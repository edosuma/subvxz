00:02.377 --> 00:03.753
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.836 --> 00:05.964
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.216
- MAYBE IT'S
THE CHAMPAGNE TALKING,

00:08.299 --> 00:10.427
BUT I THINK THERE IS
A VERY GOOD-LOOKING,

00:10.510 --> 00:12.762
VERY YOUNG MAN
STARING AT ME.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.601
- WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HIM?
HE'S OBVIOUSLY INTERESTED.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.811
- BUT HE'S A BABY.

00:19.894 --> 00:23.773
- SO GO TAKE CANDY FROM HIM.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.608
- MAYBE A QUICK "HELLO".

00:25.692 --> 00:28.319
NO ONE THAT AGE IN L.A.
WOULD EVER LOOK AT ME.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.155
- NO ONE IN CLEVELAND EITHER.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.948
THE DUDE'S BLIND.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.742
- HE'S BLIND?

00:33.825 --> 00:37.328
- THIS OUGHT TO BE GOOD.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.956
- YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
SAY IT'S RUDE TO STARE.

00:40.039 --> 00:42.083
LUCKY FOR YOU,
I'M NOT ONE OF THEM.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.794
- WAS I STARING?
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.838
- IT'S CUTE, YOUR TRYING
TO TAKE IT BACK.

00:46.921 --> 00:50.967
BUT IT'S OKAY.
I'M NOT BLIND.

00:51.050 --> 00:54.304
I MEAN,
BEING BLIND IS GREAT.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.515
I MEAN, NOT LIKE,
"YAY!" GREAT, BUT, YOU KNOW,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.976
"GOOD FOR YOU" GREAT.

01:00.059 --> 01:02.020
OH, GOD.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.813
THE NICE THING IS,
YOU WON'T SEE ME LEAVING.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.482
SORRY I BOTHERED YOU.
- [laughs] DON'T GO.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.026
YOU'RE FUNNY.
AND YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.820
- OH, THANK YOU.
I'M JOY.

01:10.904 --> 01:11.988
- I'M MARK.

01:12.071 --> 01:13.823
- HERE'S YOUR ORDER, SIR.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.492
- LISTEN, I HAVE TO RUN,

01:15.575 --> 01:17.660
BUT MAYBE WE CAN
HAVE A DRINK SOMETIME?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.497
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.373
CAN I ASK HOW OLD YOU ARE?

01:22.457 --> 01:25.335
- PEOPLE SAY I LOOK YOUNG,
BUT I'M 22.

01:25.418 --> 01:29.672
- AH. I'M A LITTLE
OLDER THAN THAT.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.509
- WHAT, LIKE, 26?
- EXACTLY.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.385
IN THREE WEEKS.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.929
- REALLY?

01:36.012 --> 01:37.639
- REALLY.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.307
HERE'S MY I.D.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.893
- HUH.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.396
I WOULD'VE GUESSED YOUNGER.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.689
[phone beeps]

01:46.773 --> 01:48.983
- AH! I HAVE A HUGE
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.485
IT'S FROM MY DAUGHTER, EMMY.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.320
SHE SAYS SHE HAS A HUGE
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.656
DRAMA QUEEN.

01:56.115 --> 01:57.367
UH, SHE'S COMING TO CLEVELAND,

01:57.450 --> 01:59.160
AND SHE'S BRINGING HER FIANCE.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.204
- OH.
- HE HAS DARK HAIR,

02:01.287 --> 02:05.667
IS ATHLETIC, SEXY--
OH, MY GOD.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.835
I BET IT'S A-ROD.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.419
- A-ROD? FROM THE YANKEES?

02:08.502 --> 02:11.714
- BOO!

02:11.798 --> 02:13.007
- IT WAS INEVITABLE.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.884
SEE, A-ROD DID
A GUEST APPEARANCE

02:14.968 --> 02:18.054
ON EMMY'S SPANISH SOAP OPERA,
<i>CHICA BLANCA LOCA.</i>

02:18.137 --> 02:19.347
HE WAS A RICH LATIN LOVER,

02:19.430 --> 02:22.559
AND SHE WAS
A SCHEMING GOLD DIGGER.

02:22.642 --> 02:26.688
- AND WHAT DID THEY
PLAY ON THE SHOW?

02:26.771 --> 02:28.481
- WELL, THIS IS A FIRST.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.024
I'M GOING OUT
WITH A BLIND GUY.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.569
- THAT'S GREAT.
AND HE'S REALLY CUTE.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.028
- YEAH.
- AND THE BEST NEWS IS,

02:34.112 --> 02:36.573
HE THINKS I'M 26.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.200
- SO HE'S BLIND AND DUMB?

02:39.284 --> 02:42.537
BY THE END OF IT,
HE'LL WISH HE WAS DEAF TOO.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.915
[laughter]

02:45.999 --> 02:47.542
OOH.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.087
- HEY, LET'S PICK UP
THE PACE, PEOPLE.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.422
EMMY JUST TEXTED ME.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.048
THE LIMO IS ON THE WAY
FROM THE AIRPORT.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.717
- CHECK IT.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.553
TEXTING'S LIKE A FLAGRATE SPELL
IN <i> THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS.</i>

02:58.636 --> 03:01.598
FOR REALS.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.099
- WHY ARE YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

03:03.182 --> 03:05.435
- BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE
26 FOR MY DATE.

03:05.518 --> 03:10.565
AND HARRY POTTER IS KIND OF
A BIG DEAL FOR PEOPLE MY AGE.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.233
I GOT THIS.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.278
THE KID'S
GONNA BE TOTES INTO ME.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.114
- OH, THOSE SMELL GOOD.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.116
- UH, THEY'RE FOR A-ROD.

CAJUN PEPPER AND LAXATIVES.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.832
- THEY'RE HERE.
PLACES, EVERYONE.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.170
- MOTHER, DEAREST.
I'VE ARRIVED.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.838
- OH, EMMY DARLING.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.965
I AM SO EXCITED
TO MEET YOUR FIANCE.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.259
- OH, HE'S JUST
GETTING THE LUGGAGE.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.929
MELANIE,
THIS IS SO, SO SPECIAL.

03:41.012 --> 03:44.265
- OKAY.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.184
- HELLO, EMMY.
- HEY, MOM.

03:46.267 --> 03:50.480
- WILL! AW, HONEY.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.607
WILL.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.985
- WILL! GREAT TIMING,
YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET A-ROD.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.196
- WHY IS A-ROD COMING HERE?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.657
- WELL,
ISN'T HE YOUR FIANCE?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.660
- WILL IS MY FIANCE. DUH.
[laughs]

04:03.743 --> 04:05.495
AND I KNOW
IT'S AWFULLY SUDDEN,

04:05.578 --> 04:07.455
BUT WE'RE
HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.332
NOW, GO PUT
THE BAGS BY THE STAIRS.

04:09.415 --> 04:13.169
- AH, ISN'T SHE GREAT?

04:13.252 --> 04:16.214
- THAT WAS SHOCKING.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.716
JOY, HAVE A CUPCAKE.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.182
- WELL, SO--OUR KIDS
ARE ENGAGED.

04:26.265 --> 04:27.517
- YEAH.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.853
- IT IS JUST, SO...
UH, UNEXPECTED.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.689
- AND...

04:32.772 --> 04:35.149
I'M PREGNANT!

04:35.233 --> 04:36.693
- [gasp]

04:36.776 --> 04:38.653
- NOT REALLY. I JUST THOUGHT
WE NEEDED A DRAMATIC MOMENT

04:38.736 --> 04:40.405
TO EASE THE TENSION.

04:40.488 --> 04:45.743
- [laughs] I GET IT.
- [laughs] THAT'S CRAZY.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.130
{\an8}- EMMY, DEAREST, HOW COULD THIS
HAVE POSSIBLY HAPPENED?

04:57.213 --> 04:59.674
{\an8}- WELL, IT WAS
VERY ROMANTIC, ACTUALLY.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.926
{\an8}AS YOU KNOW, I WAS DATING
A CERTAIN BASEBALL PLAYER.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.555
{\an8}- BOO!

05:05.638 --> 05:08.099
{\an8}- AND THEN THERE WAS THE ACTOR
WHO BROKE UP WITH ME.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.726
{\an8}- ARE YOU HEARING THIS?
- YEAH.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.353
{\an8}CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE CHOSE ME
OVER ALL THOSE OTHER GUYS?

05:12.437 --> 05:15.189
{\an8}- ALL THOSE OTHER GUYS.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.234
{\an8}- IT'S SO BEAST
THAT YOU TWO GOT TOGETHER.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.403
{\an8}- I KNOW, RIGHT?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.447
{\an8}I MEAN, THERE I WAS,
IN BETWEEN RELATIONSHIPS

05:22.530 --> 05:23.740
{\an8}BACK IN L.A., AND I WALK
INTO THE RESTAURANT

05:23.823 --> 05:25.074
{\an8}WHERE WILL IS WAITING TABLES.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.868
{\an8}I LOOKED ACROSS THE ROOM

05:26.951 --> 05:28.953
{\an8}AND I HAD THIS MAGICAL MOMENT
THAT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.371
{\an8}- YOU SAW WILL.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.790
{\an8}- BRAD PITT.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.542
{\an8}BUT WILL WAS WAITING ON HIM,

05:34.625 --> 05:36.878
{\an8}AND HE WALKED OVER WITH
WATER AND FOOD, AND I THOUGHT,

05:36.961 --> 05:38.713
{\an8}"NOW, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO CAN
REALLY TAKE CARE OF ME".

05:38.796 --> 05:40.089
{\an8}- AND I WILL.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.924
{\an8}I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON HER
SINCE I WAS 12.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.427
{\an8}- OH.
- OH, ISN'T THAT JUST LIKE LOVE?

05:44.510 --> 05:46.721
{\an8}STRIKING WHETHER
IT'S A GOOD IDEA OR NOT.

05:46.804 --> 05:47.930
{\an8}[doorbell rings]

05:48.014 --> 05:50.099
{\an8}- OH, THERE'S MY 22-YEAR-OLD.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.976
{\an8}HE THINKS I'M 26.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.520
{\an8}- IS HE BLIND?
- YES.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.234
- YO, MARK-AY.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.944
HOW YA LIVIN'?

AND GET MONEY?

06:06.324 --> 06:08.409
- YOU KNOW IT.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.083
- THAT GUY IS REALLY HOT.
- HMM.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.920
YET HE CAN'T EVEN LOOK
AT HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.172
- THAT POOR, BLIND, HOT BASTARD.
- MM.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.508
- SO, I GUESS YOU GUYS
WOULD BE

06:23.591 --> 06:25.968
UNCOMFORTABLE STAYING IN
THE SAME ROOM, RIGHT? RIGHT.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.470
- OF COURSE NOT.
WILL, HELP ME UNPACK.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.679
- I'M JUST GONNA
GET A SNACK FIRST.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.975
- UH, YOU ATE ON THE PLANE.
PIGGY HERE LOVES HIS SNACKS.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.229
- SHE CALLS ME "PIGGY".
- [nervous laugh]

06:37.897 --> 06:38.981
OKAY, I GUESS WE'RE HAPPY
FOR THEM.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.025
ALTHOUGH I MUST SAY,

06:41.109 --> 06:42.610
EMMY IS NOT WHO
I IMAGINED MY SON

06:42.693 --> 06:43.986
SPENDING THE REST
OF HIS LIFE WITH.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.613
- THEY'RE JUST GETTING MARRIED.

06:45.696 --> 06:49.992
THEY'RE NOT SPENDING THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES WITH EACH OTHER.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.662
- FOR SOME PEOPLE,
THAT'S WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.790
- BUT EMMY IS NOT "SOME PEOPLE."
NO, SHE HAS DATED STARS

06:55.873 --> 07:01.003
ON TWO CONTINENTS
AND SOUTH AMERICA.

07:01.087 --> 07:05.967
BUT THIS IS HER FIRST WAITER.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.136
AND HE'S NOT EVEN A STRUGGLING
ACTOR, YOU KNOW,

07:08.219 --> 07:10.346
WHICH WOULD ALMOST EXCUSE IT.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.807
- HE'S STUDYING
TO BE A SOCIAL WORKER.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.350
- OH, HONEY, YOU'RE
ONLY MAKING IT WORSE.

07:14.433 --> 07:17.186
NOW, LISTEN, THIS IS
SENDING US DOWN A BAD ROAD.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.312
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.022
MAYBE THEY'LL JUST
SNAP OUT OF IT.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.024
- WE CAN'T COUNT ON THAT.
I'VE HAD MARRIAGES

07:22.108 --> 07:26.696
I HAVEN'T SNAPPED OUT OF
UNTIL TWO MARRIAGES LATER.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.532
- SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY

07:29.615 --> 07:32.368
TO DESTROY THEIR HAPPINESS
THROUGH MEDDLING?

07:32.451 --> 07:36.539
- I BELIEVE IT'S PRONOUNCED,
"MOTHERING".

07:36.622 --> 07:37.832
- OKAY.
- YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.295
- SO MAYBE WE SHOULD

07:42.378 --> 07:44.005
TRY TALKING TO THEM AGAIN
WHEN THEY WAKE UP.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.882
- OH, THEY'RE UP. I KNOW YOUR
DAUGHTER'S AN ACTRESS,

07:45.965 --> 07:47.967
BUT SHE ALSO LIKES
TO DIRECT--LOUDLY.

07:48.050 --> 07:52.013

YES, I'LL HOLD FOR A-ROD.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.056
- ELKA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.392
- EMMY GAVE HER HIS NUMBER SO
SHE COULD MESS WITH HIS HEAD.

07:56.475 --> 07:59.020
- HEY, A-ROD.

07:59.103 --> 08:02.565
IS DEREK JETER AS SWEET
AND HANDSOME AS EVERYONE SAYS?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.358
- WILL YOU PLEASE HANG UP?

HE COULD STILL BE
MY FUTURE SON-IN-LAW.

HE'S CRYING.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.076

NO, THERE, THERE.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.412
THE ONLY REASON
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU

08:16.495 --> 08:19.290
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD.

WITH WEMMY?

- WHO?

08:44.357 --> 08:48.402
- WILL AND EMMY.

TO EMMY, AND YOU TALK TO WILL?

- THAT'S NOT BAD.

AND WILL IS SCARED OF ME.

- FROM WHEN YOU SWAM NAKED
IN OUR SWIMMING POOL.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.672
- WELL, I KIND OF HAVE BIG NEWS.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS BEFORE

09:49.755 --> 09:51.507
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.509
BUT I'M ON THE LIST FOR
AN EXPERIMENTAL OPERATION

09:53.592 --> 09:56.762
TO GET MY SIGHT BACK...
AND A SPOT HAS COME OPEN!

09:56.846 --> 09:58.806
- WHEN?
- THURSDAY.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.852
- I NEED SOMETHING
THAT WILL MAKE ME LOOK 26.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.228
- CAN'T YOU TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

10:04.312 --> 10:07.857
- AND RISK LOSING HIM?
BEING WITH HIM IS SO PROFOUND.

10:07.940 --> 10:12.695
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?
HE'S 22--THE SEX IS AMAZING.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.864
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PAYING
22-YEAR-OLDS NOT TO WORK

10:14.947 --> 10:17.992
JUST SO THEY CAN
HAVE SEX WITH OLDER WOMEN.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.661
- WELL, GREAT SEX IS A GOOD
REASON TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC,

10:20.745 --> 10:22.580
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
YOUR OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.124
- I SHOULD ADD, I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S LEGAL, OR SAFE.

10:25.207 --> 10:29.545
- AH, THAT CHANGES THINGS.
HOW SOON CAN YOU GET TO ECUADOR?

10:29.628 --> 10:32.048
- HE MIGHT HAVE
HIS SIGHT BACK BY THURSDAY.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.383
- RIGHT. I'LL NEVER GET
A FACE DONOR BY THEN ANYWAY.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.887
NOW, THERE IS SOMETHING CLOSER
TO HOME THAT I'VE HEARD OF.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.347
THE GENE TREATMENT.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.348
A BRILLIANT DOCTOR--

10:40.431 --> 10:42.600
- DOCTOR GENE?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.727
- ACTUALLY, DOCTOR HANSEN.
WELL, ACTUALLY, MR. HANSEN.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.188
HE THOUGHT "DOCTOR" WAS TOO
STUFFY AND, WELL, MISLEADING.

10:47.271 --> 10:51.108
HE'S TAKEN ALL THE SCIENCE
AND HARDWARE FROM

10:51.192 --> 10:53.903
AN ABANDONED ACID-WASH JEANS
FACTORY AND REPURPOSED IT

10:53.986 --> 10:57.990
TO SMOOTH AND TIGHTEN
A WOMAN'S FACE.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.743
- STOP IT. SHE IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT GOING TO SIGN UP

11:00.826 --> 11:03.579
FOR SOME SKETCHY-SOUNDING
EXPERIMENTAL FACE TREATMENT.

11:03.662 --> 11:06.415
- BUTT OUT, MEL.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.250
- I KNOW YOU AND MY MOM
ARE CRAZY-WORRIED,

11:08.334 --> 11:09.627
BUT DON'T BE.

11:09.710 --> 11:14.256
WILL ADORES ME,
AND I LOVE HIM FOR THAT.

11:14.340 --> 11:19.303
- IT'S JUST THAT, UM, YOU'VE
BEEN ENGAGED A NUMBER OF TIMES.

11:19.387 --> 11:23.099
A NUMBER THAT IS DIVISIBLE
BY 2, 3, AND 4.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.518
- BUT THEY WERE BAD BOYS,
AND I'M OVER THEM.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.603
I MEAN, SURE, THEY'RE EXCITING,
AND YOU CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM,

11:27.686 --> 11:32.191
AND THE SEX IS AMAZING, AND YOU
THINK OF THEM NIGHT AND DAY--

11:32.274 --> 11:35.277
WHERE WAS I?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.488
- WILL, BEFORE THIS RELATIONSHIP
GOES ANY FURTHER,

11:37.571 --> 11:39.407
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.449
- WHICH IS WHAT?

11:40.533 --> 11:44.829
- OH. OH, THIS IS--
THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.664
YOU SEE,
IT'S VERY PERSONAL.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.749
BUT, WELL, WE CHASE
WOMEN SUFFER FROM--

11:48.833 --> 11:52.461
OH, GOD, THIS IS SO TOUGH.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.797
SEE, BEFORE I TURNED 30, WILL,

11:54.880 --> 11:58.634
MY BREASTS WERE AS LARGE AS
EMMY'S...LARGER, EVEN.

11:58.717 --> 12:03.264
BUT THEN I WAS STRUCK WITH--
CHEST BLIGHT.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.432
- WHAT?

12:04.515 --> 12:10.521
- EMMY IS WALKING AROUND WITH
TWO GORGEOUS TIME BOMBS.

12:10.604 --> 12:13.983
TOUCHING THEM ONLY
SPEEDS UP THE PROCESS.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.318
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.987
REALLY?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.655
[chuckles]
NO WAY.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.490
BUT REALLY?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.660
- CHEST BLIGHT.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.162
- PLEASE DON'T TAKE
THIS PERSONALLY.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.497
I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED

12:28.581 --> 12:31.834
THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO PUSH WILL AROUND.

12:31.917 --> 12:36.338
- LOOK, HE IS ONE OF THE
BEST MEN I HAVE EVER MET.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.174
AND WHILE YOU MAY SEE HIM
AS EASILY PERSUADED,

12:38.257 --> 12:41.177
I SEE IT AS, IF HE'S
GONNA BE BOSSED AROUND,

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
SHOULDN'T IT BE BY
SOMEBODY WHO LOVES HIM?

12:43.637 --> 12:46.515
- [laughs]
THAT'S AN INTERESTING SPIN.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.519
- LOOK, IF YOU WANT WILL TO COME
TO CLEVELAND MORE OFTEN,

12:50.603 --> 12:53.647
I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.566
- THAT WOULD BE NICE.

12:55.649 --> 12:56.984
- I JUST GOOGLED IT.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.278
NO SUCH THING AS CHEST BLIGHT.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.656
- YOU KNOW, GOOGLE
DOESN'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.241
- VICTORIA,
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

13:04.325 --> 13:06.202
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.
YOU'RE A GOOD MOM.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.246
- WELL, I'VE OFTEN
TOLD EMMY THAT.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.999
- I'M POOR AND UNFAMOUS.

13:12.082 --> 13:17.338
AND I'LL PROBABLY ALWAYS BE
POOR AND UNFAMOUS.

13:17.421 --> 13:20.549
BUT I CAN GUARANTEE THAT EVERY
NIGHT WHEN SHE COMES HOME,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.426
SHE'LL HAVE A MAN
WITH A SYMPATHETIC EAR,

13:22.510 --> 13:24.178
A GLASS OF WINE,

13:24.261 --> 13:26.055
AND A FOOT RUB.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.390
NOW, WHAT WOMAN
DOESN'T DESERVE THAT?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.559
- AW. WE ALL DO.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.645
- YOU REALLY ARE A GREAT MOM.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.022
- OH. IT'S SO NICE
TO HEAR THOSE WORDS

13:35.105 --> 13:37.399
COMING OUT OF
SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.902
THANK YOU.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.029
- AND WILL?
- YES?

13:42.112 --> 13:44.532
- DO YOU THINK
I COULD HAVE A FOOT RUB?

13:44.615 --> 13:47.576
- I THINK THAT WOULD BE...

13:47.660 --> 13:51.080
REALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.122
- I'M SORRY, I BLEW IT.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.625
BUT SHE WAS SAYING
SUCH NICE STUFF ABOUT WILL.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.419
- OH, AND HE WAS SAYING
SUCH NICE STUFF ABOUT ME.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.880
THEY FOUND OUR KRYPTONITE.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.882
DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

14:01.966 --> 14:03.759
- YEAH, IT SMELLS
KIND OF BLEACHY?

14:06.595 --> 14:09.390
JOY, HOW DID IT GO?
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:09.473 --> 14:10.432
- HIDEOUSLY PAINFUL.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.060
IT STINGS, AND IT ITCHES,
BUT IN A FEW MINUTES,

14:13.143 --> 14:15.563
WHEN THE BANDAGES COME OFF,
I'LL LOOK 20 YEARS YOUNGER.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.606
ALTHOUGH HE DID SAY
THERE MIGHT BE SOME REDNESS.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.233
OR PARALYSIS.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.317
IT WAS HARD TO TELL
FROM HIS ACCENT.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.154
- JEEZ, I HOPE SHE'LL BE OKAY.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.991
- YOU MEAN, LOOK OKAY.
ALL RIGHT,

14:27.074 --> 14:28.826
SO WHAT IS OUR NEW PLAN
FOR WILL AND EMMY?

14:28.909 --> 14:30.286
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:30.369 --> 14:31.620
NOBODY COULD HAVE
TALKED EITHER ONE OF US

14:31.704 --> 14:32.830
OUT OF THE MEN WE MARRIED.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.916
I THINK WE JUST NEED
TO EMBRACE IT.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.085
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CERTAIN
"DENYING REALITY" ASPECT

14:38.168 --> 14:40.296
TO THAT
THAT I FIND APPEALING.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.299
- AND WE GET TO PLAN
A WEDDING TOGETHER.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.925
AND WE GET TO HAVE
THE SAME GRANDKIDS.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.427
- AND THEY CAN
CALL YOU GRANDMA

14:46.510 --> 14:48.137
AND CALL ME VICTORIA.
[both laugh]

14:48.220 --> 14:50.639
- UH-HUH.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.934
I CAN'T GET RID OF A-ROD.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.813
OH, YES, IF IT WERE
ANY OTHER TEAM,

14:57.896 --> 15:00.357
YOU WOULD BE THE SHORTSTOP.

15:00.441 --> 15:04.987
I MEAN, IF THEY DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT FIELDING.

15:05.070 --> 15:05.988
WATERWORKS.

15:06.071 --> 15:10.284
OH, JEEZ.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.828
- AAH! OH, NO!

15:12.911 --> 15:14.622
MY FACE!

15:14.705 --> 15:15.789
- WHAT?
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

15:15.873 --> 15:17.833
- LOOK!
- OH, MY GOD.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.753
NO, YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.
THIS IS A DISASTER.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.796
- WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.465
- LOOK, TRY TO LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

15:24.548 --> 15:29.345
YOUR PROCEDURE FAILED.
MAYBE HIS WILL TOO.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.847
- SWEETIE, SO YOU'RE NOT 26.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:31.930 --> 15:37.227
ANY MAN WOULD BE
LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.689
- WHAT ARE YOU HIDING
BEHIND YOUR BACK?

15:40.773 --> 15:45.819
- OH, NOTHING.
JUST MY LUCKY CLUMP OF HAIR.

15:45.903 --> 15:49.198
- OH, MY GOD!
MY HAIR!

15:49.281 --> 15:51.200
THE PROCEDURE
IS MAKING MY HAIR FALL OUT!

15:51.283 --> 15:53.202
- DID HE SAY
THERE WOULD BE SIDE EFFECTS?

15:53.285 --> 15:54.703
- I THOUGHT HE
SAID, "AIR LOSS".

15:54.787 --> 15:57.414
I PICTURED MYSELF AS
A BEAUTIFUL ASTHMATIC.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.833
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.210
I HAVE SOME WIGS
YOU CAN LOOK AT,

16:01.293 --> 16:03.379
OR--OR AN ATTRACTIVE TURBAN?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.339
- DON'T LIE TO ME!
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO SUCH THING

16:05.422 --> 16:08.592
AS AN ATTRACTIVE TURBAN.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.927
- OKAY, YOU--YOU
DON'T NEED A TURBAN.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.220
SO YOU LOST A FEW STRANDS.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.389
YOU STILL HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL HEAD OF HAIR.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.723
HONEY, JUST GO UPSTAIRS
AND GET SOME REST, OKAY?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.684
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.353
I'M GOING TO LIE DOWN.
- OKAY.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.188
- OH! MY GOD!

16:27.903 --> 16:29.905
SO, WHAT ARE WE THINKING OF
FOR THE WEDDING?

16:29.988 --> 16:32.241
- I WAS THINKING SOMETHING
SMALL, MAYBE LIKE THE BEACH?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.910
- AW, THERE YA GO
THINKING AGAIN.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.578
IT'S GOING TO BE
A DESTINATION WEDDING,

16:36.662 --> 16:38.747
OTHERWISE,<i> INSTYLE</i>
WILL NOT COVER IT.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.250
AND IF IT'S NOT IN A MAGAZINE,
ARE YOU EVEN MARRIED?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.377
- YOU KNOW, IT REALLY DOES
NEED TO BE FABULOUS.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.046
I MEAN, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY
WEDDINGS IN A LIFETIME.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.133
- OKAY, ON TO ANOTHER
IMPORTANT TOPIC:

16:49.216 --> 16:50.592
HOW MANY GRANDKIDS
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE?

16:50.676 --> 16:52.052
- NONE.
- LOTS.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.054
NO KIDS?
- NO GRANDKIDS?

16:54.138 --> 16:57.266
- WELL, NOT UNLESS MY PUBLICIST
SAYS THAT I NEED THE PRESS.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.976
AND IN THAT CASE,
I'LL JUST HIRE A SURROGATE.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.770
- OH, I WOULD HAVE KILLED
FOR A SURROGATE.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.148
BUT I GUESS YOU ALWAYS WANT
BETTER FOR YOUR KIDS.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.067
- I'M NOT GOING
TO LET SOME STRANGER

17:07.151 --> 17:08.609
GIVE BIRTH TO OUR CHILD.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.987
- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A STRANGER.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.821
IT COULD BE OUR MAID.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.950
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

17:15.032 --> 17:15.992
- NOW, NOW, NOW, KIDS

17:16.076 --> 17:18.244
YOU JUST NEED TO CALM--
- MAYBE WE SHOULD LET THEM

17:18.328 --> 17:19.747
WORK IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.790
[mumbling]
OR POTENTIALLY NOT.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.877
- AH. YES, RIGHT.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.297
YOU KNOW, WILL WANTS
TO BE A SOCIAL WORKER.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.798
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.759
- YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.429
- HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT
I AM NOT THE BOSS OF YOU.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.476
- I'M NOT GOING AFTER HER.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.227
- GOOD.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.938
- ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.148
I MEAN, SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO GO AFTER HER.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.483
THE SCENE CALLS FOR IT.

17:47.566 --> 17:51.278
EMMY! HOLD ON,
MOMMY'S COMING.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.322
- I'M PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.990
- I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN TO KNOW HER BETTER

17:55.073 --> 17:58.160
BEFORE SHE TOLD ME TO PROPOSE.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.622
- WELL, WHAT DID
YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT?

18:01.705 --> 18:03.373
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE MOSTLY TALKED IN BED.

18:03.457 --> 18:08.378
EVERYTHING SHE SAYS IN BED
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

18:08.462 --> 18:12.132
- I'M SORRY, WILL, BUT EMMY
WANTS YOU TO COME OUTSIDE.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.510
SHE--SHE WANTS TO TWEET
A PICTURE OF HER

18:14.593 --> 18:16.845
THROWING
THE RING IN YOUR FACE.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.516
- RIGHT. I REMEMBER
INITIALING THAT IN THE PRENUP.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.811
- I'M REALLY SORRY, WILL, BUT
I THINK THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

18:23.894 --> 18:28.690
AND I KNOW THAT SOMEDAY YOU WILL
FIND THE RIGHT FEET TO MASSAGE.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.526
- THOSE AREN'T YOUR FEET, RIGHT?

18:30.609 --> 18:34.696
- HA. WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.663
- HOW'S EMMY?
- OH, YOU KNOW EMMY.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.165
SHE'S DESTROYED
AND DEVASTATED,

18:45.249 --> 18:47.751
AND SHE'S ALREADY CHANGED
HER FACEBOOK STATUS TO,

18:47.835 --> 18:50.379
"IT'S COMPLICATED",
WITH RYAN GOSLING.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.673
SO, HOW ARE WE FEELING?

18:52.756 --> 18:55.050
- OH, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I AM RELIEVED.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.886
BUT I DID KIND OF LIKE THE IDEA
OF BEING RELATED TO YOU.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.889
- HMM, ME TOO. BUT YOU KNOW,
WE ALREADY ARE LIKE FAMILY.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.641
- THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.560
BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN FUN TO BE
GRANDMOTHERS TOGETHER.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.228
- YEAH.

19:06.311 --> 19:10.858
- ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE A BALD,
CRYING BUNDLE OF JOY AT HOME.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.735
- AH, AND SHE'S PROBABLY READY

19:13.819 --> 19:15.779
FOR ANOTHER BOTTLE
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.323
- MM-HMM.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.413
- OF COURSE I'M DEVASTATED.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.416
