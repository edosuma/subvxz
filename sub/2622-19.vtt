WEBVTT

00:06.756 --> 00:11.677
Morning's here

00:11.845 --> 00:14.096
The morning's here

00:14.264 --> 00:16.682
Sunshine is here

00:16.850 --> 00:18.308
The sky is clear

00:18.476 --> 00:22.271
The morning's here

00:22.439 --> 00:23.772
Hey!

00:24.941 --> 00:28.527
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

00:29.029 --> 00:30.529
Oh, come on!

00:30.697 --> 00:32.448
Morning's here!

00:32.615 --> 00:36.160
Morning's here

00:36.327 --> 00:38.537
The morning's here

00:38.705 --> 00:41.582
Sunshine is here

00:44.377 --> 00:46.420
I hate this apartment!

00:47.881 --> 00:52.092
I hate the color of these walls!
I hate that this place still smells like bird!

00:54.304 --> 00:56.013
I hate that singing guy!

00:56.181 --> 00:59.600
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

00:59.768 --> 01:03.187
Morning's here, morning is...

01:03.354 --> 01:05.147
Stop it!

01:06.316 --> 01:07.566
I will kill you.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.738
I hate that my room is so small.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.616
I have all the space I need.
Just do what I did.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.661
Monica, you don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

01:21.581 --> 01:23.749
You know what?
I am tired of your bellyaching.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.252
I've worked really hard at making this
a nice place for us to live.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.713
I know. I'm so sorry.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.757
I'm sorry, okay?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.258
This is a great apartment.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.344
Shut up. This place is a hole.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.153
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

02:34.320 --> 02:37.406
I know, I know.
Who am I? David Bowie?

02:39.784 --> 02:40.826
He does that?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.078
- I don't know. Whatever.
- Ha, ha.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.290
Well, I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.750
- Oh, I know.
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.544
You know what?

02:50.712 --> 02:53.547
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

02:53.715 --> 02:57.259
No, really. When I'm with you, I'm like...

02:57.427 --> 03:00.179
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

03:00.430 --> 03:02.514
I mean, I love you too. A lot.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.933
But that guy!

03:05.101 --> 03:06.518
I love that guy!

03:06.686 --> 03:08.520
- I love both of you.
- Ah, heh.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.692
I wish I didn't have to go.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.777
Then don't.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.655
Stay here. Don't go so soon to London.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.199
- Just one more day.
- Oh, Ross.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.618
- One more day.
- Please don't do this to me again.

03:23.494 --> 03:27.497
You know I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.876
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.295
I wish I could.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.466
Oh, no, don't... Don't...
Don't start packing.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.426
Come on.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.972
I don't think you understand packing.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.101
I don't want to leave it
till the last minute.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.896
Last time I packed in a rush,
I left my knickers here.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.982
Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.026
You didn't!

03:56.194 --> 03:58.737
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."

04:07.914 --> 04:09.456
Hello.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.292
Ho, ho, ho.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.421
- Excuse me?
- Your pants.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.839
Oh, yeah! You like them?

04:19.007 --> 04:22.469
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.514
These are so comfortable.

04:27.850 --> 04:31.603
Uh, Pheebs, those are,
uh, Santa pants.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.898
- What?
- Santa pants.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.609
Santa Claus' pants.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.446
Nuh-uh. They're maternity pants.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.992
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

04:45.159 --> 04:48.245
These names are good,
and these are bad.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.748
Oh.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.584
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.044
Hey, Pheebs.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.880
So, how are the elves?

05:00.091 --> 05:04.386
I don't know.
How are the, uh, you know?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.015
Your clothes aren't funny.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.144
Hey, guys,
what should I wear to a Knicks game?

05:12.687 --> 05:15.147
Uh, a T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.483
You have tickets?

05:18.651 --> 05:23.030
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.407
Apparently, they're good seats.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.951
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

05:28.119 --> 05:29.828
Do you guys want these?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.372
- Yeah!
- Yeah, we do!

05:32.915 --> 05:34.291
Well, you got them!

05:34.459 --> 05:36.668
- All right!
- Just give us our apartment back.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.716
Whoa, I didn't see that coming.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.635
Are you serious?

05:45.803 --> 05:49.598
Come on. We know what these are worth.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.850
Do you think we're stupid?

05:52.018 --> 05:55.395
Not stupid. You're meaner
than I thought.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.939
- What do you say?
- Forget it.

05:58.107 --> 06:02.027
Okay? I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.613
Your "bachelor pad"?

06:04.781 --> 06:06.782
Have you even had a girl here?

06:09.452 --> 06:10.952
No.

06:11.662 --> 06:15.207
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning time.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.169
Yeah, you do.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.885
Come on!

06:27.053 --> 06:30.222
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.807
Good one.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.684
Come on. Season tickets.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.062
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.272
Forget it.
I'm not giving up the apartment.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.193
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

06:43.361 --> 06:48.281
...to the Number 1 salesman every year.
All right? My dad never won.

06:48.699 --> 06:52.619
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

06:53.913 --> 06:55.789
- Hey guys!
- Hey.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.126
Oh, my God.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.212
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

07:03.297 --> 07:05.757
Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.094
You do know that Wham broke up?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.721
Ah! Ha, ha.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.517
I like it. And Emily likes it.
And that's what counts.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.729
So, uh, how are you guys doing?

07:19.897 --> 07:23.316
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.861
Where's Emily?

07:26.028 --> 07:28.196
Ugh, she's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

07:28.364 --> 07:32.075
- Didn't she, like, just get here?
- Yeah! Yeah.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.410
Easy, tiger.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.037
I just hate this so much.

07:36.205 --> 07:40.125
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

07:40.293 --> 07:45.130
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

07:45.298 --> 07:47.883
- So, what'll you do?
- There's nothing to do.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.759
She lives there. I live here.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.596
She'd have to move here.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.473
She should move here.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.475
What?

07:56.642 --> 07:59.144
- I can ask her to live with me.
- Are you serious?

07:59.312 --> 08:02.564
- Why not? I mean, why not?
- You've only known her six weeks!

08:02.732 --> 08:06.776
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

08:07.945 --> 08:11.031
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like...

08:11.199 --> 08:15.035
Uh, she brings out this great side of me.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.621
I mean, I love her, you know?

08:17.788 --> 08:19.748
And I love the milk!

08:20.625 --> 08:23.877
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.800
Joey, you say things now.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.804
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.264
She's great!

08:36.432 --> 08:39.183
But this is too soon.
You're only gonna scare her.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.520
- I don't wanna do that.
- No.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.814
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.651
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.653
I'm not going to do it.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.365
- Thanks guys.
- No problem.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.825
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.923
It's too hard. Too hard!

09:11.133 --> 09:13.677
All right, boys.
Last chance for the tickets.

09:13.844 --> 09:17.430
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.642
No, thank you.

09:21.018 --> 09:24.229
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.856
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

09:29.860 --> 09:34.030
I want those seats as much as you.
But we can't live in the small apartment...

09:34.198 --> 09:37.117
...after we've lived here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?

09:37.285 --> 09:38.994
Yes.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.079
Ever read Sports Illustrated?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.166
No, I didn't read yours!

09:45.334 --> 09:46.918
We can go to the game tonight!

09:47.086 --> 09:49.671
The only way I'll consider this...

09:49.839 --> 09:52.132
...is if they offer more
than just season seats.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.758
- It's the Knicks!
- Screw the Knicks.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.552
Whoa!

10:00.016 --> 10:02.601
I didn't mean that. I just meant...

10:02.768 --> 10:05.770
...that the apartment is worth
so much more.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.148
Huh.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.984
And the Knicks rule all.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.611
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!

10:14.113 --> 10:15.947
Hey, so? Are you going to do it?

10:17.158 --> 10:20.410
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.703
All right, look.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.914
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

10:25.082 --> 10:26.124
Done!

10:26.917 --> 10:30.295
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.713
Ooh, we could get nothing.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.799
- Or you can end up with everything.
- Oh, I like that.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.510
What do you say?

10:37.678 --> 10:39.512
- No!
- Just do it!

10:39.680 --> 10:41.306
Oh! Oh, I'm convinced!

10:43.309 --> 10:46.645
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.147
Because you're my best friend.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.568
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.445
I'm in.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.574
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

10:59.742 --> 11:01.785
Okay. Well, we should
let Phoebe decide...

11:01.994 --> 11:06.039
...because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.167
Okay. Ha, ha. Um...

11:09.335 --> 11:11.378
Ooh, ooh. Oh, I have a game!

11:11.545 --> 11:14.172
- This is great!
- Okay. What's the game?

11:14.340 --> 11:17.759
Um, well, it doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

11:19.595 --> 11:22.222
No, it doesn't have a name. Um...

11:22.431 --> 11:24.474
Okay, Monica.

11:24.642 --> 11:28.395
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.857
- They're green?
- Good! Good, five points!

11:37.279 --> 11:39.239
All right, Joey...

11:39.490 --> 11:41.324
Same question.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.785
Uh...

11:43.953 --> 11:46.871
- Oh! Heh. They're tall.
- Ooh, three points.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.962
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.716
That's not even a game.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.968
Shut up. We're winning!

12:01.721 --> 12:04.347
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.224
High card wins.
What do you say?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.309
- Let's do it!
- Oh, I have cards!

12:08.477 --> 12:10.478
- Oh, good.
- Yeah. Here.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.147
No, these are the trick deck.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.649
Okay. Here, yes.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.817
- Ahem.
- Okay.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.402
Okay, you guys, uh, you pick first.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.028
- Okay.
- Okay?

12:22.867 --> 12:24.784
- Four.
- That's a low one!

12:24.952 --> 12:26.327
Okay.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.290
Phoebe, you look. I can't do it.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.334
- What makes you think I can?
- That's okay.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.502
Ace!

12:39.508 --> 12:41.009
Why are you hugging?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.927
Because we won our apartment back!

12:43.095 --> 12:46.264
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

12:46.432 --> 12:49.184
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

12:56.942 --> 12:58.276
I don't know.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.696
Ooh! Oh.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.073
Look it! Aah!

13:06.577 --> 13:09.245
- All right, come on, pick again!
- Okay, give me.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.164
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.958
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

13:16.962 --> 13:19.589
Aah! I know queen is high!

13:19.757 --> 13:21.174
Not as high as...

13:22.551 --> 13:23.802
It worked! King!

13:27.223 --> 13:28.932
We pick again!
We pick again!

13:29.099 --> 13:30.600
- Why?
- I don't know.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.271
- Tickets, please.
- Ugh!

13:36.357 --> 13:39.317
- That's courtside, baby!
- Yeah, ha, ha.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.237
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.450
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.619
No, they didn't.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.379
Hey.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.006
Packed while you were gone.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.634
I left some knickers under your pillow.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.179
Move in with me.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.889
What?

14:10.057 --> 14:14.769
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

14:14.937 --> 14:19.816
...but just think.
Think how great it would be.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.193
Oh...

14:22.361 --> 14:23.987
I don't know.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.699
Uh, oh, leaving London.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.784
- My whole family lives there...
- I know.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.912
- My job.
- You'll get a job here.

14:33.080 --> 14:37.125
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.335
That could be you.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.130
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.882
You come to England.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.093
I can't. I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

14:47.261 --> 14:51.264
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

14:52.474 --> 14:54.267
Oh, I don't think so.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.272
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

14:59.481 --> 15:01.941
...and we were getting married
or something.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.192
What?

15:03.652 --> 15:07.155
Uh, no, right.
I shouldn't have said "married."

15:07.323 --> 15:09.032
Uh, please don't go freaky on me.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.619
I didn't mean it.
I didn't say it. I take it back.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.120
No. Don't.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.291
Why don't we?

15:18.667 --> 15:20.501
Why don't we what?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.005
Get married.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.549
You are mad!

15:26.717 --> 15:31.638
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.933
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.685
- We've known each other six weeks!
- Yeah, I know.

15:37.853 --> 15:41.648
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

15:41.815 --> 15:46.027
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

15:46.195 --> 15:49.447
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.409
I mean, this...

15:54.119 --> 15:56.537
This makes sense for us.

15:57.915 --> 16:02.335
Come on. Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.713
I mean, last night
I got my ear pierced. Me!

16:07.466 --> 16:08.967
This feels right.

16:09.843 --> 16:10.885
Doesn't it?

16:12.721 --> 16:15.014
My parents are gonna be really mad.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.976
Is that...? Are you saying "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?

16:19.061 --> 16:20.395
Yes.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.607
- Yes!
- Yes?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.943
- We're getting married!
- Oh, my God!

16:27.111 --> 16:30.405
- Yes! Ha, ha.
- We're getting married!

16:30.781 --> 16:32.240
Come here, come here.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.747
Ow!

16:42.668 --> 16:44.168
Emily, will you marry me?

16:46.213 --> 16:47.255
Yes.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.719
Oh, it's a bit small.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.931
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.436
It was.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.202
- Those were, like, the best seats ever.
- Oh, yeah.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.955
Hey, should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

17:22.124 --> 17:25.417
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.467
Oh, God.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.516
Hey, you want a beer?

17:43.645 --> 17:45.563
- Whoa!
- I know!

17:48.859 --> 17:51.152
Open up! Open up! Open up!

17:52.446 --> 17:54.572
We'll discuss it in the morning.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.248
What the hell is going on?

18:05.125 --> 18:07.919
We took our apartment back!

18:11.507 --> 18:13.216
I had nothing to do with it.

18:16.553 --> 18:20.306
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.517
Oh, oh!

18:24.269 --> 18:27.105
We are switching back right now.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.190
No, we're not. We're not leaving!

18:29.358 --> 18:31.317
You'll have to. You both have jobs.

18:31.485 --> 18:35.154
As soon as you do, we're switching back!
There's nothing you can do to stop us.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.739
Right, Joe?

18:36.907 --> 18:37.949
I don't know.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.037
What?

18:43.539 --> 18:45.957
I don't want to move again, with...

18:48.168 --> 18:50.837
I don't care! This is our apartment
and they stole...

18:51.004 --> 18:53.256
You stole!

18:53.423 --> 18:56.551
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

18:56.718 --> 19:00.555
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

19:02.141 --> 19:03.599
All right.

19:04.393 --> 19:08.855
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

19:09.022 --> 19:12.066
Oh, no more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

19:12.234 --> 19:16.612
- Let us keep the apartment and...
- As a thank you...

19:20.033 --> 19:22.410
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.625
- Totally worth it.
- That was one good minute.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.711
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.427
- Men are such idiots.
- I know.

19:39.595 --> 19:44.265
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

19:44.433 --> 19:47.727
It's funny. If you had just done that
after the last contest...

19:47.895 --> 19:50.104
...no one would have
had to move at all. Ha, ha.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.985
- Let's pretend that's not true.
- Yeah.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.448
Okay. Scarf's done.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.495
- Come on. Come on, come on!
- Okay.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.873
- Hey!
- Hey.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.082
What's going on?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.293
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.878
Uh...

20:14.546 --> 20:16.839
Well, okay. It's, uh... Ahem.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.592
Emily and I, we decided to, uh...

20:19.760 --> 20:21.594
...to get married.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.806
- What?
- Oh, my God.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.392
Oh, are you pregnant too?

20:30.479 --> 20:31.938
No.

20:32.105 --> 20:35.107
When did...? How did you...?

20:35.275 --> 20:38.152
We just decided to go for it.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.489
We know it's a bit hasty, but, uh...

20:41.657 --> 20:43.824
...it just feels so right.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.748
Um, I was just telling the guys...

20:50.916 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, I heard.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.634
I think it's great! Aah!

21:01.802 --> 21:03.261
I'm so happy for you!

21:03.428 --> 21:04.845
Well, yeah! Congratulations!

21:14.189 --> 21:16.524
- I can't believe you're getting married!
- Yeah.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.613
Monica and Rachel made out.

21:33.333 --> 21:37.295
Morning's here

21:37.462 --> 21:40.131
The morning's here

21:40.299 --> 21:42.842
Sunshine is here

21:43.010 --> 21:44.552
The sky is clear

21:44.720 --> 21:47.221
The morning's here

21:47.389 --> 21:48.597
- Hey, you're back!
- Hey!

21:48.765 --> 21:52.768
- Get into gear
- Breakfast is near

21:52.936 --> 21:58.065
The dark of night has disappeared

21:58.233 --> 22:01.777
- I'll see you tomorrow morning!
- Okay!
