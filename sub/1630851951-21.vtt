you wouldn't walk

yesterday gave me a big scare,

14:19.593 --> 14:22.927

to thinking how selfish I was

14:23.063 --> 14:25.063
to worry my family and,
you know,

14:25.198 --> 14:27.131

What's going on?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.687
- I don't know.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.923
- For the past two years,

14:52.058 --> 14:55.126
Ms. Marilyn has been battling
brain cancer.

14:55.262 --> 15:00.632
- But she seemed perfectly fine,
just as sharp as the rest of us.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.201
- Fortunately, her tumor
was in a part of her brain

15:03.336 --> 15:07.071
that didn't affect
her ability to function.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.907
- Was she aware of the tumor,
that she had it?

15:10.043 --> 15:12.610
- CORA: Yes, ma'am.
- Very much so.

15:12.746 --> 15:17.582
She had, uh, several surgeries,
gone through chemo,

15:17.717 --> 15:20.218
uh, radiation therapy...
- Yes.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.554
- It was just...
a very aggressive tumor

15:23.690 --> 15:25.690
that kept coming back.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.992
- So, she decided with the time
that she had left

15:28.128 --> 15:30.528
to just enjoy life...

15:30.664 --> 15:33.865
versus just being cooped up
in a hospital.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.533
- You know, I knew
something was wrong,

15:35.669 --> 15:37.635
she was moving kind
of slow lately, you know?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.437
You notice it?
- Mm-hm.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.873
Well, her doctor gave
her six months to live,

15:42.008 --> 15:45.977
and...she fought hard,
and made it two.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.245

- You just never know
when it's gonna be your time.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.892
- I think she knew
that she was leaving,

16:01.027 --> 16:03.995
and she was preparing us
all for her exit.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.530

16:05.665 --> 16:10.435
