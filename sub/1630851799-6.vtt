'cause you never know

04:38.094 --> 04:42.272
Kathy requested the caviar
served at the table,

04:44.934 --> 04:46.451

I let go

I let go of my marriage.
I let go of everything.

06:00.343 --> 06:04.938

further and further out.

to have were now reduced

07:36.606 --> 07:39.115

to work it out and tried.

07:45.207 --> 07:48.249

Crystal was telling me about
why she didn't come to dinner.

13:48.403 --> 13:50.987
- Sutton didn't mean any harm.
- She didn't? I don't know.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.331
- Walking into someone's room
and they're undressed.

13:53.408 --> 13:54.615
- Apparently, she didn't knock.

13:54.692 --> 13:56.450
- But even if you don't knock,

13:56.527 --> 13:58.327
you know there's
no ill intention.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.496
- But I feel like when you know
they're not dressed,

14:00.507 --> 14:01.731
you walk out.
- She did.

14:01.733 --> 14:03.499
- You have respect.
- She gave the coat,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.960
and Sutton left--
she didn't hang out.

14:06.037 --> 14:07.679
- Well, I was, like, naked
in my room, and she's like,

14:07.755 --> 14:10.131
"What are you doing in here?"

14:10.207 --> 14:12.016
While I'm crouched
on the ground naked,

14:12.093 --> 14:14.018
and she's, like,
laughing at me.

14:14.095 --> 14:16.512
And she sort of tried to, like,
shame me, and it was weird.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.014
And I'm like...

14:18.024 --> 14:19.858
It was so creepy.
- Oh, my God.

14:19.934 --> 14:22.861
- She felt like
she was violated.

14:22.937 --> 14:24.979
- Well...

14:25.056 --> 14:26.689
I think it's
a dangerous implication

14:26.700 --> 14:27.866
to say you felt violated.

14:27.942 --> 14:30.484
The word "violated"
sounds a lot worse

14:30.561 --> 14:33.371
than the conversation I had
with Crystal in Lake Tahoe.

14:33.448 --> 14:34.873
- Last night Sutton walked in.

14:34.949 --> 14:36.449
Like, she was
returning a jacket.

14:36.525 --> 14:37.876
- Yeah.
- But she doesn't knock.

14:37.952 --> 14:39.994
She just comes over, and, like,
I'm naked in my room.

14:40.071 --> 14:41.362
So, anyways, I'm just like--

14:41.439 --> 14:42.881
- You didn't want to come
to dinner because of that?

14:42.957 --> 14:44.707
- Yeah.
- But Dorit is implying

14:44.718 --> 14:46.125
that maybe there was
something sinister,

14:46.202 --> 14:49.387
like Sutton had
weird intentions or something.

14:49.464 --> 14:51.047
It was an awkward moment.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.882

- Kind.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.011
- Loving. Loyal.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.013
Monogamous.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.682
Sweet. Sexy.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.017
- Sexy.
- Not too big.

17:08.028 --> 17:12.697
- Oh.
[laughing]

17:12.774 --> 17:14.190
I was like--
- That's a thing!

17:14.200 --> 17:16.034
- You caught me off guard
for a second.

17:16.110 --> 17:18.611
- There is such a thing
as too big of a diamond.

17:18.687 --> 17:21.614
- Okay, okay, so looking
at this board here,

17:21.690 --> 17:26.202
I want to talk about your past
patterns in a relationship.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.713
- I think the way I show up
when I'm dating--

17:28.790 --> 17:30.873
I think I have to stop leading
with my career.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.241
- Yeah, your stuff.

17:32.243 --> 17:34.293
- I think sometimes guys
would probably want me

17:34.370 --> 17:36.879
to be more needy, and I'm not--
I think that's a thing.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.965
- I want you to be you.
It's all about authenticity.

17:40.042 --> 17:42.051
It's being your most
authentic self.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.053
- I left home
when I was 17 years old.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.889
So I've been taking care
of myself for a long time.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.307
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.384 --> 17:50.068
- The opportunities that
I'm getting I have to take,

17:50.144 --> 17:52.195
because that's the privilege.

17:54.982 --> 17:56.240
[voice breaking]
That's the privilege

17:56.317 --> 17:58.743
that my mom brought me
to this country for,

17:58.820 --> 18:00.319
and so I have to take it.

18:00.396 --> 18:04.323
I have to do well, so it's
always been I take care of me.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.200
I take care of myself.

18:06.277 --> 18:07.442
- Mm-hmm.

18:07.444 --> 18:09.587
- Letting someone completely
have my back

18:09.664 --> 18:11.747
is me relinquishing my power.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.916
<i> I'm always like,</i>
<i> "I got it. I can do it."</i>

18:13.927 --> 18:15.927
And I think it's because
I don't trust somebody

18:16.003 --> 18:17.920
will truly have my back.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.755
- But what would it feel like,
Garcelle,

18:19.766 --> 18:21.766
if you could let go,
for a second

18:21.843 --> 18:25.603
and let somebody else
tell you, "I got you"?

18:25.680 --> 18:27.179
- I want to get to there.

18:27.256 --> 18:28.848
- This is all part
of the process.

18:28.924 --> 18:31.776
On the other side of it is
the relationship that you want,

18:31.853 --> 18:33.945
and that's what you deserve.

18:34.021 --> 18:35.279
- Thank you.

18:35.356 --> 18:36.781
This is therapy.

18:36.858 --> 18:39.024
I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

18:39.101 --> 18:40.901

traffic would be no problem."

21:36.037 --> 21:38.620
And Tom straight looked at him
across the table and said,

"Well, if you think you can
afford her, you can have her."

- Oh, no way.

<i> - Beautiful.</i>
<i> - Thank you.</i>

34:16.296 --> 34:17.387
<i> - Yeah.</i>
<i> - Thank you. Thank you.</i>

34:17.464 --> 34:18.463
<i> - Stunning.</i>

34:18.540 --> 34:20.891
- Hi. How are you?

34:20.967 --> 34:23.134
- Hi.
- Hi, everybody.

34:23.211 --> 34:25.720
- Wow.
- [laughs]

34:25.731 --> 34:29.232
- Wow. When my life started
unraveling with my divorce,

34:29.309 --> 34:30.975
<i> I didn't want to do anything.</i>

34:31.052 --> 34:34.062
But Erika walks
in like sex in heels.

34:34.073 --> 34:37.482
- I was--you know,
she's got a new moment going.

34:37.559 --> 34:39.317
- She is down for whatever.

34:39.394 --> 34:41.820
I don't know what she's down
for, but she's down for it.

34:41.896 --> 34:43.196
- I'll be right back.
Please excuse me.

34:43.273 --> 34:45.749
I'm so sorry.
- What are you guys drinking?

34:45.826 --> 34:47.408
- Scooch by.
- Can I get you a drink?

34:47.419 --> 34:49.869
- Yes.
Can you make a hot toddy?

34:49.946 --> 34:52.756
- I believe we can.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

34:52.833 --> 34:55.333
I would like to tell a story.
- Oh, okay.

34:55.410 --> 34:58.837
- Oh, that little present
you gave me, I used it.

34:58.913 --> 35:01.431
- Which present?
- Which present. The oil.

35:01.508 --> 35:05.093
- Oh!
- I am lit.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.720
- Right now?
- Right now.

35:07.797 --> 35:11.224
There is this intimate oil
that Kyle gifted--

35:11.301 --> 35:13.852
- Is it CBD?
- It's THC.

35:13.928 --> 35:16.855
She's been telling us
about this oil

35:16.931 --> 35:19.732
that she and Mauricio
have been enjoying.

35:19.809 --> 35:22.360
So I said, "Hook a girl up."
- Okay.

35:22.437 --> 35:25.738
- I put it all over my clit
and all over my va-jay-jay.

35:25.815 --> 35:28.741
[all scream]
- Yes!

35:28.818 --> 35:30.034
- Yes!

35:30.111 --> 35:32.078
- I think it's working.

35:32.155 --> 35:34.289
You're like, "I'm lit."
[laughter]

35:34.299 --> 35:37.750
I think it's working.
I think it's working, guys.

35:37.827 --> 35:41.129
- All I want to know is,
how do I get my hands on some?

35:41.140 --> 35:43.214
- I'll be back in five minutes.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.975
Sutton.
- What's up?

35:45.051 --> 35:46.926
- I want to talk to you.
- What's up?

35:47.003 --> 35:49.804
- So the reason I just wanted
to pull you aside

35:49.815 --> 35:51.431
is because
it was brought up to me

35:51.507 --> 35:53.808
that people are still
talking about us, right?

35:53.819 --> 35:54.967
- Oh, I was gonna bring it up.

35:55.045 --> 35:56.269
- I have to imagine
it's annoying you,

35:56.346 --> 35:57.937
and it's annoying me.

35:58.014 --> 36:01.149
- See, here's the thing--
I think it's very dangerous

36:01.160 --> 36:04.327
when we talk about each other
behind each other's backs.

36:04.404 --> 36:06.821
- I agree.
Like, I had promised you,

36:06.832 --> 36:08.907
and you promised
we wouldn't talk about this.

36:08.983 --> 36:11.284
- You didn't do your promise.

36:11.361 --> 36:13.328
- No, people keep bringing
it up to me.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.130
- Can I ask what happened?

36:28.261 --> 36:31.137
I would love to never talk
about this again,

36:31.214 --> 36:34.807
but everyone keeps asking me
about it, so I have to respond.

36:34.884 --> 36:36.601
- If she didn't want
to talk about it,

36:36.678 --> 36:38.311
she wouldn't talk about it.

36:38.388 --> 36:40.438
You know,
I don't want to fight.

36:40.515 --> 36:41.555
- Agreed.

36:41.557 --> 36:43.524
- Can you hold this
for one second

36:43.535 --> 36:46.444
while I don't have
another Sofitel moment?

36:46.521 --> 36:50.156
- Erika, sorry, but Kyle
needs some underwear.

36:50.233 --> 36:52.200
- I don't have any.
- Oh!

36:52.211 --> 36:53.326
[laughter]

36:53.403 --> 36:56.537
- Your tweeter is escaping.
[laughing]

36:56.548 --> 36:58.456
- Listen, it has not.
- Aah!

36:58.533 --> 37:01.459
- I want to see it!
- But it's about to.

37:01.536 --> 37:03.461
- Let's just have
clarification...

37:03.538 --> 37:05.004
- That's all I want.
- And walk away.

37:05.081 --> 37:06.297
- So why don't we...
- Yeah.

37:06.374 --> 37:07.390
- Go out there?
- Yeah.

37:07.467 --> 37:08.841
- And then we'll
be done with it.

37:08.918 --> 37:10.134
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

37:10.211 --> 37:11.552
- I'm cool.
- That's all I wanted.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.472
- I'm giving myself 90 days.
2021, it's on.

37:14.549 --> 37:16.233
- 90 days for what?
- No sex.

37:16.309 --> 37:17.976
It's the last thing on my mind,

37:18.052 --> 37:20.478
but in 90 days,
I'm sure I feel different.

37:20.555 --> 37:22.063
- Yes.
- Hi, girls.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.573
- Hi.
- [laughs]

37:23.650 --> 37:25.149
- That was honest
of you, though.

37:25.226 --> 37:26.409
- Yeah. I'm glad you
shared that with us.

37:26.486 --> 37:29.070
- Oh, look at me
being just so honest and open.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.563
- It's great.
- It is.

37:30.640 --> 37:31.990
- Crystal and I have something
to share with the group.

37:32.066 --> 37:33.416
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, okay.

37:33.493 --> 37:37.328
- So, in Tahoe, I went to go
take

37:37.405 --> 37:40.540
Crystal's coat back to her.

37:40.616 --> 37:42.667
It was an awkward moment.
- Yes.

37:42.744 --> 37:45.420
- And it's something
that we talked about privately.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.172
- Yes. And, look, like I said,
it is over.

37:48.249 --> 37:50.508
And it's important for us to
let the girls know it is over.

37:50.585 --> 37:52.510
- Well, see,
but if it's over,

37:52.587 --> 37:54.554
you have to stop talking
about it to other people.

37:54.630 --> 37:56.556
- I'm not talking
about it anymore.

37:56.632 --> 38:00.360
- But it's a little defamatory
to say that I violated you.

38:05.841 --> 38:07.692
- It is over,
and it's important for us

38:07.769 --> 38:09.068
to let the girls know
it is truly over.

38:09.145 --> 38:10.361
- Well, see,
but if it's over,

38:10.438 --> 38:12.613
you have to stop talking
about it to other people.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.449
- I'm not talking
about it anymore.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.285
- But it's a little defamatory
to say that I violated you.

38:17.296 --> 38:20.297
- I don't really understand
why Sutton wants

38:20.373 --> 38:21.581
to keep bringing it up.

38:21.657 --> 38:25.043
Sutton, I am trying
to do you a favor

38:25.119 --> 38:26.586
by making this thing go away.

38:26.662 --> 38:28.629
I felt like there was
no boundaries in that moment.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.548
- She was crouched down.
- I had no privacy.

38:30.625 --> 38:32.976
- And she felt like Sutton--
- Hold on, Dorit.

38:33.053 --> 38:35.219
- Dorit, I don't know
why you got your paws in this.

38:35.296 --> 38:37.096
- I've only had a conversation
with Crystal.

38:37.173 --> 38:38.315
I never heard your side,

38:38.391 --> 38:40.317
and I tried to put myself
in her shoes.

38:40.393 --> 38:43.153
Her entire experience
with you was bad.

38:43.229 --> 38:44.437
- Was in Tahoe.
- Yeah.

38:44.514 --> 38:47.648
- But it's over.
It's really over.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.150
- That's great.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.110
So, while we're on this topic,

38:51.187 --> 38:54.739
we struggled in Tahoe,
but I'm not crazy.

38:54.816 --> 38:57.000
- Sure.
- Calling me manic...

38:57.077 --> 38:58.618
- I don't trust
being around you.

38:58.694 --> 39:01.579
I don't trust your reactions.
It feels like kind of manic.

39:01.656 --> 39:05.124
- We had had a really nice
conversation about my father...

39:05.201 --> 39:06.459
- Yes, we talked
about our fathers.

39:06.536 --> 39:07.460
- And his suicide.

39:07.537 --> 39:09.087
It took my mom a long time--

39:09.163 --> 39:11.297
My dad committed suicide,
so it's--

39:11.374 --> 39:12.423
- I'm sorry.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.092
- You used the word "manic."

39:14.168 --> 39:16.761
I don't have those issues
in my life.

39:16.838 --> 39:18.513
<i> - Sutton is harmless.</i>

39:18.523 --> 39:22.141
She's a little odd and a little
kooky, but manic, crazy--

39:22.218 --> 39:24.143
<i> those are really strong words</i>

39:24.220 --> 39:26.646
to be throwing
at another woman really.

39:26.722 --> 39:29.148
- I had a bad two days.

39:29.225 --> 39:31.275
- I'm going to...

39:31.352 --> 39:33.653
I'm going to believe you.

39:33.729 --> 39:36.614
- Right.
- Yeah.

39:36.691 --> 39:40.034
- "I'm gonna believe you."
[sighs]

39:40.045 --> 39:41.619
<i> She's a mean girl.</i>
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

39:41.696 --> 39:43.788
<i> She is</i>
<i> a mean high-school girl.</i>

39:43.865 --> 39:46.332
I see these things.

39:46.409 --> 39:49.210
- Like I said, I promise you,
I don't bring it up.

39:49.221 --> 39:52.505
- I believe you.
I believe you.

39:52.582 --> 39:54.057
Look at me.

39:54.134 --> 39:56.342
Picture of normal health
right here.

39:56.419 --> 39:58.803
- Sure.
- [laughter]

39:58.880 --> 40:00.121
- Why are y'all laughing?

40:00.123 --> 40:02.390
- That's pushing it
a little bit, but okay.

40:02.401 --> 40:05.643
- I want to move forward
and have fun tonight.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.311
- Let's do it.

40:07.388 --> 40:09.397
- Let's do it.
- Let's go--dumplings!

40:09.408 --> 40:13.234
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

40:13.245 --> 40:14.861
- Hi.

40:14.937 --> 40:16.579
Garcelle.
Nice to meet you.

40:16.656 --> 40:18.698
- This is my cousin--
Angie and Tiffany.

40:18.774 --> 40:20.074
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.200
- Hi, guys.

40:21.277 --> 40:22.827
- You guys have
your own aprons...

40:22.904 --> 40:24.254
- Oh, wow.
- And plates.

40:24.330 --> 40:26.414
- Look at this,
and they're so cute.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.416
- Lisa, you are cute
as a dumpling.

40:28.427 --> 40:29.667
- Thanks, Sutton.

40:29.744 --> 40:30.760
- Are you putting that

40:30.837 --> 40:33.254
over your cute
little Flintstone outfit?

40:33.265 --> 40:34.547
[laughter]

40:34.624 --> 40:35.598
- Do you want to show--

40:35.675 --> 40:37.550
- So this is a skin,
a dumpling skin.

40:37.627 --> 40:40.103
So you fill it up...

40:40.180 --> 40:42.430
and then on the edge,
you're gonna pinch.

40:42.441 --> 40:46.109
- You seal it.
It just has to be sealed.

40:46.186 --> 40:49.562
- I think I may have done it.
- Yes. That's right.

40:49.639 --> 40:51.189
- That's really good.
- Yeah, that's really good.

40:51.265 --> 40:53.283
- You've been dumpling
making before.

40:53.359 --> 40:55.234
- This is so exciting.

40:55.311 --> 40:58.621
I can't wait to do this for PK.

40:58.698 --> 41:00.781
- It feels like a lot of work.
[laughs]

41:00.792 --> 41:03.293
- It is a lot of work.
- It's done. That's a dumpling.

41:03.369 --> 41:05.786
- There you go.
- I did it! I did a dumpling.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.797
- Yay.
- Now what?

41:07.874 --> 41:10.708
- So we're gonna pan-fry,
just for a few minutes,

41:10.785 --> 41:12.135
and then we'll put water in.

41:12.212 --> 41:13.586
- Uh-huh.

41:13.663 --> 41:16.797
- I need a facial.
Salons are not open.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.759
[chuckles]

41:19.835 --> 41:21.427
- Delicious.
- Here you guys go.

41:21.504 --> 41:23.146
- Little snackling.

41:23.223 --> 41:25.223
- Oh, my God, Lisa.
These look like your lips.

41:25.299 --> 41:27.892
Look.
- Ah!

41:27.969 --> 41:29.819
- It's Rinna Beauty.

41:33.658 --> 41:34.815
- Oh, my God.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.609
- Crystal,
this is so delicious.

41:36.686 --> 41:38.653
- I can't stop
eating these dumplings.

41:38.663 --> 41:42.240
Me and Kyle are just, like,
stuffing our faces.

41:42.316 --> 41:44.283
- [slurps]
Delicious.

41:44.360 --> 41:45.826
- These are beautifully cooked,
you guys.

41:45.837 --> 41:46.827
- They are.
- Look at these.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.496
- I know.
- Holy ma-loley.

41:48.507 --> 41:49.747
- It's so delicious. Wow.

41:49.824 --> 41:51.457
- My dumplings were
some of the tightest.

41:51.534 --> 41:52.625
Mm.

41:52.702 --> 41:53.793
- Okay.
I know you're not ready.

41:53.869 --> 41:55.294
- No.

41:55.371 --> 41:57.630
- But I would love for you
to meet my dating coach

41:57.707 --> 42:00.258
and just see
what the new world is like.

42:00.334 --> 42:02.176
You've been married
for a very long time.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.687
- Yeah. Two decades.
- Yes. That's a long time.

42:04.764 --> 42:07.431
- I'm not--
Mm, I don't know.

42:07.508 --> 42:09.517
I'm not doing it.
- You may.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.861
- No.
- I said the same thing, girl.

42:11.938 --> 42:15.481
- Probably just gonna have
to have a lot of anonymous sex.

42:15.558 --> 42:17.858
- Do you guys want
to get some dessert?

42:17.869 --> 42:19.869
- Yes!
- Outside?

42:19.946 --> 42:21.362
- Ladies, thank you so much.

42:21.373 --> 42:24.699
It was amazing, amazing,
and amazing.

42:24.709 --> 42:28.327
- You guys were awesome.
- Okay. We're gonna go pee.

42:28.404 --> 42:30.788
Dessert is ready.
- Okay. We're coming.

42:30.865 --> 42:32.832
- Ooh!
[shouts indistinctly]

42:32.908 --> 42:34.208
This looks amazing.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.502
I think my son Jax
would really love that.

42:36.579 --> 42:37.628
Do I just grab?

42:37.705 --> 42:38.838
- Just grab.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:38.914 --> 42:40.214
- Okay, he would...
- We just go for it.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.799
- Really appreciate that.

42:41.876 --> 42:43.843
- Oh, my God.
It is a lighter Erika.
