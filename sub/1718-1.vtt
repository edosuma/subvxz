01:16.578 --> 01:17.746
Easy.

01:22.292 --> 01:24.461
Saw some turkeys on the way here.

01:25.628 --> 01:28.006
Crossed right in front of me
like I wasn't even there.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.884
How rude of them.

01:30.967 --> 01:34.053
That's what happens when you spend
six days a week working in the mines.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.681
Stupid birds start to think
they own these woods.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.145
When's the tour leave?

01:42.687 --> 01:43.980
Couple hours.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.483
Well, let's go.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.579
Hey!

02:41.913 --> 02:43.915
- Hey. You're okay.
- Let go!

02:46.751 --> 02:48.378
You're okay. You're safe.

02:49.045 --> 02:51.089
It's okay. You're here with me.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.423
You're with me.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.057
Okay, okay.

03:01.558 --> 03:03.059
I'm sorry.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.274
We should...

03:11.734 --> 03:13.111
We should go.

03:33.756 --> 03:35.091
<i>Are you coming to the
train station?</i>

03:35.425 --> 03:38.177
I think you have enough people
saying goodbye without me there.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.430
Only a few I actually care about.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.142
It might be easier if I didn't.

03:46.603 --> 03:49.689
It's only a few weeks.
I'll be back before the snow melts.

03:49.772 --> 03:51.900
A lot can happen in a few weeks.

03:52.817 --> 03:54.235
Are we gonna do this again?

03:54.819 --> 03:56.195
Gale, it was an act.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.697
Yeah, it was a good one.

03:58.615 --> 04:02.035
I did what I had to do to survive.
If I didn't, I'd be dead.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.046
I had to do that.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.132
At least once.

04:44.661 --> 04:46.037
Haymitch!

04:50.375 --> 04:51.417
Haymitch!

04:57.924 --> 05:00.593
Haymitch, wake up. It's Tour Day.

05:01.928 --> 05:03.054
Haymitch.

05:18.403 --> 05:19.487
What are you doing?

05:19.570 --> 05:21.072
Cameras are gonna be here in an hour.

05:23.199 --> 05:26.160
If you wanted to be babied,
you should've asked Peeta.

05:26.244 --> 05:27.704
Asked me what?

05:27.954 --> 05:30.581
Asked you to wake me
without giving me pneumonia.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.919
You are a strangely
dislikeable person.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.215
But you do have your virtues.

05:40.216 --> 05:41.467
Would you like some bread, Katniss?

05:42.051 --> 05:44.053
No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you.

05:44.262 --> 05:45.304
You're welcome.

05:48.474 --> 05:51.769
You two have a lot of warming
up to do before show time.

05:51.978 --> 05:55.940
Which is in an hour,
so take a bath, Haymitch.

05:56.816 --> 05:58.234
I just did.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.744
Did you have a good walk, dear?

06:07.910 --> 06:10.288
- Walk? I was just out
- We have visitors.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.459
Miss Everdeen. This way, please.

06:29.682 --> 06:31.309
Such bravery.

06:32.769 --> 06:34.103
Such spirit.

06:34.771 --> 06:35.772
Such...

06:38.024 --> 06:39.484
Contempt.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.528
President Snow.

06:43.613 --> 06:45.073
What an honor.

06:45.156 --> 06:48.034
My dear, I think we can make this
so much simpler

06:48.117 --> 06:50.912
if we agree not to lie to each other.
What do you think?

06:50.995 --> 06:52.872
Yes, I think that would save time.

06:53.206 --> 06:54.332
Sit down, please.

07:04.050 --> 07:06.511
I have a problem, Miss Everdeen.

07:07.136 --> 07:11.641
A problem that began the moment you
revealed those poison berries in the arena.

07:11.724 --> 07:15.853
If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane,
had had any brains at all,

07:15.937 --> 07:18.731
he would have blown you to bits
then and there.

07:18.815 --> 07:20.233
But here you are.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.652
I expect you can guess where he is.

07:22.902 --> 07:24.487
Yes, I think so.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.615
After that fiasco,
there was nothing left to do

07:27.698 --> 07:30.201
but to let you play out
your little scenario.

07:31.327 --> 07:32.620
And you were very good.

07:32.703 --> 07:36.124
That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.

07:36.207 --> 07:38.126
Impressive. Truly.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.461
You convinced the
people in The Capitol.

07:41.087 --> 07:44.882
Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.

07:45.550 --> 07:48.427
I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,

07:48.511 --> 07:52.849
people viewed your little trick
with the berries as an act of defiance.

07:53.224 --> 07:55.101
Not as an act of love.

07:55.184 --> 08:01.190
And if a girl from District 12 of all places can
defy The Capitol and walk away unharmed,

08:01.274 --> 08:03.568
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?

08:03.651 --> 08:07.655
What is to prevent, say, an uprising?

08:08.030 --> 08:10.700
That can lead to revolution.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.995
And then, in a fraction of time,
the whole system collapses.

08:14.245 --> 08:18.124
It must be a fragile system, if it can be
brought down by just a few berries.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.876
Yes, it is, indeed.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.545
But not in the way you imagine it.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.130
How should I imagine?

08:24.213 --> 08:27.341
You should imagine thousands
upon thousands of your people dead.

08:27.717 --> 08:30.303
This town of yours reduced to ashes.

08:30.386 --> 08:31.470
Imagine it gone.

08:31.554 --> 08:32.679
Made radioactive.

08:32.763 --> 08:36.517
Buried under dirt as if it had
never existed, like District 13.

08:39.562 --> 08:42.440
You fought very hard in The Games,
Miss Everdeen.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.568
But they were games.

08:46.319 --> 08:48.362
Would you like to be in a real war?

08:48.446 --> 08:49.447
No.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.325
Good. Neither would I.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.660
Did your mother make these?

08:56.120 --> 08:57.121
Peeta.

08:58.331 --> 09:00.249
He's a lovely boy.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.418
Tell me.

09:03.586 --> 09:09.133
At what point did he realize the depth
of your indifference towards him?

09:09.592 --> 09:10.718
I'm not indifferent.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.094
Don't lie!

09:12.470 --> 09:13.679
You promised.

09:17.183 --> 09:19.435
Why don't you just kill me now?

09:23.105 --> 09:24.815
I don't want to kill you.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.944
I want us to be friends.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.321
But if not friends, then allies.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.697
What do I need to do?

09:31.781 --> 09:37.620
When you and Peeta are on tour, you need to smile.
You need to be grateful.

09:38.496 --> 09:43.125
But, above all, you need to be madly,
prepared-to-end-it-all in love.

09:43.209 --> 09:45.294
- You think you can manage that?
- Yes.

09:45.378 --> 09:46.462
Yes, what?

09:47.171 --> 09:49.131
- I'll convince them.
- No.

09:49.966 --> 09:51.300
Convince me.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.597
For you, Miss Everdeen.

10:03.479 --> 10:04.647
Do convince me.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.609
For the sake of your loved ones.

10:23.082 --> 10:24.709
Stop.

10:25.918 --> 10:26.961
Take it all in.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.756
This is sacred ground.

10:31.257 --> 10:34.510
History was made here.

10:37.972 --> 10:40.224
You'll get used to the smell.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.227
Hello!

10:44.520 --> 10:47.523
There she is. My greatest triumph!

10:47.606 --> 10:49.025
Our little superstar.

10:50.443 --> 10:51.777
Sweetie, we've missed you.

10:51.861 --> 10:53.487
What a cute little house.

10:53.571 --> 10:55.364
So quaint, isn't it?

10:55.448 --> 10:57.283
Of course, you've heard about Cinna?

10:57.366 --> 10:58.451
What happened to Cinna?

10:58.534 --> 11:02.788
Oh, dear, he's a fashion star.
You're his muse.

11:03.039 --> 11:05.041
Everyone in The Capitol's wearing him.
Everyone.

11:05.124 --> 11:06.876
- Everyone.
- Well, not everyone.

11:08.753 --> 11:09.920
Cinna!

11:11.130 --> 11:12.631
Katniss?

11:13.799 --> 11:15.885
Katniss, is this your sister?

11:16.093 --> 11:17.428
Oh, sweetie!

11:17.511 --> 11:18.471
Are you okay?

11:18.554 --> 11:19.889
Just adorable!

11:19.972 --> 11:21.807
- Yeah.
- Ready to work?

11:22.558 --> 11:24.560
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.397
Welcome!

11:30.733 --> 11:36.322
Last year, the 74th Hunger Games brought
us the greatest love story of our time.

11:37.073 --> 11:43.287
Two brave young people, against all odds,
chose to die rather than to lose each other.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.749
As a nation, we shared their agony.

11:47.249 --> 11:51.087
But we had so little time
to revel in their joy.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.838
It's time!

11:53.672 --> 11:56.425
She's done, she's lovely.
We must feed the monster.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.760
All right now.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.596
<i>Let's go to District 12
and find our star-crossed lovers!</i>

12:00.679 --> 12:01.931
You're excited. You're in love.

12:02.014 --> 12:05.434
Big smiles for the camera
in three, two, one.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.855
<i>There she is! Katniss Everdeen!
The Girl on Fire.</i>

12:16.695 --> 12:20.991
<i>And there he is!
Peeta Mellark! The Baker's Boy.</i>

12:29.834 --> 12:31.627
<i>Trouble in paradise.</i>

12:32.294 --> 12:33.879
<i>I hope they're all right.</i>

12:38.634 --> 12:41.345
<i>Anyone at home?
Should we come back later?</i>

12:42.471 --> 12:43.973
<i>Sorry, Caesar.</i>

12:44.056 --> 12:46.892
Please. It's all right.
It's your day.

12:46.976 --> 12:49.186
<i>It's your day. So how's it going?</i>

12:50.312 --> 12:51.397
We're good.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.734
<i>That's it? That's all we get?
"We're good‚Äù?</i>

12:55.818 --> 12:59.280
<i>So taciturn all of a sudden.
Peeta, give me some details!</i>

13:02.158 --> 13:05.327
Yeah, things are great here in 12.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.999
Thanks to the generosity of The
Capitol, we've never been closer.

13:10.416 --> 13:12.501
Twenty-five yards, to be exact.

13:13.752 --> 13:14.753
<i>Fantastic!</i>

13:14.837 --> 13:18.257
We'll be checking in with both of you
throughout the Victory Tour.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.343
<i>Thank you so much,
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!</i>

13:23.512 --> 13:25.097
Wonderful!

13:25.181 --> 13:28.017
Everybody in motion.
We are out of here in 10.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.103
- That was nice acting.
- You, too.

13:31.604 --> 13:33.522
Almost thought that kiss was real.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.067
Come along, children,
we are on a schedule.

13:37.193 --> 13:38.819
The train awaits!

13:41.697 --> 13:45.117
<i>Fabulous food, fabulous wine,
the massages, spa treatments.</i>

13:45.201 --> 13:48.537
I told them nothing but the
best for my two Victors.

13:48.621 --> 13:50.456
It all needs to be...

13:50.706 --> 13:51.749
Fabulous?

13:51.874 --> 13:52.875
Exactly.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.837
Now, the schedule is a bit of a bear.
12 days, 12 districts.

13:56.921 --> 13:59.256
But it's mostly
parties, celebrations,

13:59.340 --> 14:02.468
adoring fans to greet you
at every stop along the way,

14:02.551 --> 14:04.720
and then we wrap it
up in The Capitol.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.224
All you need to do is give a few
speeches, wave to the crowds,

14:08.307 --> 14:10.476
and enjoy your time in the spotlight.

14:10.559 --> 14:11.727
You've earned it.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.312
What did you say?

14:13.604 --> 14:14.813
Katniss.

14:14.897 --> 14:19.276
I said, "Enjoy it, Katniss,
you've earned it."

14:19.735 --> 14:21.403
By killing people-

14:24.073 --> 14:25.407
Young lady...

14:46.679 --> 14:50.266
I'm really not in the mood for a lecture.
I'll apologize to Effie later.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.145
I thought you were Haymitch.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.398
You don't have to
apologize to anybody.

14:57.856 --> 14:58.857
Including me.

15:00.442 --> 15:04.405
I know it's not fair of me to hold
you to things you said in The Games.

15:05.364 --> 15:08.534
You saved us. I know that.

15:10.327 --> 15:15.249
But I can't go on acting for the cameras, and
then just ignoring each other in real life.

15:15.958 --> 15:20.838
So if you can stop looking at me like I'm
wounded, then I can quit acting like it.

15:22.006 --> 15:26.093
And then maybe
we have a shot at being friends.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.303
I've never been very good at friends.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.141
For starters, it does help
when you know the person.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.645
I hardly know anything about you except
that you're stubborn and good with a bow.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.522
That about sums me up.

15:38.731 --> 15:41.191
No, there's more than that,
you just don't want to tell me.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.901
It's like I said, I'm...

15:42.985 --> 15:44.570
See, Katniss, the way
the whole friend thing works

15:44.653 --> 15:48.198
is you have to tell each
other the deep stuff.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.825
- The deep stuff?
- Yeah.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.076
Like what?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.244
Like...

15:53.328 --> 15:54.371
What's your favorite color?

15:54.455 --> 15:55.789
Well, now you've
stepped over the line.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.668
Seriously, though, what is it?

16:02.171 --> 16:03.172
Green.

16:04.173 --> 16:05.174
What's yours?

16:05.549 --> 16:06.550
Orange.

16:06.925 --> 16:10.512
- Like Effie's hair?
- No. Not that orange.

16:10.596 --> 16:13.849
More like a sunset kind of orange.

16:27.529 --> 16:28.614
Did you see that?

16:29.531 --> 16:30.532
What?

16:54.139 --> 16:55.641
Well, I never.

16:57.101 --> 16:58.894
This is not very festive.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.648
The mayor will make
some introductory remarks.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.817
And then you just have
to say a few words.

17:04.900 --> 17:09.029
It's customary, of course, to give a brief
eulogy to the district's fallen Tributes.

17:09.113 --> 17:12.491
For 11, that's Thresh and Rue.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.910
Here are the speeches.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.415
I can do the talking if you want.

17:20.499 --> 17:21.500
Thank you.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.667
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

17:22.751 --> 17:25.712
the Victors of the 74th Hunger Games.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.758
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!

17:30.008 --> 17:33.178
Smile, smile, smile, smile.
Stand up straight. You're on camera.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.688
Thank you.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.942
We're honored to be
here with you today.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.487
And to be with the families
of your fallen Tributes.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.291
He put down the cards.

18:02.374 --> 18:05.335
<i>- Though they fought and lived with honor...
- Why do I bother?</i>

18:05.460 --> 18:07.754
<i>...and dignity until the end,</i>

18:07.921 --> 18:10.215
both Thresh and Rue

18:11.633 --> 18:13.135
were so young.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.806
But our lives aren't just
measured in years.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.685
They're measured in the lives
of people we touch around us.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.397
For myself,

18:26.815 --> 18:27.983
for Katniss,

18:31.987 --> 18:36.825
we know that without Rue and without
Thresh, we wouldn't be standing here today.

18:37.451 --> 18:42.539
So in recognition of that, knowing that
it in no way can make up for your loss,

18:43.874 --> 18:48.128
we'd like to donate one month of our
winnings to the families of the Tributes,

18:48.212 --> 18:50.339
every year, for the rest of our lives.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.299
Shit.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.551
Can he do that?

18:55.677 --> 18:57.846
He can't. But he did.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.891
Why doesn't he just
stick to the cards?

19:01.558 --> 19:02.559
Thank you.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.826
I just wanted to say that
I didn't know Thresh.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.536
I only spoke to him once.

19:22.037 --> 19:25.207
He could have killed me,
but instead he showed me mercy.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.835
That's a debt I'll never
be able to repay.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.549
I did know Rue.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.387
She wasn't just my ally,
she was my friend.

19:41.348 --> 19:46.395
I see her in the flowers
that grow in the meadow by my house.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.564
I hear her in a Mockingjay song.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.403
I see her in my sister Prim.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.241
She was too young,

20:01.243 --> 20:02.744
too gentle.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.582
And I couldn't save her.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.087
I'm sorry.

20:37.779 --> 20:38.947
No! No!

20:39.448 --> 20:40.782
Wait! Wait!

20:40.991 --> 20:42.909
No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

20:42.993 --> 20:45.662
No! Let me go!
Please leave him alone!

20:45.746 --> 20:46.747
No!

20:47.581 --> 20:48.582
No!

20:48.957 --> 20:50.000
No!

20:52.836 --> 20:54.796
You! No, no, no!

20:54.963 --> 20:56.798
Come here! Stop it!

20:56.965 --> 20:58.175
Stop it! Stop!

20:58.425 --> 20:59.426
What did I do?

20:59.634 --> 21:00.635
Come on.

21:01.803 --> 21:02.804
Shut up.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.265
In all my years, I've never seen...

21:10.979 --> 21:12.939
You two have a very simple task.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.358
I never meant for anyone to get killed.
He has to know that.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.943
What are you talking about?
Who has to know what?

21:17.027 --> 21:18.987
Snow. He came to see me.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.156
He's worried about rebellion
in the districts.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.742
He thinks that
they don't believe our love story.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.328
So he wants you to
make them believe it?

21:26.453 --> 21:27.662
- To calm things down.
- You know, Katniss,

21:27.746 --> 21:29.206
you shoulda told me that
before I went out there,

21:29.289 --> 21:30.415
and tried to give these
people the money.

21:30.499 --> 21:33.418
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.
He threatened to kill my family.

21:33.502 --> 21:35.170
Well, I have family, too.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.630
Okay? People that I need to protect.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.924
What about them? Who protects them?

21:41.343 --> 21:43.011
Katniss, what were you thinking?

21:43.095 --> 21:44.387
I was thinking about Rue.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.514
Haymitch, please...

21:45.639 --> 21:47.349
Please, just help me
get through this trip.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.101
Please, just help us
get through this.

21:49.184 --> 21:51.061
This trip? Girl, wake up.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.271
This trip doesn't end
when you get back home.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.649
You never get off this train.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.985
You two are mentors now.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.780
That means that every year,
they're gonna drag you out,

22:01.863 --> 22:04.783
and broadcast the details
of your romance.

22:04.866 --> 22:08.120
Every year, your private
life becomes theirs.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.664
From now on, your job
is to be a distraction.

22:10.872 --> 22:13.625
So people forget what
the real problems are.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.627
- So what do we do?
- You're gonna smile.

22:16.044 --> 22:19.005
You're gonna read the cards
that Effie gives you.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.883
And you're gonna live
happily ever after.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.552
Think you can do that?

22:26.596 --> 22:27.597
Yeah?

22:28.390 --> 22:29.558
Come here.

22:36.606 --> 22:39.776
You're gonna be okay. I promise.

22:41.570 --> 22:44.364
<i>Katniss and I
want to share with you our victory.</i>

22:44.447 --> 22:47.284
And our gratitude to The Capitol
for bringing us together.

22:47.617 --> 22:51.371
It was the bond of love,
forged in the crucible of The Games

22:51.454 --> 22:53.081
<i>that was our greatest prize.</i>

22:53.165 --> 22:57.294
<i>For it is love and true love that
allows us all to bear our hardships.</i>

22:57.502 --> 23:02.048
<i>That mends the heart and banishes
loneliness and gives meaning to our lives.</i>

23:03.091 --> 23:06.636
We also want to share with you
the sorrows of your losses.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.346
The Tributes of this...

23:16.938 --> 23:20.150
The Tributes of this district
were brave and noble warriors.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.986
They brought honor to their families
and pride to their people.

23:23.069 --> 23:28.909
<i>We are all of us united, both victors and
vanquished, in serving a common purpose.</i>

23:31.494 --> 23:32.495
Thank you.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.790
One day, I'm gonna volunteer.
Just like you did.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.717
It was just a dream. I'm sorry.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.636
It's okay. I get 'em, too.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.513
Goodnight.

23:50.889 --> 23:51.890
Peeta.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.268
Will you stay with me?

23:56.478 --> 23:57.479
Yeah.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.570
Always.

24:12.327 --> 24:17.249
<i>We are all of us united,
both victors and vanquished,</i>

24:17.332 --> 24:19.542
<i>in serving a common purpose.</i>

24:19.626 --> 24:22.921
- The power and glory of The Capitol.
- Put down the cards!

24:23.004 --> 24:24.422
Tell us what you really think!

24:24.506 --> 24:29.261
Panem today. Panem tomorrow.
Panem forever.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.608
Your hair looks lovely, darling.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.695
When did you start
wearing it like that?

24:47.904 --> 24:50.782
Everyone at school wears
it like this now, Grandpa.

24:54.703 --> 24:56.788
Snow is watching us.

24:56.871 --> 25:01.293
If he wants you to pacify the districts,
I promise you, he's not happy.

25:01.376 --> 25:05.755
Instead of being in love, you two sound like
you're reciting from a drilling manual.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.841
You try reading that stuff
that Effie writes us.

25:07.924 --> 25:11.136
Tell that to President Snow
when you see him two days from now.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.637
I'm open to suggestions.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.431
We could get married.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.766
That's not helping.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.226
I'm serious.

25:19.227 --> 25:22.939
If, like you said, we're on this train
forever, it's gonna happen eventually.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.065
Why not now?

25:26.901 --> 25:29.738
It does make a statement.
I'll give you that.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.742
Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

25:38.830 --> 25:39.998
<i>Just when you thought things</i>

25:40.081 --> 25:43.835
<i>couldn't get more exciting going
into a very special Quarter Quell,</i>

25:43.918 --> 25:47.047
our two lethal lovers,
my favorite expression,

25:48.256 --> 25:49.758
from District 12

25:50.008 --> 25:53.261
have surprised us
with a new twist in their love affair.

25:53.345 --> 25:54.804
Let's take a look.

25:59.351 --> 26:03.521
A fairy tale ending
for two star-crossed lovers.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.565
<i>That's beautiful. Beautiful.</i>

26:05.774 --> 26:07.609
<i>And then tonight,</i>

26:07.859 --> 26:13.698
<i>the tour that began in the hollows
of District 12 will end where?</i>

26:13.907 --> 26:15.700
The Presidential Palace.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.911
The party of the year.

26:18.286 --> 26:21.915
Eyes bright. Chins up. Smiles on.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.459
I'm talking to you, Katniss.

26:25.126 --> 26:28.380
Now, there'll be photographers.
Interviews.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.550
Everyone will be here
to celebrate you.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.843
My Victors.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.225
Breathe it all in, children.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.812
This is all for you.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.021
It's cozy.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.815
Attitude.

26:50.402 --> 26:51.486
Come, come.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.988
Come along.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.325
Excuse us, excuse us.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.000
Come, come.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.132
Hold hands.

27:16.261 --> 27:18.346
And the library. All mahogany.

27:18.596 --> 27:19.806
Hello, hello!

27:19.889 --> 27:21.724
Not yet, not yet. No, no, no.

27:22.016 --> 27:23.143
Curtains!

27:23.852 --> 27:25.812
Everybody who's anybody is here.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.814
And they all want to meet you.

27:29.566 --> 27:31.734
Flavius! Octavia!

27:38.408 --> 27:40.743
Try one of these. They are divine.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.370
No, I can't eat another thing.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.205
- Here.
- What's this?

27:44.539 --> 27:45.957
It's for when you're full.

27:47.292 --> 27:48.877
It makes you sick.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.670
So you can go on eating.

27:50.753 --> 27:52.755
How else could you taste everything?

27:54.674 --> 27:56.342
I think it's time for a dance.

27:57.552 --> 27:58.678
Katniss?

28:09.898 --> 28:11.566
People are starving in 12.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.903
Here, they're just throwing it up
to stuff more in.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.154
Katniss? Peeta.

28:16.237 --> 28:21.075
This is Plutarch Heavensbee.
Head Gamemaker.

28:21.576 --> 28:23.286
Successor to Seneca Crane.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.996
That's a tough act to follow.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.373
Peeta!

28:29.584 --> 28:30.752
May I?

28:31.085 --> 28:32.086
Please.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.014
So how do you like the party?

28:43.097 --> 28:44.724
It's a little overwhelming.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.352
It's appalling-

28:48.728 --> 28:51.773
Still, if you abandon your
moral judgment, it can be fun.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.568
So are you having fun?

28:55.944 --> 28:58.530
I'm the Head Gamemaker. Fun is my job.

28:58.863 --> 29:01.032
Thought that was what happened
to Seneca Crane.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.450
Too much fun.

29:03.535 --> 29:07.413
Seneca decided to quit breathing.

29:07.872 --> 29:09.040
Decided.

29:09.123 --> 29:11.334
It was that or poison berries.

29:12.126 --> 29:15.630
Being Head Gamemaker has never been
the most secure job in the world.

29:16.256 --> 29:17.715
Then why are you here?

29:18.800 --> 29:21.261
Same reason as you. I volunteered.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.805
Why?

29:24.472 --> 29:25.807
Ambition.

29:27.642 --> 29:30.228
The chance to
make The Games mean something.

29:31.479 --> 29:33.314
The Games don't mean anything.

29:34.148 --> 29:35.817
They only mean to scare us.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.945
Well, maybe it was you
who inspired me to come back.

29:44.117 --> 29:45.827
The Presidential welcome.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.162
I'm sure we'll meet again.

29:48.496 --> 29:51.791
Katniss, come. The President awaits.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.920
You think we convinced him?

29:56.004 --> 29:57.797
I'm not sure what else we can do.

30:12.895 --> 30:17.317
Tonight, on this, the
last day of their tour,

30:18.192 --> 30:20.778
I want to welcome our two Victors.

30:21.154 --> 30:25.658
Two young people who embody our ideals

30:25.742 --> 30:28.369
of strength and valor.

30:30.496 --> 30:34.959
And I, personally, want
to congratulate them

30:35.710 --> 30:38.630
on the announcement
of their engagement.

30:42.216 --> 30:44.636
Your love has inspired us.

30:45.720 --> 30:49.557
And I know it will go on inspiring us

30:50.475 --> 30:51.893
every day

30:52.644 --> 30:54.896
for as long as you may live.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.054
<i>Look at them.</i>

32:10.138 --> 32:12.306
She's not who they think she is.

32:12.432 --> 32:13.641
She's not a leader.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.811
She just wants to save her own skin.
It's as simple as that.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.479
I think that's true.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.482
But she's become
a beacon of hope for the rebellion.

32:22.233 --> 32:23.985
And she has to be eliminated.

32:24.277 --> 32:26.988
I agree she should die.
But in the right way.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.240
At the right time.

32:29.323 --> 32:32.285
It's moves and countermoves.
That's all we gotta look at.

32:32.785 --> 32:35.663
Katniss Everdeen is a symbol.
Their Mockingjay.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.248
They think she's one of them.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.584
We need to show that she's one of us.

32:40.084 --> 32:42.253
We don't need to destroy her.
Just the image.

32:42.336 --> 32:43.713
Then we let the people do the rest.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.256
What do you propose?

32:45.339 --> 32:48.301
Shut down the black markets.
Take away what little they have.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.762
Then double the amount of
floggings and executions.

32:50.845 --> 32:54.348
Put them on TV. Broadcast them live.

32:55.266 --> 32:57.643
Sow fear. More fear.

32:57.727 --> 33:00.855
It won't work. Fear does not work
as long as they have hope.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.608
And Katniss Everdeen
is giving them hope.

33:03.691 --> 33:04.901
She's engaged.

33:05.276 --> 33:06.652
Make everything about that.

33:06.736 --> 33:09.238
What kind of dress is she gonna wear?
Floggings.

33:09.322 --> 33:11.616
What's the cake gonna look like?
Executions.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.618
Who's gonna be there? Fear.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.287
Blanket coverage.
Shove it in their faces.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.664
Show them that she is one of us now.

33:19.290 --> 33:22.668
They're gonna hate her so much
they might just kill her for you.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.297
Brilliant.

33:38.351 --> 33:39.393
When did you...

33:45.817 --> 33:47.318
We need to talk.

33:52.365 --> 33:53.783
Where are we gonna run away?

33:53.866 --> 33:55.827
Into the woods.
Like we always talked about.

33:55.910 --> 33:58.788
If we leave right now, we can be
far away from here by tonight.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.122
Yeah, who's "we"?

34:00.331 --> 34:01.666
You, me and your fianc√©?

34:02.333 --> 34:04.252
It's not just me and Peeta any more.

34:06.254 --> 34:07.505
Snow threatened to have you killed.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.550
Anyone else?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.635
Well, he didn't exactly
give me a copy of the list

34:12.717 --> 34:14.929
but a good guess,
it includes both of our families.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.639
Unless what?
You and Peeta get married?

34:16.722 --> 34:18.266
Unless nothing now.

34:18.599 --> 34:19.851
Gale, we can do it.

34:20.059 --> 34:23.062
You said yourself that we could do it
the morning of the Reaping.

34:24.438 --> 34:25.606
What do you say now?

34:25.773 --> 34:26.899
Do you love me?

34:28.192 --> 34:30.152
Gale, you know how I feel about you.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.822
But I can't think about anyone
that way right now.

34:32.905 --> 34:35.783
The only thing that I can think about
every day, every waking moment

34:35.908 --> 34:37.827
since the Reaping, is how afraid I am.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.579
There's no room for anything else.

34:40.413 --> 34:42.081
But maybe, if we got away from here,

34:42.164 --> 34:44.667
if we went somewhere safe,
it could be different.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.918
I could be different.

34:46.002 --> 34:47.335
You think maybe the
President's bluffing?

34:47.420 --> 34:48.462
He's not bluffing.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.049
Not with what's going
on in the districts.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.175
What do you mean?

34:55.011 --> 34:56.219
What did you see?

34:56.971 --> 35:00.224
There were people fighting
in the streets, and fires,

35:00.308 --> 35:03.477
and Peacekeepers were gunning
them down, but the people were...

35:03.853 --> 35:05.187
What? The people were what?

35:05.271 --> 35:06.564
They were fighting back.

35:07.982 --> 35:09.275
It's happening-

35:10.318 --> 35:11.402
It's finally happening.

35:11.485 --> 35:15.740
I should've just eaten the berries in the
arena and died like I was supposed to.

35:15.823 --> 35:18.159
Then everything would be back to normal
and everyone would be safe.

35:18.242 --> 35:19.785
Safe for what?

35:20.119 --> 35:23.748
To starve? Work like slaves?
Send their kids to the Reaping?

35:23.998 --> 35:26.751
You haven't hurt people, Katniss.
You've given them an opportunity.

35:26.834 --> 35:29.170
They just have to be
brave enough to take it.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.298
There's already talk in the mines.
People wanna fight.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.550
We have to go, Gale,
before they kill us.

35:34.634 --> 35:36.010
They Will kill us.

35:36.093 --> 35:38.304
What about the other families?

35:38.679 --> 35:41.140
The ones who stay.
What happens to them?

35:41.432 --> 35:45.269
- People are looking to you, Katniss.
- I don't want anyone looking to me.

35:45.353 --> 35:46.479
I can't help them.

35:57.490 --> 35:58.866
You do what you want.

35:59.659 --> 36:00.826
I'm staying here.

36:20.429 --> 36:23.641
Commander Thread,
welcome to District 12.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.108
Let's get to work.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.508
- Let's go! Keep moving!
- Stay close!

36:58.009 --> 36:59.176
<i>Find and clear.</i>

36:59.301 --> 37:00.928
<i>Burn all contraband.</i>

37:10.187 --> 37:11.522
Let me go!

37:37.798 --> 37:38.799
Ripper!

37:38.966 --> 37:39.967
My eye!

37:40.092 --> 37:41.135
I'm gonna get you out of here.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.303
No!

37:43.429 --> 37:44.597
Leave her be! Stop!

37:47.183 --> 37:48.184
No!

37:55.983 --> 37:57.610
In the square.

38:04.992 --> 38:06.160
Here.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.583
Yeah, hold that on there.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.020
No!

38:34.355 --> 38:35.815
No! No! Stop!

38:41.362 --> 38:42.488
Katniss!

38:43.864 --> 38:44.949
It's okay.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.535
Just go. It's okay.

38:53.707 --> 38:54.834
Move.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.003
You want another?

38:58.212 --> 38:59.338
Go ahead.

39:01.465 --> 39:03.634
- Get out of my way!
- No, you don't want to shoot her.

39:03.717 --> 39:05.052
How about I shoot both of you?

39:05.261 --> 39:07.221
Look, Commander, you're new here.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.890
Trust me, I'm trying to help you.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.183
I'm Haymitch.

39:11.392 --> 39:14.562
You recognize her? Katniss Everdeen.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.605
Darling of The Capitol.

39:19.191 --> 39:20.818
She interfered with a Peacekeeper.

39:20.901 --> 39:22.403
I never said she was smart.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.490
Look, you already got
a couple of lashes in, right?

39:26.574 --> 39:28.576
That's not good enough.
She's an agitator.

39:29.243 --> 39:31.745
- Easy, easy.
- Look...

39:31.912 --> 39:33.581
You're sure Snow
wants three dead Victors here?

39:33.664 --> 39:35.082
Because that's what we're looking at.

39:35.249 --> 39:39.086
It's bad enough that you marked up her
face on the eve of the big wedding.

39:39.253 --> 39:42.089
Let it go. And we will, too.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.100
All right.

39:56.687 --> 39:57.771
Okay.

39:59.773 --> 40:03.027
But next time, it's the firing squad.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.446
Excellent idea.

40:05.696 --> 40:07.406
I don't care who she is.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.619
Clear the square!

40:13.370 --> 40:15.414
You're all under curfew.

40:17.124 --> 40:22.004
Anyone out after dark
will be shot on sight.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.426
Get 'em outta here.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.141
It's Gale.

40:34.225 --> 40:35.643
Get him here.

40:38.604 --> 40:39.563
Here we go.

40:39.647 --> 40:42.107
Really easy. Up, UP-

40:43.317 --> 40:44.318
Okay.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.403
Okay. Thanks.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.072
New Head Peacekeeper.

40:48.155 --> 40:49.615
Not entirely peaceful.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.492
Missed your eye.
Doesn't need stitches.

40:51.575 --> 40:55.037
- Make a snow coat.
- Peeta, get the snow. I'll grind the herbs.

40:57.873 --> 40:58.874
What is that? That's hurting him.

40:58.958 --> 40:59.959
He needs morphling.

41:03.462 --> 41:04.505
It's okay.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.143
Mom. No. I'll do it.

41:19.019 --> 41:20.521
Oh, God.

41:23.941 --> 41:24.942
Hold him, please.

41:30.698 --> 41:31.865
That's better.

42:04.898 --> 42:07.651
- Hey, Catnip.
- Hey.

42:08.152 --> 42:10.237
Thought you'd be gone by now.

42:10.404 --> 42:12.239
I'm not going anywhere.

42:13.240 --> 42:16.410
I'm gonna stay right here.
Cause all kinds of trouble.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.581
Me, too.

42:45.064 --> 42:46.106
Hey.

42:49.568 --> 42:52.529
You wanna get some rest?
I can look after him for a while.

42:56.116 --> 42:58.786
I'm gonna go get him more snow.

43:27.731 --> 43:28.816
Hey.

43:29.608 --> 43:30.651
How's your eye?

43:31.318 --> 43:33.570
It's not my eye that's bothering me.

43:35.155 --> 43:38.158
How can we live like this?
How can anybody live like this?

43:38.325 --> 43:40.661
It's not living, but...

43:42.788 --> 43:45.958
Since the last Games,
something is different.

43:46.417 --> 43:47.501
I can see it.

43:49.336 --> 43:50.754
What can you see?

43:52.589 --> 43:53.632
Hope.

43:56.635 --> 44:00.180
You understand that whatever I do
comes back to you and Mom.

44:00.848 --> 44:02.433
I don't want you to get hurt.

44:03.142 --> 44:06.437
You don't have to protect me. Or Mom.

44:08.522 --> 44:09.940
We're with you.

44:19.199 --> 44:20.325
I love you.

44:21.034 --> 44:22.327
I love you, too.

44:23.829 --> 44:25.664
The broadcast cut out here.

44:26.623 --> 44:28.834
Before any of the
excitement happened.

44:29.710 --> 44:32.296
- How many people saw it?
- Hard to say.

44:32.379 --> 44:35.466
There was a five second delay,
but it happened fast.

44:35.549 --> 44:41.722
If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen,
then I will have to terminate her.

44:41.889 --> 44:43.182
I understand that.

44:43.265 --> 44:44.641
And not just her.

44:48.562 --> 44:51.482
Her entire species has
to be eliminated.

44:51.607 --> 44:52.608
Her species, sir?

44:53.400 --> 44:54.902
The other Victors.

44:55.319 --> 44:58.405
Now, because of her,
they all pose a threat.

44:59.072 --> 45:03.368
Because of her,
they all think they're invincible.

45:04.411 --> 45:10.334
Whatever game you think you're playing,
those out there are not playing it with you.

45:12.085 --> 45:14.129
There's a way we can still win.

45:16.840 --> 45:19.843
It's what we Gamemakers
like to call "a wrinkle."

45:27.434 --> 45:29.436
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:29.603 --> 45:34.358
this is the 75th year
of The Hunger Games.

45:35.442 --> 45:38.612
<i>And it was written
in the charter of The Games</i>

45:38.820 --> 45:42.741
<i>that every 25 years,
there would be a Quarter Quell</i>

45:43.575 --> 45:47.037
<i>to keep fresh for each new generation</i>

45:47.246 --> 45:53.085
<i>the memory of those who died
in the uprising against The Capitol.</i>

45:53.293 --> 45:59.299
<i>Each Quarter Quell is distinguished
by Games of a special significance.</i>

45:59.550 --> 46:01.718
<i>And now on this the</i>

46:01.927 --> 46:05.597
75th anniversary of
our defeat of the rebellion,

46:06.473 --> 46:09.309
we celebrate the 3rd Quarter Quell

46:11.812 --> 46:16.316
as a reminder that even the strongest

46:17.401 --> 46:21.238
<i>cannot overcome the power of The Capitol.</i>

46:21.989 --> 46:26.076
<i>On this, the 3rd Quarter Quell Games,</i>

46:27.452 --> 46:30.330
<i>the male and female Tributes</i>

46:30.831 --> 46:37.004
<i>are to be reaped from the existing pool
of Victors in each district.</i>

46:38.422 --> 46:39.423
No!

46:40.465 --> 46:41.550
Who does he mean?

46:41.633 --> 46:44.094
<i>Victors shall present themselves
on Reaping Day</i>

46:45.345 --> 46:47.514
-regardless of age...
- Katniss...

46:47.598 --> 46:49.391
<i>...state of health</i>

46:49.474 --> 46:50.767
<i>or situation</i>

47:02.821 --> 47:03.822
No.

47:19.338 --> 47:20.547
Peeta.

47:29.556 --> 47:30.682
There she is.

47:31.058 --> 47:32.476
Finally did the math?

47:32.684 --> 47:34.895
And you've come to, what?

47:35.145 --> 47:37.481
Ask me to... Die?

47:38.440 --> 47:40.108
I'm here to drink.

47:41.485 --> 47:43.028
Finally, something I
can help you with.

47:45.739 --> 47:50.952
What's it say that Peeta was here
45 minutes ago begging to save your life

47:51.036 --> 47:52.371
and you only just now show up?

47:52.454 --> 47:53.830
It means we have to save him.

47:53.914 --> 47:57.751
You could live 100 lifetimes
and never deserve that boy.

47:57.918 --> 48:01.505
Come on, Haymitch.
Nobody decent ever wins The Games.

48:01.588 --> 48:03.924
Nobody ever wins The Games. Period.

48:06.259 --> 48:08.053
There are survivors.

48:09.179 --> 48:10.514
There's no winners.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.557
Peeta has to survive.

48:14.267 --> 48:16.853
We have to do whatever
it takes to save him.

48:19.231 --> 48:20.690
All right, if...

48:22.776 --> 48:26.113
If they call his name,
I'll volunteer in his place.

48:26.279 --> 48:27.906
Haymitch, thank you.

48:28.115 --> 48:32.869
But they call my name and Peeta
volunteers, there's nothing I can do.

48:34.287 --> 48:37.958
You can help him in the arena.
Like you did for me.

48:39.251 --> 48:41.628
I think these Games are
gonna be different.

48:42.629 --> 48:45.132
I don't care. Do whatever you can.

48:46.258 --> 48:48.051
Peeta lives. Not me.

48:49.803 --> 48:51.138
Promise me.

48:54.474 --> 48:55.767
Okay.

49:01.565 --> 49:03.900
We should've gone when you said.

49:56.286 --> 49:57.496
<i>Welcome.</i>

49:57.704 --> 49:58.830
Welcome.

49:59.372 --> 50:03.543
As we celebrate the 75th anniversary

50:04.211 --> 50:06.505
and 3rd Quarter Quell

50:07.339 --> 50:09.716
of The Hunger Games.

50:09.966 --> 50:13.720
As always, ladies first.

50:29.319 --> 50:33.573
The female Tribute from District 12,

50:35.408 --> 50:36.910
Katniss Everdeen.

50:48.713 --> 50:50.048
Wonderful.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.093
And now for the men.

51:04.688 --> 51:07.440
The male Tribute from District 12.

51:08.942 --> 51:10.986
Haymitch Abernathy.

51:11.069 --> 51:13.321
- I volunteer as Tribute.
- I can't let you do that.

51:13.405 --> 51:14.614
You can't stop me.

51:14.698 --> 51:16.241
- Peeta.
- Let go.

51:21.746 --> 51:22.956
Very well.

51:23.623 --> 51:26.793
The Tributes from District 12.

51:27.210 --> 51:29.379
Katniss Everdeen

51:30.463 --> 51:32.257
and Peeta Mellark.

51:36.553 --> 51:39.222
Well, all that remains is...

51:53.612 --> 51:55.405
Oh, no. But, but, but...

51:56.323 --> 51:57.449
Katniss!

51:57.657 --> 51:59.326
- I get to say goodbye.
- Katniss!

51:59.409 --> 52:02.329
- New plan. Straight to the train.
- No, I have to say goodbye.

52:02.412 --> 52:03.413
Katniss!

52:03.580 --> 52:04.623
No.

52:06.458 --> 52:07.459
Good bye!

52:21.514 --> 52:22.974
All right.

52:23.600 --> 52:26.895
Before we begin, I've had a thought.

52:26.978 --> 52:28.146
You don't say?

52:29.648 --> 52:32.525
Katniss has her gold Mockingjay pin.

52:33.193 --> 52:34.694
I have my hair.

52:35.779 --> 52:39.366
I'm going to get you two boys
something gold.

52:42.202 --> 52:43.787
Why is that?

52:44.037 --> 52:45.288
A token.

52:45.664 --> 52:47.499
Show them we are a team.

52:48.124 --> 52:49.668
And they can't just...

52:50.877 --> 52:51.878
Thank you.

53:00.011 --> 53:02.138
All right. Now...

53:04.683 --> 53:07.852
Everything will be different,
because it's a Quarter Quell.

53:08.395 --> 53:11.189
<i>The Capitol has spared no expense.</i>

53:11.398 --> 53:12.732
<i>A new training center.</i>

53:12.857 --> 53:14.234
<i>New Tribute living quarters.</i>

53:14.317 --> 53:17.404
<i>And of course, a very special arena.</i>

53:17.696 --> 53:20.573
<i>But this year you'll be facing other Victors.
Capitol favorites.</i>

53:20.990 --> 53:22.367
<i>Smart, cunning, skilled.</i>

53:23.076 --> 53:24.911
<i>And they all know one another.</i>

53:25.161 --> 53:27.122
<i>You two are the outsiders.</i>

53:27.205 --> 53:30.750
I want you guys to forget everything
you think you know about The Games.

53:31.084 --> 53:33.044
Last year was child's play.

53:33.336 --> 53:37.132
This year, you're dealing
with all experienced killers.

53:37.215 --> 53:39.676
All right. What does
that mean for us?

53:40.093 --> 53:42.345
That means you're gonna have
to have some allies.

53:43.012 --> 53:46.349
- Okay. I think that if...
- You're not the problem.

53:46.891 --> 53:47.892
No.

53:48.768 --> 53:51.271
Look, you're starting
at a disadvantage.

53:51.354 --> 53:53.648
Most of these people
have been friends for years.

53:53.732 --> 53:55.525
That just puts us higher
on their kill list.

53:56.025 --> 53:58.737
Do it your own way,
but I know these people.

53:58.945 --> 54:03.116
You go it alone, their first move
is gonna be to hunt you down.

54:03.575 --> 54:04.868
Both of you.

54:05.410 --> 54:06.786
Katniss, come on.

54:11.791 --> 54:14.377
How could any of us
even trust each other?

54:14.461 --> 54:18.089
It's not about trust.
It's about staying alive.

54:19.257 --> 54:22.552
Cashmere and Gloss.
Brother and sister. District 1.

54:22.635 --> 54:25.305
They won back-to-back Games.
Capitol favorites.

54:25.388 --> 54:28.266
Lots of sponsors.
They will be lethal.

54:29.309 --> 54:32.479
And the other half of the Career Pack,
Brutus and Enobaria.

54:32.562 --> 54:33.563
What's with her teeth?

54:33.646 --> 54:37.066
She had them filed into fangs
so she could rip people's throats out.

54:37.150 --> 54:38.401
She's committed. I'll give her that.

54:38.485 --> 54:41.821
Wiress and Beetee.
Not fighters, but brilliant.

54:42.113 --> 54:44.491
And weird. Real tech-savvy.

54:44.657 --> 54:47.786
He won his Games by
electrocuting six Tributes at once.

54:47.952 --> 54:50.413
The Morphlings.
Masters of camouflage.

54:50.538 --> 54:53.833
Basically, won their Games by
hiding until everyone else was dead.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.503
Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.

54:56.669 --> 54:57.670
Not a threat.

54:59.214 --> 55:00.340
Finnick Odair, right?

55:00.507 --> 55:03.301
Yes. He won his Games at 14.
Youngest ever.

55:03.510 --> 55:05.470
- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.

55:05.553 --> 55:09.307
Yes, I'm kidding.
He's a peacock. A total preener.

55:09.390 --> 55:12.435
But he's The Capitol darling.
They love him here.

55:12.519 --> 55:17.232
Charming, smart, and very skilled at combat.
Especially in water.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.943
- What about weaknesses?
- One. Mags.

55:20.026 --> 55:21.820
She volunteered for Annie.

55:21.903 --> 55:25.031
Mags was his mentor
and basically raised him.

55:25.114 --> 55:28.660
If he's trying to protect her
in any way, it exposes him.

55:28.743 --> 55:30.495
A guy like that
has to know she's not gonna make it.

55:30.578 --> 55:32.831
I bet when it really comes down to it,
he won't protect her.

55:32.914 --> 55:35.959
Well, Katniss, I just hope when she goes,
she goes quickly.

55:36.042 --> 55:38.920
She's actually a wonderful lady.

56:04.779 --> 56:06.364
How'd we get here?

56:06.906 --> 56:08.324
Katniss.

56:09.242 --> 56:10.243
Hello, Finnick.

56:10.952 --> 56:12.245
Do you want a sugar cube?

56:14.080 --> 56:16.082
I mean, it's supposed to be
for the horses, but...

56:16.374 --> 56:18.001
I mean, who cares about them, right?

56:18.084 --> 56:20.336
They got years to eat sugar,
whereas you and I...

56:20.461 --> 56:22.338
Well, if we see something sweet,
we better grab it.

56:23.923 --> 56:26.801
No thanks. But I would love to
borrow that outfit someday.

56:27.135 --> 56:29.429
You look pretty
terrifying in that getup.

56:29.637 --> 56:31.347
What happened to
the pretty little girl dresses?

56:31.431 --> 56:32.390
I outgrew them.

56:32.473 --> 56:33.474
You certainly did.

56:34.601 --> 56:36.769
Shame about this Quell thing.

56:36.978 --> 56:40.523
Now, you could've made out
like a bandit in The Capitol.

56:40.607 --> 56:42.901
Jewels, money, anything you wanted.

56:42.984 --> 56:45.904
Well, I don't like jewels
and I have more money than I need, so...

56:46.112 --> 56:47.822
What did you do with all your wealth,
anyway?

56:47.947 --> 56:50.575
I haven't dealt in anything
as common as money in years.

56:50.783 --> 56:53.620
Then how do people pay for
the pleasure of your company?

56:56.497 --> 56:57.790
With secrets.

57:00.376 --> 57:02.545
What about you, Girl on Fire?

57:03.171 --> 57:05.048
Any secrets worth my time?

57:06.174 --> 57:07.634
I'm an open book.

57:07.884 --> 57:10.929
Everybody always seems to know
my secrets before I know them myself.

57:11.012 --> 57:12.972
Unfortunately, I think that's true.

57:15.725 --> 57:18.144
I'm sorry you had to
cancel your wedding.

57:18.895 --> 57:22.148
I know how devastating
that must be for you.

57:25.151 --> 57:26.527
Have a good day.

57:29.238 --> 57:30.823
- Peeta.
- Finnick.

57:32.700 --> 57:33.743
What'd he want?

57:33.826 --> 57:35.328
To know all my secrets.

57:36.079 --> 57:37.622
He'll have to get in line.

57:37.747 --> 57:40.208
<i>Tributes, mount up.</i>

57:40.291 --> 57:42.168
No waving and smiling, this time.

57:42.251 --> 57:43.503
I want you to look straight ahead

57:43.586 --> 57:46.422
as if the audience and this
whole event are beneath you.

57:47.215 --> 57:48.591
That should be easy.

57:49.717 --> 57:51.302
Press this when you're ready.

57:51.719 --> 57:52.845
Good luck.

58:16.703 --> 58:17.745
Here they come!

58:17.870 --> 58:19.622
From District 12. Our favorites.

58:19.706 --> 58:21.749
- Well...
- Or my favorite.

59:02.248 --> 59:03.291
There it is!

59:04.584 --> 59:05.918
Fire in the house!

59:06.794 --> 59:11.758
Katniss! Katniss! Katniss!

59:34.781 --> 59:37.200
Nice. Way to make friends
out there, you two.

59:37.283 --> 59:38.785
Well, we learned from the best.

59:38.868 --> 59:41.454
I wanna introduce you to
some special friends of mine.

59:41.537 --> 59:44.957
This is Seeder. And Chaff.
From District 11.

59:48.252 --> 59:49.545
He's very friendly.

59:49.629 --> 59:53.466
Don't invite him over.
He'll drink up your liquor.

59:53.800 --> 59:55.134
I'll see you guys soon.

59:55.468 --> 59:58.888
Let's get some of that makeup off you
and talk about these other Tributes.

59:58.971 --> 01:00:01.057
These Tributes are crazy.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.476
No, not all of 'em. He's a good guy.

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:05.812
Carry on.

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:14.237
You guys look amazing.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.321
Thank you.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:17.490
My stylist is such an idiot.

01:00:17.573 --> 01:00:21.160
District 7. Lumber. Trees.

01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:24.914
I'd love to put my ax in her face.

01:00:25.915 --> 01:00:27.333
So what do you think?

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.752
Now that the whole world
wants to sleep with you?

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:32.463
- I don't think that the whole world...
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.589
Okay.

01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:34.841
Will you unzip?

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:36.676
Yeah.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.079
Thanks. Let's do it again sometime.

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:06.873
Thank you.

01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:10.835
Johanna Mason, District 7.

01:01:14.297 --> 01:01:17.383
Remember, Katniss,
today's about making allies.

01:01:22.013 --> 01:01:24.599
So far I'm not overwhelmed
by our choices.

01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:28.895
I guess we just try to figure out
who we trust least

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.063
and work our way backwards from there.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:17.401
Friction generates heat.
Heat generates fire. In theory.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:19.612
You should move your hands downward.

01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:23.032
And faster, too.

01:02:34.335 --> 01:02:36.629
- A little brute force...
-...is always helpful.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.590
Thank you.

01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:41.634
By the corner of the table.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.803
Plutarch?

01:02:44.971 --> 01:02:46.806
No. Next to him.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.141
Force field.

01:02:49.308 --> 01:02:50.393
How do you know?

01:02:50.643 --> 01:02:51.811
The shimmering.

01:02:54.522 --> 01:02:56.023
Top left hand side.

01:02:56.899 --> 01:02:57.900
Look.

01:02:58.859 --> 01:02:59.860
There.

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:02.071
You see it?

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.157
Looks like glass.

01:03:05.241 --> 01:03:07.159
To separate us and them.

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:10.746
Probably my fault.
I shot an arrow at them last year.

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.331
Electromagnetic.

01:03:12.415 --> 01:03:13.416
How can you tell?

01:03:15.126 --> 01:03:17.211
Is it obvious or something?

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:20.673
"Is it obvious?"

01:03:22.383 --> 01:03:24.635
- They might as well have a sign.
- Look around you.

01:03:25.094 --> 01:03:28.514
All the holograms, the lights,
every now and then they flicker. Why?

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:31.350
Because the force field
is taking up too much energy.

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:34.603
There's always a flaw in the system.

01:03:46.449 --> 01:03:47.616
That's beautiful.

01:03:48.576 --> 01:03:50.745
I saw you volunteer
for that young girl.

01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:53.664
It was really brave.

01:04:02.048 --> 01:04:03.382
Prim is my sister.

01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:07.887
If you

01:04:08.304 --> 01:04:11.307
If you teach me how to make a fishhook
like that, I could teach you how to hunt.

01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:15.269
Yes, yes.

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:20.358
<i>Do you wanna try with me?</i>

01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:22.276
Okay.

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:24.028
I'll go first.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.301
<i>Good news.</i>

01:05:30.553 --> 01:05:33.681
At least half the Tributes
want you as an ally.

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:35.474
Well, they saw her shoot.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:38.185
Well, sweetheart,
you got your pick of the litter.

01:05:38.394 --> 01:05:39.728
I want Wiress and Beetee.

01:05:39.812 --> 01:05:41.897
Johanna calls them "Nuts" and "Volts."

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:44.942
- Well, okay, good. Now, who else?
- Mags.

01:05:47.153 --> 01:05:48.320
All right, fine, then no one.

01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:52.825
I'll tell them
you're still making up your mind.

01:06:09.842 --> 01:06:11.844
<i>District 3. Beetee Latter.</i>

01:06:12.428 --> 01:06:14.847
<i>Report for individual assessment.</i>

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:29.236
Peeta, how are we gonna
kill these people?

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:38.537
<i>District 12. Katniss Everdeen.</i>

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:41.248
<i>Report for individual assessment.</i>

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:17.743
Miss Everdeen.

01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:22.289
Miss Everdeen!

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:27.795
You have 10 minutes
to present your chosen skill.

01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:27.187
Thank you! Thank you!

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.648
Thank you for being here tonight

01:08:30.733 --> 01:08:35.194
on the eve of the 75th Hunger Games!

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:45.205
We have never seen anything like this.
And we will never see anything like it again.

01:08:46.457 --> 01:08:49.001
Because tonight, on this stage,

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:53.005
24 of Panem's brightest stars

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:56.634
will vie for the ultimate crown.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.013
Tonight will be their final opportunity
to express their thoughts.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.309
Our final opportunity
to express our love.

01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:07.394
And heartbreakingly,

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:14.068
to say goodbye to all but one.

01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:18.404
What a night.

01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:21.992
Let's hear it.

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:25.371
It's so exciting!

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.166
A wedding dress?

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:33.212
President Snow insisted,
but I made a few alterations.

01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:36.756
<i>You two made The Games
a family affair.</i>

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:39.885
You became everyone's
brother and sister.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.888
I don't know how we're
going to let you go.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.557
We're not going by choice.

01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:48.602
You are our family.

01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:51.313
And I don't see how anyone
can love us better.

01:09:52.064 --> 01:09:54.858
So sweet. So sweet.

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.443
Are you all right, dear?

01:09:56.568 --> 01:09:57.945
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

01:09:58.028 --> 01:09:59.613
<i>I just can't stop crying.</i>

01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:02.116
God! Does anybody
actually believe this?

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:04.535
Apparently, everybody.

01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:09.248
She is very good.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:11.333
These Victors are angry, Katniss.

01:10:11.417 --> 01:10:14.044
They'll say anything
to try and stop The Games.

01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:16.422
I suggest you do the same.

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:18.465
Beetee...

01:10:19.133 --> 01:10:22.678
You have contributed so much
to Panem over the years.

01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:25.681
I don't know who we will miss more.

01:10:25.764 --> 01:10:27.433
You or your brain.

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:34.231
If the Quarter Quell were written into law
by men, certainly, it can be unwritten.

01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:37.818
Yes. Interesting concept.

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:40.112
Finnick...

01:10:40.946 --> 01:10:45.409
I understand that you have a message
for somebody out there.

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:47.619
A special somebody.

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:50.998
Can we hear it?

01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:53.500
My love,

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:56.044
you have my heart

01:10:56.462 --> 01:10:58.130
for all eternity

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:03.719
and if I die in that arena,

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:07.723
my last thought will be of your lips.

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:11.685
We have seen a lot of
tears here tonight.

01:11:12.478 --> 01:11:14.396
But I see no tears in Johanna's eyes.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.023
Johanna, you are angry.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.316
Tell me why.

01:11:17.399 --> 01:11:19.651
Well, yes, I'm angry.

01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:22.196
You know, I'm getting
totally screwed over here.

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:26.909
The deal was that if I win the Hunger Games,
I get to live the rest of my life in peace.

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:29.453
But now you want to kill me again.

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:33.415
Well, you know what? ...that!

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:36.835
And...everybody that had anything
to do with it!

01:11:36.919 --> 01:11:38.212
All right then.

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.714
One woman's opinion.

01:11:41.006 --> 01:11:42.216
Who's next?

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:43.592
All right, turn around.

01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:46.929
<i>I know it's a bad break
for everyone involved.</i>

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:49.348
I think I'm done.

01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:51.350
Will I be twirling tonight?

01:11:51.517 --> 01:11:52.684
Save it for the end.

01:11:53.602 --> 01:11:55.646
One minute. Is she ready?

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.443
Katniss.

01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:08.325
You would have been
the most beautiful bride.

01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:10.410
Thank you.

01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:15.874
Let's go show them
what real beauty looks like.

01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:17.876
It has to go more up.

01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:20.504
Pretty, pretty, Katniss,
they're going to adore you.

01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:23.298
And there are a lot of sponsors
in the audience,

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:26.218
so of course, just be your usual self.

01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:28.136
Actually, be your happier self.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.639
Really? A wedding dress?

01:12:30.889 --> 01:12:32.391
Snow made me wear it.

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:37.396
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...</i>

01:12:37.563 --> 01:12:39.356
<i>- You know her...
- Make him pay for it.</i>

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:40.566
<i>...as the Girl on Fire.</i>

01:12:40.649 --> 01:12:43.318
<i>The Victor of last
year's Hunger Games.</i>

01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:45.737
<i>Katniss Everdeen!</i>

01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:04.423
Katniss Everdeen, you look fabulous.
Doesn't she?

01:13:09.469 --> 01:13:10.971
My, my!

01:13:12.806 --> 01:13:14.099
Now, Katniss,

01:13:14.975 --> 01:13:16.602
this is

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:22.691
a very big and very emotional night

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:24.484
for all of us.

01:13:24.568 --> 01:13:25.944
Wouldn't you say?

01:13:26.028 --> 01:13:28.238
Don't go crying on me now, Caesar.

01:13:28.322 --> 01:13:30.032
I can't make any promises.
You know me.

01:13:30.115 --> 01:13:32.576
You know I wouldn't believe you,
even if you did.

01:13:32.659 --> 01:13:35.370
I love her!
The Girl on Fire is so cheeky.

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:40.834
But, Katniss, on a more serious note.

01:13:43.003 --> 01:13:47.090
I think we're all here a little disappointed,
more than a little disappointed,

01:13:47.174 --> 01:13:50.469
that a certain wedding
did not take place.

01:13:52.137 --> 01:13:53.805
Aren't we, folks?

01:13:54.973 --> 01:13:58.894
Alas. But am I correct in assuming

01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:04.566
that this is the gown that you would
have worn on that day, yes or no?

01:14:05.651 --> 01:14:08.987
Yes, President Snow thought
everyone would want to see it.

01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:12.324
Well, President Snow,
as usual, was right.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.284
Was he not, folks?

01:14:14.368 --> 01:14:16.244
I love it! I love it!

01:14:16.328 --> 01:14:17.329
Don't you love it, folks?

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:19.081
It's incredible. It's so gorgeous.

01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:22.250
Will you do us the honor?
Please? Please? Please?

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:36.515
Oh, my God!

01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:40.519
Oh, my!

01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:49.611
It's a bird.

01:14:49.695 --> 01:14:53.949
It's got feathers. It's like a bird.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:55.367
It's like a...

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:56.618
Like a Mockingjay.

01:14:57.619 --> 01:15:01.623
Your stylist certainly has
outdone himself this time, hasn't he?

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:02.958
<i>What theatricality!</i>

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:04.209
<i>Cinna!</i>

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:06.211
<i>Take a bow.</i>

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:15.637
But, Peeta,

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:20.809
the wedding, the
marriage, never to be?

01:15:22.144 --> 01:15:24.146
Well, actually, we got married.

01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:25.313
In secret.

01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:28.108
A secret wedding?

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.609
All right. Do tell.

01:15:30.444 --> 01:15:33.321
- We want our love to be eternal.
- Of course.

01:15:33.405 --> 01:15:36.742
You know, Katniss and I,
we've been luckier than most.

01:15:37.117 --> 01:15:39.161
And I wouldn't have
any regrets at all

01:15:40.912 --> 01:15:43.081
if it weren't...

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.293
If...

01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:50.797
If it weren't for what? What?

01:15:52.591 --> 01:15:54.426
If it weren't for the baby.

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:57.637
All right. This is news!

01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:58.889
Let's find out more.

01:16:01.349 --> 01:16:03.769
Calm down. This is news to all of us.

01:16:03.852 --> 01:16:04.853
Call off The Games!

01:16:05.771 --> 01:16:06.772
All right.

01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:11.860
- Let's...
- Stop The Games!

01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:13.403
Everybody, calm down.

01:16:13.487 --> 01:16:16.573
It's a great night. A great night.

01:16:21.286 --> 01:16:23.455
This is news to all of us.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.459
All right, all right, all right.

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.670
We're going to find out
what we do about this.

01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:36.468
Cancel The Games!

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.054
Stop The Games!

01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:52.692
There's no way they'll cancel.
They can't.

01:16:56.655 --> 01:16:59.074
Baby bomb was a stroke of genius.

01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:02.077
Unfortunately, Games are still on.

01:17:02.536 --> 01:17:04.329
This is goodbye, for now.

01:17:06.706 --> 01:17:08.708
Presents for the boys.

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:10.669
What is this?

01:17:12.587 --> 01:17:14.506
Your token. Remember?

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.716
Hair for me. Pin for Katniss.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.301
Gold bangle for you.

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:22.222
And for Peeta,
the medallion that we talked about.

01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:25.308
Thank you, Effie.

01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:29.688
We're a team. Aren't we?

01:17:32.232 --> 01:17:35.527
And I'm so proud of my Victors.

01:17:37.237 --> 01:17:38.738
So proud.

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:42.367
You're so...

01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:50.876
Well, you both deserved so much better.

01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:53.712
Thank you, Effie.

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:56.715
I am truly sorry.

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.723
Thank you, Haymitch.

01:18:05.807 --> 01:18:07.184
For everything.

01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:10.937
Any last advice?

01:18:13.481 --> 01:18:14.733
Stay alive.

01:18:16.902 --> 01:18:18.403
Haymitch, wait.

01:18:20.822 --> 01:18:22.157
Remember our deal.

01:18:24.743 --> 01:18:26.912
Do whatever it takes
to keep him alive.

01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:29.331
Promise me.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:30.790
Okay.

01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:37.923
Katniss, when you're in the arena,
remember who the real enemy is.

01:18:48.183 --> 01:18:50.894
I don't want to be with
anyone else in there.

01:18:51.603 --> 01:18:52.854
Just you.

01:18:59.444 --> 01:19:01.238
If that's what you want.

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:04.074
That's what I want.

01:19:10.038 --> 01:19:11.706
I'll see you soon.

01:19:37.023 --> 01:19:38.066
Your tracker.

01:20:06.428 --> 01:20:09.597
Look at this. They're holding hands.

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:12.017
I want them dead.

01:20:13.393 --> 01:20:14.769
Be patient.

01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:19.691
They're holding hands now, but the minute
the gun goes off, it'll be a bloodbath.

01:20:22.027 --> 01:20:24.571
And the whole idea of revolution
will be discredited.

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:26.364
And the idea of her?

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:29.075
The idea of the Mockingjay?

01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:34.247
The more allies she betrays,
the more friends she kills,

01:20:35.165 --> 01:20:36.624
the more she reveals her true self.

01:20:36.708 --> 01:20:41.212
As long as it ends with her picture
in the sky and the sound of cannon.

01:20:41.296 --> 01:20:43.715
- And it shall.
- It better.

01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:47.218
Let's watch her get her
hands dirty first.

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:50.638
Excuse me.

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:03.610
Let's start.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:11.868
This suit is light. No thermal.

01:21:12.077 --> 01:21:14.079
So I'd guess tropics or desert.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:16.915
<i>Sixty seconds to launch.</i>

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.960
That dress was beautiful.

01:21:22.087 --> 01:21:24.381
I think it was the best
one you've ever made.

01:21:25.465 --> 01:21:26.883
I thought you'd like it.

01:21:27.592 --> 01:21:29.135
I just wanted to tell
you, because I don't...

01:21:29.219 --> 01:21:30.303
Stop.

01:21:31.846 --> 01:21:34.516
Remember, I'm still betting on you,
Girl on Fire.

01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:53.493
<i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

01:22:17.392 --> 01:22:18.518
No!

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:20.228
Cinna! No!

01:22:23.314 --> 01:22:25.525
No!No!No!

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.527
No! Cinna!

01:22:28.069 --> 01:22:30.405
No! No!

01:22:30.488 --> 01:22:31.656
No!

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.491
No!

01:22:36.119 --> 01:22:38.830
No, no...

01:22:59.934 --> 01:23:03.188
<i>Let the 75th Hunger Games begin.</i>

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:06.858
<i>May the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:08.109
Peeta?

01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:15.575
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:18.119
<i>seven, six,</i>

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:20.997
<i>five, four,</i>

01:23:21.456 --> 01:23:24.042
<i>three, two,</i>

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:25.543
One

01:24:10.338 --> 01:24:11.631
Good thing we're allies, right?

01:24:12.507 --> 01:24:13.675
Where did you get that?

01:24:13.758 --> 01:24:14.842
Where do you think?

01:24:16.094 --> 01:24:17.095
Duck.

01:24:20.765 --> 01:24:22.016
Don't trust 1 and 2.

01:24:22.267 --> 01:24:23.810
I'll take this side.
You hold them off.

01:24:24.102 --> 01:24:25.478
I'll go find Peeta.

01:24:29.023 --> 01:24:31.109
Katniss, Mags found him.
He's over here.

01:25:24.996 --> 01:25:27.081
Katniss, Katniss, go, go, go, go.

01:25:46.351 --> 01:25:48.227
Okay, hold up. Hold up.

01:25:49.896 --> 01:25:51.022
Here you go.

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:53.232
Okay. You all right now?

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.361
Okay?

01:26:01.282 --> 01:26:02.784
God, it's hot.

01:26:03.451 --> 01:26:05.244
We gotta find fresh water.

01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:19.467
Well, I guess we're not
holding hands any more.

01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:20.927
You think that's funny?

01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:24.472
Every time that cannon goes off,
it's music to my ears.

01:26:25.056 --> 01:26:26.724
I don't care about any of them.

01:26:27.558 --> 01:26:28.601
Good to hear.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.854
Want to face the Career Pack alone?

01:26:33.064 --> 01:26:34.315
What would Haymitch say?

01:26:34.399 --> 01:26:35.733
Haymitch isn't here.

01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:39.237
Let's keep moving.

01:27:22.822 --> 01:27:23.823
Peeta, no!

01:27:30.329 --> 01:27:31.414
Peeta?

01:27:32.957 --> 01:27:34.041
Peeta?

01:27:34.459 --> 01:27:36.627
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

01:27:36.711 --> 01:27:38.379
He's not breathing! Peeta!

01:27:44.594 --> 01:27:45.595
Peeta?

01:27:46.262 --> 01:27:47.263
Peeta?

01:27:48.181 --> 01:27:49.724
Come on! Come on!

01:27:49.807 --> 01:27:50.892
Please, wake up.

01:27:51.434 --> 01:27:52.435
No.

01:27:55.396 --> 01:27:56.606
Please, wake up.

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:58.524
- Come on.
- Come on!

01:27:59.317 --> 01:28:00.985
Bring me in closer.

01:28:05.907 --> 01:28:06.991
Cannon ready?

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:14.665
Come on. Come on. Come on, Peeta!

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:18.669
Please, Peeta. Peeta.

01:28:21.047 --> 01:28:22.215
Come on.

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:25.676
Peeta? Peeta.

01:28:30.306 --> 01:28:31.891
Oh, my God.

01:28:32.225 --> 01:28:34.018
Be careful.
There's a force field up there.

01:28:37.605 --> 01:28:40.441
Oh, my God. You were dead.

01:28:41.067 --> 01:28:43.653
You were dead. Your heart stopped.

01:28:43.861 --> 01:28:45.071
It's okay.

01:28:45.738 --> 01:28:47.365
It's working now.

01:28:50.535 --> 01:28:53.120
- You... Do you wanna stand up?
- Yeah.

01:29:03.506 --> 01:29:04.632
It's okay.

01:29:12.807 --> 01:29:15.059
Someday I want to love
someone that much.

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:18.896
And so you shall, my darling.
So you shall.

01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:42.128
Hang on.

01:30:39.393 --> 01:30:40.811
<i>The force field...</i>

01:30:40.895 --> 01:30:43.147
It's a dome. We're at
the edge of the arena.

01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:45.608
We couldn't find any
signs of fresh water.

01:30:47.318 --> 01:30:48.778
It's gonna get dark soon.

01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:50.488
We'll be safe with
our backs protected.

01:30:50.571 --> 01:30:54.325
We should set up camp.
Take turns sleeping. I can take first watch.

01:30:54.659 --> 01:30:55.743
Not a chance.

01:30:57.912 --> 01:31:00.581
Honey, that thing I did
back there for Peeta?

01:31:00.665 --> 01:31:01.958
That was called "saving his life."

01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:04.502
If I wanted to kill either of you,
I would've done it by now.

01:31:09.924 --> 01:31:12.093
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll take the first watch.

01:31:14.845 --> 01:31:16.180
Just for a little bit.

01:31:33.739 --> 01:31:34.865
How's Peeta?

01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:40.121
He's okay, I think.

01:31:40.204 --> 01:31:42.289
Just dehydrated like the rest of us.

01:32:15.573 --> 01:32:16.657
Eight.

01:32:29.295 --> 01:32:30.296
Hey.

01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:39.889
Drink up"?

01:32:40.264 --> 01:32:41.265
What is it?

01:32:41.432 --> 01:32:42.641
It's from Haymitch.

01:32:44.977 --> 01:32:46.270
I think it's a spile.

01:32:46.562 --> 01:32:47.563
A What?

01:33:03.245 --> 01:33:05.915
You're kidding me. You're kidding me.

01:33:06.082 --> 01:33:07.583
Get some water.

01:33:17.468 --> 01:33:18.803
I'm gonna get a leaf.

01:33:24.058 --> 01:33:25.643
I'll get some for Mags.

01:33:25.935 --> 01:33:27.144
There we go.

01:33:35.194 --> 01:33:36.737
Want some more?

01:34:08.394 --> 01:34:09.687
I counted 12.

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:12.481
Midnight?

01:34:12.982 --> 01:34:14.525
Or the number of districts.

01:34:30.624 --> 01:34:32.168
Well...

01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:36.130
If you're not gonna sleep, I will.

01:34:36.797 --> 01:34:37.798
Okay.

01:35:57.962 --> 01:36:01.340
Run! Run! The fog is poison!

01:36:02.216 --> 01:36:03.676
Come on, come on, come on

01:36:06.011 --> 01:36:07.012
There!

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.037
God! God!

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.042
Mags, please, please!
Come on! Come on!

01:37:20.419 --> 01:37:21.420
Peeta.

01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:29.553
I can't carry him.

01:37:30.429 --> 01:37:31.680
Peeta, please.

01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:34.808
Peeta, please, stand up.
We have to go.

01:37:36.518 --> 01:37:37.561
Mags?

01:37:38.145 --> 01:37:39.980
- Mags? Mags!
- Finnick.

01:37:40.064 --> 01:37:41.357
- Mags!
- Finnick.

01:37:41.774 --> 01:37:42.816
Mags!

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:45.444
Finnick! Finnick, we have to go.

01:37:45.527 --> 01:37:47.112
We have to get outta here.

01:37:49.073 --> 01:37:50.491
We have to go.

01:37:51.450 --> 01:37:54.370
All right, come on, come on. Come on.

01:37:54.661 --> 01:37:55.662
Okay.

01:38:08.884 --> 01:38:10.260
Shit!

01:39:45.522 --> 01:39:48.984
The water! The water helps.

01:40:37.324 --> 01:40:38.784
We need our weapons.

01:41:06.937 --> 01:41:08.438
I'm sorry about Mags.

01:41:15.696 --> 01:41:17.447
She was never gonna make it.

01:41:19.283 --> 01:41:20.367
So...

01:41:39.136 --> 01:41:40.137
What?

01:42:04.494 --> 01:42:06.330
- Peeta.
- Yeah?

01:42:07.164 --> 01:42:09.041
Walk over here slowly.

01:42:41.406 --> 01:42:42.699
Get to the beach.

01:43:52.769 --> 01:43:54.229
We gotta get to the beach!

01:44:18.295 --> 01:44:21.339
- Who is that?
- A Morphling! Help me get her!

01:44:47.073 --> 01:44:49.367
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

01:44:53.205 --> 01:44:57.083
Hey, you wanna see something?
Look up. Look.

01:44:58.543 --> 01:45:00.837
Look at it. Look at that.

01:45:01.713 --> 01:45:03.173
It's incredible, isn't it?

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.217
All those colors.

01:45:06.343 --> 01:45:08.094
Don't worry about anything else.

01:45:09.387 --> 01:45:10.889
I'll be right here with you.

01:45:11.264 --> 01:45:13.558
It's okay. It's okay.

01:46:12.868 --> 01:46:16.037
She sacrificed herself for me
and I didn't even know her name.

01:46:18.456 --> 01:46:20.876
You think she sacrificed herself?

01:46:22.752 --> 01:46:24.254
Looked like it.

01:46:26.923 --> 01:46:28.842
That doesn't make any sense.

01:46:56.494 --> 01:46:58.455
Look. For you.

01:47:03.543 --> 01:47:04.878
Thank you.

01:47:12.135 --> 01:47:13.511
That's new.

01:48:06.606 --> 01:48:08.024
Someone's here.

01:48:17.033 --> 01:48:18.118
Johanna?

01:48:19.536 --> 01:48:21.913
- Johanna!
- Finnick!

01:48:27.043 --> 01:48:28.712
Guess we have more allies.

01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:39.931
Well...

01:48:40.724 --> 01:48:42.100
I got 'em out.

01:48:42.475 --> 01:48:46.438
We were all the way deep into the jungle
where I thought it was gonna be safe.

01:48:47.564 --> 01:48:49.149
That's when the rain started.

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.818
I thought it was water.

01:48:52.152 --> 01:48:53.945
It turned out to be blood.

01:48:54.237 --> 01:48:57.198
- Tick took.
- Hot, thick blood.

01:48:57.282 --> 01:48:58.658
- It was coming down.
- Tick took.

01:48:58.742 --> 01:49:00.201
It was choking us.

01:49:00.285 --> 01:49:02.996
We were stumbling around,
gagging on it, blind.

01:49:03.246 --> 01:49:04.205
Tick took.

01:49:04.289 --> 01:49:07.250
- That's when Blight hit the force field.
- Tick took.

01:49:07.333 --> 01:49:08.918
Tick took.

01:49:09.002 --> 01:49:11.296
He wasn't much, but he was from home.

01:49:11.421 --> 01:49:12.672
Tick took.

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.467
Tick took.

01:49:16.259 --> 01:49:17.844
- Tick took.
- What's wrong with her?

01:49:17.927 --> 01:49:19.554
- She's in shock.
- Tick took.

01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:22.599
Dehydration isn't helping.
Do you have fresh water?

01:49:22.682 --> 01:49:23.850
- We can get some.
- Just...

01:49:23.933 --> 01:49:25.060
Tick took.

01:49:25.143 --> 01:49:27.437
Listen. Stop it!

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.105
- Hey! Lay off her!
- Just sit down!

01:49:29.939 --> 01:49:31.983
Hey! What are you doing?

01:49:32.067 --> 01:49:34.486
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I got them out for you!

01:49:34.694 --> 01:49:36.029
It's okay. It's okay.

01:49:36.112 --> 01:49:37.238
Let me go, Finnick!

01:49:37.322 --> 01:49:39.574
- For me? What does that mean?
- Let me go.

01:49:39.657 --> 01:49:41.367
- You did want them as allies.
- I'm fine.

01:49:46.623 --> 01:49:48.458
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:51.920
Tick took.

01:49:52.003 --> 01:49:53.213
- Tick took.
- Tick took!

01:49:53.671 --> 01:49:54.672
Tick took, okay.

01:50:07.852 --> 01:50:08.895
What does Beetee have there?

01:50:08.978 --> 01:50:11.481
The coil? It's some kind of wire.

01:50:13.525 --> 01:50:15.360
Did he get it from the Cornucopia?

01:50:16.528 --> 01:50:18.154
Took a knife in the back to get it.

01:50:19.447 --> 01:50:20.824
- Tick took! Tick took!
- All right.

01:50:21.658 --> 01:50:22.826
I can't.

01:50:23.076 --> 01:50:24.828
Just... Have fun with "Nuts."

01:50:35.505 --> 01:50:36.548
Tick took.

01:50:36.756 --> 01:50:38.007
Tick took.

01:50:39.342 --> 01:50:40.677
It's a clock.

01:50:42.345 --> 01:50:43.555
It's a clock.

01:50:43.638 --> 01:50:46.224
My God, it's a clock!
Wiress, you're a genius.

01:50:46.349 --> 01:50:47.475
You're a genius!

01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:00.446
<i>This entire arena seems to be laid out
like a clock with a new threat every hour,</i>

01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:02.615
<i>but they stay only within their wedge.</i>

01:51:02.907 --> 01:51:04.367
<i>It all starts with the lightning.</i>

01:51:04.659 --> 01:51:06.452
Then the blood rain, fog, monkeys.

01:51:06.536 --> 01:51:07.996
That's the first four hours.

01:51:08.079 --> 01:51:10.248
At 10:00, that big wave
hits from over there.

01:51:10.456 --> 01:51:12.208
Wiress, you're a genius.

01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:14.210
Look, the tail points to 12.

01:51:14.752 --> 01:51:16.921
That's where the lightning strikes
at noon and midnight.

01:51:17.130 --> 01:51:19.382
- Strikes where?
- That big tree.

01:51:22.886 --> 01:51:23.887
Good.

01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:28.099
"Hickory dickory dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.

01:51:28.433 --> 01:51:30.894
"The clock struck one,
the mouse ran down.

01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:32.645
"Hickory dickory dock."

01:51:36.316 --> 01:51:38.401
So 12:00 to 1:00, lightning.

01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:40.278
Then 1:00 to 2:00 is blood.

01:51:40.612 --> 01:51:42.739
Then fog. And then monkeys.

01:51:43.072 --> 01:51:46.868
"Hickory dickory dock.
The dog barked at the clock.

01:51:46.951 --> 01:51:47.994
"The clock struck 3:00..."

01:51:48.077 --> 01:51:49.537
And then 10:00 to 11:00, the wave.

01:51:49.621 --> 01:51:51.414
What about everything else?
Did you guys see anything?

01:51:51.497 --> 01:51:52.540
"Hickory dickory dock."

01:51:52.624 --> 01:51:54.459
- Nothing but blood.
- It doesn't matter.

01:51:54.584 --> 01:51:57.212
As long as we steer clear of whichever
sector is active, we'll be safe.

01:51:57.295 --> 01:51:58.922
Yeah. Relatively speaking.

01:52:27.492 --> 01:52:28.826
Change it up. Spin it.

01:52:37.293 --> 01:52:38.294
Come on! Come on!

01:52:57.981 --> 01:52:58.982
Hold on!

01:53:14.664 --> 01:53:17.000
No!

01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:20.920
Okay. That's enough.

01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:23.840
Let's see how they tell time now.

01:53:47.530 --> 01:53:48.531
You Okay?

01:53:51.409 --> 01:53:54.370
Let's just get what we need
and get off the bloody island.

01:54:03.379 --> 01:54:05.715
So besides Brutus and
Enobaria, who's left?

01:54:05.798 --> 01:54:06.799
Maybe Chaff.

01:54:06.883 --> 01:54:08.676
- Just those three.
- They know they're outnumbered.

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.178
I doubt they'll attack again.

01:54:10.303 --> 01:54:11.721
We're safe here on the beach.

01:54:11.888 --> 01:54:13.097
So what do we do? We hunt 'em down?

01:54:15.224 --> 01:54:16.768
Katniss, help me!

01:54:17.143 --> 01:54:18.144
Prim!

01:54:18.269 --> 01:54:19.979
- Prim! Prim!
- No!

01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:21.773
Katniss! Katniss, wait!

01:54:21.981 --> 01:54:24.400
Prim! Prim!

01:54:26.402 --> 01:54:27.487
Prim!

01:54:27.904 --> 01:54:28.905
Prim!

01:54:29.072 --> 01:54:30.239
Katniss!

01:54:32.283 --> 01:54:34.869
Help me! Help me!

01:54:38.581 --> 01:54:39.832
Katniss!

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:45.296
- You okay?
- Finnick!

01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.506
Finnick!

01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:48.007
- No! It's not her.
- Annie!

01:54:48.925 --> 01:54:49.926
Annie!

01:54:50.093 --> 01:54:53.096
- Annie! Annie!
- Finnick! It's not her.

01:54:53.262 --> 01:54:54.555
It's just a jabberjay. It's not her.

01:54:54.639 --> 01:54:55.932
Well, how do you think
they got that sound?

01:54:56.015 --> 01:54:57.767
- Jabberjays copy.
- Katniss!

01:54:58.518 --> 01:54:59.519
Gale.

01:55:03.106 --> 01:55:04.774
Come on, come on, come on!

01:55:22.542 --> 01:55:23.543
Peeta!

01:55:24.961 --> 01:55:27.088
Stop, stop, stop! It's okay!

01:55:29.632 --> 01:55:31.968
It's okay! They're just mutts!
It's not real!

01:55:43.896 --> 01:55:45.648
It's over. It's okay. They're gone.

01:55:45.815 --> 01:55:47.984
The hour's gone.
The hour's up. It's all right.

01:55:48.985 --> 01:55:51.112
- Prim! Find Prim!
- No, no. Prim's okay.

01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:54.073
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:57.452
Okay? They won't touch Prim.
All right?

01:55:59.662 --> 01:56:02.081
Your fianc√©'s right.
The whole country loves your sister.

01:56:02.665 --> 01:56:04.834
If they tortured her or
did anything to her,

01:56:04.917 --> 01:56:09.881
forget the districts, there would
be riots in the damn Capitol.

01:56:13.676 --> 01:56:15.386
Hey, how does that sound, Snow?

01:56:15.595 --> 01:56:19.223
What if we set your backyard on fire?

01:56:20.057 --> 01:56:23.853
You know, you can't put
everybody in here.

01:56:29.233 --> 01:56:30.234
What?

01:56:31.777 --> 01:56:33.237
They can't hurt me.

01:56:34.363 --> 01:56:35.823
There's no one left that I love.

01:56:39.535 --> 01:56:41.078
I'll get you some water.

01:57:07.897 --> 01:57:09.232
Thank you.

01:57:21.077 --> 01:57:22.245
Who's Annie?

01:57:26.749 --> 01:57:29.710
Annie Cresta.
The girl Mags volunteered for.

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:35.132
She won, like, four years...
Five years ago.

01:57:36.759 --> 01:57:38.844
Is she the one that went a little...

01:57:49.021 --> 01:57:50.773
Love is weird.

01:57:55.278 --> 01:57:56.445
I have a plan.

01:58:00.783 --> 01:58:01.867
Finnick!

01:58:02.618 --> 01:58:03.995
I have a plan.

01:58:08.332 --> 01:58:10.626
Where do the Careers feel safest?
The jungle?

01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:12.295
The jungle's a nightmare.

01:58:12.628 --> 01:58:14.380
Probably here on the beach.

01:58:14.463 --> 01:58:15.631
Then why are they not here?

01:58:15.715 --> 01:58:17.800
Because we are. We claimed it.

01:58:17.883 --> 01:58:19.635
And if we left, they would come.

01:58:19.719 --> 01:58:21.721
Or stay hidden in the tree line.

01:58:21.804 --> 01:58:25.933
Which in just over four hours will be
soaked with water from the 10:00 wave.

01:58:26.309 --> 01:58:27.602
And what happens at midnight?

01:58:27.685 --> 01:58:30.396
- Lightning strikes that tree.
- Here's what I propose.

01:58:30.479 --> 01:58:34.150
We leave the beach at dusk.
We head to the lightning tree.

01:58:34.233 --> 01:58:35.985
That should draw them
back to the beach.

01:58:36.235 --> 01:58:40.031
Prior to midnight, we then run this
wire from the tree to the water.

01:58:40.823 --> 01:58:44.702
Anyone in the water or on the damp sand
will be electrocuted.

01:58:46.829 --> 01:58:49.040
How do we know
the wire's not gonna burn up?

01:58:49.248 --> 01:58:50.875
Because I invented it.

01:58:51.167 --> 01:58:53.210
I assure you, it won't burn up.

01:59:04.096 --> 01:59:06.599
Well, it's better than
hunting them down.

01:59:06.766 --> 01:59:07.767
Yeah, why not?

01:59:08.517 --> 01:59:10.561
If it fails, no harm
done anyway, right?

01:59:11.562 --> 01:59:13.230
All right, I say we try it.

01:59:13.898 --> 01:59:15.566
<i>So what can we do to help?</i>

01:59:17.568 --> 01:59:19.612
<i>Keep me alive for the next six hours.</i>

01:59:19.695 --> 01:59:21.572
<i>That would be extremely helpful.</i>

01:59:35.586 --> 01:59:37.129
I think we need to go.

01:59:37.588 --> 01:59:39.090
This plan's gonna work.

01:59:39.757 --> 01:59:41.175
I think so, too.

01:59:41.258 --> 01:59:44.261
And once the Careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.

01:59:45.137 --> 01:59:47.139
I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.

01:59:47.431 --> 01:59:48.933
What if they don't either?

01:59:49.892 --> 01:59:51.894
What if all of us refuse to shoot first?

01:59:52.228 --> 01:59:54.355
We might still end up dead.

01:59:55.272 --> 01:59:57.942
Maybe not.
I mean, it worked for us last time.

01:59:58.651 --> 02:00:00.736
They're not gonna
make that same mistake again.

02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:04.115
You know and I know there's only
one person walking out of here.

02:00:04.198 --> 02:00:05.866
And it's gonna be one of us.

02:00:08.744 --> 02:00:10.496
The Careers are still out there.

02:00:11.997 --> 02:00:14.458
We should stick with these guys
till midnight.

02:00:15.084 --> 02:00:17.712
And if we hear a cannon, we go.

02:00:30.516 --> 02:00:34.145
Katniss, I don't know what kinda deals
you made with Haymitoh

02:00:34.228 --> 02:00:36.105
but he made me promises, too.

02:00:46.615 --> 02:00:49.952
If you die and I live,

02:00:52.997 --> 02:00:54.623
I'd have nothing.

02:00:56.125 --> 02:00:58.127
Nobody else that I care about.

02:00:58.502 --> 02:00:59.670
Peeta.

02:00:59.962 --> 02:01:01.338
It's different for you.

02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:03.090
Your family needs you.

02:01:12.141 --> 02:01:13.309
You have to live.

02:01:14.643 --> 02:01:15.936
For them.

02:01:25.571 --> 02:01:26.989
What about you?

02:01:29.366 --> 02:01:30.993
Nobody needs me.

02:01:34.038 --> 02:01:35.164
I do.

02:01:36.373 --> 02:01:37.750
I need you.

02:02:02.233 --> 02:02:04.068
All right, lovebirds!

02:02:10.115 --> 02:02:12.326
She is preparing to fight.

02:02:12.409 --> 02:02:14.036
That's our girl.

02:02:18.123 --> 02:02:20.251
This is what you predicted.

02:02:27.216 --> 02:02:29.385
Moves and countermoves.

02:02:30.427 --> 02:02:31.554
Indeed.

02:02:36.642 --> 02:02:37.726
We'll toast when it's done?

02:02:39.144 --> 02:02:42.898
In the meantime, make
yourself comfortable.

02:03:50.591 --> 02:03:52.092
Minimal charring.

02:03:52.509 --> 02:03:54.136
It's an impressive conductor.

02:03:54.511 --> 02:03:55.971
Let's get started.

02:03:59.266 --> 02:04:02.811
Typically a lightning strike
contains five billion joules of energy.

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:06.982
We don't want to be anywhere
in the vicinity when this hits.

02:04:08.192 --> 02:04:10.319
You two girls, go together now.

02:04:10.694 --> 02:04:13.197
Take this. Unspool it carefully.

02:04:13.322 --> 02:04:15.240
Make sure the entire coil is in the water.
You understand?

02:04:15.324 --> 02:04:18.327
Then head to the tree at the 2:00 sector.
We'll meet you there.

02:04:18.827 --> 02:04:20.537
I'm gonna go with them as a guard.

02:04:20.663 --> 02:04:22.706
No,no,no.
You're staying here to protect me.

02:04:23.666 --> 02:04:24.833
And the tree.

02:04:25.292 --> 02:04:26.669
No, I need to go with her.

02:04:26.835 --> 02:04:29.546
There are two Careers out there.
I need two guards.

02:04:30.506 --> 02:04:32.424
Finnick can protect you
just fine on his own.

02:04:32.508 --> 02:04:36.053
Why can't Finnick and Johanna stay with
you and Peeta and I'll take the coil?

02:04:36.637 --> 02:04:39.348
You all agreed to keep me alive
till midnight, correct?

02:04:39.807 --> 02:04:42.184
It's his plan. We all agreed to it.

02:04:42.351 --> 02:04:43.894
Is there a problem here?

02:04:44.353 --> 02:04:45.562
Excellent question.

02:04:47.982 --> 02:04:50.526
No. There's no problem.

02:04:57.533 --> 02:04:58.909
I'll see you at midnight.

02:05:00.035 --> 02:05:01.787
All right, let's go!

02:05:31.025 --> 02:05:32.026
Come on.

02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:36.238
I want to put as much distance
between me and this beach as possible.

02:05:36.655 --> 02:05:38.907
Frying is not how I want to go.

02:05:39.575 --> 02:05:40.909
There's something...

02:05:59.053 --> 02:06:01.055
Stay down.

02:06:08.562 --> 02:06:09.605
Come on.

02:06:28.457 --> 02:06:30.375
Johanna, where are you?

02:06:41.970 --> 02:06:42.971
Johanna?

02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:48.811
Peeta.

02:07:03.450 --> 02:07:04.451
Peeta.

02:07:18.173 --> 02:07:20.008
Beetee. Beetee!

02:07:32.354 --> 02:07:33.564
Peeta!

02:07:39.403 --> 02:07:40.404
Peeta!

02:07:55.043 --> 02:07:56.628
Katniss, where are you?

02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:07.222
Let it fly, Miss Everdeen.

02:08:07.764 --> 02:08:10.184
Let it fly.

02:08:19.902 --> 02:08:21.069
Katniss.

02:08:25.407 --> 02:08:27.701
Remember who the real enemy is.

02:09:06.073 --> 02:09:07.574
Katniss, get away from that tree!

02:09:14.206 --> 02:09:15.999
Katniss, get away from that tree!

02:09:35.894 --> 02:09:37.771
It's not possible.

02:09:41.191 --> 02:09:42.567
Heavensbee!

02:09:46.321 --> 02:09:48.573
Plutarch Heavensbee!

02:09:53.829 --> 02:09:56.164
Sir, we've lost power.

02:12:22.978 --> 02:12:25.814
She's gonna lose it
when she finds out about the boy.

02:12:26.273 --> 02:12:27.941
She'll still cooperate, though?

02:12:28.525 --> 02:12:30.610
Without Peeta? There's no guarantee.

02:12:30.819 --> 02:12:32.154
Just tell her her win...

02:12:37.784 --> 02:12:38.994
Morning, sweetheart.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.002
What are you doing with them?

02:12:47.711 --> 02:12:50.464
You and a syringe against The Capitol?

02:12:50.672 --> 02:12:52.924
See, this is why
no one lets you make the plans.

02:12:53.383 --> 02:12:55.093
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- Stop.

02:12:55.177 --> 02:12:57.262
Stop. Just listen.

02:12:57.345 --> 02:13:00.348
We couldn't tell you with Snow watching.
It was too risky.

02:13:01.016 --> 02:13:02.684
Better for you to know nothing.

02:13:05.187 --> 02:13:06.313
Where's Peeta?

02:13:06.396 --> 02:13:07.647
Now, Katniss...

02:13:07.731 --> 02:13:09.774
You have been our mission
from the beginning.

02:13:10.066 --> 02:13:12.027
The plan was always to get you out.

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:14.154
Half the Tributes were in on it.

02:13:14.362 --> 02:13:17.949
This is the revolution.
And you are the Mockingjay.

02:13:19.159 --> 02:13:21.620
And we're on our way
to District 13 right now.

02:13:21.703 --> 02:13:22.829
13?

02:13:22.913 --> 02:13:24.664
13. Yes.

02:13:24.873 --> 02:13:26.249
Where's Peeta?

02:13:27.542 --> 02:13:31.213
He still has his tracker in his arm.
Johanna cut yours out.

02:13:32.214 --> 02:13:33.340
Where is he?

02:13:33.715 --> 02:13:34.883
In The Capitol.

02:13:36.384 --> 02:13:38.386
They got him and Johanna.

02:13:38.887 --> 02:13:41.932
You son of a bitch! You son of a...

02:13:42.015 --> 02:13:45.018
You promised me that
you would save him over me!

02:13:45.101 --> 02:13:49.773
You promised me! You're a liar.
You're a liar.

02:14:13.255 --> 02:14:14.673
Hey, Catnip.

02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:16.967
You're okay.

02:14:17.050 --> 02:14:18.969
You've just been
asleep for a few days.

02:14:19.052 --> 02:14:20.262
Are we home?

02:14:29.396 --> 02:14:30.522
Gale?

02:14:32.399 --> 02:14:33.567
Where's Prim?

02:14:34.067 --> 02:14:35.402
She's alive.

02:14:36.486 --> 02:14:38.780
So is your mother.
I got 'em out in time.

02:14:40.115 --> 02:14:41.575
Got them out?

02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:46.121
After The Games, they
sent in hovercrafts.

02:14:49.249 --> 02:14:51.793
And they started dropping firebombs.

02:14:56.172 --> 02:14:57.841
They're not in 12?

02:15:00.051 --> 02:15:02.012
There is no District 12.

02:15:03.597 --> 02:15:05.098
It's all gone.
