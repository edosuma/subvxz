00:20.375 --> 00:21.940
It's time.

00:25.012 --> 00:29.214
Thanksgiving has always
meant sharing the bounty

00:29.216 --> 00:30.816
of our rich land,

00:30.818 --> 00:33.217
especially turkey.

00:33.219 --> 00:36.654
But the one thing we will
not be sharing this holiday

00:36.656 --> 00:38.890
is Drumstick or Cranberry.

00:38.892 --> 00:42.927
Catherine actually personally chose
those names, didn't you, honey?

00:42.929 --> 00:45.430
- Um, yes, I did.
- Yes, she did.

00:45.432 --> 00:49.065
Help me get a few more details about these
turkeys that I can maybe give the press.

00:49.067 --> 00:51.635
Like are they gonna hit the
minibar tonight at their hotel?

00:51.637 --> 00:53.771
Well, we booked the
hotel for a few nights,

00:53.773 --> 00:56.206
but I'm taking these guys
straight to a petting zoo

00:56.208 --> 00:57.875
in Virginia after the ceremony.

00:57.877 --> 01:00.477
Oh, they can while away the rest
of their peaceful years there.

01:00.479 --> 01:02.846
Well, they were bred to be eaten,
so they'll probably collapse

01:02.848 --> 01:05.782
from their own weight and
die in a year or two, tops.

01:05.784 --> 01:09.452
Is there a more fun way to say that?

01:09.454 --> 01:12.254
With the power vested in me,

01:12.256 --> 01:16.358
I hereby declare Drumstick and Cranberry

01:16.360 --> 01:20.396
pardoned from the
Thanksgiving dinner table

01:20.398 --> 01:22.464
and also for tax evasion.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.068
There we go. Oh! Oh!

01:27.070 --> 01:29.070
I think they're trying to fly away.

01:29.072 --> 01:31.105
Ooh, these birds are filthy.

01:31.107 --> 01:34.543
- Dan.
- Hey, why have I been greened?

01:34.545 --> 01:36.778
- Will you tell our friend over here...
- Take it easy.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.613
It's just a screwup with
the security office.

01:38.615 --> 01:40.448
Someone's got a case of the
blue badge blue balls.

01:40.450 --> 01:42.583
I'm gonna assign you
to Tom James' office.

01:42.585 --> 01:45.619
They're shorthanded since we're
duking it out with Congress.

01:45.621 --> 01:47.455
I'll escort him in. He's harmless.

01:47.457 --> 01:48.889
Unless you got a sister.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.858
You looking forward to
Thanksgiving, Marjorie?

01:50.860 --> 01:53.561
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Where do you spend the holiday?

01:53.563 --> 01:55.696
- In Maryland, ma'am.
- Oh, that's where I'm from.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.330
I know, ma'am.

01:57.332 --> 01:59.532
Selina: <i>Okay, so tell Congressman Price</i>

01:59.534 --> 02:01.668
I just pardoned his stanky-ass turkeys,

02:01.670 --> 02:04.036
so I'm gonna expect him to wrap up

02:04.038 --> 02:06.070
that Missouri delegation
when the House votes, right?

02:06.095 --> 02:06.973
Well played, ma'am.

02:06.975 --> 02:09.609
Missouri's the largest
turkey-producing state in the union.

02:09.610 --> 02:11.586
Second only to Minnesota
followed by North Carolina.

02:11.611 --> 02:12.244
Ma'am.

02:12.246 --> 02:13.013
And Arkansas.

02:13.038 --> 02:15.313
Maybe I can pardon a car
with a defective airbag...

02:15.315 --> 02:16.982
...and
we can wrap up Michigan.

02:16.984 --> 02:19.317
Michigan is actually the largest
producer of battery acid.

02:19.319 --> 02:21.987
Can somebody reach around the back
of Kent's head and power him down?

02:21.989 --> 02:23.856
Oh, ma'am, latest from Treasury

02:23.858 --> 02:26.057
is housing starts are down
and unemployment's up.

02:26.059 --> 02:27.493
Any chance we can switch those?

02:27.495 --> 02:29.294
I'll turn the graphs upside down.

02:29.296 --> 02:32.530
Oh, listen, I'm not gonna need
you this weekend or tomorrow,

02:32.532 --> 02:34.966
- so you can take that off, okay?
- Oh, fantastic.

02:34.968 --> 02:37.969
My husband and I are having his
whole family over for turkey.

02:37.971 --> 02:40.104
Husband? You're married?

02:40.106 --> 02:41.806
Yes. Last year.

02:41.808 --> 02:44.609
250 people, no one from work.

02:44.611 --> 02:46.410
Catherine: <i>Mom, can I have a sec?</i>

02:46.412 --> 02:49.345
- Privately?
- Sure, honey.

02:49.347 --> 02:52.048
- What is it?
- Okay.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.584
Well, I was just gonna
go meet Dad and Monica.

02:54.586 --> 02:56.586
I was just wondering what
time you'll be arriving.

02:56.588 --> 02:59.789
Oh, honey, I can't.

02:59.791 --> 03:02.158
But it's the first Thanksgiving
since Mee-maw's gone.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.060
There's a lot to be thankful for.

03:04.062 --> 03:06.128
But we're doing a whole
dinner at her house.

03:06.130 --> 03:08.664
I mean, it... or, well, my house.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.099
God, it still sounds
so weird saying that.

03:11.101 --> 03:13.035
Yeah, it really does.

03:13.037 --> 03:14.837
But I have to be here, sweetie pie,

03:14.839 --> 03:17.172
<i>'cause I've got to call all
of these Congress people.</i>

03:17.174 --> 03:20.175
Whip the vote. You understand that.
Mommy's got to whip.

03:20.177 --> 03:22.010
- Whip it good. What is that?
- Devo.

03:22.012 --> 03:24.111
Well, can't you make those
phone calls from anywhere?

03:24.113 --> 03:26.180
- Nope, it's got to be Washington.
- Right.

03:26.182 --> 03:28.883
It makes a big difference to know
that she's calling from the Oval.

03:28.885 --> 03:30.418
But doesn't it just come up as unlisted?

03:30.420 --> 03:32.420
They're ready in the Roosevelt Room.

03:33.690 --> 03:36.558
Mom, so this is the
famous White House mess.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.892
- Oh, very nice, Joni.
- Yeah, isn't it?

03:38.894 --> 03:42.596
So this was renovated in 1951 by...

03:42.598 --> 03:44.831
hey, I'll be right back.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.199
Okay, just one second.

03:46.201 --> 03:49.069
<i>Ooh, is that the mandarin chicken salad?</i>

03:49.071 --> 03:51.504
Looks delicious. Hey,
can I see your badge?

03:51.506 --> 03:53.674
My rusty sheriff's badge?

03:53.676 --> 03:57.176
Oh, I'm sure that showing your anus gets
you into all your regular social clubs,

03:57.178 --> 03:59.478
but this is the White House
mess and to be in here,

03:59.480 --> 04:01.647
you got to have one of
these blue bad boys.

04:01.649 --> 04:03.015
Why are you doing this, Jonah?

04:03.017 --> 04:05.184
You see the picture of Grover Cleveland?

04:05.186 --> 04:06.819
Is that a tear in his eye

04:06.821 --> 04:08.888
because he knows the rules
aren't being respected?

04:08.890 --> 04:10.122
Oh, Jesus. Fuck you.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.857
Excuse me, sir. We
have an intruder here.

04:11.859 --> 04:14.325
No, we don't. You know, Jonah,

04:14.327 --> 04:16.060
I hope you die a horrible death

04:16.063 --> 04:18.930
choking on a red, glistening dog dick.

04:18.932 --> 04:22.400
- Have a lovely Thanksgiving, Mrs. Ryan.
- Oh, you, too.

04:22.402 --> 04:24.603
- Well, I'm ready if you are.
- For what?

04:24.605 --> 04:28.073
I invited Richard to come back
with us for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

04:28.075 --> 04:32.076
Mom, you don't invite my friends
to Thanksgiving dinner.

04:32.078 --> 04:34.878
I invite my friends to
Thanksgiving dinner.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.881
Richard, would you like to
come to Thanksgiving dinner?

04:39.852 --> 04:41.577
<i> Thanksgiving
wouldn't be complete...</i>

04:42.154 --> 04:43.921
Morning. Happy Thanksgiving.

04:43.923 --> 04:45.388
- Are they ready for me?
- Yeah.

04:45.390 --> 04:47.624
It's this election has
just been brutal on me.

04:47.626 --> 04:51.127
My eyelids are seriously starting to
look like Keith Richards' ball sack.

04:51.129 --> 04:54.230
- Oh, please. He wishes.
- Ma'am, Mike just announced to the press

04:54.232 --> 04:57.199
that we're closing up shop for the
Thanksgiving holiday and we're monitoring

04:57.201 --> 04:59.636
a North Korean military exercise
right now and that's about it.

04:59.638 --> 05:01.303
God, all that exercising
and Glorious Leader

05:01.305 --> 05:02.872
still can't seem to take
off a pound, right?

05:02.874 --> 05:04.606
That haircut's not doing him any favors.

05:04.608 --> 05:07.743
The South Korean PM is asking
for a few minutes to discuss.

05:07.745 --> 05:09.678
And the CDC is reporting
a few more cases

05:09.680 --> 05:12.280
of salmonella poisoning linked
to contaminated poultry.

05:12.282 --> 05:15.416
Tell the South Korean PM I'll give
her a call later this afternoon.

05:15.418 --> 05:17.786
- Right.
- After, you know. Wish me luck, though.

05:17.788 --> 05:19.354
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

05:20.857 --> 05:22.790
- Madam President.
- Dr. Abernathy.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.492
- If you could please have a seat. Gary.
- Dr. Abernathy.

05:25.494 --> 05:27.327
- You're here.
- I'm here to assist the president.

05:27.329 --> 05:29.363
Well, I think that Karen
and I can handle this.

05:29.365 --> 05:31.598
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm so sorry. How are you?

05:31.600 --> 05:34.902
I'm fine, thank you. I'm just a
little nervous, I have to confess.

05:34.904 --> 05:36.704
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

05:36.706 --> 05:38.672
You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
In fact, I usually perform

05:38.674 --> 05:40.373
things that are a bit more
complicated than a De-bagging.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.175
A De-bagging? Is that
what you just said?

05:42.177 --> 05:43.576
I thought you said tea-bagging.

05:43.578 --> 05:45.712
No, no, no. That's my department.

05:45.714 --> 05:48.915
He means that literally. He doesn't
know what the other thing is.

05:48.917 --> 05:53.319
Anyway, listen, can you just talk me
through this procedure one more time?

05:53.321 --> 05:56.855
It's quite simple. I actually don't have
to make any cuts to the exterior dermis.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.324
It's all approached internally
from behind the eyelid.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.728
There's gonna be a little swelling and of
course a tiny bit of bruising afterwards.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.197
- Ooh, bruising?
- Yes, Gary, bruising.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.532
That's when a little blood
collects underneath the skin.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.668
It's not a problem for an actual doctor.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.336
Now, the beauty of this procedure

06:11.338 --> 06:13.237
is that we can do it today and
you'll be healed by Monday.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.872
And I'll look 10 years younger.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.207
That would make you a baby.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.142
- Okay, it's...
- Shall we get started?

06:18.144 --> 06:21.179
- Okay. Yeah.
- Gary, if you'll please excuse us.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.347
It's very easy for me
just to sit right there.

06:23.349 --> 06:24.916
- I've got it.
- Easy.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.487
<i> Officials are reporting
a salmonella outbreak...</i>

06:29.512 --> 06:30.320
<i> You seeing this?</i>

06:30.322 --> 06:34.124
...that has led to 37
hospitalizations in four states.

06:34.126 --> 06:36.459
POTUS is still getting
permanently Photoshopped.

06:36.461 --> 06:39.763
Let's get the head of the CDC
out there, calm everyone down.

06:39.765 --> 06:43.166
Let's send Tom James out as well.
He's a tall drink of Xanax.

06:43.168 --> 06:45.045
The number of people
taken ill is orders

06:45.070 --> 06:46.836
of magnitude below
statistical significance.

06:46.838 --> 06:49.872
Do people not understand basic
nonparametric statistics?

06:49.874 --> 06:51.607
Or how to cook a fucking turkey.

06:51.609 --> 06:54.110
Oh, sir, you're here now. Good.

06:54.112 --> 06:57.479
- So Ben told me that apparently...
- We're being deployed.

06:57.481 --> 06:59.481
Operation Calm the Fuck Down.

06:59.483 --> 07:01.383
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Come on in.

07:01.385 --> 07:03.618
<i> Just the guy I wanted to see.</i>

07:03.620 --> 07:05.854
Ooh, uh-oh. I know that number.

07:05.856 --> 07:07.756
The number of the beast Sidney Purcell.

07:07.758 --> 07:10.024
I don't know why he keeps calling me.

07:10.026 --> 07:11.826
His comprehension of the word no

07:11.828 --> 07:15.196
hovers somewhere around drunk
college quarterback level.

07:15.198 --> 07:17.799
But anyway, sir, how can I help you?

07:17.801 --> 07:19.600
Got a little something for you.

07:19.602 --> 07:21.835
Carol in personnel owed me a favor.

07:21.837 --> 07:26.373
Oh, this is gonna wipe that crooked
smile off Jonah Ryan's face.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.208
I think that's genetic.

07:28.210 --> 07:31.145
You know, Egan, I work a little
differently than the president.

07:31.147 --> 07:33.680
As far as treating my
staff, I try not to act

07:33.682 --> 07:36.650
like an alcoholic father who
has just stepped on a Lego.

07:36.652 --> 07:38.517
<i>I value openness and straight talk.</i>

07:38.519 --> 07:40.253
You're part of the James team now.

07:40.255 --> 07:42.255
- <i>Part of my inner circle.</i>
- I'm honored.

07:42.257 --> 07:45.091
So raise your right hand
and repeat the oath.

07:46.627 --> 07:48.995
I'm fucking with you. Come on, let's go.

07:48.997 --> 07:50.663
That's very good, sir.

07:50.665 --> 07:52.899
- Mike! Mike!
- Mike, is this a salmonella epidemic?

07:52.901 --> 07:54.266
Is the president going
to make a statement?

07:54.268 --> 07:57.002
She will be making a
full statement soon...

07:57.004 --> 08:00.272
sooner than you think, but
only when she's ready.

08:00.274 --> 08:02.808
Right now, though, I'd like to
bring up Dr. Robert Weinberg

08:02.810 --> 08:05.877
from the Centers for Disease Control.
Dr. Weinberg.

08:08.648 --> 08:10.682
- This is not good.
- It's fine.

08:10.684 --> 08:12.983
Everybody's watching football.
There's only a couple cases.

08:12.985 --> 08:14.785
No, Wendy's pissed.

08:14.787 --> 08:17.988
I left her at home with her folks
and my folks plus her kids.

08:17.990 --> 08:21.358
Shit, I don't even know
who's at my house.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.928
I don't even know if they're in town.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.063
I hate to admit it, but sometimes

08:26.065 --> 08:28.397
I'm scared of Wendy.

08:28.399 --> 08:30.533
She still has a great rack, though.

08:32.236 --> 08:34.871
- What do you think?
- Oh, yeah. You did great, ma'am.

08:34.873 --> 08:36.905
- Oh, good.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

08:36.908 --> 08:40.309
- Hi, guys.
<i>- Doesn't she look amazing?</i>

08:40.312 --> 08:41.878
Jesus, you look like
a southern housewife

08:41.880 --> 08:43.412
who just burned her husband's dinner.

08:43.414 --> 08:46.114
Ma'am, the salmonella
outbreak has mushroomed.

08:46.116 --> 08:47.983
The cases now number over 200.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.018
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

08:50.020 --> 08:52.520
- Should I make a statement?
- No, that's not a good idea.

08:52.522 --> 08:56.258
No one should see you while
your face is... marinating.

08:56.260 --> 08:59.594
Okay, she just had 10
years taken off her eyes.

08:59.596 --> 09:01.463
- Yes.
<i>- Well, I don't think they left yet.</i>

09:01.465 --> 09:04.232
You just stay hidden, okay?
Doctor's orders, right?

09:04.234 --> 09:07.401
What are you asking him for?
He's not a doctor.

09:07.403 --> 09:11.305
I mean, he doesn't have any academic
qualifications to speak of.

09:11.307 --> 09:13.207
Well, I have a bachelor's
degree in hotel management

09:13.209 --> 09:15.209
- from Cornell University.
- No, you don't.

09:15.211 --> 09:17.979
Maybe we should ask the vice
president to make a statement.

09:17.981 --> 09:21.414
No! He's the old face
of this administration.

09:21.416 --> 09:25.051
- This is the new face.
- It's a beautiful face.

09:25.053 --> 09:26.119
Well, you know...

09:26.121 --> 09:28.288
So may we go ahead and ask Doyle?

09:28.290 --> 09:30.456
All right, fine. Ow!

09:30.458 --> 09:31.724
- Whoa.
- Aw.

09:31.726 --> 09:34.494
It really hurts to roll my eyes.

09:34.496 --> 09:36.728
Okay, yes, ask Doyle.

09:36.730 --> 09:38.563
<i>But don't tell him why.</i>

09:38.565 --> 09:41.233
- Wow.
- It's okay. It's okay.

09:41.235 --> 09:43.335
Please don't keep touching me every day.

09:44.805 --> 09:46.105
The first ever Thanksgiving,

09:46.107 --> 09:47.472
there was actually no turkey at all.

09:47.474 --> 09:48.874
- Did you know that?
- Fascinating.

09:48.876 --> 09:50.376
The pilgrims, they ate deer

09:50.378 --> 09:53.211
and harvest vegetables
like corn, zucchini.

09:53.213 --> 09:55.246
They yelled at Grandpa, obviously.

09:55.248 --> 09:57.982
- Of course.
- Some truths are eternal, but no turkey.

09:57.984 --> 09:59.683
- Thank you, Senator.
- You're welcome.

09:59.685 --> 10:01.953
Happy Thanksgiving and early Hanukkah.

10:01.955 --> 10:04.355
<i>Yes. We will be right back
after this short break.</i>

10:04.357 --> 10:06.391
<i>- And we're clear.</i>
- I love the Hanukkah bit.

10:06.393 --> 10:08.859
Good. I'm jonesing for a cup of coffee.

10:08.861 --> 10:12.762
I mean sell my sweet white ass
on a street corner jonesing.

10:12.764 --> 10:14.064
Yeah, tell me about it.

10:16.735 --> 10:18.902
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah.

10:18.904 --> 10:22.739
Also one cream, splash of
half-and-half, one sugar, one Splenda.

10:22.741 --> 10:25.008
If that's not too much trouble.

10:25.010 --> 10:28.010
- Not at all. I'm...
- Egan to please.

10:28.012 --> 10:29.412
Ben: <i>Mr. Vice President.</i>

10:29.414 --> 10:31.780
Ben, I would have you to
the table, but my wife,

10:31.782 --> 10:34.350
she fucking hates you as do I.

10:34.352 --> 10:37.219
And we had to throw the
turkey in the trash.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.754
That's why I'm here.

10:38.756 --> 10:41.223
We need you to make a statement
about the salmonella outbreak.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.192
Oh, why doesn't the president make it?

10:43.194 --> 10:45.060
Her mouth is swollen
from dental surgery.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.562
- She can't make a statement.
- You're fucking kidding me.

10:47.564 --> 10:51.299
Why wasn't I informed? You know there's
a system in place for this eventuality?

10:51.301 --> 10:53.668
It falls between the
24th and 26th Amendment.

10:53.670 --> 10:56.237
She hasn't been sedated.
She's not incapacitated.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.039
So there was no need to invoke the 25th.

10:58.041 --> 11:00.442
Well, if she's not incapacitated,
you don't need me.

11:00.444 --> 11:02.109
She's not not incapacitated.

11:02.111 --> 11:05.179
She's just not fully capacitated.

11:05.181 --> 11:07.982
You fucking people.

11:07.984 --> 11:11.385
I mean, you treat the Constitution
like a build-your-own-pizza menu.

11:11.387 --> 11:13.220
Sir, you're calm, you're confident,

11:13.222 --> 11:15.189
you exude a crotchety gravitas.

11:15.191 --> 11:18.391
We need to shut this down like a
fucking public school for the arts.

11:18.393 --> 11:20.426
Doyle: <i>So I've spoken to the president.</i>

11:20.428 --> 11:23.296
She's up to date with the situation,
which we think is under control.

11:23.298 --> 11:24.198
Yeah, Jeff?

11:24.223 --> 11:26.899
How do you feel about
the term Turkeypocalypse?

11:26.901 --> 11:29.469
I think that's a term
invented by the media.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.438
It's idiotic, but it scares people
into watching more news, right?

11:32.440 --> 11:34.907
- This is amazing.
- Yeah, he's doing okay.

11:34.909 --> 11:38.477
No, I got an email from
that surrogate we met with.

11:38.479 --> 11:41.713
She's on board. We're putting
a baby in her.

11:41.715 --> 11:44.116
Jesus, Mike. I'm gonna put a baby in you

11:44.118 --> 11:45.984
- if you don't get your head in the game.
- Sorry.

11:45.986 --> 11:47.986
- Where is the president?
- James, do me a favor.

11:47.988 --> 11:49.754
Next time you have a
root canal, remind me.

11:49.756 --> 11:52.356
I'll come and pester you to be
back at your desk in an hour.

11:52.358 --> 11:54.291
Christ, I thought he was
gonna shit the bed.

11:54.293 --> 11:57.261
Instead he's doing turndown service
and leaving a mint on the pillow.

11:57.263 --> 12:00.931
You know, that can be the difference
between a three- and a four-star hotel.

12:02.135 --> 12:04.001
All right, who's up first?

12:04.003 --> 12:07.405
We've got Congressman Jaeger.
He's from Wisconsin.

12:07.407 --> 12:09.382
Is he the one with the
prostitute problem?

12:09.407 --> 12:10.040
Mmm...

12:10.042 --> 12:11.641
Oh, never mind. They all have that.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.676
House is like Caligula's room.

12:13.678 --> 12:15.960
Okay, well, you got the...
that's a five.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.047
Yeah, I got it.

12:17.049 --> 12:18.681
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Happy Thanksgiving.

12:18.683 --> 12:21.817
This is the president calling.
Is Congressman Jaeger available?

12:21.819 --> 12:24.154
-<i> Oh, sure. Let me get him.</i>
- Thank you.

12:24.156 --> 12:25.688
See? President calling herself.

12:25.690 --> 12:27.056
That's gotta be very impressive.

12:27.058 --> 12:29.425
I would die.

12:29.427 --> 12:31.160
Jaeger: <i>Yes, Madam President, hello.</i>

12:31.162 --> 12:33.295
Selina: <i>Congressman Jaeger, how are you?</i>

12:33.297 --> 12:36.031
Well, to be honest, the holidays
are a little tough on our family.

12:36.033 --> 12:38.300
My wife and I are trying
to work some things out.

12:38.302 --> 12:40.269
- Prostitutes.
- Mm-hmm.

12:40.271 --> 12:43.271
So I'm sure that you know why
I'm calling, Congressman.

12:43.273 --> 12:45.506
<i>Of course. The salmonella outbreak.</i>

12:45.508 --> 12:47.241
Ma'am, have you considered
making a statement?

12:47.243 --> 12:49.510
If I have learned one thing
about crisis management,

12:49.512 --> 12:52.180
it's that you've got to get out there
and talk to the American people.

12:52.182 --> 12:55.816
If they hear it from you directly, you
can get away with just about anything.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.651
Bordello Bill is giving me advice.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.853
Maybe you should declare
a state of emergency.

12:59.855 --> 13:03.123
- Are you able to do that?
-<i> Yeah, but unfortunately, I have to run.</i>

13:03.125 --> 13:05.725
<i>I hope I can count on your
support in the upcoming vote.</i>

13:05.727 --> 13:08.061
Happy Thanksgiving. Bye-bye. Oh, my God.

13:08.063 --> 13:09.963
How many more of these do we have to do?

13:09.965 --> 13:11.698
Okay, we've got Congressman Coffey.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.367
Coffey. Where does he stick his dick?

13:14.369 --> 13:16.703
Here's the statement from
Health and Human Services.

13:16.705 --> 13:19.238
Hey, do you guys know a luxurious
but super cheap hotel?

13:19.240 --> 13:20.272
Yeah, in the Philippines.

13:20.274 --> 13:22.341
Another 60 cases being reported

13:22.343 --> 13:25.478
including New Hampshire
Congressman Harry Sherman.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.813
Jeez, he couldn't eat a turkey
unless you put it in a blender

13:27.815 --> 13:29.215
and fed it to him through a straw.

13:29.217 --> 13:30.916
Wait, the turkeys have
a hotel room, right?

13:30.918 --> 13:33.885
Yes. We better go see
the black-eyed pea.

13:33.887 --> 13:35.886
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Big news, babe.

13:35.888 --> 13:38.490
Our surrogate Debralee is a go.

13:38.492 --> 13:40.225
Praise Jesus! Are you kidding me?

13:40.227 --> 13:42.760
We got to celebrate. Afternoon quickie.

13:42.762 --> 13:44.629
Where? In the basement?

13:44.631 --> 13:46.431
Not this time. Big Mike has a surprise.

13:46.433 --> 13:48.199
I got us a suite at the Willard.

13:48.201 --> 13:51.968
I'll text you the... no, I'll
sext you the room number.

13:53.672 --> 13:55.005
Any news on Sherman?

13:55.007 --> 13:56.806
CNN and Fox both say he's critical,

13:56.808 --> 13:59.743
but Fox says it with blonder
hair and bigger tits.

13:59.745 --> 14:02.312
What is this? Is that lint?

14:02.314 --> 14:05.315
- You got one of those...
- Yeah, lint brush. Sure, right here.

14:10.054 --> 14:11.820
That is amazing.

14:11.822 --> 14:13.856
Can I trouble you for
another cup of coffee?

14:13.858 --> 14:16.592
- I'm running on fumes.
- I'm your man.

14:17.795 --> 14:20.029
And one cream.

14:20.031 --> 14:21.964
Splash of half-and-half.

14:21.966 --> 14:25.067
One sugar and one Splenda.

14:32.676 --> 14:34.142
Fuck me.

14:34.144 --> 14:35.910
Selina: <i>Yes, Congressman,</i>

14:35.912 --> 14:38.079
the vice president is certainly the...

14:38.081 --> 14:40.148
the president that never was.

14:40.150 --> 14:43.050
You know what, actually? I'm gonna
have to call you back, Congressman.

14:43.052 --> 14:46.453
Thank you so much. Happy Thanksgiving.
Yes. What?

14:46.455 --> 14:47.954
Sherman's dead.

14:47.956 --> 14:49.856
Ow! Oh, my God, that hurts so much.

14:49.858 --> 14:51.762
Please don't surprise
me like that again.

14:51.787 --> 14:52.759
We just got word.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.229
Why couldn't he have waited
until after the weekend?

14:55.231 --> 14:58.365
Well, in many ways, this could be
the best thing that could happen.

14:58.367 --> 14:59.067
Say what, now?

14:59.092 --> 15:01.167
We just lost the oldest
member of the House

15:01.169 --> 15:04.136
and our president can't make a statement
without a paper bag on her head.

15:04.138 --> 15:07.440
You're missing the big picture.
Sherman was an O'Brien diehard.

15:07.442 --> 15:11.110
That's one less vote for O'Brien
and possibly one vote for us

15:11.112 --> 15:13.112
if they can hold a special
election in time.

15:13.114 --> 15:15.515
New Hampshire could
give us the presidency.

15:15.517 --> 15:17.849
If I had known that, I would
have killed him myself.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.951
Jonah's Uncle Jeff is flying down.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.221
He's still the kingmaker
in New Hampshire.

15:22.223 --> 15:24.298
God, he is such, like,
a little man, isn't he?

15:24.323 --> 15:24.989
He is.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.592
- Fuck!
- What?

15:26.594 --> 15:28.727
O'Brien is offering
condolences to the widow.

15:28.729 --> 15:30.929
We got to get somebody to say
something about Sherman.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.098
Not Doyle. Anyone but the veep.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.799
- We got to lance that Doyle.
- No promises, ma'am.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.067
- What?
- No promises.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.936
Come on.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.506
- What is that?
- It's your Thanksgiving meal.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.276
Why are there two place settings? You
know Charlie's not coming, right?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.713
I do. That was just for in case you
wanted someone to sit with you.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.715
Not to eat, just to talk.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.416
Or be quiet.

15:53.418 --> 15:55.318
- I'm not hungry.
- Me neither.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.787
<i>- You again?</i>
<i>- Sherman's dead.</i>

15:57.789 --> 15:59.256
We need you to make another statement.

15:59.258 --> 16:02.259
What is dental surgery
code for anyway, Ben?

16:02.261 --> 16:04.127
I mean, is it like anal bleaching?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.529
Because if it is, you should
just come out and say that

16:06.531 --> 16:09.265
because the American people,
they'll accept it in time.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.967
To be honest with you, sir,
she's not looking real good.

16:11.969 --> 16:15.604
And I'll be honest with you. I don't think
you're being honest about being honest.

16:15.606 --> 16:18.840
So you know what? I want
to see the president.

16:18.842 --> 16:20.976
- That won't be necessary.
- No more messengers, Ben.

16:20.978 --> 16:22.645
If she wants me to do her bullshit,

16:22.647 --> 16:26.347
she can tell me out of her
own shining white asshole.

16:26.349 --> 16:30.585
Today's media-go-round
was a tour De force.

16:30.587 --> 16:32.553
More like a waste De time.

16:32.555 --> 16:34.221
Well, maybe you thought I was too busy

16:34.223 --> 16:36.557
sorting through your junk
mail folder to realize

16:36.559 --> 16:41.162
you mentioned things like zucchini
and Atlantic City and Pfizer,

16:41.164 --> 16:44.964
all clients, of course, of Sidney
"Why is That Guy Calling Me" Purcell.

16:44.966 --> 16:48.134
I used a lot of other words, too.

16:48.136 --> 16:52.906
I'm pretty sure I said
"be" and also "careful."

16:54.376 --> 16:57.243
I don't know what your
endgame is, but I want in.

16:57.245 --> 16:59.745
I will bring you back human
ears for a necklace.

16:59.747 --> 17:01.213
I am your guy.

17:02.550 --> 17:06.285
Didn't you have, like,
a nervous breakdown?

17:06.287 --> 17:08.654
- You had a nervous breakdown, right?
- It was not a breakdown.

17:08.656 --> 17:11.357
It was just more a little bit
of psychological indigestion.

17:11.358 --> 17:13.592
You just got back from Nevada
and you lost the recount.

17:13.594 --> 17:15.194
It's got to be a pretty stressful time.

17:15.195 --> 17:17.228
<i>Seems to me like you're spinning out.</i>

17:17.230 --> 17:19.896
At least that's what I'm
gonna have to tell everyone.

17:19.898 --> 17:21.633
Which would be a shame.

17:23.569 --> 17:25.936
You're right. I don't even know
what we were talking about.

17:25.939 --> 17:28.138
We're talking about
your mental state, Dan.

17:30.877 --> 17:32.743
Your lips are looking a little dry.

17:32.745 --> 17:35.446
- I just want to see if I have that balm.
- Oh, goodie.

17:35.448 --> 17:38.549
Kent: <i>Ben is bringing over
Vice President Doyle.</i>

17:38.551 --> 17:39.850
<i>He insisted on seeing you.</i>

17:39.852 --> 17:43.354
Forgive me, but you
have to be nice to him.

17:43.356 --> 17:45.255
What? I know that.

17:45.257 --> 17:47.958
Why is everybody always
telling me to be nice?

17:47.960 --> 17:50.360
All right? It is... oh, here.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.798
- Jesus Horatio Christ.
- Andrew.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.742
Wow.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.569
Needless to say, I did
not have root canal.

17:59.571 --> 18:02.605
Thanks, guys. I got it.
Come, sit down, please.

18:02.607 --> 18:05.842
Can I just say how much I appreciate

18:05.844 --> 18:08.377
your coming down on your Thanksgiving

18:08.379 --> 18:10.379
and giving it up to come here?
Thank you.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.347
Sherman may have been from
the other side of the aisle,

18:12.349 --> 18:13.749
but he's a decent guy

18:13.751 --> 18:16.117
even though he still
used the word coloreds.

18:16.119 --> 18:18.152
Oh, well, nobody's perfect, right?

18:18.154 --> 18:19.954
You can cut the shit, Selina.

18:19.956 --> 18:22.190
I have barely seen you for two months.

18:22.192 --> 18:24.324
- Well, apologies about that.
- Okay.

18:24.326 --> 18:28.028
Listen, I will go out there
with my golden boy smile,

18:28.030 --> 18:30.264
- give 'em the Doyle dazzle.
- Okay.

18:30.266 --> 18:32.032
But there's something I want in return.

18:32.034 --> 18:34.468
I want to be considered
for Secretary of State.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.741
It's the job I've always wanted.

18:41.743 --> 18:45.278
Hughes said that he would give it
to me if he won a second term.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.481
And he also said he'd
kick you off the ticket.

18:48.483 --> 18:52.419
See, there's that Doyle dazzle
and I'm a big fan of it.

18:54.689 --> 18:57.489
Andrew, I'm a woman of my word

18:57.491 --> 18:59.357
and you have my word.

18:59.359 --> 19:01.026
Fair enough.

19:01.028 --> 19:03.462
- Okay, good. All right.
- Say, did Ben do this to you?

19:03.464 --> 19:05.764
Because I can get you to a shelter.

19:05.766 --> 19:08.500
- That's so funny.
- Seriously, I know he says he loves you,

19:08.502 --> 19:11.069
but if you don't press charges,
he's gonna kill you someday.

19:11.071 --> 19:14.605
I love it. Domestic abuse jokes.
They just tickle me.

19:16.876 --> 19:20.545
As most of you already know, Congressman
Harry Sherman passed away today

19:20.547 --> 19:24.114
in a hospital near his home in his
beloved state of New Hampshire.

19:24.116 --> 19:27.685
Hey, I've got something for
you guys, something big.

19:27.687 --> 19:30.922
I think Tom is up to something
with Sidney Purcell.

19:30.924 --> 19:32.121
Up to what?

19:32.123 --> 19:33.623
At each of today's programs,

19:33.625 --> 19:35.291
he mentioned one of Purcell's clients.

19:35.293 --> 19:38.094
I mean, zucchini, Pfizer, farmed salmon.

19:38.096 --> 19:40.964
- Tom is not that stupid.
- There's a clear pattern.

19:40.966 --> 19:43.500
And I noticed it, so I confronted
him with the evidence.

19:43.502 --> 19:46.169
- And?
- And he said that I was crazy.

19:46.171 --> 19:48.438
- You know what it could be?
- What?

19:48.440 --> 19:50.405
That you are fucking crazy.

19:50.407 --> 19:52.842
You were foaming at the
mouth during the election.

19:52.844 --> 19:55.611
Tom James.

19:55.613 --> 19:57.212
It was a fucking panic attack.

19:57.214 --> 20:00.115
Tom James.

20:00.117 --> 20:01.784
Goddamn panic attack.

20:01.786 --> 20:03.686
You know it was a fucking panic attack.

20:03.688 --> 20:04.887
Kent: <i>Well done.</i>

20:04.889 --> 20:08.189
Congratulations, Mrs. McLintock.

20:08.191 --> 20:10.959
Listen, baby, I have
some giblets simmering

20:10.961 --> 20:14.295
and five really hungry people, so I'm
gonna need you to be really quick.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.998
No problem. Fastest gun in DC.

20:19.068 --> 20:20.468
Do you smell something?

20:20.470 --> 20:23.770
No, nothing. Just the whiff of romance.

20:23.772 --> 20:25.761
No, I smell something.
You don't smell anything?

20:25.786 --> 20:26.573
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

20:26.575 --> 20:29.175
Amy's dad: <i>So what is
this Tom James guy like?</i>

20:29.177 --> 20:31.411
- Is he tall?
- I should get back to work.

20:31.413 --> 20:33.981
- The president needs me.
- Well, you just got here.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.717
Why don't you tell me about Vegas?
Did you two girls have fun?

20:36.719 --> 20:38.685
Well, one of us did,

20:38.687 --> 20:41.621
but what happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas.

20:41.623 --> 20:44.690
Jesus, for the final
time, it was not Vegas!

20:44.692 --> 20:47.026
Amy, please don't swear like
that in front of the kids.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.360
I'll get it.

20:48.362 --> 20:50.563
Do not make me call your fathers.

20:50.565 --> 20:52.698
What the fuck? You're not
answering your phone?

20:52.700 --> 20:55.134
- My family hid it.
- Look, I've got to run something by you.

20:55.136 --> 20:57.969
I fully support your decision
to live as an ugly woman.

20:57.971 --> 20:59.571
- Amy's mom: <i>Who's there, honey?</i>
- Just Dan.

20:59.573 --> 21:01.205
<i>Oh, good. Bring him in.</i>

21:01.207 --> 21:03.408
- <i>It's Thanksgiving.</i>
- Please don't make me.

21:03.410 --> 21:05.644
Jeff: <i>I spoke to the governor.</i>

21:05.646 --> 21:07.311
New Hampshire is gonna
hold a special election

21:07.313 --> 21:09.080
for the seat before Christmas.

21:09.082 --> 21:11.082
-<i> But...</i>
- Sounds like a big goddamn but.

21:11.084 --> 21:15.953
Oh, yeah, this is a giant, juicy,
muscular Serena Williams but.

21:15.955 --> 21:18.388
Sherman's widow is about to announce

21:18.390 --> 21:19.890
that she is running for the seat.

21:19.892 --> 21:22.092
I have recurring nightmares

21:22.094 --> 21:23.794
about running against widows.

21:23.796 --> 21:25.462
We've got a list of vetted names here.

21:25.464 --> 21:27.330
Great, why don't you send
them right over to me?

21:27.332 --> 21:29.266
- I'm running low on toilet paper.
- Excuse me?

21:29.268 --> 21:32.569
You don't give me names, Beardo.
I give you names.

21:32.571 --> 21:34.737
So take your list, roll it up real tiny,

21:34.739 --> 21:36.606
attach it to the leg
of a carrier pigeon,

21:36.608 --> 21:38.207
and have it fly up tubby's dick.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.676
So who's your choice?

21:39.678 --> 21:41.744
You know I'm grooming my nephew Ezra.

21:41.746 --> 21:43.512
Heard a lot of great things about Ezra.

21:43.514 --> 21:46.248
Brilliant, handsome,
wife's a solid eight.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.016
After kids, probably still be a seven.

21:48.018 --> 21:50.852
Mark my words, he will
be president someday.

21:50.854 --> 21:54.122
But Ezra's currently
serving in Afghanistan.

21:54.124 --> 21:57.059
Besides, for anyone to beat the widow,
they're gonna have to fight dirty

21:57.061 --> 21:59.160
- and I don't shit where I eat.
- Well, me neither,

21:59.162 --> 22:01.597
not since my wife caught me
eating yogurt on the crapper.

22:01.599 --> 22:04.199
We need a real piece
of cannon fodder here,

22:04.201 --> 22:06.200
some spectacular dumbass

22:06.202 --> 22:08.402
willing to charge this machine gun nest,

22:08.404 --> 22:10.471
sacrifice his name and reputation,

22:10.473 --> 22:12.873
and then fuck off so
Ezra can slide right in.

22:12.875 --> 22:16.343
So do you have a list of
spectacular dumbasses?

22:16.345 --> 22:19.046
There's only one name on it.

22:19.048 --> 22:21.381
<i> For my family back in
Connecticut, we ditched the turkey.</i>

22:21.383 --> 22:23.483
That's because I have a special recipe

22:23.485 --> 22:25.652
for farmed salmon with
a side of zucchini.

22:25.654 --> 22:27.988
- See? They're both clients.
- Well, what does it mean?

22:27.990 --> 22:30.757
- I don't know.
- He doesn't know. Why would he know?

22:30.759 --> 22:34.560
So for dessert, there's apple and
pecan pie. What would you like?

22:34.562 --> 22:36.696
You know, I would love
a little bit of both.

22:36.698 --> 22:38.764
Oh, you want both, do you?

22:38.766 --> 22:39.691
Yeah, why not?

22:39.716 --> 22:42.467
I'll tell you why not,
you shit sack Casanova.

22:42.469 --> 22:44.737
You have had sex with
both of my daughters.

22:44.739 --> 22:48.040
I mean, have you no shame? Wait a
minute, sweetie, I just figured it out.

22:48.042 --> 22:50.575
You know what it is? You want to
fuck my wife, too, don't you?

22:50.577 --> 22:52.878
- Good night, Brookheimers.
- Bye, Dan.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.446
<i>- Sorry.</i>

22:54.448 --> 22:57.849
Mrs. Ryan, these old Thanksgiving
photos are priceless.

22:57.851 --> 23:01.119
- Oh.
- Wow, that is some overbite.

23:01.121 --> 23:02.353
It's like a wererabbit.

23:02.355 --> 23:03.888
Well, I was advanced for my age.

23:03.890 --> 23:05.657
I had all my adult teeth by age four.

23:05.659 --> 23:07.859
I didn't know children still
wore leashes at this age.

23:07.861 --> 23:09.761
- Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
<i>- Okay, Jeff.</i>

23:09.763 --> 23:12.163
I should tell you that there's not
enough white meat to go around.

23:12.165 --> 23:13.964
- I don't want a repeat of '79.
- Whatever.

23:13.966 --> 23:16.700
Listen, the reason I'm here...
now that Sherman is dead,

23:16.702 --> 23:20.671
there is going to be a special
election back home for the seat and...

23:20.673 --> 23:25.075
Oh, you want me to canvass for
Cousin Ezra the war hero?

23:25.077 --> 23:27.577
No, I want you to run.

23:28.747 --> 23:30.680
You want me to run his campaign?

23:30.682 --> 23:34.650
No, Jonah, I want you
to run for the seat.

23:44.862 --> 23:46.395
Joni?

23:46.397 --> 23:49.731
Dear Lord who guides
me and nourishes me,

23:49.733 --> 23:52.600
I set foot on this path that
you have laid before me

23:52.602 --> 23:55.103
with a strong arm and a willing heart

23:55.105 --> 23:57.972
to totally rock this shit. Amen.

23:59.409 --> 24:02.110
The Jonah Ryan story, chapter five.

24:02.112 --> 24:04.812
The House kneels before
the fucking J-man.

24:04.814 --> 24:06.279
I'm running for Congress!

24:06.281 --> 24:07.781
Oh, my God, that's great.

24:07.783 --> 24:09.683
Actual Congress or some
fantasy league Congress?

24:09.685 --> 24:11.118
Of course, up against the Widow Sherman,

24:11.120 --> 24:12.652
it's gonna be like climbing Mt. McKinley

24:12.654 --> 24:14.454
with your balls stapled to a piano.

24:14.456 --> 24:16.456
She's got my vote, bless her heart.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.592
Ain't a challenge been
invented Jonah Ryan can't do.

24:18.594 --> 24:20.060
Ice bucket challenge.
You backed out of that.

24:20.062 --> 24:21.894
Ice bucket challenge can suck my dick.

24:21.896 --> 24:24.197
Well, it did raise a lot of
awareness for whatever ALS is.

24:24.199 --> 24:26.699
- Who is this man?
- Richard Splett.

24:26.701 --> 24:28.334
- Splett?
- Splett.

24:28.336 --> 24:31.003
Yeah, okay. This is just
for one term here, Jonah.

24:31.005 --> 24:34.506
You're merely acting as
a placeholder for Ezra.

24:34.508 --> 24:36.109
Once I'm in, I'm in.

24:36.111 --> 24:38.476
I went to the White House
on a three-week placement.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.446
I'm a MRSA infection. You
don't get rid of Jonah Ryan.

24:41.448 --> 24:45.016
Listen to me, all right? I'm not
asking you, I am telling you.

24:45.018 --> 24:48.486
Yeah, but it's not my fault if Cousin
Lezra ends up eating my nut dust

24:48.488 --> 24:51.890
and becoming the goofy Paul Simon
to my angelic-voiced Art Garfunkel.

24:51.892 --> 24:53.943
Can I talk to you down
here just a minute?

24:53.968 --> 24:54.626
Yeah.

24:54.628 --> 24:56.560
Now listen to me, you walking trisomy.

24:56.562 --> 24:59.529
I could get dog shit in a condom
elected in New Hampshire.

24:59.531 --> 25:02.133
You are my puppet. I'd let you dance.

25:02.135 --> 25:05.202
And when I stuff you back in
the toy box to let Ezra lead,

25:05.204 --> 25:08.906
you will be grateful I ever let your
wooden painted face take the stage.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.775
Now, do you or do you
not understand me?!

25:11.777 --> 25:14.978
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Yeah.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.612
- Jeff. Jeff.
- Hey, leave it.

25:16.614 --> 25:18.547
I don't want you screaming at Joni.

25:18.549 --> 25:21.350
Congratulations, sir. May I be
the first to join your campaign?

25:21.352 --> 25:24.254
- Absolutely, chief of staff.
- Please let me earn it.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.855
There will be a vetting process.

25:29.326 --> 25:33.162
Okay, I'll just take a few questions
first, then I'll bring you up again, okay?

25:33.164 --> 25:34.396
- All right.
- Okay.

25:34.398 --> 25:36.331
Oh, hey, is it possible
to get salmonella

25:36.333 --> 25:39.401
if you were to make
love in a turkey's bed?

25:39.403 --> 25:40.345
I'm sorry?

25:40.370 --> 25:43.172
I should add the turkeys
were no longer there.

25:43.174 --> 25:45.307
Never mind. I'll be back.

25:45.309 --> 25:48.542
- Mike! Mike! Mike!
- You wanted to see me, ma'am?

25:48.544 --> 25:50.644
How'd it go with the New
Hampshire Napoleon?

25:50.646 --> 25:53.514
- He's got a lot of ideas.
- Yeah? Good.

25:53.516 --> 25:55.516
Oh, my God. Would you look at this?

25:55.518 --> 25:58.019
Reporter: <i>Mike, why won't
she give a statement?</i>

25:58.021 --> 26:00.054
Somewhere in the world there's
a woman exactly my age

26:00.056 --> 26:02.589
getting her pussy eaten and
I'm stuck here watching this.

26:02.591 --> 26:04.324
God, I've got to get out there.

26:08.864 --> 26:11.898
When Admiral Burger first
suggested this trip,

26:11.900 --> 26:14.400
it seemed like a very small sacrifice

26:14.402 --> 26:16.636
to forgo a traditional Thanksgiving

26:16.638 --> 26:19.105
with my beloved daughter Catherine

26:19.107 --> 26:20.840
and travel here to be with

26:20.842 --> 26:24.109
our brave sailors and Marines.

26:24.111 --> 26:26.712
Ooh-rah!

26:26.714 --> 26:28.247
<i>And, ladies and gentlemen of the press,</i>

26:28.249 --> 26:30.149
I want to thank you for
your understanding

26:30.151 --> 26:32.751
as to the secrecy of this trip

26:32.753 --> 26:36.288
and why I've had to be incommunicado
for the last few days.

26:36.290 --> 26:40.424
I also want to take this opportunity
to introduce Congressman Bill Jaeger

26:40.426 --> 26:43.261
<i>from the first district in the
great state of Wisconsin.</i>

26:43.263 --> 26:45.864
- They're ready for you, ma'am.
- How was your Thanksgiving, Marjorie?

26:45.866 --> 26:48.799
- It was nice, ma'am.
- Where were you?

26:48.801 --> 26:51.802
- Maryland, ma'am.
- Oh, that's where I'm from.

26:51.804 --> 26:53.571
I know, ma'am.

26:53.573 --> 26:55.572
Okay.

26:55.574 --> 26:57.374
- What?
- What just happened?

26:57.376 --> 27:00.043
- I can't even look at her.
- Yeah.

27:00.045 --> 27:02.545
All right, who's ready for
some piping hot tofurkey?

27:02.547 --> 27:03.349
Where are the tongs?

27:03.374 --> 27:05.715
Ma'am, I'll be happy to
hold your sunglasses for you.

27:05.717 --> 27:07.084
Oh, no, no, I'm good.

27:07.086 --> 27:09.853
That's tofurkey. It's made from...

27:09.855 --> 27:13.055
- Wheat, protein, organic tofu.
- ...wheat, protein, and organic tofu.

27:13.057 --> 27:15.224
- There you go.
- We're gonna have a mutiny.

27:15.226 --> 27:18.594
We're gonna have a mut... let's
get some meat on your bones.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.162
Or we'll put this on your bones.

27:20.164 --> 27:21.964
- We just got a text from Ben.
- Okay.

27:21.966 --> 27:23.665
He said your trip is
playing really well.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.268
- Keep waving the flag.
- Great.

27:25.270 --> 27:28.236
And Jonah's running for
Congress in New Hampshire.

27:28.238 --> 27:29.704
What?

27:29.706 --> 27:32.073
What?

27:32.075 --> 27:33.741
What is that?

27:33.743 --> 27:36.311
- Oh, my God. Ah!
- Oh.

27:39.182 --> 27:42.284
- Here.
- Thank you.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.552
Just... shit.

27:44.554 --> 27:47.021
I bet you there's about 20
pieces of corn in here.

27:47.023 --> 27:49.856
Could be more. Probably fit
a lot of corn in there.

27:50.893 --> 27:52.793
Oh, my God.

27:52.795 --> 27:56.230
What the fuck is going... here.
