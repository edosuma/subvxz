00:38.144 --> 00:39.910
At that school,

00:39.945 --> 00:41.644
You said it was your fault.
What did you mean?

00:41.679 --> 00:43.179
I carried his backpack.

00:43.214 --> 00:44.512
Are you taking me

00:44.548 --> 00:46.380
To hospital?
Not to the hospital

00:46.415 --> 00:49.015
With a bullet wound. The doctors
will tell the police.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.249
They'll say you
aided a terrorist.
I didn't mean to.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.051
I didn't.
Doesn't matter.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.119
They could put you in prison
for the rest of your life.

01:11.063 --> 01:12.629
Come on.

01:20.469 --> 01:22.102
Oui?

01:37.279 --> 01:39.912
(women conversing
in distance)

01:48.519 --> 01:50.485
come on.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.954
It's all right. Sit down.

01:57.591 --> 01:59.324
it's okay.

02:06.396 --> 02:08.996
Here, i want you
to bite on this.

02:09.031 --> 02:11.498
This is gonna hurt.

02:27.775 --> 02:31.676
Ma'am, nina brenner,
u.S. State department.

02:31.712 --> 02:33.077
Have you seen this man?

02:34.646 --> 02:36.012
Yes.

02:36.047 --> 02:37.913
He was here.
When?

02:37.948 --> 02:41.182
I don't know.
Maybe... An hour ago.

02:41.217 --> 02:43.416
Do you know where he went?
My husband

02:43.452 --> 02:45.084
Drove him to the protest.

02:46.354 --> 02:48.653
Ma'am, what protest?

02:48.688 --> 02:51.188
(officer speaking
distantly, distorted)

02:59.461 --> 03:03.495
(distant, distorted voices;
whistle blowing)

03:13.403 --> 03:15.536
(woman crying,
distant and distorted)

03:15.571 --> 03:18.404
So, that's our shooter?

03:18.439 --> 03:21.305
Man 2: Yes, sir.
Iftikar bulfati.

03:21.340 --> 03:24.207
Uk citizen.
Isn't that the kid?

03:24.242 --> 03:26.808
What? What kid?

03:28.679 --> 03:31.244
We pulled him off the train
at st. Pancras.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.180
Two days ago.
Jesus christ.

03:33.215 --> 03:35.114
Border security checked him.
He was clean.
The french say

03:35.149 --> 03:37.515
He had a plastic,
3-d-printed coil gun,

03:37.551 --> 03:40.250
So he wasn't bloody clean,
was he?

03:42.086 --> 03:44.419
Who gave you the tip
to pull him off the train?

03:44.454 --> 03:46.620
I'll have to check that, sir.

03:48.024 --> 03:49.556
We need to get out ahead
of this.

03:49.591 --> 03:52.624
I need details, simon. Now!

04:09.503 --> 04:11.735
Hello?
You know what just happened
in paris?

04:11.771 --> 04:13.436
I'm standing
in the middle of it.

04:13.471 --> 04:15.538
Have you found odum?

04:15.574 --> 04:17.738
I told you i needed 24 hours.

04:17.774 --> 04:21.041
This is blowing up in our faces.
24 hours.

04:27.447 --> 04:30.214
I want to know
what nina brenner is up to.

04:30.249 --> 04:32.315
Put ears on her right away.
We don't have authorization.

04:32.350 --> 04:34.416
Just bloody do it.

04:40.188 --> 04:41.521
U.S. State department.

04:41.555 --> 04:43.487
Can you tell me
what happened here?

04:43.523 --> 04:46.022
He yelled allahu akbar.

04:46.058 --> 04:48.123
Started shooting.

04:48.159 --> 04:51.393
Those poor people.

04:51.428 --> 04:54.795
And you had no idea
what he was planning?

04:56.831 --> 04:59.164
I would have
said something,

04:59.199 --> 05:01.165
Tried to stop him.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.633
He was so sweet.

05:03.668 --> 05:06.068
How could he
do that, just...

05:06.103 --> 05:09.470
Just kill people for no reason?

05:09.505 --> 05:12.638
People aren't always
who you think they are.

05:17.177 --> 05:18.609
We can't let this
get infected.

05:18.644 --> 05:22.577
I need sutures, antibiotics.

05:22.613 --> 05:25.045
You can't just leave me here.
What if someone comes?

05:25.081 --> 05:27.547
The advert said it's been
on the market six months.

05:27.582 --> 05:30.082
Ready for immediate move-in.
There's nobody living here.

05:30.117 --> 05:32.283
But you'll be back soon?

05:32.318 --> 05:33.784
Yeah.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.019
If someone knocks, don't answer.

05:36.054 --> 05:37.353
Don't leave.
Don't contact anyone.

05:37.388 --> 05:38.387
Just stay here.

05:38.422 --> 05:42.256
It's okay. I have a plan.

05:42.291 --> 05:45.391
(woman speaking french
over p.A.)

06:49.498 --> 06:52.464
She says she saw a man with the
girl running in that direction.

06:54.434 --> 06:55.733
Hello?

06:55.769 --> 06:58.168
Tony rice said
i could trust you. Can i?

06:59.203 --> 07:01.436
Where are you?

07:01.471 --> 07:03.271
Midnight. Place de la paix.

07:03.307 --> 07:04.405
Okay, but...

07:04.440 --> 07:05.572
I'll know if you're not alone.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.813
Cctv footage

07:18.848 --> 07:20.648
From st. Pancras station.

07:20.684 --> 07:23.649
That's bulfati
there on the right.

07:23.685 --> 07:26.184
And from
another camera.

07:31.823 --> 07:33.822
Bloody hell.

07:33.857 --> 07:36.123
Show me her face.

07:41.195 --> 07:44.395
Find me that girl.

07:57.138 --> 07:58.570
Open up!

07:58.605 --> 08:01.205
Police!

08:01.240 --> 08:02.673
Liam! Liam!

08:02.709 --> 08:05.307
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

08:05.343 --> 08:06.642
First floor clear!

08:06.677 --> 08:08.109
Ilyana crawford?
Who are you?

08:08.144 --> 08:09.477
What's this about?

08:09.512 --> 08:11.812
Article ten,
anti-terrorism act of 2001.

08:11.847 --> 08:14.480
This house is subject
to full search and seizure.

08:14.515 --> 08:16.881
If you attempt to interfere
with the officers in any way,

08:16.917 --> 08:18.849
You will be detained,
indefinitely.

08:20.919 --> 08:23.418
We need to talk
about your daughter.

08:29.758 --> 08:31.724
Two days ago.

08:31.759 --> 08:34.058
I've been calling,
but she won't answer.

08:34.094 --> 08:36.092
Did she say anything
about going to paris?

08:36.128 --> 08:40.796
Did she ever mention
jihad, or terror groups?

08:40.831 --> 08:43.731
I don't understand.
Are you asking me if kate...
We believe

08:43.765 --> 08:45.599
Kate smuggled the weapon
into paris

08:45.634 --> 08:47.666
That was used
in the attack this morning.

08:47.702 --> 08:49.335
No. She wouldn't. Not kate.

08:50.938 --> 08:52.769
What about this man?

08:52.805 --> 08:54.571
Has he contacted you lately?

08:54.607 --> 08:57.706
He's in france. We think
he's looking for kate.

08:57.741 --> 09:00.140
I believe you know him
as dmitry petrovich.

09:03.612 --> 09:06.011
He came to the house.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.778
I told him

09:07.814 --> 09:09.280
To go away.
Sir,

09:09.315 --> 09:10.614
The girl's computer is up.

09:10.649 --> 09:12.815
We're not done.

09:19.988 --> 09:21.754
How could you not tell me?

09:21.789 --> 09:24.089
I told him to go away.

09:24.124 --> 09:26.090
I thought
that was the end of it.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.357
I never imagined...
What?

09:27.392 --> 09:29.992
That i had a right to know?

09:30.027 --> 09:31.627
That he tried
to talk to kate?

09:31.662 --> 09:33.227
I'm the one that's been here,

09:33.263 --> 09:36.563
For you, for her. Not him.

09:36.598 --> 09:39.797
I'm sorry.

09:42.001 --> 09:44.300
Liam,

09:44.335 --> 09:47.335
What am i going to do?

10:07.916 --> 10:09.715
Let me drive you.

10:09.751 --> 10:13.018
No, thank you. Bus is coming.

10:13.053 --> 10:15.686
What? So you wait in rain?

10:18.956 --> 10:20.922
Get in.

10:20.958 --> 10:23.291
Get in.

10:34.132 --> 10:36.331
Lucky i saw you.

10:36.366 --> 10:38.732
This is the third time
i was lucky to see you.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.000
Strange, yes?

10:47.974 --> 10:49.873
What do you want from me?

10:49.908 --> 10:53.108
And don't lie,
because i will know.

10:53.144 --> 10:55.443
Long way from home.

10:55.478 --> 10:57.377
I need friends.

10:57.413 --> 11:00.812
I think maybe
you need one, too.

11:00.847 --> 11:04.181
I know what a man means
when he says he needs a friend.

11:04.216 --> 11:05.815
No.

11:05.850 --> 11:07.050
That is not true.

11:07.085 --> 11:08.850
This was mistake. Stop the car.

11:08.886 --> 11:10.718
But the rain.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.320
Better to walk in the rain

11:12.355 --> 11:15.121
Than for my husband
to see us together.

11:15.157 --> 11:17.222
Ilyana...

11:17.258 --> 11:19.324
If you ever need anything.

11:19.359 --> 11:20.757
Ever.

11:20.793 --> 11:23.059
Don't be afraid to ask.

11:25.263 --> 11:27.795
Anything.

11:36.002 --> 11:38.735
Dmitry petrovich
is a cold-blooded killer.

11:38.770 --> 11:41.837
And we have a witness who says
he saw him shoot this man dead.

11:41.872 --> 11:43.905
Ivan kost, czech pimp,

11:43.940 --> 11:45.706
Member of the nemcek crew.

11:45.741 --> 11:48.341
Maybe they're going to war
against the russians.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.876
You have a body?
No,

11:51.912 --> 11:55.111
But the victim's
been missing for weeks.

11:55.146 --> 11:57.213
Who's your witness?

11:57.248 --> 11:58.814
Tamir zakayev.

11:58.849 --> 12:01.215
This guy.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.450
He's a junkie.
You will have to do

12:03.485 --> 12:05.751
Better than that.

12:05.786 --> 12:08.386
Well, then give us a warrant
so we can search dmitry's club,

12:08.421 --> 12:10.487
We'll find evidence,
use it as leverage

12:10.522 --> 12:12.189
To pressure him
to turn on his bosses.

12:12.223 --> 12:14.457
How do you americans say it?

12:14.492 --> 12:17.291
You want to go fishing?

12:17.326 --> 12:19.293
Well, i'm sorry.

12:19.328 --> 12:21.327
No.

12:24.964 --> 12:27.430
What if we put
a wire on tamir?

12:27.466 --> 12:30.466
Maybe we can get petrovich
to implicate himself.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.266
Come on, blazek.

12:32.302 --> 12:34.235
Don't you want to be known
as the prosecutor

12:34.270 --> 12:35.836
Who helped
bring down the russians?

12:38.139 --> 12:40.305
Prosecutor doesn't
believe you, tamir.

12:40.340 --> 12:42.106
Thinks you're lying
about seeing the shooting.

12:42.141 --> 12:44.007
Not my problem.

12:44.043 --> 12:46.309
It'll be your problem if we
arrest you on drug charges.

12:46.344 --> 12:49.010
Look, tamir, we want
to put dmitry away, not you.

12:49.046 --> 12:51.212
But we have no body,
no murder weapon.

12:51.247 --> 12:54.279
So you are gonna
get us a confession on tape.
No.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.814
Dmitry finds out, he kills me.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.515
He won't find out.
No!

12:57.550 --> 12:59.516
Absolutely no.
Well, how about i send

12:59.551 --> 13:02.017
Pictures of you talking to us
to your brother?

13:06.022 --> 13:07.554
What do you think doku would do?

13:23.466 --> 13:26.099
Doku, what are you doing?

13:26.135 --> 13:28.867
I told you, no more school.

13:28.902 --> 13:31.169
You have no right!

13:31.204 --> 13:32.770
You hid these from me, huh?

13:32.805 --> 13:34.036
They are mine.

13:38.475 --> 13:40.307
You don't need them anymore.

13:45.546 --> 13:49.045
Where we are going, wives do
not need accounting degrees.

14:18.099 --> 14:19.531
I must speak to you.

14:26.236 --> 14:28.202
Please, sit.

14:28.237 --> 14:29.970
No, thank you.

14:30.006 --> 14:32.338
You said if i ever
needed anything--

14:32.374 --> 14:34.139
Anything--
i should come to you.

14:34.176 --> 14:36.140
How can i help?

14:36.176 --> 14:38.341
My husband wants to take
me and my daughter

14:38.377 --> 14:40.476
To chechnya to live.

14:40.511 --> 14:43.278
He wants me to be a good
muslim wife.

14:43.313 --> 14:45.779
But i will never
go back to that country.

14:45.815 --> 14:49.015
You need money for divorce?

14:49.050 --> 14:50.415
He said if i refuse

14:50.451 --> 14:52.983
To go, he will kill me.

14:53.019 --> 14:55.185
And take katya.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.154
There is only
one solution.

15:00.356 --> 15:02.390
You must kill my husband.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.548
If i don't kill doku,

15:16.584 --> 15:18.349
Ilyana won't trust me.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.584
I'm supposed to be
a ruthless bastard.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.585
Supposed to be is
quite a bit different

15:22.620 --> 15:24.153
From actually being one.

15:24.188 --> 15:25.520
He's a wife-beater.

15:25.555 --> 15:26.921
And a murderer.

15:26.957 --> 15:28.555
Maybe i should kill him.

15:28.591 --> 15:30.056
We need doku alive.

15:30.091 --> 15:31.858
He's our path
to the general.

15:31.893 --> 15:34.292
So? What's your
brilliant solution?

15:34.328 --> 15:38.261
We offer her
an alternative.

15:38.296 --> 15:40.262
My bosses in moscow,

15:40.297 --> 15:42.196
They do much business
with your husband.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.565
They will not permit me
to kill him.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.034
I was wrong
to come to you.

15:47.068 --> 15:48.601
I have better offer--

15:48.636 --> 15:51.102
I can get you out of
country-- you and katya.

15:51.138 --> 15:53.904
Give you new life.

15:55.273 --> 15:56.972
How?

15:57.007 --> 15:59.473
New home.
New papers.

15:59.509 --> 16:01.308
New identity.

16:01.344 --> 16:04.010
Where would we go?

16:04.046 --> 16:06.911
You have been
to london?

16:08.481 --> 16:10.147
But...

16:10.182 --> 16:12.248
There is price.

16:12.283 --> 16:14.050
You know of man

16:14.085 --> 16:16.484
Called general arsanov?

16:16.520 --> 16:20.019
He was my husband's
commander.

16:20.055 --> 16:22.387
He helped us
to escape chechnya.

16:22.423 --> 16:25.056
He owes my bosses millions.

16:25.091 --> 16:28.058
In return for new life
in london,

16:28.093 --> 16:31.326
You find out from doku
where the general is.

16:32.529 --> 16:35.228
Spy on my husband?

16:35.264 --> 16:37.897
Do you know
how dangerous this will be?

16:37.932 --> 16:39.531
more dangerous

16:39.566 --> 16:41.032
Than asking me
to kill him?

16:41.068 --> 16:43.600
You are criminal.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.069
Your bosses are criminals.

16:46.104 --> 16:48.236
How do i know
you keep your promise?

16:48.272 --> 16:50.404
You can trust me.
No.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.672
No trust.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.074
Proof.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.116
Maybe you should look away.

17:11.151 --> 17:12.751
I'm not afraid.

17:17.321 --> 17:19.054
Where'd you learn to do that?

17:19.089 --> 17:20.455
You're not
a doctor, yeah?

17:20.491 --> 17:22.223
No, i'm not a doctor.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.659
I might want to be one.

17:25.694 --> 17:27.425
I'm pretty good at science.

17:29.129 --> 17:31.895
My mum told me things about you.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.563
Did she?

17:33.598 --> 17:35.997
Said you were
in the russian mafia.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.232
That true?

17:37.267 --> 17:38.899
I don't remember.

17:38.935 --> 17:41.601
Doubt i was
ever in the mafia.

17:41.636 --> 17:43.235
So what did you do?

17:49.074 --> 17:50.340
You,

17:50.375 --> 17:52.241
Mum,

17:52.276 --> 17:54.409
Ifti.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.577
Everyone's always
keeping secrets from me.

18:00.215 --> 18:01.746
Can you keep a secret?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.649
Sure i can.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.385
I'm an intelligence officer.

18:11.421 --> 18:13.553
At least, i was.

18:13.589 --> 18:15.754
I worked for the british,
and then the americans.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.490
No way.

18:17.525 --> 18:19.090
Like james bond?

18:19.126 --> 18:21.458
not exactly.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.095
If you're a spy, aren't there
people who can help us?

18:27.131 --> 18:28.929
Someone at an agency
or something?

18:28.965 --> 18:31.164
Maybe.

18:31.199 --> 18:33.198
But you can't always trust them.

18:33.234 --> 18:35.633
You think maybe being a spy

18:35.668 --> 18:37.567
Is the reason
you left mum and me?

18:43.573 --> 18:47.406
Look, no matter
why i left or what i did,

18:47.442 --> 18:49.175
It won't happen again.

18:51.145 --> 18:53.744
I'm gonna see you
through this, kate.

18:53.779 --> 18:56.646
Thanks, papa.

19:01.317 --> 19:03.383
So what are we gonna do?

19:03.418 --> 19:07.019
You're gonna rest.

19:07.054 --> 19:09.420
And i'm gonna go and try
and make a deal

19:09.456 --> 19:11.155
To keep you out of prison.

19:11.190 --> 19:13.523
Really? How?

19:13.558 --> 19:16.224
By giving my old bosses

19:16.260 --> 19:19.360
Something they seem
to want very badly.

19:23.831 --> 19:26.464
Kate crawford's computer
contained numerous messages

19:26.499 --> 19:29.565
Between herself and her
traveling companions to paris.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.367
But they never
mentioned anything

19:31.402 --> 19:33.201
Of jihad or terror groups.

19:33.236 --> 19:34.468
So she's a dead end?

19:34.503 --> 19:36.136
Not necessarily.

19:36.172 --> 19:37.737
There are a thread of e-mails
between kate

19:37.772 --> 19:40.338
And a young woman
by the name of khava bazaeva.

19:40.375 --> 19:43.307
And she is?
Intelligence says
she's a recruiter, sir.

19:43.342 --> 19:45.208
For chechen
terror cells.

19:45.243 --> 19:47.342
The crawford girl
was being groomed?

19:47.378 --> 19:49.110
Turns out she has
relatives in prague.

19:49.145 --> 19:51.212
An uncle.
Tamir zakayev.

19:51.247 --> 19:52.979
The groomer was trying
to put them together.

19:53.015 --> 19:55.114
He's on the watch list.
Apparently he funnels money

19:55.149 --> 19:57.015
Into eastern europe
for terror attacks.

19:57.050 --> 20:00.017
There's chatter
he's cooking something up

20:00.052 --> 20:02.385
For the russian-nato
summit in prague.

20:02.420 --> 20:04.653
Could we...

20:04.688 --> 20:06.353
Use the crawford girl?

20:06.389 --> 20:09.289
Put her on the inside
with her uncle?

20:09.324 --> 20:12.324
Excellent idea, sir.

20:12.359 --> 20:14.792
But we'd need to find her first.

20:14.827 --> 20:16.459
Any ideas to that end?

20:18.330 --> 20:20.329
Mrs. Crawford,
there's a manhunt underway

20:20.364 --> 20:22.330
In paris
for your daughter.

20:22.366 --> 20:24.665
If the french police find her,
they'll almost certainly

20:24.700 --> 20:27.433
Prosecute her to the fullest
extent of the law.

20:27.468 --> 20:30.068
Now, if my lot
could find her first,

20:30.103 --> 20:32.203
We might be able
to help her avoid arrest.

20:32.239 --> 20:33.536
In fact,
we might be able

20:33.572 --> 20:38.573
To keep her out of jail
altogether.

20:38.608 --> 20:40.741
Ho

20:40.777 --> 20:44.410
No matter what you did...

20:44.445 --> 20:46.411
We love you.

20:46.446 --> 20:50.614
All we want for you
is to be safe.

20:50.649 --> 20:54.516
Wherever you are...

20:54.551 --> 20:58.451
If you can get to a phone...

20:58.486 --> 21:01.220
Call us.

21:01.255 --> 21:04.121
I love you, darling.
Please.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.524
Call us.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.725
Please come home.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.594
We miss you, okay?

21:13.629 --> 21:16.295
Please come home.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.385
Curtis.

21:55.420 --> 21:56.786
I brought back the files.

21:56.822 --> 21:58.320
Thanks for those.

21:58.356 --> 21:59.622
Did you see who was
just on the news?

21:59.657 --> 22:01.489
No, i was in a briefing.

22:01.524 --> 22:03.190
Ilyana zakayev.

22:03.225 --> 22:04.691
Doku's wife?
Yeah.

22:04.727 --> 22:06.292
Only her name is crawford now.

22:06.327 --> 22:07.692
She lives in london.

22:07.728 --> 22:09.794
She was pleading for the
return of her daughter.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.762
That's the girl
who transported the weapon.

22:11.797 --> 22:13.329
How is that possible?

22:13.365 --> 22:14.863
It can't be a coincidence,
right?

22:14.898 --> 22:17.632
Dmitry petrovich has got
to be tied into that somehow.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.500
I'm on my way to london
to talk to ilyana.

22:19.535 --> 22:20.901
My flight leaves in an hour.

22:20.936 --> 22:23.602
Be careful, curtis.

22:23.638 --> 22:25.503
She won't be happy to see you,

22:25.538 --> 22:26.704
And you're still
off the books.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.572
You have no police cover.

22:30.742 --> 22:32.307
Gabi...

22:35.344 --> 22:37.810
I don't know when i'm going
to see you again,

22:37.846 --> 22:40.178
So i just want to say...

22:45.784 --> 22:47.516
Thank you.

22:47.551 --> 22:49.450
For everything.

23:24.774 --> 23:26.372
You'll be okay.

23:26.408 --> 23:28.608
No one will come tonight.

23:28.643 --> 23:30.542
You get some sleep.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.243
I'll be back
before you wake up.

23:45.753 --> 23:48.585
I won't be long.

23:57.935 --> 24:00.134
And wendy's new
bacon fondue fries.

24:00.169 --> 24:01.935
(indistinct police radio
communication)

24:01.970 --> 24:03.769
Special agent
curtis ballard, fbi.

24:03.804 --> 24:05.738
I'd like to speak
with mrs. Crawford.

24:20.148 --> 24:22.047
Ilyana zakayev?

24:24.884 --> 24:26.917
You remember me?

24:26.952 --> 24:28.250
How did you...?

24:28.286 --> 24:30.985
I'm looking
for dmitry petrovich.

24:32.889 --> 24:35.222
I already told everything
to the british police.

24:35.257 --> 24:37.323
Well, i need you to tell me.
Where is he?

24:41.294 --> 24:44.027
It's a nice house you have here.

24:44.062 --> 24:46.962
Does your new family know
about your days in prague?

24:50.899 --> 24:53.265
He was here.

24:53.301 --> 24:54.667
He spoke to my daughter.

24:54.702 --> 24:55.900
They say he went to paris

24:55.936 --> 24:57.768
To find her.
Now please, leave.

24:57.803 --> 24:58.835
Paris? You sure?

24:58.871 --> 24:59.903
Excuse me.

24:59.939 --> 25:01.704
Who the devil are you?

25:01.739 --> 25:04.139
Special agent ballard, fbi.

25:04.174 --> 25:06.006
No, no.

25:06.042 --> 25:08.808
How many times do i have
to tell your lot,

25:08.843 --> 25:10.175
Odum is our business,

25:10.210 --> 25:12.743
Not yours.
He's wanted in the u.S.

25:12.779 --> 25:15.412
And if we find him,
i'll be sure to let you know.

25:18.349 --> 25:22.116
Please escort special agent
ballard off the premises.

25:24.453 --> 25:26.585
Thank you, ilyana.

25:26.621 --> 25:28.253
You've been very helpful.

25:33.058 --> 25:36.358
Ilyana wants proof
that i can get her to london.

25:36.393 --> 25:40.293
I need passports,
visas, right away.

25:40.329 --> 25:42.661
Home office would
have to approve,

25:42.697 --> 25:45.129
And even if they did,
it might take some weeks.

25:45.165 --> 25:46.898
Weeks?!

25:46.933 --> 25:48.765
Christ, terrence.

25:48.801 --> 25:50.299
For all we know
the whole lot of them

25:50.335 --> 25:51.834
Could be off
to chechnya tomorrow.

25:51.869 --> 25:53.301
What good is six
if they can't get us

25:53.337 --> 25:54.969
A couple of bloody passports?

25:55.004 --> 25:57.003
Well, they pay our
salaries, don't they?

26:00.107 --> 26:02.773
What about
our other friends?

26:02.809 --> 26:04.241
Maybe they could get it done.

26:04.277 --> 26:05.842
I don't want to involve them

26:05.877 --> 26:07.810
Unless it's absolutely
necessary.

26:07.845 --> 26:09.144
Do you know what i read
in the paper yesterday?

26:09.180 --> 26:10.411
There are 10,000

26:10.447 --> 26:12.779
British tourists in prague.

26:12.815 --> 26:14.114
Imagine that.

26:14.149 --> 26:15.881
They must all have
valid passports.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.050
Be a shame if a couple
of them were to go missing.

26:29.358 --> 26:32.257
(cameras clicking,
crowd exclaims and applauds)

26:32.293 --> 26:35.760
(woman speaks foreign language,
bell clanging)

26:38.030 --> 26:39.095
Watch the clock tower.

26:39.130 --> 26:40.396
I see that.

26:41.798 --> 26:44.264
Look at that!

26:44.300 --> 26:45.866
Isn't that neat!

26:45.901 --> 26:47.300
Oh, would you look at that.

27:24.257 --> 27:26.690
All right,
just be calm, natural.

27:26.725 --> 27:28.191
Try to put him at ease.

27:28.227 --> 27:30.259
Guide the conversation to
the night of the murder.

27:30.294 --> 27:32.794
Natural. Okay.

27:32.829 --> 27:34.661
Guide the conversation.

27:34.697 --> 27:36.429
Don't worry.

27:36.464 --> 27:37.964
Russians love to talk about

27:37.999 --> 27:39.931
The big, bad things
they've done.

27:43.769 --> 27:45.502
Go get us a confession.

27:48.772 --> 27:50.771
Good morning, my friend.

27:50.806 --> 27:52.039
Good morning.

27:52.074 --> 27:53.272
We have business?

27:53.307 --> 27:54.940
You are early at work, huh?

27:54.976 --> 27:56.908
Early to bed, early to rise.

27:56.943 --> 27:57.909
Yes?

27:57.944 --> 27:59.777
What do you want, tamir?

28:00.979 --> 28:03.011
I want to thank you

28:03.047 --> 28:04.946
Again.
For what?

28:06.149 --> 28:09.149
For what you did f-for me.

28:09.184 --> 28:11.116
That night.

28:12.319 --> 28:13.985
What night
are you talking about?

28:15.788 --> 28:17.787
I mean...

28:22.292 --> 28:23.524
Nothing.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.293
We see each other later, yes?

28:29.797 --> 28:30.961
He blew it.

28:30.997 --> 28:32.762
Tamir! Tamir!

28:32.798 --> 28:34.097
He knew!

28:34.132 --> 28:35.297
He was going to shoot me.

28:35.332 --> 28:36.698
You're being paranoid.

28:36.734 --> 28:37.899
I know that man.

28:37.934 --> 28:40.000
He is very smart.

28:44.772 --> 28:45.837
You have no choice, tamir.

28:45.872 --> 28:48.338
You have to try again.

28:50.041 --> 28:52.374
I can't.

28:54.344 --> 28:56.043
How about i do something
else for you?

28:56.079 --> 28:59.745
You say you need a murder
weapon to arrest dmitry.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.047
What if i get this for you?

29:02.083 --> 29:03.981
That way i don't
have to wear wire.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.033
I have kate crawford.

29:35.068 --> 29:37.301
Jesus, martin.

29:37.336 --> 29:39.103
Now you're harboring
a terror suspect?

29:39.138 --> 29:40.970
She's innocent.
She didn't do anything.

29:41.005 --> 29:42.237
We both know
that doesn't matter.

29:43.807 --> 29:45.873
I need a guarantee
she won't be prosecuted.

29:45.908 --> 29:47.340
Look, you're in no position
to make demands.

29:47.375 --> 29:48.441
I'll turn myself in.

29:48.477 --> 29:50.109
You, six,

29:50.144 --> 29:51.876
The fbi, can do what the
hell you want with me.

29:51.911 --> 29:54.045
But kate, she stays out of jail.

29:54.079 --> 29:56.413
I'd have to go
way up the food chain

29:56.448 --> 29:58.848
To get a guarantee like that.

29:58.883 --> 30:00.515
Well, you better hurry up,

30:00.550 --> 30:02.382
'cause i can't
hide her forever.

30:12.057 --> 30:13.956
What are you doing?

30:13.991 --> 30:15.390
What the hell are you doing?!
Back off.

30:15.426 --> 30:17.024
He's not your concern.

30:18.128 --> 30:19.993
You set me up.

30:27.233 --> 30:29.565
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

30:33.903 --> 30:36.302
You bastard!
You bugged my phone?

30:36.338 --> 30:37.837
What the hell, simon?

30:37.873 --> 30:39.004
If you'd have kept in touch,

30:39.039 --> 30:40.172
That wouldn't have
been necessary.

30:40.207 --> 30:41.405
He has the girl.

30:41.441 --> 30:43.207
Kate crawford?

30:43.243 --> 30:44.508
He was going to tell me
where she is

30:44.543 --> 30:46.108
And you blew that
by grabbing him.

30:46.144 --> 30:47.343
My lucky day.

30:47.378 --> 30:49.010
We're after her as well, so,

30:49.045 --> 30:50.445
Thanks for that.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.246
You think odum is going
to tell you where she is?

30:52.281 --> 30:53.913
If he trusted you,

30:53.948 --> 30:55.448
He would've walked into
your office two months ago.

30:55.483 --> 30:57.115
He came to me, not you.

30:57.151 --> 30:58.449
I'll take my chances.

30:58.484 --> 30:59.850
Good-bye nina.

30:59.886 --> 31:01.284
You cut me out,
and i'll tell your chief

31:01.319 --> 31:03.418
You passed me
classified documents.

31:04.655 --> 31:06.954
You'll go down with me.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.055
Try me.

31:11.592 --> 31:13.324
What do you want?

31:13.360 --> 31:14.926
I want in.

31:14.961 --> 31:17.628
Wherever you took odum,
i want to be there.

31:17.663 --> 31:20.562
This is my operation
as much as yours.

31:20.597 --> 31:23.931
I'll be in paris in two hours
to talk to odum.

31:23.966 --> 31:26.299
I'll send an officer
to pick you up.

31:35.664 --> 31:37.130
New identity,

31:37.165 --> 31:38.764
New home.

31:38.799 --> 31:42.367
First you help us
find general arsanov.

31:42.402 --> 31:44.234
How will i do this?

31:44.270 --> 31:45.635
Doku and i barely speak.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.336
Tell him, no more fights.

31:48.372 --> 31:51.171
Prove you can be obedient wife.

31:53.441 --> 31:57.209
I will help you through this.

32:26.295 --> 32:29.094
What are you doing?

32:29.130 --> 32:33.196
I left my phone here yesterday.

32:48.608 --> 32:51.874
(male vocalist speaking
in rhythm to the beat)

32:54.312 --> 32:57.277
Dmitry is here?
No.

33:38.671 --> 33:41.770
You know the game.

33:41.806 --> 33:44.205
You've been renditioned.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.107
As of this moment,
you are a man

33:46.142 --> 33:49.542
Without a country
and without rights.

33:57.182 --> 34:00.282
We could send you back
to america to face charges--

34:00.317 --> 34:05.318
Killing the director
of the fbi, i believe.

34:05.354 --> 34:09.554
Or you could tell us
where kate crawford is.

34:11.824 --> 34:14.290
The only reason
six would want kate

34:14.324 --> 34:16.658
Is to use her for something.

34:18.828 --> 34:20.360
What?

34:20.396 --> 34:22.462
I understand

34:22.496 --> 34:25.197
You've been looking for clues
as to your past life.

34:25.232 --> 34:28.431
I could get you answers

34:28.467 --> 34:31.632
If you tell me
where the girl is.

34:31.668 --> 34:34.135
I gave nina brenner my price.

34:34.170 --> 34:37.304
You agree not to prosecute kate,
i'll tell you where she is.

34:37.339 --> 34:39.472
Done.

34:39.507 --> 34:41.672
You don't have the power.

34:43.641 --> 34:46.476
Bring me someone who does.

35:29.704 --> 35:31.870
Oui?
Excusez-moi?

35:33.539 --> 35:35.638
...Use your phone?

35:35.673 --> 35:38.807
Oui. Entrez.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.180
It's from paris!

35:55.385 --> 35:56.484
Kate?

35:56.520 --> 35:58.652
Mum. I want to come home.

35:58.687 --> 36:00.353
Are you hurt?

36:00.388 --> 36:03.288
I'm okay.
Papa's been taking care of me.

36:03.323 --> 36:04.722
But he's gone now.

36:04.757 --> 36:07.223
I think maybe
something happened to him.

36:07.259 --> 36:08.925
Can you come get me?

36:08.960 --> 36:10.627
Where are you?

36:10.661 --> 36:13.394
In paris. I don't know
the address, but i can ask.

36:13.430 --> 36:16.363
Got it. Send the agents.

36:16.398 --> 36:18.631
No, sweetie. It's okay.

36:18.666 --> 36:20.331
Some people are coming
to get you.

36:20.367 --> 36:21.865
They'll be there
in a few minutes.

36:21.901 --> 36:23.300
What people?

36:23.335 --> 36:25.234
Who's coming to get me?

36:25.270 --> 36:27.903
Mum, the police will arrest me.

36:27.938 --> 36:29.537
These aren't the police.

36:29.572 --> 36:30.905
They think i had something
to do with the shooting,

36:30.940 --> 36:32.439
But i didn't.

36:32.474 --> 36:33.640
I didn't do anything wrong!

36:33.675 --> 36:35.341
They just want to talk to you.

36:35.376 --> 36:37.842
You'll be safe with them.

36:37.877 --> 36:39.776
Are they there now?

36:39.812 --> 36:42.545
Are they listening to this call?

36:42.580 --> 36:45.647
Mum, how could you let them?

36:45.682 --> 36:48.449
They came to our house.
They're worried about you.

36:48.484 --> 36:49.782
They are not

36:49.818 --> 36:51.483
Worried about me.

36:51.518 --> 36:53.652
They want to put me in jail!
You lied to me again!

36:53.687 --> 36:54.952
No, kate,

36:54.987 --> 36:56.586
I didn't.

36:56.621 --> 36:58.788
Oh, god.

37:01.758 --> 37:04.959
Merci beaucoup.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.959
Aking french)

37:37.963 --> 37:40.163
Oh, god.

37:40.198 --> 37:42.297
How long have i been....?

38:06.280 --> 38:07.779
Search this woman's apartment.

38:07.815 --> 38:10.247
We'll take the second floor.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.587
Where the hell did she get to?

38:55.342 --> 38:57.808
I know we had
troubles lately, doku,

38:57.844 --> 39:00.377
But i have
been thinking.

39:00.412 --> 39:04.012
I don't want to go to chechnya.
You know this.

39:04.048 --> 39:06.514
But i don't want to lose
my daughter, either,

39:06.549 --> 39:08.648
So i decided,
no more fighting

39:08.684 --> 39:11.751
If you promise you will not
take katya away from me.

39:15.588 --> 39:19.055
I will try to be wife you want.

39:27.895 --> 39:31.295
I hope so.

39:43.271 --> 39:44.903
The gun

39:44.938 --> 39:47.304
That dmitry used
to kill jaroscz--

39:47.340 --> 39:49.806
I can tell you where it is.

39:51.276 --> 39:52.841
You told us dmitry
didn't kill jaroscz.

39:52.878 --> 39:54.342
You said he killed
someone else.

39:54.377 --> 39:56.377
What the hell are
you up to, tamir?

39:56.413 --> 39:58.678
You want to catch petrovich,
yes or no?

39:58.714 --> 40:01.313
Promise me i do not
have to wear wire

40:01.349 --> 40:05.582
Or testify, and i will tell you
where to find the gun.

40:17.057 --> 40:19.690
Uh, it's pretty
convenient

40:19.726 --> 40:21.758
He suddenly knows
where a murder weapon is.

40:21.794 --> 40:23.293
We don't need to convict him.

40:23.328 --> 40:25.027
We just need evidence
to squeeze him.

40:25.062 --> 40:27.295
Even if that evidence is false?

40:27.330 --> 40:30.464
If it gets us dmitry,
does it really matter?

40:42.573 --> 40:44.906
Where's the gun?

41:04.453 --> 41:08.686
For whatever it's worth,
i didn't set you up.

41:11.523 --> 41:13.823
Did you get the assurances
i asked for?

41:13.858 --> 41:16.391
No.

41:16.426 --> 41:19.426
But kate is safe.

41:19.462 --> 41:22.094
But the only way
you could know that is if...

41:22.130 --> 41:24.496
She's here.

41:24.531 --> 41:26.831
Kate's here.

41:29.468 --> 41:32.367
Kate, you're in a quite a spot.

41:32.403 --> 41:34.068
The french would love to put you

41:34.103 --> 41:36.636
In prison... For years.

41:36.672 --> 41:38.838
Maybe decades.

41:42.908 --> 41:45.441
I might be able
to help you with that.

41:47.579 --> 41:51.378
But i'll need you
to help me in return.
