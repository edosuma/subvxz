Subrip by DanDee

00:34.335 --> 00:36.935
Come catch me!

00:56.723 --> 00:59.124
Mr. Roland,
there's a buzzing sound.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.761
Okay.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.263
Quiet, please!

01:04.265 --> 01:05.697
All right, quiet
down, everybody.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.801
Oh, it makes sense.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.334
Shh.

01:09.335 --> 01:11.104
All right, everyone, quiet down.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.506
Shh.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.140
Quiet.

01:15.141 --> 01:15.975
All right.

01:16.944 --> 01:17.978
I don't care if anyone has to go

01:17.979 --> 01:20.012
to the bathroom, all right?

01:20.013 --> 01:22.348
We're just trying to
wrap things up here.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.349
Um, wait, we need a
little bit more light.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.086
Can you open those
up a little bit?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.488
Yeah, that's perfect.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.323
You ready?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.358
Okay.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.227
And.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.931
Hey, my name is Matt Ortaga.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.800
I go to Cliff Ridge High
School here in Colorado,

01:40.801 --> 01:43.503
and this is my senior project.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.473
Shh.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.708
Good, good, camera good?

01:49.709 --> 01:50.643
Sound good?

01:52.078 --> 01:55.414
All right, this is what we call
IDing your film, all right?

01:55.415 --> 01:56.949
It's expected of everybody

01:56.950 --> 01:58.318
at the beginning
of their project.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.954
You can read more about
it in the handout.

01:59.955 --> 02:04.289
I expect it from every
video, no exceptions.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.359
And remember, be genuine.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.864
Be truthful.

02:10.931 --> 02:11.765
Okay?

02:27.247 --> 02:28.847
What are you doin'?

02:28.848 --> 02:30.316
You look
pretty wicked right now.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.751
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.186
Show me a couple poses.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.461
Oops.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.465
This film is
about Jessie Martell,

02:45.466 --> 02:47.902
who used to be my girlfriend.

02:49.703 --> 02:53.873
It's also about how darkness
can take over your life,

02:55.709 --> 02:59.513
even when you think you
have it under control.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.060
It didn't start this way.

03:14.929 --> 03:18.464
It was gonna be just
about me and Jessie

03:18.465 --> 03:19.799
and our trip to LA.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.341
Cool.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.952
Well, Jessie.
- What about that?

03:38.953 --> 03:40.621
Oh, it's a.

03:44.457 --> 03:45.291
Look up.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.598
That was a great movie.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.599
That was good.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.154
As much as I'd like to say

04:17.156 --> 04:19.392
it's a happy-go-lucky film,

04:22.629 --> 04:23.463
it's not.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.504
About two days ago,

04:32.505 --> 04:34.440
I received this packet.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.279
Inside, there was a
DV tape and a note.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.483
It said, "Leonerd Sawyar".

04:45.319 --> 04:49.156
Underneath that, the
freaky drawing of an eye,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.758
and the words "the end".

05:15.081 --> 05:17.349
This is the DV tape.

05:54.288 --> 05:58.624
This tape shows most of
what happened to Jessie.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.825
If I were to run
it all right now,

05:59.826 --> 06:02.361
she'd be another
face, another name.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.595
She'd just be like
any other story

06:03.596 --> 06:04.897
you might have heard.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.501
But you wouldn't know the girl.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.237
So I wanna start
at the beginning.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.308
It seemed that before
her folks split up,

06:15.309 --> 06:16.477
she was happy.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.912
That's when they
lived in Empire.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.515
She's always smiling,
goofing around.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.551
Then her dad left,

06:25.552 --> 06:27.753
and everything got screwed up.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.156
Not just Jessie, but her mom.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.159
She's always drinking.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.995
Their place is a mess.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.598
I didn't like to go there much.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.234
Even when her mom
tried to do something

06:41.235 --> 06:43.001
nice for her birthday,

06:43.002 --> 06:45.270
it was a complete disaster.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.774
This is for you, and for me.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.646
Cake in my.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.417
Blow it out.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.484
I already did,
like three times.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.286
Shit!

07:03.490 --> 07:05.324
Happy birthday to you.

07:15.468 --> 07:16.936
When I first
got to know Jessie,

07:16.937 --> 07:18.871
things were simpler.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.039
It was just the
two of us playing

07:20.040 --> 07:22.008
stupid, creepy hide-and-seek.

07:22.009 --> 07:22.843
Well?

07:24.278 --> 07:27.381
Are you coming or are you
just gonna stand there?

07:32.685 --> 07:34.921
This is our shortcut
from school.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.289
They tell you never
to take the shortcut

07:36.290 --> 07:38.192
because it's dangerous.

07:41.528 --> 07:44.465
I don't believe in
that kinda shit.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.068
We're just a bunch of
irresponsible thrill-seekers.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.037
Yep.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.270
We're playing with fire,

07:52.271 --> 07:54.539
just waiting to get in trouble.

07:54.540 --> 07:55.375
That's us.

07:57.043 --> 08:00.479
My mom says we're
just asking for it.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.647
Asking for it.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.251
I don't believe in
that kinda shit either.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.086
Woo hoo!

08:08.387 --> 08:10.890
Come on, you stupid psychopaths!

08:10.891 --> 08:13.626
Crazy serial killer
freak motherfuckers!

08:13.627 --> 08:15.561
What are you waiting for?

08:29.408 --> 08:31.510
Oh shit.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.945
No fucking way.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.119
There's probably some

08:40.120 --> 08:42.522
old dude sitting in
his car right now

08:42.523 --> 08:45.292
thinking, "Should
I chop them up?

08:47.727 --> 08:49.896
"Should I kidnap 'em first

08:52.131 --> 08:53.633
"and lock 'em up?"

08:55.335 --> 08:57.738
Do you see that in your mind?

08:58.639 --> 08:59.438
Oh yeah.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.508
He'd probably kill me first.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.678
I'd be stabbed everywhere,

09:07.980 --> 09:09.216
blood all over.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.788
And then he'd come after you.

09:15.655 --> 09:16.589
And then?

09:17.823 --> 09:21.426
And then we'd
both be dismembered.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.261
Heads,

09:23.496 --> 09:24.330
feet,

09:26.066 --> 09:26.899
hands.

09:29.035 --> 09:32.204
We'd be chopped up
into little pieces.

09:34.041 --> 09:37.210
But, in a weird way,
we'd be together.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.345
Really?

09:44.884 --> 09:45.718
Cool.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.156
That's January 2nd.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.892
On May 16th, last year,

09:52.893 --> 09:55.062
I drove with Jessie to LA.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.899
Three months later,
she was dead.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.500
When I went to the funeral,

10:02.501 --> 10:05.338
Becky and Mikey from
school were there.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.374
Plus, of course, Wren
Myer and Liz Gaint.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.946
These are the girls that
she used to smoke with.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.617
That was their kinship,
or something like that.

10:17.618 --> 10:21.220
I know deep down they
looked up to her.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.089
Jessie loved you very much.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.523
You know that, right?

10:24.524 --> 10:25.859
- I know.
- Yeah?

10:30.964 --> 10:34.133
I can't say
why people didn't come.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.801
I think they got the
wrong idea about Jessie

10:35.802 --> 10:37.204
and what she'd been up to.

10:37.205 --> 10:38.838
Oh my God.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.208
Maybe they felt
ashamed, I don't know.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.244
But I wasn't.

10:45.578 --> 10:49.148
I just thought of
her like always.

10:50.683 --> 10:51.517
Yeah.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.620
Hey, handsome.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.989
You comin' over to say hi to me?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.992
Here, let me
give this to someone else.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.675
Those were the good times.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.811
Just crazy and fun,
for the most part.

11:24.216 --> 11:28.086
Except for when Wren, who
had a crush on Jessie,

11:28.087 --> 11:29.255
got all heavy.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.590
The day she found out
that Jess was leaving,

11:32.591 --> 11:34.694
well, everything blew up.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.297
I don't know what to say.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.998
What do you want me to say?

11:41.999 --> 11:43.168
Come on, you can
do better than that.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.335
If you love that guy so much,

11:44.336 --> 11:45.870
why are you leaving your man?

11:45.871 --> 11:50.676
Bullshit, Wren, she
doesn't have to answer that.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.611
- Hey.
- No, it's okay.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.918
I think I'm going because

11:59.052 --> 12:01.821
it's what I've
always wanted to do.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.157
You know, just check it out.

12:05.357 --> 12:08.294
Hey, it's LA, isn't
that reason enough?

12:10.197 --> 12:13.133
But I guess the
real reason is that

12:17.370 --> 12:20.706
it's easier to leave
the people you love

12:23.342 --> 12:25.177
before they leave you.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.480
And those words said it all.

12:28.481 --> 12:32.052
It wasn't about me,
Mikey, or Wren and Liz.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.888
Jess was dealing with
something deeper.

12:35.889 --> 12:40.191
It was pushing her
away, some place darker.

12:40.192 --> 12:44.364
And, in a way, you could
see she was feeding into it.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.834
When news came out about
what happened to Jessie,

12:47.835 --> 12:49.769
the police did nothing.

12:51.138 --> 12:55.541
Four months passed, and
there's nothing to show for it.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.710
Not one thing.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.152
When the case went cold,
I started the blog.

13:06.886 --> 13:10.122
At the time, I didn't
know what else to do.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.791
I had to do something.

13:22.501 --> 13:23.735
In the beginning, the newspapers

13:23.736 --> 13:27.306
were writing all kinds
of stuff about the case.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.340
But then, after a while,
you didn't hear anything,

13:29.341 --> 13:31.244
like it never happened.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.715
For Jessie's mom, I think
that the blog helped

13:36.716 --> 13:40.887
'cause she could see that
there were people who cared.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.426
All the leads I
got were pure crap

13:48.427 --> 13:51.964
up until two days ago
when the package arrived.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.599
And, at first, I
thought I should

13:53.600 --> 13:55.633
turn it over to the
cops, of course.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.903
But, then, as I looked at
the legal possibilities,

13:58.904 --> 14:00.973
I realized that
nothing would happen.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.910
Person responsible would
go to jail and then what?

14:03.911 --> 14:06.812
Nothing, there
would be no justice.

14:11.283 --> 14:12.885
You like my camera?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.253
It's part of my class.

14:15.254 --> 14:19.023
Well, it's very
professional looking.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.393
That's because
I'm professional.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.894
Oh really?

14:22.895 --> 14:24.230
Really.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.603
Here it goes.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.209
That's actually pretty cool.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.043
Woo hoo!

14:41.514 --> 14:42.413
Whoa!

14:42.414 --> 14:43.415
You okay?

14:43.416 --> 14:44.850
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.487
I've always loved doing that.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.556
I don't know why,
it's just so fun.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.160
It's like, you know,
kinda like I'm flying,

14:56.096 --> 14:57.264
like I'm free,

14:58.298 --> 14:59.599
free from rules,

15:00.767 --> 15:03.236
free from school and
what people think

15:03.237 --> 15:04.837
I'm supposed to be.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.007
Just free!

15:08.140 --> 15:10.309
- Blink.
- One, two, three.

15:25.524 --> 15:26.793
I love it here.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.863
It's my favorite spot.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.338
Um,

15:40.472 --> 15:43.075
my mom has some
rum, maybe some OJ.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.911
And that's it?

15:45.912 --> 15:48.747
Mm, think maybe
some half and half

15:48.748 --> 15:51.082
and cranberry juice.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.917
That's gross.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.152
You're gross.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.022
¶ Somewhere in the kingdom

15:57.023 --> 15:59.591
¶ Of my memory

16:00.626 --> 16:03.995
¶ A mirage of youth

16:03.996 --> 16:07.166
¶ A stream of infancy

16:08.534 --> 16:10.134
You know mom says I'm
not supposed to be

16:10.135 --> 16:12.870
dressin' like this
when I go to school.

16:12.871 --> 16:15.040
Sends the wrong signal.

16:15.041 --> 16:18.377
¶ You give me half
the love I need

16:18.378 --> 16:21.448
I don't deserve this
probably, right?

16:23.416 --> 16:25.417
So quick to agree.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.819
Surprising.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.588
You know, I surprise
myself every day.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.093
¶ A little death to laugh

16:35.894 --> 16:38.196
No, just so you know,

16:38.197 --> 16:40.733
I actually didn't
finish that because

16:40.734 --> 16:44.069
I think when my mom
is saying all that,

16:44.070 --> 16:47.439
she's talking about
most students.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.676
You know, most young girls.

16:51.144 --> 16:54.246
Thing is, I'm not
like most students.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.152
I mean, somebody
has to be different.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.857
Our school, for the most part,

17:05.858 --> 17:08.559
it's pretty uptight,
don't you agree?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.194
Obviously.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.829
That's the consensus
of almost every person

17:11.829 --> 17:13.332
on the planet.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.234
Okay, so let's get
to the more basic,

17:15.236 --> 17:18.237
like every day kind of stuff.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.407
For example, take a
look at my choker.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.509
It's kind of sexy, I know,

17:24.510 --> 17:27.345
maybe too much for some.

17:27.346 --> 17:30.583
But, hey, it's a
choker, and I like it.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.454
I like the pressure on my neck.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.356
Do you really think
I can do that?

17:38.357 --> 17:40.359
That I can tone it down?

17:43.997 --> 17:45.164
I mean, maybe.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.535
I guess I could.

17:50.069 --> 17:50.903
No.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.006
No way.

17:55.875 --> 17:56.709
Really?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.010
I think Jessie Martell does

17:59.011 --> 18:01.680
whatever the hell she wants.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.248
And that's it.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.752
¶ A little death to laugh

18:11.391 --> 18:13.225
About two weeks ago,
I started having

18:13.226 --> 18:15.829
some random stuff happen to me.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.466
The built-in camera on my laptop

18:20.467 --> 18:21.901
lit up by itself.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.240
That's pretty weird, right?

18:29.241 --> 18:32.744
Made me feel like
someone was watching me.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.515
Second thing that happened
was I searched my name,

18:36.516 --> 18:38.316
and, normally, what pops up is

18:38.317 --> 18:41.018
like social network,
normal shit.

18:41.019 --> 18:43.154
But this time, my
name and address

18:43.155 --> 18:45.991
were repeatedly
being highlighted.

18:49.261 --> 18:53.432
So it was obvious that somebody
was trying to track me.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.735
And when I got the packet,

18:56.736 --> 18:59.439
I guess that person
had found me.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.910
Seven months later, I'm
getting ready to do it again,

19:04.911 --> 19:07.179
but this time, I'm by myself.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.181
Here you go, Jessie,
this one's for you.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.487
See that?

19:15.954 --> 19:17.456
Not the best day
for a road trip,

19:17.457 --> 19:19.292
but it's now or never.

19:23.061 --> 19:24.429
By the time you see this,

19:24.430 --> 19:27.033
most of you will
already now who I am.

19:27.034 --> 19:29.700
But for those of you
who are seeing this

19:29.701 --> 19:34.038
for the first time, my
name is Matt Ortega.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.912
Like Mr. Roland said,

19:40.913 --> 19:43.114
"Beginning, middle, and end".

19:43.115 --> 19:44.615
If it was up to me,
I'd go right to the end

19:44.616 --> 19:46.552
and get this over with.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.288
So here it goes.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.624
These are my folks.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.059
And this is my house.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.527
For the record, Matt promised

19:56.528 --> 19:58.597
he'd throw out the trash.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.066
Get on it.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.735
This is our dog Buddy.

20:03.736 --> 20:07.104
Buddy is very loyal, and
that's what makes him the best.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.574
I don't think
they've done it yet

20:08.575 --> 20:09.841
but it's coming

20:09.842 --> 20:12.143
and she's way ahead of him, so...

20:12.144 --> 20:13.711
He doesn't know what to do.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.614
I don't know how
much, you know.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.049
I really, really.

20:21.186 --> 20:23.354
You were supposed
to be helping me.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.289
Remember our deal?

20:25.290 --> 20:28.192
I let you use the car
if you help me clean it.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.562
This is part
of my school project.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.832
Um, Dad, can you loosen up?

20:36.769 --> 20:38.104
Close your eyes.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.742
Okay, now smile.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.945
And then look up at me.

20:47.946 --> 20:51.083
My dad is a good guy,
and he works really hard.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.685
And, like most
parents, he asks me

20:52.686 --> 20:55.921
obvious questions
about life and school

20:55.922 --> 20:57.623
that I don't really
wanna answer.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.559
Like, sometimes,
stuff about Jessie.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.461
I don't think either
of them were happy

21:03.462 --> 21:06.597
about Jessie and
I being together.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.200
For them, she was
trouble, they knew that.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.638
So, in the end, they
kinda left us alone.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.114
No.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.517
I don't wanna.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.190
You don't wanna have sex?

21:34.192 --> 21:36.595
You do wanna have sex?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.197
But you don't want
me to kiss you?

21:38.198 --> 21:39.331
Yeah.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.433
Is that okay?

21:42.035 --> 21:44.335
But that's not normal.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.672
What's normal?

21:46.838 --> 21:50.342
Look, just put your
hand right here.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.344
Now fuck me.
- Stop.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.345
This is weird.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.279
- No.
- Yes.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.150
Just kiss me.

22:13.199 --> 22:14.033
Hit me.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.135
Hit me!

22:18.570 --> 22:20.706
Will you stop this?

22:20.707 --> 22:22.708
Just do it, I like it.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.409
You like it?

22:24.410 --> 22:25.844
Yeah, I don't always want it

22:25.845 --> 22:28.212
to be so lovey-dovey.

22:28.213 --> 22:31.115
That's just how I
feel right now, okay?

22:31.116 --> 22:33.519
Look, it's just make-believe.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.787
You're so weird.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.224
But that's why you love me.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.775
Just say it.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.610
Say it!

22:59.778 --> 23:01.445
Piece of shit.

23:05.017 --> 23:05.852
Whore.

23:07.519 --> 23:08.553
Fuck, Matt.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.157
Fuck, Matt.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.325
Oh, Matt, I love you.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.605
It wasn't like we were
having sex all the time.

23:27.606 --> 23:30.409
Maybe once, twice a day.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.545
But what I remember most
was just that feeling,

23:33.546 --> 23:35.882
that something wasn't right.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.624
Can you just be careful
with that thing, please?

23:45.625 --> 23:48.692
'Cause I told Mr. Roland I
was gonna be responsible.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.430
Look, do you want
everything to be about me?

23:51.431 --> 23:52.596
Some day, you're gonna be like,

23:52.597 --> 23:54.499
"Man, I was kinda cute".

23:54.500 --> 23:56.601
Did you just say kinda?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.236
I didn't wanna be
obvious about it.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.104
Plus, you're not just cute.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.641
I wouldn't want my
man to be just cute.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.241
My man?

24:04.242 --> 24:06.412
Nice.
- You like that, huh?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.656
It's the second time for me.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.026
A day doesn't pass
that I don't wonder,

24:21.027 --> 24:22.594
would she still be here

24:22.595 --> 24:25.431
if I hadn't driven
her down there?

24:31.503 --> 24:33.371
When you look at the
name Leonerd Sawyar,

24:33.372 --> 24:35.105
certain letters were darker.

24:35.106 --> 24:38.443
If you line 'em up,
it spells Leor Sawa.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.581
I looked up the name.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.851
What came up was pure evil.

24:46.419 --> 24:49.688
This freak murdered a
bunch of people in Canada,

24:49.689 --> 24:50.989
got locked up in juvenile,

24:50.990 --> 24:53.458
but somehow was released.

24:53.459 --> 24:55.861
Then, back in '82,
he was arrested again

24:55.862 --> 24:57.496
with some dude named
Barski for murdering

24:57.497 --> 25:00.364
three coeds from the Washington
State Theater School.

25:01.701 --> 25:06.238
He plea-bargained as a
witness against Barski

25:06.239 --> 25:10.241
and was put into a witness
protection program.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.477
It says here his
identity was changed,

25:12.478 --> 25:14.144
and information
regarding his release

25:14.145 --> 25:16.981
was not formally
shared with the public.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.361
You see this blade?

25:29.362 --> 25:32.229
It's pretty sweet, right?

25:32.230 --> 25:36.133
Well, uh, my uncle says
that it's protection

25:36.134 --> 25:40.071
or it keeps me safe or
somethin', I don't know.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.175
But the mistake that people make

25:43.176 --> 25:47.778
is they think that because
this is not very big,

25:47.779 --> 25:49.547
it's not a machete, that
it's not gonna cause

25:49.548 --> 25:50.883
too much damage.

25:58.624 --> 25:59.592
But it will.

26:25.651 --> 26:29.054
Drive sucked a little
bit, it was pretty cold.

26:29.055 --> 26:32.291
But, other than that, I
got here safe and stuff, so

26:32.292 --> 26:33.758
I guess it's all right.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.794
Well that's
good to hear.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.296
Now, son, I know you got this,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.731
but when you get down to LA,

26:40.732 --> 26:43.634
try to do your best and call us.

26:43.635 --> 26:45.537
Please take care of yourself.

26:45.538 --> 26:46.939
All right?
- Yeah.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.970
It just sucked, you know,

27:19.971 --> 27:21.271
'cause I was like losing her,

27:21.272 --> 27:22.273
and she was,

27:23.476 --> 27:26.310
she was goin' away,
and then as soon as,

27:26.311 --> 27:27.812
I was hoping that,

27:29.448 --> 27:31.082
that when she would
go down there,

27:31.083 --> 27:32.450
you know, that things
wouldn't work out,

27:32.451 --> 27:34.219
and that maybe we could
be together in some way

27:34.220 --> 27:36.187
because I really,

27:36.188 --> 27:39.857
I really thought
that at the end of,

27:39.858 --> 27:41.058
I thought that at
the end of things

27:41.059 --> 27:42.826
that it was just
gonna be her and I.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.879
That right?

28:06.384 --> 28:10.556
She was the most
beautiful girl in the world.

28:13.058 --> 28:16.227
When I see those other
pictures or video,

28:16.228 --> 28:18.163
it's just make-believe.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.274
And this is us tryin'
to get to Red Cliff.

29:02.275 --> 29:05.677
Except we didn't get
very far, did we, Matt?

29:05.678 --> 29:09.047
You know, it could help
if you got a flatter rock.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.981
Here ya go.

29:10.982 --> 29:13.117
So, Matt, looks like you, uh,

29:13.118 --> 29:15.385
got some sort of
special technique there.

29:15.386 --> 29:17.788
What do you call that?

29:17.789 --> 29:21.527
Um, this is called
the Let's Hope It Works.

29:23.328 --> 29:24.163
All right.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.133
Right on, Matt!

29:28.134 --> 29:28.968
Woo hoo!

29:30.068 --> 29:32.570
We are now officially unstuck.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.443
See, Matt, this is amazing.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.079
That's the thing
about this world.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.249
It's all here for the taking.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.985
You just have to try.

29:48.686 --> 29:51.689
Jessie, don't talk
to me like that.

29:51.690 --> 29:52.990
What do you mean?

29:52.991 --> 29:55.125
Don't talk to me like that.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.560
Like what?

29:56.561 --> 29:58.429
Like as if I lack
ambition or I don't get it

29:58.430 --> 30:00.666
when, in reality, it's you.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.835
You don't have to
get upset with me.

30:03.836 --> 30:06.005
Well, I'm not trying to.

30:07.472 --> 30:11.742
Some people actually have
to work and go to school.

30:11.743 --> 30:15.914
Well I guess you've got
it all figured out then.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.019
Yay!

30:22.020 --> 30:23.755
Excellente, Mr. Matt.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.296
Can you hear that?

31:40.598 --> 31:42.268
I can hear the wind.

31:43.801 --> 31:44.702
Some birds.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.774
It's incredible.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.880
Thank you so much
for taking me here.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.048
I wanted to.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.420
You know, I

32:03.888 --> 32:05.390
- wanted to...
- What?

32:11.262 --> 32:13.097
We're gonna be okay.

32:14.165 --> 32:16.066
You can always come visit me.

32:16.067 --> 32:19.703
Yeah, and you can
always come visit me.

32:19.704 --> 32:20.538
I will.

32:23.174 --> 32:27.278
Honestly, Jessie, you
shouldn't be going there.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.250
And I think you know that, too.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.557
Hello, Mr. Matt.

32:41.226 --> 32:44.328
What ya
doin' over there?

32:44.329 --> 32:47.966
You whittlin'?

33:23.836 --> 33:25.303
Can I talk to you
about something?

33:25.304 --> 33:26.138
Yeah.

33:31.609 --> 33:34.846
You know, I don't
tell you what to do

33:36.214 --> 33:37.382
or what to say

33:38.317 --> 33:39.550
or where to go.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.019
I don't.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.387
I'm not.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.356
Then what's your problem?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.325
My problem is
that I'm pissed off

33:48.326 --> 33:51.896
that you're moving,
and I'm gonna miss you.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.504
I'm going to miss you so much.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.640
Do you get that?

34:18.657 --> 34:21.759
We're gonna do this my way.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.594
Okay.

34:23.960 --> 34:27.531
And I need you to
know that I love you.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.866
I know you do.

34:30.001 --> 34:30.868
And I don't wanna hit you.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.371
I don't like that.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.208
Okay.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.678
And I don't want
anyone hitting you.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.181
Do you understand?

34:46.150 --> 34:46.984
Yes.

34:48.554 --> 34:49.386
Good.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.542
Ready, Freddy.

35:14.213 --> 35:18.482
In the end, we are
all just regular people.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.151
We are all the same,

35:20.152 --> 35:22.787
but we've got to
do things right.

35:22.788 --> 35:26.924
And what happened to
Jessie wasn't right.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.462
Jessie's body had been
dumped in the morning,

35:32.463 --> 35:34.265
right next to the road.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.866
Just like when people
throw away stuff

35:35.867 --> 35:38.970
that they want the
city to pick up.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.638
There was just garbage
and crap everywhere.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.609
The coroner said that she'd
been strangled with something,

35:44.610 --> 35:46.611
that she had struggled.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.913
There was a lot of other
stuff that happened to Jessie.

35:49.914 --> 35:51.616
I can't talk about it right now.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.732
So how does this all work?

36:08.733 --> 36:11.401
How do rapists, serial
killers, and pedophiles

36:11.402 --> 36:14.404
get released into
society every day?

36:14.405 --> 36:17.475
This sick fuck started
when he was young.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.942
Same old story.

36:18.943 --> 36:22.313
Spent some time in juvie,
then he was out again.

36:24.650 --> 36:28.118
When he got out, he
killed a whole family.

36:28.119 --> 36:31.388
But first he raped and
tortured the children.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.093
This guy murdered his
classmate in France.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.729
He then decided to eat her.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.198
They said he was
mental, so they sent him

36:40.199 --> 36:42.033
back home to Holland.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.935
Afterward, he was let go.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.771
He's free to this day.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.540
Not only do they get out,

36:48.541 --> 36:51.841
but then they have
their own websites.

36:51.842 --> 36:53.511
They sell their art,

36:53.512 --> 36:57.516
and they make it seem
like they are the victims.

36:59.585 --> 37:02.118
This guy killed a
seven-year-old girl.

37:02.119 --> 37:04.421
He was sentenced to
death 15 years ago,

37:04.422 --> 37:06.323
but the state law changed.

37:06.324 --> 37:07.959
He's now a free man.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.894
Makes no fuckin' sense.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.163
¶ Eyes lit

37:12.164 --> 37:14.232
¶ I want short breaths

37:14.233 --> 37:17.501
¶ I found dark eyelids

37:19.204 --> 37:20.370
¶ Nice breasts

37:20.371 --> 37:22.138
¶ Like the summer

37:22.139 --> 37:24.975
¶ Into rough hands

37:24.976 --> 37:27.377
This is for you, Mr. Roland.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.678
I would like to thank you

37:28.679 --> 37:30.147
for letting me
check the camera out

37:30.148 --> 37:32.783
as many times as I did.

37:32.784 --> 37:36.319
You always asked us to
be honest and genuine.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.256
This is me trying my hardest.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.324
So thank you.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.194
¶ Eyes lit

37:44.195 --> 37:46.296
¶ I want short breaths

37:46.297 --> 37:50.067
¶ I found dark eyelids

37:50.068 --> 37:51.803
So, I'm sorry,
I'm a little lost.

37:51.804 --> 37:54.904
I, I can't find my hotel
because I'm not from here.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.506
- Your hotel?
- Yeah.

37:56.507 --> 37:58.009
How long you here for?

37:58.010 --> 37:59.709
- A couple days.
- A couple days?

37:59.710 --> 38:00.877
Yeah, well, more like one day.

38:00.878 --> 38:01.812
You've gotta stay longer.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.381
A day, it's nothing in Vegas.

38:03.382 --> 38:06.317
What's around here?

38:06.318 --> 38:09.988
I don't understand
why you had to ask her.

38:11.188 --> 38:12.957
There were plenty
of people around.

38:12.958 --> 38:13.892
You could've asked anybody.

38:13.893 --> 38:16.960
She was standing right there.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.629
Did you enjoy
flirting with her?

38:18.630 --> 38:19.463
What?

38:20.865 --> 38:23.466
Is that how it's going to be?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.970
You're the one who
flirts with everybody.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.939
No, I don't, I don't do
it right in front of you.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.374
So you do it behind my back?

38:30.375 --> 38:33.176
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

38:33.177 --> 38:34.611
Then what are you saying?

38:34.612 --> 38:37.013
I don't know, I, you know,

38:37.014 --> 38:40.151
you just really piss me off.

39:13.050 --> 39:16.319
This is the agency
ad that Jessie answered.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.154
She sent them her pictures,

39:18.155 --> 39:19.989
and they loved them.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.625
She could model, make money,

39:21.626 --> 39:23.326
live in Hollywood.

39:23.327 --> 39:26.296
It was a dream come
true for Jessie.

39:26.297 --> 39:29.133
I didn't know who this
Christiane or Maurice were,

39:29.134 --> 39:32.070
but it just didn't
seem real to me.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.506
Ta da!

39:35.507 --> 39:36.874
Finally.

39:36.875 --> 39:37.942
Check the back?

39:37.943 --> 39:38.776
Yes.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.544
Your cell?

39:40.545 --> 39:42.047
Where's my cell?

39:44.115 --> 39:45.182
Oh, found it.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.299
Well, hello there.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.435
Nice of you to join us.

40:04.436 --> 40:06.270
What brings you here?

40:06.271 --> 40:08.272
I'm actually here
to see Maurice.

40:08.273 --> 40:09.540
My name is Jessie.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.942
We just got in from Colorado.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.511
You're a model, right?

40:13.512 --> 40:15.212
Yes, I am.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.781
Love the choker.

40:16.782 --> 40:17.982
Thank you.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.015
And you are?

40:19.016 --> 40:21.419
Model's boyfriend.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.886
All right, let's
see what we can do.

40:22.887 --> 40:23.721
Follow me.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.359
And this is Ashley.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.062
If you're very, very bad,

40:32.063 --> 40:34.765
he might give you an interview.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.436
Have you seen Christiane around?

40:45.277 --> 40:47.278
Hello, I'm Christiane.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.915
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

40:53.518 --> 40:57.255
You look more natural
than in the pictures.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.525
I love your nose.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.097
You must be Matt.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.767
Well, we've been expecting you.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.770
Let's put your bags away.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.270
Follow me.

41:14.271 --> 41:16.473
I think you'll
really love it here.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.143
People are warm and open-minded.

41:20.144 --> 41:20.978
Hello.

41:23.347 --> 41:24.181
Hello.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.588
Welcome, make yourself at home.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.691
Those are all your bags?

41:33.692 --> 41:35.593
You travel light.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.428
Uh, we have some
more in the car.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.196
I see.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.397
Who's that?

41:40.398 --> 41:42.300
- It's Rocky.
- Come in.

41:48.773 --> 41:52.743
- You all right?
- Yes, everything just fine.

41:52.744 --> 41:56.046
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.547
Oh, this is Matt.

41:57.548 --> 41:58.816
This is Jessie.

41:58.817 --> 41:59.985
Matt, Jessie.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.919
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.256
- I'll see you later.
- 'Kay.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.160
Protection.

42:17.434 --> 42:19.569
Matt, be cool.

42:19.570 --> 42:21.639
This is fucking insane.

42:46.331 --> 42:48.531
That afternoon was a blur.

42:48.532 --> 42:51.535
We had drinks and
hung out by the pool.

42:51.536 --> 42:55.539
Christiane introduced us
to her partner Maurice.

42:56.974 --> 43:00.310
It was like we were in some
crazy-ass cartoon or something.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.580
They made it sound like
Jessie was on easy street.

43:02.581 --> 43:04.047
Hey, Matt.

43:04.048 --> 43:06.383
She already
had two bookings.

43:06.384 --> 43:09.720
It was all so quick.
- Wow, look at her.

43:09.721 --> 43:11.788
- You new in town?
- I am.

43:11.789 --> 43:13.156
I'm from Colorado actually.

43:13.157 --> 43:14.758
Well you two have
to be best friends.

43:14.759 --> 43:16.292
She's one of my favorites.

43:30.342 --> 43:31.174
All right, which one you had

43:31.175 --> 43:32.276
the, uh, roofies?

43:32.277 --> 43:34.544
- Uh, that would be her.
- Okay, yeah,

43:34.545 --> 43:35.712
that's what I thought.
- I love roofies.

43:35.713 --> 43:36.913
I'm kidding.

43:36.914 --> 43:38.281
You didn't think I
was serious, did you?

43:38.282 --> 43:40.684
She is going to do so well.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.821
She's got something in her eyes,

43:43.822 --> 43:46.157
beautiful smile, great vibe.

43:47.092 --> 43:49.225
You put all of it together,

43:49.226 --> 43:52.261
well, she could go the distance,

43:52.262 --> 43:54.698
She talk to you at
all about what I do?

43:54.699 --> 43:55.767
- Um.
- I was telling her.

43:55.768 --> 43:57.000
- Yeah.
- Kind of.

43:57.001 --> 43:59.102
I mean, I make
art, I'm an artist.

43:59.103 --> 44:01.038
- You know?
- He's brilliant.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.573
Thank you.

44:02.574 --> 44:03.806
You are.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.042
But I want it to be
beautiful, you know?

44:05.043 --> 44:06.442
I want my art to be beautiful.

44:06.443 --> 44:07.377
Yeah.

44:07.378 --> 44:09.245
And I think you can bring

44:09.246 --> 44:10.913
beauty to my art.

44:10.914 --> 44:13.616
You know, your
girlfriend's really sexy.

44:13.617 --> 44:15.084
Thank you.

44:15.085 --> 44:16.020
So are you.

44:18.123 --> 44:19.890
Thank you for saying that.

44:19.891 --> 44:23.061
I'm not just saying
that, I mean it.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.562
I knew right from the start

44:26.563 --> 44:27.731
there was this

44:29.134 --> 44:30.034
connection.

44:31.469 --> 44:33.870
Because
people need to, to dream.

44:33.871 --> 44:36.573
They need to, to imagine.

44:36.574 --> 44:38.042
That's what I say.

44:38.043 --> 44:42.680
Yeah, it's
like a moving picture show.

44:42.681 --> 44:43.581
Dreams can,

44:45.182 --> 44:48.519
can loop around and
around in your head.

44:49.753 --> 44:51.855
And we're attracted to it.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.758
Yeah, we're attracted to that.

44:53.759 --> 44:57.428
It's like a, it's kinda
like a golden light.

44:59.097 --> 45:00.031
It drives us

45:02.500 --> 45:04.735
until we make it a reality.

45:06.371 --> 45:07.971
Most people think that's crazy,

45:07.972 --> 45:09.040
- but it's not.
- I don't think

45:09.041 --> 45:11.207
that's crazy at all.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.142
Neither do I.

45:13.143 --> 45:16.480
You know, you just
have to stay focused.

45:17.949 --> 45:18.782
How?

45:20.452 --> 45:24.456
Well,
you gotta believe it.

46:20.043 --> 46:21.812
Well say something.

46:23.614 --> 46:24.448
Okay.

46:28.253 --> 46:30.421
How did you like the trip?

46:33.224 --> 46:34.292
It was fun.

46:37.161 --> 46:37.995
Actually,

46:41.166 --> 46:42.432
it was amazing.

46:48.139 --> 46:50.307
I'll always remember this.

46:51.208 --> 46:52.710
Forever.
- Forever?

46:58.182 --> 46:59.784
Not just the trip.

47:02.653 --> 47:06.556
Like, I'll always
remember you and me.

47:06.557 --> 47:09.827
And everything that
we've been through.

47:11.396 --> 47:12.230
So, yeah,

47:14.998 --> 47:15.833
forever.

47:21.371 --> 47:24.274
Wherever we are,
it doesn't matter.

47:25.376 --> 47:27.210
We're always together, right?

47:40.724 --> 47:42.460
Hey, that Christiane.

47:44.528 --> 47:46.062
How crazy was that?

47:46.063 --> 47:49.566
I couldn't believe
what she was saying.

47:49.567 --> 47:52.401
It's like she wouldn't stop.

47:52.402 --> 47:57.140
I mean, how many times
do you have to say no?

47:57.141 --> 47:58.876
Like fifty million.

48:00.010 --> 48:02.447
And even that's not enough.

48:04.047 --> 48:05.115
I love you.

48:06.818 --> 48:08.152
Love you, too.

48:13.557 --> 48:14.726
Here you go.

48:15.927 --> 48:16.760
Thanks.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.407
Well we better get goin'.

48:32.744 --> 48:33.577
Okay.

48:37.215 --> 48:40.116
After I left
LA, we took a break.

48:40.117 --> 48:42.352
I just wanted her
to do her thing.

48:42.353 --> 48:43.788
And that she did.

48:55.199 --> 48:57.769
I like
the pressure on my neck.

48:57.770 --> 49:01.370
¶ As we fall into sequence

49:01.371 --> 49:05.042
¶ And we're eating our young

49:05.043 --> 49:08.712
¶ Remain silent and still for

49:43.947 --> 49:44.948
Fuckin' love it.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.753
All right, let's
get you over here.

49:53.490 --> 49:56.827
Oh yeah.

50:01.132 --> 50:02.933
Let's get you over here.

50:02.934 --> 50:04.201
All right, face me a little bit.

50:04.202 --> 50:06.204
Yeah, there ya go, good.

50:07.704 --> 50:11.475
Good, good.

50:11.476 --> 50:12.408
Stick it out.

50:12.409 --> 50:13.243
Yeah, that's it.

50:13.244 --> 50:14.412
Can you squat?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.348
Okay, this is what I wanna do.

50:18.349 --> 50:21.151
Just keep that wide, yeah.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.887
Keep that wide, yeah.

50:24.755 --> 50:25.589
All right.

50:26.657 --> 50:28.325
Open your mouth, baby.

50:28.326 --> 50:30.960
Yeah, okay, this
is gonna be like,

50:30.961 --> 50:34.598
be like, yeah,
that's it, that's it.

50:34.599 --> 50:36.133
Yeah, got it?

50:36.134 --> 50:37.068
Okay, good.

50:38.335 --> 50:39.935
Keep it open.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.243
Can I close my mouth now?

50:47.244 --> 50:48.611
No, no, no, keep it open.

50:48.612 --> 50:50.047
It's really sexy.

50:53.951 --> 50:55.887
Okay, can you stand up?

50:57.454 --> 50:58.855
What's your name?

51:00.224 --> 51:01.424
Uh, it's Lacey,

51:01.425 --> 51:04.727
and, actually, I just turned 18.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.897
I got this as a present.

51:06.898 --> 51:07.899
You like it?

51:09.067 --> 51:10.568
Yeah, I like it.

51:11.635 --> 51:15.439
It's not your
birthday suit, though.

51:15.440 --> 51:18.075
That's what you have
when you take that off.

51:20.510 --> 51:21.746
You're funny.

51:22.947 --> 51:24.682
Yeah, you think so?

51:28.985 --> 51:30.654
You think I'm funny?

51:35.159 --> 51:36.227
What are you?

51:37.228 --> 51:38.396
Are you sassy?

51:40.530 --> 51:42.466
You're a fighter?

51:42.467 --> 51:43.634
Like to fight?

51:45.802 --> 51:46.902
Yeah, I can be a
real prick, too.

51:46.903 --> 51:49.272
You wanna see that?

51:49.273 --> 51:50.640
Not really.

51:50.641 --> 51:53.109
I mean, I guess you kind
of have to be, right?

51:53.110 --> 51:55.145
You don't wanna get
walked all over.

51:55.146 --> 51:58.381
Everybody likes
a little fight.

51:58.382 --> 51:59.916
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

52:00.818 --> 52:02.753
Otherwise, it's no fun.

52:08.925 --> 52:10.392
Nice.

52:10.393 --> 52:13.830
That's it.

52:14.865 --> 52:17.134
You got a boyfriend out here?

52:17.135 --> 52:19.537
Um, yeah, he's in Colorado.

52:21.771 --> 52:25.308
What's he think
about all this?

52:25.309 --> 52:26.544
I'm not sure.

52:47.364 --> 52:51.535
As for her pictures,
that didn't bother me.

52:54.771 --> 52:56.773
In fact, they were good.

53:02.713 --> 53:05.383
It was more about the people
she was hanging out with.

53:11.088 --> 53:12.823
I didn't like any of them.

53:17.594 --> 53:19.863
They were just so fake.

53:24.235 --> 53:26.102
So she was working?

53:26.103 --> 53:28.705
Yes, she was, at first.

53:28.706 --> 53:32.107
Then we started getting
offers from our, uh,

53:32.108 --> 53:35.111
older and more
established clients.

53:35.112 --> 53:37.480
She wasn't into it.

53:37.481 --> 53:40.218
So there wasn't
much we could do.

53:41.885 --> 53:44.020
What kind of offers?

53:44.021 --> 53:46.591
Well, you know, harder stuff.

53:47.791 --> 53:49.292
All right.

53:49.293 --> 53:51.527
When Jessie first got here,

53:51.528 --> 53:54.863
you called her a few
times, looking for her,

53:54.864 --> 53:56.800
and, uh, well, she, uh,

54:00.938 --> 54:03.305
she never got the messages.

54:03.306 --> 54:05.207
Why didn't she
get those messages?

54:05.208 --> 54:06.676
I'm telling you,
I'm very sorry

54:06.677 --> 54:09.511
about what happened
to Jessie, okay?

54:09.512 --> 54:11.781
But I'm trying to be
straight with you here,

54:11.782 --> 54:13.216
doing you a favor.

54:13.217 --> 54:15.653
I don't need you to
start freaking out on me.

54:15.654 --> 54:17.787
You know, every day so
many girls come here

54:17.788 --> 54:21.223
from buses and trains
and wherever the fuck,

54:21.224 --> 54:22.926
and most of them
know they have to do

54:22.927 --> 54:25.462
whatever it takes to make it.

54:25.463 --> 54:29.098
Some of the girls get it
quick, and some don't.

54:29.099 --> 54:32.769
Jessie sent us, uh, her
photos and wrote us,

54:34.105 --> 54:37.841
and how she wasn't
shy and she was,

54:37.842 --> 54:38.943
she was free,

54:40.844 --> 54:43.413
but when it came down to it,

54:43.414 --> 54:46.649
she was just this little girl.

54:50.253 --> 54:52.288
It's all the same shit.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.857
They build you up and
then they tear you down.

54:54.858 --> 54:57.493
Then people act like they
never knew that person.

54:57.494 --> 54:59.063
It is all bullshit.

55:00.231 --> 55:02.232
In this case, people
knew about Jessie

55:02.233 --> 55:04.533
and what happened to her.

55:04.534 --> 55:06.835
I met her on a photo shoot,

55:06.836 --> 55:07.672
and

55:09.039 --> 55:11.207
I just worked with
her that one day.

55:11.208 --> 55:13.576
I don't make it a
point to know their names

55:13.577 --> 55:15.645
or know much about them.

55:15.646 --> 55:18.580
What I can tell you
is that she was sweet.

55:23.586 --> 55:24.854
So we are here with Lacey,

55:24.855 --> 55:26.955
who is the new it
girl on the block.

55:26.956 --> 55:28.625
Thanks for takin' the time.
- No prob.

55:28.626 --> 55:30.294
Uh, so let's start
with the basics, right?

55:30.295 --> 55:32.861
First off, look at
you, you look stunning.

55:32.862 --> 55:34.596
Mm hmm, thank you.

55:34.597 --> 55:35.999
For sure.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.466
Oh, thank you so much.

55:37.467 --> 55:38.734
You're welcome.

55:38.735 --> 55:40.569
Looks like you are
really keeping busy.

55:40.570 --> 55:44.006
- Yeah, I am.
- Seems like you fit right in.

55:44.007 --> 55:46.375
Yeah, I mean, the
outfits are really sexy

55:46.376 --> 55:48.578
and the pictures are super cute.

55:48.579 --> 55:49.913
So tell me about this layout.

55:49.914 --> 55:52.816
Uh, well, we are doing
a whole punk rock thing

55:52.817 --> 55:55.118
mixed with a 1940s vibe.

55:55.119 --> 55:56.652
It's super cool.

55:56.653 --> 55:59.855
One way or another, there's
always a damsel in distress,

55:59.856 --> 56:01.290
which is me.

56:01.291 --> 56:02.792
I know that you're
gettin' tied up.

56:02.793 --> 56:05.694
You know, I do, I get tied up,

56:05.695 --> 56:07.629
and people love it.

56:07.630 --> 56:09.999
So it kinda makes me feel

56:10.000 --> 56:12.035
normal, in a way.

56:12.036 --> 56:15.904
And you get to have all these
beautiful friends with you.

56:15.905 --> 56:18.475
- Exactly.
- Any other news?

56:18.476 --> 56:19.808
Just try to keep busy

56:19.809 --> 56:21.710
and, uh, just
saving up some money

56:21.711 --> 56:23.245
so I can go home for a while

56:23.246 --> 56:25.714
just to check up on some things.

56:25.715 --> 56:28.917
You miss back home?

56:28.918 --> 56:31.989
There is someone
that I miss a lot.

56:33.090 --> 56:35.058
But you are
coming back, right?

56:35.059 --> 56:36.158
I will.

56:36.159 --> 56:37.794
- I mean, you promise.
- I promise.

56:55.378 --> 56:59.114
This was the last
time that I talked to Jessie.

56:59.115 --> 57:00.717
It wasn't in person.

57:02.619 --> 57:03.953
But it was good.

57:07.590 --> 57:10.827
We should talk when
I get home, okay?

57:15.599 --> 57:17.835
It's cool out here and all,

57:18.802 --> 57:19.636
but

57:21.005 --> 57:21.838
there are

57:23.206 --> 57:24.541
a lot of freaks.

57:29.346 --> 57:30.414
I don't know.

57:31.648 --> 57:33.549
It's just, like,

57:33.550 --> 57:35.552
everyone's got an angle.

57:36.954 --> 57:41.223
You know, like everyone's
telling me to do this or that.

57:41.224 --> 57:44.861
Well if it doesn't
feel right, don't do it.

57:44.862 --> 57:46.729
Don't listen to them, okay?

57:46.730 --> 57:47.565
Well,

57:49.867 --> 57:53.770
it's not easy when you're
like this pathetic moth

57:53.771 --> 57:55.538
in front of this bright light.

57:55.539 --> 57:57.041
It, it's just not.

58:01.512 --> 58:03.780
Hey, thanks for the advice,

58:05.215 --> 58:07.116
and just do me a favor,

58:09.452 --> 58:12.456
just don't make me
look like a dork.

58:14.824 --> 58:15.658
That trip.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.662
I was such a mess.

58:22.465 --> 58:25.469
I got all mad when
I shouldn't have.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.172
And I'm sorry.

58:31.208 --> 58:33.543
Don't worry, I'll be cool.

58:37.081 --> 58:38.516
You know, Jessie,

58:39.717 --> 58:42.152
you don't have to stay in LA.

58:43.753 --> 58:44.989
Just come home.

58:52.128 --> 58:53.697
I love you, Matt.

58:56.367 --> 58:59.103
I love
you, too, Jessie.

59:01.371 --> 59:02.205
Bye.

59:19.056 --> 59:20.057
Her Honda
had been abandoned

59:20.058 --> 59:21.591
in a motel parking lot.

59:21.592 --> 59:22.859
She was supposed
to do a photo shoot

59:22.860 --> 59:26.296
three days earlier,
but she didn't show up.

59:26.297 --> 59:27.629
Her agency thought she flaked

59:27.630 --> 59:30.098
and didn't report her missing.

59:30.099 --> 59:32.901
This is the room where
Jessie was staying.

59:32.902 --> 59:34.870
Christiane, the lady
from the agency,

59:34.871 --> 59:35.805
said that Jessie got pissed

59:35.806 --> 59:37.839
and bailed from the place.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:23.779
My mom
says we're just asking for it.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.049
Asking for it.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:42.065
Come catch me, come
catch me, come catch me.

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.100
I love you, Matt.

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:53.241
Ever since
I got the package,

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:56.813
it's been hard to keep
everything in check.

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.281
All I had to go on was a frame

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:01.585
that I pulled from the tape.

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:05.122
As I look at everything
in this room,

01:02:05.123 --> 01:02:07.589
all I keep thinking
about is Jessie.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.334
And now,

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:20.237
somehow these memories,

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:24.508
they're all getting
mixed up together.

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:31.279
I feel terrible about
what happened to your girl.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.383
It's really, really
hard for me to talk about.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:35.719
She was sweet,

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.321
but broken.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.631
She is
going to do so well.

01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.098
Man, I don't concern myself

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.134
with what other
people are doing.

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.102
My focus is mainly
on what I'm doing.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:56.171
I don't have time
for that other shit.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.607
I take pictures, okay?

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.942
That's what I do.

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:05.647
Some people like my
shit, some don't.

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.482
It's not my problem.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.461
How the hell did
all of this happen?

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:20.631
I wish that I could say
her dad and I were better,

01:03:20.632 --> 01:03:21.864
but we weren't.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.870
Still, Jessie had to
know that I loved her.

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:31.374
She had to know that.
- She did, she knew that.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:34.210
She talked about
you all the time.

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.351
She didn't have to go.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.927
How are things going for you?

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:54.596
No one wants to talk yet.

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.833
Yeah, well, we knew that.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.703
That's what happens when
you're dealing with scum.

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:03.638
Sick, sick people
who know, they know,

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:06.142
and it's gonna come back to them

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:06.976
because

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.812
people make mistakes, and
they will get found out

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:13.583
for what they did
to my daughter.

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.421
Matt, I gotta go.

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:21.591
I gotta go, honey.

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.071
There's no
gun shown, okay?

01:04:34.072 --> 01:04:35.404
No gun involved.

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:40.343
Can you
describe what you saw?

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:42.143
I just looked over

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.248
and saw her in the ditch.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:46.549
I thought

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.485
that's a little girl.

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:55.958
And I thought, who would
ever do something like this?

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:03.633
When I first got
this, I checked around,

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:06.902
but there was nothing
on Leonerd Sawyar.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:10.538
It was like he was a
ghost or something.

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:11.707
Then, out of the blue,

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:13.943
I got this through my blog.

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:17.247
After trading a
couple of emails,

01:05:17.248 --> 01:05:20.049
we agreed to meet up
when I got in town.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:23.051
I couldn't tell
Jessie's mom about this,

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:26.056
the tape, or anything
about my trip.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:38.033
This was the only person that
I was able to connect with

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:42.105
that actually knew anything
about Leonerd Sawyar.

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:52.915
Listen, I
can't stay long,

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:54.984
so let's get to business.

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:56.787
Do you have my little donation?

01:05:56.788 --> 01:05:58.221
Yeah, I got it.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:04.292
- All right, can we start?
- Do you have the address?

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.195
Are you 100% sure?

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:10.032
How do you know?

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.703
Why are you
getting into my shit?

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:18.708
- Because it's important.
- Then let's get to it.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.754
All right.

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:42.599
This dude Leonerd, the
guy that lives here,

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:50.139
as far as anybody knows,
he's just an amateur.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:55.245
But if he really is this Leor
Sawa person like you say,

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:01.585
then I don't have any
problem passing this on.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:11.727
You know, people get to do
whatever they want around here.

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.896
But not that kind of shit.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.202
Do you know how he met Jessie?

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:30.579
People meet up
all kinds of ways.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:36.052
They get drawn to certain stuff.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.754
Listen,

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:43.527
that's all I got, this is it.

01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:15.025
This is where
they found Jessie's body.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.566
It's about five miles
from the address

01:08:22.567 --> 01:08:24.666
that I'm holding in my hand.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:47.921
Are you coming

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.359
or are you just
gonna stand there?

01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:56.599
This is the address.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.701
2246 Entrada.

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:04.640
My first thought was,
it seems too quiet.

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:08.778
I didn't hear any
birds, nothing.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.946
It was like somebody
took a switch

01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:13.048
and turned the sound off.

01:09:14.885 --> 01:09:18.386
All I could think
of was, stay put.

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:19.889
Don't move.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:23.393
Just wait till somebody
finally comes out.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.362
And then someone did.

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:24.854
Do
you see that in your mind?

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.094
As I watched
him standing there,

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:41.164
it seemed as if
everything froze in time.

01:11:41.165 --> 01:11:42.363
It was now or never

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:45.734
because all I wanted
was for this to be over.

01:12:13.063 --> 01:12:15.130
You look
scared, Matthew.

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:16.066
Fuck you.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.372
And you're bleeding.

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:28.544
Well, no, no matter, you,
you're here now, right?

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:30.279
And your camera, too.

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:34.550
Now why don't you
just gimme the knife

01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:37.385
so we can do this right?

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:40.188
You're still gonna get
what you came here for.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:44.859
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.463
If, if I'd wanted to kill ya,

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:52.235
I'd have killed
you already, right?

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:57.939
I mean, back at the
hotel, I saw you.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.774
All alone.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:01.378
Typing, sleeping.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:06.281
Dreaming about your girl.

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:07.784
Don't talk about Jessie.

01:13:07.785 --> 01:13:09.852
You don't know
anything about her.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:11.087
Oh, but I do.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.057
The very first day

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.326
you came here,

01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:22.363
you left her alone at the party.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.300
She was looking for ya.

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:27.502
She was looking for you,

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.604
but, no, 'cause
you were too busy,

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:33.509
you were too busy with
that, that lady friend.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.344
No.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:39.214
Oh yes, 'cause
that's how we met.

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:41.716
You're full of shit.

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.987
Yeah, I know
it's hard, it's a,

01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:47.755
but you gotta understand,

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:51.393
there's nothing,
nothing you could do.

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:53.896
Mm mm, it was all predestined.

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.332
I know because,

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:01.604
because she imagined me.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:04.406
And I imagined her.

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:07.911
And that's how it happens.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.347
I saw it in her eyes.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.431
Just like the others.

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:40.008
It's not what I wanted.

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:42.511
But this, too, is meant to be.

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:46.215
Now get outta here.

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:49.185
Get back, outta the way.

01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:53.456
Make sure that thing
is still running.

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:56.125
'Cause every picture

01:14:58.127 --> 01:15:00.230
should have a good ending.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.336
My time is up.

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:10.205
There is nothing
left for me to see.

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:23.918
Oh my God!

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.915
I'm not sure that
something dark like this

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.351
can ever go away.

01:16:31.988 --> 01:16:35.189
Leor Sawa made me his witness,

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:38.327
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:41.331
But I do know we
can't hide from it.

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.269
People need to understand

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:48.471
this does exist.

01:16:52.675 --> 01:16:55.345
This is where Jessie was killed.

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:57.980
In a basement

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:01.317
in a house

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.255
just like any other
house on a street

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:10.592
that could be yours or mine.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:19.100
I've made a lot of mistakes,

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.469
and I can't change that.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.871
But I was right
about this trip back

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:25.975
and everything that
was a part of it.

01:17:29.545 --> 01:17:31.880
My memories of Jessie
will always be the same.

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:35.584
Beautiful.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.010
Where are you taking me?

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.879
Don't worry about it.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.181
Just walk straight that way.

01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:13.255
Do you know
where we're going?

01:18:13.256 --> 01:18:14.557
Yeah, almost there.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:40.717
Thank you, Matt.

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:43.786
Thank you so much.

01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:51.827
I love you, Matt.

Subrip by DanDee

01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:22.943
You see this rock?

01:21:22.944 --> 01:21:24.779
I want you to keep it.

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:27.948
And when I'm not with you,

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.885
you can feel like I am.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.318
¶ Everything change

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:06.688
¶ And we'll all change again

01:22:06.689 --> 01:22:08.156
¶ Sun sheds the light

01:22:08.157 --> 01:22:10.591
¶ As the life sheds the skin

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:11.859
¶ You kiss your wish

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.295
¶ To the heart of the world

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:16.096
¶ Secrets are safe with

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:20.335
¶ Will not break the spell

01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:23.971
¶ Come on, let's go home

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:27.675
¶ Buried in your womb

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:31.679
¶ Sing a song of death

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.648
¶ Till there's none left

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:35.282
¶ Love comes close

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:37.419
¶ But chooses to spare me

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.187
¶ Death comes close

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:41.255
¶ But ceases to take me

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:43.023
¶ I want to twist

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:44.925

¶ Look outside

¶ World is exploding

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.635
¶ Stay inside

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.603
¶ Still never knowing

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:58.473
¶ Taking cover

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.442
¶ With each other

01:23:00.443 --> 01:23:01.809
¶ Sleeping off

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.980
¶ The century of hope

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:21.395
¶ Every day's changing

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:23.531
¶ Will remain the same

01:23:23.532 --> 01:23:24.933
¶ Silhouettes shy

01:23:24.934 --> 01:23:27.368
¶ As the rain rots the drain

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:29.004
¶ Every day's decay

01:23:29.005 --> 01:23:31.072
¶ Debases the dream

01:23:31.073 --> 01:23:32.874
¶ The ghosts that will haunt you

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:36.944
¶ Are not what they seem

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:40.749
¶ Still you say you're dead

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:43.351
¶ To depravity

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.889
¶ But that can't be true

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:50.425
