Have you taken care of McBain?

You don't have to worry,
Senator Mendoza.

00:58.500 --> 01:02.270
By now, our dear friend,
McBain, has met with a

unfortunate accident.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.750

Excellent.
With McBain out of the way,

$2.50 for this?

01:37.310 --> 01:38.680
What a gyp.

01:38.740 --> 01:41.040
You certainly broke up
that meeting.

Right now, I'm thinking about

How do you know unless you
opened your eyes
during the blessing?

02:40.870 --> 02:42.300
Eating is worse
than opening eyes.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.030
Is not.
Is too.

02:43.110 --> 02:45.110
Is too.
Is not.

Quiet you kids! If I hear
one more word, Bart doesn't
get to watch cartoons

Hello?

03:17.480 --> 03:19.580
Oh, my God!

03:19.650 --> 03:21.120
Homer, I'm happy to say

03:21.180 --> 03:23.750
your father only had
a mild arrhythmia.

03:23.820 --> 03:25.290
Mild?!

03:25.350 --> 03:28.290
There wasn't anything

03:28.350 --> 03:31.750
Now get back to the pharmacy,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.220
Oh, with that

03:34.290 --> 03:35.950
you'll bury us all

03:37.630 --> 03:38.800
Oh.

03:38.860 --> 03:41.260
Pull your chair
closer, my son.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.830
What is it, Dad?

03:42.900 --> 03:44.910
P.U., not that close!

03:44.970 --> 03:46.570
Eesh!

03:46.640 --> 03:50.210
Homer, that heart attack
made me realize

03:50.280 --> 03:53.050
that I'm going to die someday.

03:53.110 --> 03:55.750
Oh, Dad,

03:55.810 --> 03:58.580
There's something
I think you should know.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.920
Homer, you have
a half brother.

04:00.990 --> 04:01.920
A half brother?

04:01.990 --> 04:03.320
Uh-huh.

04:03.390 --> 04:06.560
It happened when
I was courting your mother.

for me.</i>

04:28.180 --> 04:31.620
We left the baby
at the Shelbyville Orphanage

04:31.680 --> 04:34.180
and I never
saw him again.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.920

your mother, and we had you.</i>

04:39.220 --> 04:41.290
I want Homer to grow up
respecting his father.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.600
He must never know
about that carnival incident.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.460
Okay.

04:45.530 --> 04:46.870
Promise you won't tell him.

04:46.930 --> 04:48.240
I promise.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.300
Whoops!

04:49.370 --> 04:52.240
Forget what I
just told you.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.070
What are you
blubbering about?

04:54.140 --> 04:56.680
This makes me feel
special, Dad.

04:56.740 --> 04:59.410
Since I'm the one you kept,
that must mean you
really love me.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.120
Hmm... interesting theory.

05:02.180 --> 05:05.590
I'm going to find
my brother. I don't
care what it takes.

If I have to move
Heaven and Earth,
I'm going to find him.

Yeah, right. Good luck.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.220
Can you tell me his name?

06:07.280 --> 06:09.580
According to our records,
a Mr. And Mrs. Powell
adopted your brother

06:09.650 --> 06:12.090
and named him Herbert.

06:12.150 --> 06:13.550
Herbert! Herbert Powell!

06:13.620 --> 06:15.590
Great. Where can I find him?

06:15.650 --> 06:18.180
I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to
release that information.

could be anywhere.

If you ask me, the city

07:47.950 --> 07:49.080

From the Shelbyville Orphanage?

07:59.490 --> 08:01.500
How did you know that?

08:01.560 --> 08:03.460
Because...

Knock it off,
I'm here.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.800
I'm just silent because
of the emotion involved.

08:13.870 --> 08:14.910
Oh, sorry.

08:14.970 --> 08:16.530
Homer, I think
we need to get together.

08:16.610 --> 08:18.350
Okay, brother.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.180
Grab the next plane to
Springfield. We got a couch
that folds out.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.020
I'll tell you what.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.920
Why don't you come here?

Bart and Lisa:
Are we there yet?

08:28.550 --> 08:29.950
Are we there yet?
Just a little furth--

08:30.020 --> 08:32.490
Are we--
Just a little further!

08:32.559 --> 08:36.200
Bart! Lisa! If you don't behave,
we'll turn this car right around
and go home.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.200
But, Marge

08:37.260 --> 08:39.260
I want to see my brother.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.870
For God's sakes, Homer,
it's an empty threat.

Oh. D-ohhh!

08:51.980 --> 08:53.580
I didn't know it was you.

08:53.650 --> 08:54.850
That's okay.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.610
Carry on.

See the way
I handled that, Marge?

Wow! What are you
doing here?

D-aw!! Every day
we're losing ground
to the Japanese,

and I wanna know why?

Unfair
trade practices?

Mushy-headed
one-worlders

09:19.970 --> 09:21.240

09:21.310 --> 09:22.840
Some sort of Gypsy curse?

09:22.910 --> 09:24.010
I'm tired of excuses.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.580
Why did I ever hire
you Harvard deadheads?

09:26.650 --> 09:28.020
Because you went there, sir.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.050
Yeah, but Mommy and Daddy
didn't pay <i>my way.</i>

09:31.120 --> 09:32.320
I had to work my way through

09:32.380 --> 09:33.480
washing your dishes

09:33.550 --> 09:34.920
and scrubbing
your toilets.

09:34.990 --> 09:36.320
Now I remember you.

09:36.390 --> 09:38.830
Have you come up with a name for
our new economy model?

09:38.890 --> 09:40.090
You're gonna love this,
chief--

09:40.160 --> 09:41.760
The Persephone.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.160
Persephone?

09:43.230 --> 09:45.830
What the hell kind of name
is Persephone?

09:45.900 --> 09:48.640
She was the Greek goddess
of spring and rebirth.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.000
D-ohhh!

09:50.070 --> 09:51.870
And get this sir. She was
carried off to Hades

09:51.940 --> 09:53.340
by the king of the
underworld.

09:53.410 --> 09:55.080
While there, she ate
six pomegranates.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.480
People don't want cars

09:56.540 --> 09:59.610
named after
hungry, old Greek broads!

09:59.680 --> 10:00.780
They want names

10:00.850 --> 10:01.950
like Mustang

10:02.010 --> 10:03.110
and Cheetah--

10:03.180 --> 10:05.490
vicious animal names.

10:05.550 --> 10:09.090
The problem with you guys is
you've forgotten your roots!

10:09.150 --> 10:10.480
You? What are your roots?

10:10.560 --> 10:14.530
I guess they extend to when
the Anglos met the Saxons.

10:14.590 --> 10:17.460
In other words,
when white met bread.

10:17.530 --> 10:20.840
Sir, we'd love to know
what your roots are, and
what they have to teach us.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.800
I have no roots.

10:22.870 --> 10:25.070
All I know is that...

10:25.140 --> 10:27.070
I'm just...

10:27.140 --> 10:29.140
a lonely guy.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.340
All:
Oh...

10:30.410 --> 10:32.350
What's he so upset about?

10:32.410 --> 10:33.850
Good Lord.

10:33.910 --> 10:36.720
Marge, this can't be
the right address.

10:40.450 --> 10:42.020
Hello, in there.

10:42.090 --> 10:42.990
Homer?

10:43.050 --> 10:45.220
Herb?

10:45.290 --> 10:47.900
You look just like...
You look just like...

10:47.960 --> 10:49.900
Except you got less...
Except you got more...

10:49.960 --> 10:52.570
And a little more...
And a little less...

10:52.630 --> 10:55.300
God, I feel so..!
God, I feel so..!

10:55.370 --> 10:57.240
Homer!
Herbert!

10:57.300 --> 10:58.640
Oh, Herbert.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.400
Welcome to my home, brother.

11:00.470 --> 11:03.680
Holy moley,
the bastard's rich!

11:03.740 --> 11:06.150
Herb, allow me
to introduce my family.

11:06.210 --> 11:07.850
This is my wife,
Marge.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.140
Hello.
Hello!

11:09.210 --> 11:11.410
You old dog!
She's gorgeous.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.980
Thank you.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.590
And our
three children

11:14.650 --> 11:16.450
Bart, Lisa and Maggie.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.430
Hello, sir.
Hello, Mr. Powell.

11:18.490 --> 11:19.790
All born in wedlock?

11:19.860 --> 11:21.730
Yeah, though the boy
was a close call.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.290
So, Lisa

11:23.360 --> 11:25.300
are you
the little hell-raiser

11:25.360 --> 11:27.120
your father
told me about?

11:27.200 --> 11:28.370
No, sir,
I can assure you,
I'm not.

11:28.430 --> 11:30.630
<i>I'm the little
hell-raiser, sir.</i>

11:30.700 --> 11:32.870
Would you like
to hold the baby, Herb ?

11:32.940 --> 11:34.110
I'm afraid I
wouldn't know how.

11:34.170 --> 11:35.530
Oh, what's to know?

11:35.610 --> 11:36.940
Just dive in. Catch!

11:39.410 --> 11:42.520
God, that
new-baby smell.

11:42.580 --> 11:45.290
Homer, you're the richest man
I know.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.960
I feel the same about you.

11:48.020 --> 11:51.190
While you're here,
I want you to make yourselves
right at home.

11:51.260 --> 11:55.060
Any time you're hungry,
anytime day or night

11:55.130 --> 11:56.260
cook will make you
anything you want.

11:56.330 --> 11:57.000
Even pork chops?

11:57.060 --> 11:58.600
Absolutely.

11:58.660 --> 12:01.990
We have a tennis court,
a swimming pool,
a screening room.

12:02.070 --> 12:04.770
If I want pork chops
even in the middle
of the night

12:04.840 --> 12:06.570
your guy
will fry them up?

12:06.640 --> 12:08.780
Sure. That's what he's paid for.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.740
Now, if you need towels,
laundry...

12:10.810 --> 12:13.710
Wait. Let me see
if I got this straight.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.780
It's Christmas day,
4:00 a.m.

12:15.850 --> 12:17.650
There's a rumble
in my stomach...

12:17.720 --> 12:18.720
Homer, please.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.950
Your old man
sure loves pork chops.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.820
He sure does, Uncle Herb.

12:23.890 --> 12:27.760
Bart, Uncle Herb
sounds so formal.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.200
Do you think
you could call me...

12:29.260 --> 12:30.930
Uncie Herb?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.370
<i>No problemo, Uncie Herb.</i>

12:32.430 --> 12:34.100
He's adorable.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.670
My nephew's adorable.

12:35.730 --> 12:36.890
Marco.

12:36.970 --> 12:38.010
Polo.

12:38.070 --> 12:38.910
Marco!
Polo.

12:38.970 --> 12:41.710
Will you kids
shut up?!

12:41.770 --> 12:44.100
So, Marge, a little
about yourself.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.380
Well, I met Homer
in high school.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.770
We got married

12:47.850 --> 12:49.780
and had three
beautiful children.

12:49.850 --> 12:52.790
Wow, we have so much
catching up to do.

12:52.850 --> 12:56.690
Hmm. Actually, I just told you
pretty much everything.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.660
Watch me dive!
Watch me dive!

12:58.720 --> 13:00.550
Okay, we're watching!

13:00.630 --> 13:02.660
I hope we're not
spoiling them.

13:02.730 --> 13:04.630
Man, you weren't
watching. I
did a double--

13:04.700 --> 13:05.970
You didn't watch me dive.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.180
A millionaire?!

13:16.240 --> 13:17.440
I kept the wrong one.

13:17.510 --> 13:18.980
Look son,

13:19.040 --> 13:20.670
<i>I'll come as soon as I can get
out of here.</i>

13:20.750 --> 13:22.220
In the meantime

13:22.280 --> 13:25.390
<i>please don't do
anything stupid.</i>

13:29.620 --> 13:32.990
Uncie Herb, can I spit
over the side?

13:33.060 --> 13:34.660
I love this kid.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.730
Hock your brains out.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.400
( <i>hocking )</i>

13:38.460 --> 13:39.260
( <i>hocking )</i>

13:39.330 --> 13:40.800
Ho, got him!

13:40.870 --> 13:43.700
Hello Cook, sorry to bother
you so late

13:43.770 --> 13:46.370
but I got
a hankering for some...

13:46.440 --> 13:48.510
That's right!
Don't forget the applesauce.

13:50.510 --> 13:51.280
Okay, Homer.

13:51.340 --> 13:53.000
Pick out any one you want.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.280
Are you sure you want
to give me a car?

13:55.350 --> 13:57.850
You know what these things
cost me?

13:57.920 --> 14:00.790
There's maybe 40 bucks'
worth of steel in them.

14:00.850 --> 14:02.160
Oh, okay.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.060
I'd like a big one then.

14:04.120 --> 14:04.990
We don't have a big one.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.090
Why not?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.700
Because Americans
don't want big cars.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.030
Then give me one
with lots of pep.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.930
Sorry, our cars
don't have pep.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Why not?

14:13.060 --> 14:15.660
Americans want good mileage,
not pep.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.390
Homer,
tell the nice man

14:17.470 --> 14:18.610
<i>what country
you come from.</i>

14:18.670 --> 14:19.770
America.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.440
Do you hear that,
ya morons?!

14:21.510 --> 14:23.310
This is why we're
getting killed in the
marketplace!

14:23.370 --> 14:25.570
Instead of listening
to what people want

14:25.640 --> 14:27.500
you're telling them
what they want.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.850
Homer

14:28.910 --> 14:30.840
I need your help.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.090
You do?

14:32.150 --> 14:35.520
Yeah. I want you
to help me

14:35.590 --> 14:37.590
design a car--

14:37.660 --> 14:40.890
a car for all the Homer Simpsons
out there

14:40.960 --> 14:45.100
and I want to pay you
$200,000 a year!

14:45.160 --> 14:48.230
And I want to let you!

14:48.300 --> 14:49.740
Homer,

14:49.800 --> 14:50.770
meet my team
of engineers

14:50.840 --> 14:53.070
They're gonna
build your car.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.780
Hiya, team.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.840
Now boys and
girls, this project
is our top priority.

14:56.910 --> 14:58.950
Everything else is on hold.

14:59.010 --> 15:00.450
I don't wanna see
anything until it's finished.

15:00.510 --> 15:01.680
All:
But, sir...

15:01.750 --> 15:02.980
Bup-bup-bup-bup.

15:03.050 --> 15:05.990
Direct all your questions
to Mr. Homer Simpson--

15:06.050 --> 15:09.420
the man with the vision.

15:09.490 --> 15:11.990
The man who's going to bust
this company out of its rut.

15:12.060 --> 15:15.700
The man who's going to change
American transportation forever.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.930
So uh, what kind of car
would you like, Mr. Simpson?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.200
I don't know.

15:20.270 --> 15:22.570
Whatever you kids
want to do today

15:22.630 --> 15:23.560
you just tell Uncie Herb.

15:23.640 --> 15:24.810
Oh, dear.

15:24.870 --> 15:26.140
I want to go on a
pony ride, Uncie Herb.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.700
I want to go
on a boat ride,
Uncie Herb.

15:27.770 --> 15:28.600
Pony ride.
Boat ride.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.930
Pony ride.
Boat ride.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.710
( bickering trails off )

15:32.780 --> 15:34.010
Ahoy, mateys,

15:34.080 --> 15:34.950
Yee-ha!

15:36.280 --> 15:38.220
Kids are so easy
to please.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.380
I really hope we're not
spoiling them.

15:40.450 --> 15:41.390
Nah.

15:41.450 --> 15:43.180
What's that?

15:43.250 --> 15:44.980
The on-board computer.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.030
Oh, right.

15:46.090 --> 15:47.490
What's that do-hickey?

15:47.560 --> 15:50.460
Your brother told you
to help us with this car.

15:50.530 --> 15:51.830
Yeah, he did.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.340
Well, then, why don't you
get us some coffee?

15:55.400 --> 15:57.100
Oh, okay.

15:57.170 --> 15:58.340
Batting ninth...

15:58.400 --> 15:59.460
Uncie Herb!

15:59.540 --> 16:02.010
Homer:
Whew.

16:02.070 --> 16:03.030
Oh, boy.

16:03.110 --> 16:03.980
Hey Homer,
how's your car coming?

16:04.040 --> 16:04.750
Oh, fine.

16:04.810 --> 16:06.550
We're putting in

16:06.610 --> 16:09.220
an on-board something or
other, and rack-and-peanut
steering.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.080
Homer.

16:10.150 --> 16:11.650
Huh?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.760
You didn't ask for
rack-and-pinion steering,
did you?

16:14.820 --> 16:15.860
Uh yeah,
I think I did.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.060
How could you
ask for it?

16:17.120 --> 16:18.260
You don't even know
what it is.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.850
You just called it rack and
peanut steering.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.250
May I be excused please?

16:21.330 --> 16:24.500
No. Homer, do you know why
I gave you this job?

16:24.560 --> 16:25.460
Cause you think
I'm a genius?

16:25.530 --> 16:27.000
I don't think you're a genius.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.570
You think
I'm dynamic?

16:28.630 --> 16:30.530
I don't think
you're dynamic.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.940
I work well
with others?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.360
No, no, no.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.380
Homer, I gave you this job
because you're an average schmo!

16:35.440 --> 16:36.610
Oh, great.

16:36.670 --> 16:38.570
All you need is
a little self-confidence.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.070
Uncie Herb, I don't know
anything about cars--

16:40.140 --> 16:41.870
Listen to me.

16:41.950 --> 16:44.850
Here's what you do.
From now on, before
you say anything

16:44.920 --> 16:46.020
say to yourself:

16:46.080 --> 16:47.880
"If I was ever
sure of anything

16:47.950 --> 16:49.280
I'm sure of this."

16:49.350 --> 16:50.050
Do you understand?

16:50.120 --> 16:51.160
Sort of.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.320
Homer?!
What?

16:52.390 --> 16:54.630
Answer me again
with self-confidence.

16:54.690 --> 16:55.390
Sort of!

16:55.460 --> 16:56.930
Now go get 'em!

16:57.000 --> 16:58.700
( <i>battle cry )</i>

16:58.760 --> 17:01.290
All right, you eggheads!
I want a place in this car
to put my drink!

17:01.370 --> 17:03.570
Sir, the car has
a beverage holder.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.170
Hello, hello, Einstein.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.040
I said a place
to put <i>my drink--</i>

17:09.109 --> 17:11.810
You know those super-slakers
they sell in the Quickie Mart?

17:11.880 --> 17:13.510
The cup is this big.

17:13.579 --> 17:14.680
..Extremely large
beverage holder.

17:14.750 --> 17:15.950
I'm not done yet.

17:16.010 --> 17:18.010
You know that little ball
you put on the aerial

17:18.079 --> 17:21.310
so you can find your car
in the parking lot? That
should be on every car.

17:21.390 --> 17:23.160
Little ball...

17:23.220 --> 17:25.690
and some things are
so snazzy they never
go out of style,

17:25.760 --> 17:28.530
like tail fins
and bubble domes,
and shag carpeting.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.650
I've got to call the boss.

17:30.730 --> 17:33.170
Hello?
Uh-huh.

17:33.230 --> 17:34.070
Well you know what?

17:34.130 --> 17:35.940
I'm glad you're nervous,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.700
because that means
we're on the right track.

17:37.770 --> 17:38.740
Uh-huh.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.330
Uh-huh.

17:41.410 --> 17:44.980
All right, all right!
Okay this is what you're
going to do.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.600
You're going to hang up,
call me back

17:46.680 --> 17:50.050
and say the exact opposite
of everything you just said.
Goodbye.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.540
Bart, Lisa,
come over here.

17:51.620 --> 17:52.690
What is it,
Uncie Herb?

17:52.750 --> 17:54.350
I want you to hear

17:54.420 --> 17:55.960
what the guys down
at the plant think
of your old man.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.260
( phone rings )
Hello?

17:57.320 --> 18:00.830
<i>Um, Homer Simpson
is a brilliant man</i>

18:00.890 --> 18:04.530
<i>with lots of well-thought-out,
practical ideas.</i>

18:04.600 --> 18:08.040
<i>He is insuring the financial
security of this company</i>

18:08.100 --> 18:09.470
<i>for years to come.
Oh yes,</i>

18:09.530 --> 18:11.730
<i>and his personal hygiene
is above reproach.</i>

18:11.800 --> 18:13.830
Whoa. Our Dad's the greatest.

18:13.910 --> 18:15.580
I'm impressed.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.610
Way to go, Dad.

18:16.670 --> 18:18.140
Pretty good, eh?

18:18.210 --> 18:20.850
I want a horn here,
here and here.

18:20.910 --> 18:24.450
You can never find your horn
when you're mad

18:24.520 --> 18:25.920
and they should all play
"La Cucaracha."

18:25.980 --> 18:27.340
Can do, Mr. S.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.760
And sometimes the kids
are in the back seat.

18:29.820 --> 18:32.160
They're hollering.
They're making you nuts.

18:32.220 --> 18:33.980
There's gotta be something you
can do about that.

18:34.060 --> 18:36.100
Maybe a built-in video game
would keep them entertained?

18:36.160 --> 18:37.130
You're fired.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.670
What is my brother
paying you for?

18:38.730 --> 18:41.800
What about a separate soundproof
bubble dome for the kids

18:41.870 --> 18:44.440
with optional restraints
and muzzles?

18:44.500 --> 18:45.660
Bull's-eye!

18:45.740 --> 18:47.510
And another thing.
When I gun the motor

18:47.570 --> 18:51.480
I want people to think
the world is coming to an end.
Vroom-vroom-vroom!

18:51.540 --> 18:56.140
Lisa:
The mouse is named Itchy,
and the cat is named Scratchy.

18:56.210 --> 18:57.940
They hate each other.

18:58.020 --> 18:59.250
And they're
not shy about
expressing it.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.250
Oh, good, good.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.260

19:06.420 --> 19:10.690
( <i>Bart and Lisa laughing )</i>

19:13.600 --> 19:17.240
( all laughing )
Whoo-hoo!!

19:17.300 --> 19:18.370
To think I wasted my life

19:18.440 --> 19:20.540
in board rooms
and stockholders meetings

19:20.610 --> 19:23.580
when I could have been
watching cartoons!

19:23.640 --> 19:26.580
This old fool
has wasted his life.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.740
( <i>cat yowling )</i>

19:39.890 --> 19:40.890
Hello there.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.000
Do you miss
the Antarctic?

19:43.060 --> 19:45.170
Now this <i>is
spoiling them.</i>

19:47.930 --> 19:52.100
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

19:59.110 --> 20:00.780
Ladies and gentlemen

20:00.850 --> 20:02.950
esteemed stockholders

20:03.010 --> 20:04.340
members of the press

20:04.420 --> 20:06.220
your holiness..

20:06.280 --> 20:11.780
Tonight, we are going to witness
automotive history.

Homer:
All my life,
I have searched for a car

20:17.160 --> 20:20.670
that feels a certain way--

20:20.730 --> 20:22.570
powerful like a gorilla

20:22.630 --> 20:25.960
yet soft and yielding
like a Nerf ball.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.780
Now, at last, I have found it.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.710
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen

20:30.780 --> 20:34.150
presenting the car designed
for the average man..

20:34.210 --> 20:35.380
The Homer.

20:37.420 --> 20:38.350
( <i>gagging )</i>

20:41.490 --> 20:42.660
Any questions?

20:42.720 --> 20:44.490
What does this monstrosity cost?

20:44.560 --> 20:47.260
Jerry, what's
the sticker price?

20:48.530 --> 20:50.800
$82,000?!

20:50.860 --> 20:56.400
This monstrosity
cost $82,000?!

20:56.470 --> 20:58.340
What have I done?

20:58.400 --> 21:01.670
I mean, the zoo was fun, but...

21:01.740 --> 21:03.510
I'm ruined.

21:03.570 --> 21:05.970
( <i>Herb sobbing )</i>

21:09.180 --> 21:10.880
both:
Bye, Uncie Herb.

21:10.950 --> 21:12.520
Good-bye, Herb.

21:12.580 --> 21:15.310
Gee Herb,
because of me,
you lost your business

21:15.390 --> 21:17.790
your home
and all your possessions.

21:17.860 --> 21:22.000
I can't help but think
that maybe you would
have been better off

21:22.060 --> 21:23.200
if I'd never come
into your life.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.230
<i>Maybe I would have been
better off?</i>

21:25.300 --> 21:26.200
<i>Maybe?</i>

21:26.260 --> 21:27.560
Why, you spongehead.

21:27.630 --> 21:30.500
Of course I'd have been
better off!

21:30.570 --> 21:34.980
As far as I'm concerned,
I have no brother.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.410
Maybe he just said that
to make conversation.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.650
His life was
an unbridled success

21:40.710 --> 21:43.480
until he found out
he was a Simpson.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.960
I'm here.
Now where's that millionaire
chip off the old block

21:49.020 --> 21:50.560
I call sonny boy?

21:50.620 --> 21:52.090
Get in, Dad.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.330
I'll explain on the way home.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.460
D-ohh, I knew
you'd blow it.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.300
Dad?

22:00.360 --> 22:01.590
What is it, boy?

22:01.670 --> 22:04.000
I thought your car
was really cool.

22:04.070 --> 22:05.310
Thanks, boy.

22:05.370 --> 22:07.870
I was waiting for
someone to say that.
