I'm just surprised
they're taking this so hard.

02:37.398 --> 02:38.599
I mean, don't
get me wrong-

02:38.650 --> 02:39.633
I will always love Whitney, too,

02:39.684 --> 02:41.285
but you'd think,

02:41.352 --> 02:42.953
after two months,
they'd let it go.

02:43.021 --> 02:44.071
I got this.

02:51.446 --> 02:53.363
Is this you?
Mm-hmm.

02:53.448 --> 02:56.767
August 31, 1997.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.818
I was about to start
my senior year of high school

02:58.870 --> 03:00.153
when tragedy struck.

03:00.204 --> 03:01.672
I spent the next
eight months

03:01.756 --> 03:03.340
writing condolence letters
to the two princes

03:03.424 --> 03:05.842
and listening to "Candle
in the Wind" on constant repeat.

03:05.927 --> 03:08.045
Emma, I had no idea you had
such a connection to her.

03:08.129 --> 03:09.263
I didn't.

03:09.330 --> 03:11.765
I mean, every little girl
worshiped her,

03:11.832 --> 03:15.519
but she was just a physical
representation of my pain.

03:15.603 --> 03:17.354
You know, I was scared.

03:17.438 --> 03:18.889
It was my last year
of high school.

03:18.973 --> 03:20.607
No more living at home.

03:20.675 --> 03:22.976
I was saying good-bye
to my teachers and my friend.

03:23.027 --> 03:26.780
Diana dying represented
the loss of my childhood.

03:26.847 --> 03:28.482
So Whitney is their Diana.

03:28.533 --> 03:29.516
Yeah, exactly.

03:30.852 --> 03:32.152
<i>It was written for Diana Ross.</i>

03:32.203 --> 03:33.954
No, Mercedes,
you are wrong, okay?

03:34.021 --> 03:36.022
<i>The Bodyguard was originally
written for Barbra Streisand.</i>

03:36.074 --> 03:38.325
Actually, Rachel, it was
supposed to be Diana Ross-

03:38.376 --> 03:40.160
and Steve McQueen,
back in the '70s.

03:40.211 --> 03:42.028
Thank you, Mr. Shue.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.380
I've been doing some research

03:43.464 --> 03:45.582
to prepare
for this week's lesson.

03:45.667 --> 03:46.967
Oh, my God, yes.

03:47.034 --> 03:48.702
It's about time we did
a Whitney tribute!

03:48.753 --> 03:49.753
Are we sure
that's appropriate?

03:49.837 --> 03:51.004
You did not just ask that.

03:51.055 --> 03:52.205
I just mean,
didn't Whitney

03:52.256 --> 03:53.724
kind of have
a lot of problems?

03:53.808 --> 03:56.059
She had a hard life, Sam. And?

03:56.144 --> 03:58.178
Look, this week isn't about
passing judgment on Whitney.

03:58.229 --> 03:59.980
It's about celebrating
her legacy,

04:00.047 --> 04:01.982
honoring her memory,
her accomplishments.

04:02.049 --> 04:03.066
Which I will happily list
for you.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.017
But I also
want you guys

04:04.068 --> 04:05.268
to use her songs

04:05.353 --> 04:07.053
to get underneath
your own feelings.

04:07.105 --> 04:11.325
To express and explore
what's really going on with you.

04:11.392 --> 04:12.442
I don't get it, Mr. Shue.

04:12.527 --> 04:14.227
What's really going on with us?

04:14.278 --> 04:16.363
Well, for most of you,
these next few weeks

04:16.414 --> 04:17.863
will be your last
here at McKinley.

04:17.915 --> 04:20.951
Lots of changes
coming up, lots of...

04:21.035 --> 04:22.369
saying good-bye.

04:22.420 --> 04:23.903
To your friends,

04:23.955 --> 04:25.622
to your
significant others,

04:25.707 --> 04:28.074
to the last four years
of your life.

04:28.126 --> 04:30.761
For a young person,
all that transition

04:30.845 --> 04:32.879
can be overwhelming.

04:32.930 --> 04:35.632
So it's easier to focus
on other things.

04:35.717 --> 04:38.585
Like not being able to say
good-bye to Whitney Houston.

04:38.636 --> 04:39.853
What are you talking about?

04:39.920 --> 04:40.971
Santana, it's okay.

04:41.055 --> 04:42.272
I get it.

04:42.340 --> 04:43.306
You're hanging
on to Whitney

04:43.391 --> 04:44.908
because it's difficult to handle

04:44.976 --> 04:46.610
the upheaval in your own lives.

04:46.694 --> 04:48.428
We're hanging on to Whitney
because she was incredible

04:48.479 --> 04:50.280
and we love her, so don't
put your baggage on us.

04:50.365 --> 04:52.098
You guys, Mr. Shue's
attempt to understand us,

04:52.150 --> 04:53.867
though misguided,
doesn't matter.

04:53.934 --> 04:55.902
What matters is that I start
rehearsing Whitney's version

04:55.953 --> 04:57.270
of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
immediately.

04:57.321 --> 04:59.373
It is the Mount Everest
of anthems.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.774
How thrilled am I

05:00.825 --> 05:02.275
for this week's assignment?

05:02.326 --> 05:04.161
I'm going to Between the Sheets
to find music.

05:04.245 --> 05:06.663
I got to figure out
what song I want to do.

05:06.748 --> 05:08.415
I could do
"So Emotional,"

05:08.466 --> 05:10.133
which was obviously
written for me,

05:10.218 --> 05:12.002
or "One Moment in Time,"

05:12.086 --> 05:15.005
which was also obviously
written for me.

05:15.089 --> 05:17.057
Well, you can't
really go wrong.

05:17.124 --> 05:19.176
I figured I could kill two birds
with one stone.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.094
I could do one
for the assignment this week,

05:21.145 --> 05:22.562
and then one
for my NYADA audition.

05:22.630 --> 05:24.231
You'll come
with me, right?

05:24.298 --> 05:25.298
Well, I can't today.

05:27.802 --> 05:29.603
Okay. Boo.

05:29.654 --> 05:31.571
Well, just text me
when you're done.

05:33.357 --> 05:34.641
Will do.

05:40.581 --> 05:42.165
Excuse me.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.500
I'm so sorry
to bother you,

05:43.584 --> 05:44.951
but that
hippopotamus head brooch

05:45.002 --> 05:46.453
is awesome.

05:46.504 --> 05:48.154
Thanks. That whole outfit is amazing.

05:48.206 --> 05:50.424
You must get compliments
all the time.

05:50.491 --> 05:51.708
I don't, actually.

05:51.793 --> 05:52.926
Kurt Hummel.

05:52.993 --> 05:54.678
Chandler Kiehl.
I go to North Lima High.

05:54.762 --> 05:57.431
I've got an audition next week,
and I'm dying to do

05:57.498 --> 05:59.132
Rainbow High" from Evita,
but the guy

05:59.183 --> 06:00.767
just said
they're sold out,

06:00.835 --> 06:02.335
which is a preposterous lie.

06:02.386 --> 06:04.104
What are you auditioning for?

06:04.171 --> 06:05.939
Uh, the musical theater
program at NYU.

06:06.006 --> 06:07.958
That's so funny.
I'm auditioning for NYADA.

06:08.025 --> 06:09.526
My callback's in a couple
weeks. NYADA callback?

06:09.610 --> 06:10.894
Ooh-la-la!
What song are you doing?

06:10.978 --> 06:12.312
I'm not sure.

06:12.363 --> 06:15.315
Um, I have to find the perfect
Whitney Houston song.

06:15.366 --> 06:18.368
Oh, my God! You must do
"One Moment in Time. "

06:18.453 --> 06:20.737
Whitney's performance
at the '89 Grammys was legend,

06:20.822 --> 06:22.789
and no one has done
that song justice since.

06:22.857 --> 06:24.791
But then again, there's also
"All the Man That I Need. "

06:24.859 --> 06:26.209
Oh, my God!
That song is amazing!

06:26.294 --> 06:27.527
You-you must do it.

06:27.578 --> 06:29.412
Finally, a love song
where it didn't have to hurt

06:29.497 --> 06:30.964
to turn out right.

06:31.031 --> 06:32.666
Sorry. Am I being really loud?

06:32.717 --> 06:35.218
When I get excited,
I tend to start yelling.

06:35.303 --> 06:37.337
No, no. You're just
really enthusiastic.

06:37.388 --> 06:38.672
It's refreshing.

06:38.723 --> 06:39.973
Infectious, actually.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.558
Then I should quit
while I'm ahead.

06:41.642 --> 06:42.976
Nice to meet you,
Kurt Hummel.

06:43.043 --> 06:45.562
I'm sure you'll nail
whatever song you pick.

06:45.646 --> 06:46.813
Thank you.
Oh, and good luck

06:46.881 --> 06:47.881
with your NYADA callback.

06:47.932 --> 06:49.883
Let me know if I can be
of any help.

06:49.934 --> 06:52.051
We future New Yorkers
got to stick together.

still cool dancers.

09:14.211 --> 09:15.962

dancing in my dreams.

09:16.030 --> 09:18.331
And you can fly

Quinn... you okay?

09:25.003 --> 09:27.004
You looked kind of bummed
out back there.

09:27.055 --> 09:29.039
I'm fine.

09:29.091 --> 09:30.925
How's your physical
therapy going?

09:32.144 --> 09:33.261
I keep going,

09:33.345 --> 09:34.679
and nothing seems
to be happening,

09:34.730 --> 09:35.897
so it's pretty depressing.

09:38.150 --> 09:39.984
Well, what if I went
with you next time?

09:40.051 --> 09:41.652
That would definitely
be less depressing.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.053
You really don't have
to go with me.

09:43.105 --> 09:43.938
I want to.

09:45.774 --> 09:47.692
You want to come with me? Why?

09:47.743 --> 09:49.560
I care about you.

09:49.611 --> 09:51.829
And, to me, being a
Christian isn't about talk.

09:51.897 --> 09:53.197
It's about actions.

09:54.399 --> 09:55.917
Come on.

09:56.001 --> 09:58.202
I'll let you hold one
of my dreads for luck.

10:04.176 --> 10:07.044
I've got a little surprise
for you.

10:07.095 --> 10:09.297
Okay, if this is another
Rihanna song in the pool,

10:09.381 --> 10:10.681
I have to take
pictures this time.

10:10.749 --> 10:11.883
I...

10:13.135 --> 10:15.136
Mademoiselle Pillsbury?
Mm-hmm.

10:20.142 --> 10:21.726
What is this?

10:21.777 --> 10:26.147
"I Do's Done Right Wedding
Planning by Mr. Lavender. "

10:26.231 --> 10:28.366
Mr. Lavender.

10:28.433 --> 10:30.902
Northwestern Ohio's
premier wedding planner.

10:30.953 --> 10:32.286
I booked him for us.

10:32.371 --> 10:34.605
I'm getting
a pretty decent tax refund.

10:34.656 --> 10:36.908
And I sold some blood platelets.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.826
This is absolutely
wonderful,

10:38.911 --> 10:41.612
but, um, I'm not so
sure that we need him.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.130
You know, I mean, since
we're having the wedding

10:43.215 --> 10:44.281
at Christmas,
the-the church

10:44.333 --> 10:45.550
is already going
to be decorated.

10:45.617 --> 10:47.051
I was going to put the
champagne fountain

10:47.118 --> 10:48.419
near the manger,
the cake near the...

10:48.470 --> 10:50.171
I want to move the wedding up-
to May.

10:50.255 --> 10:52.640
May- that's...
that's next month.

10:52.724 --> 10:53.925
Uh-huh.

10:53.976 --> 10:55.893
Is this about S-E-X?

10:55.961 --> 10:57.511
This is about us.

10:57.596 --> 10:59.931
Emma, we've been in love
for almost three years.

10:59.982 --> 11:01.899
There's no reason we should
wait seven more months.

11:01.967 --> 11:04.485
Except for the fact that wedding
planning takes so much time.

11:04.570 --> 11:05.686
It takes so
much time.

11:05.771 --> 11:07.271
I mean, I just started
decorating our

11:07.322 --> 11:08.823
personalized nut cups, and I'm
only on the fifth one and...

11:12.611 --> 11:15.196
I guess we can let Mr.
Lavender worry about the...

11:16.415 --> 11:18.165
Okay.

11:18.250 --> 11:19.450
Okay?
All right.

11:19.501 --> 11:20.451
Okay?
Okay.

11:22.087 --> 11:23.921
Oh, my God, I've been practicing
Whitney Houston's version

11:23.989 --> 11:25.289
of "The Star Spangled
Banner" all night,

11:25.340 --> 11:26.290
and I still
can't sing it.

11:26.341 --> 11:27.341
You're just
realizing this now?

11:27.426 --> 11:29.343
I'm surprised
anyone's attempted it

11:29.428 --> 11:31.045
after she nailed it
to the wall.

11:32.347 --> 11:34.465
Oh, I know
what that is.

11:34.516 --> 11:36.968
Finn sends me cutsie text
messages all the time.

11:37.019 --> 11:38.269
Usually, they're
puns about my boobs,

11:38.336 --> 11:39.503
but I still
appreciate the effort.

11:39.554 --> 11:40.972
It's not from Blaine.

11:41.023 --> 11:42.974
Th-Then who is it?

11:43.025 --> 11:44.341
He's just a guy.

11:44.393 --> 11:46.560
I met him at Between the Sheets. Oh.

11:46.645 --> 11:47.678
His name is Chandler.

11:47.729 --> 11:49.063
He's-he's nice.

11:49.147 --> 11:50.781
And what did Mr. Between
the Sheets say then?

11:50.849 --> 11:52.683
Nothing.

11:52.734 --> 11:54.201
We just joke around.

11:54.286 --> 11:55.903
It's sweet.
Mm-hmm.

11:55.988 --> 11:58.456
Okay, all right.
Um...

11:58.523 --> 11:59.573
"Are you an astronaut?

11:59.658 --> 12:01.242
Because your smile
is out of this world. "

12:01.326 --> 12:02.326
Oh! Are you
kidding me?

12:04.362 --> 12:07.031
Kurt, you have been going at
this with him for two days now?

12:07.082 --> 12:08.299
It's nothing.

12:08.366 --> 12:09.867
It's-it's just fun.
He makes me feel good.

12:09.918 --> 12:12.003
Blaine is supposed to
make you feel good.

12:14.222 --> 12:16.924
You said that Finn sends you
cute text messages every day?

12:17.009 --> 12:18.542
Does he compliment you?

12:18.593 --> 12:20.210
Constantly trying
to get in your pants?

12:20.262 --> 12:21.512
Yeah, he's an
18-year-old boy.

12:25.233 --> 12:27.384
Have you ever heard of
lesbian bed death?

12:27.436 --> 12:29.219
No.
I read about it online.

12:29.271 --> 12:30.738
It's when two lesbians
date for long enough,

12:30.822 --> 12:32.606
they become like sisters.
Oh.

12:32.691 --> 12:34.725
And Blaine and I are like
an old married couple-

12:34.776 --> 12:35.993
a fabulous old married couple,

12:36.061 --> 12:37.611
like Paul Newman
and Joanne Woodward.

12:37.696 --> 12:39.530
But I don't think
we've had an unscheduled

12:39.581 --> 12:40.915
make-out session in,
like, a month.

12:40.999 --> 12:42.867
You schedule
make-out sessions?

12:42.918 --> 12:46.754
The point is: I love Blaine
and-and Blaine loves me,

12:46.838 --> 12:48.238
but he doesn't exactly
make me blush

12:48.290 --> 12:49.406
with his texts right now.

12:49.458 --> 12:50.624
W- What's the harm of someone

12:50.709 --> 12:52.376
making me feel special
if it's all innocent?

12:52.427 --> 12:53.844
Okay.

12:53.912 --> 12:55.629
Would you show Blaine
those text messages?

12:55.714 --> 12:57.414
Of course not.
Oh, well, then I guess

12:57.466 --> 12:58.549
it's not that innocent.

13:04.056 --> 13:05.589
Hey, some great Whitney songs
so far

13:05.640 --> 13:07.608
this week, guys.
I'm really proud of the way

13:07.693 --> 13:09.310
you guys have been
conjuring up the emotions

13:09.394 --> 13:12.396
you feel towards her as we begin
to move on and say good-bye.

13:12.447 --> 13:13.731
Mr. Shue, I've been
going with Quinn

13:13.782 --> 13:15.265
to her rehab
this week.

13:15.317 --> 13:16.534
We started working
on a Whitney song together

13:16.601 --> 13:17.618
that we'd like to share.

13:17.703 --> 13:19.153
Not sure how
it's gonna help

13:19.237 --> 13:21.655
anyone say good-bye, but it's
a song we both really dig.

Quinn, when you sang

17:55.420 --> 17:57.004
"Saving All My Love For You"

17:57.088 --> 17:59.590
with Joe yesterday,
it sure felt like you meant it.

17:59.641 --> 18:02.309
You guys seemed like a lot more
than just singing partners.

18:02.394 --> 18:03.961
I don't know, Joe's
really pretty,

18:04.012 --> 18:05.813
but I heard she doesn't
shave her armpits.

18:05.897 --> 18:07.297
Joe and I are
just friends.

18:07.349 --> 18:08.465
Nothing else is
gonna happen.

18:08.517 --> 18:10.017
But you want it to,
don't you?

18:10.101 --> 18:11.802
Doesn't matter
what I want.

18:11.853 --> 18:14.772
I've said good-bye to
that part of my life.

18:14.823 --> 18:17.024
Joe took me to rehab
the other day, we had a moment,

18:17.108 --> 18:18.659
and before we kissed,
he pulled away.

18:18.743 --> 18:20.528
Grossed out by me and my chair.

18:20.612 --> 18:21.862
Quinn, I'm-I'm so sorry.

18:21.947 --> 18:23.163
I don't want to hear that tone.

18:23.248 --> 18:24.081
Joe's not into me.

18:25.450 --> 18:27.501
I don't blame him.

18:27.586 --> 18:29.537
Who would be?

18:29.621 --> 18:30.788
Tsk.

18:33.842 --> 18:35.676
Oh, hey.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.710
Will, honey.

18:36.795 --> 18:38.345
Um, Will, this is...

18:38.430 --> 18:39.713
Mr. La-vender,
the wedding planner.

18:39.798 --> 18:40.514
It's La-ven-der.

18:40.599 --> 18:41.265
Richard Lavender.

18:41.332 --> 18:43.100
It's a family name.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.969
Oh. Wow.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.637
You are not
what I was expecting.

18:46.688 --> 18:48.556
Look, we are having
such exciting ideas.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.173
Citrus and Wasabi
are your colors.

18:50.225 --> 18:51.225
Wasabi is the
new sea foam.

18:51.309 --> 18:52.776
Nice. I...
Right.

18:52.844 --> 18:53.978
And did you know that we can
get these little handy wipes

18:54.029 --> 18:55.345
with our names embossed
on the wrappers?

18:55.397 --> 18:57.231
This sounds great.
Couple things.

18:57.315 --> 18:58.732
At the reception,
I will be rapping.

18:58.817 --> 19:00.401
And we're gonna need
a pretty big stage,

19:00.485 --> 19:01.952
'cause the Glee kids
are gonna perform, too.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.787
I've checked all the available
venues for your dates,

19:03.855 --> 19:05.906
and none of them will
accommodate a stage.

19:05.991 --> 19:07.291
Well, let's keep looking.

19:07.359 --> 19:09.376
Okay, sweetie,
look, I know that

19:09.461 --> 19:11.361
you really want to have
this wedding soon,

19:11.413 --> 19:13.363
I just can't imagine how
we're gonna get all this

19:13.415 --> 19:15.132
done in time.

19:15.199 --> 19:16.967
Mr. Lavender has
recommended that

19:17.035 --> 19:18.702
maybe we look at dates
in September or October.

19:18.753 --> 19:20.170
We're not moving the date.
Okay.

19:20.221 --> 19:21.589
I'm a wedding planner,
not a miracle worker.

19:21.673 --> 19:22.890
I need more time.

19:22.974 --> 19:24.091
You know what? Forget it.

19:24.175 --> 19:24.875
Will, okay, wait...

19:24.926 --> 19:26.010
We can do this ourselves.

19:26.061 --> 19:27.978
We are getting married in May,

19:28.046 --> 19:28.979
just like we agreed.

19:29.047 --> 19:30.931
Thank you for your time.

19:38.023 --> 19:40.774
You want to lift?

19:40.859 --> 19:42.409
Actually wanted to talk to you
about Quinn.

19:42.494 --> 19:43.410
You dig her.

19:43.495 --> 19:44.828
Yeah, I can tell.

19:44.896 --> 19:45.663
Everyone can.

19:46.531 --> 19:47.898
I think she's into you, too.

19:47.949 --> 19:48.782
Seriously?

19:48.867 --> 19:49.900
How do you know?

19:49.951 --> 19:51.669
I used to date her.

19:51.736 --> 19:53.754
So, when you dated her,

19:53.838 --> 19:57.091
how did you handle
your... feelings?

19:57.175 --> 20:00.044
Here's the thing about me:
I can be super helpful,

20:00.095 --> 20:02.296
but when you ask me stuff,
you have to be real specific.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.431
When I was with Quinn
at her rehab,

20:04.516 --> 20:07.434
I was having...

20:07.519 --> 20:08.852
feelings.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.104
You mean like "in
your pants" feelings?

20:12.357 --> 20:13.557
I've been homeschooled
my whole life.

20:13.608 --> 20:15.092
It was a lot easier
to resist temptation

20:15.143 --> 20:17.144
when there were
no girls around.

20:17.228 --> 20:19.897
Yeah, I gave up on that.
I had sex last year.

20:19.948 --> 20:22.149
I mean, I was working
in a strip club, so...

20:22.233 --> 20:24.201
But it's a sin. We're supposed
to wait until we're married.

20:24.268 --> 20:26.286
And we're not supposed to
get tattoos- Leviticus.

20:26.371 --> 20:28.656
Look, when the Bible was
written, things were easier.

20:28.740 --> 20:30.107
I mean, there
was no Internet,

20:30.158 --> 20:31.825
chicks didn't wear short
skirts or anything.

20:31.910 --> 20:33.494
I'm a good Christian,
but there's just

20:33.578 --> 20:35.579
no way a dude's gonna
be able to resist.

20:35.630 --> 20:38.382
I say, let's be a new kind
of Christian, one that

20:38.449 --> 20:40.801
prays and does right by
people but understands

20:40.885 --> 20:43.387
that some of those rules
are kind of old school.

20:43.454 --> 20:44.755
The sex rule makes sense.

20:44.806 --> 20:46.289
It's about
respecting your body,

20:46.341 --> 20:48.125
putting the spiritual
over the physical

20:48.176 --> 20:50.460
so you can feel
closer to God.

20:50.512 --> 20:51.478
Okay.

20:51.563 --> 20:53.847
All I know is

20:53.932 --> 20:55.899
Quinn's a great girl, but
you're gonna have to decide

20:55.967 --> 20:58.468
if you want to get closer to God
or get closer to her.

21:03.808 --> 21:05.859
Hey, I got the cheese plate.

21:05.944 --> 21:08.946
<i>Our Being Bobby Brown marathon
can officially begin.</i>

21:08.997 --> 21:11.314
Who's Chandler?

21:11.366 --> 21:13.316
Why are you going
through my phone?

21:13.368 --> 21:15.419
I'm not going
through your phone.

21:15.486 --> 21:17.371
It's just that
it keeps buzzing

21:17.455 --> 21:20.574
because Chandler won't
stop texting you.

21:20.642 --> 21:23.293
"When we go to New York,
let's go to the front

21:23.344 --> 21:25.929
<i>of the Plaza and reenact
the end of The Way We Were. "</i>

21:25.997 --> 21:28.015
Give me that. "Can you
sing into my voicemail?

21:28.099 --> 21:29.967
I want to make your
voice my ringtone. "

21:30.018 --> 21:31.552
Give me my phone.

21:31.636 --> 21:34.388
There are literally dozens of
texts between the two of you.

21:34.472 --> 21:35.505
Do you know how many times

21:35.557 --> 21:36.840
you've texted me
in the past two days?

21:36.891 --> 21:38.842
Four.

21:38.893 --> 21:41.645
And three of them
were about finding

21:41.696 --> 21:42.696
peach-colored shoe polish.

21:42.781 --> 21:43.781
Why are you
getting so upset?

21:43.848 --> 21:45.649
This is, this is all innocent.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.785
This is cheating, Kurt.

21:47.852 --> 21:49.820
This is texting.

21:49.871 --> 21:51.155
Okay, he is
just a guy

21:51.206 --> 21:52.623
that I met at the music store.

21:52.690 --> 21:53.824
Nothing happened.

21:53.892 --> 21:55.492
You used to text
Sebastian all the time.

21:55.543 --> 21:56.710
You would call
him, even.

21:56.795 --> 21:58.195
But I didn't like him,

21:58.246 --> 22:00.164
and all of those texts
were family friendly.

22:01.382 --> 22:03.383
You like this guy.

22:06.204 --> 22:07.838
I like the way
he makes me feel.

22:07.889 --> 22:09.673
I mean, when was
the last time

22:09.724 --> 22:13.227
that you complimented me
or told me how special I was?

22:13.311 --> 22:15.596
I transferred schools
to be with you!

22:15.680 --> 22:18.348
I, I changed
my whole life!

22:18.399 --> 22:20.601
That doesn't
make you feel loved?

22:20.685 --> 22:23.353
You don't know what it's like
being your boyfriend, okay?

22:23.404 --> 22:26.190
You are the alpha gay!

22:26.241 --> 22:27.691
Even Rachel wanted
to make out with you.

22:27.742 --> 22:29.409
I used to get solos

22:29.494 --> 22:30.393
every week.

22:30.445 --> 22:32.029
And do you know how many times

22:32.080 --> 22:34.248
I've had to sit on a stool
and watch you perform?

22:34.332 --> 22:36.033
Then talk to me.

22:36.084 --> 22:37.367
Tell me that you're unhappy,

22:37.418 --> 22:39.736
but don't cheat on me.

22:39.788 --> 22:41.404
I feel like I have
taken crazy pills!

22:41.456 --> 22:43.207
I didn't cheat on you!

22:43.258 --> 22:47.127
I'm, I'm really sorry
if this made you upset,

22:47.212 --> 22:50.430
but it's, it's, it's okay.

22:52.433 --> 22:53.967
It's not right...

22:55.487 --> 22:57.337
but it's okay.

23:01.292 --> 23:04.511
This song is for anyone
that's ever been cheated on.

23:04.596 --> 23:07.047
This is insane.
I didn't cheat on you!

23:07.132 --> 23:09.933

25:29.151 --> 25:32.604
Hi.

25:32.655 --> 25:34.522
You know, you can learn a lot
about a person

25:34.607 --> 25:35.607
by looking into their locker.

25:35.658 --> 25:37.025
Are you, like, stalking me?

25:37.109 --> 25:38.693
You know we blew it, right?

25:38.778 --> 25:41.112
We wasted three years going
at each other's throats

25:41.163 --> 25:43.031
when we could have
been singing together,

25:43.115 --> 25:44.282
killing it in Glee Club.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.818
We hated each other.
Actually, I hated you.

25:48.337 --> 25:50.822
Sorry. Yes, our duet in Glee
was a whole truckload

25:50.873 --> 25:52.874
of awesome. And who cares
that it took three years?

25:52.959 --> 25:55.760
I mean, we still have plenty
of time to do it again.

25:55.828 --> 25:58.463
We have 42 days ft
until graduation.

25:58.514 --> 26:00.599
Half of that's gonna be
prepping for Nationals.

26:00.666 --> 26:01.683
That was it.

26:01.767 --> 26:02.968
Oh, crap. I think

26:03.019 --> 26:04.853
I just realized
gonna miss you.

26:04.937 --> 26:06.888
Oh, God, say something
irritating so I can get

26:06.973 --> 26:08.523
the taste of this out
of my head, please.

26:08.608 --> 26:10.692
It's okay. Look...

26:10.776 --> 26:14.646
you went out of your way to make my
life a living hell for three years,

26:14.697 --> 26:16.481
but at the end
of the day, I know

26:16.532 --> 26:18.366
that you respect
my talent and my ambition.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.118
I like it when
you sing, and hey,

26:20.185 --> 26:22.370
you're the only other person
at this school besides me

26:22.455 --> 26:23.872
who's willing to kill
their best friend

26:23.956 --> 26:25.907
to get to the top.
Yeah.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.376
Will you do me a favor?

26:28.461 --> 26:30.295
Will you put this up
in your locker?

26:30.362 --> 26:32.864
You want me to put up a picture
of you in my locker?

26:32.915 --> 26:34.666
Okay, we may not be able
to sing together,

26:34.717 --> 26:37.969
but we have 42 days left
to at least be friends.

26:38.037 --> 26:40.705
I'm gonna give you a hug.
It'll be quick.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.092
I'll see you in Glee Club.

26:50.683 --> 26:53.068
Hey, what's up?

26:53.152 --> 26:54.736
What's with all
the stickers?

26:54.820 --> 26:57.489
I'm triaging all my things
for my departure to New York.

26:57.556 --> 27:00.191
Pink is for stay,
blue is for go,

27:00.242 --> 27:01.726
red is for trash

27:01.777 --> 27:04.496
and green is for humidity-
controlled storage to keep in

27:04.563 --> 27:05.697
mint condition
to sell as

27:05.748 --> 27:07.248
memorabilia after I get famous.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.503
Well, what if I want to keep
some of this stuff?

27:11.570 --> 27:13.404
You can go through
my leftovers.

27:13.456 --> 27:15.457
You're not taking this with you?

27:15.541 --> 27:18.626
Blaine and I are on the rocks.

27:18.711 --> 27:20.962
I honestly don't know
what's up with him.

27:21.047 --> 27:22.931
But with that said,
I do reserve

27:23.015 --> 27:24.382
the right to
re-Post-it later.

27:24.433 --> 27:26.751
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
This isn't garbage.

27:26.802 --> 27:30.388
Dad, it's a certificate
of participation for Regionals.

27:30.439 --> 27:31.756
The one that we lost.

27:31.807 --> 27:33.925
Come on. We have to be heartless
about this stuff.

27:33.976 --> 27:35.593
<i>You've seen Hoarders.
This is how it starts.</i>

27:35.644 --> 27:37.479
I'd like to keep it.

27:37.563 --> 27:39.030
Dad, don't be
sentimental on me.

27:39.098 --> 27:40.398
Well, no, screw that.

27:40.449 --> 27:41.766
We haven't been getting
sentimental enough, okay?

27:41.817 --> 27:44.869
The both of us, we've been way
too casual about this.

27:44.937 --> 27:46.287
Do you realize that
we haven't had

27:46.372 --> 27:47.706
our Friday night dinner
for three weeks?

27:47.773 --> 27:49.040
You've been in D.C.

27:49.108 --> 27:50.875
You think I couldn't get
an earlier flight?

27:50.943 --> 27:53.444
Most of the other congressman
are gone on Thursday night.

27:53.496 --> 27:55.279
Okay, I don't get it. So why
have you been skipping dinner?

27:55.331 --> 27:56.781
Because I don't want you to go!

28:02.955 --> 28:04.723
You know, you and me,

28:04.790 --> 28:07.392
we've been doing this dance
for over a decade.

28:07.459 --> 28:09.427
You know, Starsky and gay Hutch.

28:10.813 --> 28:12.731
Everybody warned me
that when you were eight,

28:12.798 --> 28:15.350
and you were bugging
the crap out of me that

28:15.434 --> 28:18.653
one day I'd be begging for you
to wake me up at 4:00 a. m.

28:18.738 --> 28:21.322
with a nightmare
or, you know,

28:21.407 --> 28:23.641
wreck the kitchen,
playing restaurant.

28:23.692 --> 28:24.976
I was nine.

28:25.027 --> 28:26.811
Who knew paella was
gonna be so complicated?

28:28.998 --> 28:31.649
So you've been skipping dinners
because you're sad

28:31.700 --> 28:34.169
there's not gonna be any more
dinners? I'm confused.

28:34.253 --> 28:37.422
Ah, you don't get it yet.

28:37.489 --> 28:38.339
You know,

28:38.424 --> 28:40.258
I know you got a taste of it

28:40.325 --> 28:41.793
when you lost your mom,

28:41.844 --> 28:44.129
but it's just like the older
you get, you just see.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.930
It's just, none of it lasts.

28:45.998 --> 28:47.715
Yes, you and I will

28:47.800 --> 28:49.350
always love each other,

28:49.435 --> 28:51.386
and you and I will always
be there for each other,

28:51.470 --> 28:54.105
but, you know, as soon
as you walk out our door

28:54.173 --> 28:55.273
towards New York,

28:55.340 --> 28:57.208
everything's
gonna change.

28:57.276 --> 29:00.178
And it won't change back.

29:00.246 --> 29:02.180
Not to the way it is now.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.452
Listen, I am so happy for you.

29:07.519 --> 29:09.454
Kurt, really,

29:09.521 --> 29:12.523
I am so happy
and I am so proud.

29:12.575 --> 29:16.194
You know, you and me, we, uh,
we made each other men.

29:16.245 --> 29:17.962
Yeah.

29:18.030 --> 29:22.066
Just sometimes I just, I want
my sweet little boy back.

29:27.372 --> 29:29.374
I'm gonna miss you, Kurt.

29:30.593 --> 29:33.044
A lot.

29:33.095 --> 29:34.762
I'm gonna to miss you, too, Dad.

Okay, bros, here you go.
I was inspired

32:25.720 --> 32:27.220
by the goodie bags
they give out

32:27.272 --> 32:28.405
at the end of
birthday parties.

32:28.490 --> 32:29.823
Thought I'd try it.

32:29.891 --> 32:31.558
A little something from
the Puckster to all of you.

32:31.609 --> 32:34.028
Sorry, Finn, I tried to
get your balls back from Rachel,

32:34.079 --> 32:35.412
but she's got those on lockdown.

32:35.497 --> 32:38.332
Guitar pick. Sweet.

32:38.399 --> 32:41.735
And a shot glass that says
"Dinosaurs on Ice. "

32:41.786 --> 32:43.837
Why does mine say,
"Drink till she's cute"?

32:43.905 --> 32:45.873
Had the picks inscribed with
"The Dudes of Glee 2012".

32:45.924 --> 32:48.792
Shot glasses all say different
things 'cause I jacked them

32:48.877 --> 32:50.461
from houses
I clean pools at.

32:50.545 --> 32:52.412
Thanks, man.
What's this for?

32:52.464 --> 32:54.348
The clock's ticking,
the time's coming

32:54.415 --> 32:56.100
when we're all gonna
have to say adios.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.601
Some of us, forever.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.436
I want to make sure you guys
remember all the broments

32:59.521 --> 33:01.305
that we had together,

33:01.389 --> 33:03.190
and the great things
we accomplished, forever.

33:03.257 --> 33:06.026
I know I haven't always been
the perfect friend or teammate,

33:06.094 --> 33:07.945
but you've stuck by me,
forgiven me

33:08.029 --> 33:09.279
for sleeping with your women.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.532
Not everyone in my life
has done that.

33:11.599 --> 33:13.200
One cougar's husband even
chased me around with a gun.

33:13.267 --> 33:15.369
Anyways...

33:15.436 --> 33:17.538
I'm only gonna say this once...

33:18.773 --> 33:19.940
...but I'm going to
miss all of you.

33:21.576 --> 33:22.609
I love you guys.

33:23.778 --> 33:27.381
Cheers.

33:29.501 --> 33:31.451
I'm a little confused as to
what we're doing here.

33:31.503 --> 33:33.887
Well, um, Kurt said
that you two might need

33:33.955 --> 33:35.089
a little couple's counseling.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.473
Are you qualified for that?

33:36.541 --> 33:38.342
Not really. Or at all.

33:38.426 --> 33:39.460
But Sam and Mercedes

33:39.527 --> 33:41.061
came to talk to me,

33:41.129 --> 33:43.347
and you know, I-I think they
found it pretty helpful.

33:43.431 --> 33:44.815
Yeah, I'm-I'm pretty
sure they broke up.

33:44.899 --> 33:47.151
Gosh, they seemed like
such a good fit, too, right?

33:47.235 --> 33:50.204
Brutal honesty is the
cornerstone of any relationship.

33:50.271 --> 33:51.822
I want you to feel like

33:51.906 --> 33:54.024
this is a safe space for you
to air your differences.

33:54.109 --> 33:55.475
Okay.

33:55.527 --> 33:57.344
Well, uh, first...

33:57.412 --> 33:58.779
Kurt has been
texting this guy,

33:58.830 --> 34:01.331
and I got really upset.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.083
Although, a while back,

34:03.151 --> 34:05.035
I was sort of doing
the same thing.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.204
But it wasn't... With the
guy who almost blinded him.

34:07.288 --> 34:09.723
Blaine, I sang you a song
to express my regrets.

34:09.791 --> 34:11.091
Okay, if we're here,

34:11.159 --> 34:12.543
to be brutally honest,

34:12.627 --> 34:14.460
there are a few things
that I'd like to change.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.463
I am actively listening.

34:16.514 --> 34:17.547
Well, for starters,
Kurt has a tendency

34:17.632 --> 34:19.550
to snap his fingers
at wait staff.

34:19.634 --> 34:21.101
The cheesecake's on its way,
Kurt, you don't have to

34:21.168 --> 34:22.719
snap your fingers, it's not
gonna make it come any faster.

34:22.804 --> 34:24.054
Okay, I hear you,

34:24.139 --> 34:25.556
and that's something
I'm willing to work on.

34:25.639 --> 34:28.225
Also, please stop slipping
bronzer into my moisturizer.

34:28.309 --> 34:29.059
You look good
with a little color.

34:29.143 --> 34:31.011
I only use lotion on my hands.

34:31.062 --> 34:33.864
It looks weird if a person
just has tan hands.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.114
Okay, Kurt, wouldn't
you love Blaine

34:35.183 --> 34:37.117
just as much if he
didn't havtan hands?

34:37.185 --> 34:38.534
And while we're
being perfectly honest,

34:38.620 --> 34:40.353
I don't like that
with every conversation,

34:40.405 --> 34:41.989
we end up always
talking about NYADA.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.408
What song you're gonna sing,

34:44.492 --> 34:46.543
what outfit you're gonna
wear to your callback,

34:46.628 --> 34:49.862
how amazing New York is.

34:49.914 --> 34:52.799
New York is the only thing
we talk about now, Kurt,

34:52.867 --> 34:53.867
and it's like...

34:55.920 --> 34:58.138
...well, it's like you can't
even wait to get out of here.

34:59.724 --> 35:01.225
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

35:02.760 --> 35:05.012
In a few months,

35:05.063 --> 35:08.015
you're gonna be gone.

35:08.066 --> 35:10.434
With this brand-new life,

35:10.518 --> 35:12.552
these brand-new friends,
brand-new everything,

35:12.604 --> 35:15.022
and I'm gonna be right here.

35:15.073 --> 35:16.423
By myself.

35:19.060 --> 35:22.279
You're right.

35:22.363 --> 35:24.898
I have been distant.

35:24.949 --> 35:26.533
And I'm sorry.

35:26.584 --> 35:28.118
But I'm just...

35:28.203 --> 35:31.371
trying to practice what life is
going to be like without you.

35:34.325 --> 35:36.460
You are the love
of my life, Kurt.

35:36.544 --> 35:38.262
And I'm pissed off

35:38.346 --> 35:41.265
that I have to learn,
for the next year,

35:41.349 --> 35:42.766
what being alone
is gonna be like.

35:42.850 --> 35:45.285
But you're not gonna be alone.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.187
I'm gonna Skype you every day,

35:47.255 --> 35:49.556
and you're gonna come visit me
in New York every weekend

35:49.607 --> 35:50.774
as far as I'm concerned.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.943
But I promise,

35:53.027 --> 35:54.511
you aren't gonna lose me.

35:55.697 --> 35:57.814
I love you so much.

35:57.899 --> 35:59.766
I love you, too.

36:09.327 --> 36:10.661
Champagne.

36:10.745 --> 36:12.496
On a Tuesday.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.414
We've gone all Hunter S.
Thompson, haven't we?

36:14.465 --> 36:15.782
For the bride.
Thank you.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.084
We are celebrating.

36:18.253 --> 36:19.836
Who needs Mr. Lavender?

36:19.921 --> 36:22.506
I have found the perfect
wedding location.

36:22.590 --> 36:24.591
You did?

36:24.642 --> 36:27.627
The K.O.A. campground
by Route Nine.

36:27.679 --> 36:29.429
A campground?

36:29.480 --> 36:30.564
Think about it.

36:30.631 --> 36:32.132
They've got plenty of
space for a stage,

36:32.183 --> 36:33.767
the electrical hookups
they use for the RVs

36:33.818 --> 36:36.770
have plenty of juice for all
the amps and the instruments,

36:36.821 --> 36:39.606
and they're leaving the
restrooms open for us

36:39.657 --> 36:41.742
so everyone doesn't have to
walk around with quarters.

36:41.809 --> 36:43.910
It, uh, sounds a bit rustic.

36:43.978 --> 36:46.479
Married under the stars...

36:46.531 --> 36:48.415
it's... babe, it's romantic.

36:48.482 --> 36:49.866
I have OCD.

36:49.951 --> 36:51.318
I throw away a broom

36:51.369 --> 36:52.703
after I've used it once,

36:52.787 --> 36:54.588
and you think I want to
get married at a campground?

36:54.655 --> 36:56.423
I- I know it's not ideal,

36:56.490 --> 36:58.008
but it was the only place
that was available.

36:58.092 --> 37:00.294
Unless we move
the wedding to November.

37:00.345 --> 37:02.045
I won't do that.

37:02.130 --> 37:04.164
Will, the Glee kids will
come back for the wedding

37:04.215 --> 37:05.332
if it's in November.
What if they don't?

37:10.972 --> 37:14.141
I'm sorry.

37:22.367 --> 37:25.569
I just don't want them to leave.

37:25.636 --> 37:28.455
You know, that's the wonderful
thing about being a teacher.

37:28.522 --> 37:32.376
Every year you get a new
group of kids to inspire you.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.494
Yeah, but these kids
changed my life.

37:34.545 --> 37:37.164
Three years ago,
I was just a Spanish teacher

37:37.215 --> 37:42.052
sitting here with Terri telling
me to go be an accountant.

37:42.136 --> 37:45.722
But now I'm going to Nationals
for the second time, and...

37:45.807 --> 37:48.008
and I'm marrying you.

37:48.059 --> 37:49.643
It'll never like this again.

37:49.710 --> 37:52.562
You know, you and the kids
gave each other a gift.

37:52.647 --> 37:55.732
But the love that
you have for each other,

37:55.817 --> 37:57.150
you keep it with you.

37:57.218 --> 37:58.769
That never goes away.

37:58.853 --> 38:00.220
I'm just going to
miss them so much.

38:00.271 --> 38:02.105
They know.

38:03.408 --> 38:06.743
Which is why, you know,
if-if you and I

38:06.828 --> 38:08.995
had our wedding ten years
from now, on the moon,

38:09.063 --> 38:10.397
those kids would be there.

38:10.448 --> 38:13.133
Would you prefer that
to the campground?

38:19.943 --> 38:22.077
Is that, is that too much?
Hm-mm.

38:29.068 --> 38:30.703
Is that, um...

38:32.539 --> 38:34.373
I'm so sorry.

38:35.809 --> 38:37.176
It's okay.

38:37.243 --> 38:38.577
It happens.

38:38.628 --> 38:39.795
It's just that you are

38:39.879 --> 38:42.414
the prettiest, nicest,

38:42.465 --> 38:44.350
best-smelling girl
I've ever met.

38:44.417 --> 38:45.851
How many girls
have you met?

38:45.918 --> 38:46.918
Weren't you homeschooled?

38:46.970 --> 38:48.387
Don't do that.

38:48.438 --> 38:50.922
Don't find ways to
run yourself down.

38:50.974 --> 38:52.891
I guess I have been
doing that a lot lately.

38:54.761 --> 38:56.895
It's just hard not to
focus on what I've lost.

38:56.947 --> 38:59.097
What if I helped you?
Like the way

38:59.149 --> 39:00.733
I use my hands
to move your legs...

39:00.784 --> 39:02.985
maybe you could use
my eyes to see yourself,

39:03.069 --> 39:04.236
the way I see you.

39:04.304 --> 39:06.205
And what would I see?

39:06.272 --> 39:07.790
Perfection.

39:10.293 --> 39:13.128
So... what are you
looking for, here?

39:13.213 --> 39:15.247
I mean, do you want me
to be your girlfriend?

39:17.417 --> 39:18.334
I don't know.

39:18.418 --> 39:20.952
I mean, yes, totally,

39:21.004 --> 39:22.421
but my faith means
everything to me.

39:22.472 --> 39:24.974
It's just that
when I'm with you,

39:25.058 --> 39:27.259
I don't care what God says
about sins of the flesh.

39:27.310 --> 39:29.979
I just want to know what
it'd feel like to be...

39:30.063 --> 39:31.313
right up next to you.

39:31.398 --> 39:34.132
You would give up
your faith to be with me?

39:34.184 --> 39:35.967
I don't know.

39:36.019 --> 39:37.302
Are you asking me to?

39:37.354 --> 39:38.804
No.

39:38.855 --> 39:40.322
No, never.

39:40.407 --> 39:43.275
Because you don't
like me that way.

39:43.326 --> 39:45.527
No, because it's
nice knowing that

39:45.612 --> 39:47.363
there's something out
there that can't be lost.

39:52.369 --> 39:54.186
All right, help me up.

40:00.993 --> 40:02.461
Well, so what is this?

40:02.512 --> 40:03.962
About you and me?

40:04.014 --> 40:06.331
I don't know.

40:06.383 --> 40:07.866
Something new.

40:12.856 --> 40:14.773
I love your
jauntily placed cap,

40:14.841 --> 40:16.608
like a Russian Tsar.

40:18.010 --> 40:20.011
It's not Chandler.

40:20.063 --> 40:22.231
I swear I told him
not to text me anymore.

40:22.315 --> 40:24.233
I know. It's from me.

40:26.403 --> 40:29.621
How unscheduled of you.

40:29.689 --> 40:30.622
But what about Glee practice?
