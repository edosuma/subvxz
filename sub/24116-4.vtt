00:06.005 --> 00:07.966
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:21.396 --> 00:23.815
[Edha]  I can't keep moving forward
without looking back.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.403
I've always needed
a piece of the past to be creative...

00:32.824 --> 00:35.493
...but now I need to move
beyond memories.

00:36.077 --> 00:40.373
Cross the threshold,
enter that dark place in my mind...

00:40.707 --> 00:42.709
...where we keep what we want to forget.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.177
[heavy breathing]

00:57.932 --> 01:01.019
[gasping]

01:11.404 --> 01:14.949
[inhales sharply]

01:28.046 --> 01:30.048
[Edha]  Teo connects me with this darkness.

01:31.216 --> 01:36.471
His skin, his eyes, his shape,
they take me to the mystery of my past.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.848
[weaving machine whirs]

01:39.933 --> 01:42.435
[Edha]  Teo is my model, I found him.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.232
I'll reveal the weave of my past
through his body.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.644
I saw the patterns. They're the same
Manito had at the factory.

02:24.727 --> 02:25.645
The originals.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.148
So?

02:28.606 --> 02:30.775
What do you mean, "so?"
The patterns at Edha's place.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.278
Yes, your brother worked for Edha.
What's new?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.406
Are you still angry? I said I'm sorry.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.993
-I have to go.
-Don't leave now, Pija's outside.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.537
I know. Pija doesn't mess with me.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.082
You work for Edha now? You got in?

02:47.584 --> 02:48.585
Yes.

02:48.835 --> 02:49.669
Hmm.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.254
[she laughs]

02:51.337 --> 02:53.006
-I have to go.
-Where are you going?

02:53.631 --> 02:56.259
-I'll be back in a second.
-I asked where, not how long.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.430
You have your life, I have mine!

03:02.098 --> 03:03.558
What job did she give you?

03:04.642 --> 03:05.643
Running errands.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.770
-Errands?
-[Teo] Yes, errands.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.772
But I'm in, I'll find something.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.399
I hope so.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.571
[door closes]

03:28.708 --> 03:32.420
They want to dress women,
they want what you showed at Fashion Week.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.506
I'm not going to dress women.
I'll only dress men now.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.550
You wanted "inclusive beauty"?

03:37.634 --> 03:40.386
I have the aesthetic concept.
I have the ideal model.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.430
It's the female line we want.

03:42.513 --> 03:46.017
The Inés collection isn't feminine
nor masculine, it has no gender.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.644
It's seduction, refuge.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.562
-OK--
-This is what I'll do.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.648
We have nothing left to talk about.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.526
Well, we could study it, right?

03:55.610 --> 03:58.571
We can design something new
and talk during the week, OK?

03:58.655 --> 03:59.739
No, it's not OK.

04:00.156 --> 04:03.409
You can work without inspiration, I can't.

04:03.493 --> 04:08.539
-Edha, you're taking things too far--
-I don't want this for me.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.584
The company can make a new design.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.922
You're not giving us any guarantee.
We can't work with total unpredictability.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.258
The only thing I have is my truth.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.970
I'm tired of pretending. Excuse me.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.847
[footsteps moving away]

04:32.397 --> 04:36.109
[Ronnie] Antonio, why do you have to come?
You have nothing to do with this.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.404
-Antonio knows what to say.
-Pastene, I'm not talking to you.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.948
-All the same, I don't like this.
-Calm down.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.575
[Ronnie] Antonio,
you don't have to do this.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.704
You've given proof of your loyalty.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.416
I'm fine. Wait for me outside.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.584
No way. I'm coming with you.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.003
They're waiting for us.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.046
Yes, let's go.

05:01.426 --> 05:05.513
-[Judge] You knew about the sweatshop?
-I did, yes. For some time.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.598
-Did you know it?
-[Antonio] Sorry?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.978
-Did you know the place personally?
-Yes.

05:12.061 --> 05:16.691
-That means you were inside the sweatshop?
-[Antonio] Yes.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.735
-When?
-Six months ago.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.487
Are you sure?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.073
Yes.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.867
-And you didn't return?
-[Antonio] No.

05:27.076 --> 05:31.748
[Judge] Yet, I have here a record of you
leaving the sweatshop.

05:32.373 --> 05:37.045
And according to the dates here,
it would be from the same day of the fire.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.465
Do you have a twin brother?

05:42.425 --> 05:45.136
You visited the sweatshop frequently.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.929
You're detained for 24 hours

05:47.013 --> 05:48.723
until your situation is resolved.

06:01.652 --> 06:05.448
I told you that was it, Yastin.
I did it to pay Medina.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.700
You didn't enjoy it?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.453
I don't want to keep doing it, man!

06:11.412 --> 06:14.123
What will you do for money?
You don't want to model,

06:14.290 --> 06:17.126
you don't want to sell,
you waste all your talents.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.587
-What will you do?
-It was an emergency.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.423
-I needed the money.
-[Yastin] Yeah, that's why I helped you.

06:23.341 --> 06:27.261
This is what we'll do, take a day off,
get some rest, then come see me.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.264
[Yastin] I think you'll say
you thought it over,

06:30.348 --> 06:34.268
and you realized Teo's going to fuck off
and leave you alone.

06:34.352 --> 06:38.147
And when that happens,
you'll have your own thing, kid, easy.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.737
This orange suits you. Here, have it.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.366
Thank you.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.419
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.676
[Edha] You look good, not bad.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.138
I miss you.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.598
You should be with me.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.728
I want to show you this.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.731
Remember the kid who helped you
at Fashion Week?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.693
I'm designing for him.

07:24.318 --> 07:27.155
I want him to be
the face of the collection.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.782
I started with Inés and ended with him.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.452
You finally discovered men.

07:33.202 --> 07:36.289
There are others besides Lorenzo,
much more interesting.

07:37.415 --> 07:41.461
Look, I want to add this,
but I don't know how.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.131
Where?

07:46.048 --> 07:47.925
[Edha] On the wrists, neck...

07:48.468 --> 07:52.513
But it's too harlequin, grotesque,
that's not the idea. What do you think?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.348
I can't think.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.561
You're right. Think about it tomorrow
at home or in the workshop.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.021
[Antonio] I doubt it.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.940
Lorenzo is taking care of it.
Those pictures surprised me.

08:03.024 --> 08:07.069
-I didn't know you went to the factory.
-Many things work without your knowledge.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.198
I went there twice.
Once when they set it up and again.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.784
The lawyer made me deny it. He said
they had no evidence to contradict me.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.870
That's why you missed Odette's exhibition.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.915
That's why.
Because I was working.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.043
And because your dad was going crazy
with the export samples.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.712
And because someone had to sit
before all those people

08:24.795 --> 08:27.632
and explain what the foreman couldn't,
that's why I'm here.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.181
Why didn't you tell me
you were going there?

08:35.264 --> 08:38.434
That you visited the sweatshop?
We don't work that way.

08:38.768 --> 08:42.647
To make the delivery, the sample
was almost finished. We were so close.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.274
I couldn't screw it up.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.443
You had to screw it up.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.698
I'll talk to Jáuregui
and get you out of here.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.367
I'm going.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.958
[cell door opens]

09:07.380 --> 09:08.798
[cell door closes]

09:09.840 --> 09:11.884
-[Bárbara] They're great, right?
-Gorgeous.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.595
-[Jáuregui] She looks very professional.
-Yes.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.682
The advert you're working on,
is it closed?

09:17.765 --> 09:20.810
No, not yet.
She can audition if she wants.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.145
-An advert?
-Would you like to?

09:24.105 --> 09:26.399
Yes, I don't know. My mom wouldn't.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.025
[laughs]

09:28.109 --> 09:31.904
You have to benefit from your looks.
Now, while you're young.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.322
This is the time.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.741
You don't want to hide behind your wishes.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.411
If you don't try, it's worse. Right?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.788
Exactly! Try it, and see if you like it.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.085
[Edha] I can't go on.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.131
-[Lorenzo] Ask Florencia to help you.
-No, not Florencia.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.675
She's willful, but she lacks creativity,

09:52.758 --> 09:56.053
craziness,
everything Antonio has to spare.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.472
It's important you finish
some of the new stuff.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.933
We lost the investors because of a whim.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.394
Prove that this will get us to Milan.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.730
Or let's start a pasta factory.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.816
You can do that
when you finish with Antonio.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.901
It's your fault he was locked up.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.782
You said you wanted to design for men.
What do we do with that doodle?

10:16.866 --> 10:20.077
I want Teo as a model.
Make a deal with him.

10:20.161 --> 10:23.748
As a model? I thought he was going
to help Aníbal carry things.

10:23.831 --> 10:28.336
You thought wrong. He has great potential.
I won't do it without him.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.431
[indistinct chatter]

10:41.223 --> 10:45.895
[El Pija] People haven't forgotten
about the fire. We don't want you here.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.939
Eh?

11:05.373 --> 11:07.708
-Let's go.
-Are you in a hurry?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.377
I don't like waiting.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.174
[motor starts]

11:27.937 --> 11:29.939
[Ronnie exhales heavily]

11:32.316 --> 11:34.276
The lawyer coached him badly on purpose.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.321
You delivered Antonio to save yourself.

11:37.405 --> 11:41.283
Ronnie, who knew there were pictures
of Antonio at the factory?

11:41.367 --> 11:44.203
He's not allowed to speak to anyone.

11:44.286 --> 11:48.582
There's nothing more annoying to me
than having my coffee break interrupted.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.713
I'll get help, I won't leave him alone.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.591
Fine, you're a good husband,
do what you have to do.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.553
I'll be here if you need anything.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.528
[Sebastián] With these prescriptions
and your dad's stamp...

12:17.611 --> 12:20.030
-[Delfina] Make the downward mark.
-[Sebastián] We'll clean out the pharmacy.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.116
[rapping]  When I rhyme still, I distill

12:22.199 --> 12:25.244
This is my thing
You know brother, in you I'm trusting

12:25.327 --> 12:26.954
I'm trusting and I have a vision

12:27.037 --> 12:29.832
That's why I'm always flying
Outside of this prison...

12:30.207 --> 12:33.878
Did you trade me for another?
It's all right, I'm not jealous.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.175
-How's it going?
-Very well.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.386
-How did that go?
-Great.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.180
Cool.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.389
[Mati laughs]

12:47.475 --> 12:50.060
-[Delfina] Mati's the one for you.
-I don't want him.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.147
-[Elena] Can we go to my place?
-Why?

12:53.230 --> 12:54.773
For a change.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.276
You think? We can't do anything there.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.694
Yes, we can. Let's go.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.655
Yeah, I have some really yummy buds.

13:01.739 --> 13:02.907
You're my little bud.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.285
[rapping in background, group cheers]

13:06.368 --> 13:10.873
[rapping]  All the time, a couple rhymes
With my brothers we ad-lib

13:10.956 --> 13:12.791
We ad-lib, never butt in

13:12.875 --> 13:15.961
Hoisting Argentina's flag of the mambo,
Of Diego Armando...

13:16.045 --> 13:18.255
[Jáuregui] Mmm alcohol, so early?

13:18.923 --> 13:21.217
Ah, moralizing and self-righteous,
so young?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.969
-Not so young now.
-All the more so then.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.096
[Jáuregui] Hmm.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.851
You've come about the factory fire.

13:31.352 --> 13:35.856
For Antonio, I need you to get him out.
He has nothing to do with it.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.942
I can't get people out.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.860
That's not true.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.156
Elena? I barely see her lately.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.118
She now sees her father.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.290
-I forgot how possessive you are.
-Will you get him out?

13:53.791 --> 13:54.833
Wrong question.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.044
Will you help me get Antonio out?

13:57.127 --> 13:58.587
-And you?
-What?

13:58.671 --> 13:59.505
Will you help me?

14:00.130 --> 14:01.840
I knew it'd be expensive.

14:02.174 --> 14:06.554
Beating around the bush isn't very
skillful on your part, if it's a favor.

14:06.637 --> 14:11.016
You're seeing Elena with my permission.
I helped to make that happen.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.769
-What else do you want?
-To acknowledge her.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.147
-Give her my surname.
-She's 16 years old.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.942
Her family wants her with them.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.778
What? You lack her picture?

14:23.445 --> 14:25.781
Or your role as a parent
became imperative?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.701
The only imperative is my bond with Elena.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.288
It should be positive for you too.

14:32.788 --> 14:36.166
No, the answer is no.
She has my surname.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.002
I'm her mother, I raised her.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.671
Think about it.
You don't have to answer now.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.883
I know how important Antonio is to you.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.220
We should reflect on this.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.362
[music plays over stereo]

15:05.446 --> 15:06.614
It hasn't grown much.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.035
-What hasn't?
-The plant. It takes forever to grow.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.120
We'll never be able to smoke it.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.665
We have to look for a bigger plant pot.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.087
[Delfina] Sebi's not coming, I know him.

15:22.796 --> 15:26.425
Your dad knows you smoke.
He'll confront you about it.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.386
-No way.
-I'm telling you, he knows.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.306
I know he knows, but he's a pussy.

15:32.389 --> 15:36.143
-Don't say that about him.
-Sorry? What's up with you?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.354
Nothing.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.523
Stop moving my stuff, it's all tidy.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.152
Yes, I realized. The perfect room,
the perfect daughter.

15:45.736 --> 15:46.779
What a bitch.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.033
I'm leaving, you're a pain in the ass,
there's nothing to do.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.327
We always go to your house.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.578
No one forces you.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.957
I didn't force you either, go if you want.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.042
I came because you insisted!

16:00.125 --> 16:02.503
What's wrong with my house? What happened?

16:04.713 --> 16:05.547
Go on.

16:06.131 --> 16:06.966
What?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.258
Just go.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.117
WHERE ARE YOU? CAN WE MEET TODAY?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.792
[cellphone vibrates]

16:42.167 --> 16:44.420
JULIÁN: TONIGHT AT THE HOSPITAL.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.515
-Who are you?
-I'm the owner of Edha.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.726
Wasn't the girl the owner?

16:58.809 --> 17:00.978
When you need to talk, you see me.

17:01.603 --> 17:05.315
The girl, Edha, my daughter,
is not to be bothered. OK?

17:06.066 --> 17:09.903
-Got it.
-These are confidentiality agreements.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.655
The best thing that could happen to you.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.033
Mutual legal responsibility.

17:14.908 --> 17:18.996
The girl made this happen. Thank her.
For us, it's one more contract.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.417
For you it's salvation,
if you take advantage. Sign it.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.131
Very good.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.011
Take this, Aníbal.
What? That's not necessary.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.721
To remember.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.848
-Good. You going with him?
-Yes. Let's go.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.808
-A pleasure.
-[Aníbal] Please.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.110
[cellphone vibrates]

17:52.988 --> 17:54.615
Mom, I'm with Dad.

17:55.699 --> 17:58.952
Then I'm going to Delfi's
to help her study. See you later.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.122
[footsteps]

18:07.086 --> 18:09.004
Would you leave us a moment, please?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.547
-Huh?
-Hmm.

18:10.631 --> 18:11.507
Thanks.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.100
Are you OK? You're bored.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.644
I feel ill, I want to go.

18:23.727 --> 18:27.147
This is what you like, what you want.
Don't be afraid.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.237
[inhales deeply]

18:33.320 --> 18:34.530
Elen.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.282
This is easy.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.244
There are only four of five
possible expressions.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.287
Your dad works like this.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.541
Economic magazine face.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.838
Social event face or... fundraising gala.

18:51.463 --> 18:55.759
That picture will go in a tiny box
on page 8 of the papers.

18:56.051 --> 19:01.056
So I can smile with my whole face
and show these awful crow's feet,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.433
or these marks that don't come off.
You laugh!

19:03.851 --> 19:06.854
You laugh but you have to stay on top.
Look.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.526
Independent magazine. No tie,
with a sweater around my shoulders.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.862
Liberal smile.

19:14.945 --> 19:19.241
See? With four or five expressions,
you can make a whole career.

19:19.783 --> 19:20.784
Elen.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.745
If I can make all those expressions...

19:24.413 --> 19:27.332
...imagine what you can do with that face.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.251
Eh?

19:32.796 --> 19:34.006
Come on, let's go.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.552
-Will you come with me?
-You do it alone.

19:43.765 --> 19:48.103
[electronic music plays]

19:52.399 --> 19:54.026
[camera shutter sounds]

19:55.485 --> 19:56.987
[camera shutter sounds]

20:29.603 --> 20:31.855
-A parka with this print?
-Yes.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.818
-The wallpaper design is Odette's?
-[sighing] Yes.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.365
Was she your lover?

20:42.491 --> 20:43.742
[he chuckles]

20:44.451 --> 20:46.119
I asked you a question.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.581
Odette liked to provoke
and I'm not made of stone, darling.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.377
Your mother also had her liberties.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.547
-Did Mom know you had a relationship?
-It wasn't a relationship.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.591
I'd like to hear the truth.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.522
-Show me what you signed.
-I don't have it.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.692
-No contract?
-No, they don't give it to you.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.736
-Not even a copy?
-I said no.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.573
But it seems the company's owner
is the father, this guy.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.244
-They have to give you a copy.
-I'll ask.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.163
It's a permit to use my face.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.790
Your face?

21:31.873 --> 21:33.292
What contract did you sign?

21:33.917 --> 21:34.793
For modeling.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.044
[laughs]

21:36.128 --> 21:37.587
What are you laughing at?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.299
What matters is I got in.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.467
Without a copy, there's no contract.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.969
That's not Edha's job.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.097
-This guy makes the decisions.
-It's her!

21:47.556 --> 21:49.182
What is the brand's fucking name?

22:12.414 --> 22:15.000
[Celia] They burned it to the ground,
I can't believe it...

23:09.137 --> 23:10.389
[metal clanging]

23:43.296 --> 23:46.091
[Edha]  I was never interested
in dressing men.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.343
But it's different with Teo.

23:49.636 --> 23:52.139
I'll cover him with my own mystery...

23:52.889 --> 23:54.724
...with my own pain.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.937
My mother lives in this pattern...

23:59.020 --> 24:00.689
...in this infinite symbol.

24:11.158 --> 24:16.037
To dress someone is to uncover them.
To wrap, to cover, to put layers on.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.500
It is showing what is hidden.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.261
Even if it means
putting everything at risk,

24:31.344 --> 24:34.139
I'm going to dress Teo
to uncover my truth.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.437
[cellphone rings]

24:40.520 --> 24:41.438
Hello?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.190
[Jáuregui]  Where are you?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.358
Studying with Delfi, my friend.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.484
[Jáuregui]  See you later?

24:46.568 --> 24:48.528
No, I'm going home today.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.197
[Jáuregui]  To your mother's place?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.781
-Yes.
-[Jáuregui]  Tomorrow then.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.827
-Tomorrow, yes. Bye.
- [Jáuregui]  Bye.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.664
I can't face her.

25:01.499 --> 25:02.918
What can I do?

25:04.419 --> 25:06.838
Take her out of school, I can't see her.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.049
That makes no sense. It's very selfish.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.093
How is Delfina to blame for what happened?

25:13.762 --> 25:16.640
-No, she isn't.
-Right, she isn't.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.394
It was an accident.
It can't happen again, OK?

25:21.478 --> 25:23.521
I don't want to stop seeing you.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.732
I just don't feel well.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.862
Do you understand how serious this is?

25:35.700 --> 25:38.703
I saw a woman, not a girl, I made a move.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.207
I didn't think you'd react this way.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.085
Obviously I misjudged.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.715
-I feel very guilty.
-These things happen.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.217
Don't punish yourself.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.887
You're going to be all right.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.973
Right?

25:59.891 --> 26:02.560
Promise me you'll be all right.

26:11.319 --> 26:13.530
-Get a hotel.
-They haven't paid, Mota.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.449
You shouldn't come to the neighborhood,
it's a huge mafia,

26:16.533 --> 26:18.493
They could be after us.

26:18.576 --> 26:22.414
We planted the labels!
We have to be careful.

26:22.497 --> 26:25.041
If it wasn't because of the factory?

26:25.125 --> 26:26.960
-Why else?
-Celia, what's the matter?

26:27.043 --> 26:30.338
No, nothing, the neighbors,
the victims' families, I don't know.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.341
It doesn't matter. We have to get away.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.018
[knocking on door]

26:43.101 --> 26:44.394
[Edha] Yes?

26:49.232 --> 26:50.400
Coming in?

26:50.483 --> 26:51.568
-Can I?
-Yes.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.044
You're crazy, Mom.

27:11.129 --> 27:15.342
-And that look?
-An audition. Don't get mad.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.510
No, I won't get mad.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.220
I got selected.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.766
What is that?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.685
Some tests. Audition for what?

27:25.769 --> 27:29.272
An advert. It's very well paid.

27:30.690 --> 27:31.900
This isn't working.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.861
Are you OK?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.368
[sighs]

27:43.453 --> 27:45.705
-Am I good?
-Good at what?

27:45.789 --> 27:46.873
A good mother.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.000
[laughs]

27:50.043 --> 27:51.503
Yes. Very.

27:52.921 --> 27:53.838
Do I look after you?

27:54.964 --> 27:55.882
Yes.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.308
-Can I tell you something?
-Yes.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.560
I'm staying at Dad's for a few days.

28:09.687 --> 28:10.814
You liked Jáuregui?

28:11.606 --> 28:12.774
A little, yes.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.318
There's something else.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.862
I met someone.

28:19.989 --> 28:24.536
It's amazing, your father's ability
to always land on his feet. Admirable.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.705
Forgiving him says good things about you.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.835
-And you can't? After all this time?
-No.

28:31.918 --> 28:36.047
When Lorenzo found out I was pregnant,
he wanted to kill him.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.049
He said I lied.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.177
-What do you mean, "lied"?
-He played the victim.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.723
He said he'd never known my age,
he could go to prison,

28:44.806 --> 28:46.975
If he'd known,
he wouldn't have come near me.

28:48.226 --> 28:52.605
He knew fine well that I was 16,
just like you.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.983
A son of a bitch.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.360
And grandpa?

28:57.694 --> 28:59.237
Grandpa wanted to kill him...

28:59.821 --> 29:01.573
So I said...

29:01.656 --> 29:03.116
...that I'd lied.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.077
But it's over now.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.455
Tell me, you met someone?

29:09.914 --> 29:12.083
No, no, it's not important.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.967
[DA Ramos] This is pretty unusual.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.219
[Pastene] I agree,
but the judge asked for it.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.930
[DA Ramos] Yes, but no one notified me.

29:26.347 --> 29:30.393
He can do that. I just found out
and I have to be notified.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.520
Yes, but this is good for you.

29:33.688 --> 29:37.817
You think because you put someone
in prison, that I'll conform?

29:38.359 --> 29:40.695
The man I'm defending
is vital for the company.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.655
A kidney.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.617
If you're saying we gave him up,
you're mistaken.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.204
I'm not saying anything,
I'm telling you directly.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.499
Stop being so bitter, look at yourself.

29:52.582 --> 29:56.002
You look sick. Have you lost weight?

29:57.003 --> 29:58.963
No, no... I'm the same.

29:59.756 --> 30:00.965
Must be the clothes.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.467
[Pastene laughs]

30:02.550 --> 30:05.303
Considering the lack of veracity
in your statement,

30:05.386 --> 30:09.390
I proceed to dictate a pretrial detention
according to Section 32

30:09.474 --> 30:12.018
of the Criminal Procedure Code
and its derivatives.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.437
-I want my protest on the records.
-[Judge] It will be.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.524
Meanwhile, let's carry out
the specified court order.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.108
-I don't understand.
-Be calm.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.985
I'm indicting you, sir.

30:22.028 --> 30:25.031
[Judge] Keep the documents
and proceed with the detention.

30:25.448 --> 30:30.036
You're detained for multiple
homicide with malice aforethought.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.288
[Antonio] But Pastene,
you said I'd be out today.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.228
-What time is it?
-Early.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.855
[Teo] Are you going out?

30:57.522 --> 30:58.773
To see about a job.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.360
A job? What are you up to, Celia?

31:02.443 --> 31:05.989
Nothing. You're not the only one
signing contracts.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.658
Stay a while.

31:08.741 --> 31:12.245
-We have to pay for this.
-I'll get paid for the fitting.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.707
-Come on, stay.
-To see you try on clothes?

31:16.958 --> 31:19.043
I've signed. They have to pay me.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.588
If it's not enough, then look.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.173
Your balls are not enough, Teo.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.594
You're becoming too soft, a pussy.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.637
So, I'm going to look for a job.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.016
You're forgetting why you got in there.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.562
-You're forgetting your brother.
-I'm not forgetting.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.946
This is Antonio's but I'm giving it to you
as a show of trust.

31:47.030 --> 31:51.159
Commission for a job we did together.
Keep his cut safe.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.412
-Why now?
-It's the right thing.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.956
Your dad's lawyer
did everything wrong on purpose.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.958
-Antonio did everything wrong.
-Huh?

31:59.042 --> 32:01.377
For not telling me
he'd been to the factory!

32:01.920 --> 32:04.839
Lorenzo chose Pastene,
they've worked together for years.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.633
Is that a guarantee?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.470
You've no idea what your dad
is capable of.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.857
One pill less and you're fucking gone.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.318
We work neatly here. No fuck-ups.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.695
Look at this one.

32:27.779 --> 32:31.658
She started as promo-ho and now
she thinks she's Lady Di, unbelievable!

32:36.955 --> 32:38.289
Did you burn my house?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.335
-Stop with the nonsense.
-It was you.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.879
-Who told you that?
-I'm being looked after.

32:44.963 --> 32:48.883
No one's looking after you.
That's why your shack burned down.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.844
You left the neighborhood,
you got left alone with Medina,

32:52.261 --> 32:53.972
and now you're here, alone.

32:54.055 --> 32:57.809
It wasn't Yastin. It's best if you stay
close to us, they might return.

32:58.267 --> 33:01.187
-Was it Medina?
-I don't know. Could be.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.192
Listen. I'll train you and get you
into something new of mine.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.318
Stop being the loser.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.238
You'll have a better time.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.085
[car door opens]

33:26.921 --> 33:29.590
-What's up?
-Give me your phone.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.137
Call me from this one.
Your girlfriend too.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.348
-What's the problem?
-Could be many.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.810
-Any news?
-Two. One good, the other not so much.

33:40.893 --> 33:44.564
-OK, talk.
-They put someone in prison for the fire.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.526
-The other one?
-The guy in prison is a nobody.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.655
-So the good one is shit too.
-It is what it is.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.282
-But it's starting to move.
-Hmm.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.826
You're not setting the time here.

33:57.410 --> 34:01.873
You keep working on earning their trust.
We have to wait now.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.251
[keys rattle]

34:10.006 --> 34:11.257
Did I scare you?

34:13.217 --> 34:15.053
You surprised me, you didn't scare me.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.101
-Can I come in?
-We have guests.

34:32.236 --> 34:35.323
It's true no one's here,
but they're coming to pick me up.

34:36.407 --> 34:40.036
They're waiting for my call, to confirm.

34:41.954 --> 34:44.165
You're going about things the wrong way.

34:46.626 --> 34:49.587
Working together doesn't give you
the right to come here.

34:51.964 --> 34:55.885
If it's about the contract,
we can call Lorenzo. Right away.

34:56.761 --> 34:57.804
Are you listening--?

35:10.191 --> 35:11.609
Are you nervous?

35:13.236 --> 35:15.530
If you have nothing to hide...

35:17.198 --> 35:19.325
Are you keeping something to yourself?

35:19.408 --> 35:22.954
You need me, I need you.
But this is not the way.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.414
What things do I want?

35:26.040 --> 35:28.417
We both know what you want.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.502
[breathes deeply]

35:29.585 --> 35:32.171
But we're not animals.
It'd be easier.

35:32.255 --> 35:33.464
[breathes deeply]

35:33.548 --> 35:36.008
-A shame, right?
-That's not what I came for.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.136
What did you come for then?

35:38.219 --> 35:39.345
To see you.

35:40.763 --> 35:43.808
I understand you're confused,
but we're working.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.603
My job is to dress, not undress you.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.274
Your body's a frame. Nothing more.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.860
-A frame?
-Yes.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.702
Will you tell someone what happened here?

36:04.036 --> 36:05.496
Tell what? Nothing happened.

36:33.065 --> 36:35.318
