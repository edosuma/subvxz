10:21.953 --> 10:25.193
Telling me Crazy Horse
had a gimpy leg.

10:25.226 --> 10:27.130
-He did.
-(laughs)

10:27.163 --> 10:30.003
-BROWNIE: I'm a holy man now.
-For fuck's sake.

10:30.036 --> 10:33.275
BROWNIE:
I'll have sacred duties.

10:34.311 --> 10:35.982
Who's he talking to?

10:36.015 --> 10:37.819
I think it's safe to say
he's delusional.

10:37.852 --> 10:39.388
BROWNIE:
Have to set a good example.
Help others.

10:39.421 --> 10:42.160
-Uncle.
-CHEESE: What?

10:42.193 --> 10:44.198
The director's cut
of Big Trouble in Little China?

10:44.231 --> 10:46.102
I've never seen this one.

10:46.135 --> 10:47.939
What the hell
are you kids doing here?

10:47.972 --> 10:49.943
We need help.

10:49.976 --> 10:51.713
No. You caught me
right in the middle

10:51.746 --> 10:53.382
of making myself a better man.

10:55.521 --> 10:57.725
-What's that mean?
-Means "Get the fuck out."

10:57.758 --> 10:58.961
Okay?

10:58.994 --> 10:59.963
The fuck you doing with that?

10:59.996 --> 11:01.231
Oh, i-it was in the trash.

11:02.501 --> 11:04.972
My mistake. Leave me alone.

11:07.444 --> 11:09.347
Fuck it, let's just go in.

11:10.450 --> 11:12.154
Shit's been fucked up, Uncle.

11:12.187 --> 11:14.859
Curse I did
fucking flipped on me.

11:14.892 --> 11:17.498
-Ennit, bro?
-Eh.

11:17.531 --> 11:19.034
WILLIE JACK:
We just need your help.

11:19.067 --> 11:20.805
You used bad medicine,
didn't you?

11:20.838 --> 11:22.441
White medicine.
I know you

11:22.474 --> 11:25.313
told me not to,
but bitch had to go.

11:25.346 --> 11:28.252
Well, you have to go back
to whoever put on the curse

11:28.285 --> 11:29.823
and start there.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.261
I told you, I don't mess
with bad-luck medicine.

11:32.294 --> 11:34.231
You know, you should
really "alphabetecize" these.

11:34.264 --> 11:35.367
What?

11:35.400 --> 11:36.469
It-it just helps,
easier to find.

11:36.503 --> 11:38.306
I-It's why you lost Big Trouble.

11:38.339 --> 11:41.312
Well, I'll pay you some Sonics
if you do it for me.

11:41.345 --> 11:43.483
I can't read
the small letters, so...

11:43.517 --> 11:45.220
Worth it.

11:45.253 --> 11:47.457
Oh, but you got to let me
watch this, though.

11:47.490 --> 11:49.094
-You got it.
-(clicks tongue)

11:49.127 --> 11:50.497
Man.

11:58.847 --> 12:00.350
Think he's gonna stop?

12:00.383 --> 12:03.222
Mm-mmm.
He's probably racist.

12:11.372 --> 12:14.144
-Looks creepy.
-No, he's just white.

12:14.177 --> 12:16.482
Hey. Where you headed?

12:16.516 --> 12:18.218
Uh, we're going to L.A.

12:19.254 --> 12:21.560
L.A., huh? Wow.

12:21.593 --> 12:25.100
I-I could probably
get you as far as Amarillo.

12:25.133 --> 12:27.037
I'm going to that big

12:27.070 --> 12:29.809
white cross with... Jesus.

12:29.842 --> 12:31.278
I'll ride up front.

12:31.311 --> 12:32.881
(soft thudding)

12:34.952 --> 12:36.890
I'm sorry it's, uh, messy.

12:36.923 --> 12:40.230
I haven't had a chance to clean.

12:40.263 --> 12:42.401
-You guys don't mind the mess?
-It's fine.

12:42.434 --> 12:44.004
-You want some Flamers?
-I'm good.

12:44.037 --> 12:45.273
You want some Flamers?
They're my favorite.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.444
-Come on. No?
-I'm fine.

12:47.477 --> 12:50.316
You guys are young.
You don't like Flamers?

12:52.955 --> 12:54.457
I'm Victor.

12:56.930 --> 12:58.298
I'm J-Janet.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.077
I'm Jackson.

13:06.181 --> 13:08.318
Really? Janet and Jackson?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.194
All right.

13:12.227 --> 13:14.866
Well, straight up now, tell me,

13:14.899 --> 13:18.306
do you want to hear some jams
pumped into the car here

13:18.339 --> 13:20.242
and hit the road?

13:23.416 --> 13:26.188
("Wave on Wave" by Pat Green
playing)

13:26.221 --> 13:28.459
This is a good song.

13:28.493 --> 13:30.998
By a singer named Pat Green.

13:31.031 --> 13:33.235
It's not a classic country song.

13:34.237 --> 13:35.875
I like my country more modern.

13:35.908 --> 13:37.979
Not the stuff that's stuck
in the honky-tonks.

13:38.012 --> 13:39.983
I need it on the main stage
to really understand it.

13:40.016 --> 13:41.653
This boy's from Dallas.

13:41.686 --> 13:44.993
You can't argue with a Texan.
Listen to that voice.

13:45.026 --> 13:48.166
Good voice, great body.

13:48.199 --> 13:50.236
That's an entertainer.

13:51.271 --> 13:53.042
The full package.

13:54.478 --> 13:58.218
♪ I was looking for somebody ♪

13:59.555 --> 14:02.160
♪ All I'm looking for is you ♪

14:05.133 --> 14:07.871
♪ You came upon me
wave on wave... ♪

14:09.141 --> 14:11.112
I one time heard
an old man singing

14:11.145 --> 14:14.418
this song at karaoke
and I just fell in love with it.

14:14.451 --> 14:16.488
That's how I remember it.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.364
Sadly, this reminds me
of myself a little bit.

14:23.202 --> 14:26.075
"I wandered out to the water

14:26.108 --> 14:27.612
"to see if I had drowned.

14:27.645 --> 14:29.649
I just know I'm going down."
That part.

14:29.682 --> 14:32.053
That part reminds me of me.

14:32.086 --> 14:34.391
I think he's, like,
he wrote it for me.

14:34.424 --> 14:36.462
(Elora clears throat)

14:36.496 --> 14:37.932
I'm a salesman.
I travel all over.

14:37.965 --> 14:39.602
I sell art.

14:39.635 --> 14:41.338
Framed and matted art,

14:41.371 --> 14:43.409
by painters
like Monet and Van Gogh.

14:43.442 --> 14:45.013
Those are famous painters.

14:45.046 --> 14:47.317
Prints, of course.
Not the real thing.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.221
Those are hard to come by.

14:49.254 --> 14:51.158
Kind of like a good friend.

14:57.270 --> 14:58.940
I have a son.

15:00.009 --> 15:01.580
I don't know him very well.

15:01.613 --> 15:03.382
Another man raises him.

15:04.685 --> 15:06.957
I'm still thinking about
when he was in diapers,

15:06.990 --> 15:09.996
and, uh, now he's in...

15:10.029 --> 15:14.037
roller skates
and jean shorts and...

15:14.070 --> 15:18.145
You know, all the things
teenage boys do and wear.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.718
So, you know
how teenage boys are.

15:20.751 --> 15:22.420
Right?

15:22.453 --> 15:25.226
You two teenage girls?

15:25.259 --> 15:28.198
Surely you must have met
some boys along the way.

15:44.164 --> 15:46.201
Uh, why-why did you turn?

15:47.771 --> 15:49.274
(sniffles)

15:49.307 --> 15:51.278
-Hey, I asked you a question.
-Hmm?

15:51.311 --> 15:53.082
Why did you turn?

15:53.115 --> 15:55.554
Oh, there's just a gas station
further up the road.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.092
Looks like
your tank's half full.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.629
Yeah, but you never know.

15:59.662 --> 16:01.098
Once we hit the Panhandle,
could be a little white

16:01.131 --> 16:02.768
before we hit
another gas station.

16:02.801 --> 16:04.672
You don't want to get
stuck with me, do you?

16:09.447 --> 16:10.618
Where the fuck
are you taking us?

16:10.651 --> 16:11.686
Yeah, we're in the middle
of nowhere.

16:11.719 --> 16:14.057
Just calm down.

16:14.090 --> 16:15.426
-Hey, we asked you a question.
-Relax. Whoa, no, no, no.

16:15.459 --> 16:17.163
-(locks click)
-Lock.

16:17.196 --> 16:19.201
-What the fuck?
-Hey, no swearing.

16:19.234 --> 16:21.038
-I'm gonna fucking kick you
in the fucking face
-Calm down.

16:21.071 --> 16:22.140
-if you don't pull over.
-Whoa, don't-don't

16:22.173 --> 16:23.376
get razzed, don't...
Oh!

16:23.409 --> 16:24.812
-(gasps) Oh, my God.
-Pull over!

16:24.845 --> 16:27.183
What the fuck are you doing?
Stab him!

16:27.216 --> 16:28.520
Stab his ass!

16:28.553 --> 16:29.555
Aah! Aah!

16:29.588 --> 16:32.093
(all screaming)

16:32.126 --> 16:33.362
Oh, my God!

16:33.395 --> 16:35.400
-Oh, you bitches!
-(horn honking)

16:35.433 --> 16:37.672
-You fucking bitches!
-I fucking warned you!

16:37.705 --> 16:39.107
VICTOR:
You stupid...

16:40.409 --> 16:43.215
Get the fuck out!
You backstabbers!

16:43.248 --> 16:47.624
I tried to help you!
I tried to help you!

16:50.363 --> 16:51.732
Fuck.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.241
Our bags.

16:58.780 --> 17:01.251
Our fucking money.

17:01.284 --> 17:03.624
Fuck!
(moans)

17:03.657 --> 17:05.527
Oh, fuck.

17:08.198 --> 17:10.236
I got a couple bucks.

17:17.618 --> 17:19.288
Well, if one of you were handy,
you could take a look

17:19.321 --> 17:21.258
-at my beer cooler.
-I ain't no maintenance man.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.295
-Geez... Turn it down.
-Shit.

17:24.632 --> 17:26.302
These shitasses.

17:26.335 --> 17:29.374
-Where's your uncle?
-He's a holy man now.

17:29.407 --> 17:32.213
Yeah, right,
and I'm a sex worker in Paris.

17:32.246 --> 17:33.349
Tequila with a little lime,
right?

17:33.382 --> 17:35.253
Yes, you remembered.

17:35.286 --> 17:36.822
And you're still too young,
asshole.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.628
Came to talk to you.

17:40.664 --> 17:42.199
I need you to undo what you did.

17:43.435 --> 17:44.772
What I did?

17:44.805 --> 17:47.310
You mean, what you did.

17:47.343 --> 17:50.617
Come on, man.
Whatever fucking Hogwarts shit

17:50.650 --> 17:52.755
you got up your sleeve's
been causing it for all of us.

17:52.788 --> 17:54.859
That curse came back
and it's frickin' biting

17:54.892 --> 17:56.596
all of us in the ass right now.

17:56.629 --> 17:59.468
Well, I can't help that.
That's not my problem.

17:59.502 --> 18:01.372
Quit being cheap.
My bro's all sad panties.

18:01.405 --> 18:04.478
My hair's falling out. Like...

18:04.512 --> 18:06.549
Where's your Gandalf stick
or your wand or some shit?

18:06.582 --> 18:08.587
You need to Uno reverse card
this shit.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.356
I'm just the intercessor.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.460
-The conjurer.
-The shaman.

18:12.494 --> 18:14.264
Yeah.

18:14.297 --> 18:15.466
Do either of y'all have jobs?

18:16.536 --> 18:18.740
-No.
-Job would straighten you out.

18:18.773 --> 18:19.909
You wouldn't be going on and on

18:19.942 --> 18:22.380
talking about curses and shit.

18:22.413 --> 18:23.650
What's your job?

18:23.683 --> 18:25.621
You're looking at it.

18:25.654 --> 18:27.925
-Drinking?
-No. Disability,

18:27.958 --> 18:29.729
shitass.
You need a job.

18:29.762 --> 18:31.599
A real job, you hear me?

18:31.632 --> 18:33.335
All right.

18:33.368 --> 18:34.772
Well, give me back
that hair, then.

18:34.805 --> 18:37.845
I wish I could,
but I don't got it no more.

18:37.878 --> 18:40.884
I don't just keep vials of hair
laying around the house.

18:40.917 --> 18:43.389
Sko, bro.
This wizard's cooked.

18:43.422 --> 18:44.759
Told you.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.732
You're gonna need a more
powerful wizard than me.

18:47.765 --> 18:50.671
Like, level five.

18:50.704 --> 18:52.541
But I heard
most of them are dead.

18:52.574 --> 18:54.177
And a J-O-B wouldn't hurt.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.480
BEAR:
Man, this is a waste of time.

18:55.514 --> 18:56.448
WILLIE JACK:
They sound like my dad.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.801
Yeah, and that's where
I met Bethany.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.337
She was just a wild onion then.

19:07.370 --> 19:09.809
She was the only
white woman there.

19:09.842 --> 19:12.313
Well, that white woman be stupid

19:12.346 --> 19:15.219
if she don't take
this handsome man back.

19:15.252 --> 19:17.625
-AUNTIE B: Dang.
-BUCKY: Mm.
Think she'll like it?

19:17.658 --> 19:19.796
-Hell yes.
-Hey, young bloods.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.699
-Sup?
-Hey.

19:21.732 --> 19:24.371
Hey, cvpon, I know you.
Who's your dad?

19:24.404 --> 19:25.541
AUNTIE B:
Huh? You know his dad.

19:25.574 --> 19:27.210
Used to snag around with him.

19:27.243 --> 19:28.345
Little braids.

19:28.378 --> 19:29.649
DEDE:
Ennit.

19:29.682 --> 19:31.586
Little Braids.

19:31.619 --> 19:34.257
Dang, boy.
I was almost your mama.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.796
Where's he at these days-- jail?

19:36.829 --> 19:38.299
He's in California.

19:38.332 --> 19:40.436
Aw. Just all dadless, ennit?

19:40.469 --> 19:41.973
It's okay.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.777
Your mom will find another one.

19:43.810 --> 19:44.946
AUNTIE B:
What you kids want?

19:44.979 --> 19:46.515
Need a trim, niece?

19:47.518 --> 19:48.687
We need more of Jackie's hair.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.291
You know, for the curse we did?

19:52.260 --> 19:53.563
What you talking about, hair?

19:53.596 --> 19:55.233
I don't be giving out hair.
You crazy?

19:55.266 --> 19:56.903
-You gave us hair last time.
-Hair for a curse.

19:56.936 --> 19:58.507
I don't be giving out hair.

19:58.540 --> 19:59.776
What, you trying
to scare off my customers?

19:59.809 --> 20:00.978
Gol.

20:01.011 --> 20:03.349
But you did.
Gave us some hair.

20:03.382 --> 20:06.021
I believe I will
just sweep up my own hair.

20:06.054 --> 20:08.392
(chuckles)
Ah. Yeah.

20:08.425 --> 20:11.599
You know, if you two
are putting a curse on someone,

20:11.632 --> 20:13.269
take it from me,

20:13.302 --> 20:14.939
that bad medicine
will come back on you hard.

20:14.972 --> 20:16.876
Fuck, I know.

20:16.909 --> 20:19.549
Trying to undo it.
That's why we're here.

20:19.582 --> 20:22.353
But I told you, I don't be
giving out hair for curses.

20:22.386 --> 20:23.990
Go on, acting like I'm a witch.

20:28.065 --> 20:29.968
You good, bro?

20:36.381 --> 20:38.052
Hey.

20:38.085 --> 20:39.421
Here.

20:39.454 --> 20:40.990
Put these in your pocket.

20:42.928 --> 20:44.064
Why?

20:44.097 --> 20:46.669
We're gonna break that curse.

20:46.702 --> 20:49.440
Oh, fuckin' skoden!

20:53.048 --> 20:56.856
You need something
from the person that you cursed.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.662
Something personal. You know,
it doesn't have to be hair.

20:59.695 --> 21:01.566
It could be anything.

21:01.599 --> 21:03.034
Her Auntie Bev's.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.509
She might have something.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.312
Sko there. Fuck.

21:08.345 --> 21:11.051
Okay, then, so, uh,
where's this Auntie Bev's?

21:11.084 --> 21:12.988
Fuck, I don't even know.

21:16.027 --> 21:18.365
She works at IHS.

21:18.398 --> 21:19.969
(exclaims)

21:20.002 --> 21:23.042
(chuckles)
What's wrong with him?

21:23.075 --> 21:24.811
He's got daddy issues.

21:25.847 --> 21:27.885
I ain't got daddy issues.

21:27.918 --> 21:31.525
Hey, we all got daddy issues.

21:36.535 --> 21:38.840
(country music playing faintly)

21:38.873 --> 21:41.745
You stabbed that fool
in the arm.

21:43.415 --> 21:45.052
(chuckles):
Yeah.

21:45.085 --> 21:46.923
I guess I did.

21:46.956 --> 21:49.695
Fucking stabbed him up.

21:52.701 --> 21:54.004
You don't think
he's gonna, like,

21:54.037 --> 21:55.406
die or anything, though, do you?

21:55.439 --> 21:57.878
It was just his arm.

21:57.911 --> 21:59.147
I might've broke
that fucker's jaw.

21:59.180 --> 22:01.117
But I warned him, though.

22:04.892 --> 22:06.563
This catfish is shit.

22:06.596 --> 22:08.533
Yeah.

22:08.566 --> 22:10.904
It's got nothing
on Rob and Cleo's.

22:15.012 --> 22:16.649
Your friend Daniel?

22:19.588 --> 22:22.561
It wasn't that long ago, was it?

22:24.063 --> 22:25.967
About a year ago.

22:28.606 --> 22:30.677
He was cool.

22:31.812 --> 22:33.549
The coolest.

22:38.158 --> 22:39.795
My brother died.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.669
He was cool, too.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.998
Bethany kicked me out again.

22:58.031 --> 22:59.167
Aho.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.004
BUCKY: Aho,
yeah, she's a tough one.

23:01.037 --> 23:02.574
Third time this month.

23:05.045 --> 23:07.016
Try this.

23:07.049 --> 23:08.085
BUCKY:
Huh.

23:08.118 --> 23:09.487
Man Moon.

23:10.690 --> 23:11.893
Ah.

23:11.926 --> 23:14.932
"Am I the problem?"

23:14.965 --> 23:16.835
Mabel Post Oak.

23:17.971 --> 23:19.742
Mabel Post Oak.

23:19.775 --> 23:22.080
(clears throat)

23:22.113 --> 23:24.184
Wow. So, let me
get this straight...

23:24.217 --> 23:27.022
Hold on, hold on.
Bro, Cheese is texting me.

23:34.805 --> 23:37.610
You took her hair.

23:38.746 --> 23:41.586
You got a white wizard
to put a curse on her--

23:41.619 --> 23:45.961
you didn't think it would work,
but it did--

23:45.994 --> 23:50.135
and now you need a hair clip
or something to break the curse.

23:52.073 --> 23:53.208
Yep.

23:53.241 --> 23:55.514
Yeah.

23:55.547 --> 23:56.783
What's your address?

23:56.816 --> 23:58.252
You know what?
Don't even tell me.

23:58.285 --> 24:01.693
I know your mom.
Your dad works here.

24:01.726 --> 24:05.065
I'm gonna refer you
to, uh, drug court.

24:06.101 --> 24:08.005
Hate this place.

24:08.038 --> 24:10.175
Bye.

24:11.979 --> 24:14.585
-Yo, what happened?
-She ain't gonna help us.

24:14.618 --> 24:17.725
(sighs)
Man, Willie Jack.

24:17.758 --> 24:21.131
There's no curse, bro.
It's just kid shit.

24:21.164 --> 24:22.767
Can we go eat some catfish?

24:25.038 --> 24:27.977
Bro, I'd help you
if you did a curse.

24:30.884 --> 24:33.923
-(screaming over TV)
-Mm.

24:33.956 --> 24:36.227
I'm pretty sure there were six
extra frames when he exploded.

24:38.599 --> 24:41.539
Your friends coming
to pick you up?

24:41.572 --> 24:44.277
I don't got no extra seat
on the lawn mower.

24:44.310 --> 24:47.116
Mm, they're almost done.
Bucky's with them.

24:47.149 --> 24:49.588
-Bucky?
-Yeah.

24:49.621 --> 24:51.124
He's real knowledgeable
about this stuff.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.563
He's really smart.
Might even be a wizard himself.

24:53.596 --> 24:55.099
Wh-Where you going?

24:55.132 --> 24:57.203
Turn it off, let's go.

24:57.236 --> 24:59.007
Bucky doesn't know
what he's doing.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.844
He'll make it worse.

25:00.877 --> 25:02.681
CHEESE: I thought you said
you didn't have an extra seat.

String theory explains this.

26:05.807 --> 26:09.782
You know,
every element in our bodies

26:09.815 --> 26:12.921
was made inside
an exploding star.

26:12.954 --> 26:16.896
We just borrow stardust
until we die,

26:16.929 --> 26:20.637
and then we return it
for something else to use.

26:20.670 --> 26:26.047
We're like vibrating strings,
you know, notes of the cosmos,

26:26.080 --> 26:28.987

26:29.020 --> 26:32.761

(laughs softly)
Steal a car?

27:08.966 --> 27:10.670
It's easy.

27:10.703 --> 27:12.708
Most folks leave their keys
in their cars anyways.
