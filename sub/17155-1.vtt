It's so cool that Mom and Dad
let us come here for the whole summer.

02:00.875 --> 02:04.583
Well, yeah, with an eldest brother
this trustworthy, they can actually relax.

02:05.458 --> 02:10.208
So, in this scenario
you're kind of like our LA Dad.

02:10.291 --> 02:12.583
-And Mom.
-Well, Mom, I'm hungry.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.583

Make yourself a sandwich.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.667
Guys, we're free now.

whenever we want.

We can just ask Macy and Stella

02:25.625 --> 02:27.667
to stop somewhere on the way
home from the airport.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.041
Nice, Joe, putting your girlfriend to work
before she even gets here.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.041
She's not my girlfriend yet.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.709
I haven't even seen her
since the tour started.

02:34.792 --> 02:37.667
She does know that you want
to be her boyfriend, right?

02:37.750 --> 02:38.709
Absolutely.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.125
Probably.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.834
Joe, what exactly did you say to her?

02:45.917 --> 02:48.250
I said, "Hey, we're gonna be
in LA the whole summer."

02:48.333 --> 02:50.208
And she was like,
"Oh, cool, I can totally come."

02:50.291 --> 02:51.834
And I was like, "Huh?"
And she was like, "Yeah."

02:51.917 --> 02:55.917
-And I was like, "cool."
-That's even vague in Joe language.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.917
Joe, if you want to be with Stella,
you have to tell her.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.250
-With words.
-That makes sense.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.250
Guys, trust me.
I've got this covered.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.875
When I see her tonight
I'm gonna say it loud and clear.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.959
Stella Malone,
will you be my girlfriend?

03:09.041 --> 03:11.333
-Yes!
-See? Kev likes it.

03:11.417 --> 03:13.250
No, I found the salt.

03:41.458 --> 03:42.917
-Camera off.
-What?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.458
OK, first of all,
what did I tell you about

03:44.542 --> 03:46.583
acting like a crazy Jonas fan person?

03:46.667 --> 03:50.417
-To not to.
-Thank you. And second,

03:50.500 --> 03:52.834
I'm not telling the whole world
about me and Joe.

03:52.917 --> 03:54.667
You're not even telling me
about you and Joe.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.375
Are you guys gonna be
a couple or what?

03:56.458 --> 03:59.709
I don't know.
I mean, it's been two months.

03:59.792 --> 04:01.750
I barely remember what he looks like.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.250
[groans] Darn it.
He's cute.

04:09.333 --> 04:13.291
And by the end of the day
he may just be your boyfriend.

04:13.375 --> 04:14.959
I know.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.625
-Stella Bear.
-Oh, Aunt Lisa!

I live next door.

05:06.959 --> 05:11.250
You see, the haters call me Dennis Zimmer,
but the players call me DZ.

05:11.333 --> 05:15.417
-He brought muffins.
-Let me run them through the lab.

05:16.208 --> 05:19.208

So, when's the party, guys?

05:19.291 --> 05:21.875
-What party?
-He's messing with me, right?

05:22.750 --> 05:24.417
Let me break it down for you, OK, guys?

05:24.500 --> 05:28.417
In LA, if you don't throw a party,
you don't get invited to the parties, OK?

05:28.500 --> 05:31.959
Then the paparazzi forget you.
Then the media forget you.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.542
Then the fans forget you.

05:34.583 --> 05:35.792
How do you know so much about this?

05:35.875 --> 05:38.625
I watch a lot of
"So, where are they now?" shows.

05:38.709 --> 05:40.417
Actually, I think this sneezy guy
might have a point.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.792
It's DZ, but <i>gracias.</i>

05:43.959 --> 05:47.333
Look, if that's the way this town works,
then I say bring it.

05:47.458 --> 05:48.917
We're known for our parties,
am I right?

05:49.000 --> 05:49.959
[Joe] Yeah.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.959
I thought we were known
for smelling super good,

05:52.041 --> 05:53.458
or is that just me?

05:54.792 --> 05:56.667

I'm your chaperone this summer,

06:37.333 --> 06:39.625
but remember I'm the cool aunt, OK?

06:39.709 --> 06:41.417
You can tell me anything.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.125
Stella's gonna date Joe from Jonas.

What?
I'm calling your mom.

-I thought you were the cool aunt.

06:47.792 --> 06:50.875
Yeah, hi.
Not when it comes to dating rock stars.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.500

06:55.000 --> 06:56.875
OK, 12 times.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.875
No, Joe's different.

since we were little kids.

He's funny.
And he's sweet and smart.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.375
Yeah, and he's still a rock star.

there's always gonna be another girl,

to our new best friend.

11:24.750 --> 11:29.000
Oh, I was hoping, but I never expected...

11:29.625 --> 11:32.083
You're talking about the car. Cool.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.792
You bought a car?

11:33.875 --> 11:35.917
Not just any car.
This baby is a fully modified,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.375
retrofitted biodiesel cruising machine.

11:38.458 --> 11:39.709
And it runs on cooking oil.

11:39.792 --> 11:42.875
Kevin, you were in charge of music.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.208
[engine revs]

11:47.333 --> 11:48.750
Sounds like a sweet symphony to me.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.250
[sniffing]
Smells like a side of French fries.

11:51.333 --> 11:54.000
I've been busting my butt all day
trying to get this party together,

11:54.083 --> 11:56.166
and your contribution
is buying yourself a car?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.166
It's not just for me.
It's for all of us.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.166
And it even can fit Stella and Macy.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.125
Yeah, if they ever get here.

12:02.417 --> 12:05.250
-Can I drive?
-No.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.208
-Play it again.
-[Joe] <i>Hey, Stell.</i>

12:15.291 --> 12:16.291
OK, stop.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.959
He called you Stell.
It's a cute nickname. It's affectionate.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.750
My rocker had a nickname for me too,
mm-hmm...

12:22.834 --> 12:27.500
Lis, as in, "Hey, Lis, it's over.
Can I get my cat back?"

12:28.041 --> 12:30.875
But, no, he could not get you back,
could he, Barnaby?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.750
[Barnaby mews]

12:32.959 --> 12:33.875
Keep going.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.834
-[Joe] <i>Hope you landed OK.</i>
-Stop.

12:37.583 --> 12:40.834
He's aware of your itinerary.
And he cares about your safety.

12:41.542 --> 12:42.625
More.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.625
[Joe]
<i>Anyway, we're throwing a party tonight.</i>

12:44.709 --> 12:45.542
Stop.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.208
OK, big question... who is "we"?

12:48.291 --> 12:50.041
Is it "we" as in him and his brothers

12:50.125 --> 12:53.417
-or "we" as in him and--
-The Laker Girls? Yeah.

12:54.792 --> 12:56.208
Let's roll.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.083
OK, can I say something?

12:59.166 --> 13:01.709
Joe called and said
he can't wait to see you.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.417
So let's go to Aunt Lisa's,
get super pretty

13:04.500 --> 13:05.834
and go blow up the party.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.709
-What do you say?
-[breathes deeply] I say, yes.

13:09.959 --> 13:13.000
And you know what? When I see Joe,
everything will just be clear.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
Exactly.
OK.

13:15.583 --> 13:19.542
Um, hi, hello.
Yeah, I'm gonna need a push over here.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.709
So, like, put your back into it.

13:23.959 --> 13:24.917
Thanks.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.083
[pop music playing]

13:36.208 --> 13:37.750
Emma, you made it.

13:37.834 --> 13:40.208
Nice party, guys.
Way to show up in style.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.166
Ah, it's just a little something
we threw together.

13:42.250 --> 13:45.166
One thing about the guy
who called to invite me...

13:45.250 --> 13:50.375
kind of cheesy, kind of desperate,
kept calling me babe.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.959
-That's so not cool.
-I know it was you.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.750
Yeah, probably 'cause I said
my name, right?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.542
That was the tip-off.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.375
Don't worry.
It was cute.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.709
Um, Emma Roberts is at our party.
You're welcome.

14:04.792 --> 14:05.792
[chuckles]

14:06.792 --> 14:08.041
Guys.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.166
Remember, use your words.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.250
[mumbles]

14:27.041 --> 14:29.875
There you are. Good news,
I told my director that I met you

14:29.959 --> 14:32.041
and she flipped. She's a huge fan.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.250
-That's awesome.
-I know. She wants to set up a meeting

14:34.333 --> 14:36.125
because she has a part for you
in <i>Forever April.</i>

14:36.208 --> 14:38.458
Are you serious?
That's amazing.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.375
I know.
We might work together. Yay!

14:40.417 --> 14:41.458
Yay!

14:46.500 --> 14:48.291
Oh, no.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.375
Oh, I just love this.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.208
I mean, some people think
my mom pushed me into acting,

14:55.291 --> 14:57.959
but really I was like,
"Mom, I know I'm only four,

14:58.041 --> 14:59.500
but I just know," you know?

14:59.583 --> 15:00.792
I'll be right back.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.291
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:04.375 --> 15:05.542
You look amazing.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.083
Thanks.
I like your shirt.

15:10.834 --> 15:13.083
[both]
I have something I want to tell you.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.542
-You go first.
-OK.

15:15.625 --> 15:18.458
Um, I want to be friends.

15:19.625 --> 15:20.792
We are friends.

15:21.750 --> 15:24.458
No, just friends.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.542
I should have gone first.

15:31.709 --> 15:32.667
Why?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.125
Joe, we had this amazing moment together,

15:35.208 --> 15:38.667
and then you left, for two months,

15:38.750 --> 15:42.625
to be a rock star, which is fine,
because that's what you are.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.125
What does that have to do with us?

15:46.375 --> 15:47.458
Come here.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.625
I can't believe we're here.

15:52.709 --> 15:54.500
-Welcome to LA
-Want to see the guest house?

15:54.583 --> 15:56.041
-Oh, OK.
-Come on, it's this way.

16:01.083 --> 16:04.000
Wow, Stella is gonna love this.

16:04.083 --> 16:05.542
Oh, yeah, Stella.
How do you think it's going?

16:05.625 --> 16:07.208
Yeah, give us your girl take.

16:07.291 --> 16:11.417
-One word: drama.
-Wait, good drama or bad drama?

16:11.542 --> 16:14.125
Drama with a surprise guest, Vanessa Page.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.709
[chuckles]
Wait, Vanessa Page is at our party?

16:16.792 --> 16:18.083
Good job, Nick.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.250
I didn't invite her,
but I'll take the credit.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.458
We should probably get back in there.

16:22.542 --> 16:24.458
But pretend like
you don't know anything.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.709
But I don't know anything.

16:28.875 --> 16:32.417
[sighs]
Joe, we live in different worlds.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.417
I mean, you're here five minutes,
and you're already hugging Vanessa Page.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.083
She hugged me.
She's a very aggressive hugger.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.333
That's not even the point.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.250
The point is
how our relationship makes me feel.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.041
And if we try to date this summer...

16:47.959 --> 16:49.166
You haven't met my Aunt Lisa,

16:49.250 --> 16:51.250
but I really don't want to
have to steal your cat.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.959
What are you talking about?

16:53.208 --> 16:55.542
Are you breaking up with me?

16:55.917 --> 16:59.750
It's not a breakup
because we never really dated.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.083
Then what is this?

17:02.667 --> 17:05.500
Let's call it
a friendship confirmation.

17:07.375 --> 17:10.458
-It's a good thing.
-Doesn't feel like it.

17:10.542 --> 17:15.875
Joe, listen to me.
This changes nothing.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.875
This place is amazing.

17:17.959 --> 17:22.125
We're all together in LA:
Kevin, Nick, Macy.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.000
Sup?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.166
Who is this guy?

17:26.250 --> 17:29.500
-He kind of came with the house.
-So, how is it going, guys?

17:30.458 --> 17:31.875
Great.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.750
We're friends.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.917
-[Kevin] Friends?
-Friends.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.250
-Friends.
-They're friends.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.667
Got it.
So, I have a question:

17:42.750 --> 17:45.417
Does anybody really know
anyone at this party?

17:45.959 --> 17:47.041
No.

17:47.792 --> 17:49.166
I say we get out of here.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.500
Whoa, wait.
You guys are tripping, OK?

17:51.583 --> 17:52.792
You can't just leave your own party.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.667
-It's your party now, buddy.
-Really?

17:56.917 --> 17:59.625
Hey, big shot, use a coaster!

17:59.709 --> 18:01.291
[laughs]

18:01.375 --> 18:05.542
So, anybody want to show
a couple of Jersey girls the town?

18:05.625 --> 18:07.834
My car's got a full tank of bacon grease.
Let's do it.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.250
Let's go.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.375
So, Joe and Stella, not happening?

18:13.458 --> 18:15.792
Well, the summer's still young.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.625
It's really good to see you.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.792
It's good to see you, too.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.083
-We should...
-Yeah, OK.

18:33.834 --> 18:34.834
[horn honks]

18:44.583 --> 18:45.792
Don't be late.

Macy here again.

20:19.917 --> 20:23.875
We are at the Crib de la Jonas,
which is really bad Spanish,

20:23.959 --> 20:26.542
but it's still a pretty cool place.
Let's check in with the guys

20:26.625 --> 20:28.125
and see what they have
planned this summer.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.583
So, Kevin, what's up?

20:30.667 --> 20:33.041
Oh, hey.
Just feeding my baby.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.333
Found out bacon grease made her backfire.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.250
But what she really loves is Chinese.

20:37.333 --> 20:40.041
So big shout to all my friends
over at Hunan Lotus.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.041
Thanks for sending over
that old peanut oil.

20:42.125 --> 20:45.125
Oh, and keep frying up
those greasy egg rolls.

20:46.500 --> 20:50.417
This book's got it all:
it's got adventure, romance.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.542
The cover's pretty cool.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.875
And the movie's starring Vanessa Page,

20:55.750 --> 20:57.959
although she told me
to keep that totes hush-hush.

20:58.834 --> 21:01.166
[Macy]
You realize this is going out on the web?

21:02.250 --> 21:03.667
Can we do that over?

21:04.333 --> 21:06.083
[Macy] So, what's going on?

21:06.166 --> 21:09.166
Say, hello, to our new summer roomie.

21:09.291 --> 21:12.667
Hi. I spoke to Stella's mom,
and we decided

21:12.750 --> 21:16.875
the best way to chaperone these girls
was up close and personal. Mmm...

21:16.959 --> 21:18.417
Awesome.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.291
Thanks, Mom.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.375
-[Macy] Nick.
-Hey, what's up?

21:24.458 --> 21:27.291
[Macy] Uh, just doing a video blog
about what the band is up to this summer.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.875
Just working on
a California-inspired song.

21:29.959 --> 21:31.834
[Macy]
Oh, can you give the fans a preview?

21:31.917 --> 21:33.083
[plays one note]

21:33.166 --> 21:35.083
We've only been here one day.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.333
Yo, what's up, people?
DZ, here.

21:37.375 --> 21:40.750
And, uh, this summer I plan
to spend 24/7 with Jonas.

21:40.834 --> 21:44.041
I mean, if the days were longer,
we'd probably spend 25/8, right?

21:44.125 --> 21:45.166
It's just me.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.125
-You got my muffins?
-No.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.500
Goodbye.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.750
OK, well, that was
the behind-the-scenes look.

21:51.834 --> 21:55.250
Macy Misa is saying
welcome to a summer like no other.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.166
[chuckles]

21:56.667 --> 21:58.417
[Kevin] <i>Next on Jonas...</i>

21:58.500 --> 22:00.667
Well, I talked to my director
about who should play

22:00.750 --> 22:02.166
my love interest in <i>Forever April,</i>

22:02.250 --> 22:04.750
and she wants a Joe from Jonas type.

22:04.834 --> 22:06.625
You've never done this before.
You should prepare.

22:06.709 --> 22:07.750
It's all about my look.

22:07.834 --> 22:09.917
<i>Vanessa said the whole</i>
<i>audition's a formality.</i>

22:10.000 --> 22:11.875
[sighs]
This one looks all wrong.

22:12.208 --> 22:15.375
-Nick from Jonas.
-Stone from the ocean.

22:15.458 --> 22:17.542
Wait, do that again.
I want to get this for the site.

22:17.625 --> 22:20.625
Maybe I could interest you
in a position as my web tech.

22:20.709 --> 22:22.125
Yeah, she's gonna pass.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.417
You know what?
You don't get to decide things for me.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.625
I quit.
