01:24.352 --> 01:28.189
Aloha, Mrs. J. How do I look?

01:28.256 --> 01:30.491
Mmm. Like Don Ho.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.726
Don who?
Ho.

01:32.793 --> 01:36.697
Oh. Ho, ho.
I'm going to a luau tonight.

01:36.764 --> 01:40.134
Oh, George and I went
to a luau once
and he got into a fight.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.235
A fight?

01:41.302 --> 01:44.405
Yeah. A waiter came up
to him and said, "poi?"

01:44.472 --> 01:47.141
And George said,
"Who're you calling boy?"

01:48.642 --> 01:50.077
And then he hit him.

01:50.144 --> 01:54.415
Ah, gave him a nice
Hawaiian punch, eh?

01:54.482 --> 01:58.051
You know, like
on the television.
A nice Hawaiian...

02:00.621 --> 02:02.423
Did you like the hula dancing?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.657
Oh, yes.
Yes.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.825
* A lovely hula

02:04.892 --> 02:06.894
Oh, come on, Mrs. J, dance.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.999
* Lovely hula hands

Hi, George.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.547
Aloha, Mr. J. Aloha.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.817
-Say what?
-Aloha. It means "hello"
in Hawaiian.

02:29.883 --> 02:33.287
-Oh.
-Strangely enough,
it also means goodbye.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.355
Is that right?

02:34.422 --> 02:35.356
Yes. Isn't that fascinating?

02:35.423 --> 02:37.090
Yes, and aloha.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.263
George, that wasn't very nice.
Why do you always do that?

02:42.330 --> 02:45.266
Look, Weezy, I want Bentley
outta here. I'm expecting
somebody any minute.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.734
Who?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.869
Bill Jessup's stockbroker.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.172
Bill Jessup? Isn't that
your friend who lost his job
six months ago?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.241
Yep.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.275
How is the poor man?

02:54.342 --> 02:56.076
The poor man is rich.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.078
What?

02:58.145 --> 03:00.881
That's right. I bumped into
Jessup today. He's making a
fortune in the stock market.

03:00.948 --> 03:04.685
He is? Well, your stocks
have all been losing money.

03:04.752 --> 03:09.823
That's because my broker
is Fred Hammerman.
When he talks, nobody listens.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.894
That's why I'm meeting
with Bill Jessup's man today.
His name is, uh, Roy Crandall.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.564
Well, what makes you think
this Roy Crandall
will do better?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.032
Well, he's a one-man
operation. He can play
his hunches.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.168
That's how you make
a fortune overnight.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.537
It could also be a way
to lose one.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.473
Oh, Weez... Flor!

03:25.539 --> 03:27.275
She went to the store.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.244
Damn! I wanted her to make
some hors d'oeuvres
for Roy Crandall.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.146
Uh, George, don't you think
you're taking a risk?

03:33.213 --> 03:36.350
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Florence's food might
kill the poor guy.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.289
No, I mean about changing
stockbrokers.

03:41.355 --> 03:44.458
Look, Weezy, you've got
to gamble in life.
You know that.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.261
I sure do.
I married you, didn't I?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.331
Ohhh!

04:01.375 --> 04:02.543
Hey, Foxy Mama.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.348
Don't get fresh with me,
turkey.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.916
That wasn't me, miss.
That was J.P.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.418
And who's J.P.?

04:10.484 --> 04:11.985
I thought you'd never ask.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.289
Hey, are you a ventriloquist?

04:15.356 --> 04:18.191
That's right. J.P.,
tell the lady you're sorry.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.595
Only thing I'm sorry about
is I'm not sitting on her arm.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.633
You know, I got a cousin
that lives in this building.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.436
-You have?
-Yeah, he's a coffee table
in 4C.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.005
Ohh!

04:33.707 --> 04:35.576
How do you like that?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.678
Oh, he loves it.
He's not used to pretty women
falling all over him.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.383
No, I mean this elevator.
The darn thing's stuck.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.819
No sweat, toots. My friend
will have it fixed in no time.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.889
-Push that start button,
man.
-Why me?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.858
Cause your arm is longer
than mine.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.965
It's not moving.
What'll we do now?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.233
What any sensible person
would do.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.536
Panic! Help! Help!

05:02.603 --> 05:04.805
Quiet!

05:04.872 --> 05:05.939
(WHISPERING) Help!

05:09.443 --> 05:11.745
Oh, it's moving.
Thank the Lord.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.548
Oh, shoot, I was hoping
I'd get to spend
some time with you.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.085
Well, this is my floor.
See ya.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.390
Hey, where're you going?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.558
Looks like you're going
to the same place we're going.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.259
Are you George Jefferson's
wife?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.696
Now, I got a lot of problems,
but that ain't one of them.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.835
My name is Roy Crandall.
I'm here to see
George Jefferson.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.137
My name is Florence and
that sure ain't why I'm here.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.877
Come on in.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.451
(DOOR SHUTS)
Mr. Jefferson?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.754
Hey, Florence, do me a favor.
I got...

05:53.821 --> 05:57.290
Hey, who's the guy
with the dummy?

05:57.357 --> 05:59.727
Watch what you say about
my friend. He's smarter
than he looks.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.296
Mr. Jefferson,
I'm Roy Crandall.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.699
Oh, you're the stockbroker?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.668
That's a matter of opinion.

06:07.735 --> 06:11.138
Keep talking like that,
I'm gonna put termites
in your pockets.

06:11.204 --> 06:15.275
Hey, Weezy, come here. This is
Roy Crandall, the stockbroker
I've been telling you about.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.645
Real pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Jefferson.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.447
Yeah, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.750
Pleased to meet you, uh, both.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.954
He's gonna help us make
a lot of money,
right, Crandall?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.823
Don't bet on it. He dropped
a bundle in the market
the other day.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.559
He did?
Yeah, his shopping bag broke.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.494
(GEORGE CHUCKLES)

06:33.561 --> 06:35.463
Hey, Crandall,
why don't you have a seat.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.165
Oh, don't bother pulling up
a chair for me.
I'll just sit on his knee.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.235
I gotta give it to you,
Crandall. You're the first
stockbroker I have met

06:42.302 --> 06:45.539
that carries a dum... I mean,
a friend around with him
on business calls.

06:45.606 --> 06:49.376
That's the whole point,
Mr. Jefferson. J.P. here
is a great asset to me.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.678
Yeah, I do all the thinking
for him.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.613
(GEORGE LAUGHS)

06:52.680 --> 06:54.482
-Actually, he's a big
promotional help.
-GEORGE: Uh-huh.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.350
He sure is. People ain't about
to forget something
like you two.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.488
You mean you take your friend
with you everywhere you go?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.389
I have to.
He's got the driver's license.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.259
Yeah, but you have other
talents, J.P.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.428
Why don't you sing
something for our friends?

07:08.496 --> 07:10.197
How's it go?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.331
How does what go?

07:11.398 --> 07:12.399
"Something For Our Friends."

07:15.002 --> 07:19.540
-Look, I'll do the rhythm,
you do the lyrics. Ready?
-Ready!

07:19.607 --> 07:20.608
Okay.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.578
* Ham bone, ham bone,
have you heard?

07:26.179 --> 07:29.717
* Papa gonna buy me
a mockingbird

07:29.783 --> 07:32.285
* Now if that mockingbird
don't sing

07:33.453 --> 07:35.923
* Papa gonna buy me
a diamond ring

07:37.224 --> 07:39.392
* Now if that diamond ring
don't shine

07:41.028 --> 07:43.230
* Papa gonna take me
to the five and dime

07:44.565 --> 07:46.834
* Ham bone, ham bone,
where you been?

07:48.301 --> 07:51.905
* Round the world
and I'm going again

07:51.972 --> 07:55.643
* Now what you gonna do
when you get back?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.410
* Gonna take a little walk
Gonna take a little walk

07:57.477 --> 08:00.714
* Gonna take a little walk
to the railroad track *

08:10.157 --> 08:13.894
Oh, that's wonderful.
He's just like a real person.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.328
Yeah, he fools
a lot of people.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.933
Hey, man, how come you
ain't in show business?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.704
I was. But playing
one night stands just
didn't put food on the table.

08:23.771 --> 08:28.441
Right on. I lost so much
weight, I looked like a number
two pencil with glasses.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.979
But you're really good.

08:32.045 --> 08:35.448
He should be. I taught
him everything he knows.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.452
We stuck at it for a while,
but now J.P. and I we just,
we just do it for fun.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.423
It's amazing how you can talk
without opening your mouth,
Mr. Crandall.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.659
Big deal. I can talk
with my mouth closed.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.661
See? Mouth ain't moving a bit.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.802
Man, I wish I could talk
with my mouth shut.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.970
I wish you could do anything
with your mouth shut.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.040
Florence, ain't you got
something to do?

09:00.107 --> 09:02.309
-Like what?
-Like putting those
groceries away!

09:02.375 --> 09:04.144
Me and Mr. Crandall
gotta talk business.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.615
-Come on, Florence,
I'll help you.
-Thank you, Miss Jefferson.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.822
I'll get the door for you.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.925
Now let's talk turkey.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.027
Who you calling turkey?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.596
No, no, no. That's
a figure of speech, J.P.
Don't you know anything?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.698
Ain't my fault you're too
cheap to buy me a brain.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.102
Man, Crandall, it's gonna be
great doing business with you.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.805
Look, Mr. Jefferson, before
we decide to talk business,

09:31.872 --> 09:34.642
-I want you to know
my investment philosophy.
-Oh.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.343
Want me to tell him?

09:36.409 --> 09:37.444
Do you know?

09:37.510 --> 09:39.479
Do you know?

09:39.546 --> 09:41.214
Yeah, I know.
Then I know, dummy.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.454
So what he's gonna tell you
is the stock market is
in a stable.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.723
That's unstable, J.P.,
not "in a stable."

09:49.790 --> 09:54.762
Oh, that's good. 'Cause
if the market was in a stable,
we might get our shoes dirty.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.931
See, Mr. Jefferson,
the list of securities
are very shaky right now.

09:57.998 --> 10:03.103
Over-the-counter stocks
are your best bet. High risk,
with a potential high return.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.972
Now you're talking
my language.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.574
Yeah, he always talks
my language.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.209
I just want you to know
what to expect.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.779
Oh, I know what to expect,
money. Just like
Bill Jessup, right?

10:11.845 --> 10:16.449
Yep. I handled all of
his investments and today he's
worth $1 million.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.151
(GEORGE WHISTLES)

10:18.218 --> 10:21.088
Of course, when he first
came to you, he was worth
$10 million.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.292
Crandall, I like your style.
(CHUCKLES)

10:25.358 --> 10:27.928
I pick out his clothes.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.697
As long as you're willing to
trust me, Mr. Jefferson,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.699
I think everything
will work out nicely.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.969
Trust you? I trust you
so much, I'm gonna put
my money where my mouth is.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.971
Nobody's got a roll that big.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.575
Here you go.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.645
-$5,000, huh?
-Well, you know,
that's just a little starter.

10:45.713 --> 10:49.549
Invest in anything you want,
as long as it brings
those quick returns.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.584
Quick returns?
How about yo-yos?

10:53.220 --> 10:55.923
Yo-yos? That's funny.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.490
Yeah, I got a million of them,
pretty lady.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.459
-If you wanna hear more,
how 'bout dinner tonight?

11:00.493 --> 11:01.929
Well...

11:01.995 --> 11:05.532
Oh, come on. My friend would
ask you, but he's too shy.

11:05.598 --> 11:09.536
Well, in that case,
I'd love to,
but only if you're good.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.039
Oh, he'll be good. Or else.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.273
Or else what?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.008
Or else he'll make
firewood out of me.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.178
Pick you up around 6:00,
Florence?

11:18.245 --> 11:19.579
Good. I'll be ready.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.381
We better get going.
Yeah, I'll go with you.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.150
See you later, Mrs. Jefferson.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.988
Goodbye, Mr. Crandall.
Bye, J.P.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.322
Bye, Mrs. Jefferson.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.392
Maybe we oughta invest that
5 grand in space ships.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.693
Space ships?

11:33.761 --> 11:34.962
Yeah. They're bound to go up.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.339
Isn't that Mr. Crandall
something?

11:46.406 --> 11:49.176
-Yeah, he's a sharp dude,
all right. Just what
I've been looking for.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.945
He makes you feel like J.P.
is a real person.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.748
You know something?
Carrying that dummy around
with him is a good gimmick.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.584
Who are you calling?

11:57.650 --> 12:01.354
Fred Hammerman, my old
stockbroker. I just want
him to... Hammerman?

12:01.421 --> 12:04.491
Yeah, George Jefferson. Okay.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.095
Uh, listen, you and me
ain't gonna be doing business
together anymore.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.297
Well, I just made up my mind.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.033
Yeah, just take all my stocks
and have them transferred over
to Roy Crandall.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.803
Yeah, that's right. Crandall.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.204
Oh, you know him?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.139
He's laughing.

12:20.707 --> 12:21.708
Huh?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.578
You're jiving!

12:25.645 --> 12:27.614
No, I don't think it's funny!

12:28.581 --> 12:30.517
What's wrong, George?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.920
Hammerman tells me that
Crandall ain't playing
with a full deck.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.055
He spent a year
in a nut house.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.890
You mean he was in a
mental hospital?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.926
That's right. Damn!

12:38.992 --> 12:41.494
I should have known anybody
that carries a dummy around
with them has got to be nuts.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.064
Well, where're you going?

12:44.131 --> 12:45.598
I'm going to the bank to stop
payment on that check

12:45.665 --> 12:47.534
before Crandall gives it
to the Easter Bunny.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.971
But, George, you just got
through saying you were
with Mr. Crandall all the way.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.574
Yeah, I was. All the way until
I found out he was a cuckoo
flying over the nest.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.560
Weezy, did Crandall call?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.495
No. Why?

13:15.562 --> 13:18.165
I left a message on his
answering service that I'd
stopped payment on the check,

13:18.231 --> 13:19.632
so if he calls...

13:19.699 --> 13:21.068
If he calls, you talk to him.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.970
I have to leave for a meeting
at the Help Center.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.672
Oh, Weezy, ain't no telling
what a guy like that's
gonna do.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.908
I just hope he don't get mad
and fly off the handle.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.844
George, you're the one
who's flying off the handle.

13:30.911 --> 13:31.945
Say what?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.780
You're over-reacting.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.316
Over-reacting? Weezy,
the guy was definitely
in the funny farm.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.585
I spent two hours finding out
for sure.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.921
You mean you went around
spying on him?

13:40.988 --> 13:44.424
Yeah. And it wasn't easy.
People don't wanna get up off
of that kind of information.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.860
Of course not.
It's none of your business!

13:46.927 --> 13:50.463
It is my business! That nut
could've cost me a fortune!

13:50.530 --> 13:53.766
George, do you really think
it's right not to do business
with a person

13:53.833 --> 13:56.003
just because he's had
an emotional problem?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.471
Emotional problem, Weezy!

13:58.538 --> 14:01.574
We are talking about a dude
who was in a mental home.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.844
But if he's out now,
he's probably perfectly sane.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.514
Perfectly sane? Now how many
perfectly sane people
do you know

14:07.580 --> 14:09.382
that spend all their time
with a dummy?

14:09.449 --> 14:10.850
Besides me?

14:11.919 --> 14:13.954
Weezy. Come on, Weezy,
be serious.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.925
Look, George, you were in
reform school once. Does that
mean you're still a criminal?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.726
Look, Weezy, that's different.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.895
Being in reform school
ain't got nothing to do
with having no brain.

14:21.962 --> 14:25.132
You are so right.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.701
You know what I mean. I mean,
being in a reform school ain't
like being in a loony bin.

14:28.768 --> 14:32.639
Yeah, I know what you mean,
George. Once a nut,
always a nut. Right?

14:32.705 --> 14:35.708
Right. Speaking of nuts,
where's Florence?

14:37.911 --> 14:39.779
She's at the beauty parlor.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.382
Oh, the beauty parlor?
Well, I guess we won't see her
for about two months.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.757
She's getting her hair done
for her date
with Mr. Crandall.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.426
A date with Crandall?
You mean to tell me she's
still gonna go out with him?

14:53.493 --> 14:55.328
Of course she is.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.197
-Well, Weezy, didn't you tell
her the guy's out of his...
-George!

14:57.264 --> 14:59.967
Florence met Mr. Crandall
and she likes him.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.436
Why should I slander the man
by telling Florence
about his past?

15:03.503 --> 15:07.274
Because that psycho's past
could mess up
Florence's future!

15:07.340 --> 15:09.576
-George, you're being
ridiculous.
-Weezy...

15:11.511 --> 15:14.314
Oh, Florence,
your hair looks terrific.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.882
Oh, thank you, Miss Jefferson.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.118
Yeah. You don't look like
your normal self at all.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.654
I sure hope Roy likes it.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.756
Look, Florence, about
this Roy. Weezy ain't gonna...

15:23.823 --> 15:27.160
Uh, George,
mind your own business.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.763
You know, I never met
anybody like him before.
He sure is crazy.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.502
He sure is.

15:35.568 --> 15:39.706
Well, Florence, enjoy yourself
with Mr. Crandall.
I have to go to my meeting.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.275
Look, Weezy, if you
ain't gonna tell her, I will.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.477
Tell me what?

15:44.544 --> 15:48.415
-George decided not to do
business with Mr. Crandall.
-Why?

15:48.481 --> 15:53.353
Because George Jefferson
don't do no business
with no village idiot.

15:53.420 --> 15:57.024
George found out that
Mr. Crandall spent some time
in a mental hospital.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.760
Mental hospital? You mean
I spent all afternoon getting
my hair set for a crazy man?

16:04.531 --> 16:08.168
Florence, that's not fair.
Mr. Crandall's not crazy.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.969
Then what was he doing
on the funny farm?

16:10.037 --> 16:11.238
(KNOCKING)

16:12.272 --> 16:13.540
Somebody's at the door.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.841
Sounds like a woodpecker.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.911
Uh-oh, it's the cuckoo bird.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.050
Mr. Crandall, come in.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.851
Hi, folks.
Hi.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.289
I was just leaving.
Hope to see you later.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.591
J.P.: Me too.
ROY: Bye, Mrs. Jefferson.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.796
Wow! Check that foxy hairdo.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.731
Florence, you look great.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.967
-Thanks.
-Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
I got your message.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.070
Oh, yeah?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.574
Oh, I hope, uh, you didn't get
mad or nothing.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.043
See, I just figured
I ain't gonna be buying
no stocks for a while.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.979
What made you change
your mind?

16:53.046 --> 16:54.847
Was it my breath?

16:54.914 --> 16:57.850
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I just change my mind
a lot. That's all.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.018
Right, Florence?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.587
Right. He sure does.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.489
Oh, that's too bad.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.126
I was gonna buy you
five hundred shares
of United Worm Ranches.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.028
Worm ranches?

17:09.096 --> 17:10.897
Darn, I'm sorry I missed out
on that.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.436
You mean there are herds
of worms?

17:16.503 --> 17:19.872
Well, they have plots of land
where they raise worms.
It's a booming business.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.408
Oh, sounds like a great idea.

17:21.474 --> 17:24.144
-I ain't never heard of
raising no worms.
-Shh!

17:24.211 --> 17:28.148
You can raise anything.
My partner here can even raise
mashed potatoes.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.517
Mashed potatoes?
Yeah.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.253
-How can I raise
mashed potatoes?
-With a spoon.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.289
Ha, ha. Ha, ha.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.529
What's the matter?
Don't you people like
mashed potatoes?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.064
I think I'm beginning to lose
my appetite.

17:45.132 --> 17:48.000
Maybe you'll get it back
when you find out where
we're going to dinner.

17:48.067 --> 17:52.939
-Yeah, I made reservations
at the Old Chowder Club.
-I wanted to tell her.

17:53.005 --> 17:56.243
Best clam chowder in
the country. It's in Boston.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.510
Boston?

17:57.577 --> 17:58.711
Massachusetts?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.081
I thought we'd fly up there
in my plane.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.316
Your plane?

18:03.383 --> 18:04.851
J.P. here is my co-pilot.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.187
Oh, no, I ain't going up
in no plane with you.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.192
Well, if you don't like
to fly, we can go to dinner
around here somewhere.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.396
Uh, well, well... What
Florence is trying to tell you

18:16.463 --> 18:19.532
is that, uh, she'd rather not
go to dinner with you at all.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.968
Yeah, I'm sorry, I've got
a terrible headache.

18:25.372 --> 18:29.008
J.P., I think something's
wrong here and it's not
your breath.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.911
You mean it's your breath?

18:31.978 --> 18:35.782
Uh, look, I was just thinking,
why don't we all just
say goodbye,

18:35.848 --> 18:40.353
and you and your friend
go out and, uh, take in
a Daffy Duck cartoon.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.754
(ALARM RINGING)
What the hell is that?

18:43.756 --> 18:45.158
LOUISE: Somebody, help!

18:45.225 --> 18:47.194
Weezy, is that you?

18:47.260 --> 18:49.629
I'm stuck between floors,
George.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.631
The elevator's
filling up with smoke.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.667
-Oh. Hey, wait, Weezy,
we'll get you out of there.
-(LOUISE COUGHING)

18:58.004 --> 18:59.472
Is that a burglar alarm?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.974
No, it's a fire alarm.
Oh.

19:02.041 --> 19:06.446
A fire alarm? Oh! Fire!

19:06.513 --> 19:08.915
-Weezy's stuck
in the elevator.
-Oh, Lord!

19:08.981 --> 19:11.050
Oh, the doors won't open.

19:11.117 --> 19:14.354
Because it's closed!
It's broken, fool!

19:14.421 --> 19:17.023
Well, with all this smoke,
somebody better do something.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.525
Yeah, like call
the fire department.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.827
Right. Florence,
call the fire department.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.729
Somebody get a crowbar
and open them doors.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.432
Right. Crowbar. Crandall!
Where did he go?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.600
Just like a nut to lose
his head and run away.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.137
Don't worry, Louise!
I'll get a crowbar!

19:31.204 --> 19:34.741
Don't worry, Mrs. J.
I'm gonna clear away
this smoke for you.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.644
Here you go, Bentley.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.911
A coat rack?

19:38.978 --> 19:40.280
Yeah, a rack.
I couldn't find a crowbar.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.849
-All right, let's go!
-No, not that way,
the other way.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.351
The other way!
No!

19:46.219 --> 19:47.420
What are we doing?

19:47.487 --> 19:48.688
I don't know!

19:48.755 --> 19:50.790
We've gotta get something
to pry open the door.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.858
Okay, right.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.327
(SQUABBLING INCOHERENTLY)

19:57.930 --> 20:00.166
LOUISE: The elevator's filling
up with smoke!

20:00.233 --> 20:03.403
Lie down on the floor
and cover up your mouth!

20:03.470 --> 20:04.471
Right!

20:07.774 --> 20:09.276
Not you! Mrs. Jefferson!

20:09.342 --> 20:10.810
Oh.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.479
Did you call
the fire department.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.981
Yeah, somebody else called
them, too. They're already
on the way.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.417
LOUISE: Oh, please,
do something!
(COUGHS)

20:17.484 --> 20:20.119
It's getting harder
to breathe.
(COUGHING)

20:20.186 --> 20:23.189
Try to breathe as little
as possible, Mrs. J.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.997
Oh Lord, this is
Florence Johnson talking.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.933
I don't know why you let this
happen to Miss Jefferson,
Lord,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.903
but I sure would appreciate
it if you would do something.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.372
And quick! You hear?

20:40.507 --> 20:43.209
We're doing the best
we can, Mrs. J.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.979
We'll get you out, Weezy.
Weezy, you all right?

20:47.046 --> 20:49.982
Damn it, Weezy, answer me!
Weezy!

20:53.185 --> 20:54.721
-George.
-I can't talk to you now,
Weezy.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.155
I'm trying to get you
out of there.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.459
-Weezy!
-Miss Jefferson! You're safe!
Mrs. J!

20:59.526 --> 21:01.328
Mrs. J!
Oh, Miss Jefferson.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.363
Are you all right?

21:03.430 --> 21:04.997
But how'd you get stuck
in there? We were trying
to get you out all this...

21:05.064 --> 21:07.900
Don't worry, folks.
You can go back to
your apartments now.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.237
It's just an electrical short.
We'll have the smoke cleared
out in no time.

21:11.304 --> 21:14.874
Oh, I just wanna thank you
for saving my wife's life.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.511
Oh, don't thank me. Thank him.
He's the one
who kept his head.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.881
Crandall! I thought you split.

21:21.948 --> 21:25.217
I heard Mrs. Jefferson's voice
coming from downstairs, so I
ran down to the next floor.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.454
Why didn't I think of that?

21:27.520 --> 21:30.790
Mr. Crandall yelled through
the doors and told me to push
these little round buttons.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.860
Pick-up rollers. They release
the mechanical interlock.

21:33.926 --> 21:38.565
And then I got the doors open,
I jumped down three feet
and he caught me.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.700
Who do you think you are,
man? Spider-man?

21:43.470 --> 21:46.539
Oh, I say,
what an incredible dummy.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.740
Yeah, I sure am.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.809
Me too.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.712
Well, now that's you're safe,
Mrs. J, I've got to hurry off
to my luau.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.114
Aloha and, uh, toodle pip.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.487
Well, how 'bout us just
going back inside?

22:01.788 --> 22:03.490
(GEORGE SIGHS)

22:03.556 --> 22:07.594
Hey, that was some
quick thinking you did there,
Crandall.

22:07.660 --> 22:12.565
-How'd you know what to do?
-You'd be surprised what
a crazy man like me knows.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.067
Yeah, well...
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
I thought that...

22:15.134 --> 22:17.003
I know what you thought.

22:17.069 --> 22:20.940
You thought since I spent some
time in a mental hospital,
I might still be crazy.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.476
Well, why'd they throw you
in the nut... I mean,
in the hospital, anyway?

22:25.277 --> 22:28.147
Nobody threw me in.
I admitted myself.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.816
I felt I was burning
myself out.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.818
Huh?

22:31.884 --> 22:35.388
Yeah, he was having problems.
Even when I talked to him,
he yelled at me.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.991
When we left show business,
I tried to act the way
normal people do.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.362
And it was driving me crazy.

22:43.430 --> 22:48.501
-What I learned in that
hospital was to be myself.
-Me too.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.169
Well, how come you didn't
tell me when I first met you

22:50.236 --> 22:52.338
that you'd spent time
in a mental hospital?

22:52.405 --> 22:56.275
How come you didn't tell
Mr. Crandall that you'd spent
some time in reform school?

22:56.342 --> 22:58.445
Weezy, will you stop
talking about me being
in reform school?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.379
It's in the past,
it don't matter no more!

23:00.447 --> 23:04.451
You're right, George!
It is in the past,
and it doesn't matter anymore!

23:09.722 --> 23:14.060
Uh, well, uh, Crandall,
I wanna write you
another check,

23:14.126 --> 23:16.295
if, uh, you still wanna do
business with me.

23:16.362 --> 23:19.331
Sure, but you can mail
the check to me tomorrow.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.936
Well, bye y'all.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.005
Well, hey, wait a minute.
What about our dinner date?

23:27.239 --> 23:29.308
You mean you still wanna go?

23:29.375 --> 23:31.778
Yeah, I didn't go to the
hairdresser for nothing. I'm
gonna get my money's worth.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.915
Well, in that case, I'd love
to take you to dinner.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.918
No, you wouldn't.
I'm taking us all to dinner.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.887
Maybe by the time we get back,
the elevator will be fixed.

23:41.454 --> 23:42.455
Knock on wood.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.927
Don't touch me, Jack.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.632
Hey, J.P., why don't you
give me a little more
of that ham bone?

23:52.699 --> 23:54.467
The ham bone? All right.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.936
* Ham bone, ham bone,
Have you heard?

23:58.137 --> 24:00.439
* Papa's gonna buy me
a mockingbird

24:01.774 --> 24:04.076
* Now if that mockingbird
don't sing

24:05.244 --> 24:07.046
* Papa's gonna buy me
a diamond ring

24:08.781 --> 24:10.583
* Now if that diamond ring
don't... *

24:38.678 --> 24:42.915
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.451
* Movin', movin on up
