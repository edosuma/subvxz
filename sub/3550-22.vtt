WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.005
EDDIE ADDED HIS MOTHER
TO HIS LIST OF VICTIMS.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.309
HOW'D IT GO?
 WELL, IT WOULD GO A LOT FASTER

00:08.309 --> 00:10.111
IF WE COULD GET HIS MOTHER
IN HERE.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.183
NOBODY'S SEEN HER FOR DAYS.

00:13.244 --> 00:16.146
BREE SAW A DISTURBING SIDE
OF SAM.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.049
I'M AFRAID OF HIM.

00:18.049 --> 00:20.551
SUSAN ATTACKED
MIKE'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

00:20.551 --> 00:23.554
SO IS THIS EVERYTHING?
 YEP.

00:23.554 --> 00:26.127
GABY GOT THE TRUTH.
 I GOT INVOLVED WITH A BAD GUY.

00:26.127 --> 00:30.131
YOU'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT NICK, ARE YOU?
 NO, DANNY'S FATHER--

00:30.131 --> 00:31.802
A REALLY BAD GUY.
 (engine revs)

00:31.802 --> 00:34.665
(tires screech)
 GRAB WHATEVER YOU CAN STUFF
IN A COUPLE OF BAGS.

00:34.665 --> 00:37.138
NOT WITHOUT YOU.
I'LL SEND DANNY.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.310
AND ANGIE FACED HER WORST FEAR.

00:39.310 --> 00:42.143
ARE YOU GONNA KILL ME?
 CAN WE DISCUSS IT
IN THE MORNING?

00:42.143 --> 00:45.676
AND IF YOU DECIDE TO RUN AWAY,
SAY GOOD-BYE TO NICK,

00:45.676 --> 00:49.180
BECAUSE HE WON'T BE AROUND
MUCH LONGER AFTER YOU'VE GONE.

00:57.588 --> 01:01.832
(Mary Alice) ANGIE BOLEN
WAS HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING.

01:01.832 --> 01:04.694
SHE KEPT DREAMING
ABOUT HER LIFE

01:04.694 --> 01:07.598
AND THE CHOICES SHE HAD MADE.

01:07.598 --> 01:10.070
(speaking inaudibly)

01:10.070 --> 01:16.147
AFTER ALL, IT WAS HER DECISION
TO DROP OUT OF COLLEGE.

01:16.147 --> 01:22.813
IT WAS HER IDEA TO JOIN
A GROUP OF ECO-TERRORISTS.

01:24.685 --> 01:28.819
SHE LET HERSELF FALL IN LOVE...

01:28.819 --> 01:32.693
WITH THEIR CHARISMATIC LEADER.

01:35.826 --> 01:39.700
AND SHE AGREED TO BUILD HIM
A BOMB.

01:42.473 --> 01:47.408
ANGIE KNEW HER CHOICES
HAD BEEN BAD ONES.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.681
HOW ELSE COULD
SHE HAVE ENDED UP HERE...

01:50.681 --> 01:56.116
WITH A MAN SHE DESPISED?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.819
GOOD MORNIN'.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.691
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
SITTIN' THERE?

02:00.691 --> 02:03.554
FOR A WHILE.

02:03.554 --> 02:05.556
I'VE BEEN ADMIRING
YOUR SCAR.

02:05.556 --> 02:09.830
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.464
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

02:13.464 --> 02:16.136
IT'S A SYMBOL
OF WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.339
WE KILLED A GUY.
I'M NOT SO PROUD.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.841
WHAT'S ONE LIFE
COMPARED TO THE PLANET?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.843
WHAT WE DID WAS NOBLE.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.716
TELL THAT TO HIS WIFE.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.522
WHEN DID YOU STOP
LOVING ME?

02:31.522 --> 02:34.885
WAS IT WHILE
WE WERE STILL TOGETHER,

02:34.885 --> 02:38.189
OR WAS IT AFTER NICK
TOOK YOU FROM ME?

02:38.189 --> 02:40.231
MY WRIST HURTS.

02:40.231 --> 02:41.732
UNCUFF ME.

02:41.732 --> 02:43.334
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.340
I NEVER LOVED YOU.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.872
THAT'S A LIE.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.944
IN FACT, I'M THINKIN'
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

02:53.944 --> 02:56.607
THAT YOU STILL DO.

02:56.607 --> 02:58.879
DON'T TOUCH ME.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.712
MAYBE IF WE MADE LOVE,
YOU'D REMEMBER.

03:01.712 --> 03:04.215
WE COULD,
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT

03:04.215 --> 03:06.787
WHEN I VOMIT
INTO YOUR MOUTH.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.620
YOU DO REALIZE
I COULD KILL YOU.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.921
BUT YOU WON'T,

03:10.921 --> 03:13.924
'CAUSE YOU NEED ME
FOR SOMETHIN'.

03:13.924 --> 03:15.566
THAT'S TRUE.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.868
WELL... DON'T JUST
KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.

03:17.868 --> 03:20.971
TELL ME.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.876
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
ANOTHER BOMB.

03:25.876 --> 03:29.510
YOU CAN NEVER MAKE ME
DO THAT.

03:31.412 --> 03:38.789
YES, ANGIE BOLEN HAD MADE A LOT
OF BAD CHOICES IN HER LIFE.

03:38.789 --> 03:43.254
YOU'RE GONNA BE SURPRISED
BY WHAT I CAN MAKE YOU DO.

03:44.895 --> 04:02.543
AND SHE NOW
HAD NO CHOICES LEFT.

04:02.543 --> 04:06.647
DETECTIVE JOHN BOOTH
WAS NOT HAPPY.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.749
YOU SEE,

04:08.749 --> 04:12.883
SOMEONE HAD BEEN KILLING WOMEN
IN THE TOWN OF FAIRVIEW,

04:12.883 --> 04:17.988
AND HE HADN'T A CLUE
AS TO WHO IT WAS.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.760
FOR MONTHS,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.734
HE HAD PORED
OVER AUTOPSY PHOTOS...

04:23.734 --> 04:27.868
READ PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES...

04:27.868 --> 04:31.742
AND INTERVIEWED WITNESSES...

04:31.742 --> 04:34.274
BUT DETECTIVE BOOTH WAS STILL

04:34.274 --> 04:39.049
NO CLOSER
TO FINDING THE KILLER.

04:39.049 --> 04:41.912
UNTIL ONE DAY...

04:41.912 --> 04:44.655
BOOTH SPEAKING.

04:44.655 --> 04:46.757
REALLY?

04:46.757 --> 04:49.660
YEAH. OKAY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

04:49.660 --> 04:51.962
WHAT'S UP?
 SOME KIDS CAME ACROSS
A WOMAN'S BODY

04:51.962 --> 04:53.664
BURIED IN THE WOODS.

04:53.664 --> 04:55.526
STRANGLED?

04:55.526 --> 04:57.027
WE'LL FIND OUT.

04:57.027 --> 04:59.970
FORENSICS IS OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW DIGGING HER UP.

05:05.075 --> 05:07.408
HEY, EDDIE.
WE NEED TO TALK.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.081
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

05:11.081 --> 05:14.415
NO. I WENT TO YOUR HOUSE
TO SEE YOUR MOM.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.918
YOU DID?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.420
WHY?

05:19.420 --> 05:22.423
I WANTED TO ASK HER TO COME
TO THERAPY WITH YOU.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.926
DR. McCARTHY THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.629
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

05:28.629 --> 05:31.632
ACTUALLY, SHE WASN'T THERE.
I DON'T WANT TO WORRY YOU,

05:31.632 --> 05:34.705
BUT HER NEIGHBOR SAID
NO ONE HAS SEEN HER FOR DAYS.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.671
LOOK...

05:40.671 --> 05:43.674
I'M SURE THAT MUST SOUND
LIKE A BIG DEAL TO YOU,

05:43.674 --> 05:46.076
BUT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON
MY WHOLE LIFE.

05:46.076 --> 05:48.048
SHE'S OFF ON ANOTHER BENDER,

05:48.048 --> 05:50.721
AND IN A WEEK OR TWO,

05:50.721 --> 05:52.022
SHE'LL COME BACK,

05:52.022 --> 05:55.125
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.828
SO WE DON'T NEED
TO CALL ANYONE?

05:57.828 --> 06:00.561
YOU THINK SHE'S OKAY?

06:00.561 --> 06:03.934
YEAH. IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE SHE TURNS UP.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.871
(sighs) OKAY,
MY PLANE'S IN AN HOUR.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.704
I WISH YOU WEREN'T GONNA BE
GONE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

06:13.704 --> 06:17.408
THE GIRLS ARE GONNA BE
SO DISAPPOINTED.
 THE COMMISSION ON THIS DEAL
IS WORTH 40 GRAND.

06:17.408 --> 06:19.880
I WILL DRY THEIR TEARS
WITH DOLLAR BILLS.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.883
BON VOYAGE. MM.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.056
AND DON'T WORRY. I'LL HAVE
YOUR FAVORITE DINNER WAITING.

06:26.056 --> 06:27.758
THAT'S OKAY, BABE.

06:27.758 --> 06:30.060
WE CAN JUST GO OUT
TO DINNER AND CELEBRATE.

06:30.060 --> 06:33.063
BUT I MAKE YOU LASAGNA
EVERY YEAR.
 I KNOW.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

06:33.063 --> 06:36.066
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH
ALL THE TROUBLE. THAT'S ALL.

06:38.128 --> 06:40.531
I GOTTA GO.
 HOLD IT!

06:42.002 --> 06:46.406
YOU DO LIKE MY LASAGNA,
DON'T YOU?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.908
SURE, I DO.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.010
LIAR!
 EXCUSE ME?

06:50.010 --> 06:53.714
YOU WERE DOING THAT THING
YOU DO WHEN YOU LIE.
 WHAT THING?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.717
OH, LIKE I'M GONNA TELL YOU.
 I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.419
YOU'VE BEEN EATING
MY LASAGNA FOR 11 YEARS.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.622
(sighs) ACTUALLY,

07:01.622 --> 07:04.625
THE FICUS IN THE DINING ROOM
HAS BEEN EATING IT.
 WHAT?

07:04.625 --> 07:07.498
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
IT'S THRIVING.

07:07.498 --> 07:11.001
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I MAKE GREAT MULCH?
 LOOK, I JUST NEVER WANTED
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

07:11.001 --> 07:14.665
UNTIL TODAY.
 WELL, I'VE GOTTEN OLDER.
MY STOMACH'S GOTTEN WEAKER.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.637
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BABY.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.570
YOU JUST DON'T MAKE IT
THE WAY MAMÃ¡ USED TO.
 THAT'S BECAUSE
YOUR BACKSTABBING MOTHER

07:19.570 --> 07:22.913
DIDN'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO GIVE
ME THE RECIPE BEFORE SHE DIED.

07:22.913 --> 07:25.476
SHE WAS RUN OVER BY A CAR!

07:25.476 --> 07:27.147
WELL, ISN'T THAT CONVENIENT?

07:27.147 --> 07:29.149
LOOK,
LASAGNA'S A TOUGH DISH.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.952
BUT I LOVE YOUR GUACAMOLE.

07:31.952 --> 07:35.025
I BUY THAT AT THE STORE.
 LIKE ONLY YOU CAN.

07:35.025 --> 07:37.227
(scoffs)

07:37.227 --> 07:40.961
SO... FIGURE OUT
MY FINANCIAL MESS YET?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.834
I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
THESE INVOICES FOR THREE DAYS,

07:43.834 --> 07:46.036
AND I'M CONFUSED.

07:46.036 --> 07:49.139
THE PAYMENTS DON'T COVER HALF
OF WHAT YOU'VE BILLED.

07:49.139 --> 07:51.141
WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE
NOT EVERYBODY'S PAID.

07:51.141 --> 07:53.143
WHY NOT?

07:53.143 --> 07:55.205
(scoffs)
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

07:55.205 --> 07:56.907
TIMES ARE TOUGH.

07:56.907 --> 08:00.110
A LOT OF MY CUSTOMERS
ARE STRUGGLING

08:00.110 --> 08:03.884
JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET.
 WISH I KNEW WHAT THAT
WAS LIKE. OH, WAIT. I DO.

08:03.884 --> 08:07.818
THEY'LL PAY WHEN THEY CAN.
 HONEY, I LOVE
THAT I MARRIED A GUY

08:07.818 --> 08:10.861
WHO WANTS TO UNCLOG
THE WORLD'S TOILETS FOR FREE.

08:10.861 --> 08:12.993
(sighs)
 BUT NOW IT'S TIME

08:12.993 --> 08:15.996
THE PEOPLE PAY THE PIPER
FOR THE PIPES.
 (taps table)

08:15.996 --> 08:18.769
IT'S NOT THAT EASY. I'VE KNOWN
THESE PEOPLE FOR YEARS.

08:18.769 --> 08:20.771
I CAN'T JUST GO
SHAKE 'EM DOWN.

08:20.771 --> 08:22.803
(sighs) YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.074
I'LL DO IT.

08:24.074 --> 08:27.738
YOU? HEY...
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

08:27.738 --> 08:31.081
LOOK AT ME. BIG BROWN EYES,
QUIVERING LIPS.

08:31.081 --> 08:33.283
ONCE I TELL THEM
HOW OUR LIFE IS FALLING APART,

08:33.283 --> 08:34.985
TRUST ME, THEY'LL PAY.

08:34.985 --> 08:37.548
NO, SUSAN,
THIS WILL NEVER WORK.

08:37.548 --> 08:40.721
(sighs)

08:40.721 --> 08:43.253
FINE.

08:43.253 --> 08:46.657
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

08:46.657 --> 08:48.659
UH, WE BARELY HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY

08:48.659 --> 08:50.761
TO PAY OUR BILLS
THIS MONTH.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.763
THE INSURANCE IS DUE.

08:52.763 --> 08:54.064
(sniffles)

08:54.064 --> 08:57.067
(voice breaks) AND GOD FORBID
M.J. GET IN AN ACCIDENT.

08:57.067 --> 08:59.539
SUSAN, SWEETIE,
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.312
(normal voice)
STILL DON'T THINK IT'LL WORK?

09:02.312 --> 09:05.315
WOW. YOU'RE SCARY.
 CAN I GO GET OUR MONEY?

09:05.315 --> 09:09.149
BE MY GUEST.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.082
HEY, HEY! LAST YEAR,
WHEN I WANTED TO GO FISHING,

09:12.082 --> 09:15.856
BUT YOU WANTED TO GO SKIING
AND YOU STARTED CRYING--
 I THINK IT'S BEST
WE DON'T DISCUSS THAT

09:15.856 --> 09:18.789
UNTIL WE'RE OUT
OF THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.631
(mouths words)

09:20.631 --> 09:22.232
I'M NOT SCARED OF SAM.

09:22.232 --> 09:25.235
IF YOU'RE AFRAID
TO FIRE HIM, I'LL DO IT.
 NO! I DON'T WANT
TO PROVOKE HIM.

09:25.235 --> 09:27.237
THE MAN IS CLEARLY TROUBLED.

09:27.237 --> 09:30.641
AND THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW VIOLENT HE COULD GET.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.903
WELL, WE'RE NOT INTIMIDATED.
ARE WE, ORSON?

09:32.903 --> 09:34.905
JUST HOW VIOLENT ARE
WE TALKING?

09:34.905 --> 09:37.748
HEY, WE'LL DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO PROTECT MOM.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.050
OKAY. BUT I AM IN A CHAIR.

09:40.050 --> 09:43.053
I DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD
I'D BE IN A FIGHT.

09:43.053 --> 09:45.255
THIS THING TIPS OVER
IN A STIFF WIND.

09:45.255 --> 09:47.788
DON'T WORRY, ORSON.
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.991
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:50.991 --> 09:53.794
DID THAT HURT?
 NO.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.066
WELL, THAT'S ALL I GOT.

09:56.066 --> 09:59.770
YOU DON'T NEED TO FIGHT, ORSON.
YOU'RE MORE OF A STRATEGIST.

09:59.770 --> 10:02.032
O-OKAY, FINE.
WE DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.

10:02.032 --> 10:04.334
WHY DON'T WE HIRE SOMEONE
TO ROUGH HIM UP?

10:04.334 --> 10:06.336
I KNOW A COUPLE EX-MARINES.

10:06.336 --> 10:09.009
HOW DO YOU KNOW ANY--
 DON'T ASK.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.682
HEY, WHAT ABOUT MONEY?
 WHAT ABOUT IT?

10:11.682 --> 10:14.685
WELL, IF WE CAN'T FIRE SAM
OR SCARE HIM AWAY,

10:14.685 --> 10:16.787
MAYBE HE'LL RESPOND
TO CASH.

10:16.787 --> 10:19.750
YES, HE'S ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT HOW HE NEVER HAD ANYTHING

10:19.750 --> 10:22.052
GROWING UP.
 I THINK,
ONE LITTLE SEVERANCE PACKAGE,

10:22.052 --> 10:24.394
AND WE COULD BE RID
OF THIS PROBLEM.

10:24.394 --> 10:26.096
OH, BRILLIANT IDEA,
ORSON.

10:26.096 --> 10:29.129
YOU CALL WRITING A CHECK
"BRILLIANT"?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.631
(thud)

10:31.631 --> 10:33.734
ANYTHING?

10:35.065 --> 10:36.737
SORRY.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.944
MRS. SCAVO?
 YEAH?

10:43.944 --> 10:47.217
I'M DETECTIVE BOOTH. THIS IS
DETECTIVE FURST. CAN WE COME IN?

10:47.217 --> 10:49.980
SURE. WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

10:49.980 --> 10:52.683
DO YOU KNOW
AN IRINA KOSOKOV?

10:52.683 --> 10:54.354
OH, UNFORTUNATELY, YEAH.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.787
AND WHATEVER YOU THINK SHE DID,
SHE DID.

10:56.787 --> 10:58.128
I'M SORRY?

10:58.128 --> 11:00.660
SHE'S A CONNIVING,
MANIPULATIVE LITTLE GRIFTER

11:00.660 --> 11:02.793
WHO PUT MY SON THROUGH HELL.

11:02.793 --> 11:04.194
SHE'S DEAD.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.699
WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

11:08.699 --> 11:10.741
WE FOUND HER BODY
EARLIER TODAY.

11:10.741 --> 11:12.042
SHE WAS MURDERED.

11:12.042 --> 11:13.944
(gasps)

11:13.944 --> 11:15.245
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:15.245 --> 11:18.178
UH... THESE ARE POLICEMEN.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.411
IT'S ABOUT IRINA.
 (chuckles) OH, BOY.
THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

11:21.411 --> 11:24.414
TOM...
 THAT LITTLE BITCH COULDN'T
EVEN GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY

11:24.414 --> 11:26.416
BEFORE SHE...
 (whispers) SHE'S DEAD.

11:26.416 --> 11:30.020
WAS TAKEN FROM US TOO SOON.
 IS YOUR SON PRESTON HOME?

11:30.020 --> 11:32.022
NO, HE'S CAMPING
WITH HIS BROTHER.

11:32.022 --> 11:35.025
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING
BY. HE'S GONNA BE DEVASTATED.

11:35.025 --> 11:37.697
ACTUALLY, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.200
WAIT. YOU DON'T THINK HE HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.203
WE FOUND A LETTER THAT
MS. KOSOKOV HAD WRITTEN TO HIM.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.435
SOUNDS LIKE THINGS ENDED
PRETTY BADLY BETWEEN THEM.

11:45.435 --> 11:48.078
WELL, YEAH,
HE BROKE OFF THE ENGAGEMENT.

11:48.078 --> 11:51.081
BUT HE WOULDN'T DO THAT AND THEN
KILL HER. IT'S AN EXTRA STEP.

11:51.081 --> 11:53.083
WOULDN'T YOU JUST SKIP
THE BREAKUP

11:53.083 --> 11:56.086
AND GET RIGHT TO THE KILLING?
 WHY WON'T YOU STOP TALKING?

11:56.086 --> 12:00.250
I WANT TO, BELIEVE ME.
 JUST GET HIM IN
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

12:00.250 --> 12:04.194
SURE.
I'LL CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.
 THANK YOU.

12:04.194 --> 12:05.495
(door opens)

12:05.495 --> 12:07.197
I'M TELLING YOU,

12:07.197 --> 12:09.499
THERE'S NO WAY PRESTON
COULD HAVE HURT THAT GIRL.

12:09.499 --> 12:12.803
YOU GUYS SHOULD CONCENTRATE
ON FINDING THE REAL KILLER.

12:12.803 --> 12:15.135
OH, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND HIM.

12:35.285 --> 12:37.157
BRINGS BACK MEMORIES, HUH?

12:37.157 --> 12:40.230
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

12:40.230 --> 12:43.163
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO START TODAY.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.295
I'M STILL WAITING
ON ONE MORE PIECE.

12:45.295 --> 12:47.798
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

12:47.798 --> 12:49.800
ANGIE, THERE'S
THIS DEVELOPMENT IN OREGON.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.803
THEY'RE PLANNING TO CLEAR-CUT
4,000 ACRES OF OLD GROWTH.

12:52.803 --> 12:56.506
WE GOTTA STOP THEM.
 AND WHO CARES IF WE KILL A FEW
LOGGERS IN THE PROCESS, RIGHT?

12:56.506 --> 12:58.278
SAVING THE WORLD'S MESSY.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.981
YOU USED TO BE ABLE
TO SEE THAT.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.183
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE NOW?
A FAKE.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.785
WHAT?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.889
YOU'RE A PHONY. THE ONLY CAUSE
YOU EVER BELIEVED IN IS YOU.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.262
I'M TRYING TO SAVE THE PLANET!
 OH, GOD.
YOU STILL HAVE THAT EGO.

13:12.262 --> 13:14.965
I WAS TRYING TO SAVE YOU,
TOO!

13:14.965 --> 13:17.267
OH, WELL, THANKS FOR CARING,
BUT NICK SAVED ME,

13:17.267 --> 13:20.270
AND HE SHOWED ME
WHAT A COWARD YOU REALLY ARE.
 DO YOU REALLY WANNA

13:20.270 --> 13:24.104
START TALKING ABOUT NICK
RIGHT NOW, HUH?!

13:24.104 --> 13:26.236
GOD, HOW DOES IT FEEL,

13:26.236 --> 13:29.840
KNOWING YOU'LL NEVER BE
HALF THE MAN HE IS?

13:29.840 --> 13:33.243
(knock on door)
 (Gabrielle) ANGIE, OPEN UP.
IT'S GABY.

13:33.243 --> 13:35.115
SHE WON'T GO.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.118
I'M NOT GOING. I SEE YOUR CAR.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.253
(lowered voice) YOU'VE GOT
ONE MINUTE TO GET RID OF HER,

13:43.253 --> 13:47.157
OR THERE'S GONNA BE ONE LESS
NEIGHBOR AT THE BLOCK PARTY.

13:47.157 --> 13:48.828
(sighs)

13:48.828 --> 13:50.600
COME ON IN.

13:50.600 --> 13:54.564
HEY. I NEED A LASAGNA RECIPE
FOR CARLOS. HI.

13:54.564 --> 13:57.407
HI. I'M ANTHONY,
ANGIE'S BROTHER.

13:57.407 --> 14:00.240
OH, YOU NEVER TOLD ME
YOU HAD A BROTHER.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.173
(chuckles) I'M SURE SHE HASN'T
TOLD YOU LOTS OF THINGS.

14:03.173 --> 14:07.117
UH, WHAT KIND OF LASAGNA DOES
CARLOS LIKE? MEAT? VEGETARIAN?
 HAVE YOU SEEN CARLOS?

14:07.117 --> 14:09.479
(chuckles)

14:09.479 --> 14:12.182
WHAT'S ALL THIS?
SOMEBODY KILL A TOASTER?

14:12.182 --> 14:14.324
ANGIE'S FIXING
MY REMOTE CONTROL,

14:14.324 --> 14:16.957
(chuckles) GIVING IT
A LITTLE EXTRA POWER.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.359
OH.
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.231
SURE.

14:21.231 --> 14:23.293
SHE WAS AN ENGINEERING MAJOR
IN COLLEGE.

14:23.293 --> 14:25.595
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE AN APPLIANCE AT HOME

14:25.595 --> 14:27.597
THAT COULD USE
SOME EXTRA POWER.

14:27.597 --> 14:31.041
AND ONCE I GET TO KNOW YOU
BETTER, I'LL TELL YOU WHICH ONE.

14:31.041 --> 14:34.004
(chuckles)
 (chuckles)
GOT THAT RECIPE YET?

14:34.004 --> 14:37.007
HERE YOU GO. (sighs)
 OH, THANKS.
WHAT DOES THIS SAY?

14:37.007 --> 14:38.548
TEN FRESH TOMATOES.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.911
CAN'T I JUST USE
SAUCE FROM A JAR?

14:40.911 --> 14:43.914
NO, YOU CAN'T JUST USE
SAUCE FROM A JAR!

14:43.914 --> 14:46.957
YOU'RE RIGHT. NO ONE WILL
EVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

14:46.957 --> 14:49.119
SEE YOU LATER.
 NICE MEETING YOU.

14:49.119 --> 14:51.121
OH, AND A LITTLE WORD
OF ADVICE--

14:51.121 --> 14:53.263
NEVER COMPARE YOUR WIFE
TO YOUR DEAD MOTHER

14:53.263 --> 14:56.596
IF YOU WANNA GET LAID
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.
 (chuckles)

14:56.596 --> 14:59.129
YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE A BOMB

14:59.129 --> 15:01.371
AND YOU HAVEN'T USED ONE
ON HER YET?

15:01.371 --> 15:03.303
I ADMIRE YOUR RESTRAINT.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.607
(door opens)

15:07.607 --> 15:10.310
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, BREE?

15:10.310 --> 15:13.183
I DID.
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

15:15.445 --> 15:17.447
DID YOU KNOW THAT REX SET UP

15:17.447 --> 15:21.091
A TRUST FUND FOR ANDREW
AND DANIELLE?
 NO, I DIDN'T.

15:21.091 --> 15:25.455
WELL, HE WANTED TO BE SURE
THEY HAD A NEST EGG TO DRAW FROM

15:25.455 --> 15:27.327
IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO HIM, WHICH IT DID.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.629
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
ALL THIS?

15:29.629 --> 15:32.702
WELL,
REX SET UP TWO TRUST FUNDS.

15:32.702 --> 15:35.966
HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN
HE HAD THREE CHILDREN,

15:35.966 --> 15:38.568
AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

15:38.568 --> 15:40.270
(opens drawer)

15:47.517 --> 15:50.280
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.182
WELL,
IT'S MY WAY OF APOLOGIZING

15:52.182 --> 15:55.355
FOR MY HUSBAND'S POOR MEMORY.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.630
I NEVER EXPECTED ANYTHING
LIKE THIS. THANK YOU.

16:00.630 --> 16:02.632
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

16:02.632 --> 16:05.695
AND I HOPE YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I HAVE APPRECIATED

16:05.695 --> 16:08.698
THE TIME YOU SPENT WITH US
AND THE WORK YOU DID.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.346
TRULY,
I WISH YOU THE VERY BEST.

16:16.346 --> 16:19.449
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD-BYE.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.451
WELL, NOW THAT YOU HAVE
ALL THIS MONEY,

16:21.451 --> 16:23.453
YOU DON'T NEED TO WORK HERE.

16:23.453 --> 16:25.985
A YOUNG MAN WITH YOUR SKILLS
SHOULD FEEL FREE

16:25.985 --> 16:29.289
TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
AND MAKE HIS MARK.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.291
BUT I LIKE IT HERE.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.293
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
I NO LONGER NEED YOU.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.295
YOU SEE, ANDREW AND I
HAVE MADE UP,

16:35.295 --> 16:37.197
AND I'M GIVING HIM YOUR JOB.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.768
WHAT?

16:38.768 --> 16:40.270
DON'T BE ANGRY.

16:40.270 --> 16:43.303
THIS IS, AFTER ALL,
A FAMILY BUSINESS.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.276
BUT I'M PART OF THE FAMILY.

16:46.276 --> 16:48.678
NOT... REALLY.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.319
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:59.319 --> 17:02.192
YOU CAN'T BUY ME OFF.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.224
I BELONG HERE.

17:05.224 --> 17:07.797
I'M A VAN DE KAMP.

17:07.797 --> 17:11.800
AND IF YOU EVER
INSULT ME AGAIN...

17:11.800 --> 17:15.204
(whispers)
YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU HADN'T.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.576
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU JAKE WALKER?

17:26.576 --> 17:27.777
YEAH.

17:27.777 --> 17:31.121
HI. I'M SUSAN DELFINO,
YOUR PLUMBER'S WIFE.

17:31.121 --> 17:34.154
OH, HEY. YEAH, MIKE'S, UH,
DONE US A FEW SOLIDS OVER HERE.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.455
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

17:35.455 --> 17:39.289
YES, AND A PROUD MAN,
WHICH IS WHY HE HASN'T TOLD YOU

17:39.289 --> 17:41.291
THAT HIS BUSINESS IS
REALLY HURTING.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.334
OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

17:44.334 --> 17:46.636
SO WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO PAY YOUR BILL,

17:46.636 --> 17:49.569
UH, FOR THE WORK HE COMPLETED...
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.271
YEAH... (clears throat)

17:51.271 --> 17:55.205
I WISH I COULD,
BUT, UH, IT'S A BAD TIME.

17:55.205 --> 17:56.676
(sniffles)

17:56.676 --> 17:58.478
(crying)

18:00.550 --> 18:02.182
YOU OKAY?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.384
OH, I'M SORRY. (sniffles)

18:04.384 --> 18:08.688
IT'S JUST, WE'RE HAVING
A BAD TIME, TOO.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.390
WE CAN'T COVER OUR BILLS,

18:10.390 --> 18:13.393
AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE
IS DUE.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.464
(sniffles)

18:14.464 --> 18:16.196
AND GOD FORBID...

18:16.196 --> 18:20.300
(sniffles) OUR SON GET
IN AN ACCIDENT.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.332
YEAH, WELL, I WOULDN'T WORRY.

18:22.332 --> 18:24.103
KIDS BOUNCE BACK.

18:26.536 --> 18:29.239
"KIDS BOUNCE BACK"?
THAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?

18:29.239 --> 18:32.242
LOOK, MY WIFE LOST HER JOB.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.484
MY TRUCK NEEDS
A NEW TRANSMISSION.

18:34.484 --> 18:37.517
WELL, MAYBE WE COULD SET UP
A PAYMENT--
 MY DAUGHTER NEEDS BRACES.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.150
EVEN IF IT'S JUST SMALL--
 NIFIT...

18:40.150 --> 18:44.394
NIFIT? TH-THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.
THAT'S JUST A SOUND.

18:44.394 --> 18:47.597
LOOK, LADY,
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU.

18:47.597 --> 18:50.700
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, OKAY?

18:50.700 --> 18:53.363
SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

18:53.363 --> 18:57.167
NO, I'M NOT
GONNA LEAVE YOU ALONE.

18:57.167 --> 19:00.370
YOU OWE ME MONEY, AND I'M NOT
GONNA REST UNTIL I GET IT.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.372
I AM GONNA MAKE SURE

19:02.372 --> 19:05.375
EVERYONE IN YOUR LIFE
KNOWS WHAT A DEADBEAT YOU ARE.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.877
WHEN YOU GO TO WORK TOMORROW,
I'LL BE THERE.

19:07.877 --> 19:11.251
WHEN YOU GO BOWLING WITH
YOUR BUDDIES, I'LL BE THERE.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.254
AND WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR VIDEO
STORE TO GET YOUR PORN, I'LL--

19:14.254 --> 19:16.886
OKAY, OKAY.
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK.

19:19.689 --> 19:22.232
OH.

19:22.232 --> 19:23.893
THANK YOU.

19:26.236 --> 19:29.599
OH.

19:29.599 --> 19:32.272
SO WITH THE PRICE OF COLLEGE
TUITION BEING WHAT IT IS,

19:32.272 --> 19:35.405
AND MY MOTHER HAD
THAT GALLBLADDER OPERATION,

19:35.405 --> 19:38.408
WELL, WE'RE JUST A LITTLE
TAPPED OUT AT THE MOMENT.

19:38.408 --> 19:40.380
WELL, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.513
BUT MIKE DID REPIPE
YOUR ENTIRE SECOND FLOOR,

19:43.513 --> 19:44.914
DIDN'T HE?

19:44.914 --> 19:48.318
YES. AND I WANT TO PAY,

19:48.318 --> 19:50.820
BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY.

19:50.820 --> 19:54.264
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

19:54.264 --> 19:55.895
THESE ARE AWFULLY CUTE.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.667
YES.

19:57.667 --> 20:01.931
MY HUSBAND GIVES ME ONE
EVERY YEAR ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.

20:01.931 --> 20:03.973
THEY'RE MY BABIES.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.975
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET.

20:05.975 --> 20:09.339
PLEASE BE CAREFUL. I DON'T
LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE TOUCH THEM.

20:09.339 --> 20:11.311
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I DON'T LIKE?

20:11.311 --> 20:15.345
I DON'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF MY HUSBAND.

20:15.345 --> 20:18.288
IT MAKES ME FEEL ALL...

20:18.288 --> 20:19.919
CLUMSY.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.722
I GUESS
I COULD MAYBE PAY YOU HALF.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.497
OHH!
OKAY, THE WHOLE THING.

20:27.497 --> 20:30.400
THE WHOLE THING.
LET ME GET MY WALLET.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.903
(singsongy) WE'LL BE WAITING!

20:33.903 --> 20:36.266
I KNOW I'M LATE IN PAYING
FOR THE WATER HEATER,

20:36.266 --> 20:37.767
BUT I'M ON A FIXED INCOME.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.770
THERE JUST ISN'T ANY MONEY LEFT
AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

20:40.770 --> 20:43.813
I MEAN, FOR ME TO EVEN
PAY FOR MY MEDICINES,

20:43.813 --> 20:46.946
I'VE HAD TO CUT DOWN
TO TWO MEALS A DAY.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.019
S-SO EVEN THOUGH
I'D LIKE TO HELP, I CAN'T.

20:50.019 --> 20:51.521
I'VE GOT NOTHING.

20:51.521 --> 20:55.525
YOU GOT A NICE WATCH.

20:55.525 --> 20:58.858
(nail file scratching)

21:12.001 --> 21:14.444
WOW.

21:14.444 --> 21:18.508
DAMN RIGHT, "WOW!" NO CEREAL
FOR DINNER TONIGHT, BABY!

21:18.508 --> 21:21.411
MRS. CROWLEY--PAID!
JIM PETERSON--PAID!

21:21.411 --> 21:25.715
AND THE ONES THAT COULDN'T PAY,
I TOOK IT IN BOOTY.

21:25.715 --> 21:28.518
A CLOCK?

21:28.518 --> 21:29.819
EARRINGS.

21:29.819 --> 21:31.521
A MENORAH?

21:31.521 --> 21:34.394
STERLING SILVER.

21:34.394 --> 21:38.368
HEY, MRS. GOTTLEIB HAS A TOILET
THAT FLUSHES, DOESN'T SHE?

21:38.368 --> 21:42.432
WHAT HAPPENED TO BATTING YOUR
EYES AND SHEDDING A FEW TEARS?

21:42.432 --> 21:45.304
(bottle clinks)
 PLAYING THE VICTIM
GOT ME NOWHERE.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.007
EVERYBODY HAD AN EXCUSE,
AND I BOUGHT IT.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.481
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I SNAPPED.

21:51.481 --> 21:54.444
RAGE JUST STARTED
POURING OUT OF ME.

21:54.444 --> 21:58.448
IT WAS LIKE MY INNER BULLY
HAD BEEN RELEASED.

21:58.448 --> 21:59.819
AND ONE BY ONE,

21:59.819 --> 22:03.353
I BROUGHT THOSE DEADBEATS
TO THEIR KNEES!

22:03.353 --> 22:05.925
OOH! FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

22:05.925 --> 22:08.928
I HAVE GOTTEN A TASTE OF POWER.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.830
(groans) I LIKE IT.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.763
YOU DO KNOW
THAT'S NOT A TWIST-OFF?

22:13.763 --> 22:16.436
YES! OW! THAT HURTS.
(sighs)

22:16.436 --> 22:19.369
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT A RUSH IT IS

22:19.369 --> 22:21.441
TO HAVE THIS ADRENALINE
POURING THROUGH ME. OOH.

22:23.112 --> 22:25.575
HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

22:25.575 --> 22:28.478
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW
AND HAVE BULLY SEX.

22:28.478 --> 22:30.119
SUSAN--
 I SAID NOW!

22:30.119 --> 22:32.682
WE CAN'T.

22:32.682 --> 22:36.085
WHY NOT?
I WANT TO CELEBRATE.

22:36.085 --> 22:38.388
I BROUGHT HOME
ALL THIS MONEY TODAY.

22:38.388 --> 22:40.960
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER
TO THE FINISH LINE.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.062
YEAH.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.134
WELL...

22:45.134 --> 22:48.468
THE I.R.S. JUST MOVED
THE FINISH LINE.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.442
OH, MY GOD.

22:52.442 --> 22:54.774
I KNOW. WE'RE SCREWED.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.446
(sighs)

22:56.446 --> 22:59.479
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:59.479 --> 23:02.682
OLD VICTIM SUSAN MIGHT HAVE
AGREED WITH YOU, BUT...

23:04.414 --> 23:09.018
NEW BULLY SUSAN IS NOT
GONNA TAKE THIS LYING DOWN.

23:10.860 --> 23:12.922
THE WAY I SEE IT,

23:12.922 --> 23:14.924
THE I.R.S. IS
A GOVERNMENT AGENCY,

23:14.924 --> 23:16.926
AND THE GOVERNMENT
ONLY EXISTS

23:16.926 --> 23:19.599
BECAUSE OF THE TAXES
THAT WE PAY.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.601
SO THAT MAKES ME YOUR BOSS.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.604
AND AS YOUR BOSS, I AM TELLING
YOU THAT WE NEED AN EXTENSION.

23:24.604 --> 23:28.007
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

23:31.741 --> 23:34.413
(seat belt clicks)

23:34.413 --> 23:36.145
(sighs)

23:36.145 --> 23:38.417
I AM A TERRIBLE BULLY.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.450
YES. YES, YOU ARE.

23:40.450 --> 23:43.453
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TACK ON
ALL THOSE EXTRA PENALTIES.

23:43.453 --> 23:45.755
DID YOU KNOW
THEY COULD DO THAT?
 YEAH.

23:45.755 --> 23:48.458
SEE, I DIDN'T,
OR I NEVER WOULD HAVE...
 YEAH, I FIGURED.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.129
(sighs)

23:50.129 --> 23:52.131
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

23:52.131 --> 23:54.604
(scoffs) I DON'T KNOW.

23:54.604 --> 23:57.106
BETWEEN THE TAXES
AND THE REST OF THE BILLS,

23:57.106 --> 23:59.769
WE'RE STILL SCREWED.

23:59.769 --> 24:02.111
WE GOT NOTHING
TO FALL BACK ON.

24:05.575 --> 24:07.046
(sighs)

24:17.757 --> 24:20.930
WE'VE GOT THE HOUSE.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.965
SAM.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.498
GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.
COME ON IN.

24:28.498 --> 24:32.201
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO OVER
THE QUARTERLY INVENTORY.

24:32.201 --> 24:34.674
YES, BUT THEN SOME OLD FRIENDS
DROPPED BY.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.846
SAM ALLEN,
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET

24:36.846 --> 24:39.949
DETECTIVE TURNER
AND SERGEANT CLEMENTE.

24:39.949 --> 24:43.112
SO... YOU'RE POLICEMEN.

24:43.112 --> 24:46.716
USED TO BE. BREE CATERED
OUR RETIREMENT PARTIES.

24:46.716 --> 24:48.818
AND DID AN AMAZING JOB.

24:48.818 --> 24:51.561
BOY, DO WE OWE HER BIG.

24:51.561 --> 24:54.564
SAM, HAVE A SEAT.
HAVE SOME TEA.

24:54.564 --> 24:57.697
NO, THANKS.
I'M NOT REALLY A BIG TEA GUY.
 OH, COME ON.
TAKE A LOAD OFF.

24:57.697 --> 25:00.970
WE GOT, UH, WE GOT ROOM
HERE ON THE COUCH.

25:00.970 --> 25:03.833
(groans)

25:05.535 --> 25:08.638
SO... THE OFFICERS WERE
JUST SHARING SOME STORIES

25:08.638 --> 25:10.640
FROM THEIR DAYS
ON THE FORCE.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.642
TELL HIM THE ONE
YOU JUST TOLD ME.

25:12.642 --> 25:15.945
ABOUT THE GUY WHO WAS HASSLING
THE NICE LADY?

25:15.945 --> 25:18.187
YES. SAM, LISTEN TO THIS.

25:18.187 --> 25:20.189
THIS GUY WAS SO CRAFTY,

25:20.189 --> 25:22.191
KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY
TO SCARE THE LADY

25:22.191 --> 25:24.153
WITHOUT TECHNICALLY
BREAKING THE LAW.

25:24.153 --> 25:27.156
YEAH, OUR HANDS WERE TIED.
NOTHING WE COULD DO. (chuckles)

25:27.156 --> 25:29.528
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SO FRUSTRATING.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.030
SCONE?

25:31.030 --> 25:33.733
THANKS. OH, IT WAS
VERY FRUSTRATING.

25:33.733 --> 25:37.036
OF COURSE, IF WE ENCOUNTERED
THE SAME SITUATION TODAY,

25:37.036 --> 25:39.939
WE'D HANDLE IT
VERY DIFFERENTLY.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.971
OH? HOW?

25:41.971 --> 25:44.273
WELL, WE'D SIT HIM DOWN
FOR A NICE CHAT.

25:44.273 --> 25:46.275
AND, UH, IF HE WOULDN'T
LISTEN TO REASON,

25:46.275 --> 25:49.719
THEN THERE ARE...
MEASURES WE COULD TAKE.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.883
OOH. SOUNDS LIKE
A MICKEY SPILLANE NOVEL.

25:53.883 --> 25:56.185
WHAT KIND OF MEASURES?

25:56.185 --> 25:58.888
WELL... (chuckles)

25:58.888 --> 26:01.330
YOU MIND? (clears throat)

26:01.330 --> 26:06.035
YOU PICK UP A PHONE BOOK,
AIM FOR THE ADAM'S APPLE...

26:06.035 --> 26:07.797
BOOM! (laughs)
 (laughs)

26:07.797 --> 26:09.669
(Bree chuckles)

26:09.669 --> 26:12.341
LET YOUR FINGERS
DO THE WALKING.

26:12.341 --> 26:14.243
OR--OR--OR HERE.
HELP ME OUT HERE.

26:14.243 --> 26:17.677
YOU, UH, DISLOCATE
THOSE TWO FINGERS

26:17.677 --> 26:19.879
AND SMACK HIM ON THE HAND.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.310
POP 'EM BACK IN.

26:21.310 --> 26:23.713
AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE.
(laughs)

26:23.713 --> 26:25.715
(laughs)

26:25.715 --> 26:28.788
GOODNESS. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
YOU'D ACTUALLY DO SUCH A THING.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.821
WELL, IF I HAD TO. I MEAN,
IF THE SITUATION CAME UP,

26:31.821 --> 26:34.193
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE...

26:34.193 --> 26:37.066
THREAT WOULD BE ENOUGH.

26:37.066 --> 26:39.729
ABSOLUTELY.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.636
SAM, YOU'RE LOOKING
A LITTLE PALE.

26:46.636 --> 26:49.979
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE TEA
OR PERHAPS A MACAROON?

26:49.979 --> 26:52.912
NO. I...

26:52.912 --> 26:56.045
THINK... I... SHOULD BE GOING.

26:56.045 --> 26:59.348
HEY, DO YOU WANT US
TO GIVE YOU A RIDE?

26:59.348 --> 27:01.821
I MEAN, WE GO RIGHT PAST

27:01.821 --> 27:04.353
474 ASH STREET.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.626
I'M GOOD.

27:12.261 --> 27:15.965
I DON'T KNOW WHY TEA PARTIES
HAVE FALLEN OUT OF FASHION.

27:15.965 --> 27:19.068
THEY'RE SO MUCH FUN.

27:19.068 --> 27:20.810
(chuckles)

27:27.877 --> 27:29.348
OKAY, PORTER.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.351
DO WHAT YOU CAN TO KEEP
YOUR BROTHER'S SPIRITS UP.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.883
DRIVE SAFELY.

27:33.883 --> 27:36.255
I--YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
MWAH.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.827
(beep)

27:37.827 --> 27:40.359
HEY, UH, MRS. SCAVO?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.391
WHAT'S WITH THE BACKPACK?

27:42.391 --> 27:44.834
YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING
THAT IT MIGHT BE GOOD

27:44.834 --> 27:47.336
IF I MOVE BACK HOME
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

27:47.336 --> 27:48.998
WHY?

27:48.998 --> 27:50.900
IRINA'S DEAD.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.272
YOUR FAMILY NEEDS TIME
TO DEAL WITH THAT.

27:53.272 --> 27:56.275
YOU DON'T NEED ME HANGING
AROUND, GETTING IN THE WAY.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.378
TO BE HONEST, I ALREADY
THINK OF YOU AS FAMILY.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.050
C-COME ON.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.382
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.984
YOUR FIRST MORNING HERE,

28:04.984 --> 28:07.286
YOU ASKED IF YOU COULD
TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

28:07.286 --> 28:12.291
BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE IN MY WILL
BY 3:00 THAT AFTERNOON.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.462
SERIOUSLY,

28:13.462 --> 28:15.464
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY.

28:17.226 --> 28:19.228
I WANT TO, BUT...

28:19.228 --> 28:22.231
MY MOM'S GONNA BE BACK
FROM HER BENDER ANY DAY NOW,

28:22.231 --> 28:24.433
AND I SHOULD BE THERE.

28:24.433 --> 28:27.706
OH. THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.209
YOUR MOM'S LUCKY
TO HAVE A SON LIKE YOU.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.943
YOU KNOW...

28:33.943 --> 28:36.185
(inhales deeply)
ONCE YOU MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY,

28:36.185 --> 28:38.187
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.752
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

28:42.752 --> 28:45.394
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

28:45.394 --> 28:48.027
D-DID YOU NOT LIKE IT HERE?

28:48.027 --> 28:50.199
NO. NO, IT WAS FANTASTIC.

28:51.861 --> 28:54.163
I SHOULD JUST GO.
THAT'S ALL.

28:54.163 --> 28:55.364
OKAY.

28:55.364 --> 28:59.208
WELL, CAN I GIVE YOU
A HUG GOOD-BYE?

29:02.071 --> 29:04.273
OH.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.750
I CAN'T HELP THINKING,

29:11.750 --> 29:15.324
I WOULD'VE TURNED OUT
SO DIFFERENT IF YOU WERE MY MOM.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.329
OH.

29:28.337 --> 29:30.269
OH.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.874
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE MOVING OFF THE LANE?

29:34.874 --> 29:36.876
YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR HOUSE.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.408
WE'RE NOT SELLING.
WE'RE RENTING.

29:39.408 --> 29:42.411
I DON'T CARE. EITHER WAY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LIVING HERE.

29:42.411 --> 29:44.113
LYNETTE, SAY SOMETHING.

29:44.113 --> 29:46.085
YOU'RE VERY PERSUASIVE.

29:46.085 --> 29:49.188
I... I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

29:49.188 --> 29:52.892
WELL, WE DUG OURSELVES IN
PRETTY DEEP FINANCIALLY.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.563
WE'LL BE FINE.

29:54.563 --> 29:57.426
IT'S JUST GONNA BE FOR A WHILE.

29:58.928 --> 30:01.400
CHECKBOOKS.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.572
NO, NO.

30:03.572 --> 30:06.175
I LOVE YOU FOR THAT, BUT NO.

30:06.175 --> 30:09.178
WE GOT OURSELVES INTO THIS.
WE CAN GET OURSELVES OUT.

30:09.178 --> 30:11.340
WHERE WILL YOU GO?

30:11.340 --> 30:13.412
WE FOUND AN APARTMENT
NEAR THE SCHOOL.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.945
AND THERE'S A PARK
AROUND THE CORNER.

30:15.945 --> 30:20.289
AND IT'S CLOSE BY, SO WE'LL
STILL BE ABLE TO SEE EACH OTHER.

30:20.289 --> 30:22.121
I HOPE SO.

30:22.121 --> 30:25.394
'CAUSE PEOPLE
ALWAYS SAY THAT AND THEN...

30:25.394 --> 30:29.058
WELL, I MEAN IT.

30:29.058 --> 30:30.860
SO DO WE.

30:51.050 --> 30:54.053
(floorboards creaking)

31:02.591 --> 31:05.864
(grunts)

31:05.864 --> 31:07.336
MA?

31:07.336 --> 31:10.139
(whispering) DANNY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:10.139 --> 31:12.141
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:12.141 --> 31:15.344
YOU TEXTED ME.
 YOU TOLD ME TO HURRY HOME.

31:15.344 --> 31:18.477
OH, GOD, THAT WASN'T ME.
DANNY, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE NOW.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.409
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:20.409 --> 31:23.582
JUST GO, DANNY. GO.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.084
(switch clicks)

31:25.084 --> 31:27.286
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

31:27.286 --> 31:28.557
(gasps)

31:30.419 --> 31:32.461
REMEMBER THAT PIECE
I SAID WAS MISSING?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.665
IT JUST ARRIVED.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.610
(humming)

31:51.610 --> 31:53.442
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING...

31:56.415 --> 31:58.447
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:58.447 --> 32:00.619
YOU KNOW, ABOUT WHAT
YOUR COP FRIENDS SAID

32:00.619 --> 32:03.922
ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE
THREATS CAN BE.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.324
I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.526
(whispers) GET OUT.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.128
I WILL,

32:09.128 --> 32:11.430
BUT NOT BEFORE
WE DO A LITTLE BUSINESS.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.433
(normal voice)
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS?

32:14.433 --> 32:17.506
I WANT YOU TO SIGN OVER
YOUR COMPANY TO ME.

32:17.506 --> 32:19.068
WHAT?

32:19.068 --> 32:21.510
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR CATERING CLIENTS,

32:21.510 --> 32:24.443
YOUR COOKBOOKS,
THE FROZEN FOOD LINE--

32:24.443 --> 32:26.075
ALL OF IT.

32:26.075 --> 32:27.376
ARE YOU INSANE?

32:27.376 --> 32:30.119
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

32:30.119 --> 32:33.622
REMEMBER THE DINNER YOU THREW
TO WELCOME ME TO THE FAMILY?

32:33.622 --> 32:37.156
WELL, DANIELLE HAD
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.527
I HEAR THAT'S GENETIC.

32:38.527 --> 32:41.560
ANYWAY,
SHE GOT PRETTY CHATTY.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.562
KEPT ASKING ME WHY I WANTED

32:43.562 --> 32:46.595
TO JOIN A FAMILY
WITH SO MANY SECRETS.

32:46.595 --> 32:49.098
UH, WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU?

32:49.098 --> 32:52.141
THE SAME THING I'M GONNA TELL
SOME OF MY COP FRIENDS.

32:52.141 --> 32:54.373
OH, AND WHILE I'M AT IT,

32:54.373 --> 32:57.376
I SHOULD PROBABLY TELL
CARLOS SOLIS, TOO.

32:57.376 --> 33:01.480
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:04.413 --> 33:07.356
I'M TALKING ABOUT ANDREW,

33:07.356 --> 33:08.587
YOUR SON,

33:08.587 --> 33:10.359
GETTING INTO A CAR

33:10.359 --> 33:13.392
AND RUNNING DOWN
CARLOS' MOTHER.

33:16.025 --> 33:19.668
SO SHOULD WE DRAW UP THE PAPERS
NOW OR WAIT TILL MORNING?

33:26.375 --> 33:29.178
IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN,
I KNOW.

33:29.178 --> 33:31.740
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.443
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING
TO LET YOU KNOW

33:34.443 --> 33:35.744
THAT WHEN YOU'RE READY,

33:35.744 --> 33:39.418
I WANT US TO HAVE A TRADITIONAL
FATHER-SON RELATIONSHIP.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.222
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.524
(laughs)

33:45.524 --> 33:47.256
I KNOW.

33:47.256 --> 33:49.128
THAT SOUNDED RIDICULOUS.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.460
AND I'M SORRY
I HAD TO TIE YOU UP.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.603
BELIEVE ME, THIS IS NOT
HOW I WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN.

33:54.603 --> 33:56.605
BUT I HAVE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO DO.

33:56.605 --> 33:58.607
ONCE I'M DONE,
I'LL UNTIE YOU,

33:58.607 --> 34:01.610
AND WE'LL HAVE TIME
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

34:01.610 --> 34:05.174
IF YOU EVER UNTIE ME,
I'LL KILL YOU!

34:05.174 --> 34:07.516
YOU'RE MAD. I GET IT.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.552
BUT EVENTUALLY,
YOU REALIZE WHO YOU'RE MAD AT.

34:15.424 --> 34:19.487
IT'S NOT THE GUY WHO SPENT
20 YEARS LOOKING FOR YOU.

34:19.487 --> 34:23.232
IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO SPENT
20 YEARS LYING TO YOU.

34:34.203 --> 34:36.475
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO DANNY?

34:36.475 --> 34:38.507
JUST A FATHER/SON CHAT.

34:38.507 --> 34:41.449
I SWEAR,
IF YOU EVER HURT HIM...

34:41.449 --> 34:44.483
GOD, EVERYBODY MAKES ME
SOUND LIKE SUCH A VILLAIN.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.585
SO...

34:46.585 --> 34:48.286
HOW'S MY BOMB COMING?

34:48.286 --> 34:51.290
IT WOULD GO A LOT FASTER
IF I COULD USE TWO HANDS.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.621
(handcuffs rattle)

34:56.695 --> 34:58.697
WELL,
WE ARE ON A DEADLINE.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.530
(groans)

35:01.530 --> 35:03.472
(door opens)
 (Gabrielle) HELLO?

35:03.472 --> 35:05.304
NOT HER AGAIN.
 (door closes)

35:05.304 --> 35:07.576
I COME BEARING GIFTS.

35:09.678 --> 35:11.180
HELLO?

35:11.180 --> 35:16.345
YOU'VE GOT 20 SECONDS TO GET HER
THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

35:16.345 --> 35:18.317
OH!

35:18.317 --> 35:21.420
HEY. SORRY TO BARGE IN,
BUT I DID A TEST RUN,

35:21.420 --> 35:24.353
AND I REALLY NEED
YOUR OPINION.
 NOW?

35:24.353 --> 35:27.296
YEAH. THIS HAS TO BE
THE BEST LASAGNA IN THE WORLD,

35:27.296 --> 35:30.299
SO WHEN I SHOVE IT DOWN CARLOS'
THROAT, HE'LL KNOW I CARE.

35:30.299 --> 35:32.561
SHE'LL TRY IT LATER.
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

35:32.561 --> 35:34.603
OH, I'M NOT GOING.

35:34.603 --> 35:36.335
SHE WON'T GO.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.367
MNH-MNH.
 LET ME JUST CUT A PIECE.

35:38.367 --> 35:41.640
TWO SECONDS. 'CAUSE DON'T
FORGET, DANNY'S WAITING FOR YOU.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.274
BE RIGHT BACK, GABY.

35:55.424 --> 35:56.585
(sighs)

35:56.585 --> 35:59.458
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THIS MUCH,
IT SMELLS GREAT.

36:01.690 --> 36:04.233
(under breath) OH, COME ON.
(sighs)

36:04.233 --> 36:06.365
THIS IS
MY FIRST MAGAZINE COVER.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.438
(beep)
 OOH. AND THIS IS ME
WHEN I DID "VOGUE." (chuckles)

36:09.438 --> 36:11.440
OH, THAT'S
MY DAUGHTER JUANITA.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.443
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT GOT IN THERE. OH!
 (beep)

36:14.443 --> 36:17.676
AND NOW THE RUNWAY YEARS.
(chuckles)

36:17.676 --> 36:20.609
ANGIE! YOU'RE KEEPING
YOUR FRIEND WAITING.

36:20.609 --> 36:21.650
OH.

36:23.452 --> 36:25.914
BE RIGHT THERE.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.865
(gasps)

36:36.865 --> 36:38.767
(sighs)

36:38.767 --> 36:41.430
OH, JEEZ.
YOU SCARED THE CRAP OUTTA ME.

36:41.430 --> 36:43.572
I'M ABOUT TO KILL
YOUR NEIGHBOR.

36:43.572 --> 36:47.476
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GET HER OUTTA HERE.

36:47.476 --> 36:51.980
GABY, I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.943
REALLY?
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT?

36:54.943 --> 36:57.846
OH, FANTASTIC. BUT WOULD YOU
MIND TAKING THE REST BACK?

36:57.846 --> 37:01.350
I'M JUST TRYING
TO WATCH MY WEIGHT.

37:03.692 --> 37:05.954
I GET IT.

37:05.954 --> 37:09.358
YOU'RE TRYING TO CUT OUT
ALL THE CRAPPY FOOD.

37:09.358 --> 37:11.560
(door opens and closes)

37:14.363 --> 37:16.435
DID MRS. BOLEN
LIKE THE LASAGNA?

37:16.435 --> 37:18.437
WELL, SHE SAID SHE DID,

37:18.437 --> 37:21.370
AND THEN SHE PRETENDED
SHE WAS ON A DIET.

37:21.370 --> 37:22.711
(sighs)

37:22.711 --> 37:25.614
WELL,
I GUESS I CAN TAKE A HINT.

37:25.614 --> 37:26.915
(thud)

37:37.626 --> 37:40.359
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

37:43.692 --> 37:46.395
HONEY, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS THE TIME

37:46.395 --> 37:48.397
TO BE CLEANING OUT
YOUR PURSE?

37:48.397 --> 37:51.470
OUR SON IS BEING
INTERROGATED FOR MURDER.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.472
I HAVE A LOT OF RAGE IN ME.

37:53.472 --> 37:56.475
WOULD YOU RATHER I CHANNEL IT
INTO THIS OR YOU?

37:56.475 --> 38:00.309
I'D PUT THE EMERGENCY TAMPON
IN THE ZIPPER POUCH.

38:00.309 --> 38:01.780
THANK YOU.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.056
PRES, HOW'D IT GO?

38:08.056 --> 38:10.058
THEY JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM

38:10.058 --> 38:13.592
THE TIMELINE I WAS IN EUROPE
THIS PAST YEAR.
 THAT'S IT?

38:13.592 --> 38:16.595
I GUESS THEY THINK THE GUY
WHO KILLED ALL THOSE GIRLS

38:16.595 --> 38:19.598
WHILE I WAS GONE IS THE SAME ONE
WHO STRANGLED IRINA.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.870
OH, THANK GOD.
SO YOU'RE FREE AND CLEAR?

38:21.870 --> 38:25.534
YOU OKAY?
 I JUST KEEP THINKING,
IRINA WOULD STILL BE ALIVE

38:25.534 --> 38:29.478
IF I HADN'T BROUGHT HER HERE.

38:29.478 --> 38:31.580
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE CAR.

38:31.580 --> 38:32.811
SWEETIE, WHEN--

38:32.811 --> 38:35.884
MOM, LET HIM GO. THIS WHOLE
THING HAS REALLY HIT HIM HARD.

38:35.884 --> 38:37.886
HOW ABOUT PORTER AND I
TAKE HIM OUT,

38:37.886 --> 38:40.889
SHOOT A FEW GAMES OF POOL,
SEE IF HE WANTS TO TALK?

38:40.889 --> 38:43.492
OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT HOME.

38:49.828 --> 38:54.403
DID YOU HEAR THEY FOUND
A SECOND BODY IN THE WOODS?

38:54.403 --> 38:56.435
THEY THINK
IT'S SOME LOCAL WOMAN--

38:56.435 --> 38:58.467
BARBARA ORLOFSKY.

38:58.467 --> 39:00.539
ORLOFSKY? ISN'T THAT
THAT WOMAN

39:00.539 --> 39:04.112
WE THROW IN THE DRUNK TANK
ABOUT ONCE A MONTH?

39:04.112 --> 39:06.915
THAT'S HER.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.626
(switch clicks)

39:17.626 --> 39:20.729
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:20.729 --> 39:23.732
(mouth full) WE WERE HUNGRY.
 SO YOU PICKED IT
OUT OF THE TRASH?

39:23.732 --> 39:26.665
YOU'RE WORSE THAN RACCOONS.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.867
SORRY.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.470
WELL, SINCE YOU HAD SOME,
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

39:33.802 --> 39:36.575
OH, YEAH? WELL, THE FRENCH TOAST
YOU MADE ME FOR MOTHER'S DAY

39:36.575 --> 39:39.608
WASN'T SO HOT EITHER.
 (moans)

39:39.608 --> 39:41.550
(spits)

39:41.550 --> 39:44.152
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

39:55.624 --> 39:58.727
(knock on door)

39:58.727 --> 40:00.529
EDDIE.

40:00.529 --> 40:03.432
MRS. SCAVO.

40:03.432 --> 40:05.434
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:05.434 --> 40:08.537
OH, SWEETIE...

40:08.537 --> 40:10.979
IT'S ABOUT YOUR MOM.

40:10.979 --> 40:14.412
OH, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED

40:14.412 --> 40:16.615
SHE'S PASSED OUT DRUNK
SOMEWHERE IN AN ALLEY,

40:16.615 --> 40:18.747
BUT YOU CAN RELAX.
I JUST SPOKE TO HER.

40:20.489 --> 40:22.891
YOU JUST... SPOKE TO HER?

40:22.891 --> 40:25.093
YEAH, LIKE, A HALF-HOUR AGO.

40:25.093 --> 40:27.696
UH, SHE'S AT MY UNCLE PETE'S
IN FLORIDA.

40:27.696 --> 40:29.828
OH.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.530
IN FACT, I-I WAS--

40:31.530 --> 40:34.533
I WAS JUST GETTING READY
TO FLY DOWN THERE...
 (zips bag)

40:34.533 --> 40:36.805
AND... WE'RE GONNA...

40:36.805 --> 40:38.837
TRY TO CHECK HER INTO REHAB.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.540
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND...

40:41.540 --> 40:45.744
OH, THANK GOD. THEY MUST HAVE
GOTTEN THE NAME WRONG.

40:50.479 --> 40:52.551
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:52.551 --> 40:55.584
OH. UM,

40:55.584 --> 40:58.587
WELL, I WAS JUST AT
THE POLICE STATION WITH PRESTON.

40:58.587 --> 41:02.561
THEY FOUND ANOTHER BODY,
AND THEY SAID IT WAS YOUR MOM'S.

41:06.635 --> 41:07.966
OH.

41:09.938 --> 41:12.641
BUT...

41:12.641 --> 41:16.575
YOU JUST TALKED TO HER,
RIGHT?

41:16.575 --> 41:18.807
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

41:26.114 --> 41:27.916
(thud)

41:34.062 --> 41:36.525
YOU DIDN'T JUST TALK TO HER.

41:38.797 --> 41:42.100
AND YOUR MOM'S NOT IN FLORIDA,
IS SHE?

41:43.802 --> 41:46.575
I REALLY WISH
YOU HADN'T COME HERE.

41:49.237 --> 41:52.510
PEOPLE MAKE CHOICES EVERY DAY.

41:53.842 --> 41:55.944
AND THOSE CHOICES...

41:55.944 --> 41:57.515
(click)

41:57.515 --> 41:59.888
ARE WHAT DEFINE US.

42:04.653 --> 42:07.696
SOME OF US CHOOSE TO BE LOYAL,

42:07.696 --> 42:10.559
THOUGH WE'RE ANGRY AND HURT.

42:14.863 --> 42:17.636
SOME OF US CHOOSE TO BE BRAVE,

42:17.636 --> 42:21.139
THOUGH WE'RE FRIGHTENED
OUT OF OUR MINDS.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.045
OTHERS CHOOSE TO STRIKE OUT

42:27.045 --> 42:30.579
WHEN THEY COULD HAVE
WALKED AWAY.

42:30.579 --> 42:34.322
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THOSE POOR PEOPLE

42:34.322 --> 42:38.186
WHO ARE TRAPPED
BY CIRCUMSTANCE?

42:38.186 --> 42:40.589
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE

42:40.589 --> 42:44.262
WHO HAVE NO CHOICES LEFT?
