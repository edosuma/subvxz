00:29.044 --> 00:32.036
Take a look at a castle, any castle.

00:32.113 --> 00:35.947
Now, break down the key elements
that make it a castle.

00:36.017 --> 00:38.781
They haven't changed in a thousand years.

00:38.854 --> 00:42.847
One, location. A site on high ground
that commands the territory...

00:42.924 --> 00:45.085
as far as the eye can see.

00:45.160 --> 00:50.757
Two, protection. big walls.
Walls strong enough to withstand a frontal attack.

00:50.832 --> 00:55.235
Three, a garrison.
Men who are trained and willing to kill.

00:55.303 --> 00:59.205
Four, a flag. You tell your men,

00:59.274 --> 01:01.265
"You're soldiers and that's our flag."

01:01.343 --> 01:03.811
You tell them, "Nobody takes our flag."

01:03.879 --> 01:06.177
One step forward. Forward!

01:09.184 --> 01:12.847
And you raise that flag so it flies
high where everyone can see it.

01:15.891 --> 01:19.349
Now you've got yourself a castle.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.294
The only difference between
this castle and all the rest,

01:22.364 --> 01:25.026
is that they were built
to keep people out.

01:25.100 --> 01:28.092
This castle is built
to keep people in.

01:57.032 --> 01:59.398
Ohh!

02:08.410 --> 02:11.243
Come on. Give me the ball.
Give me the ball, man.

02:11.313 --> 02:15.215
- Come on. Give me the fucking ball.
- Fuck you!

02:15.283 --> 02:19.617
Sir?

02:19.688 --> 02:23.021
Sir? A movement order just came in.

02:23.091 --> 02:25.389
Give it to Captain Peretz.

02:25.460 --> 02:29.954
- I'll take that, Sheila.
- It's a Category "A" transfer.

02:30.031 --> 02:33.592
Let me see it.

02:37.305 --> 02:41.935
- Fallout! Fallout! Fallout!
- Play ball, man. Come on.

02:42.010 --> 02:44.706
1700 hours?

02:47.382 --> 02:50.749
N- No, no, we're prepared.

02:53.421 --> 02:56.754
Well, it's just really fast. Okay.

02:56.825 --> 02:59.487
Mm-hmm.

02:59.561 --> 03:04.362
All right. You're sure
you're positive about this.

03:04.432 --> 03:07.595
Okay. Thankyou.

03:07.669 --> 03:13.367
Sir?

03:13.441 --> 03:16.467
It's the real deal.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.637
He is coming in at 1700 hours.

03:21.016 --> 03:23.507
Seventeen hundred hours today?

03:23.585 --> 03:26.577
That's what they said, sir.

03:28.823 --> 03:31.223
I don't understand.
The trial began today.

03:31.292 --> 03:34.659
Apparently, he pled guilty and
got ten years.

03:34.729 --> 03:37.323
They're expediting his transfer
as a courtesy.

03:37.399 --> 03:40.232
Oh, as a courtesy?

03:40.301 --> 03:44.965
They should be naming a base
after the man. Not sending him here.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.873
My God, Eugene Irwin.

03:56.851 --> 03:59.251
Well, we have verdict. We have
a sentence. We have a prisoner.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.313
We do our job...
whether we like it or not.

04:07.062 --> 04:09.030
Puts us on our toes,
though, doesn't it?

04:36.891 --> 04:40.224
Escort detail
report to Gate 18. Prisoner.

04:40.295 --> 04:43.628
Escort detail meet
the prisoner on Gate "A. "

05:09.491 --> 05:11.755
I give him a week.

05:11.826 --> 05:14.226
- 'Til what?
- 'Til he "scrags" himself.

05:14.295 --> 05:17.628
The court-martial didn't
put him over the edge,

05:17.699 --> 05:20.065
- I guarantee you the shithouse will.
- A week?

05:20.135 --> 05:22.899
- Six bundles.
- Six? Let's make it ten.

05:22.971 --> 05:25.804
- All right. Make it ten then.
- Ah, there we go.

05:25.874 --> 05:29.105
Ten bundles, Mr. Dellwo.
Very specific, man.

05:29.177 --> 05:33.079
- Anybody else?
- You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

05:33.148 --> 05:36.845
Come on. We'll make it like the Final
Four. Ten bundles a square. Who's in?

05:36.918 --> 05:41.412
I'm not going to bet on whether or not
a man's going to kill himself.

05:41.489 --> 05:45.721
That's some creepy shit, pilot.

05:45.793 --> 05:49.786
Besides, look at him. One week?
He's tougher than that.

05:49.864 --> 05:52.196
How much tougher?
Eight, ten, what?

05:52.267 --> 05:56.397
- Eight.
- Anyone else?

05:56.471 --> 05:59.304
- You're an ice-cold motherfucker, Yates.
- Hey, I'm not betting...

05:59.374 --> 06:01.399
he's going to off himself.
I'm just playing the books.

06:01.476 --> 06:05.606
- What about you, Cutbush? I know you're in.
- Put me in for a week and a half.

06:06.214 --> 06:08.205
- A week and a half?.
- Wallace?

06:08.283 --> 06:11.775
- Go ahead.
- I have the transfer "A" to the P.R.U. now.

06:11.853 --> 06:15.380
- Copy that. P.R.U.
- One wallet. Leather.

06:15.456 --> 06:18.948
- Family photos?
- My daughter.

06:21.496 --> 06:23.657
- Grandson.
- Would you like to keep these?

06:23.731 --> 06:25.665
Um, that's an authorized item.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.133
I'd appreciate that.

06:28.203 --> 06:32.435
One set of keys. Glasses.

06:32.507 --> 06:34.634
I'm going to need your ring.

06:38.846 --> 06:40.905
Thankyou.

06:40.982 --> 06:45.646
Oh. Actually, you can keep that.
Academy rings are authorized.

06:53.061 --> 06:57.725
Three stars, two sets.
Looks like that's everything.

06:57.799 --> 07:01.462
So, uh-

07:01.536 --> 07:06.371
- Sir? Prisoner Irwin is outside.
- Five minutes.

07:10.878 --> 07:16.544
Five minutes.
You can put that down if you want.

07:18.253 --> 07:21.586
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

07:36.971 --> 07:41.499
I know what you're thinking.
Do I salute you, or do you salute me?

07:41.576 --> 07:44.067
Well, the answer is neither.

07:44.145 --> 07:47.171
My men salute me, of course,
and each other according to rank.

07:47.248 --> 07:50.581
But there is no saluting
by the general prison population.

07:54.289 --> 07:56.757
Well, first things first.
Are you hungry?

07:56.824 --> 08:02.023
- No.
- Are you sure? Mondays are our Salisbury steak night.

08:02.096 --> 08:04.758
- Always a cause for celebration.
- Indeed.

08:04.832 --> 08:09.496
Indeed. May I
offer you some lemonade?

08:09.570 --> 08:13.233
- Thankyou.
- Just be a minute, sir.

08:13.308 --> 08:15.936
- Prisoner Aguilar-
- If you'll step over here, I'll give you...

08:16.010 --> 08:18.843
a basic layout of the facility.

08:18.913 --> 08:22.906
The building we're in now
is the administration building.

08:22.984 --> 08:25.475
That building there houses the tiers.

08:25.553 --> 08:30.047
That's where you
and the other inmates will live.

08:30.124 --> 08:33.821
The building next to it is the laundry,
where I've had you assigned.

08:35.730 --> 08:38.698
Oh, that is the old blockhouse wall.

08:38.765 --> 08:42.429
It's all that's left of
the original prison from the 1870s.

08:42.503 --> 08:45.836
I could've removed it, but I thought
it was important to keep a sense of history,

08:45.907 --> 08:48.068
so I asked the men to rebuild it.

08:48.142 --> 08:51.942
- They seem to enjoy it. It's a matter of
some pride now.

08:53.214 --> 08:56.445
- Sir?
- Yes? Please, on the table there.

08:57.952 --> 08:59.943
Please.

09:01.089 --> 09:03.284
Come on. Let's go.

09:05.026 --> 09:10.191
I personally meet with
every new inmate here at the prison.

09:10.264 --> 09:12.255
Usually downstairs.

09:12.333 --> 09:15.598
And I ask them a question.

09:15.670 --> 09:20.334
What do you expect from
your time here at the castle?

09:20.408 --> 09:24.742
Nothing.
Just to do my time and go home.

09:24.812 --> 09:29.078
Perfect.
That is the perfect answer.

09:33.888 --> 09:38.382
And now I have what may seem under
the circumstances, a bizarre request.

09:38.459 --> 09:41.951
I have a collection of most
of the seminal books on warfare,

09:42.029 --> 09:45.362
including The Burden of Command.

09:45.433 --> 09:48.095
And I was wondering if you would
do me the honor of signing it?

09:48.169 --> 09:52.162
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.334
- Captain Peretz.
- Yes, sir?

09:55.410 --> 09:57.742
Two minutes.

10:11.359 --> 10:15.693
- That's impressive.
- Yeah. It's a great collection, isn't it?

10:18.800 --> 10:21.291
Yeah, sure.

10:22.904 --> 10:27.500
That's a mini-ball
from Shiloh, used in battle.

10:27.575 --> 10:29.907
Grant lost 13,000 men at Shiloh.

10:31.813 --> 10:33.747
Suppose this got one of' em?

10:33.815 --> 10:37.842
Never know. Do you?

10:37.919 --> 10:40.410
I mean, do you collect anything?

10:40.488 --> 10:42.353
No.

10:42.423 --> 10:44.891
Just a few coins from some of
the countries I've traveled to.

10:44.959 --> 10:50.454
My father didn't care for military
collections. I guess it stuck with me.

10:50.531 --> 10:56.197
Any man with a collection like this is a
man who's never set foot on a battlefield.

10:56.270 --> 11:00.070
To him, a mini-ball from
Shiloh is just an artifact.

11:00.141 --> 11:04.976
And to a combat vet, it's a hunk of metal...

11:05.046 --> 11:07.105
that caused some poor bastard a world of pain.

11:12.353 --> 11:15.220
I must have misshelved it...
your book.

11:15.289 --> 11:20.625
We'll do it another time.
No, please, please. Allow me.

11:22.630 --> 11:25.121
Sir, lights out in five.
Do I hold the lock?

11:25.199 --> 11:28.999
No. No. We are-
We're through here.

11:36.744 --> 11:40.737
Prisoner Aguilar, what are you doing?
You do not salute this man.

11:40.815 --> 11:45.650
This man has no rank.
Saluting amongst prisoners is prohibited.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.884
Y- Yes, sir.
Bu-But I was saluting you.

11:52.860 --> 11:56.523
- Take the prisoners to their cells, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

11:56.597 --> 11:58.827
Thankyou for
your hospitality, Colonel.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.834
You're welcome.

12:02.403 --> 12:06.237
Inmates,
one step to the rear... halt!

12:07.575 --> 12:09.509
Shut the doors!

12:11.512 --> 12:15.004
You're gonna be in cell 345.

12:15.082 --> 12:18.415
You get to shower every other day.

12:18.486 --> 12:24.186
- Okay, hold up.
- You fuck! I'm going to kill you!

12:24.258 --> 12:28.752
Shut up, Beaupre.

12:28.829 --> 12:31.161
Do not cross
the yellow line while in formation.

12:31.232 --> 12:34.224
During the day, you're free to be in
this area we're walking in right now.

12:34.302 --> 12:36.702
- Showers on both sides.
- Those stars don't mean shit now, do they?

12:36.771 --> 12:41.299
You're allowed one book in your cell,
in addition to the Bible.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.536
Go up here, then make a right.

12:43.611 --> 12:45.943
- I've got eight bundles on you, General!
- Let's see-

12:46.013 --> 12:49.847
No, no, no. You got to hold out
for five weeks, then kill yourself!.

12:52.520 --> 12:57.890
Three-four-five. Crash 345.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.462
All right, General!

13:08.536 --> 13:11.027
First call, 0600.

13:11.105 --> 13:13.437
- What'd you do, man?
- What are you here for, man?

13:13.507 --> 13:16.340
- Close 345.
- How many did you kill?

13:34.328 --> 13:36.421
Welcome to the castle, baby!

13:37.098 --> 13:38.497
Sir?

13:40.501 --> 13:42.992
Sir?

13:43.070 --> 13:47.302
Prisoner Irwin's in his cell.

13:47.375 --> 13:51.869
- He's really something, isn't he?
- Mmm.

13:53.514 --> 13:58.383
Would you like
the end-of-day report, sir?

13:58.452 --> 14:01.944
- Is everyone where they're supposed to be?
- Yes, sir.

14:02.023 --> 14:05.481
Then skip it.

14:05.559 --> 14:09.723
Very good, Colonel.
Is there anything else?

14:13.234 --> 14:17.102
Tomorrow, put out
only one basketball.

14:17.171 --> 14:19.264
What you doing?

14:22.109 --> 14:24.942
- You just hit a brick wall.
- Nigga, why you doin' that shit?

14:25.012 --> 14:27.913
- Come on, little brother.
- Get your hands off me!

14:27.982 --> 14:30.280
Come on, bitch!

14:36.524 --> 14:39.220
Three-to-one
on the little man.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.220
Stab him!

14:44.298 --> 14:47.062
Come on, Thumper. Kill 'im!

14:47.134 --> 14:49.261
Come on, bitch!

14:52.540 --> 14:54.872
What are you doing?

14:54.942 --> 14:59.743
- Man, you don't like it, Doc, take a walk.
- You're fuckin' sick, Yates.

15:08.355 --> 15:11.017
You see how easy it is to manipulate men?

15:12.727 --> 15:16.128
Someone should write a paper on it.

15:50.197 --> 15:52.859
Hold.

16:08.816 --> 16:13.185
Come on! Come on, bitch!

16:16.457 --> 16:19.483
- End it.
- Sound the horn.

16:24.165 --> 16:28.067
On the ground now!

16:31.138 --> 16:35.598
All inmates remain
on the ground in a prone position.

16:35.676 --> 16:38.042
Get the hell down now!

16:38.112 --> 16:40.876
- Thumper, get down!
- I didn't mean it!

16:40.948 --> 16:43.212
Get down, Thumper! Get down!

16:43.284 --> 16:45.275
- Get down, Thumper!
- Yes, sir.

16:45.352 --> 16:50.221
All inmates remain
on the ground in a prone position.

16:50.291 --> 16:52.885
No! I didn't do anything!

16:52.960 --> 16:56.555
Thumper, get down!

16:56.630 --> 16:58.291
Sound off

17:08.742 --> 17:13.611
Oh, shit!

17:33.934 --> 17:35.629
- Watch where you're going.
- Kiss my ass!

17:35.703 --> 17:38.194
Don't worry about it.
We'll do it later.

17:43.510 --> 17:45.842
- Damn nigger!
- What?

17:45.913 --> 17:48.507
- You heard me!
- Say it to my face, white bitch!

17:48.582 --> 17:53.519
I'm gonna kick your white ass
through the air! Shut the fuck up!

18:01.929 --> 18:04.193
What the fuck you doing, beano? Hey!

18:04.265 --> 18:07.257
I said what the fuck are you doing?

18:07.334 --> 18:10.770
- The mortar's weak, Beaupre.
- Don't worry about it.

18:10.838 --> 18:13.306
- Mind your own business.
- Cool out, man.

18:13.374 --> 18:16.366
Shut the fuck up,
or I'll stick this in your neck.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.673
They'll throw you back in the hole.

18:18.746 --> 18:23.740
- It's all w-weak.
- Don't worry about the mortar.

18:23.817 --> 18:26.980
- M-My daddy's- My daddy's a mason.
- Spit it out.

18:27.054 --> 18:31.457
I don't give a fuck if your dad built the
pyramids. Whites work the wall, period.

18:31.525 --> 18:35.723
Get back on Spic duty and bring me
some rocks before I give you a slap.

18:35.796 --> 18:39.288
- They won't set, Beaupre.
- What did I just tell you?

18:39.366 --> 18:41.698
What'd I just tell you?
We're only doing this...

18:41.769 --> 18:44.567
to keep Johnny-fucking-eyeballs
off our back.

18:44.638 --> 18:46.936
Don't make me tell you again.
Back the fuck off!.

18:47.007 --> 18:49.441
Beaupre! Knock it off.

18:51.946 --> 18:55.575
What? Big hero.

18:55.649 --> 18:58.914
Don't worry about me
going back to the hole.

19:20.107 --> 19:22.098
How you doing?

19:28.782 --> 19:32.274
You probably don't remember me,
but I served under you in the Gulf.

19:34.321 --> 19:36.812
Dr. Thomas Bernard,
33rd Medical Unit.

19:36.890 --> 19:41.589
That's right. Actually, it's
Lee Bernard, but close enough.

19:43.297 --> 19:48.257
You were arrested for hashish-
possession of hashish- as I remember.

19:48.335 --> 19:51.498
- That's right.
- It was a small amount, as I recall.

19:51.572 --> 19:54.006
- You don't get sent here for that.
- No, no. You don't.

19:54.074 --> 19:57.737
There's more to it than that.
Hey, Thumper!

20:01.782 --> 20:05.616
- I was able to get you an aspirin.
- Thanks.

20:05.686 --> 20:08.177
I got shot
with a real bullet once, Doc.

20:08.255 --> 20:10.746
Didn't hurt this much.

20:10.824 --> 20:14.385
That's the upside of real bullets, they cut
through the flesh, hit fewer nerve endings.

20:14.461 --> 20:16.952
Downside is they kill you.

20:17.031 --> 20:20.194
Of course, so do
the rubber ones sometimes.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.428
Hell of a downside.

20:22.503 --> 20:25.336
Hey, Doc, you think I might
get one of them Purple Hearts?

20:25.406 --> 20:29.069
Absolutely, Thumper. You take it easy.
I'll try to get you some more.

20:29.143 --> 20:33.807
You know Winter played us with that
one basketball shit? Come on, man.

20:37.985 --> 20:40.977
- General, sir.
- Don't call me sir. I'm not a general anymore.

20:41.055 --> 20:43.546
- Can we at least talk to you?
- About what?

20:43.624 --> 20:46.593
You still got friends in the Pentagon,
right? You could talk to them.

20:48.729 --> 20:50.924
I'm a little hazy
on the subject matter.

20:50.998 --> 20:53.660
Look, what happened here today
happens all the time, sir.

20:53.734 --> 20:56.396
- Let me get this straight. You mean there's violence?
- Yeah.

20:56.470 --> 20:59.462
- In a prison packed with violent criminals.
- That's not what we're saying.

20:59.540 --> 21:02.703
No. There's been-
How many this year, Doc?

21:02.776 --> 21:05.210
Um, 13 men down, 11 of them
were critical injuries-

21:05.279 --> 21:07.747
Stop your fucking whining.
Listen to yourselves.

21:07.815 --> 21:11.080
Then he only gives us the most
basic medical treatment.

21:11.151 --> 21:13.085
Completely substandard services.

21:13.153 --> 21:16.486
- Substandard services?
- Yes. Substandard services.

21:16.557 --> 21:18.889
It's fucked-up shit, man.

21:18.959 --> 21:23.555
I had a friend in Hanoi who had
to repair his own fractured tibia.

21:23.630 --> 21:27.225
You cannot begin to compare what went on
in a foreign POW camp 30 years ago-

21:27.301 --> 21:29.633
No, you can't compare.

21:29.703 --> 21:33.366
I've led real soldiers in more
difficult situations than this.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.171
But you're not real soldiers
anymore, and neither am I.

21:41.615 --> 21:45.483
There've been murders.

21:45.552 --> 21:48.749
Do you know what happens when
you take a rubber bullet to the head?

21:48.822 --> 21:50.756
The lights go out.

21:50.824 --> 21:53.315
Twice in the last year
there've been accidents...

21:53.393 --> 21:57.386
- where men have been hit in the head and killed.
- Nothing can be proven.

21:57.464 --> 22:00.797
We're talking about expert marksmen
shooting from minimal distances.

22:00.868 --> 22:03.530
The guards just say the guy
turned his head and boom.

22:03.604 --> 22:07.096
It's not a random thing. You get on
Winter's bad side, you're done.

22:07.174 --> 22:10.507
When you're doing combat duty, after awhile,

22:10.577 --> 22:14.308
life just becomes snapshots.

22:14.381 --> 22:19.045
Most of them horrible.
But not all ofthem.

22:19.119 --> 22:24.614
Three years ago in Bosnia, I was driving
a small unit through an I FOR town.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.716
And I saw something pretty interesting.

22:26.793 --> 22:29.318
I saw an old man sitting on a bombed-out porch,

22:29.396 --> 22:33.230
playing a game of Dominos with
what I presume is his grandson.

22:33.300 --> 22:37.634
When I saw that I thought,
"you know, it's my turn. "

22:37.704 --> 22:42.698
I didn't retire after that, as I should have.
I took one last assignment.

22:42.776 --> 22:45.438
It was a mistake.

22:45.512 --> 22:47.639
So, gentlemen, I'm done.

22:47.714 --> 22:52.048
I'm not fighting anyone
or anything anymore.

22:52.119 --> 22:54.781
I'm doing my time here,
I'm going home, and God willing,

22:54.855 --> 22:57.517
I'm going to sit on the porch
and play a game of Dominos...

22:57.591 --> 22:59.525
with my grandson, who I've never met.

23:01.929 --> 23:04.090
What'd I fucking tell you, Doc?

23:04.164 --> 23:07.565
You call a three-star General "man"?
Why don't you call him "dude"?

23:11.071 --> 23:15.405
Attention, inmates,
the library will close early at 1700 hours.

23:15.475 --> 23:17.807
The library will close
early tonight at 1700 hours.

23:17.878 --> 23:21.177
- Watch yourself, snitch.
- Hey, Yates, everything all right?

23:21.248 --> 23:23.239
- Okay.
- My boys say you got a nice ass.

23:23.317 --> 23:26.150
I got a guy in 129 who's
way behind, telling me stories.

23:26.220 --> 23:28.154
- How late is he?
- Three weeks.

23:28.222 --> 23:31.714
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

23:31.792 --> 23:35.455
Yates, no way that was a touchdown,
baby. That was a fucked-up call.

23:35.529 --> 23:39.192
Keep that shit on the down-low.
They're all fucked-up calls.

23:46.673 --> 23:49.403
How you doing?

23:49.476 --> 23:53.173
So we lost: 22 to 20.

23:53.247 --> 23:55.238
Army-Navy game.

23:55.315 --> 23:57.681
Class of '92.

24:06.193 --> 24:09.253
I met you once when I was a kid.

24:09.329 --> 24:14.596
1981. It was a welcome-back celebration
at the White House for the POWs.

24:14.668 --> 24:17.501
- My father was with you in Hanoi.
- What's your name?

24:17.571 --> 24:21.029
- Yates.
- Yates? Sam Yates?

24:21.108 --> 24:23.440
That's right.

24:23.510 --> 24:26.570
- Good man.
- Nah, he wasn't.

24:26.647 --> 24:30.583
After 30 years, everyone's
a good man. It's the law.

24:30.651 --> 24:33.711
- Mmm.
- How is he? How's your dad?

24:33.787 --> 24:36.051
He's not too good. He's dead.

24:36.123 --> 24:39.559
I'm sorry. What happened?

24:39.626 --> 24:42.493
Came home.

24:42.562 --> 24:47.261
Billingworth, Irwin, Jacobson-

24:50.637 --> 24:54.801
You're late. You have five minutes
left on your visitor.

24:54.875 --> 24:59.175
Five minutes left.

25:03.917 --> 25:06.750
Rosalie?

25:06.820 --> 25:10.312
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:10.390 --> 25:14.292
- It's good of you to come.
- Thank you.

25:14.361 --> 25:17.057
Was it hard getting here?

25:17.130 --> 25:19.860
Um, I missed a turn.

25:22.369 --> 25:25.861
It's just good to see you.

25:25.939 --> 25:28.931
- How's Ben? Good?
- Fine. Uh-huh.

25:29.009 --> 25:33.002
- School okay? Grades?
- Um, well he's in first grade.

25:35.115 --> 25:38.949
- Well, do you have a picture of him?
- No.

25:39.019 --> 25:43.649
The one I have is two years old. He must
have changed a lot since- since then.

25:45.359 --> 25:48.351
And how are you, Rosalie?

25:48.428 --> 25:50.419
Um-

25:53.100 --> 25:55.933
- Look, Dad-
- Uh-oh. "Look, Dad."

25:56.002 --> 25:58.994
I just- I can't do this.

25:59.072 --> 26:02.337
I can't do this small-talk thing
with you.

26:02.409 --> 26:06.209
The whole drive over here,
I was trying to think what-

26:06.279 --> 26:09.214
What am I going to say? What can
we talk about beyond the weather...

26:09.282 --> 26:12.683
and how's Ben,
and I just went blank.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.150
Do I- Do I intimidate you?

26:16.223 --> 26:18.418
- Intimidate me?
- I guess that's the downside...

26:18.492 --> 26:23.486
of having a "Yes, sir" "No, sir"
military father, but I tried not to-

26:23.563 --> 26:25.997
You weren't a father at all.

26:29.302 --> 26:33.295
God, I'm sorry. I don't want to whine.
I'm not here to be cruel.

26:35.542 --> 26:38.204
You're a great man.

26:39.613 --> 26:43.447
And you've done so much
for this country.

26:43.517 --> 26:48.181
- But?
- No. No but. No but.

26:48.255 --> 26:51.622
Just this isn't the place.

26:51.691 --> 26:56.128
Well, it's the only place
I've got right now, Rose.

26:56.196 --> 27:02.032
Why did you call me, Dad? Why? I
don't know you. You don't know me.

27:05.305 --> 27:07.296
I mean, what did you think
asking me here?

27:07.374 --> 27:09.706
That I'd come every Sunday
and maybe I'd bring Ben...

27:09.776 --> 27:12.540
and he would sit
and color while we talked?

27:12.612 --> 27:15.445
There was a time.
When I was about 20,

27:15.515 --> 27:19.679
I had a whole list of things
I was going to say to you.

27:19.753 --> 27:23.052
Those days are gone.

27:23.123 --> 27:26.615
The visitation session is over.
Please conclude your visits.

27:26.693 --> 27:29.753
- This isn't enough time, man.
- Let's go, folks. Let's go.

27:29.830 --> 27:35.496
I'm sorry you're in this place.
And I wish you the best.

27:38.305 --> 27:40.739
I wish you the best.

27:43.176 --> 27:47.340
I guess you figured out
what to say after all.

27:47.414 --> 27:50.577
- I guess I did.
- Be all right if I wrote? Is that okay?

27:52.018 --> 27:55.010
There's some things
I'd like to tell you.

28:03.463 --> 28:05.931
When I was in first grade,
I got straight "As."

28:10.804 --> 28:14.035
Come on. Let's go.

28:14.107 --> 28:18.271
- Afternoon, sir.
- Don't call me that. I'm not-

28:18.345 --> 28:20.836
Put your hand down.

28:32.526 --> 28:35.859
- Permission to speak, sir.
- What?

28:35.929 --> 28:39.421
I just wanted to say
welcome to the castle, sir.

28:39.499 --> 28:43.162
- It's good to have you aboard, sir.
- Aboard?

28:43.236 --> 28:48.333
- You Navy puke, son?
- No, no, sir. I was in the Corps.

28:48.408 --> 28:51.002
What rank were you
when you were arrested?

28:51.077 --> 28:54.240
- I was a C-C-C-
- It was either Colonel or Corporal.

28:54.314 --> 28:57.044
- I'm guessing Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

28:57.117 --> 29:01.178
Why are you here?
What did you do?

29:01.254 --> 29:05.554
Well, that's just it.
I di-didn't do nothing.

29:05.625 --> 29:08.492
It was a mistake.

29:08.562 --> 29:11.258
Oh. Okay.

29:11.331 --> 29:13.993
Medication call is in five minutes.

29:14.067 --> 29:17.730
I h-hurt someone real bad.

29:21.875 --> 29:23.866
How long you been here?

29:23.944 --> 29:26.936
- Two years.
- And how long do you have? How much longer?

29:27.013 --> 29:29.846
Four years, eight months, eleven days.

29:29.916 --> 29:33.682
And this mistake, you've just the one?

29:33.753 --> 29:37.746
Just-Just one.

29:37.824 --> 29:41.316
- Just one day in your life?
- Ju-Ju-Ju-

29:41.394 --> 29:45.592
No. Take your time.
Got plenty of that.

29:45.665 --> 29:48.896
Just five seconds, sir.

29:48.969 --> 29:51.130
And you're a marine for what,
one or two years?

29:51.204 --> 29:53.138
And you're a violent criminal
for five seconds?

29:53.206 --> 29:55.868
- Yes, sir.
- Well, according to my calculations,

29:55.942 --> 30:01.539
that makes you mostly Marine.
About 98 percent, I'd say.

30:04.250 --> 30:07.913
- Yes, sir.
- Then why not act like one? Stand tall.

30:07.988 --> 30:11.480
This thing that you're doing with your
hand, grabbing your hair, what's that?

30:11.558 --> 30:15.050
- That was a salute.
- A sa- Oh, no.

30:15.128 --> 30:18.723
- I don't think so. You know where saluting comes from?
- No, sir.

30:18.798 --> 30:24.293
It comes from medieval times. Two knights
would approach each other on horseback.

30:24.371 --> 30:28.205
They would raise their visors
and show their faces.

30:28.274 --> 30:30.765
It's like they're saying,
"This is who I am.

30:30.844 --> 30:33.278
I'm not the enemy and I'm not afraid."

30:33.346 --> 30:38.511
A salute's about respect, son. Respect
for yourself, the service and the flag.

30:38.585 --> 30:40.314
If you're going to do this-

30:40.387 --> 30:43.879
Sir, you wanted to see me? Sir?

30:44.457 --> 30:47.722
Come.

30:47.794 --> 30:49.785
Look at that.

30:53.266 --> 30:56.258
- Oh, man.
- No, no, no.

30:58.405 --> 31:03.001
At the War College,
his very name was spoken...

31:03.076 --> 31:05.067
with a reverence.

31:05.145 --> 31:10.811
As if the syllables themselves conveyed
what it meant to be a soldier.

31:13.453 --> 31:17.617
Now here he is commanding
an army of one-

31:17.691 --> 31:20.524
the stuttering monkey.

31:24.397 --> 31:26.729
Can't even watch.

31:31.137 --> 31:34.800
I discussed the regulations
on saluting with Aguilar, did I not?

31:34.874 --> 31:39.470
- Yes, sir.
- Remind him again- effectively.

33:12.906 --> 33:15.238
Put your hand down.

33:15.308 --> 33:19.745
Put it down.

33:19.813 --> 33:22.008
- You don't have to do this.
- Prisoner Irwin, what are you doing?

33:22.081 --> 33:25.244
- He doesn't have to do this.
- Look, just step back in the prison-

33:25.318 --> 33:27.650
Son, I know a thing or two
about the disciplining of soldiers.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.915
- Prisoner Aguilar, resume your punishment.
- Punishment is over.

33:29.989 --> 33:32.116
Aguilar, I'm warning you-

33:32.192 --> 33:34.592
Men down! Men down!

33:34.661 --> 33:37.824
You're better than this.

33:40.767 --> 33:45.602
Okay, okay. That's enough.

33:45.672 --> 33:48.664
All inmates remain
on the ground in the prone position.

33:48.741 --> 33:53.144
All inmates remain on the
ground in the prone position.

33:56.416 --> 34:00.011
Stay down! Everybody stay down!

34:00.086 --> 34:02.077
What is happening here?

34:02.155 --> 34:06.353
This prisoner was interfering with the
corporal punishment of prisoner Aguilar.

34:09.829 --> 34:15.199
Prisoner Irwin, I understand your coming
here must be a big adjustment for you.

34:15.268 --> 34:19.261
To go from commanding
thousands of troops in battle,

34:19.339 --> 34:22.900
having no war to fight and no one
to follow you must not be easy.

34:22.976 --> 34:27.811
However, I do ask that you learn
how things are done around here...

34:27.880 --> 34:30.543
and try to set an example
for the other men.

34:32.918 --> 34:37.083
Saluting is prohibited.
Aguilar was saluting.

34:37.156 --> 34:40.751
He is being disciplined.
Surely you understand that.

34:44.197 --> 34:46.824
- Captain, take the prisoner back to his cell.
- Yes, sir.

34:47.934 --> 34:51.370
Sir? May the prisoner speak, sir?

34:54.373 --> 34:58.708
- Yes.
- According to the Manual of Conduct,

34:58.778 --> 35:02.214
the corporal punishment for
a prisoner begun on the day shift...

35:02.282 --> 35:05.513
cannot exceed the following morning's horn.

35:09.022 --> 35:11.513
Prisoner Irwin,
you are absolutely right.

35:11.591 --> 35:15.254
Thank you for bringing that
to my attention.

35:15.328 --> 35:20.459
- Captain. Captain.
- Yes, sir.

35:33.513 --> 35:36.277
Prisoner Irwin,
under no circumstances...

35:36.349 --> 35:38.749
is an inmate allowed to make
physical contact with an officer.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.312
You have violated the
U.S.M.C.F. Manual of Conduct.

35:45.024 --> 35:47.618
And this violation requires discipline.

35:58.671 --> 36:00.605
What's going on?

36:00.673 --> 36:04.837
- Winter's got him on rock-and-roll
detail. - Is he not going to make it?

36:04.911 --> 36:08.244
No way. Three-two against.

36:08.314 --> 36:11.147
Come on, you guys.
Those stones weigh 25lbs a piece.

36:11.217 --> 36:13.151
It's gonna be 85 degrees by noon.

36:13.219 --> 36:17.212
We have 2,000 percent humidity.
The guy's not going to make the day.

36:17.290 --> 36:20.453
- Everyone paid up this week?
- Yeah, we're good.

36:20.526 --> 36:23.188
Put mine in, double or nothing
against. No way he's gonna make it.

36:23.262 --> 36:26.527
- Beaupre, 12.
- Double or nothing, against.

36:26.599 --> 36:31.764
Hey, hey, hey.

36:34.107 --> 36:37.099
Who's down for ten?

36:42.749 --> 36:46.742
At least take some water.
If you're dehydrated, you're gonna drop.

36:49.822 --> 36:52.655
- Can he take it off, boss?
- Captain?

37:02.635 --> 37:06.127
You can take off
your shirt if you want.

37:14.914 --> 37:16.905
- Hey!
- What the fuck is that?

37:16.983 --> 37:20.817
- Electrical burn scars.
- What do you mean? How long was he in there?

37:20.887 --> 37:23.219
Six years.
Could've got out in four.

37:23.289 --> 37:25.553
They offered him a full release,
but he stayed six.

37:25.625 --> 37:29.117
He said he wouldn't leave
without his men.

37:29.195 --> 37:31.993
Come on, baby! Drop that rock!

37:45.211 --> 37:48.044
Come on, General. You can do it.

37:48.114 --> 37:52.448
- Come on, baby!
- Push that rock, soldier!

37:56.789 --> 38:00.122
Kind of tired, sir.
Why don't you call it quits?

38:00.193 --> 38:03.458
Don't listen to him, sir.
It's not that hot.

38:03.529 --> 38:05.861
Why don't you call it quits, sir?

38:12.138 --> 38:14.038
Go, General! Come on, baby!

38:18.311 --> 38:22.111
Come on.
One more rock! You got it, sir!

39:03.422 --> 39:06.755
That's it. It's over. Somebody
pushed me. That's it. He's down.

39:06.826 --> 39:10.421
- He can't go on like that. It's all over. Stay down.
- Look at me.

39:11.631 --> 39:15.465
- Follow it.
- It's all done. All over.

39:15.535 --> 39:18.299
It's all over.
Yates, 36 packs you owe me.

39:18.371 --> 39:21.363
- How many?
- Four.

39:21.440 --> 39:25.001
- What day is it?
- Saturday.

39:25.077 --> 39:29.070
He's fine.

39:50.436 --> 39:55.373
- Yeah!
- Go! Go! Go!

40:10.890 --> 40:12.881
Yes, sir.

40:21.767 --> 40:25.897
The discipline order
was horn-to-horn labor.

40:25.972 --> 40:28.167
Doesn't matter where the stones are.
You have to continue.

40:28.241 --> 40:31.210
What's he supposed to do, Captain?
He just moved the whole goddamn pile.

40:31.277 --> 40:33.211
Well, he can move 'em back.

40:35.281 --> 40:37.374
Bets are still on.

40:37.450 --> 40:40.078
- Seven-two, against.
- You're a fuckin' snake, man.

40:40.152 --> 40:43.315
- Don't bet if you don't want to.
- Yates, four in favor.

40:43.389 --> 40:46.881
Four in favor, Aguilar.
Four in favor!

40:46.959 --> 40:49.450
Who's down for ten?

40:52.365 --> 40:56.131
The horn.
They're holding the horn.

40:56.202 --> 40:59.296
Winter's holding the horn.
That ain't right.

40:59.372 --> 41:02.705
Son of a bitch.

41:15.354 --> 41:18.687
All right, everybody to the tiers for count!

41:18.758 --> 41:21.727
- Let's go! Move it!
- Inmates will move to tiers...

41:21.794 --> 41:23.921
for face-to-badge count.

41:23.996 --> 41:27.090
Inmates will report to the tiers
for face-to-badge count.

41:31.971 --> 41:35.304
Why would you kill yourself
to help him with his wall?

41:38.778 --> 41:42.270
It's not his wall.
It's your wall.

41:42.348 --> 41:44.782
Prisoner Irwin, let's go.

41:50.456 --> 41:54.085
The commandant would like to see you.

42:03.703 --> 42:07.036
- They clean you up okay?
- Yes.

42:07.106 --> 42:09.939
The cut above your eye,
it's not too serious I hope.

42:10.009 --> 42:12.273
I'm okay.

42:12.345 --> 42:17.009
Well, I am sorry about this.

42:17.083 --> 42:20.575
It's the standard cooling-off period
after a punishment detail.

42:24.390 --> 42:28.349
I hope you understand...
I did this for the men.

42:28.427 --> 42:32.090
- The men?
- Yes, to show them-

42:32.164 --> 42:36.658
To show them that you are
no different than they are.

42:38.471 --> 42:42.464
Your new friend, Aguilar, he took
a claw hammer to his platoon leader.

42:42.541 --> 42:47.342
He maimed him in a quote,
unquote fit of rage.

42:47.413 --> 42:52.214
Whenever I am...
filled with doubt-

42:52.284 --> 42:55.151
whenever sentiment creeps in-

42:55.221 --> 43:00.215
I just have to open an inmate's file
and see what he's done.

43:00.292 --> 43:03.625
I see what he's capable of.
I see the worst in him.

43:04.897 --> 43:06.888
And that makes my job easier.

43:06.966 --> 43:11.403
It crystallizes my mission.

43:19.712 --> 43:23.876
- Take him back to the tiers.
- Yes, sir.

43:27.253 --> 43:29.244
Hold on.

43:47.740 --> 43:52.074
- Sergeant, taking him back to cell345.
- Very well, Private.

44:40.459 --> 44:43.519
General!

44:44.997 --> 44:47.488
Goodnight, guys.

44:47.566 --> 44:51.400
- Your winnings.
- My winnings?

44:51.470 --> 44:53.961
Aguilar placed a bet for you.

44:54.039 --> 44:58.976
Four bundles at seven-to-two,
two bundles at eleven to one. That's 36 bundles.

44:59.044 --> 45:02.207
You could get yourself thrown out of the
Hall of Fame for betting on yourself.

45:04.884 --> 45:07.216
Corporal Aguilar.

45:09.288 --> 45:11.882
Would you pass these out
to the men? I don't smoke.

45:14.093 --> 45:16.084
Thank you, sir.

45:21.767 --> 45:26.363
- So you're the gambler.
- Nah, I don't gamble. I'm just the bookkeeper.

45:26.438 --> 45:31.273
- Yeah? I hear you're running a suicide pool on me.
- That's right.

45:31.343 --> 45:35.177
- Any squares left?
- Yeah, there's one.

45:35.247 --> 45:37.772
Nine weeks.

45:37.850 --> 45:40.250
- How much to enter?
- No way, man.

45:40.319 --> 45:43.049
Knowing you, you'd off yourself
just to win the bet.

45:43.122 --> 45:46.683
Oh-ho, not me.
I bet on myself, it's to win.

45:46.759 --> 45:50.058
Yeah, you don't always win.

45:50.129 --> 45:53.997
No.
Clearly not.

45:56.869 --> 45:59.099
You know, my father said
you kept him alive in Hanoi.

45:59.171 --> 46:03.665
- He said you kept all those guys alive.
- Nah.

46:07.279 --> 46:10.771
When you're tortured, the first thing they
do is try to break down your sense of self.

46:10.849 --> 46:13.340
And I broke in Hanoi.

46:13.419 --> 46:17.082
For weeks, the last thing in
my mind was self-preservation.

46:17.156 --> 46:21.957
In fact, I prayed
for death every night.

46:22.027 --> 46:24.860
And the only thing that kept me
from answering those prayers,

46:24.930 --> 46:30.527
were the voices of the men in the
other rooms- your father among them.

46:30.603 --> 46:34.403
I don't care what you've heard, Yates.
They kept me alive.

46:34.473 --> 46:37.772
Not the other way around.

46:39.211 --> 46:41.543
Hey! Sir?

46:41.614 --> 46:44.208
You cost me my whole stash
of smokes.

46:44.283 --> 46:46.615
Oh. Well, I'm sorry about that.

46:46.685 --> 46:49.176
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

46:51.690 --> 46:54.181
So what did you mean earlier
about it being our wall?

46:54.259 --> 46:58.093
I mean, it's Winter's wall. That fuck just
makes us work it to keep us occupied.

46:58.163 --> 47:00.654
It's like we're a bunch
of little kids or something.

47:00.733 --> 47:03.896
In 1870, there was nothing here.

47:03.969 --> 47:07.302
The original prison was built
by prisoners. I want to show-

47:07.373 --> 47:10.706
I want to show you something
I found the other day.

47:10.776 --> 47:12.937
Where?

47:13.012 --> 47:16.004
Oh, here it is.

47:16.081 --> 47:18.743
You see this?

47:18.817 --> 47:24.653
"Private A.J. Beck, 1912-1923."

47:26.692 --> 47:30.025
Now why do you suppose
Private Beck-

47:30.095 --> 47:32.928
What do you think he was doing,
building his own prison?

47:32.998 --> 47:38.493
- How the fuck do I know?
- Well, I don't know either, but I can make a guess.

47:38.570 --> 47:41.061
My guess is he wasn't
building a prison.

47:43.442 --> 47:46.275
My guess is he was
building something else.

47:46.345 --> 47:49.337
They may have told him to build
a prison, but, in his own mind,

47:49.415 --> 47:52.748
he was raising walls
to protect himself.

47:55.320 --> 47:58.551
My guess is he was
building a castle.

47:58.624 --> 48:00.615
That's a castle?

48:00.693 --> 48:05.494
Yeah, it could be. Could be.

48:05.564 --> 48:08.055
- If somebody rebuilt it.
- How we supposed to do that, sir?

48:08.133 --> 48:12.467
How are you supposed to do that?
I don't know anything about walls.

48:12.538 --> 48:15.837
Why don't you ask pri-
Ask Aguilar.

48:15.908 --> 48:18.399
His dad's a mason.

49:07.092 --> 49:09.424
Niebolt!

49:16.268 --> 49:18.429
Good morning, sir.

49:18.504 --> 49:21.667
- What happened here?
- The prisoners, they knocked it down, sir.

49:21.740 --> 49:25.574
- Why?
- Irwin, he told them to.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.241
Thank you.

49:47.332 --> 49:49.823
Beau-Beaupre?

49:52.871 --> 49:55.362
What's up, Aguilar?

49:57.209 --> 50:00.372
Th- That's not the right rock.

50:00.445 --> 50:02.436
Cutbush, you believe this kid?

50:02.514 --> 50:06.507
Yeah, he seems to know his shit, you know?

50:06.585 --> 50:08.917
All right, Aguilar. I'll bite.

50:08.987 --> 50:12.718
- Bring me the right rock.
- O-Okay.

50:15.127 --> 50:18.119
You need a rock
with a flat edge,

50:18.197 --> 50:21.860
because-because that one's jagged.

50:21.934 --> 50:25.927
- Th-The jagged ones go in the middle.
- The middle? All right.

50:28.273 --> 50:30.264
Bring me another one.

50:30.342 --> 50:33.436
If I keep getting you the flat rocks,
you'll never learn-

50:33.512 --> 50:36.345
I'll get you one more, okay, Beaupre?

50:37.683 --> 50:40.675
Mr. Aguilar? It looks good.

50:40.752 --> 50:43.414
Thanks, Chief.

50:46.892 --> 50:49.122
- Morning, Chief.
- Molly be damned

50:49.194 --> 50:53.187
Smote Jimmy the Harp
with a horrid little pistol and a lariat

50:53.265 --> 50:56.757
She's goin' to the bottom
She's goin' down the drain

50:56.835 --> 51:01.169
Said she wasn't big enough
to carry it

51:01.240 --> 51:04.801
She said,
"Get behind the mule"

51:04.877 --> 51:08.540
- Gotta get behind the mule
- Pu-Put that on the outside.

51:11.016 --> 51:13.348
You gotta get behind the mule

51:13.418 --> 51:16.410
In the morning and plow

51:16.488 --> 51:19.821
You gotta get behind the mule

51:19.892 --> 51:23.555
In the morning and plow

51:26.932 --> 51:29.833
I'm impressed.
Pretty handy with a trowel.

51:31.370 --> 51:34.203
- Good work, you guys.
- You know it, Chief.

51:34.273 --> 51:37.606
- Nice work.
- Thanks, Chief.

51:39.378 --> 51:43.872
- What do you think?
- I think she's beautiful.

51:43.949 --> 51:48.318
- That's the word.
- Eighteen courses in one week.

51:48.387 --> 51:51.049
Aguilar...

51:51.123 --> 51:53.614
I'm proud of you.
You should be proud.

51:57.362 --> 52:01.594
- Men did good, huh?
- They did.

52:01.667 --> 52:05.501
Now, listen. Be sure to leave a window,
a portal. Every castle has one.

52:05.570 --> 52:09.631
Aguilar? Excuse me, Chief.
Aguilar, come here a minute.

52:09.708 --> 52:14.145
- Go ahead.
- Guys, hold up a minute.

52:14.212 --> 52:17.204
Hold up the work.

52:17.282 --> 52:20.445
Hold up.

52:20.519 --> 52:22.680
Maybe you should go first.

52:25.924 --> 52:29.758
Put your name in the wall.
Hey, hold up on the work.

52:29.828 --> 52:32.661
Come on.
Put your name right in here.

52:33.865 --> 52:39.770
Spell it out.
A- G-G-G.

52:39.838 --> 52:43.569
- Scumbags are having at it, sir. Yes, sir.
- Really?

52:43.775 --> 52:47.142
They're calling Irwin "Chief."
That's the word they got for General.

52:47.212 --> 52:50.545
They got substitute names
for the other ranks, too, sir.

52:50.615 --> 52:55.279
Anybody who was a captain is "Boss."
Sergeants are "Sport," Privates are "Pal."

52:55.354 --> 52:59.051
Playing soldier, sir.

52:59.124 --> 53:02.025
- Hearts and minds.
- Sir?

53:02.094 --> 53:06.758
He's building a structure of loyalty.
He's offering them self-respect,

53:06.832 --> 53:10.666
in exchange for obedience.

53:10.736 --> 53:13.603
The general is building himself an army.

53:13.672 --> 53:17.005
He can have their hearts and minds, sir.
As long as we got 'em by the balls.

53:17.075 --> 53:19.509
- Well put, Corporal.
- Thank you, sir.

53:19.578 --> 53:21.739
Captain.

53:27.119 --> 53:29.349
- Bring him to my office.
- Who, sir?

53:29.421 --> 53:31.912
- The prince of Venezuela. Who do you think?
- General Irwin?

53:31.990 --> 53:35.016
Mr. Irwin.

53:35.260 --> 53:40.197
When you first arrived,
I asked you a question. I need to ask again.

53:40.265 --> 53:44.099
What do you want from your time
here at the castle, Mr. Irwin?

53:44.169 --> 53:46.228
And my answer is the same as it was then.

53:46.304 --> 53:48.238
Do my time. Go home.

53:48.306 --> 53:53.300
So you say, but everything
you have done has contradicted that.

53:53.378 --> 53:58.213
These men are not here
for unpaid parking fines and traffic-

53:58.283 --> 54:00.945
I'm under no illusion why
the men are here, Colonel.

54:01.019 --> 54:03.010
I just think they might
be reminded...

54:03.088 --> 54:05.579
about some of the good things they've
done, rather than only the worst.

54:05.657 --> 54:08.820
Yes, that is- that is something
my predecessor used to say.

54:08.894 --> 54:11.556
In his last two years here there
were seven escape attempts,

54:11.630 --> 54:15.964
twelve injury assaults on officers
and N.C.O.s, including one killed.

54:16.034 --> 54:18.525
Since I've assumed command,
there have been zero escape attempts,

54:18.603 --> 54:21.265
zero injury assaults,
zero fatalities.

54:21.339 --> 54:24.536
Some may question
my methods, but they do work.

54:24.609 --> 54:28.739
No soldier has ever died needlessly
under my command, Mr. Irwin.

54:28.814 --> 54:32.045
See, I, too, share
the burden of command.

54:32.117 --> 54:34.085
You may not think that
I've ever set foot on a battlefield,

54:34.152 --> 54:38.179
but that's because you've never
sat behind this desk- this desk.

54:38.256 --> 54:40.190
My men and I are
vastly outnumbered.

54:40.258 --> 54:43.227
We spend every day
behind enemy lines.

54:43.295 --> 54:47.197
Because, make no mistake about it,
Mr. Irwin, they are the enemy.

54:47.265 --> 54:50.530
But I don't need to justify
myself to you, do I?

54:50.602 --> 54:52.695
I don't know.

54:52.771 --> 54:55.535
Do you?

54:58.110 --> 55:00.408
This wall...

55:00.479 --> 55:04.813
that has become the focus
of so much... tension...

55:04.883 --> 55:07.579
and turmoil-

55:07.652 --> 55:13.147
Well... in about two minutes,
there will be no more wall.

55:39.818 --> 55:42.787
Back away from the wall-

55:42.854 --> 55:45.186
Back away!

55:45.257 --> 55:47.851
Come on!

55:47.926 --> 55:49.860
Back away from the wall.

55:53.598 --> 55:55.896
Come on!

55:55.967 --> 55:58.800
Aguilar!
Aguilar, damn it!

55:58.870 --> 56:01.236
What is he doing?

56:07.012 --> 56:08.411
Sound the horn.

56:16.521 --> 56:18.250
Agui- Get down!

56:18.323 --> 56:21.690
- All inmates remain on the ground-
- Aguilar, get down!

56:21.760 --> 56:24.661
What the hell are you doing?
Get down, Aguilar.

56:24.729 --> 56:28.290
- No!
- Get down!

56:28.366 --> 56:33.895
- Hey, what are you doing, Ramon? Get down!
- Aguilar, get down!

56:33.972 --> 56:38.773
- Aguilar, get the hell
down! - Zamorro. - Yes, sir.

56:41.680 --> 56:44.911
- You bet, sir.
- What the hell are you doing?

56:44.983 --> 56:46.917
- Get down!
- Get down! Get down!

56:46.985 --> 56:49.579
- Aguilar, get down!
- Get down!

56:57.095 --> 57:00.292
- Aguilar?
- Permission to examine the prisoner, sir.

57:00.365 --> 57:02.799
- Doc! Come on!
- Sir.

58:07.632 --> 58:10.123
- Dellwo.
- Sir?

58:11.703 --> 58:15.503
- You're a sergeant-major?
- I was.

58:15.573 --> 58:19.839
Prisoners! Fall in!

58:21.813 --> 58:25.078
I said, fall in!

58:25.150 --> 58:28.608
Let's go, ladies!
Now! Now! Now!

58:30.555 --> 58:32.853
All right!
Let's fall in!

58:32.924 --> 58:35.950
Fall in!
We don't got all day!

58:36.027 --> 58:39.190
Come on. Fall in!

58:39.264 --> 58:41.630
You look like
a bunch of old women!

58:41.700 --> 58:45.158
Fall in, goddamn it! Fall in!

58:45.236 --> 58:47.568
Now! Now! Now!

58:50.842 --> 58:54.573
- Scumbags runnin' the asylum?
- Maybe.

59:15.700 --> 59:18.066
Some may think to be
remembered in this way...

59:18.136 --> 59:21.264
would be a disgrace
to a soldier.

59:23.208 --> 59:26.735
But this is not a disgrace.

59:26.811 --> 59:30.440
The greatest monuments
to fallen men...

59:30.515 --> 59:32.574
are not made in marble.

59:34.652 --> 59:37.212
They're deep in the sea,
deep in the jungles,

59:37.288 --> 59:39.882
on foreign battlefields,

59:39.958 --> 59:42.222
a rifle driven into the ground,

59:42.293 --> 59:45.820
with a helmet on top... and some tags.

59:48.466 --> 59:52.562
And that is the tribute
that this man has earned.

01:00:07.118 --> 01:00:11.987
Gentlemen,
Corporal Ramon Aguilar,

01:00:12.056 --> 01:00:14.320
United States Marine Corps.

01:00:17.495 --> 01:00:22.023
From the halls of Montezuma

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.332
To the shores of Tripoli

01:00:26.404 --> 01:00:30.738
We fight our country's battles

01:00:30.809 --> 01:00:33.801
In the air on land and sea

01:00:33.878 --> 01:00:38.372
First to fight
for right and freedom

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.510
And to keep
our honor clean

01:00:41.586 --> 01:00:46.046
We are proud
to claim the title

01:00:46.124 --> 01:00:49.116
Of United States Marines

01:00:49.194 --> 01:00:52.789
Duh-duh, da, da, da, da
Da, duh-duh

01:00:52.864 --> 01:00:56.493
La, la-la, la
La-la, la

01:00:56.568 --> 01:01:00.060
Sir, do you-

01:01:08.146 --> 01:01:12.845
Da-da da Da-da
da da Da-da da

01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:16.978
Da-da da da
Da-da da da-da

01:01:17.055 --> 01:01:19.523
Sound the chow horn.

01:01:20.758 --> 01:01:22.749
Sir, you still have
about ten minutes.

01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:26.160
- Sound it.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:26.231 --> 01:01:31.635
Da da-da da...

01:01:31.703 --> 01:01:34.695
Present...

01:01:34.772 --> 01:01:36.535
arms!

01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:01.395
Fall... out!

01:02:07.605 --> 01:02:10.802
Chow call.
All inmates report to the mess hall.

01:02:10.875 --> 01:02:14.470
Chow call. All inmates
report to the mess hall.

01:02:19.317 --> 01:02:21.478
So, tell me again.

01:02:21.553 --> 01:02:24.147
Why is it
Aguilar had to die?

01:02:38.937 --> 01:02:41.371
- Believe us now?
- I believe you now.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.306
Very good.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:48.072
You have checkmate in five moves.

01:02:48.146 --> 01:02:50.774
Looks that way, sir.

01:02:52.283 --> 01:02:54.877
Why you movin' if I have
checkmate in five moves?

01:02:54.953 --> 01:02:58.354
'Cause I have
checkmate in three.

01:02:58.423 --> 01:03:01.620
Shall we, uh, call it a draw?

01:03:03.428 --> 01:03:06.056
If you'll excuse us, Mister, uh-

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:08.963
Enriquez.
Let's go. Move it out.

01:03:34.392 --> 01:03:37.122
Your, uh,

01:03:37.195 --> 01:03:39.220
grandson.

01:03:39.297 --> 01:03:41.492
Yes.

01:03:41.566 --> 01:03:44.296
Very cute.

01:03:44.369 --> 01:03:47.429
- Five?
- Four, when that picture was taken.

01:03:47.505 --> 01:03:49.735
- Oh.
- Six now.

01:03:54.278 --> 01:03:57.441
It was unfortunate about...

01:03:57.515 --> 01:04:00.507
Aguilar.

01:04:00.585 --> 01:04:03.349
But tough decisions do go with the job.

01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:06.750
Burden of command, correct?

01:04:11.663 --> 01:04:14.325
Look.

01:04:14.399 --> 01:04:19.132
These salutes, I've given
them some thought.

01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:24.300
Technically, they are not
a violation of regulations.

01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:29.472
So, if the inmates can
confine themselves to a simple...

01:04:29.547 --> 01:04:32.744
hand movement
through the hair,

01:04:34.318 --> 01:04:37.151
I see no problem with it.

01:04:38.923 --> 01:04:42.825
And if the men want to call
you chief, well, that's fine.

01:04:42.894 --> 01:04:46.057
Free speech and all that.

01:04:52.203 --> 01:04:56.833
- Okay, then.
- No, not okay.

01:04:56.908 --> 01:04:58.876
It's too late, Colonel.

01:04:58.943 --> 01:05:02.470
- It's too late for what?
- For your offer.

01:05:02.547 --> 01:05:04.515
The men don't want to salute.

01:05:04.582 --> 01:05:06.743
They don't want to use rank.

01:05:06.818 --> 01:05:08.843
They don't want better food.
They don't want more TV.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.718
They just want your resignation.
So do I.

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.688
- My resignation?
- You're a disgrace, Colonel.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.819
A disgrace to the uniform.

01:05:17.895 --> 01:05:21.558
You should not be allowed
to retain your command.

01:05:25.203 --> 01:05:28.695
Well, then I'd better go pack.

01:05:28.773 --> 01:05:33.608
- I think you should.
- Oh?

01:05:33.678 --> 01:05:37.205
Tell me, Mr. Irwin,
what's to stop me from just...

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:40.614
placing you in the hole...
for, say, six months?

01:05:40.685 --> 01:05:43.779
Nothing.

01:05:43.855 --> 01:05:45.789
If that's the way you want to win.

01:05:51.362 --> 01:05:53.296
Sir, if I can make a suggestion,

01:05:53.364 --> 01:05:56.424
- maybe we should isolate prisoner
Irwin- - Get me General Wheeler.

01:05:58.903 --> 01:06:00.996
Yes, sir.

01:06:06.544 --> 01:06:11.948
Two weeks ago, I watched as he marched
a man up and down the yard.

01:06:12.016 --> 01:06:14.382
A minor eccentricity. Fine.

01:06:14.452 --> 01:06:16.886
Since then,
he's been acting as though...

01:06:16.954 --> 01:06:20.981
he still has a command
in some fantasy army.

01:06:21.058 --> 01:06:24.118
- And yesterday- - I don't
think you'd want to make general.

01:06:24.195 --> 01:06:27.028
Now, you wouldn't want to give up
all these perks, would you?

01:06:30.034 --> 01:06:31.968
Sorry. Go on.

01:06:32.036 --> 01:06:34.402
Yesterday, Mr. Irwin...

01:06:34.472 --> 01:06:38.408
told me he required my resignation.

01:06:38.476 --> 01:06:41.172
Frankly, I think he's
started to lose the plot.

01:06:41.245 --> 01:06:43.713
You saying he's delusional?

01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:47.512
I'm saying he needs
professional psychiatric help.

01:06:47.585 --> 01:06:49.815
He's sick and becoming pathetic.

01:06:49.887 --> 01:06:53.015
Uh, you might want to be a little
more careful in your word choice.

01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:56.548
That sick, pathetic man
put this star on my shoulder.

01:06:56.627 --> 01:06:58.561
Yes, sir. I know.

01:06:58.629 --> 01:07:02.656
And I also know that
you sat in on his court-martial.

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:06.863
And don't talk about things
that are above your pay grade.

01:07:06.938 --> 01:07:09.372
- Hmm?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:15.613 --> 01:07:18.810
General Wheeler, I admire
the man as much as you do.

01:07:18.883 --> 01:07:21.351
So I want to see that
he gets the best care possible.

01:07:21.419 --> 01:07:23.887
And I'm not sure that
this is the right place for that.

01:07:24.956 --> 01:07:27.754
All right.
Well, let me see him.

01:07:48.212 --> 01:07:50.703
Do we read the rules, sir?

01:07:50.781 --> 01:07:52.908
Read 'em.

01:07:52.984 --> 01:07:55.714
Well, sir, normally
for a contact visit,

01:07:55.786 --> 01:07:59.381
folks are limited to one embrace
in the beginning and one at the end.

01:07:59.457 --> 01:08:02.255
And, uh, hands must be
visible at all times, also.

01:08:02.326 --> 01:08:04.453
I guess that rules out the hand-job.

01:08:08.699 --> 01:08:10.690
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:16.901
- Permission to be seated, sir.
- Permission granted.

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:35.920
- What are you doing here, Jim?
- I'm here to see if you've lost your mind.

01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:38.723
Uh, he should be available later.

01:08:38.796 --> 01:08:40.787
- I can take a mes- Just a second.
- Good morning, Miss Kelly.

01:08:40.865 --> 01:08:42.799
- Jim-Jim, yeah- Hold on-
- Miss Kelly?

01:08:42.867 --> 01:08:44.801
Miss Kelly,
I got everything here but...

01:08:44.868 --> 01:08:47.064
- the athletic gear.
- I found that-

01:08:47.138 --> 01:08:49.231
I found that top one laying on
the floor out in the hallway.

01:08:49.307 --> 01:08:51.832
- Hold on one second. What, Danny?
- I found that top one...

01:08:51.908 --> 01:08:54.104
- laying on the floor in the hallway.
- Fine. Thanks, Danny.

01:08:54.178 --> 01:08:57.738
Uh, yeah. We just needed you to send
him up here as soon as possible.

01:08:59.951 --> 01:09:02.078
He's saying you're delusional,

01:09:02.153 --> 01:09:05.316
that you're acting as if you're
still in command of an army.

01:09:05.389 --> 01:09:08.483
He's saying I'm delusional
because he wants me gone.

01:09:31.048 --> 01:09:33.073
Now, if you had iron-clad evidence...

01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:35.743
of Winter killing a man in cold blood
for no good reason,

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:38.618
then I could do something, maybe.

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:41.385
Outside of that, the man's been
investigated three times.

01:09:41.459 --> 01:09:44.019
He's been
exonerated three times.

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:46.221
And as far as Washington
is concerned,

01:09:46.296 --> 01:09:48.457
he's doin' a superb job.

01:09:48.532 --> 01:09:50.932
Yeah, and you're
a convicted criminal.

01:09:54.739 --> 01:09:57.606
- You could get another investigation.
- Yes, I could.

01:09:57.675 --> 01:10:00.303
But without any new evidence,
what would be the point?

01:10:00.378 --> 01:10:02.608
And besides that,
Gene, honestly,

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.841
I don't give a rat's ass.

01:10:04.915 --> 01:10:07.179
I don't care.

01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:09.776
What I care about is you
and getting you out of here.

01:10:09.854 --> 01:10:12.721
Now, haven't you
punished yourself enough?

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:15.691
- What I did was wrong, Jim.
- All teams.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.354
All teams, this is a full S.O.R.T. alert.

01:10:18.429 --> 01:10:22.661
Repeat, all teams,
this is a full S. O.R. T. alert.

01:10:33.244 --> 01:10:35.678
I cannot let this continue.

01:10:35.746 --> 01:10:38.806
Now, you will get out of here,
and you will go spend some time...

01:10:38.883 --> 01:10:41.044
with your daughter and your grandson.

01:10:41.118 --> 01:10:43.916
I can have my staff write up
a compassionate release on medical grounds.

01:10:43.988 --> 01:10:46.354
- It can say whatever you want it to say.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

01:10:46.424 --> 01:10:49.723
For Christ's sake, will you work with me?

01:10:49.794 --> 01:10:54.390
- There is nothing wrong with me.
- I see no indication of anything, sir.

01:10:54.465 --> 01:10:58.060
Of course not. He'll keep it hidden
until the last possible second.

01:11:02.239 --> 01:11:04.332
Red Team, go.

01:11:04.408 --> 01:11:06.433
Go, go, go!

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:10.378
Gene, what the hell is this about?
Is this about control?

01:11:10.448 --> 01:11:14.179
- Because, you know, no castle can have two kings.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:18.017
Get down!
On the floor, now!

01:11:18.089 --> 01:11:19.989
- General, you must come with us.
- What are you doing?

01:11:22.193 --> 01:11:24.753
All inmates remain
on the ground in the prone position.

01:11:24.829 --> 01:11:27.263
All inmates remain on the ground-

01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:29.458
- Let's go!
- What is this!

01:11:29.533 --> 01:11:32.093
What is this
for Christ's sake?

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.405
Go! Let's go!
Go, go, go, go!

01:11:50.154 --> 01:11:53.317
All right!

01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:20.380
Sir? Tear gas?

01:12:20.451 --> 01:12:23.579
Return to hangar.
Nothing is happening.

01:12:23.654 --> 01:12:25.747
It was a bluff.

01:12:25.823 --> 01:12:29.054
You can take her home.
Return to hangar.

01:12:30.995 --> 01:12:32.986
You thought he was gonna try
to take me hostage?

01:12:33.063 --> 01:12:36.089
- Yes, it was a precautionary move.
- What the hell kind of...

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:38.328
grab-ass unit are you
running here, Colonel?

01:12:39.737 --> 01:12:42.535
Sir, at 11:58 this morning,
I received a letter...

01:12:42.606 --> 01:12:47.202
stating a group of inmates were
planning on taking you hostage at 12:10.

01:12:47.278 --> 01:12:50.213
I thought it prudent to act immediately
to ensure your safety.

01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:53.444
I've been hearing some disturbing
things about what goes on in here.

01:12:53.517 --> 01:12:57.180
And now I'm hearing it from a man
I trust and whose opinion I respect.

01:12:57.254 --> 01:12:59.245
- May I speak freely, sir?
- Yes, you may.

01:12:59.323 --> 01:13:01.257
With all due respect, General,

01:13:01.325 --> 01:13:03.919
I don't know what
you may have been hearing.

01:13:03.994 --> 01:13:06.724
But until you've spent some time
in the yard with those animals,

01:13:06.797 --> 01:13:09.857
you have no idea
what happens in there.

01:13:09.934 --> 01:13:12.402
Point taken, Colonel.

01:13:12.469 --> 01:13:15.029
Nevertheless, if I hear...

01:13:15.105 --> 01:13:18.268
one more story about a man dying
under your command, you are through here.

01:13:18.342 --> 01:13:23.109
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:24.381 --> 01:13:27.714
All right.

01:13:27.785 --> 01:13:31.186
As far as Gene Irwin is concerned, it is
my judgment he is as sane as you or I.

01:13:31.255 --> 01:13:34.122
I wish he wasn't. He is.

01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:37.217
Frankly, I'd like nothing more than
an excuse to get him out of here.

01:13:37.294 --> 01:13:40.957
But I see the only way that's
gonna happen is if you request it.

01:13:42.132 --> 01:13:44.692
That is true, sir.

01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:49.068
So you just- You tell me
you can't handle him. He's gone.

01:13:50.307 --> 01:13:52.935
Oh, I think
I can handle him, sir.

01:13:54.411 --> 01:13:56.902
You watch yourself, Colonel.

01:14:01.619 --> 01:14:03.746
"Eugene R. Irwin,

01:14:06.523 --> 01:14:09.959
"Lieutenant General,
United States Army,

01:14:10.027 --> 01:14:12.825
"in direct contravention of
an order to evacuate Burundi...

01:14:12.896 --> 01:14:16.024
by his commander-in-chief-"

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:19.467
That is the president,
for those of you who do not know.

01:14:19.536 --> 01:14:25.133
"... selected a platoon of men to
extract Jackson Ngwe, a local warlord.

01:14:25.209 --> 01:14:28.770
"Disregarding reliable intelligence,

01:14:28.846 --> 01:14:32.213
"General Irwin's reconnaissance team
entered the villa at 0300.

01:14:32.283 --> 01:14:36.219
Eight men were captured
and executed. "

01:14:36.287 --> 01:14:38.653
Disregarding...

01:14:39.823 --> 01:14:43.156
reliable intelligence...

01:14:43.227 --> 01:14:45.286
eight men...

01:14:45.362 --> 01:14:47.421
were executed.

01:14:51.335 --> 01:14:53.701
What I want you men
to understand...

01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:56.968
is what
the consequences can be...

01:14:57.041 --> 01:15:00.408
when you choose to follow
a man who is motivated...

01:15:00.477 --> 01:15:02.968
solely by his pride.

01:15:03.047 --> 01:15:08.849
A man who will do anything
for one more victory notch on his belt,

01:15:08.919 --> 01:15:11.387
no matter what the cost,

01:15:11.455 --> 01:15:14.754
before he fades away.

01:15:21.365 --> 01:15:24.391
Start the extractions.

01:15:37.014 --> 01:15:39.278
Over here!
Come here!

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:41.284
Let's go.
Get out! Get out!

01:15:41.352 --> 01:15:44.185
Hi, Doc. Let's go for a little walk.

01:15:45.422 --> 01:15:47.447
Get the fuck back!

01:15:47.524 --> 01:15:50.049
- Open 355!
- Open it up!

01:15:51.595 --> 01:15:55.622
Look at you. Relax, ladies.

01:15:55.699 --> 01:15:57.758
Hold him down, men!

01:15:57.835 --> 01:15:59.803
I had nothing to do with this!

01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:01.269
No!

01:16:03.006 --> 01:16:03.995
Uhh!

01:16:12.383 --> 01:16:14.874
- Why don't you just execute me?
- No reason for that!

01:16:14.952 --> 01:16:17.944
Turn him around.

01:16:18.021 --> 01:16:21.548
- - Don't put me in the hole!

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:25.254
Oh, don't-
don't put me in the hole! No!

01:16:31.335 --> 01:16:33.803
- You want that?
- No.

01:16:33.871 --> 01:16:35.805
- Thanks, man.
- You bet.

01:17:31.195 --> 01:17:33.186
What do we do now?

01:17:35.466 --> 01:17:38.026
- Jimmy, wait up!
- Attention, inmates.

01:17:38.101 --> 01:17:41.070
All visitation requests
must be submitted...

01:17:41.138 --> 01:17:43.732
to the S-3 by 1100 today.

01:17:43.807 --> 01:17:48.574
- All visitation requests- - So, you
really did- You really did bluff Winter.

01:17:48.645 --> 01:17:52.274
The problem is his flush
beat your straight.

01:17:52.349 --> 01:17:54.715
I don't play poker, Mr. Yates.
I play chess.

01:17:54.785 --> 01:17:58.277
And in chess, you play
with somebody long enough,

01:17:58.355 --> 01:18:01.449
you come to realize that their
first three moves are usually the same.

01:18:01.525 --> 01:18:03.584
Chess, huh?
What was his first move?

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.788
- What was the first move?
- First, uh, two teams,

01:18:06.864 --> 01:18:10.459
- 20 men apiece.
- Like I was saying, the inside teams only have batons.

01:18:10.534 --> 01:18:12.832
- Second?
- Second? Water cannon.

01:18:12.903 --> 01:18:15.337
- Third? What kind of chopper?
- Chopper.

01:18:15.405 --> 01:18:18.238
Sir, are you sure we should be having
this discussion this man standing-

01:18:18.308 --> 01:18:20.572
You know he can't
be trusted, right?

01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:23.808
I don't know.

01:18:25.849 --> 01:18:28.409
Is that how you use
the burden of command?

01:18:28.485 --> 01:18:31.750
To make men into-
into, uh, chess pieces?

01:18:33.223 --> 01:18:36.021
- Yes.
- Hey, Yates.

01:18:36.093 --> 01:18:39.062
Why don't you do yourself
a favor and run along.

01:18:40.597 --> 01:18:43.327
Pawns.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.595
That prisoner
walking away, who is that?

01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:48.069
Uh, that's-That's Yates.

01:18:48.138 --> 01:18:52.234
He was an Apache pilot, but now
he's a lowlife- a hustler. He takes bets.

01:18:52.309 --> 01:18:54.675
- On what?
- Anything.

01:18:54.745 --> 01:18:57.111
Fights, the weather.

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:01.947
He even took bets on whether
Irwin was gonna kill himself.

01:19:19.236 --> 01:19:21.670
Ahhh.

01:19:26.577 --> 01:19:31.913
"This highly effective officer seems
to have no moral grounding whatsoever. "

01:19:33.383 --> 01:19:35.408
Is that so?

01:19:35.485 --> 01:19:38.454
Well, that's what men
better than me seem to think, sir.

01:19:40.457 --> 01:19:42.755
Why are you here, Yates?

01:19:42.826 --> 01:19:45.852
I would like your version.

01:19:45.929 --> 01:19:50.423
I was involved in a drug-smuggling
operation from Juarez to El Paso...

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.162
including several
of my subordinates, sir.

01:19:53.236 --> 01:19:55.204
You were "involved. "

01:19:55.272 --> 01:19:57.797
You ran it, did you not?

01:19:57.874 --> 01:20:00.104
Correct.

01:20:01.712 --> 01:20:06.308
Says here that you wore
a wire on your men.

01:20:06.383 --> 01:20:08.442
Is that correct?

01:20:08.518 --> 01:20:10.679
- Yeah.
- And how many years...

01:20:10.754 --> 01:20:14.281
did they take off
your sentence for... that?

01:20:14.358 --> 01:20:16.588
Four years, sir.

01:20:17.594 --> 01:20:19.755
And now you're the prison bookie.

01:20:22.633 --> 01:20:26.364
Tell me, Yates,
how does a man like you...

01:20:26.436 --> 01:20:28.802
get into West Point?

01:20:28.872 --> 01:20:32.035
My father was a winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor, sir.

01:20:33.243 --> 01:20:35.609
Oh, right.

01:20:39.383 --> 01:20:43.820
Well, sometimes the apple does fall
far from the tree.

01:20:43.887 --> 01:20:48.290
Your father-

01:20:48.358 --> 01:20:53.660
Your father was a POW
with Mr. Irwin, was he not?

01:20:58.735 --> 01:21:03.672
- Yes, that is correct. - And yet, you
haven't seen fit to join Mr. Irwin's-

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:07.972
- Crusade?
- Crusade.

01:21:08.045 --> 01:21:10.172
- Why is that?
- It's not my fight.

01:21:10.247 --> 01:21:13.683
Mr. Irwin is in a fight?

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:16.310
It says here
you have three years...

01:21:16.386 --> 01:21:18.854
left with us.

01:21:18.922 --> 01:21:21.447
- Correct?
- That's what it says.

01:21:21.525 --> 01:21:24.323
That's what it says.

01:21:25.595 --> 01:21:27.586
Does three months sound better?

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:34.364
I need to resolve
this situation... quickly...

01:21:34.438 --> 01:21:38.534
before someone else gets
hurt... or killed.

01:21:38.608 --> 01:21:42.476
- Do you agree?
- I guess.

01:21:42.546 --> 01:21:45.379
And the way I need to do that
is with information.

01:21:45.449 --> 01:21:49.351
So, you might want to rethink...

01:21:49.419 --> 01:21:53.480
your joining Mr. Irwin's...
crusade.

01:22:01.131 --> 01:22:03.622
You asking me to be
your snitch, sir?

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.567
Isn't it a little late in the game
to be self-righteous?

01:22:08.472 --> 01:22:11.600
- Dude, why I got to get my ass kicked?
- How many times you gonna ask?

01:22:11.675 --> 01:22:13.643
Stop your sniveling.
I'm only gonna hit you once.

01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:17.544
- Well, when?
- Now!

01:22:17.614 --> 01:22:19.047
Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:22:23.386 --> 01:22:26.321
Sit your tray down!

01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:29.886
Hey, fucker!

01:22:38.769 --> 01:22:42.102
Back off now!
I said back off now!

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.601
On your cans!

01:22:49.679 --> 01:22:51.613
Let's get on! Sit your asses down,
now! Let's go!

01:22:56.953 --> 01:23:00.480
You guys,
we don't have much time.

01:23:03.593 --> 01:23:07.029
We can no longer wear
the uniform of a soldier.

01:23:07.097 --> 01:23:09.088
We forfeited that right.

01:23:09.166 --> 01:23:12.294
And that includes me.

01:23:12.369 --> 01:23:14.633
I disobeyed an executive order.

01:23:14.704 --> 01:23:18.196
I violated my duty
as a commanding officer.

01:23:18.275 --> 01:23:22.837
And eight men paid
a catastrophic price.

01:23:22.913 --> 01:23:26.076
It's a mistake
not easy to live with.

01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:30.051
So, here I am, just like you,
a convicted criminal.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.580
The only difference between
you and me is I know I'm guilty.

01:23:36.927 --> 01:23:38.918
So we're packed away here
as prisoners.

01:23:41.198 --> 01:23:44.099
And one thing is certain.

01:23:44.167 --> 01:23:46.226
Our captors have the power.

01:23:46.303 --> 01:23:48.737
They can try to humiliate us.

01:23:48.805 --> 01:23:53.367
They can beat us. They can lock
us away in a dark hole for days on end.

01:23:53.443 --> 01:23:55.911
But there's one thing
they cannot do.

01:23:55.979 --> 01:23:59.676
They cannot take away from us
who we are.

01:23:59.749 --> 01:24:03.947
- And we are soldiers.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:07.888
It is the one thing- It is the one
thing that gives us a chance in here.

01:24:09.459 --> 01:24:11.654
And that nobody can ever take away.

01:24:11.728 --> 01:24:13.719
Yeah, that's right.

01:24:17.467 --> 01:24:20.197
The Uniform Code of Military Justice.

01:24:22.439 --> 01:24:26.375
"Grounds for Removal of a Stockade
or Disciplinary Barracks Commander:

01:24:26.443 --> 01:24:30.641
- "One. Dereliction of Duty. "
- That's right. Yeah.

01:24:30.714 --> 01:24:33.342
"Two. Criminal Malfeasance. "

01:24:33.416 --> 01:24:37.352
- "Three. Noncompliance with procedural rules. "
- Yeah.

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.389
"Four. Making false official statements. "

01:24:40.457 --> 01:24:44.689
"Five. Conduct unbecoming to an
officer and gentleman. "

01:24:44.761 --> 01:24:46.695
Yeah!

01:24:46.763 --> 01:24:50.859
"Six. Cruelty and maltreatment
of persons under his command. "

01:24:54.471 --> 01:24:56.462
"Seven.

01:24:56.539 --> 01:25:01.101
Command failure resulting
in loss of control of facility. "

01:25:02.579 --> 01:25:08.040
Gentlemen, I propose that we
seize control of this facility.

01:25:25.035 --> 01:25:27.503
Take a look
at a castle, any castle.

01:25:27.570 --> 01:25:30.368
Now, break down the elements
that make it a castle.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.878
Location. Protection. Garrison. Flag.

01:25:35.946 --> 01:25:38.039
The only difference between
this castle and all the rest...

01:25:38.114 --> 01:25:41.743
- is they were built to keep people out.
- Forward. Ho.

01:25:41.818 --> 01:25:44.616
This castle was built
to keep people in.

01:25:44.688 --> 01:25:46.952
But it's still a castle.

01:25:47.023 --> 01:25:52.256
And any castle can be taken, whether you're
fighting in the 14th century or the 21st.

01:25:53.763 --> 01:25:55.697
To succeed in a castle war,

01:25:55.765 --> 01:25:59.462
you have to overcome the garrison,

01:25:59.536 --> 01:26:02.130
take the high ground...

01:26:02.205 --> 01:26:04.765
and ultimately capture the flag.

01:26:04.841 --> 01:26:06.866
Okay? Enriquez.

01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:12.038
All right. You set up a command post, okay?

01:26:12.615 --> 01:26:14.549
And here, you have the guard- Well, here.

01:26:14.617 --> 01:26:16.778
First of all, this is admin building,

01:26:16.853 --> 01:26:19.879
Winter's office, guards.

01:26:19.956 --> 01:26:23.448
Okay? Phase one, neutralize Winter's guards.

01:26:23.526 --> 01:26:27.724
Phase two, towers. Control the towers,
you control the yard.

01:26:27.797 --> 01:26:30.857
Tower 1, Tower 2, Tower 3, Tower 4.

01:26:30.934 --> 01:26:33.835
Tower 4 is Zamorro-
guy to watch.

01:26:35.205 --> 01:26:37.230
Phase three, water cannon.

01:26:39.142 --> 01:26:42.009
Four, helicopter.

01:26:42.078 --> 01:26:45.104
Helicopter's the high ground.

01:26:45.181 --> 01:26:49.914
Takin' the helicopter's gonna
be a bitch. But it's doable.

01:26:49.986 --> 01:26:52.216
Finally, the flag.

01:26:53.857 --> 01:26:57.759
Capture the flag. When we capture
the flag, it's raised upside down.

01:26:57.827 --> 01:26:59.886
- Distress.
- Right.

01:27:01.297 --> 01:27:04.061
Right. Upside down means,

01:27:04.134 --> 01:27:06.932
"Send help. The fort has fallen. "

01:27:07.003 --> 01:27:10.871
We raise it upside down, and keep it that
way until Wheeler arrives and sees it.

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.874
Then, we've won.

01:27:12.942 --> 01:27:16.241
Yates, shut the fu-
You see what I mean about him?

01:27:16.312 --> 01:27:18.678
Hey, Yates, what are
you doin' here, huh?

01:27:18.748 --> 01:27:20.943
I don't know.
Ask him. He invited me.

01:27:21.017 --> 01:27:23.485
General, I know, uh, his father
served with you in Vietnam,

01:27:23.553 --> 01:27:26.317
but do we really need him around?

01:27:26.389 --> 01:27:28.323
Yeah. He stays.

01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:31.883
- Duffy? Are you in maintenance?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:39.269 --> 01:27:41.601
Yates.

01:27:41.671 --> 01:27:44.037
Got a minute?

01:27:45.041 --> 01:27:47.202
How am I doin'?

01:27:47.277 --> 01:27:49.507
Five-to-two,
in the colonel's favor.

01:27:51.114 --> 01:27:56.074
- Well, you don't think I can win.
- He knows too-

01:27:56.152 --> 01:27:59.610
He knows too much.
He's prepared. He's ready.

01:27:59.689 --> 01:28:02.624
He may be prepared,
but he's not ready.

01:28:02.692 --> 01:28:04.626
You know, we can use you.

01:28:04.694 --> 01:28:08.596
Hey, look, I just want
to survive this and go home.

01:28:08.665 --> 01:28:11.634
- You make a deal with him?
- What?

01:28:11.701 --> 01:28:14.067
That's what I would do.
Go to you.

01:28:14.137 --> 01:28:16.298
- He knows what you're capable of.
- Listen, man.

01:28:16.372 --> 01:28:19.535
- But so do I.
- Oh, yeah?

01:28:19.609 --> 01:28:21.839
Well, I know what you're capable of.

01:28:21.911 --> 01:28:24.709
- I know your type very well.
- Is that right?

01:28:24.781 --> 01:28:28.182
Is that from your infinite years
of experience on the battlefield?

01:28:28.251 --> 01:28:31.584
Why do you think I should help you?
Can you get me out of here?

01:28:31.654 --> 01:28:33.713
- No.
- Then what are you going to do for me?

01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:37.191
Oh, you're going to make me a soldier
again? Is that what you're doing?

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.785
I get to be all I can be?
You gonna teach me to salute?

01:28:39.863 --> 01:28:44.527
You know what? This is about the time I would
be giving you my internal soldier speech.

01:28:44.601 --> 01:28:49.061
But the truth is, you probably
never should have been a soldier.

01:28:49.139 --> 01:28:52.438
Your father was.
That's how I saw him.

01:28:52.509 --> 01:28:55.137
You saw him as a disappointment.
Okay. Get past it.

01:28:55.211 --> 01:28:58.612
That was then.
The only thing that matters here is...

01:28:58.681 --> 01:29:00.740
what we are now
and what we do now.

01:29:00.817 --> 01:29:03.285
This man is going to you
because he sees the worst in you.

01:29:03.353 --> 01:29:05.548
He's going to play for the worst.
I want to see the best.

01:29:05.622 --> 01:29:08.955
That means there's no middle.
Now, these men need you.

01:29:09.025 --> 01:29:13.485
And I need you.
Now, it's your choice.

01:29:13.563 --> 01:29:15.622
And don't tell me
you're surviving here, Yates.

01:29:15.698 --> 01:29:19.293
You're hiding.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.671
- How's it going this evening, sir?
- Fine, Sergeant. How are you?

01:29:27.744 --> 01:29:30.508
Sir?

01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:33.071
Prisoner Yates wishes to have a word.

01:29:35.618 --> 01:29:37.552
Give me five minutes, Captain.

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:42.421
Hi.

01:29:42.492 --> 01:29:45.655
Hi.

01:29:45.728 --> 01:29:47.821
Colonel Winter's office.

01:29:47.897 --> 01:29:50.058
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead
and just send it up.

01:29:54.404 --> 01:29:56.338
Sir.

01:29:56.406 --> 01:29:58.397
- Sir?
- Yes.

01:29:58.474 --> 01:30:00.874
Prisoner Yates.

01:30:05.114 --> 01:30:08.277
You want me to do this thing for you?

01:30:08.351 --> 01:30:12.549
This 30 days- This three months,
it's not gonna cut it.

01:30:12.622 --> 01:30:15.716
I got to get out of here immediately.
I got to get out of here tomorrow.

01:30:16.826 --> 01:30:18.760
I'm afraid that's not possible.

01:30:18.828 --> 01:30:23.788
Look, when this thing explodes,
everyone's gonna know it's me who yakked.

01:30:23.866 --> 01:30:25.800
And then my life's worth nothing.

01:30:25.868 --> 01:30:29.201
So, either you get me out
of here immediately...

01:30:29.272 --> 01:30:31.263
or you find another guy
who knows as much as I do...

01:30:31.341 --> 01:30:33.275
and who's willing to spill it.

01:30:33.343 --> 01:30:35.277
Good luck.

01:30:36.713 --> 01:30:39.273
The soonest I can get you out
is one week.

01:30:39.349 --> 01:30:41.283
Sir, I'm not gonna last-

01:30:41.351 --> 01:30:43.512
I won't last seven seconds
let alone seven days.

01:30:43.586 --> 01:30:45.747
Well, you can ride
the week out in the hole.

01:30:45.822 --> 01:30:47.949
No one will get you there.

01:30:51.628 --> 01:30:55.496
So what does Mr. Irwin
have planned for us?

01:30:55.565 --> 01:30:58.591
He's planning
to take over the prison.

01:30:58.668 --> 01:31:00.795
Really.

01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:03.202
Well, that information
won't get you released.

01:31:03.273 --> 01:31:06.674
That information won't even get
you extra potatoes at lunch.

01:31:06.743 --> 01:31:08.836
I know the details.

01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:11.471
I know how he plans
to neutralize your men,

01:31:11.547 --> 01:31:15.449
how he plans to take over the tower,
weapons and tools he's building.

01:31:18.321 --> 01:31:21.916
- Do you know when?
- Yates, I know you're in there!

01:31:21.991 --> 01:31:24.391
- Yates! Yates, I know you're in there!
- Cutbush!

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.020
You're a fucker, Yates!
You're gonna snitch!

01:31:27.096 --> 01:31:29.428
Cutbush, shut up!
Cutbush, get down!

01:31:29.499 --> 01:31:32.024
Shut up! Niebolt, what's he doing up here?

01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:34.695
- He brought up the laundry, and he went ape, sir.
- All right. Enough!

01:31:34.771 --> 01:31:37.706
Place this man in the SHU. No
one talks to him. No one sees him.

01:31:37.774 --> 01:31:39.867
- Understand me? Place a guard on his cell.
- Yes, sir!

01:31:39.942 --> 01:31:42.502
- Damn rat!
- What's the problem?

01:31:42.578 --> 01:31:44.876
My mother's sick.
I'm trying to get a furlough.

01:31:44.947 --> 01:31:46.915
- Shut up!
- Get him out of here!

01:31:46.983 --> 01:31:49.042
Captain, with me.

01:31:50.386 --> 01:31:54.288
Oh, Jesus, man.

01:31:54.357 --> 01:31:57.155
Now you have no choice,

01:31:57.226 --> 01:32:00.593
or you're going to spend the next
three years in solitary confinement.

01:32:00.663 --> 01:32:04.895
I need more time.

01:32:04.967 --> 01:32:07.697
I got to go back in to general.

01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:09.704
I'll know somethin' tomorrow.

01:32:09.772 --> 01:32:11.706
Come get me at 0500.

01:32:11.774 --> 01:32:14.868
I need more time!

01:32:15.078 --> 01:32:18.912
Inmates, one step to the rear.
March!

01:33:19.041 --> 01:33:20.975
- Sir?
- Where's Yates' cell?

01:33:21.043 --> 01:33:23.705
It's 340, sir.

01:33:30.787 --> 01:33:33.779
You ready to play?

01:33:33.856 --> 01:33:36.154
- Morning, sir.
- Fall out.

01:33:38.428 --> 01:33:40.521
Colonel?

01:33:41.864 --> 01:33:43.991
Colonel.

01:33:48.571 --> 01:33:53.333
Good morning.

01:33:55.611 --> 01:33:58.171
So, what do you have for me?

01:33:59.916 --> 01:34:03.647
- Not much.
- Not much.

01:34:06.689 --> 01:34:09.123
Then why are you here?

01:34:10.793 --> 01:34:15.093
I thought there was something
you might wanna know.

01:34:15.164 --> 01:34:18.691
When they take over the prison, they're
going to fly the flag upside down.

01:34:18.768 --> 01:34:22.363
- Upside down?
- It's the international sign of distress, sir.

01:34:22.438 --> 01:34:24.633
Yes, I know what it means.

01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:29.242
And where are they going to get a flag?

01:34:29.312 --> 01:34:32.543
They already have it. Yours.

01:34:32.615 --> 01:34:34.810
Mine.

01:34:44.994 --> 01:34:49.055
- Peretz, who was in here yesterday?
- I took it, you murdering fuck.

01:34:55.171 --> 01:34:57.105
I thought you were smarter than that.

01:34:57.173 --> 01:34:59.437
Yes, I know you did.

01:35:06.249 --> 01:35:08.513
You gonna tell us where that flag is?

01:35:09.685 --> 01:35:12.176
Come on. Get up, Yates.
Where's the flag?

01:35:14.824 --> 01:35:17.850
You know, you're
a real fuckin' coward, Zamorro.

01:35:17.927 --> 01:35:20.760
And you're a big hero.
Let's go. Come on.

01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:23.060
Get your hands off me,
motherfucker!

01:35:23.132 --> 01:35:25.123
Fuckin' prick!

01:35:26.135 --> 01:35:28.296
Shut up, Yates!

01:35:41.484 --> 01:35:44.920
All inmates on the rack.

01:35:44.987 --> 01:35:47.421
This is a shakedown.

01:35:47.490 --> 01:35:50.152
Go, go!

01:35:50.226 --> 01:35:53.127
Come on! Fall out!
Let's go!

01:35:53.195 --> 01:35:56.926
All inmates proceed to the yard
through the south ports.

01:36:03.039 --> 01:36:05.337
On the double! Move it!

01:36:05.408 --> 01:36:07.342
Come on. Go, go!

01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:17.410
- This way, chief.
- Let's go! Move it!

01:36:23.292 --> 01:36:25.487
Over there, sir.

01:36:25.561 --> 01:36:27.825
- It's crazy, huh?
- Let's go! Step it up!

01:36:27.897 --> 01:36:31.993
- Come on! Let's go! Move it, prisoners!
- Really crazy.

01:36:33.135 --> 01:36:35.103
- Go!
- All right!

01:36:44.146 --> 01:36:47.638
Captain Peretz, you will find my flag.

01:36:57.059 --> 01:37:01.559
6:10.

01:37:12.508 --> 01:37:14.874
I don't wanna hear that.
You have your orders.

01:37:14.944 --> 01:37:17.640
Find the damn thing.

01:37:17.713 --> 01:37:19.772
Sir, they found a lot of weaponry.

01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:23.045
- But no flag.
- No, sir.

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.554
But at least we have all their weapons.

01:37:26.622 --> 01:37:28.954
There's nothing much they can do now.

01:37:34.363 --> 01:37:37.332
How many men do we have searching the tiers?

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.858
We have close to a hundred.
Pretty much everybody we could get.

01:37:42.905 --> 01:37:46.898
It's not about the flag.
He wants to be in the yard.

01:37:46.976 --> 01:37:49.672
Get our men out of the tiers
and into the yard now.

01:37:49.745 --> 01:37:52.908
Everybody into the yard!

01:37:52.982 --> 01:37:56.816
Riot formation!
Let's go! Double time!

01:38:03.592 --> 01:38:06.425
Now!

01:38:08.497 --> 01:38:11.398
- Peretz! Get those men into the yard, now!
- Yes, sir!

01:38:11.467 --> 01:38:13.799
Alert the S.O.R.T. teams. Go, go!

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.464
Chain, chain, chain.

01:38:25.448 --> 01:38:26.972
All right.

01:38:30.986 --> 01:38:33.147
How's it feel, huh?
How's it feel?

01:38:33.222 --> 01:38:35.213
Bring him with us.

01:38:36.559 --> 01:38:39.153
To the hole!

01:38:40.696 --> 01:38:43.221
Command post up, fast!

01:38:51.874 --> 01:38:55.002
Put me down! You know
what's going to happen to you?

01:38:56.312 --> 01:38:58.803
- Go, go, go!
- Let us out!

01:38:58.881 --> 01:39:03.648
- Hey! Hey! Beaupre, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:39:03.719 --> 01:39:06.347
- Is it happening? Fuckin' "A" it's happening.
- Yeah.

01:39:09.925 --> 01:39:12.086
Damn it!

01:39:12.161 --> 01:39:14.857
They chained the doors to the tiers.

01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:17.797
Yes. I can see that.

01:39:17.867 --> 01:39:20.427
It's gonna take 'em
a little while to get around.

01:39:21.871 --> 01:39:25.204
When they get here, tell them
to gear up, but hold them.

01:39:25.274 --> 01:39:28.107
They'll expect us to come
hard and fast, so we won't.

01:39:28.177 --> 01:39:30.873
Whoa! Hey!

01:39:30.946 --> 01:39:34.780
Yates, you little prick. I bet against you
and it cost me a whole stash of smokes.

01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:37.444
Yeah? There's a lot of losers today.

01:39:45.795 --> 01:39:48.355
Go!

01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:53.231
- What's the deal?
- Come on, Zamorro, you motherfucker!

01:39:53.302 --> 01:39:56.294
Come on! Come on!
You fucking believe this guy?

01:39:56.372 --> 01:39:59.136
Okay, let's go.
Here we go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:39:59.208 --> 01:40:02.177
- Hey, get it out right now.
- Later, later.

01:40:08.317 --> 01:40:11.912
Listen to me. The colonel said
to hold them, okay?

01:40:11.987 --> 01:40:15.184
Hold them.

01:40:16.659 --> 01:40:20.356
Sir, maybe we should call C.A.C.
and get General Wheeler.

01:40:22.531 --> 01:40:24.863
And say what, Captain?

01:40:24.934 --> 01:40:27.334
Colonel Winter has lost control
of his own prison?

01:40:31.774 --> 01:40:34.937
- Keenan! Keenan, you ready to go up, man?
- Yes, sir!

01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:40.346
The trajectory is going to be there.

01:40:45.287 --> 01:40:48.051
Where do you want me?

01:40:48.123 --> 01:40:51.251
This is Sergeant McLaren
from Fort Truman Prison.

01:40:51.327 --> 01:40:54.490
Can I speak to General Wheeler?

01:40:54.563 --> 01:40:57.555
Well, you're gonna have to
wake the dude up, man.

01:40:57.633 --> 01:40:59.624
This is from Colonel Winter.

01:40:59.702 --> 01:41:01.693
We're having, like, an uprising here.

01:41:04.707 --> 01:41:07.437
Go. Launch when ready.

01:41:07.509 --> 01:41:09.704
Go, go, go! Come on!

01:41:12.481 --> 01:41:14.711
Light her up.
Light her up.

01:41:14.783 --> 01:41:17.308
Fire!

01:41:27.863 --> 01:41:32.596
Sir. Colonel, he wants to talk to you.

01:41:33.769 --> 01:41:36.932
- Who does?
- Him.

01:41:45.881 --> 01:41:47.872
Yes?

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:52.648
Colonel, I'm taking command
of your prison.

01:41:54.623 --> 01:41:56.921
Like hell you are.

01:42:00.729 --> 01:42:04.756
Come on, guys! Let's go! Stop fuckin'
around! We don't got much time!

01:42:04.833 --> 01:42:07.768
- Let's go! Come on, let's go!
- Dellwo.

01:42:07.836 --> 01:42:10.100
- Sir?
- How close to ready?

01:42:10.172 --> 01:42:12.265
Fuck! We're almost there, sir.

01:42:12.341 --> 01:42:15.333
Sir, could-could you
come here, please?

01:42:22.318 --> 01:42:27.017
What-What is that? That thing right
there tucked away in the alley.

01:42:27.089 --> 01:42:29.649
I don't know.

01:42:36.265 --> 01:42:39.826
Release the wave.

01:42:41.971 --> 01:42:44.496
Come on, come on!
Get it up!

01:43:09.498 --> 01:43:12.729
Go ahead and deploy
red and blue teams.

01:43:13.102 --> 01:43:14.899
Let's go!

01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:17.905
Let's go. Come on! Move!

01:43:23.946 --> 01:43:25.504
Defend!

01:43:39.028 --> 01:43:42.896
Lock and load the fucking thing now!

01:43:43.966 --> 01:43:46.560
Take it up, take it up.
Light her!

01:43:46.635 --> 01:43:49.103
Fire!

01:43:51.173 --> 01:43:54.040
Gun! Bring me the gun!
Bring me the gun!

01:43:57.713 --> 01:44:00.375
Bring it! Bring it!
Let's go! Come on!

01:44:00.449 --> 01:44:02.610
Load her up. Load her up.
Charlie, you ready?

01:44:02.684 --> 01:44:05.244
- Set!
- Clear! Fire!

01:44:07.723 --> 01:44:10.487
Fuck me!
It worked, man!

01:44:12.461 --> 01:44:14.759
Fire!

01:44:24.073 --> 01:44:26.906
Mr. Dellwo.

01:44:26.975 --> 01:44:29.443
- Sir?
- Move ten feet forward.

01:44:29.511 --> 01:44:32.674
Yes, sir.
Ten feet forward!

01:44:32.748 --> 01:44:35.342
Ten feet forward!

01:44:38.387 --> 01:44:41.515
- Zamorro, target the man loading rocks into the trebuchet.
- McLaren?

01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:43.820
Do not let him put another one in.

01:44:43.892 --> 01:44:45.860
Dellwo, you gonna make it this time?

01:44:45.928 --> 01:44:50.490
- You betcha, sir.
- Then now is the time.

01:44:50.566 --> 01:44:52.830
All the way, sir!
Airborne! Hey, Jack!

01:44:52.901 --> 01:44:55.461
- What?
- This is the one! Get it!

01:44:55.537 --> 01:44:58.335
Come on. No, no, no, no.
This one in the middle.

01:45:00.509 --> 01:45:03.603
- Come on, baby.
- Fire!

01:45:26.301 --> 01:45:28.735
- Fire!
- Sir!

01:45:44.052 --> 01:45:47.988
Come on! Come on! Hold it there!
Let's go! Get it in there! Last one!

01:45:48.056 --> 01:45:50.889
Make it count! Make it-

01:45:59.168 --> 01:46:01.728
- Be still!
- Put it out! Put it out!

01:46:04.239 --> 01:46:07.037
- Hey, hey! It's out!
- You never can tell about these flames, man.

01:46:09.845 --> 01:46:12.746
Told you I was gonna get your ass
back, motherfucker.

01:46:12.814 --> 01:46:15.374
Sir.

01:46:17.519 --> 01:46:19.680
Sir.

01:46:21.623 --> 01:46:23.784
Watch the window.

01:46:34.102 --> 01:46:36.434
Get that water cannon now.

01:46:41.410 --> 01:46:46.973
- Duffy. Duffy?
- Uh, just a few more minutes, sir.

01:46:47.049 --> 01:46:51.383
Fall back! Fall back!

01:46:51.453 --> 01:46:54.650
All personnel, fall back!
Come on! Faster!

01:47:06.868 --> 01:47:09.428
Come on, Duffy.
What are you doing? Cut it off.

01:47:09.504 --> 01:47:12.439
Keep it going!

01:47:12.507 --> 01:47:16.603
Let's shift to the C.P.!
Shift to the C.P.! Now! Go!

01:47:48.243 --> 01:47:50.643
Duffy, what are you doing?

01:47:55.984 --> 01:47:58.418
Ha! Yes!

01:48:00.622 --> 01:48:03.489
Charge!

01:48:03.558 --> 01:48:06.584
Shit!

01:48:22.744 --> 01:48:25.542
- Whoo!
- You coward motherfucker, Winter!

01:48:25.614 --> 01:48:28.378
Colonel, it's your private line.

01:48:28.450 --> 01:48:32.216
- Get it.
- U.S.M.C.F. Colonel Winter's office.

01:48:33.288 --> 01:48:35.552
Uh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Please hold.

01:48:35.624 --> 01:48:37.854
It's General Wheeler.

01:48:40.462 --> 01:48:43.295
We're on our way, Colonel.
There in 20 minutes.

01:48:43.365 --> 01:48:45.299
I don't understand, sir.

01:48:45.367 --> 01:48:48.302
You have a prison uprising.
You sent for help.

01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:50.463
No, no. I nev-

01:48:52.808 --> 01:48:54.901
We have the situation under control, sir.

01:48:54.976 --> 01:48:59.504
- We're just... mopping up now.
- Good.

01:48:59.581 --> 01:49:02.175
Glad to hear it. We'll see you in 20 then.

01:49:05.153 --> 01:49:07.314
Very good, sir.

01:49:15.931 --> 01:49:18.764
I want this over. Now.
Get them airborne.

01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.307
Okay.

01:49:43.625 --> 01:49:45.957
Aah!

01:49:47.729 --> 01:49:51.460
- Load the water cannon.
- Go, go! Come on, man!

01:50:01.076 --> 01:50:03.340
All right,
give me the grapple!

01:50:03.412 --> 01:50:06.347
Hurry up! Hook it on!

01:50:08.817 --> 01:50:10.341
Where's the fuckin' water?

01:50:21.496 --> 01:50:23.862
Now.

01:50:43.585 --> 01:50:46.145
We're hooked!

01:50:51.693 --> 01:50:56.289
- Sir, I think that's Yates.
- Yes, I know.

01:51:02.237 --> 01:51:05.206
Hold on!

01:51:24.926 --> 01:51:27.326
Where is he?

01:51:36.004 --> 01:51:38.495
Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

01:51:57.959 --> 01:52:01.759
Get this guy out!
Clear out. I'm going up.

01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:06.961
Zamorro, take him out.
Stop him! Stop him!

01:52:22.817 --> 01:52:26.878
To hell with this rubber-bullet shit.

01:52:46.808 --> 01:52:48.742
Come on! Come on!

01:53:21.409 --> 01:53:23.673
Come on.

01:53:23.745 --> 01:53:25.975
Oh, no.

01:53:27.082 --> 01:53:29.414
I never wrecked one before.

01:53:29.484 --> 01:53:32.248
Don't talk. Go.
Move. Go!

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:35.050
Get out! Go!

01:54:13.995 --> 01:54:15.963
You okay, Yates?

01:54:17.465 --> 01:54:19.626
Let's go.

01:54:50.832 --> 01:54:53.562
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:57.137
Fall in! Let's go, men!

01:54:57.205 --> 01:55:00.140
In formation, now!
On the double!

01:55:00.208 --> 01:55:02.267
Let's go, soldiers! Now!

01:55:03.778 --> 01:55:05.905
Let's go!

01:55:10.719 --> 01:55:14.621
Dress right! Dress!

01:55:21.629 --> 01:55:24.496
Ready... front!

01:55:26.634 --> 01:55:29.102
Cover!

01:55:40.315 --> 01:55:42.977
The men are assembled, sir.

01:56:33.601 --> 01:56:35.535
First and second squad,
move out.

01:56:35.603 --> 01:56:37.969
Third and fourth squad,
move out.

01:57:16.778 --> 01:57:20.270
I have authorized the use
of lethal ammunition at this facility.

01:57:20.348 --> 01:57:25.285
Any prisoner who refuses to obey
my commands will be shot.

01:57:36.531 --> 01:57:40.092
All prisoners
down on the ground, now!

01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:01.755
I will give that command
one more time.

01:58:01.823 --> 01:58:03.814
Then I will fire into them.

01:58:05.526 --> 01:58:09.326
Surely, you don't want that on your
conscience, do you, Prisoner Irwin?

01:58:16.671 --> 01:58:20.072
All prisoners
down on the ground, now!

01:58:39.394 --> 01:58:41.453
Wait.

01:58:49.237 --> 01:58:51.398
We don't have to do this.
We'll fight on.

01:58:51.472 --> 01:58:54.532
No. It ends here.

01:59:01.482 --> 01:59:04.144
Men, get down!

01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:28.272
You, too, Yates.

01:59:32.947 --> 01:59:35.211
That's an order.

01:59:56.971 --> 02:00:00.372
Now, give me my flag.

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:07.573
It's not your flag.

02:00:16.124 --> 02:00:19.616
What are you doing, Mr. Irwin?

02:00:19.694 --> 02:00:22.026
You have lost.

02:00:22.096 --> 02:00:26.123
I will not let you do this. You will
not raise that flag upside down!

02:00:27.602 --> 02:00:30.093
Get down on the ground
or you will be fired upon.

02:00:30.171 --> 02:00:34.665
This is my command! You
will not raise that flag upside down!

02:00:34.742 --> 02:00:38.576
Designated marksman, open fire.

02:00:49.590 --> 02:00:53.822
Selected marksman, open fire.

02:01:00.601 --> 02:01:03.536
Open fire on that man!
That's an order!

02:01:09.544 --> 02:01:11.705
What are they-
What are they doing?

02:01:11.779 --> 02:01:14.441
What are you doing?
Do it now! Open fire!

02:01:14.515 --> 02:01:20.181
Do not let him desecrate that flag!
Open fire on that man!

02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:27.387
What are they doing?

02:01:27.462 --> 02:01:31.523
- McLaren, Niebolt, with me!
- Niebolt, stay where you are.

02:01:34.569 --> 02:01:38.665
Don't you defy me. Don't you see what
he's doing? He's undermining my command!

02:01:38.739 --> 02:01:42.539
Don't you see?
Don't you see what he's doing?

02:01:42.610 --> 02:01:45.204
Don't you see what he's doing?

02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:56.348
Step away from the flag!
Step away from the flag!

02:02:03.798 --> 02:02:08.531
Colonel! Colonel, put the gun down, sir.

02:02:10.972 --> 02:02:16.205
Please. Please, Colonel, put the gun down.

02:02:16.277 --> 02:02:18.472
Colonel.

02:02:25.186 --> 02:02:27.177
Sir, it's over now.

02:02:28.256 --> 02:02:30.724
Just give it to me.

02:02:40.434 --> 02:02:43.870
Prisoners stay down.

02:02:45.439 --> 02:02:47.964
- Hey, Doc!
- Go now!

02:02:48.042 --> 02:02:50.408
McLaren, get 'em back in the tiers.

02:02:50.478 --> 02:02:53.174
"A" team, "B" team, move out now.

02:02:56.017 --> 02:02:58.577
Let's go!
Hands behind your head!

02:02:58.653 --> 02:03:01.383
All right! On your feet!

02:03:03.991 --> 02:03:07.051
Let's go, people.
Hands behind your head.

02:03:13.534 --> 02:03:15.764
Prisoners will
return to the cellblock.

02:03:24.979 --> 02:03:27.140
- Come on, Doc.
- He's bleeding.

02:03:27.215 --> 02:03:30.048
- We got an ambulance on the way.
- Get him to the hospital.

02:04:53.934 --> 02:04:56.664
A great general once said,

02:04:58.172 --> 02:05:00.606
"You tell your men,
'You're soldiers.

02:05:00.675 --> 02:05:03.542
"That's our flag.'

02:05:03.611 --> 02:05:06.774
"You tell them,
'Nobody takes our flag.'

02:05:06.847 --> 02:05:10.339
"Raise your flag so it flies high
where everyone can see it.

02:05:13.688 --> 02:05:16.623
Now you've got yourself a castle."

02:07:57.318 --> 02:08:02.051
Where the years have gone
I have years to go

02:08:06.193 --> 02:08:10.095
Workin' for the man
to pay the debt I owe

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:18.097
Well, the time may pass
but the truth will stand

02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:25.702
When the good Lord
shakes this calloused hand

02:08:28.682 --> 02:08:31.879
You can call my name
It's time to go

02:08:31.952 --> 02:08:36.616
But I'll never be free
till it's chiseled in stone

02:08:40.628 --> 02:08:43.961
Ain't no man gonna carry my load

02:08:46.534 --> 02:08:49.799
I gotta be a man and do it on my own

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:56.201
Devil's in my path
and the hound's on my heel

02:08:58.312 --> 02:09:02.146
Have to walk in my shoes
just to know how I feel

02:09:04.251 --> 02:09:07.414
The devil's callin' my name
He's the one who knows

02:09:07.488 --> 02:09:12.187
That I'll never be free
till it's chiseled in stone

02:09:12.259 --> 02:09:14.819
Chiseled in stone

02:09:33.447 --> 02:09:37.440
Well, I keep on goin'
though there's no way out

02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:43.784
Every stone in my path
is a brick in my house

02:09:45.559 --> 02:09:49.290
A man's life is built
all along the way

02:09:51.632 --> 02:09:55.466
By the things that he's done
and the choices he's made

02:09:57.571 --> 02:10:00.665
Someday they'll call my name
I'll have a place of my own

02:10:00.741 --> 02:10:04.973
But I'll never be free
till it's chiseled in stone

02:10:08.916 --> 02:10:12.977
On the final day
when the whistle blows

02:10:14.822 --> 02:10:19.316
I can rest my body
I can rest my soul

02:10:21.195 --> 02:10:24.528
I built my castle
in the promised land

02:10:26.934 --> 02:10:31.303
It's made of rocks and stone
and like the shifting sands

02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:35.966
When they mention my name
after I'm long gone

02:10:36.043 --> 02:10:40.104
Well, they'll know I'm free
'cause it's chiseled in stone

02:10:43.784 --> 02:10:46.685
Chiseled in stone
