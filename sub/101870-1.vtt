01:58.720 --> 02:00.454
Can I get an espresso, please?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.891
Thank you very much.

02:08.663 --> 02:10.598
Hello, no,
it's delicious. Thank you.

02:28.650 --> 02:29.517
Oh, my God!

02:30.317 --> 02:32.419
Hey!
Oh, it's so good to see you.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.522
- I know.
- I didn't know you're in town.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.690
Oh, yeah,
just for a couple weeks.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.424
And I have a few minutes.
Can I sit down?

02:37.457 --> 02:38.358
Oh, yeah, please.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.896
I feel like I haven't seen you
in forever. How's life?

02:41.929 --> 02:45.399
It's good, um, life is good.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.536
Were you as not ready
to graduate as I was?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.838
Oh, my gosh, no, it flew by.

02:50.872 --> 02:54.474
Yeah, but knowing you, you already have a
five-step plan for conquering the world.

02:54.509 --> 02:55.777
What are you up to?

02:55.810 --> 02:57.712
Um, no, I...

02:57.745 --> 03:01.448
I'm waiting to hear back from a, uh,
journalism fellowship in New York.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.818
Oh, which one?
I have a friend with the <i>Times</i>.

03:03.851 --> 03:09.524
Oh, wow. No.
Um, it's called <i>LifeStars</i>.

03:10.692 --> 03:11.959
You probably
haven't heard of it.

03:11.993 --> 03:16.631
It's, um,
it's an online publication.

03:17.999 --> 03:20.400
I'm probably not gonna get it,
anyway.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.438
No, I mean, you will be running
that place in less than a year.

03:25.305 --> 03:30.444
Um, what about you, though?

03:30.477 --> 03:32.379
You're, uh,
you're going to London?

03:32.412 --> 03:34.481
You have a coding job or something?
I saw on Facebook.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.684
Yeah, complex systems analysis.

03:36.718 --> 03:41.254
It's... it's with a startup but I'm
so excited, but absolutely terrifying.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.624
No, that's... that's incredible.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.393
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.494
Yeah, okay.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.896
I feel bad
we haven't kept in touch.

03:48.930 --> 03:49.897
Yeah, I know. I'm so sorry.

03:49.931 --> 03:52.432
No, it's not your fault.
We've both been bad.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.803
Yeah. But we'll have to fix that and we
have to hang out before I leave, okay?

03:56.470 --> 03:58.639
- Yes, definitely. I'll text you.
- Bye.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.631
Hi, uh,
can I get a large popcorn

04:56.664 --> 05:00.535
and a little bitchboy who won't leave
early every time we go out, please?

05:00.568 --> 05:02.335
I told you I had to work early.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.905
Dude, you missed it.

05:03.938 --> 05:06.541
That party was off the chain,
okay?

05:06.574 --> 05:07.775
Are people still saying that?

05:07.809 --> 05:09.376
I mean, high schoolers do.

05:09.844 --> 05:11.546
Them kids go hard, okay?

05:12.613 --> 05:14.549
Can't get emphasis on kids.

05:15.016 --> 05:17.484
Yo, did you see Tasha Hendrix
last night?

05:17.518 --> 05:20.521
- Oh, my God, that body just looks so...
- Seventeen.

05:21.923 --> 05:23.724
I mean, yeah.
But did you see her?

05:23.758 --> 05:25.693
You're so gross.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.662
Oh, come on, dude. I mean...

05:27.695 --> 05:31.566
Okay, five years is not that big
of an age difference, right?

05:31.599 --> 05:32.600
I mean how far apart
are your parents?

05:32.633 --> 05:33.634
Exactly the same age.

05:33.668 --> 05:36.504
We've literally had
this conversation before.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.404
Really?

05:37.905 --> 05:38.973
Damn.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.407
They look good.

05:43.044 --> 05:45.847
Yo, did you hear that Bradley
is moving to Austin too?

05:45.880 --> 05:46.747
No way!

05:47.882 --> 05:48.916
Totally forgot about that guy.

05:48.950 --> 05:51.118
Yeah, probably because
he stopped doing parties.

05:51.152 --> 05:55.056
- Yeah, well I don't blame him after how the last one ended.
- Oh, true.

05:55.089 --> 05:59.126
Yo, why haven't we given your sister
more shit about that?

05:59.160 --> 06:02.029
I wouldn't do that, dude.
She's still pretty butthurt over it.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.533
Come on,
that was four years ago.

06:05.967 --> 06:08.603
Yeah, it was probably
the worst night of my life.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.539
Dude, it's one
of the coolest things about you.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.373
No, it was not cool.

06:14.976 --> 06:16.978
You should have seen my dad's face when
he picked me up at the police station.

06:17.011 --> 06:18.646
It was a nightmare.

06:18.679 --> 06:22.950
Well, on the bright side, you're over 21
now, so clubs won't really be an issue.

06:22.984 --> 06:26.687
I know. It's just that was right
after high school graduation

06:26.721 --> 06:29.523
and if right after college
graduation, I do the same thing,

06:29.557 --> 06:32.894
I just get trashed again, it's like
I didn't learn my lesson, you know?

06:32.927 --> 06:36.964
Don't give me that symbolic shit.
We're celebrating.

06:36.998 --> 06:38.666
I'm sure Barbara
will get trash with me.

06:40.134 --> 06:41.869
I would not count on that.

06:44.005 --> 06:45.973
You don't mind
that I invited her, do you?

06:46.007 --> 06:48.509
Oh, no, not at all.
More the merrier.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.811
Plus, childhood friends
say a lot about a person.

06:51.646 --> 06:54.715
Oh, yeah? Did you learn that in the
one psych class you actually went to?

06:55.116 --> 06:56.449
Ha-ha.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.057
It was kind of weird to see her again.
It's just been so long.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.426
That's what happens.
Distance makes distance.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.698
- Deep.
- Yeah, I thought so.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.639
This is her neighborhood.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.075
How's <i>Stepford Wives</i>?

07:40.962 --> 07:43.164
- Hey, Fran.
- Hey.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.634
- Hey, you must be Lauren.
- Yeah. I've heard so much about you.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.902
Sorry, I claimed shotgun.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.070
Oh, don't worry about it.

07:49.103 --> 07:50.938
We can swap seats at Marcos.

07:50.972 --> 07:54.208
Yes, Marcos.
Is that place still even open?

07:54.241 --> 07:56.043
I don't know,
I guess we'll find out.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.479
Point is, I had a good time.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.850
You always have a good time.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.618
Thanks.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.987
into a movie?

08:07.154 --> 08:07.989
Nope.

08:08.022 --> 08:10.758
- Why not?
- Manager's cracking down.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.893
- Weak shit, dude.
- Alright.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.696
Hey, remember,
we're leaving early tomorrow.

08:15.730 --> 08:17.531
- How early?
- Real early.

08:22.203 --> 08:24.739
So, what exactly
is outdoor education?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.240
I'm so glad you asked.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.943
Okay, so you know, in middle school
when you would go to those big parks

08:28.976 --> 08:31.178
- with high ropes and obstacles and stuff?
- Yeah.

08:31.212 --> 08:35.249
And by the end, you'd overcome
some tough obstacle as a team

08:35.282 --> 08:39.553
in an enriching and natural way led
by a team of fun and hip counselors?

08:39.587 --> 08:41.355
Sure.

08:41.389 --> 08:46.127
Well, you are talking to the hippest and funnest
new member of Colorado Springs Outbacks.

08:48.062 --> 08:51.198
It's camp. She's a glorified
camp counselor.

08:52.099 --> 08:56.804
An outdoor educator at an
outdoor education facility.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.128
Is that it?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.730
No, that's the guest house.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.199
We never really used it much.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.334
Is somebody living there?

10:01.035 --> 10:02.504
I don't know.

10:02.537 --> 10:04.972
My parents have been trying to sell
it forever. Maybe they finally did.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.828
Ah, here we are.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.665
It smells the exact same.

10:32.366 --> 10:33.934
Oh, this place is creepy.

10:34.301 --> 10:38.105
Hey, nana was eccentric.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.410
When was the last time
you guys came up here?

10:43.444 --> 10:47.715
Um, ninth, maybe tenth grade.
I don't know.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.717
But Hal and I used to bring
friends up here like every summer.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.886
And still think
this place is creepy?

10:51.919 --> 10:54.054
My friends,
you mean me and Terry.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.923
Remember that one time
when we tried to bring Anna?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.892
- My God, that was a nightmare.
- Yeah.

11:02.463 --> 11:03.397
Hal?

11:09.670 --> 11:12.106
- Yo, what up Fran, Fran?
- What the hell are you guys doing here?

11:13.073 --> 11:14.275
What are you doing here?

11:14.308 --> 11:15.342
Spending a weekend
with my friends.

11:15.376 --> 11:18.379
Well, I'll be darned,
I guess we double bugged.

11:18.412 --> 11:20.681
No, Hal, you guys cannot stay here.

11:21.182 --> 11:22.750
We're not leaving.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.319
Hal, I've been planning
this trip for ages.

11:27.087 --> 11:27.955
Uh...

11:29.123 --> 11:31.825
Okay, okay, look, relax,
Francis the Radio.

11:32.293 --> 11:33.494
How do you know Hal?

11:33.528 --> 11:35.896
He visited Francis,
sophomore year.

11:35.930 --> 11:37.831
I... I don't know,
he seems pretty cool.

11:37.865 --> 11:41.735
Yeah, but when he and Terry get
together, they can kind of be a lot.

11:42.504 --> 11:43.871
I brought sparklers.

11:49.310 --> 11:52.780
Yo, Francis the Radio.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.316
- You saw what I did there? That's good, okay.
- Kind of...

11:55.349 --> 11:56.450
What's the deal?

11:56.483 --> 11:57.818
They're staying.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.060
- Hey, Barb.
- Hal, hey.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.861
You must be Lauren.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.097
And you must be
the infamous Terry.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.198
They call me T-unit.

12:11.232 --> 12:13.167
Yeah. No one calls him T-unit.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.802
Hey, Lauren.

12:14.835 --> 12:15.970
Hey, Hal.

12:17.505 --> 12:22.544
Uh, I'm sorry to rain on your guys'
parade or Francis' parade, at least.

12:22.577 --> 12:26.347
Uh, she'll cool off. It might help if you
guys don't pull shit like that though.

12:27.982 --> 12:30.351
- Fair.
- I'm gonna go check on her.

12:30.384 --> 12:31.919
Yeah, good call.

12:40.494 --> 12:41.895
Can you believe him?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.464
Francis,
it's totally not a big deal.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.199
No, I mean,
first, they show up here

12:45.232 --> 12:47.001
and then they pull that
stupid thing with the masks.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.969
Yeah, but come on,
that was nothing new.

12:49.003 --> 12:51.272
Yeah. Well, you would have thought
that they would have grown up by now.

12:51.305 --> 12:54.008
Francis, look, you've...
Calm down, okay? Just look at me.

12:54.041 --> 12:57.978
No, I know, it's just annoying because I
had this whole plan for the weekend and...

12:58.012 --> 13:00.948
Now it's gonna be a little
different and that's okay, right?

13:01.315 --> 13:04.251
Look, you can either be upset
about it and sulk away the weekend

13:04.285 --> 13:08.422
or you can try to be nice and maybe
we'll end up having a great time.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.691
I doubt that.

13:09.724 --> 13:12.359
Come on, didn't you guys say you
came here all the time together?

13:12.393 --> 13:14.061
Yeah, when we were kids.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.263
And it was kind of fun,
wasn't it, Barb?

13:17.865 --> 13:19.300
I mean, come on,
we had a good time.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.068
Francis.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.872
- Yeah, we had fun.
- Look, there you go, problem solved.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.809
I am excited to be back.

13:29.443 --> 13:31.979
Ooh Barb, we have to go camping
at Black Ridge Rock.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.013
Oh, mm-hmm.

13:33.047 --> 13:35.149
And, Lauren, you can teach
everyone along the way

13:35.182 --> 13:37.251
about everything you learned
in your botany class.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.086
Okay, you know what,
that class was awesome

13:39.119 --> 13:41.121
and I'll have you know
that tree identification

13:41.155 --> 13:43.324
is the most important part
of conservation.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.027
- Did you just pick that up or...
- No, actually it was our motto.

13:47.061 --> 13:48.329
We all got it tattooed
on our butts.

13:48.362 --> 13:49.564
- Barb, do you want to see?
- No, Ma'am.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.067
Alright, I'm gonna go check out the house.
You wanna come?

13:53.535 --> 13:55.302
Uh, no, I'll be down in a sec.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.409
I'm really glad you're here.

14:03.444 --> 14:05.613
- Yeah, thanks for inviting me.
- Yeah, of course.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.147
I'm sorry
about all of the drama.

14:07.181 --> 14:10.317
I was really looking forward to you
and Lauren getting to know each other.

14:11.519 --> 14:14.221
Sorry. Um, one second.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.292
Uh, email sent.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.462
Okay. Okay, don't worry about it.
It's fine.

14:22.096 --> 14:24.098
Hey, have you heard back
from that website yet?

14:24.498 --> 14:28.235
Oh, um, no, I haven't.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.437
But I'm sure
I'll hear something soon.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.075
Hey, I have something
to show you.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.581
Oh, my God!

14:39.614 --> 14:41.915
- The power bands.
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

14:42.416 --> 14:45.185
Though they are definitely a lot
less stylish than I remember.

14:45.219 --> 14:48.188
- Um, ouch, I worked really hard on these.
- Uh, okay.

14:49.858 --> 14:52.926
Plus, I think it was less about the
appearance and more about the superpowers.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.697
Oh, gosh, yeah, what did they give us?
They gave us immunity to...

14:55.730 --> 14:59.567
We were immune to hypnosis and
we could read each other's minds.

14:59.601 --> 15:01.435
- Well, you think they still work?
- Um, yeah, let's try it.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.203
Okay.

15:04.672 --> 15:09.977
You are thinking, "What the hell
did I get myself into this weekend?"

15:10.010 --> 15:12.079
Uncanny.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.617
But for real,
I really am glad to be back.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.184
Me, too.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.487
Oh, my gosh, I remember this one time I
tried to show them to Karen Salvenkin.

15:20.522 --> 15:21.422
I was trying to impress her.

15:21.455 --> 15:22.624
- You did?
- Yep.

15:22.657 --> 15:25.693
Didn't work at all.
So embarrassing.

15:25.727 --> 15:27.961
God, we're so dumb.

15:29.731 --> 15:31.131
Yeah, we were.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.067
- Do you remember that time...
- Oh, my God!

15:34.101 --> 15:35.369
What?

15:35.402 --> 15:38.338
- I got that apartment in London that I wanted.
- Oh, my gosh!

15:38.372 --> 15:41.676
Oh, my gosh, this place is beautiful
and the location is just perfect.

15:41.709 --> 15:44.144
Sorry, I have to text Mia.
She's gonna flip.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.953
So that's Lauren, huh?

15:54.455 --> 15:56.558
- Yep.
- She seems alright.

15:56.591 --> 15:58.492
- Just alright?
- Yeah, just alright.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.795
Yo, Hal, listen.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.765
You never got to fully experience how
fine some of these college girls are.

16:03.798 --> 16:05.232
Whatever.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.267
She is awesome though.

16:07.735 --> 16:10.437
- Alright. Hey, who you texting?
- Nobody.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.307
Yeah, I'm gonna get another beer.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.374
- Do you want one?
- Yeah.

16:14.408 --> 16:15.275
Okay.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.585
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

16:23.618 --> 16:24.719
Nothing.

16:24.752 --> 16:26.554
- Just getting settled.
- Mm-hm.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.089
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

16:33.761 --> 16:36.230
Cheers.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.137
So, uh, do you guys have plans?

16:44.171 --> 16:46.039
Knowing Francis, probably.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.207
You guys?

16:47.241 --> 16:50.244
- Rarely.
- Yo, look what I found.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.713
Oh, my God, is that beans?

16:51.746 --> 16:53.146
- Yeah.
- What's beans?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.817
Oh, it's this game we used to play
all the time when we came up here.

16:55.850 --> 16:57.585
So much fun.

16:57.619 --> 16:59.787
- Where did you find that?
- In one of these boxes.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.690
God, I can't believe
mama's gonna give that away.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.025
I bet there's a bunch
of cool shit up here.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.633
What's with all these books?

17:11.666 --> 17:14.636
Oh, nana was really
into the supernatural.

17:14.669 --> 17:20.374
There's a bunch of, uh, local lore in this
area, disappearances, stuff like that.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.174
Jeez.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.412
Oh, my God,
is that you and nana?

17:25.445 --> 17:27.080
Yeah.

17:27.114 --> 17:30.083
Oh, you guys think
these pickles are still good?

17:30.450 --> 17:31.686
Definitely not.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.024
What are you guys doing?

17:36.056 --> 17:36.891
Oh, Frannie,
come check it out.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.325
There's a bunch of cool stuff
in here.

17:39.894 --> 17:41.796
Yo, guys,
come and take a look at this.

17:41.829 --> 17:43.363
Oh, my God.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.732
Look at this.

17:44.766 --> 17:46.734
Oh, that must have been
from our first summer.

17:56.778 --> 17:58.211
What is this?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.682
Oh, you found Little Babs.

18:00.715 --> 18:02.517
Little Babs?

18:02.550 --> 18:04.552
Nana got it
at a local pawn shop.

18:04.586 --> 18:07.287
She thought it protected
the house against evil spirits.

18:07.321 --> 18:09.289
And she called it Little Babs?

18:09.323 --> 18:12.359
No, no, no, no, we called it Little Babs.
She hated that.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.596
It's disrespectful
to the spirits.

18:14.629 --> 18:16.263
Oh, my God,
please be careful with that.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.332
Yeah, yeah, Terry, we don't
want to unleash anything.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.902
Nana was convinced that the house was haunted.

18:20.935 --> 18:23.738
Now, did she actually believe that
or did she just want to scare Barb?

18:23.771 --> 18:26.273
God, I wasn't scared.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.577
Yeah, that's why we had to keep that thing
next to your bed anytime you were here.

18:29.611 --> 18:32.145
- You know what?
- I mean, that's legit.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.315
What?

18:35.783 --> 18:37.250
Guys, spirits are real.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.622
My cousin's clairvoyant and
she talks to them all the time.

18:40.655 --> 18:43.190
I did not know you were
one of those people.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.492
Yeah, I had no idea
that you were superstitious.

18:45.526 --> 18:49.864
Okay, I'm not superstitious,
I am just open to possibilities.

18:49.897 --> 18:52.466
Oh, well,
then you are going to love this.

18:52.499 --> 18:56.504
Have you ever heard the story
of the <i>Lost Children</i>?

18:56.537 --> 18:59.473
Oh, no.

18:59.507 --> 19:01.009
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.

19:01.042 --> 19:04.646
Only the origin of every subsequent
paranormal occurrence in the nearby area.

19:04.679 --> 19:09.383
No, it's a local legend that our nana told us
that he had way too much fun with as a kid.

19:09.416 --> 19:13.655
Legend, or forgotten history.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.691
Legend.

19:16.724 --> 19:18.392
Everybody gather round,

19:18.425 --> 19:25.867
the time has come to tell the tale of the
four lost children of Black Ridge Rock.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.636
Ooh, you gonna love this.

19:29.971 --> 19:30.838
Psst!

19:31.873 --> 19:32.907
What?

19:33.574 --> 19:35.610
I have a tale to tell, so...

19:35.643 --> 19:36.944
Hey, can you sit down?

19:36.978 --> 19:39.681
- Okay, alright. Alright.
- I appreciate it, you know.

19:39.714 --> 19:40.915
If you could just...

19:45.252 --> 19:47.622
One dark and stormy night,

19:48.288 --> 19:51.425
four orphaned children
were traveling south

19:51.458 --> 19:56.229
to their nearest living relative
when they got lost.

19:56.263 --> 19:59.399
As orphan children usually do, you
know, they're always getting lost,

19:59.433 --> 20:02.402
you just really have to... to watch
out for that with orphan children.

20:02.436 --> 20:06.373
And they stomped across
Black Ridge Rock.

20:06.941 --> 20:09.476
Just 10 minutes away from here.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.478
That's where that waterfall is
that I was telling you about.

20:11.512 --> 20:13.581
You climb up a rope and then
you can jump off into the water.

20:13.614 --> 20:16.617
Maybe if we just save the anecdotes
till the end, that would be great.

20:20.722 --> 20:24.324
They were starved,
out of rations.

20:24.759 --> 20:31.532
When they suddenly came across some berries
on the side of the road red as blood,

20:32.734 --> 20:35.770
in their desperation and
against their better judgment,

20:35.803 --> 20:40.742
they gorge themselves until
they could not eat any more.

20:40.775 --> 20:42.375
Sounds like a bad call.

20:42.409 --> 20:49.316
A very bad call...
for the berries were poisonous

20:49.851 --> 20:55.523
and slowly started to drive
the children mad.

20:56.691 --> 20:58.526
Indeed.

21:00.528 --> 21:06.000
The next morning, a weary traveler
approached their campsite.

21:06.701 --> 21:11.639
All he wanted was some company,
maybe a little bit of water.

21:13.107 --> 21:18.746
But what he saw was worse
than his worst nightmare.

21:19.881 --> 21:24.351
What he saw chilled him to the
bone and made his hair turn white.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.755
What he saw made him do
a little shiver like...

21:28.589 --> 21:30.390
- What he saw...
- They ate each other.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.592
- The children ate each other.
- Francis.

21:31.626 --> 21:34.461
He found four piles of bloody
skin and bones in a circle

21:34.494 --> 21:36.831
- because the children ate each other.
- But that's not all.

21:36.864 --> 21:39.667
The bushes with the red berries
started growing out of the carcasses

21:39.700 --> 21:42.103
and from then on, any travelers
who pass are slowly driven mad.

21:42.136 --> 21:44.906
- You are the worst person I know.
- Damn, Francis.

21:44.939 --> 21:47.440
Okay, it's just a dumb story.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.578
- Says the girl who'd be wailing every night after she heard it.
- Okay, I wasn't wailing.

21:50.611 --> 21:53.714
- Uh, aahhh!
- Stop!

21:53.748 --> 21:55.516
Didn't sound anything like that.

21:55.550 --> 21:58.385
Well, I mean, there's some
plot holes in this story.

21:59.086 --> 22:01.622
- Oh, sorry, forgotten history.
- Thank you.

22:01.656 --> 22:05.358
I mean, how did they all eat each other
just enough to leave skin and bones.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.694
They had gone mad.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.461
And why are orphan children
traveling alone?

22:08.495 --> 22:10.531
- I mean, where are Social Services?
- Oh.

22:10.565 --> 22:12.733
I thought you were
into this kind of stuff.

22:12.767 --> 22:15.102
Uh, I'm into the occult.
This is kids' stuff.

22:15.136 --> 22:17.004
Uh-oh. Kids' stuff.

22:17.038 --> 22:18.973
Be careful, you don't want
to offend the <i>Lost Children</i>.

22:19.006 --> 22:23.476
Mm, I think we'll be okay as long as
we've got Little Babs to keep us safe.

22:26.681 --> 22:29.116
<i>Lost Children</i>!

22:29.150 --> 22:33.386
No, Lauren, Lauren, calm down, it's just
a clap light. It's a little finicky.

22:34.655 --> 22:36.991
Oh.

22:37.024 --> 22:38.826
You got me.

22:38.860 --> 22:41.562
Oh, damn, broke Little Babs.

22:41.596 --> 22:42.597
Oh, sorry.

22:44.799 --> 22:45.833
Who the hell is that?

22:46.433 --> 22:47.802
I'll get it. No, I got it.

22:47.835 --> 22:48.769
Okay, you'll get it.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.911
Uh, hi.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.580
Hi.

23:04.085 --> 23:05.485
Can I help you?

23:06.921 --> 23:08.089
I'm James.

23:08.122 --> 23:09.690
I just live right over there.

23:09.724 --> 23:11.192
Oh, you're the new neighbor?

23:11.225 --> 23:13.961
- Yeah.
- Okay. Hi, I'm Francis.

23:13.995 --> 23:15.730
Francis. Right.

23:16.898 --> 23:17.965
Hello.

23:20.167 --> 23:22.603
Looks like you're having
a nice party.

23:22.637 --> 23:24.906
Oh, um, we're just here
for the weekend.

23:24.939 --> 23:26.874
Well, I just...

23:28.009 --> 23:32.013
I just wanted to stop by and
let you know that I'm over there

23:32.046 --> 23:36.584
and if you need anything,
just let me know.

23:37.184 --> 23:40.121
- Cool. Okay, thank you. Bye.
- Okay.

23:42.723 --> 23:44.792
- What was that all about?
- That guy was the creepiest.

23:44.825 --> 23:46.761
I don't know, I think
he was trying to be nice.

23:47.828 --> 23:51.132
Some old dude in a cabin in the
middle of the woods trying to be nice.

23:51.165 --> 23:52.900
Come on,
he sounds like a psycho to me.

23:52.934 --> 23:55.136
Are you calling nana a psycho?

23:55.169 --> 23:56.938
I'm not gonna say
nana was normal.

23:58.005 --> 23:59.240
Okay, okay.

23:59.273 --> 24:02.810
So, to make up for our Little
Babs, I made us all some drinks.

24:02.843 --> 24:04.545
Wooo, what have we here?

24:04.578 --> 24:06.847
It's a Lauren originale.

24:06.881 --> 24:09.150
It's equal parts vodka, rum,
Red Bull

24:09.183 --> 24:10.952
and a little secret
something-something that I put inside.

24:10.985 --> 24:13.587
Okay, so you mean, the maple syrup
that's over there on the counter

24:13.621 --> 24:15.089
next to all those things
you just mixed it?

24:16.223 --> 24:17.158
You suck.

24:17.191 --> 24:19.492
So, wait, maple syrup?
That sounds gnarly.

24:19.527 --> 24:21.162
It's so good. Francis, tell him.

24:21.996 --> 24:23.531
Um, yeah,
it's definitely something.

24:23.564 --> 24:25.099
Okay, if you say so.

24:25.132 --> 24:27.134
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, I want to make a toast.

24:31.238 --> 24:32.974
- Barb.
- Hmm?

24:33.708 --> 24:34.775
Sorry.

24:35.242 --> 24:37.078
I'm sorry. Sorry. Okay.

24:38.646 --> 24:43.985
Okay, so we're all moving on to the
real world, a little too real for real.

24:44.952 --> 24:45.953
Uh-huh.

24:45.987 --> 24:47.388
Sorry. That was me.

24:47.421 --> 24:50.558
- Looks good to me.
- Okay, you know what, I've an idea.

24:51.726 --> 24:52.660
Phones in the bag.

24:53.127 --> 24:54.862
- What?
- Wait.

24:54.895 --> 24:56.831
Oh, come on, we can go a weekend
being unplugged.

24:56.864 --> 24:58.132
Hal, can't go a weekend
without Pornhub.

24:58.165 --> 25:01.302
Okay, no, but seriously,
what if I get an important email?

25:01.335 --> 25:03.237
It can wait till Monday, right?

25:03.838 --> 25:05.573
Come on, pass it around.

25:05.606 --> 25:07.641
You know what, I'm in.

25:07.675 --> 25:09.010
- Yes.
- Fine.

25:09.877 --> 25:11.645
Okay, me, too.

25:14.982 --> 25:16.584
- Uh-huh.
- Barb.

25:16.617 --> 25:18.319
- Come on.
- You ain't that special.

25:18.352 --> 25:21.689
- Phone in the bag. Now.
- There.

25:21.722 --> 25:23.657
- Good job, Barbara Ann.
- Shut up Beach Boys.

25:23.691 --> 25:24.558
Alright.

25:26.093 --> 25:27.261
Okay, no, whose was that?

25:27.294 --> 25:30.564
- I guess we'll just wait and see.
- No. Come on.

25:31.732 --> 25:33.801
Seriously, come on.

25:35.836 --> 25:38.906
Okay, no. If I can't read it,
you can't either.

25:38.939 --> 25:40.908
- Alright, alright.
- Okay, here, here.

25:40.941 --> 25:42.143
Alright.

25:43.277 --> 25:46.714
Okay, I'm gonna put these
someplace safe.

25:52.053 --> 25:53.854
There, no more distractions.

25:53.888 --> 25:55.423
Alright.

25:55.456 --> 26:00.828
Alright. As I was saying, we're all
moving on and up in the world, right.

26:00.861 --> 26:02.596
Some of us moving cross-country.

26:03.864 --> 26:05.299
Some of us even further
than that.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.669
And some of us
are going to kick ass

26:08.702 --> 26:10.971
at whatever publication
is lucky enough to hire her.

26:11.005 --> 26:12.206
Thanks.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.874
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.
- But for right now...

26:13.908 --> 26:15.209
Okay, not you.

26:16.511 --> 26:18.913
But for right now,
we're all just here having a good time.

26:18.946 --> 26:20.047
So, let's do this.

26:21.382 --> 26:23.651
Get me a white girl wasted.

26:26.053 --> 26:28.989
- Oh, my God.
- It tastes like waffles.

26:31.826 --> 26:33.127
Oh, my God.

26:46.941 --> 26:48.175
Knock it down.

28:40.555 --> 28:43.390
Yo, I'm gonna go smoke a cig.

28:45.893 --> 28:48.028
Oh, shit.

28:51.165 --> 28:52.032
Okay.

29:19.026 --> 29:20.227
Oh.

29:22.329 --> 29:24.331
Woo-hoo!

29:24.365 --> 29:25.499
Oh.

29:26.066 --> 29:27.434
I didn't know you smoked.

29:29.069 --> 29:31.005
- I don't.
- Huh.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.941
Crazy night, huh?

29:34.842 --> 29:36.076
Yeah.

29:37.878 --> 29:39.079
What's everyone else up to?

29:40.414 --> 29:42.550
- Fran's asleep.
- Lauren still puking?

29:42.584 --> 29:44.151
Mm-hmm.

29:44.184 --> 29:45.319
But Hal's with her.

29:48.922 --> 29:50.090
Ah...

29:54.495 --> 29:56.864
- So, we're being back...
- I think I'm gonna go to bed.

29:56.897 --> 29:57.831
What?

29:58.767 --> 30:00.467
I... I said
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

30:01.536 --> 30:02.870
Ah.

30:07.875 --> 30:08.909
Goodnight, Terry.

30:15.182 --> 30:17.985
<i>Ocupado</i>.

30:18.018 --> 30:21.322
Ocu-potito.

30:21.355 --> 30:23.957
So, I'm just bringing you
some water.

30:24.491 --> 30:26.193
Oh, thank you.

30:32.933 --> 30:34.602
How you doing?

30:35.402 --> 30:38.305
I think I'm almost done
but just to be safe,

30:38.339 --> 30:40.307
you should probably stay back
because I don't want to puke on you.

30:41.942 --> 30:44.044
I've had worse.

30:44.646 --> 30:47.981
What, did someone like,
shit on you or something?

30:48.015 --> 30:49.383
Oh, God, that was so gross.

30:49.416 --> 30:50.951
Oh, well, now I'm turned on.

30:53.688 --> 30:54.922
Mm.

30:55.389 --> 30:56.890
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

30:56.924 --> 30:58.959
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

30:58.992 --> 31:00.227
- Okay.
- Just give it a minute.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.868
Really glad you
and Terry are here.

31:08.369 --> 31:10.070
Yeah. I am, too.

31:10.672 --> 31:12.406
It's cool that you guys
are so close.

31:13.073 --> 31:15.008
I... I never had that.

31:15.042 --> 31:16.276
What do you mean?

31:16.310 --> 31:20.080
Well, my dad was in the military
and we just moved around a lot.

31:20.481 --> 31:23.618
I tried to stay close with people but
like, after a year or so, we just...

31:25.018 --> 31:25.886
I don't know.

31:27.187 --> 31:28.455
How do you guys do it?

31:30.057 --> 31:31.626
We grew up together.

31:31.659 --> 31:35.563
Yeah, but like what do you talk about
after all those years of just not talking?

31:35.597 --> 31:40.968
I don't know,
stupid shit, memes.

31:43.470 --> 31:45.573
And now, you're going to Austin.

31:45.607 --> 31:46.541
It's awesome.

31:47.509 --> 31:48.375
Yeah.

31:50.110 --> 31:50.978
What?

31:53.180 --> 31:54.448
No, it... I'm...

31:55.282 --> 31:56.684
It will be awesome.

31:57.251 --> 32:03.457
It's just that, Terry's vision
of Austin is us moving there

32:03.490 --> 32:07.060
and kind of dicking around
until we figure our lives out.

32:07.662 --> 32:12.634
Sounds like fun
but, um, I don't know, I've...

32:12.667 --> 32:14.001
I've lived at home
for three years.

32:15.068 --> 32:19.607
I've sort of reached my limit
of dicking around.

32:20.274 --> 32:22.677
Hmm. And have you figured
out your life yet?

32:22.710 --> 32:24.746
Nope.

32:27.314 --> 32:28.482
Oh...

33:35.750 --> 33:38.786
Good morning.

33:40.655 --> 33:42.289
There's a water bottle
in my bag.

33:42.757 --> 33:44.559
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

33:56.604 --> 33:57.572
What are these?

33:58.540 --> 33:59.406
Hmm?

34:11.451 --> 34:12.754
Hal.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.134
Oh, I don't want to hear it.

34:27.167 --> 34:29.403
Fair.

34:30.772 --> 34:33.240
Maybe we should get up.

34:33.608 --> 34:34.474
Yeah.

34:38.546 --> 34:40.548
Oh, Francis will kill me.

34:41.649 --> 34:42.517
What?

34:54.596 --> 34:55.830
We have to do this right now?

34:57.297 --> 34:58.733
Could you please get up
and help us?

34:58.766 --> 35:01.569
- Very funny, Francis.
- What?

35:01.603 --> 35:04.872
No, no, no, no. We get it.
You can do pranks, too.

35:04.906 --> 35:07.842
Just kind of weird that you come
into my room and put this in there.

35:08.576 --> 35:10.344
I didn't make those. You did.

35:10.377 --> 35:11.613
Uh, no.

35:13.380 --> 35:15.516
- Okay, well someone did.
- Mm-hmm.

35:15.550 --> 35:16.751
What the hell is this?

35:18.753 --> 35:20.454
Guys, come...

35:20.487 --> 35:22.757
Is that supposed to scare us?
I mean, it's not funny.

35:22.790 --> 35:24.759
Come on, Francis,
I'm not that obvious.

35:24.792 --> 35:29.262
Alright, well, whoever's responsible,
haha, very funny, you failed.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.767
Hi. Nobody camping?

35:32.800 --> 35:34.836
I don't see why not, right?

35:34.869 --> 35:37.739
Well, if we do, y'all gonna have
to give me a minute.

35:37.772 --> 35:40.240
- Can you put some pants on?
- Uh-uh.

35:46.714 --> 35:48.916
That was a pretty good idea
with those dolls.

35:48.950 --> 35:51.151
How did you even make them?

35:51.586 --> 35:52.687
Told you I didn't.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.188
Yeah,
but that was in front of them.

35:57.391 --> 35:59.226
What? What's wrong?

36:01.062 --> 36:04.599
You, uh, told the movie theater
that you quitting yet?

36:04.966 --> 36:06.634
No, they only need two weeks.

36:07.467 --> 36:09.704
I mean, it's pretty soon.

36:10.772 --> 36:12.305
When you're gonna tell it.

36:12.339 --> 36:13.708
I haven't really thought
about it.

36:15.810 --> 36:18.579
- Can we not do this right now?
- I mean, whatever.

36:20.515 --> 36:22.884
So, if you get stung by it
all you have to do is take...

36:22.917 --> 36:24.719
Yo, how is it going back there?

36:28.455 --> 36:29.657
Come on, admit it.

36:29.691 --> 36:31.258
You had fun last night.

36:32.359 --> 36:34.428
Yeah, but I'm still suffering
the consequences.

37:16.604 --> 37:18.706
<i>And damn, baby come back to me</i>

37:26.413 --> 37:28.983
How do you know
Bigfoot is not.

37:31.018 --> 37:34.589
Oh, my God, this place is good.

37:34.622 --> 37:37.257
Yeah, there's a waterfall,
you can jump off of over there.

37:37.725 --> 37:38.693
Cool.

37:38.726 --> 37:40.895
So, is this where
that scary story happened?

37:40.928 --> 37:41.796
Yeah.

37:42.663 --> 37:45.298
Weird.
I don't see any haunted berries.

37:45.332 --> 37:47.835
Well, you wouldn't be able to
tell if they were haunted, so.

37:47.869 --> 37:49.871
Whoo!

37:57.645 --> 37:58.980
- Stupid.
- He's alive!

37:59.013 --> 38:00.047
Leave him alone.

38:00.848 --> 38:01.783
And who's next?

38:12.593 --> 38:13.694
Who-hoo.

38:13.728 --> 38:14.829
Yeah!

38:14.862 --> 38:17.999
I literally cannot believe
you guys are drinking again.

38:18.032 --> 38:21.434
Yeah, just the thought
of alcohol makes me feel sick.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.371
You guys are weak.

38:24.404 --> 38:26.674
You guys are alcoholics.

38:28.341 --> 38:32.079
I gotta say, Fran man, I see you go that
hard since Bradley's graduation party.

38:33.080 --> 38:34.615
It brings tears to my eyes, man.

38:34.649 --> 38:38.686
Yeah, I can't say I look back on that
night with as much fondness as you do.

38:40.487 --> 38:41.923
So much for 20 percent.

38:42.957 --> 38:44.025
It still might not rain.

38:49.764 --> 38:51.899
- Terry, get your feet.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

38:51.933 --> 38:54.936
- Stop putting like all of your leg on my leg.
- I am sorry.

38:54.969 --> 38:56.504
I got it.
God, you're so damn picky.

38:59.907 --> 39:01.909
The tent is just
a little bit small.

39:02.677 --> 39:04.078
So now what?

39:04.812 --> 39:06.514
As long as we're drinking,
let's play a game.

39:06.547 --> 39:07.715
Wait,
are we drinking now?

39:07.748 --> 39:09.449
- No, I'm game.
- Yes. Come on, Barb.

39:10.585 --> 39:11.819
What are we gonna play?

39:11.853 --> 39:13.486
Um, never have I ever.

39:13.521 --> 39:15.990
Oh, let's do it.
Everybody get a drink.

39:16.023 --> 39:17.925
No, no, thank you.

39:17.959 --> 39:18.826
Come on, come on.

39:18.860 --> 39:20.695
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- Come on, Barb.

39:20.728 --> 39:24.131
Barb, you were the
rallying queen in high school.

39:24.699 --> 39:26.433
Fine.

39:26.466 --> 39:27.935
Alright, Francis.

39:29.770 --> 39:31.471
- Uh...
- Don't be such a Francis...

39:31.505 --> 39:32.506
Come on, Francis.

39:32.540 --> 39:34.008
I'll make it weak.
I'll make it weak.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.142
Okay, fine.

39:39.814 --> 39:42.415
Alright. T-Dog, start us off.

39:42.449 --> 39:44.552
Uh, excuse me,
that's T-unit to you.

39:44.585 --> 39:46.187
Oh, my sincerest apologies.

39:46.220 --> 39:49.056
Go ahead.

39:50.091 --> 39:56.530
Never have I been to Mexico?

40:01.168 --> 40:02.904
You have to drink.

40:03.604 --> 40:05.773
Wow. Such uncultured slime.

40:05.806 --> 40:07.909
Drink up, buddy.

40:07.942 --> 40:13.748
Um, okay,
never have I ever been in love?

40:15.683 --> 40:16.617
Mm-mm.

40:21.622 --> 40:25.026
Never have I ever seen
<i>Star Wars</i>.

40:25.059 --> 40:26.493
- What?
- What?

40:26.928 --> 40:28.663
Oh, God, I thought I liked you.

40:28.696 --> 40:29.897
Alright, well,
I haven't either, so.

40:29.931 --> 40:32.233
What?

40:32.266 --> 40:34.101
Alright, alright.

40:34.135 --> 40:40.708
Um, never have I ever liked
Jeremy Jacobs?

40:40.741 --> 40:44.011
Oh, my God.

40:44.045 --> 40:45.513
Who's Jeremy Jacobs?

40:45.546 --> 40:47.148
He was this kid
in our high school.

40:47.181 --> 40:49.684
The weirdest kid
in our high school.

40:49.717 --> 40:55.089
No, he was not that weird. He just...
Well, okay, he was into insects.

40:55.122 --> 40:57.725
- Really into insects.
- No.

40:58.859 --> 41:02.697
Not exact, no, no. He...
I didn't mean it like that.

41:02.730 --> 41:05.599
- It's he just liked them, okay. But he was really cute.
- Alright, alright.

41:05.633 --> 41:07.201
- Drink, drink.
- He was cute.

41:09.270 --> 41:10.137
So cute.

41:10.938 --> 41:12.039
Alright, it's your turn,
Frannie.

41:13.741 --> 41:16.610
Okay. Um, never have I ever...

41:17.278 --> 41:19.814
- God, I suck at this game...
- Oh.

41:21.248 --> 41:25.853
Never have I ever
failed a class?

41:25.886 --> 41:26.821
Failed.

41:29.790 --> 41:32.626
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

41:32.660 --> 41:33.995
Chill, chill,
that was freshman vile.

41:34.895 --> 41:38.265
Well, you know what, never have I
ever cared about failing a class.

41:38.299 --> 41:39.767
I'm proud of that.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.035
Whatever.

41:45.773 --> 41:50.277
Okay. Um, never have I ever
graduated college?

41:50.311 --> 41:52.847
Oh, nice. Okay.

41:58.919 --> 42:03.758
Okay. Never have I ever
had a one-night stand.

42:07.962 --> 42:10.097
Excuse me, Sir, what about Elsa?

42:10.131 --> 42:12.033
Uh, that was two nights.

42:15.102 --> 42:21.308
Oh. Um, never have I ever
puked from drinking.

42:21.342 --> 42:22.910
Damn.

42:22.943 --> 42:25.546
Okay, yeah, last night
was not my proudest moment.

42:26.180 --> 42:27.882
At least we had a good time
though, alright?

42:27.915 --> 42:29.750
No, we had a good time,
everybody.

42:32.720 --> 42:36.590
Never have I ever been caught masturbating
in the middle school locker room.

42:36.624 --> 42:37.825
Whoa.

42:37.858 --> 42:40.795
How are you gonna say that
in front of people?

42:40.828 --> 42:43.197
- Drink, Hal.
- I'm drinking, Francis.

42:43.230 --> 42:44.198
Oh, come on, guys.

42:44.231 --> 42:46.634
Alright, come on now.
Never have...

42:46.667 --> 42:49.036
Alright, never have I ever
been arrested?

42:49.070 --> 42:51.005
- Hal.
- Hey, you skipped me, man.

42:51.038 --> 42:52.773
Shut up, okay?

42:52.807 --> 42:53.707
You're a jerk.

42:53.741 --> 42:55.176
Okay, hey, alright,
alright, alright...

42:55.209 --> 42:56.343
- I'm so sorry, did I hurt your feelings?
- Look, never have I ever...

42:56.377 --> 42:59.346
- Stop. Stop.
- No, you know what, I think I'm done.

42:59.380 --> 43:00.748
- Hey, Francis, come on.
- Are you kidding me?

43:00.781 --> 43:03.184
No, everyone, stop. Never have I
ever been to the Mojave Desert?

43:03.217 --> 43:05.119
- What?
- No one's been to the Mojave Desert, Terry.

43:05.152 --> 43:07.388
Okay, everyone can chill.
I'm just trying to drink, okay.

43:07.421 --> 43:09.957
Okay, wait, wait. Francis,
I have a good one. Just wait a second.

43:11.859 --> 43:15.930
Never have I ever had sex
with someone in this group?

43:19.033 --> 43:20.668
Obviously, we've never had s...

43:25.206 --> 43:28.642
- What the fuck?
- Wait, what? When did this happen?

43:28.676 --> 43:30.878
How could you not tell me this?

43:30.911 --> 43:32.613
Barb, how could you not tell me
about this?

43:33.981 --> 43:37.184
It was a complicated situation.

43:37.218 --> 43:39.353
It happened
after Bradley's party.

43:40.121 --> 43:41.590
Wait, what?

43:41.622 --> 43:44.658
We bolted together after the cops
showed up. One thing led to another.

43:44.692 --> 43:45.893
Look, it was a one-time thing,
okay.

43:45.926 --> 43:48.262
- It's not that big of a deal, alright?
- Busted.

43:49.330 --> 43:51.899
Wait, you bolted
after the cops came?

43:51.932 --> 43:55.136
Barb, you told me that you got sick and
that's why you had to go home early.

43:55.836 --> 43:58.038
Are you serious that's...
that's what happened,

43:58.072 --> 44:00.341
you ran when the cops came
and left me there alone?

44:00.374 --> 44:02.209
Yo, everybody ran when the cops
showed up, Francis.

44:02.243 --> 44:05.412
Yeah, but not everybody promised
they would take care of me

44:05.446 --> 44:07.882
on the first night that I was drinking
in high school. I was really scared.

44:09.116 --> 44:11.285
I literally don't know
what to say right now.

44:13.921 --> 44:15.356
It was a long time ago.

44:16.924 --> 44:19.160
Okay, look, let's just play something
else, alright? I brought beans, okay.

44:19.193 --> 44:21.328
- No one wants to play beans.
- Yo, Francis, come on. - No, I don't...

44:21.362 --> 44:22.263
I don't wanna do that.

44:24.031 --> 44:25.166
Francis.

44:25.199 --> 44:27.701
No, I got it. I got it.

44:37.111 --> 44:39.947
- Francis. Francis.
- What?

44:39.980 --> 44:42.316
- Where are you going?
- Back to the cabin.

44:42.349 --> 44:43.417
Okay, wait.

44:44.084 --> 44:45.319
Okay, I know she lied to you

44:45.352 --> 44:48.789
but that was like four years ago
and it didn't ruin your life.

44:48.822 --> 44:51.358
When Brown found out,
they revoked my acceptance.

44:52.426 --> 44:54.461
Yeah,
but things are now alright.

44:54.495 --> 44:57.798
And if you hadn't gone to State,
you never would have met little me.

44:58.265 --> 45:00.968
No, I know.
I'm sorry, I don't...

45:04.772 --> 45:07.875
It's just I thought when I brought
Barb here, I don't know, I don't...

45:07.908 --> 45:08.909
I don't know what I thought.

45:10.311 --> 45:13.080
Okay, let's just go back to the
campsite, we'll talk to everyone.

45:13.113 --> 45:14.782
It's really not a big deal.

45:14.815 --> 45:16.016
No, it is a big deal.

45:16.050 --> 45:17.985
Here you're not even listening
to me.

45:18.018 --> 45:20.522
You know, it feels like lately,
you're not even on my side.

45:20.555 --> 45:22.156
Okay,
now, you're just being dramatic.

45:22.189 --> 45:23.257
No, I'm not.

45:24.291 --> 45:26.293
This weekend was supposed
to be about friends,

45:26.327 --> 45:28.128
you and me,
not you and my brother.

45:29.930 --> 45:30.898
Okay, that's...

45:32.433 --> 45:34.235
Okay, I might have gotten
a little out of it.

45:34.268 --> 45:36.203
Okay,
we didn't even do anything.

45:36.237 --> 45:38.172
Alright, you're right.
I'm sorry.

45:38.205 --> 45:41.475
We can still make this about us
having fun.

45:42.042 --> 45:43.077
Just the two of us.

45:43.578 --> 45:45.813
Really? How?

45:45.846 --> 45:51.385
I... I don't know, but I know
that it's cold and wet and rainy,

45:51.418 --> 45:53.354
so let's just go back
to the campsite

45:53.387 --> 45:56.290
and we can grab the hammocks and
sleep far away from the group.

45:56.323 --> 45:58.492
And then tomorrow,
if you still want to leave,

45:58.526 --> 46:02.096
we can go back to town and go
to that really cool karaoke bar.

46:09.270 --> 46:10.137
Fine.

46:13.340 --> 46:15.309
I don't know if we should go
to.

46:16.143 --> 46:17.311
It's kind of lame.

46:17.344 --> 46:21.015
It's perfect because then,
we'll be the coolest ones there.

46:40.367 --> 46:43.871
So, uh, Bradley's.

46:50.444 --> 46:52.547
So, do you think
they just left or...

46:57.985 --> 46:59.320
Hey, can I have the hammocks?

47:00.054 --> 47:01.221
Won't you guys get wet?

47:01.255 --> 47:03.057
No, it's not really raining
anymore.

47:18.372 --> 47:19.541
Okay, goodnight.

48:41.221 --> 48:42.089
Hey.

48:51.999 --> 48:52.933
How'd you sleep?

49:05.012 --> 49:08.683
So, pretty crazy night
last night, wasn't it?

49:14.455 --> 49:18.526
You know, I didn't know
about Terry and Barb.

49:19.092 --> 49:20.127
You know that, right?

49:22.229 --> 49:23.096
Good morning.

49:32.339 --> 49:33.407
Where's Lauren?

49:34.074 --> 49:35.476
I don't know,
maybe she went to pee.

49:55.062 --> 49:57.732
I checked where she said she found a good
pee spot and she wasn't there either.

49:57.765 --> 49:59.266
She wasn't at the waterfall
either.

50:00.768 --> 50:02.604
- Lauren.
- Okay, we tried that already.

50:02.637 --> 50:04.606
Well, do you have
any better ideas?

50:04.639 --> 50:05.773
What if she got hurt
or something?

50:05.807 --> 50:08.041
Okay, okay,
let's not freak out here.

50:08.075 --> 50:10.277
She said she wanted to go to the
big waterfall. Maybe she went there?

50:10.310 --> 50:11.646
Yeah,
but why would she go alone?

50:11.679 --> 50:13.413
I don't know, she likes nature?

50:13.447 --> 50:15.148
Maybe she just wanted to be
by herself for a minute.

50:15.182 --> 50:16.751
What?

50:16.784 --> 50:19.521
You think Miss Nature decided to go to
a waterfall and not tell anyone of us?

50:19.554 --> 50:23.423
I don't know. Maybe it was dark and she
didn't want to wake anybody up and got...

50:23.457 --> 50:24.692
turned... I don't know.

50:24.726 --> 50:25.593
What do you mean she's been
wandering around all night alone?

50:25.627 --> 50:27.595
Yeah, dude,
that's a serious stretch.

50:27.629 --> 50:29.129
Okay.
It's just a suggestion, okay?

50:29.162 --> 50:30.397
Do you have anything helpful
to add?

50:30.430 --> 50:32.332
Uh, as a matter of fact, I do.

50:32.366 --> 50:35.435
Look, there's only one possible
explanation for all of this, okay.

50:35.469 --> 50:39.507
The weird berries, uh, the four
twig dolls back at the cabin.

50:39.541 --> 50:41.241
- Terry.
- Nah, uh,

50:41.275 --> 50:44.378
- it is the one and the only, <i>Lost Children</i> come to haunt us.
- Stop. Stop.

50:44.411 --> 50:48.148
- Can you be serious for once?
- Come on, she'll turn up.

50:48.181 --> 50:50.083
- She'll turn up?
- Yes.

50:50.117 --> 50:52.119
So, what you're saying is
we should sit around on our asses

50:52.152 --> 50:53.387
and wait for her to appear?

50:53.420 --> 50:55.489
Yes, sitting around your ass is
something you're really good at.

50:55.523 --> 50:57.457
Okay, you know what,
I'm not the only one thinking this, right?

50:57.491 --> 50:59.727
She, obviously, was fed up
with last night's bullshit

50:59.761 --> 51:01.361
and decided to just go back
to the cabin.

51:01.395 --> 51:04.799
Bullshit? You mean like finding out that
you and Barb basically got me arrested?

51:04.832 --> 51:07.301
- Oh, my God, Francis.
- No, we did not get you arrested, Francis.

51:07.334 --> 51:08.836
Can we please not do this
right now?

51:08.870 --> 51:10.838
Can we just focus
on finding our missing friend?

51:10.872 --> 51:12.406
What do you think
I have been doing?

51:12.439 --> 51:14.842
Okay, Terry might have a point.

51:14.876 --> 51:17.110
She might have gone back
to the cabin.

51:17.144 --> 51:18.846
Maybe we should just go check
the cabin.

51:18.880 --> 51:22.316
- Whoa, people are finally listening to me.
- Shut up.

51:25.218 --> 51:28.690
- Francis.
- I don't know.

51:29.757 --> 51:31.726
I mean, what if she's hurt
somewhere alone?

51:32.326 --> 51:33.728
I don't want
to just give up on her.

51:33.761 --> 51:35.262
We're not giving up on her.

51:35.295 --> 51:38.566
Maybe the best thing to do is to go back
to the cabin and wait for her there.

51:39.232 --> 51:41.501
I don't know why you're acting
like this is such a bad idea.

51:41.536 --> 51:43.605
Because I don't leave
my friends behind, Barb.

51:46.306 --> 51:49.510
Nobody's leaving anybody behind,
okay?

51:49.544 --> 51:52.680
You know what it does us no good
to just wander around out here.

52:21.274 --> 52:22.510
Anyone home?

52:41.328 --> 52:42.396
Hey, Francis.

52:42.964 --> 52:44.231
What?

52:45.600 --> 52:48.368
I know we have a lot more important
things to worry about but I...

52:48.402 --> 52:51.939
I wanted to tell you
that I was sorry for everything.

52:54.374 --> 52:55.710
Come on, I mean,
it was three years ago

52:55.743 --> 52:58.613
and I didn't know the cops
were gonna find you.

52:58.646 --> 53:01.181
- Yeah, alright.
- Okay, no, no, no, no, I'm... I'm sorry. I...

53:01.716 --> 53:03.618
I messed up, I know, okay.

53:03.651 --> 53:06.353
And mainly
because I didn't tell you but...

53:07.487 --> 53:09.791
Francis, you have to know how
important your friendship is to me.

53:10.457 --> 53:12.927
I mean we haven't really talked
in four years, Barb.

53:14.461 --> 53:15.897
Well, that's not all my fault,
is it?

53:28.843 --> 53:30.210
Lauren.

53:30.645 --> 53:32.312
- Lauren.
- Lauren.

53:33.514 --> 53:34.381
Lauren.

53:34.916 --> 53:36.316
- Lauren.
- Yo, Lauren.

53:36.984 --> 53:39.386
- She's not here.
- Shit.

53:39.921 --> 53:42.790
Yeah, guys, she isn't up here either.
We need to call the police.

53:42.824 --> 53:44.826
Uh, and tell them what?
That the ghost took our friend?

53:44.859 --> 53:46.728
Okay, well,
she's actually missing, so.

53:46.761 --> 53:47.929
I'm just gonna get the phones.

53:47.962 --> 53:50.531
Wait, um, uh, the...
the, neighbor guy.

53:50.565 --> 53:52.232
- James?
- Yeah, what about him?

53:52.265 --> 53:55.335
Yeah. Uh, well, the other night when we were
drinking, I went out to have a cig and...

53:55.937 --> 53:59.372
well I remember him dragging
something out of his truck

53:59.406 --> 54:02.844
- that kind of looked like a, uh...
- What?

54:04.011 --> 54:05.378
It looked like a body.

54:05.947 --> 54:07.548
- Oh, my God.
- No, I'm serious.

54:07.582 --> 54:09.617
You seriously think he could do
something to hurt Lauren?

54:10.685 --> 54:12.352
Yeah, dude,
this is not <i>Scooby-Doo</i>.

54:12.385 --> 54:14.956
- It's not <i>Ghostbusters</i> either.
- That's ridiculous.

54:14.989 --> 54:16.891
Okay, you're right, it was
definitely the <i>Lost Children</i>.

54:16.924 --> 54:19.392
No, I'm just saying that we
shouldn't jump to conclusions

54:19.426 --> 54:21.796
just because you think you saw
something when you were drunk.

54:21.829 --> 54:24.464
Okay, no, but when he came over that
day, he was seriously creepy.

54:24.498 --> 54:25.298
Thank you.

54:25.332 --> 54:27.334
Guys,
he's just a lonely old man.

54:27.367 --> 54:28.569
But you know what, whatever.
I'm calling the cops.

54:29.336 --> 54:30.638
Wait, wait.

54:32.439 --> 54:34.441
- The phones aren't here.
- What?

54:34.474 --> 54:36.443
- The phones aren't here.
- Guys.

54:36.476 --> 54:38.713
- Maybe you put them somewhere else?
- No, I saw...

54:38.746 --> 54:39.914
- Guys.
- What the fuck?

54:39.947 --> 54:41.516
Okay, guys, listen.

54:41.549 --> 54:42.550
Guys!

54:42.950 --> 54:43.985
Okay, so...

54:45.019 --> 54:46.386
You smell something burning?

54:54.796 --> 54:55.663
Shit.

55:12.914 --> 55:13.815
Jesus.

55:22.389 --> 55:25.358
- What are you doing?
- Research.

55:26.661 --> 55:29.897
"Since that day the <i>Lost Children</i> took
control of the Black Ridge mountains.

55:29.931 --> 55:32.767
Any traveler who disrespects or
travels on their land will..."

55:33.534 --> 55:34.401
Will what?

55:35.402 --> 55:36.938
- You're not buying into this, are you?
- No.

55:38.606 --> 55:39.472
Uh...

55:41.474 --> 55:44.111
I don't know, Terry, things have
just been getting pretty weird.

55:44.145 --> 55:46.147
I'm just saying
I'm not ruling anything out.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.983
Uh-uh, no, y'all have gone
completely off the rails.

55:49.016 --> 55:51.586
I can't believe I gotta say
this, but ghosts are not real.

55:54.055 --> 55:56.791
Okay, come on, no that...
that's... that's a loose nail.

55:56.824 --> 55:59.560
Okay, well then how do you
explain what's been going on?

55:59.594 --> 56:02.997
Lauren broke Little Babs, the <i>Lost
Children</i> took her. They took our phones.

56:03.030 --> 56:04.966
Oh, my God, ghosts didn't take
the phones, Barb, I did.

56:07.735 --> 56:10.638
Okay, I... I was drunk.

56:10.671 --> 56:13.841
I... I couldn't resist.
I didn't think it'd be that big of a deal.

56:13.875 --> 56:15.142
And you're just telling us now?

56:15.176 --> 56:16.844
Okay,
with all the shit happening,

56:16.878 --> 56:18.145
I didn't think that'd be
a good time to tell you,

56:18.179 --> 56:19.947
- "Hey, I took the phone."
- Where are they?

56:27.788 --> 56:29.790
You fucking idiot.

56:30.157 --> 56:32.026
You just left them outside?

56:32.059 --> 56:33.227
I'll buy everyone new phones.

56:33.261 --> 56:36.597
It's not the point, okay.
God, this is so fucking typical.

56:36.631 --> 56:39.166
Typical? I didn't know it was gonna
rain or that Lauren would get kidnapped

56:39.200 --> 56:42.003
- or any of that shit.
- Guys, stop, stop. Please, let's just get help.

56:42.036 --> 56:44.572
Yeah. Okay,
maybe that James guy has a phone.

56:44.605 --> 56:46.874
Or maybe he has Lauren and we're
playing right into his hands.

56:46.908 --> 56:48.643
Okay, then let's just go.

56:48.676 --> 56:50.811
- Really? Are you kidding me right now?
- We'll go to Marcos.

56:51.579 --> 56:54.982
Okay, I know how you feel about me suggesting this right now

56:55.016 --> 56:58.052
but we're not doing any good
just standing here.

56:58.085 --> 56:59.620
- Yeah.
- It's actually not a bad idea.

56:59.654 --> 57:01.856
Fine. You know what, you guys go
but I'm gonna stay here.

57:01.889 --> 57:03.090
- What?
- Francis.

57:03.124 --> 57:05.559
No, seriously. I need to be
here in case Lauren comes back.

57:05.593 --> 57:07.427
But go. Go.

57:08.963 --> 57:10.698
You can't stay here by yourself.

57:14.035 --> 57:15.102
I'll go.

57:15.903 --> 57:17.705
Uh, and I'll be back
as fast as I can.

57:21.575 --> 57:22.743
Please be careful.

57:43.030 --> 57:43.898
Now, what?

57:52.039 --> 57:54.141
You know, that James guy is
really raising some red flags.

57:54.175 --> 57:56.978
- I say we just grab some weapons and go over there.
- What?

57:57.011 --> 57:58.713
I'm just saying.
Just check it out.

57:58.746 --> 58:01.849
And if, you know, something looks out of the
ordinary, we'll just bust in guns blazing.

58:01.882 --> 58:03.884
- That's a terrible idea.
- Well, at least it's an idea.

58:03.918 --> 58:05.920
Yeah, well, it's a really
fucking stupid idea.

58:09.223 --> 58:11.058
- It won't start.
- What?

58:11.092 --> 58:12.660
The... the car, it's dead.

58:22.570 --> 58:24.572
Um, maybe we could jump it?

58:25.039 --> 58:26.874
Do you even know
what that means?

58:27.341 --> 58:29.610
It doesn't matter. Pop the hood.

58:30.211 --> 58:31.612
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

58:34.682 --> 58:36.550
Shit, the batteries.

58:36.584 --> 58:37.918
What do you mean the batteries?

58:39.253 --> 58:40.554
Someone took them.

58:41.822 --> 58:42.790
Oh, my God.

59:01.075 --> 59:02.511
Can we just talk about this
for a minute?

59:02.543 --> 59:05.579
- What's there to talk about?
- We have no proof that James did anything.

59:05.613 --> 59:07.081
Yeah, well, the batteries
didn't just disappear.

59:07.114 --> 59:09.016
Okay, well that's what we said
about the phones.

59:09.050 --> 59:11.852
Alright, look, I didn't touch
the batteries, alright. Did you?

59:11.886 --> 59:12.720
No, of course, not.

59:12.753 --> 59:14.622
Well, that doesn't mean
that James did.

59:14.655 --> 59:16.123
Even if it was him,
what are we gonna do?

59:16.157 --> 59:18.092
Go beat him up till he tells us
where Lauren is?

59:18.125 --> 59:19.860
There's four of us
and one of him.

59:19.894 --> 59:20.861
Let's just take him.

59:20.895 --> 59:24.131
Take him, God,
nobody's taking anybody, okay?

59:24.165 --> 59:26.867
Whatever is going on here,
the police need to be involved.

59:26.901 --> 59:28.269
Any excuse to get out
of a fight.

59:28.936 --> 59:30.671
God, am I not surprised.

59:30.704 --> 59:33.207
Dude,
what are you talking about?

59:33.240 --> 59:36.277
- You know what, forget it.
- No, if you have something to say, just say it.

59:37.111 --> 59:38.345
How long were you gonna wait
to tell me

59:38.379 --> 59:40.581
- that you're moving to Nashville with Brian?
- What...

59:44.718 --> 59:45.886
Did you read my text?

59:48.823 --> 59:50.224
No, is that why you had
our phones out there?

59:50.257 --> 59:51.959
Okay, you know what,
we shouldn't talk about this.

59:51.992 --> 59:54.628
No, no, no, no, you can't just bring something
up like that and expect me to drop it.

59:54.662 --> 59:56.997
Okay, guys, guys, I... I really
don't know what's happening right now

59:57.031 --> 59:58.632
but please, can we just focus?

59:59.967 --> 1:00:03.370
Yeah. You know what, let's, um, let's...
let's go to Marcos.

1:00:03.404 --> 1:00:04.805
- We can use their phone.
- That...

1:00:04.839 --> 1:00:07.374
It's an hour and a half to do
whatever he wants to do to your girl.

1:00:07.408 --> 1:00:08.642
You really want that?

1:00:09.043 --> 1:00:11.679
My girl?
She's not my girl, okay?

1:00:11.712 --> 1:00:13.948
And I'm not just gonna burst
into somebody's house

1:00:13.981 --> 1:00:16.117
because I have to prove
something to you.

1:00:16.150 --> 1:00:18.419
I'm not asking you
to prove anything to me, man.

1:00:18.452 --> 1:00:20.087
- Just stop being so scared.
- What the fuck is your deal?

1:00:20.121 --> 1:00:22.256
My deal is that you're about
to bail on me

1:00:22.289 --> 1:00:23.757
two months before we're supposed
to move in together, man.

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:26.760
I'm not bailing, okay?
I'm not bailing.

1:00:26.794 --> 1:00:30.064
Brian just texted me and asked me what my
plans were for the next couple of years

1:00:30.097 --> 1:00:31.832
and I told him I am not sure.

1:00:31.866 --> 1:00:33.267
How are you not sure?

1:00:33.300 --> 1:00:35.269
Because I am fucking not, okay?

1:00:35.302 --> 1:00:36.670
I'm not sure.

1:00:37.972 --> 1:00:40.875
Look, our plans sound fun but
I can't keep doing this, dude.

1:00:40.908 --> 1:00:43.711
I can't keep just putting off
my life.

1:00:46.147 --> 1:00:48.849
Then what the hell have you been
doing the past three years?

1:00:49.884 --> 1:00:52.353
Uh, you know what, I...
I am going to Marcos.

1:00:52.386 --> 1:00:54.421
You guys can do whatever
the fuck you want.

1:00:54.455 --> 1:00:55.823
- Now come on, Hal, hey come on.
- No please.

1:00:58.993 --> 1:01:01.328
God, what the hell is his problem?

1:01:01.362 --> 1:01:03.130
Terry, can you please calm down?

1:01:03.164 --> 1:01:04.365
Wait, where's Francis?

1:01:04.398 --> 1:01:06.800
- He does this every time, Jesus Christ...
- Hey, Francis.

1:01:07.768 --> 1:01:09.136
Wait, where is Francis?

1:01:13.407 --> 1:01:14.275
Oh, my...

1:01:31.125 --> 1:01:32.193
Hey.

1:01:32.226 --> 1:01:33.427
- Come on.
- Please don't make me.

1:01:33.460 --> 1:01:36.330
Just... If I'm doing
this, you are, too. Let's go.

1:01:45.239 --> 1:01:47.274
- Terry, why is it open?
- Shut up.

1:02:07.361 --> 1:02:08.762
- Come on.
- Terry.

1:02:33.087 --> 1:02:36.190
- Bah!
- Lauren.

1:02:36.223 --> 1:02:37.559
Jeez.

1:02:37.592 --> 1:02:38.959
How's it going in there?

1:02:38.993 --> 1:02:39.793
Is it working?

1:02:40.828 --> 1:02:43.197
Yes, it's working,
a little too well.

1:02:43.230 --> 1:02:44.198
They're really nervous.

1:02:44.231 --> 1:02:47.868
Well, then good,
they will love the grand finale.

1:02:49.003 --> 1:02:50.304
I don't know if we should do it.

1:02:51.372 --> 1:02:52.406
What?

1:03:09.189 --> 1:03:10.525
Terry,
we shouldn't be doing this.

1:03:10.558 --> 1:03:12.393
Yeah, well, our friends
could be in there right now.

1:03:12.426 --> 1:03:15.229
Okay, well, what if it isn't him?
What if you're wrong?

1:03:20.467 --> 1:03:23.304
Why would he just leave
in the middle of terrorizing us?

1:03:23.337 --> 1:03:24.938
Maybe he's going after Hal.

1:03:29.276 --> 1:03:30.210
Terry.

1:03:34.014 --> 1:03:36.150
Okay, this is open.
Are you coming or what?

1:03:37.585 --> 1:03:38.553
Okay.

1:03:42.389 --> 1:03:43.324
Okay.

1:03:53.668 --> 1:03:55.969
Creepy start.

1:03:56.538 --> 1:03:57.404
Come on.

1:04:03.377 --> 1:04:06.280
Francis, I have been in
the woods since like 5 o'clock.

1:04:08.082 --> 1:04:10.618
Things are really out of control.
They're fighting and I just...

1:04:10.652 --> 1:04:11.686
I feel bad now.

1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:13.887
Because we were literally up
all night planning.

1:04:13.921 --> 1:04:15.389
- No, I know but it's just...
- We can't just back out now.

1:04:15.422 --> 1:04:17.191
- it's so...
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1:04:17.659 --> 1:04:19.093
You guys.

1:04:21.995 --> 1:04:24.064
Hal, hey.

1:04:24.098 --> 1:04:26.467
You set Little Babs on fire.

1:04:27.669 --> 1:04:32.139
You took the time to make
little stick dolls.

1:04:43.450 --> 1:04:45.486
That is so fucking dumb.

1:04:46.253 --> 1:04:48.088
Okay, it was just a prank, Hal.

1:04:48.122 --> 1:04:49.557
You know,
I don't even care, alright.

1:04:49.591 --> 1:04:51.125
I just want to go home.

1:04:51.492 --> 1:04:53.227
Do you guys
have the car batteries?

1:04:53.260 --> 1:04:56.330
- Yeah. Hal, are you okay?
- Let's just go get the others.

1:04:56.363 --> 1:04:58.966
Okay, why are you acting
like this is such a big deal?

1:04:58.999 --> 1:05:00.602
You and Terry pull this stuff
all the time.

1:05:00.635 --> 1:05:02.202
Not like this, Francis.

1:05:02.236 --> 1:05:06.407
You know, for someone who gets off on
being more mature than everybody else,

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:07.609
this is really fucking childish.

1:05:07.642 --> 1:05:10.144
Okay, don't get off on...
You know what, you're just mad

1:05:10.177 --> 1:05:12.045
because you've never been on the
other side of a prank before.

1:05:12.079 --> 1:05:14.281
I don't think
you understand pranks.

1:05:25.426 --> 1:05:26.360
Francis.

1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:28.563
Lauren.

1:05:28.596 --> 1:05:30.063
Why are you whispering?

1:05:31.064 --> 1:05:32.065
Good point.

1:05:34.501 --> 1:05:35.502
Francis.

1:05:37.037 --> 1:05:38.005
Lauren.

1:05:39.541 --> 1:05:42.242
Okay, well, obviously,
they're not here. So, let's go.

1:05:42.710 --> 1:05:45.680
No, we just got here, Barb, God.

1:05:48.482 --> 1:05:49.617
Jesus Christ.

1:05:52.319 --> 1:05:54.254
Okay, well,
he's not a vegetarian.

1:05:54.288 --> 1:05:56.290
Oh, come on, Barb,
stop joking around.

1:05:56.323 --> 1:05:58.258
This guy is a creep
and you know it.

1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:02.396
Look, our friends are missing and this guy
clearly has something to do with it, okay?

1:06:02.429 --> 1:06:04.031
And stop looking at me
like that.

1:06:04.064 --> 1:06:05.265
You know I'm right.

1:06:05.633 --> 1:06:07.669
What, did college take away
your common sense?

1:06:08.536 --> 1:06:12.339
Okay, well, obviously, I had no common sense
in the first place if I slept with you.

1:06:14.074 --> 1:06:15.442
Damn, I didn't realize
it was such a mistake.

1:06:15.476 --> 1:06:18.513
Oh, my God, please don't act like it mattered to you.

1:06:29.423 --> 1:06:30.658
Okay, come on.

1:06:33.494 --> 1:06:37.397
- For the record, it did matter.
- Terry.

1:06:38.499 --> 1:06:40.400
Terry. Come on.

1:07:16.236 --> 1:07:19.373
Where are my friends?

1:07:22.142 --> 1:07:23.545
Why don't you just
put that down?

1:07:25.279 --> 1:07:26.280
And we'll figure this out.

1:07:26.313 --> 1:07:29.651
Where are my friends?

1:07:31.351 --> 1:07:34.756
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just calm down.

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:37.257
No, I don't think so.

1:07:38.793 --> 1:07:42.730
Hey, don't even think about it.

1:07:46.300 --> 1:07:48.670
I don't know
where your friends are.

1:07:49.403 --> 1:07:50.772
I'll help you find them.

1:07:50.805 --> 1:07:52.306
Hey.

1:08:01.348 --> 1:08:04.786
Okay, I know it got a little
out of hand but it...

1:08:04.819 --> 1:08:07.187
- it was kind of funny.
- It might have been funny.

1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:10.892
If you guys hadn't spent an entire day
of our time here tearing everybody apart

1:08:10.925 --> 1:08:13.327
because of some shit
Barb pulled four years ago.

1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:15.429
Okay, it wasn't just about Barb,
alright?

1:08:15.462 --> 1:08:16.864
If you and Terry
hadn't shown up here,

1:08:16.898 --> 1:08:17.832
then we probably would have
had a good weekend.

1:08:17.865 --> 1:08:19.132
Oh, so it was all our fault?
Yes, kind of.

1:08:19.166 --> 1:08:20.267
Yeah, just calm down.

1:08:21.736 --> 1:08:23.337
You know what,
it wasn't even a mistake

1:08:23.370 --> 1:08:24.872
that we all showed up
on the same weekend.

1:08:24.906 --> 1:08:26.641
Mom told me
you guys would be up here.

1:08:27.341 --> 1:08:28.876
What?

1:08:28.910 --> 1:08:33.581
I just thought maybe it would be nice
if we all came up here one last time,

1:08:33.615 --> 1:08:37.117
you know, go out with a bang
before we sold the cabin.

1:08:38.251 --> 1:08:42.790
It might have been nice, too, if you hadn't
fucked everything up with your little prank.

1:08:45.526 --> 1:08:47.227
Hal, I...

1:08:50.632 --> 1:08:52.199
No.

1:08:55.335 --> 1:08:56.571
Terry, stop.

1:09:01.241 --> 1:09:02.442
Oh, my God.

1:09:13.988 --> 1:09:15.690
I don't even think
there was a bruise.

1:09:16.256 --> 1:09:19.259
I'm so sorry, James.
We didn't mean to get you involved.

1:09:19.292 --> 1:09:21.696
Well, what's done is done.

1:09:21.729 --> 1:09:24.364
No, I know, but I can't believe
I let it go this far.

1:09:24.398 --> 1:09:25.800
Yeah, I can't either.

1:09:25.833 --> 1:09:29.369
We didn't think you'd attack anybody.
We just thought you'd be scared.

1:09:29.971 --> 1:09:32.439
Well, at least no one
got seriously hurt.

1:09:33.407 --> 1:09:38.178
I would just like to add that I was
always doubtful of you being a psycho.

1:09:38.713 --> 1:09:39.580
Thanks.

1:09:39.614 --> 1:09:42.617
Where did that idea come from?

1:09:44.619 --> 1:09:49.924
Okay, the other night, you were dragging
something out of your truck and it...

1:09:50.958 --> 1:09:54.494
I was drunk, so, of course,
everything that's happened, I believed it.

1:09:54.529 --> 1:09:56.229
Yeah, that explains it.

1:09:57.330 --> 1:09:59.399
I killed a boar, got back late

1:09:59.433 --> 1:10:03.538
and, uh, I wanted to treat
the meat before it spoiled.

1:10:05.372 --> 1:10:06.339
I make jerky.

1:10:08.009 --> 1:10:09.644
Well, that makes sense.

1:10:10.444 --> 1:10:14.448
Why don't I put on some tea and
we can keep talking this out?

1:10:15.683 --> 1:10:16.551
Thank you.

1:10:23.323 --> 1:10:25.193
Well, that could have gone
a lot worse.

1:10:28.062 --> 1:10:29.396
Barb, I am...

1:10:33.701 --> 1:10:35.603
Just give her a sec.
I'll talk to her.

1:10:36.871 --> 1:10:38.673
Peppermint okay with everyone?

1:10:38.706 --> 1:10:39.607
Yeah.

1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:41.241
That'd be great. Thank you.

1:11:01.562 --> 1:11:02.730
Careful, it's hot.

1:11:11.371 --> 1:11:12.740
Why did you invite me here?

1:11:14.341 --> 1:11:16.644
- I mean, seriously, if you hate me that much...
- I don't hate you.

1:11:16.677 --> 1:11:18.780
I just...
Was it all for some stupid joke?

1:11:18.813 --> 1:11:19.781
No.

1:11:20.681 --> 1:11:23.350
No, we weren't even trying
to scare you.

1:11:23.751 --> 1:11:25.485
At least not at first.

1:11:29.724 --> 1:11:32.994
The twig dolls happened
before we went camping.

1:11:33.694 --> 1:11:34.629
Yeah, that...

1:11:35.963 --> 1:11:38.032
We just thought it would be
funny if we freaked out the boys.

1:11:40.735 --> 1:11:43.370
Glad you two are having
so much fun.

1:11:48.609 --> 1:11:51.946
We were gonna tell you,
but then things changed.

1:11:55.016 --> 1:11:57.852
I just don't understand why
that was such a big deal to you.

1:11:58.653 --> 1:11:59.954
You're acting
like I ruined your life.

1:11:59.987 --> 1:12:03.958
And seems like everything turned
out pretty damn fine to me.

1:12:10.832 --> 1:12:12.332
I... I...

1:12:14.869 --> 1:12:16.637
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1:12:18.673 --> 1:12:22.109
I haven't gotten a single
job offer from anywhere.

1:12:23.544 --> 1:12:24.477
Not one.

1:12:26.413 --> 1:12:27.748
Even Terry has a job.

1:12:29.550 --> 1:12:34.822
And you're going to London, which is amazing
and it's such a fantastic opportunity for you.

1:12:34.856 --> 1:12:40.595
But I feel like everyone else
is moving on

1:12:40.628 --> 1:12:43.898
and I'm not.

1:12:43.931 --> 1:12:49.704
And it's scary
and I don't like it.

1:12:49.737 --> 1:12:52.807
And... and I hate...
I hate feeling like this.

1:12:55.042 --> 1:12:56.611
I don't know what to do.

1:13:05.019 --> 1:13:06.721
I'm sorry, Francis.

1:13:08.689 --> 1:13:10.457
But that is not my fault.

1:13:21.135 --> 1:13:25.539
You know, I actually like having
the company, now that the fighting's over.

1:13:30.645 --> 1:13:32.580
Just one thing
I do miss out here.

1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:36.117
It's easy to take your friends
for granted

1:13:36.817 --> 1:13:38.786
when they've been with you
a long time.

1:13:39.253 --> 1:13:41.188
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1:13:54.268 --> 1:13:56.704
You know, nobody knows
what they are doing, Francis.

1:13:57.672 --> 1:13:59.774
Just because I have a job
for the next year

1:13:59.807 --> 1:14:02.977
does not mean
I have everything figured out.

1:14:03.010 --> 1:14:07.048
And I know it sucks
for the first time in your life

1:14:07.081 --> 1:14:10.117
everything isn't going exactly
how you want it to.

1:14:10.151 --> 1:14:12.620
But that doesn't mean
you get to take it out on us.

1:14:13.287 --> 1:14:14.454
No, I know.

1:14:17.258 --> 1:14:18.491
I'm sorry.

1:14:20.661 --> 1:14:22.596
I'm so stupid. I...

1:14:23.931 --> 1:14:26.600
I don't know why I wanted to come
back here in the first place.

1:14:27.668 --> 1:14:30.905
I guess I felt like if the two of us
could be together again, it would...

1:14:31.739 --> 1:14:32.606
Barb?

1:14:33.808 --> 1:14:35.843
I feel weird.

1:14:36.677 --> 1:14:38.045
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Barb.

1:15:22.156 --> 1:15:25.126
Francis,
was that really necessary?

1:15:28.329 --> 1:15:30.197
Why won't you just relax?

1:15:31.766 --> 1:15:32.833
What do you want?

1:15:33.901 --> 1:15:35.603
I just want us to get along.

1:15:36.103 --> 1:15:37.938
No, no, don't come any closer.

1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:42.243
You don't understand.
It's so quiet out here.

1:15:55.823 --> 1:16:01.862
You see, Francis,
you can be here forever with your friends.

1:16:03.030 --> 1:16:04.198
But maybe...

1:16:05.166 --> 1:16:06.834
You can't keep us in here.

1:16:10.671 --> 1:16:14.308
What are you so intent
on going back to?

1:16:16.710 --> 1:16:18.279
I know you're tired, Francis.

1:16:18.979 --> 1:16:20.815
Just go to sleep.

1:16:22.183 --> 1:16:23.684
And then we can be friends.

1:16:29.757 --> 1:16:30.758
Barb.

1:16:31.358 --> 1:16:33.227
We... we gotta get out of here.

1:16:33.961 --> 1:16:35.129
Okay.

1:16:46.173 --> 1:16:48.075
Lauren. Lauren.

1:16:48.109 --> 1:16:50.177
- Lauren, where are the car batteries?
- Mmm.

1:16:50.211 --> 1:16:52.046
Lauren, the car batteries.
What? Lauren?

1:16:55.049 --> 1:16:56.250
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

1:16:56.283 --> 1:16:57.985
Yes. Let's go. Let's go.

1:16:58.752 --> 1:16:59.653
Come on.

1:17:04.692 --> 1:17:05.893
Where did she say it was?

1:17:05.926 --> 1:17:07.161
Um, I don't know.

1:17:07.194 --> 1:17:11.665
I don't know. I don't know
where she put it. Um, okay.

1:17:12.700 --> 1:17:15.069
- Francis, please.
- I'm sorry. Okay.

1:17:18.839 --> 1:17:20.141
Oh, Barb.
Barb, I found it.

1:17:20.174 --> 1:17:21.175
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1:17:21.942 --> 1:17:23.310
- Can you get it by yourself?
- Yes.

1:17:23.344 --> 1:17:24.912
Okay. Come on, please.

1:17:26.380 --> 1:17:27.681
Oh, God.

1:17:28.716 --> 1:17:30.184
- You okay?
- Sssh!

1:17:33.821 --> 1:17:34.755
Come on.

1:17:44.331 --> 1:17:45.666
Francis.

1:17:47.067 --> 1:17:48.235
Barbara.

1:17:48.269 --> 1:17:49.870
Francis, we have to make a move.

1:17:49.904 --> 1:17:51.238
How did he get out?

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.282
Francis, come on,
we can do this.

1:18:04.818 --> 1:18:06.020
Look at me.

1:18:09.423 --> 1:18:10.925
What am I thinking?

1:18:18.098 --> 1:18:19.233
I know you're scared.

1:18:20.067 --> 1:18:21.302
On three.

1:18:22.203 --> 1:18:23.370
One...

1:18:26.073 --> 1:18:27.741
But you don't have to be.

1:18:31.912 --> 1:18:35.449
Two...

1:18:40.988 --> 1:18:42.189
Now.

1:18:52.366 --> 1:18:53.867
Please!

1:18:55.002 --> 1:18:57.037
Barb, I thought we were making
a break for it.

1:18:57.071 --> 1:18:58.105
We were supposed to attack.

1:18:59.006 --> 1:19:00.140
Uh...

1:19:01.308 --> 1:19:03.043
This does not have
to be violent.

1:19:04.111 --> 1:19:05.012
Hey.

1:19:13.921 --> 1:19:16.156
Barbara, let's go. Go, go.

1:19:29.103 --> 1:19:30.204
Oh, my God.

1:19:30.237 --> 1:19:32.106
- Francis, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:19:32.139 --> 1:19:33.774
You two are just like
that other one.

1:19:34.475 --> 1:19:36.110
She never understood either.

1:19:36.143 --> 1:19:37.177
Why do you have to be so...

1:19:42.983 --> 1:19:45.286
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, okay...

1:19:45.319 --> 1:19:47.421
- Come on.
- Come on, we have to get out of here.

1:21:01.061 --> 1:21:02.262
He's doing well.

1:21:07.434 --> 1:21:10.037
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Have a good one.

1:21:13.641 --> 1:21:15.275
He is gonna be okay.

1:21:15.309 --> 1:21:17.878
That's good.

1:21:18.412 --> 1:21:21.281
So, he was just living
in our cabin for weeks?

1:21:22.149 --> 1:21:23.183
Apparently.

1:21:25.653 --> 1:21:28.255
I'm gonna go to the vending machine.
You guys want something?

1:21:28.288 --> 1:21:30.124
Uh, no, thank you, I'm good.

1:21:36.598 --> 1:21:40.167
Uh,
gonna give me a ride home.

1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:41.502
Anyone wanna come?

1:21:41.536 --> 1:21:43.937
Um, no I think our parents
are coming soon.

1:21:45.372 --> 1:21:46.373
Barb?

1:21:49.276 --> 1:21:50.144
Yeah.

1:21:52.413 --> 1:21:54.381
- Hey, um, I'll text you.
- Yeah.

1:21:54.415 --> 1:21:55.282
Okay.

1:22:01.989 --> 1:22:03.190
It's good to see you, Barb.

1:22:06.260 --> 1:22:08.395
I'll call you tomorrow.

1:22:09.363 --> 1:22:10.397
Word.

1:22:13.333 --> 1:22:15.703
Big!

1:22:15.737 --> 1:22:17.137
Bye, Terry.

1:22:26.346 --> 1:22:27.247
Are you okay?

1:22:28.750 --> 1:22:29.617
Yeah.

1:22:32.419 --> 1:22:36.558
Leave it to us to make a peaceful weekend
getaway and then bloodshed, right?

1:22:41.028 --> 1:22:44.398
So, I guess you're just
gonna move back home?

1:22:45.667 --> 1:22:48.335
Yeah, I think so,
for a little bit, at least.

1:22:50.137 --> 1:22:52.406
You know mom's trying
cooking again, right?

1:22:52.439 --> 1:22:54.074
Oh, no.

1:22:54.107 --> 1:22:55.710
No, maybe we should stay away.

1:22:55.743 --> 1:22:57.444
Just maybe steer clear.

1:22:59.346 --> 1:23:01.583
No, I'm excited.
I'm excited to go home.

1:23:02.282 --> 1:23:03.618
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:23:05.085 --> 1:23:08.021
I don't know, it'd be kind of nice
just to relax, you know, for a while.

1:23:08.055 --> 1:23:08.723
For a while?

1:23:09.467 --> 1:23:12.794
Okay, probably like a week and then I'll
freak out and then have panic attack

1:23:12.827 --> 1:23:16.396
and try and figure
what's going on in my life.

1:23:19.667 --> 1:23:21.068
Do you want to get lunch?

1:23:23.170 --> 1:23:24.037
What?

1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:27.809
- Like sometime this week like, do you want to go get food?
- Yes, sure.

1:23:27.842 --> 1:23:28.943
No, I mean, like,
we don't have to.

1:23:28.977 --> 1:23:31.111
- No. That's weird. I'm sorry.
- I'm just sorry, I...

1:23:31.144 --> 1:23:33.313
it's like I didn't like...

1:23:33.347 --> 1:23:35.315
So, I remember
that that was like a thing.

1:23:35.349 --> 1:23:36.416
Yeah.

1:23:36.450 --> 1:23:41.088
Um, yeah, let's do it.
Let's go to, uh, Honey Ham.

1:23:41.121 --> 1:23:42.155
No.

1:23:42.189 --> 1:23:44.057
No, no way. I hate it there.

1:23:44.091 --> 1:23:46.159
Let's go to this Mystery Diner,
our usual.

1:23:46.193 --> 1:23:47.662
- What? Are you kidding me?
- The pancakes are so good.

1:23:47.695 --> 1:23:48.830
- No, no...
- Why not?

1:23:48.863 --> 1:23:51.265
The pancakes are the reason
I dropped out of college.

1:23:51.298 --> 1:23:53.735
That's... that's just stupid.
That's not true.

1:23:53.768 --> 1:23:56.571
They have like a sanitation
score of like 13 and a half.

1:23:56.604 --> 1:23:57.872
No, it's... No.

1:23:57.906 --> 1:24:00.842
- Okay, the pancakes are huge, it's probably out of 15.
- I know.

1:24:00.875 --> 1:24:02.544
- Out of 15? Yeah.
- And they're really good.

1:24:02.577 --> 1:24:03.778
You can share them
with the whole...

1:24:03.811 --> 1:24:06.413
Sanitation scores, sanitation
scores are always out of 15.

1:24:06.446 --> 1:24:08.550
Always. Every time.
