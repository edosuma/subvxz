00:19.227 --> 00:20.353
[woman crying]

00:20.437 --> 00:23.773
-[woman whining indistinctly]
-Come on, now, they're all waiting.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.901
No, Mom! No!

00:26.985 --> 00:29.404
Sweetheart, it's all right.

00:29.487 --> 00:32.449
If you don't love Kevin yet, you will.

00:32.699 --> 00:33.742
We all will.

00:33.825 --> 00:34.951
[sobbing]

00:35.035 --> 00:36.995
[whining indistinctly]

00:37.078 --> 00:39.205
Nobody can understand you, sweetie.

00:39.456 --> 00:43.126
I think she said, "It's the chest."
She's always been really top heavy.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.754
It's the dress!

00:45.837 --> 00:47.005
[all] Oh.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.923
I want the vintage beaded one.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.469
She told me it'd be here on time.
She promised me.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.972
That's what you get
for ordering it online.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.184
The Internet should only be used
to forward prayer chains

00:59.267 --> 01:01.144
and make jokes about the Clintons.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.980
Mom! How is that helpful?

01:04.898 --> 01:10.028
Look, everybody here thinks
you look better in this dress.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.738
You're breathtaking.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.907
-[woman 2] You're stunning.
-Eh...

01:13.990 --> 01:15.742
-Really?
-[woman 2] You're glowing.

01:18.828 --> 01:19.829
[exhales, sniffles]

01:21.498 --> 01:25.960
I swear to God, I'm gonna tear
that fuckin' Nasty Gal apart.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.463
[sighs]

01:30.673 --> 01:32.133
Okay. I'm ready.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.261
We've got movement.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.772
Just lick my ass.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.733
Was that directed at me?

01:48.817 --> 01:52.529
Oh, no. Talking about ladyshopper99.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.825
This bitch thinks she can get a refund
with some weak sauce excuse?

01:57.408 --> 02:00.161
"Dress is discolored." Please.
I know that shit was perfect.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.998
You wanna come at me, you best kill me.
Otherwise, I'm gonna fuck up your world!

02:04.499 --> 02:06.543
Hi. I'm Sophia.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.212
I'm Nathan.
And I love everything you just said.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.340
Well, goodbye forever.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.676
-What do you mean?
-Okay, I'll tell you.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.720
I can't afford
to be a student here anymore.

02:18.930 --> 02:19.889
Sorry, I just...

02:20.598 --> 02:24.102
I have a lot of creative energy,
and I don't know how to channel it.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.479
Not on my own, you know? I wanna...

02:26.563 --> 02:29.232
I wanna make art
that makes you feel something.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.485
Like when you look
at Monet's <i>Water Lilies</i>,

02:32.694 --> 02:34.612
or Van Gogh's <i>Starry Night</i>.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.906
Or... this.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.035
Take it in.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.163
You're not going anywhere.

02:43.955 --> 02:44.789
What do you mean?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.208
No one who feels as passionately as you do

02:47.292 --> 02:50.086
should be kept from a place like this
because of money.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.755
Not if I can do anything about it,
which I can.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.425
You're gonna give me $20,000?

02:55.508 --> 02:57.969
[chuckling] No, man. Come on. Please.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.222
I'm just gonna let you in. Give me this.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.766
Wait. You would risk your livelihood

03:03.850 --> 03:05.935
just so you could help me
pursue my dreams?

03:06.519 --> 03:07.395
Sure.

03:08.062 --> 03:11.482
I only got this job
so I can afford hernia surgery.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.152
Like so many other young vibrant women.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.904
My uncle had a hernia.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.947
-Hm.
-He's dead now.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.408
-Not from the hernia.
-Oh.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.036
[whispering] From complications with it.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.041
So, what do you think? Is it art?

03:29.083 --> 03:30.585
-Yes?
-Yeah.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.921
-It is.
-Mm.

03:34.005 --> 03:34.839
Or is it?

03:37.550 --> 03:38.384
It's not?

03:40.553 --> 03:41.387
Is it?

03:45.683 --> 03:47.477
-No, seriously, is it?
-Oh...

03:47.560 --> 03:49.979
I need you to tell me,
because the teacher said it wasn't.

03:50.063 --> 03:50.980
Oh.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.775
-Please. Definitely art.
-Ah.

03:54.108 --> 03:54.943
Thank you.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.491
[Annie] You know, I wish I could say
that was the first time

04:01.574 --> 04:05.662
that I accidentally stepped on a baby,
but, oh, I buried the lead.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.790
They opened a Jamba across from my waxer.

04:08.873 --> 04:12.210
So, earlier today I was able to pop by
for a quick sip and rip.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.254
[gasps] Oh!

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
Oh, I wanna be inside you.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.300
Discolored?
Does this dress look discolored to you?

04:19.384 --> 04:22.136
'Cause to me,
this color be a coffee stain.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.805
I'm loving your energy right now.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.557
Ladyshopper99 clearly spilled coffee
on this dress,

04:26.641 --> 04:28.142
and then had the nerve to send it back.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.062
Well, stained, discolored, whatever it is,

04:31.145 --> 04:32.146
it's mine now.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.317
Oh, my God, this dress is heaven.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.904
I could so walk down the aisle
wearing this.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.990
-And marry who?
-I don't know.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.534
Dax? Buzz Aldrin? Your dad?

04:44.617 --> 04:47.412
I'm gonna let that go
because I'm pissed at someone else.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.123
God, I wanna fuck an astronaut so bad.

04:50.748 --> 04:54.043
Hey, unrelated,
have you seen<i> Failure to Launch?</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:55.003
Mm-mm.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.422
It's an okay movie,
but then they go play paintball,

04:57.505 --> 05:00.550
and, no joke, it goes on
for, like, two and a half hours.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.761
Okay. Listen to this malarkey.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.930
"We've been working tirelessly

05:06.014 --> 05:08.891
to set up the home
for my wedding this Saturday."

05:08.975 --> 05:10.727
Blah, blah, blah.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.645
"Now I have to find a replacement dress,

05:12.729 --> 05:15.481
but when I find the time,
expect a scathing review."

05:15.606 --> 05:17.025
Eh--? Wh--? Uh--?

05:17.108 --> 05:20.403
Shit. I just started this thing.
She cannot do this to me.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.323
There's no small chance
you just missed the stain?

05:23.406 --> 05:25.074
-Hell no.
-Okay.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.037
But this isn't about me being right
or her being a lying sack of shit.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.457
Okay. I know what I'm gonna do.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.669
I will assure ladyshopper99
that I can get the dress cleaned

05:36.753 --> 05:39.255
and back in her arms before the wedding.

05:39.338 --> 05:43.718
Or you let me keep the dress
and you kill ladyshopper99.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.802
Hmm...

05:45.094 --> 05:48.139
Here's the thing.
You get caught, you go to jail.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.266
But you're released early
for good behavior.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.644
I'm there to pick you up,
I'm wearing the dress. Bad decision.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.564
But you don't say anything at first,
so, I think I'm off the hook.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.317
But then, out from behind your back,

05:59.400 --> 06:02.445
I think you're gonna pull a knife,
and it's a bouquet.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.946
And Buzz Aldrin is there,

06:04.030 --> 06:07.909
and you've organized my wedding
on the day of your prison release.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.161
You're a really good friend.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.293
Yep, that's definitely a stain.
Looks recent.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.211
I knew it.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.504
My first guess was coffee,

06:19.587 --> 06:21.923
but on closer inspection,
I'm positive it's Coke.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.091
Hm.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.428
-Diet Coke.
-Do you think you could get it out?

06:27.512 --> 06:29.472
Miss... we are the best.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.433
You want the worst,
you go to my brother's.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.686
-You want the best, stay where you are.
-Got it.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.189
I thought all dry cleaners
were pretty much the same.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.943
That kind of statement would be hurtful
to a less confident man.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.405
[clicks tongue] So, Diet Coke, huh?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.323
Yes, I will get this out, no problem.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.242
The dress will be ready end
of the day Friday.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.077
Whoa. That's cutting it a little close.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.955
Do you think you could have it faster,
since you're the best?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.750
End of the day Friday.
Anywhere else would take longer.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.419
My shit brother's place? Two weeks.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.880
Jesus, what the hell happened
between you and your brother?

07:04.298 --> 07:07.718
[sighs] He is the worst.

07:07.802 --> 07:11.389
Shouldn't have taken the bait. Okay.
I'll be back to pick this up on Friday.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.225
Thank you. You are in good hands.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.769
-Edwin, don't you mean the best?
-Best hands.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.854
-Yes.
-Yes.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.025
[Imogen Heap's "Hallelujah" playing on TV]

07:40.334 --> 07:41.794
[Dax] What's wrong with Melissa?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.129
It's Marissa.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.466
If you wanna live to see another
Chrismukkah, shut your pretty mouth.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.760
-Aw, you're too cute to--
-I'm not fucking kidding around.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.763
All right. All right, cool it.
He's got her out of the car.

07:52.847 --> 07:56.017
They'll kiss, she'll smile,
we'll check in with Seth and Summer

07:56.100 --> 07:58.019
because they're way more interesting.

07:58.102 --> 08:02.356
And then they'll head home and get
a great big hug from Peter Eyebrows.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.442
God, I hope you're right. [sighs]

08:04.525 --> 08:06.402
<i>Marissa. Marissa.</i>

[phone buzzing]

08:10.948 --> 08:12.033
Who the hell?

08:13.117 --> 08:15.036
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.039
-Nasty Gal Vintage, Sophia speaking.
-What?

08:18.122 --> 08:18.956
Yep.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.252
Ladyshopper99,
I am so happy you still want the dress.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.715
Yes. Oh, please, no, no, no.
You live so close.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.885
I promise you I will have that dress ready

08:30.968 --> 08:33.804
and in your hands
well before you walk down the aisle.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.557
What is happening?
Somebody do something.

08:38.184 --> 08:42.355
Yes. Discolorations can be difficult
to see in certain kinds of light.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.689
Great suggestion.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.483
I will have my bulbs looked at.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.070
<i>-Marissa.</i>
-[Sophia] No, <i>you're</i> right.

08:49.862 --> 08:50.696
Oh, my God.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.783
Oh, shit, she's dead?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.577
That Melissa chick important?

08:57.495 --> 09:01.332
Yeah. She's not just, like,
a character on a show, okay?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.168
-She's also really pretty.
-Thank you so, so much.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.337
-Sophia? Sophia.
-Thank you. We'll talk soon.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.130
-Bye-bye. Have a good one.
-[Annie] Sophia.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.299
Sophia. They killed her.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.135
Those monsters killed her.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.055
I cannot believe I had a work call

09:16.138 --> 09:19.475
during the most significant TV event
of our lifetime.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.895
I hope this means they make
Taylor Townsend a regular next year.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.232
Who the fuck likes Taylor Townsend?

09:28.818 --> 09:30.319
-[Sophia] ID, please.
-[girl 1] Thanks.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.988
[Sophia] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.656
-[girl 2] Thanks.
-[Sophia] ID, please.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.033
Thank you. Proceed.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.369
Look at us breaking the law.

09:38.452 --> 09:39.620
[both chuckle]

09:39.704 --> 09:42.290
The funny thing is
I'm not allowed in Blockbuster, either.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.750
I rented <i>Cider House Rules</i>.
Never returned it.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.670
I was trying to get my Michael Caine down.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.214
[imitating Caine]
"These be the rules of the Cider House."

09:50.298 --> 09:51.299
[laughing]

09:51.382 --> 09:52.258
Whoa.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.136
Promise me you'll say hi to me
in that voice every morning.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.929
As you wish, Sophia.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.974
[in normal voice] Oh, my God.
Did you watch <i>The OC </i>last night?

10:00.057 --> 10:03.436
-[sighs] Of course.
-Like, I literally just stopped crying.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.063
My mother started
a "Save Marissa" petition online.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.608
-You watch it with your mother?
-Of course. I live with her.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.277
-Oof. I'm sorry.
-Why? I love it.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.696
We cook together, we drink together,

10:13.779 --> 10:15.948
we spy on our shady neighbor together.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.533
Those apron strings are tight.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.535
No offense, but that's nuts.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.163
Sophia, you must come to my house
for dinner tonight.

10:22.246 --> 10:25.082
A home-cooked meal is the least I can do
to repay you.

10:25.166 --> 10:29.128
Thanks, but I have to deal with
that customer wedding dress return thing.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.588
Well, if you change your mind,

10:30.671 --> 10:33.758
we are the big gay house right across
from the 7-Eleven.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.051
Oh!

10:40.056 --> 10:42.099
You got the stain out. Here you go.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.227
Now, we had a small hiccup
with the beads,

10:45.311 --> 10:47.730
but I crawled around on the floor
for hours,

10:47.813 --> 10:49.565
making sure I retrieved each
and every one.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.860
Dude, what the hell?
I have a messenger coming

10:52.943 --> 10:56.572
to pick this up, like, right now.
I should have gone to your brother's.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.157
-You don't mean that.
-Yes, I do.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.618
I'm gonna have to reschedule,
get a new pickup time.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.829
-You could always deliver it yourself.

I'm gonna need a Diet Coke

-Sophia?
-Sophia!

-Come in.

[both] Come in, come in, come in.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.357
-This is for you.
-For me?

24:44.441 --> 24:46.151
Yeah. Thanks for covering me at work.

24:46.234 --> 24:50.697
-It was super cool of you.
-Oh, Sophia. It was a pleasure

24:50.780 --> 24:56.328
and an exhilaration to be you for a day
and see art through a non-artist's eyes.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.788
Okay. Again, thanks.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.293
And since I sweated my ass off
in this thing, I cleaned it...

25:03.960 --> 25:07.839
-and jazzed it up a bit.
-Oh, my God. Well...

-[Nathan] Wow.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.638
Yeah.

25:14.721 --> 25:18.308
Well, it's the least I could do after
being such a Nancy Miller this morning.

25:18.391 --> 25:21.686
Stop it. You didn't "borrow"
my rice cooker for two years.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.482
Did you get your dress back in time?

25:25.732 --> 25:26.858
Yeah, just barely.

25:26.942 --> 25:27.901
Was she happy?

25:28.235 --> 25:29.277
I don't know.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.278
We'll see.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.406
Well, either way, I'm proud of you.

25:33.990 --> 25:34.991
[Sofia] Mm.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.041
Ooh.

Hey, Dad.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.210
It's me.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.256
I've been wanting to tell you
that I got a job.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.925
Like... a real one.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.553
Where I'll get health insurance
and everything.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.180
Oh, and, um...

26:41.016 --> 26:42.726
I sold a dress online...

26:43.602 --> 26:44.603
for a lot of money.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.605
Like, real American dollars.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.234
And I've been doing really good.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.738
Well, Superman does good...

27:03.621 --> 27:04.456
I miss you.
