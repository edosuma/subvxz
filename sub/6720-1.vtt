02:15.177 --> 02:18.380
Brother Ignacio?
What are you doing?

02:19.515 --> 02:21.756
Five rings, padre.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.763
To summon Zorro
in case there's trouble.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.553
If I know Zorro, he's already here.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.994
Aren't you supposed to be
in school?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.078
Padre, what if Zorro comes?

03:27.290 --> 03:30.457
I'll make sure he carves a Z on
your backside. How's that sound?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.454
Really?

03:41.429 --> 03:43.505
A landslide in favour of statehood.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.344
Let's hope the rest of California
voted the same, huh?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.302
Take this to the governor.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.639
Hermano, be careful.
Our future's in your hands.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.688
I pray that the other provinces
have been as peaceful as ours.

04:22.261 --> 04:25.796
The latest model in heavy artillery,
the Henry repeater.

04:26.265 --> 04:30.049
If God didn't hurl lightning,
he'd surely carry one of these.

04:30.269 --> 04:31.680
State your business, McGivens.

04:33.355 --> 04:34.470
I haven't voted yet.

04:35.816 --> 04:38.733
I'm sorry, you're too late.
The polls have already closed.

04:38.944 --> 04:42.811
Now, that doesn't seem equitable.
I have rights too.

04:43.282 --> 04:47.066
Now, if you'd be kind enough,
hand me that box, I'll be on my way.

04:47.661 --> 04:50.697
You'd only force the people
to vote again.

04:50.914 --> 04:54.746
Well, you remember that Babylon
was condemned to ashes...

04:54.960 --> 04:58.245
...for extending its empire
to inferior races!

04:58.797 --> 05:02.296
I come to deliver the Lord's work
against this vote.

05:23.655 --> 05:25.778
Time to do the Lord's work.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.908
Zorro! Zorro! Zorro!

05:44.342 --> 05:47.129
Move it. Move it. Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

07:48.590 --> 07:49.965
Get him!

10:40.134 --> 10:42.423
Over the hill
to the governor's mansion.

10:43.638 --> 10:47.256
I said, over the hill
to the governor's mansion!

10:51.688 --> 10:53.810
We really have to work
on your English.

11:09.497 --> 11:12.533
Zorro! Zorro! Zorro!

11:23.803 --> 11:26.210
What happened?
Where are my men?

11:26.430 --> 11:29.135
They were held up, governor.
I offered my help.

11:44.740 --> 11:46.898
Citizens of San Mateo!

11:47.117 --> 11:50.321
Today we have voted
to join the Union as a free state!

11:54.124 --> 11:57.244
But this is only the beginning.
In three months...

11:57.461 --> 12:01.328
...every vote of every pueblo
around California will be counted!

12:01.757 --> 12:05.624
And it is my hope that we will
finally call ourselves...

12:05.844 --> 12:07.671
...Americans!

12:58.354 --> 12:59.635
Good boy.

13:13.411 --> 13:16.697
Your saddle is getting
a little too tight, amigo.

13:46.819 --> 13:48.479
Tell me we won.

13:49.030 --> 13:50.737
Tell me we are free.

13:51.782 --> 13:53.442
We're free.

13:56.871 --> 13:59.444
- To statehood.
- To us.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.786
I wish I was there today.

14:05.379 --> 14:06.957
You were.

14:09.466 --> 14:11.755
I cannot believe it.

14:12.344 --> 14:14.253
We have our lives back.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.344
Now we can take Joaquin
to a trip to Spain.

14:17.558 --> 14:19.301
I cannot imagine
how it has changed.

14:19.518 --> 14:21.178
- Elena...
- And New York.

14:21.395 --> 14:23.802
You should see
New York, Alejandro.

14:24.022 --> 14:28.601
It's as if the whole world
has moved onto one tiny island.

14:28.819 --> 14:30.479
Elena, I've been thinking and...

14:30.696 --> 14:32.653
Never a good sign.

14:33.782 --> 14:37.862
Listen, California won't really be
a state for another three months.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.109
Yes?

14:39.329 --> 14:43.493
The federal marshals may need help
keeping things under control until then.

14:45.043 --> 14:48.957
Look, I know what you're thinking...
Elena. Elena, listen, listen.

14:49.172 --> 14:53.668
No, here is me, here is quitting.
We're this far apart. Elena.

14:56.221 --> 15:00.266
I cannot believe it.
I cannot believe I fell for it.

15:01.351 --> 15:04.802
Husband promises to quit,
gullible wife believes him.

15:05.021 --> 15:07.061
How could I be so stupid?

15:07.274 --> 15:08.981
Oh, Elena, you're overreacting.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.936
I'm overreacting?

15:12.153 --> 15:13.529
You made a promise.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.980
- We made a promise.
- I know.

15:16.199 --> 15:17.990
You are missing
your son's entire life.

15:18.201 --> 15:20.953
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am not missing anything.

15:21.162 --> 15:22.538
- Oh, really?
- Really.

15:22.872 --> 15:24.580
What is his teacher's name?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.578
That's an easy one.
Mister... Brother...

15:27.794 --> 15:30.960
Father Kin... Jin... Hoofer?

15:32.173 --> 15:34.249
So I have a bad memory.
What does that prove?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.875
That you do not know your own son.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.553
And even worse,
he does not know you.

15:40.932 --> 15:42.556
What would you rather have me do?

15:42.767 --> 15:45.637
Live my life as a wealthy don?
Order servants around all day?

15:45.853 --> 15:49.803
Is that what you think I do, huh?
Order servants around all day?

15:50.024 --> 15:52.729
No, no, don't twist my words.
People still need Zorro.

15:52.944 --> 15:56.277
No, no, no. You need Zorro.

15:57.031 --> 15:59.652
Look me in the eyes
and tell me that is not true.

16:06.707 --> 16:09.744
You remember what you said
the day Joaquin was born?

16:11.504 --> 16:14.837
"My family is my life."

16:15.174 --> 16:20.334
Do you know how lucky you are
to have made it this far? Alive?

16:20.805 --> 16:23.426
That your enemies have not
discovered who we are?

16:25.476 --> 16:30.636
For 10 years, you have fought
to give California its freedom.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.098
Why can't you give us ours?

16:47.414 --> 16:49.122
They are calling you.

16:51.835 --> 16:55.204
It's who I am, Elena. It's who I am.

16:59.927 --> 17:01.884
What happened to the man
I married?

17:02.095 --> 17:04.717
What happened to the woman
who used to fight by my side?

17:04.931 --> 17:06.342
She had a son.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.470
So he'll grow up to be
a nice little aristocrat...

17:09.685 --> 17:11.560
...who has no idea
where he came from...

17:11.771 --> 17:15.141
...and doesn't care about anyone
but himself. Beautiful.

17:17.359 --> 17:21.939
If you walk out that door,
you are not sleeping here tonight.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.900
Maybe I'll just take my suitcase.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.199
I hope you and Tornado
are very happy together.

17:31.416 --> 17:32.994
We will be.

17:34.878 --> 17:36.158
I love you.

18:48.117 --> 18:50.489
I spy with my little eye...

18:50.703 --> 18:53.988
...something beginning with H.

18:54.206 --> 18:56.080
Why wasn't Papi at breakfast?

18:56.292 --> 18:58.498
I told you. He left early on business.

18:58.711 --> 19:01.202
He always goes on business.

19:01.714 --> 19:03.089
Yes, he does.

19:03.841 --> 19:05.121
What exactly does he do?

19:05.926 --> 19:09.924
Well, he is a don.
And he meets with other dons...

19:10.139 --> 19:12.843
...and they discuss land
and investments...

19:13.058 --> 19:15.514
...and it's all very important work.

19:15.727 --> 19:17.886
So he sits around with friends
counting money.

19:18.105 --> 19:21.972
Oh, Joaquin. You should not be
so hard on your father.

19:22.192 --> 19:24.730
You are more like him
than you think.

19:25.153 --> 19:27.644
We can talk more about this later,
all right?

19:30.158 --> 19:31.190
I love you.

21:10.090 --> 21:11.253
Who are you?

21:11.467 --> 21:14.883
The real question, Señora de la Vega,
is who are you?

21:15.095 --> 21:17.384
The devoted wife of a wealthy don?

21:17.598 --> 21:22.390
Or an independent woman held
captive by her husband's secrets?

21:24.521 --> 21:26.229
What do you want?

21:27.316 --> 21:28.395
Your help.

21:40.162 --> 21:41.573
One?

21:41.788 --> 21:44.825
I tell you, de la Vega,
women say they want one thing...

21:45.250 --> 21:47.492
...but what they really want
is everything else.

21:48.962 --> 21:53.256
Think of this as a vacation
from the shackles of matrimony.

21:53.467 --> 21:55.258
Isn't it possible
our wives marry us...

21:55.469 --> 21:58.256
...because they want to spend
some time with their husbands?

22:02.392 --> 22:04.100
So let me understand this.

22:04.311 --> 22:05.722
If I take your advice...

22:05.937 --> 22:09.982
...I can look forward to spending my
days pruning in a tub of naked men?

22:12.611 --> 22:14.520
Thanks for the advice. But no.

22:16.072 --> 22:17.650
Where are you going?

22:18.033 --> 22:20.156
To beg Elena's forgiveness.

22:20.744 --> 22:22.286
Goodness me.

22:22.579 --> 22:25.615
Might one of you be
Don Alejandro de la Vega?

22:26.499 --> 22:27.495
Yes.

22:28.334 --> 22:33.127
Phineas Gendler, attorney at law.
I'm here on behalf of your wife.

22:33.339 --> 22:36.922
If you should have any questions,
my address is on the letterhead.

22:37.135 --> 22:38.463
Good day, sir.

22:38.678 --> 22:40.089
Gentlemen.

23:10.877 --> 23:11.956
I'm sorry, señor.

23:12.169 --> 23:15.621
But you told me to make sure
you didn't sleep past 2 today.

23:18.050 --> 23:20.672
- What's today?
- Wednesday.

23:21.929 --> 23:24.503
Of course.
I have to pick up Joaquin.

23:26.642 --> 23:27.923
What happened to my clothes?

23:28.144 --> 23:31.678
I removed them last night
so you wouldn't catch pneumonia.

23:32.231 --> 23:33.642
You removed them?

23:33.858 --> 23:37.689
After you came back from the cantina,
you went for a swim.

23:38.863 --> 23:39.942
In my clothes?

23:41.740 --> 23:45.109
- This hotel doesn't have a pool.
- We have a fountain.

23:46.912 --> 23:49.699
I see. Well, thank you, Lupe.

23:49.915 --> 23:52.121
Perhaps you just can
turn around, eh?

23:59.383 --> 24:01.126
I'll see you at confession, my child.

24:04.805 --> 24:07.557
Don't look at me like that.
I know what you're gonna say.

24:07.766 --> 24:11.016
No. No, I came here to lift
your spirits, not to dampen them.

24:11.228 --> 24:12.852
Who said my spirit needed lifting?

24:14.147 --> 24:16.473
Alejandro, you are being
a pig-headed fool.

24:16.692 --> 24:18.768
Why don't you just tell Elena
you were wrong.

24:18.986 --> 24:21.062
She's the one who wanted me
to live a lie.

24:21.279 --> 24:22.904
To stop being myself.

24:23.115 --> 24:25.403
As if California could
live without me.

24:25.617 --> 24:28.286
Wake up. I haven't had to
ring that bell in three months.

24:28.495 --> 24:30.903
- You should be rejoicing.
- I am rejoicing!

24:31.123 --> 24:34.040
All right. You cannot
rot in this room forever.

24:34.251 --> 24:37.370
A vineyard is opening tonight.
You're coming to the party with me.

24:37.587 --> 24:39.959
My whole life is a party.
Thank you, no.

24:40.173 --> 24:41.502
Be at the lobby at 8.

24:41.716 --> 24:45.168
And don't bother coming to confession,
because I'll never forgive you.

24:46.262 --> 24:47.887
You'd blackmail my soul, eh?

24:49.307 --> 24:51.264
Hell, yes.

24:56.314 --> 25:00.063
Now, would anyone else
like to interrupt my lecture...

25:00.276 --> 25:03.028
...by asking to go to the bathroom?

25:04.030 --> 25:05.489
No.

25:08.826 --> 25:10.784
Who can tell me
what this word means?

25:13.164 --> 25:14.789
Joaquin?

25:17.126 --> 25:19.249
Joaquin de la Vega!

25:22.006 --> 25:25.707
Perhaps you can tell the class
what statehood means to you.

25:28.471 --> 25:31.804
No more exploitation
of the peasants by the rich...

25:32.016 --> 25:35.966
...who oppress us
with a flaming poker of injustice.

25:36.187 --> 25:40.137
And how exactly does a flaming poker
fit into your little theory?

25:40.691 --> 25:42.269
It fits...

25:43.194 --> 25:44.818
...in your butt.

25:53.954 --> 25:56.492
Now I will give you something
to laugh about.

26:02.338 --> 26:03.666
Come here.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.091
No?

26:26.904 --> 26:29.359
Joaquin! Joaquin! Joaquin!

26:45.505 --> 26:47.545
Get back inside!

26:57.017 --> 26:58.511
Joaquin.

27:02.189 --> 27:03.599
So, what's with you, huh?

27:03.815 --> 27:06.602
You're lucky Father Quintero
didn't throw you out for good.

27:07.444 --> 27:10.895
Stop making excuses.
Why do you keep picking fights?

27:11.114 --> 27:14.150
You don't understand.
Sometimes you have to fight.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.360
Oh, really? Says who?

27:16.578 --> 27:17.776
Says him.

27:22.500 --> 27:26.284
Listen, if Zorro were here, he'll tell you
fighting isn't always the answer.

27:26.796 --> 27:28.374
How do you know what he'd say?

27:28.590 --> 27:30.915
Trust me, I know him a lot better
than you think.

27:31.134 --> 27:33.885
No, you don't.
You never been in a fight in your life.

27:34.095 --> 27:35.720
You didn't even fight to keep Mom.

27:36.556 --> 27:39.592
I am your father, little man.
Don't talk to me like that.

27:39.809 --> 27:43.593
There's nothing on earth I wouldn't do
for you or your mother. Understand?

27:44.105 --> 27:45.896
Don Alejandro.

27:46.482 --> 27:47.727
Don Alejandro.

27:48.484 --> 27:49.943
Guillermo.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.316
- Blanca.
- Hello.

27:57.326 --> 27:59.449
Look at little José. Poor thing.

27:59.662 --> 28:01.619
He's as ugly as his mother.

28:02.164 --> 28:06.032
Look at Joaquin.
You're growing up so fast.

28:06.252 --> 28:10.036
If business keeps up, we'll be able to
pay you back sooner than we thought.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.961
I told you, it was a gift.
To celebrate your son's birth.

28:13.926 --> 28:17.295
Hey, señor.
That knife is only 2 dollars.

28:20.808 --> 28:23.381
Well, I'll give you 500 for it.

28:23.602 --> 28:27.137
And for that, I'll take the deed to your
rancho, with the Lord's gratitude.

28:27.356 --> 28:30.310
We've already told you,
we'll never sell.

28:32.444 --> 28:36.608
Family man like you might wanna
keep his woman on a shorter leash.

28:37.199 --> 28:38.990
They said they are not selling, sir.

28:43.205 --> 28:45.494
Have we met before, sir?

28:46.959 --> 28:49.082
I would remember a man
with wooden teeth.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.129
And I'd remember a Mex-breed
dressed like a white man.

28:54.091 --> 28:57.294
You think your pappy's gonna crow,
little man? Or is he gonna cluck?

28:57.511 --> 28:58.507
Leave him out of...

29:04.268 --> 29:08.680
Señor, as a gentleman, I am obliged
to teach my son to turn the o...

29:09.606 --> 29:11.184
You mean that cheek?

29:11.400 --> 29:12.858
Is everything all right, boys?

29:15.237 --> 29:17.063
Respects to you, officer.

29:17.989 --> 29:19.187
Respects, respects.

29:22.786 --> 29:28.076
Think about my offer, or I'll
be obliged to do the Lord's work.

30:11.793 --> 30:14.165
Ten minutes, then I'm going.

30:16.130 --> 30:18.004
Effervescent, yet tenacious.

30:18.216 --> 30:20.541
I thought you were forbidden to drink.
What the...?

30:20.760 --> 30:23.333
I need at least one vice
to keep in touch with sinners.

30:23.554 --> 30:25.761
Whatever.
Who owns this vineyard anyway?

30:25.973 --> 30:28.760
A count recently in from France.

30:28.976 --> 30:31.514
I'm told he purchased it
from Don Gallo's widow.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.009
French count, you say?

30:33.230 --> 30:35.852
He's probably still in his parlour
putting on makeup.

30:36.108 --> 30:38.017
Or his perfume, perhaps.

30:39.820 --> 30:42.109
Rumour has it they invented it
to avoid bathing.

30:45.367 --> 30:46.363
And you are...?

30:47.828 --> 30:49.951
De la Vega. Alejandro de la Vega.

30:50.414 --> 30:52.323
You're de la Vega.

30:52.541 --> 30:55.376
What an honour.
I've heard so much about you.

30:55.586 --> 30:57.578
Really? From whom?

30:58.631 --> 31:01.168
You know, I'd love to
continue this conversation...

31:01.383 --> 31:04.218
...but I'm wanted elsewhere.
Please excuse me.

31:25.198 --> 31:27.321
I just met the most charming fellow.

31:27.534 --> 31:28.779
And who might that be?

31:29.161 --> 31:32.779
Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome.

31:33.290 --> 31:35.615
I still don't know why
they call it a winetasting.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.827
After two glasses
you can't taste anything.

31:38.712 --> 31:41.832
Friends, Californians.

31:42.048 --> 31:46.924
This vineyard represents what I hope
will become an industry...

31:47.137 --> 31:50.173
...that depends on the people
for its success.

31:50.390 --> 31:53.344
Involving them
instead of exploiting them.

31:57.731 --> 32:01.230
That's what America means to me.

32:01.443 --> 32:05.939
The promise of a country
by the people, for the people!

32:11.161 --> 32:14.695
A country blessed
with limitless beauty.

32:15.623 --> 32:19.206
But none more stunning
than my escort for the evening.

32:19.711 --> 32:21.371
Ladies and gentlemen...

32:21.588 --> 32:23.414
...Señora Elena de la Vega!

33:06.298 --> 33:08.754
Well, I'm pooped.
Come on, let's go.

33:08.968 --> 33:10.426
Go?

33:10.636 --> 33:14.586
I don't wanna go.
I'm having so much fun.

33:15.391 --> 33:18.095
Monsieur and Madame Lupon.

33:19.228 --> 33:20.556
- Pleasure, madame.
- Thank you.

33:21.105 --> 33:22.729
Very nice to meet you.

33:24.650 --> 33:26.441
- Alejandro.
- Elena.

33:26.944 --> 33:29.435
- Armand.
- De la Vega.

33:30.489 --> 33:32.695
- Count.
- You know each other?

33:33.367 --> 33:36.119
We shared a giggle
at the buffet table.

33:36.328 --> 33:38.119
It seems that's not all
we have shared.

33:38.497 --> 33:41.664
Allow me to defuse
an awkward situation.

33:41.875 --> 33:44.662
Elena has portrayed you as a man
of impeccable character.

33:44.878 --> 33:46.752
I am honoured
to be mentioned at all.

33:46.964 --> 33:50.249
Why, I nearly forgot we were still
married only three months ago.

33:50.467 --> 33:52.460
A blessing on your vineyard, count.

33:52.678 --> 33:54.836
Thank you for inviting us,
but we have a Mass...

33:55.055 --> 33:58.720
Don't be rude, Felipe. I'm just dying
to know how the lovebirds met.

34:04.022 --> 34:07.687
Another time.
We have many guests to greet.

34:09.402 --> 34:10.777
Armand, good evening.

34:10.987 --> 34:13.940
Governor Riley.
You honour us with your presence.

34:14.157 --> 34:15.650
May I present my wife, Mary.

34:15.867 --> 34:18.275
Your speech was
incredibly moving, count.

34:18.495 --> 34:21.780
I'm glad you're not running for office
against my husband.

34:22.623 --> 34:25.956
I wouldn't challenge the man who's
going to lead California into the Union.

34:26.168 --> 34:29.585
I fear there may not be
much of a Union left to join, governor.

34:29.797 --> 34:31.755
Everyone, may I introduce...

34:31.966 --> 34:35.132
...Colonel R.S. Beauregard,
of the First Alabama Infantry.

34:35.344 --> 34:36.755
What brings you here, colonel?

34:36.971 --> 34:38.763
The threat of civil war, my dear.

34:38.973 --> 34:42.841
Once California joins the Union, the
Confederate states'll be outnumbered.

34:43.353 --> 34:45.760
My countrymen find that troubling.

34:45.980 --> 34:49.598
All this talk of politics, you know how
it bores me, Armand. Shall we dance?

34:49.817 --> 34:52.059
Of course. Excuse us, gentlemen.

34:52.695 --> 34:55.732
Ladies and gentlemen,
the imperial quadrille.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.866
Perhaps you shouldn't drink
on an empty stomach.

35:08.085 --> 35:11.086
Perhaps you should wear lipstick
if you're gonna act like my mother.

35:22.141 --> 35:24.050
Say the word
and I'll escort you home.

35:24.268 --> 35:26.308
- And leave your guests?
- In a heartbeat.

35:26.520 --> 35:30.933
I care for you too much to subject you
to an evening of forced smiles, Elena.

35:33.694 --> 35:36.150
You. You are the one
not acting like yourself.

35:36.363 --> 35:37.858
Since when do politics bore you?

35:38.073 --> 35:40.611
Since when did you start caring
what I think?

35:41.744 --> 35:42.942
You.

35:46.415 --> 35:48.906
If you wish,
I'll have him escorted out.

35:49.126 --> 35:50.751
I can handle him.

35:52.046 --> 35:54.334
For the love of God,
let's get out of this place.

35:54.548 --> 35:56.042
I can handle her!

35:59.136 --> 36:01.045
You must tell me how you met.

36:01.263 --> 36:04.798
Years ago, in Spain. We were
at finishing school together.

36:05.017 --> 36:07.638
Oh, how nice.
You were reunited so he could finish.

36:07.853 --> 36:09.347
Don't force me to embarrass you.

36:09.563 --> 36:11.057
Sorry, too late!

36:16.320 --> 36:21.065
So tell me, count, what does
your title rank among noblemen?

36:21.283 --> 36:23.074
It is higher than, say, a duke?

36:23.744 --> 36:26.910
Oh, it's rather common, actually.
Much like a don.

36:31.251 --> 36:35.379
Oh, he's a delight.
Rich, good-looking and royalty.

36:35.589 --> 36:37.249
What can I say
that'd make you leave?

36:37.465 --> 36:39.921
You can fall to your knees,
beg me to take you back.

36:40.135 --> 36:41.677
I wouldn't want to ruin my dress.

36:41.887 --> 36:45.053
- Good. I'm enjoying single life.
- That supposed to make me jealous?

36:45.265 --> 36:46.261
- Does it?
- Never!

36:46.474 --> 36:49.428
Who's looking after Joaquin while
his mother spends nights out?

36:49.644 --> 36:52.052
I have not spent nights out.
I haven't even told Joaquin!

36:52.272 --> 36:53.647
Now, I think you should go!

36:53.857 --> 36:55.019
- You know...
- Let me go!

36:55.233 --> 36:56.976
I finally understand
why you left me.

36:57.193 --> 36:59.565
It was beneath you to marry
a peasant like me.

36:59.779 --> 37:02.068
- You're drunk.
- Your stepfather would be proud...

37:02.282 --> 37:04.986
...to see you take your rightful place
on the arms of royalty!

37:05.201 --> 37:07.775
- Keep your voice down!
- Congratulations, Your Highness!

37:18.256 --> 37:23.214
If you didn't know me better than that,
then you never knew me at all.

37:39.485 --> 37:40.860
No.

37:43.698 --> 37:45.156
Thank you...

37:45.616 --> 37:48.866
...for your hospitality, count.

38:24.613 --> 38:27.186
Could you...? Could you...?
Could you...?

38:27.407 --> 38:29.234
Could you give me that back?

38:31.203 --> 38:34.654
Hey, hey! Cut it out!
You had enough.

38:38.627 --> 38:39.658
Stinky...

38:49.054 --> 38:52.257
Aren't you forgetting something,
estúpido?!

38:57.312 --> 38:59.352
Count Armand...

38:59.689 --> 39:04.019
...with his fancy wine
and the froufrou accent.

39:04.236 --> 39:06.857
How could Elena choose
a man like that?

39:07.197 --> 39:12.155
I'll make her want me back so badly,
she will be weeping with desire.

39:12.369 --> 39:16.449
Nobody leaves my tequila worm
dangling in the wind!

39:38.853 --> 39:40.561
Oh, my God.

40:12.011 --> 40:13.007
Thank you.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.519
God bless you, señor.

40:21.395 --> 40:22.889
How kind of you.

40:23.564 --> 40:25.687
I was trying to impress you.

40:27.485 --> 40:32.443
If you truly want to impress me,
invite me over for dinner tonight.

40:32.948 --> 40:35.190
Cook me something sinful.

40:35.659 --> 40:39.194
Why not dine at your hacienda?
I'd really like to meet your son.

40:39.747 --> 40:41.620
Please try and understand, Armand.

40:41.832 --> 40:44.537
He's not ready for another man
in my life just yet.

40:44.835 --> 40:46.958
Of course. I understand.

40:48.255 --> 40:49.714
What is it?

40:51.216 --> 40:54.301
Oh, this hat. It's breathtaking.

40:57.264 --> 41:00.134
Shall I purchase it for you?

41:00.559 --> 41:03.394
On second thought,
who needs another hat?

41:03.770 --> 41:05.348
What I need is...

41:07.774 --> 41:08.889
...a pipe!

41:09.109 --> 41:10.389
- A pipe?
- A pipe.

41:10.610 --> 41:12.235
Like my father used to smoke.

41:12.446 --> 41:15.233
I hope I do not repulse you
with my unladylike habit.

41:15.449 --> 41:18.153
No, no. On the contrary,
you fascinate me.

41:19.536 --> 41:21.196
Oh, there's a vendor.

41:21.580 --> 41:22.694
Wait here, won't you?

41:29.170 --> 41:30.415
What are you doing here?

41:30.630 --> 41:32.208
When did you start
smoking a pipe?

41:32.424 --> 41:35.590
I don't smoke. I said it to
get rid of him so I can get rid of you.

41:35.802 --> 41:38.719
- I have to talk to you about last night.
- I forgive you. Bye.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.887
No, no, no, not that. After.

41:41.224 --> 41:44.011
- I saw something in the forest.
- What are you talking about?

41:44.227 --> 41:46.765
Yes, what are you talking about?

41:48.481 --> 41:51.897
An explosion.
Close to your chateau, in fact.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.770
Like nothing I have ever seen.

41:54.654 --> 41:57.940
I simply wanted to make sure
you were both safe.

41:58.324 --> 42:02.702
As much as you had to drink last night,
I'm sure your vision was impaired.

42:03.871 --> 42:05.864
Yet somehow
it's all becoming clear.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.579
A word of advice, de la Vega:

42:10.128 --> 42:13.627
If you have any respect for the
relationship you shared with Elena...

42:13.840 --> 42:15.631
...let it die with dignity.

42:16.217 --> 42:18.969
I have to know I am losing her
to a better man.

42:19.178 --> 42:20.293
I can assure you of that.

42:20.847 --> 42:22.804
All right, that is enough.

42:23.015 --> 42:25.471
- Alejandro, time to go.
- Elena, please.

42:26.811 --> 42:30.310
Alejandro has come for peace of mind.
I am obliged to give it to him.

42:30.856 --> 42:33.976
Perhaps we can settle this
like gentlemen.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.980
You do play polo, I take it?

42:37.863 --> 42:39.192
Doesn't everyone?

42:39.448 --> 42:42.782
I suggest we play as they do
in Slovenia.

42:43.119 --> 42:45.158
- A fine city.
- Country.

42:45.830 --> 42:47.158
Naturally.

42:52.753 --> 42:56.122
- May I offer you something to drink?
- Double tequila, no salt.

43:13.857 --> 43:18.187
Perhaps a game of croquet would be
less hazardous to your health.

43:45.180 --> 43:48.845
Did you drop something?
Or you just resting?

43:51.478 --> 43:53.102
You know, I think I like this game.

43:53.313 --> 43:55.638
Promise me when you lose
you will leave us alone.

43:55.857 --> 43:57.399
What makes you think I will lose?

43:57.859 --> 43:59.318
Woman's intuition.

44:43.237 --> 44:46.357
To the victor go the spoils.

44:50.536 --> 44:52.445
Now keep your promise and go.

44:52.663 --> 44:54.288
You cheated, so I take it back.

44:54.790 --> 44:56.119
Goodbye, Alejandro.

44:56.334 --> 44:58.622
What do you really know
about this man?

45:02.340 --> 45:04.628
We were never meant
to be together.

45:12.183 --> 45:13.974
You don't love him.

45:14.185 --> 45:18.134
After 10 years of marriage,
you cannot hide the truth from me.

45:31.535 --> 45:34.986
De la Cruz is the bartender who works
at the saloon across the street.

45:35.205 --> 45:39.333
He says he overheard McGivens
gathering his men to go see Cortez.

46:34.013 --> 46:35.887
Your father asked me to pick...

47:07.130 --> 47:08.790
Cortez!

47:14.136 --> 47:16.924
The deed, if you please.

47:40.996 --> 47:43.072
- Bring it here.
- No, Guillermo, don't!

47:43.874 --> 47:46.958
Please, señor.
This land is all we have.

47:47.169 --> 47:51.297
And the Lord shall expel them
before you...

47:51.507 --> 47:54.211
...and ye shall possess their land!

47:59.848 --> 48:01.011
Salvation...

48:01.642 --> 48:02.887
...damnation.

48:03.102 --> 48:07.479
Got one thing in common.
You gotta die to find either one.

48:07.689 --> 48:09.065
How true.

48:12.361 --> 48:13.938
Drop your guns.

48:16.281 --> 48:17.989
All of you!

48:24.039 --> 48:25.830
Guillermo, Blanca, get in the house.

48:34.090 --> 48:37.839
You are one blind Mexican. You don't
know what you're getting yourself into.

48:38.887 --> 48:40.132
Neither do you.

48:46.728 --> 48:48.103
Shoot him!

48:48.313 --> 48:50.187
Let him be!

49:01.743 --> 49:04.032
- Come on!
- Let's move!

49:38.738 --> 49:40.232
Don't let them hurt you.

49:40.448 --> 49:42.357
I won't. I promise.

50:06.140 --> 50:07.931
Go on! Break it down!

52:04.966 --> 52:06.376
Blanca.

52:06.717 --> 52:08.046
Blanca.

52:38.958 --> 52:41.365
No! Guillermo!

52:42.961 --> 52:47.090
Guillermo! Guillermo.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.342
Guillermo.

52:49.551 --> 52:51.959
Guillermo, please talk to me.

52:54.556 --> 52:56.300
Talk to me!

52:56.517 --> 52:57.762
Please!

53:18.830 --> 53:21.119
What are you trying to tell me, huh?

53:21.333 --> 53:23.954
No matter what choice I make,
it's always the wrong one!

53:24.169 --> 53:25.960
I have failed everyone I ever loved.

53:26.171 --> 53:28.377
My wife, my son
and now the people too!

53:28.590 --> 53:30.214
What do you want from me?!

53:43.313 --> 53:44.807
Help me.

53:45.356 --> 53:48.026
I have always listened to my heart.

53:48.860 --> 53:51.565
And it speaks to me now
of a great darkness.

53:52.864 --> 53:55.236
I fear Guillermo Cortez
was only the beginning...

53:55.450 --> 53:57.489
...and that Elena
is in great danger too.

53:58.494 --> 54:00.202
So I beg you...

54:01.164 --> 54:04.580
...give me the courage,
the strength...

54:05.209 --> 54:07.831
...to wear the mask a little longer.

54:09.422 --> 54:11.995
Allow Zorro one last ride.

54:51.881 --> 54:52.876
Come here.

55:02.474 --> 55:04.384
She's going to the vineyard.

55:05.102 --> 55:07.558
We can post men at the gate
in case we have to pull her out.

55:07.938 --> 55:11.354
If she's compromised,
she's of no further use.

55:11.942 --> 55:14.860
Consider her an acceptable loss.

55:40.470 --> 55:42.795
Master, a word?

55:43.849 --> 55:46.470
Please, excuse me a moment.

55:50.856 --> 55:54.022
The shipment arrives
at Maderas Cove.

56:06.454 --> 56:08.826
The carving is beautiful.

56:09.332 --> 56:11.289
And what is through that door?

56:12.043 --> 56:13.621
Private chapel.

56:14.003 --> 56:17.455
Piety is a long-standing tradition
in my family.

56:17.674 --> 56:20.628
I'd show it to you,
but dinner's waiting.

56:40.405 --> 56:42.777
That was absolutely delicious.

56:44.700 --> 56:46.029
And now...

56:46.369 --> 56:49.204
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Marie,
I do not smoke.

56:50.915 --> 56:53.999
Unless it is my pipe, of course.

56:56.712 --> 57:00.164
Oh, you remembered.
How thoughtful.

57:01.133 --> 57:04.087
But I think I should let
my stomach settle first.

57:07.056 --> 57:08.467
Elena.

57:09.725 --> 57:12.014
I want to ask you something.

57:12.895 --> 57:15.516
Something I should've asked you
many years ago.

57:16.398 --> 57:21.191
Before you do, my love,
answer me one question.

57:21.570 --> 57:23.479
Whatever your heart desires.

57:25.241 --> 57:29.285
Where is the bathroom?
I would like to powder my cheeks.

57:31.121 --> 57:34.075
Of course. Down the hall.

57:34.583 --> 57:36.077
Excuse me.

58:10.911 --> 58:14.529
Excuse me, sir.
A gentleman is here to see you.

58:15.832 --> 58:17.624
He says it's important.

59:11.179 --> 59:13.634
He's building a track
to the vineyard.

59:20.855 --> 59:23.180
I presume you have the deed...

59:23.399 --> 59:26.151
...since you deemed it necessary
to interrupt my dinner.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.641
Right here.

59:27.862 --> 59:30.187
But it seems we have
a fly in the ointment.

59:30.406 --> 59:32.612
Or should I say a fox. Zorro.

59:33.159 --> 59:35.198
I've heard the name
among the locals.

59:35.411 --> 59:38.827
He's a peasant masquerading
as a folk hero.

59:39.540 --> 59:42.375
Men like that usually find their way
to the guillotine.

59:51.302 --> 59:54.884
I've been informed one of my
shipping vessels is arriving tomorrow.

59:55.097 --> 59:57.220
They'll anchor off Maderas Cove.

59:57.433 --> 01:00:00.683
The cargo must be
brought here safely.

01:00:01.562 --> 01:00:03.519
I want no mistakes.

01:00:21.373 --> 01:00:26.201
Now that we have the deed,
will the track be completed on time?

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.374
Lt'll take my boys two days
to cover the quarter mile.

01:00:29.923 --> 01:00:34.466
I'll hold you to that, Mr. McGivens.
Otherwise you get nothing.

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:39.219
Listen to me,
you backwards-ass frog...

01:00:39.432 --> 01:00:41.888
...you hedge on my money,
you won't ever see me co...

01:00:46.314 --> 01:00:49.066
This dagger, Mr. McGivens...

01:00:49.734 --> 01:00:50.897
...Jake...

01:00:51.111 --> 01:00:53.150
...has been in my family
for generations.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.900
If you ever talk to me
like that again...

01:00:57.117 --> 01:01:01.410
...I will cut out your tongue
and I'll feed it to my dogs.

01:01:02.622 --> 01:01:04.033
Understood?

01:01:14.968 --> 01:01:17.968
Your men have two days,
Mr. McGivens...

01:01:18.179 --> 01:01:20.337
...then the future begins.

01:01:21.474 --> 01:01:23.716
I trust you can find
your own way out.

01:01:42.161 --> 01:01:44.782
"Orbis unum."

01:03:06.953 --> 01:03:09.575
Alejandro! For God's sake,
why can't you leave me alone?

01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:12.993
Elena, I was right.
Armand is not who you think he is.

01:03:13.209 --> 01:03:15.665
- You have no idea who I think he is.
- I think I know.

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:18.833
No, because you do not think.
Get out before somebody sees you.

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.377
Elena, listen to me.

01:03:20.592 --> 01:03:23.261
- Guillermo Cortez is dead.
- What?

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:25.462
Armand needed his land
to build a railroad.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.222
He's planning something.

01:03:27.432 --> 01:03:28.974
How do you know this?

01:03:29.184 --> 01:03:32.469
Oh, no. I won't tell you what I know
until you tell me what you know.

01:03:32.687 --> 01:03:36.436
If you wanna know, I need to know why
you are living in sin with an evil count!

01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:37.645
Elena?

01:03:40.612 --> 01:03:42.189
Elena?

01:03:49.787 --> 01:03:51.198
There you are.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.043
Forgive me, Armand. I just had the
sudden urge to step out for a puff.

01:04:01.966 --> 01:04:03.425
Are you all right?

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:05.172
Fine.

01:04:05.386 --> 01:04:07.046
My God, you're turning green.

01:04:08.723 --> 01:04:13.764
It's just your presence
takes my breath away.

01:04:15.604 --> 01:04:21.191
Good, because I have
a little something for you.

01:04:21.819 --> 01:04:24.939
A customary Spanish offering...

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:30.070
...for when a man asks a woman
for her hand in marriage.

01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:38.126
Let me do this on one knee
so I can look up into your eyes.

01:04:38.335 --> 01:04:39.450
Oh, no, don't look up.

01:04:53.809 --> 01:04:55.303
Is that a yes?

01:04:55.519 --> 01:04:57.262
It's a definite maybe.

01:04:57.479 --> 01:05:01.180
I know it's sudden, given what
you've just been through...

01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:07.025
...but I want to give you everything
your former husband couldn't.

01:05:07.906 --> 01:05:09.946
You don't have to answer now...

01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:15.319
...but whatever you decide,
the necklace is yours.

01:05:16.248 --> 01:05:17.659
Thank you.

01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:22.956
But I have to go.
I must put Joaquin to bed.

01:05:23.964 --> 01:05:28.341
Of course.
Your children require attention.

01:05:44.484 --> 01:05:45.647
Pearls.

01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:18.423
Welcome, children, to Bear Point.

01:06:18.726 --> 01:06:20.933
It was on this desolate spot...

01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:24.728
...that our state flag
was raised for the first time.

01:06:24.941 --> 01:06:28.689
Tomorrow our governor will be
hosting a celebration here...

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:31.394
...to honour California's statehood.

01:06:31.614 --> 01:06:33.939
Joaquin de la Vega!

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:35.901
Are you paying attention?

01:06:38.287 --> 01:06:40.244
Take out your notebooks...

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:56.090
Hold up.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:16.571
Scorcher of a day, ain't it, kids?

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.708
Is there something
I can help you with, señor?

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:29.832
Don't let me interrupt
the lesson, Father.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.834
I'm just on my way
to do the Lord's work.

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.462
Mount up, boys.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.433
Come on.

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:19.176
Grab that there, will you?

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.081
Let's get to work, boys.

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:35.082
What are you doing here?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:39.086
Looking at two of the ugliest guys
I've ever seen.

01:09:55.065 --> 01:09:56.773
Come on.
Do you want a piece of me?

01:10:44.364 --> 01:10:45.822
Stay there!

01:10:53.623 --> 01:10:55.829
Orbis unum.

01:11:17.271 --> 01:11:20.687
I can't believe it's you.
You're really Zorro.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.394
And that's Tornado, right?

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:26.145
I mean, whoa.
Look at him. He's huge.

01:11:31.077 --> 01:11:32.487
It's just a scratch.

01:11:34.955 --> 01:11:37.197
So you gonna say something
or what?

01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:40.414
Let's speak in Spanish,
the language of our fathers.

01:11:40.628 --> 01:11:42.454
My mother won't believe this!

01:11:42.922 --> 01:11:46.041
No, it would be better if you didn't
tell your mother about this.

01:11:46.258 --> 01:11:47.456
Why not?

01:11:48.427 --> 01:11:49.969
I'm the one asking the questions.

01:11:50.179 --> 01:11:51.590
Now, why aren't you in school?

01:11:51.805 --> 01:11:53.715
The man with the scar on his face.

01:11:53.933 --> 01:11:55.427
I knew he was up to something.

01:11:55.643 --> 01:11:57.552
You really showed that son of a bitch.

01:11:57.978 --> 01:12:00.018
Watch your mouth.

01:12:01.065 --> 01:12:02.607
Those men are killers.

01:12:02.816 --> 01:12:05.058
Whatever they had in those crates
was very dangerous...

01:12:05.277 --> 01:12:08.064
...and now I don't know what it was, as I
was too busy getting you out of trouble.

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:12.861
You mean this?

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:17.908
Soap?!

01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:19.822
That's all there was?

01:12:20.042 --> 01:12:21.121
Lots and lots of it.

01:12:21.335 --> 01:12:22.414
Are you sure?

01:12:22.628 --> 01:12:24.252
Would I lie to you?

01:12:27.507 --> 01:12:30.378
Spanish, niño, Spanish,
and this isn't a game.

01:12:30.719 --> 01:12:33.720
Your father would have a heart attack
if he knew what you did.

01:12:34.306 --> 01:12:36.263
No, he wouldn't, he doesn't care.

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.841
Yesterday he forgot about me.

01:12:43.481 --> 01:12:45.557
No, I don't think he forgot.

01:12:46.568 --> 01:12:49.355
What you have to understand is...

01:12:52.282 --> 01:12:53.657
No.

01:12:54.451 --> 01:12:56.443
Your father should have been there.

01:12:57.412 --> 01:12:58.990
Next time he will be.

01:12:59.205 --> 01:13:00.949
How do you know?

01:13:03.126 --> 01:13:04.585
I know.

01:13:05.336 --> 01:13:06.332
I promise.

01:13:18.182 --> 01:13:20.673
A serpent circling the globe.

01:13:21.269 --> 01:13:23.974
Are you sure that this is the symbol
you saw on the crate?

01:13:26.441 --> 01:13:27.686
"Orbis unum." Yeah.

01:13:28.067 --> 01:13:30.819
It's Latin. It means "one world."

01:13:31.362 --> 01:13:33.485
It represents
the Knights of Aragon...

01:13:33.698 --> 01:13:37.197
...an ancient brotherhood that ruled
Europe in secrecy after the Crusades.

01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:40.115
Wait, wait, wait.
Armand is a knight?

01:13:42.039 --> 01:13:44.993
Some believe they are the masters
behind the kings in Europe...

01:13:45.209 --> 01:13:46.751
...even today.

01:13:47.712 --> 01:13:51.330
Here is a prophecy they wrote
nearly 1000 years ago.

01:13:52.383 --> 01:13:55.716
"There shall be a land in the west
of great power...

01:13:55.928 --> 01:13:59.214
...that shall rise to threaten
the serpent.

01:13:59.432 --> 01:14:03.928
Only by turning the power onto itself
shall the serpent survive."

01:14:06.897 --> 01:14:08.605
A land in the west.

01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:10.644
America.

01:14:12.027 --> 01:14:13.854
They want to destroy it.

01:14:15.406 --> 01:14:16.948
- With the soap?
- With the soap?

01:14:31.255 --> 01:14:32.535
Thank you.

01:14:33.715 --> 01:14:35.625
I had a wonderful time.

01:14:35.843 --> 01:14:38.049
Unfortunate that it has to end.

01:14:38.262 --> 01:14:39.637
It does?

01:14:39.846 --> 01:14:43.298
Some colleagues of mine are arriving
from Europe this evening.

01:14:43.517 --> 01:14:45.059
The meeting may run late.

01:14:46.687 --> 01:14:49.723
Perhaps we could meet
for breakfast?

01:14:51.274 --> 01:14:52.473
I cannot wait that long.

01:14:54.111 --> 01:14:56.399
I want to be your wife, Armand.

01:15:11.044 --> 01:15:13.500
If I am going to be
the lady of the house...

01:15:13.713 --> 01:15:16.418
...I want to start making myself
at home.

01:15:19.302 --> 01:15:23.929
I suppose we could have
a late supper.

01:15:26.476 --> 01:15:28.931
I will wait for you after your meeting.

01:15:30.146 --> 01:15:33.266
Then perhaps I can stay.

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.788
Excuse me.

01:16:44.053 --> 01:16:47.303
Sir! Sir! Hotel Vista Grande.

01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:53.304
What the...?

01:17:13.623 --> 01:17:14.703
Who are you?

01:17:15.083 --> 01:17:17.455
I'm Agent Pike.
This is Agent Harrigan.

01:17:17.919 --> 01:17:21.371
We're the Pinkertons. Operatives
of the United States government.

01:17:22.591 --> 01:17:24.215
So you are the good guys?

01:17:24.426 --> 01:17:27.047
We live in perilous times,
Mr. De la Vega.

01:17:27.262 --> 01:17:29.670
America's gates have been
thrown wide open...

01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:31.514
...to people from foreign lands.

01:17:31.725 --> 01:17:34.512
Which is why, on occasion,
we require certain individuals...

01:17:34.728 --> 01:17:37.301
...to aid in our country's defence.

01:17:37.522 --> 01:17:38.897
People like your ex-wife.

01:17:42.277 --> 01:17:43.736
Elena?

01:17:47.532 --> 01:17:49.026
Works for you?

01:17:50.493 --> 01:17:51.738
As a spy?

01:17:52.412 --> 01:17:54.737
Until California's statehood
becomes official...

01:17:54.956 --> 01:17:57.743
...we don't have jurisdiction to serve
Armand with a search warrant.

01:17:57.959 --> 01:18:00.082
So we needed someone
who could gain his trust.

01:18:00.295 --> 01:18:03.414
And who more suited to the task
than the woman he never forgot?

01:18:03.631 --> 01:18:05.624
Before he arrived,
we intercepted a telegram...

01:18:05.842 --> 01:18:08.415
...he'd dispatched to his associates
throughout Europe.

01:18:08.636 --> 01:18:12.764
In that telegram, he claimed to be on
the verge of producing a new weapon...

01:18:12.974 --> 01:18:15.216
...with a single target in mind.

01:18:15.518 --> 01:18:17.760
The United States of America.

01:18:20.022 --> 01:18:22.395
What kind of weapon could do that?

01:18:22.608 --> 01:18:25.278
Your ex-wife may be on the verge
to answer that question.

01:18:25.486 --> 01:18:29.104
And every time you interfere, you
jeopardize her cover. Understand?

01:18:31.993 --> 01:18:34.199
The divorce was your idea,
wasn't it?

01:18:34.412 --> 01:18:37.366
You blackmailed Elena
to lure in the count...

01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:41.116
We prefer to think of it
as a mutual understanding.

01:18:41.502 --> 01:18:43.245
She agrees to help us...

01:18:43.462 --> 01:18:47.542
...and we promise to keep the name
of Zorro secret from his enemies.

01:18:47.758 --> 01:18:50.795
A name you share
with your wife and son.

01:18:58.894 --> 01:19:01.101
I know something
that might help you.

01:19:20.082 --> 01:19:22.834
I will send you both to hell for this!

01:19:24.461 --> 01:19:28.506
Our country must be protected,
de la Vega, without apology.

01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:31.589
Zorro is a relic of the past.

01:19:32.803 --> 01:19:34.795
This belongs in a museum.

01:19:35.514 --> 01:19:37.138
So do you.

01:19:43.647 --> 01:19:45.889
Soon we will both be free.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.031
Bonsoir, Marie.
Armand is expecting me.

01:20:42.246 --> 01:20:45.532
You are early, madame.
The count is still indisposed.

01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:48.585
Well, perhaps I can wait
in the parlour.

01:21:00.348 --> 01:21:02.091
Thank you so much, Marie.

01:21:39.678 --> 01:21:42.299
Joaquin? Joaquin!

01:21:42.806 --> 01:21:44.633
Hey! Hey! Come here.

01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:46.346
Dad?

01:21:50.814 --> 01:21:52.143
What are you doing in a bar?

01:21:52.357 --> 01:21:54.480
- What are you doing in jail?
- I asked you first.

01:21:54.693 --> 01:21:57.065
I went looking everywhere for you.
It's about mom.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:00.196
- Is she okay?
- No. I mean, yes, but no.

01:22:00.407 --> 01:22:01.735
A man came to the house.

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.157
He asked her to marry him.
She said yes.

01:22:04.369 --> 01:22:07.489
I know you still love her.
You said you'd do anything for her.

01:22:07.706 --> 01:22:11.406
You can't be in jail! How can you be
in jail?! You gotta stop her.

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:13.370
Joaquin. Joaquin, listen to me.

01:22:13.587 --> 01:22:17.834
Help me out of here,
and I'll get your mother back.

01:22:19.092 --> 01:22:20.966
We'll be a family again.

01:22:22.596 --> 01:22:24.304
I promise.

01:22:27.058 --> 01:22:30.178
I promise. Now...

01:23:21.946 --> 01:23:25.362
Joaquin. Joaquin.
You are a genius, a genius.

01:23:25.574 --> 01:23:28.575
But I don't want to catch you
breaking anyone out of jail again.

01:23:28.786 --> 01:23:30.660
Without my permission, I mean.

01:23:52.309 --> 01:23:55.014
Stay back! Or I break the kid's neck!

01:23:55.229 --> 01:24:00.104
Help me! I'm too young to die!
I got my whole life ahead of me!

01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:04.529
Kill him.

01:24:21.338 --> 01:24:23.129
Where did you learn to do that?

01:24:24.633 --> 01:24:27.385
Prison changes a man, son.
Let's go.

01:24:47.822 --> 01:24:49.482
Listen, Joaquin.

01:24:50.533 --> 01:24:52.407
- I have to go alone.
- What?

01:24:52.744 --> 01:24:54.618
I just got you out of jail!

01:24:54.829 --> 01:24:56.110
What if he puts up a fight?

01:24:56.331 --> 01:24:59.118
I'm not going there to fight.
I am going to reason with him.

01:24:59.334 --> 01:25:00.532
You can't reason with him.

01:25:00.752 --> 01:25:03.788
Joaquin, the world is a little more
complicated than you think.

01:25:04.005 --> 01:25:05.832
No, it isn't.
There's right and wrong.

01:25:06.049 --> 01:25:09.003
I don't have the time
to argue with you.

01:25:11.054 --> 01:25:12.714
I'm sorry.

01:25:13.515 --> 01:25:15.139
Come, Joaquincito.

01:25:19.103 --> 01:25:21.511
You don't deserve Mom.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.126
Yeah. We're to stay put.

01:27:08.753 --> 01:27:10.793
Armand went through there.
We have to hurry.

01:27:11.006 --> 01:27:12.998
- I know about the Pinkertons.
- How?

01:27:13.216 --> 01:27:15.043
Doesn't matter.
They told me everything.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.719
It's all right, I forgive you.

01:27:16.928 --> 01:27:18.921
You forgive me? No, no.
I forgive you. You!

01:27:19.139 --> 01:27:20.799
- For what?
- Everything you put me through.

01:27:21.016 --> 01:27:24.301
You? I would not be in this mess
if you had kept your mask on.

01:27:24.519 --> 01:27:26.761
Really? Why are you
still wearing his necklace?

01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.474
I'm undercover.

01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:32.059
Besides, these are pearls.
You never gave me pearls.

01:27:32.277 --> 01:27:35.443
- You said you didn't care.
- I lied. Every woman loves pearls.

01:27:35.655 --> 01:27:37.564
Well, now you have them, princess.

01:27:38.074 --> 01:27:41.443
When I said that we were never
meant to be together, I meant it.

01:27:41.869 --> 01:27:43.827
Finally we agree on something.

01:27:54.549 --> 01:27:57.715
- This changes nothing.
- Absolutely not.

01:27:58.886 --> 01:28:01.638
- Follow me.
- Always.

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:10.428
Orbis unum.

01:28:11.023 --> 01:28:12.767
Orbis unum.

01:28:13.067 --> 01:28:15.523
Fellow Knights of Aragon...

01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:21.491
...soon the power of the United States
will be so great...

01:28:22.076 --> 01:28:24.863
...it will overshadow us.

01:28:26.247 --> 01:28:30.327
But America has one weakness:

01:28:32.211 --> 01:28:33.491
Lts people.

01:28:34.505 --> 01:28:37.210
They are divided,
by north and south.

01:28:37.424 --> 01:28:40.212
A civil war is inevitable.

01:28:40.427 --> 01:28:43.547
The only question is,
who will claim victory?

01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:47.556
We will determine the outcome...

01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:51.350
...with this:

01:28:52.481 --> 01:28:54.059
An average bar of soap.

01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.067
Quite harmless in its current form.

01:28:58.612 --> 01:29:03.737
But science has shown us
how to extract the glycerine...

01:29:04.368 --> 01:29:06.693
...and transform it
into a compound...

01:29:06.912 --> 01:29:10.577
...13 times more powerful
than gunpowder.

01:29:13.752 --> 01:29:15.330
Nitroglycerine.

01:29:18.048 --> 01:29:22.259
For months, this vineyard has been
a cover for its manufacture.

01:29:23.095 --> 01:29:26.546
Tomorrow, a shipment of nitro
will depart by train.

01:29:26.765 --> 01:29:29.719
It will be met at the state line
by Colonel Beauregard...

01:29:30.018 --> 01:29:32.141
...who will take possession
of the shipment...

01:29:32.354 --> 01:29:35.770
...and distribute it throughout
the Confederate Army.

01:29:36.316 --> 01:29:37.775
As we speak...

01:29:38.068 --> 01:29:39.610
...they're preparing to launch...

01:29:39.819 --> 01:29:42.441
...a pre-emptive strike
against Washington...

01:29:42.989 --> 01:29:46.773
...forever tearing this country apart.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:53.248
Gentlemen, the Knights of Aragon...

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.619
...will soon be restored
to our former glory...

01:29:56.836 --> 01:30:01.130
...as we stand in shadow and watch
America destroy itself!

01:30:01.674 --> 01:30:02.754
I've heard enough.

01:30:04.302 --> 01:30:06.627
Brothers, you know
my spirit is with you.

01:30:06.846 --> 01:30:09.930
But we risk antagonizing
a sleeping giant if we fail.

01:30:11.726 --> 01:30:12.805
I'll see myself out.

01:30:22.779 --> 01:30:24.486
Lord Dillingham.

01:30:27.241 --> 01:30:30.776
Would a demonstration
put your mind at ease?

01:31:00.524 --> 01:31:02.813
Unless you come to confess...

01:31:03.027 --> 01:31:05.518
...you have no business here,
McGivens.

01:31:05.738 --> 01:31:08.359
Funny you should mention
confession, padre...

01:31:08.574 --> 01:31:11.694
...seeing that you're obliged to keep
the secrets of your flock.

01:31:13.912 --> 01:31:15.822
Joaquincito, go back inside!

01:31:21.336 --> 01:31:22.712
Who's Zorro?

01:31:23.797 --> 01:31:26.549
You know, Zorro could be
anyone at all.

01:31:27.843 --> 01:31:29.551
Come on, now.

01:31:30.262 --> 01:31:32.551
We're both men of God.

01:31:36.184 --> 01:31:37.844
You can tell me.

01:31:38.395 --> 01:31:39.391
Hey, boss.

01:31:51.116 --> 01:31:52.907
Lord hates a liar.

01:31:54.411 --> 01:31:56.736
All right, I'll tell you.

01:31:58.957 --> 01:32:00.368
Run!

01:32:14.472 --> 01:32:17.094
Felipe! You killed Felipe!

01:32:42.583 --> 01:32:44.078
Gentlemen...

01:32:44.711 --> 01:32:45.706
...the future.

01:33:18.619 --> 01:33:22.617
This facility will provide
a continuous supply of nitro...

01:33:23.082 --> 01:33:25.039
...to the Southern battlefront.

01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:27.208
I'll be returning to Europe shortly...

01:33:27.419 --> 01:33:30.954
...but Ferroq will remain
to oversee the operation.

01:33:32.341 --> 01:33:35.258
The nitro has been concealed
in these bottles...

01:33:35.469 --> 01:33:38.672
...to circumvent any prying
Northern patrol.

01:33:46.939 --> 01:33:50.936
An urgent matter requires
your attention at the hacienda.

01:33:56.949 --> 01:33:58.988
He's going back to the hacienda.

01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:02.784
- I have to get back before he does.
- I'll keep the train from leaving. Go.

01:34:02.996 --> 01:34:05.618
Elena. Be careful.

01:35:55.566 --> 01:35:56.562
Armand.

01:35:57.526 --> 01:36:02.402
My goodness, I must have dozed off
and your dogs startled me.

01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:06.314
Perhaps they thought
you were someone you're not.

01:36:08.412 --> 01:36:10.369
I'm told you arrived early.

01:36:10.706 --> 01:36:12.283
I could not wait.

01:36:12.499 --> 01:36:14.824
I'm having a special meal prepared.

01:36:15.419 --> 01:36:16.747
I hope you're hungry.

01:36:17.212 --> 01:36:19.169
I'm famished.

01:36:27.306 --> 01:36:28.930
Thank you, Marie.

01:36:32.728 --> 01:36:34.435
You are not hungry?

01:36:52.122 --> 01:36:53.746
Tasty, is it?

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.375
It's unusual.

01:36:57.419 --> 01:36:58.699
Is it quail?

01:37:00.588 --> 01:37:01.668
Pigeon.

01:37:31.285 --> 01:37:33.408
As you said, Elena...

01:37:34.247 --> 01:37:37.366
...we see the people we love
as we wish them to be...

01:37:37.583 --> 01:37:39.706
...not as who they really are.

01:37:46.092 --> 01:37:47.752
Did you actually think...

01:37:47.969 --> 01:37:51.551
...that I would be swept off my feet
by a sadistic coward like you?

01:37:52.932 --> 01:37:55.257
I thought you were
a woman of vision.

01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:59.807
"Vision." I could barely stomach
the sight of you, Armand.

01:38:00.022 --> 01:38:03.356
The only way I could bear your touch
was to imagine you were Alejandro.

01:38:06.403 --> 01:38:08.776
Your stepfather would be ashamed.

01:38:09.698 --> 01:38:12.699
You've become nothing more
than a common woman...

01:38:12.993 --> 01:38:15.401
...devoted to a common man.

01:38:16.121 --> 01:38:18.659
I take that as a compliment.

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.077
Mama!

01:38:22.086 --> 01:38:23.794
Oh, Joaquin!

01:38:25.839 --> 01:38:28.793
Padre's dead
and the kid's a witness.

01:38:58.955 --> 01:39:00.663
No, no, no.

01:39:02.167 --> 01:39:04.325
We'll need the next batch of it.

01:39:05.128 --> 01:39:06.872
Put some more here now.

01:39:08.006 --> 01:39:09.631
We'll rendezvous at Clanton's Pass.

01:39:09.841 --> 01:39:12.415
You and your men can
assume control of the train there.

01:39:38.703 --> 01:39:41.194
Zorro! Zorro!

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.329
No!

01:40:06.731 --> 01:40:07.845
If you please.

01:40:44.143 --> 01:40:45.222
Remove his mask.

01:40:56.739 --> 01:40:57.937
You.

01:41:27.477 --> 01:41:29.386
You've lost it all.

01:41:30.689 --> 01:41:32.313
Your wife.

01:41:33.358 --> 01:41:34.852
Your son.

01:41:36.194 --> 01:41:37.854
And for what?

01:41:41.866 --> 01:41:43.444
For this?

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.361
No matter where you go, Armand...

01:41:48.373 --> 01:41:49.997
...whatever you do...

01:41:50.792 --> 01:41:53.828
...the world isn't big enough
to hide from me.

01:42:10.395 --> 01:42:11.805
Goodbye, de la Vega.

01:42:13.481 --> 01:42:15.806
No! Armand, no!

01:42:19.987 --> 01:42:22.775
Please. Not in front of Joaquin.

01:42:28.955 --> 01:42:30.200
Please.

01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:45.962
As soon as we're gone.

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.555
Elena.

01:42:51.227 --> 01:42:53.765
My family is my life.

01:43:42.986 --> 01:43:45.275
Shame about your friend the padre.

01:43:45.489 --> 01:43:47.730
But he died with God's name
on his lips...

01:43:47.949 --> 01:43:49.776
...and a bullet in his heart.

01:43:49.993 --> 01:43:53.742
And now I send you out,
a sheep amongst wolves.

01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:36.556
Thank God...

01:45:37.224 --> 01:45:38.552
...you're alive.

01:45:38.934 --> 01:45:40.345
I already did.

01:45:45.941 --> 01:45:49.144
Listen, go to the marshal's office...

01:45:49.361 --> 01:45:51.934
...and tell them what Armand
is doing here.

01:45:52.364 --> 01:45:53.395
Where are you going?

01:45:54.491 --> 01:45:56.069
To catch a train.

01:46:16.721 --> 01:46:18.928
Can I get you something to drink?

01:46:19.349 --> 01:46:21.176
Understand something:

01:46:21.685 --> 01:46:24.176
You can lock me
in a tower forever...

01:46:24.604 --> 01:46:26.763
...and I will never stop hating you.

01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:30.436
You may feel differently when you see
how Joaquin enjoys...

01:46:30.652 --> 01:46:32.609
...the life of an aristocrat.

01:46:32.821 --> 01:46:35.359
- I can't wait till my papi kicks your...
- Joaquin!

01:46:46.167 --> 01:46:48.789
Zorro! Zorro, Zorro!

01:46:52.882 --> 01:46:53.878
Don't touch him!

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.535
Guards!

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:42.072
Come on!

01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:56.416
Yes!

01:49:34.959 --> 01:49:37.165
Good boy. Well done.

01:50:02.653 --> 01:50:05.405
Let's see how much
your father truly loves you.

01:50:17.543 --> 01:50:18.788
Get the boy!

01:50:34.226 --> 01:50:36.135
Joaquin, quick.

01:50:40.941 --> 01:50:42.815
- Keep going.
- What are you doing?

01:50:43.026 --> 01:50:45.980
When the car stops, get off
and follow the tracks back to town.

01:50:46.238 --> 01:50:48.195
You are the son of Zorro.
You can do it.

01:50:48.407 --> 01:50:49.817
Now, go.

01:50:57.082 --> 01:50:58.457
How did you get in here?

01:52:37.473 --> 01:52:39.300
So the devil will know who sent you.

01:53:59.262 --> 01:54:00.887
The drinks are on me.

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.832
My fellow Californians...

01:54:33.296 --> 01:54:36.961
...we have gathered here
at historic Bear Point...

01:54:37.174 --> 01:54:42.465
...to make official our entrance into
the United States of America!

01:54:43.472 --> 01:54:45.050
Bravo!

01:59:07.650 --> 01:59:09.726
Welcome to the Union, governor.

02:00:01.328 --> 02:00:04.329
Look at you.
A real heartbreaker, huh?

02:00:06.166 --> 02:00:07.661
- Dad?
- Yeah?

02:00:07.876 --> 02:00:10.546
Why didn't you tell me
who you are?

02:00:12.631 --> 02:00:14.090
Come here.

02:00:17.761 --> 02:00:19.006
Joaquin...

02:00:21.056 --> 02:00:25.765
...when you were born, I vowed
I would give my life to keep you safe.

02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:30.230
I thought I could protect you
by hiding the truth.

02:00:33.902 --> 02:00:35.562
But your mother was right.

02:00:35.779 --> 02:00:40.026
It wasn't my secret to keep.
It belongs to all of us.

02:00:41.743 --> 02:00:45.242
So I promise I will never
lie to you again. Never.

02:01:03.181 --> 02:01:08.341
I bless these rings in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:16.682
Elena...

02:01:17.445 --> 02:01:21.657
...receive this ring as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:27.151
Alejandro...

02:01:28.122 --> 02:01:33.330
...receive this ring as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

02:01:40.802 --> 02:01:45.262
Today you join in the fullness of time
for all eternity.

02:01:45.473 --> 02:01:49.091
Yea, seeketh tolerance
when easily provoked.

02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:53.355
Love endureth,
for it keeps no score of wrongs.

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:57.687
Love bears all things
and believes all things.

02:01:58.069 --> 02:02:00.690
Love endures day by day...

02:02:01.113 --> 02:02:02.607
...hour by hour...

02:02:02.823 --> 02:02:04.448
...minute by minute.
- Padre.

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:06.658
Love is patient...

02:02:06.869 --> 02:02:08.114
Padre.

02:02:08.662 --> 02:02:11.367
Can you hurry it up a little?
The people are calling.

02:02:16.337 --> 02:02:18.045
It's who we are.

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:21.541
- Do you want her back?
- Of course I do.

02:02:21.759 --> 02:02:24.428
- And you take him?
- If I must.

02:02:28.724 --> 02:02:31.844
You may now kiss the bride. Again.

02:02:38.525 --> 02:02:40.067
Don't wait up.

02:02:40.277 --> 02:02:41.557
Never.
