WEBVTT

00:12.112 --> 00:14.781
(beeping)

00:14.848 --> 00:17.450
RUXIN: (inhales)

00:17.518 --> 00:18.719
RAFFI: Hey.

00:18.785 --> 00:19.720
(muffled yell)

00:19.786 --> 00:21.922
Shh.

00:21.988 --> 00:24.558
Come on, don't fight it.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.659
Don't fight it.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.093
Come on.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.294
What's happening?

00:28.361 --> 00:30.531
You had a stroke, okay?

00:30.597 --> 00:32.899
So it's time to die.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.868
Great news‐‐ your dick still
works.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.336
What?

00:36.402 --> 00:39.405
I harvested a bunch of your
sperm, so you're going to live
forever.

00:39.472 --> 00:40.240
How?

00:40.306 --> 00:42.108
How? I jerked you off like
a dog.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.877
You're the Angel of Death.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.812
No, I'm the angel of murder.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.447
I don't want to die...

00:47.514 --> 00:49.282
Oh, my God.

00:49.349 --> 00:50.617
Hey, man, stop hitting me!

00:50.684 --> 00:51.284
I'm trying to kill you!

00:51.351 --> 00:52.819
What was that, that I felt?

00:52.886 --> 00:53.787
It was a murder boner.

00:53.854 --> 00:54.755
What do you think it is?

00:54.821 --> 00:56.790
Sir, visiting is ten minutes
on the hour.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.158
He's trying to kill me.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.893
(laughing): This guy's
hilarious.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.127
You'll have to go to
the lounge.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.896
Okay. Wait‐‐

01:02.963 --> 01:04.798
Just so I'm clear, this isn't
going to turn into some, like,
crazy three‐way action?

01:04.865 --> 01:05.198
Lobby.

01:05.265 --> 01:05.999
All right.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.133
He's my El CuÃ±ado.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.168
He's the Devil.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.169
All right, time to die.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.003
What, you're still here?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.004
Sir.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.338
Oh, God.

01:17.443 --> 01:18.912
ANDRE: It's good news and
bad news.

01:18.979 --> 01:19.746
He definitely had a stroke.

01:19.813 --> 01:20.647
KEVIN: Really.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.549
He has limited mobility in
his limbs.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.451
And it looks good, but he's not
out of the woods yet.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.920
Did you get a chance to
see him?

01:26.987 --> 01:27.921
No.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.690
ICU's for family only, so I just
wanted...

01:29.756 --> 01:30.524
Yeah, but you're a doctor.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.825
‐ Just...
‐ I mean, I could...

01:31.892 --> 01:32.659
TACO: Just go back there.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.827
We need to know.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.095
I don't need to go back
there, flaunt my doctoring.

01:35.161 --> 01:36.997
PETE: Andre, they won't let
you go back there, will they?

01:37.063 --> 01:38.231
'Cause you're not a real doctor.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.534
I'm respecting the family's
privacy right now.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.437
JENNY: Guys, there are issues
we all need to discuss.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.107
Ruxin has affairs that need to
be tended to.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.475
You know, he's in the ICU.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.312
He's also in the Sacko
this week.

01:52.378 --> 01:54.280
What are we going to do about
his team?

01:54.347 --> 01:55.982
You know, I was closest with
Ruxin, I think.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.084
And so I feel like I could
manage his team for the week.

01:58.151 --> 01:58.919
I'd be impartial...

01:58.985 --> 01:59.586
No way.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.120
No, no.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.555
Not a chance.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.958
My opinion is the only fair
way to do it is "team by
committee."

02:05.025 --> 02:06.660
You know what, he's been
through a lot.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.261
We should just give him the
Shiva.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.195
You shut your goddamn mouth!

02:09.262 --> 02:11.064
You pulled that out of your
ass, Taco.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.233
It was a mild stroke.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.001
Mild, okay?

02:15.068 --> 02:17.003
If he had cancer, we'd talk
about it.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.438
I don't know, guys.

02:18.505 --> 02:21.508
Having a near death experience
has changed the way I see
things.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.744
Ruxin had the stroke, not
you, Taco.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.811
I was right next to him.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.446
I was near death.

02:26.513 --> 02:27.581
Oh, God.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.716
And it's made me realize
what's important in life.

02:29.783 --> 02:30.684
What is that?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.953
It's not in this room, that's
for sure.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.989
It's out there somewhere.

02:36.056 --> 02:36.757
Hey, Raffi.

02:36.823 --> 02:37.924
How's he doing?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.060
Brian, I'm not going to lie
to you‐‐ it's not good.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.763
He wouldn't even let me
kill him.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.166
SOFIA: Ruxin had his company
do his will, and I found
something for you guys.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.235
He left a will for his fantasy
team.

02:49.302 --> 02:52.138
And I hope that you will abide
by his wishes.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.174
There we go.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.442
Hello, I'm Rodney Ruxin.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.644
Everyone calls me Ruxin.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.846
And this is my last will and
testament.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.549
First of all, congratulations
for knowing me.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.118
You really knocked it out of the
park, friend‐wise.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.789
But now I have moved on‐‐ left
this world for a better place.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.523
Is it hot there?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.456
Shh.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.193
My prize golf clubs I leave
to Pete.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.028
No, Kevin... Wha... Andre...

03:15.095 --> 03:15.962
Me?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.631
No... Pete... No, Kev...

03:17.698 --> 03:20.000
You know what, no, throw 'em
away.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.101
What?

03:21.167 --> 03:22.503
Nope, sell them on Craig's
List.

03:22.569 --> 03:23.970
No, you know what, throw them
away.

03:24.037 --> 03:24.705
It's classic.

03:24.771 --> 03:25.772
He even tinkers with his will.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.306
Craig's List.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.809
Craig's List.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.911
A few things to clear up.

03:30.977 --> 03:34.147
Pete, your Paul's Boutique
vinyl‐‐ I took it.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.916
What?!

03:35.982 --> 03:38.652
I listened to it, I scratched
it, I threw it away and blamed
it on the lacrosse team.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.820
Son of a bitch.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.721
Sorry.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.656
To Jenny‐‐ honestly, I don't
get it.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.525
I don't see what Kevin sees
in you.

03:44.591 --> 03:45.992
I don't get you guys; never did.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.493
100% agree.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.262
Yeah.

03:49.329 --> 03:54.968
Now, if I die or am
incapacitated during the regular
season, I bequeath my team to...

03:55.035 --> 03:56.703
Andre.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.671
What?

03:57.738 --> 03:58.438
He picked me.

03:58.505 --> 03:59.405
Out of all of you, he picked me.

03:59.472 --> 04:00.306
This is great. I mean...

04:00.373 --> 04:02.709
Andre, the shit just got
really real.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.577
Okay.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.645
And you better not (bleep)

04:04.711 --> 04:05.378
this up.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.346
No pressure, buddy.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.348
This has been my last will
and testament.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.716
I mean, whatever, I'm dead now.

04:09.783 --> 04:13.820
So I just want to wish you one
last hearty and heartfelt‐‐

04:13.887 --> 04:17.257
Suck it!

04:17.323 --> 04:18.692
You must miss him so much.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.695
You ready for this weekend,
huh?

04:21.762 --> 04:22.362
I'm very ready.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.363
I'm taking you down, buddy.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.164
Shiva Bowl! Come on!

04:24.230 --> 04:25.866
Oh, man, it's going to be
fun.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.368
If you win, I'm going to be so
happy for you.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.636
No, Taco, no.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.471
You're supposed to talk shit
to me.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.973
I'm not going to talk shit
to you.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.074
You're my brother.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.241
You've never won the Shiva.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.543
I've won the Shiva.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.444
Come on, man, you're taking
all the fun out of this for me.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.212
This is important to me.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.380
I know.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.348
I have so many other good things
going on in my life.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.483
This is all you have.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.818
This is just pathetic.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.853
This is the worst Shiva Bowl
ever.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.154
Kevin versus Taco.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.189
Just nothing there.

04:49.255 --> 04:50.223
This is no fun.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.992
Oh, hello.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.326
Vodka martini.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.628
Splash of Tabasco.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.730
What are you shit sippers
talking about?

04:56.797 --> 04:57.631
What is this?

04:57.698 --> 04:58.832
Are you trying to be Ruxin?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.133
What are you doing?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.035
Maybe you guys can talk about
it when you're having sex with

05:02.102 --> 05:04.605
each other in the private hotel
room that I bought you.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.807
Why do you think he would
buy us a hotel room?

05:06.873 --> 05:08.609
Isn't that something
that Ruxin would do?

05:08.675 --> 05:09.442
Like, buy a hotel room?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.711
To watch us have sex?

05:10.777 --> 05:13.346
You would pay to see two guys
having sex?

05:13.413 --> 05:14.280
I don't know.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.916
This is hard to do as Ruxin.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.553
Andre, look, the Sacko Bowl
doesn't need any extra lore this
year, all right?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.354
Look what we've got going on.

05:21.421 --> 05:26.259
In one corner, the Sacko del
Toro commissioner who could
possibly bring home the Sacko.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.262
And in the other corner, who
could go from first to worst,

05:29.329 --> 05:32.032
courtesy of this frittata
traffic hump.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.901
Hey, which one of you dumb
dildoes is running Ruxin's team?

05:34.968 --> 05:36.302
That would be Andre.

05:36.369 --> 05:38.038
Okay, I've got a bone to pick
with you.

05:38.104 --> 05:38.772
I'm next of kin.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.506
I'm family.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.440
Okay, okay, we need to go.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.175
Hey, I'll talk to you later,
tall guy.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.043
No reason to yell.

05:43.109 --> 05:43.877
There's a will.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.311
And he bequeathed his team
to me.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.146
That's what it said?

05:46.212 --> 05:47.280
Yeah.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.481
Change of plans‐‐ we're
running the team together.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.850
We're not running the team
together.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.618
We're running the team
together.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.218
Uh‐oh.

05:52.285 --> 05:52.986
Got to go, guys.

05:53.053 --> 05:53.720
Happy holidays.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.655
Later, guys. Good to see you.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.089
Put down the knife
for a second?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.123
No. You know what, here.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.892
Oh, all right.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.093
Great. Push the button.

06:00.160 --> 06:00.894
Boom.

06:00.961 --> 06:01.728
No.

06:01.795 --> 06:02.829
Now we're having a
conversation.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.631
What do I need a knife to run
a team?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.099
To settle lineup disputes.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.167
We do that with our words.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.902
No. Words are bullshit.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.005
They're just useless sounds that
we make with our stupid mouths.

06:12.072 --> 06:12.706
Okay...

06:12.773 --> 06:13.940
This is how stuff gets done.

06:14.007 --> 06:14.541
Here you go.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.341
Take back your knife.

06:15.408 --> 06:16.342
Huge mistake.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.712
Now I have four deadly weapons
on my body.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.613
Four?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.382
Yeah. Two knives, my dick and
this.

06:22.448 --> 06:23.784
You're not allowed to carry
a gun.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.152
I am allowed to carry a gun
if I don't tell anybody I
have it.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.087
It's called a concealed weapon.

06:27.153 --> 06:27.821
Merry Christmas.

06:27.888 --> 06:28.589
Oh my God, thank you so much.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.823
Merry Christmas to you.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.025
Later, Andre.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.331
ANDRE: Hello. Hey.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.733
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.701
You're still not allowed...

06:40.767 --> 06:42.102
That's all right, he's
with me.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.870
That's that sexy nurse I was
telling you about.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.471
How's he doing?

06:45.539 --> 06:49.075
Well, he had a rough night,
but he's been mildly sedated, so
he's resting.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.176
Uh‐oh. Chemistry.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.277
Bing‐bang‐boom.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.647
Um, it's up to me to set
his lineup.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.281
I'm managing his team.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.650
We're co‐managing the
team, really.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.618
We're not co‐managing.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.452
You know nothing about fantasy
football.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.287
Sure I do.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.123
I just don't understand why you
won't let me draft the players I
want to play.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.157
It's fantasy football.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.626
So the Hulk should be able to be
on the team.

07:05.692 --> 07:09.129
Now, look, Ruxin, do you want
me to put Ryan Torain in
your lineup?

07:09.195 --> 07:11.297
Blink once if that's a yes.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.499
Was that a blink?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.068
Hope that's a blink.

07:15.135 --> 07:22.142
If you screw up my team, I'll
cut your penis into thin slices
of salami.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.513
He says he loves me.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.948
No, he didn't.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.584
He said he's going to cut your
penis into small slices
of salami.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.417
We both heard that, right?

07:31.484 --> 07:32.352
You heard that?

07:32.418 --> 07:33.053
He didn't say that.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.120
This has been a good visit.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.088
It has been.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.523
Ooh, a little shoulder touch
there, huh?

07:36.590 --> 07:39.492
Normally, I'd be all over you
like crazy times.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.294
You know what I like about you?

07:41.361 --> 07:42.763
You're making me work for it.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.866
Taco got us a Christmas
present.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.068
I cannot do homemade
deodorant any...

07:48.134 --> 07:51.471
No, no, no, this one we can
actually use.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.539
Really?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.007
Yeah, check that out.

07:54.074 --> 07:54.941
Oh!

07:55.008 --> 07:56.142
Yeah!

07:56.209 --> 07:57.443
A VHS.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.980
A VHS or DVD, I'm not...

08:00.046 --> 08:01.181
still not sure.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.048
I still don't remember.

08:02.115 --> 08:02.916
It's a big‐ass joint.

08:02.983 --> 08:03.383
Well...

08:03.449 --> 08:04.150
Right now?

08:04.217 --> 08:04.851
Let's fire it up.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.053
It's the holidays, baby. Yeah!

08:07.120 --> 08:08.354
Oh, man.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.956
Oh, man, is right.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.324
Merry Christmas.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.526
Happy Kwanzaa.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.027
Love this.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.962
Look at...

08:16.029 --> 08:18.665
this...

08:18.732 --> 08:21.702
You're feeling very fertile.

08:21.768 --> 08:25.405
Are you trying to
"hye‐na‐tize" me right now?

08:25.471 --> 08:26.640
What? No.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.009
We have a bet, babe. I'm just...

08:29.075 --> 08:29.943
What if I lose?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.678
There are no shortcuts in
fatherhood.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.479
There are no shortcuts to the
Shiva.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.881
Just win, baby.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.018
Ew. Feels like I'm kissing Al
Davis.

08:38.084 --> 08:39.319
No.

08:39.385 --> 08:43.657
But you're still extremely
fertile.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.925
I'm super fertile.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.828
And you love to be mounted
and humped.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.095
I do.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.463
What?

08:50.531 --> 08:52.966
I'm so tired.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.241
(snapping gum)

09:01.307 --> 09:03.176
May I help you?

09:03.243 --> 09:04.444
I'm here to see my husband.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.378
And he is?

09:05.445 --> 09:06.513
Rodney Ruxin.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.581
I'm Sofia Ruxin.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.049
No, you're not.

09:09.115 --> 09:09.916
Yes, I am.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.552
I met Mrs. Sofia Ruxin
earlier today.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.786
No, that's not possible.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.487
Tell me about the woman that
you saw.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.355
Brown hair...

09:15.421 --> 09:16.089
Low‐cut top?

09:16.156 --> 09:16.690
Yes.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.457
Bit of a label whore?

09:17.524 --> 09:18.291
Yes.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.159
Painted‐on jeans?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.126
Oh, definitely.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.995
Inappropriately high heels
for daytime?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.096
I'd say so.

09:23.163 --> 09:27.233
That Puerto Rican slut is my
husband's mistress.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.702
No.

09:28.769 --> 09:34.107
You let my husband's mistress
in to see him before I got
in there!

09:34.174 --> 09:35.008
I am so sorry.

09:35.075 --> 09:35.876
You should be.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.544
I'm going to buzz you in
right now.

09:37.611 --> 09:38.979
Gracias.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.281
(lock buzzing)

09:46.452 --> 09:47.521
Hey.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.023
Hey, how you doing?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.825
What happened?

09:51.892 --> 09:54.928
The last thing I remember, I'd
won the Shiva again this year.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.731
No, you didn't win the Shiva
this year.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.000
What pick did I get in the
draft again?

10:00.066 --> 10:01.334
Fifth.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.169
Liar.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.505
There you are.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.640
I've been here the whole
time.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.174
Why are you dressed like
a whore?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.076
I had to dress like your wife
to get in here.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.745
Fives.

10:11.812 --> 10:15.148
Look, I don't know if Kevin
is going to win.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.383
I don't know if you're going
to live.

10:17.450 --> 10:22.422
All I know is that Kevin is so
damn close to winning the Shiva
Bowl.

10:22.488 --> 10:25.191
You have got to make this season
count, do you hear me?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.093
Jenny.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.394
Yeah.

10:28.461 --> 10:33.299
I will continue this season
so that Pete can get the Sacko.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.735
Yes, Ruxin.

10:34.801 --> 10:39.105
Look, if I get the Sacko, the
season doesn't count.

10:39.172 --> 10:43.076
And then he said if he gets
the Sacko, the whole season
doesn't count.

10:43.143 --> 10:43.877
It's up to you.

10:43.944 --> 10:44.745
No.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.946
You have to take one for
the team.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.214
You have to get the Sacko and
let Ruxin win.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.150
No. I've already done my
Saint Peter duties.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.853
If the season doesn't count,
I don't get the Shiva.

10:52.919 --> 10:56.222
This is the most important thing
that's ever happened to me in my
life.

10:56.289 --> 10:56.690
No offense.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.158
None taken.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.393
Come on, how would you feel
if you Shiva championship didn't
count?

11:00.460 --> 11:01.061
Well, which one?

11:01.127 --> 11:01.895
There's been quite a few.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.363
You son of a bitch.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.599
This is Kevin's only chance
in the Shiva Bowl.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.933
He has never been here before.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.603
He will probably never be here
again.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.236
No offense.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.237
None taken.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.172
Do it!

11:12.238 --> 11:13.874
Hey, listen to me.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.343
As we all know, I was not the
most gentle and considerate of
Sacko commissioners.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.444
You were the worst.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.780
I'd be like a cop going to
jail.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.114
Very vulnerable.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.316
Why is it a foregone
conclusion that Ruxin's going to
lose?

11:23.383 --> 11:26.186
Need I remind you that I am in
charge of his team.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.320
Oh, dear God, Andre.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.488
Exactly.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.156
Granted, I've had some
trouble this week with Raffi.

11:30.223 --> 11:34.861
Which reminds me, I need you to
create a fictional player called
Bruce Banner.

11:34.928 --> 11:35.962
The Incredible Hulk?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.664
Yeah.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.766
He wants him on the team, and he
said if we don't get him, he's
going to stab me.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.668
Hi, guys.

11:41.735 --> 11:46.172
Look, ever since I came face to
Ruxin's face with death, I've
been doing a lot of thinking.

11:46.239 --> 11:50.476
I've been spending so much time
in the rat race that I've lost
touch with what's important.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.878
What rat race are you in?

11:51.945 --> 11:54.114
He races rats in the alley
behind his apartment.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.817
All this time spent punching
the clocks, making bank.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.051
For what, huh?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.953
Well, you could start by
buying me a Bud Light and paying

12:00.020 --> 12:03.624
me back for the years of
mooching, eating my food,
sleeping at my house.

12:03.690 --> 12:07.761
Oh, Kevin, I realize that
this money can actually do some
good.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.431
That's why I gave it away to
Matt Forte's charity, Mercy Home
for Boys and Girls.

12:11.497 --> 12:12.298
You did?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.167
Matt Forte‐‐ he's on Ruxin's
team.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.736
I know.

12:15.802 --> 12:18.204
I figured a visit from Ruxin's
favorite player would make him
very happy.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.106
No. No, this whole charity
bullshit is collusion.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.175
Donating to children at the
holidays‐‐ collusion?

12:22.242 --> 12:22.609
Yeah, come on.

12:22.676 --> 12:23.409
Approved.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.310
Seconded.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.646
What the hell kind of league
is this?

12:25.712 --> 12:27.681
You just say approved, and
then all of a sudden it's done?

12:27.748 --> 12:28.982
Yes. Eight man missionary
league.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.785
Your turn to take it.

12:37.290 --> 12:41.094
MATT FORTE: Thanks again,
man, for that donation to Mercy
Home.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.162
Kids are going to enjoy it.

12:42.228 --> 12:43.496
Oh, no problem.

12:43.564 --> 12:45.265
And if you want, I could send
them a case of Three Penis wine.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.933
I think they'll be all right
without that.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.368
Well, well, well.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.336
Mr. Matt Forte.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.605
Dr. Andre Nowzick.

12:51.672 --> 12:52.405
How are you?

12:52.472 --> 12:53.173
I'm fine.

12:53.239 --> 12:53.840
Knees good?

12:53.907 --> 12:54.841
I'm good.

12:54.908 --> 12:55.341
You're fine?

12:55.408 --> 12:56.376
Don't touch him.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.410
I can touch him.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.579
He's on the fantasy team.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.413
You shouldn't be touching
anybody looking like that.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.982
(laughing): Oh, burn.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.651
Oh, here he is.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.152
Poor son of a bitch.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.354
Sure you're not walking with
a limp, right?

13:08.421 --> 13:09.322
I'm good, man.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.758
Thank you so much for this
jersey.

13:11.825 --> 13:12.793
It's great.

13:12.859 --> 13:13.594
No problem.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.995
We're going to bury him
in it.

13:15.061 --> 13:15.929
He's not dead, Taco.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.297
He will be soon.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.132
(shouting): Ruxin!

13:19.199 --> 13:21.502
I brought you a special visitor!

13:21.568 --> 13:22.435
Look.

13:22.503 --> 13:25.338
My God, it's Matt Forte!

13:25.405 --> 13:26.507
How you doing, man?

13:26.573 --> 13:28.742
Deliverance here is going to
play the banjo for you.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.711
Classic Forte burn.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.179
When you get better, you're
coming to a game as my guest.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.681
Even got this signed football
for you.

13:34.748 --> 13:37.417
Cool.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.484
(groans)

13:38.552 --> 13:39.620
Feel better, buddy.

13:39.686 --> 13:40.587
Take good care of that, bro.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.422
Bring it in, boys.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.624
Ruxin on three.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.960
One, two, three, Ruxin.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.929
‐ Yeah.
‐ Great job.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.464
(bleep) you guys.

13:51.532 --> 13:53.767
The holidays is a time for
giving, Pete.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.535
Just give it up.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.702
I'm not going to win the Sacko.

13:55.769 --> 13:56.269
Come on.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.170
It's not happening.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.404
Get over it.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.140
Hey, Vincent Van Slow, what
are you drawing over there?

14:00.206 --> 14:01.474
Ta‐da.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.676
That's a funeral.

14:02.743 --> 14:03.810
Yep.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.046
All right, you know that
Ruxin's not going to die.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.515
He won the battle, not the
war.

14:08.582 --> 14:09.750
Ho, ho, ho.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.084
Merry Sackmas.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.119
Oh, it's Sacko Claus.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.756
That's right‐‐ everything in
that box represents the torture

14:15.822 --> 14:18.424
that I went through having the
Sacko.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.763
The trophy, the outfits and of
course, the Sacko steak brands.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.064
Steak brands?

14:24.130 --> 14:25.699
Oh, you didn't hear about
Sacko steak night?

14:25.766 --> 14:26.733
No.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.068
Pete would come over to my
house once a week.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.302
I'd have to make him steak.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.370
Filet.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.740
And then I'd have to brand it
with the Shiva.

14:33.807 --> 14:38.311
And then brand my steak‐‐ a
lesser grade of course‐‐ with
the Sacko.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.913
Of course, you are what you
you eat.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.783
Well, you'll be eating a lot
of Sacko meat next year,
my friend.

14:42.849 --> 14:43.684
I don't want that shit.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.551
Get it away from me.

14:44.618 --> 14:45.819
No, it's not mine anymore.

14:45.886 --> 14:46.853
Ooh! I'll take it.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.221
This stuff is perfect.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.723
You can hold on to it, Taco.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.058
Like Sacko escrow.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.026
What's up? Boom.

14:53.093 --> 14:53.994
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:54.060 --> 14:54.828
Move it! Scoot, scoot!

14:54.895 --> 14:55.996
What are you doing here?

14:56.062 --> 14:56.963
Excuse me, excuse me.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.264
I came to talk to my buddy.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.866
How do you know where I live?

14:59.933 --> 15:03.036
Hey, do you still have those
butt plugs with Bert and Ernie's
face on them?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.338
Those were my daughter's
tubby toys.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.840
She should not play with
those.

15:06.907 --> 15:07.641
Those should be burned.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.275
Please don't come here
anymore.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.577
I have team business for you.

15:10.644 --> 15:11.945
So, uh... Let's go.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.647
No, I don't want a knife.

15:13.714 --> 15:14.515
Excuse me, sir.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.415
Huge mistake.

15:15.481 --> 15:16.249
What's up?

15:16.316 --> 15:16.983
Yeah, okay.

15:17.050 --> 15:17.818
Knives back in your pocket.

15:17.884 --> 15:18.885
No knives in my house.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.587
Fine.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.756
By the way, I wanted to talk
to you‐‐ you can't just add/drop
players willy‐nilly.

15:22.823 --> 15:24.357
You have to talk to me
about that.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.426
No, that's what you're doing,
and it's pissing me off.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.360
You got to cut it out.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.895
Mario Manningham‐‐ you picked
him up.

15:28.962 --> 15:29.730
No, you picked him up!

15:29.796 --> 15:30.496
Who is that?

15:30.564 --> 15:31.732
Is he from <i>Super Mario Bros.?</i>

15:31.798 --> 15:33.399
Because, if it was on me, I
would have picked up Luigi.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.069
Look, if you're not picking
him up and I didn't pick him up,
who picked him up?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.705
(Ruxin grunting)

15:38.772 --> 15:41.542
(slurred mumbling)

15:41.608 --> 15:44.745
I hate my team.

15:44.811 --> 15:48.715
No, no, I got to pick up...

15:48.782 --> 15:51.284
Oh, shit.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.319
Nurse!

15:53.386 --> 15:58.024
I need to pick up a wide
receiver!

16:03.163 --> 16:05.498
Now, you are his wife?

16:05.566 --> 16:06.633
Yeah.

16:06.700 --> 16:07.668
Oh, okay.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.669
Okay, how's he doing?

16:08.735 --> 16:09.636
Is he getting better?

16:09.703 --> 16:10.704
What's happening?

16:10.771 --> 16:12.539
His motor skills are
improving.

16:12.606 --> 16:13.540
That's the good news.

16:13.607 --> 16:14.407
That's really good.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.342
When is he going to be able
to walk?

16:16.409 --> 16:17.544
It's just too early to say.

16:17.611 --> 16:19.345
You have to be patient.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.614
Oh.

16:20.681 --> 16:22.916
Hey!

16:22.983 --> 16:23.917
Hi, babe.

16:23.984 --> 16:24.985
Hi, baby.

16:25.051 --> 16:25.986
You're going to walk soon.

16:26.052 --> 16:26.953
I'm never gonna walk.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.354
You want to try?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.355
No.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.123
Come on!

16:30.190 --> 16:31.157
Move your legs.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.895
Best thing for her is Botox
in the bladder.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.397
It's a new thing, but we can
freeze that puppy right up.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.398
Yeah.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.399
Come on, baby.

16:39.465 --> 16:40.266
You can do it.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.668
Rodney?

16:41.735 --> 16:45.772
Shiva?

16:45.839 --> 16:48.942
(sultry whisper): Ruxin.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.077
I'm yours.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.847
I'm still yours.

16:53.914 --> 16:56.683
I'm the Shiva.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.726
(Ruxin grunting)

17:05.792 --> 17:08.394
There you go, babe.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.096
Good!

17:10.163 --> 17:11.832
Oh, my God.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.567
Oh, honey, that's so good.

17:13.634 --> 17:14.935
Yes!

17:15.001 --> 17:18.004
Yes, honey, yes, yes, yes!

17:18.071 --> 17:19.105
Honey, honey?

17:19.172 --> 17:20.006
I'm right here.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.074
You're still mine.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.743
You're still mine.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.978
(muffled mumbling)

17:25.045 --> 17:27.047
I am so sorry.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.649
I think he thinks you're me.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.884
Oh, no, this is the Shiva.

17:30.951 --> 17:32.485
Just Shiva.

17:32.553 --> 17:33.587
You're better!

17:33.654 --> 17:34.855
Yeah, doing great.

17:34.921 --> 17:35.856
How are you?

17:35.922 --> 17:37.658
I'm... I'm g... I'm good.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.593
(muffled chuckling)

17:39.660 --> 17:41.695
So how's Andre?

17:41.762 --> 17:43.930
Andre?

17:43.997 --> 17:44.898
(whispering): Andre.

17:44.965 --> 17:48.702
Oh, no, that human kumquat's got
my team.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.708
Holy shit, Kevin!

17:54.775 --> 17:56.877
You just won the Shiva Bowl!

17:56.943 --> 17:57.978
Did I?

17:58.044 --> 17:58.879
Really?

17:58.945 --> 18:00.046
Yes!

18:00.113 --> 18:01.114
Hey, where is Taco?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.049
I'm playing against a guy who
isn't even here.

18:03.116 --> 18:03.917
I mean, I invited him over.

18:03.984 --> 18:05.786
He said he had better things
to do.

18:05.852 --> 18:06.920
Look, you won the bet.

18:06.987 --> 18:08.321
Huh?

18:08.388 --> 18:09.623
You are the champion.

18:09.690 --> 18:10.624
Am I?

18:10.691 --> 18:11.525
Yes.

18:11.592 --> 18:13.694
The season doesn't even
count.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.661
I mean, Ruxin won the Sacko.

18:14.728 --> 18:15.696
Hallelujah!

18:15.762 --> 18:18.498
Saint Pete is not the Sacko!

18:18.565 --> 18:22.135
Mr. Ruxin will be having a
rough year ahead of him.

18:22.202 --> 18:25.706
Honestly, Ruxin should get a
special medical dispensation,
which means...

18:25.772 --> 18:27.440
He had a stroke.

18:27.508 --> 18:29.209
Yeah, I think you should be
the sole owner of the fetid bull
scrotum for next year.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.210
Congratulations, Andre.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.244
No, no, no, no, no.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.345
I do not get the Sacko.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.780
This is not fair at all.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.181
Ruxin asked me...

18:35.248 --> 18:37.150
Wait a second.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.852
This is a setup.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.186
Ruxin having the stroke.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.454
The video will.

18:41.522 --> 18:42.923
Oh, it just came out of nowhere.

18:42.989 --> 18:46.226
This whole thing has been an
elaborate setup just to get me

18:46.292 --> 18:48.161
to have the Sacko two years in
a row.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.062
Well, guess what.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.697
The gig is up.

18:50.764 --> 18:52.232
I think it's a jig.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.468
No, it's a gig because you
go... you play a gig, and when
the gig is...

18:55.536 --> 18:56.937
But the jig is the dance.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.506
No, but the gig is‐‐ when you
finish rockin' out, your gig
is over.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.642
That's not where it comes
from.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.442
Okay, you know what?

19:02.509 --> 19:03.476
I don't care what is up.

19:03.544 --> 19:04.911
I'm not going down like this.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.713
I'm not going down!

19:06.780 --> 19:11.084
All right, but as the Sacko
commissioner, I think I'm just
going to have to say that...

19:11.151 --> 19:12.519
it is decided.

19:12.586 --> 19:13.520
Mm‐hmm.

19:13.587 --> 19:14.688
Oh, no.

19:14.755 --> 19:15.689
It's an honor.

19:15.756 --> 19:16.690
It's a Dre‐peat.

19:16.757 --> 19:17.558
Hey, guys?

19:17.624 --> 19:20.226
We just got invited to a
funeral.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.294
Oh, shit.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.596
Is Ruxin dead?

19:22.663 --> 19:23.830
No, it's worse.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.599
He has a boat?

19:25.666 --> 19:28.434
Where did this platypus get
a boat?

19:28.502 --> 19:29.269
(grunts)

19:29.335 --> 19:30.303
What is this?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.204
What is going on, man?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.273
I didn't think you guys
would come.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.307
You didn't RSVP.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.275
Where did you get the boat?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.276
Over there.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.310
I broke the chain.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.278
What is all this stuff?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.312
It's everything!

19:39.379 --> 19:40.213
The Sacko, the Shiva?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.215
Yeah, it's a funeral for
the league.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.584
We need to destroy this season.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.785
The Shiva?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.019
The... the cobra box?

19:46.086 --> 19:47.353
Kegel the Elf?

19:47.420 --> 19:49.656
He has nothing to do with any
of this!

19:49.723 --> 19:50.757
Whoa.

19:50.824 --> 19:51.625
That's my computer, man.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.459
Yeah, this is what we
drafted on.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.295
This is where the evil all
began.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.362
Oh, come on.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.099
I don't like what I saw in
you guys this year.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.767
This whole league is tarnished.

20:00.834 --> 20:05.105
We need to burn it, bury it and
start clean, just like Pete did
with his wife.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.873
Taco, I didn't murder her.

20:06.940 --> 20:07.974
We got a divorce.

20:08.041 --> 20:08.775
Weak alibi.

20:08.842 --> 20:10.110
Sacko steak, anyone?

20:10.176 --> 20:11.177
No!

20:11.244 --> 20:13.146
I got the meat from the
supplier of Yobogoya.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.147
No, I'm good.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.148
Thank you.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.149
Yobogoya!

20:16.216 --> 20:17.150
(sizzling)

20:17.217 --> 20:18.118
(horn honking)

20:18.184 --> 20:19.152
Whoa!

20:19.219 --> 20:20.153
Bobbum Van.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.154
Bobbum Man!

20:21.221 --> 20:23.156
He's going to mess with my
equipmunk again?

20:23.223 --> 20:24.124
What's up, chicks?

20:24.190 --> 20:25.158
Whoa.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.159
Let's do this.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.193
Viking funeral.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.261
We're going to burn him.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.363
We're going to chop him up if we
need to, guys.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.832
Call trophies if you want them.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.600
I've got one of his ears.

20:33.667 --> 20:34.801
(grunts)

20:34.868 --> 20:35.869
Who is that?

20:35.936 --> 20:37.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:37.137 --> 20:39.640
Jesus Christ, Raffi!

20:39.706 --> 20:40.741
I'm not dead!

20:40.807 --> 20:41.875
You will be, though.

20:41.942 --> 20:43.610
And, Raffi, what are you
listening to in your car?

20:43.677 --> 20:45.646
I'm listening to an audio
recording of a slaughterhouse.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.648
This is not my funeral, okay?

20:47.714 --> 20:50.416
This is the funeral of this
season of the league.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.519
I can make this all go away,
you guys.

20:52.586 --> 20:53.353
Raffi!

20:53.419 --> 20:54.921
None of this counts.

20:54.988 --> 20:59.492
This whole season arrived in a
clown car of lies, and it never
happened!

20:59.560 --> 21:03.664
Ruxin still reigns as champion,
and Andre still has the Sacko.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.831
What? No.

21:04.898 --> 21:06.332
No, no, no, no, I won.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.267
No, you didn't.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.335
Yes, I'm putting my name on
the Shiva.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.137
No, you're not.

21:11.204 --> 21:13.840
I have got to win the Shiva,
because if I don't win the
Shiva, then I don't win the bet!

21:13.907 --> 21:15.876
Hey, babe?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.210
You won the bet.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.679
Huh?

21:18.745 --> 21:19.546
I'm pregnant.

21:19.613 --> 21:20.714
Wait, just because I won?

21:20.781 --> 21:22.716
No, I found out a couple
days ago.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.818
We're going to have our
own baby?

21:24.885 --> 21:25.852
Yeah.

21:25.919 --> 21:26.887
So excited!

21:26.953 --> 21:27.854
You sure it's not my baby?

21:27.921 --> 21:29.823
I did jerk off in your
underwear drawer.

21:29.890 --> 21:30.824
Ugh!

21:30.891 --> 21:31.725
All right, guys.

21:31.792 --> 21:32.392
Let's do this.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.326
No, no, no, no, no.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.294
Yes, we have to.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.128
My torch!

21:35.195 --> 21:36.129
Taco, no!

21:36.196 --> 21:37.030
Step aside, brother.

21:37.097 --> 21:37.998
I'm the commissioner!

21:38.064 --> 21:38.999
You're a figurehead!

21:39.065 --> 21:40.867
Guys, guys, stop it!

21:40.934 --> 21:42.002
This is not your fight.

21:42.068 --> 21:42.969
Get out of the way!

21:43.036 --> 21:44.237
(screaming)

21:44.304 --> 21:46.840
Oh, oh, oh, shit!

21:46.907 --> 21:48.008
I'm on fire!

21:48.074 --> 21:49.209
Guys, I'm on fire!

21:49.275 --> 21:51.077
Oh, no, you fell on the
Sacko brand!

21:51.144 --> 21:52.012
What?!

21:52.078 --> 21:54.147
Looks like you won the Sacko
after all.

21:54.214 --> 21:55.081
Yeah, and this one counts.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.550
Dicks!

21:56.617 --> 21:57.884
Yay!

21:57.951 --> 21:58.985
Andre, help!

21:59.052 --> 21:59.986
It's an emergency.

22:00.053 --> 22:00.987
Sorry, buddy.

22:01.054 --> 22:02.556
It is time.

22:02.623 --> 22:07.894
Oh, Pete, every night's going
to be Sacko steak night now!

22:07.961 --> 22:10.096
Adios, Shiva Komedi.

22:11.231 --> 22:12.132
No, what are you doing?!

22:12.198 --> 22:13.133
Oh, my God!

22:13.199 --> 22:14.434
Burn!

22:14.500 --> 22:20.974
You can take my draft pick,
but you can never take my Shiva!

22:21.041 --> 22:22.175
No.

22:22.242 --> 22:23.877
This season never happened.

22:23.944 --> 22:25.178
Yes, it did.

22:25.245 --> 22:26.179
Yes, it did.

22:26.246 --> 22:27.080
Kevin, what are you doing?

22:27.147 --> 22:28.915
Kevin, you have everything
you want.

22:28.982 --> 22:29.616
We're having a baby.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.051
Any asshole can be a father.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.252
I want to be a champion!

22:32.318 --> 22:33.153
What?

22:33.219 --> 22:35.488
I'm coming, baby!

22:35.556 --> 22:36.923
Shiva Komedi!

22:36.990 --> 22:38.024
Oh, my God!

22:38.091 --> 22:39.059
Go, Brian!

22:39.125 --> 22:41.094
Somakanakram!

22:41.161 --> 22:42.596
My brother's such an idiot.

22:42.663 --> 22:45.866
Shiva Komedi Somakanakram!
