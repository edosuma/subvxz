00:00.056 --> 00:02.028
<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty and the Beast...

00:02.029 --> 00:04.713
My husband was an archaeologist,
he was helping us on a case,

00:04.714 --> 00:06.580
and whatever he discovered
got him killed.

00:07.849 --> 00:09.950
London, 1836.

00:10.017 --> 00:11.253
Is that the same gem?

00:11.254 --> 00:13.321
Scotland Yard found it
at a murder scene.

00:13.322 --> 00:15.603
In fact, it's been found at
many murder scenes ever since,

00:15.624 --> 00:17.959
including one that
your father investigated.

00:18.026 --> 00:21.028
There is something about this
gem that is definitely connected

00:21.096 --> 00:22.896
to you, Catherine.

00:22.965 --> 00:25.232
It's a beast collar.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.700
A collar?

00:26.768 --> 00:29.903
Which implies somebody
was controlling it.

00:29.972 --> 00:33.074
Why would someone want a gem
that controls beasts?

00:33.141 --> 00:34.308
You have to get it back.

00:34.376 --> 00:36.477
No, we do.

00:43.384 --> 00:45.318
Well, you know
what's not fair?

00:45.386 --> 00:47.320
What, that my mother
didn't teach me how to cook?

00:47.388 --> 00:48.889
No.

00:48.957 --> 00:50.757
I agree to take a
celebrity cooking class

00:50.825 --> 00:52.058
hoping to get
some action...

00:52.126 --> 00:53.460
Tess, shh!
No!

00:53.528 --> 00:56.162
And you are like catnip
to every single guy.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.663
Including Chef Raymond.

00:57.731 --> 01:00.566
Okay, no more vino for you.
It's not fair.

01:00.634 --> 01:02.602
Okay, it's not my fault. I
didn't realize this was gonna be

01:02.669 --> 01:05.471
an aphrodisiac theme when
I was the one to host the class.

01:05.539 --> 01:08.441
I just hope that my canapes
don't make JT's party into...

01:08.509 --> 01:10.276
An orgy?

01:10.344 --> 01:11.978
I was going
to say disaster.

01:12.045 --> 01:13.679
You need to eat something.

01:13.747 --> 01:15.014
Not oysters.

01:15.081 --> 01:16.281
How's it going over here?

01:16.349 --> 01:17.850
Good.
Good! You know,

01:17.918 --> 01:19.952
as long as my canapes
don't go up in flames.

01:20.020 --> 01:21.353
Flambé.

01:21.421 --> 01:23.022
Mm.
It's also an aphrodisiac.

01:27.494 --> 01:29.461
I've been single too long.
Guys can sense it.

01:29.529 --> 01:31.430
No, they can't.
Yes, they can.

01:31.498 --> 01:33.332
It's a proven fact.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.501
Okay, it's anecdotal,
but it's true, all right?

01:35.568 --> 01:36.868
They don't...
they don't like desperate,

01:36.936 --> 01:38.504
and they don't like to wait.

01:38.571 --> 01:39.804
Like Gabe, for example.

01:39.872 --> 01:41.340
What do you mean,
"like Gabe"?

01:41.408 --> 01:44.142
Well, you know
he's leaving, right?

01:44.209 --> 01:46.511
Not, like, for good.
He's just leaving the precinct.

01:46.579 --> 01:49.014
He didn't tell you?

01:49.081 --> 01:50.281
No, he didn't.

01:50.349 --> 01:51.282
Why is he leaving?

01:51.350 --> 01:52.784
Well, his work is done.

01:52.852 --> 01:54.853
He cleaned up Joe's mess,
he arrested your dad.

01:54.921 --> 01:56.855
Now the D.O.J.'s
bringing it back to command.

01:56.923 --> 01:58.222
Like I said, guys don't wait.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.858
Tess, I am not
going to get

01:59.926 --> 02:01.125
into a relationship
so soon.

02:01.193 --> 02:02.360
Hey, if you don't like him...

02:02.428 --> 02:03.827
No, I-I like him,
it's just...

02:03.895 --> 02:06.330
Look, Cat, I'm all for
self-discovery, okay?

02:06.398 --> 02:08.466
God knows I'm the queen
of it right now.

02:08.533 --> 02:09.833
But it...

02:09.901 --> 02:11.222
it doesn't keep you
warm at night.

02:11.270 --> 02:12.503
And it doesn't
curl your toes.

02:12.571 --> 02:14.705
Curl my toes?

02:14.773 --> 02:16.541
I'm just saying,
use it or lose it.

02:18.610 --> 02:20.143
Hey, is everything
all right?

02:20.211 --> 02:21.745
You know what?
I'm not sure.

02:21.813 --> 02:23.681
Uh, am I calling too late?

02:23.748 --> 02:25.716
No, I'm, uh... I'm just cooking.

02:25.784 --> 02:27.417
Cooking? Really?

02:27.485 --> 02:30.020
Okay, be nice.

02:30.088 --> 02:31.521
Any sign of Agent Landon?

02:31.590 --> 02:33.223
No.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.692
No, and that's what worries me.

02:35.759 --> 02:37.727
You know, I know she's, uh,
suspicious of Tori

02:37.795 --> 02:39.162
and, you know, maybe me, too.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.198
She knows
something strange happened

02:41.265 --> 02:43.166
and she knows that
we're hiding it from her.

02:43.234 --> 02:45.435
If she finds out,
then I'm exposed

02:45.503 --> 02:47.204
and you are
completely screwed.

02:47.271 --> 02:49.706
Yeah, but I still think that
if we can figure out who killed

02:49.773 --> 02:51.774
her husband all those years ago,
maybe she'll go away.

02:51.842 --> 02:53.876
You know, I know
if we find the stolen gem,

02:53.944 --> 02:55.411
then we will find the killer.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.947
Okay, but how do we find
the gem?

02:58.015 --> 02:59.215
Well,

02:59.282 --> 03:01.417
same way that your ancestor did.

03:01.485 --> 03:05.588
Rebecca followed the same gem
when it was stolen back in 1840

03:05.656 --> 03:08.257
to get this:

03:08.325 --> 03:12.027
"a dark, gothic dungeon
filled with a treasure trove

03:12.095 --> 03:14.430
of artifacts...
and creature-like skeletons."

03:14.498 --> 03:17.266
A dungeon? In Manhattan?

03:17.334 --> 03:18.367
Apparently.

03:18.435 --> 03:19.935
Now, the problem is

03:20.003 --> 03:21.537
it's in a part of the city

03:21.605 --> 03:23.605
that doesn't exist anymore
on any map.

03:23.673 --> 03:26.274
Okay, but why would
whoever took this gem

03:26.342 --> 03:28.143
be holing themselves
up there now?

03:28.210 --> 03:30.311
Well, because it's full of
these unique artifacts

03:30.379 --> 03:33.314
that this guy's been
stealing for years, right?

03:33.382 --> 03:35.216
Besides, what better way
to hide from the FBI

03:35.284 --> 03:37.585
than a place that is
impossible to find?

03:37.654 --> 03:39.621
I don't know,
it's sounds like a long shot.

03:39.688 --> 03:42.790
Well, it's the only
shot we got.

03:42.858 --> 03:44.592
Look, Catherine,

03:44.660 --> 03:46.894
right or wrong,
I have chosen a completely

03:46.962 --> 03:48.229
different path than you.

03:48.297 --> 03:50.165
Which means as soon as
we solve this,

03:50.232 --> 03:51.832
you can finally go back
to your own life

03:51.900 --> 03:53.301
and get away
from all of this.

03:53.369 --> 03:55.936
Vincent, we've had
this conversation.

03:56.004 --> 03:57.964
Because of Rebecca,
this is as much about me as...

03:59.340 --> 04:00.775
Hey, what's going on?
You okay?

04:00.842 --> 04:02.843
Flambé. I got to go.

04:04.546 --> 04:06.147
Who was that?

04:08.216 --> 04:11.152
Catherine?

04:11.219 --> 04:13.253
Yeah.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.488
Again.

04:14.556 --> 04:16.122
"Again?" Tori, come on.
"Come on," what?

04:16.190 --> 04:17.257
You talk to her every day.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.757
What am I supposed to think?

04:18.826 --> 04:20.927
That we're trying
to get the FBI off our backs.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.095
Okay? That's what.

04:22.163 --> 04:23.263
It's not her back that we have

04:23.331 --> 04:24.598
to worry about, it's ours.

04:24.666 --> 04:26.667
That gem can hurt us,
not Catherine.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.202
Well, Agent Landon
can hurt Catherine, okay,

04:28.269 --> 04:30.369
a lot for trying to
cover this up, all right?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.305
She's just
trying to help us.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.340
She's not helping us,

04:34.408 --> 04:36.042
she's helping
you, Vincent.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.012
Listen, I'm...

04:39.080 --> 04:41.815
I'm sorry.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.683
I don't know,
I guess I'm just nervous.

04:43.751 --> 04:47.520
I know you never
promised me a future, but...

04:47.588 --> 04:52.291
we have been in some
kind of relationship, and...

04:52.359 --> 04:55.794
I guess I was just
hoping that...

04:55.862 --> 05:00.299
you'd stop sneaking out of bed
every night to call her.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.134
Okay, I'm sorry.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.002
What do you
want me to say?

05:04.070 --> 05:06.138
That you don't want
to go back to her.

05:09.575 --> 05:10.876
Do you?
You know, right now,

05:10.944 --> 05:12.510
all I want is
to find out

05:12.578 --> 05:14.813
whoever has that damn gem
and stop them before

05:14.881 --> 05:16.815
Agent Landon finds out
what's really going on.

05:38.886 --> 05:40.687
Thank you. Thanks.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.400
Please, you're
embarrassing me, okay?

05:46.227 --> 05:47.193
Sir.

05:47.261 --> 05:49.161
He's blushing.

05:49.230 --> 05:50.896
I don't think
he's used to the limelight.

05:50.964 --> 05:52.332
Well, he better
get used to it.

05:52.399 --> 05:53.999
Winning the Brady
Wright Research Grant

05:54.067 --> 05:55.384
is like winning the Super
Bowl for a scientist.

05:55.385 --> 05:57.587
It's, like, a $500,000 grant, isn't it?
Yeah.

05:57.654 --> 05:58.614
And he gets his own lab.

05:58.655 --> 05:59.888
He deserves it--

05:59.956 --> 06:01.257
everything he sacrificed
for you-know-who.

06:01.325 --> 06:03.058
Wait, what do I get
for my sacrifice?

06:03.126 --> 06:04.260
Curled toes.

06:06.062 --> 06:08.397
So, Gabe,
I hear you're leaving.

06:08.465 --> 06:10.700
I'm going to try
one of your canapes.

06:10.767 --> 06:11.900
Wish me luck.

06:11.968 --> 06:14.369
Weren't you going
to tell me?

06:14.437 --> 06:16.105
Of course I was.

06:16.172 --> 06:17.672
I just, um...

06:17.741 --> 06:19.674
I didn't, because...

06:19.743 --> 06:22.444
I didn't want you to think that
it had anything to do with us.

06:22.511 --> 06:24.113
It doesn't?
No.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.514
Catherine, I told you that
I'd wait for you, and I will.

06:26.582 --> 06:28.751
At the same time, I just...
I feel like I need to move on

06:28.818 --> 06:29.885
with my professional life.

06:29.953 --> 06:31.753
See what else
is out there for me.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.421
Especially after everything
I've gone through

06:33.489 --> 06:34.889
with you-know-who.

06:34.957 --> 06:36.124
Hey.

06:36.191 --> 06:37.125
Speaking of.

06:38.461 --> 06:39.594
Hey, Vincent, Tori.

06:39.662 --> 06:40.629
Hi.
Yeah, sorry we're late.

06:40.696 --> 06:41.630
Nice dress.

06:41.697 --> 06:43.365
Thanks.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.033
Hey, Gabe, have you had

06:46.101 --> 06:48.236
a chance to look at
Agent Landon's files yet?

06:48.303 --> 06:50.638
Well, she has a list of
possible suspects who could be

06:50.705 --> 06:52.940
responsible for the heist,
but it's a long list.

06:53.008 --> 06:55.076
We're going to
have to narrow it down.

06:55.144 --> 06:57.311
Wondering who might just
happen to own a dungeon.

06:57.379 --> 06:59.413
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you guys about.

06:59.481 --> 07:01.561
I was hoping maybe we could
cross-reference the names

07:01.616 --> 07:02.884
on Landon's list
with the, uh,

07:02.951 --> 07:04.485
locations of Rebecca's files.

07:04.552 --> 07:06.052
Maybe we could try
and figure out

07:06.120 --> 07:07.640
where this "dungeon"
could actually be.

07:07.656 --> 07:09.323
Uh, I'm sorry, "dungeon"?

07:12.126 --> 07:15.462
Oh, um, Rebecca-- she found
the same gem there back in 1840,

07:15.530 --> 07:17.731
but we don't know where
the dungeon is today.

07:17.799 --> 07:19.933
City's different now.

07:21.468 --> 07:23.736
Hey, look who I found.

07:23.805 --> 07:24.971
Man of the hour.

07:25.039 --> 07:26.039
JT, I'm so happy for you.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.240
Thank you, thank you.

07:27.308 --> 07:28.508
Yeah.

07:28.575 --> 07:29.509
When do you finally
get to see your lab?

07:29.576 --> 07:30.510
Uh, they're coming to

07:30.577 --> 07:31.978
pick me up in a couple minutes.

07:32.046 --> 07:33.280
- Limo.
- Oh.

07:33.347 --> 07:35.315
I'm just saying.
Limo?

07:35.382 --> 07:37.517
Getting a little cocky there, huh?
Damn right!

07:37.584 --> 07:39.686
Still can't believe this is
actually happening to me

07:39.753 --> 07:41.487
after all these years.

07:41.555 --> 07:43.823
I love you guys.
Really.

07:44.991 --> 07:45.991
Okay, okay.

07:46.059 --> 07:47.627
Come on.
Bring it in.

07:48.729 --> 07:49.962
Oh.

07:59.405 --> 08:01.340
Okay. Excuse me
for one second.

08:01.407 --> 08:02.674
Did I miss something?

08:04.878 --> 08:07.012
Really good.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.448
Really, very good.

08:09.515 --> 08:11.483
Victoria.

08:11.551 --> 08:13.485
Hey, Tori.

08:13.553 --> 08:14.519
No, it's fine.

08:14.587 --> 08:15.987
Just go back to your friends.

08:16.055 --> 08:17.489
Come on, talk to me,
tell me what's wrong.

08:17.557 --> 08:19.491
What's wrong?
Are you kidding?

08:19.559 --> 08:21.860
Did-did you see the way
they were treating me in there?

08:21.927 --> 08:23.562
What do you mean?

08:23.629 --> 08:25.364
Never mind.

08:25.431 --> 08:28.166
No, come on,
tell me what's wrong.

08:28.234 --> 08:30.168
Honestly...

08:30.236 --> 08:31.836
I feel like
I'm losing you, Vincent.

08:31.904 --> 08:34.138
And I don't know
what else I can do

08:34.206 --> 08:35.673
to stop it
from happening either.

08:35.741 --> 08:38.142
Look, I'm just...

08:38.210 --> 08:39.744
I'm a little preoccupied, okay,

08:39.811 --> 08:41.511
with finding this gem;
we all are.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.314
No, we aren't. You are.

08:44.383 --> 08:47.485
Catherine is, your friends are,
but I'm-I'm not a part of it.

08:47.552 --> 08:49.152
As though it has
nothing to do with me,

08:49.220 --> 08:51.822
when actually it has
everything to do with me.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.223
W-With us.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.158
We've been through
all of this.

08:55.226 --> 08:57.194
No, it's not just
about the gem,

08:57.262 --> 08:58.396
and you know it.

08:58.463 --> 09:00.563
Be honest.

09:00.631 --> 09:02.832
I can sense how you feel.

09:02.901 --> 09:05.835
I can sense your heartbeat.

09:05.904 --> 09:07.771
You taught me, remember?

09:10.174 --> 09:13.543
I don't want
to lose you, Vincent.

09:13.611 --> 09:15.345
You're all... you're all I have.

09:15.413 --> 09:16.846
I don't have anybody else.

09:16.914 --> 09:18.848
I don't have any friends.

09:21.419 --> 09:23.352
You're all I've got.

09:23.421 --> 09:26.188
And I think that might be
part of the problem.

09:26.256 --> 09:28.190
All I know is that

09:28.258 --> 09:29.793
when we're together,
there's something

09:29.860 --> 09:32.361
about your power that...

09:32.429 --> 09:34.964
It doesn't just amplify mine,
okay, it affects everything.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.732
The way think,
the way I feel...

09:36.800 --> 09:39.035
I don't... I don't understand.

09:39.102 --> 09:40.102
I don't know.

09:40.170 --> 09:43.406
I chose a path with you and...

09:45.508 --> 09:47.709
...I think maybe we just need
a little time apart

09:47.777 --> 09:50.612
from each other so we can
think things through, okay?

09:50.680 --> 09:53.782
You mean, so you can
think things through.

10:02.492 --> 10:03.772
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

10:03.827 --> 10:05.493
To see my new lab.
Want to come?

10:05.561 --> 10:08.496
Oh, uh, I wish I could, man,
but I just got stuff going on.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.265
Say no more.
Wish me luck.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.333
Good luck.

10:16.538 --> 10:18.473
Is everything okay?

10:18.540 --> 10:19.907
You bring Rebecca's case file?

10:19.976 --> 10:21.909
No.

10:21.977 --> 10:23.911
No, I left it
at my place.

10:23.979 --> 10:26.514
We were thinking of
using it to track her path

10:26.582 --> 10:28.248
to the dungeon
using an old map.

10:28.316 --> 10:30.451
Yeah, and compare it to a modern
map with the suspect list,

10:30.519 --> 10:32.119
see if any names
match locations.

10:32.187 --> 10:35.189
Okay, according to the file,
Rebecca was last seen

10:35.256 --> 10:38.025
heading uptown, to a place
called, uh, Carmanville.

10:38.093 --> 10:40.427
Carmanville?
Yeah, well, it doesn't exist anymore,

10:40.495 --> 10:41.962
but in the
scheme of things,

10:42.030 --> 10:43.663
it'd probably be
Washington Heights now.

10:43.731 --> 10:45.132
Let's go.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.200
I will be right there.

10:46.267 --> 10:48.635
All right,
th-thanks, guys.

10:53.041 --> 10:54.708
Are you okay?
No.

10:54.775 --> 10:56.376
Everyone wants to move on
with their lives, but,

10:56.443 --> 10:59.145
you know, I just feel
bad because they can't.

10:59.213 --> 11:00.647
They got to deal
with this first.

11:00.715 --> 11:02.215
That's what friends are for.

11:02.282 --> 11:04.150
Is that what we are now?

11:04.218 --> 11:05.184
Friends?

11:05.252 --> 11:07.521
It's better than enemies.

11:10.892 --> 11:13.126
Vincent, just 'cause
we're not together anymore

11:13.193 --> 11:15.995
doesn't mean that we don't
still have a history together,

11:16.063 --> 11:18.131
that we don't still care
about each other.

11:18.198 --> 11:21.034
And that is why
I'm going to offer you

11:21.101 --> 11:22.335
some friendly advice.

11:22.403 --> 11:24.137
Okay.

11:24.204 --> 11:25.371
Talk to Tori.

11:25.439 --> 11:27.140
What?

11:27.207 --> 11:31.376
Well, it wasn't easy for me
being with you at first either.

11:31.444 --> 11:33.979
You tend to shut people out.

11:34.047 --> 11:35.313
You want to solve
everything by yourself.

11:35.381 --> 11:39.518
Keeps her guessing,
worrying.

11:39.586 --> 11:41.587
Trust me, I know.

11:41.655 --> 11:43.889
Sorry I was such a pain.

11:51.797 --> 11:54.766
I should go.

11:58.504 --> 12:00.605
All right.

12:13.518 --> 12:15.386
What are you doing?

12:26.498 --> 12:29.366
I got it.

12:37.441 --> 12:38.942
Professor Forbes.

12:39.010 --> 12:40.276
Tony Barnes.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.945
I work for
the Brady Wright Foundation.

12:42.013 --> 12:43.647
Welcome.
Hi, cool, thanks.

12:43.715 --> 12:45.616
Uh, this where the lab is?

12:45.683 --> 12:46.950
Just downstairs.

12:47.018 --> 12:48.284
By the way, thank
you for forwarding

12:48.352 --> 12:49.753
all your research
files in advance.

12:49.821 --> 12:50.886
It'll help
expedite things.

12:50.954 --> 12:52.422
Sure, no problem.

12:52.490 --> 12:54.324
I guess I was
kind of figuring

12:54.391 --> 12:56.259
it would be more downtown,
you know.

12:56.327 --> 12:57.660
SoHo, Wall Street.

12:57.728 --> 13:00.263
Zoning.
OSHA's clamping down.

13:00.331 --> 13:01.297
After you.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.274
There's not any mold
down here, is there?

13:12.342 --> 13:13.909
No, no mold.

13:13.977 --> 13:16.245
Good, you know,
'cause I'm kind of allergic.

13:16.312 --> 13:19.414
Also I'm, uh...
more of a window guy.

13:19.482 --> 13:21.751
So, um, there isn't
a chance we can

13:21.818 --> 13:23.619
move the lab
above ground, is there?

13:23.686 --> 13:25.621
Sorry.

13:36.599 --> 13:38.267
Run!

13:38.334 --> 13:39.934
Get out while you can!

14:08.743 --> 14:11.344
They did
the same thing to me.

14:13.547 --> 14:14.680
Five years ago.

14:14.748 --> 14:16.316
Or, uh, was it six?

14:16.383 --> 14:17.483
Hey, what year is it?

14:17.551 --> 14:18.985
Sorry?

14:19.053 --> 14:21.387
Is it 2013 still?

14:23.157 --> 14:24.757
No, '14.

14:29.128 --> 14:31.063
What the hell?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.334
Help!

14:35.402 --> 14:36.335
Somebody help me!

14:36.403 --> 14:37.536
Hey, hey, hey. It's no use.

14:37.604 --> 14:38.738
This dungeon's been here

14:38.805 --> 14:40.005
for, like,
a couple hundred years.

14:40.073 --> 14:41.540
It's solid stone.

14:41.608 --> 14:43.876
I don't understand
what's going on.

14:43.943 --> 14:45.911
Why are they doing this to me?
This isn't right!

14:45.979 --> 14:49.581
I won the Brady Wright Grant
for God sakes!

14:49.648 --> 14:52.284
They cut you,
and they took your shirt.

14:52.352 --> 14:53.852
I don't know why they did it,
but they did.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.089
Who the hell are you?

14:57.156 --> 15:00.224
I'm you.

15:00.292 --> 15:02.727
I mean, before they put me
in here anyways.

15:02.795 --> 15:04.863
Couldn't mix the right serum
the way they wanted,

15:04.930 --> 15:06.531
so they caged me,
the rat bastards!

15:08.667 --> 15:10.769
So that I could help you
figure it out, I guess.

15:10.836 --> 15:12.136
Figure what out?

15:15.173 --> 15:17.241
Just do as they say.

15:21.846 --> 15:24.382
Ah, good, you're awake.

15:24.449 --> 15:25.783
Look, pal, I don't know
what you want...

15:25.850 --> 15:27.084
Let me tell you what I want.

15:27.152 --> 15:28.585
I want you to replicate

15:28.653 --> 15:31.289
the serum Muirfield
used to make...

15:31.356 --> 15:35.459
How did you refer to them in
your secret research? Beasts.

15:35.527 --> 15:38.295
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:38.362 --> 15:40.130
Come on, you're
a smart guy.

15:40.197 --> 15:41.732
Brilliant, actually.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.835
But I'm a pretty
smart guy, too.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.303
So, let's not play games.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.504
By now, you figured out
I tricked you

15:48.572 --> 15:50.006
into thinking you won the grant,

15:50.074 --> 15:52.508
only to gain access to
your encrypted files.

15:52.576 --> 15:55.678
Especially those
on cross-species DNA.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.914
See, now you know I'm
telling the truth.

15:57.982 --> 16:00.083
And now you understand
what I want.

16:00.151 --> 16:01.584
Do I?

16:01.652 --> 16:03.420
I also know you got hold

16:03.487 --> 16:05.955
of Windsor's creature skeleton
and the collar.

16:06.022 --> 16:07.824
How do I know that?

16:07.891 --> 16:09.158
Because I'm the
one who's been

16:09.225 --> 16:10.760
paying people to
steal artifacts.

16:10.828 --> 16:13.262
And once they took that
from you, I began to wonder.

16:13.330 --> 16:14.997
How did you get it?

16:15.065 --> 16:18.334
Unless, of course, you knew
something about beasts.

16:18.401 --> 16:22.171
Or better yet...

16:22.238 --> 16:24.039
know one.

16:29.279 --> 16:32.147
I've pulled every ingredient
from my research,

16:32.215 --> 16:33.849
Muirfield's and yours.

16:33.916 --> 16:35.017
Which means

16:35.085 --> 16:37.219
that here is
everything you need

16:37.287 --> 16:39.521
to figure out
how to make the serum.

16:39.589 --> 16:42.991
And the sooner you make it,
the sooner you can go.

16:43.058 --> 16:46.361
Look, I may be an idiot
for getting duped,

16:46.428 --> 16:47.696
but I'm not stupid.

16:47.763 --> 16:49.243
Even if I knew
how to make this serum,

16:49.298 --> 16:51.199
which I don't,

16:51.266 --> 16:54.202
you wouldn't let me go anyway,
so screw you.

16:55.737 --> 16:59.240
Are you sure you don't want
to at least try?

16:59.308 --> 17:00.908
No!

17:00.976 --> 17:02.477
Please, dear God.

17:02.544 --> 17:04.178
Don't let him shoot me.
Do what he says.

17:04.246 --> 17:06.314
Hmm?
Just do what he says.

17:27.402 --> 17:29.536
Oh...
She was going through your things!

17:29.603 --> 17:30.904
Are you out
of your mind?!

17:30.971 --> 17:32.105
What was I supposed
to do, let her go?

17:32.173 --> 17:33.907
Yes, Tori! She's FBI!

17:33.974 --> 17:36.135
You said she was a threat!
So you tied her up instead?!

17:36.144 --> 17:37.277
No, don't let her...
Get off me!

17:37.345 --> 17:38.445
Damn it, I said no!

18:02.969 --> 18:04.636
Hey.
Hey.

18:04.704 --> 18:05.984
Did Vincent bring
Rebecca's file?

18:06.039 --> 18:07.706
No, and I can't get
ahold of him either.

18:07.774 --> 18:09.141
Are you worried?

18:09.209 --> 18:10.809
Always.

18:10.877 --> 18:12.878
Okay, well, here's
what I got so far.

18:12.946 --> 18:15.247
Seven of the names on
Agent Landon's suspect list

18:15.315 --> 18:17.749
match up with
properties inside of

18:17.817 --> 18:19.317
the old Carmanville.
Are any of them dungeons?

18:19.385 --> 18:20.752
No, no dungeons.

18:20.820 --> 18:22.253
And none of them mentioned
in any of my research

18:22.321 --> 18:23.589
in Rebecca's time either.

18:23.656 --> 18:24.823
Well, there has to
be one somewhere.

18:24.891 --> 18:27.926
She was pretty specific.

18:27.994 --> 18:31.229
It's strange having an ancestor
involved in all this, too.

18:31.297 --> 18:32.798
Makes you think.

18:32.865 --> 18:34.799
About?

18:34.866 --> 18:37.768
About fate, destiny.

18:37.836 --> 18:40.138
I mean, it's a
little eerie.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.806
I'm following the same
investigation she did,

18:41.873 --> 18:43.308
looking for the
same gem she was.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.943
Trying to figure out
who's after beasts,

18:46.011 --> 18:47.945
200 years later.

18:48.013 --> 18:50.681
Maybe you're meant to solve
something she couldn't.

18:50.749 --> 18:52.683
So you can move on.

18:54.886 --> 18:57.187
Like you are?

18:59.257 --> 19:01.492
Catherine, please don't
take it personally.

19:01.559 --> 19:03.193
I'm just, um...

19:03.261 --> 19:04.929
I need a change.

19:04.997 --> 19:05.963
We both do.

19:06.031 --> 19:07.464
I mean,
if you think about it,

19:07.532 --> 19:09.266
we have spent
most of our time together

19:09.334 --> 19:11.635
dealing with... beasts.

19:11.702 --> 19:14.704
I mean, me, Vincent, good, bad,
it's defined us.

19:14.772 --> 19:16.373
It still does.

19:16.441 --> 19:18.008
I know.

19:18.075 --> 19:21.278
It doesn't mean that I don't
want to be with you.

19:21.346 --> 19:26.016
But I am also trying
to honor what you want.

19:26.083 --> 19:30.219
I'm still trying to figure out
what it is I want exactly.

19:32.456 --> 19:34.290
Hey.

19:34.358 --> 19:36.225
Don't you ever knock?

19:36.293 --> 19:38.294
Not when I think
JT's just been kidnapped.

19:45.235 --> 19:46.735
You have anything stronger?

19:46.803 --> 19:47.970
What would you like?

19:48.038 --> 19:49.639
I don't know.

19:49.706 --> 19:52.508
I don't really think
anything's gonna help.

19:52.576 --> 19:54.343
You're not gonna
hurt me, are you?

19:54.411 --> 19:56.244
No, I am not
gonna hurt you.

19:56.312 --> 19:58.080
I just...
I need to explain, okay?

19:58.148 --> 19:59.715
Look, my friend--

19:59.783 --> 20:02.918
he has done a lot of research
on what it is that I am.

20:02.986 --> 20:04.720
It is all here and I
will show it to you,

20:04.788 --> 20:05.988
everything that
you need to know.

20:06.056 --> 20:06.989
Why?

20:07.057 --> 20:08.590
Because my only other option

20:08.658 --> 20:09.758
is to kill you.

20:11.227 --> 20:13.662
I'm sorry... I'm joking.

20:13.729 --> 20:15.263
Funny.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.401
I mean, I knew
something was going on,

20:19.468 --> 20:21.536
something that exceeded
all of my training,

20:21.604 --> 20:23.838
but what I saw...

20:23.906 --> 20:25.740
What did I see?

20:25.808 --> 20:28.910
Well, something that
some people would pay

20:28.977 --> 20:31.545
a lot of money to see
for themselves.

20:31.613 --> 20:33.881
Somebody like
whoever killed my husband?

20:33.949 --> 20:35.282
And who's behind these heists?

20:35.350 --> 20:37.018
Yeah.

20:37.086 --> 20:39.921
Look, now that you know
about us,

20:39.988 --> 20:41.889
I was hoping
that we could work together

20:41.957 --> 20:43.390
to try and find them.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.259
So this whole secret,
this must have been

20:45.327 --> 20:47.361
what Sam stumbled across
in his last dig

20:47.429 --> 20:49.096
and what got him killed.

20:49.163 --> 20:51.265
I mean, why do they want
this gem so badly?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.367
Because it can stop us.

20:53.435 --> 20:55.636
It takes away my power
and my strength.

20:55.704 --> 20:57.804
Look, I had no idea
about this thing

20:57.872 --> 20:59.240
until you brought it
to our attention.

20:59.307 --> 21:00.774
And now that I know,

21:00.842 --> 21:02.909
I need to get it away
from whoever has it

21:02.977 --> 21:04.778
before they use
it against me.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.147
And I need to stop them
for what they did to Sam.

21:08.382 --> 21:10.150
Is JT here?

21:10.218 --> 21:11.417
JT? No, why?

21:11.485 --> 21:12.819
Agent Landon?

21:12.887 --> 21:14.154
It's okay, she knows.

21:14.222 --> 21:15.756
About what?

21:15.823 --> 21:16.990
Enough to help.

21:18.859 --> 21:19.925
Is JT okay?

21:19.993 --> 21:21.461
No, he's been kidnapped.

21:21.528 --> 21:23.663
What?
Yeah. Someone got his contact list.

21:23.731 --> 21:25.998
They sent out a mass e-mail;
they wrote it cryptically

21:26.066 --> 21:27.133
so that everyone else
thinks it's innocent.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.434
Everyone except those of us

21:28.502 --> 21:29.502
who knows about beasts.

21:29.570 --> 21:30.836
Does it say
what they want?

21:30.904 --> 21:31.904
Yeah.

21:33.674 --> 21:35.007
You.

21:38.376 --> 21:39.843
Sending the mass
e-mail's smart.

21:39.910 --> 21:41.177
They're casting a wide net
to see who will bite.

21:41.409 --> 21:42.730
Plus, sending it
from JT's account

21:42.777 --> 21:44.144
keeps anyone from
tracing it back to them.

21:44.212 --> 21:46.380
"23rd and 7th. Sense sweater."

21:46.447 --> 21:47.680
"Sense sweater."
What does that mean?

21:47.748 --> 21:48.908
It means they know
that beasts

21:48.950 --> 21:50.217
can track using their senses.

21:50.285 --> 21:51.851
Which is exactly
what I'm gonna do.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.241
No, Vincent, wait.
Why, Catherine?

21:53.288 --> 21:54.922
They're after me, not JT.

21:54.989 --> 21:56.709
Yeah, but they don't know
it's you for sure.

21:56.757 --> 21:58.090
Otherwise they wouldn't have
sent an e-mail to everyone.

21:58.158 --> 21:59.893
They want a beast,
okay, and that is me!

21:59.960 --> 22:01.561
Okay, but why
would they lure you

22:01.629 --> 22:02.995
if they didn't know they
could already handle you?

22:03.063 --> 22:05.197
The gem.
They've obviously got it.

22:05.265 --> 22:06.866
Otherwise, it'd be suicide
to want you.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.234
We should follow Vincent
while he follows the clues

22:08.302 --> 22:10.403
and back him up.
It's too risky.

22:10.471 --> 22:11.871
If they're following him,
then JT...

22:13.606 --> 22:15.541
Vincent, this isn't your fault.
The hell it is, okay?!

22:15.608 --> 22:17.944
Everyone is here wasting
their time because of me!

22:18.011 --> 22:20.079
Now JT-- JT is kidnapped!

22:20.147 --> 22:22.281
The man thinks he won a grant,
for God's sake!

22:22.349 --> 22:23.282
You need to calm down
and think this through.

22:23.350 --> 22:24.917
No, we need to save JT.

22:24.985 --> 22:27.119
And we will, together.

22:27.187 --> 22:29.054
JT?

22:29.121 --> 22:30.789
No, it's me.

22:30.857 --> 22:32.190
Tori, hey.

22:32.258 --> 22:33.391
Look, I can't
talk right now.

22:33.460 --> 22:34.860
Something's come up.

22:34.928 --> 22:36.061
No, I screwed up.

22:36.128 --> 22:38.229
I exposed us to an FBI agent

22:38.297 --> 22:40.265
for God sakes. I'm sorry.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.033
I just feel like I can't do
anything right anymore.

22:42.101 --> 22:44.202
Tori, come on.
Everything is out of control,

22:44.270 --> 22:46.771
a little messed up right now,
but I will talk to you

22:46.839 --> 22:48.119
about this a little later, okay?

22:48.140 --> 22:49.140
Did something happen?

22:49.208 --> 22:51.642
Yes. JT's been kidnapped.

22:51.710 --> 22:53.411
What?

22:53.479 --> 22:55.813
Look, we got it under control.
Don't worry about it.

22:55.881 --> 22:57.748
I'll talk to you later.
Wait. I-I could help.

22:57.816 --> 22:59.784
I saw him leave the party;
I could track him.

23:06.391 --> 23:08.993
Look, I got to find JT, okay?
I can't let them hurt him.

23:09.060 --> 23:10.163
Vincent...

23:10.188 --> 23:11.673
He's right.
We're running out of time.

23:11.674 --> 23:13.714
They just sent another e-mail.
It says, "Tick-tock."

23:14.276 --> 23:16.044
- Is Tess still at the precinct?
- I think so.

23:16.111 --> 23:17.178
I'm gonna go narrow down
the suspect list.

23:17.246 --> 23:18.607
I know it better
than anybody else.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.048
Vincent, did you bring
Rebecca's files?

23:20.115 --> 23:21.782
Yeah, it's behind
the bar.

23:21.850 --> 23:23.117
Great. Okay, we'll head up
to Washington Heights.

23:23.185 --> 23:24.852
We'll keep in touch
with you via phone,

23:24.920 --> 23:26.687
and try and figure out
where that dungeon is together.

23:26.755 --> 23:27.821
Okay. I can't wait
for you though.

23:27.889 --> 23:28.889
That's fine. You save JT.

23:28.890 --> 23:29.823
We'll save you.

23:31.026 --> 23:32.460
Yeah.

24:07.328 --> 24:09.062
You've been down here
a long time.

24:09.129 --> 24:11.097
What do you know
about this Barnes guy?

24:11.164 --> 24:12.531
Um, he cheats at cards.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.033
But he's a Yankees fan, so...

24:14.101 --> 24:15.735
I meant about
all of this.

24:15.803 --> 24:18.270
Why he wants the serum,
why he's holed up down here.

24:18.338 --> 24:21.540
He wants to make one of those,
um-- what do you call it?

24:21.609 --> 24:22.675
A beast?

24:22.743 --> 24:24.243
Yeah, that.
He wants to make that.

24:24.311 --> 24:26.345
And why here?
I don't know.

24:26.413 --> 24:29.848
I guess so he can...
contain it.

24:35.616 --> 24:39.051
Um, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

24:39.119 --> 24:41.120
I know what I'm doing,
thank you.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.788
Yeah, but that's
not gonna fool him.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.590
Look, it's not just your ass
on the line, okay?

24:44.657 --> 24:46.658
It's mine, too.

24:46.726 --> 24:48.294
You can't just combine
synthetic transuranic elements.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.296
You know that
and he knows that.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.663
So, what?
So, what if he tries

24:51.731 --> 24:52.898
that concoction
on one of us, huh?

24:52.966 --> 24:54.633
You want to die?
'Cause you will.

24:54.701 --> 24:57.303
I was hoping that he'd try it
on himself instead.

24:57.371 --> 24:58.604
Well, he's not stupid.

24:58.671 --> 24:59.938
He's mean,
but he's not stupid.

25:00.006 --> 25:02.975
I'm not doing what he wants.

25:03.042 --> 25:04.643
Yeah, well, then
he's gonna kill you

25:04.711 --> 25:06.678
and he's gonna kill
your beast.

25:06.746 --> 25:10.115
Yeah. They know
you got one.

25:10.182 --> 25:13.318
They sent out a ransom.
I heard them. You for it.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.286
That's why they want
to make the serum.

25:15.354 --> 25:17.088
They want to combine it
with beast blood.

25:17.156 --> 25:18.856
They want to make
a better mousetrap.

25:21.727 --> 25:22.660
JT.

25:24.096 --> 25:25.997
Tori? What are
you doing here?

25:26.065 --> 25:28.033
What does it look
like I'm doing?

25:28.100 --> 25:29.300
Who's that?
Shh!

25:29.368 --> 25:31.035
You have to get out
of here now!

25:31.102 --> 25:32.537
Not without you.

25:32.604 --> 25:35.105
You don't understand.
It's a trap!

25:38.777 --> 25:39.877
Whoa, is she it?

25:41.413 --> 25:42.379
It's a girl?

25:42.447 --> 25:44.048
Come on!

25:54.725 --> 25:58.495
Isn't it nice to know
you've got friends who care?

26:30.521 --> 26:33.589
Never imagined you were a beast.

26:33.657 --> 26:37.292
Your father, sure, but...

26:37.360 --> 26:38.994
We should've known.

26:39.062 --> 26:43.365
Would've saved us an awful lot
of time and money.

26:48.038 --> 26:49.971
Take care.

26:59.081 --> 27:00.815
Okay, we're in
Washington Heights.

27:00.883 --> 27:02.551
Did Rebecca mention
any landmarks

27:02.618 --> 27:03.985
we can try
and reference?

27:04.053 --> 27:06.721
Um, she mentioned having
to cross Milstone Brook.

27:06.789 --> 27:09.824
That's where... that's where
Hamilton Square is now.

27:09.892 --> 27:11.459
I know where Hamilton Square is.

27:11.527 --> 27:13.027
Turn left on 139th.

27:31.379 --> 27:33.513
You sure you know
what you're doing?

27:33.582 --> 27:34.982
Shut up.

27:35.050 --> 27:35.983
Okay.

27:45.759 --> 27:47.094
Nicely done.

27:47.161 --> 27:49.162
I don't know if it's right.

27:49.230 --> 27:51.498
I'm not sure I replicated
anything Muirfield did.

27:51.566 --> 27:53.600
Better than
I was able to do.

28:04.177 --> 28:06.412
What am I doing?

28:06.480 --> 28:08.881
You're saving
your friend's life.

28:19.126 --> 28:20.092
Vincent!

28:20.160 --> 28:22.461
Hey, you okay, buddy? You okay?

28:22.529 --> 28:24.530
Yeah.
Good.

28:24.598 --> 28:25.931
Who's he?

28:25.999 --> 28:27.766
Uh, I don't know.
A prisoner.

28:33.506 --> 28:34.906
Another one?
Another one?

28:34.974 --> 28:35.907
What do you mean?

28:35.975 --> 28:37.475
JT, what does he mean?

28:39.278 --> 28:40.378
Tori. They have Tori.

28:40.446 --> 28:42.047
What? How?

28:42.115 --> 28:43.755
I thought you knew.
She came to rescue me.

28:43.816 --> 28:44.783
No.

28:44.851 --> 28:46.284
All right, uh, take my phone.

28:46.352 --> 28:48.720
Get out of here,
call Catherine,

28:48.788 --> 28:50.555
tell her where I am, okay?
Where are you going?

28:50.623 --> 28:51.989
To find Tori.

29:02.901 --> 29:06.937
Okay, we're approaching,
uh, 149th on Riverside.

29:07.005 --> 29:10.507
Rebecca mentioned a huge factory
nearby with a smokestack.

29:10.575 --> 29:13.410
There's an abandoned
meatpacking factory off 153rd.

29:13.478 --> 29:15.179
Tony Barnes.

29:15.246 --> 29:16.981
He's one of our suspects.
What? Who?

29:17.049 --> 29:19.083
He owns a lot of buildings
in Manhattan,

29:19.151 --> 29:21.585
but he happens to own one
at 153rd and Riverside.

29:21.653 --> 29:23.153
We're coming up on 153rd now.

29:24.422 --> 29:26.490
Smokestack. There.

29:28.993 --> 29:30.694
No, stop! Stop!

29:30.761 --> 29:32.095
No, stop!

29:37.335 --> 29:39.135
Tori?

29:39.203 --> 29:40.503
Tori. Hey.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.538
Tori. Tori, wake up.

29:42.606 --> 29:45.308
Tori, come on, wake up.

29:45.375 --> 29:46.475
Tori!

29:47.678 --> 29:49.612
Tori, come on.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.647
Stick with me, okay?
It's Vincent.

29:51.716 --> 29:52.648
Vincent?

29:52.717 --> 29:54.017
Yeah. You okay?

29:54.085 --> 29:55.951
Come on. We got to get you
out of here.

29:57.688 --> 29:59.788
All right, where does it hurt?

29:59.856 --> 30:01.957
Everywhere.

30:02.025 --> 30:04.560
I guess I screwed up again, huh?

30:04.628 --> 30:08.331
No, Tori you did real good,
okay? JT is safe.

30:08.398 --> 30:10.333
Yeah?
Yeah.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.634
You did real good, okay?

30:11.702 --> 30:12.868
Now I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.037
Come on. Come on!
No. No!

30:15.105 --> 30:16.638
It's too late.

30:18.708 --> 30:20.909
It's okay.

30:20.977 --> 30:24.179
No, no, it's not.

30:24.247 --> 30:26.849
Tori, I'm so sorry.

30:26.916 --> 30:29.016
I should've protected you.

30:29.084 --> 30:31.686
I... I should've known.

30:31.754 --> 30:34.856
No. No, I should've known.

30:34.923 --> 30:38.226
You belong with Catherine.

30:46.568 --> 30:50.071
Two beasts-- such luck.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.506
I never imagined.

30:54.943 --> 30:57.344
Open the gate!
She needs to go to a hospital.

30:57.412 --> 31:00.114
I think we both know
she's past that.

31:02.317 --> 31:04.685
Why do you think
I picked this place?

31:06.321 --> 31:07.954
Built hundreds
of years ago,

31:08.022 --> 31:11.725
built specifically to hold,
frankly, the likes of you.

31:14.262 --> 31:17.531
But I got what I need from her,
so I don't need you.

31:17.599 --> 31:21.768
I don't want to worry about you
trying to track me down either.

31:46.293 --> 31:48.561
Tori.

31:52.199 --> 31:53.565
No.

32:24.462 --> 32:26.397
You know, she was
just trying to help.

32:26.464 --> 32:27.898
She did.

32:27.965 --> 32:29.266
If it wasn't for her,

32:29.333 --> 32:30.901
then Barnes would've
gotten to you,

32:30.968 --> 32:32.809
and then you wouldn't have
been able to save JT

32:32.836 --> 32:35.071
and I wouldn't have
been able to save you.

32:35.139 --> 32:37.573
Well, at least Tori
would still be alive.

32:38.842 --> 32:41.211
Vincent, it's not your fault.

32:41.279 --> 32:42.913
You didn't ask her to come here.

32:42.980 --> 32:46.282
No. No, I didn't,
but she came because of me.

32:46.349 --> 32:47.950
You know, she came hoping that

32:48.018 --> 32:49.919
she could make things
right between us.

32:51.488 --> 32:53.956
You know why
I shut people out?

32:54.024 --> 32:56.959
Why I shut you out at first?

32:57.027 --> 32:58.694
Because I was so worried

32:58.762 --> 33:00.797
that something like this
would happen to you.

33:00.864 --> 33:03.265
People close to me,
they get hurt.

33:03.333 --> 33:06.101
Yeah, but that isn't
your fault either.

33:06.169 --> 33:08.203
You didn't ask
to become what you are.

33:08.271 --> 33:12.641
No, but I chose this path
and I took Tori with me.

33:12.708 --> 33:15.110
Anyone close to me is always
going to be in danger,

33:15.178 --> 33:16.946
'cause there's always
going to be someone after me.

33:17.013 --> 33:18.947
Okay, but Barnes is dead.

33:19.014 --> 33:20.749
He's the one who was
behind all the heists;

33:20.817 --> 33:22.317
he was behind
everything.

33:22.384 --> 33:24.319
Yeah, but what about Muirfield,
and your father, and...

33:24.386 --> 33:26.822
the next guy after that
and the next guy

33:26.889 --> 33:29.658
after that until someone
finally catches me?

33:31.293 --> 33:33.728
You know, just like
someone caught him.

33:33.796 --> 33:36.597
How do you know
Rebecca didn't save him?

33:36.665 --> 33:39.733
How do you know
she didn't die trying?

33:43.872 --> 33:46.407
You know, Catherine,
you gave me a chance

33:46.475 --> 33:48.009
to walk away from all this,

33:48.077 --> 33:51.245
to choose my humanity,
to choose us...

33:51.313 --> 33:53.747
and I made the wrong decision.

33:53.815 --> 33:55.649
And it cost
Tori her life,

33:55.717 --> 33:58.185
and it almost
cost JT his,

33:58.252 --> 34:00.187
and I don't know what I would do

34:00.254 --> 34:02.022
if something happened
to you, too.

34:02.090 --> 34:05.493
Vincent, that isn't your choice.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.427
This is my story now, too.

34:07.496 --> 34:09.829
I want to figure out
how I'm connected to all this.

34:09.897 --> 34:11.931
It's part of finding out
who I am.

34:14.601 --> 34:16.536
Hey.

34:16.603 --> 34:18.338
Hey.

34:18.406 --> 34:21.708
Look, I'm going to try and
keep this as quiet as I can,

34:21.775 --> 34:23.543
but it's gonna
depend on

34:23.610 --> 34:25.378
what the other kidnap
victim's gonna say.

34:25.445 --> 34:27.346
We're taking him down
to the precinct now.

34:27.414 --> 34:28.882
Did you find out
who it is yet?

34:28.949 --> 34:30.516
No. He's pretty traumatized.

34:30.583 --> 34:32.552
I might need you
to make a statement.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.554
Yeah.

34:34.621 --> 34:36.022
Yeah, well, you know
where to find me.

34:36.089 --> 34:37.188
Okay.

34:43.862 --> 34:45.664
You want to be alone?

34:48.967 --> 34:50.902
No.

34:57.877 --> 35:00.078
I want to be with you.

35:14.427 --> 35:16.361
Look, you know,
I'm sorry that

35:16.429 --> 35:19.064
I didn't tell you before
about the beasts, it's just...

35:19.131 --> 35:20.765
Trust me, now that I know,

35:20.832 --> 35:22.867
I understand why
you didn't tell me.

35:22.935 --> 35:24.335
It's one of
those things

35:24.403 --> 35:26.043
you got to see to believe, you know?
Yeah.

35:26.105 --> 35:28.005
Does it help you,
though, at all?

35:28.074 --> 35:30.408
You know, 'cause of what
happened to your husband?

35:30.476 --> 35:33.177
Honestly, it helps more to know
that we stopped these heists

35:33.244 --> 35:35.179
and we got Barnes.

35:35.246 --> 35:36.781
If I can actually link him

35:36.848 --> 35:38.088
to Sam's murder,
all the better.

35:38.116 --> 35:40.585
Then maybe you
can move on.

35:40.652 --> 35:42.419
God forbid.

35:42.487 --> 35:44.388
It's been
six long years

35:44.456 --> 35:47.591
trying to figure out what
actually happened to Sam.

35:47.658 --> 35:50.760
I haven't even thought about
what happens next.

35:52.363 --> 35:53.930
Excuse me, Detective Vargas?
Yeah?

35:53.998 --> 35:56.266
Hi. Uh, coroner just
sent this over.

35:56.334 --> 35:58.102
Apparently, the I.D. on that
kidnapper doesn't match.

35:58.169 --> 36:00.437
What do you mean,
it doesn't match?

36:00.505 --> 36:02.439
Well, his real name's
Frank Darnell.

36:02.507 --> 36:03.873
He's got quite the rap sheet.

36:03.941 --> 36:06.042
Racketeering, wire fraud...

36:06.110 --> 36:08.078
Let me see that.
He's a con man.

36:10.615 --> 36:12.916
He's right.

36:12.984 --> 36:16.086
Looks like this guy
was just a front man

36:16.153 --> 36:17.721
for whoever
Tony Barnes really is.

36:17.788 --> 36:19.489
Where's the other victim,
the guy in the cell?

36:19.556 --> 36:20.990
He's being debriefed
downstairs.

36:21.057 --> 36:22.725
Why?

36:28.132 --> 36:30.065
Excuse me,
I need to ask you

36:30.134 --> 36:32.768
a few questions
about Tony Barnes.

36:32.836 --> 36:35.438
I'm Agent Landon, FBI.

36:36.540 --> 36:37.906
Sam?

36:37.974 --> 36:39.407
Dana.

36:39.475 --> 36:41.777
Sam, you're
still alive.

36:42.979 --> 36:45.014
Oh, my God, Sam.

36:45.081 --> 36:46.281
Is it you?

36:46.349 --> 36:48.851
Sam...
your husband, Sam?

36:55.558 --> 36:56.924
How about that, huh?

36:56.992 --> 36:59.628
Yeah, it's
incredible, really.

37:12.675 --> 37:14.275
Want to get drunk?

37:14.342 --> 37:15.609
No...
I don't know, man.

37:15.678 --> 37:17.045
Just go away.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.480
Sorry, can't.
You saved my life.

37:19.548 --> 37:21.949
It's a cultural
phenomenon, actually.

37:22.017 --> 37:23.450
Life debts.

37:23.518 --> 37:25.787
Technically,
I can only repay it

37:25.854 --> 37:27.621
by saving your life in return,

37:27.689 --> 37:29.956
but since that's probably
never gonna happen,

37:30.024 --> 37:31.458
I brought Scotch.

37:31.526 --> 37:32.726
Except I'm the reason
why your life

37:32.794 --> 37:34.074
was in danger
in the first place,

37:34.095 --> 37:35.563
which should cancel
out any credit

37:35.630 --> 37:36.830
I have for saving it.

37:36.898 --> 37:39.700
Normally true, but in this case,

37:39.767 --> 37:42.002
I am the real reason
I got kidnapped.

37:42.070 --> 37:44.337
Thought after eight
years of trying,

37:44.405 --> 37:46.073
I'd actually won
that stupid grant,

37:46.140 --> 37:48.008
so it was really
my fault.

37:48.076 --> 37:51.044
Still, Barnes used you
to get to me,

37:51.112 --> 37:52.312
so technically

37:52.379 --> 37:54.247
it is my fault.
Excuse me.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.395
But they also wanted my
beast-serum-making expertise,

37:56.417 --> 37:58.185
thank you very much.
It's not always

37:58.252 --> 37:59.586
all about you, you know.

37:59.653 --> 38:00.653
Speaking of which...

38:00.721 --> 38:02.422
did you ever figure out

38:02.489 --> 38:03.856
how to make that serum?

38:03.924 --> 38:05.692
I don't know.

38:05.759 --> 38:07.360
I never got a chance to try it.

38:07.428 --> 38:09.262
Thank God.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.930
Anyway,

38:10.997 --> 38:12.732
back to whose
fault it is...

38:12.799 --> 38:15.401
No, JT, forget it, okay?
You are wasting your time.

38:15.469 --> 38:17.002
You will never win
this argument.

38:17.070 --> 38:19.071
You have protected me
for years.

38:19.139 --> 38:21.907
At great expense, too.

38:21.975 --> 38:23.609
I mean, no way, buddy.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.745
This one is all mine.

38:27.147 --> 38:29.615
Actually, not really.

38:35.421 --> 38:37.356
Okay, here goes.

38:40.092 --> 38:42.628
So, the truth is...

38:42.695 --> 38:45.964
I'm the one who volunteered you

38:46.031 --> 38:47.932
for the Muirfield
experiment originally.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.972
Yes, me.

38:54.039 --> 38:57.441
With good intentions,
I might add,

38:57.509 --> 38:59.644
but I'm still the
one responsible

38:59.711 --> 39:01.479
for you becoming a...

39:01.546 --> 39:03.915
you know.

39:06.017 --> 39:09.453
In hopes of keeping you
safe in battle, but...

39:09.521 --> 39:12.055
obviously it didn't
work out that way.

39:15.827 --> 39:17.428
You're right, you win.

39:23.301 --> 39:26.436

39:32.310 --> 39:34.778
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

39:37.548 --> 39:40.016
So, uh...

39:40.083 --> 39:41.751
what'd you do
with the gem?

39:41.819 --> 39:42.852
I buried it.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.354
Somewhere where no one

39:44.422 --> 39:47.089
will ever find it again, I hope.

39:47.157 --> 39:49.992
I don't know, man.

39:50.060 --> 39:53.463
I'm so sorry I even
ever found that damn thing.

39:55.065 --> 39:57.099
You know, Tori--
she never did anything

39:57.167 --> 39:58.835
to deserve what
happened to her.

39:58.902 --> 40:01.470
It's not like she volunteered
for this beast serum

40:01.538 --> 40:04.106
to be injected into her;
she was born that way, you know?

40:04.174 --> 40:06.475
She just...
I don't know.

40:06.543 --> 40:10.446
She never figured out
how to live with it, I guess.

40:10.513 --> 40:12.781
Who knows?
Maybe you never can.

40:12.849 --> 40:14.015
You have.

40:16.586 --> 40:18.487
No, you have.

40:18.555 --> 40:20.288
I mean, come on.

40:20.357 --> 40:22.123
How many lives have you
saved over the years?

40:22.191 --> 40:23.359
Really.
No.

40:23.426 --> 40:25.861
That's what you do,
Vincent.

40:25.928 --> 40:28.029
That's what you are, that's
what you'll keep doing.

40:29.732 --> 40:31.132
That's a good thing.
