WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:03.897
This is Peyton's brother, Derek.

00:03.969 --> 00:06.461
Who would have guessed
Peyton's brother was a brother?

00:06.539 --> 00:09.030
- I'm your new English teacher, Mr. Chavez.
- Nick?

00:10.810 --> 00:15.270
Well, I don't know who I hate more,
Mr. Chavez.

00:15.348 --> 00:19.284
You, for being a lying bastard,
or me, for believing your crap.

00:19.819 --> 00:22.287
- I'm gonna ask you out.
- Like on a date?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.982
Just wanted to let you know.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.048
There's nothing going on
between me and Peyton.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.026
And there's nothing going on
between us, either,

00:28.094 --> 00:29.527
so why are you still here?

00:29.596 --> 00:31.257
Give me your hand.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.132
I'm gonna get her back.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.361
You can't help who you love, Peyton.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.200
- I wanna go to Duke with you.
- Oh, Haley.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.873
Daunte, I don't have your money yet.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.670
I could forget the amount.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.205
Ravens are favored to win
by 10 points tonight.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.179
I think we're a lock
to win by a lot more than that.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.182
Well, not if you want
your debt to go away.

00:52.652 --> 00:54.381
<i>The Ravens have won by nine!</i>

00:54.454 --> 00:57.218
<i>They're heading</i>
<i>to the State Championship!</i>

00:57.290 --> 00:58.484
I wanted to say thanks.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.651
I know how hard it was for you
to throw those points away.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.423
You know I'll always be there for you.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.087
But never again.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.577 --> 01:20.603
There's no reason you guys
should be here anymore. We're done.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.114
Hear that, Bear? The kid says we're done.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.343
Maybe we should leave.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.851
Look, I made sure that we won
by less than 10 points.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.148
That was the deal.

01:28.221 --> 01:32.180
Yeah. Well, I thought about it.
I think I'm gonna extend our partnership.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.492
What are you talking about?

01:34.561 --> 01:37.894
State Championship. A lot of people think
we're gonna win tomorrow night.

01:37.964 --> 01:39.864
Those people are right.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.726
No, they're not.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.030
I'm not gonna lose that game.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.438
Think about next year, Nate.

01:49.509 --> 01:52.410
You're gonna be a Duke Blue Devil,
get to play on TV.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.174
Wonder what Duke would do
if they found out

01:54.247 --> 01:58.343
that their star recruit shaved some points
in a high school basketball game.

01:59.252 --> 02:02.153
- Like anybody would believe you.
- I got proof.

02:02.222 --> 02:04.383
Your last game
was your worst game of the year.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.446
Eight turnovers?

02:05.525 --> 02:07.493
Hell, you missed three lay-ups
in the fourth quarter.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.027
I mean, even Bear
thought that was a bit much.

02:10.896 --> 02:14.094
All it takes is a whisper,
and your future's over.

02:14.534 --> 02:17.332
Would you risk your future
and the future of your pretty little wife

02:17.403 --> 02:19.394
for a meaningless trophy?

02:22.075 --> 02:24.202
Yeah. That's right.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.069
Think it over.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.639
I'm sure you'll do the right thing.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.518
"F" me.

03:26.839 --> 03:30.206
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey. Brooke, what are you doing here?

03:30.276 --> 03:32.836
I thought maybe
we could ride to school together.

03:34.447 --> 03:37.905
- You gonna invite me in?
- Yeah, yeah. Come on in.

03:38.785 --> 03:39.945
Sorry.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.285
Lucas, I miss you.

03:50.930 --> 03:54.127
Okay, I guess I thought
you were gonna say you miss me, too.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.101
Brooke, of course I miss you.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.762
I'm just a little confused.

03:58.838 --> 04:01.864
You know, you show up on my doorstep
out of the blue

04:01.941 --> 04:04.705
after ignoring me for the past month.

04:04.777 --> 04:07.143
I've just been thinking a lot
about you and us,

04:07.213 --> 04:09.408
and I thought that was enough.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.382
Brooke, I don't know.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.381
Because of Peyton?

04:16.990 --> 04:19.220
You're never gonna let that go, are you?

04:19.291 --> 04:22.784
For the last time,
Peyton and I are just friends, okay?

04:26.966 --> 04:28.490
Just friends?

04:31.471 --> 04:34.406
Well, at least you're enjoying the benefits.

04:35.708 --> 04:36.800
It...

05:26.225 --> 05:27.487
Cutting it kind of close, huh?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.221
- I overslept.
- No, you didn't.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.058
Are you forgetting?
We sleep in the same bed.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.690
Oh, well, I know one person
that's not gonna forget it anytime soon.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.097
Brooke. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.102
- That must've been really weird for you.
- It's okay.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.502
I actually have bigger news to report.

05:39.572 --> 05:42.598
They caught him.
Derek, or whatever his name is.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.041
He's in jail. It's over.

05:45.111 --> 05:48.205
- Oh, my God. Oh, that's great, Peyton.
- Thanks.

05:48.781 --> 05:51.045
Hey, look,
you can sleep in your own bed now, huh?

05:51.117 --> 05:52.379
Lucky me.

05:52.952 --> 05:57.514
Why did Brooke come over this morning,
some kind of morning-dew booty call?

05:58.057 --> 05:59.957
She said she misses me.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.995
- Do you want her to miss you?
- I don't know.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.792
Look, I know you can take care of yourself.
Just be careful, okay?

06:11.804 --> 06:13.396
What happened to you this morning?

06:13.473 --> 06:16.340
I kind of went to see Lucas.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.876
- Should have seen that coming.
- Should have seen what coming?

06:21.948 --> 06:24.508
Well, it's obvious
that you're rebounding from Nick.

06:24.584 --> 06:27.246
It's perfectly normal to wanna
re-tap an old keg after a breakup.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.551
That is not what this is about,
and I don't even like beer.

06:30.623 --> 06:33.558
I just worry that
I might have screwed up a good thing.

06:33.626 --> 06:36.390
You know, I do miss him.
What if I made a mistake?

06:36.462 --> 06:38.657
Trust me, Brooke, you didn't.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.823
How am I supposed to be sure?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.424
I mean, what if I only broke up with him
'cause I was mad at Peyton?

06:42.502 --> 06:45.528
What if you just realized
you didn't love him anymore?

06:47.673 --> 06:50.073
Okay, look, what you need to do is focus.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.601
You are organizing
tonight's basketball awards banquet.

06:53.679 --> 06:57.445
I can't wait to get out of here.
I'm so excited graduation's coming.

06:57.517 --> 06:59.075
Yeah, for some of us.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.315
Hey, don't forget that you promised
to help me decorate for the banquet today.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.652
Yeah, remind me
to quit making drunken promises.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.386
I'll meet you there after school.
I gotta deal with something.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.724
- Okay.
- Hi, Mouth. Bye, Mouth.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.195
Hey, Rachel.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.798
Gigi, hi. Didn't see you coming.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.429
- I'm sneaky like that.
- Good to know.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.733
I just wanted to tell you
that I had a great time on our date.

07:22.809 --> 07:26.040
So did I. It was definitely not boring.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.978
- Walk me to class?
- Yeah.

07:34.687 --> 07:37.417
- You wanted to see me, Coach?
- Yeah. Come on in, Nathan.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.289
Have a seat.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.588
I just wanted to tell you

07:43.663 --> 07:46.325
that you're getting
the Most Valuable Player trophy

07:46.399 --> 07:48.196
at tonight's banquet.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.636
I'd like to ask Lucas to present it to you.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.604
Okay.

07:55.675 --> 08:01.511
I also found out the alumni are giving me
some kind of a lifetime achievement thing.

08:01.581 --> 08:04.015
Coach, that's great. You deserve it.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.881
I don't know. Lifetime achievement?

08:06.953 --> 08:09.285
Sounds like an obituary to me.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.382
It still hasn't sunk in

08:15.061 --> 08:18.792
that tomorrow night's game
is the last one I'll ever coach.

08:21.901 --> 08:22.993
Yeah.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.535
Can you keep a secret?

08:28.007 --> 08:30.601
I really want this championship.

08:35.147 --> 08:39.481
Here, take Mr. Kelly's English quiz
down to the tutor center and file it.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.316
Then bring me back my key, okay? Thanks.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.148
Miss Gatina?

08:45.224 --> 08:47.249
A little early for you to be at school,
isn't it?

08:47.326 --> 08:49.294
Kind of. Quick question.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.195
If someone was failing calculus
this late in the year,

08:52.265 --> 08:53.789
what would that mean?

08:53.866 --> 08:56.699
Well, calculus is a part of
the school's core curriculum.

08:56.769 --> 09:00.967
So if one were to fail it, that student
would not graduate with their class.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.133
That's what I thought. Thanks.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.643
Can I give you some advice, Rachel?

09:06.479 --> 09:09.312
It's no secret you flirt your way
through high school.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.180
You're a pretty girl,
and you can bluff a lot of people.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.242
But you can't bluff math.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.755
Study for your final, okay?

09:16.822 --> 09:19.154
And graduate with your friends.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.453
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.961
You know, some people actually eat lunch
during their lunch break.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.438
Well, good for them.
Unfortunately, we need money.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.101
I just figured I'd pick up
a few extra shifts at the café.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.940
It might give us some
extra breathing room. Check this out.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.445
- What is this?
- Breathing room.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.948
- You made all this today?
- Yeah, on one table.

09:44.016 --> 09:47.474
That's them leaving now.
Hey, guys! Please come again.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.753
Count on it.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.985
- Hey, I'll see you back at school.
- Okay.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.251
- Bye.
- See you.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.264
Hey!

10:06.205 --> 10:07.297
This is over.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.637
Stay away from me,
stay away from my wife,

10:09.709 --> 10:11.233
and forget about
the State Championships.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.538
It's not gonna happen.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.410
You can tell Duke whatever you want.
Now we're done.

10:15.481 --> 10:18.644
You really think
all we're gonna do is tell Duke?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.220
- Come here!
- What? No!

10:22.788 --> 10:24.847
You want to mess around?

10:24.924 --> 10:26.391
Hold his leg up.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.892
Wait! No!

10:29.428 --> 10:30.588
- Come here!
- No!

10:30.663 --> 10:32.995
Say goodbye to basketball.
You won't play anywhere.

10:33.065 --> 10:35.397
Hell, you'll be lucky to walk again.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.993
- It didn't have to come to this.
- No!

10:46.746 --> 10:48.839
Here's my final tip to you.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.473
Lose that game.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.572
You sure about the color?

11:18.744 --> 11:21.406
Because this is starting
to look like that scene in <i>The Shining</i>

11:21.480 --> 11:23.345
with those creepy little twins.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.546
Oh, am I boring you?

11:26.619 --> 11:28.712
Just say the word,
and I can stop painting your room.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.346
I'm sorry.

11:30.423 --> 11:34.257
I'm just dealing
with some stupid high school boy drama.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.124
- Lucas, huh?
- Is it that obvious?

11:37.196 --> 11:40.131
- Only to everyone.
- Everyone except Lucas.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.325
So make it obvious to him.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.233
I don't understand
why you're so afraid of your own feelings.

11:44.303 --> 11:47.932
Well, those feelings are what destroyed
my friendship with Brooke,

11:48.007 --> 11:49.872
and I don't want to lose Lucas, too.

11:49.942 --> 11:52.877
What have I been trying to teach you?
You can't live in fear.

11:52.945 --> 11:55.106
Life is about taking risks,

11:55.181 --> 11:57.172
not being afraid
to go after what you want.

11:57.249 --> 12:00.013
I'm just not sure this is the right time.

12:00.086 --> 12:03.055
It never is. That's why it's called a risk.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.257
You got that banquet tonight.
Ask him to go with you.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.384
Maybe I should.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.798
Well, look, I gotta get back to school.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.163
But the room really is
looking so much better.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.292
Tell you what.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.893
I'll promise to have this room done
by the time you get home

12:18.971 --> 12:21.496
if you promise to take a risk today.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.132
Deal?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.070
Okay. Deal.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.476
All right.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.277
No fear.

12:38.657 --> 12:39.681
Hey, Nate.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.852
Luke, not now, okay? I'm not in the mood.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.488
Look, Whitey asked me to present you
with the MVP award at tonight's banquet.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.498
Well, if you have a problem with that,
then just say no.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.194
No, I'll do it, but before I do,

12:50.269 --> 12:52.794
I need to know
if I'm presenting Nathan Scott, the MVP,

12:52.872 --> 12:55.306
or Nathan Scott, the point-shaver.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.337
Lucas, I don't need another lecture, okay?

12:59.411 --> 13:01.504
I didn't ask you to miss those free throws.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.878
If you don't want to give me
the stupid award, then just don't.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.383
You told me this was over, Nathan.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.579
Just promise me that it is.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.396
Peyton, I brought you something.
Thought you could use it.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.706
Am I missing something?

13:29.775 --> 13:32.903
It's a to-go box, you know,
since you're screwing my leftovers.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.468
Really, Brooke?

13:34.547 --> 13:39.075
You seriously went through the trouble
of bringing me an actual to-go box?

13:39.819 --> 13:43.846
- At least you're a dedicated bitch.
- Says the dedicated slut.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.653
For the record, I'm not screwing Lucas.

13:47.626 --> 13:48.923
I know you have trouble comprehending

13:48.994 --> 13:51.485
two people in bed together
actually just sleeping.

13:51.564 --> 13:55.227
Remember, Peyton, I gave Lucas to you,
and I can take him back whenever I want.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.202
Brooke, are you listening to yourself?

13:58.270 --> 14:02.331
If you decide to get back with Lucas,
you better mean it,

14:02.408 --> 14:04.467
'cause he deserves to be
with somebody who loves him.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.170
Someone like you?

14:13.719 --> 14:16.017
Luke, can I talk to you?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.055
Well, that depends.
You gonna bite my head off?

14:19.124 --> 14:23.117
Sounds like fun, but there's probably
too many people around for that.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.426
- Look, about this morning...
- Listen, you don't have to explain.

14:26.498 --> 14:28.523
It's none of my business.
I shouldn't have interrupted.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.092
Well, you weren't interrupting anything.

14:31.170 --> 14:34.628
Peyton's been sleeping over 'cause
that crazy stalker guy's been missing.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.335
But they finally caught him,
so she's safe now.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.845
- So she won't be sleeping over anymore?
- No.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.075
But even if she was, you know,
why would you care?

14:44.149 --> 14:47.414
Luke, the reason
that I came over this morning

14:47.486 --> 14:50.922
was to ask if you wanted to go
to the banquet with me.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.856
- You mean, like a date?
- Or as friends.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.356
We should be able to be friends, right?

14:57.429 --> 15:01.195
Yeah, I kind of remember
asking you that same question once.

15:01.767 --> 15:05.897
And you were right, okay?
I know that now. So what do you say?

15:08.841 --> 15:11.742
Yeah. I'll go to the banquet with you.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.410
Okay. I'll see you later, then.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.313
In case you were wondering,

15:22.388 --> 15:25.516
the nurse's office is still the best place
to treat a venereal disease.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.615
That's good to know.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.752
Actually, I was looking for you.
I need you to tutor me.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.490
Oh, God, she's serious.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.089
I'm failing calculus, and if I don't pass,

15:35.167 --> 15:36.964
I won't be able to graduate
with my friends.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.527
Remind me who your friends are again.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.698
Look, Haley,
I know we've had our differences...

15:41.774 --> 15:43.139
You think?

15:43.742 --> 15:46.506
I've seen what you can do with some
of those brain-dead losers at our school,

15:46.578 --> 15:47.704
and I'm actually smart.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.977
I've just skipped too many classes,
and I can't catch up on my own.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.540
Well, if you're really committed to this,

15:52.618 --> 15:54.950
I will be happy to recommend
another tutor to you.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.454
But I can't help you personally.
It's not possible.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.388
Oh, I figured you'd be all booked up.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.894
No, no. I have plenty of time.
I just can't stand you.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.665
Five visits in one week.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.798
I think you've just become
my most loyal customer.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.239
What can I get you?

16:17.309 --> 16:20.710
Actually, I came by to see if you were
going to the awards banquet tonight.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.747
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.017
Well, in that case,
how about we go together?

16:26.418 --> 16:29.546
Not as a date, just two people
attending the same event,

16:29.621 --> 16:33.318
riding in the same car,
possibly sitting at the same table.

16:35.094 --> 16:39.895
Look, Dan, I appreciate everything
that you've done for me lately, but I can't.

16:42.034 --> 16:45.265
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand. I'll see you there.

16:50.042 --> 16:53.239
Hey, Sawyer.
Thanks for ditching me at lunch.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.075
Sorry. Derek's repainting my room.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.081
I figured the least I could do
is keep him company.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.344
You two are getting pretty close, huh?

16:59.418 --> 17:02.080
I guess so. He's still annoying as hell.

17:02.154 --> 17:03.883
Seems to have an opinion
about everything.

17:03.956 --> 17:07.357
- Remind you of anyone?
- Lf you mean you, then yes.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.219
So, look, I was wondering,

17:11.896 --> 17:15.458
do you want to go to the banquet tonight,
like, together?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.394
I'd love to, Peyton.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.902
But I know that
there's some weirdness going on

17:21.973 --> 17:23.805
between you and Brooke right now.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.503
What does that have to do
with us going to the banquet together?

17:26.578 --> 17:29.945
- I already told Brooke I'd go with her.
- Oh.

17:30.616 --> 17:34.643
I feel bad. I mean, it'd just be great
if we could all go together, you know?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.314
No, no, it's cool.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.290
Really, it's not a big deal.
I just didn't know you two...

17:40.359 --> 17:44.921
No, no, no. I don't know if we are.
I mean, I guess I'll find out tonight.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.424
Wish me luck.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.876
Look at this thing. These are ugly.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.846
Yeah, they're pretty ugly. Who cares?

18:07.920 --> 18:11.754
I do. I don't want tacky flowers
sucking the energy out of the room.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.554
Why are you so concerned
about this stupid banquet?

18:14.626 --> 18:17.117
'Cause I asked Lucas to go with me.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.561
Brooke, what are you thinking?

18:18.630 --> 18:21.428
Go sleep with him if you're horny.
Don't go to the banquet with him.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.594
- What you're feeling isn't real.
- Well, maybe you're wrong.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.262
These are wrong.

18:27.072 --> 18:31.304
You know what this means, don't you?
You have a date for tonight and I don't.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.474
Well, you may not have a date,

18:33.545 --> 18:36.173
but you have a seating chart
you can help me with.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.008
Well, you've got a problem.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.451
Do you realize
who you have sitting at this table?

18:42.521 --> 18:44.819
I know exactly
who I have sitting at that table.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.586
- Then we are in for a fun night.
- Yeah.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.249
Hey.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.558
Oh, Mouth, I need you
to be my date for the banquet tonight.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.064
I'll pick you up at 6:00,
and don't wear the Drakkar.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.158
Sorry, Rachel, I'm going with Gigi.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.260
In fact, I better go home and get ready.

18:58.337 --> 19:02.603
But the room looks really great, you guys.
Those flowers are awesome.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.610
Okay, we are losing the flowers.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.203
And it looks like you're going solo. Sorry.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.108
Or not.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.345
Hello?

19:15.921 --> 19:17.445
Yes, sir.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.388
Yes, sir. I understand.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.622
Yes, sir.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.293
Yes, sir.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.868
Are you kidding me?

19:32.938 --> 19:36.237
This place looks great!
I can't believe you finished.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.105
Just holding up my end of the bargain.

19:38.177 --> 19:42.045
- Question is, did you?
- Yeah. I took a risk.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.447
Are you gonna leave me hanging?

19:45.851 --> 19:48.445
He's going to the banquet with Brooke.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.815
I'm sorry, Peyton.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.585
At least you put yourself out there.
I'm proud of you.

19:53.659 --> 19:54.853
Thanks.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.558
So I kind of need a favor.

19:58.931 --> 20:02.458
Will you go with me? And I'm not sure
I can handle another "no."

20:02.901 --> 20:04.391
I'd be honored to.

20:05.404 --> 20:06.530
Cool.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.573
You got a special place for this?

20:11.877 --> 20:15.142
I used to. I don't think I need it anymore.

20:19.084 --> 20:20.210
- Hey.
- Hey!

20:20.285 --> 20:23.186
I heard you're presenting Nathan
with the MVP award tonight.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.415
That's awesome. Do you need a ride?

20:24.489 --> 20:25.956
We can swing by
and pick you up on the way.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.891
Actually, I'm going with Brooke.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.293
Rewind. When did this happen?

20:32.364 --> 20:33.729
She asked me today.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.029
- Are you back together?
- You guys think I'm crazy.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.092
- No, I...
- I don't think you're crazy, Luke.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.037
I mean, maybe Brooke thinks
she's made a mistake.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.006
Everybody deserves a second chance.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.475
I agree.
I think you guys were good together.

20:45.544 --> 20:49.878
Oh, hey, Rachel asked me to tutor her.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.678
- You're tutoring Rachel?
- Hell, no. I said she asked me.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.912
Wait, wait, wait.
What happened to second chances?

20:54.987 --> 20:56.614
Rachel's had plenty of second chances,

20:56.688 --> 20:58.383
and every time
she's proven her true colors.

20:58.457 --> 20:59.788
I'm just saying.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.052
Look, people make mistakes,

21:01.126 --> 21:02.889
but if they're willing
to put the past behind them,

21:02.961 --> 21:04.986
then maybe we should, too.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.630
Right, Mom?

21:09.901 --> 21:11.061
Right.

21:13.071 --> 21:14.231
Right.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.782
It's not a date.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.433
Wow! <i>Déjà vu.</i>

21:44.503 --> 21:46.596
Dan Scott and Karen Roe, together again.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.401
I hear you're pregnant, too.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.169
It is just like our high school prom.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.571
Shari, is your son Tim
even on the basketball team anymore?

21:54.646 --> 21:56.739
Actually, Timmy is doing really well.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.807
He's at a private institution
that focuses specifically

21:59.885 --> 22:02.353
on each student's strengths
and weaknesses.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.446
Just say he's slow, Shari.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.470
Rachel, are we at the same table?

22:24.409 --> 22:25.671
Sort of.

22:25.744 --> 22:29.612
I think there's been a mistake.
Where's Gigi supposed to sit?

22:31.450 --> 22:33.179
Oh, Gigi, I'm sorry.

22:33.251 --> 22:36.379
You were a last-minute add,
so I had to seat you at another table.

22:36.455 --> 22:40.186
That's okay, 'cause now I've got
the best seat in the house.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.728
Let me get you a chair.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.763
We're at table five.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.948
No fear.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.636
Everyone,
for those of you who don't know,

23:29.708 --> 23:33.041
this is my brother, Derek, the real one.

23:33.111 --> 23:34.373
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

23:34.446 --> 23:35.879
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you, buddy.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.642
Hey. Nice to meet you.

23:37.716 --> 23:38.740
- What's up?
- Hey.

23:38.817 --> 23:39.875
Hey.

23:41.987 --> 23:46.083
So, guys, is Tree Hill gonna win
the State Championship this year?

23:46.158 --> 23:49.525
I don't know.
Hey, Nathan, are we gonna win tomorrow?

23:51.663 --> 23:53.255
We're gonna try.

23:58.036 --> 24:00.061
Anybody else need a drink?

24:05.911 --> 24:08.436
Well, he seems nice. Derek.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.871
Yeah, he's a good guy.

24:10.949 --> 24:14.316
- You should really get to know him.
- What's the point?

24:14.386 --> 24:16.877
Besides, tonight's about us, right?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.957
How's Haley doing?

24:26.798 --> 24:29.767
She's grown into a strong woman.

24:30.502 --> 24:33.096
I can't believe she's gonna be a mom.

24:33.438 --> 24:35.099
It seems like yesterday
that she was coming

24:35.173 --> 24:37.835
and asking Lucas to come out and play.

24:38.443 --> 24:41.173
You know, they're definitely young,

24:41.246 --> 24:43.714
but at least they have each other.

24:43.782 --> 24:46.250
Nathan's gonna be a great father.

24:50.422 --> 24:53.482
Karen, I realize you have no regrets,
but I do.

24:54.926 --> 24:57.121
I just need you to know that.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.493
<i>Good evening, everybody.</i>

25:06.571 --> 25:09.096
<i>Tonight I've been asked to present</i>

25:09.174 --> 25:12.473
<i>a very important award</i>
<i>to a very important person.</i>

25:13.445 --> 25:17.040
<i>The Most Valuable Player award honors</i>
<i>not only the best player on the court,</i>

25:17.115 --> 25:19.583
<i>but also a true leader off the court.</i>

25:19.651 --> 25:23.883
<i>An MVPleads a team</i>
<i>not only in points or rebounds,</i>

25:23.955 --> 25:25.479
<i>but also leads by example.</i>

25:25.557 --> 25:29.618
<i>And we are very proud</i>
<i>to follow in the footsteps of our leader</i>

25:29.694 --> 25:33.255
<i>and our most valuable player,</i>
<i>Nathan Scott.</i>

25:45.176 --> 25:47.144
You're our leader, Nate.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.053
<i>I'm not very good at speeches,</i>

25:57.122 --> 26:00.649
<i>so I just wanted</i>
<i>to thank my teammates, guys,</i>

26:00.725 --> 26:03.216
<i>and, most of all, Coach Whitey Durham</i>

26:03.295 --> 26:05.957
<i>for giving me a year</i>
<i>that I'll always remember.</i>

26:06.031 --> 26:08.727
<i>Thanks, Coach. Appreciate it.</i>

26:08.800 --> 26:09.926
<i>Thanks.</i>

26:24.282 --> 26:26.307
- Hey, proud wifey.
- Hi.

26:27.619 --> 26:30.383
Did Nathan look nervous to you at all?

26:30.455 --> 26:33.982
Well, he looked like the star
of the basketball team.

26:34.059 --> 26:36.289
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah.

26:37.028 --> 26:39.724
Okay. Rachel told me
she asked you for tutoring help

26:39.798 --> 26:40.822
and you turned her down.

26:40.899 --> 26:43.333
Yeah. Can you blame me?
She's been hitting on Nathan for a month.

26:43.401 --> 26:46.370
I know. I know. She has flaws, big ones.

26:46.438 --> 26:50.306
But, deep down, I promise you
she's a really good person.

26:50.375 --> 26:53.071
Oh, my God, you and Lucas
with your second chances.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.078
- I cannot help her!
- Okay.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.137
I'm not saying you have to tutor her.

26:57.215 --> 27:00.514
I'm just saying
she's been really good to me lately.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.054
So think about it, okay?

27:14.532 --> 27:18.093
- Hey, Private, you hanging in there?
- Trying my best.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.532
Thanks for coming with me tonight.

27:23.608 --> 27:26.668
Without you,
I would have left a long time ago.

27:26.745 --> 27:29.339
Peyton, I need to tell you something.

27:30.615 --> 27:33.914
- My unit is deploying in 24 hours.
- Deploying?

27:35.086 --> 27:37.611
I take it that's Marine for "you're leaving"?

27:37.689 --> 27:39.554
I leave for assignment tomorrow.

27:39.624 --> 27:40.750
How long have you known?

27:40.825 --> 27:44.124
I got the call today.
I was waiting for the right time to tell you.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.459
I'm supposed to be back
at the base by now.

27:46.531 --> 27:49.898
- Why aren't you?
- Because my little sister needed me.

27:54.105 --> 27:57.199
I guess I should have let you
hang that drawing.

28:01.346 --> 28:06.340
<i>As most of you know, tomorrow night</i>
<i>is Coach Whitey Durham 's final game.</i>

28:06.418 --> 28:10.684
<i>And to show our appreciation</i>
<i>for his dedication and excellence,</i>

28:10.755 --> 28:13.815
<i>we present him tonight</i>
<i>with a lifetime achievement award.</i>

28:13.892 --> 28:18.226
<i>So, without further ado,</i>
<i>I give you your coach, Whitey Durham.</i>

28:38.116 --> 28:41.051
<i>You do realize</i>
<i>we have one more game to play?</i>

28:42.620 --> 28:46.522
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>this award means an awful lot to me.</i>

28:48.727 --> 28:51.662
<i>I might have given a lifetime to this team,</i>

28:52.764 --> 28:57.792
<i>but the players,</i>
<i>the players have given me so much more.</i>

28:58.803 --> 29:02.796
<i>You know, basketball was my first love.</i>

29:04.075 --> 29:06.566
<i>And, as most of you in here realize,</i>

29:07.512 --> 29:09.946
<i>you don't forget your first love.</i>

29:12.317 --> 29:17.311
<i>My only regret is that</i>
<i>I can't share this wonderful moment</i>

29:17.388 --> 29:20.824
<i>with the other love of my life,</i>

29:22.227 --> 29:25.594
<i>my late wife, Camilla.</i>

29:28.399 --> 29:32.859
<i>Camilla was the only person</i>
<i>who ever fully understood me.</i>

29:32.937 --> 29:36.873
<i>Being with her made everything else</i>
<i>seem less important.</i>

29:37.742 --> 29:43.942
<i>The moment I met her,</i>
<i>I knew that I was looking at my future.</i>

29:45.049 --> 29:51.215
<i>And I knew no person</i>
<i>could ever come between us.</i>

29:52.891 --> 29:56.156
<i>I know Camilla would have liked</i>
<i>this group of boys.</i>

30:00.365 --> 30:02.162
<i>I want to thank them,</i>

30:03.001 --> 30:05.231
<i>and I want to thank all of you</i>

30:06.037 --> 30:10.667
<i>for allowing me to spend a lifetime</i>

30:11.743 --> 30:13.472
<i>with my first love.</i>

30:15.914 --> 30:17.245
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:27.625 --> 30:29.752
Hey, Dad, I need to talk to you.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.193
Excuse me.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.334
I'm in trouble, Dad.

30:40.405 --> 30:43.340
- How bad is it?
- Bad enough that I need you.

30:45.643 --> 30:49.807
I borrowed some money from these guys
and I couldn't pay them back,

30:50.448 --> 30:53.975
so they asked me
to shave a few points in the last game.

30:54.919 --> 30:56.910
Tell me you didn't do it.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.880
- How could you be so stupid?
- I came to you for help!

31:00.959 --> 31:04.326
I needed you, and you said no!
I didn't have a choice!

31:04.395 --> 31:08.627
And now they want me to throw
the State Championship tomorrow night.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.770
You gotta help me, Dad.

31:17.809 --> 31:21.074
- Tell me their names.
- Daunte and Bear.

31:22.146 --> 31:23.738
Damn it, Nathan.

31:26.517 --> 31:29.247
Go back inside. I'll take care of this.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.554
Dad,

31:39.197 --> 31:40.528
I'm sorry.

31:55.647 --> 31:59.208
I'm sorry, Karen.
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.412
That's okay. I can find another ride home.

32:01.486 --> 32:04.080
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

32:04.155 --> 32:06.851
It's not like this was a date
or anything, remember?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.415
If you say so.

32:24.042 --> 32:26.067
I just have one question.

32:26.978 --> 32:28.536
What, no props?

32:28.613 --> 32:32.105
If you're sleeping in Lucas' bed,
why haven't you told him how you feel?

32:32.183 --> 32:34.276
Brooke, I told you
I was not gonna say anything to Lucas

32:34.352 --> 32:36.081
until it was over between the two of you.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.553
And so, yes, if you had moved on,

32:37.622 --> 32:40.853
then I probably would have
said something by now,

32:41.326 --> 32:44.159
but you haven't dated anybody
since Lucas.

32:44.529 --> 32:47.293
You had your chance, Peyton.
You should have said something.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.731
It doesn't matter now, does it?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.031
Looks like the two of you
are getting back together.

32:52.103 --> 32:55.766
I was mad at you when I asked him
to come with me tonight.

32:56.240 --> 33:00.336
- So you invited him out of spite?
- No, not at first.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.771
Now I don't know anymore.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.095
Mayor Dan Scott.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.232
Are we sitting at your table, Danny?

33:32.844 --> 33:35.404
I understand you've had
a little misunderstanding with my son.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.175
Now, we're all businessmen,

33:37.248 --> 33:40.706
so how much is it gonna take
to make this all go away?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.887
Take a hike, bitches.

33:46.424 --> 33:47.618
Daunte?

33:53.131 --> 33:55.156
All right. Go on. Go on.

33:57.268 --> 33:59.736
Let me ask you a question, Mr. Mayor.

33:59.804 --> 34:01.169
Where the hell do you think you are?

34:01.239 --> 34:03.207
You think you can settle this
with a checkbook?

34:03.274 --> 34:05.105
Not unless you're prepared
to write a check for all the money

34:05.176 --> 34:09.373
that the gamblers stand to win
tomorrow night when your son loses.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.347
Or, rather, your sons.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.844
You don't scare me.
You're just a couple of punks.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.217
Now, this is what's gonna happen.

34:17.288 --> 34:19.949
You stay away from my son,
whether I give you money or not.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.786
Do you understand?

34:24.094 --> 34:27.757
It's awful comforting having
so many people close to you, isn't it?

34:27.831 --> 34:31.097
For example, your ex-wife,
your cute little daughter-in-law...

34:31.168 --> 34:32.362
A couple sons.

34:32.437 --> 34:35.531
Oh, and let's not forget Karen Roe
and her baby.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.806
Be an awful shame
if the ground next to your brother Keith

34:39.877 --> 34:42.902
started getting real crowded,
don't you think?

34:44.982 --> 34:47.246
Here's a tip for you, Mr. Mayor.

34:47.318 --> 34:51.277
Bet against the Ravens tomorrow night.
Make yourself some money.

34:53.357 --> 34:55.382
Get the hell out of here.

35:17.081 --> 35:19.072
I'm so proud of you.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.778
God, I wish people would stop saying that.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.818
Why?

35:23.888 --> 35:26.823
What is going on with you?
You've been so distant all day.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.826
- Is it the game?
- No. I'm fine.

35:29.894 --> 35:33.261
I'm just...
I'm feeling a lot of pressure lately, I guess.

35:33.331 --> 35:34.662
I'm sorry.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.829
Yeah, you know what?

35:37.135 --> 35:41.231
For the first time in a while,
I think everything's gonna be okay.

35:42.006 --> 35:43.098
Good.

35:44.775 --> 35:49.212
- So I gotta ask your advice on something.
- All right.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.978
Rachel asked me to tutor her.

35:54.218 --> 35:55.242
Wow.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.254
And I just wanted to know
what you thought I should do.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.183
Well, I remember not too long ago
I needed a tutor,

36:02.260 --> 36:05.354
and you set aside your feelings
and agreed to help me.

36:05.429 --> 36:07.761
Do not compare yourself to Rachel.

36:07.832 --> 36:11.199
Well, we all make mistakes, all of us.

36:12.403 --> 36:13.734
Look, you do what you wanna do.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.328
But I think you should know that,

36:15.406 --> 36:17.897
when I was freaking out
about the whole pregnancy thing,

36:17.975 --> 36:20.910
Rachel was the one
that got through to me.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.206
Oh, God.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.209
I'm gonna have to tutor Rachel, aren't I?

36:25.283 --> 36:26.750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:33.558 --> 36:36.356
I better get back to the base
before they think I went AWOL.

36:36.427 --> 36:37.416
Oh.

36:38.262 --> 36:40.822
I'll drop you off on the way.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.662
It's actually a really beautiful night.
I was thinking maybe I'd walk.

36:43.734 --> 36:47.465
- You sure you want to do that?
- "No fear," right?

36:48.739 --> 36:53.176
I haven't walked by myself since
Psycho Derek disappeared. The other one.

36:54.645 --> 36:56.613
It'd be nice to walk home by myself.

36:56.681 --> 36:59.548
Peyton Sawyer, wanting to be alone.

37:00.818 --> 37:02.877
Look how far you've come.

37:04.021 --> 37:05.784
It's because of you.

37:09.126 --> 37:12.960
So I'm kind of a pro at this next part,
the "goodbye" part.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.362
"People always leave," remember?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.561
You'll be careful, right?

37:23.341 --> 37:27.539
Don't worry about me.
I won't go trying to be a hero or anything.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.136
Sure you will.

37:31.616 --> 37:32.947
Come here.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.417
I'll be back, Peyton.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.780
I believe you.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.387
Thanks.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.322
Lucas, don't hate me, okay?

38:15.393 --> 38:17.953
But I think that this was a mistake.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.058
So do I.

38:21.732 --> 38:24.064
- You do?
- I...

38:25.469 --> 38:29.200
I missed you so much
when you broke up with me, Brooke.

38:29.273 --> 38:33.403
I mean, I spent every day hoping
that maybe we'd get back together.

38:34.278 --> 38:39.716
But listening to Whitey
describe his life with Camilla,

38:39.784 --> 38:42.753
- I just realized...
- He wasn't describing us.

38:48.092 --> 38:50.720
- Do you think that even exists anymore?
- What?

38:50.795 --> 38:54.094
A love so strong
that no person can come between it.

38:56.534 --> 38:58.058
I sure hope so.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.231
Yeah.

39:01.205 --> 39:03.901
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

39:06.944 --> 39:09.071
So where does this leave us?

39:10.581 --> 39:11.809
Friends?

39:15.219 --> 39:16.447
Friends.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.069
- Rachel?
- Haley.

39:35.139 --> 39:38.040
Look, I will tutor you on three conditions.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.475
The first one is that you have to work
around my schedule.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.704
I'm working a ton of hours right now,

39:41.779 --> 39:43.804
and I really don't care
if it disrupts your social life.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.679
The second is,
if you miss one session, it's over.

39:46.751 --> 39:48.241
- Got it?
- Got it.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.549
So what's the third condition?

39:51.689 --> 39:56.285
No matter how nice I seem,
you have to remember

39:57.027 --> 39:59.359
that I can't stand you.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.423
Okay?

40:33.864 --> 40:36.059
- Did you talk to them?
- Yeah.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.327
What are we gonna do, Dad?

40:41.672 --> 40:44.505
You're gonna lose
the State Championship.

41:05.663 --> 41:07.358
Now, this is more like it.

41:07.431 --> 41:09.296
Listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry

41:09.366 --> 41:12.858
that we didn't get to spend
more time together tonight.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.195
How'd it go with Brooke?

41:15.272 --> 41:18.332
I realized tonight
that it's over between me and Brooke.

41:18.409 --> 41:20.934
And she realized it, too.

41:27.718 --> 41:29.379
I love you, Lucas.

41:30.721 --> 41:32.985
I love you, too, Peyton.

41:33.057 --> 41:34.888
You don't understand.

41:35.793 --> 41:38.591
I've been holding this in
for a really long time,

41:38.662 --> 41:40.721
and you just need to know.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.165
I love you.

41:44.602 --> 41:46.399
I'm in love with you.

42:26.844 --> 42:27.833
