WEBVTT

01:01.360 --> 01:02.960
Christ be my salvation.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.440
They say that a man is never so weak,

01:09.440 --> 01:11.320
so defenceless against suffering

01:11.320 --> 01:13.480
as when he is in love.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.960
Love is still an enigma to science.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.240
Perhaps it is just a state of madness.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.960
I was told this legend as a child.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.040
Human beings were once
double-headed creatures.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.640
The Gods resolved that
we should all be humbled.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.640
They devised a punishment
- cutting each body in half.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.840
Now, every person is looking
for their missing counterpart.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.680
Every one of us has a
perfect pre-ordained love.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.800
The other self that
the Gods took from us.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.600
Josefine! What?

01:55.600 --> 01:59.680
He's here again. He's waiting.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.080
Thank you for inviting me.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.720
Well, it wouldn't be a proper
party without you. For you.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.560
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.720
Two years, four months and one week.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.920
Max doesn't believe in
making snap decisions.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.960
No, he does not.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.960
You are a lucky fellow.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.800
Yes, I know. Clara keeps reminding me.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.840
We're thinking June, most likely.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.440
June?

02:43.440 --> 02:46.160
Gives you time to get used to the idea.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.160
Gives her time to purchase
several different dresses.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.840
Speech time, I'm afraid.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.400
Max.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.080
My dear friends,
it gives us great pleasure

03:01.080 --> 03:03.240
to welcome you here to this ceremony.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.520
Clara, I know that your father

03:05.520 --> 03:07.840
would have been filled
with immense joy to see you

03:07.840 --> 03:10.600
betrothed here today.
I'm only sorry we couldn't find you

03:10.600 --> 03:13.480
a better husband than my son to marry.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.120
Still, there are enough
mad people in the city

03:16.120 --> 03:18.480
to keep him gainfully employed.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.400
And now, eat, drink,
enjoy. Music, please.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.480
My Max.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.760
My nephew is growing so fast.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.080
No wonder, when you see
how much he eats. Ah.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.160
Inspector! Inspector.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.200
I'm sorry. There's been an incident.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.920
What is it?

03:47.920 --> 03:50.880
A murder in Spittelberg.
Everyone's looking for you.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.360
Is something wrong, Max?

03:52.360 --> 03:54.760
Er, yes, the Inspector has to leave.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.600
Forgive me, Herr Liebermann.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.520
Doctor. Good evening.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.000
He might have taken his hat off.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.000
You want to go with him.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.839
No. No.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.440
The party was over anyway.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.200
Thank you.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.480
Inspector!

04:39.480 --> 04:41.080
You don't mind my joining you?

04:41.080 --> 04:42.640
Thank you.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.040
I was just inches from a clean getaway.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.600
Are you coming?

05:19.680 --> 05:21.080
Rheinhardt!

05:21.080 --> 05:23.040
What the hell are you doing here?

05:23.040 --> 05:26.000
I'm taking charge. It's my case.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.400
Nobody could find you.
So they called me at home.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.480
Now, excuse me, I'm very busy.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.840
Haussman.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.360
Looks like a wild
animal got hold of them.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.760
Look, in here
- there is another one.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.400
Different from the others.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.600
All killed by the same weapon
- a long blade.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.600
Something with a very distinct curve.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.720
Herr Doctor.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.400
Make your report to me.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.760
Maybe a butchering tool,

06:57.760 --> 07:00.280
or a tanner's instrument.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.360
Hmm.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.760
What about her?

07:04.960 --> 07:07.160
Just as brutal.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.080
But he cleaned up the mess.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.640
Washed her body.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.560
Dr Liebermann?

07:17.200 --> 07:18.880
The attack was frenzied.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.880
But then, the way he
laid out the final victim,

07:23.880 --> 07:25.160
he became almost...

07:27.200 --> 07:29.160
..I don't know
- almost loving.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.720
These other women are
incidental, but her...

07:34.720 --> 07:36.600
She was the one he wanted.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.520
Almost a shrine he built to her.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.640
I think he would have come here before.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.840
Visited her when she was alive.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.040
Have you interviewed any clients?

07:50.040 --> 07:51.360
Obviously.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.760
Any clients who came in regularly?

07:57.080 --> 08:00.520
One name... keeps cropping up.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.360
Don't worry, son!
They've made a mistake!

08:28.720 --> 08:30.720
I don't need both of you on the case.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.159
Sir, if I may remind you that...

08:32.159 --> 08:34.799
Ah, I see Dr Liebermann
is consulting again.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.600
Well, I suppose after
your success together

08:43.600 --> 08:45.360
in Leopoldstadt...

08:45.360 --> 08:47.600
Your lucky charm, Rheinhardt.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.880
Very well.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.040
Do you understand why you are here?

09:08.920 --> 09:10.880
This is a murder investigation.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.000
Four women were killed near here -

09:20.000 --> 09:22.040
at Borek's brothel, in the old town.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.680
You've been there a dozen times
in the last few weeks alone.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.080
And always the same woman
- Josefine.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.800
You remember her?
Easy to become attached.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.640
All that time you spent in her company.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.360
Easy, when you've paid a fee
to feel a sense of possession.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.760
Sir? There's someone here to see you.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.200
You've got no business keeping him here!

09:58.200 --> 10:00.280
Your son is a suspect in
a murder investigation.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.920
You don't know him!
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.840
Hard to establish his innocence
if he won't say anything.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.720
He is not right in his head
- never has been.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.520
Got the brain of a little child.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.280
You know he visits Borek's. The brothel.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.040
What else is he going to do?

10:15.040 --> 10:18.600
No respectable woman would
ever look at him twice!

10:18.600 --> 10:20.880
It's about that girl, isn't it?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.440
She was kind to him once.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.560
Kind?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.160
He was injured in the street.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.880
Set upon by a gang.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.320
She stepped in and rescued him.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.640
After that he kept
wanting to go and meet her.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.480
She bled him dry,
all his money is spent there!

10:40.840 --> 10:42.400
They never do anything!

10:42.400 --> 10:45.080
He just sits there and admires her.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.160
Oh?

10:47.920 --> 10:50.440
Are you telling me he
never laid a finger on her?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.160
Your son, he was baptised a Catholic?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.920
What's that got to do with anything?

10:59.160 --> 11:01.120
He keeps grabbing at his neck.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.760
Did he wear a chain?

11:04.440 --> 11:08.480
The girl... Something
was found in her fingers.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.280
Oh...!

11:24.920 --> 11:26.720
Sweet Jesus.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.800
You're late back.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.200
Mmm. She insisted on waiting.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.280
Poor girl. She's too sweet-natured.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.920
I'll order her carriage around.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.760
Where have you been all evening?

12:34.760 --> 12:36.800
Actually, I've been to a brothel.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.920
Maybe don't mention that
when your mother asks.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.000
Hello, Doctor.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.640
Congratulations, Reinhardt.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.320
The killer in custody already!

13:02.320 --> 13:04.680
This calls for a little celebration.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.000
Cheers!

13:06.000 --> 13:07.360
Thank you.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.800
Congratulations.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.480
Inspector, do you think
we'll find the weapon?

13:11.480 --> 13:14.920
I'll instigate a search.
We go to his home at dawn.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.440
Well done, my friend.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.760
Where did your friend go,
the Jew-Doctor?

13:20.760 --> 13:22.760
I thought you couldn't
function without him?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.640
It must be embarrassing.
The Commissioner won't let you

13:25.640 --> 13:28.360
take charge unless
Liebermann's holding your hand.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.040
What was that you said?

13:30.040 --> 13:32.560
All these people congratulating
me. I can't hear you.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.360
Congratulations. Thank you.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.000
Congratulations. Thanks.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.360
What he did to those women...

13:44.440 --> 13:45.920
I've got two daughters.

13:45.920 --> 13:49.000
Just give me half an hour
alone in a room with him.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.720
Amelia.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.040
You're completely safe here.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.840
We missed you this evening, Max.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.760
Yes, er, sorry.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.440
Why are you up so late?

14:53.440 --> 14:55.600
I wanted to tell you about my evening.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.400
Rather an unconventional
party, as it turned out.

14:58.400 --> 15:02.400
Yes, look... I mean, with the groom
running out on his future bride.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.120
If you wanted to create an
impression, you certainly succeeded.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.360
What was so important?

15:08.360 --> 15:10.080
The murder in Spittelberg.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.960
And you just had to be there?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.280
Yes
- the police needed me.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.000
The nature of the crime,
it was... unusual.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.520
Pathological obsessive.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.560
Obsessive is certainly
the right word here.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.400
Leah... You're a doctor, Max.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.680
A junior doctor.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.640
Whatever ambitions you may entertain...

15:26.640 --> 15:28.880
Your impression of Mother
is really getting sharp now.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.080
Keep working on it.
Oh, just shut up and listen to me!

15:32.080 --> 15:35.640
Clara is my friend. I care about her.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.240
I wish you'd look at
yourself for a change

15:38.240 --> 15:40.520
instead of those damned patients!

15:40.520 --> 15:41.720
Look at your own behaviour.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.680
What do you think it says?

15:43.680 --> 15:47.520
This is not how a man in love behaves.

16:14.920 --> 16:18.160
Are you planning to follow me around
every time I have a murder case?

16:18.160 --> 16:21.000
Yes, that's my current plan.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.720
Hmm.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.320
Lucky me.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.000
My son is innocent!

16:33.000 --> 16:35.120
You have no right to be here.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.360
We need to find the weapon.
Are you going to help me look?

16:44.360 --> 16:47.080
Or did you just come for a fun day out?

16:47.080 --> 16:48.480
Hmm?

16:51.160 --> 16:52.800
Something's troubling me.

16:55.120 --> 16:58.440
His mother said he spent all his
money on going to see that girl.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.440
So, what of it?

17:00.440 --> 17:02.240
Well, she was his addiction.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.200
Why would he destroy the thing he loved?

17:05.280 --> 17:07.160
We need an explanation.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.319
Sir! You need to see this!

17:10.319 --> 17:12.599
No, my son works in an abattoir!

17:32.440 --> 17:34.800
A break-in at the city zoo.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.480
A reptile was stolen
- butchered.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.080
Found it draped by a statue of Mozart.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.240
So, somebody doesn't like music.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.680
Inspector?

17:50.680 --> 17:52.160
Sort this out, von Bulow.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.920
It's a damned snake!

18:02.920 --> 18:05.120
Did he try to explain the blood?

18:05.120 --> 18:07.640
His mother says he works in an abattoir.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.400
This is it.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.200
This is the evidence we needed.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.000
Well done, Rheinhardt.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.560
And what about motive?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.960
The man's clearly insane!

18:19.960 --> 18:21.920
Insane is not a catch-all, Inspector.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.320
Even the most disturbed mind
has its own kind of logic.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.680
Anything else to add before
we charge him, Doctor?

18:30.120 --> 18:32.480
The killer exhibited what
I can only describe as

18:32.480 --> 18:34.360
two opposing personalities.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.320
Extreme brutality, yes,
but also a kind of love.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.960
The way he cleansed the
corpse of the youngest victim.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.880
He visited the brothel every day.

18:41.880 --> 18:45.200
Exactly
- love, obsession.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.560
But the other half is missing.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.080
What are you saying?

18:50.320 --> 18:52.080
I'm not convinced he's the killer.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.520
I've got a suspect in custody downstairs

18:59.520 --> 19:01.760
with blood sprayed around
his damned apartment!

19:01.760 --> 19:03.080
We know he was on the scene.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.640
Why are you so keen to let him go?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.400
Why are you so keen to charge him?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.120
God, you're still insufferable.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.960
People are scared.
We needed to make an arrest.

19:12.960 --> 19:16.080
Look, I admit, he's gruesome.
He's unprepossessing, he's slow.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.480
He plays into all our prejudices.
It doesn't make him a killer, though.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.520
Doctor, this is my domain.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.160
Thank you, but I didn't invite you.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.800
Gentlemen, settle down, please.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.120
Gentlemen, please, please.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.960
I'm proud to say that
we have charged someone

19:40.960 --> 19:43.280
for the brutal killings in Spittelberg.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.680
What about a name?
Can you give us a name?

19:45.680 --> 19:48.400
Oskar Rheinhardt was
the arresting officer.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.560
Can you tell us?
Can you give us some details?

19:50.560 --> 19:53.240
Is there something you
can tell us about...?

19:53.240 --> 19:56.200
The name of the accused is Viktor Krull.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.360
K-R-U-L-L.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.760
Patient admitted yesterday.

20:14.760 --> 20:18.800
49-year-old male, suffering
from a most unusual disorder.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.000
What I can only describe as
a sort of erotic paranoia.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.080
He believes the Emperor's daughter,

20:24.080 --> 20:27.040
the Archduchess Marie,
that they are betrothed.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.080
That they are lovers, in fact.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.920
He was arrested yesterday

20:30.920 --> 20:34.040
trying to scale the gate of the palace.

20:34.040 --> 20:38.120
Bieber, his name is. A book-keeper.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.560
Who wants to do the
preliminary examination?

20:42.840 --> 20:44.280
Er, I will, Professor.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.400
Liebermann, are you
sure you're not too busy

20:48.400 --> 20:49.760
with your other engagements?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.840
Herr Bieber? My name is Dr Liebermann.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.000
I know what goes on here.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.360
I know your barbaric methods.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.760
Well, I only want to talk to you.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.560
"Talk"?!

21:13.280 --> 21:15.480
Sunday afternoon,
I was walking to the tram station,

21:15.480 --> 21:17.360
just beyond the palace.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.360
Something caught my attention.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.240
I saw something behind the window.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.080
I...

21:25.080 --> 21:27.560
I knew it was her.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.920
I knew she was signalling to me.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.080
How did you know the
signal was meant for you?

21:33.840 --> 21:36.560
When you meet your true love, Doctor,

21:36.560 --> 21:39.800
the power of this attraction
is just irresistible.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.040
So you believe you and the Duchess

21:46.040 --> 21:47.960
were pre-ordained as lovers?

21:50.160 --> 21:52.800
Everyone has a true love, Doctor.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.880
Surely you believe that?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.680
It would be easier for you

21:56.680 --> 21:59.280
to try to stop the sun
from crossing the heavens

21:59.280 --> 22:01.520
than to prevent our union.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.960
We are simply meant to be together.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.040
Well, I'm glad I suggested we come here.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.680
It's been a real treat.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.640
Particularly the conversation.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.640
Sorry, Clara.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.040
My friends told me not to marry you.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.800
Which friends?

22:31.640 --> 22:34.240
Your sister has been pretty damning.

22:34.240 --> 22:38.440
Yes, well, she's never forgiven me
for the time I cut her doll's hair.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.600
You see? You do know how to smile.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.640
Do you think obsession
is the same as love?

22:50.840 --> 22:52.960
What are you trying to tell me?

22:52.960 --> 22:55.360
I want to be with you,
you want to be with me -

22:55.360 --> 22:56.800
surely that's enough.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.520
I wasn't talking about us, Clara.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.440
I was just thinking about a case.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.520
I'm sorry.
No... I want you to talk about it.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.080
We're going to be married.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.840
I want to be a part of everything.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.920
Wait for me.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.360
Miss Lydgate.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.960
Dr Liebermann.

23:55.640 --> 23:59.560
Er, yes, of course.
You work here, I forgot, sorry.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.280
So, you decided to stay in Vienna?

24:06.120 --> 24:07.800
Apparently.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.960
Oh, yes... I thought
you might have left.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.720
Well, how could I, after your
city's extraordinary hospitality?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.040
I'm sorry, er, I must go.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.280
I have thought about you...

24:22.280 --> 24:24.240
Actually, I had wondered...

24:26.240 --> 24:27.520
Hello.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.560
Er, er, you remember Miss Lydgate?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.600
No, I don't... I don't think we've met.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.240
Miss Clara Weiss.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.520
My, er, fiancee.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.080
Delighted. Delighted.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.160
Please, don't let me interrupt.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.440
Enjoy your visit.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.160
Crazy woman.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.160
She doesn't remember me.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.360
She doesn't remember any of it.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.400
Congratulations.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.800
You're going to be a very wealthy man.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.760
I'm grateful for your investment.

25:15.760 --> 25:19.040
I have an eye for a successful
venture, Herr Liebermann.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.520
These new premises will be magnificent.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.520
I'm going to start interviews
for staff immediately.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.160
What sort of people
will you be employing?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.600
I'm sorry? Hungarians?

25:30.600 --> 25:32.000
Czechs?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.640
You seem to have quite a few already.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.160
So many citizens of the Empire,
flocking to make their home here.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.880
Will you take a little
advice from a friend?

25:45.600 --> 25:46.920
I found this.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.000
The mood of the city is changing.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.120
There you are, sir.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.120
Splendid! Inspector?

26:28.120 --> 26:30.280
I don't think I could've
survived another minute

26:30.280 --> 26:32.240
without your presence...
You charged him?

26:32.240 --> 26:34.640
Yes, I charged him.
We had all the material evidence.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.000
And then you plastered his
name all over the newspapers!

26:37.000 --> 26:40.360
People need reassurance.
They need to know the city's safe.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.840
Please do have a seat.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.200
I know this man, Inspector.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.480
He's been met with
rejection his whole life.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.120
And then, finally,
when someone showed him kindness...

26:49.120 --> 26:51.760
I think he went over
there and found her,

26:51.760 --> 26:54.160
her body bathed in blood,
her throat cut,

26:54.160 --> 26:55.600
and he was distraught.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.240
So, he washed the corpse

26:57.240 --> 27:00.880
and he placed the crucifix in
her hands, but he didn't kill her.

27:00.880 --> 27:04.280
You want to convince me? I need proof.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.960
What do you think we'll find here?

27:12.360 --> 27:14.200
First piece of the puzzle.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.560
All right. Thank you.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.680
Madame Borek.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.200
The owner?

27:26.200 --> 27:29.120
Something about her state
of mind doesn't make sense.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.000
See...

27:31.000 --> 27:33.880
..she kept the door
locked up and bolted tight.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.800
Had more than her fair share of trouble.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.920
Yes, that's exactly my point.

27:40.920 --> 27:44.480
Yet she let a killer waltz in
here with a weapon in his hand.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.400
God.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.920
Max, my officers already
searched the place.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.600
Yes, but...

28:15.360 --> 28:17.600
..they didn't know what
they were looking for.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.520
A-ha!

28:23.520 --> 28:24.640
See?

28:24.640 --> 28:28.200
Why didn't she reach down
here and draw this gun?

28:28.200 --> 28:31.160
Why didn't she try to
stop him from entering?

28:33.920 --> 28:36.880
Oh, you want me to guess
what you're thinking?

28:36.880 --> 28:40.040
Good, because I love playing your games.

28:40.040 --> 28:44.160
Customer walks in here, flourishing
three feet of hardened steel.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.440
And she simply curtsies
and welcomes him in?

28:46.440 --> 28:48.120
The gun is untouched.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.560
Explain that to me.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.440
Somehow... he didn't seem threatening.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.200
Good. Why?

29:00.440 --> 29:01.680
Somehow...

29:03.480 --> 29:06.560
..she expected him to
be holding the weapon.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.920
Excellent. Why?

29:09.360 --> 29:11.600
Oh, for God's sake, just tell me!

29:14.440 --> 29:16.520
I was at the museum today...

29:18.320 --> 29:20.360
..strolling through the crowds.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.600
Two soldiers walked straight past me,
armed with regimental swords.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.240
No-one was alarmed. No-one commented.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.640
It didn't seem out of the ordinary.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.160
So, you think he was a soldier?

29:34.760 --> 29:37.040
It would have made his
weapon practically invisible.

29:39.240 --> 29:42.760
It's dated same day as the murder.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.640
It's an IOU from a lieutenant.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.240
Well?

29:53.760 --> 29:55.120
Don't say it.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.320
Welcome to the case, Inspector.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.720
We know you were in that room.
That you washed her body.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.800
You put the cross in between her hands.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.120
I know you're afraid of
admitting to have been there.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.160
For God's sake, they'll hang you!

30:18.800 --> 30:21.120
I need you to tell me what you saw!

30:22.640 --> 30:24.280
We're getting nowhere, Doctor.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.320
Could you show me?

30:30.880 --> 30:32.360
Show me what you saw.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.160
Get some paper.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.680
Here.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.120
It's not conclusive. But...

32:12.560 --> 32:15.760
All right, it's worth investigating.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.200
I'll visit the barracks. And the blood -

32:18.200 --> 32:22.280
if what his mother said is true,
it may not even be human,

32:22.280 --> 32:25.440
but we have no proof it
belonged to those girls.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.080
A test?

32:42.080 --> 32:44.760
To determine if it's
human or animal blood.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.600
Does such a test exist?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.680
Yes - precipitin,
it's a simple chemical reaction.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.720
You can leave the
samples with me, Doctor.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.600
Max.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.240
I'm no longer your doctor.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.880
Thank you.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.160
Our regiment lives by a code.

33:29.160 --> 33:32.840
A strict code of honour
before God and our country.

33:32.840 --> 33:36.080
What you are suggesting is
preposterous, Inspector.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.560
The officers of the Dragoons
are not grubby murderers.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.440
Colonel... These men are my sons.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.760
If one of them truly was
a killer, as you suggest,

33:44.760 --> 33:47.200
then I would hold myself responsible.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.880
I would take out my pistol,

33:48.880 --> 33:51.560
hold it to my head
and blow my brains out.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.160
That won't be necessary.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.960
I just need a list of
officers garrisoned in Vienna.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.920
Soul of Christ, sanctify me.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.159
Body of Christ, save me.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.480
Got some friends for you, Viktor-boy.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.280
Keep you company.

34:35.320 --> 34:36.920
It's you.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.520
You're the sick bastard
who bled those women.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.720
Not human.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.120
Animal blood.

35:25.320 --> 35:29.120
Forgive me, what is the area
of your expertise, Miss...?

35:29.120 --> 35:30.920
..Lydgate.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.360
I'm a scientist.
A researcher at the museum.

35:34.360 --> 35:37.080
I asked Miss Lydgate to
consult on the case, Inspector.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.720
We need to release him.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.560
And you need to tell the press.

35:47.280 --> 35:50.520
Excuse me, sir.

35:50.520 --> 35:53.520
Down in the cell block.
Something's happened.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.800
Sick bastard! He got what he deserved!

35:56.800 --> 35:59.360
May he burn in hell! Enough!

35:59.360 --> 36:01.080
Just vagrants.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.480
We had nowhere else to put them.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.200
Busy night.

36:09.840 --> 36:13.320
Still... It's a kind of justice.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.640
Tell me you didn't put
them in here deliberately.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.120
I told you...

36:20.440 --> 36:22.120
It was very busy down here.

36:23.960 --> 36:28.400
You are not the damned judge and jury!

36:30.280 --> 36:32.560
He got what was coming to him.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.760
I'm responsible.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.760
I did this. Oskar, listen.

37:03.720 --> 37:07.200
Whoever butchered these women,
he's still out there.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.600
The only way to atone for
this mess is to find him.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.720
Oskar, please, wait!

37:20.720 --> 37:22.840
Don't blame yourself.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.200
Oskar! Oskar!

37:33.440 --> 37:34.960
Oskar, don't go!

37:36.760 --> 37:38.440
Dr Liebermann!

37:41.480 --> 37:43.560
May I speak with you a moment?

37:45.880 --> 37:47.880
I'm interested in your opinion.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.040
What sort of man would do that?

37:50.040 --> 37:52.640
You have a particular insight.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.120
You've been very helpful to Rheinhardt

37:55.120 --> 37:57.560
and I was hoping you
could be as helpful to me?

37:59.640 --> 38:02.040
We speak the same language, Doctor.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.800
Surely we can work together.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.120
It's not a random act.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.880
The snake is a symbol.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.040
A symbol of what?

38:15.040 --> 38:18.280
Well, find the significance,
you'll find the perpetrator.

38:24.560 --> 38:28.000
Your father's found new
premises. Seidengasse.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.680
Four floors
- prime site.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.680
Oh? Sounds interesting.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.640
Twice the size of the
offices by the Prater.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.360
Something wrong, Max?

38:36.360 --> 38:37.840
Where did you get this?

38:37.840 --> 38:39.400
A friend came across it.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.160
Have you been rooting through my things?

38:41.160 --> 38:43.640
I was looking for some
cufflinks. Have you read it?

38:43.640 --> 38:46.480
Rachel, perhaps if you're
finished, you might...?

38:46.480 --> 38:48.880
Yes, of course.
I'll leave you two alone for a moment.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.160
Leah?

38:57.600 --> 39:00.600
Do you know me at all, my son?
Is this who you think I am?

39:00.600 --> 39:03.080
It's a call to arms!
Merge with the German Reich

39:03.080 --> 39:04.800
before our Aryan blood is tainted!

39:04.800 --> 39:06.320
Oh, don't concern yourself.

39:06.320 --> 39:07.680
Don't concern myself?!

39:07.680 --> 39:10.120
You can't fight every battle, Max!

39:10.120 --> 39:12.280
This city is sick, Father.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.800
Beneath all this ornament,
there is an ingrained sickness

39:14.800 --> 39:16.640
and we can no longer turn our backs.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.480
What sort of band shall we hire?

39:25.480 --> 39:26.840
Band?

39:26.840 --> 39:28.560
Our wedding. Remember?

39:28.560 --> 39:29.840
Sorry.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.960
Max, where are you?

39:39.040 --> 39:41.080
You've been drifting.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.880
Yes, I know. I'm sorry,
Clara, it's this damned case.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.760
You're restless every
time we meet. Bored, even.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.440
I feel like I'm just an
interruption in your day.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.360
Just tell me what's wrong!

39:56.360 --> 39:58.520
Clara, I... No!

39:58.520 --> 40:00.160
Please don't follow me.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.360
A poultry seller. Czech.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.760
Look at the pattern of wounds.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.240
It's the same.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.040
It's exactly the same.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.120
Krull wasn't the killer.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.240
Now we have proof.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.120
Oskar!

41:36.120 --> 41:37.800
Oskar, wait!

41:37.800 --> 41:39.640
The marking on the wall.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.560
It's a signature.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.080
It tells us something crucial.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.280
What? What does it tell us?

41:48.280 --> 41:50.000
He wants us to find him.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
We're a part of his plan.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.880
You and I.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.440
Max?

42:24.960 --> 42:27.960
Krull must have moved the
bed to make his shrine.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.720
I know this symbol.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.360
"Purify our blood"?

43:04.760 --> 43:07.320
Max, who's responsible for this?

43:13.240 --> 43:15.560
Gustav von Triebenbach.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.440
I told you, he's a friend.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.280
He's honourable, a decent man.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.520
He found it and he
thought I should see it.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.440
The Brotherhood of Primal Fire.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.960
No name. No address of a printer.

43:30.960 --> 43:34.880
Wait. No artist leaves
his work unsigned.

43:41.280 --> 43:42.720
There.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.320
On the leg.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.400
"A Olbricht".

43:50.080 --> 43:52.120
Andreas Olbricht?

43:52.120 --> 43:54.680
Inspector Rheinhardt,
Leopoldstadt Police.

43:54.680 --> 43:57.800
This is my colleague,
Dr Liebermann. This is your work?

43:57.800 --> 44:00.240
What is this about, exactly?

44:00.240 --> 44:01.800
Is this your design?

44:03.120 --> 44:05.800
For the opera, The Magic Flute.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.640
Ah, yes, I'm taking Clara.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.320
Hasn't been on in Vienna for years.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.200
Tell me about the pamphlet.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.000
A private commissioner.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.520
Paid in cash.

44:21.480 --> 44:23.720
Wanted something with a classical theme.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.600
And the symbol on the shield?

44:27.600 --> 44:29.600
Specifically asked for it.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.920
Look at the content.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.200
Have you read it?

44:34.480 --> 44:37.880
A job is a job.
Politics do not interest me.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.800
"Consecrate our Earth"?

44:39.800 --> 44:41.760
It's a call to arms.

44:41.760 --> 44:44.240
"Rid Vienna of the inferior races"?

44:46.080 --> 44:49.720
Commissions are hard to come by.
That's why I'm doing this.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.480
It is paying for my meals.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.120
Five people have been murdered.

44:57.440 --> 44:59.320
Whoever commissioned this work,

44:59.320 --> 45:01.560
there's a chance he inspired the killer.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.800
We just need to know who paid for it.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.960
And if I tell you...

45:07.400 --> 45:09.360
..then I could lose business.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.480
Damn it, we're talking about murder!

45:13.440 --> 45:15.160
You get in my way,

45:15.160 --> 45:17.760
I'll drag you to trial
for obstructing justice!

45:17.760 --> 45:22.040
Andreas? What's... What's happening?

45:22.040 --> 45:23.840
What's going on?

45:23.840 --> 45:25.200
Just some visitors.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.600
Nothing to worry about.
Go back to sleep, Mother.

45:35.560 --> 45:37.240
Oskar... All right, all right!

45:40.560 --> 45:42.360
There's an exhibition of my work.

45:44.160 --> 45:45.480
The men you want...

45:47.160 --> 45:48.920
..the men who commissioned this...

45:50.120 --> 45:51.960
..they will all be there.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.320
"All"?

45:56.320 --> 45:58.480
The Brotherhood of Primal Fire.

46:05.600 --> 46:08.280
He died in custody.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.680
I saw the newspapers.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.640
Well, you tried to help us.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.240
Thank you.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.400
I, er...

46:30.320 --> 46:32.480
I wanted to ask you something.

46:32.480 --> 46:36.320
Before you say anything,
I need to make a little speech.

46:40.680 --> 46:43.600
You and I have had a strange beginning.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.440
Most people when they meet,

46:46.440 --> 46:48.800
they stand behind a veil of politeness.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.960
They dance around each other,
never saying what they mean.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.280
You and I have never done that, just...

46:54.280 --> 46:55.600
..force of circumstance.

46:56.600 --> 46:57.920
So...

46:59.360 --> 47:01.680
..I hope you'll forgive
me for being blunt.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.600
But then, blunt is the only
language we have ever spoken, Doctor.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.160
My life has been more settled of late.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.640
Yes, I'm glad to hear it. I was...

47:12.640 --> 47:14.880
I was grateful to have the opportunity

47:14.880 --> 47:16.560
to work with you on your case.

47:18.240 --> 47:21.880
But I think that's where
our... acquaintance should end.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.120
I don't think we should
see each other again.

47:30.520 --> 47:33.480
If I've offended you in some... No, Max.

47:39.320 --> 47:43.120
I am trying to rebuild
my life here in Vienna.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.160
Don't you see?

47:49.200 --> 47:52.720
After my illness and
the article in the paper,

47:52.720 --> 47:56.680
the... scandal that surrounded it.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.240
I didn't intend...

47:58.240 --> 48:00.800
You and I have only
ever spoken the truth.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.520
Good luck with your engagement.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.600
I was wrong.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.800
And I'm sorry.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.480
I never thought I'd bury my own child!

49:38.480 --> 49:40.760
You don't know how that feels!

49:44.000 --> 49:45.040
Yes...

49:47.040 --> 49:48.800
Yes, I do.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.240
Ah, good evening. Good evening.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.560
Welcome.

50:14.080 --> 50:15.480
My pleasure.

50:15.480 --> 50:19.720
I would be grateful if you
could be discreet, Doctor.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.920
Keep a muzzle on your inspector.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.120
Good evening, sir. Good evening.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.400
Thank you.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.960
Thank you.

50:34.960 --> 50:37.920
What for? For this.

50:37.920 --> 50:41.040
For taking me out. For reminding me.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.720
Reminding you of what?

50:42.720 --> 50:44.920
That we do know how to be happy.

50:48.360 --> 50:50.280
Like something from a chocolate box.

50:51.240 --> 50:54.680
Oh, of course.
They're not the modern taste.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.560
You can't just make somebody
look pretty and desirable.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.240
Don't tell me, you like them.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.040
Well, let me see if I can find one

51:01.040 --> 51:04.320
to hang above the mantelpiece
in our new home. Yes.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.280
Max? Isn't that your inspector?

51:11.600 --> 51:13.360
Inspector Rheinhardt.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.560
Doctor.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.040
Oh, you remember my fiancee, Clara.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.440
Fraulein.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.480
You came to our engagement party.

51:21.480 --> 51:24.200
Yes, thank you. What are you doing here?

51:24.200 --> 51:26.800
I thought Max was taking me out.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.360
Er...

51:28.360 --> 51:31.440
I didn't realise there were three
of us. That's going to make it

51:31.440 --> 51:34.440
awfully difficult when we
choose dance partners. Clara...

51:34.440 --> 51:36.440
You forgot to mention he was coming.

51:36.440 --> 51:39.280
Well, never mind.
You forget so many things these days.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.680
I'd be surprised if he
shows up to the wedding.

51:45.960 --> 51:47.760
Let me leave you boys alone.

51:52.600 --> 51:54.440
Beautiful girl.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.080
Energetic. Wonderful humour.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.320
I wonder what attracts her to you.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.720
Yes, I've been starting
to think the same thing.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.160
Olbricht said they'd all be here.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.560
The Brotherhood.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.680
Let's get to work, Doctor.

52:36.280 --> 52:40.440
Looks like it ought to be stuck
inside a book of fairy tales.

52:40.440 --> 52:42.000
You're not an admirer?

52:42.000 --> 52:43.720
My uncle has no eye for art.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.000
I come for the champagne.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.880
Your uncle?

52:48.880 --> 52:50.400
Yes.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.400
Gustav von Triebenbach.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.200
It's his champagne you're drinking.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.680
So, that's von Triebenbach? Yes.

52:58.680 --> 53:00.080
He's our host.

53:00.080 --> 53:04.120
Which rather begs the question
- how did you get in here?

53:04.120 --> 53:06.640
I'm a friend of the artist. Ah.

53:08.040 --> 53:11.160
Me, too. Welcome.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.400
I don't know your name.

53:14.400 --> 53:15.880
Er, Max. Max Liebermann.

53:18.520 --> 53:20.320
Er, I didn't catch yours.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.600
I didn't give it.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.800
Now...

53:32.800 --> 53:34.160
..that's art.

53:35.080 --> 53:38.440
Sorry? Her. In gold.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.640
Excuse me.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.680
But I prefer...

53:53.400 --> 53:56.280
"Thou art fairer than the evening air

53:56.280 --> 53:59.800
"Clad in the beauty
of a thousand stars."

53:59.800 --> 54:01.360
How many times?

54:03.200 --> 54:04.760
I beg your pardon?

54:04.760 --> 54:08.640
Every gentleman in Vienna knows
two lines of poetry by heart.

54:08.640 --> 54:10.680
How many times have
you used it this week?

54:15.200 --> 54:18.360
How many girls are fairer
than the evening air?

54:20.200 --> 54:21.560
Ruprecht Hafner.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.640
Clara Weiss.

54:28.320 --> 54:30.400
Clad in the beauty of...?

54:30.400 --> 54:31.920
What was it?

54:31.920 --> 54:33.240
A thousand stars.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.280
Yes.

54:48.760 --> 54:50.000
Is everything all right?

54:51.800 --> 54:53.160
Of course.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.600
It's von Triebenbach.

55:09.280 --> 55:11.360
Carnuntum. Yeah.

55:14.280 --> 55:15.520
Carnuntum.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.280
You know your history?

55:18.280 --> 55:19.720
History?

55:19.720 --> 55:23.000
No, I thought it was
just a folk tale. Ha.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.920
The, er, tribesmen rise up,
rid the land of the invaders.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.160
No.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.760
No, no, no, no.

55:28.760 --> 55:31.320
You're an author. I beg your pardon?

55:36.000 --> 55:37.120
Isn't this your work?

55:43.240 --> 55:45.920
I'm sorry. You are mistaken.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.320
Thank you.

56:04.920 --> 56:06.840
One of them is responsible.

56:17.280 --> 56:20.400
Max? How was your evening?

56:25.440 --> 56:27.280
Your friend, von Triebenbach...

56:27.280 --> 56:28.800
Mm-hm. What about him?

56:30.840 --> 56:33.400
He may not be as
honourable as you imagine.

56:33.400 --> 56:35.000
What on Earth are you talking about?

56:36.120 --> 56:37.760
That pamphlet he gave you...

56:39.160 --> 56:41.120
He didn't find it by accident.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.080
The Brotherhood of Primal Fire,

56:43.080 --> 56:44.760
I think he may be one of them.

56:52.920 --> 56:55.880
I'm in a bedroom. My parents' room.

56:55.880 --> 56:59.040
The wardrobe looks like a mausoleum
- dark, frightening.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.440
The door begins to creak open.

57:02.440 --> 57:06.280
A terrifying beast jumps out of it,
like a wolf from a children's story.

57:06.280 --> 57:08.320
And then another one
jumps out right beside it.

57:08.320 --> 57:11.720
Two wolves coming towards me,
threatening to tear me to pieces.

57:11.720 --> 57:14.760
Two ravenous beasts,
writhing, trying to kill me.

57:14.760 --> 57:17.880
The patient has a primal fear
of sex, no doubt from something

57:17.880 --> 57:19.760
he witnessed as a child. Two beasts.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.280
The creatures in the wardrobe
represent the bodies of his parents.

57:23.280 --> 57:26.840
He saw them together.
And now he finds sex repulsive.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.560
He's chosen to give his heart to a woman

57:28.560 --> 57:30.920
with whom he has no hope
of ever becoming intimate.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.600
Freud recommends a talking cure.

57:32.600 --> 57:33.960
Ah! Freud again!

57:33.960 --> 57:35.680
The patient must re-live the memory.

57:35.680 --> 57:38.560
Expressed emotions do not merely
sink without a trace, Professor.

57:38.560 --> 57:40.240
They bubble up to the surface.

57:40.240 --> 57:41.960
I don't like your methods, Liebermann.

57:41.960 --> 57:44.200
I've warned you,
this is science, not fashion.

57:44.200 --> 57:45.880
I'll take his case.

57:45.880 --> 57:47.560
But, sir, I'm just making progress.

57:58.240 --> 58:00.640
Max, you're way too early.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.680
You don't know how many doors
I've knocked on in Vienna.

58:14.840 --> 58:15.880
May I?

58:17.320 --> 58:18.760
Yes, of course.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.240
There's something wrong.

58:41.640 --> 58:44.280
Things will have to change, Rachel.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.160
What things?

58:48.480 --> 58:50.160
My new investment.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.880
I may not be able to
rely on it, after all.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.360
Oh, no, what a pity!

58:58.200 --> 59:01.640
That new outfit you had
your eye on for winter,

59:01.640 --> 59:05.280
our spring holiday, those things
may have to wait another year.

59:06.840 --> 59:09.680
What's happened? What's the matter?

59:11.760 --> 59:14.800
Someone I've been
courting as a friend...

59:14.800 --> 59:17.120
..I no longer wish to
be associated with.

59:22.080 --> 59:23.760
We have everything we need...

59:25.040 --> 59:26.840
..and we're strong as a family.

59:28.960 --> 59:30.480
We don't need anyone.

59:47.040 --> 59:48.720
All dressed up for someone.

59:48.720 --> 59:50.400
We're going to the opera.

59:51.640 --> 59:52.960
"We"?

59:55.400 --> 59:56.720
So...

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.280
..I'll have to wait my turn, then.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.440
"Turn" doesn't exactly
sound respectful to a lady.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.480
Whoever he is,

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.480
he's become a bore, I can tell.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080
If you ever need cheering up,

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.240
then I would be happy
to entertain you...

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.040
..Fraulein.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.920
These are all political acts.
It's not the work of some lunatic.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.720
Those women at the
brothel were immigrants.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.320
The poultry seller was Czech.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.440
You see?

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.800
You're telling me that,
from this moment,

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.960
any immigrant in this
city is under threat?

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.240
If we announce that fact,
we will have public panic.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.800
What is it?

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.000
There's some other
connection, beside the runes.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.240
I just can't see it yet.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.640
I'm sorry.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.280
Please...

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.000
..forgive me. Hm.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.120
Are you going to be angry all evening?

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.880
I think I should at least be
permitted a pout, don't you?

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.040
Excuse me.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.160
Is your inspector joining us again?

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.600
Max, what's the matter?

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.240
Max?

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.280
Come with me.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.920
It begins like this.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.520
The first image on stage is
a snake. The giant serpent,

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.920
striking to kill the prince.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.120
So? What are you telling me?

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.080
Von Bulow's case. The city zoo.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.160
Someone broke into the reptile
house and a snake was butchered,

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.400
found hanging near Mozart's statue.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.800
Next on stage, three women appear.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.440
Mozart calls them

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.200
the "servants of the
Queen of the Night".

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.600
Max, what are you talking about?

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.160
The women meet with
Papageno, the bird-catcher.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.600
The poultry seller!

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.760
Dear Christ!

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.080
Monostatos is the next
character on stage.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.080
The Moor. The African who died.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.160
It's not random. No.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.680
He's re-enacting the opera?

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.600
You wanted to share my world, Clara.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.800
The killer is preaching
a political message,

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.440
killing Africans and Czechs.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.240
And it's all connected
to the opera somehow.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.760
That's absurd, young man.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.000
Incredible!

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.960
Your emblem written in blood...

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.800
..beside these mutilated bodies.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.160
"Consecrate our Earth,

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.080
"purify our blood."

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.240
I'm not responsible.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.840
You are part of this Brotherhood.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.000
Sir? I found this.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.840
These men are all patriots, Inspector.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.600
They've done nothing illegal.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.520
You can't lock a man up
just for waving a banner.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.880
Where were you last night?

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.200
Can you account for your movements?

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.880
I was with a lady.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.240
Now, leave me alone.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.560
You asked to see me again?

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.200
Our contract.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.080
I'm cancelling it.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.400
I'm sorry?

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.600
I've decided I don't
want your investment.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.000
What the hell are you talking about?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.480
These people who you say
are polluting the city,

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.720
the workers from the East...

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.040
I have a responsibility to them.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.760
They are my friends,
as well as my colleagues.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.800
Ah...

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.920
Er...

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.800
You're a Jew.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.080
You're going to need
people to support you.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.720
I have just as many friends as I need.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.160
Nobody throws me out, Herr Liebermann.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.359
Well, then, this has been
a new experience for you.

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.560
What happened?

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.560
With the opera killer?

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.720
Yes.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.399
We didn't make an arrest.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.840
Don't concern yourself.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.960
I want to concern myself.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.560
Max, I knew what I was getting

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.439
when I agreed to marry you.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:26.720
I know the world you inhabit
is dark and frightening.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.319
And, still, I want to be a part of it.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:30.720
So?

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.520
I know who's responsible
for these murders, Clara.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.040
But I just can't prove it.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.359
Well, tell me, who is it?

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.279
Hafner. He's a soldier.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.600
You met him, actually, at the salon.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:50.000
I have to go to the hospital.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.920
Thank you for listening to me.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.200
Would you see that this is
delivered to the barracks?

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.440
Thank you.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.960
Herr Bieber?

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.800
Doctor.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.480
You're leaving.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.080
Yes, they say I'm well again.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.320
Did he...

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.440
Professor Gruner... I mean, did he...?

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.000
He made me forget. Yes.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.920
Please, come in.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.040
I suppose you've got some
more lines of poetry memorised.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.040
Spent the whole afternoon
in the library. Hmm.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.760
What do I get for my efforts?

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.600
What about some conversation?

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.320
What about none at all?

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.560
I was very delighted to get your letter.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.040
I want to talk.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.600
I want to get to know you better.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.160
We're all alone.
I want to know all your secrets.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.920
Max?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.440
No.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.680
Please, don't.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.760
I just want to talk.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.840
That's not what you really mean.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.040
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.080
Little girls shouldn't tease
if they're not going to play.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.000
Shh, shh, shh...

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Don't struggle...

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.920
Get off! ..or it'll hurt more.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.880
Trust me, you'll like it,
once you get past the shame!

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.680
Clara!

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.160
Clara! Clara!

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.280
Well... This must be
a scene I recognise.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.920
The impotent boyfriend,

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.000
jealous that I got to
touch what he didn't.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.320
Seems you can't get enough
of my company, Doctor.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.880
Apparently, you want to
make love to me more than

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.400
to your little girlfriend.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.400
No, you're not going anywhere!

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.600
God save us.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.200
You're all the same.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.440
Woman sits at home ignored.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.320
As soon as a man comes sniffing round,

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.000
suddenly you're flourishing.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.120
Dawn.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.520
Vienna Woods.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.760
I'm so sorry, Clara.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.440
You have to arrest him. Arrest him?

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.880
He assaulted her!

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.560
Then it's his word against hers.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.240
What, you don't believe me?

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.640
It doesn't matter what I believe.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.160
She invited him into her home, Max.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.160
We'll arrest him for putting his hands
on her and he'll just walk out of here.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.200
Her reputation will be tarnished forever

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.760
and he will have a story to
boast about to his comrades.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.920
I have to get him to confess.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.720
What are you talking about now?

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.960
Vienna Woods, dawn. Meet me there.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.920
You're going to fight a duel with him?
Well, that's ridiculous!

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.960
I'm not going to fight him!
I'll get him to admit the truth.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.200
If he thinks I'm going to die,
perhaps he'll confess

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.440
to being the killer.
I'll need a second, of course.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.720
It can't be you.
He knows you're a police officer.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:21.920
No.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.440
No!

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.320
You want me to...?

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.480
What? Be a witness. Hear his confession.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.880
This is absurd.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.880
Inspector Rheinhardt will be on hand.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.680
But you can make the arrest.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.720
You can have all the glory.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.200
I, er, don't trust von Bulow.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.960
You should be there to step in.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.200
I spend my life saving your skin.
Why should today be different?

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.560
Do nothing until I say.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.200
Where is Rheinhardt? Nearby.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.840
Shut up and keep walking.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.480
I want to be the one to make the arrest.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.680
You will. Just wait for the confession.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.520
Who is the offended party?

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.200
He struck me.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.160
For unlacing the top two
rows of a woman's corset.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.440
In accordance with the established
code, it is for you to confirm

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.960
before these witnesses
the terms of engagement.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.120
Death.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.560
Take your positions.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.960
Stand back-to-back.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.920
March 20 paces from the
moment I raise my kerchief.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.520
After 20 paces,

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.760
you turn...

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.000
..and fire.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.800
Gentlemen?

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.360
Anything to say before
I blow your brains out?

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.960
Yes, I just wanted to congratulate you.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.440
What?

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.760
The blood on the walls
- you left a trail for us.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.480
What?

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.120
Three women, the Czech,
Papageno, Monostatos.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.280
It's all very clever.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.760
I don't understand.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.320
I'm talking about Spittelberg.

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.840
You think I'm responsible for that?

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.800
Begin!

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.600
Don't be so modest.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.200
Enjoy the adulation.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.200
You wanted an audience. Well, here I am.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.080
Why not confess to me now?!

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.760
I'll never be able to tell a soul!

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.560
I'm not a murderer!

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.880
I'm an officer in the Dragoons!

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.360
Gentlemen, stop!
The rules are quite clear.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.640
You are accusing me? Begin again!

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:06.280
We know a Dragoon visited
the brothel the day they died.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.440
So? So what?

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.640
Gentlemen!

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.800
We know a soldier was in that room.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.920
We all go there.
I've been there many times.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.280
A friend took me.
Doesn't make me a killer.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.360
"A friend"?

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.600
What friend?

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.120
Tell me his name.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.640
What friend?!

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.480
I'm a friend of the artist.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.000
Me, too.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.240
What are you doing?

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.400
Stop! Pick it up!

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.520
Dr Liebermann!

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.640
What did he say?

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.160
Pick it up!

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.320
Inspector!

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.360
Can I make my arrest now?

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.880
Oskar!

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:57.480
Oskar!

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.480
Oskar!

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.520
I haven't seem him.
He didn't come in this morning.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.240
Sarastro.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.320
What?

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.120
The character in the opera,
the one who brings him to trial.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.480
Oskar is Sarastro!

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.800
That's why he left the runes.
He wanted us to follow him.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.960
He needed a policeman
to be the next victim.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.200
He was casting the villain!

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.880
Is anybody out there?

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.360
Can you hear...?

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.360
Olbricht!

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:32.760
Olbricht!

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.880
Andreas? Is that you?

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.480
We're the police.
Where is he? Where is your son?

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.200
It's you.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.200
You're the woman in the paintings.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.360
Ah.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.000
Overture.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.080
Olbricht!

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.080
Get out of here!

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.120
I will maim him.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.560
I will kill him.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.480
Leave.

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.920
What? It's all right, leave.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.560
I'm not with the police.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.600
I'm a doctor. Get out.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.240
Out!

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.920
This music...

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.280
The opera...

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.280
Tell me what happened. What happened?

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.480
Your mother.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:02.240
She's the one in the paintings.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.720
Something happened to
her when you were a boy.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.040
You saw it.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.640
Something happened in your family home.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.560
Who was he?

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.800
A soldier.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.360
Vermin.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.600
He attacked her.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.400
You witnessed it.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.480
You were so young.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.440
I hid my eyes.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.880
You could still hear it, the music.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.200
The opera
- this opera. The Magic Flute.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.800
It was playing whilst
he raped your mother.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.720
He was a monster.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.160
Held a sabre to her face.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.920
You think if you can kill
the characters in that opera,

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.680
kill the characters from your childhood,

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.480
then the screaming will stop.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.360
I always have it in my head.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.560
I know.

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.400
Every day, I have the voices...

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.520
..the hell in that room.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.200
I have to be a hero, a soldier.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.240
But you're just a boy trying
to kill his nightmares.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.560
It is me! It is me!

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.920
I am Tamino!

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.600
I am the prince.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:03.680
It's all over now.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.160
I thought you were going to die.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.960
I just wanted to help you.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.280
You were brave.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.720
Clara, thank you...

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.040
I can be even braver.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.200
Who is she, Max?

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.880
I know there's someone.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.560
You think I'm not clever enough.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.640
You always have.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.200
Don't... Clara, please.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.280
But I'm clever enough to know
that we're deceiving ourselves...

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.160
..and I'm brave enough
to end this marriage.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.360
Certainly braver than you are.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.040
Just tell me who she is.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.440
Do you love her?!

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.560
I don't even know myself.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.800
So, I know more than the
doctor? Please, Clara...

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.920
I'd prefer it if you go now.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.560
Get out!

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.880
If love is just a state of madness,

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.760
then perhaps it can be cured.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.000
But where does the
madness begin and end?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.600
Where does the border lie
between love and obsession?
