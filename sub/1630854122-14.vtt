most about New York?

00:20.950 --> 00:22.420
Mm.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.420
I'd trade my right pinky
for a doughnut.

00:24.620 --> 00:25.760
- [laughs]
- A real one.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.520
Not the Hungarian kind
made of candle wax.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.760
- Why does every American
who works in law enforcement

00:30.960 --> 00:32.530
have this obsession
with doughnuts?

00:32.730 --> 00:34.530
- Oh, you're about to get
some Kellett-pedia.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.270
- Can you handle it?
- Sure. Fire away.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.570
- During World War II...
- Oh, God.

00:39.770 --> 00:42.810
- Graveyard shift cops
worked long hours.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.340
Nothing but sack lunches,

00:45.540 --> 00:47.380
maybe the rare 24-hour diner,

00:47.580 --> 00:49.450
- and...
- Doughnut shops.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.980
- Always cheap.
Always convenient.

00:52.180 --> 00:53.380
And how do you know this?

00:53.580 --> 00:55.320
- My grandfather was
a deputy inspector,

00:55.520 --> 00:57.550
66th precinct, Brooklyn.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.920
- So law enforcement
is in your blood.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.820
- Mm-hmm.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.760
- Do you have any, uh,
dinner plans Friday night?

01:04.960 --> 01:07.360
Thinking about doing some
traditional cooking.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.400

- I'd like that.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.340

01:12.530 --> 01:14.440

- A commercial aircraft

04:37.210 --> 04:39.480
received a bomb threat in route
from New York to Athens.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.440

04:41.640 --> 04:43.080
Jetstream flight W271.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.850
- The plane was in
Moroccan airspace.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.480
The pilot declared an emergency

04:46.680 --> 04:48.550
and contacted
local air traffic control.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.220
- Two jets from the royal
Moroccan air force

04:50.420 --> 04:52.720
diverted them to a remote air
strip just outside of Tangier.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.720
- Any reason to believe
the threat's legitimate?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.090
- The DOJ wants us
on the ground

04:56.290 --> 04:57.630
given the recent death
of Ayman al-Zahid.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.130
The second emir of al-Qaeda.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.900
- Since he was killed
in the US drone strike,

05:01.100 --> 05:02.430
there might be reciprocation.

05:02.630 --> 05:03.900
- Europol has
a counterterrorism

05:04.100 --> 05:05.800
cooperation agreement
with Morocco.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.200

necessitated

05:07.400 --> 05:09.340
a stronger relationship
when Moroccan citizens

05:09.540 --> 05:10.540
were linked to the attacks.

the cabin for explosives.

- You can't come.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.930
I applied CPR on the plane,
so he stabilized.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.640

06:25.750 --> 06:27.250
with my dad to the hospital.

06:27.450 --> 06:28.620
- That's because everyone
who was on the plane

06:28.820 --> 06:30.620
needs to be screened.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.320

06:32.520 --> 06:35.730

- If that's okay.
- That's all right.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.800

agreed to let you drive Tyler,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
if you do not let him
out of your sight.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.070
- On it.
- Hospital Crochet Blanco.

06:46.270 --> 06:47.540
- We'll need your passport
and backpack.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.010
- Passport's

06:50.210 --> 06:51.670
- All right, Smitty and I will
help with explosive detection.

- Kellett, baggage inspection.
- I'll screen the passengers.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.790
- you just let us know.
- Great.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.790
- We conducted
a threat assessment.

07:10.990 --> 07:13.960
Moved passengers away from
potential hazards.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.670
Divided individual areas
into search levels.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.230
- Any idea what
we're looking for?

07:18.430 --> 07:21.000
- Description of the explosive
device is unknown.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.010
Our primary areas of concern
are the passengers seating

07:24.210 --> 07:26.140

07:26.340 --> 07:29.080
carry-on luggage,

07:29.280 --> 07:31.580

we found this.

08:18.330 --> 08:21.460
- Al-Qaeda claimed
responsibility for the attack.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.800
- Nobody leaves the hanger

a Safeway chicken.

08:26.170 --> 08:29.200

Illegally.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440

a jailhouse confession.

09:44.710 --> 09:45.850
Anything you need.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.930

unusual sounds, wires,
vapors, mists, odors.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.000
Hot items. Anything hidden.

You find anything?

10:11.770 --> 10:13.240
No. You?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.680
- Smitty found this
in the bathroom trash.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.750
- Syringes can be used as tools
to ignite explosives.

10:18.950 --> 10:19.980
What about the passengers?

10:20.180 --> 10:21.380
- Screening,
including the flight crew.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.690
So far, none had felonies
or obvious connections

10:23.890 --> 10:26.490

but a U.S. air marshal

10:26.690 --> 10:28.160

- Not yet.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.470
Run a chemical analysis
on the syringe.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.770
See if it contains acetone,
benzine, or hydrogen peroxide.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.040
Got it.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.440

Hi. I'm here to see Mike Kemp.
I'm family. His son.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.160
Uh, spell it for me.

11:09.360 --> 11:13.400
- Kemp. K-E-M-P.
The American from the plane.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.870
<i>[TV chatter]</i>

11:16.070 --> 11:17.370
We don't have any patients

11:17.570 --> 11:19.110
who were admitted
under that name.

11:19.310 --> 11:21.610
- Paramedics brought him in
within the last hour.

11:21.810 --> 11:25.850
- No. Only ambulance patient
was a Moroccan having a baby.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.320
Ambulance 43.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.750
They take him
to another hospital?

11:28.950 --> 11:30.750
- Moroccan ambulances don't
have registration numbers

11:30.950 --> 11:35.560
on their vehicles, and there's
only one hospital in town.

11:37.390 --> 11:38.560
Where the hell is my dad?

11:38.760 --> 11:43.130
Look, he's athletic,
5'9", gray hair. Look.

11:43.330 --> 11:44.930
He has to be here.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.500
- Forrester, hey.
I could be way off here,

11:47.700 --> 11:48.970
but my gut's telling me
this whole thing

11:49.170 --> 11:50.610
- was about something else.
- What happened?

11:50.810 --> 11:52.740
- The passenger who was having
a medical emergency

11:52.940 --> 11:56.380
is a DEA agent and he never
showed up to the hospital.

11:56.580 --> 11:59.380
I think we've got
a kidnapping on our hands.

12:06.590 --> 12:07.660
- I'm not finding
any combustible chemicals,

12:07.860 --> 12:09.990
acetone, benzine,
or hydrogen peroxide.

12:10.190 --> 12:12.160
It's unlikely it was used
for a bomb.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.360
- So the bomb threat was
deliberately faked

12:14.560 --> 12:17.400
in order to divert the plane
and abduct this kid's dad?

12:17.600 --> 12:19.670
Special agent Mike Kemp, 61.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.600
Joined the DEA in 1982.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.270
Disrupted the East Coast
drug corridor

12:23.470 --> 12:26.140
that runs from New York
to Boston to Toronto.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.980
Transferred to
The Hague, Netherlands in 2011.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.750
- Okay, but who would be
dumb enough to kidnap

12:30.950 --> 12:33.950
an American DEA agent
in Morocco?

12:34.150 --> 12:35.450
Mocro Mafia.

12:35.650 --> 12:36.950
Powerful cartel.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.890
Controls the drug trade
in the EU.

12:40.090 --> 12:43.630
Responsible for assassinations
in broad daylight.

12:43.820 --> 12:45.900
Beheadings. That's just
the tip of the iceberg.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.930
- Hope that's not the case,
but the Netherlands

12:48.130 --> 12:49.770
is the nerve center
for drug trafficking.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.430
- The cartel have been
importing cocaine

12:51.630 --> 12:52.630
and synthetic drugs through

12:52.830 --> 12:54.200
Europe's harbors
by the metric ton.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.840
- Why not abduct him
in the Netherlands?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.510
It seems one hell
of a lot easier.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.410
- Because Morocco
is their home turf.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.940
The cartel is not gonna put

13:01.140 --> 13:04.280
a target on their back
by abducting a DEA agent.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.550
Unless the agent

13:05.750 --> 13:07.880
is an existential threat
to their business.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.920
Mike Kemp's been
providing Europol

13:10.120 --> 13:12.550
with intel
on their traffic operations,

13:12.750 --> 13:15.720
which recently led
the Dutch authorities

13:15.920 --> 13:19.130
to three cocaine shipments
worth 170 million euros

13:19.330 --> 13:21.030
that were intercepted
at the Rotterdam port.

13:21.230 --> 13:22.260
- If you can't control
the ports,

13:22.460 --> 13:24.130
you can't be
Europe's prominent dealer.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.600
I'll reach out to the DEA's
European regional director.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.870
He'll have
a better understanding

13:28.070 --> 13:29.370
of the investigation
Kemp's spearheading.

13:29.570 --> 13:30.970
He has a heart condition?

13:31.170 --> 13:33.610
Wouldn't he have had regular
physicals to be in the DEA?

13:33.810 --> 13:35.540
He was poisoned.

13:35.740 --> 13:37.850
The syringe contains
benzodiazepine,

13:38.050 --> 13:39.680
a schedule four
controlled substance

13:39.880 --> 13:41.450
used for anesthesia
and procedural sedation.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.620
- He wasn't having
cardiac issues.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.550
- Any prints?
- Wiped clean.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.960
- I saw the paramedics give him
an injection on the tarmac,

13:48.160 --> 13:49.760
but he collapsed on the plane.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.190
- A reversal agent would've
caused him to wake up.

13:52.390 --> 13:55.130
- Needle spiking is used to
administer date rape drugs,

13:55.330 --> 13:58.230
but those effects wear off
in a few hours.

13:58.430 --> 13:59.940
The fake paramedics
were administering

14:00.140 --> 14:01.700
another dose
to keep him sedated.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.910
- I'll track down
the airport CCTV footage.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.070
See if we can
get a look at them

14:05.270 --> 14:07.040
through the ambulance
windshield.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.980
- Hold on. If the original dose
was administered on the plane,

14:10.180 --> 14:12.180
that means our spiker's
still inside the hanger.

14:12.380 --> 14:14.820
- Seems pretty careless to
write "bomb" on the mirror

14:15.020 --> 14:16.890
then toss the syringe
in the trash.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.720
- The spiker must've thought
they'd be long gone

14:18.920 --> 14:20.860
by the time someone figured out
Kemp was missing.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.160
But how'd they get it
through security?

14:24.360 --> 14:26.330
- They'd have to declare it.
- I'll call TSA in New York.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.960
Get a list of declared items.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.500
- I'll talk to the air marshal.
Maybe he was forwarded a list.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.070
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

14:34.270 --> 14:38.410
<i>* *</i>

14:48.920 --> 14:50.450
How long is this going to be?

14:50.650 --> 14:52.090
This is draining.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.700
- Let me ask you a question.
Were you provided a list

15:02.900 --> 15:04.070
of controlled substances

15:04.270 --> 15:06.200
and restricted items
declared to TSA?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.170
- Did you find a lead
or a suspect?

15:09.370 --> 15:10.710
- You know
I can't tell you that.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.240
- Could be more helpful if
your team just looped me in--

15:12.440 --> 15:15.840
- I just need the list.
- I'm not trying to interfere.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.710
I'll go look through my bag.
I might have a hard copy.

15:33.730 --> 15:35.760
You find my dad yet?

15:35.960 --> 15:37.470
Not yet.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.740
Maybe they killed him.

15:44.940 --> 15:47.910
- [sighs]
At Quantico,

15:48.110 --> 15:51.380
I learned about
the importance of evidence.

15:51.580 --> 15:54.420
It eliminates confusion.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.920
Assumptions are dangerous

15:59.120 --> 16:03.060
because they're made
when there's no proof.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.760
Let's focus on
the evidence, Tyler.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.560
Did your dad communicate

16:07.760 --> 16:09.160
directly with any
of the passengers?

16:09.360 --> 16:11.930
- [chuckles]
Just everyone.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.270
- Anyone who stood out?
Seemed suspicious?

16:18.440 --> 16:20.010
Oh, my God.

16:20.210 --> 16:23.310
The bomb and the heart attack
was just to get to him?

16:23.510 --> 16:25.150
- When did he start having
his medical emergency?

16:25.350 --> 16:27.220
- After everyone started
freaking out about the bomb.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.150
- Did he eat anything?
Drink anything?

16:29.350 --> 16:32.120
- We ate at the terminal
before the flight.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.060
Chicken sandwich, some fries.
He had a beer.

16:35.260 --> 16:38.960
- Nothing on the plane?
- No.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.630
Let me see your phone.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.170
- In case the captors
reach out?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.140
When I was younger,

16:52.340 --> 16:56.150
I overheard stories about
Kiki Camarena,

16:56.340 --> 17:00.920
the only DEA agent
ever to be kidnapped.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.150
Guadalajara Cartel, they, um...

17:05.350 --> 17:08.460
they interrogated him,
beat him,

17:08.660 --> 17:11.390
even brought in a doctor
to continue the torture.

17:14.430 --> 17:17.330
I used to have nightmares
about my dad not coming home,

17:17.530 --> 17:21.500
and now...

17:21.700 --> 17:23.840
Remember the evidence.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.270
Yeah. Right.

17:28.780 --> 17:32.050
- Air Marshal Shaw gave me the
list of items declared at TSA.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.980
Three passengers were allowed
syringes for diabetes.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.350
Theo Vlachos, Erin Everett,
Marci Winston,

17:37.550 --> 17:40.920
and David Boyd
declared a benzodiazepine.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.160
- Theo Vlachos,
financial advisor in Athens.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.400
Erin Everett,
psychiatrist from Albany.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.930
Marci Winston, executive
based out of Brewster.

17:53.130 --> 17:56.470
And David Boyd,
oculoplastic surgeon.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.010
Wait. Isn't that...

17:58.210 --> 18:00.940
- The doctor who helped
Agent Kemp on the plane.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.150
- You provided medical
assistance to Mike Kemp.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.660
- Of course I did.
Never had that happen before.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.090
"Is there a doctor
in the house?"

18:16.290 --> 18:18.490
- Someone on the plane spiked
him with benzodiazepine,

18:18.690 --> 18:20.760
and as it turns out,
you're the only passenger

18:20.960 --> 18:24.130
who declared
a benzo prescription to TSA.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.970
- What?
- You heard me.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.940
<i>[tense music]</i>

18:29.140 --> 18:32.610
<i>* *</i>

18:34.580 --> 18:36.810
- Xanax.
- I'm a nervous flier.

18:37.010 --> 18:38.880
I take a pill
to sleep on flights.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.120
I--I only had half.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.650
Oh, wow. Okay.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.220
Everything's making
a lot more sense now.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.560
The guy's son thought he was
having a heart attack,

18:46.750 --> 18:49.290
so I checked his vitals
before I put him on oxygen.

18:49.490 --> 18:50.760
His pupils were dilated.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.490
That's a common side effect
of benzos.

18:52.690 --> 18:53.560
- Why didn't you say
anything earlier?

18:53.760 --> 18:56.930
- I did.
I told the paramedics.

18:57.130 --> 19:00.400
- Did anyone on the plane help
Mike besides you and his son?

19:00.600 --> 19:01.870
- One of the flight attendants,
I think.

19:02.070 --> 19:03.540
It was a very confusing
situation.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.940
People were panicked.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.990
I don't think it's him.

19:17.180 --> 19:18.790
Unless he's
an Oscar-worthy actor.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.560
- No. He seems legit.
- Record's clean.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.920
No sign of malpractice,
and the spiker would've used

19:23.120 --> 19:24.790
a benzo in liquid form,
not pills.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.800
- Agent Kemp was away
with the fairies.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.630
You couldn't sedate someone
like that with Xanax,

19:28.830 --> 19:30.570
even if it was dissolved
to make it injectable.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.900
- Vo, look into
the flight attendant.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.370
- Already did,
and witnesses confirmed

19:33.570 --> 19:34.600
that he never used
the rear lavatory.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.940
I briefed Sergeant Fassi

19:36.140 --> 19:37.970
on Agent Kemp's
suspected abduction.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.110
- We're prepared to shut down
the borders if necessary.

19:40.310 --> 19:42.980
- Okay, what do we got so far
on airport cams?

19:43.180 --> 19:44.980
- Plates were reported stolen
two weeks ago.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.080
Registered to a catering
company in TÃ©touan.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.320
Faces were obscured by

19:48.520 --> 19:49.720
the sun's reflection
in the windshield.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.050
- Locating the ambulance
will be nearly impossible.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.160
Northern Morocco doesn't have
public video surveillance

19:54.360 --> 19:56.160
- like Casablanca.
- This feels like a broken web.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.030
- What else do we got?
- Nothing on Tyler's phone.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.730
- How does a passenger working
for the Mocro Mafia

20:01.930 --> 20:04.130
bypass security
and get a needle on a plane?

20:04.330 --> 20:06.100
- U.S. air marshals
have the capability

20:06.300 --> 20:08.340
to bypass security checks.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.110
- All right, I want to know
everything about this guy--

20:10.300 --> 20:12.340
financials, assets,
flight assignments,

20:12.540 --> 20:15.010
what kind of toilet paper
he uses to wipe his ass with.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.810
- There is a DEA director here
to see Agent Forrester.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.620
- Yeah.
[phone chimes]

20:27.960 --> 20:29.420
What?

20:29.620 --> 20:31.630
Nothing.

20:38.630 --> 20:39.700
Rick Larson.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.600
We spoke during
Operation Trojan Shield.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.270
I'm the DEA European
regional director.

20:44.470 --> 20:45.610
- I remember you.
It's nice to put

20:45.810 --> 20:47.140
- a name to a face.
- Likewise.

20:47.340 --> 20:49.040
I wish it wasn't under these
circumstances.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.850
- Tell me about it.
What we know so far,

20:52.050 --> 20:53.580
Agent Kemp was heavily sedated,

20:53.780 --> 20:56.020
abducted by two men
posing as paramedics.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.320
What we don't have is
a clear motive.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.720
I'm not gonna lie.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.320
We're swimming in
dark waters here.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.130
If the Mocro Mafia is involved,

21:04.320 --> 21:06.460
this isn't solely about
Agent Kemp's intel

21:06.660 --> 21:09.400
on the ports.
It's about names.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.900
Identities of
undercover DEA agents.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.900
Networks of CIs in Morocco
and the EU.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.410
Intelligence personnel,
key witnesses in the US.

21:18.610 --> 21:22.040
A lot of lives will be at risk
if they put the wood to him.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.810
But he's been trained
to withstand torture.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.680
- Every man has
his breaking point.

a military jet as a precaution.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.440
What about Athens?

37:27.640 --> 37:29.480
I mean, we don't have
to do any tours.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.010
We can just get a hotel,
get room service,

37:31.210 --> 37:33.110
- whatever you want to do.
- No.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.150
No, I think the vacation's
over, buddy.

37:35.350 --> 37:36.620
We're going home.

37:36.820 --> 37:38.190
- You want to go back
to the Netherlands?

37:38.390 --> 37:40.920
- No. Home-home.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.760
I put in for a transfer
to New York.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.400
Which was approved.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.530
- Yeah, I sacrificed
enough time

37:50.730 --> 37:52.930
away from you and our family.

37:53.130 --> 37:55.070
I'm not gonna let
another 12 years pass

37:55.270 --> 37:57.370
watching your life
on my phone screen.

38:31.670 --> 38:33.910
Yup. Oh, yeah. Of course.

38:34.110 --> 38:36.310
Jamie, just, uh, yeah.
Just give me a second.

38:36.510 --> 38:37.780
- Is there something--

Hey.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.720
Where you going?

38:50.920 --> 38:52.530
- It just seems like
you got a lot going on.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.530
No. No, no, no.

[speaks Hungarian]

38:58.330 --> 39:00.330
This is my sister Vera.

39:00.530 --> 39:03.870
We had a little disagreement
over the recipe.

39:04.070 --> 39:05.740
- Nice to meet you, Jamie.
- Hi.

39:05.940 --> 39:08.440
- This guy can't cook
to save his life.

39:11.110 --> 39:13.510
- Bye. See you tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

39:13.710 --> 39:14.820
Bye.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.420
[mouths words]

39:17.620 --> 39:19.750
- Come in.
- Thanks.

39:25.060 --> 39:27.630
As it turns out, I cannot cook
or bake with one hand.

39:27.830 --> 39:30.130
[chuckles]
Thank you.

39:30.330 --> 39:32.370
Uh, my sister insisted on
her recipe,

39:32.570 --> 39:35.800
which would have been
a candle wax version,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.370
as you described it.

39:39.570 --> 39:42.310
Come on. Tell me how I did.

39:42.510 --> 39:47.050
On a scale of one to ten.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.880
Hmm.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.160
Oh, my God. Did I...

40:00.360 --> 40:01.760
I'm kidding.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.460
Light and fluffy.

40:03.660 --> 40:07.000
A rich glaze.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.440
I give it a solid 11
for effort.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.140
- Nice. It's a good thing we
have more in the kitchen then.

40:13.340 --> 40:14.510
Mm.
