00:01.566 --> 00:03.394
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.438 --> 00:05.527
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:05.570 --> 00:08.182
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

00:08.225 --> 00:09.531
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.228
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior

00:11.272 --> 00:13.709
and criminals,
which was so successful

00:13.752 --> 00:16.668
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.279
That's when the
New York Police Department

00:18.322 --> 00:20.107
reached out to me
to help catch him.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.978
Which I did, so they hired me,

00:22.022 --> 00:23.545
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.460
So now I'm working
with this woman,

00:25.503 --> 00:27.114
Detective Lizzie Needham

00:27.157 --> 00:29.464
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.248
Looks like I need a new name.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.989
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

00:36.123 --> 00:38.125
♪

00:52.574 --> 00:54.880
Hello?

00:54.924 --> 00:57.057
Celia?

00:57.100 --> 00:59.059
Is anybody here?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.323
Oh, my God. Celia!

01:02.366 --> 01:04.325
I think it's great
you want to start

01:04.368 --> 01:06.370
making healthy,
organic dinners.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.764
I think it's great you're
willing to make them with me.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.853
And, you know, since they
give you all the ingredients,

01:10.896 --> 01:13.334
it's-it's... you know,
it's super easy, too.
Mmm.

01:13.377 --> 01:14.944
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Call from Joan Ross.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.424
Let it go to voice mail.

01:16.467 --> 01:17.990
Why? It's Joan.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.340
Yes, but it's 9:00.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.602
She should be relaxing
and having fun.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.603
Like us.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.387
Yeah.

01:23.431 --> 01:25.389
Besides, she'll want
to press me on my book,

01:25.433 --> 01:27.217
and I'm just not in the mood
for a lecture

01:27.261 --> 01:30.220
when I tell her
I'm only on... page three.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.569
Mm-hmm.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.180
I'm thinking about
giving back my advance.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.268
Is this about your father?

01:34.311 --> 01:35.182
No.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.357
Maybe.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.401
Yes.

01:37.445 --> 01:38.837
He's wrong, okay?

01:38.881 --> 01:40.361
You have more
than one book in you.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.231
Get him out of your head.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.279
You know what would help?
Food.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.150
How much longer
until dinner is ready?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.151
You mean the meal
that's supposed

01:48.195 --> 01:49.283
to take 15 minutes to make?

01:49.326 --> 01:50.371
At least another hour.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.288
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Call from Elizabeth Needham.Oh.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.074
Hey, Lizzie. What are you doing
still at work?

01:58.118 --> 02:01.164
We've been assigned a new case--
an attempted murder.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.035
Oh. Um, text me the address.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.907
I'm on my way.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.344
We're cooking dinner,
but between us, it's probably

02:07.388 --> 02:08.954
a good time to leave.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.652
Seriously, how much
more chopping?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.175
Everything okay over there?

02:12.219 --> 02:13.568
Well, I hope so,
because I'm leaving.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.526
I'll pick up dinner
on the way.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.224
Uh...

02:17.267 --> 02:19.313
Oh, don't worry about food.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.966
I got you covered.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.229
You sure?

02:23.926 --> 02:25.710
Yep, you're good.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.147
See you soon.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.410
Great.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.368
This is you having
me covered?

02:31.412 --> 02:33.414
You brought me stale,
hard doughnuts.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.719
Some people
would call them scones,

02:34.763 --> 02:36.286
and they'd be happy.

02:36.330 --> 02:39.724
Uh, and some people would
be wrong and hungry.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.378
You owe me dinner.

02:41.422 --> 02:42.466
And possibly dental work.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.033
Hey.Here you go.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.730
Thanks.

02:45.774 --> 02:48.603
MAN: Yeah, I just arrived.
We were supposed to have dinner.

02:48.646 --> 02:49.734
[conversation continues
indistinctly]

02:49.778 --> 02:51.301
LIZZIE:
Ms. Baxter?

02:51.345 --> 02:52.911
I'm Detective Needham.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.392
This is my partner,
Dr. Reinhart.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.741
Hello.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.047
We'd like to ask you a couple

02:58.090 --> 02:59.396
of questions
if you're up to it.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.311
Ask away.
The sooner I give my statement,

03:01.355 --> 03:04.358
the sooner you can find
this freak and put him in jail.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.276
Any idea who attacked you?

03:09.319 --> 03:11.887
A monster.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.410
I was, uh...

03:13.454 --> 03:15.107
I was at my computer.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.805
I got stuck
in the last chapter,

03:16.848 --> 03:18.589
which is where I've been
for way too long.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.462
I needed a break,
so I went to the kitchen

03:21.505 --> 03:22.463
to get something to drink.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.812
And that's when I saw him.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.467
He was, um...

03:26.510 --> 03:28.860
He was wearing
a strange animal mask

03:28.904 --> 03:31.123
and a... what seemed to be a...

03:31.167 --> 03:32.473
an expensive suit.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.823
It was well tailored.

03:34.866 --> 03:38.305
He, um...
he was holding a knife.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.220
A hunting knife.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.353
But you don't know who he was

03:43.397 --> 03:44.833
or why he attacked you?No.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.356
Any enemies?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.531
Other than
late-night carbs

03:47.575 --> 03:49.403
and most forms
of exercise, no.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.448
LIZZIE: Do you have
a security system?

03:51.492 --> 03:52.493
Yeah, I-I have a smart home.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.495
My alarm should
have been working.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.541
I tried to get away from him.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.543
So, other than the suit,

03:59.587 --> 04:01.371
the mask and the knife,
what else can you

04:01.415 --> 04:02.546
tell us about your assailant?

04:02.590 --> 04:05.767
He was, uh, five-ten.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.248
Fit.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.162
About 175 pounds.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.774
If it weren't for Geoff,
I-I would be dead.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.428
He's your publisher?
No.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.256
He's the publisher
who wants my next book,

04:16.299 --> 04:17.648
Birdie in Bermuda.

04:17.692 --> 04:21.173
It was his arrival
that scared off my attacker.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.566
Why do you look
so familiar?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.960
What... what is your name again?

04:25.003 --> 04:26.222
Dylan Reinhart.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.658
You wrote Freaks.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.573
You're that abnormal
psych professor

04:29.617 --> 04:30.748
who now consults for the NYPD.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.273
Uh, yeah. That's me.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.362
I loved your book.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.973
And you write
the Birdie Baines Mysteries.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.802
You read them?Well, I will now.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.282
What else have you written

04:42.325 --> 04:43.674
besides Freaks?

04:43.718 --> 04:46.373
Uh... just that.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.070
Well, I thought you had
another book coming out.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.376
So did I.

Oh, no. Writer's block?

05:00.822 --> 05:02.519
Oh, one more question.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.739
You keep referring
to your attacker as a man.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.741
How are you so sure
it was a he?

05:06.784 --> 05:09.134
Because he spoke to me.What did he say?

05:10.527 --> 05:13.225
He said, "Bye-bye, Birdie."

05:27.370 --> 05:29.372

So, Celia Baxter called me.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.612
Oh. Well, I did sing
your praises.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.962
Well, she wants me
to edit her next book.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.833
We're meeting for lunch
on Friday.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.748
That's nice.It's not nice at all.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.446
It's a miracle,
considering my history with her.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.883
You know, I passed
on her first book.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.841
Look, I cannot
rep you, okay?

06:03.885 --> 06:05.190
I hate the beginning,

06:05.234 --> 06:07.149
I hate the middle,
and I hate the end.

06:07.192 --> 06:10.544
And I-I have to tell you,
this title, I hate it, too.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.372
It's boring, Celia.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.199
Oh, God. I know how
harsh you can be.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.984
No, I wasn't harsh.
I was honest.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.855
You know, and who knew
she was going to go on

06:17.899 --> 06:19.248

best seller?

06:19.291 --> 06:20.945
Well, not you.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.078
Yeah, clearly not.
But I want to say thank you.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.036
Because you're here,
and you're saving lives,

06:25.080 --> 06:26.777
and you get me
new clients.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.213
You're welcome.I actually thought

06:28.257 --> 06:29.519
you were trying to avoid me,

06:29.563 --> 06:31.173
you know, not talking
about the new book

06:31.216 --> 06:32.696
and everything, but...

06:36.657 --> 06:38.136
What is this?

06:38.180 --> 06:40.617

ran it through a baby diaper.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.199
I can't read.Zack.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.548
See if you can find
a reason why anyone

06:58.592 --> 07:01.072
would want to hurt Birdie
or her creator, Celia.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.247
It may be someone delusional.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.292
Someone who can't differentiate

07:03.335 --> 07:04.946
between fiction
and reality.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.295
Someone who
thinks Birdie's

07:06.338 --> 07:07.688
sending them messages--

07:07.731 --> 07:09.080
messages they don't
want or like.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.779
FUCCI: Here's a rendering
of your perp.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.476
I also checked the database
for crimes committed

07:13.520 --> 07:15.173
by somebody
wearing a weird mask

07:15.217 --> 07:17.349
and a handmade suit,
but the database said,

07:17.393 --> 07:18.568
"What are you, nuts?"

07:18.612 --> 07:20.527
See if you can find anywhere

07:20.570 --> 07:22.659
that sells these types of masks.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.183
Sosa, anything
on Celia's fan site?

07:25.227 --> 07:27.272
Uh, some troll's upset the next
Birdie mystery is overdue,

07:27.316 --> 07:28.926
but no one wants
to murder her.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.145
Any luck with the shoe print?

07:30.188 --> 07:32.190
Yes. It's from
a John Lobb collection.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.366
An English loafer
worn by every wealthy man

07:34.410 --> 07:35.672
in the tri-state area.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.327
Along with a bespoke suit.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.502
Hey.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.722
If you put a mask on,

07:41.765 --> 07:43.158
we could be
talking about you.

07:43.201 --> 07:46.117
His outfit contrasts
with the use of a mask,

07:46.161 --> 07:50.208
yet still conveys a level
of sophistication and class.

07:50.252 --> 07:53.429
Whoever attacked Celia is very
comfortable with themselves.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.170
And very sick.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.606
Hey, Needham. Great news.

07:56.650 --> 07:59.043
You got a lead on my perp?Charlie's been chosen

07:59.087 --> 08:00.523
to be awarded
the NYPD Medal of Honor

08:00.567 --> 08:02.569
for his work on Op C-47.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.832

plenty of time

08:09.706 --> 08:11.099
to write your speech.You kidding?

08:11.142 --> 08:12.666
That's great news.
That's the highest order

08:12.709 --> 08:14.232
of recognition.ZACK: Yeah, guys
still talk

08:14.276 --> 08:15.799
about the dent he
made on the cartel,

08:15.843 --> 08:17.584
how they won't even
go back to the docks.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.324
No one deserves it
more than Charlie.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.630
I'll never forget that night.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.199
Oh.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.548
DNA results are back.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.289
Thanks, Harris. Uh...

08:27.332 --> 08:30.248
One is a mystery,
one is Celia Baxter's,

08:30.292 --> 08:32.250
but there's a hit on the third.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.557
A man named Ben Richfield.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.298
I do know Ben Richfield.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.648
He was my writing professor
years ago.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.128
Have you seen him recently?

08:40.171 --> 08:41.521
Uh, actually, yes, I did.

08:41.564 --> 08:44.132
I ran into him a while ago
at a coffee shop.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.613
Which was weird
after so many years.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.267
He was, uh, rude.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.878
Maybe even seemed
a little jealous.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.270
Well, his DNA
was found on the knife.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.359
We're on our way
to talk to him now.

08:55.926 --> 08:58.363
All right, I'm almost home.
Will you call me later?

08:58.407 --> 09:00.365
I hope it's the first
of many conversations.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.106
Me, too.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.850
Why don't you want to accept
the award for Charlie?

09:08.025 --> 09:09.244
I never...

09:09.287 --> 09:10.637
I never said that.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.856
No, but the pitch
of your voice went up

09:12.900 --> 09:14.336
when Harris mentioned it.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.599
And then your eyes started
to dart back and forth.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.080
Well, I've been doing that
since Shakespearean times.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.385
You're upset and unnerved.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.214
Something else is going on,
and I am concerned.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.304
We're early for Richfield.
Sit down.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.437
The doctor is in session.

09:34.356 --> 09:37.272
After Charlie died,
I shut down.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.667
My family thought
it was shock or grief.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.407
So did I, honestly.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.018
And then a police shrink
convinced me

09:44.061 --> 09:46.498
that I had survivor's guilt.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.545
But my guilt
didn't go away.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.332
It-it was mixed
with doubts and suspicion.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.160
Suspicion about Charlie?

09:56.204 --> 09:58.554
I'm the only one
who feels this way.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.774
And I hate myself
for doubting him,

10:00.817 --> 10:04.647
but that mission
went so wrong so fast.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.520
I guess I'm afraid...

10:08.564 --> 10:12.916
Charlie might have been
playing both sides.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.354
Or worse-- that he
was just plain dirty.

10:16.398 --> 10:19.836
And now you may have to accept
an award on his behalf.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.142
In public.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.665
I can't lie.

10:22.709 --> 10:26.234
Not to anyone,
especially not my team.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.540
I just need to know the truth.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.152
I've put out some feelers
to see if I can find

10:31.195 --> 10:32.632
Charlie's old
criminal informant,

10:32.675 --> 10:35.417
Rodrigo Salinas. He was
imbedded in the cartel,

10:35.460 --> 10:38.072
and he was in the warehouse
when Charlie was killed.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.595
But then he vanished.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.250
If I can draw him out,
maybe he'll...

10:42.293 --> 10:44.382
tell me what
really happened that night.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.732
You sure that's wise?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.647
He sounds like he could
be a dangerous guy.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.303
LIZZIE: Ben Richfield.
He has arrived.

10:52.347 --> 10:55.393
Bespoke suit, designer shoes.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.614
Awards, trophies, posters.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.746
He's very successful.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.051
And very rude.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.662
How long are we
supposed to wait?

11:02.705 --> 11:04.141
I don't know.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.187
How long does it take
to do a phone interview

11:06.230 --> 11:07.710
and have your
nails buffed?

11:07.754 --> 11:10.365
Did you notice he also
seems to like weird masks?

11:10.408 --> 11:11.583
Mm-hmm.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.542
Sorry to have kept you waiting,
but, uh...

11:13.585 --> 11:15.500
I do have answers
to your questions.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.633
Ben does know
Celia Walker.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.853
She was a student
of his years ago.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.550
Has he seen her recently?

11:21.593 --> 11:23.987
Uh, yeah. In a coffee shop
a couple of months ago.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.642
Uh, he almost
walked past her.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.992
Oh, and he added
that her book jackets

11:29.036 --> 11:30.951
are really Photoshopped.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.604
Mm-hmm. Does he
know that Celia

11:32.648 --> 11:34.215
was attacked
in her home last night?

11:34.258 --> 11:36.521
Uh, he didn't say.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.307
Where was he last night?BEN: At my desk.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.570
I write from 6:00 to 12:00
every night.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.528
This is well known.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.400
He talks about it
extensively in his book,

11:45.443 --> 11:46.793
Pen Like Ben.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.102
Did you try to kill
Celia Baxter last night?

11:52.146 --> 11:53.582
What did you tell them?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.671
I-I didn't say anything.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.760
Mr. Richfield, let's just
save us all a lot of time.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.632
I need to see if you have
any cuts or scratches on you.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.547
Would you mind rolling up
your sleeves, please?

12:02.591 --> 12:04.549
Not without a warrant.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.726
Now, would you excuse me?

12:06.769 --> 12:09.380
♪

12:14.734 --> 12:16.083
Thank you for meeting me.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.954
I leave for D.C.
in 20 minutes.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.521
What's the emergency?

12:19.564 --> 12:20.783
Charlie Pavlik.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.611
Your new partner's
former partner

12:22.654 --> 12:24.439
and fiancé.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.919
You told me to stop digging.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.572
Why the sudden curiosity?

12:27.616 --> 12:29.009
Lizzie's started
to question his actions

12:29.052 --> 12:30.532
when they were undercover.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.316
Also, you never stop digging.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.622
You know me so well.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.624
Tell me everything.

12:35.667 --> 12:38.670
C-47 was one of
the riskiest operations

12:38.714 --> 12:41.630
ever attempted by the NYPD.

12:41.673 --> 12:45.808
Charlie tried to infiltrate
a cartel run by Emilio Frantio,

12:45.852 --> 12:48.593
one of the world's most
ruthless drug lords.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.639
Is he connected
to Rodrigo Salinas?

12:50.682 --> 12:53.250
Charlie's informant? Yes.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.775
Rodrigo was Emilio's
most trusted confidante.

12:55.818 --> 12:59.126
Then you must know that Rodrigo
was an eyewitness that night.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.606
Lizzie's determined
to find him, to talk to him.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.434
I need you to find him first.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.785
You're concerned
about her safety.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.787
No doubt there were
dangerous elements involved

13:07.830 --> 13:09.701
in the operation
that got Charlie killed.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.268
Very dangerous.

13:11.312 --> 13:16.317
But Rodrigo's gone to ground,
disappeared.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.494
If I can't find him,
no one can.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.848
♪

13:25.892 --> 13:28.068
I'm calling on behalf of Gary.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.070
I need to get a message
to Rodrigo.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.854
Hi.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.290
Here's the thing about Ben.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.857
He's quite clearly
a narcissist.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.685
And narcissists have
very dangerous personalities.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.687
They are wound collectors.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.036
A narcissist
might hide his face

13:40.080 --> 13:41.516
during a crime
to protect himself,

13:41.559 --> 13:43.692
but also he might want
the victim to see him.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.259
Do you see why I'm perplexed?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.043
Follow me.
We'll get some answers.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.871
Where were you, anyway?

13:48.915 --> 13:51.352
Oh, I had a thing.
Um, where are we going?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.267
Harris and Zack
just caught a case.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.790
A woman was killed
two nights ago

13:54.834 --> 13:55.965
by a masked intruder.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.358
The night before Celia?

13:57.401 --> 13:58.750
And the same
M.O. as Celia?

Seems like it.
Uh, she was found

14:00.491 --> 14:02.624
this morning
by her housekeeper. Oh.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.191
Oh, Zack just sent
security footage

14:04.234 --> 14:06.280
from the crime scene.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.767
Whoa.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.559
Victim is Renata Pendell.
Stabbed 31 times.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.430
M.E. said five
of the wounds were fatal.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.518
What about the neighbors?

14:27.562 --> 14:28.911
Anyone hear anything?

14:28.955 --> 14:31.000
No. We're still
canvassing.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.655
31 times.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.222
That sort of brutal overkill

14:35.265 --> 14:37.311
suggests Renata was targeted,
uh, subject of...

14:37.354 --> 14:38.529
ZACK:
Careful.

14:38.573 --> 14:39.922
...rage.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.924
Wow. I can see
why you're having trouble

14:41.968 --> 14:45.058
getting started
on your next book.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.539
The angle of the wounds

14:48.583 --> 14:50.454
suggests her attacker
was on top of her.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.935
Maybe the rage
was fueled by impotence.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.023
What better way to dominate

14:54.067 --> 14:55.807
than to force
your victim to face you?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.809
If we're lucky,
she scratched him

14:57.853 --> 14:59.202
and we'll get some DNA.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.813
So, if the DNA here is Ben's

15:01.857 --> 15:03.772
and the mystery DNA
found at Celia's

15:03.815 --> 15:05.382
turns out to be Renata's...

15:05.426 --> 15:07.907
Then we can place Ben at both
crime scenes and arrest him.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.560
Hmm.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.128
His name
is Ben Richfield.

15:12.172 --> 15:13.738
I think, yeah,

15:13.782 --> 15:15.566
that could be him.But you're not sure?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.568
I tried not to pay
too much attention,

15:17.612 --> 15:18.961
but Renata's boyfriend
was definitely

15:19.005 --> 15:20.963
a well-dressed
middle-aged dude.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.009
Anything else you can tell us
about Renata?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.488
Said she was a writer,

15:24.532 --> 15:26.882
but she spent most
of her days at the gym.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.362
Or shopping.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.885
Thank you.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.930
Sure.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.455
Renata signed up
for a writing seminar

15:34.498 --> 15:36.109
with Ben Richfield's company
eight months ago.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.588
We found a payment receipt,

15:37.632 --> 15:39.460
along with a
short story she wrote.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.245
So two writers,
both female,

15:42.289 --> 15:44.334
both attacked within
48 hours of each other.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.467
First Renata,
then Celia.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.121
Celia was published.
Was Renata?

15:48.164 --> 15:50.906
Not even a blog. But I was able
to unlock her phone.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.735
A bunch of texts sent to
the same person, Ben Richfield.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.172
"I know what you did
to JF, SG and CB.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.044
"And now you did it to me.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.395
If you don't want the world
to know, we should talk."

16:01.438 --> 16:03.571
CB could be Celia Baxter.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.094
Thanks, Zack.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.705
So, Renata was trying to
blackmail Ben Richfield?

16:07.749 --> 16:10.056
Maybe Ben was trying
to kill people from his past.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.232
People who knew something
damaging about him.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.233
But what?

16:13.276 --> 16:15.496
And who are JF and SG?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.672
And are they even
still alive?

16:18.934 --> 16:21.023
I'll get a rush
on the DNA.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.851
I'll see what
Celia knows.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.940
CELIA :
I'm so sorry.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.421
I-I don't know
a Renata Pendell.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.727
What about the
texts Renata sent?

16:29.771 --> 16:32.121
Well, um...

16:32.165 --> 16:35.733
JF and SG could be
Julia Fleet and Siri Goodman.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.387
The three of us took

16:37.431 --> 16:38.736
an advanced writing
seminar from Ben.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.042
But that was years ago.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
Maybe Ben's doing
the same thing

16:42.088 --> 16:43.959
to Renata in the present.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.570
Any reason why Renata
would have blackmailed him?

16:47.876 --> 16:49.051
Ben had a reputation

16:49.095 --> 16:51.227
for stealing
his students' ideas.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.100
A fiction piece he wrote
for The New Yorker

16:54.143 --> 16:56.537
was supposedly plagiarized
from a piece

16:56.580 --> 16:58.060
that Julia had written.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.149
And there were rumors
that he took

17:00.193 --> 17:01.455
a treatment
Siri had written,

17:01.498 --> 17:03.065
changed the protagonist
to a male

17:03.109 --> 17:04.240
and sold it to Paramount.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.330
Did he ever steal anything
from you?

17:07.374 --> 17:08.375
Kind of.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.159
I was aware of his reputation,

17:10.203 --> 17:13.119
so I wrote this crazy story
about bounty-hunting sisters

17:13.162 --> 17:14.946
in a postapocalyptic world.

17:14.990 --> 17:18.428
He took it and changed it
to one sexy vampire.

17:18.472 --> 17:22.650
But that's the subject
of Ben's massive TV franchise.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.565
Doesn't that bother you?

17:24.608 --> 17:27.524
If someone stole one
of my ideas, if I had any...

17:27.568 --> 17:30.745
I was never going to be happy
writing about vampires.

17:30.788 --> 17:34.053
I write from my heart,
not for my wallet.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.359
I'm just...
I'm just really stuck

17:36.403 --> 17:38.187
on the ending of my last book.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.014
Last?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.885
Latest.

17:40.929 --> 17:44.063
You could cut yourself
some slack.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.154
It can't be easy
fighting cancer.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.112
How...?

17:51.461 --> 17:53.115
Unscented lotions.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.901
Chemotherapy patients
are sensitive to smell.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.816
Bowls of hard candies.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.428
Radiation treatment leaves a
metallic taste in the mouth.

18:01.471 --> 18:05.084
And I noticed the raised scar
from the chemotherapy

18:05.127 --> 18:07.521
infusaport.

18:07.564 --> 18:10.567
Scar's in the same place
as my mom's was.

18:12.308 --> 18:16.530
Uh, yeah, I'm, um...
I'm fighting cancer.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.836
My own mom was killed,

18:18.880 --> 18:21.317
along with my father
and sisters,

18:21.361 --> 18:23.232
by a drunk driver.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.278
I was an orphan at nine.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.371
I'm dedicating this book
to them.

18:31.414 --> 18:34.504
It's probably another reason
why I'm stuck.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.898
I want it to be perfect.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.726
Maybe I can help.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.293
I would love your

18:40.336 --> 18:41.990
psychological insight
into the criminal mind.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.906
Oh. Well, writers and criminals
often make the same mistake.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.604
They get caught up
in the thrill of the action.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.128
They go on too long.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.912
We don't know when to quit.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.176
Maybe Joan could help.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.182
Hmm. Good news.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.532
So, you received texts
from Renata,

19:02.576 --> 19:03.881
but you never met her?

19:03.925 --> 19:06.057
I've never been
to her building, either,

19:06.101 --> 19:07.929
much less killed her.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.845
You don't know a woman who
took one of your own courses?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.847
If she took it.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.065
Here's proof
Renata was enrolled.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.676
So what if she did?

19:15.719 --> 19:17.982
He's a rich and
prominent author.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.202
An easy target for
frustrated wannabes

19:20.246 --> 19:21.595
with delusions
of creativity

19:21.638 --> 19:23.945
who want to claim he
stole their ideas.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.207
But I don't know her.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.122
I don't know any Renata.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.733
If you leak the contents
of those texts...

19:29.777 --> 19:31.866
We'll have a defamation suit
on the commissioner's desk

19:31.909 --> 19:33.911
before the sun
goes down today.

19:33.955 --> 19:34.999
We're done here.

19:35.043 --> 19:37.088
Not so fast.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.699
Ben's blood was confirmed

19:38.742 --> 19:41.484
in both Renata's apartment
and Celia's home.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.921
Solid evidence for both
the D.A. and a jury.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.880
LIZZIE:
Ben Richfield,
you're under arrest

19:45.923 --> 19:47.273
for the murder of Renata Pendell

19:47.316 --> 19:49.318
and the attempted murder
of Celia Baxter.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.102
Are you kidding me?

19:51.146 --> 19:53.453
Right this way, sir.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.821
♪

20:34.972 --> 20:36.974
♪

21:10.051 --> 21:11.922
♪

21:13.272 --> 21:15.883
MAN:
Hola, Elizabeth.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.728
I'm not wired.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.512
I'm clean.

21:42.257 --> 21:44.477
Who are you?

21:44.520 --> 21:46.914
Rodrigo sent me.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.525
He said you'd been
reaching out.

21:49.569 --> 21:52.485
Unfortunately, he's not
in a position to meet.

21:52.528 --> 21:56.053
I want to know what happened
in the warehouse that night.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.795
Tell me what you
think happened.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.929
And then I can tell
you what Rodrigo saw.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.018
Come on.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.411
I don't have time for games.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.284
Okay, fine. Fine.

22:16.204 --> 22:19.903
It started out
like every mission-- boring.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.950
There was nothing to do
but wait.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.082
What about
Pat and Joey?

22:25.126 --> 22:26.388
Absolutely.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.911
Yeah, but if we
invite them,

22:27.955 --> 22:30.218
then we have to invite
everyone we work with.

22:30.261 --> 22:32.176
Well, so we'll
invite everyone.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.656
:
Why not?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.005
We're only getting
married once.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.051
To each other, sure.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.096
Oh, please. After everything
we've been through,

22:39.140 --> 22:40.968
I'm not doing this again.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.404
SOSA :
Heads up, everybody.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.797
Target has arrived.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.146
Ten-four.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.199
I'll see you in ten.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.984
Nine would be better.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.863
LIZZIE:
The plan was simple.

23:06.907 --> 23:10.258
Rodrigo would bring the dealer
and the heroin to a warehouse.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.607
LIZZIE :
I'm in position.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.087
Charlie would buy the drugs.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.567
SOSA:
I got eyes on the target.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.438
My partners and I
would then handle the arrest.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.222
JULIAN: Was Charlie wired? LIZZIE: Too dangerous.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.137
This was an eyes-only mission.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.530
HARRIS:
Looks like the deal is on.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.532
Turn around.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.229
All right?

23:25.273 --> 23:27.318
You gotta head
inside, man.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.103
FUCCI:
Something's wrong.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.412
Don't do it, Charlie. No.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.022
HARRIS:
They're on the move.

23:42.203 --> 23:45.989
SOSA: Target's on the move.
I'm about to lose visual.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.426
We lost him.

23:54.084 --> 23:56.304
Needham, hold your position.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.568
LIZZIE:
He's taking too long.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.092
Something's wrong.
I'm going in.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.093
No.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.094
Too dangerous.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.226
You'll blow his cover,

24:05.269 --> 24:06.445
get you both killed.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.099
Don't go.
Stay where you are.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.756
Stand down.
Backup is on the way.

24:15.149 --> 24:17.456
Shots fired. Shots fired.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.177
Officer down!

24:43.220 --> 24:44.395
Hey, baby.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.310
Hey, hey.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.138
Oh, you idiot. You weren't
supposed to go in.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.183
Why did you go in?

24:49.226 --> 24:52.403
I'm sor... I'm sor...

24:52.447 --> 24:54.144
:
No, I'm sorry.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.669
Char-Charlie.

24:56.712 --> 24:59.019
Charlie? Charlie!

24:59.062 --> 25:00.499
Someone help us!

25:00.542 --> 25:03.632
Please! Please!
Can you hear me?!

25:05.112 --> 25:06.200
Baby.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.244
Baby, please.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.508
:
Please, baby.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.599
Please.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.298
Please. Hey.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.605
What happened?

25:21.084 --> 25:22.869
Please.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.305
Please, just tell me.

25:24.348 --> 25:27.177
Two months before
this operation,

25:27.221 --> 25:30.354
an account was set up in the
Cayman Islands for Charlie.

25:31.747 --> 25:35.534
Weekly deposits were
made by the cartel.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.712
And Charlie made
significant withdrawals.

25:40.887 --> 25:43.150
So Charlie was
playing both sides?

25:43.193 --> 25:46.327
Taking money from the dealers
and working for the cops?

25:46.370 --> 25:50.026
And probably
lying to both.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.333
Which is how
he ended up...Okay.

25:52.376 --> 25:53.856
Thank you.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.971
Hey, Needham.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.341
You okay?

26:44.385 --> 26:45.952
Not really, no.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.562
It wasn't the truth
I wanted to hear,

26:47.606 --> 26:49.608
but I guess it's the
truth I needed to hear.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.566
Excuse me?Oh, come on.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.568
The agent you sent
to brief me this morning.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.614
Don't worry, he was
very, very professional.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.616
Didn't give you up,
but I'm pretty sure

26:57.659 --> 26:59.052
he wasn't sent by Rodrigo.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.749
You sent him.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.838
He's your super special
secret friend.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.840
Lizzie, I...Please don't help me again.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.713
If I need help--
and I won't-- I'll ask.

27:07.756 --> 27:10.846
You should know...I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.674
Uploaded Ben Richfield's
interrogation footage

27:12.718 --> 27:14.328
for reevaluation.

27:14.371 --> 27:15.503
You should have it.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.332
What's going on?

27:18.375 --> 27:20.334
When did we lose faith
in Ben as our perp?

27:20.377 --> 27:21.988
I did last night.

27:22.031 --> 27:25.469
The question of how Renata,
a writer with no job, uh, ever,

27:25.513 --> 27:28.429
could afford a Tribeca
apartment started to bother me.

27:28.472 --> 27:29.865
Maybe she's a trustafarian.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.388
But Renata's apartment

27:31.432 --> 27:34.348
was paid for by an LLC,
Carmichael Limited.

27:34.391 --> 27:37.220
Turns out Bruce Carmichael
was Celia Baxter's husband.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.179
They divorced nine years ago.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.876
It was not amicable.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.356
Renata was his mistress.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.271
Wait, are you
thinking Celia's ex

27:44.314 --> 27:46.186
was involved?Not likely.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.231
He's in Maui this week
teaching a real estate seminar.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.755
He has 200 alibis.

27:49.798 --> 27:51.365
Did he know Ben?

27:51.408 --> 27:52.627
Not likely, either.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.021
But I can't stop
thinking about Ben.

27:56.631 --> 27:59.503
This is the surveillance footage
from Renata's apartment.

28:04.944 --> 28:06.946
What am I missing here?

28:13.474 --> 28:15.128
Yesterday, I almost bumped

28:15.171 --> 28:16.695
into that light in the hallway.
Remember?

28:16.738 --> 28:18.000
Mm-hmm.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.741
I'm about the same
height as Ben.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.439
And so he would possibly
have bumped into it, too.

28:22.483 --> 28:23.527
LIZZIE: But in
the security footage,

28:23.571 --> 28:24.920
the killer goes
right under it.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.096
Uh, so the killer
is shorter than Ben.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.750
Much shorter than Ben.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.447
But if Renata's killer
isn't Ben,

28:30.491 --> 28:32.101
why was his blood
at both crime scenes?

28:32.145 --> 28:33.668
His DNA confirmed.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.539
Unless it's not
his blood.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.106
Maybe it's synthetic blood.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.673
BOTH:
What?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.327
I put Ben and Celia's books
on my e-reader.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.068
I know I read that term
in one of these books.

28:42.111 --> 28:43.809
Oh, seriously?
Synthetic blood?

28:43.852 --> 28:45.375
I know it sounds
like science fiction,

28:45.419 --> 28:46.855
but since the victim
and our prime suspect

28:46.899 --> 28:48.596
are both writers...ZACK: Oh. I got it.

28:49.553 --> 28:52.774
27 mentions--
"synthetic DNA."

28:55.559 --> 28:57.257
Ben Richfield had one
of his characters

28:57.300 --> 28:59.346
plant fabricated DNA
at the scene of a crime

28:59.389 --> 29:01.043
in order to frame
someone else for murder.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.871
Could that even really happen?

29:02.915 --> 29:05.874
Absolutely. It's not the stuff
of fiction at all anymore.

29:05.918 --> 29:08.964
You'd first need a DNA
sample from a carrier--

29:09.008 --> 29:11.401
say a strand of hair,
saliva from a toothbrush,

29:11.445 --> 29:13.142
even a coffee cup.

29:13.186 --> 29:16.145
Ben and Celia bumped into
each other at the coffee shop.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.495
Then what would you do?Let's say we've got

29:18.539 --> 29:20.759
Dylan's DNA from a coffee cup.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.065
We then get a blood sample
from you, Lizzie.

29:23.109 --> 29:26.155
We centrifuge out all
your white blood cells.

29:26.199 --> 29:29.376
To the remaining red cells,
we add Dylan's DNA.

29:29.419 --> 29:32.814
Now, any time that blood
is tested, only Dylan's DNA

29:32.858 --> 29:35.164
will be found.How is that possible?

29:35.208 --> 29:37.688
Because you can't find DNA
in red blood cells.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.866
What can you tell us
about the blood

29:40.909 --> 29:42.476
found on the knife
at Celia's?

29:42.519 --> 29:46.785
The person who supplied
this blood sample

29:46.828 --> 29:51.224
was likely going through
chemo or radiation therapy.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.400
Celia is being treated
for cancer.

29:53.443 --> 29:54.836
What are you thinking?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.272
That it was Celia's blood?

29:57.317 --> 29:59.406
Yeah, I think
she planted it.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.103
You're saying that she
attacked herself?

30:01.147 --> 30:03.453
You're saying
she stabbed herself?

30:03.497 --> 30:06.021
I think Celia was never
the victim of a violent attack.

30:06.065 --> 30:09.068
I think she is the author
of this entire plot.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.113
But why?

30:11.984 --> 30:13.855
Listen to Ben's opening
paragraph in Fangs.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.857
"Losing her parents and
sisters to a drunk driver

30:15.901 --> 30:18.686
"when she was nine had
changed her life forever.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.557
"Now, as she bit
into his neck,

30:20.601 --> 30:22.908
she knew it would
reverse the pain."

30:22.951 --> 30:25.214
Ben didn't just steal
one of Celia's stories.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.651
He stole the greatest
tragedy of her life.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.698
But why is Celia
committing these crimes now?

30:30.741 --> 30:32.874
I don't think she's
fighting cancer.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.789
I think she's
dying from it.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.574
Celia spent her entire
life writing crime plots,

30:37.618 --> 30:39.881
trying to find
justice in fiction.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.144
Now, as she faces death,

30:42.188 --> 30:44.277
I think her need to avenge
those who wronged her

30:44.320 --> 30:46.714
has resulted in some...

30:46.757 --> 30:48.498
diabolical bucket list.

30:48.542 --> 30:51.066
So she killed one enemy
and framed another for it.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.981
Uh-huh. The professor
who stole her past,

30:53.025 --> 30:55.070
and the mistress who
stole her future.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.811
What if there are others?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.813
You mean others who wronged her?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.293
Yes. And Joan.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.077
Joan refused to publish Celia.

31:02.121 --> 31:04.166
Was blunt with her,
as only Joan can be.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.689
Damaged Celia's confidence.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.867
Now, today,
Joan is meeting with Celia,

31:08.910 --> 31:10.781
and she's not picking up.
Come on.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.921
Joan, hey.
It's so good to see you.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.270
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

31:21.314 --> 31:22.881
Oh, there's some ice tea
in the fridge.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.404
I made it special just for you.

31:24.447 --> 31:25.927
Cool. See you in a second.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.239
Just get my assistant
on the phone.

31:33.282 --> 31:34.631
That's all I'm asking for.

31:34.675 --> 31:35.894
Fine.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.853
Hello, assistant.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.247
Listen, I need you
to do something for me.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.510
I need you to move
my 3:00 to 4:00,

31:43.553 --> 31:45.468
my 4:00 to 5:00,

31:45.512 --> 31:48.515
and my 5:00 to 6:00.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.299
Actually, my 6:00 to never.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.475
Yeah, I know who it is.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.042
Look, I don't want
to talk to her.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.652
Can you do it?

31:55.696 --> 31:57.480
So, you just handle it, okay?

31:57.524 --> 32:00.092
All right, baby.
Thank you. Bye.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.702
Jeezy

32:07.838 --> 32:09.275
What the hell?

32:09.318 --> 32:11.581
You couldn't just yell,
"Drop the glass"?

32:11.625 --> 32:13.583
You've got to answer your phone
when people call you.

32:13.627 --> 32:15.237
What?LIZZIE: Ms. Ross.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.412
Where's Celia?

32:16.456 --> 32:17.631
Uh, upstairs, I guess.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.024
What is going on?

32:19.067 --> 32:21.069
We came to save you.From lunch?

32:21.113 --> 32:22.070
From Celia.
She's very dangerous.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.376
She may be trying to kill you.

32:23.419 --> 32:24.986
What?
I know, I know.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.901
It's complicated, but look,
just put that down.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.164
I-I know. All I want you
to do right now

32:29.208 --> 32:30.992
is wait outside
for the police,

32:31.036 --> 32:32.428
and I will explain
everything later.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.474
You're gonna be
okay, okay?
Okay.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.305
Lizzie, are you okay?

32:39.348 --> 32:41.002
LIZZIE:
I'm good.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.579
CELIA: "Dylan, thanks
for helping me finish.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.885
Now, go write your next book."

32:58.977 --> 33:00.717
LIZZIE:
Look what I found.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.546
Any sign of Celia?

33:03.590 --> 33:04.895
I tossed the place.
She's not here.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.071
What's that?

33:07.246 --> 33:09.335
The answers to this mystery.

33:13.339 --> 33:16.864
Celia spent months
planning her revenge.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.827
Procuring the DNA
from the coffee cup.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.573
Acquiring the synthetic blood.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.012
To place on Renata.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.669
And getting her revenge.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.065
Then she planted the evidence.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.983
Wrote her own final chapter.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.378
Staged the attack at her home.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.641
And framed Ben.

33:58.427 --> 34:01.213
It would be the best story
she ever told.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.258
And it all started with us.

34:03.302 --> 34:05.521
The statement Celia
initially gave us was fiction.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.958
Oh, it was a complete
and total lie.
Hello?

34:08.002 --> 34:09.873
CELIA: Lucky for Joan,
you destroyed that ice tea.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.875
:
It's her.

34:11.919 --> 34:13.747
What was it?

34:13.790 --> 34:15.531
Arsenic
Strychnine?

34:15.575 --> 34:17.577
Yes.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.100
Where are you?

34:19.144 --> 34:20.797
Hopefully nowhere
you can find me.Put it on speaker.

34:20.841 --> 34:22.190
Anyway, I want
to say good-bye.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.454
You weren't my friend
long enough.

34:25.498 --> 34:28.153
Is it true
what they say about revenge?

34:28.196 --> 34:29.937
Was it worth it?

34:29.980 --> 34:31.547
It was.

34:31.591 --> 34:34.115
Every last drop.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.900
A wave of Dostoyevsky-like
remorse is about to hit you.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.511
Oh, I already feel remorse.

34:38.554 --> 34:39.903
Remorse that Ben
isn't in jail.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.949
Fangswas my best,

34:41.992 --> 34:45.300
my most personal idea.

34:45.344 --> 34:48.521
The only time the writing gods
spoke directly to me,

34:48.564 --> 34:49.957
and he stole it.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.698
Ruined it.

34:51.741 --> 34:54.135
I had to wait years
for my next idea to come.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.659
For the gods to speak
to me again.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.879
Birdie.

34:58.922 --> 35:01.360
And now she won't get the life
she wants, either.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.362
Celia, I am gonna
hunt you down.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.886
I'm starting the extradition
paperwork immediately.

35:05.929 --> 35:08.193
Yes, I am sure you
will catch up with me.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.586
But I'll likely be dead.

35:10.630 --> 35:14.286
I'm guessing I have weeks,
not months, left to live.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.202
I want to wish you luck
on your next idea, Dylan.

35:17.245 --> 35:20.118
I have a feeling you have
a lot more books to write.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.424
I was lucky to know you,

35:22.468 --> 35:24.774
and the world is lucky
to have you.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.660
JULIAN: I know you're angry,
but calm down.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.140
DYLAN:
Calm down?

35:42.183 --> 35:44.533
You had no right to go
and see Lizzie like that.

35:44.577 --> 35:45.882
No right to ambush
her like that.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.536
To test her like that.You're right.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.886
Any information about
Charlie should...

35:49.930 --> 35:51.714
Wait. What did you...?
Did you just...?

35:51.758 --> 35:53.455
Admit that I was wrong?

35:53.499 --> 35:54.848
Yes.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.502
Disconcerting, isn't it?

35:56.545 --> 35:57.851
Yes.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.722
You never apologize.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.855
I never make a mistake.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.684
But I did. I assumed
if Charlie Pavlik was dirty,

36:04.727 --> 36:06.207
Lizzie was, too.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.948
Right.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.211
How dirty was he?

36:10.255 --> 36:12.170
Judge for yourself.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.929
DYLAN:
They're not the same.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.801
Call your contact
in the Caymans.

36:34.844 --> 36:37.020
What?
Charlie did not
have an account.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.414
You're looking at notarized
signature cards, wire transfers.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.373
That is not his handwriting
or his signature.

36:41.416 --> 36:42.722
I'll find out who
opened that account.

36:42.765 --> 36:44.027
You'll find Rodrigo.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.297
Hey, guys.FUCCI: Hey, Doc.
How are you?

36:57.302 --> 36:59.347
I found Celia.
She's running up a tab

36:59.391 --> 37:00.914
at a resort in Bermuda.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.176
Lizzie...I don't care if

37:02.220 --> 37:03.743
she's dying or not.
The woman is a criminal.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.223
She shouldn't get away.
I need people

37:05.266 --> 37:06.920
who break the law
to pay the price.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.617
Charlie was not a dirty cop.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.838
What?

37:12.926 --> 37:14.971
But someone on your team was.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.761
Someone who was in on it.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.851
Someone who was by himself.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.200
LIZZIE:
Sosa?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.897
Something's wrong. I'm going in.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.769
No. It's too dangerous.

37:29.812 --> 37:32.511
You'll blow his cover,
get you both killed.

37:32.554 --> 37:33.947
Don't go.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.992
Stay where you are.
Stand down.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.690
Backup's on the way.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.387
CHARLIE:
Sosa.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.570
LIZZIE:
Shots fired. Shots fired.

37:59.755 --> 38:04.760
Charlie wasn't saying,
"I'm sorry."

38:04.804 --> 38:08.329
It's So... So... So...

38:08.373 --> 38:10.157
:
No, I'm sorry.

38:11.550 --> 38:12.725
Char-Charlie.

38:12.768 --> 38:15.205
Charlie? Charlie!

38:15.249 --> 38:18.296
He was trying to say,
"It's Sosa."

38:24.780 --> 38:25.999
The Cayman account was Sosa's.

38:26.042 --> 38:28.306
He set it up so that
he could take the money

38:28.349 --> 38:29.742
and Charlie would take the fall.

38:31.352 --> 38:32.701
Internal Affairs

38:32.745 --> 38:34.703
and the DEA are on their way.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.492
Son of a bitch!

38:40.535 --> 38:41.841
What the hell, Needham

38:41.884 --> 38:42.885
Back off!

38:44.365 --> 38:46.019
You want to tell them, Sosa?

38:46.062 --> 38:47.934
You want to tell them?

38:47.977 --> 38:49.457
Tell them how you worked
for the cartel?

38:49.501 --> 38:50.893
How you killed Charlie?

38:50.937 --> 38:53.461
Looked right at him
and shot him twice.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.333
Look at me. You look at me.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.944
Rafael Sosa,
you are under arrest

38:57.987 --> 38:59.728
for murder,
money laundering

38:59.772 --> 39:00.729
and conspiracy.

39:00.773 --> 39:01.991
You have the right

39:02.035 --> 39:04.864
to spend the rest
of your life in prison.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.911
Thank you.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.918
It's a privilege
to be in this place

39:58.961 --> 40:02.443
that honors so many
who have sacrificed so much.

40:04.619 --> 40:07.056
Charlie would have loved
this award.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.885
And you would have
loved Charlie.

40:09.929 --> 40:13.323
He would have given
an amazing speech.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.196
He was a good man,

40:16.239 --> 40:20.330
a great officer
and a true partner.

40:20.374 --> 40:23.072
He would have been moved,

40:23.116 --> 40:26.249
humbled and grateful.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.078
And he would have insisted

40:29.122 --> 40:31.472
on sharing this award
with his team.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.909
He was always talking
about you guys.

40:33.953 --> 40:37.086
Oh, man, how he respected you.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.743
How he loved you.

40:46.182 --> 40:48.924
So, on behalf
of Charles Pavlik,

40:48.968 --> 40:52.101
I am honored and proud...

40:54.930 --> 40:58.107
...so very proud
to accept this award.

40:58.151 --> 40:59.935
Thank you.

Hey, Andy.

Hey, Lizzie.

41:32.359 --> 41:34.100
Be right back.

41:34.143 --> 41:35.493
I wanted to say thank you.

41:36.450 --> 41:39.540
It's hard for me
to ask for help.

41:39.584 --> 41:43.022
I don't know if it's because
I feel I never need it

41:43.065 --> 41:45.764
or I don't deserve it, but...

41:45.807 --> 41:48.157
I have always done things
on my own.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.551
Until I met Charlie.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.422
He made me realize--

41:52.466 --> 41:55.034
and believe me, it wasn't easy
for either of us--

41:55.077 --> 41:58.211
that asking for help
isn't a sign of weakness;

41:58.254 --> 42:00.343
it's a sign of strength.

42:02.694 --> 42:05.523
Well, I didn't ask,
but I needed help this week

42:05.566 --> 42:07.873
in a big way,
and you gave it to me.

42:07.916 --> 42:09.875
Thank you.

42:09.918 --> 42:12.312
Thank you for...

42:12.355 --> 42:16.708
being my super special,
not so secret friend.

42:19.754 --> 42:22.540
You know,
sorrow in life

42:22.583 --> 42:24.716
just creates more
space for joy.

42:24.759 --> 42:27.501
And you, Lizzie Needham,
have just created

42:27.545 --> 42:29.329
a lot of space for
joy in your life.

42:29.372 --> 42:31.157
And I can't wait to
see you embrace it

42:31.200 --> 42:34.073
and to move on to the next
chapter of your life.
