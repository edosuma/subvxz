Let's go, Trojans!

00:07.039 --> 00:09.750
Close this game out, man.
Step on their throats!

00:11.320 --> 00:13.351
Uh... wow, Dad.

00:13.376 --> 00:14.554
You seem more excited
about this than I am,

00:14.579 --> 00:17.043
and I'm the one who went to USC.

00:17.068 --> 00:19.542
I'm the one who paid for it.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.045
Daddy, I had a full scholarship.

00:23.307 --> 00:26.745
Oh, yeah? Well, who paid for
your a cappella group uniform?

00:27.384 --> 00:28.570
Hey, check this out.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.642
Western Michigan pulled off
the upset in the other game.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.851
If we win, we'll play Dave's
team in the Sweet Sixteen.

00:32.876 --> 00:34.921
Oh-ho. Oh, Lord.

00:34.963 --> 00:36.710
I know you tell us to love thy neighbor,

00:36.735 --> 00:40.502
but just let us win this game
so I can crush Dave instead.

00:41.621 --> 00:45.273
Calvin, for the last time, stop
asking for God to crush people.

00:45.648 --> 00:47.810

01:16.546 --> 01:19.269
Okay, Marty, go ahead. Hit
him with the USC fight song.

01:19.294 --> 01:22.428
[EXHALES] Okay... I don't know it.

01:23.337 --> 01:26.085
Then what did you sing in
that corny a cappella group?

01:26.110 --> 01:27.100
Oh, it was mostly ballads.

01:27.125 --> 01:28.538
A few up-tempo chart-toppers.

01:28.563 --> 01:30.002
You want me to hit him with some Adele?

01:30.624 --> 01:32.452
How about something from Pitch Perfect?

01:32.477 --> 01:34.069
Five, six, seven, eight...

01:34.094 --> 01:36.122
Hey, guys. Sorry.

Couldn't see you behind my giant flag.

01:39.002 --> 01:40.525
Congrats on the big win, Dave.

01:40.550 --> 01:43.608
Yeah, and condolences in
advance on us crushing you.

01:43.633 --> 01:44.661
I don't know, Pop.

01:44.686 --> 01:46.573
Western Michigan has been
this year's Cinderella story.

01:46.598 --> 01:49.889
Ooh, that's right. And just
you watch, Calvin. My foot...

01:50.684 --> 01:53.465
is gonna fit perfectly
in that glass slipper.

01:55.193 --> 01:56.918
Whoo!

01:57.288 --> 01:58.917
You know, I love when Dave comes around.

still hugging at baggage claim.

calling him "the man,"

just remember that his
best friend is not even

05:12.844 --> 05:14.639
his main Logan.

05:14.877 --> 05:16.792
It's his side Logan.

Man, you guys look just
like I pictured you.

05:45.702 --> 05:47.553
Probably 'cause Dave sends
me a lot of pictures of you.

05:47.578 --> 05:51.040

of you was a little, uh...

05:51.065 --> 05:52.585
- blurry.
- Huh.

worked for the Geek Squad.

06:11.736 --> 06:14.377
Yeah, if you like
sitting with the enemy.

06:15.037 --> 06:16.442

You already have one.

with that instead of doing this.

Come on, Grover.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.231
These are a great way to
visualize your goals.

07:58.256 --> 08:00.234

because I'd like to travel.

yoga, because I'd like

to feel more inner peace.

What's the eagle for?

- Ooh, musical notes?

08:14.672 --> 08:17.606

day, I used to sing a little.

No. No, in a girl group.

out when they heard our name...

said it when he found out.

Can I find any of your songs online?

08:38.986 --> 08:40.513
No. We just did a demo.

08:40.538 --> 08:43.457
- After that, we broke up.
- Oh, how come?

that I was the most talented.

I'd be embarrassed.

Okay, fine. I'll go get it!

I can't get over these seats, man.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.451
What kind of connections do you have?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.958
- Well, he didn't tell you?
- Oh, let me guess.

09:21.983 --> 09:23.854
You were a cheerleader?

09:23.879 --> 09:25.502
Ah, so he did tell you.

09:26.398 --> 09:29.009
Wait. Seriously?

09:29.380 --> 09:32.497
Before you start, just know
male cheerleaders happen

09:32.522 --> 09:35.585
to be the backbone of the
collegiate spirit community.

09:35.610 --> 09:37.133
[LAUGHING]: Okay.

09:37.158 --> 09:38.989
I don't even care if we lose this game.

All right, laugh all you want, Calvin,

09:43.964 --> 09:45.989
but Dave was a hell of an athlete.
