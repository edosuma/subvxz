"You're so beautiful!"

We can add your cousin Bradley.

CORMACK: Vanuatu nationals,
Niman and Kalip Iesul,

01:10.281 --> 01:12.540
they linked to the driver
of the blue car, Ezekiel,

01:12.640 --> 01:13.780
who - listen to this -

01:13.880 --> 01:16.699
Isabel had a personal relationship with.

01:16.799 --> 01:18.979
ZHANG: So how do these cousins fit in?

01:19.079 --> 01:21.539
They went missing in Ashford
just before Isabel was killed.

01:21.639 --> 01:23.378
And if they're unlawful non-citizens,

01:23.478 --> 01:27.377
then they may have disappeared
on purpose, like Ezekiel did.

01:27.477 --> 01:29.817
This is not
a missing persons case, James.

01:29.917 --> 01:31.817
- Stay focused.
- It's not like that, OK?

01:31.917 --> 01:33.656
It's not like that. I am focused.

01:33.756 --> 01:36.496
I'm telling you,
these boys are connected.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.255
OK, can you at least
stop pissing off Troy Turner?

01:39.355 --> 01:40.815
I doubt it.

01:40.915 --> 01:42.535
He's immune to my natural charms.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.654
- Yeah, I know the feeling.
- Yes. OK. Thank you.

01:44.754 --> 01:46.254
- I got to go. Hey.
- Hey.

01:46.354 --> 01:47.494
I wanted to talk to your dad.

01:47.594 --> 01:48.854
This isn't a good time, Detective.

Look, this won't take long.

01:57.672 --> 02:00.791
Do you remember a fellow
by the name of Ezekiel Iesul?

02:01.911 --> 02:06.650
He was a seasonal worker here
at the same time as... Isabel's death.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.010
He came to church a few times.

02:09.110 --> 02:11.089
OK.

02:11.189 --> 02:12.209
Did you know him well?

02:12.309 --> 02:13.449
- No.
- Come on.

02:13.549 --> 02:16.249
You've been sending him Christmas cards
for the last two decades.

02:16.349 --> 02:18.348
Be honest with me.

02:19.708 --> 02:23.087
Zeke was a good man.

02:23.187 --> 02:25.187
Leave him be.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.186
Please.

02:37.705 --> 02:40.964
Zeke's wife said he hurt someone,
here in Ashford.

02:41.064 --> 02:41.964
Do you know who?

02:42.064 --> 02:45.603
The stuff that Zeke and I spoke about
is between me and God.

02:45.703 --> 02:48.443
Dad. Ezekiel is a suspect.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.662
- If you know something...
- Zeke didn't kill Isabel.

02:52.222 --> 02:54.082
Are you protecting him?

02:54.182 --> 02:57.761
I'm protecting my oath to God.

02:57.861 --> 03:00.040
I've said all I'm saying.

03:00.140 --> 03:03.440
Dropping bombs about Izzy's love life
ain't going to help him open up.

Glad you're here.

03:51.371 --> 03:53.831
It's good you're taking a look
at it again. How can we help?

03:53.931 --> 03:57.870
Perhaps you remember a fellow
by the name of Ezekiel Iesul?

03:57.970 --> 03:59.390
We had loads of workers back then.

03:59.490 --> 04:02.989
Of course, but this guy,
he was looking for his cousins.

04:03.089 --> 04:08.148
They were young Vanuatu boys
that went missing at the camp.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.847
Apparently he kicked up quite the fuss.

04:11.847 --> 04:13.847
Sorry. Can't help you.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.186
Ezekiel was an illegal immigrant.

04:17.286 --> 04:21.186
Was it normal practice
for you to hire illegal labour, or...?

04:21.286 --> 04:23.305
Yeah, probably.

04:23.405 --> 04:24.945
I mean, not intentionally, but...

04:25.045 --> 04:27.104
we didn't ask as many questions
back then.

04:27.204 --> 04:30.104
If you wanted to work, you got a job.
We needed the workers.

04:30.204 --> 04:31.904
The farmers needed the workers.

04:32.004 --> 04:33.383
Islanders wanted to work.

04:33.483 --> 04:35.423
They got to send good money
back home.

04:35.523 --> 04:39.702
We set up a camp down at the mill
to attract people to the region.

04:39.802 --> 04:41.102
And it worked.

04:41.202 --> 04:43.322
Except for those missing boys, huh?

04:44.481 --> 04:46.221
What's this got to do with Isabel?

04:46.321 --> 04:49.900
How did the workers
get from the camp to the farms?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.300
Billy drove the transport trucks,
didn't he?

04:52.400 --> 04:54.839
- Billy?
- Hopkins.

04:56.079 --> 04:57.619
Tasha's brother.

04:57.719 --> 04:59.659
Ah.

04:59.759 --> 05:02.018
- Does he still work for you?
- God, no. (LAUGHS)

05:02.118 --> 05:04.378
- He's a criminal.
- STEVE: Billy's alright.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.857
He's a good kid. Just had
a tough upbringing, that's all.

05:06.957 --> 05:09.577
Billy was charming and hard-working.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.956
Very loyal to Dad.

05:12.956 --> 05:15.376
But he's trouble.
He's always got a grift going on.

05:15.476 --> 05:17.735
Did he have a grift
with the foreign workers, maybe?

05:17.835 --> 05:20.515
- I doubt it.
- Wouldn't surprise me.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.974
The night Isabel died,

05:23.074 --> 05:26.334
you said that you were at
the T-intersection at 12:30 with her,

05:26.434 --> 05:28.093
and that was the last time
you saw her.

05:28.193 --> 05:32.033
Yet there's a witness that now says
she was somewhere else at that time.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.032
Why did you lie?

05:35.712 --> 05:37.712
Chloe, you don't need to answer that.

05:43.311 --> 05:45.310
I was ashamed.

05:47.790 --> 05:49.569
We were supposed to
walk home together,

05:49.669 --> 05:52.089
but I left her there.

05:52.189 --> 05:54.189
Alone.

06:00.267 --> 06:02.527
We started walking home...

06:02.627 --> 06:05.566
and... we stopped in the park.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.626
We had a drink in our van, and...

06:10.346 --> 06:11.725
Iz had just broken up with Anton.

06:11.825 --> 06:14.985
I was trying to cheer up
by talking about our trip.

06:16.664 --> 06:18.804
And then Iz said she wasn't coming.

06:18.904 --> 06:20.904
Just...

06:22.063 --> 06:24.683
Just like that, out of the blue, and...

06:24.783 --> 06:26.783
we had a stupid fight.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.222
And I kicked her out of the van.

06:31.022 --> 06:32.441
And drove home.

06:32.541 --> 06:35.021
- What time?
- 11:30.

06:36.581 --> 06:39.860
I lied back then
because I drove drunk and...

06:41.420 --> 06:43.240
..I kept lying
so that people wouldn't know

06:43.340 --> 06:45.339
that I left her there alone.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.618
What sort of friend does that?

07:02.856 --> 07:05.335
Dad, we need to talk.

07:07.455 --> 07:09.455
I've got nothing to say.

07:10.814 --> 07:14.134
Why are you withholding
information that could help?

07:15.134 --> 07:17.633
I told you,
I have a covenant with God.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.153
And Cormack has a covenant

07:19.253 --> 07:21.532
with Isabel
and two missing Islander boys.

07:28.691 --> 07:30.351
Zeke came to me,

07:30.451 --> 07:33.310
and said his cousins were missing.

07:33.410 --> 07:35.410
I looked around, but nothing.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.809
The day Isabel got killed...

07:39.849 --> 07:42.669
he'd confronted Steve Walcott
about the boys.

07:42.769 --> 07:44.348
There was an altercation.

07:44.448 --> 07:47.988
Zeke struck Steve
and Billy stepped in.

07:48.088 --> 07:50.447
He beat Zeke very badly.

07:51.727 --> 07:54.406
He was with me
when Isabel got killed.

08:04.725 --> 08:07.804
When the police said that they were
looking for a blue station wagon...

08:09.444 --> 08:11.663
..I told Zeke to leave.

08:11.763 --> 08:13.803
I knew he was innocent.

08:16.522 --> 08:20.082
But I also knew that
that meant nothing to Turner.

08:26.161 --> 08:28.160
And the missing Islander boys?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I don't know.

08:32.359 --> 08:34.359
After Isabel...

08:40.518 --> 08:42.518
..they just got lost.

08:46.397 --> 08:48.756
Kicking is coming along,
but we need to keep practicing.

08:50.636 --> 08:52.456
We can do some solo sessions
if you're up for it.

08:52.556 --> 08:53.736
Just you and me.

08:53.836 --> 08:55.095
Yeah. Sounds good.

08:55.195 --> 08:56.255
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:56.355 --> 08:57.815
OK.

08:57.915 --> 08:59.574
Need a lift home?

08:59.674 --> 09:01.454
No, I'm good. I'm meeting Mum.

09:01.554 --> 09:04.174
We're going to get the final supplies
for my graduation party.

09:04.274 --> 09:05.733
Oh, yeah. Congrats on that.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.373
Athlete and a scholar!

09:07.473 --> 09:09.613
- Runs in the family.
- Thanks, Coach.

09:09.713 --> 09:10.692
I'll see you next week.

09:10.792 --> 09:12.792
Yep. See ya.

09:28.309 --> 09:30.309
Mate, what the hell are you doing?

09:32.228 --> 09:34.228
Just helping out the team.

09:35.788 --> 09:37.787
Better be careful, boy.

09:41.267 --> 09:43.266
MAN: Hey, Victor!

09:52.465 --> 09:54.324
Do you remember getting a report

09:54.424 --> 09:57.524
for two missing foreign workers
back in '94?

09:57.624 --> 09:59.763
Not that I recall. Why?

09:59.863 --> 10:02.263
- I'm just kicking tyres.
- QUINN: Sarge.

10:03.783 --> 10:06.842
Got the address Billy Hopkins
registered with his P.O.

10:06.942 --> 10:09.642
Why are you wasting time
on a grub like Billy?

10:09.742 --> 10:12.721
Have you found the owner of
the blue car yet?

10:12.821 --> 10:15.301
Getting very close. Thank you.

10:38.416 --> 10:40.416
(LOUD KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:04.652 --> 11:05.671
You should have called ahead.

11:05.771 --> 11:07.431
I would have worn me good jocks for you.

11:07.531 --> 11:08.751
Eh...

11:08.851 --> 11:10.430
You can keep your pants on, mate.

11:10.530 --> 11:12.310
I'm not with Corrections.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.410
No.

11:14.930 --> 11:18.669
You're that plod that's looking into
the Isabel Baker case, aren't you?

11:18.769 --> 11:20.769
Yes, I am.

11:21.608 --> 11:23.608
(SIGHS)

11:24.368 --> 11:26.308
So, did you know her well?

11:26.408 --> 11:28.407
Nup. Not well.

11:29.727 --> 11:31.727
- That your bicycle?
- (LAUGHS)

11:32.366 --> 11:34.626
Yeah, it's blowing a bit of smoke.
I, um...

11:34.726 --> 11:36.386
I just recoated the head.

11:36.486 --> 11:38.225
Did me apprenticeship on the inside.

11:38.325 --> 11:40.545
Oh, that's smart.

11:40.645 --> 11:42.944
- Mechanics, hey?
- Yeah.

11:43.044 --> 11:45.104
- It's a pretty good caper.
- Yeah.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.584
Hey, your sister told me that

11:46.684 --> 11:49.263
you saw Isabel with an older fella.

11:49.363 --> 11:50.943
Yeah. Cute couple.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.583
Pity she was supposed to be
going out with Anton at the time.

11:53.683 --> 11:56.322
(LAUGHS)
Always the church, girls, eh?

11:57.802 --> 12:00.421
Do you know where
this older fellow was staying?

12:00.521 --> 12:01.621
Was he at the workers camp?

12:01.721 --> 12:02.901
Don't know. Probably.

12:03.001 --> 12:05.140
Used to cram them in there.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.900
Seen better conditions in the joint,
you know?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.700
How'd it work, exactly?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.259
Oh...

12:11.359 --> 12:14.139
Steve used to lure the Islanders here
under the promise of work.

12:14.239 --> 12:16.858
And then he'd charge
the farmers for the labour,

12:16.958 --> 12:18.938
and then he'd collect the rents
from the workers.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.777
(LAUGHS) Fuckin' Tokyo rents, too.
Pretty good racket.

12:21.877 --> 12:23.617
Sounds like it, eh?

12:23.717 --> 12:27.256
You remember a couple of
Islander boys went missing.

12:27.356 --> 12:29.536
Niman and Kalip Iesul.

12:29.636 --> 12:32.095
Um... Isabel and her bloke,

12:32.195 --> 12:35.135
I think they were looking for
some missing boys back then.

12:35.235 --> 12:36.975
His cousins, I think.

12:37.075 --> 12:38.934
- Do you know where they were?
- What?

12:39.034 --> 12:40.534
Ooh! Do you know where they were?

12:40.634 --> 12:42.734
You used to drive them around,
didn't you? The workers.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.013
That was your job, right?

12:44.113 --> 12:46.533
Righto, Tintin,
I didn't do shit back then.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.853
I don't have to say shit
to you right now,

12:47.953 --> 12:49.212
and I'm free to fucking go
any time I like.

12:49.312 --> 12:51.012
Yeah, of course you are.
Where you going to go, though?

12:51.112 --> 12:52.252
You live here, don't you?

12:52.352 --> 12:54.411
Yeah, well, I'll just...

12:54.511 --> 12:55.611
I'll fucking go inside, then.

12:55.711 --> 12:57.611
Go back inside, then.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.710
Cockhead.

13:00.790 --> 13:02.790
Feel free to fuck off.

13:05.069 --> 13:06.129
What's this?

13:06.229 --> 13:08.409
Ashford's top ten videos of 1994.

13:08.509 --> 13:10.528
It's an idea for our time capsule.

13:10.628 --> 13:12.208
Fugitive - number two.

13:12.308 --> 13:14.828
Ready? (DEEPER, EMOTIONAL VOICE)
I didn't kill my wife!

13:15.947 --> 13:18.087
No? Harrison Ford?

13:18.187 --> 13:19.607
I don't know what that was.

13:19.707 --> 13:21.646
So... Um...

13:21.746 --> 13:23.926
My parents are going to be
in Brisbane this weekend.

13:24.026 --> 13:25.366
You should totally come to my place.

13:25.466 --> 13:27.285
We'll have the whole place
to ourselves.

13:27.385 --> 13:29.725
Awesome! A party is exactly
what I need right now.

13:29.825 --> 13:32.024
No, I wasn't thinking a party.
Just us.

13:34.904 --> 13:38.003
No, gammin. Party will be sick.

13:38.103 --> 13:39.883
No, that's fine.

13:39.983 --> 13:42.563
Just take it.
Seriously?

13:42.663 --> 13:44.702
I love you sometimes, Hector.

14:02.139 --> 14:03.919
Isabel...

14:04.019 --> 14:06.018
I'm so sorry.

14:06.698 --> 14:08.698
Can I explain?

14:09.258 --> 14:12.477
I think that boy he saw running
was my cousin from Tanna, Kalip.

14:12.577 --> 14:15.317
Him and his brother Niman
were working a job out of town.

14:15.417 --> 14:18.496
They were staying on-site
and they were due back days ago.

14:19.736 --> 14:21.735
They still haven't shown up.

14:22.415 --> 14:25.295
So when you said you saw
that boy running, I just lost it.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.934
I wasn't angry at you.

14:29.894 --> 14:31.913
I'm just scared for my cousins.

14:32.013 --> 14:34.013
They're so far from home and...

14:35.373 --> 14:37.492
..they don't speak much English.

14:39.292 --> 14:41.792
We could go back to Dalkeith.
I can show you around.

14:41.892 --> 14:43.891
I know the area.

14:46.091 --> 14:47.551
Are you sure?

14:47.651 --> 14:49.230
What are Niman and Kalip like?

14:49.330 --> 14:51.330
They're good Island boys.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.849
They work hard.

14:55.449 --> 14:57.449
Respect others.

14:58.769 --> 15:00.768
Respect God.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.727
And they're fun.

15:06.127 --> 15:08.127
Always laughing and fooling around.

15:09.807 --> 15:11.806
Niman's strong.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.166
Proud.

15:16.445 --> 15:18.445
IZZY: What about Kalip?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.964
Jesus, please help me!

15:25.604 --> 15:27.603
ZEKE: He's a gentle soul.

15:29.323 --> 15:31.323
That's why I'm worried.

15:33.562 --> 15:35.562
They're our chief's sons.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.001
It's my duty to protect them
while they're here.

15:40.761 --> 15:42.760
And I failed.

15:56.838 --> 15:58.997
No trail bike's getting through that.

16:01.797 --> 16:03.817
- What's out here?
- Not much.

16:03.917 --> 16:06.556
Just cane fields and orchards
all the way back to town.

16:08.396 --> 16:10.395
Let's try the other way.

16:11.115 --> 16:13.135
Come on.

16:13.235 --> 16:15.235
We'll find them.

16:21.153 --> 16:22.613
Do you think
they could be working here?

16:22.713 --> 16:24.713
Yeah, maybe.

16:53.148 --> 16:55.147
Isabel...

17:22.942 --> 17:24.942
(EXHALES)

17:31.061 --> 17:33.060
I don't like this place.

17:35.740 --> 17:37.739
Let's go.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.077
- ZEKE: I'm sorry...
- BILLY: Who the fuck are you?

17:52.177 --> 17:53.636
And what are you doing in my shed?

17:53.736 --> 17:56.396
- ZEKE: I'm just looking for my cousin.
- BILLY: Who the fuck are you?

17:56.496 --> 17:58.516
IZZY: Billy! Take it easy.

17:58.616 --> 18:00.615
Isabel.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.595
What the hell are you guys doing here?

18:03.695 --> 18:05.514
We're just looking for Zeke's cousins.

18:05.614 --> 18:07.954
They're lost around here somewhere.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.274
Well, I haven't seen them.

18:09.374 --> 18:11.313
- Are you sure? Because...
- I said I haven't seen them.

18:11.413 --> 18:13.413
OK. No worries.

18:13.973 --> 18:15.972
Sorry, Billy.

18:24.091 --> 18:26.890
(FOOTSTEPS)

18:33.209 --> 18:34.709
Sorry I'm late.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.068
Street lights came on 5 minutes ago.

18:37.168 --> 18:38.428
Yeah. Sorry, Dad.

18:38.528 --> 18:41.308
I was out filming the fruit bats
for the time capsule.

18:41.408 --> 18:45.067
JOE: We have rules, Isabel.
I don't want you out at night.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.467
Can't believe you
almost got a clip over the years

18:47.567 --> 18:49.786
'cause you're out chasing fruit bats.

18:49.886 --> 18:51.066
Where you filming them?

18:51.166 --> 18:53.685
Dalkeith. On Harper's Road.

18:56.765 --> 18:58.425
GLENDA: Better you
stay away from there.

18:58.525 --> 19:01.144
Yeah. That place
is full of bad business.

19:01.244 --> 19:03.244
What happened?

19:04.004 --> 19:06.003
It's my history too.

19:13.242 --> 19:16.621
Years back,
Dalkeith was a fancy homestead.

19:16.721 --> 19:20.361
And there were two sisters out there
doing domestic work.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.140
They weren't much older than you
when tuberculosis got them.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.859
And the boss man buried them
in the fields out there.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.959
No markers.

19:31.718 --> 19:34.318
Homestead burnt down
not long after.

19:35.678 --> 19:38.577
And the place was rebuilt
after the war.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.237
But then the new owner killed himself
after his wife run off.

19:43.636 --> 19:46.196
It's been, um, empty ever since.

19:47.716 --> 19:49.715
That place is cursed.

19:50.635 --> 19:52.735
Don't go back there, Isabel.

19:52.835 --> 19:54.834
The enemy lives there.

20:08.192 --> 20:10.811
Did you ever interview Billy Hopkins?

20:10.911 --> 20:12.851
Eh?

20:12.951 --> 20:16.410
Did you ever interview Billy Hopkins?

20:16.510 --> 20:18.130
He had an alibi.

20:18.230 --> 20:19.850
Yeah. Who?

20:19.950 --> 20:21.089
Work.

20:21.189 --> 20:23.329
Steve Walcott.

20:23.429 --> 20:25.768
Just the two of them, huh?
Together.

20:25.868 --> 20:26.888
- Alone?
- Yeah.

20:26.988 --> 20:29.608
Look, I know Billy can be
a slippery prick,

20:29.708 --> 20:33.567
but if Steve says he was with him,
you can take that to the bank.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.567
I've known him for 40 years.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.526
Well, you've also known Chloe
for 40 years.

20:38.626 --> 20:41.886
And she lied, and you didn't know it.

20:41.986 --> 20:44.965
Did you know that Steve
was hiring illegal workers

20:45.065 --> 20:47.165
and renting them out
to the farmers?

20:47.265 --> 20:49.924
(LAUGHS) What are you,
the fucking ombudsman?

20:50.024 --> 20:53.323
A town like this
needs industry to survive.

20:53.423 --> 20:56.003
The workers needed the work.

20:56.103 --> 20:58.682
It was a symbiotic relationship.

20:58.782 --> 21:02.942
Well, you can, uh, dress it up in
whatever word of the day you want.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.841
But at the end of the day,
it's ex-ploi-ta-tion.

21:07.941 --> 21:09.940
Exploitation.

21:13.020 --> 21:14.320
TASHA: What are you doing?

21:14.420 --> 21:15.959
I need a pair of stools for this thing.

21:16.059 --> 21:18.059
Righto.

21:18.659 --> 21:21.478
You know, you don't have to
watch your old sex tapes.

21:21.578 --> 21:23.758
Fair bit of filth online these days.

21:23.858 --> 21:26.237
Yeah, it's my...
my own private collection, though.

21:26.337 --> 21:28.337
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:30.097 --> 21:31.996
Seriously, mate, what are you doing?

21:32.096 --> 21:33.596
I'm trying to jog my memory. I...

21:33.696 --> 21:35.996
I know there's footage on here
of Isabel,

21:36.096 --> 21:38.955
and she's blowing her top at Steve
on the night she was killed.

21:39.055 --> 21:41.115
Oh, for fuck's sake, Billy!

21:41.215 --> 21:42.354
What? Careful.

21:42.454 --> 21:44.474
Move your shit.

21:44.574 --> 21:46.834
Can't you just leave that shit
in the past? Fuck!

21:46.934 --> 21:47.953
Steve owes me.

21:48.053 --> 21:49.473
And when he pays up...

21:49.573 --> 21:51.573
then I'll leave it in the past.

21:54.132 --> 21:56.032
And then I'll spoil you stupid
with the proceeds.

21:56.132 --> 21:57.832
- (LAUGHS) Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

21:57.932 --> 22:00.031
We'll blow a shitload on a cruise,

22:00.131 --> 22:03.191
sinks some mojitos in the sun...

22:03.291 --> 22:04.630
(LAUGHS)

22:04.730 --> 22:05.990
- Come here.
- Fuck!

22:06.090 --> 22:07.550
- Dance on the deck...
- Fuck!

22:07.650 --> 22:09.389
..in the moonlight. (LAUGHS)

22:09.489 --> 22:11.629
You're on fucking parole, you clown.

22:11.729 --> 22:14.629
- Fucking can't leave the country.
- (SINGS TUNE)

22:14.729 --> 22:16.868
(LAUGHS)

22:16.968 --> 22:19.188
(PHONE RINGS)

22:19.288 --> 22:20.787
Hey, boss lady.

22:20.887 --> 22:24.707
ZHANG: So, turns out those boys
you're looking for are illegals too.

22:24.807 --> 22:26.466
They entered into Brisbane
a few weeks ago,

22:26.566 --> 22:28.666
BEFORE Isabel's death -

22:28.766 --> 22:30.146
never left.

22:30.246 --> 22:32.545
- I just sent the files to you.
- OK.

22:32.645 --> 22:34.465
Uh, thank you. I'll check them out
and get back to you.

22:34.565 --> 22:36.565
Uh, bye.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.041
Fuck off. What?

22:59.120 --> 23:01.220
Chip?

23:01.320 --> 23:03.739
(TAPE WHIRS)

23:03.839 --> 23:05.699
- ..cleaner. She's not much older
than Chloe.
- Isabel..

23:05.799 --> 23:07.139
We know you lied about Niman and Kalip.

23:07.239 --> 23:08.219
- What? I...
- Those boys...

23:08.319 --> 23:09.858
I don't know what
you're talking about, alright?

23:09.958 --> 23:11.958
They could be in trouble.
You don't even care!

23:13.238 --> 23:15.237
There we go.

23:18.077 --> 23:21.256
Yeah, well, I prefer the other one.
But anyway...

23:21.356 --> 23:23.136
Don't forget, top shelf.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.416
(WHISTLES)

23:24.516 --> 23:25.615
Namaste, blondie.

23:25.715 --> 23:27.615
- Don't call me.
- (LAUGHS)

23:27.715 --> 23:29.695
You used to like it.

23:29.795 --> 23:32.134
Ever think about us together?

23:32.234 --> 23:33.734
When I want to skip a meal.

23:33.834 --> 23:34.934
(LAUGHS)

23:35.034 --> 23:37.373
I used to think about it
all the time in the joint.

23:37.473 --> 23:40.293
You used to get me all warm,
you know?

23:40.393 --> 23:42.392
(LAUGHS)

23:43.112 --> 23:45.172
What do you want, Billy?

23:45.272 --> 23:48.031
I thought I'd give you
the world premiere of my new flick,

23:49.191 --> 23:50.491
IZZY: ..feeds on black bodies.

23:50.591 --> 23:52.731
I heard you with the cleaner.
She's not much older than Chloe.

23:52.831 --> 23:55.090
- What are you talking about?
- And now you lied
about Niman and Kalip.

23:55.190 --> 23:56.450
- What? I...
- Those boys...

23:56.550 --> 24:00.009
See, that city cop was asking me
about those missing Islander boys.

24:00.109 --> 24:01.729
And here's Isabel, and...

24:01.829 --> 24:04.648
she's accusing your dad of
some kind of mischief with missing boys

24:04.748 --> 24:06.968
same day she was killed. (LAUGHS)

24:07.068 --> 24:09.967
I should probably
show that to the cop.

24:10.067 --> 24:12.067
What do you reckon?

24:12.747 --> 24:14.746
(STOPS TAPE)

24:16.426 --> 24:18.166
Do what you want.

24:18.266 --> 24:20.265
It's not me on the tape.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.205
Yeah, it's not great PR
for the mill, though, is it?

24:24.305 --> 24:26.764
We'll survive. We always have.

24:26.864 --> 24:27.884
(LAUGHS)

24:27.984 --> 24:30.084
Dad'll have to go, obviously.

24:30.184 --> 24:31.603
- WOMAN: Hey, Chloe.
- Hey.

24:31.703 --> 24:36.143
But that's alright. We'll, um, announce
an inquiry, install a new CEO...

24:37.182 --> 24:39.082
..call it generational change.

24:39.182 --> 24:40.602
(LAUGHS)

24:40.702 --> 24:42.961
So you'd really sell your old man out?

24:43.061 --> 24:44.681
You're the one selling him out.

24:44.781 --> 24:46.441
I'm just offering him early retirement.

24:46.541 --> 24:51.280
And I know that you are squatting
at the house on Harper's Road.

24:51.380 --> 24:54.079
Mill still owns that property,
so you set one more foot on it,

24:54.179 --> 24:56.499
and I'll have you arrested
for trespassing.

24:57.619 --> 24:59.618
Namaste.

25:00.378 --> 25:01.718
(GRUNTS)

25:01.818 --> 25:03.118
What's the occasion?

25:03.218 --> 25:05.417
The olds' 40th anniversary.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.637
Fair effort.

25:08.737 --> 25:09.996
Yep.

25:10.096 --> 25:11.996
So, how's the concussion?

25:12.096 --> 25:14.396
You remember who jumped you yet?

25:14.496 --> 25:16.035
No.

25:16.135 --> 25:19.035
- Still foggy.
- Surprise, surprise.

25:19.135 --> 25:21.134
It's just small town shit.

25:21.934 --> 25:23.934
Old grudges.

25:24.374 --> 25:26.373
So it's got nothing
to do with Isabel, then?

25:28.133 --> 25:31.552
You know, if somebody threatened
you, I can't get you protected.

25:31.652 --> 25:32.632
(FOOTSTEPS)

25:32.732 --> 25:34.732
VIC: Constable Cormack!

25:36.371 --> 25:38.471
Anton did not tell me
he was bringing a date.

25:38.571 --> 25:39.831
Anton!

25:39.931 --> 25:41.930
(LAUGHS)

25:42.770 --> 25:45.350
I just come to see
how he's recovering.

25:45.450 --> 25:47.309
That's nice. But he'll be fine.

25:47.409 --> 25:49.389

- Mm-hm.

25:49.489 --> 25:51.029
Oh, congratulations.

25:51.129 --> 25:52.668

- Thanks.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.028
You married? Kids?

25:54.128 --> 25:56.628
- Ah... Best thing I ever done.
- Mm-hm.

25:56.728 --> 25:59.867
You know, a man needs a family if
he's going to do anything worthwhile.

25:59.967 --> 26:01.967
Finding a woman, having children...

26:03.007 --> 26:05.066
..that's the easy part.

You coming out?

26:54.237 --> 26:56.717
Billy just showed me a tape.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.756
Of you and Izzy,
from the day of the formal.

27:01.076 --> 27:03.575
- What happened to those boys?
- I have no idea.

27:03.675 --> 27:05.455
I don't know what Isabel
was talking about.

27:05.555 --> 27:06.735
She was going hysterical.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.835
Izzy was never hysterical.

27:09.554 --> 27:11.414
Where were you the night she died?

27:11.514 --> 27:13.514
You're kidding?

27:13.914 --> 27:16.073
I could ask you the same thing.

27:26.791 --> 27:28.451
- Thanks, Jan.
- Thanks.

27:28.551 --> 27:30.551
I'm at the pub. Where are you?

27:31.550 --> 27:34.530
Yeah, fixed that, uh,
fixed that camera.

what we got on Steve.

27:50.027 --> 27:51.607
No, I was feeling nostalgic.

27:51.707 --> 27:53.126
- We drank it at the formal.
- Uh-huh.

27:53.226 --> 27:56.526

28:33.019 --> 28:34.039
OK.

28:34.139 --> 28:36.838
I think Izzy was helping Zeke
look for those lost boys.

28:36.938 --> 28:39.158
Dad said that Zeke
got in a fight with Steve Wolcott.

28:39.258 --> 28:40.278
That's who he hurt.

28:40.378 --> 28:41.677
He didn't kill Izzy.

28:41.777 --> 28:43.977
He was with Dad that night,
at the church.

28:45.737 --> 28:48.696
Right, then, so,
your father has no alibi.

28:49.736 --> 28:50.676
What?

28:50.776 --> 28:53.595
Well, in his original statement,
he said he was at home.

28:53.695 --> 28:55.275
Now he's saying that
he was at the church,

28:55.375 --> 28:57.515
and the only person that
can confirm that is dead.

28:57.615 --> 28:59.074

I'm trying to
get answers for your sister,

29:08.333 --> 29:09.912

We're just having a chat.

No worries.

30:13.961 --> 30:16.300
Sorry. He's just a little drunk.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.060
I'll get him home.

was... tough.

But this rage today...

31:01.272 --> 31:03.271
..was ugly.

31:03.751 --> 31:06.611
- This isn't you.
- Well, maybe it is.

31:06.711 --> 31:09.230
I drank too much at the formal,
and I blacked out.

31:10.230 --> 31:12.010

What is it?

31:40.305 --> 31:42.324
It's Isabel's.

31:42.424 --> 31:44.424

Mum took us down to Timezone.

46:32.141 --> 46:33.521
We were playing Daytona.

46:33.621 --> 46:37.500
I won Ritchie this little stuffed animal
from the skill tester.

46:38.860 --> 46:41.959
And after the arcade,
we got some videos.

46:42.059 --> 46:43.799
We were going to have a movie night.

46:43.899 --> 46:45.119
So I cued up the film,

46:45.219 --> 46:47.238
I put some popcorn in the microwave,

46:47.338 --> 46:48.518
and then Dad got home.

46:48.618 --> 46:50.618
He was hammered
and he was looking for a fight.

46:52.137 --> 46:54.377
I should have just
let him beat me up, but...

46:57.336 --> 47:00.636
For some reason, that night,
I just decided to fight back.

47:00.736 --> 47:02.195
And that just made him madder.

47:02.295 --> 47:05.475
And after he finished
giving me a hiding,

47:05.575 --> 47:08.434
he threw me across the room,
and then he turned on Mum.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.214
Mum screamed at me
to get Ritchie out of the room.

47:12.654 --> 47:14.633
But Ritchie wasn't there.

I couldn't...
couldn't find him for a minute,

47:16.933 --> 47:19.712
and then I could hear him crying
in the closet in our bedroom.

47:19.812 --> 47:21.952
So I went in there,
and I opened the door,

47:22.052 --> 47:23.272
and he must have thought I was Dad,

47:23.372 --> 47:25.351
because he's...

47:25.451 --> 47:27.611
he cut me with his fishing knife.

47:29.890 --> 47:31.890
I fell to the floor.

47:32.250 --> 47:35.089
And as I lay there, I realised that
I couldn't hear Mum no more.

That's weird that...

47:38.929 --> 47:41.308

that meant that she was still alive.

is getting out of jail, so it's...
