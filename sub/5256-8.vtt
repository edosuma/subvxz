02:19.240 --> 02:22.808
Not only did Jules Verne
write a decent book,

02:22.810 --> 02:26.111

02:48.068 --> 02:49.835
I'm gonna go to
a competing paper.

Okay, well,

02:52.339 --> 02:55.707
if you put it that way,
you're leaving, like, tomorrow

02:55.709 --> 02:58.076

It says that Nellie Bly

We've only been around
for three years.

03:10.891 --> 03:14.393
So, like, what if we also sent
a journalist,

03:14.395 --> 03:15.994
and then she went
around the world?

03:15.996 --> 03:20.599
And it was definitely "she,"
because, like, fairness.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.302
He thinks
of Elizabeth Bisland.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.903
<i>She's their literary editor.</i>

03:24.905 --> 03:28.473

<i>and just kind of generally</i>
<i>being hot.</i>

03:31.111 --> 03:34.112
He says, Would you like to go

03:34.114 --> 03:35.314
You have to leave tonight?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.448

03:36.450 --> 03:41.486
Well, if my editor wants me
to do it, I'll go.

03:41.488 --> 03:46.325
And so, six hours after
even learning of this idea,

03:46.327 --> 03:49.228
Elizabeth Bisland
starts heading west.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.696
<i>Nellie Bly's already</i>

04:00.908 --> 04:04.343
So Nellie Bly lands
in England.

Somebody says to her,

04:05.279 --> 04:07.179
Jules Verne would like
to meet you.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.181
She's like,

04:09.183 --> 04:10.182

No, no, no,

05:37.438 --> 05:39.438
there's another woman

05:39.440 --> 05:40.405

05:40.407 --> 05:43.675
She was here, like,
a while ago, and you're losing.

<i>She's going across the Pacific.</i>

05:52.353 --> 05:54.553

<i>I'm trying to enjoy</i>
<i>my breakfast.</i>

09:20.561 --> 09:23.061
In 1898,
the Spanish-American War

09:23.063 --> 09:25.764
<i>broke out,</i>
<i>and two major publishers</i>

09:25.766 --> 09:29.234
<i>named Joseph Pulitzer</i>
<i>and William Randolph Hearst</i>

09:29.236 --> 09:31.536
- Name drop.
- I will, I'll do it.

09:31.538 --> 09:32.304
I'll name-drop them.

09:32.306 --> 09:33.805
<i>Hearst and Pulitzer</i>
<i>took advantage of this,</i>

09:33.807 --> 09:36.374
<i>and so they raised the price</i>
<i>of the newspapers</i>

09:36.376 --> 09:37.309
<i>to 60 cents a bundle.</i>

09:37.311 --> 09:39.010
<i>People were</i>
<i>just buying newspapers.</i>

09:39.012 --> 09:40.378
They were like,
I've got to find out

09:40.380 --> 09:41.079
what's going on.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.616
But then when the war was over,
they didn't lower the price

09:44.618 --> 09:46.851
<i>of the newspapers,</i>
<i>and people weren't buying</i>

09:46.853 --> 09:47.786
<i>as many newspapers.</i>

09:47.788 --> 09:49.788
<i>So the newsies</i>
<i>couldn't make their money back.</i>

09:49.790 --> 09:52.457
<i>And so there were</i>
<i>a handful of newsies,</i>

09:52.459 --> 09:56.461
<i>mainly led by Morris Cohen</i>
<i>and Kid Blink.</i>

09:56.463 --> 09:58.797
<i>Kid Blink has a patch</i>
<i>over one eye,</i>

09:58.799 --> 10:00.865
<i>and he looks like a man.</i>

10:00.867 --> 10:04.502
[both chuckle]

10:04.504 --> 10:06.171
- This is really--

10:06.173 --> 10:07.939
This doesn't get easier.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.242
You think you're gonna get
a taste for the flavor,

10:11.244 --> 10:13.945
and it just gets
more and more violent.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.513
- [laughs]
<i>- [blows raspberry]</i>

10:15.515 --> 10:19.250
Okay, anyway...
[laughs]

10:19.252 --> 10:22.787
<i>They went to Hearst</i>
<i>and to Pulitzer,</i>

10:22.789 --> 10:25.190
and they said,
Would you lower the prices

10:25.192 --> 10:26.791
back to 50 cents?

10:26.793 --> 10:29.094
And they said,
No, we're not gonna do that.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.662
We're not gonna
lower the price.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.831
Okay, so that's when--

10:32.833 --> 10:38.703
Yeah, so, when they were like--
they were just like,

10:38.705 --> 10:41.072
Strike!

10:41.074 --> 10:41.706
Strike!

10:41.708 --> 10:45.310
<i>You're not gonna sell that.</i>
<i>No, this is a revolution.</i>

10:45.312 --> 10:47.712
<i>Any of the other newsies</i>
<i>they saw with newspapers,</i>

10:47.714 --> 10:51.082
<i>they would take them, and</i>
<i>they would rip the papers up.</i>

10:51.084 --> 10:54.185
<i>[imitates paper tearing]</i>

11:00.893 --> 11:03.261
<i>William Randolph Hearst</i>
<i>and Joseph Pulitzer</i>

11:03.263 --> 11:06.231
sent men in
to go into the streets

11:06.233 --> 11:07.932
to, like, try to control
these newsies.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.467
<i>The newsies attacked</i>
<i>these men.</i>

11:09.469 --> 11:12.103
<i>They attacked the men.</i>
<i>They jumped on them.</i>

11:12.105 --> 11:15.373
They were like,
Uh-uh, no, no, no, no.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.410
But really what--what really
did something was

11:18.412 --> 11:19.978
<i>they all walked and stormed</i>

11:19.980 --> 11:22.414
<i>and held up traffic</i>
<i>on Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

11:22.416 --> 11:25.450
<i>Kid Blink is giving a speech.</i>
<i>He's saying...</i>

11:25.452 --> 11:28.086
Friends and coworkers,

11:28.088 --> 11:30.655
we got to stick together
like glue.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.123
We--
This is a time--

11:32.125 --> 11:33.692
this is something
we need to do.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.894
Even if you're blind.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.162
You have to do this.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.931
Police drove up,
and they were like...

11:39.933 --> 11:44.002
<i>[imitates engine whirring]</i>

11:44.004 --> 11:46.905
That's the exact noise
that the police car made.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.574
- [imitating engine whirring]

11:49.576 --> 11:50.542
<i>- Oh, wait.</i>
- There you go.

11:50.544 --> 11:54.279
<i>[both imitating engine</i>
<i>whirring]</i>

11:58.417 --> 12:01.086
So the cops were like,
You're going to jail.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.422
<i>[militaristic music]</i>

12:04.424 --> 12:08.059
And these kids were like,
What are we gonna do now?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.562
Like, we have nothing.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.031
And then...

12:13.033 --> 12:15.834
Kid Blink shows up.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.069
<i>Bl-ow.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

12:18.071 --> 12:23.208
<i>And he is dressed</i>
<i>to the nines,</i>

12:23.210 --> 12:25.243
<i>and he has a wad of cash.</i>

12:25.245 --> 12:27.545
And he's like,
Hey, it's not that bad,

12:27.547 --> 12:29.981
like, we should probably stop
doing what we're doing.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.550
We should--you know,
we should respect the rules.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.385
We should go back
to our lives.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.386
All is good.

12:35.388 --> 12:39.824
So the beret--
No, wait.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.794
Uh, Morris Cohen was like,
I get it.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.962
You've been bought out.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.730
They bought you out.

12:45.732 --> 12:46.731
Like, look at you.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.901
<i>And so they kicked Kid Blink</i>
<i>out of the club.</i>

12:49.903 --> 12:51.202
It was like,
You are not cool.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.506
You're a scab
and an asshole.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.242
<i>And then Morris Cohen</i>
<i>took over and said,</i>

12:57.244 --> 12:58.576
We're not gonna
go down like that.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.912
We're not gonna
get bought out.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.213
We're gonna do this.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.282
<i>And so</i>
<i>they were growing in numbers.</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:08.253
<i>More and more kids were joining</i>
<i>the newsboys' strike.</i>

13:08.255 --> 13:10.488
And it spread
to, like, 14 different cities.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.123
<i>And people weren't able</i>
<i>to buy newspapers.</i>

13:12.125 --> 13:14.793
<i>So finally these bigwig men</i>
<i>were like,</i>

13:14.795 --> 13:16.394
We got to meet
with these kids.

13:16.396 --> 13:20.832
<i>So then--so then they finally</i>
<i>met with Morris Cohen.</i>

13:20.834 --> 13:25.170
Sat down and said,
Hey, what do you want?

13:25.172 --> 13:26.604
And the kids were like,
You have to lower

13:26.606 --> 13:28.406
the price of the newspapers.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.008
And they said,
We're not gonna do that.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.376
And they said,
Okay, well, then you

13:31.378 --> 13:33.611
at least need to
buy back the papers

13:33.613 --> 13:34.846
that we don't sell.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.147
And they said,
Okay, we'll do that.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.483
And the kids were like,
Hoorah!

13:38.485 --> 13:39.784
You know,
you can't mess with us.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.987
We have figured it out.
Da-da-da-daa!

13:42.989 --> 13:43.822
We win.

13:43.824 --> 13:47.058
It was a wonderful,
wonderful time.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.293
<i>Wonderful day.</i>

13:48.295 --> 13:51.863
<i>The newsies united</i>
<i>and created change.</i>

13:51.865 --> 13:55.834
<i>Yay, kids.</i>

13:55.836 --> 13:58.469
You haven't seen
the movie "Newsies"?

13:58.471 --> 13:59.304
There's a lot of dancing.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.105
- How would you
make "Newsies"?

14:01.107 --> 14:03.174
- I would--
<i>- Who would you cast?</i>

14:03.176 --> 14:05.476
- Oh, God,
who would I--Oh.

14:05.478 --> 14:09.347
I would cast--
Oh, my God, One Direction.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.523
- I'm go--I need--
I'm hungry.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.259
Please, all right.
I'm gonna go.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.629
Please, don't
[bleep] around.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.398
God.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.733
No, you don't get
any of this.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.168
- I want some.
- I ordered this,

14:30.170 --> 14:31.636
like, days ago.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.839
Hello. I'm Jen Kirkman
with a fun pillow,

14:34.841 --> 14:38.476
and today we're gonna talk
about the story--

14:38.478 --> 14:41.579
historical story
of Nast,

14:41.581 --> 14:45.016
the political cartoonist,
versus Tweed.

14:45.018 --> 14:48.753
<i>So, um, William Tweed</i>
<i>is known as Boss Tweed,</i>

14:48.755 --> 14:51.055
<i>and he was in</i>
<i>with this group of guys</i>

14:51.057 --> 14:53.391
<i>dubbed Tammany Hall.</i>

14:53.393 --> 14:57.161
So it's all these [bleep]
white guy, fat guy

14:57.163 --> 14:59.430
Congress-[bleep],
and they're like,

14:59.432 --> 15:02.934
We're all in bed,
in the sack, whatever,

15:02.936 --> 15:04.802
up the ass of Boss Tweed.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.838
<i>And people loved him,</i>
<i>because at Christmas,</i>

15:06.840 --> 15:07.872
<i>he gave out turkeys.</i>

15:07.874 --> 15:10.275
Here's your turkey, poor people.
And gifts.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.210
And they're like,
Oh, what's up?

15:12.212 --> 15:13.544
We love him.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.215
So Thomas Nast was
a political cartoonist

15:17.217 --> 15:19.017
<i>for "Harper's Weekly."</i>

15:19.019 --> 15:20.051
<i>It wasn't, like, Garfield.</i>

15:20.053 --> 15:22.754
<i>It was like,</i>
<i>people take him seriously.</i>

15:22.756 --> 15:27.959
Okay, so "The New York Times"
in 1871, they were like,

15:27.961 --> 15:31.529
Hey, we have
hard [bleep] evidence

15:31.531 --> 15:36.834
that Tweed is scamming money
off the bonds in the city,

15:36.836 --> 15:41.172
and he is putting New York
$90 million in debt.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.942
<i>The thing is,</i>
<i>nobody read it.</i>

15:43.944 --> 15:46.110
<i>So--so Nast is like...</i>

15:46.112 --> 15:47.278
Okay, whatevs.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.580
We don't need any more
fat, white guys

15:49.582 --> 15:53.284
coming into our house
stealing our money.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.054
<i>So--so basically Nast,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

15:56.056 --> 15:59.991
<i>portrayed him as like</i>
<i>a [bleep] monster.</i>

15:59.993 --> 16:03.461
His editor was like,
What are you doing this week?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.797
And he's like,
Oh, I'm making Tweed

16:05.799 --> 16:09.767
look like jowly,
fat bag of money,

16:09.769 --> 16:12.437
you know,
under a top hat.

16:12.439 --> 16:16.140
So that was when
Tweed, uh--

16:16.142 --> 16:18.743
that was--Wait. Sorry.
Can I start again?

16:18.745 --> 16:19.677
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- Okay.

16:19.679 --> 16:23.014
That was--
Wait. Hang on.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.717
So he's like,
My constituents are poor.

16:25.719 --> 16:28.319
They don't care
about "The New York Times"

16:28.321 --> 16:29.354
and all that bougie [bleep].

16:29.356 --> 16:32.690
My constituents
don't know how to read.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.625
I'm not afraid
of this article

16:34.627 --> 16:37.328
that blatantly exposes
what I did.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.099
I'm just concerned
with these goddamn pictures,

16:41.101 --> 16:45.303
because the pictures
can tell a story

16:45.305 --> 16:50.341
a lot faster
than all those wordy word can.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.477
So he calls Nast,
and he's like,

16:52.479 --> 16:57.715
Uh, I'll give 100 grand
if you stop

16:57.717 --> 16:58.750
with the [bleep] cartoon.

16:58.752 --> 17:02.620
And Nast goes,
Um, all right, hang on.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.855
Let me think about it.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.190
<i>So Nast gets back</i>
<i>on the phone with Tweed.</i>

17:06.192 --> 17:11.195
<i>He goes,</i>
<i>Hey, I want $500,000</i>

17:11.197 --> 17:12.230
<i>to stop the cartoon.</i>

17:12.232 --> 17:15.933
<i>And Tweed</i>
<i>immediately is like...</i>

17:15.935 --> 17:17.835
Okay.

17:17.837 --> 17:21.406
And then Nast was like...

17:21.408 --> 17:22.974
<i>Dude, psych.</i>

17:22.976 --> 17:26.644
<i>At no price</i>
<i>will I [bleep] stop</i>

17:26.646 --> 17:28.179
<i>doing these cartoons.</i>

17:28.181 --> 17:32.383
So what happens is
he does one more.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.852
<i>It's all</i>
<i>the Tammany Hall guys.</i>

17:34.854 --> 17:36.387
<i>They're all standing</i>
<i>in a circle</i>

17:36.389 --> 17:38.222
<i>pointing at the next one</i>
<i>like...</i>

17:38.224 --> 17:39.257
Who stole the money?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.492
This guy, this guy,
this guy, this guy.

17:41.494 --> 17:45.296
<i>And for some reason, that just</i>
<i>strikes a chord in people.</i>

17:45.298 --> 17:48.466
This is
the power of cartoons.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.634
They're like,
Well, wait.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.803
Maybe he is
stealing our [bleep] money.

17:51.805 --> 17:55.306
Oh, my goodness, I can't,
you know, comply with this.

17:55.308 --> 18:00.645
<i>So nobody voted for Tweed</i>
<i>in the next election,</i>

18:00.647 --> 18:05.650
<i>and because of the cartoons,</i>
<i>he goes to jail</i>

18:05.652 --> 18:08.986
<i>for fraud</i>
<i>and all that [bleep].</i>

18:08.988 --> 18:11.789
<i>So this fat [bleep]</i>
<i>is in jail.</i>

18:11.791 --> 18:13.357
<i>He cannot handle it.</i>

18:13.359 --> 18:17.962
He's like,
I cannot be in prison.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.730
I'm Tweed.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.633
And then he escapes.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.534
<i>So he gets to Spain.</i>

18:23.536 --> 18:28.005
<i>He tries to escape</i>
<i>as a common sailor on a boat,</i>

18:28.007 --> 18:33.811
which is even better
than a non-common man in jail.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.315
<i>But the dudes on the boat</i>
<i>in Spain, they're like...</i>

18:37.317 --> 18:40.685
Hey, dude, this is not...

18:40.687 --> 18:43.387
[sneezing]

18:43.389 --> 18:46.324
Can I get a tissue?
Can I get a tissue?

18:46.326 --> 18:48.893
Can I just do that
before the finish?

18:48.895 --> 18:53.965
[sneezes]
- [laughing] Oh, jeez.

18:53.967 --> 18:54.532
- [laughs]

18:54.534 --> 18:57.902
The Spanish people are like,
We know the cartoons.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.203
<i>But Tweed was like...</i>

18:59.205 --> 19:01.939
[sneezes]
You can't judge me.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.374
They said...

19:03.376 --> 19:06.577
Hey, get out of here, dude.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.613
Go back to America.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.448
Go back to jail.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.582
<i>He did.</i>
