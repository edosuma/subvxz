02:40.452 --> 02:42.329
Go give a treat to Marmalade.

02:42.413 --> 02:43.622
I need to speak with our guest.

02:43.706 --> 02:44.832
But--

02:44.915 --> 02:46.917
I need to speak
with our guest in private.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.289
Is he a friend of Grandpa Epi's?

27:45.373 --> 27:46.374
Kind of.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.752
Was he in jail with him?

27:49.835 --> 27:52.797
He seems like he was in jail.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.134
He's not going to stay, right?

27:58.969 --> 28:00.054
No.

28:01.389 --> 28:02.431
Good.

44:21.034 --> 44:23.078
- Mama?
- Yes?

44:23.119 --> 44:25.580
What's the thing that guy
was talking about?

44:26.873 --> 44:28.458
The perdisco.

44:31.878 --> 44:35.173
It's part of being
in our community.

44:35.256 --> 44:37.634
A rite of passage.

44:38.802 --> 44:40.595
Do you get to have a party?

44:42.847 --> 44:45.308
Kind of.

44:45.392 --> 44:47.769
When will I do mine?

44:47.852 --> 44:49.729
I thought
you weren't interested.

44:49.813 --> 44:52.941
Yesterday you said we should
leave all this behind.

44:53.024 --> 44:54.442
How am I supposed
to be interested

44:54.526 --> 44:55.985
when you never tell me anything?

45:02.158 --> 45:03.451
Grab a bag.

45:03.535 --> 45:05.662
We're going to take a trip.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.664
A trip?

45:07.747 --> 45:09.165
Where are we going?

45:09.249 --> 45:10.208
It's a surprise...

45:10.291 --> 45:13.420
...somewhere far away.

45:29.436 --> 45:31.187
Will it be cold?

45:31.271 --> 45:33.189
Bring a jacket just in case.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.695
- Ready?
- Yes.

45:40.488 --> 45:41.573
Let's go.

45:44.826 --> 45:49.539
If the hotel has room service
can we get shrimp?

45:49.622 --> 45:51.583
Not that way.

45:51.666 --> 45:52.917
Aren't we leaving?

45:53.001 --> 45:54.919
Yes. But we're not
taking the truck.

46:15.148 --> 46:17.484
You said you wanted to know
about our secret?

46:18.860 --> 46:20.153
This is the secret.

46:20.236 --> 46:22.155
I thought I wasn't ready?

46:23.406 --> 46:24.824
Prove me wrong.

46:47.472 --> 46:48.848
Holy shit!

46:48.932 --> 46:49.974
Watch your step.

46:52.894 --> 46:53.895
What's all this?

46:56.022 --> 46:57.023
Wait here.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.610
Okay.

47:01.694 --> 47:03.446
This of it like an elevator...

47:05.114 --> 47:07.367
Except it doesn't move.

47:07.450 --> 47:09.077
We are the ones that move.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.787
That makes no sense.

47:15.375 --> 47:16.459
This is the elevator.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.420
This is going to seem strange.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.006
What is?

47:29.055 --> 47:30.682
What are you doing?

47:30.765 --> 47:33.226
This is how you pick
the destination.

47:39.315 --> 47:41.276
This seems like a dream.

47:41.359 --> 47:42.860
Yes.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.574
It's like I always told you.

47:49.826 --> 47:50.827
That we...

47:53.204 --> 47:55.039
...we are special...

47:56.916 --> 47:59.752
we are not like other people.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.340
We are blessed.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.929
Many, many years ago...

48:13.141 --> 48:15.643
Our family accepted...

48:15.727 --> 48:19.022
a sacred responsibility.

48:23.026 --> 48:25.361
It is our duty...

48:26.779 --> 48:28.906
to take care of...

48:28.990 --> 48:30.199
something...

48:31.618 --> 48:34.495
something
incredibly magnificent.

48:37.332 --> 48:39.917
And you are about to see why.

48:46.341 --> 48:47.634
Go ahead.

48:53.473 --> 48:54.682
Come on.

49:00.855 --> 49:01.856
What happens now?

49:02.607 --> 49:03.608
Come.

49:11.908 --> 49:14.202
Mom, I don't know
if I want to be here.

49:14.285 --> 49:15.536
Give me your hand.

49:17.538 --> 49:18.790
Don't be afraid.

49:34.055 --> 49:35.640
Are you okay? Yes?

49:38.184 --> 49:39.894
What happened?

49:39.977 --> 49:41.521
We took the elevator!

49:43.272 --> 49:44.482
Come on.

49:48.111 --> 49:49.070
Ready?

49:49.153 --> 49:51.989
Now I know what happens, Mom.

49:52.073 --> 49:53.783
Where does this lead?

49:53.866 --> 49:55.618
You will see.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.011
Where are we?

50:14.095 --> 50:15.346
Newark.

50:17.515 --> 50:18.725
Where's that?

50:20.017 --> 50:21.060
In the United States.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.188
The United States?!

50:24.272 --> 50:25.815
That's impossible!

50:25.898 --> 50:27.942
Now you know why it's a secret.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.528
What a secret!

50:33.197 --> 50:36.033
How long have we had this?

50:36.117 --> 50:37.660
Oh, about 300 years.

50:37.744 --> 50:38.745
300 years?!

50:42.874 --> 50:44.333
Hurry, we're running late.

50:52.341 --> 50:54.010
Who is he?

50:59.557 --> 51:01.517
Don't worry.

51:02.977 --> 51:04.479
He's one of us.
