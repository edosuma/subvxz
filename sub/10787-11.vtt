WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:07.875
MAYBE WE'RE TOO EARLY.
MAYBE THE FISH
ARE STILL ASLEEP.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.542
FISH DON'T SLEEP, PACEY.

00:09.542 --> 00:12.083
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY GLAD
WE'RE HANGING OUT, BUT...

00:12.083 --> 00:14.333
DID OUR FIRST JAUNT
TOGETHER IN MONTHS REALLY
HAVE TO BE AT SUNRISE?

00:16.166 --> 00:16.250
OH.

00:18.041 --> 00:19.333
I GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU

00:19.333 --> 00:22.834
THAT
I HAVE A FEELING
WILL KEEP YOU AWAKE.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.834
I LIKE
YOUR SISTER, PACEY.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.417
YOU LIKE HER,
OR YOU LIKE HER  LIKE HER?

00:32.417 --> 00:35.208
I'M TALKING ABOUT
GRETCHEN WITTER,
NOT WINNIE COOPER.

00:37.708 --> 00:40.834
WELL, ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THE FEELINGS
OF FONDNESS AND FELLOWSHIP

00:40.834 --> 00:44.166
THAT NATURALLY FOLLOW
FROM AN OBLIGATORY
MISTLETOE KISS,

00:44.166 --> 00:46.875
OR AM I GOING TO FIND YOU
OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE HOLDING
A BOOM BOX OVER YOUR HEAD?

00:46.875 --> 00:48.208
I'M CRAZY
ABOUT HER.

00:52.959 --> 00:55.792
WELL...YOU'VE HAD
A CRUSH ON HER FOR YEARS.

00:55.792 --> 00:57.041
I MEAN, THAT'S
ALL THIS IS, RIGHT?

00:57.041 --> 00:59.458
NO. THIS IS MORE THAN
A GRADE SCHOOL CRUSH.

00:59.458 --> 01:00.750
AND EVEN THOUGH SHE
WON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT,

01:00.750 --> 01:05.041
I THINK,
ON SOME LEVEL, SHE FEELS
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

01:05.041 --> 01:07.250
IT'S A HELL OF A LOT
TO DIGEST BEFORE
BREAKFAST, DAWSON.

01:07.250 --> 01:10.041
WELL...LAST SPRING,
IF YOU'D COME TO ME

01:10.041 --> 01:11.458
AND JUST TOLD ME
HOW YOU FELT ABOUT JOEY,

01:11.458 --> 01:12.333
IT WOULD
HAVE MADE THINGS
A HELL OF A LOT EASIER.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.917
SO THAT'S
ALL I'M TRYING TO DO.

01:13.917 --> 01:17.208
DAWSON, YOU AND I
ARE FRIENDS.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.750
FRIENDS. BUT SISTERS...
SISTERS ARE...

01:20.750 --> 01:22.000
OFF LIMITS?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.333
YES! SISTERS
ARE OFF LIMITS.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.250
THEY'RE LIKE MOTHERS,
ONLY PRETTY.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.959
I'M NOT ASKING FOR
YOUR PERMISSION, PACE.

01:27.959 --> 01:28.208
I'M JUST
LETTING YOU KNOW.

01:32.875 --> 01:36.041
SO WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

01:36.041 --> 01:37.125
MY PLANS?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.041
YEAH, TO PURSUE
MY SISTER.

01:40.041 --> 01:41.417
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

01:41.417 --> 01:43.041
NOTHING.

01:43.041 --> 01:44.041
NOTHING?

01:44.041 --> 01:45.333
MM-HMM.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.083
WELL, WHAT KIND OF PLAN
IS "NOTHING"?

01:47.083 --> 01:49.417
WELL, I'VE JUST DECIDED
TO LET THINGS PLAY OUT.

01:49.417 --> 01:50.959
IF THERE'S
ONE THING I LEARNED
AFTER LAST SPRING,

01:50.959 --> 01:52.708
IT'S THAT SOME THINGS
CAN'T BE FORCED.

01:54.291 --> 01:56.542
SO THEN
YOUR PLAN WOULD BE
TO NOT HAVE A PLAN.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.875
EXACTLY.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.792
THE TAO OF DAWSON
IS TO DO NOTHING.

02:00.792 --> 02:03.125
I'VE DONE NOTHING
SO FAR AND WE'VE
ALREADY KISSED.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.250
I FIGURE THE BEST
THING I CAN DO

02:05.250 --> 02:06.959
IS JUST KEEP ON
DOING NOTHING.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.041
Pacey:
WHAT'S WITH THE RUSH?

03:01.041 --> 03:02.959
Gretchen:
AT THIS SPEED,
I CAN GET TO SCHOOL,

03:02.959 --> 03:04.333
GRAB MY CAR AND
GET OUT OF THERE
BEFORE DARK.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.500
YOUR CAR HASN'T BEEN
AT SCHOOL FOR MONTHS.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.542
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU DECIDED YOUR FRIENDS

03:07.542 --> 03:09.125
HAVE BORROWED IT
FOR TOO LONG?

03:09.125 --> 03:10.667
FRIEND.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.083
WELL, UM,
ACTUALLY...

03:13.083 --> 03:14.667
EX-BOYFRIEND.

03:14.667 --> 03:15.458
NICK HAS HAD YOUR CAR
THIS WHOLE TIME?

03:17.708 --> 03:19.291
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
LIKED THAT GUY.

03:19.291 --> 03:20.959
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

03:20.959 --> 03:23.083
NICK AND ME?
DOS AMIGOS.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.834
YOU SAT WITH HIM
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS

03:25.834 --> 03:26.959
WHEN I BROUGHT HIM
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:26.959 --> 03:29.041
YEAH, SO I KNOW THAT
HE LIKES THE PATRIOTS,

03:29.041 --> 03:30.125
PRETZELS,
AND A GOOD PARTY.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.917
I KNOW HE'D RATHER SLEEP
AND SAIL THAN STUDY.

03:31.917 --> 03:33.375
PLUS THE MAN HAS
EXCELLENT TASTE IN MUSIC.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.250
HIS FAVORITE SONG
IS FREEBIRD.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.166
YOU JUST DESCRIBED
YOURSELF.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.250
WELL, GREAT MEN
THINK ALIKE.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.417
HA!

03:39.417 --> 03:40.917
I JUST THINK
IT'S WONDERFUL
THAT THE TWO OF YOU

03:40.917 --> 03:42.834
WILL BE ABLE
TO GET TO SPEND SOME
QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

03:42.834 --> 03:45.333
DOES YOUR SUDDEN PROCLIVITY
FOR MY EX-BOYFRIEND

03:45.333 --> 03:48.166
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH A CERTAIN FAIR-HAIRED
PAL OF YOURS?

03:48.166 --> 03:51.041
WHO? DAWSON? NAH.
WHY SHOULD I CARE
ABOUT DAWSON?

03:51.041 --> 03:52.375
YOU ASSURED ME
THAT THAT KISS
MEANT NOTHING.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.375
EVEN THOUGH, YOU KNOW,
IT REALLY DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE NOTHING.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.583
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT KIND OF WENT ON

03:56.583 --> 03:58.500
A LITTLE BIT LONG
TO BE NOTHING.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.875
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
HE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S NOTHING.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.875
BUT IF YOU SAID
IT'S NOTHING,
IT'S NOTHING.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.708
DAWSON AND I
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.291
THAT'S IT. TRUST ME.

04:06.291 --> 04:11.250
OK. GUESS YOU'VE
EARNED MY TRUST.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.291
THIS MUSIC DOESN'T
ENTIRELY SUCK, IT'S...

04:13.291 --> 04:18.875
"GREAT TUNES FOR GRETCHEN.
FROM DAWSON."

04:18.875 --> 04:20.791
THAT WOULD BE LEERY.
SO HE MADE YOU A MIX CD?

04:20.791 --> 04:25.375
AW, HOW SWEET.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.083
DID I EVER MENTION
THAT NICK IS NOT ONLY SMART,

04:27.083 --> 04:28.333
BUT ALSO QUITE HANDSOME?

04:28.333 --> 04:30.750
I MEAN, REALLY,
HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.333
HE WORKS OUT,
DOESN'T HE?

04:32.333 --> 04:35.792
HEY, DID YOU THINK
IT WAS WEIRD WHEN
ANDIE WAS DATING PACEY?

04:35.792 --> 04:37.625
NOT REALLY. WHY?

04:37.625 --> 04:41.250
'CAUSE PACEY REALLY
DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF GRETCHEN AND ME.

04:41.250 --> 04:42.875
WELL, SURE. I MEAN,
SHE'S HIS SISTER

04:42.875 --> 04:44.208
AND YOU'RE HIS--
HIS CLOSE FRIEND.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.333
I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW PACEY WHEN HE
HOOKED UP WITH ANDIE.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.959
BUT IF I HAD TO THINK
ABOUT YOU AND ANDIE,

04:48.959 --> 04:52.375
YOU--LET'S NOT GO THERE.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.500
WELL, DAWSON MAY
HAVE A SISTER
BEFORE LONG.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.917
THEN HE'LL
UNDERSTAND.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.959
OR A BROTHER.
I FIND OUT IN
A COUPLE HOURS, RIGHT?

04:57.959 --> 04:59.458
UH, WELL, NO.
ACTUALLY, HONEY,

04:59.458 --> 05:00.667
WE'VE CHANGED
OUR MIND AGAIN.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.458
I MEAN, SHOULD
WE REALLY USE
TECHNOLOGY

05:02.458 --> 05:03.083
TO CHEAT WHAT
MAY BE LIFE'S

05:03.083 --> 05:05.291
LAST GREAT
MYSTERY?

05:05.291 --> 05:06.291
OR IS IT
ANTICLIMACTIC

05:06.291 --> 05:08.333
TO WAIT UNTIL
THE BABY IS BORN?

05:08.333 --> 05:09.333
HMM.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.375
HMM.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.708
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER
YOU GUYS DECIDE IS FINE.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.291
JUST LET ME KNOW,
SO I CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO

05:13.291 --> 05:15.000
WITH THE PINK AND BLUE
PAINT THAT I HAVE ON HOLD.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.625
GOOD POINT.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.625
COME ON, WE'RE
GOING TO DECIDE
IN THE CAR.

05:18.625 --> 05:19.625
GOOD LUCK.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.291
WHAT'S THAT?

05:31.959 --> 05:33.417
REMEMBER
I TOLD YOU I USED
TO WRITE GRETCHEN

05:33.417 --> 05:34.542
THESE SILLY
LITTLE LETTERS?

05:34.542 --> 05:35.834
YEAH.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.500
THIS IS THE
LAST ONE I WROTE,
ONE I NEVER SENT.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.208
[LAUGHS]

05:40.208 --> 05:42.000
OH, GOD, THIS
IS EMBARRASSING.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.375
I'M ALL GUSHING
AND LOVESICK.

05:43.375 --> 05:47.250
UH-HUH. MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SAY SOME OF THAT TO HER NOW.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.834
NO. I TOLD HER
HOW I FEEL.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.375
NOT LIKE THAT, I BET.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.500
NO, I TOLD HER
LIKE AN ADULT.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.917
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
ACTED MORE LIKE A KID,
YOU MIGHT BE WITH HER.

06:00.375 --> 06:01.917
LAST TIME
I ACTED LIKE A KID
WITH MY FEELINGS,

06:01.917 --> 06:03.000
I ENDED UP TRYING
TO PROVE SOMETHING
IN A BOAT RACE.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
REMEMBER THAT?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.041
OH, YEAH.

06:06.041 --> 06:08.291
NOT MY FINEST MOMENT.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.708
BESIDES, SHE KNOWS
HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER.

06:11.708 --> 06:14.208
YOU KNOW, IF...IF IT'S
MEANT TO BE, IT'LL BE.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.875
IF NOT,
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

06:16.875 --> 06:20.375
HMM. ZEN
AND THE ART OF DATING.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.708
CONGRATS. I THINK YOU'VE
CREATED A NEW MOVEMENT.

06:22.708 --> 06:24.750
YEAH.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
CLOSED FOR RENOVATION.

06:38.375 --> 06:39.542
YOU KNOW,
THIS FREE TIME PRESENTS

06:39.542 --> 06:40.834
SORT OF A STEAK
OR LOBSTER DILEMMA.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.708
NOW, DO I GO CHEERLEADER
OR DRAMA CLUB CHICK
TONIGHT?

06:44.708 --> 06:45.708
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:45.708 --> 06:47.166
MMM. FLIP A COIN.

06:47.166 --> 06:49.542
HEADS IS BIMBO,
TAILS IS SKANK.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.208
WHERE'S THE LOVE, HUH?

06:51.208 --> 06:54.083
AFTER WORKING WITH YOU
FOR THE LAST 6 DAYS,
I DON'T KNOW.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.583
I GUESS I LOST IT.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.583
HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO OBSERVE YOUR SABBATH?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.583
OH, A RELAXING
LITTLE EXPERIENCE

06:59.583 --> 07:01.542
KNOWN AS RESEARCHING
MY ENGLISH TERM PAPER.

07:01.542 --> 07:04.667
LET ME GUESS.
HOW TO KEEP A BOYFRIEND
AND YOUR VIRGINITY

07:04.667 --> 07:06.625
OR THE MANY USES
OF THE HUMAN HAND.

07:06.625 --> 07:11.083
FINALLY A SUBJECT
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.959
OH, VERY GOOD,
JOEY. VERY GOOD.

07:12.959 --> 07:14.500
YOU SEE, THAT IS
WHAT WE REFER TO AS
A COMEBACK OR A RETORT.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.083
I BELIEVE IN FRENCH
IT'S RIPOSTE.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.125
GOOD NEWS, DARLING.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.625
YOUR FATHER'S SPIRIT GUIDE
HAS ALLOWED HIM

07:19.625 --> 07:22.333
TO LEAVE HIS CRYSTALS
AND MEDITATION MAT

07:22.333 --> 07:23.917
LONG ENOUGH TO COME
TO NEW YORK ON BUSINESS,

07:23.917 --> 07:26.750
AND HE WANTS
TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.708
AND THIS IS GOOD NEWS
ON WHAT PLANET?

07:28.708 --> 07:30.542
ON THE PLANET WHERE
CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS

07:30.542 --> 07:31.792
ARE STILL
BEING NEGOTIATED.

07:31.792 --> 07:33.041
HERE'S YOUR BUS TICKET.

07:33.041 --> 07:36.250
I DON'T SUPPOSE
I HAVE ANY CHOICE
IN THIS MATTER?

07:36.250 --> 07:37.750
WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.333
YOU CAN SIT UP FRONT
NEAR THE DRIVER

07:39.333 --> 07:42.041
OR BACK
NEAR THE RESTROOMS.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.083
BON VOYAGE.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.291
SORRY TO STEP
ON YOUR EXIT LINE,

07:50.291 --> 07:52.208
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE'RE FINISHED HERE.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.041
MY STATION
IS CLOSED DOWN.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.542
THESE NEED TO GO INTO
THE STOREROOM TONIGHT.

08:26.458 --> 08:27.834
THIS IS DEFINITELY
MY KIND OF PLACE.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.959
IT'S A PLACE
YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE VERY LITTLE OF.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.834
REMEMBER, WE GET
THE CAR AND WE LEAVE.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.041
IT MIGHT BE
KIND OF DIFFICULT.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.833
NO, IT WON'T.

08:34.833 --> 08:37.250
WELL, IF THAT'S
THE CAR YOU PLAN ON
DRIVING OUT OF HERE,

08:37.250 --> 08:38.457
YES, IT WILL.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.875
THAT LYING JERK.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.207
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FELL
FOR HIS CRAP AGAIN.

08:43.207 --> 08:45.333
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING A LITTLE TOUGH
ON THE LYING JERK?

08:45.333 --> 08:46.500
I'M SURE THERE'S
AN EXPLANATION FOR THAT.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.041
YEAH, THERE ALWAYS IS.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.375
GRETCHEN!

09:08.375 --> 09:10.834
MY GOD,
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

09:10.834 --> 09:11.875
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

09:11.875 --> 09:12.708
I CAN EXPLAIN.

09:12.708 --> 09:14.542
HEY, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.041
ALL RIGHT? I JUST
WANT MY CAR BACK NOW,

09:16.041 --> 09:17.792
AND I WANT TO GET
AS FAR AWAY FROM YOU
AS POSSIBLE.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.291
I KNOW I SAID
EVERYTHING WAS FINE,

09:19.291 --> 09:20.583
BUT THIS MORNING
WHEN I CHECKED,

09:20.583 --> 09:23.041
I NOTICED THAT
THE SOLENOID ASSEMBLY
WAS CLOGGED, SO--

09:23.041 --> 09:24.041
SOLENOID
ASSEMBLY?

09:24.041 --> 09:25.041
IT'S PART
OF THE CARBURETOR.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.041
IT DRAWS AIR
INTO THE--

09:26.041 --> 09:27.333
I KNOW WHAT
THE CARBURETOR IS,

09:27.333 --> 09:28.708
OK, GUYS? AND I KNOW
YOU DON'T NEED

09:28.708 --> 09:29.708
TO REMOVE THE TIRES
TO UNCLOG IT.

09:29.708 --> 09:33.250
REMEMBER ALL YOUR
ROAD TRIPS? LOW TREAD.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.959
I KNEW I RISKED
LOSING YOUR TRUST.

09:35.959 --> 09:38.708
ALL RIGHT? AND FRANKLY,
YOU CAN HATE MY GUTS
ALL YOU WANT.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.875
AND, YEAH, IT HURTS.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.375
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IF
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.667
I COULDN'T
LIVE WITH THAT.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.375
THANKS FOR LOOKING
OUT FOR HER, MAN.

09:47.041 --> 09:50.375
YEAH. NICK TAYLOR
IS A RENOWNED
PROTECTOR OF WOMEN.

09:53.208 --> 09:54.500
HER NAME'S LAURA WOLNER.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.166
SHE'S A JUNIOR
GEOLOGY MAJOR.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.166
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.750
SHE LIVES HERE.
THAT'S HER PROBLEM.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.083
EXCEPT FOR TONIGHT.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.834
ALL RIGHT?
I ASKED HER FOR A FAVOR.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.083
SHE'S GOING TO GO
STAY AT HER MOM'S HOUSE
SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE HER ROOM.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.917
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE,
WE'LL FIX THE CAR LATER
AND YOU'RE GONE.

10:06.917 --> 10:08.333
LISTEN, SINCE
ALL OF YOUR OLD FRIENDS

10:08.333 --> 10:10.041
ARE GOING
TO BE HERE TONIGHT,
I FIGURED YOU'D BE UP LATE.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.875
MIGHT BE NICE
TO HAVE A COMFORTABLE
PLACE TO CRASH.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.417
GOD HELP ME.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.125
LAURA'S ROOM
IS THE FIRST ONE
ON THE LEFT.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.667
BY THE TIME
YOU GET WASHED UP,

10:22.667 --> 10:23.959
ME AND PACEY
WILL HAVE YOU

10:23.959 --> 10:25.000
A NICE MEDIUM-RARE
VEGGIE BURGER
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.375
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME
SO WELL, DON'T YOU?

10:27.375 --> 10:28.625
AS WELL
AS ANY GUY CAN.

10:28.625 --> 10:32.166
YOU LIKE
IMPORTED BEER, PACEY?

10:46.500 --> 10:49.041
I'LL, UH...SEE YOU
TONIGHT, EVELYN.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.125
I CAN HARDLY
WAIT, ARTHUR.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.041
AH.

10:57.542 --> 11:00.625
IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE,
NOT A WORD.

11:05.875 --> 11:06.834
I--I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO, UH...

11:06.834 --> 11:08.333
GIVE THESE CLOTHES
AWAY TO THE CHURCH.

11:08.333 --> 11:12.834
OH, DAWSON, THANK YOU.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.166
SO, UH...

11:14.166 --> 11:18.166
ARE YOU TWO...

11:18.166 --> 11:19.333
ARE YOU TWO DATING?

11:19.333 --> 11:20.500
OH, DAWSON. PLEASE.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.583
AT MY AGE,
ONE DOES NOT DATE.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.375
WELL, IT SOUNDED
LIKE YOU WERE GOING

11:24.375 --> 11:26.083
TO SEE HIM LATER
ON TONIGHT.

11:26.083 --> 11:29.291
WE ARE SIMPLY
HAVING DINNER AT YOUR
PARENTS' RESTAURANT,

11:29.291 --> 11:33.708
AND THEN WE ARE GOING
TO RIALTO 16 TO SEE
ALMOST FAMOUS.

11:33.708 --> 11:36.375
WELL, DINNER AND A MOVIE
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT

11:36.375 --> 11:38.333
IS PRETTY MUCH
A DEFINITION OF A DATE.

11:38.333 --> 11:42.667
SAY, ARE YOU THIS
PROTECTIVE OF JENNIFER?

11:42.667 --> 11:43.667
UH...

11:43.667 --> 11:45.417
JEN IS WELL-VERSED
IN THE PITFALLS

11:45.417 --> 11:46.291
AND PROBLEMS
OF RELATIONSHIPS.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.834
ALTHOUGH I
HAVE NOT FELT THIS WAY

11:48.834 --> 11:50.875
SINCE JENNIFER'S
GRANDFATHER PASSED ON,

11:50.875 --> 11:55.417
I ASSURE YOU,
I ALSO AM WELL-VERSED.

11:56.375 --> 11:59.458
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR CONCERN, DAWSON.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.041
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

12:06.041 --> 12:07.667
DRUE, THE ONLY PROBLEM
I HAVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW

12:07.667 --> 12:10.708
IS THAT I HAVE
TO BE AROUND YOU.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.041
FORTUNATELY,
AS SOON AS I PUT
THESE DISHES AWAY,

12:13.041 --> 12:15.125
I AM ON BREAK
FROM MY PROBLEM.

12:15.792 --> 12:19.208
DON'T TOUCH ME, PLEASE!

12:19.208 --> 12:20.333
IT'S CREEPY ENOUGH
TO BE IN HERE WITH YOU.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.291
FINE.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.959
IF YOU MOVE THOSE BOXES...

12:31.083 --> 12:33.917
WE'LL OPEN IT.
NOT A PROBLEM.

12:33.917 --> 12:34.083
OK?

12:45.417 --> 12:46.708
THIS COULD
BE A PROBLEM.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.750
THERE'S GOT
TO BE ANOTHER WAY OUT.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.834
OH, THERE'S
ANOTHER WAY OUT.

12:57.834 --> 13:01.166
WHEN THE CLEANING
CREW ARRIVES.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.166
MONDAY MORNING.

13:10.417 --> 13:13.959
HELLO? ANYONE THERE?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.000
YOU'RE GOING
TO HURT YOURSELF
IF YOU KEEP DOING THAT.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.750
I'M GOING TO HURT YOU
IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.041
GOING TO FRESHEN
YOUR FACE?

13:21.041 --> 13:22.500
NO. I'M GOING
TO PICK THE LOCK.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.792
AN EYEBROW PENCIL.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.333
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

13:25.333 --> 13:26.375
WHAT, DO I LOOK
LIKE MacGYVER?

13:26.375 --> 13:27.875
NO. HE WAS SMART ENOUGH
NOT TO MOVE A BOX

13:27.875 --> 13:29.375
WHICH WAS
PROPPING OPEN A DOOR.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.458
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:30.458 --> 13:32.291
IF YOU WOULD HAVE
JUST ACCEPTED MY HELP,

13:32.291 --> 13:34.458
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:34.458 --> 13:35.750
NOW I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE STILL A VIRGIN.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.542
YOU HAVE SERIOUS
TRUST ISSUES WITH MEN.

13:38.792 --> 13:41.500
NOT TO MENTION SOME
RATHER DUBIOUS
GROOMING HABITS.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.792
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

13:43.792 --> 13:45.291
I'M TAKING INVENTORY
OF OUR RATIONS.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.000
WE HAVE MY SLIM JIM
TO YOUR 2 ALTOIDS.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.083
WE COULD HAVE A SNACK
AND FRESH BREATH.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.375
IF YOU TRY TO TOUCH ME
OR MY STUFF ONE MORE TIME,

13:51.375 --> 13:53.083
I SWEAR TO GOD, I'M GOING
TO TAKE THIS EYEBROW PENCIL

13:53.083 --> 13:54.625
AND PUT IT
THROUGH YOUR HEART.
AM I BEING CLEAR?

13:54.625 --> 13:55.291
CRYSTAL.

13:55.291 --> 13:58.375
GOOD.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.500
BY THE WAY,
YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY

13:59.500 --> 14:02.291
AND CLEAN OUT
YOUR BRUSH OCCASIONALLY.

14:02.291 --> 14:05.542
IMAGINE AN ENVIRONMENT
WHERE NEARLY THE WHOLE
CITY IS YOUR AGE.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.250
BEER FLOWS
LIKE TAP WATER.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.708
PARTIES ARE UBIQUITOUS
AND ETERNAL.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.458
AND THE WHOLE THING'S
PAID FOR BY CHEAP,

14:11.458 --> 14:13.333
LONG-TERM
GOVERNMENT LOANS.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
THIS IS THE LIFE.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.667
I KNOW. LET'S FACE IT.
HIGH SCHOOL SUCKS.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.208
MAN WAS NOT CREATED
TO SPEND 7 HOURS A DAY,

14:21.208 --> 14:23.875
5 DAYS A WEEK CRAMMED
INTO A TINY DESK.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.166
THE WHOLE SYSTEM
PANDERS TO THE LOWEST
COMMON DENOMINATOR.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.333
STANDARDIZED TESTS.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.000
STANDARDIZED COURSES.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.250
STANDARDIZED LUNCHES.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.083
EXACTLY. AND THAT'S WHY
ANYONE WHO ISN'T STANDARD
DOESN'T FIT IN.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.166
COLLEGE IS
A FRESH START, YOU KNOW?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.792
YOU GET TO BE
WHOEVER YOU WANT TO BE.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.166
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED
TO SEE THE TWO OF YOU
GETTING ALONG?

14:40.166 --> 14:41.875
I LIKE THIS GUY,
GRETCHEN.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.208
2 PEAS IN A POD.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.625
MORE LIKE 2 SLACKERS
IN A TUB.

14:46.750 --> 14:47.792
CARE TO JOIN US
IN THE HEALING WATERS?

14:47.792 --> 14:50.000
IT DOES WONDERS
FOR THE SOUL.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.375
MY SOUL IS JUST FINE.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.417
Girl:
HEY, GRETCHEN.

14:59.417 --> 15:01.041
NO OFFENSE,
BUT I MUST SAY,

15:01.041 --> 15:02.708
ALL OF HER IS FINE.

15:02.708 --> 15:03.834
NO OFFENSE TAKEN.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.166
AND NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,

15:05.166 --> 15:08.708
SHE CAN REALLY USE
A GUY LIKE YOU
IN HER LIFE.

15:08.708 --> 15:09.291
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A GUY IN HER LIFE
BACK HOME?

15:09.291 --> 15:11.250
NOPE.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.667
I'M TELLING YOU,

15:12.667 --> 15:14.125
YOU SHOULD GO
FOR IT, MY FRIEND.

15:16.375 --> 15:19.041
18 YEARS APART?
I MEAN, THAT'S WILD.

15:19.041 --> 15:20.750
WHEN THIS KID
GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL,

15:20.750 --> 15:24.250
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE, LIKE, 36.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.583
HE'S JUST--
WELL, HE OR SHE--

15:26.583 --> 15:28.041
IS JUST GOING TO BE
BEGINNING THEIR LIFE, AND...

15:28.041 --> 15:30.458
YOURS WILL BE
PRETTY MUCH OVER.

15:34.291 --> 15:37.583
AND YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO A WORD THAT I'M SAYING,
ARE YOU, DAWSON?

15:37.583 --> 15:40.750
UH...NO.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.250
SORRY.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.417
OH, WELL.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.500
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:48.917 --> 15:51.625
I'M WORRIED ABOUT GRAMS.
I'M AFRAID SHE'S GOING
TO GET HER HEART BROKEN.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.583
I THOUGHT HER HEART
BELONGED TO THE LORD.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.917
AND POSSIBLY
MR. BROOKS.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.208
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.250
CROTCHETY OLD MR. BROOKS?
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.250
IT'S GETTING TO BE LIKE
ON GOLDEN POND
OVER THERE.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.959
HEY, GOOD FOR HER.
I MEAN, NOW SHE'S GOT

16:03.959 --> 16:05.250
SOMEBODY
TO KEEP HER COMPANY,

16:05.250 --> 16:07.959
TO READ WITH,
BUILD FIRES WITH.

16:07.959 --> 16:12.041
AFTER ALL, SHE
DID SAY THAT "LOVE IS
THE HARDEST OF WOODS."

16:12.041 --> 16:17.375
BROOKS IS SICK, JACK.
HE'S DYING.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.041
OH, GOD.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.250
I DON'T--

16:22.250 --> 16:24.458
I MEAN, AFTER WHAT
HAPPENED WITH HER HUSBAND,

16:24.458 --> 16:27.458
WH--HOW COULD SHE FALL
FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S DYING?

16:27.458 --> 16:28.708
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

16:28.708 --> 16:29.667
HE HASN'T TOLD HER.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.333
WELL, THEN YOU HAVE TO.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.000
ME?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.166
SOMEONE HAS TO.
IF YOU DON'T, I WILL.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.959
IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN
HOW HAPPY SHE WAS.

16:38.959 --> 16:41.458
THE ONLY REASON
SHE'S HAPPY IS BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE TRUTH.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.250
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
NOT SUCH A BAD THING.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.291
OK.

16:47.291 --> 16:48.750
YOU WERE HAPPY
BEFORE YOU FOUND OUT

16:48.750 --> 16:50.500
ABOUT PACEY AND JOEY
SEEING EACH OTHER.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.333
NOW, WOULD YOU HAVE
RATHER STAYED IN THE DARK

16:52.333 --> 16:54.291
OR WOULD YOU HAVE RATHER
SOMEONE COME TO YOU

16:54.291 --> 16:58.583
AND TOLD YOU
THE DIFFICULT TRUTH
AT THE BEGINNING?

17:01.500 --> 17:04.666
IF I WAS THE ONE
IN HERE WITH A SWEATER,
I WOULD SHARE IT.

17:05.750 --> 17:09.333
LET ME THINK
ABOUT IT.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.125
NO.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.500
OK, BUT
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

17:13.500 --> 17:16.083
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO ME, YOU HAVE
MY PERMISSION

17:16.083 --> 17:18.083
TO PURSUE WHATEVER
INDELICATE, THOUGH
LIFE-SUSTAINING,

17:18.083 --> 17:19.290
TASTES-JUST-LIKE-CHICKEN
MEASURES YOU SEE FIT.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.165
I SEE SOME CANS UP THERE.
MAYBE WE CAN DIG UP
SOMETHING TO EAT.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.291
YOU'RE GOING TO FALL
AND BREAK YOUR NECK,

17:29.291 --> 17:31.500
AT WHICH POINT I AM
TAKING YOUR SWEATER.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.959
HEY, I WONDER
WHO THEY'RE GOING TO GET

17:32.959 --> 17:34.166
TO PLAY YOU
IN THE TV VERSION
OF OUR ORDEAL, HUH?

17:34.166 --> 17:36.667
PROBABLY SOME FORMER
TEEN SERIES IDOL

17:36.667 --> 17:37.333
WHO'S TRYING TO BREAK
INTO FEATURES.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.417
WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP?

17:39.417 --> 17:41.291
OK. YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD.

17:41.291 --> 17:42.667
I'M SURE LACEY CHABERT
CAN'T WAIT

17:42.667 --> 17:43.166
TO COP AN ATTITUDE
AND WIN THE EMMY.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.166
ECCH. WE CAN'T EAT THIS.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.417
THIS EXPIRED,
LIKE, WHEN I WAS BORN.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.208
COULD HAVE
JUST SAID THANKS!

18:13.083 --> 18:16.542
MUST BE KIND OF TOUGH
OUT THERE, HUH?

18:16.542 --> 18:17.417
I HAVE A LIFE NOW.

18:17.417 --> 18:20.166
NOW I HAVE FRIENDS,
HAVE A JOB,

18:20.166 --> 18:21.542
GREAT PLACE
BY THE WATER.

18:21.542 --> 18:22.834
COME ON.

18:22.834 --> 18:23.917
YOU DON'T MISS IT
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

18:23.917 --> 18:26.417
THIS? NO WAY.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.708
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

18:27.708 --> 18:28.291
IT'S TRUE.

18:28.291 --> 18:29.708
THERE'S THAT THING.

18:29.708 --> 18:30.875
WHAT THING?

18:30.875 --> 18:32.125
YOU KNOW. THAT
LITTLE THING YOU DO

18:32.125 --> 18:34.208
WHEN YOU'RE HIDING
SOMETHING. YOU STICK
OUT YOUR CHIN.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.417
I DO NOT.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.083
YES, YOU DO.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.166
YOU KNOW WHAT
ALWAYS DROVE ME CRAZY
ABOUT YOU, GRETCHEN?

18:40.417 --> 18:44.542
THAT LITTLE LINE
RIGHT THERE
ON YOUR CHIN.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.166
IT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK, NICK.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.125
WHAT?

18:49.125 --> 18:51.458
DON'T PLAY,
"I'M JUST A SENSITIVE BOY

18:51.458 --> 18:53.083
WHO NEEDS TO BE
UNDERSTOOD" WITH ME.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.041
I'M NOT GOING
TO GO UPSTAIRS TO SEE
YOUR GUITAR, SO DON'T ASK.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.792
IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE
YOU GUYS TOGETHER.
HONESTLY.

18:58.792 --> 19:00.500
HEY, CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT THIS WOMAN

19:00.500 --> 19:03.166
IS STILL SINGLE,
CONSIDERING WHAT
AN AMAZING CATCH SHE IS?

19:03.166 --> 19:04.166
OK, BEFORE YOU TRY
AND SHOW ALL MY TEETH

19:04.166 --> 19:06.041
TO PROVE WHAT GOOD
BREEDING STOCK I AM,

19:06.041 --> 19:08.083
YOU'LL HAVE
TO EXCUSE ME.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.208
YOU KNOW SHE'S CRAZY
ABOUT YOU, RIGHT?

19:15.208 --> 19:16.708
SHE TALKED ABOUT YOU
THE WHOLE RIDE UP HERE.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.125
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
THE TWO OF YOU WERE
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

19:19.125 --> 19:19.250
SO WHATEVER HAPPENED?

19:22.375 --> 19:24.333
OUR LIVES JUST MOVED IN
2 SEPARATE DIRECTIONS.

19:31.583 --> 19:34.667
I THINK I SEE SOMEONE
THAT WANTS TO MOVE
IN YOUR DIRECTION.

19:37.291 --> 19:38.959
I DON'T THINK THAT'D
BE SUCH A GRAND IDEA.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.875
HER NAME'S CHRISTIE.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.166
SHE LIKES HORSES,
WATER SPORTS,

19:43.166 --> 19:43.834
AND BACK RUBS FROM GUYS
JUST LIKE YOU, BUDDY.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.834
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

19:45.834 --> 19:46.917
OH, BUT I CAN GO WRONG.

19:46.917 --> 19:48.792
THERE IS SOMEONE BACK
AT HOME THAT WOULD THINK

19:48.792 --> 19:50.250
THAT THAT'S
A VERY, VERY BAD IDEA.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.041
THAT CERTAIN
SOMEONE HERE?

19:52.041 --> 19:53.166
I DON'T THINK SO.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.583
AND I AM DEFINITELY NOT
GOING TO SAY ANYTHING.

19:56.708 --> 19:58.834
SECOND ROOM UPSTAIRS
TO THE LEFT.

19:58.834 --> 20:02.000
CONDOMS ARE IN THE CIGAR
BOX NEXT TO THE FUTON.

20:02.000 --> 20:02.333
I'M GOING TO GO
TALK TO YOUR SISTER.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.041
NICK--

20:05.041 --> 20:06.667
HEY, DON'T
MENTION IT, MAN.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.917
GUYS LIKE ME AND YOU,
WE GOT TO LOOK OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.458
OH, DAWSON!
COME IN, COME IN.

20:25.834 --> 20:29.333
HI. I'M, UH...
ON MY WAY--

20:29.333 --> 20:30.875
ON MY WAY OVER TO GO,
UH, GO TO MR. BROOKS',

20:30.875 --> 20:33.667
BUT I JUST--

20:33.667 --> 20:35.542
I--WOW!

20:35.542 --> 20:36.500
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

20:36.500 --> 20:40.542
YOU--YOU'RE--
YOU LOOK...BEAUTIFUL.

20:40.542 --> 20:43.375
OH, THANK YOU. I...

20:43.375 --> 20:44.375
WELL, I...

20:44.375 --> 20:45.542
I HOPE THIS DRESS
ISN'T TOO MUCH.

20:45.542 --> 20:49.041
WOULDN'T WANT
ANYONE TO THINK
WE WERE DATING.

20:52.083 --> 20:57.917
UM...GETTING INTO
A NEW RELATIONSHIP
CAN BE INTOXICATING.

20:57.917 --> 21:01.542
I NOTICED YOU AREN'T
BEARING ANY CLOTHES
FOR THE CHURCH,

21:01.542 --> 21:04.417
AND I KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW JENNIFER

21:04.417 --> 21:06.542
IS AWAY AT
A FISHING CONCERT.

21:06.542 --> 21:09.875
UH, PHISH BROKE UP.
IT'S WIDESPREAD PANIC.

21:09.875 --> 21:13.875
HMM. "I KNOW A BANK
WHERE THE WILD THYME BLOWS,

21:13.875 --> 21:19.083
"WHERE OXLIPS AND
THE NODDING VIOLET GROWS."

21:19.083 --> 21:20.917
[CHUCKLES]

21:20.917 --> 21:22.375
OH, DEAR, NOW...

21:22.375 --> 21:25.583
WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT, DAWSON?

21:28.667 --> 21:31.750
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HAVE A GREAT TIME
TONIGHT.

21:37.959 --> 21:41.959
I KNOW HE'S SICK.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.708
YOU DO?

21:43.708 --> 21:45.291
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU
WERE TRYING TO TELL ME?

21:45.291 --> 21:48.291
[SIGHS]
SO HE TOLD YOU?

21:48.291 --> 21:49.959
OF COURSE NOT.

21:49.959 --> 21:53.417
ARTHUR BROOKS WOULDN'T
JUST COME RIGHT OUT
AND TELL SOMEONE THAT.

21:53.417 --> 21:55.083
WELL, THEN
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

21:55.083 --> 21:57.041
I'VE BEEN A NURSE
FOR 47 YEARS

21:57.041 --> 21:59.417
AND A WOMAN A FEW YEARS
LONGER THAN THAT.

21:59.417 --> 22:01.917
BUT IF YOU KNOW,
HOW CAN YOU START
SOMETHING WITH HIM?

22:03.041 --> 22:05.625
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

22:05.625 --> 22:09.667
WE LAUGH TOGETHER,
WE SHARE
THE SAME INTERESTS,

22:09.667 --> 22:11.083
WE LOOK AT LIFE
THE SAME WAY.

22:11.083 --> 22:15.333
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD
IT IS TO FIND A FRIEND
LIKE THAT, DAWSON?

22:15.333 --> 22:18.000
YEAH, I THINK I DO.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.583
UM...I ALSO KNOW
HOW HARD IT CAN BE
WHEN IT DOESN'T LAST.

22:23.417 --> 22:28.917
A MOMENT, A SINGLE
MOMENT OF TRUE JOY

22:28.917 --> 22:32.834
IS MORE POWERFUL THAN
A LIFETIME OF SORROW.

22:36.959 --> 22:39.458
LET ME TELL YA.
YOUR EX PUTS
THE "A" IN HOLE.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.625
THAT MAN IS JUST
A WORLD-CLASS JERK.

22:42.625 --> 22:45.041
I KNOW THAT, PACEY.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU.

22:45.041 --> 22:48.291
WELL, I GUESS WE'VE
BOTH HAD ENOUGH OF HIM
FOR TONIGHT, RIGHT?

22:48.291 --> 22:51.333
YOU DON'T NEED
TO PROTECT ME.

22:52.583 --> 22:55.333
HE'S THE REASON YOU
LEFT SCHOOL, ISN'T HE?

22:55.333 --> 22:57.542
I  AM THE REASON
THAT I LEFT SCHOOL.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.542
SO WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?

23:00.542 --> 23:02.959
NOTHING I DIDN'T
ALLOW TO HAPPEN.

23:02.959 --> 23:05.125
LOOK, IT'S MY FAULT,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.625
I CAN'T JUST BLAME HIM
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

23:07.625 --> 23:08.959
FOR WHAT?

23:13.083 --> 23:13.500
I GOT PREGNANT.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.542
I HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.500
I--I'M SORRY,
GRETCH.

23:28.208 --> 23:31.125
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO FORCE THE TWO
OF YOU BACK TOGETHER.

23:31.125 --> 23:34.875
I AM...SORRY.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.125
SO HOW DID HE REACT
WHEN HE FOUND OUT?

23:38.125 --> 23:42.000
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.125
I DIDN'T WANT TO INTERRUPT
HIS PLANS TO SLEEP WITH
HALF THE THETA HOUSE.

23:48.917 --> 23:50.125
WHAT A DICK.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.834
WHAT A DICK!

23:52.834 --> 23:54.291
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS HANGING OUT
WITH THAT GUY

23:54.291 --> 23:56.458
THINKING
HOW COOL HE WAS.

23:56.458 --> 23:57.625
I AM GONNA--

23:57.625 --> 23:59.458
NO, NO,
YOU ARE NOT!

23:59.458 --> 24:01.750
OK, I AM NOT A VICTIM
HERE, PACEY.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.250
AND I DON'T
WANT HIM TO KNOW.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.625
YOU KNOW, NOBODY KNOWS
ABOUT THIS EXCEPT DAWSON.

24:05.625 --> 24:08.625
YOU TOLD DAWSON LEERY
BEFORE YOU TOLD ME?

24:08.625 --> 24:10.625
HE'S MY FRIEND.

24:10.625 --> 24:12.000
I'M YOUR BROTHER!

24:12.000 --> 24:14.250
WITH A VERY
SPECIFIC IDEA

24:14.250 --> 24:16.291
OF HOW A SISTER
IS SUPPOSED TO BEHAVE.

24:16.291 --> 24:20.125
LOOK,
I LEFT SCHOOL TO WORK
ON WHO I WANT TO BE.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.291
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T TRY FITTING THAT

24:22.291 --> 24:24.208
INTO EVERYBODY ELSE'S IDEA
OF WHAT THAT IS.

24:24.208 --> 24:26.458
YOU KNOW?

24:26.458 --> 24:27.458
FAIR ENOUGH.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.875
AT LEAST YOU NOW KNOW
WHO NICK REALLY IS.

24:29.875 --> 24:33.291
PACEY, EVERYTHING
THAT YOU LIKED ABOUT HIM

24:33.291 --> 24:36.166
I STILL LIKE
ABOUT HIM, TOO.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.166
HEY.
HEY.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.750
DID YOU MISS ME?

24:51.625 --> 24:53.458
GOD, I MISS HER.

24:53.458 --> 24:57.041
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO CUT
THE SCENE BEFORE IT'S OVER.

24:57.041 --> 24:59.417
NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING.

24:59.417 --> 25:01.625
LOOK AT YOUR FACE!
LOOK AT THAT EXPRESSION.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.625
AND THAT SAYS MORE THAN
ANY WORDS EVER COULD.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.834
YOU'RE DEVELOPING
A PRETTY GOOD EYE,
MR. LEERY.

25:08.834 --> 25:11.792
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE
HANGING OUT WITH THE
RIGHT PEOPLE THESE DAYS.

25:11.792 --> 25:14.083
IT WOULD SEEM SO.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.834
BEFORE YOU RUN OFF, UM...

25:15.834 --> 25:17.458
I WONDERED IF YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH SOMETHING.

25:17.458 --> 25:19.333
UH, SURE.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.667
EVELYN RYAN AND I HAVE
BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME
TOGETHER LATELY,

25:21.667 --> 25:26.166
AND I HAVE GROWN
RATHER FOND OF HER.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.000
I'D LIKE HER
TO KNOW THAT.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.333
SO, UH...

25:29.333 --> 25:32.500
DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO MUCH?

25:32.500 --> 25:36.000
UM...I'M NOT THE PERSON
TO TALK TO ABOUT THAT.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.834
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
BOTHER YOU THAT 2 ADULTS
ARE KEEPING COMPANY?

25:39.834 --> 25:44.375
NO, I JUST--I DON'T
THINK IT'S MY PLACE TO
GIVE ADVICE ABOUT THIS.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.667
IS THAT BECAUSE
A DYING MAN JUST TOLD YOU

25:51.667 --> 25:53.750
THAT HE'S FOND
OF A WOMAN WHO'S LIKE
A GRANDMOTHER TO YOU?

25:58.542 --> 26:00.917
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH
WITH HER LATE HUSBAND?

26:00.917 --> 26:02.708
UH-HUH, ACTUALLY, I DO.

26:02.708 --> 26:04.208
WELL, THEN--

26:04.208 --> 26:06.333
IF I CARE ABOUT HER,
HOW COULD I PUT HER
THROUGH ALL THAT AGAIN, HMM?

26:06.333 --> 26:09.125
[SIGHS] EXACTLY.

26:09.125 --> 26:12.041
ONE THING WORSE
THAN THE PAIN OF LOSS

26:12.041 --> 26:14.542
IS THE ACHING VOID
OF INACTION.

26:14.542 --> 26:16.333
SHE'S NOT
THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

26:16.333 --> 26:17.917
SHE KNOWS I'M SICK.

26:17.917 --> 26:21.041
SO...SHE KNOWS,
AND YOU KNOW SHE KNOWS,

26:21.041 --> 26:23.208
AND YET
NEITHER ONE OF YOU HAVE
SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.542
NO NEED.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.708
WHEN YOU GET
TO THE END OF THE RACE,

26:26.708 --> 26:29.041
IT'S BOTH OBVIOUS
AND INEVITABLE.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.583
MAKE NO MISTAKE
ABOUT IT, KID,

26:30.583 --> 26:32.500
GOD INTENDS
TO KILL US ALL.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.834
YOU'LL FIND THAT, UH,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

26:34.834 --> 26:37.458
YOUR LIFE DICTATED
BY THE COSMOS.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.125
YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH THE WRONG WOMAN,

26:39.125 --> 26:42.000
YOU TELL FATE TO PISS OFF,
YOU DON'T LIKE ITS PLANS
FOR YOU.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.333
SURE, THERE'S HEARTACHE
TO BE HAD,

26:45.333 --> 26:50.208
BUT IT'S A SMALL PRICE
TO PAY FOR LIVING AND DYING
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.625
GIVE HER THE EARRINGS.

26:57.625 --> 27:00.041
THANK YOU, KID.

27:02.583 --> 27:04.625
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ME?

27:04.625 --> 27:06.417
RARELY.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.458
CHIN.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.000
OCCASIONALLY.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.875
I THINK ABOUT YOU.

27:10.875 --> 27:12.166
YEAH?

27:12.166 --> 27:13.708
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE LOCKED OURSELVES
IN MY ROOM

27:13.708 --> 27:15.375
AND STUDIED FOR
THAT ASTRONOMY MID-TERM?

27:15.375 --> 27:16.500
[LAUGHS]

27:16.500 --> 27:18.917
WE FAILED THE TEST
THE NEXT DAY.

27:18.917 --> 27:21.458
YES, WE DID.
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT,
WASN'T IT?

27:21.458 --> 27:24.166
WE'VE HAD A LOT
OF GOOD TIMES TOGETHER.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.917
"HAD" BEING
THE OPERATIVE WORD.

27:26.917 --> 27:28.625
WE ARE PAST TENSE.

27:28.625 --> 27:30.166
NO, WE'RE OLD FRIENDS.

27:30.166 --> 27:33.291
AND THE BEST THING
ABOUT OLD FRIENDS
IS THAT THEY KNOW YOU.

27:33.291 --> 27:34.959
THEY KNOW
WHAT MAKES YOU TICK.

27:34.959 --> 27:37.750
THERE ARE
A LOT OF THINGS YOU
DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME, NICK.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.875
A LOT'S HAPPENED TO ME
SINCE I LEFT.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.291
I KNOW YOU'VE GOTTEN
MORE BEAUTIFUL.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.125
DO YOU WANT TO COME UP
TO MY ROOM AND TALK
ABOUT THE REST?

27:45.125 --> 27:46.708
YOU'RE DRUNK.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.458
YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.166
DO YOU EVER CHANGE?

27:51.166 --> 27:53.458
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.375
I MEAN,
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU CAME?

27:55.375 --> 27:56.625
AND DON'T TELL ME IT
WAS TO PICK UP YOUR CAR,

27:56.625 --> 27:58.458
BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:01.959 --> 28:04.834
YOU'VE COME
A LONG DISTANCE.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.875
DON'T YOU WANT TO GO
THE REST OF THE WAY?

28:41.500 --> 28:43.291
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO--

28:43.291 --> 28:44.500
BACK OFF!

28:45.458 --> 28:46.542
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

28:46.542 --> 28:48.291
YEAH. WELL, IF I GET
ANY MORE HELP FROM YOU,

28:48.291 --> 28:50.041
I'LL BE SPENDING MY
FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE
IN TRACTION.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.542
YOU KNOW IF ANYONE SHOULD
BE UPSET, IT SHOULD BE ME.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.750
WHAT? YOU TRIED
TO KILL ME!

28:53.750 --> 28:55.208
YOU TRIED TO KISS ME!

28:55.208 --> 28:57.041
I SAVED YOUR LIFE, OK?

28:57.041 --> 28:58.208
I WAS JUST ACTING
ON THE MOMENT.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.417
YEAH, WELL, SO WAS I.

29:01.208 --> 29:02.959
HOW'D A PRETTY GIRL LIKE
YOU GET SO DAMN MEAN?

29:02.959 --> 29:04.083
I'M NOT MEAN.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.333
ARE YOU KIDDING?

29:05.333 --> 29:07.959
THE BUSBOYS ARE
TERRIFIED OF YOU.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.417
THEY CALL YOU
"EL TORO."

29:11.708 --> 29:14.083
REALLY?

29:14.083 --> 29:19.917
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE USED
TO LIVING ON YOUR OWN,

29:19.917 --> 29:21.375
YOU LEARN HOW
TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,

29:21.375 --> 29:24.959
AND I GUESS YOU
DEVELOP A LITTLE BIT
OF A THICK OUTER SHELL.

29:24.959 --> 29:25.875
AND A PRETTY DECENT
RIGHT CROSS.

29:29.458 --> 29:31.500
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST
YOUR FATHER'S IN PRISON.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.834
HAVING TO SPEND TIME
WITH MY DAD IS LIKE
BEING IN PRISON.

29:34.834 --> 29:37.667
I THOUGHT YOUR DAD
WAS THIS WEALTHY
BUSINESSMAN WHO--

29:37.667 --> 29:39.125
YEAH, WHO SEEMED
LIKE THE COOLEST GUY
IN THE WORLD

29:39.125 --> 29:43.250
UNTIL THE DAY I
DISCOVERED HIM FERVENTLY
STUDYING THE KAMA SUTRA

29:43.250 --> 29:45.458
ON MY MOTHER'S
NEW MEXICAN TILE
KITCHEN FLOOR

29:45.458 --> 29:48.458
WITH SOMEONE WHO
WAS MOST DEFINITELY
NOT MY MOTHER.

30:05.291 --> 30:07.583
BLESS YOU.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.500
JUST KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.625
SO WHERE'S YOUR BEAU
THIS EVENING?

30:14.625 --> 30:17.375
IS HE GOING TO BE
FRANTICALLY CHECKING
HOSPITALS FOR YOU?

30:17.375 --> 30:19.375
HE'S ON A ROAD TRIP
WITH HIS SISTER.

30:19.375 --> 30:22.458
HOW DO YOU STAY
IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOMEONE

30:22.458 --> 30:24.375
WHO IS SO DIFFERENT
FROM YOU?

30:24.375 --> 30:26.000
WE'RE NOT
THAT DIFFERENT.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.625
OH, PLEASE.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.583
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
AND REASONABLE.

30:29.583 --> 30:31.208
HE'S RECKLESS
AND RASH.

30:31.208 --> 30:35.708
YEAH, BUT PART OF HIS
RECKLESSNESS IS THAT HE'S
CONSTANTLY SURPRISING ME.

30:35.708 --> 30:39.750
AND PART OF
HIS RASHNESS IS THAT
HE'S INTENSELY PASSIONATE.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.166
THOSE DIFFERENCES
ARE IMPORTANT.

30:42.166 --> 30:43.959
THEY MAKE FOR
A RICHER RELATIONSHIP.

30:43.959 --> 30:45.375
MAYBE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.959
BUT LAST I HEARD,
HARVARD WASN'T ADMITTING

30:47.959 --> 30:49.500
THE RASH BOYFRIENDS
OF CANDIDATES

30:49.500 --> 30:51.000
JUST TO KEEP THE WORLD'S
CUTEST COUPLE TOGETHER.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.667
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE A BROKEN NOSE

30:52.667 --> 30:53.500
TO GO ALONG
WITH THAT BLACK EYE?

30:53.500 --> 30:55.291
LIGHTEN UP.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.500
LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE
EXPECTING COMPANY.

31:10.542 --> 31:12.542
I MISSED YOU, GRETCHEN.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.291
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.750
WHY?

31:18.750 --> 31:21.125
YOU KNEW THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

31:22.834 --> 31:25.041
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS SINCE YOU LEFT.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.667
I KNOW YOU, GRETCHEN.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.625
I KNOW HOW YOU THINK.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.291
WELL, WHAT AM I THINKING
RIGHT NOW?

31:36.834 --> 31:39.125
YOU'RE THINKING THAT MY ARMS
FEEL AMAZING AROUND YOU.

31:41.375 --> 31:44.291
THAT I FIT YOU
LIKE A PUZZLE PIECE
THAT'S BEEN MISSING.

31:44.291 --> 31:50.291
THAT YOU'LL LOSE YOURSELF
IN ME THE REST OF THE NIGHT

31:50.291 --> 31:52.375
AND NEVER LOOK BACK.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.333
MMM...AHH...

32:10.750 --> 32:13.375
YOU KNOW, THAT USED
TO BE ENOUGH.

32:16.041 --> 32:18.583
I'M WHAT THEY TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM, HUH?

32:18.583 --> 32:20.959
THE COOKIE JAR
HIGH ON THE SHELF.

32:20.959 --> 32:25.417
THE PERSON
THAT'S WRONG FOR YOU.

32:25.417 --> 32:30.083
BUT, SEE, THAT'S WHY
A GIRL LIKE YOU...

32:30.083 --> 32:31.750
WANTS A GUY LIKE ME.

32:41.959 --> 32:45.458
YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.

32:48.125 --> 32:51.917
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I JUST REALIZED?

32:56.458 --> 32:58.250
I'M NOT THAT GIRL
ANYMORE.

33:02.959 --> 33:04.250
NICK?

33:10.500 --> 33:11.625
NICK?

33:11.625 --> 33:14.166
[SNORES]

33:25.667 --> 33:27.834
THANK YOU, NICK TAYLOR.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.667
HEY.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.708
I'VE FINISHED UP
THE WORK ON THE CAR.

33:59.708 --> 34:02.083
AND I FOUND YOUR TIRES.
THEY WERE JUST ON
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.542
ALL YOU NEEDED WAS A
COUPLE OF FLATS PATCHED.
THE TREADS WERE FINE.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.417
THANK YOU.

34:06.417 --> 34:09.750
I FIXED THE CAR. I JUST
WISH I COULD DO THE SAME
THING FOR YOUR LIFE.

34:09.750 --> 34:10.625
PACEY--

34:10.625 --> 34:11.875
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'D FALL

34:11.875 --> 34:14.083
FOR SUCH
A SELF-CENTERED,
EGOCENTRIC JERK LIKE NICK.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.708
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
THAT YOU WERE A CHEERLEADER
ALL DURING HIGH SCHOOL,

34:16.708 --> 34:17.958
AND I KNOW THAT YOU ALWAYS
HAD THE GOOD GRADES

34:17.958 --> 34:19.875
AND THE GOOD BEHAVIOR
AND THE GOOD BOYFRIENDS,

34:19.875 --> 34:22.333
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT MAYBE YOU JUST
GOT A LITTLE TIRED

34:22.333 --> 34:23.667
OF BEING GOOD ALL THE TIME,
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT
PEOPLE GET TEMPTED.

34:23.667 --> 34:26.375
BUT WHY THIS GUY?

34:26.375 --> 34:27.417
HE'S AN ASS!

34:28.375 --> 34:31.041
[SIGHS] I GUESS
IT'S KIND OF MY FAULT.

34:31.041 --> 34:32.458
I PUSHED YOU
INTO THE GUY.

34:32.458 --> 34:33.250
THIS IS
NOT YOUR FAULT.

34:33.250 --> 34:36.417
WELL, IT IS
KINDA MY FAULT.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.708
I WANTED YOU
TO BE WITH HIM.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.500
I WANTED YOU
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY
THAT I UNDERSTOOD.

34:40.500 --> 34:45.417
I WANTED YOU TO BE WITH
SOMEBODY WHO WAS MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE ME.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.750
YOU ARE
NOTHING LIKE NICK.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.458
WELL, REGARDLESS...

34:49.458 --> 34:52.583
YOU DESERVE
SOMEONE WHO'S GOING
TO LISTEN TO YOU

34:52.583 --> 34:53.625
AND COMMIT TO YOU.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.750
YOU DESERVE SOMEONE
WHO'S GOING TO MAKE YOU

34:55.750 --> 34:56.375
THE ABSOLUTE CENTER
OF THEIR UNIVERSE.

34:56.375 --> 34:56.958
YOU DESERVE SOMEBODY--

34:56.958 --> 34:59.917
SOMEONE LIKE DAWSON?

34:59.917 --> 35:02.792
OH...HA HA.

35:02.792 --> 35:03.417
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID.

35:03.417 --> 35:05.458
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.

35:08.125 --> 35:10.375
NOTHING HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT, PACEY.

35:10.375 --> 35:16.000
IT ALMOST DID UNTIL--UNTIL
I REALIZED WHY I CAME HERE.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.917
WELL, DIDN'T YOU
COME HERE TO SEE NICK?

35:18.917 --> 35:21.208
NO. I CAME TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO NICK.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.208
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

35:23.208 --> 35:25.875
GOOD-BYE TO A PART
OF MYSELF THAT I'VE
ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.792
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I GOT THE STRENGTH
TO SAY GOOD-BYE?

35:29.792 --> 35:31.834
FROM YOU.

35:32.959 --> 35:34.542
STARTING WHEN
THEY'RE LITTLE GIRLS,

35:34.542 --> 35:36.291
SISTERS LOOK TO
THEIR BROTHERS FOR CUES

35:36.291 --> 35:37.667
ON HOW THEY
SHOULD BE TREATED.

35:37.667 --> 35:38.583
AND--AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:38.583 --> 35:40.333
I DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN NICK.

35:42.875 --> 35:43.959
AND MY HEART KNOWS THAT

35:43.959 --> 35:45.333
BECAUSE I HAVE A BROTHER
WHO TREATS ME SO WELL.

35:52.959 --> 35:56.333
SO...WAIT.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

35:56.333 --> 35:59.000
DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU
ALSO REALIZE THAT YOU NEED
BETTER MUSIC IN YOUR LIFE?

35:59.000 --> 36:01.458
BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I HAVE THIS PINK FLOYD CD
THAT I THINK YOU'LL LOVE--

36:01.458 --> 36:03.000
THAT'S OK.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.291
THERE'S A CERTAIN CD MIX
THAT I WANT TO LISTEN TO.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.041
OK.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.458
SEE YOU AT HOME.
YES.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.959
SEE YOU BACK THERE.

36:30.959 --> 36:32.959
Dawson: JACK, DO YOU
BELIEVE IN INEVITABILITY?

36:32.959 --> 36:36.208
YOU MEAN, DO I THINK
I BUSTED MY SHOULDER
BECAUSE OF FATE?

36:36.208 --> 36:39.000
YEAH. DO YOU EVER
WONDER IF YOU COULD'VE
CHANGED WHAT HAPPENED?

36:39.000 --> 36:45.166
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ONE.

36:45.166 --> 36:47.500
I MEAN, WHAT IF
I WOULD HAVE CAUGHT
THE BALL DIFFERENTLY?

36:47.500 --> 36:49.083
YOU KNOW, HIT
THE GROUND DIFFERENTLY?

36:49.083 --> 36:50.125
WHAT IF I WOULD
HAVE BRUSHED MY TEETH

36:50.125 --> 36:51.083
3 SECONDS LONGER
THAT MORNING,

36:51.083 --> 36:52.875
ARRIVING TO PRACTICE
2 SECONDS LATER?

36:52.875 --> 36:54.041
AND THE ANSWER?

36:54.041 --> 36:55.708
THE ANSWER IS
I DON'T KNOW.

36:55.708 --> 36:57.708
I'M SICK OF
THINKING ABOUT IT.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.583
THINKING ABOUT IT
IS MORE DEBILITATING
THAN THE INJURY.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.458
BROOKS IS DYING...

37:03.458 --> 37:06.333
AND HE'S ACTIVELY PURSUING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH GRAMS

37:06.333 --> 37:07.708
WHO KNOWS, BUT
DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND.

37:07.708 --> 37:11.625
WELL, MAYBE
HE FINDS STRENGTH
IN TAKING ACTION,

37:11.625 --> 37:14.917
AND MAYBE SHE FINDS
COMFORT IN HER RELIGION.

37:16.291 --> 37:19.708
I MEAN, THE ARBITRARY
NATURE OF LIFE AND LOVE,

37:19.708 --> 37:20.917
YOU KNOW,
IT CAN BE FRIGHTENING.

37:20.917 --> 37:24.542
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN
WAY OF COPING WITH IT.

37:24.542 --> 37:26.375
EVEN YOU.

37:26.375 --> 37:28.208
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

37:28.208 --> 37:30.291
WELL, DON'T YOU
THINK IT'S POSSIBLE,

37:30.291 --> 37:32.208
WHAT'S DRIVING THIS,
UH, THIS TAO OF YOURS

37:32.208 --> 37:33.875
IS NOTHING MORE
THAN FEAR?

37:33.875 --> 37:38.625
I'M JUST TRYING NOT
TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES
I'VE MADE IN THE PAST.

37:38.625 --> 37:41.417
HAS IT EVER OCCURRED
TO YOU, DAWSON-SAN,

37:41.417 --> 37:42.625
THAT MAYBE THEY'RE
NOT MISTAKES AT ALL.

37:42.625 --> 37:45.458
MAYBE
THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

37:45.458 --> 37:46.917
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.

37:46.917 --> 37:50.583
WITH A GIRL
THAT YOU WANTED
WAY BEFORE JOEY POTTER,

37:50.583 --> 37:53.458
HOLDING A LETTER
THAT EXPRESSES EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER.

38:19.959 --> 38:22.625
OH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A NIGHTMARE.

38:22.625 --> 38:24.750
GOOD MORNING
TO YOU, TOO.

38:24.750 --> 38:27.458
DID YOU
ACTUALLY SLEEP?

38:27.458 --> 38:29.625
I COULDN'T.
SOMEONE WAS SAWING
SOME SERIOUS LUMBER.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.125
I DO NOT SNORE.

38:33.125 --> 38:36.000
YOU COULD HAVE LAID WASTE
TO AN ENTIRE NATIONAL FOREST.

38:38.583 --> 38:41.291
I'M SURPRISED
I COULD EVEN SLEEP.

38:41.291 --> 38:43.417
YOU AWARE OF THE 24-HOUR
ANTIPERSPIRANT?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.250
[BUZZING]

38:48.250 --> 38:49.041
WHAT'S THAT BUZZING?

38:49.041 --> 38:52.041
WHAT'S WHAT BUZZING?

38:52.041 --> 38:52.959
THERE'S
SOMETHING BUZZING.

38:52.959 --> 38:55.166
GO BACK TO SLEEP.
YOU'RE DREAMING.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.708
IT'S IN YOUR POCKET.
WHAT IS THAT?

38:56.708 --> 38:58.750
HEY! HEY, I'D LIKE
A DINNER AND A MOVIE
BEFORE WE GET TO THAT.

39:00.166 --> 39:02.500
YOU'VE HAD THIS IN YOUR
POCKET THE WHOLE TIME?

39:02.500 --> 39:03.834
OH, YEAH. I FORGOT.

39:03.834 --> 39:05.917
HELLO?

39:05.917 --> 39:09.333
YES, WE'RE IN THE
BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM.

39:09.333 --> 39:10.417
YOU CAN TALK TO HIM
WHEN YOU GET DOWN HERE.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.875
WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.000
WE'RE SAVED!

39:14.000 --> 39:15.125
YOU ORCHESTRATED
THIS WHOLE THING!

39:15.125 --> 39:17.041
NOW, WHY WOULD I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

39:17.041 --> 39:20.417
BECAUSE YOU ARE A SICK,
TWISTED, PATHOLOGICAL
LITTLE PERVERT.

39:20.417 --> 39:21.500
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'D GO THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE

39:21.500 --> 39:23.000
JUST TO HAVE YOU
FALL ASLEEP ON MY SHOULDER?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.333
WELL, HOW DO I KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING?

39:25.333 --> 39:26.583
I RESENT THAT.

39:26.583 --> 39:27.500
I WAS A COMPLETE
GENTLEMAN.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.417
I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT
PEEK DOWN YOUR SHIRT

39:32.417 --> 39:36.583
AT YOUR EGGSHELL-COLORED,
34C, MAIDENFORM,
WIRE-RIMMED BRA

39:36.583 --> 39:39.291
WITH THE LITTLE
CUTE PINK BOW
IN THE FRONT CLASP.

39:40.125 --> 39:42.000
MOTHER, THANK GOD!

39:42.000 --> 39:43.708
MY GOD!

39:43.708 --> 39:46.917
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TO MY SON?

39:46.917 --> 39:48.375
ASK HIM. IT WAS
ALL HIS DOING.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.959
OH, YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO SUGGEST

39:49.959 --> 39:52.208
THAT MY SON WOULD
RATHER BE LOCKED IN
A CLOSET WITH YOU

39:52.208 --> 39:52.583
THAN SPEND THE WEEKEND
WITH HIS FATHER?

40:00.542 --> 40:02.625
I'LL SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL, DRUE.

40:37.291 --> 40:39.333
Dawson: DEAR GRETCHEN,

40:39.333 --> 40:42.250
I REALLY ENJOYED TALKING
TO YOU IN YOUR ROOM TODAY.

40:42.250 --> 40:45.208
TRY NOT TO BE NERVOUS
ABOUT STARTING HIGH SCHOOL.

40:45.208 --> 40:48.291
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIND
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND YOU.

40:48.291 --> 40:50.583
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO TELL YOU.

40:50.583 --> 40:53.834
THERE'S SOMEONE
TRULY SPECIAL IN MY LIFE

40:53.834 --> 40:56.166
THAT I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT.

40:56.166 --> 40:58.750
SHE'S UNLIKE ANYONE
I'VE EVER MET.

40:58.750 --> 41:01.125
SMART AND FUNNY
AND BEAUTIFUL,

41:01.125 --> 41:02.834
AND JUST KNOWING
THAT SHE'S IN MY LIFE

41:02.834 --> 41:06.166
HAS GIVEN ME THIS
CONSTANT FLUTTERING THAT
KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT.

41:06.166 --> 41:09.834
WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHO
I CAN TALK TO ABOUT THIS,
WHO WILL UNDERSTAND.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.834
THE ONLY PERSON
THAT COMES TO MIND IS YOU.

41:12.834 --> 41:16.834
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM,
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE
THAT I FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT.

41:16.834 --> 41:22.625
I THINK
ABOUT YOU CONSTANTLY,
EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO.

41:22.625 --> 41:25.291
THE ELVIS COSTELLO
STICKER YOU PUT IN
YOUR SPIRAL NOTEBOOK,

41:25.291 --> 41:27.959
THE WAY YOUR BANGS HAVE
GROWN OUT EVERY DAY NOW
FOR 6 MONTHS UNTIL MONDAY

41:27.959 --> 41:32.041
WHEN YOU WERE FINALLY ABLE
TO PUT IT ALL IN A PONYTAIL.

41:32.041 --> 41:36.166
AND TODAY WHEN YOU INVITED
ME TO STAY AND TALK TO YOU
AFTER PACEY LEFT.

41:36.166 --> 41:39.041
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU
MUST THINK ABOUT ME, TOO.

41:39.041 --> 41:43.417
IF I TRIED TO TELL ANYONE
ELSE, THEY WOULD SAY THAT
YOU AND I ARE IMPOSSIBLE,

41:43.417 --> 41:46.041
THAT OUR LIVES
ARE TOO DIFFERENT,

41:46.041 --> 41:48.500
THAT WE COULD NEVER
BE RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.

41:48.500 --> 41:52.583
BUT WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
AND WE CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

41:52.583 --> 41:56.333
AND YEARS FROM NOW,
I BELIEVE THAT WE
STILL WILL.

41:56.333 --> 42:00.333
YOUR FRIEND FOREVER.
LOVE, DAWSON.

42:25.083 --> 42:26.875
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

42:26.875 --> 42:30.875
I HAD A FEW THINGS
TO DO FIRST.
