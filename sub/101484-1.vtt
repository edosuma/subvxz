12:39.046 --> 12:43.184
We've learned shit, like
diversify your portfolio.

12:48.524 --> 12:50.224
I will talk to
Steve at the club.

12:51.259 --> 12:52.093
Thank you.

12:53.161 --> 12:54.896
I'm sorry, I know
he's a douchebag.

12:56.197 --> 12:58.199
He is slimy cocksucker.

13:03.938 --> 13:06.140
Maple syrup goes with
fucking everything.

13:07.175 --> 13:09.210
Honey, I'm not Costco.

13:09.277 --> 13:10.344
I don't do returns.

13:16.918 --> 13:18.119
Oh my God.

13:18.186 --> 13:18.953
Have your parents seen that yet?

13:19.020 --> 13:21.022
Yeah, of course they have.

13:21.088 --> 13:22.089
Now that it's legal

13:22.156 --> 13:23.758
and I've met Prime
Minister hot stuff.

13:23.824 --> 13:25.427
My parents think
I'm a visionary.

13:25.494 --> 13:28.530
I even smoked up with
my mom last week.

13:28.597 --> 13:29.864
It was really special.

13:32.501 --> 13:35.437
Coffee, weed and vinyl.

13:35.504 --> 13:38.306
Yeah, the weekend
hipster trifecta.

13:38.372 --> 13:40.442
And you even made it ethnic.

13:40.509 --> 13:42.243
Like bees to honey.

13:42.310 --> 13:43.110
Fuck, you're smart.

13:43.177 --> 13:45.146
Well, I'll be moving out soon.

13:45.213 --> 13:47.215
But for now, this
serves its purpose

13:47.281 --> 13:49.317
since I do most of
my business online.

13:49.384 --> 13:50.318
That's all they see.

13:50.385 --> 13:51.386
Green health?

13:52.987 --> 13:54.355
Sounds like an Anima.

13:54.423 --> 13:57.925
I need to bring a veneer of
respectability to my business,

13:57.992 --> 13:59.461
especially now that
I'm going legit.

13:59.528 --> 14:00.328
You're opening a store.

14:00.395 --> 14:01.329
No.

14:01.396 --> 14:04.065
I'm now a government
licensed lab.

14:04.131 --> 14:06.167
I'm a micro cultivator.

14:06.234 --> 14:07.335
You are?

14:07.402 --> 14:09.438
Yeah, I'm the poster
child for a new day,

14:09.504 --> 14:11.872
and I'm gonna grow
like Jeff Bezos.

14:11.939 --> 14:14.576
I'm gonna be the Amazon of weed.

14:14.643 --> 14:18.145
Well, great, then you can
buy my stuff back no problem.

14:18.212 --> 14:20.147
I'll even take a
hit on the buyback.

14:20.214 --> 14:22.350
I know this is a weird request.

14:22.417 --> 14:27.054
But I've always been loyal
and most of my people left

14:27.121 --> 14:30.358
so I just need to
get back on my feet.

14:30.425 --> 14:31.493
I can't.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.361
It's all regulated.

14:33.428 --> 14:35.896
I make one misstep,
they pull my license.

14:35.963 --> 14:37.164
Fuck, really?

14:38.132 --> 14:38.899
What if I sell it back to you?

14:38.966 --> 14:40.569
30% below what I paid for it.

14:40.636 --> 14:42.270
You're making a
profit on a profit.

14:42.336 --> 14:43.904
Isn't that like your mantra?

14:45.006 --> 14:47.842
My mantra, I'm
brown, I'm a woman.

14:47.908 --> 14:48.943
I'm gonna get screwed.

14:49.010 --> 14:51.045
So always look for
the next opportunity.

14:54.915 --> 14:57.486
But you sold me all this.

14:58.587 --> 15:00.489
And you're the one
who had a great plan.

15:00.555 --> 15:02.923
Listen, Adeela I need this.

15:02.990 --> 15:04.258
If I can't make rent,
I'm out on my ass

15:04.325 --> 15:06.927
and people aren't buying the
way I thought they would.

15:06.994 --> 15:08.262
Look,

15:08.329 --> 15:10.064
remember when we first
started dealing in university,

15:10.131 --> 15:11.433
we said that it was
to pay our bills

15:11.500 --> 15:13.535
and to create our
own opportunities.

15:13.602 --> 15:16.337
No, we said it was so we
could smoke weed for free.

15:17.271 --> 15:18.172
True.

15:18.239 --> 15:19.340
But once we started
making money,

15:19.408 --> 15:22.310
we said that it was to
avoid having a desk job.

15:22.377 --> 15:23.144
Remember?

15:23.210 --> 15:25.046
You were gonna go and travel

15:25.112 --> 15:28.883
and help save people
and animals and shit

15:28.949 --> 15:30.619
because you feel guilty
about your privilege.

15:30.686 --> 15:33.888
And I was gonna make money
off of people like you.

15:33.954 --> 15:36.057
But I love dealing.

15:36.123 --> 15:37.224
I'm good at it.

15:38.593 --> 15:40.961
Then find a new opportunity.

15:41.028 --> 15:42.664
This is our time.

15:42.731 --> 15:44.932
Dealing weed is like the mullet.

15:44.999 --> 15:47.068
It's dead and it's
not coming back.

15:47.134 --> 15:49.236
It was a fun ride while
it lasted partner.

15:49.303 --> 15:52.239
But now, it's time
for some tough love.

16:55.470 --> 16:56.203
Sorry I'm late.

16:56.270 --> 16:57.506
We are busy at the store.

16:57.572 --> 17:00.274
We open on Monday and I'm
still filling positions in.

17:02.109 --> 17:04.378
Can't believe I got
an interview so fast.

17:04.445 --> 17:05.414
Indeed.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.914
So you are?

17:11.185 --> 17:12.387
Anne Banting.

17:13.488 --> 17:15.055
The microphone's
not necessary.

17:16.525 --> 17:18.660
Anne Banting, yes.

17:18.727 --> 17:22.195
The software we use put
you at the top of our list.

17:23.164 --> 17:24.031
Wow!

17:25.232 --> 17:26.099
So,

17:27.268 --> 17:29.336
have you been working
for the government long?

17:32.173 --> 17:33.174
Thank you for asking.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.009
Yes, I worked with
the LCBO part time

17:35.075 --> 17:36.445
when I was in high school

17:36.511 --> 17:38.480
and then I moved
up to full time.

17:38.547 --> 17:41.282
In 1927, the
Government of Ontario

17:41.348 --> 17:44.786
created the LCBO, selling
all the liquor you need

17:44.853 --> 17:47.556
to let down your guard
after a hard day,

17:47.622 --> 17:50.991
being accepting of everyone
and apologizing for everything.

17:52.126 --> 17:54.028
And then I worked
with the Beer Store.

17:54.094 --> 17:57.031
The Government of Ontario
helped create the Beer Store,

17:57.097 --> 17:59.801
allowing all of us to live up
to the Canadian stereotypes

17:59.868 --> 18:04.071
of loving plaid, hockey and
knowing some guy named Doug.

18:04.138 --> 18:08.443
And then I saw an opportunity
to move up with CDCBO.

18:08.510 --> 18:11.580
But we know Canada is a
country full of diverse people

18:11.646 --> 18:15.784
and vices and we're proud
to announce the CDCBO,

18:15.851 --> 18:19.320
the Cannabis Distribution
and Control Board of Ontario.

18:19.387 --> 18:21.121
You heard it correctly Ontario,

18:21.188 --> 18:23.224
your government is sparking up.

18:23.892 --> 18:25.059
Full stop.

18:28.530 --> 18:30.632
Such different products.

18:30.699 --> 18:31.999
I can hear you fine.

18:35.770 --> 18:36.505
I mean, are they?

18:36.571 --> 18:38.473
It's all the same poison.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.575
I believe Snoop Dogg said
it best when he said,

18:40.642 --> 18:43.512
it makes me feel the
way I need to feel.

18:46.748 --> 18:49.618
I think he was just
talking about cannabis but...

18:49.684 --> 18:52.219
That's one person's
opinion truthfully,

18:52.286 --> 18:55.222
and he is a multi
layered artist.

18:55.289 --> 18:56.758
Genius in my mind.

18:58.158 --> 19:01.328
All right, so tell
me about yourself.

19:03.431 --> 19:05.467
Well, I'm very excited
about this opportunity.

19:05.534 --> 19:07.469
I think it's been a
very long time coming.

19:07.536 --> 19:10.572
And what makes you
a unique candidate?

19:10.639 --> 19:11.740
Do you hate Bob Marley?

19:15.710 --> 19:17.412
Well, I have a
degree in economics,

19:17.479 --> 19:21.583
and I've had my own
business since university.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.518
Oh, that's impressive.

19:23.585 --> 19:25.520
Yeah, I've been my
own boss since then.

19:25.587 --> 19:26.855
And it's been a
lot of hard work,

19:26.922 --> 19:30.190
keeping my clients happy with
all the choice out there.

19:30.257 --> 19:32.594
So why do you wanna
work with the CDCBO?

19:34.663 --> 19:35.931
See sometimes it's appropriate.

19:37.666 --> 19:39.868
Well, like you I thought
I'd get in on the ground floor

19:39.935 --> 19:42.637
of a company that's
gonna grow very quickly.

19:42.704 --> 19:44.639
I mean 40 stores in
Ontario isn't enough

19:44.706 --> 19:46.541
to match the demand.

19:46.608 --> 19:47.475
Right.

19:49.209 --> 19:52.279
So it says here that
you are a weed dealer.

19:56.851 --> 19:58.753
Cannabis, yeah.

19:59.754 --> 20:00.822
That works.

20:00.889 --> 20:01.856
That's the time that
the microphone works.

20:01.923 --> 20:04.492
I think it's a
perfect fit really.

20:04.559 --> 20:05.927
I'm well versed in every strain,

20:05.994 --> 20:08.228
I know the effects of each one.

20:08.295 --> 20:10.230
And I persevere to
find the right strain

20:10.297 --> 20:11.365
for each of my customers.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.568
And I think if given the chance,

20:13.635 --> 20:15.369
I could do the same for yours.

20:15.437 --> 20:16.738
Yeah, stop talking.

20:16.805 --> 20:19.239
You are aware that this is a
government position, right?

20:20.240 --> 20:21.108
Yeah.

20:22.142 --> 20:23.578
And you're applying
for a position

20:23.645 --> 20:25.413
as an admitted criminal.

20:25.480 --> 20:29.551
I feel like this is
appropriate, admitted criminal.

20:30.785 --> 20:35.790
See, I took a class on this.

20:38.693 --> 20:39.761
Admitted criminal.

20:42.430 --> 20:43.632
Not after this weekend.

20:46.367 --> 20:47.201
Touche.

20:52.741 --> 20:55.577
I can see why the software
gave you a 99% match,

20:55.644 --> 20:56.511
that's for sure.

20:59.547 --> 21:04.552
Well Anne, if I move your
application to the next phase,

21:05.285 --> 21:06.353
Ralph's gonna flag it.

21:06.421 --> 21:07.354
Ralph?

21:07.422 --> 21:08.288
My boss.

21:08.355 --> 21:09.424
He's a dog person.

21:09.491 --> 21:10.959
Don't get me started.

21:11.026 --> 21:12.794
I'll take it off
my application.

21:12.861 --> 21:14.629
And then you'll look like
you're unemployed for 10 years.

21:14.696 --> 21:15.864
That's not great.

21:15.930 --> 21:17.532
Yeah, but drug free.

21:18.700 --> 21:19.567
Oh fuck it.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.307
Welcome to CDCBO.

21:27.374 --> 21:29.644
You start 8 a.m. Monday
and if anyone asks,

21:29.711 --> 21:31.780
you've been living in a
commune in BC for 10 years,

21:31.846 --> 21:32.781
all right?

21:32.847 --> 21:33.715
Thank you.

21:35.784 --> 21:37.351
Yeah.

21:37.419 --> 21:39.186
Takes your breath
away, doesn't it?

21:41.089 --> 21:42.322
A tie.

21:42.390 --> 21:43.925
Yeah, nothing but a G thang.

22:01.443 --> 22:02.309
Fuck!

22:31.740 --> 22:34.008
(SAD MUSIC)

23:26.628 --> 23:28.630
I love your new place.

23:29.764 --> 23:31.032
It must get a lot
of great light.

23:32.467 --> 23:33.434
Very funny.

23:34.669 --> 23:36.404
Hey, what do
you think of that?

23:38.006 --> 23:39.808
Hey, my old work tie.

23:42.443 --> 23:43.310
I wish it was.

23:46.114 --> 23:47.782
Yours?

23:47.849 --> 23:48.716
That's good.

23:52.854 --> 23:54.923
Finally putting that
education to good use.

23:58.059 --> 23:58.927
Yeah, I guess so.

24:01.629 --> 24:02.764
It couldn't last
forever, could it?

24:02.831 --> 24:05.332
I really didn't think
it would end like this.

24:06.467 --> 24:08.368
Well, you didn't
choose an easy path.

24:10.471 --> 24:11.406
Or maybe you did.

24:12.807 --> 24:13.808
It needs more green.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.510
You sound like mom.

24:15.577 --> 24:16.778
Hey, I'm on your side.

24:29.757 --> 24:30.625
Fuck it.

24:33.795 --> 24:35.530
I'm not working for the enemy.

24:35.597 --> 24:37.465
That's my girl.

24:37.532 --> 24:39.567
Let's hear it for the crazy one!

24:39.634 --> 24:40.501
Woo!

24:41.970 --> 24:45.440
(UPBEAT ELECTRIC MUSIC)

25:01.589 --> 25:03.591
Hey, do you think my hair
will stay when we're fucking?

25:03.658 --> 25:04.659
Oh, I think so.

25:06.928 --> 25:09.664
Ah, you are a
lifesaver as always girl.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.904
And do you have anything
that'll help us out?

25:18.673 --> 25:20.541
This should put you
both in the right mood.

25:20.608 --> 25:22.844
I don't need him to
go limp and pass out.

25:22.911 --> 25:24.212
I need him to go all night.

25:28.149 --> 25:29.751
Yes, bitch.

25:29.817 --> 25:30.818
That is what I'm talking about.

25:30.885 --> 25:32.787
You always know how
to hook a girl up.

25:34.055 --> 25:37.225
Not to interrupt, weed doesn't
actually make you go limp.

25:37.292 --> 25:38.159
Coke does.

25:40.561 --> 25:41.397
Okay, whatever.

25:44.966 --> 25:45.733
I tried.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.201
And a valiant effort, okay.

25:47.268 --> 25:48.903
Did you talk to Steve?

25:48.970 --> 25:49.871
He's upstairs.

25:50.972 --> 25:52.140
What is going on in here?

25:52.206 --> 25:53.207
What's with all the backpacks?

25:53.274 --> 25:54.242
Is this like a weed
dealer convention?

25:54.309 --> 25:56.744
It's more like
an employment fair.

25:57.979 --> 25:58.813
Thanks.

26:19.867 --> 26:20.735
Hello.

26:28.843 --> 26:29.510
Hello.

26:30.678 --> 26:34.515
Oh, sorry, is Steve here?

26:35.683 --> 26:37.185
Steve.

26:37.251 --> 26:40.021
Steve's downstairs playing
the role he's paid to play.

26:40.888 --> 26:41.756
Sorry.

26:43.091 --> 26:46.094
Everybody wants to come
to a club run by mobsters.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.229
So we give them one ride
at a central casting

26:48.296 --> 26:50.064
and they go home
with a fun story.

26:51.232 --> 26:53.267
Guess who's coming back
with friends next week?

26:56.637 --> 26:59.774
You're best friend Anne, right?

26:59.841 --> 27:00.708
Yeah.

27:01.410 --> 27:02.977
Yeah.

27:03.044 --> 27:05.279
Steve mentioned
you'd be coming by.

27:05.346 --> 27:06.948
I like Beth.

27:07.015 --> 27:08.916
Gotta love Steve's optimism.

27:14.922 --> 27:17.759
He also mentioned you're
looking for a new line of work.

27:19.260 --> 27:23.031
Yeah, I'm looking
to expand my reach

27:23.097 --> 27:26.134
and navigate the new terrain.

27:27.869 --> 27:30.671
Governments always
make the best gangsters.

27:30.738 --> 27:32.807
If I was bilingual,
I'd be prime minister.

27:39.714 --> 27:42.016
One would think you'd
find a more discreet way

27:42.083 --> 27:45.119
than a backpack to
carry around your drugs.

27:45.186 --> 27:46.587
This isn't Degrassi.

27:48.890 --> 27:52.260

my situation?

27:53.294 --> 27:54.695
My product?

27:55.797 --> 27:57.565
Have you ever
dealt anything else?

27:58.699 --> 28:03.571
No, weed is a good
fit for my skill set.

28:05.173 --> 28:06.340
You're a purist.

28:07.341 --> 28:08.209
Exactly.

28:09.844 --> 28:12.313
We just developed
a new app for weed.

28:12.381 --> 28:13.881
It's like Tinder.

28:13.948 --> 28:15.116
I'm so excited about it.

28:15.183 --> 28:17.051
We even have a loyalty program.

28:18.853 --> 28:21.022
Even with legalization the
government's not gonna be able

28:21.089 --> 28:23.324
to keep up with demand
and they close at five.

28:25.827 --> 28:26.994
Times are changing.

28:28.262 --> 28:30.031
So why did you
stick to dealing?

28:31.365 --> 28:33.134
You could have
worked your way up.

28:34.268 --> 28:36.237
You're paid a lot more
money distributing.

28:38.773 --> 28:42.343
I don't know, I guess
I was good where I was.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.682

run as a favor to Beth.

have tons of candidates.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.868
Yeah, but they're
all children.

29:08.970 --> 29:10.838
This is just a game for them.

29:10.905 --> 29:12.974
Dealing makes them
cool, gets them laid,

29:13.040 --> 29:15.009
they still expect
everything from life.

29:17.078 --> 29:17.945
But you,

29:18.980 --> 29:19.847
well,

29:22.283 --> 29:24.118
we're old enough to know better.

29:27.788 --> 29:30.725
I don't know if I can sell
something I don't believe in.

29:31.859 --> 29:33.995
Oh, well we all have
to believe in something.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.064
You're more than welcome
to join the legions

29:37.131 --> 29:39.501
who still believe that
working hard and being polite

29:39.568 --> 29:44.205
will get you ahead but, I
think you know otherwise.

29:45.806 --> 29:47.141
I'm not gonna kill someone.

That's not the skill
set I'm hiring you for.

There's nothing wrong with a
nice secure middle class life.

He wasn't the most
ambitious of men but...

42:46.254 --> 42:49.157
Yeah, but it wasn't his dream,
he wanted to be a painter.

42:50.358 --> 42:51.125
And he was.

42:51.192 --> 42:52.860
It was a nice hobby for him.

42:54.128 --> 42:56.931
Just like dealing weed
could have been for you.

42:56.998 --> 42:58.599
Yeah, but I'm good at it.

42:59.834 --> 43:00.868
That's even better.

43:01.736 --> 43:03.204
Jack was never very good.

43:03.271 --> 43:05.907
Just a lot of
colors and stripes.

43:05.974 --> 43:07.675

43:10.379 --> 43:11.479
how did you know?

43:12.747 --> 43:15.316
I'm your mother and
I'm an intelligent woman.

43:15.384 --> 43:16.452
You think I don't know

43:16.517 --> 43:19.687
why you always carried
around a backpack?

43:19.754 --> 43:21.856
Mum, I'm sorry.

43:21.923 --> 43:22.523
You should be.

43:22.590 --> 43:24.125
I'm so embarrassed.

43:24.192 --> 43:27.228
Adeela's mother
can't stop bragging.

43:27.295 --> 43:28.930
I mean, really Anne?

43:28.997 --> 43:30.832
You could have met Justin,

43:30.898 --> 43:33.801
but you're just
like your father.

43:33.868 --> 43:34.902
Wasting every opportunity

43:34.969 --> 43:36.237
because you have your
head in the clouds.

43:36.304 --> 43:38.706
Yeah, maybe if he and I
had someone supporting us

43:38.773 --> 43:40.108
it would have been different.

43:40.174 --> 43:42.877
Don't assume you know what
goes on behind closed doors.

43:44.645 --> 43:46.748
You'll understand that when
you've shared your life

43:46.814 --> 43:48.149
and your years with someone.

43:49.650 --> 43:51.119
I always supported Jack.

43:52.653 --> 43:54.956
He could have climbed the
ladder if he'd focused

43:55.023 --> 43:58.226
instead of wasting his time
painting in the garage.

43:58.292 --> 44:00.962
No drive, unlike my father,

44:01.029 --> 44:03.264
came to this country
with nothing.

44:03.331 --> 44:06.100
Worked day and night to
make something of himself.

44:06.167 --> 44:08.703
He didn't need
anybody pushing him.

44:08.770 --> 44:10.671
Jack had everything
handed to him.

44:10.738 --> 44:12.273
And he still said no.

44:13.841 --> 44:16.811
You know, I came into this
marriage with expectations

44:16.878 --> 44:18.112
about our future too.

44:19.247 --> 44:20.948
But they didn't seem to count.

44:29.057 --> 44:30.291
Can I stay here tonight?

44:34.430 --> 44:35.863
I haven't made
up the guestroom

44:35.930 --> 44:37.765
and Susan's coming
over for dinner.

44:37.832 --> 44:38.933
Yeah, forget it.

44:39.000 --> 44:39.934
I'll figure it out.

44:40.001 --> 44:40.668
I always do.

44:40.735 --> 44:42.370
Don't be so dramatic.

44:42.438 --> 44:44.272
Don't even think
about blaming me,

44:44.338 --> 44:45.606
I'm not Victor's mother.

45:22.777 --> 45:24.278
It was a nice
comfortable life.

45:27.081 --> 45:29.350
I started as a
clerk at that bank,

45:29.418 --> 45:32.053
could have gone higher,
just wasn't ambitious.

45:33.522 --> 45:36.090
In her mind it was painting

being the bank CEO.

I saw that bank as
a means to an end.

deserve to live in poverty

by on art grants.

I took care of them.

wasn't a good risk

55:43.131 --> 55:44.733
Oh.

55:44.799 --> 55:45.667
My bad.

55:47.635 --> 55:48.837
Catch your breath.

55:50.038 --> 55:51.639
Now try to relax.

55:53.475 --> 55:54.509
There you go.

55:55.643 --> 55:57.612
Good, good, good, good.

56:09.858 --> 56:11.526
What are you doing?

56:13.561 --> 56:14.796
What?

56:14.863 --> 56:16.464
You don't have any more
weed and all I have is coke.

56:16.531 --> 56:17.799
I need to relax.

56:17.866 --> 56:20.869
No, no, no, do not smoke that.

56:20.935 --> 56:22.336
I'm a woman.

56:22.403 --> 56:23.805
I can handle my shit.

56:25.406 --> 56:27.075
Okay, if you have a
bad trip I'm leaving

56:27.142 --> 56:28.610
'cause you guys
deserve each other.

56:28.676 --> 56:30.545
No don't leave,
she'll kill me.

56:35.150 --> 56:36.017
Look at you.

56:39.487 --> 56:42.090
Yeah, it's kinda nice
to have my old life back

56:42.157 --> 56:43.024
for a second.

56:51.533 --> 56:52.834
Have you guys fucked here?

56:54.169 --> 56:55.036
Oh yeah.

56:56.871 --> 56:58.338
Oh, fuck yeah.

REPORTER: They are two of
the country's former top cops.

57:18.626 --> 57:19.961
But how times have changed.

57:20.028 --> 57:22.997
The two former law enforcement
officers have joined forces

57:23.064 --> 57:24.999
and formed a cannabis
base network.

Next.

57:36.945 --> 57:38.379
Yes.

57:38.446 --> 57:41.348
Hi, I'd like to open a cannabis
lab as a micro cultivator.

57:42.917 --> 57:45.119
Do you have the
relevant paperwork?

57:45.186 --> 57:46.921
No, I don't know
where to start.

57:46.988 --> 57:48.823
So I was hoping
that you could help.

57:50.158 --> 57:52.060
You'll need to fill out
an initial request form.

57:52.126 --> 57:54.562
You need to include a business
plan including information

57:54.629 --> 57:57.932
on where the lab is to be
located, preliminary plans.

57:57.999 --> 57:59.400
Do you have those forms?

58:00.535 --> 58:03.071
We're committed
to the environment.

58:03.137 --> 58:05.073
Everything can be
found on our website.

58:06.708 --> 58:09.510
When I just have to
print those forms out,

58:09.577 --> 58:11.446
and then bring them back anyway.

58:11.512 --> 58:13.948
Starting a business is
not for the faint of heart.

58:14.015 --> 58:15.049
Yeah, I know.

58:15.116 --> 58:17.886
I had one until you
guys took it from me.

58:17.952 --> 58:19.888
We do have some
help available.

58:19.954 --> 58:20.822
Really?

58:21.990 --> 58:26.794
You just need to fill
out a 182A-496-697-A,

58:28.029 --> 58:30.698
then you can receive counseling
on starting a business.

58:30.765 --> 58:32.600
Look, I'm a cannabis dealer.

58:32.667 --> 58:34.502
Okay, that's my profession.

58:34.569 --> 58:35.803
And now that it's legal,

58:35.870 --> 58:38.006
shouldn't you guys be helping
me with transitioning?

58:38.072 --> 58:41.676
I mean, I've heard about
all these reprogramming and,

58:41.743 --> 58:44.479
retraining opportunities,
where are those?

58:47.148 --> 58:48.583
Just to be clear,

58:48.650 --> 58:51.686
you're asking whether the
government can help you transition

58:51.753 --> 58:54.522
from the illegal world
to the legal one?

58:55.657 --> 58:58.559
Hey, you guys took
my livelihood from me.

58:58.626 --> 58:59.861
Okay, you owe me.

59:04.232 --> 59:05.566
I think you have
to be on probation

59:05.633 --> 59:06.968
to access those programs.

59:09.203 --> 59:10.705
Have you ever gone to jail?

59:10.772 --> 59:12.507
Are you currently on probation?

59:12.573 --> 59:13.975
I'm not on probation, okay?

59:14.042 --> 59:15.910
Except for working at the CDCBO.

59:15.977 --> 59:18.212
Look, I pay taxes.

59:18.279 --> 59:20.782
Now, you guys work for me.

59:20.848 --> 59:23.718
Shouldn't the government
be encouraging me?

59:23.785 --> 59:26.587
Small business is the
key to Canada flourishing

59:26.654 --> 59:31.059
and women succeeding and
make Canada great again.

Gary.

59:32.927 --> 59:34.562
Gary.

59:34.629 --> 59:36.798
Let's make it great together.

59:36.864 --> 59:38.132
Oh, it's already great.

59:38.199 --> 59:39.167
You better get started.

59:42.003 --> 59:43.705
How many dreams
do you kill a day?

59:45.606 --> 59:46.607
Next.

59:49.177 --> 59:52.246
Right now, you may be
wondering what benefits you get

59:52.313 --> 59:55.950
in exchange for your work
in Ontario's civil service?

59:56.017 --> 59:57.352
Well, there are many of them.

59:57.419 --> 01:00:00.788
And they're all outlined in
your employees' information kit.

01:00:04.058 --> 01:00:06.027
Oh, I hate people.

01:00:06.094 --> 01:00:07.695
I keep telling
them I'm not high.

01:00:07.762 --> 01:00:09.063
I'm not gonna work
when I'm high.

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:10.198
What are you, crazy?

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:12.867
Nice flair.

01:00:12.934 --> 01:00:13.668
Thanks.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:17.071
Are you leaving us so soon?

01:00:17.138 --> 01:00:18.006
What?

01:00:19.374 --> 01:00:20.442
No, I love it here.

01:00:20.508 --> 01:00:25.279
I am so grateful that
you took me on Judy.

01:00:25.346 --> 01:00:27.949
Yeah said with as much
conviction as a 15 year old

01:00:28.016 --> 01:00:28.950
with fake ID.

01:00:29.984 --> 01:00:32.253
Look I know structure
is hard for you

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.590
but you've got a future
here if you want it.

01:00:35.656 --> 01:00:36.458
I don't know, maybe.

01:00:36.524 --> 01:00:38.026
I mean I can't even read this.

01:00:39.193 --> 01:00:40.862
All right let me
have a look, scooch.

01:00:40.928 --> 01:00:42.330
Out you go.

01:00:42.398 --> 01:00:45.099
I've worked with the
government all my life.

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:46.634
But this stuff it's insane.

01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:47.935
Right Jesus,

01:00:48.002 --> 01:00:50.738
the only thing they don't
ask for is an STD test.

01:00:50.805 --> 01:00:52.373
I wouldn't give them one either.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:54.208
Well this is why the
big companies always win.

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:55.343
You can't compete,

01:00:55.411 --> 01:00:57.945
they rig it with all
this crap no offense.

01:00:59.213 --> 01:01:01.549
I wasn't listening
'cause I was thinking,

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:03.718
we should partner.

01:01:06.087 --> 01:01:07.622
Yeah, I could get a grant,

01:01:07.688 --> 01:01:10.291
a new skills grant for
government employees.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.228
We're also women.

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:15.930
We are also women.

01:01:15.997 --> 01:01:19.233
Yeah, I'd forgotten about
that, rookie mistake.

01:01:20.368 --> 01:01:21.836
Okay, 'cause there's
a fund for women

01:01:21.903 --> 01:01:23.905
who run small
businesses as well.

01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:25.706
What else could we get?

01:01:25.773 --> 01:01:27.075
Wow!

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:29.310
Food and beverage, women in
business, leveraging agents,

01:01:29.378 --> 01:01:31.679
market fund, arts grant.

01:01:31.746 --> 01:01:32.947
The arts?

01:01:33.014 --> 01:01:34.782
Yeah, we could pay some
sort of poor artists,

01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:37.118
preferably from the
LGBTQ community.

01:01:37.185 --> 01:01:39.187
Oh my gosh, it'd be great
if they were an immigrant

01:01:39.253 --> 01:01:40.855
or had some sort of
indigenous roots.

01:01:40.922 --> 01:01:42.190
That would be fantastic.

01:01:42.256 --> 01:01:44.092
They'll do all our commercials.

01:01:44.158 --> 01:01:45.461
And forestry?

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:47.995
Yeah, we'll just plant a
bunch of trees around the weed.

01:01:50.264 --> 01:01:51.666
And you've never
been arrested, right?

01:01:51.732 --> 01:01:52.800
No.

01:01:52.867 --> 01:01:54.969
You've spent a night
in jail probably.

01:01:55.036 --> 01:01:55.970
Nada.

01:01:56.037 --> 01:01:57.672
No, surprising.

01:01:57.738 --> 01:02:00.675
Too bad, that's a lot of
money left on the table.

01:02:01.776 --> 01:02:03.077
I know a cop,
maybe he could help.

01:02:03.144 --> 01:02:04.112
No, that would flag it.

01:02:04.178 --> 01:02:05.880
And then by the
time you get out,

01:02:05.947 --> 01:02:07.148
you wouldn't be eligible.

01:02:09.418 --> 01:02:10.051
Okay.

01:02:10.118 --> 01:02:12.286
Gary, City Hall guy,

01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:15.123
he said that I'd have to
make an initial payment.

01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:15.990
He's not wrong.

01:02:16.057 --> 01:02:17.091
It's $30,000.

01:02:17.158 --> 01:02:18.092
Holy shit.

01:02:18.159 --> 01:02:19.227
Yeah.

01:02:19.293 --> 01:02:20.429
And how long is the
application process?

01:02:20.496 --> 01:02:21.696
Not long, right?

01:02:21.762 --> 01:02:22.830
I mean what's six months?

01:02:22.897 --> 01:02:24.365
Half a year, approximately
give or take.

01:02:24.433 --> 01:02:26.435
Will the CDCBO even
sell our product?

01:02:26.502 --> 01:02:28.803
Yeah, probably they
would consider it and then,

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.038
turn it down because they'll
deal with larger growers.

01:02:31.105 --> 01:02:32.707
Yeah, like Shoppers.

01:02:32.773 --> 01:02:33.575
Yeah.

01:02:33.641 --> 01:02:34.942
And then we wouldn't get points.

01:02:35.009 --> 01:02:36.411
Oh, I want my points.

01:02:38.913 --> 01:02:40.382
Yeah, you're right.

01:02:40.449 --> 01:02:42.384
Maybe in the future, right?

01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:43.418
No, because by that time,

01:02:43.485 --> 01:02:44.785
the price of weed
will have gone down

01:02:44.852 --> 01:02:47.855
because all the big companies
will be making it cheaper.

01:02:47.922 --> 01:02:48.723
Yeah.

01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:50.024
I mean, that's how they get you,

01:02:50.091 --> 01:02:52.193
they offer these grants
and you can't access them.

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.562
What about at the CDCBO?

01:02:53.629 --> 01:02:56.130
I mean, with my expertise,
there must be an opportunity.

01:02:56.197 --> 01:02:58.065
I'm gonna stop you there
'cause there absolutely is not.

01:02:58.132 --> 01:02:59.834
It's all about
seniority like Ralph

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.869
and his stupid jerk face dog.

01:03:01.936 --> 01:03:04.439
He's an alcoholic,
not the dog, my boss,

01:03:04.506 --> 01:03:08.009
but he steals stuff from
the company all the time.

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:09.944
And does he gets shown the door?

01:03:10.011 --> 01:03:11.179
No, he doesn't.

01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:13.214
In fact, they're offering
him a treatment plan

01:03:13.281 --> 01:03:15.450
that you and I as
taxpayers pay for.

01:03:15.517 --> 01:03:17.051
It's the worst.

01:03:17.118 --> 01:03:18.219
I'm fucked.

01:03:18.286 --> 01:03:19.521
Yeah, well I mean that
would actually be good

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:22.990
because then you get 12
months paid maternity leave.

01:03:23.057 --> 01:03:25.259
I mean, that's a joke
but not maternity leave,

01:03:25.326 --> 01:03:26.595
because that's not funny.

01:03:26.662 --> 01:03:29.096
Motherhood is absolutely
something to be taken seriously.

01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:34.168
I gotta go.

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.889
Hey doll, wanna hit?

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:55.790
No.

01:03:57.058 --> 01:03:57.892
I'm good.

01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:01.530
How about a brownie?

01:04:01.597 --> 01:04:02.464
I got a brownie.

01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:10.271
The pharmacist said I should
try oils but, what the fuck?

01:04:11.372 --> 01:04:12.206
What am I, a naughty
five year old?

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:14.742
So smoke.

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:18.946
I'm trying but
their stuff is shit.

01:04:19.013 --> 01:04:19.880
Told you.

01:04:20.915 --> 01:04:22.216
Really?

01:04:22.283 --> 01:04:24.819
I'm dying and you're
gonna say I told you so.

01:04:26.354 --> 01:04:27.288
Look what I bought.

01:04:30.626 --> 01:04:31.826
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:04:33.227 --> 01:04:34.895
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:04:34.962 --> 01:04:36.465
It's a glass penis.

01:04:36.531 --> 01:04:37.898
What more is there to say?

01:04:37.965 --> 01:04:39.100
You know what I mean.

01:04:43.204 --> 01:04:46.874
Three months, no
hope, lots of pain.

01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:49.910
You wanna know
what the doc said?

01:04:51.979 --> 01:04:53.448
You've had a good run.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.351
Wow!

01:04:57.419 --> 01:04:58.986
Really?

01:04:59.053 --> 01:05:00.988
I almost kneed
him in the balls.

01:05:01.055 --> 01:05:05.460
That's the whole
point of life asshole.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.194
Doesn't mean I have
to be cool about it

01:05:07.261 --> 01:05:09.063
'cause I'm passing third base.

01:05:11.433 --> 01:05:12.300
Come here.

01:05:21.643 --> 01:05:22.511

stuff to control the pain.

worry about me, okay?

way without saying I'm sorry

just took from me.

01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:03.518
A gangster, that is not
your girlfriend, okay?

01:16:03.584 --> 01:16:04.919
You take too much credit.

01:16:06.988 --> 01:16:08.856
Let the games begin.

01:16:12.293 --> 01:16:15.997
ANNOUNCER: The hours are
long, and the work often dull.

01:16:17.131 --> 01:16:19.500
But the life has many rewards.

01:16:20.335 --> 01:16:21.936
You're respected as a member

01:16:22.003 --> 01:16:23.905
of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.

01:16:30.011 --> 01:16:32.280
Well, there you have it.

01:16:32.347 --> 01:16:35.650
A quick look at the
Ontario government and you,

01:16:35.717 --> 01:16:37.952
obviously in so short a time,

01:16:38.019 --> 01:16:39.854
we couldn't cover
all there is to know

01:16:39.921 --> 01:16:41.789
about the working
relationship between you

01:16:41.856 --> 01:16:43.024
and the government.

01:16:43.091 --> 01:16:45.693
There are still many
other things to consider.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.597
Your employee information kit,
your immediate supervisor,

01:16:49.664 --> 01:16:51.766
and personnel staff
will provide you

01:16:51.833 --> 01:16:54.902
with any additional
information that you desire

01:16:54.969 --> 01:16:57.972
and we hope that this film has
helped you better understand

01:16:58.039 --> 01:17:01.042
your role in Ontario's
civil service.

01:17:02.276 --> 01:17:04.212
Been to a Snoop
Dogg concert too.

01:17:04.278 --> 01:17:07.215
Yeah, it's one of the
best nights of my life.

01:17:07.281 --> 01:17:09.250
I had chosen an outfit

01:17:09.317 --> 01:17:12.086
that was obviously
an attention grabber

01:17:12.153 --> 01:17:14.589
because on the way in a
lot of people were like,

01:17:14.655 --> 01:17:16.357
hey, do you shop at the Gap,

01:17:16.425 --> 01:17:19.193
which makes me think, spiffy.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.097
And my aunt ironically,
was wearing the same thing,

01:17:23.164 --> 01:17:24.665
khakis blue shirt.

01:17:24.732 --> 01:17:26.134
It was just something that we,

01:17:27.668 --> 01:17:30.605
I mean, it wasn't even by
choice, just by chance.

01:17:30.671 --> 01:17:35.676
And we sat next to these two
gentlemen that were cool.

01:17:36.177 --> 01:17:37.145
They were cool.

01:17:37.211 --> 01:17:40.982
They were like NWA,
like that's them.

01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:45.753
And, I always travel
with chocolate.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.955
So that's something that
is just in my nature

01:17:48.022 --> 01:17:50.858
to offer chocolate
to these guys.

01:17:50.925 --> 01:17:53.094
And they're like, no, man.

01:17:53.161 --> 01:17:54.328
I'm cool.

01:17:54.396 --> 01:17:55.563
And I was like,

01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:57.865
you are cool because that's
more Smarties for me.

01:17:57.932 --> 01:17:58.866
That's very cool.

01:17:59.834 --> 01:18:00.935
And at one point they said,

01:18:01.002 --> 01:18:02.703
oh, hip hop's dead.

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:06.240
And I was like,
cool, that's cool.

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:11.979
