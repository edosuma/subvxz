Yes?

Hi. Hi.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.834
Sorry. Um...

02:13.917 --> 02:16.000
My mom is Sara Kingsley.

02:16.083 --> 02:19.000
You dated for a
while in 1989.

02:19.083 --> 02:22.583
She was a cook at a
restaurant you worked at.

02:22.667 --> 02:24.417
Oh, on the night
that photo was taken,

02:24.500 --> 02:25.834
she took you to a
Jane's Addiction show,

02:25.917 --> 02:27.375
but you guys left early

02:27.458 --> 02:29.375
because you refused
to go number two at the club.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.125
Sounds like you.

02:31.208 --> 02:33.375
You didn't have much in common,
but what you did have

02:33.458 --> 02:35.125
was a whole bunch
of unprotected sex.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.250
Sounds like you.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.125
After you guys broke up,
my mom discovered

02:39.208 --> 02:41.125
she was pregnant with me.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.125
I'm your son.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.250
Oh, one more thing.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.125
This is Edie,
your granddaughter.

03:01.917 --> 03:03.208
How the hell?

03:03.291 --> 03:04.917
I'm a grandfath...

03:05.000 --> 03:06.208
I'm a grandf...

03:06.291 --> 03:08.834
I've never even had a gray hair.

03:08.917 --> 03:11.750
I mean, sure, I have always
wanted a family, but have I?

03:11.834 --> 03:14.333
Or was that just some line I've
been using to pick up girls?

03:14.417 --> 03:16.208
It's a great line, by the way.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.709
So when this weird kid
and this baby show up

03:18.792 --> 03:21.959
and ask me in the realest
possible way do I want a family,

03:22.041 --> 03:24.208
well, my answer,
very honestly, is...

03:24.291 --> 03:26.417
I have no idea.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.291
Sounds like you need
some time to process this.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.291
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm
a little stressed out right now.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.125
Reservations are down 15%.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.291
It was probably a mistake,

03:34.375 --> 03:35.500
me just popping in
on you like this.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.625
I'm-I'm gonna go.

03:36.709 --> 03:38.709
Yeah, that's... You know what?

03:38.792 --> 03:40.709
Let me just...
let me just give you my card,

03:40.792 --> 03:42.709
and you text me
your number, and then

03:42.792 --> 03:43.709
we'll get together
when things calm down

03:43.792 --> 03:44.709
a little bit. Is that okay?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.291
Yeah.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.291
It's a beautiful baby.

03:51.375 --> 03:52.500
Thanks.

03:52.583 --> 03:56.000
It's a beautiful...
business card.

04:01.834 --> 04:03.291
What? What's that look for?

04:03.375 --> 04:04.333
What was I supposed to do,
throw him a baseball mitt,

04:04.417 --> 04:05.959
have a catch and sing

04:06.041 --> 04:07.333
"Cat's in the Cradle"
with him? (chuckles)

04:07.417 --> 04:08.417
Am I right, Victor?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.500
White Victor?

04:12.625 --> 04:14.166
No?

04:15.458 --> 04:18.375
Wait! Wait!

04:18.458 --> 04:21.041

was supposed to go.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.583
Everyone, what's the one thing
that I've always said

04:23.667 --> 04:27.375
was missing from my life?

04:27.458 --> 04:28.959
Yes, and the search
continues.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.417
No, I meant a family.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.208
A family.

04:33.291 --> 04:35.208
Everyone,
I'd like you to meet Gerald

04:40.834 --> 04:42.250

What do you have
to say for yourself?

05:20.792 --> 05:23.125
First off, I never kept him
from meeting you.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.333
All he had to do was ask...

05:25.417 --> 05:27.375
Yeah, well, you should've told
me I had a son walking around.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.583

and I met him in a bar?

05:31.458 --> 05:32.500

05:32.583 --> 05:34.250
I'm standing on a porch

about a son
that I didn't know I had.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.667
How could you do this to me?

05:43.750 --> 05:46.041
Have you met you?

05:46.125 --> 05:48.500
The entire time
we dated,

05:48.583 --> 05:50.291
you refused to call
me your girlfriend.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.667
You wouldn't even let me keep
a toothbrush at your place.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.709
You gave me gingivitis.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.250
I did not.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.500
You were proud of

05:57.583 --> 05:59.208
how bad you were
at relationships,

05:59.291 --> 06:02.000
and the only thing that you
ever cared about was your career

06:02.083 --> 06:04.542
and your sex life. Speaking
of which, girlfriend?!

06:04.625 --> 06:06.750
Employee. Lesbian.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.667
Job requirement.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.542
Jimmy, I hope this goes well.
I do.

06:12.625 --> 06:15.166
And I hate being
the scolding, protective

06:15.250 --> 06:17.625
mother stereotype, so I
hope I only have to say this

06:17.709 --> 06:21.291
to you once: If you hurt
my son or his daughter,

06:21.375 --> 06:23.000
I will choke you to death

06:23.083 --> 06:26.667

moisturized hands.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.208
Okay.

06:28.291 --> 06:30.000
Gotta run.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.625
Gerald is in the guesthouse
in the back.

06:32.709 --> 06:35.291
You look great, by the way.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.834

Yeah, I'm on her side.
She's awesome.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.291

07:12.125 --> 07:13.500
Go play. Go play.

07:13.583 --> 07:17.041
Listen, Gerald,
I got to ask you:

07:17.125 --> 07:18.709
Why did you come find me?
Why now?

07:18.792 --> 07:21.583
I just felt like it was time.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.375
Honestly, being fatherless was
never a big deal for me, and...

07:24.458 --> 07:26.667
then the other day, I came
across a BuzzFeed listicle

07:26.750 --> 07:29.166
called "28 Reasons Why
Having a Dad Is the Best,"

07:29.250 --> 07:32.000
and, by number 12, I was crying
so hard I was dehydrated.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.166
Yeah.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.000
We're society's
most worthless people.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.583
Look, I don't know
if I'm cut out to be a father,

07:40.667 --> 07:41.709
much less a...

07:41.792 --> 07:44.083
a grandf...
a grand...

07:44.166 --> 07:47.250
Can I be honest?

07:47.333 --> 07:49.250
(knocking on door)

07:49.333 --> 07:52.250
Hi, Edie. Hey, baby.

07:52.333 --> 07:55.083
Yes. Mommy saw
so many babies today,

07:55.166 --> 07:58.333
and they were all uglier
and stupider than you. Mwah.

07:58.417 --> 08:00.250
What up, G?

08:00.333 --> 08:01.375
Did she...?

08:01.458 --> 08:03.250
Really!

08:03.333 --> 08:04.375
Please tell me you filmed it.

08:04.458 --> 08:06.959
Oh, rock star. Awesome.

08:07.041 --> 08:10.166
Oh, I totally lost
her little rubber ducky.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.208
Oh, uh, I made one.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.959
(sighs)
You are good.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.250
You know, one of these days,
you're gonna be

08:16.333 --> 08:18.250
the billionaire
3-D printing designer guy,

08:18.333 --> 08:21.041
and I'm gonna be like,
"That's my friend."

08:21.125 --> 08:23.333
All right, I got to go.

08:23.417 --> 08:25.333
There's a really tan guy
in the back of the house.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.667
He's hot,
but he's old. Bye.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.500
Okay. I'll, uh, text you.

08:29.583 --> 08:31.417
And-and then...
(clears throat)

08:32.417 --> 08:34.333
(chuckles)

08:34.417 --> 08:37.333
Okay, there-there's one reason
I wanted to meet you.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.125
Uh, that was Vanessa.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.125
I would love it
if she stopped thinking of me

08:41.208 --> 08:43.125
as a friend who happened
to cause a human being

08:43.208 --> 08:45.291
to pop out of her uterus...

08:45.375 --> 08:47.333
and start seeing me as someone
she could actually date.

08:47.417 --> 08:49.333
My mom told me
your whole deal, and,

08:49.417 --> 08:52.542
I don't know, I thought
you could give me some pointers?

08:52.625 --> 08:55.500
Oh. Why didn't you say so?
I could help you with that.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.250
Yeah?

08:57.333 --> 08:59.250
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for it.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.333
Come on.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.583
Hey, you don't think
I'm too tan, do you?

09:05.667 --> 09:07.875
No, you're perfect.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.000
(indistinct chatter)

09:11.083 --> 09:13.041
Vanessa and I worked
in the same cell phone store.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.542
I was attracted to
her fearless way, just sort of

09:15.625 --> 09:18.625
bulldozing through life,
and she was attracted
to my friend Ethan.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.792
Uh-huh.
But, one night,
she got her cell phone stolen

09:20.875 --> 09:23.625
and I helped her trace it.
Finally got it back

09:23.709 --> 09:26.667
at 4:00 a.m. in Temecula,
and then we... slept together.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.417
Twice.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.625
Just once.

09:29.709 --> 09:30.625
Huh.

09:30.709 --> 09:33.625
♪ ♪

09:33.709 --> 09:37.000
I'm gonna make an observation
that might explain

09:37.083 --> 09:38.333
why Vanessa isn't
attracted to you.

09:38.417 --> 09:39.834
Okay.

09:39.917 --> 09:42.041
It appears that you only
have one set of clothing.

09:42.125 --> 09:44.583
I-I wear a green hoodie
every day because thinking

09:44.667 --> 09:46.709
about clothes
creates decision fatigue.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.500
That's why Mark Zuckerberg
only wears gray T-shirts.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.709
Saves you mental energy
to focus on work.

09:50.792 --> 09:54.291
What do you do for work?

09:54.375 --> 09:56.125
I crush it at this.
I posted a video,

09:56.208 --> 09:57.542
and it's the highest-rated
instructional diapering video

09:57.625 --> 09:58.792
on YouTube.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.709
I'm so sorry.

10:00.792 --> 10:03.417
Oh, wait,
you were bragging?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.208
Women are complicated,
you know?

10:05.291 --> 10:08.083
They-they want men
to come in and...

10:08.166 --> 10:11.542
and-and take what's complicated
and uncomplicate it.

10:11.625 --> 10:14.792
Right. No, that's-that's
good advice. Thank you.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.333
Also, you know, the G-spot...

10:17.417 --> 10:20.041
No. Mm-mm.

10:21.208 --> 10:23.542
Okay, where is it?

10:23.625 --> 10:24.917
You know, I was
in love once.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.500
Just one time.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.083
I actually thought
I'd marry her.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.667
We had these dumb little
pet names for each other.

10:30.750 --> 10:33.291
She was Sushi, and
I was Ponyboy.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.625
I love sushi.

10:34.709 --> 10:36.792
Then one day, uh,
she just left.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.792
Sushi kind of wrecked me.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.792
Sounds pretty rough, Dad.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.250
Not ready for "Dad."
Oh.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.792
Boy, look at the job
I did on you.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.458
That was no ordinary
diaper change.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.417
That was like staring
into the mouth of Hell.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.792
(baby fusses)

10:49.875 --> 10:51.250
What did you eat,
a squirrel?

10:51.333 --> 10:54.250
Why are you changing
that baby?

10:54.333 --> 10:55.792
GERALD:
Oh, coo, coo. Coo, coo.

10:55.875 --> 10:58.083
So... how am I doing?

10:58.166 --> 10:59.792
What? Fatherhood?

10:59.875 --> 11:01.125
Uh, good.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.750
Right? What's next?

11:02.834 --> 11:04.583
Oh, uh, well, I got to go home.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.250
Yeah, every Friday night, I
watch a movie at home with Mom.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.041
That's the saddest sentence
I've ever heard.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.000
It's like a poem.

11:12.875 --> 11:15.000
What movie?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.458
Daddy, look!

11:16.542 --> 11:18.583
Billy!

11:18.667 --> 11:19.875
(crying)

11:19.959 --> 11:21.792
Hold it! Hold it!

11:21.875 --> 11:23.375
(horns honking,
tires screeching, Sara crying)

11:23.458 --> 11:24.917
(phone chimes)

11:25.000 --> 11:28.875
Damn it! Deion Sanders chose
Bistro 6 instead of us.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.792
It's a whole thing.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.417
(scoffs)

11:32.500 --> 11:33.792
This scene is ridiculous,
anyway.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.208
I mean, running
a kid through traffic

11:35.291 --> 11:37.875
is-is more dangerous
than the fall was.

11:37.959 --> 11:40.208
Just call an ambulance, dummy!

11:40.291 --> 11:41.542
You're with me
on this, right, Ger?

11:42.875 --> 11:44.166
For sure.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.959
He's a crier.

11:50.291 --> 11:51.875
Thanks for cleaning up,

11:51.959 --> 11:54.125
by which I mean
handing me one glass,

11:54.208 --> 11:56.125
and then looking
through my stuff.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.667
You're a therapist
for other people?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.917
Do they know what the tattoo
on your hip says?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.208
Oh, go away.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.834
All right, fine,
but before I do,

12:02.917 --> 12:05.333
admit that I was better at this
than you thought I'd be.

12:05.417 --> 12:08.250
If you think you deserve
a trophy after one day,

12:08.333 --> 12:10.917
you have no idea
what it means to be a parent.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Damn it! Stop making me say
lame things like that.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.709
I'm cool.
I watch<i> Portlandia. </i>

12:15.792 --> 12:18.875
I almost went to Coachella last
year until I decided not to.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.917
Hey, it's not my fault
that I just met Gerald today.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.083
And by the way, that's the name
you went with? Gerald?

12:24.166 --> 12:26.625
Okay. I'm going to bed.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.834
And I don't know
how to say this nicely,

12:28.917 --> 12:30.875
but get out of my house.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.709
And thank you.

12:35.792 --> 12:37.542
For spending time with Gerald.

12:37.625 --> 12:40.583
Whatever your motivation was,
it... it meant a lot to him.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.709
Now get out.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.166
Ian, the Lees are
coming in at 9:00,

13:06.250 --> 13:08.458
so open a bottle
of Dominus at 8:00.
Yes, sir.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.625
Cindy, it's pronounced
"carpaccio," not "crapachino."

13:10.709 --> 13:13.000
(muffled yelling)

13:13.083 --> 13:14.208
(staff laughing, chattering)

13:14.291 --> 13:15.208
Hi.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.291
Hey. Hi.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.208
I just came by to tell
you that Vanessa and I

13:19.291 --> 13:21.000
are hanging out tonight,
which is exciting.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.291
Attaboy.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.959
And, um, I know
it's last minute,

13:24.041 --> 13:25.291
but could you
watch Edie for me?

13:25.375 --> 13:27.917
Really? You trust me enough
to do that?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.375
Well, I've literally
tried everyone I know.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.583
But, also, I trust you.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.125
It'll be really easy.

13:33.208 --> 13:34.500
She'll be asleep the whole time.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.375
You won't have
to do anything. Please?

13:37.375 --> 13:38.291
I'd love to.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.792
Thanks.
Yeah. All right.

13:39.875 --> 13:41.583
Okay. Great.
Knock 'em dead.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.458
And change
your clothes.
Okay.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.000
(crying)

13:47.083 --> 13:48.291
You're a wolf.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.291
Do you want this?

13:49.375 --> 13:50.208
Want the bottle?
(crying)

13:50.291 --> 13:52.375
(crying)

13:53.375 --> 13:54.875
What word is this?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.917
"C" and an "A."

13:57.000 --> 13:58.500
(speaking gibberish)

13:58.583 --> 14:00.375
(laughing):
You are cute.

14:00.458 --> 14:02.208
You know, you're cuter
than other babies.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.500
You know why?

14:03.583 --> 14:05.000
'Cause you have my dimple.

14:05.083 --> 14:07.375
(speaking gibberish)

14:07.458 --> 14:10.125
but on him, it looks
like a pock mark. Yeah.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.458
Can you give me a kiss?

14:17.458 --> 14:19.166
(laughs)

14:19.250 --> 14:21.083
Did you just kiss me?

14:21.166 --> 14:23.208
(phone ringing)

14:23.291 --> 14:24.959
Hold on one second.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.291
Hey, bro, Deion Sanders is here.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.291
He showed?

14:28.375 --> 14:29.291
He brought everyone.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.917
The whole entourage is here.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.291
Word is Lil Wayne and Don
Rickles are gonna be here, too.

14:33.375 --> 14:34.375
No one's ever said
that sentence before.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.875
Dude, you've got
to get over here.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.291
You know Annelise
is no good with humans.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.959
I can't. I'm babysitting.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.500
Figure something out!
It's happening now!

14:42.834 --> 14:45.166
Deion Sanders, Jimmy Martino.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.834
Happy birthday, my friend.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.041
Jimmy! I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.458
Oh, are you kidding?
Who's more important

14:50.542 --> 14:51.458
than Day Time?

14:51.542 --> 14:52.917
Prime Time.

14:55.917 --> 14:58.250
Oh, hell no.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.583
(fussing)

15:01.959 --> 15:02.959
(lively jazz playing)

15:03.041 --> 15:05.041
(group of diners laughing)

15:05.125 --> 15:07.166
You're so funny
and good-looking.

15:07.250 --> 15:08.500
You brought
the baby here?

15:08.583 --> 15:10.709
Shh. Excuse me, Deion.

15:10.792 --> 15:13.125
I had to.
This is too important.

15:13.208 --> 15:14.542
We used to be the
cool new place.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.250
We used to be Bistro 6.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.125
I used to be Bistro 6.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.750
We were here.
Now we're here.

15:20.834 --> 15:23.375
You carry around an old photo
of yourself?
You don't?

15:23.458 --> 15:24.792
No.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.333
One-- keep the baby alive.

15:26.417 --> 15:27.750
Two-- get a picture
of me and Sanders

15:27.834 --> 15:29.542
that we can vomit all
over the Internet, okay?

15:29.625 --> 15:32.208
Ready? On three.
Get therapy.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.542
Three.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.709
Deion, I was wondering
if you and I could get
a picture together.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.375
Give me a minute.
Let me check out the menu.

15:38.458 --> 15:41.917
(baby crying)

15:42.000 --> 15:43.083
(Jimmy groans)

15:43.166 --> 15:44.542
<i>Damn it!</i>

15:44.625 --> 15:46.667
I'll be right back.

15:46.750 --> 15:50.625
Sleep tight, Squid.
Sleep tight, Whale.

15:50.709 --> 15:53.291
Don Rickles showed, too.
Here, take a picture.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.542
Hello, Mr. Rickles.

15:54.625 --> 15:57.208
Deion, how about a big shot?
Ready?

15:57.291 --> 15:59.625
Not of yourself. Of us.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.625
Oh.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.083
Ready? Smi...

16:02.166 --> 16:03.625
Ugh.

16:03.709 --> 16:05.709
Hold on one second, sir.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.166
How long... how long
have you had this problem?

16:08.250 --> 16:09.959
(laughing)

16:10.041 --> 16:11.583
It's almost like
she hasn't slept

16:11.667 --> 16:13.125
in a restaurant kitchen before.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.333
I'm gonna play
a baby CD.

16:15.417 --> 16:17.166
How does this thing
play in here?

16:17.250 --> 16:18.583
(lullaby plays
over P.A. system)

16:18.667 --> 16:20.667
What is that?

16:20.750 --> 16:23.625
Round and round.
Round and... Here.

16:23.709 --> 16:25.083
(exaggerated snoring)

16:25.166 --> 16:27.458
Go like this.
(muttering)

16:28.709 --> 16:30.750
Good.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.375
Now Lil Wayne
just showed up.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.667
It's getting weirder.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.625
Get the picture.
Hi, guys.

16:35.709 --> 16:36.917
Let me get a quick picture
of the four of us.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.625
This'll be great. Go.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.166
(Edie squeals, laughs)

16:41.375 --> 16:42.709
(Edie laughing)

16:42.792 --> 16:44.125
I'll be right back. Hi!

16:44.208 --> 16:45.125
Oh, come... oh,
come here, you little...

16:45.208 --> 16:46.583
Come, come... oh!

16:46.667 --> 16:48.542
(Edie crying)

16:48.625 --> 16:50.709
You don't want
one of those, do you?

16:50.792 --> 16:53.583
(Edie crying)

16:53.667 --> 16:55.375
Oh... yes...
(cooing gently)

16:55.458 --> 16:57.125
Let me see.

16:57.208 --> 16:58.959
Look at me.
You feel a little warm.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.667
(crying)

17:02.166 --> 17:04.333
Why isn't anyone picking up?

17:04.417 --> 17:06.333
a meat thermometer
in her butt?
That's the meat
thermometer?

17:06.417 --> 17:07.709
People are meat.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.458
(Edie cries)

17:09.542 --> 17:11.500
(beep)

17:11.583 --> 17:13.709
103. That's normal, right?

17:13.792 --> 17:15.041
Dude, that's
actually really high.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.458
Oh, no. Oh, no.

17:17.542 --> 17:19.458
Okay, come here, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on.

17:19.542 --> 17:20.834
ANNELISE:
Where are you going?

17:20.917 --> 17:23.166
Hospital!
And wash that thermometer!

17:23.250 --> 17:24.792
Throw away that
thermometer.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.333
But this thing cost,
like, 20 bucks.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.792
(Edie crying)

17:31.875 --> 17:33.250
Move it! Excuse me.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.834
Where's the valet?!

17:34.917 --> 17:36.625
Where's Rico? Where's...?

17:36.709 --> 17:38.333
Forget it.

17:38.417 --> 17:39.875
(horns honking)

17:42.333 --> 17:45.667
Jimmy?
Oh, hey... you.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.333
It's okay.

17:47.417 --> 17:49.709
It's okay, Edie.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.166
Lindsay.
Her name was Lindsay.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.208
Quick, I need a doctor.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.417
She's burning up.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.917
No, no, I'm not
her father. I'm...

18:03.000 --> 18:04.542
I'm her grandfather.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.125
Okay, let me take her
for some tests.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.208
Go fill out a form
and have a seat.

18:08.291 --> 18:10.625
No, I need to stay
with her.
I'm sorry.
You have to wait here.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.625
You look a little young
for a doctor.

18:12.709 --> 18:13.875
Could you get someone older?

18:13.959 --> 18:15.583
Asian, if you got it.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.083
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Morris, dial 118, please.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.875
(siren wails in distance)

18:19.959 --> 18:22.959
I screwed up, Sara,
just like you knew I would.

18:23.041 --> 18:24.959
I'm 50 freaking years old,

18:25.041 --> 18:27.875
and I'm still the same guy you
didn't trust 25 years ago.

18:27.959 --> 18:30.291
I wanted to be good at this,
I really did, but...

18:30.375 --> 18:33.000
I just don't know how.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.625
She's gonna be fine.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.166
(sighs)

18:39.250 --> 18:40.875
When Gerald was a baby,

18:40.959 --> 18:43.208
I was buckling him
into his car seat,

18:43.291 --> 18:45.125
and it was a really hot day.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.041
I got distracted,
and the buckle burned him.

18:49.417 --> 18:50.959
He was four months old.

18:51.041 --> 18:53.959
I swear, he looked right at me
and gave me the finger.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.500
(laughs)

18:55.583 --> 18:58.333
That was our first trip
to the E.R.

18:58.417 --> 19:01.875
Parenthood is pretty much
an endless string of moments

19:01.959 --> 19:04.041
where you think
you've killed your kid.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.875
I hate this feeling.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.667
I mean, suddenly, I'm not
just worrying about myself.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.875
I'm actually worrying
about someone I care about.

19:11.959 --> 19:13.125
(laughs)

19:13.208 --> 19:15.959
Ugh.
What?

19:16.041 --> 19:19.959
For, like, two seconds there,
you reminded me why I dated you.

19:20.041 --> 19:22.250
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.000
You know, we still...

19:27.083 --> 19:29.125
That is never
gonna happen.
All right.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.125
Want some coffee?
Yes.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.458
She's fine. It's just a fever,
and it's already going down.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.000
I'm gonna go get her ready,

19:40.083 --> 19:41.208
so just wait here.

19:41.291 --> 19:42.291
Thank you.

19:43.542 --> 19:44.792
What happened?
What did I miss?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.041
She needs a liver transplant,

19:46.125 --> 19:47.333
and you're the only match.

19:47.417 --> 19:50.125
All right. I'm in.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.875
a couple of things first.
Do you dye your hair?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.375
It's not dye.
It's colorizing cream.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.583
Have you had Botox?

19:56.667 --> 19:58.875
Then where?
(laughter)

19:58.959 --> 20:02.041
Ah. Good one.

20:02.125 --> 20:03.166
DOCTOR:
Okay, guys,

20:03.250 --> 20:04.458
she's ready. Come on back.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.083
Well, at least Edie's okay.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.917
You know, don't even talk to me,
you irresponsible ass.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.417
Tonight just confirmed
everything

20:13.500 --> 20:15.834
my mom ever said about you.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.417
How'd the date go?

20:17.500 --> 20:19.375
Good. She liked my clothes.
