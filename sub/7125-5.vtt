WEBVTT

00:07.458 --> 00:08.458
Drive.

00:17.583 --> 00:22.250
Holy moly! OK.
You've done something.
We can work it out.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.083
We just need to get to town
before the store closes.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.000
[gasps]
We're robbing a store?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.166
Can we just go?

00:28.166 --> 00:30.291
Right, right, right.
No questions.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.250
I'm just the wheel man.

00:32.250 --> 00:36.834
One request though.
If there's going to be
some kind of spree...

00:36.834 --> 00:38.291
It's nothing like that.

00:38.291 --> 00:43.000
The only crime is me
stupidly wanting
a relationship with my father.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.667
[car rumbles]

00:46.667 --> 00:48.583
My car shakes
if I go above 50,

00:48.583 --> 00:50.792
so we have
some time together,

00:50.792 --> 00:54.709
if you'd like to, you know,
to share or...

00:54.709 --> 00:56.542
[mumbles]

00:56.542 --> 01:00.000
Well, it all started
with ice cream.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.583
It usually does.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.291
[Samantha]
The thing about amnesia

01:05.291 --> 01:07.417
is that you learn
something new everyday.

01:07.417 --> 01:11.083
Last week, I learned
it's a bad idea to sit behind
me on a roller coaster.

01:11.083 --> 01:14.709
So anyway, a couple of days
ago, I was trying to learn
my favorite ice cream.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.625
[pop music]

01:16.625 --> 01:20.875
Mm-mm! Mint chocolate chip
skyrockets to number one.
[grunts]

01:20.875 --> 01:23.875
I can always tell
when hunting season's
about to start.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.542
We've been here an hour
and you're still smiling.

01:26.542 --> 01:30.667
I've never been so bored,
but who cares?
Tomorrow I am a man.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.333
Samantha.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.166
Honey,
have you made a decision?

01:35.166 --> 01:37.834
Yes. There is
no bad ice cream.

01:37.834 --> 01:39.875
Oh, good. OK.
Well, then, so we can...

01:39.875 --> 01:42.083
Wait a minute, wait.
What is frozen yogurt?

01:42.083 --> 01:44.125
- [Regina] Oh, Lord.
- No, no, I wanna...

01:44.125 --> 01:46.208
...I wanna try the...

01:46.208 --> 01:48.083
[♪ Go-Go's: We Got The Beat ]

01:48.083 --> 01:51.333
...the... excuse me...
[snorts]

01:51.333 --> 01:54.917
...the vanilla bean
swirl, uh...

01:54.917 --> 01:58.166
...because I think
I might like that.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.542
Because... [sobbing]

02:01.542 --> 02:04.083
What is this song?

02:04.083 --> 02:08.083
- This song is so sad!
- [boy] Mommy,
she's scaring me.

02:08.083 --> 02:10.208
I knew it was a mistake
bringing her here.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.542
It always ended
in tears.

02:12.542 --> 02:15.291
I'm sorry.
She's just over-tired.

02:15.291 --> 02:18.750
- No, I'm not.
I want more ice cream.
- Come on.

02:21.083 --> 02:24.083
So I didn't even stop
crying until we were
halfway home.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.709
What was the song?

02:25.709 --> 02:27.667
I didn't catch the words,
but it was like...

02:27.667 --> 02:30.083
[humming]

02:30.083 --> 02:33.083
Oh, I love that song.
It's by Mm-Mm
and the Mm-Mm's.

02:33.083 --> 02:36.333
This is a very
powerful memory for me
and I need it.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.125
Oh, God. What is it
connected to?
Is it a past love?

02:39.125 --> 02:42.083
- Or us? Was it our song?
- We didn't have a song.

02:42.083 --> 02:45.834
Every time I suggested one
you laughed and asked
if I was on my period.

02:45.834 --> 02:50.125
Bad girlfriend. I keep
hoping you were the only guy
that I treated terribly.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.125
You! No!

02:53.166 --> 02:55.583
No, no, no, no, no, no!

02:55.583 --> 02:57.542
I'm thinking
there were others.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.417
- Do you mind if I... ?
- No, please.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.083
Wait!

03:01.083 --> 03:03.583
A thousand feet, Samantha!
I have it in writing!

03:03.583 --> 03:06.083
Restraining order.
Why didn't I
think of that?

03:06.083 --> 03:08.917
Hey, guy!
Guy, stop! Stop!

03:11.000 --> 03:14.083
- Ah!
- [grunting]

03:14.083 --> 03:15.291
Oh!

03:16.083 --> 03:18.083
[man] Buddy,
are you OK?

03:20.709 --> 03:22.375
Well,
that was interesting.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.083
I know.
I can really throw.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.125
Restraining orders
are just so unfair.

03:30.125 --> 03:34.750
I mean, sometimes a love
is just too big to be
fenced in by laws.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.333
Well, yeah. And they're
totally unenforceable.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.000
I mean, how do you
eyeball a thousand feet?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Fourteen
telephone poles.

03:44.625 --> 03:48.083
I can't believe you,
Andrea. How could you not
tell me about this?

03:48.083 --> 03:51.083
You call me at midnight
to tell me to get
my eyebrows waxed,

03:51.083 --> 03:53.500
but my restraining order
just slips your mind?

03:53.500 --> 03:57.208
Forgetting things
we shouldn't remember is
why God invented amnesia.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.917
And tequila.

03:58.917 --> 04:01.083
- Why do you have my file?
- I represented you.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.792
- Thank you.
- Not for free.

04:02.792 --> 04:04.166
So how was I obsessed?

04:04.166 --> 04:06.917
Did I leave too many
messages or something?

04:06.917 --> 04:09.917
Or write him poems?
I kidnapped his dog?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.166
Ah! "Waited for him
in his tanning bed.

04:12.166 --> 04:14.208
Took his clothes
from a dressing room

04:14.208 --> 04:16.875
and made him come out
in his underwear
and talk to me."

04:16.875 --> 04:19.458
- [giggles]
That one's kind of cool.
- I like that one.

04:19.458 --> 04:23.083
Yeah, but now there's
this restraining order
against me, on Old Me.

04:23.083 --> 04:26.125
I'm not that person anymore.
I'm 100 percent less stalky.

04:26.125 --> 04:29.041
Well, good.
Then it will be easy
not to violate it.

04:29.041 --> 04:32.583
But what about him?
I mean, this poor guy is
like a wreck because of me.

04:32.583 --> 04:35.959
He should know that
he doesn't have to keep
looking over his shoulder.

04:35.959 --> 04:37.500
I should call him.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.250
No. You get something
in your teeth

04:39.250 --> 04:41.083
and you shake it
until it's dead.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.667
Yeah,
but maybe not anymore.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.709
OK. No, you're right.
You're right.

04:47.917 --> 04:50.375
- Catch.
- Oh! Ooh!

04:50.375 --> 04:54.291
"Nathan Burke,
312-555-0196".

04:55.291 --> 04:57.125
Good, go ahead, call him.

04:57.125 --> 05:01.083
It's not like a guy
who's being stalked wouldn't
change his phone number.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.458
Oh, that's a good point.

05:03.458 --> 05:04.583
Nathan?

05:04.583 --> 05:06.083
[Nathan] Go away!

05:06.083 --> 05:08.959
I just want to talk.
Open the door.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.667
[Nathan]
Don't think so. Uh-Uh.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.542
I'm not going to do
anything, all right.

05:12.542 --> 05:16.500
I just came here to tell you
that you don't have
to worry about me,

05:16.500 --> 05:19.000
you know... coming here.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.083
I'm very sorry for what
I put you through,

05:21.083 --> 05:24.834
but trust me,
you do not need
a restraining order.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.083
- [Nathan] OK, then.
- Really?

05:27.083 --> 05:29.208
[Nathan] Sure. People
can change, I guess.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.375
Thanks for telling me,
that's a big relief.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.500
Oh, for me, too.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.083
I am so glad you think
that people can change

05:36.083 --> 05:39.542
because, you know,
I struggle with that
question every day myself.

05:39.542 --> 05:42.959
You know? Nathan?

05:44.417 --> 05:45.959
Nathan?

05:45.959 --> 05:48.083
You tried. If he
doesn't want to hear it,

05:48.083 --> 05:50.542
there's nothing
you can do about it.

05:50.542 --> 05:51.875
One would think.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.208
[car alarm beeps]

05:59.083 --> 06:01.333
- That was kind of rude.
- [screams]

06:01.333 --> 06:03.875
What are you...?
How did you break
into my car?

06:03.875 --> 06:07.083
I know, right?
That's another skill
I didn't know I had.

06:07.083 --> 06:11.333
Not driving. Saw it on
Oprah's Survival Special,
never go to a second location.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.750
Look, I just want to talk
to you. Why are you
making this so hard?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.750
I'm going to reach
for my phone.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.125
I want
to have a neighbor
check on my dog.

06:19.125 --> 06:22.208
Listen to me.
I don't know you.
All right?

06:22.208 --> 06:24.041
I have retrograde amnesia.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.291
Amnesia doesn't exist.

06:26.291 --> 06:29.083
It's just a cheap and lazy
storytelling device.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.458
[Samantha] No, it's real.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.250
I was hit by a car and was
unconscious for eight days.

06:33.250 --> 06:36.083
So I have no memories,
including of you and me.

06:36.083 --> 06:40.083
So there's no reason
to stalk you. See? There's
nothing to be afraid of.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.750
So how did you find me?

06:41.750 --> 06:46.291
I stole your file.
But, you know what, let's
stay on track, all right?

06:46.291 --> 06:50.083
What I wanted to say
is that after today,
you will never see me again.

06:50.083 --> 06:51.333
I promise.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.542
Really?

06:52.542 --> 06:54.250
Yes.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.083
Well, you do seem different.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.834
I am.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.125
OK.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.125
Oh, God. Thank God.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.583
I know I'm making such
a big deal about this,

07:03.583 --> 07:06.083
but I just wanted you
to know that I am not crazy.

07:06.083 --> 07:10.000
All right. I'm not
that person anymore.
I am a very rational...

07:10.000 --> 07:11.333
[♪ Go-Go's: We Got The Beat ]

07:11.333 --> 07:13.333
Oh, now you see,

07:13.333 --> 07:18.291
[stammers] it's just
all those old memories
have been erased

07:18.291 --> 07:22.959
[sobbing] and I'm just...
I'm just trying to turn
over a new... Damn it!

07:23.959 --> 07:26.125
I'm not crying
about you, OK?

07:26.125 --> 07:29.500
It's about...
I don't even know
what it's about.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.166
I have to go.
Oh, God. [sobs]

07:33.959 --> 07:35.625
That song!

07:37.083 --> 07:39.041
Well,
I'm a little hurt.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.959
You like this boy enough
to stalk him and this is
the first I hear of him?

07:42.959 --> 07:44.125
OK, I don't like him.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.125
Why are you chasing
after this Nathan person

07:46.125 --> 07:48.125
when you're already
dating Todd?

07:48.125 --> 07:52.041
First of all, I'm not dating
Todd and second of all,
I'm not chasing him,

07:52.041 --> 07:56.083
I just tracked him down
to tell him that
I'm not stalking him.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.500
I'm never getting
grandkids, am I?

08:02.542 --> 08:05.625
God, this is
the weirdest day ever.

08:05.625 --> 08:09.250
And I say that knowing
that I have had some
very weird days.

08:09.250 --> 08:13.083
Tomorrow's an early day.
Gets earlier and earlier
every deer season.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.208
All I wanted to do
was just tell the guy

08:15.208 --> 08:18.583
that he didn't have
to worry about me
anymore, but he ran away.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.333
Used to be, you could
walk right out here,

08:21.333 --> 08:23.458
find anything
you wanted to hunt.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.875
Now it's an hour drive
to Frederick's Lake.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.125
I just couldn't let it go.

08:27.125 --> 08:31.083
It's like I couldn't stand
not being paid attention to.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.166
God, I wonder
where that comes from?

08:33.166 --> 08:35.375
You know I got
a great deer stand though.

08:35.375 --> 08:38.667
You got to get there early,
so the cheeseheads
don't grab it.

08:38.667 --> 08:42.417
And the way that I broke
down crying again. Maybe
he should be worried.

08:42.417 --> 08:46.208
Maybe I should be worried.
It's like I never know
when Old Sam's craziness

08:46.208 --> 08:48.000
is just
going to bubble up.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.083
It's just...
God, it's scary.

08:51.083 --> 08:54.417
Now that
is a clean rifle.

08:54.417 --> 08:58.083
Thanks for listening,
Dad. I do feel better.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.417
All right.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.542
You broke into his car?

09:03.542 --> 09:05.333
He snuck out
of his apartment.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.166
- [Dena] Wait a minute!
- What?

09:07.166 --> 09:10.125
You and Andrea
went out for drinks
without me?

09:10.125 --> 09:13.875
You were at swing dancing
class. Now can I just
tell the story?

09:14.917 --> 09:16.291
[sighs]

09:16.291 --> 09:18.166
- [dance music]
- You broke into his car?

09:18.166 --> 09:19.917
He snuck out
of his apartment.

09:19.917 --> 09:21.792
It's called
a restraining order.

09:21.792 --> 09:24.083
Not a restraining tip.
Not restraining advice.

09:24.083 --> 09:27.125
I know. But I had
this compulsion
to be heard. You know?

09:27.125 --> 09:31.333
To say, "Hey, you!
Don't ignore me,
I am here!"

09:31.333 --> 09:33.834
- Someone has daddy issues.
- Who?

09:35.083 --> 09:38.291
Oh, me?
No. What do you mean?

09:38.291 --> 09:41.500
You didn't get enough
of Daddy's love as a child.

09:41.500 --> 09:45.834
I get plenty of attention
from my dad. I mean,
just tonight we were...

09:45.834 --> 09:49.375
Just tonight he didn't
listen to me at all.

09:49.375 --> 09:52.125
This is not good.
I don't want
to have daddy issues.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.583
Yes, you do.

09:53.583 --> 09:56.083
I would like to have
a good relationship
with my father.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.083
No, you don't.
Now you listen to me.

09:58.083 --> 10:03.000
There are a lot of
pretty girls. We're hot.
Why? We're damaged.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.083
You wanting more attention
than you can ever possibly
get, that is your drive.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.750
It is why you're successful.
Don't ever, ever fix
your daddy issues.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.166
Otherwise, you'll just be
some woman, on a couch

10:13.166 --> 10:17.125
sitting there, watching TV
next to your husband
eating ice cream sandwiches.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.959
- I want that.
- [whispers] No.

10:18.959 --> 10:20.208
Where can I get a gun?

10:20.208 --> 10:21.750
Almost anywhere. Why?

10:21.750 --> 10:23.542
Because someone's
going hunting.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.458
Right now? OK.

10:29.750 --> 10:34.375
Speed it up, old man!
I'm driving a piece of
crap! What's your excuse?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.208
I'm going to put this
in the back

10:37.208 --> 10:39.917
'cause it's getting
in the way up here.

10:41.542 --> 10:43.083
[sighs]

10:47.125 --> 10:49.458
Coffee?

10:49.458 --> 10:53.500
What's going on?
Did you just get home from
some club or something?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.959
No. I'm going hunting.

10:54.959 --> 10:56.875
- What do you mean?
- With you.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.083
No. No. Sorry. No.

10:59.083 --> 11:02.041
Yes. Why not?

11:02.041 --> 11:04.375
Because I hunt alone.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.291
Or with Jack Bellamy
when he doesn't
have phlebitis.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.125
But I want us
to do stuff together,
just you and me.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.291
[exhales] We do.

11:12.291 --> 11:14.250
We had ice cream
together.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.458
Last night
we cleaned my rifle.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.166
I mean,
we'll do some stuff
together later on.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.792
Why don't you just
go back to bed?

11:21.792 --> 11:22.959
OK.

11:24.166 --> 11:28.709
[yawning] It is
sort of early for me.
Good night, Dad.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.083
[up-tempo music]

11:35.375 --> 11:38.083
[garage door rumbling]

11:44.000 --> 11:45.250
[engine revs]

11:54.125 --> 11:55.125
Damn it.

11:55.125 --> 11:56.792
Yes, you have
to take me.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.417
You've never been
hunting.

11:58.417 --> 12:01.625
You'll shoot your
leg off, then good luck
getting married.

12:01.625 --> 12:05.083
No, but I've been practicing.
And I bought this
pretty new rifle.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.875
I went to the gun range,
and then last night
I watched The Deer Hunter

12:08.875 --> 12:11.041
which really wasn't
helpful at all.

12:11.041 --> 12:14.625
Have you heard of Vietnam?
I mean, do people know
about that?

12:14.625 --> 12:17.041
I don't see this
ending well.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.917
You and your father
have a good relationship.

12:19.917 --> 12:22.709
Why screw it up
by spending time together?

12:22.709 --> 12:27.125
We do not have a good
relationship. We don't talk.
Not about anything.

12:27.125 --> 12:30.625
And I just think that
if I can do something
with him that he loves

12:30.625 --> 12:32.583
that he and I
can finally connect.

12:32.583 --> 12:36.583
If you want to connect
with someone, I'm right
here. Connect with me.

12:36.583 --> 12:39.125
No, you and I,
we connect plenty,
thank you.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.083
There is not an amnesia
strong enough

12:41.083 --> 12:44.083
to erase the memory
of last week's
tai chi exercises.

12:44.083 --> 12:48.000
I told you, I thought
it was supposed
to be done naked.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.083
How long do I have
to keep apologizing?

12:50.083 --> 12:53.500
Look, Frederick's Lake
is a whole hour away.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.083
You can talk about
whatever you want.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.625
You can even finish
telling me

12:57.625 --> 13:00.625
about that really,
really interesting dream

13:00.625 --> 13:03.125
about you
and Samuel L. Jackson.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.041
- Frederick's Lake?
- Uh-huh.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.083
- That's near
the outlet mall.
- Mm.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.834
You think
they have purses?

13:11.041 --> 13:13.959
Oh, you are so bad.
I'll get dressed.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.458
[exhales] Thank you.

13:18.709 --> 13:21.125
[Samantha] All right,
it's not a deer, people!

13:21.125 --> 13:24.166
It's just a human!
It's a human being
coming through. Hey!

13:24.166 --> 13:26.375
What the hell
are you doing here?

13:26.375 --> 13:30.333
I've got to hunt. I just
feel alive when I'm hunting.
I can't explain it.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.333
You can't take no
for an answer.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.083
So I've heard.
[chuckles]

13:35.333 --> 13:37.083
[sighs]

13:37.083 --> 13:39.083
- OK, you want to hunt?
- Uh-huh.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.083
- Let's hunt.
- Yay!

13:43.792 --> 13:46.417
[clicking]

13:54.083 --> 13:55.125
[birds chirping]

14:10.083 --> 14:11.917
[Samantha] Hmm?

14:12.917 --> 14:14.500
So, now what?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.083
Now we wait.

14:16.083 --> 14:17.625
All right.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.083
- So, Dad...
- Shh!

14:21.083 --> 14:23.083
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.500
Wait a minute.
Why, shh?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.834
It means, no talking.
We're hunting.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.125
- But I just...
- Shh!

14:30.125 --> 14:32.083
I will not, shh!
The only reason

14:32.083 --> 14:34.083
that I came hunting is
so that we could talk.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.875
That's why I go hunting,
because nobody talks!

14:36.875 --> 14:38.792
Well, we wouldn't have
to talk right now

14:38.792 --> 14:41.583
if you had shared
a single feeling
with me my entire life!

14:41.583 --> 14:44.500
- [cell phone rings]
- Oh, for the love of Pete.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.250
[sighs]

14:46.250 --> 14:48.375
Mom, I'm in the middle
of something.

14:48.375 --> 14:52.166
I don't know if I wear
a medium, I'd have
to try it on. [sighs]

14:52.166 --> 14:54.500
She wants to know
if you still wear
pleats.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.166
Since when can I have
a say in what I wear?
Hang up!

14:57.166 --> 14:59.083
- [man] Will you two
shut up?
- You shut up!

14:59.083 --> 15:01.500
I gotta go.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.917
- What do you want from me?
- I want a relationship
with you!

15:04.917 --> 15:08.083
I'm not a talker, OK?
That's why I married
your mother.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.083
She does enough talking
for the both of us.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.083
I'm this
high-maintenance mess

15:12.083 --> 15:13.625
who's desperate
for attention

15:13.625 --> 15:16.000
and has to stalk all
of her old boyfriends.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.125
All I want
is some venison stew!

15:18.125 --> 15:20.208
You know what?
I'm done here.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.125
I don't need you,
or your attention,
or anything from any man.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.458
[gunshot]

15:28.709 --> 15:31.083
I do need this.
I need it. OK.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.917
[Samantha] Hunting
was a disaster.

15:38.917 --> 15:41.166
So now my Dad and I
are not only not talking,

15:41.166 --> 15:44.083
we are not talking about
not talking. Nice plan, Sam.

15:44.083 --> 15:47.458
Maybe if they let you
take back the rifle you
could get a fishing boat.

15:47.458 --> 15:51.291
[gasps] Get a guy in
the middle of a lake and
he's going to talk to you,

15:51.291 --> 15:53.458
and listen to the song
you wrote for him.

15:53.458 --> 15:57.166
My dad would jump overboard
with an anchor before
he talks to me again.

15:57.166 --> 16:01.125
God, he is so stubborn,
I just want to kill him.
[gasps]

16:01.125 --> 16:03.250
- Oh, my God.
- Nathan.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.375
- Oh, no.
- Get away!

16:05.375 --> 16:07.583
Help! She's got a gun!

16:07.583 --> 16:10.083
- No, no. It's not for...
- [crowd screaming]

16:10.083 --> 16:11.458
It's for my dad.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.000
- Oh, sorry.

my father's love.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.291
What'd you do?

16:37.291 --> 16:38.291
Broke into a car.

16:38.291 --> 16:41.333
Oh, I can do that!

16:41.333 --> 16:43.333
But I wouldn't.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.041
And I haven't.

16:46.041 --> 16:49.542
- Newly, your ride's here.
- Oh.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.208
[car humming]

17:04.750 --> 17:06.917
I asked Mom to come get me.

17:06.917 --> 17:08.417
I told her I'd do it.

17:09.291 --> 17:11.291

17:14.291 --> 17:17.291
- Radio OK?
- Whatever.

17:31.333 --> 17:33.000
Hey, Sammie, get in.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.458
I called Mom to come.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.250
I said I would.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.333
Just drive before
anyone sees us.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.291
Looks nice.

Oh, my God. They butchered
my bangs. On purpose.

[scoffs] I was the shoo-in
for Homecoming Court,
but now I am hideous.

No one will care
that Abby Kessler
went to third base

17:59.291 --> 18:03.959
with the entire soccer team,
which she didn't,
but I worked hard

18:03.959 --> 18:06.834
so everyone thought
she did so she wouldn't win,
but now she will.

18:06.834 --> 18:10.917
God, this is why I wanted to go
to a good salon in the city.

18:14.709 --> 18:16.208
You want the radio?

18:39.291 --> 18:42.041
I wasn't very easy,
was I?

18:42.041 --> 18:44.291
- What?
- As a teenager.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.333
Well, we got along great
when you were a kid.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.333
You were daddy's
little girl.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.375
But when you got older...

18:52.375 --> 18:54.583
- I know.
- You went insane.

18:54.583 --> 18:55.750
I know.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.125
Completely nuts.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.333
I said I know.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.917
Those are called
feelings, by the way.

19:00.917 --> 19:04.041
Yeah, well,
your mother said
it was normal,

19:04.041 --> 19:08.583
but, um...
I just didn't know
what to say anymore.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.542
Finally, I guess
I stopped trying.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.792
Well,
let's make a deal, OK?

19:18.792 --> 19:22.250
I won't try to make you
someone that you're not.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.583
And you don't
give up on me, OK?

19:26.291 --> 19:28.417
Because I need my daddy.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.208
OK.

19:35.333 --> 19:38.291
- But no more hunting.
- Blecch! God, no.

19:43.875 --> 19:47.291
So I told my dad about
being in jail and he even
asked me questions.

That might have been
our first actual
conversation.

I'm trying to tell you why I
don't need attention from men.

I heard you.
So all the crying was
about a bad haircut?

19:58.250 --> 20:00.291
Obviously, you haven't
had a bad haircut.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.208
Sure,
I just put on a hat.

Do you have kids, Frank?

Do you tell her
you love her?

All the time.

Thanks.

correctly, is high
on your list.

Oh, for Pete's sake.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.792
Yeah, Maddie,
this is Dad.

21:02.792 --> 21:06.291
[Samantha] So like I was
saying, you learn a new
thing every day.

Today I learned that you
never know how one thing
will affect another.

21:09.917 --> 21:13.750
If I hadn't run into Nathan,
I never would've gotten
closer with my dad.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.709
Hmm, I bet Nathan would
find that interesting.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.917
I should call him.
