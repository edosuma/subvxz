00:25.419 --> 00:29.215
Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you!

00:29.298 --> 00:32.134
Thank you for coming. Hello!

00:32.759 --> 00:34.178
Hello.

00:35.096 --> 00:38.391
We are gonna have to
get this shit over with,

00:38.474 --> 00:41.769
'cause I have to pee in,
like, ten minutes.

00:43.354 --> 00:46.274
But thank you, everybody,
so much for coming. Um...

00:46.357 --> 00:50.695
It's a very exciting day for me.
It's been a very exciting year for me.

00:50.778 --> 00:53.489
I turned 33 this year.

00:53.573 --> 00:56.868
Yes! Thank you, five people.

00:56.951 --> 00:59.370
I appreciate that.

00:59.453 --> 01:02.498
Uh, I can tell that I'm getting older,

01:02.582 --> 01:07.795
because, now, when I see
an 18-year-old girl,

01:07.879 --> 01:10.131
my automatic thought...

01:10.673 --> 01:14.177
is "Fuck you."

01:16.012 --> 01:19.765
"Fuck you.
I don't even know you, but fuck you!"

01:21.233 --> 01:23.027
'Cause I'm straight up jealous.

01:23.110 --> 01:27.031
I'm jealous, first and foremost,
of their metabolism.

01:27.114 --> 01:29.909
Because 18-year-old girls,
they could just eat like shit,

01:29.992 --> 01:33.704
and then they take a shit
and have a six-pack, right?

01:33.787 --> 01:37.041
They got that-that beautiful
inner thigh clearance

01:37.124 --> 01:41.003
where they put their feet together
and there's that huge gap here

01:41.086 --> 01:45.508
with the light of potential
just radiating through.

01:51.931 --> 01:55.059
And then, when they go to sleep,
they just go to sleep.

01:55.142 --> 01:57.728
Right? They don't have insomnia yet.

01:57.811 --> 02:01.398
They don't know what it's like
to have to take a Ambien

02:01.482 --> 02:05.986
or download a Meditation Oasis podcast

02:06.070 --> 02:11.283
to calm the chatter of regret
and resentment towards your family

02:11.408 --> 02:14.161
just cluttering your mind.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.549
They have their whole lives
ahead of them.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.419
They don't have HPV yet.

02:22.502 --> 02:26.046
They just go to sleep in peace at night.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.932
Everybody has HPV, OK?

02:36.016 --> 02:38.101
Everybody has it. It's OK.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.562
Come out already. Everybody has it.

02:40.645 --> 02:43.440
If you don't have it yet,
you go and get it.

02:44.423 --> 02:46.066
You go and get it. It's coming.

02:46.885 --> 02:50.722
You don't have HPV yet,
you're a fucking loser, all right?

02:50.806 --> 02:52.432
That's what that says about you.

02:54.059 --> 02:57.187
A lot of men don't know
that they have HPV,

02:57.270 --> 03:00.315
because it's undetectable in men.

03:00.399 --> 03:05.570
It's really fucked up. HPV is a ghost
that lives inside men's bodies

03:05.654 --> 03:08.615
and says, "Boo!" in women's bodies.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.543
My doctor told me that I have
one of two strains of HPV.

03:19.626 --> 03:23.714
Either I have the kind
that's gonna turn into cervical cancer...

03:26.466 --> 03:30.095
...or I have the kind
where my body will heal itself.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.117
Very helpful, this doctor, right?

03:38.194 --> 03:41.156
So, basically, either I'm gonna die...

03:42.115 --> 03:44.951
or you're in the presence
of Wolverine, bitches.

03:47.162 --> 03:48.705
We'll find out.

03:51.374 --> 03:54.169
Um, I can also tell
that I'm getting older,

03:54.252 --> 03:58.923
because my Kindle
is turning into a self-help library.

04:00.258 --> 04:04.929
I'm not interested in books
like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK?

04:05.013 --> 04:09.434
I'm interested in
The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.

04:11.085 --> 04:15.298
Yes. Yes, that's right,
how to declutter my home

04:15.381 --> 04:19.218
to achieve inner peace
and my optimum level of success.

04:20.511 --> 04:24.015
That's what your 30s is all about.
How can I turn this shit around?

04:24.098 --> 04:28.227
I'm a horrible person,
I'm not happy with where I am,

04:28.311 --> 04:31.689
how can I turn this shit around?
Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!

04:32.940 --> 04:34.525
I have a hoarding problem,

04:34.609 --> 04:38.279
which I'm hoping is the center
of all of my other problems.

04:38.362 --> 04:42.883
I'm hoping that if the hoarding
goes away, the HPV will also disappear.

04:45.411 --> 04:50.208
I have a hoarding problem because my mom
is from a third world country

04:50.291 --> 04:53.669
and she taught me that you can
never throw away anything,

04:53.753 --> 04:58.299
because you never know when a dictator's
gonna overtake the country

04:58.382 --> 04:59.926
and snatch all your wealth.

05:00.009 --> 05:03.304
So, you better hold onto
that retainer from the third grade,

05:03.387 --> 05:05.389
'cause it might come in handy as a shovel

05:05.473 --> 05:07.975
when you're busy
stuffing gold up your butt

05:08.059 --> 05:11.187
and running away from the Communists.

05:16.175 --> 05:18.302
The last time I was at home
in San Francisco,

05:18.385 --> 05:20.596
I was trying to help her get rid of shit.

05:20.679 --> 05:25.226
Don't ever do that with your mom. It was
like the worst experience of my life.

05:25.309 --> 05:26.894
It was so emotional.

05:26.977 --> 05:31.315
We were screaming and fighting
and yelling and it all came to a climax

05:31.398 --> 05:33.609
when she refused to let go

05:33.692 --> 05:37.262
of a Texas Instruments TI-82...

05:37.510 --> 05:38.552
manual.

05:44.837 --> 05:47.131
The manual. She don't even know...

05:47.673 --> 05:49.216
where the calculator is.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.135
Those of you under 25

05:51.218 --> 05:53.929
probably don't know
what that calculator is.

05:54.013 --> 05:57.433
It was this calculator
that bamboozled my generation.

05:57.516 --> 06:01.228
We were all required to buy it
when we were in eight grade.

06:01.312 --> 06:03.597
It cost like $200.

06:04.815 --> 06:09.612
And everybody thought it was like
this Judy Jetson's laptop from the future.

06:09.695 --> 06:11.238
All because what?

06:11.322 --> 06:12.572
It could graph.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.579
It was like the Tesla of my time.

06:22.249 --> 06:25.294
And my mom got so emotional
about the manual

06:25.377 --> 06:28.756
and she was like, "You never know
when you might need this."

06:28.839 --> 06:32.134
And I was like, "But... I do know...

06:32.218 --> 06:35.513
that I'm gonna have to
clean all this shit up when you die."

06:37.515 --> 06:41.477
"And I'm not trying to be
a procrastinator anymore.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.647
Because according to Deepak-Oprah,

06:44.730 --> 06:49.527
that's not the way for me to achieve
my optimum level of success."

06:54.732 --> 06:57.026
I grew up a lot this past year.

06:57.109 --> 06:59.820
Uh, this past year I also got married.

06:59.903 --> 07:02.072
Yeah.

07:05.034 --> 07:08.528
To a man who now has HPV.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.816
Very lucky guy.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.069
He gave me something.

07:15.152 --> 07:17.947
I gave him something.

07:18.030 --> 07:21.033
That will also last forever.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.119
No, really. I'm the lucky girl,

07:24.203 --> 07:27.373
because before him,
I dated a lot of losers.

07:27.456 --> 07:30.084
Lots of losers. A lot of skaters.

07:32.378 --> 07:36.548
You wanna be a grown-ass woman,
stop dating skaters.

07:36.632 --> 07:41.262
Stop dating skaters unless you
wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.144
They're sexy on the outside,
malt liquor on the inside.

07:49.228 --> 07:50.437
Horrible.

07:51.563 --> 07:54.066
But my husband, I first met him
at this wedding

07:54.149 --> 07:56.777
and, uh, he's--
he's much better looking than me,

07:56.860 --> 07:58.320
he's way out of my league,

07:58.404 --> 08:02.283
and I saw him and I was like,
"Oh, my God, who is that?"

08:02.366 --> 08:06.495
And the first thing I learned about him
was that, at the time,

08:06.578 --> 08:10.040
he was attending Harvard Business School.

08:10.666 --> 08:14.670
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna trap his ass."

08:20.175 --> 08:22.719
"Going to trap his ass!"

08:22.844 --> 08:25.889
And I trapped his ass initially

08:25.972 --> 08:28.767
by not kissing him until the fifth date,

08:28.850 --> 08:31.853
which is a very unusual move on my part.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.889
But I did it on purpose,

08:33.972 --> 08:35.640
because I knew that he was a catch.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.936
So I was like, "All right, Ali,
you gotta make this dude believe

08:39.019 --> 08:41.438
that your body is a secret garden."

08:47.643 --> 08:49.853
When, really, it's a public park...

08:58.247 --> 09:00.999
...that has hosted many reggae fests...

09:05.212 --> 09:07.839
...and has even accidentally let...

09:10.592 --> 09:13.470
two homeless people inside.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.955
I thought they were hipsters, OK?

09:17.849 --> 09:21.311
That store Urban Outfitters
has made things very confusing...

09:21.812 --> 09:23.438
for my generation.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.440
You homeless or you a hipster?

09:25.983 --> 09:28.569
Is that beard for fashion or for warmth?

09:33.548 --> 09:35.133
It happened to...

09:35.217 --> 09:37.928
It happened in San Francisco,
when I was living there,

09:38.011 --> 09:40.013
and I saw this guy in broad daylight

09:40.097 --> 09:43.141
and we had, like, we had...
We had so much chemistry.

09:43.225 --> 09:45.227
He was like, "Hey, wassup?"

09:45.310 --> 09:47.646
I was like, "Wassup?"

09:47.729 --> 09:49.856
And we--
The next thing I knew,

09:49.940 --> 09:52.526
we were getting busy
in the back of my Volvo.

09:52.609 --> 09:56.571
And then after we were done,
he was like, "Hey, can you drop me off?"

09:56.655 --> 09:59.616
I was like, "Where?"
He was like, "At the park."

10:00.742 --> 10:02.828
And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park

10:02.911 --> 10:06.123
and watched him run into the middle
with all his other homeless friends,

10:06.206 --> 10:10.627
and I was like, "Oh, no!"

10:13.130 --> 10:16.341
"I just fucked a homeless dude!

10:18.593 --> 10:21.012
Again!"

10:26.935 --> 10:29.187
My husband is Asian.

10:29.271 --> 10:31.732
Which a lot of people are shocked by,

10:31.815 --> 10:35.068
because, usually,
Asian-American women who, like,

10:35.152 --> 10:38.113
you know, wear these kinda glasses
and have a lot of opinions,

10:38.196 --> 10:39.614
they like to date white dudes.

10:39.698 --> 10:44.578
You go to any hipster neighborhood
in a major city in America

10:44.661 --> 10:47.414
and that shit
is turning into a Yoko Ono factory.

10:47.497 --> 10:51.543
It's... too much. I don't know
what's wrong with these bitches.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.029
I get it, you know,
because being with a white dude

10:55.113 --> 10:56.197
you feel very...

10:56.281 --> 10:59.325
You feel very picturesque
when you're with a white dude, you know.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.120
You feel like you're
in a Wes Anderson movie or something.

11:02.462 --> 11:07.092
And you know, white dudes, they
teach you about a lot of cool stuff

11:07.175 --> 11:10.762
like voting and recycling,

11:10.845 --> 11:13.640
and disturbing documentaries.

11:13.723 --> 11:15.809
They introduce you
to cool stuff like that

11:15.892 --> 11:20.021
and it's very, you know, it's hot
hookin' up with a white dude.

11:20.105 --> 11:23.316
I mean, nothing makes me feel
more powerful

11:23.400 --> 11:26.778
than when a white dude eats my pussy.
Oh, my God.

11:26.903 --> 11:30.824
I just feel like I'm absorbing
all of that privilege

11:30.907 --> 11:33.702
and all of that entitlement...

11:33.785 --> 11:37.664
...you know, just right there,
through the money hole and just...

11:37.747 --> 11:40.583
And then also,
he's so vulnerable down there.

11:40.667 --> 11:44.087
I'm, like, "I could just crush your head
at any moment, white man!

11:44.170 --> 11:47.924
I could just kill you right now!
Crush those brains!

11:48.007 --> 11:50.593
Colonize the colonizer!" You know?

12:00.729 --> 12:03.690
But I think that for marriage,

12:03.773 --> 12:07.819
it can be nice to be
with somebody of your own race.

12:07.902 --> 12:11.448
The advantage is that
you get to go home...

12:12.031 --> 12:13.566
and be racist together.

12:19.622 --> 12:22.459
You get to say whatever you like!

12:22.542 --> 12:24.794
You don't gotta explain shit.

12:25.253 --> 12:29.299
My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese.

12:29.799 --> 12:33.595
I'm half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese.

12:33.678 --> 12:39.142
And we spend 100 percent of our time
shitting on Korean people.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.686
It's... amazing.

12:44.272 --> 12:47.275
It's what love is built on, you know?

12:52.739 --> 12:55.617
My last boyfriend was Cuban

12:55.700 --> 13:01.039
and his family would shit
on Mexican people all the time.

13:01.838 --> 13:03.382
And I was like, "Hold it.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.587
You guys aren't Mexican?"

13:14.135 --> 13:16.554
Asian-American men are very underrated.

13:16.638 --> 13:19.974
I don't know why people
don't go for them. They're the sexiest.

13:20.058 --> 13:21.768
Asian men are the sexiest.

13:21.851 --> 13:26.523
They got no body hair from the neck down.

13:30.551 --> 13:33.387
It's like making love to a dolphin.

13:34.555 --> 13:38.434
Oh, my God. It's so smooth,
just like a slip and slide.

13:38.517 --> 13:43.189
Just black fish, Tilikum,
all up in my bed every night, you know?

13:44.315 --> 13:45.942
Ooh-wee.

13:46.025 --> 13:50.696
You mess with a Jewish dude
and your body is all fucked up afterwards.

13:50.780 --> 13:53.282
It's all red and inflamed
and you're like,

13:53.366 --> 13:56.269
"I did not ask to be exfoliated today."

13:58.704 --> 14:02.041
"This is the last time I go on J-date,
more like loofah date.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.087
Thanks for the rug burn, Avi."

14:10.925 --> 14:14.512
And then Asian men, no body odor. None.

14:16.138 --> 14:18.724
They just smell like responsibility.

14:22.979 --> 14:25.147
That's where the umami flavor comes from.

14:31.487 --> 14:36.158
I think my husband and I
have a huge unspoken understanding,

14:36.242 --> 14:37.535
uh, between each other,

14:37.618 --> 14:39.829
because he's half-Filipino
and half-Japanese

14:39.912 --> 14:42.081
and I'm half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese.

14:42.164 --> 14:45.703
So, we're both half-fancy Asian...

14:51.557 --> 14:55.227
...and half-jungle Asian.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.520
Yeah!

14:56.604 --> 14:58.147
You guys know the difference.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.066
The fancy Asians are the Chinese,
the Japanese.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.236
They get to do fancy things
like host Olympics.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.989
Jungle Asians host diseases.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.491
It's... It's different.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.661
But he grew up on the East Coast,

15:12.745 --> 15:16.373
going to private school,
playing lacrosse,

15:16.457 --> 15:20.210
uh, you know, learning Latin
and playing chess and rugby.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.881
He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK?

15:23.964 --> 15:27.217
So, he didn't know anything
about Vietnamese people

15:27.301 --> 15:29.261
until he met me.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.096
And on one of our first dates,

15:31.180 --> 15:35.059
he took me to this restaurant
on the west side of Los Angeles

15:35.142 --> 15:37.603
called Pho Show.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.696
He was like, "It's authentic Vietnamese.
I read about it on Yelp!"

15:47.780 --> 15:50.407
I was like, "It's not authentic, OK?"

15:50.491 --> 15:53.118
You can tell, first and foremost,
by the name,

15:53.202 --> 15:55.371
'cause it don't got a number in it.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.336
Second of all,
you can tell by the bathroom.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.754
If it was legit,

16:03.837 --> 16:06.507
the bathroom would double
as a supply closet.

16:09.016 --> 16:13.562
When I pee, I need to see
ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine

16:13.638 --> 16:16.558
and a grandma with glaucoma
napping in the corner.

16:19.569 --> 16:21.613
And the wait staff here is too nice.

16:21.697 --> 16:25.450
We need to leave this restaurant
deaf and emotionally abused.

16:30.372 --> 16:32.416
I grew up going to private school, too.

16:32.499 --> 16:35.544
Him and I are both total, like,
private school Asians.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.796
We both are big hippies, too.

16:37.879 --> 16:40.716
We like to backpack
through Southeast Asia.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.801
We like to do yoga.

16:42.884 --> 16:45.554
We do ayahuasca ceremonies.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.389
We do silent meditation retreats.

16:47.472 --> 16:51.143
That's right, we pay $800
to shut up for a weekend.

16:51.226 --> 16:52.686
We do shit like that.

16:52.769 --> 16:54.980
Uh, we eat gluten-free,

16:55.063 --> 16:58.859
which means we eat all that bread
that tastes like free-range Chewbacca.

17:00.777 --> 17:03.822
We eat that lesbian bread that's like...

17:03.905 --> 17:06.907
...a thousand percent
of your daily fiber...

17:07.617 --> 17:10.037
and 20 percent spoken word poetry.

17:13.498 --> 17:16.835
When you eat it, you queef
a shitty poem about...

17:18.920 --> 17:21.548
...supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.729
And so, it's funny, right,

17:27.811 --> 17:30.523
because he's Asian, too.

17:30.607 --> 17:33.860
But sometimes, all of this
hippy-dippy shit we do...

17:34.361 --> 17:37.739
makes me feel like we are white people

17:37.822 --> 17:40.283
doing an impression of Asian people.

17:42.619 --> 17:45.997
Like, we have these Chinese scrolls
up on the wall...

17:47.338 --> 17:49.715
and neither of us know
what the fuck they mean.

17:53.880 --> 17:58.051
We're like, "Oh, that seems to go
very well with our Buddha piggy bank

17:58.134 --> 18:00.446
from Pier 1 Imports.

18:01.596 --> 18:04.557
That seems to be providing
some good feng shui for the house.

18:08.645 --> 18:13.191
Him and I had been dating for four years

18:13.274 --> 18:18.363
and I-- I just had this sneaking suspicion

18:18.446 --> 18:20.532
that he was gonna propose...

18:22.367 --> 18:23.410
because...

18:24.828 --> 18:27.080
I had been pressuring him to do it.

18:30.667 --> 18:34.587
So, you know, I just had this
wacky women's intuition.

18:35.171 --> 18:38.007
That's how proposals really work, OK?

18:38.091 --> 18:41.344
A woman has to incept the idea
into the man's head.

18:41.428 --> 18:44.222
First passively and then
if he doesn't get the message,

18:44.305 --> 18:46.558
extremely aggressively.

18:46.641 --> 18:50.103
You gotta threaten to leave
without ever actually leaving,

18:50.186 --> 18:52.147
because you know that you're too old

18:52.230 --> 18:55.567
and it's too late to go back out there
and find a new man

18:55.650 --> 18:58.820
and start the whole manipulation cycle
all over again.

19:00.947 --> 19:03.491
So, you're like, "I'm just gonna
stick with this dude,

19:03.575 --> 19:05.702
focus on trapping this dude,

19:05.785 --> 19:11.374
and just nag the shit outta him
until he becomes weak and caves in

19:11.458 --> 19:14.502
and gets fed up and is like,
"Shut the fuck up!

19:15.545 --> 19:17.046
Fine, will you marry me?"

19:18.590 --> 19:21.009
And then afterwards,
the woman is always, like,

19:21.134 --> 19:24.554
"Oh, my God! He proposed!"

19:27.015 --> 19:29.392
"It came outta nowhere.

19:30.059 --> 19:34.272
And look, he got me
the exact ring I wanted.

19:35.106 --> 19:37.400
How did he know?

19:39.194 --> 19:42.989
Maybe he saw it
on my Pinterest page or something...

19:43.865 --> 19:48.119
that I sent to my best friend,
that I told her to send to him every day."

19:51.247 --> 19:54.542
Let me tell you something.
If a man has a Pinterest page...

19:55.126 --> 19:57.879
he's probably Pinterested in men.

20:04.052 --> 20:07.138
We got engaged on a Saturday.

20:07.347 --> 20:10.558
I bought my wedding dress
the following Tuesday...

20:11.392 --> 20:15.438
because I had tried it on in 2012.

20:17.298 --> 20:18.299
I was ready.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.676
I was ripe.

20:20.051 --> 20:21.553
I was rotten.

20:22.137 --> 20:25.724
I need to be made into banana bread.
That's how rotten I was.

20:29.686 --> 20:34.941
People are always very surprised
at how, off-stage, with my husband,

20:35.024 --> 20:37.694
I'm a completely different person.

20:37.777 --> 20:41.698
You-- Like, you would not recognize
my personality at all with him.

20:41.781 --> 20:44.242
With him, I'm very soft,

20:44.325 --> 20:47.495
and, like, very nurturing
and very domestic.

20:47.954 --> 20:50.582
We've been together now for five years,

20:50.665 --> 20:55.837
and for five years, I've packed his lunch
every single day.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.715
Yeah. Yes.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.217
Yes. Yes.

21:01.718 --> 21:05.096
I did that so that he'd become
dependent on me.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.023
'Cause he graduated
from Harvard Business School,

21:15.106 --> 21:17.776
and I don't wanna work anymore.

21:20.653 --> 21:23.406
I don't. I straight up
don't wanna work anymore.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.367
I don't feed him
out of the goodness of my heart.

21:26.451 --> 21:30.079
I do it as an investment
in my financial future.

21:31.664 --> 21:33.374
'Cause I don't wanna work anymore.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.252
I've been reading that book
by Sheryl Sandberg,

21:36.419 --> 21:38.797
she's the C.O.O. of Facebook,

21:38.880 --> 21:42.842
and she wrote that book that got women
all riled up about our careers.

21:42.926 --> 21:46.638
Talking about how we as women
should challenge ourselves

21:46.763 --> 21:49.724
to sit at the table and rise to the top.

21:49.849 --> 21:52.769
And her book is called Lean In.

21:54.854 --> 21:58.900
Well, I don't wanna lean in, OK?

21:58.983 --> 22:01.620
I wanna lie down.

22:06.741 --> 22:08.868
I want to lie the fuck down.

22:09.994 --> 22:14.499
I think feminism is the worst thing
that ever happened to women.

22:15.458 --> 22:18.962
Our job used to be no job.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.341
We had it so good.

22:24.342 --> 22:26.511
We could have done the smart thing,

22:26.594 --> 22:30.139
which would have been
to continue playing dumb

22:30.223 --> 22:31.933
for the next century

22:32.016 --> 22:33.851
and be like, "We're dumb women.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.520
We don't know how to do anything.

22:35.603 --> 22:38.523
So, I guess we better
just stay at home all day

22:38.606 --> 22:40.316
and eat snacks and watch Ellen."

22:43.194 --> 22:46.531
"'Cause we're too stupid
to have any real responsibility."

22:46.956 --> 22:49.458
And then, all these women had to show off

22:49.584 --> 22:52.753
and be like, "We could do it!
We could do anything."

22:52.837 --> 22:54.907
"Bitch, shut up!"

22:56.716 --> 22:59.427
"Don't tell them the secret."

23:02.522 --> 23:04.232
They ruined it for us,

23:04.315 --> 23:07.151
and now we're expected to work.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.849
When I hear the phrase,
"Double-income household,"

23:10.988 --> 23:12.407
I wanna throw up.

23:16.369 --> 23:20.707
A lot of women get very upset with me
about those comments.

23:21.374 --> 23:24.669
And they're like, "But, Ali,
we have so many more options now."

23:25.545 --> 23:27.755
Oh, you don't think
we had a lot of options

23:27.839 --> 23:30.258
when our day was free?

23:33.845 --> 23:36.222
Unscheduled, unsupervised,

23:36.305 --> 23:38.850
and most importantly, sponsored?

23:42.353 --> 23:44.647
Do you know how much shittier food tastes

23:44.731 --> 23:46.441
when you know you have to earn it?

23:54.098 --> 23:56.684
A lot of my friends,
when we walk around together,

23:56.768 --> 23:58.645
they'll get very judgmental

23:58.728 --> 24:01.731
about housewives
that we'll see on the street.

24:01.814 --> 24:04.067
And they'll be like,
"Look at that fucking housewife.

24:04.150 --> 24:05.276
Not doing anything.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.737
Look at that housewife,
just walking around all day,

24:07.820 --> 24:10.448
getting massages in her Lululemon pants."

24:12.700 --> 24:14.961
I'm like, "That bitch is a genius."

24:16.913 --> 24:19.791
"She's not a housewife, she's retired."

24:21.793 --> 24:25.004
I do write for Fresh Off the Boat
on ABC.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.882
Yeah. Which is...

24:27.965 --> 24:29.592
It's a great show.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.761
I love it a lot. I love my co-workers.

24:31.844 --> 24:34.305
It's a great writing staff
and in terms of day jobs,

24:34.389 --> 24:37.183
it's probably one of the best
you could ask for,

24:37.266 --> 24:41.854
but I still gotta work at a office
every day.

24:41.938 --> 24:46.776
Which means I gotta shit in a office
every day.

24:46.859 --> 24:50.571
Housewives, they don't gotta shit
in a office.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.658
Housewives get to shit in their house.

24:54.158 --> 24:55.576
Skin to seat.

24:55.702 --> 24:59.330
They don't gotta use
that horrible toilet paper cover.

24:59.497 --> 25:00.665
They don't gotta...

25:04.085 --> 25:06.838
...ten times a day, every day...

25:08.673 --> 25:11.143
like you're about to eat a sad-ass meal.

25:12.427 --> 25:13.636
They don't gotta do that.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.973
They don't gotta use
that one-ply toilet paper,

25:17.098 --> 25:18.558
that office toilet paper,

25:18.641 --> 25:21.769
that they purposely
make difficult to pull out.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.481
They try to ration me
with their communist toilet paper

25:25.565 --> 25:26.816
that's not even effective.

25:26.899 --> 25:29.777
It basically just dehydrates
your butt hole.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.530
It's basically like wiping your butt
with the desert.

25:36.868 --> 25:40.455
I literally spat on my toilet paper
two days ago,

25:40.538 --> 25:43.791
to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe,
to moisten it,

25:43.875 --> 25:47.420
and then it backfired
'cause my fingers broke through

25:47.503 --> 25:50.590
and digitally stimulated
more doo doo to come out,

25:50.715 --> 25:53.134
and then I had to start all over again.

26:00.183 --> 26:03.060
And you can never finish wiping at work

26:03.144 --> 26:05.062
because you always feel rushed

26:05.146 --> 26:06.230
'cause you're paranoid

26:06.314 --> 26:09.150
that your co-worker's gonna
recognize your shoes

26:09.233 --> 26:10.526
underneath the stall.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.154
And you're like, "Oh, no!
Courtney's listening.

26:13.237 --> 26:15.531
She's waiting. She's timing me."

26:15.656 --> 26:17.992
And then you hurry, hurry, hurry,

26:18.075 --> 26:19.660
and then you never finish wiping

26:19.744 --> 26:22.747
and then your butt hole
feels caked in doo doo all day long.

26:22.830 --> 26:26.292
And then if you dare scratch yourself,
your underwear at the end of the day

26:26.375 --> 26:28.920
looks like it's been run over
by the Goonies.

26:36.886 --> 26:39.764
Housewives, they don't gotta
muffle their shit, too.

26:39.889 --> 26:43.976
They don't gotta worry about the velocity
with which their doo doo comes out.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.895
They don't gotta try to, you know,

26:45.978 --> 26:47.939
squeeze the butt cheeks together

26:48.064 --> 26:52.360
to make sure that the doo doo comes out
at a slow and steady pace,

26:52.443 --> 26:56.614
so that no unpredictable noise
suddenly escapes

26:56.697 --> 26:59.659
and brings you deep, deep shame.

26:59.742 --> 27:03.788
Housewives are free to
just blow ass into the toilet

27:03.871 --> 27:07.458
and let it echo and reverberate
to the ends of their hallways

27:07.542 --> 27:11.295
while watching as much Netflix
on their iPad as they want.

27:12.797 --> 27:16.259
They don't gotta take
these boring, repressed shits.

27:16.342 --> 27:18.511
They can listen to podcasts.

27:21.347 --> 27:24.225
Planet Money.
They can do whatever they want.

27:30.773 --> 27:33.818
You know, it's--
it's very distracting for me

27:33.901 --> 27:35.820
when I hear my co-workers

27:35.903 --> 27:37.947
blow ass into the toilet.

27:38.906 --> 27:40.825
I lose respect for them.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.828
Nothing they say to me anymore

27:43.911 --> 27:45.797
holds any sort of credence.

27:47.582 --> 27:51.043
I heard one of my co-workers
blow ass into the toilet the other day.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.713
This bitch had the nerve
to come up to me and say,

27:53.796 --> 27:56.674
"You need to get to work on time."

27:58.593 --> 28:01.010
I was like, "You need to eat bananas."

28:03.598 --> 28:07.101
"I saw those green ballet flats.
I know that shit was you.

28:07.184 --> 28:09.186
Don't try to tell me
to get my shit together

28:09.270 --> 28:11.772
when I heard you
not have your shit together."

28:15.401 --> 28:18.446
My father-in-law had this huge sit-down

28:18.529 --> 28:20.615
with me and my husband recently.

28:20.698 --> 28:22.158
Um, and he was like, "Hey,

28:22.241 --> 28:25.786
I wanna talk to you guys about money.

28:25.953 --> 28:29.206
You guys need to make a lot more money

28:29.290 --> 28:30.958
if you wanna provide your children

28:31.042 --> 28:35.046
with the same kind of privileged
childhood that you guys had."

28:35.880 --> 28:38.382
I was like,
"Why you telling me this shit?

28:38.466 --> 28:41.260
I should not
be a part of this conversation.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.762
You tell you son that.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.263
Don't your understand

28:44.347 --> 28:47.308
that I trapped your son
for his earning potential?

28:48.100 --> 28:50.519
Why else would I choose
to fuck one person

28:50.603 --> 28:52.146
for the rest of my life?

28:52.688 --> 28:56.275
I chose to marry him
on the promise of early retirement,

28:56.359 --> 28:57.902
and when I said, 'I do,'

28:57.985 --> 28:59.570
what I really meant was,

28:59.654 --> 29:01.197
'Oh, I'm done.'"

29:03.824 --> 29:05.076
I'm done.

29:05.159 --> 29:07.245
I don't wanna work anymore

29:07.328 --> 29:09.080
and I'm not dieting anymore.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.665
Since I got married last year,

29:10.748 --> 29:13.709
I've been eating fried chicken skin
every day since.

29:14.377 --> 29:17.046
That's right.
And just fulfilling my destiny.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.675
Which is to turn into
a circle with eyelashes.

29:22.593 --> 29:23.803
Like Mrs. Pacman, just...

29:26.097 --> 29:27.181
Let's redecorate.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.650
I gave up a lot of myself
when I got married.

29:37.733 --> 29:40.027
I'm a-- I'm a disgusting pervert.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.029
I'm a pervert.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.116
I'm a gross filthy animal.

29:45.199 --> 29:46.367
And I think it's because

29:46.450 --> 29:49.996
I started watching porn
at a very young age.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.832
And what happens
when you start watching porn

29:52.915 --> 29:54.500
at a young age is that...

29:54.583 --> 29:57.795
y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker.

29:57.878 --> 30:01.966
The images you crave
get sicker, and sicker, and sicker,

30:02.049 --> 30:03.050
but it's OK,

30:03.134 --> 30:05.970
because the Internet
will always catch up to you.

30:11.066 --> 30:13.944
I broke up with my last boyfriend

30:14.028 --> 30:17.449
because he refused to put it in the back.

30:18.749 --> 30:21.919
I was like, "Uh, you're a idiot, dude.

30:22.545 --> 30:25.673
Do you realize
that if I went on Craigslist...

30:26.674 --> 30:30.177
and posted
'Tiny Asian female seeking anal...'

30:31.220 --> 30:34.557
the Internet would crash."

30:36.934 --> 30:39.270
"And all the Jewish male heads
in the universe

30:39.353 --> 30:42.148
would simultaneously explode."

30:42.231 --> 30:44.150
They would explode.

30:45.443 --> 30:47.653
A lot of women get really, you know...

30:48.195 --> 30:49.613
freaked out about anal.

30:49.697 --> 30:52.032
And they're like,
"Oh, I don't wanna do that.

30:52.116 --> 30:54.034
I'm scared of-- of the pain."

30:54.118 --> 30:56.078
You ain't scared of the pain.

30:56.162 --> 30:59.165
Women, they wax their eyebrows,
they do all sorts of crazy shit.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.583
You're not scared of the pain.

31:00.666 --> 31:03.919
What you're really scared of
is doo doo on the dick.

31:06.505 --> 31:08.591
You're scared that he's gonna see that

31:08.674 --> 31:10.551
and that's gonna be all of your shame,

31:10.676 --> 31:13.721
your inner evil,
all your secrets and lies.

31:13.804 --> 31:15.848
Sephora can't help you now.

31:19.393 --> 31:20.811
But don't worry,

31:20.895 --> 31:23.647
'cause when he puts it in the butt,
all he's thinking about is,

31:23.731 --> 31:26.442
"I just put it in her butt."

31:27.735 --> 31:30.863
"I gotta go call my mom, my dad,

31:30.988 --> 31:33.491
Dave, my grandma."

31:35.117 --> 31:38.913
You're-- If you're married, you're gonna
have to do anal eventually, OK?

31:38.996 --> 31:41.332
You have to,
because you gotta change it up.

31:41.415 --> 31:44.335
You gotta change it up,
so that you don't cheat on each other.

31:44.418 --> 31:45.711
You gotta keep it interesting.

31:45.794 --> 31:48.172
If you put it in different holes,

31:48.255 --> 31:51.842
maybe you'll feel like
you're fucking different people.

31:53.511 --> 31:56.472
I was very sexually active in my 20s,

31:56.555 --> 31:58.933
and as a result, I'm a little bit...

32:02.520 --> 32:04.605
...stretched out down there, OK?

32:04.730 --> 32:06.690
So, when I finally did anal,

32:06.774 --> 32:10.528
I just felt like
I got a second chance at life, you know?

32:10.611 --> 32:15.199
I was, like, "Oh, my God!
It's like I'm going back in time!"

32:15.282 --> 32:19.370
♪ A whole new world ♪

32:21.247 --> 32:22.957
It was magical.

32:25.209 --> 32:28.629
A big fantasy of mine
before I got married

32:28.712 --> 32:31.799
was to help as many men as possible

32:31.882 --> 32:34.343
discover their prostate.

32:35.177 --> 32:36.387
Yeah, like a conqueror.

32:36.470 --> 32:37.763
I just wanted to...

32:38.639 --> 32:40.808
Now, if you haven't done it before,

32:40.891 --> 32:43.060
ladies, go home and treat yourself.

32:43.143 --> 32:44.395
Do it tonight.

32:44.478 --> 32:47.147
You only live once.
YOLO. Just sneak your--

32:47.231 --> 32:49.733
Just give your man a little--

32:49.817 --> 32:52.152
a little push-push
in the tush-tush.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.405
Just give him a little Atari, you know,

32:54.488 --> 32:58.075
and you'll get a lot of resistance
from the man at first.

32:58.158 --> 33:01.120
You'll get a lot of "No! No! No!

33:01.203 --> 33:03.789
No, please! No, really, I don't-- No!

33:03.872 --> 33:06.709
I don't! I don't! No!"

33:08.794 --> 33:11.338
They get all squirmy wormy because...

33:11.839 --> 33:13.382
they're scared.

33:13.465 --> 33:16.760
They're scared that
if you stick your thumb up there

33:16.844 --> 33:20.055
and succeed, and they like it,

33:20.139 --> 33:23.350
that then, it might mean
that they're gay.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.320
And I like that fear.

33:34.737 --> 33:36.947
That shit turns me on, you know?

33:37.031 --> 33:41.660
Especially when that fear
metamorphosizes into pleasure.

33:41.744 --> 33:45.497
Oh, my God! And you just see
the look in the man's eye

33:45.623 --> 33:47.541
like he's discovered nirvana.

33:49.168 --> 33:51.962
And it's like
you're the first lady to show him

33:52.087 --> 33:54.548
that he had a magical clit
in his butt hole.

33:54.632 --> 33:58.135
And then, you as the woman,
in his eyes, just become

33:58.260 --> 34:01.096
the Lord of the Rim, you know?

34:08.062 --> 34:11.148
My husband is unfortunately
just not as freaky as me.

34:11.231 --> 34:13.817
When-- When I've asked him to spank me,

34:13.900 --> 34:14.902
this is what he does.

34:22.076 --> 34:24.495
"Hey. Hey, are you OK?

34:25.079 --> 34:27.956
Are you all right?
You know I respect you, right?"

34:28.666 --> 34:31.210
I'm, like, "Yes, I know you respect me

34:31.293 --> 34:35.089
and that's why you need to abuse me. OK?"

34:35.172 --> 34:37.966
'Cause it's the most strong-headed,
loud-mouthed women

34:38.050 --> 34:40.594
who like to be abused the most in bed.

34:40.678 --> 34:43.806
Women who are C.E.O.s,
they just wanna be roughed around.

34:43.889 --> 34:46.934
They just want their--

34:47.309 --> 34:49.561
Glasses always means
the woman wants some--

35:03.784 --> 35:07.246
It's because we're so in control
all the time,

35:07.329 --> 35:09.540
that we just wanna experience

35:09.623 --> 35:12.251
some risk and be out of control,
you know?

35:12.376 --> 35:14.336
Like, "I don't wanna die!

35:15.003 --> 35:17.381
Don't kill me! I don't wanna die!"

35:18.048 --> 35:21.009
But I also don't want to be sure
that I'm gonna live.

35:23.470 --> 35:26.140
You know? I just wanna be
out of control for once.

35:26.223 --> 35:29.476
Just-- Just choke me enough
so that I can't talk.

35:30.477 --> 35:32.062
'Cause if I can talk,

35:32.187 --> 35:34.857
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

35:36.233 --> 35:38.402
And I'm tired of being the boss.

35:38.485 --> 35:40.654
I'm the boss all the time,
so, in the bedroom,

35:40.738 --> 35:42.281
you be the boss.

35:43.907 --> 35:45.159
Yes.

35:45.909 --> 35:49.204
Because I'm the real boss.

35:49.288 --> 35:52.082
And I told you so, motherfucker,
so do it.

35:57.921 --> 36:01.133
Sheryl Sandberg,
that woman who wrote Lean In,

36:01.216 --> 36:05.220
has had such a big impact
that now, because of her,

36:05.304 --> 36:09.349
there is a ban on the word "bossy"
in elementary schools,

36:09.433 --> 36:11.602
because according to her,

36:11.685 --> 36:14.480
it's sexist to use the word "bossy,"

36:14.563 --> 36:17.232
because boys are never called bossy.

36:18.108 --> 36:21.111
So, now, instead of saying,
"You're bossy,"

36:21.195 --> 36:25.032
you're supposed to say,
"You have executive leadership skills."

36:27.201 --> 36:29.953
Which is a very roundabout way of saying:

36:30.537 --> 36:31.872
"You're a little cunt."

36:38.212 --> 36:40.130
I'm just waiting for the right moment

36:40.214 --> 36:43.801
to, like, become a housewife,
financially, you know?

36:43.884 --> 36:48.096
I want my husband to get us
to, like, a certain point financially.

36:48.263 --> 36:50.641
I wanna get to the point as a couple

36:50.766 --> 36:54.937
where I can comfortably afford
sliced mango.

36:57.282 --> 36:59.942
Know what I'm talking about?
I'm talking about that Whole Foods mango.

37:00.025 --> 37:02.861
That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango

37:02.986 --> 37:05.447
that was sliced by white people.

37:05.531 --> 37:08.534
That's the kind of income bracket
I'm striving for.

37:09.201 --> 37:10.953
That's when you know you've made it,

37:11.036 --> 37:14.706
when you're eating mango that was sliced
by a dude named Noah.

37:14.790 --> 37:17.042
I want Noah mango...

37:17.125 --> 37:18.669
...Rebecca kiwi,

37:18.752 --> 37:20.379
Danielle pineapple.

37:21.463 --> 37:22.881
You know what else I want?

37:23.006 --> 37:28.303
I wanna be able to take a stroll
on a sidewalk,

37:28.387 --> 37:29.638
see a quarter,

37:29.721 --> 37:31.431
and just keep on walking.

37:34.685 --> 37:35.811
Like a princess.

37:39.356 --> 37:43.068
I have some useful advice for all my
Asian-American brothers and sisters.

37:44.486 --> 37:46.113
Yeah!

37:46.446 --> 37:49.400
Never go paintballing
with a Vietnam veteran.

37:59.117 --> 38:00.827
So, I don't know if you guys can tell,

38:00.910 --> 38:03.414
but I am seven and a half months
pregnant.

38:05.290 --> 38:06.583
Yeah.

38:07.553 --> 38:11.421
It's very rare and unusual

38:11.504 --> 38:14.966
to see a female comic perform pregnant,

38:15.049 --> 38:17.302
because female comics...

38:17.780 --> 38:19.596
don't get pregnant.

38:23.691 --> 38:26.861
Just try to think of one. I dare you.
There's-- None of them.

38:27.362 --> 38:30.365
Once they do get pregnant,
they generally disappear.

38:30.490 --> 38:32.784
That's not the case with male comics.

38:32.867 --> 38:34.244
Once they have a baby,

38:34.369 --> 38:36.913
they'll get up on stage a week afterwards

38:36.996 --> 38:40.291
and they'll be like,
"Guys, I just had this fucking baby.

38:40.417 --> 38:44.212
That baby's a little piece of shit.
It's so annoying and boring."

38:44.295 --> 38:46.881
And all these other shitty dads
in the audience are, like,

38:46.965 --> 38:50.218
"That's hilarious. I identify."

38:50.343 --> 38:52.262
And their fame just swells

38:52.345 --> 38:56.182
because they become this relatable
family funny man all of a sudden.

38:56.266 --> 38:58.685
Meanwhile, the mom is at home,

38:58.768 --> 39:01.896
chapping her nipples,
feeding the fucking baby,

39:01.980 --> 39:05.442
and wearing a frozen diaper
'cause her pussy needs to heal

39:05.525 --> 39:07.569
from the baby's head shredding it up.

39:07.652 --> 39:08.778
She's busy.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.743
So, I don't know what's gonna
happen to me.

39:18.371 --> 39:20.915
You know, a lot of
my female stand-up comic friends

39:21.040 --> 39:25.086
who are a lot more successful
and famous than me

39:25.170 --> 39:26.838
discouraged me from having a kid.

39:26.921 --> 39:30.258
And they were like, "Ali, why are you
gonna have a kid?

39:30.341 --> 39:32.552
You just gonna become--
You're gonna disappear,

39:32.635 --> 39:35.680
and you're gonna become
some lame stay-at-home mom."

39:37.135 --> 39:39.159
I was like, "Yeah, that's the dream."

39:41.944 --> 39:44.489
That's the point.
This is the ultimate trap.

39:45.656 --> 39:47.533
I won, you know?

39:50.069 --> 39:52.113
Another thing a lot of my friends
said to me

39:52.196 --> 39:54.490
when they were discouraging me
from having a kid,

39:54.573 --> 39:56.742
they were like,
"Why are you gonna have a kid?

39:56.826 --> 40:00.037
Why don't you just travel the world
with your husband

40:00.121 --> 40:03.833
and just do whatever you want
for the rest of your lives

40:03.916 --> 40:05.793
with no kid attached."

40:05.968 --> 40:07.595
I was like, "Yeah, that's cool...

40:07.678 --> 40:09.597
until my husband dies."

40:10.097 --> 40:13.142
Which he's definitely gonna before me.

40:13.893 --> 40:16.687
Because I'm a Asian woman,

40:16.771 --> 40:20.233
and therefore, guaranteed to live
until I'm a billion.

40:23.486 --> 40:27.657
I'm guaranteed,
like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK?

40:28.825 --> 40:31.911
We all know the phrase
"black don't crack."

40:32.878 --> 40:35.214
Well, Asian don't die.

40:38.092 --> 40:41.887
We don't die. Especially the women,
we live forever.

40:41.971 --> 40:44.181
And you know why we're such bad drivers?

40:45.024 --> 40:47.534
Because we're trying to die.

40:51.989 --> 40:55.284
We're like, "Yeah! Let me see
how invincible I really am!"

40:56.118 --> 41:00.081
"Imma make this left hand turn signal
and ignore this red light completely."

41:00.623 --> 41:04.085
"I'm gonna make a right turn--
I changed my mind, it's a U-turn!"

41:05.169 --> 41:07.165
"I changed my mind again. It's a O-turn!"

41:14.845 --> 41:17.422
Every time I get into a car accident...

41:22.687 --> 41:26.732
...I'm like, "Oh, my God, not again!"

41:26.816 --> 41:29.986
I need to hide my face
so that everybody doesn't see

41:30.069 --> 41:32.697
that it's what everybody thought
it was gonna be.

41:35.658 --> 41:37.535
So embarrassing.

41:37.618 --> 41:39.954
My Toyota Corolla is a mess.

41:41.706 --> 41:44.959
There's this huge
bear claw scratch on the side

41:45.042 --> 41:48.072
from this aggressive brick wall
that came out of nowhere.

41:49.630 --> 41:52.425
And then, on the hood,
there's multiple hand prints

41:52.508 --> 41:56.470
from pedestrians who have had to
alert me of their existence.

41:59.015 --> 42:03.019
I don't know what's wrong with me,
but I'm still here, you know?

42:05.938 --> 42:10.234
I need to have children
to keep me company when I get older.

42:10.860 --> 42:11.861
It's lonely.

42:11.944 --> 42:13.738
My mom is 80,

42:13.821 --> 42:16.615
going through a full blown
mid-life crisis.

42:20.828 --> 42:23.998
'Cause she knows that
she's got a century more to go.

42:24.665 --> 42:25.875
And she is so lonely.

42:25.958 --> 42:27.752
All of her white friends, dead.

42:28.544 --> 42:30.337
Her Mexican friends, dead.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.465
Black friends, dead.

42:40.097 --> 42:42.892
I'm just kidding. She doesn't have
any black friends.

42:46.103 --> 42:49.565
Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK?

42:53.360 --> 42:55.780
I need children to be there for me

42:55.905 --> 42:57.948
when I'm older, when I get as old as her.

42:58.032 --> 43:01.035
And when I say be there for me,
I mean pay for me

43:01.118 --> 43:04.288
when my husband isn't around
to support me anymore.

43:04.371 --> 43:06.874
I'm not trying to be one of those
old Chinese ladies

43:06.957 --> 43:10.878
who recycles for a living.
That's not my destiny, OK?

43:11.545 --> 43:14.507
Old Chinese ladies,
they don't give a fuck. They got no shame.

43:14.882 --> 43:16.717
They're like, "I'm just gonna recycle...

43:17.343 --> 43:18.636
go bald...

43:19.178 --> 43:21.013
go to the park, do this shit."

43:37.696 --> 43:40.074
They do that
'cause it's a free activity.

43:41.033 --> 43:45.371
For them. They do it in their--
their big-ass V. Stiviano visor,

43:45.454 --> 43:48.165
their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider-
Boba Fett helmet.

43:49.375 --> 43:53.003
They wear that to protect themselves
from their arch-nemesis, the sun.

43:53.087 --> 43:55.881
Their in a contest to see
who's gonna burn out first.

43:56.674 --> 44:00.469
Old Asian ladies and the sun are like
the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.

44:07.101 --> 44:11.147
I also decided to have a kid because

44:11.230 --> 44:13.399
uh, I'm only 33,

44:13.482 --> 44:15.776
which, I know, is not
technically high-risk,

44:15.860 --> 44:19.822
but my body was starting
to show signs of change.

44:19.905 --> 44:24.451
And it-- And it scared me.
Like, I'm only 33 and...

44:26.412 --> 44:29.790
...my pussy is not as wet
as it used to be.

44:32.543 --> 44:34.587
It's very demoralizing, OK?

44:34.670 --> 44:37.840
Do you remember
when you were 18 years old,

44:37.923 --> 44:42.094
and your pussy was just
sopping wet all the time?

44:42.178 --> 44:44.680
All the time,
you just took it for granted

44:44.763 --> 44:48.601
that you could just reach your hand
down your pants at any given moment,

44:48.684 --> 44:50.686
you throw up the peace sign afterwards,

44:50.769 --> 44:53.814
and there would be that snail-trail
in between your fingers.

44:53.898 --> 44:56.025
Oh, my God, it was so juicy.

44:56.108 --> 44:58.694
You could just blow
a bubble wand with it, just...

45:01.739 --> 45:05.659
"I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!"

45:10.873 --> 45:13.167
I don't know
what kind of mother I'm gonna be.

45:21.258 --> 45:24.219
I'm-- I'm 33, and I did have to get

45:24.303 --> 45:28.057
a little bit of science involved
when trying to get pregnant.

45:28.140 --> 45:29.475
And a lot of that...

45:30.059 --> 45:31.644
is most likely my fault.

45:31.727 --> 45:33.979
Because, when I was in my 20s,

45:34.063 --> 45:36.482
I ate Plan B like skittles.

45:38.484 --> 45:42.029
So, my uterus probably looked
like a smoker's lung.

45:44.907 --> 45:46.909
And I found out

45:46.992 --> 45:50.955
that my progesterone levels
were alarmingly low.

45:51.038 --> 45:54.625
So, then I had to take these
hormone pills that were suppositories,

45:54.750 --> 45:57.920
and Push Pop them up myself
every single night.

45:58.045 --> 46:00.839
And then, at my writing job,
at Fresh Off The Boat,

46:00.923 --> 46:03.926
I would be storyboarding
in front of my co-workers,

46:04.009 --> 46:07.513
and then, at some point,
the pill would inevitably dissolve

46:07.596 --> 46:09.348
and melt into my underwear,

46:09.431 --> 46:12.726
and I had to act like everything was OK,

46:12.810 --> 46:15.562
when everything was clearly not OK.

46:16.355 --> 46:18.816
And then, a side effect
of the progesterone

46:18.899 --> 46:21.443
was that it made me extremely itchy.

46:21.527 --> 46:24.989
So, then I had to find ways
to discretely scratch myself

46:25.072 --> 46:28.659
underneath the conference table,
and then resist the urge

46:28.742 --> 46:31.912
to immediately
smell my fingers afterwards.

46:31.996 --> 46:35.124
I want to be able to smell my fingers

46:35.207 --> 46:37.960
when I wanna smell
my own goddamn fingers.

46:38.043 --> 46:41.422
Housewives, they can just
scratch and sniff all day long.

46:41.505 --> 46:44.675
They just vacuum, scratch, sniff.

46:44.758 --> 46:48.178
They make a sandwich.
"Uh, mmm."

46:48.262 --> 46:52.766
They watch Property Brothers,
scratch, "What's crackin'? Mmm."

46:55.602 --> 46:58.772
Every time you scratch yourself,
all you can think about is,

46:58.856 --> 47:01.859
"When can I smell my fingers?
When can I smell my fingers?

47:01.942 --> 47:04.403
When can I discretely find a way to..."

47:07.948 --> 47:09.408
"...smell my fingers?"

47:09.491 --> 47:12.536
Nature made you urgently curious

47:12.619 --> 47:16.540
to protect you, 'cause you gotta check
that it's all good in the hood.

47:16.707 --> 47:19.501
If it's too funky,
you need to see a doctor.

47:19.585 --> 47:21.628
Your fingers are your first WebMD.

47:28.010 --> 47:30.971
When my husband and I
were trying to have a kid,

47:31.055 --> 47:33.766
a lot of people were like,
"Oh, my God, that's so hot.

47:33.849 --> 47:35.726
You guys doin' a lot of fuckin'?"

47:36.935 --> 47:40.522
No, dude. That's-- That's shit you do
in your 20s, OK?

47:40.606 --> 47:42.232
When in-- When you're in your 30s,

47:42.357 --> 47:45.819
and you've been trying to get pregnant
for a while, it gets very clinical.

47:45.903 --> 47:50.199
You pee on these ovulation strips
that tell you when the eggs are droppin'.

47:50.282 --> 47:52.117
It tells you when it's Easter time.

47:54.203 --> 47:56.955
And I would only fuck him
when it was Easter time.

47:57.039 --> 48:00.000
It was, like, only four days
out of the month, and outside of that,

48:00.084 --> 48:04.088
I would be like, "We're not fuckin'.
I need you to save it.

48:04.254 --> 48:07.216
I want your sperm to be as pent-up,

48:07.299 --> 48:11.011
and as angry and rapey as possible.

48:11.095 --> 48:15.849
So that, when they come out, it's like,
'Release the Kraken!'"

48:16.391 --> 48:18.977
And they just come out like
a bunch of angry refugees

48:19.061 --> 48:21.772
escaping a dictatorship, you know?

48:23.982 --> 48:25.776
And, um...

48:25.901 --> 48:29.655
yeah, and most of the time, like,
we wouldn't even have sex,

48:29.738 --> 48:32.282
'cause I was so tired
when I would come home,

48:32.366 --> 48:35.160
and see the smiley face
on the ovulation strip,

48:35.244 --> 48:37.037
and I'd be like, "OK, it's go time,"

48:37.121 --> 48:39.998
and I would just give my husband
a hand job most of the time,

48:40.082 --> 48:42.876
and he would
close his eyes immediately.

48:42.960 --> 48:45.379
I know what that means, OK?

48:45.462 --> 48:48.048
When somebody
closes their eyes during sex,

48:48.132 --> 48:51.260
it's not because they're
in such ecstasy with you

48:51.343 --> 48:54.388
that-- that they need to close their eyes.

48:54.471 --> 48:56.473
When somebody
closes their eyes during sex,

48:56.557 --> 48:58.517
it's because they're literally trying

48:58.600 --> 49:01.728
to shut the image of your face
out of their head

49:01.812 --> 49:04.690
and instead project two Latina lesbians

49:04.773 --> 49:08.485
that they saw earlier that day on RedTube
onto the back of their eyelids.

49:09.153 --> 49:11.155
Which is fine by me, because then

49:11.280 --> 49:14.116
he doesn't have to see
the expression on my face that says,

49:14.199 --> 49:16.743
"Please, hurry the fuck up."

49:18.120 --> 49:21.498
And then, when he was about to finish,
I could always tell because

49:21.582 --> 49:25.836
the indication is very universal
when a man is about to finish.

49:25.919 --> 49:27.629
It's when they get that...

49:28.672 --> 49:31.508
that stupid-ass look on their face...

49:31.592 --> 49:34.605
...where they look like they just got bit
by a zombie, just...

49:44.771 --> 49:47.441
And then, because we're hippies,
I'd be like, "Hey, hey!

49:47.524 --> 49:51.895
Please look me in the eye and remember
to come with intention, OK?"

49:52.279 --> 49:54.823
And then, I would jump on him,
and hold onto his neck,

49:54.907 --> 49:58.368
and I would just twerk, twerk,
twerk the shit out of him...

49:59.244 --> 50:02.915
and do some of this shit that I learned
in Atlanta.

50:03.290 --> 50:06.710
And then I would turn upside down
immediately afterwards...

50:07.878 --> 50:11.590
to make sure all of that Harvard nectar
would just drain inside of me.

50:12.883 --> 50:15.969
That's right. 'Cause I don't wanna
work anymore.

50:26.688 --> 50:30.651
I'm very grateful to be pregnant
and to be...

50:31.026 --> 50:33.695
this far along, to be
seven and a half months pregnant,

50:33.779 --> 50:37.074
because, last year,
I had a miscarriage,

50:37.157 --> 50:40.035
which is very common. And a lot of women
who are in their 20s

50:40.118 --> 50:42.746
flip out when they hear that.
They're like, "Oh, my God.

50:42.829 --> 50:45.582
That's so dark and terrible.
I can't believe that."

50:45.666 --> 50:48.168
I'm 33. Girl, when you're 33,

50:48.252 --> 50:51.922
you'll know plenty of women
who have had a miscarriage.

50:52.089 --> 50:55.509
It's super common, and I wish
more women would talk about it

50:55.592 --> 50:58.679
so they wouldn't feel so bad
when they go through it.

50:58.762 --> 51:01.473
When I told my mom--
She's from a third world country,

51:01.556 --> 51:03.892
and when I told her I had one,
she was like,

51:03.976 --> 51:07.729
"Uh, yeah. Where I'm from,
that's like losing a pair of shoes.

51:08.689 --> 51:12.985
It's whatevs, OK?"
And everything happens for a reason.

51:13.068 --> 51:17.197
I found out at my six-week sonogram,
which is very early.

51:17.281 --> 51:18.532
And the doctor says to me,

51:18.615 --> 51:23.537
"Oh, my God, I see two sacks,
which means you're having twins."

51:24.204 --> 51:28.375
And I was like, "No!"

51:29.167 --> 51:33.213
And then she said, "But what I don't see
is a heartbeat."

51:33.297 --> 51:37.384
And I was like, "Yes!"

51:37.884 --> 51:41.555
"The Lord is mysterious!"

51:43.265 --> 51:46.935
Don't feel bad, OK?
They were the size of poppy seeds.

51:47.019 --> 51:50.605
I've picked boogers larger than
the twins that I lost.

51:52.524 --> 51:55.235
And most women won't let
their husbands watch

51:55.319 --> 51:57.446
when they're going through a miscarriage.

51:57.529 --> 51:59.489
I sat my husband down in front of me

51:59.573 --> 52:02.367
while I sat on the toilet,
and I was like, "You look."

52:04.036 --> 52:06.163
"You watch the whole thing."

52:06.246 --> 52:08.206
And he felt so bad for me.

52:08.290 --> 52:10.000
And I used it as leverage

52:10.083 --> 52:12.919
and held that shit
over his head for a month

52:13.003 --> 52:17.466
and got him to do whatever the fuck
I wanted him to do for 30 days.

52:17.549 --> 52:20.260
He took me to see Beyoncé.

52:20.344 --> 52:22.596
He bought me a bike off of Craigslist.

52:22.679 --> 52:25.474
That's my miscarriage bike,
and I love it very much.

52:26.767 --> 52:31.313
For 30 days, I finally had
the marriage I always wanted.

52:34.274 --> 52:36.943
I'm scared about
giving childbirth, though.

52:37.027 --> 52:39.613
I'm-- I'm very, very scared of childbirth.

52:39.696 --> 52:42.282
That's why I'm going to hire a doula.

52:42.824 --> 52:45.410
You know what that is?
You know what a doula is?

52:45.494 --> 52:47.412
That's a white hippie witch...

52:50.582 --> 52:53.001
...that blows quinoa into your pussy

52:53.085 --> 52:56.463
to Keyser Söze all the pain away.

52:58.757 --> 53:00.967
A lot of women tried to freak me out.

53:01.093 --> 53:03.553
They tried to freak me out
about childbirth by saying,

53:03.637 --> 53:07.891
"Ali, did you know that
you're gonna poop on the table?"

53:10.310 --> 53:12.396
I was like, "Yeah, I look forward to it."

53:15.107 --> 53:17.901
I'm all backed up from
holding in my shit at work.

53:18.860 --> 53:20.445
I can't wait to cleanse.

53:21.988 --> 53:24.741
It makes sense, like, that you--
that that happens because

53:24.825 --> 53:27.494
when you're in labor,
you push, you push, you push,

53:27.577 --> 53:30.664
and your husband will be asked
to assist in the labor

53:30.747 --> 53:32.791
by lifting up your leg,

53:32.874 --> 53:36.294
which subsequently turns into
a soft serve lever.

53:36.378 --> 53:41.216
You just shit on the floor
in front of the love of your life.

53:41.299 --> 53:44.386
And just when you think that's enough
to make him finally leave you,

53:44.469 --> 53:47.764
boom, a baby comes out,
and he gotta stay.

53:49.349 --> 53:51.685
That's the real
miracle of life, right there.

53:56.690 --> 54:00.694
I can already see how a child
can really take its toll on a marriage,

54:00.819 --> 54:02.696
because the baby
hasn't even come out yet

54:02.779 --> 54:07.159
and I am already so resentful
towards my husband.

54:07.242 --> 54:11.246
So much resentment, especially when
he asks me to do shit around the house.

54:11.329 --> 54:14.916
"Hey, can you
wash the dishes?" "No!"

54:15.000 --> 54:18.545
"Can you water the plants?"
"I am not doing jack shit anymore.

54:18.628 --> 54:22.090
I'm busy makin' a eyeball, OK?

54:22.883 --> 54:26.553
Are you makin' a foot? I didn't think so.
You change the channel."

54:29.931 --> 54:34.895
I can already see how there's, like,
this crazy double standard in our society

54:35.020 --> 54:40.525
of how it takes so little
to be considered a great dad.

54:40.609 --> 54:45.280
And it also takes so little
to be considered a shitty mom.

54:45.363 --> 54:47.741
People praise my husband

54:47.824 --> 54:50.327
for coming to
all of my doctor's appointments with me.

54:50.410 --> 54:54.456
"Oh, my God. I can't believe he comes
to all your doctor's appointments.

54:54.539 --> 54:56.875
He is so supportive."

54:56.958 --> 55:00.003
Guess who else has to go
to those doctor appointments.

55:00.086 --> 55:02.631
Me! I'm the star of the show.

55:03.298 --> 55:06.718
There's nothing for the camera
to see if I'm not there.

55:07.469 --> 55:11.723
But he's the hero for playing
Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn.

55:12.098 --> 55:16.895
Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms
seven months pregnant, I'm a bad mommy.

55:22.484 --> 55:24.152
You know, I-- I-- I, like,

55:24.236 --> 55:27.781
I berate my husband on,
like, a daily basis.

55:28.990 --> 55:31.076
Partially because I really am mad at him.

55:31.159 --> 55:34.871
But mostly out of survival,
because if he leaves me, I'm fucked.

55:35.539 --> 55:40.669
So, I have to chip away
at his self-esteem on a daily basis...

55:41.711 --> 55:44.422
to keep him down
so that he doesn't believe

55:44.506 --> 55:47.842
that he's worthy of
another woman's affection and leaves me.

55:48.468 --> 55:51.596
I gotta keep him around
by keeping him down.

55:55.116 --> 55:57.855
People don't tell you about all this shit
that goes down with your body

55:57.855 --> 55:59.690
when you get pregnant, you know?

55:59.938 --> 56:02.274
Your nipples get huge and dark.

56:02.774 --> 56:04.067
I didn't know that.

56:04.150 --> 56:08.154
I didn't know that they get dark so that
the baby can see, like, a bullseye.

56:09.531 --> 56:11.825
So that the baby can find it easier.

56:11.908 --> 56:15.161
And then, you know, they get big--
they get big, like fingers.

56:15.245 --> 56:19.457
Like, "You, you. You owe me money, you."

56:20.125 --> 56:24.004
My nipples look like Whoppers now,
and naked, I look like a Minion.

56:26.339 --> 56:29.217
But I'm not gonna be one of those
crazy pregnant ladies

56:29.301 --> 56:33.471
who tries to get all back in shape
right after they get pregnant. No.

56:33.555 --> 56:36.057
Hopefully, if you see me in a year,

56:36.141 --> 56:41.271
I will have the kind of body where,
if I do a nude scene on television,

56:41.354 --> 56:44.649
people will commend me
for being courageous.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.737
For doing it.

56:50.322 --> 56:53.867
Now that I'm seven and a half months
pregnant, my pussy's all wet again.

56:54.784 --> 56:57.537
But it's different. It's not like when
I was 18 years old,

56:57.621 --> 56:59.539
when it was like, really hot, you know?

56:59.623 --> 57:02.334
And I was like, "Why is it different?"
And I looked it up,

57:02.417 --> 57:06.504
and my pussy's all wet again because
my-- my body's secreting mucus

57:06.588 --> 57:09.633
to protect the baby
from bacteria attacking it.

57:12.177 --> 57:14.638
That's not the same.

57:14.721 --> 57:19.142
When it's straight up soldier glue,
when it's Neosporin.

57:24.314 --> 57:26.524
So, you know, I-- I, in--

57:26.650 --> 57:30.654
previously, before I met my husband,
I had dated a bunch of losers.

57:30.862 --> 57:33.031
And then, I meet this dream guy,
who's, like,

57:33.114 --> 57:35.200
way more handsome than me,
out of my league,

57:35.283 --> 57:37.035
graduated from Harvard Business School.

57:37.118 --> 57:39.329
Worked hard to trap his ass.

57:40.038 --> 57:43.875
Got him to propose to me.
Oh, my God, then we got married,

57:43.959 --> 57:47.295
all my dreams coming true,
and then we got pregnant,

57:47.379 --> 57:50.882
and recently
we bought our first home together.

57:50.966 --> 57:54.886
And, uh, two weeks
into the escrow process,

57:54.970 --> 57:59.849
I discovered that my beautiful,
Harvard-educated husband

57:59.933 --> 58:03.311
was $70,000 in debt.

58:08.024 --> 58:14.114
And me, with my hard-earned TV money,
paid it all off.

58:21.287 --> 58:25.834
So, as it turns out,
he's the one who trapped me.

58:31.256 --> 58:33.049
How did he do it?

58:33.133 --> 58:35.260
How did he bamboozle me?

58:36.052 --> 58:40.724
Oh! Maybe because he went
to Harvard Business School,

58:40.807 --> 58:45.061
the epicenter of white-collar crime.
He Enron'd my ass.

58:45.145 --> 58:48.898
And now, if I don't work, we die.

58:50.191 --> 58:54.029
Why else do you think I'm performing
seven and a half months pregnant?

58:54.112 --> 58:57.198
All right, I've been Ali Wong.
Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.
