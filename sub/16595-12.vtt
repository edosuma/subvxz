WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:04.903
Mmm!

00:04.938 --> 00:06.371
Dinner looks good.

00:06.406 --> 00:09.441
So do you, but you're not
covered in barbecue sauce.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.578
Although...

00:13.613 --> 00:16.248
(laughs)

00:16.283 --> 00:17.850
Oh.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.520
Well, this is for
tomorrow night's potluck dinner

00:21.555 --> 00:22.687
with the girls.

00:22.722 --> 00:25.857
Tonight,
we are ordering in.

00:25.892 --> 00:28.060
Well, that's just as good
as a home-cooked meal

00:28.095 --> 00:29.761
made with love.

00:29.796 --> 00:32.497
Well, sorry, but I want
tomorrow night to be special.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.566
It's so rare that we have
just our girls here.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.535
Well, you know what
they say about free food,

00:36.570 --> 00:39.171
it's like "Field of Dreams" --
you cook it, and they will come.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.672
Yeah, well,
with the boys here,

00:40.707 --> 00:42.674
it's more like
"Animal House" -- food fight!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.176
(chuckles)

00:44.211 --> 00:47.112
Don't build on my movie thing,
it just hurts us both.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.747
Hey.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.848
Here's the food
you forced me and Kristin

00:49.883 --> 00:51.516
to make for tomorrow.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.885
Oh, thanks. It's so much more
fun when everyone contributes.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.687
Not really.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.756
So can I have $1,000?

00:59.493 --> 01:00.692
Uh, I think you're
a little fuzzy

01:00.727 --> 01:02.327
on the value of a casserole.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.464
Honey, what do you
need $1,000 for?

01:05.499 --> 01:08.467
I need some new recording
equipment to make a decent demo.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.570
Singing into my smart phone
isn't really cutting it anymore.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.240
When I was young, all we had
to sing into was a hairbrush.

01:17.477 --> 01:20.745
I mean -- I mean, girls did.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.314
Okay, so I've
thought about this,

01:22.349 --> 01:23.949
and I thought you guys
could just take the money

01:23.984 --> 01:25.984
out of my college fund since
I'm not using it anyway.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.919
But you<i> will</i> use
that for college.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.454
You know, like successful
musicians --

01:29.489 --> 01:32.457
Lana Del Rey, Grimes,
Florida.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.426
Flo Rida.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.460
What?

01:35.495 --> 01:36.995
(sighs)

01:37.030 --> 01:39.464
When I'm a star,
I won't need my college fund.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.301
You guys can just spend it
on magazines or something.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.737
That money is for college.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.405
Period.

01:47.440 --> 01:52.844
Or try this -- that money is
for college. Question mark.

01:52.879 --> 01:57.082
Not a chance. Hedera.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.317
And that is a punctuation mark
that you don't know about

01:59.352 --> 02:02.320
because you never
went to college.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.922
This is so unfair.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.624
Mandy gets to use her
college fund all the time.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.092
-For college.
-For college.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.362
I've seen her grades.
She's barely in college.

02:10.397 --> 02:11.530
Hey, everybody.
Hi.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.031
This sounds like fun.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.666
I assume they said no.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.135
Haters gonna hate.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.437
That's fine. Uh, I'll give you
the money for the equipment.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.472
What?
What do you mean

02:20.507 --> 02:21.640
you'll give her the money?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.208
It's important.
Somebody has to.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.710
What? No, you don't have that
kind of cash lying around.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.479
I'll spread it
over three credit cards.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.147
It -- It's a stretch,
but it's worth it.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.216
Thank you, Kris. You will be
the first and only person

02:31.251 --> 02:33.519
I am thanking
at the GRAMMYs.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.356
What is a hedera?

02:38.391 --> 02:39.992
(laughs)

02:53.440 --> 02:55.240
I don't buy it.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.743
No one else will
either.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.315
Hey. Here's your senior league
softball uniform, Mr. Alzate.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.683
Oh, thank you, Kyle.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.318
Also, uh, there was
a weird gas smell

03:06.353 --> 03:07.652
coming from your kitchen.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.421
So I lit a bunch
of scented candles.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.893
I hope we have
enough guys to play ball

03:14.928 --> 03:16.761
once Howard
is no longer with us.

03:16.796 --> 03:17.829
Oh, no.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.497
Yeah. Oh, relax.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.032
He's moving to Phoenix.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.234
(sighs)

03:22.269 --> 03:24.469
Because he's dying.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.173
Hey, Kyle.
Is my dad in there?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.841
Yeah.
Well, he went in there,

03:29.876 --> 03:31.843
but he could've
gone out the window.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.479
Or disguised himself
and walked right past me.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.950
Or...
I'll just check.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.287
You wanted to see me?

03:42.322 --> 03:44.055
Eh.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.791
Aw, that joke
never gets old.

03:46.826 --> 03:48.793
It's not a joke
this time.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.362
Your mom and I really
didn't appreciate you

03:50.397 --> 03:52.464
swooping in
and parenting Eve, okay?

03:52.499 --> 03:55.867
What about all the times you
swooped in and parented Boyd?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.035
I don't swoop.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.437
I strut boldly.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.873
And I don't want you paying for
anything about Eve

04:01.908 --> 04:04.809
as long as she's living
under my roof.

04:04.844 --> 04:08.446
Or under<i> a</i> roof.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.981
Somebody has to look out
for her, okay?

04:10.016 --> 04:11.416
It's not like Mandy
where you just give her

04:11.451 --> 04:12.450
whatever she wants.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.386
Name one thing I gave Mandy.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.655
College tuition,
free room and board, uh,

04:16.690 --> 04:17.989
a basement
for her business.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.091
Name four things.

04:20.126 --> 04:22.260
Face it, okay?
Mandy's your favorite.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.296
My favorite what?
Have you met Mandy?

04:24.331 --> 04:25.831
Have you met me?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.905
-Hey, Mr. Alzate?
-Come in.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.507
Hey, you forgot your --

04:35.542 --> 04:37.642
Oh!

04:37.677 --> 04:38.943
What's wrong?

04:38.978 --> 04:40.412
What's wrong?
Is there a spider?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.946
Um, you're naked.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.782
I know, that's why
I'm worried about a spider.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.786
Why are you naked?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.921
I am changing
into my uniform.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.023
Either come in
or stay out. Please.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.825
I am choosing
to stay out, sir.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.895
I -- I feel quite
strongly about it.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.867
Now Kristin thinks
Mandy's our favorite?

05:02.902 --> 05:05.370
That's crazy.
We don't have a favorite.

05:05.405 --> 05:09.174
You know, that --
that they know of.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.942
We do give Mandy
whatever she wants,

05:10.977 --> 05:12.711
but it's really
just to shut her up.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.612
Yeah, but Mandy's
always been the kid

05:14.647 --> 05:16.214
that needed
our help the most.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.682
I mean, I can see
why Kristin would think

05:17.717 --> 05:19.284
that's favoritism.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.121
Well, we -- we got to keep
Mandy alive, I mean, right?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.823
(scoffs)

05:24.858 --> 05:26.358
Eve never asked us
for anything,

05:26.393 --> 05:28.326
and the one time she does,
we turn her down.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.361
I just -- maybe
we should get her

05:29.396 --> 05:30.395
that recording equipment.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.963
Fine.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.166
I'll take it out of
the second wife jewelry fund.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.735
I mean,
this whole thing lasted

05:36.770 --> 05:38.069
a lot longer than
I thought it would.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.238
(laughs)

05:40.273 --> 05:41.973
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

05:42.008 --> 05:43.808
Hi.
Hi, hi, hi.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.977
-Hi.
-Hi, sweetie.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.545
Mm.

05:47.580 --> 05:52.351
Welcome to the family
reunited again yay dinner.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.421
She had a whole 30 minutes
to come up with that.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.922
Everything looks great,
Mom.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.391
Ooh, and you got my favorite
dressing, thanks.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.526
Of course.
Favorite for the favorite.

06:01.561 --> 06:04.062
Still a little second guessing
our parenting, huh?

06:04.097 --> 06:05.764
Oh, didn't know.
Not surprised.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.499
Continue.

06:07.534 --> 06:11.169
Well, you guys think it's not
fair the way we divvy things up,

06:11.204 --> 06:13.571
so we have decided
to even things out a little.

06:13.606 --> 06:14.906
Are we all getting cars?
No.

06:14.941 --> 06:18.176
Oh, my God!
We're all getting cars!

06:18.211 --> 06:20.745
Eve, we've decided we're gonna
pay for the recording equipment.

06:20.780 --> 06:21.946
Nice!

06:21.981 --> 06:24.916
Kind of a wash for me,
but thanks.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.251
Eh, that's typical.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.585
I hate to ask,
but what -- what do --

06:27.620 --> 06:29.020
what do you mean typical?

06:29.055 --> 06:32.290
Oh, 'cause as usual,
little Evie gets everything.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.625
What --<i> I</i> get everything?

06:33.660 --> 06:35.360
You're the one
who gets everything.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.595
Oh, whoa, whoa. So you think
Mandy's the favorite, too?

06:37.630 --> 06:39.798
Wait, me?
(laughs)

06:39.833 --> 06:41.199
No.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.269
That's a joke.
I'm the least favorite.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.438
That's what I keep saying.
Yeah.

06:46.473 --> 06:48.106
Yeah.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.309
Like, I asked you for $800
for a new sewing machine,

06:51.344 --> 06:52.944
you were like,
"No, go to college."

06:52.979 --> 06:56.214
The fact that you're
so grateful makes up for that.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.316
But not with Eve.
It's like, "Oh, yeah,

06:58.351 --> 07:00.985
skip college, go play hippie
music, whatever you want."

07:01.020 --> 07:02.620
Well, you're one to talk.

07:02.655 --> 07:05.490
Yes, I am one to talk.
I don't know what that means.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.292
Well, it means --
it means that you have

07:07.327 --> 07:09.060
all benefited
from being our kids.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.929
Right, so we do things
differently for each one of you.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.630
You know what?
Let's say grace.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.065
-Okay.
-Yeah, like how you get

07:14.100 --> 07:15.767
to live here rent free
with your husband.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.770
Uh, Mom gets to live here
rent free with her husband.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.309
You know, she's, uh,
she's got you there, honey.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.977
(laughs)

07:27.814 --> 07:29.414
Rent free?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.283
Believe me, I pay.

07:32.318 --> 07:36.521
Oh, and you lived here rent free
with a guy for years.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.590
A guy?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.859
Do you mean my baby?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.029
He's still a guy.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.366
(chuckles) She's got
you there, honey.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.834
Mandy, they had
to help Kristin.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.703
She completely
screwed up her life.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.271
Wait.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.606
I-I-I'm doing great now.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.975
Yeah, 'cause Dad handed
you a cushy job.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.177
Let's say grace.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.545
I thought you were
on my side.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.180
Uh, I'm sorry.
Are we pretending like

08:02.215 --> 08:04.148
you got all your pay raises
because you came up

08:04.183 --> 08:06.384
with the brilliant idea
for a restaurant to sell meat?

08:06.419 --> 08:08.019
You know what, uh-uh-uh,
I think -- I think a prayer

08:08.054 --> 08:09.287
right now would be
a really good idea.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.522
-Great idea.
-I -- I have earned

08:10.557 --> 08:11.656
everything
that I have gotten.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.625
Oh, yeah,
you earned that.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.293
Your silverware at home
sure looks a lot like

08:15.328 --> 08:16.394
the stuff
at the restaurant.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.197
Whoa!

08:19.232 --> 08:21.299
This is where you could
use that recording equipment.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.635
And -- and you are using
your previous incompetence

08:23.670 --> 08:25.637
at everything to
milk these two even though

08:25.672 --> 08:26.738
you're doing great now.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.573
Thank you.
I mean, shut up.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.141
Don't tell her to shut up.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.410
Wait, you sold me out.
You can both shut up.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.912
I don't need to shut up
because I'm leaving.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.380
Sit back down.
Sit back down.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.081
-Wait, come back.
-Both of you sit back down.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.216
-Wait, but --
-You're not leaving.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.385
Sit back down!

08:51.197 --> 08:53.298
Sorry, did you want
to say grace?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.707

Hey, Mike Baxter here

18:42.788 --> 18:44.088
Come on.
They love each other.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.956
-Yeah.
-No one's gonna take the hit.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.191
We need to talk.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.260
-Okay.
-You know, guys, it's okay

18:49.295 --> 18:50.361
if you didn't
choose anybody.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.029
Oh. Oh, no,
we chose someone.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.097
Yeah.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.499
We chose Eve.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.868
Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.104
What do you --

19:00.139 --> 19:04.275
You -- you picked Eve
to suffer? Your baby sister?

19:04.310 --> 19:08.179
Those were the rules
for your little lesson.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.381
Oh, wait a minute,
we're being played.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.917
They think we'll back down
because Eve's our favorite.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.156
Mike, Mike.

19:19.191 --> 19:22.193
Allegedly.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.562
Oh, no.
Nope, we're serious.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.531
But we, uh, we realized
something more important.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.300
You're the real enemy.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.668
-Hey!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.036
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

19:32.071 --> 19:35.039
I'd like to see
where this is going.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.341
You guys tried to play us off
against each other.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.343
So from now on,
no matter what you do,

19:39.378 --> 19:40.978
we're gonna stick up
for each other.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.416
Damn! That's the one thing
I didn't want.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.484
Since Mandy and I
are coming out ahead,

19:47.519 --> 19:48.752
we are going to kick in

19:48.787 --> 19:50.854
and pay for
Eve's recording equipment.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.390
Which means
we all get what we want.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.793
So there's your lesson,
old man. Suck it!

19:58.864 --> 20:00.764
Come on, sisters,
let's grab some food

20:00.799 --> 20:02.866
before they decide
only two of us can eat.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.602
Yeah, I'm starving.
This is great.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.704
We should be sisters
more often.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.874
Well, I like that
they love each other,

20:10.909 --> 20:13.944
but I'm not wild
about them hating us.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.112
Hmm.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.315
I'm okay with both.
Let's eat.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.258
ED: Kyle, could you come here
a minute please?

20:29.295 --> 20:31.229
All right, entering, sir.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.634
All right, I am
lowering my hand.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.535
And I am turning around.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.304
Hey, hey,
just calm down.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.406
I just want you
to check this mole.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.241
Oh, dear God.

20:44.276 --> 20:45.876
(laughs)

20:45.911 --> 20:49.546
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, all right.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.814
How about a catch, huh?

20:50.849 --> 20:52.249
Oh, I'd love that, sir.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.884
You know, when
my dad threw stuff at me,

20:53.919 --> 20:56.320
he never expected me
to catch it.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.089
Here.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.724
Just put this on, here.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.825
My own uniform.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.460
Yes. You bet.

21:03.495 --> 21:06.096
And -- and -- and here.

21:06.131 --> 21:09.066
And this.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.235
Wow, my own wig.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.636
Yeah.

21:12.671 --> 21:13.837
Why?

21:13.872 --> 21:16.006
You want to
play catch or not?

21:16.041 --> 21:18.075
I think so.

21:18.110 --> 21:22.246
Look, Howard's dead,
all right?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.947
You're batting fifth.

21:23.982 --> 21:27.318
After the game,
we'll all go for a steam.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.857
