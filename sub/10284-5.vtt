WEBVTT

00:03.726 --> 00:05.104
Previously on ER:

00:05.134 --> 00:06.574
I'll be back to
work next month.

00:06.604 --> 00:08.446
Ray Barnett.
I don't think we've officially met.

00:08.476 --> 00:09.189
Katey.

00:09.219 --> 00:11.486
- You two live together?
- Oh, we were roommates.

00:11.516 --> 00:12.785
Hope you had benefits.

00:12.815 --> 00:14.631
You don't want to have anything
to do with me.

00:14.661 --> 00:16.049
What about your little brother?

00:16.079 --> 00:17.479
He'd like to get
to know you, Greg.

00:17.488 --> 00:18.500
He just met me.

00:18.534 --> 00:20.562
I mean, ain't we brothers?

00:21.791 --> 00:22.928
Curtis Ames?

00:22.950 --> 00:25.722
Left-sided paralysis
following an embolic stroke.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.790
But I thought the
case had no merit.

00:27.826 --> 00:29.282
Guy wants his day in court.

00:29.315 --> 00:32.040
It doesn't reflect on your
abilities as a physician.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.340
Skiles has got them working.
And, with big ol' Ben Wallace,

00:39.377 --> 00:40.950
they're definitely going
to the playoffs again.

00:40.985 --> 00:43.752
I remember when the NBA
used to mean something.

00:43.788 --> 00:46.043
Oscar Robertson, Walt Frazier.

00:46.075 --> 00:48.062
Now it's all a bunch of
gangsters with tattoos.

00:48.097 --> 00:50.530
- And cornrows.
- And slam dunks.

00:50.565 --> 00:53.121
Oh, my!
Hey, now, oh, now, hey, now.

00:53.158 --> 00:55.783
- Set of lungs on that one!
- Boy, if I was 20 years younger...

00:55.815 --> 00:57.393
You'd still be her granddaddy.

00:59.836 --> 01:02.312
- Is that Dr. Gregory Pratt?
- The one and only.

01:02.346 --> 01:04.242
What are you doing down
here on the South Side?

01:04.278 --> 01:06.981
I heard you bought a
condo on the Gold Coast.

01:07.205 --> 01:09.153
You drive down here in
the Beemer or the Benz?

01:09.186 --> 01:11.183
Hey, I walked from
my apartment.

01:11.326 --> 01:13.640
- How long has your hand been shaking?
- Long as I can remember.

01:13.676 --> 01:15.231
- Been to the doctor?
- What for?

01:15.266 --> 01:16.863
Lou Sanders' wife
was having headaches.

01:16.896 --> 01:19.950
20 grand in tests so they could
tell her to take an aspirin.

01:19.985 --> 01:22.403
Lanny Cole checked in the
hospital for a stomachache.

01:22.437 --> 01:24.471
Next day,
he checked out through the morgue.

01:24.508 --> 01:26.520
So what are you saying?
Nobody here goes to the doctor?

01:26.558 --> 01:28.480
- Hell, no. Not me.
- Well, you should.

01:28.516 --> 01:31.751
That's right. Dr.
Pratt needs to make them car payments.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.991
But seriously,
you need to get your pressure checked.

01:35.027 --> 01:36.402
They do that at the drugstore.

01:36.437 --> 01:38.822
- Your sugar, your prostate...
- No !

01:39.465 --> 01:41.730
I wouldn't let Halle Berry
stick her finger up my ass.

01:41.766 --> 01:43.830
I sure as hell ain't
going to let you.

01:44.376 --> 01:46.022
I'll see you fools later.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.051
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:50.626 --> 01:51.521
Greg!

01:51.935 --> 01:54.472
- Greg!
- Chaz. What's up, man?

01:54.505 --> 01:55.910
What's up?
It's been a while, man.

01:55.945 --> 01:57.332
Yeah, man. Too long.
What are you doing around here?

01:57.366 --> 01:59.381
I'm just waiting for
a friend before class.

01:59.416 --> 02:01.111
Okay. Where'd you
wind up at school?

02:01.145 --> 02:02.782
- UIC.
- That's good, man.

02:02.815 --> 02:04.971
- So how's it going over there?
- It's going all right.

02:04.975 --> 02:06.362
I'm running a little late.

02:06.746 --> 02:08.721
Yeah. Me, too.
I got to get out of here.

02:09.168 --> 02:10.571
We should kick it sometime.

02:10.604 --> 02:12.331
Definitely. You
know where I am.

02:13.097 --> 02:16.160
- Cool. Good seeing you, man.
- You, too. Be safe.

02:17.256 --> 02:20.901
You'll probably be home before me,
and Miriam has to leave at 6:00.

02:21.706 --> 02:22.720
Okay.

02:23.335 --> 02:28.143
Okay, Joe,
let's review PEA, hmm?

02:28.175 --> 02:30.993
Treatable conditions
include hypovolemia,

02:31.025 --> 02:32.611
tension pneumothorax,

02:32.938 --> 02:35.593
cardiac tamponade, MI and...

02:36.165 --> 02:38.182
and... what's
another cause of PEA?

02:39.017 --> 02:41.010
A reversible etiology of PEA.

02:41.386 --> 02:43.792
- Massive pulmonary embolus.
- See, how could I forget that?

02:43.825 --> 02:44.721
You'll be fine.

02:44.758 --> 02:46.651
I don't know.
My brain is like...

02:46.815 --> 02:47.893
Sorry.

02:48.447 --> 02:50.541
Sorry, sorry.

02:50.645 --> 02:53.462
- I have to review this.
- Ten times?

02:53.497 --> 02:56.243
I gave my deposition a year ago.
It looks really bad

02:56.277 --> 02:58.210
- if I contradict myself.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.590
Just tell the truth.
You didn't do anything... Sorry.

03:03.218 --> 03:04.200
Okay.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.730
Who's that, huh?

03:08.767 --> 03:10.401
Want to go see
who's at the door?

03:11.957 --> 03:14.142
Who's at the door? It's Miriam.

03:14.177 --> 03:15.851
She's going to take
you to the park.

03:16.078 --> 03:19.151
I suppose, if I really can't remember
something, I could run it by the Attending,

03:19.188 --> 03:22.830
but I just don't want to bug them all
day, like I'm a med student or something.

03:25.356 --> 03:26.403
You okay?

03:27.106 --> 03:30.550
No. The guy's going to be so
sympathetic to the jury...

03:30.587 --> 03:32.010
But he doesn't have a case.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.171
You're going to be fine.

03:33.206 --> 03:35.902
If I lose, they report me
to the National Data Bank.

03:35.938 --> 03:38.503
It follows me wherever I go
for the rest of my career.

03:38.865 --> 03:42.221
I could be turned down for a job.
It could cut back our income. It can...

03:42.457 --> 03:44.722
- You want me to come to court?
- No. You got a shift.

03:44.757 --> 03:48.502
Well, they've been doing just fine
without me for the past couple of months.

03:48.535 --> 03:51.991
No. It's more important
for you to be at work.

03:53.226 --> 03:54.183
Okay.

03:54.618 --> 03:55.611
Good luck.

03:57.378 --> 03:58.582
- Thanks.
- Call me.

04:06.806 --> 04:08.911
The plaintiff's attorney
will provoke you--

04:08.946 --> 04:10.253
try to get under your skin.

04:10.287 --> 04:11.571
So you need to stay cool.

04:11.606 --> 04:13.801
If you get defensive,
the jury will turn against you.

04:13.835 --> 04:15.422
- Yeah.
- And keep it brief.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.433
If you elaborate,
they'll think you're being evasive.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.310
Don't worry about getting
the whole story out at once.

04:19.348 --> 04:21.589
I'll have a chance to ask
follow-up questions later.

04:21.625 --> 04:25.103
Right. Um... I'll...
I'll meet you inside.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:03.805 --> 05:06.032
Mr. Ames, I'm...
I'm sorry we're here.

05:06.068 --> 05:09.930
I was hoping this wouldn't
have to go to trial.

05:12.737 --> 05:14.773
I came in with a cough,

05:15.098 --> 05:17.133
and you sent me out a cripple.

05:38.696 --> 05:40.822
I'm willing to pick up a few
boards from the night shift.

05:40.855 --> 05:42.781
Diverticular abscess awaiting

05:42.816 --> 05:44.593
- CT guided drain...
- Hey stranger, welcome back.

05:44.626 --> 05:46.683
- Thanks.
- I want to see pictures.

05:46.835 --> 05:50.031
Diverticular abscess
awaiting CT guided drainage.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.791
- A-fib patient...
- Hey, Abby.

05:51.828 --> 05:54.722
This is kind of embarrassing, but I never
got around to wrapping your baby gift.

05:54.758 --> 05:56.323
- Oh, that's great.
- Ray?

05:57.498 --> 05:58.320
Thanks.

05:58.447 --> 06:00.682
A-fib patient with rapid
ventricular response...

06:00.716 --> 06:02.702
I dispo'd Mr.
Kerosene to psych.

06:03.057 --> 06:04.423
He drank kerosene?

06:04.458 --> 06:05.951
More like a high colonic.

06:05.985 --> 06:07.203
Hi, Abby. I'm Tony Gates.

06:07.237 --> 06:08.910
Hi. Didn't you used to be...?

06:08.945 --> 06:10.303
A paramedic. Yeah.
Now I'm an intern.

06:10.338 --> 06:11.731
Next week,
he wants to be a cowboy.

06:11.767 --> 06:12.940
Astronaut.

06:14.465 --> 06:15.822
I could use some help here.

06:16.057 --> 06:18.950
- I got half his tongue on ice.
- Oh, man. How did that happen?

06:18.985 --> 06:20.170
Wife bit it off.

06:20.206 --> 06:21.420
Why did she do that?

06:21.908 --> 06:23.720
She says he talks too much.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.740
All right, come on.
Let's put him in Curtain Two.

06:25.777 --> 06:28.562
Liter of saline and a crit.
Ray, you're with me.

06:28.595 --> 06:31.710
Abby, grab some charts and...
Gates, you're with Abby.

06:31.747 --> 06:33.370
Cunnilingus interruptus.

06:33.806 --> 06:35.502
They did a Grand Rounds
on it last year.

06:35.538 --> 06:37.321
Abdominal fullness.
This isn't too bad.

06:38.156 --> 06:40.261
Congratulations on the bambino.
It's a boy, right?

06:40.298 --> 06:41.221
Yep.

06:42.538 --> 06:44.320
- Can you check the BP?
- All right.

06:44.797 --> 06:46.840
Hey, Mr. Dolan.
How you feeling?

06:46.875 --> 06:48.760
Must be weird coming back
after all this time, huh?

06:48.794 --> 06:49.682
A little bit.

06:49.801 --> 06:52.088
- 70 palp.
- Pulsatile abdominal mass.

06:52.110 --> 06:53.352
We'd better move him.

06:54.939 --> 06:57.263
- Sam, this guy is hypotensive.
- What?

06:57.295 --> 06:59.400
- His vitals were normal at triage.
- Not anymore.

06:59.435 --> 07:01.122
Add a second line,
four of O-neg.

07:01.158 --> 07:02.731
- Labs?
- Dr. Gates?

07:02.766 --> 07:06.511
CBC with platelets, chem-7,
protime, cross and type four.

07:06.547 --> 07:08.881
Good, but add a hemocue, EKG,
and let's get surgery in on this.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.261
All right. What do you think?
Abdominal aortic aneurysm?

07:11.296 --> 07:13.130
Classic presentation
for a triple-A.

07:13.165 --> 07:14.093
You think it burst?

07:14.128 --> 07:16.363
No. He'd be dead.
It's probably a steady leak.

07:16.397 --> 07:17.882
You set up for ultrasound?

07:17.916 --> 07:19.681
We're going to have to
call radiology for that.

07:19.718 --> 07:22.293
- I'm talking about the ER ultrasound.
- It's still out for repair.

07:22.327 --> 07:24.360
- How are we supposed to...?
- Radiology brings it over.

07:24.395 --> 07:26.500
- How long does that take?
- Depends on how busy they are.

07:26.537 --> 07:28.542
Wow! Great to be back.

07:28.577 --> 07:30.493
Pressure's up to
90 with saline.

07:30.686 --> 07:34.143
All right. He looks like he's okay.
I'll call for your ultrasound.

07:34.176 --> 07:35.322
O-neg is here.

07:36.115 --> 07:39.022
So, what's the big guy doing today?
Watching the baby?

07:39.057 --> 07:40.782
No. He's in court.

07:41.118 --> 07:45.440
Mr. Ames,
what made you go to the E.R.

07:45.906 --> 07:48.951
on February 13, 2004?

07:49.788 --> 07:51.373
Because I had a cough.

07:51.788 --> 07:53.680
My boss, he brought me in.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.743
I thought it was
nothing, but...

07:56.777 --> 07:59.340
he didn't want me working
until I got it checked out.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.862
- How long is the wait?
- Don't talk, please.

08:06.536 --> 08:07.972
How long until I
see the doctor?

08:08.007 --> 08:10.251
I don't know.
Could be 12 hours.

08:10.288 --> 08:11.550
12 hours?

08:12.228 --> 08:14.461
12 is good.
We're not that busy.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.933
It's okay, Curtis.
I'll get someone to cover you.

08:16.965 --> 08:18.361
No, no. I can work.

08:19.768 --> 08:22.771
How about I sign in and
come back later tonight?

08:22.808 --> 08:24.580
You'll lose your place in line.

08:25.308 --> 08:27.432
So I just sit here in the
waiting room for 12 hours?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.583
That's how it works.
Be right back.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.952
This seems kind of crazy.

08:35.988 --> 08:37.501
How about I just get
checked tomorrow?

08:37.508 --> 08:39.640
I need a note you're
not contagious.

08:39.674 --> 08:41.231
I got insurance issues.

08:41.615 --> 08:43.241
Don't give this job away.

08:43.277 --> 08:45.231
I'm going to be there tomorrow.

08:45.465 --> 08:48.902
Dr. Kovac,
when did you first see Mr. Ames?

08:49.215 --> 08:52.920
I was working at the Admit Desk
when he signed in at Triage.

08:52.957 --> 08:54.351
So how long till
I see the doctor?

08:54.386 --> 08:55.683
Hard to say, sir.

08:55.715 --> 08:58.191
If you're stable,
it could be up to 12 hours.

08:58.226 --> 08:59.551
Hours?!

08:59.948 --> 09:01.721
We have a lot of
sick people here.

09:02.618 --> 09:05.070
Let me just sign in,
and I'll just come back later tonight.

09:05.107 --> 09:06.661
I'm sorry. We can't do that.

09:06.695 --> 09:09.060
So I got to wait in the
waiting room for 12 hours?

09:09.386 --> 09:10.672
I'll be right back.

09:14.958 --> 09:16.260
They can't do this!

09:16.296 --> 09:17.511
Everything okay, Chuny?

09:17.548 --> 09:19.221
Yeah. He'll settle down.

09:19.256 --> 09:21.460
Do not give that job away!
I will be there.

09:21.496 --> 09:24.462
A lot of patients get
angry about the wait.

09:24.716 --> 09:28.821
Nurse Marquez was able to defuse
the situation before it escalated.

09:29.915 --> 09:31.030
I'm in.

09:31.168 --> 09:32.881
You can do the next one.
Sorry. I just had to...

09:32.917 --> 09:34.840
No, that's cool. Good breath sounds.
You haven't lost your touch.

09:34.877 --> 09:37.461
- BP's 80.
- All right, I need the ultrasound.

09:37.498 --> 09:38.833
They're doing a
rule out ectopic.

09:38.868 --> 09:40.011
And where's surgery?

09:40.046 --> 09:41.321
Their med student's
right there.

09:41.347 --> 09:44.163
- That's not doing us any good.
- I paged them twice.

09:44.228 --> 09:46.792
Listen. How did
it go yesterday?

09:46.825 --> 09:49.003
- How did what go?
- Court. I heard you had to testify.

09:49.035 --> 09:50.062
Oh. It was fine.

09:50.097 --> 09:52.720
Uh, a lot of questions
about procedure and policy.

09:52.756 --> 09:54.553
But I don't think
they have a case.

09:55.108 --> 09:57.031
Here come the cavalry!

09:57.405 --> 09:58.742
Enlighten me.

09:59.276 --> 10:02.050
Hypotensive pulsatile
abdominal mass.

10:02.088 --> 10:03.791
Say no more.
Red line to the O.R.

10:03.827 --> 10:05.763
- We're waiting on ultrasound.
- Wrong.

10:05.796 --> 10:07.072
We're not waiting
on ultrasound?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.680
Neela, what happens when we
wait for diagnostic tests

10:09.718 --> 10:10.963
on a ruptured triple-A?

10:10.995 --> 10:13.071
Attempts to stabilize are fruitless.
Investigations delay

10:13.108 --> 10:15.421
definitive therapies and increase
the risk of exsanguination.

10:15.455 --> 10:16.931
With a 90% mortality.

10:16.966 --> 10:18.380
His crit's not so bad-- 32.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.711
- Meaningless drivel.
- What if it's not a triple A?

10:20.748 --> 10:22.330
Then it's something else
that requires surgery.

10:22.365 --> 10:24.252
Radiology's bringing
over ultrasound now.

10:24.286 --> 10:25.432
He'll be dead by then.

10:25.467 --> 10:27.153
- It'll be a few seconds.
- Just zip it, Sparky.

10:27.185 --> 10:28.883
- Look, we are admitting him.
- Sparky?

10:28.915 --> 10:30.000
Let's go!

10:30.838 --> 10:32.411
Did you need me
to keep bagging?

10:32.448 --> 10:34.362
Sure, as long as
you don't talk.

10:34.398 --> 10:37.573
Oh, by the way, Abby Lockhart.
Lovely to meet you.

10:39.825 --> 10:42.990
At what point did you assume
responsibility for Mr. Ames' care?

10:43.025 --> 10:45.680
The nurse was concerned
about his oxygen level,

10:45.715 --> 10:47.700
so she asked me to see him.

10:50.658 --> 10:52.140
Curtis Ames?

10:59.366 --> 11:01.823
Hi, I'm Doctor Kovac.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.450
What is that?

11:03.486 --> 11:06.213
Uh, low oxygen.

11:07.495 --> 11:12.173
Or just maybe a
dirty fingernail.

11:12.536 --> 11:15.063
Wood stains--
they don't wash off so good.

11:15.095 --> 11:16.603
What kind of work do you do?

11:17.105 --> 11:18.490
Custom carpentry.

11:18.527 --> 11:19.843
Doors,

11:19.905 --> 11:23.143
built-in bookshelves,
armoires, you name it.

11:23.275 --> 11:26.652
My father had a wood
shop when I was a kid.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.013
I used to play with the
shavings from the lathe.

11:29.046 --> 11:30.353
I love the smell.

11:33.916 --> 11:35.021
How's it sound?

11:35.055 --> 11:36.782
Well, like pneumonia.

11:36.818 --> 11:38.473
You should be admitted
to the hospital.

11:38.507 --> 11:39.402
Admitted?

11:39.436 --> 11:41.030
Yeah, stay for a
couple of days.

11:41.066 --> 11:43.942
No, no.
I start a custom remodel today.

11:44.276 --> 11:47.683
Your temp is 102,
your oxygen level is down to 90

11:47.716 --> 11:51.270
and your X ray shows your right
middle lobe is full of infection.

11:52.376 --> 11:56.762
Look, if you want to get better, we need
to give you I.V. antibiotics, okay?

11:59.276 --> 12:02.900
After he examined you,
then what happened?

12:02.936 --> 12:05.652
He left me alone with a nurse
who couldn't start an I.V.

12:09.975 --> 12:12.260
Okay, this time I get a flash.

12:12.715 --> 12:13.902
Good. That's good, right?

12:13.938 --> 12:16.181
But it won't thread...
I'm sorry.

12:16.218 --> 12:17.941
Keep pressure on this.

12:18.325 --> 12:19.553
I know the drill.

12:19.588 --> 12:21.991
Anyone ever tell you
you have bad veins?

12:22.498 --> 12:24.631
How about just giving
me a shot in the butt?

12:24.666 --> 12:26.953
The antibiotics
are ordered I.V.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.411
Can I talk to my doctor?

12:29.448 --> 12:31.473
He's with a trauma
patient right now.

12:32.755 --> 12:34.341
How about after he's done?

12:34.377 --> 12:35.632
It could be a while...

12:35.816 --> 12:39.210
Here we go,
fourth time's the charm.

12:44.195 --> 12:48.143
And how long was it before Doctor
Kovac came to your bedside?

12:48.765 --> 12:50.463
It was more than an hour.

12:52.137 --> 12:55.330
I saw him working
on the computer,

12:55.928 --> 12:58.133
he was talking to some nurses,

12:58.597 --> 12:59.823
then...

13:01.286 --> 13:03.571
he ate a bagel
with cream cheese.

13:03.808 --> 13:07.322
I think it was poppy seed.

13:08.226 --> 13:09.883
And how did that make you feel?

13:09.915 --> 13:11.682
Objection, irrelevant.

13:11.718 --> 13:13.673
On the contrary, Your Honor,
it goes to state of mind

13:13.706 --> 13:15.443
and his ability to
make decisions.

13:15.865 --> 13:16.940
Overruled.

13:16.977 --> 13:18.173
You may answer.

13:21.797 --> 13:24.151
I felt alone...

13:25.985 --> 13:27.201
forgotten.

13:28.617 --> 13:30.862
Like nobody there
cared about me.

13:34.538 --> 13:36.782
I'm just saying he's
a frail old man

13:36.818 --> 13:39.340
who deserves the benefit of
diagnostic confirmation.

13:39.377 --> 13:41.753
The patient is now on
the surgical service,

13:41.785 --> 13:43.460
not the ER service.

13:43.495 --> 13:45.952
Why don't you go downstairs and pull
a cockroach out of someone's ear?

13:45.988 --> 13:47.803
- Neela...
- He's not stable, Abby.

13:47.836 --> 13:49.180
BP's 90 systolic.

13:49.217 --> 13:51.491
Five minutes for an ultrasound
is not going to kill him.

13:51.608 --> 13:53.183
I picked up a sterile sleeve.

13:53.216 --> 13:55.193
Why do you people
insist on annoying me?

13:55.226 --> 13:56.340
It'll only take a few minutes.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.501
10 blade...
I want these two out of my O.R.

13:58.535 --> 13:59.603
Shirley, call security.

13:59.636 --> 14:01.863
All right, all right.
Dab the bleeders, Katey.

14:01.896 --> 14:03.002
Nice working with you guys.

14:03.038 --> 14:04.001
Bovie.

14:04.038 --> 14:06.232
- Stand back!
- Irrigation! Saline!

14:08.568 --> 14:11.432
Unplug the Bovie!
Unplug the Bovie.

14:11.467 --> 14:13.810
And turn off that oxygen,
before the whole room goes up.

14:17.966 --> 14:22.312
Dr. Kovac,
when the nurses couldn't start an I.V.,

14:22.695 --> 14:24.763
what action did you take?

14:24.796 --> 14:28.322
I knew I needed to place a
catheter into a deeper vein.

14:29.857 --> 14:30.881
How you doing?

14:31.837 --> 14:33.920
I didn't know you
ordered acupuncture.

14:34.755 --> 14:37.173
- I'm Sonya Ames.
- Hi. Luka Kovac.

14:37.206 --> 14:38.722
Thanks for taking care of him.

14:39.355 --> 14:41.502
Well, since we can't get an I.V.
in your arm,

14:41.536 --> 14:44.613
I'd like to place a central
line under your collarbone.

14:46.175 --> 14:48.220
That sounds pretty involved.

14:48.258 --> 14:50.593
We need a route to
give I.V. antibiotics,

14:50.625 --> 14:53.191
or we cannot treat the
pneumonia effectively.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.422
I'll numb up your skin
and guide a catheter in

14:56.457 --> 14:57.993
at the top of your chest.

14:58.356 --> 15:01.290
There are risks of bleeding,
infection, collapsed lung,

15:01.325 --> 15:03.431
but all of those
can be treated.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.020
I've got to think about...
I've got to think about it.

15:08.055 --> 15:10.272
Wait. No, he doesn't.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.821
If you need some
time to consider...

15:13.857 --> 15:17.000
He's just being stubborn.
He hasn't been to a doctor in 20 years.

15:17.035 --> 15:18.950
I never get sick, baby.

15:18.987 --> 15:21.931
You can barely catch your breath,
you've been coughing so much.

15:21.966 --> 15:23.840
It's not that bad, really.

15:24.208 --> 15:27.462
Listen, I just want him to get better.
We'll do whatever it takes, okay?

15:27.497 --> 15:29.901
Well, if you want the procedure
you need to sign this form.

15:33.806 --> 15:36.462
Now come on, baby,
I've got to get back to work.

15:44.996 --> 15:47.242
He didn't want to
be in the E.R.

15:47.277 --> 15:51.411
He didn't like doctors, so I felt
I needed to treat him aggressively.

15:51.447 --> 15:52.581
He said it was the
only way to go.

15:52.616 --> 15:55.831
If he left, I was worried he'd
get worse and wouldn't come back.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.691
He told me complications
were extremely rare.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.732
It was no big deal,
that he does these every day.

16:00.765 --> 16:03.102
His wife works, he's all alone.

16:03.137 --> 16:04.180
My opinion didn't matter.

16:04.216 --> 16:07.710
If he took pills, he could have
died at home and no one would know.

16:07.748 --> 16:11.132
He gave me and my wife no other options,
no other choices.

16:13.035 --> 16:15.792
We were both really,
really scared.

16:22.177 --> 16:24.420
- Can we grab you a sandwich?
- No, thanks.

16:41.316 --> 16:43.990
Hey, Timmy. Uh, is Abby around?

16:45.986 --> 16:49.710
No, no, if she's in surgery,
then don't bother.

16:49.806 --> 16:52.040
That's okay,
I'll try later. Thanks.

17:01.217 --> 17:03.520
- Tricuspid regurg.
- Ah, the irony.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.730
A bad heart valve.

17:04.767 --> 17:07.671
Left him with right-sided failure
and a big, pulsating liver.

17:07.704 --> 17:09.633
- So the mass was his liver?
- Yep.

17:09.666 --> 17:12.411
And the fire saved him
from unnecessary surgery.

17:12.445 --> 17:14.380
So a slightly
scorched med student

17:14.415 --> 17:16.612
and some burned drapes
saved the guy's life.

17:16.646 --> 17:18.060
Lucky guy. Had minor burns.

17:18.095 --> 17:19.130
Excuse me.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.441
Forget how to use that thing?

17:28.016 --> 17:31.360
No, I just... I didn't want to
be one of those crazy mothers

17:31.397 --> 17:33.523
that checks in with the
baby-sitter every hour.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.942
My baby-sitter used to
tie me to my high chair.

17:36.447 --> 17:38.023
I'm sure yours is much better.

17:39.507 --> 17:41.570
After your first
dose of antibiotics,

17:41.607 --> 17:43.820
how long were you in the E.R.?

17:45.156 --> 17:46.413
A long time.

17:47.558 --> 17:48.912
Over three days.

17:49.606 --> 17:50.870
Three days?

17:51.525 --> 17:53.071
In the E.R.?

17:54.706 --> 17:58.112
They said that there were no
other beds in the hospital, so...

17:58.146 --> 18:00.542
Excuse me,
I need to use the bathroom.

18:00.576 --> 18:01.753
I'll let your nurse know.

18:01.787 --> 18:03.381
I don't think that
I'll be able to...

18:03.417 --> 18:05.970
- I said I'll let your nurse know.
- It's kind of urgent. Please.

18:07.007 --> 18:12.513
So you stayed in the
hall all that time?

18:12.547 --> 18:14.933
I mean,
they put me in the back at night

18:14.968 --> 18:16.932
so that I could try
to get some sleep.

18:18.437 --> 18:20.372
- Get off me, bitch! Let me go!
- Louie partied a little too hard.

18:20.407 --> 18:23.633
I'd say we're dealing with coke,
PCP, and EtOH.

18:23.668 --> 18:27.092
- You're going to need hard restraints.
- I'll rip your head off, I swear to God!

18:27.576 --> 18:31.121
They kept saying I'd get a regular
room after the first day, but...

18:31.587 --> 18:32.943
it never happened.

18:34.915 --> 18:35.912
Nurse?

18:37.186 --> 18:38.212
Nurse?

18:38.737 --> 18:40.780
I never got my breakfast.

18:40.816 --> 18:42.181
You may be NPO.

18:43.595 --> 18:44.693
What's that?

18:44.978 --> 18:46.670
We have to look at your orders.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.793
Where's Dr. Kovac?

18:50.828 --> 18:52.203
He's not working today.

18:53.127 --> 18:55.231
So who...
who's my doctor, then?

18:55.628 --> 18:57.000
I have to check.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.091
Every 12 hours an
oncoming resident

19:01.128 --> 19:04.572
assumed responsibility for Mr.
Ames' care.

19:04.648 --> 19:07.760
His progress was discussed,
and he was improving.

19:07.827 --> 19:10.790
So it was the nurses who were
watching him more closely?

19:10.825 --> 19:11.803
Yes.

19:11.837 --> 19:13.860
Dr. Kovac, the State recommends

19:13.896 --> 19:17.512
an E.R.
patient-to-nurse ratio of four-to-one.

19:17.625 --> 19:21.953
Yet, during Mr.
Ames' stay, the ratio was eight-to-one.

19:22.038 --> 19:25.462
That's eight patients
for every nurse.

19:26.038 --> 19:27.443
How is that possible?

19:27.477 --> 19:30.311
We can't control how many
patients come into the E.R.

19:30.346 --> 19:33.920
Dr. Kovac, you know that those standards
are in place for patient safety.

19:33.956 --> 19:38.262
So on a day when the standards
were off by a factor of 100%,

19:38.298 --> 19:41.223
did you discuss this with
a hospital administrator?

19:41.255 --> 19:42.183
No.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.683
With a director of nursing?

19:43.715 --> 19:46.182
- No, no, it's not uncommon...
- With a nurse manager?

19:46.217 --> 19:49.071
Look, we're always
short staffed.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.553
Did you bring this deficiency
to anyone's attention

19:52.587 --> 19:55.182
or do anything to
address the situation?

19:56.758 --> 19:58.332
It doesn't work like that.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.763
Mariko Shimane,
history of Crohn's Disease,

20:04.796 --> 20:06.063
vomited blood twice.

20:06.095 --> 20:07.243
Systolic's 88.

20:07.275 --> 20:09.472
Two liters of saline,
type and cross for four.

20:09.508 --> 20:11.012
Is there anyone we
can call, Mariko?

20:11.047 --> 20:13.451
- Dr. Derezin.
- From Gastroenterology, I paged him.

20:13.485 --> 20:14.691
How about a family member?

20:14.725 --> 20:16.090
It's just me and my son.

20:16.128 --> 20:17.843
- Where is he?
- Oregon.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.011
Sophomore in college.

20:19.047 --> 20:20.761
We can call him.
I'm sure he'd want to know.

20:20.795 --> 20:22.330
I'm in the hospital a lot.

20:22.366 --> 20:23.851
Your condition's
pretty serious.

20:23.888 --> 20:25.473
That's what they always say.

20:25.638 --> 20:27.153
Upper GI bleed?

20:27.187 --> 20:28.581
Sure looks like it.

20:28.615 --> 20:29.902
Hello, Mariko.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.381
Sorry to bother you, Neil.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.480
That's all right.
Any blood in your stool?

20:33.518 --> 20:34.463
Yeah.

20:34.498 --> 20:35.643
She'd didn't mention that.

20:35.676 --> 20:37.082
Red blood?

20:37.168 --> 20:38.310
Yeah.

20:38.385 --> 20:40.332
Endoscopy here or
in the GI lab?

20:40.368 --> 20:42.003
Excuse us for a minute.

20:44.718 --> 20:47.500
Dr. Pratt,
dude on line two says he's your brother.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.660
Yeah, take a message.

20:48.696 --> 20:51.123
And hey, Doc Lockhart, big daddy
called while you were upstairs.

20:51.158 --> 20:51.853
Thanks.

20:51.885 --> 20:53.133
I can't scope her.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.020
Why not?

20:54.058 --> 20:56.603
Crohn's can cause inflammation,
erosion into a vessel

20:56.635 --> 20:58.201
anywhere along the
intestinal tract.

20:58.236 --> 21:00.910
- 25 feet of possibilities.
- It's not something I can reach.

21:00.945 --> 21:02.601
She needs surgical exploration.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.761
I'll call the O.R.

21:03.798 --> 21:06.143
So... what's the good news?

21:06.175 --> 21:08.133
We're going to have to
put you in another room.

21:08.168 --> 21:09.921
Looks like you may
need an operation.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.053
Again?

21:11.087 --> 21:12.690
Maybe it's time
to call your son?

21:12.727 --> 21:14.753
He's got mid-terms, no.

21:14.817 --> 21:17.333
On the afternoon of
his third hospital day

21:17.368 --> 21:21.053
Mr. Ames complained of
numbness in the left hand.

21:21.085 --> 21:23.441
And what was your impression?

21:23.945 --> 21:25.461
How long did it last?

21:25.656 --> 21:27.220
About ten minutes.

21:28.676 --> 21:30.493
Okay, squeeze my hands.

21:33.307 --> 21:34.112
Okay.

21:34.148 --> 21:36.531
Now spread your
fingers like this.

21:36.825 --> 21:38.232
Don't let me close them.

21:39.235 --> 21:40.360
Good.

21:42.476 --> 21:45.180
- What do you think happened?
- It could be a number of things.

21:45.225 --> 21:47.760
How's it feel now?
Back to normal?

21:48.367 --> 21:51.381
Yeah, yeah... Yeah, I guess.

21:52.406 --> 21:54.182
The same on both sides?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.660
It was kind of weird.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.000
You probably compressed a nerve

21:59.035 --> 22:00.821
while you were
resting on your side.

22:01.667 --> 22:05.200
I've slept on floors more
comfortable than this-this bed.

22:06.126 --> 22:07.753
Here, let me take care of that.

22:13.626 --> 22:16.883
Hi, bed control.
Yeah, this is Dr. Kovac.

22:16.918 --> 22:20.752
Yeah, I need, I need a med surge
bed for my patient, please.

22:20.785 --> 22:23.583
And when did the
numbness return?

22:24.268 --> 22:26.542
It was about three hours later.

22:26.677 --> 22:29.570
And was there something
different about this episode?

22:29.605 --> 22:31.423
I didn't have any feeling
for a half an hour.

22:31.456 --> 22:32.850
But you're okay now?

22:32.906 --> 22:35.121
It's worse. Went up higher.

22:35.356 --> 22:36.640
Where's Dr. Kovac?

22:36.677 --> 22:38.412
He checked,
he said you were okay.

22:38.447 --> 22:40.321
I'm not okay.
I need to talk to him.

22:40.355 --> 22:41.572
Not right now.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.163
Why? Where is he?

22:43.196 --> 22:45.442
He's taking care of a
patient with a heart attack.

22:47.326 --> 22:48.881
Tell him to come and see me.

22:48.916 --> 22:49.963
When he's through.

22:49.998 --> 22:51.190
No, no, now.

22:51.227 --> 22:53.581
Mr. Ames, there are people in this E.R.
who are much sicker

22:53.598 --> 22:55.031
and need immediate attention.

22:55.976 --> 22:56.891
Hey.

22:56.926 --> 22:58.512
If he won't come to see me,
then I'm gonna...

22:58.548 --> 23:00.512
- ...go see him.
- Hey! Get back in the bed.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.753
Something is seriously wrong,
and I need to talk to my doctor.

23:02.787 --> 23:05.031
I need you back on the monitor.
Frank, help me get him back.

23:05.066 --> 23:06.610
Take it easy there, fella.
Take it easy.

23:06.646 --> 23:09.460
Take it easy?! You people have
ignored me for three days.

23:09.497 --> 23:11.053
No one will tell me
what's going on.

23:11.087 --> 23:13.602
Nobody gives a damn about my care!
No one will even talk to me!

23:13.616 --> 23:15.320
- How am I supposed to take it easy?!
- Mr. Ames, sit down.

23:15.356 --> 23:18.922
I'm not sitting down until my doctor
does what he's supposed to do!

23:22.555 --> 23:24.290
I need some help here!

23:24.927 --> 23:26.010
Open your eyes, sir.

23:26.047 --> 23:27.741
Hey, let's get a
gurney over here!

23:27.776 --> 23:28.943
Mr. Ames?

23:29.437 --> 23:30.542
Look at me.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.842
Luka, he had a stroke.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.142
Upgoing toe.

23:36.286 --> 23:37.803
CT can take him now.

23:37.836 --> 23:39.333
Okay, we're on our way.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.540
Let's go.

23:40.577 --> 23:43.952
We recognized the stroke, immediately
moved him for close monitoring

23:43.985 --> 23:46.172
and had him to CT as
soon as possible.

23:46.208 --> 23:49.311
From what I remember, it was...
it was pretty chaotic.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.450
Why should this
guy have a stroke?

23:50.486 --> 23:52.700
I have no idea.
Follow my finger, sir.

23:52.736 --> 23:55.153
Sir, look over here. Over here.

23:55.187 --> 23:57.423
- Frank, I need a monitored bed.
- There aren't any.

23:57.455 --> 24:00.951
- Uh, okay, uh, Trauma Two, then.
- GSW just took it.

24:00.987 --> 24:03.573
- Let's move him to CT.
- CT's backed up for half an hour.

24:03.606 --> 24:06.131
- Okay, where can we put him?!
- I'll see what I can find.

24:06.167 --> 24:08.241
Okay, uh, chart.
I need his chart.

24:08.476 --> 24:11.003
- Chuny, where's the chart?
- I never saw it.

24:11.597 --> 24:13.403
It's okay, Mariko,
just take some deep breaths.

24:13.437 --> 24:15.320
- Where the hell's surgery?
- Crenshaw called, said the patient's

24:15.358 --> 24:18.010
not a candidate for anesthesia
till the systolic's up to 80.

24:18.046 --> 24:19.353
All right, well,
let's tank her up.

24:19.386 --> 24:21.103
Eight French cordis
into the femoral.

24:21.136 --> 24:22.881
You know, I had another idea.

24:22.958 --> 24:24.132
Oh, man.

24:24.168 --> 24:25.990
Hey, has anyone seen
a pocket doppler?

24:26.027 --> 24:28.101
Uh, yeah,
top drawer by the sink.

24:28.185 --> 24:30.143
What about an
intra-aortic balloon?

24:30.178 --> 24:31.412
This girl in heart failure?

24:31.448 --> 24:33.161
No, it's a GI bleed.

24:33.326 --> 24:35.493
What? We inflate the
balloon in the chest,

24:35.525 --> 24:37.741
completely block off the
blood supply to the abdomen.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.193
No, you can't do that.

24:39.228 --> 24:39.942
Damn it.

24:39.975 --> 24:41.053
Why not? That's a great idea.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.963
Hey, she's not your patient.
Adios, Gates.

24:42.997 --> 24:44.651
Okay, could be a
publishable case report.

24:44.686 --> 24:46.863
It's a non-invasive way
to occlude the aorta.

24:46.898 --> 24:48.021
It'll stop the bleeding.

24:48.057 --> 24:50.561
Oh, crap, crap. Crap.

24:50.597 --> 24:51.663
What?

24:51.696 --> 24:53.312
Pratt, can you come with me?

24:55.508 --> 24:59.652
Four units of red cells, one of FFP, a
ten-pack of platelets. We'll be right back.

25:00.647 --> 25:03.442
Hey, hey, hey. What is this,
some kind of postpartum power trip?

25:03.476 --> 25:05.271
Okay, the aortic
balloon will work.

25:05.306 --> 25:06.792
It's an unproven therapy.

25:06.826 --> 25:08.262
What, you'd rather let
her bleed to death?

25:08.297 --> 25:10.260
No, I'd rather have the surgeons
take her up to the O.R.

25:10.297 --> 25:11.493
It doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

25:11.527 --> 25:12.861
And what's your problem
with the balloon?

25:12.897 --> 25:16.331
Because it cuts off all the circulation
to the bowel, liver, kidneys and legs.

25:16.367 --> 25:18.303
Everything could die
from the chest down.

25:18.337 --> 25:19.581
What are we doing in here?

25:19.618 --> 25:21.831
You know,
you used to be such a cowboy.

25:21.867 --> 25:23.010
Why is this a big deal?

25:23.046 --> 25:24.331
I don't agree with you.

25:24.367 --> 25:25.741
Gates thinks it'll work.

25:26.106 --> 25:28.842
Gates is a knucklehead who would
defibrillate with a car battery

25:28.878 --> 25:30.152
and some jumper cables.

25:30.185 --> 25:32.240
I am the attending.
The buck stops here.

25:32.276 --> 25:33.903
So if there's going
to be a bad outcome,

25:33.937 --> 25:36.242
let surgery be to blame
for not showing up in time.

25:36.278 --> 25:37.601
So you let her die?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.793
No, I just don't want to
be the guy who kills her

25:39.828 --> 25:41.492
with some crazy-ass therapy.

25:41.528 --> 25:43.570
Look. This is her last chance.

25:43.607 --> 25:44.771
She's pre-arrest.

25:44.807 --> 25:47.911
If her pressure continues to drop
despite massive transfusions...

25:47.945 --> 25:49.702
Then maybe I would consider it.
What are you doing?

25:49.736 --> 25:53.151
I'm pumping. Sorry.
My boobs were about to explode.

26:02.175 --> 26:03.971
When did your wife arrive?

26:04.366 --> 26:06.100
Right after the CAT scan.

26:06.707 --> 26:08.972
By then I could talk again,
you know.

26:09.008 --> 26:10.303
It looks okay.

26:11.776 --> 26:15.811
I... still can't move my arm...

26:15.847 --> 26:17.110
and leg.

26:17.148 --> 26:19.170
There's no mass, no bleeding.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.752
That's... that's good.

26:20.937 --> 26:23.023
Then why did he have a stroke?

26:23.308 --> 26:25.902
Probably a blood clot
in the brain artery.

26:26.427 --> 26:31.003
But, uh...
there is something we can try.

26:31.046 --> 26:32.181
What?

26:32.716 --> 26:34.291
What should I do?

26:34.825 --> 26:39.683
A medicine called TPA could
probably dissolve the clot.

26:41.055 --> 26:44.652
You're saying that could work?

26:44.838 --> 26:48.442
That I might...
I can get better, right?

26:48.477 --> 26:53.980
There's some chance of
recovery 30% of the time.

26:54.015 --> 26:58.131
And... full recovery,
ten percent of the time.

27:01.938 --> 27:03.573
We've got to do something.

27:06.765 --> 27:09.243
What about the si...
side effects?

27:10.477 --> 27:12.623
There's always side effects.

27:13.108 --> 27:18.012
Well, there's a ten percent
chance of bleeding in the brain,

27:18.048 --> 27:19.662
causing more
disability and death.

27:19.695 --> 27:22.953
Ten percent chance
of recovery?!

27:23.227 --> 27:26.753
There's a ten percent
chance of-of death?

27:26.936 --> 27:29.732
What if we don't use the drug?

27:31.128 --> 27:34.162
There can be some improvement

27:34.437 --> 27:36.401
with time and physical therapy,

27:36.437 --> 27:39.172
but probably not full recovery.

27:45.008 --> 27:51.193
Look... I...
I've been in this hospital

27:51.277 --> 27:57.100
long enough to know that if
something can go wrong, it...

27:59.326 --> 28:02.602
I don't want it.

28:04.356 --> 28:07.283
And what do you recall of Mr.
Ames' reaction

28:07.317 --> 28:09.520
to your recommendation of TPA?

28:09.748 --> 28:12.201
I brought in Dr.
Saunders, a neurologist,

28:12.238 --> 28:15.361
to try to explain options
in an objective manner.

28:15.398 --> 28:18.073
The statistics are
averages for all patients,

28:18.108 --> 28:20.350
even ones in their 70s and 80s.

28:20.388 --> 28:22.981
Your risk of bleeding is much less,
given your age

28:23.017 --> 28:27.122
and the fact that it's been only 90
minutes since the onset of symptoms.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.112
I don't... I don't know.

28:31.907 --> 28:35.243
The TPA is your only shot
at complete recovery.

28:39.045 --> 28:40.083
Forget it.

28:40.115 --> 28:42.020
I'm-I'm not taking it.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.252
Settle down, baby.

28:43.287 --> 28:45.423
Look, if it was me,

28:45.455 --> 28:48.052
I'd-I'd take the TPA.

28:48.088 --> 28:49.673
If it was you,

28:49.706 --> 28:52.873
if it was you,
you'd be in intensive care with-with-

28:52.905 --> 28:57.952
ten doctors and nurses watching your
ass every second, day and night.

28:58.577 --> 29:00.762
You wouldn't be getting the
runaround for three days.

29:00.797 --> 29:03.221
Not sleeping, not eating.

29:04.546 --> 29:07.481
Pissing in a pan.
And now I'm supposed to trust you

29:07.518 --> 29:10.472
with a medicine
that can kill me,

29:10.507 --> 29:13.390
when all I've seen
since I've been here

29:13.428 --> 29:16.400
is total incompetence!

29:18.136 --> 29:20.671
Mr. Ames,
did you refuse a therapy

29:20.707 --> 29:23.930
that had the potential
to reverse the stroke?

29:25.305 --> 29:27.002
There were no guarantees.

29:27.038 --> 29:30.560
Experts have agreed that
TPA gave you the only chance

29:30.596 --> 29:32.103
for a complete recovery.

29:32.416 --> 29:35.131
And you didn't want it?

29:36.855 --> 29:39.821
It was a lot more complicated
than that, really.

29:39.855 --> 29:43.383
Did you refuse a medicine
that could've cured you?

29:49.628 --> 29:52.410
I refused what
they were pushing,

29:52.505 --> 29:54.020
and you would've
done the same thing.

29:54.058 --> 29:57.071
So you did refuse the cure?

30:00.137 --> 30:02.022
Systolic's only 50
after four unites.

30:02.058 --> 30:03.930
All right,
hang another two units.

30:04.655 --> 30:06.740
I'm above the diaphragm.
Go ahead, inject.

30:06.778 --> 30:09.952
I'm putting in 40ccs of saline.
Let's hope this damn thing works.

30:09.987 --> 30:11.480
Doc Lock, you got a call.

30:11.516 --> 30:12.690
Kind of busy right now.

30:12.725 --> 30:14.850
- Balloon is up.
- It's your baby-sitter.

30:14.886 --> 30:16.533
They said it was important.

30:16.598 --> 30:17.770
Pressure's up to 90.

30:17.808 --> 30:19.453
All right, go ahead,
go, take it.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.642
We're out of the woods.
Mark the time.

30:21.777 --> 30:25.062
Surgeons have one hour to get it up
and fix her, or the game is over.

30:25.098 --> 30:27.022
- Hello.
- They should be here any minute.

30:27.057 --> 30:28.290
What's happening?

30:28.328 --> 30:29.873
Well, we've got your
bleeding controlled...

30:29.905 --> 30:31.223
Is he hungry?

30:31.258 --> 30:32.993
Did you try the stroller?

30:33.595 --> 30:34.770
Thanks for joining us.

30:34.805 --> 30:37.230
What's up with the fluoro?
I thought E.R. docs had X-ray vision.

30:37.265 --> 30:40.371
Okay, okay.
Put the phone next to his ear.

30:40.407 --> 30:42.531
...a Crohn's patient from
intra-abdominal exsanguination.

30:42.565 --> 30:44.721
Rather unconventional,
dare I say, idiotic.

30:44.758 --> 30:45.832
Well, it worked.

30:45.868 --> 30:48.711
# If I go,
there will be trouble #

30:48.745 --> 30:50.012
...without the thoracacotomy.
It's very cool.

30:50.046 --> 30:52.230
What's not cool is that her kidneys
will be dead within an hour.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.960
- Let's go, clock is ticking.
- Abby?

30:53.997 --> 30:55.901
It's his favorite song,
it puts him right to sleep.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.401
# This indecision's
bugging me #

30:58.437 --> 30:59.540
Aren't you glad you
don't work here anymore?

30:59.575 --> 31:01.500
She's auditioning
for American Idol.

31:01.538 --> 31:03.542
# If you don't want me,
set me free #

31:03.576 --> 31:05.753
- Hey, nice work, Abby.
- Thanks.

31:05.787 --> 31:09.110
# Exactly whom I'm
supposed to be? #

31:09.636 --> 31:12.641
# Don't you know which
clothes even fit me? #

31:12.677 --> 31:18.080
Upstairs, the neurologists recognized
a faint mid-systolic murmur.

31:18.406 --> 31:19.842
What does that mean?

31:20.108 --> 31:23.533
A murmur is from turbulent
blood flow through the heart.

31:23.566 --> 31:26.081
So because of the murmur,
a cardiac echo was ordered

31:26.115 --> 31:28.231
showing a patent foramen ovale.

31:28.267 --> 31:31.193
Do you know what a patent
foramen ovale is, Dr. Kovac?

31:31.227 --> 31:33.423
A small hole between the
upper chambers of the heart.

31:33.456 --> 31:37.083
So that hole could have
allowed a blood clot

31:37.117 --> 31:39.682
from your subclavian
catheter to pass

31:39.715 --> 31:43.283
from the right side to
the left side of the heart

31:43.318 --> 31:47.183
and then... up to the brain.

31:47.597 --> 31:50.193
Could happen.
But that's extremely rare.

31:50.228 --> 31:52.192
I didn't ask you how rare it was,
Dr. Kovac.

31:52.228 --> 31:55.262
I asked you whether a patent foramen
provides a pathway for a clot

31:55.298 --> 31:57.552
to travel to the brain
and cause a stroke.

31:58.276 --> 31:59.310
Yes.

31:59.345 --> 32:02.000
So if you had heard the murmur,
if you had pulled the catheter

32:02.038 --> 32:03.841
when the numbness began,
is it possible

32:03.875 --> 32:06.263
that you could have prevented Mr.
Ames' stroke?

32:06.298 --> 32:07.302
Objection.

32:07.337 --> 32:08.793
Calls for speculation.

32:08.828 --> 32:10.140
Sustained.

32:10.585 --> 32:13.993
When the numbness began,
did you consider a cardiac source,

32:14.027 --> 32:16.513
or did you ignore an
important warning sign

32:16.548 --> 32:17.980
of impending stroke?

32:18.015 --> 32:20.793
I didn't ignore anything.
I considered what was probable

32:20.828 --> 32:22.183
and acted accordingly.

32:22.217 --> 32:24.680
After Mr.
Ames complained of numbness,

32:24.717 --> 32:27.263
did you then appreciate
his heart murmur?

32:27.295 --> 32:30.953
The E.R. is a noisy place.
You can't always hear subtle murmurs.

32:30.986 --> 32:34.623
Dr. Kovac, I'm not asking you
about the noise level in your E.R.

32:34.656 --> 32:38.110
I'm asking did you at any
time in the three days

32:38.146 --> 32:41.512
that you cared for Mr.
Ames recognize his heart murmur?

32:41.548 --> 32:43.420
At the time of Mr.
Ames' numbness,

32:43.458 --> 32:45.530
there were 47
patients in the E.R.,

32:45.567 --> 32:47.541
82 in the waiting room.

32:47.578 --> 32:50.701
I was taking care of a young mother who
was the victim of domestic violence,

32:50.738 --> 32:53.722
nearly beaten to death,
an eight-year-old, hit by a car...

32:53.758 --> 32:55.411
and a 53-year-old
heart attack victim...

32:55.446 --> 32:57.301
Dr. Kovac,
you're not answering my question.

32:57.335 --> 33:00.591
I asked if he had a heart murmur
that you failed to recognize.

33:00.626 --> 33:02.701
It was reasonable to believe that Mr.
Ames' numbness could wait!

33:02.735 --> 33:03.903
Order!

33:03.958 --> 33:05.913
Only one of you can
speak at a time.

33:05.947 --> 33:07.640
Your Honor,
I move to strike that that entire tirade

33:07.676 --> 33:09.471
be stricken from the
record as non-responsive,

33:09.508 --> 33:12.663
and I request that the court admonish
the witness to answer my question.

33:12.697 --> 33:13.841
Restate the question.

33:13.875 --> 33:16.053
And, Doctor,
I'm instructing you to answer it.

33:16.087 --> 33:18.230
If you had heard the murmur,

33:18.268 --> 33:21.262
is it possible that you could
have prevented the stroke?

33:21.297 --> 33:22.511
Objection.

33:22.545 --> 33:24.550
Possibility is not the issue.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.172
- Sustained.
- Dr. Kovac,

33:26.207 --> 33:29.922
is it true that you could
have prevented the stroke?

33:32.957 --> 33:36.103
- Well, Doctor?
- Counselor, I'm warning you.

33:36.137 --> 33:38.530
No need;
I'm done with this witness.

33:41.265 --> 33:44.021
... this family went home,
and lost rectal thermometer

33:44.056 --> 33:45.370
went up to surgery.

33:45.406 --> 33:47.491
Gates needs you for an
extubation in Trauma Two.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.273
All right.

33:48.307 --> 33:50.390
I'm here till 7:00,
so call me if you get a break.

33:50.425 --> 33:51.692
Hey, any news from Kovac?

33:51.726 --> 33:53.271
- Not yet.
- Greg?

33:53.306 --> 33:54.521
Hey.

33:55.968 --> 33:57.311
- Am I too early?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:57.347 --> 34:00.083
Just have a seat in Triage for a
few minutes. I'll be right back.

34:00.597 --> 34:02.830
- It's Abby, right?
- Yes.

34:02.867 --> 34:04.620
Oh, hi. Sorry about your arms.

34:04.655 --> 34:06.983
It's okay;
they fixed me up pretty good,

34:07.016 --> 34:09.402
but the med school wants me to
make a chart for their insurance.

34:09.437 --> 34:10.842
It's no problem, I got it.

34:11.438 --> 34:12.743
Thank you, Ray.

34:12.777 --> 34:13.972
Thanks, Ray.

34:15.398 --> 34:17.170
I guess we can do
it in Curtain Four.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.272
Great.

34:18.496 --> 34:20.033
You might need a
little debridement.

34:20.068 --> 34:21.389
Go for it.

34:21.536 --> 34:23.241
So, your shift almost over?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.420
They're giving me
two days off to heal.

34:26.456 --> 34:28.331
Well, that's very
generous of the surgeons.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.013
First free night in forever.

34:32.136 --> 34:33.911
Have you been to Rednofive?

34:34.596 --> 34:35.889
Uh, no.

34:36.594 --> 34:40.232
They remodeled, and I hear the DJ
on Thursday nights is ridiculous.

34:42.356 --> 34:44.072
You want to check
it out tonight?

34:46.554 --> 34:50.471
Both emergency and infectious
disease experts agree

34:50.505 --> 34:53.480
that Dr.
Kovac gave superior treatment,

34:53.518 --> 34:56.643
above and beyond the
standard of care.

35:00.326 --> 35:04.921
The stroke was a
one-in-a-million complication

35:04.956 --> 35:08.911
that no one could have either
predicted or prevented.

35:10.637 --> 35:16.090
Dr. Kovac treats the patients
that no other doctor will treat.

35:16.327 --> 35:21.093
His E.R. is the safety net for
millions with no health insurance.

35:21.127 --> 35:24.140
Every day,
he is out there on the front lines,

35:24.177 --> 35:27.251
providing the best
health care possible

35:27.286 --> 35:30.212
for the people who
need it the most.

35:30.245 --> 35:32.592
If you find against Dr. Kovac,

35:33.375 --> 35:37.393
what message do you send to other
health care providers like him,

35:37.426 --> 35:40.662
who make that daily struggle
their personal mission?

35:40.898 --> 35:44.443
Dr. Kovac could have sent Mr.
Ames home

35:44.475 --> 35:46.411
with antibiotic pills,

35:46.445 --> 35:47.770
but he didn't.

35:47.808 --> 35:50.441
He assumed that Mr.
Ames was unreliable,

35:50.476 --> 35:52.120
that he couldn't be trusted.

35:52.467 --> 35:56.721
And so Dr.
Kovac took responsibility for his care.

35:56.896 --> 36:00.481
And then, he abandoned that
responsibility by subjecting Mr. Ames

36:00.517 --> 36:03.520
to substandard conditions
in an understaffed E.R.,

36:03.556 --> 36:07.042
where that man was shoved
into a corner and neglected.

36:07.077 --> 36:10.783
And the warning signs of a
major stroke were ignored,

36:10.945 --> 36:13.660
resulting in a
devastating disability.

36:14.296 --> 36:15.921
Before the stroke,

36:15.976 --> 36:18.523
Mr. Ames was a
skilled craftsman.

36:18.556 --> 36:21.192
He supported a wife
and two children.

36:21.227 --> 36:23.572
And now,
with a paralyzed left arm,

36:23.607 --> 36:26.122
loss of perception in
his left visual field,

36:26.156 --> 36:29.212
that livelihood has
been taken away.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.193
Loss of income,

36:32.246 --> 36:34.150
loss of self-esteem

36:34.187 --> 36:36.602
has resulted in profound stress

36:36.876 --> 36:38.541
and led to a divorce

36:38.575 --> 36:40.791
and separation
from his children.

36:41.158 --> 36:43.353
Mr. Ames now lives alone.

36:43.717 --> 36:48.023
He's trying to get by on a disability
benefit of $1,300 a month.

36:48.055 --> 36:52.252
He cannot drive,
he sees his children one day a week,

36:52.307 --> 36:54.742
and he is being
treated for depression.

36:55.535 --> 36:59.141
Your award must fairly
compensate Mr. Ames

36:59.177 --> 37:01.503
for past and ongoing
medical care,

37:01.537 --> 37:04.750
for 25 years of lost wages,

37:04.786 --> 37:08.922
and for the pain and suffering that
this man will experience every day

37:08.955 --> 37:10.673
for the rest of his life.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.982
And you want to make sure that
this part rests against your ribcage,

37:16.017 --> 37:17.372
not your armpits.

37:17.408 --> 37:19.132
And then, you just-- whoops!

37:19.758 --> 37:21.851
I'm okay. I'm okay.

37:21.886 --> 37:23.492
- You sure those things are safe?
- Yeah.

37:23.526 --> 37:26.203
I think they just need
an adjustment, or...

37:26.438 --> 37:28.610
you can go to the pharmacy
and get a new pair.

37:28.646 --> 37:30.100
Good idea.

37:30.407 --> 37:31.651
Be careful.

37:34.225 --> 37:36.113
Should we sign you in
as a trauma patient?

37:36.148 --> 37:38.213
I would say yes,
but my shift is over.

37:38.248 --> 37:40.031
Call me if your
spleen ruptures.

37:41.188 --> 37:43.430
Excuse me. Hi.
Is Dr. Pratt around?

37:43.468 --> 37:45.081
He's with a patient--
can I help you?

37:45.277 --> 37:47.270
He told me he was
going to be right back.

37:47.336 --> 37:49.373
If you see him, will you let him
know that Chaz is still waiting?

37:49.405 --> 37:50.423
Okay.

37:50.527 --> 37:51.993
Hey, Neela, you have a minute?

37:52.028 --> 37:53.803
I have 12 hours;
I'm on all night.

37:53.835 --> 37:55.390
Okay, it's about Katey,
your med student.

37:55.428 --> 37:56.800
- Ray...
- Hey, hey.

37:56.837 --> 37:58.121
She asked me out, all right?

37:58.156 --> 38:00.253
You know that residents are not
allowed to date their students.

38:00.287 --> 38:01.823
She's not my student,
she never will be.

38:01.857 --> 38:04.612
She's not doing an E.R. elective, so
technically, it's not even against policy.

38:04.645 --> 38:05.992
Well, then why even ask?

38:06.887 --> 38:09.103
Thanks, appreciate your help.

38:10.196 --> 38:12.113
I'm sorry, I got to go.

38:12.508 --> 38:14.390
- Tell Greg I'll call him.
- Okay.

38:14.427 --> 38:15.623
- Hey, Mayday.
- Hello.

38:15.655 --> 38:16.621
What are you doing here?

38:16.655 --> 38:18.921
- Small bowel obstruction.
- Good times.

38:18.957 --> 38:20.770
So, uh,
how's the guy who went up in flames?

38:20.807 --> 38:23.142
Minor partial thickness burns
to the chest and abdomen.

38:23.177 --> 38:25.512
You know,
I hear his aorta was just fine.

38:25.797 --> 38:28.222
You know, there's a lesson to
be learned here. Wise men say,

38:28.256 --> 38:31.021
- "Only fools rush in."
- You missed a guy called Chaz.

38:31.056 --> 38:32.320
He left?

38:32.906 --> 38:34.441
You were saying?

38:37.217 --> 38:39.423
Hey, Chaz, Chaz, hold up, man.

38:39.476 --> 38:41.720
Sorry about that;
I got caught up with a patient.

38:41.755 --> 38:43.923
It's okay. I got to go.

38:43.958 --> 38:46.081
No, come on, man.
It sounded like something serious.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.493
Nah, it's all good.

38:47.528 --> 38:48.630
Hey.

38:50.776 --> 38:53.011
Things just aren't
going so well at home.

38:53.577 --> 38:54.770
Really?

38:55.145 --> 38:57.193
When I want to study,
it's too noisy.

38:57.228 --> 38:59.763
When I want to bring my friends over,
Dad won't let me.

38:59.798 --> 39:02.260
I'm always late to class,
because the commute takes forever.

39:02.295 --> 39:03.861
What about the dorm?

39:03.928 --> 39:05.513
Costs too much.

39:05.597 --> 39:08.260
When you saw me out there earlier,
I was looking for apartments to share,

39:08.297 --> 39:11.081
but... they all kind of sucked.

39:11.775 --> 39:15.272
Look, I know this is going
to sound crazy, but...

39:16.016 --> 39:19.430
I was thinking maybe I
could move into your place.

39:21.188 --> 39:23.642
- My place?
- Yeah, your place.

39:23.676 --> 39:25.973
I mean, it's close to campus.

39:26.007 --> 39:28.721
I can get a part-time job,
to help you out with the rent.

39:28.758 --> 39:30.093
I'm quiet.

39:30.128 --> 39:32.032
We'll probably never
even see each other.

39:32.068 --> 39:33.472
You're serious?

39:35.677 --> 39:38.832
Chaz, come on, man.
You know, I got my own style.

39:38.868 --> 39:40.533
Aw, come on.

39:40.567 --> 39:43.041
You say the word,
and I'm gonna clear out for you.

39:44.087 --> 39:47.693
And if it doesn't work, I'll...
I'll be gone...

39:48.186 --> 39:49.792
real fast, man.

39:54.578 --> 39:56.883
Never mind; it's a bad idea.

39:56.918 --> 39:58.702
All right, look.

40:00.367 --> 40:02.380
Let's try it for a month.

40:03.157 --> 40:04.653
You for real?

40:05.378 --> 40:07.461
Yeah, I'll talk to your mom.

40:08.185 --> 40:10.411
Thank you. Thank you.

40:11.748 --> 40:14.322
- I'm going to holler at you.
- All right, man, take it easy.

40:18.635 --> 40:19.632
Hey!

40:20.517 --> 40:22.673
So, how was the first day back?

40:22.707 --> 40:24.040
It was a piece of cake.

40:24.435 --> 40:26.380
- Like riding a bike.
- Yeah?

40:26.417 --> 40:27.320
You miss your little man?

40:27.357 --> 40:29.322
Yeah, but that's okay.

40:29.356 --> 40:31.632
I'll bond with him again
when I feed him at 11:00

40:31.667 --> 40:33.560
and 2:00 and 5:00 a.m.

40:34.238 --> 40:36.320
But you know what
was nice about today?

40:36.357 --> 40:39.983
For 12 hours,
I talked like a grown-up to grown-ups.

40:40.018 --> 40:42.591
Well, except for when you had
to deal with the surgeons.

40:42.627 --> 40:44.863
Yeah, but at least they
don't spit up on you.

40:44.905 --> 40:45.953
Much.

40:46.895 --> 40:48.202
Good night.

40:48.536 --> 40:49.990
Try to get some rest.

40:50.027 --> 40:51.420
It's a nice idea.

40:53.908 --> 40:55.732
How long do you think
they'll deliberate?

40:55.768 --> 40:57.801
Shouldn't take more
than a day or two.

40:58.436 --> 41:00.943
Ames' lawyer is a
publicity hound.

41:01.195 --> 41:04.423
Local news is having a
field day trashing County.

41:05.018 --> 41:07.051
It'll be good to get you
in front of the press

41:07.087 --> 41:09.323
as "the doctor
found not guilty."

41:09.358 --> 41:10.933
Well, you're very optimistic.

41:10.977 --> 41:13.370
People need to hear
our side of the story

41:13.406 --> 41:16.523
to reassure them that the
county health system works.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.720
During that videotape,

41:19.767 --> 41:22.430
did you see the looks
on the jurors' faces?

41:23.115 --> 41:26.650
Doctors get sued for ignoring
and undertreating patients,

41:26.686 --> 41:29.110
not for doing too much.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.800
Plus, you did a great
job on the stand.

41:31.838 --> 41:33.492
Well, I don't think so.

41:34.777 --> 41:37.233
I've been to at least
a hundred trials.

41:37.267 --> 41:40.281
I can tell when a jury
likes the doctor.

41:42.368 --> 41:46.083
He's just another greedy M.D.
getting rich by overtreating.

41:46.118 --> 41:47.230
What are you talking about?

41:47.265 --> 41:48.741
I've read about it.

41:48.775 --> 41:51.303
The drug companies give
kickbacks to doctors

41:51.336 --> 41:53.603
who use their expensive drugs.

41:53.638 --> 41:56.422
The judge instructed us not to
decide this case based on anything

41:56.458 --> 41:58.193
we've heard outside
of the courtroom.

41:58.228 --> 42:01.373
They neglected this
guy for three days.

42:01.577 --> 42:03.421
His pneumonia was improving.

42:03.457 --> 42:06.471
That doctor used a hand
grenade to kill a mosquito.

42:06.506 --> 42:08.893
To me,
that's bad medical judgment.

42:09.155 --> 42:11.812
You're not a doctor.
We've got to to decide this thing

42:11.846 --> 42:14.943
based on the expert witness
definition of the standard of care.

42:14.976 --> 42:17.121
Well, when you're talking
about County General,

42:17.155 --> 42:19.661
the term "standard
of care" is a joke.

42:19.696 --> 42:22.531
That's right;
Kovac is part of the system.

42:22.568 --> 42:25.112
We all know the system sucks.

42:31.267 --> 42:36.333
