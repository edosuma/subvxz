05:06.208 --> 05:07.999
Strumpet.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.499
You're a lifesaver,
you know that, Belle?

05:32.750 --> 05:33.624
Thanks.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.249
Deanna wants to talk to you.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.582
What makes you say that, Belle?

05:42.833 --> 05:45.415
She just was telling me...
- If Deanna wants to talk to me,

05:45.666 --> 05:47.165
she'll come and talk to me.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.499
I'll take one of those burgers
when those burgers are ready.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.624
Are these burgers ready yet, Belle?
- I don't...

05:54.208 --> 05:56.790
I'll check.
- Good.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.624
Hey, keep an eye on Darlin'.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.332
She's after that Clapp boy again.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.999
Deanna.
- Chris.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.832
So, what's on your mind, sweetheart?

06:18.583 --> 06:21.249
I told you! No more kissing.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.499
It is inappropriate.
Do you hear me?

06:23.750 --> 06:26.124
Yeah, I hear you,
you're yelling in my ear.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.540
Can I have my radio back now?
- We'll see.

06:28.791 --> 06:31.290
What are you gonna do, jenny?
- Hold her. - Stop it!

06:31.541 --> 06:32.999
Are you gonna cry
to your Momma, like a baby?

06:33.250 --> 06:34.999
What's the matter, Jenny?
- You wearing diapers?

06:35.250 --> 06:36.290
Let's see it!

06:36.541 --> 06:37.915
Stop it! I'm gonna tell!

06:38.166 --> 06:39.624
Like a girl, you're gonna tell.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.249
You need your diaper changed, jenny.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.332
Ow!
- Shut up!

06:45.166 --> 06:47.332
Diapers? Diapers, Jenny?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.832
I spend as much time as I can
with Ed up at the home,

06:53.125 --> 06:55.290
but I'd like to spend more.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.124
That's understandable.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.499
So what I wanna do is...

06:59.750 --> 07:02.124
I wanna sell it all off,
get myself a nice little

07:02.375 --> 07:04.374
one-bedroom up around there,

07:04.625 --> 07:07.707
so I can be with him
these last few months.

07:08.041 --> 07:10.915
I don't think he's got
much more than that.

07:13.625 --> 07:15.124
Hey.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.999
If you really wanted to sell,
I'm glad you came to me.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.332
So you just come by
the office on Monday

07:25.208 --> 07:28.707
and we'll start drawing up
some papers. Okay?

07:28.958 --> 07:30.874
I can't give you
the world for the place

07:31.125 --> 07:33.249
but I'll give you a fair price.

07:33.541 --> 07:36.165
I know you will, Chris.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.665
It's the good thing
about old friends,

07:38.916 --> 07:42.249
you don't have to worry
about gettin' a lube job.

07:50.416 --> 07:53.582
How'd you do, bud?
- Eight out of ten, dad.

07:55.791 --> 07:57.415
Consistently?

07:58.125 --> 08:00.665
The last one and once before that.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.499
I think I got the hang of it, though.

08:05.791 --> 08:08.624
Gotta hit your free throws
to win ball games.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.082
I know.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.540
That guy's got a major thing for Peg.

08:13.791 --> 08:16.374
He's pretty much a douche.
They went out like one time.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.957
Is that so?

08:36.625 --> 08:37.874
Watch the leather.

08:40.582 --> 08:41.999
So you didn't go in once, huh?

08:42.250 --> 08:44.290
Chlorine makes my hair gross.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.290
We wouldn't want that,
now, would we?

09:29.916 --> 09:32.124
You feed the dogs yet?

09:32.416 --> 09:34.457
Brian'll do it when he gets up.

09:35.166 --> 09:36.915
The dogs can wait.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.749
It's kinda nice when
it's quiet like this, isn't it?

13:29.500 --> 13:32.374
How's the average?
- 7 - 10.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.832
Pretty consistent.
- Good. That's good.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.249
Did you catch anything?

13:39.750 --> 13:41.832
Does it look like I got anything?

13:43.583 --> 13:45.457
I should turn down the ham.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.290
Fine, you do that,

13:47.791 --> 13:49.999
then come along with me, babe.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.540
Me too?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.624
Sure, sweetie. You too.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.540
Follow us, son!

14:23.083 --> 14:25.040
Watch your step.

14:28.458 --> 14:29.790
Okay.

14:30.416 --> 14:34.332
I want you guys to move
all this junk from the south end

14:34.583 --> 14:37.457
to the other side of the cellar,
and just sweep up the floor.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.915
Before dinner?
- Yes, before dinner, Peg.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.249
Why?

14:42.500 --> 14:44.249
Because your dad asked you to.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.832
You don't have a problem with that,
do you Brian? - No.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.749
Where do you want us
to move all the stuff?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.124
In the dump trailer.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.124
If it's small and burnable,
put it in the burn barrel.

14:53.375 --> 14:56.749
You're gonna need some gloves.
There's a couple pair in the barn.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.874
Have you fed the dogs yet?
- It's Peggy's turn. I had morning.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.415
Peg?

15:01.666 --> 15:04.749
Fine. I'll feed the dogs.
I'll go get the gloves.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.165
Is there mice down here?

15:08.500 --> 15:09.499
Could be.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.749
Should I get some cheese?

15:12.083 --> 15:14.499
No, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.040
Belle, you organize
things around here.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.582
With three of you,
it shouldn't take very long.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.207
I've got some things
to do at the house.

15:22.916 --> 15:24.290
Chris?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.374
Why are we doing this?

15:28.916 --> 15:30.707
You'll see.

15:31.416 --> 15:33.040
Trust me on this one.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.874
What's he doing?

16:15.125 --> 16:17.457
Peggy, you scared
the hell out of me.

16:17.708 --> 16:20.207
Sorry. I couldn't sleep.

16:20.458 --> 16:23.290
Well, try. You have
school in the morning.

16:24.791 --> 16:26.499
What's dad doing?

16:29.666 --> 16:31.332
Go to bed, Peggy.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.582
It's late.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.290
Good night, mom.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.165
Good night, honey.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.582
Hey, I don't wanna hurt you!

17:41.291 --> 17:43.999
Okay, so who can tell me
what a scalene triangle is?

17:44.375 --> 17:46.790
Three unequal sides.
- That's right.

17:47.041 --> 17:49.499
But we forgot to raise our
hand again, didn't we, jackie?

17:50.125 --> 17:51.249
Sorry, Miss Raton.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.957
So what other kinds of triangles
are there? Name them for me, guys.

17:57.541 --> 17:58.624
Peggy?

17:58.875 --> 18:01.165
Taking copious notes as usual, right?

18:01.416 --> 18:02.665
Just some notes, yeah.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.665
So what other kinds
of triangles are there, Peg?

18:05.166 --> 18:06.249
Scalene?

18:07.541 --> 18:08.790
Guys.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.457
Please, may I be excused?

18:10.791 --> 18:12.624
Yes. Of course you may.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.915
You okay, sweetie?

18:47.166 --> 18:50.499
Yeah. I just had to come
and get my stuff.

18:53.541 --> 18:55.290
Sorry.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.457
Great shot, Cyndi!

19:06.916 --> 19:08.499
Way to go, Brian!

19:18.791 --> 19:19.790
You're too good.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.665
What's up, Cyndi?

20:12.916 --> 20:15.374
There's something sticky
like glue in my brush.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.207
Let me see.

20:18.000 --> 20:18.999
Gum.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.624
It's okay Cyndi. I'll help you.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.249
Ow! That hurts!
- Sorry.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.207
It's okay. Thanks for trying.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.374
Dammit!

22:08.916 --> 22:09.999
Fuck!

22:57.791 --> 23:01.040
That is not civilized behavior!

23:05.250 --> 23:06.457
Fuck!

23:08.416 --> 23:09.290
Dammit!

23:13.625 --> 23:14.624
Fuck!

23:34.291 --> 23:35.874
Oh, God!

24:11.166 --> 24:12.165
So...

24:13.000 --> 24:14.665
you like to bite.

24:17.916 --> 24:21.082
You can't understand
a word I'm saying.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.790
I get that.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.165
But I'll bet that you could guess...

24:27.833 --> 24:31.165
that I am more than just a little bit
upset with you right now.

24:32.833 --> 24:34.457
So I need to make sure

24:34.708 --> 24:38.082
that you understand
just who is in charge here.

24:53.416 --> 24:55.832
I've got kids to raise
around here, lady.

24:57.958 --> 25:02.540
And disobedience is not something
I want them to witness.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.207
They're very good kids,

25:11.333 --> 25:15.790
and I would very much like
to introduce them to you.

25:16.041 --> 25:17.540
But...

25:18.041 --> 25:20.415
if you're not going to be nice,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.957
if you are going
to be disobedient,

25:29.958 --> 25:32.082
then I can't do that.

25:32.458 --> 25:33.790
Now can I?

25:37.625 --> 25:40.540
Plus, I need to feel better
about losing my finger.

25:57.125 --> 25:59.165
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the house for a minute.

25:59.416 --> 26:00.665
I'm gonna bring the wife and kids.

26:02.916 --> 26:04.749
And you be nice.

26:07.583 --> 26:08.957
Be nice.

26:25.875 --> 26:29.124
I feel better about
losing my finger now.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.624
One shot.

26:40.375 --> 26:42.040
I heard you.
What were you shootin' at?

26:42.291 --> 26:43.499
You'll see.

26:46.125 --> 26:48.457
What is that new tune?
Where is it from?

26:48.916 --> 26:50.540
Korea.

26:50.791 --> 26:52.082
Korea?

26:53.333 --> 26:55.290
I like it.
- Me too.

26:56.541 --> 26:58.582
You'll spoil your dinner.

26:58.916 --> 27:00.249
Not a chance.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.957
You say that now.
- I certainly do.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.999
Okay everybody.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.499
Who wants to go down
to the cellar with me?

27:10.041 --> 27:12.040
What do you have in there?
A mountain lion?

27:13.166 --> 27:16.207
This is a hell of a lot better
than a mountain lion, son.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.624
Dad?

27:24.416 --> 27:26.082
What is this?

27:27.250 --> 27:30.415
God only knows
where she's been living, Peg.

27:31.041 --> 27:33.790
In the woods. In caves.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.040
We're gonna help her.

27:36.541 --> 27:39.040
She needs a big Band Aid.

27:39.958 --> 27:41.040
That's right.

27:41.291 --> 27:42.957
That's the first thing
we're gonna fix.

27:43.208 --> 27:44.624
She's been wounded.

27:44.875 --> 27:46.082
We'll get right to it. Okay.

27:46.333 --> 27:50.624
We are all going to have to share in
the responsibility of taking care of her.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.290
Ground rules.

27:53.583 --> 27:55.249
No touching.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.207
I learned the hard way
that our friend here likes to bite.

27:58.458 --> 28:00.124
She bit you?

28:00.375 --> 28:03.749
She took an inch off my finger.
Swallowed it.

28:04.791 --> 28:06.207
Jesus!

28:06.833 --> 28:08.832
What are we gonna do with her?

28:09.375 --> 28:11.415
We're gonna train her, Brian.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.249
Civilize her.

28:13.583 --> 28:16.749
Free her from herself,
from her baser instincts.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.874
This woman thinks
that she is an animal.

28:19.125 --> 28:20.499
And God only knows
how she got that way,

28:20.750 --> 28:22.915
but we cannot have people
running around the woods

28:23.166 --> 28:24.749
thinking they're animals.
It isn't right.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.665
It's not safe.

28:31.958 --> 28:32.957
Belle?

28:34.833 --> 28:35.957
Yes?

28:36.208 --> 28:39.374
Could you run up and
put together a bowl of cereal

28:39.625 --> 28:41.957
or oatmeal or something simple?

28:43.208 --> 28:45.540
She's gotta be hungry.
The only thing she's had to eat

28:45.791 --> 28:47.665
since I captured her is...

28:48.166 --> 28:49.832
Your finger.

28:54.250 --> 28:57.290
And Peg? Go up
and get the first-aid kit.

28:57.541 --> 28:59.582
I wanna see to her wounds.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.082
Okay?

29:01.333 --> 29:02.624
Okay, let's go, girls. Come on.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.999
Better than a mountain lion, son?

29:06.250 --> 29:09.165
Do we really get to keep her?
- We do.

29:15.750 --> 29:18.499
Now, I cannot stress this enough.

29:18.750 --> 29:23.374
For the moment,
everyone keep your distance.

29:24.291 --> 29:26.124
What is that, Belle?
Is that oatmeal?

29:26.375 --> 29:27.457
Yes.
- Good.

29:27.708 --> 29:28.832
Good. It's nice and nutritious.

29:29.083 --> 29:32.082
just go ahead
and set it down. Okay?

29:32.333 --> 29:34.790
So, Belle,
you're gonna set it down.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.165
But not too close. Good.

29:38.416 --> 29:39.957
And now, Brian,

29:41.041 --> 29:43.332
I want you to bring the rake.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.290
Okay. Now push it toward her.

29:48.625 --> 29:51.457
Be careful not to spill it.
Come on.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.040
There you go.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.624
Great. Great.
Everybody, that's teamwork.

29:55.875 --> 29:57.957
Okay? Everybody did their part.

30:05.666 --> 30:07.540
See what I mean about
keeping your distance?

30:09.416 --> 30:12.249
I guess next time
we need to use Rubbermaid.

30:13.458 --> 30:15.207
I'll clean it up. Alright.

30:20.833 --> 30:23.749
If she gets hungry enough, she'll eat.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.457
Okay, look, here,
huddle up. Here.

30:27.416 --> 30:31.665
This is our project
and it's a secret one.

30:32.458 --> 30:34.749
Now, I shouldn't
have to remind you

30:35.000 --> 30:37.040
to keep your mouths zipped,
but I'm doing it anyway.

30:38.208 --> 30:40.874
We're all gonna have to share
in chores with this one.

30:41.125 --> 30:43.290
It's the same as
taking care of the dogs.

30:43.541 --> 30:46.957
Someone's gonna have to
clean up after her and so on.

30:47.208 --> 30:50.615
Your mother and I
will take care of anything...

30:50.833 --> 30:53.457
overly complicated. Right, hon?

30:53.958 --> 30:55.415
Yes.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.540
Okay, then. Well, dinner time.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.207
She may not be hungry,
but I am.

31:02.458 --> 31:04.124
Okay. We'll work out
the details later, okay?

31:04.375 --> 31:06.540
Let's go eat.
Is everybody okay with that?

31:06.791 --> 31:09.374
Everybody okay? Yeah?
Okay. Let's go.

31:39.958 --> 31:41.499
Some salt?

32:00.875 --> 32:02.374
Are you in there?

32:04.500 --> 32:07.290
Well, when I'm sad
I listen to my radio.

32:07.541 --> 32:09.165
Wanna hear?

33:50.833 --> 33:53.082
How are things at school, kiddo?

33:54.291 --> 33:55.665
Fine, dad.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.540
You're a good girl, Peg.

34:13.750 --> 34:18.206
And I know it's hard
sometimes being your age,

34:18.625 --> 34:23.123
but you've got to remember
to look at things on the bright side.

34:26.541 --> 34:29.540
You're gonna get
your license soon, right?

34:32.208 --> 34:34.456
Your grades are good, aren't they?

34:35.208 --> 34:36.665
Yeah.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.415
And you're gonna go to college.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.040
Think about that.

34:50.208 --> 34:51.790
Okay, dad.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.999
I love you, kiddo.

35:07.375 --> 35:09.457
I love you too, dad.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.832
Honey?

35:32.625 --> 35:34.082
That woman.

35:36.666 --> 35:39.457
Do you really think
we should be doing this?

35:58.791 --> 36:00.874
Let's go to bed, babe.

36:24.208 --> 36:26.540
Toby, how are you?
- Good morning. Perfect.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.457
Good morning, Mr. Cleek.

36:39.708 --> 36:40.874
Morning, Dorothy.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.874
So, how did it go with Mrs. Oldenberg?
Is she satisfied with the papers?

36:45.125 --> 36:47.290
Signed them right away.
- Fine, that's fine.

36:47.583 --> 36:50.040
You have lunch with Deanna
at noon, court at two,

36:50.291 --> 36:52.415
then a three-thirty
with the oil company reps.

36:52.666 --> 36:53.832
Are the Ludlow files ready?

36:54.083 --> 36:55.457
I just have to print out this last one.

36:55.708 --> 36:57.332
Okay, fine. Well, look,
when you're done with that,

36:57.583 --> 37:00.540
just bring 'em on in here,
along with another...

37:01.791 --> 37:04.207
cup of mud and
we'll get into it, okay?

37:04.458 --> 37:05.915
Thank you, Dorothy.

37:34.125 --> 37:37.915
Okay. First some stretching,
then eight laps, ladies.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.582
Tracy, pick up the stretcher.

37:47.041 --> 37:48.582
Not feeling well again today, Peg?

37:52.208 --> 37:53.874
There's something going on with her.

37:54.666 --> 37:57.207
This last month or so
she's really changed.

37:57.458 --> 37:58.915
They do at that age.

37:59.166 --> 38:01.540
Yeah, but you know how
they're all dressing these days,

38:01.791 --> 38:04.124
with the short skirts
and the skimpy blouses?

38:05.000 --> 38:05.999
Hadn't noticed it.

38:07.083 --> 38:10.165
Point is, that's how she
used to be too, you know?

38:10.416 --> 38:11.915
She's a very pretty girl.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.290
She ought to be...
- Flaunting it?

38:14.541 --> 38:16.999
Yeah. Dammit. Flaunting it.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.457
Did you flaunt it?

38:19.666 --> 38:22.665
I'd have made you pop
your fucking zipper, Mr. Wolf.

39:09.375 --> 39:10.749
Hey, Belle.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.040
Hi, Darlin'.
How are you two doing today?

39:14.208 --> 39:16.624
We're fine. You?

39:16.916 --> 39:20.707
Good. Yeah, we measured
Bonnie again this morning,

39:20.958 --> 39:23.290
and she has grown
half an inch already.

39:23.541 --> 39:25.582
Can you believe it? God!

39:25.833 --> 39:28.707
So, do you wanna barbecue
again some time soon?

39:29.291 --> 39:31.415
I don't see why not.

39:32.458 --> 39:34.957
The weather's been
perfect for it, hasn't it?

39:35.208 --> 39:38.457
Yeah. So, your place this time?

39:45.208 --> 39:47.957
The place is just a darn mess.

39:49.083 --> 39:52.957
Yeah, well, with all the little ones around,
how can it ever not be, right?

39:53.375 --> 39:54.582
Yeah.

39:54.833 --> 39:57.207
Hey, I gotta run.
See you soon, Vic.

39:57.458 --> 40:00.332
Okay. Listen, maybe I'll pop in
for a coffee sometime.

40:00.583 --> 40:01.957
Surprise you.

41:34.541 --> 41:35.707
So, after you finish that,

41:35.958 --> 41:37.915
would you please
send this to Deanna Plujack,

41:38.166 --> 41:40.165
and then we'll send
the initial check.

41:40.416 --> 41:41.457
Okay.
- Will do.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.957
Mr. Cleek,
may I say something?

41:44.583 --> 41:45.707
Of course, yeah.

41:45.958 --> 41:49.749
It's none of my business, really,
but in this economy,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.749
are you sure
you're not overextending?

41:53.541 --> 41:57.374
Have you ever known me to
let things get out of hand, Dorothy?

41:59.250 --> 42:02.499
No.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.040
That is a wonderful perfume.
That's new, isn't it?

42:07.500 --> 42:09.165
You like it?
- I do.

42:09.416 --> 42:11.457
I like it very much.
That's very nice. Yeah.

42:11.708 --> 42:12.790
Oh, no!
- Oh!

42:13.041 --> 42:14.499
What did you do to your yourself?

42:14.750 --> 42:18.249
Oh, I got too close
to a sweet smelling lady

42:18.500 --> 42:20.290
and she just...

42:34.416 --> 42:36.374
Hey! Give me some.

42:36.625 --> 42:38.665
That's not a very nice way to ask.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.999
Please, Momma? I love you.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.457
At the table.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.790
What kind of cookie do you want?

42:57.041 --> 42:58.790
I want a little man.

42:59.250 --> 43:00.165
This one?

43:00.958 --> 43:02.332
No.
- Oh.

43:02.833 --> 43:03.624
This one?

43:03.875 --> 43:04.832
No.

43:06.916 --> 43:08.207
Yes.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.249
Do you think that animal lady
would eat a little man?

43:13.958 --> 43:17.415
I don't know. I don't know
if she's ever had cookies before.

43:17.666 --> 43:18.874
So why is she here?

43:19.250 --> 43:21.499
Papa's helping her.
You heard him.

43:22.083 --> 43:23.915
Can I have another one?

43:33.333 --> 43:34.332
Brian!

43:34.916 --> 43:36.624
What do you think you're doing?

43:48.875 --> 43:50.332
Just wanted to see if she was okay.

43:51.166 --> 43:53.124
That what you want me
to tell your father?

43:54.916 --> 43:56.374
Want a little man?

43:59.458 --> 44:01.665
Hey! Your supposed
to eat the head first!

44:01.958 --> 44:05.249
Not me. I chop 'em.
Thanks, sis.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.957
Well, hell, Deanna,
I hated to have to write a check,

44:08.208 --> 44:10.124
it cost me a good neighbor,

44:10.375 --> 44:12.207
but if somebody had to,

44:12.458 --> 44:15.207
thought I could be of service.

44:15.625 --> 44:17.165
Sure.

44:17.875 --> 44:20.124
Sure. No, think nothing of it.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.290
Yeah.

44:23.750 --> 44:26.374
No, Belle and I'd be happy
to help you with one of those bottles,

44:26.625 --> 44:28.707
but we can't tonight. No.

44:28.958 --> 44:32.582
We have a family thing tonight.

44:34.708 --> 44:35.915
Okay.

44:36.166 --> 44:37.957
Another time, right?

44:38.250 --> 44:40.165
Alright. Good girl.

44:40.416 --> 44:42.290
Okay, I'll be talkin' to you, Deanna.

44:42.958 --> 44:44.499
Okay. Bye-bye.

44:49.833 --> 44:51.040
Dad?

44:52.583 --> 44:54.290
Could you not?

44:55.208 --> 44:56.665
I made a...

45:08.541 --> 45:11.124
Don't forget about the dogs.
- It's Brian's turn.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.915
Bri?
- On it, dad.

45:14.250 --> 45:16.082
Grab the poop shovel
while you're at it.

45:19.333 --> 45:20.332
Shut up!

45:21.750 --> 45:24.290
You want the goddamn hose?

45:44.250 --> 45:45.582
Hey, girl.

45:48.666 --> 45:49.915
Why don't you come out and eat?

45:55.208 --> 45:56.665
You bitch!

46:22.541 --> 46:25.457
Peggy, can I talk to you for a sec?

46:26.708 --> 46:28.582
I don't want to be late for next period.

46:28.833 --> 46:32.040
I'll write you a note.
Have a seat for a sec.

46:42.458 --> 46:43.582
You alright?

46:44.875 --> 46:46.124
Yeah. Why?

46:46.500 --> 46:50.040
Nausea. Baggy clothes.
Mrs. Hindle tells me

46:50.291 --> 46:52.999
you've been sitting out
of gym for weeks now.

46:53.250 --> 46:55.124
Hey, I'm not stupid, Peggy.

46:55.833 --> 46:57.665
Why don't you just
mind your own business?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.165
You are my business.

47:14.083 --> 47:16.457
I'm gonna eat you!

47:54.416 --> 47:55.790
Where have you been?

47:56.041 --> 47:58.624
Playing with the dogs a little.

47:59.375 --> 48:00.624
You?

48:01.208 --> 48:02.415
Yeah.

48:03.166 --> 48:04.999
I do that sometimes.

48:05.958 --> 48:07.832
So, are we ready, Belle?

48:08.083 --> 48:09.457
Yeah.

48:09.916 --> 48:12.249
Okay then. Grab the buckets.

48:18.750 --> 48:20.582
So how we doin' today?

48:24.041 --> 48:25.915
I hate to do this to you.

48:26.291 --> 48:28.457
But with you I'm not
taking any more chances.

48:41.541 --> 48:43.040
We gonna scrub her down, pop?

48:43.291 --> 48:46.082
I've never seen or smelled
anything that nasty before.

48:46.333 --> 48:48.582
Well, your mother and I
are gonna scrub her down,

48:48.833 --> 48:50.790
but first you're gonna
clean up her mess.

48:51.041 --> 48:53.457
Me?
- Grab the scoop shovel.

48:54.083 --> 48:55.624
Get a rag.

48:57.083 --> 49:00.457
I guess we're gonna have to keep
doing this until we can get her,

49:00.708 --> 49:01.957
you know...

49:02.333 --> 49:04.207
Potty trained?
- Exactly.

49:07.583 --> 49:08.832
Get.

49:09.625 --> 49:10.790
But I can help.

49:13.416 --> 49:14.832
Shut the door.

49:18.416 --> 49:19.915
Let's go.

49:21.166 --> 49:22.749
Get a bucket.

49:31.583 --> 49:32.582
Thank you.

49:48.458 --> 49:50.582
Maybe we should let
that cool off a bit before...

49:50.833 --> 49:53.249
Belle, we both know

49:53.500 --> 49:57.040
the only way to get something clean
is with good hot water.

49:57.291 --> 50:01.832
Otherwise, we're just
shuffling germs around

50:02.666 --> 50:06.582
if we use cold
or, hell, even luke warm.

50:07.750 --> 50:09.124
Good.

50:09.583 --> 50:12.915
See? Good. Look. There.

50:13.958 --> 50:16.832
Belle, I'm gonna need
that other bucket.

50:18.125 --> 50:19.665
Get the bucket.

50:28.166 --> 50:30.749
Don't look at me
like you're jealous.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.249
This has to be done, Belle.

50:36.250 --> 50:38.540
Would you bring
the other bucket, please?

51:57.958 --> 51:59.124
Chris?

52:01.416 --> 52:02.540
Look.

52:04.666 --> 52:05.832
Good eye, Belle.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.832
I think I've got...

52:09.125 --> 52:12.290
Yeah. I've got everything
I need down here to fix that.

52:13.375 --> 52:14.540
Oh.

52:15.250 --> 52:17.165
That's a good start. Thanks.

52:18.833 --> 52:19.999
Okay.

52:20.250 --> 52:21.915
I'm gonna need you to get Brian.

52:22.208 --> 52:24.499
Tell him to go to the wood shed

52:24.750 --> 52:27.165
and I want him to get a log.

52:27.416 --> 52:29.499
Tell him to cut it to six feet.

52:29.750 --> 52:33.207
We can't clean her down here,
we're gonna have to take her outside.

52:33.458 --> 52:35.207
Okay? We're gonna need Peg too.

52:35.458 --> 52:36.832
Thanks, Belle.

52:37.083 --> 52:38.582
You got it?

53:23.583 --> 53:25.957
That's perfect.
It's perfect. That'll do it.

53:26.208 --> 53:28.624
Listen, go in the house,
get your mom and Peg.

53:28.875 --> 53:30.290
Can I help?

53:30.666 --> 53:32.415
No, you've done enough already.

53:48.375 --> 53:51.124
Dad wants you. He wants Peg too.
- Well, go get her.

53:53.875 --> 53:55.332
Hey, Peg!

53:56.666 --> 54:00.415
Dad wants you!
- Brian! Go up and get her.

54:00.666 --> 54:04.582
Do not scream in my house!
- Sorry.

54:04.833 --> 54:06.790
And go up to your room
and stay in there

54:07.041 --> 54:08.665
while we are working,
do you understand?

54:08.916 --> 54:10.415
Fine.

55:00.416 --> 55:04.040
Please!

55:10.041 --> 55:12.165
Peg! She's not clean.

55:16.250 --> 55:22.957
Please.

55:26.458 --> 55:30.707
Ladies, go get the towels
and get that first-aid kit, okay?

55:30.958 --> 55:32.290
Let's go.

55:40.250 --> 55:41.665
You're learning.

56:02.125 --> 56:03.540
Dry her off.

56:05.291 --> 56:07.082
Is it safe now?

56:08.125 --> 56:09.540
Yeah. Don't worry.

56:14.208 --> 56:16.749
Says the man with nine fingers.

56:28.208 --> 56:29.582
Go ahead in.

56:32.833 --> 56:34.499
Dry as a bone now.

56:34.750 --> 56:37.457
We don't want her
coming down with something.

56:39.666 --> 56:42.957
Hon? Give me one
of those cotton balls

56:43.375 --> 56:45.957
and soaked in peroxide, please.

56:55.250 --> 56:56.832
This is gonna hurt.

57:17.500 --> 57:21.540
It buttons here and here,

57:21.791 --> 57:24.249
so you don't have to...

57:24.708 --> 57:27.749
undo her or anything.

57:29.416 --> 57:30.874
That's great.

57:31.125 --> 57:33.040
Why don't you throw it on her?

57:40.708 --> 57:42.957
It's okay, she's not
gonna do anything.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.374
This is just all
new to her, that's all.

57:46.625 --> 57:48.665
She's a little scared.

57:50.333 --> 57:52.332
She has a lot of scars.

57:53.416 --> 57:56.165
What do you imagine
she's been doing?

57:56.416 --> 57:58.040
Maybe some day she can tell us.

57:58.291 --> 58:00.207
I don't think she likes it.

58:01.083 --> 58:03.040
She's never had a dress
on her before, Belle.

58:03.291 --> 58:05.249
You probably didn't like it

58:05.500 --> 58:07.540
the first time
you had a dress, huh?

58:12.666 --> 58:14.082
There.

58:16.958 --> 58:21.624
She looks like one of those
polygamist wives, doesn't she?

58:23.166 --> 58:24.582
Yeah.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.040
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:17.040
Thank you.

01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:27.999
Thaaaank you.

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.999
Thank you.

01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:43.082
Read my mind, babe.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.332
Your kids still giving you a hard day?

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.999
No, they're fine.

01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:54.165
What's with the paper?

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:56.790
It's a phone number and an address.

01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:58.499
Peggy Cleek's parents.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.707
I'm pretty sure she's pregnant.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.665
You are not thinking
of telling them, are you?

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:07.999
Well, shouldn't I?
- Could make things worse.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.540
It's gonna be
very obvious very soon.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.665
It's your call.
I gotta go lock up.

01:01:13.916 --> 01:01:15.790
I'll be back in a sec.

01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:24.499
Hell, it never fails at dinner time.

01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:29.332
Peg, would you see
who that is, please?

01:01:34.333 --> 01:01:35.957
I was on the phone all day.

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:38.374
Don't make that noise, hon.

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:40.374
I don't like that noise.

01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:43.290
Hello. This is Genevieve Raton,

01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:45.707
and this message
is for Mr. or Mrs. Cleek.

01:01:45.958 --> 01:01:49.457
Your daughter Peggy is
a student in my geometry class...

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:53.457
Message erased.
You have no new messages.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.582
Darlin', turn that down.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.290
Peggy, what are you doing?

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:57.415
It's time for school.

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:01.457
Come on, I'm driving you today.

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.540
I don't feel so good, mom.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.332
Can I stay home today?

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:15.540
Peggy. There is
nothing wrong with you.

01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:17.290
You got a half-day today, huh?

01:07:17.625 --> 01:07:18.915
Yep.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:21.957
What are you gonna do
with all that free time?

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:30.124
Well, don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:31.749
Okay, dad.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.165
If I get up I'm gonna be sick.

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.207
Fine.

01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:43.582
I don't want Brian here
alone after school, anyway.

01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:11.082
Hey, Brian.
- What's up?

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:14.249
A bunch of us are going to the movies.
Want to come along?

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.040
I gotta head home.

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:20.082
I got some stuff to do.
- Okay then. Maybe next time.

01:08:20.625 --> 01:08:22.624
Sure. Next time.

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:24.249
Bye, Brian.

01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:00.874
Who the hell doesn't like cookies?

01:11:36.666 --> 01:11:38.624
What the hell
are you doing, Brian?

01:11:38.875 --> 01:11:41.082
You're in trouble now,
you little shit!

01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:43.957
Get out of here! You're sick!

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.624
I'm so sorry...

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:13.665
about all of this.

01:12:38.166 --> 01:12:39.957
Darlin', go to your room.

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:42.540
Why? I didn't do anything.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:48.124
Honey, this isn't about you.
This is about your brother.

01:12:48.416 --> 01:12:50.915
Go to your room, good girl.

01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.415
Do you know what your son did?

01:13:07.833 --> 01:13:09.165
Do you want to know?

01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:12.040
I'm not sure I do.

01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:13.915
He didn't think
anyone was home today.

01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:17.207
So he went down there. With her.

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:21.332
Had her dress off.
Had her naked.

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:24.415
He was touching her.

01:13:26.458 --> 01:13:28.540
And touching himself.

01:13:30.916 --> 01:13:32.290
If Peg hadn't caught him at it

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:34.582
there's no telling what would
have gone on down there.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.832
Is this true, son?

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:42.374
Peggy caught him!
Didn't you hear me?

01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:46.165
Why the hell are you
asking him is it true?

01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:49.457
Calm down, Belle.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:51.082
He had one hand on her

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:53.165
and the other down
his goddamn jeans, Chris!

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.457
I'm telling you

01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:57.415
to take it easy.

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:08.124
You better look at me
when I'm talkin' to you.

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:11.332
Is this true?

01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:22.832
Okay, so no one was hurt?

01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:29.582
No... What?

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:32.374
No one was hurt.

01:14:33.166 --> 01:14:34.874
He's a boy.

01:14:36.208 --> 01:14:39.165
He's an adolescent.
Adolescents have urges.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.665
Boys will be boys.

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:44.624
You know, now that she's
cleaned up, I have to say,

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.249
she's not half bad to look at,
you know what I mean?

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.165
I can't fucking do this anymore!

01:14:51.458 --> 01:14:55.415
You can't do this to us, Chris!
Have you lost your mind?

01:14:57.625 --> 01:14:59.749
You can't just stand there and smile

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.540
when your own son
thinks it's okay to...

01:15:01.791 --> 01:15:03.040
To what?

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.415
You are an officer of the court!

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.915
She is a human being!

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.457
Do you know what would happen
to all of us if you got caught?

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:19.082
just what's going on with
the goddamn dogs out there

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:20.957
is enough to put you in prison.

01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:30.499
Anophthalmia, Belle.
It's your shame.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.082
Anophthalmia, remember that?

01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:34.582
Do you?

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:39.290
I never condoned what you did.

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:42.915
Never.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:49.332
You can't just keep putting
one thing on top of the other

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:52.415
and expect to get
away with it forever.

01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:56.415
Chris, I...

01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:59.124
I've had it!

01:16:00.083 --> 01:16:01.374
Okay.

01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:06.499
So what are you gonna do?
I mean, what is your plan?

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:10.124
What? I don't...
I just would like to know.

01:16:10.916 --> 01:16:13.707
What the fuck you think
you're gonna do about it?

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.874
I'm leaving.

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:25.582
I'm leaving you, Chris.

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:29.374
And I'm taking the girls with me.

01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:35.207
You can have your
little rapist son to yourself.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.207
You're already teaching him every
goddamn thing he needs to know,

01:16:40.458 --> 01:16:41.457
aren't you?

01:16:42.375 --> 01:16:46.040
You can damn well
burn together, the two of you.

01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:49.790
But you are not
hurting my girls anymore.

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:52.707
It's over.

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:54.290
Right now.

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:57.499
You can't do this to us, Chris!

01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:59.749
I can't do this!

01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:06.832
I can't?

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.540
I can!

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:19.582
She'll be fine.

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.415
She's okay.

01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:31.040
Get a cold cloth
for your mother, Peg.

01:17:32.958 --> 01:17:34.915
Peg, let's go!

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:54.249
Why don't you answer
the door? See who it is.

01:18:05.291 --> 01:18:06.832
Miss Raton?

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:09.124
Peggy. Hi.

01:18:10.666 --> 01:18:12.415
You gonna invite me in?

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:17.707
This really isn't the time...

01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:19.665
Sure it is, Peggy.

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:24.457
Hey, I'm not here to hurt you.

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:26.249
I wanna help.

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:30.749
You can't help.
- Well, how do you know that?

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.457
I just do.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.332
I know doctors, counselors,
all kinds of people.

01:18:39.791 --> 01:18:42.915
I said this isn't
the time, Miss Raton!

01:18:44.166 --> 01:18:45.707
Peg, where are your manners?

01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:48.790
Hi, come on in.
- Thank you.

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:52.290
Miss...?
- Raton.

01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:54.790
Raton. I remember.

01:18:55.041 --> 01:18:57.665
Yeah. Geometry.
- Yes.

01:18:57.916 --> 01:18:59.165
Geometry. That's right.

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:01.915
I met you at Parents' Night.

01:19:02.166 --> 01:19:04.290
Yes.
- Please, have a seat.

01:19:05.416 --> 01:19:07.290
Can I get you anything?

01:19:07.541 --> 01:19:10.207
Are you thirsty?
Would you like some...

01:19:10.458 --> 01:19:12.624
Soda pop or coffee, nothing?

01:19:12.875 --> 01:19:14.915
I'm fine, thank you.
- Okay.

01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:20.165
May I speak with you and
your wife privately, Mr. Cleek?

01:19:20.791 --> 01:19:23.332
Please, call me Chris, Miss Raton.

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:24.499
Chris.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.540
And you are...?

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:31.040
Genevieve.

01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:34.249
Genevieve.
It's a beautiful name.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.124
She's really not feeling very well.

01:19:41.375 --> 01:19:43.624
She's having herself
a little power nap.

01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:46.540
So this is about Peg, I gather?

01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:47.999
Yes.

01:19:48.375 --> 01:19:50.665
Then I suppose she should hear it.

01:19:52.791 --> 01:19:53.915
My son as well.

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:57.999
We have no secrets
in this family, Miss Raton.

01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:59.707
Brian?

01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:01.665
Come here, son.

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:15.040
I've observed some...

01:20:15.833 --> 01:20:19.249
distressing behavior
as of late, Mr. Cleek.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:23.540
Chris.

01:20:24.708 --> 01:20:26.665
Peggy isn't looking well.

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:32.332
She's had to rush out to use the ladies
rest room several times during class.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.082
Her studies are off,

01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:38.040
and she's taken to wearing clothes
that are much too big for her.

01:20:42.083 --> 01:20:44.165
Well, she does like
to wear my sweats.

01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:49.332
Does Peggy have a boyfriend,
do you know, Mr. Cleek?

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:51.165
No.

01:20:53.291 --> 01:20:55.749
And I would know if she did.

01:20:58.791 --> 01:21:00.124
Why?

01:21:01.458 --> 01:21:06.207
I believe that Peggy
is pregnant, Mr. Cleek.

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:13.665
Pregnant.
- I am not!

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:22.082
What makes you think that
Peggy is pregnant, Miss Raton?

01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:24.499
Well, she's showing, Mr. Cleek.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:28.332
Not very much right now,
but that won't last much longer.

01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:40.457
Do any of your colleagues
concur with this opinion, Miss Raton?

01:21:40.708 --> 01:21:42.999
I wouldn't know.
I haven't discussed it with them.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:44.582
I thought it best

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:46.915
to come directly
to you and your wife.

01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:49.374
It was good of you to do so.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.915
I thought teachers
were supposed to listen,

01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:01.874
but you're not very good at listening,
are you, Miss Raton?

01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:04.915
Because I told you
Peggy does not have a boyfriend

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:06.415
and that if she did
I would know about it.

01:22:06.666 --> 01:22:08.374
Did I not say that?

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:10.832
Well, yes, but...

01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:13.040
So you're accusing Brian?

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:19.249
He's just a boy.
- Absolutely not!

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.040
So you're accusing me?

01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:22.624
No.

01:22:22.916 --> 01:22:24.124
No, I...

01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:26.582
No. You're accusing me?

01:22:26.833 --> 01:22:27.582
Dad!

01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:31.957
You come to my house and you
accuse me of something like that.

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:34.040
I said nothing
of the sort, Mr. Cleek.

01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:35.999
I know you didn't say
anything of the sort.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:37.832
It's what you haven't said.

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:39.832
You think I'm stupid?

01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:42.415
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.040
No.
- Miss Raton?

01:22:47.166 --> 01:22:47.957
Yes?

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:50.957
You don't really...

01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:55.582
think that I would want to
miss out on heaven, do you?

01:23:01.166 --> 01:23:02.749
Hey, Brian?

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:04.957
Would you get the rope?

01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:19.040
Please!

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:22.082
Daddy, please stop!

01:23:22.708 --> 01:23:25.165
Daddy, please, she's my teacher!

01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:28.040
Please, she's my friend, daddy!
- Your friend?

01:23:28.291 --> 01:23:29.874
Your friend, is that what you said?

01:23:30.125 --> 01:23:31.874
Well, your friend just
came to expose you

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:34.165
for the little slut whore that you are!

01:23:35.166 --> 01:23:36.832
Daddy, you can't!

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.957
You can't! You can't! You can't!

01:23:44.208 --> 01:23:46.457
I am so fucking sick

01:23:46.708 --> 01:23:50.749
of "you can't" from
the women in this family!

01:23:51.125 --> 01:23:51.999
Your mother,

01:23:52.708 --> 01:23:55.665
your idiot sisters, you!

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.249
Please. Let me go.

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.874
I swear I won't tell anyone.

01:24:01.125 --> 01:24:02.415
Yeah, I know you won't.

01:24:08.541 --> 01:24:09.790
You know what?

01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:12.915
Make that all women.

01:24:13.791 --> 01:24:17.165
Make that all women.
Because you're leeches,

01:24:17.541 --> 01:24:21.540
every one of you suck a man dry,

01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:26.332
who works like a dog every day
and you suck him dry!

01:24:28.375 --> 01:24:29.249
Chris...

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:32.082
Stop it!
- Shut up, lady!

01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:38.832
Do you know what
you're good for, Peg?

01:24:39.083 --> 01:24:40.624
Do you?

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:44.499
You and every other whining bitch,

01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:49.040
you're good for one thing
and one thing only.

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:53.082
And half the time
you're miserable at that.

01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:56.415
You think I don't know who you are?

01:24:56.666 --> 01:24:58.582
You think I don't know?

01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:03.124
You're no different than that thing,
that thing in the cellar.

01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:05.790
That's where you all belong!

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:08.040
Each and every cunting one of you!

01:25:21.208 --> 01:25:22.457
No!

01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:24.540
Brian,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.665
I lost my composure there.

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:29.749
I got a little emotional.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.915
Never let emotions
get the best of you. Okay?

01:25:33.166 --> 01:25:34.582
Okay.
- Good.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.832
I want you to get the door, son.

01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:41.249
We'll handle this one right away.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.332
No! No!

01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:50.374
No, please, help me!

01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:52.332
I swear I won't tell anyone.

01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:08.749
Hold on to her!

01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:10.624
I got her, dad.

01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:15.374
Peggy?

01:26:48.125 --> 01:26:51.040
Momma, what's
happening to the doggies?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.624
It's okay, come here, honey.

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:11.124
Go to your room and lock the door.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.749
That's a very bad idea.

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:39.249
Bad idea.

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:46.540
Can you say Anophthalmia?

01:27:53.208 --> 01:27:54.790
Oh, yeah, sister,
let's see what you can do!

01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:57.374
Anophthalmia!

01:29:01.666 --> 01:29:03.040
Peggy?

01:29:03.291 --> 01:29:04.999
What have you done?

01:30:36.958 --> 01:30:39.332
She doesn't even look
real anymore, does she, dad?

01:30:39.583 --> 01:30:41.249
She does to me, son.

01:31:02.166 --> 01:31:03.790
Listen, I want you
to go to the house,

01:31:04.041 --> 01:31:05.165
wake your mom up.

01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:08.499
Get some cleaning supplies,
some lawn leaf bags, okay?

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:10.832
They're never gonna
be able to eat all this.

01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:13.082
Sure, dad.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.290
Get me a soda pop
while you're at it.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.332
Getjacked up on that caffeine.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.499
Darlin'!

01:34:06.333 --> 01:34:07.790
Stay with me, okay?

01:34:08.041 --> 01:34:09.790
I want mommy!

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:11.790
Shit! He's got his keys!

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:18.874
Can you hold this for me?
Don't drop that.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:20.915
Dammit!

01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:23.665
Shit!

01:34:23.916 --> 01:34:25.790
Hey, it's the lady and sister.

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:36.290
Darlin'!
