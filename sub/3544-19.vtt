00:02.160 --> 00:03.880
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.920 --> 00:07.481
We think the Travelers
are about to make their move.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.085
Their leader, Markos, is here.

00:09.240 --> 00:13.131
He's been dead for centuries and we think
the fire sacrifice allowed him to escape.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.681
- From where?
- The Other Side.

00:14.800 --> 00:18.521
They've taken over towns
by putting Passengers inside of townsfolk.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.762
They're doing the same thing
in Mystic Falls.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.729
- We're in.
- This body is incredible.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.120
Don't get used to it.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.089
What about you? Any pretty girls?

00:26.240 --> 00:28.481
Actually, there was one.
Her name was Maggie.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.210
She was working for Dr. Whitmore.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.443
When she finally realized
what was going on, she couldn't bear it.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.329
She said she was sorry and she left.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.166
No offense, but even if she still was
alive, wouldn't she be, like, really old?

00:39.320 --> 00:42.802
Seventy years of captivity
and she was the face that I clung onto.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.645
I don't wanna date her, Caroline.
I wanna thank her.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.167
You mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

00:48.320 --> 00:51.608
Doppelganger blood can help the Travelers.
Why don't we take a walk?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.444
- You stay here.
- Not bloody likely.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.490
You wanna find Maggie, you stay here.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.971
I still need you in my life.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.448
As friends, right? I don't wanna talk to you.
I don't wanna look at you.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.161
- And I sure as hell don't wanna be your friend.
- Okay.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.161
Breakfast, Professor Salvatore?

01:16.320 --> 01:19.369
Oh, no, no, no. I see what you're doing.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.967
What am I doing?

01:21.520 --> 01:23.010
Distraction tactics.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.161
Stay focused.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.486
So Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology
share the assumption that...?

01:30.640 --> 01:34.361
Scientific methods can be used
to understand human behavior.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.488
That's very good, as in verbatim.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.849
Which means that I need
to ask you more difficult questions.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.162
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:46.160 --> 01:50.802
Volunteering to help me study. The day after
Damon declared that we can't be friends...

01:51.000 --> 01:54.004
and that he never wants
to see my face again.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.363
Speaking of distracting tactics...

01:56.520 --> 02:00.002
- You're welcome.
- Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.891
- What did I miss?
- Just that Stefan's the tutor from hell.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.371
Unkind. Take that back.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.041
Actually, I'm surprised
that you're up for studying.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.884
You know, considering...

02:12.560 --> 02:14.767
- Considering?
- The Other Side.

02:15.840 --> 02:16.887
Falling apart?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.651
- She's in denial.
- So I see.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.565
I'm not in denial.
The Other Side is disintegrating.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.691
As the anchor to the Other Side, I'm only
alive as long as there is an Other Side.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.446
I'm perfectly aware of the threat
of my impending death.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.046
There is nothing I can do.
It's called acceptance.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.680
Fifth stage of grief.
Look it up, tutor guy.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.646
Definitely in denial.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.083
Yeah. Look, Bonnie.
I've already lost you once.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.527
We're not doing this again.
It's not an option.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.884
Not to mention what's gonna happen to Alaric
and your grams and everyone else over there.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.485
So, what are we gonna do?

02:49.640 --> 02:53.611
Fine, if you guys promise to stop hovering,
I'll ask Liv if she has any witchy ideas.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.207
Don't we have bigger problems with Travelers
trying to take over Mystic Falls?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.084
Oh, no, Damon's already on that.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.647
- He is?
- Did I say Damon?

03:02.800 --> 03:05.121
What I meant to say was George.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.606
Damon said that he never wanted
to see me again.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.122
I guess we're both in denial.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.290
Ugh. Whose nasty-ass boxers
are under the couch?

03:17.440 --> 03:19.568
Not mine. I actually do my laundry.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.125
It's not in the floor safe.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.011
Or the kitchen cabinets, or the garage,
or the bookshelves.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.446
The Traveler knife is gone.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.644
- Are you sure Tyler hid it where he said he did?
- Obviously not.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.964
Ding-dong.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.851
- Invite me in.
- We can hear you just fine from there.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.686
Oh, I'm so sorry I interrupted
whatever weird ritual you two were doing.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.045
I just want to de-Passenger
the citizens of Mystic Falls...

03:41.240 --> 03:44.528
using your magical Traveler knife,
so hand it over.

03:44.680 --> 03:45.920
That's gonna be a problem.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.442
Five words that make me wanna vamp toss
my keys into your chest cavity.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.446
Little Gilbert, help me in the fight
against my dark side and elaborate, please.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.046
- We can't find it.
- As in you lost it?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.806
- As in it's not here.
- You're right. Don't invite me in.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.169
- Because I will kill both of you.
- Tyler said he hid it in the piano.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.482
And when was the last time
you heard from Tyler?

04:17.959 --> 04:20.166
- Where the hell am I?
- Not here.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.166
Welcome back, Julian.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.848
Apologies for the precautions.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.566
But you're passengered
into the body of a hybrid.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.520
It's hard to know how long you have
before his consciousness returns.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.531
I see we moved yet again.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.571
- At least this is a step up.
- Just trying to keep our people comfortable.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.482
With luck, our days of striking camp
are numbered.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.330
Sloan.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.202
Two thousand years ago...

04:57.400 --> 04:59.368
the witches put a curse on our tribe...

04:59.520 --> 05:03.684
so nature should turn against us should
we ever attempt to settle as a people.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.563
We have lived without a home...

05:06.720 --> 05:09.371
roaming like cattle.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.607
The prophecy states
that we can break that curse.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.368
But in order to undo a witch's curse...

05:18.520 --> 05:20.568
one must have the power...

05:21.360 --> 05:23.408
to undo a witch's magic.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.924
Our faithful Sloan has
volunteered to be the...

05:28.080 --> 05:29.923
How do you say?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.651
Guinea pig of our little experiment.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.084
Drink.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.644
Are you ready, Sloan?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.045
I'm ready.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.089
And to what do I owe the pleasure?

06:00.240 --> 06:02.447
Don't know where I can find a Traveler,
do you?

06:02.600 --> 06:04.682
You know Travelers. Vagabonds and the like.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.450
Haven't seen any. Why?

06:06.600 --> 06:11.288
Got two brain-dead teenagers who didn't realize
two plus two equals one hijacked hybrid.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.488
Don't envy you there, mate.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.523
Well, what do you say? Field trip?

06:15.680 --> 06:18.763
I mean, I'm sure there's some salvage yard
we haven't toured yet.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.123
It's dangerous to let Tweedledee
and Tweedle-dumber out of the house.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.931
Last thing we need is another
Traveler possession.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.844
Sadly, I've got to take a rain check.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.567
I'm late to meet some people.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.965
What?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.770
Nothing.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.401
Not really nothing.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.168
More like a rhetorical question about how
to fix an imploding supernatural purgatory.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.451
Oh, great, he's here.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.170
You know Enzo?

06:52.920 --> 06:54.684
Yup, not a fan.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.523
- What are you doing here?
- Can't join my friends for a cup of tea?

07:03.160 --> 07:08.405
Damon, your friend, uh, singular, isn't
here and we're a little busy right now.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.010
But by all means, have a seat.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.487
No need to be rude.
I've come here for a chat.

07:15.640 --> 07:21.044
Elena, darling, perhaps Caroline told you
I've been searching for someone I once knew.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.440
A woman named Maggie.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.365
Your elusive girlfriend
from the Augustine days.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.409
Maggie worked there as an observer.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.961
Taking notes on my behavior.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.410
<i>She never got too close,
never took off her vervain bracelet.</i>

07:34.560 --> 07:38.201
<i>But we spent hours and hours talking
and we developed an attachment.</i>

07:45.560 --> 07:47.688
Now, she left in 1950.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.049
I imagined her one day teaching
in one of these fancy universities.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.890
Starting a family.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.848
Living her life to the fullest.
I'm sure you two can appreciate that.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.204
What's going on?

08:00.680 --> 08:03.411
That Traveler girl, Sloan,
gave me this yesterday.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.684
Making good on a promise.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.844
From the Augustine files left behind
by our good Dr. Wes.

08:17.920 --> 08:21.049
Yes, imagine how I felt when I saw it.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.361
Turns out Maggie died in 1960.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.722
In Mystic Falls.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.087
Someone tore her head right off her body.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.642
- In 1960, were you...?
- A Ripper? Clearly.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.570
I wasn't a Ripper then.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.330
I'm really sorry about your friend.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.730
But I had nothing to do with it.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.403
I thought you might say that.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.281
Liv.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.521
Little service here, please.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.962
Liv, what are you doing? Stop.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.451
I can't stop. Sorry.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.404
That's my fault, really. Where's Luke?

09:05.600 --> 09:09.446
I compelled blokes from the rugby team
to keep her brother's life in jeopardy...

09:09.600 --> 09:12.809
so that should the witch disobey,
he will die.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.007
There's a good soldier.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.520
Okay, Stefan, are you ready to talk
about what you did to the love of my life?

09:56.160 --> 09:59.881
- Tell him to use me instead.
- I don't really think he's up for taking orders.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.729
Besides, I'm older than you.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.360
- By five minutes.
- Get him out of here. Now.

10:05.520 --> 10:09.081
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Get him out.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.210
Too many witches under one roof
makes me nervous.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.207
I'll let you know if he needs to die.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.963
That vervain water is going to hurt even
worse if you struggle against those knots.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.171
Chap's in the sailing club.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.004
How did you compel everyone here?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.640
Place opens at 8. You got here at 9.
Do the math, college girl.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.885
I will gladly release them
once you admit you killed Maggie.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.522
I would love to, except I have absolutely
no idea who she is.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.402
That's what this is for. Police found it
on her body at the crime scene.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.282
"June 10th, 1951.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.887
I found a job at a pre-school.
I love the kids, but still I feel lost.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.241
Listless.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.566
March, 1953.
While my girlfriends have all found love...

10:56.720 --> 10:59.246
for some reason I can't seem
to connect with anyone.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.051
As if a part of my soul is missing or dead.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.402
My sister said there are more men in the city.
Maybe I'll move."

11:07.880 --> 11:11.680
Now, it turns out she did move
to the city in 1958.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.730
In the move, she uncovered a box
she hadn't touched in years.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.611
Medical journals from 1950.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.082
Covered in notes about a special
vampire patient named 12144.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.047
When she came back,
Whitmore House had burned...

11:24.280 --> 11:27.284
and it was concluded
that I had perished in the fire.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.442
You're a journal man, aren't you, Stefan?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.728
This is ridiculous.
In 1960, I was cleaned up.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.082
I was barely feeding on people,
let alone killing them.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.806
Good idea. Let's call Damon.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.088
How is it Travelers are everywhere
until you actually need to find one?

11:50.280 --> 11:51.566
Hunt going poorly then?

11:51.720 --> 11:54.769
That's what I get
for working with the Hardy Boys.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.446
I take it you don't
have Stefan's diaries handy.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.082
I need you to check his journal
for an entry on November 8th, 1960.

12:01.320 --> 12:05.166
Stefan burned his journals a while ago.
He was in a mood. Why?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.448
Ah. Just trying to settle a little debate.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.443
No matter. I'm right.

12:10.720 --> 12:15.760
How are you hanging in there, man? I heard
you exiled Elena from your eye-line.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.246
How'd you hear that?

12:19.480 --> 12:21.482
Are you with them right now?

12:21.640 --> 12:24.689
Not for long.
I reckon one will be dead soon.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.171
Eye for an eye and all that.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.641
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Enzo.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.968
You have your murder voice on.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.489
I need you to speak very slowly, very calmly,
and tell me what the hell the problem is.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.483
The problem, if you must know...

12:37.640 --> 12:41.531
is my girl, Maggie, the one who got away,
turns out she didn't get away for long.

12:41.680 --> 12:45.480
Your Ripper of a brother took a big bite
out of her neck membrane in the '60s.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.961
- Sixties? Stefan wasn't even...
- Gotta jet, mate.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.369
Nothing personal. Just a bit of revenge.
You understand.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.842
Any history majors in the house?

12:56.360 --> 12:57.646
Ah. Trick question.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.690
I compelled them all not to speak.
Never mind. We'll use this.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.166
1960.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.489
Let's see. Ford Thunderbirds.
Lincoln Continentals.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.483
Unseasonably cold that year.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.721
Tuesday, November 8th.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.042
John F. Kennedy was running for president.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.368
Election night.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.767
You're okay.
Forget this ever happened.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.081
And run.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.365
Gold star for impulse control.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.363
Don't worry. Not here to judge.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.887
- Who the hell are you?
- Maggie James.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.724
And you're Stefan Salvatore.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.562
Another vampire.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.603
Sorry, this is all so fascinating.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.530
Here, I've been staring
at Damon's picture for years.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.248
Guess you got the handsome genes.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.044
What do you know about my family?

14:27.200 --> 14:30.249
I've spent the last two years
searching for your brother.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.722
- I know everything about you.
- Why are you so obsessed with my brother?

14:33.880 --> 14:37.362
He knew a friend who died in a fire.
Hoping you'd know where to find him.

14:37.560 --> 14:41.770
Ah. Why don't you do yourself a favor
and stay away from my brother?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.964
He's a monster.
Fell off the rails a couple of years ago.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.043
There's no talking sense into him.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.282
It's a good thing
I don't wanna talk to him.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.206
I wanna kill him.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.884
So you want me to tell you where
my brother is so that you can kill him.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.801
You just said he's a lost cause.
I'd be doing the world a favor.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.800
Hmm.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.291
Well, it's too bad
you're not doing yourself any favors.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.887
No, no!

15:12.120 --> 15:14.851
- That was Maggie?
- Now we're getting somewhere.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.163
I didn't kill her. I was just trying
to scare her into leaving town.

15:18.320 --> 15:22.848
- So it was the other Ripper in Mystic Falls.
- I have no reason to lie to you, Enzo.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.082
- Are your lies worth Bonnie's life?
- Bonnie!

15:27.240 --> 15:29.129
What exactly happens if you die, anyway?

15:29.320 --> 15:31.129
- Let go of me.
- Aren't you already dead?

15:31.320 --> 15:33.527
- Should we find out?
- Stop.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.324
You're right.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.646
I killed Maggie.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.326
I tore out her throat
and I ripped her head off.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.410
I completely forgot about her until now.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.642
That's the truth.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.643
Now let her go.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.044
Take her upstairs.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.806
- Are you okay?
- You can cut the scared hostage act.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.689
- Excuse me?
- Enzo may be using you...

16:05.840 --> 16:08.491
as his pocket witch,
but if he kills either of them...

16:08.640 --> 16:11.962
the Travelers can't do what they need
to with the doppelganger blood.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.366
And the witches win.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.370
Well, aren't you clever?
You should be a magic teacher.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.484
Blondie, now is not the time
to be screening my calls.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.361
You're the only one unaccounted for and I
don't know where Elena and Stefan are.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.528
At least call your mother.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.087
Why the sudden interest
in Mystic Falls history?

16:39.240 --> 16:43.529
You know when your brother kills your only
friend's girl and you're stuck in the middle?

16:44.080 --> 16:46.890
- No.
- Well, then, don't ask.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.844
- Okay, 1960.
- Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.048
There was a mugging
reported November 9th.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.329
No, no, no, it has to be the 8th.
He's very specific about the 8th.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.244
Well, that would be Maggie James.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.164
Died November 8th, 1960.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.606
Unresolved homicide.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.249
Possible serial killer.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.604
Ooh.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.250
Stefan was right.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.404
- He didn't kill Enzo's girl.
- How do you know?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.489
Because I did.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.848
It's the only way to get you out of here.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.006
Make me a vampire.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.681
I'll save you. We'll run away together.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.885
Don't you wanna be with me?

17:37.040 --> 17:40.169
- More than anything in this world.
- Then I'm ready.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.202
Dr. Whitmore's back. You need to hurry.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.326
Come closer.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.001
Take my hand.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.562
Leave, Maggie.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.889
Leave and never come back.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.761
And when you go, forget I ever existed.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.768
Forget that I love you.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.571
Wait.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.370
Must have fallen from your wrist.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.605
Sorry.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.963
Where were we, then?

18:58.560 --> 18:59.971
Stop. You made your point.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.770
Sorry, what was that?
I couldn't hear you over all the:

19:09.840 --> 19:12.810
Oh, I'm sorry. ls there a more appropriate
reaction to torture?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.049
I thought I was doing you
some favor by teaching you magic...

19:16.200 --> 19:19.409
- ...and you're more powerful than I ever was.
- It's nothing personal.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.006
It was our job to protect
the doppelgangers.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.400
You were an easy in.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.211
The stuff you were teaching me,
I learned in first grade.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.806
Does your coven know the Other Side
is falling apart?

19:28.960 --> 19:31.008
Why?
Scared you're not gonna make it to finals?

19:31.160 --> 19:33.686
It's not about me. I have friends there.

19:33.840 --> 19:38.004
My grams. There's gotta be something that can be done.
A spell, a ritual, something.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.160
I used to scream too.

19:44.960 --> 19:48.328
For me, it wasn't so much the sharp
instruments as it was the fingers.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.642
All those bloody fingers.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.288
Like I was a bowl of dough.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.602
Well, this is depressing.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.809
Is stadium seating really necessary?

20:02.560 --> 20:04.528
These people are starting to creep me out.

20:04.720 --> 20:08.486
If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a
veiled attempt to get me to release hostages.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.160
I'm sorry. Was that veiled?
Release the damn hostages.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.731
Whose side are you on?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.041
There are sides now?

20:14.200 --> 20:17.488
You were there with me in Augustine.
Don't tell me you've forgotten...

20:17.640 --> 20:21.087
what it was like to cling to the thing
that kept you from feeling pain.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.691
Enzo, I get it.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.049
The prospect of seeing Maggie
was your safety line to the world...

20:26.240 --> 20:30.211
the one thing that kept you
from shutting it off. But she's gone.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.647
There's a chapter
in Elena's Psych book about it.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.928
What are you two, study buddies now?

20:35.080 --> 20:36.201
<i>What are you doing?</i>

20:41.360 --> 20:46.400
The thing is, I didn't know
she was your Maggie.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.006
What are you talking about?

20:52.360 --> 20:55.569
She didn't tell me her name when we met.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.529
When exactly was that?

20:59.400 --> 21:02.290
November 8th, 1960.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.522
<i>- Hi.
- I'd gotten</i> a <i>message at the house...</i>

21:07.680 --> 21:09.887
<i>saying a lady
wanted to buy me a drink.</i>

21:10.280 --> 21:11.611
<i>Naturally, I was curious.</i>

21:11.760 --> 21:15.446
<i>One of the closest presidential
races in the history of these United States...</i>

21:15.600 --> 21:17.762
<i>rests in the hands
of our American populace.</i>

21:17.960 --> 21:20.531
I'd like to interview you
for an article I'm writing.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.921
Oh, yeah? What are you thinking?
<i>Life</i> magazine?

21:23.080 --> 21:27.165
<i>Heh. Not quite. I'm with
the Whitmore College Alumni Gazette.</i>

21:27.320 --> 21:30.529
- Where is my cigarette lighter?
- Whitmore.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.563
Spent a lot of time there.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.530
Oh. Then you remember the fire of '58.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.722
At Whitmore House?

21:37.880 --> 21:38.927
Vividly.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.521
It was incredibly hot.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.085
Very loud, lots of screaming.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.084
- Mm.
- So I heard.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.011
I'm afraid that's a little glib
to quote for the Gazette...

21:49.240 --> 21:51.402
seeing as over a dozen people died.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.767
Sensitive readership. Got you.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.289
See, I have this switch in my brain...

21:56.440 --> 21:59.011
feel something I don't wanna feel...

21:59.160 --> 22:01.401
- ...click, it's gone.
- Heh.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.164
- Easy as pie.
- Mm.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.404
You really are a monster.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.248
I'm not a fan of needles.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.448
Oh, an Augustine.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.722
How refreshing of you to find me.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.803
I usually have to hunt you people down.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.528
And the celebrations can begin.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.080
<i>DAMON'. Had she got me with
that vervain injection...</i>

22:47.200 --> 22:49.726
<i>things would have been very different.</i>

22:50.400 --> 22:52.846
<i>She didn't stand a chance against me.</i>

22:53.320 --> 22:56.244
And you made it look like I did it?

22:56.400 --> 22:58.801
Maggie was the hope Enzo clung to,
you were mine...

22:58.960 --> 23:02.009
and when you didn't notice
that I was missing for five years...

23:02.160 --> 23:03.810
let's just say I held a grudge.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.004
You killed Maggie.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.171
I didn't even bat an eye.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.691
My switch was off, Enzo,
I did a lot of terrible things.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.923
But I didn't do it to make your
life miserable from every angle...

23:17.120 --> 23:18.804
I did it because I didn't care.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.247
So do what you gotta do,
you wanna kill me...

23:21.400 --> 23:24.847
you wanna hate me, do it,
but this is between us.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.200
Well, that's the problem, Damon.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.124
I don't wanna hate you.

23:30.320 --> 23:34.041
Because if I hate you
then I have nothing left.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.883
There is another option.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.688
<i>Forget that I love you.</i>

23:47.840 --> 23:50.889
<i>DAMON'. In order for me to save myself
and leave you...</i>

23:51.760 --> 23:54.889
<i>I had to shutoff my humanity,
damn it. So I flipped the switch.</i>

23:55.040 --> 23:58.567
<i>And I felt nothing. No remorse, no regret.</i>

23:58.720 --> 23:59.767
No pain.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.007
Don't you dare. Hey, Enzo!

24:08.720 --> 24:10.449
There we are.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.922
You're right. I don't
have a care in the world.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.687
How are you feeling?

24:41.360 --> 24:44.011
- The lights...
- All part of your transition.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.410
Vampirism originated
from the magic of witches.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.244
And it is in the prophecy...

24:54.640 --> 24:58.042
that the blood of the final two
doppelgangers will undo witch magic.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.608
The last of our doppelganger blood.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.161
This is fun, not caring.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.329
Yep. Emotion-free, bye-bye humanity.

26:00.120 --> 26:05.570
To Maggie James, for whom I feel
absolute and blissful detachment.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.326
Let's get out of here.
Where is it you wanted to go?

26:08.480 --> 26:11.404
- Cape Town?
- Cape Horn.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.125
Even better.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.841
Ah. All right.
Everyone's free to go.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.847
Shaw's over.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.004
Don't worry, I compelled you all to
think you spent the day studying...

26:26.160 --> 26:29.130
like the good students you are.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.125
Except you. Stay.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.561
I wanna test something.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.327
No!

26:44.640 --> 26:47.484
Look at that. I don't even feel
obliged to say thank you.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.201
- Bastard. He took Elena.
- Let's go.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.691
No! Hey, Stefan.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.644
You deal with her,
I'll find Enzo.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.451
He's gonna kill her,
you know that, right?

27:07.680 --> 27:09.364
- I can handle him.
- Damon!

27:09.560 --> 27:13.201
- I said I could handle him.
- He wants to hurt you in any way he can.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.688
You can't save him.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.006
The witch is dying.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.482
- Drink.
- Come on, Liv, you're okay.

27:33.640 --> 27:34.721
You're okay.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.400
- You got this?
- Yeah, go.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.690
Enzo, I need you to come find me, okay?

27:42.840 --> 27:46.890
I will give you a first class ticket to Cape
wherever-it-is. I'll even come with you.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.048
Let's face it, no one's gonna miss me.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.562
But don't hurt Elena.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.165
Okay?

27:53.320 --> 27:56.449
You leave her alone, I swear
I'll never ask you for anything again.

28:02.720 --> 28:06.202
- if you were gonna kill me, I'd be dead.
- I think you mean when I kill you.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.566
I know how you're feeling.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.121
- That's the point, I feel nothing.
- You're just lost.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.727
You think cutting all this
out of your life is the answer?

28:17.920 --> 28:20.400
You're just biding time
until it comes crashing back.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.927
I know why Damon
doesn't wanna deal with you.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.127
You don't shut up.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.327
Hey.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.161
Stefan. Where's your big brother?

28:46.320 --> 28:49.164
I don't know. Guess I found you first.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.647
Ouch.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.047
Hope it's insured.

29:24.160 --> 29:28.563
- Can you call my brother, see if he's okay?
- It's already done. He's fine.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.524
So you're probably gonna get fired.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.651
Probably.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.569
You asked if there was anything
you could do about the Other Side.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.764
Did you think of something?

29:44.680 --> 29:46.728
Say goodbye to your friends, Bonnie.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.241
The Other Side's just like any other spell.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.610
You know how that works.

29:54.280 --> 29:57.966
Just like any other recipe
or math equation...

29:58.160 --> 30:01.767
remove one component,
and the whole thing implodes on itself.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.449
When those Travelers let Markos escape...

30:08.040 --> 30:11.886
But there's always another spell,
a loop hole, a sacrifice...

30:12.240 --> 30:13.401
Something.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.805
Jeremy loves you, Bonnie.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.921
He deserves to know you're leaving.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.240
Elena!

30:31.240 --> 30:33.447
Elena. Aah.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.285
You're okay.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.845
Bet you wish you'd murdered me
back when you had the chance.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.968
Though Damon would have been furious.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.441
I think it's time we both
stopped coddling him.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.771
Now, where is my lighter?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.963
Maggie's lighter, I should say.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.163
I wonder what she'd think of all this.

31:18.320 --> 31:23.281
Who knows what lies in the great beyond
for a mere human like Maggie James?

31:23.560 --> 31:27.167
Probably nothing. It's probably
just as well she isn't watching this.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.848
I believe it might upset her.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.968
Shall we burn together, you and I?

31:35.360 --> 31:37.283
Perhaps just you.

31:40.640 --> 31:44.531
My brother, he sees something good in you.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.525
And you? Isn't there a part of you
that thinks I can be redeemed?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.847
Not with your emotions off.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.929
You won't stop until you kill Damon.

31:58.320 --> 32:01.767
Better yet, wouldn't it be
a sweet piece of revenge...

32:01.920 --> 32:04.571
when Damon finds out
you killed his best friend?

32:07.200 --> 32:09.407
Have fun sorting this
out with your brother.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.042
Enzo, I need you to come find me, okay?

33:35.160 --> 33:36.241
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.407
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

33:42.560 --> 33:44.847
I'm still a bit confused
about how I got here.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.922
- Bonnie here?
- No, she never came back.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.690
Enzo's dead.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.127
Did you...?

33:55.280 --> 33:56.805
Yeah.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.920
Does Damon know?

34:05.040 --> 34:07.964
I basically just killed
my brother's only friend.

34:09.719 --> 34:11.927
It's been a tough year for Damon.

34:12.560 --> 34:17.646
Don't you think it'd be easier if No
Humanity Enzo just left for parts unknown...

34:18.920 --> 34:20.809
and was never heard from again?

34:23.120 --> 34:24.963
- Stefan, I don't know if I can...
- Listen.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.606
Damon thinks that Enzo left town.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.770
And we need to keep it that way.

34:30.719 --> 34:35.567
We barely just got him back.
This would destroy him.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.090
Please.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.609
We think Tyler's with the Travelers.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.485
And we're stuck here because Damon said
he'd twist off our kneecaps if we left.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.525
Thanks.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.161
- You mind if I talk to Jeremy for a sec?
- No.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.761
- I'm glad you're okay, Bon.
- Thanks.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.771
- Okay. You've got your super-serious face on.
- Do I?

35:05.200 --> 35:10.445
- In light of the Tyler thing, it's probably nothing.
- Bon, come on. What is it?

35:10.600 --> 35:14.764
This whole thing with the Other Side,
I don't know what's going on.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.443
But if it does go away...

35:21.200 --> 35:23.680
Liv thinks there might be a way
to save me, so...

35:25.480 --> 35:27.130
Yeah, heh.

35:27.280 --> 35:30.363
Whew, sorry. Hang on, it's Stefan.
Hello?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.846
Who are you with right now?

35:32.880 --> 35:34.689
Jeremy. Why?

35:35.360 --> 35:40.048
Because Enzo's dead, and I don't mean to
put this on you, but Damon can't find out.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.727
- Bonnie?
- Yep, I understand.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.211
Damage control, is it?

35:51.080 --> 35:52.241
Bonnie, what's going on?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.721
Nothing. Just someone passing
to the Other Side.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.888
Probably a werewolf or something.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.562
Go on. Keep your little secret.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.251
You'll see me again.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.081
Did I mention how good I am at revenge?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.291
The moment of truth.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.250
Are you still a vampire?

36:30.680 --> 36:32.284
Or is the prophecy true?

36:32.880 --> 36:36.601
Did the doppelganger blood
revert you back to your human form?

36:40.040 --> 36:41.610
I'm not healing.

36:44.880 --> 36:47.247
I'm not a vampire anymore.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.249
Congratulations.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.886
If we can undo the magic in Mystic Falls...

36:57.040 --> 37:00.840
we can undo the witch's curse
that prevents us from finding a home.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.963
We'll finally have a place to settle.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.605
Sadly, I'm afraid you won't be able
to enjoy it with us.

37:15.440 --> 37:18.603
The doppelganger blood removes magic.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.288
Unfortunately, without the magic
of vampirism to keep her alive...

37:23.440 --> 37:26.125
Sloan has reverted
to her final human state.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.965
- So now, she's just...
- Dead.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.845
Exactly, Julian.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.525
She's dead.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.968
Such is the fate of any vampire
that tries to live in our new home.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.803
We're almost ready to begin our work.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.485
Except...

37:43.640 --> 37:46.007
we're gonna need a lot more blood.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.770
I know.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.045
I know what you're thinking.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.125
I screwed up.

38:06.720 --> 38:10.725
I'm the reason Enzo's in our lives, I'm the
reason he wants us dead. It's all my fault.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.888
And I'll fix it, okay?

38:13.040 --> 38:16.362
He was there for me at my worst,
I'll find a way to be there for him.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.050
I'll get him back.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.201
I'll fix it.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.922
Did I leave anything out?

38:31.440 --> 38:35.081
I, uh, checked in on
Elena, she's all right.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.321
Yeah, I know.

38:36.480 --> 38:40.007
I found her on campus, she was unconscious.
I took her home, tucked her in.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.366
You didn't leave a note?

38:41.520 --> 38:44.524
I think I'm past trying to earn points
for good behavior, Stefan.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.767
You know, what happened today
wasn't your fault.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.003
That's very noble of you, brother.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.170
We both know that's not the truth.

38:55.320 --> 38:58.164
Well, either way, I think it's time
you leave Enzo alone.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.207
Can't.

39:00.360 --> 39:01.885
Come on, Damon.

39:02.520 --> 39:06.047
- He's not your responsibility.
- You're the only one who gets to play hero?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.769
Or you just don't think I can do it?

39:08.920 --> 39:12.083
I think that he's not worth saving.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.721
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.370
Yeah. Know what you never knew?

39:16.520 --> 39:20.002
When I was in that cell, every time
I'd say something terrible about you...

39:20.160 --> 39:24.404
or blame you for not coming to rescue me,
Enzo would bring me back from the edge.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.603
- I know you guys were close...
- Enzo reminded me...

39:29.800 --> 39:32.724
that at least I grew up with a family,
had family out there.

39:32.880 --> 39:35.247
Which was more
than he could say for himself.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.531
Said he envied me for having a brother.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.881
Even a crappy one like me?

39:45.640 --> 39:47.802
Even a crappy one like you.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.326
He defended you.
Even though he didn't know you.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.324
Said it was good
we had people outside.

39:57.520 --> 40:01.161
People just living their lives,
free and clear of our Augustine hell.

40:02.960 --> 40:06.169
People worth holding on
to our humanity for.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.163
Because we love them.

40:11.040 --> 40:14.249
All that time as a prisoner,
every time I wanted to give up on you...

40:14.400 --> 40:16.687
Enzo stopped me from hating you.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.604
And that's why I have to help him.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.090
And I owe him for that.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.446
And so do you.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.086
It's too late to make amends, Damon.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.646
You know me.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.367
Never let go of a good vendetta.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.647
And this one is just getting started.
