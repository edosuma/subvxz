55:56.686 --> 55:59.105
OBIE: That's what I'm saying,
with all this beautiful food
in front of us,

55:59.189 --> 56:01.024
all these places to eat,
you guys wanna go shopping?

56:01.107 --> 56:03.109
- AUDREY: No, but--
- OBIE: I mean, you can shop
in New York.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.195
We're staying
at the Fendi Suites, bro.

56:05.278 --> 56:06.529
There's different things
in Italy. Are you crazy?
You know that.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.157
Don't play dumb. Why do boys
always try to do that?

56:09.240 --> 56:10.533
I don't--
I'm just saying, guys...

56:10.950 --> 56:12.535
<i>Grazie.</i>

56:13.369 --> 56:14.370
Once we get back to New Y--

56:14.454 --> 56:15.622
Did you land
any new tricks lately?

56:15.705 --> 56:17.123
- No, baby! Stop it!
- (AKI LAUGHS)

56:17.207 --> 56:20.293
- Now, you look happy.
- Well, a boy asked me out.

56:20.376 --> 56:22.629
A boy who knows
who Tom Stoppard is.

56:22.712 --> 56:24.297
Oh, he's definitely
got one on us.

56:24.380 --> 56:25.673
You know what?
I met a new friend today too.

56:25.757 --> 56:27.133
Funny, so did I.

56:27.217 --> 56:29.385
This really
sweet guy's boyfriend

56:29.469 --> 56:30.887
just dumped him out of nowhere.

56:30.970 --> 56:32.639
Well, seems like it's been
a very eventful day

56:32.722 --> 56:34.641
- for all of us.
- With more to come.

56:34.724 --> 56:37.769
And on that note...
here's to our future...

56:38.603 --> 56:40.105
and a Gossip Girl-free
existence.

56:40.188 --> 56:42.982
May she rest in pieces,
having given us back our peace.

56:43.066 --> 56:44.734
- (SIGHS)
- Cheers.

56:44.818 --> 56:47.153
- Yeah.
- AUDREY: Like, period!

56:47.237 --> 56:49.614
OBIE: My Lord, it just feels
like I've been reborn,

56:49.697 --> 56:50.782
you know what I mean?

56:51.908 --> 56:55.620
♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

59:13.633 --> 59:16.261
♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪

59:16.344 --> 59:18.638
All right, uh, leave us.
Um, leave us.

59:19.555 --> 59:21.891
<i>- Oui, monsieur.</i>
- (CLEARS THROAT)

59:24.769 --> 59:25.770
Uh...

59:26.771 --> 59:32.777
So... you were a teacher
at my son's school.

59:32.860 --> 59:36.531
And then you quit
because of Gossip Girl?

59:37.865 --> 59:41.744
You flew me all the way
to Europe to meet you at dawn

59:41.828 --> 59:43.579
and talk about Gossip Girl?

59:44.247 --> 59:44.580
All right, tell me.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.042
(CHUCKLES)
Did you quit because of her

59:48.126 --> 59:49.502
or because you were her?

59:50.670 --> 59:54.048
- Excuse me?
- Oh, it's all right. I know.

59:54.132 --> 59:56.175
I know all about
that Kate person.

59:56.259 --> 59:59.095
And I also know
that she didn't act alone.

59:59.178 --> 1:00:00.972
Oh, God. Of course you know.
You know everything.

1:00:01.055 --> 1:00:02.724
ROGER MENZIES:
Calm down, Mr. Glassberg.

1:00:02.807 --> 1:00:04.517
I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna hire you.

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:10.481
I want to expand Gossip Girl.

1:00:10.565 --> 1:00:13.359
Uh, sh-- shouldn't you be
talking to Kate?

1:00:13.443 --> 1:00:17.071
No, no. Kate made it
too personal.

1:00:17.155 --> 1:00:20.199
She was on a mission.
But you did it for love.

1:00:21.117 --> 1:00:25.163
And I bet you love money, huh?
(LAUGHS)

1:00:25.246 --> 1:00:26.622
You see, Gossip Girl,

1:00:26.706 --> 1:00:28.750
it shouldn't be just one person.
It-- It-- It...

1:00:30.626 --> 1:00:34.047
It should be everybody,
in the palm of your hand,

1:00:34.130 --> 1:00:36.132
at any moment,
in any part of the world.

1:00:36.215 --> 1:00:39.302
And all ad-supported.

1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:41.679
You wanna make
Gossip Girl an app?

1:00:41.763 --> 1:00:44.307
No, not an app. The app.

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:45.516
Imagine.

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:48.394
All the teenagers
all over the world,

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:52.190
spying on each other. (LAUGHS)

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:56.277
We'll make so much money...

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:59.238
you'll never have to pick
a fingernail out of a keyboard

1:00:59.322 --> 1:01:00.531
ever again.

1:01:01.449 --> 1:01:04.619
I'm offering you
a piece, Mr. Glassberg.

1:01:04.702 --> 1:01:05.661
A piece of the future.

1:01:09.082 --> 1:01:10.458
What do you say?
