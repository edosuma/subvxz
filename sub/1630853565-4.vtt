00:08.091 --> 00:10.343
You're sure this is still
the way you wanna go?

00:10.427 --> 00:12.721
I don't know
that it's really trending anymore.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.849
Well, my dad says it's very big
with the kids on the TikTok.

00:16.433 --> 00:21.312
Okay. Well, nobody knows about social
more than older people, so… cool!

00:21.396 --> 00:22.230
-All right.
-Okay.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.148
So let's, uh…

00:23.231 --> 00:26.359
Let's go three, two, one.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.822
-Go! Go! Go!

00:30.905 --> 00:32.949
-Go! Go!

00:33.033 --> 00:34.242
-Go! Go!

00:35.535 --> 00:37.412
-God! God! God!

00:37.495 --> 00:38.663
-God!

00:38.747 --> 00:40.749
-God! God!

00:40.832 --> 00:42.917
-Go! Go!

00:43.001 --> 00:44.544
-Who's next?

00:44.627 --> 00:45.962
-God's next!

00:56.973 --> 00:58.516
-Clark…
-<i>God's next!</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:00.018
-…dancing on TikTok.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.270
-Thoughts?
-What?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.522
It occurs to me you don't know

01:04.606 --> 01:07.150
why I called this,
the first meeting of the Council of Clark.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.779
I'm definitely wondering why
you got us both to stay here so late.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.198
And what's the Council of Clark?

01:13.281 --> 01:14.365
Well, it's us.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.577
No. I'm sure I wouldn't join
a group called the Council of Clark.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.578
I definitely wouldn't.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.747
Let's not argue
about the name of the council,

01:20.830 --> 01:21.956
which has a kick-ass,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.292
-indelible, memorable name that--
-Oh gosh!

01:24.375 --> 01:26.503
Tom-othy!

01:27.128 --> 01:30.799
Right now, I'm imagining
a very big glass of red wine.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.342
-Mm.
-Give me one compelling reason

01:32.425 --> 01:36.262
why I shouldn't run awayfrom you,
towards a glass of <i>rojo</i>

01:36.346 --> 01:38.515
with a decent price point
and plenty of attitude.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.557
Okay. You wish.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.561
Because I'm seeing
some major red flags here. Think about it.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.522
I mean, he leaves the office

01:45.605 --> 01:48.108
for long hours with Amily
doing God knows what.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.734
He's keeping information from us.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.404
What is it specifically that you think
he is withholding from us?

01:53.905 --> 01:55.281
-Isn't it obvious?
-No.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.784
Clark is pathologically honest.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.620
Remember the time he found
that ten-dollar bill on the ground?

02:00.703 --> 02:04.582
Then he spent $7 printing out
little signs to see who'd claim it.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.001
Six people claimed it,
and he gave them all $10.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.255
-Finding that $10 bill cost him $67.
-Precisely.

02:10.338 --> 02:15.051
But you know, if he found ten
and then spent sev-- and then…

02:15.552 --> 02:17.512
It-- I dispute that number.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.098
I move to disband this Council of Clark.

02:20.181 --> 02:25.562
And if it's okay, I'd love to join you
for a reasonably priced glass of ro-yo.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.313
<i>Rojo.</i> But yeah, yeah. Sure, let's go.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.898
-Yeah!
-No, no, no, no. Motion denied.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.942
Um, guys, the council will stand.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.153
No, it's not a thing.
That name, it grates.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.904
-I don't like it. It's not a thing.
-Wait--

02:34.988 --> 02:36.865
We'll stand the test of time.
We're rock solid.

02:36.948 --> 02:37.949
-Bye-bye!
-Guys, uh--

02:38.032 --> 02:40.410
Forget about the name,
which is the Council of Clark--

02:40.493 --> 02:43.121
When I say "forget about the name,"
I mean I've already named it.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.665
You don't have to do anything.
There's merch on the way

02:45.748 --> 02:48.084
with that name on it
coming in your sizes each.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.586
Guys, I'm worried about Clark!

02:49.669 --> 02:51.963
If he's holding out on us,
we can't help him.

02:52.046 --> 02:55.383
Tom, I am pretty sure
Clark wouldn't keep secrets from us,

02:55.466 --> 02:57.093
-especially if it was something bad.
-Mm.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.463
I am standing outside the home

03:33.546 --> 03:37.217
of Clark Thompson,
known as the man who glows.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.221
Who would have thought we would find
a story that continues to grow nationally?

03:41.304 --> 03:45.975
The story of an incredibly
average man turned prophet,

03:46.059 --> 03:49.979
and who is seemingly
splitting popular opinion in half.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.942
know things are crazy out there,
but look on the bright side.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.861
You make great guacamole.
You make such great guacamole,

03:56.945 --> 03:58.696
and then you could sell it.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.616
And this one's for free…
You could call it "Holy Guacamole."

04:01.699 --> 04:03.785
That's a good one. I like that.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.371
Um, hey. Do you know, um,

04:07.330 --> 04:08.623
I was thinking about something…

04:08.706 --> 04:09.916
Janet Jackson?

04:09.999 --> 04:12.627
Like, where has she been
for, what, six, seven, eight years?

04:12.710 --> 04:13.544
Me too!

04:25.306 --> 04:28.518
Hey, hey!

04:28.601 --> 04:29.769
Are you here to see Clark too?

04:29.852 --> 04:32.480
-Isn't he amazing?

04:35.733 --> 04:37.402
God, you're so tense.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.238
-You gotta relax.
-Sure.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.115
This shitty couch.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.826
My mom got it for me.
She says, "Comfort is for the weak."

04:44.909 --> 04:45.952
Christ.

04:46.035 --> 04:49.664
It's just hard to relax
because Satan wants to, I guess, kill me?

04:49.747 --> 04:50.915
Yeah.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.168
-Well, everybody's into you, right?
-Right.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.378
And look at this.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.382
Chip and a dip. It's a snack-tivity.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.759
But I'm willing to share.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.220
Thank you.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.057
Oh! Fingers in, fingers out.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.351
Fingers in, fingers… Maybe.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.104
You got a lot. You like that?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.775
You know what you have to stop doing?

05:18.318 --> 05:21.321
You have to stop thinking
that the whole world is about to end.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.033
Satan's here, bitches.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.078
What was that?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.621
-I don't know.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.793
What's so funny, idiot?

05:35.877 --> 05:38.755
I could've told you
you can't get inside his house.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.007
-Huh. How?

05:41.090 --> 05:44.635
'Cause I used my powers to make it
so you can't open it. That's how.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.055
Who do you think you are,
Harry fuckin' Potter?

05:47.138 --> 05:49.807
Oh, this is nothing like Harry Potter.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.601
Honestly, it's very similar
to Harry Potter,

05:51.684 --> 05:52.894
but it's purely coincidental.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.729
Oh, Amily, Clark.

05:54.812 --> 05:58.399
Uh, this is Satan. Satan, Amily, Clark.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.526
Uh, gimme a sec with these two.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.029
-No!

06:03.112 --> 06:04.989
-Oh my God!
-Sorry, can't hear you.

06:05.615 --> 06:10.119
Don't trust her. She can't hurt you
while you're inside the threshold.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.996
Okay? You're also safe at your office.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.791
If you stay on the sidewalk
and go directly to and from work

06:14.874 --> 06:17.085
on the paths you normally take,
you should be fine.

06:17.168 --> 06:20.254
We Harry Pottered your normal routes too,
so as long as you're in travel mode

06:20.338 --> 06:22.215
from place to place, you're fine.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.343
-Every time I see you…
-Sorry it gets so technical.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.386
I blame Frisbee!

06:26.469 --> 06:30.223
Why can't you Harry Potter the world,
and then we're safe everywhere?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.475
Doesn't work like that. Wait for it.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.269
-And I hate your stupid face!

06:35.353 --> 06:39.399
Just so you know, I will protect these
two fine people until my dying breath.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.317
I will never leave their side.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.780
Sorry, guys, I have to go.
The boss needs me. It's urgent.

06:45.863 --> 06:49.617
Don't do anything she says.
She's evil, and she wants to kill you.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.035
-Wait, wait! You can't go!
-No!

06:51.119 --> 06:52.703
-Not right now!
-You can't… leave us.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.080
-Hi.

06:54.622 --> 06:58.501
I really think we might've
gotten off on the wrong foot.

06:58.584 --> 07:03.798
How about, I don't know, maybe I just
come in for a quick glass of white wine

07:03.881 --> 07:07.051
-and we could just talk this through?
-No.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.846
-Why not?
-Because you're Satan,

07:09.929 --> 07:11.931
and I don't drink carrot juice.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.808
She doesn't like white wine.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.601
God.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.313
You guys, I have to tell you something.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.734
I don't think it's fair.
I just feel like I get a bad rap.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.238
I mean, actually, demons as a whole are,
like, maligned but…

07:27.947 --> 07:31.117
Look, yes, yes, truth.

07:31.868 --> 07:37.206
There is a battle. There is a struggle
between Lucifer and God

07:37.290 --> 07:39.125
for the Kingdom of Heaven.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.045
But all Lucifer wants to do
is just make everything more fun.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.089
God's boring.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.507
I mean…

07:47.383 --> 07:49.510
Things right now are… Ugh!

07:49.594 --> 07:52.722
They're going pretty amazing,
and we wouldn't wanna mess that up.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.893
I mean, if every year could be 2020!

07:56.976 --> 07:57.935
Sing!

07:59.854 --> 08:06.819
So, what I would love,
we would love, our side would love

08:07.361 --> 08:08.863
is if, Clark, you could

08:09.655 --> 08:10.907
maybe help us?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.367
What do you say?

08:13.451 --> 08:17.121
I mean, I could really
make it worth your while.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.499
I could give you stuff.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.875
Like what?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.503
-Oh, like…

08:27.048 --> 08:28.883
Oh!

08:28.966 --> 08:29.884
Ooh!

08:29.967 --> 08:31.511
-Oh, this feels wrong.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.095
Uh-uh-uh!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.597
Just because it's wrong

08:35.389 --> 08:36.807
doesn't make it bad.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.186
Bad!

08:40.269 --> 08:42.688
I like her. I like you.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.775
Oh! It's because your foot's over
the threshold. That's why.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.694
-Oh my God.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.780
What is goin' on?

08:51.489 --> 08:52.532
-You know what?

08:52.615 --> 08:53.908
I think I'm just gonna go ahead

08:53.991 --> 08:56.035
-and ask you to leave my porch.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.453
No.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.996
Okay, I banish…

08:59.080 --> 09:00.581
-Oh.
-…thee.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.583
-Banishment.
-I hereby banish thee.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.502
Ooh. Away!

09:04.585 --> 09:06.712
Oh. Know what I think?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.465
You're not smart enough

09:10.383 --> 09:11.551
to do God's will.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.221
-And I think… you know that.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.724
Ooh!
I gotta go join the battle up there.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.644
But I will be back soon to kill you.

09:22.144 --> 09:27.149
So fuck you, fuck you,
and fuck your precious lemon tree.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.068
Toodles!

09:31.529 --> 09:33.823
The bitch burned down your lemon tree.

09:34.782 --> 09:38.286
I don't know how you're so calm.
You seem so calm. My heart is palpitating.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.330
My pulse rate is-- it's staggering.
It's staggering.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.416
God, I don't feel anything.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.043
-Well, it would be on this--
-Oh, shit.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.963
-Okay, I'm pickin' something up.
-Good, good, good.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.506
Whew.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.135
You know, um… if it would, uh…
be of comfort to you,

09:54.218 --> 09:56.596
I-- I would be willing, you know,
to stay over again.

09:56.679 --> 10:00.182
Oh, that would be cool. I mean, for your--
I was thinking about your safety.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.059
-For safety's sake.
-Thank you.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.021
You smell that?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.772
-Smell what?

10:07.815 --> 10:09.692
Something-- It smells… My God, I think it…

10:10.318 --> 10:12.570
-I think it's coming from you.
-What?

10:12.653 --> 10:14.322
-Holy shit.
-Is something--

10:15.239 --> 10:16.741
You smell exactly like

10:16.824 --> 10:19.201
these chocolate chip cookies
my grandma used to make.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.412
-Really?

10:27.418 --> 10:32.381
My friends, Clark Thompson, or…
"the man who glows"…

10:32.465 --> 10:33.507
Huh. Yeah.

10:33.591 --> 10:37.970
He's trying to shake our faith
by being untruthful.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.056
He's trying to bamboozle us…

10:40.139 --> 10:41.849
-Liar!
-…into following him!

10:41.932 --> 10:43.684
-Yeah! The devil…

10:43.768 --> 10:44.935
Are We gonna let that happen?

10:45.019 --> 10:47.021
-No!
-Are we going to let that happen?

10:47.104 --> 10:48.439
-No!
-No, indeed!

10:48.522 --> 10:51.525
Because only those who understand God…

10:51.609 --> 10:54.612
-That's right!
-…can truly know God…

10:54.695 --> 10:56.364
-Right!
-…as we do.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.492
-Amen!
-Only the righteous…

10:59.575 --> 11:00.993
-That's right.
-…are right.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.245
-Amen.
-Let me hear you.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.665
Only the righteous are right!

11:05.748 --> 11:10.211
Now, God preaches peace,
and I preach the word of God.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.170
Preach on!

11:11.253 --> 11:15.216
But if ever there was someone
I was going to punch in the bloody face,

11:15.299 --> 11:16.842
-it would be Clark Thompson!

11:17.510 --> 11:20.638
I would knock that glow right off of him!

11:24.767 --> 11:26.727
Wait. Is this safe?

11:26.811 --> 11:30.815
Chamuel said that he Harry Pottered
all of the routes, so it should be.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.859
Hey, Clark! Only the righteous are right!

11:35.403 --> 11:36.570
You little shit!

11:37.822 --> 11:39.448
Yeah! Yeah!

11:39.532 --> 11:41.075
I hope that hurts!

11:41.158 --> 11:42.952
And you spelled "believe" wrong!

11:45.204 --> 11:46.330
Hey! Stop.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.873
-Don't even!
-Sorry!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.127
Come on. You wish!

11:52.420 --> 11:53.879
<i>Won't change my mind, Tom.</i>

11:53.963 --> 11:56.215
I'm not gonna move
your desk closer to Clark's.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.133
Why not?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.928
Because the strategic floor plan
was decided by corporate two months ago,

12:01.011 --> 12:02.763
-and I sent around a dozen emails…

12:02.847 --> 12:04.807
…confirming it with all of you

12:04.890 --> 12:06.183
to maximize productivity.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.436
You're not hearing me.
I don't care about any of that.

12:08.519 --> 12:12.273
Clark is keeping key information from me.
He knows stuff he's not saying.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.609
-I don't know anything about that.
-Well, this sucks. I want my desk moved.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.988
I'm coming back in here every day
to demand it is moved until it is.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.949
A daily huddle, just you and me?

12:22.032 --> 12:23.200
-No, what?
-I love this.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.328
-No, don't do that.
-I've got, like, 12:45 to 1:15 every day.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.747
-A half hour.
-I haven't got time.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.248
-No, no, no.
-I'll soft put this in.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.709
-Just soft.
-No, don't put it in at all. I've left.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.628
-Fridays would have to be later. 7:30.
-God, no!

12:35.171 --> 12:37.423
We can do an hour.
You've got plenty of time.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.014
Hi.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.224
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:47.308 --> 12:51.687
Hi. I was just wondering, uh, about, uh…
what you mentioned the other day?

12:52.980 --> 12:55.149
What? That I think you're nice?

12:55.232 --> 12:56.776
Yes, that. Um…

12:56.859 --> 12:59.528
And, you know, there's obviously,
uh, so many different ways

12:59.612 --> 13:02.656
that one could take that, uh… statement.

13:02.740 --> 13:07.495
I just really wanted to share
that if the world was about to end,

13:08.913 --> 13:10.414
I think you're nice.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.874
Because you are nice.

13:11.957 --> 13:16.504
And what comes after that could be
whatever comes after that, you know?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.215
It's okay that I'm so old?

13:20.341 --> 13:21.342
Yes.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.761
-Actually, hang on.
-Huh?

13:23.844 --> 13:27.306
You're not, like,
a really handsome, swole 55, are you?

13:27.389 --> 13:29.975
Uh… I'm-- I'm 37.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.268
-Yes!

13:31.352 --> 13:32.978
37 is fab!

13:33.062 --> 13:35.147
-Oh, well, good.
-Yeah, that's great.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.440
It's good.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.109
Um… So, you know…

13:39.193 --> 13:43.405
um, I'm still nowhere closer
to solving that incredibly difficult cube.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.033
The Pentagonal Dodecahedron Speed Cube.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.910
-That's the one. You know.
-Yeah.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.620
-You're so smart.
-Thank you.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.122
-I really like that.
-No. My thing's more important. I promise.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.000
That dick Frisbee
won't let me move my desk.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.753
-Let's keep it classy, Tom.
-I'm on a break, Frisbee!

13:59.296 --> 14:00.548
Something's got to be done.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.676
If I'm going to be of any use to Clark,
I need proximity.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.303
Aw! I'm gonna focus
on the positive there,

14:06.387 --> 14:08.597
which is that you wanting
to be of use to Clark

14:08.681 --> 14:11.016
is the least selfish thing
I've ever heard you say, buddy!

14:11.100 --> 14:12.977
Wait. Do you guys smell something?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.019
-Yeah.
-Mm…

14:14.103 --> 14:16.647
-My God. Smells like a vintage sailboat.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.191
-My grandmother's quilt!
-Hot Pockets.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.110
-What smells so good?
-Hi, guys! Hi.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.949
Did you just walk through
a vintage boatyard?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.200
-What?
-Oh, my gosh.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.286
-Hey, it's you.
-Wendy.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.871
-You smell like Heaven, buddy.
-What?

14:31.954 --> 14:33.080
-You guys are wrong.
-My God.

14:33.163 --> 14:35.249
-Pepperoni Hot Pockets. What's going on?
-Amily! Amily!

14:35.332 --> 14:38.043
-Oh my God! What are you doing?
-Amily! Amily! Amily!

14:38.127 --> 14:39.795
-Oh my God, all of you.
-No, it's--

14:39.879 --> 14:41.589
What is going on?
You're like feral cats.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.425
No, no, no, no, no.
You tell <i>us </i>what's going on!

14:44.508 --> 14:47.303
We're not privy to the whole picture,
and now you're smelling so good?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.262
-Yeah.
-So good.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.098
And I can't be your bodyguard
if you don't let me in.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.642
-The Council of Clark agrees.
-What's the Council of Clark?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.102
-Nothing.
-Not a thing.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.980
Okay, look, spill it. What's goin' on?

14:58.063 --> 15:00.983
-Well, if you must know, I mean, I…

15:01.066 --> 15:04.111
-Some guy threw a brick through my window.
-Crazy guy.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.571
-What?
-On the way in.

15:05.654 --> 15:08.657
And, uh, just lately,
I've been feeling a little overwhelmed.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.123
-Oh! I love Rush.

15:16.206 --> 15:19.293
-Did you play this for me?
-Uh… I'm not sure.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.836
I'm gonna go use the restroom.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.338
Cool with me. Everybody poops.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.340
-No, thank you.
-Thanks for this!

15:28.594 --> 15:29.970
I think it's a flute.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.018
Oh!

15:42.441 --> 15:44.151
Oh, come on! What ha--

15:44.234 --> 15:45.986
-What--
-No, Frisbee, get out.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.531
-You made the music turn off. Get out!
-I… just wanted to see what the fun was.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.658
All right.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.788
Tom?

15:55.871 --> 15:57.414
I need some privacy, please.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.750
Oh, no, Clark.
It's me. God.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.293
Oh, my gosh.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.878
You're not gonna faint.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.089
Come on out
and let's have a little bit of a chat.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.299
We both know you're just playing
Candy Crush in there.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.509
Your pants are still up.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.053
Okay.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.182
Hi.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.601
Um…

16:18.727 --> 16:21.397
And fo… for the record, I guess
I always figured you--

16:21.480 --> 16:22.564
you would be a woman.

16:22.648 --> 16:26.568
I come in many forms. This one is
your fourth-year nurse, Mrs. Rowbotham.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.695
Oh! I loved her.

16:28.696 --> 16:32.074
-Oh! G for God. That's so cool.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.119
Oh, you're funny. I like you.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.537
That's why I picked you, you know.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.331
Because you're sweet and simple
like pecan pie.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.875
Thank yo
. I have a mild nut allergy.

16:41.959 --> 16:42.793
No, I know.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.380
-So cool.
-Clark.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.718
I called Chamuel back because
we were in a particularly hairy portion

16:50.801 --> 16:52.261
of the battle in Heaven.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.264
Lucifer and his forces
are attacking me at this very moment

16:55.347 --> 16:57.474
in multiple places and intercosmic planes.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.184
-But aren't you here?
-Yes.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.562
The universe is like a giant baklava.

17:02.146 --> 17:06.442
Everything can happen in multiple places
and multiple timescapes.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.111
So you're saying that
you're fighting Lucifer in Heaven

17:09.194 --> 17:11.488
at the same time you're talking
to me in this men's room.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.407
Like a baklava.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.035
I'm not sure
I'm getting the baklava reference.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.995
Am I thinking of spanakopita?

17:18.078 --> 17:21.248
No, dear. The universe
is nothing like a spanakopita.

17:21.331 --> 17:25.335
Now, Clark, I came here
because I need to let you know

17:25.419 --> 17:27.629
that you have to start
getting the message out.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.506
Chamuel told you to do that, right?

17:30.507 --> 17:32.217
Yes, he did. He did.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.804
Um, and I'm sorry, I tried a few things,
but they went rather poorly.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.973
Someone threw a flashlight at my face.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.058
Hmm. Hmm.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.518
What exactly is the message
I'm supposed to get out there?

17:41.602 --> 17:43.687
Chamuel was a little light on the details.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.024
I need you to let people know
that God is real

17:47.107 --> 17:48.567
and God is good.

17:48.650 --> 17:53.030
And everybody, meaning all religions,
are actually quite right about God.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.033
Also, nobody's really wrong.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.911
I'm okay with all flavors,
unless you're full crazy train,

17:58.994 --> 18:01.413
or use my name to hurt people.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.584
So, you let everyone know that,
and then I want to know what people say.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.045
Great. I-- I can try to do that.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.046
Good.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.799
The world is at a tipping point, Clark.

18:11.882 --> 18:16.720
There's far too much bad mojo out there,
and my battery is running low.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.224
Either we get the message out
and people love one another

18:20.307 --> 18:21.934
and respect one another more,

18:22.017 --> 18:24.019
and I whoop Lucifer's ass,

18:24.728 --> 18:27.689
or we don't do that and he'll whoop mine.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.607
What?

18:29.149 --> 18:31.276
Uh, no! Can we do it the first way?

18:31.360 --> 18:34.029
If people don't really want my help
anymore, then, you know…

18:34.113 --> 18:35.572
maybe I'll stop giving it.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.367
There's not much use putting out a fire

18:38.450 --> 18:40.536
if the homeowner
keeps lighting a match, is there?

18:41.120 --> 18:41.954
Jeez.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.249
Okay, um… what's the best way
for me to get the message out?

18:47.751 --> 18:48.627
Oh, my gosh.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.631
The reporter. Of course! You sent me
a reporter, and I fled from her.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.050
And there have been
reporters around my house for weeks!

18:55.134 --> 18:59.012
If you get stuck, ask your girlfriend
for help. She's a doer.

18:59.096 --> 19:03.267
Girlfriend. You said girlfriend.
Is that a… decree?

19:03.350 --> 19:04.935
Do you fancy a Starbucks?

19:05.978 --> 19:09.648
Oh, remember, for every coffee, one glass
of water. Hydration is very important.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.025
Right, well. See you soon.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.527
Or maybe never again.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.826
That's good.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.958
-Clark, are you okay?

19:28.041 --> 19:30.043
You were in the bathroom for four hours.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.254
I kept trying to check on you,
but the door was locked.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.756
Oh, really? Well, I met God.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.718
-You met God in the bathroom?
-Yes. God gave me a Starbucks.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.469
-A Starbucks?
-Wanna try it? It's so good.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.929
-I do. Can I?
-Yes.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.515
Mm!

19:43.599 --> 19:45.392
-Oh my God, that's delicious.
-So good, right?

19:45.475 --> 19:46.685
-So good.
-Which makes sense.

19:46.768 --> 19:50.355
But the main thing God said is
I really need to talk to this reporter.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.732
So I have to call her right now.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.233
-I'm messing everything up.
-No!

19:55.652 --> 19:58.405
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, Judy. It's me, uh, Clark Thompson.</i>

19:58.488 --> 20:00.949
I was wondering if we could
do that interview, um…

20:01.033 --> 20:02.034
you know, maybe right now?

20:02.659 --> 20:05.662
I'm sort of in the middle of something.
Um, how's tomorrow morning?

20:05.746 --> 20:07.956
Tomorrow morning would be fine
for someone else,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.042
at a different time if it wasn't urgent.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.586
'Cause this is such an urgent situation,
it just--

20:12.669 --> 20:15.172
Uh, I can't express
enough how urgent the urgency is.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.091
<i>-I'm on a date right now.</i>

20:18.175 --> 20:21.386
Rudely on my cell during it.
Um, how's tomorrow morning?

20:21.470 --> 20:24.473
Okay, well, tomorrow is great,
and I want you to have fun on your date.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.476
Um… I… I definitely have tried,
officially.

20:27.559 --> 20:31.021
Um, so, uh, we'll just say I'll text you
the deets about tomorrow morning.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.856
And have a fun date. Okay, bye-bye.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.694
I'm so sorry.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.862
Who's Clark?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.615
I hope it's not competition.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.495
I'm so slow.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.581
God needs me to go fast,
and I'm going so slow.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.751
You came out and immediately
called the reporter you were supposed--

20:52.834 --> 20:54.962
You literally followed
instructions immediately.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.922
-Maybe you're right.
-Of course I'm right.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.009
Now, this is gonna sound kinda weird.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.678
-I doubt it. I mean…
-Mm-hmm.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.305
If you line 'em all up together… you know.

21:05.389 --> 21:10.519
I've just been thinking about
how precious time in this life is.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.188
So since I can't do
the thing that I'm supposed to do…

21:13.689 --> 21:16.233
You wanna spend some one-on-one time with…

21:16.817 --> 21:19.194
-How did you know that?
-Well, you're slow. I'm fast.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.447
And that is when I vowed
to never play kickball again.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.160
I have to go.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.495
W--

21:28.578 --> 21:29.913
Was it my lame kickball story?

21:29.997 --> 21:32.207
Actually, Judy, I'm just not feeling it.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.168
-You're stupid and ugly.
-What?

21:38.797 --> 21:39.756
You heard me.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.637
Wow.
This is such a beautiful spot.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.597
I know, right?

21:47.681 --> 21:48.974
I'm glad you like it.

21:49.057 --> 21:53.020
I just figured, you know, Frisbee
Harry Pottered the car, and… I mean…

21:53.520 --> 21:56.606
It's probably one of the few places we can
have kind of a chill night,

21:56.690 --> 21:57.774
just the two of us.

21:59.234 --> 22:03.363
Also, I thought we could use a nice place
where we won't get murdered by Satan.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.157
-Yeah.
-Get in the back, Clark.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.701
-Oh God! What? What's going on?
-I know. Let's go!

22:09.036 --> 22:10.912
-I'm here to save your bacon, bud.
-Oh.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.331
-What is happening?

22:12.414 --> 22:14.082
-Oh!] Whoa!

22:14.166 --> 22:16.501
-Oh, shit! Go, go, go, go!
-Satan is happening.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.253
Did you miss me?

22:22.382 --> 22:24.760
-Go! Come on, man!

22:27.888 --> 22:30.432
-Shit.
-Why is my car so slow?

22:30.515 --> 22:32.851
I don't mean
to throw anyone under the bus,

22:32.934 --> 22:35.479
but Frisbee was supposed
to Harry Potter the car.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.398
Fucking Frisbee!
If he would do some work once in a while

22:38.482 --> 22:40.442
instead of doing paperwork
about doing work,

22:40.525 --> 22:42.527
-we'd all be in better shape!
-Tell me about it.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.617
-Did you talk to the reporter?
-She was on a date.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.411
-I'm supposed to talk to her tomorrow.
-God's not gonna like that.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.289
-Shit.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.876
Why does Satan even need a gun?

22:57.959 --> 23:01.588
She doesn't. She just loves them.
I mean, she should. She invented them.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.551
But even if you get hit,
I mean, you're an angel, right?

23:06.635 --> 23:08.929
You're an archangel.
You can't-- you can't die.

23:09.012 --> 23:12.682
With a high-level demon
like Lucifer and Satan, yes, I can.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.018
-And you definitely can.
-But not Clark, right?

23:15.102 --> 23:19.189
Clark's one of the good guys. I mean,
he's literally handpicked by God.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.942
I mean, if he gets shot,
which you won't get shot, you will not,

23:22.025 --> 23:24.027
but if he did, he'd go to Heaven, right?

23:24.111 --> 23:26.071
I'm not exactly sure,
due to the restructuring,

23:26.154 --> 23:27.989
-but it's possible he'd go to Hell.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.408
-Or somewhere else entirely.
-Shit.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.495
Why do you drive an old, beat-up Volvo?

23:33.578 --> 23:35.414
It literally has
zero horsepower.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.376
We're never gonna shake her.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.462
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh God!

23:49.761 --> 23:51.555
You wrecked my bike, you dick.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.351
Fuck me.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.151
-At least we know we're safe here.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.404
-Chamuel Harry Pottered the house.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.697
I just hope he's okay.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.366
I have a strong feeling that he is okay.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.995
Hey, I thought I drank all the tequila.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.165
Can you replenish tequila now?

24:18.248 --> 24:19.416
-No.
-Oh.

24:19.499 --> 24:22.919
No, I asked my dad to get you another
bottle when he came by to fix the window.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.423
-That was really sweet of you and of him.
-Oh.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.300
He left a note.

24:28.842 --> 24:32.137
"Enjoy the new window. Look forward
to pleasuring ourselves in the sauna."

24:32.220 --> 24:33.096
"Love, Pop."

24:34.181 --> 24:35.557
Always a tough sentence.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.476
-He loves the sauna.
-Yeah.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.770
You know, I haven't had a chance
to actually tell you, um…

24:41.396 --> 24:44.149
but when I met God today,
God actually mentioned you.

24:46.860 --> 24:47.736
I don't…

24:48.653 --> 24:49.738
I'm sure that was…

24:50.947 --> 24:52.449
I can't imagine God mentioning me.

24:52.532 --> 24:56.161
Actually referred to you as my girlfriend.

24:56.244 --> 25:00.874
Which, I um… I wasn't sure if that was
something you were interested in or not.

25:00.957 --> 25:04.836
But-- but I'm sort of putting it out there
in, kind of, a soft way

25:04.920 --> 25:07.255
of, like, if you're interested
in making it official,

25:07.339 --> 25:09.424
that's something we could… but if… also…

25:09.508 --> 25:11.760
-Hmm. Yeah.
-You know, whatever.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.886
Okay, well.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.098
Is that something
you'd like to make official?

25:17.182 --> 25:20.101
Yes, I would. Yes. If…
But did I answer too quickly?

25:20.185 --> 25:22.354
'Cause I-- I can, like, give it a beat.

25:22.437 --> 25:26.525
Uh… but-- but it's not,
like, a pressure thing.

25:26.608 --> 25:30.904
It just was something that was brought up
today in kind of an unusual situation.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.197
Like, if that's something--

25:32.280 --> 25:35.158
If you're interested in it,
I'm certainly incredibly interested.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.411
-If it's not something--
-I want to make it official too.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.498
That's so cool.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.177
-My God.
-Did I do something?

25:54.719 --> 25:56.054
You're doing it again.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.475
Mm! God.
You smell just like Marco Chevrolati.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.018
He was my first boyfriend.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.688
He was a terrible kisser,
but he had great cologne.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.073
I'm sorry, Leviathan. I-- I would have…

26:15.156 --> 26:19.327
I would have gotten them, it's just that
stupid fuck-faced angel got in my way.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.912
I'll do better next time.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.458
The boss isn't gonna like this.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.378
Go.

26:31.798 --> 26:32.924
That's my bathroom.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.220
That's my other bathroom.
