00:00.267 --> 00:01.533
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.535 --> 00:03.002
<i> my best friend</i>
<i> was my grandfather.</i>

00:03.004 --> 00:04.336
<i> If there was something</i>
<i> awesome to do,</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:05.871
<i> I was gonna tackle it</i>
<i> with Pops,</i>

00:05.873 --> 00:07.873
<i> and that week,</i>
<i> that awesome thing would be</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:11.276
<i> the most hyped movie</i>
<i> of our time...</i> Batman.

00:11.278 --> 00:11.677
Pops...
Oh.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.613
I have the biggest news
in your 80-some years of life.

00:14.615 --> 00:18.851
A Batman movie's coming out,
and it's going to be awesome!

00:18.853 --> 00:19.852
Batm'n? I'm in!

00:19.854 --> 00:23.555
Me and your dad
loved the old
Adam West TV show.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.023
Didn't we, Murray?

00:24.025 --> 00:26.525
(IMITATES ADAM WEST)
It appears to me,
Commissioner Gordon,

00:26.527 --> 00:31.797
that the Joker, Riddler,
and the Catwoman
have escaped.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.198
What is that?
What is he doing?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.666
I think that's Adam West
as Batm'n.

00:34.668 --> 00:41.340
Your inability to identify
this spot-on impression
is criminal.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.209
Come on. Let's go see
Adam West on the big screen

00:44.211 --> 00:45.978
before your dad
ruins it forever!

00:45.980 --> 00:48.080
Actually, the new movie
stars Michael Keaton.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.682
The guy who plays
Beetle-Buzz?
Beetlejuice.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.251
Beetle-Jazz
can't be Batm'n.

00:52.253 --> 00:56.255
There is only one
Caped Crusader,
and that is me.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.624
Stop it!
Why is he doing
that weird voice?

00:58.626 --> 00:59.992
'Cause we're going
to see<i> Batman.</i>

00:59.994 --> 01:01.727
I've been waiting
to see that for months!

01:01.729 --> 01:04.830
I'm gonna grab my coat
and pound a couple of Jolts.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.031
I wanna make sure
I'm really wired

01:06.033 --> 01:08.033
when I yell things
back at the screen.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.669
It appears the Batcave
is all mine

01:10.671 --> 01:15.407
to watch the Bat-Television
in my Bat-Underpants.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.042
Stop it!
Come on. Let's go.

01:17.044 --> 01:20.245
To the Batmobile!
To the Bat-Recliner.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.947
Ah!

01:22.516 --> 01:23.849
Oh, man.
This is awesome.

01:23.851 --> 01:27.352
Great movie,
great seats, great snacks.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.521
Doesn't get any better
than this.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.057
Is that seat taken?

01:32.059 --> 01:33.225
Is that seat taken?

01:33.227 --> 01:34.226
(GROANS) Okay.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.894
Oh, no, it's Barry!

01:35.896 --> 01:36.662
Is that seat taken?

01:36.664 --> 01:39.198
We invited Barry
and forgot all about him.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.500
Technically,
he invited himself...
Is that seat taken?

01:41.502 --> 01:42.201
...so I feel no remorse.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.937
Yo! Can you
move your wheelchair
so I can sit there?

01:44.939 --> 01:48.640
Come on.
He's your brother.
We got to say sorry.

01:48.642 --> 01:49.775
Is that seat taken?
Do we?

01:49.777 --> 01:52.744
Is that seat taken?
I mean, everything
is so perfect right now.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.379
That seat taken?
That seat's taken, too.

01:54.381 --> 01:58.083
It's just one little "sorry."
He'll understand.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.251
What the hell?

01:59.253 --> 02:02.621
You guys ditched me,
now I'm walking around
like a schmuck,

02:02.623 --> 02:03.555
begging strangers
to move over?

02:03.557 --> 02:06.892
We were just so excited
to see the movie.
You get it.

02:06.894 --> 02:07.726
I don't get it!

02:07.728 --> 02:10.796
Where's my seat?
I think there's a couple
seats in the front row.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.565
So you expect me
to sit alone
in the front row,

02:13.567 --> 02:16.602
craning my neck up
at the giant screen
like putz-bag?

02:16.604 --> 02:17.936
You don't have to do it
like a putz-bag.

02:17.938 --> 02:22.508
No way.
It's only fair if we all sit
in the terrible front row.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.842
Pfft. How is that fair?

02:23.844 --> 02:26.445
Two words... Family.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.750
Okay, look,
the movie's about to start.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.787
Just sit up there, and...
And we'll meet up afterwards.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.054
Fine!

02:36.056 --> 02:39.558
But this is the worst thing
that anyone has ever
done to me.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.561
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:42.563 --> 02:46.999
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:48.869 --> 02:49.768
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:49.770 --> 02:53.372
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:53.374 --> 02:55.507
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was April 5th,</i>
<i> 1980-something.</i>

02:55.509 --> 02:58.277
<i> My sister's senior year</i>
<i> was cruising right along,</i>

02:58.279 --> 02:59.411
<i> until this happened.</i>

02:59.413 --> 03:00.879
Question...
What is this garbage?

03:00.881 --> 03:04.516
Oh, goodie! You got
your college interview
for Penn State!

03:04.518 --> 03:06.351
Thing is,
I didn't schedule it,

03:06.353 --> 03:06.818
and I'm not going.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.254
Carnegie Mellon is
the only school I care about.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.789
Well, you always
need a backup.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.491
That's why I always
bake two pies,

03:12.493 --> 03:14.993
in case Murray eats one
while sleepwalking.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.562
Mom, if I don't get into CMU,

03:16.564 --> 03:17.629
then I'm just gonna
skip college

03:17.631 --> 03:19.364
to busk on the street
like a true artist.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.200
So, what am I supposed
to tell people?

03:21.202 --> 03:24.036
"Oh, there's my daughter,
singing next to a hobo

03:24.038 --> 03:26.038
"who's going pishy
on another hobo."

03:26.040 --> 03:27.940
Penn State is amazing!

03:27.942 --> 03:31.376
That place made your father
everything he is today.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.544
Bevy.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.812
I lost another hot dog.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.547
What? Why does this
keep happening?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.749
I guess 'cause my, uh,
gesturing hand

03:37.751 --> 03:39.484
is also my
hot-dog-holding hand.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.286
I think my point here
is proven.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.321
Murray, your daughter thinks

03:42.323 --> 03:44.957
she's too good to go
to her Penn State interview.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.593
Let's get something straight,
little missy.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.727
Graduating from Penn State

03:48.729 --> 03:51.330
is the greatest accomplishment
of my life.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.599
Too bad, Dad. I'm going
to Carnegie Mellon.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.000
You are going
to Penn State.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.803
It is cheaper,
it's more affordable,

03:57.805 --> 03:58.604
and it costs less!

03:58.606 --> 04:00.439
That's the same thing
said three different ways!

04:00.441 --> 04:04.343
Well, if it's
good enough for me,
it's good enough for you.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.277
Okay, fine.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.211
I guess I didn't realize

04:06.213 --> 04:07.746
how important
this was to you.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.647
I promise to take

04:08.649 --> 04:10.349
my Penn State
interview seriously.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.850
ADULT ADAM:<i> By "seriously",</i>
<i> my sister meant</i>

04:11.852 --> 04:14.152
<i> "intentionally tank"</i>
<i> her Penn State interview.</i>

04:14.154 --> 04:16.121
Yo, dude!
Sorry I'm two hours late.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.889
Uh, well, three.
(CHUCKLES)

04:17.891 --> 04:19.858
No worries.
Come on in!

04:20.361 --> 04:22.794
Oh! Two points!

04:22.796 --> 04:23.762
Oh! Wow.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.198
There's not even a trash can
there. (CHUCKLES)

04:26.200 --> 04:27.099
Have a seat. (CLEARS THROAT)

04:27.101 --> 04:30.335
I'm Kyle Schnitz, and it is
very nice to meet you.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.436
My favorite part
of being an alum

04:31.438 --> 04:35.574
is getting to interview
all kinds of great students.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.541
Oh, full disclosure.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.644
I'm not so much a, uh,
great student

04:38.646 --> 04:40.345
as I am a cheater.
I'm sorry.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.014
Aw! That's a cute dog
you got there.

04:42.016 --> 04:45.450
Oh. Uh, thank you.
Yes, that's Ruffles.
He's a rescue.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.852
No, I'm talking
about your wife.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.688
Boom! Upstairs!
(CHUCKLES)

04:50.157 --> 04:52.491
Just gonna leave me
hanging like that?

04:52.493 --> 04:53.025
Lame.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.927
Let's just forge onward,
shall we? Um, so...

04:55.929 --> 04:59.131
What programs at Penn State
are you most excited to...

04:59.133 --> 05:00.799
Oh, my!
What are you doing?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.568
(MUFFLED) Taking on this
meatball sub like a champ.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.070
Want some, Kenny?
It's... Kyle.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.040
Uh, would you please
not get sauce all over my...

05:08.042 --> 05:09.708
Gah! Damn it!
That's my name placard!

05:09.710 --> 05:12.778
All right. Let me, uh,
cut to the chase here, Kyle.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.181
I am one hell of a singer.
I mean, check out these pipes.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.449
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:17.451 --> 05:21.753
<i> ¶ Kyle Schnitz</i>
<i> smells like farts</i>

05:21.755 --> 05:25.390
<i> ¶ Oh, stinky, stinky farts ¶</i>

05:25.392 --> 05:27.159
That was right off
the top of the dome.

05:27.161 --> 05:27.959
And interview over!

05:27.961 --> 05:29.461
ADULT ADAM:<i> The only thing</i>
<i> more uncomfortable</i>

05:29.463 --> 05:33.065
<i> than Erica's interview</i>
<i> was Barry's seat at the movie.</i>

05:35.469 --> 05:36.935
<i> Wait till they get</i>
<i> a load of me.</i>

05:36.937 --> 05:40.872
What's happening?
This isn't like
the TV show at all.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.541
I know!
It's so awesome!

05:42.543 --> 05:44.009
ADULT ADAM:
<i> He certainly was to me.</i>

05:44.011 --> 05:47.579
<i> But to Pops, his Batman</i>
<i> was from the old TV show.</i>

05:47.581 --> 05:48.080
This is crazy.

05:48.082 --> 05:51.083
You really think Adam West
is the better Batman?

05:51.085 --> 05:51.850
He's the only Batm'n.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.620
And this new fancy movie
forgot the best part!

05:55.622 --> 05:59.925
Where were the
"POWs" and "BAMs"
when Batm'n socks the Joker?

05:59.927 --> 06:03.028
I'm not so sure
you need to see
big cartoon words

06:03.030 --> 06:04.162
when Bat punches a dude.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.297
We'll just watch
the old show,

06:05.299 --> 06:07.065
and then you'll see
what I'm talking about.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.633
Well, no matter
which Batman is better,

06:08.635 --> 06:11.670
at least we can agree
we had an awesome day
together.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.939
(CLATTERING)

06:13.941 --> 06:17.843
What the hell?

06:17.845 --> 06:18.877
Oh, no.
Balls.

06:18.879 --> 06:19.878
Balls is right, man!

06:19.880 --> 06:22.914
Who exactly are you
talking to right now?
You!

06:22.916 --> 06:25.350
My neck is just jacked up
from sitting in the front row.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.954
We were bickering
about Batm'n,
and forgot you were up there.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.791
But this always happens!
You two do everything
without me!

06:32.793 --> 06:34.292
Well, I know
this looks bad,

06:34.294 --> 06:37.262
but we never leave you
out of the fun!

06:37.264 --> 06:38.430
(OVEN TIMER DINGS)
What was that?

06:38.432 --> 06:39.698
Nothing.
What's in the oven, dudes?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.466
Don't look in the oven,
Barry.
You better not be doing

06:41.468 --> 06:43.301
what I think you're doing.
Don't look in the oven!

06:43.303 --> 06:47.439
I'm going to the oven!
I'm looking inside!

06:47.908 --> 06:50.609
Oh, my God!

06:50.878 --> 06:55.113
You two made
Batman Shrinky Dinks...

06:55.215 --> 06:56.381
Without me?

06:56.383 --> 06:59.785
You know I live
for shrinking dinks.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.720
We know that.
Everyone knows that!

07:01.722 --> 07:04.589
There's only two
shrunken dinks, man!

07:04.591 --> 07:06.591
Not three dinks.
Just two!

07:06.593 --> 07:10.829
Yeah, 'cause it's
one dink for me
and one dink for you.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.132
Don't! Just don't.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.267
(OVEN DOOR CLOSES)

07:15.269 --> 07:17.269
You're gonna pay for this.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.771
Oh, Barry, come back.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.306
You can have my dink.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.643
You can have my dink,
Barry!

07:24.645 --> 07:25.444
BEVERLY: Murray!

07:25.446 --> 07:27.813
Your daughter has
some huge news!

07:27.815 --> 07:29.648
Erica, tell your father
all about...

07:29.650 --> 07:31.249
Okay, I can't
stand it anymore!

07:31.251 --> 07:34.085
She said she killed
in her interview... Killed!

07:34.087 --> 07:35.353
Whoo-hoo!
That's my peanut!

07:35.355 --> 07:38.356
Yep! I really
made an impression
on the Penn State guy.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.225
Like, he's never
gonna forget me.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.462
(LAUGHING) Oh, my God.
I'm so happy, I could (BLEEP)

07:43.464 --> 07:45.297
That's actually, uh,
good timing,

07:45.299 --> 07:49.234
'cause Carnegie Mellon
just sent you a letter,

07:49.236 --> 07:50.702
and it's kind of thin.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.103
Oh, no! It is thin!

07:52.105 --> 07:54.706
If they said yes,
they wouldn't send
the thin one!

07:54.708 --> 07:56.475
Wait. Maybe they, uh,
just sent a pre-letter

07:56.477 --> 07:59.110
to tell me that
the thick one's
on the way, and...

07:59.112 --> 08:01.046
Son of a bitch!

08:01.048 --> 08:02.180
I got rejected!

08:02.182 --> 08:04.316
Carnegie Mellon
rejected my baby?

08:04.318 --> 08:06.651
(SCOFFS) Well, I'm never
buying another melon!

08:06.653 --> 08:11.056
From this moment on,
this family eats
tree fruits only.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.757
No more scoopable fruits.
You hear me?

08:12.759 --> 08:15.160
Good news, though.
You got your backup.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.930
Yes! That is good news,
that I have a backup.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.533
Murray's an alum,
and you will be, too.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.268
Penn State is happening.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.936
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:24.938 --> 08:28.206
Well, um...
I have to go for, uh...

08:28.208 --> 08:30.475
For a reason
I can't think of right now,

08:30.477 --> 08:32.644
but it's real, so bye.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.414
Hey!
Oh, no! She's back.

08:36.416 --> 08:39.518
It's okay! It's me,
Erica Goldberg.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.886
Uh, yeah. I remember.

08:40.888 --> 08:45.657
I'm going to my car now,
and my secretary knows
I'm down here.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.393
Wait. No. Don't
walk away from me.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.461
Or run!

08:49.463 --> 08:50.662
Don't make me
chase you, Schnitz!

08:50.664 --> 08:52.631
Oh, God. My secretary
has no idea where I am.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.132
I slipped out to go
to my pottery class!

08:54.134 --> 08:56.735
Look, I know
I messed up my interview,

08:56.737 --> 08:57.569
but I have my reasons!

08:57.571 --> 08:59.671
I only tanked it
on purpose out of spite!

08:59.673 --> 09:01.473
That's even worse
than being crazy.

09:01.475 --> 09:02.974
I'm not crazy,
and this proves it!

09:02.976 --> 09:05.243
Look at my teacher
recommendations!
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

09:05.245 --> 09:07.445
Just look at them!
Damn it!

09:07.447 --> 09:09.915
You are nuts, lady!
And I have good SATs! Ow!

09:09.917 --> 09:12.450
I need to get a will.
And I played soccer
in the 10th grade!

09:12.452 --> 09:16.254
I was also
Model U.N. Treasurer!
(TIRES SQUEAL)

09:18.825 --> 09:19.324
I think that helped.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.360
ADULT ADAM:<i> With that,</i>
<i> Erica officially lost</i>
<i> her backup school.</i>

09:22.362 --> 09:24.629
<i> Meanwhile, Pops was</i>
<i> giving me an education</i>

09:24.631 --> 09:26.498
<i> on the old version</i>
<i> of</i> Batman.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.767
See that?
It's a camera trick.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.037
Th... They shoot it sideways.
Yeah, I got it.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.705
Now, this is Batm'n!

09:33.707 --> 09:34.739
ADULT ADAM:<i> Little did I know,</i>

09:34.741 --> 09:36.641
<i> my scorned brother</i>
<i> was lurking in the shadows</i>

09:36.643 --> 09:39.044
<i> and planning a dastardly</i>
<i> revenge plot to ensure</i>

09:39.046 --> 09:42.514
<i> that me and my grandfather</i>
<i> would never forget him again.</i>

09:42.516 --> 09:44.382
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

09:44.384 --> 09:45.850
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

09:46.787 --> 09:48.019
What?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.454
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Like the Joker himself,</i>

09:49.456 --> 09:50.322
<i> Barry set a treacherous trap</i>

09:50.324 --> 09:52.791
<i> that would destroy</i>
<i> the dynamic duo forever.</i>

09:52.793 --> 09:55.994
Adam! Come quick!
It's an emergency!

09:57.431 --> 09:59.264
Oh! Thanks
for dropping by.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.732
You said
it was an emergency.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.767
A hang-with-my-bro
emergency.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.669
Here, have a seat.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.371
No!

10:06.940 --> 10:08.440
This chair.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.177
And action...

10:12.179 --> 10:13.511
Is my favorite
movie genre.

10:13.513 --> 10:18.483
Which reminds me,
I saw you watching that
old<i> Batman</i> TV show.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.517
Pops was right.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.119
Adam West is better
than Keaton.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.655
Pops doesn't know
the first thing
about<i> Batman.</i>

10:23.657 --> 10:26.625
He doesn't even say it right.
He says "Batm'n."

10:26.627 --> 10:28.893
But you told Pops
you love his show.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.829
It kind of sounds like
you lied to his face.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.165
I had to. It's just...
It's so corny!

10:34.167 --> 10:34.966
Say it louder.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.601
I mean,
it made no sense at all.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.069
They had a bat-calendar.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.205
Move more into the light.
And bat shark repellant?

10:40.207 --> 10:44.242
Why would a superhero
even have that
on his utility belt? Why?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.878
So you don't just
reject Pops' Batman.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.514
You reject Pops
as a human old person?

10:49.516 --> 10:50.782
Nah, I'm just humoring him.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.419
All that old-timey stuff he
likes, it's just not for me.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.120
And cut.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.821
Why would you say that?
No reason.

10:56.823 --> 10:57.822
I always like our talks.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.524
Go away now.
Come on. Come on.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.660
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And with that, my brother</i>
<i> had everything he needed</i>

11:01.662 --> 11:06.564
<i> to become a villain</i>
<i> that could even rival</i>
<i> Jack Nicholson's Joker.</i>

11:06.800 --> 11:08.099
Wait till they
get a load of me.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.269
What'd you say?
Nothing! Go away now!

11:12.939 --> 11:14.706
Wait till they
get a load of...

11:14.708 --> 11:18.209
Nope. Moment's passed.
Damn it.

11:19.613 --> 11:22.881
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It had been a day since my</i>
<i> sister's Penn State disaster,</i>

11:22.883 --> 11:26.384
<i> and our parents still</i>
<i> didn't know until now.</i>

11:26.386 --> 11:27.719
Hey, folks,
no need for alarm,

11:27.721 --> 11:30.388
except for the incredibly
alarming phone call
I just got.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.391
It seems that Erica tanked
her interview with Penn State,

11:33.393 --> 11:36.227
and then attacked the man
in a parking garage.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.163
What?
What have you done,
child?

11:38.165 --> 11:38.930
It's not my fault!

11:38.932 --> 11:40.665
Dad said I had to go
to Penn State,

11:40.667 --> 11:42.667
and I wanted CMU,
and now I have nothing,

11:42.669 --> 11:45.036
and, dear Lord,
this is a disaster!

11:45.038 --> 11:46.237
Look, you folks can relax

11:46.239 --> 11:49.174
because ol' Glascott
has the solution.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.375
Good.
Thank God.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.042
I have failed
as a mother.

11:51.044 --> 11:55.180
Are any of you familiar
with the International
Correspondence School?

11:55.182 --> 11:58.049
<i> Do you want to</i>
<i> make more money?</i>
<i> Sure, we all do.</i>

11:58.051 --> 12:00.118
You may have seen
their catchy TV commercials

12:00.120 --> 12:03.021
starring America's sweetheart,
Sally Struthers.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.322
Don't.
Ooh, look!

12:04.324 --> 12:05.123
In just two short years,

12:05.125 --> 12:07.358
you can get a degree
in TV/VCR repair.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.626
But I don't want to fix TVs!

12:08.628 --> 12:10.929
Well, luckily, you have
a bunch of other options...

12:10.931 --> 12:13.364
Gun repair, child daycare,

12:13.366 --> 12:15.133
learning the personal
computer.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.435
We're seeing
the same thing you are!

12:17.437 --> 12:19.037
You don't have to
read it out loud!

12:19.039 --> 12:20.872
Interior decorating?
Cooking?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.674
Art? Air condition
and maintenance?

12:22.676 --> 12:25.076
I mean, what does this
school not have?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.845
A campus.
This is a nightmare!

12:26.847 --> 12:28.613
Okay, let's all
just take a breath.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.548
We've got one card
left to play.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.816
Murray, you're an alum.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.219
You'll go down there
and straighten this
whole mess out.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.154
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.022
What? Why not?
She made her bed,

12:38.024 --> 12:40.158
and now she's gonna
have to lie in it!

12:40.160 --> 12:42.460
Kid's got to learn.
Yeah. In college.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.929
Okay, I am not
getting involved.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.433
End of story!
Do not pry!

12:48.435 --> 12:48.933
Shh!

12:48.935 --> 12:50.468
Well, I am getting you
into Penn State.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.572
No child of mine will deal
with the consequences
of her actions!

12:54.574 --> 12:55.740
Excuse me.

12:55.742 --> 12:56.474
1-800...

12:56.476 --> 12:59.344
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica's college career</i>
<i> went up in flames,</i>

12:59.346 --> 13:01.980
<i> my plan to shoot</i>
<i> a Batman movie with Pops</i>

13:01.982 --> 13:03.414
<i> was about to be shut down.</i>

13:03.416 --> 13:04.949
Well, well, well.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.418
If it isn't Adamander
Goldberg in the flesh.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.487
Adamander?
We need to talk,
my friend.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.856
You think Adam is short
for Adamander?

13:11.858 --> 13:12.757
It's time
to pay the piper.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.460
Do you think
it's like Alexander?
Forget the name!

13:15.462 --> 13:17.262
You got other things
to worry about.

13:17.264 --> 13:17.829
ADULT ADAM:<i> Did I ever.</i>

13:17.831 --> 13:21.833
<i> At that very moment,</i>
<i> Pops would stumble upon</i>
<i> a secret recording of me</i>

13:21.835 --> 13:23.134
<i> bashing him</i>
<i> and all he held dear.</i>

13:23.136 --> 13:24.736
(ON RECORDING)
<i> Nah, I'm just humoring him.</i>

13:24.738 --> 13:27.105
<i> All that old-timey stuff</i>
<i> he likes,</i>

13:27.107 --> 13:28.339
<i> it's just not for me.</i>

13:28.341 --> 13:30.141
Oh, no.
I said awful things

13:30.143 --> 13:32.377
about his terrible version
of<i> Batman.</i>

13:32.379 --> 13:33.945
Yes you did.

13:33.947 --> 13:38.750
For once, Pops is gonna be
in my stupid home movie.

13:38.752 --> 13:40.985
"Rad:
The Barry Goldberg Story."

13:40.987 --> 13:45.523
No! You can't put that
wonderful elderly man
in a BMX movie!

13:45.525 --> 13:48.359
I don't think
you'll be stopping me.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.464
No!
You can't do this!

13:53.466 --> 13:54.899
Okay.
This isn't a problem.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.367
I'll just grab
my toolbox and...

13:56.369 --> 13:59.037
Damn it! I don't have
real-world skills.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.840
Or a utility belt
with actual utilities!

14:01.842 --> 14:04.042
Well, well, looks like you
wanted to get into Penn State

14:04.044 --> 14:06.711
a little bit more than you
thought, hmm, Miss Goldberg?

14:06.713 --> 14:10.148
She does, and we are
so, so grateful

14:10.150 --> 14:12.350
that you agreed
to meet with us today,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.986
and Erica is very sorry
for her behavior.

14:14.988 --> 14:18.423
I really am. I mean,
stalking you in the garage

14:18.425 --> 14:21.526
and singing a hurtful song
about you smelling like poots

14:21.528 --> 14:25.897
and comparing
your wife's appearance
to that of a canine...

14:25.899 --> 14:28.166
It's all very...

14:28.468 --> 14:28.867
Not good.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.502
I might also add,
she ate a sandwich on my desk.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.072
Which reminds me, you know,
I never had my lunch.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.442
Would you mind if I
rudely devoured this
and wasted your time?

14:37.444 --> 14:39.177
Okay, I deserve that.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.746
Mmm, that is very messy.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.314
All right, well,
I made my point, okay?

14:43.316 --> 14:45.350
Well, it might
interest you to know

14:45.352 --> 14:47.151
that my husband,
Murray Goldberg,

14:47.153 --> 14:50.655
is an active alum
of this school.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.156
An active alum?

14:52.158 --> 14:52.991
Active.
Damn it. Fine.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.794
Well, I'm sure we can, uh,
work something out. (CHUCKLES)

14:56.796 --> 14:58.630
Just take a look.

14:58.632 --> 15:01.833
Huh. It appears that
Mr. Goldberg is not,

15:01.835 --> 15:04.369
in fact, a graduate
of Penn State.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.104
What? How dare you!

15:06.106 --> 15:07.605
Oh, see for yourself.

15:07.607 --> 15:12.076
He's one credit shy
of graduation.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.280
I say I'd earned
a celebratory bite, hmm?

15:15.282 --> 15:16.281
(CHUCKLES)

15:16.283 --> 15:20.318
(GROANS) Oh, Schnitz!
I messed myself.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.519
I messed myself.

15:21.521 --> 15:25.657
College dropout?
I'm married to
a college dropout?

15:25.659 --> 15:26.925
You're a college dropout!

15:26.927 --> 15:29.594
I dropped out to marry you,
dropout!

15:29.596 --> 15:30.862
So this is why
you wouldn't help,

15:30.864 --> 15:32.830
because you've been lying
for three decades?

15:32.832 --> 15:36.100
I feel bad, and I say that
from the bottom of my heart

15:36.102 --> 15:38.603
and also to end
this conversation!

15:38.605 --> 15:39.304
This is nuts.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.639
You both lectured me
my entire life

15:41.641 --> 15:42.807
on how important college is,

15:42.809 --> 15:46.277
and now I find out that
neither of you even graduated?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.145
I was one credit short!

15:47.147 --> 15:51.950
You know, if I eat
99% of a sandwich,
I still at a sandwich!

15:51.952 --> 15:54.085
This isn't a sandwich!
It's my future!

15:54.087 --> 15:55.687
Look, it doesn't matter
what I did.

15:55.689 --> 15:56.654
I'm still your father,

15:56.656 --> 15:58.556
and you're not
skipping out on college.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.592
I am done taking life advice
from a hypocrite.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.494
Since none of these colleges
will take me,

16:03.496 --> 16:05.496
I am just gonna focus
on my music

16:05.498 --> 16:09.200
and busk on the streets
like a true artist!

16:09.202 --> 16:11.469
Why didn't you back me up
on the sandwich metaphor?

16:11.471 --> 16:15.039
Well, I hope you're happy.
Your daughter's a busker.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.008
We've lost her
to the streets.

16:17.010 --> 16:17.308
Busking?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.243
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica walked out</i>
<i> on her college future,</i>

16:19.245 --> 16:22.413
<i> Pops had stumbled right into</i>
<i> Barry's supervillain trap,</i>

16:22.415 --> 16:23.014
<i> and it was foolproof.</i>

16:23.016 --> 16:28.052
(SIGHS) Adam said
some pretty nasty words
about everything you love.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.621
Can't imagine what
you must be thinking
right now.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.390
I think you secretly
taped Adam

16:32.392 --> 16:35.727
in a weird attempt to turn us
against each other.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.028
How dare you, sir!

16:37.030 --> 16:39.630
You told Adam
to stand in better light.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.734
You really need to learn
how to grift someone, kiddo.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.870
If anything,
you should be angry at Adam!

16:45.872 --> 16:50.341
He's the one
who bad-mouthed you while
I happened to be filming!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.075
Yeah, where's Adam?

16:51.077 --> 16:53.277
ADULT ADAM:<i> I was trapped</i>
<i> with no way out.</i>

16:53.279 --> 16:54.879
Think, Adamander! Think!

16:54.881 --> 16:56.080
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And then I saw it.</i>

16:56.082 --> 16:58.750
<i> My sheets served</i>
<i> as my own Bat-Signal.</i>

16:58.752 --> 17:00.885
<i> Forget the Batman movie</i>
<i> and TV show.</i>

17:00.887 --> 17:04.889
<i> I'd be the greatest</i>
<i> Dark Knight</i>
<i> Gotham had ever seen!</i>

17:05.191 --> 17:07.725
I told you!
Adam's long gone!

17:07.727 --> 17:09.327
Whoa!
(THUDS)

17:09.429 --> 17:12.363
That looks so much
easier on TV!

17:13.833 --> 17:15.733
Adam, are you okay?
No!

17:15.735 --> 17:17.402
This crazy man
locked me in my room

17:17.404 --> 17:19.470
so he could make
a dirt-biking movie with you!

17:19.472 --> 17:21.372
Barry, why
would you do this?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.041
The kid could have
gotten real hurt.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.076
I just had enough.
Enough of what?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.412
Of you two
leaving me out!

17:27.647 --> 17:30.515
All my life, you guys
have been the dynamic duo...

17:30.517 --> 17:33.918
Having fun,
making awesome movies...

17:33.920 --> 17:37.255
Did it ever occur to you,
just once, maybe
I'd like to be included?

17:37.257 --> 17:41.225
Barry, you're
my grandson, too.
You know I love you.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.461
It doesn't
feel like that, Pops.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.435
ADULT ADAM:<i> With her</i>
<i> college dreams dashed,</i>

17:50.437 --> 17:52.403
<i> Erica would busk her way</i>
<i> to fame and fortune.</i>

17:52.405 --> 17:55.206
<i> Naturally, she'd rely on</i>
<i> the greatest song of the '80s.</i>

17:55.208 --> 17:59.811
<i> ¶ Gonna take a lot</i>
<i> to take me away from you</i>

17:59.813 --> 18:03.314
<i> ¶ There's nothing that</i>
<i> a hundred men or more...</i>

18:03.316 --> 18:04.649
(GASPS)

18:04.651 --> 18:05.583
Gah! Gross!

18:05.585 --> 18:09.187
<i> ¶ I bless the rains down</i>
<i> in a...</i>

18:09.189 --> 18:10.021
(GASPS) Damn it!

18:10.023 --> 18:14.959
<i> ¶ Gonna take more than that</i>
<i> to make me leave this pla...</i>

18:15.361 --> 18:16.327
Gah! Come on!

18:16.329 --> 18:20.431
<i> ¶ I hate the rains</i>
<i> down in Jenkintown ¶</i>

18:20.433 --> 18:22.233
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While Erica's dreams</i>
<i> broke down,</i>

18:22.235 --> 18:25.636
<i> me and Pops were ready</i>
<i> to build Barry back up.</i>

18:25.638 --> 18:26.871
Hi.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.072
Hey.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.908
So, me and Pops
are starting our Batman movie,

18:30.910 --> 18:33.511
but we couldn't decide
which Batman was better,

18:33.513 --> 18:35.446
so we're gonna have both.
Sounds fun.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.716
Actually, we thought you could
have some fun with us.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.520
Really?
I mean, we got
the superheroes,

18:42.522 --> 18:43.654
but no one for us to fight.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.824
I don't know.
I didn't really like
being the Joker.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.227
I think this time you will.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.229
Follow us.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.300
No way!
A BMX Batman movie?

18:56.302 --> 18:58.402
Look, we never meant
to leave you out,

18:58.404 --> 19:02.840
and now that you're here,
I say we turn
the dynamic duo

19:02.842 --> 19:05.510
into the fearsome
threesome!

19:06.045 --> 19:11.215
<i> ¶ It's really getting soaked</i>
<i> down in Jenkintown</i>

19:11.217 --> 19:15.119
<i> ¶ There's nothing that</i>
<i> a hundred men or more</i>
<i> could ever do ¶</i>

19:15.121 --> 19:17.989
How's it going?
It's going great.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.491
Listen, I realized
you were right about me,

19:20.493 --> 19:24.428
screaming at you
all these years
about finishing college,

19:24.430 --> 19:25.663
and I didn't even
see it through.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.799
So you're not gonna
make me go home
and apply to new schools?

19:28.801 --> 19:30.201
I'd like to, but I can't,

19:30.203 --> 19:32.236
not after lying to you
all these years.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.939
So that's it?
Tell me I'm a moron!

19:34.941 --> 19:36.941
Tell me not to
give up on myself!

19:36.943 --> 19:38.209
Tell me to apply
to new schools

19:38.211 --> 19:40.077
and make something
of my stupid life!

19:40.079 --> 19:42.346
Sounds like I don't
have to say anything

19:42.348 --> 19:44.148
because you
already know it.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.917
I guess you're right.

19:46.352 --> 19:50.321
I also know that
if I'm gonna start college,
then you're gonna finish it.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.823
Hey, I do high-level
accounting every day.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.926
It's one credit.
Come on.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.161
Okay, fine.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.830
If you're willing
to see it through...

20:00.133 --> 20:00.798
So can I.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.701
ADULT ADAM:<i> That day,</i>
<i> my dad was the hero</i>
<i> who saved Erica,</i>

20:03.703 --> 20:05.469
<i> and she ended up</i>
<i> saving him right back.</i>

20:05.471 --> 20:07.705
<i> And that night,</i>
<i> I finally got the chance</i>

20:07.707 --> 20:12.510
<i> to be the Dark Knight,</i>
<i> with my superfamily</i>
<i> by my side.</i>

20:12.779 --> 20:14.245
The Joker's on the loose.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.213
To the Batmobile.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.949
To the better Batmobile.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.585
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Because in the end,</i>
<i> the greatest superheroes</i>

20:20.587 --> 20:23.054
<i> ...don't have powers</i>
<i> or wear capes.</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:24.589
<i> They're the people</i>
<i> who stick with us</i>

20:24.591 --> 20:26.924
<i> through the greatest</i>
<i> adventure of all...</i>

20:26.926 --> 20:27.558
<i> Growing up.</i>

20:27.560 --> 20:30.728
<i> ¶ I bless the rains</i>
<i> down in Africa ¶</i>

20:30.730 --> 20:34.599
<i> Truth is, it's not</i>
<i> how many gadgets we have</i>
<i> in our utility belt</i>

20:34.601 --> 20:35.299
<i> that get us through life.</i>

20:35.301 --> 20:38.102
<i> What really saves the day</i>
<i> are the loved ones</i>

20:38.104 --> 20:40.504
<i> who stand by our side</i>
<i> and help us fight</i>

20:40.506 --> 20:43.107
<i> to make our dreams come true.</i>

20:56.956 --> 20:59.590
I am... Super!

21:01.494 --> 21:03.294
POPS: Batm'n.
Batman.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.829
That's what I said...
Batm'n.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.564
No, you're saying,
"Batm'n."

21:06.566 --> 21:09.133
Listen...
"I'm Batman!"

21:09.135 --> 21:10.868
"I'm Batm'n."

21:11.337 --> 21:13.704
"I'm Batman!"
"I'm Batm'n."

21:13.706 --> 21:15.506
"I'm Batman!"
"I'm Batm'n."

21:15.508 --> 21:17.708
What on Earth
are you two doing?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.877
No need to be
alarmed, citizen.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.412
We are crime-fighting
professionals.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.749
Get off the side of the house,
or I'll kill both Batmans.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.751
See, that's how
you say it.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.222
I'm walking off
this picture.
