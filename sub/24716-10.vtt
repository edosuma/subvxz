All these guys run around here

00:07.674 --> 00:10.051
'cause they, uh, hit the books

to go to trial.

The test is multiple choice.

Schweiss lived with his brother Martin.

I was moving into the apartment.

My apartment.

I explained I had rented
the apartment some weeks ago.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.455
He grew belligerent, then he knocked
a Stickley end table out of my hand.

you claim the apartment is yours.

the apartment?

Uh. He showed it to me,

08:33.012 --> 08:36.098

and first month's rent right on the spot.

-Six thousand dollars.

Where are you on the homicide?

12:55.065 --> 12:57.234
Narcotics identifies a dealer
named Ricky Carson.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.403
He works a corner down the street
from where the DOA lived.

12:59.653 --> 13:00.946
That's off the girlfriend's statement?

13:01.071 --> 13:03.032
Plus the kid asked for some weed
when we were there.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.366
Figures he knows the dealer.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.951
You don't think the girlfriend's involved?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.245
She was pretty upset. If she's lying,
she's doing a good job.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.748
We're gonna pick up this Ricky Carson,
find out what he knows.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.541
Let me know when you get him in.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.586
IRVIN: Can I help you?

13:15.753 --> 13:18.589
I'm looking for Detective Medavoy
or Jones.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.635
-I'm Greg Medavoy.
-Bridget Scofield.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.555
-This is my partner, uh, Baldwin Jones.
-Let's go talk back here.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.063
Typically, I handle sales
of residential units.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.565
I should have stuck with what I knew.

-A cup of coffee?
-I'm fine. Thank you.

13:40.152 --> 13:43.405
BALDWIN: Have a seat.
But why rent the one place?

13:43.614 --> 13:46.951
The owner had to go overseas
and asked if I would sublet the unit

13:47.159 --> 13:50.079
while he was gone. He...
he's a good client, so I said yes.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.039
No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.001
Uh. How did you rent the apartment
to Jerome King?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.087
He called in off the listing.

13:58.587 --> 14:02.132
Said he was a currency trader
for an international finance firm,

14:02.299 --> 14:04.134
and he had just been transferred
to New York.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.427
BALDWIN: How would you describe him?

14:05.803 --> 14:08.472
Thirties, well-dressed, British...

14:09.682 --> 14:11.433
-charming.
-Did you check him out?

14:11.809 --> 14:14.311
His references, his employer,
everything was fine.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.438
And I assume those were all fake.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.567
-Unfortunately, yes.
-Did you run a credit check?

14:19.692 --> 14:22.611
He said it was his first time
living in the US.

14:22.778 --> 14:26.949
He didn't have a social-security number,
and it was gonna be a big hassle,

14:27.116 --> 14:30.828
so he asked if I would skip
the credit check

14:31.036 --> 14:32.746
if he agreed
to put up additional security.

14:32.913 --> 14:36.125
I was so anxious to get
the place rented, I agreed.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.253
-It was stupid.
-Oh, you can't blame yourself, ma'am.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.922
Anybody could fall
for a smooth talker like this.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.092
(SIGHS) One of the defrauded tenants
has already called

14:45.301 --> 14:46.427
and said he's gonna sue me.

14:46.886 --> 14:51.181
My lawyer says because I didn't check
King's credit, I could be liable.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.101
Do you have any idea
how much he got away with?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.896
Could be as much as
150,000, 200,000 dollars.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.689

14:58.856 --> 15:01.734

to bring this man to justice.

to him anymore,

18:28.607 --> 18:29.775
saying I'm taking advantage.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.069
I explained that I can sell
to whoever I wanted to,

18:32.236 --> 18:34.029

-Why would I say that?
-I don't know.

Maybe because Donald Schweiss
turned up dead.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.558
-Sure.
-He a friend?

for a few months.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.856
He's not in any trouble, is he?

23:20.023 --> 23:21.733
Well, his name came up
in an investigation,

23:21.900 --> 23:23.735
and, uh... (SIGHS) ...we haven't been able
to reach him.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.905
Anything you can tell us
will, uh, help clear things up,

23:27.072 --> 23:29.116
-as far as he's concerned.
-Okay.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.450
How would you describe him?

23:31.618 --> 23:36.915
He's charming, a lot of fun, rich...
Not that that's important.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.627
-Um. Is he English?
-He was born in South Africa, actually,

23:40.877 --> 23:43.505
raised in England,
but he went to school in Switzerland.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.090
What did he tell you about his work?

23:45.590 --> 23:50.095
He does currency trading,
and banking stuff... money.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.597
-He works with money.
-Well, he ever mention real estate,

23:52.764 --> 23:55.100
-selling apartments, renting them?
-No.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.601
When's the last time you saw him?

23:57.602 --> 24:00.480
Four days ago. He went to San Francisco
on a business trip.

-Is that him?
-Yeah.

-This looks like he's arrested.
-His name is Eddie Palm.

24:08.822 --> 24:12.617

that was fraudulently rented

-Jerome's one of his aliases.

-No, we don't.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.460
I told you, Jerome doesn't do real estate.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.129
Alyssa, this guy lied to you.
We're sorry, but that's the way it is.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.380
No, you lied to me.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.632
You said you were going to help Jerome,
and you didn't.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.385
-I'm going.
-You can't do that.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.929
Palm set up the con on your computer.

you're working with him.

Otherwise, you're part of it.

34:06.252 --> 34:08.838
if I tell anyone, we can't do it anymore.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.299
Martin, are you and Kathleen
having sex?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.596
Don't tell her I told you, okay?

34:17.180 --> 34:21.434
I... I did hit Donald sometimes,
but I always said I was sorry,

34:21.642 --> 34:22.894
and I always meant it.

I really must insist
you stop calling me that.

34:33.529 --> 34:36.157
Come on, it's over. We found
your fingerprints in the apartment.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.950
I don't know what apartment
you're talking about.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.287
(SIGHS) Oh, uh, the apartment
that, uh, you rented to, uh,

34:41.454 --> 34:45.500
Mr. Westphal, the Allens,
the Pierces, Mr. Schnell.

34:45.666 --> 34:46.959
Your fingerprints don't lie.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.878
I believe your government
recently accused

34:49.045 --> 34:51.589
an American lawyer of working
with terrorists in Spain.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.592
They had his fingerprints too,
except they were wrong.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.095
The woman who rented you
the apartment picked you out.

34:57.345 --> 34:58.888
And, of course,
she couldn't be mistaken.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.057
BALDWIN: We got a whole lot of people
waiting to pick you out.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.892
You're gonna be the most picked-out guy
we ever had.

35:03.017 --> 35:05.311
See, each rental
is a separate fraud charge.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.355
Put them all together,
you're looking at 30 years.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.565
Your only hope of cutting back
on that time

35:09.732 --> 35:11.526
is if you tell us where the money is

35:11.734 --> 35:13.820
and make restitution
to the people you stole from.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.280
I don't have any money.
I didn't steal from anyone.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.783
-Eddie!
-And my name is Jerome King!

35:18.950 --> 35:22.370
All right, this deal is on the table
for ten seconds.

35:22.578 --> 35:26.249
Tell us where the money is
or come out of jail an old man. You ready?

-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
-EDDIE: You have no idea

You told us
you were with Martin all night.

35:56.070 --> 35:59.282
He says he stayed in his apartment
while you went downstairs.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.702
To do some laundry.
It was all of about five minutes.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.497
Martin doesn't have a very good sense
of time. It probably felt longer to him.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.125
You said you were worried
because you didn't know where Donald was.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.627
Martin says that you told him
Donald was at Elena's.

36:12.211 --> 36:15.506
Well, I had to tell him something.
I mean, for all I knew, it was true.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.633
-Why didn't you call Elena's?
-ANDY: We checked your phone.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.260
There were no calls out last night.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.096
-I didn't want to bother him.
-You were that worried.

36:22.388 --> 36:23.681
I just didn't think of it.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.350
How long you been having sex
with Martin, Kathleen?

36:27.393 --> 36:29.061
I don't know what you're talking about,

36:29.228 --> 36:31.105
and I am not gonna answer
any more questions.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.274
Then we're gonna get a search warrant
for your apartment,

36:33.441 --> 36:35.359
-and no matter how hard you scrubbed...
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)

36:35.526 --> 36:38.487
...and cleaned, if there is one drop
of Donald's blood there,

36:38.654 --> 36:41.240
we're gonna find it.
So, if you want to help yourself,

36:41.532 --> 36:43.826
you better start answering
some questions here.

36:46.078 --> 36:49.457
You look at Martin,
and you see what's missing.

36:49.957 --> 36:51.083
I look at Martin,

36:51.500 --> 36:55.046
and I see a beautiful soul
that has opened itself to me,

36:55.713 --> 36:59.717
and I am not going to apologize
for that spiritual act.

36:59.884 --> 37:03.512
(INHALES SHARPLY) Did Donald find out?
Is that why he was gonna move Martin?

37:04.305 --> 37:06.807
-Donald never knew.
-What happened?

37:07.808 --> 37:10.561
I ran into Donald when I was coming up
from the laundry room.

37:10.770 --> 37:14.607
He told me that he was putting Martin
in a group home in Poughkeepsie.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.902
I told him that I would be more than happy
to take care of him myself,

37:18.194 --> 37:19.403
but he wouldn't listen.

37:20.613 --> 37:24.617
Guess he was too busy planning
his new life with his spik whore.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.869
How did you kill him, Kathleen?

37:30.456 --> 37:32.124
We were talking in my apartment...

37:33.626 --> 37:35.002
so that Martin wouldn't hear us.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.589
I was begging.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.301
I told Donald that I loved Martin,

37:42.468 --> 37:46.138
and that I wanted him to be a part
of my life. He laughed, he just...

37:46.931 --> 37:48.933
laughed. And turned away.

37:49.976 --> 37:54.772
That made me mad, so I grabbed
a lead bookend, and I hit him with it.

37:55.564 --> 37:59.527
I'm sorry, of course,
but he should have had more respect.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.904
(INHALES SHARPLY) What did you do
with the body?

38:03.614 --> 38:04.824
Wrapped it in a sheet.

38:05.700 --> 38:09.787
Later, I drug it into the elevator,
and I took him downstairs to the basement.

38:10.413 --> 38:11.831
I'm gonna need you to write this down.
