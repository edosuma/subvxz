00:39.374 --> 00:42.172
Atten-hut!

00:42.243 --> 00:45.734
Here's our man.
Professor Howard Plummer.

00:45.812 --> 00:49.475
He's been kidnapped
by a group of Serbian rebels.

00:49.549 --> 00:53.679
I know we've been up for 72
hours, but I expect perfection.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.722
Nothing else.

00:58.892 --> 01:03.123
The enemy has a boat,
four jet skis, and a chopper.

01:03.195 --> 01:05.959
I'll take you guys in
until we hit radar range.

01:06.032 --> 01:07.693
Then you'll dive from there.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.530
Once we hit our target,

01:09.602 --> 01:12.298
Red One, Red Two,
you take out our escorts.

01:12.371 --> 01:15.898
I'll handle the chopper,
and I'll find the professor.

01:15.975 --> 01:18.637
Red Three, you radio in
for our copter.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.769
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

01:20.845 --> 01:22.608
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

01:22.681 --> 01:26.981
We are SEALS.
And this is what we do.

03:16.922 --> 03:21.291
Ah!

03:37.008 --> 03:38.873
Red Two, handle the boat.

03:38.943 --> 03:41.036
I'll take care of the bozos
on the jet ski.

03:55.659 --> 03:57.388
Ah!

04:00.297 --> 04:01.730
Oh!

04:23.285 --> 04:25.617
Gotcha.

04:28.057 --> 04:30.389
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe,
U.S. Navy.

04:33.695 --> 04:36.323
Where is the briefcase?

04:36.397 --> 04:39.855
It's right behind you.
Man, am I glad to see you.

04:39.934 --> 04:43.870
- I never thought I'd see my family...
- I'll get you out.

04:43.938 --> 04:46.270
We're gonna do it my way.
No highway option.

04:46.341 --> 04:48.036
Yeah, I'm with you. Absolutely.

05:06.260 --> 05:08.989
Lieutenant, thank you so much
for saving my life.

05:09.061 --> 05:12.462
If I had died back there,
my wife, she would've killed me.

05:12.532 --> 05:13.931
Just a joke.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.731
Do you mind if I call my wife
to tell her I'm okay?

05:17.803 --> 05:20.567
I have strict orders
to get you out of here safely.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.800
We gotta keep moving.

05:21.874 --> 05:25.901
Lieutenant, I am safe.
Please. She thinks I'm dead.

05:25.978 --> 05:28.912
- All right, make it quick.
- Okay.

05:28.980 --> 05:32.643
Zoe, Seth, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.512
It's voice activated.

05:36.588 --> 05:39.148
Hey.

05:39.224 --> 05:40.851
These are my kids.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.287
You'd like 'em.
They're really great.

05:45.297 --> 05:48.823
I doubt it. Hurry up.

05:48.899 --> 05:51.959
Hey! We're almost ready.

05:52.036 --> 05:54.334
Give us another sec.

05:59.510 --> 06:00.875
Professor!

06:08.751 --> 06:11.242
The doctor says you've
healed up real good, Shane.

06:11.321 --> 06:13.255
I should've been
out of here weeks ago.

06:13.323 --> 06:15.348
Look, I know heads
are gonna roll for this.

06:15.425 --> 06:16.722
Hey, you took a bullet.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.455
Yeah, but I want you to know
I take full responsibility

06:19.529 --> 06:21.326
for what happened
to the professor.

06:21.397 --> 06:23.627
Plummer was the best
security expert

06:23.700 --> 06:25.564
the Department of Defense
ever had.

06:25.634 --> 06:29.593
He was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called "GHOST":

06:29.671 --> 06:32.105
Guided High-altitude
Scrambling Transmitter.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.835
One pulse from a GHOST satellite

06:33.909 --> 06:35.968
and a country can't launch
its own nukes.

06:36.044 --> 06:38.239
That's why the Serbians
kidnapped him.

06:38.313 --> 06:41.771
They must have thought that
GHOST was in that briefcase.

06:41.850 --> 06:44.818
GHOST is still out there.

06:44.885 --> 06:47.786
Which is why I'm sending you
back in.

06:47.855 --> 06:50.289
I know you've never lost anybody
before, Shane.

06:50.358 --> 06:52.792
I was with your father
when he led a platoon...

06:52.860 --> 06:55.021
With all due respect,

06:55.096 --> 06:57.530
I'd appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this.

06:57.598 --> 07:00.362
All I'm saying is that it
happens to the best of them.

07:01.535 --> 07:02.900
And you're the best.

07:02.970 --> 07:04.960
I need someone I can trust on this

07:05.038 --> 07:08.303
- and I know I can trust you.
- Okay.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.637
I'll put a team together.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.768
No. It's not
that kind of mission.

07:11.845 --> 07:14.712
This is at the top of the Pentagon's
priority list.

07:17.584 --> 07:20.712
<i>Two days ago,
I got a call from Admiral Blair.</i>

07:20.787 --> 07:23.983
<i>It seems that the professor's widow
contacted him.</i>

07:24.056 --> 07:25.546
<i>Whoever killed her husband</i>

07:25.624 --> 07:27.785
<i>must think that GHOST
is still in that house.</i>

07:27.860 --> 07:29.919
<i>Now, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.</i>

07:29.995 --> 07:34.056
<i>A safety deposit box has been discovered
in Zurich in the Plummers' name.</i>

07:34.133 --> 07:37.933
<i>I've been assigned to escort Mrs.
Plummer there to retrieve the contents.</i>

07:38.003 --> 07:40.995
<i>We're hoping it's the GHOST program.</i>

07:41.073 --> 07:43.939
<i>In the meantime, someone
needs to watch over those kids.</i>

07:44.008 --> 07:45.600
<i>That's where you come in.</i>

07:45.677 --> 07:48.805
<i>While there, you'll be looking
for the hidden program as well.</i>

08:07.764 --> 08:10.028
Ah!

08:16.840 --> 08:21.276
You must be Lieutenant Wolfe!
Admiral Blair said you'd be coming.

08:21.344 --> 08:23.369
Come on in.
Meet the rest of the gang.

08:23.446 --> 08:25.641
Come on.

08:25.715 --> 08:30.914
Kids! Get your butts
down here and say hello!

08:30.986 --> 08:36.356
Okay, you've already met Lulu.
This is Zoe, Seth and Peter.

08:36.424 --> 08:39.291
Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe.

08:39.361 --> 08:41.294
He's gonna stay with you
while I'm away.

08:41.363 --> 08:43.354
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:43.431 --> 08:47.731
Oh! This is Helga and Tyler.

08:47.802 --> 08:49.895
Ma'am. Baby.

08:49.971 --> 08:53.463
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

08:53.541 --> 08:56.032
I have date
with butcher tonight.

08:56.111 --> 08:58.044
I want to look nice.

08:58.112 --> 09:00.376
Ah!

09:08.989 --> 09:11.583
You have a pleasant family.

09:11.658 --> 09:13.558
Well, for the younger ones,

09:13.627 --> 09:15.686
I think it hasn't really
sunk in yet.

09:15.763 --> 09:19.698
It's been hardest
on Zoe and Seth.

09:19.766 --> 09:22.098
But they don't really
like to talk about it.

09:22.168 --> 09:24.466
Well, it must be hard
on all of you.

09:24.537 --> 09:26.835
Howard wasn't around much.

09:26.906 --> 09:28.965
His work took him
all over the world.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.839
He'd be gone six,
seven months at a time.

09:31.911 --> 09:34.141
Yeah, I can understand
that lifestyle.

09:36.248 --> 09:39.342
Anyway, about a week ago,

09:39.418 --> 09:41.750
someone broke into the house.
No one was home.

09:41.820 --> 09:44.516
I didn't tell the kids 'cause
I didn't wanna scare them.

09:44.589 --> 09:46.318
Mrs. Plummer, I've dealt with...

09:46.391 --> 09:48.586
Ow! Oh, my God!

09:48.660 --> 09:51.993
I'm sorry. That's Gary.
He was Howard's.

09:52.063 --> 09:53.928
Gary, down!

09:53.999 --> 09:55.556
He bit me.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.726
Yeah, well,
he thinks he's a guard dog.

09:57.802 --> 10:02.330
- Mrs. Plummer?
- Oh, call me Julie. Please.

10:02.406 --> 10:05.204
I'm gonna go outside
and have a look around.

10:05.276 --> 10:06.641
Out, out.

10:41.477 --> 10:44.037
I'm gonna miss you.
Mmm...

10:44.112 --> 10:45.943
I'm gonna miss you too.

10:46.014 --> 10:48.778
I'll be back in 48 hours, okay?

10:48.851 --> 10:51.547
Bye, pumpkin.
I love you, pumpkin.

10:54.455 --> 10:57.424
Oh, and kids? Remember,

10:57.492 --> 11:01.053
whatever Lieutenant Wolfe
asks you to do, do it.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.154
Mom, chill.
We're gonna be fine.

11:07.468 --> 11:09.629
I'm sorry.
I don't do this very often.

11:09.704 --> 11:11.398
You're going away for a few days.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.768
Yeah, I know.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.704
I got it.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.435
Okay. Here you go, Helga.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.536
- I take baby.
- Bye. Bye.

11:19.613 --> 11:22.081
It's okay.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.480
You remember
the emergency numbers, right?

11:24.551 --> 11:27.543
Don't worry, Mrs. Plummer,
your kids'll be safe with me.

11:27.621 --> 11:31.454
Your little angels will be fine,
Mrs. Plummer.

11:39.064 --> 11:41.897
Go.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.434
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

11:43.502 --> 11:45.527
Have some fun.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.835
Bye-bye.

11:50.742 --> 11:54.371
Tell me,
are you licensed to kill?

11:54.445 --> 11:56.072
No, ma'am.

11:56.147 --> 12:00.174
Too bad.
It could have come in handy.

12:09.893 --> 12:11.690
Ah!

12:11.762 --> 12:14.026
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

12:15.365 --> 12:16.923
Please!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.491
Oh, my God! Shut up!

12:19.570 --> 12:22.403
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

12:25.976 --> 12:28.637
Hey!

12:28.711 --> 12:31.680
- Where's the baby?
- Tell me. Come on.

12:31.747 --> 12:34.238
No!

12:34.317 --> 12:36.751
Shut up! No, she didn't.

12:36.819 --> 12:39.447
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

12:39.522 --> 12:41.046
Oh, my God. Tell me!

12:41.123 --> 12:43.614
Is there anyone here
that understands

12:43.693 --> 12:45.661
the meaning of the word
"discipline"?

12:45.728 --> 12:50.255
Hey, Flipper. You don't like it?
Do something. I make bottle.

12:54.269 --> 12:55.634
Thank you, Peter.

13:04.079 --> 13:07.104
Yes!

13:21.829 --> 13:24.263
- Ow!
- Gotcha!

13:24.331 --> 13:27.390
Ah!

13:32.005 --> 13:33.597
What's your problem?
Get off me!

13:33.673 --> 13:34.662
Oh, my God!

13:34.741 --> 13:37.335
What are you doing, you spaz?
That's my boyfriend!

13:37.410 --> 13:39.469
So you're the one breaking in!

13:39.545 --> 13:41.035
- Go back inside!
- No!

13:53.258 --> 13:55.226
We speak English, buddy.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.818
Look, about the sirens
and the strobe lights.

13:57.896 --> 14:01.093
We own a bakery, so we're up
kind of early. Would you mind?

14:01.199 --> 14:02.961
Sorry.

14:04.935 --> 14:08.132
Oh, and we found this
in our pool filter.

14:08.205 --> 14:10.765
Keep that zoo reined in,
huh, babysitter?

14:12.643 --> 14:16.545
Yo, fool, handle me like that again
and I'll lay knuckles upside your head!

14:16.614 --> 14:19.139
Okay! Enough is enough!
Come on, Scott, let's go!

14:19.216 --> 14:20.808
- Come on.
- No, you don't.

14:20.885 --> 14:25.821
Get back here.
Give me 20.

14:25.889 --> 14:27.356
I meant push-ups!

14:27.424 --> 14:30.689
- Zoe?
- Drop down! Do 20!

14:30.760 --> 14:33.854
- This is not the Army or Navy!
- One...

14:33.930 --> 14:36.091
Real nice move, Lt. Smooth.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.861
He'll probably never speak to me!

14:37.934 --> 14:40.402
- Then I did you a favor.
- Whoa!

14:40.470 --> 14:42.061
Personal bubble invasion.

14:42.137 --> 14:44.435
Your mother was worried sick
about you!

14:44.506 --> 14:46.406
You should call here and tell her.

14:46.475 --> 14:48.705
I'm sure you'll take care of that
for me.

14:48.777 --> 14:51.405
Stay out of my life!

14:54.216 --> 14:56.377
Wait! You can't do this!

14:56.452 --> 14:59.285
I have plans!
It's Saturday night! Ow!

14:59.354 --> 15:00.752
Not anymore.

15:02.924 --> 15:07.884
- You too. Lights out.
- Bite me.

15:07.962 --> 15:10.396
Boy, this family's in
for a rude awakening.

15:54.340 --> 15:55.671
What are you doing?

15:55.741 --> 15:57.731
You're burning daylight! Move!

15:57.809 --> 16:00.300
It's Sunday.

16:00.411 --> 16:03.380
And it's 6am!
You're insane!

16:10.522 --> 16:12.285
Listen up!

16:12.357 --> 16:15.053
Your behavior is unacceptable.

16:15.126 --> 16:17.389
In order to maintain
a state of safety,

16:17.461 --> 16:19.292
we need to maintain
a state of order.

16:19.363 --> 16:21.456
One more little bite?

16:21.532 --> 16:23.966
We going to be strong mine
worker when we grow up.

16:24.034 --> 16:25.433
Excuse me.

16:25.502 --> 16:27.197
Excuse me!

16:29.072 --> 16:31.438
Now, I've only got one rule.

16:31.508 --> 16:34.477
Everything is done my way.
No highway option.

16:34.545 --> 16:36.910
- Do you copy?
- Do you copy?

16:36.979 --> 16:43.780
What? I said, "Do you copy?"

16:43.853 --> 16:47.846
- Do not copy me.
- Do not copy me.

16:47.924 --> 16:52.926
Hey, I mean it.
Cut it out!

16:52.995 --> 16:54.791
Uh...

16:56.598 --> 16:58.623
Peter farted.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.100
- Oh, that is so gross.
- Quiet!

17:01.169 --> 17:05.105
Everybody up.
That means you too.

17:05.173 --> 17:08.631
Tracking devices,
never take them off.

17:08.710 --> 17:12.874
The panic button
is for emergencies only.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.848
Touch that,
you'd better be dying.

17:15.915 --> 17:17.781
Or you're dead.

17:17.852 --> 17:20.820
I would rather chew off my arm
than wear that.

17:20.887 --> 17:25.051
Just because my mom is paranoid doesn't
mean we have to take orders from you.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.388
Let me explain how
the chain of command works.

17:27.461 --> 17:30.294
I tell you what to do
and you do it!

17:30.364 --> 17:33.389
End of chain.

17:33.466 --> 17:36.458
I'm not gonna have time
to remember all of your names.

17:36.536 --> 17:41.906
You'll be Red Leader.
Red Baby. Red One. Red.

17:43.843 --> 17:46.835
Where's the older male?
There were five.

17:46.913 --> 17:50.246
He walks like Dracula

17:50.316 --> 17:55.480
with footsteps
silent like death.

17:55.554 --> 17:57.249
He's in his room.

18:01.093 --> 18:02.617
Red Two!

18:04.396 --> 18:05.829
Red Two, open up!

18:06.765 --> 18:08.494
Red Two!

18:16.908 --> 18:18.842
What have you done?

18:18.910 --> 18:20.502
What? I thought...

18:20.578 --> 18:22.944
Is this what you're
trained to do?

18:23.014 --> 18:24.777
A "shock and awe" on my door?

18:24.849 --> 18:27.909
I can fix that
with a hammer and some nails.

18:27.985 --> 18:30.077
- It's real easy to fix.
- No, it's not! Look!

18:30.153 --> 18:33.953
It's broken in half!
You can't fix that!

18:34.024 --> 18:37.482
If you'd been wearing this,
this wouldn't have happened.

18:37.560 --> 18:42.930
What are you talking about?
I was in the bathroom!

18:42.999 --> 18:45.968
You know I would never
ask you for your help...

18:46.036 --> 18:48.435
...but he has got to go.

19:06.055 --> 19:08.750
Somebody help me, please!

19:08.823 --> 19:10.882
Help me, somebody!

19:10.959 --> 19:15.328
- Stop it, Peter! This is nuts!
- Peter, cut this out.

19:18.232 --> 19:23.260
Hey, good soldiers
aren't scared of anything.

19:23.338 --> 19:25.203
I'm not scared. I'm annoyed.

19:25.273 --> 19:28.537
Ever since he heard Daddy say
there was a ghost in the house,

19:28.608 --> 19:32.977
he puts on that blanket and chases me
everywhere. It drives me crazy.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.707
Peter, have you seen this ghost?

19:42.789 --> 19:44.689
All right, here he comes.

19:58.471 --> 20:01.702
Hey! You leave towel
on floor in bathroom.

20:01.774 --> 20:05.106
I pick up after kids,
not you.

20:05.176 --> 20:07.974
And light a match next time.

20:08.046 --> 20:11.812
Oh!

20:22.594 --> 20:24.117
Good news.

20:24.194 --> 20:26.321
Your background checks
have cleared,

20:26.397 --> 20:28.331
and we are free
to give you the box.

20:28.399 --> 20:30.128
- Oh.
- Excellent.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.658
Just as soon as you
provide us with the passwords.

20:33.737 --> 20:34.897
Passwords?

20:34.972 --> 20:36.462
It was your husband's wish

20:36.540 --> 20:38.599
that the person who collects the box

20:38.675 --> 20:41.109
must provide us
with the passwords.

20:42.179 --> 20:43.304
Great.

20:43.379 --> 20:46.143
- Is it "The GHOST?"
- Ghost.

20:46.215 --> 20:47.842
Mmm... No.

20:51.788 --> 20:56.191
<i>These brats! Sugi pula!</i>

20:56.259 --> 20:58.352
I had it!

20:58.428 --> 21:02.363
- Remain calm.
- I am calm.

21:02.431 --> 21:06.492
I quit!
That makes me calm.

21:06.568 --> 21:09.435
Let's not be hasty about this.

21:19.648 --> 21:21.512
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

21:21.582 --> 21:25.541
<i>- Don't even think about it!
- Lt. Wolfe?</i>

21:25.619 --> 21:26.745
<i>It's Julie Plummer.</i>

21:26.821 --> 21:28.618
<i>- Who's this?
- Julie Plummer.</i>

21:28.689 --> 21:30.850
<i>- What's that?
- Julie Plummer!</i>

21:30.925 --> 21:32.893
Ah!

21:32.960 --> 21:35.292
<i>- Oh, Mrs. Plummer.
- Did something fall?</i>

21:35.362 --> 21:38.354
<i>- What was that noise?
- Nothing. Everything's okay!</i>

21:38.432 --> 21:42.299
You'll be happy to know that I found
the culprit that's been sneaking around!

21:42.368 --> 21:44.427
<i>- Great. Who was it?
- Just some teenager.</i>

21:44.504 --> 21:48.065
<i>Teenager? I wanted to tell you
I'm gonna be a few more days.</i>

21:48.141 --> 21:50.234
You'll be a few more days?

21:50.310 --> 21:53.939
<i>- Yes, is that a problem?
- No, that's no problem!</i>

21:54.013 --> 21:57.540
No, I'm fine.
I'm just... I'm just doing my...

21:57.617 --> 21:59.140
<i>Your what?</i>

22:00.719 --> 22:03.119
<i>- Duty.
- Sure everything's okay?</i>

22:03.188 --> 22:04.780
Things are great,
Mrs. Plummer.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.189
Yeah, you just do
whatever you have to.

22:07.259 --> 22:10.285
<i>- Well, tell the kids I said...
- Bye, Mrs. Plummer!</i>

22:11.864 --> 22:13.991
Just hang...
Let's calm down.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.299
Just... just try to relax.

22:18.369 --> 22:22.999
Ah!

22:28.746 --> 22:30.976
Ah! She bit me!

22:31.048 --> 22:33.812
Red Leader!

22:33.885 --> 22:37.047
I command you to come back here!
That's a direct order!

22:37.120 --> 22:39.315
You can't leave a man behind!

22:39.389 --> 22:41.550
Red Leader!

22:42.359 --> 22:43.587
Red Leader!

22:43.660 --> 22:46.493
I don't even know
how to change a diaper!

22:47.764 --> 22:49.925
Don't worry!

22:50.000 --> 22:53.094
If she loves you,
she'll come back, huh?

22:54.671 --> 22:58.367
Okay, everybody, listen up.
There's been a change of plans.

22:58.440 --> 23:01.170
Your mother's not coming home
as soon as she expected.

23:01.243 --> 23:03.768
- When is she coming back?
- Soon.

23:03.846 --> 23:05.973
For now,
we'll just have some more big fun.

23:06.048 --> 23:08.209
That's what we've been doing?
Having fun?

23:08.284 --> 23:11.617
- Tomorrow's a school day.
- I have wrestling.

23:11.687 --> 23:13.245
I need a release for Driver's Ed.

23:13.322 --> 23:14.812
I've got Fireflies.

23:14.890 --> 23:16.049
I have to go to the mall.

23:16.124 --> 23:18.058
I have to stop her
from spending so much.

23:18.126 --> 23:20.390
Whoa, okay, Halt. Halt!

23:20.461 --> 23:22.622
We'll take this hill
one inch at a time.

23:22.697 --> 23:24.631
Only then can we rise
to the challenge.

23:28.937 --> 23:31.838
Okay,
who's gonna change Red Baby?

23:31.906 --> 23:33.498
Guys?

23:38.679 --> 23:40.078
Ah!

23:41.114 --> 23:44.242
God! Red Baby!

23:46.053 --> 23:48.988
Alrighty. We'll try this.

23:49.056 --> 23:51.388
Yes. Whoa.

23:51.458 --> 23:54.324
Ooh. Soak that up a bit.

24:03.269 --> 24:05.931
Hi. Zoe says you look
like The Hulk.

24:06.005 --> 24:07.666
I think you're cute.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.765
Thank you.

24:13.345 --> 24:16.109
- Do you do kung fu?
- Yes.

24:16.181 --> 24:19.673
Did you ever punch someone
so hard that their head came off?

24:19.751 --> 24:21.582
No.

24:22.821 --> 24:24.755
Why are your boobs so big?

24:27.459 --> 24:29.518
They're not boobs.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.754
Do you have to wear a bra?

24:38.435 --> 24:40.494
Will my boobs
get as big as yours someday?

24:45.109 --> 24:46.906
You know, little girl,

24:46.977 --> 24:51.743
I think it's time you went
nappy-poo in beddy-bye land.

24:51.814 --> 24:55.375
Do I look like I'm five to you?

24:57.020 --> 24:58.817
What did I say?

24:58.921 --> 25:02.516
Disrespectful. And to think
I was interested in you!

25:06.195 --> 25:09.130
Okay, troops! Breakfast!

25:09.198 --> 25:11.392
What are you waiting for?
Dig in.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.956
Feel free to mix and match.

25:13.035 --> 25:15.595
Stay away from the cheese.
It'll back you up.

25:15.671 --> 25:18.799
Don't worry about running out.
I can get lots more of these.

25:18.874 --> 25:20.933
I've survived months
off this stuff.

25:21.009 --> 25:23.807
Okay, like, I'm really gonna eat
all of these carbs?

25:25.080 --> 25:26.945
I can cross my eyes.
Wanna see?

25:27.015 --> 25:28.413
No.

25:36.257 --> 25:38.054
Tyler hates it when I do that.

25:38.125 --> 25:39.956
I know how he feels.

25:41.896 --> 25:45.423
What's he...? Red Four!

25:54.307 --> 25:57.367
Plummer residence.

25:57.444 --> 26:00.345
Yes, I know it's Monday today.

26:00.447 --> 26:02.506
No, Mrs. Plummer's away.

26:02.549 --> 26:05.211
Yes, we'll be right there.

26:06.186 --> 26:07.777
Who was that?

26:07.853 --> 26:10.083
Your vice principal.

26:10.155 --> 26:12.623
He said that if you and Seth
are late again,

26:12.691 --> 26:14.318
you're both suspended.

26:14.393 --> 26:17.089
He wants to see you
in his office right away.

26:52.729 --> 26:55.220
What is it?

26:55.298 --> 26:58.358
- It's a minivan.
- Ugh.

26:58.435 --> 27:01.063
Now,
is this supposed to...?

27:01.138 --> 27:03.628
- How do we...?
- Excuse me, Mr. Wolfe?

27:03.706 --> 27:06.174
If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna be late for sure.

27:06.242 --> 27:08.233
Not on my watch.

27:13.616 --> 27:16.244
- Hold that.
- How fast is your watch?

27:18.354 --> 27:20.379
You'll be suspended for sure.

27:21.624 --> 27:23.921
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

27:23.992 --> 27:26.586
Who drives like this?
You're crazy!

27:36.704 --> 27:39.172
What are you doing?
Stop!

27:42.810 --> 27:44.437
Got 'em here.

27:44.511 --> 27:46.604
My fault.

27:46.680 --> 27:50.741
Yeah, I always said these kids
needed a parole officer.

27:50.818 --> 27:53.878
I guess, uh, Mrs. Plummer
thought so too, huh?

27:56.089 --> 27:59.388
Wow, you got a real, uh,
upper torso going on, huh?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.120
You ever, uh, do any time?

28:02.795 --> 28:05.161
Sasquatch.

28:05.231 --> 28:08.064
- You got something to say, boy?
- No.

28:08.134 --> 28:09.829
No? Good.

28:09.902 --> 28:12.928
Wow, it looks like you
have a pair of legs

28:13.005 --> 28:14.666
coming out of your shoulders.

28:14.740 --> 28:17.436
- You hit the gym a lot, do you?
- Eh.

28:17.510 --> 28:20.137
- Woolly Mammoth.
- You know what, Creeper?

28:20.212 --> 28:23.909
You just bought yourself
an extra 15 minutes on the mats.

28:23.982 --> 28:26.143
With the Murninator!

28:26.218 --> 28:29.585
Excuse me.
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe.

28:29.654 --> 28:32.919
I'm watching the kids
for the Plummers. A few days.

28:32.991 --> 28:35.323
Oh, babysitter, huh?

28:35.393 --> 28:38.226
Well, good.
Whatever job you can get, right?

28:38.296 --> 28:41.321
I'm Murney.
Duane Murney.

28:41.398 --> 28:43.730
My friends call me
"Little Puppet. "

28:43.801 --> 28:45.200
I'm the VP here.

28:45.269 --> 28:48.796
I'm in charge of discipline,
conduct and truancy

28:48.873 --> 28:53.105
from top to bottom,
K through 12.

28:53.177 --> 28:55.509
You're in my house now,
strong man.

28:55.579 --> 28:59.207
- You're the vice principal.
- And the wrestling coach.

28:59.282 --> 29:00.943
See the Creeper over there?

29:01.017 --> 29:04.612
He has played hooky from every
wrestling practice this month.

29:04.687 --> 29:08.714
And her, she has missed
22 Driver's Ed classes.

29:08.791 --> 29:11.316
Out of 23!

29:11.394 --> 29:13.726
These are the worst students
in my school.

29:13.796 --> 29:16.822
- I'm ashamed...
- Your school?

29:18.600 --> 29:21.068
Good morning, kids.

29:21.136 --> 29:24.037
Mr. Murney,
thanks for watching my chair.

29:24.106 --> 29:26.939
- I'll take it from here.
- Roger. Absolutely.

29:27.009 --> 29:29.034
I was just informing
our new friend here

29:29.111 --> 29:31.443
about some of the duties
as vice principal.

29:31.513 --> 29:34.380
Speaking of which, how's it
going with the investigation

29:34.449 --> 29:36.916
into the baloney slices
on the cafeteria ceiling?

29:36.984 --> 29:40.112
- Taking some interesting turns.
- Keep up the good work.

29:40.187 --> 29:43.418
Right. I'll be on the roof.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.925
Bye, now.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.291
All right, it's time
to get back to class.

29:48.362 --> 29:52.423
I'll cut you some slack seeing as
it's Lt. Wolfe's first day. Thank you.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.025
Okay.

29:55.101 --> 29:57.569
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Yes, please.

30:00.674 --> 30:03.006
So, what's with this Murninator?

30:03.076 --> 30:05.670
He's big, he's hairy,
he's sometimes smelly,

30:05.745 --> 30:07.940
but he's harmless
and he has tenure.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.608
So, you're the bodyguard?

30:10.684 --> 30:12.481
Mrs. Plummer thought the kids...

30:12.552 --> 30:15.987
She briefed me on everything
and she told me that the kids

30:16.055 --> 30:17.955
aren't fully aware of the situation

30:18.023 --> 30:20.116
and that's the way she wants it.

30:22.027 --> 30:24.962
She also told me
you're a "Teams" guy.

30:25.030 --> 30:27.931
- Yes, I am.
- Well, Petty Officer Third Class

30:28.000 --> 30:31.026
- Claire Fletcher at your service.
- You're kidding.

30:31.103 --> 30:34.265
Four years at Naval Base
Coronado. They paid for college.

30:34.339 --> 30:37.172
- Honor, courage.
- Commitment.

30:37.241 --> 30:39.402
It's the way I run this school.

30:39.477 --> 30:40.808
I like that.

30:44.248 --> 30:48.480
So, permission to stick around
and keep eyes on the kids?

30:48.553 --> 30:50.817
Permission granted.

31:00.097 --> 31:03.260
<i>We don't need no music
We don't need no band</i>

31:03.333 --> 31:07.235
<i>All we need is Mustangs
and jammin' in the stands</i>

31:07.304 --> 31:09.568
<i>We said jammin' in the stands</i>

31:09.640 --> 31:12.904
<i>J- A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands</i>

31:12.975 --> 31:17.002
<i>What? J-A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands</i>

31:17.079 --> 31:20.105
Go, Mustangs! Whoo!

31:20.182 --> 31:23.583
"Black belt.
Honorable discharge. "

31:23.653 --> 31:25.644
Clean as a whistle.

31:27.256 --> 31:30.520
- Yeah, you little punk!
- Where's your babysitter now?

31:34.496 --> 31:36.191
Hey!

31:36.264 --> 31:39.131
- Enough.
- All right, you heard the lady.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.794
Let's break it up, guys.
Come on. Hmm?

31:41.870 --> 31:45.533
Relax, Popeye.
Boys will be boys, huh?

31:45.607 --> 31:49.440
It's kinda good for the Creeper.
Gives him a chance to punk up.

31:49.510 --> 31:52.809
- Learn to defend himself.
- Six against one?

31:52.880 --> 31:54.814
Well, the odds are never pretty.

31:54.882 --> 31:57.214
But look at it as, like,
a preparation for him.

31:57.284 --> 31:59.013
The naked streets of Bethesda

31:59.119 --> 32:01.212
can be so dark and dangerous.

32:01.255 --> 32:05.316
- Right, Creeper?
- Ooh. Whoa.

32:05.392 --> 32:07.622
You're pretty quick there, frogman.

32:07.695 --> 32:09.924
I, myself,
happen to be a black belt.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.726
That's why they wanted me
to coach the wrestling team.

32:12.799 --> 32:15.233
Ooh-ah!

32:15.301 --> 32:17.565
Sensei.

32:17.637 --> 32:19.798
You know what that's called, homeboy?

32:19.872 --> 32:22.204
Total control.

32:22.275 --> 32:23.833
You all right? Hmm?

32:23.910 --> 32:26.708
Maybe sometime you can pop by
the wrestling class

32:26.779 --> 32:29.440
and, uh, we'll show the boys
how a couple pros do it.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.539
What do you think?
I'll go easy on you.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.278
- I'm on duty.
- You're on duty.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.445
Oh, that's right,
you're a babysitter.

32:36.521 --> 32:39.547
So it's kinda like "doo-doo" duty.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.388
Don't worry about it.

32:43.462 --> 32:47.397
We'll do it on a day when you're
not, uh, washing your hair. Hmm?

32:48.833 --> 32:51.927
And I'll see you in class.

32:52.837 --> 32:54.771
At ease.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.233
That guy don't have his head on right.

32:59.343 --> 33:03.006
I was fine!
I don't need your help!

33:06.916 --> 33:08.850
Okay, okay.

33:08.918 --> 33:14.185
- Aw. Hey, rough day?
- I tried feeding him.

33:14.257 --> 33:15.849
Yeah? Did you try changing him?

33:15.925 --> 33:18.723
- Would you help me?
- No.

33:18.795 --> 33:21.457
Just the thought of...

33:27.035 --> 33:30.971
- Emergency.
- What are you...? I... Hey!

33:31.707 --> 33:33.572
Hi.

33:33.642 --> 33:35.633
What's up with him?

34:08.675 --> 34:10.699
Where are you going?

34:20.687 --> 34:25.054
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

35:16.206 --> 35:18.197
Ha-ha.

35:19.809 --> 35:21.106
I should go, okay?

35:21.177 --> 35:23.509
Call me, you guys,
if you need anything.

35:23.579 --> 35:26.343
My number's on the fridge.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.905
Are you okay?

35:27.983 --> 35:31.612
Oh... Wow.

35:34.123 --> 35:35.852
Is there anything I can do?

35:35.925 --> 35:37.654
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

35:37.727 --> 35:40.559
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm fine.

35:40.628 --> 35:43.688
I mean, they're just kids,
you know.

35:43.765 --> 35:46.165
Call me if you need anything.
Okay?

35:46.234 --> 35:49.101
After you shower.
Or, before. It doesn't matter.

35:49.170 --> 35:51.161
I'll see you guys.

35:55.009 --> 35:59.445
Very funny.
Thank you for the letter.

36:24.103 --> 36:27.470
Guys, be quiet.
I told you he had boobs.

36:28.908 --> 36:31.638
Lulu, can I see you
in the family room?

36:35.413 --> 36:38.007
Who are those people?

36:38.083 --> 36:41.746
My troop. Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday are troop nights.

36:41.820 --> 36:43.685
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

36:43.755 --> 36:46.883
Parents go out on troop nights.
They'll be back at 8:00.

36:46.958 --> 36:48.482
Mom's our den mother!

36:48.560 --> 36:51.825
You better tell your little
friends that they have to...

36:58.302 --> 37:02.295
- Today we're supposed to sell cookies.
- I don't do cookies.

37:02.373 --> 37:05.103
We have to. If we don't
sell enough cookies,

37:05.176 --> 37:07.838
we can't go
to the Jamboree.

37:13.516 --> 37:15.575
They're waving at me.

37:15.652 --> 37:20.089
All right, ladies!
Here's how it's gonna be!

37:20.156 --> 37:22.886
Tonight I'm your den mother.

37:22.959 --> 37:25.587
That means if you want
to live to see tomorrow,

37:25.662 --> 37:27.562
you do exactly as I say!

37:27.630 --> 37:29.825
Do we understand each other?

37:29.899 --> 37:32.833
Den mother,
you frighten me.

37:32.901 --> 37:34.630
Good.

37:34.703 --> 37:36.830
Now, let's move out!

37:47.816 --> 37:49.681
- I call the front!
- Middle back!

37:49.751 --> 37:51.445
Fine, I'll get the back.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.953
Yeah, he's kind
of a dork, but he's okay.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.319
<i>- How's Helga?
- Helga's fine.</i>

37:56.390 --> 37:58.688
<i>- When are you getting home?
- I'm sorry...</i>

37:58.759 --> 38:02.525
Look, Mom, I'd love to stay and chat
all day, but I have homework to do.

38:23.516 --> 38:25.746
Oh, no!
They're back!

38:32.424 --> 38:35.882
Hey, Skeever, what glows
in the dark till you squish 'em?

38:35.961 --> 38:37.053
Fireflies!

38:45.604 --> 38:47.731
Please. Leave us alone.

38:47.806 --> 38:49.636
This is troop 16 territory.

38:49.707 --> 38:52.073
How are we supposed
to sell raffle tickets

38:52.143 --> 38:54.737
if this place reeks
of your skanky cookies?

38:54.812 --> 38:57.007
Hey! Hey!

38:57.081 --> 38:59.675
Boo!

39:01.185 --> 39:02.743
Get outta here!

39:02.820 --> 39:06.256
- These cookies taste disgusting.
- I know.

39:06.324 --> 39:10.259
- We really scared these guys.
- Where are my troops?

39:21.638 --> 39:22.969
Lulu, what happened?

39:23.040 --> 39:25.600
Those boys over there
broke our cookies.

39:25.676 --> 39:27.267
Broke your cookies.

39:27.343 --> 39:29.868
- Mm-hm.
- Lulu, this is not a toy.

39:29.946 --> 39:34.974
Forget those boys. I am here
to protect you, not cookies.

39:35.051 --> 39:37.042
Understand?

39:37.119 --> 39:40.282
Good, now get in the car.
We're all going home.

39:40.356 --> 39:44.053
Wait. You can't take us home yet.
You're supposed to take us to eat.

39:44.961 --> 39:46.985
Where do you usually go?

39:47.062 --> 39:50.429
Welcome to Woody Woodchuck's!

39:57.539 --> 40:00.303
Let go!

40:03.345 --> 40:05.938
And they say war is hell.

40:24.897 --> 40:27.127
Ah! I figured you'd
come back for him.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.101
Lulu, watch your brother.
Inexcusable!

40:30.169 --> 40:32.694
- I've never left a man behind.
- Oh, relax.

40:32.772 --> 40:36.208
Once we found a kid in the ball pool
when we opened in the morning.

40:36.275 --> 40:37.674
Whoa! Whoa!

40:37.744 --> 40:42.374
Not cool! Uh, there is no
freestyling in the ball pool!

40:53.392 --> 40:55.724
Should we send
someone in after him?

41:01.833 --> 41:03.561
We're good.

41:13.911 --> 41:16.505
Holy baloney.

41:16.580 --> 41:20.482
Ooh! Someone's gonna get busted!

41:20.551 --> 41:23.075
- Who are these people?
- What's wrong with this?

41:23.153 --> 41:27.453
- We need to talk.
- Don't hate the player, hate the game.

41:33.897 --> 41:35.956
Beat it.

41:39.135 --> 41:40.863
Party's over!

41:40.936 --> 41:42.665
Oh, my God, it's here.

41:42.738 --> 41:45.730
You're all gonna clean
this house spotless.

41:45.808 --> 41:49.039
No highway option.
Now, get cleaning.

41:49.111 --> 41:51.079
- I'm outta here!
- Wait! Scott!

41:51.146 --> 41:53.171
Move! Later!

42:00.922 --> 42:03.015
Oh, no, you don't.

42:11.599 --> 42:13.590
This is my favorite shirt.

42:28.248 --> 42:30.307
Thank you.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.708
Come on, Seth! You've
been in there for an hour!

43:02.180 --> 43:05.581
Thanks a lot, Lt. Loser! Now
I'm gonna be the school joke.

43:05.650 --> 43:07.880
I don't know what
I'll say to my friends.

43:07.952 --> 43:10.921
You call those people
your friends?

43:10.989 --> 43:14.481
They have no respect for you.
They have no respect for your home.

43:14.559 --> 43:17.118
You have no respect
for yourself!

43:17.194 --> 43:19.594
I do, too, respect myself!

43:19.663 --> 43:22.029
Company downstairs.
That means you too.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.499
You're not my dad.

43:24.568 --> 43:26.433
In case you
haven't noticed,

43:26.503 --> 43:29.199
this family is going through
a really hard time

43:29.273 --> 43:31.867
and you're just making
everything a lot worse.

43:31.942 --> 43:34.001
You have no feelings.

43:34.077 --> 43:37.807
We hate you
and you hate us.

43:37.880 --> 43:40.178
So why don't you
just leave us alone?

43:40.249 --> 43:43.582
Don't worry. When your
mom comes back, I'm gone.

43:45.188 --> 43:48.180
- Now what?
- Scott.

43:50.860 --> 43:53.055
Run! Take the babies!
Go to your rooms!

44:16.417 --> 44:18.681
Shane! Come over here!
Take one of these!

44:18.752 --> 44:20.117
Lulu!

44:21.322 --> 44:24.553
- Get inside. Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Wait!

45:25.716 --> 45:27.809
Don't move.

45:32.422 --> 45:34.253
Ahhhh!

45:44.668 --> 45:46.898
Kids, it's safe!

45:46.970 --> 45:50.598
- Who was that? What'd they want?
- What happened?

45:50.673 --> 45:52.834
- Don't leave us!
- What do they want?

45:52.908 --> 45:55.775
They were after the program
that your father invented.

45:59.581 --> 46:01.879
They were after this.

46:03.552 --> 46:06.884
All right, all right, come on,
guys. Let's hope this is it.

46:11.993 --> 46:15.485
<i>- 9- 2-6, 3-1-0-4-3.
- 9- 2-6...</i>

46:15.563 --> 46:16.621
<i>3- 1-0-4-3.</i>

46:16.698 --> 46:18.563
<i>They want our
Ghost movie?</i>

46:18.633 --> 46:20.464
Haven't they heard
of Blockbuster?

46:20.535 --> 46:23.527
<i>- Tell her Rita Miller.
- Rita Miller.</i>

46:23.604 --> 46:26.538
So there really are people
out there to get us?

46:26.606 --> 46:29.166
Yes, there are, Zoe.
That's why I'm here.

46:29.242 --> 46:32.302
I think we're gonna need
a little more cooperation.

46:32.379 --> 46:35.837
From now on,
you listen to me...

46:35.916 --> 46:37.679
...and I'll listen to you too.

46:38.552 --> 46:40.179
Deal?

46:41.922 --> 46:44.117
- Relax. Relax.
- I'm relaxed.

46:44.191 --> 46:46.988
- If you just relax...
- I'm relaxed! I'm relaxed!

46:47.059 --> 46:49.994
You've got to relax!
Please, it's on the...

46:50.062 --> 46:51.893
Okay. I'm not
feeling well, here.

46:51.964 --> 46:54.694
- Oh, my God! There's a bee!
- There's no bee!

46:54.767 --> 46:57.327
- There's a bee!
- There's no bee! Stop! Please!

46:59.238 --> 47:02.435
Okay, so she wrecked the car.
The insurance will pay for it.

47:02.508 --> 47:05.908
They were parallel parking.
The instructor jumped.

47:05.977 --> 47:08.878
But it's not about her.
It's about the boy.

47:08.947 --> 47:10.676
Has he been
skipping class again?

47:10.749 --> 47:13.741
Skipping class? He always
skips sixth period, but...

47:13.818 --> 47:14.876
All right. Seth!

47:17.956 --> 47:19.446
Okay, take off the hat.

47:20.625 --> 47:21.956
Go ahead.

47:24.895 --> 47:27.557
Look at that.
That's how he showed up for practice.

47:27.631 --> 47:31.658
I was doing a little recon in
his locker and I found this.

47:33.103 --> 47:34.627
Okay?

47:34.705 --> 47:38.732
If it was a girlie
magazine or a hamster, fine.

47:38.809 --> 47:42.744
Boys will be boys.
But this is sick.

47:42.812 --> 47:44.939
All right. He dyed his hair.
He's not a Nazi.

47:45.014 --> 47:47.380
This is not normal.
We're very concerned.

47:49.051 --> 47:51.042
Why don't you get back to class?

47:51.120 --> 47:53.520
Mr. Murney, would you
give me a minute?

47:58.895 --> 48:01.090
Look, I'm sure this
is about their father.

48:01.163 --> 48:05.532
We've tried to get Seth and Zoe to talk
to the psychologist, but they won't.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.262
Maybe you can get through to them?
See what's going on?

48:08.336 --> 48:10.463
I'll talk to them
and see what I can do.

48:11.273 --> 48:13.002
Thanks.

48:15.343 --> 48:19.575
Seth, I don't understand
unless you explain it to me.

48:19.648 --> 48:22.047
Why would you join wrestling
if you hate it?

48:22.116 --> 48:24.107
Because my father
wanted me to!

48:24.185 --> 48:27.586
Look, I know you're
just trying to help, but don't!

48:27.655 --> 48:29.850
I can take care of myself.

48:50.510 --> 48:53.206
Refrigerator magnet.

48:54.647 --> 48:57.047
Smart kid.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.677
Red One!

48:59.751 --> 49:04.484
You're in charge. Anyone gets within
40 clicks of the perimeter, signal me.

49:04.556 --> 49:07.992
Keep all doors sealed, do
your homework, preheat the oven

49:08.060 --> 49:11.257
and don't let Lulu
in the cookie jar.

49:41.525 --> 49:45.393
- Everything's ready?
- Yeah.

49:49.366 --> 49:50.924
Come on.

50:06.181 --> 50:10.311
All right. All my Nazis
are finally here.

50:10.386 --> 50:13.753
I want all of you
at attention!

50:13.822 --> 50:17.188
Okay, let's start
where we left off yesterday.

51:02.635 --> 51:05.968
We open in a week, people.
The set isn't finished.

51:06.038 --> 51:09.405
Mother Abbess just quit
because she got shingles!

51:09.475 --> 51:13.934
And every step-ball change would
make Bob Fosse rise from the grave

51:14.012 --> 51:16.606
just so he could have
a heart attack again!

51:16.681 --> 51:21.277
- I'm really sorry. I'll get it right.
- No, you won't, Seth.

51:21.353 --> 51:25.187
You and your mother
over here can't get it right.

51:25.256 --> 51:28.623
And I know this
because I am a professional.

51:28.693 --> 51:31.126
<i>I directed Show Boat
with Greg Brady.</i>

51:31.195 --> 51:33.493
It wasn't union,
but it was good.

51:40.871 --> 51:42.862
Obviously, I quit!

51:42.940 --> 51:47.673
Exeunt stage right!

51:50.113 --> 51:54.049
Seriously, Seth, if you drop me
again, I'm going to kill you.

51:54.117 --> 51:56.347
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

51:56.419 --> 51:58.319
I'm fine.

51:59.522 --> 52:01.080
Come on.

52:01.157 --> 52:03.250
I'm not gonna quit!

52:03.326 --> 52:07.319
- I don't expect you to understand...
- Hey...

52:07.397 --> 52:11.355
I may not understand a whole
hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,

52:11.433 --> 52:13.958
but I definitely
understand not quitting.

52:14.036 --> 52:17.130
And from what I see,
you're pretty good.

52:17.205 --> 52:20.368
A little discipline,
you could make a go of this.

52:20.442 --> 52:23.809
- But what about Murney?
- He's an all-talk spaz.

52:23.879 --> 52:26.347
<i>So, The Sound of Music?</i>

52:26.415 --> 52:29.349
- I saw it when I was a kid.
- Really?

52:29.417 --> 52:34.116
The idea of a nun ditching her
habit for a guy in the military.

52:34.188 --> 52:37.589
Nothing wrong with that.

52:37.658 --> 52:39.717
Do you think girls
will think I'm weird?

52:39.794 --> 52:42.695
They probably already do, Seth.

52:42.763 --> 52:45.027
But you'll kill 'em later.

52:47.133 --> 52:49.328
Come here.

52:49.402 --> 52:52.860
Forget about everyone else
for a second.

52:52.939 --> 52:56.204
Is performing
what makes you happy?

52:56.276 --> 52:58.744
Yeah,
more than anything.

53:00.847 --> 53:03.839
All right, fall in.

53:03.917 --> 53:06.680
Company. Center stage.

53:09.521 --> 53:12.217
Company! Center stage!

53:12.291 --> 53:15.158
Who is this guy?

53:15.227 --> 53:20.597
Now, do you or do you not have
what it takes to perform this musical?

53:20.666 --> 53:24.466
- We don't have a director.
- I've directed rescue missions

53:24.536 --> 53:26.969
all around the world.

53:27.038 --> 53:30.098
I've directed numerous
snatch-and-grabs

53:30.174 --> 53:34.907
from countries whose names
you are not allowed to know.

53:34.979 --> 53:39.678
I've choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings

53:39.751 --> 53:42.276
and stealth air attacks!

53:42.353 --> 53:47.483
Do you think I have
the military proficiency...

53:47.557 --> 53:50.617
...to direct this production?

53:50.694 --> 53:52.161
Yes.

53:52.229 --> 53:55.096
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir!

53:55.165 --> 53:58.132
Once upon a time,
there was a family...

53:58.235 --> 53:59.998
...of elves.

54:00.036 --> 54:05.302
And one day the little elf family

54:05.374 --> 54:08.707
went into the magic forest

54:08.778 --> 54:12.009
to find a secret...

54:12.081 --> 54:14.140
...gnome...

54:14.216 --> 54:15.581
...facility,

54:15.651 --> 54:21.521
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium.

54:21.590 --> 54:27.528
So three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes

54:27.595 --> 54:32.931
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank,

54:33.001 --> 54:37.335
finishing off anything left alive.

54:40.275 --> 54:45.576
And not one of those elves
were left behind that day.

54:45.646 --> 54:47.807
We got 'em all.

54:50.951 --> 54:54.148
Even the teeniest...

54:54.221 --> 54:58.157
...littlest elf of all...

54:58.225 --> 55:00.556
...Rodriguez.

55:00.626 --> 55:04.153
You're gonna have to do
the Panda dance or he won't stop.

55:04.230 --> 55:06.755
Oh, come on...

55:06.833 --> 55:08.994
I don't know how to do
the Panda dance.

55:09.068 --> 55:11.559
I'll write it down for you.

55:11.637 --> 55:14.629
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

55:14.707 --> 55:17.471
You gotta do the dance.

55:17.543 --> 55:21.672
Like Dad used to do.
He made it up for him.

55:21.746 --> 55:24.408
You have to do the dance
to make him sleep.

55:24.983 --> 55:28.384
Come on.

55:43.133 --> 55:45.658
- Lulu.
- Thank you.

55:45.736 --> 55:47.966
Seth.

55:48.038 --> 55:49.699
Zoe. Uh!

55:49.773 --> 55:51.673
Today you drive.

55:51.742 --> 55:54.870
But I can't even
pass Driver's Ed.

55:54.945 --> 55:57.140
Exactly.

56:01.017 --> 56:03.042
We're all gonna die.

56:04.287 --> 56:06.847
Have you ever given
a driving lesson before?

56:06.923 --> 56:08.618
In a minivan? No.

56:08.691 --> 56:11.091
Think of it like
a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.752
Especially when Zoe's driving.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.901
- Zoe Plummer!
- Zoe, what are you doing?

56:20.969 --> 56:23.460
- What are...? Slow down!
- Truck!

56:30.345 --> 56:32.813
Whoa! Whoa!

56:32.881 --> 56:35.747
- Whoa!
- Not bad.

56:39.120 --> 56:42.214
Land! Solid land!

56:42.290 --> 56:46.283
- I think it went well.
- Oh, it's so dramatic.

56:47.728 --> 56:50.219
Hey, hey, hey. No fighting.

56:50.298 --> 56:51.959
- Play nicely.
- Sorry.

56:52.033 --> 56:54.660
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

56:54.734 --> 56:59.000
I have noticed an improvement in the
Plummer kids and I'm very impressed.

56:59.105 --> 57:02.165
Yeah, you know,
they're just misunderstood.

57:02.208 --> 57:04.802
Peter, careful!
Don't make me come up there!

57:04.878 --> 57:07.574
Someone needs to take the time
to talk to 'em.

57:07.647 --> 57:11.981
- You're getting a little attached.
- I take my job very seriously.

57:12.752 --> 57:15.948
But it's like you said.
They're just kids.

57:16.021 --> 57:20.219
Well, keep up the good work.

57:20.960 --> 57:23.656
Oh!

57:23.729 --> 57:26.095
You look very nice today.

57:26.765 --> 57:31.099
Oh. Thanks.

57:31.170 --> 57:34.696
I don't think you understand.
Don't you ever do that again.

57:34.772 --> 57:37.206
Is that clear?
Okay, I've had it.

57:37.275 --> 57:41.371
I caught the kid dancing to no music.
I want him out of my class.

57:41.446 --> 57:44.347
Somebody's gotta give this punk
a talking to.

57:44.415 --> 57:47.145
Seth?

57:47.218 --> 57:50.085
Well, you got something
to say, twinkle toes?

57:51.723 --> 57:54.190
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Murney.

57:54.257 --> 57:56.452
- I quit.
- You quit.

57:56.526 --> 57:59.518
You know why you quit?
Because you're a quitter.

57:59.596 --> 58:02.565
And everybody knows
that quitters...

58:02.632 --> 58:04.099
...quit.

58:06.937 --> 58:08.837
What are you scared of, Prancer?

58:08.905 --> 58:13.000
- I'm not scared. I want to act.
- And I want to take up origami.

58:13.075 --> 58:16.442
<i>- I'm in The Sound of Music.
- Oh. A musical.</i>

58:16.512 --> 58:19.174
You're giving up wrestling
to be in a musical.

58:19.248 --> 58:21.910
That happens when there
isn't a man in the house.

58:21.984 --> 58:25.852
There is a man
in the house. It's me.

58:25.921 --> 58:29.913
Well,
it's gotta be a tiny house.

58:33.795 --> 58:36.286
You think you're tough, boy,
don't you?

58:37.499 --> 58:39.967
Wanna shave the tiger?
Do you? Huh?

58:40.035 --> 58:42.868
- You want it tough?
- Where did you wanna do this?

58:42.937 --> 58:47.067
- What are you talking about?
- You said you wanted to wrestle.

58:47.142 --> 58:49.302
Where? When?

58:50.878 --> 58:52.937
- After school.
- Okay.

58:53.914 --> 58:57.975
- Today?
- That's right. The gym.

58:58.052 --> 58:59.610
Okay?

58:59.686 --> 59:04.385
Remember. You mess with
the bull, you get the horns.

59:13.699 --> 59:15.530
Out of my way!

59:17.603 --> 59:20.436
- How did that feel?
- It was good.

59:24.644 --> 59:28.443
Murney is getting
his butt kicked at 3:00!

59:36.488 --> 59:38.718
Oh, that is so gross.

59:38.790 --> 59:42.191
Come on! Come on!

59:42.260 --> 59:45.661
What? That's it!

59:45.730 --> 59:49.256
Someone's gonna get hurt today
and you know who it is?

59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.836
You're about to enter
Murney's House of Pain!

01:00:00.911 --> 01:00:05.973
What do you say we go over
the rules, cue ball? Huh?

01:00:06.883 --> 01:00:08.817
Oooh!

01:00:08.885 --> 01:00:11.251
Rule number one.

01:00:11.321 --> 01:00:15.587
Never be too eager
to rush your opponent.

01:00:15.658 --> 01:00:20.459
Wanna play prison rules, frogman?
Wanna play prison rules? You got it.

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.556
I'll be your daddy.

01:00:26.235 --> 01:00:28.863
Ah!

01:00:28.937 --> 01:00:31.770
All right.
Now you've unlocked the beast.

01:00:32.608 --> 01:00:34.166
Oh, God!

01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:36.973
From this position,
it's relatively easy

01:00:37.045 --> 01:00:40.640
- to manipulate your opponent.
- Ohhh!

01:00:42.084 --> 01:00:44.347
And thus we have
the chicken wing.

01:00:45.853 --> 01:00:47.844
The chicken wing.

01:00:47.922 --> 01:00:49.651
The arm bar.

01:00:51.325 --> 01:00:54.158
The crow bar.
Or my personal favorite...

01:00:54.228 --> 01:00:58.062
- Ahhhh!
... the pacifier!

01:01:08.108 --> 01:01:10.201
Any questions?

01:01:10.277 --> 01:01:12.507
Anything you
didn't understand?

01:01:13.547 --> 01:01:15.572
Ah. The nipple crippler.

01:01:15.649 --> 01:01:19.551
This is a useless, not to mention,
shameless move

01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:23.611
that ultimately is a sure sign
of desperation.

01:01:28.127 --> 01:01:29.856
And finally...

01:01:35.134 --> 01:01:37.227
Pinned!

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.462
That was awesome!

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:46.305
- Are you okay, Murney?
- Get away from me!

01:01:47.946 --> 01:01:51.575
Can I get a little help, please?
I can't move my back. Watch the back!

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.863
Go!

01:02:17.207 --> 01:02:18.901
Sorry!

01:02:22.011 --> 01:02:23.774
I didn't get that cone!

01:02:35.057 --> 01:02:36.786
Crawl!

01:02:52.207 --> 01:02:54.698
See? But he usually
breaks down the door.

01:03:21.567 --> 01:03:25.435
Excellent!
Now do it backwards.

01:03:36.348 --> 01:03:38.509
Okay.

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:37.271
- Again.
- Again?

01:04:37.339 --> 01:04:40.604
You're going to sleep.
Good night, Peter Panda.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.439
Good night, Daddy.

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:53.346
Good night, little fella.

01:04:55.723 --> 01:04:57.816
Good night.

01:05:07.135 --> 01:05:11.036
Hey, Skeever, what do you put in a jar
and shake till they're dead?

01:05:11.104 --> 01:05:13.334
Fireflies?

01:05:15.675 --> 01:05:19.509
Go away
and we won't hurt you.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:32.614
Hiya!

01:05:37.663 --> 01:05:39.824
Don't even think about it.

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:00.077
Cookie!

01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:03.949
Eat it, you jerk!

01:06:04.022 --> 01:06:06.490
Go get 'em!

01:06:07.858 --> 01:06:10.622
Customer service.

01:06:18.769 --> 01:06:21.294
From now on, you do things our way!

01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:23.100
No highway option!

01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:26.266
Ah!

01:06:43.426 --> 01:06:46.053
- Gary the duck?
- No.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:48.152
We've been
here two weeks.

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:50.494
This is a matter of national security.

01:06:50.565 --> 01:06:54.661
Well, I am sorry, sir, but none
of these answers ring true.

01:07:00.008 --> 01:07:03.910
Howard. I'm so stupid.

01:07:05.579 --> 01:07:07.740
Is it "my angel"?

01:07:08.682 --> 01:07:10.582
Yes, it is indeed.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:19.622
Well, I'll leave you to your business.

01:07:25.131 --> 01:07:28.328
Please, Howard,
no more surprises.

01:07:48.987 --> 01:07:53.014
Zoe, a rookie sniper
could drop you like a deer.

01:07:53.091 --> 01:07:56.527
- Good.
- Good?

01:07:56.595 --> 01:07:59.359
All right,
this is about Scott again.

01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:02.456
No, it's not.

01:08:02.533 --> 01:08:07.664
You were right about him.
Stupid guy.

01:08:07.738 --> 01:08:11.230
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:08:12.143 --> 01:08:15.670
Nothing. Okay.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.719
You know, when I was little,
my mom left.

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:33.694
My dad was a spec ops soldier like me.

01:08:33.763 --> 01:08:39.758
When I was eight, he shipped
me off to military school.

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:49.474
I guess he liked being a soldier
more than he liked being a dad.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.308
One day, I get a letter.

01:08:54.383 --> 01:08:56.943
No more dad.

01:08:57.987 --> 01:09:00.180
That's terrible.

01:09:02.023 --> 01:09:06.483
For a long time I thought if I talked
about it, I was letting him down.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.429
Like I was supposed to be brave
or something.

01:09:12.966 --> 01:09:15.265
Yeah.

01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:22.339
It's okay to talk
about your dad, Zoe.

01:09:24.511 --> 01:09:29.140
I do miss him so much.

01:09:31.451 --> 01:09:33.680
I don't know, I just...

01:09:33.754 --> 01:09:37.051
I wanna be strong for Lulu
and Tyler and Peter

01:09:37.122 --> 01:09:39.683
and Seth and my mom.

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:42.694
That's such
a big burden to carry.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:48.032
I know.

01:09:49.868 --> 01:09:52.770
I miss him so much.

01:09:52.837 --> 01:09:56.000
It's okay to miss your dad.

01:09:59.978 --> 01:10:03.414
I'll get it.

01:10:03.481 --> 01:10:07.549
- Really?
- Yes.

01:10:07.619 --> 01:10:10.918
Seth! Seth! Guess what?
Mom's coming home.

01:10:10.989 --> 01:10:14.288
- When?
- Tomorrow! She's coming home tomorrow!

01:10:14.359 --> 01:10:16.485
- When did you talk?
- Mommy's coming.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.721
Here, buddy,
Mommy's coming home!

01:10:18.796 --> 01:10:20.058
Mom's coming home!

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:21.688
She is?

01:10:21.765 --> 01:10:23.255
She's coming back.

01:10:26.236 --> 01:10:28.397
Peter,
aren't you excited?

01:10:28.472 --> 01:10:33.932
- When's she gonna be here?
- So, what are we gonna do?

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:37.537
We should dress up nice.
We should make her something.

01:10:37.613 --> 01:10:40.810
- We'll clean up the entire house.
- That's a good idea.

01:10:40.883 --> 01:10:44.512
- We should make a banner too.
- In the family room.

01:11:03.472 --> 01:11:06.635
What's wrong, Gary?
Foot got stuck?

01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:10.673
Hang on, hang on.

01:11:12.046 --> 01:11:15.072
Okay, now just stay still.

01:11:36.336 --> 01:11:38.770
Hi. Come on in.

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:42.399
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, almost.

01:11:48.414 --> 01:11:50.278
<i>- Yes?
- Hey, it's Shane.</i>

01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:52.840
I have excellent news.
I think I found GHOST.

01:11:52.918 --> 01:11:55.079
<i>- Do you have it?
- It's in a steel vault.</i>

01:11:55.154 --> 01:11:59.648
It needs some sort of two-pronged key.
I've been working on it, but it's tough.

01:11:59.758 --> 01:12:02.226
Great. Good work.
We're on our way.

01:12:02.261 --> 01:12:05.287
Don't do anything further.
I'll be there soon.

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:06.922
Yes, sir.

01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:11.596
Ready?

01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:14.695
The good news is,
once I give this to my C.O.,

01:12:14.772 --> 01:12:17.605
whoever's been bothering you
ain't gonna be.

01:12:17.675 --> 01:12:19.666
- Really?
- Really.

01:12:19.744 --> 01:12:24.010
What's wrong? Your mother's
coming. You should be happy.

01:12:24.081 --> 01:12:26.982
But, Shane, doesn't that
mean you have to go?

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:31.183
You should get ready.
Your mother will be home soon.

01:12:49.205 --> 01:12:53.039
I had a fight with Zoe before I left,
so they probably trashed the place.

01:13:40.587 --> 01:13:42.054
Welcome home, Mom.

01:13:43.957 --> 01:13:48.017
Hi! I missed you!

01:13:48.094 --> 01:13:50.085
Guy!

01:13:56.636 --> 01:13:59.901
Shane, I am so proud of you.
I truly am.

01:13:59.972 --> 01:14:02.907
I am going to give you
your choice of assignment.

01:14:02.975 --> 01:14:07.240
Anywhere you want to go,
you just name it.

01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:10.076
Well, I appreciate that.

01:14:10.148 --> 01:14:12.912
But I'll have to think about it.

01:14:14.185 --> 01:14:15.846
You're gonna think about it?

01:14:15.921 --> 01:14:18.890
Well, the military's
all I've ever known.

01:14:18.957 --> 01:14:21.892
- I have no regrets.
- I should hope not.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.393
It's just that being
with this family...

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:26.725
- I've never had a...
- Put your hands up!

01:14:29.667 --> 01:14:31.259
The Chuns?

01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:35.603
You gotta be kidding.
I swear I checked them out.

01:14:35.673 --> 01:14:37.903
Give us the key.

01:14:37.975 --> 01:14:42.638
- Put your hands up!
- Okay. All right.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:44.577
Here.

01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:47.076
Now!

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:55.348
You promised us GHOST
months ago!

01:14:55.425 --> 01:14:58.451
Well, I'm sorry.
There were delays.

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:00.188
Shane!

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:02.128
Stop talking.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:05.530
Shane's not gonna be
babysitting you anymore.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.195
I trusted you.
Howard trusted you.

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:14.299
You've betrayed us
and you've betrayed this country.

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:17.277
Guess what?
North Korea pays better.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:20.542
Chun, watch them.
They're squirmy.

01:15:21.449 --> 01:15:24.441
You two, come with me.

01:16:01.653 --> 01:16:04.645
Did you bring the
stethoscope, Mrs. Chun?

01:16:04.723 --> 01:16:07.419
No, but I've
got some C-4.

01:16:16.868 --> 01:16:19.496
I just had my eyebrows done.

01:16:42.025 --> 01:16:43.822
Quiet!

01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:51.565
I said "Quiet,"
you little bug!

01:16:54.704 --> 01:16:56.227
Now, Peter!

01:16:56.338 --> 01:16:57.327
Ah!

01:17:05.114 --> 01:17:06.274
Hiya!

01:17:06.348 --> 01:17:08.339
Well, that's cute!

01:17:32.474 --> 01:17:34.338
That stuff doesn't hurt!

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:42.109
Shane! You can't do this!
You can't leave a man behind!

01:17:42.182 --> 01:17:43.774
Hold on, I got it.

01:17:44.918 --> 01:17:46.146
Shane!

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:48.654
- Where's Mom?
- Mom?

01:17:48.722 --> 01:17:50.690
I'll find her.
You guys run and get help!

01:17:50.757 --> 01:17:53.190
Hurry!

01:17:53.259 --> 01:17:55.159
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

01:17:55.228 --> 01:17:57.423
Yes, Lulu. Go, get help.

01:18:02.668 --> 01:18:03.965
Hold on!

01:18:05.705 --> 01:18:08.037
They're headed for the car!

01:18:08.107 --> 01:18:11.132
- Zoe, call 911.
- I forgot my cell phone.

01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:15.009
- Great. The only time you don't.
- We're gonna be okay!

01:18:25.857 --> 01:18:27.825
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

01:18:27.893 --> 01:18:29.121
Find a cop!

01:18:38.903 --> 01:18:39.961
Ahh!

01:18:52.382 --> 01:18:54.646
- He's gaining on us.
- I'll handle it.

01:19:21.109 --> 01:19:23.543
Look, Zoe! It's the cops!

01:19:32.253 --> 01:19:35.313
I assume you heard the Baloney
Bandit has struck again.

01:19:35.389 --> 01:19:40.554
I accept total responsibility.
My intelligence, well, it was faulty.

01:19:40.628 --> 01:19:43.324
If I had better resources...

01:19:53.173 --> 01:19:56.904
I told you not to pass her
in Driver's Ed.

01:19:56.977 --> 01:20:00.672
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

01:20:00.747 --> 01:20:04.615
- One, two...
- Bill.

01:20:04.684 --> 01:20:07.151
She doesn't know.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:10.484
And you're not taking another
parent away from those kids.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:13.024
Leave the family alone
and I'll get you in.

01:20:13.092 --> 01:20:14.616
You better not be bluffing.

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:23.293
Zoe! Seth!

01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:27.202
Lulu! Peter! Tyler!

01:20:29.674 --> 01:20:31.801
Ah!

01:20:31.876 --> 01:20:35.312
That was the code. I saw Mr. Plummer
use it to open the briefcase.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.340
You think this is a game?
Code or no code, open it. Now.

01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:42.283
You can't make him do this.

01:20:42.353 --> 01:20:45.685
I know Howard.
You haven't got a chance.

01:21:25.894 --> 01:21:29.091
Quick like a turtle!
Lie on your back!

01:21:52.086 --> 01:21:55.613
And that's
the Peter Panda dance.

01:21:55.689 --> 01:21:58.749
All right. Go.

01:21:58.859 --> 01:22:01.725
Yeah, right.

01:22:01.761 --> 01:22:03.820
Okay, I'll go first.

01:22:13.139 --> 01:22:15.869
Great work, Shane.
I knew you'd figure it out.

01:22:15.942 --> 01:22:19.035
I think you'd better open it.

01:22:22.781 --> 01:22:24.373
Wait, wait, wait!

01:22:24.449 --> 01:22:26.713
Back away.

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.588
You open it.

01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:33.055
Come on.
I walked the floor first.

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:35.286
No way.
You can do it, soldier man.

01:22:35.961 --> 01:22:37.053
Ah!

01:22:54.512 --> 01:22:56.139
Ahhh!

01:23:09.325 --> 01:23:11.156
Any last words, Shane?

01:23:11.227 --> 01:23:13.286
Say good night,
Peter Panda.

01:23:21.904 --> 01:23:24.065
Shane, are you okay?

01:23:24.139 --> 01:23:25.902
Oh!

01:23:27.810 --> 01:23:30.711
She was never
a good neighbor.

01:24:01.341 --> 01:24:03.434
Zoe, you're going too fast!

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:05.501
You're not gonna
have time to stop!

01:24:05.579 --> 01:24:08.946
Who said anything about
stopping? I'm parking.

01:24:22.394 --> 01:24:26.387
- What are you doing to these kids?
- Hands where I can see them!

01:24:26.465 --> 01:24:28.695
Okay. Calm down.

01:24:28.767 --> 01:24:30.997
Everybody!
Put your weapons down!

01:24:33.838 --> 01:24:35.806
I want the GHOST.

01:24:42.714 --> 01:24:47.014
Um... Calm down.
It's just a duck.

01:24:47.085 --> 01:24:49.383
- Where's the GHOST?
- I have it.

01:24:51.488 --> 01:24:52.853
Bring it here!

01:24:58.495 --> 01:24:59.894
Put it on the ground.

01:25:05.502 --> 01:25:08.164
Now, Gary.
Go for his balls.

01:25:08.238 --> 01:25:11.866
Okay, duck whisperer,
step away!

01:25:18.114 --> 01:25:19.843
Gary, now!

01:25:19.916 --> 01:25:21.315
Ah!

01:25:27.957 --> 01:25:30.151
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:43.102
So I guess you'll be
taking off now, huh?

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:47.870
Seeing as there's no reason
to stick around anymore.

01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:50.809
I'm still here,
aren't I?

01:25:51.979 --> 01:25:53.879
Yeah.

01:25:55.849 --> 01:26:00.411
- What now?
- I don't know. I'm on dry land.

01:26:00.521 --> 01:26:02.148
True.

01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:04.714
Which means you're
the superior officer.

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:06.692
True.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.659
So you tell me.

01:26:11.497 --> 01:26:12.521
Um...

01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:18.597
Lulu!

01:26:18.671 --> 01:26:21.003
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I have a few words?

01:26:21.074 --> 01:26:22.837
Sure.

01:26:22.909 --> 01:26:24.604
Well, we... I... You know.

01:26:25.845 --> 01:26:27.277
Oh.

01:26:28.914 --> 01:26:31.576
We'll talk later.

01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:35.518
- Mission accomplished, soldier.
- I suppose it is.

01:26:35.587 --> 01:26:40.115
- I guess you'll be leaving us now.
- I guess so.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.128
I want you to have this.

01:26:47.798 --> 01:26:50.323
Because I don't want you
ever to forget me.

01:26:53.804 --> 01:26:56.500
I will never forget you.

01:26:58.976 --> 01:27:01.444
'Cause you're the
best friend I ever had.

01:27:01.512 --> 01:27:04.912
No matter how far...

01:27:04.981 --> 01:27:07.779
...or long life takes me away,

01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:10.752
I will always be thinking about you.

01:27:12.822 --> 01:27:15.052
I love you, Shane.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.819
I love you too.

01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:31.672
From now on, it's your command.

01:27:34.576 --> 01:27:36.635
At ease, soldiers.

01:27:36.712 --> 01:27:40.546
Your father would
be so proud of all of you.

01:27:44.152 --> 01:27:45.312
Awww.

01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:47.047
Look who just woke up.

01:27:47.855 --> 01:27:49.880
- Shane?
- Yes?

01:27:49.957 --> 01:27:54.018
- Are we ever gonna see you again?
- What are you talking about?

01:27:54.095 --> 01:27:56.586
We still have one more mission.

01:28:34.433 --> 01:28:37.732
Looks like you have
a hit on your hands.

01:28:37.803 --> 01:28:39.929
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:40.004 --> 01:28:43.872
You should take over the drama
department instead of wrestling.

01:28:45.143 --> 01:28:48.112
It's gonna be nice
having you around now.

01:28:48.179 --> 01:28:50.704
Now that Murney's found
his true calling.

01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:02.450
It's gonna be my pleasure
serving with you.
