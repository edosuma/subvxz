00:02.536 --> 00:03.637
<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:03.737 --> 00:05.406
The last time
I saw you in the flesh,

00:05.506 --> 00:07.908
you were sitting
in that chair.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.943
Ah, the flesh.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.980
I don't miss it.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.083
So, what's the plan, son?

00:15.183 --> 00:16.750
I don't know.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.986
Thinking about
a vanilla shake.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.355
That's exactly what I'd do.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.657
Eat yourself sick?
Fill the hole.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.228
You do it with food,
I did it with Scotch.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.397
You also gambled.
Hey!

00:29.497 --> 00:30.664
If I wanted to talk to my wife,

00:30.764 --> 00:32.800
I would've visited my wife.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.368
The point is,

00:34.468 --> 00:35.969
you do what you have to do

00:36.070 --> 00:37.638
so you can get back to work
the next day.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.907
Call me if you need me.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.645
I'll always need you, Dad.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.417
All right.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.320
What do you think?

00:53.521 --> 00:55.156
Mm... Very dapper.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.092
Bob Wheeler is wearing
last year's spring collection

00:58.192 --> 01:00.994
because he couldn't
bring himself to pay full price

01:01.095 --> 01:02.563
for a Hugo Boss suit.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.865
You may want to
take off the tag.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.066
Eh, leave it on.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.668
I want potential
business partners to know

01:07.768 --> 01:09.803
I hold out for the best price.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.506
This factory is going
to change everything.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.208
All over the world,
when people see a foot,

01:14.308 --> 01:17.345
they will picture your face.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.447
Why stop at feet?
I could do gloves.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.115
It's really just
five tiny socks.
Mm-hmm.

01:21.215 --> 01:25.386
My dear, you can cover any
extremity you set your mind to.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.920
Paparazzi is gonna love us.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.490
"Sock mogul
and surgeon wife."

01:29.590 --> 01:32.993
Hmm. I prefer,
"Johns Hopkins educated surgeon

01:33.093 --> 01:35.263
and sock husband."

01:35.363 --> 01:36.897
I should be going. Okay.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.999
Hey, call me
the second you hear from them.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.968
I don't want to find out
you got into medical school

01:41.068 --> 01:42.536
from your mom's Facebook.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.938
Mummy has had it on Facebook
since I applied.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.412
What's up, buttercup?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.281
Dad? What the hell
are you doing here?

01:53.381 --> 01:54.848
Well, you tell me.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.751
What's got you circling
the cuckoo's nest this time?

01:57.851 --> 01:58.986
I'm fine.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.222
Why don't you go haunt
somebody else?

02:01.322 --> 02:02.523
Hey now, that's offensive.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.425
You see any chains here?

02:04.525 --> 02:07.495
Did I say, "Ooh"?
I'm not a ghost.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.862
As far as I can tell,

02:08.962 --> 02:10.831
I'm some kind
of physical manifestation

02:10.931 --> 02:13.634
of your subconscious,
here to help you externalize

02:13.734 --> 02:15.969
your stresses and insecurities,

02:16.069 --> 02:19.173
or... you did shrooms.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.542
I didn't do shrooms.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.311
I don't think.

02:23.411 --> 02:26.180
Well, let's figure this out.
How's the old lady?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.315
Marriage is great.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.950
How's the really old lady?

02:30.050 --> 02:31.785
Mom's good, too.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.454
You were always
too much of a coward

02:33.554 --> 02:35.489
to have any real addictions.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.392
Huh. I guess nothing's wrong.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.494
Exactly. I'll see you
the next time I go nuts.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.530
I look forward to it.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.070
You know something's wrong.
I know!

03:15.596 --> 03:17.865
This camera thing's
looking at me funny.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.500
Is it on?

03:21.068 --> 03:22.035
Oh!

03:22.135 --> 03:24.472
It's voice activated.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.906
This is the future.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.241
Kind of cool, huh?

03:27.341 --> 03:30.411
I am the great and powerful Bob.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.945
When Abishola
starts med school,

03:32.045 --> 03:33.847
I'm gonna be in Baltimore a lot.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.215
We have to adapt.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.117
Only Mr. Wheeler may adapt.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.287
If anyone else wants to teleconference,

03:39.387 --> 03:41.722
they must use
their paid time off.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.291
First things first,

03:43.391 --> 03:45.225
I want to update you on
our negotiations with Hanes.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.095
Everything looks g--

03:48.195 --> 03:49.563
Bob, you froze up.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.665
What do you think
was coming next?

03:51.765 --> 03:52.866
I heard a "guh."

03:52.966 --> 03:54.134
So, "good"?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.736
Could be "great."

03:55.836 --> 03:57.004
Or "grave."

03:57.104 --> 03:58.606
What the hell?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.708
This is a train wreck.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.076
Son of a bitch!

04:03.176 --> 04:05.546
Somebody brought
their weekend mouth.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.880
There we go.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.549
I showed Hanes
how much we could save them,

04:08.649 --> 04:11.585
and now they're squirming
on our line like a giant tuna.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.254
We will reel in
the son of a bitch. Kofo.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.290
It is business talk.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.327
You guys are really
moving up to the big leagues.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.562
We're really moving up
to the big leagues!

04:22.963 --> 04:25.198
Of course, they're gonna be
having all the fun.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.667
You're gonna be
in Baltimore,

04:26.767 --> 04:29.970
eating crab cakes
with your mother-in-law.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.406
Future's looking bright,
huh, guys?

04:36.243 --> 04:37.845
Mom, can you eat
something quieter?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.246
The camera's following you.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.748
That is a wonderful idea, Christina.

04:40.848 --> 04:41.849
What is?

04:43.150 --> 04:44.752
Kofo and I have
a whole mood board

04:44.852 --> 04:45.853
if you'd like to see it.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.588
I-I'm sorry, what was the idea?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.289
Bob, if this is gonna work,

04:49.390 --> 04:51.158
you got to pay attention.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.360
I am paying attention!

04:52.460 --> 04:54.828
Are you talking?
We can't hear you.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.830
Can you see me talking?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.099
This is friggin' painful.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.301
We lost him.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.971
Ugh, this is gonna be hell.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.208
That's it.
What?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.711
You don't want to go
to Baltimore.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.281
You are screwed, buddy boy.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.723
Excuse me, excuse me, move.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.525
Whoa, too far, too far.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.227
Excuse me, excuse me.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.797
Hey! No running
in my hall.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.732
You would think
with all the sex I have,

05:31.832 --> 05:33.501
I'd be in better shape.

05:33.601 --> 05:36.303
My cousin Adeppo's daughter

05:36.404 --> 05:39.673
just got her Johns Hopkins
acceptance email.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.942
<i>Oluwa mi o!</i>

05:42.042 --> 05:44.645
Now you see why I am glistening.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.614
We need to remember
this moment.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.588
There's nothing.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.425
Oh. Well, still
a nice picture.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.494
Give it to me.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.163
It's probably
in your junk folder.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.498
Oh, of course.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.500
The junk folder, yes.
Yeah, yeah.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.806
Do you have another junk folder?

06:12.906 --> 06:15.375
Oh, no.
I-It's okay.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.210
Maybe they're sending
the acceptance letters

06:17.310 --> 06:18.412
in alphabetical order.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.748
My last name is Adebambo.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.784
Maybe they are going
youngest to oldest.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.755
In that case,
you'd be very last.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.257
Let's not sit and
stare at the screen.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.892
A watched pot never boils.

06:33.661 --> 06:34.762
Who says?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.263
It's an expression.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.931
Well, it's a stupid one.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.767
I watch pots boil all day.

06:39.867 --> 06:40.934
Refresh the email.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.202
Refresh!

06:42.302 --> 06:44.805
I'm gonna go check
on my patients.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.006
Good idea.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.375
Because a watched patient
never dies.

06:48.476 --> 06:51.411
Refresh!
I am refreshing!
Do not shout.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.914
I'm sorry! This is
very stressful for me!

06:57.585 --> 06:58.986
This quaint row house is in

06:59.086 --> 07:01.154
one of Baltimore's
most desirable neighborhoods.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.657
Walking distance
from Johns Hopkins.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.726
Keep looking
until you find something

07:05.826 --> 07:09.763
that includes the words
"gaudy" or "extravagant."

07:09.863 --> 07:12.032
I did not realize we'd be
house hunting already.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.702
Uh, that's what I agreed to,
pack up and start over.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.770
No turning back.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.338
B-Town or bust.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.273
I think people call it B'more.

07:20.373 --> 07:23.010
Well, I couldn't
"B'more" excited.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.978
Lying to your wife.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.548
You get that from me.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.151
Hey, check this one out.
Lot of room.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.353
Beautiful kitchen.
Look at that fancy chandelier.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.823
So ostentatious.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.591
I love it.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.926
Well, I think I need
a little time

07:39.026 --> 07:41.361
to see about
the school situation.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.764
Uh-- For Dele.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.365
I already picked
Eastern Technical.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.000
It's the best school
in the Baltimore area.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.436
It's tough to get into,
but who's gonna say no

07:49.537 --> 07:52.139
to my grades and this face?

07:52.940 --> 07:54.642
See? Everything's
gonna be great.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.444
You are right.
Yeah, right.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.353
Another Milano for
my little chocolate cookie?

08:06.453 --> 08:09.790
Do not make me spill my tea.

08:09.890 --> 08:13.694
Well, if you do,
I will sop you up.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.799
Abishola!

08:18.899 --> 08:21.034
<i>E kaasan,</i> Uncle. Auntie.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.670
Did you get any mail for me?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.337
There is a stack over there.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.906
It is all junk.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.642
Well, except for the birthday
card from her dentist.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.079
What? If it comes
to Tunde's house,

08:32.179 --> 08:34.347
Tunde is going to open it.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.884
When I get him presents,

08:36.984 --> 08:39.386
I have them delivered
to the neighbor.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.254
Who also opens them.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.523
It has to be here.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.258
What are you looking for?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.896
Oh, um...
my credit card bill.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.398
Other people with
the same credit card company

08:51.498 --> 08:54.034
have already been emailed
their statements.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.736
Do you see that panic?

08:55.836 --> 08:58.672
That is why we will
never go paperless.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.408
<i>E kaasan,</i> Auntie.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.010
<i>Kaasan,</i> Morenike.
You look nice.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.146
I have an interview
at the new hospital across town.

09:06.246 --> 09:10.517
The fancy one where
the mayor got his colonoscopy.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.152
You must get this job.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.088
It is the first step to you
becoming the best in your field.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.423
Yes, Auntie.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.792
Even if you do not,
you will be fine.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.195
Well... no.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.331
She would be an embarrassment.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.599
Of course.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.067
But because
something is the best,

09:27.167 --> 09:29.169
does not mean
it's the only option.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.872
Eh? Maybe God has other plans.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.113
Very funny, Abishola.

09:40.213 --> 09:44.451
A-As if anything less than
the best is acceptable.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.221
Can you imagine?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.057
To fail my family
and the community

09:50.157 --> 09:51.491
and just say "whoopsie"?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.134
This house has a nice big yard.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.738
Perfect place
to put yourself out to pasture.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.606
I'm still gonna be
taking care of things.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.842
And if I put my office
in this unfinished basement,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.443
and run the washer and dryer,

10:10.543 --> 10:12.279
it'll feel like
I never left the factory.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.781
You see the problem here?

10:13.881 --> 10:17.417
I know that
you don't believe you.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.920
Okay, fine.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.955
Look, I just brought
manufacturing back to Detroit.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.324
I deserve to stick around
and enjoy that ride.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.193
Don't tell me, tell her.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.061
Hey, honey.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.632
I didn't think you wanted me
eating like that.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.101
These are not for you.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.703
Anybody else coming?

10:35.803 --> 10:38.171
'Cause I'm pretty sure
that's the family feast.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.506
Ooh, I'll take one.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.174
These are my fries!

10:42.375 --> 10:43.811
What is going on?

10:43.911 --> 10:44.712
Nothing.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.513
You're talking to a guy

10:46.613 --> 10:47.848
who's eaten his way
through those bags

10:47.948 --> 10:49.950
on more than one occasion.

10:50.050 --> 10:50.951
What's up?

10:54.121 --> 10:57.024
I never heard
from Johns Hopkins.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.360
Which means I did not get in.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.463
Aw, honey. Come here.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.871
Now you don't have to move!

11:10.971 --> 11:13.073
And you didn't have
to be honest.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.809
Go ahead, stroke her back.
Really sell it.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.157
Okay.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.192
Patient in 422
needs assistance.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.661
How can we work
at a time like this?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.530
My friend is a failure.

11:37.630 --> 11:38.766
They should ask

11:38.866 --> 11:40.067
to speak with a doctor,

11:40.167 --> 11:41.935
which clearly I am not.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.571
No, you are not.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.639
You know, if our roles
were reversed,

11:46.740 --> 11:48.976
you'd tell me to stop moping
and focus on work.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.080
At least I give good advice.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.119
I miss angry Abishola.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.155
This pathetic one is a buzzkill.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.391
Give her time,
she'll be all right.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.393
She has never failed before.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.629
We are in uncharted waters
of mediocrity.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.033
We need to be supportive
and build her up.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.301
That is going to be difficult

12:14.401 --> 12:16.603
when I can barely
look her in the eye.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.605
Oh, hello!

12:18.705 --> 12:20.841
The patient wanted
the TV remote,

12:20.941 --> 12:24.011
which luckily
I am qualified for.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.013
Yes, you are.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.181
Listen to me.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.350
You are smarter
and more compassionate

12:30.450 --> 12:32.219
than half the doctors
in this hospital.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.755
They are the half that
did not go to Johns Hopkins.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.825
I know things look bleak now,

12:37.925 --> 12:41.028
but after the storm comes
a beautiful rainbow.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.729
Right, Kemi?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.498
Eh.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.400
Kemi!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.402
Abishola.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.971
Listen to me.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.573
Where you study
does not define you.

12:53.673 --> 12:54.574
What is important

12:54.674 --> 12:56.143
is your family

12:56.243 --> 12:57.878
and the friends
you surround yourself with.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.512
I am lying.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.281
The most prestigious school
in the country has rejected you.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.450
Your life is over.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.153
I'm surprised
you can even look at me.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.588
You see? She gets it.

13:11.091 --> 13:14.594
I got you a tea
and a lemon bar.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.329
Just the tea, thank you.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.866
All right. Cookie?
Cake pop?

13:19.699 --> 13:22.069
How many baked goods
do you have?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.370
I just wanted to help
cheer you up.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.940
Ugh. Failure does not deserve confectionary.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.141
Failure?

13:28.241 --> 13:31.011
Would I hug a failure?
Get in here.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.914
You know, instead of thinking
about what didn't work out,

13:34.014 --> 13:36.649
how about we focus on
what you got already.

13:36.749 --> 13:41.221
If you say "supportive husband,"
I will smush your cake pop.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.024
How about a job working
with your best friends,

13:44.124 --> 13:46.226
the beautiful home
we've made together?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.528
We would have made a new home
in Baltimore.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.463
Mm. Detroit's where we met,

13:50.563 --> 13:52.165
where our family lives.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.234
Plus, what would
this bench do without us?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.170
I suppose it would have been
hard to leave.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.538
Especially now.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.806
What do you mean?

14:00.707 --> 14:03.143
Just everything's
really clicking here.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.477
Life's good.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.313
And it would not have been good
in Baltimore?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.049
Bail. Bail right now.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.183
I'm not saying that.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.651
Then what are you saying?

14:11.751 --> 14:13.020
Repeat after me:

14:13.120 --> 14:15.555
"I was excited to go and
I'm sad that this happened."

14:15.655 --> 14:17.490
It's just, the factory's
up and running.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.592
I'm about to close the
biggest deal of my career.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.429
Stop freaking talking, Bobby!

14:22.529 --> 14:24.231
So you did not want to go?

14:24.331 --> 14:26.233
Well, the timing wouldn't
have been great.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.501
Why didn't you tell me
how you felt?

14:28.601 --> 14:30.971
'Cause I'm an idiot,
but I'm telling you now.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.805
'Cause you're an idiot.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.475
And if I did get in,
you would have been miserable?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.277
Well, it would have been
worth it 'cause I love you.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.879
But not enough for you
to be honest with me.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.848
Good thing I did not
achieve my dreams,

14:41.949 --> 14:43.550
so you can be happy.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.055
Don't say it.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.324
What?
You really cheered her up.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.632
If we want to woo
a corporation like Hanes,

14:59.732 --> 15:04.671
our marketing strategy needs to
be bigger, bolder, sexier.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.840
While also kissing the butt
of our new cash cow.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.377
Right. So when you buy
one pair of underwear,

15:10.477 --> 15:14.314
you get a free pair
of MaxDot socks because...

15:14.414 --> 15:16.749
We cover everything.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.221
What's the point of any of this?

15:21.321 --> 15:24.391
Okay, thank you
for your feedback.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.626
Sorry, can we do this later?

15:26.726 --> 15:29.496
Sure.
We can table our pursuit

15:29.596 --> 15:32.632
of one of the largest apparel
companies in the country

15:32.732 --> 15:35.135
until you're
in the right headspace.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.336
Great idea.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.405
Oh, that idea he likes.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.107
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.374
Go ahead. No.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.609
Ladies first.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.077
No, I insist.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.845
No, I insist.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.614
I insist! Get out!

15:49.482 --> 15:51.084
If those two
ain't bumping uglies,

15:51.184 --> 15:53.386
they will be soon.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.024
You won. Move on.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.026
I really hurt Abishola.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.395
The next time you feel like
unburdening your soul,

16:02.495 --> 16:03.696
just drink.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.698
The guilt would still be there.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.635
Yeah, but you can't hear it
when it's drowning in booze.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.939
Abishola's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.408
If she's not happy,
I'll never be happy, either.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.010
Oh, come on.
You don't believe that.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.778
Yeah, I do.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.082
Huh.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.451
I really do.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.460
<i>E kaale,</i> Mummy.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.528
Are you starting dinner soon,

16:35.628 --> 16:37.230
or do you plan on
letting Colonel Sanders

16:37.330 --> 16:39.566
do your wifely duties?

16:39.666 --> 16:42.135
Um, may I speak with you first?

16:42.235 --> 16:46.806
Not now. I'm about to find out
which Disney princess I am.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.108
Yes, Mummy.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.977
Belle?

16:54.347 --> 16:57.284
I, um...

16:57.384 --> 17:00.520
I did not get into
Johns Hopkins.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.391
Oh.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.494
I failed you.
I-I am so sorry.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.696
Sit.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.865
I will photoshop a picture of me
in a white coat

17:12.965 --> 17:15.635
for you to share
with your friends on WhatsApp.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.571
Do you know why I spent
my entire life

17:18.671 --> 17:21.974
pushing you to be
the undeniable best?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.777
You wanted me to succeed.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.281
Because I knew
you had greatness in you.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.749
I knew it

17:29.849 --> 17:32.185
from the moment you were born.
Really?

17:32.285 --> 17:34.887
You did not bother crawling
before you walked.

17:34.987 --> 17:38.458
You taught your older
brother to read.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.860
You are strong, Abishola.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.931
You have overcome things
I could never even imagine.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.301
I am proud

17:48.401 --> 17:50.069
of the woman you have become.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.906
No acceptance letter
could ever change that.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.844
Thank you, Mummy.

18:00.213 --> 18:04.151
Besides, there is still hope
for the Ivy League.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.685
Hmm.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.921
I think it's too late for me,
at least this year.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.190
I meant Dele.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.558
Someone has to

18:11.658 --> 18:13.726
take this family
to the next level.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.629
I will let him know
he's our last hope.

18:16.729 --> 18:21.734
Drill it into his little
dreadlocked head.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.103
Yes, Mummy. Mm.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.647
How you feeling?

18:34.747 --> 18:37.550
I'm feeling blah.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.720
I finally understand
why Americans say that.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.256
I'm pretty blah, too.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.861
Is that true or are you hiding
something else from me?

18:50.397 --> 18:51.998
Okay, fine.

18:54.301 --> 18:58.070
I ate all the baked goods
I got you earlier.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.974
You know I'd never want you
to be unhappy.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.343
Well, that's just it.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.313
If there's a smile on your face,
then I'm golden.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.914
But it does not make me happy
for you to do things

19:08.014 --> 19:09.549
that only make me happy.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.552
Sounds like one of us
needs to be more selfish.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.321
Not it.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.195
Not now, we're snuggling.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.831
From Johns Hopkins.
Get off me and open it!

19:24.931 --> 19:27.267
There's a link.
Okay. Click the link.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.835
It's loading.
What takes longer?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.069
A yes or a no?
There you go.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.671
Hurry, prove you're
not a robot.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.039
I am not a robot!

19:33.139 --> 19:34.907
You missed a motorcycle.
Take, take, take, take.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.310
Okay.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.546
"We are pleased to inform you
that you have been accepted

19:39.646 --> 19:42.282
to Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine."

19:42.382 --> 19:45.051
Oh, my God.
"You are clearly
the most qualified,

19:45.151 --> 19:47.053
"capable, and
beautiful applicant

19:47.153 --> 19:48.955
this school has ever seen."
That last part was me.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.823
You did it!
I did it!

19:50.923 --> 19:52.124
This is amazing!

19:52.225 --> 19:54.227
I'm so proud of you!

19:54.327 --> 19:57.530
Oh! But you do not want to go.
I really don't.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.500
What are we going to do?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.735
I have no idea.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.637
But whatever happens,

20:04.737 --> 20:07.540
we're gonna be fine.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.276
You sure about that, champ?
