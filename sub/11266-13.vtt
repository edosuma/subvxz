WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:04.797
Previously on 90210:
Cousin Emily gets in today.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.090
(squealing laughter)

00:07.132 --> 00:10.719
We are going to have the best
time together, aren't we?

00:10.761 --> 00:12.930
I've loved you for a long time.

00:12.972 --> 00:16.642
ANNIE:
I just slept with my
boyfriend's brother.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.852
I'm going to break up
with Charlie.
Don't.

00:17.893 --> 00:18.894
What's going on?

00:18.936 --> 00:20.980
I finally have my brother back.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.774
If we got together,
it would ruin that.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.860
My friendship with you
was like the only thing
that made me happy.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.319
I feel it, too.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.948
ADRIANNA:
Victor betrayed me.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.701
It's all over the Internet
that I stole Javier's notebook.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.785
My life is over.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.043
(sighs, taps computer keys)

00:44.085 --> 00:45.462
(door opens, footsteps)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.925
The paparazzi are back.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.969
I shooed them
off the front lawn,

00:52.011 --> 00:55.514
but now they're just standing
in the driveway.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.766
I can't believe
this is happening, Mom.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.977
I don't know
what to do.

01:00.019 --> 01:02.521
I'm a national joke.
I can't even leave my house.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.605
I think you should
sell your story.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.525
What?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.819
The record label is trying to
get back your entire advance.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.362
Plus, you still
owe a fortune

01:10.404 --> 01:12.447
on that absurd
house you rented.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.533
You might as well make
some money while you can.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.493
I don't know.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.996
Well, it worked
for Lindsay Lohan.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.665
Once she got out of
jail, she got, like,

01:21.707 --> 01:23.166
$500,000 for her
first interview.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.920
My publicist isn't even
returning my calls.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.796
It's okay.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.631
A reporter from one of the
tabloids called this morning.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.090
He wants to do

01:31.132 --> 01:32.426
an exclusive interview.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.513
Here's his
phone number.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.097
Just think about it.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.316
Hey.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.860
Hey.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.992
Couldn't wait to come
over here and do that.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.577
(sighs)

01:58.619 --> 02:00.913
God, you're so beautiful.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.831
(scoffs)

02:02.873 --> 02:04.207
No, stop.

02:06.418 --> 02:07.795
What?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.964
I can't do this anymore.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.632
Silver...

02:11.673 --> 02:13.508
Look, this last
week with you

02:13.550 --> 02:16.011
has been amazing.

02:16.053 --> 02:19.556
Honestly, you're all
I think about anymore.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.142
But the moment you
walk out that door,

02:22.183 --> 02:25.729
I am sick to my stomach
with guilt.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.066
I'm not eating,
I'm not sleeping.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.068
I can't live like this,
Navid. This isn't me,

02:31.110 --> 02:33.528
and I'm not going to do
this to Adrianna.
It's okay.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.196
I told you, I'm going to
break up with Adrianna today.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.490
She can handle it now.
The worst is over.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.658
Then what?

02:37.699 --> 02:38.700
What do you mean?

02:38.742 --> 02:40.035
We just start dating?

02:40.077 --> 02:41.745
She'd never forgive
either of us.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.998
I mean, it'd kill her.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.165
Okay, so, so we wait.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.834
We-we keep it to ourselves

02:46.875 --> 02:48.543
for a while.
For how long?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.796
A week, a month?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.506
She's never going
to be okay with this.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.716
At least we can stop now
before we slept together.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.927
Silver, come on...
No, look, I've given
this a lot of thought.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.805
I can't keep running around
behind her back with you.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.432
It's too much for me.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.815
Hey, Charlie, I'm taking off.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.941
I'll see you tonight.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.526
Later.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.277
(knocking)

03:17.447 --> 03:19.198
Hey.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.701
Hi.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.165
Charlie's in his room.

03:26.205 --> 03:29.584
Okay. Thanks.

03:30.752 --> 03:34.422
Well... bye.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.924
Bye.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.099
Charlie.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.518
Hey.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.853
Hey.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.274
So I was thinking maybe today

03:53.316 --> 03:55.777
we could finally do that hike
in Griffith Park.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.739
Um, we-we need to talk.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.782
We do, huh?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.790
Um, I like you
a lot, Charlie.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.168
I like you, too.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.587
But we have to stop
seeing each other.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.005
I'm sorry.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.259
I thought things
were good with us.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.886
Well, up until
last week.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.928
It seemed like suddenly

04:21.970 --> 04:23.055
something changed.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.223
Did I do something?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.183
No, no, nothing.

04:26.225 --> 04:29.644
I'm-- I'm, I'm just
really busy with school

04:29.686 --> 04:32.022
and my family and stuff,
and I just don't think

04:32.064 --> 04:34.858
I have time for a relationship
right now.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.068
Is there someone else?

04:36.110 --> 04:38.904
No, nothing like that at all.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.030
It's just me.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.204
Well, this sucks.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.793
Yeah, I know.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.878
I'm really sorry.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.298
Me, too.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.221
Well, I... I guess
I should go.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.150
$10,000?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.901
MAN (on phone):
That's it.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.736
But I'm giving you
an exclusive.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.863
There's just not a lot
of new information there.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.702
NAOMI:
So what is this flash
of genius you had?

05:27.744 --> 05:30.247
Since winter break
is almost done,

05:30.289 --> 05:33.792
and our Mr. Cannon nightmare
is finally finished...
Thank God.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.170
Thank God.
I thought we should all
get away for the weekend.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.378
Bacara. I love it.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.381
We can stay at my usual suite--
my treat.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.885
Klaus gives the most amazing
deep tissue massages ever.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.264
No. I was thinking we could go
on a yoga retreat up in Ojai.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.266
Ooh.
It's called the Shining Tree.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.185
It's run by this
super famous guru.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.978
Guru Sona.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.980
It's basically like
a spa in the woods.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.940
Plus, they have this thing

05:56.982 --> 05:58.775
called a sweat lodge.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.361
It's supposed to be this
incredibly intense, cathartic,

06:02.403 --> 06:04.656
spiritual experience.
You had me at spa.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.783
I'm in. I've always wanted
to go to a yoga retreat.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.660
Awesome. I really need
a break from my life.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.995
ADRIANNA:
You won't believe this.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.955
The paparazzi just
followed me here.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.623
One of them snuck
into the Beach Club

06:13.665 --> 06:15.209
dressed up as a waiter
and started snapping pictures.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.960
Wow.
Oh, my God.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.670
Why won't they just
leave me alone?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.005
This whole thing is so unfair.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.631
Sucks.
Yeah.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.423
Yeah.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.469
Hey, I got something

06:26.511 --> 06:28.471
that might take your mind
off your problems.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.891
How would you feel about
getting out of town with us

06:30.932 --> 06:32.351
for a couple days

06:32.391 --> 06:34.811
to an amazing, paparazzi-free
yoga retreat?

06:34.853 --> 06:36.230
Oh, my God, I would love to.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.231
Perfect.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.397
It's settled.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.900
Girls' weekend.
Yeah!

06:39.941 --> 06:42.152
Salud.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.324
Uh, you're not moving
to Ojai, are you?

06:47.366 --> 06:51.161
I've never been
to a yoga retreat.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.829
I didn't know
what to bring.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.413
Oh, I'm pretty sure
you won't need this.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.041
Thank you

06:56.083 --> 06:57.209
for inviting Emily.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.877
You made me.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.005
I know, but I still appreciate
it when you do what I tell you.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.341
Oh. Well, I'm just hoping
that some yoga

07:04.383 --> 07:06.176
and that meditation
will chill her out,

07:06.218 --> 07:08.053
because she's really
been getting on my nerves.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.389
EMILY:
I'm home!

07:10.430 --> 07:11.723
Really.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.516
We're in the kitchen.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.277
Oh, your hair looks nice.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.861
Thanks. I really love it.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.446
I just bought the cutest
new yoga pants.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.115
I'm gonna go try them on.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.824
B-R-B.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.743
Oh...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.287
Oh... Oh, my God!

07:33.328 --> 07:35.122
Don't overreact.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.873
Don't-don't overreact?

07:36.915 --> 07:40.210
She-she borrows my clothes
and my perfume and my jewelry

07:40.252 --> 07:44.047
and my makeup, and last night
I saw her using my deodorant,

07:44.089 --> 07:46.258
but this-- she's
Single White Femaling me.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.135
Annie, you should be flattered.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.886
She looks up to you.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.346
Sh-She just wants
to be like you.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.890
Dixon, will you please
back me up on this.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.018
Uh, look, I-I don't know,

07:57.060 --> 07:58.270
it is a little weird,

07:58.312 --> 08:00.105
but it's just her hair.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.274
Oh, come on, guys.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.235
I have tried to give Emily
the benefit of the doubt, okay?

08:05.277 --> 08:07.570
I have, but this is too much.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.489
Sh-She's weird and
clingy, and I just wish

08:09.530 --> 08:11.783
she would get her own life

08:11.825 --> 08:13.827
and stop trying to steal mine!

08:41.062 --> 08:43.023
Ojai, here we come!

08:43.063 --> 08:45.608
(whooping)

08:48.862 --> 08:51.531
(car horn honking)

09:00.081 --> 09:03.377
Whoo, yeah!

09:03.418 --> 09:05.462
Here we are, ladies.

09:05.504 --> 09:08.548
Who's ready to get
their Om on?

09:17.015 --> 09:20.018
NAOMI:
Um, you know it's not too late

09:20.060 --> 09:22.020
to book a room at Bacara.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.147
Naomi, this is going to be fun.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.357
Embrace the experience.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.485
ANNIE:
I like it.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.195
Reminds me of summer camp.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.446
What do you think, Emily?

09:31.488 --> 09:32.697
It's fine.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.116
Oh, my God!

09:35.158 --> 09:36.284
What?
You okay?

09:36.326 --> 09:38.203
Ashton Kutcher is no longer

09:38.245 --> 09:39.829
following me
on Twitter.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.039
(sighs)

09:41.081 --> 09:43.417
WOMAN:
Welcome to the Shining Tree.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.585
I am Guru Sona.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.087
Namaste.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.047
ALL:
Namaste.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.007
I hope that you will
find your stay here

09:51.049 --> 09:55.178
both physically and spiritually
rewarding.

09:55.220 --> 10:00.975
Like spring buds, you are
here to blossom and bloom.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.561
NAOMI (laughs):
Yep. and are

10:02.602 --> 10:04.479
those the private bungalows

10:04.521 --> 10:06.064
we were promised?
Yes.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.066
One per guest.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.484
They are angled perfectly
to wake you

10:09.526 --> 10:10.985
with the earliest morning sun.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.904
Fantastic.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.241
Now, if Warwick can
collect your cell phones.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.909
(to chant of Om):
Phones.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.246
(to chant of Om)
Phones.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.916
Phones. Let go
of the connection

10:24.958 --> 10:29.045
that binds you
to your everyday reality.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.464
By which I mean,

10:30.505 --> 10:32.507
let go of your cell phone.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.468
Oh, I can't give you my phone.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.052
WARWICK:
Sure you can.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.678
It's fun off the grid.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.931
GURU SONA:
The use of any electronic device

10:39.973 --> 10:41.182
is strictly prohibited.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.934
This is a place

10:42.976 --> 10:44.144
of reflection

10:44.185 --> 10:45.353
and disconnection

10:45.395 --> 10:46.354
from the outside world.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.114
Now, before you
take your bags

10:56.156 --> 10:57.324
to your bungalows...

10:57.365 --> 10:58.408
(coughs):
Tent.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.409
(giggles)

10:59.451 --> 11:00.577
You can proceed

11:00.619 --> 11:02.412
to the registration cabin

11:02.454 --> 11:04.539
where our staff will help you
plan your time here.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.583
I particularly recommend

11:06.625 --> 11:08.168
tomorrow night's sweat lodge.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.003
Not to be missed.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.004
Welcome...

11:11.045 --> 11:12.922
and enjoy.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.428
Ah...
So exciting!

11:20.221 --> 11:22.265
Knock-knock.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.808
Hi.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.186
You excited
for tomorrow?
Are you kidding?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.104
A night at home,
just the two of us?

11:28.146 --> 11:30.524
No sneaking around, no paranoia?
Sounds wonderful.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.067
I don't know. Without
all that stress and tension,

11:33.109 --> 11:34.944
what if it's just...
not that exciting?

11:34.986 --> 11:38.573
Mm, I think we'll find a way
to generate some excitement.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.158
Hmm.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.826
See you tomorrow night.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.206
NAOMI:
I just don't get it.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.291
It's supposed to put you
into a meditative place.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.626
To get you to a...

11:49.668 --> 11:51.085
state of inner peace.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.253
By walking around
in circles.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.630
It's a labyrinth.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.508
And it's a metaphor
for your journey through life.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.092
Did the guru slip
you something?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.427
'Cause you're
talking nonsense.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.845
Ade, you understand, right?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.889
Did either of you see a
computer in that cabin?

12:02.930 --> 12:05.016
I really need to check
my Web site for a second.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.601
SILVER:
I'm glad
you guys are finding this to be

12:06.643 --> 12:08.228
such an enriching experience.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.604
Oh look! Nuts and
berries for dinner.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.565
Give in to
the experience.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.358
The only thing
I want to give in to

12:13.400 --> 12:15.776
is a vodka martini
and a sexy park ranger.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.659
Hey, are you coming to dinner?

12:22.701 --> 12:25.579
No, I'm not hungry.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.206
(sighs)
Okay.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.249
What's your problem?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.625
Nothing.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.335
It's not nothing.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.421
You've been moping around and
you've barely said two words

12:34.462 --> 12:35.505
since we left Beverly Hills.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.173
If you don't want to be here,

12:37.215 --> 12:38.174
then you didn't have to come.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.136
Oh, no, Emily...

12:42.178 --> 12:44.681
I didn't mean that you
shouldn't... have come.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.099
I just mean that
you don't seem

12:46.140 --> 12:47.808
to be having
a very good time.

12:47.850 --> 12:52.272
I'm just finding it
really hard to fit in.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.981
I'm not as cool as you.

12:54.023 --> 12:58.152
Look, I totally understand
what you're going through.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.113
No, you don't.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.656
I really do.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.075
When I first moved
to Beverly Hills,

13:04.117 --> 13:06.035
I felt like
such an outsider.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.662
You?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.581
Totally.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.375
I thought that everyone here
was going to be shallow

13:12.417 --> 13:15.378
and superficial, and
no one would be as genuine

13:15.420 --> 13:16.755
as my friends in Kansas.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.339
I-I didn't think that
I had the right clothes

13:18.381 --> 13:20.091
or the right shoes...

13:20.133 --> 13:20.967
or the right hair.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.803
Thought everyone hated me.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.931
But then I lived here
for a little while,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.517
and I realized that people here
are just as nice and genuine

13:29.559 --> 13:31.770
as the people back home.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.897
They're just much richer
and better dressed.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.525
Really?

13:37.567 --> 13:39.110
I swear.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.445
Just gotta give it some time.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.031
Okay.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.408
Okay.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.160
Now. Come on.
I'm starving.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.078
(laughs)

14:01.341 --> 14:03.217
Is this a bug?

14:03.259 --> 14:04.594
Oh, my God, they're
feeding us bugs.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.346
It's a date.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.682
Yeah, well, it tastes like
a bug, and I don't like bugs.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.517
I like...
room service and...

14:10.558 --> 14:12.435
seaweed infusion,

14:12.477 --> 14:13.561
full-body massages...

14:13.603 --> 14:15.271
ANNIE:
Naomi,

14:15.313 --> 14:16.314
it's not that bad.
Here.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.483
Try some grated beetroot.
Ugh.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.859
You have to stay
for the sweat lodge.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.278
It's supposed to be...
really incredible.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.322
I do not sweat.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.324
I perspire lightly.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.867
GURU SONA:
Before we begin our feast,

14:27.908 --> 14:29.869
I would like us all
to close our eyes,

14:29.910 --> 14:31.412
bow our heads,

14:31.454 --> 14:33.289
and offer a chant

14:33.331 --> 14:35.208
of gratitude.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.585
♪ Loka ♪

14:37.627 --> 14:40.755
♪ Samasta ♪

14:40.797 --> 14:42.465
♪ Sukhino ♪

14:42.507 --> 14:45.468
♪ Bhavantu ♪

14:45.510 --> 14:47.387
Why should I be grateful?

14:47.428 --> 14:49.764
I've lost everything I've spent
my entire life working for.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.307
It's so unfair.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.143
You know, Ade, it really
isn't that unfair.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.562
What?

14:55.603 --> 14:56.604
Naomi...

14:56.646 --> 14:58.523
No, she's right.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.607
It's enough already.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.025
What do you mean?

15:01.067 --> 15:03.319
No one forced you to
steal a dead guy's songs

15:03.361 --> 15:05.363
and pass them off
as your own.
What are
you saying?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.448
She's saying that you did a
really awful, unethical thing.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.200
You got caught, and now
you're paying the price.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.326
I'm saying

15:10.368 --> 15:11.411
you had it coming.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.912
I can't believe this.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.289
Is that what you think, too,
Annie? That I've had it coming?

15:15.331 --> 15:16.457
Uh, well...

15:16.499 --> 15:17.709
I mean...

15:17.751 --> 15:19.919
What you did was
sort of twisted.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.256
So all of you guys think
that I'm some horrible person?

15:23.297 --> 15:24.591
I thought I could count on you.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.342
I thought that my friends

15:26.384 --> 15:27.844
would be able to
stand behind me

15:27.886 --> 15:29.470
through the worst time
of my life.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.265
Oh, my God!
I...

15:32.306 --> 15:33.850
All we've done
is support you.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.852
And believe me,
it hasn't been easy.
Okay, well,

15:35.894 --> 15:37.604
I'm sorry
for being such a burden.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.230
SILVER:
What you should be sorry for
is turning into

15:39.272 --> 15:40.440
such a vain, self-absorbed,

15:40.481 --> 15:41.858
bitch that none of us
can even stand

15:41.900 --> 15:42.817
to be around you.
Preach it, sister.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.736
Guys, come on.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.696
You know what? I knew you guys
couldn't handle my fame.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.988
I knew you guys were jealous.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.699
NAOMI: Oh, yeah, really?
Gosh, because all

15:49.741 --> 15:50.867
I ever wanted to do
was someday get

15:50.909 --> 15:52.869
into a car accident
with a big pop star,

15:52.911 --> 15:54.746
so I could steal his music
and be just like you.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.664
I don't need to listen to this.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.303
That's it.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.473
Now, hug your knees
around your ears.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.933
NAOMI:
What is the point of doing this

16:14.974 --> 16:16.517
if there's no guys
around to watch?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.394
INSTRUCTOR:
Focus on your breathing.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.605
This is called karnapidasana.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.607
I can't feel my feet.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.317
EMILY:
Or my hands.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.777
I-I don't think

16:25.819 --> 16:27.862
my body's supposed
to bend like this.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.281
(breathes deeply)

16:30.323 --> 16:31.825
Just breathe.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.576
Now slowly roll down,

16:33.618 --> 16:36.203
one vertebrae at a time.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.873
Make your way into a comfortable
sitting position.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.542
Thank God.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.798
Namaste.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.342
CLASS:
Namaste.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.510
Namaste.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.473
I trust that everyone
is enjoying themselves?

16:55.515 --> 16:56.808
Absolutely.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.351
It's great.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.894
Where is Adrianna?

16:59.936 --> 17:02.396
Oh, probably trying to Tweet
with a rock and a twig.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.523
So are you all ready for the
hike up the Mountain of Fire?

17:04.565 --> 17:05.983
I can't wait.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.568
I miss Klaus.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.362
I will see you there.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.823
I'm going to
get some water.
Right behind you.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.907
Uh, you know,
as delightful as

17:13.950 --> 17:15.702
walking up a mountain
of fire sounds,

17:15.742 --> 17:17.744
I think I'm just going
to take a nap instead.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.998
Can you make sure you wake me
up for the sweat lodge?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.375
Absolutely.
Thanks.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.969
♪ ♪

17:40.059 --> 17:42.395
Seriously, dude,
you should go pro.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.730
You're ridiculous.

17:43.771 --> 17:44.898
I'm just getting lucky, man.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.357
I'm embarrassing
myself out here.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.028
All right.
Here we go.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.404
What's going on, man?

17:51.445 --> 17:54.532
You look like
your dog died.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.034
Annie broke up
with me yesterday.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.327
Really.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.704
Yeah.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.999
Wow.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.043
I really liked
her, you know?
Yeah, I know.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.004
I'm sorry.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.673
Thanks.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.466
Do you know if she's
seeing someone else?

18:14.134 --> 18:15.469
No.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.222
She said there was
no one else, I just...

18:18.264 --> 18:20.474
I don't know, I got this feeling
that maybe there was.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.019
Anyway, now I got to
figure out what to do

18:23.061 --> 18:24.395
about this semester in Paris.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.855
Paris?

18:25.897 --> 18:27.231
Yeah. I wasn't planning on going

18:27.273 --> 18:28.816
because things were going
so good with Annie,

18:28.858 --> 18:31.402
but now that we're not
together... I thought maybe...

18:31.444 --> 18:32.987
I'll go.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.073
Anyway, I got to
figure it out quick,

18:35.114 --> 18:37.033
because the semester
starts next week.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.367
Next week?

18:38.409 --> 18:39.660
(snorts)

18:39.702 --> 18:41.370
That's not a lot of time.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.873
I know.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.835
Well, do whatever you want
to do, you know, but...

18:47.877 --> 18:51.047
for what it's worth,
I kind of hope you stay.

18:51.089 --> 18:54.092
Kind of enjoying having my
big brother around, you know?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.260
Me, too, man.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.388
Oh, yeah?

19:01.515 --> 19:02.934
You swear.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.853
Dixon, I promise
I'd tell you

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
if I thought your chest
was getting too big.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.358
Yeah, but look, I just been
working out really hard lately,

19:11.400 --> 19:13.111
and I'm worried that it's
starting to look weird.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.737
I'll tell you
what's weird,

19:14.779 --> 19:16.114
uh, this conversation
is weird.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.531
I don't want to talk about
your man-boobs anymore.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.159
(laughs)
Look, you just got to
start hitting the gym

19:20.200 --> 19:21.828
with me, man.
Yeah, I rea...
I really don't.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.997
Navid... I need your help.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.873
I can't find Adrianna.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.750
She's not answering her phone;
I don't know where she is.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.711
Whoa, slow down. What's, what's
the matter? What's going on?

19:30.753 --> 19:32.171
Adrianna transferred

19:32.212 --> 19:34.048
the rest of her money
into my bank account,

19:34.090 --> 19:36.509
to keep it from being seized
by the record company,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.552
but she forgot to sign one
of the papers, so the bank

19:38.594 --> 19:40.054
is refusing
to complete the transfer.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.722
She's got to sign
these right away.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.599
It's okay, Constance, I know
where she is. She's up in Ojai.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.559
Ojai?!

19:45.601 --> 19:49.022
Oh, God, I can't drive to Ojai;
I have to work.

19:49.063 --> 19:52.525
No problem. Uh...
I'll take it up to her.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.651
You will?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.194
Of course.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.071
Oh, thank you, Navid.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.073
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.537
There goes your future
mother-in-law.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.663
(repressed chuckle)

20:05.705 --> 20:07.247

♪ Om, shanti, shanti ♪

20:12.795 --> 20:13.838
♪ Shanti, om... ♪

20:13.880 --> 20:16.174
This is super weird.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.051
What, the music?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.218
It's beautiful!

20:19.259 --> 20:21.261
NAOMI:
Not just the music.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.056
Everything. You're not
just a little creeped out

20:23.097 --> 20:24.932
that we're spending
our vacation

20:24.974 --> 20:26.934
handling dead animal skins?

20:26.976 --> 20:29.436
It's Native American tradition.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.815
But, yeah. It's really starting
to creep me out, too.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.109
You know, back in Kansas,
I used to go hunting

20:35.151 --> 20:36.110
with my family out
in Flint Hills.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.778
We had to gut
our own kills,

20:37.820 --> 20:38.905
so this is really
nothing for me.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.785
Thank you, Warwick.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.747
Thank you, Guru Sona.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.665
Nice work, ladies.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.042
We are about to share

20:51.084 --> 20:52.835
a very profound experience.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.046
Adapted from Native American
rituals, the sweat lodge

20:55.088 --> 20:57.006
is a place of healing

20:57.048 --> 21:00.551
for your mind, your body
and your spirit,

21:00.593 --> 21:01.761
where you can discover

21:01.802 --> 21:03.137
your inner truth.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.223
This is a
sacred place,

21:05.264 --> 21:08.184
where you are free to be you.

Hey.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.817
Sorry I'm late.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.318
GURU SONA:
I'm glad you came.

Hey, where's Annie?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.706
Oh, she wanted to sleep;
she asked me not to wake her.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.057
Go on, Susan.

21:48.099 --> 21:49.976
Tell us how that made you feel.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.479
Useless.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.276
I couldn't be
a mother, but, um...

21:58.317 --> 21:59.944
I was still his wife,

21:59.986 --> 22:02.029
and I still had value.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.697
You are infinitely
valuable.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.617
This is not your fault.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.701
I know.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.287
(Susan sobs quietly)

22:09.328 --> 22:10.704
I know.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.083
Thank you.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.210
Thank you, Susan...

Adrianna,

22:25.178 --> 22:27.345
tell us what's
in your heart.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.974
What pain are you carrying
that you wish to release?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.350
Unburden yourself.

22:32.392 --> 22:36.480
Um, I don't know.

22:36.522 --> 22:41.068
I guess I've been going through
a really rough time lately.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.112
And what has been your role?

22:43.154 --> 22:44.905
What do you mean?

22:44.947 --> 22:46.240
Oh, we are creators.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.825
Our lives do not simply
happen to us.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.160
We are in control,

22:49.202 --> 22:50.410
so what has been your role?

22:53.331 --> 22:57.710
I guess I have...
done some unethical things,

22:57.751 --> 23:00.921
some really unethical things.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.341
Why? What did you
hope to gain?

23:03.381 --> 23:07.094
Everything:
fame, money, success.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.222
But why?
To what end?

23:09.263 --> 23:12.432
What void
are you trying to fill?

23:12.474 --> 23:16.729
I guess I just want
to feel important...

23:16.770 --> 23:18.396
to matter.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.357
You don't feel
that you're important?

23:19.439 --> 23:20.816
You don't feel that you matter?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.818
No, no, no, I... I do.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.446
But I've sacrificed so much.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.782
It has to be for something
greater, you know?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.743
I dropped out
of school.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.914
I gave up so much time
with my friends and family

23:34.955 --> 23:37.208
and other things.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.792
What other things?

23:43.339 --> 23:47.467
Well, two years ago,
I got pregnant,

23:47.509 --> 23:51.931
and... I gave the
baby up for adoption.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.473
Um, I gave her up

23:53.515 --> 23:57.019
because I wasn't ready
to be a mother, you know?

23:57.061 --> 23:58.354
And I wanted...

23:58.396 --> 24:02.066
I wanted to do what was best
for her.

24:02.108 --> 24:07.821
But I guess I also wanted
a chance at living my life.

24:07.863 --> 24:11.075
you know, and
pursuing my dreams.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.244
I felt like
I was destined

24:13.286 --> 24:16.205
for greater things: stardom.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.250
All that made
sense back then.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.128
But now...

24:26.757 --> 24:27.841
(sighs)

24:29.427 --> 24:33.347
(voice breaking):
I mean, if I'm not...

24:35.433 --> 24:38.352
I mean, if I'm just gonna
be me...

24:38.394 --> 24:41.188
what did I give my baby up for?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.023
You know, why did I do that?

24:46.944 --> 24:50.948
I gave up my own child
for nothing.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.199
Ade...

24:52.241 --> 24:55.411
I'm... I'm sorry.
Hey...

24:55.453 --> 24:57.163
It's okay.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.873
(sobbing)

25:01.000 --> 25:02.376
(slight chuckle)

25:04.044 --> 25:05.087

Thank you,

25:05.129 --> 25:06.339
Adrianna, for sharing.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.049
You were very brave.

25:14.388 --> 25:15.431
Okay, the roasted potatoes
will be done

25:15.473 --> 25:16.514
in a couple of minutes,

25:16.556 --> 25:18.225
and then we'll
be ready to eat.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.186
Well, it all
looks delicious.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.895
Mmm, this wine
is wonderful.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.563
Oh, yeah, I'm glad
you like it.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.984
It's a 1987 Bordeaux
from the Cotes de Blaye region.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.610
It's a supple,

25:28.652 --> 25:30.279
full-bodied wine
with hints of fresh cherries

25:30.321 --> 25:31.447
delicately laced with oak

25:31.489 --> 25:34.492
to complement
the natural fruitiness.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.534
Wow, you know a lot about wine.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.287
Not really.
I just memorized the label

25:38.329 --> 25:40.456
on the way over to impress you.

25:40.498 --> 25:43.501
(chuckling): Well,
I'm very impressed

25:43.541 --> 25:44.877
by your memorization skills.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.337

Hey.
Hey.

25:57.555 --> 25:59.058
What's going on here?

25:59.099 --> 26:01.268
Oh, I just felt like cooking.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.353
Trying out some new recipes.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.562
Oh, good, I'm starving.

26:04.604 --> 26:08.984
What? Oh, I thought you and
Navid were hanging out tonight.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.111
Oh, we were, but, uh...
something came up,

26:11.153 --> 26:12.405
and he had to bail.

26:12.446 --> 26:16.325
Oh, man, this
smells amazing!

26:16.367 --> 26:17.951
I guess it's just me and you

26:17.993 --> 26:19.245

so, uh, let's eat.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.205
Oh, yeah, great.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.248
Let's eat.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.046

What do I want?

26:29.088 --> 26:29.713
Your deepest desire.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.469
Mm, okay.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.264
Well, I really want
to be a filmmaker.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.516
I'm hoping to get into NYU
next year.

26:40.558 --> 26:41.559
That'd be awesome.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.519
Dig deeper, Silver.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.979
I don't want facts,
I want emotions.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.147
You're holding back.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.190
What's in your heart?

26:48.232 --> 26:49.149
Share your feelings.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.318

26:54.612 --> 26:57.074
I don't really know.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.658

26:58.700 --> 27:01.161
Whatever is in your heart,
you can have it,

27:01.203 --> 27:02.996
but you have
to be willing
to state it plainly

27:03.038 --> 27:04.331
and clearly.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.208
I promise you that whatever

27:06.250 --> 27:08.377
you most deeply desire,

27:08.419 --> 27:09.462
you can manifest in your life.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.301
It's okay.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.844
Whatever it is, you can say it.

I'm, I'm, I'm really not feeling

Oh, I'm happy just listening

28:40.260 --> 28:42.095
This is a safe place.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.889
Oh, I know.

I just don't really feel

28:48.185 --> 28:50.229
It is often those
most resistant

28:50.270 --> 28:53.148
who have the most to gain
from this experience.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.983
I'm sure.

28:55.025 --> 28:58.278
Mm. We've all had pain,
we've all had heartache,

28:58.320 --> 29:00.072
we have all suffered.

this year.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.120
What is it?

29:07.162 --> 29:09.707
What happened?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.750
I really don't want
to get into it.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.253
Too painful?

29:23.095 --> 29:24.388
An old Cherokee chief

29:24.430 --> 29:25.847
was teaching his grandson
about life.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.267
"There's a great fight
going on inside all of us,"

29:28.308 --> 29:31.228
he told him.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.272
"And it's a fight
between two wolves.

29:33.313 --> 29:37.359
"One is evil.
He is anger, envy

29:37.401 --> 29:40.529
"guilt, sorrow
and ego.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.281
"And the other is good.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.658
"He is joy, love, hope,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.244
truth and faith."

29:48.662 --> 29:52.332
Grandson asked,
"Which wolf will win?"

29:52.374 --> 29:54.543
And the chief replied,

29:54.585 --> 29:56.920
"The one you feed."

30:01.425 --> 30:03.385
This is a chance, Naomi,

30:03.427 --> 30:05.387
for you to feed
the good wolf.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.105
I was raped.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.236
Um, but I'm okay.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.738
Really, I am.

30:22.780 --> 30:26.366
I've gotten through it.

30:26.408 --> 30:30.287
And that was incredibly hard
for a while,

30:30.329 --> 30:32.372
but I'm here,

30:32.414 --> 30:35.542
and he's in jail.

30:35.584 --> 30:38.337
And I've moved on.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.755
(slight chuckle)

30:39.797 --> 30:42.549
You should be very proud
of yourself.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.678
You've overcome
something

30:45.719 --> 30:47.596
truly horrific.

30:47.638 --> 30:50.557
You're a strong woman, Naomi.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.768
A survivor.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.730
Thank you.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.363
So what does this mean
moving forward?

31:04.404 --> 31:05.698
What do you mean?

31:05.739 --> 31:07.700
How will you grow
from this experience?

31:07.741 --> 31:13.372
Well, I guess if I could,
I'd like to help women and girls

31:13.413 --> 31:14.790
who've been through
the same thing

31:14.832 --> 31:16.709
Good, Naomi.
Good for you.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.627
That's wonderful.

31:18.669 --> 31:20.212
Yeah, I guess,
in general,

31:20.253 --> 31:23.298
I just like to do
something positive
with my life.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.550
Go on.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.344
Well...

31:27.386 --> 31:29.722
I've recently come
into a lot of money,

31:29.763 --> 31:31.640
and I could sit here all day

31:31.682 --> 31:33.809
and tell you how much I enjoy
spending it on myself.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.478
(all chuckle)
But I'd also like

31:36.520 --> 31:38.313
to make a difference
in the world.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.939
I've seen firsthand

31:39.981 --> 31:41.775
where wealth and aimlessness
can lead.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.611
Excellent, Naomi, excellent.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.613
You're on
a very positive,

31:46.655 --> 31:49.366
very spiritual path.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.368
Keep pursuing it.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.204
Thank you, Guru Sona.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.622
Namaste.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.499
Namaste. (chuckles)

32:00.293 --> 32:02.588
Now our journey here
is almost complete.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.256
I would like you all...

32:04.297 --> 32:06.800
I'm sorry. Can I just,
can I say something?

32:06.842 --> 32:09.344
Of course you can, Emily.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.264
I have to say
that this has been

32:12.305 --> 32:14.433
the most incredible
experience

32:14.474 --> 32:15.559
of my entire life.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.936
And I just want you guys to know

32:17.977 --> 32:20.814
that I think you are both
amazing, beautiful people.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.901
I mean, you have
been so kind to me,

32:23.942 --> 32:25.444
and I'm so grateful

32:25.485 --> 32:27.863
that you let me
be a part of this.

32:27.905 --> 32:32.826
You're not at all shallow
and superficial like Annie said.

32:32.868 --> 32:33.827
What?

32:33.869 --> 32:35.454
Oh, no, that's...

32:35.495 --> 32:36.789
that's not what she meant.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.749
She just said that
you're not as genuine

32:38.791 --> 32:40.292
as the people
we know in Kansas.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.462
Oh, this is coming out
all wrong!

32:43.503 --> 32:45.046
Please don't be mad
at Annie.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.090
I promised her that
I would never say anything

32:47.132 --> 32:49.468
when she talks about you guys
behind your backs.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.969
Please don't say
anything.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.888
No one is going to say anything.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.473
This is a safe place.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.725
Yeah, we won't say anything.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.560
Of course not.

32:58.602 --> 32:59.937
Thank you.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.482
GURU SONA:
Okay, let's close our eyes.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.609
Nice, deep breath.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.491
Why don't you cook
like this all the time?

33:12.532 --> 33:14.701
This is fantastic.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.578
Hmm, you're really
savoring every bite.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.747
You mind if I have

33:18.789 --> 33:20.624
that last piece of chicken?

33:20.666 --> 33:22.208
Oh, I don't see why not.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.336
Ooh!

33:24.377 --> 33:26.254
I'm gonna put on some
of those hot pepper flakes.

33:26.296 --> 33:27.422
Stop!

33:27.464 --> 33:29.007
Um...

33:29.048 --> 33:32.719
No, no, no. You...
you sit, I'll get it,

33:32.761 --> 33:34.972
because you are my prince
tonight.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.682
Can't argue with that.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.397
I'm so sorry.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.444
EMILY:
I just feel like the whole world

33:49.486 --> 33:50.570
should know
about Guru Sona.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.322
She should be
on Oprah or something.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.657
Oprah would totally love her.

33:53.699 --> 33:57.035
I've never met anybody so serene
and yet so powerful.

33:57.076 --> 33:59.788
She's like a hot, skinny
female Buddha.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.832
Hey, Emily.

34:01.874 --> 34:04.668
Why didn't you wake me up
for the sweat lodge?

34:04.710 --> 34:06.837
I-I thought you
wanted to sleep.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.005
I never said that.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.672
I'm sorry.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.717
There must have just
been a miscommunication.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.969
Well, I don't see how
that's really possible,

34:14.011 --> 34:15.387
because I was very clear--

34:15.428 --> 34:16.679
I said to wake me up

34:16.722 --> 34:17.931
before the sweat lodge.

34:17.973 --> 34:21.393
I... I thought you didn't
want me to wake you up.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.853
I specifically told
you to wake me!

34:23.896 --> 34:26.231
Hey, Annie, relax.
Geez, she made a mistake.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.945
It's okay, Emily.

34:40.704 --> 34:43.456
(laughing): I kept thinking,
I am going to pass out

34:43.498 --> 34:45.792
and totally face plant
into the hot coals."

34:45.833 --> 34:47.460
Or Guru Sona's lap.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.507
How are you feeling?

34:52.549 --> 34:54.051
Much better.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.969
Thanks. I... guess
I just needed some sleep.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.345
Navid?

34:57.387 --> 34:58.722
What?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.807
Oh, my God, it's you!

35:00.849 --> 35:02.059
What are you
doing here?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.727
Uh, your mom had
some important papers

35:03.769 --> 35:05.395
from the bank for you to sign,

35:05.437 --> 35:06.980
and she said
they just couldn't wait.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.066
She was really freaking out.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.443
So you just drove
all the way up here?

35:11.484 --> 35:12.569
You're incredible.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.030
Best boyfriend
in the world, ladies--

35:15.072 --> 35:16.114
right here.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.495
Here you go, girls.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.581
Yay. Yay. Yay.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.458
Yay. Yay.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.919
ADRIANNA:
Yes. Mm-hmm.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.430
Hmm, I don't know...

35:41.723 --> 35:43.433
Hey...

35:43.475 --> 35:44.810
Naomi, your phone.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.269
I don't need
mine right now.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.482
I've decided to stay.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.691
What?
Stay?

35:51.733 --> 35:53.610
I'm going to spend
the whole week up here.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.654
I really feel like I've
had some realizations,

35:55.695 --> 35:57.155
and I want to keep exploring.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.783
That's amazing.

35:59.825 --> 36:00.742
GURU SONA:
Well, you leave her

36:00.784 --> 36:01.952
in good hands.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.036
SILVER:
Okay.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.788
Have a good time.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.415
And don't eat too many bugs.

36:07.457 --> 36:08.458
Hey...

36:11.003 --> 36:13.130
Thanks for making me
come up here.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.090
I owe you one.

36:15.132 --> 36:16.424
My pleasure.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.511
Let's hit it.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.847
Have a safe trip back.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.687
(sighs)

36:28.728 --> 36:31.731
So what do you think
about my cooking?

36:31.773 --> 36:33.650
I think you should
stick to Ping-Pong.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.485
Oh, man, that's cold.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.695
I'm just kidding. It's good.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.571
Actually, I'm going
to get some more.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.493
(text message alert chimes)

37:06.432 --> 37:08.810
I don't remember the last time
I ate that much food.

37:08.852 --> 37:11.021
You really put it away.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.857
You're the best mom.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.692
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.198
Um, I guess I'm gonna go

37:21.239 --> 37:22.699
do some studying.

37:22.741 --> 37:23.783
You need some help
cleaning up?

37:23.825 --> 37:25.869
No. Uh-uh.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.746
Like I said, you are
my prince tonight.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.666
Okay, cool.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.001
(chuckles)

37:33.043 --> 37:34.502
Good night.
Good night.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.595
Hi.
Hey.

37:44.554 --> 37:45.722
(sighs)

37:46.848 --> 37:48.141
(sighs)

37:48.183 --> 37:49.768
I am so sorry, Ryan.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.561
I'm mortified.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.646
That was not how this evening
was supposed to go.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.774
It definitely wasn't.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.735
Look, I understand if you
don't want to keep seeing me,

37:58.777 --> 38:01.154
but I don't want the kids to
know I'm dating their teacher.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.697
No, I-I understand.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.157
But?

38:04.199 --> 38:05.575
No buts.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.244
I understand and I want
to keep seeing you,

38:07.285 --> 38:10.580
even if we have
to sneak around.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.790
(chuckles)

38:30.142 --> 38:32.060
(text message alert chimes)

38:43.905 --> 38:47.242
So, how do you feel?

38:47.284 --> 38:50.328
I feel amazing.

38:50.369 --> 38:54.624
From this day forward, your life
will never be the same.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.799
(knocking)

39:10.598 --> 39:12.517
Hi.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.726
Hey.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.228
Are you alone?

39:15.270 --> 39:16.188
Yeah. Come on in.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.650
I got your text.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.277
What text?

39:22.319 --> 39:24.029
The text you sent me.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.864
I didn't send you a text.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.074
Uh, yeah, you did.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.868
Here.

39:32.411 --> 39:35.165
"Come see me tomorrow.
We belong together."

39:35.207 --> 39:37.334
I swear
I didn't send this to you.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.669
Well, it came from your phone.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.341
Charlie must have sent it.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.800
Why would Charlie
send me this text

39:45.842 --> 39:47.719
from your phone?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.846
He said something
kind of cryptic

39:49.888 --> 39:51.264
this morning before he left.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.391
He told me
he wanted me to be happy

39:53.432 --> 39:55.018
and not feel like
I owed him anything.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.895
It seemed kind
of weird at the time,

39:56.936 --> 39:59.356
but now that he's gone...

39:59.397 --> 40:01.191
Wait, what do you mean
he's gone?

40:02.359 --> 40:06.029
He left this morning

40:06.071 --> 40:08.990
for a semester
in Paris.

40:09.032 --> 40:12.369
So, what does that mean?

40:12.410 --> 40:16.915
I guess Charlie thinks
we belong together.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.417
And what do you think?

40:34.807 --> 40:36.559
(dialing)

40:38.477 --> 40:40.021
(phone line ringing)

40:41.898 --> 40:43.149
MAN:
Hello.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.151
Hey, it's Adrianna.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.320
I have something for you,

40:47.362 --> 40:50.448
and I think it's worth
a lot more than $10,000.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.325
I'm listening.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.202
(sighs)

40:54.244 --> 40:56.288
I gave a baby up for adoption.

40:56.329 --> 40:57.997
That's good,

40:58.039 --> 40:59.749
but not good enough.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.251
Now, if you were trying to get

41:01.293 --> 41:04.421
your baby back,
that would be a big story.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.923
Well, I am trying.

41:06.965 --> 41:10.927
I want to get my baby back.
