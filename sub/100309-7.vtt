WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:02.460
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.860 --> 00:04.320
Stay away from my daughter.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.990
You have to go.
What?

00:05.990 --> 00:07.950
Your dad
was very clear.

00:07.950 --> 00:09.820
We're turning away
the very people

00:09.820 --> 00:11.820
who experienced the miracle
firsthand.

00:11.820 --> 00:14.330
How are we going to get the rest
of the world to believe?

00:14.330 --> 00:16.000
There'll be
another miracle, Isaiah --

00:16.000 --> 00:17.660
an even bigger one.

00:17.660 --> 00:18.910
Come on, baby.

00:18.910 --> 00:20.290
Come on, come on.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.500
Something in me died that day,
and it still hurts.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.340
It's the Al-Zuras Deck,
created by Yusuv Al-Zuras.

00:28.340 --> 00:30.430
According to legend,
he was lost at sea for 10 years.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.970
Upon returning,
he claimed he could hear

00:31.970 --> 00:33.430
the voice of God
in his head.

00:33.430 --> 00:35.640
Courtney: I've seen Zeke
try to get clean,

00:35.640 --> 00:37.520
but he always had
a backup plan.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.270
He'd stash a couple pills
in the barrel of his razor.

00:41.270 --> 00:43.480
-Get a doctor right now.
-Right away.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.150
Michaela: She was
experimenting on herself?

00:45.150 --> 00:47.230
She blames herself for the Major
getting her research,

00:47.230 --> 00:49.650
and now she feels
she has to catch up.

00:56.370 --> 00:57.950
What the hell
is happening?

01:08.010 --> 01:10.300
You'll need these.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.180
Really?

01:12.180 --> 01:13.340
And bug spray.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.680
I hear they have mosquitos

01:14.680 --> 01:17.810
the size of small cats
in Jamaica.

01:19.730 --> 01:21.270
Seriously?

01:21.270 --> 01:23.350
Mom, it's a carry-on --
I'm gonna be gone for a week.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.190
I know, but you can't
afford to eat out

01:25.190 --> 01:26.520
as much
as the other kids.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.440
I worry.
Fine.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.320
I'll take the bars.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.200
Do you know how proud
I am of you?

01:32.200 --> 01:34.410
Mom, stop.
No, no, I want to say this.

01:34.410 --> 01:38.910
I don't know what I did to
deserve such a smart, kind boy.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.330
You sure
you're gonna be okay?

01:42.330 --> 01:44.130
Like you said,
it's only a week.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.600
Olive:
Okay, so, I can't tell.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.310
Do you want to go
tomorrow night, or...?

02:05.310 --> 02:07.400
Yeah, sorry.
What's the deal?

02:07.400 --> 02:09.900
To the club.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.280
Maxine's going.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.070
And I can't really deal
with my parents right now.

02:15.070 --> 02:17.580
They are all, like,
gloomy Chicken Littles.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.120
'Cause of
that freaky Calling.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.790
There's a lot to be afraid of
right now.

02:20.790 --> 02:23.910
There's also
a lot to appreciate.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.420
Like that I got to
meet you?

02:26.420 --> 02:28.090
Exactly.

02:28.090 --> 02:31.840
Coming back was a gift, and it's
wrong not to acknowledge it.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.800
You sound
like Adrian, Church Lady.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.680
Well, he's kind of
the only person

02:37.680 --> 02:39.560
that makes sense to me
right now.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.060
What about me?

02:41.060 --> 02:43.140
Yeah.

02:43.140 --> 02:46.730
You make a little
sense, too.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.200
I'm stumped.

02:56.570 --> 03:00.580
Champagne glasses,
burnt-out plane cabin,

03:00.580 --> 03:02.660
melting walls.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.120
You will figure it out.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.540
Will I?

03:08.540 --> 03:10.840
Seems to me,
I figure out one Calling

03:10.840 --> 03:13.550
only to get another one
even more terrifying.

03:13.550 --> 03:19.260
Grace, I felt a...
hopelessness,

03:19.260 --> 03:21.970
like whatever we're meant to
save the passengers from,

03:21.970 --> 03:24.890
it's coming --

03:24.890 --> 03:27.940
and it's violent.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.270
Hey, let's have
a real Saturday.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.150
Want to go to the Whitney,
maybe walk the High Line?

03:32.150 --> 03:34.320
I can't.
I got to go to work.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.160
Hey, I can't find
my razor.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.830
Can I borrow yours?

03:43.830 --> 03:45.750
Knock yourself out.

03:48.710 --> 03:50.540
Hmm.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.380
Maybe I left it
at the gym?

03:53.550 --> 03:55.630
Well, what are these?

03:58.550 --> 04:00.430
I wanted to know
where your razor was

04:00.430 --> 04:01.760
because there were pills
in them.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.310
In my razor?
What are you talking about?

04:04.310 --> 04:05.640
Why were you looking
there?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.690
Courtney said that
you keep extras there

04:07.690 --> 04:09.140
as a safety net, so...

04:09.140 --> 04:12.150
So you found them,
and you didn't say anything?

04:12.150 --> 04:14.020
I needed to know if you were
using again, Zeke.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.480
How about
you just ask me?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.740
Addicts lie -- you were
the one that told me that.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.200
You know who else
is an addict?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.280
Courtney.

04:21.280 --> 04:25.450
You didn't think
to question the source?

04:25.450 --> 04:27.200
Michaela:
So, they're not yours?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.960
No.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.290
And it feels like crap that
you would set a trap for me,

04:31.290 --> 04:32.960
like I'm some criminal
you're trying to catch.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.920
No, I'm just trying
to help you, Zeke.

04:36.170 --> 04:37.170
What are you doing?

04:38.630 --> 04:40.970
Would you believe me
if I told you?

04:47.430 --> 04:48.980
Anyone seen
my Rangers hat?

04:48.980 --> 04:50.640
Where you going?

04:50.640 --> 04:53.400
Sam's mom is taking us to
Coney Island for his birthday.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.650
Uh...honey,
why didn't you ask us?

04:57.650 --> 05:00.150
'Cause I knew you'd say no,
and I really want to go.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.570
I know it's tough,
buddy,

05:01.570 --> 05:03.030
but we all need to be
careful right now.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.330
Here you go, squirt.
It was in my room.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.990
They're not letting me.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.910
Seriously? Wow.

05:08.910 --> 05:10.870
You're gonna hold
your own son captive

05:10.870 --> 05:12.210
just because you're scared.

05:12.210 --> 05:14.710
Olive, how about
you let us handle this?

05:14.710 --> 05:17.300
What's the point of even having
five more years to live

05:17.300 --> 05:19.800
if I can't do
anything fun, ever?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.510
Cal...

05:23.430 --> 05:25.220
Ben:

05:25.220 --> 05:27.220
Hey, hold up.
Where do you think you're going?

05:28.520 --> 05:31.350
What?
So, now I'm a prisoner, too?

05:31.350 --> 05:34.270
No, it's called grounded.
For ditching.

05:34.270 --> 05:36.190
The school called
again.

05:36.190 --> 05:38.440
Did you think there
weren't gonna be
any consequences?

05:38.440 --> 05:40.950
Returning to Adrian's cult
when I explicitly told --

05:40.950 --> 05:43.240
Would you stop
calling it that?!

05:43.240 --> 05:44.870
I was helping
at the soup kitchen.

05:44.870 --> 05:47.740
Regardless, there is no excuse
for skipping school.

05:47.740 --> 05:48.790
I'm done with school.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.250
I'm taking the GED,

05:50.250 --> 05:51.540
and I am helping run
the church's outreach.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.290
What?
Absolutely not.

05:53.290 --> 05:55.790
I'm old enough
to get emancipated.

05:55.790 --> 05:59.550
And I am so sick of you trying
to control what I believe.

05:59.550 --> 06:02.760
I'm sorry, what planet do you
think you're living on?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.970
This is not
some broken home.

06:04.970 --> 06:06.720
That's exactly
what this is!

06:06.720 --> 06:09.140
We are completely
and utterly broken.

06:09.140 --> 06:11.020
What do you think,
Adrian's gonna somehow save you?

06:11.020 --> 06:12.770
He's the very reason
we live in fear.

06:12.770 --> 06:14.850
Don't put your paranoia
on him.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.310
Paranoia?

06:16.310 --> 06:17.480
Olive, our last Calling,

06:17.480 --> 06:18.860
there were dead bodies
on the plane.

06:18.860 --> 06:20.280
I am trying
to stop that!

06:20.280 --> 06:21.990
What's Adrian doing
to help the passengers?!

06:21.990 --> 06:23.610
Bringing hope to people!

06:23.610 --> 06:25.660
Helping them see
that death may not be final,

06:25.660 --> 06:27.370
that your return
is a miracle.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.370
Listen to yourself.
It's insane.

06:29.370 --> 06:31.450
So, I can't believe
in the miracle?

06:31.450 --> 06:33.040
I live with two of them.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.710
Okay, Olive...

06:34.710 --> 06:36.790
Olive!

06:36.790 --> 06:38.880
Adrian has to be
stopped.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.640
Hour 23 since third injection.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.350
First two were a bust,
but, uh...

06:55.350 --> 06:59.110
you got to
keep trying, right?

07:01.280 --> 07:03.990
DNA still has a mutation.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.860
That's another fail.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.950
Third trial complete.

07:07.950 --> 07:10.240
We missed you
at Friday supper.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.540
We worry about you,
your mom and I.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.840
I'm fine, Dad.

07:19.840 --> 07:24.210
Just please tell Mom
I lost track of time.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.760
Tell me what's wrong,
love.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.470
I mean, only that
I can't figure this out

07:29.470 --> 07:31.140
and lives
are depending on me.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.930
Hmm.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.770
I seem to remember you
being in the same pickle

07:34.770 --> 07:36.640
with your cancer work.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.350
And what did you do then?

07:39.350 --> 07:43.480
Talk to your immunologist friend
at Boroughs Regional.

07:43.480 --> 07:47.240
You said she helped you
think about it in new ways.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.030
Yeah, I haven't talked to her
since I've been back.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.490
There's some baggage there.

07:50.490 --> 07:51.910
Sorry, my bad.

07:51.910 --> 07:54.330
I thought you said
lives depended on it.

07:58.790 --> 08:00.670
So, you're going to sue me

08:00.670 --> 08:02.170
if your daughter runs
my mission group?

08:02.170 --> 08:04.550
It's called endangering a minor.
You brainwashed her.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.840
Maybe I should sue you
for assault.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.050
She's ready to file
for emancipation.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.840
I assume she got that idea
from you.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.470
She sees the truth
in my words.

08:12.470 --> 08:13.970
I can't be blamed
for your fear.

08:13.970 --> 08:16.890
This is more than fear!
You're breeding zealots!

08:16.890 --> 08:19.390
You're preaching
that passengers can't die!

08:19.390 --> 08:20.690
You're bending my words.

08:20.690 --> 08:22.150
Just being part
of your cult

08:22.150 --> 08:23.820
puts Olive
and all of your followers

08:23.820 --> 08:25.400
in the cross hairs
of 828 haters.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.280
I have that updated
parishioner list

08:27.280 --> 08:29.360
pulled up on your screen,
if you want to see.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.280
Give me a minute.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.580
Listen to me.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.080
Some of us had a Calling.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.160
It was telling us
to save the passengers.

08:39.160 --> 08:41.790
The plane
was covered in ash.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.050
Have you been tested
for post-traumatic stress?

08:46.050 --> 08:48.420
Oh, come on, Adrian, don't act
like you've never had a Calling.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.010
You showed up
when the plane exploded!

08:51.010 --> 08:53.100
Ben, we're all being guided.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.470
You're choosing
to live in fear.

08:55.470 --> 08:57.770
I choose to live
in the miracle.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.890
I couldn't care less
where you choose to live.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.610
Ignoring Callings
is reckless.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.730
Now, maybe I'm wrong,
but what if I'm right

09:05.730 --> 09:08.150
and what we saw turns out to be
another Xer attack

09:08.150 --> 09:11.910
on your church,
or worse?

09:11.910 --> 09:14.830
If my daughter gets hurt...

09:14.830 --> 09:16.910
that's on you.

09:38.310 --> 09:41.230
Did you lose something
in there?

09:43.310 --> 09:44.810
Take mine.

09:47.270 --> 09:48.570
How about we share?

09:49.860 --> 09:51.950
You think I'm trying
to poison you?

09:53.820 --> 09:55.910
Think of it
as an olive branch.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.750
Uh-oh. You have that look
on your face.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.670
What's up?

10:07.380 --> 10:10.300
Had a pretty bleak Calling.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.010
Felt like a warning
about the Xers.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.010
Well, I'm happy to help.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.430
Hey, Stone!

10:20.430 --> 10:22.020
Guy just called.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.810
He said he had information
on that church attack.

10:23.810 --> 10:24.850
Didn't leave a name.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.150
Thank you.

10:29.110 --> 10:32.030
Hey, stop hounding me.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.450
I got this.

10:33.450 --> 10:37.280
Hey, chill,
I'm just looking for an ETA.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.990
Look, I'll get you all
the information you need today.

10:39.990 --> 10:42.540
Good, 'cause it's
all coming together on our end.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.660
Medieval Latin Literature?

11:18.660 --> 11:22.410
Theory of Ordinary
Differential Equations?

11:22.410 --> 11:24.330
Oh, wow.
Your classes are wack.

11:24.330 --> 11:25.710
Did you ask
to see my schedule

11:25.710 --> 11:27.080
just so you can
make fun of me, or...?

11:27.080 --> 11:28.580
No, no, no --

11:28.580 --> 11:32.550
to see if you'd have any time
for me next semester.

11:32.550 --> 11:34.010
That, I do.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.050
No way. They found it --

11:39.050 --> 11:41.100
Al-Zuras' journal.
Really?

11:41.100 --> 11:43.180
The guy who painted
my mom's tarot cards --

11:43.180 --> 11:44.810
he wrote a journal?
Yeah, apparently.

11:44.810 --> 11:46.390
I was doing
this deep dive on him,

11:46.390 --> 11:47.640
and this title popped up

11:47.640 --> 11:49.560
from some collection
over at Yale.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.020
Figured we'd get
some answers.

11:51.020 --> 11:52.400
About the Death Date.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.150
Faculty lend only.

11:54.150 --> 11:56.320
I'm getting it sent
to your dad.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.700
You know, Adrian isn't afraid
of the Death Date.

12:02.700 --> 12:06.200
He says you guys are proof
that miracles exist.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.830
Yeah, I've heard
his theory on how we can't die.

12:10.170 --> 12:13.380
Well...
you did come back once.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.460
Honestly, Olive,
I'm with your dad.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.380
I think
Adrian's full of it.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.680
So, you don't believe
in the miracle?

12:20.680 --> 12:23.180
I'm not an angel or some god.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.100
I came back the same exact
person who left,

12:25.100 --> 12:27.350
except I didn't have
a mom anymore.

12:27.350 --> 12:30.730
Or friends or a home,
for that matter.

12:32.980 --> 12:36.690
Tell me --
how is that a miracle?

12:36.690 --> 12:38.570
Hi, there. Detective Stone,
returning your call.

12:38.570 --> 12:41.490
Man: Hello.
Thanks for calling me back.

12:41.490 --> 12:42.950
Isaiah?

12:42.950 --> 12:44.620
I remembered a few things
about my attack

12:44.620 --> 12:46.080
I think might be helpful.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.750
Well, I'm here.
Come on in.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.750
That's the thing.
I-I got called in to work.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.670
Any way you can come
to me?

12:51.670 --> 12:53.210
Where are you at?

12:53.210 --> 12:56.550
I'll be at Schimanski
in Williamsburg.

12:56.550 --> 12:59.130
Alright, see you then.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.290
Man over P.A.:
Blue Team to ICU, please.

13:32.290 --> 13:33.790
Blue Team, ICU.

13:33.790 --> 13:35.540
Dr. Bates.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.550
Thanks for coming.

13:39.550 --> 13:42.050
Of course.

13:42.050 --> 13:43.970
My pleasure.

13:43.970 --> 13:46.050
Been hoping
you'd reach out.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.430
Yeah, no, I wouldn't
have bothered you.

13:47.430 --> 13:49.680
I just --
I've hit a wall.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.390
Can we talk about it
in my office, Doctor?

13:51.390 --> 13:54.060
"Doctor"? Really?

13:54.060 --> 13:55.730
Alex.

13:57.190 --> 13:59.070
So, the patient's
corrected DNA

13:59.070 --> 14:01.360
in the retrovirus solution
hasn't....

14:01.360 --> 14:03.280
What?

14:07.240 --> 14:10.620
It's just...
My God -- five years.

14:13.670 --> 14:17.000
Can we please...

14:17.000 --> 14:19.300
Can we just talk about us
for a minute?

14:19.300 --> 14:21.630
No, Alex, really,
this is about the work.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.260
Can I at least say
I'm sorry?

14:23.260 --> 14:25.090
The time for "I'm sorry"
was when I came back.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.760
It's been months.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.560
You don't know how many times
I picked up the phone.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.020
Like that counts
for anything.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.890
Look, if I knew anyone else
who could help me,

14:32.890 --> 14:34.980
you wouldn't be here.

14:34.980 --> 14:38.060
I was on my way...

14:38.060 --> 14:41.490
and then I just became...
terrified.

14:41.490 --> 14:43.240
That Scott would find out?

14:43.240 --> 14:47.870
That I was destroying my family
for a fling in Jamaica.

14:47.870 --> 14:49.620
A fling?

14:49.620 --> 14:51.200
Is that what it was
to you?

14:51.200 --> 14:55.370
You just said it --
it's all about the work for you.

14:55.370 --> 15:00.210
That's not true.
That is...not true!

15:00.210 --> 15:02.920
I loved you.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.050
Vi, I'll always love you.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.860
Okay.

15:20.860 --> 15:23.110
Start with
the retroviral serum.

15:23.110 --> 15:26.910
Take me through the process
step-by-step, working backwards.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.740
I'm gonna need all the research
you have on the Xers

15:31.740 --> 15:33.410
before I interview Isaiah.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.290
Well, if he wouldn't talk after
the church attack, why now?

15:36.290 --> 15:38.790
I don't know.
Maybe he had a change of heart.

15:38.790 --> 15:41.630
Oh, could you have that church
shut down, please?

15:41.630 --> 15:44.340
Olive's threatening
to join it full-time.

15:44.340 --> 15:47.090
Mick, she wants
to drop out of school.

15:47.090 --> 15:49.180
I threatened
to drop out once.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.640
Yeah, remember?

15:50.640 --> 15:52.720
I was gonna roadie
for Skee Miller's punk band.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.560
Oh, yeah.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.060
What did Dad do?

15:56.060 --> 15:57.520
Uh, he got drunk with him.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.100
Yeah, hand to God.
I came home,

15:59.100 --> 16:02.020
and my tatted-up boyfriend
was shotgunning beers...

16:02.020 --> 16:03.900
with my dad.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.280
Kind of lost interest in him
after that one.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.110
So you're saying,
if I have a beer with Adrian,

16:08.110 --> 16:09.700
it'll fix this?

16:09.700 --> 16:12.990
There's no harm in keeping
your enemies close.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.960
So, how are things going
with Zeke

16:16.960 --> 16:18.580
now that Courtney's gone?

16:18.580 --> 16:20.130
Ha. I'm starting to think

16:20.130 --> 16:21.840
I might gravitate
towards the wrong guys.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.130
Come on.

16:23.130 --> 16:25.010
Zeke's a good guy.
So is Jared.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.460
Whose side are you on?

16:26.460 --> 16:27.720
Yours, always.

16:29.340 --> 16:32.220
But I have noticed
a pattern.

16:32.220 --> 16:34.430
Come on. You get to a point,
and you pull away.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.430
Am I wrong?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.940
Thank you.
Thank you for the files.

17:54.970 --> 17:58.310
We are never gonna
be getting in this way.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.390
Well, we could do
something else.

18:00.390 --> 18:02.440
Okay, so, do you not
want to go in?

18:02.440 --> 18:06.230
No, I-I said I did.

18:06.230 --> 18:08.360
Well, you also said

18:08.360 --> 18:11.570
you wanted to go
to the church, so...

18:11.570 --> 18:14.280
You're right.
I'm sorry.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.910
I just didn't want
to blow it with you.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.620
Did I blow it?

18:20.620 --> 18:22.960
No.

Olive!

18:57.120 --> 18:58.370
You always this busy?

18:58.370 --> 18:59.700
Oh.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.330
We're doing
a free champagne night.

19:01.330 --> 19:03.000
It's my job

19:03.000 --> 19:05.460
Gotcha.

19:05.460 --> 19:07.460
Is there anywhere

19:07.460 --> 19:09.590
Look, I know you didn't want
to come forward,

19:09.590 --> 19:12.300
but I promise you,
we'll keep this under wraps.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.590
This is your chance to help the
passengers you revere so much.

19:15.590 --> 19:17.760
I want that
more than you know.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.600
But I'm the only manager
tonight,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.770
and we're running low
on stock.

19:21.770 --> 19:24.850
How about a glass while
I run back and get some more?

19:24.850 --> 19:26.520
I'm on duty.

19:26.520 --> 19:27.980
Of course.

It all felt pointless.

20:06.640 --> 20:11.860
But meeting your dad
and -- and then you, I...

20:11.860 --> 20:14.610
I'm happy for the first time
since then.

20:14.610 --> 20:19.660
I feel like I finally have
something to live for.

20:19.660 --> 20:23.410
So I wanted to say
I do believe.

20:23.410 --> 20:25.870
Just not in the way
Adrian said.

20:27.910 --> 20:31.750
I want you to have this.

20:31.750 --> 20:34.800
What?

20:34.800 --> 20:38.760
TJ, wow,
this is beautiful.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.680
I thought I lost
everything of my mom's,

20:40.680 --> 20:43.390
but a neighbor
held onto it.

20:43.390 --> 20:46.310
She called it
her Buddha bracelet.

20:46.310 --> 20:49.640
This one
was her favorite --

20:49.640 --> 20:51.730
the dharma wheel.

20:51.730 --> 20:55.690
It symbolizes
life is circular,

20:55.690 --> 20:58.320
that there's no beginning

I came for that drink.

21:32.690 --> 21:35.900
With me?
I said all I need to say to you.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.110
You texted me
to meet you here.

21:38.110 --> 21:39.440
Couldn't scare me
with the lawsuit,

21:39.440 --> 21:40.900
so now you're trying
to gaslight me?

21:40.900 --> 21:43.740
Well, I'm done.
Hold on, hold on.

21:43.740 --> 21:46.450

you tell me what's going on.

21:46.450 --> 21:48.330

21:48.330 --> 21:50.410
I didn't text you.

I didn't even know I'd be here
till an hour ago.

22:16.610 --> 22:18.400
Can I help you?
Hope so.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.360
I've been getting
these weird error messages

22:20.360 --> 22:22.650
every time I try to pull up
a batch of case logs.

22:22.650 --> 22:24.700
I don't know, maybe
one of the files is corrupted.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.370
42-38 Detroit, with --

22:33.460 --> 22:36.170
Uh, part of the problem
may be access.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.670
I'm seeing here, these are
Detective Stone's cases.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.760
Without her approval,
you can't open them.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.300
Look. Detective Stone --

22:42.300 --> 22:43.680
she's up for a promotion.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.090
I'm just trying
to put together some ammo

22:45.090 --> 22:46.510
to try to help her
win our case.

22:46.510 --> 22:48.390
The ones you were on,
I can get.

22:48.390 --> 22:52.140
The rest -- that'd be
a "no can do."

22:52.140 --> 22:54.600
Hmm.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.270
Well,
last time I checked,

22:56.270 --> 22:58.770
online betting is
a "no can do," too.

22:58.770 --> 23:02.740
And if you've been erasing your
history to cover it up...

23:02.740 --> 23:05.070
that's a fireable offense.

23:07.570 --> 23:10.280
Round 4 of retrovirus trial.

23:10.280 --> 23:15.500
I tweaked the formula after
talking it through with Alex.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.040
And for the record,
I'm not feeling very hopeful.

24:51.510 --> 24:53.010
Did you try her cell?
Yeah!

24:54.260 --> 24:55.390
Thank God you're here.
Any luck?

24:55.390 --> 24:56.640
Keeps going to voicemail.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.350
Same with Ben and Olive?
Yes.

24:58.350 --> 25:01.100
Olive is out with her friend TJ,
but she didn't say where.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.480
Wait!
They're always texting.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.940
But how can we access
all those texts?

25:04.940 --> 25:07.990
Her iPad -- she lets me
play Minecraft on it.

25:07.990 --> 25:09.900
Text me the address.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.450
Adrian!

25:13.450 --> 25:15.950
Why the hell did you bring
these passengers here?

25:15.950 --> 25:17.500
I didn't.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.160
I don't -- I don't even know
what you're talking about.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.000
Look around you!

25:23.880 --> 25:26.000
Ben, what are you
doing here?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.460
What the hell is with
all these passengers?

25:27.460 --> 25:28.760
I'm trying to
figure that out, too.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.420
I contacted Adrian,
like you said.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.090
He texted me
to meet him here.

25:32.090 --> 25:33.550
Only it wasn't me!

25:33.550 --> 25:35.140
Isaiah, my assistant,
works here.

25:35.140 --> 25:38.310
Said he needed to fill the place
for some promotion.

25:38.310 --> 25:41.850
I thought I misplaced my phone,
but he must have taken it.

25:43.310 --> 25:45.690
It's a trap.
He lured us here!

25:45.690 --> 25:47.780
But why?
Ben?

26:12.220 --> 26:13.680
You were in that Calling.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.430
You lied to me!
You knew!

26:15.430 --> 26:17.760
I just -- I didn't want to
believe it could happen!

26:17.760 --> 26:19.220
This is what the Calling
was warning us about --

26:19.220 --> 26:20.430
"save the passengers."

26:21.520 --> 26:23.600
You didn't want
to believe?

26:23.600 --> 26:25.730
You hypocritical
son of a bitch!

26:29.690 --> 26:32.360
Woman: Did you see that?

26:32.360 --> 26:33.950
Oh, no, no,
don't drink the champagne!

26:33.950 --> 26:35.360
Is he okay?

26:37.240 --> 26:39.040
I don't have a signal!

26:42.710 --> 26:45.880
You can fix this.
Find Isaiah! Now!

26:45.880 --> 26:47.340
Man: Hey, man.
You okay?

26:47.340 --> 26:50.050
Wait, Ben!
Ben, Ben!

27:18.620 --> 27:20.490
Hi. This is Ben Stone.

27:20.490 --> 27:21.740
I can't answer the phone
right now,

27:21.740 --> 27:23.410
but please leave me a message.

27:41.310 --> 27:43.810
There's no signal anywhere.
He must've shut it off somehow.

27:43.810 --> 27:45.690
We got to get help.

27:46.770 --> 27:47.770
No, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

27:47.770 --> 27:49.440
Ben! Ben, Ben!

27:49.440 --> 27:51.940
What I was trying to say is,
I saw Olive.

27:51.940 --> 27:53.610
She's here.

27:53.610 --> 27:54.900
Olive!

27:56.110 --> 27:57.990
Olive!

27:57.990 --> 27:59.870
Ben.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.390
Woman:
Hey, honey.

28:30.980 --> 28:33.400
Aren't you glad we came?
Very.

28:36.190 --> 28:39.320
Well...
We're celebrating.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.620
Max said it's free tonight,
so...

28:41.620 --> 28:43.120
I'll see if I can
get us a bottle.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.000
Yes!

28:59.260 --> 29:01.550
-Help!
-Open the door!

29:02.640 --> 29:04.100
Man: Open the door!

29:04.100 --> 29:05.720
Ben: Olive!
Ben! Ben!

29:05.720 --> 29:07.140
Oh!
I can't find her.
I can't find Olive.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.520
I can't lose her again.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.190
You're not going to, okay?
Go look for her.

29:10.190 --> 29:12.060
I'll find a way out.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.030
Everyone, this way!
Out this door!

29:25.030 --> 29:27.500
Come on, come on!
Quick!

29:36.340 --> 29:38.170
That's weird.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.890
Do you hear something?

29:45.350 --> 29:48.470
It sounds like
people are screaming.

29:50.430 --> 29:53.150
Max, something's wrong.
The door, it's locked.
No, no, no, no.

29:53.150 --> 29:54.980
-Hello?!
-Hey!

29:54.980 --> 29:57.690
Olive: Hello? Let us out!
People are in here!

30:12.500 --> 30:15.880
Everyone out of the way!
Move, move!

30:17.590 --> 30:18.670
Ben: Olive!

30:27.970 --> 30:29.720
Help, please!
Please!

30:29.720 --> 30:31.890
Olive!
TJ, I can't open
the door.

30:31.890 --> 30:33.690
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.770
-TJ!
-Ben?

30:37.770 --> 30:41.320
-Dad!
-Olive!

30:47.240 --> 30:48.620
Dad, what are you
doing here?

30:48.620 --> 30:50.540
I'm here to save you.

30:52.750 --> 30:56.290
Everyone out this way!
Careful, careful!

30:58.920 --> 31:00.300
Man: Where is she?!

31:08.800 --> 31:10.470
Oh, my God, smoke!

31:10.470 --> 31:12.180
Stay here.

31:17.810 --> 31:19.690
No, no, no!
This way, this way!

31:19.690 --> 31:21.610
Olive: Dad!

31:21.610 --> 31:22.740
Dad!
Olive!

31:22.740 --> 31:24.110
My ankle!

31:32.120 --> 31:33.370
Bethany!

31:33.370 --> 31:34.620
Bethany:
I can't move!

31:34.620 --> 31:36.790
-Hold on. I got you!
-Oh! Ow!

31:38.580 --> 31:39.790
Ow!

31:39.790 --> 31:41.670
Help!
Someone help me!

31:41.670 --> 31:44.170
-Michaela! Michaela!
-Zeke?!

31:44.170 --> 31:45.550
No, no, no!
It's too hot!

31:50.550 --> 31:52.640
Quick! Go!

31:52.640 --> 31:55.060
I got you!

31:55.060 --> 31:57.140
Drop it!

32:11.910 --> 32:14.620
We got to turn around.

32:17.790 --> 32:20.670
No, this is our only way.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.960
Let's clear a path.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.730
Wait. Hold on.

32:36.730 --> 32:38.600
There was supposed to be
a door here.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.110
It was right here.

32:41.110 --> 32:42.400
This way.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.530
-Jared. Wha--
-Follow me. Come on.

32:51.410 --> 32:52.870
Dad!

32:52.870 --> 32:54.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

32:54.490 --> 32:56.620
You can't leave.
The miracle is upon us,

32:56.620 --> 32:59.330
but only if passengers are
among the fallen.

32:59.330 --> 33:01.500
Let her go.
She's not a passenger.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.000
Please, Isaiah, we still have
time to get out of here.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.460
No, we'll be okay.
We believe.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.340
We'll step into the light
together.

33:08.340 --> 33:12.260
Isaiah, let her go,
or we'll all be dead.

33:12.260 --> 33:14.560
No!
We will all be miracles

33:14.560 --> 33:16.850
and transcend death
just like you did.

33:20.850 --> 33:22.350
Get her out! Go!

33:22.350 --> 33:24.060
No!
TJ, I'm not leaving you!

33:24.060 --> 33:25.440
Ben! Go, now!

33:25.440 --> 33:28.780
-No!
-I'm coming back!

33:57.470 --> 34:00.180
Zeke! Your hands.
Wh--

34:00.180 --> 34:01.810
You okay?

34:01.810 --> 34:03.520
It's not so bad.

34:03.520 --> 34:07.110
-I'm going back in!
-Ben and Olive are still inside.

34:07.110 --> 34:09.610
Ben! Olive!

34:11.360 --> 34:13.450
-TJ's still inside with Isaiah.
-No! Stop!

34:13.450 --> 34:15.120
It is way too dangerous.
-No! Ben, listen to her!

34:15.120 --> 34:17.620
No, Dad, please go
and save him!

34:17.620 --> 34:19.290
-Ben, Ben!
-No, hey! Ben!

34:25.210 --> 34:28.630
Oh, God!

34:35.800 --> 34:38.720
Oh, no, no.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.610
No, no, no!

36:07.480 --> 36:11.230
I -- I think I did it.

36:11.230 --> 36:14.570
DNA has no anomaly.

36:14.570 --> 36:17.070
Hey, sorry for
the messages, but...

36:17.070 --> 36:20.620
Ben, I think I have some news.
I got rid of the Callings.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.120
We can live normal lives,
no preord--

36:22.120 --> 36:24.080
Watch it!

36:24.080 --> 36:25.790
Woman over P.A.:
Mass-casualty incident.
Incoming wounded.

36:25.790 --> 36:27.580
All trauma and emergency
personnel, report to E.R.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.120
Wait. Incident where?
Where, where, where?!

36:29.120 --> 36:30.830
Mass casualty incident.
Incoming wounded.

36:30.830 --> 36:32.710
Hey, hey,
what happened?

36:32.710 --> 36:34.800
This was it -- this is what
we were trying to stop.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.920
Oh, my God.
You were there? How?

36:36.920 --> 36:38.630
We had a Calling.
Wait...

36:38.630 --> 36:40.720
You didn't?

36:40.720 --> 36:41.970
TJ didn't make it.

36:41.970 --> 36:43.640
Woman:
NYPD! A little help?

36:43.640 --> 36:45.560
I've got to go.

36:52.980 --> 36:55.110
There you are.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.280
I appreciate
what you did in there.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.160
We're cops, Mick.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.080
That's what we do.

37:08.710 --> 37:09.920
Hey.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.500
I'm glad you're okay.

37:19.970 --> 37:23.300
It's hard to believe that this
is all the work of a Believer.

37:23.300 --> 37:26.850
One lunatic
is all it takes.

37:26.850 --> 37:29.980
Yeah, well, it makes me sick
that I wasn't there to help.

37:29.980 --> 37:33.560
You're helping me now.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.780
Wait, something's odd.
These aren't burns.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.440
What do you mean?

37:38.440 --> 37:42.200
This looks like
frostbite.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.030
Like from the cold?

37:44.030 --> 37:46.490
Like what I had
when I woke up in the cave?

37:49.040 --> 37:52.580
Griffin drowned on dry land.
Is that what's happening to me?

37:52.580 --> 37:55.290
I'm freezing to death?

37:55.290 --> 37:57.380
I don't know.
You might be.

38:10.930 --> 38:13.270
Well, I got Cal to bed.

38:17.190 --> 38:19.070
I don't understand.

38:19.070 --> 38:20.740
None of us do.

38:20.740 --> 38:25.200
We couldn't see this coming.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.280
Not me. Not anyone.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.200
He was so happy
working with you, Dad.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.330
Just today,
he found a journal.

38:33.330 --> 38:36.080
He thinks it's about
the Death Date.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.170
He had the library send it
to your office, Dad.

38:38.170 --> 38:39.500
You have to go get it.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.630
I will, I promise.

38:44.090 --> 38:46.640
Oh, my God.

39:00.070 --> 39:03.150
Was gonna leave your case files
on your desk.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.610
When your partner told me
to print them,

39:04.610 --> 39:05.990
I didn't realize
I'd run out of paper.

39:05.990 --> 39:08.280
Got the last six pages
there.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.910
Drea wanted you
to print these?

39:09.910 --> 39:11.290
No, it was Vasquez.

39:11.290 --> 39:13.870
He said he needed them
for your promotion.

39:16.290 --> 39:18.590
Right, yeah.
Thank you.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.460
Pass these right along.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.100
Saanvi: Alex?

39:29.100 --> 39:33.270
I just came to tell you that
the modification was successful.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.810
Glad you got
what you wanted.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.360
Thanks to you.

40:12.350 --> 40:15.680
This was crazy of you.
Why did you do this?

40:15.680 --> 40:18.400
It's not the craziest thing
that's happened since I met you.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.270
We keep getting stuff
thrown at us,

40:22.270 --> 40:24.190
yet here we are.

40:26.450 --> 40:29.410
So, what's it gonna take,
Mick?

40:29.410 --> 40:31.200
What do you mean?

40:36.460 --> 40:40.830
I mean, I love you.

40:40.830 --> 40:42.710
I'm all in.

40:42.710 --> 40:44.630
I don't know
if you have room for me,

40:44.630 --> 40:46.550
but I love you.

40:49.840 --> 40:53.180
Crap.
What?

40:53.180 --> 40:55.270
I love you, too.
