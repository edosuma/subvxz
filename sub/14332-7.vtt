18:07.453 --> 18:10.422
THAT WOULD PREVENT
ALL THIS MAYHEM FROM HAPPENING.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.759
- AND SINCE I DROVE HIM
INTO THE WOODS, IT IS MY FAULT.

18:13.826 --> 18:14.960
- [screams]

18:15.027 --> 18:17.296
TIMMY, TIMMY, TIMMY.

18:17.362 --> 18:19.631
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I MESSED UP.

18:19.698 --> 18:22.234
- NO, I ALWAYS SAY
"TIMMY, TIMMY, TIMMY"

18:22.301 --> 18:24.636
BEFORE I BLACK OUT
FROM A FOX ATTACK.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.271
[whimpers]

18:26.338 --> 18:29.208
[horn honking]
[bear growling]

18:31.376 --> 18:33.779
- OH, NO!
THE CITY IS FALLING APART.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.482
WE GOTTA FIND CHET
AND GET HIM BACK ON THE NEWS!

18:36.548 --> 18:38.851
- WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT,
LITTLE MISSY.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.553
- WOW. THANKS FOR THE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE, COSMO.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.656
- NO, I ALWAYS SAY "GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT, LITTLE MISSY"

18:44.723 --> 18:46.258
WHEN I REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS

18:46.325 --> 18:49.228
BEFORE BLACKING OUT
A SECOND TIME FROM A FOX ATTACK.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.963
[whimpers]

18:52.097 --> 18:54.533
[Sparky sniffing]

18:54.600 --> 18:56.835
- GOOD JOB TRACKING CHET DOWN,
SPARKY.

18:56.902 --> 18:58.270
HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS IN THIS CABIN?

18:58.337 --> 19:00.806
DID YOU USE YOUR CANINE SENSES
TO TRACK DOWN HIS SCENT?

19:00.873 --> 19:02.374
- NO, I JUST FOLLOWED

19:02.441 --> 19:03.842
THESE WOMAN'S
SIZE-FOUR FOOTPRINTS...

19:03.909 --> 19:06.178
AND HIS TRAIL OF TEARS.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.815
- MR. UBETCHA,
ARE YOU IN THERE?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.251
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING,
NO ONE LIVES HERE!

19:12.317 --> 19:13.652
GO AWAY!

19:13.719 --> 19:16.255
- CHET, PLEASE,
YOU GOTTA GO BACK TO WORK!

19:16.321 --> 19:18.457
DIMMSDALE NEEDS
YOUR WATCHDOG REPORTING

19:18.524 --> 19:21.326
BEFORE THE CITY
FALLS APART!

19:21.393 --> 19:23.161
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING,

19:23.228 --> 19:25.197
I'VE MOVED ON
TO A FULFILLING NEW LIFE

19:25.264 --> 19:28.333
AS A SAD, CRAZY LOSER
IN THE WOODS.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.703
[sobbing]
I'M SO UNHAPPY!

19:31.770 --> 19:33.839
- MR. UBETCHA,
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.774
ALL THE THINGS YOU REPORTED ON
WERE REAL.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.643
MY FRIENDS AND I
SAW THEM TOO.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.144
WE EVEN HAVE PICTURES.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.079
RIGHT, NON-MAGICAL,
HUMAN FRIENDS?

19:41.146 --> 19:43.448
- RIGHT.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.555
- LOOK AT THAT.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.256
IT'S THE DINOSAUR
PLAYING THE ACCORDION,

19:51.323 --> 19:52.658
THE JELLY BEAN VOLCANO,

19:52.724 --> 19:54.626
AND THE BEAVER BOY
CHASING THE ALIEN SPACESHIP.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.261
SO I'M NOT CRAZY!

19:56.328 --> 19:57.729
- RIGHT.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.232
'CAUSE WEARING A TV
ON YOUR HEAD IS TOTALLY NORMAL.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.334
- SAYS MY HUSBAND
IN THE HOOP SKIRT

20:02.401 --> 20:04.303
WITH THE MEAT-FILLED CHA-CHAS.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.606
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, CHET?
LET'S GO REPORT THE NEWS.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.742
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING,
I'M BACK AT 6:00 AND 11:00!

20:10.809 --> 20:13.345
SPORTS AND WEATHER
ON THE 10:00s.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.748
OOPS! I FORGOT
THAT TIMMY'S DAD HAS MY CLOTHES.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.317
THIS JUST IN--

20:18.383 --> 20:20.886
COVER YOUR EYES UNTIL I PUT ON
MY POODLE SKIRT AND BOBBY SOCKS.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.921
THIS IS CHET UBETCHA REPORTING

20:22.988 --> 20:24.323
THAT BUILDINGS
HAVE BEEN CRUMBLING

20:24.389 --> 20:26.224
BECAUSE CONTRACTORS
HAVE BEEN CUTTING COSTS

20:26.291 --> 20:30.128
BY REPLACING STEEL GIRDERS
WITH FUDGY BAR STICKS.

20:30.195 --> 20:33.732
- OH! THESE FUDGY BARS
MIGHT NOT HOLD UP BUILDINGS,

20:33.799 --> 20:36.568
BUT THEY SURE TASTE GOOD!

20:36.635 --> 20:38.136
[sirens blare]

20:43.408 --> 20:44.610
- HI, TIMMY!

20:44.676 --> 20:47.312
I'M LICKING FUDGE
OFF A GIRDER.

20:47.379 --> 20:50.115
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA REPORTING
THAT THE OUTSKIRT STEAK HOUSE

20:50.182 --> 20:51.984
HAS SECRETLY REPLACED
THEIR STEAK

20:52.050 --> 20:54.953
WITH LESS EXPENSIVE TURKEY,
CAUSING DINERS TO FALL ASLEEP.

20:56.388 --> 20:57.623
- AAH!

20:57.689 --> 21:00.192
- HI, TIMMY!
I JUST ATE A BIG STEAK DINNER.

21:00.258 --> 21:01.460
[snores]

21:01.526 --> 21:02.961
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING,

21:03.028 --> 21:04.329
MONKEYS HAVE BEEN HELPING
DANGEROUS ANIMALS

21:04.396 --> 21:05.831
ESCAPE FROM THE ZOO.

21:05.897 --> 21:08.066
IT APPEARS THEY'VE BEEN
SECRETLY TAKING ONLINE CLASSES

21:08.133 --> 21:10.636
TO LEARN HOW TO PICK LOCKS
AND PICK POCKETS.

21:10.702 --> 21:12.771
- WOW, THESE SHOES
ARE REALLY POINTY!

21:15.807 --> 21:17.542
[monkey screeches]
HI, TIMMY!

21:17.609 --> 21:19.845
TELL YOUR MOM TO CANCEL
MY CREDIT CARDS.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.214
- NICE JOB, MR. UBETCHA.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.949
IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.283
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING,

21:25.350 --> 21:29.221
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK

21:29.287 --> 21:31.490
- I WOULD LIKE
TO PRESENT CHET UBETCHA

21:31.556 --> 21:32.991
WITH THE NEWSMAN
OF THE YEAR AWARD

21:33.058 --> 21:36.361
FOR HIS WATCHDOG REPORTING
THAT SAVED DIMMSDALE.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.630
- THANK YOU, MAYOR,
BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

21:38.697 --> 21:40.999
WITHOUT THE HELP OF A BOY
NAMED TIMMY TURNER.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.701

- YES! I'LL ADD IT
TO MY COLLECTION OF AWARDS.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.215
AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST ONE
WITHOUT DINKELBERG'S NAME ON IT.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.651
I GOT A MONKEY
TO STEAL THESE FOR ME.

21:59.718 --> 22:00.886
LOOK, TIMMY!

22:00.952 --> 22:02.654
YOU CAN TELL
THIS AWARD IS PRESTIGIOUS

22:02.721 --> 22:05.190
'CAUSE IT'S SHAPED
LIKE A DONKEY'S BEHIND!

22:05.257 --> 22:07.325
[screams]

22:07.392 --> 22:09.561
WHOOPS!
