01:08.800 --> 01:10.923
I'm looking for Darby Reese.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.204
Does he know you're coming?

01:14.920 --> 01:16.690
No, he doesn't.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.530
Darby.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.048
Someone's mom's here to see you.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.804
Yeah, all right.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.442
All right, yeah.
Who'd you say you are?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.805
Margaret Hall.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.889
He'll be right down.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.610
How 'bout this?

02:22.400 --> 02:25.319
- Mother of Beau.
- Mr. Reese?

02:25.320 --> 02:28.159
You're younger than
I expected. Please, sit.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.362
I want you to stay
away from my son.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.242
Does Beau know you're here?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.279
- Dyl, where are your sneakers?
- Don't know.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.759
Please find them, sweetheart.
You'll catch a cold.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.928
Oh, Jack! I'm sorry.

04:55.680 --> 04:59.009
Margaret, where on earth
is that damned remote?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.879
I... I... I don't know. Um...

05:01.880 --> 05:04.879
Oh, broken, isn't it? Didn't
Dylan step on it last night?

05:04.880 --> 05:06.799
Oh, for the love of Pete.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.559
Try the one in the study.
I think it'll work.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.279
And where is Mr. Dylan?

05:11.280 --> 05:13.079
He's in the driveway.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.647
Dylan!

05:25.720 --> 05:27.279
Sweetheart, do you know
where your brother is?

05:27.280 --> 05:28.399
Um, in the driveway.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.489
- I mean Beau.
- Oh.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.800
He took off in the boat. Mad
about something. I don't know.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.448
Been gone a while, kiddo.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.679
I went to Reno today.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.042
I know. He called.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.522
I'm goin' upstairs.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.567
May I come in?

06:55.840 --> 06:57.963
May I come in?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.079
- I need to talk to you.
- You need to talk to everybody lately.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.839
- Please, don't be glib.
- Like I told you, he's my friend. That's all.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.725
Well, he may not be the
friend you think he is.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.519
He's just a guy, all right?
It's just a place.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.039
You have got to talk to
me about the drinking.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.399
I shouldn't have been
driving. I'm sorry.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.279
You shouldn't have been
drinking or visiting nightclubs.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.919
- Are we through?
- No.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.771
You could've been killed
in that accident.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.086
I know you're having difficulty.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.401
- If you're having feelings...
- I don't know what it is

07:43.440 --> 07:46.480
you think I feel, but you're blowing
this whole thing out of proportion.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.081
He offered to stay away from you.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.239
- What?
- For money.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.091
He said if I paid him,
he'd stay away.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.083
Five thousand dollars.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.679
- I don't believe you.
- I'm sorry. It's true.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.839
- He said you'd tell me things.
- Oh, Beau, stop.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.359
Would I lie to you?

08:15.360 --> 08:17.719
Was Darby with you Friday night?

08:17.720 --> 08:19.919
Just let it go.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.919
I don't want you
seeing him anymore.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.959
Do we have to talk about this now?

08:23.960 --> 08:25.519
I don't want you going into Reno.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.199
We can put the music lessons
on hold for a while.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.165
Margaret? It's Tom.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.808
Yes. Tom, it's Margaret.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.808
It's good to hear you too.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.210
Everything's fine.
We're all fine. What?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.648
I can't hear you.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.519
Yeah, Dylan's helping me.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.247
He's making X's on the calendar.
Don't you disappoint him.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.170
Beau...

09:06.920 --> 09:10.249
Well, hold on a sec.
He's right here.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.045
Hi.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.879
I'm fine. Yeah, same stuff.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.321
Yeah, school, water polo, you know.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.919
No, no. No answers yet.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.799
No, Wesleyan lost my transcripts.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.639
Yeah.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.287
I'm not playing as much as I'd
like, but I'm enjoying the classes.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.768
No, the drive's been fine.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.331
Yeah, I miss you too.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.199
Are you crazy?
That's my mother's room!

10:39.200 --> 10:42.119
- It's me.
- Yeah, I can see that.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.239
What do you say?
You wanna have some fun?

10:44.240 --> 10:47.039
No. Just go away. You're
gonna wake everyone up.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.159
Come on!

10:48.160 --> 10:51.807
Shh! Just go away.
Someone's gonna see you.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.726
Hey, I came all the way from Reno.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.839
- Come on.
- All right.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.119
Quiet. Just be quiet.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.130
I'll be right down. Don't move.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.885
You make a sound, I'm gonna
drown you in the lake.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.885
Come on.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.368
Whatever you say, lover.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.289
Light a match or something.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.482
Ah. Much better.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.125
I'm sorry about my mother.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.159
I thought I was your little secret.
Imagine my surprise.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.679
No, she knew I was at the club
Friday night. All right? That's all.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.884
- She doesn't really know...
- She knows. Believe me.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.399
- Why... Why are you saying that?
- Beau-Beau.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.728
She's a mother, not a moron.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.926
Shut up.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.239
She was bound to find out sooner or later.
That's the way these things work.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.359
Look, I just don't want you
talking to her anymore, okay?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.359
- Or to anyone else, for that matter.
- All right.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.519
No, no one. I'm serious.
It's my business.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.088
- If I choose to tell...
- Whatever you want, precious.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.359
What did you talk to her about?

13:08.360 --> 13:11.319
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.568
Well, not much.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.319
You gotta relax, beauty.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.763
Why? What'd she tell you?

13:21.360 --> 13:23.528
Did she ask you to
stay away from me?

13:25.240 --> 13:28.159
- I believe she did.
- And?

13:28.160 --> 13:30.249
And I...

13:32.440 --> 13:35.359
All right, I...

13:35.360 --> 13:37.119
I told her I might be amenable

13:37.120 --> 13:40.199
to a little... negotiation.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.164
Friendly to an offer.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.004
Beau?

13:49.400 --> 13:51.523
To stop seeing me?

13:53.760 --> 13:56.759
- Of course I was lying. You know that.
- I know what?

13:56.760 --> 14:00.239
That you tried to steal
money from my mother?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.639
It's only money. Don't
take it so personally.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.079
- Look, I need money. Haven't you noticed...
- Get off me. Get off me.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.568
- I tend to overindulge?
- I said, don't touch me!

14:17.160 --> 14:19.328
That hurt, you little fuck.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.799
Hey, come on. Come on.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.159
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.966
- I'm sorry. Beau...
- Get off my arm.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.159
Jesus, Beau, you're not
being a very good host.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.959
Get out. Get out of here.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.286
Easy, tiger.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.959
Get the fuck outta here.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.844
That hurt.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.319
Hey, Beau. Beau. Beau,
come on. Come on.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.205
Beau... Beau.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.800
Jesus, Beau.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.645
Beau, what...

15:54.360 --> 15:56.562
Sweetheart, what happened?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.403
Beau?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.401
I thought I was the only one up.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.085
- You're sure I shouldn't go?
- Yes. I'll be right back.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.279
Problem?

17:03.280 --> 17:05.079
No, just the wind.

17:05.079 --> 17:08.489
- Did I, uh, hear Beau earlier?
- No, I don't think so.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.202
Why don't you get to bed?
It's late.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.968
Margaret, is that you?

17:26.119 --> 17:27.959
- You're up early.
- Trouble sleeping.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.119
- Going for a swim?
- Too cold.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.926
Just a walk.
Maybe I'll run a little.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.839
Where have you been?
I lost my mitt. I can't find it.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.281
- It's around. We'll find it.
- Were you out on the boat?

24:31.600 --> 24:35.039
- Is Paige ready to go?
- You've been AWOL quite a while, Maggie.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.239
- Did you enjoy the walk?
- Did you look under your bed?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.119
Why were you out in the boat?

24:39.120 --> 24:42.290
Go look under your bed.
Paige, the Lloyds are here!

24:44.800 --> 24:47.479
- Is Beau up?
- Beau? No, I haven't seen him.

24:47.480 --> 24:50.319
So, you took a spin on the lake?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.602
Paige, slow down, please.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.439
- Hey, hey, gangplank.
- Honey, the Lloyds are waiting.

24:56.440 --> 24:59.159
Where were you all morning?

24:59.160 --> 25:01.761
Mom, I can't find it.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.960
Dylan, please,
it's time to go, now.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.959
You'll just have to borrow from one of
the other boys. It won't be so bad.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.680
- You can't just borrow another kid's mitt.
- Of course you can.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.279
Who's gonna let me
borrow their mitt?

25:17.280 --> 25:18.839
- Dad told me...
- You'll work it out, Dyl.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.919
People like to share. Go on.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.079
Running late?

25:22.080 --> 25:24.439
Yeah. Sorry.
Lost track of the time.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.999
Do you mind picking up? I have a
tennis thing I can't get out of.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.879
- Well, if you can't, then...
- No, I'll manage.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.242
- It's not a problem.
- Okay, great. Bye-bye.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.919
- What happened last night?
- Wesleyan wants another music sample.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.361
I'm being considered for a grant.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.968
I need $50 for the session.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.599
All right. So, what
happened last night?

30:40.600 --> 30:43.804
Can you give me a ride? 'Cause
I'm late for water polo already.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.286
Beau.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.639
Look, what do you want me to say?

30:52.640 --> 30:55.241
That you were right?
Fine, you were right, okay?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.599
I just want to know what happened.

30:58.600 --> 31:02.239
- Look, I'm already late.
- You're bruised and scraped.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.119
Something happened,
and you've got to tell me...

31:05.120 --> 31:07.049
Oh! There you are.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.483
I thought we were gonna take
that skiff out for a spin.

31:13.920 --> 31:17.319
I just got back. Beau
needs a ride to school.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.999
- Will you be all right for a little while?
- I was out on the dock.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.168
I couldn't see you there.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.879
Found this, anyway, on the beach
in the sand, plain as day.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.999
I'm surprised you didn't see it this
morning, Margaret, on your walk.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.929
No, no, I didn't.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.044
What happened to your face?

32:01.200 --> 32:03.999
You're... You're not
gonna say anything

32:04.000 --> 32:07.966
to Dad, you know,
about-about last night?

32:09.280 --> 32:10.845
No.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.401
All right. I'll find
a ride back. Bye.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.799
I think that boy ballerinas
just don't look right.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.319
They look so funny.

33:30.320 --> 33:33.239
I perfectly agree with you.

33:33.240 --> 33:37.079
You know, he put on his
tights the wrong way.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.919
I think... I think he's very funny.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.599
- I don't know.
- Hey!

33:41.600 --> 33:45.691
Are you sure you're
not getting a crush?

33:48.280 --> 33:50.482
Oh. yeah?

33:51.520 --> 33:53.559
Hey, look.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.759
What's going on?
Did somebody drown?

33:56.760 --> 33:58.689
Something like that, kid.
Keep moving.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.324
Yes, I'm trying to get through
to Captain Thomas Hall.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.967
The <i>U.S.S. Constellation.</i>

34:20.239 --> 34:22.839
His wife, Margaret.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.088
Please don't put me on hold again.

34:30.320 --> 34:33.763
I need to speak to
him today. Right now.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.683
Yes, I realize they left port.
I told you, I'm his wife.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.051
Well, no, it's not
exactly an emergency.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.722
His wife, Margaret.

35:02.720 --> 35:05.919
All right. No, no message.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.610
Thank you.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.930
He's dead.

35:45.480 --> 35:49.319
Darby's dead. He was
killed Monday night.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.239
- The night he was here.
- Beau...

35:51.240 --> 35:52.851
It's in the paper. Look.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.450
Did he know other people in Tahoe?

36:04.720 --> 36:07.890
How should I know?
He knew everybody.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.599
The police are saying...

36:16.600 --> 36:18.882
They're saying someone
murdered him.

36:19.280 --> 36:22.239
Did anybody else
know he was coming?

36:22.240 --> 36:25.011
Did anybody know you were friends?

36:27.440 --> 36:29.679
Does it matter? Mom, he's dead.

36:29.680 --> 36:33.805
I don't know. Do you think the
police will want to speak with you?

36:37.040 --> 36:41.165
I don't know.

36:47.880 --> 36:52.519
Must be a real relief to you, though, huh?
I mean, him being dead and all.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.959
- Oh, Beau, please. No.
- That's gotta have some appeal.

36:54.960 --> 36:59.119
- I mean, can't bother you, can't bother me.
- Stop it, for Christ's sake!

36:59.120 --> 37:00.799
You know, you were right, Mom.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.731
He was a loser. Now,
it's just in the paper.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.799
Mom? Oh.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.279
There's some man downstairs.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.159
He wanted to talk to Dad,
but I told him that...

37:17.160 --> 37:18.679
Who'd he say he is?

37:18.680 --> 37:20.359
He didn't.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.528
All right, I'm coming.

37:32.520 --> 37:35.679
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.519
- I came to see Tom Hall.
- He isn't in.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.690
I can wait. I told
that to the girl.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.370
I'm his wife.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.079
- When will he be back?
- He won't be.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.770
Not today.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.723
What exactly is it you want?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.646
I came to talk about Darby Reese...

37:57.800 --> 37:59.923
And your son.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.039
- Dylan?
- What, Mom?

38:09.040 --> 38:12.767
- I need you to play somewhere else.
- What?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.890
I need to speak with this man.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.927
- Promise you won't touch the computer?
- Yes, I promise.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.602
I think you know Darby Reese.

38:26.400 --> 38:29.809
So, uh, you must know he's dead.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.691
Murdered.

38:36.240 --> 38:40.799
Your son's been spending a
lot of time with Mr. Reese.

38:40.800 --> 38:44.129
Like, special time.
Sort of intimate.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.443
I forgot my fish book.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.399
Dyl? Dyl? No more interruptions.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.887
- You understand? Okay.
- Mm-hmm. Sorry.

39:01.080 --> 39:05.599
We know Darby was coming here
Monday night to see Beau,

39:05.600 --> 39:07.599
the night he was killed.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.759
- "We?"
- Yeah, I have a partner.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.919
- A partner?
- Yes.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.839
- Well, Beau's done nothing wrong.
- Maybe.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.759
I said, he's done nothing wrong.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.799
So why haven't you
gone to the police?

39:17.800 --> 39:20.239
Why don't they know that
your son and Darby were...

39:20.240 --> 39:21.959
Is there a point to this?

39:21.960 --> 39:25.359
We think your son is mixed up
in a murder. That's the point.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.085
I think you should go now.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.559
Have you been listening to me?

39:29.560 --> 39:31.799
No, I... I really...
I think you should go.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.639
Will you just shut up?
What... What's wrong with you?

39:34.640 --> 39:35.759
You think this is a game?

39:35.760 --> 39:39.601
That I've come to chat? To offer
advice? What... To warn you?

39:40.320 --> 39:42.329
Does it work, your video machine?

39:43.880 --> 39:45.879
- Put this in.
- I... I...

39:45.880 --> 39:48.481
I said, put it in the machine!

39:55.680 --> 39:57.644
It belonged to Darby.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.479
He owed us money.
We thought it worthless,

40:01.480 --> 40:03.364
but not now.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.406
Now it has value.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.851
Now we are sure it has value.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.045
- So, play it.
- It's playing.

40:30.440 --> 40:32.529
Like movies?

40:57.520 --> 41:00.639
- Please shut it off. Please.
- Forty minutes

41:00.640 --> 41:02.604
of budding sexuality.

41:12.520 --> 41:15.599
$50,000 by tomorrow,

41:15.600 --> 41:18.770
or there'll be a copy
with the Tahoe police.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.799
Where do you expect me to
get $50,000 in 24 hours?

41:23.800 --> 41:25.399
That's not our problem.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.919
And how do I know
that's the only copy?

41:27.920 --> 41:31.090
You don't. That's the
position you're in.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.489
Come up with the money,
you'll own the tape.

41:38.360 --> 41:42.610
You don't want the police involved
any more than they are now.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.599
Margaret? For the love of God,

41:53.600 --> 41:56.479
you gotta talk to those
cleaners about these stains.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.842
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize...

41:59.040 --> 42:00.599
Jack Hall.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.723
Alek Spera.

42:03.600 --> 42:07.319
Jack, Mr. Spera has, uh...

42:07.320 --> 42:08.841
He's helped Tom with some things.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.162
Spera? From the air station?

42:17.520 --> 42:20.319
Please don't come back here.
I'll meet you in town, anywhere,

42:20.320 --> 42:22.799
just not here,
not around my family.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.161
All right.

42:27.480 --> 42:31.279
- The post office?
- Yes, okay, that's fine.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.679
Okay. Tomorrow, 5:00.

42:33.680 --> 42:36.639
And remember, Mrs. Hall, $50,000.

42:36.640 --> 42:40.367
4:00. 4:00. I have the kids.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.687
Okay, 4:00.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.124
Mom?

43:26.760 --> 43:28.724
I'm not going to practice today.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.239
I just can't.

43:31.240 --> 43:33.239
Can you call the school

43:33.240 --> 43:35.919
and let them know?

43:35.920 --> 43:38.361
I... I don't wanna talk to anyone.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.923
Not now.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.439
Well, my... My husband is,
as I explained to you,

43:46.440 --> 43:48.759
he's in the navy, he's on a boat.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.839
He's somewhere in the middle
of the North Atlantic.

43:51.840 --> 43:56.479
It's just not possible for me to,
uh, to get a signature from him.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.919
I mean, what can I say?

43:58.920 --> 44:01.399
Well, you cosigned the mortgage,

44:01.400 --> 44:05.559
so you and your husband will both have
to sign on any future encumbrance.

44:05.560 --> 44:09.079
Now, if it isn't possible to reach your
husband by fax, perhaps we can...

44:09.080 --> 44:11.442
I need the money tomorrow.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.124
I'm sorry.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.205
Hello?

44:47.720 --> 44:50.239
- Here you go, bud.
- Thank you, Beau.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.363
You're the best.

45:11.200 --> 45:14.719
Yes. I'm sorry. No, of course I'm
talking about a current balance.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.844
No, no, 3-0-1-5-5.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.879
Account number 4-8-7-4-3-9...

45:22.880 --> 45:27.559
2-0-1-1-7-9...

45:27.560 --> 45:29.808
2-2-9-1.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.686
No, I'm trying to determine
my credit limit.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.688
The available credit, please.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.759
3-7-8-3...

45:39.760 --> 45:42.879
5-4-9-6.

45:42.880 --> 45:44.999
No, no, 3-3-0-1-5-5...

45:45.000 --> 45:47.239
Jack, I didn't know you...
Can you hold on a minute?

45:47.240 --> 45:48.885
- Your laundry, Jack.
- Mm-hmm.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.919
Mm-hmm. Oh, these damn tweezers.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.039
I thought I might have
my lunch early today.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.049
All right, I'll bring it up.

45:55.840 --> 45:58.725
Well, can we do it on the
phone as an advance?

46:03.120 --> 46:05.527
All right, good-bye.

47:14.600 --> 47:15.879
I'm sorry.

47:15.880 --> 47:17.319
<i>You okay, Beau?</i>

47:17.320 --> 47:21.320
- Can we start it again?
<i>- Relax, kiddo. They're gonna love ya.</i>

47:59.400 --> 48:02.001
Oh, my God. It's so ugly.

48:04.400 --> 48:07.479
<i>No, I have to have it
immediately. Today.</i>

48:07.480 --> 48:10.839
<i>1-9-7-7-3-4...</i>

48:10.840 --> 48:14.319
<i>I just wanna know how quickly
we can have the cash.</i>

48:14.320 --> 48:17.719
<i>H-A-L-L. I'll hold.</i>

48:17.720 --> 48:20.479
<i>Yes? Hall.</i>

48:20.480 --> 48:21.759
<i>No, the cash, not credit.</i>

48:21.760 --> 48:23.079
<i>Please don't transfer me. Please.</i>

48:23.080 --> 48:25.359
<i>I'm not interested
in a personal limit.</i>

48:25.360 --> 48:29.279
Lonergan. Mary Lonergan.
Can you say that again?

48:29.280 --> 48:30.839
Thank you.

48:30.840 --> 48:33.319
Hall. H-A-double-L.

48:33.320 --> 48:35.249
<i>No, I have to have it immediately.</i>

48:35.840 --> 48:37.559
<i>Mine? November 5, 1960.</i>

48:37.560 --> 48:38.839
Margaret.

48:38.840 --> 48:41.919
<i>I can't reach him.
Account number 6-0-1-1...</i>

48:41.920 --> 48:43.319
3-1 -6-3.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.479
<i>Yes, that means I can't
get his signature.</i>

48:45.480 --> 48:47.364
O-O-9-7...

48:48.720 --> 48:49.879
<i>My mailing address is</i>

48:49.880 --> 48:53.039
<i>7087 Lakeshore,</i>

48:53.040 --> 48:56.210
<i>Tahoe City, California, 96145.</i>

50:01.960 --> 50:04.083
<i>No, don't bother calling back.</i>

50:04.400 --> 50:06.759
<i>Because we won't need
it at Christmas.</i>

50:06.760 --> 50:08.530
Thank you.

50:09.920 --> 50:13.681
Jack? Leave that for Beau.
He'll be home soon.

50:14.760 --> 50:18.039
Oh, don't be silly. It's
just a bottle of water.

50:18.040 --> 50:21.687
- Well, thanks.
- It's good for the back.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.919
- Ooh, I think.
- Jack,

50:24.920 --> 50:27.119
can I talk with you
about something?

50:27.120 --> 50:28.765
Surely.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.608
I have a problem.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.919
I need some money.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.168
- Oh?
- I know this is awkward.

50:44.200 --> 50:47.210
Don't be silly. How much?

50:48.520 --> 50:50.559
Uh, no, that isn't...

50:50.560 --> 50:52.125
Well?

50:53.200 --> 50:54.970
The thing is...

50:57.240 --> 51:00.683
Well, come on, Maggie. Spit it out.
My back's tightening up.

51:03.800 --> 51:06.082
The thing is, I'm not really sure.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.039
- Why don't I go and check my purse again?
- Here.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.208
Take...

51:12.080 --> 51:14.119
Take 80.

51:14.120 --> 51:17.688
And if you need any
more, let me know.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.609
All right, Jack.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.202
This is the last one.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.879
Jack, I really don't
think you should...

51:55.880 --> 51:57.081
Jack?

51:57.960 --> 52:00.242
- Jack!
- Margaret...

52:01.280 --> 52:02.766
Jack?

52:05.160 --> 52:07.488
Jack? Jack?

52:07.560 --> 52:10.001
Can you hear me, Jack?

52:26.880 --> 52:29.319
Wanna see my mom again?

52:29.320 --> 52:31.239
Yeah, I do.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.399
You could come in. Mom!

52:34.400 --> 52:38.366
Two, three, four.

52:41.480 --> 52:43.921
Dylan, call 9-1-1.

52:47.360 --> 52:50.609
Go. Tell them we need an ambulance.

52:52.080 --> 52:56.285
Two, three, four, five.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.530
Jack?

52:58.920 --> 53:00.719
Use more strength.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.159
Press harder.

53:02.160 --> 53:04.647
Do you know how to do this?
Can you do this?

53:08.080 --> 53:09.759
Tilt his head back.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.803
One breath when I hit five.

53:11.880 --> 53:16.324
One, two, three, four, five.

53:19.400 --> 53:23.810
One, two, three, four, five.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.879
One, two, three, four, five.

53:28.880 --> 53:32.129
Mommy, they said they're
coming in five minutes.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.919
- One, two, three...
- Dylan, I need your help.

53:36.920 --> 53:38.719
- Four, five.
- Can you go upstairs and get me a pillow?

53:38.720 --> 53:40.524
- Dylan, please?
- Five! Go!

53:43.960 --> 53:48.802
One, two, three, four, five.

53:52.200 --> 53:56.849
One, two, three, four, five.

53:57.360 --> 53:59.847
Jack? Jack?

54:00.160 --> 54:02.840
Jack, can you hear me? Jack?

54:06.480 --> 54:08.479
Oh, Margaret. Oh...

54:08.480 --> 54:09.959
Just lie still.

54:09.960 --> 54:12.083
Everything's fine.

54:15.240 --> 54:18.808
- Everything's fine.
- Mom?

54:19.000 --> 54:22.329
It's okay, Dyl. Everything's fine.

55:21.520 --> 55:26.089
<i>Mom? Mom, are you there?
Pick up if you're there.</i>

55:26.880 --> 55:28.764
<i>Where are you?</i>

55:29.240 --> 55:33.079
<i>Um, well, I'm at Amber's. She needs
a ride tomorrow night to ballet.</i>

55:33.080 --> 55:34.599
<i>I hope that's okay.</i>

55:34.600 --> 55:37.485
<i>Oh, and I'm gonna stay
here for dinner, okay?</i>

55:37.520 --> 55:40.803
<i>Um, all right. Bye.</i>

57:14.440 --> 57:16.244
Hello?

57:16.920 --> 57:18.849
Where's my mother?

57:19.080 --> 57:21.089
She's, uh...

57:21.440 --> 57:24.246
Your grandfather, he had a...

57:25.600 --> 57:27.962
You should call the hospital.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.725
And who are you?

57:33.880 --> 57:35.570
I'm, uh...

57:36.520 --> 57:38.359
I know your father.

57:38.360 --> 57:40.927
I'm a friend of your father's,

57:40.960 --> 57:43.242
and I was, uh...

57:44.840 --> 57:46.326
Leaving.

57:56.080 --> 57:58.647
I've been tryin' your
cell phone all day.

58:00.400 --> 58:03.888
Why haven't I heard from you?

58:04.480 --> 58:06.364
I had nothing to say.

58:07.240 --> 58:08.930
Right.

58:14.080 --> 58:15.839
You should have called.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.610
Where's the money?

58:18.760 --> 58:20.291
Why?

58:21.080 --> 58:23.239
- I'll go back tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow?

58:23.240 --> 58:24.759
Why is tomorrow different?

58:24.760 --> 58:27.039
Because it is.
I couldn't get it today.

58:27.040 --> 58:30.881
Of course you could. You
could have, but you didn't.

58:31.120 --> 58:34.479
- Look, I want that money.
- Yeah.

58:34.480 --> 58:37.639
And so do you.
You do understand me?

58:37.640 --> 58:40.759
- I said I'd take care of it.
- All right. Fine.

58:40.760 --> 58:43.599
I trust you, Alek,
like I trust myself.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.399
You say you're gonna get the
money, you get the money.

58:46.400 --> 58:50.519
But, goddamn it, you better get
that son-of-a-bitch fuckin' money,

58:50.520 --> 58:54.439
'cause this is a good piece of business,
and I'm not gonna walk away from it.

58:54.440 --> 58:57.610
I don't know what the
fuck's goin' on with you.

58:58.280 --> 59:01.799
All right. Tomorrow,
Alek, right? I'm trusting you.

59:01.800 --> 59:05.004
And if you can't carry
through, I will.

59:18.800 --> 59:21.241
<i>Yes, Jack Hall.
I'm his daughter-in-law.</i>

59:21.400 --> 59:23.959
No, we just came from the hospital.

59:23.960 --> 59:26.606
He said sometime in
the next two days.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.847
All right. Will someone call?

59:47.160 --> 59:50.409
Please. Tonight. Thank you.

59:52.200 --> 59:53.731
Mom?

59:55.880 --> 59:58.919
- Did you talk with the hospital?
- Yes.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.239
- How is he?
- I don't know.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.519
I'll be right back.
There's someone...

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.087
I have to speak with
someone outside.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.079
I did mean to come yesterday.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.439
I waited almost an hour
at the post office.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.199
- I'm sorry about that.
- You were not coming, Mrs. Hall.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.768
- You were here. You saw what happened.
- You were not coming.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.799
Did you get the money?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.570
No.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.599
- I'm not sure you understand the situation.
- We don't have the money.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.159
You have to get the money.
Is that not clear enough?

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.399
It's $50,000. It is not the kind of thing
that everyone can just go out and get.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.759
Have you spoken with your husband?

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.239
He can't be reached. He's on a
carrier somewhere in the nor...

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.239
This is truly none
of your business.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.250
What about... The old man?

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.959
Well, you have to try harder.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.679
- "Try harder?"
- I don't think you're really trying.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.679
- Really?
- Yes.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.239
Well, maybe you should explain
"really trying" to me, Mr. Spera.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.683
Tell me, how would you be
"really trying" if you were me?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.119
But you're not me, are you?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.559
You don't have my petty concerns to
clutter your life and keep you from trying.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.279
You don't have three kids to feed,

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.599
or worry about the future
of a 17-year-old boy

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.639
who nearly got himself killed

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.239
driving back from some
kind of a nightclub

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.081
with his 30-year-old friend sitting
drunk in the seat beside him.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.002
No, these are not your
concerns. I see that.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.405
But perhaps you're right, Mr. Spera.
Perhaps I could be trying a little harder.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.519
Maybe sometime tomorrow between
dropping Dylan at baseball practice

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.759
and picking up my father-in-law
from the hospital,

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.009
I might find a way to
try a little harder.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.086
Maybe I should take a
page from your book.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.930
Go to the track,

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.648
find a card game.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.762
Maybe I should blackmail someone.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.529
Or maybe you have another idea.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.159
I mean, maybe you
have a better idea

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.639
of how I might try a little harder

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.049
to find this $50,000 you've
come here to steal from me.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.331
You're right. I'm not you.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.329
I don't...

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.439
This is only a business
opportunity. That's all.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.530
What kind of a
heartless man are you?

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.688
Do you ever get away from
your family, Mrs. Hall?

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.887
I'll talk to Nagle about the time.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.488
- Maybe he'll listen.
- Mom!

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.239
I'm sorry. You don't know
what kind of a man Nagle is.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.399
Please, just go. Leave
my family out of this.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.649
- It's getting late. Paige needs to go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.443
- Is everything okay?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.325
- I'll get it!
- Dylan... Mom.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.250
Hall residence, Dylan speaking.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.367
One minute, please.
It's for you. Mr. "Sparrow?"

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.723
I'll take it upstairs.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.599
Okay, Dylan. Hang up, please.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.199
Why are you calling me here?

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.563
<i>I need to speak with you.
I'm sorry. Please, listen.</i>

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.887
You only need to raise 25,000.
I told Nagle I won't take my share.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.130
I don't want it now.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.728
If I could make him go away,
stop bothering you, I would.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.519
I wish I could... Go back,

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.848
but I... But I can't.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.359
He wants that money,

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.962
and he'll make things ugly for you
if he doesn't get it, I promise.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.879
Do you hear me?
It's not so much now.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.399
- Why are you doing this?
- Please just do as I say.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.568
Just get the money.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.761
Are you there?

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.079
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.239
Yes, I think so.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.728
<i>Meet me in Reno tomorrow, 3:00.</i>

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.479
Harrah's, outside.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.842
<i>- All right.</i>
- Can you find it?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.399
- Harrah's Casino?
- Yes.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.331
Tomorrow. It's not
much time, I know.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.603
No.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.519
If you keep giving it gas,
you're gonna flood it.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.639
Paige, can you do something?

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.842
Where are you going?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.759
The car, sweetheart. I'm late.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.167
Okay. Pop it.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.599
- Problem?
- It's nothing.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.879
My daughter'll fix it.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.119
Make somebody a great
husband someday, huh?

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.959
- Can I help you?
- Hope so.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.799
Talkin' to the residents around the
lake about the murder at Buck's Cove.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.079
- You heard about that?
- Okay, try it, and don't...

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.647
I know.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.959
Okay!

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.039
Yes, we heard about it.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.403
It seems the victim was killed with
an anchor. Pierced his lungs.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.119
And we were thinkin' that
anchor could have come

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.243
from one of these
houses around here.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.319
Well, our dinghy doesn't have
an anchor. We tie it to the dock.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.682
- Always?
- Yes.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.680
All right. Like I said,
just checkin'.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.682
If you think of anything,
give us a call.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.210
Okay.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.091
I'm stumped. What did he want?

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.919
You can't fix it?

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.319
I don't know.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:22.569
No, I guess not. You probably
clogged the fuel lines.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.486
- You know, Beau's car...
- So I'll call a taxi.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.679
- Where are you going anyway?
- Just some errands.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.279
I'll be back before dinner.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.639
Well, how am I supposed
to get to ballet?

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.683
Sue's stopping by.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.321
7087 Lakeshore Court.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.770
Tahoe City.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.727
Yes. I'll wait outside. Thank you.

01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:56.450
You look nice.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.606
- What's going on?
- Nothing, just some errands in town.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.719
You're taking a taxi?

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.888
Yeah. The Jeep won't start.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:08.091
You know, I could drive you.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.249
No, I prefer to be alone.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.601
<i>You sure you wanna hock this stuff?</i>

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.279
Yes. How much do you think?

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.759
Uh, I could go at 8,500,

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.883
maybe 8,600.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.719
Well, I w... I was hoping
that you could give me more.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.002
8,600 is more.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.679
Margaret, stop!

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.319
- Where's your car?
- It wouldn't start.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.039
I don't have all the money.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.359
I could only raise 12,000,
a little more than 12,000.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.927
Here. Please say it's enough.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.639
- I need to talk to you.
- I've gotta go.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.919
Just for a minute.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.679
Jack's waiting to be picked up.
I'm already late.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.039
I'll drive you back to Tahoe.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.119
No, thank you. Could you
help me find a cab?

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.479
I need to talk to you, please.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.603
Things have changed.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.607
The seat belt is above the door.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.408
- The hospital, not the house?
- Yes.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.768
No, thank you.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.608
I took you for a smoker.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.402
They, uh, arrested someone
for Darby's murder.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.959
- That's impossible.
- It's more than possible.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.399
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.931
Who is it?

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.439
- His name is Donnelly, Martin Donnelly.
- He didn't do it.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.319
Like I said, it doesn't matter.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.119
Nagle's lost the advantage,
but he'll make a deal, with you.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.839
He'll want to make a deal.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.168
Donnelly didn't kill Darby.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.239
- What?
- I know that.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.044
- You don't.
- I do.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.291
- How? How?
- It's not important.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.964
Darby...

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.281
Darby came to our house
that night, to see Beau.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.803
I'd gone to his nightclub
earlier in the day.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.359
Beau had been in a car accident.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.767
He'd been drinking with Darby.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.291
You see,

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.884
my husband...

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.049
He won't understand as
it is, his son being...

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.687
I don't know how to
talk to him about it.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.768
He's away at sea so often.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.204
It's not that...

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.561
I must sound very silly to you.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.090
I just wanted him to
stay away from Beau,

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.601
but I failed.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.399
He came to the house that night.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.570
They fought in the boathouse.
I don't know why.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.719
I heard these noises,
and I came down.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.729
Beau had run back in.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.839
I met Darby on the dock.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.799
We argued.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.359
I pushed him, and he fell
through the railing.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.324
- You pushed him?
- Yes.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.479
- And?
- And the railing...

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.048
It just gave way, and
he fell onto the anchor.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.879
- And I moved the body.
- You?

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.919
Yes. In the boat, in the morning.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.999
- Alone?
- Of course, alone.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.879
- Stop this. I don't believe you.
- I don't care what you believe.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.809
It is what happened.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.759
- And I have to tell them.
- Tell them what?

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.247
- That you killed a man?
- Yes!

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.479
This is crazy.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.639
Whatever happened that
night is over, done.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.439
- It can't be undone.
- Not "undone," but...

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.159
I can put an end to this,
to Nagle's threats, to all this!

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.091
Listen, stop it! J... Just stop it!

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.559
It's too late for that.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.206
Whatever happened, it's too late.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.959
Listen to me. You have your
family to think about,

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.559
the life of your
family, not Donnelly.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:13.479
Forget all of this. Forget Donnelly,
forget Nagle... And me.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.399
Go home.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.570
Put all this behind you
as if it never happened.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.962
Do you hear me, Margaret?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.170
Margaret.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.519
<i>Hello, you've reached the Halls.</i>

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.919
<i>Leave us your name and number,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.119
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.449
Hi, it's mom. I'm running late.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.967
If the hospital calls, just...

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.128
Never mind. I'll be home...
I'll be home soon.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.839
Hi. Um, I got a call that my
grandfather was waiting?

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:27.999
Mm-hmm?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.319
- To be picked up.
- Name?

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.490
Jack Hall. I think my mother was
supposed to come and get him. Is he...

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.479
Great, thanks.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.359
<i>Are you sure you don't want
to keep the wheelchair?</i>

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.199
Don't be ridiculous.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.210
It's bad enough they
saddled me with this.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.722
This thing's a wreck.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.439
Want me to take your cane? I can
put it in the back or something.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.971
No.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.930
- How will you get home?
- I'll get a taxi.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.039
You know, I never thanked
you for your help with Jack.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.242
I was there. That's all.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.764
His heart had stopped.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.924
It happens.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.682
Nagle, it's Alek.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.599
I don't know when I'll hear.
Columbia sent back my tapes,

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.928
and Wesleyan asked for
another one, so...

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.199
- What about Annapolis?
- I didn't apply to Annapolis.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.210
Shame. It's a fine schoo...

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.044
Why don't we go... Let's lie down.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.959
I think he was in 3-1-3.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.844
You already told me that.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.119
Well, he can't have disappeared.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.924
Take a breath, huh?

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.690
He was checked out to a Beau Hall.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.486
<i>It's time to stop this, that's all.</i>

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.766
She came up with 12,000.
There is no more.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:06.519
No, the husband's on a boat somewhere.
It won't happen through him.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.326
<i>We got what we could.
Let it go now.</i>

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:18.239
Battleships.
I never liked carriers.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.999
Who was the guy who used to
give us those helicopter rides?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.679
You know, in Virginia.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.039
No one ever gave you
helicopter rides.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.519
Yeah, don't you remember?
You know, the tall guy?

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.491
- That's hogwash!
- I'll be right back, all right?

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.401
And no helo rides!

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.679
Not on my watch.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.639
<i>So, explain it to me again.
Maybe I'm stupid.</i>

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.239
Yeah, well, I already told you.
Donnelly will be out by tomorrow,

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.479
in which case we have
what we had all along.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.879
You've got most of what you
wanted. It's over. It's enough.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.079
<i>I don't want most. I want all.</i>

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.559
<i>Why is it so hard for
you to understand that?</i>

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.199
I'm warning you, Carlie,
don't be greedy.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.759
<i>It's not your place to warn me.
You should know that.</i>

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.879
It's not your place.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:08.802
Jesus. What the hell is she
doing in a taxi in Tahoe?

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.799
I asked you to handle
this. You did not.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.239
<i>I don't know why. I'm confused.</i>

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.489
<i>- But I'm gonna do this now.</i>

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.079
- Who are you?
- I think you know my partner.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.959
Please go. I can't talk
to you. Not here.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.969
You'll talk to me.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.839
- What do you want?
- Just the money.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.439
I just want the money.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.679
- I gave it to Alek.
- Part. You gave him part.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.879
- I don't want part.
- He said that Donnelly...

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.479
Donnelly didn't kill Darby.
It's idiotic.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.399
The police will know soon enough.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.761
Just get out of my house!

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.079
This is a problem, and I would
like to resolve it now.

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.639
I'll try and be clear. I think
you've been lying to Al.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.639
I think you've put
ideas in his head.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.159
I think you have the money.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.843
I think you haven't been altogether
straightforward with us.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.361
If you want to know the truth.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.440
What kind of a fool
do you think I am?

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.599
Would I risk anything
if I had the money?

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.359
Maybe.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.679
Where's your husband?

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.159
I'd like to talk with him, because
I don't want this going on any longer,

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.569
and I can't seem to get any kind
of straight answer from you.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.283
Carlie.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.879
Alek, go away.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.208
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.479
I told you not to come here.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.759
That was not your right.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.719
- You lost control.
- That's not important.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.526
Al, please. Please, go. Go away.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.039
- This woman's made a fool of you.
- Think what you want.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.959
Yes, a stupid, stupid fool.
A weakling...

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.479
- You've behaved like a stupid weakling.
- Shut up.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.879
Are you fucking her?
Is that what's going on?

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.479
- Is that it? You're fucking her?
- I said, shut up.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.047
Don't talk to me that way!

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.039
Get out of here.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.210
- Don't push this, Al.
- Get out.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.721
Alek.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.484
Alek, I...

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.679
Alek, please...

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.679
I...

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.879
- Alek...
- Be quiet.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.845
- No!
- Alek, please, I beg you, don't.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.763
I'll go to the police.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.279
I'll tell them about Darby.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.404
I'll tell them you killed
Nagle in self-defense.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.559
Oh, Margaret.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.444
I'll go to the police, Alek.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.249
I'm sorry.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.448
It shouldn't have come to this.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.079
Alek.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.884
Alek.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.721
We have no choice now.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.767
Please. You gotta let me tell 'em.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.287
Please.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.399
Listen to me. Go inside.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.524
No one can be near the windows.
Think of something... Anything.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.479
Just keep your family away.
Meet me in the driveway.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.879
We'll go together. Take
my car keys. In my coat.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.242
On the right, in the pocket.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.319
I'll drive Nagle's car.
You follow in mine.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.519
But you must go inside.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.643
I'll wait in the driveway.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.371
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.044
No.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.210
No.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.971
Mom?

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.683
What's going on?

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.322
- Your lip. Jesus...
- Beau, I need you to help me.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.439
Where are you going?

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.279
I can't drive this. The shift...

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.719
- Mom. Mom...
- I need you to drive the car, please.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.519
Please, we need to leave now.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.281
Can you help me? Just...
Please, just help me.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.999
It's a gray car. Did you
see it in the driveway?

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.089
No.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.971
There. Is that it?

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.127
He shouldn't have left like that.
He should have waited.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.479
It's not what you think.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.159
How do you know what I think?

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.409
- He's a friend.
- Yeah.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.606
That's all. He's just a friend.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.168
Did you see that?

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.204
Beau! Beau, please, call for help!

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.330
Alek! Alek!

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.199
- You shouldn't have followed me.
- Alek, Jesus!

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.879
Why did you follow me?

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.799
You didn't wait!
Why didn't you wait?

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.479
I lost control of
the car, Margaret.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.287
My arm. Margaret, stop. Stop!

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.567
Margaret, stop. Stop!

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:47.249
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No. Don't! Just leave.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.199
Someone will come.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.239
Oh, Alek.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.519
They'll think he died
here in the crash.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.644
- Please go.
- I can't leave you.

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.719
But you must. They can't
find you here. Think!

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.684
Please, no.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.319
Margaret, the tape...

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.603
And the money... Look for them.

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.923
They were on the seat.
Can you see them?

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.488
Get them out.

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:40.010
- I can't see where...
- Just try.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.487
- Now go.
- No, Alek.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.288
I can't.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.484
Please go.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.089
I'm sorry, Margaret.

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.688
I'm sorry for all of this.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.844
Margaret?

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.844
Yes?

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.002
I think I'm...

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.008
I'm not...

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.289
Alek?

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.045
Mom?

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.920
Do you want me to call somebody?

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.603
No.

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.841
Could you just be here with me?

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.760
All right.

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:40.049
I'm here.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.083
I don't know how...

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.559
I don't know what to say.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.524
So, don't.

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.603
I don't need to know.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.528
It's not important.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.848
I love you, Beau.

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.245
Yeah.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.123
Me, too.

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:41.642
Mom, it's Dad. Can you pick up?

01:37:42.305 --> 01:37:48.931
