13:00.117 --> 13:04.423
You might want to try something better.

13:04.673 --> 13:06.769
Not for your health.

13:06.889 --> 13:08.628
Only this time.

14:16.161 --> 14:19.768
You do not even have a tattoo!

14:22.724 --> 14:25.023
Yakuza is this.

14:25.623 --> 14:27.161
Nonsense.

14:28.164 --> 14:30.292
No nonsense!

14:33.152 --> 14:36.317
Yakuza about it.

14:37.894 --> 14:40.547
That's why we call a tattoo of "resistance."

14:40.685 --> 14:42.702
My skin is sensitive!

14:42.866 --> 14:44.907
You do not know how much...

14:45.870 --> 14:48.659
The durability of leather sensitifku already awake!

14:48.896 --> 14:50.769
Who cares?

Rub the cream on it, bastard!

14:54.390 --> 14:57.664
I'm sick of your attitude.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.648
As long as I can take it...

15:02.059 --> 15:05.268
I do not need tattoos.

15:10.261 --> 15:12.296

15:34.920 --> 15:39.153
No, they try roughing teachers.

15:39.716 --> 15:42.270
Ku told them to be impartial
civilians.

15:42.411 --> 15:44.607
So, I educate them physically.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.615
Who will protect you now?

15:49.913 --> 15:51.273
Tell me, teacher.

15:51.387 --> 15:53.603

17:38.324 --> 17:40.144

17:41.843 --> 17:46.139
If you had one wish...
What is it?

17:49.129 --> 17:50.831

19:16.598 --> 19:17.311
Sorry.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.560
Why are you not with the boss?

19:19.815 --> 19:22.001
He told me to look at you.

19:22.183 --> 19:23.358
What?

19:23.441 --> 19:24.731
Who knows?

19:25.358 --> 19:27.711
He wants you in touch with Kyoko.

19:27.790 --> 19:30.452
He never date with yakuza.

19:31.929 --> 19:33.421

There will come.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.191
Finally came.

20:38.369 --> 20:42.291
Boss, he saved us.

20:42.712 --> 20:45.624
He gives our lives meaning.

20:46.263 --> 20:49.781
We have to hold out until the recession is over.

20:50.251 --> 20:52.187
Masaru got a problem.

20:52.312 --> 20:55.636
But so do we all.

20:55.779 --> 20:57.030
Yes.

20:57.514 --> 21:02.104
shopping area is grateful to the boss.

21:02.741 --> 21:05.598
He keep chains and supermarkets.

21:05.708 --> 21:09.665
I do not fit in with the modern era.

21:09.843 --> 21:11.992
You're a modern child.

21:28.529 --> 21:30.587
You two, go.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.544
Go!

21:48.805 --> 21:50.574
Do not set foot here again.

21:50.772 --> 21:52.986
That's what I say.

21:54.378 --> 21:57.507
This is the last time I asked,...

21:58.105 --> 22:01.252
Did you go back to syndicate
or not?

22:05.219 --> 22:08.817
I'm happy as a clam at high tide right now.

22:09.239 --> 22:13.056
I broke away to live my way.

22:13.839 --> 22:15.658
As yakuza.

22:17.895 --> 22:21.710
This is the best way to die
and end happy.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.452
Excuse me.

22:23.853 --> 22:25.677
What here Akihabara?

24:07.454 --> 24:08.718
Boss!

24:09.153 --> 24:10.623
Fuck you.

24:35.899 --> 24:37.445

26:25.715 --> 26:28.048
He did not have time to chase you.

27:26.333 --> 27:27.863
Boss...

27:35.091 --> 27:38.218
Take my blood...

27:38.569 --> 27:41.264
And walk down the street...

27:41.714 --> 27:44.023
A vampire yakuza!

28:23.949 --> 28:25.169
Where Hogen?

28:25.336 --> 28:26.658
Not here.

28:27.418 --> 28:30.483
There is a knitting class in the basement.

28:30.891 --> 28:31.794
Huh?

28:34.723 --> 28:36.277
What are you doing?

28:37.398 --> 28:38.718
Who?

28:38.938 --> 28:39.754
This is the food.

28:41.508 --> 28:42.893
Food?

28:43.111 --> 28:45.635
They are used as food
Kamiura.

28:48.489 --> 28:49.782
What is it?

28:49.882 --> 28:54.059
Sushita, I think the vampire Japan.

29:01.993 --> 29:04.507
boss is a vampire?

29:05.949 --> 29:10.542
We entrust our lives to a vampire.

29:14.134 --> 29:16.879
Let's move on to the next step.

29:17.061 --> 29:21.339
We can discuss it later.

29:27.378 --> 29:29.025
How's it going?

29:29.169 --> 29:30.158
You know.

29:30.262 --> 29:30.954
I understand.

29:31.077 --> 29:32.268

29:33.425 --> 29:34.967
Hey all!

29:37.123 --> 29:41.038

29:43.517 --> 29:47.367
looked at all that is within me.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.001
What is it?

30:04.084 --> 30:08.995
I want to discuss the plan in detail.

30:09.107 --> 30:15.402
As an important person in the organization,
keep your mouth when speaking to me.

30:18.597 --> 30:22.731
Dirt carried away.

30:23.547 --> 30:25.276
What does it mean?

30:33.533 --> 30:35.459
He will come.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.574
He?

30:38.934 --> 30:40.503
No way!

30:41.015 --> 30:43.743
Who came... sir?

30:43.839 --> 30:46.240
For all intents and purposes...

30:46.347 --> 30:49.251
modern Giant.

30:49.390 --> 30:53.371
the world's most formidable terrorist!

30:53.800 --> 30:55.026
Are you sure?

30:55.611 --> 30:58.656
I say we do not need to do so.

30:59.142 --> 31:01.676
Kyoken strong enough.

31:01.761 --> 31:04.539
But inimitable.

31:04.737 --> 31:07.964
So horrible, you'd laugh.

31:08.217 --> 31:11.610
Why? The boss is dead.

31:12.272 --> 31:17.666
As for why...
my beak sealed.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.116
But...

31:19.696 --> 31:23.936
There will be hell to pay if we do not finish
...

31:25.906 --> 31:29.861
Before he woke up.

31:30.345 --> 31:31.535
He?

31:37.833 --> 31:39.394
<i>What...</i>

31:41.475 --> 31:42.903
<i>What the hell?</i>

31:43.377 --> 31:44.968
Life?

31:50.108 --> 31:52.491
<i>What is this?</i>

31:55.943 --> 31:58.264
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

31:59.686 --> 32:02.399
<i>I'm thirsty.</i>

32:25.700 --> 32:28.126
Why did you run away, you bastard?

32:28.219 --> 32:30.195
Sit down.

32:34.738 --> 32:38.838
Forgive him, I beg you.

32:38.884 --> 32:42.586
Will my-mop the floor with your head!

33:03.369 --> 33:05.589
Do not hurt...

33:09.821 --> 33:14.658
Which is not yakuza.

For that, you have to pay.

33:39.602 --> 33:43.006
By your life!

34:07.836 --> 34:10.560
Hot, Hot.

34:10.976 --> 34:14.489
Heat. I burned...

34:40.127 --> 34:42.786
Do not touch civilians!

35:04.192 --> 35:05.809
Kageyama?

35:06.678 --> 35:08.171
Are you...

35:25.740 --> 35:28.185
"Suck"

35:48.902 --> 35:50.913
honey!

35:53.068 --> 35:56.252
I'm not supposed to hurt civilians.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.259
Idiot! What are you doing?

36:00.968 --> 36:02.740
I'm sorry.

36:06.664 --> 36:10.049
What do I do?

36:12.614 --> 36:14.269
you.

36:15.343 --> 36:20.018
Death! Just kill yourself and die!

36:25.685 --> 36:26.872
Good.

36:34.580 --> 36:36.084
Death!

36:41.846 --> 36:43.679
Nobuko.

36:45.268 --> 36:47.595
There...

37:02.949 --> 37:07.319
No need to apologize, Kagayama.

37:10.551 --> 37:12.843
Fun...

37:15.913 --> 37:19.795
I feel so... happy.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.566
Nobuko.

37:28.254 --> 37:31.680
Do! Stop!
Do not public.

37:31.825 --> 37:35.811
In addition, it has been a long time.

37:39.587 --> 37:42.019
honey!

38:12.645 --> 38:15.074
Mr. Hasegawa? What is it?

38:24.278 --> 38:25.771
Nobuko.

38:28.425 --> 38:30.146
honey!

38:56.364 --> 38:57.543
Everything.

38:59.535 --> 39:01.995
I'm so sorry.

39:08.047 --> 39:11.131
I'm happy to be a yakuza.

39:14.807 --> 39:19.617
I do not regret it.

39:52.782 --> 39:54.588
Wait.

40:08.198 --> 40:09.788
"Goodbye."

40:11.687 --> 40:13.853
Not really...

40:15.561 --> 40:18.871
"For reasons that are personal..."

40:19.031 --> 40:20.317
No.

40:21.524 --> 40:24.707
"Families experiencing an emergency..."

40:25.328 --> 40:26.473
No!

40:27.956 --> 40:31.724
Was wrong.
"More than a feeling..."

40:33.252 --> 40:35.398
It's all about feelings.

40:35.556 --> 40:39.945
More than words, these feelings.

40:40.481 --> 40:44.640
First, I had to hold her and...

40:44.694 --> 40:46.336
Kageyama?

40:48.986 --> 40:51.141
What are you doing here?

40:52.418 --> 40:54.364
Are you okay?

41:19.764 --> 41:22.809
Why still bandaged?

41:24.539 --> 41:26.390
You're cured, right?

41:28.256 --> 41:30.252
I cried all day.

41:32.536 --> 41:35.228
The boss has been killed.

41:35.405 --> 41:37.316
This is beyond belief.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.190
By the way...

41:54.227 --> 41:59.121
There's something you want I ask?

42:00.358 --> 42:04.196
I've been through the ordeal.

42:06.469 --> 42:09.326
I thought losing my sight is not the problem.

42:12.325 --> 42:14.742
But it does not attract attention.

42:15.531 --> 42:18.408
After all the bosses do for me.

42:19.082 --> 42:21.592
Paying the operating costs...

42:22.692 --> 42:27.137
Despite all that happened...

42:27.713 --> 42:29.633
Senyumanmu.

42:30.576 --> 42:32.934
I want to see your smile.

43:16.958 --> 43:18.704
Kageyama.

43:30.699 --> 43:34.631
No, not good.

43:47.018 --> 43:49.193
That hurts.

44:00.217 --> 44:01.589
Never again.

44:01.829 --> 44:05.517
I'm evil... not good.

44:46.748 --> 44:48.131
A dream?

44:52.650 --> 44:54.371
How do you feel?

45:04.839 --> 45:08.617
I had a terrible dream.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.221
What?

45:13.653 --> 45:15.681
Well...

45:16.471 --> 45:22.563
Do you eat soba noodles
but it turns out you eat frog eggs.

45:23.489 --> 45:29.442
Then they grow into tadpoles.
The dream, right?

45:33.061 --> 45:35.150
True...

45:35.448 --> 45:39.540
I understand. You're the real deal.

45:41.245 --> 45:42.923
Blood...

45:43.112 --> 45:48.856
Do you want to limit your intake to 250ml per session.

45:49.063 --> 45:52.095
About the size of soda cans.

45:52.416 --> 45:58.261
Your blood enters your body when you bite.

45:58.416 --> 46:00.843
They will become a vampire yakuza.

46:00.895 --> 46:03.021
Blood civilians tastes good.

46:03.075 --> 46:05.456
This causes the addiction.

46:05.670 --> 46:09.387
Blood yakuza
bad taste and low in nutrients.

46:09.629 --> 46:13.640
You have to draw blood.

46:14.165 --> 46:18.328
But too much will lead to disaster.

46:18.438 --> 46:24.668
However, if only taking blood yakuza,
you will be malnourished.

46:25.412 --> 46:27.219
That's why...

46:27.978 --> 46:31.371
Boss conceal the real abilities.

46:34.298 --> 46:35.882
Then...

46:38.238 --> 46:40.505
Why does he bite?

46:40.680 --> 46:43.581
Good question.

46:47.625 --> 46:52.482
I was told to give this to you.

47:20.154 --> 47:24.634
Ah! Now I get it.

47:25.949 --> 47:27.408
Understand what?

47:27.562 --> 47:29.998
This is clearly visible.

47:32.036 --> 47:35.349
You got me.

47:41.244 --> 47:43.365
What does it mean?

47:46.035 --> 47:50.634
This means we do not know anything about it.

47:51.414 --> 47:53.180
When will we know?

47:53.268 --> 47:56.006
It's not something you ask!

47:56.163 --> 48:00.124
For now empty
you like this paper.

48:00.185 --> 48:05.539
You're going to find yourself with your own body.

48:05.784 --> 48:07.233
Myself?

48:07.272 --> 48:11.017
True. There is a reason.

48:11.135 --> 48:17.476
He chose you!
Boss pulsing blood in you.

48:17.564 --> 48:18.857
Dancing tune!

48:19.068 --> 48:21.123
Blood!

48:21.218 --> 48:25.773
You suck! Sip! Sip!

48:27.068 --> 48:28.808
- Are you asleep?
- Sorry!

48:28.883 --> 48:31.277
Fools, find Kageyama!

48:31.407 --> 48:33.385
Basic stupid.

48:39.494 --> 48:41.151

48:45.221 --> 48:46.639
Yes.

49:02.258 --> 49:03.634
Say...

49:04.927 --> 49:06.585
Are you...

49:07.150 --> 49:10.989
Hearing a trickle?

49:11.702 --> 49:13.045
What?

49:22.212 --> 49:23.532
No.

49:23.576 --> 49:26.103
Sounded pretty hard.

49:26.675 --> 49:28.096
What?

49:33.810 --> 49:35.715
Maybe your ears ringing?

49:35.767 --> 49:37.913
Not that.

49:45.784 --> 49:48.790
You're right.
I hear something.

50:11.916 --> 50:13.427
Capt.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.733
It's on your head.

50:15.955 --> 50:17.771
iyakan?

50:31.499 --> 50:33.020
It's me.

50:33.180 --> 50:34.824
Kageyama.

50:36.650 --> 50:38.119
What?

50:39.700 --> 50:41.486
Masaru.

50:42.569 --> 50:45.839
What do you want revenge?

50:46.888 --> 50:48.657
I can not.

50:58.706 --> 51:01.017
You can not?

51:06.762 --> 51:11.646
Thoughts sailing in stormy seas of emotion.

51:26.544 --> 51:30.996
Remove, do not store.

51:31.846 --> 51:36.240
When you're angry at.
Will feel great.

51:49.235 --> 51:51.578
Close your eyes.

52:13.801 --> 52:15.750

52:17.360 --> 52:20.732
You're not a coward like before.

53:08.588 --> 53:11.341
Save your bet.

53:16.940 --> 53:18.420
Bet below.

53:18.505 --> 53:19.386
Parallel.

53:25.326 --> 53:27.180

53:28.757 --> 53:29.937
Go

53:31.651 --> 53:33.452

54:19.491 --> 54:22.319
This menyebalkanku life.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.877
Someone does not necessarily become yakuza.

54:28.984 --> 54:30.497
Then...

54:31.240 --> 54:32.848
How did you become a yakuza?

54:32.930 --> 54:34.250
True

54:34.289 --> 54:37.175
What we take a kind of national exam?

Life is a struggle for survival.

01:01:22.926 --> 01:01:24.979
What...?

01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:26.478
Capt.

01:01:34.663 --> 01:01:36.183
What are you doing?

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.951
Right there.

01:01:42.898 --> 01:01:44.630
A boy?

01:01:47.948 --> 01:01:49.023
Huh?

01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:51.569
Is not that child dead man?

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:54.559
Masaru?

01:01:55.225 --> 01:01:57.655
Time to die.

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:10.177
Way!

01:02:10.302 --> 01:02:10.842
Now!

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:13.447
Run! Run!

01:02:20.878 --> 01:02:21.498
Stop.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:22.858
Stop.

01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:35.993
Kageyama?

01:02:36.546 --> 01:02:38.679
Back!

01:03:37.597 --> 01:03:38.913
Wait!

01:03:40.143 --> 01:03:41.527
What is it?

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:45.613
Again.

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:50.315
dripping head.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.224
Capt.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:55.701
We've got a more pressing problem.

01:03:55.828 --> 01:03:57.394
Reduction civilians.

01:03:57.551 --> 01:04:01.272
Without civilian means no income, and no gang.

01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:05.272
You could say we live off their blood.

01:04:05.778 --> 01:04:06.772
Now?

01:04:06.864 --> 01:04:09.847
They turned into yakuza
and suck blood.

01:04:09.873 --> 01:04:11.821
We must safeguard civilians.

01:04:11.962 --> 01:04:13.220
Right?

01:04:20.567 --> 01:04:21.938
Capt.

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:23.880
What is it?

01:04:43.406 --> 01:04:45.009
No way.

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:47.510
What his brain melt?

01:04:48.407 --> 01:04:50.728
It Kageyama!

01:04:54.247 --> 01:04:55.708
Protect captain!

01:04:55.765 --> 01:04:57.817
Into!

01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:05.013
Protect captain!

01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:21.148
Capt.

01:05:23.432 --> 01:05:25.676
Revenge boss.

01:05:37.219 --> 01:05:38.337
Capt.

01:05:39.307 --> 01:05:40.433
To the car.

01:05:40.616 --> 01:05:42.410
You guys, go!

01:05:48.564 --> 01:05:50.258
Kageyama!

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:53.615
Relax.

01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:56.048
Relax, scoundrel.

01:06:03.094 --> 01:06:05.396
Stop wasting our time.

01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:08.619
Go back to the form that already exists.

01:06:11.311 --> 01:06:12.844
I am a yakuza.

01:06:12.897 --> 01:06:14.537
Show us.

01:06:14.608 --> 01:06:15.523
Or die!

01:06:15.648 --> 01:06:17.412
Fuck that noise!

01:06:19.153 --> 01:06:20.919
As kamiura...

01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:23.929
He's just a piece of junk.

01:06:25.096 --> 01:06:26.352
Asshole!

01:07:44.616 --> 01:07:45.662
Damn!

01:07:57.601 --> 01:07:59.054
No!

01:08:02.542 --> 01:08:03.722
Gosh?

01:08:25.973 --> 01:08:27.828
Dynamite?

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:43.229
your hot bath ready.

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:45.831
your hot bath ready.

01:09:07.997 --> 01:09:11.251
Hey, let's get out of here.

01:09:13.665 --> 01:09:14.988
Hey!

01:09:20.854 --> 01:09:23.317
Why do you interfere?

01:09:24.063 --> 01:09:25.696
I want revenge.

01:09:25.893 --> 01:09:28.863
You're in serious trouble!

01:09:28.961 --> 01:09:30.555
You're lucky I'm here.

01:09:30.774 --> 01:09:33.434
You should thank me.

01:09:45.524 --> 01:09:46.929
You know?

01:09:52.782 --> 01:09:55.753
A great power flowing within me.

01:09:56.645 --> 01:09:58.690
That is not all.

01:09:59.255 --> 01:10:02.045
heal your wounds.

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:05.591
You're taking the power of the boss.

01:10:05.857 --> 01:10:09.898
Later, you will be in complete control
.

01:10:24.565 --> 01:10:26.452
How did he...

01:10:28.293 --> 01:10:31.204
Take my blood...

01:10:31.683 --> 01:10:34.788
And walk down the street...

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:37.324
A vampire yakuza!

01:10:41.945 --> 01:10:44.079
Boss...

01:10:52.871 --> 01:10:54.985
smells like oranges.

01:10:55.810 --> 01:10:57.282
Orange?

01:11:00.869 --> 01:11:02.752
Maybe...

01:11:04.858 --> 01:11:08.274
That means, dear.

01:11:09.752 --> 01:11:11.574
Burn it.

01:11:38.014 --> 01:11:40.439
"Keep daring"

01:11:41.037 --> 01:11:43.295
Fixed desperate?

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.647
I understand now!

01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:47.618
Really?

01:11:47.681 --> 01:11:49.359
You can do it!

01:11:49.385 --> 01:11:50.530
You can!

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.821
Permanent
desperate and you can beat them.

01:12:05.205 --> 01:12:07.295
You want blood.

01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:10.911
Basically...

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:16.251
Do you want my blood?

01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:22.032
Basically...

01:12:43.964 --> 01:12:46.265
No lie when I'm scared.

01:12:50.542 --> 01:12:53.369
Can I do this?

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:00.301
Do not give up.

01:13:07.992 --> 01:13:09.428
Because...

01:13:09.823 --> 01:13:12.799
You want to be the biggest, right?

01:13:13.011 --> 01:13:15.969
A man like a boss.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.547
He will come.

01:14:32.763 --> 01:14:34.854
Finally.

01:15:01.546 --> 01:15:04.199
What here the opening of the store?

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.829
Damn!

01:15:21.928 --> 01:15:22.948
The bastard...

01:15:23.389 --> 01:15:24.982
Almost killed me.

01:15:27.843 --> 01:15:30.344
I want to pay double.

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:32.931
Can I come to your organization, right?

01:15:33.151 --> 01:15:36.583
We have already passed the stage.

01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:39.960
When someone is about to be beheaded...

01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:44.166
Are you worried that if the plate is dry?

01:15:44.258 --> 01:15:46.482
What does that mean?

01:15:49.528 --> 01:15:52.594
What one feels a little excited?

01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:55.397
My plate was a little dry.

01:15:55.512 --> 01:15:57.829
Damn!

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:07.999
What?

01:16:08.117 --> 01:16:09.239
Through here.

01:16:09.337 --> 01:16:11.843
Step carefully.

01:16:19.205 --> 01:16:20.443
Oh...

01:16:20.749 --> 01:16:24.773
Long time no see.

01:16:29.945 --> 01:16:31.545
Wait.

01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:34.529
It was a formidable man?

01:16:34.687 --> 01:16:40.577
modern monster... He's the world's most formidable terrorist
.

01:16:41.572 --> 01:16:44.779
See this.

01:16:44.841 --> 01:16:48.329
This Kamiura blood.

01:16:49.069 --> 01:16:50.242
Actually, I...

01:16:51.354 --> 01:16:52.840
Kill it for you.

01:17:01.223 --> 01:17:02.389
I told you to fast.

01:17:02.943 --> 01:17:05.950
This is it!

01:17:06.014 --> 01:17:08.716
bulging eyes staring at the face!

01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:11.471
Like the frog in the lights?

01:17:13.124 --> 01:17:15.643
He would stare at the car off a cliff.

01:17:15.724 --> 01:17:19.187
gaze of death Kaeru-kun.

01:17:24.032 --> 01:17:27.091
I told them to wait,
but they did not.

01:17:27.723 --> 01:17:30.901
Why do not you calm?

01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:32.523
It.

01:17:33.598 --> 01:17:35.123
It.

01:18:22.195 --> 01:18:23.941
Kaeru-kun...

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.381
Surely yakuza hate.

01:18:28.422 --> 01:18:34.209
What can we command.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:37.487
Please release him.

01:18:42.407 --> 01:18:45.522
Blood yakuza eternal...

01:18:45.882 --> 01:18:49.666
It has been distributed to the other.

01:18:50.018 --> 01:18:54.527
This is the place where you came, Kaeru-kun.

01:18:55.471 --> 01:18:57.378
And he plays...

01:18:57.529 --> 01:18:59.444
In Kamiura.

01:19:06.404 --> 01:19:07.590
Kaeru-kun...

01:19:08.237 --> 01:19:11.163
You're going to take it from here.

01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:12.990
That's enough.

01:19:43.107 --> 01:19:45.093
Damn!

01:19:46.337 --> 01:19:48.637
What the hell is it?

01:19:48.674 --> 01:19:50.819
Cold bone.

01:19:51.356 --> 01:19:53.691
This is nonsense!

01:19:57.716 --> 01:20:00.169
I'll make them pay.

01:20:01.788 --> 01:20:05.448
Do not mess with yakuza Japanese!

01:20:30.376 --> 01:20:31.962
Through here.

01:20:36.713 --> 01:20:40.118
"Gardens Honesty?"

01:20:49.906 --> 01:20:52.341
Captain?

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:02.085
What are you doing?

01:21:02.744 --> 01:21:05.535
Do not step on it!

01:21:06.289 --> 01:21:07.672
On what?

01:21:07.974 --> 01:21:09.866
my plants.

01:21:10.906 --> 01:21:12.217
Plants?

01:21:13.239 --> 01:21:16.116
Move your feet!

01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:21.282
I grow them.

01:21:23.608 --> 01:21:25.591
First...

01:21:25.723 --> 01:21:28.851
Sirami them with milk.

01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:32.857
then kneaded.

01:21:33.173 --> 01:21:35.963
Milk.

01:21:36.234 --> 01:21:38.525
And then...

01:21:39.472 --> 01:21:40.840
See?

01:21:42.547 --> 01:21:45.600
He germinates... germination.

01:21:47.133 --> 01:21:49.606
Quick, quick...

01:21:49.866 --> 01:21:53.527
Healthy and strong.

01:21:53.819 --> 01:21:57.650
We cultivate civilians deserves.

01:21:57.703 --> 01:21:59.320
Harvest!

01:21:59.522 --> 01:22:01.992
A large plants!

01:22:03.994 --> 01:22:06.460
In this way...

01:22:06.634 --> 01:22:10.276
We can drink the blood of the living.

01:22:12.002 --> 01:22:14.574
Without civilians...

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:19.126
Yakuza can not survive.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.627
Know what I think?

01:22:22.708 --> 01:22:23.881
Uh...

01:22:27.368 --> 01:22:29.803
I mean, what's in my mind.

01:23:00.472 --> 01:23:02.021
Boss.

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:05.040
Look at me now.

01:23:09.741 --> 01:23:12.720
Where Aratetsu and Angus...

01:23:12.977 --> 01:23:16.239
On a busy time like this.

01:23:18.132 --> 01:23:19.454
Captain!

01:23:39.896 --> 01:23:42.275
bastard.

01:23:45.728 --> 01:23:49.620
I control garden civilians.

01:23:52.212 --> 01:23:54.527
You no longer used!

01:23:55.493 --> 01:23:57.965
Death!

01:24:36.079 --> 01:24:37.803
What is it?

01:24:39.409 --> 01:24:42.349
Hold... Hold there!

01:24:42.596 --> 01:24:44.274
Do not drive like ..

01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:52.450
This is not good!

01:24:56.438 --> 01:24:58.953
It's really not good!

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.923
You do, huh?

01:25:54.391 --> 01:25:56.918
Not so fast.

01:25:58.296 --> 01:26:00.040
Child.

01:26:00.784 --> 01:26:03.091
There was something he had to do.

01:26:17.326 --> 01:26:20.527
Masaru, can you handle it?

01:26:53.954 --> 01:26:55.440
You...

01:26:57.047 --> 01:27:00.346
What do you know about me?

01:28:04.132 --> 01:28:06.040
Glory to wait.

01:28:11.438 --> 01:28:13.418
Here I am not the boss.

01:28:18.876 --> 01:28:41.710
<Font color = # 80FF00>
wood WIO Kendari, October 11, 2015.

01:29:58.404 --> 01:29:59.510
Angus!

01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:00.573
Yes!

01:30:35.508 --> 01:30:38.126
Angus! Run!

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.699
Flatten bastards!

01:30:57.961 --> 01:31:00.931
creamed him like a little animal!

01:31:52.027 --> 01:31:54.280
Basic droppings rot.

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:20.943
Damn! Angus!

01:32:37.448 --> 01:32:40.655
Angus. Are you okay?

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:17.433
Sometimes yakuza wild.

01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:20.418
Right!

01:33:22.184 --> 01:33:27.093
Kageyama! Yakuza great.
Know why?

01:33:27.855 --> 01:33:30.625
We do not care about winning or losing.

01:33:30.665 --> 01:33:33.053
We just fight!

01:33:43.583 --> 01:33:46.814
Kageyama, I'll take care of it.

01:33:48.181 --> 01:33:49.971
Do not mess it up.

01:33:51.675 --> 01:33:52.952
See you later.

01:33:53.923 --> 01:33:55.674
OK.

01:34:21.542 --> 01:34:23.055
Really?

01:34:34.828 --> 01:34:38.469
Angus, go help your brother.

01:34:39.664 --> 01:34:41.028
Yes, sir.

01:35:26.770 --> 01:35:29.805
Damn! Not good!

01:35:29.994 --> 01:35:31.927
You motherfucker.
You do not know your fate.

01:35:31.977 --> 01:35:33.599
You're all stupid.

01:35:33.776 --> 01:35:36.841
yakuza Saying stupid and you do not have anything else!

01:35:39.153 --> 01:35:43.954
Will I pull your head and apologize to the boss with it.

01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:55.266
That hurts.
Damn bastard.

01:36:43.557 --> 01:36:45.245
Brother!

01:36:59.728 --> 01:37:01.445
Brother...

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:15.707
Angus!

01:41:20.744 --> 01:41:22.438
What happened?

01:41:22.714 --> 01:41:26.127
What happened to the world?

01:41:59.355 --> 01:42:02.239
World will come to one person,
however.

01:42:03.693 --> 01:42:05.247
He's bet.

01:42:05.579 --> 01:42:07.505
I would like to clarify...

01:42:07.573 --> 01:42:09.737
Who is the real winner.

01:42:11.541 --> 01:42:13.907
The fight one on one.

01:42:15.249 --> 01:42:17.412
You're going to lose for it.

01:42:17.593 --> 01:42:18.806
iyakan?

01:42:21.212 --> 01:42:23.121
Come here.

01:42:24.745 --> 01:42:26.328
For you know...

01:42:27.221 --> 01:42:29.123
I'm going to pull your life...

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:32.120
If I want to do.

01:42:35.156 --> 01:42:36.857
It makes my blood boil.

01:42:36.996 --> 01:42:38.576
Wait.

01:42:43.283 --> 01:42:44.546
Kyoko?

01:42:46.518 --> 01:42:49.468
You're not going to win like that.

01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:55.538
Watch and see.

01:42:57.122 --> 01:42:59.488
I'm going to win.

01:43:16.168 --> 01:43:20.373
You know why I'm here, right?

01:43:24.375 --> 01:43:26.367
Drink my blood.

01:43:38.976 --> 01:43:41.545
Save the world.
