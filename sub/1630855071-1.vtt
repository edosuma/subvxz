I want you to go and see
that fucking degenerate cowboy

18:32.947 --> 18:35.648
and see if you can straighten
this fucking out, all right?

18:35.683 --> 18:38.650
Who knows? Maybe it's all
for the best.

18:38.685 --> 18:42.191
- You did the right thing.
- What?

18:42.227 --> 18:43.696
You did the right thing,
I'm saying,

18:43.731 --> 18:45.826
having the guy clipped.

18:45.861 --> 18:48.728
He owed you 100 grand
for six weeks.
You did the right thing.

18:48.763 --> 18:50.532
Are you being
a fucking wise ass
right now?

18:50.568 --> 18:54.274
- Are you fucking with me, dom?
- What do you mean?

18:54.309 --> 18:56.347
What do I mean?
What do you mean,
what the fuck do I mean?

18:56.371 --> 18:59.846
It didn't fucking work.
It didn't work. What do you
mean, "I had him clipped"?

18:59.881 --> 19:01.344
- I'm just saying.
- Don't say.

19:01.380 --> 19:03.475
I don't want you
to fucking say,
all right? Do!

19:03.511 --> 19:04.910
I don't want you to fucking say.

19:04.946 --> 19:07.679
In retrospect, I would like
to have my hundred stacks,

19:07.715 --> 19:10.685
- if that's okay with you.
- I got it.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.559
Good. Now, tomorrow
first thing,
you go out there

19:14.594 --> 19:17.225
and you take care
of this fucking thing
with this cowboy.

19:17.261 --> 19:18.627
Hopefully, with some success,

19:18.662 --> 19:22.694
and then I want you to find
that fucking cunt Jackie

19:22.730 --> 19:25.771

to bring him to me directly.

19:25.806 --> 19:27.438

19:28.604 --> 19:30.471
- Yeah, yeah. We're clear.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:37.745 --> 19:40.853

19:40.889 --> 19:42.253

19:42.289 --> 19:44.255
- What are you doing?
- Why are you hiding?

19:44.290 --> 19:45.862
No one knows that I work
at that fucking diner.

- Oh, discreet!

19:47.757 --> 19:50.562
And pertaining to the others
of concern, one's dead

19:50.597 --> 19:52.572
and for all we know,
the other might have
killed him, okay?

19:52.596 --> 19:54.363

- Just relax.
Oh, don't shush me!

- No, no, no.

This is my mom's house.
She's rich.

20:06.312 --> 20:08.112
Truth be told,
her ex-husbands are rich.

20:08.147 --> 20:10.008
- She's just lucky.
- Uh-huh.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.954

ex-husbands with an "s"?

20:14.990 --> 20:17.287
All four of them.
Rich and dead.

some of the money

my mortgage.

You gonna say anything

nodding your head like that?

21:09.043 --> 21:11.271
Okay, why are we
getting married?

21:11.306 --> 21:14.345
Because...

21:14.380 --> 21:16.943
It's the sole condition
of my mother's will.

21:18.386 --> 21:21.014
- I'm not killing your mother.
- I appreciate that.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.348

to kill my mom.

21:23.384 --> 21:24.853
Okay.

21:24.888 --> 21:26.999
If we can lead her to believe
that we are getting married,

21:27.023 --> 21:29.166
the idea would be
that she would advance me
some of the money

21:29.190 --> 21:32.398
that I'd be getting
after she died,
but before she dies.

21:32.433 --> 21:35.161
- I'm sorry,
but that's ridiculous.
- No, Jackie.

21:35.196 --> 21:38.170
What's ridiculous is
that you probably killed
someone this morning,

21:38.206 --> 21:40.238
and then you kidnapped me,
or you tried to,

21:40.274 --> 21:42.504

Einstein?

21:45.777 --> 21:49.974
Okay, look. My son's detention
hearing is in three days.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.649
That's a day
that will basically determine

21:51.680 --> 21:53.383
how the rest
of his life plays out.

29:55.863 --> 29:57.535
The black widow.

29:57.570 --> 29:59.004
That's right.
She did tell me.

Mm.

Four dead husbands
within a year

30:03.336 --> 30:05.270
I can only assume
I earned that title

30:05.305 --> 30:09.106
because when the black widow
reproduces,

30:09.141 --> 30:11.412
she often kills her mate,

30:11.448 --> 30:15.114
but that's ridiculous
because I didn't mate
with any of them.

30:15.150 --> 30:17.755
This one's father
got away somehow.

30:17.790 --> 30:20.318
- Lucky, lucky.
- Now you tell me...

30:20.353 --> 30:24.589
Is it because I kill
people when I bite?

30:25.864 --> 30:28.359
Because when they die,
I wear black?

30:28.395 --> 30:32.031
Or could it be that I have
a red birthmark

30:32.067 --> 30:34.432

to outlive their mates.

30:46.615 --> 30:47.984

30:48.019 --> 30:53.154
It's because she's focused
on what she wants.

30:53.189 --> 30:56.957
And nobody or nothing
is gonna get in her way.

30:56.993 --> 31:00.900

<i>I'm Kenny Walsh...</i>

31:45.612 --> 31:48.176
And Kenny Walsh loves the kids.

31:48.211 --> 31:49.552
<i>Are you gonna help me, mom?</i>

31:49.576 --> 31:52.714
<i>So, what do you
want me to do, Billy?</i>

31:52.750 --> 31:54.151
Get me out of here.

31:54.186 --> 31:56.883
Oh, okay. Well, and how do you
expect that I do that?

31:56.918 --> 31:58.652
<i>Tell me. Tell me.</i>

31:58.687 --> 32:01.593
I don't know. I don't know,
but I'm freaking out,
i'm, uh...

32:01.628 --> 32:03.093
<i>I was talking to my counselor</i>

32:03.128 --> 32:05.792
<i>and he was saying
I could even end up in prison...</i>

32:05.828 --> 32:07.995
Uh-oh! Uh-oh.

32:08.030 --> 32:09.528
Yeah, that's not good. Yeah.

32:09.564 --> 32:11.836
Well, maybe you should've
thought about that one

32:11.871 --> 32:14.666
before you kidnapped
another child.

32:14.702 --> 32:18.943
I did not fucking
kidnap anyone, mom.
I told you.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.410
I showed up at Chad's,
and the kid was there.

32:21.445 --> 32:23.815
Yeah, and what did I tell you
about the last fucking time

32:23.850 --> 32:25.517
that you hung out
with fucking Chad?

32:25.552 --> 32:26.851
<i>- Huh?</i>
- You're right.

32:26.886 --> 32:28.920
I'll never go
to Chad's ever again.

32:28.956 --> 32:32.183
Yo, hurry up, man.
I need to make
a phone call.

32:32.219 --> 32:34.455
One sec.
It's my girl.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.324
- Are you gonna get me a lawyer?
- You know what?

32:38.359 --> 32:39.997
I've been spending
every fucking day

32:40.033 --> 32:42.330
looking for a fucking lawyer
for you, Billy.

32:42.365 --> 32:46.236
I can't even afford to feed
myself, all right?

32:46.271 --> 32:49.173
Yo, hurry up, man.
You didn't hear me
the first time?

32:49.208 --> 32:52.308
- I need to make a phone call.
- Yeah. Connection.

32:54.408 --> 32:56.080
Are you gonna come
see me tomorrow?

32:56.116 --> 32:58.479
I'm gonna do the best
I fucking can, all right?

33:00.019 --> 33:03.251
I'm sorry, man.
I just got off the phone.

33:03.287 --> 33:05.783
- I told you that
two times ago.
- Yeah.

33:14.866 --> 33:17.499
Hey, mama. How you doing?

33:17.535 --> 33:19.671
♪

33:19.706 --> 33:21.733
I think that's my last crab.

33:27.441 --> 33:30.309
So how about that cigarette,
Jackie boy?

33:30.344 --> 33:31.510
You know what, mom?
Forget it.

33:31.545 --> 33:33.285
I knew I shouldn't have
come back here.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.117
God forbid I need
anything from anyone,
let alone my own mother.

33:36.153 --> 33:39.021
Oh, the drama of it all!

33:39.056 --> 33:41.425
You should've been a thespian.

33:41.460 --> 33:44.162
If you weren't dying,
I'd say something horrible
right now.

33:44.197 --> 33:47.030
Yeah, well, if I wasn't dying,
maybe I'd give a shit.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.900
- Okay, you want the truth?
- Jackie.

33:49.935 --> 33:51.530
- That's my favorite.
- Great.

33:51.565 --> 33:55.102
My 15-year-old son
was arrested last week

33:55.138 --> 33:56.370
for something he did not do.

33:56.406 --> 33:59.069
It's a serious charge,
and he needs a lawyer.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.977
Your daughter and I have not
known each other for very long,
okay?

34:02.012 --> 34:03.446
But she is, without question,

34:03.481 --> 34:06.116
the most interesting human being
I have ever met in my life.

34:06.151 --> 34:08.879
I love her and I want
to marry her, okay?

34:08.914 --> 34:11.924
But the truth right now,
we need that money for a lawyer

34:11.958 --> 34:13.679
so we can get my kid
out of jail, all right?

34:17.628 --> 34:23.400
- Well, I thank you for your honesty.
- - Thank you.

34:23.436 --> 34:27.063
- But why don't you
just bail him out?
- There is no bail.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.467
Uh, in the juvenile system,
there's no bail.
It's different.

34:29.503 --> 34:32.375
I need to get him out,
like, now.

34:33.342 --> 34:36.507
So how much
does this lawyer cost?

34:36.543 --> 34:39.208
Uh... I'm guessing
like $25,000?

34:39.245 --> 34:40.678
You're guessing?

34:40.713 --> 34:43.382
I will know the second
I secure the lawyer.

34:43.418 --> 34:46.222
Well, you do that,
and when you come back,

34:46.257 --> 34:48.619
- I will write you a check.
- Oh, thank you.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.761
Unless, of course,
I change my mind.

34:50.795 --> 34:52.494
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

34:53.862 --> 34:55.596
Wait.

34:58.603 --> 34:59.633
Oh!

35:00.402 --> 35:02.774
- I love you, son.
- I love you too.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.368
I love the both of you
very much.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.778
Oh, god.
He's a keeper.

35:06.814 --> 35:09.148
That means a lot
coming from you.

35:10.551 --> 35:11.876
Tsk. All right.

35:14.385 --> 35:17.621
I'm sorry I can't give you
any money right now.

35:17.657 --> 35:18.617
I will, however,

35:18.652 --> 35:21.022
put up the money
for your soon-to-be stepson,

35:21.057 --> 35:22.422
because, for some reason,

35:22.457 --> 35:23.922
it seems like
the right thing to do

35:23.957 --> 35:27.758
but beyond that, my instincts
are telling me otherwise.

35:27.793 --> 35:31.335
I know we don't understand
each other, Lola.

35:32.639 --> 35:34.838
We never did.

35:34.873 --> 35:37.874
But if you could accept

35:37.909 --> 35:39.508
the things that I do...

35:40.814 --> 35:43.479
That even I can't explain...

35:44.983 --> 35:47.684
That would be my final wish.

35:47.720 --> 35:48.946
Can you do that?

35:51.184 --> 35:53.423
I can try.

35:56.259 --> 35:58.161
She's known you for two minutes!

35:58.197 --> 36:00.427
Crab legs,
a sappy abridged monologue,

36:00.463 --> 36:02.127
and she's ready
to write you a check?

36:02.163 --> 36:06.101
Do you know how many times
I've asked her for money
over the years?

36:06.137 --> 36:07.833
- I can imagine.
- My whole life.

36:07.868 --> 36:11.408
My whole fucking life,
she's treated me like shit.

36:11.443 --> 36:13.975
"I'm talented, mom.
I'm really good at what I do.

36:14.011 --> 36:18.079
All I need is a plane ticket
to New York City,
and a little bit of cash."

36:18.114 --> 36:20.719
Nope. Fuck off, darling.

36:20.754 --> 36:23.714
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- What are you sorry for?
You got what you wanted.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.885
Bravo. You should've been
the actor.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.722
Look, you deserve better,
period, okay?
But so does my kid.

36:29.757 --> 36:31.930
I know you're upset right now,
but I'm begging you,

36:31.966 --> 36:34.365
please, please stick
with me on this.

36:37.634 --> 36:40.569
I also want you to know I meant
what I said back there.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.438
Which part?

36:46.473 --> 36:47.871
I really gotta get to a phone.

36:47.907 --> 36:50.348
I'm sorry, but I gotta...
I gotta get to a phone.

37:05.263 --> 37:07.524
What the fuck
do these people do?

37:07.560 --> 37:10.132
She blows rich guys.

37:10.168 --> 37:11.762
It's the girl's mother's house.

37:11.797 --> 37:14.900
I'm out here
all fucking day.
Nothing.

37:15.936 --> 37:18.637
You really think Walter
is gonna go to the police?

37:18.673 --> 37:21.241
I can't be
too fucking sure,
can I?

37:21.276 --> 37:24.261
But what I can be 100% fucking
sure is that I don't want
to fucking find out.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.450
My uncle back fucking home
with the rico charges,

37:26.486 --> 37:28.716
all I need now is to face
a fucking murder rap, okay?

37:28.751 --> 37:31.785
So do me a fucking favor,
and find fucking Jackie

37:31.820 --> 37:34.953
and make him understand,
make him fucking understand,

37:34.988 --> 37:37.357
I need him to turn himself in,
and if he does that,

37:37.393 --> 37:39.458
when he gets out
of fucking jail,

37:39.493 --> 37:40.827
if he gets out of fucking jail,

37:40.962 --> 37:44.600
we're gonna take care
of him, okay?
Do that for me.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.340
- What about the kid?
- Fuck the kid, okay?

37:51.375 --> 37:53.774
- That ship sailed.
- What the fuck?

37:59.447 --> 38:00.680
- Go, go, go!
- What?

38:00.716 --> 38:02.293
- Gun it! Go straight!
- What are you doing?

38:02.317 --> 38:04.455
Gun it! Go! Go! Go! Go!

38:05.221 --> 38:07.818
This is a fucking bust.

38:07.854 --> 38:10.087
I need to get back
to my fucking life.

38:10.122 --> 38:13.832
I think I got an idea
where he might be headed next.

38:13.867 --> 38:17.736
Now you're talking, dom.
Now, go follow that idea
and fucking make him understand.

38:17.771 --> 38:20.669
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:22.738 --> 38:24.518
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go up,
I'm gonna see Walter.

38:24.542 --> 38:27.040
I'm gonna take care
of this bullshit by myself.

38:27.075 --> 38:30.378
Careful.
That fucking hillbilly's
ready for war over there.

38:30.413 --> 38:32.282
I'm gonna come in peace,
obviously.

38:32.318 --> 38:33.859
- It's gonna be
fucking amazing.
- Right.

38:33.883 --> 38:36.346
You believe this shit?
I gotta go beg
for fucking money?

38:36.382 --> 38:40.019
I gotta go beg
for my fucking money? Anybody at
home hears about this,

38:40.054 --> 38:42.131
they're like, "wait,
what the fuck happened
to pauly?"

38:42.155 --> 38:45.597
"I don't know.
He moved out to Oklahoma
and became a cunt."

38:45.632 --> 38:46.761
Fuck.

38:49.096 --> 38:51.733
Jesus Christ, Taylor.
What are you,
on dial-up here?

38:51.768 --> 38:53.732
If you don't like my shit,
then go somewhere else.

38:53.768 --> 38:55.833
In fact, you should
just go elsewhere

38:55.868 --> 38:57.317
and you should take
this whore with you.

38:57.341 --> 38:58.939
- Excuse me?
- Please, Taylor?

38:58.974 --> 39:01.411
This is a family matter.
I don't know
what you're doing here.

39:01.446 --> 39:03.378
Call me a whore again
and see what happens.

39:03.413 --> 39:05.009
- And who are you?
- A friend.

39:05.044 --> 39:06.946
That's weird. Jackie
doesn't have any friends.

39:06.981 --> 39:09.213
- Can you please, Taylor?
- You want to know why?

39:09.248 --> 39:11.948
- I don't.
- It's because he's
a really big asshole.

39:11.984 --> 39:15.691
- A big, gaping asshole.
- Lovely. Lovely.

39:15.726 --> 39:17.888
- Would you like some advice?
- I definitely don't.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.495
Well, what I think
you should do is,

39:19.530 --> 39:21.695
you should run
and run as fast as you can.

39:21.731 --> 39:23.733
And if you're pregnant already,
then make a left

39:23.768 --> 39:26.108
- and go straight to the clinic.
- All right, that's enough.

39:26.132 --> 39:28.736
I can see that your life's
shit here, and I'd rather not,

39:28.772 --> 39:30.850
but keep it up, and I'll knock
your fucking teeth in.

39:30.874 --> 39:33.303
- Is that a threat?
- What the fuck else
would it be?

39:33.338 --> 39:36.640
Hey, uh, Mr. Walsh,
my-my name is Jackie powers,
okay?

39:36.675 --> 39:38.543
My son is Billy powers.

39:38.579 --> 39:41.431
He's currently at haskell
awaiting a detention hearing,
which is in two days.

39:41.455 --> 39:43.263
Please call me back
at your earliest convenience.

39:43.287 --> 39:47.452
My number is 918-793-1248.

39:47.488 --> 39:48.955
Thank you very much.

39:50.723 --> 39:52.561
Why did you give my number?

39:52.596 --> 39:55.865
- Oh, my god.
- It's for your son, Taylor.

39:55.900 --> 39:57.631
Okay.

39:57.666 --> 39:59.698
Ahem.

39:59.734 --> 40:01.968
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

40:05.779 --> 40:08.244
Oh, fuck.

40:08.279 --> 40:10.113
Fuck, fuck. Back door, now.

40:10.148 --> 40:12.153
Let's go. Out, out, out.
Back door. Let's go, let's go.
Let's go. We gotta go.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.615
- What are you talking about?
- Now, now, now.

40:14.651 --> 40:15.959
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- What?

40:15.983 --> 40:18.885
- That is dom, okay?
Please...
- Oh. What?

40:18.921 --> 40:21.822
If you mention
that you've seen me,
Billy is fucked.

40:21.857 --> 40:23.822
Do the right thing.
Don't fuck with me,
Taylor.

40:23.857 --> 40:25.355
Don't fuck with me.
Do the right thing

40:25.391 --> 40:29.096
and give me your word
you will not mention
that you've seen me.

40:29.132 --> 40:31.197
Okay. Go.

40:31.233 --> 40:34.231
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

40:36.871 --> 40:40.042
- Who is it?
- It's the police.

40:40.077 --> 40:41.480
Yeah, right.

40:45.148 --> 40:46.243
Where is he?

40:47.215 --> 40:48.350
Who?

40:48.386 --> 40:52.022
Come on, don't be cute.
Jackie.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.017
I haven't seen him.

40:57.095 --> 40:58.492
What was that?

40:58.528 --> 40:59.794
All right, it was him, okay?

40:59.829 --> 41:02.330
But I really have no idea
where he was going.

41:02.365 --> 41:04.600
Why don't I believe you?

41:04.635 --> 41:06.348
Because you're a fucking
asshole, that's why.

41:06.372 --> 41:08.606
All right, Taylor,
with the bullshit.

41:09.638 --> 41:11.169
All right,
you're just gonna leave?

41:18.747 --> 41:20.746
Yeah, I didn't come
here for that.

41:20.781 --> 41:22.650
You know what your problem is?

41:22.685 --> 41:24.853
You treat me
like shit for a reason.

41:24.888 --> 41:26.888
No, I treat you like shit
because you're an asshole

41:26.920 --> 41:28.758
and you deserve it
most of the time.

41:28.793 --> 41:31.423
No, you're still mad
that I chose Jackie
and not you.

41:31.459 --> 41:33.565
Chose Jackie?

41:33.600 --> 41:36.194
You didn't choose shit.
Look at this fucking place.

41:36.229 --> 41:39.235
I'll tell you why
you ended up with Jackie
and not me.

41:39.271 --> 41:41.570
It's real fucking simple.

41:41.605 --> 41:44.239
You made a mistake.

41:44.274 --> 41:45.443
It's no big deal,

41:45.478 --> 41:48.172
but don't treat me
like I'm the bad guy.

41:48.207 --> 41:50.307
You want me to stay
and throw a fuck in you...

41:51.711 --> 41:53.684
Just tell me to stay.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.928
Always gotta be
a fucking thing
with this one.

42:05.964 --> 42:08.996
♪

42:24.076 --> 42:26.310
They were all out of crab legs.

42:37.126 --> 42:40.031
I just can't believe
you had a child
with that woman.

20 years ago.

to see your son tomorrow?

43:15.032 --> 43:17.008
- They... they will.
- We have
different last names.

Right. Do you know
how many kids in that place

with the same last names?
None of them.

43:22.404 --> 43:24.982

someone's mother to visit
is, like, a thing?

43:25.006 --> 43:27.344
- It's not.
- How do you know, though?

43:27.379 --> 43:28.977

this game?

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:06.237
- Yeah.
- Kidnapping.

01:10:07.107 --> 01:10:09.805
Right. Again, I'm not here
to speak on what
those other children did,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.041
but my client,
he showed up after the fact

01:10:12.076 --> 01:10:15.543
and he had no idea
what was going on
until after he arrived.

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:16.845
Well, why didn't he leave?

01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:19.149
I can't answer
that question,
your honor,

01:10:19.185 --> 01:10:23.485
and I'm not implying
that that question
doesn't need to be answered.

01:10:23.521 --> 01:10:26.421
He's a good kid.
No priors.

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:29.792
I mean, aside from not making
the right decision
to leave immediately,

01:10:29.827 --> 01:10:31.895
and, of course,
the drinking and smoking,

01:10:31.931 --> 01:10:35.467
the only thing Billy powers
is guilty of is bad taste.

01:10:35.502 --> 01:10:36.777
I believe
that he should be allowed

01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:39.101
to stay with his mother
while awaiting trial.

01:10:39.136 --> 01:10:42.171
Of course, with the court's
recommendation for monitoring.

01:10:42.206 --> 01:10:45.510
Well, that leads me
to my next question.
Where is the mother?

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:48.115
- I'm here, your honor.
- She's here.

01:10:48.151 --> 01:10:49.781
Ma'am, come up here, please.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.594
I'm looking at a report,
ma'am, that says
that law enforcement

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:03.297
attempted to make
several calls
to your residence.

01:11:03.332 --> 01:11:05.429
Those phone calls
were never answered.

01:11:05.464 --> 01:11:11.073
There's also indication
that the probation office
did as well, yet no call back?

01:11:11.109 --> 01:11:14.606
No attempt by you
to contact anyone?

01:11:14.642 --> 01:11:18.277
I cannot release your son
into your custody

01:11:18.313 --> 01:11:20.548
without a reasonable
explanation.

01:11:28.056 --> 01:11:29.953

In a horrible boating accident
back in 2015.

01:11:43.534 --> 01:11:45.738
Billy was just a boy.

01:11:46.805 --> 01:11:49.878
When I received the messages,
i, uh...

01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:51.281
I did some research,

01:11:51.316 --> 01:11:53.516
and upon learning
the severity of the charges,

01:11:53.552 --> 01:11:57.816
I just broke down
and I couldn't find
the will to get back up.

01:11:59.488 --> 01:12:02.120
I knew we couldn't afford
an attorney.

01:12:03.826 --> 01:12:07.123

and I reached out
to Mr. Hunter here,

01:12:18.036 --> 01:12:20.006
and he told me that Billy
was in a lot of trouble,

01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:24.540
but at the same time,
he wasn't gonna stand
for this injustice.

01:12:24.576 --> 01:12:27.076

of his heart...

free of charge.
