WEBVTT

00:10.880 --> 00:14.440
<i>Nole! Nole! Nole!</i>

00:17.480 --> 00:20.760
-Nole! Nole!
-Free Novak!

00:20.840 --> 00:23.280
We want to see him play tennis!

00:23.360 --> 00:26.000
Nole! Nole! Nole!

00:31.160 --> 00:33.400
Novak Djokovic's supporters…

00:33.480 --> 00:36.520
They've been protesting for days now,

00:36.600 --> 00:39.600
calling on the government
to allow Novak Djokovic

00:39.680 --> 00:43.680
to take part in the Australian Open
and defend his title.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.680
This is a world-famous athlete
that was public

00:46.760 --> 00:48.640
about not wanting to get the vaccine.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.760
But his legal team want to fight that
decision to cancel Novak Djokovic's visa.

00:53.840 --> 00:58.200
This injustice must be overturned!

00:58.280 --> 00:59.080
SERBIA

00:59.160 --> 01:00.560
Nole! Nole!

01:00.640 --> 01:04.880
Novak Djokovic remains in this detention
facility that you can see behind me.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.720
Federal politicians
are still weighing in in this debate,

01:07.800 --> 01:10.560
but undoubtedly the world's eyes
are on this court case.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.800
We don't know what the government
is gonna do next, but we'll see.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.000
Is there still a chance?

01:21.080 --> 01:24.560
This is live.
This morning, they're making a decision.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.840
-Today?
-Yeah.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.320
Nole! Nole! Nole!

01:35.760 --> 01:39.320
Breaking news in the last few minutes,
huge developments down here in Melbourne.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.320
The world number one's visa
has been canceled.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.320
Novak Djokovic's Australian visa
has now been canceled.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.640
Novak Djokovic
has left Australia.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.040
…sent home
after refusing to be vaccinated.

01:52.120 --> 01:56.600
<i>He will now miss his chance</i>
<i>to win a tenth Australian Open title.</i>

01:58.320 --> 02:00.200
I'm sorry. Just one second.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.200
He's out.
Oh, my God, this is fucking bonkers.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.200
They canceled his visa.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.800
Well, I mean, there's one less person
to worry about.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.280
<i>The last few days</i>
<i>have seen some outrageous tennis.</i>

02:33.160 --> 02:35.480
Game, set, match.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.240
<i>Sakkari finishes with a flourish.</i>

02:41.320 --> 02:42.440
Whoo!

02:43.160 --> 02:44.440
Yes!

02:53.280 --> 02:57.200
<i>Game, set,</i>
<i>and match for Félix Auger-Aliassime.</i>

02:59.120 --> 03:01.240
<i>And American Taylor Fritz</i>

03:01.320 --> 03:04.440
<i>books himself a spot in the next round.</i>

03:04.520 --> 03:07.280
Match point, Frances Tiafoe.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.200
<i>Local boy Nick Kyrgios</i>

03:15.280 --> 03:17.600
<i>crashed out to Medvedev</i>
<i>in the second round.</i>

03:19.520 --> 03:23.640
<i>But a lot of these next generation</i>
<i>guys look like they mean business.</i>

03:25.080 --> 03:26.960
Yeah!

03:27.040 --> 03:29.040
I'm fucking hyped up, man.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.680
<i>For the first time in ages,</i>
<i>the greatest players of all time,</i>

03:37.760 --> 03:40.440
<i>who have dominated</i>
<i>this tournament for decades,</i>

03:40.520 --> 03:43.160
<i>are no longer standing in their way.</i>

03:43.760 --> 03:45.720
-Good luck.
-Clear the way please.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.040
This year in Australia
it's a massive opportunity.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.200
Serena Williams isn't in the draw.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.280
Roger Federer can't play due to injury.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.120
Rafael Nadal hasn't played tennis
in five or six months,

04:01.200 --> 04:03.800
so a lot of question marks
surrounding him.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.880
Challenging time for me,
the last year and a half, with my foot.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.520
I've been suffering a lot.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.840
And with Novak Djokovic not in the draw,

04:14.120 --> 04:16.440
it's a great opportunity
for some younger players

04:16.520 --> 04:19.040
to bag a slam for the first time.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.760
This new guard,

04:21.839 --> 04:25.440
to wake up and to know that
you have the chance to win a Grand Slam.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.440
That's a lot. But it's pretty exciting.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.320
<i>The draw is wide open.</i>
<i>But to me the strongest contender</i>

04:36.400 --> 04:39.440
<i>is the Italian, Matteo Berrettini.</i>

04:39.520 --> 04:42.520
<i>Let's face it.</i>
<i>He's due to win a Slam, right?</i>

04:47.040 --> 04:49.600
<i>I've come so close to being a champion.</i>

04:53.600 --> 04:56.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you please take your seats

04:56.120 --> 04:59.560
for the Wimbledon
gentlemen's singles final.

04:59.640 --> 05:03.120
Novak Djokovic versus Matteo Berrettini.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.360
<i>So far, it was</i>
<i>the biggest moment of my career.</i>

05:18.880 --> 05:20.400
<i>It's in.</i>

05:20.480 --> 05:22.320
<i>First set goes to Berrettini.</i>

05:23.920 --> 05:27.520
<i>If it wasn't for Novak,</i>
<i>maybe I would have had a slam already.</i>

05:35.040 --> 05:37.440
<i>A sixth Wimbledon title</i>

05:38.640 --> 05:41.520
<i>for the Serbian superstar.</i>

05:44.320 --> 05:47.960
<i>That loss was really hard,</i>
<i>but it taught me so much.</i>

05:49.680 --> 05:51.200
<i>Now, it's my time.</i>

05:52.240 --> 05:56.120
From Italy,
the seventh seed, Matteo Berrettini.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.880
<i>Well, this man</i>
<i>is the most tenacious of competitors.</i>

06:07.400 --> 06:09.760
<i>Huge serving from Berrettini.</i>

06:09.840 --> 06:11.480
<i>"The hammer," as he's called.</i>

06:13.400 --> 06:15.920
<i>Magical stuff there from Berrettini.</i>

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
<i>This guy has got so much game.</i>

06:20.280 --> 06:22.520
Matteo feels his time is now.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.760
There are very few players on this planet

06:24.840 --> 06:27.120
that want to see him
near them in the draw.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.800
Last year, the only players to beat him

06:30.880 --> 06:33.640
were Novak and Rafa,
which I think says a lot.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.880
I have pretty good weapons.
Like my serve, my forehand are dangerous.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.240
Once he gets
hold of you with that forehand,

06:43.320 --> 06:45.160
once he's got his teeth into you,

06:45.240 --> 06:48.760
and has the pattern that he wants,
it's really hard to get out of jail.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.480
I try to make them run.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.640
And I run as little as possible.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.240
But the best part, I think, is my mindset.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.280
When there are tough moments,
I'm a great fighter.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.080
Game, set and match for Berrettini.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.120
<i>Matteo Berrettini</i>
<i>is a player that's on the up and up.</i>

07:30.240 --> 07:35.240
<i>And he has a sense of history</i>
<i>and a sense of what his legacy can be.</i>

07:40.160 --> 07:41.360
This sport, man.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.640
Crazy.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.480
It's something,
something weird for me.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.440
Thanks, man.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.280
Because I remember my first big Slam.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.440
They were like,
"Who the hell is this guy?"

08:07.040 --> 08:09.080
Shall I cut up some more?

08:09.160 --> 08:11.160
It's really good Parmesan, isn't it?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.120
It has, like, a kilo of Parmesan.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.000
Tastes like home, huh?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.160
I'm so sorry
you aren't living here in Rome.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.440
-Have you been playing recently, Grandpa?
-Last week he played every day.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.320
That was an excuse to see my girlfriend.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.760
Tennis is in my DNA
because my whole family plays.

08:37.360 --> 08:43.080
But I wasn't supposed to become
this, like, top-ten tennis player.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.880
I wasn't that good.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.080
I didn't have a lot of strength.
I was just tall and skinny.

08:49.159 --> 08:51.080
Like a giraffe or something.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.160
My parents were scared that
I couldn't make a living with tennis,

08:56.240 --> 08:59.120
and obviously we're not, like, rich.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.120
They were like,
"Are you sure you want to do this?"

09:02.200 --> 09:04.840
I remember telling them,
"Yeah, I want to do this."

09:06.720 --> 09:09.640
What they told me is,
"The only thing we want is that

09:09.720 --> 09:11.880
you put 100% in what you're doing."

09:12.600 --> 09:15.200
So it means that when I step in the court,

09:15.280 --> 09:17.960
I push myself to the limit every time.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.720
What do you think about the coming season?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.520
-Kick ass.
-Kick ass.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.520
I feel like now is the time

09:29.600 --> 09:32.840
when I can get the big result.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.040
True.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.600
<i>It's getting up</i>
<i>to 35 degrees here in Melbourne.</i>

09:44.680 --> 09:47.280
<i>The women's side of the draw</i>
<i>is starting to hot up.</i>

09:49.520 --> 09:52.320
If you're a top-ten player,
you're playing for titles.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.520
That's, you know, kind of the goal.

09:54.600 --> 09:59.240
But when you are a lower rank player,
especially if you're in the top 50 or so,

10:01.160 --> 10:03.720
getting that first-round win is huge.

10:04.760 --> 10:08.120
You're talking about $100,000
first-round prize money.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.600
That could just make your entire season.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.280
Are we hitting
or am I gonna hit with somebody?

10:24.360 --> 10:27.360
At the moment, with me. It's up to you.

10:29.440 --> 10:33.920
When I was seven, I already
had this dream of winning a slam.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.200
You dream the biggest when you're a kid.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.120
But maybe someone listens to this
and they're like,

10:40.200 --> 10:42.960
"Okay, you're coming into the slam
ranked 40,

10:43.040 --> 10:45.360
why are you expecting so much?"

10:45.440 --> 10:49.280
But I know what I'm capable of
and I know how much work I've put in.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.080
As soon as I picked up a racket,
I really fell in love with this sport.

10:57.280 --> 11:00.280
I had to, like, drag my parents
to give me lessons.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.720
I have a sister that's two years older.

11:04.240 --> 11:08.360
So I kind of had to fight for
the spotlight a little bit in the family.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.640
And I had to convince my parents that,

11:11.720 --> 11:14.360
"I really want to do
this tennis thing for real."

11:24.120 --> 11:27.200
I remember meeting Ajla
when she was 12 years old.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.200
And I saw a player that had potential.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.000
I grew very close to her
and became like her mentor.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.680
There are more than,
like, 10,000 women pros,

11:41.760 --> 11:45.360
and to get to the top 50,
it's a big achievement.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.960
But she could be top ten.

11:49.760 --> 11:53.760
I always thought the thing missing
from her was her toughness.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.760
I said, "You're too nice."

11:55.840 --> 11:58.600
You know, you've got to be
a little bitchy out there sometimes.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.600
You've got to be mean.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.480
Nice one!

12:15.520 --> 12:17.200
She's a really good player.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.920
Really, like, focused to get better.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.360
You are hitting really good.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.040
<i>Everything started in 2019.</i>

12:30.000 --> 12:31.160
May I…?

12:32.080 --> 12:33.440
Mm.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.080
<i>I texted her on Instagram.</i>

12:40.480 --> 12:43.920
<i>In all honesty,</i>
<i>it wasn't like love at first sight.</i>

12:45.240 --> 12:49.000
I like the fact that, um, she was…

12:49.960 --> 12:51.520
I think she is shy like me.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.960
<i>It was something that, over time, grew.</i>

13:04.720 --> 13:07.800
Do you want to watch a movie
instead of tennis tonight or…?

13:07.880 --> 13:09.320
If we actually finish it…

13:10.320 --> 13:12.800
You're the one
who's always falling asleep.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.560
Why don't we finish the movie, um,

13:15.640 --> 13:18.840
that we started watching
at Christmas, <i>The Holiday?</i>

13:18.920 --> 13:19.960
You watched it ten--

13:20.040 --> 13:23.120
Okay, but I love that movie.
It gets me in such a good mood.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.720
I thought you were into horror or comedy.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.600
-This is a comedy. Romantic comedy.
-Yeah, this is more romantic than comedy.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.240
<i>But whatever it was, I thought that…</i>

13:40.320 --> 13:42.600
<i>We obviously understand each other.</i>

13:42.680 --> 13:45.080
<i>And especially in a sport</i>
<i>that is so tough,</i>

13:45.160 --> 13:48.480
<i>when you don't have your family,</i>
<i>your friends around you.</i>

13:48.560 --> 13:51.760
<i>I think it's so important.</i>

13:51.840 --> 13:53.240
He has a family?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.080
Just wait.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.520
<i>I think we both enjoy</i>
<i>being there for each other.</i>

13:59.600 --> 14:02.640
<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>there aren't challenges.</i>

14:02.720 --> 14:05.960
<i>You just… It's just really good</i>
<i>when we're both winning.</i>

14:06.040 --> 14:08.000
<i>Let's put it that way.</i>

14:12.920 --> 14:16.120
<i>Ajla Tomljanović up against Paula Badosa.</i>

14:24.680 --> 14:27.480
For Ajla, it's a terrible opening draw.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.080
<i>Paula is one of the players</i>
<i>to watch in the Australian Open.</i>

14:35.160 --> 14:36.760
<i>The top-ten player.</i>

14:36.840 --> 14:38.680
<i>Fresh off of a title.</i>

14:38.760 --> 14:40.720
<i>A feared competitor.</i>

14:44.680 --> 14:46.920
It's a drug. This sport is a drug.

14:48.200 --> 14:52.160
Winning big titles, winning big matches.
It's very, very addictive.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.000
But she's a tough player.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.800
She's a fighter and in the Grand Slam,
you're always a little bit more nervous.

14:59.480 --> 15:04.320
Now, it's not gonna be easy. You're
gonna have to fight for every point.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.080
The ball is going to come back.
You're going to have to keep believing.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.360
Let's go!

15:12.600 --> 15:15.560
She's the favorite and I am the underdog.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.600
But I like being in that position.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.760
<i>Here we go, best of three sets.</i>

15:25.600 --> 15:29.120
Ajla has always been a player
who is very hard on herself.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.760
And so that's been one
of the biggest challenges for Ajla.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.080
Paula Badosa to serve.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.960
But if she can believe
in herself in big moments…

15:40.760 --> 15:42.240
Ready. Play.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.800
…she can beat Paula.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.080
Fifteen-love.

15:49.160 --> 15:52.280
From the start of the match,
I knew against her I had to be aggressive.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.320
<i>It's big hitting from both players.</i>

16:02.880 --> 16:05.760
-Game, Tomljanović.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.600
<i>Great start</i>
<i>for Australia's Ajla Tomljanović.</i>

16:20.560 --> 16:23.400
<i>Badosa is finding her way</i>
<i>back into this match.</i>

16:23.480 --> 16:26.120
It's okay. Move it!

16:26.200 --> 16:28.640
Let's go! Come on, Ajla, let's go.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.000
-Game. Badosa.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.560
Badosa leads four games to one.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.840
<i>I'm down and I know that,</i>
<i>if I don't respond here, I am in trouble.</i>

16:48.600 --> 16:49.840
It's okay. Stay positive.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.040
Great, great, great.
That's good. That's good.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.640
-Game Tomljanović.
-Excellent.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.760
<i>I started to believe in myself.</i>

17:11.599 --> 17:13.160
-Come on!
-Keep the pressure up.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.800
She's fighting for every ball.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.839
In my head I was like, "Oh my God,
fuck, Paula, you're going to lose."

17:21.280 --> 17:25.760
<i>The mental side of the game is</i>
<i>what really makes a difference at the top.</i>

17:34.720 --> 17:36.560
Game and first set, Badosa.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.160
Six games to four.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.960
<i>I start thinking, like,</i>
<i>"Am I capable of doing this?"</i>

17:49.040 --> 17:49.920
Time.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.760
-Ajla, come on.
-Keep the pressure on.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.520
Second set.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.280
That's where everything
started kinda going downhill.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.440
No. No. No.
She starts changing. She's losing it.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.760
<i>My thoughts just kind of start spiraling.</i>

18:32.880 --> 18:35.840
<i>All the negativity</i>
<i>coming at me all at once.</i>

18:36.600 --> 18:39.960
Come on. You're good, you're good.
Stay positive.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.120
<i>That little voice in your head</i>
<i>doesn't stop.</i>

18:45.080 --> 18:46.640
Game, Badosa.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.600
Badosa leads three games to love.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.280
Badosa leads four games to love.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.600
<i>I blink, and it's five-love.</i>

18:57.360 --> 18:59.200
-Game, Badosa.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.360
<i>Everything stopped being fun.</i>

19:05.840 --> 19:08.720
<i>Paula Badosa with match point.</i>

19:18.480 --> 19:20.640
Game, set and match, Badosa.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.760
Two sets to love. Six four, six love.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.720
<i>You've got to feel for Tomljanović.</i>

19:33.800 --> 19:36.760
<i>She just hasn't been able</i>
<i>to convert tonight.</i>

19:53.760 --> 19:55.920
I'm just so angry. I'm so angry.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.760
I wanted to break all my rackets
out there. All of them.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.480
I feel you.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.720
I mean, it's not fun.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.240
When you're playing like that
and having that problem…

20:09.320 --> 20:11.960
When you're playing
such great tennis, yeah.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.360
Feels like heavyweight
against lightweight.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.680
What's the point of being out there
if I don't believe I can win?

20:24.160 --> 20:27.480
There are certain things you can control
and things you can't.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.960
Maybe this is in my control,
I'm just controlling it horribly.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.680
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
I don't know.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.920
Like, it's easy. I just retire.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.200
I feel like, "Well, am I fucking crazy?"

20:41.280 --> 20:44.520
-No. You have something there.
-It's screwing up my mind.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.280
You have something there.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.640
Are you all right?

21:11.240 --> 21:14.000
You left the court
with tears in your eyes.

21:14.960 --> 21:19.240
When you lose a match that
you could've won or something like that,

21:19.320 --> 21:22.160
does it help you
when you kind of say, "Okay."

21:22.240 --> 21:25.840
"I'm going to try this different.
I'm not going to have regrets."

21:27.280 --> 21:31.040
No, you do that better than me.
I don't do that as well.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.200
You sound like
you know exactly what you're doing.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.040
Of course I had doubts and stuff.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.400
Like I had fears and…
"What if it's not going to work?"

21:39.480 --> 21:43.200
But I knew all the experiences
they are doing, in the end,

21:43.280 --> 21:46.400
eventually they're going to be helpful
in the moments

21:47.600 --> 21:49.160
when you're gonna win.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.360
No.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.400
<i>It's another gorgeous day</i>
<i>here in Melbourne.</i>

22:02.480 --> 22:04.960
<i>And the players are all getting out</i>
<i>on the practice court,</i>

22:05.040 --> 22:06.960
<i>keeping sharp for the next round.</i>

22:23.080 --> 22:24.920
Sometimes, I can't do anything about it.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.440
Sometimes, you're less comfortable
with that.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.040
You're lacking something there.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.320
On the normal ones,
you're timing it really well.

22:36.960 --> 22:42.080
When we first met,
he was just a little kid.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.280
He had a strong personality,

22:45.360 --> 22:48.880
tenacious, a real will to win,

22:48.960 --> 22:53.280
and he was curious, so he listened.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.800
Does he still listen to you?

22:57.880 --> 23:00.840
I hope so!
I don't know if he still listens to me.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.360
It's a good question.

23:09.960 --> 23:14.280
<i>The action continues to</i>
<i>heat up as the third round gets underway.</i>

23:19.760 --> 23:23.200
<i>The challengers continue</i>
<i>their progress towards the finals…</i>

23:25.040 --> 23:28.360
<i>Rafael Nadal</i>
<i>also managed to battle his way</i>

23:28.440 --> 23:30.280
<i>through four sets to reach the next round.</i>

23:31.840 --> 23:34.600
You had problems with your foot injury.
It put you out last year.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.120
Is your foot giving you
more freedom to play?

23:37.880 --> 23:39.960
Well, for the moment, yes.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.240
<i>But there's one draw</i>
<i>that everyone's talking about.</i>

23:44.320 --> 23:49.000
<i>World number seven, Matteo Berrettini,</i>
<i>faces young gun Carlos Alcaraz.</i>

23:49.880 --> 23:54.200
Playing Carlos in the third round
in a slam is going to be really tough.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.080
Carlos Alcaraz is lightning in a bottle.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.800
A teenager that we haven't seen
the likes of since a young Rafa Nadal.

24:13.240 --> 24:18.480
Just awesome physical talent
and understands what it takes

24:18.560 --> 24:20.680
to manage moments of huge pressure.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.920
He's one of the rising stars on the tour
and it's impressive.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.760
Mentally, how are you feeling?

24:37.840 --> 24:39.920
I know it's not going to be easy.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.560
I know that I want to win, but also,

24:46.240 --> 24:48.360
like, in a way, I feel like,

24:48.440 --> 24:51.000
there is also that kind of pressure,
you know?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.120
Now, I'm a little bit older,

24:55.200 --> 24:57.720
there are so many players coming up
that are so young.

24:59.320 --> 25:02.240
The generation behind
is not going to wait for us.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.120
And so the fighting spirit
has to be there, 100%.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.440
It's my time.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.240
These are the years
that I have to push through.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.280
It's now or never.

25:19.080 --> 25:23.040
Would you please
welcome, from Spain, Carlos Alcaraz!

25:24.240 --> 25:27.520
<i>Carlos Alcaraz, the new kid on the block.</i>

25:27.600 --> 25:29.200
<i>We call him the "young Rafa."</i>

25:30.000 --> 25:32.680
And his opponent,
our seventh seed, from Italy,

25:32.760 --> 25:34.120
Matteo Berrettini!

25:37.320 --> 25:39.240
<i>I feel nervous.</i>

25:39.320 --> 25:42.680
<i>But I try to be nervous.</i>
<i>It's a good thing.</i>

25:42.760 --> 25:44.160
First sets.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.920
<i>Huge serving from the Italian.</i>

26:16.720 --> 26:18.680
<i>No sign of any nerves early on.</i>

26:18.760 --> 26:21.600
Berrettini leads five games to two.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.960
-Come on!

26:26.920 --> 26:30.800
<i>The first set is indeed</i>
<i>Matteo Berrettini's.</i>

26:32.520 --> 26:34.840
<i>I'm playing good.</i>
<i>I'm feeling confident.</i>

26:36.720 --> 26:38.720
<i>Perfect start to the second set.</i>

26:52.240 --> 26:56.240
<i>Matteo Berrettini</i>
<i>with a real stranglehold in this match.</i>

27:02.760 --> 27:05.400
Second set, Berrettini.

27:05.480 --> 27:09.920
<i>Berrettini now moves ahead</i>
<i>into a really commanding position.</i>

27:22.640 --> 27:25.840
<i>I felt really, really close</i>
<i>to win the match.</i>

27:32.400 --> 27:34.040
<i>I missed one forehand.</i>

27:34.120 --> 27:37.280
<i>Well, Alcaraz breaks Berrettini there.</i>

27:38.000 --> 27:42.160
<i>Tennis is like this.</i>
<i>In two seconds, everything can change.</i>

27:47.480 --> 27:49.320
<i>The momentum switched.</i>

27:54.320 --> 27:58.600
<i>Carlos Alcaraz has nicked</i>
<i>this third set off Matteo Berrettini.</i>

28:06.080 --> 28:08.240
<i>He finds, like, the right energy.</i>

28:09.440 --> 28:10.960
<i>The right mindset.</i>

28:14.440 --> 28:16.480
<i>And the crowd is all for him.</i>

28:16.560 --> 28:18.680
Game, Alcaraz.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.280
<i>Your brain fucks with you.</i>

28:24.360 --> 28:26.640
<i>Berrettini is unraveling here.</i>

28:29.960 --> 28:32.200
<i>You just want to get out of the situation.</i>

28:37.440 --> 28:40.920
<i>Carlos Alcaraz</i>
<i>has turned this match on its head.</i>

28:41.560 --> 28:44.400
<i>It's fifth set time on Rod Laver Arena.</i>

28:45.800 --> 28:47.680
<i>I feel like a lot of fear.</i>

28:48.360 --> 28:50.800
<i>I'm not going to be able</i>
<i>to win this match.</i>

28:52.520 --> 28:58.240
<i>But, as always, it's the balance</i>
<i>between the fear and the will.</i>

28:59.240 --> 29:00.680
<i>If there is no fear,</i>

29:01.720 --> 29:02.840
<i>there is no will.</i>

29:09.440 --> 29:11.320
<i>What a hit from Berrettini.</i>

29:13.400 --> 29:15.080
<i>That'll get him going again.</i>

29:18.800 --> 29:21.080
<i>I'm not going to give him anything.</i>

29:21.880 --> 29:26.760
<i>In those moments, you really realize</i>
<i>how strong you are inside.</i>

29:36.760 --> 29:38.320
<i>Oh, no!</i>

29:42.680 --> 29:46.760
<i>Let's just hope</i>
<i>that Berrettini is okay here.</i>

29:50.920 --> 29:53.400
<i>When I think about how hard I worked…</i>

29:55.480 --> 29:57.240
<i>it's just impossible to…</i>

29:58.560 --> 30:00.440
<i>to give up.</i>

30:02.160 --> 30:03.640
Matteo!

30:13.640 --> 30:16.240
Six games all.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.160
Final set. Tie break.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.720
<i>And we're into</i>
<i>a super tie break to decide this match.</i>

30:24.280 --> 30:26.760
<i>It's just first to ten points.</i>

30:27.600 --> 30:31.000
<i>Fasten your seat belts,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

30:31.080 --> 30:35.240
<i>The fear of losing</i>
<i>brings me to my best level.</i>

30:45.160 --> 30:47.480
<i>These two men continue to lock horns.</i>

30:50.720 --> 30:54.880
<i>Three hours and 55</i>
<i>minutes in. Almost at the four-hour mark.</i>

30:57.640 --> 30:59.520
<i>A big miss from Alcaraz.</i>

31:02.480 --> 31:03.440
<i>Match point.</i>

31:07.120 --> 31:09.760
Game, set and match, Berrettini.

31:09.840 --> 31:14.160
Three sets to two. Six-two,
seven-six, four-six, two-six, seven-six.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.800
Come on.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.040
Good match, dude.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.560
<i>I am really proud.</i>

31:32.000 --> 31:34.200
I proved to myself that

31:34.280 --> 31:38.760
I think my biggest weapon
is not my serve, is not my forehand,

31:38.840 --> 31:40.920
but it's my mindset.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.440
That was horrible.
That was horrible.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.520
Fuck! Now it's time to suffer.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.240
Yeah, I'd like you to go lower.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.480
-<i>My love.</i>
-Hello.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.120
<i>My love! Amazing!</i>

32:23.200 --> 32:24.960
<i>Fantastic, you're a hero!</i>

32:25.040 --> 32:26.640
You're on Netflix, Grandma.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.640
<i>Amazing!</i>

32:30.720 --> 32:31.720
Thank you!

32:31.800 --> 32:34.600
Mamma mia, <i>how wonderful!</i>

32:35.480 --> 32:37.760
<i>Darling, you were great!</i>

32:37.840 --> 32:39.720
<i>Let me show you Grandpa.</i>

32:40.360 --> 32:41.600
<i>We did it!</i>

32:43.720 --> 32:46.640
<i>We beat his ass!</i>

32:48.200 --> 32:50.200
Thank you, bye!

32:50.280 --> 32:53.480
-<i>I love you!</i>
-You too. Bye!

32:54.000 --> 32:55.280
<i>Kisses to Ajla.</i>

32:55.360 --> 32:57.200
Yes, bye.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.040
<i>How handsome you are!</i>

33:04.200 --> 33:05.240
I'm tired.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.960
The room is a mess.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.320
-Who was the last one that left the room?
-Was it me?

33:17.400 --> 33:20.080
-No, me?
-No, but just leave it. It's okay.

33:24.720 --> 33:28.280
-What's your schedule tomorrow?
-Um…

33:28.360 --> 33:32.480
I think I'm hitting in the afternoon.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.920
And then we'll see.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.760
I'm going to wake up at 7:45.

33:38.560 --> 33:42.000
-Where do you have to go?
-I have to do, um,

33:42.080 --> 33:44.440
Tennis Channel at 8:15 live,

33:44.520 --> 33:46.600
so I'm going to be in that room.

33:46.680 --> 33:49.160
But I'm not going to be able to be silent.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.800
No, Ajla, okay.
But this is not… I have to sleep.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.840
-What are you talking about?
-8:15, though.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.320
-Okay, but--
-Where should I go?

33:59.400 --> 34:00.480
Somewhere else?

34:00.560 --> 34:03.920
You go downstairs and ask for a room.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.600
They're not going to give me a room
for ten minutes.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.360
That's exactly why they're going to give
you a room, because it's ten minutes.

34:10.440 --> 34:14.360
Okay, I'm going to do what you said.
I'm going to find the business center.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.960
Go downstairs.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.320
And I'm going to say,
on air, that you kicked me out.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.280
But they're gonna agree with me.

34:22.040 --> 34:25.159
I'm still in the Australian Open.
Who cares about ten minutes?

34:25.239 --> 34:27.679
It's like… Okay, fine. Fine.

34:27.760 --> 34:31.199
It's like ten minutes of talking.
You wouldn't even hear me out there.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.280
Yeah.

34:33.520 --> 34:37.880
<i>Tennis players</i>
<i>are notoriously self-centered.</i>

34:39.400 --> 34:42.880
<i>But they have to be to do well</i>
<i>in this individual sport.</i>

34:42.960 --> 34:45.840
<i>It has to be about you</i>
<i>and putting you first</i>

34:46.920 --> 34:49.320
<i>in order for them to win these big titles.</i>

35:03.560 --> 35:07.560
One of my biggest cliches that I love to
death and I've used a thousand times, is…

35:09.880 --> 35:13.440
"You always question
all-time greats at your own peril."

35:19.400 --> 35:23.440
<i>Nadal arrived in Melbourne</i>
<i>back from a career-threatening foot injury</i>

35:23.520 --> 35:26.200
<i>that sidelined him in 2021.</i>

35:27.120 --> 35:30.760
<i>He didn't know</i>
<i>if he would even be able to compete here.</i>

35:31.280 --> 35:34.400
<i>But you never write off Rafael Nadal.</i>

35:35.040 --> 35:38.960
<i>This is men's singles</i>
<i>quarterfinals on Rod Laver Arena.</i>

35:50.560 --> 35:53.760
The way Nadal deals with things is insane.

35:53.840 --> 35:58.360
He's like a god, like
the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.680
This guy never gives up.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.880
Literally comes back
from being down all the time.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.520
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

36:20.720 --> 36:23.160
<i>Rafa doing Rafa things.</i>

36:23.240 --> 36:27.640
For me, Rafa Nadal is the greatest
competitor that's ever played any sport.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.840
<i>Monumental triumph!</i>

36:30.920 --> 36:34.400
<i>He is an all-time great for a reason.</i>

36:34.480 --> 36:37.840
<i>Nadal moves through to the final four,</i>

36:37.920 --> 36:42.520
<i>where he will face</i>
<i>the Italian challenger, Matteo Berrettini.</i>

36:45.120 --> 36:47.920
Matteo is one of the best players
in the world.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.560
Yeah, no. I need to play my 100%.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.320
Playing semifinals against Rafa,

36:55.400 --> 36:58.720
still now, it doesn't seem…
it doesn't feel real.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.920
I'm doing it and I deserve to do it.
You know, my level is there.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.280
But there is still like
that child part that is saying, "Wow."

37:08.360 --> 37:11.120
You know, like I still get, um…

37:11.200 --> 37:14.960
It feels really nice when Rafa is passing
by and saying, "Congrats on your match,"

37:15.040 --> 37:19.000
because I was looking at him
and watching him when I was a kid.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.560
So now being in the same draw
all of this stuff, like,

37:22.640 --> 37:24.240
it feels really nice, special.

37:32.720 --> 37:36.800
Don't you think it's funny how,
two years ago,

37:36.880 --> 37:40.600
I left the US Open in the same moment?

37:41.800 --> 37:44.040
Yeah, I was thinking exactly the same.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.400
You left the night before my match.
Like exactly the same.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.120
-Good luck tomorrow, mate.
-Thank you.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.160
So what's the schedule now that you have?

38:02.240 --> 38:04.760
I can actually technically
play Charleston.

38:04.840 --> 38:08.480
Then I'm skipping the first week of
playing Europe and then I'll go to Madrid.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.360
Okay.

38:11.920 --> 38:15.520
If you're not winning the event,
you're a loser every week.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.640
That's why I think
tennis is really brutal in a way,

38:19.320 --> 38:21.560
because it keeps going
with or without you.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.920
So that part is definitely tough.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.600
I don't think I can close this one.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.000
Do you need help?
You did it.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.880
Okay, one down.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.440
Forty-three to go.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.920
In tennis, you lose
so much more than you win.

38:46.640 --> 38:51.720
But even when you're a champion,
and you come off the court losing,

38:51.800 --> 38:53.720
you ask yourself, "Am I good enough?"

38:57.000 --> 39:00.360
But you have to keep facing it,
otherwise you're not a tennis player.

39:02.880 --> 39:06.160
That's the whole point of this sport,
is that you are always searching,

39:06.240 --> 39:10.880
always trying to find out, you know,
who you are and where you'll go.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.520
My flight's at eleven.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.040
When are you two seeing each other again?

39:20.120 --> 39:21.120
Indian Wells.

39:21.960 --> 39:22.880
Okay.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.960
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

39:35.800 --> 39:36.920
Bye.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.360
As you progress through,

39:42.320 --> 39:46.360
by the end
it's a strange feeling because…

39:47.600 --> 39:49.200
practice courts are empty.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.400
But the media is at a fever pitch.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.480
So it has a sense of gravity.

39:56.560 --> 40:00.160
You know, you can kind of feel the weight
of the actual moment.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.800
It's like, "Okay, it's go time."

40:02.880 --> 40:05.120
Are we ready to do this?

40:09.400 --> 40:12.000
When I was a kid, my idol was Roger.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.560
But then growing up,
that's when I started to appreciate Rafa.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.720
Like, his mental toughness
is unbelievable.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.840
I've never won against him.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.440
But at the same time,
this world really pushes you to the limit.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.680
I was really close last year
to win a slam.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.600
And I want to feel that feeling again.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.160
So, I know it's tough.

40:38.920 --> 40:43.000
I respect the task,
but I believe I can do it.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.480
<i>After 11 days of competition,</i>

40:56.560 --> 41:00.760
<i>we have arrived</i>
<i>at the men's semifinals matches.</i>

41:01.680 --> 41:05.400
<i>A spot in Sunday's final is up for grabs.</i>

41:11.760 --> 41:13.720
Playing Rafa in a slam

41:14.280 --> 41:18.000
is one of the biggest challenges
you can ever face.

41:20.760 --> 41:24.480
When you're playing against
the greats, it really humbles you.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.160
You respected their abilities,
you knew what they accomplished.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.440
But with Rafa,
the game plan is very clear,

41:33.200 --> 41:35.640
you're not going to get
into extended rallies.

41:35.720 --> 41:39.200
His physicality and what he does so well
is so difficult to deal with.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.040
You don't want this thing
going nine and ten rounds.

41:43.120 --> 41:47.000
You've got to get in there and punch him
in the mouth. Like, you can't wait.

41:54.800 --> 41:58.480
Please welcome our seventh
seed from Italy, Matteo Berrettini!

42:03.160 --> 42:07.160
<i>Stepping in the court for</i>
<i>a match like that, it doesn't feel real.</i>

42:07.800 --> 42:09.280
<i>It's too good to be true.</i>

42:10.000 --> 42:13.400
And his opponent today, Rafael Nadal!

42:17.520 --> 42:19.200
<i>But at the same time,</i>

42:19.280 --> 42:22.800
<i>if you think you're playing</i>
<i>against like some sort of god…</i>

42:27.520 --> 42:29.400
<i>they're gonna eat you alive.</i>

42:46.520 --> 42:49.800
<i>Berrettini has to do something different.</i>

42:49.880 --> 42:50.880
Fault.

42:52.560 --> 42:56.560
<i>He's going to try to find</i>
<i>something and it's got to be very quick.</i>

43:07.640 --> 43:11.240
<i>It is quintessentially</i>
<i>what Nadal is all about.</i>

43:11.320 --> 43:14.080
<i>Rock solid from start to finish.</i>

43:15.720 --> 43:17.520
<i>I'm not in the right mindset.</i>

43:18.280 --> 43:20.120
<i>I'm too happy to be there.</i>

43:20.760 --> 43:22.400
<i>Not feeling enough pressure.</i>

43:26.720 --> 43:29.360
-<i>This is one-way traffic.</i>

43:37.280 --> 43:40.160
<i>I'm just a little worried</i>
<i>here for Berrettini.</i>

43:44.400 --> 43:47.200
<i>You need to be fresh</i>
<i>and the mind needs to believe.</i>

43:47.280 --> 43:50.560
<i>I'm not sure it's right there</i>
<i>at the moment for the Italian stallion.</i>

43:54.800 --> 43:56.800
Game and set, Nadal.

43:56.880 --> 44:00.760
<i>That was a knockout punch.</i>
<i>Berrettini, nearly down and out.</i>

44:02.440 --> 44:04.360
<i>I start to curse myself.</i>

44:05.920 --> 44:08.440
<i>I was thinking about my parents back home.</i>

44:09.520 --> 44:13.240
<i>He has given Berrettini</i>
<i>no breathing room whatsoever.</i>

44:17.160 --> 44:19.680
I shouldn't feel happy
for what's happening.

44:19.760 --> 44:22.400
I should feel embarrassed.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.920
And suddenly I feel the fear coming.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.360
Okay, now I'm going to show you
what I have inside.

44:49.680 --> 44:51.760
<i>I start to feel the ball better.</i>

44:59.080 --> 45:04.080
<i>When you feel in the right</i>
<i>mindset, it's like the show started.</i>

45:07.680 --> 45:10.920
<i>I'm just in the zone</i>
<i>like nobody's watching.</i>

45:13.880 --> 45:15.240
<i>It's peaceful.</i>

45:17.720 --> 45:20.840
<i>I like really to lead</i>
<i>those moments because,</i>

45:20.920 --> 45:23.960
<i>in a way, I get to know myself</i>
<i>way better when I'm there.</i>

45:29.720 --> 45:31.040
<i>This is who I am.</i>

45:36.040 --> 45:38.960
<i>That is a little bit of Matteo magic.</i>

45:46.240 --> 45:48.240
<i>I feel like a different player.</i>

45:51.520 --> 45:53.000
<i>I feel I have a chance to win.</i>

45:55.440 --> 45:59.440
<i>Wow! First ever set against Nadal.</i>

46:00.160 --> 46:02.400
<i>And we are going the distance.</i>

46:02.480 --> 46:05.200
<i>This is the battle we were looking for.</i>

46:06.360 --> 46:10.200
<i>I feel I have a chance there.</i>
<i>It's now or never.</i>

46:25.040 --> 46:28.120
Being afraid to lose is about your ego.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.280
Of course you don't want to lose.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.800
All-time greats, they're not afraid.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.200
They're just like, "I am doing it."

46:46.280 --> 46:48.400
They're not afraid to lay it on the line.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.800
That's different, and that's special.

47:11.400 --> 47:14.040
<i>Rafa has two match points.</i>

47:38.920 --> 47:43.600
<i>Rafael Nadal</i>
<i>beats Berrettini in four sets.</i>

48:04.600 --> 48:06.440
<i>He's never done.</i>

48:06.520 --> 48:10.560
<i>He manages to push himself</i>
<i>to the limit every time.</i>

48:13.040 --> 48:15.120
What's your greatest fear?

48:17.360 --> 48:20.080
Feeling that I could have done more

48:20.160 --> 48:23.640
and I didn't try, like I didn't, uh…

48:24.760 --> 48:27.560
I didn't give everything that I had.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.720
Like what my parents told me.

48:38.680 --> 48:41.880
-What can you do?
-He played well.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.840
I mean, I hope they're proud of me.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.080
Next time.

48:51.440 --> 48:54.160
<i>Obviously, I'm disappointed</i>
<i>for today's match.</i>

48:54.240 --> 48:57.600
I expected for myself
a little bit more but…

48:58.360 --> 49:00.720
It is what it is. I have to learn.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.200
You cannot be in the court
I think like this

49:04.280 --> 49:07.520
for the first two sets
against a player like Rafa.

49:10.080 --> 49:15.360
<i>I feel like it doesn't matter how much</i>
<i>you try, you're just not good enough.</i>

49:24.880 --> 49:27.000
<i>It's a tough world.</i>

49:31.080 --> 49:34.840
<i>The 2022 Australian Open</i>
<i>Men's singles final</i>

49:34.920 --> 49:37.960
<i>is Daniil Medvedev and Rafael Nadal.</i>

49:44.560 --> 49:46.880
-Well played, mate.
-Thank you.

49:48.320 --> 49:51.840
But somehow there's always
a moment where I feel,

49:51.920 --> 49:54.720
"Okay, I don't want
to feel like this anymore."

49:55.360 --> 49:59.680
I want to get back to the court and get
better. Because I don't want to lose.

50:02.360 --> 50:06.160
I'm going to prove to the people
that love me

50:06.240 --> 50:07.800
that I can do it.

50:11.680 --> 50:14.000
<i>It's the miracle in Melbourne</i>

50:14.080 --> 50:18.720
<i>in one of the most</i>
<i>improbable victories of all time.</i>

50:18.800 --> 50:21.480
Rafa! Rafa! Rafa!

50:23.640 --> 50:25.760
For a long time we've been talking about

50:25.840 --> 50:28.840
when Rafa and Roger and Novak
are going to get old.

50:28.920 --> 50:30.680
When are they gonna actually slip?

50:32.800 --> 50:35.720
And you just can't count greats out,

50:37.400 --> 50:42.360
because they do things that we can't
really fully wrap our minds around.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.320
<i>Twenty-one major titles</i>

50:46.400 --> 50:49.920
<i>from one</i>
<i>of the greatest players of all time.</i>

50:57.880 --> 51:00.360
<i>I want to be number one in the world.</i>

51:01.120 --> 51:04.320
<i>But when you want things so badly,</i>

51:04.400 --> 51:07.360
<i>sometimes you just cannot handle</i>
<i>the pressure.</i>

51:08.760 --> 51:11.360
<i>Who is the best American male right now?</i>

51:11.440 --> 51:13.080
<i>Taylor Fritz.</i>

51:13.160 --> 51:15.440
You're gonna make me look
like a cocky asshole.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.000
<i>It's the biggest match of my life.</i>

51:21.080 --> 51:23.920
<i>If I pulled out, I'd be thinking</i>
<i>about this forever.</i>

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
<i>Could be career-ending.</i>

51:30.600 --> 51:34.760
<i>It is a day</i>
<i>he will remember for the rest of his life.</i>
