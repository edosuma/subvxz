WEBVTT

00:11.236 --> 00:14.171
Sorry, I'm gonna be a while.

00:14.206 --> 00:15.791
Excuse me, do you know
where there's another...

00:15.865 --> 00:18.075
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

00:26.752 --> 00:28.251
Stop!

00:31.368 --> 00:32.222
Oh, my God.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.358
Sadie.

Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:45.003 --> 00:46.636
Call 911!

00:47.616 --> 00:49.639
Call 911!

01:00.579 --> 01:04.312
Now, Rick, be charming
but not too charming.

01:04.385 --> 01:06.672
That's like asking superman
not to be too super.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.080
What's wrong
with being too charming?

01:08.112 --> 01:11.457
Nothing, except when you are
testifying in a murder trial.

01:11.510 --> 01:13.933
Look, being charming tells
the jury that you're confident,

01:13.975 --> 01:16.747
but being too charming tells them that
you're trying to be manipulative.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.691
Oh, I see. This is why
you never had me testify

01:19.712 --> 01:21.412
in any of our cases.

01:21.507 --> 01:22.739
You're jealous of my charm.

01:22.808 --> 01:24.408
I'm serious, okay?
Don't get cocky.

01:24.476 --> 01:26.435
This is the first time
you'll be testifying in court,

01:26.477 --> 01:28.071
and it can get nerve-racking.

01:28.134 --> 01:30.308
I'll be fine, especially
since word on the street

01:30.340 --> 01:32.616
is the defense lawyer
is a total hack.

01:32.651 --> 01:34.161
Oh, yeah? Who is it?

01:34.234 --> 01:35.452
Stan Novak.

01:35.487 --> 01:36.954
"Short attention span" Stan?

01:36.989 --> 01:39.389
That guy gets lost
in his own cross examinations.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.025
Yeah. You will be fine.

01:42.415 --> 01:43.999
Too bad you won't be there
to see me in action.

01:44.051 --> 01:46.099
- No, but I will.
- Is that wise?

01:46.152 --> 01:48.315
I mean, publicly, aren't we
still supposed to be separated?

01:48.358 --> 01:51.133
This is the Sadie Beakman murder
trial we're talking about.

01:51.186 --> 01:52.748
Her reporting from Iraq

01:52.780 --> 01:54.838
shaped the way
many Americans saw the war.

01:54.874 --> 01:57.977
Plus it gave her the profile
to launch her own news website.

01:58.020 --> 02:01.512
And as captain of the precinct
that closed her murder case,

02:01.580 --> 02:03.247
it would be odd
if I didn't show.

02:03.315 --> 02:05.587
Then we should come up
with a secret signal.

02:05.735 --> 02:07.692
A little thing just between
the two of us that says,

02:07.766 --> 02:08.441
"I love you."

02:08.494 --> 02:10.954
Oh, you know, I think
that would be a little...

02:11.650 --> 02:12.610
Do you need a tissue?

02:12.674 --> 02:14.373
No, this is my...
that's the secret "I love you" signal.

02:14.405 --> 02:15.793
- Do you like it?
- Rubbing your nose?

02:15.861 --> 02:17.661
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's really romantic.

02:18.501 --> 02:19.103
Anyway, I got to go.

02:19.134 --> 02:21.002
I'm meeting Vikram.
I'll see you at the court.

02:21.045 --> 02:22.818
Yes, I love you, too.

02:28.042 --> 02:29.173
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:29.241 --> 02:30.881
Where are we
on surveilling Caleb Brown

02:30.912 --> 02:33.034
and connecting him to loksat?

02:33.340 --> 02:35.018
Exactly where we were last week

02:35.060 --> 02:37.214
and the week before that
and the week before that.

02:37.283 --> 02:38.348
So nowhere?

02:38.417 --> 02:39.917
Our target
at the public defender's office

02:40.019 --> 02:42.043
is like a super villain...
No weaknesses.

02:42.106 --> 02:43.387
Oh, come on.
That's not possible.

02:43.594 --> 02:45.422
Sure about that? 'Cause Cee Cee
and I have tried every pos...

02:45.458 --> 02:48.808
- Wait, what? Who's Cee Cee?
- No one.

02:49.223 --> 02:51.756
Did you give your computer
a girl's name?

02:52.041 --> 02:53.075
You don't know my life.

02:53.138 --> 02:55.946
Huh. I've never been happier
about that until this moment.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.708
Look, I am tired
of lying to everyone.

02:57.750 --> 02:58.702
I want my life back,

02:58.737 --> 03:00.904
and given your new relationship
with your computer,

03:00.940 --> 03:02.639
it's time you get yours
back, too.

03:02.675 --> 03:05.976
So let's figure this out.
What is Caleb Brown's weakness?

03:07.033 --> 03:09.819
This is gonna be the easiest
case I have ever tried.

03:10.009 --> 03:10.881
How can you be so sure?

03:10.950 --> 03:12.783
The defendant
has a history of arrest

03:12.818 --> 03:15.486
for robbing high-end houses
while working as a cater waiter.

03:15.554 --> 03:17.321
Sadie Beakman caught her
in the act

03:17.343 --> 03:19.790
and the defendant killed her
in order to get away.

03:19.859 --> 03:21.391
Isn't that all circumstantial?

03:21.460 --> 03:23.794
Yes, which is why it's
a good thing I have you...

03:23.863 --> 03:25.129
An eyewitness.

03:25.231 --> 03:27.498
The defendant really should've
taken that plea deal I offered.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.699
Yeah. Why didn't she?

03:28.801 --> 03:30.434
What do you think
their defense is gonna be?

03:30.469 --> 03:31.869
Don't concern yourself
with that.

03:31.971 --> 03:33.837
No matter how he tries
to spin the facts,

03:33.939 --> 03:35.172
you stick with what you saw.

03:35.241 --> 03:37.169
Nina O'Keefe
killed Sadie Beakman.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.805
The victim's family.

03:38.858 --> 03:40.477
Oh, yes, I remember.

03:40.546 --> 03:41.945
Hi. Nice to see you again.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.248
Sorry it's under
such terrible circumstances.

03:44.350 --> 03:45.349
Yeah. Us, too.

03:45.451 --> 03:46.950
So, how are you holding up?

03:47.019 --> 03:48.719
Some good days, more bad.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.021
We can't seem to get over it.

03:51.084 --> 03:52.531
You know, my wife spent
two years embedded

03:52.605 --> 03:54.167
with troops in Iraq
and not a scratch.

03:54.219 --> 03:57.143
And then a party in Manhattan.
Doesn't make sense.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.029
Well, we're gonna get her
justice.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.777
Marcus. Hey. Glad you
could make it, Captain.

04:13.812 --> 04:16.613
So, um, what is this I hear
about you asking Lanie out?

04:16.682 --> 04:18.291
No, no, no, no.
You got that wrong.

04:18.450 --> 04:19.583
Lanie asked me.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.418
Really? That's what I...

04:21.487 --> 04:22.853
Nina.

04:23.357 --> 04:24.922
My name is Caleb Brown from
the public defender's office.

04:24.957 --> 04:26.540
I'll be representing you today.

04:26.814 --> 04:28.524
What is Caleb Brown doing here?

04:28.661 --> 04:29.991
That's a good question.

04:30.297 --> 04:32.596
All rise!
This court is now in session.

04:32.665 --> 04:35.599
The honorable
judge Gloria Wollcott presiding.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.555
Be seated.

04:40.278 --> 04:42.515
Well, well, well,
Mr. Caleb Brown.

04:42.568 --> 04:45.439
As lovely as it is to see you in
my courtroom, where's Mr. Novak?

04:45.523 --> 04:46.143
Your Honor,

04:46.178 --> 04:48.453
Mr. Novak's wife went
into premature labor last night.

04:48.695 --> 04:49.403
Oh, no.

04:49.466 --> 04:50.948
The baby's fine,
as is the mother,

04:51.050 --> 04:52.516
but obviously Mr. Novak
is unavailable,

04:52.585 --> 04:54.551
so the public defender's office
asked me to take over.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.987
- And you're up to speed on the case?
- Yes, Your Honor.

04:57.056 --> 04:59.222
Plus I did a little work
on my own this morning.

04:59.338 --> 05:02.272
- Any objections, Mr. Weller?
- None, Your Honor.

05:02.420 --> 05:05.395
Then let's proceed, shall we?
Bailiff, bring in the jury.

05:05.755 --> 05:07.698
The people call
Roger masters, Your Honor.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.800
Sadie was kind, thoughtful.
She was generous.

05:09.902 --> 05:12.069
I would know. We were friends
for over 20 years.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.104
I was her cameraman back
when she was still

05:14.139 --> 05:16.506
a news correspondent
before she started her website.

05:16.542 --> 05:19.176
Thank you, Mr. Masters.
No further questions.

05:19.245 --> 05:22.312
So, the murder took place at
your townhouse, is that correct?

05:22.414 --> 05:23.513
I'm afraid so.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.148
My wife and I hosted
the cocktail party

05:25.217 --> 05:26.450
where your client killed Sadie.

05:26.518 --> 05:28.785
Did you see my client kill her?

05:29.168 --> 05:30.687
No. No, I did not.

05:30.756 --> 05:33.557
The fireplace poker
punctured the ribcage

05:33.592 --> 05:35.392
and nicked Mrs. Beakman's aorta,

05:35.427 --> 05:38.295
causing massive blood loss
and her eventual death.

05:38.364 --> 05:40.313
Did Mrs. Beakman
die immediately?

05:40.555 --> 05:42.191
It would've taken
5 to 10 minutes

05:42.244 --> 05:44.034
for her to succumb
to her wounds.

05:44.069 --> 05:47.204
Dr. Parish, would Mrs. Beakman
have been in much pain?

05:47.273 --> 05:49.239
Yes. Excruciating pain.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.607
No further questions, Your Honor.

05:50.643 --> 05:52.342
The defendant was on the run
until me and my partner...

05:52.411 --> 05:54.544
Until my partner and I caught up
with her at Grand Central Terminal.

05:54.647 --> 05:56.613
And... and did my client confess?

05:56.715 --> 05:58.545
No. She didn't make a statement.

05:58.619 --> 05:59.750
- The only thing she said...
- The only thing she said

05:59.818 --> 06:01.952
was that she wanted to speak
with a lawyer.

06:03.622 --> 06:05.965
The people call Richard Castle.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.414
Raise your right hand.

06:16.604 --> 06:18.101
Oh, sorry.
This is the right hand.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.028
Do you swear
to tell the truth, the whole truth,

06:20.049 --> 06:22.139
- and nothing but the truth?
- I do.

06:23.564 --> 06:26.143
Mr. Castle, what is it
that you do for a living?

06:26.211 --> 06:27.785
I'm a murder-mystery novelist.

06:27.859 --> 06:29.063
Have you held any other jobs?

06:29.115 --> 06:31.588
Yeah, six years
as a civilian investigator

06:31.672 --> 06:35.208
working with the NYPD,
homicides for the 12th precinct.

06:35.292 --> 06:37.118
So, you're a bit of an expert

06:37.202 --> 06:38.288
when it comes
to solving murders?

06:38.390 --> 06:40.290
Yes, and I use that expertise

06:40.359 --> 06:42.559
to lend authenticity
to my novels.

06:42.594 --> 06:46.163
Now, what brought you to the
home of Roger and Joanna Masters

06:46.265 --> 06:48.832
on the evening of September 14th
five months ago?

06:48.901 --> 06:50.500
Joanna Masters won a charity auction

06:50.536 --> 06:52.703
to have me come to her home
and do a private reading

06:52.771 --> 06:54.304
of "Driving Heat," my latest novel,

06:54.373 --> 06:56.215
due to come out
the following day.

06:57.271 --> 06:58.742
Oh, my!

06:58.811 --> 07:00.844
Richard Castle... In my home.

07:00.913 --> 07:02.279
It is a pleasure to meet you.

07:02.348 --> 07:04.208
Oh, I just adore your books.

07:04.261 --> 07:05.897
I mean, Nikki Heat
is, like, my role model.

07:05.971 --> 07:08.452
- I love her.
- Me, too. You are too kind.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.354
- And you are too cute.
- Keep talking.

07:10.422 --> 07:13.090
Please come in, come in.

07:13.192 --> 07:14.391
Oh.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.059
Like you to meet
my husband, Roger.

07:16.161 --> 07:17.160
- Richard.
- Nice to meet you.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.195
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.499
And, uh...
These are the Beakmans.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.412
That's when I met Sadie Beakman.

07:21.531 --> 07:24.328
Sadie, Lloyd, and
their lovely daughter, Annie.

07:24.354 --> 07:25.902
- Richard. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:25.971 --> 07:27.938
I'm sure you recognize Sadie

07:28.040 --> 07:29.639
from her Iraq war news reports,

07:29.708 --> 07:32.275
but she also owns and operates
beakmanreport.com.

07:32.344 --> 07:34.277
After meeting
the soon-to-be victim,

07:34.346 --> 07:35.912
I met the soon-to-be killer.

07:35.981 --> 07:38.048
Champagne?

07:38.117 --> 07:39.616
Thank you so much
for being here.

07:39.718 --> 07:40.984
Thank you for having me.

07:41.053 --> 07:43.420
Sorry about the small poster.
I ran out of the big ones.

07:44.823 --> 07:47.958
"Driving Heat," written by... this guy.

07:49.714 --> 07:52.095
"The last thing Nikki Heat expected

07:52.131 --> 07:54.664
when she received her promotion
up to captain of the NYPD..."

07:54.733 --> 07:57.634
After the reading,
I needed to use the restroom.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.805
Sorry, I'm gonna be a while.

08:01.907 --> 08:04.741
So I went to use
the facilities upstairs.

08:04.843 --> 08:06.243
Stop!

08:07.004 --> 08:10.540
That's when I saw the defendant
kill Sadie Beakman.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.116
Let the record reflect
the witness has identified

08:13.185 --> 08:16.987
the defendant, Nina O'Keefe,
as the woman in question.

08:17.479 --> 08:19.456
Nothing further, Your Honor.

08:19.931 --> 08:21.620
Mr. Brown, your witness.

08:21.778 --> 08:24.161
Mr. Castle, I-i don't want to
take up too much of your time.

08:24.263 --> 08:25.996
I only have
a handful of questions.

08:26.098 --> 08:28.131
First... is it possible

08:28.200 --> 08:30.233
that my client did not kill
Mrs. Beakman?

08:30.335 --> 08:31.868
Oh, no. It was definitely her.

08:31.904 --> 08:35.294
And you remember the events
of the evening clearly?

08:35.360 --> 08:38.010
Because I know that you have
a history of memory loss.

08:38.104 --> 08:41.311
Objection, Your Honor.
Goes to credibility.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.145
I'll allow it.

08:43.215 --> 08:47.083
Mr. Castle, is it true
that on may 12, 2014,

08:47.152 --> 08:49.779
you were abducted
by parties still unknown

08:49.884 --> 08:52.556
and then returned 8 weeks later?

08:52.658 --> 08:53.790
Yes.

08:53.859 --> 08:55.158
And you still have memory loss?

08:55.227 --> 08:57.527
Only of those eight weeks.

08:57.596 --> 09:00.931
My memory of your client killing
Mrs. Beakman is crystal clear.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.599
But how can you be sure?

09:02.701 --> 09:04.468
Because I was an eyewitness.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.303
Ah. So glad
that you used that word.

09:06.405 --> 09:07.904
Eyewitness.

09:08.006 --> 09:13.176
Now, Mr. Castle, you gave
a reading of "Driving Heat"

09:13.278 --> 09:14.711
on the evening in question,

09:14.813 --> 09:16.655
the continuing adventures of Nikki Heat.

09:16.734 --> 09:19.228
Might you humor the court and
just give us a short reading?

09:19.281 --> 09:22.605
Just the highlighted section,
if you please.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.394
"Nikki had seen it often,
as every cop had.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.161
Otherwise-reliable eyewitnesses

09:31.230 --> 09:33.997
conflate or confuse details
that seem indelible

09:34.032 --> 09:37.100
to those not caught up
in the trauma of the incident."

09:37.169 --> 09:39.269
According to previous testimony,

09:39.338 --> 09:41.638
you use your expertise
with the NYPD

09:41.707 --> 09:43.974
to add authenticity
to your stories.

09:44.076 --> 09:45.509
Is that correct?

09:45.577 --> 09:47.644
The defendant killed Mrs. Beakman.

09:47.746 --> 09:48.912
I know what I saw.

09:48.981 --> 09:53.185
Just like you knew what you saw
on February 2, 2015?

09:54.610 --> 09:57.153
Mr. Castle, did you give a statement

09:57.256 --> 09:59.789
to a Detective Neely
of Westchester P.D.

09:59.858 --> 10:02.359
That you were an eyewitness
to the murder of Eva Whitfield

10:02.394 --> 10:04.012
and that her husband, Cole, was the killer?

10:04.091 --> 10:04.738
Yes, I did...

10:04.777 --> 10:07.631
- And was Cole Whitfield the killer?
- No.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.599
So you've been wrong before.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.368
That incident was a setup.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.003
What happened to Mrs. Beakman
was not.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.604
I saw the defendant kill her.

10:14.673 --> 10:17.720
Says the man whose own writings

10:17.786 --> 10:20.847
speak to the unreliability
of eyewitnesses,

10:20.900 --> 10:23.842
a man who has given false
eyewitness statements in the past,

10:23.894 --> 10:27.760
a man with a history
of memory loss.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.988
- Marcus... Help him.
- Don't you think I would if I could?

10:32.057 --> 10:34.157
Mr. Castle, let's pretend

10:34.226 --> 10:36.493
that you're a character out
of one of your novels.

10:36.562 --> 10:38.828
Would Nikki Heat think that
you were a reliable witness?

10:38.897 --> 10:41.765
That is a ridiculous question,
and yes, she would.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.366
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Castle.

10:43.502 --> 10:44.701
I thought you of all people

10:44.770 --> 10:46.475
would be sympathetic to my client.

10:46.594 --> 10:49.826
Weren't you once framed
for murder?

10:50.974 --> 10:55.090
That... yeah, that was 3XK,
the serial killer.

10:55.156 --> 10:56.780
He had a vendetta against me.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.615
That... that was...
That was different.

10:58.684 --> 11:01.518
W-why is it different for you
but not for my client?

11:01.772 --> 11:04.621
What makes you so special,
Mr. Castle?

11:04.675 --> 11:07.457
Dr. parish testified
that the victim, Mrs. Beakman,

11:07.559 --> 11:10.627
was alive for 5 to 10 minutes
after being stabbed

11:10.729 --> 11:13.252
and in excruciating pain.

11:13.383 --> 11:16.866
Might it be that my client
simply came across the victim

11:16.969 --> 11:19.536
after the true killer
stabbed her and fled?

11:19.638 --> 11:22.205
But that... this is not
one of your stories, sir!

11:22.307 --> 11:24.649
You do not get to make up
the facts as you see fit.

11:24.689 --> 11:26.876
Now, my client is fighting
for her life

11:26.945 --> 11:29.245
just as you once fought
for yours against 3XK.

11:29.348 --> 11:33.650
So, now I ask you one last time,
is it possible, Mr. Castle,

11:33.752 --> 11:37.887
that my client did not kill
Mrs. Beakman?

11:41.226 --> 11:43.460
- Yes, it's possible.
- Yes.

11:43.595 --> 11:47.097
Yes, it is possible.
Possible that you are wrong.

11:47.163 --> 11:49.666
Nothing further, Your Honor.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.940
Mr. Castle, you may step down.

11:58.279 --> 12:00.285
S08E10
Witness for the Prosecution

12:00.377 --> 12:03.046
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

12:04.360 --> 12:06.553
Mr. Castle, you may step down.

12:10.154 --> 12:11.619
Mr. Castle.

12:12.014 --> 12:13.518
Step down.

12:18.873 --> 12:20.247
It's nearly 5:00.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.778
We will pick this back up
in the morning.

12:21.830 --> 12:23.941
Court is in recess
until 9:00 A.M.

12:35.370 --> 12:36.822
Come here.

12:36.925 --> 12:38.824
Marcus, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

12:38.927 --> 12:40.528
- I got torpedoed.
- No, no, no, no.

12:40.607 --> 12:41.961
You got nuked.

12:44.098 --> 12:44.997
Are you okay?

12:45.099 --> 12:47.044
Beckett, I just blew
the entire case.

12:47.268 --> 12:49.630
Well, the trial's not over yet,
right, Marcus?

12:49.696 --> 12:52.038
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
We got a serious problem now.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.774
Castle, you've just given
the jury reasonable doubt.

12:54.876 --> 12:56.839
But there's got to be
something we can do, right?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.344
Well, we have until
court resumes tomorrow morning

12:58.413 --> 12:59.745
to find new evidence

12:59.847 --> 13:01.781
or another witness
who can prove Nina's guilt.

13:01.883 --> 13:04.083
Yes. However,
what can you possibly uncover

13:04.152 --> 13:05.217
in less than 16 hours?

13:05.320 --> 13:07.970
I don't know.
But we have to try.

13:10.091 --> 13:12.558
How many more times do we
have to go through these case files?

13:12.660 --> 13:14.160
As many as it takes.

13:14.262 --> 13:16.529
Beckett, we got stacks and stacks
of hay here but no needles.

13:16.631 --> 13:18.722
I think we need a new strategy.

13:18.906 --> 13:21.400
I can't believe
how badly I blew it out there.

13:21.469 --> 13:23.235
This is my fault, guys.
I'm sorry.

13:23.338 --> 13:24.804
Don't do that to yourself.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.038
We've all been tripped up
on the witness stand.

13:27.117 --> 13:28.911
True. Back when I
was in uniform,

13:29.003 --> 13:31.177
a defense attorney
got my head so turned around

13:31.279 --> 13:33.412
that I testified the defendant
actually kicked my ass

13:33.514 --> 13:34.832
when I tried to arrest her.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.481
What's wrong with that?

13:37.885 --> 13:41.320
The defendant was a 75-year-old
woman in a wheelchair.

13:41.422 --> 13:43.196
I lost all credibility with the jury.

13:43.394 --> 13:47.059
To this day, we pass the park
where she feeds the birds,

13:47.161 --> 13:49.210
she snickers, turns to her
nurse, and tells her the tale

13:49.276 --> 13:51.163
of how she got one over
on poor old Javi.

13:51.299 --> 13:54.667
Ms. Lucinda...
I will get her one day.

13:56.170 --> 14:00.306
But have any of you botched your
testimony in a murder trial?

14:04.013 --> 14:05.438
Exactly.

14:05.728 --> 14:07.413
Hey, Espo,
that story about Ms. Lucinda...

14:07.515 --> 14:10.516
So she still talks about
how she made a fool out of you.

14:10.618 --> 14:13.319
Yes. Thank you for rubbing it
in, Captain Beckett.

14:13.421 --> 14:15.421
You guys,
we're approaching this wrong.

14:15.523 --> 14:18.290
I mean, we've been trying to
find a clue from the murder,

14:18.393 --> 14:21.627
whereas we should be looking for
a clue from after the murder.

14:21.729 --> 14:25.009
Yes. Nina's been held
since her arrest.

14:25.101 --> 14:27.208
She might've confessed something
to a cellmate.

14:27.274 --> 14:29.368
- Let's bring Nina's cellmate in.
- Mm.

14:31.272 --> 14:32.605
Hey, thank you.

14:32.707 --> 14:33.606
For what?

14:33.708 --> 14:35.141
For not giving up on me.

14:35.243 --> 14:37.777
Well, you've never given up
on me, so...

14:39.414 --> 14:40.646
Castle, wait.

14:40.748 --> 14:41.647
Uh, not here.

14:41.749 --> 14:43.959
Oh, right. Separated. Oh.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.918
Are you okay?
Do you have allergies?

14:46.020 --> 14:48.220
No, that's the...
That's the signal. That's the...

14:48.289 --> 14:51.157
Oh, yes. You really should think
of something better.

14:51.259 --> 14:53.325
- It's adorable.
- Mnh-mnh.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.296
Damn.
That's a good photo of Nina.

14:57.494 --> 14:59.895
You know, in my mug shot,
I look like a train wreck.

15:00.013 --> 15:01.333
Probably because I was
high on crack at the time.

15:01.402 --> 15:02.635
Just answer the question.

15:02.704 --> 15:04.904
Has Nina revealed anything
about the murder?

15:04.972 --> 15:08.607
Yep. Between the three of us,
she's guilty as hell.

15:09.385 --> 15:10.994
What do you know?

15:15.717 --> 15:18.317
Okay, Bridget,
what do you want?

15:18.386 --> 15:20.219
Oh, what does any girl want, Detective?

15:20.254 --> 15:22.755
The personal satisfaction
of bringing a killer to justice?

15:22.790 --> 15:25.491
50 bucks in my prison commissary
every week for the next 10 weeks.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.226
40 bucks for 5 weeks.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.095
Eight, and that's as low
as I'll go.

15:29.130 --> 15:31.097
Deal. But you better have
some solid information.

15:31.165 --> 15:34.439
Now, has Nina confessed
to the murder?

15:34.531 --> 15:35.336
No.

15:35.441 --> 15:37.069
But I know she did it.

15:37.138 --> 15:39.038
Look, here's the deal with Nina.

15:39.107 --> 15:40.940
She's a mouse.
Doesn't talk much.

15:40.975 --> 15:42.408
Then one day she lets slip
she's worried

15:42.443 --> 15:44.076
the prosecution might find out
about her secret.

15:44.145 --> 15:46.879
- What secret?
- Didn't say.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.982
I think it has to do
with her boyfriend or something.

15:50.235 --> 15:51.726
What boyfriend?

15:53.401 --> 15:54.720
If Nina has a secret boyfriend
out there,

15:54.789 --> 15:56.956
- there's a chance she confessed to him.
- Yeah.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.624
No, I'm just
trying to figure out

15:58.659 --> 16:00.805
who Nina was dating
when she was arrested.

16:01.121 --> 16:03.662
Am I working with the police?
No. No, no.

16:03.731 --> 16:05.898
I went to high school with Nina.

16:05.967 --> 16:09.602
What school? Uh... Taft?

16:09.704 --> 16:11.403
Hello? Uh...

16:11.506 --> 16:12.605
None of Nina's people

16:12.673 --> 16:13.839
are gonna help us
build a case against her.

16:13.908 --> 16:15.541
We're gonna have to
figure out a different way

16:15.610 --> 16:17.109
to identify Nina's boyfriend.

16:17.178 --> 16:19.011
I just did. Follow me.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.880
So, I went through
Nina's financials.

16:20.982 --> 16:23.182
It turns out
the night before the murder,

16:23.251 --> 16:25.751
Nina bought drinks
at a bar on the East Village.

16:25.853 --> 16:28.354
Now, that bar went out
of business.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.523
However, the hotel next door

16:30.558 --> 16:33.547
had surveillance footage
from that night.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.794
Look.

16:34.829 --> 16:38.097
Now, bear in mind, this is the
night before Nina killed Sadie.

16:38.547 --> 16:40.800
There's Nina.
Is Nina's boyfriend in this?

16:40.902 --> 16:43.569
Not her boyfriend. Wait for it.

16:43.671 --> 16:45.671
Her girlfriend.

16:46.707 --> 16:47.835
Sadie!

16:47.953 --> 16:49.441
Yep.

16:53.114 --> 16:55.915
The victim and
the killer were having an affair?!

16:56.227 --> 16:58.584
Why is my voice so high?

17:06.555 --> 17:07.921
You see, Beckett?

17:07.990 --> 17:10.490
This is why I love
the 12th precinct.

17:10.559 --> 17:11.825
You guys never let me down.

17:11.894 --> 17:14.127
This recording gives you
new motive for murder,

17:14.195 --> 17:15.161
and it's ironclad.

17:15.230 --> 17:17.196
Nina and Sadie
were having an affair.

17:17.232 --> 17:18.932
Clearly, they were fighting,

17:18.967 --> 17:21.800
and Nina most likely killed her
in a crime of passion.

17:21.837 --> 17:23.670
Okay. I will have
my people track down

17:23.771 --> 17:25.137
former employees of this bar,

17:25.207 --> 17:27.707
and hopefully one of them
can corroborate the affair.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.009
Okay, and I'll have my team

17:29.077 --> 17:30.710
touch base with Sadie's
family and friends.

17:30.746 --> 17:33.877
Maybe they can shed some light as to
what was behind this little love affair.

17:36.952 --> 17:40.620
You see, Marcus?
And you were worried.

17:43.825 --> 17:46.660
Okay, boys,
we found Nina's coffin.

17:46.728 --> 17:48.295
Now let's nail it shut.

17:48.363 --> 17:50.163
I'll talk to Nina's employees.

17:50.265 --> 17:52.666
I'll go talk with her friends.

17:56.447 --> 17:59.105
Sadie was having an affair
with that woman?

17:59.174 --> 18:00.507
That is so twisted.

18:00.575 --> 18:03.109
Well, you never know what
goes on behind closed doors.

18:03.145 --> 18:05.578
So you knew nothing about
Sadie's extramarital affairs?

18:05.614 --> 18:07.347
She was good at keeping secrets.

18:07.382 --> 18:10.116
Then why hire the catering
company that Nina worked for?

18:10.185 --> 18:11.200
Sadie's recommendation.

18:11.239 --> 18:12.730
She went to an event
that they catered,

18:12.783 --> 18:14.089
said the food was amazing.

18:14.129 --> 18:17.506
I bet that's
how Sadie and Nina met.

18:17.585 --> 18:19.023
What do you think, Richard?

18:19.195 --> 18:20.493
Entirely possible.

18:20.529 --> 18:23.997
See! I told you I was a Nikki Heat fan.
I even think like her, too.

18:24.066 --> 18:25.956
- It's uncanny.
- I know.

18:26.035 --> 18:28.317
It's good that you moved the basketball
hoop away from the townhouse.

18:28.370 --> 18:31.237
Oh, yeah, those things, they're just an
invitation for burglars to break in.

18:31.306 --> 18:33.406
Or murderers like Nina
to break out.

18:33.475 --> 18:36.176
Well, we always keep
the hoop there. Nina moved it.

18:36.228 --> 18:39.779
Yeah, we didn't even realize that she
had until the day after the murder.

18:39.848 --> 18:41.648
How are you sure
it was Nina that moved it?

18:41.717 --> 18:43.920
Well, if it wasn't her,

18:43.972 --> 18:46.686
who else could it have been?

18:47.416 --> 18:48.822
Ryan, a moment?

18:48.890 --> 18:50.323
Excuse us.

18:52.594 --> 18:54.194
The basketball hoop being moved

18:54.296 --> 18:55.528
speaks to a premeditative act.

18:55.564 --> 18:57.163
Yeah, but our theory
of this whole thing

18:57.232 --> 18:58.965
is a crime of passion.
What are you thinking?

18:59.034 --> 19:00.786
That we don't know
the whole story.

19:00.852 --> 19:04.716
Someone else was up here
before I caught Nina over Sadie.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.035
Please tell me you're joking.

19:06.114 --> 19:08.575
The fact the basketball hoop
was moved is significant

19:08.610 --> 19:10.942
because Nina didn't have
any reason to do it.

19:11.431 --> 19:14.014
Kate... Why am I back here?

19:14.116 --> 19:15.949
Marcus, this is
a legitimate concern.

19:16.018 --> 19:18.099
If Nina didn't move the hoop,
then who did and why?

19:18.165 --> 19:21.788
Let's stick with what we know.
Castle saw Nina kill Sadie.

19:21.890 --> 19:22.956
End of story.

19:23.025 --> 19:25.487
I'm not actually 100% sure
about that anymore.

19:25.566 --> 19:29.129
Wait. Don't tell me you're buying
into Caleb's ridiculous defense.

19:29.197 --> 19:32.130
Rick, you got your bell rung
in court today. It happens.

19:32.235 --> 19:34.200
Caleb Brown
is a hell of an attorney.

19:34.269 --> 19:35.402
Now you got to let it go.

19:35.470 --> 19:36.813
So you're not
going to investigate?

19:36.892 --> 19:39.359
You saw the tape.
They were having an affair.

19:39.412 --> 19:43.276
It's a crime of passion. Nina
is guilty, plain and simple.

19:43.345 --> 19:45.011
Don't we have to be sure?

19:45.080 --> 19:48.314
Rick, look at me. I'm sure.

19:48.383 --> 19:49.686
- Marcus, if we could just...
- Stop.

19:49.752 --> 19:51.351
This case cannot afford

19:51.420 --> 19:54.238
to have you pour any
more doubt into people's ears.

19:58.168 --> 20:00.894
Listen, I know
you two are separated and all,

20:00.929 --> 20:03.396
- but could you please talk to him?
- Mm-hmm.

20:11.907 --> 20:13.991
Castle, are you sure
that Nina's innocent?

20:14.268 --> 20:15.608
I don't know.

20:16.181 --> 20:19.096
But what's worse than letting
a guilty person go free?

20:19.677 --> 20:21.866
Sending an innocent one to jail.

20:23.080 --> 20:23.983
All right.

20:24.086 --> 20:27.104
Go home. I'll swing by later.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.782
So you don't trust
what you saw?

20:29.848 --> 20:32.125
I don't know that I can anymore.

20:32.160 --> 20:36.763
I just... keep running it
in my head over and over again.

20:36.798 --> 20:39.830
And you think Nina was just
trying to help this poor woman?

20:39.935 --> 20:41.801
Nina's back was to me.

20:41.870 --> 20:44.904
I didn't actually see
the death blow. I...

20:45.006 --> 20:46.439
You got to believe me, you guys.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.074
I-it really looked
like she did it.

20:48.143 --> 20:49.770
Mm-hmm.
Well, I believe you.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.812
It's just honestly it sounds
to me like Nina killed her.

20:52.914 --> 20:55.641
Me too. I have to
find out for sure.

20:55.733 --> 20:57.550
Dad, there's no way to do that.

20:57.619 --> 20:59.414
I know.

21:00.589 --> 21:02.086
Or is there?

21:03.036 --> 21:04.057
I've got it.

21:04.126 --> 21:05.252
And I'd only have to do two things.

21:05.318 --> 21:07.838
One, delay the trial so I have
a chance to investigate,

21:07.891 --> 21:10.997
and two, have a one-on-one
conversation with Nina.

21:11.532 --> 21:13.600
Uh, Nina's lawyer
will never allow it.

21:13.668 --> 21:15.423
Which is why I'm
going to have to be very clever

21:15.436 --> 21:16.544
with how I go about this.

21:16.584 --> 21:18.438
I take it you have a plan.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.006
You know I do, mother.

21:20.108 --> 21:21.841
Might I ask you what it is?

21:21.943 --> 21:24.177
I'm gonna get thrown in jail.

21:30.398 --> 21:31.414
Yes?

21:32.640 --> 21:34.461
Good morning, Your Honor.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.994
Mr. Castle,
you can't be in here.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.253
And yet here I am.

21:38.321 --> 21:40.622
Your Honor, I was made a fool of
yesterday on the stand.

21:40.657 --> 21:44.025
I have a reputation to protect,
so I would like... a do-over.

21:44.778 --> 21:46.348
- A do-over?
- A do-over.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.530
Okay, two things.
One... that's stupid.

21:48.598 --> 21:51.399
And two... your presence in my
chambers is highly unethical.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.489
I could hold you
in contempt of court for this.

21:53.528 --> 21:57.238
Well, I would like to...
See you try.

22:00.771 --> 22:03.378
Reggie, come in here, please.

22:04.438 --> 22:07.148
Mr. Castle, I'm aware of your
friendship with the mayor,

22:07.217 --> 22:11.226
so even though you don't deserve
it, I'm gonna let you go.

22:11.450 --> 22:14.168
Reggie, escort him out
of the building, please.

22:16.833 --> 22:19.894
Oh. Your Honor,
I see you attended law school

22:19.996 --> 22:22.230
- at Hudson University.
- Mm.

22:22.332 --> 22:23.832
That explains why
you're so bad at your job.

22:23.934 --> 22:25.600
Excuse me?

22:25.669 --> 22:27.368
Yes, you see, uh, everyone knows

22:27.437 --> 22:29.104
only criminals attend
Hudson University.

22:29.139 --> 22:32.340
I myself have solved
three homicides there.

22:34.344 --> 22:35.243
Hello?

22:35.312 --> 22:36.878
Gloria Wollcott, please.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.046
Speaking.

22:38.115 --> 22:40.915
Yes, this is
Tri-Mountain Security calling.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.485
The alarm on your
Connecticut home was triggered.

22:43.553 --> 22:45.186
The officer responded,

22:45.288 --> 22:46.654
and I'm afraid the report

22:46.757 --> 22:48.823
is that your residence
was burglarized.

22:48.925 --> 22:50.825
What?! Okay, I'm on my way.

22:50.894 --> 22:53.061
My house has been burglarized.

22:53.130 --> 22:56.264
Your Honor, you know who I am
and what I'm capable of doing.

22:56.366 --> 22:57.966
I can find those burglars for you.

22:58.034 --> 23:00.034
How? Well, first I
would need a listing

23:00.070 --> 23:03.116
of all the Hudson University students
and alumnus in the tri-state area.

23:03.617 --> 23:04.539
Okay, that's it.

23:04.641 --> 23:07.298
Contempt. Have him thrown
into a holding cell.

23:21.825 --> 23:24.859
Hey, my trial was supposed
to begin like five minutes ago.

23:24.929 --> 23:25.602
What's going on?

23:25.681 --> 23:27.330
Judge postponed your trial until tomorrow.

23:27.422 --> 23:30.565
You'll be transported back
to rikers at the end of the day.

23:30.634 --> 23:31.966
Hey.

23:32.330 --> 23:33.501
So, what are you in for?

23:34.335 --> 23:35.804
Sorry, bad joke.

23:35.906 --> 23:37.752
Don't talk to me.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.976
Nina, look, I know
about the affair with Sadie.

23:42.602 --> 23:45.742
The A.D.A. knows it, too.
He is gonna use it to bury you.

23:45.847 --> 23:47.215
Why are you telling me this?

23:47.250 --> 23:51.019
I was there, Nina. I saw you.
I saw you with my own eyes.

23:51.087 --> 23:53.388
I didn't kill Sadie!
I loved her.

23:53.456 --> 23:55.657
So, yeah, you were there,
but you saw it wrong.

23:55.759 --> 23:56.958
So tell me what I missed.

23:57.060 --> 24:00.695
I found Sadie on the ground.
Someone had already stabbed her.

24:00.764 --> 24:04.265
She was struggling to breathe,
so I pulled the poker out.

24:04.334 --> 24:06.945
I was trying to help her.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.670
So then why did you run?

24:08.726 --> 24:11.105
I knew how it looked.
I panicked.

24:11.141 --> 24:13.374
Why didn't you tell that to
the police when they caught you?

24:13.410 --> 24:17.499
Please. I've been arrested
before, and I got screwed over.

24:17.565 --> 24:20.326
You know why? Because
none of the cops believed me.

24:20.444 --> 24:22.684
I wasn't gonna make
the same mistake twice.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.919
- Did you at least tell your lawyer?
- Of course.

24:24.988 --> 24:28.489
I told my original public
defender all about the affair,

24:28.525 --> 24:30.651
but he said it'd just
come across as motive.

24:30.678 --> 24:33.061
Surprise, surprise. It did.

24:33.949 --> 24:35.096
What about the fight?

24:35.165 --> 24:36.998
The fight you had with Sadie
outside the bar

24:37.067 --> 24:38.333
the night before the murder?

24:38.435 --> 24:39.868
It was nothing.

24:40.071 --> 24:41.269
Nina...

24:41.667 --> 24:43.037
Nina.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.973
I think you're telling the truth,

24:45.041 --> 24:48.543
but I can't help you unless
you tell me the whole story.

24:54.007 --> 24:55.750
The fight was
about a couple things.

24:55.852 --> 24:57.785
I was sick of sneaking around,

24:57.821 --> 25:00.355
but Sadie was all paranoid
because she had been caught

25:00.423 --> 25:01.890
cheating with other guys
in the past.

25:01.992 --> 25:03.759
Other guys?

25:04.432 --> 25:06.895
So, you were her first...

25:06.997 --> 25:08.162
Lesbian?

25:08.198 --> 25:09.664
Yes. Is that a problem?

25:09.733 --> 25:11.833
No, not with me. You should
check my source history.

25:11.902 --> 25:14.102
But you said you were arguing
about a couple of things.

25:14.170 --> 25:16.738
What really pissed me off
was that Sadie asked me

25:16.806 --> 25:18.573
to do something
at that cocktail party.

25:18.675 --> 25:19.974
What did she ask you to do?

25:20.043 --> 25:22.785
Bring her Roger Masters'
empty champagne glass.

25:23.511 --> 25:25.079
Roger Masters the host?

25:25.148 --> 25:27.882
- Why would she want his empty glass?
- She wouldn't say.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.784
And that really got me fired up

25:29.853 --> 25:31.853
because if I got caught stealing,

25:31.888 --> 25:34.422
even something as trivial
as a champagne glass,

25:34.447 --> 25:35.757
I would've lost my job.

25:35.859 --> 25:37.992
But you stole it for her anyway,
didn't you?

25:38.819 --> 25:40.929
At the end of the day,
I'd do anything for Sadie,

25:41.031 --> 25:42.355
and she knew it.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.866
She had me wrapped around her
finger the moment I met her.

25:45.152 --> 25:47.602
Walk me through it.
Tell me what happened.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.837
When Roger was done
with his champagne,

25:49.873 --> 25:53.207
I retrieved the empty glass and
quietly handed it off to Sadie.

25:53.276 --> 25:55.343
- What did she do with it?
- Went upstairs.

25:55.412 --> 25:57.445
I followed her up
like 20 minutes later

25:57.514 --> 25:58.780
to see what was going on.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.114
That's when I found her.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.283
- And you told all this to your lawyer?
- Yes.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.618
But my original public defender

26:03.653 --> 26:06.220
was too overloaded
with other cases.

26:06.517 --> 26:09.357
And, truth be told,
he thought I was guilty.

26:09.407 --> 26:12.151
He wanted me to take
the A.D.A.'S plea deal.

26:12.217 --> 26:14.329
Thank God Caleb Brown took over.

26:14.431 --> 26:16.164
At least he's fighting for me.

26:18.902 --> 26:21.204
Yo. How's it hanging, jailbird?

26:21.772 --> 26:23.304
You already pissed off the A.D.A.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.639
So, what, you figured,

26:24.674 --> 26:26.574
why the hell not piss off
the judge, as well?

26:26.643 --> 26:28.176
Yeah. Can you guys
get me out of here?

26:28.244 --> 26:30.011
Already done. Bailiff called us
to come get you.

26:35.629 --> 26:37.418
I'm gonna figure out
what happened.

26:37.621 --> 26:39.442
I promise.

26:41.758 --> 26:43.324
Are you out of your mind?

26:43.426 --> 26:44.652
I didn't do anything wrong.

26:44.705 --> 26:46.761
You tricked a judge
to postpone a trial,

26:46.830 --> 26:48.896
and then you illegally
questioned the defendant.

26:48.965 --> 26:51.599
Yeah, but other than that,
I didn't do anything wrong.

26:51.701 --> 26:54.469
Yo, Beckett, Castle's convinced
that Nina's innocent now.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.536
Because why?

26:55.605 --> 26:57.572
Because Sadie wanted
Roger's glass?

26:58.009 --> 27:00.859
I think she was after his DNA.

27:01.109 --> 27:02.176
Why?

27:02.278 --> 27:05.661
Roger was her cameraman
for 20 years.

27:06.057 --> 27:09.283
Nina said that Sadie had had
affairs with men in the past.

27:09.352 --> 27:10.518
Maybe they had had one

27:10.587 --> 27:12.920
and Sadie's daughter
was actually Roger's.

27:13.248 --> 27:16.157
So, uh, what, you think that
Sadie cooked this whole thing up

27:16.226 --> 27:18.684
so she could get a DNA sample
for a paternity test?

27:18.750 --> 27:21.797
Only one way to find out. What
do you want us to do, Captain?

27:21.890 --> 27:23.931
- I...
- Beckett. Look.

27:26.736 --> 27:29.771
Uh, go talk to Roger,
see what he knows.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.273
What is he doing here?

27:32.342 --> 27:34.776
I'll handle this.
You just be normal.

27:35.830 --> 27:37.690
Captain, you crossed the line.

27:37.783 --> 27:40.012
I know that you had Castle go in
and interview my client...

27:40.078 --> 27:42.783
Look, counselor,
Castle and I are separated.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.487
He is no longer associated
with the 12th precinct.

27:45.513 --> 27:47.088
So neither I nor the NYPD

27:47.190 --> 27:49.223
can be held accountable
for his actions.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.558
So you knew nothing about it?

27:50.660 --> 27:51.926
That's what I said, isn't it?

27:52.028 --> 27:53.070
I don't believe you.

27:53.136 --> 27:54.395
And I don't care.

27:54.497 --> 27:55.999
Typical cop.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.299
Wait.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.368
What?

28:00.708 --> 28:02.370
Look, if you repeat
what I'm about to tell you,

28:02.439 --> 28:03.923
I will deny it.

28:05.208 --> 28:07.675
I have people
looking into Nina's case.

28:09.042 --> 28:10.388
Do you believe
that she's innocent?

28:10.427 --> 28:13.281
I didn't say that, but I think
we have to be thorough.

28:13.349 --> 28:14.964
And now that the trial
has been postponed,

28:15.004 --> 28:17.718
we have time
to investigate further.

28:17.814 --> 28:19.587
I appreciate that, captain.

28:20.321 --> 28:22.924
Counselor, Nina wasn't your
client until yesterday morning.

28:23.026 --> 28:25.493
Why are you so passionate
about this case?

28:25.528 --> 28:28.429
For the same
reason that I assume you are.

28:28.531 --> 28:29.530
Justice.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.033
This is Caleb Brown.

28:32.135 --> 28:33.723
Yes.

28:36.139 --> 28:37.438
Yeah?

28:38.575 --> 28:40.847
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.

28:41.006 --> 28:42.105
So, while the judge
was heading home,

28:42.171 --> 28:43.911
she called a neighbor,
who checked on her house.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.913
Turns out, the house
was not burglarized.

28:45.982 --> 28:48.028
Anyway, she's ordered that the
trial resume in a half an hour.

28:48.081 --> 28:50.952
So if your people are going to
help prove Nina's innocence,

28:51.087 --> 28:52.954
they'd better hurry.

29:00.367 --> 29:01.300
You again.

29:01.368 --> 29:03.071
Hello, Roger. We need to talk.

29:03.137 --> 29:04.456
Now what?

29:04.509 --> 29:05.871
Joanna.

29:05.973 --> 29:08.440
Well, hello!

29:08.509 --> 29:10.386
Sorry for the interruption.
This won't take long.

29:10.465 --> 29:13.212
It actually can't. Trial's gonna
start again in a few minutes.

29:13.247 --> 29:15.447
And we need to nail down
who the real killer is

29:15.516 --> 29:17.116
before an innocent woman
gets convicted.

29:17.184 --> 29:19.284
What do you mean innocent?
You saw that woman kill Sadie.

29:19.353 --> 29:21.020
No, Roger, I only thought I did.

29:21.088 --> 29:22.955
You see,
the mind is a funny thing.

29:22.990 --> 29:25.391
Doesn't like a vacuum.
So it fills in the blanks.

29:25.426 --> 29:27.893
Much like when I discovered Sadie
and Nina were having an affair,

29:27.928 --> 29:30.617
I automatically assumed Nina
killed her in a lover's quarrel

29:30.723 --> 29:32.464
when really the two of them
were working together

29:32.500 --> 29:33.866
to get something
from you, Roger.

29:35.369 --> 29:36.902
What is he talking about?

29:37.004 --> 29:38.771
I'm sure I have no idea.

29:38.839 --> 29:40.005
- May I?
- Please.

29:40.041 --> 29:42.441
Turns out that Sadie asked Nina
to bring her a glass

29:42.510 --> 29:43.742
with your DNA on it.

29:43.811 --> 29:45.344
The question is why.

29:45.413 --> 29:46.812
- My turn?
- Go for it.

29:46.847 --> 29:49.715
We think that you were
having an affair with Sadie.

29:50.933 --> 29:52.251
I knew it!

29:52.286 --> 29:53.704
All those years
you were working together,

29:53.756 --> 29:55.788
your little
secret conversations.

29:55.801 --> 29:57.956
You were cheating on me
this whole time, weren't you?

29:57.992 --> 29:59.525
Honey, it's not true. I swear.

29:59.627 --> 30:01.839
See, Sadie wanted
a sample of your DNA

30:01.879 --> 30:05.197
to prove that you are
the father of Sadie's daughter.

30:05.266 --> 30:06.665
Oh.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.600
Oh, for the love of God.

30:08.669 --> 30:11.637
I told you. I don't understand.

30:11.739 --> 30:14.899
Roger is infertile...

30:14.979 --> 30:18.343
Due to a childhood illness,
and Sadie knew that.

30:18.412 --> 30:21.680
Hell, the mailman probably knows it,
given how much Roger talks about it.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.249
It was a very traumatic experience.

30:24.318 --> 30:26.351
As is this.
I'd like you to leave.

30:26.387 --> 30:29.707
Sorry, Roger. No can do.
Sadie wanted your glass.

30:29.747 --> 30:33.826
- If not for DNA, then why?
- Perhaps a fingerprint.

30:33.861 --> 30:36.028
Why would Sadie need
his fingerprint?

30:36.699 --> 30:38.831
I have no idea.

30:38.933 --> 30:40.499
Your wife does.

30:43.404 --> 30:45.204
Right over there.
Behind the picture.

30:45.306 --> 30:46.939
Joanna, how could you?

30:47.270 --> 30:49.741
Oh, please, I've been dying
to know what you've been hiding

30:49.810 --> 30:51.543
in your safe for years now,
Roger.

30:51.612 --> 30:53.412
And the fact that
you didn't knock up Sadie

30:53.514 --> 30:55.247
doesn't mean
you weren't knocking boots.

30:55.282 --> 30:57.783
If you think I'm opening that
without a warrant, you're crazy.

30:57.852 --> 30:59.051
How long would it take
to get us a warrant?

30:59.153 --> 31:00.607
An hour or two.

31:00.739 --> 31:02.588
We don't have that kind of time.

31:03.047 --> 31:05.891
- Joanna, you're a fan of Nikki heat.
- Yeah, so?

31:05.960 --> 31:08.899
So, how would you like to have a main
character named after you in my next book?

31:08.952 --> 31:11.196
Joanna, don't you dare.

31:13.912 --> 31:15.267
How about a villain?

31:15.336 --> 31:16.735
Deal.

31:23.344 --> 31:24.828
You wouldn't.

31:49.876 --> 31:52.437
What are we gonna find
on this tape, Roger?

31:56.974 --> 31:58.076
Said it's here, right?

31:58.179 --> 32:00.679
Yeah,
but you know how they lie.

32:11.058 --> 32:13.192
Here. Found something.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.160
Tell me that's not a WMD.

32:21.202 --> 32:23.569
- Whoa. You know what that is?
- Yeah.

32:23.604 --> 32:24.836
One of the $5-million duffel bags

32:24.905 --> 32:26.838
the CIA's handing out all over Iraq.

32:26.907 --> 32:28.240
Let's take it.

32:28.309 --> 32:29.208
What? No.

32:29.310 --> 32:30.576
Sadie, come on.

32:30.611 --> 32:33.045
It's 5 million bucks, and
no one's ever gonna miss it.

32:33.147 --> 32:35.691
Roger, forget about it.
We're reporters, not thieves.

32:35.783 --> 32:38.810
I'll notify JSOC
when we get back to base.

32:43.097 --> 32:45.123
All right,
let's get out of here.

32:45.192 --> 32:46.892
But you didn't leave it,
did you?

32:46.994 --> 32:48.527
You can see on the tape
that we did.

32:48.596 --> 32:51.363
Sure, and then once you stopped
recording, you went back to get it.

32:51.432 --> 32:53.332
Over a billion dollars
in cash went missing

32:53.400 --> 32:54.866
during the Iraq invasion.

32:54.935 --> 32:56.301
What's a lousy $5 mil?

32:56.337 --> 32:57.769
You couldn't just leave it,
could you?

32:57.805 --> 32:59.838
Yeah, that's exactly what I did.

33:00.874 --> 33:03.271
Except Sadie didn't, did she?

33:04.211 --> 33:06.011
No. She didn't.

33:06.490 --> 33:07.813
She snuck back
and took it for herself,

33:07.848 --> 33:10.382
and then she smuggled it to
the states, tried to cut me out.

33:10.451 --> 33:12.351
But you had the tape,
and you used that

33:12.386 --> 33:14.195
to blackmail her
so you could get your share.

33:14.234 --> 33:16.688
But Sadie didn't like
you having all that leverage.

33:16.757 --> 33:18.390
What I can't figure out is,

33:18.459 --> 33:21.132
what took Sadie so long to try
to get this tape back from you?

33:22.930 --> 33:25.030
Oh, I get it.
You burned through the money

33:25.099 --> 33:26.937
that Sadie gave you originally,
so you needed more.

33:26.990 --> 33:29.401
I am mortgaged to the hilt, okay?

33:29.436 --> 33:32.371
All my credit cards are maxed,
and my wife won't stop spending.

33:32.439 --> 33:35.841
Hell, she forked over 15 g's
to that stupid charity auction

33:35.909 --> 33:37.142
to have the great Richard Castle

33:37.211 --> 33:38.777
read a couple of chapters out
of his novel.

33:38.846 --> 33:41.280
Okay, so you went to Sadie
demanding more money,

33:41.315 --> 33:44.116
she refused, and then when
you caught her in your office

33:44.184 --> 33:46.385
that night trying to take
what was yours...

33:46.453 --> 33:48.745
You grabbed the fireplace poker
and you killed her.

33:48.811 --> 33:51.490
No! I didn't even know Sadie
was trying to steal the tape

33:51.558 --> 33:53.325
until you guys showed up
at my house earlier.

33:53.394 --> 33:55.922
Prove it. Where were you
at the time of the murder?

33:57.798 --> 33:59.819
Do you promise
not to tell my wife?

34:01.600 --> 34:02.501
I was in the basement

34:02.569 --> 34:04.870
getting baked with chip Evans
and Lester Davis.

34:04.905 --> 34:07.406
I lied because I promised my
wife that I would stop toking.

34:07.474 --> 34:11.510
It's just... I'm under
a lot of stress lately.

34:14.346 --> 34:16.148
Please tell me you solved it.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.482
Roger's alibi checks out.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.650
We're back to square one
with zero leads.

34:19.753 --> 34:20.752
Any luck with Weller?

34:20.821 --> 34:22.120
All he cares about
is getting a conviction,

34:22.222 --> 34:24.022
and from the look of the jury
when they found out

34:24.091 --> 34:25.824
about Nina and Sadie's affair,
he's gonna get it.

34:25.926 --> 34:28.376
We need to figure something out.

34:28.996 --> 34:30.594
I have an idea.

34:30.664 --> 34:32.130
Castle, what are you doing?

34:32.232 --> 34:34.339
Saving an innocent woman's life.

34:35.235 --> 34:37.636
- Mr. Brown, your witness.
- Stop the trial!

34:43.444 --> 34:47.279
Okay, so... Now what?

34:47.380 --> 34:49.514
I don't know. I didn't think
this one all the way through.

34:49.616 --> 34:50.748
Mm.

34:53.685 --> 34:55.746
Hello, Your Honor.
Nice to see you again.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.241
Hoping to make another visit to
the holding cells, Mr. Castle?

34:58.323 --> 35:00.256
No, Your Honor.
Once was plenty, thank you.

35:00.291 --> 35:02.425
And my sincerest apologies
for the interruption.

35:02.493 --> 35:04.660
However, there has been
a development in the case.

35:04.729 --> 35:06.696
Excuse us, Your Honor,

35:06.764 --> 35:09.971
but the defense has a witness
to call to the stand.

35:11.235 --> 35:13.536
Uh, Your Honor,
the defense would like to call

35:13.605 --> 35:15.104
Richard Castle to the stand.

35:19.744 --> 35:21.377
So, Nina definitely didn't do it.

35:21.479 --> 35:24.000
Tell me something I don't know,
like who did.

35:24.304 --> 35:25.314
No idea.

35:25.383 --> 35:26.849
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

35:26.918 --> 35:29.185
- and nothing but the truth?
- I do.

35:29.287 --> 35:32.129
Looks like I got my do-over
after all.

35:35.193 --> 35:36.392
Um...

35:36.799 --> 35:38.561
Mr. Castle, yesterday, you testified

35:38.630 --> 35:41.197
that my client was guilty
of killing Mrs. Beakman.

35:41.299 --> 35:43.132
Do you still believe that's true?

35:43.234 --> 35:45.001
No. Nina's innocent.

35:47.842 --> 35:49.438
Okay, and when, may I ask,

35:49.507 --> 35:51.440
did you change your mind
about my client?

35:51.542 --> 35:54.161
When I realized
that Nina was a victim.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.511
Victim of bad timing.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.046
First and foremost, my own.

35:57.115 --> 35:59.100
Bad timing, you say?

35:59.192 --> 36:00.578
It was my bad timing

36:00.657 --> 36:02.318
that brought me
to the crime scene too late.

36:02.387 --> 36:03.619
Had I gotten there earlier,

36:03.688 --> 36:07.095
I would've seen Nina
finding Sadie already stabbed.

36:07.398 --> 36:09.883
Okay, but then my client ran.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.574
- Why?
- Because she knew how it looked.

36:12.746 --> 36:14.474
While we're on the topic of bad timing,

36:14.527 --> 36:16.281
let's not fail to mention the timing

36:16.374 --> 36:18.326
of Nina originally being paired
with a public defender

36:18.379 --> 36:20.820
who didn't care about the truth,
unlike you, sir.

36:22.078 --> 36:25.041
Um...
Well, Mr. Castle, is there anything...

36:25.109 --> 36:26.616
Is there anything else you'd like
to share with the court?

36:26.669 --> 36:29.945
Yes. Good people of the jury, it
is frightening to think about,

36:30.014 --> 36:31.747
but Nina O'Keefe is on trial today

36:31.783 --> 36:33.883
simply because
I needed to use the restroom

36:33.951 --> 36:36.318
and the one downstairs...

36:39.801 --> 36:41.094
Bad timing.

36:42.915 --> 36:45.327
The bathroom downstairs
was occupied.

36:47.432 --> 36:49.298
Call 911!

36:49.367 --> 36:51.400
Call 911!

36:51.502 --> 36:54.170
I was rushing through
to the back of the house,

36:54.272 --> 36:57.506
thinking Nina was the killer
and that she was getting away,

36:57.575 --> 37:00.443
but the true killer never left.

37:00.545 --> 37:02.178
The true killer...

37:02.246 --> 37:05.881
Was still in that bathroom,
cleaning the mud from his shoes,

37:05.983 --> 37:10.286
the mud he collected
trudging through the backyard...

37:11.622 --> 37:14.323
to and from killing Sadie.

37:14.392 --> 37:15.858
Mr. Castle, did you see this man?

37:15.927 --> 37:18.260
Yeah. Talk about bad timing.

37:18.329 --> 37:20.994
He came out just in time
for me to catch him.

37:21.429 --> 37:24.300
Can you point to this man
in this courtroom?

37:24.402 --> 37:25.835
The man who killed Sadie Beakman?

37:25.903 --> 37:27.670
Yes, I can.

37:28.971 --> 37:31.173
It was her husband,
Lloyd Beakman.

37:33.578 --> 37:35.077
How dare you.

37:35.146 --> 37:37.580
Wait, you and mom
disappeared from the party

37:37.682 --> 37:39.515
at the same time.

37:39.550 --> 37:42.418
No, I-I remember because
I was trying to find you guys.

37:42.453 --> 37:44.386
All right, that's enough.
I want order.

37:44.489 --> 37:46.688
Apologies to the court, Your Honor.

37:46.768 --> 37:48.991
Joanna Masters thought that Sadie

37:49.060 --> 37:51.127
was having an affair
with her husband, Roger,

37:51.262 --> 37:53.395
but she was wrong,
and so were you.

37:53.464 --> 37:56.244
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

37:56.376 --> 37:57.392
Sure, you do.

37:57.537 --> 37:59.468
You saw your wife head
up those stairs.

37:59.537 --> 38:02.404
You had your suspicions.
She had cheated on you before.

38:02.507 --> 38:04.806
So you headed out to the yard,

38:05.030 --> 38:06.208
you moved
the basketball hoop over

38:06.277 --> 38:08.778
so you could climb up it
and get a better look.

38:08.846 --> 38:11.890
But Sadie caught you spying
in the window, didn't she?

38:12.259 --> 38:13.130
So you came inside

38:13.222 --> 38:15.294
and accused her
of having an affair with Roger.

38:15.386 --> 38:17.299
Dad, what did you do?

38:17.470 --> 38:18.888
What did I do?

38:18.990 --> 38:21.924
Your mother
was having an affair with...

38:22.453 --> 38:24.727
Her, of all people.

38:24.796 --> 38:28.063
And it was so funny to your mother
that I assumed it was Roger.

38:28.166 --> 38:29.632
She laughed and laughed.

38:29.700 --> 38:32.101
So you were upstairs with Sadie.

38:33.310 --> 38:34.303
W-w-w-what I meant was...

38:34.372 --> 38:36.539
What happened, Lloyd?
Did you lose control?

38:36.607 --> 38:38.587
Is that why you killed her?

38:41.358 --> 38:44.847
I didn't
mean to. I didn't mean it.

38:44.949 --> 38:46.148
I loved Sadie, but I just...

38:46.250 --> 38:47.716
Mr. Beakman, my advice to you

38:47.852 --> 38:50.961
would be to stop talking
and find yourself an attorney.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.489
Mr. Beakman,
you're under arrest for murder.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.691
Come on. Hands.

38:59.517 --> 39:01.463
Your Honor,
in light of these developments,

39:01.532 --> 39:03.599
the people file a motion
to dismiss all charges

39:03.701 --> 39:05.668
against Nina O'Keefe.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.881
Granted. Case dismissed.

39:07.987 --> 39:09.359
Thank you.

39:13.144 --> 39:15.010
Great job, guys. You should be
proud of yourselves.

39:15.079 --> 39:16.412
- Why? We blew it.
- Yeah.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.014
For five months, we had an
innocent woman rotting in jail.

39:19.083 --> 39:20.649
No, that one's not on us.

39:20.767 --> 39:22.971
Nina's original defense attorney
did that to her.

39:23.037 --> 39:25.730
At the end of the day, we're the
ones who brought her justice.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.623
Speaking of which,
I got to take back

39:27.658 --> 39:29.825
everything bad I've ever said
about defense attorneys.

39:29.927 --> 39:31.403
That guy Caleb Brown,
he's all right.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.529
Yeah. He's a stand-up guy.

39:33.712 --> 39:34.797
- We'll see you later, Beckett.
- Yeah.

39:34.866 --> 39:36.899
Okay, goodnight, guys.

39:39.303 --> 39:43.171
Caleb's a "stand-up guy."
If they only knew.

39:43.329 --> 39:44.622
No, they're right.

39:45.018 --> 39:47.843
I mean, Caleb is a monster,
but what we learned today

39:47.912 --> 39:51.205
is that he is a monster
who is desperate to do good.

39:51.443 --> 39:52.081
So?

39:52.149 --> 39:54.511
So, we were looking
for his weakness.

39:54.775 --> 39:57.044
And we just found it.

39:59.432 --> 40:02.097
Hey. Celebratory champagne.

40:02.321 --> 40:04.089
Felt appropriate,
given the twist it played

40:04.155 --> 40:05.294
in today's courtroom drama.

40:05.396 --> 40:08.345
Yes, enough drama
to fill a legal thriller.

40:08.714 --> 40:09.999
Maybe you should try
a new genre.

40:10.101 --> 40:12.949
Maybe I should try to make sure
I never testify in court again.

40:13.068 --> 40:15.137
You kept an innocent woman out
of jail, Rick.

40:15.239 --> 40:16.572
I'm proud of you for that.

40:16.674 --> 40:18.507
Couldn't have done it
without you.

40:21.868 --> 40:23.095
So...

40:23.464 --> 40:25.781
How is your investigation
into Loksat coming along?

40:25.883 --> 40:26.982
You know
I can't tell you about that.

40:27.051 --> 40:28.884
Right, right. For my own safety.

40:28.953 --> 40:31.720
Uh... But I can tell you this.

40:31.822 --> 40:33.367
I'm getting close.

40:33.591 --> 40:36.692
That's good, because so am I.
