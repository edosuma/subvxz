00:13.160 --> 00:15.020
Sir, your noodles
are here.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.860
Finally.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.260
Any word on locating Pops?

00:19.360 --> 00:21.880
We're still scouring
the Bleisdorf Quadrant, sir.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.460
Any word on locating
the special sauce?

00:26.560 --> 00:27.820
Scouring the bag, sir.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.380
Uh, there doesn't seem
to be any, sir.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.460
What?!

00:31.560 --> 00:32.420
( Yells )

00:32.520 --> 00:33.380
( Splat )

00:33.480 --> 00:35.420
NoodleâVerse is the worst!

00:35.520 --> 00:38.500
There were no packets
of special sauce in my bag.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.600
Never ordering from you again!

00:41.760 --> 00:43.980
Huh? Where are
the negative stars?

00:44.080 --> 00:46.860
NoodleâVerse deserves
negative stars!

00:46.960 --> 00:48.460
( Growls ) Rrr.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.220
Yes,
Yello Customer Service?

00:51.320 --> 00:53.580
I'm trying to leave
a negativeâstar review and ââ

00:53.680 --> 00:56.620
What do you mean the lowest
review is zero stars?!

00:56.720 --> 00:59.100
They deserve negative
five stars!

00:59.200 --> 01:04.020
Your archaic rating system does
not reflect my level of hate!

01:04.120 --> 01:06.320
( Thump )

01:10.880 --> 01:12.740
( Gasps ) Oh dear!

01:12.840 --> 01:14.260
He has grown more powerful

01:14.360 --> 01:16.600
than a fiveâstar rating system
can contain.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.620
All right, Pops, go!

01:19.720 --> 01:21.020
Hyah!

01:21.120 --> 01:21.980
Yah. Yah.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.940
Yah.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.100
Yah.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.200
( Groans )

01:30.160 --> 01:32.060
Wait, did you even
hit it?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.620
I don't want
to break it.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.540
This board
could one day grow up

01:35.640 --> 01:38.260
to be a beautiful
dinette centerpiece.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.100
Pops, we're supposed to be
training you.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.340
C'mon, Pops!

01:41.440 --> 01:43.100
Fly like a butterfly,
sting like a...

01:43.200 --> 01:44.300
Hey, wait, Pops.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.060
Sting like a bee, Pops!
A bee!

01:46.160 --> 01:47.420
This isn't working.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.100
I'm hungry.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.980
â( Laughing )
â( Sighs )

01:51.080 --> 01:52.860
Our B's are about
to be stung.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.460
And by that,
I mean our butts.
Why?

01:55.560 --> 01:57.500
AntiâPops forever grows
in power.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.300
We must hasten
our training.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.580
How are we gonna
do that?

02:00.680 --> 02:02.680
Even with everyone helping,
it's still going slow.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.140
Have you heard
of the ancient technique

02:05.240 --> 02:06.740
of training montage?!?

02:06.840 --> 02:07.700
Montage?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.180
No. What is it?

02:09.280 --> 02:11.460
Masters of it
could condense time and space

02:11.560 --> 02:12.900
to train faster.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.620
They could skip right over
the parts

02:14.720 --> 02:16.720
where they took
a break to pee or fart.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.100
âWait, that sounds familiar.
âOh yeah.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.160
It's a film technique
in which a collection of shots,

02:20.240 --> 02:22.240
cut with wipes and dissolves
in quick succession,

02:22.120 --> 02:24.120
is used to condense
space and time.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.620
I went to art school.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.180
Yes, exactly.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.140
By doing this, they were
able to do weeks of training

02:29.240 --> 02:31.420
in mere days
to reach the next level.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.460
Is Pops going to level up
like in a video game?

02:33.560 --> 02:35.180
Something like that.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.860
âCoooool!
âCoooool!

02:37.960 --> 02:39.860
Aaah, music.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.820
With the right track,
these lessons will fly by.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.060
This is
my favorite song.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.020
( Music plays )

02:46.120 --> 02:47.260
( Inhales sharply )

02:47.360 --> 02:49.360
Yah!

02:50.360 --> 02:52.360
Yahâhuh.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.180
( Sizzle! )

02:54.280 --> 02:56.280
( Splat! )

02:58.920 --> 03:00.920
( Splash! )

03:05.560 --> 03:07.560
( Thump! )

03:13.360 --> 03:15.360
( Click )

03:25.280 --> 03:27.280
( Coin clinks )

03:32.440 --> 03:34.440
( Groans )

03:39.280 --> 03:41.520
( Blowing )

03:55.440 --> 03:57.440
( Water splashing )

04:07.560 --> 04:09.180
<i>Level up!</i>

04:09.280 --> 04:10.380
âWhoa!
âWhoa!

04:10.480 --> 04:11.820
âHe leveled up!
âHe leveled up!

04:11.920 --> 04:12.780
Again!

04:12.880 --> 04:14.880
( Music plays )

04:17.160 --> 04:19.380
This montage technique
is nuts, dude.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.940
Yeah, man,
it's crazy!

04:21.040 --> 04:23.040
First they're like,
over here,

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
and then they're all,
wipe!

04:23.400 --> 04:24.540
Boom!
Hey, we're over here.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.700
Yeah, I bet Pops
will be ready in no time.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.500
I even like the song.
It's catchy.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.020
Hwah! Yeah!

04:30.120 --> 04:31.140
Hwah. ( Chuckles )

04:31.240 --> 04:32.900
( Both grunting )

04:33.000 --> 04:34.260
( Both laugh )

04:34.360 --> 04:35.900
( Crickets chirping )

04:36.000 --> 04:37.820
( Click, music plays )

04:37.920 --> 04:40.860
Ugh.
It's so early.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.660
( Both groaning )

04:42.760 --> 04:44.020
âAhh!
âAhh!

04:44.120 --> 04:45.620
( Both gasp )

04:45.720 --> 04:46.780
âNo!
âWait! Stop!

04:46.880 --> 04:48.620
Wait!
âNo! No!

04:48.720 --> 04:49.660
( Video game noises )

04:49.760 --> 04:51.500
Hey!
You lose!

04:51.600 --> 04:52.540
Aw, man!

04:52.640 --> 04:54.640
How long
is this going to take?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.100
Level up!

04:57.200 --> 04:59.180
( Crickets chirping )

04:59.280 --> 05:01.900
Dude, I can't handle
that song anymore.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.860
He played it
like 120 times.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.460
What are we gonna do?

05:05.560 --> 05:06.660
I have an idea.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.500
Let's change
the tunage.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.500
( Panting ) I'm ready for
today's training montage, Earl!

05:12.600 --> 05:14.660
Ah, you've caught
the montage bug.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.860
If we keep this steady pace,
we should be ready in two weeks.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
( "Through The Fire And Flames"
plays )

05:19.280 --> 05:20.100
What?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.940
It's so (pants) strong.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.300
âWhere is my music?
âI dunno.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.300
Get something
a little different, I guess.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.180
Don't you know
what you've done?!

05:27.280 --> 05:30.300
And endlessly
we're roaming free tonight

05:30.400 --> 05:31.860
Huh?

05:31.960 --> 05:37.180
And on the wings of a dream
so far beyond reality

05:37.280 --> 05:39.180
All alone in desperation
What's the problem?

05:39.280 --> 05:41.280
It just looks like
he's training faster.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.860
Don't you see?

05:41.960 --> 05:43.300
Montages are more powerful

05:43.400 --> 05:44.820
the faster the song is!

05:44.920 --> 05:46.340
...my own mind

05:46.440 --> 05:48.220
Level up!

05:48.320 --> 05:49.860
Ah! Huh?
Ah! Huh?
Ah! Huh?

05:49.960 --> 05:51.960
All right, Pops,
you chopped the board.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.600
That's enough montage
for now.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.960
No! Don't get near him!

05:55.520 --> 05:56.540
Huh?
Huh?

05:56.640 --> 05:58.300
Ugh.
Ugh.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.300
Huh?
Pops, you gotta stop!

06:00.400 --> 06:01.500
âHuh?
âUgh!

06:01.600 --> 06:03.020
Pops!

06:03.120 --> 06:04.100
( Branches cracking )

06:04.200 --> 06:05.500
How long
is this song?

06:05.600 --> 06:07.260
It's 5 1/2 minutes!

06:07.360 --> 06:10.060
You have to turn off the boom
box from within the montage!

06:10.160 --> 06:12.200
We can't do it
or we'll get sucked in, too!

06:13.920 --> 06:15.740
Level up!

06:15.840 --> 06:16.700
Ha!

06:16.800 --> 06:18.660
Ahh!
Ahh!

06:18.760 --> 06:20.760
After him!

06:21.800 --> 06:23.800
âHuh?
âHuh?

06:25.360 --> 06:27.360
How'd I get
this fishing pole?

06:26.480 --> 06:28.300
Montage logic!
Just use it!

06:28.400 --> 06:30.220
Hwuh!

06:30.320 --> 06:31.420
Whuuuh! Ugh!

06:31.520 --> 06:33.020
Dang it.
The wipe cut my line!

06:33.120 --> 06:36.180
Pops, the bed is made.
You can stop!

06:36.280 --> 06:37.820
All right,
our next step is ââ

06:37.920 --> 06:39.460
What? No!

06:39.560 --> 06:42.660
Oh great, now we're stuck
in the montage, too!

06:42.760 --> 06:46.380
Way to mess everything up with
your young, hip, fast music.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.580
This is dangerous!

06:47.680 --> 06:50.100
You can't just throw
fast music around!

06:50.200 --> 06:52.020
( Tapping )

06:52.120 --> 06:54.120
Whoa,
it didn't explode.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.440
Uhh.
Uhh.
Uhh.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.840
Go get
the boom box!

07:00.720 --> 07:02.420
Level up!

07:02.520 --> 07:03.380
Hwuh! Augh!

07:03.480 --> 07:04.660
All: Augh!

07:04.760 --> 07:06.760
Eh?

07:11.360 --> 07:13.360
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

07:15.640 --> 07:17.640
( Glass cracks )

07:18.200 --> 07:20.140
He's montaging
out of control.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.900
If we don't stop him,
he'll destroy everything!

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
( Screams )

07:27.600 --> 07:29.600
( Water splashes )

07:38.680 --> 07:40.900
( Rumbling )
( Gasps ) What's that sound?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.040
It's a thematically
appropriate transition!

07:48.520 --> 07:50.500
That coin was huge!

07:50.600 --> 07:52.420
Are we breathing in space?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.540
This isn't space ââ
It is the void!

07:54.640 --> 07:57.540
This is where you end up
when you reach peak montage!

07:57.640 --> 08:00.020
Color cards, morphing,
split screens ââ

08:00.120 --> 08:01.460
Anything can happen here!

08:01.560 --> 08:03.560
Where's Pops?

08:04.160 --> 08:05.860
( Squirt, squirt, crunch )

08:05.960 --> 08:07.960
( Boom, boom, boom )

08:10.760 --> 08:12.760
He's perfecting
every exercise!

08:13.960 --> 08:15.740
Pops, slow down!

08:15.840 --> 08:17.840
Pops, just ââ

08:18.880 --> 08:21.060
What are we
supposed to do?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.980
Every training montage
has a place

08:23.080 --> 08:25.500
that appears repeatedly
to show someone's progress.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.120
If we find the nexus point,
we can turn off that boom box!

08:30.400 --> 08:32.620
Huh? Ahh!

08:32.720 --> 08:33.940
I'm a ghost!

08:34.040 --> 08:36.100
Ah! Ahh!

08:36.200 --> 08:38.580
Bro, is this what it's like
for you all the time?

08:38.680 --> 08:39.860
Pretty much.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.620
I'm, uh...I'm getting
a little sick here.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.260
You are not ghosts!
You are overlays!

08:45.360 --> 08:47.300
Now figure out
Pops' nexus point!

08:47.400 --> 08:50.100
...with their blood
on our hands

08:50.200 --> 08:52.460
We fought so hard,
now can we understand

08:52.560 --> 08:53.940
The wood chopping!

08:54.040 --> 08:55.980
He always levels up
when he chops wood!

08:56.080 --> 08:57.820
Rigby, get to where
the boom box will be

08:57.920 --> 08:59.140
when we come out
of the void!

08:59.240 --> 09:00.780
Throw me, Skips!

09:00.880 --> 09:03.420
( Grunts ) Eaugh!

09:03.520 --> 09:06.740
So far away
we wait for the day

09:06.840 --> 09:08.740
Uhh, a little faster,
Rigby!

09:08.840 --> 09:12.300
For the light source
so wasted and gone

09:12.400 --> 09:13.580
( Grunts )

09:13.680 --> 09:16.060
We feel the pain
of a lifetime

09:16.160 --> 09:17.940
Lost in a thousand days

09:18.040 --> 09:21.260
Oh, no, all he has left to do
is write the perfect signature!

09:21.360 --> 09:23.680
...we carry on!

09:24.760 --> 09:26.500
Is the boom box
about here?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.180
âDude, it's to the left.
âTo the left.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.360
( Indistinct shouting )
Here?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
( Shouting continues )

09:35.400 --> 09:36.300
Here?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
âThat's it!
âStay there.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.820
( Gasps )
The perfect signature!

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
All: Ahhh!

09:46.760 --> 09:48.460
Rigby! The boombox!

09:48.560 --> 09:50.560
( Grunts ) Hwuh!

09:52.520 --> 09:56.420
All: ( Panting )

09:56.520 --> 09:58.520
( Music stops )

09:59.640 --> 10:01.960
Level up!

10:03.920 --> 10:05.060
âHuh?
âHuh?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.540
( Grunts ) Ugh.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
( Grunts ) Ugh.
Pops?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.660
Rain.
