WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:08.175
- Oh, my... Sorry, I thought...
- Sorry, we're just leaving.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.593
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.182
I don't remember
what happened last night.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.059
There are days
that I am missing.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.477
I think
I know who did this.

00:20.479 --> 00:21.731
Emma, it's me, Sam.

00:21.731 --> 00:24.400
<i>The Woods,
the-the Stardust Drive-In.</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:26.610
<i>I'm gonna find a way
to make you remember.</i>

00:26.610 --> 00:28.738
- Remember what?
- That you're a hero.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.657
<i>That guy's crazy.</i>

00:31.657 --> 00:32.700
Kind of cute, though, right?

00:32.700 --> 00:33.743
<i>Your parents</i>

00:33.743 --> 00:34.910
shot you up
with a dangerous drug

00:34.910 --> 00:36.787
to make a buck off you.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.414
My parents are dead
because I killed them.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.124
<i>I fucking hate myself.</i>

00:40.124 --> 00:41.417
I grabbed
my little brother

00:41.417 --> 00:43.252
and I told him to go away
and never come back.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.879
<i>That was the first time
my powers showed up.</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:47.923
<i>I think something
really fucked happened to us</i>

00:47.923 --> 00:50.176
and I think Dean Shetty
is a part of it.

00:50.176 --> 00:54.513
I am this fucking close
to perfecting the virus.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.391
<i>It's Cate. Cate made
Golden Boy forget he even had</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:58.851
a brother
over and over and over...

01:00.603 --> 01:03.230
- Tell them it isn't true.
- I'm so sorry.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.357
You're a fucking monster.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.365
Remember everything
I made you forget.

01:19.622 --> 01:20.998
Whoa.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.374
Thanks.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.960
So glad I had to relive
that fucking nightmare.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.879
I have to go get Sam.

01:28.631 --> 01:32.968
Also, you're a cunt.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.013
Shetty made you do this?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.473
You were in my fucking head.

01:37.473 --> 01:38.641
Why?

01:38.641 --> 01:40.768
- I'm sorry.
- You had no fucking right.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.061
I thought I was...

01:42.061 --> 01:43.270
Whoa. Hey.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.147
...doing the right thing.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.733
<i>How could she
do this to us?</i>

01:47.733 --> 01:49.068
<i>I'll never
forgive her for this.</i>

01:55.741 --> 01:57.576
Andre?

02:00.663 --> 02:03.249
I think she made Luke
kill Brink.

02:05.251 --> 02:06.335
And kill himself.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.546
I don't... I don't think so.

02:08.546 --> 02:10.005
I don't...

02:10.005 --> 02:11.674
- think she would do that.
- No.

02:11.674 --> 02:14.426
That is exactly what she does.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.347
She makes you
fall in love with her...

02:19.390 --> 02:20.724
...and then she fucks you over.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.561
No. This school fucks you over.

02:23.561 --> 02:27.773
You know, getting into God U...

02:29.024 --> 02:31.902
...was the best day of my life.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.574
And it's no different
than the shithole I grew up in.

02:36.574 --> 02:39.326
You know what's wild?
I can handle that.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.829
I can even deal
with the fact that my...

02:41.829 --> 02:43.706
my father's
a coward piece of shit.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.624
But all of this?

02:48.127 --> 02:49.670
After everything...

02:50.754 --> 02:52.131
Cate?

02:52.131 --> 02:54.884
I mean, she was fucked over
just like the rest of us.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.261
No. No.
She was a part of it, Marie.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.721
I think we should talk to her.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.724
No.

03:03.726 --> 03:06.312
Because then
I'd just forgive her.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.481
Help!
I need some help in here!

03:10.441 --> 03:13.152
Holy shit! What happened?

03:13.152 --> 03:15.154
When she pushes too much,
it fucks with her head.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.530
- Didn't you learn CPR?
- Where?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.991
At superhero school? Jesus!

03:18.991 --> 03:21.952
Her... her pulse is slowing.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.496
- Can you speed it up?
- I don't know. I-I, um...

03:24.496 --> 03:27.416
- What if it kills her?
- Just do something.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.225
She's breathing.
She's breathing.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.482
Wh... When does she wake up?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.542
Hello, Betsy.
How are you feeling?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.718
Interesting.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.221
How long has she been like this?

04:22.221 --> 04:24.264
Since I injected
the virus, two days ago.

04:25.808 --> 04:28.394
- Is there any risk
of us getting sick?
- No, no.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.062
None at all.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.106
The virus only affects Supes.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.066
It attaches to the Compound V
in their blood.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.695
This is payoff for all the work
I've done with Sam.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.863
A way to compassionately
control Supes.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.784
My report to Vought
will be ready to submit today.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.454
No. Not until we're ready.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.415
We are ready.

04:49.415 --> 04:52.960
These results are exactly
what they've been looking for.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.546
It's the very reason
The Woods exists.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.882
I agree with you, Dr. Cardosa,
but we mustn't get premature.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.385
What do you mean?

05:01.385 --> 05:04.179
Concentrate the dose.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.434
Let's see how sick
we can make her.

05:19.278 --> 05:22.156
Cate. Cate, can you hear us?

05:22.156 --> 05:24.950
- Has she ever pushed
this much before?
- Who cares?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.036
This is what she gets
for mind-raping her friends.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.419
Holy shit, where'd she go?

05:35.419 --> 05:37.212
Um, guys?

05:40.507 --> 05:41.967
What?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.433
Oh, what the fuck?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.240
Oh, shit.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.617
What's happening?

06:06.617 --> 06:08.911
Maybe Cate's more powerful
than we thought.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.871
Whatever.
I'm done with this shit.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.331
Andre, wait.

06:12.331 --> 06:15.125
We don't even know where we are.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.710
Or what she did to us.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.007
Caleb!

06:23.634 --> 06:24.802
Caleb?

06:27.304 --> 06:29.389
Who is that?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.809
Come back! Please!

06:31.809 --> 06:34.561
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we've
been looking for three days.

06:34.561 --> 06:38.524
Don't. He's only six years old.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.067
Keep looking.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.654
- Caleb?
- Caleb?

06:43.654 --> 06:45.823
Yeah, that was
Cate's brother's name.

06:45.823 --> 06:47.699
The one she sent away.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.451
Mommy? Mommy!

06:49.451 --> 06:51.328
Cate, wait!

06:51.328 --> 06:52.412
Just...

06:52.412 --> 06:54.373
<i>wait there.</i>

06:54.373 --> 06:57.835
Holy shit. This is a memory.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.419
<i>I don't feel
safe with her.</i>

06:59.419 --> 07:02.381
We're in Cate's head.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.758
Mommy,
it was an accident.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.218
Why did Caleb listen to me?

07:06.218 --> 07:07.970
<i>He never does.</i>

07:07.970 --> 07:09.263
- I don't feel safe with her.
- Okay.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.890
Why don't you
come with me, Cate?

07:11.890 --> 07:12.891
We'll sort this out, all right?

07:12.891 --> 07:14.893
Mommy, I didn't mean to.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.020
Hey, do you like dogs?
We got a K9 unit over here,

07:17.020 --> 07:18.355
they'll let you pet one.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.525
All right? Just come with me.

07:25.863 --> 07:29.366
Okay, just give me
a little distance, would you?

07:29.366 --> 07:30.367
Hey!

07:31.910 --> 07:34.621
What are you greasy sack
of fuck nuts doing in here?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.999
- What in the fuck?
- Soldier Boy?

07:36.999 --> 07:38.500
What are you doing in here?

07:38.500 --> 07:42.171
I'm Cate's imaginary friend
from when she was a kid.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.881
Boyfriend, really.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.050
I taught her how to jerk off.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.844
Diddle that Skittle.
Flick the bean.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.429
How to find
that man in the canoe.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.722
She came like a faucet.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.223
She'd crank up
the Jonas Brothers

07:53.223 --> 07:54.933
and she'd hump
a Soldier Boy pillow.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.769
She'd raw-dog that pillow
till she saw God.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.812
Gross.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.439
It was pretty romantic.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.691
- Hell yeah, brother.
- Shut the fuck up.

08:02.691 --> 08:03.859
Fuck you.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.277
She...

08:05.277 --> 08:07.821
She just didn't like, she didn't
like Jonas Brothers, was all.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.907
I know you.

08:09.907 --> 08:13.035
Yeah, you're Cate's new fuckboy.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.411
She really loves you.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.414
But whatever.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.875
Boys, they come and go.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.377
But she always comes back
to a little...

08:22.377 --> 08:23.837
pillow talk.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.963
Fuck you.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.298
You're a Russian agent
is what you are.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.592
Andre. Bigger shit
going on right now.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.135
What the hell you talking about?

08:30.135 --> 08:32.387
- Turns out you were radicalized
by the Russians.
- Fuck you.

08:32.387 --> 08:35.515
I'm no godless, dickless commie.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.684
I'm red-blooded.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.353
But not commie red.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.104
Red-white-and-blue red.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.606
I fart
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

08:42.606 --> 08:43.941
You're pretty
fucking weird, dude.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.025
Yeah? Knock knock.
Who's there?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.443
Go fuck your face.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.569
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.695
We need to know what's going on.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.821
Well, beats me.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.531
Cate wants you in here
for some reason.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.866
You better figure it out
quick, though,

08:52.866 --> 08:54.034
before you get stuck in here.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.577
Wait, stuck in here?

08:55.577 --> 08:57.120
Like forever?

08:59.998 --> 09:02.000
See that?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.879
That wasn't lightning.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.215
That was a burst blood vessel.

09:08.215 --> 09:12.177
Cate's head is unraveling
in real time.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.721
She becomes a vegetable,
so do you.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.932
<i>All right, listen to me.</i>

09:16.932 --> 09:19.059
You really want to live,

09:19.059 --> 09:22.604
then the single most important
thing I can tell you...

09:24.731 --> 09:27.651
Oh, shit. Soldier Boy's dead.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.652
If that's what happens
to her imaginary friend,

09:28.652 --> 09:29.736
what happens to us?

09:30.779 --> 09:32.322
- We should go.
- Yeah.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.324
That guy was a dick, right?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.295
You came back.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.379
Heroes always come back, right?

09:47.379 --> 09:48.463
You remembered.

09:49.673 --> 09:50.841
Oh.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.928
I missed you.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.139
For real?

10:00.642 --> 10:02.477
For real-real.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.529
Mm.

10:24.666 --> 10:25.667
Should we...

10:25.667 --> 10:28.086
You mean... You mean like sex?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.629
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.799
Yes, just... I've, uh...

10:32.799 --> 10:33.967
I've never...

10:33.967 --> 10:35.761
Oh.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.805
Like never?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.183
I mean, my...

10:41.183 --> 10:42.893
hand.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.895
And he's competent.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.439
But...

10:49.191 --> 10:50.776
I want to.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.362
With you.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.865
Are you sure?
I mean, there's no pressure.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.367

Oh, God.

12:32.294 --> 12:35.213
What-what if, what if Cate
is dying in the real world?

12:35.213 --> 12:37.632
And what happens if she dies
and we're still in here?

12:37.632 --> 12:38.884
Then kill me now.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.844
Why am I here?
I don't even like Cate.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.138
Can you bitches
slow down, please?

12:53.482 --> 12:56.443
<i>...function,
derivative, and integral.</i>

12:56.443 --> 12:57.944
<i>A function defines
the connection</i>

12:57.944 --> 13:00.655
<i>between two variables,
such as distance and time,</i>

13:00.655 --> 13:02.699
<i>temperature and volume,
et cetera,</i>

13:02.699 --> 13:04.701
<i>in an equation.</i>

13:07.996 --> 13:09.331
Keep your distance.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.083
And don't let her touch you.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.093
You can leave us.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.138
Hello, Cate.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.265
My name's Indira.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.272
I'm not afraid of you, Cate.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.821
How long have they
kept you here?

13:44.282 --> 13:45.951
Nine years.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.119
I am so sorry
to hear that.

13:48.119 --> 13:51.623
I can't imagine how hard
that must be for you to bear.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.168
You don't have to wear
the gloves if you don't want to.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.419
I trust you.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.922
I'm supposed to wear them

13:58.922 --> 14:01.091
whenever anyone's here.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.468
I'm here to help you.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.683
What happened to your brother
was a terrible tragedy.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.060
It was an accident.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.313
Now, I know that you think
it's your fault...

14:15.313 --> 14:16.940
but it's not.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.775
It was my fault.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.070
- My mother...
- Your mother is afraid.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.198
Because you are
exceptionally powerful.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.451
But keeping you in here
will only fuel that fear.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.121
What you need is help

14:31.121 --> 14:32.914
understanding your power.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.708
Help controlling it.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.711
I've tried. It doesn't work.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.423
Sometimes the thoughts
are so loud,

14:41.423 --> 14:43.341
I feel like I'm going crazy.

14:43.341 --> 14:47.220
What if I told you
we could make the voices stop?

14:56.813 --> 15:00.066
If you take these every day...

15:02.027 --> 15:05.155
...those voices
won't bother you anymore.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.544
Would you like a hug? Yeah?

15:21.296 --> 15:22.380
Come on.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.215
Yeah.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.726
I haven't been to class
in years.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.315
Oh, my God.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.333
Hey.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.128
I'm Luke.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.256
Cate.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.342
You, uh...

16:07.342 --> 16:08.885
you seem pretty smart.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.181
Could I cheat off of you?

16:14.516 --> 16:16.267
You're gonna ride my coattails?

16:16.267 --> 16:18.812
All the way to the top.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.150
We-we should, we should leave,
I-I can't be here.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.569
I miss you, man.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.878
I-I miss you, too, man.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.255
So fucking much.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.552
But you know what?

16:52.429 --> 16:54.055
I don't believe you.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.149
You thought I didn't know.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.734
- Know what?
- Andre,

17:05.734 --> 17:07.152
what's he talking about?

17:26.504 --> 17:28.339
<i>Oh, we really shouldn't do this.</i>

17:28.339 --> 17:29.674
<i>Mm.</i>

17:29.674 --> 17:31.259
<i>What if Luke finds out?</i>

17:31.259 --> 17:34.012
<i>Yeah. Yeah, we really...</i>

17:50.153 --> 17:52.030
How many times?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.492
- Are you fucking serious?
- No.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.618
Was that real?

17:56.618 --> 17:58.661
She didn't make you do it,
did she?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.582
You wanted to.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.627
Behind my back.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.878
I'm-I'm sorry.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.588
I thought you were
my best friend.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.844
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
out of my way, cunts!

18:16.429 --> 18:18.056
Oh, Jesus.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.729
I can't switch.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.272
My powers aren't working either.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.859
- Marie, Marie, Marie!
- Run!

18:29.859 --> 18:31.820
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

18:38.660 --> 18:40.078
Seriously, Andre?

18:40.078 --> 18:41.996
You're that guy?

18:41.996 --> 18:44.666
What, you don't think
I feel like a piece of shit?

18:45.792 --> 18:46.835
I loved her.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.754
Stop fucking lying to me.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.297
Hey, you need
to calm down.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.423
No, I'm not
gonna calm down

18:52.423 --> 18:54.133
unless you give me some answers.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.677
Luke, you know
what I always tell you.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.887
No, fuck that, okay?
I don't want to hear any more

18:57.887 --> 18:59.722
- of your bullshit...
- Hey.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.813
Oh, shit.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.356
Do we think
Cate's in there?

19:08.356 --> 19:11.734
She isn't.
This isn't Cate's memory.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.113
It's mine.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.281
How?

19:16.281 --> 19:18.658
How the fuck is it yours?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.285
- Professor Brink, you okay?
- What the fuck

19:20.285 --> 19:21.995
- was that, Brink?!
- I need
some help in here.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.080
What the fuck did you just do?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.748
Where's Sam?
I want to see him right now.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.458
What's going on?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.419
He's a fucking liar.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.753
Tell me everything.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.964
What the hell
is going on, Jordan?

19:32.964 --> 19:34.549
It's all right, buddy.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.384
It's all right.
I'll tell you everything.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.552
Just take it easy. Easy.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.178
You're so full of shit.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.305
Breathe.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.015
Deep breath.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.563
I need a response team
in here now.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.285
Hmm.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.995
Jordan.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.790
What do I always say, huh?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.293
Being a hero,
it's not about the glory.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.503
- It's about...
- It's about sacrifice.

20:12.503 --> 20:16.716
I know, sir, but what the hell
kind of sacrifice was that?

20:16.716 --> 20:21.721
Well, Luke... Luke needs
cutting-edge treatments,

20:21.721 --> 20:24.390
put him over the edge.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.643
That boy could be
Homelander strong.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.561
But sometimes...

20:28.561 --> 20:30.772
sometimes he has a bad reaction.

20:30.772 --> 20:33.942
If Luke's getting cutting-edge
treatments, I want 'em, too.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.818
Always looking out
for yourself, huh?

20:37.612 --> 20:40.531
Kid, you got a strong head.
You don't need 'em.

20:40.531 --> 20:44.035
Tell me, do you remember
sitting in that chair,

20:44.035 --> 20:46.913
a scared-shitless freshman
who never wanted to switch?

20:46.913 --> 20:50.291
And I promised that I would
always take good care of you.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.960
Remember?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.170
Now...

20:54.170 --> 20:56.005
Jordan,

20:56.005 --> 20:58.925
people just don't understand
the lows it takes

20:58.925 --> 21:01.761
to reach great heights.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.639
And so now I want you
to promise me,

21:04.639 --> 21:06.182
as my new T.A.,

21:06.182 --> 21:07.809
that you will always protect me.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.603
Not a word of this to anyone.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.355
You're making me your T.A.?

21:12.355 --> 21:14.983
That's how you became
Brink's gatekeeper?

21:14.983 --> 21:19.070
Of course.
Because you've earned it.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.573
Can I trust you?

21:22.573 --> 21:24.659
Yes, sir.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.119
I'm honored.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.328
Good.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.663
So you knew.

21:28.663 --> 21:32.083
You knew Golden Boy
attacked Brink before.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.127
- I don't know what I knew.
- Looks like you knew a lot.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.920
He said he was
juicing Golden Boy!

21:35.920 --> 21:39.298
- What would any of you done?
- Something, Jordan!

21:45.138 --> 21:47.682
We could have stopped
everything right here.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.561
Saved someone.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.062
Like we always wanted.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.648
But instead we're a fucking T.A.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.941
saving our own ass.

21:56.941 --> 22:00.194
I loved Brink. He was good.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.573
Or not.

22:04.615 --> 22:08.411
- But he was good to us.
- He was nice to us.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.163
Nice is all it takes

22:10.163 --> 22:12.290
for us to let someone
get royally fucked?

22:13.958 --> 22:16.085
You're a coward.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.715
And you always will be.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.606
That...

22:36.606 --> 22:39.150
was...

22:39.150 --> 22:40.985
amazing.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.656
I think I saw God.

22:45.656 --> 22:48.326
Like 14 times.

22:48.326 --> 22:51.537
I think I saw...

22:54.082 --> 22:56.375
I mean...

22:56.375 --> 22:58.836
Yeah, that was...

22:58.836 --> 23:00.046
that was good.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.131
Just good?

23:05.927 --> 23:07.845
You regret it, don't you?

23:07.845 --> 23:09.430
No.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.727
No. The opposite.

23:16.687 --> 23:20.566
You, and that, was amazing.

23:21.943 --> 23:23.528
But...

23:23.528 --> 23:25.905
I don't think
I can do that 24/7.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.408
I-I mean, maybe...

23:29.408 --> 23:31.994
23/7.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.917
I'm messed up, Emma.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.339
You should be
with someone that isn't.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.759
Well, maybe I want
to be with you.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.595
I mean, I'm messed up, too.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.931
I mean,
I have really bad breath.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.599
It's like really bad.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.522
And we both smell
like sweaty popcorn.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.108
We do?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.901
Is...

24:03.901 --> 24:06.612
- Is that... is that normal?
- Yes.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.739
Yes. Yes, we do.

24:08.739 --> 24:09.991
Okay.

24:09.991 --> 24:12.493
And no, it's not.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.831
I don't mind.

24:20.918 --> 24:23.421
I wish we could
stay here forever.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.256
Me, too.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.384
Let's run away together.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.136
No.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.848
<i>♪ Probably shouldn't be

24:38.603 --> 24:39.979

This is...

25:10.134 --> 25:11.886
- The Woods.
- The Woods.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.014
And the thing I don't get is,

25:15.014 --> 25:17.558
that was my memory, not Cate's.

25:17.558 --> 25:21.395
It's like her shit and our shit
are bleeding together.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.147
Yeah, let's talk about
your shit, actually.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.815
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, okay?

25:24.815 --> 25:26.734
I bought into
all of Brink's bullshit.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.736
He was just like Shetty,
and I didn't want to see it.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.490
Fuck this place.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.993
I'm gonna make it right.
For Luke.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.305
What the fuck are they doing?

25:57.807 --> 25:59.016
Wait.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.687
What the fuck
are you guys doing to me?!

26:02.687 --> 26:04.272
- Sam!
- Hurry. Now.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.065
Sam, wake up! Sam!

26:06.065 --> 26:07.525
Cate...

26:09.026 --> 26:10.861
Cate. Cate, help me.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.655
- Help me out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.573
You're gonna forget
this is happening.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.658
Cate, please.

26:15.658 --> 26:16.951
You're gonna forget
about The Woods.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.287
Your brother is dead.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.122
Go to sleep.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.003
Forget. Forget. Forget.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.629
<i>Forget.</i>

26:30.089 --> 26:31.882
Holy shit.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.260
She knew everything
from the fucking jump.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.263
How many times do you think
she did that to him?

26:37.263 --> 26:38.806
A lot.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.475
You think that's what broke him?

26:41.475 --> 26:42.935
Seems like it broke
both of them.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.353
It's not working.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.855
I think it's messing
with his head.

26:45.855 --> 26:48.607
He keeps remembering, like...

26:48.607 --> 26:50.026
like a dam breaking.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.445
Oh, he seems fine to me.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.363
He's burning hotter than ever.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.574
You see?
You're helping him, Cate.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.659
You're doing a wonderful job.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.954
Except...

27:03.789 --> 27:05.583
Make them forget.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.177
- We're fucked.
- Over there!

27:16.177 --> 27:18.596
Let's go!

27:21.223 --> 27:22.391
Oh, no.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.935
I know that door.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.558
Is that you?

28:20.157 --> 28:21.700
Annabeth?

28:24.787 --> 28:26.539
You killed them.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.958
I...

28:28.958 --> 28:31.168
I'm not... I-I didn't...

28:31.168 --> 28:33.170
I didn't mean to, I...

28:33.170 --> 28:35.589
You tell everyone you lost
control, but you didn't.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.174
You were angry
that they barged in,

28:37.174 --> 28:38.592
and-and everything that happened

28:38.592 --> 28:40.136
happened because
you wanted it to.

28:43.055 --> 28:46.559
No matter how hard
you try to be a hero...

28:47.977 --> 28:50.271
...you'll always be
a murderer to me.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.943
I'll never forgive you.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.028
And you shouldn't either.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.823
I'm sorry.

29:02.283 --> 29:05.828
I'm so sorry.

29:07.037 --> 29:10.082
I-I ruined everything.

29:13.252 --> 29:18.257
I-I didn't understand
my powers, I...

29:21.051 --> 29:23.345
Like you, Cate!

29:23.345 --> 29:27.391
You told me it wasn't my fault!

29:30.936 --> 29:33.022
None of this is our fault.

29:33.022 --> 29:34.607
<i>Your mom and dad
wasn't your fault.</i>

29:34.607 --> 29:36.150
<i>I'm not a monster.</i>

29:36.150 --> 29:38.736
<i>Your parents shot you up
with a dangerous drug</i>

29:38.736 --> 29:41.447
<i>when you were a baby
to make a buck off you.</i>

29:41.447 --> 29:43.949
<i>Don't spend a fucking minute
crying over them.</i>

29:43.949 --> 29:47.244
<i>What happened
to your brother was an accident.</i>

29:47.244 --> 29:49.830
<i>I know that you think
it's your fault,</i>

29:49.830 --> 29:51.248
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

29:51.248 --> 29:52.958
<i>It is not your fault.</i>

29:52.958 --> 29:54.502
You shouldn't be here.

29:54.502 --> 29:58.923
Cate, we're here now,
trying to wake you up.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.383
You can wake up right now.
I won't stop you anymore.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.968
Come on, let's all wake up
and get the fuck out of here.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.471
We've been through this.
You're fucked-up.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.515
I'm fucked-up.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.475
The one thing that is
really apparent now

30:09.475 --> 30:11.644
is that we are all fucked-up.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.271
I don't want to wake up.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.067
No.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.569
No, fuck that.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.071
Doesn't matter
what the fuck you want.

30:22.071 --> 30:23.864
Andre, I'm sorry.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.658
No. No, sorry doesn't cut it.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.910
You want to forget your problems
and not wake up?

30:27.910 --> 30:29.328
- No, fuck you.
- Hey, hey, Andre.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.371
No.

30:30.371 --> 30:32.248
I didn't want
someone that I love

30:32.248 --> 30:35.000
to burrow into my fucking brain.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.711
You manipulated us.

30:37.711 --> 30:40.631
Me. You manipulated me.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.008
And I know, I know that...

30:43.008 --> 30:46.262
your parents hurt you,
that Shetty...

30:47.388 --> 30:51.225
I see it. I see it.

30:51.225 --> 30:53.185
But I wish you would've chose
something different.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.604
Because I love you and I don't
want to fucking love you

30:55.604 --> 30:57.106
because I'll never
trust you again.

30:57.106 --> 31:00.317
But right now you have a choice.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.902
You finally have a choice.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.571
So wake the fuck up.

31:03.571 --> 31:06.824
You don't get to throw
this all away.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.703
Now I need you to remember.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.081
Please.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.208
So wake up.

31:53.287 --> 31:54.955
Is this real?

31:54.955 --> 31:56.498
Yes.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.177
Oh, thank God you're here.

32:09.470 --> 32:12.514
- Holy shit. You found him.
- Yeah.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.391
You have sex hair.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.019
No, I don't.

32:17.019 --> 32:20.898
Um, everyone, hi,
we kind of met before, um...

32:20.898 --> 32:23.192
This is Sam.

32:27.863 --> 32:28.864
You.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.243
- Sam!
- Sam, get off.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.679
Sam.

32:51.679 --> 32:54.056
Hey, listen.

32:54.056 --> 32:55.766
Let her go.

32:55.766 --> 32:58.477
She hurt you. And she hurt Luke.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.229
But you don't
have to hurt her back.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.231
You're better than that. Hey.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.774
Hey, look at me.

33:03.774 --> 33:06.276
You trust me, right?

33:07.611 --> 33:09.363
Let her go.

33:18.539 --> 33:19.915
Hey.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.919
I-I know you guys
don't trust me.

33:25.629 --> 33:29.299
Yeah. And you're gonna have to
work really hard to get it back.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.886
Let's start with The Woods.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.264
- What is Shetty
doing down there?
- I don't know.

33:35.264 --> 33:36.974
They were using Sam
to augment Luke's powers,

33:36.974 --> 33:39.393
but they were doing
other stuff to him, too.

33:39.393 --> 33:42.396
- And other kids.
- What other stuff?

33:42.396 --> 33:44.356
Bad stuff.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.192
She hates us.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.069
Shetty was directing it all.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.530
Okay.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.575
So she's the answer.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.621
We do this...

34:02.124 --> 34:04.334
...and there's no going back.

34:07.504 --> 34:09.131
I-I don't know what to do.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.425
I didn't mean to,
I was just following orders.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.273
We killed a Supe.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.649
My God.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.110
I-I mean, I thought
she'd get the flu.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.696
Some vomiting. Maybe diarrhea.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.823
So the virus worked?

34:34.823 --> 34:36.700
Only five millimeters more,
that was all.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.327
All right.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.253
