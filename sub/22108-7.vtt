WEBVTT

00:02.961 --> 00:04.838
Tina, how we doing? We almost there?

00:04.921 --> 00:06.006
We in the right spot?

00:06.089 --> 00:09.718
We just have to walk to that abandoned
warehouse on this dark, abandoned street.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.762
It's fine. Unless you think it's not,
and we should call Mom and Dad.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.848
No. We've gone rogue.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.433
We're not calling Mom and Dad.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.269
Nobody panic,
but I'm running out of walking cookies.

00:19.352 --> 00:24.190
Come on, guys, we're doing this for Mom,
and Christmas, a.k.a. our presents.

00:24.274 --> 00:28.028
Uh, maybe we shouldn't have snuck out.
I'm feeling sneaker-outer's remorse.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.197
Mom and Dad wouldn't want us
wandering around this part of town alone,

00:31.281 --> 00:34.117
so we had to sneak out
because we love them so much.

00:38.997 --> 00:39.998
Hello?

00:40.081 --> 00:41.791
I don't know, I think Mom and Dad

00:41.875 --> 00:44.836
would like to know that we're down
near the strange, abandoned building

00:44.919 --> 00:49.174
on the corner of Garfield Street
and Jackson Street, I think.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.802
-I can't read it very well.
-Tina? Tina, sweetie, can you hear me?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.888
I think the kids snuck out of the house.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.473
-Wait, what?
-Tina's butt-dialing me

00:56.556 --> 00:58.475
from the emergency phone. I can hear them.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.102
Tina. Tina, it's Mommy. Can you hear me?

01:01.186 --> 01:04.022
-Tina!
-Louise, I really think we should go home.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.441
There's nothing out here
except a thousand scary alleys.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.859
Guys. Oh, my gosh.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.402
It's one of Mom's ornaments.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.030
That's the one I made. You're safe now.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.032
Shh. It's all over. It's okay.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.617
Get this ornament a blanket.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.495
-What?
-Ah!

01:18.578 --> 01:21.039
-Hell no!
-This is real. This is happening.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.792
Should we, like, stake out the perimeter
and call for backup?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.960
No, there's no time.
It's Christmas frickin' Eve.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.630
Look, footprints. Let's follow them.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.465
Crap. Flashlight's dead.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.009
Looks like we'll be doing this
in the dark.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.552
Cool, cool, cool.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.058
-♪ The Bleaken is gonna ♪
-♪ The Bleaken is gonna ♪

01:41.226 --> 01:44.020
-♪ Wish that he was never born ♪
-♪ Wish that he was never born ♪

01:44.896 --> 01:48.191
-♪ We're coming for you, man ♪
-♪ We're coming for you, man ♪

01:48.274 --> 01:51.569
♪ Hold onto your horns ♪

01:51.653 --> 01:53.571
Protect us, Lord Santa.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.157
Now we just got to flip
on the air compressor and...

01:56.241 --> 01:58.368
Oh!

01:58.451 --> 01:59.327
That feels good.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.329
Come on, thief or thieves.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.539
Come and get me.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.376
No one would suspect a man
would spend his Christmas Eve in here.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.087
Okay, all signs point
to the Bleaken's lair

02:09.170 --> 02:10.839
being inside this warehouse.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.842
We just need to figure out
how to get in and get Mom's ornaments out.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.886
But we've looked all over this place
and there's no doors.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.140
Maybe we could go home
and make some muffins and come back.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.101
Everyone likes to open the door
to a fresh basket of muffins.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.478
That's weird,
there are footprints that lead that way,

02:25.562 --> 02:27.022
but there's nothing over there.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.066
It doesn't make any sense.
There's nothing here but a ditch.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.609
A nasty little ditch.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.279
Are you kidding me?
We came all this way and we can't get in?

02:34.362 --> 02:36.364
Hm?

02:36.448 --> 02:39.951
-What the--? You guys, this is a wall.
-Huh?

02:40.035 --> 02:43.663
Wow, someone painted a super realistic
mural on the side of this warehouse.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.790
I thought only Wile E. Coyote
could do that.

02:45.874 --> 02:46.875
Or Banksy.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.668
You guys, I think I found the door.

02:48.752 --> 02:49.919
Oh, my God, it's unlocked.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.214
Looks like the only way to go is down.

02:53.298 --> 02:58.261
My nightmare called,
it wants its scary staircase back.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.513
Okay, before we do this,
let's talk weapons.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.058
-What'd everybody bring?
-Wait, what? None.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.684
Why are we talking weapons now?

03:04.768 --> 03:07.312
There was a much better time,
back when we were near weapons.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.564
Well, I have extras. You're welcome.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.025
Okay, here's what I got.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.361
Ruler, for slapping or poking.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.029
-Or measuring.
-Pass.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.156
-Key chain, for stabbing.
-Or keys.

03:18.239 --> 03:21.242
You could also take the key chain,
and you could force it down a throat.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.036
You could sneak it into someone's mouth.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.037
-Yeah.
-What's that?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.121
Oh, keys in your mouth.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.414
What else you got?

03:26.498 --> 03:28.667
Uh, you know, Mace, knife.
But I'm keeping those.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.754
Oh. Uh, I guess I'll go ruler,
but I don't feel good about this.

03:32.837 --> 03:33.672
Shall we?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.808
Okay...

03:44.891 --> 03:45.809
Weird.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.311
Why would there be stairs
that lead to a brick wall?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.813
Maybe it's another painting?

03:49.896 --> 03:53.149
Like, maybe it's a picture of a brick wall
painted on a super easy

03:53.233 --> 03:55.944
to walk through piece of paper.
Ow. No, that feels like brick.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.780
All right, Tina said the corner
of Garfield and Jackson,

03:58.863 --> 04:00.699
but those streets don't intersect.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.367
She's not good with directions, Bob.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.702
Nobody is in our family.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.245
We're lucky we ever get anywhere.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.204
We're so stupid.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.374
- Oh, God, my babies.
- My babies are in danger, no.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.002
Lin, Lin, Lin.
Lin, let's try and stay calm.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.006
This is a totally safe area
for kids to walk around.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.967
See? Those dogs are playing,
to the death.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.051
It's all my fault.

04:20.135 --> 04:23.013
If I hadn't gotten so caught up
in my ornaments investigation,

04:23.096 --> 04:25.598
the kids wouldn't be in danger right now.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.058
-That's true.
-Bob.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.811
You're not supposed to agree with me
when I blame myself.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.230
Oh, right, then it's not your fault.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.733
Thank you. Now say it's all your fault.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.859
What? Why?

04:35.942 --> 04:36.776
-Say it.
-No.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.612
- Okay, it's both our faults.
- Fine.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.615
Well, this is Garfield and Johnson.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.492
Could she have maybe
not read it very well?

04:44.576 --> 04:46.911
We haven't bought her new glasses
since she was 6.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.831
Well, there are footprints here,
and they could be kid-sized,

04:49.914 --> 04:51.750
and there's a lot of cookie crumbs.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.209
Oh, God, no.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.919
My babies are in there.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.922
No. Why?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.844
Eh, so, no decorations thief yet.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.388
That's okay. It's a waiting game, right?

05:05.472 --> 05:08.224
Here comes nice Mrs. Chang
with her little doggy.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.517
Hello, little doggy.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.354
Hey, she's not picking it up.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.314
So she's the one that doesn't scoop.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.899
I did not suspect that.

05:15.982 --> 05:16.941
All these years.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.943
Oh! There's the smell.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.406
That's bad. Oh, that's bad.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.033
Oh, it's coming in the suit.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.744
Ugh. It's trapped in here. No, no.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.330
Don't puke in Santa. Don't puke in Santa.

05:30.413 --> 05:34.834
Ugh! We've pushed on every brick
on these stupid walls and nothing works.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.002
You hear that?

05:36.086 --> 05:38.088
-I think someone's coming.
-Everybody be quiet.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.924
It's probably the Bleaken,
or maybe one of his minions.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.009
Do you think
they call themselves "Blinions"?

05:43.093 --> 05:45.970
If they don't,
they're making a terrible mistake.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.973
You guys, I think I just realized

05:49.057 --> 05:51.851
why there's a staircase
leading to nowhere.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.853
-Why?
-To trap someone.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.273
Okay, here's the plan,

05:57.357 --> 05:59.484
we hide behind here,
and as soon as they come down,

05:59.567 --> 06:00.485
we jump them.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.028
I love the hiding part.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.571
Everybody get out your weapons.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.408
Is it too late to switch?
Great ruler here if anyone wants it.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.076
-Incredibly accurate.
-Here they come.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.160
Get them!

06:11.121 --> 06:13.039
-Oh, my God.
-Hold on. Hold on, stop, stop.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.208
-Mom? Dad?
-Kids?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.293
Oh, my baby, baby, baby, babies.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.129
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.297
Did someone just hit me in the face
with a ruler?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.049
-It was Gene.
-It hurt.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.511
Oh, did it? Cool.
I mean, shame on you. That's our father.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.513
What are you kids doing down here?

06:28.596 --> 06:29.848
Why'd you attack us?

06:29.931 --> 06:32.809
We thought you were Blinions.
How did you know where to find us?

06:32.892 --> 06:35.645
You butt-dialed us. We could hear you
talking in the background.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.605
Huh, that's funny.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.190
I wonder who it could have been.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.192
Who's got the most scared butt?

06:41.276 --> 06:42.819
Mom's got the most fierce butt.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.154
Thank you, Gene.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.115
-But Dad's is the most lived-in.
-Thank you, Gene.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.493
I did it, okay? I called Mom and Dad,
and told them where we were.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.163
-It was me. Oh.
-Uh, yeah, I figured.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.248
Well, whatever. We're all here.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.084
Maybe you guys can help us
get past this brick wall.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.713
By the way, how long did it take you guys
to figure out the door was in the mural?

07:01.796 --> 07:04.215
Way too long.
I still don't think your mom gets it.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.344
I get it, kind of. It's a mirror, right?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.054
-No.
-It is.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.932
- Oh, my God, what was that?
- You guys, look.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.353
That step is rattling,
like it's hollow or something.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.313
Huh, that's odd.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.814
Dad, help me lift this up.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.483
Easy, Bob, easy. Your back.

07:21.566 --> 07:25.278
-Lift with your legs, you're so frail.
-Oh, my God. Why are we doing this?

07:26.071 --> 07:29.115
Whoa, a secret staircase
inside a staircase.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.409
It's an architectural turducken.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.370
Mm-hm. Yeah, that's great.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.038
-Uh, now let's go home.
-What?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.664
No way. We came this far.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.874
We can't turn back now.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.876
We're so close to finding the Bleaken.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.088
Louise, the Bleaken isn't real,
and he didn't steal Mom's ornaments.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.132
Okay, fine. Then how do you explain this?

07:46.216 --> 07:48.468
- One of my ornaments.
- What the...?

07:48.551 --> 07:49.886
Where did you kids find this?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.846
Here.
That's what we're trying to tell you.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.517
A map of the robberies led us
to this area, and then we followed a trail

07:55.600 --> 07:58.395
of black feathers and footprints
into this building.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.357
-Obviously, something is going on.
-Where there's smoke, there are feathers.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.859
Listen, kids, I'm glad you found
one of the ornaments,

08:04.943 --> 08:06.695
and I am really glad you're okay,

08:06.778 --> 08:10.031
but there's no way we're spending
Christmas Eve in a dark, scary warehouse.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.616
-Right, Lin?
-Here's the thing, Bob.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.201
-Oh, no.
-I'm not saying the Bleaken

08:13.284 --> 08:14.119
took my ornaments,

08:14.202 --> 08:15.995
-because it could have been anyone.
-Right.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.915
But somebody stole them.
And it sure seems like the kids are right.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.459
That whoever stole them
is inside this building right here,

08:21.543 --> 08:23.003
the one we're standing in.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.131
-So, I'm staying till I find my ornaments.
-Yes.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.341
-But you can take the kids home.
-What, wait, what?

08:28.425 --> 08:29.592
I'm not leaving you here.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.845
-Neither am I.
-I think she'll be fine.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.139
-Wait, I'm staying with Mom.
-Me, too.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.558
Who said she'll be fine?
That sounded cowardly.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.144
Okay, we'll try and find
whoever stole the ornaments.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.062
-The Bleaken.
-Not the Bleaken.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.480
But you all stay behind me,

08:42.564 --> 08:45.817
and we leave in 20 minutes,
no matter what. Tina, give me the ruler.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.235
-No.
-Tina.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.446
-Fine. Let me show you how to use it.
-Ow!

08:51.114 --> 08:52.615
I can't believe we're doing this.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.618
Such a bad idea. Such a bad idea.
Such a bad idea.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.912
That's great, Dad, great for morale.
Keep it up.

Because we can turn back.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.413
Some jerk has my tree, Bob.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.291
Yeah, Dad, and that jerk
happens to be a ferocious,

09:43.375 --> 09:47.087
mystical beast who's trying
to ruin the holiday, just FYI.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.798
Everyone's being really rational.
This is great.

-That's not good.
-Nobody panic.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.943
We'll just wait
till the lights come back on.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.027
Or until we're killed.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.787
-What the heck was that thing?
-It was a--

10:20.870 --> 10:22.122
It was a...

10:22.205 --> 10:25.125
What do you think it was?
It was the frickin' Bleaken!

10:25.208 --> 10:27.127
Okay, we should definitely turn back.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.462
Bob, that thing can be explained.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.797
I don't know how, but it can.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.300
We got to keep going. It's like IKEA.
We can't go back. We got to push forward.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.553
Watch out for Swedish meatballs.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.682
Oh, okay, fine, we'll go toward the thing
with feathers and the deer head.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.399
Okay, I'm gonna open this a crack,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.776
even though every part of me
tells me not to do this.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.819
Everyone stand back.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.531
Oh, you're standing way back. That's good.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.743
What is it? What do you see?

10:59.826 --> 11:03.288
It's, uh, not what I expected.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.248
It's not a horrible pit of death?

11:05.874 --> 11:08.460
I mean, it depends on how
you feel about trance music.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.004
Is this Moby's house?

11:11.087 --> 11:14.424
Oh, it's a... rave.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.759
Yup. Just a rave.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.345
Whoever these people are,
they have a lot of creative ideas.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.847
Like the illusion wall
and the secret staircase.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.474
So instead of the Bleaken's nest,

11:22.557 --> 11:25.060
we get a bunch of people
dancing like nobody's watching?

11:25.143 --> 11:25.977
What a rip-off.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.606
- Look.
- Whoa. Mom's tree.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.524
Everyone, we're leaving in a second.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.110
Right after
I get my frickin' treetop back.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.780
Mom is literally raving mad.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.079
-I bet all this stuff is stolen.
-Yeah.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.374
-And that guy stole my dance move.
-I think that's the reading reindeer

11:47.457 --> 11:50.043
from in front of the library,
I recognize his glasses.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.045
Stupid young people.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.547
They think they can just take things
for their fancy rave.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.466
Don't worry,
we're gonna get your tree back.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.593
I mean, it's really high up, but...

11:58.677 --> 12:01.221
Hey, everyone. DJ Elev-8 here.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.098
That's spelled with the number eight.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.393
And this is asinine with the number nine.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.437
Just a few minutes left
until the clock strikes midnight

12:09.521 --> 12:11.356
and it's officially Christmas morning.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.024
You all know what that means.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.151
It's time to elev-8.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.030
-Unbelievable.
-Okay, I think if we just

12:19.114 --> 12:21.408
quietly and inconspicuously
make our way over to--

12:21.491 --> 12:24.577
I'm gonna get on that microphone
and give these people a piece of my mind.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.788
-Please don't do that, Lin.
-Please do that, Mom.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.289
Bob, you go get my treetop.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.834
Kids, you stand underneath your father
in case he falls.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.293
I got a party to poop on.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.170
Oh, my God, that's so high up.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.339
Okay. I can't take the smell anymore.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.008
I gotta move away from the dog poop.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.052
Damn it. Oh, whoa, oh, whoa.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.181
Just gotta get my arms under me,
like a push-up.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.516
Just gotta do one push-up.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.227
What's wrong with me?

12:49.310 --> 12:52.689
I can't do one push-up?

12:56.109 --> 12:59.654
Oh, God.
This is really the stupidest way to die.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.781
Don't worry, Dad. You're not gonna die.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.658
If you fall,
it would be a tough road back,

13:03.742 --> 13:04.826
but you're not gonna die.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.370
Yeah, I bet Santa
falls off roofs all the time,

13:07.454 --> 13:09.831
and he's only in slightly
better shape than you.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.709
Just for the record,
your butt crack's not totally out.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.003
I know it, I feel it. I feel the breeze.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.090
Hello. Hello, people.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.842
Uh, can I have your attention, please?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.427
Hey. What the--? Get off of that.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.220
-Give it to me.
-What are you doing?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.431
I'm killing that mic.
Where's that damn switch?

13:26.514 --> 13:29.392
I know you're all having a fun time
in your little rave cave,

13:29.476 --> 13:30.769
but I need to say something.

13:30.852 --> 13:35.398
Normally, I would love to be doing
a rave with you, but this is bullcrap.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.275
This is not what Christmas is about.

13:37.359 --> 13:40.445
It's not about stealing things,
and secret tunnels.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.530
We don't have a permit for this.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.240
That's why we have all those things.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.492
To keep people out.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.451
Who brought her?

13:46.534 --> 13:48.286
And no one stole anything.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.705
Oh, go play ping pong with your ding dong.

13:50.789 --> 13:53.041
You know what you did,
you Christmas burglars.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.709
Look, you took my treetop.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.462
-Uh, hi.
-So we're taking it back.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.713
And my ornaments.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.382
But you know what I can't get back?

14:00.465 --> 14:01.841
My Christmas spirit.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.969
What's happening?
What is that?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.353
Whoa.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.854
Hello.

14:14.938 --> 14:18.817
Most of the year,
you know me as Cleavage To Beaver.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.903
But it's Christmas,
so tonight, I'm Miss Triple X-Mas.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.446
Welcome to our party.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.491
I'm not sure what this grumpy lady
is yelling about, but it's midnight.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.827
So I'm gonna sing my Christmas song.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.247

Excuse me. Hi.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.982
You're, uh, not the Bleaken, are you?

15:41.066 --> 15:43.401
No. I'm a person. In a costume.

15:43.485 --> 15:47.072
Well, just so you know,
we could've taken him. Right, guys?

15:47.155 --> 15:49.824
Yeah. We would've sent him back
to Bleakentown.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.203
I had a ruler. I really don't know
how it would've gone down.

15:55.121 --> 15:55.955
Oh, not again.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.333
Wait, wait, wait. Don't turn me off.
I wanna apologize.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.752
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.420
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

16:02.504 --> 16:05.840
I didn't realize
how wonderful this party was.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.300
I couldn't see you.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.677
I thought you were dumb kids.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.594
I'm 23.

16:09.678 --> 16:13.556
I thought Christmas gave up on me,
but maybe I gave up on Christmas.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.350
Can you tell us all this later?

16:15.433 --> 16:19.145
Wait, wait, listen.
I have to confess something. Uh...

16:19.229 --> 16:21.648
Something I did that I feel
really, really bad about

16:21.731 --> 16:22.941
and now I wish I could undo.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.318
I called the cops
and told them the thieves are here

16:25.402 --> 16:27.821
-and they're on their way. I'm sorry.
-Oh, no.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.323
You called the cops?
They're gonna shut us down.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.576
I know. I'm so sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.578
-Hi, Marshmallow.
-Uh-uh.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.874
I'm sorry I called the cops.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.292
I feel terrible.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.254
It was dark, and I couldn't see
all your beautiful faces.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.007
You called the cops
and ruined our Christmas party.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.175
This party is all I have.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.385
Okay, I'll be honest,

16:50.468 --> 16:53.972
I have a couple different things going
on tonight, so I was gonna leave early,

16:54.055 --> 16:56.307
-but this is still not cool, Linda.
-Okay, I admit it.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.392
I ruined your party.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.685
I just got so mad.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.062
I freaked out
because you stole my ornaments.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.481
For the last time, lady,
we didn't steal your ornaments.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.649
Well, someone did.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.192
I did.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.903
Art, the naked artist guy?

17:08.987 --> 17:10.113
I confess.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.616
I stole your tree and these lights,
and I did it by myself.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.077
Don't blame anyone else here,
it was all me.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.163
And to think I gave you drugs.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.748
But why?

17:19.831 --> 17:22.125
I was put in charge of decorations.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.710
I didn't have any money.

17:23.793 --> 17:27.505
And I didn't think it was hurting anyone
if I borrowed a few things here and there.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.049
I borrowed them, kind of.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.717
And then I put all this up.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.136
-Oh, it is beautiful.
-Oh, I know.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.637
So how'd you boost our spruce?

17:34.721 --> 17:37.766
I hid it in the Dumpster in your alley
when I left your party.

17:37.849 --> 17:42.937
- You threw my tree in a Dumpster?
- I placed it in the Dumpster,

17:43.021 --> 17:44.022
very carefully.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.648
Right next to some old meat.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.818
And then, after I finished my nuding,
I came back for it.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.654
It's just, this party's usually
at The Wiggle Room,

17:51.738 --> 17:53.281
and it always looks amazing.

17:53.365 --> 17:56.659
And I know it's important
to a lot of people, and I just--

17:57.369 --> 18:00.455
I had a dream of making it
look beautiful in here,

18:00.538 --> 18:02.624
to bring people a little bit of light.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.835
I had the exact same dream.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.796
That's why I threw my Christmas party.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.589
This one was way better though.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.591
They were both good. Who's to say?

18:11.675 --> 18:12.592
-I mean...
-Well, I--

18:12.676 --> 18:14.678
They're here. The cops are outside!

18:14.761 --> 18:17.097
Well, I guess that's that.
Party's over.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.265
Oh, my God,
I am so late for this next thing.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.851
I would bring you all,
but I don't even have a plus-one,

18:21.935 --> 18:24.813
so I doubt it would be cool
to show up with, like, 500 people.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.856
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.526
-This party's not over.
-Bob, what do you mean?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.529
Look, we called the cops.
I mean, you called the cops.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.282
I never would've done that.
The least we can do is save the party.

18:36.366 --> 18:39.077
I have a plan. I just need that costume.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.995
Dad's about to get horny.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.998
Where's the god-dang door?

18:44.082 --> 18:44.916
Hey.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.710
-What the...?
-Over here.

18:46.793 --> 18:47.961
I'm the Christmas thief.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.880
The Bleaken is real. Come and get me.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.759
Oh, hit him with the car.
This will be fun. Do it.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.304
It worked. They're chasing him.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.432
The cops left. Party back on.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.728
Yeah. All right.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.690
I'm up. Stronger than ever.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.862
I think I lost them.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.490
Oh, my God, the Bleaken's real.

19:21.036 --> 19:22.746
-Bleaken?
-Santa?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.080
-Bob?
-Teddy?

19:24.164 --> 19:27.208
Oh, thank God, I thought you were--
What are you doing?

19:27.292 --> 19:30.295
It's a long story.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.254
Eh, same.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.757
It all started earlier,
when I heard from Bosco, that--

19:33.840 --> 19:35.300
-Uh-oh. They're coming.
-Wait.

19:35.383 --> 19:39.012
-You running from the cops?
-Yeah. Very much. I need to hide.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.182
-Turns out, I'm bad at that.
-I think I got the perfect place.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.270
We lost him. Oh, well.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.981
How about we get lost
in some Kung Pao chicken?

19:50.065 --> 19:52.692
This is a great idea.
I knew we could both fit in here.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.069
-We can kind of fit.
-Yeah.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.571
-I mean, it's a little snug.
-Shh.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.406
Wait. Aren't we in front of your house?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.784
-Couldn't we have just gone in there?
-Shh.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.660
-Teddy. Aren't we right in--?
-Shh.

20:02.744 --> 20:03.787
-Why do you keep--?
-Shh.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.747
-Teddy. Why do you keep shushing me?
-What?

20:05.830 --> 20:08.750
-I thought I heard something. Oh, sorry.
-Yeah. So stop doing that.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.835
That's why I'm trying to
stop you from talking.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.921
Why? Because I'm--
I have something to say.

20:13.004 --> 20:13.922
Yeah, what? Yeah.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.383
I said, we don't need to hide here,
we could go...

20:16.466 --> 20:18.176
-Shh. What?
-I'm leaving.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.219
-Don't go.
-Good-bye.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.136
No, don't go.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.389
-Let go of me.
-This is the best Christmas Eve ever.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.306
Don't ruin it.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.727
Well, I guess there's no Bleaken.
I kind of wanted to fight him.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.814
Maybe there is a Bleaken.
Maybe we scared him away

20:30.897 --> 20:33.274
with our tough, badass,
positive, can-do attitude.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.443
You might be right. I mean, look at Mom.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.946
I love Christmas!

20:39.614 --> 20:41.658
I love Christmas!

20:41.741 --> 20:43.743
-Mom, did you sleep?
-She hasn't even sat down.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.329
Somebody gave me a little something
at the party.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.330
I feel amazing.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.124
Hold on, I gotta lie down for a second.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.087
Isn't she an angel when she sleeps?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.714
Well, Merry Christmas, everybody.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.341
I'm just gonna, uh, feel her pulse.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.843
Yeah, she's okay. She's fine.
