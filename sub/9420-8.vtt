WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:10.943
>> We are getting close.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.378
>> How you feeling?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.480
>> Do I thank the girl for not

00:14.482 --> 00:15.881
letting me walk into that street

00:15.883 --> 00:16.582
that day I wanted to end

00:16.584 --> 00:17.483
my life?

00:17.485 --> 00:18.884
>> Keep in mind that she's

00:18.886 --> 00:20.319
probably more nervous

00:20.321 --> 00:23.122
and freaked out than you are.

00:23.124 --> 00:23.789
>> Yeah.

00:23.791 --> 00:24.590
>> Unless she comes--

00:24.592 --> 00:26.025
Oh, is that the red--

00:26.027 --> 00:26.792
Oh, look--

00:26.794 --> 00:27.493
>> That's her dad.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.160
>> The red truck--

00:28.162 --> 00:28.894
it's coming home.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.062
>> Whoa.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.463
>> Oh, my God.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.432
Like, this is really happening.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.534
>> She could be playing

00:35.536 --> 00:37.936
a very dark, twisted game.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.872
>> Hello.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.306
Where's the coffee?

00:41.308 --> 00:42.207
>> All right, well, let's find

00:42.209 --> 00:44.810
out who needs our help.

00:44.812 --> 00:45.577
We have an email here

00:45.579 --> 00:46.812
from Superman.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.647
>> Is Superman a catfish?

00:48.649 --> 00:49.548
>> Well, no, the question is,

00:49.550 --> 00:51.650
"Which is the real version?"

00:51.652 --> 00:53.619
He is really Superman.

00:53.621 --> 00:54.720
He poses as Clark Kent.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.288
So Superman's the catfish.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.122
>> Right, Superman

00:57.124 --> 00:58.557
is the catfish, and Clark Kent

00:58.559 --> 00:59.691
is the mask.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.060
>> Anyway, the subject

01:01.062 --> 01:05.330
is "Catfished or Kidnapped"

01:05.331 --> 01:06.598
"Hey, Nev and Max.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.666
My name is Blaire.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.501
I'm 22 and currently live

01:09.503 --> 01:11.870
in San Antonio, Texas.

01:11.872 --> 01:12.738
I just moved here

01:12.740 --> 01:14.606
with my best friend, Terah,

01:14.608 --> 01:15.541
around two months ago.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.076
I'm originally from New York

01:17.078 --> 01:18.043
and when I was there,

01:18.045 --> 01:19.178
I met an amazing girl

01:19.180 --> 01:21.046
named Markie from Fresno,

01:21.048 --> 01:22.881
California, on Instagram.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.650
We started talking immediately

01:24.652 --> 01:27.586
and had an amazing connection.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.720
When I first met Markie,

01:28.722 --> 01:30.722
I was basically homeless.

01:30.724 --> 01:31.824
I did not see eye to eye with

01:31.826 --> 01:33.625
my parents about anything, and

01:33.627 --> 01:34.860
I was kicked out with nothing

01:34.862 --> 01:35.961
but the clothes on my back.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.696
Markie is really the only person

01:37.698 --> 01:38.430
who helped me out

01:38.432 --> 01:39.398
of that dark place.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.833
>> ♪ Stand by me ♪

01:40.835 --> 01:44.103
♪ And I'll stand by you ♪

01:44.105 --> 01:45.604
>> We poured our hearts out

01:45.606 --> 01:46.572
to each other.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.639
She gave me a purpose

01:47.641 --> 01:49.875
and a reason not to end my life.

01:49.877 --> 01:53.779
>> ♪ Let your heart go boom ♪

01:53.781 --> 01:56.682
♪ Let your heart go boom ♪

01:56.684 --> 01:58.050
>> She was my girlfriend.

01:58.052 --> 01:59.518
I loved her completely,

01:59.520 --> 02:01.520
and I trusted no one but her.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.122
>> ♪ Boom ♪

02:03.124 --> 02:04.756
>> But we never got the chance

02:04.758 --> 02:05.791
to video chat.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.826
I asked all the time.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.461
Around four months after meeting

02:09.463 --> 02:11.130
online, we decided to meet

02:11.132 --> 02:12.464
in person.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.266
Problem is, a week before I was

02:14.268 --> 02:15.334
supposed to meet her,

02:15.336 --> 02:18.337
she got kidnapped.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.139
A week after that, she calls me

02:20.141 --> 02:21.874
from a mental hospital?

02:21.876 --> 02:23.308
And Markie decided it was best

02:23.310 --> 02:24.910
if we were just friends.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.345
I was completely devastated

02:26.347 --> 02:27.379
and never found out

02:27.381 --> 02:29.314
what really happened."

02:29.316 --> 02:30.115
Can we just talk about this?

02:30.117 --> 02:30.782
>> Yeah, okay.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.217
This is a pretty wild story.

02:32.219 --> 02:32.951
>> It sounds sort

02:32.953 --> 02:33.785
of preposterous

02:33.787 --> 02:35.454
that this Markie girl

02:35.456 --> 02:36.488
got kidnapped and then ended up

02:36.490 --> 02:37.890
in a mental hospital.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.024
>> This sounds more like kind

02:39.026 --> 02:39.825
of the front page

02:39.827 --> 02:41.860
of a supermarket tabloid.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.462
>> "A few weeks ago,

02:43.464 --> 02:45.063
I met a great girl.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.198
We started dating,

02:46.200 --> 02:48.534
and I posted this on Facebook.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.935
Markie yelled at me on Facebook

02:49.937 --> 02:50.802
to call her.

02:50.804 --> 02:51.503
She told me I should not

02:51.505 --> 02:52.804
date anyone, but she doesn't

02:52.806 --> 02:55.007
want to date me either.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.308
I'm so confused.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.109
I want to move on,

02:57.111 --> 02:58.577
but something holds me back.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.045
Save me, guys!

03:00.047 --> 03:01.280
Blaire."

03:01.282 --> 03:03.782
So now Blaire is dating someone.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.449
>> And then, boom.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.617
>> And Markie shows up

03:05.619 --> 03:06.718
and yells at her.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.686
>> It's unfair.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.487
>> We definitely need to find

03:08.489 --> 03:09.454
out more about this.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.523
[line ringing]

03:11.525 --> 03:12.624
>> both: Hey.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.492
>> Hello.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.927
>> How you doing, Blaire?

03:14.929 --> 03:15.861
>> Good, how are you?

03:15.863 --> 03:16.895
>> I have to admit, we thought

03:16.897 --> 03:18.096
we were getting an email

03:18.098 --> 03:19.598
from Superman.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.365
>> What's the connection

03:20.367 --> 03:21.166
to Superman?

03:21.168 --> 03:21.934
>> Everything that I've

03:21.936 --> 03:22.834
came through made me, like,

03:22.836 --> 03:25.070
stronger, so the girl of steel.

03:25.072 --> 03:25.837
>> How are things going

03:25.839 --> 03:26.505
in San Antonio?

03:26.507 --> 03:27.439
What's going on?

03:27.441 --> 03:28.340
>> I'm living with my best

03:28.342 --> 03:30.576
friend, Terah, and her nephew.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.543
We're in a hotel.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.678
Hopefully getting an apartment

03:32.680 --> 03:33.412
soon.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.246
I'm in the process

03:34.248 --> 03:35.480
of getting a job.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.915
It's just really hard to deal

03:36.917 --> 03:38.817
with, like, the money situation.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.219
That's really my life

03:40.221 --> 03:41.486
at this point.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.022
>> So at what point did Markie

03:44.024 --> 03:45.157
come into your life?

03:45.159 --> 03:47.492
>> I met Markie when I became

03:47.494 --> 03:48.794
homeless.

03:48.796 --> 03:49.795
I had nothing.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.563
I was living in my friend's car.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.366
I was a mess, and when she

03:54.368 --> 03:56.401
came in my life, I went out,

03:56.403 --> 03:58.103
I got an apartment, a job,

03:58.105 --> 03:59.137
and she was the reason why,

03:59.139 --> 04:00.138
'cause I wanted to see her,

04:00.140 --> 04:01.340
and I wanted to get her

04:01.342 --> 04:02.374
a ticket.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.242
>> Before you moved, you were

04:03.244 --> 04:04.676
supposed to meet in New York.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.444
>> Yeah.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.278
>> And then...

04:06.280 --> 04:08.580
>> She gets kidnapped.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.015
>> She just kind of fell off

04:10.017 --> 04:10.749
the grid?

04:10.751 --> 04:11.950
>> Yeah, like, a few days,

04:11.952 --> 04:13.018
I haven't heard from her.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.386
I get a message from her sister

04:14.388 --> 04:15.220
asking me,

04:15.222 --> 04:16.321
"Have you seen Markie?

04:16.322 --> 04:17.923
She hasn't been seen in,

04:17.925 --> 04:19.057
like, the past few days."

04:19.059 --> 04:19.992
I was devastated.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.860
I was crying, panicking.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.495
I was thinking the worst.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.162
>> Did she explain

04:24.164 --> 04:25.030
what happened?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.398
>> She basically tells me,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.332
"I was kidnapped.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.333
I'm in a hospital,"

04:28.335 --> 04:29.234
and that she doesn't want to be

04:29.236 --> 04:30.202
in a relationship anymore

04:30.204 --> 04:31.069
'cause she still has feelings

04:31.071 --> 04:33.305
for her ex.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.073
>> Markie does not sound

04:35.075 --> 04:36.341
like the kind of person

04:36.343 --> 04:38.143
who you should be with.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.845
>> You're probably 100% right,

04:39.847 --> 04:40.712
but I think it's the fact

04:40.714 --> 04:42.014
that she was the only one

04:42.016 --> 04:42.681
that was there for me

04:42.683 --> 04:44.383
when I really needed someone.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.917
I was living out of a car

04:45.919 --> 04:47.185
in the middle of winter.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.453
Who are you that you saved

04:48.455 --> 04:49.554
my life?

04:49.556 --> 04:50.689
I need to be able to move on

04:50.691 --> 04:52.491
and be happy, and knowing

04:52.493 --> 04:53.992
what really happened with her

04:53.994 --> 04:55.427
is gonna give me that.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.962
Deep inside, I know that

04:56.964 --> 04:58.497
I do have feelings for her also,

04:58.499 --> 04:59.698
and I want to know the person

04:59.700 --> 05:00.799
that I was in love with and if

05:00.801 --> 05:02.367
I am still in love with her.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.168
>> I feel like you deserve

05:03.170 --> 05:04.403
a break.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.671
We want to come and help you

05:05.673 --> 05:07.339
find out what really happened

05:07.341 --> 05:08.940
and see if you can figure out

05:08.942 --> 05:10.742
what the future looks like.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.576
>> Well, I would love

05:11.578 --> 05:12.444
your guys' help.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.211
>> All right, hang in there,

05:13.213 --> 05:14.112
and we'll see you really soon.

05:14.114 --> 05:14.846
Bye, Blaire.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.048
>> Bye.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.149
>> Gee whiz.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.150
I mean, this is way more

05:18.152 --> 05:20.285
than just a catfish story.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.689
>> Back to Texas.

05:40.941 --> 05:41.290
at the hotel she lives in.

05:41.291 --> 05:41.640
Definitely have to hand

05:41.642 --> 05:42.274
it to her.

05:42.276 --> 05:43.442
Given nothing, she's figured

05:43.444 --> 05:44.910
out a way to cobble together

05:44.912 --> 05:45.911
her life.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.012
This is it.

05:47.014 --> 05:47.679
Hey!

05:47.681 --> 05:48.447
>> Hello.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.114
>> How are you?

05:49.116 --> 05:50.082
>> I'm good. How are you?

05:50.084 --> 05:51.083
>> Come on, guys.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.117
I like what you've done here.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.785
>> Here's my living room,

05:53.787 --> 05:55.053
kitchen thing.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.254
>> How is it living here?

05:56.256 --> 05:57.522
>> It's a roof over your head.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.657
You have a bed, a blanket,

05:58.659 --> 05:59.324
and a heater.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.325
What else do you need?

06:00.327 --> 06:01.760
I'd been living in cars before,

06:01.762 --> 06:04.563
so this is a big upgrade.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.297
>> What's, uh--

06:05.299 --> 06:06.398
>> That's Ja'Kayden.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.366
That's the baby.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.735
He is really my world.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.802
With him not having a mother

06:10.804 --> 06:12.537
or a father around, that's me

06:12.539 --> 06:13.872
and Terah's role right now.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.639
>> When you met her,

06:14.641 --> 06:15.841
was it a romantic thing?

06:15.843 --> 06:16.508
Were you guys--

06:16.510 --> 06:17.876
>> There was flirting, but we

06:17.878 --> 06:18.877
came to the conclusion we're,

06:18.879 --> 06:20.512
like, better friends.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.180
And she's my backbone through

06:22.182 --> 06:22.948
what I'm going through

06:22.950 --> 06:24.116
right now.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.417
Me and my family never seen

06:25.419 --> 06:27.352
eye to eye, and they basically

06:27.354 --> 06:29.221
said, "Get out of my house."

06:29.223 --> 06:30.422
>> So you have a friend

06:30.424 --> 06:31.590
who lets you stay in their car?

06:31.592 --> 06:32.791
>> Yeah, I stayed in his car

06:32.793 --> 06:33.859
for a few nights.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.227
>> And then, like, what happens?

06:35.229 --> 06:36.962
>> That's when I meet Markie.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.296
>> Was it all texting?

06:38.298 --> 06:39.631
>> I tried to Skype with her,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.133
but she would always avoid it.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.367
So it was just no point.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.168
>> What are you thinking

06:43.170 --> 06:44.169
you're gonna do at this point?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.303
Like, are you looking for a job?

06:45.305 --> 06:45.971
Are you, like--

06:45.973 --> 06:46.838
>> At that point, honestly,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.241
I thought I was gonna be dead...

06:49.243 --> 06:50.041
'cause I'm just gonna

06:50.043 --> 06:50.976
kill myself.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.644
>> This is the time in your life

06:52.646 --> 06:53.512
when, obviously, things are

06:53.514 --> 06:54.613
worst, and you're thinking,

06:54.615 --> 06:57.849
like, "It might just be better

06:57.851 --> 06:58.717
to--"

06:58.719 --> 07:00.118
>> Just end it, yeah.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.554
There was a freeway.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.389
And it was always cars going,

07:04.391 --> 07:05.791
like, 70, so I was just gonna

07:05.793 --> 07:08.226
walk into the traffic.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.329
And then Markie would call.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.531
And she happened to just call

07:12.533 --> 07:13.498
every time I was gonna do

07:13.500 --> 07:14.833
something stupid.

07:14.835 --> 07:15.867
So she, like, literally

07:15.869 --> 07:17.135
saved my life.

07:17.137 --> 07:17.869
>> And what would you guys

07:17.871 --> 07:18.737
talk about?

07:18.739 --> 07:19.471
>> Everything.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.906
She didn't have it easy either.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.507
Her brother passed away.

07:22.509 --> 07:23.442
Her and her dad have not

07:23.444 --> 07:24.543
always gotten along.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.811
She was always making me laugh,

07:25.813 --> 07:26.945
and that's, like, what I needed.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.647
It was like a new light

07:28.649 --> 07:29.781
inside me.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.850
I got a job, I was saving money,

07:31.852 --> 07:34.052
and without her, who knows

07:34.054 --> 07:36.288
if we'd even be sitting here?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.056
I saved money from work,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.458
and I bought her a plane ticket

07:39.460 --> 07:41.226
from California to New York.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.093
And then no one knows

07:42.095 --> 07:42.761
where she is.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.429
The cops are looking for her.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.897
I called her dad, and I was

07:45.899 --> 07:47.399
basically like, "Where is she?"

07:47.401 --> 07:48.366
And he's like, "Well, I'm not

07:48.368 --> 07:48.967
gonna get into it,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.368
but she's not coming."

07:50.370 --> 07:52.370
It's like she just disappeared.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.872
Then, recently, I had myself

07:53.874 --> 07:55.507
a girlfriend, Katarina,

07:55.509 --> 07:57.242
and I put it on Facebook,

07:57.244 --> 07:58.510
and Markie was like,

07:58.512 --> 07:59.845
"You can't have a girlfriend,

07:59.847 --> 08:00.512
but I don't want

08:00.514 --> 08:01.413
to be with you."

08:01.415 --> 08:02.781
>> [exhales deeply]

08:02.783 --> 08:03.715
Roller coaster.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.250
>> Pretty much.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.318
>> I'd like to know a little

08:06.320 --> 08:08.153
bit more about Markie,

08:08.155 --> 08:08.820
if that's cool.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.222
>> Yeah.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.122
>> She's cute.

08:11.124 --> 08:11.857
>> She's got, like,

08:11.859 --> 08:13.625
a pretty full account.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.893
Like, lots of profile pictures

08:14.895 --> 08:15.927
over the years.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.829
2,011 friends--

08:17.831 --> 08:18.830
that's a lot of friends.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.531
People have liked

08:19.533 --> 08:21.366
and commented for a long time.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.767
Her look has changed a bunch,

08:22.769 --> 08:24.603
but it's clearly her.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.403
>> This is a pretty

08:25.405 --> 08:26.605
real-looking page.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.607
>> Yeah.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.575
>> Do you believe that getting

08:30.577 --> 08:32.143
an explanation from Markie

08:32.145 --> 08:33.812
could spark your relationship

08:33.813 --> 08:34.846
with her again?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.014
>> It all comes down to, like,

08:36.015 --> 08:36.815
what the truth is.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.450
I mean, why would you pull me

08:38.452 --> 08:39.851
out of such a bad spot,

08:39.852 --> 08:41.219
make me so happy, and throw me

08:41.221 --> 08:42.486
back in the hole?

08:42.489 --> 08:43.255
And I don't want to have

08:43.256 --> 08:44.723
to ask why anymore.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.157
I want to know the reason.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.025
>> I think you need to think

08:47.027 --> 08:49.728
about what opening this door

08:49.730 --> 08:51.263
is really going to bring.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.197
>> Whichever way it goes, I'll

08:52.199 --> 08:53.365
just have to pick myself up,

08:53.367 --> 08:54.933
dust my shoulders off,

08:54.935 --> 08:56.568
and keep moving.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.903
>> You've done that before.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.004
>> Yes, I have, and I can do

08:59.006 --> 08:59.738
it one more time.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.439
[chuckles]

09:01.441 --> 09:02.541
>> Okay.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.708
Hopefully we'll get you

09:03.710 --> 09:04.543
some answers.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.310
Good to meet you.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.077
>> You too.

09:06.079 --> 09:06.778
>> Later, Blaire.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.445
See ya.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.180
>> Bye, thank you.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.916
>> Life is complicated

09:10.918 --> 09:11.583
for Blaire.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.551
>> Nothing is simple for her.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.085
Markie is more than just a girl

09:14.087 --> 09:14.819
that she was in love with.

09:14.821 --> 09:15.520
>> Right.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.755
>> It's a girl who totally

09:16.757 --> 09:18.890
reset her perspective on life.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.691
>> Which is why I think

09:19.693 --> 09:20.859
it's important for Blaire

09:20.861 --> 09:23.028
to believe that Markie

09:23.030 --> 09:24.896
is a good person.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.697
>> When we find out

09:25.699 --> 09:26.398
what really happened,

09:26.400 --> 09:27.532
the kidnapping story

09:27.534 --> 09:29.200
is gonna seem light.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.168
I think it could be much,

09:30.170 --> 09:32.604
much darker than that.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.610
>> Oh, pancakes.
>> Surfing the Web

09:38.612 --> 09:39.945
>> Surfing the Web

09:39.946 --> 09:41.279
>> It's a beer garden.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.614
>> All right, pancakes and beer,

09:42.616 --> 09:44.049
please.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.483
All right, so we're dealing

09:45.485 --> 09:47.018
with a very sensitive situation

09:47.020 --> 09:48.753
here, because we've got Blaire,

09:48.755 --> 09:50.488
who had a very difficult

09:50.490 --> 09:51.523
past couple of years.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.525
>> And on the verge of suicide,

09:53.527 --> 09:55.727
she meets Markie on Instagram...

09:55.729 --> 09:57.195
>> Yeah, on Instagram.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.630
>> Who pulled her out

09:58.632 --> 10:00.298
of her depression, saved her.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.633
A week before they were going

10:01.635 --> 10:03.735
to meet in New York after Blaire

10:03.737 --> 10:04.836
bought a plane ticket

10:04.838 --> 10:06.104
for Markie,

10:06.106 --> 10:07.872
Markie gets kidnapped.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.175
And then a week later, she calls

10:10.177 --> 10:12.243
from a mental institution.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.878
>> And she says, "I'm not

10:13.880 --> 10:14.980
into you right now."

10:14.982 --> 10:16.948
No explanation, nothing.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.049
Let's do a couple image

10:18.051 --> 10:19.017
searches quickly.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.218
Let's see if any of Markie's

10:20.220 --> 10:22.887
pictures hits.

10:22.889 --> 10:23.755
No.

10:23.757 --> 10:24.556
All right, here, there's

10:24.558 --> 10:25.924
another one we can try.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.058
None of the pictures

10:27.060 --> 10:28.493
are coming back with any hits.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.161
>> Well, it seems like Markie

10:30.163 --> 10:32.030
might be exactly who she says

10:32.032 --> 10:33.798
she is, but when the story

10:33.800 --> 10:35.233
checks out, then there's

10:35.235 --> 10:37.235
generally a much more sinister

10:37.237 --> 10:39.537
reason why they're not meeting.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.006
>> Let's run Markie's

10:41.008 --> 10:42.073
phone number.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.242
Here we go.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.543
>> Oh.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.778
>> We have an address--

10:46.780 --> 10:48.847
Clovis, California.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.215
So that's promising.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.282
We can use that.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.684
Markie was allegedly

10:52.686 --> 10:54.285
kidnapped back in July.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.253
So I want to see what was

10:55.255 --> 10:56.421
going on on her Facebook page

10:56.423 --> 10:57.455
back then.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.957
Okay, here we go.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.091
July 4th.

11:00.093 --> 11:00.759
>> Whoa.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.426
>> Whoa.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.193
>> Yeah, look at that one--

11:02.195 --> 11:02.761
all caps.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.495
>> "Does anyone know where

11:03.497 --> 11:04.729
Markie is or could be?

11:04.731 --> 11:05.430
She was supposed to be

11:05.432 --> 11:06.197
home yesterday.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.198
Please contact me

11:07.200 --> 11:08.266
with what you know."

11:08.268 --> 11:09.000
>> So that was July 4th.

11:09.002 --> 11:09.801
>> Then July 5th--

11:09.803 --> 11:10.902
"Markie is still missing.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.037
If you know anything,

11:12.039 --> 11:12.871
please message me."

11:12.873 --> 11:13.605
And then two days later,

11:13.607 --> 11:14.272
"I love you, Markie,

11:14.274 --> 11:15.173
and I'm glad you're safe."

11:15.175 --> 11:17.842
>> So by the 7th, she's safe.

11:17.844 --> 11:18.777
>> And then here's Blaire's

11:18.779 --> 11:19.778
post on the 10th.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.812
"Call me. I need to know

11:20.814 --> 11:22.547
what's going on asap, please,"

11:22.549 --> 11:23.715
because she was supposed to fly

11:23.717 --> 11:24.516
out on the 11th.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.183
>> Yeah.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.384
So Blaire's freaking out.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.852
>> Look, on the 14th,

11:27.854 --> 11:29.688
she changed her profile picture.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.922
But this was the exact time that

11:30.924 --> 11:32.724
she was apparently not okay.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.292
She had just been kidnapped,

11:34.294 --> 11:35.460
held hostage, and now

11:35.462 --> 11:36.294
in a mental institution.

11:36.296 --> 11:36.961
>> Right.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.029
>> This is weird.

11:38.031 --> 11:38.697
>> Whoa.

11:38.699 --> 11:39.664
And look what someone said.

11:39.666 --> 11:40.498
>> "I guess this thread

11:40.500 --> 11:43.234
is for telling lies."

11:43.236 --> 11:45.336
And then who liked that?

11:45.338 --> 11:48.206
>> Markie liked it.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.908
>> That's pretty weird.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.209
Look, here's another comment

11:51.211 --> 11:52.343
on this picture.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.511
Christopher [bleep].

11:53.513 --> 11:54.946
So here's a guy that seems

11:54.948 --> 11:56.347
to know her.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.183
See what his deal is.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.284
He went to Clovis too,

11:59.286 --> 12:00.018
and he's from Fresno.

12:00.020 --> 12:00.719
>> Yep, lives in Fresno.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.721
Let's send this guy a message.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.621
All right, let's just go back

12:03.623 --> 12:04.456
to where we were, because

12:04.458 --> 12:05.156
there was a lot going on

12:05.158 --> 12:06.424
at the beginning of December,

12:06.426 --> 12:08.893
including this, which is--

friends yesterday, and I haven't

26:54.847 --> 26:56.347
seen her since, so...

26:56.349 --> 26:58.115
>> Oh, as in, she hasn't been

26:58.117 --> 26:58.882
home since then?

26:58.884 --> 26:59.650
>> Right.

26:59.652 --> 27:00.684
>> Oh.

27:00.686 --> 27:03.554
>> Can I, like, walk away?

27:03.556 --> 27:05.689
I just feel so stupid.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.958
[scoffs] Gone again.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.759
>> Markie explained everything

27:08.761 --> 27:09.426
that was going on.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.160
>> She told you about it?

27:10.162 --> 27:10.761
>> Yes.

27:10.763 --> 27:11.562
>> She told you about Blaire,

27:11.564 --> 27:12.262
her friend in New York?

27:12.264 --> 27:12.796
>> Mm-hmm.

27:12.798 --> 27:13.464
>> Okay.

27:13.466 --> 27:14.231
>> Like, this just went to,

27:14.233 --> 27:14.999
like, I might give you a hug

27:15.001 --> 27:17.501
to now, like...

27:17.503 --> 27:18.636
>> If you speak to her...

27:18.638 --> 27:19.303
>> Mm-hmm.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.373
her know we stopped by.just let

27:22.375 --> 27:23.073
>> Okay.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.041
>> We're looking--we're waiting

27:24.043 --> 27:25.242
for her to let us know when

27:25.244 --> 27:26.477
and where to meet up with her.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.378
>> Okay.

27:27.380 --> 27:28.078
>> Thanks.

27:28.080 --> 27:28.746
>> No problem.

27:28.748 --> 27:29.413
>> Appreciate it.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.080
>> My pleasure.

27:30.082 --> 27:30.748
>> Take care.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.951
>> You guys be good.

27:36.087 --> 27:37.855
>> This is stupid.

27:37.857 --> 27:38.722
>> I mean, if you have to chase

27:38.724 --> 27:39.990
someone this much just to meet

27:39.992 --> 27:41.025
'em, then they might not be

the best of it.

28:55.935 --> 28:59.737
with the guys.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.538
Yeah, we've been looking for you

29:01.540 --> 29:02.239
all day.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.808
Where are you?

29:08.346 --> 29:09.079
Okay.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.215
>> We are at Wood--Woodford Park

29:11.217 --> 29:11.982
or something.

29:11.984 --> 29:12.649
>> Yeah, Woodward.

29:12.651 --> 29:15.919
Yeah.

29:15.921 --> 29:16.587
Great.

29:16.589 --> 29:20.791
See you soon.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.259
>> I mean, she could have

29:22.261 --> 29:23.894
said "sorry."

29:23.896 --> 29:24.661
>> Right, it would have been

29:24.663 --> 29:25.529
great if she had been

29:25.531 --> 29:26.864
considerate and texted.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.265
I'm just saying.

29:31.871 --> 29:32.536

It's not okay.

>> [sighs]

>> Yeah.

29:50.856 --> 29:51.622
>> All right.

29:51.624 --> 29:54.258
Well, she showed up.

29:56.728 --> 29:57.728
>> You okay?

29:57.730 --> 29:59.797
>> Yeah.

30:04.736 --> 30:05.536
>> Nice to meet you.

30:05.538 --> 30:06.703
>> Nice to meet you too.

>> Nev.

30:07.873 --> 30:08.539
>> Nice to meet you.

30:08.541 --> 30:09.439
Markie.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.974
>> Wow.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.509
>> Well, you're very excited.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.977
>> I'm very, very excited.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.078
I'm trying not to, like, jump

30:15.080 --> 30:16.146
into her arms and plow her down

30:16.148 --> 30:18.081
to the floor.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.917
>> It's not exactly the reaction

30:19.919 --> 30:21.618
that I expected.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.653
>> Yeah, if anything, we've been

30:22.655 --> 30:24.221
kind of ready for--

30:24.223 --> 30:25.522
>> The worst?

30:25.524 --> 30:26.590
>> I mean, look, we all want

30:26.592 --> 30:28.525
to be excited, obviously,

30:28.527 --> 30:30.060
but I just want to, like,

30:30.062 --> 30:31.061
get some things

30:31.063 --> 30:32.262
out of the way first.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.497
>> Of course.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.298
>> Do you guys want to go sit

30:34.300 --> 30:36.967
down at that table in the shade?

30:36.969 --> 30:38.569
>> So, okay, from what we

30:38.571 --> 30:40.003
gathered from Blaire's story

30:40.005 --> 30:41.238
was that you didn't come

30:41.240 --> 30:42.873
to New York, and then she got

30:42.875 --> 30:44.675
a strange phone call from you,

30:44.677 --> 30:47.044
like, a couple days afterwards

30:47.046 --> 30:47.711
saying that you were

30:47.713 --> 30:49.813
in a hospital of some kind

30:49.815 --> 30:51.582
and that you weren't gonna come

30:51.584 --> 30:52.482
and you were still in love

30:52.484 --> 30:53.617
with your ex-girlfriend

30:53.619 --> 30:56.220
and that it was over.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.154
>> I never got answers.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.155
I never got reasons,

30:58.157 --> 31:02.492
and that's all I want--is why.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.896
>> So I was 17, and...

31:09.534 --> 31:10.567
>> What?

31:10.569 --> 31:11.368
What?

31:11.370 --> 31:12.769
>> He persuaded me to go

31:12.771 --> 31:14.805
with him because of issues

31:14.807 --> 31:16.106
that would happen in New York

31:16.108 --> 31:17.908
that he saw.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.176
>> He saw issues?

31:19.178 --> 31:20.477
How could he--

31:20.479 --> 31:21.144
>> Who's "he"?

31:21.146 --> 31:21.879
>> I don't get this.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.347
>> Is he an ex of yours?

31:23.349 --> 31:24.181
>> No.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.215
>> So I don't know who she--just

31:25.217 --> 31:26.016
"he"?

31:26.018 --> 31:26.984
>> It's a very private

31:26.986 --> 31:28.252
situation.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.187
I can't really let out names.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.688
What had happened was I had

31:31.690 --> 31:32.990
a dream that I went to New York

31:32.992 --> 31:34.524
and I died.

31:34.526 --> 31:35.893
And I told him about the dream,

31:35.895 --> 31:37.794
and he told me that if I didn't

31:37.796 --> 31:40.030
go and repent my sins,

31:40.032 --> 31:41.365
I guess--I don't know.

31:41.367 --> 31:42.399
He didn't make it clear,

31:42.401 --> 31:45.369
but he told me pretty much

31:45.371 --> 31:46.236
if I didn't confess everything

31:46.238 --> 31:49.206
to him, I would die in New York.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.941
And so that pushed me

31:50.943 --> 31:53.844
to the limit as to where I felt

31:53.846 --> 31:55.812
like I needed to go...

31:55.814 --> 31:57.547
for you, for me, for my family,

31:57.549 --> 31:58.515
so I could stay alive.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.583
>> I mean, were you--were you,

31:59.585 --> 32:00.951
like, far away in the middle

32:00.953 --> 32:01.685
of nowhere?

32:01.687 --> 32:04.755
>> I was up in the mountains.

32:04.757 --> 32:05.522
>> Why does this person

32:05.524 --> 32:07.491
have so much influence over you?

32:07.493 --> 32:08.392
>> He was a close, personal

32:08.394 --> 32:09.259
friend.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.227
>> You don't think you could've

32:10.229 --> 32:12.296
told this guy you needed to let

32:12.298 --> 32:15.565
me know that you're not coming?

32:15.567 --> 32:16.600
>> No, because he didn't want

32:16.602 --> 32:17.301
to talk to you.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.068
He didn't want anything

32:18.070 --> 32:18.635
to do with you.

32:18.637 --> 32:19.736
>> You couldn't talk to me?

32:19.738 --> 32:21.204
>> I'm--

32:21.206 --> 32:22.406
It's a terrible story,

32:22.408 --> 32:23.874
and I'm sorry that I still

32:23.876 --> 32:25.375
don't--I don't--

32:25.377 --> 32:26.243
>> Fully understand?

32:26.245 --> 32:27.611
>> I don't understand it.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.312
>> I know this probably

32:28.314 --> 32:29.780
feels like an interrogation.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.315
I don't want it to.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.784
But does it come as a surprise

32:33.786 --> 32:35.786
that you have a reputation

32:35.788 --> 32:37.754
for not telling the truth?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.256
>> No, because I have had people

32:39.258 --> 32:40.757
in my past say that I have

32:40.759 --> 32:43.794
a lying problem.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.862
But I do try my best

32:45.864 --> 32:47.364
not to lie to Blaire.

32:47.366 --> 32:48.699
>> But you still do it.

32:48.701 --> 32:51.301
>> I try not to.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.769
>> But, of course, that also

32:52.771 --> 32:54.805
means that it's hard now for us

32:54.807 --> 32:57.541
to know what is and isn't true.

32:57.543 --> 32:58.976
But, I mean, are there things

32:58.978 --> 33:00.077
that you either haven't been

33:00.079 --> 33:00.944
honest about or just haven't

33:00.946 --> 33:01.712
told her?

33:01.714 --> 33:03.146
'Cause right now Blaire needs

33:03.148 --> 33:04.681
to figure out her life,

33:04.683 --> 33:05.582
and the only way she can know

33:05.584 --> 33:07.951
that is to get something close

33:07.953 --> 33:10.287
to the real you.

33:13.191 --> 33:14.725
>> Hey, I'm Markie.

33:14.727 --> 33:15.392
>> I'm Blaire.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.627
>> I'm a psychotic crazy person.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.830
I have a semi-lying problem,

33:19.832 --> 33:20.864
and I'm absolutely in love

33:20.866 --> 33:23.533
with you.

33:23.535 --> 33:24.201
I want to be a part

33:24.203 --> 33:25.602
of your life.

33:25.604 --> 33:26.903
I want to be there for you.

33:26.905 --> 33:27.637
I want to be the person

33:27.639 --> 33:30.240
you can cry on.

33:30.242 --> 33:30.907
I want to be the girl

33:30.909 --> 33:31.575
you come home to,

33:31.577 --> 33:32.309
and I want to be the girl

33:32.311 --> 33:35.579
wearing your ring.

33:35.581 --> 33:40.550
>> I'm gonna interrupt.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.353
I feel like...

33:43.355 --> 33:48.025
you're unbelievably smooth.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.127
A week ago, you told her not

33:50.129 --> 33:51.128
to keep dating the girl

33:51.130 --> 33:52.763
she's dating because you didn't

33:52.765 --> 33:53.797
want her to.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.465
You know exactly what to say.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.400
It feels like I'm listening

33:56.402 --> 33:57.801
to a script for, like,

33:57.803 --> 33:58.769
the perfect scene out of

33:58.771 --> 34:00.170
the perfect movie

34:00.172 --> 34:02.039
from the perfect guy who says

34:02.041 --> 34:03.073
exactly the right thing

34:03.075 --> 34:04.341
to the girl, and they walk off

34:04.343 --> 34:05.876
happily into the sunset.

34:05.878 --> 34:08.445
That's not how this is gonna go,

34:08.447 --> 34:09.646
because that's the worst thing

34:09.648 --> 34:11.248
you can do for her.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.282
The worst thing you can do

34:12.284 --> 34:13.884
for her right now is that.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.685
If you care about someone,

34:15.687 --> 34:19.089
be real with them.

34:19.091 --> 34:19.889
>> And if she doesn't want

34:19.891 --> 34:20.791
to be with me, she doesn't have

34:20.793 --> 34:21.324
to be with me.

34:21.326 --> 34:22.159
>> She does want to be with you.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.393
That's the problem.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.261
Because she's not good

34:24.263 --> 34:25.328
at recognizing things

34:25.330 --> 34:27.197
that are bad for her.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.197
So I'm trying to help her

34:28.199 --> 34:29.699
do that.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.568
Now, I know you were incredibly

34:31.570 --> 34:33.303
supportive for a period of time

34:33.304 --> 34:34.905
that was tremendously important

34:34.907 --> 34:35.572
for her.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.273
So I am sure you have

34:36.275 --> 34:37.274
a genuine connection as a

34:37.275 --> 34:38.641
result of that.

34:38.643 --> 34:39.443
But I just think you need

34:39.445 --> 34:42.646
to be much more careful

34:42.648 --> 34:44.347
with the words you choose.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.748
It's really dangerous to say

34:45.751 --> 34:46.882
"I love you" to someone.

34:46.885 --> 34:47.717
"I want to spend my life

34:47.719 --> 34:49.152
with you, even though we just

34:49.154 --> 34:51.054
met ten minutes ago," and not

34:51.056 --> 34:53.924
have them go into a tailspin.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.292
You're just lying without

34:55.293 --> 34:56.493
intentionally doing it

34:56.495 --> 34:58.295
and giving the wrong signals

34:58.297 --> 34:59.362
to the wrong person

34:59.364 --> 35:02.799
and just hurting both of you.

35:02.801 --> 35:03.934
This is the opportunity

35:03.936 --> 35:06.236
to finally clear things up,

35:06.238 --> 35:08.305
not complicate them more.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.739
Anyway, I'm--I'm sorry.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.541
I'm just trying to help.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.010

35:22.254 --> 35:23.487

35:23.489 --> 35:26.056

35:38.603 --> 35:41.671

35:41.673 --> 35:42.639
If I didn't care about you,

35:42.641 --> 35:45.408
why would I be sitting here?

35:45.410 --> 35:47.310
>> I don't know.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.347
You know the spot I was at,

35:50.349 --> 35:54.050
and then for you to just

35:54.052 --> 35:55.085
basically fall off the face

35:55.087 --> 35:58.421
of the Earth, like, why?

35:58.423 --> 36:00.457
You were all I had at that time.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.325
You were the only one I had.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.059
All you had to do was say,

36:03.061 --> 36:04.294
"I'm scared."

36:04.296 --> 36:05.095
And you know that's why

36:05.097 --> 36:07.497
you didn't come...

36:07.499 --> 36:08.698
'cause you were scared.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.033
That's why you got--

36:10.035 --> 36:11.535
whatever happened.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.302
>> I was scared.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.637
You're right, but that doesn't

36:13.639 --> 36:14.538
mean I wasn't gonna bail out on

36:14.540 --> 36:15.705
you.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.407
>> You kind of did, though,

36:17.409 --> 36:18.742
if you think about it.

36:18.744 --> 36:19.809
So, yeah, you did bail out on

36:19.811 --> 36:21.811
me.

36:21.813 --> 36:25.482
I spent my last penny to get you

36:25.484 --> 36:27.150
to New York...

36:27.152 --> 36:29.986
'cause you were what I had.

The simple two words,

36:31.990 --> 36:34.057
"I'm scared."

36:37.128 --> 36:37.894
>> I don't really want

36:37.896 --> 36:39.229
you to leave.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.030
I don't want you to leave

36:40.032 --> 36:40.597
at all.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.765
>> Then be honest.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.533
Be honest with me.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.036
You're such a smart person.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.038
You have so much to offer

36:48.040 --> 36:50.440
the world, but if you would cut

36:50.442 --> 36:51.575
the lies out, I think a lot

36:51.577 --> 36:53.510
more people would see that.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.211
Like, I don't know.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.513
I'm angry, and I'm hurt,

36:56.515 --> 36:57.514

37:09.528 --> 37:11.228
How?

37:11.230 --> 37:13.396
I was crazy about you.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.432
So why [bleep] that up?

37:15.434 --> 37:18.201
I mean, if you feel so strongly

37:18.203 --> 37:20.270
about me, why do it?

37:20.272 --> 37:21.204
>> I do want to be a part

37:21.206 --> 37:22.739
of your life.

37:22.741 --> 37:23.840
I do, and I've told you

37:23.842 --> 37:26.376
that multiple times.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.481
>> I need stability in my life.

37:31.483 --> 37:32.649
I cannot have someone

37:32.651 --> 37:33.783
that's gonna be here one day

37:33.785 --> 37:35.518

37:35.520 --> 37:39.456
I can't deal with liars anymore.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.492
So, if you want to be a part of

37:42.494 --> 37:45.228
my life, the lies need to stop.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.663
Every word out of your mouth

37:46.665 --> 37:47.931
has to be truthful.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.399

37:51.370 --> 37:52.135

37:52.137 --> 37:53.703

37:53.705 --> 37:54.704
to lose someone that has

37:54.706 --> 37:58.074
brought me out of a hole.
