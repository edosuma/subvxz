00:00.834 --> 00:03.936
Woman:
Does that tickle?
Woman 2: Oh, yeah. Oh-ho-ho...

00:03.938 --> 00:07.006
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
(moaning): Oh... Oh, my god.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.708
Oh...
Oh, my god, jenny!
Oh, my god.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.143
Yeah. Oh...
Oh, my god.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.712
Oh, my <i>god.</i>

00:13.714 --> 00:15.948
Oh, jenny!
Give it to me.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.516
Give it to me,
jenny.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.551
Just give it to her
already.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.988
(women continue
exclaiming, moaning)

00:25.558 --> 00:26.425
Hey.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.127
Hey. Couldn't sleep, either?

00:28.129 --> 00:31.230
No. Jenny and her friend
are crazy in there.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.966
Have you ever made
a woman scream like that?

00:33.968 --> 00:35.034
Once.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.902
I hit her with my car.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.537
It sounded like jenny hit her

00:38.539 --> 00:41.840
And then backed over her again.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.542
And then hit her,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.711
A-and then...
Backed over her again.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.181
And then hit her...

00:49.183 --> 00:51.083
And then backed over her again.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.353
I counted eight orgasms,
not including mine.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.754
Hey, that's my niece.
Oh, yeah,

00:55.756 --> 00:58.657
And out of respect to you,
I only listened to her friend.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.659
Yeah, me, too.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.096
Hey, how about
this weekend <i>we</i> go out

01:04.098 --> 01:06.098
And find some women
and make 'em scream?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.967
In-in your imagination,

01:08.969 --> 01:12.171
Are they running away from you
or towards you?

01:12.173 --> 01:13.806
You know what I mean.

01:13.808 --> 01:15.941
Let's go out
and find some <i>strange.</i>

01:15.943 --> 01:19.111
I'm looking at some <i>strange.</i>

01:19.113 --> 01:21.080
Besides, I can't.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.915
My mom's got a charity dinner
this weekend.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.783
Oh, she's still trying
to help the monkeys?

01:24.785 --> 01:28.053
Yeah, she's raising money
to expand her sanctuary

01:28.055 --> 01:31.123
For helpless creatures
that nobody else wants.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.925
Kind of like what I do for you.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.394
Will there be any
single ladies there

01:35.396 --> 01:37.296
Looking to use those
opposable thumbs?

01:37.298 --> 01:40.065
You know, swing on my vine,
peel my banana.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.834
Well, there might be a few there

01:41.836 --> 01:43.936
That want to throw
their poop at you.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.538
Mm, sounds like a good cause;
I'll buy a ticket.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.475
They're a thousand
dollars apiece.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.711
Can I borrow $998?

01:52.713 --> 01:53.979
Hey.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.681
Hey.
Hey.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.319
(whirring)

02:00.321 --> 02:01.720
That'll work.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.189
You know what they say:

02:04.191 --> 02:08.060
Once you go
black & decker,
you never go back.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.829
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

02:10.831 --> 02:13.098
♪ ah.
♪ men.
♪ men.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.975
Hey! Look at you.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.910
Where are you going
in that monkey suit?

02:24.912 --> 02:26.612
A benefit.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.514
For monkeys.

02:29.949 --> 02:31.617
How do I look?

02:31.619 --> 02:33.852
Like you should be
on top of a cake.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.754
Let me guess: You're the cake.

02:35.756 --> 02:40.292
No, I'm the one that gets
to blow out the candle.

02:43.062 --> 02:46.365
Oh, when did we install
a mirror in here?

02:46.367 --> 02:47.900
(chuckles)
tell the truth, berta,

02:47.902 --> 02:49.635
You ever seen
two better-looking guys?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.036
No.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.371
Yes.

02:53.806 --> 02:56.909
(doorbell rings)
oh. That must be my date.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.213
Hi, honey.
(laughs) you
look amazing.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.882
Oh, you look so handsome.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.384
Wow, nice job, walden.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.852
Where'd you two meet?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.921
Kind of a "meet cute."

03:08.923 --> 03:10.689
I shot out of her.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.491
Jenny, this is
my mom, robin.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.093
Mom, this is my new
roommate, jenny.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.828
Oh, well, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.463
(gasps)
alan,

03:18.465 --> 03:19.965
Does this mean
you finally moved out?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.800
(hearty laughter)

03:23.136 --> 03:24.703
No, no, no,
jenny's my niece.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.071
She's staying
in jake's room.

03:26.073 --> 03:29.208
Well, I have my charity,
you have yours.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.778
I can see where walden
gets his pretty face.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.079
Aren't you sweet?

03:34.081 --> 03:35.347
He's single, you know.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.482
I know. Are you?

03:39.118 --> 03:41.086
Okay. All right, let's...

03:41.088 --> 03:44.156
Go save some monkeys.

03:44.158 --> 03:45.824
(clears throat softly)

03:45.826 --> 03:47.259
Really?

03:47.261 --> 03:48.827
Hey, just 'cause
you came out of it

03:48.829 --> 03:51.296
Doesn't mean
I don't want to get into it.

03:55.368 --> 03:58.036
(scoffs) they call
these martinis?

03:58.038 --> 04:00.939
The only thing they're saving
the monkeys from are dui's.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.341
(laughing)

04:02.343 --> 04:03.775
You like that one?

04:03.777 --> 04:07.946
No, I was just picturing
a drunk monkey driving a car.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.049
Walden.
Mm.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.384
Oh.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.920
That woman with your mom
looks just like lynda carter.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.389
(alan laughs)

04:17.391 --> 04:18.690
That is lynda carter.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.925
Really?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.893
Wait, wait, t-tv's
wonder woman?

04:21.895 --> 04:23.528
The jewel of
paradise island?

04:23.530 --> 04:26.932
The-the shining crusader
for justice and star-
spangled hot pants?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.268
I-I just call her lynda.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.604
And I just lost the cleaning
deposit on this tux.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.805
Walden.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.741
Lynda, you look amazing.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.410
Oh, my god.
The last time we saw each other,

04:38.412 --> 04:40.078
You barely came up to here.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.648
I remember those... Days.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.717
(clearing throat):
Introduce me.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.953
Robin, you told me
he was successful,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.489
But you didn't tell me
how gorgeous he is.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.924
Well, it takes
a gorgeous person
to know one.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.226
(laughs)

04:54.228 --> 04:56.561
(nervous laughing):
No, it doesn't. I'm alan.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.497
Hi.

04:58.499 --> 05:02.167
This is alan harper.
He lives with walden.
Oh, well, it's lovely

05:02.169 --> 05:03.335
To meet you.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.238
My gay fans have always been
my biggest supporters.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.573
Oh, oh, no, no, I-I'm not gay.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.109
Oh, I'm sorry.
Transgender?

05:12.111 --> 05:14.046
I told you the hormones
weren't working.

05:14.048 --> 05:15.213
(chuckles)

05:15.215 --> 05:17.382
He's kidding.
Uh, I-I am very straight.

05:17.384 --> 05:20.686
In fact, the longer I look
at you the straighter I become.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.655
Well, if you'll excuse us,
I'm gonna start a fund

05:23.657 --> 05:26.491
To, um, save lynda
from this conversation.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.694
(giggles)
it's lovely to meet you.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.997
And it was "wonder-ful"
meeting you. (chuckles)

05:31.999 --> 05:34.733
That's funny. I've never
heard <i>that</i> one before.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.301
Don't be a stranger.
Okay.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.804
Call me.
(chuckles)

05:41.441 --> 05:44.443
What the hell are you doing?

05:44.445 --> 05:48.080
Sorry, I just wanted to put
my mouth where her mouth was.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.382
And I also wanted to thank
you for a lovely evening.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.455
Morning.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.156
Mm. I got to tell you,

05:58.158 --> 06:00.859
You gave me a night
that I will never forget.

06:02.795 --> 06:05.697
Don't ever say that to me again.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.965
I'm serious.
Meeting lynda carter was

06:06.967 --> 06:08.700
One of the greatest moments
of my life.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.402
I mean, she was
my first celebrity crush.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.404
I had a poster of her
that looked like

06:12.406 --> 06:15.207
The bottom of a birdcage.

06:15.209 --> 06:19.511
On behalf of lynda carter
and the rest of humanity...

06:19.513 --> 06:21.346
Yuck.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.882
You know, it's not just about
how beautiful she was.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.385
I mean, she's multitalented.
I mean, I had all of her albums,

06:26.387 --> 06:28.553
I-I-I've seen everything
she's ever done.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.988
How?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.491
Were you hiding outside
her house in a bush?

06:32.493 --> 06:34.593
(snorting laugh)

06:36.195 --> 06:39.197
Lynda carter's bush.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.301
Hey, you know, she's single.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.503
And?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.238
And? (laughs)

06:46.240 --> 06:48.140
Set me up with her.

06:48.142 --> 06:51.410
Can't I just... Get
you a new poster?

06:52.879 --> 06:54.880
I'll laminate it.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.048
Come on, come on.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.518
I-I-I have been in love with
lynda carter for my whole life,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.287
And because you know her
and I know you,

07:02.289 --> 07:04.022
I actually have a shot.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.490
I mean, this is fate.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.225
This is probably
why my brother died.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.661
You said fate
killed your brother

07:09.663 --> 07:11.763
So you could get
that espresso machine.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.465
Come on!

07:13.467 --> 07:15.100
I'll see what I can do.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.234
Really?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.936
Yeah. Just don't
get your hopes up.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.371

Oh, of course not.

(jenny clears throat)

09:40.180 --> 09:41.513
Hey.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.281
Hey. You're up early.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.084
(sighs):
Yup. Crack of dawn.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.720
But, shh,
dawn is still sleeping.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.556
Good morning.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.657
Good morning.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.659
Uh, hey, jenny,
do you have any idea

09:54.661 --> 09:57.762
How to get tear stains
out of pillows?

09:57.764 --> 10:00.065
It's certainly not more tears,
because I tried that.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.399
Have you tried spraying

10:01.401 --> 10:03.435
Some desperate
cry for attention on it?

10:05.571 --> 10:07.072
You want
some coffee?

10:07.074 --> 10:09.274
Why, yes, I would.
Oh, uh, walden,

10:09.276 --> 10:10.976
Is there some
uglier coffee

10:10.978 --> 10:12.811
That might be more
appropriate for me?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.913
All right.
Alan, you're being ridiculous.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.681
Hey, sticks and stones
may break my bones,

10:16.683 --> 10:19.084
But thanks to you,
I'll never bone lynda carter.

10:20.820 --> 10:24.389
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
will breakfast alone in my room.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.825
What's wrong with auntie alan?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.894
She's pouting 'cause I won't
set her up with lynda carter.

10:29.896 --> 10:33.131
Why not?
Because, it's lynda carter.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.933
Right.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.135
And who's lynda carter?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.404
Lynda carter is an actress.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.140
Oh. And she makes you
say her whole name?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.642
She doesn't make you,

10:43.644 --> 10:46.277
It's just something you do
when people reach icon status.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.780
So why won't you
set alan up with her?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.281
She's out of his league.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.583
What league is she in?

10:51.585 --> 10:54.819
Well, among others,
the justice league.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.489
All right, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

10:57.491 --> 10:59.691
So let me just
ask you a question.

10:59.693 --> 11:03.061
Is alan good enough
to be your friend?
Of course.

11:03.063 --> 11:06.164
So then why isn't he
good enough for her?
Okay, that's not fair.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.000
There are a lot of women that
alan is not good enough for.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.604
Don't you think she should
decide who she can go out with?

11:12.606 --> 11:15.507
Hmm. That's actually
a good point.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.109
Hang on, one second,
is this lynda carter?
Uh-huh.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.212
Yeah, alan's not
good enough for her.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.317
(sighs)

11:26.319 --> 11:27.519
Alan.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.787
Alan: Yeah?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.588
Are you decent?

11:30.590 --> 11:33.558
Not by your standards.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.094
Okay, I'm coming in.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.929
What do you want?

11:37.931 --> 11:40.732
If it's self-esteem you're
after, there's none here.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.801
I was wrong.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.371
It is not my place to decide
who you can or cannot date.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.372
No, no, it's fine.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.840
Uh, actually, I'm making a list

11:48.842 --> 11:50.341
Of the people
you shouldn't date.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.778
Uh, number one:
Anyone with a heart.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.814
Okay, you know, I deserve that.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.283
And number two,
taylor swift, because she will

11:58.285 --> 12:01.953
Write a song about you called
"back-stabbing dream killer."

12:01.955 --> 12:03.855
Okay, well, if you will let me,

12:03.857 --> 12:06.391
I would like
to make it up to you.

12:06.393 --> 12:11.129
I invited my mother and lynda
over for dinner tomorrow night.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.165
So, you are free
to ask her out yourself.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.568
If you're joking,
I swear to god

12:16.570 --> 12:19.504
I will pack my things and you
will never see me again.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.972
I was joking.
So was I.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.708
You're not just doing this
out of pity, are you?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.677
Don't answer, I don't care.

12:25.679 --> 12:26.711
You're a good friend.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.546
So are you.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.849
And, again, I'm sorry.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.517
Thank you.

12:32.519 --> 12:36.020
Okay. Oh, and,
and, a little tip:

12:36.022 --> 12:39.758
When lynda's here, just try
not to act like a crazy fan.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.161
(chuckles) I got it.
No, no, seriously, like, if,
if you want a shot with her

12:43.163 --> 12:45.396
You need to treat
her like she's
a normal person.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.999
And, and you should
pretend to be one, yourself.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.634
It's not a problem.
(laughs)

12:53.272 --> 12:56.474
Until tomorrow.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.246
All right,
I'm out of here.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.015
Dinner's in the oven
and the wine's chilling.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.016
Oh, thank you.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.918
No, I was talking about
at my house.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.155
Oh, oh, uh, uh,
before you go, um,

13:10.157 --> 13:12.457
Uh, uh, which is my good side?
What?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.526
I'm trying to figure out
where to sit at dinner.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.461
I-I want my good side
facing lynda.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.996
All right.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.597
Turn to your left.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.698
Okay.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.933
Now turn to your right.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.701
Okay.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.037
Turn around.

13:26.039 --> 13:29.874
Perfect.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.043
Who hurt you, berta?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.578
(doorbell rings)

13:33.580 --> 13:35.013
Oh, uh...

13:38.150 --> 13:40.518
Ooh, uh, just in case.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.623
Oh, god, it burns!

13:48.027 --> 13:50.895
What did I say about
acting like a normal person?

13:50.897 --> 13:54.966
That was before I got mint spray
in little alan's eye.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.035
I'm not even gonna ask.

13:58.637 --> 14:01.206
Oh, hey, you two
look beautiful.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.575
Oh, it's great
to see you again, walden.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.176
And don't forget about me.
(chuckles)

14:05.178 --> 14:08.613
Oh, don't worry, I haven't.

14:08.615 --> 14:12.150
Okay, you can let go now.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.185
Well, I'm glad
you two could make it.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.155
Wow, this is quite the place.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.257
Both:
Thank you.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.059
Single guy living at the beach,

14:21.061 --> 14:23.094
You must do well
with the ladies.

14:23.096 --> 14:27.432
I do okay, but this guy
is the real charmer.

14:27.434 --> 14:32.337
Blink twice if you're
being held against your will.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.771
Well, it's,
it's true, in my youth

14:33.773 --> 14:35.940
I was a bit of a,
a rapscallion.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.275
(nervous chuckle)

14:37.277 --> 14:38.509
A rake.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.578
A... Gadabout.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.014
Walden:
A... G-gadabout?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.916
What have you.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.719
Yeah, but that was
in your past, right?

14:47.721 --> 14:50.788
And now you're just a
normal, regular guy?

14:50.790 --> 14:51.923
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.

14:51.925 --> 14:55.126
I'm just a,
a normal, regular guy

14:55.128 --> 14:58.863
Looking for a crazy
little thing called love.

14:58.865 --> 15:02.300
Lynda carter:
♪ crazy little thing
called love... ♪

15:02.302 --> 15:05.470
What's that I hear?

15:05.472 --> 15:09.674
Is that the lovely voice of
triple-threat lynda carter?

15:09.676 --> 15:13.044
Actress, singer, dancer?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.880
Wait a second,
do I smell mint?

15:19.051 --> 15:22.553
Yes, and it's not
coming from my mouth.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.761
Oh ,uh, uh,
would you mind signing it

15:29.763 --> 15:32.730
"from a wonder woman
to a super man"?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.902
How about "best wishes"?
That works. (chuckles)

15:37.904 --> 15:39.537
Hey, you know,
I'll, I'll bet you could

15:39.539 --> 15:40.972
Make a lot of money
traveling around

15:40.974 --> 15:42.373
And signing
at conventions and stuff.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.409
I'm not a big fan of travel.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.744
Yeah, not to mention
the weirdos you'd meet.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.980
Ugh. You don't
have to tell me,

15:48.982 --> 15:51.115
I mean, I-I've talked
to a lot of them

15:51.117 --> 15:54.752
On the wonder woman
message boards. Freaks!

15:56.055 --> 15:57.655
Alan?
Hmm?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.624
I'm pretty sure lynda didn't
come here just to sign things.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.726
Oh, of course, of course.
Sorry, I just, you know,

16:01.728 --> 16:03.928
I, I geeked out a bit.
(chuckles)

16:03.930 --> 16:05.930
Oh, that's okay.
You can't imagine how often

16:05.932 --> 16:08.700
I get roped into these kinds
of conversations.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.601
Roped? Or...

16:10.603 --> 16:12.136
...Lassoed?

16:13.605 --> 16:16.774
Oh, god. He's gonna tie her up
and throw her in a van.

16:16.776 --> 16:20.178
No, no. This is an original
wonder woman lasso of truth.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.613
I-I got it at comic con '88.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.882
Yeah, back when only
the really cool people went.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.321
Whoever is wearing the lasso
must tell the truth.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.357
(giggles) is this
the best night of my life?

16:32.359 --> 16:33.825
It is.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.762
Are you completely oblivious
to social cues?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.530
You are.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.000
Oh, oh, would you mind
posing with it

16:42.002 --> 16:43.434
So I can snap a quick picture?

16:44.603 --> 16:46.471
Alan. (whispers): Enough.
Mm-hmm?

16:46.473 --> 16:50.174
No. It, it's okay.
Let's just take the picture.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.077
Oh great, great. Oh,
crud. The memory's full.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.879
Uh, uh, let me just
delete a few.

16:54.881 --> 16:58.116
Good-bye, jake.
Good-bye, jake.

Oh, kitty, hang in there.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.853
Good-bye, jake.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.155
Okay, would you like to...
Yes!

17:07.092 --> 17:09.394
Hurry back.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.595
It's going well, isn't it?

17:10.597 --> 17:12.597
I have chimps smarter than you.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.801
I'm really sorry
about tonight.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.803
Oh, it's okay.
He's harmless.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.039
He   <i>i</i>harmless, right?

17:21.041 --> 17:24.242
Yeah, he's harmless,
clueless, homeless.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.643
He's pretty much "less."

17:25.645 --> 17:28.546
(laughs) still,
I'm glad I came over.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.148
It's really good
to see you again.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.550
Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.
And you look amazing.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.253
Or, should I say,
"wonder-ful."

17:35.255 --> 17:38.589
See? When you do it,
it's cute.
(chuckles)

17:38.591 --> 17:40.391

17:44.731 --> 17:46.297
Nice to meet you.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.999
Jenny is

17:48.001 --> 17:50.568
Ah, well, I won't
hold that against you.

Beautiful <i>and</i> funny.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.806

aren't you sweet.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.375
Oh, I can be way sweeter.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.210
Or less, if that's
what you're into.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.845
Hmm.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.413
You still like
wearing cuffs?

18:02.415 --> 18:07.085
Okay. All right, uh, jenny,
isn't your bedroom that way?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.720

18:11.323 --> 18:15.326
See? I told you the
gays really like me.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.729
I'm sorry. I, I,
I actually, I do have to ask:

18:18.731 --> 18:21.165
Does alan have
a shot with you?

18:21.167 --> 18:22.733
<i>That</i> alan?

You do know I'm lynda
freakin' carter, right?

18:25.705 --> 18:29.407
Okay. Asked
and answered.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.510
It seems that everyone
in this house
wants to be with me

18:32.512 --> 18:34.445
Except the one
that I want.
(chuckles) yeah.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.581
Wait, what?

18:37.316 --> 18:39.884

Oh, really?

Oh, I'll tell you
what's going on.

never intentionally
try to hurt me.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.976
We're past it.
