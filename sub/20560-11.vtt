[upbeat electronic music playing]

02:29.149 --> 02:32.527
-Hey, everyone.
-[cheering, applause]

02:35.947 --> 02:38.825
I don't want to spoil the night
with some boring speech

02:38.908 --> 02:41.161
about the incredible year we've had,

02:41.661 --> 02:43.955
capped with J-Bak Investments

02:44.038 --> 02:48.084
cracking the top five
global finance companies.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.670
-[cheering]
-Yep. Yep.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.340
Well, my guess is
you're all here 'cause...

02:55.592 --> 02:58.428
you know we're taking good care
of your money.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.555
[cheering]

03:00.638 --> 03:01.764
How about that?

03:08.104 --> 03:09.439
I'll be honest with you.

03:11.232 --> 03:14.611
After what happened to me
and to my family...

03:15.570 --> 03:17.280
it would've been easy to give up.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.867
I thought about it a lot.

03:21.451 --> 03:25.580
I read the articles,
both fact and fiction.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.956
I won't lie.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.626
It hurt.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.962
Especially the stuff about my sister.

03:33.963 --> 03:40.136
I admit, I wanted to run away and...
let everyone forget the name Bak.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.390
But then...

03:48.102 --> 03:49.520
I think about him.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.441
My dad.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.903
He used to give these speeches.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.406
He was so good.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.327
Uh, you remember the '08 speech, Tae?

04:05.578 --> 04:09.624
He made you feel like the crisis
was the best thing that ever happened.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.376
[laughter]

04:12.085 --> 04:15.255
My dad inspired confidence.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.051
You believed him. You trusted him.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.721
You knew you were a part of this family...

04:26.599 --> 04:30.687
and that he'd do whatever he could
to take care of you.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.858
That's what Bak meant to people.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.779
And that's why I'm back.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.907
[cheering, applause]

04:46.661 --> 04:49.455
Because I want it to mean that again.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.708
Believe in me.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.294
Trust me.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.756
And I promise...

05:02.468 --> 05:04.095
I will take care of you.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.890
[applause, cheering]

05:08.975 --> 05:10.059
Enjoy yourselves.

[cheering]

05:13.980 --> 05:16.941
[electronic music playing]

05:19.777 --> 05:20.611
I would.

05:25.908 --> 05:26.743
Wait.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.329
Let's think about this.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.125
I thought the plan
was to get him to confess.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.418
Plan's changed.

05:38.004 --> 05:38.838
Wait.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.509
[Capheus] It's Detective Mun.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.596
Hey, make sure you cover the exit, okay?

05:46.679 --> 05:48.598
-[man] Okay.
-Excuse me, coming through.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.476
-Mun did it.
-He's going to arrest him.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.728
Sometimes the law gets it right.

05:53.811 --> 05:56.606
I always had a good feeling
about this guy.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.484
[Mun] Mr. Bak.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.487
Mr. Bak?

06:05.907 --> 06:07.408
You see these men here?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.952
They're with the Securities
and Fraud division.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.622
And this is your warrant.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.001
Just come with us peacefully,
or I will cuff you

06:17.085 --> 06:19.170
in front of all these people,

06:19.253 --> 06:20.963
including those reporters, okay?

06:23.174 --> 06:26.469
That won't be necessary, Detective.
I'll come with you.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.679
Cool. Let's go.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.682
[crowd screaming]

06:32.350 --> 06:34.018
Help! There's my sister!

06:37.605 --> 06:39.732
[groaning]

06:39.816 --> 06:41.067
[Riley] He shot him.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.485
[Capheus] He killed Mun.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.032
-What do we do now?
-We get that motherfucker.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.214
It's her! It really is her!

07:03.297 --> 07:04.549
Kill her!

07:04.632 --> 07:06.050
[crowd screaming]

07:47.633 --> 07:48.593
Where is he going?

07:48.676 --> 07:50.052
Heading for the garage.

07:50.761 --> 07:51.971
His car's being brought up.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.974
There's an exit to the garage that way.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.255
These guys are professionals.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.216
They'll spread out.
They'll come at us from multiple angles.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.550
[Wolfgang] We get the beady one first.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.427
-Why?
-He didn't look at his weapon.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.137
The dangerous ones never check.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.430
Uh, I have an idea.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.058
Distract the big one,
go over that car for a clean shot.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.435
I'd go left. Draw out the big one,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.187
use the truck, straight for the beady one.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.939
I said I have an idea.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.367
What are you doing?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.336
That was your idea?
To let them know we're here?

09:05.419 --> 09:06.629
No. The tank.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.967
Cars don't blow up like they do on TV.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.134
I know.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.638
[stammers] Wait.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.056
Do you mind? I...

09:37.243 --> 09:40.329
The slope of the garage
was gonna bring the gas right here.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.583
Okay. That was hot.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.939
Oh, shit.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.446
Not that easy.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.824
The curtain falls.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.036
[tires screeching]

10:27.627 --> 10:28.502
Fuck.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.503
Oh, shit.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.049
This is Joong-Ki Bak.
Open the fucking gate right now!

10:33.132 --> 10:37.011
[Nomi] Love to, J-Bak. But first,
I need you to do something for me.

10:39.055 --> 10:39.889
What?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.308
Confess to framing your sister
and murdering your father,

10:42.391 --> 10:43.726
and you'll be free to go.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.857
Who... who the hell is this?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.067
Who are we?

10:52.985 --> 10:54.403
Justice, motherfucker.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.489
-And we're...
-...coming for you.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.994
That's from The Root of All Evil.
I love that movie.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.705
Thank you, Bug.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.834
Maybe not my best film,
but some good lines in it.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.762
Shit.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.977
Shit.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.962
Help me.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.297
I got you.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.512
-We need eyes on this.
-Working on it.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.898
[Nomi] We're inside the grid now.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.401
We have him stopped
at a red light up ahead.

12:20.739 --> 12:21.866
Whoo!

12:30.916 --> 12:32.293
Are you serious?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.670
My sister is the fucking Terminator?

12:39.633 --> 12:40.760
Fuck.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.219
[horn blaring]

13:18.214 --> 13:20.007
-[horn honking]
-Fuck!

13:23.469 --> 13:24.720
Fuck!

13:34.396 --> 13:36.148
Leave me alone!

13:41.904 --> 13:43.739
There has to be a major police response.

13:44.949 --> 13:45.824
It's big.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.909
[Amanita] It's getting bigger.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.661
Cops are shutting down the area.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.995
Oh, it's a road block.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.207
Oh, shit.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.419
-Shit!
-[tires screeching]

14:10.933 --> 14:12.643
-Out of my way!
-[car horn honking]

14:24.154 --> 14:26.031
[mutters] Come on!

14:28.909 --> 14:30.744
How do we stop this guy?

14:31.495 --> 14:32.580
We need a weapon.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.517
Oh, shit!

16:18.686 --> 16:19.728
[Joong-Ki] Sun.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.732
[sobbing] Please, save me. Please, Sun.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.242
My company...

16:34.034 --> 16:38.122
even my reputation...
is meaningless without my daughter.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.588
You... killed him.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.341
He was going to tell the truth
to the court.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.679
You murdered our father.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.392
I was nowhere near him.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.647
I know why you did it. You will pay.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.315
I swear it!

17:10.946 --> 17:12.114
Who am I?

17:22.541 --> 17:23.792
I have an enemy.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.796
And I won't stop until he's dead.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.050
Or I am.

17:32.259 --> 17:36.221
He wanted you to know that
he has never been the forgiving type.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.988
You have a heart as soft as a baby bird.

17:57.701 --> 17:58.827
[mother] Please, Sun.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.871
Take care of your brother.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.750
Do this for me.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.757
Who... am... I?

18:26.355 --> 18:29.024
Please, I beg you. Please, stop.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.240
I'll confess.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.285
I'll tell them whatever you want.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.787
[sirens wailing]

18:45.290 --> 18:47.835
[whimpering] Please, Sun. Sun, please.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.130
You're not a killer. You're not like me.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.801
I'm your brother.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.180
You were my brother.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.150
Did you all see what I saw?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.485
[all] We did.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.487
Who was that guy?

20:39.154 --> 20:40.906
Tae Park. Politician.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.324
Figures.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.245
What are we going to do?

20:46.328 --> 20:48.080
If she goes back to prison...

20:48.163 --> 20:49.164
...they'll kill her.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.422
No one's going to prison.

21:19.653 --> 21:20.737
What do we need?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.240
You have access to the traffic systems?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.951
I told you,
I'm an all-access kind of girl.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.203
-Street map.
-[Amanita] Got it.

21:30.956 --> 21:31.873
What else do we need?

21:31.957 --> 21:34.042
-A big-ass...
-...intersection.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.636
Big-ass intersection coming up.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.263
-Bug?
-Almost in.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.686
Are you sure about this?

21:53.729 --> 21:55.397
These wagons are built like safes.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.692
You'll be all right.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.739
-The switch is ready?
-I'm in.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.326
Ten...

22:10.620 --> 22:11.455
eight...

22:16.126 --> 22:17.127
four,

22:17.210 --> 22:18.754
three,

22:18.837 --> 22:20.422
two, one!

22:22.382 --> 22:23.884
[horn blaring]

22:23.967 --> 22:25.427
Hold on!

22:25.510 --> 22:26.803
[horn blaring]

22:26.887 --> 22:28.430
[all shouting]

22:48.575 --> 22:50.660
[siren wailing]

23:10.806 --> 23:11.890
There's a subway.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.601
There's a train two blocks that way.

23:14.684 --> 23:15.727
We won't make that.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.111
[Riley] Help us. Please.

23:24.736 --> 23:25.946
Please, help us.

23:34.412 --> 23:35.288
[Puck] Riley Blue.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.791
I knew you'd call.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.877
Puck?

23:41.628 --> 23:42.462
Hop on.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.759
Snuggle up.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.027
Oh! [chuckles]

24:06.736 --> 24:08.488
[both laugh]

24:09.322 --> 24:10.490
Mm...

24:11.283 --> 24:15.120
I don't know about you,
but I'm fricking dead.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.040
It has been a very intense few days.

24:19.124 --> 24:22.335
From Teagan's wedding,
to a political riot,

24:22.419 --> 24:24.087
to a high-speed chase.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.215
There's never a dull moment,
that's for sure.

24:29.092 --> 24:32.846
Is this our life now?
Is this our new normal?

24:34.472 --> 24:36.057
I can think of worse normals.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.227
Are you okay with it?

24:40.353 --> 24:41.438
What do you mean?

24:42.564 --> 24:46.109
I mean... you didn't sign up for all this.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.862
It's not like you did either.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.449
But I don't have a choice.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.036
These voices are in my head
whether I want them or not.

24:56.912 --> 24:57.746
True.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.708
Though, when I think back,

25:02.417 --> 25:04.836
I don't remember
being given a choice either...

25:05.462 --> 25:08.506
when this nerdy girl
walked into City Lights...

25:09.216 --> 25:14.137
and this voice in my head
was telling me, "Whatever you do...

25:14.846 --> 25:17.557
do not let her go
until you get her number."

25:18.225 --> 25:20.227
[both laugh]

25:29.569 --> 25:30.403
What?

25:37.327 --> 25:38.411
Here's the thing.

25:41.748 --> 25:45.168
We all wake up and we have to take
the same Terms and Conditions box:

25:45.835 --> 25:47.629
Everyday stuff will happen to you.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.548
Some of it will be good.
Some of it will be bad.

25:52.342 --> 25:58.265
Choice is less about what happens
than it is about how we deal with it.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.318
I've been thinking a lot
about all the things

26:10.402 --> 26:12.696
that have happened to us
over this past year.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.073
I won't lie.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.785
Sometimes it's terrifying.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.205
And sometimes it's incredibly exciting.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.084
It's been maddening...

26:26.793 --> 26:28.003
enlightening...

26:29.129 --> 26:30.839
confusing...

26:31.798 --> 26:33.633
and always unpredictable.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.014
However...

26:40.307 --> 26:42.851
I don't think there's been a single day

26:43.476 --> 26:48.648
when I didn't hear that same voice
in my head telling me...

26:50.650 --> 26:52.152
"Whatever you do...

26:53.528 --> 26:56.156
do not let her go."

27:07.042 --> 27:08.168
[gasps]

27:08.251 --> 27:09.502
Nomi Marks...

27:11.921 --> 27:12.922
will you marry me?

27:13.006 --> 27:14.215
[gasps]

27:16.384 --> 27:17.385
Oh, my God.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.097
-Oh, my God, I don't believe this.
-What?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.813
Amanita Caplan...

27:32.108 --> 27:33.276
will you marry me?

27:33.360 --> 27:36.321
[both laugh]

27:36.905 --> 27:38.948
Abso-fucking-lutely!

27:41.785 --> 27:42.702
You?

27:42.786 --> 27:44.204
Every day of my life.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.131
[both laugh]

28:08.144 --> 28:09.145
Mm...

28:10.939 --> 28:12.107
Smells so good.

28:13.608 --> 28:16.194
You cannot change the world
on an empty stomach.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.824
Whoa!

28:20.907 --> 28:23.034
What? Are you okay?

28:24.661 --> 28:26.746
[stammers] Yeah. I'm good, Mom.

28:27.956 --> 28:28.873
Okay.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.252
Last year,

28:32.335 --> 28:35.296
when I heard about what you did,
I had a feeling you were one of us.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.966
But then we heard that you were
running for political office.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.219
So we figured you were either crazy
or hunting for BPO.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.430
Still, we were curious.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.433
So, even though no sensate
with half a brain

28:46.516 --> 28:48.476
should go to a public event
like your speech

28:48.560 --> 28:50.270
without taking a blocker first...

28:50.353 --> 28:51.229
...we came.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.647
We heard you.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.152
Mentally, I might--

28:57.235 --> 28:58.945
Kala, I'm home!

28:59.028 --> 29:00.113
Welcome back.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.325
How was your trip?

29:05.076 --> 29:06.661
I need a drink first. You want one?

29:06.745 --> 29:09.914
Yes. That's a very good idea.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.588
I have been thinking about a lot of things

29:16.671 --> 29:19.257
that have been going on with me.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.885
-And with us. And--
-Yes, so have I.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.386
You have?

29:25.221 --> 29:26.055
Cheers.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.398
-Maybe we should sit.
-Yeah.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.608
Um...

29:37.609 --> 29:38.735
Is that a present?

29:38.818 --> 29:41.613
Yes. Um, from your friend Ajay.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.157
A late wedding gift, he said.

29:45.742 --> 29:46.659
Ajay was here?

29:46.743 --> 29:48.411
He was in the neighborhood
and wanted to drop it off.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.955
He only stayed a moment.
But he said we should open it together.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.500
No, Kala, we need to talk.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.043
-Yeah, sure--
-No!

29:55.126 --> 29:57.128
-Has this been x-rayed?
-X-rayed?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.713
Yes, sir. It's safe.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.299
Safe? Rajan, what's going on?

30:02.008 --> 30:04.010
Rajan? What's going on?

30:08.765 --> 30:10.350
Oh, my God.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.646
Oh, it's beautiful.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.649
Ajay's a believer?

30:18.691 --> 30:19.818
No, he's not.

30:21.152 --> 30:21.986
Hey.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.447
What does that say?

30:24.531 --> 30:27.450
"Caution. Easily broken."
Well, that's rather obvious.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.370
It looks like it belongs in a museum.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.997
I will send him a thank-you note.

30:36.918 --> 30:37.752
Are you okay?

30:40.964 --> 30:43.007
Kala, just listen.

30:45.134 --> 30:48.596
I need you to do something for me,
and I know this will be difficult

30:48.680 --> 30:51.641
because I need you to do it
without asking a lot of questions,

30:51.724 --> 30:54.352
which I'm telling you right now
that I cannot answer.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.941
I have not told you
about lots of things that are going on

31:00.024 --> 31:02.110
because I have been trying
to protect you...

31:03.236 --> 31:06.364
and maybe, selfishly, our marriage.

31:09.909 --> 31:12.745
I did not go to Bangalore. I was in Delhi.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.666
I have been cooperating
with Agent Singh and the federal police

31:16.749 --> 31:20.128
on a complex investigation
into political corruption.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.214
Ajay is a part of that investigation.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.426
Oh, my God.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.888
I cannot tell you more
because it will only put you at risk.

31:29.971 --> 31:33.057
But what I need you to do
is get on a plane tonight.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.225
Agent Singh warned me

31:34.309 --> 31:37.562
that it might be necessary
to move my family for their protection.

31:39.355 --> 31:42.108
I purchased a flat in Paris
that nobody knows about.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.485
-What?
-I'm sure you'll be safe there.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.530
Okay, Rajan, I don't under--

31:47.614 --> 31:50.199
Kala, I understand
that this is all a shock.

31:50.283 --> 31:51.993
This is difficult for me, too.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.246
I know you have important things
to discuss with me,

31:55.330 --> 31:57.290
but I'm asking you to hold on,

31:57.373 --> 32:01.419
fully understanding that the future
of our marriage is uncertain,

32:01.502 --> 32:04.339
but that's a small thing
compared to your safety.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.257
If anything were to happen to you,

32:06.341 --> 32:08.092
I could never forgive myself.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.511
Please.

32:11.554 --> 32:12.639
Believe me.

32:13.222 --> 32:14.641
You have to go.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.399
Reports are still coming in
from the guests of Mr. Bak,

32:23.483 --> 32:26.736
but at least six people were killed
and dozens injured.

32:27.236 --> 32:31.950
Witnesses saw Sun Bak, Mr. Bak's sister,
at the center of attacks.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.870
Last year,
Ms. Bak was convicted of embezzlement

32:35.954 --> 32:40.249
and sentenced to ten years in
Cheongju Women's Correctional Institute.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.543
Several weeks ago, she escaped...

32:42.627 --> 32:44.379
Isn't it funny how things work out?

32:44.837 --> 32:45.672
Sh!

32:46.589 --> 32:47.799
I'm not usually the kind of guy

32:47.882 --> 32:51.219
who believes in certain types
of "happy endings," but...

32:51.302 --> 32:52.470
[exhales]

32:52.553 --> 32:54.639
for this, I will make an exception.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.057
Shh!

32:57.892 --> 33:02.146
Ladies, try to see this
from my perspective.

33:03.314 --> 33:07.318
Traditionally, in male narratives...

33:08.569 --> 33:10.029
when you save the, uh...

33:11.489 --> 33:12.699
princess...

33:14.409 --> 33:17.578
it entitles you to certain rewards.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.622
These aren't my rules.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.959
This is just standard operating procedure.

33:23.042 --> 33:24.961
-[toes crack]
-Ahh!

33:25.044 --> 33:27.714
Stop! Ow, ow! Please, stop! Oh!

33:27.797 --> 33:29.340
[groans]

33:29.424 --> 33:31.759
-Go.
-Oh! Oh!

33:32.468 --> 33:33.302
Sit.

33:33.761 --> 33:34.762
Oh!

33:35.596 --> 33:38.391
Ow! That really hurt!

33:40.226 --> 33:42.311
In critical care is Detective Mun,

33:42.395 --> 33:44.981
who was the first officer
to arrive at the scene.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.775
He's still alive.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.319
So, you were there, weren't you,
Minister Park?

33:50.903 --> 33:55.158
That was one of the most terrifying
experiences of my life.

33:55.783 --> 34:00.705
No one is safe until that psychopath
is off our streets.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.209
I should have killed him.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.005
No. Mun was there to arrest him.

34:09.714 --> 34:10.548
They know.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.051
It's going to be okay.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.970
But right now, we have another problem.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.640
We need information.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.602
[Puck muttering]

34:22.685 --> 34:24.312
You're the naughty one.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.028
Oh!

34:32.612 --> 34:34.072
Change of heart.

34:34.655 --> 34:35.490
I see.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.408
How many sensates are you connected to?

34:37.492 --> 34:40.995
Well, I'm not usually one to brag,
but there's--

34:41.079 --> 34:42.663
Ow! Three-hundred-eighty-seven!

34:42.747 --> 34:44.874
Three-hundred-eighty-seven, I said.
Oh, God!

34:44.957 --> 34:46.292
We need those connections.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.294
What for?

34:48.377 --> 34:49.587
-To fight.
-To fight.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.130
[laughs] Oh, to fight.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.053
Well...

34:58.137 --> 35:01.849
I tell you, this is the opposite

35:01.933 --> 35:04.185
of what I would call
a satisfying encounter.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.645
Don't let him leave.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.564
Stay away from me.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.024
Don't hurt him.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.901
We need to get him to trust us.

35:11.984 --> 35:13.903
Bowling ball's here, is he?

35:14.570 --> 35:16.447
Good. Where is he?

35:17.907 --> 35:19.492
Over here, male narrative.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.494
And what's with the hair?

35:21.577 --> 35:24.247
-What's with the hair?
-Yeah, what's with the hair?

35:25.581 --> 35:27.166
Don't know what you're talking about.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.961
I don't.

35:30.962 --> 35:31.879
Listen...

35:33.214 --> 35:36.425
I am a lover, I'm not a fighter.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.429
You guys want a sens-orgy
that circles the globe, I'm your guy.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.682
You guys want to storm
the ramparts, then--

35:42.765 --> 35:44.767
-Puck.
-Holy shit.

35:45.351 --> 35:46.352
Get away from them.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.187
Leave this town.

35:48.896 --> 35:51.107
You need to be on blockers 24/7.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.865
I have to go. If you guys
want to kill me, then just do it quick.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.158
What just happened?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.910
-I've been quarantined.
-Why?

36:04.245 --> 36:06.539
The Cannibal. He's hunting.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.668
[sighs]

36:43.201 --> 36:44.202
Huh...

36:44.660 --> 36:45.745
I was looking for this.

36:48.414 --> 36:49.540
So you told him?

36:50.958 --> 36:53.085
-No, not yet.
-Why? What happened?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.713
I'm not sure.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.089
But you're still leaving?

36:58.633 --> 37:03.012
Rajan is involved in some kind
of corruption investigation.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.264
Rajan? Is he being investigated?

37:05.348 --> 37:07.099
No, his friend.

37:07.642 --> 37:10.019
Huh. Interesting.

37:10.102 --> 37:13.022
Why? Why is that interesting?

37:13.773 --> 37:16.943
Because both of the men in your life
are connected to criminals.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.528
What does that say about you?

37:19.612 --> 37:20.488
Hmm.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.367
I'm sure it speaks volumes
about my poor choices,

37:24.867 --> 37:28.454
my own dishonesty, indecency,
and general lack of good character.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.375
When you put it like that,
it sounds very sexy.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.752
Mnh-mnh. No, I...

37:35.753 --> 37:36.629
Why?

37:40.424 --> 37:42.385
Because right now I need something.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.555
I need to know something...

37:48.349 --> 37:50.476
before I get any more confused.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.645
And every time I kiss you,

37:52.728 --> 37:55.731
I'm always left even more confused
than I ever was.

37:58.401 --> 38:01.862
But before I get on a plane
and go anywhere...

38:03.739 --> 38:08.494
before I discover
what it actually feels like...

38:09.412 --> 38:11.747
to be in the same room with you...

38:14.875 --> 38:17.753
before I know what it really feels like...

38:18.796 --> 38:21.507
to have these lips against mine and...

38:23.217 --> 38:24.844
not just in my head...

38:26.637 --> 38:28.764
something I might be imagining...

38:31.475 --> 38:33.185
I need to know something.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.522
What?

38:38.441 --> 38:39.942
Something true.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.612
I've never lied to you.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.617
But you haven't told me
the whole truth either.

38:50.786 --> 38:52.621
If I told you the whole truth...

38:55.916 --> 39:00.338
if I told you that you're
the last thought I have before I sleep...

39:01.797 --> 39:05.009
if I told you that you're
the first thought I have when I wake...

39:06.385 --> 39:08.137
-if I told you...
-Tell me.

39:10.097 --> 39:12.099
...how much I love you...

39:14.602 --> 39:16.187
would it have done any good?

39:17.897 --> 39:20.149
-Yes.
-How?

39:22.151 --> 39:25.071
Because it would help me admit
how much I love you.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.415
Have you ever been to Paris?

39:37.917 --> 39:40.336
Good! Because I want it to be just for us.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.546
[laughs]

39:46.884 --> 39:49.804
Welcome home, sexy. I've missed you.

39:50.721 --> 39:51.722
What?

39:52.932 --> 39:53.933
What's wrong?

39:54.558 --> 39:56.769
Oh. Is she with you?

39:57.353 --> 39:59.063
Isn't that just too perfect?

39:59.146 --> 40:00.314
It's her.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.983
[Lila] I warned you, Wolfgang.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.694
There are only two sides in this world:

40:05.778 --> 40:07.947
with me or against me.

40:09.782 --> 40:14.328
Imagine my surprise when I found out
how badly the Cannibal wanted you.

40:17.456 --> 40:18.290
Open!

40:19.500 --> 40:20.626
Move! Move! Move! Move!

40:23.921 --> 40:25.047
[electricity crackling]

40:25.131 --> 40:26.924
[gasps, groans]

40:27.007 --> 40:31.011
Ah! [groaning]

40:43.858 --> 40:45.359
Hello, Wolfgang.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.737
[gasps]

40:55.327 --> 40:56.662
When they slice you up,

40:57.204 --> 40:59.832
I want the last face you think of
to be mine.

41:08.632 --> 41:09.675
Oh, my God!

41:10.342 --> 41:12.803
Oh, my-- Oh, my God!

41:12.887 --> 41:14.555
Help! Help us, please!

41:16.474 --> 41:17.433
[Kala] Sun!

41:17.516 --> 41:19.518
It's Whispers, he's got Wolfgang!

41:20.102 --> 41:21.020
Oh, my God!

41:21.562 --> 41:24.815
Lito, Capheus! Please! [gasps]

41:24.899 --> 41:27.401
It's Lila! Wolfgang's in trouble!

41:27.943 --> 41:30.279
Help! Oh, God, please, help us! Please.

41:35.659 --> 41:36.827
What can we do?

41:37.369 --> 41:39.079
I have a plan. But...

41:39.163 --> 41:40.331
we're gonna need blockers.

41:41.624 --> 41:42.791
Okay.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.699
[Devi] Kala, if you are gonna make
your flight, you have to leave now.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.743
Yeah. I'm leaving. I'm coming.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.512
I'm sorry, baby.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.348
I'm so sorry.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.433
[panting]

42:42.268 --> 42:43.769
Oh, there you are.

42:44.353 --> 42:45.396
I've been waiting.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.440
As you can see, I'm eager to get started.

42:53.362 --> 42:55.739
This is the Traceworks.

42:56.782 --> 43:00.786
Your mother, Angelica,
was instrumental to the success of it.

43:01.787 --> 43:04.290
This organization owes much to her.

43:05.082 --> 43:11.255
Now, the, uh, psycellium
is very sensitive to pain.

43:11.338 --> 43:14.091
But acute pain produces one
of the clearest echoes

43:14.174 --> 43:16.176
that we are able to trace.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.637
I'm going to fucking kill you.

43:20.431 --> 43:23.225
This really is my favorite part.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.855
[groaning]

43:41.160 --> 43:42.036
Paddles.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.417
Now.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.711
-[electricity crackling]
-[groaning]

43:50.794 --> 43:51.962
-Ah!
-Oh!

43:52.046 --> 43:52.880
[moans]

43:53.422 --> 43:56.508
Ah! [panting]

43:57.760 --> 43:58.594
Again.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.055
-[electricity crackling]
-[screams]

44:01.138 --> 44:02.139
[all groaning]

44:03.390 --> 44:05.517
Ah! [screams]

44:14.276 --> 44:16.612
Yes. Once more.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.030
[screams]

44:20.991 --> 44:22.368
-Stop.
-[gasps]

44:23.160 --> 44:24.161
Ah!

44:26.997 --> 44:27.831
Now...

44:29.625 --> 44:32.795
tell me the first thought
that comes to your mind.

44:32.878 --> 44:33.962
[gasping]

44:53.190 --> 44:54.274
[Whispers] Kala.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.403
Ms. Kala Rasal.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.448
Thank you, Wolfgang.

45:02.574 --> 45:04.368
You see how easy that was?

45:06.078 --> 45:07.413
That's all for now.

45:25.764 --> 45:29.726
Why won't you tell me what's wrong?
Capheus, huh?

45:29.977 --> 45:31.770
I've never seen you like this.

45:35.274 --> 45:39.111
My son greets the morning
feeling today might be a beautiful day.

45:52.708 --> 45:53.959
[groans]

46:13.479 --> 46:14.521
Regrets?

46:18.525 --> 46:19.526
They will come.

46:20.569 --> 46:22.863
[electricity crackling]

46:22.946 --> 46:24.406
[groaning]

46:28.076 --> 46:29.745
-[groaning]
-[screaming]

46:42.674 --> 46:43.717
Oh, my God.

46:44.593 --> 46:45.719
Dani!

46:46.261 --> 46:47.221
Dani!

46:47.846 --> 46:49.389
-Call an ambulance.
-No, no.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.975
-Call an ambulance, please!
-I can't get to a hospital.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.185
What are you talking about?

46:53.268 --> 46:55.062
Come on, what's wrong with you, baby?

46:55.145 --> 46:56.730
We have to get to London.

46:56.813 --> 46:57.898
I'll explain everything.

46:57.981 --> 46:59.942
-We have to get to London.
-What are you talking about?

47:09.535 --> 47:11.537
[both speaking Korean]

47:21.463 --> 47:23.924
This is for you.
Your gate today is number 38.

47:24.007 --> 47:25.217
To your right-hand side.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.593
-Have a safe flight.
-Thank you.

47:29.596 --> 47:30.889
[beeping]

47:39.731 --> 47:40.691
[speaks Korean]

47:41.817 --> 47:43.193
[speaks Korean]

47:46.446 --> 47:47.656
[Whispers] Good morning.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.993
How is our patient doing this morning?

47:52.828 --> 47:53.662
Now...

47:55.789 --> 47:57.833
who else is in there?

47:59.835 --> 48:03.839
Eventually, you will tell me,
whether you want to or not.

48:05.674 --> 48:06.925
Paddles.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.845
-[grunting]
-[electricity crackling]

48:12.389 --> 48:15.183
[gasping]

48:16.059 --> 48:21.064
Now... where is Mr. Gorski hiding?

48:23.609 --> 48:25.986
-How do I stop this?
-You cooperate.

48:26.069 --> 48:28.280
-Like you?
-I know what happened.

48:28.363 --> 48:31.575
I've seen it enough times.
I've experienced it.

48:36.830 --> 48:38.832
There's only one way to end it.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.888
Jonas was right.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.101
I just want one thing.

48:59.728 --> 49:01.396
Let me guess.

49:02.230 --> 49:03.649
Leave Riley alone.

49:05.317 --> 49:06.943
I'll give you anything you want.

49:16.828 --> 49:18.288
Of course I should agree.

49:19.873 --> 49:21.708
I should promise you this and that

49:21.792 --> 49:25.087
in order to leash the rest of your cluster
as quickly as possible,

49:25.170 --> 49:29.383
but we both know
that would be a complete lie.

49:31.134 --> 49:33.470
We both know
exactly what's going to happen.

49:35.389 --> 49:39.434
One by one,
I'm going to hunt your cluster down.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.604
And no matter what you do,

49:43.105 --> 49:45.065
I will find Ms. Gunnarsdottir.

49:47.526 --> 49:52.072
And I will enjoy feeling you
experience her death...

49:53.407 --> 49:58.495
inch by inch, piece by piece.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.832
There's just one tiny problem
with that plan.

50:01.915 --> 50:03.250
And what is that?

50:03.917 --> 50:05.168
Me.

50:07.754 --> 50:09.423
Oh, God.

50:10.006 --> 50:10.924
You're here.

50:11.466 --> 50:13.677
No! I can't visit you.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.429
That's right, Milt, old pal.

50:15.512 --> 50:18.014
You can't visit me
because I'm actually here.

50:21.727 --> 50:22.644
Angelica.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.354
[Will] There's no one behind the glass.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.898
That camera's dead.

50:26.982 --> 50:28.191
It's a soundproof room.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.736
[grunting]

50:30.819 --> 50:32.904
Will, stop it.

50:33.530 --> 50:35.198
-Jonas.
-Jonas?

50:35.282 --> 50:36.116
[coughing]

50:36.199 --> 50:37.409
You're on blockers.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.703
Jonas, this is it.

50:39.786 --> 50:42.664
You have to choose. Whose side are you on?

50:42.748 --> 50:44.291
I'm sorry, Will...

50:45.208 --> 50:47.461
but you won't understand this choice
right now.

50:49.087 --> 50:50.756
[stammers] Don't leave me!

50:51.339 --> 50:54.760
You all alone, Milt?
Let me put you out of your misery.

51:07.647 --> 51:08.648
Now.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.160
Mr. Secretary, get me the Chairman.

51:20.243 --> 51:21.328
[knocking on door]

51:22.120 --> 51:24.539
We have an emergency
at the Parliament facility.

51:24.623 --> 51:25.999
[knocking continues]

51:27.501 --> 51:28.668
Oh, fuck.

51:42.307 --> 51:43.266
[beeping]

51:47.562 --> 51:49.064
[beeping]

51:50.857 --> 51:53.401
Wait. Hold on.

51:53.485 --> 51:55.987
Security protocol has been activated.

51:58.990 --> 52:00.951
[beeping]

52:01.034 --> 52:02.077
It's not reading.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.912
I'm going to have to call this in.

52:06.957 --> 52:10.126
[indistinct shouting]

52:10.210 --> 52:12.337
On your knees! Hands above your head!

53:48.934 --> 53:50.018
You want a war?

53:51.937 --> 53:53.355
We'll give you a war.
