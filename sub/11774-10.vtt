WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:08.209
( theme music playing )

00:11.779 --> 00:14.215
I'VE BEEN DREADING

00:14.315 --> 00:16.016
TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS
WHOLE MADOFF THING.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.951
OH, WELL--

00:18.052 --> 00:20.121
YOU MUST HATE ME
FOR LOSING ALL OUR MONEY.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.656
LOOK AT ME.
I'M LIVING WITH JERRY.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.892
WE'RE WIPED OUT.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.561
ACTUALLY, I'M FINE, GEORGE.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.330
FINE?

00:29.430 --> 00:32.166
I TOOK MY HALF OUT OF MADOFF
RIGHT AFTER WE GOT DIVORCED.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.835
- YOU WHAT?
- I STILL HAVE MY HALF.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.970
WAIT A SECOND.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.107
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- IT'S GOOD, YEAH.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.075
IT'S GOOD.
KEEP GOING.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.377
- OKAY.
- WHY DID YOU TAKE IT OUT?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.913
I BUMPED INTO MADOFF
ON THE STREET ONE DAY

00:46.013 --> 00:48.316
AND HE WAS WEARING
THIS QUILTED JACKET
WITH THE COLLAR UP.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.085
AND FOR SOME REASON
IT JUST CREEPED ME OUT.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.254
SO THE NEXT DAY I PULLED
ALL MY MONEY OUT.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.922
THAT'S--
THAT'S MY MONEY!

00:55.022 --> 00:56.424
YOU HAVE MY MONEY!

00:56.524 --> 00:59.493
NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.362
( laughing )

01:01.462 --> 01:03.030
Man:
AND THE WAITRESS
BRINGS THE CHECK.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.798
- NO, LET ME.
- I GOT IT.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.367
- I GOT IT.
- I GOT IT.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.835
- I GOT IT.
- WOULD YOU LET ME
GET THE CHECK!?

01:07.935 --> 01:09.637
OKAY, JEEZ.

01:14.442 --> 01:18.579
FORGOT TO GO
TO THE CASH MACHINE.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.348
- ( laughing )
- Man: CUT.
THAT'S IT FOR SCENE 8.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.650
WE'RE RIGHT BACK
HERE TOMORROW.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.285
THAT'S A WRAP.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.620
THAT WAS GREAT.
REALLY FUNNY.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.590
I DON'T KNOW.
WAS THE PACE OF THAT RIGHT?

01:29.690 --> 01:31.759
- NO, IT WAS PERFECT.
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
- ( groans )

01:31.859 --> 01:33.026
THAT WAS SO FUNNY,
THAT ENDING.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.562
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.864
I'M DONE.
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO THE PROP GUY.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.432
THE GLASSES
ARE A LITTLE OFF.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.967
- OKAY.
- THANKS, CHERYL.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.870
- OKAY.
- OKAY, GOOD JOB.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.407
- FANTASTIC.
- NO, BE HONEST WITH ME.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.576
I'M BEING HONEST.
YOU WERE FANTASTIC.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.744
I AM NOT FANTASTIC.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.280
YOU ARE.
AND THEY LIKE YOU.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.282
- THEY LIKE YOU.
- WHO LIKES ME?

01:54.382 --> 01:56.350
JASON LIKES YOU.
JERRY LIKES YOU.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.719
JULIA LIKES YOU.
THEY ALL LIKE YOU.
MICHAEL.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.954
I LIKE YOU.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.924
- YOU HAVING FUN HERE?
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.093
- IT'S LIKE YOUR THING.
- I KNOW, I'M HAVING
A GREAT TIME.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.095
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
THE MAN, YOU KNOW?

02:08.196 --> 02:11.098
- NO BIG DEAL.
- IT'S THE "SEINFELD" REUNION.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.467
- I KNOW.
- THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.369
- IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.
- AND YOU'RE IN IT.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.571
YEAH.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.320
- HEY, HOW'S MICHAEL DOING?
- HE'S DOING GREAT.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.456
- HE IS?
- YEAH, THE GROAT'S DISEASE
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.391
- SO HE DOESN'T HAVE GROAT'S?
- NO, HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.194
- HE'S FINE.
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.730
- YEAH.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.199
I WAS--
I'M STILL--

02:45.299 --> 02:48.569
THERE ARE STILL MOMENTS
IN THIS SCRIPT THAT
I'M TRYING TO FIND.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.038
- REALLY?
- I DON'T KNOW, I THOUGHT
MAYBE WE COULD

02:51.138 --> 02:52.906
GET TOGETHER OR SOMETHING.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.575
SURE, YEAH.

02:54.675 --> 02:58.111
WHAT ABOUT AFTER
JULIA'S BOOK PARTY
FOR JASON?

02:58.212 --> 03:00.080
DEFINITELY.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.583
- THAT'D BE GREAT.
- I'LL COME OVER RIGHT
AFTER THE BOOK PARTY.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.752
- TERRIFIC.
- IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.153
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.188
- IS THAT JASON'S CAR?
- YEAH.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.857
WHAT'S WITH
THE TINTED WINDOWS?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.359
I THINK HE LIKES
HIS PRIVACY.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.160
YOU KNOW,
BEING A CELEBRITY--

03:13.261 --> 03:15.529
WHAT IS HE,
GEORGE CLOONEY?
I MEAN, COME ON.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.332
IT ALSO IS HELPFUL
WITH THE SUN.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.402
AND HE TAKES HIS DOGS
WITH HIM EVERYWHERE SO IT
PROBABLY GETS HOT IN THERE.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.870
BOY, YOU KNOW A LOT
ABOUT THIS GUY.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.438
WE SPEND A LOT
OF TIME TOGETHER

03:24.538 --> 03:26.974
JUST TALKING ABOUT NOTHING
BETWEEN TAKES.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.743
- TALKING ABOUT THE KITCHEN.
- HEY, LARRY. HEY, CHERYL.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.312
- HEY, MOCHA JOE.
- HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

03:31.412 --> 03:33.681
YOU HAVE THE BEST
VANILLA DECAF LATTE.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.983
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES.
- WELL, A LITTLE SECRET.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.818
- YOU GOT SOME
SECRETS, MOCHA JOE?
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.620
- I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT IT SOMEDAY.
- OKAY.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.221
HEY, WHERE YOU
GOING WITH THIS?

03:41.322 --> 03:42.690
I WAS GOING OVER
TO THE PRODUCTION OFFICE.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.358
- OUR OFFICE?
- YEAH, YOUR OFFICE.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.394
- COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
- YEAH, SURE.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.095
COULD YOU BRING SOME
JUMPER CABLES TO TIM KAISER?

03:48.195 --> 03:49.797
- I'VE GOT TO RETURN THEM.
- YEAH, SURE.

03:49.897 --> 03:54.067
- REALLY?
THAT WOULD BE FABULOUS
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.103
- THANKS, MOCHA JOE.
- THAT'S IT, RIGHT?

03:56.203 --> 04:00.173
- JUST BRING THESE TO
THE PRODUCTION OFFICE?
- GIVE THEM TO TIM KAISER.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.075
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
- THANKS.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.211
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT
ABOUT THE COFFEE.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.480
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.016
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.784
I REALLY LIKE
YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.388
- OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.257
WE'VE JUST BEEN GETTING
ALONG SO GREAT.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.993
AND WHEN WE WERE WALKING
OUT OF THE STAGE TODAY

04:20.093 --> 04:23.130
SHE INVITED ME TO HER HOUSE

04:23.230 --> 04:24.898
TONIGHT TO GO OVER LINES.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.334
- REALLY?
- YES.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.836
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- WOW.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.604
SO IT'S LIKE A DATE,
I GUESS.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.272
I THINK YOU SHOULD
MAKE A MOVE TONIGHT.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.141
- NAH.
- YEAH.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.309
- WHAT?
- MAKE A MOVE.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.210
I CAN'T.
WHENEVER I MAKE A MOVE

04:37.311 --> 04:39.813
- YOU SEE IT A MILE AWAY.
IT'S LIKE A POKER TELL.
- NO NO NO.

04:39.913 --> 04:43.384
BECAUSE I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT, MY CONVERSATION
GETS VERY STILTED.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.819
SHE INVITED YOU.
YOU MUST MAKE A MOVE.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.756
I'M SO HAPPY JUST TO BE
GOING OVER THERE,

04:48.856 --> 04:51.792
BEING CLOSE WITH HER,
I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT
THE MOVE.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.928
YOU REALIZE ALL YOUR DREAMS
ARE COMING TRUE?

04:55.028 --> 04:59.299
- YOUR WHOLE PLAN
IS COMING TO FRUITION.
- YES, I KNOW.

05:05.373 --> 05:08.676
- AH, THE ACTOR PREPARES.
- YEAH.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.579
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WOW.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.214
I LOVE THE FACE.
DON'T YOU LOVE THE FACE?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.350
- THE BURNING INTENSITY, YES.
- YEAH.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.419
THE LET'S CUT THE CRAP,
YOU KNOW?

05:18.519 --> 05:21.321
IT'S NOT SO MUCH AS A BOOK

05:21.422 --> 05:23.323
AS A PAMPHLET,
YOU KNOW?

05:23.424 --> 05:24.792
KIND OF ON THE THIN SIDE,
ISN'T IT?

05:24.892 --> 05:26.727
HE'S SAYING
"ACTING WITHOUT ACTING."

05:26.827 --> 05:30.063
SO IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA ACT
THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT TO SAY.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.499
"ACTING WITHOUT ACTING."

05:31.599 --> 05:33.467
- YEAH, EVERYTHING IS WITHOUT.
- YEAH.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.335
RAISE YOUR KIDS
WITHOUT RAISING THEM.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.870
( laughs )

05:36.970 --> 05:38.639
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS KIND OF ANNOYING?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.509
HAVE YOU NOTICED PEOPLE ARE
SAYING, "HAVING SAID THAT"

05:41.609 --> 05:43.577
- AFTER EVERYTHING
THEY SAY NOW?
- YES.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.746
HAVING SAID THAT,
LET ME SAY THIS.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.482
- RIGHT RIGHT. YOU SAY WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT TO SAY...
- YEAH.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.217
...AND THEN YOU NEGATE IT.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.253
NOW HAVING SAID THAT.
SO WHAT IS THAT?
SO YOU WIN EITHER WAY.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.188
A COMEDIAN GOES UP ON STAGE,

05:55.288 --> 05:56.924
"YOU PEOPLE ARE
A BUNCH OF MORONS.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.661
HAVING SAID THAT,
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE."

06:00.761 --> 06:02.763
HEY, I TALKED TO YOUR BUDDY
MOCHA JOE A MINUTE AGO.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.865
YOU KNOW, HE'S A LITTLE
UPSET THAT YOU DIDN'T
GIVE HIM ANYTHING

06:04.965 --> 06:07.435
FOR TAKING THOSE JUMPER
CABLES TO TIM KAISER.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.537
- HE SAID SOMETHING TO YOU?
- YEAH, HE DID.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.005
- WHAT?
- HE MADE A COMMENT
THAT LARRY--

06:12.105 --> 06:14.742
BOY, IT TAKES A LOT TO GET
A TIP OUT OF THAT GUY.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.645
I ASKED HIM TO DO ME A FAVOR.
I DIDN'T SAY I WANT TO HIRE YOU.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.448
- I SAID DO ME A FAVOR.
- THAT'S WHAT A TIP IS.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.583
A TIP IS MONEY FOR A FAVOR.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.986
NO, A FAVOR IMPLIES NO TIP.

06:26.086 --> 06:29.457
SOMEONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE TIPPED WAS NOT TIPPED.
YOU'D BETTER TIP HIM.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.192
- SALUTATIONS, ME LADS.
- HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.827
HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO SEE YOU.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.096
YOU'RE REALLY CUTTING
THE FIGURE THESE DAYS.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.465
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.567
- CONGRATS.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.469
- THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.638
- HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE?
- THAT'S ABOUT A YEAR
AND CHANGE OF MY LIFE.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.040
- REALLY?
- YEAH. YEAH YEAH YEAH.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.876
YET IT'S VERY CONCISE.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.344
YEAH, I TRIED TO GET IT
DOWN TO THE ESSENTIALS.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.481
YEAH, I'LL READ IT
WITH DINNER.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.617
YEAH, WHAT DOES "ACTING
WITHOUT ACTING" MEAN?

06:56.717 --> 06:59.820
IT JUST MEANS YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THE ACTOR AT WORK.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.822
- RIGHT.
- YOU WANT TO HIDE
THE TECHNIQUE.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.992
IT'S ACTING.
IT'S DOING THE JOB.
IT'S THE CRAFT.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.361
- SO YOU HIDE
THE ACTOR'S EFFORT.
- BUT HE'S STILL ACTING.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.564
- YEAH, OF COURSE
YOU'RE ACTING.
- RIGHT.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.800
SO IT COULD BE
"ACTING WITH ACTING."

07:12.900 --> 07:15.202
- THAT COULD BE A TITLE TOO.
- Larry: YEAH.

07:15.302 --> 07:19.072
HAVING SAID THAT,
I THINK THIS IS
A TERRIFIC TITLE.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.875
- THANKS.
- HEY, LAR. LAR.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.344
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
JUST FOR A SEC?
- OH, SURE.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.548
IT IS WITHOUT ACTING.
IT'S HIDING THE ACTING.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.051
RIGHT, IT'S HIDING THE ACTING
AND YET IT'S ALL ACTING.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.587
- MOST OF IT.
- YEAH.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.490
UH, WERE YOU SITTING HERE?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.791
- MM-HMM.
- EARLIER? YOU WERE?

07:37.891 --> 07:41.562
HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU
TO USE A COASTER?

07:42.395 --> 07:44.532
- LOOK.
- OH.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.433
I AM A LITTLE BIT FREAKED
OUT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW

07:46.534 --> 07:48.368
THIS TABLE HAS BEEN
IN THE LOUIS-DREYFUS FAMILY

07:48.468 --> 07:50.370
FOR GENERATIONS, OKAY?
AND LOOK AT IT.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.840
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
PUT MY GLASS DOWN THERE.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.842
- I HELD ONTO IT.
- NO NO NO, BUT YOU WERE HERE.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.645
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THE GLASS
NEVER LEFT MY HAND.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.447
WHEN I'M IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS
I ALWAYS HOLD ONTO MY GLASS.

08:00.548 --> 08:03.450
IT MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE
AND SECURE AND I DON'T HAVE
TO SHAKE HANDS.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.954
LISTEN, ONE OF THESE
FRIENDS OF JASON TOLD ME,

08:07.054 --> 08:09.557
"OH, LARRY DID THAT.
LARRY DAVID DID THAT.
HE WAS JUST SITTING HERE."

08:09.657 --> 08:11.358
- SO SAID THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HIS NAME IS.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.561
I DON'T KNOW WHO ANY
OF THESE PEOPLE ARE IN
MY HOUSE, BY THE WAY.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.195
WHERE IS HE?
WHICH FRIEND?

08:15.295 --> 08:18.866
WELL, LOOK IT, YOU SAY YOU
WOULD NEVER PUT A WET GLASS

08:18.966 --> 08:20.568
DOWN ON AN ANTIQUE
WOODEN TABLE.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.435
- NO, IMPOSSIBLE.
- ALL RIGHT, I BELIEVE YOU.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.738
HAVING SAID THAT,

08:24.838 --> 08:27.608
I DON'T REALLY THINK
I'M BUYING YOUR LINE
OF BULLSHIT.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.518
- MOCHA JOE.
- OH, HOW YOU DOING, LARRY?

08:38.619 --> 08:42.890
SO I UNDERSTAND YOU
WERE A LITTLE UPSET

08:42.990 --> 08:45.826
THAT I DIDN'T
GIVE YOU A TIP

08:45.926 --> 08:48.295
FOR TAKING THE JUMPER
CABLES TO THE OFFICE.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.697
- IS THAT TRUE?
- I'M NOT UPSET,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.899
BUT I'M A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTED.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.501
MOCHA JOE, I ASKED
YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.537
- THAT'S A FAVOR.
- YEAH, BUT YOU TIP
FOR A FAVOR, LARRY.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.973
IF YOU ASKED ME TO DO YOU
A FAVOR I WOULD SAY YES.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.742
I WOULDN'T EXPECT
ANY MONEY IN RETURN.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.677
- I WOULD DO IT OUT OF
THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART.
- REALLY?

09:03.777 --> 09:06.179
- YOU WOULD DO ME A FAVOR OUT OF
THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART?
- OF COURSE I WOULD.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.216
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT:
YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND WE'RE EVEN.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.754
- WHAT'S THE FAVOR?
- GO INTO WEST HOLLYWOOD

09:13.854 --> 09:16.657
TO STERN BROS. COFFEE
AND PICK UP MY COFFEE ORDER
FOR TOMORROW.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.292
MOCHA JOE, THAT'S INSANE.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.996
HOLLYWOOD IS THE EXACT
OPPOSITE DIRECTION
OF WHERE I LIVE.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.298
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?
IF YOU DON'T DO THE FAVOR,
WE GOT NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.367
- NOW GET AWAY FROM MY CART.
- ALL RIGHT, MOCHA JOE.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.737
- NO, THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT, LARRY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:29.837 --> 09:31.571
I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.
I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.174
I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG
ABOUT NOT TIPPING YOU.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.409
- OH REALLY?
- AND I WANT TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

09:36.509 --> 09:37.510
- OKAY.
- I WANT TO TIP YOU NOW.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.279
- NO.
- FORGET THIS FAVOR.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.481
- NO NO NO NO.
- NO, I'LL TIP YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU A TIP.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.050
NO, YOU SAID YOU
WOULD DO ME THE FAVOR.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.585
NOW YOU'RE GOING BACK
AND YOU WANT TO PAY ME OFF?

09:45.686 --> 09:47.855
- I WANT TO GO BACK IN TIME...
- GO BACK IN TIME?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.557
- ...GIVE YOU THE TIP
THE YOU DESERVED...
- YEAH.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.925
...FOR TAKING THE JUMPER
CABLES TO THE OFFICE

09:52.025 --> 09:53.727
EVEN THOUGH YOU
WERE GOING THERE

09:53.827 --> 09:55.062
AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE TIP
THAT I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.697
NO GOING BACK IN TIME.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.299
YOU SAID YOU
WOULD DO ME A FAVOR.
NOW DO ME A FAVOR.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.137
OKAY, MOCHA JOE.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.740
I'LL GO TO HOLLYWOOD.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.877
I'LL PICK UP
YOUR BEANS, OKAY?

10:09.977 --> 10:12.746
HERE'S THE CARD
FOR STERN BROS. COFFEE,
WEST HOLLYWOOD.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.982
PICK UP THAT COFFEE FOR ME.
BRING IT TO THE STUDIO TOMORROW.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.617
- THAT SQUARES US?
- YEAH, THAT'LL SQUARE US.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.687
SEE YOU TOMORROW, LARRY.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.989
- OH.
- OH, HI.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.057
I HARDLY GOT A CHANCE
TO TALK TO YOU.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.660
- I KNOW.
- SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.696
- SEE YOU LATER.
- GREAT.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.899
WHAT? WE'RE WORKING.
WE'RE DOING SOME WORK.

10:31.999 --> 10:35.502
WE ARE.
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.905
( horns honking )

10:40.741 --> 10:43.176
GOD DAMN IT!

10:49.783 --> 10:51.885
- Cheryl: Hello?
- HEY, IT'S ME.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.587
- Hey.
- UM, LOOK,

10:54.688 --> 10:56.089
I THINK I'M GONNA
BE LATE.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.624
I'M IN BAD TRAFFIC.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.928
I'VE GOT TO GO INTO
HOLLYWOOD TO PICK UP
SOME BEANS FOR MOCHA JOE.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.396
What are you doing?
You're picking up beans?

11:03.496 --> 11:06.499
IT'S A LONG STORY.
I'M GONNA BE LIKE
AN HOUR LATE.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.703
Oh my God.
I thought you were
on your way over.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.638
I AM.
I MEAN, I CAN,
YOU KNOW.

11:11.739 --> 11:15.275
- IT'S ONLY AN HOUR.
- I know, but you're
gonna take an hour?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.577
I think we should just do--
we'll do it another time.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.612
( sighs )

11:19.713 --> 11:22.816
- Okay?
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.952
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:25.052 --> 11:28.155
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.090
All right, thanks, Larry.
Bye.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.959
BYE.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.044
( knocking )

11:51.144 --> 11:53.380
HEY!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.384
FUCKING MOCHA JOE!

12:00.921 --> 12:03.090
SO HOW'S IT GOING
WITH CHERYL?

12:03.190 --> 12:04.958
- REALLY GOOD.
- SHE GOT ANYTHING?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.693
YEAH.
YEAH, SHE'S GOOD.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.461
- I LIKE WHAT SHE'S DOING.
- REALLY?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.497
EASY TO WORK WITH.
WE GOT TOGETHER LAST NIGHT
AT HER PLACE.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.000
- OH REALLY?
- CHERYL CALLS ME UP,
SHE SAYS COME ON OVER.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.169
- I GO OVER, WE WORKED
FOR LIKE TWO HOURS.
- WOW.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.239
- WHEN HAS
AN ACTRESS DONE THAT?
- SO WHICH SHIRT DO YOU LIKE?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.809
PICK ONE OUT.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.844
HEY, LAR.
LAR.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.279
THE GUY CAME,
I GOT AN ESTIMATE

12:26.379 --> 12:29.682
AND IT'S GONNA COST 500 BUCKS
TO FIX THAT TABLE.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.451
THE RING.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.522
- I...
- YES YOU DID.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.724
COME ON, MAN.
YES YOU DID.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.092
PLEASE DON'T PLAY
THIS GAME WITH ME.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.162
I WOULD TELL YOU
IF I LEFT IT.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.998
I RESPECT WOOD.
I REVERE WOOD.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.599
I'M CONSIDERATE OF WOOD.

12:46.699 --> 12:50.303
LAR, I HAVE KNOWN YOU
SINCE 1983.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.005
- WHATEVER IT IS.
- FOUR. YEAH, FOUR.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.508
I KNOW WHEN YOU ARE LYING.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.678
AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE DOING
THAT THING WITH YOUR MOUTH
WHEN IT'S LIKE...

12:58.778 --> 13:01.281
REALLY?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.315
SERIOUSLY?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.417
I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT
THE MONEY, LARRY.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.718
JUST FESS UP, MAN.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.021
IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT,
WHO DID IT?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.757
- YOU'RE THE PERSON--
- I'M GOING TO FIND OUT.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.259
- OH, PLEASE.
- I WILL FIND OUT

13:12.359 --> 13:14.127
AND I WILL DRAG
THAT PERSON BY THE HAIR

13:14.227 --> 13:16.864
AND BRING HIM INTO
YOUR DRESSING ROOM SOON.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.466
- OH, MAN.
- OKAY, SCENE S IS UP.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.735
WE'RE IN JERRY'S APARTMENT.
IT'S GEORGE AND AMANDA.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.437
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.640
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU
AND THE THERAPIST SAYS

13:27.740 --> 13:29.409
THAT MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER SIDE TO YOU.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.578
NOT JUST ANOTHER--
DOZENS.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.214
HOW ABOUT THAT?
HOW ABOUT THAT?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.216
- SO WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN?
- SIT DOWN.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.419
YEAH, COME ON.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME POPCORN?
BECAUSE I MADE IT.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.788
- WAIT, IS THAT IN THERE?
- UH-HUH, I MADE IT.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.523
I KNOW, BUT I DON'T
SAY I MADE IT.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.859
- NO, I SAY I MADE IT.
- I KNOW, IT WAS SO CONVINCING.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.794
I'M PLAYING GEORGE.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.463
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS BIT.
- IT'S GREAT.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.100
BUT IT SAYS THAT THEY
FIGHT OVER THE POPCORN.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.003
- IS IT LIKE WRESTLING?
- NO NO, IT'S NOT WRESTLING.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.171
YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH
YOUR HANDS, OKAY?

13:58.271 --> 14:01.041
- YEAH.
- Jerry: LET IT GO.
WHEREVER IT GOES.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.976
IT'S REHEARSAL.
IT'S EXPLORATORY.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.845
SO DO YOU
WANT SOME POPCORN?
I MADE IT.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.915
( both chuckling )

14:08.015 --> 14:11.284
THIS IS LIKE THE GREATEST
RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER SEEN
YOU HAVE ON THE SHOW.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.120
I KNOW, GEORGE HAS NEVER
BEEN THIS HAPPY.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.322
I'M WATCHING RICHARD BENJAMIN
AND PAULA PRENTISS HERE.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.091
- THIS IS FANTASTIC.
- SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.526
- Jerry: I REALLY BELIEVE THIS.
- Cheryl: THANK YOU.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.394
OKAY, THAT'S LUNCH
FOR A HALF.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.596
WE'RE FEEDING ON 19.
WE'RE RIGHT BACK HERE
AFTER LUNCH.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.066
- WHAT DO WE GOT,
LIKE A HALF HOUR?
- TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.001
- THAT IS GOLD.
- YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME LUNCH?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.536
DON'T CHANGE
ANYTHING THOUGH.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.371
- LAR. HEY, LAR.
- ONE SECOND.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.240
- NO, LAR, WAIT A SECOND.
- HOW YOU DOING?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.408
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE GOT TO GET GOING.
- ONE SECOND.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.410
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO PICK UP THOSE BEANS?
I'M REALLY LOW ON COFFEE.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.580
YOU KNOW, I WENT
AND THERE WAS A LOT
OF TRAFFIC.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.116
I GOT STUCK IN TRAFFIC
AND BY THE TIME I GOT THERE--

14:43.216 --> 14:45.585
I WENT ALL THE WAY OVER THERE,
THE STORE WAS CLOSED

14:45.685 --> 14:47.187
SO I COULDN'T GET 'EM.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.089
SO YOU DIDN'T
GET THE BEANS?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.058
NO, I DIDN'T
GET THE BEANS.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.659
SO YOU DIDN'T
DO ME THE FAVOR?

14:52.759 --> 14:54.527
I ATTEMPTED
TO DO YOU THE FAVOR.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.829
I TRIED TO DO YOU THE FAVOR.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:56.930 --> 14:58.598
- AN ATTEMPT IS NOT A FAVOR.
- WHAT?

14:58.698 --> 15:01.568
IT IS A FAVOR.
IT IS A FAVOR.
THAT'S AS GOOD AS A FAVOR.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.071
- THE EFFORT WAS THERE.
- WHAT DID YOU COME BACK
WITH, THOUGH?

15:04.171 --> 15:05.705
WELL, THE STORE
WAS CLOSED.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.774
DRIVING TO A COFFEE PLACE
IS NOT A FAVOR.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.176
WHERE DID I BRING
THE JUMPER CABLES,

15:09.276 --> 15:11.244
HALFWAY TO YOUR OFFICE
OR TO YOUR OFFICE?

15:11.344 --> 15:14.681
MOCHA JOE HAS NOTHING TO SHOW
FOR YOUR SUPPOSED FAVOR.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.616
- I KNOW.
- YOU HAVE JUMPER CABLES.
WHAT DOES HE GOT?

15:16.716 --> 15:19.486
- EXACTLY.
- HE'S GOT A GUY WHO HAS
A STORY ABOUT TRAFFIC.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.254
- THANK YOU, JERRY.
- YOU'RE WELCOME, MOCHA JOE.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.023
COME ON, I DID A LOT
FOR MOCHA JOE.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.824
MOCHA JOE DOESN'T NEED PEOPLE
DRIVING AROUND FOR HIM.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.360
- HE NEEDS COFFEE.
- WHATEVER HAPPENED TO
E FOR EFFORT, JERRY?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.896
E FOR EFFORT!
YOU PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.699
E FOR EFFORT!

15:32.799 --> 15:34.767
F FOR FAVOR!

15:34.867 --> 15:36.669
C FOR COFFEE.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.640
Larry:
AND BY THE TIME I GOT
OUTSIDE THEY WENT TO LUNCH

15:40.740 --> 15:43.343
IN HIS CAR WITH
THE TINTED WINDOWS.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.712
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THOSE TINTED WINDOWS?

15:45.812 --> 15:47.114
ANYTHING COULD BE
GOING ON IN THAT CAR.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.415
THEY COULD BE
EATING BURRITOS

15:48.515 --> 15:50.483
BEHIND THOSE TINTED
WINDOWS AT LUNCH.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.986
THAT'S YOUR PROOF?
THEY'VE GOT TINTED WINDOWS?

15:53.086 --> 15:55.288
IT'S NOT ONLY THAT.
I TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED
ON STAGE.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.024
THE WAY THEY WERE GETTING
ALONG AND LAUGHING

15:57.124 --> 15:58.358
AND THE TOUCHING
AND ALL THAT.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.094
AND LAST NIGHT
HE WAS AT HER HOUSE.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.596
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU SOUND CRAZY.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.299
YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM.
IF YOU HAD SEEN THEM
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.036
I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUST LET THIS BLOW OVER.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.904
THIS IS NOTHING.
AND JUST GO BACK TO WORK.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.541
COME ON.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.608
ALL RIGHT.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.410
OH.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.148
- HMM.
- WHAT?

16:21.248 --> 16:23.316
YOU GOT A RING STAIN
ON YOUR TABLE.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.085
- REALLY?
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.554
WHAT?
WHAT'S INTERESTING
ABOUT A RING STAIN?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.956
WAIT A SECOND.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.992
- YEAH?
- I REMEMBER SUSIE

16:33.093 --> 16:35.295
HAD A DRINK
AT THE PARTY.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.431
SHE WAS STANDING
RIGHT BY THAT TABLE.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.367
- HEY, JEFF.
- YEAH?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.935
OH, HI, LAR.
JEFF, DID YOU CALL
THE SPRINKLER GUY?

16:43.036 --> 16:45.038
- BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING.
- NOT YET.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.873
- YOU TOLD ME 10 MINUTES AGO.
- HEY.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.309
- I'LL CALL HIM.
- WHAT?

16:49.409 --> 16:51.144
I NOTICE YOU GOT A LITTLE
RING STAIN ON YOUR TABLE.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.945
I KNOW.
I NOTICED THAT.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.582
- HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.650
- NO IDEA?
- NO.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.487
DO YOU RESPECT WOOD, SUSIE?

17:01.921 --> 17:05.058
UH, YES, I DO
RESPECT WOOD. WHY?

17:05.158 --> 17:08.128
YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED
A CONSISTENT LACK OR RESPECT
FOR WOOD AS I SEE IT.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.197
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.498
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GETTING AT.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.234
- I SEE A RING STAIN
ON YOUR TABLE.
- YEAH.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.604
I REMEMBER YOU STANDING
OVER JULIA'S ANTIQUE
TABLE WITH A DRINK.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.707
- YEAH, THEREFORE?
- OKAY? I'M PUTTING TWO
AND TWO TOGETHER.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.343
I THINK YOU LEFT THAT RING
STAIN ON JULIA'S TABLE.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.212
SO DON'T TELL ME
YOU RESPECT WOOD.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.979
OH, I RESPECT WOOD, LARRY.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.715
I RESPECT WOOD SO MUCH

17:28.815 --> 17:31.451
THAT IF I HAD A PIECE
OF WOOD IN MY HAND RIGHT NOW

17:31.551 --> 17:33.353
I'D BEAT THE SHIT OUT
OF YOU WITH IT, OKAY?

17:33.453 --> 17:36.256
- MMM.
- GET THE FUCK OUT
OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

17:36.356 --> 17:38.091
OKAY.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.630
- WHAT IS HE DOING, JEFF?
- I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.032
WHAT ARE YOU--
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FUCKING
RING STAINS ON MY--

17:46.133 --> 17:48.168
DON'T TOUCH MY BOOKS!
GET OUT!

17:48.268 --> 17:50.203
GET THE FUCK OUT!

17:50.303 --> 17:53.273
CALL THE SPRINKLER GUY!

18:07.086 --> 18:10.457
OH, JEEZ.
IT'S BRIGHT OUT HERE.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.128
- HEY.
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR WINDOWS?

18:15.228 --> 18:16.763
I GOT THEM TINTED.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.166
- JASON'S GUY
GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL.
- OH, HIS GUY?

18:19.266 --> 18:20.633
- YEAH.
- REALLY?

18:20.733 --> 18:23.270
I'M TELLING YOU, IT MAKES
A BIG DIFFERENCE WITH THE SUN.

18:23.370 --> 18:26.038
- IT'S SO BRIGHT.
- WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER NIGHT?

18:26.139 --> 18:27.174
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:27.274 --> 18:29.476
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO COME OVER.

18:29.576 --> 18:33.079
YOU TOLD ME NOT
TO COME AND YOU WOUND
UP WORKING WITH JASON.

18:33.180 --> 18:37.450
WELL, YOU SAID YOU WERE
BUSY WITH YOUR BEANS,

18:37.550 --> 18:39.118
- DOING SOMETHING
FOR MOCHA JOE.
- BUSY WITH MY BEANS?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.920
I WASN'T BUSY
WITH ANY BEANS.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.122
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
ON THE PHONE-- YOU WERE
DOING SOMETHING WITH BEANS.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.658
I WAS PICKING BEANS UP.
I WASN'T BUSY WITH THEM.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.126
THAT'S BUSY.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.429
I SAID THE PHRASE
BUSY WITH BEANS?
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.864
YOU SAID BEANS
AND CLEARLY YOU WERE BUSY.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.733
SO YOU COULD NOT
COME OVER TO MY HOUSE.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.503
YOU WANT TO THINK
I WAS BUSY WITH BEANS,
GO AHEAD AND THINK THAT.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.405
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAID ON THE PHONE.
WHY WOULD I MAKE UP BEANS?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.173
SO WHAT WAS JASON
DOING AT YOUR HOUSE?

19:00.273 --> 19:02.942
- I'M JUST CURIOUS.
- I NEED TO GET GOING.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.412
- YOU'RE BEING WEIRD.
- I'M NOT BEING WEIRD.
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.046
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW HE WOUND UP THERE.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.781
DID HE CALL YOU?
DID YOU CALL HIM?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.883
I'M CURIOUS.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.453
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT,
MOCHA JOE.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.988
- WHAT'S ALL MY FAULT?
- EVERYTHING.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.425
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU BUSIED ME WITH YOUR BEANS.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.826
I'M NOT GONNA FORGET THIS,
MOCHA JOE.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.261
YOU STILL OWE ME
A FAVOR, LARRY.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.995
YEAH, I'LL BRING YOU
BREAKFAST IN BED TOMORROW.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.532
YEAH, GOOD.
I'LL BE HUNGRY.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.239
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
YOU AND THE THERAPIST SAYS

19:32.339 --> 19:34.241
THAT MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER SIDE TO YOU.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.043
YEAH, NOT JUST ONE.
DOZENS.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.645
( chuckles )

19:38.745 --> 19:40.813
SHOULD WE SIT DOWN?

19:40.913 --> 19:43.149
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.653
I, UH--
I MADE SOME POPCORN.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.224
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE AN IDEA.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.860
I THINK WE SHOULD
CHANGE THE BLOCKING.
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.295
- OKAY.
- COME HERE.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.397
- I WANT YOU
TO SIT OVER HERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.999
- JASON, SIT ON THE ARM.
- Larry: I HAVE AN IDEA.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.469
I WANT YOU OVER HERE
ON THE STOOL.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.371
- OKAY?
- Jerry: OVER THERE?

20:04.471 --> 20:06.239
- YEAH.
- WE HAVE THE WHOLE
POPCORN THING.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.040
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET THE STOOL.
COME HERE.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.742
- I GOT A BETTER IDEA.
- LAR.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.711
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
YEAH, COME HERE.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.813
- GO IN HERE.
- Jerry: WHAT'S HE GONNA
DO IN THERE?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.582
YOU STAY HERE.
YOU'RE GONNA DO
THE SCENE IN THERE.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.117
- HE'S GOT TO BE NEXT TO HER.
- THAT'S FUNNY.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.052
- THIS IS GONNA BE FUNNY.
- NO.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.121
I WANT TO SEE
THEM GET TOGETHER.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.324
- Jason: JERRY?
- NO NO NO.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.560
- IS THIS WORKING FOR YOU?
- THIS IS GONNA BE FUNNY.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.196
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT
THIS FOR A SECOND?
I THINK, UM--

20:30.297 --> 20:32.399
CAN WE JUST--
THAT'S A FIVE.

20:32.499 --> 20:35.668
DID YOU GET THAT?
I THOUGHT THIS WAS WORKING.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.772
I DON'T GET THIS IDEA.
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY
SENSE AT ALL.

20:39.872 --> 20:43.776
WHY? IT'S KIND OF QUIRKY
THAT HE'S SAYING THIS STUFF
FROM THE BATHROOM.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.378
WHO ELSE WOULD DO THAT?

20:45.478 --> 20:48.214
THE BATHROOM?
WHAT IS GOING--

20:48.315 --> 20:50.783
- SOMETHING'S UP HERE.
- NO.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.985
HOW MANY YEARS
DID WE WORK TOGETHER?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.087
WE WOULD GET SO TIRED,

20:55.187 --> 20:57.223
WE SPENT SO MANY
HOURS TOGETHER.

20:57.324 --> 21:00.893
WE WOULD DIVULGE THE MOST
INTIMATE DETAILS OF OUR
PERSONAL LIVES, RIGHT?

21:00.993 --> 21:03.296
- RIGHT.
- LIKE TWINS IN
A WOMB, RIGHT?

21:03.396 --> 21:05.332
- THAT'S HOW WE DID THIS SHOW.
- RIGHT.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.435
SO WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU CAN TELL ME.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.837
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.705
YOU'RE SURE?

21:12.805 --> 21:14.073
YEAH.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.476
COMPLETELY SURE?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.711
YEAH.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.726
ALL RIGHT.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.734
Man:
THAT'S LUNCH.
ONE HOUR.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.571
HEY, LET'S GO TO THAT THAI
JOINT WE USED TO GO TO.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.739
REMEMBER YOU USED TO GET THAT
PAD THAI WITH THE NOODLES?

21:46.839 --> 21:49.008
- YEAH, I CAN'T
DO IT RIGHT NOW.
- COME ON.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.878
- MAYBE WE'LL DO IT TOMORROW.
- THE PEANUT SAUCE.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.980
WHERE'S CHERYL?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.815
SHE LEFT WITH JASON.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.191
HEY, DID YOU SEE CHERYL?

22:05.291 --> 22:07.093
SHE WENT THAT WAY.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.916
CHERYL!
AHA!

22:30.016 --> 22:32.419
- ( barking )
- NO!

22:32.519 --> 22:34.120
- MOCHA JOE!
- ( screams )

22:34.220 --> 22:36.689
- ( barking )
- MOCHA JOE!

22:36.789 --> 22:38.558
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
OH SHIT!

22:38.658 --> 22:40.059
OH NO!
OW! OH NO!

22:40.159 --> 22:43.630
OH, MOCHA JOE!
MOCHA JOE!

22:45.832 --> 22:49.335
THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY
THE DOGS NOW BECAUSE
MOCHA JOE WAS BITTEN.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.370
- REALLY?
- YES.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.306
- HUH.
- YOU HAVE GOT TO
TALK TO HIM

22:54.407 --> 22:56.576
AND ASK HIM TO JUST
DROP THE CHARGES.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.010
THEY'RE JASON'S DOGS.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.880
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT HE'S GOT
SOME KILLER DOGS IN THERE.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.816
WHY ARE YOU GOING THROUGH
HIS CAR, BY THE WAY?

23:03.916 --> 23:05.418
ISN'T THAT
A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS?

23:05.518 --> 23:08.455
WELL, I'M THINKING ABOUT
BUYING ONE OF THOSE

23:08.555 --> 23:10.590
AND I WANTED TO CHECK OUT
THE HEADROOM.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.391
THEN YOU GO TO A SHOWROOM.
GO TO A CAR DEALER

23:12.492 --> 23:13.860
AND CHECK IT OUT.
TALK TO A SALESMAN.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.129
LOOK, THE POINT IS
YOU CAN'T LET THE DOGS DIE.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.865
- YOU JUST CAN'T.
- REALLY?

23:18.965 --> 23:21.734
YES, BECAUSE JASON
WILL BE A BASKETCASE

23:21.834 --> 23:23.302
AND WE HAVE A SHOW
IN THREE DAYS.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.938
OKAY FINE,
I'LL GO TALK TO MOCHA JOE.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.174
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.709
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.278
I'M GONNA START TO WORK
ON THIS A SCENE.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.781
SEE IF WE CAN GET
A BETTER OPENING.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.352
WHAT IS THIS?

23:40.453 --> 23:43.222
LOOKS LIKE A STAIN
FROM COFFEE.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.124
REALLY?

23:45.224 --> 23:48.495
YEAH, I GOT A RING
STAIN FROM SOME COFFEE.
I PUT SOME COFFEE THERE.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.963
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

23:53.332 --> 23:56.102
DID YOU LEAVE A RING STAIN ON
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS'S TABLE?

23:56.202 --> 23:57.303
OH NO.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

23:57.403 --> 23:58.938
HOW DID THIS GET HERE?

23:59.038 --> 24:01.173
THAT'S BETWEEN
THE COFFEE AND THE WOOD.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.543
- NO, YOU DON'T RESPECT WOOD.
- I DO RESPECT WOOD.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.311
THIS IS A LOW-GRADE WOOD.

24:05.411 --> 24:07.547
OH, SO YOU DISCRIMINATE
AMONGST WOOD?

24:07.647 --> 24:09.982
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.619
I RESPECT ALL WOOD.
I RESPECT PINE.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.187
I RESPECT WALNUT.
I RESPECT OAK.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.356
DOESN'T MATTER, OKAY?
YOU DON'T.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.091
AND WHAT ABOUT THE DOGS?
NO RESPECT FOR THE DOGS?

24:19.191 --> 24:21.193
YOUR HEART BLEEDS
FOR THE WOOD

24:21.293 --> 24:24.130
BUT NOT FOR ACTUAL LIFE.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.500
SO YOU GO TO A FUNERAL,
YOU'RE MORE UPSET ABOUT THE
COFFIN THAN THE DECEASED?

24:27.600 --> 24:30.670
DID YOU LEAVE THAT STAIN
ON HER COFFEE TABLE, JERRY?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.705
YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.641
OKAY.

24:34.741 --> 24:37.810
I'M NOT DONE WITH
THAT RING STAIN SO FAST.

24:37.910 --> 24:41.648
OH, LARRY DAVID,
WOOD DETECTIVE.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.518
- THANKS, MOCHA JOE.
- THANKS, BUDDY.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.223
- HI, MOCHA JOE.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, LARRY?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.425
THE THING IS,
MOCHA JOE,

24:53.526 --> 24:55.427
IF YOU PRESS CHARGES

24:55.528 --> 24:59.165
THOSE DOGS ARE GONNA
GET PUT DOWN.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.568
THAT'S RIGHT, LARRY.
THOSE DOGS ARE GETTING GASSED.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.771
I'D DO IT MYSELF IF I COULD.
AND I'D HAVE IT TELEVISED.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.939
WELL...

25:07.039 --> 25:09.809
THEN MAYBE YOU
COULD DO ME A...

25:09.909 --> 25:12.178
SOLID.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.880
A SOLID, LARRY?

25:13.980 --> 25:17.283
IS THERE LIKE ANOTHER
WORD FOR SOLID?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.588
- FAV...
- I CAN'T HEAR.
WHAT, LARRY?

25:24.624 --> 25:27.727
- FAVOR.
- DID YOU SAY FAVOR, LARRY?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.230
DOES THIS FAVOR
INVOLVE A TIP?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.068
OKAY, MOCHA JOE.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.304
I GUESS IT DOES.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.710
THAT'S FOR ME
BRINGING THE JUMPER
CABLES TO YOUR OFFICE.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.511
- OH, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.280
- 'CAUSE I KNOW HOW
DIFFICULT THAT WAS FOR YOU.
- IT WAS.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.117
- IT WAS HARD WORK.
- LONG WALK.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.053
THAT'S FOR NOT PICKING UP
MY FUCKING COFFEE BEANS.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.989
I WENT DOWN THERE,
BUT THE STORE WAS CLOSED.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.658
NOT MY FAULT.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.729
ONE DOG LIVES.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.264
HEY, I'M HERE TO PICK UP THAT
COFFEE FOR JASON ALEXANDER.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.500
RIGHT, A BLACK COFFEE NO SUGAR
AND ONE VANILLA DECAF LATTE.

26:08.601 --> 26:10.737
- GREAT. THANKS SO MUCH.
- VANILLA DECAF LATTE?

26:10.837 --> 26:13.472
- YEAH, A VANILLA DECAF LATTE.
- ALL RIGHT.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.342
THE DOGS, OKAY?
ARE WE GOOD?

26:16.442 --> 26:18.210
STAY OF EXECUTION.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.213
HOW YOU DOING, LADIES?

26:25.718 --> 26:27.854
( knocks )

26:27.954 --> 26:30.356
- HEY.
- HEY, COFFEE TIME.
A LITTLE CAFFEINE.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.491
- YES.
- THANK YOU, I WILL GET
IT WHERE IT'S GOING.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.593
- ENJOY.
- ALL RIGHT.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.400
HEY, CHERYL,
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.069
CHERYL, OPEN UP.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.271
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHERE IS HE?

26:45.371 --> 26:47.273
- WHAT?
- HUH? WHERE IS HE?

26:47.373 --> 26:49.942
LARRY, HEY!

26:50.042 --> 26:52.979
THAT'S RIGHT!
I SEE YOU!

26:53.079 --> 26:56.048
- LAUGHING AT LAR?
- LARRY!

26:56.148 --> 26:58.150
SCAMPERING AND SCURRYING,
I SEE YOU!

26:58.250 --> 26:59.719
LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:59.819 --> 27:01.888
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:01.988 --> 27:04.223
- WHAT'S GOING IN HERE?
- NOTHING.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.726
SOMETHING IS GOING ON,
OTHERWISE HE WOULDN'T
BE RUNNING AWAY.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.995
WELL, YOU'RE
INTIMIDATING HIM.

27:09.095 --> 27:12.598
- REALLY?
- YEAH, HE'S VERY SENSITIVE,
BY THE WAY.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.033
- OH, IS HE?
- YES.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.135
- JASON'S SENSITIVE?
- HE'S SENSITIVE.

27:16.235 --> 27:19.071
HE'S FUNNY.
HE'S A LITTLE NEUROTIC,
SO THINGS LIKE THIS

27:19.171 --> 27:20.807
- CAN GET UNDER HIS SKIN.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

27:20.907 --> 27:22.942
- THAT'S GEORGE.
THAT'S NOT JASON.
- THAT'S JASON.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.144
THAT'S GEORGE.
THAT'S ALL GEORGE.
THAT'S ME.

27:25.244 --> 27:29.548
I WROTE THAT STUFF.
YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO HIM,
YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO ME.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.317
I'M GEORGE.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.263
DID YOU WORK
ON THIS WITH HIM?

27:44.363 --> 27:46.032
Jerry:
I DIDN'T.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.534
THIS IS LIKE A MAJOR--
HE TOOK THE WHOLE THING APART.

27:48.634 --> 27:52.138
- LAR, WHAT DID YOU DO?
- WHAT?

27:52.238 --> 27:55.808
- IT'S ALL DIFFERENT.
- I MADE SOME CHANGES.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.543
I CHANGED THE ENDING.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.311
Jerry:
YOU GOT A WHOLE NEW
SHOW HERE.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.181
SO GEORGE AND AMANDA,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
END UP TOGETHER?

28:02.281 --> 28:03.649
- NO.
- OH, COME ON.

28:03.750 --> 28:04.917
- OH MY GOD.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.753
IT WAS SO LAME.
WHO'S GONNA BUY THAT?

28:06.853 --> 28:09.088
THEY GET TOGETHER--
WE DON'T DO ENDINGS
LIKE THAT.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.490
- THAT'S WHY IT'S SO FUNNY.
- EXACTLY.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.893
IT'S ALL BULLSHIT.
WHAT COUPLES GET TOGETHER
IN THE END?

28:13.993 --> 28:16.028
- YOU KNOW IT'S FANTASY CRAP.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

28:16.128 --> 28:19.031
LARRY, WE ALREADY
SCREWED UP ONE FINALE.
WE CAN'T DO ANOTHER.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.901
WE DIDN'T SCREW UP A FINALE.
THAT WAS A GOOD FINALE.

28:22.001 --> 28:25.171
- LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
- LARRY, THIS CHANGES
THE WHOLE THING.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.439
I WAS VERY INVESTED
IN THAT STORY.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.976
THAT STORY HAD A GREAT ENDING.
THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.611
WELL, THIS IS THE SHOW.
THIS IS THE SHOW.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.815
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.717
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M SORRY, GUYS, I CAN'T.
- JASON, COME ON.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.519
NO, JASON.
YOU'RE NOT WRONG,
BUT WE CAN'T.

28:40.619 --> 28:44.556
LARRY, DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
I QUIT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.592
- JASON.
- I'M SORRY, MIKE.

28:46.692 --> 28:49.595
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO IT.
- THIS IS WORKING OUT GREAT.

28:49.695 --> 28:53.165
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
SO HOW DO WE DO THE SHOW
WITHOUT JASON?

28:53.265 --> 28:56.402
IT'S JUST A SCRIPT, LARRY.
THERE'S NO SHOW WITHOUT JASON.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.905
HOW DO YOU EVEN HAVE THE SHOW?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

28:59.005 --> 29:01.540
YOU HAVE A THREE-LEGGED
GOAT HERE.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.209
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING?

29:03.309 --> 29:05.044
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.446
LARRY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

29:09.348 --> 29:12.084
I'LL PLAY GEORGE.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.486
- WHAT?
- I'LL PLAY GEORGE.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.989
- I'LL PLAY GEORGE.
- WHAT?

29:17.089 --> 29:19.058
- YES, I CAN DO IT.
- ( laughing )

29:19.158 --> 29:20.592
YOU'LL PLAY WHAT,
GEORGE'S BUTLER?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:20.692 --> 29:23.362
NO, I WILL PLAY
GEORGE COSTANZA.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.932
I CAN DO IT.
I KNOW I CAN.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.767
I WROTE IT.
THE CHARACTER
IS BASED ON ME.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.937
THERE WERE TWO DARRENS
ON "BEWITCHED."

29:31.037 --> 29:32.704
NOBODY LIKED
THAT SECOND DARREN.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.506
- I DIDN'T CARE
FOR THE SECOND DARREN.
- BUT YOU BOUGHT IT.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.376
- OH MY GOD.
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS IS?

29:37.476 --> 29:40.079
IT'S ICONIC
TELEVISION HERE.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.581
THE SET'S AN ICON.
HE'S AN ICON.

29:42.681 --> 29:45.251
SHE'S AN ICON.
HE WAS AN ICON.

29:45.351 --> 29:48.687
ICON.
NO-CON.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.290
THERE'S NO JOHN, PAUL,
GEORGE AND LARRY.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.560
IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.395
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

29:56.495 --> 29:59.665
WELL, SOMEBODY'S GONNA
HAVE TO GO GET JASON.

29:59.765 --> 30:02.368
LET ME TRY IT.
LET ME TRY IT.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.471
LET ME DO ONE SCENE.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

30:09.842 --> 30:11.477
ACTION!

30:11.577 --> 30:13.712
SO I'M IN A BANK
THE OTHER DAY.
I'M ON THE LINE

30:13.812 --> 30:16.648
AND THE GUY IN FRONT
OF ME IS LEAVING A SPACE
IN FRONT OF HIM.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.717
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T TAKE THAT.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.920
- NO, YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT.
- I'M THINKING, "COME ON,
TIGHTEN IT UP, DUDE.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.188
- TIGHTEN IT UP."
- RIGHT.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.789
SO THEN--

30:23.890 --> 30:26.025
OH, YOU'RE GONNA DO
THE BLACKBERRY-HEAD-DOWN
THING ON ME NOW?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.194
WHAT IS WITH
THE BLACKBERRY PEOPLE?

30:28.294 --> 30:30.529
CAN I JUST PICK UP A MAGAZINE,
HOLD IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE

30:30.629 --> 30:32.932
AND READ IT
WHILE YOU'RE TALKING?
IS THAT OKAY TOO?

30:33.032 --> 30:36.102
WAIT, WHAT MAGAZINE?

30:39.872 --> 30:42.808
HEY, GEORGE.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.843
ARE YOU HAPPY?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.745
- WHAT?
- HUH?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.614
I WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE HAPPY.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.149
YEAH, I'M REASONABLY
HAPPY.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.618
YOU HAD TO INTERFERE,
DIDN'T YOU?

30:52.718 --> 30:54.353
GEORGE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:54.453 --> 30:56.722
KRAMER AND I WERE ALL SET
TO DO THIS FAKE MUGGING

30:56.822 --> 30:59.325
AND YOU HAD TO PUT ALL THESE
IDEAS IN HIS HEAD THAT HE WAS
DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.661
GEORGE, WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER
JUST TO TALK TO AMANDA?

31:02.761 --> 31:05.397
NO. NO.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.867
NO. HO-HO.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.103
GEORGE IS GETTING UPSET.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.312
HUH? HUH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:23.049 --> 31:25.952
YEAH, I JUST QUIT.
I DID.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.020
I TRIED TO DO GEORGE
AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.856
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET THEM DO THEIR STUPID
ENDING WITH JASON.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.825
HE'S ALREADY ON HIS
WAY BACK HERE.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.962
I DON'T CARE.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.030
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:38.130 --> 31:40.799
THE ONLY REASON I DID THIS
WHOLE THING WAS TO BE WITH HER,

31:40.899 --> 31:44.203
TO WORK WITH HER,
TO GET HER BACK.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.973
BUT IF I CAN'T HAVE HER,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

31:48.107 --> 31:50.776
I DON'T CARE.
I'M-- I'M DONE.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.045
I'M QUITTING.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.852
But man wants to make
his woman happy.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.554
Wants to do it.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.090
Doesn't know how
to do it.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.657
( audience laughs )

32:05.757 --> 32:08.194
Sometimes we do it,
don't know how we did it.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.296
Can't ask, "What did I do?"

32:10.396 --> 32:12.398
Looks like you don't know
what you're doing.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.133
Can't do nothing.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.002
Woman says, "I can't believe
you're doing this."

32:16.102 --> 32:18.304
Man says, "Doing what?"
Woman starts crying.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.806
Man says,
"I didn't do anything."

32:20.906 --> 32:23.109
Woman says, "Exactly."

32:25.444 --> 32:28.047
It's an unwritten rule
of etiquette, George.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.416
- Who says so?
- No one knows.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.319
THAT'S WHY IT'S UNWRITTEN.
YOU DO NOT BLOW YOUR NOSE

32:33.419 --> 32:35.721
INTO A CLOTH NAPKIN
IN A RESTAURANT.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.889
WHY?
THEY WASH IT.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.959
IT'S JUST NOT DONE
IN POLITE SOCIETY.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.861
IT'S NOT DONE
IN IMPOLITE SOCIETY.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.331
EVEN THE IMPOLITE
DON'T DO IT.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.966
THE OTHER DAY
YOU SNEEZED INTO A NAPKIN.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.468
- THAT'S DIFFERENT.
- HOW?

32:49.568 --> 32:51.370
A SNEEZE IS INVOLUNTARY.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.740
YOU HAVE 2.5 SECONDS
BEFORE THAT BOMB GOES OFF.

32:56.408 --> 32:59.211
WELL, I LIVE BY MY RULES.
I DON'T LIVE BY YOUR RULES.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.114
- DID YOU DO THIS
IN FRONT OF YOUR WIFE?
- ALL THE TIME.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.316
CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHY SHE LEFT YOU.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.885
- ( door buzzes )
- YEAH?

33:06.985 --> 33:08.587
- It's Elaine.
- COME ON UP.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.689
HEY, GEORGE.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.391
DID YOU SEE THIS?

33:12.491 --> 33:15.294
- IT'S AN ARTICLE
ABOUT BERNIE MADOFF.
- KRAMER.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.530
LOOK AT THIS.
THEY GOT THE FLOOR PLAN
TO ALL HIS OFFICES.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.599
- HERE'S WHERE HE WAS.
- KRAMER, HE DOESN'T WANT--

33:20.699 --> 33:23.902
YOU COULDN'T GET TO HIM.
IT WAS A PONZI SCHEME.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.871
ALL RIGHT, DO I NEED
TO HEAR THIS?

33:25.971 --> 33:27.439
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.709
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
YOU LOST A COUPLE OF MILLION.

33:30.809 --> 33:33.045
IT WAS MORE THAN A COUPLE.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.513
WELL, IT WAS MORE
THAN A GREAT IDEA.

33:34.613 --> 33:38.150
AN iPHONE APPLICATION
THAT LEADS YOU VIA YOUR G.P.S.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.219
TO THE NEAREST
ACCEPTABLE TOILET

33:40.319 --> 33:42.821
WHEREVER YOU ARE
IN THE WORLD.

33:42.921 --> 33:45.191
THE iTOILET.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.094
AND I THOUGHT OF IT.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.229
THAT WAS ONE KILLER APP.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.131
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT ALL
TO THAT CROOK MADOFF?

33:52.231 --> 33:53.565
I DON'T KNOW.

33:53.665 --> 33:56.435
HOW COULD YOU BE SO
FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE?

33:58.837 --> 34:01.540
ALL OF IT, JERRY.
ALL OF IT.

34:04.910 --> 34:07.513
- MADOFF?
- MADOFF!

34:13.051 --> 34:16.822
WELL, I'LL NEVER MEET
ANYONE ELSE AGAIN.

34:16.922 --> 34:19.024
PROBABLY NOT.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.527
- MEETING IS HARD.
- MEETING IS HARD.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.996
- WHY CAN'T YOU MEET?
- CAN'T MEET. WHY IS THAT?

34:25.097 --> 34:28.834
THIS IS WHAT SINGLE PEOPLE
ARE THINKING ABOUT THE MINUTE
THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.103
AND YET WE'RE SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.172
THEY'RE RIGHT NEXT TO US
ON THE BUS, ON THE STREET.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.207
- BUT WE CAN'T MEET THEM.
- WHY WON'T THEY MEET US?

34:35.307 --> 34:37.809
BECAUSE STRANGERS
HAVE A BAD REPUTATION.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.847
A FEW BAD STRANGERS
THAT RUINED IT FOR
THE REST OF US.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.849
IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.352
OH, AMANDA.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.455
- SHE WAS SO EASY
TO TALK TO.
- MMM.

34:49.555 --> 34:52.591
HER LIKE WILL NEVER
COME THIS WAY AGAIN.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.860
OH, HERE SHE COMES NOW.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.664
Oh!

34:58.764 --> 35:01.667
- George.
- Hey.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.335
How are you?

35:03.435 --> 35:06.905
Pretty pretty pretty
pretty pretty good.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.974
- Well, you look good.
- I am good.

35:09.074 --> 35:10.576
- I'M GOOD TOO.
- JERRY'S GOOD.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.344
- YEAH.
- GOOD.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.681
Jerry:
Why don't you take a seat?
Just having some coffee.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.783
Okay.

35:17.883 --> 35:21.086
So, what brings you here?

35:21.187 --> 35:23.689
I'm meeting someone.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.324
Dating?

35:25.424 --> 35:28.894
- Just sex.
- ( chokes )

35:28.994 --> 35:30.896
She is easy to talk to.

35:30.996 --> 35:33.565
( doorbell rings )

35:34.766 --> 35:36.635
( TV turns off )

35:43.175 --> 35:45.444
( both chuckle )

35:45.544 --> 35:48.380
WHAT'S GOING ON?
VIRGINIA'S--

35:48.480 --> 35:50.081
- DOING THE SHOW.
- VIRGINIA'S DOING THE SHOW.

35:50.182 --> 35:51.883
I KNOW.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.752
I QUIT.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.255
YOU QUIT?

35:56.355 --> 35:58.457
WELL, YOU KNOW,
VIRGINIA'S NECK GOT BETTER.

35:58.557 --> 36:01.327
SHE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PART.
SHE WAS ORIGINALLY CAST.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.695
AND I GOT IN A BIG
FIGHT WITH JASON.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.365
- YOU GOT IN A FIGHT
WITH JASON?
- YEAH, BIG FIGHT.

36:06.465 --> 36:10.101
- WHAT DID YOU FIGHT ABOUT?
- I CALLED HIS BOOK A PAMPHLET.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.471
YOU CALLED HIS BOOK
A PAMPHLET?

36:12.571 --> 36:15.374
- IT'S SO THIN.
- IT IS, IT'S VERY THIN.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.743
IT'S NOT A BOOK.
I KNOW IT'S NOT A BOOK.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.077
NO, IT'S NOT A BOOK.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.781
AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW,
AFTER YOU LEFT...

36:24.383 --> 36:27.085
IT JUST,
I DON'T KNOW.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.987
- WASN'T THE SAME?
- IT WASN'T THE SAME.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.156
I'M WATCHING THE SHOW.
COME ON IN.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.992
- I GOT YOU A COFFEE.
- YOU DID?

36:34.092 --> 36:35.861
- YEAH, IT'S A MOCHA JOE.
- MOCHA JOE?

36:35.961 --> 36:38.297
YEAH.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.301
Hey, you know what?

36:42.401 --> 36:44.002
I have to call
my mother in Florida

36:44.102 --> 36:45.537
and tell her
we're back together.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.506
This could be the news
that finally kills her.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.075
Because of the shock
or because she doesn't
like me?

36:50.175 --> 36:53.044
I'm fine either way.

36:53.144 --> 36:55.681
What do I say
if she asks me why?

36:55.781 --> 36:59.117
Tell her that sometimes you
have to be away from something

36:59.217 --> 37:01.052
to really appreciate it.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.255
That's how I feel
about Cuban food.

37:03.355 --> 37:06.458
WHEN I'M EATING IT
I DON'T REALLY LIKE IT.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.660
WHEN I'M AWAY FOR A LITTLE
WHILE I MISS IT.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.568
- Well, they're back.
- Who?

37:16.668 --> 37:18.537
George and Amanda
are getting back together.

37:18.637 --> 37:22.308
- GET OUT.
- THAT'S RECIDIVISM.

37:22.408 --> 37:25.076
IT'S THE SAME THING I SAW LAST
NIGHT ON "PRISON LOCKDOWN."

37:25.176 --> 37:27.313
GEORGE COULDN'T MAKE IT
ON THE OUTSIDE.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.648
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.883
HEY, THANKS FOR GETTING
THAT DOLL FOR ISABELLE.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.453
- WAS SHE HAPPY WITH IT?
- YEAH, SHE LIKED IT.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.555
DID SHE COMMENT ON THE FACT
THAT HER DOLL IS NOW BLACK?

37:36.655 --> 37:38.790
DIDN'T SAY A WORD EXCEPT,

37:38.890 --> 37:41.059
"TELL DADDY THANK YOU."

37:41.159 --> 37:43.762
( laughing )
DADDY.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.267
- HEY!
- HEY!

37:49.368 --> 37:51.970
- IT'S EXCITING.
- WELL DONE. WELL DONE.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.239
- WHAT?
- WHAT'S WRONG?

37:54.340 --> 37:56.107
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG.

37:56.207 --> 37:59.311
SHE WANTS ME
TO SIGN A PRE-NUP.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.013
OH, SO IN CASE
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT

38:02.113 --> 38:06.084
YOU CAN'T GET TO THE MONEY
THAT WAS YOURS TO BEGIN WITH.

38:06.184 --> 38:09.688
SEE, THAT'S ANOTHER
PONZI SCHEME.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.191
SO, GEORGE, ARE YOU MARRYING
HER FOR YOUR MONEY?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.927
- ( laughs )
- None of your business,
Elaine.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.998
All;
No!

38:20.098 --> 38:22.368
- OH, YEAH.
- THAT WAS SO GOOD.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.003
- THAT WAS GREAT.
- THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.137
IT WAS REALLY--
YEAH.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.806
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.308
THAT ENDING WAS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THE ONE THAT I WROTE,

38:30.409 --> 38:33.211
- I HAVE TO SAY.
- IT WAS.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.415
YEAH, BECAUSE THEY
BELONG TOGETHER.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.823
REALLY?

38:44.923 --> 38:46.725
DON'T YOU THINK?

38:48.059 --> 38:49.094
ARE YOU SURE?

38:49.194 --> 38:51.497
I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.805
HMM.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.943
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.845
A RING STAIN?

39:06.945 --> 39:09.415
I HAVE A BAD HABIT
OF JUST PUTTING MY DRINK
DOWN ON THE TABLE.

39:09.515 --> 39:12.584
A BAD HABIT?
YOU JUST PUT YOUR DRINK
DOWN ON THE WOOD.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.920
LOOK AT THAT STAIN YOU MADE.
THIS IS A NEW TABLE.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.989
WELL, WE'LL JUST SAND IT
OFF OR SOMETHING.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.828
DO YOU RESPECT WOOD?

39:25.964 --> 39:28.934
I... GUESS SO.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.670
YOU GUESS SO?

39:31.770 --> 39:34.139
YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU RESPECT WOOD?

39:34.239 --> 39:37.108
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.944
I GUESS I DO.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.246
OH MY GOD.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.482
YOU HAD A CUP LIKE THAT
AT JULIA'S PARTY.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.852
YOU WERE STANDING
RIGHT BY THAT TABLE.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.888
YOU LEFT THE RING STAIN
ON JULIA'S TABLE.

39:49.988 --> 39:53.224
SHE BLAMED ME
THE WHOLE TIME,
BUT IT WAS YOU.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.461
- YOU LEFT THE STAIN.
- OKAY.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.796
WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.165
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.534
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT IS NO BIG DEAL.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.571
HAVING SAID THAT,

40:05.671 --> 40:08.073
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO CALL JULIA AND TELL HER

40:08.173 --> 40:11.309
- THAT YOU LEFT
THE RING STAIN.
- I'M NOT CALLING JULIA.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.378
YEAH, JUST TELL HER
THAT YOU WERE THE ONE

40:13.479 --> 40:15.313
WHO LEFT THE STAIN
ON THE ANTIQUE TABLE.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.782
- HOLD IT ONE SECOND.
- I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.650
- YEAH, COME ON.
- I'M NOT DOING THAT.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.351
- I WANT YOU TO TALK TO HER.
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO HER.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.654
- JUST HERE, HOLD IT.
- NO, PLEASE.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.991
- LARRY.
- HEY, JULES.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.560
