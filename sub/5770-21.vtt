00:04.134 --> 00:06.223
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
REALLY CHRISTIAN.MM-HMM.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.095
BUT LET'S SAY
SOMEONE KILLED ME...NO.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.922
IN A REALLY HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE WAY.

00:09.966 --> 00:12.664

KILL THE MURDERER

00:12.708 --> 00:13.839

00:13.883 --> 00:15.928
I WOULD WANT
TO KILL THEM...MM-HMM.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.930
VERY BADLY,
BUT I WOULD NOT.GOOD, GOOD.

00:17.974 --> 00:20.324
I WOULD ULTIMATELY
TRY AND FORGIVE THEM.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.934
WHAT?YE--

00:21.978 --> 00:24.285

THE INSANE PSYCHOPATH

00:24.328 --> 00:25.808
WHO CUT ME IN HALF
WITH HIS HOOK HAND

00:25.851 --> 00:27.897
AND DUMPED BOTH HALVES
OF MY BODY IN A DUMPSTER?

00:27.940 --> 00:29.855
WHAT IS THIS, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER?

00:29.899 --> 00:32.119

00:34.512 --> 00:36.079
AND, BY THE WAY,
HE DIDN'T JUST KILL ME.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.516
HE KILLED OUR TWO BEAUTIFUL
MIXED-RACE CHILDREN.

CUT HIM INTO
100,000 PIECES

00:49.962 --> 00:51.877
AND FEDEX HIM

THANKS FOR SAYING IT.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.191
[whispers]
I WOULDN'T REALLY DO IT, GOD.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.019
ARE YOU TALKING TO GOD
BEHIND MY BACK?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.500
MM-MM.
I'M SLEEPING.WHATEVER.

01:05.543 --> 01:09.112

HOLD ON ONE SECOND.WHAT?

01:11.419 --> 01:12.724
WHAT'S THAT, GOD?

01:12.768 --> 01:16.902
I SHOULD NOT KNOW CASEY
AS A MAN TONIGHT?

01:16.946 --> 01:18.687
HE IS NOT SAYING THAT.HE IS SAYING THAT.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.167
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON
THAT TALKS TO GOD.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.343
HE SHOULD
KNOW HIMSELF TONIGHT...

01:22.386 --> 01:23.866
OKAY.ON HIS SIDE OF THE BED.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.215
ALL RIGHT.ALL RIGHT.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.130
THANKS, GOD.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.219

02:02.992 --> 02:04.907
DR. REED, YOU ARE GONNA KILL
AT THAT CONFERENCE.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.038
I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT

02:06.082 --> 02:07.910
WITHOUT MORGAN'S
A/V EXPERTISE.

02:07.953 --> 02:10.217
NAH, I'M NOT AN EXPERT.I'LL GET IT.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.914
I DID WORK THE LIGHT BOARD
FOR THE OTISVILLE PRODUCTION

02:11.957 --> 02:13.133
OF WEST SIDE STORY,
IN WHICH WE USED

02:13.176 --> 02:14.917
ACTUAL RIVAL GANGS.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.701
IT NEVER OPENED,
SIX DEAD.

02:16.745 --> 02:19.008
SANTA HE-EY!

02:19.051 --> 02:20.444
SORRY.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.229
[Danny] YOU'RE SERIOUSLY CHECKING IN A BAG?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.534
WE'RE GOING AWAY
FOR TWO DAYS.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.710
RELAX, DANNY.
THIS IS A CARRY-ON.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.060
OKAY, THERE'S NO WAY THAT
THAT MONSTROSITY

02:28.104 --> 02:30.976
ADHERES TO STANDARD
CARRY-ON REGULATIONS.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.413
HAVE YOU SEEN
UP IN THE AIR? YEAH.

02:32.456 --> 02:33.675
HAVE YOU SEEN IT

02:34.763 --> 02:36.112
A STEFANI GERMANOTTA

02:36.156 --> 02:39.159
SHE'S INTERESTED
IN BECOMING A NEW PATIENT.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.903
MISS GAGA, IT IS AN HONOR
TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.427
WE'VE ACTUALLY MET BEFORE.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.690
I WAS ESCORTED OFF YOUR STAGE
AT THE NASSAU COLISEUM.

02:48.733 --> 02:49.995
IT'S NOT LADY GAGA.
IT'S JOSH.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.606
DON'T HANG UP.OH, GOD.
I'M HANGING UP.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.608
I'M SORRY. IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I KNEW YOU'D PICK UP.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.479
YOU SOUND REALLY PRETTY,
LIKE YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.916
OKAY, DO NOT FLATTER ME,
OR INSULT ME,

02:57.960 --> 02:59.266
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING.
GOOD-BYE.

02:59.309 --> 03:02.007
NO WAIT. I-I KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO NEW MEXICO TONIGHT.

03:02.051 --> 03:03.705
UGH. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT,

03:03.748 --> 03:05.272
WELL, I SAW YOUR TWEET.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.709

#BIG FAN."

03:11.016 --> 03:12.844
MY TWITTER IS NOT
FOR CHEATING EX-BOYFRIENDS.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.890
MY TWITTER
IS FOR FRIENDS,

03:14.933 --> 03:16.457
IT IS FOR PATIENTS,
AND IT IS FOR WENDY'S

03:16.500 --> 03:17.806
TO GIVE ME A SHOUT-OUT
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.374
IT'S JUST THAT I'M LIVING
NEAR SANTA FE RIGHT NOW,

03:20.417 --> 03:21.766
AND I THOUGHT
WE COULD MEET UP.COOL.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.464
NO. NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.814
I FEEL REALLY, REALLY BAD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

03:25.857 --> 03:27.294
AND I WANNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.599
OH, WELL, I WANNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

03:28.643 --> 03:30.035
BUT MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
WAS TO STOP

03:30.079 --> 03:31.559
CALLING PEOPLE DICKS
AT WORK.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.604
YEAH, I GET IT, BUT I'M GONNA
TEXT YOU THE ADDRESS ANYWAY,

03:33.648 --> 03:35.171
IN CASE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.IT'S A WASTE
OF YOUR TIME.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.260
BUT I'LL TEXT IT ANYWAY.SAVE YOUR FINGER STRENGTH.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.827
ALREADY SENT IT.ALREADY DELETED IT.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.176
MINDY?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.745
[deep breath,
phone chimes]

03:43.788 --> 03:45.790
I GET POCKETS OF FOOD
STUCK IN,

03:45.834 --> 03:47.314
SO I ALWAYS CARRY FLOSS. [Casey]
COOL.
I'LL PRAY FOR YOU.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.445
IS MINDY--HI.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.751
HEY, BABE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:49.794 --> 03:51.187
GOD DIDN'T TELL YOU
THAT I WAS ON THE PHONE

03:51.231 --> 03:52.536
WITH MY EX-BOYFRIEND,
DID HE?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.929
NO, IT DOESN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.452
YOU FORGOT YOUR GARMENT BAG.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.237
OH, OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.587
YOU'RE BRINGING A SUITCASE
AND A GARMENT BAG?

03:59.630 --> 04:01.241
YES, MY SUITCASE
IS MY CARRY-ON

04:01.284 --> 04:03.808
AND MY GARMENT BAG
IS MY PERSONAL ITEM/PURSE.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.201
WHEN BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FLIES,

04:05.245 --> 04:06.768
HE GETS A FIRST-CLASS TICKET
FOR HIS GUITAR.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.073
HE SITS IN COACH.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.424
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

04:10.467 --> 04:11.425
MINDY, YOU WERE
JUST ON THE PHONE

04:11.468 --> 04:13.775
WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.561
SO JOSH CALLED ME,

04:17.605 --> 04:19.911
AND HE WANTED ME
TO COME VISIT HIM

04:19.955 --> 04:21.348
WHEN I GO TO SANTA FE.OKAY.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.566
WHICH I'M OBVIOUSLY
NOT GONNA DO,

04:22.610 --> 04:23.611
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:23.654 --> 04:25.090
HE CAN APOLOGIZE TO ME
IN HELL.

04:25.134 --> 04:27.615
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO HELL?I LOVE GOSSIP,

04:27.658 --> 04:29.443
AND I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.444
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA
SEND YOU TO HELL.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.532
THANK YOU.I DON'T KNOW.

04:31.575 --> 04:32.794
I THINK YOU SHOULD
SEE HIM.WHAT?

04:32.837 --> 04:34.970
REALLY? WHY?CLOSURE.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.145
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANNA

04:36.188 --> 04:37.451
SPEND YEARS OF YOUR LIFE
HATING SOMEBODY.

04:37.494 --> 04:38.843
OH, CASEY,
I AGREE WITH YOU.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.018
OH, I DON'T HATE ANYBODY--

04:40.062 --> 04:41.411
NO. YOU KNOW
WHO I DO HATE?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.673
WHOEVER IT WAS
AT PINKBERRY

04:42.717 --> 04:44.327
WHO DECIDED TO INTRODUCE
THAT PUMPKIN FLAVOR.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.502
CAN YOU IMAGINE
ALL THE FLAVORS

04:45.546 --> 04:46.808
THAT COULD BE IN ITS PLACE?

04:46.851 --> 04:48.244
PEPPERMINT, CHOCOLATE--

04:48.288 --> 04:50.290
THEY DON'T HAVE CHOCOLATE
AND THEY HAVE PUMPKIN.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.596
THEY DO HAVE CHOCOLATE.
THEY DO HAVE CHOCOLATE.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.511
I DON'T HATE 'EM ANYMORE.I GUESS
WHAT I'M SAYING IS

04:54.555 --> 04:56.513
THAT IF JOSH WANTS TO APOLOGIZE,
YOU SHOULD LET HIM.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.472
SO YOU WOULDN'T BE JEALOUS
IF I SAW JOSH?

04:58.515 --> 05:00.300
I MEAN, DON'T, LIKE,
HOOK UP WITH HIM.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.562
WELL, YOU BETTER NOT
HOOK UP WITH ANYONE

05:01.605 --> 05:03.041
WHILE YOU'RE HERE,
SOME CUTE NUN

05:03.085 --> 05:04.347
THAT YOU WORK WITH
OR SOMETHING.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.262
EVEN IF I DID, THAT'D BE
"NUN" OF YOUR BUSINESS.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.656
THAT'S AN OLD JOKE.IT WAS--
IT WAS FUNNY.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.353
IT WAS? NO, IT WASN'T.
IT WAS NOT FUNNY.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.702
WELL, THEN I HAVE
A BAD SENSE OF HUMOR,

05:11.746 --> 05:13.269
BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED IT.WELL, GOOD.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.792
SO, YOU'RE JUST REALLY
NOT GOING TO BE

YOU QUOTE THE BIBLE.

SHEL SILVERSTEIN, ACTUALLY.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.539
JOSH CALLED ME.NOPE.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.236
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE QUESTION IS.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.803
WHEN IT'S JOSH,
THE ANSWER'S NO.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.108
HE LIVES IN NEW MEXICO NOW,

07:37.152 --> 07:38.545
AND HE WANTS ME
TO VISIT HIM SO THAT

07:38.588 --> 07:39.894
HE CAN APOLOGIZE TO ME.COME ON.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.939
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT
WITH JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.506
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.160
CASEY'S THE ONE THAT THINKS
I SHOULD DO IT, ACTUALLY.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.988
HE THINKS I'M REALLY ANGRY,
AND THIS WOULD GIVE ME CLOSURE.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.642
CLOSURE? THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS CLOSURE.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.644
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING
DR. PHIL MADE UP,

07:50.687 --> 07:52.602
OR THE FUNERAL PARLOR
INDUSTRY.

07:52.646 --> 07:53.995
OKAY, BUDDY,
ONE RANT AT A TIME.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.300
I MEAN,
YOU THINK I HAD CLOSURE

07:55.344 --> 07:57.346
WHEN CHRISTINA CHEATED ON ME
AND RUINED MY LIFE?

07:57.389 --> 07:58.565
YOU THINK MY MOTHER
HAD CLOSURE

07:58.608 --> 08:00.001
WHEN MY FATHER
LEFT ALL OF US?

08:00.044 --> 08:01.785
NO. NO ONE HAD CLOSURE.
OKAY?

08:01.829 --> 08:02.917
AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE
MOVED ON FULLY

08:02.960 --> 08:05.267
FROM BOTH OF THOSE EVENTS.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.617
[sighs]

08:07.661 --> 08:10.402
NEW TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT US
WITH NEW OPPORTUNITIES

08:10.446 --> 08:12.579
WITH DIFFERENT
PROS AND CONS--

08:12.622 --> 08:15.320
NEW TECHNOLOGY
THAT SAVES LIVES.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.887
TOPICS WE WILL COVER
INCLUDE--

08:16.931 --> 08:18.889
[whispers]
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:18.933 --> 08:21.457
I HAVE FORGOTTEN
TO WEAR UNDERWEAR,

08:21.501 --> 08:24.591
AND IT IS VERY ARID
IN THIS CLIMATE,

08:24.634 --> 08:25.679
SO I'M FEELING
UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:25.722 --> 08:26.810
OKAY, WE GOT IT.JUST GO, JUST GO.

08:26.854 --> 08:29.857
I'M GONNA--YEP.
I'M GOING, SO JUST--

08:34.862 --> 08:39.127
YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO MEET JOSH.

08:39.170 --> 08:42.304
HEY. HOW DID YOU
BEAT ME TO THE CAR?

08:42.347 --> 08:44.001
DID YOU STOP
AT THE SNACK BAR?

08:44.045 --> 08:46.482
NO.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.440
COME ON. DON'T GO
MEET YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.746
WHAT COULD JOSH
POSSIBLY TELL YOU

08:49.790 --> 08:51.269
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS TRIP
WORTHWHILE?

08:51.313 --> 08:53.489
I NEED TO KNOW WHY HE DID
WHAT HE DID, OKAY?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.447
LIKE, MAYBE HE'S PART
OF TWINS,

08:55.491 --> 08:57.058
AND THE EVIL ONE WAS THE ONE
THAT CHEATED ON ME.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.581
I'M JUST NEVER GONNA
GET OVER IT

08:58.625 --> 08:59.843
IF I DON'T HEAR HIS SIDE.

08:59.887 --> 09:00.931
WELL, YOU CAN'T DRIVE.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.193
YOU HAD A MIMOSA
AT BREAKFAST.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.760
YOU KNOW THAT I SPILLED
MOST OF MY MIMOSA

09:03.804 --> 09:05.370
WHEN I WAS REACHING
FOR WAFFLES.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.546
SO, YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE THE WHEELS

09:06.589 --> 09:08.548
TO A DRUNKEN,
UNDOCUMENTED RENTEE?

09:08.591 --> 09:09.984
IT DOESN'T MATTER!
I-I'M GOING.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.942
WELL, THEN I'M DRIVING.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.248
YOU WOULD MISS
A DAY OF THE CONFERENCE

09:13.291 --> 09:14.379
JUST TO TAKE ME
TO THIS PLACE?

09:14.423 --> 09:15.555
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.600
MY SIGNATURE'S ON
THE RENTAL AGREEMENT.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.907
THAT LINE WAS HIGHLIGHTED,
BY THE WAY.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.822
DR. WALTERS,
I AM SO HONORED

09:21.865 --> 09:23.345
YOU WILL BE
AT MY PRESENTATION.

09:23.388 --> 09:26.043
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU ARE
THE LAPAROSCOPIC UTERINE KING.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.828
OH, PLEASE, THE ONLY ONE
WHO CALLS ME THAT

09:27.871 --> 09:29.917
IS MY VANITY LICENSE PLATE.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.440
[both laugh]

09:31.483 --> 09:33.224
DR. REED--IT'S GO GREAT JUST
TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU--

09:33.268 --> 09:35.313
DR. REED, I THINK
YOUR PHONE'S BROKEN.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.619
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
MY TEXTS.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.316
EXCUSE ME, GUYS, I'M GONNA--
CAN I SNEAK IN HERE?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.753
LITTLE SCOOCH.
THERE YOU GO.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.885
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?HEY, UH, MORGAN,

09:41.929 --> 09:42.930
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:42.973 --> 09:44.453
I-I'M HAVING LUNCH
WITH A COLLEAGUE.

09:44.496 --> 09:45.585
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

09:45.628 --> 09:46.716
OH, YEAH.
JER AND I WORK TOGETHER

09:46.760 --> 09:48.109
AT SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.545
NO ONE CALLS ME "JER."

09:49.589 --> 09:51.939
MORGAN IS A NURSE
AT OUR PRACTICE.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.506
RIGHT THERE, "R.N."

09:54.550 --> 09:56.944
MORGAN, WHERE DID YOU FIND
THAT MILK AND HOT DOG?

09:56.987 --> 09:59.555
OH, WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA PAY $12 FOR BRUNCH--

09:59.599 --> 10:00.774
HIGHWAY ROBBERY--

10:00.817 --> 10:02.514
SO, I, UH, FOUND THIS
GREAT LITTLE CAFE

10:02.558 --> 10:03.690
ACROSS THE STREET CALLED

10:03.733 --> 10:05.517
"THE NEW MEXICO
ANTI-HUNGER COALITION

10:05.561 --> 10:06.867
FOR THE DISABLED."

10:06.910 --> 10:08.999
ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.087
THIS WAS FREE.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.655
DANNY, DANNY,
DANNY, DANNY!

10:12.699 --> 10:13.830
THIS IS THE BEST GAS STATION

10:13.874 --> 10:15.484
I HAVE EVER BEEN TO
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.529
HOW DO I LOOK?YOU LOOK INDIAN.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.748
EXCUSE ME?

10:18.792 --> 10:21.490
I MEAN INDIAN--
AMERICAN INDIAN.I KNOW.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.100
OKAY.
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?IT'S FOR YOU--

10:23.144 --> 10:25.450
A KEYCHAIN
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.496
WHY WOULD I WANT THIS?

10:27.539 --> 10:28.715
DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY
YOU ARE TO HAVE A NAME

10:28.758 --> 10:30.455
THAT THEY ACTUALLY
PUT ON THINGS?

10:30.499 --> 10:31.979
I CAN NEVER FIND "MINDY"
ANYWHERE.

10:32.022 --> 10:32.980
I HAD TO GET "MANDY."

10:33.023 --> 10:35.286
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO GET ANYTHING.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.637
YOU KNOW, I WOULD
REALLY LOVE TO GET A DOG.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.335
I LOVE MY DOG.
SHE RUNS THE HOUSE, NOT ME.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.989
THAT'S JUST
DOG OBEDIENCE, DOC.REALLY?

10:42.032 --> 10:43.860
YEAH, YOU JUST GOTTA
GET A FIRM GRASP ON THE NECK.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.296
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
REAL QUICK.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.515
DUPE 'EM FOR A SEC.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.691
SO AT FIRST YOU'RE LIKE,
"AW, GOOD, GOOD."

10:48.735 --> 10:50.171
AND THEN YOU'RE LIKE,
"NO! NO!"

10:50.214 --> 10:51.781
NO, NO!
NO, MORGAN!

10:51.825 --> 10:53.348
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?HOLD ON. STOP.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.002
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?I WAS JUST
SHOWING HIM THE--

10:55.045 --> 10:57.047
DON'T--DON'T YOU
HAVE THAT THING AT 1:00

10:57.091 --> 10:58.962
YOU'VE GOTTA GO TO?

10:59.006 --> 11:00.137
WHAT?

11:00.181 --> 11:03.184
THAT THING AT 1:00.
YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.277
EVERY DAY AT 1:00 P.M.,

11:09.320 --> 11:11.409
I HAVE SCREAMING DIARRHEA.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.455
EVERY DAY.

11:13.498 --> 11:17.024
AND IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING
TO MY FRIENDS,

11:17.067 --> 11:19.461
SO I'M GONNA
GO DEAL WITH THAT.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.464
THANK YOU
FOR A GREAT BRUNCH.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.118
[Danny]
WE SHOULD
BE GETTING CLOSE.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.903
OH, MAN.
THIS IS A REALLY POSH AREA.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.818
OH, MY GOD, DANNY.
DO YOU THINK THE THING THAT

11:28.862 --> 11:30.428
JOSH WANTED TO TELL ME
IS THAT HE'S RICH NOW?

11:30.472 --> 11:31.778
SHOULD I GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH HIM?

11:31.821 --> 11:33.214
"CLEAR SANDS INSTITUTE."

11:33.257 --> 11:34.519
WHAT?
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT PLACE.

11:34.563 --> 11:35.738
THIS IS THE ADDRESS--

11:35.782 --> 11:37.827
2544 SOOTHING PALM DRIVE.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.481
THESE STREET NAMES
ARE KILLING ME.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.222
[Mindy] WAIT, WHY WOULD JOSH BE HERE?

11:41.265 --> 11:45.226
I THINK HE'S IN REHAB.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.274
SO THIS IS REHAB
THESE DAYS--

11:50.318 --> 11:52.276
MUST BE NICE.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.974
OH, MY GOD.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.497
JOSH WAS A DRUG ADDICT.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.759
I DID NOT KNOW
THIS ENTIRE TIME

11:56.803 --> 11:58.630
I WAS BASICALLY LIVING WALK THE LINE.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.023
YOU KNOW,
HE WAS JOHNNY CASH.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.373
I WAS REESE WITHERSPOON-CASH.NO, NO, NO.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.723
DON'T START
MAKING UP EXCUSES

12:03.766 --> 12:05.855
FOR SOME LOWLIFE JUNKIE.HEY.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.378
WE GOT WHAT WE CAME FOR.
HE WAS A DRUG ADDICT.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.771
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:08.815 --> 12:09.816
I HAVE TO GO SEE HIM.

12:09.859 --> 12:10.904
I NEED CLOSURE.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.644
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME
FIVE MINUTES, OKAY?

12:12.688 --> 12:13.950
JUST BE PATIENT.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.560
THANK YOU.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.521
HEY, DR. REED.HI.

12:19.564 --> 12:20.565
HOPE YOU HAD
A PLEASANT MORNING

12:20.609 --> 12:22.480
WITH YOUR DOCTOR FRIENDS.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.655
I WOULDN'T SAY PLEASANT,
EXACTLY.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.048
WE WENT TO A SEMINAR
ON CYST DRAINAGE.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.007
OKAY, LET'S SKIP
THE FRIENDLY CHITCHAT.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.399
LOOK, I CAME HERE
TO REHEARSE.

12:28.443 --> 12:32.012
MORGAN, I'M SORRY I ASKED YOU
TO LEAVE THE BRUNCH,

12:32.055 --> 12:33.840
BUT I CAME HERE TO INTERACT
WITH OTHER DOCTORS.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.798
YOU KNOW, I HAD A FRIEND
LIKE YOU BACK IN OTISVILLE.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.800
[sighs]WHEN WE WERE ALONE
IN OUR CELL,

12:37.844 --> 12:39.802
MELVIN AND I WERE
AS THICK AS THIEVES--

12:39.846 --> 12:41.891
HE WAS A THIEF.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.806
BUT WE'D GO OUT
INTO THE PRISON YARD,

12:43.850 --> 12:46.722
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE WAS MUFASA AL MUHAMMED

12:46.766 --> 12:48.811
AND I WAS "WHITE BITCH."THAT'S NOT THE SAME.

12:48.855 --> 12:49.812
I'M NOT A WHITE BITCH!THAT'S NOT THE SAME.

12:49.856 --> 12:50.813
I'M NOT A WHITE BITCH.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.816
I'M GONNA GO
EXPLORE SANTA FE.

12:53.860 --> 12:57.037
I DON'T WANNA
FORGET MY SUN HAT,

12:57.080 --> 12:59.256
LEST I BE BURNT TWICE TODAY.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.954
[sighs]
OKAY.

13:00.997 --> 13:04.435
MORGAN, COME ON, MATE.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.656
[sighs]

13:07.699 --> 13:10.137
SO MATTHEW CRAWLEY?
HE'S, LIKE, GONE.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.529
CRAWLEY?CRAWLEY.

13:11.573 --> 13:12.966
DAMN IT.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.881
WOW. WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH LADY SYBIL?

13:14.924 --> 13:16.360
MINDY.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.797
[Mindy]
HEY.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.975
WOW, YOU CAME.YEAH. HOW'S IT GOING?

13:22.018 --> 13:24.804
HELLO.
ARE YOU JOSH'S ROOMMATE?

13:24.847 --> 13:25.848
I'M CLAY MATTHEWS.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.023
I'M ON THE PACKERS.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.069
"PACKERS"?
IS THAT, LIKE, A PARTY DRUG?

13:29.112 --> 13:31.375
NO, UH, CLAY'S
AN OLD CLIENT OF MINE.

13:31.419 --> 13:32.986
OH, YOU'RE
A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.378
YOU'RE VISITING HIM.YES.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.163
UH, SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.I'M SO SORRY.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.991
SIT DOWN.I APOLOGIZE. I JUST--

13:38.034 --> 13:39.427
[clears throat]

13:39.470 --> 13:41.168
SO REHAB, HUH?WHAT?

13:41.211 --> 13:42.517
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.301
I THOUGHT I WAS
AT A PLANETARIUM.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.563
I'M KIDDING.

13:45.607 --> 13:46.913
I WAS DOING
A TON OF COCAINE.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.436
WHILE WE WERE TOGETHER?YES.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.872
OH, MY GOD.

13:49.916 --> 13:50.917
THAT IS WHY YOU
WOULD ALWAYS STAND UP

13:50.960 --> 13:52.353
IN SUNROOFS IN CARS
AND YELL,

13:52.396 --> 13:53.571
"I'M GONNA LIVE FOREVER."

13:53.615 --> 13:55.008
MINDY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.966
WHEN WE SPLIT UP,
I WAS A WRECK.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.316
I STARTED MISSING WORK,
MAKING CARELESS DECISIONS.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.057
HE TALKED ME INTO
DOING A SCARY MOVIE.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.712
I PLAYED
CAPTAIN JACK SPARE-RIBS.

14:03.755 --> 14:04.887
I STILL DON'T GET IT.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.062
THAT'S WHERE
I KNOW YOU FROM!

14:06.106 --> 14:07.455
WHEN WE COMMITTED,
WE WERE TOLD

14:07.498 --> 14:09.065
THE WAYANS BROTHERS
WOULD BE WAY MORE INVOLVED.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.024
ANYWAY, REHAB'S BEEN GREAT.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.852
I GO TO THERAPY, YOGA.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.463
I MADE A PAINTING
OF WHAT MY SPIRIT LOOKS LIKE.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.682
MINDY, I'M SO HAPPY
YOU CAME.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.250
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOSH?
SO AM I.

14:20.294 --> 14:23.775
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET A PHOTO
OF ME TACKLING YOU.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.516
SEX ADDICTION?
THAT'S NOT A REAL THING.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.648
COME ON, MAN.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.171
YOU GOT TOO MUCH TIME
ON YOUR HANDS.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.130
GO FOR A RUN OR MAKE A SHIP
IN A BOTTLE OR SOMETHING.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.522
WHAT'S YOUR DEAL, PAL?

14:31.566 --> 14:32.959
I AM ADDICTED
TO BODY BUILDING.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.917
NOPE.WHAT ABOUT MY ADDICTION

14:34.961 --> 14:36.788
TO NEEDING VALIDATION
FROM MEN?

14:36.832 --> 14:38.747
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?WAS THAT A GOOD QUESTION?

14:38.790 --> 14:40.401
NO, IT'S NOT--
LOOK, GUYS, GUYS.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.532
JUST LISTEN UP, OKAY?

14:41.576 --> 14:42.969
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO HEROIN ADDICTS?

14:43.012 --> 14:44.057
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT--

14:44.100 --> 14:45.406
RUDDY-FACED ALCOHOLICS.

14:45.449 --> 14:48.104
IT USED TO BE THAT A GUY
WOULD START SMOKING DOPE

14:48.148 --> 14:49.932
BECAUSE HE JUST
GOT BACK FROM VIETNAM

14:49.976 --> 14:51.281
AND HE CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HIS PAL

14:51.325 --> 14:52.761
HE LOST AT HAMBURGER HILL.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.458
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE THE GUY

14:54.502 --> 14:56.939
SLEEPING NEXT TO HER
ANYMORE.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.375
THAT'S ADDICTION.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.812
IS THIS, LIKE,
FROM A PLAY?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.466
NO.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.641
BUT THANK YOU.

15:03.685 --> 15:04.991
LOOK, THE POINT IS,

15:05.034 --> 15:06.949
EVERYONE HERE SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES,

15:06.993 --> 15:08.124
EXCEPT YOU, MA'AM.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.170
OVEREATING
IS A LEGITIMATE PROBLEM.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.345
FOOD IS A DRUG.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.782
I'M ADDICTED
TO BUYING FIGURINES.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.262
[groans]

15:15.305 --> 15:18.134
I'M SO SORRY, I DIDN'T-- [woman] IT'S FINE.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.702
YOU KNOW, I STILL BEAT MYSELF UP
OVER WHAT I DID TO YOU.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.051
YOU WERE ON DRUGS,
JOSH.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.792
YOU KNOW, ONCE WHEN I
WAS HIGH ON COUGH MEDICINE,

15:23.835 --> 15:25.794
I KISSED MY UNCLE,
FULL ON THE LIPS.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.970
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
EXCUSE WHAT I DID.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.189
I LIED TO YOU.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.539
I LET MY DEALER SHOWER
AT YOUR APARTMENT.

15:31.582 --> 15:32.975
WAIT, WHAT?

15:33.019 --> 15:35.021
I STOLE
YOUR PRESCRIPTION PAD.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.979
JOSH, WE FIRED OUR
CLEANING CREW 'CAUSE OF THAT.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.285
THEN I CHEATED ON HEATHER
WITH YOU.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.982
THAT I ACTUALLY
KNOW ABOUT.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.810
I CHEATED ON BOTH OF YOU
WITH A THIRD GIRL, MARISSA.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.986
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:44.030 --> 15:45.335
NO, I WAS
A COMPLETE MONSTER.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.902
THAT TIME YOU
HAD DENTAL SURGERY

15:46.946 --> 15:48.860
AND I COULDN'T PICK YOU UP
'CAUSE I SAID I HAD TO WORK...

15:48.904 --> 15:50.819
YEAH?I WAS WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.169
YOU WERE WITH MARISSA
WHEN I WAS GETTING A ROOT CANAL?

15:53.213 --> 15:54.997
NO.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.303
IT WAS A FOURTH GIRL.
ANN.

15:56.346 --> 15:59.045
YEAH.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.611
I LIED TO YOU A LOT.[screams]
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.135
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?
AAH! PLEASE!

16:02.178 --> 16:04.180
[clicking, beeping]

16:05.877 --> 16:08.880
OKAY, MORGAN'S DUFFEL.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.988

16:29.031 --> 16:31.033

16:35.255 --> 16:37.170
YEAH, WELL,
YOU WASTED YOUR TIME.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.041
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED YOU.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.303
BECAUSE I
GOT A NEW FRIEND.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.044
I GOT MY BOY, LEN.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.524
LEN, GIVE ME A SIGN,
BUDDY.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.352
ARE YOU THERE?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.441
WE GO BACK AND FORTH
LIKE THAT.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.877
MORGAN, I FOUND YOUR GIFT.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.053
THAT'S ACTUALLY
NOT FOR YOU.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.577
THAT--THAT IS FOR
JULIA ROBERTS,

16:53.621 --> 16:55.971

16:56.015 --> 16:57.886
OF MY FAVORITE ACTOR,

16:57.929 --> 16:59.409
MORGAN, I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE TREATED

16:59.453 --> 17:00.976
LIKE YOU'RE

17:01.020 --> 17:02.325
I'M KIND OF THE MORGAN

17:02.369 --> 17:03.848
REALLY? THE GARAGE DOOR
CLOSED ON YOUR NECK

17:03.892 --> 17:05.546
WHEN YOU WERE A BABY?
YEAH, RIGHT.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.852
I'M THE BLACK SHEEP.BUT YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.942
WHO WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL
IN AMERICA.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.944
THEY'RE EMBARRASSED OF ME.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.860
YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I DID TO YOU.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.949
AND I'M SORRY.APOLOGY NOT ACCEPTED.

17:17.993 --> 17:21.083
I-I GOT FEELINGS,

17:55.291 --> 17:56.292
I-I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU

17:56.336 --> 17:57.728
DID ALL OF THIS,
AND I HAD NO IDEA.

17:57.772 --> 18:00.122
WELL, IT REALLY
WASN'T THAT HARD.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.819
YOU'RE A SMART PERSON,

18:01.863 --> 18:03.865
BUT YOU HAVE A WAY
OF IGNORING THINGS,

18:03.908 --> 18:05.606
EVEN WHEN ALL THE SIGNS
ARE THERE.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.738
CLAY, IS HE TURNING THIS
WHOLE THING AROUND AGAINST ME?

18:07.782 --> 18:09.697
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY BOYFRIEND TOLD ME

18:09.740 --> 18:11.046

TO COME HERE

18:11.090 --> 18:12.265
AND SEE YOU FOR CLOSURE,

18:12.308 --> 18:13.831

SEEMS KIND OF WISE?MAYBE WE STAYED

18:54.829 --> 18:56.570
