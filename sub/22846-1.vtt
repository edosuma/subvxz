01:09.547 --> 01:13.539
Fuck, why didn't we get
a motel room before, huh?

01:13.539 --> 01:16.187
This is fucking great.

01:16.187 --> 01:18.021
Danielle was a lucky girl.

01:18.021 --> 01:21.966
If I had you, I'd never
let you leave the bedroom.

01:21.966 --> 01:23.474
What are you talking about?

01:23.474 --> 01:24.725
You are Danielle.

01:24.725 --> 01:27.808
Sorry stud, I'm Sharon.

01:27.898 --> 01:29.839
You're a great fuck, Nick.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.172
But I don't like loose ends.

02:12.955 --> 02:13.902
Cut!

02:13.902 --> 02:16.152
Oh, my God, he's drenched.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.619
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is a wrap

02:19.619 --> 02:22.671
on Crystal Force 15 Blood Angel.

02:25.506 --> 02:27.317
Oh, my God, I'm never working

02:27.317 --> 02:28.922
in ultra low budget again.

02:28.922 --> 02:30.347
It's gonna take a Silkwood shower

02:30.347 --> 02:32.964
to get all of this blood off of us.

02:32.964 --> 02:33.968
Good job, Shelley.

02:33.968 --> 02:35.516
Thanks.

02:35.516 --> 02:36.749
Can you go get our celebratory

02:36.749 --> 02:40.222
items from the craft services table?

02:40.222 --> 02:41.830
Ooo, champagne.

02:41.830 --> 02:43.950
Can you afford that on this budget?

02:43.950 --> 02:45.674
I mean, seriously.

02:45.674 --> 02:46.893
I'll do as many of these as you want.

02:46.893 --> 02:49.755
I mean, I survived, so I get to be

02:49.755 --> 02:53.005
in Crystal Force 16, right?

02:53.165 --> 02:53.998
Well.

03:00.873 --> 03:03.123
Dude, get up.

03:04.974 --> 03:05.974
He said cut.

03:07.323 --> 03:08.862
You said you needed
a ride to acting class.

03:08.862 --> 03:10.026
And I have to go to my acting class.

03:10.026 --> 03:11.709
So come on, get up, let's go.

03:11.709 --> 03:12.876
What the fuck!

03:14.038 --> 03:16.168
The answer to your question, Shelley.

03:16.168 --> 03:18.098
I don't think you're gonna
make it to the sequel.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.887
Holy shit, is he dead!

03:19.887 --> 03:21.999
Yes, Shelley, he's dead.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.924
God, she's so intuitive.

03:23.924 --> 03:27.026
Which is what makes you
such a great actress.

03:27.026 --> 03:29.021
That was sarcasm by the way.

03:29.021 --> 03:30.919
What is going on?

03:30.919 --> 03:32.227
What do you have the cheese knife

03:32.227 --> 03:34.021
from the craft services table?

03:34.121 --> 03:36.716
Get off of me, you fucking rapist.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.359
What is going on here?

03:39.359 --> 03:40.772
Do you know why Crystal Force

03:40.772 --> 03:44.210
is such a successful horror franchise?

03:44.210 --> 03:46.707
One of the most successful in history?

03:46.707 --> 03:48.809
Strong scripts?

03:48.809 --> 03:50.339
Hardly.

03:50.339 --> 03:51.542
Good direction?

03:52.075 --> 03:54.357
I'm flattered, but no.

03:54.857 --> 03:57.656
High value on such a low budget.

03:57.656 --> 03:59.465
Now, you just fucking with me.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.423
No, Shelley, the reason Crystal Force

04:01.423 --> 04:03.187
is such a successful franchise is

04:03.187 --> 04:06.672
because we practice what we preach.

04:06.672 --> 04:08.483
So at the end of every film, which is

04:08.483 --> 04:11.168
my favorite cast party,

04:11.168 --> 04:13.109
we cut out your fucking heart.

04:13.109 --> 04:14.132
And deliver it to the Master,

04:14.132 --> 04:16.649
who is also our executive producer.

04:16.649 --> 04:19.232
He casts a spell on it and bam!

04:20.112 --> 04:22.471
Direct to video gold.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.272
You can't kill me.

04:24.272 --> 04:26.449
My agent got me this gig.

04:26.449 --> 04:27.991
She knows where I am.

04:27.991 --> 04:29.994
And if I don't answer her
texts about auditions,

04:29.994 --> 04:33.422
she's gonna know this is
the last job I ever worked.

04:33.422 --> 04:35.648
God, she talks a lot.

04:35.648 --> 04:39.572
Your agent, my dear,
is part of the coven.

04:39.572 --> 04:43.292
And you didn't quite book
enough gigs this year.

04:53.139 --> 04:55.039
Please, I'll join your coven.

04:55.039 --> 04:57.206
I'll do anything you want.

05:48.133 --> 05:49.466
That's a wrap.

09:35.194 --> 09:37.023
So, should we have a friendly wager

09:37.023 --> 09:38.167
on whether or not I'm gonna have

09:38.167 --> 09:39.712
to save your ass from these witches

09:39.712 --> 09:42.054
covens in the third film?

09:42.054 --> 09:43.249
Actually, I'm kind of hoping

09:43.249 --> 09:45.386
I get to be an evil witch this time.

09:45.386 --> 09:49.219
So hopefully you'll be
saving someone else's ass from me.

09:49.219 --> 09:50.523
I think I saved your ass from

09:50.523 --> 09:53.881
a witches coven, twice,
Detective Gilmore,

09:53.881 --> 09:56.964
aka worst detective ever.

09:57.108 --> 10:00.901
I think I saved
both your assess in two movies.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.932
So, simmer down Greg Andrews,
aka worst

10:03.932 --> 10:06.208
warlock witch hunter ever.

10:09.223 --> 10:12.130
I totally hope
I get killed again in this one.

10:12.130 --> 10:13.307
Me too.

10:13.307 --> 10:14.541
<i>♫ Killed again dance ♫</i>

10:14.541 --> 10:17.477
<i>♫ And doing the killed again dance ♫</i>

10:17.477 --> 10:20.701
I'd actually like to
live through one for once.

10:21.248 --> 10:22.388
It's okay.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.533
Hey, where's Shelley?

10:23.533 --> 10:24.581
You guys remember her?

10:24.581 --> 10:26.941
Didn't she play Danielle in Blood Angel?

10:26.941 --> 10:28.805
Yeah, isn't she in this one two?

10:28.805 --> 10:30.227
We sort of bonded on Blood Angel

10:30.227 --> 10:34.113
but then I never saw her again,
very strange.

10:34.113 --> 10:35.859
I've literally kept up with three people

10:35.859 --> 10:38.933
I've met on set, over the past 10 years.

10:38.933 --> 10:41.438
We just go our own ways.

10:41.438 --> 10:42.271
Yeah, I know.

10:42.271 --> 10:43.470
But I ran into almost all you guys

10:43.470 --> 10:45.154
at auditions this last year.

10:45.154 --> 10:46.397
She just sort of vanished.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.184
Won't even answer her texts.

10:48.184 --> 10:49.798
Maybe she just went home.

10:49.798 --> 10:51.817
Plenty of people just give up and bail.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.533
Maybe, it's just weird.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.344
I'll tell you what's weird.

10:55.344 --> 10:57.112
Check out the IMDB listings for almost

10:57.112 --> 10:59.512
any actor in any Crystal Force movie.

10:59.512 --> 11:02.427
And see how many listings
they have after that.

11:02.427 --> 11:03.302
Like, a lot?

11:03.302 --> 11:04.806
Like zero.

11:04.806 --> 11:07.574
It's the Crystal Force curse.

11:07.574 --> 11:10.874
You do one Crystal Force movie
and you're done.

11:10.874 --> 11:12.837
Greta, what are you talking about?

11:12.837 --> 11:15.734
We've all done more than one
Crystal Force film.

11:15.734 --> 11:17.606
We did two, back to back, last summer.

11:17.606 --> 11:19.923
And we're about to do a table read for 16.

11:19.923 --> 11:22.469
I'm just saying,
from Crystal Force to Crystal Force 13,

11:22.469 --> 11:25.101
almost all those actors have disappeared.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.447
You stick around long enough,
you hear stories.

11:27.447 --> 11:29.745
Then why are you here?

11:29.745 --> 11:31.331
I didn't know about the curse

11:31.331 --> 11:33.344
until after I started shooting 14.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.480
When they asked me to do this one,

11:34.480 --> 11:35.605
I thought, "Keep your friends close

11:35.605 --> 11:37.613
"and your enemies closer."

11:37.613 --> 11:39.858
I wonder what happened
to all those other actors?

11:39.858 --> 11:42.571
Yeah, what do you think happened?
Do you think they actually

11:42.571 --> 11:43.695
got killed in those films?

11:43.695 --> 11:44.915
That's insane.

11:44.915 --> 11:46.882
You're insane.

11:46.924 --> 11:48.619
I'm just saying.

11:48.619 --> 11:49.819
Everyone, settle down.

11:49.819 --> 11:52.144
Your director extraordinaire,
Jamal is here.

11:52.144 --> 11:52.986
Come on in, Jamal.

11:52.986 --> 11:55.970
Give him a round of applause.
Come on in, Jamal.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.433
Hey, Jamal.

12:00.433 --> 12:01.349
I took care of it.

12:01.349 --> 12:02.299
Hey, everybody.

12:02.299 --> 12:03.509
Hey!

12:03.509 --> 12:04.510
Sorry about that.

12:04.510 --> 12:06.622
Welcome back to Crystal Force.

12:07.822 --> 12:12.739
All right, so... congrats.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.172
Crystal Force 14 and 15
did so well on VLD

12:16.172 --> 12:18.015
and auxiliary revenue streams,

12:18.015 --> 12:21.054
that the executive producer
wants to reboot the series.

12:21.054 --> 12:22.856
- All right!
- All right!

12:22.856 --> 12:25.288
And he wants to use, all of you.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.312
- Yeah.
- High five.

12:27.356 --> 12:28.356
High five.

12:30.178 --> 12:31.725
So, what we have, I believe,

12:31.725 --> 12:33.568
did you send out
the shooting scrips, obviously?

12:33.568 --> 12:34.937
Anyone missing any?

12:34.937 --> 12:35.770
Could I?

12:37.186 --> 12:40.624
All right, so, what you have there

12:40.624 --> 12:43.457
is Crystal Force 16 Freshman Year.

12:45.028 --> 12:46.205
How about we just give it a read

12:46.205 --> 12:47.763
and then we can talk about all

12:47.763 --> 12:49.667
the pertinent production details.

12:50.459 --> 12:51.542
Sorry, guys.

12:53.078 --> 12:58.245
I love, I love, I love how,
I have your undivided attention.

12:58.352 --> 12:59.676
Damn it, I'm so sorry,

12:59.676 --> 13:01.005
it's a call back for a regular series.

13:01.005 --> 13:02.403
It's a gig.

13:02.403 --> 13:03.818
I wouldn't even ask but the producers

13:03.818 --> 13:04.956
want to see me right now.

13:04.956 --> 13:06.198
And it's really important.

13:06.198 --> 13:08.820
Okay, all right, sure.

13:08.820 --> 13:11.354
Just keep an eye on your email
for the shooting schedule.

13:11.354 --> 13:13.220
- Okay, thanks Jamal.
- Hmm.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.432
You guys have a good read.

13:14.432 --> 13:15.471
I'll see you on the set.

13:15.471 --> 13:17.054
- Good luck.
- Bye.

13:18.109 --> 13:18.951
Anybody else?

13:19.451 --> 13:21.393
Phone calls, emails.

13:21.393 --> 13:23.946
- All right, shut your phone off please.
- Yeah.

13:25.146 --> 13:28.479
All right, okay,

13:30.222 --> 13:32.400
let's turn to page one.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.507
Let's start at the top.

13:33.507 --> 13:36.296
I'll read all the stage directions.

13:36.696 --> 13:39.571
Crystal Force, origins by yours truly.

13:39.571 --> 13:42.243
Producer, director, now screenwriter?

13:42.243 --> 13:45.183
Is there anything this man can't do?

13:45.183 --> 13:46.940
Bring a movie in under budget.

13:48.949 --> 13:50.338
You know what?

13:50.338 --> 13:52.147
Just for that,
I'm gonna kill your character

13:52.147 --> 13:54.042
off first in the re-write.

13:56.147 --> 13:58.715
All right, all right, back to business.

13:58.715 --> 14:01.663
"Fade in, interior, suburban home.

14:01.663 --> 14:03.263
"Day, Greg Andrews is putting

14:03.263 --> 14:05.935
"the finishing touches on killing a witch,

14:05.935 --> 14:09.935
"in a huge house,
in Orange County, California."

14:24.369 --> 14:25.801
You want naughty nurse?

14:25.801 --> 14:28.008
I'll give you naughty nurse.

14:28.008 --> 14:33.925
Doctor, superhero, waitress, nurse.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.431
Nice try, Pazuza.

14:37.431 --> 14:39.230
If you're the most powerful
witch in the coven,

14:39.230 --> 14:40.579
you're gonna have a lot of trouble

14:40.579 --> 14:43.412
keeping the door open, guaranteed.

15:21.999 --> 15:23.399
"Burn their bones.

15:23.399 --> 15:26.524
"Then scatter the ashes
from here to Orange County.

15:26.524 --> 15:28.447
"The remains of the coven
must be separated

15:28.447 --> 15:31.566
"to prevent
the resurrection of the Master.

15:31.566 --> 15:34.063
"But now that even the Master is gone,

15:34.063 --> 15:36.735
"his apocalypse are legion.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.811
"With your newfound powers
comes responsibility.

15:39.811 --> 15:41.611
"You must ever be vigilant, because

15:41.611 --> 15:43.701
"now you're Oxnard's first line of defense

15:43.701 --> 15:45.957
"against the dark arts.

15:45.957 --> 15:47.755
"Best of luck."

15:47.755 --> 15:49.019
"Greg Andrews turns and walks

15:49.019 --> 15:51.453
"into the sunset,
leaving Brittney and Chelsea

15:51.453 --> 15:54.010
"standing over the bodies of the coven.

15:54.010 --> 15:58.843
- "As we fade to black."
- Yeah.

16:01.641 --> 16:03.051
Okay, since Origins kind of folds

16:03.051 --> 16:05.197
back on itself, um, you have the...

16:05.197 --> 16:06.039
Yeah, the DVDs.

16:06.039 --> 16:07.047
Thank you.

16:07.047 --> 16:07.748
I thought it would be great

16:07.748 --> 16:09.621
to reference some of the older
Crystal Force movies.

16:09.621 --> 16:11.030
So you guys should maybe team together

16:11.030 --> 16:12.613
and check them out.

16:13.253 --> 16:15.753
Let me introduce you to, DVDs.

16:16.697 --> 16:18.239
Guys and sel-a-mon.

16:18.239 --> 16:19.072
Got it.

16:20.910 --> 16:24.996
Ooo, Crystal Force 10
Headmistress of Magic, spooky.

16:24.996 --> 16:26.668
I'm actually in that one.

16:26.668 --> 16:27.845
Shut up.

16:27.845 --> 16:31.617
And this one,
Crystal Force School The New Class.

16:31.617 --> 16:33.437
Unfairly overlooked for

16:33.437 --> 16:35.604
an Oscar nomination, if you ask me.

16:38.481 --> 16:39.962
All right, keep an eye on your emails

16:39.962 --> 16:43.530
for rehearsal schedule and call sheets.

16:43.530 --> 16:44.940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.485
You're welcome.

16:46.485 --> 16:47.318
Don't die.

16:48.342 --> 16:49.242
Don't die.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.605
- All right.
- You gonna need any specialty items

16:57.605 --> 17:00.380
for the craft service, or anything?

17:00.380 --> 17:01.665
Yeah, we'll take care of it later.

17:01.665 --> 17:02.758
All right.

17:02.758 --> 17:04.390
Think they're gonna watch
the movies or not?

17:04.390 --> 17:05.425
A lot of times you give them things

17:05.425 --> 17:07.685
they just say they're gonna watch them.

17:07.685 --> 17:09.328
I'll know when they watch them or not.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.298
They better watch them.

17:10.298 --> 17:11.219
I gotta take care of something.

17:11.219 --> 17:12.051
They don't know who you are,

17:12.051 --> 17:14.925
you're extraordinaire Jamal.

17:21.536 --> 17:25.953
Wow, looks like Henry gets a reprieval.

17:26.147 --> 17:30.205
Despite the fact that we killed
his ass in Crystal Force.

17:32.762 --> 17:34.629
I can take it.

17:38.153 --> 17:39.780
Do it!

17:39.780 --> 17:40.613
Ahhhhhh!

17:48.577 --> 17:49.728
Do it, Rose!

17:49.728 --> 17:50.561
Ahhhhh!

18:07.346 --> 18:11.070
Well, the fans demanded my return, so.

18:11.470 --> 18:15.073
Yeah, well, you wanna come over
and watch them then?

18:15.073 --> 18:19.105
Seeing as how we're gonna be
playing Henry and Linda again.

18:19.105 --> 18:21.688
Flashback to Linda and Henry.

18:24.959 --> 18:28.676
Yeah, whatever,
flashback to Henry and Linda.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.682
So you wanna come over and watch?

18:31.682 --> 18:36.099
Sure but, my soap opera on camera class

18:36.294 --> 18:40.406
let's out at 7:00,
so how about eightish?

18:40.406 --> 18:41.622
All right, that'll work.

18:41.622 --> 18:43.226
I have a cold read for commercial class

18:43.226 --> 18:44.437
that gets out at 6:30.

18:44.437 --> 18:47.529
I can just swing by the store
and get something to eat.

18:47.529 --> 18:49.362
- Awesome.
- All right.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.083
Hey, come on in.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.589
Thanks for having me over.

19:22.589 --> 19:24.488
I brought this.

19:24.488 --> 19:26.655
Hmm, fancy.

19:27.307 --> 19:30.629
I happen to know that
this bottle of wine

19:30.629 --> 19:33.962
costs about $10.

19:35.065 --> 19:36.898
Well, only the best.

19:41.903 --> 19:46.713
Speaking of fancy,
how can you afford this place?

19:46.713 --> 19:47.796
Two things.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.730
My grandma left it to me,
right after she passed.

19:52.730 --> 19:55.595
And it was pretty much all paid off then.

19:55.595 --> 20:00.063
Second, you remember that
Little Christy's commercial?

20:00.063 --> 20:03.280
The one with the little girl
and the kitten?

20:03.280 --> 20:07.724
It aired like,
a billion times a day in the 80s.

20:07.724 --> 20:09.022
And then that same little girl

20:09.022 --> 20:11.819
was on all the packaging?

20:11.819 --> 20:14.702
- That was you?
- Yep.

20:15.117 --> 20:17.595
I ended up putting it all
in a trust fund.

20:17.595 --> 20:20.178
And paying it off when I turned 18.

20:25.369 --> 20:28.202
I made fucking bank off that shit.

20:30.038 --> 20:32.538
Well, here's to child labor.

20:34.176 --> 20:39.009
Child labor and... shitty $10 wine.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.148
I have cheap tastes.

20:41.648 --> 20:46.315
Hmmm, speaking of,
are you ready for the main event?

20:57.461 --> 21:02.028
Crystal Force 315 million.

21:02.117 --> 21:03.784
I have high hopes.

21:26.826 --> 21:30.993
This is actually not half bad.

21:32.542 --> 21:36.635
I wonder what happened
to these... actors?

21:36.635 --> 21:38.635
Hmm, who knows?

21:39.701 --> 21:41.384
You can make a pretty decent living

21:41.384 --> 21:44.969
off of commercials and
random guest spots on TV

21:44.969 --> 21:47.802
and still remain pretty invisible.

21:56.261 --> 21:57.423
Where are they?

21:57.423 --> 21:58.673
Where are we?

22:01.455 --> 22:03.180
I don't see them anymore.

22:04.380 --> 22:06.713
Come on, Rose.

22:08.319 --> 22:09.957
Carter?

22:13.399 --> 22:14.232
Carter.

22:20.221 --> 22:23.554
- Honey.
- Don't resist me, you know you want it.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.740
I can't, can't do this.

22:31.740 --> 22:37.657
Stan, Kelly, anybody?

22:47.821 --> 22:50.071
Oh, what's happening to me!

23:00.475 --> 23:02.360
Greetings Will Spanner.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.873
It's you, you're the demon Abadon.

23:05.873 --> 23:08.040
I don't fear you, go away.

23:09.622 --> 23:13.445
Master promises to spare, all the others

23:13.445 --> 23:15.334
if you return your allegiance to him,

23:15.334 --> 23:16.751
where it belongs.

23:18.364 --> 23:19.142
You go back to hell and you tell him,

23:19.142 --> 23:22.131
he will never have me voluntarily.

23:22.131 --> 23:25.281
Oh, God, no!

24:06.148 --> 24:09.235
How come the guys never get naked?

24:09.235 --> 24:12.318
No, I don't know,
they have better agents.

25:03.799 --> 25:05.049
You see that?

25:06.769 --> 25:08.436
See what?

25:21.129 --> 25:23.629
- Hey.
- Master Abadon.

25:24.301 --> 25:25.218
Hey what?

25:27.573 --> 25:29.990
It's pretty hot, don't you think?

25:33.092 --> 25:34.308
Well, yeah, if you like watching

25:34.308 --> 25:38.093
naked people have sex is incredibly hot.

25:38.093 --> 25:40.760
That's the funny thing though.

25:41.664 --> 25:44.831
I love watching naked people have sex.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.524
Whoa, what are you doing?

25:48.524 --> 25:50.166
Research.

25:50.166 --> 25:51.519
For what?

25:51.519 --> 25:53.832
For our sex scene in the film.

25:53.832 --> 25:56.423
We don't have a sex scene in the film.

25:56.423 --> 25:58.923
But we should, shouldn't we?

25:59.796 --> 26:02.134
Okay, okay, wait, hold on.

26:02.134 --> 26:04.442
I'm totally into this.

26:04.442 --> 26:06.838
And I mean totally into what I think

26:06.838 --> 26:08.877
is about to happen here, but I wanna

26:08.877 --> 26:10.371
be sure for both of our sake that

26:10.371 --> 26:13.424
you're not just drunk off
of this shitty wine.

26:13.824 --> 26:15.902
Or secretly on drugs, or something

26:15.902 --> 26:16.983
that make you out of your mind

26:16.983 --> 26:18.294
to want to have sex with me.

26:18.294 --> 26:20.377
You wanna do this, right?

27:20.368 --> 27:22.451
What's the matter, baby?

27:22.666 --> 27:25.209
You never pulled a we-and before?

28:16.938 --> 28:18.425
Oh, my God!

28:18.425 --> 28:19.779
Oh, my God!

28:19.779 --> 28:21.529
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

28:22.467 --> 28:23.800
Sharon.

28:27.113 --> 28:27.946
Jamal?

28:28.854 --> 28:31.315
Jamal? What are you doing here?

28:31.315 --> 28:33.148
Oh, oh, God.

28:34.189 --> 28:35.022
Here.

28:43.036 --> 28:44.286
Sharon, Sharon.

28:45.393 --> 28:46.893
Sharon, look at me.

28:50.069 --> 28:51.843
Sharon, do you remember what happened?

28:51.843 --> 28:57.760
Yes, Samuel and I, we were,

28:58.032 --> 29:01.032
we were watching the movie and then,

29:02.903 --> 29:05.719
and then something
started happening to the screen.

29:05.719 --> 29:09.288
And then Samuel couldn't see the screen.

29:11.555 --> 29:14.208
And then something
started to take over me.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.791
I don't know how to explain it.

29:18.864 --> 29:21.271
And then I wanted to kill Samuel.

29:21.271 --> 29:24.864
And then I was happy
that it was happening.

29:24.864 --> 29:28.864
And then, Samuel's dead.

29:30.078 --> 29:33.495
Is this terrible?

29:36.559 --> 29:40.059
No, no, it's not.

29:42.031 --> 29:43.267
Sharon, what I'm about to tell you

29:43.267 --> 29:46.288
is gonna sound absolutely insane.

29:46.288 --> 29:48.288
But it's 100% true.

29:51.641 --> 29:54.940
The Crystal Force movie are hexed.

29:54.940 --> 29:57.773
I know, because I helped hex them.

29:59.478 --> 30:01.811
You, you what?

30:04.572 --> 30:06.292
Sharon, I'm part of a very powerful

30:06.292 --> 30:09.346
group of witches and warlocks.

30:09.346 --> 30:12.335
We use the Crystal Force movies to

30:12.335 --> 30:14.585
find others of our kind.

30:16.957 --> 30:21.070
Those people who were born
with dark magic powers.

30:21.070 --> 30:25.074
The hex helps bring those powers to light.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.241
I'm a witch.

30:29.192 --> 30:31.442
Yes, you are.

30:33.353 --> 30:36.277
And that's a very good thing.

30:36.277 --> 30:38.446
Our coven is growing.

30:38.446 --> 30:39.693
Soon we'll be one of the most powerful

30:39.693 --> 30:41.576
covens on the East coast.

30:42.810 --> 30:45.310
And now, you're a part of that.

30:50.069 --> 30:51.402
This is what we're gonna do.

30:52.628 --> 30:54.408
I'm gonna take you back to
my place to get cleaned up.

30:54.408 --> 30:56.470
And you'll get some rest.

30:56.470 --> 30:57.425
And then some of the coven members

30:57.425 --> 31:00.008
will come and clean your house.

31:04.750 --> 31:07.179
Yes, even Samuel's body.

31:07.179 --> 31:08.345
And then I can answer any questions

31:08.345 --> 31:09.845
that you may have.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.124
And we'll go from there.

31:12.124 --> 31:13.407
Is that okay?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.576
Or, I can just call the cops.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.409
And you can go to jail for murder.

31:22.857 --> 31:25.940
So, my place?

32:03.087 --> 32:04.984
God, I love doughnuts.

32:04.984 --> 32:06.884
Never touch them.

32:06.884 --> 32:08.926
Wait, is that you saying that?

32:08.926 --> 32:13.048
Or are you doing
some cop detective character work?

32:13.048 --> 32:15.573
If you couldn't tell, I'm a genius.

32:15.773 --> 32:16.606
Sure.

32:21.112 --> 32:24.308
This is the Witch School
16 Freshman Year set, right?

32:24.308 --> 32:25.141
Ah.

32:25.912 --> 32:28.763
Yeah. Sort of,
in the broad sense of the word.

32:28.763 --> 32:31.347
Great, I'm looking for Jamal,
the director.

32:31.347 --> 32:32.360
Ah.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.741
He's in there shooting a scene.

32:34.741 --> 32:37.171
Oh, shit, that means I'm late.

32:37.171 --> 32:38.398
You're in a scene?

32:38.398 --> 32:40.637
Yeah, I'm playing Henry.

32:40.637 --> 32:41.946
Patrick.

32:41.946 --> 32:43.205
Garner.

32:43.205 --> 32:44.425
Lutz.

32:44.425 --> 32:45.841
Nice to meet you both.

32:45.841 --> 32:47.165
The set's up there?

32:47.165 --> 32:47.998
Thanks.

32:51.130 --> 32:53.130
Holy shit.

32:54.618 --> 32:55.962
That is one good looking man.

32:55.962 --> 32:57.625
And I'm not even gay.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.914
Understatement of the century.

32:59.914 --> 33:02.530
But isn't Samuel playing Henry again?

33:02.530 --> 33:04.616
Maybe he's got
his character name mixed up.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.907
He wasn't at the read through.

33:06.907 --> 33:08.070
That's weird, I'll text Samuel

33:08.070 --> 33:10.357
and see if he's got
a bigger gig or something.

33:10.357 --> 33:13.046
Wait, you're not gay?

33:14.046 --> 33:14.879
No.

33:15.510 --> 33:17.710
Huh, hmm.

33:20.780 --> 33:22.542
Go ahead and say the first line.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.010
Let me hear it.

33:24.010 --> 33:25.897
"Uh-huh, I don't know what you mean.

33:25.897 --> 33:27.732
"What power are you talking about?"

33:27.732 --> 33:29.029
Okay, now, remember, she really

33:29.029 --> 33:32.096
- wants him to help her, but not really.
- Okay.

33:32.103 --> 33:34.341
- Okay.
- Hi, Jamal?

33:34.341 --> 33:35.425
- Hi.
- Apologies for being late.

33:35.425 --> 33:36.793
No problem, none at all,

33:36.793 --> 33:39.836
we're just setting up a scene
with a few lights.

33:39.836 --> 33:41.132
Rose, this is Patrick, he will be

33:41.132 --> 33:44.527
taking over for Samuel
in the role of Henry.

33:44.527 --> 33:45.994
Yes, you are.

33:45.994 --> 33:47.086
I mean, hi.

33:47.086 --> 33:48.854
- Hi.
- Hello.

33:48.854 --> 33:50.965
Have you had a chance
to look over the scene?

33:50.965 --> 33:53.098
- Okay.
- All right.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.855
So, why don't we rehearse a little bit

33:54.855 --> 33:56.620
while Brian continues to set up lights.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.708
And we'll go from there.

33:58.708 --> 34:01.209
So, as a reminder, this was the first

34:01.209 --> 34:04.393
seduction scene between Iris and Henry.

34:04.393 --> 34:05.909
Now, remember, Iris is the mother

34:05.909 --> 34:08.032
of your character in Crystal Force 14

34:08.032 --> 34:11.321
and 15, so, let that inform you and use

34:11.321 --> 34:13.268
whatever choices you wanna
make in this scene.

34:13.268 --> 34:14.896
- Of course.
- Okay.

34:14.896 --> 34:17.475
Let's have you move over just slightly.

34:17.475 --> 34:19.431
- There, a little bit, right there.
- Okay.

34:19.431 --> 34:20.585
And let's have you go over here.

34:20.585 --> 34:21.744
These are your first positions.

34:21.744 --> 34:23.411
- Okay.
- Let's give it a try.

34:25.388 --> 34:29.476
I can feel your power,
just standing here.

34:29.476 --> 34:31.168
I don't know what you mean.

34:31.168 --> 34:34.404
What power are you talking about?

34:34.404 --> 34:36.570
The talent you possess inside you.

34:36.570 --> 34:39.853
Locked away, forced down, by generations

34:39.853 --> 34:42.717
of weak willed men and women.

34:42.717 --> 34:44.710
Who were frightened of
their true potential.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.607
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:46.607 --> 34:49.099
There's nothing special about me.

34:49.099 --> 34:52.228
I have no talents, I'm powerless.

34:52.228 --> 34:54.059
You are not powerless.

34:54.059 --> 34:55.391
Let me show you.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.410
You scare me.

35:00.693 --> 35:02.526
I should, let me in.

35:04.162 --> 35:07.675
Allow me to free the power inside you.

35:07.675 --> 35:08.758
I'm afraid.

35:10.057 --> 35:12.410
Of course you are.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.792
Will it hurt?

35:13.792 --> 35:15.172
Yes.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.867
Release me.

35:37.502 --> 35:40.792
Open yourself to the power within you.

35:40.792 --> 35:41.959
Free yourself.

35:44.092 --> 35:46.009
Ahhhhhhh!

36:01.884 --> 36:04.311
That coffee
cold enough for you yet?

36:04.311 --> 36:05.927
Huh?

36:05.927 --> 36:08.682
The coffee, that
you've been meticulously

36:08.682 --> 36:11.515
preparing for the last 10 minutes.

36:12.542 --> 36:14.125
Oh, no, it's fine.

36:15.094 --> 36:17.545
Sorry, I'm a little spacey at the moment.

36:17.545 --> 36:19.162
I need to get back in there.

36:19.362 --> 36:20.388
For what?

36:20.388 --> 36:23.334
Jamal wrapped us 15 minutes ago.

36:23.334 --> 36:26.035
But I have a scene to shoot.

36:26.035 --> 36:29.535
Girl, you already shot your scene today.

36:30.702 --> 36:32.452
What's going on here?

36:33.590 --> 36:35.572
Are you using?

36:35.572 --> 36:36.645
What?

36:36.645 --> 36:38.769
No, oh, my God, no, no, I hate drugs.

36:38.769 --> 36:42.269
I just, sorry, I'm just tired.

36:43.142 --> 36:44.826
My day job's killing me.

36:44.826 --> 36:45.874
We'll check the call sheet.

36:45.874 --> 36:47.585
You may have a couple days off.

36:47.585 --> 36:50.304
I think Jamal is hosting
a screening for one

36:50.304 --> 36:54.380
of the films, tomorrow at some point,
you should come.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.797
I will, thanks.

36:56.838 --> 36:59.005
All right, well, I'm outie.

36:59.740 --> 37:01.823
I'll walk out with you.

37:07.897 --> 37:10.421
- It's officially weird.
- What?

37:10.421 --> 37:12.166
Samuel and I aren't great friends,

37:12.166 --> 37:13.285
but we hung out a couple of times

37:13.285 --> 37:14.382
since the last shoot.

37:14.382 --> 37:17.374
He hasn't answered my texts
or my phone calls

37:17.374 --> 37:19.263
since being replaced on the film.

37:19.263 --> 37:21.187
Well, maybe he got a location gig

37:21.187 --> 37:23.249
and he's on a plane right now.

37:23.249 --> 37:24.568
Here's another weird thing.

37:24.568 --> 37:26.525
Greta is being replaced in the film.

37:26.525 --> 37:29.097
That's what Ivan told me.

37:29.097 --> 37:31.355
Oh, she got the pilot,
well, good for her.

37:31.355 --> 37:33.834
She only had a nine day shoot,
with only three scenes.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.524
How could they find
a replacement so fast?

37:36.524 --> 37:37.667
I have no idea.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.811
I guess she's right about the curse.

37:39.811 --> 37:40.644
Garner!

37:41.554 --> 37:43.038
Look, we've got two cast members

37:43.038 --> 37:44.551
getting gigs and then disappearing

37:44.551 --> 37:46.189
right before the shoot date.

37:46.189 --> 37:49.078
And Jamal happens to find
a replacement for Samuel?

37:49.078 --> 37:50.940
Doesn't that seem kind of fishy to you?

37:50.940 --> 37:53.876
Well, welcome to
low budget film production.

37:53.876 --> 37:57.043
- So...
- So, we should investigate, seriously.

37:58.708 --> 38:01.854
Please, I beg of you, stop doing

38:01.854 --> 38:06.487
all this Uta Hagen,
background character work.

38:06.513 --> 38:10.192
This is Crystal Force 16,
trust me, you're good.

38:10.192 --> 38:12.700
This is legit,
this isn't character work.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.345
Whatever, I'm going for a drink.

38:15.345 --> 38:16.595
Are you coming?

38:18.245 --> 38:20.245
No, I got stuff to do.

38:21.804 --> 38:24.137
Okay, see you.

38:34.527 --> 38:38.277
Hey, you did a great job today.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.317
I see why you came
so highly recommended.

38:40.317 --> 38:42.956
Yeah. It was easy,
she was ripe for it.

38:45.357 --> 38:49.105
We've been cultivating
her since Crystal Force 14.

38:49.105 --> 38:49.938
Really?

38:51.582 --> 38:53.570
Yes, we've been here before.

38:53.570 --> 38:56.225
And it hasn't worked out well.

38:56.225 --> 38:59.302
There have been a lot of faith
placed on your assurances.

38:59.302 --> 39:01.469
You can bring this to fruition for us.

39:04.594 --> 39:06.667
I won't disappoint.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.760
I can guarantee that.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.343
What about Greta?

39:12.092 --> 39:14.425
She took the other offer.

39:14.425 --> 39:15.454
What about the role?

39:15.454 --> 39:17.457
Do you have someone else to replace her?

39:17.457 --> 39:19.154
I don't need to.

39:19.154 --> 39:21.654
Look it was just a minor role.

39:23.710 --> 39:25.293
I can do a rewrite.

40:00.812 --> 40:04.512
Done, I think it's much tighter now.

40:04.589 --> 40:07.137
I cleaned up some
extraneous action in act three.

40:08.137 --> 40:10.390
Very clever, very clever.

40:10.390 --> 40:13.171
The times for the coven's ascension
is almost upon us.

40:13.171 --> 40:16.064
You have eight more days,

40:16.064 --> 40:19.397
to call the most powerful,
from your production.

40:20.482 --> 40:23.062
Then we're right on schedule.

40:23.062 --> 40:25.903
Good, I must leave you now.

40:26.103 --> 40:27.624
I mustn't be late.

40:27.624 --> 40:29.369
Is there a coven meeting
I don't know about?

40:29.769 --> 40:31.846
Actors showcase.

40:32.873 --> 40:35.325
Thinking about changing
my representation.

40:35.325 --> 40:39.158
All right then, till next time.

40:42.968 --> 40:45.618
All right, where was I?

41:14.171 --> 41:15.004
Sharon,

41:20.456 --> 41:21.289
Sharon,

41:23.991 --> 41:24.824
Sharon?

41:25.503 --> 41:26.336
Jamal?

41:29.406 --> 41:30.573
Are you ready?

41:32.224 --> 41:33.424
Yes, I've been

41:33.424 --> 41:35.757
studying my lines all night.

41:38.985 --> 41:41.983
Are you ready to do
the Masters bidding?

41:41.983 --> 41:46.733
Oh, that, yes, I'm ready.

41:48.431 --> 41:52.931
Tomorrow, you will choose
the strongest.

41:55.151 --> 42:00.318
Tomorrow, you will choose
the next member of the coven.

42:21.819 --> 42:23.732
This is gonna be good.

42:46.927 --> 42:52.177
Tomorrow I will choose the strongest.

42:58.707 --> 43:00.734
Okay, what the fuck!

43:00.734 --> 43:01.925
Did you get my messages?

43:01.925 --> 43:04.260
Yes, I got your 500 messages.

43:04.260 --> 43:05.825
Why do you think I'm here?

43:05.825 --> 43:08.068
And today was my day off.

43:08.068 --> 43:11.131
And, spoiler alert, I wasn't planning

43:11.131 --> 43:13.222
on spending them with you.

43:13.222 --> 43:14.526
What took you so long?

43:14.526 --> 43:15.921
The line was out the door.

43:15.921 --> 43:17.060
Can we just get to the part where

43:17.060 --> 43:20.055
you tell me why we're meeting
in a random parking lot?

43:20.055 --> 43:22.165
Because I've got
something very important

43:22.165 --> 43:24.675
to talk to you about,
isn't quite enough.

43:24.675 --> 43:26.068
Do you remember what Greta said about

43:26.068 --> 43:28.630
all the Crystal Force curses?

43:28.630 --> 43:29.336
I'm leaving.

43:29.336 --> 43:32.025
I know how it sounds,
but look at this, look at this.

43:32.025 --> 43:35.995
Okay, this is a list of all the actors

43:35.995 --> 43:38.662
who appeared in
all the Crystal Force films.

43:42.618 --> 43:45.439
Why are most of the names
crossed off?

43:45.639 --> 43:47.117
Most of the names are crossed off

43:47.117 --> 43:50.511
because 90% of
all the actors quit the business.

43:51.511 --> 43:53.328
Okay, so?

43:53.397 --> 43:54.964
So, don't you think that's weird?

43:54.964 --> 43:58.360
Not really, actors quit all the time.

43:58.360 --> 43:59.586
Granted, but you know what?

43:59.586 --> 44:01.791
I did my research and
this is what I found.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.488
I'm on the edge of my seat.

44:03.488 --> 44:06.529
None of the actors who quit
the Crystal Force films,

44:06.529 --> 44:07.436
have a Facebook page.

44:07.436 --> 44:08.874
None of them except Samuel.

44:08.874 --> 44:10.538
And he hasn't touched his since

44:10.538 --> 44:12.697
the day before he disappeared.

44:12.697 --> 44:17.297
Okay, I'm gonna ask you this

44:17.324 --> 44:19.791
and I need you to
ell me the truth, okay?

44:19.791 --> 44:20.866
Absolutely.

44:20.866 --> 44:21.807
Are you on drugs?

44:21.807 --> 44:22.834
No, I'm not on drugs.

44:22.834 --> 44:24.439
I promise, I'm not on drugs.

44:24.439 --> 44:25.863
This is real.

44:25.863 --> 44:27.858
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

44:27.858 --> 44:29.083
This is Jamal.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.803
We worked with him before.

44:30.803 --> 44:32.708
What are you gonna do,
quit the movie?

44:32.708 --> 44:33.341
I don't know.

44:33.341 --> 44:35.985
Don't quit the movie,
don't be dumb.

44:36.385 --> 44:39.016
Go home and get some rest

44:39.016 --> 44:41.193
and we can talk about this later.

44:46.895 --> 44:48.980
Hey, guys, Crystal Force sequel screening

44:48.980 --> 44:52.014
tonight at Sharon's, who's in?

44:52.014 --> 44:52.898
Don't go.

44:52.898 --> 44:53.900
Garner.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.591
Don't go.

44:55.591 --> 44:57.519
What am I going to tell him?

44:57.519 --> 44:58.960
I don't know?
Tell him that two actors want to

44:58.960 --> 45:00.031
do their scene together.

45:00.031 --> 45:03.226
What director wouldn't want
their actors to rehearse?

45:03.426 --> 45:08.926
Oh, my God, fine.

45:12.986 --> 45:23.153
Can't make it, Garner and
I working on scenes, send.

45:23.935 --> 45:25.008
Thank you.

45:25.008 --> 45:26.153
You owe me.

45:26.153 --> 45:28.477
You're taking me out tonight,
your treat.

45:28.477 --> 45:32.446
So, go home, get some rest,
and come get me at 7:00.

45:32.646 --> 45:33.896
Fucking actors!

45:49.098 --> 45:52.598
I don't know,
this role feels different.

45:53.939 --> 45:57.356
Different, how?

45:58.010 --> 45:59.927
Like it's part of me.

46:00.822 --> 46:02.805
Like it was written for me.

46:02.805 --> 46:05.755
I know that sounds
completely pretentious.

46:06.755 --> 46:10.172
No, it makes perfect sense.

46:11.308 --> 46:14.433
We're a part of
something bigger now.

46:14.433 --> 46:16.035
Exactly, we're a part of something

46:16.035 --> 46:18.118
that's more than just us.

46:18.876 --> 46:22.321
And doesn't it, it feels amazing.

46:22.321 --> 46:23.568
Yes, like...

46:23.568 --> 46:26.160
Like we're taking charge.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.423
Like we're not just waiting around

46:28.423 --> 46:31.005
for someone to tell us
what to do anymore.

46:31.005 --> 46:34.119
Like this city is our bitch.

46:34.119 --> 46:38.119
Yes, I'm crazy, right?

46:38.986 --> 46:42.319
Negative, absolutely sane.

46:43.360 --> 46:46.053
Okay, I didn't want to tell you,

46:46.053 --> 46:49.936
but I have it on good authority

46:50.008 --> 46:52.011
that Crystal Force is going to be

46:52.011 --> 46:54.831
huge for the both of us.

46:54.831 --> 46:56.369
What do you mean?

46:56.369 --> 46:57.907
Did Jamal say something?

46:57.907 --> 46:59.972
Are we talking theatrical distribution?

46:59.972 --> 47:01.387
Sundance?

47:01.387 --> 47:04.755
No, I mean, I'm talking about something

47:04.755 --> 47:06.838
absolutely life changing.

47:08.121 --> 47:08.954
Tell me.

47:11.077 --> 47:14.708
Uh uh uh, you're gonna have to wait.

47:14.708 --> 47:16.643
But just for a little bit longer.

47:16.643 --> 47:18.226
Oh, I can't wait.

47:20.143 --> 47:22.032
Damn, why am I so wired?

47:22.032 --> 47:24.782
I feel like I could run
a marathon right now.

47:31.215 --> 47:32.194
Hey, you.

47:32.194 --> 47:32.627
Hey.

47:32.627 --> 47:33.710
Come on.

47:44.336 --> 47:50.653
Look who it is,
Will Tanner, aka Spanner.

47:50.715 --> 47:52.105
Hey, Will.

47:52.105 --> 47:54.771
Hey, ladies, nice to see you again.

47:54.771 --> 47:57.147
You ready to watch
the next Crystal Force movie?

47:57.147 --> 48:00.064
- Absolutely.
- Oh...

48:00.438 --> 48:03.031
Jamal sends his regrets.

48:03.031 --> 48:05.948
He's caught up in production again.

48:07.488 --> 48:08.563
It looks like we're gonna have

48:08.563 --> 48:12.529
to watch the movie without him, or not.

48:12.529 --> 48:17.196
Yeah, you guys are fun, I think.

48:17.794 --> 48:18.627
Eww.

48:19.467 --> 48:24.634
Or different idea, we can watch
a separate Crystal Force.

48:26.472 --> 48:29.063
I was just kidding, obviously.

48:29.063 --> 48:31.222
I mean, unless you're into it.

48:31.222 --> 48:34.055
I wouldn't be joking at all, then.

48:34.693 --> 48:39.610
And scene, okay, guys, movie time.

48:41.150 --> 48:42.450
I've already seen this one.

48:42.450 --> 48:45.700
So, I can go grab
some snacks or drinks.

48:46.747 --> 48:47.580
Beer?

48:47.980 --> 48:48.952
Check.

48:48.952 --> 48:50.627
Wine, red.

48:50.627 --> 48:52.688
Check and chuck.

48:52.688 --> 48:54.688
I'll be back in a flash.

48:58.703 --> 49:02.534
Thank God, she's gone, am I right?

49:02.734 --> 49:04.575
Hey, no punching.

49:04.575 --> 49:06.825
Watch the movie, dumb ass.

49:55.869 --> 49:57.909
Oh, my God, Garner,

49:57.909 --> 49:59.845
- I can't, even, with you right now.
- Shhh.

49:59.845 --> 50:00.928
Keep it down.

50:00.928 --> 50:01.779
Why?

50:02.179 --> 50:03.404
He's not here.

50:03.404 --> 50:05.487
He's at Sharon's watching a DVD.

50:05.487 --> 50:07.030
Which is where we should be,
instead of

50:07.030 --> 50:09.027
at the production office.

50:09.027 --> 50:09.860
Would you keep it down?

50:09.860 --> 50:12.021
The people on the street
are gonna hear us.

50:12.021 --> 50:14.980
And we're gonna get arrested
for breaking and entering.

50:14.980 --> 50:16.145
I need to go through this stuff

50:16.145 --> 50:19.023
so, I can prove the Crystal Force curse.

50:19.023 --> 50:22.478
Uh, first of all, we're not
breaking and entering anything.

50:22.478 --> 50:23.693
I have the key.

50:23.693 --> 50:25.294
I'm the associate producer.

50:25.294 --> 50:30.775
- And secondly, there is no Crystal Force curse.
- Shhh. Aha!

50:35.958 --> 50:39.125
Oh, my God, you found it.

50:39.324 --> 50:42.407
Garner, you found a prop.

50:47.476 --> 50:50.726
Really, then how do you explain this?

50:53.548 --> 50:54.784
Each name at the top of the page

50:54.784 --> 50:56.553
is the name of an actor
that has disappeared

50:56.553 --> 50:58.970
from the Crystal Force films.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.375
You're the one.

51:34.375 --> 51:36.931
You bet I am.

52:28.969 --> 52:37.636
- God, Kaley. Oh, yes, yes.
- Oh...

53:25.875 --> 53:26.708
Awkward.

53:27.811 --> 53:28.728
Ah, yeah.

53:32.707 --> 53:34.337
And they're done in red ink.

53:34.337 --> 53:36.667
Which you think is?

53:36.667 --> 53:38.306
Blood.

53:38.506 --> 53:41.110
That's what I thought.

53:41.110 --> 53:42.303
This book is full of drawings

53:42.303 --> 53:43.511
made of actors that have disappeared

53:43.511 --> 53:45.507
from the Crystal Force films.

53:45.507 --> 53:47.476
And what makes
you think that this is blood?

53:47.476 --> 53:49.315
That's what witches do.

53:49.515 --> 53:50.992
Jesus Christ, Garner!

53:50.992 --> 53:52.218
Do you know that the prop department

53:52.218 --> 53:53.490
is gonna come in their pants,

53:53.490 --> 53:54.879
when they realize that you thought

53:54.879 --> 53:56.684
this thing was real?

53:56.684 --> 53:58.170
It's just a fun little thing,

53:58.170 --> 53:59.678
that they write
the names of the actors

53:59.678 --> 54:02.258
from the past films in,
that we know about,

54:02.258 --> 54:03.635
but nobody else knows about,

54:03.635 --> 54:07.318
so we can talk about it on
the DVD commentary track.

54:07.318 --> 54:10.290
Really, then how do you explain this?

54:17.384 --> 54:18.479
Whoa.

54:18.479 --> 54:19.475
You see that?

54:19.675 --> 54:21.675
What the fuck is that?

54:30.070 --> 54:36.237
The Master will only let
the strongest serve the coven.

54:36.600 --> 54:40.285
All others will be slaughtered by Adul.

54:41.285 --> 54:45.057
Fight, fight for your right
to serve the coven.

54:45.057 --> 54:48.474
Fight for your right
to serve the Master.

54:51.225 --> 54:53.204
What's happened to me?

54:53.404 --> 54:56.154
The first Crystal Force movies,

54:57.377 --> 54:59.736
they were just an audition.

54:59.736 --> 55:05.653
And now, you're at
the call back for your life.

55:10.239 --> 55:12.822
I feel so strong.

55:13.001 --> 55:13.834
Yes.

55:14.980 --> 55:17.267
I feel like I could do anything.

55:17.267 --> 55:19.232
Yes!

55:19.232 --> 55:22.512
I feel like
the fucking executive producer.

55:22.512 --> 55:23.762
Yes!

55:25.860 --> 55:28.655
Sorry, Spanner, you're a nice guy,

55:28.655 --> 55:31.065
but the coven doesn't need
a character actor.

55:33.265 --> 55:35.098
Go Rose!

55:35.744 --> 55:36.944
You bitch!

55:57.524 --> 55:59.357
Go Spanner!

56:13.694 --> 56:15.743
Did you get a video of that, Sharon?

56:15.943 --> 56:17.693
Best fail video ever.

56:21.884 --> 56:25.139
You need better tag lights,
sweetheart.

56:25.139 --> 56:27.139
Wonderful job, Spanner.

56:28.475 --> 56:31.279
Master will be impressed.

56:31.279 --> 56:33.650
Now, finish her off.

56:33.650 --> 56:37.567
And then we'll go get some cold,
pressed juice.

56:39.779 --> 56:43.826
You know I never leave
my work unfinished.

56:43.826 --> 56:47.659
Hollywood could use
one less mediocre actress.

56:55.379 --> 56:57.405
And actor with hair plugs.

57:39.763 --> 57:44.527
You've done good work, ladies.

57:49.152 --> 57:51.918
The Master will be pleased.

57:51.918 --> 57:55.728
Thank you, Jamal.

57:55.728 --> 57:58.367
You're a credit to the coven.

57:58.367 --> 57:59.466
Thank you.

57:59.466 --> 58:00.299
Keep an eye out

58:00.299 --> 58:01.377
for your email, for the upcoming

58:01.377 --> 58:03.569
shoot schedule and call sheets.

58:03.569 --> 58:05.995
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

58:31.401 --> 58:32.408
I still don't understand

58:32.408 --> 58:33.714
why you haven't quit the movie,

58:33.714 --> 58:37.439
if you're so convinced Jamal
is some warlock mastermind.

58:37.439 --> 58:39.334
Because if he's some warlock mastermind

58:39.334 --> 58:41.211
I wanna be able to see him.

58:41.211 --> 58:42.560
If he's gonna use some ceremonial

58:42.560 --> 58:44.948
knife and use my blood as his ink,

58:44.948 --> 58:46.950
I want him to do it in my face.

58:46.950 --> 58:49.847
And if he's not,
you still want the credit.

58:49.847 --> 58:53.347
I'm a professional,
I made a commitment.

58:56.842 --> 58:57.977
Hello, actor people.

58:58.977 --> 59:02.383
Hey, there, looking forward to
our big scene today.

59:02.583 --> 59:03.351
I know, right?

59:03.351 --> 59:04.751
I love getting killed in horror movies.

59:04.751 --> 59:06.842
Except you don't get to
come back for the sequel.

59:06.842 --> 59:09.503
Not true, I was decapitated
in Heads will Roll,

59:09.503 --> 59:10.505
and they brought
me back as a living

59:10.505 --> 59:13.854
head in a jar,
for Heads will Roll Two, Giving Head.

59:13.854 --> 59:15.456
Nice.

59:15.456 --> 59:16.402
How about you, Garner?

59:16.402 --> 59:17.332
You ready to act the shit out of

59:17.332 --> 59:19.054
some shady witch business today?

59:19.054 --> 59:20.538
It's sure a shame
Greta has to miss it though.

59:20.538 --> 59:21.682
Garner!

59:21.682 --> 59:23.002
Greta?

59:23.402 --> 59:25.900
Yes, she was originally in this scene.

59:25.900 --> 59:26.733
Was she?

59:26.742 --> 59:27.882
I don't remember that.

59:27.882 --> 59:29.879
I thought they weren't
bringing her back for the sequel?

59:29.879 --> 59:32.563
You don't remember her
at the table read?

59:32.563 --> 59:34.143
There were like, 12 people there.

59:34.143 --> 59:35.520
I would have remembered.

59:35.520 --> 59:36.939
Are you fucking with me?

59:36.939 --> 59:39.058
No, just be careful in there.

59:39.058 --> 59:41.062
Of course, wait, what?

59:41.062 --> 59:42.290
What's up with you?

59:42.290 --> 59:43.222
I'm just saying that there might

59:43.222 --> 59:45.626
be a certain force in the studio.

59:45.626 --> 59:48.383
And I just want you to watch your back.

59:48.383 --> 59:50.170
Is this some character thing
he's doing?

59:50.170 --> 59:52.420
I can't even.

59:54.905 --> 59:56.659
Hello, stars.

59:56.659 --> 59:59.109
- Hey, Jamal.
- Hey, Jamal.

59:59.109 --> 01:00:00.942
I think we're ready
to rehearse this scene.

01:00:00.942 --> 01:00:02.025
Come on back.

01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:18.679
All right, welcome to set.

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:19.596
Come on in.

01:00:20.836 --> 01:00:23.536
Wow, this looks familiar.

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:27.933
Yes, we saved the set
from Crystal Force 14.

01:00:27.933 --> 01:00:29.536
A total Roger Korman move.

01:00:29.536 --> 01:00:32.203
Oh, thrifty, nice.

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:35.385
All right, so let's have you

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:39.552
- step up over here, hop up.
- Up.

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:47.054
Are you comfy?

01:00:47.054 --> 01:00:48.165
- Yep.
- All right.

01:00:48.165 --> 01:00:49.391
Okay, now on the day that we film

01:00:49.391 --> 01:00:51.345
we're gonna strap you
in this puppy.

01:00:51.345 --> 01:00:53.012
But we know you're used to that.

01:00:56.213 --> 01:00:59.546
Garner, you get the big toy.

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.995
Isn't this the cheese knife
from craft services?

01:01:02.995 --> 01:01:06.030
Yes, but it's the evil cheese knife

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.686
from craft services.

01:01:10.755 --> 01:01:11.756
Okay, so we're gonna rehearse this

01:01:11.756 --> 01:01:13.111
from the top of the scene.

01:01:13.111 --> 01:01:15.142
Uh, Lutz, you don't come in
until page two.

01:01:15.142 --> 01:01:16.746
So, sit this one out for a little bit.

01:01:16.746 --> 01:01:17.741
You got it, boss.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:18.747
All right, awesome.

01:01:18.747 --> 01:01:20.691
I'm gonna start from
the top of the third act.

01:01:20.691 --> 01:01:21.930
Now, I know you guys
know where that is

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:23.554
because you are professionals.

01:01:23.554 --> 01:01:26.257
And you studied your scripts,
like good little actors.

01:01:26.457 --> 01:01:27.450
Yes, Jamal.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.091
So, Detective Donahue,

01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:31.047
you have been possessed by
the evil Master,

01:01:31.047 --> 01:01:33.251
who is also the leader of the coven.

01:01:33.251 --> 01:01:37.001
Now, he is about to
sacrifice this young lady.

01:01:38.627 --> 01:01:41.937
Who has been kidnapped by
the coven.

01:01:41.937 --> 01:01:45.215
But not before Detective Donahue
comes in

01:01:45.215 --> 01:01:47.395
and snaps him out.

01:01:47.795 --> 01:01:49.706
Right, keep the energy up.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.373
And let's rehearse this one out.

01:01:54.529 --> 01:01:56.979
Detective, stop, it's me.

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.279
If you're still in there,

01:01:58.279 --> 01:02:02.529
if the real Detective Gilmore
can still hear me, don't do this.

01:02:02.529 --> 01:02:04.946
Fight it, detective, fight it.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:11.623
How dare you talk to me
in that manner.

01:02:11.623 --> 01:02:14.487
I am no mortal,
I am no man of flesh,

01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:15.655
and blood, and mercy.

01:02:15.655 --> 01:02:17.955
And your please are useless.

01:02:17.955 --> 01:02:19.660
Wait, what's going on?

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.051
What happened to the lights?

01:02:21.051 --> 01:02:21.884
Jamal?

01:02:22.882 --> 01:02:25.965
There is no Jamal, only the Master.

01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:29.754
Garner, what are you doing?

01:02:29.754 --> 01:02:32.351
Oh, my God,
what happened to your eyes?

01:02:33.351 --> 01:02:37.031
I finally see a groveling whore,
I finally see.

01:02:38.031 --> 01:02:39.987
Jamal, this isn't funny.

01:02:39.987 --> 01:02:41.752
I don't need you scaring
the shit out of me.

01:02:41.752 --> 01:02:44.112
I'm not a method actress.

01:02:44.112 --> 01:02:47.275
Your pathetic cries
nurture my dark soul, whore.

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:48.971
Your tears quench my thirst.

01:02:48.971 --> 01:02:52.965
And your blood will nurture our coven.

01:02:52.965 --> 01:02:55.924
Garner, stop, seriously stop.

01:02:56.124 --> 01:02:57.919
I don't know what
Jamal put you up to,

01:02:57.919 --> 01:02:59.669
but this isn't funny.

01:03:10.474 --> 01:03:11.307
No!

01:03:58.926 --> 01:04:03.343
Hey, time to go, nice work today.

01:04:03.425 --> 01:04:05.516
Wait, Lutz, what's going on?

01:04:05.516 --> 01:04:07.142
What do you mean?

01:04:07.142 --> 01:04:09.825
Well, I don't remember.

01:04:09.865 --> 01:04:11.290
Spit it out, Stanley Stutter.

01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:13.373
I have a class to get to.

01:04:14.605 --> 01:04:15.855
Where's Tara?

01:04:17.313 --> 01:04:21.182
Home, I assume,
she left a couple hours ago.

01:04:21.382 --> 01:04:23.575
Come on, move it.

01:04:23.575 --> 01:04:26.028
Jamal asked me to lock up.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.608
Actually I got to pull
some stuff together,

01:04:27.608 --> 01:04:29.559
I wrap some of my wardrobe.

01:04:29.559 --> 01:04:30.525
I just lock it, right?

01:04:30.525 --> 01:04:33.084
Or will it lock up behind me
when I leave?

01:04:33.084 --> 01:04:35.147
Sure, just make sure

01:04:35.147 --> 01:04:37.023
and check it
before you walk away.

01:04:37.023 --> 01:04:39.109
Jamal will shit a brick,

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:41.279
if he finds out
it was unlocked overnight.

01:04:41.279 --> 01:04:42.302
Got it.

01:04:42.302 --> 01:04:43.135
Later.

01:05:36.684 --> 01:05:38.028
Hey, Patrick, what's up?

01:05:38.228 --> 01:05:41.553
I was just about to
ask you the same thing.

01:05:41.553 --> 01:05:42.859
Didn't you guys wrap an hour ago?

01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:44.801
Oh, yeah, man, long day.

01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:46.975
Just wanted to come in here
and chill out for a little bit.

01:05:46.975 --> 01:05:49.730
And then I realized that
I forgot tomorrow's call sheet.

01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:52.689
So, I came in here to grab one.

01:05:52.689 --> 01:05:54.929
Doesn't Jamal email them
during lunch each day?

01:05:54.929 --> 01:05:57.440
Yeah, man, it's like,

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.289
you know, it sucks,
those spam filters.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.228
You know man, they just like,

01:06:01.228 --> 01:06:04.771
so, I just, what brings you in here?

01:06:04.771 --> 01:06:07.369
Well, I'm an associate producer.

01:06:07.369 --> 01:06:09.490
You're the associate producer too?

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:11.399
I have certain skills
that are useful

01:06:11.399 --> 01:06:13.422
for productions like this.

01:06:13.422 --> 01:06:15.905
Jamal just lucked out
when he cast me, I guess.

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.822
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

01:06:19.499 --> 01:06:20.673
Well, you know, I just came in

01:06:20.673 --> 01:06:22.371
to jump on some stuff for tomorrow,

01:06:22.371 --> 01:06:24.859
while it's quiet in here.

01:06:24.859 --> 01:06:30.926
Mmm, okay, uh, you know man,
it's been a long day.

01:06:30.981 --> 01:06:33.148
So, I'm gonna hit the road.

01:06:34.259 --> 01:06:36.244
You know, I'll see you later man.

01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:37.170
Have a good one.

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:38.670
Have a good one.

01:06:57.554 --> 01:07:00.271
Hey, Garner, what now?

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.069
Did you catch Jamal killing a goat

01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:04.069
in a pentagram,
while drinking a virgin's blood?

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.692
Hey, Lutz, you know that Patrick guy?

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.701
Samuel replacement?

01:07:11.701 --> 01:07:15.160
Only that he's fucking gorgeous.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.898
Yeah, he's the associate producer

01:07:16.898 --> 01:07:19.195
of Crystal Force 16 Freshman Year.

01:07:19.195 --> 01:07:22.426
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:22.426 --> 01:07:26.593
Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill Jamal.

01:07:26.634 --> 01:07:28.509
My agent got me that credit

01:07:28.509 --> 01:07:32.459
because he's still paying me shit,
after all these films.

01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:35.012
And then, I made him give me a key

01:07:35.012 --> 01:07:37.939
because an AP should have a key, right?

01:07:37.939 --> 01:07:41.269
I mean, yes, I might wanna have sex

01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:44.062
on that set sometime, but still.

01:07:44.062 --> 01:07:45.525
Lutz.

01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:48.693
What did this guy do
to get an AP credit?

01:07:48.693 --> 01:07:52.146
He said he had quote,
"Certain skills."

01:07:52.146 --> 01:07:55.813
Holy shit, he's blowing Jamal.

01:07:56.357 --> 01:07:59.293
I had no idea that guy was gay.

01:07:59.293 --> 01:08:00.781
But that's not the big news.

01:08:00.781 --> 01:08:03.677
That's pretty big news.

01:08:03.677 --> 01:08:05.965
I took the leather book
from the office.

01:08:05.965 --> 01:08:07.233
What?

01:08:07.233 --> 01:08:09.587
I took the leather book from the office

01:08:09.587 --> 01:08:11.766
and there's a new drawing in there.

01:08:11.766 --> 01:08:14.077
And you know who's name is
at the top of the page?

01:08:14.277 --> 01:08:15.221
Tara's.

01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:17.638
Why did you take that book?

01:08:20.533 --> 01:08:25.701
Garner, you need to take
that book back, seriously.

01:08:26.692 --> 01:08:30.192
You need to take the book
back to the set.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.982
So, you believe me now.

01:08:41.982 --> 01:08:43.430
Give me that!

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.934
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

01:08:45.934 --> 01:08:47.031
Alex, that's evidence.

01:08:47.031 --> 01:08:48.913
We need to take it to the police.

01:08:49.113 --> 01:08:50.375
And do what?

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:52.060
Tell them that the cast of a long,

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.564
running, direct to video horror franchise

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:57.991
is being murdered, one by one,
by the executive producer?

01:08:57.991 --> 01:08:59.631
Something like that.

01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:02.557
Because that works so well
in the Crystal Force films.

01:09:02.557 --> 01:09:04.243
Why are you so worked up over
this book?

01:09:04.243 --> 01:09:06.566
Yesterday, you were treating it
as a prop.

01:09:06.566 --> 01:09:10.341
It is a prop,
a very important prop.

01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:11.269
I knew that.

01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:13.037
You didn't know it.

01:09:13.037 --> 01:09:17.037
This is a prop, but it isn't a book.

01:09:17.656 --> 01:09:18.488
What?

01:09:19.568 --> 01:09:23.068
This is a demon.

01:09:24.345 --> 01:09:25.334
A demon, as in?

01:09:25.334 --> 01:09:29.474
Yes, and this building
is a gateway to Hades.

01:09:29.474 --> 01:09:32.904
You mean this yoga studio
is a gateway to hell.

01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:35.307
Okay, when you say it
like that it sounds dumb,

01:09:35.307 --> 01:09:36.474
but it's true.

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:38.881
Back up.

01:09:38.881 --> 01:09:40.715
If you'd really done your research,

01:09:40.715 --> 01:09:41.816
you would have realized that

01:09:41.816 --> 01:09:44.327
this piece of land
was used as a location

01:09:44.327 --> 01:09:47.238
in every single Crystal Force film.

01:09:47.238 --> 01:09:49.866
And before that,
it was the location

01:09:49.866 --> 01:09:52.152
of a gruesome,
ritual murder by students

01:09:52.152 --> 01:09:54.002
of the black arts.

01:09:54.002 --> 01:09:56.609
And this book, as you call it,

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:58.226
was born in this building.

01:09:59.169 --> 01:10:00.945
The cover is the flesh
of a day player

01:10:00.945 --> 01:10:03.071
on the first Crystal Force film.

01:10:03.071 --> 01:10:07.456
The blood of all the actors
adorns all its pages.

01:10:07.456 --> 01:10:09.107
Their souls are embedded in the earth

01:10:09.107 --> 01:10:10.275
beneath this building.

01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:14.462
And in the walls,
and between the covers of this book.

01:10:14.462 --> 01:10:16.212
We have to return it.

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:19.640
How do you know all this?

01:10:26.729 --> 01:10:29.713
Because I'm the fucking Master,
that's why.

01:10:29.713 --> 01:10:31.380
You're the Master?

01:10:32.684 --> 01:10:36.215
Didn't you wonder why
I was in so many of these movies?

01:10:36.815 --> 01:10:38.224
You're the Master?

01:10:39.224 --> 01:10:40.825
Why are you asking me like that?

01:10:40.825 --> 01:10:42.820
Because I'm a woman?

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.040
No, because you're
the associate producer.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.102
Oh, oh, no, that's just a fake title

01:10:49.102 --> 01:10:51.212
to keep people off my trail.

01:10:51.212 --> 01:10:53.501
I know, you killed Samuel,
you killed Greta,

01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:54.657
and you killed Tara.

01:10:54.657 --> 01:10:56.144
And Spanner.

01:10:56.144 --> 01:10:57.907
Holy shit.

01:10:57.907 --> 01:11:00.171
Well, not hands on.

01:11:00.171 --> 01:11:04.208
My minion, Jamal,
here did most of the dirty work.

01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:05.990
And Sharon and Rose helped.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:08.573
And of course, Ivan, and Brian.

01:11:10.282 --> 01:11:11.115
But why?

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:16.518
The dark arts have
a firm grip on Hollywood, my friend.

01:11:16.518 --> 01:11:19.310
There are thousands
of magic practitioners

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:25.060
all through Los Angeles
and, ugh, the Valley.

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:28.343
The Valley witches are the worst.

01:11:28.343 --> 01:11:33.152
Agreed, our coven is
one of the strongest.

01:11:33.152 --> 01:11:36.686
But still too weak to
really control the region.

01:11:36.686 --> 01:11:39.849
So, tonight, courtesy of this book,

01:11:39.849 --> 01:11:44.032
and your soul,
we are going to

01:11:44.095 --> 01:11:49.455
awaken the dark powers of
every unsuspecting witch within 10 miles.

01:11:49.655 --> 01:11:51.025
To what end?

01:11:51.025 --> 01:11:53.726
We're going to build a witch army.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.444
And then we're going to
take over this town.

01:11:56.444 --> 01:12:00.841
And we're gonna rule it
in true Hollywood style,

01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:02.262
from the studios.

01:12:02.262 --> 01:12:04.218
You're insane.

01:12:04.218 --> 01:12:07.801
Um, I prefer creative genius.

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:12.689
Jamal, bind his feet to the floor.

01:12:13.635 --> 01:12:16.485
Alex, don't, we're friends.

01:12:16.685 --> 01:12:18.055
Are we?

01:12:18.055 --> 01:12:20.722
I would say we're more friendly.

01:12:21.583 --> 01:12:26.166
Enough, Jamal, take your place.

01:12:27.964 --> 01:12:32.047
And we begin.

01:13:25.543 --> 01:13:27.346
Can you feel that?

01:13:27.346 --> 01:13:30.096
It worked, it worked.

01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:56.782
What the hell?

01:13:56.782 --> 01:13:58.518
Who did that?

01:13:58.518 --> 01:14:00.310
Who did that?

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:03.060
Who killed my minion?

01:14:11.237 --> 01:14:12.404
Hello, Lutz.

01:14:14.019 --> 01:14:15.917
Are you kidding me?

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:17.437
I knew you were the Master.

01:14:17.437 --> 01:14:18.794
I totally called that one.

01:14:18.794 --> 01:14:20.936
Oh, my God, liar!

01:14:20.936 --> 01:14:23.936
You so thought it was Ivan, that DP.

01:14:25.352 --> 01:14:28.981
Yes, I'm the Master,
and who are you?

01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:30.522
I am the Master.

01:14:30.722 --> 01:14:31.805
Impossible.

01:14:32.595 --> 01:14:34.753
Just like an actress.

01:14:34.753 --> 01:14:36.349
All covens have Masters.

01:14:36.349 --> 01:14:38.554
I am the Orange County Master.

01:14:38.754 --> 01:14:43.139
We control everything outside
of Los Angeles County.

01:14:43.139 --> 01:14:46.722
And I'm here to add
Hollywood to that list.

01:14:48.065 --> 01:14:51.862
And what are you two dumb asses doing?

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:52.945
I turned you.

01:14:54.046 --> 01:14:56.698
What, are you gonna tell me
that you're his now?

01:14:57.698 --> 01:14:59.686
Don't call me a dumb ass.

01:14:59.686 --> 01:15:01.540
I'm a witch now too.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.983
I have powers.

01:15:11.366 --> 01:15:12.743
Sharon?

01:15:13.143 --> 01:15:14.893
I belong to no one.

01:15:16.723 --> 01:15:23.890
I'm with Patrick, because,
well, he's the strongest.

01:15:26.638 --> 01:15:28.693
We'll see about that.

01:15:31.757 --> 01:15:34.753
You may be the Orange County Master

01:15:34.753 --> 01:15:37.991
but we do things differently,
here in the big city.

01:15:41.097 --> 01:15:42.840
There's an order to things.

01:16:04.568 --> 01:16:08.401
Good effort,
Orange County Master.

01:16:08.849 --> 01:16:11.362
It's nice to see
we have such talent

01:16:11.362 --> 01:16:14.445
for the supporting roles.

01:16:21.272 --> 01:16:23.855
It's three against to one, Lutz.

01:16:30.376 --> 01:16:33.171
You're right, you did make me.

01:16:33.571 --> 01:16:37.059
But that means I'm just as powerful.

01:16:39.474 --> 01:16:41.256
God damn it.

01:16:41.456 --> 01:16:45.559
And there's one other thing,
I'm younger.

01:16:49.507 --> 01:16:51.268
What are you doing?

01:16:51.268 --> 01:16:53.185
How did you learn that?

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:58.683
Aw, Patrick taught me.

01:16:58.683 --> 01:17:00.370
She's a quick study.

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:02.597
I see big things for her.

01:17:02.597 --> 01:17:04.930
Uh-huh, thank you.

01:17:07.065 --> 01:17:10.148
Now, let's finish this.

01:17:12.592 --> 01:17:16.425
No, don't, you don't know
what you're doing.

01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.607
Patrick, you can stop this.

01:17:28.956 --> 01:17:32.292
And that's a wrap, on the Master.

01:17:32.292 --> 01:17:35.330
Hmm. What do we do now?

01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:38.163
Take over Hollywood.

01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:41.273
Oh, my God,
this is so exciting.

01:17:41.273 --> 01:17:43.443
Yeah, but what are we gonna do

01:17:43.443 --> 01:17:45.209
about all the witches and warlocks

01:17:45.209 --> 01:17:47.280
that were affected by Lutz's spell?

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.085
They'll find their way to us,
don't worry.

01:17:55.933 --> 01:17:56.886
Patrick what's going on?

01:17:56.886 --> 01:17:58.136
I don't know.

01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:08.288
Lutz, oh, my God,
thank God, you're okay.

01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:14.216
Okay, I know the box was overkill.

01:18:14.216 --> 01:18:18.299
I was just trying to impress Patrick, huh.

01:18:27.491 --> 01:18:31.058
So, here we are, alone at last.

01:18:31.067 --> 01:18:36.134
Apparently, we seem to
have lost all of our minions.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.671
I can always send out
another casting call.

01:18:40.671 --> 01:18:43.491
One great thing about Hollywood,

01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:47.155
minions are an endlessly
renewable resource.

01:18:48.525 --> 01:18:51.025
Spoken like a true producer.

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:54.395
Now, back to work.

01:19:05.302 --> 01:19:10.452
Enough, we're obviously equal in power.

01:19:11.007 --> 01:19:13.953
There's no reason we should fight.

01:19:13.953 --> 01:19:16.359
What we should be doing
is working together.

01:19:16.359 --> 01:19:19.259
The Los Angeles coven and
the Orange County coven?

01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:22.044
When was the last time anybody from LA

01:19:22.044 --> 01:19:24.860
had anything good to say
about the Orange County?

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.586
As they say,
"Keep your friends close."

01:19:28.786 --> 01:19:31.614
We have a whole city full of witches

01:19:31.614 --> 01:19:34.798
and warlocks to bring into the fold.

01:19:34.798 --> 01:19:39.565
Our dark arts army will be too big
for only one Master.

01:19:39.607 --> 01:19:41.084
Keep talking.

01:19:41.484 --> 01:19:44.618
Besides, I'll need help recasting

01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:48.451
and re-crewing
Crystal Force 16 Freshman Year.

01:19:53.184 --> 01:19:54.576
What's my credit?

01:19:55.176 --> 01:19:58.805
Above the title cast,
producer credit, no points.

01:19:59.005 --> 01:19:59.838
What?

01:19:59.899 --> 01:20:01.066
Prove yourself on this one

01:20:01.066 --> 01:20:03.269
and we'll offer you points
on the next one.

01:20:03.269 --> 01:20:05.548
If I survive the next one.

01:20:05.548 --> 01:20:07.258
Unfortunately, story may dictate

01:20:07.258 --> 01:20:09.925
that you do not make the sequel.

01:20:12.176 --> 01:20:14.247
I guess I'll take my chances.

01:20:14.847 --> 01:20:17.183
At least something for my reel.

01:20:17.183 --> 01:20:18.016
Deal.

01:20:22.721 --> 01:20:24.646
By the way, you do realize,

01:20:24.646 --> 01:20:27.422
killing Jamal has set us
back even further?

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:30.866
Now we have to find a warlock
that knows how to direct.

01:20:30.866 --> 01:20:33.282
Hmmm, how about demons.

01:20:34.282 --> 01:20:37.449
Sadly, they tend to kill the extras.

01:20:39.235 --> 01:20:41.068
Let's go have a drink.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:48.330
