WEBVTT

01:53.697 --> 01:55.531
Thank you, Edward.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.034
Sister.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.379
Yes, and fair.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.385
-Lady Jane.
-Yes.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.892
Her Majesty is just coming.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.687
You are not to speak anything to her
until you are invited to.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.024
Yes.

02:32.069 --> 02:36.906
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

02:45.249 --> 02:49.085
Mistress Seymour, will you place
your hand upon this Holy Bible?

02:49.253 --> 02:52.713
And will you promise and swear
to serve Her Majesty Queen Anne...

02:52.881 --> 02:55.591
...faithfully, honourably
and discreetly?

02:55.759 --> 02:59.136
And will you promise and swear that
your conduct will always be modest...

02:59.304 --> 03:05.059
...virtuous and good, presenting at all
times a godly spectacle to others?

03:05.269 --> 03:08.396
I do so promise and swear.

03:33.797 --> 03:34.797
Lady Jane.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.301
Your Majesty.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.320
The king.

03:59.323 --> 04:06.662
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.334
Mr. Secretary.

04:17.633 --> 04:21.010
I managed, with some difficulty,
to obtain a copy of the secret report...

04:21.178 --> 04:23.554
-...of the autopsy on Catherine.
-What was discovered?

04:23.722 --> 04:26.849
That most of the internal organs
were normal except for the heart...

04:27.017 --> 04:30.019
...which had a black growth,
all hideous to behold...

04:30.187 --> 04:32.355
...which clung closely to the outside.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.023
What could've caused it?

04:34.191 --> 04:37.026
Her doctor,
whom l trust completely...

04:37.194 --> 04:40.196
...told me that such a growth
was consistent...

04:40.364 --> 04:42.698
...with the evidence of poisoning.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.411
Had the body been properly examined,
traces of it would have been seen.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.539
Poor Catherine.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.916
No.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.627
There is little need to pray for her.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.838
Her holy soul is in eternal rest.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.883
But l worry for her daughter.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.218
Poor Mary.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.057
We shall talk later.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.739
Excellency.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.408
Your Majesty.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.785
I hear your master
is to be congratulated.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.954
He has taken Tunis from the Turks.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.540
Your Majesty is very well informed.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.417
The threat of the Turkish invasion...

05:34.584 --> 05:37.545
...has indeed been lifted
by the emperor's victory.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.131
-Majesty.
-Peace will follow.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.926
-Would that it followed everywhere.
-Yes, pray God.

05:44.094 --> 05:48.097
Perhaps one day there will be
no more need for war or war's alarms.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.598
Your Majesty.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.559
In the meantime...

05:51.935 --> 05:55.604
...please convey my love and
my congratulations to the emperor.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.440
Tell him that....

05:59.317 --> 06:02.403
Tell him that
of all the princes in the world...

06:02.779 --> 06:05.114
...l admire him the most.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.616
Cromwell.

06:24.009 --> 06:28.304
Now the emperor's defeated the Turks,
his armies are freed to turn upon us.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.182
And a while ago,
I swear he would've done so.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.808
But no longer.

06:33.602 --> 06:37.271
With Catherine's death, the cause
of our enmity is altogether taken away.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.941
And l have a new desire
to renew my friendship with him.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.652
You will talk to Chapuys.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.155
You will find out
the cost of friendship.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.823
Yes, Your Majesty.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.867
What of our reforms?

06:50.035 --> 06:52.661
The bill for the dissolution
of the larger monasteries...

06:52.829 --> 06:54.830
...will be laid before Parliament.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.374
Good. Mr. Cromwell.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.835
Majesty.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.171
Oh, there was something else.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.340
I understand
you have a wife and son.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.467
Yes.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.011
What's your son's name?

07:09.805 --> 07:11.347
Gregory.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.851
I had two daughters also...

07:19.189 --> 07:20.689
...but they died.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.322
You will bring your wife and son
to court.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.574
I should like to meet them.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.036
Yes, Majesty.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.944
Your Majesty.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.239
If Your Majesty will follow me.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.231
Good people...

08:44.733 --> 08:46.442
...welcome.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.486
Here is the Queen's Majesty come...

08:49.654 --> 08:54.450
...this Maundy Thursday,
to give you alms and wash your feet.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.160
-God bless you.
-God bless you.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.079
God believe you.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.291
-God bless you.
-Your Majesty.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.085
God bless you.
God in his mercy bless you.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.756
God in his mercy
bless and keep you.

09:10.300 --> 09:14.470
Will you look? This is twice as much
as the old queen gave.

09:14.638 --> 09:17.306
-God bless you.
-God bless you.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.651
From Queen Anne.

09:33.949 --> 09:38.827
Holiness, His Royal Highness,
the King of France.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.499
Majesty.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.879
You come to us
as a pilgrim and a penitent.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.341
Surely you deserve
heaven's graces.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.560
With all my heart,
I welcome you to Rome.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.522
-Holiness.
-The mother of our Church.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.191
When others fall by the wayside...

10:09.359 --> 10:13.028
...through vanity, avarice or lust...

10:13.196 --> 10:16.198
...you remain loyal to us...

10:16.366 --> 10:18.701
...and to the truth of Christ.

10:19.369 --> 10:23.497
As a child to a father,
I say to you here...

10:23.665 --> 10:28.252
...in the presence of all these princes
of our Holy Church...

10:28.461 --> 10:33.882
...that l would gladly lay down my life
in order to serve you...

10:34.217 --> 10:36.677
...in whatever way you choose.

10:41.725 --> 10:46.061
I have decided to carry out
the bull of excommunication...

10:46.229 --> 10:49.189
...against King Henry of England.

10:50.025 --> 10:54.069
A father must always seek for ways
to forgive his children...

10:54.696 --> 10:59.241
...but Henry's crimes against us
and against our faith...

10:59.409 --> 11:02.077
...are too profound to forgive.

11:02.245 --> 11:07.082
Moreover, he shows no repentance,
no contrition.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.376
It's true.

11:09.544 --> 11:12.880
The King of England has always been
the most difficult friend...

11:13.048 --> 11:17.092
...to bear in the world.
He is continuously capricious.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.428
In which case...

11:19.596 --> 11:24.099
...l am sure l can rely upon you
to execute the bull.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.936
-Holiness?
-My son...

11:28.271 --> 11:30.606
...surely you realise...

11:31.066 --> 11:34.943
...if I excommunicate
a fellow prince...

11:35.278 --> 11:39.490
...then that prince
is not only separated from God...

11:39.657 --> 11:43.786
...but also from the communion
of the faithful.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.789
His rule becomes invalid.

11:46.956 --> 11:51.251
And it is a religious imperative
to overthrow him.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.963
You are a great Catholic prince.

11:55.298 --> 11:59.468
You have armies, you have ships,
you have guns.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.971
So l ask you, in all humility...

12:03.139 --> 12:05.933
...as your Holy Father...

12:06.976 --> 12:08.852
...will you invade England?

12:10.271 --> 12:14.483
Will you remove
and kill the apostate...

12:14.776 --> 12:18.987
...and will you return that country
to our common faith?

12:37.674 --> 12:40.384
The Seymours are an old
and interesting family.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.680
Sir John fought beside the king
during his French campaign.

12:44.848 --> 12:48.892
He also has two sons,
Edward and Thomas.

12:49.102 --> 12:53.689
I hear the first is steady and cold,
the other rash.

12:53.857 --> 12:57.693
But both are ambitious and greedy.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.195
Though they have all
taken the oath...

13:00.363 --> 13:03.157
...what is not yet known
is how honestly and completely...

13:03.324 --> 13:05.367
...they have renounced
the old religion.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.079
It is something we must hope,
before long, to discover.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.998
And if we can?

13:11.166 --> 13:17.254
Then the tide of their ambitions
can be turned and will ebb away...

13:17.422 --> 13:20.549
...and we shall hear
no more of them.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.558
His Excellency,
the imperial ambassador.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.687
Your Eminence.
You are most welcome.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.064
Please, be seated.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.401
You are most gracious,
Mr. Secretary.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.070
As l told you...

13:42.238 --> 13:46.450
...His Majesty is most desirous of
making an alliance with the emperor.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.578
I believe also
that such an alliance...

13:49.746 --> 13:52.706
...would be greatly to the benefit
of this country.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.045
I have communicated
with the emperor.

13:58.463 --> 14:02.758
He, also, is eager to find a way
to make a new and strong alliance.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.429
And to show his goodwill...

14:07.597 --> 14:11.600
...l can tell you that he is willing
to persuade His Holiness Pope Paul...

14:11.768 --> 14:15.270
...not to publish the sentence
of excommunication against the king...

14:16.564 --> 14:19.274
...which would have deprived him
of his throne.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.780
I am sure His Majesty would wish
to express his immense gratitude...

14:24.948 --> 14:26.073
...to your master.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.787
And in return?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.457
In the circumstances...

14:35.625 --> 14:39.962
...after the death of his beloved aunt,
Queen Catherine of England...

14:40.129 --> 14:43.465
...the emperor is prepared
to offer the king his support...

14:43.633 --> 14:46.301
...for the continuation
of his marriage to Anne Boleyn.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.305
But on condition...

14:50.473 --> 14:56.228
...that the king declare Princess Mary
to be his legitimate heir.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.745
I accept this is, in many ways...

15:14.664 --> 15:18.041
...a most generous concession
on behalf of the emperor.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.379
He begs the king to understand
it is as far as he is prepared to go.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.676
I'll certainly put your proposal
to His Majesty.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.470
With your approval?

15:36.352 --> 15:39.646
Even with my approval,
Excellency...

15:40.690 --> 15:43.025
...this may not be easy.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.875
-Oh, she's pretty.
-Who?

16:00.043 --> 16:02.044
Lady Jane Seymour.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.046
She's new at court.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.547
Here.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.177
If thou wilt mighty be,
Flee from the rage of cruel will;

16:10.345 --> 16:15.057
See thou keep thee free from
The foul yoke of sensual bondage

16:15.224 --> 16:18.060
"Foul yoke of sensual bondage."
I like that.

16:18.227 --> 16:22.564
Then you don't understand it.
How cruel the will that drives it.

16:24.567 --> 16:29.571
Until you see the fruits of sensual
bondage swinging from a rope, you....

16:36.329 --> 16:37.913
-Lady Jane Seymour?
-Yes?

16:38.081 --> 16:40.248
Forgive me,
for there is someone over here...

16:40.416 --> 16:44.753
...a friend who wishes
a word with you in private.

16:45.755 --> 16:49.091
-Which friend?
-This way, my lady.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.465
Jane.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.261
Your Majesty.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.030
I ask you only one thing.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.703
That you allow me to serve
and worship you...

17:59.996 --> 18:03.331
...as Lancelot served
and worshipped Guinevere.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.626
Sweet, gentle lady...

18:06.794 --> 18:08.670
...will you let me so?

18:17.180 --> 18:18.430
I will.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.021
May I kiss your hand?

18:43.539 --> 18:45.540
My lady.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.077
Do you know them?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.871
Who? Know who?

19:25.248 --> 19:26.414
The Seymours.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.293
I may have met Edward,
the eldest son.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.629
He's a cold fish.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.506
I don't know about the others.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.426
Are you afraid of them?

19:38.886 --> 19:41.888
Father thinks they may be
secret supporters of Mary.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.724
Mary, Mary.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.769
It's a pity she's not keeping
company with her mother.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.816
They tell me she's ill again.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.486
And that the king has given
permission for her removal...

19:56.654 --> 19:58.947
...from Elizabeth's household
for her comfort.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.575
It's an act of kindness,
no more than that.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.494
No. No, he's fond of her.

20:04.662 --> 20:08.748
He always was and he still is, though
he pretends differently to my face.

20:09.959 --> 20:13.670
-How ill is she?
-Very. So I'm told.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.798
With a fever and constant vomiting.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.551
Then with God's good grace...

20:19.760 --> 20:22.762
...we may not have to meddle
with her after all.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.615
-The king has offered to serve you?
-Yes, Father.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.283
I'm not surprised.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.495
And it means he does not seek
an easy conquest.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.872
He has formed an affection.

20:49.999 --> 20:54.085
What's important is that it should be
carefully and assiduously nurtured.

20:57.798 --> 21:02.010
I must urge you not to submit yourself
and yield your virginity to the king...

21:03.012 --> 21:05.180
...however forceful his persuasions.

21:06.015 --> 21:10.060
Jane does not need to be lectured
on the need for virtue or modesty...

21:10.227 --> 21:12.687
...when she possesses them
in her nature.

21:12.855 --> 21:17.400
Still, imagine what it would mean
for us as a family...

21:17.610 --> 21:20.654
...if he did grow to love her.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.907
I'm certainly aware
there are some at court...

21:24.116 --> 21:27.494
...who would like to see
the queen replaced.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.040
Well, wait, wait.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.625
I thought that--

21:36.045 --> 21:39.381
Are you saying that l should be queen
instead of her?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.427
Would you like to be?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.561
Tell me, Sir Henry...

21:53.729 --> 21:56.064
...are you engaged yet
to Lady Margaret?

21:56.232 --> 21:59.025
No, Your Majesty. l....

21:59.193 --> 22:02.070
I have not so far asked for her hand.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.280
Oh, for God's sakes, man.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.282
She's young.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.535
She's....

22:09.870 --> 22:12.580
She'll give you more children,
I know it.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.916
And l know it, Your Majesty...

22:15.084 --> 22:16.918
...but l was married before...

22:17.086 --> 22:20.755
...and l must confess, I rather like
the liberty of not being married again.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.469
That I can understand.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.394
You know what, Sir Henry?

22:35.938 --> 22:38.106
You're courting a young lady.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.607
And l'm....

22:45.906 --> 22:48.116
We should joust together again.

22:48.617 --> 22:49.951
As we used to.

22:50.119 --> 22:53.121
You always did grace the tiltyard.

22:53.456 --> 22:56.207
We ran many courses
against each other.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.126
Broke many lances.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.422
We should do it again.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.799
And you can organise it.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.634
Soon.

23:07.261 --> 23:09.012
Majesty.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.828
Oh, sweetheart. What is it?

23:33.996 --> 23:35.830
Where have you been?

23:36.499 --> 23:39.793
I told you. I had meetings.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.669
Privy Council matters.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.839
-Until this hour?
-Yes.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.675
The king's affairs never sleep.

23:48.052 --> 23:51.763
And what of your affairs?

23:52.515 --> 23:54.557
My affairs?

23:57.978 --> 23:59.854
You have just come
from another's bed.

24:00.022 --> 24:03.525
No. Do not deny it.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.196
Very well, I shan't.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.745
What makes it worse
is that you've not forsaken my bed...

24:15.913 --> 24:17.872
...for that of another woman.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.380
But for another man.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.222
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

24:34.390 --> 24:35.723
Oh, my God, it's true.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.893
Oh, my God.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.896
It's disgusting. lt's a sin.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.399
It's a sin against God.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.693
It's a sin against nature.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.572
All those who practise it
are condemned by the Gospels...

24:50.739 --> 24:53.074
...to live forever in purgatory.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.243
Sometimes, my love...

24:56.078 --> 24:57.537
...l think that with you...

24:58.122 --> 25:01.416
...l'm already condemned
to live in purgatory.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.768
The Duke of Suffolk
has entered the list...

25:20.936 --> 25:23.938
...and will now joust
with the Earl of Dorchester.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.902
For you, my lady.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.615
You've a fine husband.

25:48.505 --> 25:51.007
Point for the Duke of Suffolk.

25:53.302 --> 25:56.930
Gentlemen, renew your lances.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.308
Is Her Majesty not attending
the tournament today?

26:00.476 --> 26:03.311
No. She's worried the excitements
of the tournament...

26:03.479 --> 26:05.021
...might harm her unborn son.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.982
Or so she supposes it to be.

26:08.651 --> 26:12.028
Personally, I hope she did not visit
the same astrologer as before.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.545
Lady Jane.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.174
Your Majesty.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.968
I'm about to go and joust.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.347
Would you do me the honour
of allowing me to wear your favours?

26:57.157 --> 27:00.326
Another point
for the Duke of Suffolk.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.872
Match goes to the Duke of Suffolk.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.111
His Majesty the king
has entered the list...

27:35.738 --> 27:41.617
...and will now joust à la plaisance
with Sir Henry Norris.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.710
Well done, Charles.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.888
-Well done, my love.
-Thank you.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.648
Move! Move!

28:54.650 --> 28:56.192
Is he dead? Is he dead?

28:57.778 --> 29:00.988
-ls he--?
-Let others help him. You can't.

29:08.997 --> 29:12.500
Take him with all care
into the pavilion...

29:12.668 --> 29:14.669
...where I may serve him better.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.381
And pray for him.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.178
-Seymour, Boleyn.
-Your Grace.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.696
Your Majesty.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.871
God save you, Your Majesty.

29:54.376 --> 29:57.670
Madam. Madam. Oh, madam.

29:57.838 --> 30:01.007
Madge? What is it?
What's happened?

30:01.383 --> 30:03.134
-Madge, what's happened?
-Oh, madam...

30:03.552 --> 30:07.054
...the king has fallen from his horse
and has been crushed.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.140
They....

30:09.683 --> 30:12.560
They say he is likely to die.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.439
Mark.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.233
-Your Majesty.
-No, no, no.

30:19.776 --> 30:22.028
Oh, say it's not so.

30:22.196 --> 30:26.240
Oh, no, no. Oh, no, please, no.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.909
Mark.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.454
Oh, God. Please say it's not so.
No, no.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.126
His heart is very weak.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.254
I don't know
if he will come back to us.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.091
Will you bleed him?

30:44.259 --> 30:48.262
I don't think so, Your Grace.
I do not see it will help him.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.767
His Majesty is now
in the hands of God.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.115
-Where are we going?
-Back to Whitehall.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.784
Don't you understand anything?

31:09.952 --> 31:11.786
In such a crisis,
all could disintegrate.

31:11.954 --> 31:14.747
So the centre has to hold,
and we must hold it.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.000
Mr. Secretary,
a letter from Dover, sir.

31:20.921 --> 31:24.090
Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.634
-News?
-There is no news.

31:26.802 --> 31:29.470
The king still shows no signs of life.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.767
-How long since the accident?
-Almost an hour ago, Your Honour.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.195
Mr. Secretary, what is to be done?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.990
Preparations in the event of death
for the coronation...

32:31.158 --> 32:34.201
...of Princess Elizabeth,
with your lordship's approval.

32:34.870 --> 32:38.039
She would be in a minority, but under
the wardship of her mother...

32:38.206 --> 32:40.041
...and with yourself
as Lord Protector.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.710
Have you posted a guard
on Lady Mary? Closed the ports?

32:42.878 --> 32:44.545
All that is in hand.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.757
As are preparations
for an emergency recall of Parliament.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.217
Kings had no need for Parliament
in the old days.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.054
These are not the old days, my lord.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.278
You know, I cannot think...

33:51.613 --> 33:54.240
...whether it would be a bad thing...

33:54.408 --> 33:56.951
...or a good thing if he died.

33:58.286 --> 34:04.291
For, as Lord Protector,
you would ipso facto...

34:05.127 --> 34:07.378
...be King of England.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.673
Your Majesty?

35:34.841 --> 35:36.091
Your Majesty.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.844
Majesty.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.898
Charles.

35:53.527 --> 35:56.403
Oh, thank God. He's alive.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.699
Thank God.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.582
Right, gentlemen, out. Out.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.543
Give us some air.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.300
The king lives.

36:22.889 --> 36:27.434
We must be grateful that His Majesty
took no hurt in his fall.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.436
Yes, thank God.

36:29.604 --> 36:33.148
But it means that the safe production
of a son from your womb...

36:33.316 --> 36:35.776
...is more than ever imperative.

36:36.278 --> 36:41.115
So l beg you to be always careful
with yourself.

36:41.575 --> 36:44.910
Take no exertions or excitements.

36:45.078 --> 36:48.956
Shut yourself away,
as much as you can, from the world.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.792
I wish there was a way l could remove
Mistress Seymour...

36:51.960 --> 36:54.295
...from among my ladies,
but I dare not.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.171
I think it would anger the king.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.299
This is what l mean.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.634
If you fret about such little matters...

37:00.802 --> 37:03.804
...then your thoughts may poison
the child inside you.

37:04.639 --> 37:08.142
It is not a little matter to me.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.853
It is for now.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.482
Afterwards, when you have given
the king his great desire...

37:15.650 --> 37:19.653
...then you will have all the power
to deal with her as you like.

37:23.783 --> 37:28.370
Think that l am the angel
come down to tell you...

37:29.456 --> 37:33.500
...that you carry the Christ child
in your belly.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.737
What is it?

38:01.905 --> 38:05.699
Because of the fall, this old wound
on your leg has reopened...

38:05.867 --> 38:07.368
...and an ulcer has formed.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.996
-Can you heal it?
-Most certainly, Your Majesty.

38:11.164 --> 38:14.750
For now, you'll have to wear
a dressing, have the leg bound up.

38:17.545 --> 38:20.089
Though Your Majesty
is still a young man...

38:20.256 --> 38:23.384
...you're not as young
as you used to be.

38:23.551 --> 38:30.557
In those days, you were able to joust
the whole day and not feel the effect.

38:39.150 --> 38:43.153
I have a message from the king for
your daughter, and for her ears alone.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.243
Jane.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.753
-Your Grace.
-Lady Jane.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.756
His Majesty is pleased
to send you this letter.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.552
And this purse. He commends you
accept these gifts...

39:06.720 --> 39:09.304
...in the spirit
in which they are offered.

39:39.961 --> 39:44.131
I'm so happy you're well.
I was so alarmed, so afraid.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.509
So was I when I thought
that through my foolishness...

39:47.719 --> 39:50.471
-...you might lose the child.
-Your foolishness?

39:51.973 --> 39:55.309
It was a mistake to think
I could behave like I used to.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.227
In any case...

39:59.147 --> 40:00.731
...those carefree days are gone.

40:07.322 --> 40:12.326
Our daughter was brought to court
and everyone admired her.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.828
I think she'll be a great beauty.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.997
Of course she will.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.874
Look at her mother.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.841
Will you not ask King Francis
to reconsider his refusal?

40:28.885 --> 40:32.012
If we delay much longer in finding
a good marriage for Elizabeth...

40:32.180 --> 40:35.015
...people will talk even more
than they do already.

40:35.183 --> 40:39.394
Why do you talk of Elizabeth
when Mary is not yet betrothed?

40:41.356 --> 40:44.817
Surely you have more of a care
for your legitimate daughter.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.693
Charles.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.752
What did she say?

41:03.920 --> 41:07.214
She returned the letter unopened
and the purse both.

41:07.382 --> 41:11.218
She said that she has no greater
treasure in the world than her honour.

41:11.386 --> 41:15.764
And that if you want to give her
money, she prays you might do so...

41:15.932 --> 41:19.101
...when she has made
an honourable marriage.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.862
She has behaved herself
in this matter most modestly.

41:43.251 --> 41:46.920
His Excellency,
the imperial ambassador.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.719
Excellency.

41:53.887 --> 41:57.598
I wondered if you had put the
emperor's proposals to the king.

41:58.641 --> 41:59.892
Not exactly.

42:05.273 --> 42:09.860
I wish with all my heart that we could
reach a speedy accommodation.

42:11.154 --> 42:14.740
However, in the question
of legitimizing the Lady Mary...

42:14.908 --> 42:17.117
...there remains one great obstacle.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.785
You mean the queen.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.375
I know she hates the emperor
as Catherine's nephew.

42:26.628 --> 42:31.131
They say that when she was told
of his victory over the Turks...

42:31.299 --> 42:35.302
...she looked like a dog
being thrown out of a window.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.141
But what can we do?

42:48.191 --> 42:52.903
If there is an obstacle in our path,
Excellency...

42:54.322 --> 42:56.823
...we must find a way around it.

43:24.686 --> 43:26.478
Lady Jane.

43:26.646 --> 43:28.188
Majesty.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.194
I pray you come closer.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.867
Closer still.

43:41.369 --> 43:42.703
Here.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.538
Sit on my knee.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.750
Don't be afraid.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.723
I respect your honour...

44:03.516 --> 44:05.267
...believe me.

44:07.395 --> 44:11.773
In the future, I won't see you unless
your other family members are present.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.235
I just had to see you now.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.405
Yes, Your Majesty.

44:21.701 --> 44:24.244
Your favour saved my life.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.413
-No, it--
-Yes.

44:27.415 --> 44:30.250
As l lay there,
your image came to me...

44:30.710 --> 44:33.211
...and l awoke with its promise.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.424
What should l say?

44:39.427 --> 44:41.261
Will you let me kiss you, Jane?

44:58.321 --> 44:59.780
Once more.

45:08.122 --> 45:09.790
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

45:10.416 --> 45:12.501
Oh, my God, what is this?

45:12.668 --> 45:14.336
What is this?

45:19.300 --> 45:21.593
Just when my belly
is doing its business...

45:21.761 --> 45:24.137
...l find you wenching
with Mistress Seymour.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.305
-Sweetheart.
-No.

45:25.473 --> 45:27.432
Jane, you had best leave.

45:29.102 --> 45:31.144
Why are you doing this?

45:31.312 --> 45:33.480
Why did you have to do this?

45:35.858 --> 45:38.944
-Peace. Peace, now.
-No, no, no.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.824
Stop. Stop it.

45:44.158 --> 45:45.867
Stop.

45:46.369 --> 45:48.328
Peace.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.844
Two knaves.

46:04.637 --> 46:07.848
Two queens and a king.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.683
You win.

46:13.855 --> 46:18.108
-Do you think l should go and see if--?
-No. Let her sleep.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.407
No!

46:28.536 --> 46:30.745
What is it, Your Majesty?

46:37.170 --> 46:39.629
-The baby.
-My God.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.339
My boy.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.717
Get some help.

46:43.885 --> 46:46.845
-Hurry.
-No, no, no.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.680
No!

46:57.565 --> 46:59.065
No.

47:35.311 --> 47:37.062
You've lost my boy.

47:39.774 --> 47:41.775
I cannot speak of it.

47:42.443 --> 47:43.902
The loss is too great.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.239
But l see now...

47:47.740 --> 47:51.910
...that God will not grant me
any male children.

47:54.455 --> 47:56.206
When you are up...

47:56.624 --> 47:58.625
...l will speak with you.

48:00.086 --> 48:02.796
It is not all my fault.

48:06.509 --> 48:09.469
You have no one to blame
but yourself for this.

48:09.637 --> 48:13.974
I was distressed to see you
with that wench Jane Seymour.

48:14.141 --> 48:18.728
Because the love l bear you
is so great...

48:20.481 --> 48:24.943
...it broke my heart
to see you loved others.

48:39.458 --> 48:42.002
I said l will speak with you...

48:42.670 --> 48:44.796
...when you are well.

48:49.844 --> 48:53.013
No!

48:53.681 --> 48:55.473
Your Majesty.

48:56.517 --> 48:58.393
Majesty.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.207
It's true...

49:21.375 --> 49:23.543
...what they have whispered.

49:25.588 --> 49:27.714
I shut my ears to them...

49:28.049 --> 49:30.383
...but now l know it to be true.

49:33.054 --> 49:35.347
I made this marriage...

49:35.514 --> 49:37.891
...seduced by witchcraft.

49:38.809 --> 49:44.064
And for that reason
consider it to be null and void.

49:45.399 --> 49:50.612
And the evidence is that God
will not permit us male issue.

49:55.743 --> 49:57.869
So now l believe...

49:58.704 --> 50:01.623
...with all my heart...

50:03.834 --> 50:06.419
...that l will take another wife.
