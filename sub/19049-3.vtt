WEBVTT

00:01.758 --> 00:04.625
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with us.

00:04.745 --> 00:06.928
- Yes, this shouldn't take long.
- So...

00:07.048 --> 00:08.318
You'd like to buy a boat.

00:08.438 --> 00:12.362
Yes, we have recently come into
a considerable amount of money.

00:12.482 --> 00:14.771
Now I'm not gonna bore you with details,
but let's just say

00:14.891 --> 00:17.486
that my friends here
set up for a *** adventure...

00:17.606 --> 00:18.699
- ***.com.
- Yeah.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.006
- Actually we're not supposed to talk about...
- That's true but...

00:21.126 --> 00:24.224
Yeah, technically we're doing a couple
of things in the hush hush from Uncle Sam...

00:24.344 --> 00:28.345
The point is we're flush.
We are 25 hundred dollars flush.

00:28.465 --> 00:29.471
So don't worry about that.

00:29.591 --> 00:32.323
So we'd like to take some of that money
and taste a bit of the high life.

00:32.576 --> 00:34.377
We've also talked to our friend here

00:34.410 --> 00:35.983
into throwing
 his entire life savings into the venture.

00:36.103 --> 00:36.769
That's right.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.806
You see, I'm in it for the lifestyle
as well as the great investment.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.575
Okay, well, then what is it
you guys are looking for?

00:42.643 --> 00:43.810
Let's talk needs, please?

00:43.878 --> 00:45.378
I'd like to talk needs first.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.980
Now I have the need for speed.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.749
It's very important, it's inherent,
there's nothing I can do about it.

00:49.817 --> 00:50.783
So speed is a must.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.286
Absolutely, but we are also
looking to entertain guests upon

00:53.354 --> 00:55.522
this boat, so...
Yeah, we're gonna throw some

00:55.589 --> 00:57.524
P. Diddy-style parties
up on the deck.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.959
Um, can we talk
shrimp for a minute?

01:00.027 --> 01:04.030
I'd like the boat to be able to haul
in a tremendous amount of shrimp.

01:04.098 --> 01:07.000
Sort of a Forrest Gump-size
amount of shrimp.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.502
Um, you should be writing
this down, I think.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.371
Why are you not
writing this down?

01:11.438 --> 01:14.293
Oh, let me just see
if I have this right here.

01:14.413 --> 01:15.953
Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

01:16.249 --> 01:18.858
It seems what you guys are
looking for is some sort of

01:18.978 --> 01:20.480
P. Diddy-style shrimping vessel.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.147
All right!

01:21.215 --> 01:21.814
That's it!

01:21.882 --> 01:24.050
You're a really good listener,
and I didn't peg you

01:24.118 --> 01:27.186
for one when I walked in here 'cause
of the pinky ring, but that's great.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.557
You know, I've got just the boat for you.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.892
Well, here she is, The
Drowning Sailor.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.030
It, uh, doesn't meet, well,
uh, any of your specs.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.198
Look, I'm gonna level
with you, pal.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.234
We... we saw this coming a mile

01:41.302 --> 01:43.836
away, and we've had our hearts
set on this boat thing for

01:43.904 --> 01:47.907
days now, which, in our world,
is a level of focus in which

01:47.975 --> 01:50.133
I personally have
never experienced.

01:50.765 --> 01:53.413
But I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and I'm gonna say... We'll take it!

01:53.480 --> 01:54.080
Mm-hmm.

01:54.148 --> 01:54.814
What-what-what are you doing?

01:54.882 --> 01:55.481
I was-I was doing a thing.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.916
You were taking a
long time, dude.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.351
You're taking way too long.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.018
We wanted to buy a boat.

01:59.086 --> 01:59.686
Let's get the boat.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.087
I was taking a little while
because I was doing a little

02:01.155 --> 02:02.488
presentation...
Dennis, what if someone walks

02:02.556 --> 02:03.823
down the deck and makes
an offer before us?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.925
Nobody's gonna make an offer
before I finish my thing.

02:05.993 --> 02:06.593
They might have.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.794
We're not the only people in town that want...
I'm confused.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.395
Are you gonna take
the boat or not?

02:10.464 --> 02:11.531
Yes, we're taking the boat.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.332
We're buying the boat.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.267
We want to add a little
fanfare into the situation.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.002
My friends here, they
couldn't wait for that.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.805
Yes, we're-we're
taking the boat.

02:53.011 --> 02:54.011
What a score!

02:54.079 --> 02:54.678
Yeah!

02:54.746 --> 02:55.347
Houseboat, huh?

02:55.614 --> 02:57.282
Yeah, absolutely...
Well, the houseboat offers all

02:57.350 --> 02:59.784
the advantages of a house, but
with the excitement of the sea.

02:59.852 --> 03:01.786
Think of all the fish
we're gonna catch.

03:01.854 --> 03:03.154
It's not just fish, Frank.

03:03.222 --> 03:04.522
You gotta start thinking
about shrimp, okay?

03:04.590 --> 03:05.256
Oh-oh-oh.

03:05.257 --> 03:07.625
We're gonna be hauling in so
much shrimp every day, it's

03:07.693 --> 03:09.027
gonna pay for itself ten times over.

03:09.095 --> 03:11.183
Picture tiny shrimp crawling
all over this boat.

03:11.215 --> 03:12.210
- Every inch of it...
- Guys...

03:12.760 --> 03:15.123
Can we not focus on the shrimp
cause we have so much work to do.

03:15.243 --> 03:15.972
It's a shrimp boat.

03:16.039 --> 03:17.473
I'd like to have at least one
conversation about shrimp.

03:17.541 --> 03:19.509
No. No, shrimp is a very
small aspect of the whole...

03:19.576 --> 03:21.644
Most important part of the...
No, you know what?

03:21.712 --> 03:22.311
I'll tell you what.

03:22.379 --> 03:23.746
Shrimp or no shrimp, I'm
very excited about it.

03:23.814 --> 03:24.413
Yeah.

03:24.481 --> 03:26.749
And I say we take this little
lady onto the sea and get loaded.

03:26.817 --> 03:28.117
Well, slow your roll there, Dee.

03:28.185 --> 03:30.353
The lady's not quite ready
to go out to the sea yet.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.655
There's a lot of prep work
that still has to be done.

03:32.723 --> 03:35.191
So, actually, Frank and Charlie,
I want you to start by scraping

03:35.259 --> 03:37.460
the barnacles off the bottom of
the boat, 'cause that probably

03:37.528 --> 03:40.396
hasn't been done in years,
while Dee and Mac and I go in

03:40.464 --> 03:43.278
to the inside and check out the
decor situation, you know?

03:44.968 --> 03:45.568
One word.

03:45.636 --> 03:46.235
Shrimp.

03:47.538 --> 03:48.471
Okay, yeah.

03:48.539 --> 03:51.741
No, just as I suspected, we got
our work cut out for us, guys.

03:51.809 --> 03:53.609
This isn't Diddyesque at all.

03:53.677 --> 03:56.245
No, no, we gotta get
rid of all this shit.

03:56.313 --> 03:57.914
Are you guys crazy?

03:57.981 --> 03:58.981
This boat is awesome.

03:59.049 --> 04:00.850
How about a little of this?

04:04.688 --> 04:07.924
Huh?

04:07.991 --> 04:10.660
What the hell is that?

04:10.727 --> 04:12.328
This?

04:12.396 --> 04:13.529
That's my P. Diddy boat dance.

04:13.597 --> 04:14.197
Uh!

04:14.264 --> 04:17.600
You look like one of this inflatable
dancing things at the used car lot.

04:17.668 --> 04:19.202
The ones that flail
around in the wind.

04:19.269 --> 04:20.101
No, I don't.

04:20.170 --> 04:20.803
I look good.

04:20.870 --> 04:22.572
No, Dee, that's exactly
what you look like.

04:22.639 --> 04:24.240
I promise you that's
what you look like.

04:24.308 --> 04:25.141
You can't dance for shit!

04:25.209 --> 04:27.376
I can dance, and you don't know
what you're talking about.

04:27.444 --> 04:28.845
I'm gonna bring one of those
in so you can see it.

04:28.912 --> 04:31.514
Okay, why don't you bring the guy
in, we'll have a dance competition?

04:31.582 --> 04:33.216
I'm gonna be the judge
of that contest!

04:33.283 --> 04:33.883
I'm gonna show...!

04:33.951 --> 04:35.351
There's not gonna be a contest!

04:35.419 --> 04:36.619
Stop! Everybody stop! Shut up!

04:36.687 --> 04:38.788
No, nobody's bringing any trashy
inflatable man on this boat.

04:38.856 --> 04:39.455
Absolutely not.

04:39.523 --> 04:40.122
Dee, stop dancing.

04:40.858 --> 04:41.791
You look like an asshole.

04:41.859 --> 04:42.859
We're not there yet.

04:42.926 --> 04:44.961
We have a lot of work to do first.

04:45.028 --> 04:47.096
Okay, Dee, since you didn't
invest any money in this

04:47.164 --> 04:50.132
venture, you're gonna be the one that's
got to do all the hard labor here.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.102
So I need you to get rid of all
this shit, and make the boat

04:53.170 --> 04:53.769
look nice, okay?

04:53.837 --> 04:54.437
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

04:54.504 --> 04:55.104
Hard work?

04:55.172 --> 04:56.372
What are you talking about?

04:56.440 --> 04:58.441
Work first, and then you can
do your weird inflatable

04:58.508 --> 04:59.909
tube-man P. Diddy dance.

04:59.977 --> 05:01.210
Or whatever it is.

05:01.278 --> 05:04.213
You know what I'm looking forward to?

05:04.281 --> 05:05.948
Is catching me some
Delaware River catfish.

05:06.016 --> 05:06.616
Oh, yeah!

05:06.683 --> 05:07.750
They are so tasty!

05:07.818 --> 05:09.752
I used to eat 'em when I was a kid.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.821
You can't buy 'em in
the stores no more.

05:11.889 --> 05:12.788
Why is that?

05:12.856 --> 05:13.689
The goddamned EPA.

05:13.757 --> 05:14.590
They says they're toxic.

05:14.658 --> 05:15.992
Toxic my ass.

05:16.059 --> 05:17.326
I mean, they're just endangered.

05:17.394 --> 05:18.527
They're tasty, man.

05:18.595 --> 05:21.797
Frank. this boat is the best
investment I ever made, man.

05:21.865 --> 05:22.665
I mean, it's huge!

05:22.733 --> 05:26.769
We're gonna pop over to the boat store
real quick and grab some, uh...

05:26.837 --> 05:28.921
Whoa!
What the hell are you guys doing?

05:29.041 --> 05:32.156
- We're loading our gear.
- No, no, no. You should not be loading.

05:32.276 --> 05:33.676
No one should be bringing
anything onto the boat.

05:33.744 --> 05:35.077
You should be scraping, okay?

05:35.145 --> 05:35.745
Yes.

05:35.812 --> 05:36.379
So, scrape.

05:36.446 --> 05:38.614
Oh, well, we're gonna scrape the boat.

05:38.682 --> 05:40.216
We are gonna scrape the boat.

05:40.284 --> 05:41.517
Are you patronizing me?

05:41.585 --> 05:42.485
Don't patronize me.

05:42.552 --> 05:43.386
Don't do that.

05:43.453 --> 05:44.954
No one's patronizing you, all right?

05:45.022 --> 05:45.755
Here's what we'll do:

05:45.822 --> 05:47.723
we'll scrape all these little
delicious oysters or whatever

05:47.791 --> 05:48.624
off the side of the boat.

05:48.692 --> 05:50.893
We'll put 'em in a pot, we'll boil
'em up for before you get back.

05:50.961 --> 05:52.328
We'll cook 'em for you.

05:52.396 --> 05:52.995
There you go.

05:53.063 --> 05:54.330
No, those are barnacles.

05:54.398 --> 05:55.164
Do not eat those.

05:55.232 --> 05:57.333
Do not cook them in a pot
and serve them to us.

05:57.401 --> 05:58.200
Okay, all that.

05:58.268 --> 05:59.468
Honestly, don't eat those.

05:59.536 --> 06:00.870
You'll get very, very sick, okay?

06:00.938 --> 06:01.537
Yeah.

06:01.605 --> 06:02.939
Now that is a direct
order from your captain.

06:03.006 --> 06:04.340
Whoa!
Since when are you the captain?

06:04.408 --> 06:05.708
Well, clearly I'm the captain.

06:05.776 --> 06:06.842
Who else would be the captain.

06:06.910 --> 06:08.411
I feel like I would be the captain.

06:08.478 --> 06:09.078
Dennis?

06:09.146 --> 06:09.879
I don't give a shit.

06:09.947 --> 06:10.813
I'm captain! I call it!

06:10.881 --> 06:11.480
Locked in. Boom.

06:11.548 --> 06:12.148
Scrape. Let's go.

06:12.883 --> 06:13.950
Let's go. Let's go.

06:14.017 --> 06:15.284
I ain't scraping shit.

06:15.352 --> 06:16.652
No, we're not scraping!

06:16.720 --> 06:17.320
No, no scraping.

06:17.387 --> 06:18.621
Here's what we're gonna do.

06:18.689 --> 06:20.056
We're gonna fire up the boat, right?

06:20.123 --> 06:20.723
Yeah.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.825
We're gonna take it out on
the ocean, we're gonna get

06:22.893 --> 06:23.492
some oysters. And shrimp.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.160
And shrimpies!

06:24.995 --> 06:26.329
Toss me the keys.

06:26.396 --> 06:29.265
Here you go.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.133
What the hell was that?

06:31.201 --> 06:32.234
Well, it's the keys.

06:32.302 --> 06:33.369
I threw 'em right at ya.

06:33.437 --> 06:34.704
I asked you to toss 'em!

06:34.771 --> 06:35.371
You threw 'em overhand!

06:35.439 --> 06:36.739
That's the way I throw!

06:36.807 --> 06:38.074
Jump in there and get 'em.

06:38.141 --> 06:39.442
I'm not going in there.

06:39.509 --> 06:40.109
I don't sink.

06:40.177 --> 06:40.776
What?

06:40.844 --> 06:43.245
I get in there, I just bob
around like a cauliflower.

06:43.313 --> 06:44.613
Don't give me lines, man.

06:44.681 --> 06:46.615
Jump in the ocean and
get the damn keys!

06:46.683 --> 06:47.616
No, I'm not going in.

06:48.352 --> 06:49.652
Charlie, I'm not going in.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.454
It's your boat. You go on in.

06:51.521 --> 06:52.855
You son of a bitch.

06:52.923 --> 06:54.857
All right.

07:03.329 --> 07:03.962
Yo.

07:04.029 --> 07:04.862
Hey, buddy.

07:04.930 --> 07:08.299
Uh, I got us some turpentine, some
wax and some high-gloss boat paint.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.634
This shit is really expensive.

07:09.702 --> 07:10.768
Oh, dude, you're telling me.

07:10.836 --> 07:13.104
I picked us up some new slacks
and docksiders so we could have

07:13.172 --> 07:15.139
the right look, you know,
and fit in and everything.

07:15.207 --> 07:17.675
We're running pretty low on
remaining dick towel money though.

07:17.743 --> 07:20.144
Plus, we got to fill that thing
up with gas, and... I know, man.

07:20.212 --> 07:22.080
We got to pop by the department
store, pick up the mattress.

07:22.147 --> 07:23.081
I want to get a nice one, too.

07:23.148 --> 07:23.848
You know what I'm saying?

07:23.916 --> 07:24.983
The what? The mattress?

07:25.050 --> 07:25.883
What do we need a mattress for?

07:25.951 --> 07:28.019
What do you mean what do
we need a mattress for?

07:28.087 --> 07:31.089
Why in the hell do you think we just
spent all that money on a boat?

07:31.156 --> 07:32.890
The whole purpose of buying the
boat in the first place was to

07:32.958 --> 07:35.727
get the ladies nice and tipsy
topside, so we can take them to

07:35.794 --> 07:39.397
a nice comfortable place below deck
and, you know, they can't refuse.

07:39.465 --> 07:42.233
Because of the implication.

07:42.301 --> 07:44.314
Oh. Uh, okay.

07:44.905 --> 07:46.382
You had me going for the first part,

07:46.425 --> 07:48.127
but the second half kind of threw me.

07:48.247 --> 07:49.140
Well, dude, dude, think about it.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.943
She's out in the middle of nowhere
with some dude she barely knows.

07:52.011 --> 07:53.511
She looks around and
what does she see?

07:53.579 --> 07:54.579
Nothing but open ocean.

07:54.647 --> 07:56.414
"Ah, there's nowhere for me to run.

07:56.482 --> 07:58.534
What am I going to do, say no?"

07:59.359 --> 08:00.067
Okay.

08:01.820 --> 08:02.754
That seems really dark.

08:02.821 --> 08:03.655
No, it's not dark.

08:03.722 --> 08:04.722
You're misunderstanding me, bro.

08:04.790 --> 08:05.423
I think I am.

08:05.491 --> 08:06.157
Yeah, you are.

08:06.225 --> 08:08.326
Because if the girl said no,
then the answer obviously is no.

08:08.394 --> 08:08.993
No.

08:09.061 --> 08:10.528
But the thing is, she's
not going to say no.

08:10.596 --> 08:13.665
She would never say no,
because of the implication.

08:15.467 --> 08:18.936
Now... you said that word
"implication" a couple of times.

08:19.004 --> 08:20.471
What... what implication?

08:20.539 --> 08:23.241
The implication that things
might go wrong for her if she

08:23.308 --> 08:24.742
refuses to sleep with me.

08:24.810 --> 08:27.278
You know, not that things are
going to go wrong for her, but

08:27.346 --> 08:28.546
she's thinking that they will.

08:28.614 --> 08:31.282
But it sounds like she doesn't
want to have sex with you.

08:31.350 --> 08:32.750
Why aren't you understanding this?

08:32.818 --> 08:35.119
I don't... She doesn't know whether
she wants to have sex with me.

08:35.187 --> 08:35.787
She doesn't know?

08:35.854 --> 08:36.453
That's not the issue.

08:36.522 --> 08:37.188
Are you going to hurt women?

08:37.256 --> 08:38.556
I'm not going to hurt these women.

08:38.624 --> 08:39.222
Oh, okay.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.558
Why would I ever hurt these women?

08:40.626 --> 08:41.225
I don't know.

08:41.293 --> 08:42.727
I feel like you're not
getting this at all.

08:42.794 --> 08:43.695
I'm not getting it.

08:43.761 --> 08:45.096
Goddamn.

08:45.164 --> 08:46.064
Don't you look at me like that.

08:46.131 --> 08:47.932
You certainly wouldn't
be in any danger.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.666
So they are in danger?

08:48.734 --> 08:49.667
No one's in any danger.

08:49.735 --> 08:51.636
How can I make that any
more clear to you?

08:51.704 --> 08:53.771
Okay, it's an implication of danger.

08:53.839 --> 08:54.839
You know what, just drop it.

08:54.907 --> 08:55.940
Let's drop it.

08:56.008 --> 08:58.843
Buy your shit and let's
get out of here.

09:02.863 --> 09:04.197
Oh, Charlie.

09:04.264 --> 09:05.231
Charlie, you got 'em?

09:05.299 --> 09:06.365
No keys. Can't find 'em.

09:06.433 --> 09:07.300
What?!

09:07.367 --> 09:09.468
I found a couple cool things.

09:09.536 --> 09:10.336
What?

09:10.404 --> 09:11.737
I got a tooth.

09:11.805 --> 09:13.206
Ooh, look at that.

09:13.273 --> 09:15.585
- It's like a horse's tooth or something.
- Oh, yeah.

09:15.705 --> 09:17.320
- And look at this ***.
- Uh.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.867
This is a war relic.

09:19.162 --> 09:20.513
This could be valuable.

09:20.766 --> 09:22.915
What the hell happened down there?

09:22.983 --> 09:23.983
Some kind of horse massacre?

09:24.051 --> 09:25.251
Could be.

09:25.319 --> 09:26.285
Could be, right?

09:26.353 --> 09:26.953
Yeah.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.621
Dude, there's so much cool shit
down there, I'm gonna keep

09:28.689 --> 09:29.622
diving looking for it.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.624
I need a flashlight 'cause it's dark.

09:31.692 --> 09:32.692
Flashlight coming up.

09:32.759 --> 09:34.927
Just toss it to me real quick.

09:34.995 --> 09:36.295
Come on, man.

09:36.363 --> 09:37.930
I throw overhand, Charlie.

09:38.899 --> 09:39.765
Ooh!

09:39.833 --> 09:45.338
♪ Stop Drop Shut 'em
down, open up shop... ♪

09:45.405 --> 09:47.506
What the hell are you doing in here?

09:47.574 --> 09:50.276
Just throwing all these old,
like, dolls and compasses and

09:50.344 --> 09:52.445
hairbrushes and shit overboard.

09:52.512 --> 09:54.413
Mac and Dennis are making me clean up.

09:54.481 --> 09:57.550
Well, this is a shit hole, isn't it?

09:57.618 --> 09:58.751
Yeah.

09:58.819 --> 09:59.885
Maybe we should gut it.

09:59.953 --> 10:00.820
All right.

10:00.887 --> 10:04.290
Let's see...
Ooh, ah, here we go.

10:04.358 --> 10:05.124
Now, let's see.

10:05.192 --> 10:08.594
Start with this beautiful baby here.

10:08.662 --> 10:10.062
Whoa.

10:10.130 --> 10:11.697
Crash and burn.

10:11.765 --> 10:15.201
Holy mackerel.

10:15.302 --> 10:17.703
Die, you sucker!

10:17.771 --> 10:20.373
Oh, baby, look out.

10:22.409 --> 10:25.044
Whoa! That ain't good.

10:27.114 --> 10:28.781
♪ Give a dog a bone
Leave a dog alone... ♪

10:28.849 --> 10:31.150
Whoa, Christ.

10:31.218 --> 10:33.886
Think about, like, all the
movies and the books and all

10:33.954 --> 10:36.789
the stories of all the
terrible awful, awful things

10:36.857 --> 10:38.858
that have happened out in
the middle of the ocean.

10:38.925 --> 10:40.793
You know, that's the stuff
that's, like, rattling around in

10:40.861 --> 10:43.896
her head, informing her decision as
to whether she sleeps with me or not.

10:43.964 --> 10:44.764
That's all I'm saying.

10:44.831 --> 10:46.966
It's not like a big thing, or...
Uh-huh.

10:47.034 --> 10:49.268
Look, I need you to
understand this, okay?

10:49.336 --> 10:51.904
You're making it seem like I'm
some sort of monster or something.

10:51.972 --> 10:52.772
Yeah, okay.

10:52.839 --> 10:54.707
Hey, wha...
what is going on in there?

10:54.775 --> 10:55.408
Like this?

10:55.475 --> 10:56.876
It's more like a rolling sway.

10:56.943 --> 10:57.610
Like this. There you go.

10:57.678 --> 10:59.245
What the hell are you
guys doing in here?

10:59.313 --> 11:01.781
Oh, my God, what the hell
did you do to our boat?!

11:01.848 --> 11:02.748
Uh, we were cleaning it.

11:03.483 --> 11:05.351
Wow, wow, wow, what's that all about?

11:05.419 --> 11:07.420
You're just breaking
everything in this boat.

11:07.487 --> 11:09.855
You were supposed to be fixing
it up and making it look nice.

11:09.923 --> 11:12.091
Crew meeting! Crew meeting!

11:12.159 --> 11:13.092
Where is Charlie?

11:13.160 --> 11:13.893
He's in the water.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.595
What is he doing in the water?

11:16.663 --> 11:18.464
Charlie.

11:18.532 --> 11:20.399
Aw, dude, what are you doing?

11:20.467 --> 11:21.801
Oh, hey, guys, come here.

11:21.868 --> 11:24.470
You are not going to believe how
much cool shit is under the boat.

11:24.538 --> 11:26.405
There's like a whole
world of ancient stuff.

11:26.473 --> 11:28.140
There was a horse massacre,
right, in the Revolutionary

11:28.208 --> 11:29.975
times, and then there's
like a pirate ship.

11:30.043 --> 11:32.311
Like, I found all these
old pretty little dolls.

11:32.431 --> 11:35.427
- No. - Maybe like a brush, like
a pirate is brushing his hair...

11:35.473 --> 11:37.093
Killed the horse and
then jumped in the ocean?

11:37.213 --> 11:39.285
Goddamn it, I've been cleaning
up in there for hours

11:39.353 --> 11:42.555
throwing this shit overboard and
you're just dragging it all back up.

11:42.622 --> 11:44.390
You've been dumping the
trash in the ocean?

11:44.458 --> 11:46.926
Why-why-why are you swimming in
the water in the first place?

11:46.993 --> 11:48.527
He dropped the keys in the water.

11:48.595 --> 11:51.630
I did not... All right, first of all,
he threw the keys at me overhand.

11:51.698 --> 11:52.798
You should have seen this throw.

11:52.866 --> 11:55.134
We leave you guys alone for 45
minutes and you destroy the

11:55.202 --> 11:58.471
interior of the boat, you lose the keys...
I can get those keys.

11:58.538 --> 12:00.706
I just need you guys to buy me
some scuba equipment so I can

12:00.774 --> 12:01.841
stay down there longer.

12:01.908 --> 12:03.876
Do you realize how much money
scuba equipment costs?

12:03.944 --> 12:04.910
No. Rent the cheap stuff.

12:04.978 --> 12:06.679
Just rent some cheap stuff, all right?

12:06.747 --> 12:09.315
In the meantime, we'll clear all
this stuff off... we'll start

12:09.383 --> 12:10.483
to paint, all right?

12:10.550 --> 12:14.520
By the time you guys come back,
I promise you, I promise, the

12:14.588 --> 12:16.922
boat will be looking better.

12:16.990 --> 12:18.290
I can't tell.

12:18.358 --> 12:19.225
Is he patronizing me again?

12:19.292 --> 12:20.793
I can't...
I can't even tell anymore.

12:20.861 --> 12:23.195
No, no, what he's saying is
really stupid, but it's sincere,

12:23.263 --> 12:24.597
okay? It's sincere this time.

12:24.664 --> 12:26.499
I think you're just a
little sensitive to it.

12:26.566 --> 12:27.233
Sorry, Charlie.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.701
I'm sorry, too.

12:28.769 --> 12:29.568
That was patronizing!

12:29.636 --> 12:31.203
You can't patronize your captain.

12:31.271 --> 12:33.205
That's a sea law.

12:38.478 --> 12:39.745
Yo, dude.

12:39.813 --> 12:42.081
You realize how much
boating equipment costs?

12:42.149 --> 12:43.816
It's crazy, it's astronomical.

12:43.884 --> 12:46.218
I can't believe how much
they charge for this shit.

12:46.286 --> 12:49.355
You know, Dee, Frank and
Charlie are driving me crazy.

12:49.423 --> 12:51.424
We're spending all of our dick
towel money and they're throwing

12:51.491 --> 12:54.627
keys into the water and losing everything...
And you're not even listening to me.

12:54.694 --> 12:55.294
No, I heard you.

12:55.362 --> 12:56.629
You said a bunch of words, right?

12:56.696 --> 12:57.363
Look at this.

12:57.431 --> 12:58.197
What is that?

12:58.265 --> 13:00.366
It's like some kind of
dock party mixer, dude.

13:00.434 --> 13:01.033
It's a flyer.

13:01.101 --> 13:01.901
Look at these chicks.

13:01.968 --> 13:02.568
And an anchor.

13:02.636 --> 13:04.336
Dude, that's what we need to be doing.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.138
We need to be mixing it up at
mixers with other boat people

13:06.206 --> 13:07.206
and living the lifestyle.

13:07.274 --> 13:07.873
You're right.

13:07.941 --> 13:08.541
Okay, cool.

13:08.608 --> 13:10.242
And then we'll be back
in the high life again.

13:10.310 --> 13:10.910
Yeah.

13:10.977 --> 13:11.610
Like Stevie Nicks.

13:11.678 --> 13:13.446
That's actually Steve Winwood.

13:13.513 --> 13:14.747
Right. Same dude, right?

13:14.815 --> 13:16.382
It's not the same dude.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.716
Actually, one's not even a dude.

13:17.784 --> 13:19.018
Are you sure?

13:19.085 --> 13:20.152
Yeah, I'm sure.

13:20.220 --> 13:20.853
It doesn't matter.

13:20.921 --> 13:21.520
I love that song.

13:21.588 --> 13:22.354
Let's buy that CD.

13:22.422 --> 13:24.223
Well, first of all, I
love that song, too.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.291
That's why I already own the CD.

13:25.358 --> 13:26.992
I own all of Steve Winwood's shit.

13:27.060 --> 13:27.827
You should know this.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.795
And secondly, we have not been
on the same page all day.

13:29.863 --> 13:32.331
We can't be spending money
on CDs that I already own.

13:32.399 --> 13:34.433
We're spending too
much money as it is.

13:34.501 --> 13:38.404
It's bad enough I let you buy that
stupid inflatable guy from the car lot.

13:40.841 --> 13:42.308
Stop it!

13:42.375 --> 13:44.009
Stop it!

13:44.077 --> 13:45.411
Goddamn it, don't!

13:45.479 --> 13:47.413
It's not the puffy
guy... it's this music.

13:47.481 --> 13:49.734
This aggressive music you're playing.

13:49.854 --> 13:53.153
- This is not...
- It's got nothing to do with the music.

13:53.273 --> 13:54.101
 Listen to me.

13:54.221 --> 13:55.221
Listen to me!

13:55.288 --> 13:56.121
I'm turning you off.

13:56.189 --> 13:56.822
You're crazy.

13:57.557 --> 13:58.791
Riled you up.

13:58.859 --> 14:01.594
Yo, you guys...
Look at you... fighting with a green guy.

14:01.661 --> 14:03.529
Dudes, you're never going to
believe what I just found

14:03.597 --> 14:05.130
floating off the end of the boat.

14:05.198 --> 14:07.399
Okay, I'm scraping those little delicious
oysters off the bottom, right?

14:07.467 --> 14:08.868
Why is this turned off?

14:08.935 --> 14:09.668
You're back.

14:09.736 --> 14:12.471
You don't even... Well, well, I got
to say, guys, I'm very impressed.

14:12.539 --> 14:13.939
The boat's really
starting to come along.

14:14.007 --> 14:15.674
I didn't think you guys had it in you.

14:15.742 --> 14:16.408
Yeah.

14:16.476 --> 14:18.911
There's a couple more brushes
here and a little paint.

14:18.979 --> 14:21.647
Get to work, we'll do the
trim and then we'll be done.

14:21.715 --> 14:22.314
Us?

14:22.382 --> 14:23.349
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:23.416 --> 14:25.050
We're not going to be
doing any of that.

14:25.118 --> 14:25.918
No, no, no.

14:25.986 --> 14:27.386
You're not going to
be doing any of that?

14:27.454 --> 14:28.053
What do you mean?

14:28.121 --> 14:29.488
We're not going to be
doing any of the work.

14:29.556 --> 14:31.023
That's-that's what you guys are doing.

14:31.091 --> 14:31.824
That was the whole deal.

14:31.892 --> 14:33.492
No, we got a party to get ready for.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.695
Yeah, so... We're going to do all the
work while you guys go to a party?

14:36.763 --> 14:37.596
We got to socialize.

14:37.664 --> 14:38.297
Yeah.

14:38.365 --> 14:39.031
I could socialize.

14:39.099 --> 14:40.566
Uh, no.
Not looking like you're looking.

14:40.634 --> 14:43.102
You're covered in paint and dirt and
grime and all kinds of shit, so...

14:43.169 --> 14:45.204
You're skin looks like leather and
you got blisters all over you.

14:45.272 --> 14:46.539
You guys look absolutely terrible.

14:46.606 --> 14:48.607
Well...
Well, we're out of here.

14:48.675 --> 14:52.177
So, Charlie, there's your,
uh, there's your scuba gear.

14:52.245 --> 14:53.412
Find the keys.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.147
Just find 'em.

14:55.215 --> 14:57.550
Oh, guys... keep up the good work.

14:57.617 --> 14:59.618
See, now they flipped it around.

14:59.686 --> 15:01.253
They're patronizing us.

15:01.321 --> 15:02.655
Absolutely patronizing us, Frank.

15:02.722 --> 15:04.957
That's right, they're patronizing...
But don't take it to heart,

15:05.025 --> 15:06.659
buddy, 'cause I got something
that's going to cheer you up.

15:06.726 --> 15:07.326
What?

15:07.394 --> 15:07.993
Guess who found the keys.

15:08.061 --> 15:08.661
The keys!

15:08.728 --> 15:09.328
You found the keys!

15:09.396 --> 15:10.729
Dude, they were just
floating under the boat.

15:10.797 --> 15:12.097
They got a little
floaty thing on them.

15:12.165 --> 15:13.532
This is amazing, by the
way... these floaty things.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.094
We should patent this.

15:19.993 --> 15:21.551
Okay, I think this is it.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.007
Now this is much more our speed.

15:23.127 --> 15:24.952
These are the kind of people
we should be hanging out with.

15:25.010 --> 15:26.443
Man, now this is a boat.

15:27.512 --> 15:28.579
Ahoy, ahoy.

15:28.647 --> 15:29.880
Hi, hi.

15:29.948 --> 15:31.015
A couple of fellow yachters.

15:31.082 --> 15:35.085
Saw your flyer at the boat store...
Oh.

15:35.153 --> 15:37.047
Do we have the wrong yacht?

15:37.167 --> 15:39.048
No, no, no, no, come on
in and grab a drink.

15:39.264 --> 15:40.535
We're just getting warmed up.

15:40.655 --> 15:41.922
Okay.

15:41.989 --> 15:42.656
Sure.

15:42.723 --> 15:45.279
Let's just...
Yeah.

15:47.326 --> 15:49.729
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

15:49.797 --> 15:50.664
Yeah.

15:50.731 --> 15:52.632
Um, this isn't the
crowd I was expecting.

15:52.700 --> 15:55.535
These guys are more barnacle covered
and sunburned than Dee and Frank.

15:55.603 --> 15:57.471
Let's not rush to judgment, okay?

15:57.538 --> 15:58.872
These are real men of the sea.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.074
Maybe this whole thing
isn't about meeting girls.

16:01.142 --> 16:04.344
Maybe it's about having an adventure,
you know, an open ocean adventure.

16:04.412 --> 16:05.545
Take a look at this guy.

16:05.613 --> 16:06.947
How'd he lose that hand?

16:07.014 --> 16:10.517
I bet you it was some kind
of crazy adventure, right?

16:10.637 --> 16:11.911
Let's find out.

16:15.048 --> 16:19.018
Hey, bro, how'd you lose that hand?

16:19.085 --> 16:21.554
Diabetes.

16:21.621 --> 16:23.188
Oh.

16:23.256 --> 16:29.109
Um, that's not, uh, much
of an adventure, is it?

16:29.229 --> 16:31.363
Kind of tragic.

16:31.431 --> 16:34.633
Yeah.

16:34.701 --> 16:38.137
You know, we'll let you get back to...
We're just going to go over to

16:38.204 --> 16:39.204
the bar and grab a drink.

16:39.272 --> 16:42.007
I'd offer to pour you a drink,
but you probably can't drink

16:42.075 --> 16:45.244
though with the...
diabetes.

16:45.312 --> 16:47.880
Diabetes.

16:47.948 --> 16:49.949
Yeah, yeah.

16:53.587 --> 16:55.821
Look, you know what,
I was wrong, dude.

16:55.889 --> 16:56.722
This is a bummer.

16:56.790 --> 16:58.023
Yeah, this is a major bummer.

16:58.091 --> 16:59.091
Let's get the hell out of here.

16:59.159 --> 16:59.758
What do you say?

16:59.826 --> 17:00.426
Yeah.

17:00.493 --> 17:02.294
Hey, listen, guys,
thanks for everything.

17:02.362 --> 17:04.029
I think we're just going
to take off, though.

17:04.097 --> 17:05.731
No, no, no, no, don't do that.

17:05.799 --> 17:07.165
We're just getting warmed up.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.468
We're going to set sail soon, and
we're going to have a couple

17:09.536 --> 17:10.935
of tasty treats out there.

17:11.003 --> 17:12.570
It's going to get nuts out
there, fellas, right?

17:13.940 --> 17:16.742
We're going to be out
on open ocean, right?

17:16.810 --> 17:18.743
Huh?

17:18.811 --> 17:20.913
Anything can happen out there.

17:20.981 --> 17:24.148
No laws, right, boys?

17:24.217 --> 17:28.079
Just us and our tasty treats.

17:30.585 --> 17:33.266
- That was an implication, right?
- That was definitely the implication.

17:33.579 --> 17:34.126
Tasty treats?

17:34.194 --> 17:34.827
Are we the tasty treats?

17:34.894 --> 17:36.362
We're the tasty treats
in the scenario.

17:36.429 --> 17:37.129
Yes, we're the tasty treats.

17:37.197 --> 17:38.731
They're going to take us out
into the open ocean... they're

17:38.798 --> 17:39.635
going to have their way with us, Mac.

17:39.755 --> 17:40.620
We got to get the hell out of here.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.111
Is this how you wanted
those poor women to feel?

17:42.231 --> 17:44.485
No. You know what, I don't enjoy
having this conversation with you.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.160
I feel like you're
lumping me in with them.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.922
Now, gentlemen, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

17:50.176 --> 17:52.211
The ladies have arrived.

17:52.278 --> 17:59.218
♪ I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time

17:59.285 --> 18:06.058
♪ Will open up again I'll be
back in the high life again... ♪

18:06.126 --> 18:08.827
Oh, Frank, you are absolutely right.

18:08.895 --> 18:10.162
This is boat music.

18:10.230 --> 18:13.165
Yeah, this is the kind of
music you ought to listen to.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.402
I am learning some amazing
moves from this guy.

18:17.871 --> 18:18.971
Yeah, you're doing great.

18:19.039 --> 18:20.472
You got the moves.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.574
Anybody want any more catfish?

18:22.642 --> 18:25.477
Yo, dude, definitely give
me another one of those.

18:25.545 --> 18:26.445
They're delicious.

18:26.513 --> 18:28.881
And you can taste that
sort of endangered tang.

18:28.948 --> 18:29.521
That's it.

18:29.641 --> 18:30.548
Oh, hold on.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.851
I'm getting a call.

18:32.919 --> 18:33.886
Hello.

18:33.953 --> 18:36.588
Hey, hey, Charlie, did you
guys ever find those keys?

18:36.656 --> 18:37.923
Yeah, man, I did actually.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.692
I did. Can you believe that.

18:39.759 --> 18:40.726
Okay, great.

18:40.794 --> 18:43.028
I need you to grab Frank and Dee
and get the hell out of there

18:43.096 --> 18:45.164
because we're going to be
bringing back a couple of tasty

18:45.231 --> 18:47.199
treats, if you know what I'm saying.

18:47.267 --> 18:48.567
Hey, man, yeah, absolutely.

18:48.635 --> 18:50.803
I'll get right on that.

18:50.870 --> 18:53.005
That's how you patronize
someone right there.

18:53.073 --> 18:54.606
What, what, what, what, what, what?

18:54.674 --> 18:55.307
Dennis being a dick.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.141
Don't worry about it, man.

18:56.209 --> 18:58.077
Hey, this scuba equipment's broken.

18:58.144 --> 18:58.911
It's useless.

18:58.978 --> 18:59.945
The hell with it.

19:00.013 --> 19:00.779
Let's get back to shrimping.

19:00.847 --> 19:01.814
I'm gonna toss this shit.

19:01.881 --> 19:03.882
It's crap anyway.

19:06.486 --> 19:08.887
Ooh, that's not good.

19:08.955 --> 19:13.592
Uh, hey, um, what do you
do if the boat is on fire?

19:13.660 --> 19:14.660
What do you mean?

19:14.728 --> 19:16.261
The boat is on fire.

19:16.329 --> 19:16.929
What?

19:16.996 --> 19:17.796
Oh, fire's getting bigger.

19:17.864 --> 19:18.664
What?!

19:18.732 --> 19:19.364
Fire's getting bigger.

19:19.432 --> 19:20.032
Go!

19:20.100 --> 19:20.699
Fire's getting big.

19:20.767 --> 19:21.433
Bail!

19:21.501 --> 19:22.301
Holy shit!

19:22.368 --> 19:23.068
Find some water.

19:23.136 --> 19:23.769
Find some water?!

19:23.837 --> 19:24.737
Find some water.

19:24.804 --> 19:26.205
What do you mean find some water?

19:26.272 --> 19:27.372
There's water everywhere.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.407
Help!

19:28.475 --> 19:30.409
Help us.

19:33.439 --> 19:37.449
I cannot wait to get you
ladies out into the sea.

19:37.517 --> 19:40.052
It's so much more romantic in
the middle of nowhere where we

19:40.120 --> 19:44.895
can be completely alone, and you can
make rash decisions based on fear.

19:45.015 --> 19:46.425
Right, Dennis?

19:47.106 --> 19:48.920
Yeah, yeah.

19:49.529 --> 19:51.563
Oh, wow, whoa, whoa.

19:53.266 --> 19:55.033
I thought we told you guys to beat it.

19:55.101 --> 19:56.401
Out of my way.

19:56.469 --> 19:58.036
No more Diddy boat.

19:58.104 --> 20:02.107
Damn catfish nipping at my heels all the w...
Endangered my ass.

20:02.175 --> 20:04.276
There's a billion of them out there.

20:04.344 --> 20:05.511
Ugh. What the hell happened?

20:05.578 --> 20:07.713
That was a hell of a swim.

20:07.781 --> 20:08.914
Charlie, where's the boat?

20:08.982 --> 20:10.182
What happened to the boat?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.184
It's right there.

20:18.558 --> 20:20.592
This was a terrible investment.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.594
Whew.
