I'm just a regular rapist.

09:54.286 --> 09:55.729
Nice to meet you?

09:55.730 --> 09:58.789
Drinks on my oafish, dull eyed friend!

09:58.790 --> 10:01.259
[All cheering]

10:01.260 --> 10:02.760
Maybe you should go easy.

10:02.761 --> 10:05.592
Don't you have a birthday
party appearance this afternoon?

10:05.593 --> 10:09.600
All taken care of! I
got a friend to fill in.

10:09.601 --> 10:11.867
[Screaming] [Bear roaring]

10:11.868 --> 10:15.771
Steve, my good boy, it's a
bit loud and raucous in here.

10:15.772 --> 10:20.512
Let's go somewhere
quiet where we can talk.

10:21.844 --> 10:24.334
Flamey, you know I love
you more than life itself,

10:24.335 --> 10:27.680
but maybe we should get back to the...

10:27.681 --> 10:29.182
Mr. Bear!

10:29.183 --> 10:33.953
It is an honor to have someone of
your stature in my humble titty bar.

10:33.954 --> 10:35.388
Here! You want to feel good?

10:35.389 --> 10:38.869
No, I'd rather feel great!

10:39.025 --> 10:40.826
Jesus Christ!

10:40.827 --> 10:42.761
Your friend put this in my g-string.

10:42.762 --> 10:45.497
"Steve owes you $20"?

10:45.498 --> 10:48.499
There's more where that came from!

10:48.500 --> 10:51.080
Give me those!

10:51.470 --> 10:54.906
Wow, did we have fun tonight. [Laughs]

10:54.907 --> 10:57.142
Now, maybe it's time to go home.

10:57.143 --> 11:02.183
Look at this, a trick
Wink Martindale taught me!

11:02.815 --> 11:04.361
Oh, oh!

11:04.362 --> 11:06.518
Beautiful fire!

11:06.519 --> 11:08.786
But Flamey, I thought you hated fire!

11:08.787 --> 11:11.489
Do I, Steven? Do I?

11:11.490 --> 11:14.492
Hey, what the... what the
[Bleep]? Hey! Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!

11:14.493 --> 11:16.828
- We gotta get you out of here!
- Nonsense!

11:16.829 --> 11:22.000
The night has just begun, and
the pills are just kicking in!

11:22.001 --> 11:23.335
What?

11:23.336 --> 11:25.496
[Screams]

11:27.740 --> 11:31.210
[Video game beeping] [Crash]

11:31.211 --> 11:33.813
- Oh, [Bleep]!
- [Glass breaks]

11:33.814 --> 11:35.849
Well, took care of that eye situation!

11:35.850 --> 11:38.741
Kind of got a little blind
spot from here to here,

11:38.742 --> 11:41.188
but hey, small price
to pay for good looks.

11:41.189 --> 11:43.857
Whoa! God damn, you do look good!

11:43.858 --> 11:45.725
You're just about perfect, Woody.

11:45.726 --> 11:48.259
"Just about"? What do
you mean, "just about"?

11:48.260 --> 11:50.839
Well, if I had godlike lips and eyes,

11:50.840 --> 11:54.300
I wouldn't want them competing for real
estate with my oversized nose and ears.

11:54.301 --> 11:56.869
I'd take those in just a smidge.

11:56.870 --> 11:59.305
All right, let's g... Oh, oh! [Grunts]

11:59.306 --> 12:05.206
Hey, Malloy, if you're gonna play with
my frozen hookers, at least put 'em back!

12:07.015 --> 12:08.603
- [Monitor beeping]
- It's touch and go.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.787
For 12 minutes, he was clinically dead.

12:10.788 --> 12:11.727
[Monitor flat lines]

12:11.728 --> 12:14.848
And he's dead, again.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.292
[Monitor beeping]

12:17.293 --> 12:19.092
And now, he's back.

12:19.093 --> 12:21.527
Do you think he can make it to
a forest opening at 9:00 A.M.?

12:21.528 --> 12:25.598
Yes, of course, that is, if
the forest opening is in hell.

12:25.599 --> 12:28.059
[Phone rings]

12:28.354 --> 12:30.303
Woody, I've got some really bad news.

12:30.304 --> 12:33.739
- Second wind!
- Uh, I'm gay.

12:33.740 --> 12:38.540
Come on, Steven, the
night is yo... [retches]

12:41.047 --> 12:41.983
[Grunts]

12:41.984 --> 12:45.851
Hold on. [Coughs] Some of
these pills are still intact.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.287
Allens-y, mon frere.

12:48.288 --> 12:50.721
- Ah!
- All right, Woody.

12:50.722 --> 12:53.859
Let's get a look at your brand new face.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.827
And, voila!

12:55.828 --> 12:59.631
Holy Christ, Malloy!
You were right! I...

12:59.632 --> 13:02.632
Am a goddamn Adonis!

13:03.330 --> 13:06.006
- [Zipper zips]
- Oh, thank God! Flamey, there you are.

13:06.007 --> 13:07.252
What are you doing out here?

13:07.253 --> 13:10.455
When I died, I saw a light.

13:10.456 --> 13:14.514
And in the light was my
dead mother, calling to me.

13:14.515 --> 13:17.050
And the words she called out were...

13:17.051 --> 13:18.856
Go buy some crack!

13:18.857 --> 13:20.587
Go buy some crack!

13:20.588 --> 13:23.456
Flamey, do not do all that crack!

13:23.457 --> 13:26.830
If you're that concerned
about my well being,

13:26.831 --> 13:31.497
maybe you should smoke
half of the crack for me.

13:31.498 --> 13:34.366
Oh, my God, I love crack!

13:34.367 --> 13:37.703
And he loves you back, just as I do!

13:37.704 --> 13:39.552
Really? Will you sign my record now?

13:39.553 --> 13:42.392
I'll go you one better! I'll show
you how to bed your ranger girl!

13:42.393 --> 13:43.947
It's quite simple. First you...

13:43.948 --> 13:45.678
Hey! You fat, furry fook!

13:45.679 --> 13:47.012
And you too, bear!

13:47.013 --> 13:49.648
You stuck me with the bar tab.

13:49.649 --> 13:51.483
You burned down my club!

13:51.484 --> 13:53.719
Your crappy insurance
barely paid your deductible.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.287
And you mauled my kids!

13:55.288 --> 13:58.623
In fairness, that wasn't Flamey. It
was a real bear he sent to your house.

13:58.624 --> 13:59.724
Ah, okay.

13:59.725 --> 14:01.559
Steven, our backs are against the wall.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.630
But they should have known better than to
cross the two musketeers! All for one...

14:05.631 --> 14:08.533
And one for... Flamey?

14:08.534 --> 14:09.701
Uh-oh.

14:09.702 --> 14:12.222
[All grunting]

14:15.908 --> 14:17.976
[Moaning] Oh, yeah.

14:17.977 --> 14:20.579
- Ooh, oh, yeah!
- Oh!

14:20.580 --> 14:23.715
Steven, old chap. Hey,
old fellow, well met!

14:23.716 --> 14:25.546
Flamey? Ethel?

14:25.547 --> 14:28.487
I told you I'd show
you how to bed Ethel.

14:28.488 --> 14:31.960
You do it like this. In, out...

14:31.961 --> 14:33.692
In, out...

14:33.693 --> 14:35.862
In, out...

14:35.863 --> 14:37.283
In!

14:37.284 --> 14:39.136
Out!

14:39.137 --> 14:40.449
[Music]

14:40.450 --> 14:42.918
- You okay, Steve?
- Am I okay?

14:42.919 --> 14:44.787
Am I okay? No!

14:44.788 --> 14:48.083
You just [Bleep] Flamey the Bear
on my Flamey the Bear sheets!

14:48.084 --> 14:49.751
I don't get why you're so upset, Steve.

14:49.752 --> 14:52.633
He told me you gave him the green
light since you and I are just friends.

14:52.634 --> 14:55.154
He said that? Excuse me, Ethel.

14:55.155 --> 14:58.601
I think it's high time I had
a little talk with my idol.

14:58.602 --> 15:00.536
Flamey, we have to talk.

15:00.537 --> 15:03.811
We do. I behaved horribly last night.

15:03.812 --> 15:07.076
And I deeply, truly apologize.

15:07.077 --> 15:10.613
Oh. Well, okay. But, still...

15:10.614 --> 15:14.524
We both know I can't un [Bleep] Ethel.

15:14.525 --> 15:19.188
But if it's any consolation,
I'd like to sign your album!

15:19.189 --> 15:22.369
That would mean a lot.

15:23.493 --> 15:28.830
Now, if I'm not mistaken, we have
an event to get to by 9:00 A.M.

15:28.831 --> 15:31.338
I believe this is yours.

15:31.339 --> 15:33.860
My Flamey the Bear vibrating fire fist?

15:33.861 --> 15:36.412
That's supposed to be
for punching out fires!

15:36.413 --> 15:39.952
It's also good for wrecking
your girlfriend's vagina.

15:39.953 --> 15:41.781
[Sploosh]

15:41.782 --> 15:43.916
The haircut looks great, Woody.

15:43.917 --> 15:47.119
And after you've had some
sun, you will be a ten.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.122
Al right. You're sure I haven't
been in the sun too long?

15:50.123 --> 15:53.526
Relax, Woody. It's called a base tan.

15:53.527 --> 15:56.462
It's just that I can't
really feel my skin anymore.

15:56.463 --> 16:00.723
Fine! I'll put some sunscreen on you.

16:02.169 --> 16:06.672
[Grunts] Malloy! I can't
move my arms or legs!

16:06.673 --> 16:08.374
[Sputtering]

16:08.375 --> 16:10.543
Ah, what the hell, Malloy?

16:10.544 --> 16:12.404
Aah!

16:12.768 --> 16:14.813
Look at the size of that fish!

16:14.814 --> 16:16.682
That sumbitch is huge!

16:16.683 --> 16:17.850
[Cameras clicking]

16:17.851 --> 16:21.253
Fish fry, my place, 7:00, bring a side.

16:21.254 --> 16:24.924
We are gonna need a
shit-load of tartar sauce.

16:24.925 --> 16:26.158
[Laughs]

16:26.159 --> 16:28.337
And remember the look
on that chap's face

16:28.338 --> 16:30.996
when he saw that flaming
urine coming at him?

16:30.997 --> 16:32.360
[Laughs]

16:32.361 --> 16:33.900
And then we smoked crack.

16:33.901 --> 16:36.269
Do you know where I can get
some more crack, by the way?

16:36.270 --> 16:37.581
[Laughs]

16:37.582 --> 16:39.538
You're a corker, my boy.

16:39.539 --> 16:41.273
No, really. I'd like
to buy some more crack.

16:41.274 --> 16:42.775
[Laughs] Oh, Steven.

16:42.776 --> 16:44.543
Pull over at this Stop n' Go.

16:44.544 --> 16:48.084
I'll buy us some breakfast.

16:48.348 --> 16:52.188
I'll be right back, old friend.

16:53.353 --> 16:55.654
"I had fun [Bleep] your girlfriend.

16:58.357 --> 17:00.697
That's it!

17:00.993 --> 17:03.261
All I've ever done is love you!

17:03.262 --> 17:06.298
And you're nothing but a
washed up, drunken asshole!

17:06.299 --> 17:08.133
You don't deserve to wear this suit.

17:08.134 --> 17:09.667
I hate you!

17:09.669 --> 17:14.205
I think I may be feeling regret
for the first time in my life.

17:14.207 --> 17:19.243
Does regret feel like numbness in your
left arm, and then a crushing chest pain?

17:19.244 --> 17:21.880
- No, I think that's a heart attack.
- [Grunts] Oh.

17:21.881 --> 17:24.761
Steven, I'm dying.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.055
Again.

17:27.220 --> 17:31.899
Take off my bear head, so
that I might look on you.

[Hiss]

17:38.297 --> 17:41.699
I actually do remember
meeting you at the Winn-Dixie.

17:41.700 --> 17:45.737
You were a stocky lad with
a misspelled Flamey shirt.

17:45.738 --> 17:47.572
Yeah, that was me.

17:47.573 --> 17:51.173
I remember, Steven, because...

17:51.199 --> 17:53.728
- Come closer.
- Yes? Tell me.

17:53.729 --> 17:57.335
I remember because I banged your mother

17:57.336 --> 17:59.918
in the back of your station wagon.

17:59.919 --> 18:03.488
Her face was jammed
into your booster seat.

18:03.489 --> 18:05.845
When she climaxed...

18:05.846 --> 18:09.195
She inhaled three goldfish...

all things considered. [Phone rings]

Steve, how's Flamey?

18:34.517 --> 18:38.118
He's dead... set on
making it a killer event.

18:38.119 --> 18:41.798
If he is not here in five
minutes, you are fired!

18:41.799 --> 18:45.289
Don't mess with me, Steve.
I've had a really hard day.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.750
[Tearing] Ow!

from us again, bear man!

Uh-oh.

And as some of you may have
seen, I can be a huge asshole.

a kid who needed a hero.

that hero turned out to be.

I gotta teach Sunday School.
