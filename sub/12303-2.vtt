00:14.250 --> 00:15.950
Mom, wake up!

00:16.050 --> 00:17.250
Wake up. We're on fire!

00:20.750 --> 00:23.650
Daddy!

00:23.850 --> 00:25.250
Ken, wait! What are you doing?

00:25.850 --> 00:26.650
Forget about the channel.

00:26.750 --> 00:27.450
There's a boat coming.

00:27.550 --> 00:28.250
They'll help us.

00:28.650 --> 00:29.850
We have to think about the kids.

00:29.950 --> 00:30.450
Trust me.

00:30.750 --> 00:31.750
I'm thinking of all of us.

00:35.750 --> 00:36.650
Oh, dear God.

00:41.950 --> 00:42.650
Where's Julie?

00:42.750 --> 00:43.450
I thought she was with you.

00:45.150 --> 00:46.350
Here! Take these!

00:46.450 --> 00:47.650
We have to jump!

00:55.350 --> 00:55.850
It's stuck!

00:56.150 --> 00:56.950
Propeller's stuck.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.350
Come on...Come on!

00:59.450 --> 01:00.150
We have to jump.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.550
We'll never make it to land!

01:01.750 --> 01:02.250
Oh, no way, Jules.

01:02.350 --> 01:02.950
That's crazy.

01:03.050 --> 01:04.349
Would you rather burn to death?!

01:10.050 --> 01:11.550
Julie, don't you dare!

01:11.750 --> 01:13.350
Jules, there's sharks out there!

01:13.450 --> 01:14.550
We're gonna die.

01:14.650 --> 01:15.950
It's our only chance.

01:19.750 --> 01:20.450
Jules, don't.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.050
Julie, no!

01:24.150 --> 01:24.850
Julie!

01:30.250 --> 01:31.350
Julie, just stay still.

01:34.650 --> 01:35.250
Julie?

01:35.450 --> 01:37.050
Honey, don't... don't move.

01:37.350 --> 01:38.350
Okay, just... just stay still.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.650
Oh, my God, Julie!

01:43.850 --> 01:44.350
No!

01:57.750 --> 01:59.450
Julie!

02:05.950 --> 02:07.450
Not a pretty sight, is it, Frank?

02:07.750 --> 02:09.850
No, but it beats the show this morning.

02:10.449 --> 02:12.550
20-year-old girl gets attacked by sharks.

02:12.850 --> 02:14.350
Older brother jumps in to save her.

02:14.550 --> 02:15.450
Both are missing.

02:15.650 --> 02:17.250
I think we have a better chance
of finding the brother.

02:17.450 --> 02:17.950
What else?

02:18.350 --> 02:19.650
Parents heard an explosion.

02:20.550 --> 02:22.250
Till we get onboard and process the scene,

02:22.450 --> 02:23.150
they're all we have.

02:23.950 --> 02:25.250
Ken and Laura Gannon.

02:26.150 --> 02:27.150
Tough way to lose your kids.

02:27.950 --> 02:29.750
Gannon got himself caught on a sandbar.

02:29.950 --> 02:30.550
Take a look at that.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.350
Frank, we got to move quick.

02:33.550 --> 02:37.450
The tide is rising and we have
a sinking crime scene.

02:37.550 --> 02:41.550
Yeah!

03:00.550 --> 03:03.050
We don't get fooled again

03:04.450 --> 03:06.750
Don't get fooled again

03:07.950 --> 03:09.050
No, no!

03:26.150 --> 03:30.050
Eric, the shark that attacked
the young girl was a bull shark.

03:30.650 --> 03:31.350
I think I'm covered.

03:31.550 --> 03:32.450
So I want you to be careful.

03:32.550 --> 03:33.250
Now listen to me.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.650
I want you to extend your
search up to the channel marker.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.050
Now, notice that marker is green.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.850
That should indicate that there's
a clear channel, shouldn't it?

03:41.950 --> 03:43.050
Shouldn't be a sandbar here.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.550
That's exactly my point.

03:44.650 --> 03:45.650
Okay, keep me posted.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.050
Please find our children.

03:57.150 --> 03:58.750
Mrs. Gannon, I've got my best diver on it.

03:58.850 --> 04:00.450
If they're out therewe'll find them, okay?

04:03.450 --> 04:07.850
What I'm gonna do is order
a reference sample from each of you, okay?

04:07.950 --> 04:08.750
We swab your cheeks.

04:08.850 --> 04:10.050
It's not a big deal.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.350
You mean in case they have to identify...

04:12.450 --> 04:13.750
That's right, standard procedure.

04:16.649 --> 04:17.149
It's okay.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.250
This was a smoke detector.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.450
Burn and char marks emanate
from the galley.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.050
That's where the fire started.

05:21.950 --> 05:22.750
Ship's sinking.

05:22.950 --> 05:23.950
We better work fast.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.050
Found our point of origin.

05:36.150 --> 05:36.750
Pour pattern.

05:37.150 --> 05:38.650
Which indicates an accelerant.

05:38.950 --> 05:41.750
Breeze through the broken window
acted as an oxidizer.

05:41.850 --> 05:43.050
All it needed was a spark.

05:43.350 --> 05:44.850
And you get a fire triangle.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.650
Piece of cloth and glass
at the point of origin.

06:03.550 --> 06:04.550
Molotov cocktail.

06:04.850 --> 06:05.350
Could be.

06:05.550 --> 06:06.350
What, no envelope?

06:06.750 --> 06:07.350
No time.

06:12.050 --> 06:12.950
Run and shoot, Ryan.

06:13.050 --> 06:14.250
Our crime scene's going under.

07:17.150 --> 07:18.150
Any sign of the young guy?

07:18.350 --> 07:20.150
No, because I had a little rip
current around that sandbar,

07:20.250 --> 07:21.650
must be about five knots.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.750
Okay, let's agreethat the current
took him away from the yacht;

07:23.850 --> 07:24.950
we follow the Gulf Stream.

07:25.050 --> 07:26.050
I'll have AV work on that.

07:26.150 --> 07:27.350
I wanted to get this to you first.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.750
That boat grounding was no accident.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.550
Original anchor chain was cut,

07:31.650 --> 07:33.250
and whatever it's mounted to now is new.

07:34.350 --> 07:34.850
Now, look at this.

07:34.950 --> 07:35.750
You see how clean it is?

07:35.950 --> 07:38.550
Not a blade of seaweed,
hasn't been there more than a day.

07:38.650 --> 07:40.550
Eric, somebody moved that buoy.

07:43.850 --> 07:44.950
That marker meant we were in the channel.

07:45.450 --> 07:46.550
I know these waters, Lieutenant.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.550
Who would do something like that?

07:50.150 --> 07:52.250
Well, that's what we're going
to find out, Mrs. Gannon.

07:54.150 --> 07:55.550
There was a ship in the area.

07:57.450 --> 07:58.550
Did you get a look at it?

08:00.350 --> 08:00.850
I did.

08:01.850 --> 08:02.750
It was blue,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.650
I think, the hull, I mean.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.150
Do you remember anything else about it?

08:08.350 --> 08:09.250
The ship's name.

08:14.350 --> 08:15.550
It was the Helen B.

08:16.150 --> 08:18.050
I remember because my mother's
name was Helen.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.350
I guess...

08:21.250 --> 08:22.650
I guess I'm a little confused.

08:22.750 --> 08:23.850
There was a boat in the area,

08:23.950 --> 08:25.350
and yet you steered away from it.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.350
Yes.

08:31.950 --> 08:33.350
- You ignored help.
- Help?

08:34.450 --> 08:35.549
That ship was a salvager.

08:35.650 --> 08:36.650
They prey on people like us.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.950
Ask anyone at the yacht club.

08:38.950 --> 08:40.850
A couple we know accepted
a tow from one last year.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.950
Week later, they got a bill
for half a million dollars.

08:43.049 --> 08:45.550
Well, I bet that half a million
looks like bargain now.

08:57.750 --> 08:58.250
Can I help you?

08:58.950 --> 09:00.350
You're captain of the Helen B?

09:00.750 --> 09:02.850
Rex Hoby. Pleasure.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.150
Where's your crew today, Mr. Hoby?

09:05.550 --> 09:06.350
Sent them home.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.850
But they did work earlier today, didn't they?

09:11.150 --> 09:14.950
Mr. Hoby, I have a witness that
can place you at that sinking yacht.

09:15.650 --> 09:18.750
My crew and I offered help
to a boat in distress,

09:19.350 --> 09:20.750
help which was refused.

09:20.850 --> 09:22.950
For which you expected
fair compensation, right?

09:23.450 --> 09:24.050
Yeah.

09:24.550 --> 09:26.650
Rules of maritime salvage.

09:26.950 --> 09:28.950
And it was just pure chance
that you were there.

09:36.950 --> 09:38.050
Speak on it, Lieutenant.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.950
Here's what I think happened, Mr. Hoby.

09:41.050 --> 09:43.950
You and your crew used
that torch and that chain

09:44.050 --> 09:47.350
and moved a channel marker in
the hopes that a yacht would run aground,

09:47.450 --> 09:48.350
because that's what you do--

09:48.450 --> 09:49.550
you lay in wait.

09:57.550 --> 10:00.250
Must be hundreds of us out
there with chains like that.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.350
And a cutting torch.

10:03.350 --> 10:04.450
Part of the trade.

10:05.150 --> 10:07.850
Yes, but how many of you
use a Molotov cocktail?

10:09.150 --> 10:12.050
I was there to help this morning, Lieutenant...

10:12.350 --> 10:13.650
for profit, sure,

10:14.650 --> 10:16.150
but to destroy a vessel?

10:16.850 --> 10:17.650
No way.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.550
That would be taking money out of my pocket.

10:21.650 --> 10:22.550
But I'll tell you, though...

10:24.450 --> 10:26.750
I never will forget that girl's scream.

10:27.250 --> 10:30.350
Mr. Hoby, I can imagine the sleep you're losing.

10:48.450 --> 10:49.550
Anger management?

10:49.750 --> 10:50.650
Just an experiment.

10:53.550 --> 10:57.450
- You're trying to create pour patterns
that we found on the yacht. - Yeah.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.250
You know, the whole
Molotov cocktail thing bothered me.

11:02.550 --> 11:03.250
I'm listening.

11:04.050 --> 11:04.750
Well, the pour patterns--

11:04.850 --> 11:05.750
they didn't fit.

11:10.450 --> 11:11.150
Here, I'll show you.

11:19.750 --> 11:20.650
They were uniform,

11:21.050 --> 11:26.250
which means the blast emanated from a central point
was caused by an object that was dropped straight down.

11:26.650 --> 11:27.450
Was not thrown.

11:28.150 --> 11:30.050
So there was no Molotov cocktail?

11:31.250 --> 11:32.450
We're back at square one.

11:32.850 --> 11:33.650
Not exactly.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.150
I know what the accelerant is.

11:35.550 --> 11:36.650
Diethylene glycol.

11:37.950 --> 11:38.850
That's cooking fuel, isn't it?

11:38.950 --> 11:39.450
Mm-hmm.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.650
Explains why the fire was started in the galley.

11:43.850 --> 11:45.550
Now we know it was by someone on the yacht.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.750
Suspect pool is very small.

11:49.350 --> 11:51.250
One of the kids or one of the parents.

12:00.350 --> 12:01.750
Got the program running now, Eric.

12:02.650 --> 12:08.250
Calculating the approximate time the body entered
the water against the speed of the specific current.

12:10.550 --> 12:13.050
We should be able to determine
its approximate location.

12:15.350 --> 12:17.050
All right, now would be good.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.250
Working on it, big man.

12:24.950 --> 12:25.950
Talk to me, Cooper.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.250
A little north of where I originally thought.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.250
Okay, where am I headed now?

12:31.850 --> 12:34.450
300 yards off Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.050
I just sent you the coordinates.

12:36.450 --> 12:37.550
Great work, Dan. Thanks.

12:37.950 --> 12:38.550
I appreciate it.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.250
Okay, Alexx.

14:07.450 --> 14:08.150
That's not our son.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.050
That means Luke is still out there.

14:14.850 --> 14:15.450
He's right, ma'am.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.450
We'll take it from here.

14:21.650 --> 14:22.350
If you'll excuse us.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.350
Alexx, if this is not their son,

14:31.450 --> 14:32.150
who is this?

14:32.750 --> 14:34.650
I don't know who this boy is, Horatio.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.650
But there's one thing I do know.

14:37.350 --> 14:38.950
These are burn marks on his body.

14:39.450 --> 14:40.150
Look at the char.

14:40.350 --> 14:41.350
Which means he was on the boat.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.850
It also means someone is lying.

14:57.750 --> 14:58.250
Hey...

14:58.650 --> 15:00.550
any info on our John Doe from the water?

15:02.950 --> 15:04.550
No soot in his lungs,

15:04.850 --> 15:06.150
no esophageal burning.

15:07.350 --> 15:09.450
He was already dead when he got
on the Gannons' boat.

15:11.750 --> 15:12.950
Look at my boy.

15:13.150 --> 15:14.650
All growed up.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.150
So, uh...

15:18.050 --> 15:18.850
what killed him?

15:19.850 --> 15:20.750
Someone shot him.

15:21.150 --> 15:22.550
Hit him right in the chest.

15:28.150 --> 15:29.350
Looks like a .25.

15:31.150 --> 15:32.150
You think we can ID him?

15:33.450 --> 15:34.550
It may take a little work.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.250
Hmm, lucky the sharks didn't have at his hands.

15:41.950 --> 15:44.050
But we're still a long way from a usable print.

15:45.350 --> 15:46.450
You want me to hold or cut?

15:47.350 --> 15:48.250
I'll cut.

16:02.150 --> 16:02.950
Damn.

16:04.150 --> 16:04.850
Everything okay?

16:05.750 --> 16:07.850
My Firearms Proficiency is up.

16:07.950 --> 16:09.350
Six months goes by fast.

16:09.450 --> 16:10.350
Well, you left Firearms,

16:10.450 --> 16:11.650
so it's not such a big deal, is it?

16:11.850 --> 16:12.650
I like to stay current.

16:15.150 --> 16:16.850
Calleigh, did you quit because
Hagen died in there?

16:17.650 --> 16:18.250
I transferred.

16:20.050 --> 16:22.450
But, yeah, all of a sudden,
evidence isn't just evidence.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.250
What have you got?

16:24.350 --> 16:25.450
This? This is just work.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.250
Good luck on your test.

16:27.950 --> 16:28.450
Thanks.

16:32.150 --> 16:32.950
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.150
So, now what?

16:34.850 --> 16:37.750
Well, some analysts like to use water

16:37.850 --> 16:39.450
or glycerine to reconstitute prints,

16:39.550 --> 16:41.550
but, uh, too much leakage.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.050
I like tissue builder.

16:44.550 --> 16:45.250
It's time to get busy.

17:33.550 --> 17:34.550
No luck on AFIS.

17:35.650 --> 17:36.750
Let's check Immigration.

17:42.150 --> 17:43.450
Immigration database got a hit.

17:44.850 --> 17:45.850
Damon Loughlin.

17:46.850 --> 17:48.050
He's here on a student visa.

17:49.050 --> 17:51.450
That doesn't explain how
he ended up on the Gannons' boat.

17:57.850 --> 18:01.350
We were able to identify
the young man that we found in the water.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.250
You know him, don't you, Mrs. Gannon?

18:12.050 --> 18:12.750
That's Damon.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.550
He didn't look anything like that at the pier.

18:16.050 --> 18:17.850
His burns are consistent with the fire.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.150
He started the fire?

18:20.250 --> 18:20.850
No, ma'am,

18:20.950 --> 18:22.550
he was dead before the fire.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.150
He went down with the boat,

18:24.250 --> 18:25.950
and the current took him out to sea.

18:26.050 --> 18:28.950
I'm curious as to how you know him.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.150
I think my daughter Julie was seeing him.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.150
But you're not sure.

18:33.650 --> 18:35.650
At their age, they don't tell their mothers much.

18:36.150 --> 18:36.750
Horatio?

18:40.150 --> 18:40.850
Excuse me.

18:42.250 --> 18:42.750
Yes, ma'am.

18:42.850 --> 18:45.950
Homicide ran the student visa of Damon Loughlin.

18:46.050 --> 18:48.250
He's a house-sitter for a family
by the name of Elias.

18:48.350 --> 18:49.350
The live in Coconut Grove.

18:49.450 --> 18:50.650
Have you contacted them?

18:51.050 --> 18:52.950
They were on their yacht
at the yacht club all weekend.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.050
You want to guess which one?

18:54.150 --> 18:55.750
The Mayfair Yacht Club.

18:55.850 --> 18:56.650
Same as the Gannons.

18:56.750 --> 18:57.950
Okay, very good.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.050
Talk to the Eliases,

18:59.150 --> 19:01.750
- and I'll stay with Mom.
- Okay.

19:16.450 --> 19:18.650
Mr. Elias, thank you for coming so soon.

19:18.950 --> 19:19.650
What's happened?

19:20.350 --> 19:21.150
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.050
This is Ryan Wolfe.

19:22.150 --> 19:23.150
We're with the Crime Lab.

19:23.850 --> 19:25.150
We'd like to see Damon's room.

19:25.550 --> 19:26.150
Please come on in.

19:30.450 --> 19:31.450
Dad, what's going on?

19:32.350 --> 19:33.350
I don't know yet, Tia.

19:37.950 --> 19:38.550
Oh, my God!

19:43.150 --> 19:44.050
Is Damon okay?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.550
Uh, no, I'm afraid he's not.

19:47.750 --> 19:48.650
This is a crime scene.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.250
You're going to have to stay outside.

19:51.150 --> 19:53.350
I have, uh, valuables in the house.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.050
Is there any way I could check on them?

19:55.450 --> 19:56.950
We'll have someone escort you in.

19:57.150 --> 19:58.650
Would you take them around back, please, Officer?

20:15.050 --> 20:17.150
Well, I think it's safe to say
this is where Damon was shot.

20:28.550 --> 20:29.750
The bullet was in the body, right?

20:31.650 --> 20:33.750
Right. So there might be
a casing around here somewhere.

20:41.350 --> 20:42.050
Found it.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.050
I'll take it to Firearms.

20:52.750 --> 20:53.250
Thank you.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.850
Okay, let's go talk to Mr. Elias.

20:57.950 --> 20:59.650
Mr. Elias, can we speak to you, please?

21:00.150 --> 21:00.950
Anything missing?

21:01.750 --> 21:02.450
Our gold.

21:04.350 --> 21:04.950
Gold?

21:05.150 --> 21:05.650
How much?

21:06.350 --> 21:08.450
Ten million dollars... in bars.

21:09.650 --> 21:12.550
Ten million dollars in gold bars?

21:12.650 --> 21:13.650
That is correct.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.250
I do not trust banks.

21:17.950 --> 21:18.950
My laptop's gone.

21:20.050 --> 21:21.950
You're going to need to write
all of that down on this form.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.050
Do you know the Gannon family?

21:26.550 --> 21:28.050
Tia used to date their son.

21:29.150 --> 21:29.750
Really?

21:30.650 --> 21:31.150
Why?

21:31.550 --> 21:33.150
Because Damon was shot here,

21:33.250 --> 21:34.550
and then, he was put on their boat.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.950
Tia, why did you stop dating the Gannon boy?

21:43.750 --> 21:45.150
Luke and I just drifted apart.

21:45.850 --> 21:46.550
Why?

21:47.650 --> 21:49.550
Do you think I had something to do with this?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.850
Investigation's on going.

21:52.050 --> 21:52.650
We'll let you know.

21:54.050 --> 21:54.450
Thank you.

22:03.150 --> 22:03.750
You again.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.150
Just like a bad penny, huh?

22:08.650 --> 22:10.250
Noticed those dive suits.

22:10.350 --> 22:11.250
They weren't here this morning.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.350
They dry better above deck.

22:13.650 --> 22:16.250
I also noticed the burn residue on them.

22:16.950 --> 22:19.550
And your shiny new trunk.

22:19.950 --> 22:20.950
Taking a little trip.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.150
- Packed a few things.
- Open it.

22:33.450 --> 22:35.050
So here's what I think happened, Rex.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.150
After the yacht sank off the sandbar,

22:37.250 --> 22:38.250
you unloaded the gold

22:38.350 --> 22:40.350
and that's where you gotthe burn residue, right?

22:52.650 --> 22:53.350
That's mine.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.950
Owner granted me salvage rights.

22:58.050 --> 23:00.750
The owner reported it stolen from his home, Rex.

23:01.150 --> 23:02.250
So where did you get it?

23:06.950 --> 23:07.550
From me.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.150
Luke Gannon, alive and well.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.150
Yeah, thanks to this guy.

23:14.950 --> 23:17.650
Probably had about ten minutes of fight
left before he pulled me out of the water.

23:18.050 --> 23:20.650
So he got ten million for saving your neck, huh?

23:21.950 --> 23:24.750
Law of the sea: any family member
can grant scuttle rights.

23:25.050 --> 23:26.450
Besides, I had no idea it was there.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.950
Dad headed to shore instead of
trying to save me or Julie,

23:30.050 --> 23:31.350
so I don't owe him squat.

23:31.850 --> 23:33.050
Yes, but now you owe me.

23:33.650 --> 23:34.450
Come over here.

23:35.250 --> 23:36.650
Oww...

23:40.950 --> 23:43.050
All I did was jump in and try and save my sister.

23:43.150 --> 23:44.850
That's the way you wanted it to look.

23:44.950 --> 23:45.550
You're wrong.

23:45.850 --> 23:46.450
Am I?

23:46.950 --> 23:48.950
You torched the ship; it sank;

23:49.150 --> 23:50.150
the salvager scuttled it;

23:50.250 --> 23:51.550
you guys split the take.

23:51.650 --> 23:52.450
Never happened.

23:52.550 --> 23:53.750
We found Damon Loughlin's body.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.350
That's gonna tie you to the Elias' house,

23:55.450 --> 23:56.550
the kidnapping and the murder.

23:57.250 --> 23:58.250
Why would I kill him?

23:58.350 --> 24:01.250
OK, Because he tried to prevent
you from taking the gold.

24:03.850 --> 24:04.650
Do you have any proof of that?

24:05.550 --> 24:06.750
Do not test me.

24:36.550 --> 24:40.050
Hey, making some progress on
the glass you collected from the yacht,

24:40.150 --> 24:41.650
but I still have no idea what I'm looking at.

24:41.750 --> 24:42.550
This might help.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.050
I scraped a sample off the glass.

24:49.450 --> 24:50.250
THC.

24:51.150 --> 24:52.550
Active ingredient in marijuana.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.850
It was bong filled with cooking fuel,

24:54.950 --> 24:56.250
but when someone lit up,

24:57.250 --> 24:58.350
the boat went up instead.

25:02.450 --> 25:05.050
And that makes this hole the choke.

25:06.950 --> 25:09.550
You have to cover it with your finger
to collect the smoke in the chamber.

25:11.350 --> 25:13.250
Or to keep the cooking fuel from spilling out.

25:14.450 --> 25:15.350
Could give us prints.

25:15.750 --> 25:16.550
I'll get it to Delko.

25:16.650 --> 25:17.250
Yeah, do that.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.550
But I think I know who the owner of this bong is.

25:23.650 --> 25:25.150
So I smoke a little dope.

25:26.050 --> 25:26.650
Big deal.

25:28.550 --> 25:30.750
Someone put cooking fuel in your bong, Luke.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.250
Well, that explains what happened.

25:35.950 --> 25:36.950
Second I saw the fire,

25:37.050 --> 25:37.750
I dropped it.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.350
My parents were asleep below deck.

25:43.850 --> 25:44.950
I sneak a bong hit before bed every night.

25:49.350 --> 25:51.250
Whoa! Mom! Dad! Fire!

25:52.950 --> 25:54.950
Do you have any idea who'd try to burn you?

25:58.550 --> 26:00.250
Well, feel kind of bad saying this, but, uh...

26:01.150 --> 26:02.250
my mom might have.

26:06.050 --> 26:07.750
You think your mom tried to do this to you?

26:07.950 --> 26:10.350
She hates the fact we're not the perfect family.

26:11.550 --> 26:13.250
Got caught smoking a couple times.

26:13.950 --> 26:15.550
Dad didn't like it, but he dealt.

26:17.950 --> 26:19.250
My mom went ballistic.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.050
You think she was trying to teach you a lesson?

26:25.250 --> 26:25.950
Tough love?

26:29.950 --> 26:31.350
I wouldn't put anything past her.

26:41.150 --> 26:42.050
Anything with the bong?

26:42.850 --> 26:44.550
Well, I lifted a beauty of a print.

26:47.350 --> 26:48.150
Come from the mother?

26:49.150 --> 26:49.650
Nope.

26:49.850 --> 26:52.850
In fact, didn't get a hit on any of the Gannons.

26:55.250 --> 26:58.150
Maybe it wasn't just his family
that didn't approve of his little habit.

27:01.150 --> 27:02.850
Try this. We got this from his ex-girlfriend.

27:03.750 --> 27:04.750
She handled this form.

27:36.450 --> 27:37.650
Look at this shoe right here.

27:37.950 --> 27:38.450
It looks exactly like...

27:38.550 --> 27:40.250
Tia, can I speak with you, please?

27:41.150 --> 27:41.750
What's up?

27:42.750 --> 27:43.450
Just take a look.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.050
That's your print.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.150
Why'd you pour the cooking fuel in there, Tia?

28:12.550 --> 28:14.750
You know, I talked to some
girls down at the yacht club,

28:15.750 --> 28:17.650
and they said you and Luke didn't drift apart.

28:19.050 --> 28:20.050
So why'd you break up?

28:21.950 --> 28:23.250
You expect a guy to cheat,

28:24.050 --> 28:26.750
but this... was too weird.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.450
You're gonna have to be a
little more specific, Tia.

28:30.650 --> 28:32.450
I caught him with his sister last week.

28:33.250 --> 28:33.950
With her how?

28:36.150 --> 28:38.450
In bed. Doing it.

28:47.950 --> 28:49.050
I felt sick.

28:50.050 --> 28:51.350
I knew he got high every night.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.250
I just wanted to hurt him like he hurt me.

29:14.950 --> 29:15.950
Well, you sunk a yacht,

29:16.350 --> 29:18.450
and you contributed to the death of Julie Gannon.

29:19.350 --> 29:20.250
And that's manslaughter.

29:24.150 --> 29:25.950
So Tia Elias caused the fire.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.650
And had nothing to do with
Damon's murder or the gold.

29:29.050 --> 29:30.550
In fact, her motive was odd, though.

29:30.650 --> 29:31.650
Which would be what?

29:31.750 --> 29:34.250
She says she caught the Gannon
siblings in bed together.

29:34.350 --> 29:35.350
That's pretty deviant behavior.

29:35.450 --> 29:37.950
I would agree, but there may
be another explanation.

29:38.050 --> 29:39.650
- Like what?
- Here's what I want you to do.

29:39.850 --> 29:42.350
Have Eric run the Gannon family nationally.

29:42.550 --> 29:43.550
For priors? Okay.

29:46.550 --> 29:47.650
I ran the family nationally.

29:47.750 --> 29:50.250
The kids each had at least five offenses.

29:50.350 --> 29:52.550
Fraud, forgery, check kiting.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.750
These two-- they're not brother and sister at all.

29:56.150 --> 29:58.350
They are not college age, either, are they?

29:58.850 --> 30:01.450
No, he's 24 and she was 23.

30:02.650 --> 30:03.650
Run the parents.

30:05.950 --> 30:06.750
The parents.

30:07.150 --> 30:08.350
Here we go. One's clean;

30:08.450 --> 30:10.850
the other one has a sheet longer
than the kids' combined.

30:10.950 --> 30:12.450
- No convictions.
- Not yet.

30:15.550 --> 30:18.450
I understand that you've been with
your husband Kenfor only three years.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.450
My first husband passed away.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.250
I went to a bereavement group and Ken was there.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.250
His wife had just died of cancer.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.450
And you were there for Ken.

30:28.650 --> 30:29.750
He was there for me, too.

30:30.550 --> 30:31.150
If it wasn't for him,

30:31.250 --> 30:32.950
I don't know I could have gotten by.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.150
I have some bad news for you.

30:39.950 --> 30:45.050
These are all... Ken.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.450
I don't understand.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.750
Are these... real?

30:58.550 --> 30:59.450
I'm afraid so.

31:02.750 --> 31:03.950
Well, what about the kids?

31:04.550 --> 31:05.550
When I first met Ken,

31:05.650 --> 31:08.450
he was so concerned about me
getting along with his two teenagers.

31:10.350 --> 31:14.250
The children are not related
to each other or to Ken.

31:21.090 --> 31:22.190
Mrs. Gannon, I don't know

31:22.290 --> 31:26.790
how to tell you this other than they
used you to gain entry to the yacht club.

31:29.190 --> 31:30.390
For the Elias' gold?

31:30.490 --> 31:30.990
Mm-hmm.

31:33.390 --> 31:34.290
I am such a fool.

31:34.390 --> 31:35.490
Mrs. Gannon, you're not a fool.

31:35.590 --> 31:36.590
These are pros.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.090
This is what they do for a living.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.090
How can I go home?

31:41.390 --> 31:42.090
You can't.

31:42.490 --> 31:44.890
These are dangerous people
with nothing left to lose.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.690
We do have one advantage.

31:49.890 --> 31:52.490
They don't know we're on to them yet.

32:04.040 --> 32:04.740
You found my son.

32:04.940 --> 32:06.140
Yes, we did.

32:07.340 --> 32:08.740
Except he's not your son.

32:13.540 --> 32:18.040
Mr. Gannon, you have an arrest record
that spans back some 15 years now.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.040
That's quite a resume.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.040
Arrests, no convictions. You through?

32:25.040 --> 32:29.840
Your wife Laura mentioned that you had met
in a bereavement class in which you stated

32:30.040 --> 32:31.840
that you'd lost a wife to cancer,

32:31.940 --> 32:33.040
but in truth,

32:34.140 --> 32:35.240
there is no wife;

32:35.440 --> 32:37.740
there was no cancer and no family.

32:40.440 --> 32:43.640
So you're going to arrest me
for lying to my wife?

32:45.340 --> 32:47.540
You used Laura to meet the Eliases,

32:47.640 --> 32:49.940
sent your bogus son to date their daughter

32:50.040 --> 32:52.940
so you could steal their gold.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.240
Too bad that's all you got.

32:58.840 --> 32:59.340
We're done.

33:00.740 --> 33:01.340
For now.

33:08.940 --> 33:09.640
Guy's gonna walk?

33:09.840 --> 33:10.840
Not for long.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.540
How did Laura Gannon's
first husband die, Frank?

33:14.240 --> 33:15.440
Car accident three years ago.

33:15.540 --> 33:16.040
Why?

33:16.440 --> 33:19.240
Let's pull the file and get
the VIN number on the vehicle.

33:19.640 --> 33:20.740
Tow it in if we find it?

33:22.440 --> 33:23.640
First things first.

33:45.040 --> 33:45.740
Hey, Calleigh.

33:47.340 --> 33:48.340
Did you come by for your stuff?

33:49.640 --> 33:51.340
I got it in a box around here somewhere.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.240
Oh, that's okay, Jim.

33:53.340 --> 33:55.040
I'll just have to get it some other time.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.840
So what brings you by?

33:58.640 --> 33:59.840
Proficiencies.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.240
I'm on a deadline.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.139
That casing--is it from the Elias house?

34:10.540 --> 34:12.239
Yes. Why?

34:12.840 --> 34:16.739
Is there any reason in particular
why you didn't collect the evidence off it?

34:17.840 --> 34:19.040
It could contain DNA.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.639
Well, there is something fused to that casing.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.139
I'll have to get on that.

34:42.440 --> 34:43.139
What are you doing?

34:44.239 --> 34:45.540
Horatio's got a suspect on ice.

34:45.639 --> 34:46.940
He won't stay that way forever.

34:47.340 --> 34:48.440
I'm taking this to DNA.

34:49.340 --> 34:51.840
Okay, but this is my lab now.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.440
All due respect, this is my evidence.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.440
You want the results, they'll be in DNA.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.240
We discovered something at the Eliases.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.240
Oh, yeah? What?

35:09.540 --> 35:15.040
We found skin tissue on a shell casing
from the Damon Loughlin shooting.

35:16.840 --> 35:17.840
Well, could be my sister's.

35:20.240 --> 35:20.840
Julie?

35:22.440 --> 35:24.040
Yeah, we went there together, me and Julie.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.240
Come on. Hurry up.
We've got to get out of here.

35:28.940 --> 35:29.940
Don't go any further.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.040
Give it to me.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.240
Please.

35:45.040 --> 35:45.640
Julie!

35:51.640 --> 35:53.040
Except she's not your sister.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.440
And besides, it doesn't
really matter who shot him.

36:00.540 --> 36:01.140
You were both there;

36:01.240 --> 36:02.440
it's felony murder.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.440
Okay... then I wasn't there.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.840
And you can't prove that I was.

36:14.740 --> 36:15.640
Actually, I can.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.240
May I see your hands please?

36:18.040 --> 36:18.540
Excuse me?

36:19.140 --> 36:20.240
Put your hands on the table.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.440
When you went to pick up the casing,

36:30.940 --> 36:31.940
you burnt your finger.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.140
We have your DNA.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.440
Julie!

36:43.240 --> 36:43.740
Ow!

36:50.940 --> 36:51.740
It's all over, Luke.

36:57.640 --> 37:01.140
I used the VIN number to find the car
that Mrs. Gannon's first husband was killed in.

37:02.540 --> 37:04.340
It's a Mercedes E55.

37:04.740 --> 37:05.640
That's a fast car.

37:06.040 --> 37:06.540
Yeah.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.340
Insurance company totaled it
and sold it to a wholesaler.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.340
Wholesaler flipped it and sold it to a...

37:14.240 --> 37:15.440
Luis Cruz.

37:15.940 --> 37:17.440
What was the cause of the accident?

37:22.140 --> 37:23.340
Excessive speed.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.140
According to witnesses,
Mrs. Gannon's late husband,

37:27.240 --> 37:28.140
a Philip Reynolds,

37:28.240 --> 37:31.340
was traveling too fast to navigate
a turn not too far from his office.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.640
Says here he may have hit
the gas instead of the brake.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.540
Ran head-on into a stone wall.

37:36.940 --> 37:38.240
He was pronounced at the scene.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.240
Looks like, to me,
it was just a freak accident.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.340
Or the perfect crime.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.140
Did You know Philip Reynolds, Luis?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.440
He was killed three years ago.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.940
No, I don't know him.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.340
But you bought the car
from his insurance company.

37:57.640 --> 37:58.440
Yeah, so?

37:58.540 --> 37:59.640
You can't just take my car.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.640
As a matter of fact, I can, Luis.

38:02.940 --> 38:03.640
What is this?

38:03.740 --> 38:06.740
That document allows me
to take possession of your vehicle.

38:08.540 --> 38:11.440
- I suppose you want my license and my registra...
- Just want your keys.

38:15.540 --> 38:16.040
Thank you.

38:16.340 --> 38:16.840
Let's go.

38:56.640 --> 38:57.340
Bingo.

39:00.340 --> 39:00.940
Eric.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.840
That car was definitely tampered with.

39:04.540 --> 39:07.840
This switch was part of a small assembly
rigged to the cruise control.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.940
You'd have never known it was
there unless you looked for it.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.340
It's a clever piece of work.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.740
Can we tie it to Gannon?

39:13.540 --> 39:14.540
I'm just getting started.

39:14.940 --> 39:15.840
Okay. Find me.

40:00.340 --> 40:02.740
H... I got it.

40:04.540 --> 40:07.740
Mr. Gannon, have a seat.

40:11.540 --> 40:12.540
And while you're at it,

40:14.340 --> 40:15.340
why don't you take a look at that.

40:15.940 --> 40:17.340
An electrical device?

40:18.940 --> 40:19.540
So?

40:20.640 --> 40:23.740
So we found it in a car that
belonged to your wife's late husband,

40:23.840 --> 40:24.840
Philip Reynolds.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.440
You planted it there.

40:27.540 --> 40:28.340
Fascinating.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.840
Laura was the perfect mark, wasn't she?

40:37.440 --> 40:39.440
She gave you ongoing accessto the yacht club

40:39.540 --> 40:42.540
and to rich people who brag about their wealth.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.940
Yes, the yacht club.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.340
The paradise for grifters
just like you and your kids.

40:49.140 --> 40:50.940
But first you needed to get rid of the husband.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.640
So you learned that he worked late each night,

40:53.740 --> 40:55.240
came home around the same time.

40:57.740 --> 41:00.440
About a half a mile from
his office there's a left turn.

41:01.140 --> 41:02.940
When he got to the corner, he signaled.

41:04.340 --> 41:06.740
Turn signal activated a switch.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.640
That switch overrode the cruise control,

41:13.740 --> 41:14.440
turning it on,

41:15.440 --> 41:17.840
closing a solenoid,
which locked the brake pedalin place.

41:21.340 --> 41:23.440
And that sent the car accelerating out of control.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.940
Now you knew there was no way
he could make that curve.

41:32.940 --> 41:33.840
Nice theory.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.240
It's more than a theory.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.440
You were careful,

41:38.640 --> 41:39.940
but not careful enough.

41:41.440 --> 41:44.540
You did a good job of wiping up your handiwork.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.740
There was one print you couldn't wipe off.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.840
Stuck between layers of adhesive.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.140
Like a fossil.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.340
Preserved...

42:03.140 --> 42:04.340
for us to find.

42:07.140 --> 42:09.840
Oh. You're under arrest.

42:15.340 --> 42:16.140
Mrs. Gannon?

42:19.340 --> 42:20.040
Mrs. Gannon?

42:27.040 --> 42:29.040
Why couldn't I see them
for who they really were?

42:30.640 --> 42:31.440
Strangers.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.140
Worse.

42:40.740 --> 42:42.240
All I wanted was family.

42:43.940 --> 42:44.840
What's wrong with me?

42:48.640 --> 42:49.240
Nothing.

42:52.740 --> 42:55.440
Family is what we all want.
