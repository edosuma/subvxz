MR CUNNINGHAM:
Good afternoon, boys
and girls, and welcome to...

00:07.640 --> 00:09.175
Detention.

00:09.242 --> 00:12.112
Now, I want to be here
about as much as you do,

00:12.178 --> 00:14.147
so the sooner you get
your homework done,

00:14.214 --> 00:15.882
the sooner we can all go home.

00:17.083 --> 00:20.920
-Jacob, are you okay?
-Yeah.

00:20.987 --> 00:23.223
Well, Mrs Pitman
tells me you got
into a fight this lunchtime.

00:23.289 --> 00:25.792
-Now, that doesn't
sound like you.
-No?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.761
What am I like, then,
Mr Cunningham?

00:27.827 --> 00:32.499
Well, you're a good kid.
You're smart, funny...

00:32.564 --> 00:35.668
-Is there
anything wrong at home?
-No. Everything's fine.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.604
MR CUNNINGHAM: Okay.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.806
Well, you know
you can always talk to me
if you've got a problem.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.108
I've just told you, haven't I?
I'm all right.

00:42.175 --> 00:44.344
-(COUGHING) Freak.
-What was that?

00:44.411 --> 00:46.379
All right, Steve,
that's enough.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.615
-Jacob, turn round
and get on with your work.
-What did you call me?

00:48.681 --> 00:51.484
Me? Nothing. I...

00:51.551 --> 00:53.486
Hey, I've asked you once.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.890
Now, both of you,
be quiet and get
on with your work.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.161
-(COUGHING) Jacob's a freak!
-Just stop it!

01:01.227 --> 01:04.030
I warned you,
Steve, I've had enough.
Don't push me.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.032
-STEVE: What are you
going to do, freak?
-Right, that's it!

01:06.099 --> 01:07.967
Shut up! Shut up!

01:13.072 --> 01:14.140
(VOICELESS)

01:19.379 --> 01:21.481
What... What's going on?

01:21.548 --> 01:24.617
Steve, stop it.
Stop messing about!

01:24.684 --> 01:26.953
You, too. Just be quiet.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.422
(VOICELESS)

01:29.489 --> 01:32.192
Everyone, stay where you are
and don't move.

01:33.793 --> 01:34.961
Just...

01:36.029 --> 01:37.897
Just be quiet.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.402
(LAUGHING)

01:54.814 --> 01:56.649
Jacob? Jacob!

02:04.724 --> 02:05.892

02:14.968 --> 02:15.902
No!

02:37.657 --> 02:39.425
(KNOCKING) Jacob?

02:40.293 --> 02:41.060
Jacob?

02:47.166 --> 02:49.536
No! Make it stop!

02:49.936 --> 02:50.970
Jacob?

02:51.170 --> 02:52.205
Please...

02:52.272 --> 02:54.040
All of it... Just stop!

02:55.108 --> 02:56.910
(GASPING)

02:58.378 --> 02:59.579
Is everyone okay?

03:11.658 --> 03:13.693
I'm coming in,
so you'd better be decent.

03:17.163 --> 03:18.932
-Jacob?
-Sorry.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.705
What's that?

03:32.745 --> 03:33.780
Hello.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.121
What are you, then?

03:43.489 --> 03:44.891
-(MOBILE RINGING)
-(GASPS)

03:46.960 --> 03:47.894
Oh, hi, Dad.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.030
Meet you in the car park?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.279
CLYDE: It's not a sleepover.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.681
-I don't understand.
-We're not girls.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.117
It's not a sleepover.
You're just
staying the weekend.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.486
And I'll be
sleeping over at yours.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.754
Therefore, it's a sleepover.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.656
I never know whether
you're being serious or not.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.524
-(CHUCKLES) I know.
-(CLYDE LAUGHS)

04:20.059 --> 04:22.195
-Sarah Jane!
-Carla, how are you?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.698
Well, you know,
I'd tell you over a cup of tea
if you ever had the time.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.667
Oh, sorry, I can't. Not today.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.602
I know, I know.
Same old story.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.704
See, Clyde.
Proper job. Keeps her busy.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.640
Has he told you?

04:33.706 --> 04:37.443
He wants to
be the new Banksy.
Graffiti art, he calls it.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.112
CLYDE: Yes, Mum.

04:39.178 --> 04:40.146
Come on, Luke.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.681
Oi!

04:46.185 --> 04:47.420
Thanks again
for taking him in.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.989
Oh, it's not a problem,
he's a sweet boy.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.725
So, Tarminster.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.361
-I'm sorry?
-Clyde says you're
going to Tarminster.

04:55.428 --> 04:58.498
Oh, that's right, yes.
Oh, nothing too exciting.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.633
An article on hospital
hygiene standards.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.036
Don't you get me started
on that MRSA.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.638
Beryl next door,
face like a pineapple.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.774
I'll tell you all about it
when you get back.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.309
Right. Yes,
well, I'd best be off, then.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.612
-I'll pick him up
Sunday night.
-Bye, darling.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.950
What do you wanna do?
Football?
Play on the computer?

05:18.017 --> 05:22.588
Oh, I don't think so.
Friday night,
spag bol night.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.691
Get yourselves
in that kitchen.

05:26.192 --> 05:29.495
-You cook?
-Yeah. It's Mum's new thing.

05:30.129 --> 05:32.565
You? Cook?

05:32.632 --> 05:35.702
-Oh, my baby boy's
a demon in the kitchen.
-Mum!

05:35.768 --> 05:38.905
Aw, Clydey's all embarrassed.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.908
Mum! Mum! Mum, stop it!

05:41.974 --> 05:44.777
(LAUGHS) Right, boys. Food!

05:44.844 --> 05:46.446
RANI: Chinese or pizza?

05:46.512 --> 05:48.214
What's wrong with
my cooking, exactly?

05:48.281 --> 05:50.349
Nothing.
I just fancied a takeaway.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.185
Just don't tell your mum.

05:52.251 --> 05:56.189
She goes away for the weekend
and suddenly you're in charge.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.858
-Chinese?
-You know
I don't like Chinese.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.027
No.
Please, let's have Chinese.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.895
-We'll have Chinese.
-What?

06:02.962 --> 06:05.898
-You said we
should have Chinese.
-Yeah, but you don't like it.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.867
You said we should
have Chinese.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.870
You're doing what I say.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.677
-What's that?
-It's a hamster.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.378
Why do you have a hamster
in your pocket?

06:19.445 --> 06:22.281
-Wow, this is brilliant.
-What's brilliant?

06:22.348 --> 06:25.151
I'm telling you,
this is brilliant.

06:25.218 --> 06:29.021
-It's brilliant.
-Dad! Start hopping.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.823
(LAUGHING) Now the other foot.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.393
Okay, stop it! Stop hopping!

could see yourself.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.182
You want me to die?

06:58.851 --> 06:59.819
No.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.756
No, please, Dad.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.024
I think you should
just forget about
everything that just happened.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.297
Why am I down here?

07:11.364 --> 07:13.166
I think you dropped
some change.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.668
Are you going to
order that pizza, then?

07:23.409 --> 07:24.710
Pass me a menu.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.659

What are you doing here?

07:39.725 --> 07:40.893
Show me your hand.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.896
It's already happening,
isn't it?

07:48.968 --> 07:51.070
Right, you.
Tell me what's going on.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.911
You picked it up at school.
I saw you.

07:59.812 --> 08:00.847
And you've used it.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.118
-It's fading.
-Yeah.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.354
It does that when
you stop using it.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.757
(CHUCKLES) I'm talking
about this like it's normal.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.393
At first,
I was just having fun,
you know?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.829
I just wanted
people to like me.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.165
That's not bad, is it?

08:19.232 --> 08:22.401
Jacob, I need to know
where you found it.

08:22.468 --> 08:25.805
Back of the school yard,
you know, where they're
putting those pipes in.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.541
It was lying there in the mud,

08:28.608 --> 08:31.711
and it looked
really, really nice,
so I picked it up.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.279
And then you
used it on people.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.549
It was an accident, at first.

08:36.616 --> 08:41.354
The more you use it,
it's like it talks to you.

08:41.419 --> 08:45.892
It's like glowing on
the pendant, and then
in your hand, and then...

08:48.527 --> 08:49.829
I think it's evil.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.600
-I know someone
who can get rid of it.
-What are you going to do?

08:57.336 --> 08:58.671
It's gonna be okay.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.912

13:11.924 --> 13:12.892
I blamed Mum.

13:15.294 --> 13:19.231
I figured she must've
done something really
bad to drive you away.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.467
I messed about at school,
got into trouble.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.203
I got expelled.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.838
Yeah, all right,
I'm sorry, mate.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.006
You're sorry?

13:28.307 --> 13:31.944
Dad, one minute
you were there,
and the next...

13:32.011 --> 13:32.912
I had no dad.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.149
Look, I'm putting my hands up.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.187
I've not been the best father
in the world,

13:42.354 --> 13:44.089
but that's why I'm here.

13:46.025 --> 13:49.395
-What do you want?
-Just to spend
some time with you.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.597
I just want us to get
to know each other.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.898
You're still my son.

13:53.532 --> 13:54.867
No.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.669
-What?
-You can't.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.737
He's my kid,
and I won't have you
messing him up.

13:58.804 --> 14:01.473
He's 16, Carla.
He's not a kid.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.975
Dad's right. I'm not a kid.

14:03.042 --> 14:03.909
I didn't mean it
like that, but...

14:07.213 --> 14:10.316
Clyde, if you want to see him,
then I won't stop you.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.084
It's your choice.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.619
I do.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.354
I want to talk to him.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.122
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.962
Cool. How do you
fancy a day out, then?

14:23.162 --> 14:25.064
Will you be all right?
I don't think I'll be long.

14:25.130 --> 14:25.898
Yeah.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.602
I'll get dressed.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.170
Can you wait outside, please?

14:32.304 --> 14:33.906
I don't want you
upsetting Mum.

14:35.107 --> 14:36.709
I'll be here for you.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.611
Afterwards.

14:41.013 --> 14:44.683
Oh, and by the way, Dad,
I'm not 16.

14:45.584 --> 14:46.685
I'm 15.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.473
-Dad?
-Yes, love?

15:07.539 --> 15:10.042
Have you ever had something,
I don't know, bother you?

15:10.976 --> 15:13.512
You could be more specific.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.715
There's this report I'm doing
for the school newspaper,

15:16.782 --> 15:18.951
and I wanted
Sarah Jane's help,
but she's away.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.754
-Mmm?
-So, I was wondering do I wait
for her to come back

15:21.820 --> 15:23.656
or do I try and
work it out myself?

15:23.722 --> 15:25.357
This is you
we're talking about.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.160
Of course, you're gonna try
and work it out yourself.

15:28.227 --> 15:31.163
Yeah, you're right.
See you later.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.765
Where are you going?

15:32.831 --> 15:36.168
Oh, I'd said I'd water
Sarah Jane's plants.
See you.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.905
(MOBILE RINGING)

15:43.976 --> 15:45.344
-Hi, Rani.
-You and Clyde

15:45.411 --> 15:47.413
-meet me at the school now.
-Clyde's gone.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.348
-Gone?
-He's gone out with his dad.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.617
Dad? Okay, we haven't got time
for this now.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.019
I want you in the school field
in 10 minutes, right?

15:54.086 --> 15:54.887
Right.

15:56.922 --> 15:59.558
Remember that park I used to
take you to in Hounslow?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.894
You used to go on the swings.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.830
Make me push you
higher and higher.
(LAUGHS)

16:04.897 --> 16:05.898
Remember?

16:07.032 --> 16:07.900
No.

16:11.270 --> 16:14.306
So, uh, do you fancy an
ice cream or something?

16:14.373 --> 16:17.409
What am I saying?
You're too old for that.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.679
Oh, I don't know.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.981
What do you like?

16:29.922 --> 16:30.889
Why did you leave us?

16:34.493 --> 16:38.464
Sometimes
a bloke and his missus
stop getting on.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.933
Me and your mum...

16:41.867 --> 16:43.469
Well, that's what happened.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.404
I mean, it wasn't your fault.

16:46.538 --> 16:47.873
I never thought it was.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.642
And don't try that.
You ran off with Aunty Mel.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.412
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.684
I didn't do it right.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.819
I messed up. (SIGHS)

17:00.886 --> 17:02.154
Messed up?

17:02.354 --> 17:04.890
You ran off to Germany
with Mum's sister.

17:05.924 --> 17:07.760
You left us.

17:07.826 --> 17:08.894
You left me, Dad.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.464
I never forgot you, though.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.003
You going out?

17:19.070 --> 17:20.873
Yeah. I'm going to
meet up with Rani.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.675
Oh, she's a lovely girl.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.578
You wanna take
some sandwiches? I've got
some ham in the fridge.

17:26.645 --> 17:27.980
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

17:30.482 --> 17:31.784
I'm sure
Clyde's gonna be fine.

17:32.484 --> 17:33.619
You think?

17:35.621 --> 17:37.055
Your dad's not
around either, is he?

17:38.257 --> 17:40.859
No. It's complicated.

17:41.860 --> 17:42.895
It usually is.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.199
Just promise me something.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.334
If he ever turns up, you know,

17:49.401 --> 17:52.571
out of the blue, whatever,
just don't...

17:54.573 --> 17:56.508
Don't forget your mum.

17:57.609 --> 17:58.710
I won't.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.880
Anyway, you go! Go on!

18:01.947 --> 18:04.016
You should never
keep a girl waiting.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.322
So do you speak German?

18:10.389 --> 18:11.423
<i>Ja.</i>

18:11.490 --> 18:12.791
Teach me something.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.662
<i>Ich heisse</i> Paul Langer.

18:16.728 --> 18:21.033
So, <i>ich heisse</i> Clyde Langer.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.468
I am Clyde Langer.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.504
Good to meet you,
Clyde Langer.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.511
So, what about you?

18:33.512 --> 18:35.380
What do you do?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.950
I don't know.
Just hang out with my mates.

18:38.016 --> 18:40.853
Oh what, like, thingy, Luke?

18:42.254 --> 18:43.589
Yeah.

18:43.655 --> 18:44.857
He seems quiet.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.359
Bit of a geek, yeah?

18:47.426 --> 18:49.495
Yeah, but he's cool.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.065
Nah.
I've got a mate in Germany
just like him.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.668
Makes me look good.
(LAUGHS)

18:56.735 --> 18:58.704
That's not why
I hang out with him!

18:58.770 --> 19:01.106
-He's my mate for real.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.574
Sorry.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.546
So, what else do you do?

19:08.847 --> 19:14.152
Well, there is something.

19:14.219 --> 19:18.957
There's this thing I do
that I haven't really
told anyone about, but...

19:19.024 --> 19:21.159
Yeah, I can't
really say what it is.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.162
You a rebel,
like your old man?

19:25.297 --> 19:27.032
What is it?

19:27.099 --> 19:28.901
You drop litter
on the streets?

19:29.868 --> 19:30.903
Come on!

19:32.271 --> 19:34.706
We shouldn't have secrets.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.174
(MOBILE RINGING)

19:39.945 --> 19:40.946
Dad...

19:42.281 --> 19:43.048
Dad...

19:44.783 --> 19:46.552
I save the world.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.488
RANI: I bet Sarah Jane never
does anything like this.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.056
What are you looking for?

19:51.123 --> 19:54.026
Jacob West found
something here.
Something alien.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.627
I wonder how Clyde's doing.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.629
He'll be fine, Luke.

19:59.431 --> 20:01.667
He can look
after himself, you know.
It's Clyde.

20:01.733 --> 20:02.868
Yeah, I guess.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.305
I don't think there's
anything else down here.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.107
(SIGHS) It'd be okay
if Mr Smith was working.

20:09.174 --> 20:10.909
Maybe he'll work for me.
Let's go.

20:13.312 --> 20:17.616
If it wasn't for me,
all these people,
they wouldn't be here.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.952
I've saved them loads of times
and they don't know.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.454
Okay.

20:22.654 --> 20:25.123
Is this some kind of
trading card thing?

20:25.190 --> 20:27.859
-Don't you believe me?
-Nah, nah,
I'm not saying that.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.962
It's just, you and this Luke,

20:30.162 --> 20:33.599
the two of you,
saving the world?

20:33.665 --> 20:37.135
You don't know
what we've seen.
Slitheen. Sontarans.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.971
We've stopped them.
All of them.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.939
You and Luke?

20:41.006 --> 20:42.007
You don't believe me, do you?

20:44.309 --> 20:45.911
Fine! I'll prove it to you.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.279
What?

20:47.346 --> 20:49.348
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Where are we going?

20:49.414 --> 20:51.683
Bannerman Road.
It's where it all happens.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.899
And up here is the attic.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.768
(PANTING)

21:12.137 --> 21:14.906
PAUL:
Whoa, look at all this stuff!

21:17.009 --> 21:18.910
You could make
a fortune on eBay.

21:20.312 --> 21:21.813
What is all this?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.882
Dad, it's not about money.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.018
No, no, course not.

21:26.084 --> 21:27.619
It isn't.

21:27.686 --> 21:28.887
Some of this stuff...

21:29.655 --> 21:31.390
It's alien.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.991
Do you get what that means?

21:33.058 --> 21:34.426
Alien? Yeah, right.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.995
You mean like
those Dalek things?

21:37.062 --> 21:38.864
Yeah, but there're loads more.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.499
Some of them are pretty cool.

21:42.401 --> 21:43.802
All right.

21:43.869 --> 21:47.139
Well, come on then,
show me something alien, hmm?

21:47.205 --> 21:50.275
Come on, sell it to me.

21:50.342 --> 21:54.513
Well, we have this mate
who lives in America.

21:54.579 --> 21:56.682
But Sarah Jane has this.

22:04.322 --> 22:06.792
<i>Hey, hey, Maria!</i>
<i>This friend of Sarah Jane's</i>

22:06.858 --> 22:10.896
<i>given her this</i>
<i>holographic postcard</i>
<i>what's it thing, so...</i>

22:10.962 --> 22:12.898
<i>Hi, Maria. We miss you.</i>

22:14.066 --> 22:16.234
<i>Soft boy.</i>

22:16.301 --> 22:18.837
<i>We don't miss you.</i>
<i>We've moved on.</i>
<i>You're gone and forgotten.</i>

22:18.904 --> 22:20.405
<i>"Maria who?", I say.</i>

22:24.309 --> 22:25.577
See.

22:25.644 --> 22:27.512
Alien tech!

22:27.579 --> 22:28.647
It's true.

22:30.248 --> 22:32.818
I thought it was just
the government and the army.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.620
They dealt with
all that, but you?

22:36.288 --> 22:37.856
(GASPS)

22:37.923 --> 22:41.727
My lad meets aliens?

22:42.728 --> 22:44.062
All in a day's work.

22:45.330 --> 22:46.898
I'm dead proud of you, Clyde.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.602
You've done so much.

22:50.669 --> 22:52.637
Well, I'm just lucky, I guess.

22:52.704 --> 22:56.274
I've got good mates, Mum...

22:56.341 --> 22:59.544
These aliens,
they bring stuff like this?

22:59.611 --> 23:01.713
Yeah, sometimes.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.883
-If we could just
mass produce this...
-Is that all you think about?

23:05.817 --> 23:07.652
Don't you get it?

23:07.719 --> 23:10.188
There's millions
of worlds out there.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.824
It's... It's magic.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.060
Okay, okay!

23:15.127 --> 23:20.165
So it's you,
Luke and this Sarah Jane?

23:21.133 --> 23:23.335
Yeah. Oh,

23:23.401 --> 23:24.903
but behind that wall, there.

23:25.704 --> 23:27.205
That's Mr Smith!

23:27.272 --> 23:30.776
He's basically this big,
alien computer.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.879
You say, "Mr Smith".
And then, you say
something else.

23:33.945 --> 23:37.149
But I won't say that
cos we're not meant
to be up here,

23:37.215 --> 23:38.750
and he'll tell Sarah Jane.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.152
But yeah,
you say that, and it's all...

23:42.420 --> 23:44.122
And out he comes. Pretty cool.

23:47.526 --> 23:48.894
Dad? What are you doing?

23:50.629 --> 23:52.063
Just looking.

23:52.130 --> 23:54.466
So, yeah, aliens.

23:54.533 --> 23:55.901
(LAUGHS)

23:55.967 --> 23:58.804
Aliens come to
Ealing and meet you.

23:58.870 --> 24:01.106
Yep. Who's the daddy now?

24:01.606 --> 24:02.774
(LAUGHS)

24:06.011 --> 24:06.912
Clyde Langer!

24:07.779 --> 24:09.981
What are you doing here?

24:10.048 --> 24:11.883
Sarah Jane's away
for the weekend.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.887
-And who are you?
-Paul Langer.

24:16.087 --> 24:16.922
Clyde's dad.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.893
Oh.
Well, it's nice to meet you.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.995
This is Mr Chandra.
He's my head teacher.

24:24.062 --> 24:25.764
Oh, all right, mate.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.732
Clyde hasn't stopped
raving about you
and your school.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.267
He loves it there. (CHUCKLES)

24:29.334 --> 24:31.303
-Does he?
-I'm joking.

24:31.369 --> 24:33.438
(BOTH LAUGHING)

24:33.505 --> 24:34.906
Can I ask what
you're both doing here?

24:35.774 --> 24:38.376
Uh, watering the plants.

24:38.443 --> 24:41.313
Yeah, Sarah Jane asked me
to water the plants
when she's away.

24:41.379 --> 24:44.716
That's interesting. Because
apparently, she asked Rani
to do that as well.

24:44.783 --> 24:47.419
Uh, there's lots of plants.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.654
I'm sure you think
you're being funny, Clyde,
but it's serious.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.823
Oh, come on, mate,
it's not that serious.
Just drop it, eh?

24:56.328 --> 24:58.230
-You okay?
-I'm okay.

24:58.296 --> 25:00.065
Okay.

25:00.131 --> 25:02.968
You want to watch it
with the pizza, though.
Cholesterol city.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.870
-I beg your pardon?
-I'm just saying.

25:04.936 --> 25:07.239
Not exactly setting
a good example for the kids.

25:07.305 --> 25:10.075
Thank you,
I do plenty of
exercise, actually.

25:10.141 --> 25:12.544
With all that pizza,
too right, you should
exercise, mate.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.679
I should exercise.

25:16.882 --> 25:19.150
(LAUGHING) Mr Chandra?

25:19.951 --> 25:21.152
Is he...

25:21.219 --> 25:22.988
He is!

25:23.054 --> 25:24.789
-(CLYDE CHUCKLING)
-He's doing what I tell him.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.793
Oi, mate, jogging's for wimps.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.095
(DISTORTED)
Get doing some push-ups, yeah?

25:33.832 --> 25:34.966
(BOTH LAUGHING)

25:36.334 --> 25:37.402
Dad?

25:39.104 --> 25:41.273
-What are you doing?
-Jogging's for wimps.

25:41.339 --> 25:42.474
I'm doing press-ups.

25:42.540 --> 25:43.608
(LAUGHING)

25:44.709 --> 25:45.877
What's happened?

25:45.944 --> 25:46.912
(LAUGHING)

25:49.447 --> 25:50.749
Who are you?

25:50.815 --> 25:53.685
Oh, Rani, this is my dad.

25:53.752 --> 25:54.886
Have you been
up to the attic?

25:55.987 --> 25:57.522
Yeah. So?

25:57.589 --> 25:59.658
Mum doesn't like
anyone going in there.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.494
And you always do
what you're told,
do you?

26:02.560 --> 26:04.796
Clyde reckons
you lot save the world.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.831
You told him what we do?

26:06.898 --> 26:09.668
Mr Langer,
have you taken something
that doesn't belong to you?

26:09.734 --> 26:10.969
Hey, that's my dad
you're talking to!

26:11.169 --> 26:12.637
He's nicked something alien!

26:12.704 --> 26:13.939
There was
this pendant at school.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.707
Jacob West was using it
to brainwash people.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.643
Don't you go round
accusing my dad
of nicking stuff!

26:18.710 --> 26:20.278
Who do you think you are?

26:20.345 --> 26:21.846
You take your dad
up to the attic,
he comes back down

26:21.913 --> 26:24.316
and suddenly
my dad's doing what
your dad tells him to!

26:24.382 --> 26:27.052
Clyde, mate,
I really can't be bothered
with all this.

26:30.655 --> 26:33.358
Rani, perhaps we should
go inside and speak
to Mr Smith.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.592
You're calling my dad a thief!

26:34.659 --> 26:35.961
What is your problem?

26:36.027 --> 26:38.363
He's stolen it. Can't you see?
It's dangerous!

26:38.430 --> 26:40.865
What do you mean
it's dangerous?
What are you talking about?

26:40.932 --> 26:42.600
Clyde.

26:42.667 --> 26:43.902
Yeah, I'm coming, Dad.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.137
PAUL: Good.

26:46.204 --> 26:48.039
Oh, and Clyde...

26:48.106 --> 26:49.674
Forget about those two.

26:49.741 --> 26:52.777
You see, he's got it.

26:52.844 --> 26:55.480
(DISTORTED)
I want you to forget
about them completely.

26:58.950 --> 26:59.884
Clyde?

27:01.086 --> 27:02.587
I'm... I'm fine.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.891
Clyde! Clyde, wait!

27:06.958 --> 27:07.959
Sorry, do I know you?

27:09.094 --> 27:10.195
What? Clyde?

27:10.261 --> 27:11.496
How do you know my name?

27:11.563 --> 27:13.365
It's me! Luke!

27:13.431 --> 27:16.167
Nah, sorry, mate,
never seen you before
in my life.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.803
Come on, Dad.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.171
-Clyde!
-Forget it!

27:21.706 --> 27:22.841
Clyde's gone.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.383
I'm your best friend.

27:31.449 --> 27:32.617
You're a freak!

27:32.684 --> 27:34.152
(TYRES SCREECHING)

27:34.219 --> 27:36.621
He wants to take him away!
He wants to take my baby.

27:36.688 --> 27:38.189
(STRAINING)

27:38.256 --> 27:40.425
She's gonna see the pendant.
She's gonna see everything.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.593
What are you doing?

27:41.659 --> 27:43.461
Get off me, you. Who are you?

27:43.528 --> 27:47.799
This whole world
will do as I say!
