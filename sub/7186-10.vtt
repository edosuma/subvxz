Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.230 --> 01:05.931
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.333 --> 01:08.333
Great!

01:08.335 --> 01:09.902
To start today's adventure,

01:09.904 --> 01:12.604
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:12.606 --> 01:14.173
Yo-ho ho!

- [all] Yo-ho ho!

Yo-ho ho!

01:23.683 --> 01:26.251
<i>[Jake]</i>
<i>Big Bug Valley.</i>

01:26.253 --> 01:29.988
I thought I ordered you
to swab the deck.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.157
What are you doing?

01:32.159 --> 01:35.160
Oh, I was just reading from
my favorite book about bugs

01:35.162 --> 01:36.795
to me matey, Harry.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.031
Harry? Harry who?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.166
Well, Harry Spider,
of course.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.301
[squeaking]

01:42.303 --> 01:47.739
[screaming]

01:47.741 --> 01:51.343
Ooh, the Cap'n's
doing a bug dance.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.345
Bones, put Harry away.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.181
You know the Cap'n
is afraid of bugs.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.282
[squeaking]

01:57.284 --> 01:59.351
Back home you go, Harry.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.153
- Ooh!
- Oopsy!

02:01.155 --> 02:02.754
What's this?

02:02.756 --> 02:06.258
That bug looks like
it's made of gold.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.928
Oh, that's
the Golden Caterpillar.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.131
He's magnificent,
all right.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.133
He lives in
Big Bug Valley.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.869
And there's a legend
about that caterpillar.

02:16.871 --> 02:20.405
If you follow it,
it will lead you to...

02:20.407 --> 02:21.940
...treasure!

02:21.942 --> 02:24.143
[gasps]
Did you say...

02:24.145 --> 02:26.245
...treasure?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.379
Smee!

02:27.381 --> 02:30.182
Set sail for
Big Bug Valley!

02:30.184 --> 02:32.084
We're off
to find that bug.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.385
[Bones] Oh, goody!

02:33.387 --> 02:35.320
[Hook] And treasure.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.656
[Smee] Oh, dear!

02:39.259 --> 02:42.361
[chuckles]
Step lively, mateys.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.930
Big Bug Valley
is just ahead.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.732
Ahoy! Bones.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.066
Mr. Smee.

02:48.068 --> 02:51.170
Oh, look, Cap'n,
we have company.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.271
Blast!

02:52.273 --> 02:55.707
We're looking for bugs,
not pests!

02:55.709 --> 02:57.376
We're off
to Big Bug Valley

02:57.378 --> 02:59.878
to find
the Golden Caterpillar.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.247
Legend says
that if you follow...

03:02.249 --> 03:03.715
Enough, Bones!

03:03.717 --> 03:07.719
Not everyone shares
your passion for bugs.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.389
Finding the Golden Caterpillar
sounds like fun.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.024
Can we come along?

03:12.026 --> 03:14.293
You? With me?

03:14.295 --> 03:17.396
- Why, I'd sooner...
- Uh, Cap'n.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.464
The sea pups are clever.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.367
Why, they could help us
find the caterpillar.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.369
And the treasure!

03:24.371 --> 03:27.739
Puny pirates,
do come along.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.142
And, uh...

03:30.144 --> 03:31.276
Please.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.978
Sure thing, Captain Hook.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.379
We'd be happy to go.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.914
Step lively, men.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.217
We're off to
Big Bug Valley.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.818
Uh, Jake?

03:39.820 --> 03:44.389
Big Bug Valley is full
of all kinds of big bugs!

03:44.391 --> 03:47.292
They might be big
and look scary, Cubby,

03:47.294 --> 03:49.228
but they're really nice.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.295
Well...

03:50.297 --> 03:51.296
OK!

03:51.298 --> 03:53.065
Say, mateys.

03:53.067 --> 03:56.235
Do you want to go find the
Golden Caterpillar with us?

03:57.503 --> 03:59.204
Great!

03:59.206 --> 04:01.506
Remember to keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.909
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

04:03.911 --> 04:06.144
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em,

04:06.146 --> 04:08.313
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.415
Is everybody ready?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.984
I got my sword.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.385
I got my map.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.787
And I've got
my pixie dust.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.122
The fairies
gave it to me

04:17.124 --> 04:19.124
so that we can
use it to fly.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.059
But only in emergencies.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.361
Yo-ho!

04:22.363 --> 04:25.163
Let's go to
Big Bug Valley.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.136
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

04:31.138 --> 04:33.338
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

04:33.340 --> 04:34.906
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

04:34.908 --> 04:38.377
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:38.379 --> 04:41.213
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:41.215 --> 04:43.315
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:45.051 --> 04:46.351
Ahoy!

04:46.353 --> 04:49.421
At last!
Big Bug Valley.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.191
[Cubby] Coconuts!

04:53.193 --> 04:54.793
What are those?

04:54.795 --> 04:57.229
Thems roly-poly bugs.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.364
They're as harmless
as baby lambs.

04:59.366 --> 05:02.367
As long as no one
bothers them.

05:02.369 --> 05:06.471
Well, then,
I've seen enough bugs.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.874
Shoo, you! Shoo!

05:08.876 --> 05:10.242
Uh-oh, Cap'n!

05:10.244 --> 05:12.044
You shouldn't
oughta done that.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.479
[shouts] Smee!

05:15.448 --> 05:17.516
[Izzy]
Shiver me timbers!

05:17.518 --> 05:19.418
If we want to find
the Golden Caterpillar,

05:19.420 --> 05:22.521
we'll have to get past
those roly-poly bugs.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.323
I've got an idea.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.059
Line up and run with me.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.328
Captain Hook
follows no one.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.164
Especially
a pee-wee pirate.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.132
Run!

05:34.134 --> 05:35.100
Run!

05:35.102 --> 05:36.468
Run!

05:36.470 --> 05:38.437
Whoo-hoo!
We made it.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.372
Yo-ho, way to go!

05:40.374 --> 05:43.008
We got past
the roly-poly bugs,

05:43.010 --> 05:45.444
and got two
gold doubloons.

05:45.446 --> 05:49.381
Let's grab 'em and go look
for the Golden Caterpillar.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.450
Well, if a puny pirate

05:51.452 --> 05:54.152
can get past
these big, blasted bugs,

05:54.154 --> 05:56.588
so can I.

05:56.590 --> 06:00.625
I hate bugs.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.196
Hmm. Looks like
we've walked

06:04.198 --> 06:06.998
all the way to the middle
of Big Bug Valley.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.335
And that means
we're surrounded
by even more bugs.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.536
[whirring]

06:11.538 --> 06:13.372
Bigger ones!

06:15.441 --> 06:16.508
Hey!

06:16.510 --> 06:18.944
Come back here!

06:18.946 --> 06:20.412
Stop!

06:20.414 --> 06:22.314
[grunts] Gotcha!

06:22.316 --> 06:24.983
Whew!
Now where am I?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.918
[trilling]

06:26.920 --> 06:30.622
Coconuts!
The Golden Caterpillar!

06:32.325 --> 06:34.259
Hope he didn't see me.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.360
-[trilling]
-[screams]

06:35.362 --> 06:37.429
Please don't eat me!

06:37.431 --> 06:39.564
[trilling]

06:39.566 --> 06:42.434
You don't seem so scary.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.970
You actually sound
kind of friendly.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.243
Awesome! We found
the Golden Caterpillar.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.612
And we got two more
gold doubloons.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.946
Let's grab 'em,

06:54.948 --> 06:57.482
and go show this big bug
to our mateys.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.653
Cubby!

07:01.655 --> 07:03.455
Cubby!

07:03.457 --> 07:04.923
Ahoy!

07:04.925 --> 07:07.192
- Cubby!
- Little matey!

07:07.194 --> 07:08.427
Yoo-hoo!

07:08.429 --> 07:09.628
Where'd he go?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.596
[Cubby]
Ahoy, mateys!

07:11.598 --> 07:12.964
Here I am!

07:12.966 --> 07:14.366
[Bones] Oh, lovely!

07:14.368 --> 07:16.401
- Oh, my!
- Wow!

07:16.403 --> 07:18.370
Treasure!

07:18.372 --> 07:20.138
Whoa!

07:20.140 --> 07:21.339
I was lost,

07:21.341 --> 07:23.408
until this big fella
found me.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.478
Go ahead. Pet him.
He likes it.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.513
[trilling]

07:28.515 --> 07:32.050
Oh! Swash me buckle!

07:32.052 --> 07:36.054
I dreamed someday I'd meet
a golden caterpillar.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.356
Now,
according to the legend,

07:38.358 --> 07:42.294
if we follow him,
he'll lead us right to...

07:42.296 --> 07:44.362
What Mr. Bones
is trying to say

07:44.364 --> 07:47.032
is if we follow
this beast,

07:47.034 --> 07:51.436
we might learn all kinds
of fascinating things.

07:51.438 --> 07:55.140
Mr. Caterpillar, would it
be OK if we followed you?

07:58.344 --> 08:01.179
Yo-ho, let's go!

08:02.215 --> 08:06.051
And keep both eyes
peeled for treasure.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.522
We're near
the treasure, Smee.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.390
I can feel it!

08:12.392 --> 08:14.659
[trilling]

08:19.499 --> 08:21.766
The treasure
must be in the tree.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.504
[Hook]
What in wonder?

08:25.506 --> 08:28.740
Look, he's winding
himself up in a cocoon.

08:28.742 --> 08:32.010
Actually, it's called
a chrysalis.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.346
When the caterpillar
is fully grown,

08:34.348 --> 08:36.014
it makes a bunch of silk,

08:36.016 --> 08:40.018
which it uses to attach itself
to a leaf or twig.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.655
Ah. Isn't nature grand?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.625
Indeed, it is not!

08:46.627 --> 08:48.326
Come out of there.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.562
You're supposed to
lead me to a treasure.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.164
Treasure?
What treasure?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.066
Oh, there's a legend
that says

08:55.068 --> 08:57.335
if you follow
the Golden Caterpillar,

08:57.337 --> 08:59.704
it will lead you
to treasure.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.440
So, that's why
you're here, Hook.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.476
You don't really
care about bugs.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.245
I do if they can
make me rich.

09:07.247 --> 09:11.516
There's treasure in there,
I just know it.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.618
He might be
sleeping, Cap'n.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.487
He'll come out
soon enough.

09:15.489 --> 09:18.623
I want the treasure now!

09:19.592 --> 09:21.526
[grunting]

09:21.528 --> 09:22.761
Blast!

09:22.763 --> 09:24.462
- Whoa!
- Izzy.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.364
We've gotta help
the caterpillar.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.333
This is an emergency.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.168
Then it's pixie dust away!

09:30.170 --> 09:34.339
[shouts]

09:34.341 --> 09:37.108
Way-hey!
We saved the chrysalis,

09:37.110 --> 09:39.578
and got five more
gold doubloons.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.479
Let's grab 'em and go.

09:45.117 --> 09:46.785
[Sharky]
Galloping galleons!

09:46.787 --> 09:49.588
That caterpillar
turned into a butterfly.

09:49.590 --> 09:55.560
Turning into a butterfly is
the treasure of the caterpillar.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.462
Blast!

09:57.464 --> 09:59.364
I want real treasure!

09:59.366 --> 10:01.499
Not flying bugs!

10:01.501 --> 10:02.701
But look, Cap'n.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.370
It's wings
sparkle like gold.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.838
Gold, you say?

10:06.840 --> 10:11.776
That's it!
That is the treasure I want.

10:11.778 --> 10:16.381
Smee, after that
golden butterfly.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.451
Get back here,
you big bug!

10:21.387 --> 10:24.122
[trilling]

10:24.124 --> 10:25.223
Come on!

10:25.225 --> 10:27.459
He wants us
to take a ride.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.429
[all exclaiming]

10:31.431 --> 10:35.900
Oh. Yet another treasure
flits away.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.203
[Jake]
See ya later, Hook.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.672
[Izzy] Have fun
with the big bugs.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.709
Thanks for the lift,
big bug pal.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.778
[trilling]

10:46.780 --> 10:50.148
Thanks for helping us find
the Golden Caterpillar, mateys.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.350
Now, let's put all
our gold doubloons

10:52.352 --> 10:54.519
into our Team Treasure Chest.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.895
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:03.897 --> 11:05.864
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:05.866 --> 11:07.866
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:07.868 --> 11:10.835
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:10.837 --> 11:13.271
Come on.
Count with us.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.640
[all] Yeah!

11:16.809 --> 11:20.545
[Jake]
One, two, three, four.

11:20.547 --> 11:24.783
[Izzy] Five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.251
[Jake] Yo-ho!

11:26.253 --> 11:28.486
For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:28.488 --> 11:31.656
we got nine gold doubloons.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.659
And I made a new
butterfly friend.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.528
Shiver me timbers, Cubby.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.263
What's that on your arm?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.464
[screams]

11:39.466 --> 11:41.499
[laughs] Fooled ya.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.401
It's just a toy spider.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.937
- Cubby!
- [all laugh]

11:48.374 --> 11:50.508
[Hook] Well, Smee,
once again

11:50.510 --> 11:52.477
I have returned
from a treasure hunt

11:52.479 --> 11:55.647
with nothing
but a broken heart.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.449
Cheer up, sir.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.818
I've got something
to chase away the blues.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.053
- Harry!
- [screams]

12:02.055 --> 12:04.322
[grunting]

12:04.324 --> 12:08.593
Hey, looky! The Cap'n's
doing his bug dance again.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.528
[Smee] Go, Cap'n, go!

12:16.001 --> 12:18.803
<i>[Jake] The Queen</i>
<i>of Never Land.</i>

12:18.805 --> 12:22.006
One, two, three,

12:22.008 --> 12:25.810
four, five, six, seven,

12:25.812 --> 12:29.280
eight, nine, ten!

12:29.282 --> 12:31.282
Ahoy! I'm a'comin'.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.717
[chuckles]

12:33.786 --> 12:34.819
[giggles]

12:35.855 --> 12:37.522
A-ha!

12:38.557 --> 12:40.391
I found...

12:40.393 --> 12:42.660
You're not the boys.

12:42.662 --> 12:43.928
You're the girls.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.631
It's a Pirate Princess
and Princess Winger.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.800
Hey, there,
pirate friends.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.535
What brings you
to Pirate Island?

12:50.537 --> 12:53.404
We wanted to share
the big news.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.006
Winger and I have been
invited to meet

12:55.008 --> 12:57.008
with the Queen
of Never Land.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.510
Huh?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.945
I didn't know there was
a Queen of Never Land.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.447
Neither did we.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.550
No one has ever heard
of the Queen until now.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.718
See?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.987
"I'm the Queen of Never Land,
you know.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.756
But the time has come
for me to go.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.826
Because you're a princess,
I might give you my crown.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.829
Then you could be
the new queen in town."

13:17.831 --> 13:20.298
But you're both princesses.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.801
Which one of you will she
pick to be the next queen?

13:22.803 --> 13:25.737
Well, she says here
we must each bring her

13:25.739 --> 13:28.006
a special gift
to help her decide.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.041
Why don't you all
come with us,

13:30.043 --> 13:32.710
as we present our gifts
to the queen?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.746
Mateys, want to go with us

13:34.748 --> 13:37.048
to meet the Queen
of Never Land?

13:38.552 --> 13:42.387
Remember to keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.689
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

13:44.691 --> 13:46.925
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em,

13:46.927 --> 13:49.427
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

13:49.429 --> 13:53.865
Yo-ho, let's go meet
the Queen of Never Land.

13:56.936 --> 14:00.104
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

14:00.106 --> 14:02.941
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:02.943 --> 14:07.445
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:07.447 --> 14:10.114
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:10.116 --> 14:12.617
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:14.720 --> 14:16.955
All hail to me!

14:16.957 --> 14:19.624
The Queen of Never Land.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.959
[chuckles]

14:20.961 --> 14:22.894
With this disguise, Smee,

14:22.896 --> 14:25.630
I don't have to
hunt for treasure,

14:25.632 --> 14:29.534
because those silly princesses
will bring the treasure to me.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.070
So, that's why you
told the princesses

14:32.072 --> 14:35.974
to bring royal gifts
of treasure to
the Queen of Never Land.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.775
Exactly.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.444
[girl] Oh, yoo-hoo!

14:39.446 --> 14:41.579
[gasps] They're here!

14:43.682 --> 14:46.684
Princess Winger
and the Pirate Princess

14:46.686 --> 14:49.854
to see the Queen
of Never Land.

14:49.856 --> 14:52.857
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Your Highness.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.693
Thanks.
[coughing]

14:55.695 --> 14:59.397
[high voice] I mean,
thank you for coming,
my dears.

14:59.399 --> 15:04.636
Oh. And I see you
brought a few friends.

15:04.638 --> 15:06.404
How delightful.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.740
There's something funny
about this queen.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.174
She looks familiar.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.476
[clearing throat]

15:11.478 --> 15:13.811
It is now time
for me to decide

15:13.813 --> 15:19.550
which princess will be
the next Queen of Never Land.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.786
Who wishes to give me
their treasure?

15:21.788 --> 15:26.524
I mean,
their royal gift first?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.526
Allow me,
Your Highness.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.129
Today, I will give you
the greatest gift

15:31.131 --> 15:32.897
I have to offer.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.933
Yes? Yes?!

15:34.935 --> 15:36.034
A song.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.835
A song?

15:39.438 --> 15:42.707
<i>¶ The greatest gift</i>
<i>I can give to you ¶</i>

15:42.709 --> 15:47.912
<i>¶ Is a special song</i>
<i>to your own tune ¶</i>

15:47.914 --> 15:50.014
<i>¶ A gift for you </i>

15:50.016 --> 15:52.016
<i>¶ That can't be seen </i>

15:52.018 --> 15:55.720
¶ My present to you
is a melody ¶

15:55.722 --> 15:58.623
<i>¶ I'll sing you a song </i>

15:58.625 --> 16:01.993
<i>¶ That's just for you </i>

16:01.995 --> 16:04.696
<i>¶ A song for you </i>

16:07.533 --> 16:09.901
Oh, ahoy.

16:09.903 --> 16:13.204
It was not quite
what I was expecting.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.706
Next!

16:14.708 --> 16:18.076
[gasps] Your purse
of diamonds.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.812
Now that's a true treasure.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.246
[giggles]

16:22.248 --> 16:23.982
No, Your Majesty.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.885
I'm giving you something far
more precious than diamonds.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.122
I'm giving you the gift
of a rainbow light show.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.025
A rainbow what? No!

16:38.998 --> 16:40.098
Wow!

16:40.100 --> 16:41.799
Shiver me timbers!

16:41.801 --> 16:43.534
Sparkly!

16:43.536 --> 16:46.938
What a wonderful gift!

16:46.940 --> 16:48.940
Blast and bilgewater!

16:48.942 --> 16:51.943
I don't want silly
rainbow lights!

16:51.945 --> 16:54.879
Oh! I'm sorry,
Your Majesty.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.681
I didn't mean
to upset you.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.150
I'm thinking that
maybe this queen

16:59.152 --> 17:01.152
isn't really a queen.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.920
We need proof.

17:02.922 --> 17:03.988
I have an idea.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.290
Queens are really good
at bowing.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.960
So, let's see if
this "Queen" of Never Land

17:08.962 --> 17:10.661
bows like one.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.097
Or if she bows
like a sneaky snook.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.832
Sorry, Your Highness.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.068
But we all forgot
to bow to you.

17:17.070 --> 17:20.905
Oh, yes.
How terribly rude of you.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.808
We must always bow
to our...

17:23.810 --> 17:24.876
...queen.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.546
Crooked crackers!

17:28.548 --> 17:31.082
That's no queen.
That's Captain Hook!

17:31.084 --> 17:32.316
Blast.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.886
[chuckles]
All right!

17:34.888 --> 17:36.988
We found out
that the queen

17:36.990 --> 17:40.291
isn't really a queen.
It's Captain Hook.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.760
And we got
three gold doubloons.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.862
Let's grab 'em,
and go keep him

17:44.864 --> 17:47.565
from causing
any more trouble.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.835
You puny pirates
may have ruined me plan.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.871
But I'm still
getting me treasure.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.740
Come on, Smee!

17:55.742 --> 17:58.042
Sorry about this, kids.
[shouts]

17:58.044 --> 17:59.944
Stormy seas!

17:59.946 --> 18:03.214
I can't believe we fell
for sneaky Hook's trick.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.016
Don't worry,
Pirate Princess.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.818
We'll help you get
your diamonds back.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.686
Come on!

18:09.955 --> 18:12.290
[Hook] Me plan
worked like a charm.

18:12.292 --> 18:16.794
Look at all this dazzling
diamond-y treasure.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.062
[sobbing]

18:18.064 --> 18:19.831
What is it, Smee?

18:19.833 --> 18:23.301
Well, Cap'n, you took
the Pirate Princess' diamonds

18:23.303 --> 18:25.169
without even
a thank you.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.771
Fine.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.975
The next time I see her
I'll be sure to say thanks.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.678
Oh! Well, you're
in luck, Cap'n.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.847
Oh, here she comes now.

18:35.849 --> 18:36.848
What?!

18:36.850 --> 18:38.950
Ahoy, Captain Hook.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.819
You have something
that belongs to our friend.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.989
Blast! It's Jake
and his puny pirates.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.290
Quickly, men.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.826
Bring the ship
into that viney swamp.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.963
Once we sail into
that jungle of hanging vines,

18:51.965 --> 18:55.066
those itty-bitty buccaneers
will never find us.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.735
Bucky. Into the vines!

19:03.242 --> 19:05.877
Whoa! What was that?

19:05.879 --> 19:09.080
Shiver me timbers!
We're stuck!

19:09.082 --> 19:11.649
We need to get untangled.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.252
Maybe we can all swing
the vines off the rigging.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.086
Come on!

19:15.088 --> 19:17.255
Yeah!

19:17.257 --> 19:19.891
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whee!

19:19.893 --> 19:21.926
All right!

19:21.928 --> 19:23.794
Whoa!

19:23.796 --> 19:25.296
Sunny skies.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.697
[bell rings]

19:26.699 --> 19:29.200
Yay-hey!
We untangled Bucky.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.836
And we got four more
gold doubloons.

19:31.838 --> 19:35.406
Let's grab 'em,
and go stop Captain Hook.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.041
[Hook] Barnacles!

19:37.043 --> 19:38.876
Why aren't we moving?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.378
I don't think we can.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.147
We're stuck in
these vines, Cap'n.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.882
Bilgewater!

19:44.884 --> 19:46.918
I'm the captain
of this ship,

19:46.920 --> 19:50.354
and I say full speed
ahead, Mr. Smee.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.723
But Cap'n,
the tangling vines

19:52.725 --> 19:54.759
might rip the sails
on our ship!

19:54.761 --> 19:56.627
I said full speed ahead!

20:00.032 --> 20:01.999
Blast, blast, blast!

20:02.001 --> 20:05.736
Without the sails,
I can't control the ship.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.872
This is all
your fault, Smee.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.841
Cap'n, I was just doing
what you told me to do!

20:10.843 --> 20:13.444
Then stop doing
what I tell you to do.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.214
[shouting]

20:16.216 --> 20:20.351
Me purse!
Me treasure!

20:20.353 --> 20:21.719
My diamonds!

20:21.721 --> 20:23.054
Whew!

20:26.925 --> 20:29.327
[chortling]

20:29.329 --> 20:30.795
[gasping]

20:30.797 --> 20:32.930
Not the Tick Tock Croc!

20:32.932 --> 20:34.765
Save me, Smee!

20:34.767 --> 20:37.034
This is an emergency.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.336
And that means...

20:38.338 --> 20:42.039
...pixie dust away!

20:42.041 --> 20:45.176
[gasps] Dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear!

20:45.178 --> 20:47.278
Gotcha!

20:47.280 --> 20:49.113
All right!

20:49.115 --> 20:50.848
We saved Captain Hook,

20:50.850 --> 20:53.150
and we got four more
gold doubloons.

20:53.152 --> 20:57.188
Let's grab 'em, and go
bring Hook back to his crew.

20:57.190 --> 21:02.560
I suppose this calls for
a thank you for rescuing me.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.029
But Captain Hook
never says...

21:05.031 --> 21:08.966
Thank you for helping
me dear Cap'n.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.001
[all] You're welcome.

21:10.003 --> 21:15.006
Oh, barnacles!

21:15.008 --> 21:16.507
<i>[Pirate Princess]</i>
<i>Thank you, pirate friends.</i>

21:16.509 --> 21:19.076
For all your help,
I'm giving each of you

21:19.078 --> 21:21.912
a sparkling diamond
from my purse.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.881
Thanks!

21:23.883 --> 21:26.317
Ooh, sparkly!

21:26.319 --> 21:28.519
- [Jake] Goodbye!
- [Cubby] Bye-bye, Princess.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.988
- [Izzy] See you soon!
- [Skully] Bye, Winger.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.857
Thanks for helping
the Pirate Princess

21:32.859 --> 21:34.892
and Princess Winger today.

21:34.894 --> 21:38.029
Now, let's put all our
gold doubloons and diamonds,

21:38.031 --> 21:40.197
into our Team Treasure Chest.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.874
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:49.876 --> 21:51.842
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:51.844 --> 21:53.844
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

21:53.846 --> 21:56.881
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

21:56.883 --> 21:58.983
Come on.
Count with us.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.252
[all] Yeah!

22:02.554 --> 22:06.057
[Jake] One, two,
three, four.

22:06.059 --> 22:09.026
[Cubby] Five, six,
seven, eight.

22:09.028 --> 22:12.063
[Izzy] Nine, ten, eleven.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.197
[Jake] Yo-ho!

22:13.199 --> 22:15.433
For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:15.435 --> 22:18.402
we got eleven
gold doubloons.

22:18.404 --> 22:24.975
And one, two, three,
four diamonds!

22:24.977 --> 22:26.410
[Skully] Ahoy!

22:26.412 --> 22:27.845
Skully?

22:27.847 --> 22:31.182
All bow to the King
of Never Land.

22:31.184 --> 22:34.185
By royal decree,
all me mateys

22:34.187 --> 22:37.021
must bring me a gift.
Of crackers.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.423
[all laughing]

22:41.259 --> 22:44.128
<i>[Hook] I can't</i>
<i>believe it, boys.</i>

22:44.130 --> 22:46.964
<i>All that trouble</i>
<i>and I didn't even get</i>

22:46.966 --> 22:50.101
one measly diamond.

22:50.103 --> 22:53.037
Ah, 'twasn't
a total loss, Cap'n.

22:53.039 --> 22:57.007
That dress of yours
makes for a mighty fine sail.

22:58.877 --> 23:02.380
Long live the Queen!

23:02.382 --> 23:05.082
I mean, King!

23:06.451 --> 23:09.286
<i>¶ Well, I'm on the deck</i>
<i>and swinging</i>

23:09.288 --> 23:11.122
<i>¶ In my hammock</i>
<i>side to side ¶</i>

23:11.124 --> 23:14.058
<i>¶ Those rockin' waves</i>
<i>just rock my cares away ¶</i>

23:15.494 --> 23:17.561
<i>¶ Let blow the wind</i>
<i>and weather ¶</i>

23:17.563 --> 23:19.597
<i>¶ It makes a better ride </i>

23:19.599 --> 23:23.601
<i>¶ And when I'm swingin'</i>
<i>I could swing all day ¶</i>

23:23.603 --> 23:25.436
<i>¶ It's a jolly afternoon </i>

23:25.438 --> 23:27.371
<i>¶ Nothing else</i>
<i>I want to do ¶</i>

23:27.373 --> 23:29.240
<i>¶ Hit the hammock,</i>
<i>swing along ¶</i>

23:29.242 --> 23:30.975
<i>¶ And sing my hammock</i>
<i>swingin' song ¶</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:37.181
<i>¶ Now hoist that riggin',</i>
<i>set the sails ¶</i>

23:38.984 --> 23:41.152
<i>¶ Stretch them hammocks</i>
<i>to the rails ¶</i>

23:43.054 --> 23:45.022
<i>¶ What a perfect</i>
<i>pirate day ¶</i>

23:45.024 --> 23:46.957
<i>¶ Now the ship is underway </i>

23:46.959 --> 23:48.692
<i>¶ Tropic breeze</i>
<i>and sunny shine ¶</i>

23:48.694 --> 23:51.529
<i>¶ Swayin' in this net</i>
<i>of mine ¶</i>

23:51.531 --> 23:55.199
<i>¶ Now I'm swinging</i>
<i>in my hammock ¶</i>

23:55.201 --> 23:57.034
<i>¶ Swingin' in my hammock </i>

23:57.036 --> 23:59.003
<i>¶ I'm swingin'</i>
<i>in my hammock ¶</i>

23:59.005 --> 24:00.171
<i>¶ Swingin' in my hammock </i>

24:00.173 --> 24:02.773
<i>¶ I'm swingin'</i>
<i>in my hammock ¶</i>

24:02.775 --> 24:04.975
<i>¶ On a sunny afternoon </i>
