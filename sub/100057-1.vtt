WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:06.305
You have terrible taste, Jean.

00:07.297 --> 00:08.531
Had.

00:09.195 --> 00:11.989
You married a huge jerk
who didn't deserve you,

00:11.991 --> 00:13.351
and then you died.

00:13.376 --> 00:15.945
Another... poor choice,

00:15.970 --> 00:19.632
leaving me alone in Kentucky.

00:22.142 --> 00:24.718
If there is a reason for
me to keep on living,

00:25.689 --> 00:28.718
y-you have to... send me a sign.

00:28.743 --> 00:31.037

- Oh, jeez.

00:31.062 --> 00:34.427

to each note,

00:55.944 --> 00:58.911
which ruins the listening experience.

00:59.317 --> 01:02.406
Diet Vin Diesel, stand up straight

01:02.408 --> 01:03.950
so we can hear you.

01:04.489 --> 01:07.488
Porno Mister Rogers,
do you have a bug in your ear?

01:07.513 --> 01:09.231
- No.
- Then don't do that.

01:09.256 --> 01:11.389
Whitney Houston, we have a problem.

01:11.414 --> 01:13.677
Your confidence exceeds your talents.

01:13.702 --> 01:17.170
Snake Tattoo, George Frideric Handel

01:17.195 --> 01:20.661
didn't know anyone named Hal.

01:20.686 --> 01:21.769

01:21.794 --> 01:26.270
It's not ♪ Hal-li-loo-yer ♪

01:26.295 --> 01:29.530

01:31.714 --> 01:33.247
You've heard of vowels.

01:33.272 --> 01:36.106
They're the things that Pat
Sajak makes you pay for.

01:38.038 --> 01:41.075
Oh, dang. He didn't get to finish.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.684
Hallelujah.

01:47.621 --> 01:50.641
_

01:55.336 --> 01:57.102
Is this hell?

01:57.756 --> 01:59.289
I guess I had that coming.

01:59.314 --> 02:02.030
That was quite a bender
you were on, Art.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.977
It's Arthur. How do you know my name?

02:04.002 --> 02:05.646
We looked through your wallet

02:05.671 --> 02:07.271
after we wrestled your pants off.

02:07.273 --> 02:08.273
You peed so much.

02:08.306 --> 02:11.854
Now you put up quite a fight.
Luckily, I'm huge.

02:12.292 --> 02:15.243
I shouldn't be here.
I'm gonna get my pants and go.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.823
Wait. We're getting ready
for a choir competition.

02:17.848 --> 02:19.479
- We need your help.
- Yeah.

02:19.504 --> 02:20.862
Just think of it as community service.

02:20.886 --> 02:25.041
This is my wife's community,
not mine, and I'm retired.

02:25.173 --> 02:28.369
"Arthur Cochran,
chair of Princeton's music department,

02:28.394 --> 02:30.728
"also known for throwing chairs,

02:30.753 --> 02:34.424
resigned after a wave
of student complaints."

02:34.449 --> 02:36.577
This is a generation
of delicate snowflakes

02:36.602 --> 02:38.702
and terrible chair duckers.

02:38.704 --> 02:40.137
Just give us 20 minutes.

02:40.139 --> 02:42.463
It'll be that long before
your pants are dry.

02:45.105 --> 02:47.604
All right. Step in.
Let's get this over with.

02:47.629 --> 02:51.025
One-time music lesson.
Posture is everything.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.851
Neck back, head forward and up.

02:53.853 --> 02:56.510
Imagine there is a string
coming out of the top

02:56.535 --> 02:58.206
of your head and you're...
It's imaginary...

02:58.230 --> 03:00.601
And your body is dangling like a puppet.

03:00.626 --> 03:01.979
Like Pinocchio,

03:02.004 --> 03:04.276
or as my father-slash-homeroom
teacher called it,

03:04.301 --> 03:06.456
- "Lying Child Gets What He Deserves."
- What does he...

03:06.480 --> 03:08.557
Reverend Jax was raised by missionaries.

03:08.582 --> 03:10.033
His family watched American movies,

03:10.058 --> 03:11.191
but they gave 'em all new titles

03:11.215 --> 03:12.260
to teach moral lessons.

03:12.285 --> 03:14.198
Yeah, he's seen every
movie Tom Hanks made.

03:14.223 --> 03:16.557
He's so good in "Don't Get Aids."

03:16.941 --> 03:18.542
Great, I'm glad you're getting
the word out on that.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.954
Let's try a chord.

03:19.979 --> 03:23.244
- ♪ C... E ♪
- ♪ E ♪

03:23.269 --> 03:25.601
- ♪ G ♪
- Stop, stop, stop.

03:25.626 --> 03:26.626
Close your eyes.

03:26.651 --> 03:28.815
Singing is about being
so utterly in sync

03:28.840 --> 03:30.612
that you don't know
where one person ends

03:30.637 --> 03:32.174
and the other begins.

03:32.199 --> 03:36.893
So we will inhale together
and on the exhale, we...

03:37.121 --> 03:40.065
- ♪ C ♪
- ♪ C ♪

03:40.090 --> 03:43.573
♪ E ♪

03:43.598 --> 03:47.588
♪ G ♪

03:47.613 --> 03:50.221
Holy crap, that's black magic!

03:50.690 --> 03:52.393
I knew it was real.
This guy's the devil.

03:52.418 --> 03:53.517
This is awesome!

03:53.542 --> 03:55.422
Look, I got chicken skin.

03:55.447 --> 03:57.299
It's a sign you were
sent here to help us.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.416
No, I don't believe in signs.

03:59.914 --> 04:02.118
Hey! Don't tow that!

04:02.143 --> 04:03.916
Hey! Hey!

04:03.941 --> 04:06.080
No, that's... that's my car!

04:06.105 --> 04:07.830
That's my car. Ow... hot!

04:07.855 --> 04:10.346
- Ouch, ow!
- You don't believe in signs?

04:10.371 --> 04:11.538
Well, what about the one that says,

04:11.562 --> 04:13.429
"No parking, tow zone"?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.581
I didn't think it'd be my problem.

04:14.605 --> 04:16.869
I thought they'd be
harvesting my organs by now.

04:17.767 --> 04:19.914
Well, since you still have your stomach,

04:19.939 --> 04:21.541
wanna fill it with a biscuit?

04:23.316 --> 04:24.955
That's toast.

04:24.980 --> 04:27.010
"Whitney Houston" ran out of biscuits.

04:27.035 --> 04:28.167
Here, take mine.

04:28.192 --> 04:29.690
It'd be a sin to leave the Moonbow

04:29.715 --> 04:31.025
without tasting one of those.

04:31.050 --> 04:32.883
You're giving me your biscuit?

04:33.198 --> 04:34.318
What are you selling?

04:34.320 --> 04:36.151
God's love, but that's free.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.865
So I guess it's on the house, friend.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.324
You're wasting your time.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.533
Well, Ginny, you and your son
have an open invitation

04:43.558 --> 04:44.691
to join my flock.

04:44.716 --> 04:46.908
Thank you, Pastor,
but our lives have been through

04:46.933 --> 04:48.549
- enough changes already.
- Darn it.

04:48.574 --> 04:50.063
Son of a bee!

04:50.088 --> 04:51.455
Cash!

04:52.041 --> 04:54.071
Good job watching your language.

04:54.073 --> 04:55.806
He got suspended for cussing out

04:55.808 --> 04:58.150
his teacher at school,
so we're practicing new words

04:58.175 --> 04:59.580
to express frustration.

04:59.605 --> 05:01.736
Ginny, we could use that
beautiful voice of yours

05:01.761 --> 05:02.823
in the choral competition.

05:02.848 --> 05:04.453
You don't need me.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.970
Like your billboard
says, you always win.

05:06.995 --> 05:08.828
Well, if you ever change your mind,

05:08.853 --> 05:11.666
Everyone's welcome at the
Church of Perpetual Praise.

05:12.967 --> 05:16.549
Hang on. The mega-church off I-75?

05:16.574 --> 05:18.783
My wife wasn't welcome there.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.360
- I don't believe we've met.
- My wife grew up here.

05:21.385 --> 05:25.412
Her final wish was to be
buried in your cemetery,

05:25.437 --> 05:26.945
but I was told there was no space.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.549
You must be Mr. Cochran.

05:28.574 --> 05:29.583
- Dr...
- Dr. Cochran.

05:29.608 --> 05:32.494
- That's right.
- I received your seven angry messages

05:32.519 --> 05:35.392
and your colorful suggestions
of what to stick where.

05:35.417 --> 05:38.111
But you're still able to walk
so I guess you didn't take 'em.

05:38.822 --> 05:40.424
I hope you find God,

05:40.719 --> 05:43.002
because if you think
it's hot in Kentucky...

05:47.127 --> 05:49.510
That's the guy whose
choir wins every year?

05:49.535 --> 05:50.822
Every year.

05:51.674 --> 05:53.299
Well, not this year.

05:54.575 --> 05:56.644
This year, your choir's gonna win,

05:56.669 --> 05:58.299
'cause I'm gonna help you.

05:59.101 --> 06:01.072
I knew there was goodness in your heart!

06:01.299 --> 06:02.892
I'm doing this out of spite.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.734
God works in mysterious ways.

06:06.891 --> 06:08.314
Ugh.

06:09.783 --> 06:12.579
I'm very excited to
properly introduce to you

06:12.604 --> 06:14.137
Dr. Arthur Cochran,

06:14.139 --> 06:16.938
professor of music at the
University of Princeton.

06:16.963 --> 06:18.985
And I know they never
make the Final Four,

06:19.010 --> 06:20.149
but outside of basketball,

06:20.174 --> 06:21.767
they're actually
considered a good school.

06:21.791 --> 06:24.439
Thank you very much for
that wonderful introduction.

06:24.464 --> 06:27.025
Okay, everybody, align your spine.

06:27.674 --> 06:28.963
Matthew McConaugh-snake,

06:28.988 --> 06:30.307
you don't need to puff out your chest

06:30.331 --> 06:32.143
like you're signaling your
wife you're ready to mate.

06:32.167 --> 06:34.681
- Ex-wife.
- Papers ain't signed yet.

06:35.681 --> 06:37.150
Could I have a quick word?

06:37.760 --> 06:39.502
Wayne is the jealous type.

06:39.527 --> 06:41.619
I think it's best if you
just stick to the music

06:41.644 --> 06:43.455
and leave the relationship
stuff out of it.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.267
Yeah, it's all intertwined. Take you.

06:46.292 --> 06:49.427
You slouch,
which hurts your vocal projection.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.080
It's caused by fear of confrontation,

06:51.105 --> 06:52.838
which is why you stayed married to a man

06:52.863 --> 06:54.565
who is preparing for "wabbit season"

06:54.590 --> 06:56.088
until one day he crosses the line.

06:56.113 --> 06:57.525
Maybe he lost all your money

06:57.550 --> 06:58.815
or let a snake loose in the house.

06:58.839 --> 07:01.010
I can see by your eyes it's both... wow!

07:01.035 --> 07:02.573
So you kicked him out,
but now you're worried

07:02.597 --> 07:03.673
it's screwing up the kid,

07:03.698 --> 07:05.713
so you haven't signed
the divorce papers.

07:06.166 --> 07:08.220
- Did you read my diary?
- I wrote it.

It's like Darth Vader ate Mufasa.

07:53.979 --> 07:55.454
Don't be mean.

07:55.479 --> 07:57.345
Dwayne has a lot of wonderful qualities

07:57.370 --> 07:58.970
that Darth Vader does not have,

07:58.995 --> 08:01.438
like a human face.

08:01.463 --> 08:04.118
It's called honesty.
It's how people get better.

08:04.143 --> 08:05.204
Agree to disagree.

08:05.229 --> 08:07.251
Ginny, our son cheats at darts.

08:07.276 --> 08:08.477
Excuse me.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.196
Cash, just let your father win.

08:11.221 --> 08:13.017
Well, you can't stop staring at her.

08:13.042 --> 08:14.345
Why don't you ask her out?

08:14.370 --> 08:16.509
I can't do that to Wayne.

08:16.534 --> 08:18.716
He's always been like
a big brother to me.

08:18.741 --> 08:20.477
He gave me all his hand-me-downs

08:20.502 --> 08:22.470
right up till I turned six
and hit my growth spurt.

08:22.494 --> 08:24.048
If you can't speak up in real life,

08:24.073 --> 08:25.095
that's your problem.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.970
But in choir, I need to hear you.

08:26.995 --> 08:28.243
Stand up straight.

08:28.268 --> 08:32.188
I want you to imagine that
your voice is a tiny ball of light.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.938
Just let it expand.

08:33.962 --> 08:35.729

08:35.754 --> 08:36.892

08:41.582 --> 08:43.727

08:47.583 --> 08:49.916
all the way back into the woods.

08:52.647 --> 08:55.887
Yes! That is your voice!

08:55.912 --> 08:58.688
Oh, you poor bastard. You love her.

09:00.572 --> 09:03.345
Nothing wrecks your life like love.

09:25.592 --> 09:29.848
How 'bout just a boney finger
sticking up out of the dirt?

09:29.873 --> 09:31.785
Is that too on the nose?

09:31.892 --> 09:33.887
Such a unique headstone.

09:33.912 --> 09:34.918
I've been meaning to ask,

09:34.943 --> 09:36.762
what is the significance of the music?

09:36.787 --> 09:37.787
Oh, that?

09:37.812 --> 09:40.348
That's a fun little ditty about a man

09:40.373 --> 09:43.278
who loses his only family
and has no reason to live.

09:46.094 --> 09:48.653
I see I've upset you. I'll leave you be.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.098
It's how we'd find
each other in a crowd.

09:53.839 --> 09:57.660
We'd whistle to each other.
It was a family tradition.

09:57.685 --> 10:00.684
My parents used Bach's
"Toccata in G Minor,"

10:00.709 --> 10:03.011
but Jean said if we were gonna
do something that ridiculous,

10:03.035 --> 10:04.467
it had to be fun.

10:05.052 --> 10:06.676
So that's...

10:08.357 --> 10:09.923
"Eye of the Tiger."

10:09.948 --> 10:11.809
From the Sylvester Stallone movie.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.411
Yeah, I don't need to
know what weird title

10:13.435 --> 10:14.918
your family gave "Rocky."

10:14.943 --> 10:17.082
It's "Rocky." What else would it be?

10:22.342 --> 10:24.934
Many were the wild notes her merry

10:24.959 --> 10:27.989
What is going on outside?

10:28.582 --> 10:30.942
♪ I dream of a Ginny ♪

10:30.967 --> 10:34.246
♪ With the light brown hair ♪

10:34.271 --> 10:36.293
Dwayne, what is this?

10:36.318 --> 10:37.319
Something I should have done

10:37.343 --> 10:38.567
- _
- ten years ago.

10:38.592 --> 10:41.226
- You need to forget this idea.
- I can't.

10:41.251 --> 10:42.750
Arthur was right.

10:42.985 --> 10:44.637
If I'm not honest with my feelings,

10:44.662 --> 10:46.348
I won't be honest with my music.

10:46.874 --> 10:48.762
Is now a good time to read a poem?

10:48.787 --> 10:50.942
What's "Eat me, D"?

10:50.967 --> 10:52.760
_

11:02.452 --> 11:03.485
What are you doing?

11:03.510 --> 11:05.143
Oh, I'm rocking the boat.

11:05.301 --> 11:07.121
You know, disrupting a delicate balance

11:07.146 --> 11:08.746
so that everything goes cattywampus

11:08.771 --> 11:10.255
and suddenly your
husband's best friend is

11:10.279 --> 11:11.590
singing love songs in your yard.

11:11.615 --> 11:13.973
He used his voice. Good for him.

11:13.998 --> 11:15.410
And bad for me.

11:15.435 --> 11:16.934
Ever since Wayne and I split,

11:16.959 --> 11:18.725
our son has been a wreck.

11:19.102 --> 11:21.192
And I need Wayne to sign
those divorce papers

11:21.217 --> 11:23.121
so Cash can start healing.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.491
But that won't happen if
Dwayne makes Wayne jealous.

11:26.516 --> 11:28.840
So you better stop stirring the pot,
Paula Deen.

11:28.865 --> 11:31.575
Shoulders back, head up,
fire in the belly.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.317
You bring this girl to choir practice,

11:33.342 --> 11:34.715
we have a shot at winning.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.301
Okay, I am ready to try one
of those famous biscuits.

11:48.326 --> 11:49.326
We're out.

11:49.351 --> 11:52.430
You're literally holding a biscuit.

11:52.637 --> 11:54.489
- Mm.
- How is it?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.199
Ginny, you have been in my prayers.

11:56.224 --> 11:57.309
Oh, really?

11:57.334 --> 11:59.621
Why don't you save your
prayers for your hairline?

11:59.646 --> 12:02.647
Jean always did like a
self-righteous blowhard.

12:02.672 --> 12:04.356
You didn't know my wife.

12:05.059 --> 12:06.207
Did you know my wife?

12:06.232 --> 12:08.762
We used to play hide-and-seek
in that cemetery.

12:08.938 --> 12:10.739
It's where we had our first kiss.

12:10.982 --> 12:12.551
But I'm sure she had other reasons

12:12.576 --> 12:14.020
for wanting to be buried there.

12:20.184 --> 12:21.184
Who wants coffee?

12:21.209 --> 12:22.817
I don't want your pity coffee.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.035
I wanna see the look on
that smug bastard's face

12:26.060 --> 12:27.092

Stop. Adams,
you're singing the wrong part.

12:39.768 --> 12:41.586
- You're an alto.
- I am a soprano.

12:41.611 --> 12:43.144
I have never sung alto.

12:43.169 --> 12:44.907
Things change as women get older.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.431
The fuck you say?

12:46.456 --> 12:47.810
Can I have a word?

12:48.376 --> 12:50.243
I'll sing alto. No big deal.

12:50.268 --> 12:51.434
It is a big deal.

12:51.459 --> 12:54.047
To win, we need the right
voices singing the right parts.

12:54.072 --> 12:55.634
- You're an alto.
- Oh, this is Cash's school.

12:55.658 --> 12:56.751
- Just one second.
- What?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.011
A pop song might be a better way
to connect with the audience.

12:59.035 --> 13:00.760
No, this is not a democracy.

13:00.785 --> 13:02.333
God may listen to you, but I don't.

13:02.358 --> 13:03.549
I have to leave.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.901
Cash may have slightly punched
a kid in his reading group.

13:05.926 --> 13:07.037
That's no reason to leave.

13:07.062 --> 13:08.151
- Excuse me?
- No.

13:08.176 --> 13:09.275
On your own time,

13:09.300 --> 13:11.834
have whatever self-destructive
delusions you want.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.221
Your son is an untapped
font of greatness.

13:15.246 --> 13:17.619
The movie butcher here
is a great communicator.

13:17.644 --> 13:19.736
And Dwayne and Wayne, totally cool

13:19.761 --> 13:21.471
that you both wanna bone the same lady.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.320
That's lovely.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.674
What the hell?

13:25.314 --> 13:27.648
You wanna bone my sweet Ginny?

13:27.650 --> 13:31.185
You home-wrecking son of a...
She'll always be my wife!

13:33.869 --> 13:37.158
Dr. Cochran,
you are no longer welcome here.

Don't you knock?
What are you doing here?

14:04.312 --> 14:05.645
Hiding from my mom.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.799
She hates you,
so no way she's coming here.

14:08.104 --> 14:10.071
Can't fault your logic there.

14:10.204 --> 14:11.752
What's up with you and butterflies?

14:11.777 --> 14:13.530
My wife liked them. Put it down.

14:13.555 --> 14:15.755
My mom says you're like the Grinch.

14:15.757 --> 14:17.283
You say you hate people,

14:17.308 --> 14:19.836
but you really hate is being alone.

14:19.861 --> 14:23.696
Yeah, well, the Grinch's wife
wanted to spend her last weeks

14:23.698 --> 14:26.032
where she was born,
and then she was gone,

14:26.034 --> 14:28.150
so the Grinch had nothing.

14:28.175 --> 14:31.548
No, he had a dog.
He was way cooler than you.

14:31.573 --> 14:33.706
You know,
with your tact and social graces,

14:33.708 --> 14:35.736
I'm shocked you're getting
into fights at school.

14:35.761 --> 14:37.020
Only during reading.

14:37.424 --> 14:39.369
Everyone laughs and calls me stupid,

14:39.688 --> 14:41.205
then I punch 'em.

14:42.325 --> 14:43.495
We're gonna try an experiment.

14:43.519 --> 14:45.762
Let's sing this together.

14:45.787 --> 14:48.354

15:04.058 --> 15:06.191
The Grinch needs to go into Whoville.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.610
Don't you ever run off like that again.

15:11.634 --> 15:13.123
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:13.148 --> 15:14.791
Thank you for returning my son to me

15:14.816 --> 15:17.322
so I can continue being
a terrible role model for him.

15:17.347 --> 15:18.846
Oh, you do have sarcasm here.

15:18.871 --> 15:20.344
What's next, bagels?

15:20.369 --> 15:22.265
You think being kind makes me weak,

15:22.290 --> 15:23.502
but it takes strength.

15:23.527 --> 15:26.485
Maybe, but you can't wrap
every problem in a hug.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.391
Take Rosemary's baby here.

15:28.416 --> 15:29.762
He's getting into fights in school

15:29.764 --> 15:30.963
because he's having trouble reading.

15:30.965 --> 15:34.100
Every time he looks at a page,
the letters float around.

15:34.102 --> 15:35.334
It's called dyslexia.

15:35.336 --> 15:37.103
A lot of successful people had it.

15:37.105 --> 15:38.791
Yeats, Churchill...

15:40.048 --> 15:41.307
Tom Cruise.

15:41.309 --> 15:43.541
- Tom Cruise?
- Supposedly.

15:44.341 --> 15:47.977
So, I didn't ruin him
by getting a divorce?

What a fun surprise.

16:34.152 --> 16:36.993
I think we should forgive him
and welcome him back.

16:37.018 --> 16:38.355
You know, that's an important lesson

16:38.379 --> 16:40.486
in choirs and in marriages.

16:41.252 --> 16:43.190
Wayne, enough.

16:43.424 --> 16:45.908
I am not changing my mind.

16:45.933 --> 16:48.041
So you need to sign those divorce papers

16:48.066 --> 16:50.790
and get all nine snakes
out of the garage.

16:50.815 --> 16:52.724
- Should be more than that.
- Everyone else,

16:52.749 --> 16:55.224
whatever petty grudge
you are carrying, just drop it.

16:55.249 --> 16:56.849
We have a chance to come together

16:56.874 --> 16:58.974
and do something amazing.

16:58.999 --> 17:01.132
And he is a part of that.

17:01.157 --> 17:03.998
This crusty, unpleasant man

17:04.022 --> 17:07.003
who is so difficult that
he got rejected by a graveyard.

17:07.029 --> 17:08.669
- It's true.
- And lucky for us, he did.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.123
Because we take anyone,
no matter how low

17:12.147 --> 17:13.223
- or hated...
- Amen.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.378
- Or despised...
- Okay, okay, okay. You made your point.

17:15.403 --> 17:16.435
- Thank you.

20:17.352 --> 20:18.532
Eye of the tiger,

20:18.556 --> 20:21.680
eye of the tiger, eye of the tiger...

20:24.445 --> 20:25.758
You think he'll be mad with you?

20:25.760 --> 20:27.969
- He's always mad.
- Wayne, just say good-bye.

20:27.994 --> 20:31.028
Okay, Snappy,
Arthur's gonna take care of you now.

20:31.053 --> 20:33.188
What in God's name is
happening right now?

20:33.213 --> 20:34.813
Surprise! Happy house-warming.

20:34.838 --> 20:36.245
Welcome to our church family.

20:36.270 --> 20:37.937
We brought you few
things you might need:

20:37.939 --> 20:40.439
milk, eggs, a multi-pack of deodorant.

20:40.441 --> 20:42.453
- No, thank you.
- Oops, it's used.

20:42.478 --> 20:43.540
Can't return it now.

20:43.564 --> 20:45.621
How many eggs do you want, eight or ten?

20:45.646 --> 20:48.314
That's not a number
of eggs a human eats.

20:48.316 --> 20:49.415
This is it.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.711
You put this on with some wingtips,
we'll be talking.

20:51.736 --> 20:54.117
You can't just barge in here
and go through my stuff...

20:54.142 --> 20:55.188
That's incredible.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.200
Now stop fussing and sit down.

20:57.225 --> 20:58.391
You don't want company,

20:58.393 --> 21:00.157
well, you picked the wrong
group to make friends with.

21:00.181 --> 21:02.071
Yes, we are loving yet pushy,

21:02.096 --> 21:04.219
like Mary Poppins in
the classic Disney film,

21:04.244 --> 21:05.877
"Unmarried Women Cause Trouble."

21:05.902 --> 21:07.944
- Mm.
- No, this is not your color.

21:07.969 --> 21:09.134
You need to give this to someone

21:09.158 --> 21:10.491
who pops in jewel tones.

21:10.516 --> 21:11.715
- Who else wants eggs?
- Ooh.

21:11.740 --> 21:13.313
Speaking of eggs, anyone see Snappy?

21:16.039 --> 21:17.320
God, help me.

21:17.445 --> 21:21.000
