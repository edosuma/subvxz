09:12.585 --> 09:14.120
WILL YOU BE
MY MAIDS OF HONOR?

09:17.557 --> 09:20.427
SINCE I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND,
MAYBE IT'D BE BEST

09:20.427 --> 09:22.128
IF I JUST TOOK THE LEAD
ON THIS.

09:22.128 --> 09:25.198
BUT SINCE I HAVE NEVER
DECLARED BANKRUPTCY,

09:25.198 --> 09:28.234
IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE
FOR ME TO RUN POINT.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.637
OR YOU GUYS CAN WORK TOGETHER
AS A TEAM.

09:30.637 --> 09:31.704
[CHUCKLES]

09:36.042 --> 09:38.611

JUST WON THE HUNGER GAMES.

09:38.611 --> 09:41.347

YOU AND YOUR FICTION.

09:41.347 --> 09:44.017

09:46.052 --> 09:47.654
TO MEET YOU IN THE PARK
FOR TARGET PRACTICE,

09:47.654 --> 09:49.022
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BEING RANDY.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.023

NOW MY HOMEMADE

09:51.591 --> 09:52.692
SEEM OUT OF PLACE.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.661
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT

09:54.661 --> 09:57.564
THAT SINCE WE'RE NOT
SNEAKING AROUND ANYMORE,

09:57.564 --> 10:00.100
THAT THIS WAS THE PERFECT SPOT
FOR OUR FIRST DATE.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.503
MM-HMM.
THIS IS WHERE I COME
TO LET MY HAIR DOWN.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.704
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:04.704 --> 10:06.406
I-I'D OFFER TO JOIN YOU,

10:06.406 --> 10:09.642

WHAT WE CAN SALVAGE

10:13.546 --> 10:15.682
OF THE REST OF THIS DATE,

10:15.682 --> 10:18.551
AND MAYBE NEXT WEEKEND,
WE CAN DO SOMETHING
THAT WE BOTH ENJOY.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.120
LIKE THE OPERA.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.156
[GASPS] I CAN'T THINK OF
A BETTER WAY TO SPEND SIX HOURS.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.058
I'LL GET US THE BEST SEATS

10:27.260 --> 10:28.461
I HAD JUST ASSUMED
YOU'D AGREE

10:28.461 --> 10:31.197
THAT ORCHESTRA SEATS
PUT YOU RIGHT IN THE ACTION.

10:31.197 --> 10:35.235
AND I JUST ASSUMED THAT
YOU WOULD PREFER THE UPPER LOGE.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.670
I-IT'S LIKE WATCHING THE PLAY
AS GOD.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.106
UH, SORRY.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.307
HOW'S OUR

10:41.307 --> 10:44.144
OH, NOT TO TOOT
MY OWN BAGPIPES, BUT...

10:44.144 --> 10:45.545

I...AM, UM...

10:56.489 --> 10:58.424
JUST MAKING
ANOTHER DELIVERY.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.693
WHY'S A BAGEL GUY
DELIVERING A HOLE PUNCHER?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.052
OH, FUN.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.654
I AM NEVER WEARING PANTS
AGAIN.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.722
OH, I THINK
IT'S SO ROMANTIC

11:29.722 --> 11:31.658
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY CHANGING
YOUR NAME BEFORE THE WEDDING.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.560
OH, WELL, I WANTED
TO SURPRISE YOUR DAD

11:33.560 --> 11:34.594
BY BECOMING
A REAL HARRISON.

JUST WHEN I THOUGHT YOU
COULDN'T GET ANY MORE WHITE...

11:37.230 --> 11:38.531

FROM YOUR...ZOO-ANIMAL NAME

12:16.603 --> 12:19.639
ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS,
YOU'RE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.975
[CHUCKLING] WHAT?
THAT'S CRAZY. NO, NO.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.543

AN I.N.S. INTERVIEW WILL BE

YOU'LL NEED TO PROVE
THE LEGITIMACY OF YOUR MARRIAGE

TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.655

I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.443
STEVE -- HE'S NOT
A BAGEL DELIVERY GUY.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.446
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL
YOU THAT STEVE AND I ARE --

13:00.446 --> 13:01.281
WE'RE DATING.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.230
WHO?
RUSS BRADLEY.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.198
BECAUSE I SPRUNG

AS FENCING.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.268

A LITTLE BIT WORRIED

THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT THE PERFECT
MATCH THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.573
WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAD
ONE AWKWARD DATE?

13:27.573 --> 13:29.342
I'M PROUD OF YOU
FOR PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.743

KATE, I DON'T EVEN REALLY CARE
ABOUT RUSS.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.380
I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON
I WAS TELLING YOU

13:34.380 --> 13:37.283
IS BECAUSE I KNOW HOW OBSESSED
YOU ARE WITH GOSSIP.

13:37.283 --> 13:40.019

JUST -- GET BACK TO YOUR "TMZ."

IS THAT WHY YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE A COUNSELOR AT A FAT CAMP?

THAT I EXISTED.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.596
STEVE:
I DIDN'T ASK HIM ABOUT HIMSELF,
I DIDN'T COMPLIMENT HIM.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.299
THEN HE GAVE ME BUTTERSCOTCHES,
AND I BLEW IT.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.067
YOU KNOW WHAT
MIGHT HELP YOU FEEL BETTER?

17:15.668 --> 17:17.169
COMPLIMENTING MY BRAID.

17:17.169 --> 17:18.571
IS THAT YOUR CAR?

17:18.571 --> 17:20.439
OH, WHAT DO I SAY?

17:20.439 --> 17:22.508
WELL, YOU MIGHT
SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

17:22.508 --> 17:24.143
"WOW, JACKIE,
I HAVEN'T SEEN A BRAID" --

17:24.143 --> 17:27.146
OH, ABOUT BERT.
UM, SAY WHATEVER.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.481
CAN I GET IN?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.483
UH, YEAH.
YEAH, SURE.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.118
WHAT DOES THIS DO?

17:32.118 --> 17:33.152
UH...

17:33.152 --> 17:36.055
UH, THAT PUTS THE TOP UP.
YOU WANT TO PUSH IT?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.156
SURE.
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.126
OH, AWESOME!

17:40.126 --> 17:42.094
STEVE: RIGHT?
JACKIE:
YEAH! LIKE MY BRAID.

17:42.094 --> 17:43.996
WHAT DOES THIS DO?

17:43.996 --> 17:45.231
OH, THAT IS A,
UH, CUP HOLDER.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.033
WHAT, YOU NEVER BEEN
IN A CAR BEFORE?

17:47.033 --> 17:48.534
[CHUCKLES]

17:48.534 --> 17:50.002
TOO -- TOO SOON?

17:50.002 --> 17:51.671
[CLEARS THROAT] YOU'LL
BE HEARING FROM US SHORTLY.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.705
[SIGHS]
WE FAILED, DIDN'T WE?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.206
DON'T MIND ME.

17:54.206 --> 17:58.678
I JUST REALIZED THAT PETER AND
I NEVER SEPARATED OUR NOVA DVDS

17:58.678 --> 18:01.514
AFTER THE DIVORCE,
SO I'D LIKE TO DO IT NOW.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.249
OKAY, DIANE,
NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.218
WAIT. IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
ARE YOU CHEWING GUM?

18:06.218 --> 18:08.287
NO. [SMACKS LIPS]
I'M NOT CHEWING GUM.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.056
[SWALLOWS]
I HAD A GREAT DAY.

18:10.056 --> 18:13.059
UH, I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF
ANYBODY WANTED TO GET SOME PIZZA

18:13.059 --> 18:15.027
OR MAYBE
SHARE SOME ICE CREAM.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.062
I'M SORRY. WHO'S THIS?

18:16.062 --> 18:17.096
THAT'S MY EX-WIFE.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.431
JACKIE:
GUESS WHAT, PEOPLE?

18:18.431 --> 18:22.101
THE BAGEL BOY'S NOT JUST
"THE BAGEL BOY" ANYMORE,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.203
SO WE BROUGHT SOME BAGELS
TO CELEBRATE, Y'ALL.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.639
WE'RE OFFICIALLY
A THREESOME!

18:26.639 --> 18:29.542
AND THIS IS...?
PETE:
THAT'S MY OTHER EX-WIFE.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.545
YOU KNOW, THESE TWO
DO NOT NEED GREEN CARDS.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.546
THEY'RE BOTH AMERICAN.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.715
TECHNICALLY,
I WAS BORN ON A RESERVATION.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.017
AND I'M FROM CHINA!

18:38.017 --> 18:40.086
BERT, WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE
WARREN IN THE GARAGE.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.021
I'M AFRAID
OF THE GARAGE.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.390
DAD, OUR WHOLE LIVES
HAVE BEEN A LIE.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.692
[CHUCKLES]
HI.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.361
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.129
WE'RE BELGIAN, DAD.
BELGIAN.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.564
WE NEED TO EIGHTY-SIX
THE KILTS.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.033
PETE: UH...
HILLARY,
I CALLED THE HOTEL.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.068
THEY WON'T LET US PLAY
"PIN THE JUNK ON THE HUNK,"

18:56.068 --> 18:58.304
SO I THINK
YOU SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING

18:58.304 --> 19:00.039
AND RESIGN FROM YOUR POSITION
AS CO-MAID OF HONOR.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.108
SIR, EXACTLY HOW MANY WOMEN
ARE LIVING HERE?

19:02.108 --> 19:03.342
HOW MANY FEMALES
LIVE HERE? TWO.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.044
[ALL TALKING]
KATE,
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

19:05.044 --> 19:07.413
WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT
NOW? ARE WE SCOTTISH OR NOT?!

19:07.413 --> 19:09.148
IT'S NOT A CRIME.
HEY! LOOK! STOP!

19:10.049 --> 19:12.752
HILLARY,
YOU LOVE TO BOSS PEOPLE AROUND.
OH, I DO.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.021
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF THE LOGISTICS OF THE WEDDING.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.255
MEG, YOU HATE
RESPONSIBILITY.
I DO.

19:16.255 --> 19:17.556
YOU TAKE CARE OF DEBAUCHERY.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.659
TOGETHER, YOU MAKE ONE PERFECT
MAID OF HONOR. BOOM.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.128
WARREN,
OUR BLOOD MAY BE BELGIAN,

19:22.128 --> 19:24.997
BUT OUR LEGS BELONG
IN THE SCOTTISH ISLANDS.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.166
WE ARE GONNA
ROCK THOSE KILTS, BABY.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.068
YES!
I'M GONNA GO TAKE MY PANTS OFF.

19:29.068 --> 19:33.105
AND, DIANE, DON'T WAIT FOR
YOUR...PATIENT TO CALL YOU.

19:33.105 --> 19:36.142
CALL HIM, BECAUSE YOU
ARE DR. DIANE BUCKLEY.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.611
YEAH. TEAM DIANE!
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

19:38.611 --> 19:41.380
THANK YOU. [CLEARS THROAT]
THAT'S VERY GOOD ADVICE, KATE.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.448
UH, EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.150
WELL, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

19:45.351 --> 19:49.155
THIS IS CLEARLY
NOT A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE...

19:50.556 --> 19:52.558
...BECAUSE NOTHING ABOUT IT
IS CONVENIENT.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.727
MA'AM, I CONGRATULATE YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.629
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET DEPORTED!

19:56.629 --> 19:58.097
[SINGSONG VOICE]
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WEDDING!

19:58.097 --> 20:00.466
WHOO!
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A WEDDING!

20:00.466 --> 20:02.001
GONNA HAVE
A WEDDING!
GONNA HAVE
A WEDDING!

20:02.001 --> 20:03.069
PSST! PSST! PSST!
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WE--

20:03.069 --> 20:04.136
KATE.
SHH-SHH.

20:04.136 --> 20:07.273
UM, HI [CLEARS THROAT] RUSS.
IT'S DIANE.

20:07.273 --> 20:10.309
OH, YOU HADN'T CALLED FOR
A LITTLE WHILE, SO I WAS JUST --

20:10.309 --> 20:13.446
OH, I SEE.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.015
HE'S ORDERED US TWO TICKETS
FOR THE OPERA

20:16.015 --> 20:17.249
ON THE MEZZANINE LEVEL.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.384
BE COOL.

20:18.384 --> 20:22.221
UM...THAT WOULD BE
A LOVELY...COMPROMISE.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.190
OKAY. YOU KNOW,
FOR AN IMMIGRANT,

20:24.190 --> 20:25.758
YOU GIVE VERY GOOD ADVICE.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.059
THANK YOU.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.595
EVERYONE, I AM
OFFICIALLY DATING...

20:29.595 --> 20:31.731
RUSS BRADLEY MORRISON.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.200
YOU'RE DATING
BRADY ROSS' DAD?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.435
[LAUGHING] AWESOME!
I FINALLY HAVE MY IN!

20:36.435 --> 20:40.272
DIANE: YEAH, COME SEE!
HE CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU GUYS.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.641
JACKIE:
EVERYBODY, HAVE A BAGEL!

20:46.445 --> 20:48.114
I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU
TO MEET MY MOM.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.281
I MEAN, SHE IS CRAZY,
LIKE I SAID, BUT FUN,

20:49.281 --> 20:51.217
BUT -- BUT CUCKOO.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.586
[GASPS]

20:53.586 --> 20:55.287
KATIE!

20:55.287 --> 20:56.155
THAT'S HER!

20:56.155 --> 20:58.224
MOM,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:58.224 --> 20:59.258
OH, NOTHING.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.260
I MEAN,
I JUST BARELY GROPED HIM.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.162
I JUST KIND OF GAVE HIM
A BUTT PINCH

21:03.162 --> 21:04.296
WHEN HE GAVE ME
ANOTHER BOTTLE OF VODKA.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.132
YOU KNOW, I'VE SAID IT BEFORE
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN --

21:06.132 --> 21:08.000
THEY NEVER SHOULD'VE LET MEN
BECOME STEWARDESSES.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.136
IT IS JUST
TOO MUCH TEMPTATION.

21:10.136 --> 21:13.739
OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT YOU.
I JUST WANT TO EAT YOU UP!

21:13.739 --> 21:15.508
BUT FIRST, I KIND OF NEED YOU
TO PAY MY BAIL.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.210
IT IS SO NICE TO MEET YOU!
I'M CRICKET!

21:18.210 --> 21:19.612
MMM-MWAH!

21:19.612 --> 21:21.213
JIMMY, COME ON!

21:23.182 --> 21:24.617
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
