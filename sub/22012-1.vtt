00:01.369 --> 00:03.237
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
my life changed forever

00:03.304 --> 00:05.139
when I saw the movie
Weird Science.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.041
For a geek like me,
nothing was cooler

00:07.108 --> 00:09.943
than two social
outcasts using their
tricked-out computer

00:10.010 --> 00:11.779
to create a magical
dream-woman.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.214
Was it absurd?
Sure.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.283
Did it stop me?
No.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.586
(ADAM CHANTING GIBBERISH)

00:24.658 --> 00:27.995
By the way, why are we
wearing bras on our heads?

00:28.062 --> 00:29.063
Ceremonial.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.431
Cut.
So how'd we do?

00:30.498 --> 00:32.200
May I just point out
how incredibly flawed

00:32.266 --> 00:33.901
the gender politics
of all of this is?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.103
Please don't judge me.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.504
I just have
an unhealthy desire

00:36.570 --> 00:38.072
to live in each and every
John Hughes movie.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.607
I'm just hoping
this actually works

00:39.673 --> 00:41.642
and we magically create
a foxy babe for me
to smooch on.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.011
Wait, you do realize
none of this is real.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.146
Let Dave Kim have this.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.547
Show time.

00:46.614 --> 00:47.748
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

00:48.882 --> 00:50.218
It worked?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.287
Yes!
I built an Erica.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.955
Hey, weirdos.
I'm leaving for college

00:55.022 --> 00:56.824
in 30 minutes,
and I need my bras.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.127
Ew!
I put it on my head!

00:59.193 --> 01:01.529
You told me these belonged
to your grandma.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.397
Which is not much better
now that I saw it out loud.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.698
Okay, I'm off to college.

01:04.765 --> 01:08.001
Adam, I'll miss you.
Dave Kim, the opposite.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.470
You keep telling
yourself that.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.038
(GAGS)

01:11.105 --> 01:13.274
ADULT ADAM:
I particularly related
to the brother dynamics.

01:13.341 --> 01:17.411
Wyatt was bullied by Chet,
and I had to live with Barry.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.347
Hey, that's my serving
of fruit for the day.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.582
Oh, then maybe you should
have some punch.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.683
Ow!

01:22.750 --> 01:23.817
Okay, morons.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.653
We're only gonna be gone
for three days.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.555
Try and be alive
when we get back.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.257
All right,
that's everything.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.259
Whoa, what's
all this stuff?

01:31.325 --> 01:33.527
When I went to college,
all I brought were some
flip-flops and a cookie.

01:33.594 --> 01:37.365
Hold on, Shmoo.
There is one thing you forgot.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.567
Time to give Mama
all the kisses.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.669
Oh, come on, dude.
Really?

01:41.735 --> 01:44.272
It's what we've done
every first day of school
since kindergarten.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.640
Now, give me all the kisses
so I can store 'em away

01:46.707 --> 01:48.809
for a rainy day
like little love-acorns.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.944
No, I don't even remember
how to do it.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.813
Easy.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.615
Eskimo kiss,

01:54.682 --> 01:56.150
butterfly kiss,

01:56.217 --> 01:58.219
cheek kiss, cheek kiss,

01:58.286 --> 02:00.554
and one last kiss
for your palm

02:00.621 --> 02:03.624
to ball up
and stick in your heart.

02:03.691 --> 02:04.825
Gotcha.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.394
Well I am gonna put this
in my bag for later.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.530
Don't put my kiss
in your dark duffel bag.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.299
Take it out and put it
in your heart.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.766
Stick my kiss
in your heart.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.935
I don't want the kiss, Mom.
Okay, okay. Stop.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.104
I will take your precious kiss
out of the dark bag

02:17.171 --> 02:18.672
and put it in my heart.

02:18.739 --> 02:19.940
Fake out. It's gone.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.075
No! I caught it, and I'm
throwing it back to you.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.577
No, take it back.
You take it.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.845
Take this kiss, Mom.
You keep it.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.146
I'm not going to college
with a kiss.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.014
You're killing me.
Quit it.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.216
I don't want it!

02:28.282 --> 02:30.184
This is gonna be
a long car ride.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.885
* Weird science

02:35.088 --> 02:37.325
ADULT ADAM: It was August 27,
1980-something,

02:37.391 --> 02:38.526
college move-in day,

02:38.592 --> 02:40.494
or for my mom,
the end of the world.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.364
I can't believe we're already
moving you into college.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.832
It seems like only yesterday,

02:44.898 --> 02:46.400
I was trying to get
your preschool teacher fired

02:46.467 --> 02:48.101
for letting you
smell those toxic markers.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.503
I hate this humidity.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.805
It feels like someone
opened up a dishwasher

02:51.872 --> 02:53.207
mid-cycle in my pants.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.608
You can change
your swampy chinos

02:54.675 --> 02:56.076
when you get
to Erica's room.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.545
Got it.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.812
ERICA: Listen, I know
it's hard to say goodbye,

02:58.879 --> 03:00.448
which is why I'm giving you
a very generous

03:00.514 --> 03:02.450
three hours to part ways.
Cool?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.418
Not cool.
I need 6 to 20.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.054
Mom, look around.
Where are we right now?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.456
D.C. School of the Arts.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.224
And who got in off
the wait-list last-minute,

03:10.291 --> 03:12.360
enraging Dad 'cause he lost
his deposit at Emory?

03:12.426 --> 03:13.794
You.
Point is, I know it goes

03:13.861 --> 03:15.329
against everything
you stand for,

03:15.396 --> 03:17.231
but you have
to say goodbye.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.767
Bye. Bye, now.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.201
Ta-ta.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.703
See you
on the flip-flop.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.971
What are you doing?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.639
Practicing the different
ways of saying goodbye.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.508
It's gonna be very hard
when that day comes.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.942
That day is now.
Leave that.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.044
Go get the rest of your stuff
out of the car,

03:31.111 --> 03:32.346
and I'll help you unpack.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.516
Hello.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.685
By any chance, are you
Erica Goldberg's R.A.?

03:37.751 --> 03:40.421
Yes. I'm Srini.
You must be Erica's mother.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.290
Don't worry. Your daughter's
in great hands.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.358
Ah, that is
so good to hear.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.527
Now shut your (BLEEP) mouth
and do everything

03:46.594 --> 03:48.262
I'm about to tell you.
Oh, dear.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.763
You might be
the other kids' R.A.,

03:49.830 --> 03:51.932
but when it comes to my
little pickle, you're me.

03:51.999 --> 03:55.303
It's your job to see
that she's fed, well-rested,

03:55.369 --> 03:57.070
and regular.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.872
Actually, I'm pretty sure
my job is to hand out
pamphlets

03:58.939 --> 04:00.908
and make sure no one's
being loud after 10:00.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.175
Not anymore.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.477
Here's a variety
of medicines to help

04:03.544 --> 04:05.779
with Erica's allergies
and sour tummy.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.316
Now, if flu season
comes early this year,

04:08.382 --> 04:09.483
how's your
chicken soup game?

04:09.550 --> 04:10.851
Soup's really
not my area.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.786
I'm more of
a resident advisor.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.922
You have a freezer
in your mini-fridge.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.758
Keep this in there
in case of emergencies.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.593
I can take out
the tiny little ice tray,

04:19.660 --> 04:21.161
but I'm still not sure
that would fit.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.830
You have given me
zero confidence

04:22.896 --> 04:25.299
that you are up
for this important task.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.567
I agree.
I'm not up to it.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.569
Oh, there she is.
There's my baby.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.838
Erica, this is Srini,
your R.A.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.607
Hi. I'm Erica.
I hope my mom is behaving.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.476
Um, she's, uh...
Ah...

04:35.543 --> 04:36.744
So, what room am I in?

04:36.810 --> 04:40.648
Um, 103
with Erica Coolidge.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.849
Oh, no.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.584
You're both named Erica.
Please don't be mad.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.353
It's crazy
how much you care.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.455
Erica, you're
in very good hands.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.625
Hey!
Hi, I'm your roommate,

04:51.692 --> 04:52.993
apparently also Erica.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.194
Like, hi.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.696
I totally for sure
call top bunk,

04:55.763 --> 04:58.332
mostly 'cause your dad
already took the bottom.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.735
Oh, your roomie's
a valley girl.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.237
Just like in that movie
where everybody's rude
and unlikable.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.773
She'll be gone very soon.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.608
Anyway, it's nice
to finally meet.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.976
For sure.
For sure.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.077
For sure.
For sure.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.612
For sure.
For sure.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.214
Or whatever.
I'm not mocking your people.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.916
Aw.
This is so great.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.719
You two are
gonna be best friends
for the rest of your...

05:18.786 --> 05:20.788
Oh, no!
Is that a hot plate?

05:20.854 --> 05:21.855
That has got to go.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.424
You're gonna burn
the place down.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.892
You know, that's how
Buddy Holly died.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.294
Bevy, Buddy Holly died
in a plane crash.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.697
We don't know there wasn't
a hot plate on that plane.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.899
She'll be gone soon, Erica.
Just hang in there.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.368
She's totally a barf bag,
but I'll manage.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.604
I was actually
talking to myself.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.539
Sorry I called your mom
a barf bag.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.307
No, no.
Your instincts are good.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.342
ADULT ADAM:
While Erica couldn't wait
to lose my mom,

05:42.410 --> 05:44.111
my brother was trying
to find love.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.613
Prepare yourselves, ladies.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.781
The impossible
is now possible.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.417
Barry Goldberg is
on the open market.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.884
Um, what is this?

05:50.951 --> 05:51.985
Your destiny.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.687
So, who amongst you
is ready to battle

05:53.754 --> 05:55.789
in a Thunderdome-like
cage match for my affection?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.391
Dude, what world
do you live in?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.159
You're, like,
a 2 at best.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.861
ADULT ADAM: Naturally,
Barry was delighted
by the flirtation

06:00.928 --> 06:03.664
until he realized
just bad he got burned.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.700
Like always, he took it out
on me and my pudding cup.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.968
Why?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.336
Huge news, baby brother.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.939
My senior year of awesome
begins now.

06:12.005 --> 06:15.543
I've got a three-part plan
to achieve legendary status.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.145
Step 1, lock down a new
girlfriend way hotter

06:18.211 --> 06:19.513
and smarter than Lainey.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.550
I'm realistic, which is why
I've allotted 48 hours

06:22.616 --> 06:24.585
for her to find me.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.019
It's in her court now.

06:26.086 --> 06:29.289
Step 2, become starting
varsity power forward?

06:29.356 --> 06:31.692
Weren't you kicked
off the basketball team
in seventh grade?

06:31.759 --> 06:33.226
Well, Coach McCoy said
I could join the team

06:33.293 --> 06:34.928
after I learned
how to pass.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.598
But he died,
so the ball-hog's back.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.600
Next?
Wait. Step 3 is me.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.134
What does that even mean?

06:41.201 --> 06:43.437
I've penciled you in for
a daily display of dominance

06:43.504 --> 06:45.573
and humiliation
to boost my visibility

06:45.639 --> 06:48.175
in front of the more
popular, meaner kids.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.610
It's so detailed.

06:49.677 --> 06:53.881
Purple nurples, dead arms,
swirlies, butt hat.

06:53.947 --> 06:54.982
What's a butt hat?

06:55.048 --> 06:57.518
Aw, I hate this hat.
Take it off!

06:57.585 --> 06:59.453
BARRY: Show's over,
folks.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.121
You did good work
today, champ.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.890
Love you.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.858
Well, we now know
what a butt hat is.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.126
This is bad.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.761
Without Lainey around,
Barry's gonna concentrate

07:07.828 --> 07:09.497
all his horrible
energy on me.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.331
Well, there's only
one thing left to do,

07:11.398 --> 07:12.666
find him
a new girlfriend.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.134
Let me help.
Don't.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.337
He has a wildly unrealistic
view of his general appeal.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.572
Lainey fell for him,
right?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.040
She was a unicorn.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.510
There's no way we'll ever
find someone so blind

07:22.576 --> 07:24.177
to Barry's idiocy
ever again.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.679
Well, maybe I can.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.481
Just give me a list
of the things he's looking for

07:27.548 --> 07:28.882
and we can find him a girl.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.584
I'll try, but he doesn't
really open up to me

07:30.651 --> 07:32.486
besides his butt cheeks
to make a hat.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.522
Yeah, I wouldn't
keep bringing that up.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.157
ADULT ADAM:
As I enlisted Jackie
to help find a girl for Barry,

07:37.224 --> 07:39.392
Erica had finally
found peace in her dorm,

07:39.459 --> 07:40.728
or so she thought.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.929
Oh, there you are.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.264
I have something
special for you.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.701
Um, that's like every lame
R.A. pamphlet that exists.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.503
Please, just take them.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.772
And maybe, please,
let your mom know
that I gave them to you.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.373
Sure.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.075
Wow.
Right in front of me.

07:55.142 --> 07:59.980
I just met a totally radical
guitarist, so don't wait up.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.082
Really? 'Cause I thought
that we could hang out

08:02.149 --> 08:03.050
and get to know each other.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.018
I feel like
I already know you

08:05.085 --> 08:07.921
because your mom's
been telling me, like,
a lot of stories.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.489
Why are my parents
still here?

08:09.557 --> 08:12.492
Your dad napped and then took
a cab back to the hotel.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.662
He's a sweaty man.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.064
Anyway, like, bye.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.800
ADULT ADAM:
Erica knew it was time
to send my mom home...

08:19.867 --> 08:21.101
Ta-da!

08:21.168 --> 08:23.771
...but my mom brought
our entire home to her.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.138
This seems concerning.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.740
I made it look just like
your old bedroom

08:26.807 --> 08:27.941
so you wouldn't
get homesick.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.177
Oh, I even
brought Donnie,

08:30.243 --> 08:32.412
your favorite new boy
in the neighborhood.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.681
He's a New Kid
on the Block,

08:33.747 --> 08:36.016
he doesn't belong here,
and neither do you.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.150
Just please go.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.519
Oh, I can't leave now.
It's dark outside.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.721
So?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.422
So, I have horrible
night vision

08:42.489 --> 08:43.924
and can't get
behind the wheel.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.893
You have a perfectly good
bed back at your motel.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.828
You need to get
in the car and go.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.297
And miss a turn and hit
a semi and flip the car

08:50.363 --> 08:52.032
and end up pinned under
the steering wheel

08:52.099 --> 08:54.034
while the station wagon
burns around me?

08:54.101 --> 08:56.036
Is that what you want
for your mother?

08:56.103 --> 08:59.940
ADULT ADAM:
It was classic Bev guilt,
which totally worked.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.241
College is fun.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.844
While Erica settled in
for a co-ed nightmare,

09:03.911 --> 09:06.580
Barry was dreaming about
his old flame Lainey Lewis.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.682
Hey, handsome.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.718
Just for fun
and no other reason,

09:10.784 --> 09:12.352
what qualities are you
looking for in a lover?

09:12.419 --> 09:15.322
Wait, why are you asking me
about beautiful bikini babes?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.858
I just thought, maybe,
I could help you find
a new girlfriend

09:17.925 --> 09:19.860
to start your year of awesome.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.896
What would I let someone
who wears my butt as a hat
set me up with a girl?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.798
ADULT ADAM: As expected,
Barry wasn't biting,

09:24.865 --> 09:26.700
so I had to get creative.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.870
Too bad, 'cause my plan
was to Weird Science you
up a hot girl.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.772
Dude, a computer
can't really do that.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.073
It can do anything.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.642
Did you know a computer
just defeated

09:34.708 --> 09:36.476
the world's greatest
chess champion?

09:36.543 --> 09:37.645
In chess?
Yes!

09:37.711 --> 09:40.380
No! Why wasn't I told?

09:40.447 --> 09:41.915
Stupid Dan Rather!

09:41.982 --> 09:43.717
Just jot down some things
you might like in a lady,

09:43.784 --> 09:46.319
and I'll use list to
whip you up a hot babe
of your liking.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.922
While I'm excited to put
all my eggs in this basket,

09:48.989 --> 09:51.058
I still need
scientific proof.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.394
Mr. Connelly,
it's a scholastic emergency!

09:54.461 --> 09:56.063
Come as fast as you can.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.597
You're a really
good science teacher.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.966
I... I got a question.
No, no.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.701
Don't bother the man.
Zip it, little nerd.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.102
I need to talk
to the big nerd.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.072
Sir, in your expert
scientific opinion,

10:05.138 --> 10:08.642
is it possible for me to
Weird Science up a girlfriend?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.510
ADULT ADAM:
It was game-over.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.845
Scientifically speaking...

10:11.912 --> 10:14.581
My teacher always
took science seriously.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.649
...absolutely.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.984
Until he didn't.

10:17.050 --> 10:17.885
I knew it!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.352
Watch out, Kelly LeBrock.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.921
Big Tasty's comin' for ya.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.522
Why would you lie
like that?

10:22.589 --> 10:23.891
Between you and me,

10:23.957 --> 10:25.993
I have a butt-wad of
an older brother, too.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.561
You know, I'm using that movie
to find him a girlfriend
so he won't beat me up.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.063
Would he actually
fall for that?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.198
Dude, come on!

10:31.264 --> 10:33.066
Let's go make me
this girl already.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.768
Every week,
he surprises us.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.336
Whoo!
Year of awesome!

10:45.312 --> 10:46.980
ADULT ADAM:
My mom was so psyched
to be spending

10:47.047 --> 10:48.381
the first night
of college with Erica,

10:48.448 --> 10:49.783
she literally couldn't sleep.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.852
Okay, stop.
What are you doing?

10:51.919 --> 10:54.021
Assembling your
safety credenza.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.324
First aid, fire ladder,
canned foods, powdered milk,

10:57.390 --> 10:59.659
and a handheld siren
to alert rescuers

10:59.727 --> 11:00.861
when you're
caught in rubble.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.595
It's really loud.
Want to hear?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.765
I am in college.
I don't need any credenzas.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.666
Now go to bed
before someone finds out

11:06.734 --> 11:08.235
that you're still here.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.236
Evening, Erica.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.570
I wanted to inform
you and Erica

11:10.637 --> 11:11.939
of tonight's freshman mixer

11:12.005 --> 11:13.774
that the school has
mandated me to throw.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.442
"Jamaican' Me Crazy" party?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.711
Ya, mon!

11:17.778 --> 11:18.946
This doesn't come
naturally to me.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.447
Can this be over, now?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.082
As long as you're there.
The kids you meet tonight

11:22.149 --> 11:24.017
might end up being
your friends for life.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.686
Of course, my college friends
are now doctors and lawyers

11:26.754 --> 11:28.121
while I pursue
a foolish dream

11:28.188 --> 11:29.823
of making art
from everyday garbage.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.491
Like Nick
from Family Ties?

11:31.558 --> 11:32.726
It was my idea first.

11:32.793 --> 11:33.961
Anyway, uh,
thanks for the invite,

11:34.027 --> 11:35.863
but I have company
in here already.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.331
As in
romantic company?

11:38.398 --> 11:39.632
Why do you care?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.234
I just don't know what
I'm gonna tell your mother!

11:41.301 --> 11:43.403
She got to you, didn't she?
You've been compromised.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.539
Srini betrayed me!
Open that door.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.843
No way! No one can ever know
about this shameful night.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.211
(ALARM RINGS)

11:51.278 --> 11:52.813
Is that a fire alarm?
I hear a fire alarm.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.647
Mom, relax.
This is college.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.616
Kids pull alarms
every two seconds.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.251
No, you're right.
You're right.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.487
I'll just hang here
and keep a low profile...

12:00.553 --> 12:02.022
And I smell smoke!

12:02.089 --> 12:03.423
Move!
(HANDHELD SIREN BLARES)

12:03.490 --> 12:06.493
Follow the sound of
my hand siren to safety.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.628
Oh, dear. Oh, my.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.964
ADULT ADAM: Mom was right.
Hot plates and dumb
college students do not mix.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.066
Please refer to the pamphlet
on fire evacuation

12:13.133 --> 12:14.667
I provided earlier...

12:14.734 --> 12:16.436
Or just run for your lives!

12:18.638 --> 12:22.209
Make a hole, people!
Make a hole! Make a hole!

12:22.275 --> 12:25.779
Erica Dorothy Goldberg,
you come find your mama!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.415
College is fun.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.217
ADULT ADAM:
While my sister's freshman
year went up in flames,

12:30.283 --> 12:33.120
I had to bring Barry's cool
new girlfriend to life,

12:33.186 --> 12:35.188
or at least make it
seem like that.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.323
Show time.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.457
Let's get weird.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.260
What are my responsibilities
here, again?

12:40.327 --> 12:41.561
I needed bras,

12:41.628 --> 12:42.796
and you're the only guy
I knew who could get them.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.531
Time to hack
into NASA.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.000
ADULT ADAM:
And hack in to NASA we did.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.336
All we needed was my
trusty modem, a little luck,

12:49.402 --> 12:51.471
and my girlfriend
on the other end

12:51.538 --> 12:54.107
pretending to be the most
powerful space agency
in the world.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.109
It's working.
We're making a lady.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.012
ADULT ADAM:
With Barry on board, it was
time for the next phase,

12:59.079 --> 13:00.881
figure out his taste.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.215
ADAM: As you can see,
NASA needs to know

13:02.282 --> 13:04.384
exactly what your
dream-girl looks like.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.353
Again, this is just
between me, you,

13:06.419 --> 13:08.555
the American space program,
and no one else.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.790
That makes me feel safer
about opening up to you.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.225
Sure.
Tell NASA she has to have

13:12.292 --> 13:14.494
Heather Locklear's eyes,
Julia Roberts' smile,

13:14.561 --> 13:17.097
Delta Burke's top stuff,
Bo Derek's hair,

13:17.164 --> 13:18.298
but most important,

13:18.365 --> 13:20.300
Chuck Norris'
sense of justice.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.369
Oy vey.
Time to make that button

13:22.435 --> 13:26.173
and make that closet explode
with lightning and hot ladies.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.209
ADULT ADAM: But, naturally,
Barry's dream woman
didn't exist,

13:29.276 --> 13:30.777
so I had to get
him back on track.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.612
Odd.
It's not working.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.714
What the hell, man?
You promised me a lady.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.417
I already spent a fortune
on candles and erotic oils!

13:37.484 --> 13:39.519
I think the computer
just needs more data,

13:39.586 --> 13:41.821
for example, grounded,
realistic qualities

13:41.889 --> 13:44.691
you could find in women
you'd see in everyday life
or at our school.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.126
Give me that typer!

13:46.193 --> 13:48.161
I'll punch in all the lady
data it can handle.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.731
This list is ridiculous.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.801
How am I supposed
to find a girl who likes
"sensual karate"

13:54.868 --> 13:56.569
and "can kick
a 50-yard field goal"?

13:56.636 --> 13:58.838
Good news is he's looking
for a very specific
kind of gal.

13:58.906 --> 14:01.875
"Ability to communicate
with dolphins
and a savage tan"?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.643
Adam, this list is insane.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.013
Look, this began
with me worrying about
my physical safety,

14:06.079 --> 14:07.915
but now I think Barry
really needs this.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.983
Okay, sure.
I'll try to find someone

14:10.050 --> 14:13.053
with "Morgan Fairchild's
side-butt."

14:13.120 --> 14:14.487
I don't even know
what that is.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.688
I believe in you.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.424
ADULT ADAM: While I put
my faith in Jackie,

14:17.490 --> 14:20.060
my sister was losing faith
that my mom would ever leave.

14:20.127 --> 14:23.563
So, I guess it doesn't matter
if I go on record

14:23.630 --> 14:24.631
and say, "I'm sorry."

14:24.697 --> 14:26.066
No.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.801
I allotted you a very fair
three hours to say goodbye.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.171
Instead, I'm forever known
as the girl who had her mommy

14:31.238 --> 14:33.540
sleep in her dorm
on the first night of school.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.142
Honey, this is college.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.743
There's no judgment here.

14:36.809 --> 14:40.747
(LAUGHS) You let your mom
sleep over on the first night?

14:40.813 --> 14:43.550
Oh, that is very memorable.
(CHUCKLES)

14:43.616 --> 14:44.918
In a negative way.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.186
(LAUGHTER)

14:46.253 --> 14:48.521
That's it.
You are leaving right now,

14:48.588 --> 14:49.923
and never coming back.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.491
The sun's up,
so there are no excuses.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.193
I might have out-stayed
my welcome,

14:53.260 --> 14:56.129
but that's because saying
goodbye is so hard.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.932
No! I'm supposed to be
making life-long friends,

14:58.999 --> 15:00.533
and you took it
away from me

15:00.600 --> 15:02.669
because you refuse
to say goodbye.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.671
Fine.
I'll go.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.107
Right after brunch,
and then we'll spend a few
hours at the Smithsonian,

15:07.174 --> 15:09.943
and then to top it all off,
you have to give Mama
all the kisses.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.878
You can forget about
getting all the kisses.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.313
Not even butterfly?
No!

15:13.380 --> 15:15.915
Surely, Eskimo kisses
are still on the table.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.484
You will never
again experience

15:17.550 --> 15:19.752
the warm nose-love
of our chilly, Native friends.

15:19.819 --> 15:24.057
That is literally
the worst thing a daughter

15:24.124 --> 15:25.892
has ever said to a mother.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.594
(GROANS)

15:27.660 --> 15:29.862
ADULT ADAM:
As Erica swore off
coming home forever,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.065
I swore Jackie and I
had found the perfect girl
for Barry's senior year.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.068
Barry, great news!
I have a girl for you.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.004
Yes!
I knew science was real.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.139
I don't think
that was up for debate.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.907
I meant Jackie
found someone.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.076
You gave her
my lady recipe?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.511
That was for
NASA's eyes only!

15:44.577 --> 15:46.379
I know.
But she found someone

15:46.446 --> 15:48.148
who's got everything
you asked for. Right?

15:48.215 --> 15:50.017
Um, I didn't hit
everything on your list,

15:50.083 --> 15:53.520
but at the top,
you asked for a girl,
and I got that part.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.455
That's not nothing,
mister.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.756
I got goosebumps.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.992
Let's stop talking and bring
out our mystery girl.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.860
Hey! (GIGGLES)

16:00.927 --> 16:03.030
Carla?
Are you insane?

16:03.096 --> 16:04.998
She's a loose cannon,
and not the good kind

16:05.065 --> 16:06.233
like a vigilante cop

16:06.299 --> 16:07.867
who endlessly frustrates
his commissioner.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.503
It's true. The court-appointed
psychiatrist gave up on me.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.205
I didn't even know
you liked me.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.607
I don't. But he dated Lainey,
and she's my rival,

16:14.674 --> 16:16.276
so I'm taking what's hers.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.111
Give me her address so I can
send her photos of us in love.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.314
No. I don't want
this aggressive loony toon
as my special lady.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.450
Well, that's all we got.
Thanks, Adam.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.685
You've officially made
a mockery of our plan

16:25.752 --> 16:27.787
to have a computer
print out a girl for me.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.822
Oh, my God, dude!

16:29.889 --> 16:31.691
Weird Science isn't real!

16:31.758 --> 16:34.361
There will never be
a year of awesome

16:34.427 --> 16:36.363
or girls fighting over you
in a Thunderdome,

16:36.429 --> 16:38.898
and you're not gonna
live with Kathy Ireland!

16:38.965 --> 16:41.101
All you are is Barry!

16:41.801 --> 16:43.336
Believe me. I know.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.004
And I know that movie's
just a movie.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.439
Then why did you...

16:46.506 --> 16:48.208
I just wanted to believe
things would be okay.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.143
That... That...

16:50.210 --> 16:52.279
Lainey wasn't a fluke.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.746
That someone would actually
love me again.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.216
Barry...
No.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.219
You're right.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.054
Looks like I'm back
to being me.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.795
ADULT ADAM: Thanks to me,
Barry had hit rock bottom,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.131
so it was time for me
to get him back on top.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.532
What's this?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.000
I've revised your daily
ass-kicking schedule

17:14.067 --> 17:15.202
for your year of awesome.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.736
Go away.
I don't need your pity.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.072
Before you reject my offer,
I think you'll agree

17:19.139 --> 17:21.208
that I've really jazzed up
your options.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.376
No.
Yes.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.579
You get to pants me in public,
and not just anywhere,

17:26.646 --> 17:29.916
at the first pep rally
of the year.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.018
In front of
the entire school?

17:32.085 --> 17:34.587
That'd be the Holy Grail of
younger-brother humiliation.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.756
Indeed. And I'm offering
it to you wearing this.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.360
Sweat pants?

17:40.427 --> 17:42.729
That's a loose garment
ideal for pantsing.

17:42.795 --> 17:43.830
But it gets better.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.098
ADULT ADAM: It really did.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.666
I then presented Barry
with the ultimate

17:46.733 --> 17:49.102
little-brother sacrifice,
my drawstring.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.803
The uncinched sweats
will be loose

17:50.870 --> 17:52.939
beyond your wildest dreams.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.374
Have you gone mad?

17:54.441 --> 17:56.008
To get you back to your
rightful place on top,

17:56.075 --> 17:57.277
I would rip the drawstring

17:57.344 --> 17:59.546
from every loose-fitting
pant I own.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.815
Wow, you really
are a good brother.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.284
But

18:04.351 --> 18:05.985
none of this changes the fact
that Lainey's gone

18:06.052 --> 18:07.520
and I'll never find
anyone like her.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.589
Listen, Weird Science
might not be real,

18:09.656 --> 18:11.858
but you'll find
your dream girl.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.059
I know it in my heart.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.627
You think?
Of course.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.630
Someone's gonna see
what Lainey saw in you,

18:17.697 --> 18:19.031
what I see in you.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.800
and that's a legend.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.502
Thanks.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.537
I don't know whether
to give you a hug
or a butt hat.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.539
Both sound
very uncomfortable.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.276
Let's start with this.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.943
ADULT ADAM: With that,
I helped Barry realize

18:31.010 --> 18:33.680
that he could still have
an epic senior year,

18:33.746 --> 18:36.048
even if it wasn't
quite what he imagined.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.217
Morning, or whatever.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.486
Same clothes.
Fun night?

18:39.552 --> 18:41.053
From what I hear,
not as fun as the night

18:41.120 --> 18:42.922
you had with your mommy?

18:42.989 --> 18:45.858
So, want to help me
take down all this crap?

18:45.925 --> 18:49.396
ADULT ADAM:
That day, Erica finally
got her new start

18:49.462 --> 18:51.431
by letting go of the past.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.301
But sometimes
that's not so easy.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.835
That's a cute photo.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.704
ERICA: It was the first day
of kindergarten.

18:57.770 --> 19:02.375
I was so scared, and she
stayed with me the whole day.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.711
That's a good mom.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.448
Damn it,
why do I miss her?

19:08.515 --> 19:10.583
Seriously, something's
wrong with me.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.020
I mean, yeah, your folks
are weird and intrusive,

19:14.086 --> 19:15.855
but they were here.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.792
My parents were
too busy to come.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.228
And that's bad?

19:21.294 --> 19:23.363
I didn't think it was until
I saw your mother cared enough

19:23.430 --> 19:25.665
to bring your home right here.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.734
You're lucky.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.436
ADULT ADAM: And,
thanks to Erica,

19:29.502 --> 19:32.605
Erica realized
how fortunate she really was.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.174
"Bad night vision"?
Really?

19:35.242 --> 19:36.643
That is a real thing.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.011
I hear my dad complaining
about it all the time.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.213
Hey.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.614
(GASPS)
My baby's back!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.483
Mom, I'm just
here to say goodbye.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.018
So, you don't hate me?

19:46.085 --> 19:49.656
Look, I know I've been pushing
you away since we got here.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.260
I guess it's just
easier to do that

19:53.326 --> 19:55.862
than actually accept
that this is it.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.765
So, now what?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.500
ADULT ADAM:
And so, after everything,

20:00.567 --> 20:02.702
my mom got exactly
what she wanted.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.437
The idea that leaving
for college

20:04.504 --> 20:07.240
was just as hard for
my sister as it was for her.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.642
And one last kiss
in your palm

20:09.709 --> 20:13.179
for you to ball up
and stick in your heart.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.714
* Just half a chance

20:14.781 --> 20:17.216
* Make sure that
one night you're here

20:17.284 --> 20:19.085
* But next night, you're not

20:19.151 --> 20:21.788
ADULT ADAM:
As for Barry, well,
he realized his senior year

20:21.854 --> 20:25.124
could be a little easier
if he teamed up with me.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.059
Here you go,
little bro.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.428
* Tenderness

20:28.495 --> 20:30.162
* Tenderness

20:30.229 --> 20:31.898
* Tenderness

20:31.964 --> 20:33.800
It's kind of sweet
how you look after
your little brother.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.768
Yeah?

20:35.835 --> 20:38.738
Um, yeah.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.573
Thanks.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.375
ADULT ADAM: In the end,
you'd be surprised

20:42.442 --> 20:45.111
what a little help
from your loved ones
can do for you.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.779
No matter how far away
you are,

20:46.846 --> 20:49.449
you can always keep
a little piece of home

20:49.516 --> 20:51.418
close to your heart.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.953
* Tenderness

21:06.032 --> 21:08.301
Oh, hey, Jackie.
Are you staying for dinner?

21:08.368 --> 21:10.570
I'm making chicken-fried
chicken Parm.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.072
Thanks, but I should
just get going.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.441
BOTH: Eskimo kiss.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.508
Butterfly kiss.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.377
Cheek kiss.
Cheek kiss.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.878
And one last kiss in your palm

21:18.945 --> 21:21.314
so you can ball it up
and stick it in your heart.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.117
I, uh, taught her
all the kisses.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.719
You don't mind, do you?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.056
Oh.
