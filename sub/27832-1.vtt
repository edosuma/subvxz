02:43.790 --> 02:49.462
EVERYBODY KNOWS

02:54.634 --> 02:56.928
POLICE CONFIRM THAT CARMEN WAS...

03:03.977 --> 03:07.647
ONE WEEK MISSING

03:24.831 --> 03:28.751
<i>Look at that! It's stunning!</i>

03:33.047 --> 03:34.132
Hi, Dad!

03:34.674 --> 03:36.217
<i>Hi, honey. I see you've arrived.</i>

03:36.676 --> 03:39.679
Almost. Auntie Ana
picked us up from the airport.

03:40.889 --> 03:42.724
Darling. How are you?

03:45.018 --> 03:46.978
- <i>What time is it there?</i>
- Almost 12 p.m.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.187
Did we wake you?

03:48.271 --> 03:49.814
<i>How was the flight?</i>

03:49.898 --> 03:51.649
We didn't sleep a wink.

03:51.733 --> 03:54.485
- Hi, Alejandro!
- <i>Hi, Ana. How are you?</i>

03:54.569 --> 03:55.653
Great.

03:55.737 --> 03:58.823
It's a shame you couldn't come.
You'll be missed.

03:58.907 --> 04:00.658
<i>Next time. I'm sorry.</i>

04:00.742 --> 04:02.952
That'll be in three years' time.

04:03.036 --> 04:06.164
I'm going to ask them
to spend their honeymoon with us.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.291
We'll take them
on a tour of Argentina.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.668
What a great idea!

04:10.752 --> 04:13.546
<i>Give my best to...
What's the victims name?</i>

04:14.464 --> 04:16.341
He's called Joan.
I will,

04:16.423 --> 04:17.675
thanks.

04:18.718 --> 04:21.012
Dad, did Tutu sleep with you?

04:21.095 --> 04:23.056
<i>I don't know.
I was looking for her.</i>

04:23.598 --> 04:25.016
She doesn't miss me?

04:25.099 --> 04:28.394
<i>Come here, Tutu.
Come talk to your mistress.</i>

04:28.478 --> 04:30.521
- <i>And your brother?</i>
- Talk to Dad.

04:30.605 --> 04:31.814
Hi, Dad!

04:31.898 --> 04:33.983
<i>Hi, lazybones.
How are you?</i>

04:34.067 --> 04:35.568
Good. Hi, Tutu.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.530
My darling, I miss you.

04:39.614 --> 04:41.282
Send me a kiss!

05:02.136 --> 05:03.137
Paco!

05:17.777 --> 05:20.071
Don't mix these
with the others, please.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.240
Keep them apart.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.716
- Very Pretty.
- Really?

05:39.799 --> 05:42.635
- It's a bit tight.
- Let me see...

05:42.719 --> 05:44.470
You've put on a little weight.

05:44.554 --> 05:46.889
- Really?
- I prefer you that way.

05:46.973 --> 05:48.975
- I'm happy.
- About putting on weight?

05:50.018 --> 05:51.769
That you've got your eye on me.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.563
Shall I help you?

05:53.646 --> 05:55.189
It's stuck.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.817
Like this?

06:04.073 --> 06:05.491
You'll tear it.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.702
I'll try from inside then.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.164
You look really pretty.

06:26.846 --> 06:28.014
How are you?

06:38.566 --> 06:40.359
I want to do that!

06:55.708 --> 06:56.834
Laura!

06:58.127 --> 06:59.378
Rocío!

07:00.880 --> 07:03.382
Mom, your sister's here!

07:05.885 --> 07:07.512
Say hi to your cousin.

07:13.935 --> 07:14.936
Diego!

07:17.230 --> 07:18.898
Where are you off to all alone?

07:21.442 --> 07:22.735
Say hi to your aunt.

07:26.114 --> 07:28.032
Will we all fit in this hotel?

07:28.116 --> 07:30.535
We've also rented a house nearby.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.663
We're too tired
to work out where we sleep.

07:33.746 --> 07:36.833
For two nights, who cares?
I don't mind.

07:36.916 --> 07:39.377
You decide. I'll be right back.

07:45.675 --> 07:46.884
Hi, my love.

07:47.844 --> 07:51.556
This is Joan. My sister Laura.
Diego and Irene.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.724
Much cuter than in the photos.

07:53.808 --> 07:56.602
Pleased to meet you.
Ana's told me lots about you.

07:56.686 --> 07:58.396
Same here.

08:01.858 --> 08:03.693
Is that everything?

08:03.776 --> 08:04.861
Let's go.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.613
Much better.
Nothing like the last guy.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.251
Dad!

08:20.835 --> 08:24.463
- Where shall we put all this?
- I've prepared your rooms upstairs.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.924
Where's Dad?

08:27.008 --> 08:28.328
I don't know,
check the courtyard.

08:45.193 --> 08:46.527
So handsome.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.616
Looking good.

08:58.915 --> 09:00.333
My sister!

09:06.255 --> 09:08.049
I really missed you.

09:17.058 --> 09:19.143
Dad has aged suddenly.

09:19.227 --> 09:21.145
Yes, since you last saw him...

09:21.229 --> 09:22.647
He's old.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.732
Everyone sees that except him.

09:25.858 --> 09:26.859
Kids...

09:27.568 --> 09:29.862
Get changed, Granddad's waiting.

09:31.364 --> 09:32.365
Give me that.

10:06.565 --> 10:07.942
Not so fast.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.902
Don't be scared!

10:19.078 --> 10:20.121
Tie it back for me.

10:36.762 --> 10:37.763
Brake!

10:38.806 --> 10:40.099
Who are these morons?

10:43.311 --> 10:44.770
Wasn't that your nephew
on the back?

10:44.854 --> 10:47.523
Who's driving?

10:47.606 --> 10:48.649
I don't know.

10:52.153 --> 10:56.407
<i>My wife brought me here to tell you
about wine. Who likes wine?</i>

10:56.490 --> 10:57.783
This...

10:58.492 --> 11:00.453
is...

11:00.995 --> 11:02.079
the grape must.

11:02.163 --> 11:03.789
The difference between this...

11:05.333 --> 11:06.500
and this...

11:08.836 --> 11:09.837
is...

11:10.838 --> 11:11.922
time.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.634
Nice story,
but when do we drink it?

11:17.011 --> 11:18.012
Drink it?

11:18.304 --> 11:20.097
If your teacher lets you...

11:20.181 --> 11:22.433
Are you for real?
No way!

11:22.516 --> 11:25.478
Time gives the wine character

11:26.562 --> 11:29.273
and personality.
Alright?

11:30.232 --> 11:31.359
I'll be right back.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.111
This wine I've brought
from the estate

11:34.195 --> 11:35.488
is really good.

11:36.072 --> 11:39.325
Now the teacher's gone,
who wants to try the wine?

11:40.201 --> 11:41.827
- It's cool.
- Isn't it?

11:42.411 --> 11:43.871
It looks good.

11:45.164 --> 11:47.958
- So it's these three?
- Yes, Abel, Matias and Marco.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.836
- You'll come with them?
- Of course, don't worry.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.966
Listen, I promised the bride
you'd work like pros.

11:56.050 --> 11:57.676
Even better.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.641
He said he'd come.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.935
Something came up at work

12:06.018 --> 12:08.104
and he had to stay.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.522
Work can wait.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.440
His work isn't like ours.

12:11.524 --> 12:14.985
- I'm sure he's very busy.
- You're very busy too.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.155
With our ups and downs.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.866
We make just enough
to pay off the loan.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.619
That's normal
when you're starting out.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.996
Starting out?
It's been two years.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.668
It's better than bickering
at home.

12:31.127 --> 12:32.503
Now we bicker here.

12:34.505 --> 12:35.506
Already?

12:36.382 --> 12:38.676
You're done?
What did I say?

12:38.759 --> 12:40.052
Leave me alone.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.513
Leave her alone?

12:42.596 --> 12:45.057
Lord have mercy!
Cut it out for once.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.897
What a beauty.

12:54.108 --> 12:55.359
She looks like you.

12:55.443 --> 12:58.070
With her eyes open
she looks more like her dad.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.906
How is Gabriel?

13:01.740 --> 13:02.867
He went to Germany.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.871
- To look for work.
- What about you?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.543
We're splitting up.

13:14.462 --> 13:15.713
I didn't know.

13:16.589 --> 13:17.882
Why?

13:19.091 --> 13:20.885
We weren't in a good place

13:20.968 --> 13:23.095
and my parents...

13:23.179 --> 13:24.889
didn't like him much.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.265
What about the little one?

13:28.309 --> 13:29.602
She stays with me.

13:31.145 --> 13:32.146
Honey...

13:35.608 --> 13:36.901
I'm sorry.

13:53.626 --> 13:54.627
Paco!

13:59.298 --> 14:01.967
Each time you come
you have a new kid!

14:02.051 --> 14:03.928
See how well they turn out?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.262
How are you?

14:09.016 --> 14:12.144
What a cutie...

14:12.228 --> 14:13.479
Give him a kiss.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.106
She doesn't want to.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.233
I don't want to.

14:17.816 --> 14:18.984
Let me see...

14:22.196 --> 14:23.447
You gave me a kiss!

14:23.531 --> 14:24.782
A kiss!

14:24.865 --> 14:26.492
That's sweet. Thank you.

14:27.201 --> 14:28.911
So pretty,
she looks just like you.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.412
No, she takes after her father.

14:30.496 --> 14:32.122
Alejandro? Are you joking?

14:32.581 --> 14:34.333
Who said she was Alejandro's?

14:36.835 --> 14:38.629
She's Rocío and Gabriel's daughter!

14:42.174 --> 14:43.342
Son of a bitch!

14:44.718 --> 14:45.970
A bird crapped on him!

14:46.053 --> 14:48.222
You bitch! You scumbag!

14:58.399 --> 14:59.400
Irene!

15:00.442 --> 15:02.528
I'm going. See you later.

15:04.405 --> 15:06.198
Is that your daughter?

15:18.085 --> 15:19.795
What are you doing?

15:19.878 --> 15:21.463
What's going on?

15:21.547 --> 15:24.633
Felipe, you're brave to ride
with this crazy girl.

15:24.717 --> 15:27.678
Brave?
Boys are chickens.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.013
Come here, chickie.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.264
Where are your helmets?

15:31.265 --> 15:35.060
"Chickens"? Tell her
what I used to do at her age.

15:35.144 --> 15:36.145
Just about everything.

15:37.438 --> 15:39.398
See that church roof?

15:39.481 --> 15:42.359
Paco used to climb up there
when he was your age.

15:42.443 --> 15:45.904
He was such a pain
the storks stayed away for years.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.407
That's why they crap on me.

15:49.450 --> 15:50.701
Gross!

15:51.577 --> 15:52.745
Stop it!

15:56.081 --> 15:57.374
See how pretty she is?

15:57.458 --> 15:58.917
So pretty and so grown up.

16:00.336 --> 16:02.379
She just needs
to behave a little better.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.011
Here and here.

16:09.094 --> 16:12.264
- It'll be ready tomorrow?
- You can't go to the wedding naked.

16:12.765 --> 16:13.766
Hello.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.018
Hi, son.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.728
Does your mom know
about the bike?

16:19.772 --> 16:21.106
Goddamn bike.

16:22.358 --> 16:24.943
All those people
who just arrived,

16:25.027 --> 16:26.945
are they wedding guests?

16:27.029 --> 16:29.406
A Catalan husband,
an Argentinean husband...

16:29.490 --> 16:31.450
Ana hit the jackpot, like Laura.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.120
Good job.
If they'd stayed here,

16:35.204 --> 16:38.749
they'd be like Mariana
with poor old Fernando.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.835
Has Paco seen the dress?

16:42.628 --> 16:44.129
He loved it.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.090
The dress or what's under it?

17:00.229 --> 17:01.605
That'll do.

17:01.689 --> 17:03.482
- Your daughter...
- Enough!

17:04.525 --> 17:05.943
Dad.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.611
A little more at the back.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.113
It's your daughter's wedding.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.573
Can't you lighten up a bit?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.032
Who asked you?

17:16.704 --> 17:18.955
What I have to put up with...

17:19.039 --> 17:20.040
So pig-headed!

17:31.093 --> 17:32.469
What the hell, man?

17:35.848 --> 17:38.183
We're unemployed
and they steal our jobs.

17:38.267 --> 17:42.354
Come on, I can't see you
picking grapes under a blazing sun.

17:42.438 --> 17:44.481
I was working the land

17:44.565 --> 17:47.443
when you were just a kid
chasing girls.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.028
Don't lecture me.

17:58.579 --> 17:59.580
Vicente!

18:55.469 --> 18:57.763
In the name of the Father,
the Son

18:57.846 --> 18:59.139
and the Holy Spirit.

19:00.349 --> 19:02.601
May the Lord be with you.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.234
Dear brethren,
we're gathered here

19:10.317 --> 19:13.445
for God to safeguard with His grace

19:13.529 --> 19:15.739
your intention to enter into marriage

19:15.823 --> 19:17.699
before
the minister of the Church

19:17.783 --> 19:20.369
and the Christian community.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.484
It's a great view from here.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.697
Stop! Are you crazy?

19:58.699 --> 20:00.450
Why are you such a sissy?

20:14.673 --> 20:16.758
Do you know who they are?

20:16.842 --> 20:18.969
- They're probably dead.
- No.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.679
How can you be so sure?

20:20.762 --> 20:22.639
I'm not, I'm guessing.

20:23.891 --> 20:24.892
Do I know them?

20:26.351 --> 20:27.352
Your mother.

20:28.687 --> 20:29.688
And the "P"?

20:29.771 --> 20:30.814
For Paco.

20:31.982 --> 20:32.983
Seriously?

20:33.066 --> 20:34.902
Everybody knows.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.153
What?

20:36.236 --> 20:38.155
They were in love.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.538
- And your initial?
- I haven't put it up.

20:46.622 --> 20:47.831
Go on.

20:50.042 --> 20:51.710
I'll do it for you.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.547
No.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.342
Don't you dare!

21:07.476 --> 21:09.061
Go on, write it.

21:11.939 --> 21:13.190
Go on.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.983
But you'll leave again.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.068
Come with me.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.028
- To Argentina?
- Yes.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.197
- My mom wouldn't let me.
- Your mom?

21:20.948 --> 21:23.533
Pack your bag in secret and leave.

21:23.617 --> 21:24.618
Go on.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.146
You're crazy!

22:01.697 --> 22:06.118
The church clock and the bell tower
are falling into ruin.

22:06.201 --> 22:11.248
But we must wait for help
to fund the repairs.

22:12.124 --> 22:16.420
It's such a shame that Laura's
husband couldn't come with her.

22:18.338 --> 22:21.758
We must be grateful
for his help with the facade.

22:21.842 --> 22:25.595
If he'd seen the bell tower,
I'm sure he would have helped us.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.097
As for the parishioners...

22:27.180 --> 22:29.891
He never misses a chance to beg.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.060
You should look after the church,

22:32.144 --> 22:33.645
it belongs to you.

22:36.982 --> 22:38.734
By the way,
when you throw the rice

22:38.817 --> 22:42.279
at the newlyweds,
wait until you're outside...

26:06.441 --> 26:07.525
Go on.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.367
Take it.

26:18.119 --> 26:19.204
Here, let's toast.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.570
- How are you doing?
- Good.

26:54.781 --> 26:55.782
Teeth.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.076
Not tonight, please.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.578
Okay. Wash your hands.

27:30.525 --> 27:31.943
Honey, come here.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.403
Are you alright?

27:34.112 --> 27:35.905
She got dizzy from dancing.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.533
You were fine. What's wrong?

27:38.616 --> 27:39.617
I'm sleepy.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.704
It's jet lag, she's exhausted.
Let's get you to bed.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.671
Take those upstairs for me.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.132
- Shall I help you?
- No need.

27:54.341 --> 27:55.467
You've drunk too much.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.969
Go away! Leave me alone.

27:58.178 --> 28:00.847
What a grumpy granddad!

28:15.362 --> 28:17.781
This damn thing...

28:32.170 --> 28:33.171
Feeling better?

28:56.778 --> 28:57.779
Mariana.

28:59.406 --> 29:00.532
It's me, Dad.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.826
I want to get down.
Call Mariana.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.661
- I'll help you.
- No. Get her...

29:05.286 --> 29:06.746
Why does it matter?

29:07.038 --> 29:08.039
Get her.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.333
- You can't do it.
- Okay, I'll call her.

29:21.511 --> 29:22.512
Mariana!

29:24.764 --> 29:26.933
Dad's waiting for you on the stairs.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.103
When's the power coming back?

29:34.941 --> 29:39.112
Do you have
any idea what time?

29:40.613 --> 29:43.450
It's the whole town.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.078
Is it raining?

29:47.787 --> 29:48.788
No.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.417
- A few drops.
- Just a few drops.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.377
More than that.

29:55.670 --> 29:58.923
Try to fix it if you can.

29:59.257 --> 30:00.341
Make an effort.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.093
Thanks a lot.

30:02.635 --> 30:03.720
What are they saying?

30:04.179 --> 30:05.180
It's raining.

30:09.184 --> 30:10.185
Vicente!

30:12.479 --> 30:14.147
- Open up. It's Paco.
- Coming!

30:14.772 --> 30:17.150
Get a move on,
people are waiting.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.404
- What's wrong?
- I need a favor.

30:21.654 --> 30:25.116
Get me a couple of guys...
Relax, it's not that late.

30:25.450 --> 30:29.162
We must go to the estate
to get a generator.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.164
- Now?
- Yes. Hurry.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.499
Thanks.

30:36.294 --> 30:38.796
It doesn't matter.

32:04.632 --> 32:05.633
Irene.

32:08.636 --> 32:09.846
Are you in there?

32:19.939 --> 32:20.940
Wing wing!

32:21.316 --> 32:22.317
Wing wing!

32:22.609 --> 32:24.193
Paco, come here.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.864
A turkey's phone goes wing wing!

32:34.120 --> 32:35.121
She's not here?

32:37.457 --> 32:38.583
Where is she?

32:40.585 --> 32:42.253
Why was the door locked?

32:46.090 --> 32:47.091
Irene!

33:09.447 --> 33:10.657
What's wrong?

33:11.949 --> 33:13.785
Stay with the boy,
I'll be right back.

33:30.677 --> 33:33.930
Police confirm
that Carmen was kidnapped.

33:45.525 --> 33:47.026
Have you seen Irene?

33:47.568 --> 33:48.778
Didn't she go to bed?

33:49.028 --> 33:50.613
Nobody's seen her since?

34:04.335 --> 34:06.838
Darling, I don't know where you are.

34:07.547 --> 34:10.007
If this is a joke,
you're really hurting me.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.342
Call me back.
Straight away.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.346
She must be having fun somewhere.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.849
Go see Laura and stay with her.

34:18.558 --> 34:19.559
Paco!

35:12.111 --> 35:13.404
We have your daughter.

35:13.613 --> 35:15.907
If the police find out,
we'll kill her.

35:21.829 --> 35:22.830
Felipe!

35:23.414 --> 35:24.415
Come here!

35:26.584 --> 35:28.085
Have you seen Irene?

35:29.128 --> 35:30.880
No. What's wrong?

35:34.300 --> 35:36.302
All I know is
she wasn't feeling well.

35:37.762 --> 35:39.388
- Were you smoking?
- No.

35:39.639 --> 35:41.474
- Tell me the truth.
- It's true.

35:42.475 --> 35:44.602
Go have a look for her.

35:45.478 --> 35:47.146
I said go look for her!

35:56.948 --> 35:57.949
What is it?

35:58.658 --> 35:59.659
It's a joke.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.347
Laura got this message.

36:21.639 --> 36:24.475
Could this be
Irene's idea of a joke?

36:24.684 --> 36:26.435
- When did this come?
- Just now.

36:26.686 --> 36:29.647
- Did you call the number?
- Yes, it doesn't exist.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.484
Where are you going?

36:33.734 --> 36:36.153
If they've really taken her,
they can't be far.

36:36.571 --> 36:37.780
I'm coming with you.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.788
What's happening?

37:41.761 --> 37:43.429
I let him drive.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.056
I'm a bit wasted.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.224
Off you go.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.727
Be careful, please.

37:58.903 --> 37:59.946
What's wrong?

38:00.237 --> 38:03.240
A cable's been cut,
but we're fixing it. Don't stop.

38:05.576 --> 38:06.577
Damn.

38:20.174 --> 38:21.175
Where now?

38:22.093 --> 38:23.719
We won't catch up with them.

38:24.637 --> 38:26.138
Should we call the police?

38:27.598 --> 38:30.142
Do something! I beg you!

38:32.019 --> 38:36.148
I don't want to scare you,
but the clippings you saw on the bed

38:36.482 --> 38:38.275
could be

38:38.526 --> 38:40.945
from the people
who kidnapped that girl.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.615
Why was she kidnapped?

38:45.032 --> 38:46.033
For money.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.493
What did they do to her?

38:48.494 --> 38:49.912
It might not be them.

38:51.664 --> 38:54.750
The thing is, they threatened...

38:59.547 --> 39:02.133
to kill the girl
if the police were told.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.969
That's why
we must be very careful...

39:05.928 --> 39:06.929
Did they kill her?

39:08.806 --> 39:09.807
Did they kill her?

39:57.897 --> 40:00.399
Are you going to sit around
all night doing nothing?

40:11.077 --> 40:13.370
Who saw her last?

40:14.246 --> 40:16.499
Felipe was with her all night.
Ask him.

40:16.916 --> 40:18.501
Felipe knows nothing

40:18.751 --> 40:21.045
except that she was tired...

40:21.295 --> 40:23.214
and she went off to sleep.

40:25.132 --> 40:26.717
In fact, she was fine, and then

40:27.259 --> 40:29.095
she had a drink

40:29.720 --> 40:30.721
and suddenly...

40:31.972 --> 40:34.016
What if her drink was spiked?

40:34.100 --> 40:35.101
With what?

40:36.310 --> 40:37.394
A sleeping pill perhaps.

40:38.229 --> 40:41.023
One of the guests
must have been an accomplice.

40:41.649 --> 40:45.277
The electric cable was cut
while she was upstairs alone.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.240
We should call the police.

40:50.616 --> 40:51.742
Laura, please.

40:52.159 --> 40:55.412
No way.
I don't want them to hurt her.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.631
Let's think.

41:07.007 --> 41:08.759
What else can we do?

41:09.135 --> 41:10.495
Who has the video
of the reception?

41:11.470 --> 41:13.055
- Who has it?
- The video?

41:13.305 --> 41:14.723
The lads from the center.

41:15.641 --> 41:18.102
Whose idea was it
to invite delinquents to a wedding?

41:19.103 --> 41:20.104
Bea knows them.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.107
We must call them
and see the video now.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.442
- At 4:30 a.m.?
- I don't care.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.821
Did Bea tell you they were
the ones who would film it?

41:29.155 --> 41:31.115
She suggested it and I said yes.

41:31.949 --> 41:33.409
Why them?

41:33.993 --> 41:35.313
They wouldn't be capable of this.

41:35.661 --> 41:36.662
Paco.

41:38.789 --> 41:40.332
What's happened?

41:40.666 --> 41:41.917
We don't know anything yet.

41:50.676 --> 41:51.677
Felipe...

41:53.512 --> 41:55.973
Did she say anything strange
to you today?

41:56.182 --> 41:57.183
Like what?

41:58.017 --> 42:00.978
Like she wanted to mess with us.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.062
No.

42:03.647 --> 42:05.649
You didn't see anyone suspicious?

42:07.359 --> 42:08.360
No.

42:08.444 --> 42:09.653
And the fruit pickers?

42:12.364 --> 42:13.365
Just one thing...

42:14.241 --> 42:16.285
We fell off the bike on the road.

42:16.869 --> 42:18.954
We couldn't start it up again.

42:19.205 --> 42:22.041
The fruit pickers came by
and helped us fix it.

42:22.541 --> 42:23.709
When did this happen?

42:24.501 --> 42:25.502
Yesterday.

42:32.092 --> 42:34.678
Look, this wasn't improvised.

42:35.596 --> 42:38.974
Whoever did this knew
that Laura and the kids were coming

42:39.683 --> 42:42.353
and they organized this.

42:48.025 --> 42:51.070
They organized
the newspaper clippings,

42:51.570 --> 42:53.697
they cut the power on the highway,

42:54.031 --> 42:57.534
and entered the house unnoticed.

42:58.077 --> 42:59.578
They're professionals.

42:59.870 --> 43:02.070
Someone went upstairs
and left the clippings on the bed.

43:02.957 --> 43:05.000
Maybe a stranger got into the house.

43:06.252 --> 43:07.670
Maybe it wasn't a stranger.

43:30.234 --> 43:31.902
You should rest, Laura.

43:35.489 --> 43:36.573
Leave that.

43:38.325 --> 43:40.286
Did you know about this girl?

43:43.956 --> 43:45.207
It was years ago.

43:46.333 --> 43:47.710
Around here?

43:49.795 --> 43:50.879
Not far away.

43:52.506 --> 43:53.507
Get some rest.

44:45.225 --> 44:47.978
Let the parents decide
whether to alert the police.

44:48.187 --> 44:50.105
I'm terrified for the girl.

44:50.356 --> 44:52.274
Her mom must be even more terrified.

44:52.524 --> 44:54.193
So I shouldn't help them?

44:54.568 --> 44:58.322
You don't even know
if it will help or hurt her.

44:58.697 --> 44:59.990
Leave it up to them.

45:00.574 --> 45:02.034
What if it's those kids of yours?

45:02.534 --> 45:04.328
Why would it be them?

45:13.253 --> 45:14.713
Let's go home. I'm beat.

45:15.005 --> 45:16.298
Call your colleague again.

45:16.882 --> 45:18.175
Her cell's switched off.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.511
She'll call me when she wakes up.

45:20.719 --> 45:22.304
We have to see that video now.

45:22.554 --> 45:24.056
Her door is locked.
What can I do?

45:24.348 --> 45:25.349
Open the fucking door!

45:26.058 --> 45:27.518
Shall I open it?

45:31.897 --> 45:33.857
We woke you up, I'm sorry.

45:34.191 --> 45:36.652
Never mind.
Is there a problem?

45:37.111 --> 45:38.362
No, it's fine.

45:39.238 --> 45:40.656
Looking for something?

45:40.906 --> 45:42.574
I just wanted to find out

45:43.075 --> 45:44.910
if any of these three kids

45:45.869 --> 45:48.247
has a record. Marcos, Abel...

45:48.580 --> 45:51.041
They all have minor charges:

45:51.542 --> 45:53.669
a little dealing, petty theft...

45:56.797 --> 45:59.675
Turn off the lights
and shut the door, please.

46:01.135 --> 46:02.928
And not a word to the kids.
Okay?

46:28.787 --> 46:30.747
I'm sorry to leave you like this.

46:31.165 --> 46:32.166
Take care.

46:33.625 --> 46:35.794
I'm sure you'll have
good news soon.

46:36.462 --> 46:38.922
Mom and Rocío
will keep us informed.

46:41.967 --> 46:43.635
Come back soon.

46:47.806 --> 46:48.807
Stay strong.

46:55.939 --> 46:57.733
You haven't told Alejandro yet?

46:58.817 --> 47:00.110
You have to tell him.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.945
What can he do from there?

47:02.488 --> 47:05.449
You have to decide
whether to call the police or not.

47:06.033 --> 47:08.410
You must decide that together.

47:08.702 --> 47:09.703
Ana.

47:12.706 --> 47:13.707
Hello Laura.

47:14.041 --> 47:15.042
Hi.

47:17.336 --> 47:18.837
My family wants to say goodbye.

47:26.178 --> 47:27.179
Irene.

47:42.027 --> 47:43.362
Irene, honey.

48:32.703 --> 48:33.745
Hello, my love.

48:35.205 --> 48:37.040
Aren't we going to have breakfast?

48:37.291 --> 48:39.751
Go eat with your auntie.
I'll be right there.

48:44.381 --> 48:45.424
Hello.

48:48.635 --> 48:49.636
Laura?

49:03.442 --> 49:05.736
Call Alejandro, tell him
to come as soon as possible.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.863
Please.

49:08.155 --> 49:10.741
He won't be able to handle it.

49:13.744 --> 49:15.245
How do I tell him?

49:16.413 --> 49:19.541
You have to call him
and talk to him.

49:20.250 --> 49:22.085
Tell him about the threat

49:22.294 --> 49:23.712
if you talk to the police.

49:30.802 --> 49:31.803
Paco...

49:33.096 --> 49:34.097
Don't go.

49:34.306 --> 49:35.849
I'm right here.

49:47.819 --> 49:48.820
<i>Hello?</i>

49:52.991 --> 49:54.231
<i>Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

49:56.453 --> 49:57.454
Irene.

49:58.789 --> 50:01.124
Something happened to her
last night.

50:02.334 --> 50:04.127
What happened to Irene?

50:04.544 --> 50:08.256
<i>What's going on? My God.
Where are you, Laura?</i>

50:09.466 --> 50:12.427
<i>Please, don't cry.
Tell me where you are.</i>

50:32.823 --> 50:34.866
With so many kids at the wedding,

50:35.158 --> 50:37.119
why did they have
to take my daughter?

50:38.870 --> 50:40.038
She was the only one

50:40.330 --> 50:42.207
whose father could pay the ransom.

50:43.834 --> 50:46.878
Where did they get
such a stupid idea?

50:47.921 --> 50:49.005
Why stupid?

50:49.548 --> 50:50.841
Because it's not true.

50:51.591 --> 50:54.803
You always told us
that you were doing well.

50:56.221 --> 50:59.307
With the sum he paid
for the church renovations,

50:59.683 --> 51:01.518
of course people think that.

51:02.227 --> 51:04.229
He hasn't worked for two years.

51:05.522 --> 51:06.523
Mom.

51:08.734 --> 51:11.361
What's wrong, Mom?
Why are you crying?

51:11.737 --> 51:12.738
It's alright, sweetie.

51:13.739 --> 51:15.240
Where's Irene?

51:16.742 --> 51:19.536
Come on,
let's get you some breakfast.

51:23.415 --> 51:24.708
He wants to speak to you.

51:29.921 --> 51:32.257
<i>How can this be?
Why didn't you tell me before?</i>

51:32.632 --> 51:35.343
Because I didn't believe it,
I still don't.

51:35.802 --> 51:37.429
<i>Does she have her medicines?</i>

51:37.721 --> 51:39.514
Come quickly, please.

51:39.931 --> 51:40.932
Come.

52:13.381 --> 52:14.382
What is it?

52:14.591 --> 52:16.259
You know these guys well, right?

52:16.802 --> 52:17.803
Of course.

52:18.345 --> 52:19.429
Is there a problem?

52:37.823 --> 52:39.908
- What's wrong?
- Look.

52:44.079 --> 52:45.080
Fuck.

52:49.709 --> 52:51.253
When did you get this?

52:51.670 --> 52:54.130
- When did you get it?
- A few minutes ago.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.633
300,000 euros!

52:58.134 --> 53:00.136
Do those kids have your number?

53:00.387 --> 53:02.472
Everyone at the center has it.

53:03.348 --> 53:05.851
If it was them,
they wouldn't have written to me.

53:06.142 --> 53:07.978
- Why was it sent to you?
- I don't know.

53:10.188 --> 53:12.482
You're getting too involved in this.

53:12.691 --> 53:13.692
What?

53:14.693 --> 53:16.444
You're getting too involved.

53:16.695 --> 53:17.779
That's not the problem.

53:18.029 --> 53:21.283
No, it's that they wrote to me
instead of the mother.

53:21.533 --> 53:22.534
The problem...

53:23.493 --> 53:25.704
is you bringing those kids
to the wedding.

53:26.079 --> 53:27.163
That's the problem?

53:27.372 --> 53:30.500
If you're so sure,
why don't you just call the police?

53:34.212 --> 53:36.006
Did they give you
the rest of the video?

53:37.591 --> 53:38.592
Yes.

53:50.604 --> 53:51.897
Laura, how are you?

53:52.939 --> 53:54.357
Listen,

53:54.900 --> 53:56.234
We got a message.

53:56.693 --> 53:57.861
A few minutes ago.

53:58.194 --> 53:59.195
Really?

53:59.738 --> 54:00.739
What does it say?

54:02.949 --> 54:05.035
It's the same message Bea got.

54:08.121 --> 54:09.414
Send it to me.

54:11.207 --> 54:12.208
Okay.

54:14.210 --> 54:16.212
I'm coming. Right away.

54:17.047 --> 54:18.256
She got the same message?

54:19.090 --> 54:20.091
Yes.

54:40.111 --> 54:42.072
40 years saying the same shit!

54:42.447 --> 54:43.907
Aren't you sick of it?

54:44.783 --> 54:46.409
You can all go to hell!

54:46.618 --> 54:48.286
Especially you, you old tramp!

54:49.120 --> 54:50.789
Call the police.

54:53.083 --> 54:54.918
Shut up, you loser!

54:56.252 --> 54:57.754
You good-for-nothing!

54:58.505 --> 55:00.548
You all owe me money!

55:01.424 --> 55:02.425
Get the fuck out!

55:02.509 --> 55:04.260
It belongs to me!

55:06.304 --> 55:08.264
That land belongs to me!

55:09.599 --> 55:12.894
You lost your land playing poker!

55:13.144 --> 55:14.145
You drunk!

55:19.651 --> 55:21.611
Watch what you're doing!

55:22.278 --> 55:23.613
What are you saying?

55:26.324 --> 55:27.742
Bunch of tramps!

55:27.993 --> 55:28.994
We're going home.

55:30.954 --> 55:31.955
Leave me alone!

55:32.038 --> 55:33.039
Scum!

55:33.999 --> 55:35.000
Get off me!

55:35.333 --> 55:36.334
We're going home!

55:36.543 --> 55:37.585
Take it easy.

55:37.669 --> 55:39.963
You'll give me back all my land!

55:40.213 --> 55:41.464
What's bugging him?

55:41.673 --> 55:43.425
They said he'd calmed down.

55:43.675 --> 55:45.427
Why is he messing with us now?

55:45.677 --> 55:47.929
Claiming his land
after 30 years?

55:50.682 --> 55:53.476
Why let him drink?
You know what he's like!

55:53.852 --> 55:55.937
Drink or no drink,
he's the same!

55:56.354 --> 55:59.024
Until the police take action...

55:59.315 --> 56:02.652
He's been saying this crap for years,
to me in particular.

56:03.862 --> 56:05.697
Why are you all so wound up?

56:05.989 --> 56:07.657
It's nothing. He's drunk.

56:08.033 --> 56:09.534
That's all.

56:09.868 --> 56:10.952
Everything's fine.

56:12.704 --> 56:13.830
I'll remember this.

56:22.672 --> 56:26.217
Do you have to drink
and bring shame on us?

56:28.053 --> 56:30.680
You may not care what they say,
but I do!

56:30.930 --> 56:34.350
They all worked for me.
Where would they be without me?

56:34.559 --> 56:36.686
Why do you have
to bring this up now?

56:36.936 --> 56:40.148
Because we need that money
to save my granddaughter's life.

56:40.398 --> 56:41.399
Really?

56:41.900 --> 56:43.860
You're the one
who gambled all your land away!

56:43.985 --> 56:44.986
That's enough!

56:45.111 --> 56:46.112
This is not the time.

56:46.362 --> 56:49.574
For Irene's sake,
we must avoid these scenes in town.

56:49.866 --> 56:51.701
You're telling me what to do?

56:51.910 --> 56:52.911
Come on.

56:54.079 --> 56:55.872
Don't forget where you come from.

56:56.706 --> 56:58.041
This isn't your house.

56:58.249 --> 57:01.836
You walk around here
like you're part of the family.

57:02.462 --> 57:05.381
Make no mistake,
you're the servants' son.

57:05.924 --> 57:07.217
Antonio, enough!

57:07.467 --> 57:08.468
Let me speak!

57:09.636 --> 57:12.889
Anyone who doesn't like it
can block their ears.

57:13.306 --> 57:14.307
You owe me

57:14.641 --> 57:16.768
even more
than all those people in town.

57:17.268 --> 57:20.396
You boast about your estate:
"My estate," you say.

57:20.772 --> 57:24.234
You owe "your" estate to me.

57:26.778 --> 57:28.238
You forced Laura...

57:28.446 --> 57:29.781
Let me speak!

57:30.490 --> 57:31.908
You forced my daughter

57:32.951 --> 57:34.661
to give you that land.

57:38.164 --> 57:39.165
Paco.

57:40.625 --> 57:43.253
Did I force you to sell that land?

57:43.920 --> 57:46.256
- What?
- Did I force you to sell your land?

57:52.095 --> 57:53.721
Why are you talking about that now?

57:54.639 --> 57:56.891
I bought it to help her.

57:56.975 --> 57:57.976
You did?

57:58.059 --> 57:59.060
Yes.

57:59.144 --> 58:00.395
At a price that suited you.

58:09.612 --> 58:11.281
Nobody tricked me.

58:11.990 --> 58:14.576
Alejandro and I needed the money.

58:14.826 --> 58:16.119
Paco didn't have enough.

58:16.369 --> 58:19.789
I told him to give me
what he had for the land.

58:23.793 --> 58:25.461
Ignore him,
you know what he's like!

58:25.712 --> 58:27.172
This is for Laura,
she must call me.

58:27.463 --> 58:29.841
First, I'll take you
to see someone.

58:30.049 --> 58:31.050
Who?

58:31.134 --> 58:32.135
I'll tell you later.

59:07.378 --> 59:09.047
Can I keep the video
for a closer look?

59:09.339 --> 59:10.465
Is that a problem?

59:10.882 --> 59:11.883
No.

59:15.386 --> 59:17.680
Let's see those messages.

59:22.268 --> 59:23.978
Can you locate them
from the number?

59:26.272 --> 59:28.858
Generally, it's easy
to trace the sender,

59:29.067 --> 59:30.693
but they're good at hiding.

59:36.241 --> 59:39.327
They buy various SIM cards
using fake IDs.

59:39.619 --> 59:41.371
They send the messages

59:41.913 --> 59:43.039
from old phones

59:43.289 --> 59:46.334
that they destroy, with the card,
after each message.

59:48.253 --> 59:51.256
But you should show
the messages to the police.

59:51.756 --> 59:55.009
We haven't decided yet
if we'll go to the police.

59:56.761 --> 01:00:00.556
Like it or not, when the police
hear of the disappearance,

01:00:00.974 --> 01:00:02.058
they will intervene.

01:00:02.934 --> 01:00:04.727
What should we do?

01:00:04.936 --> 01:00:07.230
Pretend that you're getting

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.065
the ransom money.

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:10.525
How?

01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:12.944
By asking those close to you.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.740
It's not easy to find someone
willing to give so much.

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.410
They must know
that you're looking for money.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:22.412
That will buy you time.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.747
How will they know?

01:00:25.123 --> 01:00:26.457
They're watching you, somehow.

01:00:26.749 --> 01:00:29.085
You can be sure of that.

01:00:36.509 --> 01:00:38.761
Don't tell anyone
about this meeting.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.307
Not even the girl's father?

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:46.894
Could I have a word alone?

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.271
Yes.

01:00:56.696 --> 01:00:57.697
Fernando,

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:00.241
can we trust this guy?

01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:01.367
Yes.

01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:03.328
Why?

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:09.959
He won't tell anyone?

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:13.087
He retired years ago.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:15.798
I made him swear on it.

01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:20.011
The second message
was also sent to Bea.

01:01:20.595 --> 01:01:21.596
Bea?

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:23.765
Paco's wife.

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:30.646
How long have you known Paco?

01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:34.484
We grew up in the same house.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:36.819
Until I left,
we were always together.

01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:38.446
Together?

01:01:39.072 --> 01:01:40.406
Yes, together.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:42.408
In love.

01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:44.410
And now?

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:48.164
We each have our own life now.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.833
It's over.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:52.710
On good terms?

01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:56.798
Why does that matter?

01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:02.762
I'm trying to understand why
the SMS was sent to his wife.

01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:03.846
Excuse me.

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:06.307
Dad, I'm going now.

01:02:09.435 --> 01:02:10.436
Well...

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:11.854
Take care.

01:02:12.063 --> 01:02:14.190
You too.
I'm going to miss you.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.525
I'll miss you too.

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:20.363
- Call me when you arrive.
- I will.

01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:33.209
Do you always come without him?

01:02:33.418 --> 01:02:34.419
No.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.380
He couldn't come this time.

01:02:42.135 --> 01:02:44.720
If I find anything,
I'll call Fernando.

01:02:45.138 --> 01:02:46.139
Thank you, Jorge.

01:02:46.389 --> 01:02:50.268
No, stay, Fernando.
I want to check the video with you.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.894
I'll drive you back.

01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:54.730
Andrés!

01:02:56.274 --> 01:02:57.275
Hello?

01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:00.278
Andrés!

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:05.074
Sit down, please, I'm in a hurry.

01:03:06.325 --> 01:03:09.078
It's been so long,
and you have to rush off?

01:03:09.412 --> 01:03:11.122
- Let's try it.
- No.

01:03:11.414 --> 01:03:13.249
You don't want to try your wine?

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:15.918
What's wrong?

01:03:16.127 --> 01:03:17.253
You seem upset.

01:03:17.462 --> 01:03:18.588
I have a favor to ask.

01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:22.592
But I beg you,
before saying no,

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.885
please think about it.

01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:26.888
I always think before I speak.

01:03:30.475 --> 01:03:32.643
I need money urgently.

01:03:33.478 --> 01:03:34.479
For the grape harvest?

01:03:35.688 --> 01:03:37.106
No, it's a personal matter.

01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:42.403
Can you help me with that?

01:03:45.114 --> 01:03:46.115
I've thought about it

01:03:47.116 --> 01:03:48.117
and the answer is no.

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:49.577
Okay.

01:03:50.536 --> 01:03:52.580
I'm willing to sell you my half.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.665
Why now, all of a sudden?

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:56.000
Well...

01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:00.296
This partnership of ours

01:04:01.172 --> 01:04:02.673
has to end one day.

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:06.636
We must find some sucker
to buy the whole thing.

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:10.681
But I need the cash, urgently.

01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:12.934
So I'll sell you my share

01:04:13.184 --> 01:04:14.352
at a good price.

01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:18.689
You've never let buyers
visit the estate before.

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:20.024
Right.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.109
Has something happened?

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:27.323
Think about my offer
and give me an answer soon.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.202
- I have to go.
- Go where?

01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:33.162
Sit down.

01:04:33.412 --> 01:04:34.539
Why do you need the money?

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.499
Tell me soon. It's urgent.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:38.709
Alright.

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.336
I'll think about it.

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:03.025
What's wrong?

01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:05.861
What's wrong?

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:07.863
What's this?

01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:14.370
When did you get this?

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:15.788
Just now.

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:22.545
She doesn't have her medicines
with her.

01:05:30.595 --> 01:05:31.679
Hi.

01:05:33.222 --> 01:05:34.348
Yes, I'm with Laura.

01:05:35.391 --> 01:05:37.602
You just got it?
Read it.

01:05:38.728 --> 01:05:39.770
Hold on. Read it.

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:43.357
<i>“Your daughter isn't well,
she can't breathe.</i>

01:05:43.608 --> 01:05:45.943
<i>“Prepare the money before she dies.“</i>

01:05:47.987 --> 01:05:50.239
She got the same message.
I'll call you back.

01:05:58.581 --> 01:05:59.790
I can't breathe.

01:06:00.416 --> 01:06:01.709
- Are you alright?
- No.

01:06:02.752 --> 01:06:03.753
Deep breaths.

01:06:04.587 --> 01:06:05.588
That's it.

01:06:10.635 --> 01:06:11.636
Do you want to get out?

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:12.970
I'm suffocating.

01:06:31.656 --> 01:06:32.740
I said to her:

01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:34.450
"What about my mother?"

01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:37.828
And she said:
"Pack your bags in secret,

01:06:38.663 --> 01:06:39.664
"and leave."

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:41.582
Maybe that's what she did.

01:06:41.957 --> 01:06:43.167
Why would she do that?

01:06:44.877 --> 01:06:45.878
I don't know.

01:06:50.299 --> 01:06:51.300
See you later.

01:06:51.384 --> 01:06:52.385
See you.

01:06:54.637 --> 01:06:55.638
Fuck.

01:06:55.971 --> 01:06:57.098
Any news?

01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:01.977
We watched the videos
all afternoon,

01:07:02.812 --> 01:07:03.813
there's nothing.

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:07.108
My friend said one thing
that made sense.

01:07:07.525 --> 01:07:09.443
What if she wasn't kidnapped?

01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:12.113
They were supposed
to come together, right?

01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:15.783
Why did Alejandro

01:07:16.075 --> 01:07:17.326
suddenly change his plans?

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:27.128
Laura said something came up at work.

01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:28.796
He hasn't worked for two years.

01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:31.674
- What?
- The company went broke.

01:07:32.508 --> 01:07:33.509
Two years.

01:07:34.427 --> 01:07:35.469
Shit.

01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:40.975
Don't fuck with me, Fernando.

01:07:41.684 --> 01:07:44.645
How could he have set it all up
from Argentina?

01:07:44.854 --> 01:07:46.814
Perhaps they're in on it together?

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.401
Maybe he's sending the messages
from Argentina.

01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:51.694
If that were the case,

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:54.697
Laura would be the first
to suspect her husband.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.032
Why would she doubt her husband?

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:01.245
I don't know.

01:08:03.956 --> 01:08:08.002
Don't you think it's weird
that they write to your wife?

01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:14.258
It's weird.

01:09:50.688 --> 01:09:54.650
POLICE

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:07.621
I'm really scared.

01:10:08.497 --> 01:10:09.832
What if they hurt her?

01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:33.147
Fernando's right.

01:10:33.856 --> 01:10:35.649
We have to call the police.

01:10:36.442 --> 01:10:38.360
If we don't call them,

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:40.195
what other option do we have?

01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:49.163
I'd call the police.

01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:50.664
And until they do something,

01:10:50.873 --> 01:10:54.043
how will she survive
without her medicine?

01:10:54.126 --> 01:10:55.127
Take it easy.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.339
God will help us.

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:01.759
God? Why did he do this to us?

01:11:02.051 --> 01:11:03.761
Stop this nonsense.

01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:06.347
We have to find the money.

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:09.558
How?
Are they going to steal it?

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:11.435
We must wait.

01:11:14.146 --> 01:11:17.274
Paco may be able to help us
with the money.

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:20.819
All of it?

01:11:24.156 --> 01:11:27.076
He spoke to his partner
about selling the estate.

01:11:39.964 --> 01:11:41.632
Why would he do that?

01:11:42.174 --> 01:11:43.717
He's not going to do it.

01:11:43.968 --> 01:11:47.596
He's pretending
so the word spreads.

01:11:50.432 --> 01:11:51.433
Was it his idea?

01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:56.105
We went to see
a friend of Fernando's,

01:11:56.355 --> 01:11:58.273
a retired policeman,

01:11:59.108 --> 01:12:00.234
for advice.

01:12:00.776 --> 01:12:04.071
He told us to pretend
that we're gathering the money.

01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:05.447
And then?

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:07.074
Then...

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.619
In a few days, a week,

01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:12.997
when they realize
we don't have the money?

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:18.919
I don't know.

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:22.673
I don't know what will happen.

01:12:22.965 --> 01:12:25.592
I can't even think about it.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:02.171
Sorry to make you come here.
My friend wants

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:03.422
to be discreet.

01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:05.340
- Where is he?
- In the car.

01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:08.052
He's waiting for you.
His name's Jorge.

01:13:10.763 --> 01:13:13.140
Laura, he wants to see him alone.

01:13:22.858 --> 01:13:24.026
He's very composed.

01:13:25.944 --> 01:13:27.404
He's not showing it,

01:13:28.197 --> 01:13:29.740
but he's suffering inside.

01:13:40.459 --> 01:13:43.545
Do you trust your husband
completely?

01:13:47.049 --> 01:13:48.425
Why do you ask?

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:57.851
He adores his children.

01:14:01.563 --> 01:14:05.192
Do we run any risk
if we tell the police?

01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:08.237
Even if the risk is minimal,

01:14:08.904 --> 01:14:10.572
it must be done very discreetly.

01:14:13.283 --> 01:14:16.620
They can investigate in secret,
without anyone knowing?

01:14:20.124 --> 01:14:23.085
Why didn't you come
with your family?

01:14:25.671 --> 01:14:28.257
I had some interviews
for a potential job.

01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:30.801
Did they go well?

01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:33.262
What does that matter?

01:14:38.142 --> 01:14:40.561
Everything matters
to save your daughter.

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:43.605
- Did the job work out?
- No.

01:14:43.856 --> 01:14:45.816
- Why is that?
- Why...

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:50.070
Ask the people
who didn't hire me.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.572
Because of the drinking?

01:14:53.198 --> 01:14:54.324
Who told you that?

01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:02.416
I haven't had a drink
in 16 years.

01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:05.460
Your wife says you're bankrupt.

01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:08.463
So?

01:15:08.797 --> 01:15:11.300
The police will tell you

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:14.136
that this isn't
the work of strangers.

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:15.971
Sure.

01:15:20.392 --> 01:15:21.685
It was me.

01:15:23.645 --> 01:15:24.771
It was her father.

01:15:32.196 --> 01:15:33.488
Get in, we're going.

01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:38.076
Who was it?

01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:40.412
Was it you?

01:15:40.913 --> 01:15:42.789
You told that idiot everything?

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.041
Told him what?

01:15:44.166 --> 01:15:46.543
The drinking, the bankruptcy,
all of it!

01:15:46.835 --> 01:15:48.629
Not now, Alejandro.

01:15:57.387 --> 01:15:58.513
She's my daughter!

01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:03.018
Let me decide
what should be done!

01:16:10.025 --> 01:16:11.235
What assholes!

01:16:12.444 --> 01:16:13.654
Assholes!

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:16.406
It was me who spoke to him.

01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:19.660
He asked me about you.
I thought it might help.

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:24.039
You thought it would help to know
that I'm unemployed and ruined?

01:16:24.289 --> 01:16:26.166
- What are you saying?
- Answer me!

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:27.668
Why would I suspect you?

01:16:27.876 --> 01:16:29.437
- Did I say that?
- You're insinuating it.

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:31.171
Why would I suspect you?

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.257
- Your whole family does.
- What?

01:16:33.548 --> 01:16:35.217
The way they looked at me
at breakfast!

01:16:35.467 --> 01:16:36.468
And those two!

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:40.389
They're worried about your daughter
and all you can talk about is God.

01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:42.391
Yes, they suspect you!

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.705
Get some sleep.

01:17:07.916 --> 01:17:10.377
How can I sleep
not knowing where my daughter is

01:17:13.255 --> 01:17:15.048
or what they might be doing to her?

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.610
I hate myself
for not being able to do anything.

01:17:36.778 --> 01:17:38.655
Not even tell the police.

01:17:39.448 --> 01:17:40.449
My love...

01:17:42.451 --> 01:17:44.161
There is one way to help her.

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:48.415
If you agree.

01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:55.297
Paco could give us the money.

01:17:58.008 --> 01:17:59.843
You said he was pretending.

01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:02.012
He could do it.

01:18:07.309 --> 01:18:09.102
Why would he give us
so much money?

01:18:10.312 --> 01:18:11.605
Let me try.

01:18:12.564 --> 01:18:13.648
Let me speak to him.

01:18:15.025 --> 01:18:16.109
What will you say?

01:18:23.992 --> 01:18:26.661
I'll do anything to get her back.

01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:29.623
No.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.126
Think of Irene.
We're losing our daughter.

01:18:34.086 --> 01:18:35.087
He won't give it to you.

01:18:35.337 --> 01:18:36.463
He might.

01:18:37.172 --> 01:18:38.298
And if he doesn't,

01:18:38.924 --> 01:18:40.342
we'll go to the police.

01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:47.057
He won't give you the money.

01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:53.063
You'll tell him
and end up with nothing.

01:18:55.357 --> 01:18:56.650
Please.

01:18:57.776 --> 01:18:58.902
I'm begging you, please.

01:19:01.947 --> 01:19:02.948
I'm begging you!

01:19:16.044 --> 01:19:18.505
<i>I asked to hear
my daughter's voice.</i>

01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:20.924
<i>They put me through to her.</i>

01:19:22.217 --> 01:19:24.928
<i>I asked if she was alright,
she said no.</i>

01:19:26.388 --> 01:19:29.558
<i>After, they strangled her
and threw her down a well.</i>

01:19:31.435 --> 01:19:33.562
<i>When they pulled the body out of the well,</i>

01:19:34.146 --> 01:19:36.189
<i>I couldn't recognize my daughter.</i>

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:39.693
<i>I said it wasn't her.</i>

01:20:03.258 --> 01:20:04.259
Paco...

01:20:17.439 --> 01:20:19.316
What are you doing here?

01:20:20.442 --> 01:20:21.443
Are you alone?

01:20:22.777 --> 01:20:23.778
Yes.

01:20:24.696 --> 01:20:25.739
Did he say anything?

01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:27.240
Who?

01:20:27.824 --> 01:20:28.825
Your partner.

01:20:29.117 --> 01:20:32.746
No news, but word has spread,
that's what matters.

01:20:34.498 --> 01:20:35.665
Sure, but...

01:20:41.046 --> 01:20:43.089
Would you be willing
to sell it for real?

01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:48.094
- The estate?
- Yes.

01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:06.029
If this happened to your child,

01:21:07.155 --> 01:21:08.657
would you do nothing?

01:21:12.244 --> 01:21:13.828
I don't know what to say.

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:20.794
Many people work here.
Their families depend on it.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:25.632
I know, but...

01:21:39.396 --> 01:21:41.356
You still haven't forgiven me.

01:21:41.523 --> 01:21:42.524
What for?

01:21:42.607 --> 01:21:43.608
For leaving you.

01:21:45.193 --> 01:21:48.530
- I don't want to discuss this.
- And you never let me explain.

01:21:50.699 --> 01:21:52.409
I don't want to discuss this now.

01:21:52.909 --> 01:21:53.910
Not here.

01:21:55.245 --> 01:21:56.246
Not anywhere.

01:21:56.538 --> 01:21:58.164
I don't want to discuss this.

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:10.594
Do you remember
the first time I came home

01:22:10.885 --> 01:22:13.013
after getting married in Argentina?

01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:16.766
We hadn't seen each other
for three years.

01:22:18.059 --> 01:22:20.770
I came alone
and you weren't with Bea yet.

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:28.695
- Remember?
- Yes, I do.

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:31.698
And the last night too?

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:34.784
Yes, I remember.

01:22:40.624 --> 01:22:42.542
You took me to the airport.

01:22:43.293 --> 01:22:45.420
We chatted all the way.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.634
Suddenly, you stopped the car.

01:22:52.177 --> 01:22:54.471
You hugged me and started to cry.

01:22:55.096 --> 01:22:59.142
You said that you couldn't believe
you'd lost me.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:04.105
We got out of the car,

01:23:05.523 --> 01:23:07.108
you came over to me.

01:23:08.276 --> 01:23:09.319
You kissed me...

01:23:21.206 --> 01:23:23.917
I'm just saying that
if this is your idea of revenge,

01:23:24.459 --> 01:23:26.294
don't hurt the girl.

01:23:31.299 --> 01:23:32.592
She's your daughter.

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:35.428
What?

01:23:45.647 --> 01:23:47.107
No, don't do this to me.

01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:52.028
She's your daughter.

01:24:16.845 --> 01:24:17.846
Are you alright?

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.181
Yes.

01:24:44.748 --> 01:24:46.499
What did Laura want?

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:48.418
Help.

01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:51.755
But you are helping her.

01:24:52.046 --> 01:24:53.173
She wanted money.

01:24:56.384 --> 01:24:58.052
- Why you?
- I don't know.

01:24:59.721 --> 01:25:02.515
Maybe she thinks she sold me
that land

01:25:03.057 --> 01:25:05.018
too cheaply.

01:25:13.943 --> 01:25:15.528
After all these years?

01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:42.639
You okay?

01:25:45.266 --> 01:25:47.727
Come and sit down.
Will you eat something?

01:25:48.269 --> 01:25:49.896
We've had lunch, thanks.

01:25:50.104 --> 01:25:51.898
We wondered if you'd heard anything.

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:53.274
Nothing, we're still waiting.

01:26:12.377 --> 01:26:15.088
Paco and I are very upset
about all this.

01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:19.592
We want to do all we can
to help you.

01:26:22.846 --> 01:26:24.264
The thing is

01:26:24.514 --> 01:26:26.516
we get the feeling...

01:26:27.976 --> 01:26:30.103
that you think we owe you.

01:26:30.687 --> 01:26:33.606
As if it's our duty
to help you.

01:26:34.983 --> 01:26:36.651
Bea, this isn't the right time.

01:26:36.901 --> 01:26:38.319
Everyone is here.

01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:41.781
I'd like to get things straight.

01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:43.116
What things?

01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:45.535
What Bea means is...

01:26:45.827 --> 01:26:47.370
Let her talk.

01:26:50.498 --> 01:26:52.709
You still have claims
on that land.

01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:55.003
- Who's "you"?
- All of you.

01:26:58.423 --> 01:26:59.883
We don't have any claims.

01:27:00.174 --> 01:27:02.719
But we haven't forgotten
how Paco bought the land.

01:27:03.011 --> 01:27:04.304
The land was worthless.

01:27:04.554 --> 01:27:06.347
- Of course.
- It was.

01:27:06.598 --> 01:27:08.308
Paco and I slaved for 7 years

01:27:08.558 --> 01:27:09.851
to recover that land.

01:27:10.101 --> 01:27:12.562
- That land is mine.
- It belongs to whoever works it.

01:27:12.854 --> 01:27:16.149
Are you going to share it
with the day workers?

01:27:16.399 --> 01:27:18.568
- We didn't come for that.
- I did.

01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:20.153
I only hope that Irene

01:27:20.403 --> 01:27:23.823
comes back soon
so we can end these arguments.

01:27:24.073 --> 01:27:26.826
Not talking about things
doesn't mean they're resolved.

01:27:28.953 --> 01:27:30.705
I sold that land very cheaply

01:27:30.955 --> 01:27:33.708
because I wanted to help a friend.

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:35.752
But you needed the money.

01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:37.045
Enough!

01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:39.213
Sorry.

01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:48.514
I don't need anyone's money.

01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:51.517
Thank you.

01:27:52.602 --> 01:27:53.770
My daughter...

01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:55.855
will come back.

01:28:01.069 --> 01:28:02.403
God will help me.

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.741
Excuse me.

01:28:27.595 --> 01:28:29.597
- What else did you tell him?
- Everything.

01:28:30.765 --> 01:28:32.308
We swore.

01:28:35.103 --> 01:28:37.730
Forgive me, it's for our child.

01:28:37.939 --> 01:28:41.734
Precisely, for her
you should've said nothing.

01:28:42.527 --> 01:28:44.988
- What have you done?
- It's for our daughter.

01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:48.741
What will this do to her?

01:29:46.674 --> 01:29:47.675
What's wrong?

01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:50.553
You didn't have that before.

01:29:53.723 --> 01:29:54.724
Look.

01:30:07.028 --> 01:30:09.072
What are you doing to yourself?

01:30:19.916 --> 01:30:21.667
I'm going to sell my shares
to Andrés.

01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:25.713
You said it wasn't for real.

01:30:25.963 --> 01:30:28.341
I'm terrified for that girl.

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.845
Paying them just encourages them.
Tomorrow it'll be another kid.

01:30:33.054 --> 01:30:34.764
If she were ours,
you wouldn't say that.

01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:35.848
I would.

01:30:36.557 --> 01:30:38.684
If you were a mother,
you wouldn't be so sure.

01:30:38.893 --> 01:30:41.354
Luckily,
I never wanted to be a mother.

01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:43.689
She's my daughter.

01:30:54.909 --> 01:30:56.285
What did you say?

01:30:56.911 --> 01:30:58.037
She's my daughter.

01:31:04.252 --> 01:31:05.378
What are you saying?

01:31:13.094 --> 01:31:14.595
Have you gone mad?

01:31:38.619 --> 01:31:40.913
Don't touch me! Please!

01:31:41.455 --> 01:31:42.957
- Let's talk.
- I don't want to talk!

01:31:43.207 --> 01:31:44.750
Sit down and we'll talk.

01:31:44.959 --> 01:31:46.919
- I don't want to!
- Listen to me.

01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:50.256
- I thought we had no secrets.
- We don't.

01:31:50.464 --> 01:31:52.633
Go away! I want to be alone.

01:31:53.009 --> 01:31:54.343
Laura told me yesterday.

01:31:54.635 --> 01:31:57.471
Yesterday?
And you believe her!

01:31:57.722 --> 01:32:00.683
We slept together
one last time and...

01:32:00.975 --> 01:32:03.352
And she got pregnant?

01:32:03.978 --> 01:32:06.314
Don't you realize
that all they want is money?

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:09.692
Maybe they made up
the story about the estate!

01:32:09.984 --> 01:32:12.695
That you conned them
and didn't pay enough...

01:32:12.987 --> 01:32:16.115
That didn't work, so they make up
this lie to force you!

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:19.452
- How do you know it's a lie?
- How do you know it isn't?

01:32:21.704 --> 01:32:24.207
They don't want money.
You heard them yesterday.

01:32:24.498 --> 01:32:26.459
What else would they say?

01:32:26.876 --> 01:32:28.961
They have to keep up appearances.

01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:31.964
Then his wife tells you
her daughter's yours!

01:32:33.549 --> 01:32:36.469
And why hold this wedding
in the village?

01:32:36.677 --> 01:32:38.638
Nobody does that now.

01:32:39.347 --> 01:32:41.849
They're all involved!

01:32:42.516 --> 01:32:45.144
You slept with her one last time.

01:32:45.353 --> 01:32:48.564
What if the next day
she slept with her husband?

01:32:49.607 --> 01:32:51.984
How do you know she's your daughter?

01:32:54.946 --> 01:32:56.864
Why is she telling you now?

01:33:18.135 --> 01:33:20.054
How can you be so naive?

01:33:40.283 --> 01:33:41.575
Is Laura here?

01:33:43.744 --> 01:33:46.038
She's upstairs with Rocío. Why?

01:33:50.918 --> 01:33:52.712
My little girl...

01:33:53.504 --> 01:33:55.881
Where are you, my baby?

01:34:06.976 --> 01:34:07.977
Good morning.

01:34:09.937 --> 01:34:12.106
Could you leave us alone
for a moment?

01:34:30.124 --> 01:34:31.125
Did you lie to him?

01:34:34.795 --> 01:34:35.796
About what?

01:34:38.341 --> 01:34:39.967
What you said to Paco.

01:34:43.637 --> 01:34:45.598
I didn't think he'd tell you.

01:34:53.314 --> 01:34:55.608
If you're trying
to get the money...

01:34:56.901 --> 01:34:57.943
with this lie...

01:34:59.653 --> 01:35:01.614
I'll have to tell
your husband everything.

01:35:04.992 --> 01:35:06.285
It's not a lie.

01:35:09.914 --> 01:35:11.457
My husband already knows.

01:35:30.726 --> 01:35:32.019
What's wrong?

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:34.563
The guys heard in the village

01:35:35.231 --> 01:35:37.149
that you're selling the estate.

01:35:38.192 --> 01:35:39.360
Who'll pay us?

01:35:39.610 --> 01:35:43.322
Don't listen to that crap.
I'll pay you. Get back to work.

01:35:52.706 --> 01:35:53.707
Laura?

01:35:59.839 --> 01:36:00.840
Is Laura here?

01:36:00.923 --> 01:36:02.550
I think she's upstairs. Why?

01:36:03.426 --> 01:36:04.927
Someone wants to see her.

01:36:05.136 --> 01:36:06.137
Who?

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.389
A friend. Tell her to come down.

01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:17.940
- Laura!
- Any news?

01:36:20.234 --> 01:36:21.694
Is something wrong?

01:36:25.406 --> 01:36:27.533
They say you sold your estate.

01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:31.162
Yes.

01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:37.460
It was locked.

01:36:43.174 --> 01:36:46.760
They locked it
so you'd think she was still inside

01:36:47.011 --> 01:36:50.055
and take longer to realize
that they'd taken her.

01:36:56.353 --> 01:36:58.230
- Is he your son?
- Yes.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.401
He was sleeping
in the same room that night?

01:37:07.198 --> 01:37:10.326
It's strange
that they didn't take him.

01:37:10.618 --> 01:37:12.495
It would've been less risky.

01:37:13.204 --> 01:37:16.248
A sleeping boy is easier
to take than a teenager.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.587
So...
they had a reason to abduct her.

01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:22.671
What?

01:37:27.176 --> 01:37:30.471
Fernando told me some things
about your daughter.

01:37:30.971 --> 01:37:31.972
What things?

01:37:37.478 --> 01:37:40.773
Did anyone already know
that you aren't the father?

01:37:51.033 --> 01:37:52.701
Bea spoke to Fernando.

01:37:56.497 --> 01:37:58.040
I don't know.

01:37:58.332 --> 01:38:00.292
They aren't professionals.

01:38:01.168 --> 01:38:04.463
They're people close to you
who have this information.

01:38:04.838 --> 01:38:06.799
Nobody knew until now.

01:38:07.049 --> 01:38:10.511
They didn't take her
because she's Paco's daughter,

01:38:10.761 --> 01:38:11.971
for his money.

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:15.182
But they thought...

01:38:16.058 --> 01:38:18.852
they'd have a better chance
by taking her.

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.021
That is,

01:38:21.272 --> 01:38:24.400
if you couldn't pay the ransom,
Paco would help.

01:38:29.530 --> 01:38:31.490
When we decided...

01:38:32.908 --> 01:38:33.993
to have her...

01:38:37.121 --> 01:38:42.001
we promised each other
that we'd never tell anyone.

01:38:44.795 --> 01:38:47.506
Keep an eye on those around you.

01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:51.427
Try to find out who knows.

01:39:15.075 --> 01:39:16.702
Sit down, please.

01:39:25.461 --> 01:39:27.046
Did he really sell the land?

01:39:28.964 --> 01:39:29.965
Why?

01:39:33.135 --> 01:39:34.136
I don't know.

01:39:34.428 --> 01:39:36.305
What are people saying?

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.681
About what?

01:39:37.765 --> 01:39:39.558
This crazy thing he's doing.

01:39:39.808 --> 01:39:41.393
People gossip.

01:39:41.602 --> 01:39:44.730
When they've nothing to do
in the village, they talk.

01:39:49.693 --> 01:39:50.694
Gossip about what?

01:39:53.697 --> 01:39:55.991
That one only does this
for one's child.

01:40:02.247 --> 01:40:03.248
And before?

01:40:06.835 --> 01:40:07.920
Fernando...

01:40:09.797 --> 01:40:10.923
Please.

01:40:15.386 --> 01:40:17.429
At first there were suspicions.

01:40:17.638 --> 01:40:18.806
About my daughter?

01:40:20.224 --> 01:40:21.433
What suspicions?

01:40:23.352 --> 01:40:25.604
Paco and Laura were together
a long time.

01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:29.608
They say that your daughter
sometimes does things

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.654
that resemble Paco as a child.

01:40:34.154 --> 01:40:35.197
They say?

01:40:36.073 --> 01:40:37.074
Who says?

01:40:37.908 --> 01:40:39.952
- The family.
- But who?

01:40:40.911 --> 01:40:41.954
Some of them.

01:40:48.836 --> 01:40:50.337
So they know.

01:40:52.214 --> 01:40:53.882
They hadn't mentioned it for years.

01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:57.219
But now that Paco's
sold the estate...

01:40:57.511 --> 01:40:58.512
Now...

01:41:00.347 --> 01:41:01.849
everybody knows.

01:41:47.144 --> 01:41:48.604
Do you still love her?

01:41:52.441 --> 01:41:53.525
It's for the girl.

01:42:00.741 --> 01:42:01.867
No, it isn't.

01:42:05.788 --> 01:42:07.539
What if they did this themselves?

01:42:10.626 --> 01:42:12.753
I know what I'm doing.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.969
No, you don't.

01:42:59.842 --> 01:43:02.761
- Who's that girl?
- My son's girlfriend.

01:43:04.346 --> 01:43:07.599
They don't live here,
they just came for one night.

01:44:18.045 --> 01:44:19.046
Alejandro.

01:44:20.464 --> 01:44:22.007
I'm sure we'll find her.

01:44:22.966 --> 01:44:25.093
Whoever did this
can't be far away.

01:44:41.443 --> 01:44:44.237
I've got the money,
I received it today.

01:44:46.698 --> 01:44:47.699
The full amount.

01:44:49.993 --> 01:44:51.370
Why are you doing this?

01:44:51.662 --> 01:44:53.372
Why am I doing this?

01:44:55.749 --> 01:44:59.211
Because if I didn't
and something happened to...

01:45:03.423 --> 01:45:04.424
to Irene,

01:45:05.258 --> 01:45:07.219
I'd never forgive myself.

01:45:08.595 --> 01:45:10.764
Why wouldn't you forgive yourself?

01:45:11.014 --> 01:45:12.724
You've no obligation to her.

01:45:12.933 --> 01:45:13.934
What?

01:45:16.687 --> 01:45:18.563
You say I have no obligation?

01:45:20.357 --> 01:45:21.984
No, but I have every right.

01:45:24.444 --> 01:45:25.737
- Really?
- Yes.

01:45:27.322 --> 01:45:30.450
Sixteen years have gone by.
Sixteen years.

01:45:31.952 --> 01:45:34.621
And now that you need me,
you tell me?

01:45:45.132 --> 01:45:47.426
Paco, let me tell you something.

01:45:54.641 --> 01:45:57.436
Irene's birth saved my life.

01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:01.273
I was...

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:07.446
Lost, depressed, finished,
because of alcohol.

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.325
Sometimes I never even went home.

01:46:15.579 --> 01:46:19.207
One night, desperate,
I asked God:

01:46:20.876 --> 01:46:24.004
"Kill me or save me, please."

01:46:30.052 --> 01:46:32.054
That night, when I got home,

01:46:33.847 --> 01:46:36.641
Laura confessed to me
that she was carrying your child.

01:46:42.105 --> 01:46:44.066
I thought it was the end,

01:46:46.193 --> 01:46:47.569
that I'd lost her,

01:46:48.862 --> 01:46:50.405
forever, really.

01:46:52.032 --> 01:46:54.409
But it was quite the opposite.

01:46:56.870 --> 01:47:00.373
God hit me hard to make me react.

01:47:00.957 --> 01:47:02.834
- God?
- Yes.

01:47:07.547 --> 01:47:09.216
Laura wanted an abortion.

01:47:10.801 --> 01:47:12.052
I didn't know.

01:47:12.469 --> 01:47:14.429
I convinced her we should keep it.

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.769
God hit me hard
to get me out of that shit.

01:47:21.895 --> 01:47:22.896
God?

01:47:23.897 --> 01:47:24.898
My God.

01:47:25.607 --> 01:47:26.608
He...

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.902
pulled me out of hell.

01:47:30.904 --> 01:47:33.573
And I'm sure that
he's going to save her now.

01:47:33.824 --> 01:47:36.034
Your God's going to save Irene?

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:40.413
Maybe your God is using me
to save Irene.

01:47:40.664 --> 01:47:42.958
You saved her once,
now it's my turn.

01:47:54.761 --> 01:47:57.222
I'm risking my daughter's life
for your damn pride.

01:47:57.430 --> 01:48:00.058
What pride?
I have no pride left.

01:48:00.684 --> 01:48:02.936
You have no pride?

01:48:03.603 --> 01:48:05.730
Then accept his help to save her!

01:48:05.981 --> 01:48:08.733
If your God had wanted to,
he'd have done it already!

01:49:40.075 --> 01:49:42.661
- What are you doing here?
- Tell him to come out.

01:49:42.869 --> 01:49:44.704
- Anyone follow you?
- No. Call him.

01:49:50.085 --> 01:49:51.920
We agreed you'd never come here.

01:49:53.713 --> 01:49:56.925
- How's my daughter?
- Fine, but I can't keep this up.

01:49:57.384 --> 01:49:58.510
What's wrong?

01:49:58.718 --> 01:50:00.428
- Maybe someone followed her.
- Shut up.

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:01.888
Let's hear her out.

01:50:02.305 --> 01:50:04.099
This has to end.
We're destroying my family.

01:50:04.391 --> 01:50:05.433
What's happened?

01:50:05.725 --> 01:50:07.894
- Paco sold his estate.
- That's good.

01:50:08.144 --> 01:50:11.189
We must free her now,
they suspect the whole family.

01:50:11.815 --> 01:50:12.857
Do they suspect you?

01:50:13.066 --> 01:50:15.026
Maybe.
But tomorrow they'll work it all out.

01:50:15.902 --> 01:50:18.196
Relax.
It'll all be over tomorrow.

01:50:18.405 --> 01:50:19.765
I can't keep watching them suffer.

01:50:19.948 --> 01:50:21.116
- Just wait.
- No!

01:50:21.408 --> 01:50:23.368
- Fuck this.
- Stay out of it.

01:50:24.661 --> 01:50:28.290
If we're caught, we'll say
you had nothing to do with it.

01:50:28.581 --> 01:50:29.791
Let her go or I'll tell them.

01:50:30.166 --> 01:50:32.210
- Wait until tomorrow morning.
- No.

01:50:33.503 --> 01:50:36.256
You can't say no
after all this.

01:50:36.756 --> 01:50:38.236
- Where are you going?
- To tell them.

01:50:38.383 --> 01:50:39.384
Wait.

01:50:39.467 --> 01:50:40.468
- No!
- Wait!

01:50:41.761 --> 01:50:42.762
I can't take it anymore.

01:50:42.929 --> 01:50:44.973
You promised to see it
through to the end.

01:50:45.932 --> 01:50:48.476
- I was wrong!
- Too late.

01:50:50.979 --> 01:50:54.065
Let's split up for real,
instead of pretending.

01:50:55.275 --> 01:50:57.402
Tomorrow it'll be over,
we'll leave.

01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:58.778
We'll get arrested.

01:50:59.029 --> 01:51:01.573
If there's a slim chance
of getting the money, I'm in.

01:51:01.948 --> 01:51:03.575
- I'm not!
- We had a pact.

01:51:03.783 --> 01:51:07.245
Did the pact include sending messages
to Paco's wife?

01:51:07.787 --> 01:51:08.788
You did that?

01:51:08.997 --> 01:51:09.998
I did.

01:51:10.165 --> 01:51:11.916
Without consulting me?

01:51:12.167 --> 01:51:14.461
Sending it to one person
looks suspicious.

01:51:14.878 --> 01:51:17.505
- This is revenge on my family.
- I hate your damn family.

01:51:17.839 --> 01:51:19.674
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:51:19.966 --> 01:51:22.260
Don't force me
to tell the girl everything.

01:51:24.471 --> 01:51:25.972
I beg you, please.

01:51:26.306 --> 01:51:27.307
Let her go!

01:51:28.016 --> 01:51:29.642
Please!

01:51:35.815 --> 01:51:36.816
Listen.

01:51:43.156 --> 01:51:45.283
- I'll free her.
- Right now?

01:51:46.201 --> 01:51:48.661
In the middle of the night?

01:51:49.371 --> 01:51:51.122
- I'll free her at dawn.
- Promise me.

01:51:51.373 --> 01:51:52.374
I will.

01:51:56.169 --> 01:51:58.129
Swear on the life of our daughter.

01:52:06.262 --> 01:52:07.263
Swear you will.

01:52:13.061 --> 01:52:14.187
I swear.

01:52:33.206 --> 01:52:34.499
I'll miss you.

01:53:19.085 --> 01:53:20.712
You took your time.

01:53:24.299 --> 01:53:25.467
It took a while.

01:53:29.012 --> 01:53:30.221
What did the doctor say?

01:53:32.265 --> 01:53:33.391
A virus.

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.650
Did he give you any medicine?

01:53:46.029 --> 01:53:48.239
Why all the questions?

01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:04.631
Why are your pants wet?

01:54:10.303 --> 01:54:11.429
Where have you been?

01:54:16.976 --> 01:54:18.937
I stopped to throw up
along the road.

01:54:19.145 --> 01:54:22.190
I washed my face
and my clothes got wet.

01:54:52.053 --> 01:54:53.638
Save <i>me</i> for God's sake!

01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:56.724
<i>They're going to kill me today!</i>

01:54:57.183 --> 01:54:58.518
<i>I beg you!</i>

01:54:59.227 --> 01:55:02.063
<i>Leave the money where they say.</i>

01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:03.856
<i>I beg you, please!</i>

01:55:42.562 --> 01:55:46.232
<i>You have reached the police.
Your call may be recorded.</i>

01:57:24.330 --> 01:57:25.456
Hello?

01:57:27.166 --> 01:57:28.167
Can you hear me?

01:57:31.337 --> 01:57:34.882
The money's in the car,
but I want to see her first.

01:57:35.174 --> 01:57:37.051
I want to hear Irene!

01:59:07.433 --> 01:59:08.434
Are you alright?

01:59:19.362 --> 01:59:21.405
It's me, Paco.

01:59:21.781 --> 01:59:22.782
How are you?

01:59:23.032 --> 01:59:25.284
Did they do anything to you?

01:59:44.887 --> 01:59:46.097
Did I hurt you?

02:00:06.075 --> 02:00:07.201
Darling!

02:00:59.879 --> 02:01:02.840
My baby...
Speak to me, darling.

02:01:03.049 --> 02:01:04.050
Thank you.

02:01:08.304 --> 02:01:10.014
Did you give them the money?

02:01:17.438 --> 02:01:18.522
Thank you.

02:01:21.150 --> 02:01:22.193
I'll get it back to you.

02:01:23.986 --> 02:01:27.031
She needs to see a doctor,
she looks very weak.

02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:29.909
I love you so much!

02:01:33.996 --> 02:01:35.039
Careful.

02:01:45.216 --> 02:01:46.550
Come, darling.

02:01:46.884 --> 02:01:48.844
Careful.

02:01:57.436 --> 02:01:58.437
Thank you.

02:02:29.135 --> 02:02:30.136
Mariana!

02:02:36.475 --> 02:02:37.643
They've found Irene!

02:03:07.089 --> 02:03:08.090
Bea?

02:03:53.094 --> 02:03:54.095
Laura!

02:03:54.678 --> 02:03:55.679
Irene!

02:03:55.763 --> 02:03:56.764
Here!

02:04:10.236 --> 02:04:11.237
Honey.

02:05:42.494 --> 02:05:44.663
- I'll help you.
- Thanks, Joan.

02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:45.831
Give me that.

02:05:46.165 --> 02:05:48.626
- We have to hurry.
- Why? We have time.

02:05:48.834 --> 02:05:51.337
I have to return the car
at the airport.

02:05:55.591 --> 02:05:59.803
Don't go down alone. Wait for me.
I'll help you down, okay?

02:06:03.057 --> 02:06:05.309
Where are her meds?

02:06:06.185 --> 02:06:07.686
In my bag.

02:06:08.938 --> 02:06:09.939
Good.

02:06:10.314 --> 02:06:11.732
What else?

02:06:48.894 --> 02:06:51.522
Let me know when you arrive.
I'll call you.

02:07:07.037 --> 02:07:08.038
Dad?

02:07:08.914 --> 02:07:10.040
What, honey?

02:07:10.749 --> 02:07:13.294
Why was it Paco
who came to get me?

02:07:35.107 --> 02:07:36.233
Goodbye.

02:07:37.276 --> 02:07:38.944
Be good.

02:07:46.702 --> 02:07:47.828
Take care.

02:08:02.509 --> 02:08:03.510
Goodbye.

02:08:36.085 --> 02:08:37.336
Let's go home.

02:08:41.173 --> 02:08:42.299
Sit down,

02:08:43.258 --> 02:08:44.635
I want to talk to you.

02:08:45.344 --> 02:08:46.970
It's cold, let's go home.

02:08:47.179 --> 02:08:48.180
Fernando...

02:09:02.569 --> 02:09:03.570
Sit down.
