Dexter: Sheesh.
I cannot believe

00:45.266 --> 00:49.033
the hogwash that passes
for television programming.

00:49.066 --> 00:50.183
Hogwash, hogwash,
hogwash.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.400
Hmm...
<i>When science goes wrong.</i>

00:53.433 --> 00:55.083
Ha. Not likely.

00:55.116 --> 00:56.400
Let's see. Let's see...

[Gasp]

Dad, dad, dad,
dad, dad!

01:00.200 --> 01:03.033
Look, dad!
Take a look
at this, dad!

Hey, dad!

Hey, dad!

01:12.083 --> 01:15.200
Aah! What's a--
who? What?

01:15.233 --> 01:16.216
Uh...

01:16.250 --> 01:18.366
<i>"The parasite within"?</i>

01:18.400 --> 01:20.116
So, what do
you say, pops?

01:20.150 --> 01:22.066
Can I stay up
and watch it?

01:22.100 --> 01:23.450
Please?

01:23.483 --> 01:24.400
Hmm...

01:24.433 --> 01:25.433
I'm sorry, Dexter,

01:25.466 --> 01:27.466
but a movie
like that, well--

01:28.000 --> 01:30.116
well, it's just
too downright scary

01:30.150 --> 01:31.466
for a boy of your age.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.033
It's all
mathematics, son.

01:34.066 --> 01:37.066
[Snoring and mumbling]

01:42.316 --> 01:43.466
Oh, that father of mine.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.483
He can be a real pain
in the medulla oblongata.

01:48.016 --> 01:49.216
All because of him,

01:49.250 --> 01:54.100
I never get to do
anything fun--ever!

01:54.133 --> 01:55.150
Hmph!

01:55.183 --> 01:56.433
Well, I'll show him.

01:56.466 --> 02:00.200
Whilst the rest
of the household is tucked away

02:00.233 --> 02:02.350
into the nighty
of the night,

02:02.383 --> 02:05.316
I, Dexter,
boy sneakiness,

02:05.350 --> 02:11.083
will pay witness to
<i>the parasite within.</i>

02:11.116 --> 02:14.000
A-ha ha ha ha ha!

02:14.033 --> 02:17.233
Gee, hon, perhaps
I was a bit too hard
on the boy.

02:17.266 --> 02:21.200
Maybe we should just
let him watch his
silly old movie.

02:21.233 --> 02:23.483
And I'll even
watch it with him.

02:24.016 --> 02:26.016
Oh, I don't
think so, dear.

02:26.050 --> 02:29.000
You know what those
scary movies do to you.

02:29.033 --> 02:30.116
But, honey, i--

02:30.150 --> 02:32.400
[screaming]
Nobody's going
to watch the movie!

02:32.433 --> 02:36.083
[Singsong]
And that's final.

02:36.116 --> 02:39.116
Yes, dear.

T.v.: And now,
prepare to be terrified

02:56.233 --> 02:59.050
beyond the realm
of consciousness,

02:59.083 --> 03:02.033
as the scary network
presents...

03:02.066 --> 03:04.416
<i>The parasite within.</i>

Oh, no. Look out, Bob!

03:08.350 --> 03:12.116
Behind you!
It's the parasite!

03:12.150 --> 03:14.300
Bob! No!

03:14.333 --> 03:16.316
Bob: Sue, will you
quit worrying?

03:16.350 --> 03:18.133
Aah!

03:18.166 --> 03:21.333
It's eating me!
It's eating me!

03:21.366 --> 03:23.450
Aah!

[Yawning]

03:26.016 --> 03:27.033
Mmm...man.

03:27.066 --> 03:31.216
Oh, boy, do I have
a case of the snackies.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.150
Bob: Aah!
All is doomed!

03:36.183 --> 03:38.450
Help!
Oh, my insides!

03:38.483 --> 03:44.166
Oh, I'm being consumed
from the interior of me!

03:44.200 --> 03:46.016
Well, I'll be.

03:46.050 --> 03:49.050
If it isn't the chip
off the old block.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.366
Sue:
Beware, townspeople.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.366
That parasite
is a devious one.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.116
Its appetite for flesh
is insatiable!

03:56.150 --> 03:57.400
Wait, look!

03:57.433 --> 03:58.450
There, behind you!

03:58.483 --> 04:01.433
It's the parasite!

04:01.466 --> 04:03.200
Aah!

04:03.233 --> 04:06.050
Man: It's devouring
the whole village!

04:06.083 --> 04:08.400
Run for your lives!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
That's it.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.066
The parasite
has eaten everyone.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.150
Everyone except...

04:15.183 --> 04:16.316
Oh, no.

04:16.350 --> 04:18.216
The parasite's
inside me!

04:18.250 --> 04:21.350
It's...inside...me!

04:21.383 --> 04:23.366
Aah!

04:27.483 --> 04:28.400
Heh heh heh.

04:28.433 --> 04:31.233
That wasn't
really that scary.

04:31.266 --> 04:32.050
Ha ha ha.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.183
Look out, Dexter!

04:33.216 --> 04:37.050
I'm the parasite,
and I'm gonna eat
your flesh!

04:37.083 --> 04:39.100
Ha ha ha ha!

04:39.133 --> 04:41.416
Gotcha, Dexter!

04:42.450 --> 04:44.200
Dexter?

04:45.366 --> 04:46.350
Hey, come on, son.

04:46.383 --> 04:48.316
I--i was
just joshing.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.066
Dexter? Son?

04:50.100 --> 04:52.183
Snap out of it, boy!

04:52.216 --> 04:54.000
Come on, d-man!

Wake up
for d-papa, huh?

04:57.183 --> 04:59.416
[Sobbing]

05:02.316 --> 05:06.283
I told you that movie
would be too scary.

05:06.316 --> 05:08.316
For your
information, father,

05:08.350 --> 05:10.333
the movie
did not scare me.

05:10.366 --> 05:12.283
And neither did
your feeble attempts

05:12.316 --> 05:14.116
to scare me
scare me.

05:14.150 --> 05:15.316
And now, not
having been scared,

05:15.350 --> 05:18.316
I wish to be
put down so I
may return to bed.

05:18.350 --> 05:19.300
Thank you.

05:19.333 --> 05:22.400
All right.
Cool your britches, son.

how about we just go on
up to bed, then, huh?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.266
Come on, Dex.
This is your chance

05:41.300 --> 05:44.300
to taste the thrill
of real manhood.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.216
Now taste it!

05:48.233 --> 05:49.216
What do you see,
Dexter?

05:49.250 --> 05:50.183
Nothing.
I see nothing.

this was my house.

that my dad can
beat up your dad.

Dexter:
Dad! Dad...

15:15.233 --> 15:18.366
Now, you know I don't
condone the use
of parental names

15:18.400 --> 15:21.133
for the sake
of societal conformity.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.416
Sorry.
Ah-hem.

Mandark wasn't
being very nice.

He was mean,
and he called me

15:29.066 --> 15:30.450
a whole lot
of bad names.

15:30.483 --> 15:33.150
Then he tried to
hurt me, and he
pushed me around.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.266
He wouldn't
let up.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.250
He just kept
coming after me.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.300
Then he tried
to blast me

15:37.333 --> 15:38.316
with lasers
and missiles.

15:38.350 --> 15:41.216
But fortunately,
I was too quick.

15:42.266 --> 15:44.366
Now listen carefully,
young soul.

frog jumps in.

15:48.416 --> 15:49.333
Splash.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.400
Look, Dexter,
kids are stupid.

15:51.433 --> 15:54.133
They do idiotic things
for no reason at all.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.100
And then
they go to prison.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.200
And then
mandark said

15:57.233 --> 15:59.433
that his dad could
kick your butt!

15:59.466 --> 16:00.483
He said what?

16:01.016 --> 16:03.133
The ability to talk
your problems through

16:03.166 --> 16:04.283
will be
the biggest asset

16:04.316 --> 16:05.283
to the wholeness
of your soul

16:05.316 --> 16:07.216
and the approach
to manhood.

and get this
over with.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.233
Ha ha...
Ha ha...

16:20.266 --> 16:24.400
So, I hear there's
some animosity between
our two sons.

16:24.433 --> 16:27.350
Yeah, seems
like they're not
getting along.

16:27.383 --> 16:30.233
Well, boys will
be boys.

16:30.266 --> 16:31.416
So true to life.

16:31.450 --> 16:35.400
I always say that
the path to manhood
isn't straight;

16:35.433 --> 16:37.016
it's bumpy and rough

16:37.050 --> 16:39.116
with experiences
at every curve,

16:39.150 --> 16:43.000
but there's always
a river of life
at the end.

16:43.033 --> 16:43.433
Huh?

16:43.466 --> 16:45.016
Well, uh...

16:45.050 --> 16:46.466
I think you owe
Dexter an apology.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.400
That's right.
Say you're
sorry, son.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.233
Sorry.
Sorry.

16:54.283 --> 16:57.166
Now, that wasn't
too painful, huh?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.283
Our saplings are
turning into trees.

16:59.316 --> 17:00.416
I'm always
telling Dexter

17:00.450 --> 17:04.216
that there's
no use in calling
someone bad names

17:04.250 --> 17:05.466
or getting
into fights.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.266
And to think that
our blessed ones said

17:08.300 --> 17:11.116
that we would
resort to violence.

17:11.150 --> 17:13.100
How childish
and silly.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.200
I mean,
you beat me up?

17:14.233 --> 17:17.366
The only thing
you beat is
a different drum.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.400
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha.

17:20.433 --> 17:23.400
Gosh, what do
you hippies know
about violence?

17:23.433 --> 17:26.266
Don't you
oppose war

17:26.300 --> 17:28.250
or something
senseless
like that?

17:28.283 --> 17:30.350
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.183
Aren't you...
Republican?

17:32.216 --> 17:34.283
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha.

17:34.316 --> 17:36.283
Where do you get
your muscles from?

17:36.316 --> 17:37.283
Tofu?

17:37.316 --> 17:39.266
Now, that's
a nutritious
staple.

17:39.300 --> 17:42.016
You'd
be surprised--
meat eater.

17:42.050 --> 17:43.433
And let me
guess--yoga.

17:43.466 --> 17:46.050
You and those
stretches are
mighty tough.

17:46.083 --> 17:50.100
Well, I didn't know
corporate lemmings
could throw a punch.

17:50.133 --> 17:51.450
I didn't know
girlie sandals

17:51.483 --> 17:53.483
were conductive
to fighting!

17:54.016 --> 17:54.433
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:54.466 --> 17:56.483
Is that so?!
Yeah!

17:57.016 --> 17:58.150
Yeah?
Yeah!

17:58.183 --> 18:01.033
Well--
in that case...

18:01.183 --> 18:04.000
Oh...
The peace sign?

18:04.033 --> 18:06.133
Well,
i--i don't know
what to say--

18:06.166 --> 18:07.416
[thwat]

18:09.433 --> 18:14.166
Why don't
you give more money
to the government?

18:14.200 --> 18:17.083
Why don't you
wear a little more
patchouli?

18:17.116 --> 18:20.300
They can't smell it
in China.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.000
Hey,
where do you think
you're going?

18:23.033 --> 18:24.433
Come back here!

18:26.183 --> 18:28.100
Don't wanna fight
like a real man?

18:28.133 --> 18:30.000
Uh!

18:30.033 --> 18:31.366
Ham on rye.

18:31.400 --> 18:36.150
Now, that's low--
real low!

18:37.483 --> 18:40.466
I'm just
getting started.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.033
[Sizzle]

18:44.066 --> 18:47.383
Where'd that
tree-hugger go?

18:47.416 --> 18:51.466
Oh! Hot! Hot meat!
Hot meat! Get it off!
Get it off!

18:52.000 --> 18:55.433
No pain, no gain,
meat eater.

19:05.150 --> 19:06.333
Huh?

19:08.400 --> 19:11.383
Get a haircut,
why don't you?

19:12.250 --> 19:13.266
Nature boy!

19:13.300 --> 19:14.450
Cubicle worker!

19:14.483 --> 19:17.116
Granola eater!
Voter!

19:19.366 --> 19:22.483
Get back here!
Come back!

19:38.383 --> 19:41.016
I'm gonna
catch up with you.

19:41.050 --> 19:43.100
Oh, yeah? And then
what are you gonna--

19:43.133 --> 19:44.050
[splat]

19:44.083 --> 19:45.066
Are you crazy?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.166
You just threw
a duck at me!

19:47.200 --> 19:49.466
[Quack]
[Quack]

19:54.233 --> 19:56.116
[Quacking]

20:00.066 --> 20:06.016
I have had enough
of your duck-throwing
for one afternoon!

20:18.150 --> 20:21.483
Hey! We're not
done here!

20:22.016 --> 20:25.116
Hmm...
Maybe we are.

20:26.233 --> 20:27.466
Wait up!

20:29.133 --> 20:31.016
Come back!

20:43.450 --> 20:47.033
It's over,
crystal gazer.

20:47.066 --> 20:50.316
You are gonna
get it, lemming!

20:57.050 --> 20:59.033
Grr!
Grr!

21:16.333 --> 21:17.366
Wow...

21:17.400 --> 21:21.416
I guess our dads
are a pretty
equal match.

21:21.450 --> 21:24.116
Yeah.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.416
But I bet my mom
can beat up your mom.

21:26.450 --> 21:30.183
Yeah? Well, I bet
that my mom can
beat up your mom.

21:30.216 --> 21:31.300
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

21:31.333 --> 21:33.150
Yeah, well, I bet
my mom can beat up
your mom.

21:33.183 --> 21:34.483
Oh, yeah,
you pseudo
scientist!

21:35.016 --> 21:36.116
Quasi
nuclear physicist!

21:36.150 --> 21:37.133
Helium head!

21:37.166 --> 21:38.050
Shortstop!

21:38.083 --> 21:39.216
Quantum quack!
Science boy!

21:39.250 --> 21:41.250
You're a true
lame-brain!
