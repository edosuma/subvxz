00:46.878 --> 00:50.379
Oh! White Christmas.

01:01.226 --> 01:03.293
It's been so long.

01:03.295 --> 01:05.129
I forgot
what it felt like.

01:05.131 --> 01:07.667
Life is wasted
on the living.

01:11.403 --> 01:14.207
Oh, you don't even know
what you got.

01:28.254 --> 01:29.689
What are you doing
after the party?

01:34.393 --> 01:36.793
- Oh, you're the boss.
- I'm the boss!

01:36.795 --> 01:38.397
Yes!

01:55.346 --> 01:56.612
Hey, hey.

01:56.614 --> 01:58.481
Let me just
hop in here, Hal.

01:58.483 --> 02:00.484
Pour ourselves a drink.

02:00.486 --> 02:02.421
Could use one.

02:04.656 --> 02:05.955
Didn't make my quarter
this year.

02:05.957 --> 02:08.127
Probably not going
to make it.

02:09.594 --> 02:12.328
Oh, yeah.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.600
Not for lack of trying,
though.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.534
Bud stole my leads.

02:17.536 --> 02:19.235
- You're the boss.
- I'm the boss.

02:19.237 --> 02:21.370
Oh, you're the boss.

02:21.372 --> 02:22.972
He actually...
he gave them to me

02:22.974 --> 02:24.710
and then he took them
right back.

02:26.745 --> 02:28.448
Took them back.

02:28.813 --> 02:30.380
Yeah.

02:33.786 --> 02:35.788
God, I hate cold corn.

02:38.556 --> 02:40.389
Bud-oostie, huh?

02:40.391 --> 02:43.859
He's boffing his secretary while
he's got a wife at home.

02:43.861 --> 02:46.532
Oh, yeah, boss baby. Oh, yeah.

02:47.265 --> 02:48.600
I hate this job.

03:02.413 --> 03:03.682
Mrs. Elwood.

03:04.449 --> 03:05.817
Did you know?

03:07.686 --> 03:10.355
Look, I hate him just as much
as you do, trust me.

03:12.424 --> 03:14.558
Oh, I doubt it.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.329
Oh, no, no, please, please!

03:25.437 --> 03:27.436
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, Bud!

03:28.706 --> 03:30.776
Your wife's here.

03:34.712 --> 03:37.382
None of you can be trusted!

03:39.985 --> 03:41.885
None of you.

04:35.841 --> 04:37.276
Yeah...

04:46.084 --> 04:48.787
- I'm the boss, baby.
- Oh, you're the boss.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.788
Oh, I'm so fucking close.

05:32.831 --> 05:35.565
Oh, yeah, you're the boss!

05:35.567 --> 05:37.000
I'm the boss!

05:38.670 --> 05:40.372
Oh!

05:40.939 --> 05:42.805
Oh, jeez...

05:42.807 --> 05:44.444
You're not the man
I married.

05:50.649 --> 05:52.985
This place has changed you.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.519
Are you fucking nuts?

05:56.521 --> 05:58.457
Stay right where you are.

06:02.593 --> 06:04.594
Holly, honey,

06:04.596 --> 06:06.062
- I can explain...
- Shut up.

06:06.064 --> 06:09.565
You can't talk your way
out of this one.

06:09.567 --> 06:10.901
Please, I'm sorry!

06:10.903 --> 06:12.668
Apology accepted.

06:22.848 --> 06:24.650
I still love you.

06:35.593 --> 06:38.630
Every minute with you
has been a shrieking hell.

10:33.097 --> 10:35.864
When they said sisters,
I thought they meant

10:35.866 --> 10:37.767
a pair of nuns.

10:37.769 --> 10:39.435
No, sir, we're blood.

10:39.437 --> 10:42.008
I'm René,
this is Georgette.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.211
Can you help my daughter?

10:46.211 --> 10:48.180
We're the only ones
who can.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.056
It's best if
you wait outside.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.733
- Well, what can I do?
- Pray.

11:49.841 --> 11:51.310
She looks sick.

11:51.976 --> 11:54.143
She is sick.

11:54.145 --> 11:55.911
No, like she needs a doctor.

11:55.913 --> 11:58.350
You wanted to be a part
of the family business?

11:58.984 --> 12:00.382
Yeah.

12:00.384 --> 12:02.321
Then do like Grandma
taught us.

12:09.326 --> 12:10.962
Get her feet.

12:14.966 --> 12:16.331
Get her feet.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.967
Fine!

12:37.054 --> 12:38.588
Be ready.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.290
We'll trap it
with this.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.826
It's holy.

12:52.336 --> 12:56.040
I'm speaking to the entity
within this girl.

12:59.043 --> 13:01.980
This body is not yours.

13:06.183 --> 13:09.855
Leave now, or be trapped here
for all eternity.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.460
I will kill you.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.532
Please. I need a doctor.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.435
Please.

13:31.576 --> 13:34.109
Please. Help me.

13:34.111 --> 13:35.344
I need a doctor.

13:35.346 --> 13:37.247
Quick, the box.

13:37.249 --> 13:38.281
Give me the box.

13:38.283 --> 13:40.148
We should stop.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.020
It's too late.

13:43.053 --> 13:44.456
Please.

13:53.163 --> 13:54.998
Be gone!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.934
Be gone! Be gone!

13:59.203 --> 14:00.572
Don't break the circle.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.109
Don't break the circle.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.478
Georgette! Georgette!

14:24.528 --> 14:27.397
- So they're making this all up.
- I just want to finish.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.565
Are you calling
these people liars?

14:31.035 --> 14:32.535
I'm just saying they're
misinformed.

14:32.537 --> 14:34.938
Ah, misinformed.
If you're just joining us,

14:34.940 --> 14:37.105
welcome Georgette DuBois,

14:37.107 --> 14:38.473
professional skeptic.

14:38.475 --> 14:41.009
A new book,
<i>The Irrational God,</i>

14:41.011 --> 14:42.945
DuBois reveals a softer side.

14:42.947 --> 14:44.479
The book covers
her childhood,

14:44.481 --> 14:47.583
including her own
struggles with faith,

14:47.585 --> 14:50.085
and her discovery of science.

14:50.087 --> 14:53.690
She became famous for her
pioneering work in psychology.

14:53.692 --> 14:56.291
But these days,
her reputation stems mostly

14:56.293 --> 15:00.997
from her crusade against faith
healers and psychic mediums.

15:00.999 --> 15:03.498
What I do is a little bit
more complicated than that.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.169
You're on a mission
against the faithful.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.704
I'm referring to your run-in
with Father Heaven Lee,

15:08.706 --> 15:10.238
the exorcist.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.708
Oh, you mean
Harrison Miller Lee,

15:11.710 --> 15:13.475
the indicted criminal.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.212
There are those that say
he cured them.

15:16.214 --> 15:17.579
He's a parasite.

15:17.581 --> 15:20.382
Aren't some things
beyond explanation?

15:20.384 --> 15:22.986
Don't some things
require faith?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.520
It's one thing not to know,

15:24.522 --> 15:26.321
but we can't stop
looking for answers.

15:26.323 --> 15:28.992
You know, in the 19th century,
the work of serial killers

15:28.994 --> 15:32.027
was mistaken for evidence
of werewolves or vampires.

15:32.029 --> 15:34.129
We have to confront
the ugly truths.

15:34.131 --> 15:36.031
We can't keep hiding
from reality

15:36.033 --> 15:38.233
in some well-meaning
fairy tale.

15:38.235 --> 15:40.236
Well, you're not
buying it.

15:40.238 --> 15:42.738
I have 100 years
of medicine on my side.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.306
If your loved one
is speaking in tongues,

15:44.308 --> 15:46.108
then they're probably
having a seizure,

15:46.110 --> 15:47.642
not a message from God.

15:47.644 --> 15:50.512
You're building a career
by tearing down the institutions

15:50.514 --> 15:53.483
and beliefs that are
important to millions.

15:53.485 --> 15:57.589
Do you ever feel your skepticism
is alienating, Miss DuBois?

15:58.655 --> 16:00.455
I've always been
the odd man out.

16:00.457 --> 16:02.660
Maybe you fit in
by being the odd man.

16:03.293 --> 16:05.161
Maybe.

16:05.163 --> 16:08.097
You come from a long line
of fortune-tellers and mediums.

16:08.099 --> 16:09.598
Do you not?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.535
Is this crusade something
more personal, perhaps?

16:12.537 --> 16:15.238
<i>Is this just an act of defiance
against your family?</i>

16:15.240 --> 16:17.172
<i>No, it's quite the opposite,
actually.</i>

16:17.174 --> 16:19.108
<i>Nothing would make me happier
than finding evidence</i>

16:19.110 --> 16:20.443
<i>of the supernatural.</i>

16:20.445 --> 16:22.078
<i>Stay right there.</i>

16:22.080 --> 16:23.482
<i>When we return,
we'll hear from...</i>

16:47.739 --> 16:49.638
You look lost.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.239
Oh.

16:51.241 --> 16:53.478
I don't believe
I'm in the right place.

16:54.678 --> 16:56.512
Well, where are you
supposed to be?

16:56.514 --> 16:59.051
Is this the American Building?

17:01.251 --> 17:05.423
I'm here about the disturbances.
I believe we spoke on the phone.

17:06.257 --> 17:08.391
Oh, yeah.

17:08.393 --> 17:10.461
Yeah, I barely recognized
your voice.

17:12.363 --> 17:16.101
There was a doggy barking
pretty loudly in the background.

17:18.403 --> 17:20.268
Yes, I...

17:20.270 --> 17:22.371
I have quite a few,
actually.

17:22.373 --> 17:23.638
Yes, me too.

17:23.641 --> 17:25.407
Can't help collecting strays.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.311
Well, everybody
needs a good home.

17:28.779 --> 17:31.213
You know, I couldn't
have said that better myself.

17:31.215 --> 17:36.619
This place was originally
an apartment complex.

17:36.621 --> 17:40.222
And then a hotel
for about a minute.

17:40.224 --> 17:42.693
And offices ever since.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.898
There was a time when more than
a thousand people

17:48.900 --> 17:51.269
walked through this lobby
every morning.

17:52.202 --> 17:54.705
Yup, those were the days.

17:56.473 --> 17:58.841
This is actually
my first office job.

18:01.311 --> 18:02.745
Okey-dokey.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.682
Should we start
with the crime scene?

18:05.349 --> 18:06.717
Yes, please.

18:53.364 --> 18:56.431
Now, Mrs. Elwood
shot Mr. Elwood

18:56.433 --> 18:58.269
right next to where
you're standing.

19:01.372 --> 19:03.509
And then she turned
the gun on herself.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.411
A crime of passion.

19:07.979 --> 19:09.480
I guess so.

19:20.758 --> 19:23.162
Smaller than I imagined.

19:25.762 --> 19:31.299
What do coffins
and condoms have in common?

19:31.301 --> 19:33.736
Um... I don't know.
What?

19:33.738 --> 19:35.874
They're both for stiffs.

19:41.011 --> 19:43.347
So, what's the power
situation up here?

19:44.816 --> 19:47.318
Still purrs like a pussycat.

19:48.853 --> 19:51.319
Be a dear and go throw
the switch

19:51.321 --> 19:52.924
in that box by the elevator.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.496
So is the activity
always concentrated

20:00.498 --> 20:02.301
around the holidays?

20:03.433 --> 20:04.834
Yeah.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.239
Christmas always seems
to bring bad luck.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.741
Let's see.

20:12.509 --> 20:15.344
I mean, the architect died
the day the building opened,

20:15.346 --> 20:18.280
back in December 24th, 1919.

20:18.282 --> 20:20.284
Elevator crash.

20:21.986 --> 20:24.420
Jeez, talk about a bad sign.

20:24.422 --> 20:26.956
Yeah. It gets worse.

20:26.958 --> 20:31.661
Let's see, there was
the suicide in '38.

20:31.663 --> 20:34.799
Arson in '54.

20:35.566 --> 20:37.935
Outbreak in '76.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.903
There were rumors
of a curse.

20:41.905 --> 20:43.639
The girls in the typing pool

20:43.641 --> 20:45.940
claimed to have seen
weird things.

20:45.942 --> 20:50.645
But it wasn't until
the massacre of '84

20:50.647 --> 20:52.948
that business really
dried up.

20:52.950 --> 20:56.786
So management is hoping
that you will help

20:56.788 --> 20:58.757
to put an end
to the ghost stories.

21:00.325 --> 21:03.592
Well, there's an explanation
for everything.

21:03.594 --> 21:06.398
I'll leave it to
the professionals, then.

21:06.931 --> 21:08.463
If you need me,

21:08.465 --> 21:09.798
I'm going to be doing
my rounds.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.601
I left you a hard hat
and a walkie.

21:12.603 --> 21:15.103
Don't be afraid to use
either one.

21:15.105 --> 21:17.573
I like to be left alone
as much as possible.

21:17.575 --> 21:20.278
Less chance of contamination.

21:20.845 --> 21:22.713
Fine by me.

21:28.519 --> 21:29.951
Merry Christmas.

21:29.953 --> 21:32.423
No, I'm not a Christian.

21:34.625 --> 21:35.894
Oh, well.

21:39.529 --> 21:40.898
Happy Solstice.

24:02.173 --> 24:05.143
Point-zero-zero-zero-two.

24:13.617 --> 24:16.619
Point-zero-zero-zero-two.

24:17.855 --> 24:21.092
Point-zero-zero-zero-two.

24:23.027 --> 24:26.631
Point-zero-zero-zero-two.

24:32.702 --> 24:34.569
EMF readings are normal.

24:34.571 --> 24:36.841
Background radiation
is normal.

24:37.708 --> 24:40.111
Alpha waves are normal.

24:45.215 --> 24:49.117
There's an unusual high level
of lead particles in the air,

24:49.119 --> 24:52.923
but that doesn't seem to be
uncommon for a building this...

24:55.226 --> 24:56.862
old.

25:00.330 --> 25:03.766
December 24th is reportedly
a very popular time of the year

25:03.768 --> 25:05.968
for this building's
hauntings.

25:05.970 --> 25:07.937
However, there doesn't seem
to be any evidence

25:07.939 --> 25:10.542
to support those claims.

25:18.348 --> 25:21.816
This case is reminiscent
of Loup City, Nebraska.

25:21.818 --> 25:25.754
Turned out to be a raccoon
nesting in the ceiling.

25:25.756 --> 25:27.125
Hmm.

25:31.695 --> 25:33.764
I really hope
it's not a raccoon.

26:05.762 --> 26:06.964
Hmm.

26:13.703 --> 26:15.105
It's real sugar!

26:15.705 --> 26:16.774
Huh!

27:19.869 --> 27:21.969
<i>Hi, you've reached René.</i>

27:21.971 --> 27:23.471
<i>Leave a message.</i>

27:23.473 --> 27:25.440
Hey.

27:25.442 --> 27:27.077
Hey, it's me.

27:28.479 --> 27:30.649
I haven't called in a while.

27:31.882 --> 27:34.085
At least not since last year.

27:35.452 --> 27:38.420
I'm actually in town
on business.

27:38.422 --> 27:41.422
It's crazy how this town
stays the same.

27:41.424 --> 27:45.059
I saw Pete down on 9th Street
selling Christmas trees.

27:45.061 --> 27:48.932
That guy's got to be, like,
a million years old by now.

27:50.166 --> 27:52.167
What does he sell
in the summertime?

27:52.169 --> 27:53.869
Palm trees?

27:57.907 --> 27:59.843
I know, I know,
it's corny.

28:00.911 --> 28:02.413
But I bet you laughed.

28:06.784 --> 28:08.153
Anyways, um...

28:09.753 --> 28:12.321
just wanted to wish
you a Merry Christmas,

28:12.323 --> 28:14.092
and...

28:16.493 --> 28:18.096
and I miss you.

29:37.307 --> 29:39.510
<i>Quit playing with the lights.</i>

29:42.346 --> 29:44.481
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

29:46.983 --> 29:49.220
<i>For your own safety.
I'm not trying to hassle you.</i>

29:50.320 --> 29:52.019
No, no, you're right.

29:52.021 --> 29:53.357
I'll be more careful.

30:31.595 --> 30:32.963
Eww.

30:36.066 --> 30:37.836
God.

30:46.609 --> 30:49.880
Hello? Is...
is someone out there?

30:54.984 --> 30:56.250
Hello?

30:56.252 --> 30:58.388
Is there someone there?

32:30.213 --> 32:31.950
Sure, why not?

32:37.121 --> 32:38.423
Hmm.

32:56.272 --> 32:58.442
All right,
what do we got?

33:10.421 --> 33:12.557
Oh, buddy,
what happened to you?

33:52.261 --> 33:53.530
Now what?

34:10.146 --> 34:11.782
Oh, God, stop!

34:13.282 --> 34:14.551
Stop!

34:34.471 --> 34:36.474
Come on, come on, come on.

34:59.195 --> 35:01.199
Come on, where are you?

35:06.869 --> 35:09.574
What is that?

35:24.253 --> 35:25.655
Wait.

35:32.329 --> 35:33.397
Oh!

35:39.202 --> 35:40.471
Fuck.

36:07.697 --> 36:10.664
I think we have a problem here.

36:16.773 --> 36:19.507
I think... I think
we have a bad connection.

36:19.509 --> 36:21.778
If you can hear me,
the power is out.

36:23.413 --> 36:24.679
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

36:24.681 --> 36:26.583
<i>I'll see if...</i>

36:28.351 --> 36:29.650
Come again?

36:33.289 --> 36:34.458
Hello?

36:39.262 --> 36:40.530
Come on.

37:26.510 --> 37:27.845
Hello?

37:43.427 --> 37:45.492
You know, technically
this is trespassing,

37:45.494 --> 37:47.431
and I will call the police.

38:17.059 --> 38:18.663
Hello?

38:31.541 --> 38:33.611
Hey, I'm talking to you.

38:47.423 --> 38:48.858
Excuse me.

41:49.639 --> 41:51.039
<i>Hello?</i>

41:51.041 --> 41:52.840
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

41:52.842 --> 41:54.979
Yes, I can hear you.

41:55.778 --> 41:57.514
<i>Please help me.</i>

41:59.114 --> 42:02.583
Who is this?
What's happening to you?

42:02.585 --> 42:04.619
<i>There's something...</i>

42:04.621 --> 42:07.956
<i>th-th-there's something
behind my eyes.</i>

42:07.958 --> 42:09.923
Where are you calling from?

42:09.925 --> 42:13.596
<i>Send help to the American
Building, Apartment 1106.</i>

42:15.097 --> 42:17.197
No, no. I'm...

42:17.199 --> 42:19.002
I'm the only person
here tonight.

42:20.836 --> 42:23.771
This building's been vacant
for almost 30 years now.

42:25.842 --> 42:29.309
<i>Oh, God, I can feel it
crawling inside of me.</i>

42:29.311 --> 42:30.878
Just breathe.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.880
<i>I see what it sees.</i>

42:32.882 --> 42:34.882
<i>Make it stop!</i>

42:34.884 --> 42:36.617
<i>Make it stop!</i>

42:36.619 --> 42:38.621
<i>Make it stop!</i>

42:39.789 --> 42:41.054
<i>I'm going to cut it out.</i>

42:41.056 --> 42:43.023
No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

42:43.025 --> 42:45.959
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can last.</i>

42:45.961 --> 42:49.630
<i>There's something inside of me.</i>

42:49.632 --> 42:51.999
<i>It's...</i>

42:53.802 --> 42:55.403
<i>it's an angel.</i>

42:55.405 --> 42:57.371
<i>It's an...</i>

42:57.373 --> 42:58.875
Hello?

43:04.114 --> 43:06.016
Are you still there?

43:13.356 --> 43:15.292
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

43:16.092 --> 43:17.791
<i>It stopped.</i>

43:17.793 --> 43:18.959
<i>I think it...</i>

43:41.150 --> 43:42.952
Oh!

44:27.963 --> 44:29.365
No.

44:41.277 --> 44:42.275
No.

44:42.277 --> 44:43.813
No, no, no.

44:55.324 --> 44:56.859
What?

45:29.958 --> 45:31.194
What?

45:34.963 --> 45:36.733
This can't be right.

45:49.978 --> 45:51.748
Plan B.

46:09.264 --> 46:10.900
What?

46:18.340 --> 46:20.243
Come on, come on, come on.

46:21.476 --> 46:23.246
Please.

46:44.032 --> 46:45.967
No.

46:45.969 --> 46:47.436
Oh, God, no.

50:56.385 --> 50:58.422
They don't make them
like this anymore.

52:04.353 --> 52:07.720
To the entity that resides
in this building...

52:07.722 --> 52:09.492
I call to you.

52:39.588 --> 52:41.490
Come on, answer me.

53:03.913 --> 53:06.449
I demand to know
who I'm talking to.

53:24.599 --> 53:26.435
You're not welcome here.

53:47.456 --> 53:48.856
By whom?

54:03.405 --> 54:05.574
What do you want from me?

54:31.500 --> 54:32.965
No! No!

54:47.115 --> 54:48.550
No!

54:50.452 --> 54:51.621
No!

54:58.427 --> 54:59.796
Oh, God! Why?

55:02.465 --> 55:03.731
Help me!

55:03.733 --> 55:05.035
Help!

55:07.702 --> 55:09.806
Help! Help!

55:59.454 --> 56:01.588
<i>Ain't coming back!</i>

56:01.590 --> 56:06.427
<i>And if you ever read
the Book of Revelations,</i>

56:06.429 --> 56:09.965
<i>you know that we're
all insane.</i>

56:11.099 --> 56:12.900
<i>Other books move in behind.</i>

56:12.902 --> 56:15.802
<i>It's just not a book
that's fiction.</i>

56:15.804 --> 56:17.373
<i>It's a fact.</i>

56:18.840 --> 56:22.708
<i>And do you want
to be left alone</i>

56:22.710 --> 56:24.510
<i>on the earth
as we're all ascending?</i>

56:24.512 --> 56:26.615
Please... help me.

56:29.150 --> 56:30.516
Be gone.

56:30.518 --> 56:32.519
- Forget it! Be gone.
- Stop.

56:32.521 --> 56:34.121
Don't break the circle.

56:34.123 --> 56:35.458
Forget it!

56:36.625 --> 56:37.893
No!

59:02.271 --> 59:03.740
Oh, my God.

59:28.797 --> 59:30.065
Yes.

59:42.311 --> 59:43.780
Yes.

01:00:52.947 --> 01:00:54.650
Where...?

01:00:58.353 --> 01:01:02.892
Okay, so that satellite thing
is going to be the rooftop cap.

01:01:04.092 --> 01:01:05.761
And...

01:01:06.894 --> 01:01:08.898
what the hell is this?

01:01:16.137 --> 01:01:17.737
It's colder...

01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:20.072
gutters with cores
of pure...

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:26.715
It's a cage.

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:29.115
A cage for what?

01:01:29.117 --> 01:01:31.253
For something that's...

01:01:33.922 --> 01:01:35.724
For something
that's intangible.

01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:39.695
Oh, God.

01:01:42.063 --> 01:01:44.299
I'm in the heart
of a machine.

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.342
What?

01:02:04.786 --> 01:02:06.788
DuBois? What...?

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.425
<i>Let's see.</i>

01:02:12.427 --> 01:02:14.896
I mean, the architect died
the day the building opened.

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:19.999
Elevator crash.

01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:35.751
<i>Let's see, there
was the suicide in '38.</i>

01:02:42.056 --> 01:02:43.358
Arson in '54.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.236
Outbreak in '76.

01:03:00.007 --> 01:03:03.610
<i>It wasn't until
the massacre of '84</i>

01:03:03.612 --> 01:03:06.014
- <i>that business really dried up.</i>
- <i>I'm the boss!</i>

01:03:17.192 --> 01:03:18.891
No! No!

01:03:22.364 --> 01:03:24.099
No! No.

01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:54.891
Okay.

01:05:02.597 --> 01:05:05.130
Ow! Fuck!

01:05:05.132 --> 01:05:06.499
Oh!

01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:07.937
Fuck!

01:05:09.103 --> 01:05:10.135
Fuck.

01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:32.662
Ow.

01:05:33.728 --> 01:05:35.260
Aah!

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:38.668
Ow!

01:05:45.139 --> 01:05:46.442
Fuck!

01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:16.431
Aah!

01:07:19.867 --> 01:07:21.800
No!

01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:08.640
No!

01:10:04.332 --> 01:10:06.432
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

01:10:06.434 --> 01:10:08.500
where they may be gone from us.

01:10:08.502 --> 01:10:11.603
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
where they may be gone from us.

01:10:11.605 --> 01:10:13.373
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.874
where they may be gone from us.

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:20.412
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
where they may be gone from us.

01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:49.872
I messed up.

01:11:51.706 --> 01:11:54.310
I'm in over my head.

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:57.813
Like always.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.914
Do you remember Shadow?

01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:04.052
I don't know what made me
think of her.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.821
That dog was scared
of everything.

01:12:08.823 --> 01:12:11.758
She would bark at everyone
that came near her,

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.564
and howl every single time
we left her home alone.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:21.337
It took enough just to get her
outside by herself.

01:12:23.037 --> 01:12:25.841
But she was brave
in her own way.

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:31.977
Even in the end,

01:12:31.979 --> 01:12:34.649
she was too stupid
to just roll over and die.

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:39.020
We had to put her down.
Remember?

01:12:41.588 --> 01:12:43.024
I didn't cry.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.360
We knew.

01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:50.865
I knew that she would
be going to a better place.

01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:56.738
But when I lost you...

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.447
...everything changed.

01:13:07.448 --> 01:13:11.386
And I was so scared
that after all of this,

01:13:11.985 --> 01:13:14.088
there was nothing.

01:13:23.497 --> 01:13:25.733
I really wish you were here
right now.

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.539
You would know
what to do.

01:13:34.108 --> 01:13:36.110
You always did.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:43.118
What would you do?

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.855
What would you do?

01:14:47.715 --> 01:14:49.618
What is that?

01:15:17.612 --> 01:15:19.081
Oh, God.

01:15:40.134 --> 01:15:41.933
White Christmas.

01:15:41.935 --> 01:15:43.704
What the fuck?

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:50.278
It's been too long.

01:15:52.846 --> 01:15:54.983
I forgot what it felt like.

01:16:01.221 --> 01:16:03.692
Life is wasted
on the living.

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.230
You don't even know
what you've got.

01:16:12.033 --> 01:16:14.236
What do coffins and condoms
have in common?

01:16:16.804 --> 01:16:18.103
What?

01:16:18.105 --> 01:16:19.738
They're both for stiffs.

01:16:28.649 --> 01:16:30.318
I'm the boss.

01:16:32.052 --> 01:16:33.818
I'm the boss.

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.923
I'm the boss.

01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:40.393
You're not the man
I married.

01:16:41.828 --> 01:16:43.995
This place has changed you.

01:16:43.997 --> 01:16:45.830
Stay right where you are!

01:16:45.832 --> 01:16:47.199
Shut up!

01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:49.101
You can't talk your way
out of this one.

01:16:50.938 --> 01:16:53.641
Apology accepted.

01:16:57.078 --> 01:16:59.247
I still love you!

01:17:01.015 --> 01:17:03.049
It's time.

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.785
Stop. Don't come any closer.

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.322
I know what you are.

01:17:09.023 --> 01:17:11.860
You're evil,
and this place is your prison.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.994
Blood of your blood
chained me here.

01:17:14.996 --> 01:17:17.763
But tonight,
the longest night,

01:17:17.765 --> 01:17:19.865
I'll soon be flesh.

01:17:19.867 --> 01:17:21.400
You're cursed.

01:17:21.402 --> 01:17:23.001
Yes.

01:17:23.003 --> 01:17:25.006
And you are my salvation.

01:17:25.972 --> 01:17:27.643
I won't help you.

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.847
You already have.

01:17:49.896 --> 01:17:51.399
No.

01:17:55.903 --> 01:17:58.673
Aah! Aah!

01:18:14.221 --> 01:18:15.791
No.

01:18:44.452 --> 01:18:47.152
What are you going
to do to me?

01:18:48.823 --> 01:18:49.988
I need a body.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.460
It's the only way out.

01:18:56.296 --> 01:18:58.065
No. No.

01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:23.188
Father will become son.

01:19:26.426 --> 01:19:28.262
Son becomes the father.

01:19:42.109 --> 01:19:43.779
Be still.

01:19:44.578 --> 01:19:46.344
Be safe.

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:48.783
I'll protect you, Mother.

01:20:00.427 --> 01:20:01.930
Aah!

01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:25.220
No.

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:37.298
Your wickedness is being
burned away by my seed.

01:20:38.032 --> 01:20:40.499
Oh! Aah! No! No!

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:42.067
Oh, God!

01:20:57.551 --> 01:20:59.087
No.

01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:04.558
Soon, you will only know love
and devotion for your child.

01:21:13.634 --> 01:21:16.402
You will nurture me,

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:19.541
spiritually and physically...

01:21:21.007 --> 01:21:22.978
until I am strong enough.

01:21:24.377 --> 01:21:25.980
And then I...

01:21:27.581 --> 01:21:30.886
will care for you.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.321
He's an angel.

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.092
Submit.

01:21:37.591 --> 01:21:39.127
Surrender.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.563
And know peace.

01:21:49.369 --> 01:21:52.239
Help! Help me, somebody!
Please!

01:21:55.141 --> 01:21:56.510
No!

01:21:57.744 --> 01:21:59.611
Help. Somebody help me.

01:22:21.735 --> 01:22:24.338
Little monsters
fit in little boxes.

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.308
I'm a big fucking monster!

01:22:51.198 --> 01:22:52.467
Get away from there.

01:22:56.103 --> 01:22:57.568
What are you doing?

01:22:57.570 --> 01:22:59.140
Aah!

01:23:01.207 --> 01:23:03.041
Suicide's a sin.

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:11.215
You'll never see
your sister again.

01:23:14.721 --> 01:23:16.724
You'll never get
into heaven.

01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:26.667
You'll never get out
of hell.

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.573
No!

01:24:25.658 --> 01:24:28.559
Okay.
