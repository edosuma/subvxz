WEBVTT

00:08.102 --> 00:10.103
Another mystery bites the dust.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.204
Way to go, gang!

00:11.271 --> 00:12.505
Let's celebrate!

00:12.573 --> 00:14.674
Yeah. Celebrate.

00:14.742 --> 00:16.309
Better idea.

00:16.376 --> 00:18.611
Aw, come on, sheriff.

00:18.679 --> 00:21.047
Just cork it.
You see this badge?

00:21.115 --> 00:22.482
Know why it's here?

00:22.549 --> 00:23.716
It came with the shirt?

00:23.784 --> 00:26.586
It's here because if there's
a crime, I solve it.

00:29.089 --> 00:30.623
Oh, and by the way,

00:30.691 --> 00:32.191
I've called all your parents,

00:32.259 --> 00:34.694
who, by now,
I have on speed dial.

00:34.762 --> 00:37.196
Oh, are you in trouble.

00:37.264 --> 00:42.135
Especially you, fred.
Say hi to dad, the Mayor.

00:43.370 --> 00:44.604
Just once, it would be nice

00:44.671 --> 00:46.205
if someone thanked us
for solving a mystery.

00:46.273 --> 00:49.542
Good thing we're not
in this to be liked.

00:49.610 --> 00:52.345
Maybe that didn't
come out quite right.

00:56.990 --> 01:06.159

01:09.696 --> 01:12.231
Welcome to the
Crystal Cove haunted tour.

01:12.299 --> 01:14.600
I'm your ghoulish guide velma.

01:14.668 --> 01:17.603
The first documented case
of the curse of Crystal Cove

01:17.671 --> 01:19.272
is from 1630,

01:19.339 --> 01:21.441
when a garrison
of Spanish conquistadors

01:21.508 --> 01:23.609
mysteriously vanished
from the harbor.

01:23.677 --> 01:26.245
Oh, that is so scary!
Where did they go?

01:26.313 --> 01:29.182
What part of the word "mystery"
didn't you understand?

01:29.249 --> 01:31.684
The curse struck again in 1765

01:31.752 --> 01:34.854
when an entire town of
missionaries likewise disappeared.

01:36.423 --> 01:41.027
Anyway, things were pretty
quiet until 100 years later,

01:41.094 --> 01:42.695
when cletus darrow
found gold here

01:42.763 --> 01:45.198
and renamed the town
Crystal Cove.

01:46.433 --> 01:48.234
Most people thought the
curse had been lifted,

01:48.302 --> 01:51.070
until the entire darrow family
disappeared one Halloween

01:51.138 --> 01:54.740
and was never seen again.

01:56.977 --> 01:59.245
Moving on.

01:59.313 --> 02:01.914
Since the disappearance
of the darrow family,

02:01.982 --> 02:04.917
Crystal Cove has been a hub
of paranormal activity.

02:04.985 --> 02:08.086
You might recognize some of
our more famous visitors...

02:08.155 --> 02:10.656
ghostly deep sea diver
Captain cutler,

02:10.723 --> 02:12.758
miner '49er,

02:12.826 --> 02:14.594
Charlie the haunted robot,

02:14.661 --> 02:19.665
and who could forget the terrifying
stylings of space kook? Not me.

02:19.733 --> 02:21.334
Oh! How frightening!

02:21.401 --> 02:23.870
Oh! Absolutely
blood-curdling.

02:23.937 --> 02:26.973
Not really.
They all turned out to be fakes.

02:29.376 --> 02:33.479
Yep. Captain cutler was just some
guy who was hijacking boats.

02:33.547 --> 02:36.148
Miner '49er's real name
was Hank.

02:36.216 --> 02:38.150
Charlie belonged
to Mr. Jenkins,

02:38.218 --> 02:40.152
who thought it would be easier
to run an amusement park

02:40.220 --> 02:41.821
with a crazy robot.

02:41.889 --> 02:43.089
And space kook?

02:43.156 --> 02:45.157
Oh, don't get me started!

02:45.225 --> 02:47.159
Ooh!
Thank you, velma.

02:47.227 --> 02:50.263
Well, that concludes
the terror-ific tour.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.833
Don't forget to stop in at the
haunted snack shop for souvenirs

02:53.901 --> 02:56.335
and your complimentary
undead sipper cup.

02:58.238 --> 02:59.672
What do you think
you were doing?

02:59.740 --> 03:02.008
Are you trying to
destroy our business?

03:02.075 --> 03:04.844
Reboot, parentals.
I was just being honest.

03:04.912 --> 03:06.445
Those were isolated incidents

03:06.513 --> 03:09.015
in Crystal Cove's otherwise-unblemished
supernatural past

03:09.082 --> 03:10.783
of hauntings and
paranormal happenings.

03:10.851 --> 03:13.352
Your generation's belief,
not mine.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.522
My generation, we only got
one thing on our minds.

03:16.590 --> 03:18.424
Solving mysteries
and building traps.

03:18.492 --> 03:19.859
That's 2 things, fred.

03:19.927 --> 03:21.193
You know what I mean, dad.

03:21.261 --> 03:23.329
We just want answers.
Is that wrong?

03:23.397 --> 03:24.597
Tickling chin whiskers, fred.

03:24.665 --> 03:26.432
The Mayor's son is supposed
to set an example.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.834
I'm trying, dad.
In fact, just yesterday,

03:28.902 --> 03:30.169
I entered one of my traps

03:30.237 --> 03:31.504
in the district science fair.

03:31.572 --> 03:33.339
It was rejected
for not actually having

03:33.407 --> 03:34.707
anything to do
with science, but...

03:34.775 --> 03:36.909
I just don't want you to make
a mistake you'll regret.

03:36.977 --> 03:38.678
You mean like
making a bad trap?

03:38.745 --> 03:40.613
No!

03:40.681 --> 03:43.082
Life is not all about traps.
It's also about...

03:43.150 --> 03:44.750
pancakes.
And bacon.

03:44.818 --> 03:47.420
And sausages, and orange juice.

03:55.329 --> 03:57.330
Don't forget to chew....
And breathe.

03:58.165 --> 03:59.265
Mmm.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.167
Like, thanks, mom and dad.

04:01.234 --> 04:03.102
Yeah. Thanks,
mom and dad.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.037
Your mother and
I are worried about

04:05.105 --> 04:07.974
this mystery phase
you're going through.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.610
We're not saying find
new friends. We're...

04:10.677 --> 04:12.445
yes, we are.
Find new friends.

04:12.512 --> 04:15.615
Oh, you guys have got nothing
to worry about, man.

04:15.682 --> 04:17.683
Me and Scoob always
play it safe.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.452
If there's danger...

04:19.519 --> 04:22.488
We run, fast.
Really fast.

04:22.556 --> 04:23.923
And as for our friends,

04:23.991 --> 04:26.492
if you guys just gave them
a chance, you'd see...

04:26.560 --> 04:28.227
The gang is misunderstood.

04:28.295 --> 04:29.662
We're just solving mysteries.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.163
All the kids are doing it.

04:31.231 --> 04:33.599
No, they're not.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.268
And what about this fred Jones?

04:36.336 --> 04:38.337
Certainly,
there must be other boys.

04:38.405 --> 04:39.939
Not like fred.

04:40.007 --> 04:41.774
He's, like,
one of those geniuses

04:41.842 --> 04:43.843
that no one understands
until they're dead.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.344
He sees things different,

04:45.412 --> 04:48.447
and he wants to catch those
different things in his traps.

04:48.515 --> 04:51.450
Honey, we just want you to
go on to have a rich career,

04:51.518 --> 04:53.085
like your sisters.

04:56.423 --> 04:58.190
Oh, that's fred and the gang.
Got to go.

04:58.258 --> 04:59.425
Don't want to be
late for school.

04:59.493 --> 05:01.160
Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

05:01.228 --> 05:04.296
Bye, Daisy. Bye, dawn.
Bye, Dorothy. Bye, delilah.

05:07.634 --> 05:09.702
Hey, you sure
you guys don't want any

05:09.770 --> 05:11.537
of this Fruitmeier's smoothie?

05:11.605 --> 05:13.239
Oh, it's delic... aah!

05:13.306 --> 05:14.573
What the whoosit?

05:14.641 --> 05:15.741
Which one of you
broke that wall?

05:15.809 --> 05:17.543
We barely touched it.

05:20.414 --> 05:21.681
Is that another sewer?

05:21.748 --> 05:24.183
Impossible. There's only one
sewer, and we're in it.

05:24.251 --> 05:25.284
Unless...

05:25.352 --> 05:27.019
We've broken into
another dimension.

05:27.087 --> 05:28.854
No, idiot, we busted through to

05:28.922 --> 05:31.223
one of the old
Crystal Cove caves.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:46.039 --> 05:47.907
Huh?

05:47.974 --> 05:49.308
I think there's something in there.

05:49.376 --> 05:50.309
What should we do?

05:50.377 --> 05:52.311
Well, it's pretty clear,
isn't it?

05:52.379 --> 05:53.579
Those are radioactive symbols,

05:53.647 --> 05:55.981
meaning what's ever
inside is dangerous,

05:56.049 --> 05:57.516
meaning we need
to open it right away.

05:57.584 --> 06:00.219
Don't want what's ever in there
to mess up our schedule.

06:02.622 --> 06:03.723
Hey, I think I see something.

06:16.829 --> 06:18.630
Why didn't you
text me last night?

06:18.698 --> 06:19.865
I waited up for you.

06:19.932 --> 06:23.368
Um, like, me and
Scoob ordered a pizza,

06:23.436 --> 06:24.870
and then we just fell asleep

06:24.937 --> 06:26.905
watching a Vincent van ghoul movie.

06:26.973 --> 06:29.241
Ok. Apology accepted.

06:29.308 --> 06:31.143
But I still missed you.

06:32.712 --> 06:33.979
Not here.

06:34.046 --> 06:35.814
Velma, not in public.

06:35.882 --> 06:39.151
Why? Daphne and fred are going
to find out sooner or later.

06:39.218 --> 06:41.786
I'm not worried about them.
It's Scooby-Doo.

06:41.854 --> 06:43.989
He's my best friend.

06:44.056 --> 06:46.091
I want to break it
to him, like, gently.

06:46.159 --> 06:47.826
I'm just waiting
for the right time.

06:47.894 --> 06:49.561
How about now? Hey, Scooby!

07:12.418 --> 07:15.220
Zoiks! Like, what was that?

07:15.288 --> 07:16.621
It looks like a mystery to me.

07:16.689 --> 07:20.292
And I think that's just a little
more important than school.

07:28.968 --> 07:30.902
These are military...

07:30.970 --> 07:33.905
from the oxidation,
probably 30, 40 years old.

07:36.742 --> 07:38.743
Hey.

07:39.745 --> 07:41.346
Fred, I found something.

07:43.950 --> 07:45.717
Mmm.
Could be a clue.

07:45.785 --> 07:46.885
Good work, Daphne.

07:46.953 --> 07:48.320
Thanks, fred.

07:48.387 --> 07:50.455
You're so sweet.

07:51.691 --> 07:55.060
It's ok.
We can talk later. Heh.

07:57.196 --> 07:58.530
Hmm.

08:15.648 --> 08:17.148
All right, you see what happens

08:17.216 --> 08:20.619
when you kids stick your noses
where they don't belong?

08:20.686 --> 08:22.187
People get cocooned!

08:22.255 --> 08:24.189
Like, man,
we found them like that.

08:24.257 --> 08:25.790
Sheriff, there was a monster...

08:25.858 --> 08:27.459
quiet.
From this point forward,

08:27.526 --> 08:30.462
this is a crime scene

08:30.529 --> 08:32.297
and future tourist attraction.

08:32.365 --> 08:34.466
Stay out of it.

08:34.533 --> 08:36.467
I got his stay out of it right here.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.336
Let me talk to him.

08:38.404 --> 08:41.273
Don't worry.
Fred will make him understand.

08:42.607 --> 08:44.109
Shaggy, start the car.

08:44.176 --> 08:45.877
Wait. I thought you were
going to talk to him.

08:45.945 --> 08:47.545
He wasn't in a listening mood.

08:47.613 --> 08:48.913
So you stole a body?

08:48.981 --> 08:50.348
Rockin'.

08:53.452 --> 08:56.621
Don't worry.
I know just who can help us.

08:56.689 --> 08:59.024
All right.

08:59.091 --> 09:02.327
Who can tell me
what photosynthesis is?

09:03.629 --> 09:07.532
And please,
don't say "plant farts."

09:10.803 --> 09:12.804
Huh?
Professor Raffalo?

09:12.872 --> 09:14.472
We need your help.

09:16.809 --> 09:20.378
Couldn't you kids
have waited for break?

09:22.882 --> 09:24.849
Is he...

09:24.917 --> 09:27.719
No. He's alive.

09:27.787 --> 09:32.157
But he appears to be in some
sort of dehydrated stasis.

09:32.224 --> 09:33.758
I don't quite know
what that means,

09:33.826 --> 09:36.061
but I'm guessing
it's temporary.

09:36.128 --> 09:39.864
Mmm.
Scooby snacks.

09:44.003 --> 09:45.603
Do you know
what could have done this?

09:45.671 --> 09:48.707
The cocoon
material looks organic,

09:48.774 --> 09:51.943
but I'll need to do
further tests.

09:52.011 --> 09:53.845
The sheriff okayed this?

09:53.913 --> 09:55.680
Uh, of course he did.

09:55.748 --> 09:58.049
What, do you think
we stole a body?

09:58.117 --> 10:01.252
That's...
that's rich. Ha ha.

10:03.589 --> 10:06.424
Welcome, everyone,
to Fruitmeier's.

10:06.492 --> 10:08.860
Remember, it's not ice cream.
It's not yogurt.

10:08.928 --> 10:10.762
Ha! I really don't know
what it is.

10:10.830 --> 10:13.398
Would anyone like a shrimping
boat made out of circus balloons?

10:13.466 --> 10:15.633
I don't get it

10:15.701 --> 10:17.702
all this fuss over...
what is this stuff again?

10:17.770 --> 10:20.305
You heard Franklin Fruitmeier.
It's a secret!

10:20.373 --> 10:21.673
That's why they call it...

10:21.741 --> 10:23.408
Fruitmeier's!

10:28.814 --> 10:32.250
Hey, you know, if that cocoon
does turn out to be organic,

10:32.318 --> 10:35.820
we might have a real honest-to-goodness
monster in Crystal Cove.

10:35.888 --> 10:38.823
My guess? The cocoon is
a multicelled mutation,

10:38.891 --> 10:41.092
probably a result
of radiated allotropes

10:41.160 --> 10:43.595
and free radical implosion.
What do you think, Shaggy?

10:43.662 --> 10:46.498
Uhh, I think I want
more Fruitmeier's!

10:46.565 --> 10:47.932
Yeah, me, too!

10:48.000 --> 10:52.837
Velma, is there something going
on between you and Shaggy?

10:52.905 --> 10:55.673
No. Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

10:55.741 --> 10:58.510
Why would anything ever be going
on between me and Shaggy?

11:01.113 --> 11:04.883
Well, looks like it's
just us, all alone.

11:04.950 --> 11:06.651
Maybe we could go for a drive,

11:06.719 --> 11:08.987
talk about that pretty
locket I found.

11:09.054 --> 11:12.724
Wonder what it would be like to
get such a romantic present.

11:12.792 --> 11:16.594
Oh, come on, Daphne. You know you
don't care about that girly stuff.

11:16.662 --> 11:18.329
That's why
we're such good friends.

11:18.397 --> 11:20.398
I'll drop you at home.
I want to get started

11:20.466 --> 11:21.900
on a new trap for the monster.

11:25.704 --> 11:28.006
Ok.
Good luck with that.

11:47.126 --> 11:48.993
Huh?

11:49.061 --> 11:50.628
Someone there?

12:19.970 --> 12:21.738
Mmm, yeah, Crystal Cove.

12:22.006 --> 12:24.274
That was the rotten
brains with their single

12:24.842 --> 12:26.843
"zombie housewife
blues."

12:26.910 --> 12:30.313
I'm angel dynamite, and
you're listening to k-ghoul,

12:30.381 --> 12:33.316
101.4
on your A.M. dial.

12:34.618 --> 12:36.753
I was wondering when y'all
was going to show up.

12:36.820 --> 12:37.987
He's in the back.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.658
Fred. It's us.

12:42.726 --> 12:44.293
We're here for you.

12:47.131 --> 12:48.664
It's no use, gang.

12:48.732 --> 12:50.166
I was the one
who stole the body,

12:50.234 --> 12:52.502
and Professor Raffalo paid
the price.

12:52.569 --> 12:55.238
I should have listened to my dad and
stayed out of any new mysteries.

12:55.305 --> 12:57.573
We all helped steal
the body, fred.

12:57.641 --> 12:59.575
Well, I actually
never t... ow!

12:59.643 --> 13:02.512
Ok, fine. Yes.
We all took part, Freddy.

13:02.579 --> 13:05.848
Fred Jones, you've never backed
away from a mystery in your life.

13:05.916 --> 13:08.484
I've got nothing!

13:08.552 --> 13:09.819
Man up, fred.

13:09.887 --> 13:11.988
We still have our first
clue, the cocoon.

13:12.056 --> 13:15.291
I brought a sample...
Scooby! What are you doing?

13:15.359 --> 13:18.127
What?
It's Fruitmeier's!

13:18.195 --> 13:20.229
Yummy!

13:20.297 --> 13:21.664
Eww.
Check it out.

13:21.732 --> 13:25.401
If that dog mutates, I'm
putting it down, dig?

13:25.469 --> 13:28.104
Like, hold on.
I think I get it.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.108
Eww.

13:32.176 --> 13:35.044
No, you guys,
it's Fruitmeier's.

13:35.112 --> 13:38.848
The cocoon is made of the same
stuff as Fruitmeier's dessert.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.083
What?

13:44.721 --> 13:46.022
They're right.

13:46.090 --> 13:48.591
But if the cocoon is made
of Fruitmeier's dessert...

13:48.659 --> 13:50.693
That means if we
capture the monster,

13:50.761 --> 13:52.195
we can have our own shop,

13:52.262 --> 13:54.130
and we can have
an endless supply

13:54.198 --> 13:56.732
of Fruitmeier's
dessert. Oh, boy.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.736
Nw. It means that that slime mutant
may not be a monster at all.

14:00.804 --> 14:03.439
What do we know about
Franklin Fruitmeier?

14:03.507 --> 14:07.944
Franklin Fruitmeier showed up in
town out of nowhere 2 months ago.

14:08.011 --> 14:09.946
Before that, nothing.

14:10.013 --> 14:11.781
He's hiring right now
for female servers.

14:11.849 --> 14:13.049
Then that's our in.

14:13.117 --> 14:15.284
If the girls can get
jobs at Fruitmeier's,

14:15.352 --> 14:17.520
they can snoop around
and find out more.

14:17.588 --> 14:19.722
Great idea, shag.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.459
Um. Like, uh,

14:23.527 --> 14:25.561
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

14:25.629 --> 14:28.164
Why are Scooby-Doo and I
dressed like girls,

14:28.232 --> 14:30.399
when velma and Daphne
are girls?

14:30.467 --> 14:33.202
Yeah. My skirt's
too tight.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.104
Because velma and I refused.

14:38.308 --> 14:39.475
Good night, ladies.

14:39.543 --> 14:41.377
â™ª don't forget to lock up! â™ª

14:41.445 --> 14:44.380
Good night, Mr. Fruitmeier.

14:55.526 --> 14:57.126
All right, gang.
Fan out.

14:57.194 --> 14:58.794
See if you can find
anything that will tie

14:58.862 --> 15:01.164
Franklin Fruitmeier
to the slime mutant.

15:10.007 --> 15:12.909
Hmm. Must be a key
around here somewhere.

15:18.081 --> 15:19.282
All clear.

15:19.349 --> 15:21.584
Let's check over there, Scoob.

15:30.327 --> 15:32.428
Run, Scoob!

15:37.334 --> 15:39.669
That's strange.

15:39.736 --> 15:42.505
This closet was locked
a minute ago.

15:42.573 --> 15:45.474
Hey!
What gives?

15:45.542 --> 15:48.811
Freddy, help!
Let me out!

15:48.879 --> 15:50.213
Daphne! Hold on!

15:50.280 --> 15:52.582
We'll get you out!

15:52.649 --> 15:54.717
Gangway!

15:57.821 --> 16:00.089
Are you two insane?

16:01.225 --> 16:03.159
Mo-mo-monster!

16:03.227 --> 16:05.428
Like, right behind us!

16:05.495 --> 16:06.696
Monster?

16:06.763 --> 16:08.030
There's no monster.

16:08.098 --> 16:10.333
Jinkies.
Where's Daphne?

16:11.702 --> 16:14.403
Daphne! Daphne?

16:14.471 --> 16:17.173
Here!
I'm down here!

16:17.241 --> 16:19.041
I'm ok.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.543
But you better get down here.

16:20.611 --> 16:22.345
I think I found something.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.482
This is the same cave we
were in the other day.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.651
It must run right under Fruitmeier's.

16:28.719 --> 16:31.387
And check this out...
someone's been digging.

16:31.455 --> 16:32.955
Hold on a second.

16:33.023 --> 16:34.890
According to my GPS program,

16:34.958 --> 16:37.293
this hole is only 20
yards from Fruitmeier's.

16:37.361 --> 16:38.461
That would put it...

16:38.528 --> 16:41.464
Directly under
Crystal Cove bank.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.699
But dude, like,
why would a slime mutant

16:43.767 --> 16:46.502
bust a hole through Fruitmeier's
to get into a bank?

16:46.570 --> 16:47.937
Maybe it's hungry.

16:48.005 --> 16:49.872
Yeah, hungry for money!

16:49.940 --> 16:52.441
I smell a trap coming on.

16:57.547 --> 16:59.982
Hey, ugly!
Over here!

17:00.050 --> 17:01.984
Huh?

17:08.759 --> 17:10.358
No, stupid, over here!

17:12.429 --> 17:14.063
Wrong again!

17:20.971 --> 17:22.438
Everything set, guys?

17:22.506 --> 17:24.173
Ready!

17:24.241 --> 17:26.709
Now!

17:41.792 --> 17:43.292
Ohh!

18:00.043 --> 18:01.944
This is going to be awesome.

18:25.769 --> 18:27.370
Daphne, run!

18:38.648 --> 18:41.250
Eat, gang.
It's Fruitmeier's.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.931
Ohh!

19:01.471 --> 19:03.973
Now!

19:06.476 --> 19:07.676
Huh?

19:12.048 --> 19:14.650
Fred!
You saved me!

19:14.718 --> 19:15.885
Not right now, Daphne.

19:15.952 --> 19:18.788
I have to figure out why
my trap didn't work.

19:18.855 --> 19:20.723
What is going on here?

19:20.791 --> 19:24.693
Why is the town's latest tourist
attraction cocooned to the wall?

19:24.761 --> 19:26.295
Dad! Sheriff!
Hold on.

19:26.363 --> 19:27.696
You don't understand.

19:27.764 --> 19:29.365
That is not a monster.

19:29.433 --> 19:32.134
Oh, hopping steamed clams, fred.
Then who is it?

19:32.202 --> 19:34.036
Franklin Fruitmeier.

19:34.104 --> 19:36.405
He was trying to rob
Crystal Cove bank.

19:36.473 --> 19:39.408
Uhh, that's impossible.

19:39.476 --> 19:42.144
Franklin Fruitmeier's
the one who called us.

19:42.212 --> 19:43.145
What?

19:43.213 --> 19:44.480
I was making a clipper ship

19:44.548 --> 19:45.815
out of circus balloons

19:45.882 --> 19:47.216
when the silent alarm
rang at my home.

19:47.284 --> 19:48.784
Oh, good gracious!
What is that?

19:48.852 --> 19:51.387
But if the monster isn't
Franklin Fruitmeier,

19:51.455 --> 19:54.056
then, dude, who is it?

19:55.692 --> 19:58.394
Professor Emmanuel Raffalo?

19:58.462 --> 20:02.298
That's right. I was trying to
scare people away from the sewers

20:02.365 --> 20:05.234
while I dug my way into
the bank and got rich.

20:05.302 --> 20:07.136
But you've got a job
as a teacher.

20:07.204 --> 20:08.871
Why do you need more money?

20:10.340 --> 20:11.273
Oh.

20:11.341 --> 20:12.708
Yeah, my bad.
Oh, yeah, right.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.443
You're really
getting ripped off.

20:14.511 --> 20:18.447
I discovered that the Crystal Cove
caves were connected to the sewer

20:18.515 --> 20:22.451
by accident while collecting
mold spores for my class.

20:22.519 --> 20:26.222
Once I realized the cave
led right under the bank,

20:26.289 --> 20:28.457
I put my plan into motion.

20:28.525 --> 20:31.527
Fruitmeier's gave me
secret access to the sewer,

20:31.595 --> 20:35.865
so I decided to frame
balloon boy for the crime

20:35.932 --> 20:38.534
by using
his disgusting dessert.

20:38.602 --> 20:40.603
I staged my own disappearance

20:40.670 --> 20:43.906
to throw doubt on any
hint of my involvement.

20:45.342 --> 20:48.944
Oh, it was foolproof, genius.

20:49.012 --> 20:51.113
That is,
until you... you...

20:51.181 --> 20:52.448
meddling.

20:52.516 --> 20:56.285
Meddling... yes, meddling
kids and your blasted dog

20:56.353 --> 20:58.454
ruined everything.

20:58.522 --> 21:02.191
Wait. What about this locket we
found where you were digging?

21:05.629 --> 21:07.897
Never seen it before.

21:09.266 --> 21:11.700
All right.
Well, guess we owe you kids thanks.

21:11.768 --> 21:13.536
You did save the bank.

21:13.603 --> 21:17.306
Although you also lost the
town a serious revenue stream.

21:17.374 --> 21:19.642
Stream of revenue!

21:24.581 --> 21:25.748
You ok, Daph?

21:25.815 --> 21:27.116
I just don't get it.

21:27.183 --> 21:29.518
If this locket didn't belong
to Professor Raffalo,

21:29.586 --> 21:31.020
then who?

21:31.087 --> 21:34.356
Like, k-ghoul 101.4.

21:34.424 --> 21:36.792
What can we scare up for you, daddy-o?

21:36.860 --> 21:39.528
You're all doomed.

21:39.596 --> 21:41.196
Like, uh...

21:41.264 --> 21:43.332
Like, who...
who is this?

21:43.400 --> 21:46.268
You can call me
Mr. e.

21:46.336 --> 21:49.939
You should never have brought
that locket out of the cave.

21:50.006 --> 21:52.441
You don't know
what you've uncovered.

21:52.509 --> 21:54.877
Uncovered?
Uncovered what?

21:54.945 --> 21:58.380
A truth that should have
remained hidden...

21:58.448 --> 22:01.717
the truth behind the
curse of Crystal Cove.

22:01.785 --> 22:05.554
The real mystery
has just begun.

22:05.622 --> 22:06.889
Scooby...

22:06.957 --> 22:08.223
Dooby...

22:08.291 --> 22:09.625
Doo.
