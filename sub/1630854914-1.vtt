00:23.798 --> 00:26.548
(dramatic music)

00:35.872 --> 00:38.705
(keyboard typing)

00:49.109 --> 00:52.776
(electronic music fades in)

01:06.045 --> 01:09.545
(upbeat electronic party music)

02:37.611 --> 02:40.528
(orchestral music)

03:05.968 --> 03:07.668
(water splashing)

03:07.668 --> 03:10.676
- Hi. Sorry. I like to get
an early morning swim in.

03:10.676 --> 03:13.650
(water splashing)

03:13.650 --> 03:16.350
- You have a really nice place.

03:16.350 --> 03:17.453
- Oh, thank you.

03:17.453 --> 03:21.993
I mean, it's rented and now I
have roommates, but thank you.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.910
Would you like some breakfast, maybe?

03:27.420 --> 03:28.470
- Who am I to say no?

03:32.340 --> 03:35.130
- You like some fresh fruit
from the exotic Orient?

03:35.130 --> 03:36.180
- Who am I to say no?

03:38.100 --> 03:41.340
- I will have you know.

03:41.340 --> 03:45.423
I took a tramp steamer six
months across the Atlantic.

03:46.786 --> 03:49.620
Herds of elephants to the fields of Siam,

03:49.620 --> 03:51.670
just to get as fresh as possible for you.

03:53.490 --> 03:55.148
- Wow.

03:55.148 --> 03:56.670
- That's a lie.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.890
I went to the green grocer.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.303
- Wow. The green grocer.

04:06.660 --> 04:09.342
- Oh yeah, you might have noticed that.

04:09.342 --> 04:10.890
- Yeah.

04:10.890 --> 04:12.450
- It's a computer.

04:12.450 --> 04:13.623
- Oh, yeah, I'm aware.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.160
- You know, I, I need it for work,

04:17.160 --> 04:19.770
but I hate that thing, honestly.

04:19.770 --> 04:23.100
But that's how you work in a bikini.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.070
- Yeah, you look really good in a bikini.

04:26.070 --> 04:27.063
- Thank you.

04:28.232 --> 04:29.947
You know, on the net, no
one knows that your 20,

04:29.947 --> 04:34.947
your a 21 year old girl in a
bikini that like, you know,

04:34.980 --> 04:38.130
likes to spend a day outside
by the pool most of the day.

04:38.130 --> 04:41.010
- Well, you look good in a bikini.

04:41.010 --> 04:41.843
- Thank you.

04:41.843 --> 04:44.640
- I'm sure that you're very professional,

04:44.640 --> 04:47.040
and that some organization
values you very much.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.063
- Could you get that for me?

04:54.210 --> 04:55.043
- Get what?

04:55.043 --> 04:55.876
- It's like a, a pad or it,

04:55.876 --> 04:57.873
with like something written on it.

05:00.660 --> 05:01.493
Eric Johnson.

05:01.493 --> 05:05.696
He's the Vice President of
Second National Bank of England.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.230
(blonde girl sighs)

05:07.230 --> 05:08.070
It's like, you know,

05:08.070 --> 05:09.630
one of the biggest banks in the world,

05:09.630 --> 05:10.770
it's bigger than the first.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.753
- Um, Okay.

05:14.010 --> 05:17.947
- And, huh! And we're in!

05:17.947 --> 05:20.040
- Now I can access all
of his controls of banks,

05:20.040 --> 05:20.873
and the money.

05:20.873 --> 05:23.520
Create loans, redistribute
money, and, you know,

05:23.520 --> 05:25.320
pretty much everything is already set up,

05:25.320 --> 05:28.438
so it can be done with
a couple of keystrokes.

05:28.438 --> 05:32.160
- Okay. What is going on?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.870
- Do you like your fruit?

05:33.870 --> 05:36.540
Kiwi is sometimes call Chinese gooseberry.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.990
It's fascinating how much
stuff comes from China.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.870
- What are you doing?

05:42.870 --> 05:44.790
- Um, I'm, I'm just, you know,

05:44.790 --> 05:47.283
hacking the mainframe,
as the expression goes.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.970
You know, controlling network
so they give me what we want

05:50.970 --> 05:53.130
and then I, I could be a billionaire,

05:53.130 --> 05:55.503
but I, I've got interest, you know.

05:57.387 --> 06:00.180
I could be a billionaire,
but I have an interest.

06:00.180 --> 06:02.940
- Wait, you're a what? How
are you doing all of this?

06:02.940 --> 06:04.923
- I, I typed in that number.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.870
You know what you hear, like,
elaborate stories of like,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.090
people typing in a hundred
lines a minute, you know,

06:12.090 --> 06:15.240
using elaborate malware.
But it's really just that.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.835
I, I typed in a number.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.817
- But how did you get this number?

06:20.785 --> 06:23.976
- And that's where the game comes in.

06:23.976 --> 06:27.309
(soft electronic music)

08:20.477 --> 08:21.310
- [Brunette Woman] Dear Pentamis,

08:21.310 --> 08:23.580
I never thought this would happen to me.

08:23.580 --> 08:27.360
To be quite honest, I never
thought of this at all, really.

08:27.360 --> 08:31.380
It's easy to imagine yourself
a doctor, or an astronaut,

08:31.380 --> 08:33.030
or even a vampire,

08:33.030 --> 08:36.540
but I never expected I would
end up a bikini hacker.

08:36.540 --> 08:38.520
What does that even mean?

08:38.520 --> 08:41.190
I can't remember the last
time I even wore a bikini.

08:41.190 --> 08:42.900
It's not really me.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.270
I did dream about working in film,

08:45.270 --> 08:47.760
living in Los Angeles, Hollywood,

08:47.760 --> 08:51.000
but I didn't dream about
being an actor or a director,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.420
or even a writer. I dreamt
about being a film editor.

08:54.420 --> 08:58.380
And five months ago I did
follow my dream and moved to LA.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.820
I worked mostly editing

08:59.820 --> 09:03.738
or assisting the editor of
reality TV, cheap commercials.

09:03.738 --> 09:05.340
Nothing too exciting.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.490
And I found myself in a very unreal place.

09:08.490 --> 09:10.440
It was starting to get to me, really.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.830
And I didn't know how long
my LA experiment would last.

09:13.830 --> 09:16.920
However, it was a place
where dreams met reality.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.530
And for me, that was when I met...

09:19.530 --> 09:20.853
- My name is Lana Joke.

09:21.870 --> 09:23.100
- Joke?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.750
- It's Danish.

09:24.750 --> 09:25.877
I'm the active head

09:25.877 --> 09:29.070
of the Hacker Collective
Group, XDelta Revenge.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.867
Wait, does my makeup look okay?

09:30.867 --> 09:32.163
- Oh. Yeah. It's fine.

09:33.121 --> 09:36.827
- I'm, I'm off by the
pool, you know, and I,

09:36.827 --> 09:40.352
I like to tan and, and
water and, who am I kidding?

09:40.352 --> 09:42.837
I like to look good. What was I?

09:42.837 --> 09:46.110
- Uh, the International Hacker Collective?

09:46.110 --> 09:46.943
- Right.

09:46.943 --> 09:48.660
Um, bent on putting the world

09:48.660 --> 09:51.240
to a more just and equitable way and,

09:51.240 --> 09:54.093
and take out, take down the,
the corporate nations thing.

09:58.045 --> 09:59.550
Are my nails okay?

09:59.550 --> 10:01.440
- [Tiffany] They look fine.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.880
- Well.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.043
- She always worries about the silly shit.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.250
- I would like to
introduce you to Tiffany.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.563
Well, my entire organization actually.

10:12.030 --> 10:14.160
Some collective groups
have like, you know,

10:14.160 --> 10:15.540
meeting boards and, and Reddit.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.510
But we have a nice house. Does wonders.

10:18.510 --> 10:21.210
- You can track that shit in an instant.

10:21.210 --> 10:24.360
- Well, Tiffany's in charge of
physical security, you know,

10:24.360 --> 10:28.320
like electric sensors and locks and stuff.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.836
- Yep.

10:29.836 --> 10:31.080
- Wait, what do you mean?

10:31.080 --> 10:33.570
Like the electronic lock systems? Or?

10:33.570 --> 10:35.970
- I have a crowbar. Works
better than you think.

10:38.910 --> 10:41.100
- She spent three years in 'Nam.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.183
- Wait, what?

10:42.183 --> 10:44.790
- Vietnam. It's a nice country.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.350
- It was a college thing.

10:46.350 --> 10:49.950
I used to help assistant
manage a hotel there. But yeah.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.900
Anyways, I helped break the doors down.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.993
- Anyway, here's Pauline.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.570
Pauline can get anywhere.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.310
- She's overstating.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.210
- Not the greatest talker,

11:00.210 --> 11:03.630
but you need someone in a
room halfway around the world,

11:03.630 --> 11:04.730
Pauline can get there.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.433
- Wait,

11:10.433 --> 11:12.600
are you opening your laptop so
you can show me a webcam feed

11:12.600 --> 11:15.330
of Pauline halfway around
the world in some room?

11:15.330 --> 11:16.680
- She's not magic.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.650
- No, no, no, no.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.423
- Oh, last thing, we have Erin.

11:23.130 --> 11:26.010
- Okay, so you do the actual computers.

11:26.010 --> 11:27.510
- I mean, we're, we're all hackers,

11:27.510 --> 11:30.300
but I do really like computers.
That's why I got into it.

11:30.300 --> 11:34.650
- Well, Erin's skillset is, she
can seduce anyone, anywhere!

11:34.650 --> 11:36.540
She can get into their pants.

11:36.540 --> 11:37.980
- I hate it when you call it that.

11:37.980 --> 11:42.033
- I'm sorry. She's the, the
indistinct? woman. The charmer.

11:43.140 --> 11:45.213
- I mean, it is a skillset. Yeah.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.273
- Oh, sorry. I said lastly.
I didn't mean lastly.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.221
Cause lastly we have Willy Tallsalt.

11:55.079 --> 11:57.270
- Willy Tallsalt, at your service.

11:57.270 --> 11:58.950
I help girls in need,

11:58.950 --> 12:02.250
restore balance to the great green earth.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.843
- He handles logistics.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.240
- One might not think it,

12:06.240 --> 12:09.630
but there is a lot of complex
systems required to make

12:09.630 --> 12:12.570
an elaborate international operation work.

12:12.570 --> 12:15.060
Even if it's just four people.

12:15.060 --> 12:19.290
Transportation, supplies,
dealing with local authorities.

12:19.290 --> 12:20.673
It's a huge task.

12:21.810 --> 12:25.020
- I would imagine so.

12:25.020 --> 12:27.450
- Anyway, we're a crazy bunch.

12:27.450 --> 12:29.070
- It wouldn't be a problem
if you had followed

12:29.070 --> 12:33.200
the dish schedule that I'd
laminated at my own expense.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.100
- I, I mean, I don't mean
to speak up or anything,

12:35.100 --> 12:36.930
but why would you get it laminated?

12:36.930 --> 12:38.550
I get the idea of making
it hard and everything,

12:38.550 --> 12:39.750
but that just means...

12:39.750 --> 12:41.517
- Well, it's laminated
in case you can't do it.

12:41.517 --> 12:44.100
You can black it out and
switch with someone else.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.260
That way you can easily see it.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.993
- I live on the rainbow that
comes from unicorn horns.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.423
- Okay.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.968
- Ah, anyway. Where was I?

12:54.968 --> 12:59.223
We are a crazy bunch, but
would you like to join us?

13:05.837 --> 13:07.500
- Join you for what?

13:07.500 --> 13:08.340
What are we gonna do?

13:08.340 --> 13:11.220
Like a bikini car wash
to save the rec center?

13:11.220 --> 13:13.710
- Actually yeah, we are.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.240
That's on Sunday, right?

13:15.240 --> 13:16.073
- Sunday.

13:17.008 --> 13:19.263
- That's not important though.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.303
- That, that means she could
help us with that though.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.560
- That?

13:25.560 --> 13:27.180
- We have figured out a way to

13:27.180 --> 13:30.783
take all the money in the world
and redistribute the wealth.

13:31.740 --> 13:32.880
- I mean, I'll be honest,

13:32.880 --> 13:35.640
these car washes can be a hit or miss.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.250
Sometimes you get plenty,
sometimes who cares?

13:38.250 --> 13:39.570
Nobody comes.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.820
But it's especially fun
if it's a hot afternoon.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.980
- The world runs on candy
cans and sugar cubes

13:43.980 --> 13:45.813
fermented in Dayton, Ohio.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.960
- Anyway, the opposite corporation

13:51.960 --> 13:53.370
is one of the largest in the world.

13:53.370 --> 13:55.530
Though, I'm, I'm not sure
if you've heard of it,

13:55.530 --> 13:57.600
but it's funny cause all they provide is

13:57.600 --> 14:00.777
network infrastructure and security and,

14:00.777 --> 14:03.330
and they're like the best
of the banks, you know,

14:03.330 --> 14:05.370
they take, they have all
the money in the world.

14:05.370 --> 14:09.030
And, and if you take that
out, everything crumbles.

14:09.030 --> 14:12.720
So it's going to be dangerous
and, and a little tricky.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.530
But are you...

14:23.523 --> 14:26.190
(door clicking)

14:27.997 --> 14:30.330
- Hey, I'm sorry about this.

14:31.950 --> 14:36.950
- Yeah. It's just that, I'm a...

14:37.860 --> 14:39.030
Okay, I don't wanna say nobody,

14:39.030 --> 14:40.710
but I just came out here to do film,

14:40.710 --> 14:44.730
you know, edit, log footage,
maybe do reality television,

14:44.730 --> 14:48.510
and this whole thing is
just so, it's really...

14:48.510 --> 14:50.400
- Maybe little much?

14:50.400 --> 14:51.300
- Yeah.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.203
- I understand.

14:53.874 --> 14:57.690
- Well, this has been a weird morning.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.010
- Totally.

14:59.010 --> 15:00.210
- You drove here, right?

15:05.310 --> 15:06.363
- So what's the plan?

15:10.800 --> 15:11.883
- So what's the play?

15:13.050 --> 15:15.181
- When was the last
time you wore a bikini?

15:15.181 --> 15:16.014
(upbeat music starts)

15:16.014 --> 15:17.940
- [Lana] The OBSEC
corporation's main industry

15:17.940 --> 15:21.321
is network infrastructure and security.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.421
The best in the world.

15:23.671 --> 15:26.490
(Brunette sighs disgustedly)

15:26.490 --> 15:29.583
Such they can't really be backdoor hacked.

15:33.180 --> 15:36.873
With any of the flash and eyes, and eyes.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.820
I, I know there are other words,

15:41.820 --> 15:45.273
but pretty much any of the
traditional hacking methods.

15:46.863 --> 15:47.696
- Uh uh.

15:49.620 --> 15:52.440
- [Lana] Right. We're
not going to break in.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.961
And what's worse, the second we did,

15:54.961 --> 15:57.270
people are monitoring every second.

15:57.270 --> 16:00.843
So if something happens,
they will notice it.

16:02.343 --> 16:06.270
Unless the company CEO did it?

16:06.270 --> 16:09.150
From it's personal computer?

16:09.150 --> 16:13.069
And told the people that it was okay.

16:13.069 --> 16:14.943
- Not on your life.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.630
- It's located in the corporate
headquarters in Houston.

16:18.630 --> 16:19.770
- Houston?

16:19.770 --> 16:20.820
- Trust me.

16:20.820 --> 16:23.550
That a large international
company is located in Houston,

16:23.550 --> 16:25.650
is probably going to be
the most logical thing

16:25.650 --> 16:27.690
we're going to encounter.

16:27.690 --> 16:30.240
67 levels, 50 guards,

16:30.240 --> 16:33.303
and virtually every
electronic measure possible.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.290
Getting into the parking
lot is gonna be hard,

16:37.290 --> 16:39.647
but his main computer is on the 25th floor

16:39.647 --> 16:41.100
of his personal office.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.492
So we just gotta get in,

16:43.492 --> 16:46.620
get his password, and
confuse the people in charge

16:46.620 --> 16:49.923
and install the program and get
out without getting noticed.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.600
And since they think they
have some kind of, you know,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.510
way of monitoring his movements,

16:57.510 --> 17:00.123
he has to be in the
building at the same time.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.840
- Okay, sure. That sounds easy.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.490
- I'm climbing through the air vent a la

17:05.490 --> 17:07.953
the 1998 Kurt Russell movie, Soldier.

17:09.660 --> 17:13.773
- I get your skepticism,
but we have one advantage.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.633
He's a man.

17:21.961 --> 17:23.383
- Sam?

17:23.383 --> 17:24.216
- Yes.

17:24.216 --> 17:25.049
- It's Sam, isn't it?

17:25.049 --> 17:25.882
- Yes, it is.

17:25.882 --> 17:28.800
- You've been with us for eight years.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.570
- Yes. Yes I have.

17:30.570 --> 17:31.620
- I just heard through the grapevine

17:31.620 --> 17:32.940
that you just got a baby.

17:32.940 --> 17:34.410
- Oh yes. He's adorable.

17:34.410 --> 17:35.340
Do you wanna see some pics?

17:35.340 --> 17:36.173
- Do I?

17:39.571 --> 17:42.900
Oh, adorable. What's his name?

17:42.900 --> 17:43.733
- Jose.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.210
- Sounds fancy.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.280
- Yeah, my wife is Brazilian.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.410
- Oh yeah. Neat.

17:49.410 --> 17:50.823
I was in Brazil.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.093
Gee, I have a great story about Brazil.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.173
Left the brain.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.798
Anyway, you're fired.

18:01.798 --> 18:02.895
- [Richard Dawson] God. Oh god.

18:02.895 --> 18:04.733
I love it when they cry.
I love it when they cry.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.920
- [Lana] This man is Richard
Dawson, the company CEO.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.520
He's legally entitled to
be called the founder,

18:14.520 --> 18:16.890
but he actually isn't.

18:16.890 --> 18:19.050
He's radical indistinct evil.

18:33.258 --> 18:36.175
(mysterious music)

18:52.552 --> 18:56.219
(crackling electric noises)

19:10.026 --> 19:13.943
(electronic music intensifies)

19:20.100 --> 19:21.480
- Danielson.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.500
- Yeah?

19:22.500 --> 19:23.790
- How's our infrastructure?

19:23.790 --> 19:26.430
- Well, we had a brief
denial of service attack.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.956
I think it came from India.

19:27.956 --> 19:29.760
Could be a bit of new malware.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.663
- How's it doing?

19:31.890 --> 19:33.240
- Great, sir.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.977
- That's what I need to
hear. If I don't, well,

19:35.977 --> 19:38.460
I'm kind of wired from
having just fired someone

19:38.460 --> 19:39.690
and I don't think in my condition

19:39.690 --> 19:41.970
I could fire someone else so quickly.

19:41.970 --> 19:43.350
- It's okay.

19:43.350 --> 19:46.500
- We have a new client,
Atlanta Corporation.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.857
They're, they're something.

19:52.830 --> 19:54.060
Anyway, the CEO wants to make sure

19:54.060 --> 19:55.770
we can handle the extra traffic.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.630
- Legal is taking care of the
paperwork for next week, sir.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.180
- Ooh, great work Stasia, keep it legal.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.190
That's your responsibility.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.150
- It's gonna be no problem.

20:03.150 --> 20:04.650
We just need to get some new servers

20:04.650 --> 20:06.594
to serve the system a little faster.

20:06.594 --> 20:08.190
- In English?

20:08.190 --> 20:09.360
- We'll be okay.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.970
- Great. We're throwing a
ceremony to sign the contract.

20:11.970 --> 20:14.610
Show 'em around. It's funny,

20:14.610 --> 20:17.430
have you heard of the furry people

20:17.430 --> 20:19.560
that wear those silly bear costumes?

20:19.560 --> 20:20.940
- Yeah.

20:20.940 --> 20:21.773
- So is he.

20:24.840 --> 20:25.940
- Don't screw this up.

20:33.210 --> 20:34.710
- My beloved.

20:34.710 --> 20:36.810
- The Atlanta Corporation
is actually a good pawn.

20:36.810 --> 20:39.000
There's going to be a lot
of people in the building

20:39.000 --> 20:41.060
and why it's not like the Met Gala.

20:41.060 --> 20:44.400
- If only one day, one day.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.590
- There is going to be
a lot of outside people,

20:46.590 --> 20:48.663
in a somewhat not alert state.

20:49.860 --> 20:52.800
- Um, why are we wearing bikinis?

20:52.800 --> 20:56.189
- Well, I thought we're gonna
get some fun in at the pool.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.721
(water splashing)

20:58.721 --> 21:01.521
(girls giggling)

21:01.521 --> 21:05.021
(upbeat electronic music)

21:13.876 --> 21:18.513
(girls giggling and splashing)

21:18.513 --> 21:19.560
- Wow, your tits are amazing.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.533
- Stop. Yours are amazing.

21:33.330 --> 21:35.190
- What's eating her?

21:35.190 --> 21:36.961
- Monsters from the end of time,

21:36.961 --> 21:39.750
slowly they consume her soul,

21:39.750 --> 21:41.643
with small serrated teeth.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.970
- I think you're just more
of a free spirit than I am.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.520
- I consider it a good quality.

21:55.388 --> 21:56.673
Oh, thank you Willie.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.772
- So you really think
that this is gonna work?

22:00.772 --> 22:05.605
- Let's not worry about it
right now. Let's have some fun.

22:15.071 --> 22:18.571
(mysterious techno music)

22:52.360 --> 22:53.523
- Yeah, yeah.

22:55.380 --> 22:59.100
We were gonna use the
services anyway, but...

22:59.100 --> 23:00.810
- [Pauline] Sir, I wanted to introduce you

23:00.810 --> 23:02.520
to your new assistant.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.993
- Hi, I'm Erin.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.890
- Did I need a new assistant?

23:07.890 --> 23:09.360
- [Erin] Yes.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.350
- Oh, sorry.

23:10.350 --> 23:13.770
Sometimes I get lost, you know, thinking.

23:13.770 --> 23:16.110
- Well, why don't I help remind you?

23:16.110 --> 23:18.010
- Who's that girl you just brought in?

23:19.536 --> 23:21.660
(door clicking)

23:21.660 --> 23:24.303
- Part one is in place.
Now we need part two.

23:26.064 --> 23:28.200
(mysterious chiming music)

23:28.200 --> 23:29.321
- [Tiffany] Hey.

23:29.321 --> 23:30.154
(metal clinking)

23:30.154 --> 23:32.654
(man moaning)

23:36.990 --> 23:37.823
- Step two.

23:42.328 --> 23:43.723
- Who did this to you?

23:45.014 --> 23:47.014
- I don't know. Bikinis.

23:55.290 --> 23:57.333
- Get on it. Tell the boys upstairs.

23:59.866 --> 24:01.856
(heavy breathing)

24:01.856 --> 24:06.510
- Oh God. Wow. Oh.

24:06.510 --> 24:09.103
- [Erin] Hey, I was thinking,

24:09.103 --> 24:11.100
I heard that you were going
to an event later tonight.

24:11.100 --> 24:12.697
Maybe I could be your plus one.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.710
- I don't know. You know,

24:16.710 --> 24:20.443
it's kind of a big deal and
I don't even want to go.

24:20.443 --> 24:22.743
Maybe it's not such a good idea.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.020
- You sure?

24:25.020 --> 24:28.136
I mean, I'll let you
touch my boobs some more.

24:28.136 --> 24:30.810
- I think things are progressing smoothly.

24:30.810 --> 24:33.510
- I don't entirely understand this.

24:33.510 --> 24:34.770
- What part?

24:34.770 --> 24:38.550
- Everything, but especially
this part with the computers.

24:38.550 --> 24:42.120
- Well, what we're going to do
is to complicated for humans.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.060
So we're going to have to use a program.

24:45.060 --> 24:46.530
I hate these things.

24:46.530 --> 24:49.920
Anyway, use this flash drive

24:49.920 --> 24:52.048
and plug it into the computer,

24:52.048 --> 24:55.620
and, and run the program and, and yeah,

24:55.620 --> 24:57.570
just run the update.com.

24:57.570 --> 25:00.990
- Yeah, I, I mean, I guess
I work with computers.

25:00.990 --> 25:01.823
- Anyway.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.653
This is what happens.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.973
And, and this is what it looks like.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.693
I just hate that.

25:13.797 --> 25:15.273
I hate flashy things.

25:16.277 --> 25:18.630
Oh, I'm going to hack the matrix.

25:18.630 --> 25:21.110
I'm going to bust the system.

25:21.110 --> 25:23.525
In just three nano clicks. Haha!

25:23.525 --> 25:25.473
- I mean, it's okay.

25:27.930 --> 25:30.813
- Sometimes I wish I stayed
in bikini computer repair.

25:34.606 --> 25:36.090
- I just want everything
tonight to go smoothly.

25:36.090 --> 25:38.460
This is a big deal. In
a lifetime, billions.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.830
I just, I just feel over the edge.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.863
I just, yeah. I need to calm down.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.040
How long have you worked for the company?

25:47.040 --> 25:48.570
Yeah?

25:48.570 --> 25:50.424
Has your pension been funded?

25:50.424 --> 25:52.933
(keyboard clicking)

25:52.933 --> 25:55.933
(suspenseful music)

26:13.029 --> 26:18.029
(music ends abruptly and
keyboard clicks continue)

26:28.804 --> 26:30.540
(suspenseful music)

26:30.540 --> 26:31.890
- [Erin] Why the long face?

26:33.810 --> 26:34.863
- Just old memories.

26:37.140 --> 26:37.973
- It'll be okay.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.695
Hey, hey driver. Stop the car, quick.

26:44.695 --> 26:48.695
(suspenseful music intensifies)

26:50.430 --> 26:51.263
- [Erin] Hey.

26:53.267 --> 26:55.170
- Our car broke down.

26:55.170 --> 26:56.630
- That's a shame.

26:56.630 --> 26:58.320
- Do you guys need a ride?

26:58.320 --> 26:59.153
- Yeah.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.770
- Jump in.

27:01.770 --> 27:02.603
- [Brunette Woman] Awesome.

27:02.603 --> 27:03.443
We're going to a corporate event.

27:03.443 --> 27:04.276
- Come on!

27:07.953 --> 27:10.453
(doors close)

27:14.927 --> 27:16.455
(seatbelt clicks)

27:16.455 --> 27:19.955
(upbeat electronic music)

27:21.017 --> 27:24.017
(keyboard clicking)

28:03.355 --> 28:06.385
- Ah, it's important to
roll out the red carpet.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.357
- Yes sir.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.857
(heavy breathing and moaning)

28:12.857 --> 28:15.274
- Ah, oh yeah. Oh. Oh. Ooooh.

28:16.657 --> 28:18.740
(grunts)

28:20.807 --> 28:24.640
(high pitched snoring noises)

28:48.420 --> 28:49.670
- The car has checked in.

28:55.080 --> 28:55.913
- What?

29:00.999 --> 29:01.832
- [Male Voice Over Phone]
Did you notice that?

29:01.832 --> 29:03.439
- Yeah, what was it?

29:03.439 --> 29:04.650
- [Male Voice Over Phone] It
only happened in the building.

29:04.650 --> 29:06.360
No damage to the network system.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.310
The batteries kept that from affecting it.

29:08.310 --> 29:09.777
- In English.

29:09.777 --> 29:10.800
- [Male Voice Over Phone]
I think we're okay.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.350
- All right, let's get on this.

29:13.320 --> 29:16.320
Can you handle this? I
need to get to the action.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.153
- Yes sir.

29:17.153 --> 29:19.593
- Make me seem proactive.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.020
- [Lana] Hi. My name is Walker.

29:25.020 --> 29:26.973
I'm the CEO of Atlanta Corporation.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.370
- Hello.

29:29.370 --> 29:31.650
- Um, I was going to see Richard Dawson

29:31.650 --> 29:33.090
to sign some contracts about

29:33.090 --> 29:35.463
my company's network infrastructure.

29:37.684 --> 29:42.453
Yeah, we had some rigamarole
regarding the car at the front.

29:43.650 --> 29:45.200
- [Pauline] Is there a problem?

29:47.400 --> 29:50.313
- Mr. Walker is a man.

29:51.270 --> 29:53.970
- Okay, inside is the burst.

29:53.970 --> 29:56.823
Hopefully this uniform gives
me some cover for a bit.

29:58.427 --> 30:01.427
(keyboard clicking)

30:02.508 --> 30:05.425
(mysterious music)

30:26.439 --> 30:31.439
- [Walker] Wooooow. That was just, wow.

30:34.172 --> 30:35.005
(door closes)

30:35.005 --> 30:35.838
Hey, where did the...

30:35.838 --> 30:37.291
Oh, ho ho, oooh.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.293
(moaning)

30:39.293 --> 30:41.126
Muah muah muah muah muah
muah muah muah muah muah.

30:41.126 --> 30:41.959
- Thanks.

30:44.490 --> 30:47.250
- You see Jenna, expression
is a very complicated thing.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.380
One you can't fully make assumptions on.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.900
I'm not mad at you for calling me a man,

30:51.900 --> 30:54.213
but it doesn't fully express.

30:55.436 --> 30:59.413
- I do apologize. I really
do for making assumptions.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.193
- It's okay.

31:02.640 --> 31:03.720
- You may or may not have noticed,

31:03.720 --> 31:05.160
we had a security incident.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.800
Mr. Dawson is taking
care of that right now.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.360
- Shows that he's on the ball.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.243
That's what we signed up to guard, right?

31:13.792 --> 31:16.200
Whatever we do.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.160
- Isolate the mainframe.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.080
Make sure no texts have
gone to this system.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.520
- In English?

31:20.520 --> 31:22.560
- We're just making
sure nothing's going on.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.360
Or we're speaking with the
power company and they haven't

31:24.360 --> 31:26.270
realized anything unusual.

31:26.270 --> 31:29.190
- (yelling) Then what was it?

31:29.190 --> 31:33.150
- We don't know. But so
far it's not that bad.

31:33.150 --> 31:34.293
- English.

31:35.760 --> 31:39.181
- Um, how's that not English.

31:39.181 --> 31:41.183
(keyboard clicking)

31:41.183 --> 31:44.183
(suspenseful music)

32:04.400 --> 32:07.067
(door creaking)

32:11.661 --> 32:14.661
(clinking on floor)

32:22.586 --> 32:25.086
(funky music)

32:32.819 --> 32:35.569
(feet shuffling)

32:38.040 --> 32:39.630
- We were going to sign the paperwork,

32:39.630 --> 32:42.303
but we should wait for him.

32:43.770 --> 32:45.330
Want a tour?

32:45.330 --> 32:46.480
- Interested in a tour?

32:50.557 --> 32:51.480
- What?

32:51.480 --> 32:54.693
- It's a joke. This is
a place of business.

32:58.860 --> 33:00.568
- Oh, excuse me, miss?

33:00.568 --> 33:01.978
Do you have an appointment?

33:01.978 --> 33:05.517
- Yes. I'm here to see Cheryl.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.023
- Oh, okay.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.260
I don't know why I bothered.

33:13.258 --> 33:16.175
(mysterious music)

33:20.190 --> 33:21.663
- There's always a Cheryl.

33:24.330 --> 33:25.890
- Hey.

33:25.890 --> 33:27.063
- Yeah, I'm new.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.320
- Yeah, well, it's okay.

33:31.320 --> 33:34.890
Boss likes firing people for less reasons.

33:34.890 --> 33:36.810
- Not me. I'm gonna stay forever.

33:36.810 --> 33:37.771
- Hmm.

33:37.771 --> 33:41.100
I like your attitude
and your non-traditional

33:41.100 --> 33:43.140
way of wearing a uniform.

33:43.140 --> 33:43.973
Hmm.

33:43.973 --> 33:45.388
- I got it in 'Nam.

33:45.388 --> 33:46.320
- What?

33:46.320 --> 33:47.250
- Vietnam.

33:47.250 --> 33:50.580
It's very hot. I should uh,
probably buttoned this up now.

33:50.580 --> 33:52.773
- Oh, not for my sake.

33:53.910 --> 33:55.420
- No what? I should probably...

34:01.770 --> 34:03.993
- Hey, where's my shirt?

34:06.900 --> 34:07.733
Thanks.

34:19.830 --> 34:21.510
- [Richard Dawson] Hey.
Just wanted to tell you,

34:21.510 --> 34:24.363
you're fired! Get out!

34:29.970 --> 34:31.290
You know what?

34:31.290 --> 34:32.910
Lost my temper.

34:32.910 --> 34:34.953
Lost my temper.

34:35.910 --> 34:36.873
Can you stay?

34:37.710 --> 34:39.363
Can you please stay?

34:40.440 --> 34:42.993
I mean, don't do it for me.

34:43.950 --> 34:45.333
Don't even do it for you.

34:46.590 --> 34:50.340
Do it for the Benz man.

34:50.340 --> 34:54.210
Do it for the Benz, please.

34:54.210 --> 34:56.343
It would mean the world.

35:07.170 --> 35:11.583
Just kidding. You're fired!

35:16.830 --> 35:18.090
Hey, was just talking,

35:18.090 --> 35:20.820
turns out you are the only
one who has some sort of

35:20.820 --> 35:23.790
software license stuff. We need you back.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.590
Kay? Hey Ronnie.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.093
Doing great bud.

35:32.401 --> 35:34.892
(intense electronic music)

35:34.892 --> 35:37.892
(keyboard clicking)

36:02.730 --> 36:04.330
- Sorry, this is taking so long.

36:05.940 --> 36:07.590
- Could you describe
to me more the services

36:07.590 --> 36:08.690
your company provides?

36:10.650 --> 36:11.483
- Well.

36:12.630 --> 36:13.503
- In English?

36:15.720 --> 36:17.468
- I am familiar with that phrase.

36:17.468 --> 36:20.051
(women giggle)

36:21.255 --> 36:22.855
- [Pauline] Puberty love, is so.

36:23.820 --> 36:25.260
- Sorry, getting some cross chatter.

36:25.260 --> 36:27.109
It's hard to pay attention.

36:27.109 --> 36:28.113
- Yeah.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.330
- Well that's it forever.
Hey, how are you?

36:33.330 --> 36:35.040
We talked a lot. It's
good to meet in person.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.840
- Yes. Yes.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.010
This is my date.

36:38.010 --> 36:38.843
- Hey.

36:40.770 --> 36:43.860
- I know it's not part of the plan,

36:43.860 --> 36:45.360
but don't mess this up for me.

36:47.310 --> 36:48.720
- Hey. Okay.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.550
Listen. Before we sign anything,

36:50.550 --> 36:52.770
I wanna show you our security center.

36:52.770 --> 36:54.000
Dealing with a little bit of issues,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.010
but it's a good illustration
of the hard men and women

36:56.010 --> 36:57.060
we have working here.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.163
- Those birds are so angry.

37:16.110 --> 37:18.362
- Crab experiments?

37:18.362 --> 37:19.361
- [Male Voice] Skatter skatter skatter!

37:19.361 --> 37:20.194
Skatter skatter skatter!

37:20.194 --> 37:21.853
Skatter skatter skatter!

37:21.853 --> 37:24.600
- I was three months away
from finding my pension.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.040
- That's too bad, Cheryl.

37:26.040 --> 37:26.883
Cheryl.

37:27.990 --> 37:32.990
- Sit up and fly straight. And
remember, birds do not exist.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.590
- Working hard?

37:37.590 --> 37:38.943
- Hardly working.

37:39.850 --> 37:40.683
- Good.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.128
(computer noises)

37:45.128 --> 37:47.790
- And this is the heart of our operations.

37:47.790 --> 37:50.520
5,000 servers humming along,

37:50.520 --> 37:54.963
controlling 85% of the
transactions all over the world.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.710
- 6,000 doing 90%.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.920
- Oh, ho ho ho, stand corrected.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.660
I'd like you to meet Danielson.

38:03.660 --> 38:05.941
He's the head of the operation.

38:05.941 --> 38:09.108
(somber guitar music)

38:13.110 --> 38:15.240
- Excuse me, I was curious.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.390
Could we have a moment?

38:17.430 --> 38:19.983
- [Deep Male Voice] Sir?
Uh, we have something.

38:21.853 --> 38:24.240
- Sure, I guess. is it important?

38:24.240 --> 38:25.373
- [Deep Male Voice] Maybe?

38:29.738 --> 38:33.155
(guitar music continues)

38:36.338 --> 38:39.088
(crashing sound)

38:42.109 --> 38:44.026
- What am I doing here?

38:45.720 --> 38:47.490
- I saw this, didn't know what it was.

38:47.490 --> 38:49.320
So I called up the chain of command.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.240
Didn't expect to see you.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.080
- Yeah. Good job.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.000
Yeah. This is right on power.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.280
A surge like this.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.810
How long did this get here?

38:57.810 --> 38:59.660
- [Tiffany] Wanna see something cool?

39:00.870 --> 39:04.230
- Okay. Okay.

39:04.230 --> 39:08.613
I am the CEO of the 9th biggest
company in the world, okay?

39:10.172 --> 39:12.780
(Computer noises)

39:12.780 --> 39:16.570
- Charlie, it's you.
What are you doing here?

39:17.597 --> 39:22.163
- It's a corporate tour
and I, I'm, I'm sorry,

39:23.850 --> 39:25.560
I'm so sorry.

39:25.560 --> 39:28.890
All these years, you know,

39:28.890 --> 39:33.198
the first year you were
all that I thought about

39:33.198 --> 39:35.913
and all the things that I
thought I would say to you,

39:37.648 --> 39:40.473
I forgot 'em, but I'm sorry.

39:41.638 --> 39:44.283
- My beloved. My beloved.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.280
- [Walker] Oh, so much time.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.260
I should be sad.

39:49.260 --> 39:51.343
- Don't be, don't be.

39:54.730 --> 39:55.833
- [Erin] Ahem, hey?

39:57.390 --> 39:58.223
- A woman?

39:59.488 --> 40:03.112
- Oh, she means nothing to me, mi a moire.

40:03.112 --> 40:04.243
(whispers) Sorry.

40:04.243 --> 40:05.880
- Okay.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.953
- A woman. It's always a woman.

40:12.054 --> 40:15.054
(keyboard clicking)

40:36.241 --> 40:37.074
(deep breath)

40:37.074 --> 40:39.000
- Boobs, breasts, mammary glands.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.200
Let me tell you something, Missy.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.540
I hate boobs. I hate 'em.

40:42.540 --> 40:43.740
I loathe them.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.180
I loathe women that think they can

40:45.180 --> 40:46.740
come up to me with boobs,

40:46.740 --> 40:49.470
that think they can marry me
and take my money with boobs.

40:49.470 --> 40:51.900
Is that what you think?
Is this her station?

40:51.900 --> 40:53.010
- Right?

40:53.010 --> 40:55.620
- That I could just ignore this.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.050
This is what caused our problem.

40:58.050 --> 40:59.910
To make me look like a fool?

40:59.910 --> 41:01.293
- Well.

41:04.050 --> 41:05.013
Thank you Willie.

41:07.560 --> 41:11.190
- Oh. I'm looking for room 35-4-34.

41:11.190 --> 41:12.040
- [Janitor] Yeah?

41:13.374 --> 41:16.350
- It's just. I don't know.

41:16.350 --> 41:19.015
- [Janitor] Important
stuff this time of night.

41:19.015 --> 41:22.080
- Well, you know, just the
fate of the world, whatever.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.580
This whole thing is so stupid.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.533
- [Janitor] It's called life.

41:26.922 --> 41:29.922
(keyboard clicking)

41:31.046 --> 41:34.296
(calming upbeat music)

41:51.390 --> 41:55.200
- We have multiple layers
of 12 point security.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.720
People in crypto say it. It's
impossible to brute force.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.393
what, what our company uses.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.000
- I, I'm sorry.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.190
This is all really fascinating,

42:08.190 --> 42:09.810
but I need to go to the bathroom.

42:09.810 --> 42:11.823
- Yeah, of course. Down the hall.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.353
You can use whichever one you like.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.460
- That's slightly patronizing.

42:20.460 --> 42:22.020
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:22.020 --> 42:22.950
I have a trans friend.

42:22.950 --> 42:24.750
- Well, why don't you talk about it.

42:26.428 --> 42:27.660
I'm, I'm sorry.

42:27.660 --> 42:31.470
I apologize. You know, this
is really new to me and I,

42:31.470 --> 42:35.940
I do get the snippet your
trying and I do appreciate it.

42:35.940 --> 42:36.773
- Yeah.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.881
(door opening)

42:45.881 --> 42:48.720
(door closing)

42:48.720 --> 42:50.280
- I'm free.

42:50.280 --> 42:53.610
I had to go places, dark places,

42:53.610 --> 42:55.923
but I'm free in more ways than one.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.610
- I've been alone in, in my bisexuality.

42:59.610 --> 43:01.500
It, it's not a sin.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.080
Just know that I'll cast her out.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.083
I'll sing only you my love, for you.

43:08.250 --> 43:12.120
Since we've been apart,
I've made millions.

43:12.120 --> 43:15.450
Why don't we leave this all
behind and move to Patagonia

43:15.450 --> 43:19.056
like we've always dreamed
and raised alpacas.

43:19.056 --> 43:20.760
- [Erin] Hey, I'm, I'm gonna,

43:20.760 --> 43:23.283
I'm gonna just leave you guys to it, okay.

43:26.550 --> 43:27.813
- Hey, I'm free.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.177
- Oh my God.

43:32.053 --> 43:33.750
I hate people like you.

43:33.750 --> 43:36.360
You think that because you work with me,

43:36.360 --> 43:38.490
you can just pretend to do your job.

43:38.490 --> 43:40.020
But this happened on your watch.

43:40.020 --> 43:42.060
This is your responsibility.

43:42.060 --> 43:44.820
And when we find out who did this,

43:44.820 --> 43:47.373
you're not gonna be here
because you're fired.

43:48.630 --> 43:51.930
Quit being on your phone.
You pathetic poor person.

43:51.930 --> 43:54.030
I hope you starve.

43:54.030 --> 43:54.993
- Sir.

43:56.370 --> 43:57.570
- [Richard Dawson] Yeah?

44:02.100 --> 44:04.710
- You want me to fly
right and scared straight.

44:04.710 --> 44:08.010
I'm not getting my job
back without speech.

44:08.010 --> 44:09.870
That's motivation.

44:09.870 --> 44:11.400
Not like I've had since 'Nam.

44:12.782 --> 44:14.010
- 'Nam?

44:14.010 --> 44:15.630
- That was where I was serving the rich.

44:15.630 --> 44:19.590
Even in our decadent
dreams, the total darkness,

44:19.590 --> 44:22.683
even darker than hell.
Blacker than any hell.

44:23.670 --> 44:25.520
Vietnam's a beautiful country though.

44:26.370 --> 44:28.803
- Whatever. Get on, you hippie.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.983
- Get this to Danielson.

44:34.020 --> 44:35.463
- Bri, it finally worked.

44:40.139 --> 44:41.520
(deep breath)

44:41.520 --> 44:42.770
- I feel a bit worked up.

44:46.980 --> 44:49.230
- [Janitor] Look, miss
whatever you're here for,

44:49.230 --> 44:50.280
I don't care.

44:50.280 --> 44:53.433
You could burn the whole
building down for all it matters.

44:54.418 --> 44:55.450
- I don't know.

44:55.450 --> 44:57.600
Okay. Do you wanna know?

44:57.600 --> 44:59.580
We're here to hack the main computer.

44:59.580 --> 45:01.620
Somehow, there's like
a program or something

45:01.620 --> 45:02.880
and then we're just gonna distribute money

45:02.880 --> 45:04.140
all over the world.

45:04.140 --> 45:06.750
The only thing is, it's nuts.

45:06.750 --> 45:08.160
I have no idea how this
is supposed to work. Like,

45:08.160 --> 45:10.320
are people supposed to
work or, or get food?

45:10.320 --> 45:12.930
The whole thing is so
dependent on the system.

45:12.930 --> 45:15.330
What is gonna replace it? I, I don't know.

45:15.330 --> 45:18.663
It's just so very, I don't know.

45:19.678 --> 45:21.450
(sighs)

45:21.450 --> 45:23.820
- Who were you telling this to?

45:23.820 --> 45:24.663
- Sorry.

45:26.460 --> 45:28.387
- Is that really how you feel?

45:29.380 --> 45:30.657
- Come on.

45:30.657 --> 45:33.210
You know this isn't gonna work.

45:33.210 --> 45:34.830
It's fun.

45:34.830 --> 45:36.873
I just don't want us to get hurt.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.003
- Whenever you're ready.

45:46.958 --> 45:51.281
- Sorry, I had to take care of something.

45:51.281 --> 45:52.290
I was wondering where you were.

45:52.290 --> 45:54.300
I think we found out what
caused the electrical thing.

45:54.300 --> 45:57.030
I was talking to the
CEO down in the center.

45:57.030 --> 45:59.340
- But, they're over there.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.240
- Let's head over.

46:01.237 --> 46:02.070
- Yeah.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.700
- Well if you're not
going to bring the world

46:05.700 --> 46:08.940
to total anarchy, I am.

46:08.940 --> 46:10.140
- I'm sorry.

46:10.140 --> 46:12.423
- Don't you remember the good times?

46:13.688 --> 46:16.688
(funky disco music)

46:25.352 --> 46:26.185
- Yeah. It's mainly us hanging
at the pool in our bikinis.

46:28.710 --> 46:31.260
- Yeah. And that's what I'm fighting for.

46:31.260 --> 46:35.133
So everyone can go to the
pool, in their bikinis.

46:36.317 --> 46:38.340
That's gonna be pure magic.

46:38.340 --> 46:40.650
- I told you I'm not magic.

46:40.650 --> 46:43.800
- Sorry I was speaking metaphorically.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.633
- It's okay.

46:45.973 --> 46:49.223
(dramatic tonal music)

47:27.930 --> 47:28.830
- [Richard] Sorry.

47:30.340 --> 47:32.850
(computer noises)

47:32.850 --> 47:34.750
- You're right. Not very professional.

47:36.720 --> 47:39.830
- You have a good man
here. We have a lot of...

47:42.367 --> 47:44.283
- You know what, take a minute.

47:45.870 --> 47:47.250
That CEO, when he came in here,

47:47.250 --> 47:48.483
he was with a broad.

47:50.670 --> 47:52.670
Show him the boardroom when you're done.

47:55.532 --> 47:58.532
(keyboard clicking)

48:00.005 --> 48:02.588
(mellow music)

48:35.237 --> 48:36.319
- How's your night?

48:36.319 --> 48:39.247
- Oh, a little unusual but not bad.

48:39.247 --> 48:40.080
- You okay?

48:40.080 --> 48:42.180
- Yeah. Just you know,
my head's a little sore.

48:42.180 --> 48:43.608
I got hit a while back.

48:43.608 --> 48:44.790
- Oh, it's a shame.

48:44.790 --> 48:45.805
- Yeah.

48:45.805 --> 48:48.540
(metal clangs)

48:48.540 --> 48:49.373
- Sorry.

48:55.860 --> 48:59.343
- Still locked. Well guess we're done.

49:00.300 --> 49:01.813
- Really? That's it?

49:03.398 --> 49:07.443
- Well, you can make this not work.

49:08.819 --> 49:11.069
Or, you can make it an
internal (indistinct).

49:12.780 --> 49:13.803
Not both.

49:15.437 --> 49:17.040
- I'm, I'm gonna get some water.

49:17.040 --> 49:17.883
- Suit yourself.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.713
- Sorry. Rent-a-pig, enjoy.

49:27.122 --> 49:29.027
He's probably gonna get fired.

49:32.310 --> 49:36.480
- So much is going wrong.
There's a major security breach.

49:36.480 --> 49:39.363
There's people on multiple
tours. I am in hot water.

49:42.450 --> 49:44.550
- You look so tense.

49:44.550 --> 49:45.900
- Huh?

49:45.900 --> 49:47.900
- Why don't I distract you a little bit?

49:51.645 --> 49:52.866
(water trickling)

49:52.866 --> 49:55.283
(Erin gasps)

49:58.200 --> 49:59.033
- Oops.

50:01.373 --> 50:02.893
- Oh my God.

50:02.893 --> 50:04.133
We're here.

50:04.133 --> 50:04.966
- Yeah.

50:06.313 --> 50:09.630
- I expected it to be more, I don't know,

50:09.630 --> 50:10.563
fancy?

50:11.670 --> 50:12.810
- I'm sure he has something.

50:12.810 --> 50:15.480
But, you know what I've
noticed with the powerful,

50:15.480 --> 50:19.200
they seem to have less
developed aesthetics.

50:19.200 --> 50:22.470
Like sure they aspire to wealth
and like giant mansions and

50:22.470 --> 50:26.040
sophistication paintings
by Monet and trophy wives.

50:26.040 --> 50:28.296
But they don't seem to appreciate

50:28.296 --> 50:30.393
the beauty in front of them.

50:31.740 --> 50:33.033
Right in front of them.

50:35.905 --> 50:36.738
- Yeah.

50:36.738 --> 50:38.040
- [Lana] I'm sorry.

50:38.040 --> 50:39.033
- It's all right.

50:40.470 --> 50:42.120
- Question.

50:42.120 --> 50:42.953
- Yes?

50:42.953 --> 50:47.953
- So we are in the office of
the ninth most powerful CEO

50:48.060 --> 50:48.933
in the world.

50:50.070 --> 50:51.620
Do you wanna do it on his desk?

50:53.594 --> 50:57.094
(triumphant upbeat music)

51:02.894 --> 51:05.561
(girls moaning)

51:06.595 --> 51:09.180
- I'm sorry, my top keeps
coming up and you fainted.

51:09.180 --> 51:10.893
- That's probably my head wound.

51:12.391 --> 51:13.980
(kissing noise)

51:13.980 --> 51:15.093
- That made my night.

51:16.521 --> 51:19.354
(Tiffany giggles)

51:22.080 --> 51:23.670
- Do you want some coffee, sir?

51:23.670 --> 51:25.230
- It's 10:00 PM.

51:25.230 --> 51:28.233
- Burning the midnight
oil. It's so viscous.

51:30.420 --> 51:31.380
- What is it?

51:31.380 --> 51:32.493
- Not quite sure.

51:33.690 --> 51:34.800
Sorry.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.970
- I know you're married to your work.

51:35.970 --> 51:37.020
I should be.

51:37.020 --> 51:39.660
I've built my entire
corporation without your shadow.

51:39.660 --> 51:40.760
I have papers to sign.

51:42.570 --> 51:43.620
- Don't be like that.

51:46.844 --> 51:48.352
(heavy breathing)

51:48.352 --> 51:51.102
(kissing noises)

51:53.244 --> 51:57.822
(triumphant music intensifies)

51:57.822 --> 52:00.239
(indistinct)

52:03.300 --> 52:04.265
- Who are you?

52:04.265 --> 52:05.098
(music abruptly stops)

52:05.098 --> 52:07.430
- What are your...

52:13.096 --> 52:13.950
(techno music starts)

52:13.950 --> 52:15.797
- [Willie] Oh gee, oh gee, oh gee!

52:18.129 --> 52:20.777
(rustling noises)

52:20.777 --> 52:23.860
- Girls in trouble, girls in trouble!

52:27.758 --> 52:30.426
- Gotta help, gotta help!

52:30.426 --> 52:31.376
- [High Pitched Squealing
Voice] Oh no, oh no,

52:31.376 --> 52:34.126
what else, I think you need help.

52:40.860 --> 52:41.850
- You're just a woman.

52:41.850 --> 52:42.813
- I have friends.

52:43.710 --> 52:44.583
- Karate chop.

52:46.110 --> 52:47.760
- I know Kung Fu.

52:47.760 --> 52:50.100
- But didn't you say karate chop?

52:50.100 --> 52:53.490
- You know Kung Fu comes
from the Chinese tradition,

52:53.490 --> 52:54.660
but really in Chinese,

52:54.660 --> 52:58.122
it means any martial art
form of combat. NINJA FLAP!

52:58.122 --> 53:00.955
(explosion sound)

53:04.800 --> 53:08.070
- Well, I have something at
the front desk to attend to.

53:08.070 --> 53:09.720
You can handle this right?

53:09.720 --> 53:11.250
- Me?

53:11.250 --> 53:13.070
- Anyway, you have the hard drive.

53:14.290 --> 53:16.473
- Yeah, but how do I log in?

53:19.353 --> 53:20.186
(heavy breathing)

53:20.186 --> 53:21.030
(moaning)

53:21.030 --> 53:23.820
- Oh, he didn't even log off.

53:23.820 --> 53:24.933
- You can do this.

53:27.030 --> 53:28.290
Okay.

53:28.290 --> 53:31.173
If there's any questions,
he wrote his passwords down.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.073
- Where's my top?

53:39.360 --> 53:40.620
- What could it be?

53:40.620 --> 53:43.080
- It's probably just a shorted fuse.

53:43.080 --> 53:45.780
The electrical all went
out because of some short,

53:45.780 --> 53:48.090
cheap electrical fuse.

53:48.090 --> 53:49.323
That's nothing unusual.

53:50.304 --> 53:53.130
Tonight's just so strange.

53:53.130 --> 53:57.120
But the true strangeness is finding out

53:57.120 --> 53:59.170
what I might have thought I lost forever.

54:02.010 --> 54:04.503
- Do I really wanna change
the fate of the world?

54:08.970 --> 54:10.191
Hello?

54:10.191 --> 54:11.070
- [Male Voice On Phone] Hey Sarah?

54:11.070 --> 54:11.903
- Yes.

54:11.903 --> 54:14.130
- This is Mike at Funicular Post Studios.

54:14.130 --> 54:15.700
We worked last year.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.910
- Oh, yeah?

54:17.910 --> 54:19.350
- [Mike] I was wondering.

54:19.350 --> 54:22.500
Well, we're getting a
project in next week.

54:22.500 --> 54:24.330
It's called Clown College.

54:24.330 --> 54:28.140
It's a 30 minute reality show on TXC.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.730
Need someone to log the footage,

54:29.730 --> 54:32.670
work with the associates
to get a rough edit in.

54:32.670 --> 54:34.680
It's a total of eight episodes.

54:34.680 --> 54:37.950
Hoping you could do two over a month.

54:37.950 --> 54:42.450
- Um, I don't know. Can I think about it?

54:42.450 --> 54:44.220
Can I tell you tomorrow?

54:44.220 --> 54:45.990
- It's pretty much what it sounds like.

54:45.990 --> 54:48.510
Honestly, from what I've seen,
the footage is pretty eh,

54:48.510 --> 54:50.253
but it's a good opportunity.

54:54.720 --> 54:55.553
- We're good.

54:57.026 --> 54:57.859
Good.

55:06.210 --> 55:09.150
- Well at least it's an
excuse to see each other.

55:09.150 --> 55:10.950
- [Deep Male Voice] Sir,
something is happening

55:10.950 --> 55:11.913
in the system.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.380
- Sir, we just want to chat for a second.

55:16.380 --> 55:19.200
Did someone install a program
called Updating your Computer?

55:19.200 --> 55:21.270
- [Richard Dawson] Someone? It's me.

55:21.270 --> 55:22.740
Yes.

55:22.740 --> 55:24.210
- A little unusual. I know.

55:24.210 --> 55:27.960
But the CEO of Atlantic
requested it, make him happy,

55:27.960 --> 55:29.110
you know where it goes.

55:30.660 --> 55:32.250
- But I'm with the CEO of Atlantic.

55:32.250 --> 55:34.170
- Well then they know all about it.

55:34.170 --> 55:36.270
It's nothing unusual,
so don't worry about it.

55:36.270 --> 55:40.053
It's not a problem. And we can
talk about the rest tomorrow.

55:42.330 --> 55:44.133
- Don't worry about all that.

55:45.090 --> 55:47.883
Worry about the olive
trees and the pampas,

55:48.960 --> 55:52.923
how they'll blow through
your hair like my fingertips.

55:55.800 --> 55:58.680
- [Deep Male Voice] Sir. Should
we do something about it?

55:58.680 --> 55:59.513
Sir?

56:01.650 --> 56:03.240
- Everyone get out then.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.440
- [Sarah] And we did in.

56:05.460 --> 56:09.180
In the movies, there's getaway
drivers and car chases,

56:09.180 --> 56:12.000
but in real life it was
actually pretty easy.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.390
As for our plan, I don't
know when they got wind,

56:15.390 --> 56:17.313
it was too late for them to stop us.

56:20.430 --> 56:23.857
- Wow. $50,000.

56:24.916 --> 56:26.475
(triumphant music)

56:26.475 --> 56:28.058
Wow! A free bikini!

56:31.883 --> 56:34.893
Wow, half off ice cream at McDonald's!

56:44.271 --> 56:47.271
(keyboard clicking)

56:54.704 --> 56:58.454
(triumphant music continues)

57:26.189 --> 57:28.530
- [Sarah] I didn't know how
long this all would last.

57:28.530 --> 57:30.540
There was a paper trail unfortunately,

57:30.540 --> 57:33.750
and I'm sure the powers that
would be would sort it all out

57:33.750 --> 57:35.580
in some short order.

57:35.580 --> 57:38.160
But for a brief glimmer of a moment,

57:38.160 --> 57:42.952
the world saw something,
something magical and free.

57:42.952 --> 57:45.513
And what more could you really ask?

57:49.140 --> 57:50.940
- This is a disaster.

57:50.940 --> 57:52.410
- Sir.

57:52.410 --> 57:53.850
- I don't even mean the money.

57:53.850 --> 57:57.570
The entire system is
dependent on complete control.

57:57.570 --> 57:58.950
Rationing.

57:58.950 --> 58:02.703
The bearest rationing of
money and power. With this?

58:03.660 --> 58:08.223
My God, they will rise up,
brother against brother.

58:09.570 --> 58:10.953
By the way, you're fired.

58:11.962 --> 58:14.490
(guitar music starts)

58:14.490 --> 58:15.810
- That's okay.

58:15.810 --> 58:19.620
I've decided to move to
Argentina to be with my beloved.

58:19.620 --> 58:21.600
- How great. You're not even angry.

58:21.600 --> 58:23.640
This is the worst.

58:23.640 --> 58:27.030
Poor people are animals. Animals.

58:27.030 --> 58:28.100
And all...

58:30.463 --> 58:31.296
Wait.

58:32.325 --> 58:35.325
(keyboard clicking)

58:44.685 --> 58:47.852
(upbeat techno music)

59:32.007 --> 59:33.257
- Thanks OBSEC!

59:35.095 --> 59:37.928
(water splashing)

59:43.123 --> 59:44.905
- I found a man.

59:44.905 --> 59:47.355
I think I only gave him
this slight brain damage.

59:49.110 --> 59:50.820
- The sex thing, you know,
it's kinda embarrassing,

59:50.820 --> 59:52.020
but at least it's funny.

59:53.190 --> 59:54.780
- I remember that time I
helped that little girl

59:54.780 --> 59:56.040
out of the fire.

59:56.040 --> 59:57.810
- When did that happen?

59:57.810 --> 59:59.580
- Maybe that's just how I remember it.

59:59.580 --> 1:00:01.173
Or maybe that's how I died.

1:00:07.221 --> 1:00:08.932
(ominous music)

1:00:08.932 --> 1:00:11.765
(water splashing)

1:00:12.612 --> 1:00:13.945
- Oh, hello sir.

1:00:17.273 --> 1:00:19.277
This is our house. How can we help you?

1:00:21.776 --> 1:00:22.693
Okay. Okay.

1:00:24.180 --> 1:00:25.930
- You didn't leave much of a trail.

1:00:27.300 --> 1:00:30.693
It was a trick to find you,
but you did leave something.

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:36.570
- Oops. Shouldn't have left that top.

1:00:36.570 --> 1:00:38.370
- Does this look familiar?

1:00:38.370 --> 1:00:39.862
- [Lana] Sit. Have some alask.

1:00:39.862 --> 1:00:42.053
We're celebrating the end of capitalism!

1:00:42.053 --> 1:00:45.153
- Alask is not a champagne.

1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:50.367
It's a separate French
traditional sparkling wine.

1:00:50.367 --> 1:00:53.128
- [Lana] Oh. Oh, thank you
sir for mansplaining that.

1:00:53.128 --> 1:00:55.920
(techno music escalating)

1:00:55.920 --> 1:00:58.890
- Don't play dumb. You know what you did,

1:00:58.890 --> 1:01:00.183
and you're gonna pay.

1:01:02.058 --> 1:01:03.993
- I don't see no police.

1:01:03.993 --> 1:01:05.550
- Oh, I don't need the police.

1:01:05.550 --> 1:01:07.680
They'll just arrest you.

1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:09.093
Put you on trial.

1:01:10.470 --> 1:01:11.520
- Justice.

1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:13.070
- Oh, it has its value I guess.

1:01:15.330 --> 1:01:16.713
But people are gonna watch.

1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:20.730
See you smile.

1:01:20.730 --> 1:01:22.620
Yeah, I know that smile.

1:01:22.620 --> 1:01:23.913
Get ideas.

1:01:25.470 --> 1:01:27.750
Any evidence I bring up, you go to jail,

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:31.350
40 years, a hero. That's not gonna happen.

1:01:31.350 --> 1:01:35.223
Your end is going to be painful.

1:01:38.250 --> 1:01:40.110
- This wine is quite good, no?

1:01:40.110 --> 1:01:42.750
Any case, I've taken all your money.

1:01:42.750 --> 1:01:44.731
Well, at least most of it.

1:01:44.731 --> 1:01:48.930
What else? Your power,
your wife, your family.

1:01:48.930 --> 1:01:52.473
- I am going to personally watch.

1:01:53.768 --> 1:01:56.370
- Well, we also have this information.

1:01:56.370 --> 1:01:59.897
It's quite funny, you know,
the companies you work for.

1:01:59.897 --> 1:02:01.833
I mean you lost them trillions.

1:02:04.387 --> 1:02:07.983
Well, prior to that you
were also skimming money,

1:02:09.510 --> 1:02:11.733
taking pennies from every transaction.

1:02:12.660 --> 1:02:14.913
And you promised total security.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:17.630
Well, you know,

1:02:17.630 --> 1:02:22.072
I know that you sold that
information to people to cheap.

1:02:22.072 --> 1:02:24.753
Insider trading quite
a bit. Don't you think?

1:02:26.430 --> 1:02:27.263
The thing is,

1:02:27.263 --> 1:02:30.077
with such a closed system,
that put produces leaks.

1:02:30.077 --> 1:02:33.330
And that is how we found out about it.

1:02:33.330 --> 1:02:36.789
And if anything happens to
us, anyone in this group,

1:02:36.789 --> 1:02:39.150
the least bit suspicious,

1:02:39.150 --> 1:02:43.140
I'm gonna tell someone, and
they're gonna tell people,

1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:44.626
relevant people.

1:02:44.626 --> 1:02:48.690
And you know, I mean we're
talking about billions.

1:02:48.690 --> 1:02:52.473
They might go to the police, or maybe.

1:02:56.418 --> 1:02:58.560
- You little bitch!

1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:02.893
You think you're so smart.
You think because ah,

1:03:03.792 --> 1:03:04.625
(high pitched jibberish)

1:03:04.625 --> 1:03:07.080
Just type it away and
I've got me by the balls.

1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:12.080
But you don't know what I'm
capable of you little bitch!

1:03:16.352 --> 1:03:19.163
(water splashing)

1:03:19.163 --> 1:03:21.913
(girls cackling)

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:24.270
- Question.

1:03:24.270 --> 1:03:25.103
- Yeah.

1:03:25.103 --> 1:03:26.790
- Was all of this an elaborate effort

1:03:26.790 --> 1:03:29.192
to make me fall in love with you?

1:03:29.192 --> 1:03:30.025
- Maybe?

1:03:31.462 --> 1:03:33.210
Did it work?

1:03:33.210 --> 1:03:34.043
- Yes.

1:03:35.441 --> 1:03:38.191
(kissing noises)
