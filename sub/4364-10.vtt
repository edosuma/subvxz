WEBVTT

00:02.662 --> 00:05.314
Then there can be no question who is
next in line for the throne.

00:05.523 --> 00:07.703
Prince Richard must flee secretly
to Flanders.

00:07.801 --> 00:10.120
We must find a boy that's
the very image of you.

00:10.121 --> 00:12.040
Just by living,
they are a threat to us.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.680
Would you wish them killed?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.120
I do wish it.

00:15.121 --> 00:18.160
This is your plan to put your son on
the throne.

00:18.161 --> 00:21.720
If the princes are dead,
then he is two steps closer.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.040
Obviously the men must kill them.

00:24.041 --> 00:27.440
Edward? They're gone.
They've just vanished!

00:27.441 --> 00:31.960
I do not know what I have done.
What if I killed two little boys?!

00:31.961 --> 00:34.600
Whoever took our first-born son,

00:34.601 --> 00:40.280
you will take his first-born son
from him and his grandsons too.

00:40.281 --> 00:42.520
The older girls will come to court.

00:42.521 --> 00:45.320
I want to keep Princess Elizabeth
close to me.

00:45.321 --> 00:48.360
What are you doing?
They are witches!

00:48.361 --> 00:51.080
Henry must strengthen his claim,
marry well.

00:51.081 --> 00:54.520
Princess Elizabeth. Lady Margaret
says that such a marriage would unite

00:54.521 --> 00:57.280
the Houses of York and Lancaster
and end these wars.

00:57.281 --> 00:58.880
Dear Henry and Jasper.

00:58.881 --> 01:01.920
We must make ready.
I think this is our moment.

01:01.921 --> 01:04.319
He has his army and he will not
waste it.

01:04.321 --> 01:07.040
Well, I take it I no longer need to
marry Tudor?

01:07.041 --> 01:10.200
I've written to Lady Margaret
that your betrothal still stands.

01:10.201 --> 01:11.880
I will not marry him, Mother!

01:11.881 --> 01:13.676
Fortune will send me someone else.

Are you sending words of joy,
Margaret?

02:39.721 --> 02:41.240
No.

02:41.241 --> 02:44.440
I'm writing to Henry that he must
sail again soon as he's able

02:44.441 --> 02:46.080
and take his rightful throne.

02:46.081 --> 02:50.240
Do you not think that God has ruled
against your plan

02:50.241 --> 02:54.240
to make your Henry king by pinning
him in Brittany and locking you up
here?

02:54.241 --> 02:56.960
It was you who caused us to fail.

02:56.961 --> 02:59.161
You and that witch.

03:00.641 --> 03:04.880
She's lucky I have not revoked her
bastard daughter's betrothal
to Henry.

03:04.881 --> 03:08.160
Hm. My only consolation is that
Elizabeth

03:08.161 --> 03:12.161
is also a prisoner in the darkness
of the Abbey. No, she's not.

03:15.801 --> 03:19.000
Richard's reached an accord with her
and she's been freed.

03:19.001 --> 03:22.160
Her older girls are going to court.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.161
You and your son have been
disregarded.

03:25.801 --> 03:33.720
God... has chosen York and Rivers
after all.

03:33.721 --> 03:36.720
Margaret. Margaret! Teddy!

03:36.721 --> 03:40.521
Edward, where are your clothes?!
I'm hot.

03:42.361 --> 03:45.080
You're burning up.
You must be put to bed at once.

03:45.081 --> 03:47.081
No! Lady Mother, please!
We're playing. Anne?

03:49.321 --> 03:52.361
Edward has another fever.
He's just been running around.

04:02.481 --> 04:06.600
My spies tell me that Henry Tudor's
declared that he is King of England

04:06.601 --> 04:09.760
and announced his betrothal to
Princess Elizabeth.

04:09.761 --> 04:12.000
She is no princess! Hm.

04:12.001 --> 04:16.320
He claims that in her,
he will unite York and Lancaster

04:16.321 --> 04:18.480
and end these wars.

04:18.481 --> 04:21.000
If I am to suffer her here at court

04:21.000 --> 04:23.960
then we shall call her
by her proper name -

04:23.961 --> 04:25.681
the bastard girl Elizabeth!

04:29.161 --> 04:32.000
The disappearance of the princes
has only made him bolder

04:32.001 --> 04:35.361
and now he will invade
the very first moment he can.

04:40.721 --> 04:42.401
Your Grace.

04:46.121 --> 04:48.121
Edward. Edward!

04:51.001 --> 04:52.520
Come, come.

04:52.521 --> 04:54.200
He is still very hot.

04:54.201 --> 04:57.800
How long has Edward been like this?
This is the second fever. Father.

04:57.801 --> 04:59.681
Father!

05:03.241 --> 05:04.841
Hush, hush.

05:34.241 --> 05:35.801
Mistress Elizabeth.

05:39.081 --> 05:41.720
Cecily.

05:41.721 --> 05:44.561
You will find me an easy queen to
serve.

05:46.921 --> 05:49.001
Unlike others before me.

07:04.361 --> 07:06.041
What is he doing?

07:48.441 --> 07:51.520
Do you intend to tell me what's made
you so exhilarated?

07:51.521 --> 07:55.561
You would never guess.
It's too... juicy.

07:57.321 --> 08:02.440
I thank God I'm not attached to
worldly goods or I might resent you
drinking all my wine.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.721
Your heartfelt generosity makes me
drink it quicker!

08:08.721 --> 08:10.601
Is this about Henry's campaign?

08:12.321 --> 08:13.841
Campaign?!

08:17.841 --> 08:20.800
It looks as though your boy has lost
the Rivers' affinity so he may

08:20.801 --> 08:23.960
as well just settle down in Brittany
with a nice fat peasant girl.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.560
What do you mean, has lost it?!

08:25.561 --> 08:29.040
Because they will back him only by
his marriage to Princess Elizabeth.

08:29.041 --> 08:32.039
And... now she has a suitor.

08:32.041 --> 08:34.600
A suitor!

08:34.601 --> 08:38.601
Some grubby page?
No nobleman would marry her.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.961
Who's the fool?

08:44.441 --> 08:46.321
King Richard.

08:53.401 --> 08:56.800
He's her uncle!

08:56.801 --> 09:00.000
And he's married! To a woman who
is barren, whose son is weak,

09:00.001 --> 09:03.120
but God knows this new catch
should be fertile,

09:03.121 --> 09:06.681
judging by her mother's performance
in the marriage bed of England.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.000
He doesn't mean to marry her!

09:11.001 --> 09:14.720
He means to shame her as a whore
to humiliate my son!

09:14.721 --> 09:18.760
I don't think he does. It looks to
me like he's truly in love.

09:18.761 --> 09:21.400
Well, then you are as foolish
as she's wicked.

09:21.401 --> 09:23.960
Does she return these feelings?

09:23.961 --> 09:27.640
She loves him, body and soul.

09:27.641 --> 09:30.960
Oh! Well, then she is a whore!
Though why should that surprise me?

09:30.961 --> 09:33.001
I've lost my appetite.

09:46.921 --> 09:50.080
Go! Go!

09:50.081 --> 09:51.801
Get out!

10:06.881 --> 10:09.440
I want the Rivers' girls to leave.

10:09.441 --> 10:11.880
I will not have them here.

10:11.881 --> 10:15.120
They are your nieces, Anne.
Why are you against them?

10:15.121 --> 10:18.000
Because my boy is ill, that's why!

10:18.001 --> 10:22.800
You said yourself she and her mother
laid a curse on whoever
killed the princes.

10:22.801 --> 10:27.400
We are not guilty for whatever fate
befell the boys!

10:27.401 --> 10:29.920
But what if it was us?

10:29.921 --> 10:33.640
By accident, just by putting them
in the Tower at all!

10:33.641 --> 10:36.801
What if someone thought we wanted
it? We did not want it!

10:41.441 --> 10:43.441
Anne.

10:44.721 --> 10:48.841
I know you think I desire my niece.

10:52.521 --> 10:56.880
But the truth is... she is betrothed
to Henry Tudor.

10:56.881 --> 11:00.921
So who is the fool if I am bedding
her? If people think that I am
bedding her?

11:02.641 --> 11:07.480
The world will see that she is not
with Tudor but with me,

11:07.481 --> 11:11.360
and all the men who would fight for
her because they loved her father

11:11.361 --> 11:14.000
will come to my side...

11:14.001 --> 11:16.280
and not to Tudor's.

11:16.281 --> 11:21.441
So just to win your point with him,
you would dishonour me?

11:22.921 --> 11:24.801
To win a war against him...

11:28.401 --> 11:30.721
I will play whatever cards I must.

11:33.721 --> 11:35.920
'And how are our numbers
in the north?'

11:35.921 --> 11:37.720
We are many.

11:37.721 --> 11:40.840
Enough are loyal to make us strong?

11:40.841 --> 11:42.521
With ease, my lord.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.880
Princess Elizabeth?

11:51.881 --> 11:53.841
May I walk you in to dine?

12:08.001 --> 12:11.241
Your Grace? Might I have the honour?

12:14.361 --> 12:16.240
My Lady! My Lady Anne!

12:16.241 --> 12:18.920
Margaret? What is it?
He said he was hot.

12:18.921 --> 12:21.760
But we were playing
and then I fell asleep.

12:21.761 --> 12:23.321
Oh, no! No! Richard!

12:41.921 --> 12:43.561
Oh, my baby! Edward! Edward.

12:45.041 --> 12:49.120
Edward? Is there pain? Tell me.

12:49.121 --> 12:52.201
Help him, Richard! Help him!
I don't know how to help him!

12:53.761 --> 12:55.881
Richard, save him! Please! Help him!

13:00.481 --> 13:02.041
My son.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.081
I command you to breathe!

13:07.761 --> 13:10.161
I am the King
and you will breathe for me!

13:12.801 --> 13:14.641
Edward!

13:18.041 --> 13:19.601
My boy!

13:50.641 --> 13:53.481
Oh, God! My boy!

13:54.801 --> 13:56.560
My Edward!

13:56.561 --> 13:58.361
Anne?

14:16.761 --> 14:18.281
Uncle Richard?

14:43.481 --> 14:47.601
Lady Anne, please.
Please, let me help you.

14:54.641 --> 14:56.481
My father in battle.

14:58.281 --> 14:59.881
Izzy to her poisoner.

15:02.161 --> 15:05.160
My baby to her curse.

15:05.161 --> 15:06.680
Anne, please.

15:06.681 --> 15:09.400
A witch's curse is all it could be.

15:09.401 --> 15:12.760
When the weak years of his boyhood
were behind him.

15:12.761 --> 15:15.841
Anne, I need you. Please.

15:28.681 --> 15:30.401
My son is gone.

15:35.841 --> 15:37.760
Then we must have another.

15:37.761 --> 15:40.041
After ten full years of trying?

15:42.001 --> 15:45.201
There is no point in touching me.
There is no point.

15:56.361 --> 15:58.721
Not even for love?

16:01.401 --> 16:03.281
You do not love me.

16:05.761 --> 16:09.560
Even at our own son's funeral
you went to her.

16:09.561 --> 16:12.600
She came to me because you would not.

16:12.601 --> 16:16.280
You killed those boys...
and lied to me.

16:16.281 --> 16:18.161
This is proof of it.

16:20.201 --> 16:21.241
I...

16:23.041 --> 16:24.441
I didn't.

16:54.241 --> 16:57.000
'To my daughter Elizabeth.

16:57.001 --> 17:00.441
'I hear news of Prince Edward's
death and I'm troubled by it.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.121
'Do you think it is
the working of our curse?

17:13.641 --> 17:16.000
'I know you do not want to
marry Henry Tudor,

17:16.001 --> 17:19.119
'but he will come now Richard
no longer has an heir.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.520
'And if Richard is the murderer
of our boys,

17:21.521 --> 17:23.201
'then we cannot side with him.'

17:33.281 --> 17:34.961
I'm in love with you.

18:05.881 --> 18:07.641
Lady Mother!

18:17.241 --> 18:19.160
The Court is treating you well?

18:19.161 --> 18:23.360
That necklace is almost as grand
as mine was when I was queen.

18:23.361 --> 18:25.400
The court is treating her very well.

18:25.401 --> 18:29.240
Be quiet... Cecily.

18:29.241 --> 18:33.240
How is your uncle, the King?
Is he grieving still?

18:33.241 --> 18:35.840
Oh, he's found some comfort.

18:35.841 --> 18:37.920
Hasn't he, Lizzie?
Now, that's enough.

18:37.921 --> 18:40.360
Thomas, take the little ones.
Cecily, you too.

18:40.361 --> 18:43.441
Mother... I would like to speak to
Elizabeth on my own.

18:55.121 --> 18:57.520
Well?

18:57.521 --> 18:59.680
Is it Richard?

18:59.681 --> 19:01.801
What has happened between you?

19:05.321 --> 19:07.400
Mother, he...

19:07.401 --> 19:11.121
He isn't the tyrant that people
think he is. He's wonderful!

19:13.001 --> 19:18.041
And Queen Anne isn't well and
Richard needs an heir for England.

19:20.161 --> 19:24.160
He asked me if I thought that
our boys might have got away.

19:24.161 --> 19:27.560
Because then... You are not allowed
to tell him about your brother
Richard!

19:27.561 --> 19:29.961
You promise me that.
Of course not.

19:31.401 --> 19:33.720
But he didn't kill them.

19:33.721 --> 19:36.440
Mother, he had
nothing to do with it.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.081
I'm certain of that.

19:41.841 --> 19:44.440
So how far has this...
gone between you?

19:44.441 --> 19:46.601
I take it there is gossip?

19:49.681 --> 19:52.760
He says that he loves me.

19:52.761 --> 19:58.161
Hm. He says that he will
put Anne aside and marry me.

20:00.761 --> 20:05.080
And if he does... I will be
Queen of England.

20:05.081 --> 20:07.041
Hm.

20:14.241 --> 20:15.520
'Dear Henry and Jasper,

20:15.521 --> 20:18.080
'it is hard for me to write to you
as I'm spied on,

20:18.081 --> 20:19.720
'but everything has changed here.

20:19.721 --> 20:23.321
'Richard's son is dead
and he no longer has an heir.

20:27.881 --> 20:31.601
'You must make ready with your army
and prepare to sail from France.

20:35.641 --> 20:39.760
'You must kill Richard now
before he has another son.

20:39.761 --> 20:42.841
'Then the York line will be
ended... for ever.'

20:44.441 --> 20:47.400
When Charles said we could swell
an army from his prisons,

20:47.401 --> 20:50.520
I hoped it would be
a better crop than this!

20:50.521 --> 20:53.840
We'll make it work, Henry.

20:53.841 --> 20:55.681
Right?

21:26.601 --> 21:32.040
The French have sided with Tudor.
They have given him an army.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.801
It is not over. I must make ready.

21:45.961 --> 21:47.881
That silk is beautiful.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.521
It would suit our niece, Elizabeth.

21:52.801 --> 21:55.600
You mean to compare us now
in matching gowns?

21:55.601 --> 22:00.320
Anne, you know the reason I must do
this. Do I, Richard? Truly?

22:00.321 --> 22:03.720
My love... you are not well.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.880
You must go to bed.

22:05.881 --> 22:09.481
They say you will put me aside and
marry her. Who told you that?

22:15.281 --> 22:17.881
Tudor will invade this spring.

22:20.201 --> 22:23.321
I must cut the York and Rivers'
affinity away from him.

22:26.081 --> 22:30.920
Take care you do not cut the Neville
affinity away from yourself.

22:30.921 --> 22:34.120
I am the Kingmaker's daughter

22:34.121 --> 22:38.520
and many in the north
only follow you for love of me.

22:38.521 --> 22:41.481
They'll turn against you
if they think you shame me.

22:44.121 --> 22:45.601
I know that.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.960
'To my wife.

23:21.961 --> 23:24.160
'The York Princess
commands the court,

23:24.161 --> 23:27.040
'but many share your view that
Richard has seduced his niece

23:27.041 --> 23:30.161
'only to show your son Henry
as a helpless cuckold.

23:32.601 --> 23:35.200
'He's a laughing stock
and no-one now believes

23:35.201 --> 23:37.841
'he can unite
the Houses of York and Lancaster.

23:40.481 --> 23:43.200
'Tell me, has he any other weapons
in his arsenal,

23:43.201 --> 23:45.480
'or should we get you
kitted out in white

23:45.481 --> 23:50.121
'with your saint's knees in the dirt
before the King to beg forgiveness?'

24:07.121 --> 24:09.000
I've won.

24:09.001 --> 24:11.880
The York affinity are all with me,

24:11.881 --> 24:19.200
so Tudor must call on Lancaster
alone to swell up his convict army.

24:19.201 --> 24:21.720
The girl has done her work.

24:21.721 --> 24:27.281
But you have ruined her
and she is known as broken meats.

24:31.361 --> 24:34.641
There is a price to pay
if you venture near the throne.

24:36.521 --> 24:41.281
She knows that. I have fought
too hard to be King.

24:42.561 --> 24:44.561
I will not give it up for Tudor.

24:45.721 --> 24:48.401
I wish I could go back and never
have been Queen.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.601
Anne?

25:27.441 --> 25:29.281
No!

25:30.641 --> 25:32.361
Please!

25:36.081 --> 25:38.401
Anne, what is it?

25:51.201 --> 25:54.560
Lady Anne. Your Grace.

25:54.561 --> 25:56.401
Sir Robert.

25:59.041 --> 26:04.200
I asked you once
about Elizabeth's sons,

26:04.201 --> 26:07.841
the princes, and told you we
wouldn't be safe...

26:09.961 --> 26:12.201
until they were dead.

26:21.201 --> 26:23.441
I'm dying, Sir Robert.

26:25.241 --> 26:28.761
And I need to know
what I must confess.

26:30.761 --> 26:32.721
Did you act upon what I said?

26:33.961 --> 26:35.841
Did you kill the boys?

26:39.921 --> 26:41.441
No.

26:44.641 --> 26:47.040
They are not dead?

26:47.041 --> 26:48.961
I would not know, Your Grace.

26:50.121 --> 26:53.441
I can tell you only that they
were not killed on my watch.

26:56.601 --> 26:58.841
My conscience is clear, then.

27:00.041 --> 27:01.921
And so is mine.

27:35.761 --> 27:37.241
Mother.

27:43.361 --> 27:46.481
Girls, go inside.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.401
Something... very strange
is happening.

27:54.081 --> 27:56.481
Oh, Holy Lord!

27:57.561 --> 27:59.321
I am your servant!

28:00.561 --> 28:02.041
I have a vision!

28:03.521 --> 28:06.600
Well, then, God is calling me as
well, because I can see it too.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.720
Oh, it's a sign!

28:08.721 --> 28:11.121
It's a sign the York reign
is ending.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.600
The sun in splendour
is being put out

28:15.601 --> 28:18.361
and the new king will come
like a dragon.

28:28.201 --> 28:29.841
My son must sail!

28:30.881 --> 28:33.041
His time is come!

28:37.881 --> 28:41.200
Anne, did you see the sun?

28:41.201 --> 28:44.240
How strange it was!

28:44.241 --> 28:46.481
My sister is here?

28:48.361 --> 28:50.680
And my son, Edward?

28:50.681 --> 28:52.721
Anne?

29:02.121 --> 29:03.881
My Lady Anne?

29:13.961 --> 29:16.280
Oh!

29:16.281 --> 29:18.561
Oh, God!

29:28.041 --> 29:30.640
Richard?

29:30.641 --> 29:32.721
She wasn't supposed to die.

29:34.601 --> 29:38.001
Not now. Not yet.

29:40.241 --> 29:42.801
Maybe it was a broken heart
because of me.

29:44.441 --> 29:46.920
Richard, you mustn't.

29:46.921 --> 29:49.961
I cannot talk to you, Elizabeth.

29:52.441 --> 29:55.201
They are saying I killed her
so I could marry you.

29:57.281 --> 29:58.961
But it isn't true!

30:02.121 --> 30:04.361
They are saying I poisoned her.

30:08.321 --> 30:11.800
The northern lords are all
for joining Tudor.

30:11.801 --> 30:16.400
As his ships... are loading in
Harfleur,

30:16.401 --> 30:19.721
bringing an army against me.

30:24.401 --> 30:26.201
You have to go, Elizabeth.

30:27.681 --> 30:30.241
No, Richard. Please!
I am not Richard!

30:31.801 --> 30:33.881
I am your King!

30:39.641 --> 30:41.481
Now go.

30:44.081 --> 30:46.081
Go!

30:55.921 --> 30:58.960
'So Richard sends
the witch's girl to us.'

30:58.961 --> 31:03.360
He's hoping to prove his
indifference to her. He thinks that
if her mother-in-law-to-be

31:03.361 --> 31:07.040
will give her house room, it will
show the world that she is chaste,

31:07.041 --> 31:13.320
and not, as we all thought,
bedding him as his wife was dying.

31:13.321 --> 31:16.280
He uses her then spits her out.

31:16.281 --> 31:18.760
Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that.

31:18.761 --> 31:23.600
He's on the march and... if Richard
defeats your son,

31:23.601 --> 31:26.400
he may still make her queen.

31:26.401 --> 31:29.000
This battle will decide
all our futures.

31:29.001 --> 31:31.040
So don't bully her, Margaret.

31:31.041 --> 31:33.200
I do not bully.

31:33.201 --> 31:37.281
I will merely help her
to move closer to our Lord.

31:51.481 --> 31:53.440
The wind has changed.

31:53.441 --> 31:55.001
He's sailing.

31:56.921 --> 32:00.160
But Lizzie is at his mother's house.

32:00.161 --> 32:02.600
And if Henry Tudor wins
and Lizzie marries him,

32:02.601 --> 32:03.961
her sons will die, won't they?

32:05.201 --> 32:08.081
Because you cursed the line
of whoever killed my brother.

32:27.361 --> 32:31.280
I won't intrude on you for very
long, Lady Margaret, but the King...

32:31.281 --> 32:33.041
We do not speak in God's house.

32:34.041 --> 32:35.680
And you will pray five times a day

32:35.681 --> 32:38.400
that my son forgives you
for your sin.

32:38.401 --> 32:40.561
And that God will make you
worthy of his hand.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.001
Oh, Lord.

32:55.561 --> 32:57.441
Favour me on this cause.

33:24.521 --> 33:27.441
I thought in Wales they'd flock to
join the Tudor standard.

33:28.801 --> 33:30.041
Where are the men?

33:43.921 --> 33:48.241
Ah, you're mustering your troops,
Margaret. I have to do the same.

33:49.481 --> 33:51.760
Richard's ordered every man
to turn out for his cause

33:51.761 --> 33:53.320
with penalties for those who fail.

33:53.321 --> 33:54.961
Have you picked a side?

33:57.881 --> 33:59.880
You may believe
I sold you to King Richard,

33:59.881 --> 34:03.760
but this morning my stepson
is one heartbeat from the throne.

34:03.761 --> 34:06.760
And it is my army that will decide
the outcome of this battle.

34:06.761 --> 34:09.041
Are you or are you not for Henry?

34:34.561 --> 34:36.000
Brackenbury?

34:36.001 --> 34:39.960
The Tudor army has landed
and what a motley band of convicts.

34:41.041 --> 34:44.280
How many?
Less than half your numbers.

34:44.281 --> 34:47.321
And Wales is not declaring for him.

34:51.801 --> 34:54.241
But we do not have Lord Stanley yet.

34:57.481 --> 35:02.720
Send a man to take Princess
Elizabeth from Lady Stanley's care.

35:02.721 --> 35:06.801
Command her husband to me
with his army now.

35:08.161 --> 35:10.481
Him and his brother.

35:30.841 --> 35:32.641
I saw the Royal Guards outside.

35:35.361 --> 35:36.920
Is it word from Richard?

35:36.921 --> 35:40.800
He's using you, you fool, to shame
Henry and rob men from his side.

35:40.801 --> 35:42.760
But you're so vain
you think he loves you.

35:42.761 --> 35:45.760
He does love me, you spiteful...

35:45.761 --> 35:48.600
You're a whore.

35:48.601 --> 35:52.041
You are monstrous in the eyes of God
for what you've done with him.

35:54.481 --> 35:59.880
You are the monster
for murdering my poor brother!

35:59.881 --> 36:02.281
You know nothing!

36:07.241 --> 36:09.201
My son will never marry you.

36:14.401 --> 36:17.240
Yes, he will.

36:17.241 --> 36:19.321
If he wins.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.960
Because that's the only way
he'd have

36:22.961 --> 36:25.801
the support of England
for his backside on the throne!

36:28.281 --> 36:35.920
So whatever happens in this battle,
I will be Queen,

36:35.921 --> 36:40.601
and this is the very last time that
you will ever sit in my presence.

37:04.801 --> 37:09.681
Lord Stanley writes that he is ill,
so he cannot meet for battle.

37:10.801 --> 37:12.120
Upon my honour, Your Grace.

37:12.121 --> 37:14.801
It is your father's honour
which is the issue here.

37:18.601 --> 37:21.040
Has he gone to Henry Tudor?

37:21.041 --> 37:22.520
I...

37:22.521 --> 37:26.201
No! My father is
true to you, Your Grace.

37:28.401 --> 37:30.160
Write to your father.

37:30.161 --> 37:35.040
Tell him if he does not meet us
on the road with his

37:35.041 --> 37:38.920
and his brother's full armies
tomorrow,

37:38.921 --> 37:40.081
you will die.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.801
If Stanley sides with Richard,
we'll be slaughtered.

38:07.161 --> 38:09.160
Even if he sits it out,
we'll be outnumbered.

38:09.161 --> 38:12.760
You must have faith, Henry.

38:12.761 --> 38:14.121
He will come.

38:17.281 --> 38:19.840
'Dear Mother, I have bad news.

38:19.841 --> 38:22.880
'Wales has not turned out for us
and now we hear Richard has

38:22.881 --> 38:26.201
'Lord Stanley's son held hostage to
make sure he joins him.

38:27.481 --> 38:31.760
'Mother, I can't lie to you,
we will lose without Lord Stanley

38:31.761 --> 38:34.601
'and I beg you to persuade him
to declare for us.

38:37.961 --> 38:41.000
'Please, God,
I'll see you at my coronation,

38:41.001 --> 38:42.761
'or else I shall never
see you again.'

39:04.201 --> 39:06.481
Where is he? My Lady.

39:23.481 --> 39:25.800
Henry's due...

39:25.801 --> 39:27.281
Husband...

39:28.601 --> 39:29.761
My Lady.

39:33.801 --> 39:38.441
I have heard about your son, but
Jasper and my boy have need of you.

39:39.761 --> 39:42.560
Well, then you will know that I
cannot join Henry until the battle,

39:42.561 --> 39:43.880
or my son will die.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.400
But one of you could join
them, surely?

39:46.401 --> 39:49.081
Isn't that what you do?
One brother on each side?

39:55.601 --> 39:57.001
Lady Margaret.

39:59.801 --> 40:03.800
If you don't declare for Henry
before the battle, he'll lose.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.800
He has not the men he hoped for.

40:05.801 --> 40:08.200
And those he has,
they'll just desert him

40:08.201 --> 40:10.961
once they know that he's
outnumbered. He'll be killed.

40:13.081 --> 40:16.200
You're asking me to
choose between your son and my own.

40:16.201 --> 40:19.360
Henry would ensure that
you are rewarded when he is King.

40:19.361 --> 40:20.480
And your son...

40:20.481 --> 40:23.040
Your son would be honoured
as a man of courage,

40:23.041 --> 40:25.161
the first to fall in
Henry's service.

40:28.961 --> 40:30.881
Please, Stanley, it...

40:32.201 --> 40:35.281
It is the will of God
that my son should be King.

40:36.441 --> 40:39.880
Well then God may crown him
without my help.

40:39.881 --> 40:42.001
I cannot put your son before mine.

41:24.721 --> 41:27.041
I thought I'd never see you again.

41:32.241 --> 41:34.441
I've come to make Stanley
declare for us.

41:35.921 --> 41:37.241
Have you spoken to him?

41:41.201 --> 41:43.521
He will not join you, Jasper.

41:46.441 --> 41:49.201
He and his brother will both
wait for the battle.

41:53.361 --> 41:55.400
I'm sorry.

41:55.401 --> 41:58.920
I have led you both to this
and now I cannot save you.

41:58.921 --> 42:01.041
Margaret, hush... It's all my fault!

42:03.801 --> 42:06.041
I thought I had a calling.

42:09.121 --> 42:14.520
I... I thought Henry had
a destiny to be King,

42:14.521 --> 42:18.120
and now you will both die
in a field because of me.

42:18.121 --> 42:21.360
Margaret, please, you must not say
that. You have to go. You have to go.

42:21.361 --> 42:24.000
You have to run away, please.
Just go!

42:24.001 --> 42:25.840
Just take my son and run. Just flee.

42:25.841 --> 42:28.121
I've been running all my life,
Margaret.

42:30.441 --> 42:31.721
And so has Henry.

42:34.481 --> 42:37.481
This time we will stand our ground
and fight.

42:39.401 --> 42:42.361
No matter what fate should deal us.

42:58.201 --> 42:59.681
Let me see him?

43:12.161 --> 43:13.961
All right.

44:06.321 --> 44:07.841
Henry?

44:13.761 --> 44:16.040
Mother?

44:16.041 --> 44:19.041
Am... Am I dreaming?
Are you really here?

44:21.041 --> 44:22.521
I'm here.

44:25.361 --> 44:27.681
I'm here, my love. I'm here.

44:33.641 --> 44:35.401
And is God here?

44:40.201 --> 44:41.841
If He is with me...

44:43.761 --> 44:45.321
I know that I will win.

44:48.721 --> 44:53.121
God is with you. You cannot fail.

44:55.921 --> 44:58.321
The will of God
has always been for you.

45:13.641 --> 45:16.561
I want all this out of here, right.
As fast as you can.

45:18.161 --> 45:20.160
Come on, lad. We need
all this out of the way.

45:20.161 --> 45:24.121
I want you to take it out there and
by there, all right? Fast as you
can, the sun's coming up.

45:32.041 --> 45:33.401
Henry?

45:36.041 --> 45:38.401
Like a Tudor, eh?

45:40.761 --> 45:42.241
Like a Tudor, uncle.

45:48.441 --> 45:50.961
Come on. The sun's coming up.
Come on.

46:15.921 --> 46:18.081
They're even more of
a shambles in the dawn light.

46:19.561 --> 46:21.600
No word from Stanley?

46:21.601 --> 46:23.241
He says he's on his way but...

46:27.041 --> 46:29.041
You will not even need him.

46:34.081 --> 46:35.281
Your Grace.

46:43.081 --> 46:45.161
You're riding into battle
in your crown?

46:46.801 --> 46:50.641
If Tudor wants to take me on,
then he won't have to search for me.

48:31.201 --> 48:32.641
Give the word.

48:40.601 --> 48:42.161
To arms!

48:49.681 --> 48:51.520
Charge!

48:51.521 --> 48:53.081
Charge!

49:47.001 --> 49:48.640
Richard?

49:48.641 --> 49:51.921
Oh, my boy. My boy.

49:56.721 --> 49:59.800
Is it true that my brother,
Prince Edward, is dead?

49:59.801 --> 50:01.400
I'm afraid it is.

50:01.401 --> 50:04.720
When I am grown, I will avenge him.

50:04.721 --> 50:06.521
It is already done, Richard.

50:09.281 --> 50:11.641
Vengeance brings only more
vengeance...

50:14.081 --> 50:16.921
and battle brings death.

50:52.561 --> 50:55.441
You do know my father
will decide this battle?

52:15.721 --> 52:19.120
York! York, to me!

52:19.121 --> 52:22.080
York and England!

52:22.081 --> 52:23.761
England!

52:26.201 --> 52:28.281
England!

52:40.001 --> 52:42.681
Go, Henry! Get to safety!

52:44.921 --> 52:47.000
Come on!

52:47.001 --> 52:49.600
Retreat!

52:49.601 --> 52:51.440
Come on!

52:51.441 --> 52:52.880
Retreat!

52:52.881 --> 52:56.561
Damn Stanley!
Why does he not declare for me?

53:11.481 --> 53:14.121
Charge!

53:16.881 --> 53:19.960
But whose side?

53:19.961 --> 53:21.481
Whose side?!

54:15.961 --> 54:18.921
For Tudor! For Tudor!

54:20.961 --> 54:22.680
For Tudor!

54:22.681 --> 54:23.961
Treason!

54:27.841 --> 54:29.400
For Tudor!

54:29.401 --> 54:32.000
For Tudor!

54:32.001 --> 54:34.200
Get the King a horse!

54:34.201 --> 54:35.721
Get the King a horse!

56:31.841 --> 56:33.241
God save the King.

56:39.761 --> 56:41.200
God save the King.

56:41.201 --> 56:42.680
God save the King.

56:42.681 --> 56:44.960
God save the King!
God save the King!

56:44.961 --> 56:47.161
God save the King!

57:22.001 --> 57:24.281
I promised you this day would come.

57:25.721 --> 57:27.880
You may stay down on your knees.

57:27.881 --> 57:32.641
I am the King's mother and you
shall kneel to me as to a queen.

57:38.281 --> 57:40.001
I am Margaret Regina.

57:56.801 --> 57:57.921
Elizabeth?

58:00.041 --> 58:01.401
Mother, I'm afraid.

58:04.401 --> 58:09.201
You must be strong.
You will marry Henry Tudor.

58:16.041 --> 58:17.921
And you will be Queen of England.

58:19.801 --> 58:21.681
As I once was.

58:27.961 --> 59:01.078
