00:35.101 --> 00:36.267
THAT WAS SWEET.
YEAH.

00:36.335 --> 00:37.686
WHY DON'T YOU GO
PUT ON A SKIRT,

00:37.753 --> 00:39.570
'CAUSE YOU ARE MY BITCH.

00:39.638 --> 00:41.706
I JUST BEAT YOU
3 STRAIGHT GAMES.

00:41.774 --> 00:43.608
YOU MIGHT'VE WON
3 GAMES,

00:43.675 --> 00:45.576
BUT, UH, I HAD
MORE TOTAL POINTS.

00:45.644 --> 00:48.279
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

00:48.347 --> 00:50.849
YOU LOST.
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

00:55.637 --> 00:58.323
SWEET MARY.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.292
SHOULD I WAIT FOR YOU,
SHOULD I GO HOME?

01:01.360 --> 01:02.293
WHAT?

01:02.361 --> 01:03.694
WH-WHAT'S THE DEAL?

01:03.763 --> 01:05.245
OH, IT'S
A POLE-DANCING CLASS.

01:05.313 --> 01:06.865
THEY GOT THEM
ALL OVER THE PLACE NOW.

01:06.932 --> 01:08.332
WOW.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.385
GLAD I WORE
MY BAGGY SHORTS.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.595
SOME WILD STUFF, HUH?

01:20.663 --> 01:22.464
SEE THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE?

01:22.531 --> 01:23.231
THAT'S MY WIFE.

01:23.298 --> 01:25.750
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S LIMBER.

01:25.818 --> 01:27.335
YEAH. SHE'S BEEN DOING IT
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

01:27.403 --> 01:28.703
IT'S A GREAT WORKOUT.

01:28.771 --> 01:30.304
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU.

01:30.373 --> 01:32.607
IT'S BEEN A NICE ADDITION TO THE
BEDROOM, KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

01:32.675 --> 01:33.458
WHAT?

01:33.526 --> 01:35.443
YOU-

01:35.511 --> 01:37.512
YOUR WIFE POLE-DANCES
FOR YOU IN YOUR HOME,

01:37.580 --> 01:38.813
IN YOUR BEDROOM?

01:38.880 --> 01:40.648
YEAH.

01:42.718 --> 01:45.220
DEAC, HIS WIFE POLE-DANCES
FOR HIM IN HIS BEDROOM.

01:45.287 --> 01:46.554
DID YOU KNOW
THAT KIND OF THING

01:46.622 --> 01:47.822
WAS GOING ON
IN THE WORLD?

01:47.889 --> 01:48.807
UH-HUH.

01:48.874 --> 01:50.608
WHY, YOU THINK YOU WANT
CARRIE TO DO THAT FOR YOU?

01:50.676 --> 01:54.362
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING I
WANT HIS WIFE TO DO IT FOR ME.

01:55.764 --> 01:58.666
BUT CARRIE WOULD
BE GOOD, TOO.

01:58.734 --> 02:00.352
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
SUGGEST IT TO HER?

02:00.419 --> 02:01.118
I CAN'T DO THAT.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.570
IF SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO DRESS UP AS BATGIRL,

02:02.638 --> 02:04.472
SHE AIN'T GONNA WANT
TO DO THIS.

02:04.539 --> 02:06.641
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE A LOT OF FUN.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.326
SHE MIGHT GO FOR IT.

02:08.394 --> 02:10.762
WHY, YOU THINK YOU COULD
BRING THIS THING UP TO KELLY?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.530
I GUESS SO.
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME.

02:12.598 --> 02:15.233
WE GOT PLENTY GOING ON
IN THE BEDROOM AS IT IS.

02:17.403 --> 02:20.822
EVER GET TIRED OF BEING
A RACIAL STEREOTYPE?

02:23.225 --> 02:24.643
NO.

02:26.412 --> 02:27.579
DO YOU?

02:31.083 --> 02:33.752
AND THEN I GOT THE DRAGON
IN ATLANTIC CITY

02:33.819 --> 02:35.520
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.155
IT'S NICE.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.758
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S PRETTY
MAD AT YOSEMITE SAM.

02:39.825 --> 02:42.026
WHAT ABOUT YOU, CARRIE,
YOU HAVE ANY TATS?

02:42.094 --> 02:43.194
TATTOOS? NO.

02:43.262 --> 02:46.664
I HAVE A JOB, SO...

02:46.732 --> 02:50.669
HEY, IT'S REALLY GREAT
YOU GUYS HAD US OVER LIKE THIS.

02:50.736 --> 02:54.138
I'M GLAD YOU CHASED US DOWN
IN THE PARKING LOT, DOUG.

02:54.206 --> 02:56.591
I JUST HAD AN INSTINCT,
YOU KNOW?

02:56.659 --> 02:58.058
WHAT ELSE YOU GUYS INTO?

02:58.126 --> 03:01.061
I KNOW YOU WORK OUT 'CAUSE I
MET YOU AT THE GYM. I MEAN...

03:01.129 --> 03:03.381
YEAH, I DO WEIGHTS,
LIKE, 4 OR 5 TIMES A WEEK-

03:03.449 --> 03:04.448
EXCELLENT!

03:04.516 --> 03:07.051
HOW ABOUT YOU ANNA MARIA?
WHAT DO YOU DO THERE?

03:07.119 --> 03:08.252
UM, TREADMILL.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.654
OH. AND?

03:09.722 --> 03:10.738
STAIRMASTER SOMETIMES.

03:10.806 --> 03:12.373
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT MORE-

03:12.440 --> 03:15.126
ANYTHING ELSE?
ANYTHING ELSE YOU DO THERE?

03:15.194 --> 03:17.879
WELL, I'VE BEEN TAKING
THAT POLE-DANCING CLASS.

03:17.946 --> 03:19.613
THAT'S CRAZY.
POLE-DANCING.

03:19.681 --> 03:20.581
CRAZY WHAT THESE CHICKS
ARE INTO NOWADAYS.

03:20.649 --> 03:22.050
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, ED.

03:22.117 --> 03:24.168
WHY DON'T WE LET THE LADIES
TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE.

03:24.236 --> 03:25.804
WE'LL GO GET ANOTHER
BEER IN THE KITCHEN?

03:25.871 --> 03:26.805
OK.

03:26.872 --> 03:28.306
I ALSO TAKE SPINNING
ON TUESDAYS.

03:28.373 --> 03:30.341
THEY JUST GOT
SOME NEW EQUIP-

03:30.409 --> 03:33.177
POLE-DANCING!

03:33.245 --> 03:34.145
BYE, THANK YOU.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.847
BYE, GUYS. SEE YA.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.183
HUH? OUR NEW
GO-TO COUPLE.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.217
MM-HMM.

03:39.284 --> 03:41.319
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.453
WHAT?

03:42.521 --> 03:43.304
DID YOU ACTUALLY THINK
YOU CAN TRICK ME

03:43.455 --> 03:45.924
INTO TAKING
A POLE-DANCING-DUH-

03:45.991 --> 03:47.591
DAT GIRL POLE-DANCES.

03:47.659 --> 03:51.129
ME WANNA POLE-DANCE, TOO.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.813
I WASN'T TRYING
TO TRICK YOU.

03:52.881 --> 03:54.482
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
A WAY TO SUGGEST IT.

03:54.550 --> 03:57.285
I FIGURED IF I BROUGHT IT
UP MYSELF, YOU'D GET MAD.

03:57.353 --> 03:58.403
YEAH. I'M MAD NOW.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.639
MAD 'CAUSE I HAD TO
MAKE STEAK FOR IDIOTS.

04:00.706 --> 04:02.607
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
AN OPEN MIND?

04:02.675 --> 04:04.308
A LOT OF WOMEN
ARE POLE-DANCING NOWADAYS.

04:04.376 --> 04:05.877
IT'S A WHOLE THING,
AND WE'RE MISSING IT.

04:05.945 --> 04:06.894
<i>NO. I'M
NOT MISSING IT.</i>

04:06.962 --> 04:08.162
<i>YOU'RE MISSING IT.</i>

04:08.230 --> 04:11.349
I'M OK NOT GYRATING AROUND
LIKE A 2-DOLLAR WHORE.

04:11.416 --> 04:12.250
TRY IT ONCE.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.068
OHH.

04:13.135 --> 04:14.653
COME ON!

04:14.720 --> 04:17.755
DOUG, I AM NOT POLE-DANCING
FOR YOU IN OUR BEDROOM.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.492
THIS IS SO TYPICAL
OF YOU, TOO.

04:20.559 --> 04:22.093
AS SOON AS THE LIGHTS GO OUT UPSTAIRS,

04:22.161 --> 04:23.627
YOU'RE ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR YOURSELF.

04:23.695 --> 04:25.497
THIS WOULDN'T BE JUST FOR ME.
IT WOULD BE FOR US.

04:25.564 --> 04:27.698
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING HERE. OK?

04:27.766 --> 04:28.933
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

04:29.001 --> 04:30.735
JUST SOME FREE INFORMATION

04:30.802 --> 04:32.103
I GOT AT THE
POLE-DANCING CLASS.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.306
OK, LOOK. ALL THESE WOMEN
TALK ABOUT HOW AT FIRST

04:35.374 --> 04:37.208
THEY WERE SKEPTICAL,
BUT AFTER THEY TRIED IT,

04:37.276 --> 04:39.860
THEY FELT MORE SEXUAL,
MORE EMPOWERED.

04:39.928 --> 04:42.647
HERE, LOOK AT THE SPANISH LADY
HOLDING THE BRIEFCASE.

04:42.714 --> 04:45.983
YO SOY "EMPOWERMENTE."

04:47.853 --> 04:49.019
NOT INTERESTED.

04:49.087 --> 04:51.289
AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK
AT THE VIDEO.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.706
THEY GAVE YOU A VIDEO?

04:52.774 --> 04:55.476
THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME.
IT WAS 29.95.

04:55.543 --> 04:57.511
YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?
YOUR POLE-DANCING FANTASY

04:57.579 --> 05:00.014
IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN, OK?
SO JUST GIVE IT UP.

05:02.634 --> 05:05.119
WELL, WE'RE ALREADY
ON THE MAILING LIST.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.720
WHAT THE HELL IS
KATIE COURIC UP TO NOW?

05:56.788 --> 05:57.788
HEY, DAD.

05:57.856 --> 05:59.557
DIDN'T HEAR YOU
BACK THERE.

05:59.624 --> 06:03.360
OH, IT'S A TAPE.
WHAT IS IT?

06:03.428 --> 06:07.281
UH, JUST AN INSTRUCTIONAL
VIDEO FROM A CLASS I MAY TAKE.

06:07.349 --> 06:08.683
WELL, I'M LATE FOR WORK.

06:08.750 --> 06:09.801
LOVE YA. BYE-BYE.

06:14.106 --> 06:18.776
"POLE CATS. THE EROTIC
ART OF POLE-DANCING."

06:19.878 --> 06:21.746
OH, DEAR GOD.

06:25.951 --> 06:27.452
COME ON.
WHEN'S IT GETTING HERE?

06:27.519 --> 06:29.153
SIT DOWN, WILL YA?
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW

06:29.221 --> 06:31.589
IS NOT GONNA MAKE THE
POLE GET HERE ANY FASTER.

06:31.657 --> 06:32.990
IT'S ALMOST 5:00.

06:33.058 --> 06:35.693
EXPRESS MAIL GUARANTEED
DELIVERY BEFORE 5:00.

06:35.761 --> 06:37.912
EXPRESS MAIL?
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE US?

06:37.980 --> 06:39.214
US? WE SUCK.

06:40.816 --> 06:42.433
I CAN'T BELIEVE
CARRIE WENT FOR IT.

06:42.501 --> 06:45.103
SHE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THE PLEASING YOU TYPE.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.071
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO DO IT AT FIRST,

06:47.139 --> 06:49.440
BUT AFTER SHE TRIED IT FOR A COUPLE
OF WEEKS, SHE REALLY LOVES IT.

06:49.508 --> 06:52.376
SHE SAYS IT GETS HER IN TOUCH
WITH HER INNER WHORE. IT'S NICE.

06:53.812 --> 06:55.980
AND THE RICH GET RICHER.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.482
OH, MAN, I WANT
THIS THING TO COME QUICK.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.584
YOU KNOW, I AM READY
FOR MY FIRST DANCE.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.919
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING? READY.

07:01.987 --> 07:02.954
UH-HUH.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.505
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.740
LOOK WHAT SHE MADE
FOR ME. COUPONS.

07:08.327 --> 07:13.198
"GOOD FOR ONE FREE POLE
DANCE FROM MISTY HEFFERNAN."

07:13.265 --> 07:17.969
DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE AN AUNT
NAMED MISTY HEFFERNAN?

07:18.037 --> 07:20.087
YEAH. SHE JUST HAD
HIP SURGERY.

07:20.155 --> 07:22.056
GOOD LADY.

07:22.124 --> 07:25.776
GUESS WHO'S HERE.
THE POLE FAIRY.

07:25.844 --> 07:28.512
SOMEONE JUST BOUGHT HIMSELF
A NEW NICKNAME.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.381
COME ON, GUYS,
GIVE ME A HAND.

07:33.368 --> 07:34.935
HEY, ARTHUR.
I'M GONNA MAKE A SANDWICH.

07:35.003 --> 07:35.736
YOU WANT ONE?

07:35.804 --> 07:37.321
NOPE.
YOU SURE?

07:37.389 --> 07:39.924
A MAN WHO TURNS HIS OWN
DAUGHTER INTO AN EXOTIC DANCER

07:39.992 --> 07:42.560
DOES NOT DESERVE TO EAT.

07:42.627 --> 07:45.196
THEY'VE GOT FRESH
CORNED BEEF.

07:45.264 --> 07:46.364
NO!

07:48.917 --> 07:51.002
WELL, THERE IT GOES.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.354
A 10-FOOT ARROW
THROUGH MY HEART.

07:56.124 --> 07:58.692
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

07:58.760 --> 07:59.844
DAMN IT, MAN,
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:59.912 --> 08:02.313
WHEN A CHILD DOESN'T GET
ENOUGH LOVE AND AFFECTION

08:02.380 --> 08:03.564
FROM HER OWN FATHER,

08:03.632 --> 08:05.699
SHE SEEKS IT
FROM STRANGE MEN.

08:05.768 --> 08:07.401
THAT'S WHY CARRIE'S
DOING THIS.

08:07.469 --> 08:09.203
BECAUSE I SPENT
HER CHILDHOOD

08:09.271 --> 08:12.039
CHASING AFTER
THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR.

08:12.107 --> 08:13.307
HOW'D THAT WORK OUT
FOR YOU?

08:15.227 --> 08:17.145
LOOK, ARTHUR, YOU'RE GETTING
WORKED UP OVER NOTHING.

08:17.212 --> 08:19.013
SHE'S JUST GONNA
DANCE FOR DOUG.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.330
OH, SURE, THAT'S
HOW IT STARTS.

08:20.398 --> 08:23.467
THEN IT'S PEEP SHOWS,
STRIP JOINTS,

08:23.535 --> 08:26.370
AND BEFORE LONG, SHE'S AT THE
PORT AUTHORITY IN HOT PANTS,

08:26.438 --> 08:30.908
BECKONING DRUNKEN MARINES INTO
THE BACK OF AN ABANDONED BUS.

08:30.976 --> 08:31.876
WHAT'S THAT?

08:32.027 --> 08:33.094
PUMPERNICKEL?

08:33.160 --> 08:35.395
CUT ME OFF HALF.

08:39.484 --> 08:41.284
DOUG.

08:41.352 --> 08:42.554
YEAH?

08:42.621 --> 08:45.339
MISTY IS READY.

08:47.826 --> 08:50.327
DON'T
FORGET THE COUPON.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.571
M- MISTY?

09:00.639 --> 09:02.640
I'M IN THE BATHROOM.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.643
TURN ON THE MUSIC AND
SETTLE IN, BIG BOY.

09:07.045 --> 09:08.445
YEAH.

09:10.849 --> 09:13.584
<i>THE PELICAN BRIEF,
BY JOHN GRISHAM.</i>

09:13.652 --> 09:16.754
THE CD!
NOT THE TAPE!

10:35.200 --> 10:36.633
HEY. SO...

10:36.702 --> 10:37.968
HOW WAS
OPENING NIGHT?

10:38.036 --> 10:40.705
OH. THE POLE-DANCING.

10:40.772 --> 10:42.339
IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS GOOD.

10:42.407 --> 10:43.507
ALL RIGHT.

10:43.575 --> 10:44.808
SO, YOU...

10:44.876 --> 10:46.244
IT WAS HOT?

10:46.311 --> 10:46.994
SIZZLIN'.

10:47.061 --> 10:48.412
OHH.

10:48.479 --> 10:49.580
SHE, UH...

10:49.647 --> 10:51.849
SHE REALLY...

10:51.917 --> 10:53.317
REALLY...

10:53.385 --> 10:56.087
SHOULDN'T BE POLE-DANCING.

10:56.154 --> 10:58.822
OH, REALLY?
THAT'S TOO BAD.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.291
NO GOOD?

11:00.359 --> 11:02.777
NO.

11:02.844 --> 11:04.078
AWW.

11:04.146 --> 11:06.313
SHE TRIED,
GOD BLESS HER.

11:06.381 --> 11:08.882
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SHE WAS
DOING EVERYTHING THEY TAUGHT HER

11:08.950 --> 11:10.251
AND GOING THROUGH
THE MOVES.

11:10.318 --> 11:13.687
I DEFINITELY GOT A SENSE OF
WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

11:13.755 --> 11:16.557
MAKES YOU REALLY
APPRECIATE THE PROS, HUH?

11:16.625 --> 11:18.276
OH, YOU SAID IT, BROTHER.

11:18.343 --> 11:19.026
ALL RIGHT,
SO IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

11:19.094 --> 11:20.578
JUST GET RID OF THE POLE
AND MOVE ON.

11:20.645 --> 11:22.246
I CAN'T. I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT HER INTO IT,

11:22.314 --> 11:23.514
AND NOW SHE'S HOOKED.

11:23.582 --> 11:26.017
SHE'S THINKING OF MAKING
IT AN EVERY-NIGHT THING,

11:26.085 --> 11:28.485
AND SHE'S EVEN TALKING
ABOUT PUTTING IN A SPOTLIGHT.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.324
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
DEAC,

11:33.391 --> 11:35.226
YOU WERE SMART FOR NOT
GETTING KELLY INVOLVED.

11:35.293 --> 11:37.962
UH, YEAH. AHEM.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.599
WHAT?

11:41.666 --> 11:42.550
IT'S JUST...

11:42.618 --> 11:44.785
AFTER THAT DAY AT THE GYM,
I ACTUALLY DID

11:44.853 --> 11:48.372
KIND OF SUGGEST IT TO KELLY, AND
SHE'S BEEN DOING IT SINCE THEN.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.306
REALLY?

11:49.374 --> 11:50.941
HOW IS SHE?

11:51.009 --> 11:52.543
SHE'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

11:56.047 --> 11:57.565
GOOD MORNING.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.001
HEY.
HONEY.

12:02.203 --> 12:03.704
SO LAST NIGHT WAS...

12:03.772 --> 12:04.955
OK?

12:05.023 --> 12:07.091
YEAH. MM-HMM.
YEAH. UH-HUH.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.492
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:08.559 --> 12:11.395
<i>YO SOY "EMPOWERMENTE."</i>

12:15.267 --> 12:17.701
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
BEFORE I FORGET,

12:17.769 --> 12:20.004
I GOT ANOTHER COUPON
FOR YOU.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.339
OH, THAT'S OK.
I REALLY HAVE SOME-

12:21.406 --> 12:23.740
TAKE IT. OK, OK, YEAH,
YEAH. I'LL TAKE IT.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.617
OK, UH,
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

12:33.685 --> 12:35.019
DEAC, COME ON. YEAH, YEAH. BYE, CARRIE.

12:35.086 --> 12:36.520
ALL RIGHT,
BYE, YOU GUYS.

12:36.588 --> 12:38.189
BYE, DEAC.
SEE YOU LATER.

12:40.325 --> 12:42.626
DARLING, I REALIZE
I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVING YOU

12:42.694 --> 12:44.795
THE TIME AND ATTENTION
YOU DESERVE.

12:44.863 --> 12:46.497
ARE YOU FREE
THIS SATURDAY AFTERNOON?

12:46.564 --> 12:48.866
UM
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST SAY YES!

12:50.035 --> 12:51.668
YES.

12:51.736 --> 12:53.454
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

12:53.521 --> 12:55.155
DADDY'S HERE.

14:04.876 --> 14:08.545
MAKE IT STOP!

14:13.134 --> 14:14.485
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

14:14.553 --> 14:15.819
YOUR SHIFT WAS OVER
4 HOURS AGO.

14:15.887 --> 14:18.389
YEAH, I KNOW. JUST CLEANING
OUT THE OLD LOCKER. HEH.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.573
YOU KNOW MY MOTTO.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.209
A MESSY LOCKER'S
THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND.

14:22.277 --> 14:25.095
I THOUGHT YOUR MOTTO WAS
"EAT THROUGH THE PAIN."

14:25.163 --> 14:26.997
GUY CAN'T HAVE
2 MOTTOES?

14:27.065 --> 14:28.465
LISTEN TO ME, PLAYER.

14:30.785 --> 14:32.786
GO HOME.

14:32.854 --> 14:34.472
I CAN'T.

14:34.539 --> 14:38.309
SHE'S THERE LIMBERING UP AS WE SPEAK.

14:38.376 --> 14:39.843
I CAN'T SIT
IN THAT CHAIR AGAIN.

14:39.911 --> 14:41.711
YOU CAN'T LIVE
LIKE THIS, MAN.

14:41.779 --> 14:43.013
DEAC, SHE GAVE ME
MORE COUPONS.

14:43.081 --> 14:45.749
50, DAMN IT!
50 COUPONS!

14:45.817 --> 14:48.685
I USED TO-I USED TO
LOVE POLE-DANCING.

14:48.753 --> 14:50.354
I USED TO LOVE COUPONS.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.823
I GOT AN ARBY'S COUPON IN MY
WALLET FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.524
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT!

14:59.714 --> 15:01.214
IT'S TIME NOW.

15:03.451 --> 15:06.286
NOTHING'S WORKED, SPENCE.

15:06.354 --> 15:10.224
I'VE SHOWERED HER WITH FATHERLY
AFFECTION FOR 2 ENTIRE WEEKS,

15:10.291 --> 15:11.925
BUT STILL SHE GOES
BACK UP THERE EVERY NIGHT

15:11.993 --> 15:13.810
AND GETS HER FREAK ON
FOR FATTY.

15:16.597 --> 15:17.964
SO, WHERE DO YOU
WANNA GET DINNER?

15:18.033 --> 15:20.401
OH, CAN I TALK YOU
INTO ETHIOPIAN?

15:20.468 --> 15:23.037
NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR GAZELLE, THANK YOU.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.440
HEY, LOOK!

15:26.508 --> 15:28.275
THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.
WHAT?

15:28.342 --> 15:30.043
I'LL GET ONE OF THE STRIPPERS
TO COME HOME

15:30.111 --> 15:32.946
AND TELL CARRIE WHAT LIFE
ON THE POLE IS REALLY LIKE,

15:33.014 --> 15:35.482
EVERY DEPRAVED
AND PATHETIC DETAIL.

15:35.550 --> 15:37.651
SHE'LL BE SCARED STRAIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:37.719 --> 15:39.420
SOUNDS PRETTY STUPID.

15:39.487 --> 15:40.821
COME ON.

15:42.857 --> 15:45.492
DOESN'T LOOK CLEAN
IN THERE.

15:55.370 --> 15:56.970
PLEASE BE ASLEEP.

16:02.110 --> 16:03.643
DOUG.

16:03.711 --> 16:06.213
YEAH.

16:06.281 --> 16:08.215
YOU'RE LAAATE.

16:08.283 --> 16:10.350
NOT LATE ENOUGH.

16:33.274 --> 16:36.877
WELCOME
TO THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM.

16:36.945 --> 16:38.762
COME IN.

16:47.622 --> 16:48.756
WHY'D YOU
TURN IT OFF?

16:48.823 --> 16:49.890
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT WE'D, UH,

16:49.958 --> 16:51.391
CHANGE IT UP
A LITTLE TONIGHT.

16:51.459 --> 16:53.744
OH, YEAH? OK, HOW ABOUT
SOME DIFFERENT MUSIC?

16:53.812 --> 16:56.146
<i>HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
HOT FOR TEACHER?</i>

16:56.214 --> 16:57.214
HEH HEH HEH.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.883
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. UH...

16:58.950 --> 17:01.518
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I'D DO SOMETHING FOR YOU, YOU KNOW.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.088
YOU WANT A MASSAGE?
HOW ABOUT A SEXY MASSAGE?

17:04.155 --> 17:06.257
OH. YEAH.
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

17:06.324 --> 17:06.990
ALL RIGHT.

17:07.142 --> 17:08.074
HEH HEH HEH.

17:08.143 --> 17:09.075
THERE WE GO.

17:09.144 --> 17:11.111
ALL RIGHT.

17:11.179 --> 17:12.712
MM-HMM.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.114
OH, THAT'S NICE.

17:14.182 --> 17:15.449
OH, IT IS, RIGHT?

17:15.517 --> 17:18.251
SO RELAXING I COULD
JUST FALL ASLEEP.

17:21.323 --> 17:23.589
JUST GO AHEAD THEN
THERE, MISTY.

17:23.657 --> 17:25.909
MM-MMM. MISTY DOESN'T
WANT TO SLEEP.

17:25.977 --> 17:28.945
SHE HAS A NEW DANCE
FOR HER MAN TONIGHT.

17:29.013 --> 17:31.648
THAT'S OK. SLEEP.

17:31.716 --> 17:32.883
SLEEP, MISTY.

17:32.951 --> 17:33.951
MM-MMM.

17:34.018 --> 17:35.903
FIRST, A DANCE.

17:35.971 --> 17:36.820
NO, YOU SLEEP. SLEEP.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.171
DOUG, GET OFF!

17:38.239 --> 17:39.907
OK.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.275
JUST THOUGHT MISTY
COULD USE A LITTLE SLEEP.

17:42.343 --> 17:45.379
I KNOW, BUT THERE'LL BE
ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT LATER.

18:10.238 --> 18:11.338
STOP IT!

18:11.406 --> 18:13.874
WHAT? WHY'D YOU TURN
THE MUSIC OFF, BABY?

18:13.942 --> 18:15.409
IT WAS EITHER THAT
OR DIVE OUT THE WINDOW.

18:15.476 --> 18:16.576
CARRIE...

18:16.644 --> 18:18.311
CARRIE,
YOU'RE HORRIBLE AT THIS.

18:19.281 --> 18:21.098
WHAT, YOU THINK I'M
HORRIBLE AT THIS?

18:21.165 --> 18:22.115
NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT HORRIBLE.

18:22.183 --> 18:24.235
THAT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR.
BUT YOU'RE...

18:24.302 --> 18:26.237
NO, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE HORRIBLE.

18:26.304 --> 18:28.772
WHAT, SO FOR
THE LAST 2 WEEKS,

18:28.840 --> 18:31.141
YOU'VE JUST BEEN
PRETENDING TO LIKE IT?

18:31.209 --> 18:33.259
KIND OF, YEAH.

18:33.327 --> 18:34.945
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.113
CARRIE, SO WHAT?

18:36.180 --> 18:38.315
THIS STUPID POLE THING
DIDN'T WORK OUT. WHO CARES?

18:38.383 --> 18:40.818
I STILL THINK YOU'RE THE
SEXIEST WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.553
I MEAN,
WE HAVE EACH OTHER,

18:42.621 --> 18:44.588
AND THAT'S THE ONLY
DAMN THING THAT MATTERS.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.173
OHH!

18:47.241 --> 18:49.293
YOU'RE AN ASS.

18:49.361 --> 18:51.978
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA IN THE
FIRST PLACE, YOU KNOW. I KNOW.

18:52.046 --> 18:53.246
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I SUCK AT IT?

18:53.314 --> 18:55.716
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
HOW HUMILIATING THIS IS?

18:55.783 --> 18:58.602
I KNOW. WE'VE BOTH GONE
THROUGH HELL THESE PAST 2 WEEKS.

18:58.703 --> 19:00.304
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?

19:00.371 --> 19:02.222
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

19:02.290 --> 19:04.958
BECAUSE MY INSTRUCTOR SAID I AM
VERY, VERY TALENTED AT THIS.

19:05.026 --> 19:06.193
YEAH. THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE PAYING HER.

19:06.261 --> 19:10.064
NO, NO. I'M DOING THE MOVES
EXACTLY LIKE SHE TAUGHT US.

19:10.131 --> 19:11.815
OK, YOU MIGHT BE DOING THEM
RIGHT TECHNICALLY, BUT YOU-

19:11.883 --> 19:12.883
YOU'RE JUST NOT...

19:12.950 --> 19:14.818
NOT WHAT?

19:14.886 --> 19:17.120
LOOK, YOU...

19:17.188 --> 19:19.689
YOU'RE NOT
FEELING IT, OK?

19:19.757 --> 19:21.758
YOU'RE NOT LIVING IT.

19:21.826 --> 19:23.727
LIKE THAT SPIN-KICK MOVE
YOU DO...

19:23.794 --> 19:24.595
YEAH.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.629
YOU...

19:25.780 --> 19:27.381
L- LET ME JUST SHOW YOU.

19:33.187 --> 19:37.157
YOU NEED TO BECOME ONE
WITH THE POLE, YOU KNOW?

19:37.224 --> 19:40.126
JUST FEEL IT. JUST
FEEL IT. JUST HAVE FUN.

19:40.194 --> 19:42.946
'CAUSE YOU GOTTA FEEL IT.
FEEL IT EVERY TIME.

19:43.014 --> 19:44.464
YOU GOTTA BECOME ONE-
AND JUST ENJOY IT.

19:44.532 --> 19:46.166
ENJOY WHO YOU ARE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

19:46.234 --> 19:47.234
UH-HUH.

19:57.929 --> 20:00.930
OH, AND THAT UPSIDE-DOWN MOVE
YOU DO WHEN YOU GET UP THERE,

20:00.998 --> 20:02.149
YOU'RE HERE.

20:02.217 --> 20:03.267
YOU GOTTA BE HERE
LIKE THIS.

20:03.335 --> 20:06.237
AND WHEN YOU SLIDE DOWN,

20:06.304 --> 20:07.605
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

20:07.672 --> 20:09.440
WHEN YOU'RE COMING DOWN,
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

20:09.507 --> 20:11.709
I'M AN ANGEL, OK?

20:14.595 --> 20:16.180
AND THIS-
AND THIS HERE.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.570
OK?

20:26.023 --> 20:27.891
JUST FEEL IT.

20:27.959 --> 20:28.942
LET IT-FEEL IT.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.410
WORK IT...

20:30.478 --> 20:32.212
AND BECOME IT.

20:46.728 --> 20:47.995
CARRIE.

20:48.062 --> 20:49.730
WE SHOULD PROBABLY SHUT
THE DOOR. YOUR FATHER.

20:49.797 --> 20:51.832
NO. MY DAD'S NOT HOME.

20:56.554 --> 20:58.221
I STILL HAVEN'T
HAD DINNER.

20:58.289 --> 21:00.490
SHUT UP
AND GET MORE SINGLES.

21:10.134 --> 21:12.502
NICE TO SPEND TIME
TOGETHER, HUH?

21:12.570 --> 21:14.237
I'M NOT GONNA STOP
POLE-DANCING, ARTHUR.

21:14.305 --> 21:16.540
FINE!
THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY!
