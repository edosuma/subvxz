WEBVTT

00:10.707 --> 00:12.374
Yeah, they definitely
feel pain with this guy.

00:12.476 --> 00:13.942
Come on.

00:14.044 --> 00:17.312
It came at me so fast,
and then, like, swoosh.

00:17.414 --> 00:20.215
There's times when she
really loses her [bleep]

00:20.350 --> 00:21.182
Someone probably shot him.

00:21.284 --> 00:23.702
Shot him twice. Killed him.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.955
Oh. Somebody dies.

00:27.057 --> 00:29.290
I tell my kids everything's fine.

00:29.393 --> 00:32.961
But I'm not sure if I'm
telling them the truth.

00:33.046 --> 00:34.529
They want to kill someone.

00:34.631 --> 00:36.898
They want to kill him.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.300
Something bad's going to happen.

00:39.403 --> 00:41.903
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.005 --> 00:43.138
There's panic.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.439
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:44.541 --> 00:45.940
I see dead people.

00:46.043 --> 00:48.209
They all died horribly.

00:48.311 --> 00:49.728
I speak to dead people.

00:49.813 --> 00:50.979
Get out of here.

00:51.081 --> 00:52.447
And they speak to me.

00:52.549 --> 00:54.282
Vicious.

00:54.384 --> 00:57.352
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.454 --> 00:59.220
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

00:59.322 --> 01:00.755
I rely on my partner.

01:00.857 --> 01:02.290
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.392 --> 01:04.391
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.494 --> 01:05.994
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:06.096 --> 01:09.264
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.332 --> 01:10.532
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:10.634 --> 01:12.500
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.602 --> 01:14.035
This is not good.

01:14.137 --> 01:15.837
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.939 --> 01:17.906
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.008 --> 01:19.908
Until the very end...

01:20.010 --> 01:21.209
I want my life back.

01:21.311 --> 01:23.278
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.380 --> 01:24.879
Is he trying to kill her?

01:24.981 --> 01:26.181
Or time to get out.

01:26.283 --> 01:27.716
Oh, my God.

01:27.818 --> 01:29.584
This is going to kill us.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:43.633 --> 01:45.633
I'm out here in Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

01:45.719 --> 01:46.835
I got called in by a woman

01:46.970 --> 01:49.838
who sounded pretty damn
scared on the phone.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.740
She says she's about to
take over a restaurant

01:51.825 --> 01:54.375
that's been in her family for 40 years.

01:54.461 --> 01:57.312
But the activity is so bad
she doesn't know if it's safe

01:57.397 --> 02:00.014
for her and her children to be there.

02:00.117 --> 02:01.583
She says, if Amy and I can't help her out,

02:01.685 --> 02:03.952
she may have to close the place up.

02:07.357 --> 02:09.723
Before Amy arrives,
I need to clear the restaurant

02:09.860 --> 02:13.528
of anything that might
influence her findings.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.314
Artwork, photographs

02:16.433 --> 02:20.001
and religious icons need
to be covered or removed.

02:20.103 --> 02:21.236
When I'm finished,

02:21.338 --> 02:23.471
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:31.698 --> 02:33.231
Okay.

02:35.318 --> 02:37.218
Before I got here, I saw this location.

02:37.320 --> 02:42.357
And there was, like, nothing,
you know, like, no buildings.

02:42.459 --> 02:46.494
It was all, like, just land and black.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.914
This thing, uh, came up to me.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.134
And it pointed to the ground.

02:53.236 --> 02:56.888
And then, I saw water trickling.

02:57.007 --> 03:01.643
And then, the water all of a
sudden was flowing with blood.

03:10.453 --> 03:11.352
So, Carla, I'm glad I'm here

03:11.454 --> 03:12.687
'cause, when we spoke on the phone,

03:12.772 --> 03:13.555
you sounded scared.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.056
Right.

03:15.158 --> 03:17.308
Okay. So give me a rundown
of what's going on.

03:17.394 --> 03:20.595
We've got people hearing noises,
objects moving,

03:20.680 --> 03:23.231
electrical problems, apparitions.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.634
And people are being touched.

03:26.736 --> 03:29.304
This business has been in
my family for 40 years.

03:29.389 --> 03:30.722
I'm taking over.

03:30.841 --> 03:32.707
My dad, this is his life's work.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.809
And it's part of the family.

03:34.895 --> 03:35.877
It's my whole life.

03:35.979 --> 03:38.663
But I also want to protect my children.

03:38.748 --> 03:40.782
I tell my kids that there's
nothing to be scared of,

03:40.917 --> 03:42.333
everything's fine.

03:42.452 --> 03:46.504
I'm not sure if I'm telling them the truth.

03:46.623 --> 03:49.474
Okay. So, now, who exactly works here?

03:49.593 --> 03:52.894
There's all of us. That's my mom. She's 82.

03:52.979 --> 03:54.512
That's my son. He's 16.

03:54.598 --> 03:58.299
That's me. That's my dad. He's 84.

03:58.435 --> 04:00.368
And that's my daughter. She's 13.

04:00.470 --> 04:04.873
My daughter particularly
has increased my concern.

04:04.975 --> 04:08.476
She's so genuinely frightened.

04:08.562 --> 04:10.228
Now, have you lost any, uh, staff

04:10.313 --> 04:11.512
- because of what's going on here?
- I have.

04:11.615 --> 04:14.899
And I've had to change
people's schedules also who...

04:15.018 --> 04:16.351
They'll, like, refuse to close

04:16.452 --> 04:19.070
or be alone in the restaurant at night.

04:19.154 --> 04:20.889
I mean, I don't like to be in
here alone at night either.

04:20.974 --> 04:22.340
I mean, how are you managing,
never mind everybody else?

04:22.425 --> 04:23.458
What about you?

04:23.560 --> 04:26.327
There's just days I don't want to come in.

04:26.429 --> 04:28.529
Sometimes, I get really anxious,

04:28.615 --> 04:30.398
particularly when I'm at work.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.300
Now, is that something you
experience away from here?

04:32.385 --> 04:33.468
No.

04:33.603 --> 04:35.203
What are you hoping we can do for you?

04:35.305 --> 04:38.740
I want you to tell me that I can stay here

04:38.825 --> 04:42.343
and I can honor my dad's life's work

04:42.445 --> 04:45.563
and I can be the good
daughter and the good mom.

04:49.903 --> 04:52.320
There's a lot going on.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.406
I mean, a lot of residual...

04:57.694 --> 05:01.896
There's a lot of men, pandemonium.

05:01.998 --> 05:03.281
They're drinking and partying.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.134
They're getting crazy.

05:06.219 --> 05:07.835
Do you think it would
affect the living here?

05:07.938 --> 05:11.606
Oh, I think that they
would feel, uh, dizzy.

05:13.843 --> 05:15.910
It's crowded. You feel this,

05:15.996 --> 05:18.112
feeling claustrophobic, you know?

05:18.214 --> 05:19.464
Very unsettled.

05:19.582 --> 05:21.633
Uh, your stomach kind of does flip-flops

05:21.751 --> 05:25.954
just because of all of this crazy,
uh, energy.

05:30.927 --> 05:33.594
So, why'd you bring me behind the bar here?

05:33.697 --> 05:36.998
This is where I feel something
breathing on my neck.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.666
What part of your neck do you feel it on?

05:38.752 --> 05:39.834
- Is it always on the same part?
- Mmhmm.

05:39.919 --> 05:41.419
- That side.
- Okay.

05:41.504 --> 05:42.370
So it's enough where it's...

05:42.472 --> 05:43.905
it's gonna go through your hair.

05:43.990 --> 05:44.739
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

05:44.824 --> 05:46.324
- Right.
- Okay.

05:46.409 --> 05:48.543
Now, how often does this happen to you?

05:48.678 --> 05:49.877
At least once a month.

05:49.963 --> 05:53.414
And when it's happening,
it seems like it's forever.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.216
Huh. Not like you got...

05:55.352 --> 05:57.051
No vents.

05:57.153 --> 05:59.020
Any other physical things happen here?

05:59.105 --> 06:04.492
So my back bothers me more
here than anyplace else.

06:04.561 --> 06:06.694
Now, what makes you think
this is paranormal?

06:06.780 --> 06:09.030
I can have had several
days of no back pain at all

06:09.115 --> 06:11.699
and get here and have my back start to...

06:11.785 --> 06:13.067
to feel badly.

06:13.153 --> 06:15.236
What if Amy tells you,
"It's not safe for you to stay here.

06:15.372 --> 06:16.971
You really need to go"?

06:17.040 --> 06:19.457
I feel very committed

06:19.542 --> 06:21.909
and responsible to keeping
the business running.

06:21.978 --> 06:24.479
But I wouldn't want my
kids to ever be harmed.

06:24.581 --> 06:26.948
Right. And so you're kind of
stuck right in the middle.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.816
Always.

06:31.021 --> 06:34.255
Somebody got stabbed to death.

06:34.357 --> 06:36.691
You know, this is, like, his area.

06:39.696 --> 06:42.597
Oh, he doesn't feel very, very good.

06:42.699 --> 06:44.699
It's a lot of pain.

06:44.834 --> 06:51.639
I think that people would
have physical pain

06:51.741 --> 06:55.426
associated with being around him,

06:55.512 --> 07:01.749
so, like, sudden lower-back issues,
acute stomach pain.

07:01.851 --> 07:05.253
Like, you'd be like, "Oh,"
you know, like, [bleep]

07:05.338 --> 07:09.090
He acts out when he's depressed. Ow.

07:11.628 --> 07:13.928
Yeah, they definitely feel
[bleep] pain with this guy.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.797
Come on.

07:19.069 --> 07:20.918
So, Edie, I'm really glad I
got a chance to talk to you

07:21.004 --> 07:23.488
'cause your mom's most concerned about you.

07:23.606 --> 07:25.973
- Yeah.
- Are you scared to be here?

07:26.076 --> 07:29.043
Whenever I'm here, I can never just relax.

07:29.129 --> 07:31.629
I'm always, "Was that just a shadow?"

07:31.714 --> 07:34.115
One night, close to midnight almost,

07:34.200 --> 07:36.734
I was just sitting in the dining
room playing a video game.

07:36.853 --> 07:40.421
And then, all of a sudden,
I heard, like, a woman cry,

07:40.507 --> 07:43.124
like a woman crying out in agony and pain.

07:43.226 --> 07:44.926
Any idea how old the woman that was moaning

07:45.061 --> 07:46.260
might have been?

07:46.362 --> 07:47.795
Maybe kind of middle-aged.

07:47.881 --> 07:49.130
Was anybody else in the building?

07:49.232 --> 07:51.482
My mom was in the kitchen
closing up the back door.

07:51.568 --> 07:53.634
Okay. Do you know if this door was locked?

07:53.736 --> 07:54.702
Yeah.

07:54.838 --> 07:57.171
That's strange.

07:57.257 --> 07:58.539
Now, is anything else going on?

07:58.625 --> 08:00.842
Well,
the scariest thing that has happened to me

08:00.927 --> 08:03.494
is I actually got trapped in the bathroom.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.480
- This bathroom here.
- Right there.

08:05.582 --> 08:07.014
I go in there. I use the bathroom.

08:07.117 --> 08:09.083
I wash my hands. I dry my hands.

08:09.185 --> 08:11.052
Then, I try to open up the door.

08:11.154 --> 08:14.589
And it was almost as if somebody
was pushing the door shut

08:14.674 --> 08:16.607
as I was trying to open it.

08:16.693 --> 08:17.692
You... you don't think
it was somebody playing

08:17.777 --> 08:19.494
- a game on you, do you?
- No, not at all.

08:19.596 --> 08:20.995
- How'd you get out of there?
- I kicked the door.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.196
So, ever since then,

08:22.332 --> 08:24.448
you've been pretty frightened
to death of this place.

08:24.534 --> 08:26.467
Yeah. I refuse to go to the bathroom alone

08:26.603 --> 08:27.518
at night anymore.

08:27.637 --> 08:30.037
Okay. All right.

08:30.173 --> 08:31.372
So, sweetie, it sounds
like you and your mom

08:31.457 --> 08:32.874
have a pretty close relationship.

08:33.009 --> 08:34.808
Oh, yeah. We're really close.

08:34.910 --> 08:38.078
I'm curious how you feel about
her being here alone at night.

08:38.181 --> 08:41.732
I don't know if something
would come actually at her.

08:41.818 --> 08:44.217
I just don't want anything
to happen to her.

08:47.524 --> 08:49.907
I feel anxious back here.

08:50.026 --> 08:52.560
I just hear, like, a... a male.

08:52.662 --> 08:55.379
He's like, "Ha ha, you stupid [bleep]"

08:55.465 --> 08:59.200
Like, "That'll teach ya."

08:59.302 --> 09:02.203
He seems like a stocky fella.

09:02.288 --> 09:03.871
Kind of making me sick.

09:03.973 --> 09:07.508
And he's got some guy,
drops him on the floor.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.079
And he's, like, kicking him.

09:12.165 --> 09:15.116
This guy killed this dude.

09:15.201 --> 09:16.450
Lots of anxiety, too,

09:16.536 --> 09:19.620
that they would feel back here,
like, heart racing.

09:23.309 --> 09:25.993
Something is with the doors.

09:26.129 --> 09:28.629
He's trying to keep the door closed

09:28.731 --> 09:32.750
'cause he's always like,
"Close the [bleep] door."

09:32.835 --> 09:34.468
He's a problem.

09:34.554 --> 09:36.604
Obviously, he was prone to violence.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.606
He killed someone.

09:38.691 --> 09:42.043
He could be physically
violent towards the living.

10:03.683 --> 10:05.115
The reason your mom called us in

10:05.217 --> 10:06.250
is because of the fact

10:06.319 --> 10:08.285
that she's worried about
you and your sister.

10:08.371 --> 10:09.620
It's a family-owned business.

10:09.755 --> 10:12.289
I mean, grandparents have
had it for over 40 years.

10:12.391 --> 10:14.708
She eventually wants you guys to take over.

10:14.827 --> 10:16.493
How do you feel about that?

10:16.579 --> 10:18.278
The business has been around for 40 years.

10:18.364 --> 10:20.781
And I'd love to keep it
around for another 40.

10:20.866 --> 10:23.167
But I don't feel comfortable
running a business

10:23.252 --> 10:25.552
in a building that's potentially haunted

10:25.638 --> 10:26.887
with entities that could harm people.

10:26.973 --> 10:29.873
Okay. Well, let me ask
you a question, then.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.291
Are you afraid to be here?

10:31.377 --> 10:32.960
Yes, especially at night.

10:33.079 --> 10:34.845
That's when I'm most afraid to be here.

10:34.981 --> 10:36.680
Okay. So, what experiences
have you had, Charley?

10:36.766 --> 10:38.649
So I've had two experiences.

10:38.784 --> 10:40.784
Throughout that door, into the Santos Room,

10:40.870 --> 10:43.387
I saw a cowboy sitting at
the last seat of the bar.

10:43.489 --> 10:44.922
And he's in a brown trench coat.

10:45.024 --> 10:46.140
And he has, like, a cowboy hat on.

10:46.225 --> 10:47.558
He's drinking a beer.

10:47.643 --> 10:49.026
And I thought that was really strange

10:49.111 --> 10:50.394
because it was, like, 8:00 in the morning.

10:50.496 --> 10:51.929
The restaurant wasn't open yet.

10:51.998 --> 10:53.364
And when I got through to the other side

10:53.466 --> 10:55.349
and I looked through
the bar and the gallery,

10:55.468 --> 10:56.800
there was nobody there.

10:56.936 --> 10:57.968
Okay. So, it just disappeared?

10:58.054 --> 10:59.720
Yes, it just disappeared.

10:59.839 --> 11:01.505
You said there were two things.
What was the second one?

11:01.590 --> 11:03.707
The second one actually
happened right behind us.

11:03.809 --> 11:05.793
I was going through that doorway.

11:05.911 --> 11:07.695
And as I passed through the hallway,

11:07.813 --> 11:09.380
I looked through the
double doors to the window.

11:09.482 --> 11:12.016
And I saw a woman floating there.

11:12.101 --> 11:13.917
But she had no arms and no legs.

11:14.003 --> 11:15.035
Her hair was down.

11:15.154 --> 11:16.570
How long would you say her hair was?

11:16.655 --> 11:19.640
Uh, it was probably about,
uh, 2... 2 feet long,

11:19.759 --> 11:21.942
kind of down to a little
bit past her shoulders.

11:22.061 --> 11:23.460
Did you think you were seeing things?

11:23.562 --> 11:24.845
Basically, I had, like, an anxiety attack.

11:24.964 --> 11:28.365
And I was crying and
traumatized, basically.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.838
There's, like, this little woman here,
probably in her 40s.

11:34.974 --> 11:37.307
She's chubby, short.

11:37.410 --> 11:38.675
She's a busybody.

11:38.778 --> 11:42.613
She seems really, um,
new to this whole thing,

11:42.715 --> 11:45.082
like, being dead.

11:45.217 --> 11:49.753
She's trying to interact
with this male and female.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.056
But she says,
"They're not hearing, you know,

11:52.158 --> 11:53.607
they're not hearing me."

11:53.692 --> 11:54.775
She's not seeing a reaction.

11:54.860 --> 11:55.893
Mm-hmm.

11:55.995 --> 11:58.796
Or, at least, the reaction she wants.

12:05.204 --> 12:06.970
So, Shirley, I was talking
to your daughter.

12:07.073 --> 12:09.423
And, uh,
she was explaining of some of the problems

12:09.508 --> 12:11.275
that are going on in the restaurant.

12:11.377 --> 12:12.526
Honestly, I'm... I worry about it.

12:12.611 --> 12:13.694
And I'm concerned about it.

12:13.779 --> 12:15.979
Particularly, I think Edie, she is scared.

12:16.065 --> 12:17.247
I don't want her to be afraid.

12:17.349 --> 12:19.249
And I don't want my daughter to be afraid,
you know?

12:19.335 --> 12:20.601
Right.

12:20.719 --> 12:23.587
My partner, when she does these cases,

12:23.689 --> 12:25.773
and then, at the end,
sometimes, she'll tell them,

12:25.858 --> 12:27.991
"Listen,
you need to get the hell out of here

12:28.077 --> 12:29.226
or close your business."

12:29.328 --> 12:32.513
How would you feel about
something like that?

12:32.598 --> 12:33.730
Would not want to do it.

12:33.833 --> 12:36.300
This is the legacy for my family,

12:36.435 --> 12:39.036
what my husband and I have
built all these many years.

12:39.138 --> 12:41.939
And, uh, I want it for my
daughter and my grandchildren.

12:42.024 --> 12:43.474
I would not want to go.

12:43.609 --> 12:44.858
In the 40 years you've been here,

12:44.944 --> 12:46.794
have you had any experiences?

12:46.879 --> 12:49.046
Well, actually, the first 32 years,

12:49.131 --> 12:51.348
I really didn't have any
personal experiences.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.851
But about eight years ago, I did, yes.

12:53.936 --> 12:55.018
Okay. So, what happened?

12:55.154 --> 12:57.621
Late one night, I opened up that door.

12:57.723 --> 12:59.890
The minute I stepped into this room,

12:59.975 --> 13:02.559
a ghost lady came... I was standing there.

13:02.695 --> 13:04.261
She came from this side of the room...

13:04.363 --> 13:05.195
Okay.

13:05.331 --> 13:06.914
At me so fast, and then,

13:07.032 --> 13:09.616
like, swoosh, right passing through me.

13:09.735 --> 13:12.569
I turned totally, totally cold,
totally, totally cold.

13:12.655 --> 13:14.138
Can you describe her at all?

13:14.223 --> 13:15.772
- I would say small.
- Small.

13:15.858 --> 13:17.374
- Small, yes.
- Okay.

13:17.476 --> 13:19.576
Was that the only experience
that you actually had here?

13:19.662 --> 13:20.911
Uh, no.

13:21.013 --> 13:23.597
We actually had something
strange happening in here

13:23.716 --> 13:24.982
with the lights.

13:25.084 --> 13:26.083
Maybe two or three of them

13:26.185 --> 13:27.601
would just be flickering, flickering.

13:27.686 --> 13:30.387
So I had two different electricians come.

13:30.523 --> 13:32.556
So, what did the
electricians wind up saying?

13:32.691 --> 13:35.659
Neither company that ever
came out ever found anything.

13:38.430 --> 13:42.232
That little woman, she is very frustrated.

13:42.334 --> 13:46.069
She's very angry with them
when they're not talking to her

13:46.172 --> 13:48.071
or listening to her or whatever, you know?

13:48.174 --> 13:49.306
She gets real worked up.

13:49.391 --> 13:53.243
And then, I see her hair,
uh, get all, like, crazy.

13:53.329 --> 13:55.212
Uh, so she's, like,
whipping around in a circle

13:55.314 --> 13:58.415
and freaking out.

13:58.517 --> 14:00.717
I think, that at those times,

14:00.819 --> 14:04.555
maybe the living might have
some electrical issues.

14:06.292 --> 14:08.859
And the living might notice that.

14:13.315 --> 14:17.134
I think this is where the
little lady is mostly.

14:17.219 --> 14:19.970
She's, like, bopping around, you know,

14:20.055 --> 14:22.890
and, like, just in everybody's [bleep]

14:22.975 --> 14:26.743
And I do see her getting in a rage.

14:28.614 --> 14:30.914
Ooh, she's not happy.

14:31.016 --> 14:32.849
She's kind of having a mental breakdown.

14:48.579 --> 14:49.662
I didn't think it
would be hard to find history

14:49.780 --> 14:51.030
on Carla's restaurant.

14:51.115 --> 14:54.283
I mean, after all,
it sits right in the middle of Old Town.

14:54.368 --> 14:56.285
Turns out, it was easier than I thought.

14:56.370 --> 14:57.953
The first historian I reached out to

14:58.089 --> 14:59.922
said that one of the early
owners of the property

15:00.007 --> 15:03.459
suffered through years of debt,
regret and betrayal.

15:08.399 --> 15:09.832
So, Julia, you mentioned on the phone

15:09.917 --> 15:11.200
one of the first owners of the property

15:11.285 --> 15:13.369
I'm investigating had a
lot of heartache there.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.737
What'd you mean by that?

15:14.839 --> 15:19.208
- Carlos and Felicitas Vigil
were married in 1910... - Okay.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.611
And moved into the property in 1920.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.380
She was pregnant with her third child

15:24.515 --> 15:26.398
when they moved into the property.

15:26.484 --> 15:28.767
About five months after they moved in,

15:28.853 --> 15:30.819
their youngest, a little boy named Willie,

15:30.888 --> 15:33.289
he passed away.

15:33.374 --> 15:34.590
Okay. What was the cause?

15:34.675 --> 15:36.375
Gastritis.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.027
How'd it go for them after that?

15:38.129 --> 15:39.495
Ernesto was born.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.163
But he did pass away as well.

15:41.299 --> 15:43.632
He was 1 year, 1 month old.

15:43.768 --> 15:47.603
He had an infection that was
caused from bottle feeding.

15:48.773 --> 15:52.808
And he passed away in 1922.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.761
However, Felicitas becomes pregnant again.

15:55.846 --> 15:57.646
Her name was Frances.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.566
But Frances was only 2 months old

16:00.651 --> 16:01.817
when she passed away.

16:01.953 --> 16:03.035
Geez.

16:03.154 --> 16:08.223
She died in April of 1924
of a bronchial pneumonia.

16:08.359 --> 16:10.326
I'm afraid to even ask.
Did they have any more kids?

16:10.411 --> 16:11.360
They did.

16:11.445 --> 16:14.513
This time, the baby was stillborn.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.765
Felicitas was so devastated

16:16.901 --> 16:19.652
she couldn't even bring
herself to name the child.

16:21.639 --> 16:24.123
I mean, just losing one child
alone has got to destroy you.

16:24.241 --> 16:25.474
Destroy you.

16:25.559 --> 16:27.559
She lost four.

16:27.678 --> 16:29.428
Four in a row.

16:29.513 --> 16:33.666
Not very long after the stillborn, um,

16:33.784 --> 16:36.035
Carlos actually became ill.

16:36.153 --> 16:38.203
And what was his problem?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.254
Syphilis.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.557
Turns out, Carlos was unfaithful.

16:41.642 --> 16:42.441
Ah, so now I know what you meant

16:42.560 --> 16:44.426
when you said about betrayal.

16:44.512 --> 16:46.662
She actually had him committed

16:46.797 --> 16:49.665
to the New Mexico Hospital for the Insane

16:49.767 --> 16:52.201
until he passes away in 1927.

16:52.286 --> 16:54.136
And when he died,

16:54.271 --> 16:56.121
she did not claim his body.

16:56.207 --> 16:57.773
Does she stay? Does she
decide to move away?

16:57.858 --> 16:59.074
No, she stays.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.777
She does, uh, start to become quite ill.

17:01.912 --> 17:04.113
And eventually, she does have a stroke.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.914
And she died in January of 1959.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.983
Okay. So now, she dies in '59.
What happens to the property?

17:09.069 --> 17:12.354
She left the property to
her surviving children.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.106
Uh, they kept it for a few years.

17:14.224 --> 17:16.125
But then, they sold the property.

17:16.210 --> 17:19.595
15 years after Felicitas died,

17:19.680 --> 17:22.765
the building became the High
Noon Restaurant and Saloon.

17:25.636 --> 17:29.972
This angry woman,
she died fairly recently, I think,

17:30.074 --> 17:31.607
maybe, like, a sudden heart attack

17:31.709 --> 17:34.009
or something along those lines.

17:34.111 --> 17:35.978
Do you know how old she was?

17:36.080 --> 17:41.100
Uh, she looks, mm, maybe 50s or 60s.

17:41.218 --> 17:44.219
And she's, like,
being very obsessed with her family.

17:44.321 --> 17:49.622
Yeah, she's feeling more grateful about the
decision to do with her family in this building,

17:51.157 --> 17:52.679
maybe leaving it to them or something.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.515
Like, I am seeing a For Sale sign.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.285
Mm, she's not happy.

18:01.434 --> 18:02.784
I've already uncovered five people

18:02.886 --> 18:06.671
who died on my client's property,
four of them children.

18:06.756 --> 18:08.055
But I need to see if there's anything else

18:08.191 --> 18:11.192
that can help my case.

18:11.327 --> 18:12.527
Searching through old records,

18:12.612 --> 18:15.730
I find a 16-year-old
who was fatally stabbed.

18:15.832 --> 18:17.515
Turns out, he lived right across the street

18:17.634 --> 18:20.802
from Carla's restaurant.

18:20.937 --> 18:22.186
I need to find out a lot more

18:22.305 --> 18:24.589
about this brutal attack
on the 16-year-old kid.

18:24.707 --> 18:26.374
And when I want to know about a homicide,

18:26.509 --> 18:28.009
I reach out to the cops.

18:28.094 --> 18:30.094
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police officer

18:30.213 --> 18:32.330
who's looking into this case for me.

18:38.872 --> 18:40.788
Well, Officer Tixier,
thanks so much for helping me out

18:40.874 --> 18:41.956
with this case. I appreciate it.

18:42.058 --> 18:43.724
- My pleasure.
- So, can you do me a favor?

18:43.827 --> 18:46.027
Before we get to the murder
of this 16-year-old kid,

18:46.129 --> 18:47.628
what do you know about the family?

18:47.714 --> 18:49.130
Luis Moya moved his family

18:49.215 --> 18:51.766
onto your client's property in 1941.

18:51.835 --> 18:54.268
And then, just a short time,
five years later,

18:54.370 --> 18:56.053
he moves his family off
your client's property

18:56.139 --> 18:58.189
but just directly across the street.

18:58.308 --> 18:59.473
So, they're in the immediate area

18:59.559 --> 19:01.125
when this homicide happens?

19:01.211 --> 19:02.176
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

19:02.262 --> 19:03.878
So take me through the homicide.

19:03.980 --> 19:07.298
So, uh, Luis Moya has a son, Freddy Moya.

19:07.383 --> 19:08.599
Him and his friend,

19:08.718 --> 19:10.735
they walk down the street
to a New Year's Eve party

19:10.820 --> 19:13.104
that was being held at the armory,

19:13.189 --> 19:15.289
basically to ring in 1951 into '52.

19:15.425 --> 19:16.374
As they walk into the party,

19:16.459 --> 19:18.192
they kind of separate, go their own ways.

19:18.294 --> 19:20.177
And as the night is progressing,

19:20.296 --> 19:22.930
a group of about 10 to 13 individuals

19:23.016 --> 19:25.366
from the Atrisco street
gang come into the party.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.118
And I can see where this is going already.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.470
One of those people was Paul Garcia.

19:29.572 --> 19:30.288
Okay.

19:30.406 --> 19:31.906
Details are sketchy about

19:31.991 --> 19:33.708
what exactly transpired between the two.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.243
But what we do know is that

19:35.378 --> 19:38.312
a lot of witnesses saw a commotion

19:38.414 --> 19:41.382
between Paul Garcia and Freddy Moya.

19:41.467 --> 19:42.850
Okay.

19:42.952 --> 19:45.386
And then, they saw Freddy turn pale.

19:45.488 --> 19:46.370
They take him out of the armory.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.705
And that's when they realized

19:47.824 --> 19:49.924
that he had been stabbed
pretty severely twice,

19:50.026 --> 19:52.560
once in the back and
then once in his chest.

19:52.645 --> 19:55.696
And that chest wound
actually severed his aorta.

19:55.798 --> 19:57.331
- So he bled out.
- Bled out almost immediately.

19:57.417 --> 19:58.266
Okay.

19:58.368 --> 19:59.634
Paul Garcia confessed,

19:59.719 --> 20:02.086
was found guilty and did 15 years for it.

20:02.205 --> 20:03.471
Okay.

20:03.573 --> 20:05.106
What a way to bring in the
new year for a family, huh?

20:05.191 --> 20:07.742
Yes, sir.

20:07.844 --> 20:10.711
I'm seeing a lot of fighting.

20:10.813 --> 20:15.766
The guy who's got stabbed, he's back here.

20:19.255 --> 20:21.389
Frankie, Frank.

20:21.491 --> 20:23.691
I'm seeing the guy who got stabbed again.

20:23.793 --> 20:28.195
But this time, he's making me
experience his painful death.

20:28.331 --> 20:29.664
Really bad, too.

20:29.766 --> 20:33.567
He got stabbed in the front and the back.

20:33.653 --> 20:35.069
I'm just feeling it.

20:35.154 --> 20:39.724
I think he feels betrayed and,
like, got murdered.

20:58.935 --> 21:01.069
You know,
another thing stood out in my research.

21:01.187 --> 21:02.787
The local town marshal

21:02.889 --> 21:05.890
was hanged just down the
street from Carla's restaurant.

21:05.975 --> 21:07.258
Now, you don't hear about law enforcement

21:07.394 --> 21:08.976
getting the death penalty very often.

21:09.062 --> 21:10.228
So I called a local author

21:10.313 --> 21:12.630
who said Milton Yarberry was so hated

21:12.766 --> 21:15.716
people lined the streets
to cheer his execution.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.243
So, Johnny,
this story's pretty interesting to me.

21:25.328 --> 21:26.310
So there was a town marshal

21:26.413 --> 21:28.229
that was actually hanged
right down the block

21:28.348 --> 21:29.781
from my client's property.

21:29.866 --> 21:31.099
Milton Yarberry.

21:31.217 --> 21:33.351
He's born in 1849 in Arkansas,

21:33.436 --> 21:37.054
joins an outlaw gang,
kills a couple men in Arkansas.

21:37.140 --> 21:41.159
And that's gonna send him
fleeing Arkansas into Texas.

21:41.244 --> 21:43.261
Okay. So he's got a couple
murders under his belt already.

21:43.329 --> 21:45.496
By 1879, at least four.

21:45.582 --> 21:46.731
Wow. How does a guy

21:46.816 --> 21:48.900
that's got at least four
bodies under his belt

21:49.002 --> 21:52.320
wind up in Albuquerque and as a marshal?

21:52.405 --> 21:54.655
He arrives in Albuquerque in 1880.

21:54.741 --> 21:56.908
He's traveling with a woman named Sadie

21:57.010 --> 21:59.444
and her 4-year-old daughter.

21:59.529 --> 22:03.881
When he arrives here,
he's gonna befriend Perfecto Armijo,

22:03.967 --> 22:05.550
who is the county sheriff.

22:05.652 --> 22:08.252
Perfecto gets Yarberry the job

22:08.338 --> 22:10.705
as Albuquerque's first town marshal.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.223
He apparently liked the way

22:12.308 --> 22:15.259
Yarberry knew his way around guns.

22:15.395 --> 22:16.994
And this is Yarberry here.

22:17.096 --> 22:18.196
That's Yarberry.

22:18.331 --> 22:19.363
Looks like a tough piece of work.

22:19.499 --> 22:20.948
Yeah, he does.

22:21.034 --> 22:22.633
So, this guy doesn't know
anything about his background?

22:22.735 --> 22:24.702
- No.
- Geez.

22:24.804 --> 22:26.137
So now you got a killer with a badge.

22:26.272 --> 22:27.605
How does this work out for the town?

22:27.690 --> 22:31.526
In 1881, Sadie,
the woman he came to town with,

22:31.644 --> 22:34.745
is apparently seeing another man,
Harry Brown.

22:34.831 --> 22:39.050
So Yarberry comes to talk to Harry Brown.

22:39.152 --> 22:40.868
I'm assuming he probably shot him.

22:40.987 --> 22:43.588
Shot him twice. Killed him.

22:43.723 --> 22:47.959
And Perfecto Armijo has
to arrest his friend.

22:48.094 --> 22:49.010
What happens with Brown?

22:49.128 --> 22:50.278
Well, during the trial,

22:50.363 --> 22:53.598
it's brought out that Brown had a gun.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.733
Yarberry pleads self-defense.

22:55.818 --> 22:56.934
And the jury acquits him.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.036
Within a few weeks,

22:59.122 --> 23:01.973
he's back on the job as the town marshal.

23:02.058 --> 23:04.942
But a few weeks after that shooting,

23:05.028 --> 23:06.160
there's another one.

23:06.279 --> 23:09.180
And that one's gonna get
Yarberry in serious trouble.

23:09.265 --> 23:12.049
He's investigating a shot
that's been heard fired in town.

23:12.151 --> 23:14.018
He sees a man running down the street.

23:14.103 --> 23:15.436
He yells stop.

23:15.555 --> 23:18.089
When the man doesn't stop,
Yarberry shoots him.

23:18.191 --> 23:19.924
Again, the charge is murder.

23:20.009 --> 23:23.094
And this time, it takes the jury 10 minutes

23:23.229 --> 23:25.563
to find him guilty.

23:25.698 --> 23:30.017
And Milton Yarberry is sentenced to hang.

23:30.103 --> 23:32.236
2,000 people showed up.

23:32.322 --> 23:34.205
They are lining the streets.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.039
They are heckling.

23:35.174 --> 23:36.941
They are booing him.

23:39.629 --> 23:41.729
I'm hearing a lot of men yelling.

23:41.848 --> 23:44.649
Uh, I think they're angry.

23:44.751 --> 23:47.685
Um...

23:47.787 --> 23:52.623
it seems like there's something
big happening, going down.

23:52.725 --> 23:55.459
And they're, like, on top of buildings.

23:55.595 --> 23:59.380
But they...
but the buildings kind of look different.

23:59.499 --> 24:00.364
Somebody did something.

24:00.466 --> 24:01.882
They want to kill him.

24:02.001 --> 24:04.335
They're walking this
man through the streets.

24:04.437 --> 24:06.270
And he did something very bad.

24:08.575 --> 24:12.093
It's like he's on parade or something.

24:12.178 --> 24:13.611
It was a circus.

24:13.713 --> 24:15.913
In fact, I found this article.

24:15.999 --> 24:18.099
Local businesses were selling tickets.

24:18.217 --> 24:21.068
For a dollar,
you could go up to the rooftop.

24:21.154 --> 24:24.689
So it's likely that the
business you're investigating,

24:24.774 --> 24:27.908
people were up on that roof
watching the execution.

24:28.027 --> 24:29.760
Wow.

24:29.862 --> 24:32.597
But it doesn't go as planned.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.065
Armijo found in a journal

24:34.150 --> 24:36.667
this new method of hanging somebody.

24:36.753 --> 24:37.952
It's called the jerk method.

24:38.037 --> 24:40.004
And it's supposed to be a more humane way

24:40.089 --> 24:41.973
of executing somebody.

24:42.108 --> 24:45.676
But when he's jerked up,
his head hits the crossbeam,

24:45.778 --> 24:47.628
and his skull is crushed.

24:47.714 --> 24:49.380
This execution is so botched

24:49.465 --> 24:52.216
they can't get the noose off his neck.

24:52.302 --> 24:54.986
So he's buried with the rope still on him.

24:55.071 --> 24:58.255
Wow.

24:58.358 --> 24:59.924
He's white.

25:00.026 --> 25:01.692
He's well-known.

25:01.778 --> 25:04.395
I don't know if he was, like,
maybe some kind of lawman

25:04.497 --> 25:07.999
or some [bleep]

25:08.084 --> 25:11.469
He says that sometimes,
he wasn't always a lawman.

25:11.554 --> 25:13.704
So, what the [bleep] was done to him?

25:13.790 --> 25:15.456
But I don't know.

25:15.575 --> 25:17.842
I think the guy gets hanged.

25:28.021 --> 25:30.354
I saw several dead people during my walk.

25:30.456 --> 25:32.523
But two stood out the most.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.626
First, the killer I saw in the kitchen.

25:35.762 --> 25:38.963
He is late 30s maybe.

25:39.065 --> 25:42.967
He had a very Italian-looking nose.

25:43.052 --> 25:47.388
And his eyes were closer
together than normal.

25:47.473 --> 25:49.173
Next, I described the angry woman

25:49.275 --> 25:51.809
trying to get the living's attention.

25:51.894 --> 25:56.514
She was, like,
grabbing his arm, shaking him.

25:56.616 --> 26:00.184
She has really long, black hair.

26:00.286 --> 26:01.452
And when she gets mad,

26:01.537 --> 26:03.988
it's kind of, like, whipping around.

26:11.864 --> 26:13.397
Is this what you saw?

26:14.834 --> 26:16.500
Yes.

26:36.709 --> 26:39.715
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:39.815 --> 26:41.014
we're ready to reveal our findings

26:41.116 --> 26:44.451
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

26:44.553 --> 26:46.052
Now, Amy, in 1974,

26:46.188 --> 26:48.421
Shirley and her husband
opened this restaurant.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.390
It took a lot of blood, sweat and tears.

26:50.492 --> 26:52.492
But it became a success.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.027
Recently, they turned the High Noon over

26:54.129 --> 26:55.495
to their daughter, Carla.

26:55.597 --> 26:57.330
And that's kind of when
the trouble started.

26:57.432 --> 26:59.032
Activity's gotten physical.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.068
And Carla's two kids are
pretty scared to be here.

27:02.171 --> 27:04.020
This is actually a photo of the two kids.

27:04.139 --> 27:06.189
This is Charley, who's 16.

27:06.275 --> 27:08.208
And this is Edie, who's 13.

27:08.310 --> 27:10.010
Now, Carla's in a tough spot.

27:10.145 --> 27:11.945
She wants to honor the family legacy

27:12.080 --> 27:14.981
and keep the restaurant going.

27:15.083 --> 27:16.399
But she's also a worried mom.

27:16.485 --> 27:18.151
And she doesn't want to stay here

27:18.253 --> 27:19.586
if it's not safe for her kids.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.888
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

27:21.974 --> 27:23.924
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

27:27.129 --> 27:28.628
When I first got here,

27:28.730 --> 27:32.365
there was this commotion going on outside.

27:32.467 --> 27:35.168
Uh, there were a lot of men.

27:35.270 --> 27:37.771
And they were yelling and screaming

27:37.906 --> 27:39.973
and just kind of going nuts.

27:40.058 --> 27:43.710
A lot of them were on the rooftops.

27:43.812 --> 27:45.879
Then, I noticed a group of men

27:46.014 --> 27:48.215
kind of walking down the street.

27:48.350 --> 27:50.650
In the center of all of these men

27:50.752 --> 27:54.137
was this one man that they
were kind of manhandling.

27:54.223 --> 27:57.424
They hated him and wanted to kill him.

27:57.526 --> 28:01.111
And then, I believe that he was hanged.

28:01.230 --> 28:02.429
Wow.

28:02.531 --> 28:04.214
I didn't really have to think
about this one too long.

28:04.299 --> 28:07.400
There was a guy in 1883 by
the name of Milton Yarberry,

28:07.502 --> 28:09.352
who was hanged just down the block here.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.353
Okay.

28:10.472 --> 28:13.139
Milton was born in Arkansas in 1849.

28:13.242 --> 28:15.408
He started a life of crime pretty young.

28:15.510 --> 28:17.561
By the time he got to Albuquerque in 1880,

28:17.646 --> 28:19.179
he had already killed four men.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.666
I actually managed to
track down a photo of him.

28:24.820 --> 28:25.886
Wow.

28:25.988 --> 28:27.387
Pretty intense-looking guy.

28:27.489 --> 28:31.041
Now, somehow, this illiterate murderer

28:31.126 --> 28:34.828
became friendly with the
local sheriff of Albuquerque.

28:34.913 --> 28:37.631
He was Perfecto Armijo.

28:37.733 --> 28:39.232
Perfecto made a bad decision

28:39.368 --> 28:42.485
and made Yarberry Albuquerque's
first town marshal.

28:44.406 --> 28:46.740
Now, Yarberry finds out that his girlfriend

28:46.842 --> 28:49.609
was cheating on him with
this guy named Harry Brown.

28:49.711 --> 28:52.078
So, how does he handle it?
Handles it with a gun.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.347
Tracks him down.
And he shoots him, kills him.

28:54.449 --> 28:56.750
He was tried for murder even
though he was the marshal.

28:56.852 --> 28:58.084
But he was acquitted.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.770
Now, you think he would lay
low after that happened.

29:00.889 --> 29:01.755
He didn't.

29:01.857 --> 29:03.156
Only a few weeks later,

29:03.241 --> 29:06.760
he winds up, uh,
responding to a shots-fired-type call.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.495
And he sees a guy, tells him to stop.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.996
He's walking away.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.666
And he shoots him three times
in the back and kills him.

29:12.768 --> 29:14.117
He gets tried again.

29:14.236 --> 29:17.921
This time,
he's found guilty and sentenced to hang.

29:19.341 --> 29:22.008
Now, on February 9, 1883,

29:22.094 --> 29:23.944
he was paraded through the
streets here in Old Town

29:24.029 --> 29:26.112
on the way to the gallows.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.614
Wow.

29:27.716 --> 29:29.115
Now, you said people were drunk
and rowdy and stuff like that?

29:29.217 --> 29:30.283
Oh, yeah.

29:30.419 --> 29:32.335
Building owners here
wind up selling tickets

29:32.454 --> 29:34.037
for $1 apiece for people

29:34.122 --> 29:36.172
to actually watch the
hangings from the roof.

29:36.291 --> 29:37.490
So, most likely, people

29:37.592 --> 29:40.226
were cheering his execution
on your rooftop that day.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.561
Wow.

29:41.697 --> 29:45.098
Interesting.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.634
So, uh, what else?

29:47.736 --> 29:50.654
There's three different
conscious dead people here.

29:50.772 --> 29:52.806
One of them was a female.

29:52.941 --> 29:54.708
She was in her 40s.

29:54.810 --> 29:57.978
I met her in the reception area.

29:58.747 --> 30:00.981
What?

30:01.066 --> 30:02.382
Continue talking. It's a...

30:02.467 --> 30:03.750
Okay.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.252
The other area that she
likes to hang out at

30:06.355 --> 30:09.322
is that dining area.

30:09.424 --> 30:10.573
She was short.

30:10.659 --> 30:13.226
She had extremely long, beautiful hair.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.295
And it was dark.

30:15.430 --> 30:16.963
She was attempting to interact

30:17.049 --> 30:18.932
with the living male and female,

30:19.017 --> 30:22.318
trying to talk to them
and trying to grab them,

30:22.404 --> 30:24.137
trying to shake them.

30:24.272 --> 30:29.259
And she feels like they're not hearing her.

30:29.378 --> 30:33.396
And she would get extremely upset.

30:33.515 --> 30:35.648
When that would occur,

30:35.717 --> 30:39.686
her hair would go up and get all crazy.

30:39.771 --> 30:43.189
And this is how she's
expressing her frustration.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.924
Now, the reason they
reacted the way they did

30:45.060 --> 30:46.726
when you described her in that room

30:46.828 --> 30:49.396
is a lot of people have seen this woman.

30:49.531 --> 30:50.730
Lots of people.

30:50.832 --> 30:53.450
I stepped into the dining
room very late one night.

30:53.535 --> 30:55.685
And the minute I stepped into the room,

30:55.804 --> 30:58.138
she just came rushing at me and went, like,

30:58.223 --> 30:59.622
like, right through me.

30:59.741 --> 31:02.175
I screamed. I really screamed.

31:02.260 --> 31:06.563
Now, the funny thing is Charley,
your son, saw a similar thing.

31:06.681 --> 31:08.681
Explain to Amy what Charley had seen.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.784
He was walking down the back hallway

31:10.869 --> 31:13.119
and just looked through the windows

31:13.255 --> 31:16.556
and saw a figure, a woman in white...

31:16.641 --> 31:18.091
- White. Hmm.
- ...in this room.

31:18.176 --> 31:19.642
Okay.

31:19.761 --> 31:22.328
So I had a sketch done of this woman.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.664
And she was trying to,

31:24.750 --> 31:28.968
um, get the attention of a particular male.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.639
Oh, geez.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.508
This is how she looked when you saw her?

31:35.577 --> 31:37.177
That's upset, all right.

31:41.450 --> 31:43.349
That's scary.

31:43.452 --> 31:45.452
That's where I work mostly.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.053
That's definitely the space

31:47.155 --> 31:50.290
where so many people feel,
you know, a presence.

31:51.893 --> 31:53.827
In my mind,
I was thinking she wanted me out of there.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.962
She wanted me out of her space.
She wanted me out of her place.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.748
Interesting. Okay.

31:58.834 --> 31:59.799
Now, did you get any idea

31:59.885 --> 32:02.035
who this woman might have been in life?

32:02.137 --> 32:04.487
She knew that she was ill before she died.

32:04.606 --> 32:08.174
But her actual death
came pretty sudden, uh,

32:08.260 --> 32:10.577
something like a sudden heart attack.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.679
She might have died recently.

32:12.781 --> 32:15.648
She looked like she was in her 60s.

32:15.734 --> 32:20.737
Um, there seemed to be
some issue with her family.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.939
I did see a For Sale sign.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.025
And she was absolutely unhappy about it.

32:26.128 --> 32:30.096
I think that she regretted the decision

32:30.182 --> 32:32.899
that she made about this location

32:32.984 --> 32:35.368
and possibly leaving it to her children.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.804
That's interesting.
That's really interesting.

32:37.889 --> 32:40.056
There was a woman that
lived on the property here

32:40.175 --> 32:42.475
that suffered a lot during her time here.

32:42.577 --> 32:45.411
Felicity Vigil and her husband at the time,
Carlos,

32:45.514 --> 32:47.380
bought this property in 1920.

32:47.516 --> 32:49.499
After moving here, she lost four kids...

32:49.584 --> 32:50.750
Whoa.

32:50.852 --> 32:53.386
Within five years,
all under the age of 2.

32:53.488 --> 32:55.188
Now, to make things worse for this woman,

32:55.257 --> 32:57.390
her husband contracted syphilis.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.608
Now, she didn't have it,

32:58.727 --> 33:01.477
which only meant that he
had to be cheating on her.

33:01.563 --> 33:04.113
But the disease damaged Carlos' brain.

33:04.199 --> 33:08.168
And she had him committed to
the state mental hospital.

33:08.270 --> 33:10.470
Now, he died in 1927.

33:10.555 --> 33:12.305
I got his death certificate here.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.774
She didn't even claim his body.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.743
She just left it there.

33:16.878 --> 33:19.078
Now, Amy, you mentioned this
woman suffered from a disease

33:19.164 --> 33:20.330
and then died suddenly.

33:20.448 --> 33:23.650
Felicitas suffered from high blood pressure

33:23.752 --> 33:26.252
and caused her to have a stroke in 1959.

33:26.388 --> 33:29.756
I have her death certificate here.

33:29.858 --> 33:32.358
Now, she was here a long time, 39 years.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.494
But she died on the property.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.563
Now, you mentioned she had
regret about leaving this place

33:36.648 --> 33:38.815
to her kids,
and that's exactly what she did.

33:38.900 --> 33:40.567
She left it to her daughter and two sons.

33:40.669 --> 33:42.702
- Okay.
- Now, just a few years

33:42.837 --> 33:46.239
after they got the property after she died,
they sold it.

33:46.374 --> 33:48.458
It's kind of sad when you think about that,
you know?

33:48.543 --> 33:51.010
So she probably said, "Oh, look.
I'm leaving you this.

33:51.096 --> 33:52.779
It's our legacy,"
kind of like the way your mother

33:52.914 --> 33:53.913
and father are leaving you...

33:53.999 --> 33:55.031
- Right.
- ...the restaurant, you know?

33:55.116 --> 33:56.916
And... and here, her
kids just abandoned it.

33:57.018 --> 33:59.252
It's sad. It's very sad.

34:01.323 --> 34:02.689
Now, you said there were three dead people.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.007
Who else did you see?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.992
I encountered a male

34:06.077 --> 34:09.112
who apparently was being
stabbed in the front

34:09.197 --> 34:12.599
and then got him a couple
of times in the back.

34:12.701 --> 34:15.034
I got the name Frank or Frankie with him.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.870
He was indicating that he felt betrayed,

34:17.956 --> 34:20.572
and he feels a lot of pain and depression.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.574
So I felt like, around the bar area,

34:22.710 --> 34:25.878
people would feel this kind of pain,
stomach pain,

34:25.964 --> 34:27.380
lower-back pain.

34:27.514 --> 34:28.947
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

34:29.050 --> 34:30.750
Tell Amy about that.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.051
I get the back pain.

34:32.187 --> 34:33.652
Okay.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.420
You know,
I think I'm gonna be able to figure out

34:35.507 --> 34:38.775
who this might be for
Amy and for you as well.

34:38.860 --> 34:40.076
You said the name Frankie.

34:40.195 --> 34:41.277
Yes.

34:41.362 --> 34:42.545
The guy I'm gonna tell you about,

34:42.664 --> 34:44.414
his name is Freddy Moya.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.416
Now, Freddy was a kid who lived
on the property with his parents

34:46.501 --> 34:48.034
from '41 to '46.

34:48.136 --> 34:49.735
Then, they moved right across the street.

34:49.871 --> 34:50.969
When Freddy was 16,

34:51.056 --> 34:53.856
he went with a friend to
a New Year's Eve party

34:53.975 --> 34:55.341
right down the street at the armory.

34:55.476 --> 34:57.310
They were ringing in 1952.

34:57.412 --> 35:00.647
Now, 13 gang members from
the Atrisco neighborhood

35:00.782 --> 35:02.065
wind up coming into the party.

35:02.150 --> 35:04.784
And, uh, Freddy was attacked
by one of the gang members.

35:04.886 --> 35:07.620
He was stabbed several times
exactly where you said...

35:07.756 --> 35:08.655
Oh, wow.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.556
The chest and in the back.

35:10.659 --> 35:12.792
Now, the stab wound in the
front is what killed him.

35:12.877 --> 35:15.295
It was so bad it severed his aorta.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.729
Then, five minutes after midnight,

35:16.815 --> 35:18.698
he was pronounced dead.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.550
Now, do you think this could
be the kid you ran into?

35:20.669 --> 35:21.467
Yes.

35:21.603 --> 35:23.019
Okay.

35:23.138 --> 35:26.272
So we have the lady who died
and the stabbing victim.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.374
But you said there was a third dead person.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.226
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- So, who was that?

35:30.345 --> 35:33.479
The third dead person I ran
into was in the kitchen area.

35:33.581 --> 35:36.349
And he's the one I'm most concerned about.

35:36.451 --> 35:39.335
Immediately, I felt sick, uh, nauseous.

35:39.454 --> 35:42.238
Um, I felt intense neck pain.

35:42.324 --> 35:45.958
And then, I felt like hands
were on my neck squeezing.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.094
I heard a male laughing and saying,

35:48.229 --> 35:51.014
"You stupid [bleep] That'll teach ya."

35:51.099 --> 35:56.602
I saw the image of one
man killing another man.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.939
I got that he was stocky
and seemed to be in his 30s.

36:00.041 --> 36:03.076
Because he was such a violent,
nasty person in life,

36:03.161 --> 36:07.547
he could possibly, uh,
be violent and nasty in death.

36:07.632 --> 36:10.683
The other thing...
He's kind of obsessed with doors.

36:10.785 --> 36:14.537
He has to have the doors closed.

36:14.622 --> 36:16.489
Talk about Edie with the bathroom incident.

36:16.558 --> 36:19.192
Right. So my daughter went to the restroom.

36:19.294 --> 36:21.310
And when she went to
open that bathroom door

36:21.396 --> 36:23.062
to pull it open, she felt like

36:23.148 --> 36:26.733
someone was pushing it shut
so that she couldn't leave.

36:26.835 --> 36:29.936
It really, really scared her.

36:30.071 --> 36:31.204
You get a good look at him?

36:31.306 --> 36:33.406
I did. I had a sketch done.

36:33.508 --> 36:37.076
We could put a face to maybe
some of the problems here.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.115
He's a mean-looking guy.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.318
I can tell you that.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.220
Look at that.

36:50.775 --> 36:54.143
Wait a second. Take a look at this guy.

36:54.229 --> 36:56.629
Holy [bleep] take look at this.

36:56.765 --> 36:58.748
Take a look at this photo.

36:58.867 --> 37:01.184
Now take a look at this sketch.

37:01.269 --> 37:03.069
Oh, my God.

37:03.171 --> 37:04.737
- What do you think?
- Brows look very much alike.

37:04.839 --> 37:06.923
You can see the resemblance, the wide nose,

37:07.041 --> 37:10.276
the wide bridge nose.

37:10.378 --> 37:13.045
This guy scares the crap out of me.

37:24.950 --> 37:27.317
I had a sketch done.

37:27.419 --> 37:30.787
We can put a face to maybe
some of the problems here.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.794
He's a mean-looking guy.

37:37.879 --> 37:40.880
I can tell you that.

37:40.999 --> 37:44.617
Take a look at that.

37:44.703 --> 37:46.336
Wow.

37:46.421 --> 37:49.789
Wait a second. Take a look at this guy.

37:49.874 --> 37:52.275
Holy [bleep] look at this.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.344
Take a look at this photo.

37:54.429 --> 37:56.796
Now take a look at this sketch.

37:56.915 --> 37:58.715
Oh, my God.

37:58.817 --> 38:00.733
- What do you think?
- Brows look very much alike.

38:00.852 --> 38:02.602
You can see the resemblance, the wide nose,

38:02.687 --> 38:05.421
the wide bridge nose.

38:05.523 --> 38:09.392
This guy scares the crap out of me.

38:09.477 --> 38:11.561
The sketch looks just like Yarberry,

38:11.663 --> 38:12.862
the marshal who was hung.

38:12.947 --> 38:13.963
Yeah. Look.

38:16.751 --> 38:19.969
Look at the nose without the mustache.

38:21.122 --> 38:22.922
Oh, God. His eyes are...

38:23.041 --> 38:24.657
Right?

38:27.879 --> 38:30.313
Now, when I laid down the
photo of Yarberry earlier,

38:30.398 --> 38:31.948
did he look familiar to you?

38:32.033 --> 38:33.399
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

38:33.518 --> 38:35.752
Big time.

38:35.837 --> 38:37.954
Plus, the guy's a murder.
You said the guy was a mur...

38:38.089 --> 38:39.455
Yeah, he is a murderer.

38:39.541 --> 38:40.540
Died in his 30s.

38:40.625 --> 38:42.959
He's 34 when he gets hung.

38:43.044 --> 38:44.260
Now, I didn't mention this earlier

38:44.396 --> 38:46.095
because I didn't think it was important.

38:46.197 --> 38:48.531
But, um, you said the neck thing, right?

38:48.633 --> 38:49.666
There was some kind of neck
pain that you were feeling?

38:49.768 --> 38:50.667
Yes.

38:50.802 --> 38:52.885
Well, he was hung by his neck, right?

38:52.971 --> 38:55.071
Well, when they try to execute Yarberry,

38:55.156 --> 38:57.373
it went terribly wrong.

38:57.459 --> 39:00.443
They try to kill him using a
method called the jerk method.

39:00.528 --> 39:02.795
And what it was,
was a system of ropes and pulleys.

39:02.914 --> 39:04.180
And it failed.

39:04.265 --> 39:07.467
It wind up launching his
body into the wooden beam

39:07.552 --> 39:09.485
above the gallows and crushed his head.

39:11.606 --> 39:14.590
Now, the rope was pulled
so tightly around his neck

39:14.693 --> 39:16.192
they couldn't get it off.

39:16.261 --> 39:18.761
So they had to cut it but leave
the noose intact on his neck

39:18.897 --> 39:20.163
and buried him that way.
Oh, wow.

39:20.248 --> 39:24.734
And he was hung just down the block here.

39:28.473 --> 39:30.039
Well, Carla, now, we know why your kids

39:30.141 --> 39:32.108
are so scared to be here alone.

39:32.193 --> 39:35.695
But we haven't answered the big
question of can you stay here

39:35.780 --> 39:37.764
and still carry on your family tradition

39:37.849 --> 39:39.182
of having this restaurant

39:39.317 --> 39:42.251
and one day turn it over to your kids?

39:42.337 --> 39:44.837
Uh, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:48.059 --> 39:49.709
So what I would like you to do

39:49.794 --> 39:53.279
is get a medium who is
also a psychotherapist.

39:53.398 --> 39:54.914
That's your best bet.

39:54.999 --> 39:55.998
Okay.

39:56.134 --> 39:59.035
So the first day, when this person comes,

39:59.120 --> 40:02.288
I would like them to speak with her,

40:02.407 --> 40:05.074
basically giving her a session

40:05.210 --> 40:07.326
where she can talk about

40:07.412 --> 40:08.778
everything that went on in her life

40:08.880 --> 40:11.147
and kind of process it.

40:11.249 --> 40:13.116
The second day, I would like the person

40:13.201 --> 40:18.154
to come back and assist
in her being moved on.

40:18.239 --> 40:21.007
The third day, this person will come.

40:21.126 --> 40:24.360
And they will initially work
with the stabbing victim.

40:24.446 --> 40:26.679
They'll be giving that person a talking-to

40:26.798 --> 40:32.001
and then go ahead and move the murderer on.

40:32.086 --> 40:33.603
And on the fourth day,

40:33.705 --> 40:34.871
the person can come back

40:34.973 --> 40:38.808
and do a cleansing of the
building and the residual,

40:38.893 --> 40:42.779
um, paying specific attention to that,
uh, room.

40:44.699 --> 40:47.350
As long as you do all of these steps,

40:47.485 --> 40:50.319
it's a huge possibility that you'll be okay.

40:50.455 --> 40:52.655
You look a lot happier
than when I first met you.

40:52.757 --> 40:54.440
I'm super relieved.

40:54.526 --> 40:55.758
I entertained the thought

40:55.860 --> 40:58.594
that maybe we were having a group delusion.

41:00.865 --> 41:02.598
How do you feel now about
being able to tell your dad

41:02.700 --> 41:04.717
that, "Hopefully,
I can do this for another 40 years"?

41:04.836 --> 41:07.036
So relieved.

41:07.121 --> 41:08.588
He built many things along the way.

41:08.706 --> 41:10.339
But this is what remains.

41:10.425 --> 41:11.958
And this is the part that I honor.

41:12.076 --> 41:13.893
How does it feel to know that maybe,
one day,

41:13.978 --> 41:15.945
that your grandson and granddaughter

41:16.030 --> 41:18.364
may be running this place?

41:18.449 --> 41:19.832
I would really love that.

41:19.951 --> 41:23.452
I would feel complete in so many ways,
absolutely.
