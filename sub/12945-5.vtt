00:01.667 --> 00:04.000
Hey, honey,
how was school today?

00:04.066 --> 00:07.367
Oh, school was wonderful.
Did you guys have a good day?

00:07.800 --> 00:09.133
It was okay.

00:09.266 --> 00:10.633
Yeah, it was just fine.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.700
Oh, look, you're making
your famous stroganoff.

00:14.533 --> 00:16.533
Oh, it's my favorite. Mm.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.900
Are you in trouble or
do you want something?

00:19.467 --> 00:20.600
Uh, oh, um.

00:21.266 --> 00:23.133
I knew the stroganoff
was going too far.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.033
Last time, I tried
to feed it to the dog.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.100
And we don't even have a dog.

00:27.567 --> 00:29.633
Well, you know,
Mom, Dad, I'm...

00:29.934 --> 00:33.367
I-I'm 14 now and I have
a lot more needs.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.734
And I don't want to bug you
guys every single time

00:35.800 --> 00:39.867
that I need to buy something.
So, um, um...

00:40.867 --> 00:42.300
I-I want a raise
on my allowance.

00:43.066 --> 00:44.433
How can you argue with that?

00:44.867 --> 00:46.500
BOTH: No.

00:47.867 --> 00:49.166
I guess that's how.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.633
But, all of my friends
got raises.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.033
Give 'em the sad eyes.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.033
They can't say no
to the sad eyes.

00:57.467 --> 00:59.367
Oh, enough with the sad eyes.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.567
Listen, if there's something
you really need,

01:01.633 --> 01:03.233
just ask us
and we'll get it for you.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.667
You know,
that's just it, Dad.

01:04.734 --> 01:06.266
I don't wanna have
to ask anymore.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.300
I'm not a little kid.
I need freedom.

01:09.633 --> 01:11.934
Well, when you start
earning money of your own,

01:12.000 --> 01:13.433
then you can be
free with that,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.500
but until then, you have
to manage with your allowance

01:15.567 --> 01:16.734
the way that it is.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
Fine.

01:20.433 --> 01:21.433
[SIGHS]

01:22.433 --> 01:25.066
Yeah, well, your stroganoff
tastes like an old shoe.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.033
An old, smelly, burnt shoe.

about raising my allowance.

02:10.867 --> 02:13.300
Just like... just like that.
Like, "No."

02:13.367 --> 02:15.533
Well, did they say why?

02:15.600 --> 02:17.233
I think it's because
they want complete

02:17.300 --> 02:19.834
and total control over
my life forever.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.100
Not forever.
Just until you turn 18.

02:22.266 --> 02:23.533
You've got four years to go.

02:24.633 --> 02:25.767
Four more years?

02:26.133 --> 02:28.133
Don't I get time off
for good behavior?

02:28.433 --> 02:30.767
I just hate running to them
for every little thing.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.800
Lizzie, you could get a job.

02:33.867 --> 02:35.700
When I'm at the mall,
and I want a pair of jeans,

02:35.867 --> 02:37.000
I wanna buy them.

02:37.066 --> 02:38.300
Lizzie, you could get a job.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.133
I need independence

02:40.500 --> 02:42.266
No, they'll never
let me have that.

02:42.867 --> 02:44.367
Uh, Lizzie,
you could get a job.

02:45.467 --> 02:47.734

02:47.800 --> 02:49.066
I could get a job.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Were you saying
something, Miranda?

02:54.967 --> 02:58.200
Huh? Oh, no, I think
getting a job's a great idea.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.734
Uh, I think they're looking for
a new busboy.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.133
Oh.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.166
I can clear plates.
I do that at home for free.

03:08.066 --> 03:09.567
I could be the new busboy.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.567
Ooh. How do I look?

03:11.633 --> 03:12.767
Look like a busboy.

Okay.

Go get 'em.

a new busboy in town. [LAUGHS]

I start tomorrow.

we were all supposed

03:26.667 --> 03:27.767
to hang at
the mall tomorrow.

Oh, well, we can hang here instead.
It'll be fun.

to get you in trouble.

Oh, no,
I think it'll be fine.

03:34.533 --> 03:35.767
Plus, I think I can swing for

03:35.834 --> 03:37.433
some free drinks
for my friends.

something up with you?

I threw the ball.

something's wrong.

to be friends with me anymore.

She hasn't gotten you
in trouble for days.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.533
Exactly.

And Jared Ferguson has been

It doesn't take a genius
to put two and two together.

04:14.967 --> 04:17.266
Malina's moved on.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.233
You're better off
without her, man.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.700
It's just,
I don't understand girls.

04:22.066 --> 04:23.633
Nobody understands girls.

04:25.066 --> 04:26.867
Except maybe a girl.

04:27.867 --> 04:28.967
Talk to me.

04:29.367 --> 04:30.967
Maybe you need
to talk to a girl.

04:31.367 --> 04:32.934
But I don't know any.

Ew. Lizzie's not a girl.

Well, honey,

05:12.100 --> 05:13.533
talked to us
before getting a job.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.266
But now I don't have
to ask you guys for money

to raise my allowance.

I didn't stop working
the whole time I was there.

Uh, isn't that
the definition of a job?

think it'd be so much...

09:58.333 --> 09:59.767
Work?

09:59.834 --> 10:03.667
Yeah, but when payday comes around,
you'll be swimming in cash.

Oh, what? That's what
I would've done.

20:31.066 --> 20:32.533
No. I wasn't as polite as

20:32.600 --> 20:34.233
I should have been to
the customers.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.266
I think that qualifies for
the understatement of the year.

20:37.734 --> 20:39.100
It wasn't pretty.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.567
So, I take it the money train
has stopped rolling?

20:41.633 --> 20:42.967
Gordo, I don't think
that the money train

20:43.033 --> 20:44.266
ever took off
from the station.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.033
Besides,
if I'm always working,

20:46.100 --> 20:47.633
how am I gonna have time
to spend the money?

20:47.900 --> 20:49.000
Mm, good point.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.533
So, what's up with you guys?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.233
I feel like
I haven't seen you in days.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.333
What's been going on?

20:56.133 --> 20:58.000
Oh, nothing. N-nothing at all.

20:58.433 --> 20:59.467
Yes.

20:59.533 --> 21:00.767
Uh, you guys hungry?

21:02.533 --> 21:03.867
Keep it zipped.

21:04.033 --> 21:07.100
Ooh, cake. Hmm.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.300
Uh, milk?

21:12.867 --> 21:13.867
Yeah.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.133
Okay.

21:22.734 --> 21:24.633
Frosting's the best part.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
Ugh.

21:31.934 --> 21:33.667
You freak, you're trying
to scare me.

21:33.967 --> 21:36.100
And I haven't even had
time to br... Aah.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.967
And I haven't even had
time to...

21:39.800 --> 21:42.967
And I'm sure I can swing
for some free drinks for my friends.

21:43.033 --> 21:45.033
And that line just
really messed up.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.834

Mm-mm.
