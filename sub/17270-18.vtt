<i>STEPHEN: My name is Stephen Jameson.</i>

00:02.090 --> 00:03.756
<i>And I am one of the Tomorrow People.</i>

00:03.778 --> 00:05.941
<i>They call our powers the three T's.</i>

00:06.093 --> 00:07.526
<i>- Telepathy...
- CARA: Stephen?</i>

00:07.528 --> 00:08.626
<i>STEPHEN: Telekinesis...</i>

00:08.628 --> 00:09.928
<i>And teleportation.</i>

00:09.930 --> 00:12.931
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:12.933 --> 00:15.500
- No!
- ... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:15.502 --> 00:17.902
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:17.904 --> 00:19.637
<i>is to find my father.</i>

00:19.639 --> 00:22.674
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:23.943 --> 00:26.044
<i>STEPHEN: Previously on
The Tomorrow People...</i>

00:26.046 --> 00:28.446
The Founder invented some kind of machine

00:28.447 --> 00:30.143
to amplify your father's powers.

00:30.145 --> 00:31.849
- For what?
- I don't know.

00:31.911 --> 00:34.612
But whatever it is, your
father risked death to stop it.

00:34.614 --> 00:36.147
How do we stop the Founder?

00:36.149 --> 00:37.581
We kill him.

00:37.583 --> 00:39.851
The machine was your
father's dream, Stephen.

00:39.853 --> 00:43.621
A device that could finally
build a road to our salvation.

00:43.623 --> 00:44.622
(GUNSHOT)

00:50.062 --> 00:51.195
You're running?

00:51.197 --> 00:53.631
After Cassie died for us, for your plan?

00:53.633 --> 00:54.799
You're saving yourself now?

00:54.801 --> 00:56.467
I'm taking the only path I can.

01:04.575 --> 01:06.043
Hey, what the hell's going on?

01:06.045 --> 01:08.145
Boss just ordered all hands
on deck. No one knows why.

01:08.147 --> 01:11.382
- Jedikiah gave that order?
- I'm talking about our new boss.

01:15.086 --> 01:17.788
FOUNDER: All right, everyone. Listen up.

01:18.923 --> 01:22.893
The Ultra I founded was based on a vision.

01:22.895 --> 01:27.397
A world in which the Paranormal
would live not as a mutation,

01:27.399 --> 01:30.099
a freak of nature, but as a blessed being,

01:31.268 --> 01:34.537
graced with astonishing gifts.

01:34.539 --> 01:39.542
But as I became consumed by
the advancement of our kind,

01:39.544 --> 01:44.714
Dr. Jedikiah Price turned this place
of science into a fortress of brutality.

01:44.716 --> 01:46.182
A death factory.

01:47.184 --> 01:48.818
To my own ruin.

01:52.823 --> 01:54.090
And my daughter's.

02:02.833 --> 02:06.836
The Ultra that you have
come to know is no more!

02:06.838 --> 02:09.404
The hunting of our own kind, over.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.776
The imprisonment, the killing, through.

02:13.778 --> 02:18.114
From now on, all Paranormals
will live in peace.

02:18.116 --> 02:20.482
Breakouts will still be monitored,

02:20.484 --> 02:22.751
and those abusing their
powers will be detained

02:22.753 --> 02:24.986
and instructed in the need for discretion

02:24.988 --> 02:27.155
and then released.

02:29.992 --> 02:31.460
Any questions?

02:33.896 --> 02:34.929
Good.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.667
Back to work.

02:45.074 --> 02:48.977
Cassie's death was an accident,
John, it wasn't your fault.

02:48.979 --> 02:51.145
I pulled the trigger.

02:51.147 --> 02:53.881
I did the one thing I swear I'd never do.

02:53.883 --> 02:57.017
If anyone's to blame, it's the
Founder, he forced your hand.

02:58.953 --> 03:01.422
- He didn't force me to do anything.
- John.

03:02.691 --> 03:05.559
Please. Don't disappear
inside yourself again.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.596
For us to work,

03:09.831 --> 03:11.499
you have to let me in.

<i>STEPHEN: Cara, John, where are you guys?</i>

03:27.516 --> 03:29.049
Oh, good.

03:29.051 --> 03:30.717
A three-way.

03:30.719 --> 03:31.852
That's not funny.

03:33.121 --> 03:34.855
I know it's hard to believe him,

03:34.857 --> 03:36.656
maybe something just snapped in the guy.

03:36.658 --> 03:39.459
Losing his daughter, maybe
it jarred the Founder awake.

03:39.461 --> 03:41.661
It opened his eyes to
the dark side of Ultra.

03:41.663 --> 03:42.729
There's a light side?

03:42.731 --> 03:44.631
Sounds like there was once.

03:44.633 --> 03:45.999
Maybe it can happen again.

03:46.001 --> 03:48.902
Says the Founder. It
doesn't change anything.

03:48.904 --> 03:50.328
If what he says is true,

03:50.329 --> 03:52.486
you guys might not have
to live down here anymore.

03:52.491 --> 03:54.224
Hello, Tribeca.

03:54.226 --> 03:56.459
That is one hell of a big "If".

03:56.461 --> 03:58.195
Way to get a guy's hopes up.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.897
Look, think about it. The new
head of Ultra, he's one of us.

04:01.899 --> 04:05.801
With Jedikiah out of power,
Ultra can protect Paranormals.

04:05.803 --> 04:08.370
That's a little
convenient, don't you think?

04:08.372 --> 04:11.407
We get rid of our spies, our
generals, our foot soldiers?

04:11.409 --> 04:14.142
What, just wave the
white flag and surrender?

04:14.144 --> 04:18.414
Look, I'm not saying I trust the Founder

04:18.416 --> 04:20.216
but at least he's not Jedikiah.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.918
Where is our favorite
Paranormal exterminator?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.853
He's gone. Disappeared.

04:30.193 --> 04:32.060
How we doing today, folks?

04:32.062 --> 04:33.261
Hey, I'm doing great.

04:33.263 --> 04:35.196
Oh, it's a rhetorical question, pal.

04:35.198 --> 04:38.032
Welcome to New York City. No
one cares how you're doing.

04:38.034 --> 04:42.270
(LAUGHING) I'm kidding!
I'm only kidding. I care.

04:42.272 --> 04:44.171
I care that you tip me. Okay?

04:44.173 --> 04:47.074
Hey-yo! Alright, why don't you
step on out for me, friendly kid.

04:47.076 --> 04:51.112
You are my volunteer today. Big
hand for a friendly kid, folks.

04:51.114 --> 04:53.814
(CLAPPING) Yeah, so. I got a train to catch

04:53.816 --> 04:56.316
so what do you say we skip the
salad and cut to the main course.

04:56.318 --> 04:59.419
I call it the "disappearing act".

04:59.421 --> 05:02.089
Do me a favor, stand
right here, open your hand,

05:02.091 --> 05:04.091
prepare to be wowed, people.

05:04.093 --> 05:08.796
Okay, now, I want you to throw it
down as hard as you can, got it?

05:08.798 --> 05:10.131
SHY KID: Okay.

05:12.532 --> 05:15.268
(CROWD REACTING) How
on Earth did he do that?

05:15.270 --> 05:18.838
- Oh my god, I think I may be a genius.
- (CLAPPING)

05:18.840 --> 05:19.973
Encore.

05:21.508 --> 05:25.812
Give me a break, seriously.
How on Earth did he do that?

05:25.814 --> 05:30.116
I know, right? Monty the Magnificent,
folks! Thank you very much!

05:30.118 --> 05:32.851
Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.

05:36.956 --> 05:38.291
New breakout?

05:38.293 --> 05:39.792
Uh-huh. Come on.

05:39.794 --> 05:42.328
- Where are we going?
- To make a good first impression.

05:48.802 --> 05:51.804
Oh, there's no need to
knock. My door is always open.

05:56.109 --> 05:57.776
I'm offering you a seat.

05:58.978 --> 06:01.013
We have a breakout, sir.

06:01.015 --> 06:02.080
Bathory.

06:02.082 --> 06:03.182
Excuse me?

06:03.184 --> 06:06.018
It's what my friends call me.

06:06.020 --> 06:09.521
Right. Well, he is posing
as a street magician

06:09.523 --> 06:12.724
and using his powers
recklessly in front of humans.

06:12.726 --> 06:13.892
Uh-huh.

06:16.896 --> 06:19.998
Well, we just came here because we
wanted your permission to bring him in.

06:21.434 --> 06:23.100
(DEEP BREATH)

06:23.102 --> 06:26.170
Very well. As you see fit.

06:26.172 --> 06:27.205
Thank you, sir.

06:31.176 --> 06:33.044
Was there something else, Stephen?

06:34.412 --> 06:35.880
HILLARY: Jameson?

06:37.816 --> 06:39.250
I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

06:47.092 --> 06:50.193
Circled the block 14 times,
our magician's not here.

06:50.195 --> 06:52.762
This is where his
Tele-signature last registered.

06:52.764 --> 06:56.967
Well, maybe he got a cab or a train
or maybe his mom picked him up.

06:56.969 --> 06:59.402
He had no problem
teleporting in broad daylight,

06:59.404 --> 07:02.005
I hardly think he's going to
lay down some cash for a taxi.

07:02.007 --> 07:05.008
Wow. Look at you, a
real Paranormal profiler.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.977
We should get you a reality show.

07:06.979 --> 07:08.611
You have fun. I'm out.

07:08.613 --> 07:10.584
You've had your panties
in a bunch this whole day,

07:10.585 --> 07:11.440
what is your problem?

07:11.449 --> 07:13.315
You are my problem, Hillary.

07:13.317 --> 07:15.451
- What did I do?
- Just sucking up to the new boss.

07:15.453 --> 07:17.353
Always looking for the gold star, right?

07:17.355 --> 07:19.889
Is that what this is?
You think I'm all gung-ho?

07:19.891 --> 07:21.357
What else would it be?

07:21.359 --> 07:23.526
A second chance, maybe?

07:23.528 --> 07:27.062
We can finally do our jobs without feeling
like we're selling out our own kind.

07:27.064 --> 07:29.098
A pro-Paranormal Ultra sound great

07:29.100 --> 07:32.033
but I'd like to be sure that this
Bathory guy is for real, first.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.335
Okay, well, I guess we'll find
out when we bring in our breakout.

07:34.337 --> 07:36.471
- Guess so.
- But I trust him.

07:36.473 --> 07:38.006
(CHUCKLING)

07:38.088 --> 07:39.521
What, you think I'm being naive?

07:41.123 --> 07:42.390
Well, let's make a bet.

07:42.392 --> 07:44.459
I'm not betting on the fate of our species.

07:44.461 --> 07:47.161
Loser's the winner's bitch for
a week. You do whatever I say.

07:47.163 --> 07:48.229
Or you do whatever I say.

07:48.231 --> 07:49.397
Whatever.

07:49.399 --> 07:51.500
You're on. See you later, biatch.

07:54.103 --> 07:55.269

- www.addic7ed.com -

08:48.450 --> 08:51.819
STEPHEN: (SCOFFS) I was tracking a
Tele-signature, how did you do that?

08:51.821 --> 08:53.153
I designed these instruments

08:53.155 --> 08:55.755
so I can pretty much do
what I want with them.

08:55.757 --> 08:58.425
Hiding out in alleyways, not
really your style, Uncle Jed.

08:58.427 --> 09:00.894
Yeah, well, after you screwed
up that assassination attempt

09:00.896 --> 09:03.130
I've had to lay low until I
can figure out our next move.

09:03.132 --> 09:04.331
Sorry, "our next move"?

09:04.333 --> 09:05.332
Against the Founder.

09:06.935 --> 09:08.701
Stephen, he has to be stopped.

09:08.703 --> 09:11.121
From what? Shutting down the kill squads?

09:11.122 --> 09:14.007
- Putting an end to your violence?
- He's manipulating you, Stephen.

09:14.089 --> 09:17.891
And trust me, without me there to
protect you, he will eventually kill you.

09:17.893 --> 09:19.959
He had his chance. He didn't.

09:19.961 --> 09:22.029
Of course! Because he
wants to exploit you first.

09:22.031 --> 09:24.731
Your ability to stop time,
it's crucial to his plan.

09:24.733 --> 09:26.165
What plan?

09:26.167 --> 09:28.935
If you join forces with him,
millions of humans will die.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.174
The only human you ever
cared about was yourself.

09:35.176 --> 09:36.308
Good luck.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.348
Where have you been?

09:42.350 --> 09:44.316
Thought I had a beat on our
magician, the signal went cold.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.152
Well, I think I picked it up.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.191
"Monty the Magnificent.
Fort Greene Theatre".

09:53.226 --> 09:54.893
This is our guy?

09:54.895 --> 09:56.395
It's not exactly hiding.

09:58.062 --> 10:01.132
We're really going to go pick someone
up for putting on a magic show?

10:01.134 --> 10:04.235
Delivering a breakout is the only
way to see if the Founder's for real.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.474
HILLARY: Wanna get some beers?

10:10.476 --> 10:12.143
I'm sorry, I think I'm having a stroke.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.011
Did you suggest we break a rule?

10:14.013 --> 10:15.346
Very funny.

10:16.581 --> 10:18.848
<i>CARA: Stephen, can you hear me?</i>

10:18.850 --> 10:20.250
Did you feel that?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.018
I just got a telepathic burst.

10:22.020 --> 10:26.456
Yeah, me too. You check it
out upstairs. I'll wait here.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.124
Keep an eye out.

10:30.628 --> 10:33.062
<i>STEPHEN: Not a good time, Cara.</i>

10:33.064 --> 10:34.230
I was just...

10:34.232 --> 10:36.266
<i>STEPHEN: Worried about me? I'm fine.</i>

10:36.268 --> 10:38.501
I'll have two beers, whatever's on tap.

10:38.503 --> 10:40.503
You did try and kill your new boss.

10:40.505 --> 10:42.686
<i>STEPHEN: Yeah, and now
I'm bringing in a breakout,</i>

10:42.687 --> 10:43.487
as a way of saying I'm sorry.

10:43.508 --> 10:45.941
And you're willing to risk the
new breakout's life for that?

10:45.943 --> 10:47.942
Stephen, I got us a booth.

10:51.347 --> 10:52.581
Stephen?

10:53.883 --> 10:54.949
Stephen?

10:56.619 --> 10:58.019
Did he just hang up on me?

10:59.855 --> 11:01.523
Tim, triangulate Stephen's cell phone?

11:01.525 --> 11:03.225
Why are you stalking Stephen?

11:03.227 --> 11:04.459
To intercept the breakout.

11:04.461 --> 11:06.461
<i>TIM: He just entered Fort Greene Theatre,</i>

11:06.463 --> 11:09.231
where a magician calling
himself Monty the Magnificent

11:09.233 --> 11:11.567
<i>is providing the evening's entertainment.</i>

11:11.569 --> 11:14.435
- It's gotta be him.
- "Him" who?

11:14.437 --> 11:16.270
The new breakout. Let's go.

11:17.606 --> 11:19.107
I thought we were going out.

11:19.109 --> 11:20.842
We are. To a magic show.

11:22.878 --> 11:24.112
Come on, it'll be fun.

11:29.185 --> 11:30.418
Hey, Uncle Jed.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.020
Uh, is your mom here?

11:32.022 --> 11:34.388
Uh, no, she's not. Sorry.

11:34.460 --> 11:38.396
Oh, you're alone, interesting. Uh,
do you mind if I come in for a sec?

11:38.398 --> 11:42.133
Yeah, sure. I was just fixing a sandwich.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.567
Oh, that sounds tasty.

11:49.708 --> 11:53.110
What happened to grabbing Monty backstage?

11:53.112 --> 11:55.946
We should see the act,
document his Paranormal abuses

11:55.948 --> 11:57.981
and write a comprehensive report on him.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.183
I say we take him now.

12:03.555 --> 12:05.623
- Too late.
- MONTY: Thank you, thank you.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.090
There he is.

12:07.092 --> 12:08.526
(MONTY SPEAKING TO CROWD)

12:09.527 --> 12:11.295
With his partner.

12:11.297 --> 12:14.164
What, you think we can't take her?

12:14.166 --> 12:17.301
Let's just keep our heads down
until we know what they're planning

12:19.137 --> 12:21.071
(MONTY CONTINUES SPEAKING TO CROWD)

12:25.310 --> 12:27.510
We're blown.

12:27.512 --> 12:29.112
Better make the most of it.

12:33.517 --> 12:36.619
Cara Coburn, do you know her?

12:36.621 --> 12:38.121
Nope.

12:38.123 --> 12:39.356
Hey, Stephen.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.290
Hey! A little.

12:41.292 --> 12:42.392
Do you mind if we join you?

12:42.394 --> 12:44.227
Oh, uh, that's okay, we got a table.

12:44.229 --> 12:46.429
No, we don't mind the squeeze, do we?

12:47.531 --> 12:49.298
No.

12:49.300 --> 12:53.035
I heard this Monty guy's supposed
to be great. A real breakout star.

12:53.037 --> 12:55.304
(COUGHING) Excuse me, I'm
gonna go grab a napkin.

12:55.306 --> 12:56.339
Here, take mine.

12:56.341 --> 12:58.040
Thanks.

12:58.042 --> 13:00.643
You two make such a cute couple.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.846
How long have you been together?

13:02.848 --> 13:05.515
- Oh, um, we just work together.
- Oh, yeah, where?

13:07.317 --> 13:11.453
Come on, baby, it's Saturday
night. Who wants to talk work?

13:11.455 --> 13:13.889
I'm so sorry, I didn't get your name.

13:13.891 --> 13:17.325
(GASPING) Look, look! Wow, it's starting.

13:17.327 --> 13:18.560
You know.

13:19.962 --> 13:22.898
People tell me I'm crazy
to try this first trick.

13:26.035 --> 13:28.003
Might as well dress the part.

14:08.042 --> 14:09.943
How did he do that?

14:09.945 --> 14:12.946
- You know damn well!
- Time to go, people are watching.

14:16.918 --> 14:18.919
- Mr. Magnificent.
- Oh!

14:18.921 --> 14:21.087
Happy to sign autographs for my fans.

14:21.089 --> 14:23.222

(SIGHING)

14:52.387 --> 14:55.321
If we don't at least mix it up a little,
Hillary's gonna know something's off.

14:55.323 --> 14:57.555
I'm not gonna fight you over
some kid who thinks he's magic.

14:58.924 --> 15:01.193
Gotta protect my cover. Sorry, John.

15:06.099 --> 15:07.499

(GROANING)

15:42.200 --> 15:45.169
- Hey!
- Hi, what are you doing here?

15:45.171 --> 15:47.871
You texted me to come over.

15:47.873 --> 15:49.940
No, I didn't.

15:49.942 --> 15:51.641
Thank God.

15:51.643 --> 15:54.277
Look man, something is wrong with
Uncle Jed. He's talking crazy.

15:54.279 --> 15:57.347
Stephen, Astrid. Nice
of you to show up here.

15:57.349 --> 15:59.148
Go ahead, Luca, ask him.

16:00.616 --> 16:02.584
Ask me what?

16:02.586 --> 16:06.121
He says you have powers.

16:06.123 --> 16:08.924
Like comic book stuff.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.992
And he says you know about it, Astrid.

16:13.163 --> 16:17.332
Look, Jedikiah is very sick.
And he was just leaving.

16:17.334 --> 16:19.234
Astrid, are you going to tell him?

16:22.072 --> 16:24.173
Your brother is right, your uncle is sick.

16:27.043 --> 16:29.111
Really?

16:29.113 --> 16:30.812
Really?

16:30.914 --> 16:33.113
You've seen firsthand the
dangers of knowing too much.

16:33.115 --> 16:35.216
I've just told Luca everything.

16:35.218 --> 16:37.418
Now, tell him what's in store
for him, tell him his future.

16:37.420 --> 16:39.587
That kill squad that came
after you, tell him about it!

16:39.589 --> 16:40.721
Tell him!

16:40.723 --> 16:42.223
Why are you doing this?

16:42.225 --> 16:45.326
Folks, this is a Paranormal intervention.

16:45.328 --> 16:49.063
I brought you into Ultra to protect
you and you fall in with the wrong guy.

16:49.065 --> 16:50.964
You think it's easy to dismiss what I say?

16:50.966 --> 16:53.334
What are you gonna do now that
your brother's life is on the line?

16:53.336 --> 16:55.570
- Get out!
- Tell him the truth! Now!

16:57.206 --> 17:00.374
Do it or, so help me god,
I will put a bullet in him.

17:00.376 --> 17:01.641
- What the hell?
- Do it!

17:01.868 --> 17:03.201
Let him go!

17:03.203 --> 17:04.903
Tell him now.

17:04.905 --> 17:06.771
Okay, okay, okay!

17:06.772 --> 17:09.241
Luca, it's all true.

17:09.242 --> 17:10.875
Yeah, not convincing enough.

(STEPHEN YELLING)

17:26.866 --> 17:28.799
Thank you for proving my point.

17:31.236 --> 17:32.736
You son of a bitch!

17:32.738 --> 17:34.872
He needs to know the
truth. Please, listen to me!

17:34.874 --> 17:36.173
So it's true.

17:38.343 --> 17:40.277
You're some kind of mutant?

17:40.279 --> 17:41.379
No, no...

17:41.381 --> 17:43.214
And Mom and Dad?

17:43.216 --> 17:48.052
I know our family was messed up.
We're like a supernatural freak show.

17:48.054 --> 17:50.054
And everyone knew about it except me!

17:50.056 --> 17:52.756
I was only trying to
protect you. Okay? I promise.

17:52.758 --> 17:56.026
Well, what about me? Am I a freak too?

17:56.028 --> 17:57.127
No.

18:03.735 --> 18:08.071
I'm sorry to have to do that, Stephen.
But the time for secrets is past.

18:08.073 --> 18:10.407
Everyone you love needs to know the stakes.

18:10.409 --> 18:12.208
Listen to me, the
Founder cannot be trust...

18:23.355 --> 18:24.320
(GRUNTS)

18:25.890 --> 18:27.356
I did it for your own good. Stephen!

18:27.358 --> 18:29.291
My family was off-limits.

18:31.728 --> 18:33.829
Wait, Stephen. Listen to me!

18:36.700 --> 18:40.002
We're done talking. Let's
see who passes out first.

18:40.004 --> 18:42.137

18:42.139 --> 18:43.372
(HIGH PITCHED RINGING)

(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

18:48.478 --> 18:52.081
Stay the hell out of my life or
I will find a way to kill you.

18:59.722 --> 19:00.822
- So what was that about?
- What?

19:00.824 --> 19:02.356
I was trying to save a breakout.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.392
At the expense of Stephen's cover?

19:04.394 --> 19:08.296
Well, it doesn't matter now since the Founder
is ushering in a kinder, gentler Ultra.

19:08.298 --> 19:11.733
- But you don't believe that.
- Stephen does.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.935
And he's willing to risk
Monty's life to prove it.

19:13.937 --> 19:16.771
And you're willing to risk
Stephen's life to prove him wrong.

19:16.773 --> 19:19.240
He's been under cover too long.
He's starting to think like Ultra.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.175
I think he might be right.

19:21.177 --> 19:23.912
About a man that tortured you?

19:23.914 --> 19:26.214
Used his own child as a human guinea pig

19:26.216 --> 19:28.316
and then threw her away
when he was done with her?

19:28.318 --> 19:30.051
That's the man you think we should trust?

19:30.053 --> 19:32.053
You didn't see what we saw.

19:32.055 --> 19:34.822
His daughter died in
his arms because of me.

19:34.824 --> 19:37.125
He could've done anything to us.

19:37.127 --> 19:39.760
But he didn't, he let us go.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.029
And the only way Cassie's
death will have meant something

19:42.031 --> 19:43.998
is if the Founder is true to his word.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.969
So you're telling me
everyone down here is like me?

19:50.105 --> 19:52.140
You're all magic?

19:52.142 --> 19:54.375
Not saying you're not special, Monty.

19:54.377 --> 19:57.445
Just saying some of us
are a little more special.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.647
Don't listen to him. Down
here, we're all equal.

20:03.818 --> 20:05.286
Ladies and gentlemen.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.688
Presenting Monty the Mediocre.

20:18.832 --> 20:20.200
Excuse me. Sir.

20:21.769 --> 20:24.337
Just four letters.

20:24.339 --> 20:26.086
Four simple building blocks.

20:26.687 --> 20:28.917
It seems like there should be
more to us than that, some...

20:29.311 --> 20:33.012
ineffable thing that
makes us unique. But...

20:33.014 --> 20:36.716
We're all simply the sum
of these four components.

20:36.718 --> 20:39.152
G, T, A, C.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.888
Yeah, DNA. Uh, if this is a bad time, I...

20:41.890 --> 20:44.157
But this particular DNA is my daughter's.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.528
For so long, I... I searched
through it, looking for the key

20:49.530 --> 20:53.199
that could save us from the threat
of humans and their petty fears.

20:54.835 --> 20:57.536
But in the process, I...

20:57.538 --> 20:59.738
I sacrificed the part of her

21:01.107 --> 21:02.274
that was unique.

21:03.810 --> 21:06.212
And now, all I have are these four letters.

21:08.348 --> 21:11.750
(SIGHING) I'm sorry, Stephen, you, uh...

21:11.752 --> 21:13.785
you wanted to talk?

21:13.787 --> 21:16.988
The, um, breakout, we lost him.

21:16.990 --> 21:19.858
We didn't lose him. The
Tomorrow People took him.

21:20.927 --> 21:22.928
Which is why we have to put an end to them.

21:22.930 --> 21:24.730
Stephen, I know that you have ties to them.

21:24.732 --> 21:25.931
Excuse me?

21:25.933 --> 21:27.933
I need you to take them a message.

21:27.935 --> 21:29.268
Who said that I have ties to them?

21:29.270 --> 21:32.337
Tell them to release the
breakout and in exchange

21:32.339 --> 21:34.206
I am prepared to offer them a truce.

21:35.441 --> 21:38.110
If our kind is to survive
it must be in peace.

21:38.112 --> 21:41.813
Otherwise, my daughter's death
will have been for nothing.

21:43.983 --> 21:45.217
Please, Stephen.

21:47.453 --> 21:48.954
I'll see what I can do.

21:52.458 --> 21:53.892
(LAUGHING)

21:54.961 --> 21:56.962
This kid's actually pretty good.

21:56.964 --> 21:58.630
Monty, you're coming with me.

21:58.632 --> 21:59.485
No, Stephen, I said no.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.862
He's trying to get you
to risk your life for him.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.523
You don't have to live down here anymore,

22:02.524 --> 22:03.634
you can go back to the life you had.

22:03.803 --> 22:06.070
- More or less.
- Yeah, the less being they take your powers

22:06.072 --> 22:07.805
and you go back to
being like everyone else.

22:07.807 --> 22:11.075
If I stay down here, even with
powers I'm like everyone else.

22:11.077 --> 22:13.176
Dude, don't get all existential.

22:13.178 --> 22:15.044
Why would you trust the
Founder to keep his word?

22:15.046 --> 22:17.180
He has no reason to lie to me.

22:17.182 --> 22:19.383
He knows I'm helping you, he
still turned the other cheek.

22:19.385 --> 22:22.185
While they fight, why don't
you show me another trick.

22:22.187 --> 22:24.454
Okay. You ready?

22:24.456 --> 22:26.890
Or he's trying to lure you
into a false sense of security.

22:26.892 --> 22:28.258
Did you even consider that?

22:28.260 --> 22:29.926
Now you see me.

22:29.928 --> 22:31.295
(WHOOSHING)

22:31.297 --> 22:32.396
Haha!

22:33.898 --> 22:37.434
This is what we're missing! Showmanship.

22:37.436 --> 22:39.670
He just teleported topside.

22:39.672 --> 22:41.271
- STEPHEN: Real smart, bud.
- Yeah.

22:41.273 --> 22:44.006
About as smart as you hooking
up with your partner on the job.

22:45.275 --> 22:46.409
What was that?

22:47.944 --> 22:50.780
I'm not blind. You're
18 and she's gorgeous.

22:50.782 --> 22:53.182
I don't know how we expected
you to remain objective.

22:55.051 --> 22:57.219
Wow, are you jealous?

22:57.221 --> 22:58.554
Of course not.

22:58.556 --> 23:01.023
How can you be jealous of
Hillary when you're with John?

23:01.025 --> 23:04.259
This isn't about me and John, this
is about you risking Monty's life.

23:04.261 --> 23:06.696
- Hillary is clouding your judgment.
- You are unbelievable.

23:06.698 --> 23:09.264
- You said you and I were a mistake.
- We are a mistake.

23:09.266 --> 23:11.033
And what about Hillary?
She's a mistake too?

23:11.035 --> 23:12.301
She's an Ultra agent.

23:14.371 --> 23:16.004
You know that's not the reason.

23:17.708 --> 23:21.076
Come on, Cara. Don't
make me read your mind.

23:21.078 --> 23:23.745
Just because I'm jealous,
doesn't mean I'm wrong.

23:23.747 --> 23:25.947
At least I can keep my feelings
and my judgment separate.

23:25.949 --> 23:27.849
Yeah, you've done a great job with that.

23:29.685 --> 23:31.586
Stephen.

23:31.588 --> 23:33.113
If you have lost sight

23:33.124 --> 23:35.857
of why you've gone undercover
in Ultra in the first place,

23:36.326 --> 23:38.860
it's more than just my
feelings that'll get hurt.

23:49.167 --> 23:52.569
White makes the first
move, last time I checked.

23:52.571 --> 23:54.438
Sorry, zoning off a little.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.840
<i>TIM: Is that slang for being
preoccupied with one's sexual mate?</i>

23:57.842 --> 24:00.676
Tim. Mind your own business. Pawn E4.

<i>TIM: Pawn to E5.</i>

24:05.283 --> 24:07.516
Well, aren't we feeling bold?

certainly wasn't my move.</i>

24:19.597 --> 24:21.730
What?

24:21.732 --> 24:24.666
<i>TIM: Someone's entered my mainframe
and is playing you remotely.</i>

24:24.668 --> 24:27.869
Clearly, your opponent knows a
great deal about my operating system.

24:31.207 --> 24:33.441
Maybe that's because he designed it.

24:38.881 --> 24:41.829
Luca, stop avoiding my
calls, I need to talk to you.

24:41.830 --> 24:43.708
Okay? Call me back. Please.

24:44.854 --> 24:46.221
Hey, hey.

24:46.223 --> 24:47.856
I need your help.

24:47.858 --> 24:48.957
What?

24:48.959 --> 24:51.426
I can't find my little brother.

24:51.428 --> 24:53.629
- What do you want me to do?
- I'm gonna keep looking for him,

24:53.631 --> 24:55.796
I need you to put his
photo in facial recognition.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.333
To see if we're already tracking
him, his name is Luca Jameson.

25:06.609 --> 25:08.543
You think the TAC team is about him?

25:08.545 --> 25:11.146
I hope not. But Luca knows about me.

25:11.148 --> 25:13.681
And you remember what happened to
Astrid when somebody ratted her out.

25:16.552 --> 25:17.718
I'll see what I can do.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.120
Ok. Thank you.

25:20.689 --> 25:22.157
(GUNS BEING LOADED)

25:26.194 --> 25:28.228
Didn't expect to see us arming up.

25:28.230 --> 25:31.831
Well it seems the breakout you and your
partner failed to apprehend has been located.

25:31.833 --> 25:34.201
No offense, this doesn't
exactly look like a truce.

25:34.203 --> 25:35.802
This breakout has proven evasive,

25:35.804 --> 25:40.174
and as much as I loathe force, it
will still be necessary on occasion.

25:40.176 --> 25:43.277
The kid is a street magician.
What are you going to do to him?

25:43.279 --> 25:44.645
That's up to him.

25:56.256 --> 25:58.624
JEDIKIAH: I see you got my message.

25:58.626 --> 26:01.894
Who else would be reckless enough
break Sicilian and rush a knight?

26:03.597 --> 26:07.166
John, you know I've never subscribed
to the historical defenses.

26:08.335 --> 26:10.368
Always better to sacrifice a pawn...

26:10.370 --> 26:14.506
And draw a prey for the bigger guns.

26:14.508 --> 26:17.542
Yes, you taught me that the first
time you brought me here to play.

26:19.312 --> 26:20.312
I did.

26:21.547 --> 26:24.216
- Alright, let's cut the crap, kid.
- Let's.

26:24.218 --> 26:25.417
I need you.

26:26.652 --> 26:29.454
Let me rephrase that, humanity needs you.

26:29.456 --> 26:31.389
Always in the name of humanity.

26:31.391 --> 26:33.758
I'm running out of allies, John.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.525
If you walk away from me now,

26:35.526 --> 26:39.065
every human being on this
island is in grave danger.

26:39.532 --> 26:42.666
Even if I did believe
you, how is it my problem?

26:44.803 --> 26:47.271
I know you feel responsible
for what happened to Cassie.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.539
We're not going to talk about Cassie.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.274
You're right, we're not.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.610
But I'm offering you a
chance to atone for her death.

26:54.546 --> 26:56.447
Who do you want me to kill for you now?

26:56.449 --> 26:59.316
I don't want you to kill anyone.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.719
I want you to save someone, John.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.520
Someone very dear to both of us.

27:42.593 --> 27:44.261
(GUNS COCKING)

27:44.263 --> 27:47.129
Everyone! Please disembark immediately.

27:52.135 --> 27:54.837
Monty. Just come in the easy way

27:54.839 --> 27:56.406
and you won't get hurt.

28:00.877 --> 28:02.679
Try and get out of these ones, Houdini.

28:15.016 --> 28:17.416
You want me to save Roger?

28:17.418 --> 28:20.819
It is rather poetic, if I do say so myself.

28:20.821 --> 28:23.922
You getting to save the life
of the man I killed? Beautiful.

28:23.924 --> 28:27.759
This is all predicated upon
Stephen's participation.

28:27.761 --> 28:30.929
And at the moment, he's convinced
the Founder is on his side.

28:30.931 --> 28:35.000
If he's not dissuaded of
this, John, Stephen will die.

28:35.002 --> 28:37.569
Roger will die. I will die.

28:37.571 --> 28:39.638
You and all the Tomorrow People...

28:39.640 --> 28:42.973
Will die? The Founder
wins, the whole world ends?

28:42.975 --> 28:44.474
How horrible.

28:44.476 --> 28:46.010
You're being facetious.

28:46.012 --> 28:48.746
JOHN: The Founder forgave
me for killing his daughter.

28:48.748 --> 28:50.731
If he wanted us dead, he
could have done it by now.

28:50.732 --> 28:52.000
He would've done it by now.

28:52.018 --> 28:53.984
John, he's playing you,
he's playing everybody.

28:53.986 --> 28:57.621
- For what?
- For the plan Roger chose death to stop.

28:57.623 --> 28:58.689
Look.

28:59.758 --> 29:01.825
You want your leader back?

29:01.827 --> 29:05.062
I have his body, I have
the means to bring him back.

29:05.064 --> 29:09.298
Unless, of course, you want to bet
with the Founder, in which case...

29:12.803 --> 29:14.037
Checkmate.

29:17.041 --> 29:19.008
Hmm.

29:19.010 --> 29:21.778
If you're lying, I will
put a bullet in you.

29:25.515 --> 29:27.316
(PANICKED BREATHING)

29:28.518 --> 29:29.953
(GROANING)

29:29.955 --> 29:32.889
Let me go. Please!

29:32.891 --> 29:35.057
You want me to stop performing? I'll stop.

29:35.059 --> 29:38.461
(DEEP BREATH) All my mom wants
is for me to go to dental school.

29:38.463 --> 29:40.662
I'll never use my powers again. I swear.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.800
You said the new Ultra's
was gonna be different.

29:44.802 --> 29:47.603
That we weren't taking
down our own kind anymore.

29:47.605 --> 29:50.038
You are just like my
uncle, nothing's changed.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.409
I never said Ultra would
tolerate reckless Paranormals

29:53.411 --> 29:56.778
revealing our powers to the world
on a whim, or worse, for profit.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.581
Don't.

29:59.583 --> 30:01.516
No! No, please.

30:01.518 --> 30:06.488
You perform parlor tricks for humans,
you allow them to record our antics

30:06.490 --> 30:09.591
and broadcast them across the globe.

30:09.593 --> 30:11.927
- Do you think that's wise?
- I, um...

30:13.529 --> 30:15.631
I'm just a magician.

30:15.633 --> 30:16.665
Ah!

30:18.601 --> 30:20.034
(GRUNTING)

30:20.036 --> 30:22.003
And what's the first rule of magic?

30:27.408 --> 30:29.944
Never reveal your secret.

30:29.946 --> 30:31.578
Now, do you think you can do that?

30:31.580 --> 30:34.915
Do you think, uh, you can
keep our little secret?

30:37.452 --> 30:39.553
Uh-huh. Yeah.

30:39.555 --> 30:41.088
Hmm, well, good.

30:41.090 --> 30:44.157
I look forward to catching
your show some time.

30:44.159 --> 30:46.893
Just try to keep the
tricks somewhat plausible.

30:47.962 --> 30:49.529
Yeah.

30:49.531 --> 30:52.666
Absolutely, uh-huh. You... you got it.

30:52.668 --> 30:54.167
Mister, um...

30:54.169 --> 30:56.036
Mr. Bathory.

30:56.038 --> 30:59.472
And that name is definitely
to be kept secret.

30:59.474 --> 31:00.740
Of course.

31:03.943 --> 31:06.478
(DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)

31:09.482 --> 31:12.084
What was in the needle?
What did you just do to him?

31:12.086 --> 31:16.354
I told you things would be
different here at Ultra, Stephen.

31:16.356 --> 31:18.757
In the future, you'd do well to trust me.

31:56.562 --> 31:58.597
What the hell have you done to him?

31:59.599 --> 32:02.033
It's the only way I can save him, John.

32:03.068 --> 32:06.904
To bring him back, I need Stephen.

32:06.906 --> 32:09.983
I have tried everything,
but he will not listen to me.

32:09.984 --> 32:11.390
He will listen to you.

32:13.145 --> 32:14.864
If what you're saying is true,

32:14.865 --> 32:17.713
if Roger put himself into
limbo to stop the Founder,

32:18.384 --> 32:21.786
you say bringing him back doesn't
play straight into his plans?

32:21.788 --> 32:24.822
It's a risk we're going to have to take.

32:24.824 --> 32:28.492
You expect... you expect me
to convince Stephen of that?

32:29.628 --> 32:31.896
You or Cara.

32:31.898 --> 32:34.098
I understand she has
quite a sway over the boy.

32:38.837 --> 32:40.471
(EXHALING)

32:40.473 --> 32:41.739
You're crazy.

32:44.709 --> 32:46.778
(SOFTLY) I knew I could count on you, kid.

32:55.519 --> 32:57.587
Hey. How'd you find him?

32:57.589 --> 32:59.990
I didn't, uh, the lady
from your office did.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.927
Lady from my office?

33:03.929 --> 33:07.463
Oh, uh, short, kinda chesty.

33:07.465 --> 33:10.400
Yeah, uh, she... she came by my house,

33:10.402 --> 33:12.402
told me Luca had been
hiding out in the library.

33:12.404 --> 33:13.636
That was my partner, Hillary.

33:13.638 --> 33:15.839
Hillary?

33:15.841 --> 33:18.408
- Hillary who tried to have me killed?
- Sorry.

33:21.112 --> 33:22.979
I'll let you two talk. Ok.

33:22.981 --> 33:24.847
Hey.

33:24.849 --> 33:27.082
Gimme a sec.

33:27.084 --> 33:28.017
Hey.

33:29.653 --> 33:31.654
Look, I know you're freaked out.

33:31.656 --> 33:34.657
Not telling you the truth, it was
only ever about protecting you.

33:34.659 --> 33:36.125
Okay? You gotta believe me.

33:36.127 --> 33:40.363
I'm 16. Man, I'm your brother.
I don't need to be protected.

33:40.365 --> 33:42.332
I know.

33:42.334 --> 33:44.894
Alright? I just didn't want
to pull you into this world.

33:44.895 --> 33:46.143
This is my burden.

33:46.604 --> 33:48.538
- Not yours.
- Yeah?

33:48.540 --> 33:51.374
Well, our whackjob uncle said
it could happen to me too.

33:51.376 --> 33:53.976
Okay, but, it doesn't mean it will.

33:53.978 --> 33:56.846
And if it does, we will
figure something out.

33:56.848 --> 33:58.147
Alright? I'm your brother, I'm always...

33:58.149 --> 33:59.982
I gotta go to practice.

34:07.924 --> 34:10.692
(WHOOSHING)

34:10.694 --> 34:13.594
Would it kill you to knock,
like a normal human being?

34:13.597 --> 34:14.929
Well, I'm not human.

34:14.931 --> 34:17.132
The Founder wants to see
you. (CLEARING THROAT)

34:17.134 --> 34:20.101
Okay. Great. I'll put my pants back on.

34:20.103 --> 34:21.871
Mmm-mmm.

34:21.873 --> 34:25.474
See, I won the bet, and
I found your brother, so...

34:25.476 --> 34:27.076
(EXCLAIMING) So...

34:28.811 --> 34:30.512
You have to do whatever I want.

34:35.385 --> 34:36.717
You serious?

34:36.719 --> 34:39.020
Mmm-hmm. Bet's a bet, Jameson.

34:39.022 --> 34:41.054
(CHUCKLING) What about the Founder?

34:45.127 --> 34:46.594
It can wait.

35:15.522 --> 35:17.523
JOHN: We need to find Stephen now.

35:17.525 --> 35:19.291
Why? What did Jedikiah say?

35:19.293 --> 35:20.085
He's got Roger's body.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.309
I saw him, Cara! I saw
him with my own eyes.

35:23.463 --> 35:25.430
With Stephen's help, we can bring him back.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.301
Then we should split up.

35:33.539 --> 35:35.406
I'll let you know if I find him.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.016
Stephen, are you here?

35:47.419 --> 35:49.988
<i>(THINKING) We need to talk,
your uncle, he claims...</i>

36:09.174 --> 36:10.374
What is it?

36:12.811 --> 36:14.111
We're gonna make it.

36:18.183 --> 36:21.552
Checked his school and
Ultra, he's not there.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.853
I found him.

36:24.389 --> 36:25.489
Is he okay?

36:29.126 --> 36:30.460
Cara, what's going on?

36:33.565 --> 36:35.365
I think we may be losing him.

36:45.976 --> 36:46.878
You wanted to see me?

36:46.930 --> 36:49.764
Um, where is everyone?

36:49.766 --> 36:54.236
I gave them the night off, I
wanted to talk to you in private.

36:54.238 --> 36:56.037
Okay.

36:56.039 --> 36:59.273
Relax, I know you've come up the
ranks under a reign of terror.

36:59.275 --> 37:03.277
The notion of injecting a breakout
with a tracer and releasing him,

37:03.279 --> 37:05.312
must seem unbelievable.

37:05.314 --> 37:08.315
- A tracer.
- It's a tracking device, actually.

37:08.317 --> 37:12.586
Lodges in the cerebellum and sends a
radio wave that my network monitors.

37:14.489 --> 37:18.625
- Can I trust you with another secret, Stephen?
- Sure.

37:18.627 --> 37:22.629
While your uncle was busy
stripping our kind of their powers,

37:22.631 --> 37:25.532
I was operating my own pet program.

37:25.534 --> 37:27.501
Yeah, what is all this?

37:27.503 --> 37:32.105
Each dot represents a Paranormal
tagged and released over the years.

37:32.107 --> 37:36.543
Many by Ultra, before
Jedikiah's paranoia set in.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.078
There are over 200 in the city alone.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.214
STEPHEN: What are you planning
on doing with all of them?

37:42.349 --> 37:44.684
Well, it's not what I plan on doing.

37:44.686 --> 37:46.319
It's what you are going to do.

37:47.321 --> 37:49.222
You, Stephen,

37:49.224 --> 37:53.192
will lead them all, someday,
to a place known as The Refuge.

37:56.330 --> 38:00.166
You must wonder how I lost sight of
the horrors happening under my own nose.

38:00.168 --> 38:02.601
Even committing some of
them against my own blood.

38:04.738 --> 38:07.273
The answer, Stephen...

38:07.275 --> 38:08.308
is this.

38:11.545 --> 38:13.246
The machine.

38:13.248 --> 38:14.680
I thought my father destroyed it.

38:14.682 --> 38:17.317
Your father built the original.

38:17.319 --> 38:20.019
He was to serve as it's, uh...

38:20.021 --> 38:23.722
How can I describe it? It's... engine.

38:23.724 --> 38:25.290
To do what?

38:25.292 --> 38:27.092
Amplify his powers.

38:27.094 --> 38:31.330
In theory, enough to bring
all Paranormals there with him.

38:31.332 --> 38:33.466
If that was true, why
would he want to blow it up?

38:33.468 --> 38:36.168
Indeed. Indeed, finding The Refuge

38:36.170 --> 38:38.504
is in the best interest of both species.

38:38.506 --> 38:43.408
Homo sapiens and Homo superiors
cannot coexist in peace.

38:43.410 --> 38:47.145
But your uncle poisoned your father's
mind, he turned him against me.

38:47.147 --> 38:48.581
Why would Jedikiah do that?

38:48.583 --> 38:51.749
Simple. Your uncle doesn't
want this war to end

38:51.751 --> 38:53.985
because without it, he's nothing.

38:55.153 --> 38:57.288
You don't know whether you can trust me.

38:57.290 --> 38:59.123
Jedikiah's poisoned your mind too.

38:59.125 --> 39:03.027
But you are the only one who
can take us to The Refuge.

39:03.029 --> 39:07.198
After years of toiling, I
have finally rebuilt the Ark

39:07.200 --> 39:09.734
that will sail us to our destiny.

39:09.736 --> 39:12.937
But we must launch before
your uncle interferes.

39:16.942 --> 39:17.976
Okay.

39:19.244 --> 39:21.211
What do you want me to do?

39:21.213 --> 39:25.448
A test run. To see if you can
do what my Cassie could not.

39:25.450 --> 39:29.586
You see, the machine uses your power
to stop time and to open the portal.

39:33.558 --> 39:34.625
Alright.

39:56.313 --> 39:57.414
Godspeed.

40:03.354 --> 40:05.088
(ARK POWERING UP)

40:11.428 --> 40:12.695
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

40:28.411 --> 40:29.645
(BEEPING)

40:48.631 --> 40:49.598
Stephen.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.400
Is this you?

40:52.402 --> 40:53.468
Dad.

40:55.537 --> 40:57.572
What are you doing here?

40:57.574 --> 40:58.640
I'm just...

41:00.542 --> 41:02.309
watching you and Luca play.

41:07.348 --> 41:09.182
Dad, listen.

41:09.184 --> 41:11.151
It's not me anymore.

41:11.153 --> 41:12.452
Ok? I'm right here.

41:15.690 --> 41:18.659
- You're not dead?
- No.

41:18.661 --> 41:22.129
No, I'm very much alive. My
body's just back in the real world.

41:22.131 --> 41:25.565
- Ok, the Founder, he has this machine.
- Machine?

41:25.567 --> 41:28.335
Stephen. You have to
listen to me very carefully.

41:28.337 --> 41:31.238
Wait. Dad! Dad, I can't hold on any longer.

41:33.674 --> 41:34.707
Dad.

41:40.414 --> 41:43.082
(BEEPING VERY FAST)

41:43.084 --> 41:46.186
Oh, you stupid, stupid boy.
