00:38.440 --> 00:39.920
<i>I hate early mornings.</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:42.840
Technically speaking,
it isn't morning yet.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.320
The sun rises in one minute precisely.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.640
Point is, why are we awake before the sun?

00:47.720 --> 00:51.520
Because I am in charge
of the school today, Beatrice Bunch.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
That's why.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.920
But, Miss Hardbroom, where's Miss Cackle?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.960
Lessons will commence
one hour earlier than usual.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.480
Everyone dressed and then outside
for a 20-minute run before breakfast.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.560
What's the point of a witch running
when we've got broomsticks to get around?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.640
A fit witch makes a better witch, Ethel.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.480
Almost there girls.
Breakfast is waiting.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.640
Miss Drill, do you know
why Miss Cackle's not here?

01:22.720 --> 01:24.320
I know as much as you, Mildred.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.960
Smoked fish.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.000
Brain food, apparently.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.160
Miss Hardbroom has asked me
to supervise this lot.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.720
Emergency staff meeting for you
in five minutes.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.760
Oh, really?
Well, in that case...

01:41.880 --> 01:43.240
What's the emergency?

01:44.280 --> 01:46.920
Has it got something to do
with Miss Cackle not being here?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.800
I don't know.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.680
- I'll go and find out.
- Go.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.800
I know it is unusually early
for a staff meeting,

02:13.880 --> 02:17.040
but I have a serious matter
to discuss with you this morning.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.680
It concerns Miss Cackle.

02:20.520 --> 02:25.160
The Great Wizard has summoned her
to appear before the Magic Council today.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.400
<i>Aperi portum.</i>

02:35.080 --> 02:37.520
<i>- </i><i> A disciplinary hearing?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

02:38.560 --> 02:40.320
That's awful. Poor Miss Cackle.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.400
Uh, what does that mean,
exactly?

02:43.720 --> 02:47.040
It means that Miss Cackle's position
at the school is in jeopardy.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.640
After today,

02:49.800 --> 02:52.360
she may no longer be our headmistress.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.720
No.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.440
There's more, I'm afraid.

02:58.200 --> 03:03.240
Alongside this inquiry into Miss Cackle,
the council, in their wisdom...

03:10.640 --> 03:12.120
Mildred Hubble.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.560
Hello, Miss Hardbroom.
I was just about to knock.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.040
I literally just got here.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.080
This second. Right now.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.600
What do you want?

03:21.160 --> 03:24.040
Smoked fish for breakfast.
Every day. We love it.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.040
Ask Miss Tapioca, not me. Go.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.520
Go.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.720
Alongside the investigation
into Miss Cackle,

03:38.800 --> 03:40.880
the council wish to take a look
at the school.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.240
What for?

03:42.320 --> 03:45.320
To see if it is safe and fit for purpose.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.680
- They are sending an inspector.
- When's that?

03:48.760 --> 03:52.600
Three hours,
five minutes' time precisely.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.160
Therefore, in Miss Cackle's absence,

03:57.480 --> 04:00.480
it is imperative
that when Miss Doomstone arrives...

04:00.560 --> 04:02.640
- I thought she'd retired.
- Miss Doomstone?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
You know her?

04:04.200 --> 04:07.360
We used to call her
"Doomstone the Destroyer."

04:07.440 --> 04:09.760
The terminator of schools.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.360
All the more reason to make sure

04:13.440 --> 04:16.120
that the school be presented
in the best possible light.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.399
This is no ordinary inspection.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.680
The fate of Miss Cackle
and the entire school depends upon it.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.080
For this reason,
I do not wish the girls to be informed.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Why is that?

04:31.800 --> 04:36.440
Because nerves and magic do not mix.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.080
Maud, Enid.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.400
- Miss Cackle's in trouble.
- No!

04:42.480 --> 04:45.400
- What kind of trouble?
- "She could lose her job" kind of trouble.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.520
She needs our support.
Are you coming?

04:47.600 --> 04:50.400
- Where to?
- Magic Council.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.120
We can't.
We've got HB for Potions... first thing.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.600
I'm not used to getting up this early,
Miss Hardbroom.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.360
Miss Bat will be covering
my Potions class this morning.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.520
Do not, however, use this as an excuse
to mess around.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.000
Do not take any nonsense
from the girls, Miss Bat.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.200
Miss Bat?

05:26.800 --> 05:29.160
It is important to keep awake, Miss Bat,

05:29.600 --> 05:31.720
today of all days.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
Right.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.400
This is our chance.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.080
Hey!

06:01.320 --> 06:04.040
Miss Bat? Miss Bat!

06:09.760 --> 06:11.480
Come on, we need to hurry!

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
Rise.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.640
Rise.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.600
Rise.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.680
Rise.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.360
Rise.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.600
Speak firmly to it, Sybil.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.360
Rise.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.896
I don't think I need to remind you,
Miss Drill,

06:28.920 --> 06:30.760
that our visitor
will be assessing the girls

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
on their Broomstick Attainment Tests.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.360
I can assure you they are all up to speed
on their BATS, Miss Hardbroom.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.440
Rise.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.400
For everyone's sake, I hope so.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.880
Stop daydreaming, Beatrice Bunch!

06:43.960 --> 06:45.720
You look as if you're catching flies!

06:48.760 --> 06:49.760
Come on, Sybil.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.920
Rise.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.680
What is going on in here?

07:03.680 --> 07:06.360
- Where is Miss Bat?
- We don't know, Miss Hardbroom.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.880
Unbelievable.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.600
Open your books. Page 25.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.840
I want you to make
a simple colour changing potion.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.160
Miss Drill, a word.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.400
Get on with your potions.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.440
Find Ethel Hallow and send her to me.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.080
We need our star pupil on show
the moment Miss Doomstone arrives.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.160
I'm on it.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.600
- Something's going on.
- I know.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.360
HB seems really jumpy today.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.960
For goodness' sake, Sybil Hallow!

07:47.720 --> 07:52.000
- What are you doing?
- I put foxbane in instead of nightshade.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.320
Your brilliant sister loses all her powers

07:56.640 --> 07:59.800
and you haven't the faintest idea
what to do with yours.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.840
You are a disgrace to the name of Hallow.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.600
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.040
Excuse me, Miss Hardbroom.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.120
I really don't think that's fair.

08:19.320 --> 08:24.640
Did I ask you to speak, Beatrice Bunch?

08:24.720 --> 08:25.760
No, Miss Hardbroom.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.800
Then don't.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.440
Start again!

08:36.799 --> 08:38.520
HB is a total monster.

08:39.240 --> 08:44.640
Never mind a colour changing potion,
we need a personality changing one.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.120
Something like this, you mean?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.600
"Personality Changing Potion."

08:58.320 --> 09:00.520
For reversing personality traits.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.600
Makes the timid person brave,

09:02.680 --> 09:07.760
"the sad person happy, and the hard-hearted
as soft as marshmallow."

09:07.840 --> 09:09.040
Oh, yes!

09:13.400 --> 09:14.400
Somebody's coming!

09:19.320 --> 09:20.560
<i>Aperi portum.</i>

09:32.720 --> 09:33.720
Go on.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.000
<i>Aperi portum.</i>

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
Let's go this way.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.080
It is with a heavy heart
that I have called you all here today

09:50.680 --> 09:53.560
to this disciplinary hearing
of Miss Cackle.

09:54.320 --> 09:58.640
Now, I'm sorry it's come to this,
but let us begin.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.440
I believe there was a fire
in a girl's bedroom,

10:04.320 --> 10:08.400
and a whole wing of the school fell down
at the beginning of term.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.216
And then, of course,
there's the whole matter

10:11.240 --> 10:16.840
of one of the students losing her powers
whilst under Miss Cackle's pastoral care.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.840
Mrs. Hallow, I believe you have something
to say about your daughter's condition.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
I do indeed.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.360
What a traitor.

10:28.400 --> 10:33.800
Okay, this is where Miss Hardbroom
becomes Miss Softbroom.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.360
Beatrice, this is a bad idea.
Don't do it.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.880
Miss Hardbroom,
my colour changing potion's ready.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.880
Nothing appears to be happening.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.720
Yes, Beatrice, nothing's happening.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.880
Tell you what, Miss Hardbroom.

11:09.680 --> 11:15.480
Why don't we forget about Potions class
for today and do something fun instead?

11:15.560 --> 11:17.040
What did you say?

11:17.880 --> 11:20.960
I said, um...

11:21.160 --> 11:25.600
Fun?

11:34.720 --> 11:35.800
Yes!

11:36.480 --> 11:39.200
Lessons should be fun.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.640
Why...

11:43.880 --> 11:45.800
not?

11:49.720 --> 11:50.720
Ooh!

11:56.280 --> 11:58.520
- Miss Hardbroom?
- Yes?

11:59.840 --> 12:02.000
Miss Drill said you wanted to see me.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
Did she?

12:04.840 --> 12:06.880
Is it to do with Mildred, Maud, and Enid?

12:08.360 --> 12:09.360
They've disappeared.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.360
Did they make an invisibility potion?

12:12.960 --> 12:15.560
No. They've left the school premises.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.440
Mm, for good? That's...

12:20.560 --> 12:22.480
three less to teach, then.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.120
- Did you lot make a laughter potion?
- Kind of.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.640
Maybe we'll go
and talk to Miss Drill again.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.200
Perhaps she'll remember.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.680
What happened to Esmerelda is a tragedy,

12:45.760 --> 12:49.360
and I lay the blame
entirely at Miss Cackle's feet.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.080
When we send our children to school,
we expect them to be safe.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.120
But it was Agatha who did it,
not Miss Cackle.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.960
Indeed, and that is why I've arranged
a school inspection visit for today.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.040
An inspection?

13:01.480 --> 13:04.800
Perhaps you had already left
before Miss Doomstone called.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.920
You are sending Doomstone the Destroyer
to inspect my school?

13:09.560 --> 13:11.160
Miss Cackle, remember where you are.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.960
<i>♪ Five little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log ♪</i>

13:18.040 --> 13:20.760
<i>♪ Eating some most delicious bugs ♪</i>

13:20.840 --> 13:21.920
Yum, yum!

13:22.000 --> 13:24.560
We're going to be in so much trouble
when HB finds out.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.800
Relax, Sybil. This is fun.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.720
- Define "fun".
- ♪ <i>...speckled frogs ♪</i>

13:30.720 --> 13:32.040
- Miss Hardbroom!
- Yum!

13:33.360 --> 13:36.480
- Can class be dismissed early for once?
- Yes. Why not?

13:37.480 --> 13:38.760
Good idea.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.040
She didn't seem interested,
did she, Felicity?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.880
- No.
- Quietly, girls.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.440
She seemed very distracted.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.280
Ugh! Aren't we all
with this inspection looming.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.520
What inspection?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.720
Well, that's what she wanted
to see you about, Ethel.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.080
She wants you to help
show the inspector around.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.120
- Ah, Miss Hardbroom.
- Ah! Miss Drill.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.640
I don't want to hear any talk
about work today.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.080
The girls are right.

14:06.160 --> 14:09.840
We all need to take time
to smell the roses.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.360
What roses?
She never asked me to get any roses.

14:16.440 --> 14:20.600
- Something's happened to Miss Hardbroom.
- Oh, my giddy bats.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.000
And I know who's to blame.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.920
What have you three done
to Miss Hardbroom?

14:25.400 --> 14:28.680
Why do you think we've done anything?

14:28.760 --> 14:30.480
Tell me now.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.920
The future of the entire school
depends on it.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.880
The inspector's arrived early.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.040
- She's in the entrance hall.
- No!

14:38.120 --> 14:41.520
- Shall I stall her, Miss Drill?
- Yes, get her out of the building, Ethel.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.000
What is it? What's wrong?

14:44.160 --> 14:46.560
Alright, you three, spill.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.840
Ah. Um, uh... Ooh, oh!

14:58.920 --> 15:00.560
How wonderfully exuberant!

15:01.200 --> 15:03.480
Girls, can anyone tell me
where I might find Miss...

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
Hardbroom?

15:10.520 --> 15:12.240
Well met, Miss Doomstone.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.280
I'm Ethel Hallow.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.560
- Would you like to follow me?
- Finally.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.920
And I am disappointed
at Mrs. Hallow's negativity.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.080
I cannot help but question her motives.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.760
The fact that she has sent all three
of her daughters to my school

15:30.240 --> 15:32.360
shows a degree of trust
in Cackle's Academy.

15:32.440 --> 15:35.600
You have lost any trust that you had,
Miss Cackle.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.600
And not just with me,
but with the majority of the parents.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.080
I have a petition here,

15:43.480 --> 15:46.360
signed by 80 percent of the parents,

15:47.400 --> 15:52.400
demanding Miss Cackle
be removed from the school.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.400
- May I see it?
- You may.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.680
Thank you.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.760
Do you have anything
to say in your defence?

16:24.880 --> 16:29.080
Taken at face value,
all the accusations are true.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.120
Your Greatness, I will take
full and personal responsibility,

16:35.320 --> 16:38.720
but I beg you to keep the academy open.

16:44.720 --> 16:49.120
Are you sure you haven't been drinking
witch's brew, Miss Hardbroom?

16:49.200 --> 16:54.160
Miss Hardbroom, you have to come with me
to the Potions lab immediately.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.560
Why?

16:57.640 --> 17:01.960
Because the inspector has arrived
and she can't see you like this.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.960
Doomstone the Destroyer is here?

17:05.040 --> 17:07.640
The inspection visit. Of course.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.440
I wonder if she likes roses.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.079
I'll go and see her.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.040
No! Miss Hardbroom
that's not a very good...

17:14.599 --> 17:17.800
Miss Mould, bring Miss Bat
and the rest of the staff up to speed.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.839
Felicity, let the rest of the girls know
about the inspection.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.079
And, you, find an antidote, sharpish!

17:25.880 --> 17:27.240
I need to find Miss Hardbroom.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.800
I will bear what you have to say in mind.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.520
Now, if you have nothing else to say,

17:33.080 --> 17:34.440
- I suggest...
- Wait!

17:35.320 --> 17:36.640
We have something to say!

17:41.440 --> 17:44.680
- Mildred Hubble.
- You girls should be in school.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.080
You see? This is a perfect example
of what I've been talking about.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.120
What are you girls doing here?

17:50.720 --> 17:53.800
We are here as character witnesses
for you, Miss Cackle.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.920
Please let us speak.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.640
And this is the Witchball court.
We have an excellent team.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.840
And although I don't like to brag,
I'm one of the star players.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.640
Why, exactly, are we outside, my dear?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.080
Um...

18:11.280 --> 18:13.360
We're doing the exterior tour first.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.200
Before the rain sets in.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.960
It isn't forecast to rain.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.080
Now, this way to the herb garden.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.560
We have a marvelous display of rosemary,
basil, and thyme.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.160
You're wasting my time, Miss Hallow.
Take me to Miss Hardbroom.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.760
But you haven't seen
the family trees yet either.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.680
And Miss Hardbroom expressly told me to...

18:33.760 --> 18:37.360
I smell a big fat rat, Miss Hallow.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.360
That's probably the manure
that Mr. Rowan Webb puts on his roses.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.560
Now, Miss Hallow.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.880
Miss Doomstone, wait!

18:51.120 --> 18:53.080
Everything Miss Cackle ever does

18:53.160 --> 18:56.360
is based on what is best
for the school and the girls.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.960
She doesn't tick boxes and suck up
to committees and Magic Councils.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.040
She gets on with the job
and teaches us girls how to fly.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.840
And I don't mean on a broomstick either.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.440
- Miss Cackle takes risks.
- My point exactly.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.560
But not on health and safety
as suggested today.

19:17.560 --> 19:18.560
On people.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.040
She took a risk on me,
and I will always be grateful for that.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.480
Please don't take her from us.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.080
She's our role model and we love her.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.040
- Don't you want to see the family trees?
- No! I want to see Miss Hardbroom.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.960
Where is she?

19:42.560 --> 19:44.320
Come with me!

19:52.680 --> 19:54.920
Jimson weed.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.360
- A ladle of frog gloop.
- A ladle of frog gloop.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.080
- Ah, here.
- Quickly, Sybil.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.840
A ladle of frog gloop.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.360
Ugh!

20:13.440 --> 20:15.440
And finally,

20:15.520 --> 20:20.080
a spoonful of the original
personality changing potion.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.320
It's going a different colour.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.280
Mm. Green for the original,
red for the antidote.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.760
Okay, let me strain this,
and then we'll give it to Miss Hardbroom.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.240
We couldn't stall her any longer.
She's on her way here with Miss Bat.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.440
Uh...

20:39.520 --> 20:42.480
quickly, quickly,
come and drink this, Miss Hardbroom.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.120
You give it to her, Clarice.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.800
- Help me tidy up, Ethel!
- Hey, Miss Hardbroom! Drink this!

20:49.320 --> 20:54.280
What are you trying to hide from me?
I know you, Miss Batty, from days of old.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.440
It's Bat! You know it's Bat!

20:58.800 --> 21:00.160
I will not taste it!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.080
It smells disgusting!

21:02.160 --> 21:04.480
- Miss Hardbroom! Stop it!
- No! No!

21:05.600 --> 21:08.520
- How about this one instead?
- No, no!

21:13.200 --> 21:17.520
- Well met, Miss Doomstone.
- Miss Hardbroom?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.680
What's been going on in here?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.960
We've been having fun in class.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.680
Fun? A school isn't a place
to have fun, Miss... Ah!

21:28.720 --> 21:30.160
Oh!

21:30.240 --> 21:31.480
- My hat!
- Frog gloop!

21:32.160 --> 21:34.360
Miss Doomstone, are you alright?

21:37.600 --> 21:40.240
This school is finished.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.680
After what Mildred said,
there's no way they're getting rid of you.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.640
You spoke very well, Mildred.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.560
- It's going to be okay, Miss Cackle.
- Of course it is.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.640
I wonder how they're getting on
with the inspection.

22:05.720 --> 22:09.680
I'm sure with Miss Hardbroom in charge,
everything will be going swimmingly.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.480
You can't go yet.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.560
- You haven't seen the whole school.
- Or my A-star projects.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.640
I've seen quite enough,
thank you very much.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.000
- But, Miss Doomstone...
- Don't touch me!

22:22.520 --> 22:24.760
- Oh, no, the frog gloop!
- Frog?

22:25.160 --> 22:27.640
- She okay?
- Frog in throat!

22:27.720 --> 22:29.800
Somebody do something!

22:33.920 --> 22:35.960
Well done, Ethel.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.320
Here. Drink this.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.960
- Stop! Miss Doomstone!
- Oh, no, wait!

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
No!

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
Better?

22:48.800 --> 22:49.920
That was close.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.840
Cheers, Ethel. Job well done.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.160
Is that what I think it is?

22:58.120 --> 22:59.120
Yeah.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.760
How are you feeling, Miss Doomstone?

23:12.040 --> 23:14.680
Absolutely marvelous!

23:14.760 --> 23:16.640
You people have saved my life.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.080
I shall be eternally grateful!

23:19.480 --> 23:20.840
What are you girls gawping at?

23:22.080 --> 23:25.680
Take these back to where they came from.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.520
- Welcome back, Miss Hardbroom.
- I haven't been away.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
Have I?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.936
Miss Cackle,
the council have made their decision.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.480
Would you take your place, please?

24:04.680 --> 24:07.120
What an absolutely charming school.

24:07.200 --> 24:12.040
Such well-mannered, responsible girls
and a most dedicated teaching staff.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.000
I've had a wonderful time.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.200
Well, apart from almost choking
to death on a frog, that is.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.880
Don't worry, I won't tell.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.680
In fact, I probably shouldn't
mention this,

24:28.760 --> 24:31.360
but I've already reported back
to the Magic Council

24:31.440 --> 24:32.640
to let them know my decision.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.800
Which is?

24:37.760 --> 24:39.320
The school is to remain open!

24:46.960 --> 24:49.440
Toodle-pip! Well done.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.800
Why was everyone so scared of her?
She seemed perfectly pleasant.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.640
I did it!

24:59.840 --> 25:01.920
I saved the school.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.160
Miss Drill, shouldn't we have given
Miss Doomstone the antidote?

25:12.480 --> 25:15.240
Don't worry.
The potion will wear off eventually.

25:15.840 --> 25:19.160
- Over the next six months or so.
- Six months?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.960
Does Miss Hardbroom know
what happened today?

25:23.320 --> 25:26.920
She can't remember you giving her
the potion, if that's what you mean.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.160
Will you tell her?

25:30.960 --> 25:31.960
No.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.360
Thank you.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.440
You won't be thanking me

25:34.480 --> 25:37.800
when you've spent a whole day
cleaning out the sports cupboard.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.880
I think some of the Softbroom potion
must have rubbed off on HB.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.280
She almost smiled just then.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
Well, maybe.

26:02.680 --> 26:06.080
Compared to someone like Miss Doomstone,
she's really not that bad after all.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.960
Well met, everybody.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.280
I don't know what you all did
to charm Miss Doomstone today,

26:40.920 --> 26:43.240
but whatever it was,
you did a very good job.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.320
She gave the school a glowing report.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.560
So, why the long faces?

26:53.640 --> 26:55.080
What is it, Ada?

27:00.240 --> 27:04.240
- I am no longer your headmistress.
- No! What?

27:06.080 --> 27:08.280
The council have decreed
that a new head teacher

27:08.360 --> 27:10.120
be appointed to this school.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.280
I will be leaving at the end of term

27:13.360 --> 27:17.520
and Miss Hardbroom will continue
as acting head

27:17.840 --> 27:19.480
until a replacement can be found.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.560
Thankfully,
the school itself will remain open,

27:27.360 --> 27:30.200
so I am very grateful to you all for that,
so well done.
