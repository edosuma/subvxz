32:12.264 --> 32:14.005
EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS TALKING

32:14.099 --> 32:16.306
ABOUT HOW MY STUFF
SOUNDS LIKE SHAKESPEARE'S.

32:16.393 --> 32:19.385
VVILL, <i>BUBBEE,</i> I'M GONNA MAKE
YOU A HOUSEHOLD VVORD AGAIN.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.470
WITH ALL
DUE MODESTY, SIR,

32:21.565 --> 32:24.478
THE NAME OF VVILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
HAS SURVIVED THE TEST OF TIME

32:24.568 --> 32:26.479
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT
OF JULIUS MOOMER.

32:26.570 --> 32:27.856
YOU DON'T DIG.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.313
FAME FLITS.

32:30.407 --> 32:33.024
I MEAN, WHO REMEMBERS
YESTERDAY'S CHAMPIONS?

32:33.118 --> 32:35.075
SURE, RUTH HIT
6O HOME RUNS,

32:35.162 --> 32:37.654
BUT IT'S ROGER MARIS THEY'RE
ALVVAYS ASKING FOR AUTOGRAPHS.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.875
AND NIJINSKY VVAS A
PRETTY GOOD DANCER.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.370
BUT WHO REMEMBERS
HER LAST MOVIE?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.372
AND WILL SHAKESPEARE
DID SOME WRITING

32:44.463 --> 32:46.545
BUT OUT OF SIGHT,
OUT OF MIND.

32:46.631 --> 32:50.545
SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD,
LONG LIVE MICKEY SPILLANE!

32:50.635 --> 32:52.137
LOOK, LOOK, WILL, BABY,

32:52.220 --> 32:53.676
WILL, BABY, COME HERE.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.050
LOOK, YOU CAN'T
DESERT THE SHIP NOW.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.178
I MEAN, WHAT ARE
PEOPLE GOING TO SAY?

32:58.268 --> 33:01.306
THAT FINK SHAKESPEARE
GOT NO GRATITUDE.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.978
WE CAN DO IT, BABY,
WE CAN DO IT.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.726
LOOK, WE GOT A HUNDRED
PROJECTS WE CAN DO.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.058
WE'LL GO TO HOLLYWOOD,
CALIFORNIA.

33:08.153 --> 33:11.691
BABES OUT THERE ARE CRAZY
ABOUT GUYS WITH BEARDS.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.488
I SHALL PONDER IT,
MR. MOOMER.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.906
UNTIL WHEN?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.529
UNTIL THE MORROW.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.202
SINCE YOU HAVE
NOT SEEN FIT

33:18.288 --> 33:20.074
TO INVITE ME TO THE
REHEARSALS OF OUR PLAY,

33:20.165 --> 33:21.701
TOMORROW I SHALL
DO PRECISELY THAT.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.748
I SHALL SURVEY THE
ACTORS PERFORMING,

33:23.835 --> 33:25.997
AND IF JUSTICE IS DONE
TO WHAT I HAVE WROUGHT

33:26.087 --> 33:27.919
PERHAPS I MAY REMAIN
FOR A TIME LONGER

33:28.006 --> 33:30.919
AND WRITE OTHER THINGS.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.511
NOW YOU'RE
TALKING, WILL!

33:32.594 --> 33:34.505
NOW YOU'RE TALKING!

33:34.596 --> 33:37.679
I THINK I WILL
TAKE A WALK NOW.

33:37.766 --> 33:41.430
"I AM THAT MERRY
WANDERER OF THE NIGHT."

33:41.520 --> 33:47.607
<i>A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,
ACT TWO, SCENE ONE.</i>

33:47.692 --> 33:49.603
"TO BE, OR NOT TO BE,"

33:49.694 --> 33:51.355
MR. MOOMER, "THAT..."

34:08.713 --> 34:11.626
GO TO THE REHEARSAL?

34:11.716 --> 34:14.629
HOW COULD HE
GO TO THE REHEARSAL?

34:14.719 --> 34:18.303
WILL! WILL!

34:18.389 --> 34:20.051
WILL, DON'T
ROCK THE BOAT!

34:25.981 --> 34:27.722
(male voice)
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.560
GIVE ME YOUR
ATTENTION, PLEASE.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.065
VVE CAN VVALK THROUGH
THIS ONE VVITH SCRIPTS,

34:31.110 --> 34:33.819
BUT I'D COUNT IT
A PERSONAL FAVOR

34:33.905 --> 34:35.235
IF WE COULD
GET THESE LINES LEARNED

34:35.282 --> 34:37.239
BY THURSDAY AT THE LATEST.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.985
I HATE TO THROW
COMPLICATED STAGE ACTION

34:39.077 --> 34:40.442
AT YOU NOW AT THIS POINT,

34:40.536 --> 34:42.027
BUT YOU'LL NOTE
THAT IN THIS ACT,

34:42.121 --> 34:43.829
WE'VE GOT A REAL PROBLEM
OF MOVEMENT.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.906
I WANT TO TAKE MOST
OF THIS STUFF IN CLOSE SHOTS

34:46.001 --> 34:49.460
AND SOME VERY RAPID, SPORADIC
CUTTING BACK AND FORTH.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.456
I THINK IT'LL HEIGHTEN
THE PIECE TREMENDOUSLY.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.505
MR. SHANNON, WE FEEL OURSELVES
EXTREMELY FORTUNATE

34:54.592 --> 34:57.426
TO SECURE THE SERVICES
OF ROCKY RHODES.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.298
RHODES, SCHMODES.
I SELL SOUP.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.175
I DON'T NOTHING
ABOUT ACTORS.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.348
WHICH ONE IS RHODES?

35:03.435 --> 35:09.147
HE'S THE ATTRACTIVE ONE
IN THE SWEATSHIRT.

35:09.232 --> 35:12.645
THAT'S AN ACTOR?

35:12.736 --> 35:15.979
WELL, HE WAS BRILLIANT
IN STREETCAR <i>NAMED</i> DES/RE.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.574
<i>STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE?</i>

35:17.657 --> 35:19.739
WHAT WAS HE,
A CONDUCTOR?

35:19.826 --> 35:22.363
<i>(director) ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
WE'LL PICK IT UP NOW.</i>

35:22.454 --> 35:27.119
<i>SCENE TWO, ACT TWO.
UH, FELICIA...</i>

35:27.167 --> 35:29.499
NOW, REMEMBER, FELICIA,
AT THIS MOMENT

35:29.586 --> 35:32.453
LIFE AND DEATH IS VVAITING FOR
YOU OUT IN THAT HALLVVAY.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.791
THIS IS UNEQUIVOCAL.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.502
IT IS LIFE
OR IT IS DEATH.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.129
WHEN ROCKY COMES
THROUGH THAT DOOR--

35:38.178 --> 35:40.670
[in Brando-like drawl]
UH...

35:40.764 --> 35:43.506
CHARLIE...

35:43.600 --> 35:45.967
UH...

35:46.061 --> 35:47.051
QUESTION.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.647
QUESTION, ROCKY?

35:48.688 --> 35:50.474
YEAH, I MEAN,
WHAT IS MY, UH,

35:50.565 --> 35:52.397
TERTIARY MOTIVATION HERE?

35:52.484 --> 35:56.193
I MEAN, LIKE, I VVALK
THROUGH THE DOOR AND, UH...

35:56.279 --> 35:57.986
I SEE HER.

35:58.031 --> 35:59.738
WHY?

35:59.824 --> 36:01.986
WHY WHAT, ROCKY?
WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

36:02.077 --> 36:03.408
EXACTLY.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.077
WHAT IS THE QUESTION?

36:05.163 --> 36:07.655
I MEAN, ANY SLOB
CAN WALK THROUGH A DOOR.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.493
LIKE, I DO IT EVERY DAY.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.495
BUT, WELL, NOW

36:11.586 --> 36:13.668
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T WALK
THROUGH THE DOOR

36:13.713 --> 36:15.215
AT THAT MOMENT.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.414
<i>SO I GOT
TO ASK MYSELF."</i>

36:17.509 --> 36:19.921
<i>WOULD I WALK
THROUGH THAT DOOR?</i>

36:20.011 --> 36:24.596
IT'S ON THE BASIS OF THAT ANSVVER
THAT I FIND MY MOTIVATION.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.094
SO THE QUESTION IS

36:26.184 --> 36:28.391
WHAT'S MY MOTIVATION?

36:31.773 --> 36:33.184
WELL, ROCKY, BABY,

36:33.274 --> 36:34.776
WHY DON'T WE JUST
RUN THROUGH IT

36:34.859 --> 36:36.520
AND SEE HOW IT PLAYS,
SHALL WE DO THAT?

36:36.611 --> 36:38.193
LET'S TAKE OUR
PLACES NOW.

36:38.238 --> 36:39.694
SCENE TWO OF ACT TWO.

36:39.781 --> 36:40.987
RIGHT FROM THE TOP.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.906
[actor, mooing]
MMM, MMM.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.118
MM-MM.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.866
[snorting]

36:47.956 --> 36:50.914
MM-MM.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.710
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.871
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.881
IF JEREMY
COMES HERE TONIGHT

36:59.926 --> 37:01.883
I HAVE TO
GO AWAY WITH HIM.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.335
OH, COME, OLIVIA.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.091
CAST OUT THOSE
BENIGHTED COLORS

37:05.181 --> 37:09.049
AND-AND GAZE AS A FRIEND
ON GREENWICH VILLAGE.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.385
LET NOT FOREVER
WITH YOUR VEILED EYES

37:11.438 --> 37:14.226
SEEK YOUR NOBLE BOYFRIEND
IN THE DUST.

37:14.274 --> 37:15.730
IT IS COMMON, I KNOW.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.809
BUT ALL THAT LIVE MUST DIE.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.315
IT'S EASY FOR
YOU TO SAY.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.067
<i>QUITE EASY.</i>

37:23.116 --> 37:25.107
<i>BUT OUTSIDE THERE,</i>

37:25.201 --> 37:26.817
<i>OUTSIDE THIS ROOM,</i>

37:26.911 --> 37:28.948
<i>OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING</i>

37:29.038 --> 37:32.997
IS THE HARBINGER OF
THE WORST OF FATES.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.995
IS IT JEREMY?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.498
OR IS IT HIS KILLER?

37:37.589 --> 37:41.127
AM I TO BE A
CORRESPONDENT OF LOVE...

37:41.217 --> 37:43.595
OR A RECIPIENT OF HATE?

37:43.636 --> 37:45.468
<i>THIS IS THE QUESTION.</i>

37:45.555 --> 37:46.966
<i>WHO AWAITS ME
OUT THERE?</i>

37:47.056 --> 37:48.797
I ASK YOU THAT.

37:48.892 --> 37:49.973
WHO AWAITS ME?

38:06.868 --> 38:08.700
I'M LOOKING
FOR MR. MOOMER.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.529
MOOMER?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.614
<i>JULIUS MOOMER.</i>

38:13.666 --> 38:15.794
OH, YEAH, THE WRITER.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.618
HE'S SITTING OVER THERE
WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.833
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.461
AND YOUR ROLE?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.797
MY ROLE IS,
UH... JEREMY.

38:25.845 --> 38:26.880
WHAT'S YOURS?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.553
JEREMY.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.222
BUT JEREMY
IS A LAD OF 19,

38:30.308 --> 38:31.673
FRESH AS A BRIDEGROOM.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.679
<i>AND HIS CHIN,
NEW-REAPED</i>

38:33.770 --> 38:36.228
<i>SHOWED LIKE A STUBBLE
LAND AT HARVEST HOME.</i>

38:36.314 --> 38:39.056
YEAH, WELL, WE
CHANGED ALL THAT.

38:39.150 --> 38:43.986
A GUY THAT FEELS LOVE
AIN'T NO 19 YEARS OLD.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.562
THE GUY WHO PLAYS JEREMY

38:45.657 --> 38:47.364
HAS GOT TO KNOW
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.738
<i>A MATURE GUY, UH...
WHO KNOWS THE SCORE.</i>

38:50.829 --> 38:53.992
A GUY WITH SOME 'ZAZZ,
WITH SOME MOXIE.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.998
A GUY VVHO UNDERSTANDS,
UH, TERTIARY MOTIVATION.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.871
<i>(director) LET'S' GO,
TEAM, SHAL I WE?</i>

38:58.962 --> 39:00.293

39:00.380 --> 39:01.495
GET READY FOR
YOUR CUE, ROCKY.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.334
RHODES IS MY NAME.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.256

39:12.350 --> 39:14.682
AND WHAT, PERCHANCE,
WOULD THAT BE?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.885
IT WOULD BE
A PLAY, CHARLIE.

39:16.980 --> 39:19.017
A REAL PLAY.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.848
WHAT ARE YOU,
A TENNESSEE KNOCKER?

39:20.942 --> 39:22.933
<i>ROCKY, LET'S GO!</i>

39:23.027 --> 39:27.021

39:40.211 --> 39:42.373
HOW'S IT LOOK TO
YOU, MR. SHANNON?

39:42.422 --> 39:44.288
ONLY GREAT,
ISN'T IT?

39:44.382 --> 39:46.043
THE PLAY?

39:46.134 --> 39:48.216
WHO KNOWS
ABOUT PLAYS?

39:48.261 --> 39:51.629
WHAT ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL,
WHERE DOES THAT COME IN?

39:51.723 --> 39:54.556
R-RIGHT AFTER THE OPENING
TEASER, MR. SHANNON.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.383
ARE THEY LIGHTING
THE SOUP?

39:56.477 --> 39:58.559
THAT COMES IN THE FIRST COMMERCIAL, MR.
SHANNON.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.141
I KNOW WHEN IT COMES IN.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.563
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THEY LIGHT THE LABEL!

40:02.650 --> 40:04.436
WHEN THE SOUP
IS SHANNON'S

40:04.527 --> 40:06.814
I WANT 4O MILLION PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW IT'S SHANNON'S.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.154
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.625
WHAT'S HE
DRESSED UP FOR?

40:18.708 --> 40:21.666
U-UH, THAT?

40:21.753 --> 40:26.668
T-THAT'S MY TYPIST.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.749
ONE OF YOUR STAFF,
MOOMER, IS HE?

40:28.801 --> 40:31.759
WELL, ACTUALLY,
HE'S A RELATIVE.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.841
COUSIN ON MY
MOTHER'S SIDE.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.969
HE'S A LITTLE ECCENTRIC.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.766
ECCENTRIC?

40:37.852 --> 40:40.310
<i>WELL, HE HAS, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, DELUSIONS.</i>

40:40.396 --> 40:42.262
ONE WEEK THEY COME,
ONE WEEK THEY GO.

40:42.315 --> 40:44.056
WHAT ABOUT
THIS WEEK?

40:44.150 --> 40:47.643
UM, WELL, THIS
WEEK, HE, UH...

40:47.737 --> 40:53.232
HE THINKS HE'S
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.612
COME ON OVER, WILL,

40:54.702 --> 40:56.613
IWANT YOU
TO MEET THE BOYS.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.820
BEEN TELLING THEM
ALL ABOUT YOU.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.249
MOST IMPRESSIVE.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.705
WOULD THAT WE HAD

41:08.800 --> 41:10.632
THIS KIND OF SPACE
AT THE GLOBE.

41:10.677 --> 41:11.792
THE GLOBE?

41:11.886 --> 41:13.627
UH, UH, WHY
DON'T YOU

41:13.680 --> 41:15.466
SIT DOWN,

HAVE THIS SEAT HERE.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.341
WE'RE, UH,

41:19.435 --> 41:20.470
THE SECOND ACT.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.806
ACT TWO.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.261
AH, YES,
THE BALCONY SCENE.

41:23.356 --> 41:25.063
A MOST DELIGHTFUL
LOVE SEQUENCE.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.765
LOVE SEQUENCE, AND
ON A BALCONY, YET.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.725
I WAS GONNA MENTION
THIS TO YOU, WILL,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.187
BUT MR. SHANNON ASKED US
TO MAKE A LITTLE CHANGE

41:31.280 --> 41:32.532
IN THE LOVE STORY PART.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.151
OH?

41:34.242 --> 41:36.609
YOU KNOVV, THE BUSINESS
ON THE BALCONY?

41:36.703 --> 41:38.319
A THING OF BEAUTY.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.370
"OH, SPIRIT OF LOVE

41:40.456 --> 41:43.323
HOW QUICK AND FRESH
ART THOU."

41:43.418 --> 41:45.500
A RED-BLOODED
AMERICAN BOY AND GIRL

41:45.545 --> 41:47.786
GOING GIGGING AROUND
ON BALCONIES!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.791
WHO OWNS BALCONIES
THESE DAYS?

41:49.882 --> 41:51.793
EXTREMELY VALID POINT,
MR. SHANNON.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.261
NO QUESTION
ABOUT IT.

41:53.344 --> 41:56.257
YOU MEAN, NO BALCONY?

41:56.347 --> 41:59.760
MM, UH, NO BALCONY.

CLIMBING UP THE SHRUBBERY

42:11.070 --> 42:12.981

HE, UH... UH, UH...

42:13.072 --> 42:15.404
MEETS HER IN A
SUBWAY STATION.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.777
A SUBWAY STATION?!

42:16.868 --> 42:18.575
THAT'S A BIT.
THAT'S A BIT.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.368
SEE, SHE SPRAINS HER
ANKLE, AND THIS BOY HERE,

42:20.455 --> 42:22.196
HE'S KIND OF A DR. KILDARE,
DR. CASEY TYPE,

AND HE OPERATES ON HER
ANKLE RIGHT THERE

42:24.292 --> 42:26.579
BETVVEEN THE BRIGHTON EXPRESS
AND THE BRONX LOCAL.

42:26.669 --> 42:29.457

42:36.596 --> 42:39.213
<i>(director) I WANT YOU TO RUN

42:47.648 --> 42:48.934
MR. MOOMER,
MR. MOOMER,

42:49.025 --> 42:50.936
SOMETHING HAS
TO BE DONE.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.358
TROUBLES, WILL?

42:52.445 --> 42:55.153
TROUBLES? IS
THAT ESMERALDA?

42:55.239 --> 42:57.651
<i>YEAH. YEAH,

42:57.742 --> 42:59.733
VVELL, IF VVHAT YOU
TOLD ME IS THE CASE,

42:59.827 --> 43:01.443
WHAT REASON
FOR HER SUICIDE?

43:01.537 --> 43:03.403
WHAT IS TO MOTIVATE
HER LONG SOLILOQUY

43:03.456 --> 43:04.742
ABOUT LOVE'S LABOR LOST?

43:04.832 --> 43:05.993
SUICIDE?

43:06.084 --> 43:07.825
WHAT'S WITH THIS SUICIDE?

43:07.919 --> 43:09.785
OH, NO SUICIDE,
MR. SHANNON.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.586
THAT'S DEFINITELY OUT.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.879
I VVAS GONNA MENTION
THAT TO YOU, VVILL.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.378
YOU SEE, WE CAN'T LIVE
WITH THE SUICIDE.

43:16.469 --> 43:18.585
SHE DON'T STICK
HERSELF WITH A SHIV.

43:18.679 --> 43:21.171
INSTEAD SHE RUNS AWAY
WITH THIS BASS FIDDLER

43:21.265 --> 43:23.176
FROM ARTIE SHAW'S
GRAMERCY FIVE.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.178
THAT VVAS MY VVIFE'S SUGGESTION.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.055
AN INSPIRED
ONE, AT THAT.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.763
AND THE BROTHER AND FATHER
WHO BURST INTO THE SCENE?

43:29.857 --> 43:32.269
MY WIFE
DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.101
SHE DIDN'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF

43:34.195 --> 43:35.936
THE FATHER AND
THE BROTHER, WILL,

43:35.988 --> 43:37.695
SO THE WAY
WE PLAY IT NOW

43:37.782 --> 43:40.149
THE TWO GUYS COMING INTO
THE ROOM ARE POLICEMEN.

43:45.581 --> 43:46.662
POLICEMEN?

43:46.749 --> 43:49.332
COPS, COPS.

43:49.418 --> 43:50.920
AND IN THE SCENE LATER ON,

43:51.003 --> 43:52.289
WHERE THE MOTHER
DOES ALL THE TALKING

43:52.380 --> 43:54.041
ABOUT THE BLOOD
ON OUR HANDS,

43:54.132 --> 43:56.965
WELL, SHE'S NOT THE
MOTHER NO MORE, EXACTLY.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.667
SHE'S THE GARDENER'S WIFE

43:58.761 --> 44:00.502
WHO DID TIME
FOR EMBEZZLEMENT.

44:00.596 --> 44:03.463
BUT SHE HAS THE MOST
DEFINITl\/E LINE OF THE PLAY.

44:03.558 --> 44:06.050

44:21.868 --> 44:23.324
IS PAYING THIS
KIND OF MONEY

44:23.369 --> 44:25.406
TO MAKE PEOPLE SICK?

44:25.496 --> 44:29.706
UH, WILL, YOU'D
BETTER GET WITH IT.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.250
YOU'RE TAKING THE BUTTER

44:53.900 --> 44:55.641

STUDENT OF DRAMA.

44:55.735 --> 45:01.026
