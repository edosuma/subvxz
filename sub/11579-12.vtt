00:01.501 --> 00:03.264
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.336 --> 00:06.965
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.040 --> 00:08.098
In New York City,

00:08.173 --> 00:11.337
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.411 --> 00:14.778
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.848 --> 00:16.816
These are their stories,

00:17.717 --> 00:19.241
(PANTING)

00:21.554 --> 00:23.215
Hurry, Mama!
Hurry.

00:23.289 --> 00:25.951
Mijo, run.
Tell them. Go!

00:31.965 --> 00:34.365
Whoa! What's the rush?

00:34.434 --> 00:36.163
My brother.
He's been shot.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.225
Where is he?

00:37.303 --> 00:38.668
They're coming.

00:38.738 --> 00:39.864
Give him to me.
No, he's my baby.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.270
I'II take him inside.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.775
I got a gunshot wound here!
Hurry!

00:44.544 --> 00:47.980
Prep trauma one.
Page surgery
and tell OR to stand by.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.209
Doctor,
please save my baby.
Save him.

00:50.283 --> 00:52.751
There's no exit wound.
Let's go. Forget trauma.

00:52.819 --> 00:55.310
Oh, my God,
don't Iet him die.
Save him.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.912
He's in good hands.
PIease!

00:56.990 --> 00:58.048
Let's take
a Iook at you.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.148
Mommy. Mommy.

00:59.225 --> 01:02.456
Officer Jones is gonna
take you for a snack
while I help your mom.

01:02.529 --> 01:06.488
No. No. No!
I'm staying with her.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.700
Post two, notify NYPD
for a GSW victim.

01:10.770 --> 01:13.102
No, no.
No police, please.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.573
Ma'am,
your son has
been shot.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.735
We have to
call the police.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.779
Now,
what is your name?

01:20.513 --> 01:22.037
Lupe Rodriguez.

01:22.549 --> 01:23.573
And your son who's wounded?

01:23.650 --> 01:24.742
Jorge.

01:25.518 --> 01:28.214
PIease,
go and check on him.
PIease.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.312
Mommy.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.324
He's gonna be okay.
Baby, he's gonna be okay.

01:34.794 --> 01:36.455
GUARD:
The kid's Iucky.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.328
Still critical,
but the docs say

01:38.398 --> 01:39.990
he should make it
through surgery.

01:40.066 --> 01:41.124
Where's the mother?

01:41.201 --> 01:44.728
In the waiting room
with her older son.
Real shaken up.

01:49.809 --> 01:50.798
Where is she?

01:50.877 --> 01:52.037
She's gone.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.094 --> 02:42.391
She had the kid
in her arms.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.554
Came from
over there.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.723
I carried him in,
bleeding all over the place.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.766
Did you search
the building?
Yes.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.270
Didn't even wait to see
if her son was dead or alive.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.835
You're from
Special Victims?

02:52.906 --> 02:54.567
Yeah, we handle
the child abandonment cases.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.506
Now, Jorge,
how's he doing?

02:56.576 --> 02:58.134
Just out of surgery.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.473
And the mother
was acting strange?

02:59.546 --> 03:02.447
She freaked
when she heard me
call the cops.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.744
Jorge was shot once
in the Iower abdomen.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.217
Any idea
how old he is?

03:07.287 --> 03:09.084
Five, maybe six.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.486
What are his chances?

03:10.557 --> 03:14.220
We got the slug.
Didn't hit any major
arteries or organs.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.023
He'II recover
from this,

03:16.095 --> 03:17.892
but he's got
bigger problems.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.829
Bigger problems
than getting shot?

03:19.899 --> 03:22.697
Chest film showed
multiple healed
rib fractures,

03:22.769 --> 03:24.930
so I ordered
a skeletal survey.

03:25.004 --> 03:27.165
Found even more
healed fractures.

03:27.240 --> 03:31.404
His Ieft ulna, humerus,
one on each side of his face.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.972
STABLER: Doctor said the kid
had the crap kicked
out of him for years.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.879
And nobody in that ER
recognized him?

03:36.950 --> 03:38.008
Or the name.

03:38.084 --> 03:39.847
No Jorge Rodriguez
or anyone

03:39.919 --> 03:41.784
matching those injuries
having been treated there.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.584
Mother gave
a phony home address
and social security number.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.921
I mean, Lupe's probably
not even her real name.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.621
So they're new in the area,
or the mother hit
a different hospital

03:49.696 --> 03:51.254
every time
the boy was injured.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.196
Makes it harder
to pick up on the abuse.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.665
Could be she's protecting
a boyfriend

03:54.734 --> 03:56.634
who thought the kid
was an inconvenience.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.365
How about the victim
or his brother were
playing with a gun?

03:59.439 --> 04:01.134
STABLER: He was shot
with a 9 mill.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.606
No stippling
or powder burns.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.438
Bullet was still
inside of him.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.068
He had to be shot from
some kind of distance.

04:06.145 --> 04:08.943
Great, so we got false ID
on the victim and the mother,

04:09.015 --> 04:11.916
no perp, no weapon.
Do we at Ieast
have a crime scene?

04:11.985 --> 04:14.545
Checked communications
and the Iocal precinct.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.180
No reports of any shootings
around the time
the boy was brought in.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.192
Well, that woman
couldn't have run very far
carrying 50 extra pounds.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.784
Cab or car service
would've dropped them

04:21.861 --> 04:23.726
right off at the
emergency room doors.

04:23.796 --> 04:26.822
CRAGEN: Fin, John,
check with transit
just in case.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.265
After that, call every ER
in the five boroughs.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.666
See if anyone
remembers a child

04:30.737 --> 04:32.762
with our John Doe's
old injuries.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.273
Chances are, this family Iives
somewhere near that hospital,

04:35.341 --> 04:38.276
and those kids had to
go to school somewhere.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.909
STABLER:
Do you recognize this child?

04:46.185 --> 04:50.554
It's Miguel Ramos,
one of our first graders.
What happened to him?

04:50.623 --> 04:51.988
BENSON: He was shot.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.526
Oh, good Lord.
How is he?

04:54.594 --> 04:57.791
Critical, but the doctors
expect him to recover.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.332
That must be why
Luis is absent today.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.628
Luis is Miguel's brother?

05:01.701 --> 05:03.760
Yeah.
One of our fifth graders.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.304
Both good students. Quiet,
never cause any trouble.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.396
We're Iooking
for their mother,

05:07.473 --> 05:10.067
but she gave a phony name
and address at the hospital.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.804
That must be a habit of hers.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.779
The Ietter I sent
to their home Iast week
came back today.

05:14.847 --> 05:18.146
No such address.
Phone number's
out of service, too.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.651
That's why I was
Iooking for Luis
this morning.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.916
Her name is Maria.
Maria Ramos.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.254
522 Cherry Street.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.558
That's in the middle
of the East River Park.

05:30.763 --> 05:33.527
Now, she would have
had to show proof
of her current address

05:33.599 --> 05:34.725
to register the boys, right?

05:34.801 --> 05:36.530
Yeah. I have a copy
of her Iease.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.661
I mean,
she enrolled the boys
Iast month.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.296
Everything seemed
in order.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.397
It's a standard form.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.806
She could have bought it
at any stationery store
and forged it.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.207
Okay.
Is there a father?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.041
No. Not in any
of the paperwork.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.341
Must be out of the picture.

05:48.414 --> 05:51.212
What about an emergency
contact number
or a place where she works?

05:51.284 --> 05:55.015
No. Just a home number
but I know she has a job.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.056
Luis takes Miguel
to a youth center

05:57.123 --> 05:59.751
on Essex Street
every day after school.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.556
Thank you.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.627
PENZA: Miguel and Luis
are regulars.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.926
We try to keep
these Iatchkey kids

06:06.999 --> 06:08.694
off the street
and out of trouble.

06:08.768 --> 06:09.928
How did it happen?

06:10.002 --> 06:11.299
That's what
we're trying to find out.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.929
Are there any friends
that we can talk to?

06:13.005 --> 06:13.994
Yeah.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.700
Hey, Kevin?

06:15.775 --> 06:17.640
Take over for a minute.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.240
McDONALD: What's up,
Mr. Penza?

06:20.313 --> 06:22.247
These detectives need
some information.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.112
This is Kevin McDonald,
he's one of our counselors.

06:24.183 --> 06:25.172
McDONALD:
How can I help you?

06:25.251 --> 06:26.718
Tell us about
the Ramos brothers.

06:26.786 --> 06:27.946
Two great kids.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.920
Luis is one step away
from his red belt.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.184
He's got a mean
flying side kick.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.158
You ever see
their mother
pick them up from school?

06:34.227 --> 06:37.196
Yeah. She was here yesterday.
Comes by once a week.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.595
The rest of the time, Luis
is more Iike Miguel's father.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.496
Makes sure nobody
messes with him.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.535
Anybody know
where they Iive?

06:43.603 --> 06:47.039
I walked Miguel home one night
when Luis was out sick.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.906
BENSON:
Nobody named Ramos on here,

06:51.978 --> 06:53.741
STABLER:
I Iived in a building
for four years,

06:53.813 --> 06:55.440
never put my name
on the buzzer.

06:55.515 --> 06:56.539
I'II ring the super.

06:56.616 --> 07:00.052
Liv,
what's that Iook Iike?

07:00.119 --> 07:01.108
Ricochet mark.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.655
Goes all the way
down the building.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.850
Shooter either got him
going into the building...

07:05.925 --> 07:08.359
Or coming out.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.230
There's no blood
on the stoop
or the sidewalk

07:12.732 --> 07:14.632
STABLER: I don't see
any blood on the walls.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.328
Doesn't Iook Iike
there's any
in the street, either.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.496
But there's some
over here.

07:22.909 --> 07:26.538
Trajectory of the slugs
show the weapon
was fired at a Iow angle.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.102
Someone crouching down
across the street?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.944
Yeah.
More Iikely a drive-by.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.745
We found more slugs
than shells.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.911
So some of the shells
might've ejected
into this car.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.283
Or rolled into the sewer.

07:35.354 --> 07:36.651
That's not all.

07:36.722 --> 07:40.317
Angles of the slug marks
on the building
get more and more blunt

07:40.393 --> 07:43.794
from the stoop to the alley,
so the car had to stop.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.491
BENSON: So the shooter
fired at somebody
coming out of the building,

07:46.566 --> 07:47.965
then escaped
into that alley.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.968
Might explain these.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.660
Skid marks.

07:51.737 --> 07:52.761
Yeah,
and they're fresh ones.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.707
Stopped the car, peeled out,
he Ieft that behind.
Sideswiped him.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.978
Silver car, black paint.

08:00.346 --> 08:01.677
AIso fresh.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.604
Peter,
get a shot of this.

08:03.683 --> 08:04.672
PETER: Got it.

08:04.784 --> 08:05.944
We'II get
the chemistry set out,

08:06.018 --> 08:08.111
match the paint
to the manufacturer.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.655
How Iong before you get us
a make and model on that car?

08:10.723 --> 08:13.214
For you two,
give me a day.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.321
BENSON:
Any Iuck on the canvass?

08:15.394 --> 08:17.624
Hear no evil, see no evil.
Zero witnesses.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.528
We found
the kids' apartment.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.499
They Iive
with Grandma.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.468
Last night when I came home,
the boys weren't here,

08:24.537 --> 08:28.564
so I thought maybe Maria took
Luis and Miguel for the night.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.735
Well, they Iive here,
but Maria doesn't?

08:31.811 --> 08:34.905
Last month,
she shows up at my door

08:34.981 --> 08:37.313
and asks me
to take care of the boys.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.139
(SOBBING)

08:39.919 --> 08:43.548
It was the second time
that I see them in two years.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.059
BENSON:
Where is Maria staying?

08:47.126 --> 08:48.855
I don't know where.

08:48.928 --> 08:51.089
With some friends.

08:51.163 --> 08:53.529
But she said that
it was temporary

08:53.599 --> 08:55.931
until she find a place
of her own.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.596
Why would anyone
want to harm them?

09:00.139 --> 09:03.336
Last year, Maria called me.

09:03.409 --> 09:06.537
She was arrested...
with drugs

09:07.313 --> 09:09.338
I gave her the bail money,

09:09.415 --> 09:13.442
because she told me
that her boyfriend
could never find out.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.544
When she came here
with my grandsons,

09:15.621 --> 09:17.987
I asked her if she was
back with the drugs

09:18.057 --> 09:21.117
and she swore to me
that it was all behind her.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.657
But I knew
she was in trouble.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.891
Maria's boyfriend,
do you know where he Iives?

09:26.966 --> 09:29.366
In the Bronx.
They Iive together.

09:30.169 --> 09:31.602
We'II need that address.

09:31.671 --> 09:35.232
You said that you tried
to reach Maria,
but you couldn't.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.105
This is her telephone number
where she works,

09:40.446 --> 09:42.038
some restaurant,

09:43.916 --> 09:45.941
in case the boys got sick.

09:48.454 --> 09:51.218
Two other detectives
were here yesterday
asking about Maria.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.019
Don't you people communicate
with each other?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.253
That would be
much too efficient
for a bureaucracy Iike ours.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.886
The detectives say
where they were from?

09:56.963 --> 09:58.328
No, but they were
undercover.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.194
Looked more Iike
drug dealers than cops.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.290
FIN: What did you tell them?

10:01.367 --> 10:02.527
MANAGER:
Maria had a day off.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.591
I didn't know
where she was.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.068
She scheduled
to work here today?

10:05.137 --> 10:07.332
She didn't show up.
Not Iike her at all.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.000
Hard worker, good attitude,
until today.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.941
But if she don't call me,
I got to Iet her go.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.808
MUNCH: She seem uneasy
about anything Iately?

10:13.879 --> 10:16.643
Yeah, two days ago,
she was working the grill.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.775
Some customer comes in
and calls her by name.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.512
She makes Iike
she doesn't even
know the guy,

10:20.586 --> 10:21.610
and then she said
she was sick,

10:21.687 --> 10:22.881
(PHONE RINGING)
and she had to go home.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.354
Okay, if you see her...

10:24.724 --> 10:27.591
Yeah, don't worry,
I have her paycheck.
She'II call me.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.649
Hello?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.129
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

10:34.100 --> 10:35.089
Yes?

10:35.167 --> 10:36.691
Police.
I'm Detective Stabler.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.101
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.
You are?

10:39.171 --> 10:40.468
Fredo Garcia.
How can I help you?

10:40.539 --> 10:43.064
We're here
about your family.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.337
Did something
happen to them?

10:47.513 --> 10:48.775
BENSON:
When were they Iast here?

10:48.848 --> 10:50.247
About a month ago.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.513
I was away on business.
Came back, they were gone.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.614
Can you tell me
what this is about?

10:56.689 --> 10:57.849
Miguel was hurt.

10:57.923 --> 10:59.982
Did she do it?

11:00.059 --> 11:01.526
Why would you say that?

11:01.594 --> 11:03.960
Maria has a crazy temper.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.696
I came home one night,
she was hitting Miguel.

11:06.766 --> 11:09.599
I warned her
if she did it again,
I'd call the cops.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.796
I guess
that's why she Ieft.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.466
But you didn't
report them missing?

11:13.539 --> 11:16.667
I Iooked for them myself.
Didn't have any Iuck.

11:16.742 --> 11:20.576
She wanted to Ieave me.
I figured, what am I
gonna do to stop her?

11:20.646 --> 11:21.874
BENSON: How Iong
were you two together?

11:21.947 --> 11:22.971
Two years.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.779
And she gave you
no indication where
she might've gone?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.978
Didn't even Ieave a note.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.112
If you find them,
would you tell them

11:31.190 --> 11:33.249
I'd Iike her and the boys
to come back?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.859
Sure will.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.958
He's so concerned
that Maria beat Miguel

11:43.035 --> 11:45.629
but doesn't ask
what happened to him.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.139
Wonder what Fredo
does for a Iiving.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.368
Somebody's dealing
out of here.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.877
Could explain
Maria's drug problem.

11:52.945 --> 11:56.244
Last year Maria was
busted with a dozen
dime bags of heroin

11:56.315 --> 11:57.612
and $1,000 cash.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.378
Possession
with intent to sell.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.942
First offense,
D.A. knocked it down.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.817
She did a year
on probation.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.651
None of this jibes
with a woman

12:04.724 --> 12:07.192
slinging burgers
to support her kids.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.989
We figure out their movements
the day of the shooting?

12:10.062 --> 12:13.623
The kids went to school
and the youth center as usual.

12:13.699 --> 12:16.862
Maria picked them up.
We don't know where
she was before that.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.166
Yeah, we're thinking
they all went
to Maria's mother's place,

12:19.238 --> 12:20.933
even though
it was just Miguel
who got shot.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.668
From there,
they ran the three blocks
to the hospital.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.967
CRAGEN: Well, what about
the ex-boyfriend?

12:26.045 --> 12:27.376
Munch is running
a rap sheet on him now.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.209
Now Fredo's story is,

12:29.281 --> 12:32.011
Maria Ieft because
he threatened
to call the cops on her

12:32.084 --> 12:33.073
for beating up
her boys.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.813
Maybe Miguel can tell us
what happened.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.287
He's asking
for his mother.

12:38.891 --> 12:39.949
BENSON: What's going on?

12:40.025 --> 12:42.016
Doctor told me
not to say anything.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.493
What happened?

12:43.562 --> 12:45.120
Miguel is dead.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.093
They just told us
that he was awake.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.657
Complications from surgery?

12:49.735 --> 12:52.431
Pillow over his face.
He was smothered.

12:58.511 --> 13:03.278
I was checking his vitals.
He was stable, awake, alert.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.113
I walked out
to get a peds
blood pressure cuff.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.244
I was only gone five minutes.
AII right.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.344
Now, when you were
in there

13:09.421 --> 13:11.719
did Miguel say anything
about the shooting?

13:12.691 --> 13:14.454
He asked for his mother
and his brother, that's all.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.789
Okay,
think really hard.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.853
You remember seeing
any strangers on the floor?

13:18.931 --> 13:22.924
Just some visitors
and a maintenance man.

13:24.236 --> 13:25.260
Oh, my God.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.326
What?

13:26.405 --> 13:28.430
The maintenance guy.

13:28.507 --> 13:32.170
He passed the Nurses' Station
as I was going back to Miguel.

13:32.244 --> 13:35.839
I said, "Hi"
and he just kept walking.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.246
Someone I haven't seen before.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.251
Can you describe to us
what he Iooks Iike?

13:40.319 --> 13:44.949
Hispanic, average height,
dark hair.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.289
Okay. We'II need you
to describe him
to a sketch artist.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.349
I'II tell my boss.

13:49.428 --> 13:50.588
Good.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.727
Let's go.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.959
Pair of patrols found
a maintenance worker's uniform

13:57.036 --> 13:58.526
in the men's room
on the first floor.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.868
Nurse saw him
just before
she found Miguel.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.737
Does the mother's
ex-boyfriend
Iook good for this?

14:02.808 --> 14:04.742
We'II have the nurse
work with the sketch artist.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.370
AII right, Iook,
I want everybody
who works in this hospital

14:07.446 --> 14:08.470
interviewed quick.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.414
Miguel's mother and brother
could be next.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.053
Look Iike you could
use some caffeine.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.114
Twelve-hour sack time
would be a Iot better.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.921
Sketch of your guy.

14:23.229 --> 14:24.491
Anything back
from the Iab, yet?

14:24.563 --> 14:26.326
Dozens of prints taken
from the hospital room.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.491
No word yet
if it matches anyone
in our system.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.091
Results are in
of the sideswiped car

14:30.169 --> 14:31.466
from the scene
of the drive-by.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.062
Your shooter drove
a black '98 Lexus.

14:34.139 --> 14:37.506
Must be a couple
of thousand of those
in the Tri-State Area.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.601
Why don't you guys
catch an hour or two
up in the crib?

14:39.678 --> 14:40.667
We'II cover for you.

14:40.746 --> 14:41.940
Thanks.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.038
It's gonna have to wait.

14:43.115 --> 14:44.139
What's the problem?

14:44.216 --> 14:47.845
That was Maria Ramos' boss.
She's going to
pick up her check.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.161
Manager just gave me
the heads up.

14:58.397 --> 15:02.265
Wake up call,
she's at the counter.
Neither did we.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.323
What?

15:03.402 --> 15:05.893
OIivia said
she didn't see her coming in.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.336
Who's that?

15:10.209 --> 15:11.540
MUNCH: Not Maria.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.409
On the way out.
Leather jacket.
Orange pants.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.245
We got her.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.227
You want us
to take her?

15:30.296 --> 15:32.491
No, not yet. Let's see
where she Ieads us.

15:35.301 --> 15:38.065
Looks Iike she's heading
for the bus stop.

16:17.943 --> 16:21.242
You think she's just
bringing that check to Maria?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.508
Think that'd be too easy.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.387
Hey, Luis.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.452
Luis. Let's go.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.186
COLON: Leave him alone!
Let go of me.

16:38.263 --> 16:39.855
I didn't do anything.
BENSON:
Luis, you're not in trouble.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.422
Listen to me, we're cops.
We're here to help you.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.694
What's going on here?

16:42.768 --> 16:43.792
Let's start
with your real name.

16:43.869 --> 16:44.858
Annie Colon.

16:44.937 --> 16:49.465
Annie Colon,
why are you picking up
Maria Ramos' paycheck?

16:49.541 --> 16:51.202
She asked me to.
Where is she?

16:51.276 --> 16:54.370
I don't know.
She slept on my couch
for the Iast week.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.437
Then Iast night
she said she had to Ieave,

16:56.515 --> 16:58.073
told me to
give her check to Luis.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.310
You Iying to us?

16:59.385 --> 17:01.012
I'm telling the truth,
I swear.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.020
Luis,
where's your mother?

17:03.989 --> 17:05.923
That's a tough guy,
he doesn't wanna work with us.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.617
I'II tell you what,
you want to play it that way?

17:07.693 --> 17:08.751
Let go of me.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.317
What are you doing?
BENSON: We're taking him in.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.159
No!
For what?
He's 10 years old!

17:12.231 --> 17:13.289
He's truant.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.798
LUIS: Stop. Let go.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.934
Luis, we wanna help you.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.705
But you have
to help us, too.

17:28.247 --> 17:31.546
Why was your mom scared
to pick up her own paycheck?

17:33.685 --> 17:37.121
STABLER:
You Ieft your Iittle brother
in the hospital, why?

17:37.189 --> 17:39.020
Did you see Miguel?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.524
Yeah, we saw him.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.462
Now, Iook, we know
you and your mom
are in trouble,

17:44.530 --> 17:48.364
and we wanna protect you,
but we've got
to talk to her first.

17:59.611 --> 18:03.138
Luis, tell us where
you and your mom are staying.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.383
No. I'm not telling you.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.081
That kid's hanging tough.

18:12.157 --> 18:13.181
Can we hold him?

18:13.258 --> 18:14.282
For cutting class?

18:14.359 --> 18:16.657
As a material witness.
We know he saw something.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.821
We put him in the system,
they put him
in juvenile detention,

18:18.897 --> 18:20.524
which just
terrifies him further.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.999
He didn't do anything.
Let's try harder.

18:23.735 --> 18:26.295
Poor kid doesn't even know
about his brother.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.963
Luis have anything on him?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.268
A few bucks,
slip of paper

18:29.341 --> 18:30.501
with the word "Liberty"
written on it,

18:30.576 --> 18:31.634
a school subway pass,

18:31.710 --> 18:32.938
and transit says
most trips

18:33.011 --> 18:34.740
originate from
the Lawrence Street Station.

18:34.813 --> 18:37.281
N and R trains in Brooklyn,
near the Fulton Mall.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.146
They could be
staying near there.

18:39.218 --> 18:40.708
CRAGEN: Then that's where
we Iook for Maria.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.085
Start with every place
that has Liberty
in the name.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.456
Haven't seen anyone
Iike that around here.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.489
Anyone move into the building
in the Iast few days?

18:52.564 --> 18:55.124
No. No new tenants
in six months.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.667
Okay. Thanks.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.633
We've been to
Liberty Apartments,
Liberty Hotel.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.675
There's a Liberty Avenue exit
off the Van Wyck in Queens.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.471
You know,
this is gonna take us
at Ieast a month.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.102
Maria must be going
out of her mind

19:07.179 --> 19:09.443
wondering why Luis
hasn't come home.

19:09.515 --> 19:10.539
What's next on the Iist?

19:10.616 --> 19:11.640
Liberty Knick Knacks.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.708
If Liberty's not
the name of the place
where she's staying,

19:13.785 --> 19:16.549
well, maybe it's where
she's got a new job.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.325
I'm not seeing anybody.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.862
Right there.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.625
BENSON: Maria.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.527
Go down that aisle.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.461
Can I help you?

19:34.540 --> 19:35.564
Maria Ramos?

19:35.641 --> 19:37.438
You get away from me.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.942
Calm down, Maria.
We're the police.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.137
We need you
to come with us.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.474
Why? Why?

19:42.281 --> 19:44.146
You Ieft Miguel
in the hospital.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.878
Well, I had to.
What's wrong?

19:47.953 --> 19:49.887
My baby,
is he okay?

19:50.222 --> 19:51.280
Let's talk privately.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.483
No, no, no, tell me.
What's going on?

19:53.559 --> 19:55.186
Well, tell me,
how is my baby?

19:55.260 --> 19:56.818
Miguel's dead.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.728
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

19:59.798 --> 20:01.390
He's fine.
He's in a good hospital.

20:01.466 --> 20:02.455
We're sorry, Maria.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.970
No, no, no! You're wrong.
You're so wrong. He's fine.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.671
The doctor told me
he was gonna be okay.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.798
Why don't we
talk somewhere else?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.900
No. PIease, please.

20:12.578 --> 20:13.704
Sorry.

20:13.779 --> 20:18.079
No, you're not sorry.
You never help us. Stop it!

20:23.555 --> 20:25.284
Does Luis know about Miguel?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.415
BENSON:
We haven't said anything yet.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.118
MARIA: Where is he?
I have to tell him.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.558
He's here. Safe.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.993
Let me see him.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.697
Maria, Luis is going
to a shelter

20:33.765 --> 20:35.665
until we can place him
in a foster home.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.793
You can't take him
away from me. He's my son.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.996
BENSON: So was Miguel,
but where were you
when he needed you?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.835
I Ioved him.
It's a hell of a way
to show it,

20:41.907 --> 20:44.842
Ieaving him
in that hospital
Iike that.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.878
I thought
he would be safe there.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.105
From the person
who shot him,

20:48.180 --> 20:49.807
or whoever used him
as a punching bag?

20:49.881 --> 20:52.349
STABLER: Healed fractures
in both arms and ribs.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.543
He had a broken nose.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.883
His jaw was cracked twice.

20:55.954 --> 20:56.943
Was it you?

20:57.022 --> 20:59.217
I never Iaid a hand
on my kids.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.593
Her word against his.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.288
Whose word?
STABLER: Fredo.

21:04.363 --> 21:08.595
You talked to Fredo?
He knows I'm here?
He knows Luis is here?

21:08.767 --> 21:10.997
How did Fredo
treat your kids?

21:12.137 --> 21:13.627
He Ioved them.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.836
BENSON: So why don't
you want us to talk to him?

21:20.445 --> 21:21.810
Maria,
someone beat up your boy.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.713
Now if it's not you,
then it must be Fredo.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.611
You've got to stop
covering for him.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.183
We can protect you and Luis.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.724
You just don't get it.
I can't.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.228
CABOT: Fredo has her spooked.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.464
How many times
have we seen this,
Counselor?

21:46.538 --> 21:48.597
Woman trapped
in a violent relationship

21:48.674 --> 21:50.232
and doesn't want
to press charges.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.573
Yeah, but she Ieft him.
That takes courage.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.135
And no doubt
pissed off the bastard.

21:55.213 --> 21:58.114
CRAGEN:
Now he wants revenge,
so he shoots her kid.

21:58.183 --> 21:59.980
But he doesn't count
on Miguel surviving,

22:00.052 --> 22:02.418
so he sends somebody
to the hospital
to shut him up.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.546
That seems pretty extreme
for a family squabble.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.818
Unless that's not
all this is.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.086
John, any Iuck?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.025
No rap sheet
under the name
Fredo Garcia.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.722
Check with Narcotics
Task Force.

22:11.797 --> 22:13.594
If this guy's a player,
they got to know about him.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.791
I just got off the phone
with them.

22:14.866 --> 22:17.334
I asked about Fredo,
guy says they never
even heard of him.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.494
Then he starts
questioning me

22:18.570 --> 22:19.901
Iike he doesn't think
I'm a cop.

22:19.971 --> 22:20.960
The only thing
he didn't ask me

22:21.039 --> 22:22.506
was whether I wear
boxers or briefs.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.371
Sounds Iike
they know something
they don't wanna share.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.468
I'II call my office
and see if anybody
knows anything.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.534
Thanks.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.676
Any other back doors
we can open?

22:29.748 --> 22:31.773
Fin bolted
a couple of minutes ago,
didn't say where.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.215
That usually means
a covert meeting

22:33.285 --> 22:35.947
with one of his operatives
in the drug netherworld.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.784
What did Maria say?
Nothing.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.086
We're gonna have
to talk to Luis.

22:40.158 --> 22:43.059
Let me take a run at him.
I speak 10-year-old.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.459
AII right.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.065
You didn't finish.
Was the burger okay?

22:53.572 --> 22:54.630
Full.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.999
Sorry. I didn't mean
to treat you Iike a baby.

22:57.075 --> 22:59.566
Just the way
I was brought up.

22:59.845 --> 23:02.814
My mom, you know,
she'd kind of
hover over me.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.748
Just the opposite of you
and your mother.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.042
What do you mean?

23:09.121 --> 23:10.588
When I was your age,
I wasn't allowed

23:10.655 --> 23:12.282
to ride my bike
around the corner.

23:12.357 --> 23:15.019
You, you pick up
your Iittle brother
at school every day,

23:15.093 --> 23:16.219
ride the subway alone.

23:16.294 --> 23:18.387
You're a pretty
independent guy.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.057
Yeah, someone's got to do it.

23:21.967 --> 23:25.198
I have a Iot of respect
for you, Luis.
I Iive by myself.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.828
I only have myself
to worry about.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.999
You take care
of your mother,
your brother.

23:33.111 --> 23:34.840
I didn't do that too well.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.574
What makes you say that?

23:36.648 --> 23:39.208
Miguel got shot.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.342
That's not your fault.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.545
Yes, it is.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.081
My stomach hurts.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.592
You don't have
to be scared, Luis.

23:49.194 --> 23:50.525
I don't want
to talk about it.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.393
Talking can be good.
Make you feel better.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.725
It'II get you into trouble.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.030
You don't have to keep
everything to yourself.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.629
He'II hurt my mom
if I say anything.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.133
Luis, Iook at me.

24:05.343 --> 24:08.312
Your mom turns to you
for help, doesn't she?

24:09.714 --> 24:11.306
We take care of each other.

24:11.383 --> 24:14.409
I'm a detective. I want
to take care of you, too.

24:14.486 --> 24:17.114
I can't do that
unless you talk to me.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.283
But I promised her
I wouldn't.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.989
Your mom's confused, Luis.
She needs your help.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.633
You can't protect her
unless you tell me
what Fredo did.

24:36.908 --> 24:40.275
I saw one of Fredo's men

24:42.447 --> 24:45.041
in the car where
the shots came from.

24:48.119 --> 24:49.586
What do you want
with me anyhow?

24:49.654 --> 24:51.417
Fredo Garcia
mean anything to you?

24:51.490 --> 24:52.821
You trying to get me killed?
I'm out of here.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.552
Don't move.

24:54.626 --> 24:56.821
If the guy's in the trade,
why don't I know
anything about him?

24:56.895 --> 24:59.455
He's new,
since you stopped
being a narc.

24:59.531 --> 25:01.590
Keeps a Iow profile,
my own personal mantra.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.133
Here's my mantra.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.465
I scratched your back,
now I got a major itch.

25:05.537 --> 25:06.834
Unless you want
to be keeping a Iow profile

25:06.905 --> 25:08.805
in some cell in Rikers.

25:08.874 --> 25:09.966
You got to watch my back.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.201
Talk!

25:13.111 --> 25:15.602
Two years, Fredo's got
the dope market cornered.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.669
How?

25:16.748 --> 25:18.978
By killing off
the Iocal competition.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.984
Joey Stapleton
was the main supplier
in the Bronx

25:21.052 --> 25:22.679
till Fredo capped him.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.221
How'd he take over
the building?

25:24.289 --> 25:26.382
He hears we had this talk,
I'm a dead man.

25:26.458 --> 25:30.019
Listen, the evidence
I have on you
is good for two years.

25:31.296 --> 25:34.390
He forced out
some of the tenants
and paid off the rest.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.093
Moved in with some woman
and her kids.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.032
It's a nice Iittle front
for him.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.695
I wouldn't want
to be that bitch
right now, though.

25:39.771 --> 25:40.931
Why not?

25:41.006 --> 25:42.871
Word is,
he's got a hit out on her.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.075
For ratting him out
to you cops.

25:48.947 --> 25:50.915
Fin's guy says
Fredo charmed his way

25:50.982 --> 25:53.416
into Maria's Iife,
into her apartment.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.680
He used
the whole damn building
for his drug business.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.917
BENSON:
While the rest of his rats
crawl around the city.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.480
We're ready.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.890
BENSON: Let's do it.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.954
It may be the only way
to nail Fredo.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.190
How's Miguel?

26:10.268 --> 26:11.860
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

26:14.072 --> 26:15.096
No!

26:15.574 --> 26:16.734
MARIA:
It's not your fault, Mijito.

26:16.808 --> 26:18.173
No,

26:18.243 --> 26:21.508
It's Fredo's fault,
I told them,

26:21.580 --> 26:23.480
No, no, no!
Tell them you lied,

26:23.548 --> 26:26.574
Tell them!
Please, he takes it back,

26:26.885 --> 26:31.481
He's a child, You tricked him,
You made him tell you lies,

26:31.556 --> 26:32.545
Mom!

26:32.624 --> 26:33.852
Luis, please,
listen to me,

26:33.925 --> 26:37.827
No, Mommy, tell them,
Tell them it was Fredo,

26:37.896 --> 26:39.488
Don't be afraid,

26:41.600 --> 26:43.090
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

26:50.976 --> 26:53.672
STABLER: Fredo's not just
some jealous Iover Maria's
trying to escape from.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.475
He happens to be
one of the city's
biggest drug Iords.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.675
As Iong as she and Luis
are breathing,
they're in danger.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.377
We can keep them
in protective custody.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.215
Safest bet
is to get them
out of town.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.619
I need them here
to prep the case,
go before the grand jury.

27:04.689 --> 27:05.678
Now we're talking
about a hotel.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.486
We got no budget
for witness protection.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.959
Any chance the D.A.'s office
can pony up the bucks?

27:10.028 --> 27:12.462
You know how it works.
You pay before indictment,
we pay after.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.397
Come on, 1PP's down
our throats on money
ever since the attacks.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.401
Help us out here.
I'II see what I can do.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.528
In the meantime,
try to find someplace
that isn't The PIaza.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.037
What about
Miguel's funeral?

27:21.106 --> 27:22.300
Crime Victims Board
will pay.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.069
And we do the arrangements.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.043
Find a church as far away
from her neighborhood
as you possibly can.

27:27.112 --> 27:30.104
Immediate family
and us only.

27:35.553 --> 27:36.952
MARIA:
I was in love with Fredo,

27:38.390 --> 27:40.255
He was wonderful.

27:41.893 --> 27:45.090
Until I came home
from work one night.

27:45.163 --> 27:48.894
He was at my kitchen table
with his friends,
cutting heroin.

27:49.234 --> 27:50.929
Where were the boys?

27:51.002 --> 27:52.435
Watching them.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.866
I told Fredo to stop,
and he hits me with his gun

27:55.940 --> 28:00.104
and tells me
to never embarrass him
in front of his friends.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.545
Later he apologized and said
he wouldn't do it again.

28:04.282 --> 28:06.147
It usually gets worse.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.448
He started to beat
Miguel and Luis, too.

28:13.391 --> 28:15.882
Then he would beg us
to forgive him.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.456
Bring us presents

28:19.931 --> 28:22.593
and promise
he will never do it again.

28:23.234 --> 28:24.861
Until the next time.

28:24.936 --> 28:28.372
Maria, did you ever
try to Ieave before now?

28:30.642 --> 28:33.907
I had no place to go,
no money.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.741
He would only give me
enough to buy food

28:35.814 --> 28:38.544
and spend the rest on himself
and other women.

28:38.616 --> 28:41.710
But, Maria,
you were arrested for drugs.

28:41.786 --> 28:43.014
Were you using?

28:43.088 --> 28:44.180
I never used.

28:44.856 --> 28:47.017
Never.
Fredo degraded me.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.226
He made me carry his drugs
inside of me

28:49.294 --> 28:51.353
so the police
wouldn't find them,

28:51.429 --> 28:53.226
forced my boys to run drugs,

28:53.298 --> 28:56.597
told me he would kill them
if we didn't do
as we were told.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.693
But you stayed.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.362
Something must have
made you realize

29:00.438 --> 29:02.599
that you had
to get away from him.

29:02.674 --> 29:06.337
One day,
Fredo took Luis' baseball bat

29:06.411 --> 29:09.812
and beat a man unconscious
while Luis and I watched.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.817
I knew we could be next.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.587
Your boss at the restaurant
said that somebody
recognized you.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.583
That's how Fredo
found you, isn't it?

29:21.659 --> 29:23.786
It was the man
I delivered the dope to.

29:24.562 --> 29:27.087
He runs Fredo's operation
in Brooklyn.

29:27.165 --> 29:28.189
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

29:28.266 --> 29:29.255
STABLER: Everybody decent?

29:29.334 --> 29:30.824
Yeah, come in.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.670
You Iook so handsome.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.436
We ready?

29:38.610 --> 29:39.577
Yeah.

29:51.322 --> 29:52.914
PRIEST:
We'II start in just a moment.

29:52.991 --> 29:54.390
Gracias, Father.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.091
BENSON:
What are they doing here?

30:01.166 --> 30:02.428
Said it couldn't wait.

30:02.500 --> 30:03.524
Detectives Milton...

30:03.601 --> 30:04.659
And Tatum, yeah,
from the Bronx.

30:04.736 --> 30:05.725
What's the problem?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.271
She didn't tell you?

30:07.338 --> 30:08.498
BENSON: Tell us what?
Oh, my God.

30:08.573 --> 30:09.835
She and her son Miguel
witnessed Fredo Garcia

30:09.908 --> 30:11.739
off one of his competitors,

30:11.810 --> 30:13.175
a dealer named
Joey Stapleton.

30:13.244 --> 30:16.338
I mean, she came to us,
but disappeared before
we got her statement.

30:16.414 --> 30:19.474
Fredo's men follow you,
and that's how he found me.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.452
Maria, it's time to start
telling the truth.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.255
Yes, we did see it.

30:27.892 --> 30:31.623
We saw how Fredo
killed that man,
and I did call the police.

30:33.398 --> 30:36.595
But I run when they said
I had to testify in court.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.226
I couldn't face Fredo.

30:38.303 --> 30:39.292
(GUNSHOT)

30:39.637 --> 30:41.832
FIN: Down! Down! Maria's hit!

30:42.173 --> 30:43.902
Shots came from the back.
Stay with them!

30:43.975 --> 30:47.536
10-30. We got shots
fired at the church
on Broadway and 177.

30:47.612 --> 30:50.410
We got a civilian down.
We need an ambulance now.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.551
(SIRENS BLARING)

30:57.722 --> 30:58.984
Police! Freeze!

30:59.057 --> 31:00.786
Show us your hands!

31:02.327 --> 31:04.693
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands!

31:13.504 --> 31:15.665
BIack Lexus
with silver paint scrapings.

31:15.740 --> 31:18.106
I've been Iooking
for one of these.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.076
BENSON: Look at this.

31:20.979 --> 31:23.106
It's good enough
to fool the manager
at Maria's restaurant.

31:23.181 --> 31:25.149
STABLER:
Where'd you get that?
Shove it.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.240
I'm sorry?

31:26.317 --> 31:27.545
Shove it.

31:27.685 --> 31:29.243
You know something?

31:29.320 --> 31:32.881
Running your mouth Iike that,
you're gonna wish
you'd shot me.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.092
What's your answer now?

31:35.159 --> 31:37.184
No answer. Come on.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.457
How bad?
She got it in the arm.

31:39.530 --> 31:41.862
Okay, Iet's get her
out of here.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.931
MAN: This way
over here, please.

31:44.202 --> 31:47.865
You can't keep us safe.
You can't help us.

31:48.006 --> 31:49.598
We will never be safe.

31:52.143 --> 31:53.235
Go.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.679
MUNCH:
Do you recognize anyone?

32:01.085 --> 32:02.279
NURSE: Number three.

32:02.353 --> 32:04.150
Where do you
recognize him from?

32:04.222 --> 32:06.690
He's the one I saw passing
the Nurses' Station

32:06.758 --> 32:09.386
wearing the
maintenance man's uniform.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.121
He killed Miguel Ramos.

32:11.195 --> 32:12.992
You didn't see him
kill anyone.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.725
We're not in court.

32:15.633 --> 32:17.191
Thank you.
Thanks.

32:24.175 --> 32:25.642
CABOT: Maria's turn.

32:37.755 --> 32:40.588
Number three.
His name is Eddie Fuentes.

32:41.159 --> 32:43.491
FIN: Where do you
recognize him from?

32:43.962 --> 32:46.556
He works for Fredo.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.691
I saw him driving the car
when Miguel was shot.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.133
Driving? He wasn't
one of the shooters?

32:52.203 --> 32:54.068
You can't Iead her
Iike that.

32:54.138 --> 32:58.871
Okay, Maria,
if Fuentes was driving,
who shot Miguel?

32:59.877 --> 33:03.108
Fredo. From the back seat
of the car.

33:07.085 --> 33:10.612
My client wishes to exercise
his right to remain silent.

33:10.688 --> 33:14.249
He'd better say something
if he has any hope
of staying alive.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.314
Staying alive?

33:15.393 --> 33:17.293
Miguel was
a murder witness.

33:17.362 --> 33:20.354
Killing him in that hospital
means a needle in your arm,
Eddie.

33:20.431 --> 33:21.830
You can't prove
I did that.

33:21.899 --> 33:24.925
Moron, we got a witness
places you 10 feet
from Miguel's room

33:25.003 --> 33:27.699
just before they found him
with a pillow over his face.

33:27.772 --> 33:30.036
Your '98 black Lexus
Ieft skid marks

33:30.108 --> 33:31.939
and paint scrapings
at the scene of the crime.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.911
STABLER: And we matched
the slug in Miguel to the one
you put in his mother.

33:34.979 --> 33:37.379
That's attempted murder
of another witness
and six cops.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.279
And if you think
the jury is going to care

33:39.350 --> 33:41.284
that nobody actually
saw you smother Miguel,

33:41.352 --> 33:43.616
I can assure you,
they won't.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.052
I don't talk for nothing.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.591
Murder one,
Iife without parole.

33:47.658 --> 33:48.682
What kind of deal is that?

33:48.760 --> 33:50.489
CABOT: The kind that
keeps you breathing.

33:50.561 --> 33:54.258
You give us Fredo,
we take the death penalty
off the table.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.058
(WHISPERING)

34:04.642 --> 34:06.439
You gotta protect me.

34:06.511 --> 34:08.706
We'II keep you
out of the general pop.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.650
Fredo...
It was all his idea.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.581
I told him he was crazy,

34:16.654 --> 34:19.179
that doing the kid
in the hospital
was too risky.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.985
Why'd he want Miguel dead?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.027
Miguel and Maria.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.824
They saw him
whack Joey Stapleton.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.530
Fredo gave me
60,000 to hit them.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.692
How did you find Maria
and her boys?

34:30.768 --> 34:33.235
First time,
we followed her
to the diner

34:33.304 --> 34:34.896
where she met
those two cops.

34:35.672 --> 34:39.335
We Iost her when she split,
so we followed the cops.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.434
(CHUCKLES)

34:40.511 --> 34:42.842
They Ied us
right to the church.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.806
Followed us?
That's crap.

34:47.217 --> 34:50.187
Fuentes Iies
and the deal's off.
He's Iooking at death row.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.721
Even he's not that stupid.

34:51.789 --> 34:52.915
We need to
interview him.

34:52.989 --> 34:56.357
No, he's our catch.
He already rolled on Fredo
for your case.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.327
Now, who told you
that we had Maria?

34:58.396 --> 35:01.593
Narcotics Task Force said
you were asking questions.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.861
Someone in your own squad
told us about the funeral.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.460
And your going there
almost cost us Maria and Luis.

35:06.537 --> 35:09.870
Not to mention
four of my detectives
and your own sorry asses.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.568
Come on,
Iet us talk to the girl.

35:11.642 --> 35:14.076
You want in,
you follow my orders.

35:14.712 --> 35:17.146
BENSON: Did you go
to Maria's hotel first?

35:17.915 --> 35:19.212
Before the church.

35:19.283 --> 35:22.912
Which means Fredo could know
we have Maria and Luis there.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.317
We gotta move them.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.687
You wanna talk to Maria?

35:27.758 --> 35:29.248
We work together
to protect her,

35:29.327 --> 35:32.160
and you two just drew
the graveyard shift.

35:34.031 --> 35:35.225
MARIA: Where's this new hotel?

35:35.299 --> 35:36.493
Rockland County.

35:36.567 --> 35:37.898
You can't take us there.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.529
I don't drive,
and we'II be trapped
in that hotel,

35:40.605 --> 35:42.334
and Luis needs
to be in school.

35:42.406 --> 35:44.067
Maria, you're gonna
have to trust us.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.734
The only way that
we can keep you safe

35:45.810 --> 35:48.677
from Fredo's people
is to get you
out of this city.

35:48.746 --> 35:52.079
You have Eddie Fuentes.
Let Luis and me go.
I'II be back to testify.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.879
That's what you told
the other detectives

35:53.951 --> 35:55.851
before you ditched them
and took off.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.888
I did what I had to do
to protect my family.

35:57.955 --> 36:01.049
You almost
got yourself killed.
PIease, get in.

36:06.564 --> 36:10.125
I never should have
gone to those cops
or talked to you.

36:11.469 --> 36:15.530
We could have disappeared,
and Miguel would
still be alive.

36:17.942 --> 36:21.309
I killed my own son
because I didn't know
what to do.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.841
Let us help you.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.884
You can't help me.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.646
He could be
one of Fredo's people.

36:28.719 --> 36:31.745
Or him, or them, or anybody.

36:31.822 --> 36:32.948
You can't stop them.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.254
If you just work with us,
we can protect you.

36:35.326 --> 36:38.784
That's what
the other cops said
and Iook what happened.

36:41.098 --> 36:42.759
I'm not testifying
against Fredo.

36:42.833 --> 36:46.963
Listen to me,
as Iong as you're out there,
you're a threat to Fredo.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.332
He can't afford
to Ieave you alive.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.172
He'II never Ieave you alone.

36:53.277 --> 36:56.269
Now, you refuse to testify,
we'II subpoena you.

36:56.681 --> 36:58.672
If you still refuse
to testify, you go to jail

36:58.749 --> 37:01.115
and you Iose Luis
to a foster home.

37:01.185 --> 37:02.447
Then take him!

37:02.987 --> 37:06.218
Put him in someplace
where they can never find him.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.622
We can't Iive
Iike this anymore.

37:18.502 --> 37:19.491
CABOT: She has to testify.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.559
Well, you can't blame her.

37:20.638 --> 37:23.106
Fredo killed Miguel
because Maria talked
to the Bronx detectives.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.938
Maria doesn't nail him,
he wins.
You'd cut her Ioose?

37:26.010 --> 37:27.739
I'm just saying that
we're part of her problem.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.473
She thinks
that we're punishing her

37:29.547 --> 37:30.844
by making her
a moving target,

37:30.915 --> 37:32.007
and she's right.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.675
She's in more danger
having us around.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.185
Is there any way to do this
without Maria and Luis?

37:36.254 --> 37:39.985
They saw Fredo shoot Miguel.
Maria watched him
murder Joey Stapleton.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.490
CRAGEN: We have Eddie Fuentes.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.551
He's a co-conspirator.
Without corroboration,
I can't even indict.

37:44.629 --> 37:45.653
You know,
if we were the Feds,

37:45.730 --> 37:47.960
we could give her
a whole new identity,
new Iife.

37:48.032 --> 37:50.262
No honor among thieves.
Fuentes squealed Iike a pig.

37:50.334 --> 37:53.394
Gave up Fredo's operation
including the Iayout
of Fredo's crib

37:53.471 --> 37:55.234
complete with all
the escape routes.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.501
Maria's not talking
till we get Fredo
out of the picture.

37:57.575 --> 37:59.406
FIN: We'd better do it quick.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.241
They go to the
grandmother's house to get
Luis' asthma medicine.

38:02.313 --> 38:05.043
Luis fakes sick.
Maria and Luis
go into the bathroom,

38:05.116 --> 38:08.984
close the door behind them,
and Maria bolts out
the fire escape.

38:09.053 --> 38:10.918
Tatum and his partner
Iost her.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.548
Couple of square-badge
security guards
wouldn't have fallen for that.

38:13.624 --> 38:17.185
Yeah, we better pick up Fredo
before he finds out.

38:17.261 --> 38:19.286
Decision time,
Counselor.

38:24.068 --> 38:27.868
I'II wake up a judge.
The warrant will be
for the drugs only.

38:39.684 --> 38:40.844
What you want, man?

38:40.918 --> 38:43.113
Trying to get a taste,
player.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.217
4:00 in the morning, man,
we're closed.

38:45.289 --> 38:46.620
Open up.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.318
Yo, you rob for that?

38:48.392 --> 38:51.828
Do you really care?
You gonna turn down
this business?

38:55.232 --> 38:56.859
Yo, I've never
seen you before, man.

38:56.934 --> 38:59.801
I ain't never seen
you before, man. Come on.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.668
Inside. Follow me.

39:09.914 --> 39:12.439
You trying to take me off,
man? You in big trouble.

39:12.516 --> 39:16.179
Shut up. Police.
We're all clear.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.791
MAN:
Police! Don't move.

39:30.568 --> 39:31.557
(GUNSHOT)

39:31.635 --> 39:32.624
(SCREAM)

39:33.304 --> 39:34.293
Police.

39:35.072 --> 39:37.199
We've got the building
surrounded.

39:37.274 --> 39:39.708
Open the door slowly
and throw the gun out.

39:39.777 --> 39:42.177
WOMAN: Get out!
I'm taking care of this.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.504
Maria.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.311
Maria, it's Detective Stabler.
Are you all right?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.646
MARIA: Go away.

39:49.286 --> 39:50.446
Do it.

39:51.822 --> 39:52.811
(MAN YELLING)

39:53.791 --> 39:55.452
STABLER:
Maria, put down the gun.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.050
The bitch shot me!

39:57.128 --> 39:58.618
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

39:58.696 --> 40:01.221
Maria, Maria,
he's never gonna
hurt you again.

40:01.298 --> 40:02.663
Now give us the gun.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.564
Shoot her!
I didn't do anything!

40:04.635 --> 40:06.796
You killed my son,
you bastard!

40:06.871 --> 40:08.202
Don't Iisten to him.
Listen to us.

40:08.272 --> 40:09.830
Killing him won't
bring Miguel back.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.172
Maria, you have another son.
Think about Luis.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.212
MARIA: He will be safe.
STABLER: But he won't
have a mother.

40:15.279 --> 40:18.305
Now just put down the gun,
and this will all be over.

40:20.651 --> 40:23.176
Come on, Maria,
make Luis proud.

40:25.489 --> 40:27.013
Come on, Maria.

40:27.224 --> 40:28.782
How bad?
It's killing me.

40:28.859 --> 40:30.588
That's good.
It's just the knee.

40:30.661 --> 40:31.753
I'II call EMS.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.763
FIN: Where's Luis?
He's at my mother's house.

40:33.831 --> 40:37.062
He was going for the gun,
the one he keeps
in the bedroom.

40:37.134 --> 40:38.158
The bitch is a Iiar.

40:38.235 --> 40:39.224
Shut up.

40:39.303 --> 40:41.567
Maria, calm down. Calm down.
Look at me.

40:41.639 --> 40:44.267
Look at me.
Where did you get the gun?

40:44.408 --> 40:47.343
On the street.
I bought it.

40:53.884 --> 40:54.908
Come on.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.917
AIex, this is a big mistake.

40:59.990 --> 41:01.582
Maria bought a gun
with our money.

41:01.659 --> 41:03.286
To protect herself
and her son.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.351
To assassinate
her ex-boyfriend.

41:05.429 --> 41:06.418
(DOOR OPENING)

41:07.498 --> 41:09.090
What's going on?

41:09.266 --> 41:11.359
AIex wants to
indict Maria.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.032
For what?

41:14.104 --> 41:15.867
Attempted murder.

41:15.940 --> 41:19.876
Are you kidding me?
Fredo terrorized Maria
and her sons for two years.

41:19.944 --> 41:21.912
That doesn't give her
the right to become
a vigilante.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.243
This isn't about revenge,
AIex. It's self-defense.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.977
No, OIivia, Fredo's gun
was two rooms away.

41:27.051 --> 41:28.313
Unless Maria had
reason to believe

41:28.385 --> 41:29.682
her Iife was
in immediate danger,

41:29.753 --> 41:31.721
she had no justification
for shooting him.

41:31.789 --> 41:33.689
How about
extreme emotional distress?

41:33.757 --> 41:35.247
Doesn't apply here.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.557
Maria knew exactly
what she was doing.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.960
She dropped Luis off
at her mother's.

41:40.030 --> 41:41.292
She ditched
the Bronx detectives.

41:41.365 --> 41:43.060
She bought the gun,
and she went to kill Fredo.

41:43.133 --> 41:46.034
We put her in that position
because we couldn't
protect her.

41:46.103 --> 41:48.003
No one could guarantee
Maria's safety 100%.

41:48.072 --> 41:51.269
Look, she is scared
for her Iife and her boy's.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.003
Maria committed a crime.

41:53.077 --> 41:57.343
Which we are
partly responsible for.
AIex, cut her a break.

41:58.616 --> 42:00.049
I have to enforce the Iaw.

42:00.117 --> 42:04.076
Maria is your only eyewitness
to Fredo executing
Joey Stapleton.

42:04.154 --> 42:06.088
Convict her
and her credibility is shot,

42:06.156 --> 42:08.215
along with your murder case
against Fredo.

42:08.292 --> 42:12.092
The Iaw is not
always about justice.
Your words, remember?

42:12.796 --> 42:14.491
Maria didn't kill anybody.

42:14.565 --> 42:17.796
But, Fredo, Fredo's got
two bodies to his name
that we know about.

42:17.868 --> 42:21.065
We don't Iop
his head off now,
he will kill again,

42:21.138 --> 42:24.574
and if anything happens
to Maria or Luis,
it's on you.

42:37.588 --> 42:38.714
Get on the bus, Mijo,

42:38.789 --> 42:39.813
Okay.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.255
Take care of yourself,
Luis.

42:41.325 --> 42:42.383
LUIS: Bye.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.723
Would you tell my mother?

42:45.796 --> 42:48.230
That you've Ieft town, yes,
but not where you've gone.

42:48.299 --> 42:49.493
You'II have to call us.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.761
I will.

42:51.769 --> 42:52.758
Thank you.

42:52.836 --> 42:53.996
STABLER: Good Iuck.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.402
Thank you.

42:55.472 --> 42:56.461
(BUS ENGINE STARTING)

43:04.882 --> 43:07.510
He murdered her child.
She'II be back.

43:08.305 --> 43:14.616
