00:36.342 --> 00:41.680
Is there nothing so intoxicating
as the school hallway at early morn?

00:42.848 --> 00:45.968
The school normally
doesn't smell so rank.

00:47.394 --> 00:51.890
Washbasin fresh. That funk must be
coming from one of the classrooms.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.733
Poor fellow.
Crushed by his own water bottle.

01:03.827 --> 01:07.777
Willie, sometime over the holiday
weekend, the beloved grade-four gerbil...

01:07.998 --> 01:09.790
...Superdude, lost his life.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.535
I need you to air out the classroom
and give Superdude a proper burial.

01:17.383 --> 01:19.459
You're lucky you're getting
a decent burial.

01:19.635 --> 01:22.387
Me own father
got thrown in the bog.

01:24.807 --> 01:27.891
What in the name of
Saint Ephesiocritus...?

01:36.610 --> 01:37.939
What reeks?

01:38.153 --> 01:42.317
- Smells like one of van Houten's.
- It does not.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.616
Miss Hoover, the floor is shaking.

01:48.831 --> 01:51.535
Ralph, remember the time
you thought the...?

01:55.379 --> 01:59.756
Now, before we adjourn, I have one last
matter of utmost importance.

01:59.967 --> 02:03.418
I need to send this parcel with the profit
projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena.

02:03.637 --> 02:08.180
And it absolutely, positively,
has to be there overnight.

02:09.184 --> 02:11.391
- Pete Porter. Pass it on.
- Pasadena. Promptly.

02:11.562 --> 02:13.104
Package parcel processing.

02:13.314 --> 02:16.765
Perk up. Package of plant profit
projection for Pete Porter in Pasadena.

02:16.984 --> 02:18.727
- Priority?
- Precisely.

02:30.372 --> 02:32.412
Here's your package, Mr. Burns.

02:34.168 --> 02:37.418
My name is the return address,
you senseless dunderpate.

02:37.588 --> 02:39.212
Smithers, who is this nincompoop?

02:40.382 --> 02:43.834
I've worked here for 10 years and
my boss doesn't even know my name.

02:44.110 --> 02:45.968
Well, that's gonna change right now.

02:46.180 --> 02:48.256
My name is Homer J. Simp...

02:48.724 --> 02:51.476
...son.
- Sounded large when I ordered it.

02:51.685 --> 02:54.935
I can't make hide nor hair
of these metric booby traps.

02:55.939 --> 02:58.940
My Lord. Such destruction.

03:00.694 --> 03:02.983
Superintendent Chalmers.
How are you going?

03:03.197 --> 03:06.482
Why is it when I heard the word
"school" and the word "exploded"...

03:06.700 --> 03:08.693
...I thought of the word "Skinner"?!

03:09.620 --> 03:12.193
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Your custodian struck oil.

03:12.414 --> 03:16.282
You're standing on top of the richest
elementary school in the state.

03:16.794 --> 03:18.502
We also found this.

03:19.254 --> 03:21.330
Thank you. Superdude.

03:29.765 --> 03:32.552
A nonprofit organization with oil?
I won't allow it.

03:32.726 --> 03:34.849
An oil well doesn't belong
in the hands of...

03:35.200 --> 03:37.511
...Betsy Bleeding-heart
and Maynard G. Muskie-vote.

03:38.482 --> 03:42.895
Sir, have you had enough
exercise for this morning?

03:43.112 --> 03:44.440
No.

03:45.197 --> 03:47.273
Let's do another 20 miles.

03:56.375 --> 04:00.750
Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo.
Hello...

04:04.466 --> 04:07.800
Don't take it so hard, Homer. He's
always screwing up people's names.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.763
At the picnic, he thought my son
Reynaldo was Rolando.

04:10.931 --> 04:11.962
Can you believe it?

04:15.394 --> 04:17.517
Superintendent,
we made the front page today.

04:20.482 --> 04:23.982
- What's that say under your hand there?
- Oh, it's an unrelated article.

04:24.194 --> 04:26.270
It's an unrelated article.

04:26.488 --> 04:27.899
Within the banner headline.

04:28.115 --> 04:30.108
Yes. Now, to redirect our
conversation...

04:30.284 --> 04:32.276
...I have ideas on
spending this oil money.

04:32.494 --> 04:35.495
Well, we could give each student
a full college scholarship.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.542
Oh, mercy.

04:45.758 --> 04:47.418
Before we draw up the budget...

04:47.634 --> 04:50.126
...the students and faculty
have a few suggestions.

04:50.387 --> 04:55.726
I want a crystal bucket for my slop
water. And a brand-new filthy blanket.

04:57.645 --> 05:01.428
The cafeteria staff is complaining
about the mice in the kitchen.

05:01.607 --> 05:03.350
I wanna hire a new staff.

05:04.902 --> 05:07.607
I'd like to start a jazz program
in the music department.

05:07.821 --> 05:09.897
We've got a
great instructor lined up.

05:12.409 --> 05:13.785
- Tito Puente!
- Tito Puente!

05:15.829 --> 05:18.617
He's ready to give up
the professional mambo circuit...

05:18.791 --> 05:20.748
...and settle into
a nice teaching job.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.332
Man, it would be my pleasure.

05:23.545 --> 05:27.839
Lisa has told me all your students are as
bright and dedicated to jazz as she is.

05:29.301 --> 05:30.843
Let's go now, Mr. Puente.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.922
Chocolate microscopes.

05:34.139 --> 05:37.508
You know those guitars that are,
like, double guitars, you know?

05:37.726 --> 05:39.220
More rubber stamps.

05:40.270 --> 05:43.639
Principal Skinner, this is your secretary.
One last student to see you.

05:43.816 --> 05:46.141
That's odd.
I don't have a secretary.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.483
Or an intercom.
But send them in.

05:49.710 --> 05:53.318
Ahoy there, dean. I understand you're
taking suggestions from students, eh?

05:55.577 --> 05:59.492
Well, me and my fourth-form chums
think it would be quite corking...

05:59.665 --> 06:03.248
...if you'd sign over your oil well
to the local energy concern.

06:03.419 --> 06:04.747
Mr. Burns...

06:04.962 --> 06:07.453
It's naive of you to think
I'd mistake this town's...

06:07.631 --> 06:10.917
...most prominent 104-year-old man
for an elementary school student.

06:11.135 --> 06:14.171
I want that oil well.
I've got a monopoly to maintain.

06:14.346 --> 06:18.470
I own the electric company, waterworks,
plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue.

06:18.267 --> 06:20.592
That hotel's a dump and
your monopoly's pathetic.

06:20.769 --> 06:25.630
The oil well is not for sale, particularly to
a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself.

06:25.274 --> 06:26.602
I see.

06:26.775 --> 06:32.149
Then I'll just have to attack you.
I must have that oil.

06:34.158 --> 06:38.286
Smithers. Smithers,
help me subdue this beast.

06:38.495 --> 06:41.745
Sorry, sir. This was all I could find.
Take that. And that.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.497
Please don't waste those.

06:49.798 --> 06:51.127
I'm happy for the school.

06:51.342 --> 06:54.177
Sounds like this money is gonna
provide new opportunities.

06:54.386 --> 06:57.636
Big deal. They didn't approve my idea.
Said it was unfeasible.

06:57.848 --> 07:00.540
It is unfeasible
to resurrect the dead, Bart.

07:00.225 --> 07:03.808
And even if the Three Stooges were
alive, I doubt they'd hang out with you.

07:04.210 --> 07:07.105
I guess they'd wanna be with
their families or something, huh?

07:07.316 --> 07:08.893
Oh, I hate my job.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.104
What's the point when your boss
doesn't even remember your name?

07:12.321 --> 07:14.812
- I have an idea.
- What? What's your idea?

07:15.320 --> 07:17.523
When my father was trying
to catch my mother's eye...

07:17.701 --> 07:19.943
...he sent her a box of candy
with his photo.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.380
- After that, she never forgot him.
- That's all well and good.

07:23.207 --> 07:26.124
But it's not really your idea,
is it, now, Marge?

07:26.919 --> 07:30.833
That's it. Frimble about with
your widgets and doobobs.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.790
It will all be a monument to futility
when my plan comes to fruition.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.380
Sir.

07:36.929 --> 07:40.132
What I'm about to say violates
every sycophantic urge in my body...

07:40.307 --> 07:43.225
...but I wish you'd reconsider.
This isn't a rival company...

07:43.394 --> 07:46.395
...it's a school. They won't stand for it.
- Pishposh.

07:46.563 --> 07:49.101
It will be like taking
candy from a baby.

07:49.316 --> 07:51.356
Say, that sounds like a "larf."

07:51.568 --> 07:53.561
Let's try it right now.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.566
There's candy right here. Why
don't we eat this instead of stealing.

07:58.742 --> 08:00.402
Oh, very well.

08:05.582 --> 08:08.334
- Oh, look. There's a photo in here.
- Oh, yes.

08:08.502 --> 08:13.164
That's little Maggie Simpson, the baby
who found my teddy bear Bobo.

08:13.382 --> 08:16.751
And there's that Simpson mutt,
my former guard dog.

08:18.721 --> 08:22.137
And that's Bart Simpson. He was my
heir for a brief period, you know.

08:22.307 --> 08:24.347
Yes, sir. I remember.

08:28.220 --> 08:29.350
Anything left?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.230
Only the sour quince log, sir.

08:33.610 --> 08:34.938
Dispose of it.

08:35.361 --> 08:40.866
And send a thank-you note to
Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.

08:47.958 --> 08:50.628
Today, Springfield Elementary
embarks on a new era of...

08:50.794 --> 08:54.709
...unbridled spending where petrodollars
fuel our wildest educational fantasies.

08:54.882 --> 08:58.417
These young minds will enjoy every
academic advantage...

08:58.969 --> 09:02.136
...till they enter Springfield High School,
which has no oil well.

09:02.306 --> 09:05.805
- We got an air hockey table.
- Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump...

09:05.976 --> 09:10.270
...for the very first time, here's our
top student, Lisa Simpson.

09:10.481 --> 09:11.560
Nerd!

09:18.906 --> 09:20.448
There's no pressure.

09:20.658 --> 09:23.861
- Someone else has tapped this well.
- Ay caramba!

09:34.838 --> 09:38.753
Soon that mighty apparatus will
burst forth with its precious fluid.

09:38.967 --> 09:41.256
Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?

09:43.514 --> 09:45.138
Oil ho!

09:47.101 --> 09:48.892
Huzzah!

10:14.169 --> 10:16.791
Holy Christmas!

10:20.467 --> 10:23.587
Your dog's condition has been
upgraded from stable to frisky.

10:23.762 --> 10:26.847
He's free to go. His leg should
be good as new in a few months.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.507
In the meantime,
he'll have to use the wheel-about.

10:30.394 --> 10:34.261
I'll get even with whoever did this
to you, boy. I swear it.

10:34.523 --> 10:37.939
I almost forgot. Wouldn't want
you gnawing on those casts, eh, boy?

10:42.239 --> 10:45.904
We've got no legal recourse against
Mr. Burns' slant-drilling operation.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.199
The oil belongs to whoever
pumped it first.

10:48.412 --> 10:51.448
What about the expensive stuff
we wanted? Can we still have it?

10:51.665 --> 10:53.159
No.

10:54.251 --> 10:55.414
Blast it!

10:55.628 --> 10:59.210
To pay for the construction, operation
and demolition of the derrick...

10:59.381 --> 11:01.789
...we have to cut nonessential programs.
Music...

11:02.900 --> 11:04.480
- What?!
- And maintenance.

11:05.346 --> 11:08.970
I'll kill that Mr. Burns!

11:08.265 --> 11:13.307
And wound that Mr. Smithers.
Out of my way.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.580
Oh, no. That's awful, Mr. Puente.

11:16.732 --> 11:18.600
What?

11:18.233 --> 11:23.572
He owns the nuclear power plant.
Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash too.

11:23.781 --> 11:26.153
Dad, how can you work
for a man like Mr. Burns?

11:26.367 --> 11:29.118
He's not all bad. He did send me
this nice thank-you card.

11:29.328 --> 11:33.539
"Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie."
Dad, this doesn't have your name on it.

11:37.544 --> 11:40.462
Kids, would you
step outside for a second?

11:47.137 --> 11:50.910
Dear Lord. That's the loudest
profanity I've ever heard.

11:52.768 --> 11:56.813
These fumes aren't as fun as beer.
Sure, I'm all dizzy and nauseous...

11:56.980 --> 12:00.184
...but where's the inflated sense
of self-esteem?

12:03.988 --> 12:07.736
Hey, if you guys are getting loaded off
them fumes, I'll have to charge you.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.785
Man alive!
There are men alive in here.

12:10.995 --> 12:14.280
I'm detecting over
20 different toxins in the air.

12:16.375 --> 12:19.874
Everybody out. As long as
Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.670
Damn Burns.
Let me just get one thing.

12:25.342 --> 12:31.796
Me too. Now, there's the
inflated sense of self-esteem.

12:42.276 --> 12:44.482
Earthquake!

12:49.742 --> 12:51.818
- Nurse!
- Nurse! Nurse!

13:00.878 --> 13:03.360
Well, sir, you've
vanquished all your enemies.

13:03.213 --> 13:07.377
The elementary school, local tavern,
the old-age home. You must be proud.

13:07.593 --> 13:11.920
No, not while my greatest nemesis still
provides our customers...

13:11.263 --> 13:13.137
...with free light, heat and energy.

13:13.682 --> 13:17.182
I call this enemy... the sun.

13:26.236 --> 13:29.356
Since the beginning of time,
man has yearned to destroy the sun.

13:29.573 --> 13:31.732
I will do the next best thing:

13:32.117 --> 13:33.909
Block it out.

13:38.582 --> 13:40.990
- Good God!
- Imagine it, Smithers.

13:41.168 --> 13:44.204
Electrical lights and heaters
running all day long.

13:44.421 --> 13:46.793
But, sir, every plant
and tree will die.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.875
Owls will deafen us with incessant
hooting. The sundial will be useless.

13:52.221 --> 13:56.633
I don't want any part of this project.
It's unconscionably fiendish.

13:56.809 --> 13:58.351
I won't suffer your insubordination.

13:58.519 --> 14:02.351
There has been a shocking decline in the
quality and quantity of your toadying.

14:02.564 --> 14:04.391
And you will fall into line. Now!

14:05.192 --> 14:07.683
No. No, Monty, I won't.

14:07.903 --> 14:10.608
Not until you step back
from the brink of insanity.

14:10.823 --> 14:14.192
I'll do no such thing. You're fired.

14:20.791 --> 14:23.364
Take that, Bowl-a-rama.
Take that, convenience mart.

14:23.585 --> 14:25.827
Take that, nuclear power pla...

14:26.463 --> 14:27.792
Oh, fiddlesticks.

14:33.887 --> 14:37.932
I must say, Mr. Burns is being
awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even.

14:38.142 --> 14:41.178
Burns needs some serious
"boostafazoo." Right, Dad?

14:41.895 --> 14:44.386
Dad. Homer.

14:46.609 --> 14:49.942
Sorry, Grampa. It's just, for a second,
it looked like Dad had melted.

14:50.112 --> 14:52.520
Well, get used to it,
because I'm living here now.

14:52.698 --> 14:56.778
I ain't going back to the home until they
fish my bed out of that sinkhole.

14:56.952 --> 15:00.119
Strained carrots for Maggie.
Strained carrots for Grampa.

15:00.331 --> 15:01.908
I want a bib too.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.494
Smithers, who is that ignoramus?
Smithers, who is that lollygagger?

15:06.670 --> 15:08.959
Who is that blubber-pot?
Who is that bafflewit?

15:09.131 --> 15:11.124
Lummox. Puddinghead.
Mooncalf. Limpnoodle.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.628
Goldbricker. Drizzlepuss...

15:12.801 --> 15:15.506
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
- Look out!

15:15.721 --> 15:16.884
What?

15:19.266 --> 15:21.888
Just a minute.

15:33.906 --> 15:35.566
Who the devil are you?

15:38.770 --> 15:40.746
- Homer Simpson.
- What? What are you talking about?

15:40.913 --> 15:42.455
- Homer Simpson.
- Make sense, man.

15:42.623 --> 15:46.917
- I can't understand a word you're saying.
- My name is Homer Simpson.

15:47.860 --> 15:51.350
Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.
Oh, you're dead. You're dead, Burns!

15:52.700 --> 15:55.708
- Hey, the lamp's running away.
- That's my dog, man.

15:55.886 --> 16:00.382
So long, lamp. Now, stop loafing
and help your Grampa unpack.

16:03.185 --> 16:05.391
That's my old Smith & Wesson.

16:05.562 --> 16:08.267
If you're gonna play with it,
be careful. It's loaded.

16:08.732 --> 16:10.610
Bart, put that down!

16:10.317 --> 16:13.220
Guns are dangerous. And I won't
have them in this house.

16:14.113 --> 16:16.319
How can you have a house
without a gun?

16:16.490 --> 16:18.364
What if a bear came through the door?

16:19.785 --> 16:23.118
I'm going to bury it in the yard
where little hands can't get to it.

16:23.455 --> 16:26.770
You should've fired into the air.
She would've run off.

16:28.836 --> 16:30.912
People, take it easy.

16:31.130 --> 16:34.830
We're all upset about Mr. Burns'
plan to block out our sun.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.541
It is time for decisive action.

16:37.720 --> 16:41.302
I have here a polite but firm letter
to Mr. Burns' underlings...

16:41.515 --> 16:44.931
...who, with some cajoling,
will pass it along to him...

16:45.102 --> 16:47.141
...or at least
give him the gist of it.

16:47.313 --> 16:49.139
Sir, a lot of people
are stroking guns.

16:49.315 --> 16:52.648
It has been brought to my attention
a number of you are stroking guns.

16:52.818 --> 16:55.107
Therefore I'll step aside
and open up the floor.

16:55.320 --> 16:59.899
Mr. Burns was the closest thing
I ever had to a friend.

17:00.492 --> 17:01.821
But he fired me.

17:01.994 --> 17:05.861
And now I spend my days drinking cheap
Scotch and watching Comedy Central.

17:06.810 --> 17:09.616
- Oh, dear God.
- It's not that bad. I mean...

17:09.792 --> 17:11.453
...I never miss Pardon My Zinger.

17:11.627 --> 17:14.119
Burns cost me my
groundskeeping job at the school.

17:14.298 --> 17:17.464
And I'm too superstitious to take
the one at the cemetery.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.800
Because of him, I lost my room...

17:20.179 --> 17:24.590
...my things and my buddy's collection
of old sunbathing magazines.

17:24.808 --> 17:26.137
You bastard.

17:26.352 --> 17:29.210
- I lost my bar.
- I lost his bar.

17:29.229 --> 17:30.937
He robbed the school of music.

17:31.106 --> 17:34.309
- He robbed it of financial security.
- He robbed the school of Tito.

17:34.485 --> 17:37.402
- He can't remember my name!
- He's causing us all to yell!

17:38.530 --> 17:40.404
Look what he did to my best friend.

17:42.326 --> 17:43.868
No, my dog.

17:51.377 --> 17:53.915
Those wheels are squeaking a bit.

17:54.129 --> 17:56.169
Perhaps I could sell him a little oil.

17:58.175 --> 18:00.333
You twisted old monster!

18:04.140 --> 18:05.758
I've decided to protect myself...

18:05.974 --> 18:09.593
...ever since I was attacked in my office
by an unidentified assailant.

18:11.480 --> 18:16.580
Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye
a one-way passage to the boneyard.

18:16.276 --> 18:18.353
I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.

18:18.570 --> 18:24.691
I'll see that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal
machinations of hell's grim tyrant.

18:24.868 --> 18:27.490
- Yeah.
- Oh, you all talk big.

18:27.871 --> 18:31.205
But who here
has the guts to stop me?

18:36.755 --> 18:39.246
Very well. One last question.

18:39.466 --> 18:44.450
Have you ever seen
the sun set at 3 p. M?

18:44.930 --> 18:47.468
Once, when I was
sailing around the Arctic...

18:47.641 --> 18:52.220
Shut up, you. Take one last look
at the sun, Springfield.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.661
Hey, hey!

19:15.753 --> 19:18.837
I've been in Reno for six weeks.
Did I miss anything?

19:19.480 --> 19:20.790
What the...?

19:22.968 --> 19:26.384
Eternal darkness.
Well, that's just great.

19:26.555 --> 19:28.797
Listen, someone's
got to get that Mr. Burns.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.637
Where's a gun-toting lowlife
when you need one?

19:31.810 --> 19:33.720
Sorry, I was in the can.

19:37.566 --> 19:42.524
Perpetual twilight. Bathed in
the glow of Burns brand electricity.

19:43.697 --> 19:46.449
Hello, lamppost. What you knowing?

19:46.658 --> 19:50.158
I've come to watch
your power flowing.

19:52.873 --> 19:55.446
That's odd. Mr. Smithers
left his jacket behind.

19:58.462 --> 20:01.748
That's odd. Principal Skinner
left his mother behind.

20:08.263 --> 20:12.641
That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart?
And Lisa? And Grampa?

20:18.399 --> 20:22.313
After all these years, things are
finally starting to go my way.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.730
I feel like celebrating.

20:25.864 --> 20:28.190
Oh, it's you.
What are you so happy about?

20:28.867 --> 20:31.868
I see. I think you'd better drop it.

20:32.121 --> 20:34.612
I said, drop it!

20:36.667 --> 20:40.830
Get your hands off.

20:40.296 --> 20:42.418
Where is everybody?

20:46.760 --> 20:49.430
Hey, man. Are you okay?

20:50.889 --> 20:54.934
Won't... dignify that... with a response.

20:58.220 --> 20:59.895
Mr. Burns has been shot.

21:00.650 --> 21:03.434
Just a minute.
This isn't Mr. Burns at all.

21:03.652 --> 21:05.280
It's a mask.

21:08.782 --> 21:10.360
Oh, wait, it is Burns.

21:10.909 --> 21:12.701
His wrinkly skin looks like a mask.

21:12.911 --> 21:17.490
I don't think we'll ever know who
did this. Everyone in town's a suspect.

21:25.924 --> 21:28.415
Well, I couldn't possibly
solve this mystery.

21:28.802 --> 21:31.293
Can you?

21:33.265 --> 21:36.681
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.
I mean, you know, it's my job, right?
