Brandon?

33:35.381 --> 33:37.047
Yeah, I'm here.
Okay.

33:37.049 --> 33:40.117
It sounds like a lot of people
have let you down.

33:41.085 --> 33:42.319
But I can help you.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.587
I don't see how.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.055
I'll tell you how.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.556
You are famous now.

33:46.558 --> 33:50.327
And, you know, the world works
a little bit differently

33:50.329 --> 33:51.728
For famous people.

33:51.730 --> 33:56.500
You can't turn on the news
without seeing your face.

33:56.502 --> 33:59.202
And people want
to know everything --

33:59.204 --> 34:00.670
Everything about you.

34:04.342 --> 34:05.675
Hey, do you have
any news cameras

34:05.677 --> 34:07.144
Out there
with you right now?

34:07.146 --> 34:09.112

34:09.114 --> 34:10.514
Yeah, out there.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.050
Just a second, okay?
Don't go away. Hold on.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.689
You still there?

34:19.691 --> 34:23.393
Okay, hold on a second,
brandon.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.729
Hold on. Okay. Now...

34:25.731 --> 34:29.232
And you are live, brandon.
Go ahead.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.069
Okay.

34:32.071 --> 34:35.138
First, grandma,
if you're watching,

34:35.140 --> 34:38.608
Um, I appreciate all the help
you gave me to come out here.

34:44.415 --> 34:47.451
Mom and dad treated me
like I was invisible,

34:47.453 --> 34:50.454
But you always
believed in me,

34:50.456 --> 34:53.757
Even when other people
thought I was crazy.

34:58.563 --> 35:01.264

Hey, brandon.

Brandon? You there?

35:05.237 --> 35:06.670
Hello?

35:06.672 --> 35:10.173
I am really sorry,
but the network --

35:10.175 --> 35:12.275
You there?
Hello? Brandon?

35:12.277 --> 35:13.810
There you are.
Mm-hmm.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.378
Okay, listen, I'm so sorry,

35:15.380 --> 35:19.082
But the network says
that this interview

35:19.084 --> 35:20.584
Would be
so much more powerful

35:20.586 --> 35:22.419
If you would
just come outside

35:22.421 --> 35:25.055
And you would
finish it in person.

35:25.057 --> 35:26.590
Just you.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.191
Could you do that?

35:28.193 --> 35:31.628
No, that's okay.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.530
I'm pretty much done.

35:33.532 --> 35:36.500
Well, brandon, hold on.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.836
Can I just sleep here
for one night?

35:39.838 --> 35:41.204
Why do you want to
do that, brandon?

35:41.206 --> 35:42.606
I'm so tired.
Sharon: Why?

I got cut from the show.

36:00.225 --> 36:04.094
Brandon, carlo is right here

36:04.096 --> 36:06.296

love to meet you

36:06.298 --> 36:08.465

36:18.876 --> 36:20.744
Hi, carlo.

36:24.215 --> 36:25.749
Do you want to come out
and meet him in person?

36:25.751 --> 36:27.417
All you have to do,
brandon --

36:27.419 --> 36:29.352
All you have to do
is put your gun down

36:29.354 --> 36:32.422
And come slowly
out onto the porch

36:32.424 --> 36:33.690
With your arms raised.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.325
Oh, I don't have a gun.

36:35.327 --> 36:38.161
I don't even like guns.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.729
Oh, well,
that's -- that's good.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.867

Hello? Brandon?

36:47.806 --> 36:52.342
Tell carlo I'm sorry
I broke his chair, okay?

36:52.344 --> 36:55.145
I have
a funny temper sometimes.

[ chuckles ]

36:57.216 --> 37:00.183
I'm just passionate
about what I want, I guess.

Yes.

[ laughs ]

37:04.456 --> 37:06.256
But you know what?

37:06.258 --> 37:10.594
You have to be passionate to be
famous in hollywood, right?

37:10.596 --> 37:12.495
Yes. That is right.

37:12.497 --> 37:16.299

want to meet carlo, brandon,

All you got to do...

37:17.903 --> 37:20.737
Is come on out.

37:26.644 --> 37:32.549
Tell carlo I expect
we'll end up in the same place.

37:32.551 --> 37:33.650

I made him think
he was on television.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.361
I gave him
something he wanted

38:51.363 --> 38:53.763
Without getting something
in return.

none of us got hurt,
