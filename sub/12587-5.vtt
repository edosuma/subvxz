<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:31.990 --> 00:34.368
<i>Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Hill.</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:36.746
Just give me one second
to find Bobby's test.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.372
Excellent, great work.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.541
Satisfactory, needs improvement.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.043
Unsatisfactory.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.259
Yes, here's Bobby.

00:45.671 --> 00:46.968
"D-"?

00:46.964 --> 00:48.011
Dang it, Bobby.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.428
I expect more from someone

00:49.424 --> 00:52.018
with no extracurricular
activities.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.978
I'm sorry, Dad. I tried.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.848
Math's just not my thing.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.771
I told you we should have
let him watch Sesame Street.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.984
Don't blame me.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.400
The boy was terrified
of puppets.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.114
Too bad that didn't stick.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.780
So, I guess it's not my fault?

01:06.775 --> 01:07.947
Or mine.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.911
Maybe Bobby's
just a bad test taker.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.997
Some kids have trouble
handling the stress

01:11.989 --> 01:13.332
of testing situations.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.870
This is ridiculous.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.209
My boy's flunking out,

01:16.201 --> 01:18.124
and you're just making excuses.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.963
Carl, aren't you
gonna say something?

01:19.955 --> 01:22.299
Hmm? Oh, oh, sorry, Hank.
I wasn't listening.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.043
Uh, I'm mainly here for backup.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.090
You would not believe
how quickly

01:26.086 --> 01:28.839
these parent/teacher conferences
can turn violent.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.432
Hank, I do not know
how you can eat

01:37.431 --> 01:39.729
when our boy
is so close to the edge.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.022
He'll be fine.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.441
He just needs to work harder
and apply himself.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.110
Yeah, about that.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.858
I was thinking that maybe
we shouldn't dismiss

01:47.858 --> 01:51.112
this "bad test taker" thing
so quickly.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.034
Bobby, no more excuses.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.658
The only thing that's wrong
with you is that you're lazy.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.751
And that's gonna change
right now.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.212
And I will be your
instrument of change.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.082
I will tutor you
and flash-card you

02:03.081 --> 02:05.834
until you claw your way
up to a "C-."

02:05.834 --> 02:07.302
I hate letter grades.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.841
Why can't we just go back

02:08.836 --> 02:11.056
to the gold star/smiley face
system?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.012
The same reason
we won't let you sleep

02:13.175 --> 02:15.098
with your "banky" anymore.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.095
But I still...
Yip.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.392
Oh.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.103
I'll forward it to you...

02:24.102 --> 02:26.275
but better wait till you get
home before you open it.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.114
Carl, the school board's
got a problem.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.909
A "No Child Left Behind"
problem.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.624
Stu, tell the school board
we haven't left behind a child

02:37.616 --> 02:39.289
in over five years
at Tom Landry.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.831
Hell, we pass everybody.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.625
Carl, the government
doesn't care

02:42.621 --> 02:44.419
if your kids pass their classes.

02:44.414 --> 02:48.590
They just care if your kids pass
the yearly standardized test,

02:48.585 --> 02:51.464
which they haven't done
in two years.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.090
Oh, is that
what that law's about?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.263
Have you even read the manual?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.885
Well, to tell you the truth,

02:56.885 --> 02:58.603
I got a few pages into it,

02:58.595 --> 03:00.097
<i>but it's no Harry Potter.</i>

03:00.097 --> 03:02.020
And-and then the new <i>Harry
Potter</i> came out, and well, I...

03:02.182 --> 03:04.810
Damn it, Carl.
That test is in a few weeks.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.608
You haven't done squat
to prepare for it.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.106
Now, if your kids
fail this again,

03:09.106 --> 03:11.905
the state can come in
and fire all of you.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.117
And Carl, I imagine
the first head

03:16.113 --> 03:19.037
on the chopping block's
going to be the principal's.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.963
Okay, kids, I need everyone
to listen up real good.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.008
We got a very important
standardized test coming up.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.255
If y'all don't pass it,

03:33.255 --> 03:35.098
me and your teachers
could be out of a job.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.091
Yes!

03:36.091 --> 03:38.093
Good.
We hate you guys!

03:39.302 --> 03:40.679
Let's see how you feel

03:40.679 --> 03:42.101
after Tom Landry gets shut down

03:42.097 --> 03:43.895
and y'all are shipped
to other schools.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.517
Maybe a few of you
will get lucky

03:45.517 --> 03:46.894
and end up in North Arlen,

03:46.893 --> 03:49.271
but most of you'll
be finishing out your year...

03:49.271 --> 03:50.898
in Durndle.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.575
Okay, students, circle up!

03:57.571 --> 03:59.665
Today, the only muscle
you'll be stretching

03:59.656 --> 04:00.999
is your noggin.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.584
What happened to kickball?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.954
Gone. Over. Eliminated.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.082
Effective immediately,
all classes, including gym,

04:08.081 --> 04:10.049
will be teaching math
and reading

04:10.208 --> 04:12.552
to help prepare you
for the test.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.342
Okay. Dooley!

04:15.338 --> 04:17.807
I've got a five-pound
medicine ball in this hand

04:17.798 --> 04:20.723
and a ten-pound medicine ball
in this hand.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.517
If you were to multiply
the weightage

04:22.512 --> 04:25.391
of both balls together,
what would you get?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.313
I pass.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.526
Oh, for...

04:28.518 --> 04:29.485
Hill?

04:30.562 --> 04:33.065
Can you use it
in a sentence, please?

04:33.231 --> 04:34.073
What?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.485
I just did,
you little Knucklehead!

04:46.036 --> 04:47.788
We're never gonna
pass this test.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.337
These dumb-dumbs
can't even do simple math.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.084
Kleehammer, you're
not the only one

04:52.083 --> 04:53.335
under some stress here.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.258
We're all freaking out.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.596
How about this?

04:56.588 --> 04:57.589
Uh, during the test,

04:57.589 --> 04:59.307
we could just move
three smart kids

04:59.299 --> 05:00.425
around each dumb kid.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.098
You know they're gonna cheat.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.094
What if we happen

05:03.094 --> 05:05.062
to find some marijuana

05:05.055 --> 05:07.149
in some of the
dumb kids' lockers?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.107
Wait.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.446
Think I might have
found a technicality.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.165
Bobby Hill,

05:28.161 --> 05:30.038
Principal Moss needs you.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.963
Now!

05:44.511 --> 05:45.603
Okay, kids,

05:45.595 --> 05:46.596
listen up.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.098
In a few minutes, Mr. Terkelson

05:48.098 --> 05:50.351
from the district's gonna
be here to evaluate

05:50.350 --> 05:52.569
whether you're
a special needs child or not.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.108
Special needs?

05:54.104 --> 05:56.983
But I'm not special needs,
Principal Moss.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.108
Well, Bobby, I think you should

05:58.108 --> 06:00.076
let the expert decide.
Wait.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.411
Maybe he's right, Carl.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.497
Maybe he will pass
the evaluation.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.582
Then, you can go back
to your regular class

06:05.574 --> 06:07.201
and continue studying
day and night

06:07.200 --> 06:10.079
for the standardized test,
which you'll probably fail.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.089
Let me bottom-line this
for you, kids.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.800
If you don't do so well
on this evaluation,

06:15.792 --> 06:18.921
that means you're gonna be
labeled a special needs child,

06:18.920 --> 06:21.343
which means you're
no longer required

06:21.339 --> 06:23.057
to take the standardized test.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.349
Oh, and did I mention...

06:26.344 --> 06:28.096
you'd no longer
have any homework.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.973
That sounds pretty good,

06:29.973 --> 06:32.101
but I still don't think
I'm special...

06:32.100 --> 06:34.102
And you get to go
on the field trip

06:34.102 --> 06:35.820
to Alamo Land next week.

06:37.355 --> 06:41.110
But I thought that trip was only
for the kids on the honor roll.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.487
Well, it would be an honor

06:43.486 --> 06:46.080
for the special needs kids
to come along.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.164
You know what.
I think you're right.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.959
I should let the expert decide.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.379
Okay, children.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.254
Does this clown look sad...

07:00.253 --> 07:02.051
or happy?

07:09.387 --> 07:13.062
Now, raise your hand
if you think he's happy.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.906
Thank God I'm here.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.321
There's so much work to do.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.115
Okay, Bobby,

07:29.115 --> 07:31.117
it's time to go
over your algebra.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.087
Your mom left some flash
cards to help you study.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.081
I don't have to study anymore.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.082
Why is that?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.959
It's all explained here.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.012
Special needs?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.381
What the hell?

07:44.381 --> 07:47.555
Now, excuse me,
I have a special need

07:47.550 --> 07:50.053
for something dipped
in chocolate.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.488
No homework, no tests.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.107
Why would they put
him in that class?

08:02.107 --> 08:04.109
He doesn't have any
learning problems.

08:04.109 --> 08:07.409
Maybe this explains
why he hates taking tests

08:07.404 --> 08:09.532
and why his grades are so bad.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.625
I swear to you now, Hank,

08:11.616 --> 08:15.541
I will love that boy
no matter how special he is.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.595
Oh, my sweet, sweet boy,
look at you.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.305
You come here.
Come give your mama a hug.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.844
Okay.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.472
Oh, you...

08:39.059 --> 08:40.562
Carl!

08:48.111 --> 08:49.784
Dang it.

08:56.119 --> 09:00.044
Do you know where the, uh,
special needs class is?

09:13.470 --> 09:14.471
Excellent.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.690
Fine motor skills, Dooley.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.025
You're the class
super-duper champ

09:19.184 --> 09:21.278
of the morning.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.021
Excuse me.
I'm Hank Hill,

09:23.188 --> 09:24.610
Bobby's father.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.108
You must be
Mr. Terkelson.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.654
Yes. Can I help you?

09:27.650 --> 09:28.993
Hey, Dad.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.364
Uh, yeah, I'd like a word
with you outside.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.786
Class, you can rest your eyes,

09:34.783 --> 09:36.160
but no sleepies.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.911
I'll be right back.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.044
Mr. Terkelson, my boy

09:42.040 --> 09:43.383
doesn't belong in your class.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.671
He was just put here

09:44.667 --> 09:46.965
so he wouldn't take
the standardized test.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.258
Test? He...

09:48.254 --> 09:50.723
he shouldn't be taking
any standardized test, Mr. Hill.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.809
Not until I can fully evaluate
his condition.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.269
There is no condition.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.015
That boy is about as normal
as you or, well, as me.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.105
Sadly, 20 years ago,
you would have been right.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.069
Bobby would have
been labeled normal.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.063
Those truly were the dark ages

10:05.230 --> 10:06.652
of public education.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.116
Let me ask you something.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.987
Have you ever found a kid
who wasn't special?

10:12.278 --> 10:13.279
No.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.498
Mr. Terkelson, I want my boy

10:15.490 --> 10:18.164
taken out of this
ridiculous class immediately

10:18.159 --> 10:20.082
or I'm going to the district.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.957
Sorry, Mr. Hill,
I am the district,

10:22.956 --> 10:24.458
and your son is staying

10:24.457 --> 10:27.085
until he gets the care he needs.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.884
Okay, we're gonna have
to skip P.E. today

10:29.879 --> 10:31.096
because I don't have enough

10:31.089 --> 10:34.059
first-place ribbons
to go around.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.095
That class
is ridiculous.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.723
If the school's spending
all their time and money

10:39.722 --> 10:41.724
on these kids, who's taking care

10:41.724 --> 10:43.271
of the kids
who really need help?

10:43.268 --> 10:45.987
I was evaluated when
I joined the military.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.323
The tests said
I was "dull normal."

10:48.314 --> 10:49.941
I, for one, am relieved

10:49.941 --> 10:52.114
that Joseph has been labeled
special needs

10:52.110 --> 10:54.363
'cause that means
it's not my fault.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.868
Ah.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.867
Yep, not my fault.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.754
We got most of the "D"s
and "C"s accounted for.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.588
Once we take care
of any possible wild cards,

11:04.581 --> 11:05.673
we'll be home free.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.088
Look,

11:08.084 --> 11:10.086
that kid is just
staring into space

11:10.086 --> 11:12.054
as if our jobs
weren't on the line.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.468
I'm on it.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.260
Come with me, Jack,

11:17.260 --> 11:19.103
and leave your books.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.189
You're not gonna be needing them
where you're going.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.447
Hi, I'm Bobby.

11:33.443 --> 11:37.118
Preliminary attention disorder
and possibly dyslexic.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.332
We're still waiting
on the test results.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.828
And this is Joseph...
Articulation disorder.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.329
I got it bad, dude.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.751
I don't want to be here.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.090
I was just daydreaming.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.925
Yeah, we all felt
like you did at first,

11:49.918 --> 11:52.546
but then we saw
the ice cream cart.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.468
Do they have fudgesicles?

11:54.464 --> 11:56.011
Three different kinds.

11:56.007 --> 12:00.103
And any time you need a break,
you can ask for beanbag time,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.641
which is unlimited.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.978
Oh, and did I mention

12:04.974 --> 12:07.978
that we get to go to
Alamo Land next week?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.274
Really?
Yeah,

12:09.270 --> 12:13.025
so when you get evaluated,
don't try to be a hero.

12:13.024 --> 12:16.073
Shoot for one right answer
out of every four

12:16.069 --> 12:17.412
and you'll be just fine.

12:21.115 --> 12:24.289
Look what I made
in school for you, Mom.

12:24.285 --> 12:28.586
Oh, Bobby,
you are my little miracle.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.380
Peggy, he was making those
when he was four.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.799
Ugh, that preschool
was so demanding.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.924
Well, I've got to go practice
my zipper song.

12:36.923 --> 12:40.598
I think I can learn it
before the Alamo Land trip.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.065
Wait a second, Bobby.

12:46.057 --> 12:49.061
I thought only the good students
were allowed to go on that trip.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.438
Hank, the school did not want
to discriminate

12:51.437 --> 12:54.816
against the special-needs kids,
so they're letting them go,

12:54.816 --> 12:58.070
and I think
it was the right decision.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.497
Now, where was I?

13:01.489 --> 13:02.536
Oh, yeah.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.087
Okay, Melissa.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.432
The logarithm to the base three
of nine is?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.802
Uh, three?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.098
Three.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.687
No, not even close!

13:24.679 --> 13:25.896
Back of line!

13:27.473 --> 13:28.599
Who's next?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.476
Two?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.104
Of course it's two.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.572
Very good, Jamie.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.111
Here's your Fast Pass.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.450
Enjoy your ride.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.991
You can tell Melissa
all about it.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.580
Next!

13:42.572 --> 13:44.870
Feel free to wet yourself.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.790
The splash at the bottom
will cover your shame.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.253
Your dad's so cool.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.464
I don't know
why my parents hate him.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.335
Whoa,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.884
there's a six-person maximum
on this ride.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.005
Park rule.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.054
But, but my girlfriend's
on that ride.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.062
Oh, man, that's totally
a make-out ride.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.806
You can't leave her alone
with Dooley.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.729
Do something, Bobby.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.102
Excuse me, sir.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.648
We are special-
needs children

14:13.644 --> 14:16.818
and we are required by state law

14:16.814 --> 14:19.488
to stay with our buddies
at all times.

14:19.484 --> 14:23.079
Uh, okay, go ahead.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.829
It has begun!

14:31.829 --> 14:33.046
Look at me.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.509
I'm flume-surfing.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.845
That is so cool.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.760
Dude, I can do it, too.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.113
We are approaching
the bottomless pit drop.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.608
Brace yourselves.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.716
Wingo!

15:23.714 --> 15:26.308
Gribble, where your dumb kids?

15:29.095 --> 15:31.974
Oh, my God,
the special-needs kids!

15:31.973 --> 15:33.520
They're in the water!

15:46.195 --> 15:48.118
What are the special-needs kids
doing here

15:48.114 --> 15:49.582
without any supervision?

15:49.574 --> 15:50.951
Who let this happen?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.203
Whoever it was, they're
going to pay for this.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.091
Mom, I'm fine, really.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.513
I cannot believe
they let this happen to you.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.352
Somebody will pay for this.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.097
Bobby shouldn't have been
on that trip to begin with,

16:13.097 --> 16:15.099
and if anything,
this is his fault.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.024
He's the one who made that guy
jam ten kids on the log flume.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.814
Oh, lay off him, Hank.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.283
He might not know what ten is.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.948
Miguel Hernandez,

16:25.943 --> 16:27.490
live from Alamo Land
Amusement Park

16:27.487 --> 16:30.491
where earlier today a group
of special-needs children

16:30.490 --> 16:32.333
narrowly and miraculously

16:32.325 --> 16:34.123
avoided disaster after falling

16:34.118 --> 16:37.292
out of the Falls of Fury
log flume ride.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.289
Your thoughts.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.506
I just don't know

16:39.499 --> 16:42.093
why these special ed kids
were even on this trip.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.631
I didn't see a chaperone

16:43.628 --> 16:46.256
and none of them were wearing
protective head gear.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.724
And I know the principal
knew all about it, too.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.514
Excuse me, we have just received

16:50.510 --> 16:53.434
an exclusive photo
of the near-disaster.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.806
Let's go right to it.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.606
You're in deep.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.108
The district's out for blood.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.737
I wish I could help you,
but they want your job.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.615
But Stu, I've been a principal
half my life.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.992
I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.834
What were you thinking, Carl?

17:15.826 --> 17:16.952
You know you're not supposed

17:16.953 --> 17:19.080
to take the special-needs kids
off campus,

17:19.079 --> 17:20.423
let alone to an amusement park,

17:20.414 --> 17:22.007
without getting
district approval.

17:22.165 --> 17:26.090
Listen, Stu, those kids are no
more special than you and me.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.259
They were never in any danger.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.802
I-I just put 'em
in that class

17:28.798 --> 17:30.800
so we could pass
the standardized test.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.767
I-I didn't hear that.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.976
You, you can't prove
I heard that.

17:35.096 --> 17:37.724
This is still America, right?

17:37.723 --> 17:40.146
The land of second chances?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.028
Hank,

17:43.187 --> 17:44.439
thank God you're here.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.781
You got to help me.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.070
Help you?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.535
Kicking your ass seems
more appropriate, Carl.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.120
I'm just going
to come clean here.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.114
I just labeled those kids
special needs

17:53.114 --> 17:54.661
so they wouldn't take the test.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.034
Of course you did.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.330
I'm really stuck here.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.249
I don't have anyone
to take the blame.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.997
Emily's too young
to take the fall

18:00.997 --> 18:04.092
and everybody thinks Dale
Gribble's a special-needs kid.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.929
You have to let those kids
take the standardized test.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.014
If they pass,
it'll prove they're not special;

18:10.172 --> 18:13.096
they're just a bunch of kids
acting like jackasses,

18:13.092 --> 18:16.687
and that you didn't do anything
wrong... a-at that moment.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.683
But those kids will never pass
that test.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.356
All they need is to be
pushed a little, Carl.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.024
That's all they ever needed.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.115
I guess we can try
educating 'em.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.704
All right, kids, it's test time.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.048
You worked real hard this week,
and I'm proud of you.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.963
I have

19:27.958 --> 19:30.052
every confidence
that you'll knock that test

19:30.044 --> 19:31.387
out of the park today.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.882
Now, go get 'em!

19:44.016 --> 19:46.018
Well, I give you credit, son.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.066
You worked hard and it paid off.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.073
Well, I knew all along
he was going to pass.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.361
I guess our boy is
special after all.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.112
I'll see you later

19:56.112 --> 19:58.410
and please stop using that word.

19:58.406 --> 20:01.376
Well, it's a shame
the school failed again.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.462
I heard the scores actually
went down from last year.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.296
Well, I guess
you cannot blame the district

20:06.288 --> 20:07.710
for shaking things up.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.584
We're lucky they didn't shut
the whole school down.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.052
Yeah, but I don't know how great
of an interim principal

20:15.214 --> 20:17.182
Coach Kleehammer is going to be.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.479
Study up today, maggots.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.269
I wonder what's going
to happen to Principal Moss.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.858
Well, he'll pull through.

20:25.850 --> 20:26.851
You know Carl.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.569
He's a survivor.

20:31.272 --> 20:34.116
Good Lord, Carl,
I almost hit you.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.109
Sorry about that, Hank.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.907
It's just that we got
a new product

20:36.902 --> 20:39.121
everyone at the company's
real excited about

20:39.113 --> 20:41.582
and I didn't want you and yours
to miss out on it.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.121
You're selling steaks?

20:43.117 --> 20:45.336
Not really. These things
sell themselves.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.624
Take a look at this beauty.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.043
Hmm.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.087
I never heard
of a J-bone.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.926
Help a brother out, guys.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.044
I need to keep
my medical current

20:54.211 --> 20:55.713
until my suspension's over.

20:55.713 --> 20:56.839
I got that disease

20:56.839 --> 20:59.058
where you wake up in
strange places drunk.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.562
Uh, put us down for five,
I guess.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:54.480 --> 21:57.074
<i>Gribble, where your dumb kids?</i>
