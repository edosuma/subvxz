WEBVTT

03:52.900 --> 03:54.151
Okay.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.527
So we're here.

03:55.653 --> 03:56.946
What now?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.782
Pay attention.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.158
You'll find out.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.246
I'm looking for a place.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.750
Do you understand the place?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.169
Place?

04:16.674 --> 04:19.760
Three people have given me
coordinates to that place.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.097
Two of the coordinates match.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.559
What would you do, Richard?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.188
I'd check out the two
that match.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.775
You're a very bright young man.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.445
And we're very close
to the two that match.

04:40.656 --> 04:41.991
It says it's right up there.

04:44.702 --> 04:45.786
We're going up there?

04:46.704 --> 04:47.538
Yeah.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.207
We're going up there
right now.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.441
People?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.780
Dear God.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.878
Is this it?

06:19.630 --> 06:21.757
I'll bet it's right up there
on that rock.

06:30.224 --> 06:33.018
I'm 25 years your senior.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.937
Take this
and get on up there.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.941
It'll beep when you're close

06:39.066 --> 06:41.568
and make a continuous tone
when you're on it.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.197
Let me know what you find.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.162
I'm there!

08:44.608 --> 08:45.609
Oh.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.616
Good-bye, my son.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.921
Bad, bad binoculars.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.923
Bad binoculars!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.634
Bad, bad, bad binoculars!

10:45.187 --> 10:46.813
You hear that bird
this morning?

10:48.899 --> 10:50.067
Sure as shit did.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.006
Who's this here?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.682
What the hell are they
doing here?

11:49.418 --> 11:51.253
Well, it looks like
nobody's home.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.421
Oh?

11:52.546 --> 11:54.631
And how did you deduce that,
Sherlock?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.636
Wilson, you son of a bitch,
go grab a car and park somewhere

11:59.761 --> 12:01.471
over there out of sight
and stake out this house.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.597
Okay.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.182
Come here.

12:04.307 --> 12:07.185
I'm gonna check out
the place of business‒

12:07.310 --> 12:09.229
Lucky 7 Insurance, hmm?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.022
Wilson!

12:11.857 --> 12:12.858
Get going!

12:25.078 --> 12:27.289
Good riddance.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.581
I just heard
what you've been telling me.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.583
He's in a coma,

13:11.708 --> 13:14.753
but his vital signs
are good, strong.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.172
Yeah, but when people
go into a coma,

13:17.297 --> 13:19.049
they can stay there for years.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.176
Oh, Dougie's
not gonna do that.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.179
Mom, does a coma have something
to do with electricity?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.180
No, honey.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.807
Well, in this case, it did.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.363
Well, just‒
I told you I'd carry it.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.698
I just don't know‒
Here he is. Here he is.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.173
Bushnell, we came
as soon as we heard.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.594
These are the Mitchum brothers,
Janey-E.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.721
- They're friends of Dougie's.
- Oh, oh.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.432
Um, Sonny Jim,
these are the men who, uh‒

14:09.558 --> 14:11.560
who bought your gym set
and‒and the car.

14:11.685 --> 14:12.936
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.312
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.939
Every kid should have
a gym set, huh?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.109
Let me see that.
Look at that.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.737
We've‒
We've seen this before.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.407
Uh, this sort
of thing happens,

14:25.532 --> 14:26.575
and you don't feel
like cooking.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.743
You don't want to eat
hospital food.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.744
- But...
- Oh.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.496
...Jimmy, you've got to eat.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.250
These are what you call
finger sandwiches.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.209
Go ahead.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.504
You pick it up
with your fingers.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.964
Very good. That's why they
call it a finger sandwich.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.757
Girls, go‒go‒
go bring in the, uh‒

14:42.883 --> 14:43.925
the folding trays.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.468
Hey, hey, maybe
we should eat outside.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.345
No, no, no, no, no,
we're not gonna stay.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.763
This is all for you.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.932
We just want to be
as helpful as possible

14:51.057 --> 14:53.727
and, uh‒and, uh‒
and, uh, pay our respects.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.608
All things considered,

14:59.733 --> 15:01.109
he looks good.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.613
Yeah, well, the doctors
are very hopeful.

15:04.738 --> 15:09.117
If I can trouble you
for a key, Mrs. Jones,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.244
we're gonna go
stock your house too.

15:11.953 --> 15:12.787
Oh.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.707
Wow.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.626
Okay, um...

15:19.419 --> 15:21.129
Here you go.
Thank you.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.133
It was...

15:26.343 --> 15:27.344
...like, what?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.096
Electricity?

16:26.236 --> 16:27.153
Mom.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.114
I have to go pee.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.324
Okay.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.994
Let's go find you
the little boys' room.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.563
This is Bushnell.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.273
- <i>Uh, Phil Bisby here.</i>
- Hello, Phil.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.233
<i>The FBI was just here
looking for Dougie.</i>

17:05.358 --> 17:07.068
- What?
<i>- The FBI.</i>

17:07.193 --> 17:08.570
The FBI?

17:08.695 --> 17:09.904
<i>Yeah, they were looking
for Dougie.</i>

17:10.030 --> 17:10.947
Looking for Dougie?

17:11.072 --> 17:12.157
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:12.907 --> 17:14.743
Wha‒what's he done now?
He's in a coma.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.453
<i>Uh, I-I-I, uh...</i>

17:16.578 --> 17:17.412
Did you tell them we're here?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.330
<i>Yeah, I did,
and then they left.</i>

17:19.456 --> 17:20.832
- You did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

17:21.791 --> 17:23.084
When did they leave?

17:23.209 --> 17:24.627
<i>About ten minutes ago, sir.</i>

17:27.047 --> 17:27.881
Okay.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.040
Looks like it's gonna be
a long day.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.798
Remember that guy Sammy?

18:51.923 --> 18:52.757
Yeah.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.134
He passed away.

18:54.926 --> 18:55.760
Oh.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.638
He was a good guy.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.182
I owed him money.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.896
You feel bad about that?

19:07.021 --> 19:07.981
Eh.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.214
What is this now?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.516
Is one of them guys Dougie?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.227
Douglas?

19:46.352 --> 19:48.897
Do any of them look
anything like our boss?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.690
No, stupid,
none of them is Dougie.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.734
Will you settle down now?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.277
It's the last bag, Hutch.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.571
It's the last fucking bag.

19:59.032 --> 19:59.949
You on the rag?

20:00.074 --> 20:01.451
What if I fucking was?

20:01.576 --> 20:02.535
Whoa.

20:04.746 --> 20:05.830
Okay.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.965
Looks like a fucking
circus parade.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.099
Stretch limo...

20:26.226 --> 20:27.602
...girls in pink.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.731
No Douglas Jones.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.091
What the fuck?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.270
Hello.

21:12.146 --> 21:12.981
Hello.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.149
You're in my driveway.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.654
We're not in your driveway.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.407
We're not even close to your
fucking driveway, asshole.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.159
Go fuck yourself!

21:32.166 --> 21:33.293
I move car.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.820
That fucker!

22:11.873 --> 22:13.374
What the fuck, Chantal?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.710
That douchebag is really
pissing me off!

22:15.835 --> 22:17.545
Ah, Chantal!

22:17.670 --> 22:18.880
Fucking winged me!

22:19.005 --> 22:20.590
This shit is fucking up
the whole thing.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.721
Get us the fuck out of here.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.236
What the fuck
kind of neighborhood is this?

23:25.571 --> 23:27.740
People are under
a lot of stress, Bradley.

23:30.993 --> 23:31.828
Yeah.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.088
FBI!

23:42.922 --> 23:44.632
Put the gun down!

23:47.760 --> 23:50.346
I said put the gun down!

23:53.266 --> 23:55.643
Now slowly back away
from your gun.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.270
Put down the gun, okay?

23:58.354 --> 24:00.481
Let's get the girls
and get out of here, all right?

24:08.948 --> 24:10.908
I need backup and an ambulance

24:11.033 --> 24:11.993
at Lancelot Court.

24:12.702 --> 24:13.995
Lancelot Court!

25:27.777 --> 25:30.029
One hundred percent.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.989
Do you have the seed?

26:13.114 --> 26:14.699
Do you have the seed?

26:30.172 --> 26:32.049
I need you to make another one.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.329
Dougie?

27:01.454 --> 27:02.955
Dad?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.167
Dougie.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.585
Hello, Sonny Jim.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.837
Oh, my...

27:09.962 --> 27:11.297
Dougie.

27:12.548 --> 27:13.716
Hello, Janey-E.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.011
Dougie's back!

27:17.136 --> 27:19.221
I knew it.

27:19.347 --> 27:21.849
Janey-E, would you please
go find a doctor right now?

27:21.974 --> 27:22.850
- Yeah.
- Sonny Jim...

27:22.975 --> 27:24.268
why don't you go
with your mom?

27:24.393 --> 27:25.478
Okay.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.564
Bushnell, pass me
some of those sandwiches.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.774
I'm starving.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.401
The office just called.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.487
The FBI was there
looking for you.

27:36.155 --> 27:36.989
Perfect.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.034
You sure came through this
pretty strong.

27:42.411 --> 27:44.497
Whoa, whoa, what do you think
you're doing?

27:44.622 --> 27:45.706
I no longer need this IV.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.250
Doctor, will you confirm
that my vitals are A-okay?

27:48.376 --> 27:49.669
I'm leaving.

27:50.753 --> 27:52.046
Bushnell, my clothes, please.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.714
The cabinet behind you.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.133
Dougie, are you sure
this is a good idea?

27:56.258 --> 27:57.927
It's a good idea.

27:58.052 --> 28:01.055
It looks like it's a pretty good idea.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.891
I'll prep your release papers.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.893
Janey-E, please bring the car
around front.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.978
I'll get dressed
and meet you downstairs.

28:09.605 --> 28:10.981
Okay.
Come on, Sonny Jim.

28:11.107 --> 28:14.026
Daddy thinks we should
get the car around.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.029
Thank you, Bushnell.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.083
Dad sure is talking a lot.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.961
Yeah, he sure is, Sonny Jim.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.591
Bushnell, I'm gonna need
to borrow the.32 snub nose

28:37.717 --> 28:40.803
you wear in the shoulder holster
under your left arm.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.471
Sure thing, Dougie.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.437
Is everything all right?

28:49.562 --> 28:51.105
Can I help you in any way?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.441
You can get the Mitchum brothers
on the phone.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.567
Sure thing.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.112
They gave me
their personal number.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.114
I got it on speed dial.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.160
Hello.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.454
Yeah, t-this Brad?

29:06.579 --> 29:07.955
Oh, Rod.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.957
Listen, uh, hold on.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.375
Dougie's got to talk to you.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.546
Rod, I'm bringing my family
to the casino in 20 minutes.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.965
- <i>Meet us in the lobby.</i>
- Whatever you need, Dougie.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.217
And then I need a plane
to Spokane, Washington.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.635
<i>We're gassing up the jet.</i>

29:21.761 --> 29:23.137
We're gassing it up right now.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.681
Bradley, we're headed
to Spokane, Washington.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.516
<i>Meet you in the lobby
in 20 minutes.</i>

29:27.641 --> 29:28.684
You got it.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.687
Yeah.
Gas it up.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.481
- We're going to Spokane.
- Let's go.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.065
Meeting Dougie in the lobby.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.902
Girls, let's go
for a plane ride.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.654
Wonder what Dougie's up to now.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.657
Let's go!

29:43.783 --> 29:45.326
Hey!

29:45.451 --> 29:48.996
I have a feeling a man named
Gordon Cole will call here.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.874
If he does,
read him this message.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.675
You're a fine man,
Bushnell Mullins.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.428
I will not soon forget
your kindness and decency.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.350
What about the FBI?

30:09.475 --> 30:11.602
I am the FBI.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.692
Move over.
I'll drive.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.612
- But, Dougie‒
- Janey-E, it's okay.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.867
What's going on, Dougie?

30:26.992 --> 30:29.119
Fasten your seat belt.

31:05.906 --> 31:09.410
Janey-E, how do we get
to the Silver Mustang casino?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.412
You're not gonna start gambling
again, are you?

31:11.537 --> 31:13.789
We're going to see
the Mitchum brothers.

31:23.299 --> 31:24.758
Dad can drive...

31:24.884 --> 31:26.927
really good.

32:37.331 --> 32:38.791
I remember.

32:39.667 --> 32:40.668
Oh.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.379
Oh, Coop.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.965
I remember.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.396
I hope this works.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.095
You asked me about the night
that Cooper came to visit me.

35:41.390 --> 35:42.516
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.476
You want a drink?

35:45.269 --> 35:46.603
Yeah.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.481
Well...

36:32.399 --> 36:35.903
...it was three,
maybe four years after, uh...

36:36.028 --> 36:38.030
after I stopped hearing
from Cooper.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.118
I was still working
at the bureau.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.079
One night...

36:47.915 --> 36:49.166
...no knock...

36:51.043 --> 36:52.252
...no doorbell...

36:56.965 --> 36:58.133
...he just walked in.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.095
I was standing
in my living room.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.521
Oh, I was so happy to see him.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.073
I held him so close.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.536
And we, uh...

37:28.580 --> 37:30.207
We sat on my sofa.

37:33.502 --> 37:34.753
Started talking.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.884
I just wanted
to hear everything

37:41.009 --> 37:42.511
about where he'd been and...

37:45.097 --> 37:46.556
...what he'd been doing.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.859
He only wanted to know
about, uh...

37:57.985 --> 38:00.112
what had been going on
at the bureau.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.993
It felt like
he was grilling me.

38:11.123 --> 38:12.124
But I...

38:14.126 --> 38:15.877
...I told myself he was just...

38:17.796 --> 38:20.465
...he was just excited
to hear about bureau news.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.265
And then he leaned in.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.272
He leaned in...

38:36.982 --> 38:38.400
...leaned in to kiss me.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.571
It only happened once before.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.452
But as soon as...

38:52.539 --> 38:54.791
...as soon as his lips
touched mine...

38:58.503 --> 39:01.965
...something went wrong.

39:04.593 --> 39:06.345
And I felt afraid.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.017
And he saw the fear in me.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.907
And he smiled.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.203
He smiled.

39:33.914 --> 39:36.708
A-and his face...

39:39.711 --> 39:41.421
And that's when it started.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.592
He raped me.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.929
He raped me.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.441
Afterward,

40:01.566 --> 40:02.859
he took me somewhere.

40:04.486 --> 40:06.238
He took me somewhere like a...

40:08.073 --> 40:10.617
...an old gas station.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.953
Uh, old...

40:13.078 --> 40:14.621
an old gas station.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.607
I'm in the sheriff's station.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.283
I'm in the sheriff's station.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.581
I-I sent him those coordinates.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.750
I'm in the sheriff's station...

41:00.876 --> 41:02.127
because‒because...

41:11.011 --> 41:13.180
I'm not me.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.598
I-I'm not...

41:14.723 --> 41:16.766
I'm not me.

41:16.892 --> 41:18.435
I'm‒I'm‒I'm not.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.853
I'm not me.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.664
Wow.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.466
They're real.

41:49.591 --> 41:51.092
That was a real <i>tulpa.</i>

41:55.347 --> 41:56.806
Sheriff's station?

42:31.049 --> 42:32.050
I know.

42:33.385 --> 42:34.678
Fuck you.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.901
- Dougie!
- Oh.

43:32.027 --> 43:35.655
- You look great.
- You look good.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.991
We're all set.
The plane's standing by.

43:38.116 --> 43:39.451
Where are we going?

43:42.203 --> 43:43.663
Fellas, give me a moment.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.666
Janey-E, Sonny Jim,
come with me.

43:57.969 --> 44:01.139
You know, Dougie's talking
with a lot of assurance.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.226
Maybe something to do
with the coma?

44:09.064 --> 44:11.149
Side effects.

44:17.447 --> 44:19.324
I have to go away for a while.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.371
But I want to tell you
how much I've enjoyed

44:24.496 --> 44:26.414
spending time
with both of you.

44:29.167 --> 44:30.335
What?

44:31.670 --> 44:33.588
You've made my heart so full.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.093
What‒what are you saying?

44:42.722 --> 44:44.391
We're a family.

44:44.516 --> 44:45.934
Dougie‒I mean...

44:47.185 --> 44:48.645
I will be back.

44:53.525 --> 44:55.694
You're not Dougie?

44:57.445 --> 44:58.405
What?

44:59.531 --> 45:00.532
No.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.826
You're my dad.

45:02.951 --> 45:04.411
- You're my dad.
- Yeah.

45:05.787 --> 45:07.288
I'm your dad, Sonny Jim.

45:09.374 --> 45:11.751
I'm your dad,

45:11.876 --> 45:13.002
and I love you.

45:13.128 --> 45:14.254
I love you both.

45:29.561 --> 45:30.645
I have to go.

45:32.564 --> 45:33.732
You'll see me soon.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.443
I'll walk
through that red door,

45:36.568 --> 45:38.111
and I'll be home for good.

45:58.173 --> 45:59.174
Don't go.

46:03.303 --> 46:04.304
I have to.

46:24.532 --> 46:26.242
Whoever you are...

46:28.620 --> 46:29.913
...thank you.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.412
Dougie,
let me get this straight.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.373
Wait, wait, wait,
I want to hear this too.

47:13.498 --> 47:14.916
Candie, where's
my Bloody Mary?

47:20.088 --> 47:21.464
Mmm.

47:38.231 --> 47:39.232
Ahh.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.191
Okay.

47:40.859 --> 47:43.069
You don't sell insurance.

47:43.194 --> 47:44.404
You're an FBI agent...

47:45.780 --> 47:48.408
...who's been missing
for 25 years,

47:48.533 --> 47:53.288
and we need to get you to a town
called Twin Peaks,

47:53.413 --> 47:54.789
to a sheriff's station.

47:56.749 --> 47:57.876
Dougie...

47:59.127 --> 48:01.254
...we love you,

48:01.379 --> 48:03.798
but we are not
traditionally welcome

48:03.923 --> 48:05.300
at such places.

48:05.425 --> 48:07.635
Or by such
aforementioned people‒

48:07.760 --> 48:09.387
law enforcement types.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.348
I read you 100 percent.

48:13.558 --> 48:14.767
Friends,

48:14.893 --> 48:16.644
that's about to change.

48:16.769 --> 48:18.438
I am witness to the fact

48:18.563 --> 48:20.982
that you both
have hearts of gold.

48:22.609 --> 48:24.360
They do.

48:24.485 --> 48:26.237
They really do.
