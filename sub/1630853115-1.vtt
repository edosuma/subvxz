WEBVTT

00:22.188 --> 00:23.523
[horses neighing]

00:39.789 --> 00:41.291
[driver] Whoa. Whoa.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.173
-I just think it's important… No, no, no.
-[chattering]

00:48.256 --> 00:50.383
-Gregory, you…
-[indistinct chatter]

00:50.467 --> 00:53.261
Shh! Let her come out on her own.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.472
-Is this the plan?
-Thank goodness you're here.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.183
-She's requested time.
-We do not have time. Stand back.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.977
No offense, Sister, but you are
the last person she'd like to see.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.063
-What does that mean?
-Are we sure she's in there?

01:03.146 --> 01:05.190
-Of course she is.
-Where else would she be?

01:05.273 --> 01:07.901
-Climbed through the window, the chimney--
-Quiet! She may hear you.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.944
I left my husband
and child at home for this.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.530
I told everyone this would happen,
now we're late for the queen.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.531
I hear something.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.617
[muffled, distant chatter]

01:16.367 --> 01:18.078
-[groans]
-[Violet] Anthony.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.095
If one of you utters a single word…

01:37.430 --> 01:38.973
Let us get this over with.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.067
I yearn for someone fresh,
someone unexpected,

01:49.150 --> 01:51.194
to turn this season on its head.

01:51.277 --> 01:55.031
That is what we need.
There is no room for indifference.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.867
Apathy is a blight
the monarchy simply cannot endure.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.869
Of course, Your Majesty. But remember,

01:59.953 --> 02:02.080
a young lady cannot be a diamond

02:02.163 --> 02:04.666
until you anoint her as such.

02:04.749 --> 02:08.753
So if for any reason you do not find one
among the candidates today--

02:08.837 --> 02:10.296
Do you think she will return?

02:10.380 --> 02:12.924
We have heard nary a peep
from Lady Whistledown

02:13.007 --> 02:14.676
since last season ended.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.971
Perhaps the writer came to her senses.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.641
Perhaps she realized
taking on her queen was a bad idea,

02:21.724 --> 02:23.393
and she will never publish again.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.770
It is a convincing theory, ma'am.

02:25.854 --> 02:26.729
Or

02:27.355 --> 02:31.276
she simply left for the country,
as the rest of us did in the off-season,

02:31.359 --> 02:33.820
bored by the lack of any real gossip.

02:33.903 --> 02:34.904
[Lady Danbury] Hmm.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.325
You do know
what that would make her, then?

02:42.495 --> 02:43.788
One of us.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.914
[Lady Danbury] Hmm.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.960
[Prudence] Could we not have
appealed to the queen, Mama?

02:49.043 --> 02:51.504
After having mourned
dear Papa for so very long,

02:51.588 --> 02:53.423
perhaps Her Majesty
might extend a kindness

02:53.506 --> 02:55.216
and allow us to be presented again.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.135
I see no need
to go through all of that again

02:57.218 --> 02:59.637
when I myself am
already betrothed to Mr. Finch.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.848
Mr. Finch may very well
still change his mind.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.767
Particularly when he notices
there is still no dowry.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.645
Hush! The new Lord Featherington
shall see to that,

03:07.729 --> 03:10.231
when he finally decides
to show his miserly face.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.863
Just remember to remain composed.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.199
And control your emotions.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.827
Her Majesty does not take kindly
to any hint of hysterics.

03:23.411 --> 03:27.207
I found a small smile worked best
to appear open and approachable,

03:27.290 --> 03:29.042
but not too eager.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.919
Now, let us see it.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.129
No.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.547
She's practically melting.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.217
-Here. Allow me.
-[Violet] And your curtsy, dearest.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.552
Tell your sister
how you managed such balance.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.972
Simply locate a stationary object
and keep your eyes set.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.683
I used a painting nearby. We practiced it.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.894
-[Eloise whimpers]
-[Daphne] Several times.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.940
-You have natural gifts--
-Do not patronize me.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.733
-And give me that!
-[Francesca] Oh!

03:55.902 --> 03:58.321
My task this season
cannot be exceptionally difficult.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.490
Hastings did it after all.
How hard can it be?

04:00.573 --> 04:03.576
-Ah. Spoken with such feeling too.
-[Anthony] I do not need feeling.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.120
What I need is what I have,
and that is a list.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.624
Tolerable, dutiful,
suitable enough hips for childbearing,

04:09.707 --> 04:11.042
and at least half a brain.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.963
And that last part is not so much
a requirement but a preference, in fact.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
[man] Miss Cordelia Patridge.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.304
The Lady Abigail Evans.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.557
Miss Mary Ann Hallewell.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.893
Miss Margaret Goring.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.108
It is not too late.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.901
-You could say I collapsed.
-[chuckles]

04:36.985 --> 04:39.112
That I got something
unmentionable on my gown.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.905
All the feathers affected my senses.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.949
Anything, Mama,
to get me out of doing this.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.575
-My darling girl.
-[breathes shakily]

04:44.659 --> 04:47.704
No matter what,
you will always be a diamond to me.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.957
If Penelope were here…

04:52.041 --> 04:56.379
Penelope? How many times
must I warn you to be wary of that window?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.423
Do you wish to appear
like a befreckled beggar

04:58.506 --> 05:00.091
spending all day in the sun?

05:00.174 --> 05:01.926
-[chuckles]
-[Penelope] Of course not, Mama.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.386
My apologies.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.978
[man] The Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton

05:12.061 --> 05:14.772
and Miss Eloise Bridgerton.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.234
[Eloise breathes heavily]

05:23.990 --> 05:24.907
It is here.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.285
[breathing heavily]

05:29.746 --> 05:31.039
[whispers] Smile.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.050
What is the meaning of this?

05:47.221 --> 05:48.348
[chuckles lightly]

05:49.223 --> 05:50.099
I've seen enough.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.353
-[man] But Your Majesty, there are still--
-I have seen enough!

05:55.313 --> 05:56.647
Does this mean I can go?

05:56.731 --> 05:58.483
I don't know what this means.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.276
-[Violet mutters quietly]
-[gasps]

06:00.360 --> 06:01.319
Eloise.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.582
[chuckles]

06:15.291 --> 06:16.209
[scoffs lightly]

06:17.168 --> 06:19.879
Truly, I cannot say
I will long for any of this.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.924
Best of luck to you, Brother.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.927
You shall certainly need it this season.

06:29.263 --> 06:32.225
[Lady Whistledown] Dearest gentle reader.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.894
Did you miss me?

07:42.378 --> 07:46.299
[Lady Whistledown] As the members
of our esteemed ton lazily sojourned

07:46.382 --> 07:48.176
in their rustic retreats,

07:48.259 --> 07:51.429
this author was doing but one thing.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.973
I knew she would return!

07:54.056 --> 07:56.017
[Lady Whistledown] Honing my skills.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.560
Increased her price too, I see.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.855
[Lady Whistledown] Or should I say,
hatching my plans?

08:01.814 --> 08:04.108
Is she truly that good a writer?

08:04.192 --> 08:05.193
[light chuckle]

08:05.276 --> 08:07.653
[Lady Whistledown] No, even better.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.491
I was sharpening my knives…

08:12.783 --> 08:14.577
-"For all of you."
-…for all of you.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.080
How do you think she does it?

08:18.664 --> 08:21.250
Certainly not by herself.
[chuckles] How could she?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.168
[woman] Oh.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.523
Eighteen? We agreed on 20.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.399
[in Irish accent]
My mistress changed her mind.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.612
You're new to this arrangement,
so I'll say this only once.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.199
What my mistress wants, she gets.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.660
For whatever reason,
that would be you at the moment.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.663
That doesn't make you special, Mr. Harris.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.915
Printers in this town are ten-a-penny.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.583
But there's only one Lady Whistledown,

09:02.667 --> 09:05.002
and she could just as easily
take her business elsewhere.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.796
So it's 18,

09:06.879 --> 09:07.922
not a penny more.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.133
And the delivery boys
need a wage increase.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.220
They're running around town
while you get to sit on your lazy arse.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.013
Yes, ma'am.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.057
Then my mistress
thanks you for your services.

09:19.058 --> 09:24.313
[Lady Whistledown] Questions abound
as to this author's identity and means.

09:24.397 --> 09:29.068
Seeking those answers
shall prove fruitless, indeed.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.322
I am off to the market with my maid, Mama.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.616
I have just a tiny bit
of pin money left, and I--

09:36.826 --> 09:40.997
[Lady Whistledown] There is, of course,
another unknown identity at present.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.208
Though, this one
you will be able to unearth.

09:44.292 --> 09:48.879
I speak of the season's diamond,
wherever she may be.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.882
Your move, Your Majesty.

09:53.884 --> 09:56.220
[classical dance tune on piano]

10:05.187 --> 10:07.189
One and two. One and two.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.985
I do not think she's very good.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.070
-I believe she can hear you.
-I can hear you.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.866
-Ow! Watch my feet!
-Might we be done?

10:16.949 --> 10:20.995
If you are to catch the queen's eye after
that interruption, you must be perfection.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.372
I believe it was the interruption
that was perfection.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.084
Shocking that Eloise Bridgerton was not
named the season diamond, was it not?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.837
Was anyone else aware that
dear Colin has decided to add Albania

10:29.920 --> 10:32.673
or some such place to his itinerary
as he gads about the world?

10:32.757 --> 10:35.468
No. But how happy for him
that he can simply decide to do that.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.844
Joining us for tea, Anthony?

10:36.927 --> 10:40.264
Uh, I'm afraid I must pass.
Too many calls on my funds today.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.767
Now that the season has started,

10:42.850 --> 10:46.896
I need to fill your coffers at the modiste
and oversee the hiring of extra staff.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.856
Your ring.
When you get the chance, I need it.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.567
The fields by Ferryhallow.
I was thinking we might hold off

10:51.651 --> 10:53.319
on leasing them due to the hard frost.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.737
I beg your pardon?

10:54.820 --> 10:56.864
The frost hardens the soil,
saps it of nutrients.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.450
That is very well.
But you requested my ring?

10:59.533 --> 11:00.826
Father's betrothal ring.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.954
Did someone catch your eye
at the presentation, Brother?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.915
I thought all the young ladies
looked beautiful.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.751
Not particularly. And all the young ladies
looked the same. Like ladies.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.712
I'd simply like to be prepared
for when the opportunity presents itself.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.630
The opportunity?

11:12.713 --> 11:15.966
I've compiled an index of the season's
eligible misses and arranged interviews.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.302
[chuckling] Interviews! [inhales]

11:19.553 --> 11:23.224
Dearest, I shall be more than happy
to give you my ring when you find someone

11:23.307 --> 11:25.142
with whom you are very much in love.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.728
Besides, it is
in safekeeping at Aubrey Hall.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.064
-Very well.
-See that he is quite well.

11:30.147 --> 11:30.981
Me?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.483
I'm not in need of coddling.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.736
I assure you all, everything is in order.

11:36.904 --> 11:41.200
[classical rendition
of "Stay Away" playing]

11:49.709 --> 11:51.460
Are you looking forward to being a mother?

11:51.544 --> 11:54.839
Oh, very much. I am quite close
with my brothers and sisters.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.132
I love children.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.800
What number do you have in mind?

11:58.384 --> 11:59.385
Of children?

11:59.927 --> 12:03.514
Four. Or five. No. Perhaps six.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.975
Three children is what
I have always wanted, my lord.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.102
If your daughter had
a penchant for overspending,

12:08.185 --> 12:09.395
how would you deal with that?

12:09.478 --> 12:11.731
[whimsical classical music continues]

12:14.859 --> 12:17.862
We must secure a new lady's maid
for Eloise, now that she is out.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.865
Ensure she is even more
strong-willed than the last.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.033
-[clears throat]
-What are those?

12:23.117 --> 12:26.245
Uh, accounts requiring
your signature, my lord.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.832
The harp is
a wonderful instrument, my lord,

12:29.915 --> 12:32.710
teaching one patience, strength,

12:32.793 --> 12:36.297
and an appreciation for beauty,
of course. [chuckles]

12:37.256 --> 12:38.257
But do you read?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.092
Books?

12:44.597 --> 12:45.598
[exhales deeply]

12:59.820 --> 13:02.948
I am fluent in French, Italian, Latin.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.075
And your Greek?

13:08.037 --> 13:11.123
Apologies, my lord.
I much prefer a quadrille.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.084
I ride. I paint.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.378
I sing. I dance.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.839
I can divide and multiply.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.966
I even construct my own hats.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.865
Five and twenty more, my lord.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.328
[coins clattering]

13:57.127 --> 13:59.463
[whimsical classical music fades]

14:01.382 --> 14:02.633
[quacking]

14:06.303 --> 14:07.847
[horse snorts]

14:12.017 --> 14:13.185
[distant horse neighs]

14:15.229 --> 14:16.063
Whoa, there!

14:16.146 --> 14:18.315
Miss, are you in trouble?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.109
-[horse neighing]
-Come on.

14:41.755 --> 14:42.631
Come on.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.273
Careful, now!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.026
Whoa, there!

15:05.195 --> 15:06.155
[horse snorts]

15:06.864 --> 15:08.866
[distant horse neighs]

15:21.337 --> 15:23.505
[panting softly]

15:24.214 --> 15:25.549
[horse nickers]

15:26.425 --> 15:27.384
[sighs]

15:28.677 --> 15:29.720
Enjoying your victory lap?

15:29.803 --> 15:30.930
[speaks Hindi]

15:31.430 --> 15:34.391
You'll not be afforded
such an ample head-start this time.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.143
Apologies, sir.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.063
I did not mean to cause anyone concern.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.315
Does your maid know
you are riding astride?

15:41.398 --> 15:42.733
I have no maid.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.026
Then you're married.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.029
Forgive me.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.031
Then you are lost.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.325
I am not lost either.
I'm on my way back to Mayfair.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.202
-It is just ahead.
-Mayfair?

15:54.745 --> 15:55.579
Well, then--

15:55.663 --> 15:58.374
I appreciate your attention, sir,
but I assure you I am perfectly safe.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.751
Perhaps we pretend
this encounter never took place?

16:00.834 --> 16:02.878
You allow me to go my way,
and you go yours.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.422
You worry about being seen.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.967
I worry about meeting
strange men in parks at dawn

16:08.050 --> 16:10.219
who fail to leave me alone
with their questions.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.137
Your secret is safe.
I shall not tell a soul.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.263
How grateful I am.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.892
Losing races to strange women
in such parks at dawn.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.479
I can only imagine
the questions I would be asked.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.814
[both chuckle lightly]

16:22.314 --> 16:23.732
Is that what that was?

16:24.733 --> 16:26.527
-A race?
-Was it not?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.946
Does one not need
actual competition for a race?

16:29.029 --> 16:31.156
If we had decided
on a finish line together,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.117
but alas, we made no such agreement.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.827
I see you are not one for losing.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.620
I shall have you--

16:39.248 --> 16:42.292
In the rare instances it occurs,

16:42.376 --> 16:44.628
I'd admit that I have
either lost or am in the wrong.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.505
But I'm afraid
the same cannot be said for you.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.799
-I beg your pardon?
-Mayfair is not right ahead.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.175
It's the other way entirely.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.885
[men chattering]

16:51.969 --> 16:53.637
[Anthony] Not lost, you said?

16:57.099 --> 16:58.892
-Good day, sir.
-[horse snorts]

16:58.976 --> 16:59.977
Let's go.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.188
We have not yet been introduced.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.608
I am afraid that is not possible.
Not when I have a victory lap to enjoy.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.568
[chuckles]

17:08.444 --> 17:10.362
[horse whinnies]

17:19.663 --> 17:22.166
Well, what do you mean
she was not in her room?

17:22.249 --> 17:25.127
I went to find her after awakening,
but she was not there.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.007
[Lady Danbury] Lady Mary.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.676
Lady Danbury.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.721
Oh, how delightful it is to see you.

17:35.804 --> 17:36.930
And you.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.059
-After all these years.
-[chuckles softly]

17:41.060 --> 17:42.436
You look well.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.065
Allow me to introduce to you my youngest,

17:46.148 --> 17:48.067
-Miss Edwina Sharma.
-Ah.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.319
[Edwina] A true pleasure, Lady Danbury.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.946
I am so grateful for your hospitality.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.991
Your home, it is magnificent.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.410
Consider it yours for the season.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.538
Though, I was expecting another?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.665
Yes. My eldest.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.708
Kate.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.251
Kate. Yes.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.672
Well, she did get off the ship
with you last night, did she not?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.841
-Apologies.
-[Edwina] Kate!

18:12.925 --> 18:15.677
-There you are, dearest.
-I hope I did not keep you waiting long.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.097
The gardens here are so lovely.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.973
After such a lengthy journey,

18:20.057 --> 18:23.185
I found that I wanted
some freshness and morning air.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.395
But, uh… [clears throat] I am here now.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.732
My eldest, Lady Danbury. Miss Kate Sharma.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.109
[Lady Danbury] Hmm.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.277
Well, now that we are all arrived--

18:32.361 --> 18:33.362
[Kate] Almost.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.696
I beg your pardon?

18:34.780 --> 18:37.783
We have almost all arrived.
There is also Newton.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.701
Is he still upstairs?

18:40.744 --> 18:41.620
[chuckles softly]

18:41.703 --> 18:43.747
[panting]

18:45.332 --> 18:49.211
Mama tells us you host the first ball
of every season, Lady Danbury.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.506
Yes. I have appropriated a conservatory

18:52.589 --> 18:54.550
for this year's festivities.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.968
Did you hear that, Edwina?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.512
Well, that sounds delightful.

18:58.595 --> 19:02.474
It will make for a most spectacular
entrance to society, indeed.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.935
I cannot tell you
how eager the young ladies are

19:05.018 --> 19:06.228
for the upcoming season.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.479
As am I.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.191
I would've ensured their presentation
to Her Majesty the Queen,

19:11.275 --> 19:14.736
but I thought it wise for me
to examine their deportment

19:14.820 --> 19:16.738
prior to their first engagement.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.200
Her Majesty is most discerning,
you understand.

19:20.784 --> 19:24.204
So Her Majesty will be
in attendance, then, at the ball?

19:24.288 --> 19:26.915
Well, there is no reason
for concern, Lady Mary.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.293
You will be with me, after all.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.044
Of course.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.463
Now, I have made all the arrangements.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.175
The pianoforte is tuned,
the instructors hired.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.843
Dance lessons begin at noon,

19:37.926 --> 19:39.970
followed by a short
but comprehensive visit

19:40.053 --> 19:42.389
from a lovely French tutor I have secured.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.933
Well, stand up.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.478
Both of you. Could you, uh-- [chuckles]

19:49.146 --> 19:50.731
[dog whimpers]

19:56.236 --> 19:58.614
Exceptional posture.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.824
Beautiful smiles.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.492
Yes, they are, quite.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.579
The age of the elder miss
may raise concern.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.874
Any suitable gentleman
will require some persuading,

20:08.957 --> 20:10.792
whether we like it or not,

20:10.876 --> 20:15.130
as she will already be regarded
as an old maid at the mature age of…

20:15.214 --> 20:16.673
Six and twenty, ma'am.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.551
But it should truly be
of no concern, as I assure you

20:19.635 --> 20:21.970
I am not here
to find a husband for myself,

20:22.054 --> 20:24.848
only for my sister,
who, indeed, stands quite tall

20:24.932 --> 20:26.975
and smiles rather exquisitely.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.770
Even more so
when she speaks French, I rather think.

20:32.481 --> 20:36.235
[speaks French]

20:36.318 --> 20:38.612
[Kate] She is accomplished
in both Latin and Greek,

20:38.695 --> 20:40.948
in addition to Marathi
and Hindustani, of course.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.576
She not only plays sitar
and maruli, but pianoforte too.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.120
And as for her dancing, well,

20:47.204 --> 20:49.873
it is quite remarkable,
if I do say so myself.

20:49.957 --> 20:50.999
And I do say so,

20:51.083 --> 20:55.879
considering it was I who taught my sister
the cotillion, the quadrille, the waltz.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.132
Self-taught, naturally,
but still quite remarkable nonetheless.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.300
Hmm! Well--

21:00.384 --> 21:04.221
Kate feels quite passionately
about her sister's prospects this season.

21:04.304 --> 21:07.849
I hope you did not go to too much trouble,
finding all of those instructors?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.101
Not at all.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.603
My mama did not err
in her description of you,

21:11.687 --> 21:14.481
a woman of such grace and kindness.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.775
I am sure we have much to learn from you,

21:16.858 --> 21:20.946
such as the preparation
of this most excellent tea.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.489
[Lady Mary chuckles nervously]

21:23.407 --> 21:24.700
-Kate, dear?
-Mm-hmm?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.326
Might Newton require a walk

21:26.410 --> 21:30.247
before he makes his mess
all over these fine carpets?

21:30.330 --> 21:33.834
Indeed. Delighted
to make your acquaintance, Lady Danbury.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.087
My sister and I do look forward
to your sponsorship this season.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.213
[dog barks]

21:40.716 --> 21:43.719
Daphne provided me
a list of recommendations

21:43.802 --> 21:45.304
for a successful season.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.807
Private advice regarding
the top ten ways in which to entrap a man.

21:48.890 --> 21:49.766
I'm telling you, Pen,

21:49.850 --> 21:52.769
the season has barely begun
and already I feel touched in the head.

21:52.853 --> 21:53.937
[Penelope laughs]

21:54.021 --> 21:57.649
Another quill? You do get
through them at an extraordinary rate.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.153
I have been busy with my correspondence.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.363
-To the new heir? Is he here yet?
-No.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.364
Oh.

22:04.448 --> 22:08.368
I only mean, Colin has been keeping me
informed of his adventures in Greece.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.079
In fairness, I have stopped
reading his letters. He rambles.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.165
-He's certainly no Lady Whistledown.
-No.

22:14.124 --> 22:17.210
But, then again, Colin has,
in fact, been somewhere, unlike her.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.671
Well, I thought you revered Whistledown.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.299
Did her arrival not save you
from your presentation to the queen?

22:22.382 --> 22:24.843
I was delighted
by the diversion, to be sure. But,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.803
I sat with her paper all morning,

22:26.887 --> 22:29.348
and in truth, all she does
is repeat what she hears.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.184
Someone must report the gossip.
Does she not have a way with words?

22:32.267 --> 22:33.810
But what is she saying with those words?

22:34.770 --> 22:37.272
Truly, I did not mind
Whistledown's silence the last ten months,

22:37.356 --> 22:40.233
as it finally gave me some time
to read a few articles of substance.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.318
[clears throat]

22:41.401 --> 22:45.530
"My own sex, I hope, will excuse me
if I treat them like rational creatures,

22:45.614 --> 22:48.116
instead of flattering
their fascinating graces."

22:48.200 --> 22:49.201
Wollstonecraft.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.703
Rather haughty.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.705
Imagine if Whistledown wrote like this,

22:53.789 --> 22:57.876
instead of simply turning our eye
to every newly-minted debutante.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.586
Perhaps then we might find our respite

22:59.669 --> 23:01.838
from the tedious sequence
of tea parties and balls.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.008
I rather think the only reason
Whistledown writes about such things

23:05.092 --> 23:07.511
is because she is not
an active participant in them.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.971
Oh. Everyone has their theory, I suppose.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.014
[Eloise] Mmm.

23:13.058 --> 23:17.020
Would you like me to prepare some potatoes
for the ladies downstairs, ma'am?

23:17.104 --> 23:18.563
Potatoes? Again?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.732
Why are we always eating potatoes?

23:20.816 --> 23:25.404
Because these days, I am the housekeeper,
lady's maid, scullery maid, and cook.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.155
Have all the staff truly departed?

23:27.239 --> 23:29.616
Though I am quite good at boiling the veg.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.119
Thank you, Mrs. Varley.
Potatoes would be lovely.

23:32.202 --> 23:35.247
A season with no new dresses,
nor servants.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.707
Are we to empty our own chamber pots too?

23:37.791 --> 23:39.668
-Mama, I cannot do that.
-Calm yourselves.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.338
As I have told you,
once the new Lord Featherington arrives,

23:43.422 --> 23:44.798
we will be provided for.

23:44.881 --> 23:48.218
Well, where is he?
Why is he taking so long?

23:48.301 --> 23:51.346
Because he wishes to make us suffer.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.140
[sighs]

23:53.640 --> 23:55.809
The new Lord Featherington
is off somewhere,

23:55.892 --> 23:57.561
delighting in our misfortune,

23:57.644 --> 23:59.521
because the man is as cruel as can be.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.065
I hear he cast his only son
out to the Americas

24:02.149 --> 24:03.859
for daring to question his word.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.362
I tremble to think where he will send
the rest of us if he has a mind.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.613
Cornwall, perhaps.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.282
Cornwall?

24:10.365 --> 24:13.743
Well, I suppose
you may visit Mr. Finch and me.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.745
If there is nary a penny
for new dresses or staff,

24:15.829 --> 24:16.997
there is none for her dowry.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.207
He shall prevent me from marrying?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.417
Of course not.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.628
The man may be an old,
bitter curmudgeon, but he is a gentleman

24:23.712 --> 24:25.797
and he will keep a gentleman's agreement.

24:25.881 --> 24:30.427
Which is why we must waste no time
in finding matches for the lot of you.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.846
Unless you are all betrothed
by the time our cousin arrives

24:32.929 --> 24:36.266
to claim the Featherington estate,
we shall be at his mercy.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.768
And then… heaven help us all.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.024
You could always sell the silverware.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.068
The dinner service
should fetch a handsome price.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.919
Are you thinking of wearing that one?

25:04.419 --> 25:06.421
-[sighs]
-It is quite beautiful.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.298
No. These are for you, Bon.

25:08.381 --> 25:11.051
We have come to London
to find your husband, not mine.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.261
Yes. You are but a dear old maid.

25:13.345 --> 25:18.058
Ah. Who shall be perfectly happy doting on
my many nieces and nephews one day soon.

25:18.141 --> 25:21.728
I shall spoil them exceedingly.
You do know that, yes?

25:24.147 --> 25:25.106
What is it?

25:26.900 --> 25:27.734
I…

25:29.736 --> 25:32.030
only hope they like me tonight.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.574
How could they not?

25:37.619 --> 25:41.039
[sighs] Mama is doing that thing
she always does when she is worried.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.375
The gossip she endured after marrying Appa

25:43.458 --> 25:45.377
had to have been unbearable,
do you not think?

25:45.460 --> 25:48.713
Is this what troubles you?
That was many years ago.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.799
Everyone will still have questions.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.593
About our family.
About how you and I are related.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.554
We are sisters.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.889
This place may feel different,

25:57.973 --> 26:01.017
but it will never change
the way you and I see each other.

26:01.977 --> 26:06.273
Besides, you heard Lady Danbury.
She will smooth everything over.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.899
She is on our side.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.945
[sighs] The dowager is
more formidable than I imagined.

26:12.737 --> 26:16.408
She will have your head when she learns
of your secret morning ride.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.743
Are you certain no one saw you?

26:18.827 --> 26:20.245
Yes. Now, never mind her.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.872
The dowager is not half as frightening
as she thinks she is.

26:22.956 --> 26:23.790
[chuckles]

26:24.666 --> 26:26.793
You must be excited.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.921
This is the first chapter
of a happy story.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.631
All you have to do this evening

26:31.715 --> 26:33.842
is remember
what it is you are looking for.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.468
Hmm.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.178
-Someone charming.
-Mm-hmm.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.473
And handsome, of course.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.350
A prince or a duke, perhaps.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.312
It is not a man's appearance
or title that will woo you.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.231
It is his mind and spirit
that will court yours.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.943
He will speak in a manner
that only your heart can hear.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.031
That is what you are looking for.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.658
That is the true love you deserve.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.788
[inhales]

27:07.250 --> 27:08.168
This one?

27:08.710 --> 27:10.837
-They will not be ready.
-[Edwina chuckles]

27:10.920 --> 27:12.047
[Kate chuckles]

27:12.130 --> 27:15.133
[classical rendition
of "Material Girl" playing]

27:40.825 --> 27:43.161
Just remember to breathe, Bon.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.329
[gasps softly] Ah.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.709
The Marquis of Ashdown.

27:49.793 --> 27:53.546
A little young, to be sure,
but he has 10,000 a year.

27:54.130 --> 27:58.093
The Earl of Gloucester.
His wife recently died of influenza.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.012
He might make
a particularly estimable addition

28:01.096 --> 28:02.889
to your dance card
this evening, Miss Sharma.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.850
I will not be taking
to the floor tonight, Lady Danbury.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.603
Is there someone back home
you've yet to tell me about?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.522
Come now. I am long past all of that.

28:10.605 --> 28:13.650
The only match I am interested in
is for my sister.

28:13.733 --> 28:17.445
She trusts me implicitly.
Now, what about the Duke of Suffolk?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.240
According to Debrett's,
he should be quite the catch this year.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.242
The duke flaunts his mistresses.

28:22.325 --> 28:25.954
I assure you, Miss Sharma,
I have our prospects well in hand.

28:26.037 --> 28:26.996
[gasps softly] Ah.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.873
There she is.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.337
So many flowers,

28:35.213 --> 28:37.632
when what I really seek is a gem.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.426
Oh.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.594
So soon, Lady Danbury?

28:44.514 --> 28:48.059
Lady Danbury.
A delightful soiree, as expected.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.479
Though my own later this week
will be much more exclusive.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.733
Your Majesty,
I would not think to compare.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.234
And rightly so.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.612
Your Majesty,
may I present Lady Mary Sharma,

28:59.696 --> 29:01.448
whom you must remember.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.742
And may I present her daughters,

29:03.825 --> 29:07.036
Miss Sharma and Miss Edwina Sharma,

29:07.120 --> 29:09.914
my personal special guests for the season.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.750
A high honor, indeed.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.043
I hear you have made quite a journey

29:14.127 --> 29:16.796
to join us again
after all these years, Lady Mary.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.757
If only you had extended the courtesy

29:18.840 --> 29:21.718
of offering your queen
a final farewell before you left.

29:25.889 --> 29:29.976
Oh, I do relish a challenge.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.566
[song ends]

29:39.444 --> 29:40.820
[Violet chuckles]

29:41.404 --> 29:42.405
[Eloise sighs]

29:43.198 --> 29:45.241
Stop fussing with your dress.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.326
You look lovely, dear.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.453
I look like a prize calf,
trussed up for auction.

29:48.536 --> 29:49.746
[Benedict moos]

29:49.829 --> 29:51.456
Even Daphne felt most apprehensive

29:51.539 --> 29:54.292
at her first official ball,
and look how well her season turned out.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.210
Oh, right.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.586
[Violet chuckles] Oh.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.672
Come, Sister. The cakes
at these occasions are surprisingly good.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.466
[hesitates] Uh… Uh…

30:04.552 --> 30:06.596
It truly is a sparse crop.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.682
Oh, I am sure there is
someone here who will charm you.

30:10.475 --> 30:14.896
After all, this is the season
the viscount intends to find a wife.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.983
-You honestly just did that?
-I believe I did.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.819
-Lady Bridgerton.
-[Violet chuckles]

30:20.902 --> 30:22.237
Lord Bridgerton.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.614
-Dance, please, Lord Bridgerton?
-[Anthony] Good evening.

30:25.114 --> 30:27.492
[classical music playing]

30:29.619 --> 30:32.413
Is that Lady Mary Sheffield Sharma?

30:32.497 --> 30:34.916
I can't believe
she would show her face here again.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.626
A scandal, Mama?

30:36.709 --> 30:39.087
Lady Mary was
the incomparable of our season,

30:39.170 --> 30:42.841
until she fell in love with
and married some kind of clerk, I hear.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.385
The two of them
absconded to India thereafter.

30:45.468 --> 30:48.638
A maharajah I would have understood,

30:48.721 --> 30:52.684
but the man was no more than
a common worker who already had a child.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.060
That must be her.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.478
The older one.

30:55.562 --> 30:59.148
Lady Mary's parents, the Sheffields,
never lived down the shame, did they?

30:59.232 --> 31:01.526
Too ashamed to show their faces in London.

31:01.609 --> 31:04.320
If only every family
could be as respectable as ours.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.614
[chuckles softly] Yes, Lady Featherington?

31:09.826 --> 31:11.286
[gasps softly] Dearest!

31:11.369 --> 31:12.328
My love.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.253
Hmm.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.297
Mr. and Mrs. Finch.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.632
Lady Featherington.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.760
It is a delightful surprise
to see you in attendance.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.430
After such a long mourning period.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.224
Almost as long as our son
has been courting Philippa,

31:33.308 --> 31:34.851
if you can imagine.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.019
[chuckles] Yes.

31:36.603 --> 31:39.731
It has been a difficult time, indeed.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.400
Darkness has been our candle
in recent months.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.402
Mmm. Have you come unaccompanied?

31:44.485 --> 31:46.613
Or has the new heir finally come to manage

31:46.696 --> 31:48.948
this unsettled business
of your daughter's dowry?

31:51.868 --> 31:54.746
"Unsettled."
That is the precise word, Mr. Finch,

31:54.829 --> 31:57.081
because I, too, have been… [sighs]

31:57.165 --> 31:59.125
…very unsettled, indeed.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.795
Shaken to the bone, in fact, by…

32:02.879 --> 32:04.505
[tearfully] …by grief.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.800
Missing my dear, dear, very dead husband.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.094
-[feigns sobbing]
-I told you it was too soon!

32:10.178 --> 32:12.597
You told me you wished
for the boy to be out of the house!

32:14.223 --> 32:17.101
Our apologies, Lady Featherington.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.855
Do let us know when you are more… settled.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.357
-Yes?
-[feigns sobbing]

32:23.566 --> 32:24.567
[sniffles]

32:34.535 --> 32:35.536
[song ends]

32:35.620 --> 32:36.955
-Number eight?
-Yes.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.498
I know that gentleman.

32:38.998 --> 32:41.250
-Who?
-The viscount?

32:41.834 --> 32:44.963
I do not believe
I have yet made an introduction.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.089
Of course.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.549
It must be my mistake.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.677
Though you have quite the eye.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.055
Viscount Bridgerton is
wealthy, well-connected,

32:54.138 --> 32:57.433
and from one of the ton's
most illustrious families.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.560
Apparently hoping to marry this season,

32:59.644 --> 33:03.773
he may very well be
our most eligible bachelor, indeed.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.149
He is very handsome.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.109
Yes.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.695
I suppose he is.

33:09.445 --> 33:13.658
Lord Corning.
I was hoping to see you this evening.

33:13.741 --> 33:17.203
Allow me to introduce Miss Sharma

33:17.745 --> 33:20.164
and Miss Edwina Sharma.

33:20.790 --> 33:24.293
It is a pleasure. Miss Edwina,
would you honor me with a dance?

33:24.377 --> 33:25.670
Corning, you said?

33:25.753 --> 33:27.380
The Baron Corning.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.011
I would be delighted, my lord.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.723
[classical music plays]

33:38.641 --> 33:41.853
I do not recall reading
of Corning's family in my research.

33:41.936 --> 33:45.273
It does not matter
what you have and have not read.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.400
It is unacceptable here

33:47.483 --> 33:49.777
for a lady to decline
a dance with a gentleman

33:49.861 --> 33:52.655
unless she's already reserved by another.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.992
I see we have much to learn.

33:56.075 --> 33:57.076
[cane taps]

34:04.625 --> 34:05.752
Spanish dance?

34:05.835 --> 34:07.628
[indistinct conversation]

34:11.674 --> 34:14.469
And they say
Millerson has a whelp in the country.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.304
Spitting image of his father.

34:18.806 --> 34:19.807
There you are.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.977
Oh, Pen, I'm so glad to see you.
Mama is already being insufferable.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.521
At least she did not see fit
to dress you as a sunflower.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.732
I declare a bee
might mistake me for the real thing.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.735
Miss Bridgerton.
May I request your next dance?

34:30.818 --> 34:32.737
Or I might accompany you
to fetch some lemonade?

34:32.820 --> 34:34.864
-You seem parched.
-How can you tell? Is she wilting?

34:34.947 --> 34:36.074
Or punch, if you prefer?

34:36.157 --> 34:38.367
-A plant pun, if you're wondering.
-Apologies, gentlemen.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.912
I regret to inform you
that my dance card is already full.

34:40.995 --> 34:41.996
[clears throat]

34:45.875 --> 34:48.961
Lord Byron? Wellington?
Eloise, these names are false!

34:49.045 --> 34:51.339
I am merely following
my sister's valuable advice.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.341
She told me that it is
of the utmost importance

34:53.424 --> 34:55.968
for a lady's dance card
to be filled with all of the right names.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.428
-[both laugh]
-[Violet] Eloise?

34:57.512 --> 34:59.430
There you are, dear. [chuckles]

34:59.514 --> 35:02.100
Come. There is someone
I would like you to meet.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.434
[Eloise groans softly]

35:05.686 --> 35:08.731
[classical rendition
of "Diamonds" playing]

36:03.744 --> 36:05.538
-[exhales deeply]
-[man] Bridgerton!

36:11.043 --> 36:12.378
I owe you a drink.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.337
Whatever for?

36:13.421 --> 36:16.799
With you as the prize catch of the season,
the rest of us shall receive a respite

36:16.883 --> 36:19.218
from the marriage-minded mamas
this season, indeed.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.345
Enjoy your freedom while it lasts.

36:21.429 --> 36:24.599
You, too, will soon submit
to this ridiculous rigmarole of courtship.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.978
Squiring every eligible miss around town
until you're barely able to see straight.

36:29.061 --> 36:31.147
Is one lady unlike any other?

36:31.230 --> 36:34.442
Simply pick the least objectionable
and get her wed, bed, and bred.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.903
Then you can return
to more pleasurable pursuits.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.322
And more pleasurable partners. [chuckles]

36:39.405 --> 36:42.241
You may be cavalier, but if I must
leg-shackle myself in marriage,

36:42.700 --> 36:44.994
the lady in question
should have more to recommend her.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.871
Do not tell us
you are hoping for a love match?

36:46.954 --> 36:48.581
[Anthony] Love is the last thing I desire.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.958
But if my children
are to be of good stock,

36:51.042 --> 36:53.419
then their mother must be
of impeccable quality.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.671
A pleasing face, an acceptable wit,

36:56.422 --> 36:58.633
genteel manners enough
to credit a viscountess.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.884
It should not be hard to find.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.346
And yet, the debutantes of London
fall short at every turn.

37:03.429 --> 37:06.891
You want the best. Perhaps the queen
will finally name a diamond.

37:06.974 --> 37:09.602
Save you some trouble.
At least, of choosing her.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.771
Wooing the piece
will be a different story, indeed.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.272
I shall have no problem there.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.815
[all chuckle]

37:16.150 --> 37:18.402
-Smoking room, gentlemen?
-I shall be there anon.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.122
[clattering]

37:31.290 --> 37:32.500
[Anthony] Is someone there?

37:38.005 --> 37:39.048
I can hear y…

37:42.468 --> 37:43.302
you.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.513
Pardon me, my lord.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.598
I never got your name.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.434
I was wondering if we'd meet again.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.603
So you might discern
if my wit is acceptable,

37:52.687 --> 37:53.729
my manners genteel?

37:54.605 --> 37:55.690
You were eavesdropping?

37:55.773 --> 37:56.983
It was hardly an effort,

37:57.066 --> 37:59.860
seeing as you were proclaiming
your many requirements for a wife

37:59.944 --> 38:01.654
loud enough for the entire party to hear.

38:01.737 --> 38:02.822
You take issue with them?

38:02.905 --> 38:06.117
I take issue with any man who views women
merely as chattels and breeding stock.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.159
None of that was meant--

38:07.243 --> 38:08.661
Viscount Bridgerton, yes?

38:08.744 --> 38:11.080
When you manage to find
this paragon of virtue,

38:11.163 --> 38:14.000
whatever makes you think
she will accept your suit?

38:14.083 --> 38:17.169
Are the young ladies of London
truly so easily won

38:17.253 --> 38:19.672
by a pleasing smile
and absolutely nothing more?

38:19.755 --> 38:21.215
So, you find my smile pleasing.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.259
I find your opinion
of yourself entirely too high.

38:23.843 --> 38:27.054
Your character is
as deficient as your horsemanship.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.597
I shall bid you good night.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.409
[Eloise] Ah. Pen!

38:48.993 --> 38:50.995
Pen. Are you going somewhere?

38:51.078 --> 38:55.374
I was… just getting some air.
It is so very stifling in the ballroom.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.417
[scoffs]

38:56.500 --> 38:59.045
-The air or the dreary conversation?
-[chuckles]

38:59.670 --> 39:01.964
I do suppose this is
the one benefit of being out.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.967
I have you to run off with.
We shall never have to be alone.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.093
[chuckles]

39:06.635 --> 39:08.220
My thoughts exactly.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.353
Have you seen your brother or your sister?

39:15.436 --> 39:17.646
They managed to escape you? Good for them.

39:20.566 --> 39:23.736
Lady Danbury. [chuckles] Splendid evening.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.404
For the most part.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.532
There are a few guests whose absence
I might not have regretted.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.618
[laughs] I do hope I am not one of them.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.371
You and I have
common interests this season, it seems.

39:33.454 --> 39:36.040
I heard. Your wards,
I look forward to meeting them.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.376
And I look forward
to showing these other mamas

39:38.459 --> 39:40.336
how the game ought to be played.

39:40.419 --> 39:43.923
Though, it appears you have already
stoked the fire by informing them

39:44.006 --> 39:46.384
of the viscount's intentions
for this season.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.886
My son said he was ready.
Who am I to question it?

39:48.969 --> 39:51.097
They all must come around
eventually, I suppose.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.640
Lady Danbury, we wish to leave.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.433
Miss Sharma, allow me to introduce you--

39:54.517 --> 39:56.894
Charmed. My mama
is already in our carriage.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.312
We will see you at home.

39:59.021 --> 40:02.358
People are watching, my dear.
You are clearly upset--

40:02.441 --> 40:04.860
What is clear is
we are woefully unprepared

40:04.944 --> 40:07.822
to navigate this lion's den.
I am sure Edwina's absence

40:07.905 --> 40:10.074
will only make her
that much more desirable.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.702
It truly was
a magnificent soiree, Lady Danbury.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.371
We are most grateful.

40:18.749 --> 40:19.667
Well,

40:20.251 --> 40:23.295
it would seem both of us
may have our hands full this year.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.423
Not if I have something to say about it.

40:25.506 --> 40:30.177
And as you very well know,
I always have something to say.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.178
[chuckles softly]

40:33.347 --> 40:35.057
Delightful evening, Mama!

40:35.141 --> 40:36.225
Night, Sisters!

40:36.308 --> 40:38.060
[Lady Featherington]
Good night, young ladies!

40:38.561 --> 40:39.562
[doors closing]

40:42.481 --> 40:43.899
[breathing heavily]

40:44.400 --> 40:45.359
[sighs]

41:30.404 --> 41:32.448
-Can you go any faster?
-[driver] Yes, miss!

41:41.999 --> 41:44.251
Lawks, I thought you weren't coming.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.629
[in Irish accent] My mistress
apologizes for the delay.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.589
This is for today.
It must print before noon.

41:48.672 --> 41:49.757
[scoffs]

41:51.675 --> 41:53.260
Last edition's takings, yes?

41:54.011 --> 41:57.097
800 copies at five pence apiece,
sold for eight pence each,

41:57.181 --> 42:00.392
minus the delivery boys' wages,
there should be eleven pounds,

42:00.476 --> 42:01.936
two shillings here altogether.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.230
My mistress
is willing to take an even ten.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.815
You get to keep the surplus
for your rapid service.

42:06.899 --> 42:11.445
These delays will be more frequent now
due to an… unforeseen circumstance,

42:11.529 --> 42:13.239
so, it's really a bargain.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.871
[Lady Whistledown]
There is nothing quite like

42:20.955 --> 42:24.291
the sweet-scented smell of success.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.753
But after taking in the scene
from last night's festivities,

42:27.836 --> 42:32.174
it is clear the season won't be
quite so fragrant for everyone.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.347
The Viscount Bridgerton's own mama

42:38.430 --> 42:41.183
may have loudly declared her eldest son's

42:41.267 --> 42:43.185
lofty intentions to marry,

42:43.811 --> 42:46.397
yet I cannot be the only one wondering

42:46.480 --> 42:49.692
if this former Capital-R-Rake

42:49.775 --> 42:52.444
is, indeed, ready to flourish.

42:55.489 --> 42:58.492
Perhaps the viscount, like the rest of us,

42:58.576 --> 43:03.372
is simply waiting for the queen
to finally name her diamond.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.708
Or perhaps this author

43:05.791 --> 43:08.669
should take matters into her own hands.

43:08.752 --> 43:11.213
I shall not be hustled
into making my selection.

43:11.297 --> 43:12.339
Not by anyone.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.716
Of course, Your Majesty.

43:13.799 --> 43:14.967
Take this away.

43:15.050 --> 43:17.428
And bring me a list of the peerage.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.813
Some tea, my lord?

43:27.896 --> 43:29.898
Perhaps some warm milk may be better.

43:30.482 --> 43:31.984
Oh! Are those marbles?

43:32.651 --> 43:33.736
What fun!

43:35.029 --> 43:36.447
Might I go and read now?

43:37.531 --> 43:40.826
[Lady Whistledown] Though,
of the many purportedly well-trained

43:40.909 --> 43:44.288
and bred hothouse flowers
on display this year,

43:44.913 --> 43:47.416
this author must wonder

43:47.499 --> 43:51.712
if a more surprising choice
might still be in store.

43:53.422 --> 43:56.133
The younger one would do,
if the eldest just got out of the way.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.843
[man 2] The sister is dreadful.

44:02.890 --> 44:03.891
[dog barks]

44:03.974 --> 44:05.643
[Lady Danbury] Not on my chair!

44:05.726 --> 44:07.019
[dog whimpers]

44:09.480 --> 44:10.397
[sighs]

44:12.232 --> 44:16.487
[Lady Whistledown] Whichever darling miss
receives such high esteem,

44:16.570 --> 44:21.784
let us hope there is a suitor available
of only the sharpest wit,

44:21.867 --> 44:27.373
lest his dry musings leave
a young lady wilting like a parched rose.

44:27.456 --> 44:28.415
[snorting chuckle]

44:28.499 --> 44:31.543
It is rather clever
the way she uses plant puns to belittle.

44:31.627 --> 44:32.711
[laughter]

44:32.795 --> 44:34.129
Clever indeed!

44:35.047 --> 44:37.132
The candlesticks, see what they're worth.

44:38.008 --> 44:39.176
[Varley] Yes, ma'am.

44:43.430 --> 44:46.475
-[classical piano tune playing]
-[Violet chuckles] There. You see?

44:48.602 --> 44:49.978
Lady Goring was quite taken

44:50.062 --> 44:52.481
with Eloise's dress last night,
Madame Delacroix.

44:52.564 --> 44:56.193
She would keep saying how well
it complemented her complexion.

44:56.985 --> 44:59.029
She said you reminded her
of Daphne, dearest.

44:59.113 --> 45:01.115
I am not Daphne.

45:02.074 --> 45:03.742
-This is the one.
-Ah.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.786
With pleasure, Lady Bridgerton.

45:05.869 --> 45:06.787
[clears throat]

45:10.124 --> 45:13.210
You do know, Eloise,
that you might enjoy the next ball

45:13.293 --> 45:14.962
if you, in fact, danced with someone.

45:15.838 --> 45:18.298
Meeting new people, it can be thrilling.

45:18.382 --> 45:21.468
Yes, it certainly seemed
as though Anthony had a thrilling time.

45:21.552 --> 45:24.054
Swept away by many
a nimble-footed young lady, Brother?

45:24.138 --> 45:26.223
I can still barely feel my toes.

45:26.306 --> 45:28.392
I thought you ladies were taught to dance.

45:28.475 --> 45:31.186
I thought you gentlemen
capable of worthwhile conversation.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.188
How sad both of our hopes were dashed.

45:35.941 --> 45:38.402
I think Eloise
would make a brilliant diamond.

45:38.485 --> 45:40.529
I could not agree more, Hyacinth.

45:40.612 --> 45:43.574
Perhaps Her Majesty will take note
at her ball tomorrow night.

45:44.074 --> 45:46.034
-I despise you.
-[chuckling]

45:49.246 --> 45:50.247
Madame Delacroix.

45:50.914 --> 45:52.624
I didn't know you were back in town.

45:52.708 --> 45:53.834
Bien sûr!

45:53.917 --> 45:56.962
Who else could dress
these delicate debutantes for the season?

45:57.045 --> 45:57.963
[Benedict chuckles]

45:59.047 --> 46:01.300
Does that mean
I shall see you later on tonight?

46:02.050 --> 46:03.802
I hear there's a party.

46:05.262 --> 46:08.432
I have much work to do, Mr. Bridgerton,

46:09.057 --> 46:12.269
and my art must come before all else.

46:13.437 --> 46:14.938
Enjoy your time.

46:19.693 --> 46:20.527
Brother.

46:26.074 --> 46:29.870
Are you and the modiste
still, uh, making a stitch?

46:29.953 --> 46:31.830
Apparently not. Have you found a wife yet?

46:31.914 --> 46:34.666
Or are you planning to offend
every girl until there are none left?

46:34.750 --> 46:35.626
Is Mother aware?

46:35.709 --> 46:38.295
-Aware of what?
-I'm off to deal with our solicitor.

46:39.254 --> 46:41.131
Have fun
with your pretty pictures, Brother.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.804
-[Violet] Anthony?
-[door closes]

46:48.722 --> 46:53.018
There were some lovely young ladies
in attendance last night, were there not?

46:53.602 --> 46:55.771
Lady Delilah has beautiful manners,

46:55.854 --> 46:59.566
and I hear Miss Goodrum
is very accomplished in her needlework.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.485
Perhaps you shall
get to know them better soon.

47:01.568 --> 47:03.737
Lady Delilah can barely
string a sentence together,

47:03.821 --> 47:07.115
and Miss Goodrum thought
that Napoleon fights for the Spanish.

47:07.616 --> 47:09.785
As for every other eager chit
you pushed in my direction,

47:09.868 --> 47:11.453
I'd happily never lay eyes on them again.

47:11.537 --> 47:13.372
-Anthony--
-I am looking for perfection, Mother.

47:13.455 --> 47:14.623
And you should be too.

47:14.706 --> 47:17.709
The woman I marry
shall be the Viscountess Bridgerton.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.504
The lady of this household,
responsible for launching my sisters

47:20.587 --> 47:21.797
and bearing my children.

47:22.464 --> 47:24.174
Do you desire them to be raised by a woman

47:24.258 --> 47:27.010
who does not know how to so much
as hold a map right side up?

47:28.470 --> 47:30.347
This is the duty I must fulfill.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.310
You will end up alone

47:36.228 --> 47:38.063
with such expectations.

47:43.402 --> 47:44.403
Good day, Mother.

47:53.620 --> 47:57.082

48:03.213 --> 48:04.464
[knock at door]

48:07.801 --> 48:09.803
Why is it so quiet in here?

48:10.345 --> 48:11.638
Because I am alone?

48:12.264 --> 48:13.724
Reading, as I always do.

48:14.224 --> 48:16.935
[sighs deeply] You are so boring.

48:17.561 --> 48:22.649
I will be perfectly putrefied
if Philippa does manage to marry Finch.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.153
"Petrified." The word is "petrified."

48:29.239 --> 48:30.115
What is that?

48:30.198 --> 48:31.283
What is what?

48:31.783 --> 48:33.702
-What you are writing.
-I am not writing.

48:33.785 --> 48:34.661
But you were.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.788
Prudence. Do not-- Hand it back!

48:36.872 --> 48:39.207
Why, you little devil-doll!

48:39.291 --> 48:41.710
This is what occupies your "quiet" time?

48:41.793 --> 48:44.254
What are you ladies doing, still up?

48:45.005 --> 48:46.048
Penelope was writing…

48:47.758 --> 48:49.301
to Colin Bridgerton.

48:50.218 --> 48:52.638
Well, that would explain
the ink all over her fingers.

48:52.721 --> 48:54.139
I declare, Penelope.

48:54.222 --> 48:55.891
-Colin is my friend!
-[giggles]

48:55.974 --> 48:59.227
As if he would ever waste his ink
on someone like you.

48:59.311 --> 49:01.063
-Are these worth anything?
-What?

49:01.688 --> 49:04.691
Your books. Books can be
worth something, can they not?

49:04.775 --> 49:06.068
I do not think so, Mama.

49:06.151 --> 49:07.444
Oh, pity.

49:09.655 --> 49:11.365
You must stop wasting your precious time

49:11.448 --> 49:14.284
on such pointless pursuits
as writing silly letters.

49:15.077 --> 49:19.873
Colin Bridgerton is no more your friend
than I am the next Catherine the Great.

49:21.083 --> 49:24.378
Now, wipe your hands,
lest someone should think you a commoner.

49:30.676 --> 49:31.802
[door closes]

49:36.139 --> 49:37.182
[sighs]

49:43.480 --> 49:44.481
Ma'am.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.316
A letter for you.

49:49.987 --> 49:51.029
[door opens]

49:58.787 --> 50:01.164
Your tea grows cold.

50:01.748 --> 50:03.917
My horses do not.

50:04.418 --> 50:07.587
Did you plan
to ride again tomorrow morning?

50:10.966 --> 50:13.635
I know all that goes on in my home.

50:14.344 --> 50:17.097
And since you insist on sneaking around,

50:17.639 --> 50:19.933
I may as well save us both the trouble.

50:20.434 --> 50:23.812
Correspondence from your grandparents,
the Sheffields.

50:23.895 --> 50:25.397
I wrote to them before you arrived.

50:25.480 --> 50:28.150
Those people are not my grandparents,
Lady Danbury.

50:28.233 --> 50:30.485
I have no relation
to them whatsoever, in fact.

50:31.528 --> 50:35.741
It seems you have not been
straightforward with me.

50:35.824 --> 50:39.369
I realize I should not have gone out
for a morning ride without a chaperone.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.455
And what about failing to tell me

50:41.538 --> 50:44.374
why you have truly
come to London with your sister?

50:45.042 --> 50:47.127
I'm rather more concerned about that.

50:49.421 --> 50:51.465
We have come to find Edwina a husband.

50:52.382 --> 50:53.884
And is that all?

50:54.551 --> 50:56.595
You would be wise to reconsider

50:56.678 --> 50:59.639
resorting to more forgeries
and half-truths, Miss Sharma.

51:00.557 --> 51:05.145
Very few attempt to outwit me,
and even fewer succeed.

51:05.896 --> 51:09.775
You are living under my roof,
under my care,

51:09.858 --> 51:13.195
relying on my good name,
my connections, my money.

51:13.695 --> 51:17.657
I vouched for you and your sister
in front of Her Majesty the Queen,

51:17.741 --> 51:18.950
all because

51:20.035 --> 51:24.372
I thought I was paying
a kindness to an old friend--

51:24.456 --> 51:27.501
And we are truly grateful for everything.

51:28.627 --> 51:32.297
Your mama misses your father, naturally.

51:32.798 --> 51:35.842
But she never really wanted
to come back here, did she?

51:35.926 --> 51:36.968
You did!

51:38.512 --> 51:41.723
I have no interest in being used
as a pawn in someone else's game.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.266
That is not what we are doing.

51:43.350 --> 51:46.978
Then tell me what stipulations
the Sheffields have apparently set down

51:47.062 --> 51:49.022
with regard to Edwina's match.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.817
Stipulations which,
if met, will, I am guessing,

51:51.900 --> 51:55.529
guarantee great fortune
for you and your family.

51:58.907 --> 52:01.701
Edwina must marry
an Englishman of nobility.

52:07.415 --> 52:10.961
They could not control
your mama's marriage,

52:11.044 --> 52:13.964
so they mean
to interfere with your sister's.

52:14.047 --> 52:14.923
[Kate] Yes.

52:15.006 --> 52:18.552
They never recovered
from my father's lack of rank and title.

52:19.261 --> 52:23.140
Though let me assure you, Lady Danbury,
I am not here for selfish reasons.

52:24.224 --> 52:27.894
After my father died,
Mama and I did the best we could

52:27.978 --> 52:31.731
to raise Edwina, all so she would
never know of our struggles.

52:32.899 --> 52:36.153
But our money ran low.
We used the last for this very journey.

52:36.236 --> 52:39.823
The Sheffields have agreed
to bestow a sizable dowry on my sister,

52:39.906 --> 52:41.575
and to look after my mama.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.536
But only if Edwina marries properly.

52:52.085 --> 52:53.503
And what about you?

52:54.629 --> 52:57.674
If I could marry
for the sake of my family, I would.

52:57.757 --> 53:01.261
But I am not
my mama's daughter by birth. Edwina is.

53:01.344 --> 53:02.304
[softly] Oh.

53:03.555 --> 53:05.682
I've spent the last eight years

53:05.765 --> 53:08.351
raising my sister
to walk in the right way,

53:08.435 --> 53:11.479
to talk in the right way,
to play the pianoforte just so.

53:15.525 --> 53:19.446
Teaching her twice as much and watching
her work twice as hard as anyone else.

53:19.529 --> 53:22.949
I even taught her how to make this pitiful
excuse for tea the English so adore.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.576
I despise English tea.

53:24.659 --> 53:25.619
[laughs]

53:26.328 --> 53:29.581
But if it means my sister
will not be left destitute,

53:30.707 --> 53:32.876
then I will smile, and I will nod politely

53:32.959 --> 53:35.337
after each and every sip, to be sure.

53:36.338 --> 53:37.923
[breathes deeply]

53:38.506 --> 53:40.884
Your sister has a right to know.

53:40.967 --> 53:43.929
As you said, it is her future.

53:45.680 --> 53:49.476
That is precisely why I shield her.
Because I know her.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.686
If she was made aware
of the circumstances,

53:51.770 --> 53:54.022
she would marry quickly only to please us.

53:54.105 --> 53:56.650
She would say yes
to any man kind enough to ask.

53:57.734 --> 54:01.988
Edwina deserves a chance
to find love without such a burden.

54:03.865 --> 54:05.784
Please, you must not tell a soul.

54:07.410 --> 54:08.453
[Lady Danbury] Mmm.

54:11.873 --> 54:15.877
[Lady Whistledown]
Formed under pressure, desired by many,

54:15.961 --> 54:19.297
yet possessed only by a fortunate few,

54:19.381 --> 54:23.218
there is nothing on earth quite so envied

54:23.301 --> 54:24.928
as a diamond.

54:34.562 --> 54:36.773
Might our queen finally

54:36.856 --> 54:39.025
extinguish the fevered speculation

54:39.109 --> 54:41.861
and bestow the highest of honors

54:41.945 --> 54:44.864
to a most fortunate young lady tonight?

54:48.827 --> 54:52.205
With so many futures at risk,

54:52.289 --> 54:55.667
I do suspect this author
is not the only one

54:55.750 --> 54:58.086
waiting with bated breath.

55:00.255 --> 55:04.509
I do hope you are finding
everything in town to your satisfaction,

55:05.218 --> 55:06.219
Lady Mary.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.013
Indeed I am, Your Majesty.

55:08.096 --> 55:10.223
This time around, that is.

55:10.807 --> 55:15.603
Perhaps your mother would enjoy
some refreshment, Miss Sharma.

55:23.570 --> 55:27.615
I might think Lady Mary
deserves some recognition, ma'am.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.993
It's certainly a sign
of true devotion on her part,

55:30.076 --> 55:32.037
having sought to introduce her daughters

55:32.120 --> 55:34.956
under the discerning eye
of Your Majesty, after all.

55:35.457 --> 55:38.084
The youngest one, in particular, I think,

55:38.168 --> 55:42.255
will certainly make a match
that will be the envy of the ton.

55:42.839 --> 55:46.593
Why do I sense my strings
being pulled, Lady Danbury?

55:46.676 --> 55:49.220
You said you wanted
to shake up the season.

55:50.305 --> 55:51.931
Now is your chance.

55:57.479 --> 55:58.813
[Eloise groans]

55:59.356 --> 56:01.691
Anyone here you've not yet rejected?

56:01.775 --> 56:04.736
You're the artist.
Do you see anyone remotely inspiring?

56:05.737 --> 56:08.490
We shall have our diamond tonight,
and I shall have a wife.

56:11.242 --> 56:13.495
Lady Bridgerton. Miss Bridgerton.

56:13.995 --> 56:17.624
Such a shame your presentation
at court was so rudely interrupted.

56:17.707 --> 56:18.708
Shame, indeed.

56:18.792 --> 56:22.170
[Queen Charlotte] I nearly forgot
you were making your debut this season.

56:22.253 --> 56:24.714
After your elder sister's triumph,

56:25.298 --> 56:28.134
perhaps good fortune
might run in the family.

56:28.218 --> 56:29.636
[laughter]

56:31.971 --> 56:34.891
Uh, it is a delightful ball, Your Majesty.

56:34.974 --> 56:36.726
Very diamond-y. [chuckles]

56:36.810 --> 56:39.771
Though, I must admit,
I am more of an emerald person myself.

56:41.606 --> 56:42.607
[clears throat]

56:43.274 --> 56:45.610
[laughing heartily]

56:46.778 --> 56:47.612
Oh, dear!

56:49.447 --> 56:51.658
My favorite necklace is one of emeralds.

56:51.741 --> 56:54.160
-How thoughtful of you to know that.
-Oh. [chuckles]

56:54.244 --> 56:55.662
It seems you have indeed

56:55.745 --> 56:59.082
come a long way
since last year, Miss Bridgerton.

56:59.791 --> 57:00.792
[hesitant chuckle]

57:05.922 --> 57:07.132
[softly] Excuse me.

57:10.802 --> 57:14.264
If the queen, in fact,
names Eloise the diamond,

57:14.347 --> 57:16.057
whom will you marry then, Brother?

57:16.141 --> 57:17.267
Hush, you.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.979
[classical dance tune playing]

57:28.194 --> 57:30.071
[breathing heavily]

57:32.449 --> 57:33.283
Pen!

57:33.366 --> 57:34.659
Pen! Pen, Pen. Pen.

57:34.742 --> 57:35.827
We must leave.

57:35.910 --> 57:38.997
The queen, she--
I somehow managed to charm her.

57:39.831 --> 57:43.126
-She seems to, in fact, like me. I don't--
-Eloise, you must calm down.

57:43.209 --> 57:44.377
Eloise Bridgerton.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.379
[chuckles] The diamond.

57:47.088 --> 57:50.550
Perhaps now you might stop spending time
with insipid wallflowers all evening

57:51.134 --> 57:52.802
and refine your circle of friends.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.762
-[Penelope sighs]
-I may have an opening--

57:54.846 --> 57:56.347
-I would rather die.
-[gasps]

57:58.516 --> 57:59.642
[stifling laughter]

58:04.063 --> 58:04.939
[sighs]

58:05.023 --> 58:07.817
[Eloise] How you managed
an entire season of these absurd events

58:07.901 --> 58:10.612
alongside people like
Cressida Cowper is beyond me.

58:10.695 --> 58:12.447
And it's not just her. It is all of them.

58:12.530 --> 58:15.492
Staring at me as if I were
some fine china teapot.

58:15.575 --> 58:17.285
How did you do it on your own, Pen?

58:17.368 --> 58:19.204
I do not share your difficulties, El.

58:19.287 --> 58:21.873
-"Insipid wallflower," remember?
-Ugh. That is not--

58:21.956 --> 58:23.666
Cressida is incensed
that even her new dress

58:23.750 --> 58:24.751
cannot hide her character.

58:24.834 --> 58:25.919
[chuckles]

58:26.920 --> 58:28.213
[Eloise sighs]

58:31.841 --> 58:33.218
It's not that bad, you know.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.595
-The wallflower thing.
-Mmm.

58:36.262 --> 58:38.640
I always get the first glass of lemonade.

58:38.723 --> 58:41.017
I know who all the best dancers
are just from watching.

58:41.684 --> 58:43.436
I can always tell when a suitor is serious

58:43.520 --> 58:46.773
about courtship just by how he looks
when a young lady dances with another.

58:46.856 --> 58:50.568
The wall even affords me the chance
to hear what the footmen say in secret.

58:51.861 --> 58:53.863
You've been keeping it from me.

58:56.449 --> 58:59.118
You do not have
to pretend any longer, Pen.

59:00.828 --> 59:02.956
-You like all of this.
-[chuckles]

59:04.999 --> 59:07.043
-Well, it can be amusing.
-[chuckles]

59:09.087 --> 59:10.922
I know you have begun
to think little of her,

59:11.005 --> 59:13.299
but is Lady Whistledown
still not a source of amusement?

59:13.383 --> 59:15.134
It's not that I think little of her.

59:16.094 --> 59:17.845
When she was gone,
I thought I would miss her.

59:17.929 --> 59:20.557
I thought I needed her
to make sense of this world. But…

59:21.057 --> 59:24.602
now she is back,
reporting on the same old things.

59:24.686 --> 59:26.688
Just another reminder of how trapped I am.

59:30.316 --> 59:31.985
I can feel people's eyes on me.

59:32.068 --> 59:35.405
Every time I walk into a ballroom,
I know they are comparing me to Daphne.

59:35.488 --> 59:40.076
She was so good at being the diamond
and it made my mother so happy.

59:41.327 --> 59:42.745
I can never live up to that.

59:43.329 --> 59:46.291
I do not want to live up to that,
but it does not make it any easier to know

59:46.374 --> 59:49.752
you are constantly disappointing people
just by walking into a room.

59:51.337 --> 59:52.922
I never thought of it that way.

59:54.632 --> 59:57.176
No one truly notices me.

59:58.970 --> 1:00:00.346
I suppose that is what I like.

1:00:01.848 --> 1:00:04.100
When you're invisible, you have
all the amusement you want

1:00:04.183 --> 1:00:07.061
without any of
the expectations popularity brings.

1:00:07.145 --> 1:00:08.688
It frees you.

1:00:10.815 --> 1:00:13.401
Do you think that is why
Whistledown remains anonymous?

1:00:14.485 --> 1:00:15.403
Perhaps.

1:00:17.030 --> 1:00:19.157
Do you think that is why
Cressida is so cruel?

1:00:19.866 --> 1:00:20.700
No.

1:00:21.492 --> 1:00:23.911
I think she just wears her hair too tight.

1:00:23.995 --> 1:00:25.997
[both laughing]

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:32.128
[Eloise] Oh.

1:00:32.211 --> 1:00:34.297
[playing fanfare]

1:00:38.593 --> 1:00:39.969
[hushed chatter]

1:00:40.053 --> 1:00:42.472
Your presence is noted,

1:00:42.555 --> 1:00:44.932
and your queen most appreciative.

1:00:46.225 --> 1:00:51.648
Allow it to now be my honor
to present to you the season's diamond.

1:01:02.909 --> 1:01:04.577
Miss Edwina Sharma.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.663
[attendees gasping, muttering]

1:01:08.373 --> 1:01:10.333
[classical music playing]

1:01:21.135 --> 1:01:24.013
You look at her the way I look
at a finished painting, Brother.

1:01:24.097 --> 1:01:25.932
Every man needs a muse, does he not?

1:01:40.738 --> 1:01:42.281
Viscount Bridgerton.

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:45.618
Have you yet met my new incomparable?

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:49.414
I am most grateful
for the introduction, Your Majesty.

1:01:49.497 --> 1:01:52.250
I only hope I shall be afforded
the pleasure of a dance.

1:02:02.885 --> 1:02:04.762
I suppose I should thank you.

1:02:04.846 --> 1:02:05.722
[chuckles softly]

1:02:05.805 --> 1:02:09.100
Oh, child. It is much too soon for that.

1:02:10.143 --> 1:02:13.229
You must know the real work begins now.

1:02:13.312 --> 1:02:15.606
Indeed. There will be
a mire to wade through

1:02:15.690 --> 1:02:17.442
on behalf of my sister, to be sure.

1:02:17.525 --> 1:02:19.402
Speaking of, where is my sister?

1:02:21.821 --> 1:02:24.949
Forgive my directness.
Do you have any thoughts about children?

1:02:25.450 --> 1:02:27.577
Other than the fact that I desire them so?

1:02:28.453 --> 1:02:31.748
However many I have, my lord,
I shall feel most fortunate.

1:02:31.831 --> 1:02:34.667
Together with my husband,
we will chart the best course.

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:36.419
How very sensible.

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:39.964
Do you play
any musical instruments, by chance?

1:02:40.047 --> 1:02:41.299
[chuckles lightly]

1:02:41.382 --> 1:02:42.967
Many, in fact.

1:02:43.050 --> 1:02:47.388
But, for the most part, my education
was taken up by more serious pursuits.

1:02:49.056 --> 1:02:51.893
Modern languages, classical literature.

1:02:51.976 --> 1:02:53.436
I do love to read.

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:59.484
You do not seem discomposed
by my line of questioning.

1:03:00.318 --> 1:03:01.527
Why ever would I be?

1:03:01.611 --> 1:03:05.239
A man who knows
what he wants is most admirable.

1:03:06.866 --> 1:03:09.452
Is your father in attendance?
I should like to speak with him.

1:03:10.578 --> 1:03:12.872
Sadly, my father died years ago.

1:03:13.748 --> 1:03:14.707
Ah.

1:03:15.792 --> 1:03:16.876
I'm so sorry.

1:03:19.128 --> 1:03:20.004
As did mine.

1:03:22.507 --> 1:03:23.508
[song ends]

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:29.889
Though, perhaps
you could speak with my sister.

1:03:30.473 --> 1:03:32.850
It is her blessing
you shall need if we are…

1:03:32.934 --> 1:03:34.143
Oh! Here she is now.

1:03:34.227 --> 1:03:35.978
-Kate!
-[Lady Danbury] Ah, Lord Bridgerton.

1:03:36.062 --> 1:03:38.731
I see you've met Miss Edwina. This is--

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:39.774
Her sister.

1:03:39.857 --> 1:03:41.317
-Miss Sharma, my lord.
-Oh.

1:03:43.778 --> 1:03:46.364
The Viscount Bridgerton
is a most excellent dancer.

1:03:46.447 --> 1:03:48.991
Perhaps I may learn
a thing or two from you, my lord.

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:51.494
Would you join me
in the retiring room, Sister?

1:03:53.913 --> 1:03:55.206
Is something wrong, Didi?

1:03:55.289 --> 1:03:58.042
You are not to go near that man.
Do you understand?

1:04:00.253 --> 1:04:02.547
She is a lovely diamond, dearest.

1:04:02.630 --> 1:04:03.589
Indeed.

1:04:05.091 --> 1:04:06.592
She is who I shall marry.

1:04:07.593 --> 1:04:10.304
There are a few things
I must make you aware of.

1:04:10.388 --> 1:04:14.308
[Lady Whistledown]
Color, clarity, carat, cut.

1:04:14.392 --> 1:04:18.896
At long last, the queen
has named her most precious stone.

1:04:22.358 --> 1:04:24.235
What is all this?

1:04:25.152 --> 1:04:26.320
[Varley sighs]

1:04:26.821 --> 1:04:27.655
Ma'am.

1:04:28.281 --> 1:04:29.448
He is here.

1:04:30.032 --> 1:04:31.826
The new Lord Featherington.

1:04:31.909 --> 1:04:33.828
[footsteps descending]

1:04:35.162 --> 1:04:36.789
Lady Featherington.

1:04:37.957 --> 1:04:40.251
That still work if we are not married?

1:04:40.334 --> 1:04:41.627
It's rather strange.

1:04:42.545 --> 1:04:44.755
I thought the heir was old.

1:04:44.839 --> 1:04:46.924
-I thought the heir was ugly.
-Ladies.

1:04:47.008 --> 1:04:49.510
It is quite all right.
You must mean my father.

1:04:49.594 --> 1:04:51.512
And no offense taken. He was ugly.

1:04:51.596 --> 1:04:52.805
And very old.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:55.975
So old that, well, he died.

1:04:56.976 --> 1:05:00.646
I'm terribly sorry for my late arrival.
I made the trip from America.

1:05:00.730 --> 1:05:02.899
But don't worry,
I've started taking care of things.

1:05:02.982 --> 1:05:05.276
Philippa. That must be you.

1:05:05.359 --> 1:05:07.361
Your dowry
to that fine Finch fellow is paid.

1:05:07.445 --> 1:05:09.322
The late Lord's books
are on their way to me now.

1:05:09.405 --> 1:05:11.866
And I even took the liberty
of having your possessions

1:05:11.949 --> 1:05:13.868
moved from your bedchamber,
Lady Featherington.

1:05:13.951 --> 1:05:15.703
[chuckling] Yes, it's still strange.

1:05:15.786 --> 1:05:17.705
You had my possessions moved?

1:05:17.788 --> 1:05:21.083
Well, I shall be taking over those rooms,
now that the home is mine.

1:05:21.167 --> 1:05:22.376
You understand, yes?

1:05:23.878 --> 1:05:25.379
[Penelope] It is like you said, Mama.

1:05:25.463 --> 1:05:27.590
The new Lord Featherington
is here to provide.

1:05:31.302 --> 1:05:34.430
[Lady Whistledown]
While this author finds Miss Edwina Sharma

1:05:34.513 --> 1:05:37.016
to be an exceptional young lady,

1:05:37.099 --> 1:05:40.269
it is about time I used these pages

1:05:40.353 --> 1:05:42.355
of record for something else.

1:05:42.438 --> 1:05:43.898
A shift.

1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:48.235
Is the entire practice
of naming a diamond not…

1:05:48.319 --> 1:05:50.738
well, rather ridiculous?

1:05:50.821 --> 1:05:55.451
Should a woman not be valued
for so much more than her dancing skills

1:05:55.534 --> 1:05:57.119
or her comportment?

1:05:57.203 --> 1:05:59.914
Should we not value a woman instead

1:05:59.997 --> 1:06:02.458
for her candor, her character,

1:06:02.541 --> 1:06:04.377
her true accomplishments?

1:06:04.460 --> 1:06:05.878
What do you think, Eloise?

1:06:06.545 --> 1:06:08.339
-I love it.
-[chuckles]

1:06:09.799 --> 1:06:15.262
Perhaps if the queen abandoned
this absurdity that is the diamond,

1:06:15.346 --> 1:06:19.225
we would all see
that a woman can be so much more.

1:06:20.935 --> 1:06:22.603
What is it, Your Majesty?

1:06:22.687 --> 1:06:24.021
Edwina Sharma.

1:06:24.730 --> 1:06:25.940
My diamond.

1:06:26.565 --> 1:06:31.195
It seems she will need to do more
for me this season than simply sparkle.
