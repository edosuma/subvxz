00:16.451 --> 00:20.410
This is a staff meeting, Mr Shore.

00:20.722 --> 00:21.915
I realize that.

00:21.915 --> 00:25.000
–Why are you in a Santa suit?
–It's after Thanksgiving.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.030
Surely you're not suggesting
I still dress as a pilgrim.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.325
And who is this?

00:29.325 --> 00:30.878
She's my elf.

00:30.878 --> 00:34.498
Sometimes, especially 
after Santa's been drinking,

00:34.498 --> 00:36.627
he needs a little helper.

00:36.627 --> 00:38.675
Have you been drinking today?

00:38.675 --> 00:41.687
No. Today, I just brought 
her for amusement.

00:41.687 --> 00:44.582
My doctors are concerned
these staff meetings

00:44.582 --> 00:48.139
could cause me to lapse into a coma.

00:48.139 --> 00:49.374
I see.

00:49.374 --> 00:53.874
Well, since privileged information is
exchanged during these staff meetings,

00:53.874 --> 00:56.780
your helper will have to leave.

00:58.332 --> 01:00.600
Would you wait in my office, dear?

01:00.600 --> 01:01.717
Sure.

01:16.824 --> 01:19.237
Actually, there is that walk-in.

01:19.237 --> 01:22.537
He's waiting in reception.
Maybe Alan should take that.

01:23.365 --> 01:24.623
Perhaps you're right.

01:24.623 --> 01:27.634
A wrongful termination, a guy was
fired as a department store Santa.

01:27.634 --> 01:29.464
I mean, since you seem to have such

01:29.464 --> 01:33.780
a connection with the
subject matter. —I'll do it.

01:34.807 --> 01:37.105
I've always wanted a Santa case.

01:37.105 --> 01:39.170
Oh, this is much more right for Alan.

01:39.170 --> 01:40.786
I said I'll do it.

01:42.158 --> 01:43.183
Where is he?

01:43.183 --> 01:44.941
Uh, in reception.

01:51.492 --> 01:52.976
Gil Furnald?

01:54.292 --> 01:55.551
That's me.

02:03.021 --> 02:04.445
No, it isn't. —Yes, it is.

02:04.445 --> 02:05.663
No, it isn't.

02:06.749 --> 02:08.479
Ho ho ho.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.389
Deal with it.

02:11.785 --> 02:14.043
Alan. —Tara.

02:14.043 --> 02:15.348
What's with the woman?

02:15.348 --> 02:16.459
What woman?

02:16.459 --> 02:19.372
What woman? The one you
brought to the staff meeting.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.881
She's my elf, Tara. 
I thought I was quite clear on that.

02:21.881 --> 02:24.047
Yes, very amusing.
Why is she here?

02:24.047 --> 02:27.017
Well, it seems I've put on
a few pounds since last year.

02:27.017 --> 02:28.518
So she brought me my new suit.

02:28.518 --> 02:30.265
I do some work with the salvation army.

02:30.265 --> 02:32.685
We work as a team, actually.

02:33.173 --> 02:34.745
Is there a problem?

02:35.017 --> 02:37.271
Not at all. —But…

02:37.271 --> 02:38.983
not that I've been doing
background checks,

02:38.983 --> 02:44.165
but I have a friend who evidently 
knows an old friend of yours, and…

02:44.165 --> 02:45.245
And?

02:45.245 --> 02:50.221
You once cohabited with a little person.

02:50.221 --> 02:51.752
Two lovely years.

02:51.752 --> 02:53.370
I lived with her for three.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.357
Do you have a thing…

02:55.357 --> 02:57.332
for little women?

02:58.537 --> 03:01.588
I have a thing for women.

03:01.588 --> 03:03.795
You've never fallen for someone 
shorter than you?

03:03.795 --> 03:06.375
Well, I believe I'm involved 
with one now.

03:12.411 --> 03:15.800
Either you're mistaken, 
or I'm jealous.

03:50.093 --> 03:54.773
It's just very difficult to reconcile
being drawn to a person I consider…

03:54.773 --> 03:57.860
well, repugnant.

03:57.860 --> 04:00.747
What, you think you're the first 
good girl to fall for a bad boy?

04:00.747 --> 04:03.041
Is my problem annoying you?

04:04.714 --> 04:06.996
No. I'm sorry. I…

04:07.484 --> 04:08.922
I just meant to convey

04:08.922 --> 04:12.685
it's very common for women to be
attracted to men they don't admire.

04:12.685 --> 04:13.625
What could be at play here,

04:13.625 --> 04:15.515
there are qualities in yourself
you don't like,

04:15.515 --> 04:17.930
or qualities about Alan Shore
you wish you had. —That isn't it.

04:17.930 --> 04:20.208
I like myself just fine.

04:23.339 --> 04:24.966
I saw that.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.173
Uh…

04:27.993 --> 04:31.854
Look, this is not a great day for me.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.885
Perhaps we should reschedule?

04:33.885 --> 04:35.089
Okay.

04:38.227 --> 04:39.629
Is everything okay?

04:39.629 --> 04:40.868
Yeah.

04:44.099 --> 04:48.231
Could I speak to you as a lawyer?

04:48.231 --> 04:50.100
Uh, sure.

04:50.442 --> 04:54.794
But you're gonna have to face
the little clock towards me.

04:54.945 --> 04:58.076
This is all privileged, right?
Lawyer, client?

04:58.512 --> 04:59.663
Of course.

04:59.940 --> 05:04.938
Look, I, I have a patient who's been
with me for almost four years now.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.485
And he, um,

05:07.053 --> 05:09.649
he habitually speaks of fantasies,

05:09.649 --> 05:12.011
things he plans to do.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.781
They're typically idle ruminations,

05:13.781 --> 05:16.072
I suppose, to make him feel better.

05:16.979 --> 05:21.111
Lately, he's been talking about
murdering his ex-wife.

05:21.111 --> 05:23.543
And at first, I thought, 
harmless chatter again.

05:23.543 --> 05:26.650
But there seems to be such a resolve.

05:26.650 --> 05:28.540
Lori, I can't be sure that it 
isn't real this time.

05:28.540 --> 05:31.453
This man may very well be
planning to kill his ex-wife,

05:31.453 --> 05:33.690
and I'm just not sure what to do.

05:46.326 --> 05:50.602
I just like wearing
women's clothes sometimes.

05:50.602 --> 05:52.788
It's not a sexual turn-on.

05:52.788 --> 05:55.317
Well, it just feels right sometimes.

05:55.317 --> 05:57.785
So, basically, you're a sicko.

05:57.785 --> 05:59.146
I'm not sick.

05:59.146 --> 06:00.866
Lighten, my man.

06:01.886 --> 06:05.219
So, what, you got caught
in a skirt, and that was it?

06:05.219 --> 06:08.372
My employer found out,
and, yes, I got fired.

06:08.372 --> 06:09.934
They asked me a lot of questions,

06:09.934 --> 06:12.400
like whether I'm gay.

06:12.899 --> 06:14.249
Are you?

06:14.674 --> 06:16.820
Not that there's anything 
wrong with it.

06:16.820 --> 06:20.707
Yes. But that does not
make me an unfit Santa.

06:20.707 --> 06:21.849
Criminal record? —No.

06:21.849 --> 06:22.689
No, no, no, no, no.

06:22.689 --> 06:24.616
And there's never been any incident.

06:24.616 --> 06:27.549
I have been a good Santa
for eight years.

06:27.549 --> 06:29.811
A great Santa.

06:29.811 --> 06:31.599
I can show you the letters.

06:31.599 --> 06:36.351
There are kids and families who have
specifically come back for me.

06:36.351 --> 06:38.818
And I thought, this is wrong.

06:38.818 --> 06:42.986
I should not lose my job
because of how I like to dress.

06:53.573 --> 06:54.934
Does he know you taped him?

06:54.934 --> 06:58.488
No, I'm just full
of ethical violations.

07:02.317 --> 07:05.135
It's important that I do 
it with my hands.

07:05.135 --> 07:07.948
I don't know why.
You could probably tell me why.

07:07.948 --> 07:09.993
But, see, the thing is,

07:10.246 --> 07:11.848
I don't want to shoot her

07:11.848 --> 07:13.665
or, uh, poison her

07:13.665 --> 07:15.223
or hit her with a car.

07:15.223 --> 07:18.376
No. It needs to be
by strangulation.

07:18.376 --> 07:20.593
Do you have any guess as to why?

07:20.593 --> 07:21.899
Well, for one,

07:21.899 --> 07:25.006
I actually want to feel
the life going out of her,

07:25.006 --> 07:26.531
I mean, with my hands.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.930
I want to feel her body go limp.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.667
Also, I want her to experience it.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.692
I want her to know that she's dying,

07:34.692 --> 07:37.558
and I want to see her eyes
as I do it.

07:39.782 --> 07:42.030
And how do you know
that this isn't just talk?

07:42.030 --> 07:44.207
I keep telling you, I don't know.

07:44.207 --> 07:45.701
I mean, he's often fantasized.

07:45.701 --> 07:47.774
Last year, he spoke
of blowing up his boss.

07:47.774 --> 07:50.053
But his demeanor here, as I said,

07:50.053 --> 07:53.198
there's a certain resolve
that really concerns me.

07:53.198 --> 07:55.312
Have you shown this to any 
other therapists or…

07:55.312 --> 07:57.902
No, no, no, I am the only one
who can make that call.

07:57.902 --> 08:01.460
And your call is it's possible
he's going to do it.

08:02.353 --> 08:04.869
Do I tell the ex-wife?

08:04.869 --> 08:07.689
Well, I'm sure you know the law
on this as well as I do.

08:07.689 --> 08:09.424
I mean, you have a duty
to warn the victim

08:09.424 --> 08:11.852
if you're reasonably certain
she's in physical danger.

08:11.852 --> 08:13.736
But falling short of being certain…

08:13.736 --> 08:16.260
You honor doctor-patient privilege.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.156
This just seems crazy to me.

08:18.156 --> 08:22.497
I mean, which side is 
better to err on?

08:28.345 --> 08:30.272
A trial today?

08:30.272 --> 08:31.850
Well, it's not exactly a trial.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.129
It's an evidentiary hearing.

08:33.129 --> 08:34.700
But I'd need to testify?

08:34.700 --> 08:37.028
It's the only way you can
get a restraining order.

08:37.028 --> 08:39.178
We'll lose the dress, by the way.

08:39.178 --> 08:40.808
Coat and tie.

08:41.191 --> 08:42.384
Alan, excellent!

08:42.384 --> 08:44.140
Alan, Gil Furnald…

08:44.140 --> 08:45.418
Alan Shore.

08:46.100 --> 08:51.159
Turns out that my Santa Claus
is a sort of cross-dressing sicko.

08:51.159 --> 08:52.957
He's more you.

08:52.957 --> 08:54.923
He is absolutely more me, Denny,

08:54.923 --> 08:56.306
but unfortunately, my schedule…

08:56.306 --> 09:00.828
Alan. I have trouble with this 
sort of subject matter.

09:00.828 --> 09:03.024
–You're homophobic.
–It's not that.

09:03.024 --> 09:04.646
What is it then?

09:04.954 --> 09:06.941
It's my father.

09:07.944 --> 09:09.565
Sometimes he wore dresses.

09:09.565 --> 09:15.183
He called it a kilt and sang all those
scottish songs, but we knew.

09:15.183 --> 09:18.844
Please. The hearing's at 2:00.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.439
Hello.

09:28.466 --> 09:29.493
Hello.

09:33.832 --> 09:34.724
Sally,

09:35.290 --> 09:38.044
could I trouble you
to do a quick background check?

09:38.044 --> 09:41.014
I realize we haven't spoken much
since we stopped having sex,

09:41.014 --> 09:45.684
And, frankly, I'm dismayed by that.

09:45.684 --> 09:49.130
But what I need to know is everything
you can find out about my new client.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.000
Here's his name, address,
and social security…

09:51.000 --> 09:53.504
Is it true you're taking 
over the Santa case?

09:53.504 --> 09:55.566
Yes, I am, Bradley.

09:55.566 --> 09:57.282
Is it of interest to you?

09:57.497 --> 10:00.172
No, but it could be…

10:00.172 --> 10:02.901
if we say, bet on it?

10:02.901 --> 10:04.989
Another wager.

10:04.989 --> 10:05.792
Why not?

10:05.792 --> 10:08.444
And would you already
have stakes in mind?

10:08.444 --> 10:10.862
I keep thinking about your elf.

10:10.862 --> 10:12.832
How about if you win, I become 
your elf for the day,

10:12.832 --> 10:15.756
but if you lose, you become mine?

10:15.756 --> 10:17.830
Complete with the costume, of course.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.805
–And bells.
–Can't leave out the bells.

10:19.805 --> 10:22.946
Alan, hey, can I steal you
for a second?

10:22.946 --> 10:23.888
A second?

10:23.888 --> 10:29.006
A minute I could maybe do,
but a second would be pushing it.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.935
Would you like me to push it?

10:32.427 --> 10:34.634
You are so disgustingly vulgar.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.262
It's important.

10:42.691 --> 10:44.595
This is Dr Königsberg.

10:44.595 --> 10:46.214
Alan Shore. —Hello.

10:46.472 --> 10:48.485
Oh, Alan Shore.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.258
Uh, Dr Königsberg has a patient

10:52.258 --> 10:55.674
who talks about killing his ex-wife
and could be serious about it.

10:55.674 --> 10:57.312
“Could” is the operative word.

10:57.312 --> 10:58.388
I can't be sure.

10:58.388 --> 11:00.667
Obviously, there are 
some exposure problems.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.859
I mean, if the guy does do it,

11:01.859 --> 11:05.059
and it was learned that Dr Königsberg
knew of the risks beforehand…

11:05.059 --> 11:07.004
The first thing I'd check
is his malpractice policy.

11:07.004 --> 11:09.732
You don't want to do anything
to void coverage.

11:09.732 --> 11:10.901
I've done that already.

11:10.901 --> 11:11.940
What's your specialty?

11:11.940 --> 11:13.013
Couples counseling.

11:13.013 --> 11:15.612
I first saw the client and 
his wife together.

11:15.612 --> 11:17.681
Since their divorce, I've been
working with him alone.

11:17.681 --> 11:19.617
So they came to you 
to improve their relationship,

11:19.617 --> 11:21.275
and now one wants to kill the other.

11:21.275 --> 11:23.807
Not your best work, was it, doctor?

11:25.365 --> 11:27.649
And you're seeing Dr Königsberg for what?

11:27.649 --> 11:30.490
Uh, just to deal with…

11:31.120 --> 11:34.207
as a lawyer, he hired me.

11:34.618 --> 11:36.134
He's a very mischievous man.

11:36.134 --> 11:37.995
Look, can we stick to the case, folks?

11:37.995 --> 11:40.285
Since the proposed victim was
or is a patient,

11:40.285 --> 11:42.009
you've got real duty problems.

11:42.009 --> 11:43.790
If the threat is real 
and you don't tell her…

11:43.790 --> 11:46.827
but I can't be sure it's real, which
means my duty is to the patient.

11:46.827 --> 11:48.375
Can you have another
therapist meet with him,

11:48.375 --> 11:49.681
perhaps, get an objective opinion?

11:49.681 --> 11:53.392
I've tried. No therapist will go near it
for fear of potential liability.

11:53.392 --> 11:55.523
Well, if it were me,
I'd meet with him myself,

11:55.523 --> 11:57.118
pretending to be one of 
your colleagues.

11:57.118 --> 11:58.910
That's hardly an option.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.174
Why? You need objectivity…

12:00.174 --> 12:02.632
You can't go there pretending 
to be a doctor.

12:02.632 --> 12:05.054
Of course I can't because I'm in trial,
but you can do it.

12:05.054 --> 12:06.513
Oh, sure, and get disbarred?

12:06.513 --> 12:08.397
I'd likely lose my license.

12:08.397 --> 12:11.111
Oh, well, silly me.

12:11.111 --> 12:12.559
I was thinking about the ex-wife.

12:12.559 --> 12:15.611
If it's merely a bar card and a medical
license you're looking to preserve,

12:15.611 --> 12:17.703
you first opine to Lori

12:17.703 --> 12:19.338
that you're not at all convinced the man

12:19.338 --> 12:20.915
intends to follow through on his threats,

12:20.915 --> 12:23.117
then you draft an opinion letter
to the doctor

12:23.117 --> 12:24.755
telling him he need not disclose.

12:24.755 --> 12:26.495
Your respective asses will be covered,

12:26.495 --> 12:27.760
and everybody's happy,

12:27.760 --> 12:29.486
assuming you like your asses covered.

12:29.486 --> 12:34.670
Personally, I love the feel of 
a stiff breeze against my rosy cheeks.

12:35.691 --> 12:38.803
In any event, pardon 
my misunderstanding.

12:38.803 --> 12:42.279
I thought it was potentially
human life at stake.

13:01.411 --> 13:02.269
Sylvia.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.148
What do you want now?

13:05.148 --> 13:06.649
Why do you always think
I want something?

13:06.649 --> 13:08.573
Why couldn't it be that I just 
want to see the smiling face

13:08.573 --> 13:10.836
of the prettiest girl in the clerk's office?

13:10.836 --> 13:12.654
What do you want, Brad?

13:12.654 --> 13:14.685
I need a small favor, tiny.

13:15.131 --> 13:17.835
But, first, please can I see that smile?

13:17.835 --> 13:20.228
God… —If I were 10 years younger…

13:20.228 --> 13:23.332
Or 10 years older.
What's the favor?

13:23.651 --> 13:25.409
There's a motion scheduled
for this afternoon.

13:25.409 --> 13:27.451
Furnald vs Gordon's department store.

13:27.451 --> 13:30.973
A lawyer named Alan Shore is seeking
injunctive relief, unlawful discharge.

13:30.973 --> 13:33.708
I need this case to fall
on judge Hingham's docket.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.617
Judge Hingham? 
Why would you want him?

13:35.617 --> 13:38.269
Because he's just right for this one.

13:38.269 --> 13:41.206
Exactly what kind of case is this?

13:41.475 --> 13:44.065
A homosexual?

13:44.065 --> 13:46.130
That's where we're at now?

13:46.130 --> 13:50.475
Santa Clauses being played
by homosexuals.

13:50.475 --> 13:53.338
I believe “homosexual” is 
one word, judge.

13:53.338 --> 13:55.410
But to avoid confusion, 
let's say “gay.”

13:55.410 --> 13:56.901
Let's say “transvestite.”

13:56.901 --> 13:58.513
because that was the stated reason…

13:58.513 --> 14:01.688
Well, if dress code is the issue,
my client promises to comply with…

14:01.688 --> 14:04.744
A homosexual transvestite…

14:04.744 --> 14:08.821
you want me to allow children
to sit in his lap?

14:08.821 --> 14:10.397
Exactly. —Oh, boy.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.371
Gordon's department store 
certainly supports

14:12.371 --> 14:14.906
Mr Furnald's right to choose 
who or what…

14:14.906 --> 14:17.906
That's a lie. You fired him 
as soon as he told you he was gay.

14:17.906 --> 14:21.085
No, we fired him for cross-dressing,
which is considered a fetish.

14:21.085 --> 14:23.353
He's played Santa for eight 
years without incident.

14:23.353 --> 14:27.265
In fact, he's received glowing praise
from both parents and employers.

14:27.265 --> 14:29.921
Would you sit in his lap?

14:29.921 --> 14:31.338
Sure. Why not?

14:39.301 --> 14:43.873
And he hasn't gone homo erectus
on me if that was your fear.

14:43.873 --> 14:46.338
You're making entendres.

14:46.338 --> 14:50.375
Disgusting, sick innuendo entendres.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.449
I'm not going to put an innocent child

14:52.449 --> 14:56.206
in the lap of an unnatural Santa Claus
who dresses in female attire.

14:56.206 --> 14:59.514
There is a sanctity 
to the tradition of Christmas.

14:59.514 --> 15:03.457
It is perhaps the most 
sanctimonious holiday there is.

15:03.457 --> 15:06.286
Then clearly you should be 
its poster boy.

15:08.182 --> 15:10.646
Motion for T.R.O. denied.

15:10.646 --> 15:13.666
I'd at least like an evidentiary hearing,
so that I may present… —Denied!

15:13.666 --> 15:15.910
Denied, denied, denied.

15:23.612 --> 15:24.939
Why did you do that?

15:24.939 --> 15:26.863
You antagonized him.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.347
Actually, he antagonized me.

15:31.271 --> 15:35.765
This job means something
to me, Mr Shore.

15:44.864 --> 15:46.081
Your honor.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.198
I have made my ruling.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.906
Yes, based on 
what you think my client is

15:50.906 --> 15:53.053
or what the defense has 
presented him to be.

15:53.053 --> 15:57.316
I ask you to at least hear from him
before you take away his livelihood.

15:57.316 --> 15:58.742
10 minutes,

15:58.742 --> 16:01.837
as to why he'd make 
a good Santa. Please.

16:04.629 --> 16:06.017
I'll give you 10 minutes.

16:06.017 --> 16:08.842
Five for direct, five for cross.

16:10.967 --> 16:12.883
I don't understand why she's here.

16:12.883 --> 16:14.219
I explained it, Brian.

16:14.219 --> 16:17.414
When a patient makes a credible 
threat to commit violence,

16:17.414 --> 16:20.736
my colleague is here to observe
because I may need counsel.

16:20.736 --> 16:21.704
Why?

16:21.704 --> 16:24.591
You should've told me this before.

16:24.591 --> 16:29.368
Brian, would you tell Dr Harper
why you want to kill your ex-wife?

16:31.894 --> 16:34.481
I have no intention of killing her.

16:36.051 --> 16:37.960
You don't? —Of course not.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.635
Murder is illegal in Massachusetts.

16:39.635 --> 16:42.079
So when you were saying these
things to Dr Königsberg…

16:42.079 --> 16:43.440
I never said them.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.620
Dr Königsberg is mistaken.

16:45.620 --> 16:49.338
I also have absolutely no intention
of paying for two therapists.

16:49.338 --> 16:50.529
Goodbye.

16:58.491 --> 17:00.197
Clearly he's a little hostile.

17:00.197 --> 17:04.211
Well, he's angry over you being here,
and I, I can't say that I blame him.

17:04.211 --> 17:06.704
I don't know if there's enough
to go to the police,

17:06.704 --> 17:09.644
but I think you should at least
tell his ex-wife.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.300
Will you go with me?

17:14.036 --> 17:16.134
Me? —Lori, I'm about to break privilege,

17:16.134 --> 17:17.963
and I could very well be sued for it.

17:17.963 --> 17:20.656
This is treacherous ground,
and I would like my lawyer present.

17:20.656 --> 17:23.417
So please do this with me.

17:36.763 --> 17:40.038
I'm afraid my words are 
having little impact.

17:40.038 --> 17:42.095
Yours will have to.

17:42.367 --> 17:43.518
Okay.

17:43.518 --> 17:45.868
You said this job means 
something to you,

17:45.868 --> 17:47.971
and you seemed rather impassioned.

17:47.971 --> 17:49.413
I am.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.036
You have a college education, 
Mr Furnald.

17:52.036 --> 17:53.653
You do well in your computer job.

17:53.653 --> 17:57.660
Why is this part-time employment
so important?

17:58.338 --> 17:59.295
I don't know.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.626
Yes, you do.

18:04.419 --> 18:06.235
I suppose,

18:07.743 --> 18:10.933
as a kid, a gay kid,

18:10.933 --> 18:13.425
who liked to wear dresses…

18:13.707 --> 18:15.817
that club is very small, by the way.

18:15.817 --> 18:19.467
Most cross-dressers are heterosexual.

18:19.467 --> 18:23.919
Anyway, um, as a kid who…

18:27.596 --> 18:31.351
felt like he didn't belong anywhere,

18:32.765 --> 18:39.999
I would throw myself into all the
make-believe that goes with Christmas.

18:41.095 --> 18:44.391
As safe retreats go,

18:45.136 --> 18:48.791
I suppose it helped me survive.

18:51.469 --> 18:53.878
And it still does.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.064
Should I say that tomorrow?

18:59.287 --> 19:01.102
Say all of it.

19:04.764 --> 19:06.400
Would you tell?

19:07.580 --> 19:08.926
I don't know.

19:09.573 --> 19:11.855
I mean, if it's a fantasy…

19:11.855 --> 19:13.599
What if it's not?

19:14.876 --> 19:18.282
The benefit of the doubt
has to go to privilege.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.136
Even when the downside is death?

19:22.464 --> 19:26.620
I'm not saying that it's an easy call.

19:33.636 --> 19:35.297
He got a hearing.

19:36.579 --> 19:37.483
Sorry?

19:37.483 --> 19:39.556
Shore, the cross-dressing Santa Claus.

19:39.556 --> 19:42.089
He actually got a hearing.

19:42.336 --> 19:44.758
Don't you think you're taking this 
bet thing a little too far?

19:44.758 --> 19:48.255
I'm not making a big deal about this.
I'm just making conversation here.

19:48.255 --> 19:52.113
Brad, you don't like Alan, do you?

19:55.110 --> 19:58.230
I don't give the guy a thought
one way or the other.

20:00.130 --> 20:03.854
Can I say something to you as a friend?

20:04.378 --> 20:08.399
You've seemed kind of knotted up
ever since he got here.

20:08.399 --> 20:12.196
It might help you if you just
let your feelings out a little.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.783
Come on, it's late at night,

20:14.783 --> 20:16.968
you're having a beer with a buddy.

20:16.968 --> 20:20.365
Tell me how you feel about Alan Shore.

20:23.414 --> 20:24.730
I don't like him.

20:24.730 --> 20:26.594
You can go deeper than that.

20:26.594 --> 20:27.919
What do you feel, Brad?

20:27.919 --> 20:30.500
I hate him. He mocks me.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.847
Deeper? —He mocks 
our commander in chief.

20:32.847 --> 20:35.101
Deeper. —He's got a putty 
ass and a flabby body,

20:35.101 --> 20:38.529
and I can't understand why women 
would rather sleep with him than me.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.183
There, it's out.

20:40.183 --> 20:42.341
And that includes you, by the way.

20:43.330 --> 20:46.143
First of all, I don't sleep with colleagues.

20:46.143 --> 20:47.929
–You're ducking the issue.
–I am not.

20:47.929 --> 20:51.799
I have no interest in ducking
either one of you.

20:53.456 --> 20:55.665
We've gone deep enough.

21:01.069 --> 21:03.948
I really need to win this bet.

21:09.528 --> 21:11.448
According to employees at Gordon's,

21:11.448 --> 21:14.127
Gil Furnald gets nothing 
but raves as Santa.

21:14.127 --> 21:16.189
Oh, come on, would you sit his lap?

21:16.189 --> 21:18.724
Why does everybody 
keep asking me that?

21:18.724 --> 21:21.082
Tough break drawing judge Hingham.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.696
Who'd ever imagine that?

21:25.558 --> 21:27.220
Brad,

21:28.630 --> 21:32.552
did you have something to do
with my drawing judge Hingham?

21:32.552 --> 21:34.593
That would be dirty pool.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.439
I actually want to feel
the life going out of her.

21:43.439 --> 21:44.775
I mean, with my hands.

21:44.775 --> 21:47.207
I want to feel her body go limp.

21:47.207 --> 21:50.023
Also, I want her to experience it.

21:50.023 --> 21:53.300
I want her to know that she's dying.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.276
And I don't want it to be instant.

21:55.276 --> 21:56.965
I want her to actually have the thought,

21:56.965 --> 21:59.239
“My God, he's killing me.”

21:59.239 --> 22:02.067
And I wanna see her eyes as I do it.

22:04.188 --> 22:06.944
What's happened to him?

22:06.944 --> 22:08.977
Let me reiterate.

22:08.977 --> 22:12.172
He's talked like this before without
ever going through with it, obviously.

22:12.172 --> 22:13.492
Many people fantasize…

22:13.492 --> 22:16.779
For him to even speak this way,
this is not Brian.

22:16.779 --> 22:18.192
He is docile person.

22:18.192 --> 22:19.698
I realize that.

22:19.698 --> 22:22.024
This might also simply be talk,

22:22.024 --> 22:24.962
safe talk that allows him to feel strong.

22:24.962 --> 22:26.942
Sometimes the weaker 
the person's constitution…

22:26.942 --> 22:29.064
Is he going to kill me?

22:30.382 --> 22:33.270
Mary, I'm here because I don't know.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.908
I really don't think so,

22:34.908 --> 22:38.682
but you are the one person
that knows him better than I do.

22:38.682 --> 22:41.444
I've never heard him talk like this, ever.

22:42.685 --> 22:44.992
Did you tell the police?

22:45.383 --> 22:48.532
It's tricky, Mrs Stevens.

22:48.532 --> 22:50.536
This is doctor-patient privileged stuff.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.039
We shouldn't even be telling you this.

22:52.039 --> 22:53.631
He plans to kill me, for God's sake.

22:53.631 --> 22:55.690
Which is why we are telling you,

22:55.690 --> 22:58.567
–on the possibility that these threats…
–I'm calling the police.

22:58.567 --> 23:01.422
I'm not sure that they could do
anything at this point.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.405
I mean, they certainly can't arrest him

23:03.405 --> 23:07.000
for things he told a therapist in confidence.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.270
What I would suggest,

23:08.270 --> 23:11.930
let Dr Königsberg continue
to monitor the situation.

23:11.930 --> 23:14.389
He's seeing your ex-husband every day.

23:14.389 --> 23:17.953
If things progress further,
we will call the police.

23:18.122 --> 23:20.283
In the meantime, maybe you could
stay with a friend…

23:20.283 --> 23:21.739
I have animals, I can't…

23:21.739 --> 23:24.372
Or get a friend to stay with you.

23:30.944 --> 23:34.010
I've been sitting in that chair
as Santa for eight years,

23:34.010 --> 23:36.708
and I have been an exemplary Santa.

23:36.708 --> 23:37.627
People will tell you,

23:37.627 --> 23:39.521
even if they don't shop at Gordon's,

23:39.521 --> 23:41.384
they come to see me.

23:41.384 --> 23:44.696
For how many of those eight years
have you been dressing as a woman?

23:44.696 --> 23:45.879
All of them.

23:45.879 --> 23:47.293
And in all this time,

23:47.293 --> 23:50.861
had your cross-dressing 
ever been an issue at work?

23:50.861 --> 23:53.309
No, I was always in the Santa costume.

23:53.309 --> 23:54.963
People never even knew.

23:54.963 --> 23:59.519
It was always my intention
to keep my worlds separate.

23:59.519 --> 24:02.535
So, it's been my secret.

24:02.535 --> 24:04.600
But your secret got out.

24:05.458 --> 24:09.089
Last week I had a boy 
in my lap, 8 years old.

24:09.089 --> 24:11.307
I asked him what he wanted for Christmas.

24:11.307 --> 24:16.661
He said, “Santa, please make me normal.”

24:16.661 --> 24:18.494
He was starting to cry as he said it.

24:18.494 --> 24:22.469
–He said, “make me normal.”
–Yes, he said, um,

24:22.469 --> 24:24.037
he said he was sick.

24:24.037 --> 24:26.085
He said that he liked to wear
girls' clothes,

24:26.085 --> 24:28.673
and he was sure he'd go to hell.

24:30.606 --> 24:32.317
And I said,

24:32.317 --> 24:36.342
“son, you're not alone.

24:36.755 --> 24:38.841
And you're not sick.”

24:39.934 --> 24:42.046
And I told him about me.

24:44.112 --> 24:45.488
Thank you, sir.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.084
So, while on the job,

24:52.084 --> 24:57.958
you told an 8-year-old boy
that Santa is a cross-dresser?

24:59.580 --> 25:01.164
Yes.

25:07.102 --> 25:08.208
Did the judge rule?

25:08.208 --> 25:11.046
No, miraculously, I persuaded him
to let me give a final statement,

25:11.046 --> 25:12.839
though I have no idea what to say.

25:12.839 --> 25:16.311
The fact that he told a child
he's a cross-dresser…

25:16.311 --> 25:18.434
I never should have 
put him on the stand.

25:18.434 --> 25:22.015
I've got to somehow 
make this a gay issue.

25:22.015 --> 25:25.029
Personally, I think you'll look
very sexy in the elf outfit.

25:25.029 --> 25:27.133
I have no doubt, 
yet I don't wanna lose.

25:27.133 --> 25:29.001
I've grown attached to this Santa.

25:29.001 --> 25:30.408
Brad seems pretty happy.

25:30.408 --> 25:31.377
Does he have reason?

25:31.377 --> 25:34.608
Denny, you said if I ever had
another hail mary emergency,

25:34.608 --> 25:37.197
you'd make the call. —Really.

25:37.197 --> 25:38.363
Are you sure?

25:38.363 --> 25:39.859
I need you to make the call.

25:39.859 --> 25:41.941
–And what's this about?
–It's extremely delicate.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.357
Though privilege typically extends 
to the whole firm,

25:44.357 --> 25:47.741
I have assured him that this would
go no further than you and me.

25:47.741 --> 25:48.803
Okay.

25:50.035 --> 25:53.990
Meet Brian Stevens.
Brian, this is the attorney I…

25:56.495 --> 25:57.551
What's going on?

25:57.551 --> 25:59.540
–This is your client?
–You're an attorney?

25:59.540 --> 26:00.913
Um, yes.

26:00.913 --> 26:03.082
You said you were a doctor!

26:03.082 --> 26:05.296
What the hell is going on?

26:05.657 --> 26:07.881
Uh, Paul, we have a conflict.

26:07.881 --> 26:11.015
I represent the therapist
who was treating Mr Stevens.

26:11.015 --> 26:13.056
She's the one who went to my ex-wife.

26:13.056 --> 26:15.652
She's the one who told Mary
I planned on killing her.

26:15.652 --> 26:17.937
She pretended to be a doctor!

26:29.027 --> 26:30.794
He can see you for about five minutes.

26:30.794 --> 26:34.112
–After that, his day is completely…
–Five minutes is more than enough.

26:34.112 --> 26:35.160
You can go in.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.314
Thank you.

26:40.571 --> 26:42.262
Thank you so much for 
agreeing to see me.

26:42.262 --> 26:44.397
My name is Alan Shore, and I…

26:52.244 --> 26:53.163
Go.

26:53.163 --> 26:56.517
My name is Alan Shore.
Perhaps you'll remember…

26:57.554 --> 26:59.511
Everyone has a name, son.

26:59.511 --> 27:01.476
I'm not interested in yours.

27:01.476 --> 27:05.308
You have five minutes 
because you know him.

27:07.424 --> 27:09.274
Bill Clinton?

27:13.163 --> 27:17.276
Ah, well, you'll remember
at the behest of Mr Crane,

27:17.276 --> 27:19.840
you made an appearance
in one of my cases

27:19.840 --> 27:22.559
involving an African American 
little orphan Annie,

27:22.559 --> 27:24.735
and you were extremely effective.

27:24.735 --> 27:26.513
“Give us a black spider-man,

27:26.513 --> 27:29.449
give us a black superman
who can leap tall buildings”

27:29.449 --> 27:31.300
all the big icons.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.102
Now I have another case,

27:33.102 --> 27:36.409
featuring a gay man who's 
being discriminated against.

27:36.409 --> 27:42.358
And this one involves the biggest 
icon of them all, Santa Claus.

27:42.358 --> 27:44.970
My problem is the judge.

27:44.970 --> 27:49.055
His tiny brain has been
calcified by intolerance.

27:49.055 --> 27:53.432
However, he's certainly a slave to
public opinion, as judges tend to be.

27:53.432 --> 27:56.038
But I can't really move the public.

27:56.038 --> 27:58.000
You can.

27:58.342 --> 28:00.458
Do you understand what I'm asking?

28:00.458 --> 28:02.358
You want me to be your rabbit.

28:02.358 --> 28:06.586
I want you to be reverend Al Sharpton
in all his massive glory.

28:06.586 --> 28:08.480
I want you to charge in there,

28:08.480 --> 28:10.590
say “Give us a gay Santa Claus,”

28:10.590 --> 28:14.385
and button it with
three God almighties. —Stop.

28:15.171 --> 28:18.256
I don't do things big. I'm subtle.

28:18.256 --> 28:21.555
Yes. Three God almighties.

28:21.555 --> 28:24.678
Look, I've written it all out for you.

28:26.166 --> 28:27.968
Give that a look-see.

28:27.968 --> 28:30.288
I've seen you move mountains, 
reverend.

28:30.288 --> 28:35.467
I need you to move 
this one tiny-brain judge.

28:35.467 --> 28:36.991
Please.

28:40.172 --> 28:42.073
Pretty please.

28:44.114 --> 28:45.851
Denny Crane.

28:51.232 --> 28:53.168
–You got Sharpton?
–I don't know.

28:53.168 --> 28:54.537
He said he'd think about it.

28:54.537 --> 28:56.787
Does he just do this kind
of thing now, for lawyers?

28:56.787 --> 28:59.750
He does it for Denny.
Let's hope he does it for me.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.119
All set?

29:03.259 --> 29:06.390
You don't want me to miss 
the ruling, do you?

29:06.834 --> 29:08.279
Got the costume.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.864
My God,

29:19.864 --> 29:23.042
to impersonate a doctor.

29:23.042 --> 29:25.716
I thought a human life was at stake,
and I didn't know…

29:25.716 --> 29:28.204
It doesn't matter, Lori.

29:28.204 --> 29:31.245
You're suddenly gonna
start playing Solomon

29:31.245 --> 29:34.256
and break rules, sacred rules,

29:34.256 --> 29:36.028
whenever you see fit?

29:36.028 --> 29:39.053
I could be disbarred for this.

29:39.053 --> 29:41.254
You? Why?

29:41.254 --> 29:43.591
For not turning you in.

29:45.672 --> 29:47.459
I'm sorry, Paul, I just…

29:47.459 --> 29:48.854
I'm sorry.

29:49.092 --> 29:51.448
I think it's this Alan Shore character.

29:51.448 --> 29:53.742
Ever since he got here… —This has
nothing to do with Alan Shore.

29:53.742 --> 29:55.221
I'm not influenced by him.

29:55.221 --> 29:58.666
You used to be influenced by me.

30:00.850 --> 30:02.786
Tell me what you want me to do.

30:02.786 --> 30:04.604
I'll resign if…

30:04.604 --> 30:06.412
just tell me what you want.

30:06.412 --> 30:09.361
First, I want you to apologize 
to Mr Stevens.

30:09.361 --> 30:11.722
–I did that.
–Well, you need to do it again,

30:11.722 --> 30:15.940
and hope to God he doesn't sue us.

30:21.094 --> 30:23.265
How long have you known this man, Paul?

30:23.265 --> 30:26.852
Years, only through work.

30:28.377 --> 30:31.654
But he doesn't strike me
as being capable of violence,

30:31.654 --> 30:34.328
if that's what you're asking.

30:36.676 --> 30:38.448
I'll get him back in here.

30:38.448 --> 30:41.373
And on the chance that he could
be violent,

30:41.373 --> 30:43.461
when you apologize,

30:43.461 --> 30:46.323
I will be in the room.

30:49.092 --> 30:52.647
And for the sake of humoring me,

30:52.647 --> 30:57.572
let's stay completely away from
Alan Shore.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.164
What's all the media doing here?

31:12.164 --> 31:14.483
I have no idea.

31:14.483 --> 31:16.031
All rise.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.160
Uh-oh. —What?

31:21.160 --> 31:23.611
We're 10 minutes early.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.123
Please be seated.

31:40.033 --> 31:46.004
Mr Phillips, have you got anything
to say before I listen to him?

31:47.932 --> 31:49.592
Mr Furnald was fired

31:49.592 --> 31:54.415
mainly because my clients feared he'd
share his secret proclivity with a child,

31:54.415 --> 31:57.083
which, by his own testimony,

31:57.083 --> 31:59.383
is exactly what he did.

32:04.638 --> 32:07.875
I object to that summation.
It was entirely too short.

32:07.875 --> 32:10.400
What? —I'm only worried for you, 
your honor.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.230
If you're inclined to rule against us,

32:12.230 --> 32:15.976
he's got to at least give you
a good argument to hang your hat on.

32:15.976 --> 32:19.915
So, it looks good to all this media.

32:20.194 --> 32:22.843
Did you notice the media here?

32:23.328 --> 32:25.106
Are you on drugs?

32:25.106 --> 32:27.377
You've got 30 seconds.

32:27.377 --> 32:29.473
That's what I was afraid of.

32:31.970 --> 32:34.053
Your honor, the child in question,

32:34.053 --> 32:37.971
who my client shared his secret with,
that child was in pain.

32:37.971 --> 32:39.614
Being a good Santa Claus,

32:39.614 --> 32:42.338
Gil Furnald sought to relieve that pain.

32:42.338 --> 32:45.158
By telling him he was a homosexual?

32:45.158 --> 32:47.566
Those three little words again.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.048
He did not tell the boy he was gay.

32:51.048 --> 32:53.319
He only said that he also 
liked to dress in female attire.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.534
Why does he keep looking back here?

32:55.534 --> 32:57.120
I have no idea.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.664
He encouraged the boy not 
to feel that he was sick.

33:00.664 --> 33:02.866
He urged him not to feel alone.

33:02.866 --> 33:04.745
It was a one-time occurrence

33:04.745 --> 33:08.246
strictly intended to speak 
to the heart of this one child.

33:08.246 --> 33:11.912
There is no evidence that this man
has committed any wrongdoing,

33:11.912 --> 33:13.795
nor is there any compelling evidence

33:13.795 --> 33:15.950
that cross-dressers
are inherently lascivious,

33:15.950 --> 33:17.549
and the defendant knows that.

33:17.549 --> 33:19.162
Cross-dressing is but a pretext

33:19.162 --> 33:21.303
that the defendant has hung its hat on

33:21.303 --> 33:25.581
to disguise the fact that Gil Furnald
was terminated because he is gay.

33:25.581 --> 33:27.644
Last time I checked, 
it was not a firing offense for

33:27.644 --> 33:30.143
a civilian to be either ho, mo, or sexual.

33:30.143 --> 33:31.966
All right, already, I've heard enough.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.106
–I'm going to rule on this.
–You can't rule yet.

33:34.106 --> 33:34.971
Why not?

33:34.971 --> 33:36.339
I don't know.

33:36.339 --> 33:41.126
Well, what if, say, some big celebrity
were to come charging through the door?

33:41.126 --> 33:43.516
Sorry I'm late, judge,
I'll make this quick.

33:43.516 --> 33:44.904
and subtle.

33:44.904 --> 33:46.337
Who the hell are you?

33:46.337 --> 33:48.759
The image of Santa Claus 
has been crafted

33:48.759 --> 33:52.583
for hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of years.

33:52.583 --> 33:54.508
We're supposed to be in a different day.

33:54.508 --> 33:58.163
Give the world a black Santa Claus.

33:58.163 --> 34:00.842
Let the people have an African American

34:00.842 --> 34:05.065
come down the chimney 
bearing joy and good will.

34:05.065 --> 34:06.925
Gay, not black.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.605
The prejudice against 
gay people must stop.

34:10.605 --> 34:13.130
We all say we're for gay rights,

34:13.130 --> 34:16.380
we all say we accept homosexuality.

34:16.380 --> 34:17.839
But give a gay man a hug,

34:17.839 --> 34:19.560
–sit in his lap… 
–Who is this man?

34:19.560 --> 34:23.376
Let the bells of tolerance
ring out this Christmas.

34:23.376 --> 34:28.364
Let people open their minds as they 
open their presents underneath the tree.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.641
We need your mind, judge, today.

34:30.641 --> 34:33.268
Let the gay man be my brother,

34:33.268 --> 34:34.702
be your brother,

34:34.702 --> 34:36.326
be the school teacher,

34:36.326 --> 34:38.411
be the construction worker.

34:38.411 --> 34:41.507
Give the world a gay Santa Claus,

34:41.507 --> 34:45.009
God almighty, God almighty, God almighty.

34:45.009 --> 34:48.873
Leave out the cookies
and the milk this Christmas eve

34:48.873 --> 34:53.962
for a holly jolly homosexual, God almighty.

34:53.962 --> 34:55.679
And cut.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.291
I threw in one extra.

35:04.291 --> 35:05.433
Thank you.

35:29.833 --> 35:32.527
One of the reasons why I've been
such an even-tempered business man

35:32.527 --> 35:34.995
is because I've been able
to find an outlet,

35:34.995 --> 35:38.324
a safe confidential outlet
with my therapist.

35:38.324 --> 35:41.038
But you must admit, threatening 
to kill your ex-wife like this, it is…

35:41.038 --> 35:43.992
Ms Colson, I've been 
in therapy since I was 16.

35:43.992 --> 35:46.874
I spent most of those sessions
planning on how to kill my father.

35:46.874 --> 35:48.283
They're rants.

35:48.283 --> 35:50.556
They help me get the anger out.

35:50.923 --> 35:52.664
This is gonna ruin me.

35:52.664 --> 35:55.158
Mary acts on hysteria.

35:55.158 --> 35:58.815
She's gonna panic, and 
this is going to get out.

35:59.036 --> 36:00.384
They're rants.

36:00.384 --> 36:02.718
They help me get the anger out.

36:03.085 --> 36:04.998
This is gonna ruin me.

36:04.998 --> 36:07.491
Mary acts on hysteria.

36:07.491 --> 36:11.008
She's gonna panic, and 
this is going to get out.

36:11.008 --> 36:13.025
Let us talk to Mary.

36:13.025 --> 36:15.239
Perhaps we can settle her down.

36:15.611 --> 36:18.643
I'll lose my job if this goes public.

36:18.643 --> 36:22.437
Let us try to unring this bell a little.

36:22.697 --> 36:23.999
Okay.

36:28.319 --> 36:30.583
We need to fix this.

36:30.583 --> 36:31.459
How?

36:31.459 --> 36:34.447
We go to the wife,
and we explain that you overreacted.

36:34.447 --> 36:36.788
She saw the tape for herself, Paul. 
It's not gonna…

36:36.788 --> 36:39.158
we further explain that people say things

36:39.158 --> 36:40.904
to their therapists that sometimes…

36:40.904 --> 36:41.968
We did that.

36:41.968 --> 36:43.095
Well, we'll do it again.

36:43.095 --> 36:45.266
–Where does she live?
–Weston.

36:45.266 --> 36:47.662
We'll leave here at 5:00.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.607
I don't wanna talk about it.

37:13.986 --> 37:15.473
You won?

37:15.473 --> 37:17.238
Judge Hingham, horror that he is,

37:17.238 --> 37:20.802
bowed to public sentiment and 
reinstated Gil as Santa.

37:23.913 --> 37:25.763
And, if you don't mind,

37:25.763 --> 37:27.933
I would like to get back to 
work as soon as I can.

37:27.933 --> 37:31.851
Could I steal you for just 
a minute in private?

37:31.851 --> 37:32.966
Sure.

37:42.230 --> 37:44.013
Listen, um,

37:44.833 --> 37:46.264
thank you,

37:46.264 --> 37:48.833
not just for getting my job back, but,

37:48.833 --> 37:50.890
well, it's not often that
you meet a lawyer

37:50.890 --> 37:53.204
with a soft spot for cross-dressers.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.650
Well, now you have, Mr Furnald.

37:55.650 --> 37:57.285
It wasn't that so much.

37:57.285 --> 38:02.548
It's just from everything I've heard,
you are a magnificent Santa Claus.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.519
Thank you.

38:05.224 --> 38:06.746
You're quite welcome.

38:19.542 --> 38:21.959
I guess you should take the lead
with her since you know her.

38:21.959 --> 38:23.562
I also know her lawyer.

38:23.562 --> 38:26.522
All I can say is I hope
she hasn't contacted him yet.

38:26.522 --> 38:29.465
Because if he should get
a hold of this…

38:29.715 --> 38:31.233
What the…

38:37.881 --> 38:39.735
Dear God, no.

38:56.038 --> 38:57.000
What happened?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.587
Homicide. The ex-husband just 
showed up, and…

38:59.587 --> 39:01.978
Where is he?
He's represented.

39:01.978 --> 39:03.729
I don't think a lawyer's
gonna help him, counsel.

39:03.729 --> 39:05.039
I want to speak with him.

39:05.039 --> 39:06.719
I don't think that's gonna happen, either.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.359
He's over there.

39:14.496 --> 39:16.474
What, what happened?

39:16.474 --> 39:20.252
He showed up. She says 
he came here to kill her,

39:20.252 --> 39:22.761
said she fired in self-defense.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.233
Mary…

39:38.831 --> 39:41.365
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

39:42.946 --> 39:44.626
What happened?

39:44.626 --> 39:46.132
He showed up,

39:47.103 --> 39:49.792
said we needed to talk.

39:49.792 --> 39:53.908
I didn't trust it, you know,
after what I saw on that tape.

39:54.158 --> 39:55.962
I got the gun out of the drawer,

39:55.962 --> 39:57.549
told him to leave.

39:57.549 --> 39:59.959
He said he just wanted to talk.

39:59.959 --> 40:02.618
I told him, “get out.”

40:04.398 --> 40:07.676
And then he started walking toward me.

40:07.676 --> 40:10.185
And you shot him.

40:13.019 --> 40:16.493
He was gonna kill me, right?

40:17.340 --> 40:19.441
You told me.

40:20.065 --> 40:23.332
He was gonna strangle me.

40:25.128 --> 40:27.848
Promise me I had to do it.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.501
Promise me.

40:31.943 --> 40:34.601
.

40:34.601 --> 40:38.020
.

40:38.020 --> 40:42.076
.
