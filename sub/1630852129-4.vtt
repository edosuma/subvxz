and I'm like,
"Where do I go from here?"

16:31.281 --> 16:34.576
First of all, I find Tom
a little bit more difficult

16:34.660 --> 16:36.328
to connect with.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.455
- Like, if I'm being
completely honest,

16:38.539 --> 16:40.541
I actually feel like
I'm starting to get

16:40.624 --> 16:42.835
a little connection...
- Really?

16:42.918 --> 16:44.712
- With him.
- Okay.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.423
Like--like--like, more
than just, like, friends?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.091
- Yeah.
- Ooh, okay.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.760
- I don't want to overstep,
and I don't want to, like,

16:51.844 --> 16:55.347
disrupt the process, and so--
- Fair, and I appreciate that.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.307
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
I never want to be that person.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.893
- Maybe he might feel something
towards you.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.563
I don't know.
And, like, I would love if...

17:02.646 --> 17:03.939
you guys would--
- Yeah.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.233
- 'Cause, like,
we're here for love.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.693
Like, we're all here for that.
- We're all here.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.069
- You know?
- Right, exactly.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.654
- And so there's no shortage
of love

17:10.738 --> 17:11.947
in the universe, you know?

17:12.030 --> 17:13.282
- No. No, absolutely not.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.908
<i>- When he tells me that he has</i>

17:14.992 --> 17:17.327

<i>my first thought is,</i>

17:17.411 --> 17:19.246
"I'm running out of time
to choose someone

17:19.329 --> 17:21.248
to take home to meet
my family."

17:21.331 --> 17:24.084
And I'm wondering, like,
am I gonna find someone

17:24.168 --> 17:26.128
who I can make a very strong
connection with?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.005

Okay.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.684
we don't have that connection

- Yeah?

18:28.899 --> 18:32.986
- So where do you stand
with me?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.239
- Okay, so right now--

18:35.322 --> 18:37.407
right now, I have a connection
with Nicci that's been growing,

18:37.491 --> 18:39.243
and I've been enjoying my time
with her.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.744
Last couple of dates have gone

18:40.828 --> 18:42.371
a long way into solidifying
the fact

18:42.454 --> 18:44.248
that I do feel
the most comfortable with her.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.375
And so I've been
exploring that.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.336
- That's not about me.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.630
Where do you stand with me?

18:51.713 --> 18:54.341
Not with anyone else,
with me.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.052
- Okay, so right now with you,
you know, I felt like

18:57.135 --> 19:00.389
we kind of--
we had a connection.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.850
It's not the same connection
I have with Nicci.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.560
- Yeah, you have a connection
with Nicci,

19:04.643 --> 19:07.980
but if you focus only on that,
it makes the rest of us

19:08.063 --> 19:11.024
feel like, "Why are we still
showing up?"

19:11.108 --> 19:12.401
- Yeah, I get that.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.820
- Yeah, so come on.
Let's have that convo.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.114
<i>I don't know what's going on</i>
<i>in that man's mind,</i>

19:17.197 --> 19:21.159
but it's extremely difficult
because it puts me in a place

19:21.243 --> 19:23.078
where I'm overthinking
about it,

19:23.161 --> 19:25.873
<i>and hey, if he could just</i>
<i>vocalize how he feels,</i>

19:25.956 --> 19:27.499
<i>it would just make things</i>
<i>a lot faster</i>

19:27.583 --> 19:29.751
so that, way we're not
wasting any more time.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.044
So...

19:31.128 --> 19:33.130
- I'm, like, doing my best

19:33.213 --> 19:34.590
to make, you know, connections,

19:34.673 --> 19:37.634
and I'm not done exploring
our connection.

19:37.718 --> 19:41.305
That said, I don't really feel
like I regret

19:41.388 --> 19:43.432
any of the decisions I've made
up to this point,

19:43.515 --> 19:47.644
since, you know,
Nicci's came into the house.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.188
- I'm not done exploring
either, but I've been

19:50.272 --> 19:52.900
up in the air a lot, and I feel
like in the beginning,

19:52.983 --> 19:57.571
I was very confident,
and I have had moments with you

19:57.654 --> 20:00.157
where I've opened up,
I've opened up about who I am,

20:00.240 --> 20:04.578
and did I show you a part of me
that I'm still kind of

20:04.661 --> 20:06.914
vulnerable of,
and did I show you that

20:06.997 --> 20:08.999
for no reason?

20:09.082 --> 20:11.752
I show as much respect
and patience as possible,

20:11.835 --> 20:15.172
but it's to a level
where I'm like--

20:15.255 --> 20:16.423
I don't feel like
I'm gonna be--

20:16.506 --> 20:17.591
- You feel disrespected?

20:17.674 --> 20:19.343
- I feel disrespected.
- Okay.

20:19.426 --> 20:22.304
- Because, like, was anything
real, you know?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.014
- Hang on a second.
- I can't even have this--

20:24.097 --> 20:25.307
- I have to back you up.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.017
There's a reason
why you're still here,

20:27.100 --> 20:30.103
but I can't say that, you know,
I'm in the same place

20:30.187 --> 20:31.939
that maybe I even was in
a few days ago, and just,

20:32.022 --> 20:34.358
I'm not in that mindset
right now.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.901
But--
- Because your mindset

20:35.984 --> 20:38.236
is with Nicci.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.447
- Yeah.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.617
- I'm not saying to filter how
you guys feel about each other,

20:43.700 --> 20:47.120
but you guys are flauntin' it
in our faces.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.249

I can only choose one person

21:04.137 --> 21:05.347
- End of the day,
