00:03.492 --> 00:05.992
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.994 --> 00:07.595
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.596 --> 00:10.588
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.699 --> 00:12.533
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.534 --> 00:14.402
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé,</i>

00:14.403 --> 00:16.771
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.772 --> 00:19.272
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.408 --> 00:20.841
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.842 --> 00:22.977
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.978 --> 00:24.845
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.846 --> 00:26.747
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.748 --> 00:28.149
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.150 --> 00:30.017
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.018 --> 00:31.752
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.753 --> 00:35.211
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.558 --> 00:38.993
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:38.994 --> 00:41.690
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.797 --> 00:44.297
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.399 --> 00:46.899
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.836 --> 00:50.464
I have this source
who told me about you.

00:50.539 --> 00:53.372
I don't know where he lives,
where he works.

00:53.442 --> 00:55.942
But he knows.
He knows everything.

00:56.812 --> 00:57.812
I'm proud of you.

00:57.813 --> 01:00.181
What? Of me?

01:00.182 --> 01:02.483
I've worked
with a lot of people.

01:02.484 --> 01:04.983
You make it look easy.

01:05.319 --> 01:08.687
The Alliance knows
you pursued Khasinau.

01:08.757 --> 01:10.391
They're going to want to see

01:10.392 --> 01:13.225
that your priorities
are in order.

01:15.464 --> 01:18.228
Are you suggesting that
I allow you to kill my wife

01:18.300 --> 01:21.098
to enhance my standing
within The Alliance?

01:26.274 --> 01:28.774
You'll meet
with Sark in Denpasar,

01:28.844 --> 01:32.439
disguised as a representative
from the Raslak Jihad.

01:33.982 --> 01:37.008
I'll cover you while you
broker the deal with Sark

01:37.085 --> 01:39.849
for the counterfeit
Rambaldi solution.

01:44.993 --> 01:46.827
Sydney, it's Dixon.

01:46.828 --> 01:48.129
He's here.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.630
Hands in the air!

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.407 --> 02:01.842
Take position over there,
but cover fire only.

02:01.843 --> 02:04.343
I don't want Bristow hurt.

02:31.006 --> 02:33.040
Sark's got the real ampule!

02:33.041 --> 02:35.669
I'm on him.
Head for the extraction point.

02:38.647 --> 02:41.147
Cover me!

02:56.164 --> 02:58.664
Freeze!

02:59.034 --> 03:01.832
Turn around.
Hands on your head.

03:13.315 --> 03:15.815
I don't want to hurt you.

03:19.020 --> 03:21.750
Freelancer, are you
at the extraction point yet?

03:29.297 --> 03:32.994
Eagle Eye, I've got the ampule.
I need a 20 on Freelancer.

03:33.068 --> 03:34.635
You cannot leave Sark.

03:34.636 --> 03:37.136
Damn it, where is she?

03:55.624 --> 03:57.291
Go.

03:57.292 --> 03:59.792
Go!

04:21.983 --> 04:23.284
Hello?

04:23.285 --> 04:25.845
You said
you were back on the story.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.388
Why haven't you published?

04:27.389 --> 04:28.889
I need something from you.

04:28.890 --> 04:32.087
You're going to tell
your contact you want a meeting

04:32.193 --> 04:34.361
to take place
at your contact's discretion.

04:34.362 --> 04:37.092
Why would he lead me to you,
knowing you'd flush him out?

04:37.165 --> 04:40.225
He told you my name so you'd
realize my threat was a bluff,

04:40.302 --> 04:41.535
that I'd never hurt Sydney,

04:41.536 --> 04:43.771
even if you continued
your investigation.

04:43.772 --> 04:46.639
He didn't expect you'd have
the guts to contact me.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.342
I'll assume
that's a compliment.

04:48.343 --> 04:51.437
When you ask for the meeting,
your contact will refuse.

04:51.513 --> 04:53.447
- What do I say?
- You say...

04:53.448 --> 04:55.948
I know something
you'll be interested in.

04:56.985 --> 04:58.986
I know about The Circumference.

04:58.987 --> 05:01.683
- What's The Circumference?
- It's not your concern.

05:01.756 --> 05:03.757
I got to know
what I'm talking about.

05:03.758 --> 05:06.852
You tell him if he wants to know
more, he'll have to meet.

05:06.961 --> 05:10.795
Look, just meet with me
because I tell you,

05:10.865 --> 05:13.200
I'm sick of this
cloak-and-dagger crap.

05:13.201 --> 05:15.002
Very well, Mr. Tippin.

05:15.003 --> 05:17.767
You'll be contacted
with instructions.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.317
I'm sure I speak

05:30.318 --> 05:32.818
for our distinguished friend
from Los Angeles

05:32.854 --> 05:36.915
when I say we appreciate your
coming on such short notice.

05:37.025 --> 05:39.026
I know it reflects
your understanding

05:39.027 --> 05:41.527
that the business before us
today is as difficult

05:41.596 --> 05:46.431
as it is vital to the very
survival of our organization.

05:46.501 --> 05:49.527
I understand you have
some prepared remarks. Please.

05:50.672 --> 05:52.506
Thank you, Ramon.

05:52.507 --> 05:55.442
Before I begin, should we wait

05:55.510 --> 05:58.104
until all the other members
have arrived?

05:58.179 --> 06:00.679
That won't be necessary.

06:03.785 --> 06:06.948
I feel rather awkward
sitting here

06:07.021 --> 06:09.615
asking you to allow my wife
to die of cancer.

06:09.691 --> 06:12.285
Arvin, the agreement is simple.

06:12.394 --> 06:17.388
People with any unauthorized
information regarding SD-6

06:17.499 --> 06:21.230
or any SD cell
must be eliminated.

06:22.203 --> 06:26.037
My wife is being eliminated...

06:26.107 --> 06:28.108
by cancer.

06:28.109 --> 06:31.545
The pending bone-marrow biopsy
reports will merely inform us

06:31.613 --> 06:34.343
as to the number of days
she has left,

06:34.416 --> 06:37.351
days that she will spend
in an SD-6 hospital,

06:37.419 --> 06:40.286
where information
can be contained.

06:41.756 --> 06:43.624
Should you choose to intervene,

06:43.625 --> 06:46.617
naturally,
I'll be forced to resign.

06:46.728 --> 06:51.859
Something I believe you should
factor into your decision.

06:53.301 --> 06:57.704
Now, in the past 12 years,
SD-6 has made for The Alliance

06:57.772 --> 07:00.272
over $400 million
in arms sales alone,

07:00.341 --> 07:03.401
plus another $300 million
from various transactions

07:03.478 --> 07:05.145
with Ineni Hassan.

07:05.146 --> 07:08.843
In addition, we have acquired
more Rambaldi artifacts

07:08.917 --> 07:11.852
than all the SD cells combined.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.378
Your service to The Alliance
is unquestioned...

07:15.457 --> 07:17.624
with one exception.

07:17.625 --> 07:21.220
We know you had our colleague
Jean Briault assassinated.

07:24.199 --> 07:27.930
You know about Poole, don't you?

07:28.002 --> 07:30.596
That's why he's not here.

07:32.774 --> 07:35.572
You know that Khasinau
had him in his pocket.

07:36.311 --> 07:38.811
Our former colleague
has, under duress,

07:38.880 --> 07:41.610
acknowledged his connection
with Mr. Khasinau,

07:41.683 --> 07:44.051
and his manipulation of you

07:44.052 --> 07:47.249
that led to Briault's
unfortunate passing.

07:48.156 --> 07:51.148
Faced with a breach
of this magnitude,

07:51.259 --> 07:53.759
we have re-evaluated
our position

07:53.828 --> 07:57.025
regarding peaceful coexistence
with Khasinau.

07:57.098 --> 08:00.659
We know you have
advocated a war with Khasinau.

08:00.735 --> 08:04.364
The Alliance is now
fully prepared

08:04.439 --> 08:06.939
to engage in such an action.

08:08.209 --> 08:11.542
I am relieved and gratified.

08:13.047 --> 08:16.505
He is an enemy worthy
of our combined resources.

08:16.584 --> 08:21.021
You must have a vision of how
this is supposed to play out.

08:21.089 --> 08:24.616
I am assuming that your plan
ends in assassination.

08:24.726 --> 08:27.593
Yes, that's right.
Assassination of Khasinau.

08:27.662 --> 08:30.162
Then your plan must change.

08:30.198 --> 08:33.929
If we abduct Khasinau,
or, worse yet, kill him,

08:34.001 --> 08:36.835
we will never
have an opportunity to learn

08:36.905 --> 08:42.172
what it is he is after
or how he works,

08:42.243 --> 08:44.743
or with whom.

08:45.413 --> 08:48.940
Put away your need for revenge.

08:49.017 --> 08:51.251
Find out what you can.

08:51.252 --> 08:55.154
Bring us substantial intel,

08:55.256 --> 08:59.716
and we will take
your wife's situation

08:59.794 --> 09:02.294
under advisement.

09:21.249 --> 09:22.883
Hey.

09:22.884 --> 09:25.384
Miss me?

09:27.021 --> 09:29.521
So, how was...

09:29.757 --> 09:31.358
Palm Springs.

09:31.359 --> 09:32.526
Perfect.

09:32.527 --> 09:34.094
Right, right.
The desert.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.529
I actually read a book.

09:35.530 --> 09:36.997
You didn't go with anyone?

09:36.998 --> 09:39.099
Will and Francie both had work.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.600
It was good, actually,
being alone.

09:41.636 --> 09:43.270
I needed time to decompress.

09:43.271 --> 09:45.771
Hmm.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.340
We've reacquired
Khasinau's trail.

09:50.011 --> 09:51.244
We have?

09:51.245 --> 09:54.043
Mm-hmm.
We apprehended Sark in Denpasar.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.849
Turns out
there was a second ampule.

09:55.850 --> 09:58.785
We intercepted a communiqué
detailing Sark's plan to buy it

09:58.853 --> 10:00.787
from the Raslak Jihad.

10:00.788 --> 10:02.322
Did you get the ampule?

10:02.323 --> 10:04.985
No.
Sark didn't have it on him.

10:05.093 --> 10:07.593
Hmm.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.501
I'm gonna read
the op-tech report.

10:14.502 --> 10:17.002
Catch up on what I missed.

10:17.905 --> 10:20.405
Sydney.

10:20.508 --> 10:23.875
For the record,
I did miss you.

11:11.059 --> 11:12.826
Oh, Mr. Bristow.

11:12.827 --> 11:15.327
I'm just here to give
Sydney a ride to work.

11:15.430 --> 11:17.930
Sure. Come on in.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.200
I've got to go.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.201
Bye.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.702
Bye, Francie.

11:24.572 --> 11:26.373
Kretchmer briefed me
on Denpasar.

11:26.374 --> 11:28.642
It was a sloppy operation.

11:28.643 --> 11:32.272
Your pursuit of your mother
is clouding your judgment.

11:32.346 --> 11:34.347
And at the moment,
I can't protect you.

11:34.348 --> 11:36.683
I haven't regained
Sloane's trust.

11:36.684 --> 11:38.685
He hasn't reinstated me
to active duty.

11:38.686 --> 11:40.587
I'm not even privy
to his briefings.

11:40.588 --> 11:43.614
Then you haven't heard
that SD-6 got Sark.

12:01.542 --> 12:05.034
While this might not seem like
a particularly good day for you,

12:05.113 --> 12:07.214
you'd be surprised.

12:07.215 --> 12:11.083
We have people here
trained in torture.

12:12.453 --> 12:13.987
And they are so good,

12:13.988 --> 12:16.389
I sometimes
take them for granted.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.890
But I'm not in the mood
for torture.

12:19.827 --> 12:22.990
No, there's been
enough torture lately.

12:25.767 --> 12:28.531
We've been somewhat curious
about your employer.

12:30.104 --> 12:32.172
Alexander Khasinau.

12:32.173 --> 12:36.906
Well, you're in good company.

12:36.978 --> 12:39.379
Yes.

12:39.380 --> 12:40.814
But we have you.

12:40.815 --> 12:43.083
Indeed.

12:43.084 --> 12:46.053
I need to find your employer.

12:48.189 --> 12:50.851
You raise an interesting point.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.893
Given my current state
of affairs,

12:52.894 --> 12:55.863
it doesn't seem as if
my affiliation with Mr. Khasinau

12:55.930 --> 12:58.430
is long for this Earth.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.802
We both know you're
a very clever young man,

13:01.803 --> 13:04.738
so we don't need to play games.

13:04.806 --> 13:07.468
You're valuable to me.

13:07.542 --> 13:10.204
You can help me find Khasinau.

13:11.279 --> 13:15.181
I'm valuable to you, obviously.

13:17.218 --> 13:21.245
I understand I am in no position
to demand anything,

13:21.322 --> 13:25.224
but for the record,
I'm far more comfortable talking

13:25.326 --> 13:27.954
over a glass
of Chateau Petreuse.

13:29.664 --> 13:32.164
'82.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.760
Why does that guy have
such a guilty look on his face?

13:34.836 --> 13:38.465
Yesterday, Ginger told Rod
that Gavin was Ruby's pimp,

13:38.539 --> 13:40.540
but Rod didn't even know
that Ruby was a prostitute.

13:40.541 --> 13:43.009
- Who's Gavin?
- Ruby's father.

13:43.010 --> 13:45.510
- Ew.
- Right.

13:46.647 --> 13:49.343
- Will.
- Huh? Hi.

13:51.986 --> 13:55.581
Oh, what happened to Ruby's dad?

13:55.656 --> 13:57.958
Where are you?

13:57.959 --> 14:00.894
I just got this work thing.

14:01.729 --> 14:04.130
Listen carefully, Mr. Tippin.

14:04.131 --> 14:06.691
I'm about to give you
instructions on where to meet.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.267
They must be followed
to the letter.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.800
Guess who just
tore me a new one.

14:14.876 --> 14:16.509
Devlin.

14:16.510 --> 14:18.144
Now ask me why.

14:18.145 --> 14:19.312
Why?

14:19.313 --> 14:20.881
I took a bullet for you today.

14:20.882 --> 14:24.181
He wanted to know why you left
Sark when he wasn't secured.

14:24.252 --> 14:27.380
I said I told you to, I misread
the feed from the satellite,

14:27.455 --> 14:29.623
I thought the recovery team
was nearby.

14:29.624 --> 14:32.286
- Thank you.
- I lied to save your ass.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.861
That's what partners do
for each other.

14:34.862 --> 14:37.362
- I said thank you.
- I don't want your thanks.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.899
I want it to stop.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.034
Sydney's my responsibility.

14:41.035 --> 14:43.370
I'm not gonna trivialize
your relationship

14:43.371 --> 14:44.537
by calling it a crush.

14:44.538 --> 14:47.268
But whatever it is,
it's starting to affect me.

14:47.341 --> 14:48.842
If that sounds selfish to you,

14:48.843 --> 14:51.343
I was hoping to retire
fully vested.

14:58.019 --> 15:00.220
I know you genuinely
care for her.

15:00.221 --> 15:02.721
I do, too.

15:02.723 --> 15:04.858
That we have been sworn
not to cross.

15:04.859 --> 15:07.359
We're about a mile past that.

15:09.630 --> 15:11.765
I don't know how to be
Sydney's handler

15:11.766 --> 15:13.733
without making it personal.

15:13.734 --> 15:16.234
Figure out a way.

15:32.119 --> 15:35.748
I was only half serious
when I asked for the Petreuse.

15:35.823 --> 15:38.587
I just assumed,
after what Khasinau's done.

15:38.693 --> 15:41.127
Sending men
into this facility,

15:41.128 --> 15:43.430
murdering some of your men.

15:43.431 --> 15:45.931
That, regardless of what I said,

15:45.933 --> 15:48.433
you'd split my belly
with a hunting knife.

15:48.469 --> 15:52.098
Do you think that's the kind
of activity the CIA engages in?

15:53.507 --> 15:56.007
Not the CIA.

16:00.481 --> 16:04.076
Khasinau sent you to Moscow
to negotiate with K-Directorate.

16:04.151 --> 16:06.386
He trusts you.

16:06.387 --> 16:08.254
You know things.

16:08.255 --> 16:10.755
I suppose I better know things.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.560
However, to be clear,

16:13.561 --> 16:16.061
my employer hardly tells me
everything.

16:26.540 --> 16:29.040
Mmm.

16:47.495 --> 16:51.124
We will collaborate, you and I.

16:51.232 --> 16:53.792
You will lead me to Khasinau.

16:53.868 --> 16:56.368
Understood?

16:59.707 --> 17:02.207
May I?

17:11.719 --> 17:14.219
Understood?

17:14.954 --> 17:17.454
Understood.

17:20.194 --> 17:21.493
As it turns out,

17:21.494 --> 17:25.192
our Mr. Sark is a very
cooperative young man.

17:25.266 --> 17:27.534
We have received
independent confirmation

17:27.535 --> 17:29.602
for the intel
he's provided thus far.

17:29.603 --> 17:33.004
It seems that Mr. Sark's loyalty
to Khasinau disappeared

17:33.074 --> 17:34.941
the moment
that he was kidnapped.

17:34.942 --> 17:36.409
So, what's the move?

17:36.410 --> 17:38.545
Sark wasn't scheduled

17:38.546 --> 17:40.880
to make contact with Khasinau
until Thursday.

17:40.881 --> 17:43.316
They've arranged to meet
at a club in Paris

17:43.317 --> 17:44.451
that Khasinau owns.

17:44.452 --> 17:45.785
That's where you're going.

17:45.786 --> 17:47.554
Is this an abduction?

17:47.555 --> 17:49.289
No.

17:49.290 --> 17:51.624
Khasinau is expecting
the ampule.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.560
According to Sark, Khasinau
needs the solution in it

17:54.628 --> 17:57.927
in order to read a Rambaldi
document that contains text

17:57.998 --> 18:01.195
written in Rambaldi's
now-familiar invisible ink.

18:01.235 --> 18:05.103
This Rambaldi page will be
at the Paris location.

18:05.172 --> 18:07.540
Sark will be provided
with a counterfeit ampule,

18:07.541 --> 18:09.542
which he will pass on
to Khasinau.

18:09.543 --> 18:12.876
Your job is to steal this
Rambaldi page from his office

18:12.947 --> 18:15.507
and replace it
with a counterfeit.

18:15.583 --> 18:16.850
I don't understand.

18:16.851 --> 18:19.513
We've been hunting Khasinau
for months.

18:19.587 --> 18:22.988
We're gonna be in the same room
as the guy,

18:23.057 --> 18:24.824
and you want us
to go after a document?

18:24.825 --> 18:27.293
Let's just get
the son of a bitch.

18:27.294 --> 18:31.594
Sydney, no one wants Khasinau
more than I do.

18:31.665 --> 18:34.165
No one.

18:36.637 --> 18:40.164
Sark has provided us
with detailed plans of the club,

18:40.241 --> 18:42.642
its operation,
and location of the vault.

18:42.643 --> 18:46.238
Luckily, an employee of the club
is about to call in sick.

18:46.313 --> 18:49.339
It's been arranged for you
to take her place.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.151
Marshall will provide you
with the op tech.

18:54.121 --> 18:56.851
Um...

18:56.924 --> 18:59.424
Oh, how's your voice?

19:00.828 --> 19:03.328
Why?

19:09.303 --> 19:10.870
I was contacted.

19:10.871 --> 19:12.238
- Were you followed?
- No.

19:12.239 --> 19:14.474
Tell me
what precautions you took.

19:14.475 --> 19:17.137
I didn't use my blinkers,
I avoided the inner lanes,

19:17.211 --> 19:18.645
I circled the block
every three miles.

19:18.646 --> 19:19.846
What did your contact say?

19:19.847 --> 19:21.915
- He wants to meet.
- Good.

19:21.916 --> 19:25.010
You'll be picked up by men
in a van. They'll be armed.

19:25.085 --> 19:28.179
You'll be blindfolded
and taken to another location.

19:28.255 --> 19:29.856
I know what that feels like.

19:29.857 --> 19:32.382
But they will not hurt you.
They need you.

19:32.493 --> 19:34.127
They're gonna take me
to Deep Throat.

19:34.128 --> 19:36.722
Or someone who works for him.

19:38.732 --> 19:41.067
There's a transmitter
sewn into the lining.

19:41.068 --> 19:42.368
What if they frisk me?

19:42.369 --> 19:43.670
It's too small to be detected.

19:43.671 --> 19:45.838
- What were the terms?
- Terms?

19:45.839 --> 19:47.740
Time, place,
oral or visual tell?

19:47.741 --> 19:49.108
There's a street corner.

19:49.109 --> 19:51.544
I'm supposed to be reading
a local paper.

19:51.545 --> 19:53.846
- When?
- Tomorrow night, 7:00.

19:53.847 --> 19:55.381
Where?

19:55.382 --> 19:57.882
Paris.

20:03.891 --> 20:06.259
Tell me my countermission
is to grab Khasinau.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.127
- It's not.
- Well, it should be.

20:08.128 --> 20:11.564
Nobody wants me
to take him into custody?

20:11.665 --> 20:13.833
SD-6 must not get
the Rambaldi document.

20:13.834 --> 20:18.464
In transit, you'll replace
what Dixon took from the vault.

20:18.539 --> 20:20.006
Just switch the pages?

20:20.007 --> 20:22.507
Yes.
These are counterfeit.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.244
Do you have questions
about the mission?

20:27.114 --> 20:29.614
No, I do not.

20:31.118 --> 20:32.619
Vaughn, what's going on?

20:32.620 --> 20:34.120
Nothing.
Do you have any questions?

20:34.121 --> 20:36.222
I want to know
what's going on with you.

20:36.223 --> 20:39.590
You're acting not like yourself.

20:39.693 --> 20:41.527
I'm fine.
But I should go.

20:41.528 --> 20:44.088
Good luck.

20:44.198 --> 20:46.698
Thanks.

20:55.309 --> 20:58.801
I couldn't go through this
without you.

21:04.318 --> 21:07.253
Dr. Levin and I discussed
your pain management.

21:09.423 --> 21:11.923
Arvin...

21:12.960 --> 21:17.988
I don't want to be here
in the hospital when...

21:21.869 --> 21:24.369
I want to be home.

21:25.472 --> 21:27.972
Promise me.

21:30.010 --> 21:32.510
I promise.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.124
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

21:45.125 --> 21:46.392
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

22:09.450 --> 22:10.450
<i>Très bien.</i>

22:10.451 --> 22:12.951
<i>Madame?</i>

22:19.860 --> 22:20.860
<i>Madame?</i>

22:22.096 --> 22:23.763
You could say
it's a friendship ring.

22:23.764 --> 22:25.998
Something to signify
platonic intimacy

22:25.999 --> 22:28.900
between a guy and a girl,
which people say is impossible,

22:28.969 --> 22:31.631
that a guy and a girl would...
We're friends.

22:32.172 --> 22:33.373
Right.

22:33.374 --> 22:36.002
Okay, this actually is
a cardiac event recorder.

22:36.076 --> 22:39.273
Khasinau's vault uses
biometric access control.

22:39.346 --> 22:40.580
No code, no key, nothing.

22:40.581 --> 22:43.379
So this will detect
heartbeat signatures.

22:43.450 --> 22:46.817
A unique one because Khasinau
suffers from fibrillation.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.554
What you want to do
is put this on

22:48.555 --> 22:50.223
or on top of his thorax

22:50.224 --> 22:52.492
or anywhere that you might
get a pulse,

22:52.493 --> 22:54.660
and then it will transmit
the ECG data

22:54.661 --> 22:56.262
to Dixon's cellphone,

22:56.263 --> 22:59.357
who will use that to fool
the biometric sensor.

22:59.466 --> 23:00.500
<i>Voilà.</i>

23:00.501 --> 23:03.001
Open sesame.

23:05.406 --> 23:06.939
<i>Merci.</i>

23:19.887 --> 23:21.187
Take this.

23:21.188 --> 23:22.855
What's this?

23:22.856 --> 23:24.357
A time-release methamphetamine

23:24.358 --> 23:26.325
to counteract the effects
of sodium pentothal.

23:26.326 --> 23:29.386
Sodium pentothal.
Like a truth serum?

23:29.496 --> 23:30.830
They're gonna give me that?

23:30.831 --> 23:32.098
I would.

23:32.099 --> 23:33.599
Great.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.569
Don't worry. I'll be
monitoring you the whole time.

23:36.637 --> 23:39.137
You have
your cover story straight?

23:41.008 --> 23:42.608
They're gonna kill me.

23:42.609 --> 23:45.011
If they wanted that,
you would have been dead.

23:45.012 --> 23:47.346
They need you because you're
gonna publish the story

23:47.347 --> 23:50.180
and because you know
about The Circumference.

23:50.250 --> 23:51.784
I wouldn't let you do this

23:51.785 --> 23:53.753
if I thought the odds
were in favor of your murder.

23:53.754 --> 23:54.754
Great.

23:54.755 --> 23:57.781
I'll have a recording
of your interrogator's voice,

23:57.858 --> 23:59.559
possibly of your contact's,

23:59.560 --> 24:01.594
if he's foolish enough
to make an appearance.

24:01.595 --> 24:04.095
Either way,
we have a lead to trace.

24:23.584 --> 24:25.017
Ah, Mr. Sark.

24:25.018 --> 24:26.018
Mr. Khasinau.

24:26.019 --> 24:27.520
Ah.

24:27.521 --> 24:30.456
I hear you have some troubles
in Denpasar.

24:30.524 --> 24:32.625
It's good
to have you back safe.

24:32.626 --> 24:33.626
Thank you.

24:33.627 --> 24:36.127
Please.

24:42.336 --> 24:44.836
Can I see the ampule?

24:49.176 --> 24:51.676
Shall we proceed to my office?

24:51.678 --> 24:54.113
Make sure you keep Khasinau
at his table,

24:54.114 --> 24:57.550
and in case you have
any thoughts of warning him,

24:57.618 --> 24:59.552
I would advise against it.

24:59.553 --> 25:02.181
We'll be taking precautions.

25:02.256 --> 25:05.020
I took the liberty of ordering.

25:05.826 --> 25:06.926
Yes.

25:06.927 --> 25:07.927
Okay, good idea.

25:07.928 --> 25:10.428
Yes, we celebrate
your success first.

25:31.919 --> 25:37.050
<i># You #</i>

25:37.124 --> 25:44.189
<i># Made me leave
my happy home #</i>

25:44.298 --> 25:51.898
<i># You took my love,
and now you're gone #</i>

25:52.639 --> 26:02.514
<i># Since I fell for you #</i>

26:02.583 --> 26:07.782
<i># My life #</i>

26:07.854 --> 26:15.659
<i># Brings such misery and pain #</i>

26:15.729 --> 26:23.295
<i># I know
I'll never be the same #</i>

26:23.370 --> 26:30.435
<i># Since I fell for you #</i>

26:33.780 --> 26:37.511
<i># It's too bad #</i>

26:37.584 --> 26:41.350
<i># And it's too sad #</i>

26:41.421 --> 26:46.916
<i># But I'm in love with you #</i>

26:48.862 --> 26:50.296
Almost got it, Syd.

26:50.297 --> 26:52.797
A couple more seconds.

26:58.338 --> 27:00.838
Get in the van, Mr. Tippin.

27:02.275 --> 27:06.041
All right, I got it.
I'm heading to the vault, Syd.

27:06.113 --> 27:08.147
<i># I #</i>

27:08.148 --> 27:18.023
<i># Well, I guess
I'll never see the light #</i>

27:18.091 --> 27:25.088
<i># I get the blues
most every night #</i>

27:26.400 --> 27:39.803
<i># Since I fell for you #</i>

27:44.317 --> 27:46.817
No, no.

27:56.663 --> 27:58.664
We have the young man
from Los Angeles.

27:58.665 --> 28:00.766
Mm-hmm. Proceed.

28:00.767 --> 28:03.267
Come.

28:37.671 --> 28:39.338
We're good, Syd.

28:39.339 --> 28:41.864
I'll meet you out back
in two minutes.

28:41.942 --> 28:44.143
Your arm, please.

28:44.144 --> 28:46.579
So, are you the person
I've been talking to?

28:46.580 --> 28:48.214
He will be along shortly.

28:48.215 --> 28:50.249
First, we have questions.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.017
What's that, sodium pentothal?

28:52.018 --> 28:53.018
Yes.

28:53.019 --> 28:56.785
So that our conversation
will go smoothly.

28:56.857 --> 28:58.224
Tell me, Mr. Tippin,

28:58.225 --> 29:01.126
how did you find out
about The Circumference?

29:05.999 --> 29:07.566
I heard about it.

29:07.567 --> 29:10.067
From who?

29:10.203 --> 29:12.204
The name, Mr. Tippin.

29:12.205 --> 29:14.705
The name?

29:15.175 --> 29:17.675
Okay.

29:29.890 --> 29:32.390
Aah!

29:34.628 --> 29:36.295
What the hell's going on?

29:36.296 --> 29:37.797
How did you get here?

29:37.798 --> 29:40.132
Will, listen to me.
How did you get here?

29:40.133 --> 29:41.567
What the hell's happening?

29:41.568 --> 29:44.068
I was following a story.

29:45.272 --> 29:46.572
We have to move.

29:46.573 --> 29:49.073
Come on.
Come on.

29:50.944 --> 29:53.572
I can't get to you. I'll see you
at the extraction point.

29:53.647 --> 29:56.147
I'll meet you in 30 minutes.

29:57.617 --> 30:00.117
Vitroly!

30:01.354 --> 30:03.854
Stop!

30:18.772 --> 30:21.272
We're going out the front!

30:26.813 --> 30:29.313
- Get down.
- Okay.

30:50.070 --> 30:52.570
Will!

30:54.808 --> 30:56.442
- Get in!
- Oh, Jack, thank God!

30:56.443 --> 30:58.943
- He came here with you?!
- Get down!

31:00.213 --> 31:01.513
It's Bristow.

31:01.514 --> 31:03.816
I need a full identity switch
and escort.

31:03.817 --> 31:05.084
How could you bring him?

31:05.085 --> 31:06.919
For his protection,
we should not discuss this.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.480
There are considerations
you do not understand!

31:09.556 --> 31:12.056
Who the hell are you people?

31:14.027 --> 31:16.689
This one has no field
experience. He needs a makeover.

31:16.796 --> 31:18.163
Go with him.
It's okay.

31:18.164 --> 31:20.664
Which part of this is okay?

31:21.368 --> 31:23.068
- Take off your clothes.
- What?

31:23.069 --> 31:25.569
Now!

31:26.273 --> 31:28.140
Pay attention.

31:33.079 --> 31:35.347
Your name is Patrice Lafont.

31:35.348 --> 31:39.375
You were born in Nantes,
where you live until you were 5.

31:39.452 --> 31:40.686
Okay.

31:40.687 --> 31:42.454
How could you
bring him into this?

31:42.455 --> 31:44.523
He was looking
into Danny's death.

31:44.524 --> 31:45.658
Sloane found out.

31:45.659 --> 31:48.184
I had to keep Security Section
from executing him.

31:48.295 --> 31:49.495
Why didn't you tell me?

31:49.496 --> 31:51.931
Someone, possibly in
Intelligence, contacted him.

31:51.932 --> 31:53.232
Very highly placed.

31:53.233 --> 31:55.501
They've been steering him
toward SD-6.

31:55.502 --> 31:57.236
They told him about me.

31:57.237 --> 31:59.538
We're pursuing a lead
to track his source.

31:59.539 --> 32:01.840
No one from Intelligence
was in that club.

32:01.841 --> 32:04.935
Those people interrogating Will
work for Khasinau.

32:06.279 --> 32:08.779
He wants to bring down SD-6.

32:08.782 --> 32:11.083
He tried and failed with Cole.

32:11.084 --> 32:13.780
Articles in the press
would be equally effective.

32:13.853 --> 32:16.088
None of this changes the fact
that you were using Will.

32:16.089 --> 32:17.890
He was already being used.

32:17.891 --> 32:20.985
It's no coincidence out of all
the reporters, he was chosen.

32:21.094 --> 32:22.361
What are you saying?

32:22.362 --> 32:27.061
For some reason,
Khasinau is trying to expose us.

32:41.147 --> 32:43.877
You cannot tell anyone
about this.

32:43.950 --> 32:46.450
Not anyone.

32:49.689 --> 32:52.189
Do you promise me?

32:55.328 --> 32:57.828
Okay.

33:02.135 --> 33:04.635
I'll see you at home.

33:11.544 --> 33:13.445
The Daniels are planning

33:13.446 --> 33:16.210
to fly out to visit next week.

33:17.450 --> 33:19.950
I think that's
a very good idea, sweetheart.

33:19.986 --> 33:23.319
Bold of me to make plans
for next week, don't you think?

33:23.390 --> 33:25.024
Come on, honey.

33:25.025 --> 33:29.553
Arvin, you have to
keep your sense of humor.

33:29.662 --> 33:32.162
Yeah, I suppose I do.

33:33.233 --> 33:35.034
Honey?

33:35.035 --> 33:37.560
Are you there?

33:37.637 --> 33:40.504
Yes, Emily, I am.

33:40.573 --> 33:43.167
Listen, darling,
I need to take this phone call.

33:43.243 --> 33:44.777
All right?

33:44.778 --> 33:46.545
See you soon, my love.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.113
Yes.

33:48.114 --> 33:50.614
Yes, I will.

33:51.684 --> 33:52.751
Alain.

33:52.752 --> 33:54.720
Nice work in Paris.

33:54.721 --> 33:58.851
You have deprived Khasinau
of a valuable prize.

33:58.958 --> 34:00.726
Yes, thank you.

34:00.727 --> 34:03.227
The Alliance has decided...

34:04.931 --> 34:08.297
...due to your wife's illness,
her condition,

34:08.368 --> 34:11.804
your request has been approved.

34:11.871 --> 34:14.772
Your wife will be spared.

34:27.454 --> 34:30.184
Base ops, this is Freelancer.

34:30.255 --> 34:32.755
Freelancer?

34:45.138 --> 34:46.672
Syd.

34:46.672 --> 34:48.340
I want to ask you something,

34:48.341 --> 34:50.841
and I need you
to give me a straight answer.

34:50.844 --> 34:52.143
Of course.

34:52.145 --> 34:54.645
I know your arm is hurt.

34:55.047 --> 34:57.548
How'd it happen?

34:58.384 --> 35:01.080
I was hiking
in the San Jacinto mountains,

35:01.154 --> 35:03.055
and I lost my footing
on a scree,

35:03.056 --> 35:05.684
and I suddenly found myself
in this rockslide.

35:05.792 --> 35:08.292
I gashed it pretty bad.

35:08.661 --> 35:09.995
You should have told me.

35:09.996 --> 35:13.056
We're supposed to let each other
know about our injuries.

35:13.166 --> 35:15.666
Full disclosure.

35:15.835 --> 35:18.335
Full disclosure.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.827
Sark must have
tipped off Khasinau.

35:41.828 --> 35:44.763
It's the only way to explain
why his men came after me.

35:44.831 --> 35:47.561
Well, that complication
notwithstanding,

35:47.634 --> 35:49.301
the mission was a success.

35:49.302 --> 35:51.136
But we lost Sark.

35:51.137 --> 35:53.338
When Sark arrived at the club

35:53.339 --> 35:56.274
and Khasinau's team failed
to detect a tracking device,

35:56.342 --> 35:58.902
he must have thought
that I was bluffing.

35:58.978 --> 36:02.573
Now, the truth is that I was
prepared for such a possibility.

36:02.649 --> 36:05.379
When he asked
for a bottle of wine,

36:05.451 --> 36:07.553
I had Security Section
lace it

36:07.554 --> 36:10.717
with a nonlethal dose
of a radioactive isotope.

36:10.790 --> 36:13.258
We have a geosynchronous
satellite in orbit

36:13.259 --> 36:15.661
designed to detect
particle decay.

36:15.662 --> 36:18.756
We have been tracking Sark
since he left the club.

36:21.434 --> 36:22.634
Where is he?

36:22.635 --> 36:26.127
He's on a transatlantic flight,
hopefully with Khasinau.

36:26.206 --> 36:28.674
It's too soon
to project his destination,

36:28.675 --> 36:32.111
but when he lands, we'll vector
a team to his position.

36:33.313 --> 36:35.813
That's all.
You can go.

36:37.217 --> 36:40.243
Sydney, stay for a minute,
would you?

36:42.655 --> 36:44.523
Emily told me
that you visited her

36:44.524 --> 36:47.024
at the hospital last week

36:47.026 --> 36:49.620
and that you had
a nice conversation.

36:51.898 --> 36:54.398
Yes, we did.

36:55.301 --> 36:57.603
I know some of the things
she said

36:57.604 --> 37:00.971
indicated her awareness
of what we do here.

37:02.542 --> 37:04.543
And that usually, such a breach

37:04.544 --> 37:07.104
would proscribe
a deliberate course of action.

37:07.180 --> 37:09.842
You know that
better than anyone.

37:11.050 --> 37:14.508
Because she's not likely
to last the week...

37:16.723 --> 37:19.521
I was able
to sustain a reprieve.

37:22.962 --> 37:25.030
I'm glad.

37:25.031 --> 37:26.698
Yes, I knew you would be.

37:26.699 --> 37:29.361
That's why
I wanted to thank you

37:29.435 --> 37:31.935
for being such a good friend
to Emily.

37:34.107 --> 37:36.607
And to me.

37:38.211 --> 37:42.375
It was your duty to report
Emily to Security Section.

37:42.448 --> 37:44.948
You didn't.

37:46.452 --> 37:48.952
And that's more
than I did for you.

37:52.959 --> 37:55.928
Tell me you're not
feeling sympathy for Sloane.

37:55.995 --> 37:58.495
No.

37:58.665 --> 38:01.259
It's just the first time
I've seen him express regret

38:01.334 --> 38:03.235
for what he did to Danny.

38:03.236 --> 38:04.703
He would kill you

38:04.704 --> 38:07.204
if he knew we were
having this conversation.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.741
You're right.

38:09.742 --> 38:12.044
I read your debrief.
So did Devlin.

38:12.045 --> 38:14.446
We'll deal with the loss
of the Rambaldi document later,

38:14.447 --> 38:16.181
but first, you should know

38:16.182 --> 38:18.980
that Office of Securities
is drawing up

38:19.052 --> 38:22.783
a contingency plan
to keep Will Tippin safe.

38:22.855 --> 38:24.623
What kind of contingencies?

38:24.624 --> 38:26.992
Witness protection.
Worst case, recruitment.

38:26.993 --> 38:28.293
Absolutely not.

38:28.294 --> 38:30.794
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

38:30.830 --> 38:31.930
Hopefully,
it won't come to this.

38:31.931 --> 38:33.332
You're not bringing him
into this life.

38:33.333 --> 38:36.564
He is in this life now,
whether you like it or not.

38:37.904 --> 38:39.471
He is my friend.

38:39.472 --> 38:41.873
He is one of my best friends.

38:41.874 --> 38:43.008
I understand that.

38:43.009 --> 38:45.509
No, you don't.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.114
You get to tell your friends
that you work for the CIA,

38:51.184 --> 38:54.676
while I go home and look
desperately for a tiny moment

38:54.754 --> 38:58.212
that I can be honest
with anyone about anything.

38:59.792 --> 39:02.292
Now that Will
knows the truth...

39:03.563 --> 39:06.063
he's never gonna
trust me again.

39:09.869 --> 39:12.838
You should have
seen his face in Paris.

39:14.374 --> 39:16.641
It was like he was
looking at a stranger.

39:16.642 --> 39:18.577
But he wasn't.

39:18.578 --> 39:21.240
He was looking at you.

39:21.314 --> 39:24.681
Maybe for the first time.

39:24.751 --> 39:27.251
He was looking at you.

39:42.935 --> 39:44.102
What is this place?

39:44.103 --> 39:46.603
We're in the middle of L.A.

39:46.606 --> 39:49.200
You have places
like this everywhere?

39:50.410 --> 39:53.470
I told you
not to pursue this story.

39:53.546 --> 39:56.046
I know you did.

39:56.048 --> 39:58.548
Danny was killed
because he knew.

39:59.952 --> 40:01.753
Because I told him.

40:01.754 --> 40:04.254
They were gonna kill me, too.

40:05.191 --> 40:08.388
That's why you asked
for my sister's passport.

40:09.862 --> 40:11.663
I know that you have
questions,

40:11.664 --> 40:18.092
and I would like to answer them,
but I can't.

40:20.673 --> 40:23.733
I am so afraid that you know
anything about me at all.

40:23.810 --> 40:26.211
I only went after this story
because of Danny.

40:26.212 --> 40:29.340
You didn't have answers as to
who killed the man you loved,

40:29.415 --> 40:31.915
and I just couldn't
stand that.

40:32.919 --> 40:35.419
It broke my heart.

40:35.421 --> 40:37.921
I wanted to help.

40:38.858 --> 40:40.792
But you got to know this.

40:40.793 --> 40:42.894
I'm not gonna ask you a thing.

40:42.895 --> 40:45.659
I am not gonna ask
anyone anything.

40:45.731 --> 40:48.231
You never have to worry
about that.

40:48.835 --> 40:51.036
You promise me.

40:51.037 --> 40:53.631
Because Danny just left
a message on the machine.

40:53.706 --> 40:56.573
Syd, I promise you.

40:56.642 --> 40:59.044
Never.

40:59.045 --> 41:01.878
I was thinking
on the flight back

41:01.948 --> 41:04.448
what your life's like...

41:05.952 --> 41:08.019
...what you have to go through,

41:08.020 --> 41:12.719
what you've had to
keep from your friends,

41:12.825 --> 41:15.453
how hard that must be.

41:16.496 --> 41:20.933
Syd, I don't love you
because of what you do

41:21.000 --> 41:23.500
or what you don't do.

41:24.470 --> 41:26.970
I just love you.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.413
Thank you.

41:35.414 --> 41:37.415
Thank you.

41:37.416 --> 41:39.916
You saved my life.

41:43.022 --> 41:45.522
Sir, Mr. Sark
has landed in Geneva.

41:45.591 --> 41:47.893
How long
before you can have a team?

41:47.894 --> 41:50.727
One hour. Do we have
authorization to apprehend Sark?

41:50.796 --> 41:53.356
Yeah. You have it.

41:54.867 --> 41:56.668
Guys, is there a food situation?

41:56.669 --> 41:59.433
Is there any chance
I can get something to eat?

41:59.505 --> 42:02.201
Like a burger or something?

42:02.275 --> 42:04.775
I'm easy.

42:07.013 --> 42:09.948
I am sorry
to keep you both waiting.

42:10.016 --> 42:11.683
It's okay, Doctor.

42:11.684 --> 42:13.685
I apologize
for being underprepared.

42:13.686 --> 42:15.420
I just got the tests back.

42:15.421 --> 42:18.288
I thought you'd want to know.

42:22.862 --> 42:24.829
The pain we suspected
might indicate

42:24.830 --> 42:26.598
a recurrence of the lymphoma

42:26.599 --> 42:29.099
appears to be due
to the rapid regrowth

42:29.168 --> 42:31.668
of your bone-marrow elements.

42:32.538 --> 42:35.974
That's wonderful.

42:36.042 --> 42:37.175
Isn't it?

42:37.176 --> 42:38.710
In fact...

42:38.711 --> 42:42.647
the lymphoma cells appear
to be decreasing significantly.

42:43.382 --> 42:46.613
Emily, you're entering
remission.

42:46.686 --> 42:50.452
Now, these are
only preliminary tests.

42:50.523 --> 42:53.788
Your blood panels
will tell us more, but...

42:53.893 --> 42:56.393
Arvin.

43:03.869 --> 43:06.369
Oh, God.

43:11.243 --> 43:13.743
Oh.

43:20.319 --> 43:22.819
Alpha team position.

43:28.027 --> 43:30.527
Sloane wants Sark alive.

43:52.318 --> 43:54.946
There's nothing here
but medical equipment.

43:55.021 --> 43:57.888
Blood bags, pump.

43:57.957 --> 44:00.457
The son of a bitch
had a transfusion.

44:20.780 --> 44:22.113
Oh, yeah.

44:22.114 --> 44:24.614
30 minutes or less.
