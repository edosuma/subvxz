WEBVTT

00:05.300 --> 00:06.099
Ready?

00:06.134 --> 00:09.060
Action.

00:09.095 --> 00:10.395
I don't know.

00:10.429 --> 00:13.564
Oh, come on!

00:13.599 --> 00:14.365
Why can't you admit

00:14.399 --> 00:15.934
That you're in love with me?

00:15.968 --> 00:17.802
Why are you in love with me?

00:17.836 --> 00:20.105
Because you're beautiful.

00:20.139 --> 00:20.806
Look at your face

00:20.840 --> 00:22.040
In the moonlight.

00:22.075 --> 00:23.208
I can't.

00:23.243 --> 00:24.343
You can.

00:24.378 --> 00:25.978
No, a person can't look

00:26.013 --> 00:26.679
At their own face,

00:26.714 --> 00:29.913
It's impossible.

00:29.947 --> 00:30.413
Then marry me,

00:30.447 --> 00:31.347
And I'll buy you

00:31.382 --> 00:32.949
A thousand mirrors.

00:32.983 --> 00:34.684
But that's so many.

00:34.718 --> 00:36.853
My father's a billionaire.

00:36.854 --> 00:37.587
I can give you

00:37.621 --> 00:39.821
Everything you've ever wanted,

00:39.856 --> 00:42.656
And I'm very good looking.

00:42.690 --> 00:45.192
Um, yeah.

00:45.226 --> 00:46.360
Think.

00:46.394 --> 00:49.730
And lights go.

00:51.400 --> 00:51.933
It's okay

00:51.967 --> 00:53.034
That you don't know.

00:53.069 --> 00:54.603
But you deserve an answer.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.004
I can wait,

00:56.039 --> 00:56.438
For you,

00:56.472 --> 00:58.406
I would wait a thousand years.

01:01.510 --> 01:03.043
I know I'm poor.

01:03.077 --> 01:03.744
I know I don't have much

01:03.778 --> 01:04.376
To offer,

01:04.412 --> 01:08.747
But I do love you.

01:08.781 --> 01:10.448
Because I'm beautiful?

01:10.482 --> 01:11.082
I don't love you,

01:14.386 --> 01:14.918
You're beautiful,

01:14.953 --> 01:16.684
Because I love you.

01:24.549 --> 01:26.516
What up with the disco?!

01:26.550 --> 01:27.250
I'm sorry.

01:27.284 --> 01:28.585
I hit the wrong thing.

01:28.619 --> 01:29.952
No, 15 years ago,

01:29.987 --> 01:31.020
Your mother gave birth

01:31.054 --> 01:33.689
To the wrong thing!

01:33.723 --> 01:34.223
All right,

01:34.257 --> 01:36.325
Why don't we take a break?

01:36.359 --> 01:37.860
Tori, Beck, you guys were great,

01:37.894 --> 01:38.994
Really nice stuff.

01:39.028 --> 01:40.129
Thanks.

01:40.163 --> 01:41.431
How was I?

01:41.465 --> 01:44.334
I've seen worse.

01:44.369 --> 01:45.035
Guys, guys,

01:45.069 --> 01:46.470
Everyone shut up a second.

01:46.504 --> 01:47.271
Whatcha got?

01:47.305 --> 01:47.772
An e-mail

01:47.806 --> 01:48.905
From principal eikner.

01:48.939 --> 01:52.309
That says?

01:52.343 --> 01:52.910

Oh, my God!

02:09.827 --> 02:11.094
Who's Sofia Michelle?

02:11.128 --> 02:15.698
Oh, no, no, no!

02:15.733 --> 02:16.766
What?

02:16.801 --> 02:17.801
She gets to be the lead

02:17.835 --> 02:18.535
And she doesn't even know

02:18.569 --> 02:20.403
Who Sofia Michelle is.

02:20.438 --> 02:21.671
Wait, is she the lady

02:21.706 --> 02:22.472
Who does those infomercials

02:22.506 --> 02:24.374
With the vibrating hairbrush?

02:24.408 --> 02:28.745
I love that hairbrush.

02:28.779 --> 02:29.279
Look at the cover

02:29.313 --> 02:31.646
Of your script.

02:31.681 --> 02:32.812

02:41.048 --> 02:42.046
All right, you guys,

02:42.081 --> 02:43.281
We knew we had to be great.

02:43.315 --> 02:44.915

02:44.949 --> 02:45.983
We are not gonna disappoint

02:46.017 --> 02:47.184

02:47.985 --> 02:50.286

02:50.321 --> 02:51.287
I'm good.

02:51.321 --> 02:53.389

02:53.423 --> 02:54.123
I have to go take another

02:54.157 --> 02:57.159
Nerve pill.

03:00.697 --> 03:02.931
Will you kill the disco?!

Oh, well, that is special,

04:32.108 --> 04:36.477

Oh, hey, Tori!

04:43.618 --> 04:44.584
With my assignment.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.018
Oh, what's the assignment?

04:46.053 --> 04:47.152
To transform a human face

04:47.187 --> 04:49.888
Into a terrifying monster.

04:49.922 --> 04:50.855
Wanna see?

04:50.889 --> 04:57.294
Terrify me.

04:57.328 --> 04:59.729
Isn't he scary?

04:59.763 --> 05:02.832
No, he's kind of adorable.

05:02.866 --> 05:05.968
Aw, man, you made me cute.

05:06.002 --> 05:08.003
You're the worst.

05:08.038 --> 05:08.771
Well, let me try again

05:08.805 --> 05:09.438
After school.

05:09.472 --> 05:10.005
No, no, no!

05:10.040 --> 05:11.640
I'm done with you.

05:11.674 --> 05:12.207
No, but wait,

05:12.241 --> 05:13.175
You can't just...

05:13.209 --> 05:15.142
Done with you.

05:15.177 --> 05:16.512
Oh, that's the third model

05:16.547 --> 05:17.313
Who's quit on me.

05:17.348 --> 05:20.620
I'm gonna get an "F" in makeup.

05:20.655 --> 05:21.421
Aww, that bites.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.556
Let's go get an "A" in lunch.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.624
Wait.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.325
No.

05:25.359 --> 05:25.792
I just need...

05:25.826 --> 05:26.492
I'm not gonna be your

05:26.527 --> 05:27.994
Monster makeup model.

05:28.028 --> 05:28.728
But if I don't transform

05:28.762 --> 05:29.329
Someone's face

05:29.363 --> 05:30.330
Into a hideous monster

05:30.364 --> 05:30.830
By Monday,

05:30.865 --> 05:32.065
I'm gonna fail this class.

05:32.099 --> 05:32.699
And if I don't cram

05:32.733 --> 05:33.333
A turkey sandwich

05:33.367 --> 05:33.800
Down my throat,

05:33.834 --> 05:34.300
I'm gonna fail

05:34.335 --> 05:35.769
Not starving to death.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.103
Oh, come on.

05:37.137 --> 05:37.970
We can do it tonight,

05:38.005 --> 05:38.437
Tomorrow night,

05:38.472 --> 05:39.305
Whenever you want.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.239
I'm in a huge play.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.339
I have to learn all my lines

05:41.372 --> 05:42.638
And five songs.

05:42.672 --> 05:43.638
Tori.

05:43.672 --> 05:44.172
Cat.

05:44.206 --> 05:44.805
Ah, you have to do it.

05:44.839 --> 05:45.538
No, I'm not doing it.

05:45.573 --> 05:46.672
Say yes, I'm desperate.

05:46.707 --> 05:47.240
I don't want to.

05:47.274 --> 05:48.174
All right, I'll do it.

05:49.910 --> 05:51.043
But you're buying my lunch.

06:05.522 --> 06:09.990
♪ Suddenly, my choice is clear... ♪

06:10.025 --> 06:10.891
Nice, now sing it

06:10.925 --> 06:12.592
Like an old jazz singer.

06:12.627 --> 06:13.359
Why?

06:13.394 --> 06:15.161
To amuse me.

06:19.764 --> 06:21.999
Clear.

06:22.867 --> 06:23.733
Come on, be a man.

06:26.836 --> 06:28.870
Now, I'm amused.

06:28.905 --> 06:29.671
Hey, it's almost 8:00.

06:29.705 --> 06:30.539
Are you getting hungry?

06:30.574 --> 06:31.475
Yeah, want me to go

06:31.509 --> 06:32.509
Pick up a pizza?

06:32.543 --> 06:32.976
Yeah, sure.

06:33.011 --> 06:33.977
Let's get a large pepperoni.

06:35.046 --> 06:40.254
Coming.

06:40.288 --> 06:42.492
Makeup time.

06:42.526 --> 06:44.227
Hey, Cat!

06:44.261 --> 06:45.328
Where should I set up?

06:45.362 --> 06:46.028
Kitchen table.

06:46.062 --> 06:49.531
Oh, I love kitchens.

06:49.565 --> 06:50.398
Hey, Andre.

06:50.433 --> 06:51.466
'Sup, little red?

06:51.500 --> 06:54.869
What's that supposed to mean?

06:54.903 --> 06:55.970
I don't know.

06:56.004 --> 06:57.238
Little red: You're little

06:57.272 --> 06:58.238
And you've got red hair?

06:58.273 --> 07:00.606
Oh, that's so creative.

07:00.641 --> 07:03.141
Do Tori now.

07:03.176 --> 07:03.842

07:10.382 --> 07:11.015
You wanna help me put

07:11.050 --> 07:12.483
Monster makeup on Tori's face?

07:12.517 --> 07:17.553
Bye.

07:17.587 --> 07:18.120
Maybe he had to use

07:18.154 --> 07:19.722
The bathroom.

07:19.757 --> 07:21.457
In my front yard?

07:21.492 --> 07:22.925
Well, sometimes my brother...

07:30.066 --> 07:36.235
Yep, show me, me.

Wow, look at me.

07:37.837 --> 07:39.771

07:39.805 --> 07:42.073
Oh, you really think so?

07:42.074 --> 07:42.974
Yeah, I totally look

07:43.009 --> 07:43.942
Like a zombie.

07:43.976 --> 07:46.109
Ay, I'm not a failure.

07:46.144 --> 07:46.911
Oh, hey, let's go scare

07:46.944 --> 07:47.444
My sister.

07:47.478 --> 07:49.046
Okay.

07:49.081 --> 07:51.681
Trina, come see something.

07:51.716 --> 07:54.217
Is it for me?

07:57.387 --> 07:58.620
Where's Tori?

07:58.654 --> 07:59.788
Ah, did they deliver

07:59.822 --> 08:02.356
My vibrating hairbrush?

08:07.662 --> 08:08.495
How could you not be scared

08:08.496 --> 08:09.229
By this?

08:09.264 --> 08:09.729
I've seen

08:09.764 --> 08:11.331
Our grandmother naked.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.499
Thing scares me anymore.

08:14.534 --> 08:14.900
Come on,

08:14.934 --> 08:15.600
Let me get some pics

08:15.635 --> 08:16.434
Of your face.

08:16.469 --> 08:17.102
'Kay.

08:17.136 --> 08:19.270
I want some apple juice.

08:19.305 --> 08:21.772
Then, go get some.

08:21.807 --> 08:25.743
Fine, I'll do it myself.

08:25.777 --> 08:26.710
Okay, come over here

08:26.745 --> 08:27.544
Into the light.

08:30.582 --> 08:33.917
Whoa-Rrr.

08:33.952 --> 08:36.385
What is this for?

08:36.419 --> 08:37.520
Oh, that's glue.

08:37.554 --> 08:38.721
Yeah, but why is it

08:38.755 --> 08:40.356
With your makeup supplies?

08:40.390 --> 08:41.557
What's the problem?

08:41.591 --> 08:42.758
This is grizzly glue.

08:42.792 --> 08:43.258
It's like an

08:43.293 --> 08:44.760
Industrial cement.

08:47.296 --> 08:48.897
Cat, tell me

08:48.931 --> 08:49.730
You didn't use this

08:49.765 --> 08:51.899
On Tori's face.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.404
Give me that.

08:57.438 --> 08:58.404
For industrial use only.

08:58.438 --> 08:59.637
Caution: Avoid contact

08:59.672 --> 09:00.271
With skin.

09:00.306 --> 09:00.671
Cat!

09:01.638 --> 09:02.972
Why didn't you use dermaglue?

09:03.006 --> 09:04.006
I ran out,

09:04.040 --> 09:04.573
So I got that out

09:04.607 --> 09:06.508
Of my dad's toolbox.

09:07.276 --> 09:08.409
Are you insane?!

09:08.444 --> 09:09.110
Will it come off?

09:09.711 --> 09:10.311
Why didn't you read

09:10.345 --> 09:10.911
The label?

09:10.946 --> 09:12.446
'Cause I t stcted

09:12.480 --> 09:12.946
By the picture

09:12.981 --> 09:15.749
Of the cute grizzly bear.

09:15.783 --> 09:16.516
I mean, look at him,

09:16.551 --> 09:17.250
He's like a fuzzy little...

09:17.618 --> 09:18.284
Hey!

09:26.092 --> 09:28.458
Ugh, this is not gonna work.

09:29.493 --> 09:29.993
You guys,

09:30.027 --> 09:30.726
I'm playing the lead

09:30.761 --> 09:31.860
In a big music tomrow night

09:31.895 --> 09:32.427
And my character

09:32.462 --> 09:33.962
Is supposed to be beautiful.

09:33.996 --> 09:34.962
Well, you do not

09:34.997 --> 09:37.564
Look beautiful.

09:37.965 --> 09:44.340
This is not gonna...

09:44.374 --> 09:45.975
Look, worse comes to worse,

09:46.009 --> 09:47.142
You postpone the play.

09:47.177 --> 09:48.143
No, I can't.

09:48.178 --> 09:49.010
Fimichelle is coming

09:49.045 --> 09:50.011
To see it.

09:50.012 --> 09:52.247
Oh, wow, that's so exciting.

09:52.281 --> 09:53.481
No, it's not.

09:53.515 --> 09:54.215
Why not?

09:54.249 --> 09:55.682
'Cause I'm a rotting zombie,

09:55.717 --> 09:56.983
At's why!

09:57.018 --> 09:58.417
I didn't mean to.

09:58.452 --> 09:59.618
Okay, all right.

09:59.653 --> 10:02.820
I got pizza.

10:12.093 --> 10:13.893
Right, it's on her skin.

10:13.928 --> 10:16.796
Yeah, grizzly glue.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.097
It won't come off.

10:18.131 --> 10:18.864
And my nose itches

10:18.898 --> 10:21.366
And I can't scratch it.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.367
Who are you talking to?

10:22.401 --> 10:23.434
The doctor, shh.

10:23.469 --> 10:24.368
Then who are you talking to?

10:24.403 --> 10:26.770
The glue company, shh.

10:26.805 --> 10:28.905
No, no, you don't understand,

10:28.940 --> 10:30.440
It's all over her face.

10:30.474 --> 10:31.308
Well, should I take her

10:31.342 --> 10:32.742
To the emergency room?

10:32.776 --> 10:33.709
I didn't read the label.

10:33.744 --> 10:35.778
Don't make me feel bad.

10:35.812 --> 10:37.546
Okay, I'll tell Tori.

10:37.580 --> 10:38.380
What? What? What?

10:38.415 --> 10:39.381
Listen,

10:39.415 --> 10:39.948
While I've got you

10:39.983 --> 10:41.349
On the phone, would I need

10:41.383 --> 10:42.683
My parents' permission to have

10:42.717 --> 10:44.184
Minor cosmetic surgery?

10:44.219 --> 10:47.220
Trina, hang up.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.055
I gotta go.

10:49.090 --> 10:50.090
What did he say?

10:50.124 --> 10:50.890
That I have to be 18

10:50.925 --> 10:51.457
Before he can make...

10:51.491 --> 10:53.125
About me!

10:53.159 --> 10:53.892
Can he get this zombie makeup

10:53.927 --> 10:54.760
Off my face?

10:54.794 --> 10:57.262
Oh, no.

10:58.231 --> 10:58.864
Well, did you tell him

10:58.898 --> 10:59.497
I'm starring in a play

10:59.532 --> 11:00.498
Tomorrow night that was written

11:00.533 --> 11:01.466
By Sofia Michelle,

11:01.500 --> 11:02.167
And that Sofia Michelle

11:02.201 --> 11:02.934
Is gonna be there

11:02.968 --> 11:03.935
And I'm supposed to be beautiful

11:03.969 --> 11:04.902
And not look like a walking

11:04.936 --> 11:05.669
De person who wants to eat

11:05.704 --> 11:07.638
People's brains?!

11:08.973 --> 11:10.640
Really? You do?

11:10.675 --> 11:11.208
They do?

11:11.242 --> 11:11.741
They do what?

11:11.776 --> 11:14.010
What they do?

11:14.044 --> 11:14.644
They make a solvent

11:14.678 --> 11:16.345
That's safe for skin.

11:16.379 --> 11:17.613
Well, where do we get it?

11:19.349 --> 11:20.782
Ask the man!

11:20.817 --> 11:22.717
It's a lady.

11:22.752 --> 11:24.952
Ask her.

11:24.987 --> 11:28.556
Hi, Gail, it's Cat, yeah.

11:28.590 --> 11:31.358
Where can I buy the solvent?

11:36.432 --> 11:42.103
Okay, bye.

11:42.438 --> 11:43.338
Well?

11:43.372 --> 11:44.038
Oh, they don't sell it

11:44.073 --> 11:45.406
In stores.

11:45.441 --> 11:46.307
But...well, then...

11:46.341 --> 11:47.040
We just have to drive

11:47.075 --> 11:47.840
To grizzly industries

11:47.875 --> 11:48.841
And get it there.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.841
Okay, so where's grizzly?

11:50.876 --> 11:51.609
Bakersfield.

11:51.642 --> 11:52.641
Bakersfield?

11:52.676 --> 11:53.375
Relax, that's only like

11:53.410 --> 11:54.008
Two hours from here.

11:54.043 --> 11:54.509
I could drive you

11:54.543 --> 11:55.343
There tomorrow.

11:55.377 --> 11:55.910
When?

11:55.944 --> 11:56.911
I have school until 3:00,

11:56.945 --> 11:57.911
And then I have final rehearsal

11:57.946 --> 11:59.146
And then I have to do the play.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.514
Calm down.

12:00.548 --> 12:02.115
After school, I'll go with Trina

12:02.149 --> 12:02.982
To bakersfield,

12:03.017 --> 12:04.584
Pick up the solvent, drive back,

12:04.618 --> 12:05.618
And get the makeup off your face

12:05.652 --> 12:07.419
Before the play starts.

12:07.454 --> 12:08.887
Okay, okay, that sounds...

12:09.956 --> 12:14.024
Augh, who's that?

12:14.059 --> 12:14.858
What?!

12:17.961 --> 12:30.704
Wait, I want cookies.

12:41.948 --> 12:43.983
5...6...7...8.

12:47.220 --> 12:48.954
That was dynamite,

12:48.988 --> 12:50.388
Except Robbie.

12:50.423 --> 12:50.889
Is something wrong

12:50.923 --> 12:53.024
With your pants?

12:53.058 --> 12:54.058
No, why?

12:54.093 --> 12:55.393
Was I dancing weird?

12:55.427 --> 12:58.428
No, it was great.

12:58.463 --> 12:58.895
Now, everyone,

12:58.930 --> 12:59.963
Go get some water,

12:59.997 --> 13:01.131
Hydrate and rest up

13:01.165 --> 13:02.465
For the show.

13:04.601 --> 13:05.467
Yeah, what's up?

13:05.502 --> 13:06.068
Your face.

13:06.102 --> 13:07.802
It's still hideous.

13:07.837 --> 13:08.870
I know, but my sister

13:08.904 --> 13:09.737
And Cat are already on their way

13:09.771 --> 13:10.738
Back here from bakersfield

13:10.772 --> 13:11.372
With the solvent.

13:11.406 --> 13:12.606
You're sure?

13:12.640 --> 13:15.441
Uh...totally, yes.

13:15.476 --> 13:17.410
All right.

13:29.723 --> 13:30.889
Trina, maybe you

13:30.924 --> 13:31.490
Should pull over

13:31.524 --> 13:32.091
If you're gonna put

13:32.125 --> 13:33.125
On lip gloss.

13:33.159 --> 13:35.994
Maybe you should talk less.

13:36.028 --> 13:36.628
That's what my dad

13:36.663 --> 13:38.697
Always says.

13:39.699 --> 13:42.400
Shut up!

13:42.435 --> 13:46.170
Yeah, I got a horn too, buddy!

13:48.241 --> 13:48.640
Oh, I think

13:48.675 --> 13:49.408
That's your phone.

13:49.442 --> 13:50.475
I know, find it.

13:52.377 --> 13:54.044
Come on, come on!

13:55.946 --> 13:57.280
Look under the seat.

13:57.314 --> 14:03.318
You're bossy.

14:03.352 --> 14:07.889
Ow, watch the girls.

14:07.923 --> 14:09.090
Found your phone.

14:09.124 --> 14:13.494
Then answer it.

14:13.528 --> 14:15.028
Hi, Trina's phone.

14:15.062 --> 14:15.695
Are you on your way back

14:15.730 --> 14:16.296
With the solvent?

14:16.330 --> 14:17.063
Tell me you're on the way back

14:18.398 --> 14:19.398
Who's calling?

14:19.433 --> 14:20.632
It's Tori.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.068
Oh, put her on speaker.

14:23.102 --> 14:24.302
Kay-Kay.

14:24.337 --> 14:25.904
Tori, you're on speaker.

14:25.938 --> 14:28.039
Trina is also in the car.

14:28.073 --> 14:29.140
Where are you guys?

14:29.174 --> 14:29.974
Relax, we're almost

14:30.008 --> 14:31.075
At the factory.

14:31.109 --> 14:31.609
The fact...

14:31.643 --> 14:32.510
You're not even there yet?

14:32.544 --> 14:33.110
The show starts

14:33.144 --> 14:34.278
In like two hours.

14:34.312 --> 14:35.479
We'll make it.

14:35.513 --> 14:37.815
Oh, punch buggy blue.

14:37.849 --> 14:39.283
Dude.

14:43.118 --> 14:43.951
Listen to me.

14:43.986 --> 14:44.685
If you two morons

14:44.720 --> 14:45.253
Aren't back here

14:45.287 --> 14:45.953
Before the play starts

14:45.988 --> 14:46.854
And I have to go on stage

14:46.889 --> 14:47.488
Looking like a zombie,

14:47.523 --> 14:48.022
I'm gonna punch

14:48.056 --> 14:48.756
Both your buggies.

14:48.790 --> 14:53.026
Do you...?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.026
I love you too, grandma.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.495
Thanks for the quilt.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.162
Quilt?

15:11.509 --> 15:12.442
Hi, Miss Michelle.

15:12.477 --> 15:13.610
I'm marty, the director.

15:13.644 --> 15:14.644
Pleasure to meet you.

15:14.679 --> 15:15.345
Sophia.

15:15.379 --> 15:20.116
Oh, I'm lane, big fan.

15:21.085 --> 15:21.584
Oh, my God,

15:21.619 --> 15:30.025
It's Sofia Michelle.

15:30.059 --> 15:30.859
Tori?

15:30.893 --> 15:31.493
I know, but they're

15:31.527 --> 15:32.794
Still not back with the solvent.

15:32.828 --> 15:33.428
Well, we're on

15:33.462 --> 15:33.995
In two minutes

15:34.029 --> 15:36.297
And you still look disgusting.

15:36.331 --> 15:37.498
I could play the lead.

15:37.532 --> 15:38.332
No, we don't have anyone else

15:38.366 --> 15:39.999
To play your part.

15:40.033 --> 15:40.865
We're indoors.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.899
Lose the scarf.

15:43.934 --> 15:44.800
Do something.

15:44.834 --> 15:46.534
But what do you want me...?

15:54.709 --> 15:55.776
Hi, Tori.

15:55.810 --> 15:56.343
Where are you?!

15:56.377 --> 15:57.911
Where's my solvent?!

15:57.945 --> 16:00.247
Ah, we have it right here.

16:00.281 --> 16:01.515
Put her on speaker.

16:07.018 --> 16:08.985
What's up sistah?

16:09.020 --> 16:09.753
The curtain's gonna be up

16:09.787 --> 16:10.553
In 90 seconds

16:10.588 --> 16:11.254
And I'm still freaky

16:11.288 --> 16:11.954
In the face.

16:11.989 --> 16:18.193
Why aren't you here?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.428
We had a little bit

16:19.462 --> 16:20.895
Of an emergency.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.231
What kind of emergency?

16:23.265 --> 16:26.233
A creamy delicious one?

16:26.267 --> 16:28.034
You stopped for ice cream?

16:28.069 --> 16:29.102
We had to.

16:29.136 --> 16:30.136
There was a freezy queen

16:30.170 --> 16:32.438
In bakersfield.

16:32.472 --> 16:33.539
Then how far away are you?

16:33.573 --> 16:35.273
Just like 40 minutes.

16:37.142 --> 16:38.242
You, in the red vehicle...

16:38.277 --> 16:40.544
Maybe an hour?

16:40.579 --> 16:41.512
Pull over to the side

16:41.546 --> 16:49.019
Of the road.

16:49.054 --> 16:50.788
So I'm on my private jet,

16:50.822 --> 16:52.757
Almost half way to barcelona,

16:52.791 --> 16:54.292
When I say to the pilot,

16:54.326 --> 16:55.359
I've changed my mind.

16:55.394 --> 16:56.127
Take a left.

16:56.161 --> 16:57.562
We're going to prague.

17:00.299 --> 17:01.165
You're too much.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.167
Aren't I?

17:04.203 --> 17:05.903
Hey, hey, hey, you there.

17:05.936 --> 17:06.671
Yes, sir?

17:06.704 --> 17:07.305
That luggage

17:07.339 --> 17:08.906
Is very expensive.

17:08.941 --> 17:10.275
Don't just toss it around

17:10.309 --> 17:12.377
Like a monkey.

17:13.078 --> 17:13.578
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

But most women

18:04.404 --> 18:05.437
Don't wannbe screamed at

18:05.471 --> 18:06.671
When they're being proposed to.

18:09.008 --> 18:10.775
I'm rich, I'm handsome,

18:10.810 --> 18:13.411
I have nine boats!

18:13.446 --> 18:16.514
Stop acting like a stupid girl!

18:16.548 --> 18:17.481
Wait, you got a little

18:17.516 --> 18:18.416
Something right there.

18:18.950 --> 18:19.683
This.

20:12.381 --> 20:15.516
We brought you freezy queen.

20:15.550 --> 20:16.083
Just get this muck

20:16.117 --> 20:16.884
Off my face.

20:17.719 --> 20:18.385
Get it off her face.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.053
Okay!

20:19.087 --> 20:19.653
Hurry.

20:31.127 --> 20:31.460
Now hurry,

20:31.494 --> 20:32.527
I'm missing the song.

20:40.234 --> 20:41.034
It's coming, it's coming,

20:41.068 --> 20:42.167
Be ready.

21:54.769 --> 21:56.771
Well, that was

21:56.806 --> 21:59.842
An interesting performance.

21:59.876 --> 22:00.810
When I wrote that play,

22:00.844 --> 22:02.178
I certainly never pictured

22:02.213 --> 22:04.114
Penny as a freakish zombie

22:04.149 --> 22:07.284
During most of it.

22:07.318 --> 22:10.219
Oh, man, I'm out of pills.

22:10.253 --> 22:11.053
Look, I can explain.

22:11.087 --> 22:12.888
You don't need to explain.

22:12.922 --> 22:15.023
I totally got it.

22:15.057 --> 22:16.291
You did?

22:16.325 --> 22:17.658
You do?

22:17.692 --> 22:19.192
She got it.

22:19.227 --> 22:21.094
What did you get?

22:21.128 --> 22:21.928
The whole commentary

22:21.962 --> 22:23.296
On what's really beautiful.

22:23.330 --> 22:24.933
Having these two young men

22:24.968 --> 22:26.370
Feel true love for a girl

22:26.404 --> 22:27.471
With a hideous face,

22:27.506 --> 22:28.172
Really emphasized

22:28.207 --> 22:29.340
The whole point of the play,

22:29.374 --> 22:31.976
Which is substance over beauty,

22:32.010 --> 22:33.845
The beauty within.

22:33.879 --> 22:36.280
Right.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.183
Well, we're really glad

22:39.218 --> 22:40.218
You liked it.

22:40.252 --> 22:41.452
Yeah, and did you enjoy

22:41.486 --> 22:43.587
My performance, Miss Michelle?

22:43.621 --> 22:44.321
Wow, I am late

22:44.355 --> 22:46.822
For my plane.

22:46.856 --> 22:47.222
We heard

22:47.256 --> 22:47.856
You were gonna be in L.A.

22:47.890 --> 22:48.790
All week.

22:48.824 --> 22:52.426
Right, well, bye.

22:52.927 --> 22:54.661
Congratulations everyone.

22:54.695 --> 22:55.661
Now, before we go,

22:55.696 --> 22:57.162
Just a couple of...

22:59.599 --> 23:01.447
Don't fight it.

23:21.134 --> 23:21.967
Me?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.134
I'm Beck.

23:23.169 --> 23:23.868
This?

23:23.903 --> 23:24.936
Is TheSlap.

23:24.970 --> 23:25.570
If you're gonna be

23:25.604 --> 23:26.771
Seriously angry,

23:26.805 --> 23:27.538
I won't get in a fight

23:27.572 --> 23:28.205
With you,

23:28.240 --> 23:29.806
But I will retaliate

23:29.841 --> 23:31.141
In a way that
I'll make you sad

23:31.175 --> 23:34.077
For a long time.

23:34.111 --> 23:35.077
You like that?

23:35.912 --> 23:36.879
