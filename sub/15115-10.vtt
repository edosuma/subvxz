WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.469
- but it's not quite done yet.
- I need to see it.

00:02.536 --> 00:04.905
I was going to put
on the finishing touches
and show you later.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.840
This is the finishing TOUCH:
My seeing what you've done

00:06.907 --> 00:09.109
- With my dance and then
swearing a lot.
- Okay fine.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.978
But you need to keep
an open mind.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.713
- I always have
an open mind.
- right.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.048
But you need to keep
an open mind like other people
keep an open mind.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.117
With a mind that's
actually, you know, open.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.186
How many times
have I told you
my production

00:19.253 --> 00:22.055
- of "the nutcracker" is
the highlight of my year?
- 842.

00:22.122 --> 00:25.058
And how many times
have I told you that
these two weeks of shows

00:25.125 --> 00:28.262
- Make up the bulk
of my money for the year?
- 12,064.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.231
- I gave you
one dance to choreograph.
- The evil rat dance, yes.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.065
- mice!
- What?

00:32.132 --> 00:34.034
- Mice, they're evil mice.
- No difference.

00:34.101 --> 00:37.137
- Big difference.
- Whatever. Anyhow,
it's done

00:37.204 --> 00:40.274
and it's great.
I just put my own
spin on it is all.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.910
Are they wearing pasties
and g-Strings?

00:42.976 --> 00:45.379
Ahh, see, funny--
Like I made them
vegas stripper rats.

00:45.445 --> 00:46.880
- Mice.
- whatever.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.248
No, I just
moderned it up a bit.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.017
Plus I needed someone
to stand in for Clara,

00:50.083 --> 00:52.519
since we still don't have
a Clara, so there's
a temp in there.

00:52.586 --> 00:56.223
Terrific. You can
dictate your resignation
letter to her afterwards.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.802

01:15.008 --> 01:17.177
Okay, make mama look good.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.650
You get it?

02:29.716 --> 02:33.120

wall street guys 'cause
wall street guys are... rats?

02:33.187 --> 02:35.422
- I get it.
- Do you like it?

02:39.393 --> 02:42.296
- I love it.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.101

Moo Shu pork.

Everything's down this year.

03:23.403 --> 03:27.307
Ticket sales, enrollments...
hopefully that fundraiser
you're organizing

03:27.374 --> 03:29.510
- Will make up the difference.
- Fundraiser?

03:29.576 --> 03:31.845
Yes, the fundraiser.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.314
The fundraiser
at the oyster bar.

03:34.381 --> 03:38.218
The one that
you said you'd plan,
that you had completely handled.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.052
- the one that--
- ( chuckles )

03:39.119 --> 03:42.055
- I hate you.
- <i>Everything's set--</i>

03:42.122 --> 03:44.057
Menu, decorations,
sound system.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.959
I got a weekend
at Catalina to raffle off,

03:46.026 --> 03:48.061
and I even got Rico
to donate the place for free.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.365
Speechless!

03:51.431 --> 03:53.967
- You're pretty proud
of yourself, aren't you?
- Yep.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.904
What would you say

03:56.970 --> 03:59.006
to running this place alone?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.040
For a while, anyway.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.644
Michael brought up Montana
again last night.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.346
He's talked about it
on and off for years.
I don't think he's ever

04:06.413 --> 04:09.550
been there for more than
a few days, But he has this
romantic notion about it.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.018
Anyhow, I was thinking

04:11.084 --> 04:13.754
since things are going
very smoothly around here...

04:13.820 --> 04:16.089
- since I've been around.
- ...I thought maybe
Michael and I

04:16.156 --> 04:19.193
could get away for a while.
I found this wonderful cabin--

04:19.259 --> 04:21.128
<i>Very rustic,</i>
<i>But completely comfortable.</i>

04:21.195 --> 04:24.231
I thought I could surprise him
and rent it for a couple,
three months.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.300
So romantic.
I'd be happy

04:26.366 --> 04:28.035
to take over while you
hang in the mountains
with your boyfriend.

04:28.101 --> 04:32.306
- Thank you.
- Which one of you is
going to be Heath ledger?

04:32.372 --> 04:35.542
You always
end the conversation
one sentence too late.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.044
- I'm here!
- <i>( bag drops )</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:39.546
- ( whispers ) Oh no!
- What?

04:39.613 --> 04:42.649
Oh crap!
I forgot all about her.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.852
- Who, the kid?
- That's no kid.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.688
- I'm ready!
- Okay, good!

04:47.754 --> 04:48.121
Ready for what?

04:53.026 --> 04:55.696
Whoa-- Holy crap.
Who is she?

04:55.762 --> 04:57.598
- The Ringer.
- What?

04:57.664 --> 05:00.601
When Sasha quit
and I couldn't find
anyone else I got desperate

05:00.667 --> 05:03.537
and I called the Ringer.
I had her shipped down
from San Francisco.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.539
- <i>What's her name?</i>
- <i>I don't know her name.</i>

05:05.606 --> 05:08.175
<i>She's always</i>
<i>just been called the Ringer.</i>
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

05:08.242 --> 05:10.844
- Fanny, you have to tell her
Sasha's back.
- I know I do.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.982
- Jiminy cricket!
- She's terrifying.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.217
If Marvel comics had
a crime-Fighting ballerina,

05:17.284 --> 05:19.186
this ballerina would kick
that ballerina's ass.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.589
You're talking.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.092
- No, no one's--
- She's talking.
I'm watching.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.127
I'm not talking.
I'm not talking!

05:27.194 --> 05:29.329
why don't you take
a break for a second?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.543
Good luck, cowboy.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.978
Wait!

05:45.045 --> 05:47.080
Break's over.

06:00.761 --> 06:04.631
- What is that?
- Sophia: I don't know,
but I'm learning to type.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.001
You don't think
madame Fanny actually...

06:14.741 --> 06:17.511
great.
Very mature.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.314
Hey, what is the what?
I'm starving.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.884
- Where do you guys
stash the Candy bars?
- Dancers don't eat Candy bars.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.019
Yeah right.
Suzanne Farrell
was 60% caramel.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.589
Can we help you
with something?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.023
I just came up to check
the state of the room,

06:30.090 --> 06:33.093
make sure
it's still pink.
It is.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.300
- What's going on here?
- Apparently while I was off
making with the pom-Poms

06:40.367 --> 06:43.504
some sort of blood feud
happened and no one seems
ready to let it go

06:43.570 --> 06:45.772
( loudly )
No matter how Boring
it's getting!

06:45.839 --> 06:48.542
Huh.
Anything I can help with?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.446
Okay, you four,
front and center.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.046
Why me?
I'm not in a fight.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.617
You need a fourth.
Watch "the craft." Move.

Boo likes Charlie,
Charlie likes Ginny,

07:15.335 --> 07:18.038
Melanie says Ginny can't
date Charlie because boo
liked him first,

07:18.105 --> 07:20.040
but Ginny thinks
since Boo likes Carl
she relinquishes Charlie,

07:20.107 --> 07:24.545
who should revert back
to the open market. And me,
I wish we were all lesbians.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.247
Wow, okay, uh... Ginny,
you like Charlie.

07:27.314 --> 07:30.217
- and he likes me.
- And, Melanie, you think
she shouldn't date him?

07:30.284 --> 07:32.653
- Boo has dibs.
- So you like him for boo?

07:32.719 --> 07:35.756
- I don't like him for anyone.
- But if boo wants Carl

07:35.822 --> 07:38.358
and is okay with Ginny
dating Charlie,

07:38.425 --> 07:41.195
could you find a way
to possibly to be okay
with it at all?

07:41.261 --> 07:44.131
The alterative being you might
lose a really perky friend.

07:44.198 --> 07:46.433
- I'll deal.
- Really?

07:46.500 --> 07:49.903
On the condition that I never
have to hear anything
about Charlie-- Ever.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.906
Nothing about his hair
or his car or his creepy
chicken hands.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.309
I promise.
I won't talk to you
about Charlie at all.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.044
- fine.
- Boo?

07:57.110 --> 08:00.047
- Charlie doesn't like me.
- not the point.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.116
- the point is that...
- I like Carl.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.119
- Yes. So...?
- It's fine.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.021
- You dating Charlie is fine.
- Good give.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.425
Now what are you gonna
do for her, blondie?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.060
- No more short-Carl jokes--
From either of us.
- What?!

08:13.126 --> 08:16.029
we will be completely nice
to him and we'll help you
get him back.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.433
C'mon!
I haven't called him
bilbo baggins yet!

08:19.499 --> 08:20.968
- Michelle: <i>Melanie!</i>
- Fine.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.770
Well handled.
Okay, uh, gum wrapper.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.007
Okay, everyone write
your name on This very
official document

08:27.074 --> 08:30.377
and consider
the first official

08:30.444 --> 08:32.045

You see what I did there?
I kofi annan-Ed their Butts.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.189
Very impressive.
Who's the Spinner?

08:42.256 --> 08:45.526
<i>Oh wow.</i>
<i>Where did she come from?</i>

08:45.592 --> 08:49.263
Oh, I have no idea
who that might be.
Huh, that's weird.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.039
- Madame Fanny?
- Sasha!

08:59.106 --> 09:02.276
Goodness, I didn't
hear you come in.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.044
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Who is that?

09:04.111 --> 09:06.647
- Who?
- her.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.016
The person dancing nonstop
in the middle of the floor.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.218
Oh her.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.353
- Well, that's--
- Did you call in the Ringer?

09:13.420 --> 09:15.022
I did! I'm sorry,
I didn't know
what else to do.

09:15.088 --> 09:19.259
- Is she going to be Clara?
- No, you are Clara.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.529
Well, is somebody going
to tell music-Box ballerina
over there?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.097
Yes, of course.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.367
I mean, it's too late
to send her back now.
Arrangements have been made.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.169
She'll be here
at least a week.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.038
I'll just give her
a different role.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.039
I wonder how
she'll feel about that.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.008
I don't know.
Do machines feel?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.311
- You tell her!
- What?

09:37.377 --> 09:40.147
Yes! As part
of your punishment,
you have to go over there

09:40.214 --> 09:42.883
- And tell her
she's not playing Clara.
- Are you afraid of her?

09:42.950 --> 09:45.853
No, I'm not
afraid of her.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.723
This is a life lesson.
Your behavior got us
into this situation,

09:49.790 --> 09:51.091
so your behavior should
get us out of it.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.330
- fine.
- Wait!

10:00.868 --> 10:03.504
Go!

10:06.974 --> 10:09.710
Hey.
I'm Sasha.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.546
Wow, your shoes
should be red.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.015
I wrap my feet
in cellophane so the blood
doesn't soak through.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.050
No, I didn't mean like--
Never mind.

10:17.117 --> 10:21.054
So there's been
a little mistake.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.990
You were
called down here to--

10:23.056 --> 10:25.392
To play Clara?
I know. I'm ready.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.428
Yeah well, you were
supposed to replace me,

10:28.495 --> 10:30.097
but now I'm back,
so you don't need to.

10:33.267 --> 10:35.636
- anymore.
- Replace you?

10:35.702 --> 10:37.037
- Yeah.
- Where were you?

10:37.104 --> 10:40.908
I, uh, quit ballet
for a while.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.110
- to do what?
- To...

10:43.177 --> 10:45.012
be a cheerleader.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.414
Oh!

10:48.949 --> 10:51.351
Yeah, so thanks
for coming,

10:51.418 --> 10:54.421
- But Bye!
- You know, I've seen
your kind before.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.691
You get into ballet
for the tutus.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.227
I did not get into ballet
for the tutus.

11:00.294 --> 11:02.029
But then you get older
and suddenly there's boys

11:02.095 --> 11:05.966
and clothes and...
cheerleading.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.035
Yeah Well, whatever,
I'm here now,

11:08.101 --> 11:12.272
- So I'm not going anywhere.
- We'll see.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.042
Look, madame Fanny
said she'd give you another
part to play if you--

11:15.108 --> 11:18.946
Could you stop dancing
for one freaking moment?!

11:19.012 --> 11:21.248
I'll stop dancing.
I'll stop dancing

11:21.315 --> 11:23.050
after I take my bow
in "the nutcracker"...

11:23.116 --> 11:25.752
as Clara.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.498
Hey, Rico,
your place looks great.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.901
Yeah, there's a lot
of freaking people in here.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.403
- I know. Great turnout.
- I mean they're everywhere.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.106
- They're using the bathrooms.
- That was part of the
ticket price--

11:46.173 --> 11:48.942
- Food, drinks, working toilets.
- But how long are they
going to stay?

11:49.009 --> 11:51.945
- the party's till 10:00.
- 10:00? That's like
four hours from now.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.547
- Who agreed to this?
- You did!

11:53.614 --> 11:55.849
Oh, what the frak!

11:55.916 --> 11:58.852
- Are you paying me a lot?
- You donated the place.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.388
- Yeah, that sounds like me.
- Have a drink.

12:01.455 --> 12:04.958
It will all
look better after a drink.
China, set him up good.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.861
- <i>You got it.</i>
- Ginny: Thanks so much
for coming.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.830
Melanie:
See you at the show!

12:09.897 --> 12:12.366
Okay, whose gross hand
do we have to shake next?

12:12.432 --> 12:13.800
I say we wait
a few minutes

12:13.867 --> 12:16.970
and let the four
different kinds of bird flu
sink into our pores

12:17.037 --> 12:19.306
before we go for
the malaria-Ebola trifecta.

12:19.373 --> 12:22.209
- I want to live in a bubble.
- Hey, don't look too closely,

12:22.276 --> 12:25.279
- But old man Purdee left
his fly unzipped again.
- ugh, I know.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.715
- I was looking for Carl.
- I think I saw him
under the sink.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.220
- Melanie, wrapper!
- That wasn't a short joke.

12:33.287 --> 12:34.855
He was literally
under the sink.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.590
He must've dropped
something.

12:36.657 --> 12:38.859
I didn't say he was
living under the sink, god.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.729
Stop following me.
I'm not Justin Bieber!

12:42.796 --> 12:43.864
Who?

12:43.931 --> 12:46.867
- Seriously?
- What if something happens?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.902
What if you get
abducted by aliens?

12:48.969 --> 12:52.272
What if some guy grabs you
on the sidewalk and throws
you in the back of a Van?

12:52.339 --> 12:54.708
- then I'd hope
you'd call the police.
- of course.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.577
After rehearsal.

12:57.578 --> 13:00.013
- Hey, Carl!
- Hey.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.349
- So many people here tonight.
- Love those boots.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.117
- Digging the hat.
- Okay?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.253
- You have any plans
for the summer?
- Camp.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.422
- S'mores!
- Awesome.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.891
Yeah, I'm going
to go now.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.026
Okay.
Bye, Carl.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.429
You're way taller
than Prince.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.365
- That was hard.
- I think I actually
pulled something.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.970
What?
Did the pizza bites
finally come out?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.606
<i>What are they</i>
<i>doing here, Ginny?</i>

13:25.672 --> 13:27.808
I mentioned
the fundraiser to Charlie
in one of our texts.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.676
I didn't know
you two were texting.

13:29.743 --> 13:31.812
We agreed
I wasn't going to talk
about Charlie to you.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.547
Gum wrapper, remember?

13:33.614 --> 13:37.117
Hey, Ginny, you look cute.
Who's the dude you're with?

13:37.184 --> 13:39.920
Very funny.
It's nice you bring
your wife everywhere.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.923
You wanna maybe go
somewhere where the scenery
is less revolting?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.958
- Um, sure.
- Cool.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.593
Later.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.363
I have to hand it to her,
Michelle really came through.

13:49.429 --> 13:53.133
- Look at all these people.
- You mean look at all of these
walking dollar signs.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.969
- Oh, Michael... but yes.
- ( laughs )

13:56.036 --> 13:59.239
So I don't want to say
I totally delivered, but...

14:00.974 --> 14:03.443
- But what?
- You're supposed to say
"you totally did."

14:03.510 --> 14:06.313
I am? I'm supposed
to say "Totally"?

14:06.380 --> 14:08.882
- I don't think so.
- Why won't she give me
my props?

14:08.949 --> 14:12.319
Just five minutes ago
she was saying that
you really came through.

14:12.386 --> 14:14.188
- You're kidding.
- don't tell her that.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.824
- Wait, what else did she say?
- She said that you were going
to be over here

14:17.891 --> 14:21.895
fishing for compliments,
but I said that you were
too good for that.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.033
- Never mind.
- <i>( both laughing )</i>

14:28.869 --> 14:31.138
Be right back.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.907
Don't do it.
The answer's never
in a citrus slice.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.043
Have a shot instead.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.378
I'm an idiot.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.348
Put that comment
into context before
I form a response.

14:41.415 --> 14:43.984
I totally blew it
with Carl.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.653
I didn't even realize
I liked him until
he was gone.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.589
Well, he didn't go far.
He's over there.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.525
Might as well be
in singapore, he's never
coming near me again.

14:51.592 --> 14:53.961
- You hurt his feelings, boo.
- I know.

14:54.027 --> 14:57.798
You did the damage,
now you have to
make it right.

14:57.865 --> 15:00.968
So get up and go
make it right.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.013
- What did you do?
- Just spreading
the yoda around.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.848
Oh my god.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.518
- is this on?
- Try the Veal!

15:17.584 --> 15:20.487
- What?
- Never mind.
Go on. Yay, boo.

15:20.554 --> 15:22.656
( crowd cheering )

15:22.723 --> 15:24.358
Thank you.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.394
Um, I'd like to take this
opportunity

15:27.461 --> 15:29.396
to say something

15:29.463 --> 15:31.064
here

15:31.131 --> 15:33.734
in front
of a lot of people.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.670
It's humiliating
and I deserve to be humiliated.

15:36.737 --> 15:39.673
- Wow, this kid
should be a nun.
- Carl?

15:39.740 --> 15:44.011
I like you. You're great
and I think you're hot.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.614
- Never mind.
- and I am such a dope,

15:47.681 --> 15:50.117
a big stupid
slobbering moron.

15:50.184 --> 15:52.653
- This was your advice?
- I didn't write it out for her.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.821
I know tonight isn't
about you and me--

15:54.888 --> 15:58.058
Not that there is a you and me.
But if there was a you and me,

15:58.125 --> 16:01.228
tonight would definitely not be
the night to discuss it, here,

16:01.295 --> 16:04.998
- Or any public place probably.
- Get in there and save her.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.601
- I'm going.
- <i>But you put it all</i>
<i>out there for me once</i>

16:07.668 --> 16:09.903
- And now it's my turn.
- <i>( "Rainbow connection"</i>
<i>Playing )</i>

16:09.970 --> 16:12.840
You're amazing
and you liked me.

16:12.906 --> 16:15.976
And I was lucky
and I didn't realize that.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.779
And I was stupid
and I'm sorry

16:18.846 --> 16:21.648
- And I will be sorry
forever.
- Sit.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.318
- Sitting.
- I don't expect you
to forgive me,

16:24.384 --> 16:27.221
but if you ever
decided that

16:27.287 --> 16:29.156
you want Ginger
around again,

16:29.223 --> 16:31.892
I'm here, Fred.
Thank you.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.394
Crowd: Awww.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.502
- Hi.
- Wow.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.804
You talked about me
like I'm Ryan gosling.

16:43.871 --> 16:46.406
Well, that's how
I feel, so...

16:46.473 --> 16:51.778
- Should we take that dance?

that was very impressive.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.933
FANNY:
God, this thing won't end.
What time is it?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.802
9:15.
Someone's suddenly crabby.

18:21.869 --> 18:25.041
- I'm tired.
- You're never tired.

18:27.610 --> 18:30.446
- Montana was for him,
not us.
- What?

18:30.513 --> 18:33.149
All that talk about Montana
was just for him.

18:33.216 --> 18:36.686
It had nothing to do with me.
He bought a piece of land there.

18:36.753 --> 18:39.255
Already paid for it.
He's going to build a house.

18:39.322 --> 18:41.958
What a man who's Only lived
in hotels his entire adult life

18:42.025 --> 18:44.994
knows about building
a house is beyond me,
but there it is.

18:45.061 --> 18:46.729
Did you tell him
about the cabin?

18:46.796 --> 18:49.098
- The cabin doesn't matter now.
- But did you talk to him?

18:49.165 --> 18:50.833
Does he understand
how you feel?

18:50.900 --> 18:53.636
All these years he's never
owned a house, a car.

18:53.703 --> 18:57.640
He even rented his tux to play
for gigs-- Said he didn't
want to have "Things."

18:57.707 --> 19:00.743
Now he wants "Things."
Things in Montana.

19:00.810 --> 19:02.545
Oh, Fanny.

19:02.612 --> 19:05.515
Well, there's nothing
I can do about it.

19:05.581 --> 19:08.251
I have guests here.
I have the school
to think about.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.453
- But--
- I'm going to make
the rounds.

19:13.756 --> 19:16.326
So should we date?

19:16.392 --> 19:18.094
- What?!
- Well--

19:18.161 --> 19:21.564
Hell freezes over,
I'd buy a sweater.
I do not date you.

19:21.631 --> 19:24.167
Hey, I don't want
to date you either.
I just thought,

19:24.233 --> 19:27.737
with Charlie dating Ginny,
don't we have to, too?

19:27.804 --> 19:29.906
Oh my God.

19:29.973 --> 19:33.142
It's just easier!
There's Only so much
room in the car!

19:33.209 --> 19:35.244
- I'm leaving.
- Oh, is it late?
What time is it?

19:35.311 --> 19:38.948
It's half past I'm-Not-
Sitting-at-that-Table-
With-That-Loser-Anymore.

19:39.015 --> 19:40.450
- Bye.
- Wait, I'll come with you!

19:40.516 --> 19:42.585
- No!
- I have to go.

19:42.652 --> 19:45.121
- Really?
- Yeah, she-- Anyhow.

19:47.090 --> 19:49.625
It was really nice
that you came tonight.

19:49.692 --> 19:52.028
Uh, sure, so...

19:54.664 --> 19:56.399
- Ow!
- Are you okay?

19:56.466 --> 19:59.569
- Crap, I'm bleeding!
- I think that's my blood
actually.

19:59.635 --> 20:01.771
- My lip is split.
- I'm sorry. Can I see?

20:01.838 --> 20:04.440
No no, I'm fine.
I'll see you later.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.275
Let's bail.

20:06.342 --> 20:09.479
- Michael.
- You are intelligent,

20:09.545 --> 20:12.415
very thin and you have
excellent hair.

20:12.482 --> 20:14.283
Can I talk to you a sec?

20:14.350 --> 20:16.986
That sounds serious.
Should I order
another drink?

20:17.053 --> 20:19.822
- It's about Montana.
- What do you know
about Montana?

20:19.889 --> 20:22.992
- I know you
bought some land there.
- Five acres, not a lot,

20:23.059 --> 20:26.996
but enough to build a house
and maybe a recording
studio out back.

20:27.063 --> 20:29.532
- Sounds like
it's going to be great.
- One snowstorm

20:29.599 --> 20:32.769
and we could be talking
about the last 15 minutes
of "the shining."

20:32.835 --> 20:35.705
But I'm hoping
for the best.

20:35.772 --> 20:38.041
And Fanny?

20:38.107 --> 20:40.576
- What about Fanny?
- Does she get to be
your Shelley Duvall?

20:40.643 --> 20:43.046
Does she want to be
my Shelley Duvall?

20:43.112 --> 20:46.616
- Well, I didn't actually mean--
- Did you see "the shining"?

20:46.683 --> 20:49.085
- I was trying to be thematic.
- He comes after her
with an axe!

20:49.152 --> 20:51.120
Forget Shelley Duvall.
It's just in the past,

20:51.187 --> 20:54.123
when you talked about Montana,
Fanny was under the impression

20:54.190 --> 20:56.159
that it was
for both of you.

20:56.225 --> 20:59.796
Fanny in Montana?
Come on.

20:59.862 --> 21:02.265
No, I'm serious.
She actually went out

21:02.332 --> 21:05.034
and found a cabin to rent
for the two of you this summer.

21:05.101 --> 21:07.904
I was going to
take over the dance studio.

21:07.971 --> 21:09.939
She was going
to surprise you.

21:12.442 --> 21:14.844
Well... I'm surprised.

21:14.911 --> 21:17.814
I think she figured
since you weren't going
to be on the road so much,

21:17.880 --> 21:21.150
that you guys could
finally really be together.

21:21.217 --> 21:24.620
I know This is none
of my business

21:24.687 --> 21:27.056
but I thought you should know.
Fanny's so stubborn.

21:27.123 --> 21:30.360
- I understand.
- You do?

21:30.426 --> 21:32.862
- And I appreciate
the information.
- Good.

21:32.929 --> 21:35.264
Okay good.

21:35.331 --> 21:36.733
Can I buy you a drink?

21:36.799 --> 21:39.435
All the proceeds go
to keeping ballerinas
in bunion pads.

21:39.502 --> 21:42.038
Sure. You order.
I'm going to go
make a call.

21:42.105 --> 21:44.874
Cellphone service
in here's not so good.

21:44.941 --> 21:47.844
- Okay.
China, two more!
- <i>Sure thing.</i>

21:49.846 --> 21:51.648
- Hey!
- Whoa. Sorry.

21:51.714 --> 21:53.850
- that's my hiding place.
- who are you hiding from?

21:53.916 --> 21:55.885
- The toe-Shoe terminator.
- Who?

21:55.952 --> 21:57.987
Crazy Chick wants my part
in "the nutcracker."

21:58.054 --> 22:00.790
She's mental, she's lethal
and she's pirouetting
around here somewhere.

22:00.857 --> 22:02.892
- Hey, I know you.
- No.

22:02.959 --> 22:06.029
- You're on
the cheerleading squad.
- Oh yeah, I was.

22:06.095 --> 22:08.965
I'm Tyler.
I'm on the basketball team.

22:09.032 --> 22:11.934
- I've seen you at games.
- Ah Well, hell of a season
you're having.

22:12.001 --> 22:14.804
- We're 0 and 12.
- Consistency is everything.

22:14.871 --> 22:17.240
So you're not cheering
anymore?

22:17.307 --> 22:19.575
As soon as I realized "Victory"
and their first NAMES

22:19.642 --> 22:21.978
were all
they could actually spell,
I was outta there.

22:22.045 --> 22:23.880
- Not your crowd?
- Not at all.

22:27.050 --> 22:29.652
- Well, I should
get back to work.
- Bye.

22:29.719 --> 22:31.888
See you.

22:31.954 --> 22:33.389
- Wait!
- Yeah?

22:33.456 --> 22:35.725
- You mind?
- Oh. Sure.

22:45.101 --> 22:48.204
- "in-a-gadda-Da-Vida"?
- "wake me up before you go-Go."

22:48.271 --> 22:50.039
Oh, so close.

22:50.106 --> 22:53.643
- Same shorts. New shirt?
- Same shirt. Inside out.

22:53.710 --> 22:56.813
- Wow, very Kate Middleton.
- She is my primary role model.

22:56.879 --> 22:59.649
- Why are you
hanging out at this thing?
- I thought you'd be here.

22:59.716 --> 23:01.884
Straight to the point.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.953
No fancy Coy talk,
no clever banter.

23:04.020 --> 23:06.889
I'm going to australia
next week so I gotta
move things along.

23:06.956 --> 23:09.959
- What are you going
to do in australia?
- Don't know.

23:10.026 --> 23:11.828
- How long are you
gonna be there?
- Not a clue.

23:11.894 --> 23:13.863
- You ever put a shrimp
on the Barbie?
- Once,

23:13.930 --> 23:15.465
but it was on
an actual girl
named Barbie.

23:15.531 --> 23:18.634
- I don't think I want
a further explanation.
- Good.

23:25.008 --> 23:27.377
I don't know if this is
the night for this.

23:30.813 --> 23:33.149
Or maybe I'm wrong.

23:36.886 --> 23:38.888
<i>( music playing )</i>

24:06.916 --> 24:10.887
- <i>( music stops )</i>
- Oh my god, stop! I give!

24:10.953 --> 24:14.691
- What?
- That is the most Boring duet
in the history of duets.

24:14.757 --> 24:17.293
I have never been
able to stand it, ever.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.697
It just goes on and on
with that annoying
monotonous music.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.666
I can't do it.
It's cut. I'm cutting it
out of the ballet.

24:23.733 --> 24:26.436
And the dance world
hoists me up
on their shoulders.

24:26.502 --> 24:29.238
- What about my solo?
- Oh.

24:29.305 --> 24:32.208
Right.
Do the "Chinese dance."

24:37.981 --> 24:39.849
Stop single-White-
Female-Ing me!

24:39.916 --> 24:41.584
I don't know
what that means.

24:41.651 --> 24:43.953
- It's a movie.
- a cheerleader and a moviegoer.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.855
And then Charlie
bent down as I went up

24:45.922 --> 24:49.225
and of course you can
guess what happened--
Bang! Total collision.

24:49.292 --> 24:51.794
- Ginny.
- What? Did you hear?

24:51.861 --> 24:53.963
I'm sorry.
I wasn't telling you.
I was telling matisse.

24:54.030 --> 24:57.166
- Yeah, I need to get
to the rosin.
- Oh sorry.

24:57.233 --> 24:59.502
- Good?
- Terrific.

24:59.569 --> 25:02.372
( whispering )
The bottom line is
he would have kissed me.

25:02.438 --> 25:05.041
I hope his teeth are okay.
They seemed really strong.

25:05.108 --> 25:08.478
They actually left
a mark here in my scalp.
See? Is it still there?

25:17.253 --> 25:19.022
That boo is good.

25:19.088 --> 25:21.324
She is good.

25:21.391 --> 25:24.761
Have you ever
put ground glass
in your rival's toe shoe?

25:26.396 --> 25:29.265
- No.
- huh.

25:33.069 --> 25:35.772
<i>( music playing )</i>

25:48.017 --> 25:51.387
- <i>( music stops )</i>
- Well, it's official.

25:51.454 --> 25:54.824
The only thing more Boring
than the "arabian dance"
is the "Chinese dance."

25:54.891 --> 25:56.959
It's cut.
Out of the ballet.

25:57.026 --> 26:00.863
- What can you do that's not
going to put me to sleep?
- The "spanish Dance"?

26:00.930 --> 26:03.666
doesn't sound promising,
but sure, do that.

26:03.733 --> 26:06.636
Boo!
Tiny fan please.

26:10.673 --> 26:13.109
Is everything okay,
madame Fanny?

26:13.176 --> 26:14.911
In what sense?

26:14.978 --> 26:17.413
You seem like
you're in a bad mood.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.749
My mood is fine!

26:22.385 --> 26:24.554
Really?!

26:24.620 --> 26:27.857
maybe it's too soon
to think about prom since
it's still a couple years off,

26:27.924 --> 26:31.694
but forming a perfect
prom-Night potential-Sex
contingency plan takes time.

26:31.761 --> 26:33.596
It's a delicate matter.
Now assuming

26:33.663 --> 26:35.865
we haven't consummated
the relationship yet,

26:35.932 --> 26:38.234
a gentle but definitive
"No" message

26:38.301 --> 26:41.504
has to be delivered in a way
that doesn't make him feel
like less of a man.

26:41.571 --> 26:43.906
However, if the deed
has been done already,
then you have to make sure

26:43.973 --> 26:46.542
he doesn't take you
to a cheap dump just because
you've already given it up.

26:46.609 --> 26:48.945
- You know
I'm only 12, right?
- Oh.

26:49.012 --> 26:52.749
Yeah, so this whole talk
is completely inappropriate.

26:52.815 --> 26:55.852
- Sorry. Did you hear?
- It's fine.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.021
No, I promised not
to talk about...

26:58.087 --> 27:01.958
the person I'm not
supposed to talk about, so I'm
not going to talk about that...

27:02.025 --> 27:04.093
person.

27:06.029 --> 27:08.765
( chatting )

27:10.633 --> 27:12.902
- I think I'm going
to walk home.
- Ginny.

27:20.476 --> 27:22.145
As soon as the guys are done,
you can open the house.

27:22.211 --> 27:24.280
How is it? Fixed?
Perfect, that's all
I want to hear.

27:24.347 --> 27:26.916
- Michelle: <i>Okay, just don't</i>
<i>sweat and you'll be fine.</i>
- Girl: <i>Thank you.</i>

27:26.983 --> 27:30.153
- Place looks great.
- Fanny: <i>The air conditioners</i>
<i>are being difficult.</i>

27:30.219 --> 27:32.255
- The guys will fix it.
- I'm too old for this crap.

27:32.322 --> 27:34.123
- Yes, you are.
- What does that mean?

27:34.190 --> 27:36.292
It means you need
to sit down and let me
fix your lashes.

27:36.359 --> 27:39.228
My lashes?
What's wrong with my lashes?

27:39.295 --> 27:42.332
My God.
My lashes are crooked.

27:42.398 --> 27:45.735
I've been walking around
with my lashes completely
crooked for an hour

27:45.802 --> 27:49.205
- And no one says a thing.
- Yes, where's a nice drag queen
when you need one? Sit.

27:49.272 --> 27:52.241
- Okay.
- my god.

27:52.308 --> 27:54.544
Are you fleeing
the country after the show?

27:54.610 --> 27:57.046
It's my zombie-Apocalypse
vegas slut bag.

27:57.113 --> 27:59.148
I take it to every
performance with me always.

27:59.215 --> 28:01.751
It has everything
you would need in any
sort of situation--

28:01.818 --> 28:04.120
Money, power bars,
water, flaxseed oil,

28:04.187 --> 28:06.656
Bobby pins, hair spray,
ponytail holders,

28:06.723 --> 28:11.394
boob tape so your--
on your boobs, don't
look so ♪ hello. ♪

28:11.461 --> 28:14.897
- I know what boob tape does.
- ...condoms, handcuffs,
handcuff keys.

28:14.964 --> 28:18.434
- You're like
an x-Rated Mary poppins.
- Then of course band-Aids,

28:18.501 --> 28:21.638
ace bandage,
rape whistle,
disposable cellphone,

28:21.704 --> 28:25.108
lipstick case you can
hide some cyanide in,
pretty Mace...

28:25.174 --> 28:28.277
- Pretty Mace?
- Yep, Mace that comes in
a pretty little shiny bottle

28:28.344 --> 28:31.180
that if I pulled it out
would say to the zombie
apocalypse mugger,

28:31.247 --> 28:34.584
"don't be afraid of my pretty
shiny bottle. It won't do
anything But blind you!"

28:34.651 --> 28:38.021
- Good lord.
- Oh and here, eyelash glue.
And junior mints.

28:38.087 --> 28:41.557
- 'cause seriously, why not?
- Fix my lashes before you go
back into that bag again.

28:41.624 --> 28:43.259
Lean back.

28:45.628 --> 28:48.097
There.
Now just sit quiet while
I recite the contents

28:48.164 --> 28:51.200
of my "Following u2,
where the streets have
no name, I love you Bono" bag.

28:51.267 --> 28:54.203
Bye-Bye.
I'm opening the house!

28:54.270 --> 28:56.773
15 minutes to curtain!

28:56.839 --> 28:59.342
Fanny! the show's
going to be great.

29:06.015 --> 29:08.618
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

29:08.685 --> 29:11.120
Fine.
I hope you don't mess up
our trio tonight.

29:11.187 --> 29:13.323
- I won't.
- You don't jump on three.
You jump on four.

29:13.389 --> 29:16.192
- I know.
- There's a difference
between knowing and doing.

29:16.259 --> 29:19.195
How about this: I promise
to jump on four if you promise
to bite me on three?

29:19.262 --> 29:21.397
- Very constructive.
- I'm nothing if not helpful.

29:21.464 --> 29:24.867
- Do whatever you want.
- I want to just screw the whole
dance up for you and everyone.

29:24.934 --> 29:26.969
- fine.
- great.

29:29.339 --> 29:32.008
The truce is off.
Trash the wrapper.

29:36.980 --> 29:39.282
Look who's wearing
the bow now.

29:39.349 --> 29:41.317
I do believe it's me.

29:48.691 --> 29:50.193
At least
I have a name.

29:50.259 --> 29:52.195
You ruined everything
with Charlie!

29:52.261 --> 29:53.830
I-- what?

29:53.896 --> 29:57.000
You are actually the one who
flew over the cuckoo's nest.
You know that?

29:57.066 --> 30:00.203
Dating is all about timing.
I was so worried about you
I ruined my timing.

30:00.269 --> 30:02.705
Comedy is about timing.
Dating is about uttering
a syllable

30:02.772 --> 30:05.041
- When you're
with the stupid guy.
- You're a jerk.

30:05.108 --> 30:06.676
And you're acting
like a total baby.

30:06.743 --> 30:08.578
In dating years
you're in second grade.

30:08.645 --> 30:11.848
Who are you to talk
about dating? Who have you
ever dated except your cousin?

30:11.914 --> 30:15.251
He wasn't my cousin!
I only called his mom aunt
because we're close!

30:15.318 --> 30:17.153
Whatever.
All I know is
he's awfully tall.

30:17.220 --> 30:19.956
- <i>( applause )</i>
- Hey, lights are going down.
Places now!

30:29.265 --> 30:32.201
<i>( music playing )</i>

31:48.177 --> 31:51.114
- How's it going out there?
- The air conditioning's
not working.

31:51.180 --> 31:53.016
- It must smell great.
Who needs a spray?
- I do.

31:53.082 --> 31:54.751
Everyone, line up,
line up.

31:54.817 --> 31:56.953
All right, okay...

31:59.022 --> 32:00.757
- ( groans ) crap.
- I have to go back on!

32:00.823 --> 32:02.659
Chill, Clara.
I have more in here.

32:02.725 --> 32:05.328
- Okay, got it.
- ( shrieking )

32:05.395 --> 32:07.463
what?
What--

32:07.530 --> 32:10.166
- ( shrieks )
- Melanie: <i>What the hell is it?</i>

32:10.233 --> 32:12.602
- Oh my god!
- Ginny: <i>My eyes are melting!</i>

32:12.669 --> 32:15.405
- This isn't
hairspray, it's Mace.
- You maced us?!

32:15.471 --> 32:18.274
- I maced you.
- Why, why would you do that?

32:18.341 --> 32:20.977
- It was an accident.
- Ahh, that's my music!

32:21.044 --> 32:23.112
- Where's the stage?
- There there.

33:04.887 --> 33:06.389
- boo!
- <i>Here!</i>

33:06.456 --> 33:10.059
- Need a specific--
Up, down, right, left.
- <i>here.</i>

33:10.126 --> 33:12.195
- here.
- ahhh!

33:12.261 --> 33:15.398
I found you.
Uhhh ahhh ahhh.

33:15.465 --> 33:17.200
- ( moaning )
- Water, I've got water.

33:17.266 --> 33:20.069
Everyone, try to get your face
in front of the flying water!

33:20.136 --> 33:21.638
- Sasha: <i>Help me!</i>
- Sasha.

33:21.704 --> 33:23.272
- <i>Michelle?</i>
- Sasha!

33:23.339 --> 33:24.240
- Marco?
- <i>Polo!</i>

33:24.307 --> 33:26.109
- Marco?
- Polo!

33:28.411 --> 33:30.546
Ohhh, crap.
Okay, lemme try and find--

33:30.613 --> 33:32.849
something.

33:36.419 --> 33:38.921
I told you I'd be Clara.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.661
<i>( dancers clamoring )</i>

33:52.669 --> 33:55.004
( audience clamoring )

33:55.071 --> 33:57.707
<i>( sirens approaching )</i>

34:13.556 --> 34:15.558
( chattering )

34:16.926 --> 34:19.462
- How are your eyes?
- The left one's back.

34:19.529 --> 34:21.898
- Michelle:
<i>Ray ray, Stephanie.</i>
- that's good.

34:21.964 --> 34:24.200
- Girl: <i>Over here.</i>
- <i>Matisse?</i>

34:24.267 --> 34:26.769
- I hate Charlie.
- <i>right here.</i>

34:26.836 --> 34:30.206
- Michelle: <i>Katrina?</i>
<i>Katrina?</i>
- Me too.

34:30.273 --> 34:32.175
<i>- I'm here.</i>
<i>- Stephanie, Stephanie?</i>

34:32.241 --> 34:34.911
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Anna Maria,
Anna Maria, Anna Maria?

34:34.978 --> 34:37.113
- We don't have
an Anna Maria.
- We don't?

34:37.180 --> 34:39.449
- No.
- Who's the girl
I call Anna Maria?

34:39.515 --> 34:41.851
- Casey.
- Oh. Casey!

34:41.918 --> 34:44.354
- <i>Here.</i>
- Hey, kid,
you can't go four months

34:44.420 --> 34:47.023
letting someone
call you Anna Maria.
A little life tip for you.

34:47.090 --> 34:48.691
- You're Michelle?
- Yes, how are the kids?

34:48.758 --> 34:50.893
We flushed their eyes,
gave them ice,
everyone will be fine.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.829
- I just need to check you out.
- Not now, I'm busy.

34:52.895 --> 34:54.330
- Angel!
- <i>Yeah?</i>

34:54.397 --> 34:56.232
- I need to check
you out now, please.
- Look, lady,

34:56.299 --> 34:58.835
I'm not gonna
leave this hallway, okay?
I'm the one who maced these kids

34:58.901 --> 35:01.237
and I am going to be here
until every last one
of them is--

35:01.304 --> 35:03.272
I'm talking to a piece
of cardboard, right?

35:03.339 --> 35:05.475
- Yep.
- after you.

35:10.913 --> 35:13.950
Hey.
I know you.

35:14.017 --> 35:16.185
- Yeah?
- You're on
the basketball team.

35:16.252 --> 35:18.821
<i>Was </i>on
the basketball team.

35:18.888 --> 35:19.989
What happened?

35:20.056 --> 35:22.959
You dribble right,
you dribble left,
you dribble right,

35:23.026 --> 35:26.496
you dribble left-- That's
a lot of dribbling without
having some sort of stroke.

35:26.562 --> 35:29.265
- I hear you.
- I'm Roman.

35:29.332 --> 35:32.068
- I thought your name was Tyler.
- Roman's my middle name.

35:32.135 --> 35:35.738
- It works better with the hair.
- that's the thought process.

35:35.805 --> 35:40.043
- So what are you in for?
- Mosh pit got a little
too intense.

35:40.109 --> 35:43.179
- What about you?
- My ballet Teacher maced us

35:43.246 --> 35:46.082
- During a production
of "the nutcracker."
- Wow!

35:46.149 --> 35:49.652
- Maybe I should
be taking ballet.
- It's rougher than you think.

35:49.719 --> 35:53.523
- Apparently.
- So this look-- New?

35:53.589 --> 35:55.858
- Fairly recent.
- No more varsity Joe?

35:55.925 --> 35:58.828
I think we have
officially parted ways.

35:58.895 --> 36:01.864
- You're Sasha, right?
- Yeah.

36:01.931 --> 36:04.100
My middle name's
Henrietta, so...

36:04.167 --> 36:06.202
Sasha it is.

36:09.172 --> 36:10.907
- there you are.
- Family?

36:10.974 --> 36:12.475
- Sort of.
- I guess.

36:12.542 --> 36:14.944
- Daughter-in-Law
for a minute or so.
- mother-In-Law for a minute.

36:15.011 --> 36:16.479
- Landlord now.
- don't know what that
makes me now.

36:16.546 --> 36:18.748
Whatever. Come on in.
I'll be right back.
You'll be okay?

36:18.815 --> 36:20.650
- No.
- attagirl!

36:26.689 --> 36:29.325
- So how are you?
- Face hurts.

36:29.392 --> 36:30.960
Yes. Large doses

36:31.027 --> 36:33.830
of self-Inflicted Pepper spray
will do that to a person.

36:33.896 --> 36:35.765
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.

36:35.832 --> 36:39.002
You maced
my entire production
of "the nutcracker."

36:39.068 --> 36:40.737
I don't think
I got everyone.

36:40.803 --> 36:43.740
No, you did.
It was a clean sweep.
Nailed every last dewdrop.

36:43.806 --> 36:46.776
- I'm really sorry.
- You know I had to cancel
the shows.

36:46.843 --> 36:48.945
Two whole weeks, canceled.

36:49.012 --> 36:50.947
- I'm--
- You're sorry?
Yes, I heard.

36:51.014 --> 36:54.584
Do you know how bad this is?
I will be lucky if these parents

36:54.651 --> 36:56.886
don't drag me into court
and have me flogged.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.155
They don't flog people
in california.

36:59.222 --> 37:02.058
- You're a lawyer?
You know the law?
- I know they don't flog.

37:02.125 --> 37:05.194
Well, I don't know that.
I'm not as wise and worldly
as you are.

37:05.261 --> 37:08.331
I didn't live
in vegas and date gangsters.
I just tried to teach ballet

37:08.398 --> 37:12.201
to a bunch of kids-- The same
kids who are sitting out in
the hallway of this hospital.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.476
I should've known something
like this would happen.

37:20.543 --> 37:23.479
- Why? 'cause I was involved?
- Bad luck was in the air.

37:23.546 --> 37:26.582
When I got up this morning
and Michael was gone
just like that,

37:26.649 --> 37:28.651
- It was a sign.
- Michael's gone?

37:28.718 --> 37:30.486
- Yes.
- Why would he go?

37:30.553 --> 37:33.189
I explained
everything to him.

37:33.256 --> 37:35.792
What are you talking about?

37:35.858 --> 37:37.627
I told him about the cabin,

37:37.694 --> 37:39.962
about what you thought
Montana was going to be--

37:40.029 --> 37:42.231
you and him being
together finally.

37:42.298 --> 37:45.068
- Why would you do that?
- I was trying to help.

37:45.134 --> 37:48.137
- help who, me?
- Fanny, you don't
explain to a man

37:48.204 --> 37:52.408
you want to be with him
permanently, of course he goes
and buys a place for himself.

37:52.475 --> 37:56.045
And you know all this
based on what? Your perfect
relationship record?

37:56.112 --> 37:58.581
- I--
- 30 years I've been
with this man.

37:58.648 --> 38:01.851
For 30 years
he's felt free,
unencumbered.

38:01.918 --> 38:05.288
He's been able to live
the exact life he wanted
and we were happy.

38:05.355 --> 38:08.725
- You never saw each other.
- even when I asked him to hang
around a little longer

38:08.791 --> 38:11.728
he knew I wasn't trying
to change him or tie him down.

38:11.794 --> 38:14.731
And then you, with your
extraordinarily big mouth,

38:14.797 --> 38:17.867
you drive him away in one day.
What is wrong with you?

38:17.934 --> 38:20.236
<i>You don't know me</i>
<i>well enough by now</i>

38:20.303 --> 38:22.872
to know that if I wanted him
to know about the cabin

38:22.939 --> 38:26.643
and my plans and what
I expected to happen,
I would've told him myself?

38:26.709 --> 38:29.779
You are the bad luck!
Ever since you got here,

38:29.846 --> 38:32.015
ever since Hubbell--

38:39.055 --> 38:41.290
I have to go outside
and deal with the parents.

38:41.357 --> 38:44.627
You should probably stay
in here a little while longer.

Hello?

40:56.592 --> 40:58.294
What did you think?

41:00.363 --> 41:02.699
Wow.

41:02.765 --> 41:04.867
Hey.

41:04.934 --> 41:06.703
Where have you been?

41:06.769 --> 41:08.571
<i>Oh, I've been around.</i>

41:08.638 --> 41:11.641
- <i>( traffic noise stops )</i>
- Everything looks
so different now.

41:11.708 --> 41:15.912
No, nothing's different.
Everything's exactly where
it was when you left.

41:15.979 --> 41:19.182
I've tried really hard
not to rock the boat.

41:19.248 --> 41:22.085
You're here
to rock the boat.

41:23.252 --> 41:25.688
You know, she always
wanted me to dance.

41:25.755 --> 41:28.858
( laughs )
Oh, what I would've given
for a picture of that.

41:28.925 --> 41:31.394
Yeah.
She would've liked a girl.

41:34.664 --> 41:36.733
Hubbell?

41:38.067 --> 41:41.704
- They're broken.
- I just wanted to see
the frogs.

41:41.771 --> 41:44.073
I'm doing it again.
I'm ruining everything.

41:44.140 --> 41:47.043
- You can fix it.
- I don't even know
that I'm doing it.

41:47.110 --> 41:50.246
I need glue.
You're my glue.

41:50.313 --> 41:53.449
- These four are fine.
- I was supposed to
take care of them.

41:53.516 --> 41:55.585
I was supposed
to help them.

41:55.652 --> 41:57.654
I was supposed to
be better for them.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.957
I don't want them
to be like me.

42:01.024 --> 42:03.226
You should look around.

42:03.292 --> 42:05.395
Everything is different.

42:06.896 --> 42:10.099
- I miss you.
- It's funny when
things happen.

42:10.166 --> 42:12.702
Hubbell,
tell me something.

42:12.769 --> 42:14.003
What?

42:14.070 --> 42:15.805
Would it have worked?

42:15.872 --> 42:18.541
Would I have stayed?

42:18.608 --> 42:21.344
P.A.:

<i>Social services,</i>
<i>call the fourth floor</i>
<i>nurses' station.</i>

- Fanny: <i>I know you're</i>
<i>all upset.</i>

42:29.352 --> 42:32.121
Man: <i>I'm not upset.</i>
<i>I love picking my kid up</i>

Woman:
<i>That woman is never around</i>
<i>our children ever again.</i>

42:34.791 --> 42:36.893
Man:
She's unstable. The other
night in the oyster bar,

42:36.959 --> 42:38.861
she had sex
with that bartender
at the party.

42:38.928 --> 42:40.363
Man #2:
Who cares what
she did at the bar?

42:40.430 --> 42:41.664
Man:
I care what she did
at the bar.

42:41.731 --> 42:43.499
I eat brunch there
on sundays.

42:43.566 --> 42:46.502
- Fanny: Everyone
needs to calm down.
- Woman: She maced our kids!

42:46.569 --> 42:49.138
- Sprayed Pepper spray
in their faces.
- Doctor: Hey, you need to move.

42:49.205 --> 42:51.674
- We have to work here.
- Fanny: Please, let's just
talk outside.

42:51.741 --> 42:53.643
- Man: She's gone, Fanny!
- Woman: Exactly.

42:55.878 --> 42:57.714
"O captain,
my captain!"

43:01.884 --> 43:03.953
"O captain,

43:06.856 --> 43:08.524
BOTH:
"o captain, my captain!"

43:10.860 --> 43:12.395
I don't know
what that means.

43:12.462 --> 43:14.664
- Just get up.
- I don't watch Cable.

43:15.898 --> 43:17.900
You know that at the end
of the movie

43:17.967 --> 43:19.635
the guy had to leave
anyhow, right?

43:22.939 --> 43:24.741
Thank you, boys.

43:26.542 --> 43:28.645
Thank you, girls.

43:28.711 --> 43:29.712
Thank you.
