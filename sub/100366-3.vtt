WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.336
There will be just 30 minutes

00:01.372 --> 00:03.977
before we know if this storm
will fuse a few kettles

00:04.013 --> 00:05.755
or send us back to the Stone Age.

00:05.791 --> 00:06.791
Anna?

00:06.961 --> 00:08.606
You didn't answer my letters.

00:08.642 --> 00:11.206
Four super-transformers
on the electricity grid

00:11.242 --> 00:14.557
have been burned out, leaving large
areas of the country without power.

00:14.593 --> 00:16.152
I have spoken to Her Majesty

00:16.189 --> 00:18.055
and informed her of the measures
I intend to take

00:18.090 --> 00:19.937
under the emergency legislation.

00:19.973 --> 00:21.546
Have you ever seen a transformer?

00:22.450 --> 00:24.815
How long does
transformer replacement take?

00:24.850 --> 00:26.581
In some cases it can be
a question of weeks.

00:26.617 --> 00:27.667
Northumberland can wait.

00:27.703 --> 00:30.668
Get the rest on the road
with military protection immediately.

00:31.130 --> 00:34.215
The situation is getting worse here,
minute by minute.

00:34.250 --> 00:37.816
So, which virtue-signalling ponce
has been lined up to replace him?

00:37.852 --> 00:40.019
Francine Bridge was one thought
that occurred to me.

00:40.055 --> 00:41.100
A little while ago,

00:41.136 --> 00:44.176
Georgia's parents agreed to
switch off her life support machine.

00:46.010 --> 00:47.530
- Fire!
- Fire!

00:48.187 --> 00:50.895
I can't let Ellie face
the possibility of prison, Robert.

00:51.136 --> 00:53.127
Leave it to me and Peter,
we will get through this.

00:53.163 --> 00:54.648
A situation has developed

00:54.684 --> 00:57.857
at the university next to the Hadley
Brook Immigration Removal Centre.

01:05.069 --> 01:06.350
It wasn't all of them.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.170 --> 01:19.135
Like, at first, it was really friendly,
we had a party going on,

01:19.170 --> 01:20.170
and then...

01:21.290 --> 01:25.210
...there were a couple who started,
like, harassing the girls.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.881
The main guy was
the one with the face...

01:30.410 --> 01:33.135
He had, like, markings on his face.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.135
I don't know, like,
blotches down one side.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.975
He was the main trouble-maker.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.650
He was the one who started
dragging girls into rooms.

01:42.690 --> 01:45.699
Things just started getting out
of hand, there was a fight, and...

01:48.218 --> 01:50.294
...then one of them
tried to stop him, but...

01:52.450 --> 01:53.930
He was the one that got stabbed.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.400
- Sir? Buses are ready to go.
- Thanks.

02:03.436 --> 02:07.476
- Where are we going?
- Our command centre is in the hospital.

02:07.730 --> 02:11.375
It still has power, so we can try to
arrange to get you home from there.

02:11.410 --> 02:13.295
It definitely wasn't all of them.

02:13.447 --> 02:16.287
But the guy with the face markings,
the ringleader, he was...

02:19.050 --> 02:20.330
Yeah, he was just bad.

02:28.296 --> 02:31.407
So, if you bring this to us later,
we'll definitely get them all signed.

02:32.732 --> 02:34.472
I thought you were staying
with Francine Bridge?

02:34.508 --> 02:37.833
She was busy with her Resilience Forum,
so I checked into this hotel.

02:37.869 --> 02:38.949
Are you OK?

02:43.130 --> 02:45.255
I'm fine. I'm fine!

02:45.803 --> 02:47.966
What's happened at the university?

02:48.930 --> 02:51.295
Well, as far as we can tell,
it was all a big fiesta

02:51.330 --> 02:53.575
while the students
waited for evacuation.

02:54.121 --> 02:56.785
Then, a few of the escapees
from Hadley Brooke showed up,

02:56.821 --> 02:58.018
trouble started.

02:58.573 --> 03:01.083
- Two girls were raped.
- Oh, Jesus.

03:01.119 --> 03:03.364
One of the escapees
actually tried to stop it,

03:03.400 --> 03:04.480
he was stabbed in the neck.

03:04.516 --> 03:06.854
I wonder what angle the press will take?

03:07.038 --> 03:08.758
There was a ringleader, apparently.

03:09.770 --> 03:14.215
He's been identified as a violent
criminal called Nojus Sabonis.

03:14.894 --> 03:18.095
He was awaiting repatriation
to Lithuania,

03:18.303 --> 03:21.855
having served a six-year sentence
for an acid attack on his girlfriend.

03:22.356 --> 03:24.010
- Have they found him?
- No.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.855
I have to go up there, Anna.
To Northumberland.

03:29.055 --> 03:30.815
Are you sure? It sounds like...

03:30.850 --> 03:33.535
I'll wait and find out
we're not just getting in the way,

03:33.570 --> 03:35.970
but... I have to go there.

04:07.090 --> 04:11.135
The nationwide blackout that plunged
the UK into darkness over a week ago

04:11.170 --> 04:13.055
has still not been completely resolved

04:13.090 --> 04:16.295
and a significant part of the
country remains without power.

04:16.329 --> 04:18.894
The government has declared
a national emergency,

04:18.930 --> 04:22.815
with special measures that include
a ban on all unauthorised travel

04:22.850 --> 04:25.135
within and between
certain designated areas,

04:25.371 --> 04:27.975
especially the Red Zone
of North East England.

04:28.064 --> 04:31.191
This includes large cities,
like Newcastle and Sunderland,

04:31.227 --> 04:33.479
which have effectively
come to a standstill.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.815
The travel ban has come under
intense scrutiny and criticism

04:37.850 --> 04:39.255
by opposition parties.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.215
There are reports of people collapsing

04:41.250 --> 04:44.135
after being forced to walk
miles to relief centres

04:44.170 --> 04:46.810
for basic resources, aid and shelter.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.564
- Can I see your paperwork please, sir?
- Yeah, no problem.

05:00.530 --> 05:01.650
Cheers.

05:05.468 --> 05:08.775
They started coming within
a few hours of the blackout.

05:08.810 --> 05:11.935
First in their tens,
then their hundreds.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.255
It's now thought that over 2,000 people

05:14.290 --> 05:17.095
have sought refuge at
the Royal Northumberland Hospital,

05:17.130 --> 05:19.930
from where the relief operation
in the Red Zone is...

05:24.890 --> 05:25.930
Sorry!

05:55.769 --> 05:56.974
Freckles?

05:57.330 --> 05:59.655
It was his prison nickname apparently.

05:59.992 --> 06:03.655
Mainstream media, just trying
to demonise immigrants again.

06:03.690 --> 06:06.775
Wait, wait, is the right answer
"Western foreign policy"?

06:06.810 --> 06:09.069
Sorry, how many kids got bombed
in the Yemen this week?

06:09.105 --> 06:11.630
- Who's going to prison for that?
- He's got you there.

06:11.666 --> 06:15.454
Can I just point out, this guy is
not an impoverished asylum seeker,

06:15.490 --> 06:19.335
but a hardened woman-hating criminal
from Lithuania.

06:19.370 --> 06:20.815
He got the facial markings

06:20.850 --> 06:22.975
in an acid attack
on a defenceless young girl.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.770
Yeah, save it for The Hague, you melt.

06:27.050 --> 06:31.055
Right, this neoliberal discourse
will not write itself,

06:31.090 --> 06:33.815
so I am gonna lock myself
in the study for the next hour or so.

06:33.850 --> 06:36.215
I've got no idea
what time we'll be back,

06:36.250 --> 06:38.076
so I'll probably stay at Maddie's again,

06:38.112 --> 06:39.744
- she's down in her constituency.
- Yeah, sure.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.461
Yeah, Fraser, hi.

06:45.669 --> 06:47.005
Good morning, everyone.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.295
So, we've re-coded the zones
still without power

06:50.330 --> 06:52.175
or with very little supply.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.615
The Red Zone is Northumberland,
north of Newcastle

06:55.650 --> 06:57.775
and reaching as far as Stockton.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.455
Yellow Zone is North Wales,

06:59.490 --> 07:01.935
from the Llyn Peninsula
across to Prestatyn.

07:01.970 --> 07:04.951
Green is west coast of Scotland,
north of Kilmarnock.

07:04.987 --> 07:07.392
And Blue is North Cornwall,
west of Camelford.

07:07.437 --> 07:10.642
The rest of the UK, approximately
80%, is in the White Zone,

07:10.678 --> 07:13.440
where power is almost fully restored,
but subject to brownouts.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.281
- We're visiting the Red Zone?
- Mm-hmm.

07:15.317 --> 07:17.328
We'll stop at the first
roadblock between zones

07:17.364 --> 07:18.883
so the PM can speak
to some of the troops

07:18.919 --> 07:20.404
enforcing the zonal traffic controls.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.630
Kettling.

07:21.839 --> 07:23.084
It's not kettling.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.277
People are walking out
with what they can carry.

07:25.398 --> 07:28.861
It's preserving fuel so we can keep
our emergency centres running.

07:28.928 --> 07:30.912
We leave straight after
this morning's COBRA.

07:30.948 --> 07:32.180
The PM will travel in his car.

07:32.216 --> 07:34.444
You lot will follow behind
in a special bus

07:34.480 --> 07:36.577
also carrying medical supplies.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.545
He'll come on board to chat
from time to time.

07:38.642 --> 07:41.436
And will this bus have some kind
of message of hope on it or...?

07:41.472 --> 07:42.722
Cos I'm definitely
gonna fall for questions

07:42.758 --> 07:45.168
about messages on the side of buses.

07:45.204 --> 07:46.867
Any update on Freckles?

07:47.155 --> 07:50.614
Obviously, the search continues
for the escaped detainees.

07:50.953 --> 07:53.095
Can I please ask you
to report this responsibly.

07:53.130 --> 07:55.175
They're not refugees or failed migrants,

07:55.581 --> 07:56.935
several were hardened criminals,

07:56.970 --> 07:58.979
legitimately in the UK
at the time of their arrest.

07:59.015 --> 08:01.376
Is Rachel Sutherland
travelling with her husband?

08:01.412 --> 08:02.337
No.

08:02.373 --> 08:04.287
Because of the situation
with their daughter?

08:04.323 --> 08:06.212
There is no situation
with their daughter.

08:06.549 --> 08:08.754
I hear the police
may interview Ellie again.

08:08.930 --> 08:10.815
Is the PM gonna make any comment

08:10.850 --> 08:13.810
in light of Toby Kennedy-Brown's
revelations to my paper?

08:15.645 --> 08:18.130
You have me at a disadvantage, Cressida.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.851
He was at the party
where Georgia Nixon died.

08:20.887 --> 08:22.847
We're running a piece
with him on Sunday.

08:23.749 --> 08:25.112
Well, the Prime Minister is rather busy

08:25.148 --> 08:27.011
trying to deal with
the national emergency,

08:27.119 --> 08:30.355
but, of course, the entire family is
devastated by the death of a friend.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.895
Right, see you all later
for the big road trip.

08:34.929 --> 08:36.847
I hope you all brought
lots of refreshments.

08:40.809 --> 08:43.409
I've invited Francine Bridge
onto the bus.

08:44.290 --> 08:48.215
She called me a monument
to unconscious sexism at PMQs once.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.975
Oh, you know, the cut and thrust
of parliamentary debate...

08:51.010 --> 08:54.386
- Very unfair. I'm actually a feminist.
- Never say that again.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.255
Anna, I can't tell you
how relieved I was

09:00.290 --> 09:03.690
to hear you hadn't burned
alive in that hotel.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.615
- Thank you so much.
- And hubby back safely, too.

09:08.064 --> 09:10.384
Hope to see him
back on our screens soon.

09:12.210 --> 09:16.843
- What's up with the friendly snark?
- No idea, but I don't like it.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.430
So, all I really know is one of
the Sundays is running a piece.

09:22.466 --> 09:24.693
It could just be about
the dangers of fentanyl.

09:24.729 --> 09:25.852
It could be.

09:25.888 --> 09:28.015
Do you know a guy called
Toby Kennedy-Brown?

09:28.361 --> 09:30.455
- Yeah.
- He was at the party?

09:30.623 --> 09:31.623
Yeah.

09:32.853 --> 09:35.102
He's the one been talking
to the journalist doing the piece.

09:35.138 --> 09:37.656
Toby? He's, like, the biggest...

09:37.692 --> 09:40.257
I mean, he'd stick his finger
in a plug socket for a hit.

09:40.610 --> 09:43.295
Just stick entirely to the story
you told the police

09:43.330 --> 09:44.495
the first time round.

09:44.530 --> 09:46.255
Why do they want to speak to me again?

09:46.290 --> 09:47.861
Georgia's father has been very vocal.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.171
They need to be seen to do
everything they can

09:50.207 --> 09:53.172
- to avoid any accusations of...
- Favouring the posh white girl.

09:53.208 --> 09:54.933
- Precisely.
- He'd be right, though.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.095
That's exactly what's going on.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.135
Because posh white girls
tend to fare very badly in prison.

10:00.171 --> 10:02.165
Just leave it with me. All right?

10:02.810 --> 10:06.410
This will all blow over soon,
as long as we stick to the script.

10:07.634 --> 10:08.959
Good morning, everyone.

10:08.995 --> 10:11.760
Now, as you're aware,
I shall be leaving for the Red Zone

10:11.796 --> 10:13.441
immediately after this meeting.

10:13.632 --> 10:16.255
I do think the current climate
is unfavourable

10:16.290 --> 10:18.095
for a visit by you, Prime Minister.

10:18.130 --> 10:19.901
Well, running scared
from the current climate

10:19.937 --> 10:21.167
has never done us any favours.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.113
The police are very anxious

10:23.149 --> 10:24.834
that, with conditions in the camp,

10:24.870 --> 10:27.411
the atmosphere will be
intensely hostile to you personally.

10:27.447 --> 10:29.347
They should attend a cabinet meeting.

10:29.383 --> 10:31.335
I have to say, Prime Minister,

10:31.370 --> 10:33.935
that I do share
the Home Secretary's concerns.

10:33.970 --> 10:37.329
I have major worries
about the security implications.

10:37.940 --> 10:39.655
We should wait and send a royal.

10:39.690 --> 10:41.735
We have to show
that we're not frightened.

10:42.688 --> 10:44.135
Now, I've asked the Press Secretary

10:44.170 --> 10:47.335
to request
that the editors ease off a little

10:47.370 --> 10:50.535
on this situation with the Hadley
Brooke rapist still on the run.

10:50.570 --> 10:53.775
Catching Freckles
would be a low-cost morale boost.

10:53.810 --> 10:56.095
I have to question
whether an extensive manhunt

10:56.130 --> 10:58.095
is a reasonable use of scarce resources

10:58.130 --> 10:59.735
during this current emergency.

10:59.770 --> 11:02.775
He and his refugee mates
did rape a bunch of girls.

11:02.810 --> 11:03.850
Two.

11:05.770 --> 11:07.935
I'm surprised to see you of all people

11:07.970 --> 11:11.335
downplaying the seriousness
of such a crime, Anna.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.375
I won't dignify that with a response.

11:13.410 --> 11:14.968
But the last thing we need right now

11:15.004 --> 11:16.929
is a scare campaign against immigrants.

11:16.965 --> 11:21.348
Oh, yes, heaven forbid we should put
anybody's interests above theirs.

11:25.330 --> 11:26.763
Remember Cologne?

11:28.489 --> 11:30.575
This was not Cologne.

11:30.610 --> 11:34.135
And one of the escapees nearly died
trying to prevent it...

11:34.170 --> 11:35.455
I will take a very dim view

11:35.490 --> 11:38.295
on anyone who fans the flames
of xenophobia right now.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.855
This country is on the brink.

11:40.315 --> 11:43.115
We do nothing to further division
or disorder.

11:57.390 --> 12:00.515
Yeah. OK, good. Yeah, that one.

12:00.550 --> 12:02.195
OK, hold on.

12:02.230 --> 12:04.826
Fraser, a relief lorry
has been hijacked near Doncaster.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.195
- What was it carrying?
- Bottled water.

12:07.822 --> 12:09.544
It's gonna cause a big problem.

12:09.912 --> 12:12.355
Red Zone's already
running close to zero,

12:12.390 --> 12:14.475
we need a replacement
on the road at once.

12:14.510 --> 12:17.835
Uh... Yeah, the warehouses
are also reporting shortages.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.635
Then a tanker. Anything.

12:19.670 --> 12:21.134
We can't have them running out of water,

12:21.170 --> 12:22.741
especially with the PM about to show up.

12:23.306 --> 12:24.526
Fraser Walker.

12:25.451 --> 12:26.451
Yeah.

12:31.370 --> 12:34.370
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:39.850 --> 12:41.130
OK, leave it with me.

12:46.090 --> 12:49.922
- I'm shitting myself, Anna.
- This is where you're at your best,

12:50.750 --> 12:53.390
thinking on your feet,
dealing with a hostile crowd.

12:53.936 --> 12:56.715
- I have no empathy.
- Of course you do.

12:57.241 --> 12:59.553
I'm not here to feel your pain.

12:59.690 --> 13:02.578
I am here to tell you how we're
gonna get the lights back on.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.640
You see? That's good.

13:05.340 --> 13:08.115
Everyone talks about empathy these days.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.922
But that's not gonna
get the lights back on.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.278
No, keep it first person.

13:13.226 --> 13:17.190
You know, i-it's easy enough to hug
survivors and blame the government,

13:17.550 --> 13:20.955
but it's much, much harder
to actually put things right.

13:20.990 --> 13:23.555
No, it's too obvious,
it's too party political.

13:24.058 --> 13:25.715
Plus, it reminds people

13:25.750 --> 13:27.556
that we haven't always been
the party of hugs.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.286
Kick out the jams, motherfuckers.

13:32.322 --> 13:33.724
I'd rather you hated me than forgot me.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.577
Smashed it. Let's hit the road.

13:44.670 --> 13:48.275
I called him a monument to
unconscious sexism at PMQs once.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.942
Oh, don't worry, he won't remember that.

13:50.310 --> 13:51.870
Been called far worse.

13:53.110 --> 13:54.755
Pleased to see you, Francine.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.597
Monumentally pleased, in fact.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.438
OK, I lied. He never forgets an insult.

13:59.474 --> 14:00.759
I am glad you've joined us.

14:00.795 --> 14:02.790
Hopefully we'll get a chance
to chat on the journey.

14:03.155 --> 14:05.331
They're running low on bottled water
in the Red Zone.

14:06.910 --> 14:09.052
What do you mean
you're running low on water?

14:09.470 --> 14:12.049
I mean, blood, insulin, I can kinda get,

14:12.430 --> 14:14.647
but water's pretty damn basic,
don't you think?

14:14.683 --> 14:17.048
- Well, it's because...
- I don't care about the reason, Fraser,

14:17.084 --> 14:18.544
just get it bloody sorted.

14:18.950 --> 14:22.100
I don't wanna turn up there and
see crying kids begging for water.

14:22.585 --> 14:24.891
That would look pretty fucking
regrettable, don't you think?

14:27.018 --> 14:28.778
No glitches, remember?

15:12.067 --> 15:13.427
I shall see you anon.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.331
I thought you might be going
on the magical mystery tour.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.652
Better stories here.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.595
Have you actually been outside the M25?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.507
Yes. I lived in Scotland, actually.

15:24.543 --> 15:28.163
I'm not sure the University
of St Andrews really counts.

15:28.606 --> 15:31.611
I trolled the Press Secretary gently
with Toby Kennedy-Brown.

15:31.647 --> 15:33.167
- Does he know what he said?
- No.

15:34.550 --> 15:37.995
Peter Mott and Rachel Sutherland
have been coaching Ellie

15:38.030 --> 15:39.568
for her police interviews.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.448
If I were a journalist,

15:41.484 --> 15:44.849
I'd want to know the degree to which
the Prime Minister sanctioned that.

15:45.058 --> 15:46.924
And if I were a politician,

15:47.135 --> 15:50.115
I'd also be setting up
a few ambushes at PMQs.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.115
You need him to lie to parliament.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.869
That's what always gets them in the end.

15:53.905 --> 15:55.265
One step at a time.

15:57.870 --> 15:59.750
Right, I'm on the radio in half an hour.

16:00.496 --> 16:03.014
Listen up,
cos I'm gonna melt a few snowflakes.

16:04.510 --> 16:08.315
This is the second violent attack
in as many days

16:08.350 --> 16:10.555
on drivers who are
working round the clock

16:10.590 --> 16:13.195
to try and deliver emergency supplies

16:13.230 --> 16:15.315
to vulnerable people in the Red Zone.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.741
Shit, that's all we bloody need.

16:18.249 --> 16:20.346
General Secretary
of the Lorry Drivers' Union...

16:20.382 --> 16:23.067
I was wondering when we'd hear
from Comrade Rowntree.

16:23.336 --> 16:26.858
- What's he saying?
- That it's all our fault.

16:27.643 --> 16:29.689
Not ruling out a national stoppage.

16:34.155 --> 16:35.235
Peter.

16:37.547 --> 16:40.791
OK. I'm just with Anna,
so I'll talk to you at the next stop.

16:41.398 --> 16:42.518
OK.

16:46.112 --> 16:48.787
- What's that about?
- Oh, just Peter.

16:50.734 --> 16:52.921
I said, "What's it about?"
not, "Who was it?"

16:55.348 --> 16:57.830
Ellie's just finished
with the police, apparently.

16:59.521 --> 17:01.592
Right, so, Peter's...

17:01.628 --> 17:04.752
Francine Bridge must know
a thing or two about Harry Rowntree.

17:05.249 --> 17:06.703
Have her come and sit up with us.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.760
- That was terrible.
- Well, it's over now.

17:11.796 --> 17:14.761
- They knew!
- Don't think about it.

17:14.797 --> 17:19.156
- It's finished. Put it behind you.
- Put it behind me?!

17:22.150 --> 17:28.700
Oh, Ellie... Oh, God.
I meant the interview, sweetheart.

17:29.390 --> 17:30.750
Not Georgia.

17:31.910 --> 17:35.190
Please...
Please, stop torturing yourself.

18:06.705 --> 18:07.905
Peter.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.990
No, fucking awful.

18:38.790 --> 18:42.230
This is the last of the water bottles.

18:42.853 --> 18:44.978
We'll soon have water, very soon.

18:45.310 --> 18:46.830
It's all gone.

18:46.866 --> 18:49.220
The rest of you will have to wait
for the next delivery.

18:49.312 --> 18:52.274
There's no more water, it's all gone.

18:52.310 --> 18:53.755
- Come on, love.
- I'm next!

18:53.791 --> 18:54.791
You're next.

18:56.409 --> 18:59.374
I'm next! I was next!

18:59.698 --> 19:01.938
Please, my daughter is thirsty.

19:03.990 --> 19:06.830
It's ladies first in this country.

19:09.070 --> 19:11.205
You were next, love. I'm sorry.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.795
I'm not jumping the queue.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.946
He's got a bairn, as well!

19:22.950 --> 19:24.595
- You see his face, though?
- Yeah.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.670
- Them marks?
- That's him. That's Freckles.

19:58.867 --> 20:00.512
Downing Street, meanwhile, has confirmed

20:00.548 --> 20:03.932
that the Prime Minister will visit
the Red Zone relief camp today,

20:04.131 --> 20:06.176
after criticism from the opposition

20:06.212 --> 20:09.097
that the government is abusing
its emergency powers...

20:09.133 --> 20:11.024
How many people are travelling
between the zones?

20:11.234 --> 20:13.679
Not so many now,
but it was difficult at first.

20:13.715 --> 20:15.640
I understand. Thank you very much.

20:19.162 --> 20:22.070
- What's happening with Ellie?
- It's under control.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.141
It's imperative he's not
seen to be influencing...

20:25.177 --> 20:26.702
- Anna...
- ...at any point, Peter...

20:26.738 --> 20:29.460
- ...you do your job and I'll do mine.
- He is my job.

20:30.493 --> 20:32.863
Especially if it looks like his
daughter has just lied to the police

20:32.899 --> 20:33.897
with his knowledge.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.015
It's all under control.

21:16.790 --> 21:18.713
Well, they were supposed to
be here half an hour ago.

21:18.749 --> 21:20.297
Look, where is the water tanker now?

21:21.190 --> 21:22.915
Right, well, put your fucking foot down,

21:22.951 --> 21:25.511
because this place will slide
into anarchy without water.

21:27.030 --> 21:28.327
Shit.

21:28.950 --> 21:31.316
Sir! Sir, come quickly.
They're gonna kill him.

21:31.352 --> 21:32.364
We can't hold them anymore.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.880
- What's going on?
- They're gonna lynch somebody!

22:12.670 --> 22:13.670
Stop!

22:15.430 --> 22:16.510
Stop!

22:17.737 --> 22:18.822
Move!

22:18.858 --> 22:19.858
Stop!

22:21.902 --> 22:25.387
Stop! Stop! This is murder. Stop!

22:25.632 --> 22:27.637
What the hell is going on here?!

22:32.020 --> 22:33.672
He's trying to say something!

22:37.350 --> 22:38.995
Whoa! Whoa!

22:39.030 --> 22:40.272
Vitiligo!

22:40.390 --> 22:44.035
Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.274
Vitiligo. He's got vitiligo.

22:46.310 --> 22:49.035
It's a skin condition, not acid burns.

22:49.070 --> 22:50.675
Listen, man! Please!

22:50.710 --> 22:52.755
This isn't the guy you think it is, OK?

22:53.254 --> 22:56.310
He's not Freckles! He's not Freckles!

22:57.392 --> 23:00.117
Just let me unfasten him
and I will let you go, OK?

23:00.755 --> 23:02.007
OK? I promise.

23:04.695 --> 23:06.415
I'm just gonna unfasten him, right?

23:22.299 --> 23:23.499
Come on.

23:31.989 --> 23:35.354
Look at you all!
You're behaving like animals!

23:35.879 --> 23:38.350
Fuck off! Is this what we've come to?

23:39.470 --> 23:41.350
Jarvis, help me get him inside!

23:58.030 --> 23:59.773
Gold Commander says it isn't safe.

24:00.110 --> 24:01.948
They're still waiting
on the water tankers

24:01.984 --> 24:03.816
and they've just narrowly
avoided a lynching.

24:03.852 --> 24:04.852
What?!

24:05.277 --> 24:06.482
There were a few people

24:06.518 --> 24:10.034
who mistook a dark-skinned
Asian man with vitiligo

24:10.070 --> 24:13.555
for a blue-eyed Lithuanian
with acid burns.

24:13.591 --> 24:14.656
Is he all right?

24:14.784 --> 24:17.704
Well, suspected fractured skull
among other things.

24:18.637 --> 24:20.167
They took him into the hospital,

24:20.203 --> 24:23.941
and there are still rumours Freckles
is in there, being protected.

24:23.977 --> 24:25.742
I think you should get back to the car.

24:25.778 --> 24:27.778
I don't want the press taking
pictures of us stranded here.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.347
Hey! Are you OK?

24:38.410 --> 24:41.675
Absolute PR catastrophe
if I have to turn around.

24:41.710 --> 24:44.331
It'll be even worse if it starts
kicking off at the hospital.

24:55.070 --> 24:56.675
You look like you haven't slept
more than two hours

24:56.711 --> 24:58.178
since this whole thing started.

24:59.025 --> 25:00.256
More or less.

25:02.641 --> 25:05.083
I've been popping pills
to cope with the lack of sleep.

25:05.119 --> 25:07.123
Well, I'd knock that shit
on the head if I were you.

25:09.924 --> 25:12.174
I was pleased to hear
you might join Policy.

25:13.863 --> 25:15.703
You were a massive loss to the party.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.895
Are you still a member?

25:19.454 --> 25:21.003
I left because...

25:22.581 --> 25:23.898
of everything, really.

25:25.550 --> 25:26.670
I'm still a bit...

25:27.681 --> 25:31.561
- Well, actually, I'm a bit homeless.
- Join the club.

25:33.175 --> 25:34.255
Fraser.

25:35.750 --> 25:36.870
No, no. No, no.

25:38.284 --> 25:40.729
One of your staff just
told me about your father.

25:40.910 --> 25:43.270
- Oh, i-i-i-it's not because of that.
- No, I...

25:44.334 --> 25:45.974
Losing a parent's just...

25:48.310 --> 25:52.578
I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier
about the water situation.

25:56.023 --> 25:57.782
You're doing a fantastic job.

25:58.313 --> 25:59.379
Thank you.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.665
Better go and hide back in the car.

26:05.102 --> 26:06.302
Have you decided?

26:07.968 --> 26:11.408
On the advice of the security detail,
we're heading back to London.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.853
Well, that really won't look good.

26:17.081 --> 26:19.795
Home Secretary,
civil liberty campaigners

26:19.830 --> 26:23.296
have been expressing concern
about the rise in vigilantism.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.523
Of course they have.

26:26.108 --> 26:28.713
Lynching of alleged looters
and rising...

26:28.749 --> 26:31.512
- So, I just apologised to Fraser.
- Listen.

26:31.809 --> 26:34.435
...are you not worried about mob rule?

26:34.470 --> 26:39.435
I am more worried about dangerous
foreign criminals roaming around,

26:39.470 --> 26:40.875
attacking young women.

26:40.910 --> 26:45.315
And I have far greater trust
in people's justice

26:45.350 --> 26:47.795
than in the bleatings
of the diversity lobby.

26:47.830 --> 26:51.030
- But in the current climate...
- Particularly in the current climate.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.075
That miserable bastard.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.633
Just the message
we wanna be putting out

26:56.830 --> 26:58.310
He knows we're stuck here.

26:59.430 --> 27:02.250
He must be pissing himself laughing
while he stirs the pot.

27:04.690 --> 27:05.690
- Fuck it.
- No!

27:05.726 --> 27:06.726
- We're going.
- It's not safe.

27:06.762 --> 27:07.767
I don't care.

27:07.803 --> 27:10.399
Tell the Gold Commander to make
arrangements for a safe arrival

27:10.725 --> 27:12.701
and to prepare some kind of PA system.

27:12.737 --> 27:16.195
I cannot, will not let
that utter charlatan speak for us.

27:22.710 --> 27:25.301
Well, I believe that is not
the right decision at the moment.

27:28.584 --> 27:29.909
Fine, fine.

27:30.030 --> 27:31.675
If anyone's gonna get torn to pieces,

27:31.711 --> 27:33.277
it might as well be a politician.

27:34.150 --> 27:39.615
Bring him out! Bring him out!
Bring him out!

27:57.047 --> 27:59.319
So, while the cat's away...

27:59.355 --> 28:02.360
The cat's right here.
It's the mice that have fucked off.

28:02.724 --> 28:06.035
I heard your interview.
People's justice.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.955
- That's not very subtle.
- Nor are my supporters.

28:08.990 --> 28:11.110
Opening shots in a leadership challenge?

28:12.069 --> 28:15.106
The advisers are having
some interesting chats in the bars.

28:16.061 --> 28:18.817
Did you see Harry Rowntree's
threatened to stop the fuel deliveries?

28:18.965 --> 28:21.148
Obviously, that would be disastrous

28:21.184 --> 28:24.239
and I would suggest stringing him up
from a gibbet on the M1

28:24.275 --> 28:25.166
for treachery.

28:25.202 --> 28:28.202
Yeah, although it's win-win
for you, isn't it?

28:30.112 --> 28:32.312
Ellie's just had her police interview.

28:35.110 --> 28:37.997
- She definitely supplied the drugs.
- Of course she did.

28:38.033 --> 28:40.953
And blamed a dead girl,
with her parents' support.

28:41.030 --> 28:42.239
More debatable.

28:42.875 --> 28:45.330
They might try and push
the Press Secretary under the bus.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.874
That might work to our advantage.

28:48.910 --> 28:51.975
If I know Peter Mott, he'll flip
rather than take the blame.

28:52.661 --> 28:56.765
It has to be clear that the PM knew
what he was doing and okayed it.

28:58.390 --> 29:01.310
Letting foreign rapists roam freely.

29:02.070 --> 29:05.203
Failure at a time of national emergency.

29:05.884 --> 29:07.804
Perverting the course of justice.

29:09.195 --> 29:10.393
He's toast.

29:15.984 --> 29:18.434
I'm sorry you had to come through
the kitchen area, sir, but...

29:18.470 --> 29:20.640
It's where they shot Bobby Kennedy,
of course.

29:21.950 --> 29:23.279
I didn't know that.

29:24.298 --> 29:26.788
I really recommend you don't go
outside, Prime Minister,

29:26.824 --> 29:27.939
the mood is very ugly.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.750
It's why I have a security detail,
isn't it?

29:29.786 --> 29:32.266
I don't think your security
detail fending off an angry mob

29:32.302 --> 29:33.872
is quite the look we're aiming for
with this trip.

29:33.908 --> 29:36.257
Get some shots on the wards
with the plane crash victims.

29:36.293 --> 29:38.689
I wanna see the man
who was attacked first.

29:39.692 --> 29:41.183
He's very poorly, sir.

29:41.670 --> 29:43.536
I can take you to the crash victims.

29:46.770 --> 29:48.270
We'll talk to the medics.

29:49.257 --> 29:51.782
I'd like to introduce you
to my Silver Commander.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.355
This is Assistant Chief
Constable Crawford.

29:54.644 --> 29:57.791
- He's in giddy mode.
- I know. Don't let him go outside.

29:57.941 --> 29:59.046
You think it's that easy?

29:59.082 --> 30:02.234
Stop muttering, you two.
I have very good hearing.

30:02.270 --> 30:03.475
When you want to.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.390
You were a war reporter, Anna, for
God's sake, show a bit of backbone.

30:06.426 --> 30:08.366
It's your backbone people
are concerned about.

30:08.402 --> 30:09.402
Bulldog spirit.

30:09.438 --> 30:10.542
Enough of that crap, Robert.

30:10.578 --> 30:12.070
the security team are
taking a look outside

30:12.106 --> 30:14.005
and if they say it isn't safe,
it isn't safe,

30:14.041 --> 30:16.526
and you are not going outside, end of.

30:17.426 --> 30:19.064
Did you just say, "End of"?

30:20.205 --> 30:22.154
OK, yeah, but the point stands.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.330
I mean it.

30:25.513 --> 30:27.389
They're ready for us on the wards.

30:28.680 --> 30:29.720
Mm-hm.

30:34.848 --> 30:37.287
I wish you all the very, very best
for a speedy recovery.

30:37.323 --> 30:38.323
Isabella's just round here, sir.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.950
Isabella's just round here, sir.

30:42.951 --> 30:45.836
Isabella. Are you up for a visit?

30:46.325 --> 30:47.616
How are you feeling?

30:49.419 --> 30:50.577
Better?

30:52.893 --> 30:56.778
I understand
that Chief Constable Collier here

30:57.290 --> 31:00.305
rescued you and your baby
from the wreckage.

31:00.341 --> 31:02.710
Yes. Thank you.

31:04.132 --> 31:06.722
The doctors tell me you will walk again.

31:08.270 --> 31:09.540
- I think so.
- That's good.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.912
- It's a no go.
- Thanks, Mike.

31:11.386 --> 31:13.986
It's a definite no, thank God.

31:26.510 --> 31:27.915
You came this far.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.614
You didn't turn on your heel
or anything.

31:29.650 --> 31:32.253
- Do you think that's how it'll look?
- Listen to them outside!

31:33.070 --> 31:34.482
Bring him out!

31:34.518 --> 31:36.173
Archie's going over the top soon.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.693
That was just some preliminary shelling.

31:38.961 --> 31:40.681
- Probably.
- I should sack him.

31:43.470 --> 31:44.550
Not yet.

31:47.621 --> 31:50.906
The doctors have said you can go up
to Kemal Hussain's bedside, sir,

31:50.942 --> 31:52.342
but he won't be able to speak.

31:53.025 --> 31:54.490
Oh, God.

31:55.572 --> 31:57.655
Come on. This is still important.

32:01.230 --> 32:02.670
All right. No press.

32:03.989 --> 32:05.229
Bring him out!

32:30.890 --> 32:31.998
I'm uh...

32:33.710 --> 32:35.510
I'm so very sorry this happened.

32:40.424 --> 32:44.264
I like your doll. Does she have a name?

32:45.150 --> 32:46.310
Dolly.

32:47.550 --> 32:51.870
My daughter called
her favourite doll John.

32:54.196 --> 32:55.748
Could not talk her out of it.

32:56.690 --> 32:58.430
They hurt my daddy.

33:19.270 --> 33:23.155
Robert. No! No!

33:23.190 --> 33:25.014
Get out of my way. Robert!

33:25.492 --> 33:27.354
It's for your own security!

33:27.390 --> 33:29.350
You have to let these people
do their job.

33:37.750 --> 33:38.870
Robert!

33:42.350 --> 33:43.510
Could you pl...

33:54.395 --> 33:57.507
- I know you're angry...
- Yes, and when I'm very, very angry,

33:57.543 --> 34:00.548
I become totally oblivious
to any other consideration.

34:00.584 --> 34:03.657
- Yes, I do know that, but...
- No fucking buts.

34:04.550 --> 34:06.750
We have to show our face
at times like this.

34:27.429 --> 34:29.315
Get them off him! Get them off him!

34:29.350 --> 34:30.635
Fuck off!

34:56.790 --> 34:58.310
Give me the mike. Come on.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.830
Give me the mike.

35:10.070 --> 35:11.195
Please!

35:13.070 --> 35:16.835
There are people inside that hospital
working around the clock

35:16.870 --> 35:19.908
to try and resolve this situation.

35:19.944 --> 35:22.275
Not politicians like me,

35:22.798 --> 35:25.595
but people who do a hard job
for very little reward,

35:25.630 --> 35:28.370
because they believe in public service.

35:30.070 --> 35:34.435
Now, the man inside that hospital
is not the man you think it is.

35:34.470 --> 35:36.710
His name is Kemal Hussain.

35:37.610 --> 35:40.850
He has vitiligo,
and he is an innocent man.

35:41.769 --> 35:44.254
Now, he also has a beautiful daughter,

35:44.375 --> 35:45.881
who's just asked me,

35:46.662 --> 35:50.075
why is her daddy lying in a hospital
bed with his head smashed in.

35:50.110 --> 35:51.475
Cos he's a rapist!

35:51.510 --> 35:56.230
Now, the people who did that
are not some kind of guardian angels,

35:57.190 --> 35:59.035
they are lawless thugs,

35:59.487 --> 36:02.398
and such crimes will not go unpunished

36:03.016 --> 36:04.669
while I am still Prime Minister.

36:05.830 --> 36:09.515
There is no justice
but the law in this country.

36:09.550 --> 36:10.564
Yeah!

36:11.540 --> 36:13.986
Now, at times like this...

36:16.870 --> 36:20.124
If you're gonna throw things, please
maybe try and aim a little better.

36:22.243 --> 36:27.195
At times like this, it is usual
to say, "I feel your pain."

36:29.190 --> 36:30.555
Empathy, right?

36:30.875 --> 36:34.803
All the best politicians
are meant to feel it, to show it.

36:35.550 --> 36:37.715
Well, I don't feel your pain.

36:39.190 --> 36:41.520
No, no, no. How can I?

36:43.310 --> 36:46.995
I can only try and do
something about it.

36:47.030 --> 36:50.628
Now, I can tell you that the
super-transformer has left Germany

36:51.070 --> 36:55.115
and we are working day and night
to try and bring it to you.

36:55.150 --> 36:56.790
And we will bring it to you.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.750
I promise you that right here and now.

37:00.378 --> 37:04.710
We will bring back power,
we will turn the lights on again.

37:11.110 --> 37:15.796
Let this situation bring out
the best in us rather than the worst.

37:15.975 --> 37:19.928
And to those who try to exploit
this situation for their own ends,

37:20.070 --> 37:21.675
from the vigilantes,

37:21.864 --> 37:24.589
to the charlatans
who try to make political capital

37:24.625 --> 37:26.275
out of the suffering of others,

37:27.024 --> 37:28.435
I say this.

37:28.948 --> 37:30.892
There will be a reckoning.

37:33.238 --> 37:37.675
I promise you,
we will turn the lights on again!

37:39.950 --> 37:41.030
Thank you.

38:01.080 --> 38:04.275
When? That's all we want to know.
When is this gonna be over?

38:04.310 --> 38:07.475
Unfortunately, moving and installing
such massive equipment

38:07.510 --> 38:09.235
is proving very difficult.

38:09.604 --> 38:12.350
I'm sorry, but we are doing
our utmost to bring it to you.

38:13.233 --> 38:15.918
At least you came, showed your face.

38:16.070 --> 38:20.041
Thank you very, very much.
Thank you very much, indeed.

38:20.270 --> 38:21.310
Thank you.

38:22.819 --> 38:24.379
Thanks, everyone. Thank you.

38:35.910 --> 38:38.870
- You should feel better.
- Thanks. Thank you.

39:09.150 --> 39:12.635
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, it's... it's nothing.

39:12.670 --> 39:14.194
It just grazed
the side of my head, really.

39:14.284 --> 39:15.856
How many fingers am I holding up?

39:17.993 --> 39:19.188
Friday?

39:20.810 --> 39:22.010
You ready to go?

39:24.217 --> 39:26.781
I've ordered a helicopter
to take you back to London.

39:27.279 --> 39:29.155
Robert, it's not necessary.
It's a scratch.

39:29.190 --> 39:30.435
Non-negotiable.

39:30.470 --> 39:33.275
I want you checked out
in a properly-functioning hospital.

39:33.775 --> 39:35.435
Is Sam home?

39:35.743 --> 39:37.915
Yeah, but I'm borrowing
Madeleine Cook's flat,

39:37.950 --> 39:39.683
she's in her constituency.

39:40.242 --> 39:41.557
See you back in London.

39:45.844 --> 39:48.089
- Chief Constable, thank you so much.
- Thank you.

39:48.125 --> 39:49.170
Take care.

39:49.669 --> 39:52.820
Were you referring to the Home Secretary
or Harry Rowntree out there?

39:52.856 --> 39:54.840
I was referring to anyone who uses

39:54.876 --> 39:56.954
this crisis for their own selfish ends.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.315
Archie is Archie.

39:58.350 --> 40:01.139
He shoots from the hip, straight
at his own foot most of the time.

40:01.175 --> 40:03.980
- You can't sack him, can you?
- I've got bigger things to think of

40:04.016 --> 40:05.339
than cabinet reshuffles today.
Thank you.

40:05.375 --> 40:07.458
- Like your daughter's police interview?
- All right. That'll do.

40:07.494 --> 40:09.019
Thank you very much, everybody.

40:09.727 --> 40:13.312
I think there's enough lynch mobs
running around right now.

40:13.403 --> 40:16.248
Perhaps we should let due process
take its course.

40:16.510 --> 40:17.910
Real classy, Jane. Well done.

40:45.830 --> 40:46.995
Goodnight, Dad.

40:47.030 --> 40:49.515
The Prime Minister's Chief of Staff,
Anna Marshall,

40:49.550 --> 40:51.989
has been discharged from hospital
after being hit by a stone

40:52.025 --> 40:54.030
as Robert Sutherland addressed the crowd

40:54.066 --> 40:55.911
at an emergency relief centre.

40:55.947 --> 40:59.232
The large crowd amassed outside
the Royal Northumberland Hospital

40:59.268 --> 41:02.553
following an attack on one of
its relief camp's residents,

41:02.589 --> 41:04.573
Kemal Hussain.

41:04.710 --> 41:08.115
The Prime Minister also stopped
at the M1 secure checkpoint,

41:08.150 --> 41:11.035
where he met members
of the Local Resilience Forum

41:11.070 --> 41:14.710
and British soldiers tasked with
manning the zonal divide.

42:05.430 --> 42:07.152
Come away with me.

42:09.470 --> 42:11.790
I have a house in the hills
outside Mostar.

42:18.729 --> 42:21.714
I don't know if you've noticed, but...

42:21.750 --> 42:23.836
There's no internet connection.

42:25.270 --> 42:27.275
Only fig trees in the garden,

42:27.310 --> 42:31.190
where you can sit and...
read books, drink wine.

42:40.790 --> 42:43.875
I have children,
I have a job that I love.

42:43.910 --> 42:46.650
I'm not that young girl
out of university chasing wars.

42:46.983 --> 42:48.799
You are exactly the same to me.

42:48.835 --> 42:51.284
Yeah, because I haven't had
the chance to become anything else.

42:54.710 --> 42:57.875
Believe me, within a year you'd be
affectionately thumping my arse

42:57.910 --> 43:00.310
and asking me to warm
the milk for your coffee.

43:00.903 --> 43:02.148
How dare you!

43:03.204 --> 43:04.675
I would never ask for milk in my coffee.

43:08.290 --> 43:10.482
I need water, I need water!

43:27.590 --> 43:28.750
Anna?
