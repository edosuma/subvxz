NARRATOR: <i>Kids, this is</i>
<i>the story of the night</i>

00:04.016 --> 00:05.925
<i>Barney's life</i>
<i>completely fell apart.</i>

00:06.610 --> 00:08.327
My life is finally perfect,

00:08.329 --> 00:10.245
and that is never
going to change.

00:10.247 --> 00:12.314
Fired up for dinner
with my mom tonight?

00:12.316 --> 00:14.082
Yeah. To help streamline
the rest of our lives,

00:14.084 --> 00:16.868
you can always assume my answer
to that question is no.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.837
W...
I'm pretty nervous.

00:18.839 --> 00:21.290
Nervous? Why?
It's just gonna be two hours

00:21.292 --> 00:24.593
of "I love Barney the most."
"No, I love Barney the most."

00:24.595 --> 00:26.795
You're right. I may not even
get a chance to talk.

00:26.797 --> 00:27.829
But I'm still--

00:27.831 --> 00:29.047
I-I don't know. I'm worried

00:29.049 --> 00:30.716
she won't think
I'm good enough to be engaged

00:30.718 --> 00:32.683
to her precious
little Love-Love.

00:32.686 --> 00:35.687
Okay, first of all,
it's "Wuv-Wuv."

00:35.689 --> 00:36.504
And second,

00:36.506 --> 00:37.839
don't worry.

00:37.841 --> 00:39.224
I'm just gonna drop off
our catering deposit,

00:39.226 --> 00:40.892
and then I will be there for you.
Mm.

00:40.894 --> 00:42.277
Okay, well,
please don't be late.

00:42.279 --> 00:43.562
I am counting on you tonight.

00:43.564 --> 00:45.731
And be careful--
that's 5,000 bucks in there.

00:45.733 --> 00:49.034
Uh, I think I'll be okay
walking four blocks here

00:49.036 --> 00:51.620
on the Upper East Side.
(chuckles)

00:56.326 --> 00:57.909
(grunting)

00:57.911 --> 01:00.362
Please, I swear I never talked
to the North Koreans!

01:00.364 --> 01:01.696
Unless you are
the North Koreans, in which case

01:01.698 --> 01:02.881
I never talked
to the South Koreans!

01:02.883 --> 01:04.498
MAN (menacingly):
Barney Stinson,

01:04.501 --> 01:06.885
you are being
kidnapped.

01:06.887 --> 01:09.871
For your surprise
bachelor party!

01:09.873 --> 01:11.873

01:24.687 --> 01:26.355
A kidnapping.

01:26.357 --> 01:27.489
Respect.

01:27.491 --> 01:28.740
I was secretly worried

01:28.742 --> 01:31.559
you might not be able
to pull off my bachelor party.

01:31.561 --> 01:33.328
Yeah, it wasn't that secret.

01:33.330 --> 01:35.730
You two?
Planning <i>my</i> bachelor party?

01:35.732 --> 01:38.250
(chuckles)
Look, you seem like nice kids.

01:38.252 --> 01:40.168
But this is a sacred event,

01:40.170 --> 01:42.621
a man's rite of passage
with his bros.

01:42.623 --> 01:45.257
His... bro mitzvah!

01:45.259 --> 01:46.508
You didn't just
think of that.

01:46.510 --> 01:47.759
You've been saying it
for months every...

01:47.761 --> 01:49.094
But here's my dilemma:

01:49.096 --> 01:51.346
my average night is like
an average guy's bachelor party.

01:51.348 --> 01:53.382
So, no offense,
but if you two plan it,

01:53.384 --> 01:56.251
it's gonna be ordi--
why wait for it?-- nary.

01:56.253 --> 01:57.769
Ordinary.

01:57.771 --> 01:58.520
I can help.

01:58.522 --> 02:00.138
You?
(chuckles)

02:00.140 --> 02:01.890
Look, you seem like a nice kid,

02:01.892 --> 02:02.858
but bros' fiancées

02:02.860 --> 02:04.376
cannot plan bachelor parties.

02:04.378 --> 02:05.927
Sorry. You two are on your own.

02:05.929 --> 02:07.863
And you will disappoint me.

02:08.781 --> 02:10.949
But make it great, okay?

02:10.951 --> 02:13.235
But this is a strong start.

02:13.237 --> 02:15.603
The students
have become...

02:15.605 --> 02:17.939
the intermediate
students.

02:17.941 --> 02:20.442
I just have
to make one call.

02:22.045 --> 02:23.445
(phone rings)
Hello.

02:23.447 --> 02:24.880
Robin, great news!

02:24.882 --> 02:26.748
I've been kidnapped
for a surprise bachelor party

02:26.750 --> 02:28.383
so I won't be there
at all!

02:28.385 --> 02:31.136
What? Barney, I-I can't
do dinner with your mom alone.

02:31.138 --> 02:33.922
Okay, I'll call her,
make up an excuse and cancel.

02:33.924 --> 02:35.924
And don't worry,
I'll take all the blame.

02:35.926 --> 02:38.310
Hold on.

02:38.312 --> 02:39.428
Hi, Wuv-Wuv.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.896
Hi, Momsies.

02:40.898 --> 02:43.849
I forgot, I'm mentoring an
underprivileged child tonight,

02:43.851 --> 02:47.469
and Robin can't stand the idea
of dinner with you by herself,

02:47.471 --> 02:49.104
so we're not gonna be able to...

02:49.106 --> 02:50.472
Don't bother.
She's already here.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.741
Hold on.

02:52.743 --> 02:55.277
Robin? Too late.
She's already there.

02:55.279 --> 02:56.661
Barney, don't...

02:56.663 --> 02:59.581
Robin can't stand the idea
of dinner with me?

02:59.583 --> 03:00.982
Great! We're all set then.

03:00.984 --> 03:02.684
Don't you leave me alone
with her. I told you...

03:02.686 --> 03:05.320
That problem is solved.

03:05.322 --> 03:07.038
So what's the plan?

03:07.040 --> 03:09.157
Well, you know the Taj
Mahal in Atlantic City?

03:09.159 --> 03:11.126
Yeah.

03:11.128 --> 03:13.044
You know the
secret penthouse

03:13.046 --> 03:15.830
in the top of the Taj
Mahal in Atlantic City?

03:15.832 --> 03:18.049
Yeah!

03:18.051 --> 03:19.885
Boom! There it is.

03:19.887 --> 03:21.720
Visible from our window.

03:21.722 --> 03:24.005
In the distance.

03:24.007 --> 03:25.107
Behind the refinery.

03:25.109 --> 03:26.892
Okay, you can't
quite see it.

03:26.894 --> 03:29.811
Why are we outside
Atlantic City?

03:29.813 --> 03:31.396
Well, we thought it was best,

03:31.398 --> 03:34.366
what with your weakness
for games of chance.

03:34.368 --> 03:35.750
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, Barney was addicted</i>

03:35.752 --> 03:37.235
<i>to one Chinese gambling game</i>

03:37.237 --> 03:40.322
<i>that was, well,</i>
<i>sort of complicated.</i>

03:40.324 --> 03:41.356
But don't worry.

03:41.358 --> 03:43.074
Back when you were
engaged to Quinn,

03:43.076 --> 03:45.877
you told us everything
you wanted for tonight.

03:45.879 --> 03:48.830
A bachelor party is a man's...

03:48.832 --> 03:51.533
bro mitzvah!

03:51.535 --> 03:53.051
Did you just think of that?

03:53.053 --> 03:55.303
Totally! We can wear...

03:55.305 --> 03:57.305
bro-mulkes...

03:57.307 --> 04:01.309
spin the bro-del...

04:01.311 --> 04:03.845
and consult the wisdom

04:03.847 --> 04:06.982
of the <i>Bro-rah.</i>

04:06.984 --> 04:10.202
Written in... He-bro.

04:10.204 --> 04:12.521
Not at all
bro-ffensive.

04:12.523 --> 04:15.023
Ooh, ooh! Couple other ideas--
and I'm just spitballing here--

04:15.025 --> 04:16.575
so take 'em or leave 'em.

04:16.577 --> 04:19.494
Booze, duh; cigars, duh;
strippers, duh...

04:19.495 --> 04:21.245
Ooh! Things should get so
crazy that at some point

04:21.248 --> 04:22.931
we should fear
for our lives.

04:22.933 --> 04:25.617
Oh, we'll fear for our lives,
all right.

04:25.619 --> 04:29.421
When we watch Al Gore's
<i>An Inconvenient Truth!</i>

04:29.423 --> 04:30.905
(chuckles) Yeah. We're
gonna pound a beer

04:30.907 --> 04:32.123
every time we
hear the word

04:32.125 --> 04:33.741
(imitates Al Gore):
"catastrophic""

04:33.743 --> 04:35.410
(knocking)
Oh!

04:35.412 --> 04:37.245
Could that be...

04:37.247 --> 04:40.432
the next item on your list?

04:40.434 --> 04:42.551
BARNEY: Mind-blowing
entertainment,

04:42.553 --> 04:46.388
like a naked fire show
or a naked magic show.

04:46.390 --> 04:47.556
There's a good chance
our engagement

04:47.558 --> 04:48.640
doesn't work out, isn't there?

04:48.642 --> 04:49.474
Not now, honey.

04:49.476 --> 04:51.926
Or a naked
contortionist!

04:51.928 --> 04:55.146
Or... a balloon contortionist!

04:55.148 --> 04:57.199
(honking)

04:58.934 --> 05:00.318
Balloons.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.937
Not the inflatable, round,
squishy pouches

05:02.939 --> 05:04.623
I was hoping to see tonight.

05:04.625 --> 05:05.874
(cell phone ringing)

05:05.876 --> 05:06.958
Hold on.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.610
TED (quietly):
I told you no clown.

05:08.612 --> 05:11.379
Well, you didn't like
the bubble guy either.

05:11.381 --> 05:12.214
Hey, Robin.

05:12.216 --> 05:13.381
Did you tell your mother

05:13.383 --> 05:14.449
I'm a virgin?

05:14.451 --> 05:17.335
What? Why would you think that?

05:17.337 --> 05:19.721
Save yourself room for dessert.
Mmm.

05:19.723 --> 05:22.974
And I hear you excel
at saving yourself.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.428
(chuckles):
You are so funny.

05:26.430 --> 05:27.846
What's gotten into you?

05:27.848 --> 05:30.982
Oh, that's right-- nothing ever.

05:32.985 --> 05:34.302
You may be nervous

05:34.304 --> 05:36.905
as to what goes where
on your wedding night.

05:36.907 --> 05:38.607
It's really simple.

05:38.609 --> 05:40.808
Let me show you.

05:42.978 --> 05:46.081
Let's start with
the fundamentals.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.149
Why would you
tell her I'm a virgin?

05:48.151 --> 05:49.084
I panicked.

05:49.086 --> 05:50.818
Look, I really want her
to like you,

05:50.820 --> 05:52.704
so just go with it, okay? Okay!

05:52.706 --> 05:54.623
Listen, Wuv-Wuv,
you better get your ass back...

05:55.608 --> 05:56.658
(knocking)

05:56.660 --> 05:58.009
Another guest?

05:58.011 --> 06:00.662
Who could this be?

06:01.380 --> 06:02.430
Why, it's Lily!

06:02.432 --> 06:03.665
And she's here
to deliver

06:03.667 --> 06:04.683
one of your requests!

06:04.685 --> 06:06.968
Oh, thank you,
Marshall.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.270
Oh, not that one.

06:08.272 --> 06:10.972
An appearance by
my all-time idol,

06:10.974 --> 06:13.024
the Karate Kid!

06:13.026 --> 06:15.009
NARRATOR: The Karate Kid
<i>was an uplifting '80s classic</i>

06:15.011 --> 06:17.145
<i>about a teen,</i>
<i>played by Ralph Macchio,</i>

06:17.147 --> 06:20.365
<i>who defeats the local jerk,</i>
<i>played by William Zabka.</i>

06:20.367 --> 06:22.734
<i>At least, that's how</i>
<i>most people saw it.</i>

06:22.736 --> 06:24.653
Here he is, just as hot

06:24.655 --> 06:28.123
as when his <i>Tiger Beat</i>
photo spread gave a young girl

06:28.125 --> 06:29.324
the courage to explore

06:29.326 --> 06:31.710
the suddenly unfamiliar
topography

06:31.712 --> 06:34.245
of her changing body...

06:34.247 --> 06:37.666
the Karate Kid!

06:37.668 --> 06:38.967
Hey, Barney. It's Ralph.

06:38.969 --> 06:40.302
Listen,
it's always flattering...

06:40.304 --> 06:41.553
No!

06:42.471 --> 06:43.871
I hate Ralph Macchio!

06:43.873 --> 06:46.174
I hate him, hate him, hate him!

06:46.176 --> 06:48.209
He is not the Karate Kid!

06:48.211 --> 06:50.395
The Karate Kid
was William Zabka,

06:50.397 --> 06:53.064
star pupil
of the Cobra Kai Dojo,

06:53.066 --> 06:54.599
who this monster

06:54.601 --> 06:55.600
defeated
with a cheap,

06:55.602 --> 06:57.885
<i>illegal</i> head-kick

06:57.887 --> 07:03.108
in the most tragically haunting
film ending of all time.

07:03.110 --> 07:06.161
Oh, see, I thought
you meant fun-crazy.

07:06.163 --> 07:07.729
Shut it, Ralph Macchio.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.781
Why don't you go have
a party with Luke Skywalker

07:09.783 --> 07:13.401
and Harry Potter and War Horse
and all the other movie bad guys

07:13.403 --> 07:16.538
and stop ruining mine!

07:16.540 --> 07:19.073
This night has been
catastrophic.

07:19.075 --> 07:21.743
"Catastrophic"!
Everybody pound.

07:22.678 --> 07:23.762
Sorry, bro.

07:23.764 --> 07:24.713
I'm staying.

07:24.715 --> 07:26.131
If this is anything

07:26.133 --> 07:27.749
like my bachelor party--
strippers, booze,

07:27.751 --> 07:29.267
definitely no hand stuff--
wink-wink--

07:29.269 --> 07:33.021
it is gonna be in--
wait for it-- credible.

07:33.023 --> 07:34.055
Incredible!

07:34.057 --> 07:34.973
TED:
Wow.

07:34.975 --> 07:36.591
You guys are
actually a lot alike.

07:36.593 --> 07:37.642
You take that back, sir!

07:37.644 --> 07:41.429
I am nothing like
Ralph Macchio!

07:41.431 --> 07:44.315
I mean, did you guys
even <i>get</i> a stripper?

07:44.317 --> 07:45.483
Bro.
(chuckling)

07:45.485 --> 07:46.735
Bro.

07:46.737 --> 07:48.436
Of course we
got a stripper.

07:48.438 --> 07:50.538
Do we look like
the kind of dweebs

07:50.540 --> 07:52.457
who wouldn't get a stripper?
(scoffs)

07:52.459 --> 07:54.442
(knocking)

07:54.444 --> 07:55.460
And as the saying goes,

07:55.462 --> 07:57.078
what happens in
the sensibly-priced

07:57.080 --> 07:59.280
business hotel outside
Atlantic City stays

07:59.282 --> 08:02.283
in the sensibly-priced business
hotel outside Atlantic City.

08:04.119 --> 08:05.620
Who is it?

08:05.622 --> 08:07.789
WOMAN: Police. We got
a noise complaint from...

08:07.791 --> 08:10.842
Oh, who am I kidding?
I can tell it's dead in there.

08:10.844 --> 08:13.011
I'm the stripper!

08:14.963 --> 08:16.931
Barney?

08:16.933 --> 08:18.266
Quinn?

08:24.347 --> 08:27.375
This is your bachelor party?
You're engaged again,

08:27.376 --> 08:29.660
less than a year
after we broke up?

08:29.662 --> 08:31.446
Is it Robin?

08:31.448 --> 08:32.630
Now, hold on.

08:32.631 --> 08:35.900
You're not the only one
with questions here.

08:35.902 --> 08:38.251
You didn't vet the stripper?!

08:39.121 --> 08:40.304
Well, I'm glad
you're so happy.

08:40.306 --> 08:42.590
After we broke up,
I had to move out of the city,

08:42.592 --> 08:44.792
my car got totaled,
and I had to go back

08:44.794 --> 08:46.127
to stripping just to pay rent.

08:46.129 --> 08:49.897
It's like everywhere I look,
my life is a dead-end.

08:49.899 --> 08:51.983
Wow.

08:51.985 --> 08:55.302
I am... I'm so
sorry, Quinn.

08:55.304 --> 08:56.637
So, how does this work?

08:56.639 --> 08:58.823
Do you give me a private
show, or does everyone...?

08:58.825 --> 09:01.192
I am not stripping for you.

09:01.194 --> 09:02.977
Whoa, whoa! I was
promised boobs.

09:02.979 --> 09:04.112
Oh, Ralph,
if you want, I can...

09:04.114 --> 09:05.663
Lily.

09:05.665 --> 09:06.480
Is that the Karate Kid?

09:06.482 --> 09:07.331
Yes! Yes!
Yes!

09:07.333 --> 09:08.282
No!

09:08.284 --> 09:09.333
He's a lot like
Barney, huh?

09:09.335 --> 09:10.868
(gasps) You take
that back, madam.

09:10.870 --> 09:13.454
I am nothing
like Ralph Macchio!

09:13.456 --> 09:14.756
QUINN:
Okay, okay.

09:14.758 --> 09:15.840
I'll tell you what.

09:15.842 --> 09:18.126
I am going to strip
for everyone here

09:18.128 --> 09:20.628
except Barney.

09:20.630 --> 09:22.764
And I'm gonna make it dirty.

09:22.766 --> 09:25.550
Yeah, um, I'm the bachelor.

09:25.552 --> 09:28.186
Kind of no stripping
without the lap of honor.

09:28.188 --> 09:29.837
Back me up, bros.

09:30.889 --> 09:32.557
(people whooping,
dance music playing)

09:32.559 --> 09:33.691
(phone ringing)

09:33.693 --> 09:34.942
MARSHALL:
How'd you even do that?

09:34.944 --> 09:36.677
TED: What the...?!
LILY: Oh, my God, yeah!

09:36.679 --> 09:38.196
Hey, Robin.

09:38.198 --> 09:40.347
Hey, sweetie, having fun
at your bachelor party?

09:40.349 --> 09:43.151
No.
Good, 'cause my night's been hell!

09:43.153 --> 09:45.787
And that's the inverted
chimney sweep,

09:45.789 --> 09:48.739
the last of the 17 basic
sexual positions.

09:48.741 --> 09:49.907
Now, bondage...

09:49.909 --> 09:52.026
Stop! I'm not a virgin!

09:52.028 --> 09:54.162
My napkin ring has seen
plenty of breadsticks.

09:54.663 --> 09:56.547
And one baguette.

09:56.549 --> 09:58.166
I dated a center for the Knicks.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.885
Oh, thank God
you're not a prude.

10:00.887 --> 10:03.037
Now we can really talk.

10:03.039 --> 10:05.206
Four cosmos, pronto!

10:05.208 --> 10:06.507
Now she's drunk,

10:06.509 --> 10:08.810
holding up a napkin ring
and three breadsticks,

10:08.812 --> 10:11.429
and talking about her night
with Crosby, Stills and Nash.

10:11.431 --> 10:13.681
Waiter, can I have
another breadstick?

10:13.683 --> 10:14.649
And Young.

10:14.651 --> 10:16.234
Please come back.

10:16.236 --> 10:18.152
(people cheering)
Okay.

10:18.154 --> 10:20.822
I'll be there soon.

10:20.824 --> 10:22.190
Real nice.
So beautiful.

10:22.192 --> 10:23.774
I think we really did it.
I think we did it, you know?

10:23.776 --> 10:25.860
You didn't miss a thing.

10:25.862 --> 10:27.245
MARSHALL: Oh, Quinn?
Yeah?

10:27.247 --> 10:30.414
You got a little...
something.

10:30.416 --> 10:32.583
Oh! Oh.

10:34.419 --> 10:36.537
(sighs)

10:36.539 --> 10:37.905
Let's head back, guys.

10:37.907 --> 10:40.241
This night has been
completely half-assed.

10:40.243 --> 10:41.575
You obviously missed
the strip show.

10:41.577 --> 10:43.244
Hey-oh!
(horn honks)

10:43.246 --> 10:45.596
Ted, this was my bachelor party.

10:45.598 --> 10:49.050
A man only gets two or three
of these in his lifetime.

10:49.052 --> 10:51.252
And this is all you do for me?

10:51.254 --> 10:53.187
That's it, I'm calling it.

10:53.189 --> 10:55.439
Who needs a ride back
to the city?

10:57.192 --> 10:58.142
Oh.

10:58.144 --> 11:00.194
Oh, guys, wait,
hold on, hold on.

11:01.930 --> 11:03.264
Drinking.

11:03.932 --> 11:04.866
A shot.

11:06.268 --> 11:07.601
Shooting.

11:07.603 --> 11:08.703
A gun.

11:09.705 --> 11:11.072
Shot, gun.

11:11.074 --> 11:12.273
Shotgun?

11:12.275 --> 11:13.291
(sighs)

11:13.293 --> 11:15.576
Man, it's crowded
in here.

11:15.578 --> 11:18.296
I know,
it's like a clown car.

11:18.298 --> 11:20.614
Well, I can make some room
by grinding on Ralph's lap.

11:20.616 --> 11:21.632
ing!

11:21.634 --> 11:22.917
I-I meant, I meant sitting.

11:22.919 --> 11:25.753
This is the worst
bachelor party ever.

11:25.755 --> 11:29.891
Man, my bachelor party
was incr-- wait for it--

11:29.893 --> 11:31.142
and I hope you're hungry,

11:31.144 --> 11:34.345
'cause the second half
of this word is-- edible!

11:34.347 --> 11:35.629
Incredible!

11:35.631 --> 11:37.732
(chuckles)
Self-shake.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.684
(gasps)

11:39.686 --> 11:41.135
You take that
back, clown.

11:41.137 --> 11:43.237
I am nothing like Ralph Macchio!

11:43.239 --> 11:44.355
RALPH:
Yeah.

11:44.357 --> 11:45.990
You've got more in
common with the clown,

11:45.992 --> 11:47.141
except his suit's
more expensive.

11:47.143 --> 11:48.142
Hey, yo!

11:48.144 --> 11:49.160
(horn honks)

11:49.162 --> 11:50.311
I mean, what kind of loser

11:50.313 --> 11:52.413
has his bachelor party
ten yards from A.C.

11:52.415 --> 11:54.115
and doesn't even gamble?

11:59.588 --> 12:01.155
(tires screeching)

12:01.157 --> 12:02.990
(screams)
Oh. Oh, sorry.

12:02.992 --> 12:05.710
Sorry. Sorry.

12:05.712 --> 12:07.545
(chuckles)
Sorry.

12:07.547 --> 12:08.930
Oh... oh, wait.

12:08.932 --> 12:09.931
Just a little more.

12:09.933 --> 12:11.349
Okay, sorry.

12:11.351 --> 12:12.633
(sighs):
Okay.

12:12.635 --> 12:15.036
(speaking Chinese)

12:15.038 --> 12:18.439
...bro mitzvah!
(laughs)

12:18.441 --> 12:20.524
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, I'll skip over</i>
<i>the gambling.</i>

12:20.526 --> 12:22.893
<i>Like I said, it was</i>
<i>a complicated game.</i>

12:22.895 --> 12:25.446
<i>Although your old man</i>
<i>did pick it up pretty quickly.</i>

12:25.448 --> 12:27.565
(crowd cheers)

12:27.567 --> 12:28.532
Hey!

12:28.534 --> 12:30.568
You just won 300 bucks!

12:30.570 --> 12:32.937
I just lost $5,000.

12:32.939 --> 12:34.438
Oh, right.
'Cause the chicken.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.690
Yep, that-that's
$5,000, yeah.

12:36.692 --> 12:38.659
(laughs)

12:38.661 --> 12:39.794
See, I'm laughing

12:39.796 --> 12:41.662
because you couldn't see me
take my top off,

12:41.664 --> 12:43.998
but I just saw you lose your shirt.
Hey-yo!

12:44.000 --> 12:45.683
(horn honks)
We have to go back.

12:45.685 --> 12:47.885
(sneezes): Loser!
Sorry, that was a real sneeze.

12:47.887 --> 12:50.388
Might have made you miss
what I was saying.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.422
Loser!

12:51.424 --> 12:53.040
(laughs):
Loser.

12:53.042 --> 12:54.708
We're not going anywhere.

12:54.710 --> 12:57.878
I can still make
this night legendary.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.897
Uh, uh... (speaks Chinese)

12:59.899 --> 13:01.983
(replies in Chinese)

13:01.985 --> 13:03.717
Oh, oh.

13:03.719 --> 13:06.354
Okay, I got some credit.

13:06.356 --> 13:08.222
I just... mm...

13:08.224 --> 13:09.774
Marshall, stand over there
for good luck?

13:09.776 --> 13:11.309
Oh, sure.

13:15.947 --> 13:17.731
Okay, okay.

13:17.733 --> 13:20.251
(crowd chants in Chinese)

13:20.253 --> 13:21.669
(speaks Chinese)

13:22.838 --> 13:24.672
(crowd cheers)

13:24.674 --> 13:27.408
(laughs):
Oh! Oh!

13:27.410 --> 13:30.378
You crazy son of a bitch,
you did it!

13:30.380 --> 13:33.097
I just lost $80,000.

13:33.099 --> 13:34.849
Oh, right, right, yeah.
'Cause the black jelly bean.

13:34.851 --> 13:36.183
That-That's $80,000.
He's right.

13:36.185 --> 13:37.968
(clears throat)

13:37.970 --> 13:40.438
You know, Ralph,

13:40.440 --> 13:44.425
earlier at the salon, I
waxed on, then waxed off.

13:44.427 --> 13:46.260
(whispers):
Everywhere.

13:46.262 --> 13:49.363
Uh, listen, lady,
your husband is, like...

13:49.365 --> 13:51.649
Hey, where <i>is</i>
your husband?

13:51.651 --> 13:52.783
Marshall?

13:52.785 --> 13:54.068
Where's Marshall?!

13:54.070 --> 13:57.872
Okay, Lily,
don't overreact, but...

14:01.376 --> 14:02.576
Oh, oh.

14:02.578 --> 14:04.795
Okay, I got some credit.

14:04.797 --> 14:06.914
Marshall, stand over there
for good luck?

14:06.916 --> 14:09.083
Oh, sure.

14:12.787 --> 14:14.839
You sold my husband?!

14:14.841 --> 14:16.891
Lily, can you be more like
the Chinese mobster

14:16.893 --> 14:18.292
and give me some credit?

14:18.294 --> 14:21.562
I'm going back for Marshall;
I just need to get some money.

14:21.564 --> 14:24.598
You have nothing to worry about;
these are the "good" mobsters.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.234
Wow, what kind of bozo
does that to a friend?

14:27.236 --> 14:29.854
Shut it, Ralph Macchio!

14:29.856 --> 14:30.938
No, you shut it!

14:30.940 --> 14:34.358
Ralph Macchio's right,
you <i>are</i> a bozo.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.527
Um, I think they prefer
"people of bright color."

14:36.529 --> 14:38.145
You know what
a bachelor party's about?

14:38.147 --> 14:40.664
Hanging out with your friends
and having a good time.

14:40.666 --> 14:43.701
But you only care about
the good time, not the friends.

14:43.703 --> 14:44.818
So you know what?

14:44.820 --> 14:47.004
I'm-I'm done
caring about you then.

14:47.006 --> 14:48.489
I'm out of here.

14:48.491 --> 14:49.790
Ted...

14:51.659 --> 14:53.878
Ted, Ted, I have...

14:53.880 --> 14:56.347
I just tore your mom away
from a living version

14:56.349 --> 14:59.433
of a Nick Nolte mug shot
and put her in a cab home.

14:59.435 --> 15:01.001
Thank you for abandoning me

15:01.003 --> 15:03.771
on what has been one of
the worst nights of my life.

15:03.773 --> 15:06.173
So, it's my usual fee,
plus I always charge

15:06.175 --> 15:08.559
an extra hundred for
girl-on-clown action.

15:08.561 --> 15:10.978
What the hell
is she doing here?

15:10.980 --> 15:13.147
Robin, I swear,
nothing happened.

15:13.149 --> 15:14.899
That means just hand stuff.
(horn honks)

15:14.901 --> 15:17.034
You...!
Oh!

15:17.036 --> 15:20.871
No, no, stop, stop, stop!

15:20.873 --> 15:21.956
Sorry, Barney,

15:21.958 --> 15:25.876
this... this-this is
unforgivable.

15:25.878 --> 15:27.328
It's over.

15:29.548 --> 15:32.082
You know...

15:32.084 --> 15:34.034
I never got to do that.

15:35.887 --> 15:38.038
(sighs)

15:42.060 --> 15:43.644
(sighs)

15:43.646 --> 15:45.212
Ted?

15:45.214 --> 15:47.014
Robin.

15:47.016 --> 15:49.817
We're right on schedule.

15:53.574 --> 15:55.665
Barney is suicidal.
I know, it's awesome!

15:55.666 --> 15:56.721
(both laughing)

15:56.722 --> 15:58.389
NARRATOR:
<i>Yep, kids, we had planned out</i>

15:58.391 --> 15:59.757
<i>every step of the night.</i>

15:59.759 --> 16:01.792
It started three weeks earlier.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.811
...and you will disappoint me.

16:04.813 --> 16:06.931
But make it great, okay?

16:06.933 --> 16:08.983
Oh, it'll be great,
all right!

16:08.985 --> 16:10.868
Okay, after two weeks
of brainstorming,

16:10.870 --> 16:13.320
all I have on my list
so far is Purell.

16:13.322 --> 16:14.855
Marshall, what
do you got?

16:14.857 --> 16:17.107
Well, nothing <i>now.</i>

16:17.109 --> 16:18.626
This is impossible!

16:18.628 --> 16:20.744
How do you make something
memorable for a guy

16:20.746 --> 16:22.997
who makes every night
the best night of his life?

16:22.999 --> 16:26.400
Give him the worst night
of his life.

16:26.402 --> 16:30.371
<i>We'll give him</i>
<i>the worst hotel room</i>

16:30.373 --> 16:32.155
with the worst entertainment,
(horn honks)

16:32.157 --> 16:34.091
<i>the wrong Karate Kid,</i>

16:34.093 --> 16:37.327
and the absolute last stripper
he would want to see.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.512
Hold on.

16:38.514 --> 16:40.764
You want me to pretend
my life's gone to crap

16:40.766 --> 16:43.333
and I'm back to stripping
just screw with my ex-fiancé?

16:44.102 --> 16:45.102
I love it!

16:46.254 --> 16:48.973
That party will be so terrible,
he'll have to leave it.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.676
<i>Then I'll instruct</i>
<i>his arch-nemesis to say...</i>

16:52.678 --> 16:55.029
I mean, what kind of loser
has his bachelor party

16:55.031 --> 16:57.531
ten yards from A.C.
and doesn't even gamble?

16:57.533 --> 16:59.867
ROBIN: <i>Barney will take</i>
<i>the envelope of cash I gave him</i>

16:59.869 --> 17:02.236
<i>and head straight</i>
<i>into our trap.</i>

17:02.238 --> 17:03.387
Hold on.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.489
You want us to rig a casino game

17:05.491 --> 17:07.574
to trick one of
our former high rollers?

17:07.576 --> 17:09.410
Um...

17:09.412 --> 17:10.243
I love it.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.878
Well, then
you get Barney

17:11.881 --> 17:14.196
to use one of these
guys as collateral.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.866
He'll probably choose me.
What?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.217
Well, I'd be worth more.

17:17.219 --> 17:18.935
Yeah. Perfect teeth.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.338
(clears throat)
Yeah, it's just, uh,

17:20.339 --> 17:22.056
just I'm <i>way</i> more athletic
than you.

17:22.058 --> 17:23.390
Yeah, this coming
from the guy

17:23.392 --> 17:25.392
who's never beaten me
at skee-ball.

17:25.394 --> 17:27.511
The only reason a mobster
might choose you is because

17:27.512 --> 17:29.880
they'd be afraid I'd go all
"Marshall Unchained" on them,

17:29.882 --> 17:31.382
which obviously isn't
a risk with you.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.401
Oh, you want to see
some "Ted Unchained," huh?

17:34.403 --> 17:36.236
I'll show you Ted Unchained!

17:37.238 --> 17:38.355
Marshall, would you mind

17:38.357 --> 17:39.890
standing over there
for good luck?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.659
Oh, yeah, sure.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.164
ROBIN:
<i>Meanwhile, I'll make sure</i>

17:47.166 --> 17:50.167
he's abandoned me
in my nightmare scenario.

17:50.169 --> 17:53.454
Hold on. You want me to
help you trick my own son?

17:54.456 --> 17:55.622
I love it.

17:55.624 --> 17:56.507
(sighs)

17:56.509 --> 17:57.508
Barney deserves it.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.710
You know, he told me
you were a virgin.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.462
(scoffs)
Ridiculous!

18:01.464 --> 18:02.513
I know.
(laughs)

18:02.515 --> 18:05.966
You are a dirty ho-bag
just like me.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.251
But he loves you so much.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.303
And so do I.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.755
(mouthing)

18:11.757 --> 18:13.590
Wait, hold on.
Is there any chance

18:13.592 --> 18:16.643
this is all too
mean to Barney?

18:17.645 --> 18:19.697
(laughter)

18:19.699 --> 18:21.331
Just kidding.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.150
Okay, we just need
the finale.

18:23.152 --> 18:25.319
Oh! The Chinese mobsters
chop off my hand

18:25.321 --> 18:26.870
right in front of Barney!

18:27.706 --> 18:29.907
Yes, we're all
equally enthused!

18:32.043 --> 18:34.044
Okay, here's the plan.
After I storm off...

18:34.046 --> 18:35.879
MARSHALL:
Barney!

18:35.881 --> 18:37.965
Barney, hurry!
Give them the money!

18:37.967 --> 18:39.833
Please, hurry!
Oh, no!

18:39.835 --> 18:41.802
The Chinese mobster
is giving Marshall back

18:41.804 --> 18:43.387
and taking me hostage instead,

18:43.389 --> 18:46.123
because he says
I'm obviously more valuable!

18:46.125 --> 18:48.008
Can you, can you
unlock the door?

18:48.010 --> 18:49.059
Barney, please!

18:49.061 --> 18:50.761
They're gonna
chop off my hand!

18:50.763 --> 18:51.795
No, they're not!

18:51.797 --> 18:53.296
They said you're free,
and I think

18:53.298 --> 18:55.399
we agreed that's not
something mobsters would do.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.234
Ted, come on!
This is my thing!

18:57.236 --> 18:58.402
Don't hurt him.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.570
I've got the money.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.988
Too late!

19:00.990 --> 19:02.906
(screaming)

19:03.942 --> 19:06.026
Not my skee-ball hand!

19:06.978 --> 19:08.695
No...!
No...!

19:08.697 --> 19:10.064
No!

19:11.816 --> 19:14.317
Please, just don't shoot me
in the face... or the crotch!

19:14.319 --> 19:16.670
ALL:
Surprise!

19:16.672 --> 19:19.206
What's going on?

19:19.208 --> 19:20.707
Well, we decided to give you

19:20.709 --> 19:23.093
everything you wanted
for your bachelor party

19:23.095 --> 19:25.162
without you even realizing it.

19:26.931 --> 19:29.883
Wait, so that's why you made me
think Marshall might die?

19:31.102 --> 19:33.670
And I'd lost all that money
and my friends hated me

19:33.672 --> 19:35.439
and my wedding was off?

19:35.441 --> 19:36.690
You just decided

19:36.692 --> 19:38.225
to-to check off

19:38.227 --> 19:40.394
everything on this list
in the most

19:40.396 --> 19:42.980
twisted way imaginable?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.365
That is awesome!

19:45.367 --> 19:48.535
And it was all planned
by a girl.

19:48.537 --> 19:49.620
(laughs):
Wow!

19:51.689 --> 19:54.124
So, Lily...

19:54.126 --> 19:56.076
later on tonight,
you want to, um...?

19:56.078 --> 19:58.295
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.664
That was all just
part of the act.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.382
Y-You knew that, right?

20:03.218 --> 20:04.802
Yeah! Totally.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.536
We pulled it off, right?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.038
Platonic shake!

20:14.078 --> 20:19.650
Everyone, everyone, thank you
for an incredible bro mitzvah.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.734
Mazel brov!

20:20.736 --> 20:22.552
ALL:
Mazel brov!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.404
(chuckles)

20:24.406 --> 20:26.607
Mm, oh, you didn't really get
everything on the list.

20:26.609 --> 20:27.574
N-No offense

20:27.576 --> 20:28.826
to Ralph Macchio,

20:28.828 --> 20:31.161
but he ain't the Karate Kid.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.113
I couldn't agree
with you more.

20:35.083 --> 20:38.085
You know,
they almost didn't get me.

20:39.838 --> 20:43.790
But after
18 voice mails...

20:43.792 --> 20:46.593
I returned Robin's call.

20:46.595 --> 20:47.961
And she told me

20:47.963 --> 20:50.848
how you're one of the
few people in the world

20:50.850 --> 20:53.100
who truly gets
<i>The Karate Kid</i> movie.

20:54.252 --> 20:57.938
So when she asked if I'd help,

20:57.940 --> 21:00.357
well, my answer
just had to be...

21:02.527 --> 21:04.311
Hai!

21:04.853 --> 21:07.153
William Zabka!
(all cheering)
