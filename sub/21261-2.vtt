WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:04.538
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
tech pioneer Darius Tanz.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.706
Sir, my name's Liam Cole.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.541
I'm a student at MIT.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.577
In 186 days, an asteroid's gonna
collide with Earth,

00:09.610 --> 00:11.512
and we're all gonna die.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.047
Previously on Salvation...

00:13.081 --> 00:14.382
What about you?
What important

00:14.415 --> 00:16.650
save-the-world work
are you doing at MIT?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.252
I'm creating a map of space.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.188
(phone buzzing)

00:20.221 --> 00:22.223
(knocking on door)
Professor Croft, it's Liam.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.625
There's something there that was
not there three months ago.
Really?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.227
COLE:
People need to see this
immediately.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.229
911? My professor,
he disappeared.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.830
I'm onto something
that someone, somewhere

00:29.863 --> 00:30.764
doesn't want public.

00:30.798 --> 00:31.832
The sky is falling,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.134
and you may be the only person

00:33.167 --> 00:34.535
that can do something about it.

00:34.568 --> 00:35.569
TANZ:
You run DOD point

00:35.603 --> 00:37.305
for all things NASA.
HARRIS:
Is there a problem?

00:37.338 --> 00:38.272
Depends on whether a
planet-killing asteroid

00:38.306 --> 00:39.773
is heading our way.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.342
HARRIS:
Grace Barrows,
DOD Public Affairs.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.576
You wanted to see me?

00:42.610 --> 00:44.812
Dr. Eduard Acosta
discovered an asteroid

00:44.845 --> 00:47.548
large enough to cause an
extinction-level event.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.816
TANZ:
So what is the plan?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.684
HARRIS:
A gravity tractor.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.753
That would deflect the asteroid
through gravitational pull.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.256
I'm sorry. I never wanted
to burden you with this.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.125
You're confident
this will work?

00:57.158 --> 00:58.559
Yes. You don't
have to stay.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.761
I can't leave,
but if I stay,

01:00.794 --> 01:02.196
no more secrets.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.464
There was a burn test today.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.199
And how'd it go?
Perfect.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.634
CARNAHAN: Not sure what they
were testing, but they failed.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.869
What the... ?
(system beeping)

01:08.902 --> 01:10.738
You're right, Darius. The
government's plan won't work.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.773
You said the technology
doesn't exist yet.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.508
If you're so damn smart,
invent it.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.210
Come work with us.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.345
Hi. Where can I put my stuff?

01:24.852 --> 01:26.820
(Grace chuckles)

01:26.854 --> 01:29.190
Okay. Uh, passport,

01:29.223 --> 01:30.891
antibiotics, cell
phone charger-- ooh,

01:30.924 --> 01:33.161
and the ambassador's
cell number.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.828
If you have any problems,
he's a personal friend.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.497
Mom, it's Africa,
not Jupiter.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.232
But I'm just a Skype away.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.467
(laughing): Okay.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.135
(rumbling)

01:41.169 --> 01:42.670
(Zoe gasps)

01:42.703 --> 01:45.539
ZOE:
What's happening?

01:45.573 --> 01:46.874
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.108
Told me what?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.279
(gasps)

01:51.312 --> 01:53.547
Happy birthday.
(gasps)

01:53.581 --> 01:54.715
Okay. Whoa, hey,
there's fire here.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.884
Oh. Sorry.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.720
Sorry.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.422
Bad dream.
(laughs)
Yeah.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.590
Bad night, apparently.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.824
You all right?

02:03.857 --> 02:05.293
Yeah, yeah.

02:06.827 --> 02:10.364
Yeah, I must have just
conked out on the couch.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.466
I'm still working
on your birthday gift.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.801
Oh.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.803
But in the meantime,

02:15.836 --> 02:18.706
gluten and dairy-free
for the woman

02:18.739 --> 02:20.308
that likes to
live on the edge.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.176
Thank you, baby.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.877
Make a wish.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.547
(sighs)

02:32.420 --> 02:33.821
ED:
So Darius Tanz

02:33.854 --> 02:35.956
left the embassy ball
with a Pentagon flack

02:35.989 --> 02:38.859
and a kid from MIT,
and you think that's a story?

02:38.892 --> 02:41.362
They had a secret meeting
in his compound

02:41.395 --> 02:42.930
in the middle
of the night.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.698
Amanda, this is
CapitolEyesNews.com,

02:44.732 --> 02:46.367
not The Washington Post.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.702
We do not have the money
to fund goose chases.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.672
A Pentagon employee
was murdered the next day.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.774
My guy at Metro Police
slipped me the file.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.843
His name's Walter Carnahan;
he was in satellite operations

02:55.876 --> 02:57.578
with top security clearance.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.914
So what's the autopsy say?
There was none.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.383
Someone's trying
to keep this quiet.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.718
The question is why?

03:11.959 --> 03:12.726
(elevator bell dings)

03:15.829 --> 03:17.431
Happy birthday, boss.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.766
(chuckles)
Thanks.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.934
Older but not wiser.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.271
Delivery just came for you,
but there was no card.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.472
Secret admirer?

03:24.505 --> 03:26.574
Oh, yeah.
You know me,

03:26.607 --> 03:28.909
got them lining
up out the door.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.026
Thank you for the flowers.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.461
What flowers?

03:50.531 --> 03:53.501
Hey, I, uh, I also got you
a little something.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.802
You didn't need to...

03:54.835 --> 03:55.903
No.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.871
I did.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.710
A4 security badge.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.945
Oh, the way to a woman's heart.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.580
If you're gonna be
on the task force,

04:06.614 --> 04:08.549
you need the
highest level clearance.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.017
So I can tell you everything.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.423
The rocket test failed, Grace.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.427
Oh.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.762
I couldn't tell you before,

04:21.795 --> 04:24.332
but now...

04:24.365 --> 04:26.600
(sighs)

04:26.634 --> 04:29.403
No more secrets.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.772
No more secrets?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.607
So...
(sighs)

04:33.641 --> 04:36.377
Your birthday dinner.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.579
You know, once upon a time,
we had plans.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.749
Mmm. Well, you just gave me
the highest level clearance.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.718
What would it look like if
anyone thought we were...?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.454
Yeah, I know, I know.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.456
We need to keep this
professional, but...
Mm-hmm.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.424
...we could have
a professional dinner.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.059
Could we? Really?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.728
(laughing): Yeah.
(chuckling)

04:54.762 --> 04:57.097
Come on, I don't want you
to be alone on your birthday.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.766
(inhales)
Me, neither.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.733
(knock at door)

05:02.069 --> 05:04.004
Yeah?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.739
They're ready for you.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.344
(sighs)

05:10.378 --> 05:13.747
As we're all aware,
the rocket test failed.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.816
We can't launch
a gravity tractor

05:15.849 --> 05:18.486
up to the asteroid in time
to divert it off its path.

05:18.519 --> 05:22.356
But our planetary defense
team has a viable

05:22.390 --> 05:23.391
alternative plan.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.592
Dr. Strauss.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.360
Thank you,
Deputy Secretary.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.396
After reviewing
the alternatives,

05:28.429 --> 05:30.698
we believe that this is
the next best option.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.533
The IO Probe.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.368
A NASA spacecraft

05:34.402 --> 05:35.469
currently orbiting Jupiter.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.937
The plan would be

05:36.970 --> 05:38.839
to redirect it from
Jupiter's orbit,

05:38.872 --> 05:40.441
and propel it into the asteroid.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.642
The impact

05:41.675 --> 05:44.111
could alter its
trajectory just enough

05:44.144 --> 05:46.647
for it to miss Earth.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.649
(Tanz chuckles)

05:48.682 --> 05:49.850
Throwing rocks

05:49.883 --> 05:51.585
at an oncoming train,
a bold strategy.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.820
I'll be right
behind you.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.422
You have an issue
with this plan?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.390
Yes. In a word,

05:56.424 --> 05:58.158
it stinks--
that's two words, actually.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.760
What Captain Planet here

05:59.793 --> 06:01.862
fails to mention is
that a high-velocity

06:01.895 --> 06:03.831
kinetic impact
could just as easily

06:03.864 --> 06:06.133
smash our asteroid friend
into several pieces--

06:06.166 --> 06:09.036
now you've turned one
problem into ten.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.572
It's raining asteroids,
each of which

06:11.605 --> 06:13.106
may cause cataclysmic damage.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.842
I take it that you have
a better idea?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.076
You had it right
the first time:

06:16.109 --> 06:17.578
the gravity tractor.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.012
Send it up, do a fly-by,

06:19.046 --> 06:21.649
the mass of the GT pulls the
asteroid off its trajectory.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.117
No muss, no fuss,

06:24.151 --> 06:25.653
no loss of life.
HARRIS:
Darius,

06:25.686 --> 06:27.521
I just said, we don't have

06:27.555 --> 06:28.822
the technology...
TANZ:
Not yet.

06:28.856 --> 06:32.092
All we need is
a working EM drive,

06:32.125 --> 06:33.794
and I can build it.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.663
An electromagnetic drive?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.197
You're insane.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.199
You're not the first
to say so.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.100
What exactly is
an EM drive?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.835
Liam?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.037
A rocket can only carry

06:44.071 --> 06:45.673
so much fuel.

06:45.706 --> 06:46.907
Right? So you get
one big initial

06:46.940 --> 06:48.208
push from the thrust,
and that's as fast

06:48.241 --> 06:49.977
as it's ever gonna go.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.211
But with an EM drive,

06:51.244 --> 06:52.946
the force is small
but it's constant,

06:52.980 --> 06:54.515
so it keeps accelerating,

06:54.548 --> 06:56.083
getting faster and faster
as it goes.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.585
With an EM drive,
we can get to the moon

06:57.618 --> 06:58.519
in hours instead of days,

06:58.552 --> 07:00.187
to Mars in a few weeks
instead of months,

07:00.220 --> 07:01.989
and to our asteroid friend here,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.824
with just enough time
for a gravity tractor--

07:03.857 --> 07:04.958
you had it right
the first time--

07:04.992 --> 07:07.695
to save us all
from extinction.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.864
No one has ever built
a working EM drive.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.501
It violates the laws
of Newtonian physics.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.936
And-and Newtonian physics
violated Aristotelian physics

07:15.969 --> 07:18.238
back in the day; you know,
laws were made to be broken.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.608
I-I could
drone on about

07:20.641 --> 07:22.776
pilot wave theory and
quantum vacuum fluctuations,

07:22.810 --> 07:25.479
but seeing as we have
approximately 181 days

07:25.513 --> 07:27.681
left to live, I'd rather just
go off and build the damn thing,

07:27.715 --> 07:29.149
if you don't mind.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.884
And what would it take
to "build the damn thing"?

07:32.720 --> 07:33.787
$2 billion.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.026
To start.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.594
Okay, a request that large
would have to go through

07:40.628 --> 07:42.129
congressional oversight.

07:42.162 --> 07:42.963
The White House
doesn't want us

07:42.996 --> 07:44.998
raising any red
flags in Congress.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.735
Any leak, at all,

07:47.768 --> 07:49.036
could cause widespread
panic, anarchy.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.940
Especially when there's no proof
that this thing actually works.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.842
They said the Manhattan Project
would take ten years.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.110
They did it in two.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.713
They got together
the greatest minds on Earth,

07:59.747 --> 08:01.949
and they did it
because they had to.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.785
I'm sorry, but this is
no time for bureaucracy.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.754
Darius is saying he has
a plan to save us all,

08:06.787 --> 08:08.255
so let him do it.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.123
Or at least try.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.027
(sighs)

08:17.064 --> 08:17.965
All right.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.167
Half.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.670
I'll get you half.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.672
(sighs)

08:26.306 --> 08:28.742
The world's going to be
reduced to a ball of ash

08:28.776 --> 08:30.110
in six months, but no,
let's all play but the rules.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.179
Darius, stop.
Yeah, well, I agreed to
work with the Pentagon.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.113
I thought it'd be
a two-way street.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.381
He just got you
a billion dollars in there.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.849
That's something.
You told me you'd do
whatever it takes.

08:35.883 --> 08:36.884
Get me what I need.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.019
Fine, what else
do you need?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.223
100 kilos of
enriched uranium.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.026
Oh! Let's make it
1,000 while we're asking.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.229
You're insane.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.197
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.331
It's kinda true.
No one is going to approve

08:51.364 --> 08:54.267
the transfer of radioactive
bomb-making materials to you

08:54.301 --> 08:56.136
without asking questions
that we can't answer.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.105
Exactly. Grace,
bureaucratic red tape

08:58.138 --> 08:59.907
will kill us before the
asteroid ever gets here.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.675
We need to think bigger
than the government does

09:01.709 --> 09:03.877
and move a hell
of a lot faster.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.178
So what are you suggesting?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.681
We both know Harris is one
of a handful of people

09:07.715 --> 09:09.082
with access codes
that would allow

09:09.116 --> 09:10.183
for the transfer
of nuclear material.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.585
No, he'll never
agree to this.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.085
I know.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.822
So you want me to go
behind his back.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.923
Betray my boss.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.591
Your "boss"?

09:19.359 --> 09:20.761
It's treason.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.196
This is where rubber
meets road, Grace.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.999
You want to help me save
the human race or don't you?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.209
*

09:44.752 --> 09:47.187
LIAM:
So, in order to save the world

09:47.220 --> 09:48.722
we need a billion dollars
we don't have,

09:48.756 --> 09:50.090
uranium we can't get,

09:50.123 --> 09:51.725
and technology
that doesn't even exist?

09:51.759 --> 09:53.393
So far, so good.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.763
If Superman caught
the villain on page two,

09:55.796 --> 09:57.064
what fun would that be?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.398
Fun? That's what this is?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.100
Darius, the satellite
team needs five minutes

10:00.133 --> 10:01.869
and the telecom group
sent design specs.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.370
Push everything.
You have the TID?

10:03.403 --> 10:05.272
This opens up
any door at Tanz.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.107
Almost any door.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.276
Hey, so about

10:09.309 --> 10:10.744
those three impossible tasks...

10:10.778 --> 10:11.812
You see roadblocks,
I see challenges.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.046
Well, no,
Newton's third law

10:13.080 --> 10:14.147
isn't a roadblock,
it's a brick wall.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.717
I've had a team working on
EM drive for three years.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.251
We've made progress,
I just need help

10:18.285 --> 10:19.820
to expedite it
over the finish line.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.689
What kind of help?
Malcolm Croft.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.056
My professor?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.058
He's been experimenting
with EM drive theory.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.894
Yeah, I know, but he's gone,
he's gone AWOL.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.662
It's not so much him we need
as his research.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.798
It may be the missing piece.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.199
Well, my buddy Diego
was Croft's T.A.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.934
I can call him and
see what he knows.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.135
Oh, you'll do better than that.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.837
You're going to Boston.
I am?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.305
Helicopter's waiting out back.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.841
Helicopter? But I...
Hate airplanes. Yeah.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.010
Helicopter.
No, I hate sky.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.012
You know, and the potential to
fall out of it. I like trains.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.047
Yeah, why don't you just
saddle up a snail?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.683
It's not like the fate of the
world's hanging in the balance.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.685
This is...
Some walking-around money.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.854
You never know when it's
gonna come in handy.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.757
Where are you going?
To find a billion dollars.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.044
Why bring Darius in if
you're not gonna give him

11:17.077 --> 11:18.779
everything he needs
to get the job done?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.447
Two billion dollars?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.482
What else has he got on his
shopping list-- nuclear weapons?

11:22.515 --> 11:25.418
And if he did?
I'd say no.

11:25.452 --> 11:29.222
Grace, I want Darius
to succeed. We all do.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.758
But this is
a government-run operation

11:30.791 --> 11:32.259
under the tightest veil
of secrecy.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.061
There's protocol here.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.964
What good is protocol if
we're all dead in six months?

11:36.997 --> 11:39.166
(phone ringing)

11:41.468 --> 11:43.103
Harris.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.105
Okay, send it in.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.174
I got to take this.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.079
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.214
(piano playing
classical music)

12:06.994 --> 12:09.029
Catherine.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.032
Darius.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.334
What's so pressing
it couldn't wait?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.036
Let me guess.
You're busy saving

12:16.069 --> 12:17.470
the world again.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.339
Someone has to.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.841
Yeah, still amazes me.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.042
All you've built.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.510
We built.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.379
To think it all started
with a deal

12:26.413 --> 12:28.048
signed on a cocktail napkin.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.449
And a weekend in Fiji.

12:31.384 --> 12:35.088
But you didn't ask me here
to walk down memory lane.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.226
What if I told you I'm embarking

12:39.259 --> 12:41.995
on the biggest project
I've ever undertaken?

12:42.029 --> 12:44.497
One that could pay
financial dividends

12:44.531 --> 12:46.233
for centuries?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.868
How much do you need?

12:47.901 --> 12:50.270
A billion, to start.
You'd get

12:50.303 --> 12:52.272
one of the first seats to Mars.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.075
Why don't you just come up
with the money yourself?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.177
I've already emptied
my own pockets for this one.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.379
Your passion gets in the way
of your business sense.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.081
Nothing's worth doing

13:01.114 --> 13:03.316
unless you're willing
to lose everything.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.186
And you have. Twice.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.057
But I'm not willing
to lose everything,

13:10.090 --> 13:13.293
so perhaps you should show me
what you got.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.795
That can be arranged.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.841
Diego?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.609
Dude, I thought you went
to work for Darius Tanz.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.145
I-I did. I am.
You lucky sack.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.214
You know you're the envy
of every student on campus.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.016
Is it epic?
Epic does not capture.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.885
Look, I can't
explain, but have

13:37.918 --> 13:39.419
you heard from Croft?
No, man. I guess

13:39.452 --> 13:41.188
that, uh, sabbatical
thing was real.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.090
He bounced. Don't think
he's coming back.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.058
Did he leave behind
any of his research?
Cleaned out his office.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.359
You know how paranoid he was.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.928
He'd never leave
anything behind.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.197
The EM drive-- did you work
with him on that?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.933
Yeah, for, like, ten
minutes. It was a dead end.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.501
Croft said it was kind
of like trying to fly

13:54.534 --> 13:56.203
by pulling yourself
up by your hair.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.971
Only works in cartoons.
Crap.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.907
Although, there
was this one time

13:59.940 --> 14:01.909
he took all his
T.A.s out for dinner,

14:01.942 --> 14:04.077
and had a little too much to
drink, and started rambling

14:04.111 --> 14:07.114
about having a super secret
backup hidden at his place.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.415
Backup drive?

14:08.448 --> 14:11.584
Like I said, paranoid.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.420
Dude, you rock. Thank you.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.655
Hey, uh,

14:15.688 --> 14:17.124
whatever happened to that
girl with the notebook?

14:17.157 --> 14:18.992
What's her name?
Jillian.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.128
JILLIAN:
What if no one

14:21.161 --> 14:22.362
comes?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.431
You finished a novel.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.034
That's an accomplishment.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.936
You got to get used
to sharing your work.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.604
Yeah, my self-published work,
'cause no one wanted it.

14:31.638 --> 14:36.176
And I'm reading it in
my parents' bookstore.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.545
Hey, what about that boy
from, uh... from MIT you met?

14:38.578 --> 14:40.147
You could invite him.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.581
He moved to D.C.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.952
Ah. That's too bad.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.120
Yeah.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.226
(keyboard keys clacking)

15:27.160 --> 15:28.928
(chimes)

15:30.163 --> 15:31.598
(intercom buzzes)

15:31.631 --> 15:33.733
WOMAN:
Grace, press briefing in ten.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.036
Thank you.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.074
...setting the table for renewed
military cooperation

15:41.108 --> 15:42.509
between the United States
and India.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.511
Any other questions?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.446
Hey, Frank. New tie?

15:46.479 --> 15:50.317
Your wife has good taste.
Thank you, everyone.
(laughter)

15:50.350 --> 15:53.386
Ms. Barrows, can you comment
on the recent murder of DOD

15:53.420 --> 15:55.488
employee Walter
Carnahan at his home?

16:01.061 --> 16:03.763
For reasons of privacy,
we cannot comment

16:03.796 --> 16:06.033
on personal employee matters.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.000
Thank you.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.150
(door handle clicking,
rattling)

16:23.183 --> 16:25.752
(knocking)
Professor Croft?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.130
(grunts)

16:38.431 --> 16:40.100
(groans)

16:40.133 --> 16:42.535
Oh, I can't believe...
this is my life.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.204
(sighs)

16:44.237 --> 16:46.373
(clock ticking)

16:50.743 --> 16:52.712
(clock ticking)

16:54.447 --> 16:57.250
911? My professor--
his place is trashed,

16:57.284 --> 16:59.186
and he didn't show up
for class.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.388
Damn.
(floorboards creaking)

17:37.190 --> 17:39.692
(clock ticking)

17:39.726 --> 17:40.693
Hello?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.495
(soft thud)

17:47.834 --> 17:49.769
(phone buzzing)

18:10.823 --> 18:12.392
GRACE:
What are we looking at?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.161
The Tanz Goliath 2 rocket.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.562
They failed.
Shut it down, Carn.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.363
Shut it down!

18:18.598 --> 18:20.500
Excuse me. I'm
looking for Carnahan?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.769
Who?
Walter Carnahan.
This is his station.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.171
D-Do you know what
happened to him?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.905
Beats me, I'm the new guy.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.607
Pete.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.911
(knocks quickly)

18:31.944 --> 18:33.246
HARRIS:
Grace?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.248
Did we kill Walter Carnahan?

18:35.282 --> 18:36.816
Harris.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.261
Grace, listen to yourself.
You really believe

18:48.295 --> 18:49.829
the U.S. government carries out
hits on its own people?

18:49.862 --> 18:51.298
I don't know what I believe.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.400
I just know my friend is dead.

18:53.433 --> 18:57.337
Why would the government want
to kill a low-level sat tech?

18:57.370 --> 18:59.472
Maybe he accessed files

18:59.506 --> 19:00.773
he wasn't supposed to.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.342
What files?

19:03.743 --> 19:05.812
I don't...

19:05.845 --> 19:08.648
(whispering):
Hey, hey, Grace.

19:08.681 --> 19:12.619
Look, with everything we know,
it's easy to get paranoid.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.822
But there's nothing here.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.493
Maybe you're right.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.338
(panting)

19:38.478 --> 19:40.447
(sniffles)

19:40.480 --> 19:41.714
(phone chimes)

19:44.817 --> 19:46.753
(metal clatters)

20:05.305 --> 20:06.205
Grace.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.842
Oh. I, uh... I'm so sorry,

20:09.876 --> 20:12.279
your assistant
sent me up.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.946
She said you were finishing up
a meeting.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.616
And we are. Grace Barrows,
Catherine Adams.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.386
Grace is my government
liaison for the Mars project

20:19.419 --> 20:21.454
I was telling you about.
Yes.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.956
Nice to meet you.
Catherine and I

20:23.990 --> 20:25.858
have been intertwined
for many years.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.660
She funded
my very first creation

20:27.694 --> 20:29.662
and possibly my next.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.731
Good to see you again, Darius.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.434
I'll be in touch.
Soon, I hope. Um...

20:34.467 --> 20:35.668
I'm meeting Mark Cuban tomorrow
and you know he doesn't like

20:35.702 --> 20:37.904
to share the wealth.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.872
You didn't tell me there
was any competition.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.474
There's always competition.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.879
Lucky for me, I always win.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.517
(elevator beeps)

20:50.550 --> 20:51.984
I'm not even gonna ask.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.520
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna tell.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.855
Now, I assume you're here
for a reason.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.990
You were right.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.026
We can't trust the government.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.695
We have to do
this ourselves.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.297
Uranium.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.933
I know where to get it.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.468
She tried to cover,
but I could tell

21:08.501 --> 21:10.703
she was rattled
by the Carnahan thing.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.506
If I could just talk to her
in person, just the two of us...

21:13.540 --> 21:15.808
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
she'll go for that.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.478
Maybe Ms. Barrows needs
a little motivation.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.912
Okay, we both just got promoted.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.648
Please do not
do anything stupid.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.949
Are you kidding me?

21:22.982 --> 21:24.584
I'm gonna put us on the map.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.353
Don't screw this up.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.791
(horn honks)

21:39.632 --> 21:41.634
(sniffles)

21:49.642 --> 21:51.611
JILLIAN:
This is grim.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.113
Well.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.515
It's all right.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.949
Today, there's four people.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.085
Next time, there will be eight.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.955
Get 'em.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.024
(whispers):
Okay...

22:10.730 --> 22:12.632
(cell phone chimes)

22:22.809 --> 22:24.744
(sighs)

22:25.978 --> 22:27.914
Hi there.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.649
Thank you all for coming.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.950
I'm Jillian Hayes

22:30.983 --> 22:33.853
and this is Shadow Side.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.356
(chuckles) Thanks, Dad.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.395
Hey, guys.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.563
Do you want to make
some quick cash?

22:43.596 --> 22:44.697
What you talking about, man?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.799
JILLIAN: "Vel Durok had
been stranded before.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.469
"Once in Yosemite,
when a freak snowstorm hit.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.571
"Another time when she was

22:51.604 --> 22:53.640
in the Gobi Desert
when her camel died."

22:53.673 --> 22:54.607
(door opens, bell tinkles)

22:57.944 --> 23:02.014
"She always managed
to outrun fate, to cheat death.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.552
"But now she was over
two light-years from home,

23:05.585 --> 23:07.854
"trapped alone
on the shadow side of a planet

23:07.887 --> 23:09.989
that as yet had no name."

23:19.732 --> 23:21.067
(phone chimes)

23:30.877 --> 23:33.680
I wasn't sure you were game
after our last conversation.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.014
Neither was I.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.685
What changed your mind?

23:38.718 --> 23:40.520
Things.

23:42.121 --> 23:42.689
You sure the
government can't track

23:42.722 --> 23:44.190
what we're doing here?

23:44.223 --> 23:46.626
This computer, this room,
is surveillance proof.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.595
I should know;
I built it myself.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.764
Okay.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.633
There are a handful of
uranium storage facilities

23:53.666 --> 23:54.867
around the country.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.102
This one's our best bet.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.571
The WIPP.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.573
DARIUS:
A Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.741
GRACE:
Out near Wallops.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.643
20 miles from here.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.678
They store radioactive waste
from nuclear weapons processing.

24:05.712 --> 24:08.114
So, you've enlisted
Harris to help?

24:08.147 --> 24:10.517
No, his hands are tied.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.951
But mine aren't.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.220
You're stealing the code.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.690
Every day Harris is issued
a new authorization code,

24:17.724 --> 24:20.693
allowing him to approve the
transfer of nuclear material.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.662
Now, I can get into
the WIPP facility,

24:22.695 --> 24:24.797
but I can't get the uranium
without that code

24:24.831 --> 24:26.699
and it expires at midnight.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.268
And he keeps it in his briefcase
secured with a biometric lock.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.202
Yes.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.604
How are you
gonna access it?

24:33.906 --> 24:35.207
We're having dinner tonight.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.677
Look, this is
a complex plan.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.178
There's no guarantees.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.212
But you wouldn't be here
if you didn't think

24:40.246 --> 24:41.180
you could pull it off,
would you?

24:41.213 --> 24:45.051
Darius, I don't want
Harris implicated. Okay?

24:45.084 --> 24:47.053
If anything goes wrong,
I take the fall.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.121
You sure about this?

24:49.155 --> 24:51.591
Am I sure?

24:51.624 --> 24:54.594
I've been a rule-follower
my whole life.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.228
I never drive alone
in the carpool lane.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.598
If it says ten items
or less, I have less.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.567
And now I'm considering
stealing uranium

25:00.600 --> 25:01.901
from the United
States government.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.102
And betraying a man you love.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.877
Am I sure?

25:10.910 --> 25:13.546
Absolutely not.

25:13.580 --> 25:16.215
But like you said, we're talking
about the fate of the world.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.853
The rule book just
went out the window.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.327
This just came for you,
hand-delivered.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.229
Thanks.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.119
*

26:02.061 --> 26:03.663
So glad you could join me.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.999
You have the subtlety
of a hand grenade.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.268
You know there's nothing going
on between me and Darius Tanz.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.703
What do you want?

26:10.737 --> 26:12.905
The real story.
Okay.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.174
(laughs) Amanda, you've been
a journalist for, what...

26:15.207 --> 26:16.943
five minutes?

26:16.976 --> 26:18.911
And I hesitate to use
the word "journalist."

26:18.945 --> 26:20.880
I have a master's in Journalism
from Columbia.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.282
I interned at the Post.
Well, then

26:23.315 --> 26:26.085
you should know real reporters
don't publish fake news.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.055
A DOD employee with high
security clearance was murdered.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.189
That's not fake.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.859
Yes. A robbery gone wrong.

26:32.892 --> 26:36.062
Yeah, so wrong that his body
was released to his family

26:36.095 --> 26:37.897
without a formal autopsy?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.298
That's at the M.E.'s discretion.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.634
Happens under the rarest
of circumstances.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.636
This falls way outside
normal protocol.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.371
I bet you could find
a conspiracy

26:45.404 --> 26:46.973
in a game of solitaire.

26:47.006 --> 26:50.242
Hmm. I spoke with
Walt Carnahan's sister.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.244
She said he was troubled

26:52.278 --> 26:54.981
about something
that happened at work.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.415
Troubled how?

26:56.448 --> 26:58.951
He saw a file he wasn't
supposed to see, apparently.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.252
Project Atlas.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.154
Atlas? I've never heard of it.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.924
She said if anything
happened to him,

27:04.957 --> 27:06.125
that it wasn't an accident.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.731
Look, Amanda, I've
never heard of Atlas.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.200
And what happened to
Walt Carnahan is tragic,

27:14.233 --> 27:15.167
but it's not a conspiracy.

27:16.903 --> 27:20.272
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to be somewhere.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.074
Oh, and feel free
to publish those photos.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.209
Red's my color.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.360
LIAM:
Yeah, right here is fine.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.830
Thanks. Keep the change.
Hey, thanks.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.739
(dog barking)

27:55.975 --> 27:58.144
(glass tinkles)

27:59.278 --> 28:01.380
Professor Croft.
Shh, shh, shh.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.149
It's not safe.
Come on.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.924
(whispering):
So that night when you left,

28:11.958 --> 28:13.359
I called my friend at NASA

28:13.392 --> 28:16.062
just to check your math
and about two hours later,

28:16.095 --> 28:19.198
these spooks show up,
no warrant, no nothing.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.234
Tossed everything and
I escaped out the back door.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.270
Your discovery has
rattled someone, Liam.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.371
How did you know I
was in your house?

28:25.404 --> 28:28.074
A remote security camera.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.076
Jesus, you really are paranoid.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.811
Well, it turns out
I have reason to be.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.914
I have a way to
protect us both,

28:34.947 --> 28:36.348
but I need to know
where your research is

28:36.382 --> 28:38.517
on the EM drive.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.220
The EM drive?
Please, tell me you have

28:41.253 --> 28:44.056
that research saved
to a cloud somewhere.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.057
No, the cloud's not safe.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.860
But this is.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.228
What's on this?

28:49.261 --> 28:50.863
Everything.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.238
(whispering):
Professor.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.773
We need to go.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.041
Right now. Back door.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.912
HARRIS:
Here's to you...

29:05.945 --> 29:08.514
and another trip
around the sun.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.918
Hopefully not our last.

29:11.951 --> 29:15.387
* The rules of unengaging

29:15.421 --> 29:20.793
* And the signs
of unreceptive pores... *

29:24.496 --> 29:27.399
Harris.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.901
What's Atlas?

29:28.935 --> 29:30.336
* Bedside horrors

29:30.369 --> 29:32.939
* Tepid dreams.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.107
Where did you hear that name?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.844
A reporter from Capitol Eyes.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.478
Carnahan told his sister

29:39.511 --> 29:43.282
if anything happened to him,
it was because of Atlas.

29:43.315 --> 29:47.386
Grace, don't say that word
to anybody...

29:47.419 --> 29:49.421
ever.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.226
Okay, I... I'm sorry.
It-it's...

29:54.260 --> 29:57.163
(sighs) There
are still things

29:57.196 --> 29:59.231
above your clearance level.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.499
You understand?

30:00.532 --> 30:03.335
Yeah, yeah, of course.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.276
Oh, my God.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.978
I'm so sorry.
(laughing): No.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.446
It's okay. Uh...

30:14.480 --> 30:16.115
uh, you know what,
let me, let me go change.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.950
Okay. (chuckles)

30:17.984 --> 30:19.218
Just give me a minute.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.053
Sorry.
It's all right.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.135
(cell phone beeping)

30:41.273 --> 30:42.308
(phone trills quietly)

30:50.282 --> 30:51.918
HARRIS:
What gets red wine out?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.585
Was it salt or peroxide?

30:53.619 --> 30:55.654
Uh...

30:55.687 --> 30:58.590
Hydrogen peroxide mixed
with dishwashing soap.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.470
(briefcase lock beeps)

31:15.241 --> 31:17.176
(exhales)

31:20.712 --> 31:22.949
(whispering):
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.398
You know, if you
wanted my pants off,

31:39.431 --> 31:40.599
you could've just asked.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.001
(laughs)

31:43.602 --> 31:46.105
Hey.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.439
Grace, you're shaking.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.608
Look, I'm sorry.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.243
I didn't mean to scare you.

31:51.277 --> 31:55.381
Oh.
You know, it's just
this-this job, you know...

31:55.414 --> 31:57.083
the things we know.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.284
(cell phone ringing)

32:04.723 --> 32:07.259
Darius?

32:07.293 --> 32:08.594
Right now?

32:08.627 --> 32:10.296
It's almost 10:00.

32:12.564 --> 32:13.665
(sighs)

32:13.699 --> 32:15.201
Yeah.

32:15.234 --> 32:18.504
Okay. Okay.
I'll be there.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.973
Darius has the money
on the hook.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.075
He needs me to sell our
collaboration to an investor.

32:23.109 --> 32:26.012
Go, go. That's what's
most important.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.217
I wish I didn't have
to leave you on your birthday.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.220
There's a lot of things we
wish we didn't have to do.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.322
You go. I'll lock up.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.290
(sighs)

32:46.232 --> 32:47.599
(door opens, closes)

32:52.071 --> 32:53.605
(phone speed-dials)

32:56.208 --> 32:59.578
Code 9-5-7-2-3. Charlie, Victor.

32:59.611 --> 33:03.282
Authorizing transfer of
four P-9 barrels of Uranium-235

33:03.315 --> 33:05.551
from the WIPP facility
in Maryland.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.653
This had to be tonight?

33:07.686 --> 33:10.656
I'm just doing my share,
Deputy Secretary,

33:10.689 --> 33:13.592
by selling my investor
on the Mars project.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.294
And you don't mind
lying to her

33:15.327 --> 33:17.363
about where her money
is really going?

33:17.396 --> 33:20.132
If we beat this thing,
then Mars is a go.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.468
If we don't, then...

33:22.501 --> 33:24.403
a lie's a bit inconsequential,
don't you think?

33:24.436 --> 33:26.105
(elevator bell dings)

33:27.373 --> 33:29.175
Good evening, gentlemen.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.510
I understand you have
a proposal for me.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.196
A4 clearance.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.730
Yes, ma'am, what can I
do for you, Ms. Barrows?

33:54.466 --> 33:56.835
95723 Charlie, Victor.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.138
Your authorization code is
verified, looks in order.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.572
Hope so.

34:00.606 --> 34:03.442
Dragged my ass
out of bed for this.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.776
You just need to wait
20 minutes

34:04.810 --> 34:06.545
until my supervisor
can sign off.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.847
I don't have 20 minutes.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.149
Sorry, ma'am, but that's not...

34:10.182 --> 34:12.118
Corporal Nevins,

34:12.151 --> 34:14.220
I know you've got your
orders-- I appreciate that.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.554
But I've got my orders as well.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.689
It's now ten minutes
to midnight,

34:17.723 --> 34:19.691
and my authorization code's
about to expire.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.593
You saw my clearance
level, correct?

34:21.627 --> 34:23.295
Yes, ma'am.
Then you know
my supervisor

34:23.329 --> 34:24.863
is Deputy Secretary
of Defense.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.566
Not the world's
most patient man.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.268
If I go back to the Pentagon
empty-handed,

34:29.301 --> 34:30.769
you know the first thing
he'll ask?

34:30.802 --> 34:32.771
"What was the stumbling block,
Ms. Barrows?"

34:32.804 --> 34:34.740
I'm gonna have to tell him
the stumbling block was you.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.545
Now, can we get on with this?

34:53.325 --> 34:55.827
The United States wants
to see an American flag

34:55.861 --> 34:58.797
on the surface of Mars
just as much as Mr. Tanz.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.767
Tanz Industries will
have full access

35:01.800 --> 35:03.335
to previously classified
defense technologies

35:03.369 --> 35:04.603
that could save tens
if not hundreds

35:04.636 --> 35:06.905
of millions of dollars in R&D.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.840
DARIUS: We're talking
advanced radar,

35:08.874 --> 35:10.409
hyperlight composites,

35:10.442 --> 35:12.811
and next-gen
manufacturing techniques.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.214
Imagine what we could do
with DARPA's toy box

35:15.247 --> 35:18.184
at our disposal-- you'd get
a piece of everything.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.719
Ticket sales, patents
on the scientific research.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.689
Evolving fields of medicine,
energy, physics.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.324
Small contribution to change
the course of history,

35:25.357 --> 35:26.858
don't you think?

35:26.892 --> 35:28.460
CATHERINE: Why the sudden
spirit of collaboration

35:28.494 --> 35:30.396
between Darius
and the government?

35:30.429 --> 35:31.797
Not to be cynical, but...

35:31.830 --> 35:34.733
your relationship hasn't
always been so amicable.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.803
Politics makes
strange bedfellows.

35:37.836 --> 35:42.308
We don't want anyone else
getting there first, do we?

35:42.341 --> 35:45.511
And all you need from me
is a billion dollars.

35:52.818 --> 35:53.952
Load it up, guys.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.255
Yes, ma'am.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.257
(gate squeaking)

36:08.634 --> 36:10.469
(cell phone chimes)

36:20.979 --> 36:22.281
Oh...

36:30.522 --> 36:31.690
SOLDIER: That's
the last one, ma'am.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.492
Let's move out.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.294
(siren whooping,
tires screeching)

36:37.463 --> 36:39.665
MAN:
Stop right there!

36:41.667 --> 36:43.969
Ma'am, you're not authorized

36:44.002 --> 36:46.272
to be inside this facility
without my approval.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.407
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
we were on a tight timeline.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.576
This is not proper protocol.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.311
I'm gonna need to call
your supervisor.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.745
Supervisor?

36:53.779 --> 36:56.348
Deputy Secretary
Harris Edwards.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.799
(phone speed-dialing)

37:15.501 --> 37:16.802
(line ringing)

37:17.336 --> 37:19.638
So this is what billionaire
scotch tastes like.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.007
Between us, that's hundred-
millionaire scotch at best.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.542
Come back after
we save the planet,

37:23.575 --> 37:24.976
I'll break out
the really good stuff.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.679
(phone ringing)

37:29.848 --> 37:32.017
Hmm, could have sworn
that was me.
No, that's me.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.386
Sorry, I should
actually take this.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.390
Thanks for the drink.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.395
(line ringing)

37:45.397 --> 37:46.732
DARIUS (without his accent):
Yes...

37:48.867 --> 37:50.035
...this is Harris Edwards.

37:57.543 --> 37:58.477
Yes, sir.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.550
Sorry for the delay.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.352
You're all clear.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.938
Just tell me we're
one step closer

38:26.972 --> 38:28.540
to saving the world.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.409
The entire human race.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.045
You were able to
clone Harris' phone?

38:34.079 --> 38:36.982
It's a Tanz phone, like all
government-issued phones.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.651
One of my first big contracts
with the U.S. of A.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.788
And you're sure there'll be
no blowback on him?

38:42.821 --> 38:45.391
All communications related
to this endeavor have been

38:45.424 --> 38:47.058
erased from existence.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.361
Just one of the perks from
owning your own satellite fleet.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.065
You really care
for him, don't you?

38:56.535 --> 38:58.437
Good night, Darius.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.973
Oh, and Grace...

39:02.007 --> 39:04.109
happy birthday.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.883
And many more.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.552
(door opens, shuts)

39:13.585 --> 39:15.120
(sighs)

39:33.805 --> 39:36.174
* Sunshine, wake up

39:36.207 --> 39:39.445
* Shower, makeup

39:39.478 --> 39:41.046
* Have some coffee

39:41.079 --> 39:42.914
* Oh, you

39:42.948 --> 39:46.418
* Oh, I don't know *

39:46.452 --> 39:49.387
* What I'd do without you *

39:50.956 --> 39:52.458
(laughs)

39:52.491 --> 39:56.928
* No, I don't know *

39:56.962 --> 39:59.665
* What I'd do without you. *

40:08.840 --> 40:10.609
(elevator bell dings)

40:10.642 --> 40:12.811
You got it?
Croft's research?

40:12.844 --> 40:13.712
I got you more than that.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.217
Malcolm Croft.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.052
Darius Tanz.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.988
(chuckles) For a "C" student,

40:23.021 --> 40:25.624
you've certainly done
all right for yourself.
I get by.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.058
CROFT: I've been trying to
crack the EM drive for years.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.994
And I'm not the only one.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.596
Then let's compare
notes, see if together

40:30.629 --> 40:31.863
we can't do the impossible.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.231
(door opens)

40:33.264 --> 40:35.534
Hey, what the hell, Darius?

40:35.567 --> 40:38.470
Oh, this is Lazlo Simms,
my chief of security.

40:38.504 --> 40:39.771
LIAM:
You put a tail on me?

40:39.805 --> 40:41.172
Next time a heads-up
would be nice,

40:41.206 --> 40:43.775
so you don't scare the
living crap out of me.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.544
A good businessman
always protects his assets.

40:45.577 --> 40:47.513
Professor, you'll be
comfortable here, and safe.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.014
Karissa, my assistant,
she's downstairs.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.549
She'll... She'll
show you to your room.
All right.

40:50.582 --> 40:53.619
Liam, what happened
to the money?

40:53.652 --> 40:56.622
You were right,
it came in handy.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.031
The girl?

41:06.064 --> 41:07.966
He went to see her.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.740
She's gonna be more
of a problem than I thought.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.742
(doorbell rings)

41:16.775 --> 41:19.778
* What you got going on?

41:19.811 --> 41:22.648
I don't care
about the rules.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.516
If this is all the
time we have left...

41:29.621 --> 41:32.591
* And I don't want another *

41:34.092 --> 41:36.027
* Day to break

41:36.061 --> 41:37.996
* Mmm

41:43.101 --> 41:45.604
* Warm shadow

41:47.272 --> 41:49.741
* Mmm

41:57.315 --> 42:00.552
* Warm shadow

42:00.586 --> 42:03.521
* Mmm

42:05.624 --> 42:06.992
(beeps)

42:07.025 --> 42:07.759
(lock clicks)

42:11.029 --> 42:13.298
*

42:15.834 --> 42:17.869
Come on, earring,
please be in here.

42:17.903 --> 42:20.972
* Won't you stop
breaking in *

42:23.208 --> 42:26.077
* Red sky, red light

42:26.111 --> 42:28.647
* Awakening.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.854
Looks like I got
a real story now.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.823
*
