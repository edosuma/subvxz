WEBVTT

00:17.952 --> 00:20.386
Ugh!
Can you believe this guy?

00:20.388 --> 00:23.188
Pete is over an hour late
for our brunch date.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.125
Pete? Who's Pete?
Oh, it's this dude
who goes to my gym.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.893
Thought Jess could use a man
with a little muscle

00:27.895 --> 00:29.495
for a change,
so I set 'em up.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.230
Not gonna marry him,
but I'm having fun.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.298
(chuckles) Knock, knock.
Who's there?

00:33.300 --> 00:35.167
Orange.
Hang on a second, Orange.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.703
I'm gonna send a sext to Pete,
which I did.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.505
My first one ever. Want to see?
It's super hot.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.240
I don't want to, uh...

00:41.242 --> 00:42.708
Okay, that's just
a picture of you

00:42.710 --> 00:44.510
in a bra over a T-shirt

00:44.512 --> 00:46.578
Holding a sign that says
"Property of Pete."

00:46.580 --> 00:48.380
Not a sext.
I'm wearing a bra!

00:48.382 --> 00:50.315
No, that's like
a glorified selfie.
You can see the bra.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.017
Nope.
(scoffs)
I bet he saw this,

00:52.019 --> 00:53.185
and he was like,

00:53.187 --> 00:56.188
(in low voice):
"Oh, delicious."

00:56.190 --> 00:57.322
You want him to say that?

00:57.324 --> 00:58.690
I have to agree,

00:58.692 --> 01:00.325
(phone blipping)
because the true nature

01:00.327 --> 01:03.562
of eroticism
is what is not shown.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.065
COACH:
I never get sexts.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.536
What are you taking?

01:10.538 --> 01:11.670
Just some, uh...
motion sickness pill.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.173
It's a mild sedative.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.041
My mom just landed.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.176
That's unrelated.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.510
Oh, my God, your mom's here?!

01:18.512 --> 01:20.079
I'm so excited to meet her.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.947
You probably won't; she's busy.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.183
But maybe, hopefully,
I doubt it.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.384
I can't believe
I've never met her.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.952
You know, we get together
and we laugh and...

01:26.954 --> 01:28.554
(sighs)
she tells me all the ways that

01:28.556 --> 01:30.589
I could be better at things,
and then I do them,

01:30.591 --> 01:31.957
but not right.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.625
Oh, it's fun.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.360
We have, we have fun.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.029
You know, I wish I had fun
with my partner.

01:37.031 --> 01:38.630
Wow, every time I ask Aly
to hang out,

01:38.632 --> 01:40.365
she's always like, "Nah."
NICK: Hey, Schmidty,<i> vamos.</i>

01:40.367 --> 01:43.268
I want to show you a surprise
investment opportunity.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.437
Surprise, Nick?
I'm telling you right now,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.706
if it is a boat,
I'm gonna be so psyched!

01:47.708 --> 01:49.608
I literally just got
new boat shoes.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.610
JESS: (sputters) Standing
here like a damn jabroni.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.379
He hasn't even answered
any of my texts.

01:54.381 --> 01:55.948
He hasn't?
You don't think he's...

01:55.950 --> 01:59.051
(gasping)
He is blowing you off!

01:59.053 --> 02:01.553
He best not be!
Hell no!

02:01.555 --> 02:03.989
You guys are getting
riled up, huh?
We are gonna
march right over there,

02:03.991 --> 02:05.724
and we all right gonna
find out what's happening!

02:05.726 --> 02:06.725
Let's go.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.597
(door closes)
(groans)

02:11.599 --> 02:14.733
Turns out that Pete
had a very good excuse

02:14.735 --> 02:16.802
for not showing up.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.842
He died.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.644
What?
WINSTON:
¶ Just got out of the shower ¶

02:26.680 --> 02:28.914
¶ Guess who
cleaned everything? ¶

02:28.916 --> 02:30.949
¶ Guess who got in deep? ¶

02:30.951 --> 02:33.752
What?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.861
A motorcycle accident? I didn't
even know Pete rode one.

02:42.863 --> 02:46.198
He didn't. Apparently, he was
thinking about getting one,

02:46.200 --> 02:50.002
and he slipped and fell
on the showroom floor.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.638
Buffed floors...

02:52.640 --> 02:54.640
beautiful, but at what cost?

02:54.642 --> 02:57.476
The first guy I sext dies.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.977
I should go
to the memorial, right?

02:58.979 --> 03:00.479
Jess, don't make this
about yourself, all right?

03:00.481 --> 03:01.713
You went on two dates
with the guy.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.982
I was one of the last people
to text him.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.551
On Earth.
CECE: Look, you didn't even

03:05.553 --> 03:07.386
have sex with him, okay?
You're fine.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.288
So if I'd slept with him,
I'd go.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.956
Or if you'd gone
skiing together.
Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.791
What are these rules?
COACH: Just don't go.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.159
'Cause if you go, then
I'm gonna feel weird

03:14.161 --> 03:15.394
about not going,
and I ain't going.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.029
Yeah, just come and have a
mani-pedi with me.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.631
I'm going;
it's the right thing to do.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.733
Oh, so if I don't go,
I'm a bad person now?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.802
Cece.
Mm-hmm.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.071
I'm surprised.
I thought you, of all people,

03:26.073 --> 03:28.407
would want to accompany
your best friend

03:28.409 --> 03:32.511
to the funeral of a guy
she texted, but...

03:32.513 --> 03:34.880
I guess... not.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.153
¶ Ta-da! ¶

03:41.155 --> 03:42.387
What do you mean?

03:42.389 --> 03:44.356
What is ta-da?
We drove here together

03:44.358 --> 03:45.490
and parked
before you covered my eyes.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.359
What is
the surprise investment, Nick?

03:47.361 --> 03:48.594
The bar.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.762
Mike's selling us ten percent.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.397
I really need the cash.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.499
I got swindled
by a young gay roller skater.

03:54.501 --> 03:55.701
A rink twink.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.868
I know what
a rink twink is, Mike.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.337
Hey, 20 thou

03:58.339 --> 04:00.372
and we are part owners, okay?

04:00.374 --> 04:02.174
I've done my research.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.610
There's a consistent revenue
and no startup costs.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.111
You're really serious
about this, huh?

04:06.113 --> 04:07.746
I really want this, man.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.081
Good. I want this, too.
Good.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.016
Where are we gonna get
20 grand from?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.118
Well, we got the ten grand
we made on the Swuit.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.687
Maybe do we have any
rich friends we can
borrow money from?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.022
Well, let's think about it.
There's the middle school

04:17.024 --> 04:19.291
vice principal, there's the cop,
the gym teacher.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.093
Let's not forget about
the community college student.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.695
Whew, lot of options.
Yeah.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.863
It's tough, it's frustrating.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.798
Yeah, huh... damn it.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.433
Schimdty just had an idea.
I know that face.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.968
Give it to me, give it to me.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.936
What are you thinking,
big cat?

04:30.938 --> 04:31.937
What are you
thinking, big cat?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.005
I just...

04:35.142 --> 04:38.110
(grunts)
Think, now, if we own it,
don't be kicking it.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.712
Just... Yeah, oh.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.913
Aah!

04:41.915 --> 04:43.215
Ouch.

04:43.217 --> 04:44.549
Okay.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.452
Hey, pal, uh, what's happening?

04:47.454 --> 04:50.122
My mom still owes me
my bar mitzvah money.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.557
I mean, we can ask her,
but, you know, she's...

04:52.559 --> 04:54.626
Pushy, overbearing, controlling.
So, what?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.461
Oh, she's a typical Jewish mom?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.929
It's anti-Semitic
when you say it like that.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.331
So-so what, she likes to get
involved?

04:59.333 --> 05:00.966
That's great, you know.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.901
I don't feel very comfortable
when I'm around her.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.936
Well, boo-hoo, she thinks
you want to have sex with her.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.005
Try learning about the birds
and the bees from her

05:07.007 --> 05:08.907
using a doughnut and a banana.
By the way,

05:08.909 --> 05:11.009
neither one of which are used
for what you think they are.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.512
How could that be?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.680
Hey, want to grab a bite later?

05:14.682 --> 05:16.815
You know it, partner.
(laughs)

05:18.018 --> 05:19.484
Hey, Aly,

05:19.486 --> 05:21.186
uh, want to grab a beer
after work?

05:21.188 --> 05:23.355
Ooh...

05:23.357 --> 05:24.790
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.926
(groaning)

05:27.928 --> 05:29.661
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.996
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.765
Ooh.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.834
(humming)

05:38.372 --> 05:40.439
(grunting)

05:40.441 --> 05:41.707
(clicking tongue)

05:41.709 --> 05:43.842
Uh, ooh.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.713
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.948
No.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.017
Oh, come on.
Not work related,

05:52.019 --> 05:53.819
not interested, Bishop.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.388
We're professionals,
not friends.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.125
Oh, God. Here
we go. Showtime.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.960
Mama!
No!

06:01.962 --> 06:04.896
I was meeting my little boy,
not this handsome movie star.

06:04.898 --> 06:05.964
What are you doing with these?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.866
Why would you hide your hazels?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.635
(laughs) Hi, sweetheart.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.037
Oh!

06:12.039 --> 06:13.472
Hey, Louise,
it's really good to see you.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.906
I bet it is;
tape it down, Miller.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.242
Tape it?
Here, look at
your baby brother.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.577
How handsome is Reggie?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.345
(kisses)
Give him a kiss.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.581
Kiss your brother.
Give him a kiss.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.483
Give him a kiss; he loves it.
Kiss him, kiss him.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.818
Okay, give him a scratch.
He loves a scratch.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.420
He loves a scratch.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.389
Can I get an alcohol?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.662
So, how's Susan?

06:37.664 --> 06:40.065
Susan's my-my mom's work friend
who she lives with.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.533
Susan cuts her own firewood.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.001
Susan's my girlfriend.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.669
That's what I said,
your work friend.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.271
She's good.
We just got a new mattress.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.707
So work's been more comfortable.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.041
(chuckling)

06:50.043 --> 06:51.576
What?

06:51.578 --> 06:52.844
What-what now?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.513
Is it my sweater?
Is it too dark?

06:54.515 --> 06:55.847
It might be. Here.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.449
You got, you got me a sweater?

06:57.451 --> 06:59.451
Mm-hmm.
Now that's nice.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.919
That's nice.
Try it on.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.053
I'm trying, I'm put-putting
it on right now.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.188
It goes over your head.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.556
He's putting a sweater
on a sweater?

07:04.558 --> 07:05.891
Get over it.
Get over it.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.059
That's nice, very nice.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.761
Thank you so much.
I love this so much.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.363
Schmidt, isn't there something

07:11.365 --> 07:12.697
you want to ask
your mother about?

07:12.699 --> 07:13.799
SCHMIDT:
Well,

07:13.801 --> 07:15.700
I did...
I did want to ask you about...

07:15.702 --> 07:16.902
Your voice is wavering.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.537
Here, have some chocolate.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.938
No, Mom, I'm okay. Thank you.
Have it.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.373
Here, have it, have it, have it.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.707
I'll just have one.
Have it, have it.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.643
Have it, have it.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.745
There you go.
I do love it. Hmm!

07:26.747 --> 07:28.980
So, I... What I was thinking
about was...

07:28.982 --> 07:30.415
uh...

07:30.417 --> 07:32.751
my bar mitzvah money.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.053
Can I have it?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.823
Oh, my God!
Of course you can! Yes.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.958
Oh, that was...
yeah, so easy.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.493
As soon as you write
your thank-you notes.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.961
You didn't forget,
did you?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.062
He never did
his thank-you cards.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.130
SCHMIDT:
Mom, I just thought that

07:45.132 --> 07:46.231
you know,
that was so long ago...

07:46.233 --> 07:47.599
Well, you know.
If I just gave you

07:47.601 --> 07:49.100
the money, what kind
of lesson would that be?

07:49.102 --> 07:50.502
You finish your cards,
you get the money.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.803
That's fair, isn't it?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.738
You didn't finish
your thank-you cards?

07:53.740 --> 07:55.207
There's a hat in the bag, too.
Try it on.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.010
Put it on.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.278
That's very nice.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.147
Take it off,
you're in a restaurant.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.485
Sure about this?
It's not too late to bail.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.752
We're going.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.521
It's the right thing to do.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.756
Look, we'll be in and out
of there in five minutes.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.859
It'll be so packed,
no one will notice.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.966
(whispering):
The right thing to do.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.701
Is it?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.539
...and, uh, Pete said,

08:27.541 --> 08:29.274
"If you gotta
puke, Duffy,

08:29.276 --> 08:30.842
just puke."

08:30.844 --> 08:32.310
Almost time to tell the story

08:32.312 --> 08:33.979
about your close friend Pete.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.547
I'm just gonna
tell the truth.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.781
We went on a few dates.
That's it.

08:36.783 --> 08:37.816
I'm Val,

08:37.818 --> 08:39.351
Pete's girlfriend.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.622
(sobs) I'm sorry.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.956
Would you mind going?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.391
How did you know Pete?

08:49.630 --> 08:51.062
(clears throat quietly)

08:51.064 --> 08:52.364
Um, from work.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.798
We worked together.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.966
You're a sports agent, too?

08:54.968 --> 08:57.636
Wow...
Yep.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.238
Okay, we got a lot of
thank-you cards to write

09:00.240 --> 09:01.806
and not a lot
of time.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.375
Let's get into it.
I'll start, okay?

09:03.377 --> 09:04.743
Let's go,
here we go.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.977
"To whom

09:05.979 --> 09:07.812
"it may

09:07.814 --> 09:10.815
concern..."
To... to whom it may concern?

09:10.817 --> 09:12.484
I'm on a vibe.
Nick, these need
to have personal details.

09:12.486 --> 09:13.985
My mom is gonna check them.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.186
All right, then get me
the guest list.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.721
Where have you imagined
that I've been holding

09:16.723 --> 09:18.390
onto the guest list
for all these years?

09:18.392 --> 09:19.925
Just carrying it around in
my wallet? This is impossible.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.594
This is gonna take
some serious detective work.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.929
(chuckles)

09:23.931 --> 09:25.397
It's a good thing
I can call backup.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.701
Hey.
You said this was a work thing.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.902
It is a work thing.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.737
It's a... work-style thing.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.239
You see, we need
your skills to solve

09:34.241 --> 09:36.341
a cold case.

09:37.711 --> 09:41.746
(hip-hop playing)

09:41.748 --> 09:44.449
¶ ¶

09:44.451 --> 09:46.918
ALY: Hey, you want your bar
mitzvah money? Tell me her name.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.120
I don't remember.
I don't believe you!

09:49.122 --> 09:51.189
Just relax. Relax.
Here, Schmidt.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.959
Sip that.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.694
Want to hear
the music again?

09:55.696 --> 09:57.128
(hip-hop music playing)

09:57.130 --> 09:58.363
All right, there we go.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.632
Uh-huh.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.033
Yeah, you're 13 years old,

10:02.035 --> 10:03.301
everybody's feeling it...

10:05.105 --> 10:07.038
¶ Motown Philly's
back again... ¶
Enough.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.206
What was her name?!

10:08.208 --> 10:09.274
Sharon Rosenberg!

10:11.612 --> 10:13.712
Okay. 257 Sea Cove Drive, 11021.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.617
Okay. "Dear Mrs. Rosenberg...

10:18.619 --> 10:19.884
Thank you for
the check."

10:19.886 --> 10:21.653
I need a personal detail!
Personal detail!

10:21.655 --> 10:22.721
She had a pool.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.556
"Cannonball!

10:24.558 --> 10:27.559
Love, Schmidt."
WINSTON:
Cannonball!

10:27.561 --> 10:29.427
Okay, Schmidt.
All right, Schmidt.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.162
Who's this guy?
SCHMIDT:
I don't know, Winston.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.430
It's too far away, I can't tell.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.999
Uh... enhance,
enhance, enhance...

10:34.001 --> 10:35.133
Okay, too far, too far.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.068
Dehance, dehance.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.770
Scott Rubenstein!
Scott Rubenstein.

10:38.772 --> 10:39.904
My mom's CPA.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.173
Scott Rubenstein...

10:42.175 --> 10:43.975
deceased.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.911
Yes!

10:46.913 --> 10:48.079
Yes!

10:48.081 --> 10:50.015
Love the dead ones.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.584
You know, Pete wasn't
just a sports agent.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.619
He understood sports.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.855
Like, he knew the rules,
all of them:

10:56.857 --> 10:58.590
offsides,

10:58.592 --> 11:01.526
unnecessary bumping,

11:01.528 --> 11:04.663
what happens if you hit a bird
with the ball you throw...

11:04.665 --> 11:06.297
Excuse-excuse me.
Can I, uh, borrow
her for a second?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.766
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.833
What's up?
Uh...

11:08.835 --> 11:10.802
what the hell
are you doing?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.270
I'm trying to save
that poor girl's feelings.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.705
If she knew the truth,
it would shatter her.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.206
I am going to
the nail salon, okay?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.708
Bye.
Cece...
I'm out.

11:16.710 --> 11:17.776
Hey, wait! Guys, wait.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.345
No, stop... guys.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.280
The only sport I know
is Ricky Ball,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.282
and I'm pretty sure
my friend Ricky made that up.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.251
No. Lying about who you are
is not the right thing to do.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.653
I am going.
Coach...

11:28.655 --> 11:30.355
(whimpering)
Is this, uh...

11:30.357 --> 11:32.290
is this Pete's thing?
He was my agent.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.792
Of course he was.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.961
Who else would represent
NFL star JJ Watt?

11:36.963 --> 11:40.065
Uh, Pete was my best
friend and, uh...

11:40.067 --> 11:42.967
God, it's good to see you.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.469
LOUISE:
<i>Wouldn't the couch</i>

11:44.471 --> 11:46.805
be better over there?
All that light?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.907
Or do you like to live
like a radish, underground?

11:48.909 --> 11:52.377
So we worked really hard
on the... on the cards.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.412
Let's see
what we got.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.215
Okay.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.817
But you know
what would be better?

11:58.819 --> 11:59.851
Connie's
into gardening.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.386
You should mention that.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.221
And if you really want
your card to pop,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.989
you can use a nice fountain pen

12:04.991 --> 12:06.691
on silver stationery.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.426
And you should sign your
full name, not just Schmidt.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.395
I mean, you have
a lovely first name.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.263
Great! I'll just make
all those changes, Mom!

12:15.836 --> 12:18.002
(door slams)
Okay.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.739
You're not getting me into your
pants, you little jackhammer.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.674
Oh, I don't want you
in my pants, Louise.

12:22.676 --> 12:24.008
Okay.
Okay.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.844
Okay.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.082
So then Pete says to...
Allen Iverson.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.184
"...you want to keep
sportsing on the...
"Grizzlies.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.786
JESS:
"...but if you want me

12:34.788 --> 12:36.454
"to show you
the money, then...

12:36.456 --> 12:39.023
You gotta finish your career
off with the '76ers!"

12:39.025 --> 12:42.026
(chuckles)
And it was
classic Pete.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.863
It's so nice to remember work
as more than just a thing

12:44.865 --> 12:46.431
that kept Pete
on the phone all the time.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.133
You're very welcome.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.734
Oh, Val, you should
have Pete's phone.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.970
All those memories
and photos...

12:51.972 --> 12:53.271
It's in the garage
with all his stuff.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.706
I'll give it to you
before you go.

12:54.708 --> 12:55.974
VAL: Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.781
Okay, we gotta find that phone
before Val sees the sext.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.449
Yes, it is the
right thing to do.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.551
Like I've said all along.
I got a good thing going

13:06.553 --> 13:07.919
with JJ and I'm not
gonna let you ruin it.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.487
That's the funeral spirit.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.893
What are you guys doing in here?

13:14.895 --> 13:16.461
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for
Pete's phone.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.329
So are we!
Did you sext him, too?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.265
No.
I fired Pete over text,

13:20.267 --> 13:22.133
so I didn't want
to crush his family.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.635
That's why I'm at the memorial.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.603
Not because it was
the right thing to do?

13:25.605 --> 13:27.172
No. No. I mean,
we never even went skiing.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.506
Who makes up
these rules?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.175
Now...

13:30.177 --> 13:31.476
What are you guys
doing out here?

13:31.478 --> 13:32.677
Um...
Singing.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.480
S... What?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.016
We like to sing.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.617
Together. About...

13:39.619 --> 13:40.585
Sports.
Food.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.153
Sports foods.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.321
VAL:
That's fun.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.256
It's...

13:45.258 --> 13:47.192
Would you guys...

13:47.194 --> 13:50.195
Would it be putting you on the
spot if I asked you to do one?

13:50.197 --> 13:50.995
I think that wouldn't be
appropriate.
COACH: Actually, yes.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.030
I feel like it's a little...

13:52.032 --> 13:55.533
¶ Hot dogs ¶

13:55.535 --> 13:58.169
¶ Hot dogs... ¶

13:58.171 --> 14:02.473
¶ Everybody loves hot dogs ¶

14:02.475 --> 14:05.143
¶ Hot dogs ¶
¶ Dogs ¶

14:05.145 --> 14:08.112

14:08.114 --> 14:09.514
¶ Hot dogs ¶

14:09.516 --> 14:12.951
¶ Pretzels! ¶

14:15.121 --> 14:16.454
Whoa, partner!

14:16.456 --> 14:17.622
Wait up! (laughs)

14:17.624 --> 14:19.023
That work-style

14:19.025 --> 14:20.391
thing was pretty fun.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.826
Let's parlay that into a beer.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.128
My buddy has a bar
he works at, down the street.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.297
It's carpeted, so...

14:26.299 --> 14:28.333
Bishop, what don't you get?

14:28.335 --> 14:29.968
No.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.970
(SUV door opens, shuts)

14:31.972 --> 14:34.839
(engine starts)

14:34.841 --> 14:37.141
Are you okay?

14:37.143 --> 14:39.010
Oh, hey, man. Thanks.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.979
Yeah, I don't know, man.
It's just...
(shushes)

14:40.981 --> 14:42.347
I'm talking to a ladybug.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.082
Squeeze my hand!

14:44.084 --> 14:46.484
Just one more push!
You're almost there!

14:46.486 --> 14:49.087
The first child is
always the hardest!

14:50.156 --> 14:51.322
Hey, bud.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.491
Hard candy?
Is it butterscotch?

14:53.493 --> 14:56.261
No, 'cause we're
friggin' strangers.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.263
(laughs):
"Is it butterscotch?"

14:58.265 --> 15:00.265
So, you freaked out
a little back there,

15:00.267 --> 15:02.066
didn't you?

15:02.068 --> 15:04.502
Not to use some
popsicle psychology...

15:04.504 --> 15:06.037
"Popsicle psychology"?

15:06.039 --> 15:07.605
Yeah, it's pop
psychology for short.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.240
'Cause, you know,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.009
you eat the popsicle
and you love it so much

15:11.011 --> 15:13.278
and then you're stuck
holding the-the stick?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.680
You get it. you get it.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.181
Not really, but...
I think you have

15:17.183 --> 15:20.618
some pent-up resentment
towards your mom.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.020
She's trying to control you!

15:22.022 --> 15:23.554
She treats you
like a little baby

15:23.556 --> 15:25.390
who can't do
anything for himself.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.025
That's why I never wrote
the cards in the first place.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.960
Go tell that to your mom!

15:28.962 --> 15:30.895
She'll understand.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.530
I don't understand.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.933
The couch looks good here
though, doesn't it?

15:34.935 --> 15:36.467
It opens up the whole room.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.403
Louise, I think what your boy
is trying to say is...

15:38.405 --> 15:40.104
Shut it, Nick.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.073
Honey, why do you
hang out with him?

15:42.075 --> 15:46.077
You know Nancy Borkow?
Her son just moved to L.A.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.879
He wrote a movie script
for the movies.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.948
I can connect you.
You need better friends!

15:49.950 --> 15:52.150
Enough, Mom!

15:52.152 --> 15:53.451
You don't get to choose
my friends!

15:53.453 --> 15:54.886
You don't get
to choose anything!

15:54.888 --> 15:57.322
Because this is my life!

15:57.324 --> 16:01.225
It's my dream and nothing's
gonna stop me now!

16:01.227 --> 16:03.561
It feels like
that's from something.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.964
It feels like, it feels like
it's from a movie or something.
¶ My life ¶

16:05.966 --> 16:07.999
Yeah, I think it's
a song. It's a song.
Like some sort of song, right?

16:08.001 --> 16:09.834
It's the<i> Perfect Stranger</i> theme.
Well, you know,

16:09.836 --> 16:11.235
it doesn't matter!

16:11.237 --> 16:12.603
You know, we did a good job
with those cards, Mom.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.238
And we don't need
any of your money.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.240
Whoa, we're all
being very emotional.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.342
Let's just slow everything...

16:17.344 --> 16:19.210
I'm moving the couch back!

16:22.082 --> 16:23.348
Gosh!

16:25.318 --> 16:26.951
Did you nail that thing down?

16:26.953 --> 16:29.287
That's... You move that
all by yourself?

16:29.289 --> 16:31.122
I'm an adult man, Mom.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.757
And Nick is my best friend
in the whole wide world.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.592
And we're gonna buy
a small portion of that bar

16:34.594 --> 16:37.161
without any of your help.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.099
(sighs)
(door slams)

16:42.602 --> 16:44.369
And also, there's some leftover
chili in the fridge

16:44.371 --> 16:46.204
if you get hungry,
and, please, make sure

16:46.206 --> 16:48.306
to put a plate over it before
you put it in the microwave.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.375
I don't want it
to splatter everywhere!

16:52.545 --> 16:54.679
¶ And that's why they call it ¶

16:54.681 --> 16:57.181
¶ The out-of-peanuts ¶

16:57.183 --> 16:59.384
¶ Blues... ¶

16:59.386 --> 17:03.588
¶ Stadium taco. ¶

17:07.193 --> 17:10.461
Thank you guys for being a
bright spot on my sad day.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.230
(screams)
Aah!

17:12.232 --> 17:13.631
Shucks!
Sorry!

17:13.633 --> 17:15.400
I thought I saw Pete's ghost!

17:15.402 --> 17:17.735
It was a paint can.
(laughs)

17:17.737 --> 17:19.037
(all chuckle)
Are you sure about...?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.639
Ugh! We gotta find
this phone.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.141
And get the hell out of here.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.075
Okay, it's ringing.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.544
Can anybody hear it?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.147
(cell phone ringing)
Oh, no, no, no,

17:29.149 --> 17:30.348
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

17:30.350 --> 17:32.817
There's another box.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.420
What the hell...?
"Property of Pete"?

17:35.422 --> 17:38.089
He made my sext his caller I.D.?

17:38.091 --> 17:40.491
This is a sext?

17:42.395 --> 17:43.961
JJ fired him over text!

17:49.869 --> 17:51.369
After the day I had,
I needed this.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.104
Me, too.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.372
What happened?

17:54.374 --> 17:55.706
I know you were
talking to yourself.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.108
Now you're talking
to a stranger.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.576
Get over it.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.179
Is that a crime in California?
What happened?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.448
I got dragged
to a random dude's funeral.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.283
Who dragged you?
My friend. She always thinks

18:05.285 --> 18:06.617
she knows what's best.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.087
Who's your friend-- me?
(both laugh)

18:09.089 --> 18:11.289
No.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.958
I got accused of that today
by my son.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.593
He's tired of me
babying him.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.929
But he's my baby,
so what am I supposed to do?

18:17.931 --> 18:19.597
Maybe you have
to let go a little.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.234
This is why strangers talk.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.936
You're a genius.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.205
Want to see a picture of my son?
He's handsome.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.373
Nah. I'm kind of in love
with my ex, so...

18:29.375 --> 18:32.076
All right, you can't
date him anyway.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.278
You're not Jewish, so over
my dead body and all that.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.813
(laughs)

18:35.815 --> 18:37.548
(laughs)

18:37.550 --> 18:39.717
Today was not a win for me.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.419
It's the right thing to do.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.554
I don't even know
what that means.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.323
Well, you made today
about yourself.
Mm.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.092
Not to use popcorn psychology,
but it's human nature.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.228
You know? Soon as I saw
JJ walk in, I was, like,

18:50.230 --> 18:51.662
"JJ Watt, be my best friend."

18:51.664 --> 18:52.763
(both chuckle)

18:52.765 --> 18:54.432
(sighs)

18:54.434 --> 18:56.134
I got to do something.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.635
Should I tell Aly off? Uh...

18:57.637 --> 18:59.504
put in for a new partner?

18:59.506 --> 19:00.638
What's the right thing
to do here?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.740
I can say with 100% certainty

19:02.742 --> 19:04.308
I have no idea.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.477
Look at you. I'm proud of you.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.412
I learned from the best.
That's awesome.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.581
What a wonderful moment
we're having today!

19:10.583 --> 19:11.816
You know what?
I'll figure it out myself.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.918
Thank you.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.686
This is from
that sixth grader over there.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.688
(quietly):
Hmm?

19:20.660 --> 19:24.095
Aly, what are you doing here?

19:24.097 --> 19:25.630
I just wanted to explain.
Look...

19:25.632 --> 19:28.766
I hung out a lot
with my last partner.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.035
And we got close and...

19:31.037 --> 19:32.336
You shot him?
What?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.437
He died?
No.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.505
Oh, my goodness... is he...?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.506
Did he survive?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.607
What are you talking about?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.009
How did you partner die?

19:38.011 --> 19:39.377
He didn't die!

19:39.379 --> 19:40.311
So, what's your point?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.679
He just fell in love with me!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.047
Oh... oh! Oh!
Yeah.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.448
Ooh...
And it messed everything up.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.884
And I just don't want
that to happen again.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.054
Damn, you're conceited!

19:50.056 --> 19:51.622
Don't nobody want your babies.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.191
I know that now!

19:53.193 --> 19:54.392
I mean, you brought
me to your loft

19:54.394 --> 19:56.127
and showed me a
bar mitzvah video.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.728
Friends?
Cool, cool.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.631
Just, uh... don't go
falling in love with me.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.800
'Cause I'm lovable as hell.
Okay.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.734
I think I'll be okay.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.369
All right.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.746
Another!

20:15.748 --> 20:17.548
(whoops)

20:17.550 --> 20:19.350
Oh, my.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.751
Michael...

20:20.753 --> 20:22.653
we'd like to buy
your share of the bar.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.856
And although we don't
have the full $20,000
at the present...

20:25.858 --> 20:28.659
You don't have the money? No.
But we're the right guys.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.927
No, the right guys
would have the money.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.429
Or Kieran Culkin's mouth.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.264
How about Owen Wilson's nose?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.699
(groans)

20:34.701 --> 20:36.234
Mom?

20:38.338 --> 20:39.337
Oh, my God!

20:39.339 --> 20:40.605
Schmidt, is this your mom?

20:40.607 --> 20:41.839
Hi. I've heard
so much about you.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.574
How's Long Island?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.675
Any cute Schmidt stories?

20:44.677 --> 20:46.244
I need less from you.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.578
Okay.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.514
I met a Mexican woman
at the nail salon...

20:50.516 --> 20:53.217
who made me realize...

20:53.219 --> 20:54.919
I need to let go.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.354
You're a man.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.623
And you deserve
your bar mitzvah money.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.958
Thanks, Mom.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.562
Mike, we want to buy
your ten percent of the bar.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.430
This bar?!

21:06.432 --> 21:09.033
There's a dying catfish laying
on the sidewalk out front!

21:09.035 --> 21:11.469
This would be a hilarious time
for me to back out...

21:11.471 --> 21:12.603
but okay.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.472
Yes! We're part owners!

21:14.474 --> 21:17.541
BOTH (chanting):
We're part owners!

21:18.711 --> 21:21.479
How great is this moment?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.447
I just think you'd be
more of a success socially

21:23.449 --> 21:26.550
if you let people come to you.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.386
You know what's fun?

21:28.388 --> 21:30.721
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
until we're best friends.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.591
(groans)

21:33.593 --> 21:34.592
JESS:
<i>Nick, can you believe it?</i>

21:34.594 --> 21:35.793
You're a bar owner.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.827
I'm so proud of you.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.663
None of this would've happened

21:38.665 --> 21:42.767
without Schmidt
standing up to his mom.
It was so scary.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.636
I can't believe I missed her.
We still can use the other
90% of the bar, right?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.905
Y-Yes.
You know that's not
how it works, right?

21:47.907 --> 21:50.007
This is just my favorite
section. I wanted to...
It's a financial share.
