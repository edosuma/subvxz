01:43.704 --> 01:47.417
- If you stop me now, I won't
be able to do the restore.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.153
My life's work.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.025
- Nobody works here you see.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.362
I mean I'm Mr. Brooks, but
nobody works here anymore.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.254
I don't...

03:46.960 --> 03:48.396
Well okay.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.481
Unbelievable.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.229
Guy says he works here.
- That's good.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.323
- No that's not good.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.430
- This is so odd.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.147
- Okay I'll bite, what is it?

04:31.171 --> 04:33.583
- Okay so you know
how toy makers

04:33.607 --> 04:36.620
were a specialty profession,
kind of like a butcher,

04:36.644 --> 04:39.589
et cetera, so on and
so forth right?

04:39.613 --> 04:43.293
Well each customer in this
book represents a ledger

04:43.317 --> 04:46.119
like a checklist
of each toy made.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.123
Empty.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.277
- Maybe he just didn't
get around to it.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.313
It's not that hard
to figure out.

05:03.337 --> 05:07.541
Or maybe it got lost amongst the
rest of the crap over here.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.413
- Yeah, all great theories,

05:13.213 --> 05:17.418
except he wasn't
making different toys.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.654
It's the same toy.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.544
- Monteya, come on.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.217
Come on be careful,
what are you doing?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.162
Come on now didn't I tell you

05:53.186 --> 05:55.756
to be careful with
what you touch?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.252
Ow.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.356
Huh.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.592
Finally something works.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.807
Whoever can use that...

08:17.097 --> 08:25.038
Whoever accepts this gift will
be the soul of its contents.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.200
"You are part of a wild hunt."

09:17.224 --> 09:19.402
Any attempt to
interrupt the nature

09:19.426 --> 09:22.129
"of its intent
will lead to end."

09:23.230 --> 09:27.334
"Be warned that it
sees all and punishes.

09:28.401 --> 09:36.401
You are granted removal of one
name from this... naughty list."

12:14.401 --> 12:15.879
- Hey.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.647
- Wait I thought you said
you were at a toy shop

12:18.671 --> 12:22.910
which is kind of pedophile-ish
but I didn't want to judge.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.428
- Sky, why are you calling me?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.254
I told you to wait for my call.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.334
- Wait are you in any trouble?

12:38.358 --> 12:40.937
Because if you need me there
before Christmas just let me know.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.072
- Wait, where is Nick again?

12:43.096 --> 12:46.142
- Nick is in the back, and
what I really, really need

12:46.166 --> 12:49.702
is for you to not know so
much about the big surprise.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.414
- Why not?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.140
- Because you have a big mouth.

12:54.041 --> 12:57.377
- Okay, so that's how
this is gonna go?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.113
Where's Nick?

13:01.481 --> 13:02.926
- He's in the back.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.718
- So, he's in the
back, by himself?

13:06.353 --> 13:07.353
- Yeah.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.790
- You must really hate
your boyfriend, huh?

13:11.291 --> 13:15.195
- Uh, fiancÃ© and what why?

13:16.563 --> 13:20.443
- You're letting him touch
all this old and creepy shit

13:20.467 --> 13:24.704
without a gun or a priest
or a shaman, nothing?

13:25.839 --> 13:27.716
Now you know what, hey
send me the address

13:27.740 --> 13:30.553
where you're gonna have
this little party.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.512
I'm gonna have my
cousin Yelp it.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.725
- Sky the party is on Christmas

13:36.749 --> 13:39.896
and you know how Nick feels
about that time of year.

13:45.893 --> 13:49.738
- Wait so you invited the
entire neighborhood or?

13:49.762 --> 13:53.076
- Yeah, yeah I invited
a few people.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.811
- Yeah that's some really
crazy shit right there.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.347
Having a bunch of
random people over.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.493
- Yeah, if you, if you
could see this place

14:10.517 --> 14:13.429
you would know that that's
not gonna be an issue.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.431
- That's racist.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.766
- No, no what I'm saying
is that this place

14:17.790 --> 14:20.403
is literally stuck in the 30's.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.863
- You realize that's
still racist right?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.242
- Okay what I mean is
that there's no one here

14:26.266 --> 14:28.701
under the age of 90, I mean,

14:30.470 --> 14:31.939
there's no traffic,

14:34.474 --> 14:36.076
no birds,

14:37.444 --> 14:38.979
there's no kids.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.129
- Hey, wait, what's going on?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.468
- I'm okay.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.268
- Hey have you seen The Village?

15:25.292 --> 15:26.426
- I gotta go.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.762
I'll call you later.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.578
- Okay whatever.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.137
I'll remember that.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.360
- "I accept this
gift from Woo-Don."

17:39.592 --> 17:42.438
I guess it was the
last thing he made,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.931
but the whole thing was odd.

17:46.266 --> 17:51.614
I'm not even sure I
saw whatever it was.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.116
I'm just happy for
it to be appraised

17:53.140 --> 17:54.383
and then we can move
on with our lives...

17:54.407 --> 17:55.975
- Do you want to marry me?

18:02.415 --> 18:03.616
- What?

18:04.984 --> 18:06.953
- You heard what I said.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.991
Do you want to marry me?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.163
- Of course.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.843
- Well you know what this
holiday means to me.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.845
- Yes, and I'm trying.

18:22.869 --> 18:26.315
- Look, we've spent the
majority of our time

18:26.339 --> 18:28.251
celebrating an old shop.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.177
I mean we hardly even talk.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.923
I feel like I know nothing
about your life here,

18:34.947 --> 18:36.616
the people, the town.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.558
- I've never kept anything
from you, Victoria.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.895
- Why can't we meet your mom?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.334
- She uh...

18:58.070 --> 18:59.348
I've already told you why.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.709
- Well I want to know
again, tell me again.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.691
I'm serious, if we're
gonna get married

19:08.715 --> 19:12.561
then I need to meet at least
one person in your family,

19:12.585 --> 19:15.021
a cousin, an uncle, anyone.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.409
What are you doing,
why are we stopping?

20:16.583 --> 20:18.794
- Sir, hey.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.287
Are you okay?

20:25.124 --> 20:27.936
Sir, you've been in an accident,

20:27.960 --> 20:30.897
is there anyone you
want me to call?

20:38.271 --> 20:41.140
- I'm going to get
into so much trouble.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.615
- Sir, you're gonna be-sir,

20:49.015 --> 20:51.584
who's going to be mad at you?

21:25.818 --> 21:26.818
- Hey.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.823
Nick?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.361
- Let's get to the house.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.331
- Okay let's just
not talk about it.

22:09.228 --> 22:10.397
Listen.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.433
Christmas music.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.769
I better go and turn
that right off.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.573
- Really?

22:21.708 --> 22:23.719
- I think I'm gonna
make some hot chocolate

22:23.743 --> 22:25.854
but don't worry I
wouldn't even dream

22:25.878 --> 22:28.223
of putting marshmallows in it.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.301
- Honey.

22:50.903 --> 22:54.883
- I'll be fine just
not right now okay?

22:56.976 --> 22:59.311
- Victoria.
- Oh my god.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.582
What?

23:09.622 --> 23:11.090
Are you serious?

23:13.593 --> 23:14.794
Is this a joke?

23:19.331 --> 23:20.332
Whatever.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.084
Nice try and all, but,

23:29.108 --> 23:32.344
this is not what I meant
by Christmas spirit.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.325
That thing is creepy
as shit by the way.

23:54.333 --> 23:57.970
Okay, I get that it's weird

23:58.337 --> 24:01.440
but it is not that
much of a big deal.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.811
What's up with you?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.616
- I didn't bring it.

24:12.351 --> 24:13.553
- Yeah.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.490
Why does it have
that creepy blade?

25:06.205 --> 25:09.508
So, I'm assuming you
found it like that?

25:12.612 --> 25:14.080
- Yeah but,

25:18.450 --> 25:19.752
it ran.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.757
- It ran?

25:28.861 --> 25:32.031
- Yeah and it marked
me with a seal.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.368
- A seal?

25:41.808 --> 25:45.645
- And it's right
here on my left arm.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.586
- Yeah.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.658
Damn, I hate it
when that happens.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.207
When I was young my
Sally See and Say spoke

26:05.231 --> 26:07.634
without me pulling her cord.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.137
You know what I did?

26:13.472 --> 26:14.841
I chucked it.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.310
Bye you creepy son of a bitch.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.352
- Oh.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.467
Done.

27:16.635 --> 27:20.015
No more trouble from Santa's
creepy little helper.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.050
- What'd you do with him?

27:22.074 --> 27:24.176
- It is in the trash.

27:28.547 --> 27:29.547
- Okay.

27:30.516 --> 27:33.853
I'm gonna take a shower, and uh,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.022
I might crash.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.553
- Well we stayed at my house

27:58.577 --> 28:00.255
and why is that even weird?

28:00.279 --> 28:02.581
How man guys know
where you live?

28:04.350 --> 28:06.085
- That's a fair point.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.365
But wait so you're in
the middle of nowhere

28:10.389 --> 28:13.168
with a guy who's having
killing your ass flashbacks.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.671
- No no no they're not flashbacks
they're night terrors.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.406
- Night terrors my ass,

28:18.430 --> 28:20.375
have you seen Amityville Horror?

28:20.399 --> 28:22.301
- No, what's that?

28:23.369 --> 28:25.714
- It's what you're
living right now.

28:25.738 --> 28:30.252
Look girl there is so many
new dating apps right now.

28:30.276 --> 28:34.757
I say you call it all off
and you come back home

28:34.781 --> 28:36.024
before you get chopped up

28:36.048 --> 28:37.893
into little baby
pieces in your sleep.

28:37.917 --> 28:41.287
- Listen he's not crazy, I mean,

28:41.553 --> 28:44.900
yeah okay, he's got issues.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.235
- This is all my fault.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.104
I should have let
you use my account

28:49.128 --> 28:50.272
so you could stream
more movies...

28:50.296 --> 28:53.075
- Okay listen there's
one more thing.

28:53.099 --> 28:56.478
There was this really creepy elf

28:56.502 --> 28:58.971
waiting on us when we got home.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.419
- Like real elf?
- No it's dumb.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.554
- Ah so he's into elves.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.424
- Never mind, never mind.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.993
Look it's Christmas
Eve and the 'rents

29:11.017 --> 29:13.328
are gonna be here any second

29:13.352 --> 29:15.497
so I love you.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.800
- Alright alright
I love you too.

29:17.824 --> 29:22.570
But as your friend I'm
obligated to say this-run.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.762
- Bye.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.622
Hey, hey,

31:31.590 --> 31:33.068
Hey, you're ok.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.437
Hey, hey it's okay, I'm
here, I'm here, I'm here,

31:35.461 --> 31:37.572
I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.432
It's okay, it's okay, come here.

31:53.479 --> 31:54.656
- That's it.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.748
- Nick what just
happened in there?

31:56.983 --> 32:00.786
- Just pack up whatever
you got and let's go.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.332
Don't just stand there,
let's go, let's move.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.525
- Nick it's Christmas Eve.

32:08.494 --> 32:11.930
And there's a major snow
storm heading this way.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.642
- Okay,

32:14.666 --> 32:15.978
there cannot be.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.870
- Yeah all flights
are being canceled.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.784
- Shit.
- Nick.

32:22.808 --> 32:25.044
Wait, wait, Nick, Nick, wait.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.991
- Surprise.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.729
- Well say something, son.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.668
- Speechless?
- John.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.040
Speechless.
- We spoke about this.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.977
- Yes, yes we did.

32:59.378 --> 33:05.851
- So, as a family we are so
excited to celebrate one of many

33:06.352 --> 33:09.988
and just thrilled to be here.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.726
- Well it's a party isn't it?

33:16.362 --> 33:19.331
Special, all the way
from Greenland.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.278
To the man of the house.

33:35.747 --> 33:36.748
- Excuse me.

33:37.549 --> 33:38.684
What?

33:43.689 --> 33:46.024
- Here, it's okay Dad just...

33:48.060 --> 33:49.871
- Oh boy.

34:00.972 --> 34:02.208
- Hey.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.523
- I just wanna...

34:08.547 --> 34:10.116
- Surprise?

34:12.818 --> 34:15.630
- You just couldn't
resist could you?

34:15.654 --> 34:19.125
- Oh come on that's not fair.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.764
- You knew how much
this shit meant to me.

34:26.331 --> 34:29.801
- Yeah but you know how
much family means to me.

34:50.956 --> 34:53.135
Look it's Christmas
Eve and my family

34:53.159 --> 34:55.270
and my parents are
right out there

34:55.293 --> 34:58.106
and I even invited some
people from the town.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.431
- You did what?

34:59.931 --> 35:03.502
- Yeah, from the place
that you grew up in.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.272
- Born, I didn't grow up here.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.308
- Okay, whatever.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.854
- And I told you the only
thing that I want to do

35:12.878 --> 35:14.088
is I want to appraise this place

35:14.112 --> 35:15.657
and get the fuck out of here.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.125
- You actually haven't
told me much of anything.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.851
I don't know a thing about you.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.639
- Well I for one
never cared much

35:31.663 --> 35:34.132
about the buzz during
this time of year.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.907
- Pops where you going?

35:43.642 --> 35:45.887
- Going to get my
own special bottle

35:45.911 --> 35:48.414
and it ain't from no
damn Greenland either.

35:48.747 --> 35:49.824
Come on, Martha.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.551
- Ma.
- I like his take on that.

35:53.819 --> 35:54.819
- Ma.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.690
Dad there's a storm coming.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.328
- Screw it, god damn.

36:08.734 --> 36:12.838
- I guess maybe three
months is a little fast.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.751
Even for us.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.882
- It's Christmas Eve.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.787
My family and friends
are out there, so.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.881
- I don't think it
is safe to drive.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.583
- Then why did you come?

36:48.607 --> 36:51.277
- Because you are as blind
as a bat, that's why.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.980
- Which explains 50
plus years no doubt.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.784
God it is freezing.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.721
- Well if you had worn
what I put out for you...

37:05.056 --> 37:06.458
- Wait a second.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.596
Do you hear that, hmm?

37:12.498 --> 37:14.876
Silence.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.503
- This close, you
are this close.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.011
- What the hell is this?

37:27.112 --> 37:28.956
- What is this?

37:28.980 --> 37:30.582
- I just said that.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.485
- What is this doing in our car?

37:36.488 --> 37:39.401
- Funny lookin' thing isn't it?

37:57.776 --> 38:01.179
- Can you believe him?
- You know how he is.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.116
He hasn't been the
same ever since.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.388
Anyways.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.459
So... three months.

38:16.962 --> 38:17.963
- Oh my god.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.070
- Starting to understand
the idea of cold feet.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.041
I don't know.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.527
Do you think I'm
making a mistake?

38:39.551 --> 38:43.321
- Oh hey, it's not
for me to say.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.425
Only you know what's
good for you.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.842
- Earlier, we were at the shop

38:54.866 --> 38:58.504
which by the way is
this whole other story,

38:59.004 --> 39:02.874
and I was looking out the
window and there was,

39:03.909 --> 39:06.412
this old man shoveling snow.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.283
- Okay and?

39:13.385 --> 39:16.855
- And there was no snow.

39:25.397 --> 39:28.567
Then we get home and
Nick has this...

39:30.135 --> 39:34.382
little elf thing propped
up, waiting on us.

39:34.406 --> 39:38.185
It's the creepiest thing that
I've ever seen in my life.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.455
And if you know
Nick, you know that

39:40.479 --> 39:43.415
that just makes no sense at all.

39:44.315 --> 39:47.385
- Right, and what
does that mean?

39:47.619 --> 39:48.563
- Nick...

39:48.587 --> 39:52.967
he hates Christmas,
absolutely loathes it

39:52.991 --> 39:56.962
because he had an incident
when he was younger where...

40:04.069 --> 40:08.750
Let's just say the last thing
that Nick would ever do

40:08.774 --> 40:13.655
is touch anything and I mean
anything Christmas related.

40:13.679 --> 40:17.082
- Okay so why do you
think that he did it?

40:25.356 --> 40:26.858
- I guess,

40:29.595 --> 40:33.575
I guess he's having second
feelings about the wedding

40:33.599 --> 40:37.144
and him acting out of character

40:37.168 --> 40:39.605
is his way of showing me that.

40:40.205 --> 40:43.374
- Okay, big sister card.

40:44.275 --> 40:48.289
I think that you've
had way, way too much

40:48.313 --> 40:51.617
of this Greenland eggnog.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.295
- That stuff was gross.

40:54.319 --> 40:57.723
- Yeah that's why nobody
goes to Greenland, honey.

41:02.494 --> 41:04.563
- Tiffany you seen Papa?

41:06.532 --> 41:08.299
- I thought they came back?

41:18.744 --> 41:22.047
- Well they should've
been back by now.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.227
You know maybe I should
go and try to find them.

41:26.251 --> 41:27.553
- No.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.197
No you're gonna stay right here,

41:30.221 --> 41:32.423
and you're gonna
make things right.

41:34.425 --> 41:37.038
- Yeah, uh, I'll go find them.

41:37.062 --> 41:38.339
- Yes.

41:38.363 --> 41:39.707
- Yeah with the storm coming in

41:39.731 --> 41:42.877
we're gonna need some
supplies anyways, right?

41:42.901 --> 41:45.837
- Yes, that's a great idea.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.340
- You know what
I'll go with him.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.181
- Dad hates the cold.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.217
He's probably out playing
hooky somewhere.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.372
- Nana, Papa!

42:22.140 --> 42:25.243
I don't know why they
would've traveled this far.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.756
- So you see things Nick?

42:28.780 --> 42:29.815
- Nana!

42:33.051 --> 42:34.452
- Hey man I get it.

42:35.754 --> 42:36.964
We've all been
through some shit,

42:36.988 --> 42:38.700
kind of changes your
perspective of things.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.267
- Yeah well it's a good
thing there are people

42:40.291 --> 42:42.570
I pay to talk about
those things.

42:42.594 --> 42:43.638
- I'm sorry.

42:43.662 --> 42:45.306
- Papa!

42:45.330 --> 42:46.608
- I guess Victoria
didn't tell you

42:46.632 --> 42:48.767
I'm an actual psychologist.

42:49.134 --> 42:50.401
- Nana!

42:53.271 --> 42:54.572
Papa!

42:55.306 --> 42:56.775
- But in your case...

42:58.509 --> 43:00.311
a god damn psychiatrist.

43:04.249 --> 43:09.520
See, Mr. Conway wanted me
to give you a message.

43:10.756 --> 43:13.668
It wasn't hard,
I've had you pegged

43:13.692 --> 43:16.494
ever since the first
time I laid eyes on you.

43:17.328 --> 43:19.030
I mean who knows?

43:19.330 --> 43:23.101
You might've been bullied,
you might've been touched.

43:24.002 --> 43:26.137
Could've been batshit crazy.

43:28.373 --> 43:32.543
But either way, you're
gonna tell Victoria

43:32.978 --> 43:34.255
that you can't do this.

43:34.279 --> 43:37.382
"Hey it's too much,
I'm too coo-coo."

43:42.387 --> 43:45.891
Believe me, she'll understand.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.660
- Okay.

44:03.709 --> 44:05.510
Pretty long walk.

44:08.847 --> 44:10.992
Someone could get lost.

46:27.285 --> 46:30.031
- I always knew you'd settle down
in a nice quiet little town.

46:30.055 --> 46:33.300
- Dad this was supposed
to be an introduction,

46:33.324 --> 46:36.470
a chance for us to all meet and
spend Christmas together...

46:36.494 --> 46:39.040
- What so we could meet the
guy you decided to marry

46:39.064 --> 46:41.342
without consulting us
or telling anyone?

46:41.366 --> 46:42.834
- Consulting?

46:43.234 --> 46:44.645
- You're cooped up in this house

46:44.669 --> 46:46.948
doing what you clearly
don't want to do.

46:46.972 --> 46:49.316
Do you have any interest
in this family whatsoever?

46:49.340 --> 46:51.009
- Family?

46:51.742 --> 46:55.013
That is rich coming from you.

47:00.651 --> 47:06.925
Tell me is this everyone or
are we waiting on someone?

47:07.392 --> 47:09.236
- That's enough.
- Come on, Dad.

47:09.260 --> 47:13.140
Let's all hear it, how's
our brother nowadays?

47:13.164 --> 47:15.766
Have you heard from him lately?

47:16.401 --> 47:17.644
- I said that's enough.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.881
- Oh why don't we
go and ask his mom?

47:19.905 --> 47:22.407
Remember the one you sent away?

47:29.280 --> 47:30.781
- John.
- I know honey.

47:31.716 --> 47:33.660
You're mad at me,

47:33.684 --> 47:36.521
and that's okay, I
probably deserve it,

47:37.055 --> 47:39.333
but that's no reason to
throw your life away.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.434
- I am not.

47:40.458 --> 47:43.905
- And what's sad is you
don't even see it.

47:43.929 --> 47:45.363
Look around you,

47:45.796 --> 47:48.409
there's no photos of a
life before this moment.

47:48.433 --> 47:49.567
- John.

47:49.901 --> 47:52.046
- No artwork, no paintings...
- John.

47:52.070 --> 47:54.639
- No plans, no memories...
- John.

47:54.906 --> 47:55.849
John!

47:55.873 --> 47:57.808
- Don't you find
that a little odd?

47:59.945 --> 48:01.288
He told you that he
killed his father

48:01.312 --> 48:03.248
when he was nine right?

48:07.385 --> 48:10.288
Or that he stabbed his mother in
the face over and over again?

48:10.821 --> 48:13.758
And now she's sitting in
a psych ward in Bristol.

48:14.425 --> 48:16.437
You know it's amazing
what you can find out

48:16.461 --> 48:18.229
if you do a little research.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.610
Christmas Eve Massacre,

48:23.634 --> 48:25.479
or that's what the
papers called it,

48:25.503 --> 48:28.950
house of murdered guests
donned in their finest silks.

48:28.974 --> 48:33.444
- Honey, we just didn't know
how to tell you all of this.

48:39.084 --> 48:45.290
- If I'm guilty, I'm guilty of
trying to protect my little girl.

48:47.959 --> 48:48.960
- Oh.

48:51.496 --> 48:55.100
- Guys, everybody.

48:56.701 --> 48:58.036
We...

48:59.170 --> 49:02.373
we are in danger.

49:07.512 --> 49:09.314
- Calm down, it's okay.

49:11.816 --> 49:15.453
- No wait, what, no listen.

49:18.223 --> 49:23.961
There's a killer out there,
and we have to leave now.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.998
- Nick, where's Jeremiah?

49:28.633 --> 49:29.834
- Oh yeah.

49:31.002 --> 49:35.506
We were walking and
then he attacked me.

49:40.011 --> 49:41.011
I..

49:41.412 --> 49:42.413
He...

49:43.214 --> 49:47.718
He was... he was
attacked by this...

49:48.253 --> 49:50.897
this little-this

49:50.921 --> 49:51.999
this little thing!

49:52.023 --> 49:53.067
This... Okay.

49:53.091 --> 49:54.201
- This elf thing!

49:54.225 --> 49:56.237
- Okay, all right, calm down.

49:56.261 --> 50:00.507
- Don't tell me to calm
down, are you listening?

50:00.531 --> 50:02.333
We have to go!

50:04.069 --> 50:08.839
- Hey, I'm sorry I didn't
notice, I'm sorry.

50:09.540 --> 50:14.488
- You remember, you remember
the imp, the little elf thing.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.847
- You mean this elf?

50:19.284 --> 50:21.619
- Yeah, but he was...

50:27.525 --> 50:29.527
- I know it's not easy, son.

50:32.463 --> 50:39.237
- Hey, hey listen I'm gonna
support you through this, okay?

50:39.804 --> 50:41.615
We're in this together,

50:41.639 --> 50:45.743
but right now I just need to make sure
that you don't hurt anybody else.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.417
- You...

50:53.651 --> 50:56.321
you told him to attack me.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.871
- You told him to attack me.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.207
Why would you do that?

51:06.231 --> 51:08.275
- Let's go upstairs
and get ready

51:08.299 --> 51:09.710
and as soon as the storm passes

51:09.734 --> 51:11.445
we're gonna get you the
help that you need.

51:11.469 --> 51:13.647
Nick, baby, upstairs.

51:13.671 --> 51:15.616
- We're all here for you, son.

51:15.640 --> 51:16.783
- Let's just go upstairs and...

51:16.807 --> 51:17.918
- We're all here for you.

51:17.942 --> 51:21.246
- Baby let's just go
upstairs, come on.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.658
- What about Jeremiah?

51:24.682 --> 51:26.917
Dad? - I'll go
look for Jeremiah.

51:28.186 --> 51:29.296
He probably just got lost

51:29.320 --> 51:30.431
following Nick
back to the house.

51:30.455 --> 51:32.523
Hon, can you give
me my coat please?

51:41.098 --> 51:43.968
That's probably Jeremiah now.

51:44.369 --> 51:47.148
Hon, if Nana and Papa
get here before me

51:47.172 --> 51:48.749
make sure they stay, okay?

51:48.773 --> 51:52.653
âª Sayeth Christ and say his name

51:52.677 --> 51:57.548
âª He's the light, the joy within

51:58.149 --> 52:03.188
âª Be the light, the joy within

52:03.721 --> 52:05.199
- What's going on?

52:05.223 --> 52:07.825
- Hey, excuse me.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.471
âª Let your...

52:10.495 --> 52:12.297
Excuse me!

52:13.998 --> 52:15.809
Well that's great and all,

52:15.833 --> 52:17.811
but, I need to go look
for my son-in-law,

52:17.835 --> 52:20.113
and I don't have time for this,
but thanks for the offer.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.372
- No wait.

52:23.374 --> 52:27.578
You see, we traveled a very
long distance to be here.

52:30.315 --> 52:32.293
And it would really
warm my heart

52:32.317 --> 52:35.820
if you let us sing
one more song.

52:36.421 --> 52:41.392
âª We wish you peace and joy

52:42.360 --> 52:43.804
- What?

52:43.828 --> 52:48.309
âª We wish you peace
and joy within

52:50.668 --> 52:53.070
âª We wish you peace

52:55.240 --> 52:56.983
Oh my god!

53:51.161 --> 53:52.797
- What's going on?

53:54.231 --> 53:56.000
- Rolling blackout?

53:58.803 --> 54:01.406
I guess caused by the storm.

54:17.422 --> 54:18.923
That's weird.

54:31.636 --> 54:34.581
- John, what happened?

54:34.605 --> 54:35.973
- I don't know.

54:37.875 --> 54:40.654
Everybody just calm down okay?

54:40.678 --> 54:43.023
- We need to call somebody.
- There's nobody to call,

54:43.047 --> 54:44.691
there's no service.

54:44.715 --> 54:49.162
Just calm down okay.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.299
- What was that?

55:29.259 --> 55:30.671
- What the hell?

55:30.695 --> 55:31.929
- What is it?

55:32.363 --> 55:35.376
- It's-it's nothing,
it's nobody.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.768
Tiffany let me see that light.

55:40.237 --> 55:43.384
Tiffany give me the damn light.

55:43.408 --> 55:44.751
- Dad.

55:44.775 --> 55:46.052
- I'm gonna go check
on the breaker box.

55:46.076 --> 55:48.413
Yell if the lights come on.

55:49.213 --> 55:50.915
Check on your sister.

55:52.783 --> 55:56.253
- Just be careful out there.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.387
- What is that?

56:32.256 --> 56:35.092
- It's what I've been
trying to show you.

56:36.427 --> 56:38.496
- Is this from the...

56:39.664 --> 56:41.298
that thing?

56:53.611 --> 56:58.483
- When I was young, they
used to tell me about him.

57:01.819 --> 57:04.321
My grandfather.

57:09.860 --> 57:14.264
The keeper of children's souls.

57:20.705 --> 57:24.775
The uh-townspeople they were...

57:26.110 --> 57:30.981
so afraid of him that
they created a curfew,

57:33.017 --> 57:41.017
and uh, anyone that was
caught after dawn was...

57:47.898 --> 57:50.701
The story goes that...

57:52.503 --> 57:58.118
a wild hunt was initiated
by supernatural creatures,

57:58.142 --> 58:01.712
led by an evil demagogue.

58:05.716 --> 58:09.730
And their main objective
is to take souls.

58:09.754 --> 58:11.722
Our souls.

58:16.393 --> 58:20.397
And bring them down into...

58:23.167 --> 58:26.904
the underworld... for sport.

58:33.077 --> 58:34.444
And if you...

58:36.280 --> 58:42.086
if you saw them,
they-you're cursed.

58:43.087 --> 58:46.023
Unless you bargained
to help them.

58:55.265 --> 58:57.434
- Help-help them how?

59:09.714 --> 59:11.081
What is that?

59:12.817 --> 59:14.785
- I found this...

59:16.587 --> 59:18.923
inside the box with the elf.

59:29.066 --> 59:31.135
- I don't understand.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.337
Why are-

59:35.773 --> 59:38.442
why are some of the
names scratched out?

59:40.911 --> 59:48.662
- I think my grandfather
decided to help them

59:48.686 --> 59:50.897
by sealing the souls
of little kids

59:50.921 --> 59:53.023
inside of a wooden box.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:02.843
And they gifted him
with something

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:04.534
that would help him do it.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.177
- Sweet Christmas.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.295
- Gah!

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.562
- Who is there?

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.118
Perfect.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:50.780
- What?

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.392
- Dad?

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.503
- John, what happened to you?

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.205
- Jeremiah...

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:42.242
he's-in the snow man.

01:06:42.266 --> 01:06:44.101
- Did you find him?

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.947
- John, what happened to you?

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.519
- John, what happened to you?

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.094
- Somebody...

01:07:13.097 --> 01:07:14.798
He knows.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.970
The thing, the elf, he...

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.583
- It's Mom.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:29.922
- Get away from the door.

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:36.453
- Tiffany!

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.801
- It won't lift.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:00.386
- It's stuck.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.011
- How do we get rid of it?

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:03.889
Nick, what do we do?

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.682
- I don't know, okay?

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.004
- Dad.

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:32.142
Stay with me, stay with me.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:44.720
Don't speak, don't speak
just save your energy, ok?

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.804
- We need more bandages or...

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.538
- Upstairs, I'll go get 'em.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:56.509
- No, don't you move.

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:59.169
You have already done enough.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.517
- Mrs. Conway.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:07.344
- Don't, don't move.

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:06.703
- Dad I just...

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.275
Dad.

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:19.416
Dad.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:21.417
Dad.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.921
Dad.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.957
Dad, stay with me.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.058
Dad.

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:41.841
- This bitch has not
answered any of my...

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:43.042
- Hi, can I take your order?

01:11:43.066 --> 01:11:44.200
- One second please.

01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:50.049
Come on V.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:51.317
- I'm waiting, can
I take your order?

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:54.411
- Bitch I said hold on, damn.

01:11:58.582 --> 01:11:59.816
- Who is this?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.228
- Um, this is Sky
and who is this?

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:04.388
- Sky?

01:12:05.589 --> 01:12:06.532
Um..

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:07.556
Listen...

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:11.871
there's a fucking
killer on the loose

01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:13.997
at the Brooks' residence.

01:12:15.599 --> 01:12:16.809
- Wait, what?

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.011
Okay, um...

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:20.746
what does he look like?

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.840
- One foot... about
one foot two inches.

01:12:25.409 --> 01:12:31.347
Sky, listen, don't let the son
of a bitch leave this house.

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:35.452
- Did she just... hello?

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.922
Killer on the loose?

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:43.292
Hello! Killer on the loose!

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:47.840
I knew that motherfucker...
Amityville Horror.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:48.898
What did I say?

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:37.080
- Where'd you go?

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.905
- Another name has
been etched off.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:39.543
- Let me see that.

01:14:44.347 --> 01:14:48.027
Was there anything else,
something with it?

01:14:48.051 --> 01:14:51.354
- I, no I don't think so.

01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:55.091
- It's a yes or it's a no.

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:57.393
- I...

01:14:57.894 --> 01:15:00.172
- It said something about
having the ability

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:05.177
to erase one of the names.

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:07.412
- What does that mean?

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:10.506
- I don't know... the...

01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:16.989
the photo book, the toy
maker list, the...

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:18.347
- What about them?

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:23.262
- If this is a naughty list

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:28.333
and it is compiled for all
the names that were chosen

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:34.063
for a wild hunt, shit.

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:37.033
- What?

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:42.347
- The reason the, the reason
why the toy maker's ledger

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:46.576
is empty is because
he never finished.

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:51.414
All the people in Blakeley,

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:56.452
they're the children
of the town.

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:00.323
- Wait.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.259
You think...

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.971
You think that this
wild hunt is here

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:08.264
to finish off the townspeople?

01:16:08.832 --> 01:16:13.169
- No, their... descendants.

01:16:13.469 --> 01:16:15.471
To finish the cycle.

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:26.950
Their minds got old...

01:16:28.852 --> 01:16:34.299
No, their minds never changed,
but their bodies got old.

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:39.095
That is why the old man in
the car was acting so weird.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:44.033
- Okay what,

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:46.202
what,

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:50.339
if what you're saying
is true then...

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:55.344
your grandfather must not have
finished the list, which,

01:16:55.679 --> 01:16:57.280
that means that...

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.616
You're next.

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:13.997
- And if we don't... finish,

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.801
- Then the hunt continues.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.636
Unless...

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.647
There's two names here.

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:34.884
Oh shit, Mom.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.467
Mom?

01:17:46.029 --> 01:17:47.063
Mom?

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:32.942
What is that?

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:36.579
Mom?

01:18:39.482 --> 01:18:40.750
Nick.

01:18:52.295 --> 01:18:53.295
Nick.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:05.473
Nick.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.787
Are you seeing this, Nick?

01:19:19.022 --> 01:19:20.089
Nick.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.826
Nick.

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:26.262
- Hey, hey.

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:39.342
Nick.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.630
Let's get out of here.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:33.829
We have to go.

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:16.916
Get away!

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:41.206
What do you want from me?

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:40.356
Somebody help me!

01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:47.396
Nick!

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:06.749
Nick?

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:09.885
Nick?

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:53.072
- Kill it!

01:23:53.096 --> 01:23:57.008
Kill that motherfucking
piece of shit, kill it!

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.273
It's dead.

01:24:05.908 --> 01:24:07.610
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:13.416
- Come on.

01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:15.551
Come on.

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:16.961
Come on.

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:17.986
Come on.

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.032
- Walk. Walk.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:24.127
- Is it dead, is it dead?

01:24:34.837 --> 01:24:37.473
Nick, what the fuck?

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:50.262
I can't open it, I just
need a bit more...

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:51.454
Nick help me.

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:06.535
Just a little bit
more, I'm gonna...

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:16.345
- What's that? That emblem?

01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:21.617
- What do you mean, honey?

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:29.225
- How did your parents know
how to find this place?

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:43.172
- Because you aren't the only
one who survived this curse.

01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:45.784
Nothing personal my love,

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:48.977
it's just only one
name can be erased.

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.490
Hey! Listen!

01:25:51.514 --> 01:25:52.848
Where's the list?

01:25:53.749 --> 01:25:55.918
Stay with me, where's the list?

01:25:56.552 --> 01:25:58.663
Baby, baby.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.426
Do you think this is funny?

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:07.095
- Sort of.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.144
- No! No!

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:50.273
Baby!

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:51.974
Baby.

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:55.644
Don't, no.

01:27:07.456 --> 01:27:08.657
Merry Christmas.

01:27:48.331 --> 01:27:52.277
- These damn roads, they had
me circling round and round

01:27:52.301 --> 01:27:57.773
for like hours and then out of
nowhere it just cleared up.

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:04.523
I got you something,
it's a little cheap,

01:28:04.547 --> 01:28:07.383
but I knew it was
something you would like.

01:28:10.052 --> 01:28:11.954
Kind of weird, huh?

01:28:12.455 --> 01:28:15.290
It's a little creepy but...

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:18.461
Merry Christmas.
