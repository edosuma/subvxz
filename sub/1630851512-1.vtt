Macon, slow down, slow down.
Wait. Okay, which one is she?

You met her a hundred times. A-hole.

No, no, fuck that. You'd have to pay me.

01:33.708 --> 01:36.083
[Macon] What? Pay you?
She's throwing herself at you!

01:36.166 --> 01:38.291
No, I'm serious.
Not even for, like, a million--

[Macon] We really can't all be
flat-chested and pissed off like Hailey.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.375

lower your standards once in a while.

-Dude, I don't pregame that way.

02:23.833 --> 02:26.583
[Macon] Relax!
Why are you so serious right now?

02:26.666 --> 02:28.958
'Cause it's like pure protein.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.416
Why would I want good protein
out of my body before--

02:31.500 --> 02:34.000
[Macon] All right, but do not oversleep.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.708
Yeah, I'll be there.
Kickoff's in like four hours.

02:36.791 --> 02:39.041

Doesn't mean he had to die.

[girl 1]
That was way more than hazing, though.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.916
-[girl 5] It was brutal.
-[girl 6] He targeted Caleb.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.458
[girl 1] Is it 'cause Caleb's gay?

08:25.541 --> 08:27.500
[boy 3] Probably jealous
Caleb's the better player.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.333

08:29.416 --> 08:30.875

08:30.958 --> 08:32.666
[boy 2] The whole team was there.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.416

-[boy 2] He was in the game.

[girl 12] Who knows?

08:48.916 --> 08:52.333
-[girl 13] I'm honestly scared.
-[boy 5] What do we do? Go back to school?

08:52.416 --> 08:54.833
-[girl 14] I can't sleep.
-[boy 5] I can't live here anymore.

08:54.916 --> 08:57.250
-[girl 15] The sheriff have a suspect?
-[boy 5] He won't say.

Did I say anything? I think it's great,
really. I love that optimism.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.875
At least she got him something.

09:46.958 --> 09:48.375
Sorry I don't know what to get a guy

09:48.458 --> 09:50.458
who beat the shit out of me
for fun for three years.

09:50.541 --> 09:51.416

-Wow.

09:59.291 --> 10:00.791
Oh, that's actually pretty smart.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.416
Am I crazy, or are people
side-eyeing me right now?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.541

[Macon] One time
we were having pizza, right?

11:07.791 --> 11:10.875
And I was telling him
I was having trouble finding Stacy's clit.

11:11.375 --> 11:12.875
Jackson goes with the pizza box,

11:12.958 --> 11:15.666
makes a diagram with pizza sauce
to show me where it was on her body.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.958
Think about it.

11:38.041 --> 11:40.500
No way Jackson's parents
wanna live in that house

11:40.583 --> 11:43.333
on that farm
where their… where their kid was killed

11:43.416 --> 11:45.166
any longer than they have to, right?

11:45.250 --> 11:47.833
Who else wants that farm
more than Skipper Sandford,

11:47.916 --> 11:49.958
the land baron of Osborne?

Uh.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.125
Sorry. Thanks.

12:08.708 --> 12:09.541
I'm Darby.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.916
I know. I'm Caleb.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.541
A pleasure to meet y'all,
I guess, officially.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.083
Caleb.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.166
It's not a country club, Caleb.

12:20.708 --> 12:21.541
I'm Makani.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.208
That's Rodrigo,

12:24.291 --> 12:25.458
Zach,

12:25.541 --> 12:27.500
and Alex. She's our bitch-in-residence.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.625
-Oh! Thank you.
-[Makani] Mm-hmm.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.708
-[girl 2] My fellow seniors.
-You think I'm bad?

12:32.291 --> 12:34.458
[girl 2] If may have
your attention, please.

12:34.958 --> 12:36.208
Thank you.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.333
I mean, what can one say
in the wake of such sadness?

12:39.833 --> 12:41.458
Yet as your student council president,

12:41.541 --> 12:44.041
I feel it's imperative
that I provide a beacon,

12:44.125 --> 12:48.041
a kind of guiding light
in these dark and trying times.

12:49.083 --> 12:53.000
So, I'd like to read an excerpt
from my admission essay to Cornell.

12:53.625 --> 12:54.583
It's about oppression.

12:55.166 --> 12:59.000
Princess Diana of Wales once said,
in her infinite wisdom,

12:59.083 --> 13:02.958
that, "The greatest problem
in the world today is intolerance."

13:03.541 --> 13:06.458
Did bitch just quote a princess
instead of someone actually oppressed?

13:06.541 --> 13:09.208
We have a student here at my school

13:09.291 --> 13:11.875
who is an outer space enthusiast,

13:11.958 --> 13:14.416
but that's not the only thing
about this student that's alien.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.250
His name, or her name,

13:17.333 --> 13:19.583
depending on the day, is Darby.

13:20.208 --> 13:24.416
Born Justine Darby, this student
showed me the meaning of courage

13:24.500 --> 13:28.041
when, at age 11, she came out
to our school as she, he, and they,

13:28.125 --> 13:30.083
and now every day in my mind,

13:30.166 --> 13:33.250
I applaud her, him, and them.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.875
[all applauding]

13:36.708 --> 13:38.125
[mouthing]

13:38.208 --> 13:42.291
[girl 2] Jackson's video
and his death were hateful,

13:42.375 --> 13:44.208
and the only way to respond to hate…

13:46.208 --> 13:47.041
is with love.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.583
We love all versions of you, Darby, okay?

13:50.666 --> 13:52.500
Like we love all versions of Caleb.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.958
So please, guys,

13:55.041 --> 13:58.500
let's celebrate that love tomorrow
at the memorial at Holy Trinity.

13:58.583 --> 14:01.500

27:47.791 --> 27:48.833
I don't know.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.791
Makes my head hurt.
Doesn't make sense, you know?

27:51.875 --> 27:53.916
Like, why would the killer go after Katie?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.833
Because Katie
and Jackson both had secrets.

-Look at his face.

28:02.291 --> 28:05.125

He's not making any eye contact.

to hate football as it is to play it?

-[Alex] They're the worst to you.

-Hello?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.708
There's a referendum
on the ballot next month

28:40.791 --> 28:42.125
to dissolve the Police Department.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.875
-That's legal?
-Replace it with private security.

28:44.958 --> 28:47.958
But not if he solves a series of murders,

28:48.041 --> 28:51.333
and by that, I mean blaming it
on someone who's not white

28:51.416 --> 28:52.875
and becoming a local hero.

28:52.958 --> 28:54.166

32:07.291 --> 32:10.916
I think you like being around
someone more fucked up than you.

32:12.166 --> 32:16.958
Because it made you feel normal,
but then summer was over, school started.

32:17.041 --> 32:19.416
You had to go back
to pretending you are normal,

32:19.500 --> 32:21.208
which you're not.

32:22.083 --> 32:23.500
That's a compliment.

endangered that image.

-I mean, I never said that.

57:08.500 --> 57:11.500
Maybe that's why I brought you
out here in the first place, you know?

57:13.416 --> 57:15.166
Where no one can find us.

57:17.208 --> 57:19.625
Well, you'd have to know my secret first.

57:19.708 --> 57:20.833
You think I don't?

57:55.083 --> 57:57.708
[whispering] I actually
think you love secrets.

57:59.375 --> 58:02.000
You still won't tell
a single soul about me.

and keep calling, so I'm, uh…

-Yeah.
-Yeah. Sorry.

Hi. What do you want?

58:30.833 --> 58:31.875
Not far.

58:33.041 --> 58:33.916
Yes.

where I am all the time.

-[sighs]
-Did you tell him?

58:54.875 --> 58:55.791
No.

58:56.916 --> 58:59.000
Still thinks he can be my dad, you know?

59:05.041 --> 59:06.708
You never talk about them,

59:08.208 --> 59:09.208

59:10.916 --> 59:12.000
What happened?

59:17.166 --> 59:18.208
Sorry.

59:18.958 --> 59:21.625
We can… we can just go. [clears throat]

59:23.583 --> 59:25.250
They crashed into a tree.

59:29.333 --> 59:30.916
My dad was driving.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.916
It killed him instantly, and, um,

59:35.750 --> 59:40.250
my mom, she, um…
she died in the hospital the next day.

59:42.166 --> 59:44.333
I mean, they were drunks, you know?

59:44.416 --> 59:49.666
Always were, but that part gets,
like, left out conveniently.

59:50.500 --> 59:53.833
But it makes for a better legend,
I guess, when it's some

59:54.666 --> 59:59.166
dramatic double suicide
'cause a kid had behavioral issues.

1:00:02.583 --> 1:00:05.500
You know, I just think, like,
when something really terrible happens,

1:00:05.583 --> 1:00:08.583
people need someone to blame.

1:00:09.958 --> 1:00:12.166
No one probably gets that better than you.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.041

What?

Being blamed.

Did you do a background check on me?

And he's a murderer.

1:10:04.625 --> 1:10:07.750

the chance to show he's decent.

What's wrong?

The Art of War on my ninth birthday?

1:20:51.791 --> 1:20:55.333
and… and aware of his life choices
and consequences and--

what that word means anymore?

zero emotional investment in the outcome!

And… and not to mention
extremely work-intensive.

to make these fucking masks?

Look, this… this isn't you!

I've spent my whole life denying who I am.

1:21:40.208 --> 1:21:43.791
I was ashamed, but why?
Because I was born with privilege?

1:21:43.875 --> 1:21:45.958
Why should I feel bad about that?

1:21:46.708 --> 1:21:49.458
It's not my fault. It's what I was given.

1:21:50.458 --> 1:21:55.166
Do you see now?
You're all wearing masks, Makani Sun-woo.

1:21:55.791 --> 1:21:59.166
You're all putting on
these… these fake faces.

1:21:59.833 --> 1:22:03.208
You're all hypocrites! Just like my dad.

1:22:03.291 --> 1:22:07.458
But I… I can't hide
from my dad's last name.

1:22:08.041 --> 1:22:12.500
So I… I'm… I'm showing
these people who they are!

1:22:12.583 --> 1:22:14.041
Who they really are!

1:22:15.666 --> 1:22:18.500
Take one more fucking step,
and I swear to God, I will--

1:22:18.583 --> 1:22:19.916
What? What?

1:22:20.500 --> 1:22:22.208
You'll push me into the fire?

1:22:22.916 --> 1:22:26.875
Stab me with the same knife you used
on Caleb? On Jackson and Katie?

1:22:27.416 --> 1:22:30.083
The same knife you used
to slit Rodrigo's throat?

1:22:31.083 --> 1:22:33.000
You killed my dad.

1:22:33.083 --> 1:22:34.916
You killed Ollie.

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:37.791
That's why I had to protect myself

by killing you.

1:22:40.291 --> 1:22:42.166

and they find you dead.
