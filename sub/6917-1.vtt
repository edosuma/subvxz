- Merry Christmas.
- I'm not here.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.478
-Mr. Murray's suite.
-I'm already dead.

03:21.561 --> 03:23.813
- Yes, of course.
- The answer's no.

03:26.065 --> 03:28.109
-Who is it?
-Your producers, Mr. Murray.

03:28.193 --> 03:31.363
They're outside.
They've heard your beautiful voice, sir.

03:31.446 --> 03:34.407
- God hates me.
- Forgive me, Mr. Murray.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.702
But God is your biggest fan.
Number one fan.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.121
Truly a huge fan, Mr. Murray.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.624
-You really think so?
-Number one, sir. Number one.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.460
- Hey!
- Hey!

03:45.668 --> 03:47.546
Murray Christmas!

03:47.628 --> 03:48.838
-Get it?
-Yeah...

03:48.921 --> 03:52.884
-Wow, you look festive.
-I would lose those antlers.

03:54.219 --> 03:56.929
Has anyone shown up for this thing?

03:57.597 --> 03:59.640
-We're here.
-Yeah, so that's one friend.

03:59.724 --> 04:01.601
- Paul's here.
- Yeah, Paul's here.

04:01.684 --> 04:03.728
I wouldn't miss this nutty gig
for the world.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.689
What are you worried about?
Come on. Let's do the show.

04:06.772 --> 04:09.150
-Chop, chop.
-There's no one moving in the whole city.

04:09.234 --> 04:11.403
The airports are closed.
The trains are closed.

04:11.486 --> 04:14.655
The buses and bridges and tunnels
are not working.

04:15.448 --> 04:19.952
A couple of saloons have closed.
The entire city of New York is shut down.

04:20.745 --> 04:23.540
And you're expecting me to go downstairs
and do a show?

04:23.748 --> 04:27.710
-Anything that's fun is always hard.
-That's right.

04:27.919 --> 04:32.215
Oh, it's a miracle.
You two are going to shut up for a second.

04:33.383 --> 04:35.427
- Please be George.
- Please be George.

04:35.510 --> 04:37.095
- Hey.
- Is it George Clooney?

04:37.178 --> 04:38.638
-Is it Clooney?
-Is it Clooney?

04:38.721 --> 04:41.057
-Is he on the phone?
-Please, God, let it be Clooney.

04:41.140 --> 04:42.683
How did you get this number?

04:43.893 --> 04:47.772
Now, you'd better tell me because
I'm going to find out. I am working.

04:49.441 --> 04:52.360
Don't ever do this again.
Ever. You got it?

04:57.532 --> 05:00.285
-My sister.
-Family is important.

05:00.493 --> 05:02.412
I need you to produce!

05:02.495 --> 05:03.871
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.999
-How do we cancel this?
-Okay. I understand why you're frustrated.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.628
I would be frustrated, too.
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.130
-Bev, should we cancel it?
-Okay. You two, grow up.

05:12.213 --> 05:14.799
The satellite is bought and paid for
and non-refundable.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.176
-So we can't cancel.
-You've got to try to cancel.

05:17.260 --> 05:19.845
-We placed all the ads, man.
-Which is so exciting!

05:19.929 --> 05:23.642
-The network has been pro-mo'ing this.
-They are very jazzed about it.

05:23.724 --> 05:27.186
And I don't want to tell you how
personally on the hook you are for this.

05:27.270 --> 05:29.147
You do not want to get sued, Bill.

05:29.355 --> 05:31.941
You don't want to be personally
on the hook. That is scary.

05:32.024 --> 05:33.526
So we've got some weather issues.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.446
Hold on, Bev.
Bill might have a right. Maybe--

05:36.529 --> 05:40.575
Bill has a contractual right to do the
best fucking Christmas show that he can.

05:40.659 --> 05:42.994
Let me guess. You're the bad cop.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.246
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was a little over the top.

05:45.330 --> 05:46.456
Hey.

05:47.832 --> 05:49.959
-Think of the troops.
-Yeah.

05:50.042 --> 05:55.131
Right? And the kids in hospitals.
And pets outside.

05:55.340 --> 05:56.633
I need my antlers!

05:56.716 --> 05:58.426
You always forget them.

05:58.510 --> 06:01.012
-Jackpot! Here we go.
-Thanks, Paul. Come on.

06:01.638 --> 06:03.055
Here we go. Here we go.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.684
No, no, no, no. No elevator.

06:05.766 --> 06:09.145
The little guys in uniforms who run
these things couldn't make it in today.

06:09.228 --> 06:12.607
Yeah, we're walking. A little exercise
is not going to kill you.

06:13.274 --> 06:16.611
-Come on.
-Goodness me. Dimitri, hold onto these.

06:16.695 --> 06:20.031
♪ Oh, the weather outside is frightful ♪

06:20.114 --> 06:23.284
♪ But the fire is so delightful ♪

06:23.493 --> 06:26.287
♪ And since we've no place to go ♪

06:26.496 --> 06:30.291
♪ Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow ♪

06:30.375 --> 06:32.544
♪ Let it snow-- ♪

06:32.627 --> 06:36.548
This is your idea of a Christmas
special? This is a national disgrace.

06:38.174 --> 06:41.802
Alright, stand down, Double D.
He's just a Hollywood sleaze bag.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.765
I don't even know how to express
my shame in this moment.

06:45.848 --> 06:49.018
The Murricane
skulking down the back stairs

06:49.101 --> 06:52.104
like some 25-dollar-an-hour
Twin Cities hooker.

06:52.313 --> 06:57.443
Go away. I told you.
I don't want a manager, especially you.

06:57.652 --> 06:59.945
Maybe not. But you definitely need one.

07:00.029 --> 07:06.160
Bill, Billy, this sad excuse for
a Christmas special-- No harm intended...

07:06.244 --> 07:07.495
Oh, none taken.

07:07.579 --> 07:10.248
Seems more like a Christ-mess,
as in, what a mess!

07:12.709 --> 07:14.419
We have George Clooney.

07:15.253 --> 07:16.962
I rest my case.

07:17.046 --> 07:18.214
You saw Monuments Men?

07:18.423 --> 07:21.217
-I was in it.
-Number what? Seven on the call sheet?

07:21.300 --> 07:23.135
-You were so good in that.
-You were great.

07:23.219 --> 07:24.262
You were very good.

07:24.470 --> 07:27.265
What I'm saying
is we all love George, right?

07:27.348 --> 07:29.434
He and I are close.
He's a citizen of the world.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.728
But we need size. We need edge.

07:31.936 --> 07:35.940
If security had come in today,
I would be calling them right now.

07:36.148 --> 07:39.902
Look, just sign with me today, okay?
I know you're a big fish.

07:39.985 --> 07:42.863
But you're not going to snap my line,
okay? I'm hanging on tight.

07:42.947 --> 07:44.824
Here's our Murricane special.

07:44.907 --> 07:47.493
Blimp shot down
into Dallas Cowboys Stadium--

07:47.702 --> 07:49.454
-Done it.
-Retractable roof opens.

07:49.537 --> 07:52.957
-80,000 screaming fans.
-Yeah.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.917
What? You do it in post.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.001
Camera zooms in.

07:56.085 --> 08:00.423
We see Miley Cyrus wearing a sexy
red mini skirt, sitting on a white sleigh.

08:00.506 --> 08:02.133
-You run in--
-Miley's in Tahoe.

08:03.301 --> 08:07.888
I know Miley.
And that may or may not be true.

08:08.097 --> 08:10.266
Okay, you just have to go away. I'm sorry.

08:10.349 --> 08:14.562
Please just go as far away
as your company will send you.

08:14.646 --> 08:17.440
Miss, could you check him, please?
Thank you.

08:17.523 --> 08:20.067
I've heard that one.
You better check yourself, Bill.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.779
You better run like a thief
from this car wreck.

08:23.529 --> 08:25.114
Total disaster.

08:26.699 --> 08:28.493
Total disaster.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.162
Are you an actress?

08:36.501 --> 08:40.296
Tonight, Christmas Eve, from
the legendary Hotel Carlyle in New York,

08:40.379 --> 08:42.548
Bill Murray
and his celebrity friends gather--

08:42.756 --> 08:44.383
See, Bill? Easy peasy.

08:44.467 --> 08:49.681
We cut from you here live on stage,
to your guests' pre-taped reaction shots.

08:49.764 --> 08:52.517
No one knows you aren't
in the same room together. Boom, done.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.227
-A Christmas miracle.
-You've got to be kidding.

08:56.896 --> 09:00.483
This is from last year's Golden Globes.
That's not going to match.

09:00.692 --> 09:03.778
Yeah, match it...
What does it have to match?

09:03.862 --> 09:06.280
It's all just fantasy, right?

09:06.364 --> 09:09.868
I mean, we're the weavers of dreams.
We're the makers of merry.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.245
-This is all just an illusion.
-Absolutely. It's all an illusion, Bill.

09:13.329 --> 09:16.290
That's Brad Pitt and Angelina.
They're in Africa.

09:16.374 --> 09:17.834
And it's daytime in Africa.

09:17.917 --> 09:21.170
They're not in New York at Bemelmans.
They're in Africa.

09:21.253 --> 09:22.922
Those are huts.

09:23.005 --> 09:24.131
Who sees a hut?

09:24.215 --> 09:27.510
Come on. Bill, calm down and trust us.

09:27.593 --> 09:30.555
Were you nominated for an Emmy
for producing the SAG awards?

09:30.763 --> 09:32.223
- No.
- Neither were we.

09:32.891 --> 09:35.976
So get up there and do the show.
We go live in 90 seconds.

09:36.185 --> 09:40.606
Bill, I think it's a blessing
that these people didn't show up.

09:40.690 --> 09:43.693
Because now it's your time, you know.

09:43.902 --> 09:46.987
The universe gives us many gifts.
It's whether or not we receive them.

09:47.071 --> 09:50.157
-That's right. Receive the gift.
-This job is always surprising me.

09:50.783 --> 09:53.786
-I'm so alone.
-Okay, Bill...

09:53.870 --> 09:55.329
-You know--
-We're with you...

09:55.413 --> 09:56.622
You know, you and I...

09:57.707 --> 09:59.417
we're not in the same business.

10:04.630 --> 10:06.173
Okay, there he goes. He's going.

10:06.257 --> 10:09.260
Bill, I don't want to pressure you,
but one minute until air.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.096
Five cameras. I like our chances
of someone getting it right.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.433
60 seconds! He's going up.
Let's get ready. Are you ready, Paul?

10:16.308 --> 10:18.310
- Ready!
- Alright.

10:18.394 --> 10:21.439
- What are we doing?
- Let's jingle those bells, buddy.

10:21.522 --> 10:24.066
We're going live
in five seconds, everyone.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.444
Is there a microphone
or do we imagine that, too?

10:26.652 --> 10:28.738
- Use your stage voice.
- Yeah.

10:28.821 --> 10:29.906
You're on stage.

10:30.114 --> 10:31.741
There we go. Look.

10:32.408 --> 10:35.954
- We've got one sound guy.
- Swing the camera. The other way.

10:38.247 --> 10:39.874
You people are disgusting.

10:39.958 --> 10:42.084
-You're looking great up there.
-Crushing it.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.921
We're going live on air. Stand by.

10:45.004 --> 10:47.256
Everyone set? We're live on TV in...

10:47.465 --> 10:54.054
eight, seven, six, five, four, three...

10:54.138 --> 10:55.890
Make it great. Two... Go, Bill!

11:00.269 --> 11:05.232

I can't do this. I'm sorry, Ivan.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.832
- I can't do this.
- Cut the tape!

11:20.915 --> 11:25.586
I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be laughing.
I want to weep, okay?

11:25.795 --> 11:27.964
Go to commercial.

11:28.047 --> 11:30.800
I am weeping. I am weeping.

11:30.883 --> 11:34.136
I've never wept on a stage.
This is a first.

11:34.219 --> 11:36.430
I just can't do this. I'm sorry.

11:36.514 --> 11:40.434
We've got to... I don't know.
Show an old football game or something.

11:40.518 --> 11:42.144
I just can't do this.

11:42.812 --> 11:44.146
Total disaster.

11:44.939 --> 11:47.900
I've got to run. I've got to hide.

11:47.984 --> 11:51.236
Oh, it's freezing out there.
Oh, God...

11:51.445 --> 11:52.947
Oh, it's cold!

11:55.658 --> 11:57.409
I should have quit right then and there.

11:57.493 --> 11:59.871
I should have stopped
right then and there.

11:59.954 --> 12:02.373

12:07.169 --> 12:09.881
-Bill Murray!
-Chris Rock!

12:09.964 --> 12:12.758
Chris! Chris!

12:12.842 --> 12:16.012
Bill, what are you doing here
in the biggest blizzard in the world, man?

12:16.220 --> 12:18.222
-Don't leave. Don't leave.
-I'm not--

12:18.305 --> 12:20.641
Don't leave. Stay, Chris. Stay.

12:20.725 --> 12:23.310
Go around. You can't go that way.

12:23.394 --> 12:26.856
-Counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise.
-Counter-clockwise!

12:26.939 --> 12:28.357
The other way.

12:28.440 --> 12:33.905
- Counter-clockwise. You are such a pro!
- It's a pleasure.

12:33.988 --> 12:37.449
Counter-clockwise. Chris!

12:38.659 --> 12:40.078
What's up, man?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.620
How did you get uptown?

12:41.704 --> 12:43.831
-Subway.
-They shut down the subway.

12:43.915 --> 12:47.126
They are. They are.
I had to walk on the rails, man.

12:47.793 --> 12:51.338
-Sit down with me, buddy.
-I'm sitting down, man.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.215
What's going on?
What's all this stuff?

12:53.298 --> 12:55.509
Well, I'm supposed to be doing
a live TV show.

12:55.593 --> 12:57.136
-Okay.
-Live Christmas special.

12:57.219 --> 12:58.721
-Are you in it?
-It just started.

12:58.804 --> 13:01.223
-I'm the only one.
-Oh, man.

13:01.306 --> 13:05.144
You're doing a live special in the middle
of the biggest blizzard of the year.

13:05.227 --> 13:07.688
That is so you, Bill. That is so you.

13:07.897 --> 13:09.314
-But now you're here.
-Yeah.

13:09.398 --> 13:11.233
-And it's us.
-No!

13:11.316 --> 13:12.985
-Yeah!
-No!

13:13.193 --> 13:17.156
-Dust off the pipes a little bit. Sing a--
-I don't sing, Bill.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.658
-You sing. You're a rapper.
-I don't rap.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.702
Do you know me?

13:21.786 --> 13:23.037
Some...

13:23.955 --> 13:25.998
You can do it, Chris.
You've got to help me.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.333
You can be the guy that saved Christmas.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.544
I don't want to--
I can save your Christmas.

13:30.628 --> 13:33.714
But what about mine? I've got
to get out of here. I've got stuff to do.

13:33.798 --> 13:35.382
I've got to get home and build stuff.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.593
I've got to build
a Malibu Barbie Beach House.

13:37.802 --> 13:40.054
-You can't leave. You're trapped here.
-Bill.

13:40.138 --> 13:41.680
-No way you get out of here.
-Bill.

13:41.764 --> 13:44.850
Now, look. All you've got to do
is come in, sing a couple of songs.

13:44.934 --> 13:48.104
Dance a little bit, you know.
We'll put you in some cool clothes.

13:48.187 --> 13:52.566
And I swear on my life I will get you
on the first snowmobile in the morning.

13:52.775 --> 13:54.318
Bill, I barely know you, okay?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.112
-I just met you--
-This is our chance!

13:56.195 --> 13:58.572
-Where's your boys?
-Let's hang! We've got to hang!

13:58.656 --> 14:03.452
Where's George Clooney?
Matt Damon or John Goodman? Your boys!

14:03.535 --> 14:04.745
Why am I here?

14:04.954 --> 14:07.915
Maybe you should postpone this.
Do it a little later.

14:07.999 --> 14:09.708
Is there any way?

14:09.792 --> 14:11.002
No.

14:11.085 --> 14:12.252
I've got to go, Bill.

14:12.336 --> 14:17.800
