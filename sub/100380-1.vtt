00:59.360 --> 01:01.360
I'm sorry.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.562
Would you mind if I had a drink?

01:06.567 --> 01:10.502
This is a very unusual
and very...

01:12.640 --> 01:14.506
disturbing case.

01:20.448 --> 01:23.849
Now, we need to break into
your thought patterns.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.217
Hmm.

01:25.219 --> 01:28.187
Stop the symptoms
before they appear.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.424
You seem to have been
having dreams.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.794
Anxiety dreams.

01:35.796 --> 01:39.465
Not normal in the circumstances.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.301
Though there's nothing
particularly normal

01:42.303 --> 01:44.369
about these circumstances.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.475
This... is where
your thoughts are.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.443
Yes?

01:52.279 --> 01:55.614
And you are able
to describe this

01:55.616 --> 01:58.617
in more detail and accuracy
than your own bedroom.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.191
Please tell me everything.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.529
From the beginning.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.398
You're amazing.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.839
Oh, don't smoke.
They'll know we've used the room.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.742
- It's fine.
- It's not, with your concierge friend

04:36.744 --> 04:39.745
losing his job over our hookups.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.986
You're not hungry?

04:47.988 --> 04:50.555
- No, you have it.
- Raw fish.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.691
That's for you. You like sushi.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.660
We better tidy up
and get back to the bank.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.729
At bank, we get some sushi.
We can't be late today.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.564
- I've gotta leave early.
- Why?

05:02.469 --> 05:03.802
We can't keep doing this.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.905
I know.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.640
It's doing my head in, too.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.776
I keep having to buy George
Manchester season tickets.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.446
This isn't a joke.
Not for me, anyway.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.848
All right, I'm sorry. Hmm?

05:16.850 --> 05:19.484
I know I'm not sensible
as boring Ben.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.886
But we're good together, huh?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.590
Yeah.

05:25.592 --> 05:28.527
With a hour a week we get
to spend with each other.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.063
Leave Ben, and we can start
seeing each other properly.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.831
And maybe
we can even live together.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.001
Where? Your entire flat
is smaller than this bedroom.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.370
Or we can get
a bigger place together.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.739
With what? You've been
in that job seven years,

05:40.741 --> 05:43.875
- and you're still broke.
- Well, you're earning all right.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.015
I can't just leave him, Rob.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.884
We need a plan.
Thought for the future.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.520
What future?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.656
Exactly.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.934
Why're you leaving early today?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.904
We're going to a wedding,

06:12.906 --> 06:14.473
in Dorset.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.943
I do hope the weather
holds out for you.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.678
Rob...

06:22.883 --> 06:24.816
You've got a sweetheart,
you know?

06:35.162 --> 06:36.895
I'll see you at work.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.112
Bro, where've you been?
I thought we were doing lunch.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.047
Look, don't, all right?
I just got dumped.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.883
It's always something, isn't it?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.520
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.688
Meet me here for dinner
after work, all right?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.524
Okay.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.075
Well, Ms. Gueller,
thank you so much.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.510
And if you'd like
to follow me...

07:30.984 --> 07:32.584
Another migraine, eh?

07:33.554 --> 07:34.886
Sarah not back from lunch?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.054
Not yet.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.424
Any calls?

07:39.425 --> 07:41.225
Yeah, Sharon from HR. She asked
if you could give her a call back.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.628
Wonder what I've done this time?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.564
- Robert.
- Hi.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.967
This young lady would like to
set up a safe deposit box.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.636
It's in the amount
of £50,000 cash.

07:51.638 --> 07:55.507
It's already been counted. She set
up the account, there's the number.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.676
Um, still waiting
for approval on this.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.644
So, let's give it off the
register for the time being.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.480
- Certainly, Ben.
- Ms. Gueller,

08:01.482 --> 08:03.682
- it's been a pleasure. All the best.
- Thank you very much.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.585
Hey. Thank you.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.887
It's a lot of cash
to be carrying around.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.755
What do I know, huh?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.023
You're a sight for sore eyes.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.659
- How are you?
- Great.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.496
Um, lemme just go
and get your receipt, okay?

08:25.906 --> 08:28.039
Uh, yeah, so we'll look
after the cash for you

08:28.041 --> 08:29.541
once all the verifications,
you know,

08:29.543 --> 08:31.176
ID, address have all been
approved, okay?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.943
Um, we'll be in contact
with you on Monday.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.645
- Okay, great. Thanks, bye.
- All right.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.668
- Robert.
- Yes.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.837
I'm leaving early today,
so if you wouldn't mind

08:58.839 --> 09:00.805
locking up the shop,
that'd be great.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.774
- Yeah, no problem.
- All right, have a good weekend.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.143
- Yeah, you too, Ben.
- Don't be long.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.052
I'm sorry about earlier.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.555
It's just... I think
you could be brilliant

09:16.557 --> 09:18.790
if you put your mind to it.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.825
- Um, Sarah...
- Let me finish.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.863
If things were different,

09:24.865 --> 09:27.065
if your situation
were different,

09:27.067 --> 09:28.767
then, maybe we...

09:29.736 --> 09:30.969
I have to go.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.322
Um, Patricia,

09:50.324 --> 09:54.092
would you, um, mind
putting away these

09:54.094 --> 09:55.660
I've just gotta go
and pack my stuff up.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.863
Please. Thanks.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.841
What're you doing?

10:43.744 --> 10:46.111
Um, I was just, uh, locking up.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.813
Have you got your stuff?
We can go.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.083
Okay, yeah. I'll just get it.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.798
You all right, Patricia?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.400
Yeah, Trish, you know,

11:08.402 --> 11:10.201
it's a bit late to get the tube.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.138
Why don't you jump on a taxi?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.373
- See you on Monday.
- Yeah, see you Monday.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.279
Hey, bruv, I think I'm coming
down with something or so,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.114
I might just slope off again,
early night.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.784
Oh, no, you don't.
Me and you are goin' for dinner,

11:25.786 --> 11:27.919
we're gonna have a catch-up.
Where'd you wanna go?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.421
Your choice.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.390
- Park Chinois.
- Come on.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.163
Well?

11:39.466 --> 11:42.701
- How's the family?
- Yes, they're good.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.969
They, uh... They ask about me?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.039
The kids do, yeah.

11:50.811 --> 11:54.012
So, uh, what about this
married woman, then?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.748
She, you know,
went back to her husband.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.085
Actually never left him.
I didn't get that far with her.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.287
Didn't make the grade.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.823
Well, you more than
made the grades.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.726
You're too good
for a situation like that.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.028
Yeah, well, it suited me.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.900
How's your financial
situation at the moment?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.870
Uh, yeah, good. Yeah,
I should be able to pay you back soon.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.939
- Everything.
- I don't care about the money.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.408
I just wanna know that you're
looking after yourself.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.244
I'm fine. I've got my job.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.013
- Got my flat. I'm okay.
- Are you?

12:29.015 --> 12:31.216
- Yeah.
- You smoke too much, you drink too much,

12:31.218 --> 12:35.787
you gamble. I can't be the
only person you owe money to.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.606
It's not like you can even
come over anymore,

12:37.607 --> 12:39.424
because you've burned every single
bridge you got with the family.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.460
You just seem to make one
bad decision after the other.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.230
- Like, dating a married woman...
- Hey!

12:45.232 --> 12:48.133
I'm not gonna stand here
and get lectured by you!

12:48.135 --> 12:50.034
Hey, I looked after you.

12:50.036 --> 12:53.505
Literally, for both Mum
and Dad when we were kids.

12:53.507 --> 12:56.274
So, just back off.
Let me make my own choices.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.177
Your mistakes, more like.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.381
Just forget dinner, all right?

13:03.383 --> 13:05.517
And go home to your wife.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.085
- Does she even know you're with me?
- Yeah.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.887
- Oh, what, she knows we're goin' to dinner?
- Yes.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.389
To the most expensive
Chinese restaurant in London?

13:13.326 --> 13:15.560
Yeah. I didn't think so.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.196
Thanks, bruv.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.265
I'll see you around.

Can I get a whiskey, please?

14:53.226 --> 14:54.292
Deal?

15:30.063 --> 15:31.496
Let me see.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.634
Full house wins.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.691
Ah.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.001
Straight wins.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.985
Players ready?

16:34.260 --> 16:35.626
Straight wins.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.060
£20,000.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.468
I've only got eight left,
all right? Just...

17:18.405 --> 17:20.637
Can't you stake me?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.107
- You pay tomorrow.
- Of course.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.178
Show me your cards.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.125
Royal flush wins.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.632
You owe me, tomorrow,
end of the day.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.068
£12,000.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.804
All right. Okay. Yeah.
Sure, I'll get your money.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.508
- Understand. I want my money tomorrow.
- All right.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.546
Are you all right?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.349
Yeah.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.455
I understand you're in trouble.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.293
We like to challenge fortune.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.430
But we also know
that the house always wins.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.165
Yeah, I guess.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.667
I, uh... I just had
a bit of bad luck, that's all.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.805
You didn't choose
your opponent wisely. Hmm?

19:01.574 --> 19:04.242
But, uh, I can help you.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.445
If you want me to.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.547
Why would you wanna help me?

19:09.549 --> 19:12.884
I invest in friendships.

19:12.886 --> 19:17.522
And I believe you can become
my trustworthy friend.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.324
I don't have myself down
as very trustworthy.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.726
My name is Lau.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.301
- And you are?
- Do you want me to help you?

19:31.204 --> 19:32.270
How?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.406
I'll pay the £12,000.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.643
But I need more than that.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.546
- How much?
- Another 50 grand.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.482
All right.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.952
Wait. What's the catch?

19:50.490 --> 19:53.457
Tomorrow, I want you to
take a flight to Amsterdam,

19:53.459 --> 19:56.794
and exchange this briefcase
for a suitcase.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.431
Then you can come back to London

20:00.433 --> 20:02.400
with that suitcase.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.669
You book a hotel.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.872
You text the address
to the number in this phone,

20:07.874 --> 20:10.541
and ditch the phone
in the canal.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.878
And at that particular address,

20:13.880 --> 20:17.582
somebody will contact you
for the exchange of the cases.

20:17.584 --> 20:21.352
- What's in the cases?
- It's better not to ask.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.956
You'll get a 6:00 a.m. flight
from Heathrow.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.492
And if I don't do it?

20:29.796 --> 20:32.363
Then we're not friends.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.700
You deal with
the consequences yourself.

20:38.004 --> 20:41.706
I pay Li the $12,000 now.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.309
And when you come back
with the suitcase,

20:45.311 --> 20:48.646
you will receive this £150,000.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.848
Plenty there to pay your debt.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.952
Okay.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.727
Oh. This man is my friend,

21:02.729 --> 21:06.397
so I take care of his debt now.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.538
We'll give you the briefcase
tomorrow morning.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.508
We'll get it through UK customs.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.278
But you have to deal
with Amsterdam security.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.814
If you lose this case,

21:23.816 --> 21:26.417
or the suitcase
that you pick up...

21:27.787 --> 21:30.354
your life will be on the line.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.027
Good luck.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.871

21:46.873 --> 21:50.708

22:34.654 --> 22:37.421

22:37.423 --> 22:40.424
<i>Look, could you give me a call
when you get this?</i>

22:40.426 --> 22:42.393
<i>This, um... This is important.</i>

24:29.135 --> 24:32.203
Um... Sorry, I think
you're in my seat.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.572
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.616
Uh, you've left your case.

24:46.219 --> 24:48.486
No, that's yours.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.878
- Sorry, do you mind?
- Um...

25:19.619 --> 25:22.052
You need to put the briefcase in
the compartment, as well, sir.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.855
Can I keep it on my lap? I've got some
things I wanna read during the flight.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.591
Okay, just pop it under the seat
in front of you, if you would.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.140
So, off to Amsterdam
for a fun weekend, eh?

25:43.142 --> 25:45.075
- Yeah.
- With friends?

25:45.778 --> 25:47.044
No.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.050
I must've read that magazine
50 times cover-to-cover.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.685
Oh.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.620
I travel so much with my work,

25:56.622 --> 25:58.889
I always bring my own
reading material.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.891
I, uh...

26:00.893 --> 26:03.294
I don't wanna be rude, um,
but I didn't get much sleep last night.

26:03.296 --> 26:04.996
I could really
do with some rest.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.697
- I'm sorry. I've been blabbering.
- That's okay.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.700
Ever since I started
in airline security,

26:09.702 --> 26:11.802
I spend a lot of time by myself.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.604
No bother.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.941
Airline security...

26:16.943 --> 26:19.076
That sounds interesting.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.811
Yes.

26:20.813 --> 26:25.683
It's my job to identify
suspicious-looking passengers.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.053
Terrorists, um, drug
smugglers, that kind of thing.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.792
I mean, we're, uh...
I mean, we're safe?

26:34.794 --> 26:36.860
Right? I mean,
there's no terrorists on board,

26:36.862 --> 26:39.763
or drug smugglers?

26:39.765 --> 26:43.000
No, there's no terrorists here.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.803
So, what's that symbol on
the front of your briefcase?

26:45.805 --> 26:47.671
- What sign?
- That one.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.873
- Looks, what, Chinese?
- Oh, I hadn't noticed it.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.743
Um, this is my brother's case.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.678
Um, probably just means
that it was

26:54.680 --> 26:56.814
made in China.
Most things are these days.

26:56.816 --> 27:00.017
Well, it's all double Dutch
to me.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.387
- Come with me.
- Hey.

27:36.389 --> 27:37.955
We can cut the line.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.423
Really?

27:45.431 --> 27:46.697
Where're they going?

27:47.233 --> 27:48.666
This man's with me.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.343
Go on.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.583
Sorry, excuse me.

28:05.584 --> 28:07.785
Would you mind if I go in front?
I'm in such a rush.

28:07.787 --> 28:08.852
Sorry, excuse me.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.356
Um, thanks for getting
me through back there.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.426
Oh, thanks aren't necessary.
I'm glad I was able to help.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.995
Look, can I offer you a lift?

28:17.997 --> 28:20.798
- Oh, no, no. Um...
- It's really no trouble.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.733
- I have a car waiting. Come on.
- Oh, okay.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.405
Get in. It's fine.

28:40.786 --> 28:43.387
I'm sorry, Robert. I haven't
properly introduced myself.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.323
I'm Herbert Summers.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.925
How do you know my name?

28:50.196 --> 28:52.229
Are you sure you don't know
what this symbol means?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.498
No.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.033
Well, it belongs
to one of the largest.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.836
Triad gangs in the world.

28:58.838 --> 29:02.806
And this case with this symbol
indicates to other Triad members

29:02.808 --> 29:05.976
that it can be received.

29:05.978 --> 29:10.247
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.750
I don't work
for airline security.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.953
Well, then, who are you?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.955
I'm a special agent
with the DEA.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.157
- Oh.
- We work in collaboration

29:20.159 --> 29:22.226
with other
international agencies.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.762
Interpol, Europol,

29:24.764 --> 29:26.130
Scotland Yard.

29:26.132 --> 29:29.099
Right now, we're tracking
one of the most important

29:29.101 --> 29:32.436
heroin conduits that's going
into the United States.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.872
And the key man
to that smuggling operation

29:34.874 --> 29:38.242
is a gentleman by the name
of Lau Hoi Ho.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.811
- Sound familiar?
- Yeah.

29:40.813 --> 29:44.148
Well, you should.
He's the one that gave you this case.

29:44.150 --> 29:47.851
He's the UK head
for a Triad gang called 14K.

29:47.853 --> 29:50.087
And this briefcase
is full of the highest quality

29:50.089 --> 29:52.289
counterfeit money in Europe.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.058
And, you, my friend,
have just been used as a mule.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.797
Now, if I opened it,

29:59.799 --> 30:02.199
I would have to send you
to prison.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.802
But you don't worry.
We're looking for bigger fish.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.305
What we do need for you
to do is make the exchange.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.242
But they'll kill me.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.145
Not if you do exactly
what they tell you to do.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.282
But that means
I'm smuggling heroin.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.819
What if I get arrested?

30:21.821 --> 30:24.087
I could lose everything.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.440
Fuck!

30:26.441 --> 30:27.824
Look, I told you
we would take care of you

30:27.827 --> 30:30.093
if you cooperate with us.

30:30.095 --> 30:33.297
We'll record your every move
in Amsterdam.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.532
We'll film the exchange.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.135
I can help you get across
the UK border

30:38.137 --> 30:40.037
with this case, like I did here.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.575
But you must
take the heroin to Lau.

30:44.577 --> 30:47.077
And then what happens to me?

30:47.079 --> 30:50.280
You cooperate with us,
you testify in court,

30:51.283 --> 30:53.884
and walk away as a free man.

30:53.886 --> 30:57.421
And this little act of misjudgment
on your part will be forgotten.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.326
We'll protect you, Robert.

31:12.104 --> 31:13.503
Your hotel.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.473
How do you know that?

31:16.475 --> 31:18.342
So, what's it gonna be?

31:21.213 --> 31:23.146
I don't have a choice, do I?

31:23.148 --> 31:24.448
Not really.

31:24.450 --> 31:30.520
Look, just do exactly what
the Chinese told you to do,

31:30.522 --> 31:32.256
and leave the rest to us.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.893
Okay, let's go.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.381
Hi, um...
Sorry, do you speak English?

31:57.383 --> 31:59.884
- I'm sorry. Can I help you?
- Yes, um,

31:59.885 --> 32:02.386
I've booked a hotel room,
and it's the same address as here.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.022
Um, I'll get my phone for you.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.992
Ah, yeah. Um, at the back,

32:08.994 --> 32:11.061
downstairs and Gerrie
will help you.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.978
- Where are you from?
- England.

32:27.980 --> 32:32.549
- England. Liverpool, Manchester?
- London.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.718
Hmm. London.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.622
Here, you smoke?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.357
- No. Thanks.
- Come on, you should try.

32:42.261 --> 32:45.295
Okay. Um...
what can I do for you?

32:45.297 --> 32:47.397
Yeah, I've made a reservation.

32:47.399 --> 32:51.101
- Ah. Name?
- Uh, Robert Atkinson.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.303
Uh-huh. Are you alone?

32:54.373 --> 32:55.439
Yeah.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.978
Oh, I'm sorry, but the room
has been double-booked.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.680
What? Don't do this to me.

33:03.682 --> 33:06.183
Um, look, I've paid in advance.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.752
Um, lemme show you.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.655
Can you hold on for a minute?
Yeah?

33:11.657 --> 33:13.290
Well, you can show me
whatever you want.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.592
But I know my rooms
are sold out.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.462
Huh? But that's okay.
I'll give you an upgrade.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.431
There's a very special place
on the canal.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.333
Oh, I'll make a call.

33:23.335 --> 33:27.004
This place is like
a palace inside.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.205
It's a lot better than here.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.374
It's just around the corner
from here.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.444
You really should explore
the nightlife in Amsterdam.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.580
- You can have great fun.
- Okay.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.216
Yeah, this place is gonna
take your breath away.

33:39.218 --> 33:42.419
It's really special,
and you'll like Vera.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.255
Yeah, she's blue-blood.
You British like that, huh?

33:46.458 --> 33:48.258
But Vera is different, you know?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.427
She... She really appreciates
this city,

33:50.429 --> 33:52.696
- all its beauty and all its flaws.
- All right.

33:52.698 --> 33:57.067
And the art she has there...
Come on, come on.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.136
We gotta go.
It's really wonderful...

34:13.318 --> 34:16.420
So, we now even have vegan...

34:18.357 --> 34:21.058
We've got everything.
Chicken, beef, vegan.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.561
Well, this is the place.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.331
What? No.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.500
This place is massive.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.668
Yeah. You have no idea.
It's very exclusive.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.804
- Yeah, but I'm not paying any more...
- No, no, no, no.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.373
You don't have to pay anything extra.
It's our mistake.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.811
Me and Vera, we always
look after each other.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.112
It's been taken care of.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.349
Eddie, hi.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.851
Well, this is the gentleman.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.654
Oh, yes, yes. I have
a very nice room for you.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.722
- Great.
- Thank you, Vera.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.425
Well, have a good time,
Robert, huh.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.594
Oh, wait, I have something
for you. Wait.

35:03.569 --> 35:08.271
Whoa! I won't need
to go to the gym tomorrow.

35:08.273 --> 35:12.175
Oh, and please do come and try
one of my special burgers, hmm?

35:12.177 --> 35:14.611
- They're the best in town.
- Okay. Yeah, will do.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.848
- Come in.
- Hi.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.588
This place is amazing.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.423
It's certainly an upgrade
from the burger joint.

35:26.425 --> 35:30.227
Oh, thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.862
How much do one of these
rooms normally go for?

35:31.864 --> 35:34.498
Oh, this isn't a hotel. Come.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.501
Gerrie is an old friend.
I help him out when he's overbooked.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.443
Can I have
your passport, please?

35:50.549 --> 35:53.250
I just need
to make a copy of it.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.718
I'll return it later,
if you don't mind.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.453
Yes, of course. Uh...

35:58.157 --> 35:59.389
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.392
These paintings are great.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.696
I have the largest collection
of this artist.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.937
You see how the frame
isolates to content

36:13.939 --> 36:16.506
of her paintings
from the outside world?

36:16.508 --> 36:19.442
Huh! What, the artist
is a woman?

36:19.444 --> 36:21.811
Oh, yes. Yes.

36:21.813 --> 36:25.382
I love that you can almost
see the layers of its history.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.184
Like a kaleidoscope.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.452
But it isn't about history,

36:29.454 --> 36:31.755
or family, or love, or...

36:33.825 --> 36:36.359
It's about the only
certainty we have in life.

36:38.297 --> 36:39.496
Impermanence.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.399
Oh, yeah.

36:42.401 --> 36:45.869
It's closest to the kitchen,
in case you need anything.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.471
If you smoke,
please use the garden.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.342
Is that all your luggage?

36:52.344 --> 36:54.978
Uh, it's just a short visit.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.447
Well, this is your room.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.449
It's fresh and clean.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.821
If you need anything,
I'll be upstairs.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.923
Thank you. Uh, sorry, Miss...

37:06.925 --> 37:08.758
Oh, Vera Tribbe.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.894
But, please, call me Vera.

37:10.896 --> 37:11.995
Okay.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.002
You're different from other men.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.241
No one's ever said that
about me before.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.910
Just make yourself comfortable.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.246
A yell, and I'll be here
in a flash.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.516
Papa, please!

38:39.518 --> 38:41.584
You're hurting me.

38:41.586 --> 38:43.019
He can hear you.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.456
I don't care. I want him
out of here now!

38:46.458 --> 38:47.791
- Papa.
- You hear me?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.705
Yes.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.976
Are you awake?

39:08.447 --> 39:09.913
Well, I am now.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.048
May I come in?

39:12.050 --> 39:15.585
Uh, one sec.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.131
Did I get you in trouble?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.868
It's just my father.

39:31.870 --> 39:36.439
I... I didn't realize I was intruding
into a family home. I'm sorry.

39:36.441 --> 39:37.974
Me and families don't
really do too well...

39:37.976 --> 39:40.777
No, no, no. Not at all. Please.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.645
I'm sorry for his behavior.

39:42.647 --> 39:45.148
No, honestly, it's fine.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.388
Are you hungry?

39:51.390 --> 39:54.758
Uh, I was just about to eat
something and I thought...

39:54.760 --> 39:56.860
Well, I thought
maybe you could join me?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.762
Um...

40:00.165 --> 40:02.432
Sure. Thanks.

40:02.434 --> 40:05.969
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll bring dinner and something to drink.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.070
Great. Thank you.

40:25.557 --> 40:28.158
So, here we are.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.693
Oh, great. Thank you.

40:30.695 --> 40:31.795
Let me get that for you.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.932
- Wow, great place.
- Thank you.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.803
Cheers.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.325
Hmm.

40:45.326 --> 40:47.843
Help yourself. Bread and cheese
was a luxury at one time.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.713
Potatoes sustained this country

40:50.715 --> 40:52.849
through the war
when we had nothing.

40:52.851 --> 40:56.219
People would walk miles
just to eat tulip bulbs.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.655
- Really?
- Hmm.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.024
Well, I just realized I haven't
eaten since yesterday.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.028
What is that?

41:05.030 --> 41:08.198
This knife is from
the fourth century.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.900
It's been in my family
for generations.

41:15.106 --> 41:16.473
Try it.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.983
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. It's good.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.855
So, why are you in Amsterdam?

41:32.924 --> 41:37.193
Are you interested in
any of our museums?

41:37.195 --> 41:39.729
The coffee shops?
The red light district?

41:39.731 --> 41:41.998
Oh, no. Not at all.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.167
We had to build up
the city after the war,

41:44.169 --> 41:47.804
only to watch tourists
use it as a brothel.

41:47.806 --> 41:51.274
Those poor women are used until
they're nearly split in half.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.045
Yeah, but,
it's legal here, right?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.816
So that is why you're here.

41:59.818 --> 42:02.852
No, no. I just mean
it's part of the economy.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.155
Well, men have their needs
when a wife can't fulfill them.

42:09.661 --> 42:11.594
Look, um, I uh...

42:11.596 --> 42:13.596
Sorry, I've just remembered
something really important.

42:13.598 --> 42:17.300
Do you have an adaptor
for a British plug?

42:17.302 --> 42:19.035
I need to charge my phone.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.671
No.

42:21.672 --> 42:23.705
Right. Well, then, I need to get one.
This is really important.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.542
All the shops are closed now.

42:25.544 --> 42:28.311
What, really? Nowhere's open?

42:28.313 --> 42:30.880
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
This cannot wait till tomorrow.

42:30.882 --> 42:34.551
But wait, uh, Gerrie may have one.
I'll call him.

42:34.553 --> 42:36.819
Great. Yeah.
Brilliant. If you could.

42:45.864 --> 42:49.065
Hey, Gerrie. It's Vera.

43:04.049 --> 43:05.748
It's your lucky day.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.850
- He has one.
- Are you serious?

43:07.852 --> 43:10.653
He's out on an errand.
He'll bring it later.

43:10.655 --> 43:12.655
Look, if... If you want me to,

43:12.657 --> 43:15.158
I can ask Gerrie if he's had any
cancellations when he gets here.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.160
- No, no, no, please.
- I don't want to be any trouble.

43:17.162 --> 43:20.263
You're no trouble.
I like your company.

43:22.834 --> 43:24.200
My father, he...

43:26.071 --> 43:29.372
He doesn't mean to be rude.
It's not his fault.

43:32.010 --> 43:35.645
Uh, could you show me
where the garden is again?

43:35.647 --> 43:37.680
- I need to...
- Oh, yes, yes. Of course.

43:37.682 --> 43:39.215
Great.

43:39.217 --> 43:41.250
So all this space
for just you and your father?

43:41.252 --> 43:42.802
Yes.

43:42.803 --> 43:44.353
And he spends most
of his time in his room, huh?

43:44.356 --> 43:46.389
Yes. All the time.

43:46.391 --> 43:47.857
Do you never get to
take him out?

43:48.660 --> 43:49.959
Never.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.259
And have you always
looked after him?

43:51.262 --> 43:52.762
Always.

43:52.764 --> 43:54.664
So, no children or husband?

43:58.036 --> 43:59.135
No.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.704
Do you have a job?

44:01.706 --> 44:05.408
No. I was hoping to study
art restoration,

44:05.410 --> 44:08.244
but I just look after
the house now.

44:08.246 --> 44:09.812
Can't leave my father alone.

44:23.695 --> 44:24.894
You could go.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.230
I mean, leave your father.

44:29.134 --> 44:31.651
Why?

44:31.652 --> 44:34.169
Well, it just feels like you're
kind of like a prisoner here.

44:37.108 --> 44:38.307
And go where?

44:40.111 --> 44:43.246
- My father is a good man.
- Of course, he is.

44:43.248 --> 44:45.381
Certainly sounds better
than my father.

44:45.383 --> 44:48.384
My father was a brute,
to me and my mother.

44:50.221 --> 44:54.090
My little brother managed to escape
it, but me and my mum weren't so lucky.

44:57.295 --> 44:59.228
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

45:03.368 --> 45:05.301
When he felt like it,
he just lashed out.

45:06.237 --> 45:07.970
Usually after he'd had a drink.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.475
My father was very affectionate
with me when he drank.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.111
What do you mean?

45:16.114 --> 45:17.313
He had no wife.

45:19.951 --> 45:22.318
- He needed my love.
- What?

45:22.320 --> 45:23.486
Shh.

45:24.823 --> 45:25.922
He might hear us.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.157
Are you afraid of him?

45:30.295 --> 45:31.494
What did he do to you?

45:31.496 --> 45:33.329
Shh. Please.

45:33.331 --> 45:34.997
You know what, you should leave.
Just fuck him.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.299
Don't talk about him like that.

45:36.301 --> 45:40.470
Who are you, coming into
his house, enjoying his food,

45:40.472 --> 45:42.972
his wine, his bed?

45:42.974 --> 45:45.007
Maybe you are like the others.

45:45.009 --> 45:49.912
I... I'm sorry. Hey,
I shouldn't have said that.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.567
I've got a really hard day tomorrow.
I should get some sleep.

46:00.058 --> 46:04.193
Wait. I'm sorry. I'm...

46:07.198 --> 46:08.531
I wanna show you something.

46:12.904 --> 46:14.971
Isn't it beautiful?

46:14.973 --> 46:19.175
My father had it built specially
when he renovated the place.

46:20.879 --> 46:23.012
Take a dip.

46:23.481 --> 46:26.048
It's very relaxing.

46:26.050 --> 46:28.251
Oh, no, I've...
Not brought my trunks or anything.

46:28.253 --> 46:31.254
Please, I feel so bad
that I snapped at you.

46:32.223 --> 46:34.257
You've got trunks.

46:35.860 --> 46:36.926
Okay.

46:40.064 --> 46:42.031
He'll be asleep now.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.432
I'll go and get more wine.

47:33.218 --> 47:34.884
No, Papa!

47:35.386 --> 47:37.186
Please!

47:37.188 --> 47:38.988
I told you to get rid of him!

47:41.459 --> 47:42.625
Please!

47:49.267 --> 47:52.902
Thank God.
I thought you were your father.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.939
He's not coming
down here, is he?

47:58.576 --> 48:00.476
Look, I don't understand.
Do I have to leave?

48:02.180 --> 48:03.346
I want you to stay.

48:04.382 --> 48:05.514
Here.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.592
Hmm.

48:18.296 --> 48:20.296
It's my father's wine
from the cellar.

48:21.032 --> 48:23.199
Chateau Lafite Rothschild.

48:24.302 --> 48:25.401
It's nice.

48:30.108 --> 48:32.642
He would get so angry if he
knew we were drinking it.

48:35.046 --> 48:36.379
Like your father.

48:36.381 --> 48:38.681
Yeah.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.684
Also...

48:49.427 --> 48:51.427
My father's dead.

48:51.429 --> 48:55.331
So, my father's good with money.

48:56.167 --> 48:57.400
Yours isn't.

48:57.402 --> 48:59.135
I'm not feeling well.

49:07.979 --> 49:10.413
What have you done?

49:10.415 --> 49:12.381
What have you done?

49:13.017 --> 49:14.383
I don't feel...

50:30.128 --> 50:31.394
Oh, hi!

50:32.130 --> 50:34.497
<i>Vera, did I wake you?</i>

50:34.499 --> 50:36.465
Of course not, Uncle.

50:38.503 --> 50:39.602
I'll be right back.

50:45.476 --> 50:47.143
Well, I was worried.

50:47.145 --> 50:49.211
You know, I was standing
outside, and ringing and ringing.

50:49.213 --> 50:51.414
Aw, you brought croissants!

50:51.416 --> 50:53.115
Did you hear what I just
said, Vera?

50:53.117 --> 50:54.784
I was waiting outside.

50:54.786 --> 50:58.587
Yes, yes, yes, sorry.
I was in the kitchen.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.424
No need to worry.

51:01.426 --> 51:04.093
Well, okay.

51:04.562 --> 51:05.661
Okay.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.497
- Coffee?
- No. Not for me, thanks.

51:08.499 --> 51:10.066
I won't be staying that long.

51:10.635 --> 51:12.234
Hmm.

51:12.236 --> 51:16.138
Vera, are you sure you're okay?

51:16.140 --> 51:18.407
- Yes.
- If you need anything,

51:19.377 --> 51:21.610
anything, just call me. Yeah?

51:23.281 --> 51:24.413
I know.

51:29.654 --> 51:31.821
- What's that on your dress?
- What?

51:33.291 --> 51:34.423
Oh.

51:35.726 --> 51:38.761
I was grinding some meat.
Rabbit.

51:40.331 --> 51:43.332
Well, you said
you were going somewhere?

51:43.334 --> 51:46.602
Yes. I'm off to my club,
actually.

51:49.574 --> 51:51.140
Okay, my sweetie little niece.

51:54.161 --> 51:56.612
Do be careful.
You know how much I care about you, hmm?

52:27.812 --> 52:31.881
My father was right.
You are like the others.

52:32.650 --> 52:34.650
But I can cleanse you.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.831
No! No!

52:59.477 --> 53:00.776
Stay still, please.

53:01.412 --> 53:02.545
Thank you.

53:13.191 --> 53:14.290
What?

53:15.393 --> 53:18.694
Don't do this, please!
Let me go!

53:19.363 --> 53:20.930
Help!

53:21.432 --> 53:22.831
Don't!

53:25.570 --> 53:26.835
Try not to move.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.249
<i>Hi.</i>

53:40.251 --> 53:41.650
I'm looking for Robert.

53:48.326 --> 53:51.927
Hi, I'm sorry, but there's
no one called Robert here.

53:51.929 --> 53:54.597
I know he's staying here.

53:54.599 --> 53:57.333
There's nobody here.
Please go away.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.306
Where's Robert?

54:04.308 --> 54:06.809
I don't know who Robert is,
I swear.

54:08.379 --> 54:10.946
I know he's here.
If you don't tell me where he is,

54:10.948 --> 54:14.416
I will take out your eyes
and then your ears.

54:14.418 --> 54:16.018
Do you understand?

54:16.020 --> 54:18.754
I'll count to three. One!

54:18.756 --> 54:20.990
- Two, three!
- Stop, stop!

54:21.859 --> 54:24.393
He's here. He's here.

54:24.395 --> 54:26.562
- What have you done with him?
- Please. Nothing.

54:26.564 --> 54:28.330
I'll take you to him. Please.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Now!

54:33.904 --> 54:35.371
He's in there.

54:35.740 --> 54:36.805
Open it!

54:40.945 --> 54:42.411
Hurry up!

54:43.748 --> 54:45.447
It's stuck.

54:45.449 --> 54:46.582
Move!

55:43.541 --> 55:44.973
I fucking hate disturbances.

56:01.826 --> 56:03.859
Yeah, do your thing.

56:07.098 --> 56:09.798
Hmm.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.511
I told you not to move.

56:29.153 --> 56:31.120
Please, don't...

56:32.523 --> 56:33.956
Please, don't do this. Please.

56:36.827 --> 56:37.993
Vera.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.501
You can let me go.

56:45.503 --> 56:47.102
Please, don't do this.

59:45.950 --> 59:47.916
You're all right.
You're safe now.

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:25.687
Something went wrong.

01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:30.025
Neither of them answered
my calls or messages,

01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:31.860
and they never left the house.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.862
We need to get in that house.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:36.932
But how? She has nothing
to do with your operation.

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:40.936
The mission's over.
Lau walks free.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.807
We are so close.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:49.211
I know it's slow progress,
but we can't stop now.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.180
You did the right thing.

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:56.218
Just hang in there
and we'll get Lau.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.753
We can put him in prison.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:00.255
But not for murder.

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:02.257
He'll get what he deserves.

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:04.726
Locking him up doesn't free
us from men like Lau.

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:07.996
Locking him up allows us
to pump him for information.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.698
We'll cut the head off the snake

01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:12.200
and save innocent lives.

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:14.870
Lau will pay.

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.305
You'll have your revenge.

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:31.720
- Hi.
- Hi. What's the emergency?

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.093
It's your brother.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.994
Robert and £50,000 in cash
have gone missing.

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:43.198
- What?
- He closed the bank on Friday.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.200
I was with him
as he closed the bank.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.401
Was he carrying anything?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:50.756
Just his bag.

01:01:50.757 --> 01:01:51.473
I'm not going to lose
my job over this.

01:01:51.475 --> 01:01:53.435
And I don't want to get
your brother into trouble,

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.244
but I need that money back.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:59.748
Now, the police are on their way
to pick up the security tapes.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.017
- So...
- I'll find him.

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:04.698
- I'll expect to hear from you by the end of today day, yes?
- Yeah.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:06.955
Excuse me.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.365
He went to Amsterdam.

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:19.801
He sent me a photo.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:24.439
All right. Forward it to me.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:28.009
- If you hear anything, let me know, okay?
- Okay.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.479
Thank you.

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.401
Chief Vanderbilt,
these two people haven't just

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:30.305
vanished into thin air.
They're still in the house.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.275
I would be out of a job if
we entered a particular house

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:35.243
without any solid evidence.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.379
You need a warrant
and I cannot give you one...

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:38.547
I'm missing my key witness.

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:43.385
That's Albert Tribbe's
niece's house.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:47.489
That family is the most
powerful family in the city.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:51.860
And I don't think they really
need to get involved in narcotics.

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:54.830
- I don't think it's about narcotics. I think it's about...
- Whatever it is,

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:56.531
it's out of bounds, Mr. Summers.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:59.034
Then let me speak to the uncle.

01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:00.869
I don't think
you are understanding this.

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:05.106
This city is my jurisdiction.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:09.211
And I'm telling you to stand well
away from the house and the family.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:12.247
And if I see you anywhere
near her house, or her uncle,

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:15.250
you will be arrested and on
the next flight to the US.

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:45.213
Hi, uh...

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.514
I was wondering if you'd seen...

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:48.116
If you'd seen this man?

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:50.252
He was in here
last Sunday night.

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:53.154
Wait here.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:04.900
Get off me!

01:05:13.677 --> 01:05:17.112
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Wallet, now!

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:18.947
Here, take it, take it.
It's yours.

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:30.292
What is your connection
with Robert Atkinson?

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:33.361
He's my brother.

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:36.431
Why are you looking
for him here?

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:40.535
Uh, he's been missing since Friday,
and this is the last place he was seen.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.372
- Have you called the police?
- No.

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:49.311
Smart man.
You have a nice family.

01:05:52.316 --> 01:05:55.617
Your brother is doing
something for me.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:58.153
Because as a friend,
I helped him.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.623
But it appears
he has betrayed...

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.024
What was he doing for you?

01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:08.096
So now, you go to Amsterdam
to find him.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:15.170
And make sure he comes back
with what belongs to me.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:17.739
- And what is that?
- You ask me too many questions.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:22.577
If you don't come back with
your brother and my property,

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:28.383
I'll be paying a visit
to your wife and kids.

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:44.499
Yeah. I need to speak
to my wife. Tell her I'm...

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.634
No messages to anyone.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:50.271
Go.

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:57.512
My assistant will meet
you at Schiphol.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.529
Hey, Rob, it's Steve.

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:17.799
If you're there, mate,
please pick up.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.771
I don't care what you've done.
I just want to know that you're all right.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:26.708
I'm so sorry I didn't
pick up your call.

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.111
I'm coming to Amsterdam
to get you.

01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.451
Yes. Yes.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:40.388
But, sir, we're so close.

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:45.660
I can't be sure.
He's disappeared, off the grid completely.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:47.262
It doesn't make any sense.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:51.166
But we can get into
the house another way.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:55.203
Yes, I do know
how much this case costs.

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:57.839
That's why I'm saying we have to
keep going. We're almost there.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:03.511
I think you're
making a mistake, sir.

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:05.280
We almost have him, please.

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:09.617
Yes, Chief. I understand.

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:35.276
Steve Atkinson?

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.313
- Yes.
- Come with me.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.282
Are you with Lau?

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.685
Where's my brother?

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:46.587
Let's go.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:58.733
Hello, Steve.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.368
My name is Herbert Summers.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:02.737
I'm from
the United States government.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:06.207
I work with
the Drug Enforcement Agency.

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:09.777
We've been investigating a major
Chinese drug-trafficking operation,

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.912
and your brother was helping us.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:13.448
What?

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.616
You know where he is?

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:16.651
Jun Hui works undercover for us.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.486
She followed him to a house,

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.488
and he never returned.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.657
And that was the last
we saw of him.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.859
We've been monitoring
every exit.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:26.761
He hasn't left the house.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:28.196
And I cannot get through to him.

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:29.731
Wait. What was he doing for you?

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:31.232
Your brother was set up.

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.167
We stepped in
and he agreed to help us.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.335
Set up how?

01:09:37.374 --> 01:09:39.274
Your brother lost a poker game.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:48.216
And in exchange, your brother
agreed, although I must say,

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:51.252
unknowingly,
to smuggle heroin for him.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.861
That's why he left me
that voicemail.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:02.497
Ah, I ordered
for the three of us.

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:04.632
- The best in town.
- Thanks.

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:10.271
Robert actually booked
a room here.

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.907
Although it seems that the owner
took him directly to the house.

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:15.410
Has anyone been into the house?

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:18.246
It's owned by one of the
wealthiest women in the city.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:19.614
She never leaves her property.

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:22.450
She's like a recluse,
or a hermit.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.536
So why haven't you just
raided the house?

01:10:24.537 --> 01:10:26.621
It's the most powerful family
in Amsterdam.

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:28.323
Local police don't want
to get involved,

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:30.225
and we just don't have
the jurisdiction here.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.230
- So now what?
- We have a plan.

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:38.399
And you're gonna help.

01:10:44.307 --> 01:10:45.373
It's okay.

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:51.179
<i>Hello?</i>

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.848
Hi. Um, we received a photo from a friend
who stayed with you a couple of nights ago,

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:57.619
and we were wondering if you had a
room we could rent for a few nights.

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:07.629
Hi. Um, there is
no one staying here.

01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:08.997
I'm sorry.

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:11.466
Um, Robert texted us
this address, didn't he?

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:14.702
Yeah, yeah. He, um...
He even sent us a photo of the room.

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:16.804
It looks so romantic.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.406
Robert said we'd love it.

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:22.877
Well, you better come in then.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.990
He was right.

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:38.293
This house is beautiful.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.932
Sorry. No pictures, please.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.534
Oh. Of course.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:48.069
This way.

01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:58.480
Wow.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.548
Can't imagine how Robert could
afford to stay in a place like this.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.616
Well...

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:05.353
It's 200 euros.

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:10.958
Each.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:15.530
Thank you.

01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:17.565
May I have
your passports, please?

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:20.518
Sure.

01:12:20.519 --> 01:12:22.669
I'll make a copy and
return them to you later.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:23.738
Thank you.

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:27.442
Thank you.

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:36.617
So, are we
the only guests, then?

01:12:38.088 --> 01:12:39.354
Yes.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.061
I'll show you up to your room.

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:50.798
This is your room.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.407
It's a shame that
Robert had to leave.

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:03.845
Yeah. When did he go?

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:05.546
Yesterday.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:08.082
If you want to smoke,
please use the garden.

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:09.150
Thank you.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:12.954
You live here all by yourself?

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:17.425
Sort of.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:20.561
My father, he lives upstairs.
He's ill.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:23.464
It's like living alone.

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:26.834
Have a lovely stay.

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:37.745
This was Robert's room.

01:13:54.497 --> 01:13:55.897
This is Lau's briefcase.

01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:57.865
He gave it to Robert.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:59.100
What the hell is in it?

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:05.039
It's all here.

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:28.729
Hey, keep an eye out.

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:47.748
Papa...

01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:52.053
Are you awake?

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:53.120
Of course I am.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:56.924
Who are you
talking to down there?

01:14:58.194 --> 01:14:59.494
Guests.

01:15:02.532 --> 01:15:04.932
Papa, I think one of them is...

01:15:04.934 --> 01:15:06.601
Is who?

01:15:09.572 --> 01:15:11.172
We might have a problem.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:13.875
Come in.

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:15.943
I can help.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:31.859
Think, child.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.694
Have they been truthful
with you?

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.863
Have they asked you
awkward questions?

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.799
- But Papa...
- Vera...

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:42.720
my daughter...

01:15:42.721 --> 01:15:45.672
Beware, even those who look
innocent can be dangerous.

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.825
- Sorry about the noise.
- What happened?

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.160
She left.

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:09.931
Some people are never happy,

01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:11.332
no matter how much
you do for 'em.

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:13.834
Hmm.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.670
You want a drink?

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:19.807
Yeah, thanks. Tea?

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:23.144
Maybe something stronger?

01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:25.613
Give me five minutes,
I was about to help my father

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:27.315
- into bed.
- Okay.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:48.836
She's asked me for a drink.
Have you found anything?

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:51.322
- Not yet.
<i>- All right.</i>

01:16:51.323 --> 01:16:54.283
Keep the line open. I'll try and keep
her talking so you know where she is.

01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:56.677
Here you are.

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:57.745
Thanks.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:01.849
- Was that your girlfriend?
- No.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.986
<i>Cheers.</i>

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:12.326
<i>So, how long
have you been together?</i>

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.196
<i>About two years.</i>

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:18.165
Wow. She's very lucky.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.803
If she's not careful,
she'll lose you.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.807
She's just a bit upset.
She'll come around.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:30.128
Mm-hmm.

01:17:30.129 --> 01:17:31.609
Why don't you
come and see the garden?

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:33.114
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:57.772
<i>Wow.</i>

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:00.341
<i>It's nice.</i>

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:06.847
So, what did you argue about?

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.116
Uh, it was nothing, really.

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:15.723
<i>She'll be back soon...</i>

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:18.006
As soon as she's spent all my
money on a bunch of rubbish.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.262
<i>You're good with money?</i>

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:29.804
<i>Your father taught you well.</i>

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:31.806
<i>My father?</i>

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:36.811
Not really.

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:38.979
My brother is, though.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.025
Hello?

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:58.199
Always looked after me,
always protected me.

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:00.968
That must be nice,

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.738
having someone to protect you.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.321
How about another drink?

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:22.957
Yes. Of course.

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:28.896
Jun?

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.660
- Pardon?
- Table for one, sir?

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.027
No, no, no. Thank you.
I'm here to meet someone.

01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:50.731
Excuse me. Sir, you can't...

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:04.561
Mr. Tribbe.

01:23:04.562 --> 01:23:05.511
Herbert Summers.
May I have a word, please?

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:07.481
I'm sorry, Mr. Tribbe.

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.116
It concerns your niece.

01:23:12.054 --> 01:23:13.120
It's okay.

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:18.158
Please.

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:27.267
I'm with the DEA.

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:30.371
We're tracking a heroin-smuggling
operation into Amsterdam.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.774
And, I'm sorry,
how does my niece

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:37.211
fit into this, Mr. Summers?

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:39.680
I've got
a table of friends waiting.

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:42.683
Our man was working undercover.
He's disappeared.

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:45.285
He was last seen going
into your niece's house.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:49.523
You know, lots of people
disappear in this city.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.558
In fact, they come here
to disappear,

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.128
from their wives,
their fiancees.

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:57.364
They usually turn up
after a couple of days.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:00.567
- You look in the clubs?
- Mr. Tribbe.

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:03.404
I'm so sorry you have
been bothered with this.

01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:05.572
We'll take you
straight to the airport.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.441
Mr. Summers is leaving now.

01:24:08.778 --> 01:24:11.178
Mr. Tribbe, please.

01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:14.181
Look.

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:18.285
My God.

01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:20.387
It's okay.

01:24:21.424 --> 01:24:23.657
You tell me everything.

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:30.631
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm. Fine.

01:24:33.769 --> 01:24:34.835
Cheers.

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:36.804
Cheers.

01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:41.175
Ooh!

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:42.609
It's strong.

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:45.312
What is it?

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:46.713
My father's cognac.

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:48.849
Do you like it?

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:51.718
Yeah. It's great.

01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:53.187
Good.

01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:08.836
Why are you here, Steve?

01:25:11.173 --> 01:25:12.439
Really.

01:25:16.512 --> 01:25:17.511
Wh... What?

01:25:17.512 --> 01:25:18.992
Are you here
looking for your brother?

01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:20.781
Hmm?

01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:25.252
What have you done?

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:51.512
Steve!

01:25:51.514 --> 01:25:53.680
Steve, wake up! Steve, wake up!

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.186
Hi.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:00.254
What are you doing?

01:26:02.191 --> 01:26:03.423
What are you doing?

01:26:04.527 --> 01:26:05.592
Take it off!

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:09.730
What the fuck are you doing?
Let me go!

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:12.399
You sound
just like your brother.

01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:16.803
What did you do to him?

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:21.308
What did you do to him?

01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:25.679
You'll see.

01:26:31.487 --> 01:26:33.220
No. No, no, no!

01:26:33.222 --> 01:26:34.855
- Help!
- Get away from him!

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:36.557
Stop, stop! Please, please!

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:41.261
No! Fuck!

01:26:41.263 --> 01:26:43.964
Get off him!

01:26:54.777 --> 01:26:56.443
- Yes?
- Help!

01:26:56.445 --> 01:26:59.246
<i>Vera, can I come in?</i>

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:02.950
- Coming.
- Help.

01:27:03.619 --> 01:27:04.685
Fuck!

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:09.623
Time's up.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.266
Can I come in?

01:27:19.268 --> 01:27:20.334
Yeah. Sure.

01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:31.912
I know about your father.

01:27:37.653 --> 01:27:39.353
What do you mean?

01:27:39.355 --> 01:27:42.389
I know you didn't mean it.

01:27:42.391 --> 01:27:44.725
And he was strict with you,
but he did love you.

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:54.701
I know.

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:03.877
I know he loved me.

01:28:06.682 --> 01:28:09.650
When Mother died, he married me.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:13.387
What do you mean,
he married you?

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:18.358
He had no one else.

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:22.029
And someone
had to take care of him.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:26.800
And I loved him.

01:28:29.705 --> 01:28:32.372
But then... But then he...

01:28:35.077 --> 01:28:36.343
He what?

01:28:41.083 --> 01:28:45.986
Then he took our child away
and drowned her in the canal.

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:50.324
He said it was his and he could
do whatever he wanted, but...

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:55.495
But it was my child, too.

01:28:57.366 --> 01:28:58.832
No more baby.

01:29:04.073 --> 01:29:05.772
I'm so sorry, dear...

01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:08.375
But it's for your own good.

01:29:16.118 --> 01:29:17.684
Hey, arrest her.

01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:23.423
What have you done with them?

01:29:23.425 --> 01:29:24.491
Where are they?

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:29.796
Vera, you know I'll always
take care of you.

01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:33.133
But now you have to tell me
where they are.

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:46.413
Open this door. Open it!

01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:49.750
No, no, no, no. Please.

01:29:49.752 --> 01:29:50.817
Come on.

01:29:56.392 --> 01:29:57.758
Jun!

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:01.795
Steve.

01:30:03.165 --> 01:30:05.766
Down there!

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:10.971
Hey, Jun? Jun? Jun?

01:30:10.973 --> 01:30:12.139
- Jun, are you all right?
- Help me out, man.

01:30:12.141 --> 01:30:14.074
Find me the keys. Jun?

01:30:15.778 --> 01:30:17.944
- Quickly!
- Got 'em.

01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:23.717
Just a second.

01:30:29.425 --> 01:30:31.491
It's okay. You're all right.

01:30:31.493 --> 01:30:32.592
You're safe now.

01:30:50.512 --> 01:30:52.179
Just go with them for now,

01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:54.014
and this will all be
over shortly.

01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:09.863
I'm gonna need some sample
of those buckets,

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:12.132
- check for DNA.
- Yeah.

01:31:13.869 --> 01:31:15.635
Send a team to Gerrie's bar.

01:31:15.637 --> 01:31:17.604
Arrest him. Shut the place down.

01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:22.843
See you.

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.177
They did a background check
on Gerrie.

01:31:24.179 --> 01:31:26.947
Turns out that he actually
worked for Vera's father.

01:31:28.851 --> 01:31:33.620
Long list of priors
including attempted murder.

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:35.589
When he got out of prison,
he couldn't find any work,

01:31:35.591 --> 01:31:38.725
so he went to Vera for help. She
actually bought him that burger joint...

01:31:39.695 --> 01:31:42.562
In exchange for services.

01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:48.034
- You okay?
- I want to go home.

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:50.003
Just take them to the hotel.

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.705
I will send a doctor over there.

01:31:55.077 --> 01:31:57.210
Thank you for everything.

01:31:57.212 --> 01:31:58.278
I'm sorry.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:06.920
You'll be okay?

01:32:08.724 --> 01:32:09.789
Yeah.

01:32:47.162 --> 01:32:48.228
Hey.

01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:56.636
Have you thought about
what we said last night?

01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.105
There's no other way?

01:33:00.142 --> 01:33:02.075
No. I wish there was.

01:33:04.146 --> 01:33:05.245
Look, Steve,

01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:07.047
I know it's dangerous.

01:33:08.016 --> 01:33:09.616
But unless you
make the exchange,

01:33:09.618 --> 01:33:11.885
they're gonna come after
you and your family.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:18.959
What if I pay him the money
he gave to Robert?

01:33:18.961 --> 01:33:20.994
For Lau,
it's not about that money.

01:33:22.197 --> 01:33:26.032
Your brother was supposed
to smuggle heroin for him.

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:28.868
And that's much more valuable
than the money he lent Robert.

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:31.171
Several million
on the open market.

01:33:32.174 --> 01:33:33.807
Look, Steve, I...

01:33:37.012 --> 01:33:38.078
Don't worry.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:40.780
We'll take care of you.

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.082
Like you did with my brother?

01:33:47.923 --> 01:33:48.989
Fine.

01:33:50.359 --> 01:33:51.625
I'll do it.

01:33:58.734 --> 01:34:01.801
The exchange will take place this
afternoon at Schiphol car park.

01:35:12.407 --> 01:35:14.140
The brother returns.

01:35:18.447 --> 01:35:19.779
I believe that's yours.

01:35:24.186 --> 01:35:26.019
Well done.

01:35:26.021 --> 01:35:29.789
I had my doubts,
but it appears you came through.

01:35:29.791 --> 01:35:30.857
So that's it?

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.826
Robert's debt's paid?

01:35:34.296 --> 01:35:36.262
Yes. We're even.

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:41.034
Yeah. Even.

01:35:43.305 --> 01:35:45.038
I heard about your brother.

01:35:48.877 --> 01:35:50.777
Terrible way to go.

01:35:57.853 --> 01:35:59.853
Armed police!
Get your hands on your head!

01:36:01.223 --> 01:36:03.289
- Armed police!
- Don't you move.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.993
Whatever you say may be used as evidence.
Do you understand?

01:36:06.995 --> 01:36:08.061
Piss off.

01:36:09.798 --> 01:36:11.678
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say to you?

01:36:12.534 --> 01:36:14.067
Sergeant, cuff 'em.

01:36:15.904 --> 01:36:19.239
I am cautioning you.
You have the right to remain silent.

01:36:19.241 --> 01:36:22.308
Any evidence used against you
will be used in a court of law.

01:36:23.378 --> 01:36:25.411
You have a right
to legal representation.

01:36:25.413 --> 01:36:28.848
If you do not have a lawyer,
we'll provide one for you.

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:31.017
- Moving one!
- Please move two.

01:36:49.905 --> 01:36:52.071
I need to thank you for
everything you've done for us.

01:36:53.508 --> 01:36:55.809
I don't think we could've
done it without you.

01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:57.043
Thank you for everything.

01:36:58.213 --> 01:36:59.445
I'm finally free.

01:37:02.951 --> 01:37:06.886
No person should have to take
on the sins of his family.

01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:11.391
There was nothing you
could've done to prevent it.

01:37:13.228 --> 01:37:15.295
We can choose any road.

01:37:16.131 --> 01:37:18.097
Even on the wrong path,

01:37:18.099 --> 01:37:20.200
sacrifices will be made,

01:37:20.936 --> 01:37:23.937
and justifications.

01:37:23.939 --> 01:37:26.539
One bad decision
leads to another.

01:37:28.143 --> 01:37:29.976
This was his road

01:37:30.378 --> 01:37:31.945
that he chose.

01:37:34.049 --> 01:37:37.217
The best advice that I
can give you in this case

01:37:37.219 --> 01:37:40.086
is that you need
to forgive yourself,

01:37:41.122 --> 01:37:42.522
and your parents,

01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:45.024
and your brother.

01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:50.263
Forgive yourself.

01:38:03.278 --> 01:38:04.344
