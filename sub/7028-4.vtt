18:15.431 --> 18:16.697
Ana, Ana.

18:16.699 --> 18:19.767
Ana, Ana, are you okay?

18:22.038 --> 18:23.270
Are you on drugs?

18:23.272 --> 18:24.638
You can tell me,
but don't tell me,

18:24.640 --> 18:26.207
because then legally
I'd have to fire you.

18:26.209 --> 18:29.977
James, I can't do this
anymore, okay?

18:29.979 --> 18:31.712
I'm not Pasión.

18:31.714 --> 18:35.950
I don't like salsa dancing.
I don't speak Spanish.

18:35.952 --> 18:37.985
This isn't the real me.

18:37.987 --> 18:39.854
None of this is the real me.

18:42.124 --> 18:43.958
Those just pop
right out, do they?

18:43.960 --> 18:45.559
The real me
likes eating cheese puffs

18:45.561 --> 18:47.661
and relies heavily
on boob tape for cleavage.

18:47.663 --> 18:49.463
I don't like spicy food.

18:49.465 --> 18:50.998
I saw that.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.300
The truth is I'm pretty normal.

18:53.302 --> 18:55.469
My real life
is not a telenovela.

18:55.471 --> 18:57.471
And the truth is
I'm relieved to hear that,

18:57.473 --> 19:00.741
because Pasión...
she's a little intense, right?

19:00.743 --> 19:02.543
She's crazy.
You're not.

19:02.545 --> 19:04.912
She's crazy,
and I don't want to date her.

19:04.914 --> 19:07.481
I want to date the girl
who leaves cheese puff prints

19:07.483 --> 19:10.317
on the back of my suit...

19:10.319 --> 19:11.886
and uses the wall
to scratch your back

19:11.888 --> 19:14.054
and climbs out car windows
instead of re-parking.

19:14.056 --> 19:15.856
- You saw that?
- I see everything.

19:15.858 --> 19:17.324
I told you...
there's cameras everywhere.

19:17.326 --> 19:20.861
Ana, look...

19:20.863 --> 19:23.330
the little bit of you
that you've allowed me to see

19:23.332 --> 19:26.734
I think is pretty great,
and I'd like to see more.

19:26.736 --> 19:29.503
I want to date you, Ana.

19:33.075 --> 19:34.775
Kiss me.

19:34.777 --> 19:36.343
Shh.

19:36.345 --> 19:38.913
I'm sorry.
That's muscle memory.

19:38.915 --> 19:41.549
Okay, come on.

19:41.551 --> 19:43.450
Mm.

19:43.452 --> 19:46.887
<i>♪ But you're beautiful</i>
<i>in the way you dress ♪</i>

19:46.889 --> 19:48.422

19:48.424 --> 19:50.090

Oh, okay, okay, here we go.

19:51.694 --> 19:53.093
Here we go.
Here we go. Oh.

19:53.095 --> 19:55.262
No, no, don't go down.
Yeah, yeah.

19:55.264 --> 19:57.264
Get up.
Let's go!

19:57.266 --> 19:58.899

20:07.076 --> 20:10.611
So you were saying your life
is not like a telenovela?

20:10.613 --> 20:12.913
Maybe a little.

20:12.915 --> 20:14.281

20:14.283 --> 20:17.484

20:20.723 --> 20:22.556
Isn't this great?

20:22.558 --> 20:25.392
When you add up all the set,
it's like I live in a mansion.

20:25.394 --> 20:26.994
Yeah.

20:26.996 --> 20:30.431
Hey, maybe you should write
an episode about that.

20:30.433 --> 20:32.299
Whoa. I don't tell you
how to be pretty.

20:32.301 --> 20:34.568
You don't tell me how to write.

20:36.138 --> 20:39.807
[both laughing]

20:47.650 --> 20:49.683
- Isaac lives here?
- Mm.

20:49.685 --> 20:51.352
Wow! You really
do see everything.

20:51.354 --> 20:53.087
Mmhmm.

20:53.089 --> 20:55.756
What's that?

20:55.758 --> 20:59.360
That's why I don't eat
the deviled eggs.
