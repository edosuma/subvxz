00:14.850 --> 00:15.610
Just stick close.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.210
Nobody's gonna mess with
us if we're in a group.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.650
It's been 3 weeks. I was
the last one to talk to her.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.330
You really think somebody took her?

00:21.800 --> 00:23.230
You guys are being crazy.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.880
Julie wouldn't disappear.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.540
You sure about that?

00:27.550 --> 00:29.870
It's like she vanished,
just like that other girl.

00:29.888 --> 00:31.870
Her mom's a total wreck.

00:32.650 --> 00:33.790
Right.

00:37.132 --> 00:39.589
Everyone around here is losing it.

00:42.379 --> 00:43.458
They're just scared.

00:43.469 --> 00:46.162
Trust me, julie got her ass out of here.

00:46.175 --> 00:49.491
I guarantee you she's probably
in D.C.Or new york right now.

00:53.125 --> 00:53.810
Danny.

00:53.826 --> 00:54.600
Danny?

00:54.618 --> 00:55.632
Oh, my god.

00:56.608 --> 00:57.660
Danny!

00:59.556 --> 01:00.992
Danny?

01:02.807 --> 01:04.251
You're a bastard.

01:06.877 --> 01:08.341
You should have seen your face, man.

01:08.355 --> 01:11.011
That was hilarious.
You were so freaked out.

01:11.126 --> 01:12.313
What?

01:15.535 --> 01:16.612
What?

01:16.627 --> 01:18.080
It wasn't funny, jackass.

01:18.095 --> 01:19.802
Come on, guys.

01:28.977 --> 01:31.062
If you want me drunk
and naked, just say it.

01:31.077 --> 01:33.661
Shouldn't have to try so hard.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.251
Did you hear that?

01:38.265 --> 01:41.051
No way. He doesn't know when to quit.

01:43.075 --> 01:44.520
What are you doing?

01:44.876 --> 01:46.651
I'm gonna go kick his ass.

01:48.987 --> 01:50.190
Hurry back.

01:51.768 --> 01:52.803
Danny...

01:54.428 --> 01:55.781
danny!

01:58.027 --> 01:59.452
Danny!

02:00.697 --> 02:02.783
I swear to god I'm gonna kill you.

02:06.755 --> 02:08.513
I couldn't find him.

02:10.044 --> 02:11.323
Molly?

02:13.658 --> 02:14.543
Molly.

02:16.046 --> 02:16.951
Danny.

02:18.425 --> 02:19.210
Where's molly?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.360
This is too easy, man. She's with you.

02:21.377 --> 02:23.351
No, come on, where's molly, seriously?

02:26.165 --> 02:27.563
She's with you.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.701
Molly!

02:30.957 --> 02:32.171
Molly?

02:33.207 --> 02:34.711
Molly?

02:36.266 --> 02:38.232
Molly?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.770
F.B.I.,Behavioral Analysis
Unit QUANTICO,VIRGINIA

02:42.788 --> 02:45.741
Yeah, I'm about to present
the case to the team.

02:46.755 --> 02:50.423
Oh, no, no, uh, I'm confident
that they'll feel the same way.

02:51.535 --> 02:54.530
Ok. We'll be there as soon as we can.

02:54.545 --> 02:55.720
Thank you.

03:21.366 --> 03:23.203
Uh, everyone's here.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.223
Sorry I'm late.

03:28.235 --> 03:31.953
Last night in fredericksburg, a 20-year-old
woman, molly mccarthy, was abducted.

03:31.965 --> 03:34.100
She's the third to go
missing in the last 6 weeks.

03:34.117 --> 03:35.883
All disappeared from public places.

03:35.895 --> 03:37.263
No one's seen them since.

03:37.277 --> 03:38.713
Until now.

03:38.726 --> 03:42.462
A couple days ago, body parts with cigarette
burns were recovered from a national park

03:42.478 --> 03:45.220
which was once the site of
the battle of chancellorsville.

03:45.237 --> 03:46.591
Were they able to make an I.D.?

03:46.607 --> 03:48.291
It was the first victim,
taken 6 weeks ago.

03:48.307 --> 03:51.602
Decomp indicated that she had
been dead just over a week.

03:51.615 --> 03:53.203
So he likes spending time with them.

03:53.217 --> 03:54.533
How'd she end up like that?

03:54.548 --> 03:56.742
M.E.Found microscopic
tool marks on the bone.

03:56.758 --> 04:00.253
I remember reading about a case
like this in spotsylvania county.

04:00.267 --> 04:01.823
Similar markings on the bone.

04:01.837 --> 04:06.333
It was the winter of 1980, also
fredericksburg. 5 women, 16 to 24.

04:06.345 --> 04:08.432
Buried in pieces. Same markings.

04:08.445 --> 04:09.980
Same civil war battlefield.

04:09.998 --> 04:12.642
Killed the same time of year
and left at the same dump site?

04:12.657 --> 04:14.061
It's like an anniversary.

04:14.078 --> 04:15.310
That case is still open.

04:15.328 --> 04:17.880
Back then the victims were
drug addicts and runaways.

04:17.896 --> 04:19.422
If he spends that much time with them,

04:19.435 --> 04:21.709
there's a chance these 2
women could still be alive.

04:21.726 --> 04:23.761
Wait. We think this
could be the same killer?

04:23.778 --> 04:25.592
That's a hell of a cooling-off period.

04:25.606 --> 04:27.862
Btk resurfaced after a 25-year hiatus.

04:27.878 --> 04:30.440
True, but he didn't kill anyone.
He only taunted the police.

04:30.456 --> 04:34.410
Marks on the bone and where he dumps
them-- that's a very specific signature.

04:34.425 --> 04:37.531
Hard to copycat details
that were never made public.

04:37.548 --> 04:40.481
Garcia, check the M.O.Against
girls missing in other states.

04:40.496 --> 04:41.820
It could explain the long absence.

04:41.836 --> 04:42.712
I'm on it.

04:42.728 --> 04:47.970
If this is the same unsub, what's
he been doing for the past 27 years?

05:15.557 --> 05:16.950
Julie?

05:18.525 --> 05:19.892
Molly.

05:23.987 --> 05:26.730
If you're quiet, you won't get burned.

05:27.126 --> 05:29.662
Trust me. Do what he says.

05:31.788 --> 05:34.162
Go on. Show her.

05:34.706 --> 05:36.060
It's a party.

06:24.605 --> 06:27.232
The american poet
anne sexton once wrote,

06:27.246 --> 06:32.170
"it doesn't matter who my father was,
it matters who i remember he was."

06:33.906 --> 06:37.323
The killer has an obvious
disregard for women.

06:37.335 --> 06:39.433
He sees them as
disposable and worthless.

06:39.445 --> 06:42.061
You know, he'd need a lot of time
and privacy to do this to them.

06:42.078 --> 06:43.600
Seclusion. Time.

06:43.616 --> 06:47.051
Back then, the theory was he was a
seasonal worker on one of the farms.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.601
There's the dump site.

06:51.447 --> 06:55.042
It's funny--he always dumps the bodies in
this battlefield, no matter what the risk.

06:55.057 --> 06:56.951
It's a respected landmark.

06:56.966 --> 06:59.942
He's flaunting. It
makes him feel important.

07:12.678 --> 07:15.472
Does everybody just think I ran away?

07:17.695 --> 07:19.300
No.

07:19.967 --> 07:23.641
It was just me. I was stupid.

07:23.657 --> 07:25.041
You sure?

07:25.517 --> 07:27.093
I promise.

07:28.065 --> 07:30.153
The whole town...

07:30.448 --> 07:32.632
everybody's searching.

07:35.176 --> 07:37.202
My mom and dad?

07:38.186 --> 07:41.643
They would never think that
you just took off like that.

07:44.706 --> 07:47.271
How long have I been here?

07:49.986 --> 07:52.160
3 weeks.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.601
Does he do that every night?

07:56.965 --> 07:59.221
You just have to go
to a different place.

07:59.275 --> 08:01.612
It's the only way to get through it.

08:09.545 --> 08:11.173
Sheriff ballantyne, jennifer jareau.

08:11.187 --> 08:13.072
- Appreciate you all coming down so quickly.
- Aaron hotchner.

08:13.085 --> 08:14.533
This is dr. Spencer reid.

08:14.545 --> 08:16.391
Crime scene's right up here.

08:16.405 --> 08:18.153
I figured if this is the
same killer as before,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.673
I didn't want to waste any
time before I got your help.

08:20.686 --> 08:24.142
The other agents are meeting john caulfield,
the sheriff from the original case.

08:24.157 --> 08:25.152
Yeah.

08:25.166 --> 08:26.420
You know him?

08:26.436 --> 08:29.091
no, not personally, you
know, I just heard stories.

08:29.105 --> 08:30.350
How do you mean?

08:30.558 --> 08:34.039
Well, you know, by all accounts,
he was a decent sheriff, good man.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.011
Right.

08:35.028 --> 08:38.510
Truth is, we don't get a lot of murders
down here, and this case broke him.

08:38.528 --> 08:39.751
How so?

08:39.765 --> 08:43.152
Ah, same old--you know, he started
drinking, marriage busted up.

08:43.164 --> 08:46.211
Finally they, uh, asked him to retire.

08:46.377 --> 08:48.210
Sheriff's Station
FREDERICKSBURG,VIRGINIA

08:48.220 --> 08:50.560
Am I in the right place?

08:51.812 --> 08:52.979
David rossi.

08:52.989 --> 08:54.598
John caulfield.

08:54.609 --> 08:57.120
Agents derek morgan, emily prentiss.

08:57.135 --> 08:59.400
Just going over your old case, sir.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.550
Sharon chroniger.

09:04.827 --> 09:07.281
She was 16 years old.

09:07.295 --> 09:09.943
We found her body in pieces.

09:10.305 --> 09:13.811
I promised her parents that
I would find out who did this.

09:13.828 --> 09:16.622
Then her father passed away.

09:17.887 --> 09:22.202
Tell us what fredericksburg
was like in 1980.

09:22.556 --> 09:25.240
It was a farming community. Rural.

09:25.255 --> 09:26.562
Everybody knew everybody.

09:26.575 --> 09:28.353
You could leave your
doors open at night.

09:28.365 --> 09:30.823
Townhomes and housing
communities are everywhere now.

09:30.835 --> 09:32.822
It could explain the
change in victim type.

09:32.837 --> 09:35.332
Runaways and prostitutes
to college students.

09:35.346 --> 09:36.732
He's taking what's available.

09:36.747 --> 09:39.451
It's not normal for a killer
to stop for 27 years, is it?

09:39.465 --> 09:40.291
No.

09:40.305 --> 09:44.181
But he could have been in prison,
injured, he might have moved away.

09:44.196 --> 09:47.350
He must have found other
ways to satisfy his needs.

09:51.775 --> 09:55.981
There were about 20 kids
partying 100 yards that way.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.570
Molly mccarthy was taken here.

09:57.585 --> 10:01.760
We found a blanket, sweatshirt,
and a pair of shoes over there.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.001
How does someone not see or hea them?

10:04.015 --> 10:06.100
R it was dark. He had the advantage.

10:06.117 --> 10:08.030
Molly's boyfriend was the
last person to see her.

10:08.047 --> 10:10.251
Said she was alone for
a minute, maybe less.

10:10.266 --> 10:11.832
He's patient, works fast.

10:11.846 --> 10:13.382
He's perfected his M.O.

10:13.398 --> 10:18.203
If our unsub's pushing 60, he's gotta be strong
enough to carry her a long way without her struggling.

10:18.216 --> 10:23.482
I've seen a lot of properties on unmarked dirt roads
with no visible street signs, nothing on any maps.

10:23.496 --> 10:26.470
Yeah. If you don't live around here,
it can be hell finding your way around.

10:26.486 --> 10:28.022
He's definitely local.

10:28.036 --> 10:30.252
Can you show us the various
entrances to this place?

10:30.266 --> 10:31.563
Sure.

10:34.227 --> 10:35.771
I'll catch up.

10:43.636 --> 10:47.940
Ever since we had jack, I always dread it
when you bring me a case involving kids.

10:47.955 --> 10:49.861
Why are you telling me this?

10:49.878 --> 10:53.152
Every case we work, every case we
don't work comes across your desk.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.080
Yeah.

10:54.096 --> 10:58.162
And most of the victims are women,
and most of them are about your age.

10:58.986 --> 11:01.820
It's ok if you lose it
every once in a while.

11:01.836 --> 11:04.000
It reminds people that we're human.

11:04.316 --> 11:06.072
You've never lost it.

11:06.587 --> 11:08.563
Maybe I should have.

11:16.557 --> 11:17.801
Promise...

11:18.295 --> 11:19.851
if I die...

11:19.867 --> 11:22.723
you'll never tell my
parents what he did to us.

11:22.737 --> 11:23.811
You're not gonna die.

11:23.827 --> 11:25.213
Man: Quiet!

11:25.965 --> 11:26.853
Promise.

11:26.868 --> 11:28.661
We're gonna get out of here.

11:34.816 --> 11:36.122
Go.

11:36.136 --> 11:38.742
- Julie, get up!
- I said quiet!

11:41.898 --> 11:42.963
do it!

11:43.387 --> 11:45.110
Let me do it!

11:47.126 --> 11:48.601
I'm trying, I swear.

11:48.616 --> 11:50.510
Julie, please.

11:50.526 --> 11:51.412
No!

11:57.285 --> 11:59.751
Julie! I promise!

12:06.575 --> 12:08.923
I got 2 sets of parents
waiting for an I.D.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.322
I can help you with that.

12:10.507 --> 12:11.823
Thanks.

12:12.017 --> 12:13.930
He didn't spread them around this time.

12:14.377 --> 12:15.291
They were in plain sight.

12:15.308 --> 12:16.832
He's taunting us.

12:16.847 --> 12:19.962
He's basically saying, "I'm doing this
and there's nothing you can do to stop me."

12:19.978 --> 12:22.663
Nobody can get in here without
showing their I.D.At the gate.

12:22.678 --> 12:25.172
I have a copy of that visitors
list, but there's a hundred ways in.

12:25.187 --> 12:27.601
These fences back up
to personal properties.

12:27.617 --> 12:29.313
He knows these grounds
as well as anyone.

12:29.327 --> 12:33.241
He could have jumped the fence, disposed
of his victims, and walked right back out.

12:35.605 --> 12:37.681
Let me out of here!

12:38.457 --> 12:41.253
Help! Help!

12:41.857 --> 12:43.741
Help me!

12:47.587 --> 12:49.201
Help!

12:49.307 --> 12:51.373
Let me out of here!

13:01.576 --> 13:03.640
You come to check up on me?

13:04.245 --> 13:05.092
Nope.

13:06.917 --> 13:09.823
Legend around here says I'm crazy.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.183
I'm not big on legends.

13:15.767 --> 13:19.051
I didn't want to think
that someone from here...

13:19.428 --> 13:21.240
could have done this.

13:22.085 --> 13:24.211
You believed in your community.

13:24.225 --> 13:27.063
That was my mistake.

13:27.075 --> 13:29.013
Pretty common one.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.453
I want to show you something.

13:36.707 --> 13:40.181
I carry this wherever I go.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.421
Your kids?

13:44.436 --> 13:47.290
Indianapolis. Christmas eve.

13:48.445 --> 13:51.253
One of my first cases on the job.

13:53.157 --> 13:56.893
3 kids watched their
parents get beaten to death.

13:56.905 --> 14:00.343
Every year I call to tell
them I haven't forgotten.

14:00.355 --> 14:02.562
I'm still looking.

14:04.918 --> 14:06.822
Last year...

14:09.926 --> 14:13.350
not one of them bothered
to return my call.

14:18.717 --> 14:21.631
Come on. We're wasting time.

14:25.305 --> 14:28.873
I've got a list of violations in this
county that precede the 1980 murders.

14:28.885 --> 14:33.003
A dui, petty thefts, rape, assault.
A few of these are repeat offenders.

14:33.316 --> 14:34.431
Garcia's got something.

14:34.447 --> 14:36.192
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

14:36.207 --> 14:39.723
So, I have dug across the whole
country looking for this guy's M.O.

14:39.736 --> 14:41.350
I found a sum total of zilch.

14:41.366 --> 14:43.192
So, I went closer to home.

14:43.206 --> 14:47.522
I found a complaint filed by a
karen foley in the next county over.

14:47.538 --> 14:50.243
The story'S... awful.

14:50.255 --> 14:52.432
I sent a copy to all your hand-helds.

14:52.447 --> 14:57.531
Pg version is that she was
kidnapped in 1979, but then...

14:57.547 --> 14:58.913
she escaped.

14:58.926 --> 15:00.190
I never heard that story.

15:00.206 --> 15:01.890
It wasn't your jurisdiction.

15:01.906 --> 15:04.072
What if she was his first?

15:04.088 --> 15:05.732
Like his dress rehearsal.

15:05.746 --> 15:08.330
Figured out who and where to hunt
and learned what worked, what didn'T.

15:08.348 --> 15:11.332
Maybe careful planning has
always been a part of his process.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.481
Where is she now?

15:12.498 --> 15:14.503
Baby girl, wk oryour magic
and find us an address.

15:14.518 --> 15:15.980
I'm on it.

15:22.618 --> 15:24.780
Ms. Foley? Hello.

15:24.796 --> 15:27.732
I'm emily prentiss, this is
derek morgan. We're from the fbi.

15:27.746 --> 15:29.482
Do you have a minute?

15:29.836 --> 15:30.992
Fbi?

15:31.005 --> 15:34.761
We're investigating the murders of 2 women
and the abduction of a third in fredericksburg.

15:34.778 --> 15:36.693
Maybe you read about it?

15:36.708 --> 15:38.542
Yes. It's awful.

15:38.558 --> 15:42.162
Ma'am, we think it may be related
to what happened to you in 1979.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.801
Your abduction.

15:45.136 --> 15:47.370
I'm sorry, you're mistaken.

15:48.037 --> 15:50.450
Why would you say that?
You sound pretty certain.

15:50.468 --> 15:53.162
I am. I made it up.

15:54.198 --> 15:56.472
We've read your report.

15:56.486 --> 16:01.002
You were drugged, burned,
beaten, sexually assaulted.

16:01.018 --> 16:02.122
You were held against your will.

16:02.136 --> 16:03.342
I was 17.

16:03.358 --> 16:06.561
I had to have some kind of
excuse for where I'd been.

16:06.576 --> 16:07.720
Where had you been?

16:07.736 --> 16:10.912
Around. I was using back then.

16:16.306 --> 16:18.292
You called home, ma'am.

16:18.308 --> 16:21.353
Some offenders force their victims to
contact families to explain their whereabouts.

16:21.366 --> 16:23.263
There was no offender.

16:24.095 --> 16:28.211
A lot of the details in your report are consistent
with what happened to those women in 1980.

16:28.225 --> 16:30.490
You calling me a liar?

16:30.868 --> 16:34.363
We understand if you're trying to
protect yourself from that memory,

16:34.378 --> 16:38.663
but right now you're the only
person alive who can help us.

16:38.678 --> 16:41.103
No other women have to suffer.

16:41.118 --> 16:44.361
Whatever did happen, you survived it.

16:45.517 --> 16:48.852
Please... when you're ready to talk...

16:49.366 --> 16:52.513
I'm not a lead. I'm sorry.

16:52.525 --> 16:55.343
I hope you find whoever's doing this.

17:04.807 --> 17:06.982
Karen foley recanted her story.

17:06.998 --> 17:08.569
Do you think she's lying?

17:08.586 --> 17:10.153
Well, something happened to her.

17:10.166 --> 17:13.271
She avoided eye contact, shielded
herself, she got very defensive.

17:13.288 --> 17:15.642
Just refused to admit it happened.

17:15.657 --> 17:18.349
She couldn't open that door.
Afraid she could never come back.

17:18.367 --> 17:20.770
Right now the only person she's
protecting is the offender.

17:20.787 --> 17:23.512
We just told her that this
guy could still be out there.

17:23.525 --> 17:25.210
She wasn't even concerned.

17:25.224 --> 17:27.393
She wasn't scared at all. Why?

17:27.407 --> 17:29.320
Maybe she's got nothing to be afraid of.

17:29.335 --> 17:31.303
Where are you going with this?

17:31.685 --> 17:33.812
Why can't someone let a case go?

17:33.825 --> 17:37.282
Because in your gut you know the
son of a bitch is still out there.

17:37.295 --> 17:40.381
Exactly. Only she doesn't blink.

17:42.657 --> 17:45.623
She'd only move back here
because she thought it was safe.

17:45.638 --> 17:49.202
So the guy who actually did this
to her either moved away or he died.

17:49.218 --> 17:51.273
You know who this man is.

17:51.288 --> 17:52.791
He grew up here, too.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.771
He was in his mid-20s back then.

17:54.788 --> 17:57.850
He left after you found his last victim.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.891
December 13, 1980.

17:59.908 --> 18:01.293
He might have gone to prison.

18:01.306 --> 18:04.221
Could have joined the military,
moved away, sold his property.

18:04.237 --> 18:06.621
He was reckless in his
personal life, a drinker.

18:06.635 --> 18:08.201
He would have had arrests for dui.

18:08.215 --> 18:10.673
This is it. This is
your case, right here.

18:10.685 --> 18:16.031
He was meticulous, so he--he may have
had 2 areas of control, both private.

18:16.048 --> 18:17.820
One to torture and one to confine them.

18:17.836 --> 18:19.053
A workshop, maybe.

18:19.066 --> 18:20.421
A barn, a garage, even.

18:20.436 --> 18:23.601
December 1980-- the man was
here and then he was gone.

18:23.618 --> 18:25.340
You know him, john.

18:25.357 --> 18:27.800
Robert wilkinson.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.841
3 duis. Spent a few days in jail.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.121
Well, he's dead. He
was 28 when it happened.

18:32.136 --> 18:33.843
He fell into his combine harvester.

18:33.858 --> 18:36.110
- When was this?
- December 1980.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.422
Right when the killings stopped.

18:37.436 --> 18:39.620
Karen foley moved back soon after that.

18:39.636 --> 18:41.270
Was he survived by anyone?

18:41.288 --> 18:42.902
A widow.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.000
Sheriff caulfield.

18:54.018 --> 18:55.520
Hello, mary.

18:55.536 --> 18:57.132
May we come in?

19:06.886 --> 19:08.531
How you been?

19:08.888 --> 19:09.882
And your son?

19:09.898 --> 19:12.260
He's married now, doing just fine.

19:13.155 --> 19:16.172
I know you didn't make a house
call to see how I'm doing.

19:16.806 --> 19:21.702
We're investigating a case,
and it's lead us to robert.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.550
Well, he's been dead for 27
years. What could he have done?

19:26.565 --> 19:29.701
Murdered 5 women in 1980.

19:30.888 --> 19:33.540
I'm sure you remember.

19:35.068 --> 19:38.092
I'm sorry. I haven't thought
about him for a long time.

19:38.107 --> 19:42.142
You were a young widow, and the sheriff
said you had to raise your son by yourself.

19:42.156 --> 19:46.130
It's hard to believe you wouldn't
think about him from time to time.

19:46.148 --> 19:48.551
I've never felt sorry for myself.

19:48.966 --> 19:51.690
Most women who are widowed young
consider themselves victims.

19:51.708 --> 19:52.802
I moved on.

19:52.818 --> 19:54.172
You remarried?

19:54.186 --> 19:55.712
I moved back here with my parents.

19:55.725 --> 19:57.731
Stayed here for a bit
while I was pregnant.

19:57.748 --> 19:59.610
Robert was mean when he drank.

19:59.628 --> 20:01.452
He begged me to come home.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.983
Said he'd changed.

20:02.996 --> 20:04.300
Did he?

20:04.318 --> 20:05.801
I don't know.

20:05.817 --> 20:08.303
He died the day I went back.

20:10.338 --> 20:12.581
She doesn't seem too upset.

20:12.597 --> 20:14.263
She wasn't surprised.

20:14.277 --> 20:16.921
She didn't even ask why
we thought he did it.

20:16.935 --> 20:18.473
She suspected him.

20:18.486 --> 20:21.040
He was a drunk. She got
pregnant and left him.

20:21.057 --> 20:22.471
Abandonment.

20:22.485 --> 20:24.640
Might have had the same
thing with his mother.

20:24.655 --> 20:26.231
Either way, he can't handle it.

20:26.247 --> 20:28.400
It's his stressor. He starts killing.

20:28.415 --> 20:29.841
Madonna/whorore complex.

20:29.857 --> 20:32.813
He couldn't touch his pure wife,
so he had to find disposable girls.

20:32.825 --> 20:35.491
But the killing stopped when he died.

20:35.505 --> 20:37.523
So who's doing it now?

20:49.745 --> 20:51.293
mr. Parker?

20:52.707 --> 20:53.910
You still here?

20:54.755 --> 20:56.000
BACK IN 5 MINUTES

20:56.015 --> 20:57.370
My god.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.382
There's been another abduction.

21:27.395 --> 21:28.691
Name's tara ricker.

21:28.708 --> 21:29.862
Family called this morning.

21:29.876 --> 21:31.300
She didn't come home last night.

21:31.318 --> 21:33.340
We're still trying
to locate the vehicle.

21:33.356 --> 21:36.281
Well, we know he kills after he takes another
victim, so we're running out of time here.

21:36.298 --> 21:37.390
All right, what do we know?

21:37.408 --> 21:40.370
Definitely a copycat.
Same M.O., Same dump site.

21:40.387 --> 21:42.963
- Only you never released any of that to the press.
- No.

21:42.976 --> 21:46.381
He had to learn it from someone--
a family member, a friend maybe?

21:46.398 --> 21:48.411
Mary and robert wilkinson had a son.

21:48.426 --> 21:51.931
Are you suggesting there is a
genetic predisposition to killing?

21:51.947 --> 21:54.983
It's one factor, along with
psychology and socialization.

21:54.995 --> 21:59.681
If you have a combination of genetics and a son who
grew up without a father searching for his own identity,

21:59.695 --> 22:00.703
it could be a stressor.

22:00.715 --> 22:03.731
I remember charlie wilkinson, when
he was 15, killed a neighbor's cat.

22:03.746 --> 22:07.223
He put it in a bag and
hit it against a tree.

22:07.636 --> 22:08.972
How old is charlie wilkinson?

22:08.987 --> 22:10.773
Mary was pregnant with
him when robert died.

22:10.788 --> 22:11.790
That's 27 years ago.

22:11.806 --> 22:14.973
That makes him roughly the same age
robert was when he started killing.

22:18.077 --> 22:19.293
What do you got for us, girl?

22:19.305 --> 22:21.900
I just found the reason
why karen foley was lying.

22:26.506 --> 22:27.770
What are you doing back here?

22:27.788 --> 22:30.652
I told you before, I
don't know anything.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.093
We know that he burned you, ms. Foley.

22:33.105 --> 22:35.723
All of the other victims had them, too.

22:37.035 --> 22:39.550
We know that you were
raped by robert wilkinson,

22:39.565 --> 22:42.522
and we know that you
have a son because of it.

22:44.807 --> 22:47.532
There was another girl here?

22:51.976 --> 22:54.021
Listen to me.

22:54.036 --> 22:58.431
Her name... was julie stanton.

22:59.128 --> 23:03.080
I promised that her parents would
never know what he did to us.

23:04.645 --> 23:06.613
Why are you telling me?

23:06.627 --> 23:10.623
Because... because he's
gonna kill me first.

23:18.026 --> 23:21.132
Stephen doesn't know the truth. So...

23:21.146 --> 23:23.613
you never told him about his father?

23:23.965 --> 23:26.402
I made him out to be a hero.

23:26.418 --> 23:29.380
Said he died in a
motorcycle accident, so...

23:29.397 --> 23:33.311
why did you decide to have the child?

23:33.328 --> 23:37.551
I... I couldn'T...

23:37.568 --> 23:41.053
make my baby pay for
what his father did.

23:42.418 --> 23:44.952
Is stephen drinking again?

23:45.795 --> 23:47.463
Yes.

23:47.476 --> 23:50.240
He just got out of jail for a dui.

23:50.255 --> 23:54.551
Has he been hostile or gone
for long periods of time?

23:54.566 --> 23:56.663
Why are you asking me these questions?

23:56.675 --> 24:01.021
You lied about your past because
you're protecting your son.

24:04.015 --> 24:07.491
You're scared that he could be
hurting these women, aren't you?

24:09.528 --> 24:12.773
We need to talk to him, ms. Foley.

24:17.155 --> 24:18.343
The car's clean.

24:18.355 --> 24:19.813
We're dusting it for prints.

24:19.828 --> 24:20.920
How long has it been here?

24:20.936 --> 24:22.872
Owner said since last night.

24:23.146 --> 24:25.530
How the hell do you not
find that suspicious?

24:25.757 --> 24:27.163
He's back and forth from the farm.

24:27.176 --> 24:30.280
Says he didn't pay much attention
till he heard tara ricker was missing.

24:30.296 --> 24:31.401
You talk to any customers?

24:31.417 --> 24:33.281
No one remembers seeing tara.

24:33.298 --> 24:37.422
4 girls are missing and someone
doesn't notice an abandoned car.

24:38.386 --> 24:40.212
Yeah, what's up, reid?

24:41.176 --> 24:42.452
Got it.

24:43.346 --> 24:45.200
Charlie wilkinson didn't
show up for work today.

24:45.215 --> 24:47.041
Let's go see if he's home.

24:50.046 --> 24:51.523
Stephen?

24:52.896 --> 24:54.453
Mom?

24:56.185 --> 24:58.171
I knew something was wrong.

24:58.185 --> 25:01.240
David rossi and emily prentiss, fbi.

25:01.255 --> 25:05.102
We're investigating the disappearance
of 4 women from this area.

25:05.118 --> 25:08.080
Yeah. A girl over at the
monroe farm.I heard about that.

25:08.097 --> 25:10.533
Do you know something about that?

25:11.035 --> 25:12.561
I don't know anything.

25:12.577 --> 25:15.981
Does the name robert
wilkinson mean anything to you?

25:15.998 --> 25:17.620
Please don'T.

25:18.845 --> 25:20.963
No, it's ok.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.313
Is this about what he did to my mom?

25:26.327 --> 25:28.193
What are you talking about?

25:28.205 --> 25:30.832
You thought you could keep it a secret?

25:33.357 --> 25:35.843
- I've known for a long time.
- What?

25:37.157 --> 25:40.021
That robert wilkinson raped you.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.251
Why are you saying that?

25:42.268 --> 25:45.022
You never got married. You never dated.

25:45.037 --> 25:47.890
You cried yourself to sleep every night.

25:48.665 --> 25:51.451
I knew someone hurt you.

25:52.055 --> 25:53.691
Real bad.

25:53.705 --> 25:57.583
And then one day i was cleaning out
the garage and I found that article...

25:58.105 --> 26:00.963
about the man who died
in the farming accident...

26:00.978 --> 26:03.290
robert wilkinson.

26:04.066 --> 26:06.230
There was a picture of him.

26:08.106 --> 26:12.910
And another article about women
disappearing, being found dead.

26:15.606 --> 26:18.230
And, uh... just...

26:19.206 --> 26:24.040
when you walked in the door and saw me holding
that picture, the way you looked at me...

26:25.537 --> 26:27.261
I knew.

26:27.477 --> 26:30.533
But... that was 10 years ago.

26:30.545 --> 26:33.311
You knew I made it all up?

26:35.077 --> 26:36.601
You knew?

26:36.615 --> 26:38.241
They were really great stories.

26:38.256 --> 26:39.762
Honey...

26:40.688 --> 26:44.462
I wanted you to believe
he was a good man.

26:46.445 --> 26:49.272
You're the only good
thing that came out of it.

26:52.475 --> 26:56.183
So, what, you think this old case
is connected to the new murders?

26:56.197 --> 26:57.991
Yes, we do.

26:59.125 --> 27:02.043
But wilkinson's dead.

27:05.358 --> 27:08.070
And I'm not.

27:14.286 --> 27:16.960
Mom...

27:17.525 --> 27:19.970
you think I did this?

27:24.765 --> 27:28.042
If you thought that I could turn
out like him, why would you--

27:28.056 --> 27:30.091
why would you ever even have me?

27:30.107 --> 27:33.340
I never regretted
my decision--never.

27:34.746 --> 27:37.402
I'm sorry, stephen.

27:37.916 --> 27:40.802
I don't want to doubt you.

27:42.185 --> 27:44.542
I didn't kill anybody.

27:52.877 --> 27:53.732
Yeah, rossi.

27:53.747 --> 27:54.712
What's going on?

27:54.726 --> 27:57.781
Morgan and reid went to find charlie
wilkinson at work. He wasn't there.

27:57.796 --> 28:00.603
Well, we can't rule out
stephen foley just yet.

28:00.616 --> 28:02.680
We're on our way to
the wilkinson house now.

28:02.695 --> 28:04.690
Let us know what you find.

28:06.756 --> 28:09.570
Can you tell us what he did to you?

28:11.948 --> 28:13.930
I'll try.

28:21.795 --> 28:25.212
I remember the first time
he took me to the barn.

28:27.265 --> 28:31.393
He would cover my head so
I didn't know where I was.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.092
But it didn't really matter.

28:34.105 --> 28:37.171
He kept me so high, I
didn't know what day it was.

28:38.188 --> 28:40.952
He wanted me to dance for him.

28:41.948 --> 28:44.650
He would call it a party.

28:49.706 --> 28:52.622
One night he was so passed out that...

28:52.635 --> 28:56.633
I realized that the barn door was
unlocked and my cuffs were undone,

28:56.648 --> 28:59.481
so I was able to get away.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.143
The cops didn't believe your story?

29:06.198 --> 29:09.000
They just thought I was a junkie.

29:13.448 --> 29:16.610
It was... humiliating.

29:16.626 --> 29:19.031
Did you see any other girls there?

29:19.045 --> 29:20.443
I was the only one.

29:20.457 --> 29:23.693
U n yocaremember any details
about your surroundings?

29:23.705 --> 29:26.113
Nothing is too small.

29:30.347 --> 29:33.681
I scratched a little
peace symbol on the wall.

29:33.696 --> 29:37.710
I would touch it every night
before he came... for me.

29:40.547 --> 29:43.491
That was my guardian angel.

29:47.017 --> 29:48.210
Chrissy wilkinson?

29:48.225 --> 29:49.581
Can I help you?

29:49.596 --> 29:52.113
Jennifer jareau, this is derek
morgan. We're with the fbi.

29:52.127 --> 29:52.921
Fbi?

29:52.936 --> 29:55.722
We're looking for charles
wilkinson. Is he here?

29:55.735 --> 29:56.642
Uh, he's at work.

29:56.657 --> 29:59.652
He's not there. Do you mind
if we take a look around?

30:00.095 --> 30:01.901
I don't understand. What's this about?

30:01.918 --> 30:04.670
We're investigating the
murders of some local women.

30:05.836 --> 30:07.571
And you're looking for charlie?

30:07.588 --> 30:10.663
Ma'am, we could go get a
warrant if we needed to.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.261
Ma'am?

30:15.547 --> 30:16.631
Let's go.

30:49.188 --> 30:50.450
Reid.

31:08.267 --> 31:12.241
obviously this is where he's been
torturing them, but where's he keeping them?

31:12.638 --> 31:13.830
Somewhere isolated.

31:13.848 --> 31:15.890
He can't risk storing
them close to his house.

31:18.765 --> 31:19.831
Do you know this property?

31:19.848 --> 31:24.132
I... only had contact
with robert in town.

31:30.875 --> 31:32.511
Ms. Wilkinson?

31:33.636 --> 31:35.190
Excuse us.

31:35.528 --> 31:37.281
Chrissy called. What's going on?

31:37.297 --> 31:38.841
We're looking for charlie.

31:40.158 --> 31:42.332
Don't you want to know why?

31:42.348 --> 31:46.553
You knew charlie was an angry kid, made
excuses when he killed the neighbor's cat.

31:46.568 --> 31:48.221
You saw the path he was going down.

31:48.236 --> 31:50.401
It's why you moved away from this place.

31:50.416 --> 31:52.412
You knew what happened here.

31:52.427 --> 31:53.081
No, that's not true.

31:53.095 --> 31:55.463
You were afraid of
the stock he came from.

31:55.475 --> 31:58.593
You thought if you just took
him away from is father's home,

31:58.608 --> 32:02.362
you kept it all a big secret,
then everything would be ok.

32:02.376 --> 32:03.393
I protected him.

32:03.405 --> 32:06.353
Problem is, boy like
charlie, with so much anger,

32:06.366 --> 32:09.643
so many questions, needs
to know where he came from.

32:09.657 --> 32:11.540
He wouldn't quit until he knew.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.961
And then one day, he figured it out.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.471
It was over, john.

32:23.487 --> 32:26.233
You didn't have to worry about
any other girls getting hurt.

32:26.248 --> 32:31.320
And I did not want me son to have the
legacy that his father was a murderer.

32:31.336 --> 32:33.443
Where's charlie now?

32:33.458 --> 32:35.551
I don't know.

32:35.567 --> 32:38.202
Honest. Honest, I don'T.

32:40.277 --> 32:41.730
Where does charlie go to be alone?

32:41.745 --> 32:43.540
- The barn.
- Where else?

32:44.395 --> 32:46.681
god, I don't--I
don't know.

32:47.168 --> 32:49.752
Hey, hotch. We got something.

32:51.075 --> 32:52.422
This was all locked in the closet.

32:52.437 --> 32:55.863
Looks like it was robert wilkinson's
before charlie got his hands on it.

32:55.878 --> 32:58.930
So charlie went looking for a father
figure and this is who he found.

32:58.945 --> 32:59.933
He was killing animals.

32:59.946 --> 33:02.702
It's clear he already has
murderous impulses, and...

33:02.716 --> 33:04.970
finding this must have
made him feel like it was...

33:04.985 --> 33:06.850
ok, like it was almost his birthright.

33:06.866 --> 33:08.671
"They like it when
they get to share me."

33:08.687 --> 33:11.102
Is there anything in there
about where he keeps them?

33:11.116 --> 33:13.022
- Nothing yet.
- Keep reading.

33:15.966 --> 33:17.520
There's no peace sign in here.

33:17.916 --> 33:19.632
It must be where he held them.

33:19.975 --> 33:22.292
Karen foley said he'd
make her walk outside.

33:22.307 --> 33:24.761
You think she can handle
coming back to this place?

33:25.215 --> 33:26.973
I don't know. You saw her.

33:26.987 --> 33:29.591
She's buried this thing for 27 years.

33:30.665 --> 33:33.013
Do we have a choice?

33:33.246 --> 33:34.863
Thank you for coming.

33:34.878 --> 33:36.501
We all know this can't be easy for you.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.781
She's been shaking the whole way here.

33:39.185 --> 33:42.521
You survived this once
and it made you stronger.

33:42.876 --> 33:45.052
You can do this, mom.

33:57.247 --> 33:58.960
- Oh, god.
- Are you ok?

34:00.186 --> 34:02.522
That smell was a part of me.

34:04.858 --> 34:06.370
Who's that?

34:07.035 --> 34:09.011
That's mary wilkinson.

34:09.025 --> 34:10.483
The wife?

34:11.574 --> 34:15.820
He tortured me every single
night. Could you hear my screams?

34:16.226 --> 34:18.860
Did you kiss him when
he was finished with me?

34:18.876 --> 34:20.172
Please, please, don't
do this to yourself.

34:20.186 --> 34:23.732
What did she think he was
doing in that barn every night?

34:23.746 --> 34:24.730
Did you ask?

34:24.746 --> 34:27.830
Did you ask why he wanted
to be away frorom you?

34:28.106 --> 34:32.199
Why? Why didn't you stop him?

34:32.275 --> 34:33.909
Why didn't you help?

34:33.926 --> 34:35.812
I killed him!

34:36.965 --> 34:38.210
What?

34:38.516 --> 34:40.351
Before charlie was born.

34:44.867 --> 34:49.741
I came home, and I saw this
place, and I knew what he had done.

34:50.886 --> 34:56.969
And I couldn't let my innocent
baby be brought into this.

34:59.526 --> 35:01.051
You ki...

35:10.767 --> 35:11.653
thank you.

35:12.145 --> 35:13.591
Hey, sheriff?

35:13.607 --> 35:15.492
I need to rest for a little bit.

35:15.508 --> 35:17.742
Will you be here when
charlie comes home?

35:17.758 --> 35:20.423
Oh, yeah, don't worry. Get your rest.

35:29.198 --> 35:30.480
I...

35:31.227 --> 35:32.832
I don't know where he'd take me.

35:32.847 --> 35:36.181
He always had that bag over my head.

35:36.195 --> 35:38.591
Your other senses could
have been in overdrive.

35:38.605 --> 35:40.560
We're gonna walk you through.

35:41.476 --> 35:44.121
What did the ground feel like?

35:45.417 --> 35:48.193
Close your eyes. Take a few steps.

35:59.378 --> 36:01.051
Leaves and twigs.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.963
It was a long walk.

36:04.608 --> 36:06.533
There was a hill.

36:06.546 --> 36:08.003
I stumbled.

36:08.018 --> 36:11.812
There's something soft and cold,

36:11.825 --> 36:14.651
but it--it's covering
something hard.

36:14.668 --> 36:17.032
Like wood?

36:18.488 --> 36:20.340
Rocks.

36:20.355 --> 36:22.161
Taller than me.

36:22.606 --> 36:24.852
Along the north side of the property.

36:24.865 --> 36:27.130
Hotch. I think we got something.

36:28.426 --> 36:29.890
Thank you.

36:30.928 --> 36:32.452
Did I help?

36:32.465 --> 36:33.792
Yes.

36:46.716 --> 36:49.121
Yeah, I see it. Careful, morgan.

36:51.607 --> 36:52.923
I got it.

37:09.845 --> 37:10.772
Hello?

37:11.217 --> 37:13.242
- Help us!We're in here, please!
- Clear!

37:13.257 --> 37:14.713
Oh, my god.

37:14.725 --> 37:16.240
Ma'am, you ok?

37:16.256 --> 37:17.692
She just passed out.

37:17.708 --> 37:19.792
- Get an ambulance!
- Right now, paramedics!

37:19.807 --> 37:21.323
Ma'am? Sheriff!

37:22.217 --> 37:23.783
She's got a pulse, but she's out.

37:23.797 --> 37:25.951
Where the hell's charlie?

37:37.917 --> 37:38.830
Mary.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.882
Where would charlie go?

37:41.457 --> 37:42.362
I don't know.

37:42.377 --> 37:44.071
What about your husband?

37:44.598 --> 37:46.500
Well, there's a place on the
battlefield.It's over the ridge.

37:46.517 --> 37:48.103
Can you show us?

37:54.917 --> 37:56.492
Charlie.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.632
You know better than to bother me here.

38:00.966 --> 38:02.952
The fbi's at the farm.

38:03.207 --> 38:06.342
They went into the barn and
they found a lot of blood.

38:06.638 --> 38:09.593
The sheriff says you killed
those girls who have been missing.

38:09.608 --> 38:12.190
They have pictures and
books and everything.

38:13.005 --> 38:15.691
That's why you'd stay
in the barn all night?

38:15.986 --> 38:19.383
What did you do to
them, charlie? Did you...

38:19.675 --> 38:21.693
did you rape them?

38:23.377 --> 38:25.762
We're starting a family!

38:25.776 --> 38:26.922
I never wanted that.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.783
You are a liar.

38:28.797 --> 38:32.810
And a sick son of a bitch,
just like your daddy was.

38:53.496 --> 38:55.003
He's gone.

38:56.265 --> 38:58.361
He came at me.

39:00.937 --> 39:03.443
I had to do it.

39:19.278 --> 39:20.703
You ok?

39:23.295 --> 39:25.442
If you stop caring, you're jaded.

39:25.457 --> 39:29.112
If you care too much... it'll ruin you.

39:30.317 --> 39:32.952
Just know that you did
everything you could.

39:33.568 --> 39:36.491
Sometimes we get it right with a little
luck, and most of the times we don'T.

39:36.506 --> 39:39.203
That's the job. It's never perfect.

39:39.915 --> 39:42.112
It's still better to care.

39:42.907 --> 39:44.941
You really believe that?

39:46.995 --> 39:49.613
I believe it's never perfect.

39:56.388 --> 39:58.173
You'd think I'd feel better.

39:59.948 --> 40:03.110
you know, these last
killings weren't your fault.

40:03.428 --> 40:04.721
Yeah.

40:05.446 --> 40:08.051
You couldn't have solved that case.

40:08.065 --> 40:09.713
Your killer was dead.

40:09.727 --> 40:11.761
Not to me.

40:12.127 --> 40:14.041
27 years.

40:15.138 --> 40:17.323
how long has it been for you?

40:21.798 --> 40:24.081
Don't let it get to 22.

40:29.726 --> 40:34.472

40:36.098 --> 40:37.250
Thank you.
