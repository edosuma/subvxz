WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:06.112
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ Okay.

00:06.178 --> 00:07.949
[laughing]

00:08.016 --> 00:09.451
Oh, not in your apartment.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.155
Oh, we actually got
away with it.

00:11.222 --> 00:13.292
Yeah, pretty amazing,
considering half the night

00:13.359 --> 00:14.896
you were screaming
like a banshee.

00:14.963 --> 00:15.898
Hah!

00:17.334 --> 00:19.573
So? You were the one
cooing like a pigeon.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.777
‐ Oh.
‐ Even after you fell asleep.

00:21.844 --> 00:22.979
Yeah, well, you know.

00:23.046 --> 00:25.450
You are the only woman
who has ever elicited

00:25.517 --> 00:27.054
coos from a Barker.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.056
‐ Ooh.
‐ Rrr.

00:28.122 --> 00:30.795
‐ Oh!
‐ Woo.

00:30.862 --> 00:32.064
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Max, Max.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.334
Max, Max, Max, Max.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.138
It's okay.
It's just Overton.

00:36.205 --> 00:37.809
What do you mean,
it's just Overton?

00:37.876 --> 00:40.280
Well, he knows.

00:40.346 --> 00:41.584
He knows what?

00:41.650 --> 00:44.054
I know you'll need
to oil that box spring.

00:46.192 --> 00:49.464
Freaka‐fregade‐fregade
‐fradgady‐freak.

00:49.532 --> 00:51.202
First, Khadijah.
Now, Overton.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.706
Wait, wait, wait.
Khadijah knows?

00:52.772 --> 00:55.010
She knows if she tells,
I'll kill her.

00:57.347 --> 01:00.493
And the same goes
for you, Mr. Handy Boy.

01:01.864 --> 01:03.399
Oh, my lip's are sealed.

01:03.466 --> 01:05.436
Unlike yours,
Miss Pigeon Noises.

01:08.744 --> 01:09.779
‐ That was Kyle.
‐ Oh, yeah.

01:11.048 --> 01:12.986
Yeah, right. Like that
was you doing that.

01:13.052 --> 01:15.557
Ah, she's right man.
You know, she hit that spot‐‐

01:15.625 --> 01:17.294
Oh, no. No, you went

01:17.360 --> 01:18.362
[cooing]

01:18.429 --> 01:19.398
Stop it.

01:19.464 --> 01:22.404
[laughing]

01:22.470 --> 01:23.941
What's so funny?

01:24.008 --> 01:26.245
‐ Ah, nothing.
‐ Ah, nothing.

01:29.151 --> 01:30.922
Overton Wakefield Jones.

01:30.988 --> 01:32.257
Your eyelid twitches that way

01:32.324 --> 01:34.061
when you're holding
something back or telling a lie.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.496
What's going on?

01:35.564 --> 01:37.400
Oh, woman, can't a man
moisten his cornea

01:37.467 --> 01:38.704
without you getting suspicious?

01:38.771 --> 01:41.008
I'm telling you,
n‐nothing's going on.

01:43.012 --> 01:44.515
Alright, tell me you like

01:44.582 --> 01:46.720
my cottage cheese
key lime cobbler.

01:47.856 --> 01:49.424

02:29.512 --> 02:31.415
So why don't you
just give me your number?

02:31.482 --> 02:33.520
And the, I'll have her call you.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.723
Alright, let me get a pen.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.062
Yeah, go ahead.

02:39.331 --> 02:40.702
Uh‐huh.

02:40.768 --> 02:43.039
Okay, alright. Got it. Bye.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.345
So is your dad coming
to the wedding?

02:46.412 --> 02:48.784
Unfortunately,
he's in town early

02:48.851 --> 02:49.953
and he wants
to take me and my mom

02:50.020 --> 02:51.623
to brunch for Mother's Day.

02:51.690 --> 02:53.026
I love brunch.

02:53.092 --> 02:55.196
It's like breakfast and lunch
all rolled up into one.

02:55.263 --> 02:57.334
Oh, oh, that's it.

02:58.670 --> 02:59.806
Breakfast and lunch to..

02:59.873 --> 03:01.382
I just got that, girl.

03:03.888 --> 03:06.192
I don't know why you even
invited him in the first place.

03:06.258 --> 03:08.296
The man just went through
his third divorce.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.935
Think he'd be sick
of weddings by now.

03:11.002 --> 03:14.976
Oh, now, let's put a Band‐Aid
on that emotional boo‐boo.

03:16.312 --> 03:18.049
You know,
your father's kinda cool.

03:18.116 --> 03:19.652
He taught us
how to play basketball

03:19.720 --> 03:21.990
and he taught us that
really neat card game.

03:22.057 --> 03:24.461
Ah, what was it, uh,
three‐card Monte?

03:26.633 --> 03:28.336
Claire, the man spent
more time in Atlantic City

03:28.402 --> 03:30.240
than he did with us.

03:30.306 --> 03:31.877
Maybe he liked the ocean.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.785
Maybe he liked any place
that wasn't home.

03:35.852 --> 03:37.120
Alright, Khadijah.

03:37.187 --> 03:39.559
I know that your father
was not the perfect father.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.864
But‐but maybe my wedding
is the perfect opportunity

03:41.930 --> 03:44.201
for you two to get together
and chit and chat.

03:47.007 --> 03:49.478
‐ Chit and chat?
‐ 'Yeah.'

03:49.545 --> 03:51.516
Well, what we going
to chit and chat about?

03:52.752 --> 03:54.589
Why I only see him
once a year?

03:54.655 --> 03:57.260
Or how are your other kids?

03:57.327 --> 03:59.264
Where is that dirt bike
you promised me

03:59.331 --> 04:00.607
for my tenth birthday?

04:01.810 --> 04:03.580
Huh, where is it?

04:03.647 --> 04:04.883
Where is the bike?

04:04.950 --> 04:06.586
‐ I never got the bike.
‐ I know.

04:06.653 --> 04:07.922
‐ The bike never came.
‐ Ding‐ding‐ding.

04:07.989 --> 04:08.958
‐ Ding‐ding‐ding.
‐ I really wanted that bike.

04:09.024 --> 04:10.460
Ding‐ding‐ding.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.868
Alright, I tried. You win.

04:13.934 --> 04:16.238
Happy cousin, zero.
Stank attitude cousin, one.

04:17.575 --> 04:19.644
Here, have a refreshing drink.
I'm sorry.

04:27.327 --> 04:28.730
Hey, sweetie, um..

04:28.798 --> 04:29.800
The baker is having a problem

04:29.866 --> 04:31.102
with your wedding cake.

04:31.168 --> 04:33.807
Now, he say's that he can
make it in the shape of a daisy

04:33.874 --> 04:36.445
but it's too heavy
to balance on a liquorice stem.

04:37.714 --> 04:39.251
<i>El chorro.</i>

04:39.317 --> 04:40.754
Hey, wait a minute.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.090
Is this one your trick's to keep

04:42.157 --> 04:45.631
my, my‐my reception
from being "an atrocity?"

04:45.697 --> 04:47.367
You know, I get
the feeling you think

04:47.434 --> 04:49.840
this event is all
about you and Overton.

04:49.906 --> 04:53.146
Other people have
reputations at stake here.

04:53.212 --> 04:55.784
Yeah, you're right, Regine.
We're bad people.

04:56.887 --> 04:58.790
[gasps]
Just throw this out.

04:58.858 --> 05:01.703
Did it ever occur to you
that Overton doesn't want

05:01.769 --> 05:04.374
a wedding cake shaped
like a big old funky daisy?

05:05.777 --> 05:09.719
Wait, now. Maybe that's what
he and Kyle are keeping from me.

05:09.785 --> 05:11.055
Overton keeping
secret's from you?

05:11.122 --> 05:12.859
Please girl,
that's like Snap and Crackle

05:12.926 --> 05:14.228
keeping secrets from Pop.

05:16.298 --> 05:18.269
‐ Yeah, it's no big whoop.
‐ Yeah, you're right.

05:18.336 --> 05:21.075
Okay, so this cake.
Now, we've got this‐‐

05:21.142 --> 05:24.715
I bet it's some little thing
wrong with his car.

05:24.782 --> 05:25.952
Something little like that.

05:26.018 --> 05:28.523
Synclaire,
why don't you just ask him?

05:28.590 --> 05:30.026
I don't want to ask him.
I don't want him to think

05:30.093 --> 05:31.629
I don't trust him.

05:31.696 --> 05:34.468
Especially this close
to the wedding.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.874
I mean, i‐it's a bad sign.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.810
You know what's a bad
sign at a wedding?

05:38.878 --> 05:39.980
No cake!

05:41.248 --> 05:42.952
What if it's something huge?

05:43.019 --> 05:44.689
What if he needs
a heart transplant

05:44.755 --> 05:46.458
or‐or liver transplant?

05:46.526 --> 05:48.262
Or chin, a whole new chin?

05:48.329 --> 05:49.799
What will he touch
when he is thinking?

05:49.866 --> 05:51.569
Regine, you've got to help me.

05:51.636 --> 05:53.573
Clearly somebody has to.

05:54.910 --> 05:56.513
Alright, what do
you want me to do?

05:56.579 --> 05:58.449
Well, girl..

05:58.517 --> 06:01.529
You know how you're this
evil little busy body.

06:01.596 --> 06:04.334
Well, why don't you just
be a dear and find out for me?

06:06.172 --> 06:09.946
Alright, but only because
I need a semi‐sane bride.

06:10.013 --> 06:11.649
Consider this a gift here.

06:11.716 --> 06:13.954
So when your actual
wedding day comes

06:14.021 --> 06:17.494
and you get something modest,
you understand.

06:21.135 --> 06:22.605
I still can't believe it.

06:22.671 --> 06:25.243
My mother eating with my father.

06:25.310 --> 06:26.746
I mean, who ever heard
of such a thing?

06:26.813 --> 06:27.982
Bolt the door.

06:28.049 --> 06:31.222
The four horsemen of
the apocalypse are on their way.

06:32.357 --> 06:33.827
Oh, come on, Khadijah.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.396
It will be fun
to see Uncle Eddie.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.635
Remember that neat
magic trick he used to do?

06:37.701 --> 06:39.605
Oh, yeah,
the one where he disappears

06:39.672 --> 06:41.944
whenever you need him.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.948
Before I help you
get through this

06:44.014 --> 06:47.387
why don't you think
of him as just another man?

06:47.454 --> 06:49.258
You know,
a puppy with pants.

06:50.761 --> 06:54.068
Look, I'll be fine. I'm just
going to support my moms..

06:54.134 --> 06:55.470
[knock on door]

06:55.537 --> 06:58.142
For her sake, I'mma play
this whole thing on the low.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.845
Just watch me.
You're going to be proud.

07:03.326 --> 07:04.930
Ma.

07:04.996 --> 07:07.501
Mummy, mummy,
what were you thinking?

07:07.568 --> 07:08.737
Hello to you, too.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.308
‐ Aunt Rita, Rita, Rita.
‐ Hello.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.346
Okay, look,
ju‐just‐just tell me

07:13.412 --> 07:16.519
why would you have
brunch with daddy?

07:16.586 --> 07:18.790
Well, your father finally
realized that I deserve

07:18.857 --> 07:20.561
to celebrate at least
one Mother's Day.

07:20.627 --> 07:22.164
And I'mma take
him up on it.

07:22.230 --> 07:24.301
I can't remember the last
time the man brought me

07:24.368 --> 07:25.504
a stick of gum.

07:27.074 --> 07:29.545
Oh, I get it.

07:29.612 --> 07:31.616
We're going
to go out and juice him.

07:31.683 --> 07:34.388
Break his pockets
a little some‐some.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.096
Ma, your good. Go ahead, ma.
You witty, witty, ma.

07:38.162 --> 07:39.098
[knock on door]

07:43.172 --> 07:46.312
Uncle Eddie. Uncle Eddie,
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.416
Your pops is fine.

07:49.752 --> 07:52.290
How come I'm getting older
and you aren't?

07:52.357 --> 07:53.927
You are so silly.

07:53.994 --> 07:55.263
[chuckles]

07:58.302 --> 07:59.672
I got a little
cheek he can kiss, too.

07:59.739 --> 08:00.947
'Oh, a big one.'

08:02.484 --> 08:04.889
Look at my little
Hoover star. Still beautiful.

08:04.955 --> 08:07.094
Hey, you still
playing ball?

08:07.160 --> 08:09.765
Oh, no, no. I have a job.

08:09.832 --> 08:11.002
Bill's to pay.

08:11.068 --> 08:13.840
Responsibility.
You know how it is.

08:13.907 --> 08:15.577
Oh, no, you don't,
do you?

08:16.312 --> 08:17.881
Khadijah. Khadijah!

08:17.948 --> 08:19.451
Well, that's,
that's alright, Rita.

08:19.519 --> 08:21.856
She has got
the gift of sarcasm.

08:21.923 --> 08:23.593
It's a James thing.

08:25.030 --> 08:27.768
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Oh, Maxine Shaw.

08:27.835 --> 08:29.304
Attorney, alder‐woman.

08:29.371 --> 08:32.210
I've heard everything.
Everything about you.

08:32.277 --> 08:34.048
And if you take me to
dinner, I'll forget it all.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.052
[laughing]

08:37.520 --> 08:39.091
‐ She means it.
‐ 'Yeah.'

08:39.158 --> 08:42.731
Ah, I'm sorry, I just want
this to be with the family.

08:42.798 --> 08:44.034
Speaking of which

08:44.101 --> 08:45.971
Synclaire, where is this
young man of yours?

08:46.038 --> 08:48.142
I have no idea where he is.

08:48.209 --> 08:49.211
You know how men are.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.150
Always off doing things
nobody knows about.

08:52.217 --> 08:53.386
I don't know where he is.
I don't..

08:53.452 --> 08:54.622
I can't believe
I don't know where he is..

08:54.689 --> 08:56.092
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ Tell me anything.

08:56.158 --> 08:58.096
Just going out
having secret's like he's‐‐

08:58.162 --> 09:00.634
So, uh, are my two
favorite ladies

09:00.701 --> 09:02.611
ready for a night out on a town?

09:02.678 --> 09:04.882
Well, I don't know about
your two favorite ladies

09:04.949 --> 09:06.819
whoever they maybe,
but the mother

09:06.886 --> 09:09.759
of your first born and
the daughter who you only see

09:09.825 --> 09:11.963
when it's convenient
are ready to eat.

09:12.029 --> 09:15.303
Like I'm Overton's keeper.
Please.

09:15.370 --> 09:16.472
He is trying
to keep stuff from me.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.242
We fitting of getting
married? Oh, ho, ho.

09:18.309 --> 09:19.912
That won't happen,
once the ring is on the finger.

09:19.979 --> 09:21.949
Oh, no.
Don't you mess with me.

09:22.016 --> 09:25.924
You tell me, when and where
for art thou, Overton.

09:25.991 --> 09:27.661
Yes, don't mess with me.

09:29.532 --> 09:31.468
[jazz music]

09:32.437 --> 09:35.143
[laughing]

09:35.210 --> 09:37.615
Khadijah, you were so adorable.

09:37.681 --> 09:40.086
Do you remember whenever you
would get an upset stomach?

09:40.153 --> 09:41.088
No.

09:41.155 --> 09:42.357
You would make me sing

09:42.424 --> 09:43.693
the "Get Well Tummy" song

09:43.760 --> 09:44.962
and rub your belly.

09:45.029 --> 09:47.167
And you'd get mad at me
because I didn't sing it right.

09:47.234 --> 09:48.603
That's right. That's right.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.240
I don't remember any of this.

09:50.306 --> 09:52.377
Oh, yeah.

09:52.444 --> 09:54.248
Check this out.

09:54.314 --> 09:55.884
Here I am singing
to your belly

09:55.951 --> 09:57.821
when you were five years old.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.525
‐ That's my tootsie roll bank.
‐ 'Yeah.'

10:01.195 --> 10:03.973
I can't believe you carry
this around in your wallet.

10:05.376 --> 10:09.318
‐ I look miserable.
‐ No. Your stomach hurt.

10:09.384 --> 10:10.921
Or maybe it was your singing.

10:12.825 --> 10:14.394
Ah, now, maybe I can
get the band to play

10:14.461 --> 10:15.997
something
to lighten up the mood.

10:19.204 --> 10:22.210
Golly, ma.
You are a heck of an actress.

10:22.277 --> 10:25.250
You almost got me convinced
you're falling for this garbage.

10:25.316 --> 10:27.521
I'm not falling for anything.

10:27.588 --> 10:29.391
Your father
and I get along fine

10:29.458 --> 10:31.228
just as long as
we're not married.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.270
But, ma, this was suppose
to be about payback.

10:35.336 --> 10:37.307
And the look on
his face when we hit him

10:37.374 --> 10:40.112
with that fat check and bounce.

10:42.718 --> 10:44.922
Band didn't even know
"The Get Well Tummy Song."

10:46.325 --> 10:48.997
But it turns out
they know our song.

10:49.063 --> 10:50.867
‐ May I have this dance with‐‐
‐ No.

10:52.404 --> 10:55.644
This is Mother's Day,
and I'm the mother.

10:56.746 --> 10:58.282
[jazz music]

10:58.349 --> 11:00.353
Your parents?

11:00.420 --> 11:01.929
They look just great together.

11:01.996 --> 11:04.133
Your a very lucky young lady.

11:04.201 --> 11:05.336
Now, if that were true

11:05.403 --> 11:07.039
this wouldn't be
happening to me.

11:07.106 --> 11:08.710
Including you talking to me.

11:12.618 --> 11:15.290
[music continues]

11:19.498 --> 11:20.767
Now here's the kicker.

11:20.834 --> 11:23.239
You could retrieve
any phone number you want

11:23.306 --> 11:25.611
just by speaking
into this bad boy.

11:25.677 --> 11:27.214
But you got
to program it first

11:27.280 --> 11:28.883
so recognize
your voice, see..

11:28.950 --> 11:31.288
Attention,
this is your mother.

11:31.355 --> 11:33.191
Learn my voice or get
sent back to the store.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.666
‐ That is all.
‐ Oh, how nice.

11:36.733 --> 11:37.968
Two people
who don't live here

11:38.035 --> 11:39.438
and one of them is yelling.

11:39.505 --> 11:40.774
Why don't we just
kick a hole

11:40.841 --> 11:42.711
in the sofa
for the fun of it?

11:42.778 --> 11:43.980
I'm down.

11:45.483 --> 11:46.953
Um, Overton.

11:48.322 --> 11:51.763
Pfft. I don't need to be clever.
This is just you.

11:51.829 --> 11:54.100
Now, I understand that
you and Kyle are keeping

11:54.167 --> 11:55.270
something from Synclaire.

11:55.336 --> 11:57.407
What is it?

11:57.474 --> 11:59.945
I just love
that movie "Casino."

12:00.012 --> 12:03.459
Especially that scene
where they stick that guys head

12:03.527 --> 12:07.935
in the vice and tighten it
until his eyes...pop out.

12:09.539 --> 12:14.348
Um, uh, Regine,
the‐the secret is, um..

12:14.414 --> 12:16.485
Synclaire had her heart set

12:16.553 --> 12:19.023
on honeymooning in Australia

12:19.090 --> 12:22.063
and I'm more afraid
of koala bears

12:22.129 --> 12:23.867
than I am of clowns.

12:23.933 --> 12:26.305
Yeah. True that. True that.

12:26.372 --> 12:28.309
I mean, people, people
think they are cute

12:28.376 --> 12:29.979
but they are still bears.

12:31.549 --> 12:33.286
Now you know my shame.

12:33.352 --> 12:34.555
[telephone ringing]

12:36.325 --> 12:37.828
Hello.

12:37.895 --> 12:39.431
Hello, mother.

12:39.498 --> 12:40.701
Ooh, gossip.

12:42.036 --> 12:43.439
What's up, girl?

12:43.507 --> 12:45.476
Girl, I don't know
what happened.

12:45.544 --> 12:48.983
I mean, at first,
it was us against him.

12:49.050 --> 12:52.490
Then it was their song.
Then it was my migraine.

12:54.193 --> 12:55.897
Next thing I know,
they were laughing

12:55.964 --> 12:57.901
and dropping me off.

12:57.968 --> 12:59.304
Good work, mom.

13:01.649 --> 13:03.653
Sookey‐sookey, now.

13:05.390 --> 13:07.394
According to my mother

13:07.460 --> 13:10.065
your mother and your father

13:10.132 --> 13:13.138
are on their way
to Atlantic City in a limo.

13:13.205 --> 13:14.842
Atlantic City?

13:14.909 --> 13:17.146
Aw, well, isn't that romantic?

13:18.783 --> 13:21.121
In a cruel,
heartless sort of way.

13:22.424 --> 13:23.827
Oh, my God.

13:23.893 --> 13:25.496
This is my fault.

13:25.564 --> 13:28.803
I just sat there and
let her get taken in by him.

13:30.072 --> 13:31.543
Well, I'm not letting
her go out like that.

13:31.609 --> 13:34.582
Hmm, no girl.
Come on, let's go.

13:34.649 --> 13:36.184
I just got to run upstairs
and get my camera.

13:36.251 --> 13:38.021
Mom wants me
to take some pictures.

13:38.088 --> 13:40.360
Sorry, Regine.
This is a family thing.

13:40.426 --> 13:41.829
What?

13:41.896 --> 13:43.466
Come on, Max.
You driving.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.035
'Max?'

13:45.102 --> 13:46.806
Since when is she family?

13:46.873 --> 13:47.975
Well, she ain't been
around with you.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.512
‐ You want that.
‐ She ain't been around..

13:59.030 --> 14:01.903
Khadijah. Khadijah.
Please, Khadijah.

14:01.969 --> 14:06.553
We have searched every stupid
inch of every damn casino.

14:06.619 --> 14:08.723
Now, if I don't start
to get some freaking food

14:08.790 --> 14:10.961
I may just to get cranky.

14:11.027 --> 14:12.329
Well, you better
wrestle Cleopatra

14:12.397 --> 14:14.869
for a bowl of them pretzels
because I'm not stopping

14:14.935 --> 14:16.137
until I find my parents.

14:16.204 --> 14:17.139
No.

14:18.041 --> 14:18.977
[gasps]

14:19.043 --> 14:20.714
Look. Look at them.

14:20.781 --> 14:23.185
The faces of those
people in the buffeteria.

14:23.251 --> 14:25.924
They know something about
your mother and father.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.661
I say we go question them.

14:29.865 --> 14:32.069
Ooh, hoo, hoo.
Ooh, bad for you heart.

14:32.136 --> 14:33.171
Bad for your heart.

14:34.642 --> 14:36.244
Would you look at that?

14:36.311 --> 14:37.881
Oh, I know.

14:37.948 --> 14:41.154
An all you can eat
Belgium waffle bar.

14:41.221 --> 14:42.356
No.

14:44.595 --> 14:46.264
Well, how could
you do this to me?

14:46.331 --> 14:49.370
Didn't we drop you off
three hours from here?

14:49.438 --> 14:51.007
Khadijah,
how's your headache?

14:51.074 --> 14:52.511
It's getting worse.

14:55.784 --> 14:57.921
You know, those waffles
are all you can eat.

14:59.759 --> 15:02.437
Khadijah, you're being
rude and ridiculous.

15:02.505 --> 15:04.742
Ma, can't you see
he's just trying to play you?

15:04.809 --> 15:06.277
Except this time
with less hair?

15:06.344 --> 15:07.881
What are you talking about?

15:07.948 --> 15:09.719
He brought you
to Atlantic City!

15:09.785 --> 15:11.656
Some high rolling,
a few drinks

15:11.723 --> 15:14.729
you wake up in
his complimentary hotel room.

15:14.795 --> 15:17.366
First of all,
there is no hotel room.

15:17.434 --> 15:20.707
Second, your father stopped
gambling seven years ago.

15:20.774 --> 15:22.076
And the only reason
we're here

15:22.143 --> 15:24.448
is to see
the Smokey Robinson Show.

15:25.651 --> 15:26.886
Oh!

15:26.953 --> 15:29.023
Oh‐oh. You know this is
not the real crab meat.

15:29.090 --> 15:31.596
This is a fake crab meat.

15:31.663 --> 15:32.665
Not that I care.

15:34.769 --> 15:36.104
Thank you!

15:36.171 --> 15:39.077
After all that's happened,
how can you hang out with him?

15:39.143 --> 15:40.981
Look, baby, nobody
has been as angry

15:41.047 --> 15:42.551
with your father
as I have.

15:42.618 --> 15:45.022
But I can either carry
that bitterness to my grave

15:45.089 --> 15:49.430
or sit in the front row with
my ex and wink at Smokey.

15:49.498 --> 15:51.434
I hear you on that, ma.
That's‐that's great.

15:51.503 --> 15:53.038
But it is gonna take Smokey

15:53.105 --> 15:55.242
and a whole lot more miracles
for me to move on.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.852
Now, hold up there, Khadijah!
Hold up there!

15:59.919 --> 16:00.987
Give me five minutes
to load up.

16:01.054 --> 16:02.464
They just took
the skin off the gravy.

16:02.531 --> 16:03.933
Just five minutes!

16:06.539 --> 16:08.008
Just taking few things.

16:08.075 --> 16:09.243
Few things
for the road.

16:09.310 --> 16:10.747
For the road!

16:12.083 --> 16:13.987
Time for my midnight snack.

16:15.222 --> 16:17.226
Girl, I'm getting into
that wedding dress

16:17.293 --> 16:19.699
if I got to drink
diet shakes all night long.

16:20.801 --> 16:22.436
Well, I didn't get
any decent dirt

16:22.505 --> 16:25.844
but I saved your marriage
and I guess that's something.

16:25.911 --> 16:28.448
Really? You‐you know what
Overton's keeping from me?

16:28.517 --> 16:29.685
Hmm.

16:29.752 --> 16:32.023
Okay, well, tell me!
No, don't.

16:33.425 --> 16:34.729
Well, come on. Tell me!

16:34.795 --> 16:35.997
No, don't, don't, don't.

16:36.064 --> 16:37.266
Okay, I know.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.703
I'll go into the living room

16:38.770 --> 16:40.439
you pretend like
you're telling someone else.

16:40.507 --> 16:41.976
And I'll just overhear.
Okay. Go!

16:45.482 --> 16:48.957
Okay, before you drive us
both completely insane

16:49.023 --> 16:51.427
Overton doesn't want
a vacation in Australia

16:51.494 --> 16:53.600
because he's afraid
of koala bears.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.035
That's absurd!

16:55.102 --> 16:57.941
When Overton was three
he fell into the koala habitat

16:58.008 --> 16:59.477
at the Cleveland Zoo.

16:59.545 --> 17:02.925
The mama koala scooped him up
to safety and he was fine.

17:02.991 --> 17:06.196
Girl, the whole thing
was on "Those Amazing Animals."

17:06.263 --> 17:09.672
I've been duped
by Overton Wakefield Jones?

17:09.739 --> 17:11.040
Apparently!

17:12.810 --> 17:13.880
Hey, ladies. Uh..

17:13.946 --> 17:16.184
Got any more
of those diet shakes?

17:16.251 --> 17:18.757
Found out that's a great way
to wash down cheese cake.

17:19.925 --> 17:22.229
You liar!

17:22.296 --> 17:25.234
Well, don't knock
till you try.

17:25.301 --> 17:28.474
Overton, there's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.881
Something of a personal
and private nature.

17:32.283 --> 17:33.787
Ah, well, you be that way,
then, you hear.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.093
I'll just go over to Kyle's

17:37.159 --> 17:40.099
and see if homeboy able
to drive me to Atlantic City.

17:41.467 --> 17:43.438
It is time to stop the insanity.

17:43.506 --> 17:45.342
You and Kyle are keeping
something from me

17:45.409 --> 17:47.146
and I want you
to tell me what it is.

17:48.048 --> 17:50.854
I, I can't do that, baby.

17:50.921 --> 17:53.927
What? I'm about to be your wife!

17:53.993 --> 17:55.329
Look, Kyle is my best friend

17:55.395 --> 17:57.635
and I promised not
to divulge the information.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.506
Alright.

18:00.573 --> 18:03.385
What about I promised
to the same secrecy

18:03.451 --> 18:06.057
plus I give you a yummy
marshmallow massage?

18:09.330 --> 18:11.769
Kyle and Max are doing
the wild thing again. Let's go.

18:13.138 --> 18:14.775
Wait, wait, wait.
That's your secret?

18:14.842 --> 18:16.979
Oh, I knew that!

18:17.046 --> 18:18.883
The‐the, his room
is right above mine.

18:18.950 --> 18:20.621
I hear, heard them through
the vent one night.

18:20.687 --> 18:21.889
Oh, please.

18:21.956 --> 18:23.927
Guess what?

18:23.993 --> 18:26.064
Max coos like a pigeon.

18:30.573 --> 18:32.376
Child, that's Kyle.

18:32.443 --> 18:34.313
‐ No!
‐ Yeah.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.951
Coo, coo!

18:39.023 --> 18:41.127
[coins jingling]

18:41.194 --> 18:42.765
[laughing]
Did I ever tell you

18:42.831 --> 18:44.702
how my father used
to take us fly fishing?

18:44.769 --> 18:47.173
In Montana. Every summer.

18:47.239 --> 18:49.645
Every sum.. Every summer!
Every damn summer!

18:50.914 --> 18:52.951
Large mouth bass.

18:53.018 --> 18:54.955
Woo‐hoo.

18:55.022 --> 18:57.326
Well, at least
your father was there.

18:57.393 --> 18:59.397
I had a drive‐by daddy.

18:59.463 --> 19:01.101
Every now and then,
he'd roll up

19:01.167 --> 19:02.811
throw a few empty
promises my way

19:02.878 --> 19:04.047
and keep on moving.

19:04.113 --> 19:05.315
Oh, I get it.

19:05.382 --> 19:08.088
Mm‐hmm. Forget him.

19:08.155 --> 19:10.459
Oh, look who's driving
up on you now.

19:10.526 --> 19:11.696
Alright. I guess I'll go watch

19:11.763 --> 19:13.833
Moses free his people
from Egypt.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.937
They got a show
in 15 minutes.

19:16.004 --> 19:18.208
Who is your messiah now?

19:20.714 --> 19:22.049
It's better
if you use the lever.

19:22.116 --> 19:23.318
A‐and when you pull it

19:23.385 --> 19:24.689
yank it
like you mean it.

19:25.556 --> 19:28.228
I can handle it!
Thank you!

19:28.295 --> 19:30.332
You never
did listen to me.

19:30.399 --> 19:32.336
Well, I've kind of
a short attention span.

19:32.403 --> 19:33.606
Especially since
I only hear from you

19:33.672 --> 19:35.811
every six months.

19:35.877 --> 19:37.848
You know, the only reason you're
here is for Synclaire's wedding!

19:37.915 --> 19:41.655
No, I'm here because I wanted
to be with my family.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.860
Khadijah, when your mother
and I had you

19:43.927 --> 19:46.231
we were younger
than you are now!

19:46.297 --> 19:47.600
I wasn't ready
to be a father

19:47.667 --> 19:50.239
and I made
a lot of mistakes!

19:50.305 --> 19:52.376
A whole lot of mistakes, daddy.

19:52.443 --> 19:54.447
Mad goo gobs of mistakes.

19:54.514 --> 19:56.819
Why you wait
until now to say it?

19:56.886 --> 19:58.622
Another mistake.

19:58.689 --> 19:59.658
But I'm still your father.

19:59.725 --> 20:01.394
Maybe you feel like
you don't need me

20:01.461 --> 20:02.871
but I need you.

20:02.938 --> 20:04.107
Why?

20:04.173 --> 20:05.610
'Cause you are one
of the few things in my life

20:05.676 --> 20:07.848
I didn't mess up!

20:07.915 --> 20:09.785
Khadijah, you became

20:09.852 --> 20:12.223
a strong, intelligent..

20:12.289 --> 20:15.095
...beautiful young woman.

20:15.162 --> 20:17.499
I just wish I could say
I had more to do with it.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.939
So do I.

20:23.145 --> 20:24.480
I'm sorry, I..

20:24.548 --> 20:26.351
I don't know
how I can pay you back

20:26.417 --> 20:28.088
for all the times
I wasn't there.

20:29.490 --> 20:30.425
Give me a dollar.

20:32.931 --> 20:33.967
Okay.

20:36.437 --> 20:39.110
Come on!

20:40.747 --> 20:42.183
A‐almost.
Just pull down faster.

20:42.249 --> 20:43.820
Let it go and snap!

20:48.261 --> 20:49.965
Uh..
Uh..

20:50.032 --> 20:52.203
‐ Damn!
‐ Damn!

20:52.269 --> 20:54.240
Come on, give me more!
Give me more!

20:54.307 --> 20:57.346
Khadijah, I'm not trying
to buy your affections.

20:57.413 --> 20:58.682
For three dollars?

21:00.485 --> 21:02.163
Look, I‐I I'm gonna go
find your mother

21:02.229 --> 21:04.467
and tell her where we are.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.437
I'll be back,
I promise.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.277
Alright.

21:09.343 --> 21:10.445
Hey!

21:15.523 --> 21:17.459
[slot machines clanging]

21:23.271 --> 21:24.407
Come on. Come..

21:24.473 --> 21:25.409
Oh!

21:25.475 --> 21:26.612
[coins jingling]

21:26.678 --> 21:28.348
Big money! Daddy!

21:28.415 --> 21:30.887
Dad! Oh, my God! Ha, ha!

21:30.954 --> 21:32.123
'Whoo!'

21:32.189 --> 21:33.325
I won!

21:33.391 --> 21:36.031
Me, with my father's money!

21:36.097 --> 21:37.033
I did it!
