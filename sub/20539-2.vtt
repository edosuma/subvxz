00:03.711 --> 00:05.044
<i>Strongarm, are you there?</i>

00:05.045 --> 00:07.149
<i>Is that Stunticon turning out
to be a big problem?</i>

00:07.150 --> 00:08.674
You're trespassing.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.111
I've claimed this valley for my chief.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.810
It has been a long time
since I've seen such speed and agility.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.018
I am so ready
for today's championship game.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.753
Apply some coolant wouldn't you?

00:20.755 --> 00:23.489
I'd like to see something
even try to surprise us.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.257
Aliens.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.458
Have you seen any?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.653
Uh, no?

00:28.796 --> 00:30.763
Does Stunticon have some friends?

00:30.764 --> 00:32.165
He has missiles.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.287
One 'Con with some
missiles shouldn't be too tough.

00:35.134 --> 00:37.470
The nuclear waste disposal site.

00:38.723 --> 00:41.465
One for each of us, scrap.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.348
We can't let those missiles
explode on the ground

00:50.350 --> 00:51.468
in this part of the valley.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.956
Everyone rev up and roll out, fast.

00:59.325 --> 01:02.093
Pour it on, team.
Head for those mountains.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.896
Wait. Where's Grimlock?

01:08.801 --> 01:14.376
Keep going. I'll catch up. Might
be tomorrow but I'll catch up.

01:16.809 --> 01:17.911
He is too slow.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.747
He's not gonna make it.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.708
and try to push
Grimlock out of the way.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.411
No. I recognize
that type of missile.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.880
Amplify comm signals

02:19.872 --> 02:21.473
Good thinking, Drift.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.941
We shorted out
the missiles' detonators.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.543
Precisely.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.980
I can't contact the Scrapyard.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.515
That stunt zotzed our comms.

02:30.517 --> 02:33.654
If he fires more rockets at us,
we can't try that again.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.435
Not that our comms
were working so well,

02:35.460 --> 02:37.823
with all that background
nuclear radiation interfering.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.959
Hi, guys. I'm alive.

02:40.961 --> 02:44.095
I wonder what effect that
radiation is having on us.

02:44.097 --> 02:47.032
Yeah, let's deal with this
Stunticon as quickly as possible.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.734
Agreed.
He caught me off-guard before

02:49.736 --> 02:51.603
but now that I know
what we're up against,

02:51.605 --> 02:53.138
we'll make short work of this perp.

02:57.643 --> 03:01.546
We know he's hiding up there. Stay behind
cover as much as possible on the way.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.949
- You too, Grimlock.
- I won't argue.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.952
Sir, regulations specifically say...

03:06.954 --> 03:09.888
Strongarm, we tackle missions
like this all the time.

03:11.123 --> 03:12.624
Yes, sir.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.619
Then let's rev up and roll out.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.175
Stay behind cover.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.177
Stay behind cover.

03:26.606 --> 03:27.979
Stay behind cover.

03:49.161 --> 03:52.564
Rusty, get your head
back in the game, pal.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.443
It's the championship.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.170
You missed a field goal.
It's not a big deal.

03:59.172 --> 04:02.674
No, he's a big deal.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.709
As long as they have that kid

04:04.711 --> 04:06.978
I'll never make another field goal.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.781
I shouldn't have shot my mouth
off before the game.

04:17.723 --> 04:21.692
With missiles in the equation, it's a good
thing this valley has been evacuated.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.129
Well, not completely evacuated.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.249
What does that mean?

04:30.236 --> 04:32.604
We encountered
some kind of hermit, sir.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.307
But he didn't see us in
Bot-Mode, so our cover is good.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.034
We didn't want him finding out who
we were, so we got out of there.

04:38.035 --> 04:41.146
Well, his life is in danger, so go
back there and get him to leave.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.148
But Lieutenant, in this situation...

04:43.150 --> 04:46.151
In this situation, you get
that hermit out of here.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.213
Go.

04:48.187 --> 04:49.504
Will do, Bee.

04:49.539 --> 04:54.718
Ha. Caught up to you.
Must be getting faster.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.766
Aw, no fair.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.281
Hmm.
Cover here is scarce.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.149
It's the only way through.

05:23.789 --> 05:25.323
What's with all these barrels?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.093
Does this Stunticon really
think these will stop us?

05:28.095 --> 05:30.829
Heh, maybe he's not
so bright after all.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.708
He filled these barrels with oil.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.276
Each one of them is a bomb.

05:48.347 --> 05:51.082
Got the message yet, Autobots?

05:51.084 --> 05:54.786
When Heatseeker claims
territory for his chief,

05:54.788 --> 05:57.420
it stays claimed.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.523
Evasive maneuvers.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.142
We are fortunate to be far

06:17.144 --> 06:19.110
from the nuclear waste disposal site.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.312
Explosions here will not damage it.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.053
Some easy mission.

06:23.054 --> 06:25.884
Strongarm was right: we were
completely unprepared

06:25.886 --> 06:28.353
for something like this
because I let us go soft.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.289
Now is not the time
for self-recrimination.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.024
We must regain our focus.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.927
That is what makes our team
so successful.

06:43.952 --> 06:46.450
You'll never take me, aliens.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.008
Oh. It's you again.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.343
Did you find any aliens, hm?

06:52.345 --> 06:55.113
Sir, you have to leave
this area immediately.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.148
There's danger of a radiation leak.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.548
Mule muffins.

06:58.552 --> 07:02.454
That's just another government
cover story, trying to scare us.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.456
I'm not leaving till I contact

07:04.458 --> 07:08.269
some honest-to-goodness
extraterrestrials.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.272
Well, now what?

07:12.273 --> 07:14.833
We've done everything
just like the manual says.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.736
Well, if he wants to see aliens,

07:17.738 --> 07:18.903
maybe we show him aliens.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.305
What? No way.

07:20.307 --> 07:26.177
Hey, desperate times
call for desperate measures.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.113
You still here?

07:39.358 --> 07:43.795
Greetings. From another world.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.867
Aliens!

07:53.472 --> 07:56.074
You're... You're...
You're real...

07:56.076 --> 07:57.509
A real alien.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.245
Oh, scrud, Sideswipe.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.414
Even though I've been saying it
for all these years, I...

08:03.416 --> 08:05.283
I never thought I'd actually see...

08:05.285 --> 08:07.285
Ugh.
I better call someone.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.354
The newspapers.
The army.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.616
What? Wait, no, no, no.

08:13.954 --> 08:16.861
We come in peace, human.

08:16.863 --> 08:20.899
We have been among you,
hiding and observing for years.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.968
And we bring great secret
knowledge to share.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.839
Yeah, uh, uh, yes, but we will tell you

08:27.841 --> 08:29.974
when you can share this wondrous news

08:29.976 --> 08:31.209
with the rest of your planet.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.880
No.
You're not aliens.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.515
No visitors from other planets

08:37.517 --> 08:40.451
would disguise themselves
as flashy cars.

08:41.986 --> 08:45.390
I... I must be hallucinating.
yeah.

08:45.392 --> 08:50.028
Yeah, that's it. Ugh. The government
put something in my cactus juice.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.530
It's not going to work, you hear me.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.031
Ho, ho!
I'm on to you!

09:02.575 --> 09:04.843
Well played, Sideswipe.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.944
Back at you.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.350
Come on out, Autobots.

09:12.352 --> 09:16.387
What are you scared of?
A few missiles?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.263
We're pinned here,
what we need is a diversion.

09:20.993 --> 09:24.688
- Hi guys. I made it.
- Grimlock. Perfect.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.998
We need you to distract
this Stunticon, Heatseeker,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.200
so Drift and I can get close
to him and take him out.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.302
But beware.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.604
He has protected himself
with oil-filled barrels

09:32.606 --> 09:34.272
that his missiles can explode.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.341
No, I got this.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.542
'Atta Dino.

09:37.544 --> 09:41.141
Heads up, coming at you.

09:44.016 --> 09:46.117
I got this, I got this.

09:51.624 --> 09:55.603
Okay, we don't want that
happening too often.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.662
That ought to make him think twice.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.105
Wait, there was two others.

10:07.107 --> 10:11.009
How do you like that, Drift?
He is smarter than he looks.

10:12.213 --> 10:15.920
It doesn't take a genius
to lay the smack down on you.

10:31.530 --> 10:36.737
You just paid the Stunticon's
toll, you broken toaster.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.379
I don't care
what you are, Heatseeker.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.401
You're just another 'Con to me.

10:54.119 --> 10:58.122
Whoa! Ugh!

11:03.756 --> 11:05.396
Aw, scrap.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.754
See you down the road, Autobot.

11:17.142 --> 11:19.648
Hey. What are you...? Ugh.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.151
I... I...

11:30.122 --> 11:33.955
I can fly! Whoo-whoo!

11:37.429 --> 11:40.538
Whoa. Ugh.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.603
Wha...?
What are you doing, son?

11:45.605 --> 11:48.006
- The game's not over.
- It is for me.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.408
Rusty. Field goal
time. You're in.

11:50.410 --> 11:55.079
Sorry, Hank, I can't...
I'm injured.

11:55.081 --> 11:58.249
- Injured?
- It was that last kick I tried...

11:58.251 --> 12:00.318
I did something to my ankle.

12:01.587 --> 12:02.687
Ow.

12:03.478 --> 12:05.757
Well, if we don't have our best kicker,

12:05.759 --> 12:07.446
we'll just have to go for a first down.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.658
Feel better.

12:10.662 --> 12:14.465
Rusty, why'd you lie?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.601
If I go out there, I'm just
going to hurt the team

12:16.603 --> 12:18.603
and make myself look silly.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.239
You'll hurt them more
if you don't even try.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.863
But I did try.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.412
You know, I was a good student
when I was your age.

12:27.414 --> 12:31.182
Made all A's.
But then I got a D.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.650
It floored me.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.585
For a long time after that,

12:34.587 --> 12:37.288
I didn't think I could ever
get an A again.

12:37.290 --> 12:41.359
So you quit school and started a
successful business selling vintage stuff?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.528
No.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.230
I realized that if I quit then,

12:46.232 --> 12:48.499
I could find a reason to quit anything

12:48.501 --> 12:49.667
for the rest of my life.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.195
And I didn't wanna do that.

12:51.196 --> 12:56.035
So I went back, figured out what I
was doing wrong and worked at it.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.699
Hard.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.529
And I started getting A's again.

13:01.381 --> 13:08.086
And after I graduated, then I started a
successful business selling vintage stuff.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.288
Alright, way to go, everybody.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.213
Sounds like your team scored.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.358
You could still pull this game out.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.396
There's plenty of time left.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.742
This is fantastic.

13:33.545 --> 13:36.514
Yeeee-haw!

13:38.417 --> 13:41.119
But who are you?
How did you...

13:41.121 --> 13:42.825
Why did you do this?

13:43.590 --> 13:46.007
Hang on sounds like
we're not alone up here.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.798
Drift, are you damaged?

13:53.800 --> 13:56.134
I am fine.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.598
Where's Bee?

13:59.805 --> 14:01.139
Oh.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.744
Bee's been holding out on us.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.746
He never said he could fly.

14:08.748 --> 14:12.383
It looks like he has some
kind of a modification.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.203
A Mini-Con?

14:27.232 --> 14:29.330
Great job, Lieutenant.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.905
All right.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.174
I bet he spotted that Stunticon.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.556
Let's get over there.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.762
No, you all go ahead, I'll catch up.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.805
Come on, come on.

14:52.562 --> 14:57.361
Gotta get out to this valley before the
government shows up to lock me away,

14:57.363 --> 15:02.485
or before the alien invasion
starts, whichever...

15:03.269 --> 15:06.437
I was headed back to my chief
to get some help

15:06.439 --> 15:08.606
with these pesky Autobots,

15:08.608 --> 15:13.945
but maybe I've got all the help
I need right here.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.689
It ain't a talking alien car, man,

15:24.691 --> 15:27.959
you're still seeing things,
just keep working.

15:27.961 --> 15:32.897
Heatseeker. Roll away from the human.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.566
Just get in the van, man.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.991
Drive away from the hallucinations.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.411
We're on top of a nuclear waste
dump, Decepticon,

15:47.413 --> 15:49.671
don't do anything foolish.

15:54.953 --> 15:57.047
Hi, guys, I'm...

15:59.758 --> 16:03.648
Oh, business time.
Game face.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.981
Don't let him fire.
Smother him.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.038
The chief ain't gonna like this.

16:56.014 --> 17:00.200
Huh? But the chief will like this.

17:03.822 --> 17:04.821
Time out. Time out.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.959
How's it looking out there?
Time's running out.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.862
We can maybe run one more play
and hope for a miracle.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.131
Or, we could try a field goal.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.469
- But your ankle...
- It feels a lot better.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.471
What about the tall kid?

17:20.473 --> 17:21.906
I've been working the problem.

17:21.907 --> 17:25.810
To get the ball over that kid,
it's gonna have to fly higher, earlier.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.519
If I change the angle of my leg...

17:27.519 --> 17:30.915
And if I tilt the ball a little more
when I hold it for you...

17:30.917 --> 17:32.342
Let's give it a try.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.618
Yes.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.077
Yes. Heh. What a kick.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.933
What... What happened?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.002
Is everyone okay?

18:25.004 --> 18:27.864
Ugh. I feel weird.

18:27.864 --> 18:30.941
Like I transformed
but in a different way, maybe.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.079
I feel like I had a bunch
of stuff on my head.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.815
I remember only darkness.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.335
Whatever it was seems to be over.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.088
Probably, we were just knocked
silly by the explosion.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.264
We have been most fortunate.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.771
It appears the blast did not
damage the ground,

18:48.895 --> 18:50.687
or anything beneath it.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.830
No sign of Heatseeker,

18:52.832 --> 18:54.765
or the Mini-Con
that helped me fly.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.200
Judging by these tracks,

18:56.202 --> 18:58.202
it doesn't look like
they were destroyed.

18:58.204 --> 19:01.806
Scrud. I'll tell you something
else there's no sign of,

19:01.808 --> 19:03.140
my Decepticon Hunter.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.542
I'm on it.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.114
Maybe it was destroyed?

19:10.116 --> 19:12.883
Could have been, I suppose.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.954
I scouted
to a quarter-klick out.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.656
No sign of your DH, boss.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.510
There's nothing more to be done
here, let's head home for now.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.661
We need to re-focus
on preparation.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.563
I don't want us
taken by surprise again.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.899
Sir, even sticking
too tightly to the rules

19:28.901 --> 19:30.201
can get you in trouble.

19:30.203 --> 19:34.238
That's a good point, Cadet. But the least
we can do is stay on top of our training

19:34.240 --> 19:37.074
and be flexible in case of
anything we're not expecting.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.976
We can't take anything for granted.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.878
The stakes we play for are too high.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.315
Let's rev up and roll out.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.168
Heatseeker.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.240
Why aren't you holding your territory?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.568
Ran into some Autobots.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.638
I could have taken them,
but I found this

20:07.640 --> 20:11.041
and thought I should bring it
back to you, pronto, chief.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.142
What is it?

20:12.142 --> 20:13.978
Looks Cybertronian.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.514
Yeah, I found it in a crater

20:16.516 --> 20:19.850
with a bunch of destroyed
Cybertronian stuff

20:19.852 --> 20:21.986
but this still works.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.190
It gets like this whenever it's
around anything from back home.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.959
So? Big deal.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.863
Chief, it finds Cybertronian tech

20:32.865 --> 20:35.799
and there's tons of it on this mudball.

20:35.801 --> 20:40.704
Ah, stuff we can use
to help us take over Earth's roads.

20:54.986 --> 20:57.154
You have done well.

20:57.156 --> 21:01.696
Bring Bumblebee's
Decepticon Hunter to me.
