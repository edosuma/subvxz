(male narrator)
Tonight, on a very special
part one

00:05.267 --> 00:10.200
of a very special two-part
season finale of Clone High,

00:10.200 --> 00:12.400
it's prom season,
and Abe must choose

00:12.400 --> 00:14.500
between the woman he loves

00:14.500 --> 00:17.233
and that other girl
with the red hair.

00:17.233 --> 00:20.200
Hey, Mike, bring up that shot
of the two of them roll--

00:20.200 --> 00:21.667
Yeah, that's the one.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.233
Well, I'll be in my trailer.

00:23.233 --> 00:26.067
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:26.067 --> 00:29.000
* Secret government employees

00:29.000 --> 00:31.900
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:31.900 --> 00:34.933
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:34.933 --> 00:37.733
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:37.733 --> 00:40.667
* They're gonna make it
if they try *

00:40.667 --> 00:43.467
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:43.467 --> 00:49.800
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:49.800 --> 00:52.533
* Clone High

00:52.533 --> 00:58.200
* Clone High

00:58.200 --> 00:59.633
[helicopter rotors whirring]

00:59.633 --> 01:00.633
[grunts and gasps]

01:02.833 --> 01:07.233
Marie Antoinette, will you go
to the prom with me?

01:07.233 --> 01:08.333
Merde!

01:10.767 --> 01:12.567
Anne Boleyn...

01:12.567 --> 01:14.533
You think people are going
a little overboard

01:14.533 --> 01:15.967
on these prom invitations?

01:17.500 --> 01:18.600
[horse whinnies]

01:18.600 --> 01:20.133
[horse screams]

01:20.133 --> 01:26.700
Helen of Troy, will you go
to the prom with Nostradamus?

01:26.700 --> 01:28.767
Uh, no.

01:28.767 --> 01:31.167
I knew you were going
to say that.

01:31.167 --> 01:33.433
Ugh, if you're gonna
ask a girl to prom,

01:33.433 --> 01:35.100
try to avoid
the usual clichés,

01:35.100 --> 01:37.633
like your helicopter
or your talking fetal horse.

01:37.633 --> 01:40.333
Whatever, I don't need
some guy in rented pants

01:40.333 --> 01:41.633
taking me to a dance.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.567
Dance?

01:43.567 --> 01:45.800
Joan, you know the expression

01:45.800 --> 01:48.867
"Prom is the single most
important event in your life"?

01:48.867 --> 01:49.867
No.

01:49.867 --> 01:52.433
Well, now you do.

01:52.433 --> 01:53.767
You want to be president?

01:53.767 --> 01:56.567
Well, you better go to prom,
because all of them did.

01:56.567 --> 01:57.733
Plus, prom is the night

01:57.733 --> 02:00.567
where everyone
steps up a base, sex-wise.

02:00.567 --> 02:05.267
Uh, listen, Abe, I really
don't want to go to prom.

02:05.267 --> 02:08.267
Abe, why are you wasting time
on that eyesore Joan?

02:08.267 --> 02:09.400
Shouldn't you be planning

02:09.400 --> 02:10.967
on how you're asking me
to the prom?

02:10.967 --> 02:14.067
Which, since I'm Cleopatra,
will be the most original

02:14.067 --> 02:16.333
and elaborate prom-posal
this school has ever seen.

02:16.333 --> 02:19.167
Yeah, yeah,
I'll get to it, Cleo.

02:19.167 --> 02:22.367
Oh, Joan,
you poor spinster.

02:22.367 --> 02:27.400
I'll make sure you get to prom,
one way or another.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.767
Whoooo! Whoo!

02:29.767 --> 02:32.333
So, um, do you have
a prom date?

02:32.333 --> 02:34.067
No takers so far,
Marie Curie,

02:34.067 --> 02:37.067
but I can't wait
to tear up the dance floor.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.833
And now that my testicles
have descended,

02:38.833 --> 02:41.467
I can't wait
for some serious dry humping.

02:41.467 --> 02:42.767
Yeah.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.067
Dry what?

02:44.067 --> 02:45.633
You know, like this...

02:45.633 --> 02:47.200
[grunting]

02:47.200 --> 02:48.467
But with your clothes on.

02:48.467 --> 02:51.267
That sounds kind of nice.

02:51.267 --> 02:52.567
Can't talk now, Marie.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.133
Got to go find me
a prom date.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.400
* Tra-la-la,
la-la, la-la *

02:56.400 --> 02:59.467
(Mr. Butlertron)
Are you sure
making a documentary

02:59.467 --> 03:02.967
revealing your evil plan
is the best idea?

03:02.967 --> 03:05.367
Quiet, Mr. B.
It's on.

03:05.367 --> 03:07.567
I first got the idea
for Cloney Island

03:07.567 --> 03:10.533
after seeing the movie
Jurassic Park III.

03:10.533 --> 03:13.133
But my ill-conceived
amusement park will be filled

03:13.133 --> 03:16.867
with human clones
instead of zoo animals.

03:16.867 --> 03:19.733
It's as foolproof
as the amusement park

03:19.733 --> 03:21.333
in the movie itself.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.333
[phone rings]

03:22.333 --> 03:24.433
[laughing]

03:24.433 --> 03:27.400
Stamos on line two.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.367
Is it prom season already?

03:29.367 --> 03:32.100
He beat me out for prom king
in high school,

03:32.100 --> 03:34.733
and every year,
he calls to rub it in.

03:34.733 --> 03:37.700
John!
Good to hear from you.

03:37.700 --> 03:38.800
[laughing]

03:38.800 --> 03:41.967
Yes, I do remember that.

03:41.967 --> 03:44.067
Yeah, you won, all right.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.500
Uh, say hi to Rebecca for me.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.867
Okay, sure.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.733
I will.
Okay? Yeah.

03:49.733 --> 03:51.233
[polite laughter]

03:51.233 --> 03:52.900
Stamos!

03:52.900 --> 03:56.200
Oh! There goes my whole day!

03:56.200 --> 03:57.933
I hate Stamos!

03:59.067 --> 04:00.500
Motherfu--

04:00.500 --> 04:02.933
[both slurping]

04:02.933 --> 04:04.967
You know, Cleo,

04:04.967 --> 04:07.900
prom is an important time
for all teens.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.933
For example, it's where
we all lose our virginity.

04:10.933 --> 04:15.367
[laughing]

04:15.367 --> 04:18.733
I mean, right,
we're all virgins.

04:18.733 --> 04:21.533
Cleo, I have something
important to ask you.

04:21.533 --> 04:27.067
Cleo, will you please
do me the honor

04:27.067 --> 04:29.767
of giving Joan a makeover
so she can get a prom date?

04:29.767 --> 04:30.867
What?

04:30.867 --> 04:32.233
Abe, even though
we're going out,

04:32.233 --> 04:33.700
you still have to ask me
to prom,

04:33.700 --> 04:36.700
and my invite has to be perfect
in every way.

04:36.700 --> 04:40.433
Because, and this may have
slipped your mind,

04:40.433 --> 04:42.633
I'm Cleopatra.

04:42.633 --> 04:44.067
Joan, I'm on it.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.467
I'm just procrastinating
for some reason.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.067
There's no time
to explain why.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.967
But here's a little joke
to tide you over.

04:49.967 --> 04:51.767
I've seen the other invites.

04:51.767 --> 04:54.267
Two words: Bor-ing.

04:55.567 --> 04:57.067
[women chatting and giggling]

04:57.067 --> 04:58.233
[women gasp]

04:58.233 --> 04:59.367
Catherine the Great,

04:59.367 --> 05:01.133
you ready to do
the dry humpty hump?

05:01.133 --> 05:03.133
Ah, get off your high horse.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.133
Susan B. Anthony,

05:04.133 --> 05:05.633
I got a dollar that says

05:05.633 --> 05:09.333
you got an addiction
to friction.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.467
[toilet flushes]

05:11.467 --> 05:13.067
Eva Perón.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.733
You keep your distance!

05:16.433 --> 05:19.067
I just want someone to love,

05:19.067 --> 05:22.100
dry hump, leave,
and then brag about.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.633
Is that so wrong?

05:25.100 --> 05:27.067
Get a load of that loser.

05:27.067 --> 05:30.533
Talking to himself
in the mirror.

05:30.533 --> 05:31.667
You, handsome guy.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.067
What're you looking at?

05:33.067 --> 05:34.700
I'm looking at you, hotshot.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.733
Your devilish good looks
don't impress me.

05:36.733 --> 05:39.133
Well, what would impress you,
dreamboat?

05:39.133 --> 05:42.367
Getting that shrimp cocktail,
Gandhi, a prom date is what.

05:42.367 --> 05:43.733
What, are you cuckoo?

05:43.733 --> 05:46.567
What's the matter, turkey?
Chicken?

05:46.567 --> 05:49.367
A fin says I get
the crybaby a prom date.

05:49.367 --> 05:51.567
You got yourself a bet.

05:51.567 --> 05:54.267
You got yourself a bet,
pretty boy.

05:54.267 --> 05:58.067
Ugh, why do you let that guy
get to you?

06:03.100 --> 06:06.367
Abe, you mentioned
an important prom decision

06:06.367 --> 06:07.933
that you made about me?

06:07.933 --> 06:09.700
That's right, Joan.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.700
I did, Joan.

06:13.933 --> 06:17.967
Joan, would you make me
the happiest guy on Earth

06:17.967 --> 06:20.533
and accompany me to...

06:20.533 --> 06:22.600
the mirror so I can give you
a makeover

06:22.600 --> 06:24.267
so some other guy
will go to prom with you?

06:24.267 --> 06:26.233
Oh, Abe, of course I'd love--

06:26.233 --> 06:27.733
Uh, make-what now?

06:27.733 --> 06:29.433
Don't thank me yet.

06:29.433 --> 06:31.867
We got a lot of work to do.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.167
A lot of work.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.800
Uh, in what universe
would I ever let you

06:35.800 --> 06:37.067
give me a makeover?

06:37.067 --> 06:40.600
In the universe
where I care about you, Joan.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.933
God knows I should be busy
planning a fancy way

06:42.933 --> 06:44.433
to invite Cleo to prom,

06:44.433 --> 06:45.967
but I can't get you
out of my mind.

06:45.967 --> 06:47.467
I'm in your mind?

06:47.467 --> 06:49.733
We'll have to spend
a lot of time alone together.

06:49.733 --> 06:52.067
Alone...together?

06:52.067 --> 06:53.567
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:53.567 --> 06:56.467
Oh, Abe, I've been waiting
for this moment my whole--

06:56.467 --> 06:57.900
Makeover!

06:57.900 --> 06:59.900
(men)
* Makeover, makeover

06:59.900 --> 07:01.133
* Makeover, makeover

07:01.133 --> 07:02.800
* Makeover, makeover

07:02.800 --> 07:04.533
* Makeover

07:04.533 --> 07:06.300
* Makeover, makeover

07:06.300 --> 07:07.867
* Makeover, makeover

07:07.867 --> 07:09.600
* Makeover, makeover

07:09.600 --> 07:11.233
* Makeover

07:11.233 --> 07:12.700
* Makeover, makeover

07:12.700 --> 07:14.967
* Makeover, makeover

07:14.967 --> 07:20.167
* For you and me

07:20.167 --> 07:24.767
Joan, are you ready
to be blown away?

07:26.633 --> 07:32.067
[horrified screaming]

07:32.067 --> 07:33.700
Joan, wait!

07:33.700 --> 07:36.133
You forgot
your sexy vampire teeth.

07:36.133 --> 07:38.867
[Joan screaming]

07:42.367 --> 07:45.733
[airplane engine humming]

07:45.733 --> 07:47.133
Joan. Joan.

07:48.367 --> 07:49.667
Go away, Abe.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.767
I used to feel good
about myself,

07:51.767 --> 07:53.500
and then I met you.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.067
But, Joan, you're so close.

07:56.067 --> 07:59.867
I can almost see the beauty that
is locked away inside of you,

07:59.867 --> 08:02.067
hidden far, far
below the surface

08:02.067 --> 08:03.467
where no one can see it.

08:03.467 --> 08:05.733
I don't want
to be beautiful, Abe.

08:05.733 --> 08:07.533
I just want you.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.167
To get you a prom date.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.400
I'm two to three steps
ahead of you, Joan.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.467
That's why I had
these flyers made up.

08:15.067 --> 08:17.333
Hey, Gandhi,
funny seeing you here...

08:17.333 --> 08:18.667
[chuckles nervously]

08:18.667 --> 08:20.933
During our common
lunch period.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.800
Yeah, that is funny.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.667
Yeah.

08:24.667 --> 08:28.067
[long nervous laughter]

08:29.533 --> 08:31.600
Hey, you,
half-pint,

08:31.600 --> 08:34.533
Junior Mint, pip-squeak,
Tiny Tim, yardstick,

08:34.533 --> 08:37.700
snack pack, wee fella,
brown leprechaun.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.567
Are you talking to me?

08:41.567 --> 08:44.600
Now, listen, I'm gonna help you
get a prom date.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.900
But at this point,

08:45.900 --> 08:47.767
your ass is neither
round nor high enough

08:47.767 --> 08:50.133
to pull in the caliber
of Betty I do.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.733
You let the dogs out, J-slice.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.800
Wazzup!

08:54.800 --> 08:56.367
Let's start
with that crap.

08:56.367 --> 08:58.067
Your Gandhi speak
is all wet.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.100
What?

08:59.100 --> 09:01.133
You can't touch this.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.233
Here, read this.

09:03.233 --> 09:04.567
[clears throat]

09:04.567 --> 09:06.633
For supper,
I want a party platter.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.433
No! No! No!

09:08.433 --> 09:10.133
Like this.

09:10.133 --> 09:18.133
Fowah suppah, I, er, uh,

09:18.133 --> 09:24.300
For sopar, I want
ahh perty plotter.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.700
Quit looking so smug,
pretty pants.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.733
Says who? You?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.233
No, says me, you!

09:29.233 --> 09:31.133
Wh-what's goin' on?

09:31.133 --> 09:34.400
Forget it, kid.
No dry porking for you.

09:36.433 --> 09:39.133
[groaning]

09:41.167 --> 09:49.467
Fowah suppah,
I want a pawty plattehr!

09:49.467 --> 09:51.233
Wait a minute.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.333
Throw some "er"s and "uh"s
in there.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.500
What's your hurry?
Fowah...

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
Fowah...

09:56.500 --> 09:57.767
- Suppah...
- Suppah...

09:57.767 --> 10:00.433
- I, er, uh...
- I, er, uh...

10:00.433 --> 10:01.733
- Want...

10:01.733 --> 10:02.967
- Ah...

10:02.967 --> 10:04.000
- Pawty...
- Pawty...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.200
[together]
Plattah!

10:06.200 --> 10:08.400
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

10:08.400 --> 10:11.133
[together]
Er, uh, makeovah!

* For you and me

10:25.233 --> 10:27.867
Wait. One last thing.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.867
You look like an angel.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.367
Stamos!

10:35.367 --> 10:38.533
Damn him and his jet-black hair
and winning smile!

10:40.100 --> 10:42.467
Oh, I'm a failure!

10:42.467 --> 10:44.067
A failure!

10:44.067 --> 10:45.833
I'm so disorganized.

10:45.833 --> 10:48.900
I never call anyone back.

10:48.900 --> 10:52.067
You should see my car.
It's a mess!

10:52.067 --> 10:53.767
I'm a mess!

10:53.767 --> 10:55.867
I go to the submarine
sandwich restaurant,

10:55.867 --> 10:58.533
and I leave my submarine
sandwich restaurant value card

10:58.533 --> 11:01.900
at home every time.

11:01.900 --> 11:05.400
Oh, I want a free sandwich.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.767
[echoing]
Stamos!

11:09.200 --> 11:11.567
[sobbing]

11:11.567 --> 11:14.433
(Toots)
Now, I may be blind,

11:14.433 --> 11:15.767
but I still recognize

11:15.767 --> 11:18.500
the sound of my foster
granddaughter's laughter.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.433
[laughs]

11:20.433 --> 11:22.233
You hear a good pope joke
today at school, honey?

11:22.233 --> 11:24.900
No, Toots.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.700
I'd kind of like to be alone.

11:26.700 --> 11:30.200
Was it the one where two popes,
they walk into a bar, right,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.833
and Pius XXI says...

11:32.833 --> 11:33.900
he says--

11:33.900 --> 11:35.200
It's Abe.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.700
I really like him,
and I wanted him to like me,

11:37.700 --> 11:40.200
so I let him give me
a makeover,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.300
and look at me.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.600
Look at me!

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
I can't look at you, Joanie.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.533
I'm a blind man!

11:47.533 --> 11:49.333
But I can do something better.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.167
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:51.167 --> 11:52.167
- What?
- Hmm?

11:52.167 --> 11:53.167
Oh, please, God, no--

11:53.167 --> 11:54.333
Makeover!

[Joan sobbing]

12:10.533 --> 12:12.067
Oh, you don't need
to thank me, Joanie.

12:12.067 --> 12:14.700
Your joyful sobs of gratitude
are thanks enough.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.267
Well, I'm late
for a tennis match.

12:17.267 --> 12:18.667
[whistling]

12:18.667 --> 12:19.867
[Joan sobbing]

12:19.867 --> 12:21.800
Great. It's crying.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.167
Just leave me alone.

12:23.167 --> 12:24.533
Just leave
my boyfriend alone.

12:24.533 --> 12:26.800
[sobbing]

12:26.800 --> 12:28.867
Can you pass me my blush?

12:28.867 --> 12:29.900
Your what?

12:29.900 --> 12:31.567
The blush.

12:31.567 --> 12:32.867
It's makeup.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.467
You know, like what your mom
throws at you

12:34.467 --> 12:35.767
when the vodka runs out?

12:35.767 --> 12:38.900
I never had a mom, okay?

12:38.900 --> 12:41.300
Joan, I didn't know.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.733
[whispering]
I didn't know

12:43.733 --> 12:46.633
you didn't have a mom.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.867
Oh!

12:47.867 --> 12:50.067
For a second there,
I felt bad for you

12:50.067 --> 12:52.067
even though everything's
going great for me.

12:52.067 --> 12:53.100
Is that crazy?

12:53.100 --> 12:55.100
No, it's sympathy.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.933
You know,
I may regret this,

12:57.933 --> 13:01.067
but I have some old lipstick
I need to get rid of.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.767
You'd be doing me a favor

13:02.767 --> 13:04.767
if I could get rid of it
on your face.

13:04.767 --> 13:07.500
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:07.500 --> 13:08.967
- Makeover!
- Suicide!

Cleo, I haven't gotten around
to your prom-posal yet,

13:29.133 --> 13:31.633
but I found something
that I'm pretty sure

13:31.633 --> 13:34.467
you'll be just
as excited about.

13:34.467 --> 13:37.067
It's Emmett
from under the overpass!

13:37.067 --> 13:38.600
He's agreed to take Joan
to the prom

13:38.600 --> 13:40.300
in exchange
for some rubbing alcohol.

13:40.300 --> 13:43.267
The government's putting
fluoride in the tap water.

13:43.267 --> 13:45.467
Oh, I think
Joan's gonna get someone

13:45.467 --> 13:47.267
even better than Emmett, Abe.

13:47.267 --> 13:49.500
I just finished
giving her a makeover.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.733
She's about to make
her dramatic entry

13:51.733 --> 13:53.667
coming down the stairs.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.700
I present to you

14:07.700 --> 14:09.833

14:09.833 --> 14:11.367
new Joan of Arc!

[dramatic orchestral music]

14:25.800 --> 14:27.733
(Abe)
Joan?

14:27.733 --> 14:29.867
You look--

14:29.867 --> 14:32.200
Like a slutty
teenage beach whore.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.200
Yeah, I know.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.467
You guys, I don't need

14:34.467 --> 14:36.533
to pretend
to be someone else, you guys.

14:36.533 --> 14:38.933
No,

14:38.933 --> 14:41.533
you look like an angel.

14:41.533 --> 14:43.100
Do you like it?

14:43.100 --> 14:46.433
Like it?
This changes everything.

14:46.433 --> 14:49.967
Joan, would you please come...

14:49.967 --> 14:52.933
pile a list of guys
you'd like to go to prom with?

14:52.933 --> 14:55.267
I mean, now I could get you
a date with any guy in school,

14:55.267 --> 14:56.267
maybe even--

14:56.267 --> 14:58.667
Abe! I'm Cleopatra.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.633
So quit your stammering
and start your plannering,

15:01.633 --> 15:02.733
prom-posal-wise.

15:02.733 --> 15:04.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.567
But you got to admit,
Joan looks...

15:06.567 --> 15:07.733
I'm Cleopatra!

15:11.067 --> 15:12.567
Hot.

15:12.567 --> 15:14.333

Oh, ladies...

15:14.333 --> 15:19.200

Who is the fox?

15:21.833 --> 15:23.467
[women sighing]

15:23.467 --> 15:27.067
He's like a shorter,
browner Kennedy, mm.

15:27.067 --> 15:31.900
Don't, er, uh, damage
the merchandise, ladies.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.067
And by merchandise,

15:34.067 --> 15:36.100
I mean my junk!

15:37.233 --> 15:38.667
Hey, Gandhi.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.067
Um, I've been thinking
about prom,

15:41.067 --> 15:45.200
and that dry thing
sounds pretty keen.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.967
Well, this isn't easy, but--

15:46.967 --> 15:50.567
Oh, my God, GFK,
you are so taking me to prom.

15:50.567 --> 15:52.233

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, GFK.
Oh, GFK.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.867
Stamos!

16:04.867 --> 16:07.633
Why not me?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.867
I work so hard!

16:12.300 --> 16:17.700
Nobody knows...in here!

16:17.700 --> 16:20.333
I have so much love to give!

16:22.833 --> 16:25.767
[coughing and choking]

16:26.933 --> 16:29.600
I have an idea,

16:29.600 --> 16:34.067
an idea that can make you
as good as new.

16:34.067 --> 16:39.400
Are you programmed to be
thinking what I'm thinking?

16:39.400 --> 16:41.133
[together]
Makeover!

17:01.100 --> 17:04.967
All right, Cleo.
Here goes.

17:04.967 --> 17:06.833
Cleopatra Smith,

17:06.833 --> 17:09.167
will you
go to the prom with me?

17:09.167 --> 17:10.500
Yes, Abe.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.067
I, Joan, would love
to go to prom with you.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.167

17:23.800 --> 17:25.067
[panting]

17:25.067 --> 17:26.900
It was all a dream?

17:26.900 --> 17:29.333
But what does it mean?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.400
[gasps]

17:33.967 --> 17:36.667
[both laughing]

17:36.667 --> 17:39.933
Oh, GFK, we've had
some good times.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.600
Like the time
I bet I could get

17:41.600 --> 17:44.100
that pathetic Gandhi
a prom date.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.633
[both laugh]

17:45.633 --> 17:46.633
What?

17:46.633 --> 17:48.700
Er, uh--er, uh--uh--

17:48.700 --> 17:50.767
Tell me I was a bet!

17:50.767 --> 17:52.067
Tell me!

17:52.067 --> 17:53.067
Look, champ,

17:53.067 --> 17:54.567
it started as a bet,

17:54.567 --> 17:56.800
but then I warmed to you,
you knucklehead.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.433
Hey, you want
one of my prom dates?

17:58.433 --> 17:59.433
Have a Bronte.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.667
Forget it.

18:00.667 --> 18:04.333
I am, er, uh,
no longah GFK.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.133
My name is Gandhi.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.500
Holy crap, Gandhi,
forget about prom.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.067
Ciao.

18:18.067 --> 18:21.867
You know what JFK
stands for in my book?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.900
Just feigning kindness.

18:25.867 --> 18:28.233
He's got you pegged, Kennedy.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.767
He's got you pegged.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.100
Oh sure, now you talk.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.567
But when I needed you,
you clammed up on me.

18:33.567 --> 18:36.433
Well, if you're gonna lash out
at me like that,

18:36.433 --> 18:39.333
maybe you should just leave.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.067
I'm not leaving till you are.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.067
What a wonderful outfit!

18:49.067 --> 18:52.233
Why, this cravat alone
would look great with jeans.

18:52.233 --> 18:55.633
And it draws the eye away from
how incredibly low-waisted I am.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.633
Yeah.

18:57.633 --> 19:00.467
Oh, I feel like a king,

19:00.467 --> 19:04.767
the kind of king that would
reign over this year's prom.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.900
That gives me an idea,

19:06.900 --> 19:10.200
a Stamos-neutralizing idea.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.300
[laughing]

19:12.300 --> 19:16.967
Oh, nothing can destroy
this happy mood I'm in.

19:16.967 --> 19:18.467
Scudworth.

19:18.467 --> 19:20.233
I'm looking
at a certain videotape here

19:20.233 --> 19:22.900
called Cloney Island:
My Plan to Steal the Clones

19:22.900 --> 19:25.267
Away From the Shadowy Board:
The Movie.

19:25.267 --> 19:27.167
I've never heard of it.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.800
Scudworth, we're going
to take the clones away

19:29.800 --> 19:31.667
and terminate you...

19:31.667 --> 19:33.233
on prom night.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.833
Ah! Ah!

19:35.833 --> 19:37.733
Oh, oh!

19:37.733 --> 19:39.100
Ooh!

19:39.100 --> 19:40.367
[dull thud]

19:43.233 --> 19:45.067
Marie. Marie.

19:45.067 --> 19:48.433
Oh, I'm so glad I found you.

19:48.433 --> 19:51.267
I'm sorry I've been
such a jerk lately.

19:51.267 --> 19:55.867
And I wanted to know,
if it's not too late...

19:55.867 --> 19:58.600
will you go to the prom
with me?

19:58.600 --> 20:00.033
- Yes...
- Oh, thank God.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.533
Terday
I would have said yes.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.300
But now I know
what an ass you are,

20:04.300 --> 20:06.733
so today my answer is no.

20:06.733 --> 20:10.600
I already have a date--
Rock Hudson.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.833
He really knows
how to treat a lady.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.967
Now I'll have to go...

20:15.967 --> 20:20.300
staaaaag!

20:22.100 --> 20:23.567
All right.

20:23.567 --> 20:27.167
I know this isn't a fancy
or elaborate proposal,

20:27.167 --> 20:29.767
but...

20:29.767 --> 20:32.867
you've always been
the one for me.

20:32.867 --> 20:36.867
You're my friend
and so much more.

20:36.867 --> 20:40.533
So I'm gonna ask you to the prom
by saying the words,

20:40.533 --> 20:43.033
"Will you go
to the prom with me?"

20:43.033 --> 20:45.633
followed by your name.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.067
Ready?

20:47.067 --> 20:49.300
Okay.

20:49.300 --> 20:54.433
Will you go to the prom
with me...

20:54.433 --> 20:55.367
Jo-Cle--

it if they try *
