00:08.875 --> 00:10.477
Welcome to another episode
of "The Dude Perfect Show."

00:10.543 --> 00:13.380
Here at Dude Perfect, we've done
just about every basketball shot

00:13.446 --> 00:14.614
there is.
- Tried to.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.417
- World's longest,
off the building.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.053
Longest blindfolded.
- ALL: [cheering]

00:20.120 --> 00:21.621

- Off the head.

00:21.688 --> 00:22.922
We've done off the head.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.958
We've done just about every shot
there is to be made.

00:25.024 --> 00:28.728
Other than the world's
largest basketball shot.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.231
- And we, together, are gonna
try to push it off the building.

00:31.297 --> 00:32.665
- That's what
we're doing today.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.634
Let's go do it!

Alright, guys, so in preparation

00:59.092 --> 01:00.860
for the world's
largest basketball shot,

01:00.927 --> 01:02.796
we've got Cody and Garrett
starting to build

01:02.862 --> 01:06.433
our mini large basketball so we
can test it here at the office.

01:06.499 --> 01:09.035
Over here, I believe we've got
Cody and Cory

01:09.102 --> 01:11.204
actually getting our rim
out for practice.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.072
We're gonna
go up top to the mezzanine,

01:13.139 --> 01:16.976
try to throw our big ball
off the top, see how it goes.

01:17.043 --> 01:18.011
I think right in there.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.446
Maybe a little bit closer.

01:19.512 --> 01:21.681
We're trying to make
a huge basketball shot.

01:21.748 --> 01:26.586
I'm talking the biggest ball,
monster rim off a huge drop-off.

01:26.653 --> 01:27.654
First things first though,

01:27.720 --> 01:29.022
we gotta test it
on a small scale,

01:29.088 --> 01:30.557
make sure this actually works.

01:30.623 --> 01:31.891
Okay.

01:31.958 --> 01:32.826
What are we looking at?

01:32.892 --> 01:33.893
- Three feet.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.495
- We gotta go three
times this big?

01:35.562 --> 01:37.664
- This is a good test.
It's a good start.

01:37.730 --> 01:38.865
- Does it roll?

01:38.932 --> 01:40.767
- Yeah, it rolls, it's a ball.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.035
- Treat it with
tender loving care.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.636
- Guys think I can
carry it by myself?

01:43.703 --> 01:45.839
- I wouldn't advice it.
- Here, I'll give it a go.

01:45.905 --> 01:48.541
- Hold it over your head.
- Hold the world, Mr. Universe.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.609
- Don't drop it.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.611
- And I think he does--
- Please don't--

01:51.678 --> 01:53.046
- Hey!
- Sorry.

01:53.112 --> 01:55.615
- Are you losing your mind?
- Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.950
- I think it's a two-man job.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.785
- But if we break it,
it's not on us.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.753
- Yes, it is.
It's all on you.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.255
- Do we want the rim
right there?

02:02.322 --> 02:03.556
Is that where we're going?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.259
- We're not moving, so make sure
your aim is true.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.061
- Hey, do we seem
in the middle to y'all?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.294
- Are you kidding?

02:09.362 --> 02:11.030
You can't tell where you're at?
- It's tough.

02:11.097 --> 02:12.732
- No, it's not.
- Oh my gosh.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.833
I'm bracing for impact.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.069
- Alright, I'm ready.
- Shot the ball!

02:16.135 --> 02:19.305
- This is the world's largest
practice basketball shot!

02:19.372 --> 02:20.306
- Time out!

02:20.373 --> 02:21.641
Technically,
it's a miniature version

02:21.708 --> 02:24.677
of the world's largest
practice basketball shot.

held up quite nicely.

02:42.595 --> 02:44.364
We just gotta build everything
three times bigger.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.232
- I agree.
- Alright, good job, boys.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.234
- That was fun.
- Nice one.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.109

03:06.753 --> 03:09.188

a huge basketball.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.456
- Where did you get this?

03:10.523 --> 03:11.991
- I missed that column
right there.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.493
- That is huge.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.695
- This is the world's
largest basketball.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.996
It's nine feet tall,

03:17.063 --> 03:19.732
which means
our rim's gotta be 18 feet wide.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.834
It's gonna be launched off
a ten-story building,

03:21.901 --> 03:23.002
which is huge.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.038
- I don't know if we can
pick it up though.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.211
We picked it up.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.080
- It's on my back.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.381
- Okay.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.183
- Good news, we can pick it up.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.052
Bad news, it's gonna be tough
to get this

03:39.118 --> 03:40.353
to the top
of a ten-story building.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.188
But I think I got
something for that.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.324
First things first,
let's spread out this net.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.859
Everybody get a corner,
spread this out.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.361
Here's the plan.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.530
We're gonna attach the rope
to the net, take the other end,

03:50.597 --> 03:52.999
put it through the rafter,
attach that to the golf cart.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.467
Simple pulley system.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.935
Take her out.
- Alright, Cods!

03:56.002 --> 03:57.937
- Ready?
- Take it to the top!

03:58.004 --> 04:00.506
Go, Cods, go!

Go, Cods!

04:01.741 --> 04:03.576
- ALL: Oh!

04:03.643 --> 04:06.179
- We did learn that the net is
strong enough to carry the ball.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.413
- The rope was our failure.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.549
- What if you just
pulled it up with a tractor?

04:09.616 --> 04:11.818
- No, we need something that's
got a litle bit more oomph.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.186
- Helicopter.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.488
- Helicopter's not gonna work.
- I got it. I got it, T.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.589
Crane.
- No, I don't think so.

04:17.656 --> 04:20.026
It needs to be
something--oh, I know.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.962
Dude, we use a crane.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.831
- It's brilliant.
- A crane to pull it up.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.500
We just attach the crane
to the top of the ball, pull up.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.069
You know what I'm saying?
- Are you serious right now?

04:30.136 --> 04:32.205
- How did we not
think of that sooner?

04:32.271 --> 04:33.873
- How does your mind
work like that?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.342
- It's just like ideas hit me,
and sometimes I don't even know

You move too fast, it'll snatch.

gotta go kinda easy.

You can walk regular, but just
don't try to move too fast,

- I think we should
knuckleball it.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.532
- The ball is on the roof,
which is a good sign.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.700
We're making progress.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.335
- We're gonna stand
far from the goal.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.837
- Yeah. Yeah, there's no upside
to being close.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.605
- No. You don't
wanna mess that up.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.407
- You don't wanna be the guy
to get squashed

07:54.473 --> 07:55.741
by a giant basketball.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.677
- This is a lot bigger
than I remembered.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.312
- Are you sure
you got enough power?

07:59.378 --> 08:01.314
- I think we need
to juice up the power meter.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.382
- Dude.
- This is exciting.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.550
- I think we're good.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.818
- Okay, I disagree.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.420
I think we're gonna
miss to the left.

Right here, that's good.

- What are you doing?

08:58.704 --> 09:01.040
- They had to dive
into the bushes.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.441
- No way.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.510
- That hits me on the head,
that's a spine breaker.

blowing down there?

09:06.545 --> 09:09.115
- From up here,
it's going that way.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.483

The exact opposite.

it was gonna roll in.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.299

have to throw it still hard

10:00.366 --> 10:02.134
