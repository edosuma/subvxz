monsters is something else.

15:59.793 --> 16:00.794
Oh, "Monsters," is it?

16:00.878 --> 16:01.962
Oh, come on. I didn't mean that.
What I meant was...

16:02.046 --> 16:03.672
"Monsters"? You're calling me a monster?

16:03.756 --> 16:05.424
You're palling around with the fellow
who killed your daddy.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.551
I'm not palling around with anyone.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.386
I will deal with Jody soon enough.

16:09.470 --> 16:11.013
In the meantime, you have to go.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.097
Listen to me.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.975
I'm not leaving without Tulip,

20:21.972 --> 20:26.476
Bit of a setback, but I got him sewed

lifted the restraining order.

21:34.211 --> 21:36.421
We watched the first couple of scenes
of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>

21:36.505 --> 21:41.426
a couple of times, and the plan
was to construct all day Sunday.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.553
I put my boy to bed around 9:00,

21:43.762 --> 21:48.600
and I figured one little whiff
just to settle the nerves.

21:48.976 --> 21:53.271
And I woke up on the floor,
and my boy was standing over me

21:55.273 --> 21:58.193
with a look of disgust in his eyes.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.363

That took courage.

22:25.971 --> 22:29.975
Though hearing your story
really brought back my own demons.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.686
You huff glue, Father?

22:33.645 --> 22:37.774

Sorry, no offense, Father,

22:58.795 --> 23:00.005
but I don't really believe all...

23:00.088 --> 23:01.089
No.

No, that place closed years ago.

23:11.183 --> 23:12.517
No, it's open again.

23:14.770 --> 23:17.147

- Tell me the Tombs are open again?
- No. Not the Tombs.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.449
No, but if you're looking
for a clean, sober spell,

23:27.532 --> 23:29.659

across from the riverboat casino.

driving me around?

for the same old lady?

Well,

get my head around it.

I bet he could shed some light.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.718
I can sure try.

25:52.677 --> 25:55.430
What exactly is the deal
with those squeezy napkin things?

25:55.639 --> 25:57.349
Those are blood-debt compacts.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.227
A compact. Sort of like a contract?

26:00.602 --> 26:04.731
Yeah. It's a solemn exchange
of promises between parties.

Oh, my gosh, it's so interesting.

26:15.242 --> 26:17.661
I bet she's got hundreds
of those napkins.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.291
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.711
So, there's no way out of a compact?

26:27.587 --> 26:30.590
Sure there is. You pay off the debt.
(CHUCKLES)

26:30.966 --> 26:33.593

of the napkin, right?

26:33.760 --> 26:34.803
