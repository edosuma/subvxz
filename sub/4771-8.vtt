00:04.640 --> 00:06.210
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.400 --> 00:08.880
Tell me right now
what happened to Holly Weaver.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.880
Tell me right now
or I'm gonna walk out of here

00:10.920 --> 00:12.490
and you're never
gonna see me again.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.640
Angela ain't got proof
of who we are or what we do.

00:14.665 --> 00:16.361
Trust me. I got a plan.
It'll all work out.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.887
I trust you.
It's her I don't trust.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.241
We got a problem with Tommy.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.880
I think he's gonna try
to kill Angela.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.691
It turns out that Lobos's
long-running dispute

00:24.840 --> 00:27.002
with the Jimenez Cartel in Mexico
has turned deadly

00:27.160 --> 00:28.491
and Lobos is on the move.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.450
Jefe hasn't given me
any details.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.331
But when I know, you know.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.562
I plan to hold you to that.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.010

Why'd you stop?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.811
I was almost there.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.368
- I needed to catch my breath.
- Of course you did.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.204
New York is not safe anymore.

03:50.040 --> 03:53.408
I'm going to get my money
from Ghost

03:53.560 --> 03:55.562
and I'm gonna get out.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.887
Thank you.
We need to talk about the kids.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.882
You change the combination?

04:09.280 --> 04:13.490
Raina has a recital on the 30th.
Can you make it?

04:13.640 --> 04:15.563
I'll try, but it shouldn't be
a problem.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.084
Tariq needs work
on his jump shot.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.279
Told him I'm gonna take him
to the park on Saturday,

04:19.305 --> 04:21.201
- so it should be cool.
- All right. That works.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.482
And Yas has her checkup

04:23.640 --> 04:26.564
- with the pediatrician on Wednesday.
- On Wednesday.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.324
I got your text.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.561
You didn't write back.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.485
<i>Sorry.</i>

04:32.640 --> 04:35.291
So, Tasha, I'll take the kids to dinner
sometime this week.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.091
You pick the night, all right?

04:38.240 --> 04:40.561
Have a good day.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.322
I want the plan, Ghost.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.962
I stopped Tommy from killing Angela
because you said you had a plan.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.160
If you want me to trust you,
you better know

04:54.185 --> 04:55.985
it ain't gonna be in blind faith.
Not anymore.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.764
Angela told me her investigation
is actually not about Tommy,

05:01.920 --> 05:05.129
or me, for that matter.
She wants Lobos.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.448
That ain't good news.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.364
Lobos is the connect.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.126
If she gets him,
then our whole thing goes down.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.930
But she got to get him first.

05:17.440 --> 05:21.490
I was thinking...
What if we take away the option?

05:22.960 --> 05:26.123
No Lobos, no investigation.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.806
And Lobos is here now.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.123
What if I could
convince him to disappear?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.123
Or...

05:37.520 --> 05:39.841
you make him disappear.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.011
If I kill Lobos, Tasha,
there goes our connect.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.487
So you get another one.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.688
The blowback could be huge.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.646
Only if you get caught.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.730
And for the sake of our children,
you will not get caught.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.608
You're damn right
I won't get caught.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.682
So... Angela still doesn't know
about you?

06:23.440 --> 06:25.044
Are you sure?

06:26.160 --> 06:29.846
Yeah. I'm sure.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.730
- So what do I have to do?
- Nothing.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.800
I already programmed
the information on his phone

06:36.825 --> 06:38.842
into a mobile monitoring system
on the green one.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.566
All the information on his phone
will be viewed here,

06:41.720 --> 06:43.927
which means you'll be able
to read his text messages,

06:44.080 --> 06:46.447
view his incoming
and outgoing call logs.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.887
So I can see who he calls
and who calls him?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.202
Can I hear him talk, though?

06:51.360 --> 06:53.203
Only the NSA can do that.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.727
Think of this more as a mirror.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.360
Whatever pops up on his phone
will appear on this.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.563
The money.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.041
Surveillance breeds suspicion,
doesn't it?

07:11.320 --> 07:13.243
Cool.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.249
You know, I have done this
for a lot of wives.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.971
They think they want to know
what their man is up to,

07:24.120 --> 07:26.248
but then once they find out,

07:26.400 --> 07:27.845
they have second thoughts.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.004
I'm just saying, no refunds.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.561
Gotcha.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.005
"The spot"?

07:53.960 --> 07:57.123
Julito. How we looking, man?

07:57.280 --> 08:00.124
Money's coming in from the primeras
and the boutiques, boss.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.760
Shit. We locked, loaded
and ready to fly on this bitch.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.689
Dios fucking mio.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.047
Good job.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.004
God damn!

08:13.160 --> 08:16.130
J, you got this shit looking
like the fucking US Mint.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.282
Now that's some good work, son.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.167
What's up, Tommy?

08:25.720 --> 08:27.802
Well, looks like
we all good here.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.721
Let me know when you hear from Lobos
so we can make this fucking drop.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.246
Hey, man.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.370
Tasha told me she hooked you up
with a wild night.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.211
It wasn't the night
I had planned.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.567
Tommy, I told you I had
Angela under control.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.848
I said, man, I got a plan.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.205
Angela told me
what task force she's on.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.004
They ain't looking for us.
They want Lobos.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.401
And we're supposed
to get him that money

09:04.600 --> 09:06.170
while she's trying to arrest him?

09:06.320 --> 09:08.561
She doesn't know
he's in town, man.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.848
But I was thinking,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.207
maybe she should.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.687
What I mean is if she
follows Lobos long enough

09:15.840 --> 09:19.242
and she gets him, then it's gonna
lead her to us anyway.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.688
Well, hell, what if we just give her
what she wants?

09:22.840 --> 09:24.365
Flip on Lobos?

09:24.520 --> 09:27.205
You been dipping
in the goddamn product?

09:27.360 --> 09:31.126
Tommy, not flip on him,
kill him.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.203
You out of your
motherfucking mind.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.600
His guard's down, man.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.609
He came to town to get
his money and leave.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.040
He's got all kind of motherfuckers
chasing him in Mexico.

09:39.065 --> 09:40.365
You know that.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.046
There might not be
a better shot at this, brother.

09:44.080 --> 09:49.041
I say... we walk him
in the drop,

09:49.200 --> 09:51.043
we give him his money,

09:51.200 --> 09:54.761
that crazy motherfucker's happy.
He leaves, goes to his hotel.

09:54.920 --> 09:59.084
We follow him to his hotel.
We fucking do him quick, man.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.248
Make it look like
it was someone else.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.129
- Like that Serb shit.
- Serbs.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.727
And then we're done. We're done.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.882
No more worrying about Lobos.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.242
No more looking over our shoulder
for the fucking FBI.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.085
Looking over our shoulder
for the cops or the competition?

10:14.240 --> 10:17.164
That's this game, Ghost.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.164
We worked hard for this shit.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.403
We deliver
a dead Lobos to Angela,

10:23.600 --> 10:26.251
she goes away. Great.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.971
But then where the fuck
do we go for our shit?

10:29.120 --> 10:31.009
And don't you say Milan,
'cause I ain't fuckin'

10:31.160 --> 10:33.606
with that cannibal motherfucker.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.449
Maybe we don't need
another one, man.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.967
I got enough money, Tommy.
You got enough money.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.602
Maybe we split the cash in there
right down the fucking middle.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.207
And then you and me are set,
partner. We're set.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.001
- And there it is.
- There it fucking is.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.606
Get out the life.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.003
Somehow I knew this
was gonna lead back there.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.128
We ain't getting
out the life, Ghost.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.963
We ain't never gonna kill Lobos.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.521
We gonna deal with Angela...

11:07.120 --> 11:09.168
one way or another.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.120
And then we're gonna go back
to fucking business.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.167
Ma, I thought you'd be at work.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.483
You know, you've been
coming in late a lot of nights.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.722
Like 2:00 and 3:00
in the morning.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.406
If I was still at school, you
wouldn't know what I was doing.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.848
You know, a lot of things have changed
since your father got out.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.923
What kind of stuff
he got you doing at night?

11:38.080 --> 11:40.845
- I ain't corrupting the little nigga.
- Surprised to see you here.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.490
Had some business
to take care of.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.489
Which means your cell phone
didn't work?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.920
Let me guess, they didn't have
a landline where you were?

11:46.945 --> 11:48.840
- I'm back now.
- Yeah, 'cause Dre called you.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.729
No, because you called me.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.929
You said Ghost was asking about me.
Well, here I am in the flesh.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.923
And hungry as shit.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.003
I'll make you something.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.367
But you can't stay long.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.690
Now, I'm gonna need you
to tell me

12:05.840 --> 12:08.002
everything your uncle been doing
since I've been gone.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.042
Now, what you know
about his connect Lobos?

12:12.200 --> 12:14.407
Not much.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.528
Then find out.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.640
How you be right there
and you don't know nothing?

12:24.200 --> 12:26.726
How are you?

12:30.080 --> 12:32.970
Need about a day or two
to come up with the money, jefe.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.203
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

12:36.400 --> 12:38.801
I just want to talk.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.042
Me and you.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.402
"EPIA on Madison"?

13:14.080 --> 13:17.004
"628 Mad EPIA."

13:21.920 --> 13:23.524
EPIA.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.648
E-P-I-A.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.848
E-P-I-A, E-P-I-A.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.482
EPIA... E-P-I-A.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.967
"Wait for further
instructions." Fuck.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.605
Hey, babe. How are you?

13:48.800 --> 13:52.441
I'm fine. How's your day so far?

13:52.640 --> 13:54.688
I'm hustling as usual.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.047
Hadn't heard from you.
I was starting to wonder.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.804
No, no, I'm good.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.487
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.529
Where are you right now?

14:06.480 --> 14:09.689
I'm at Truth.
There's a party at the club.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.968
Prepping for it.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.570
Six and a half.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.529
I don't want to disturb you.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.762
I'll let you get back to work.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.600
You know,
you're never interrupting me.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.251
You know I'm never
too busy to talk to you.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.887
- Someone left this card for you.
- Okay.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.690
Ange, you there?

14:57.840 --> 14:59.968
I got to go, Jamie.
I got a staff meeting.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.408
Okay, well, you have
a most fantastic day, Miss Valdes.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.040
You, too, Mr. St. Patrick.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.730
Jefe.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.242
That's a very nice... jacket.

15:32.480 --> 15:37.407
Ghost, I want you to take on
more responsibility.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.083
Lo siento,
pero I don't understand.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.730
Okay.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.002
I need to be unreachable.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.128
Undetectable?

15:47.280 --> 15:51.285
Invisible so I can stay
invincible.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.324
Jefe, I can't run a Mexican
drug cartel from New York City.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.244
No, no, no, no, no. I know.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.163
I have men in Mexico

16:01.320 --> 16:03.800
that take care of the supply.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.760
But this business of coming here
to see my distributor,

16:07.920 --> 16:10.764
I can't. I'm... I'm too exposed.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.166
I have a man in California,
I have a man in Texas,

16:15.320 --> 16:16.970
and I have you here in New York.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.529
I want you to oversee them.
I want them to report to you.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.804
You want to decrease your risk
while you increase mine, jefe.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.965
And increase your bank account.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.644
He is dead weight.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.724
I don't mean any disrespect,
but I'm gonna be honest.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.566
Your attachment to him
is holding you back.

17:04.319 --> 17:07.243
Pero, you understand
I need a few days to consider.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.640
Of course.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.849
Can I give you the answer when I...
When I deliver your money?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.170
Very well.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.842
Be well, jefe.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.042
Be well, Ghost.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.410
He's not interested
in power or money.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.211
He's not interested in anything
that I could give him.

17:59.720 --> 18:04.282
Which means that I can't control him,
which means that he's a liability.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.441
He's such a dreamer?

18:19.240 --> 18:21.129
Could I have a Shirley Temple?

18:21.280 --> 18:24.568
According to the Federals, Lobos
plans to meet with his distributors,

18:24.720 --> 18:27.246
Tommy Egan, at a warehouse
on 11th Avenue.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.243
They probably chose
that location

18:29.400 --> 18:31.440
because it has quick access
to the West Side Highway

18:31.465 --> 18:34.569
and to the Hudson
plus multiple exits and entrances.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.927
- We'll need helos and vessels...
- What'd I miss?

18:37.080 --> 18:40.607
Federals got intel that Lobos
is planning on meeting his distributor

18:40.800 --> 18:43.087
tomorrow at 1:00 in a warehouse
on the West Side.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.323
So we need every roof,
window, and door covered

18:46.520 --> 18:49.922
until tactical enters the access point
and secures Lobos.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.764
How do we know the info's legit?

18:51.920 --> 18:54.605
We don't.
And there's been no sight of Egan.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.161
We've got units outside
his place and his mother's.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.089
This is the only lead
we have right now.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.442
When we arrest Lobos,
we want to make sure

19:01.600 --> 19:03.762
we bring him in alive
if possible.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.651
I'm sorry, what charges
are we arresting him on exactly?

19:06.800 --> 19:09.610
If you had been here on time,
you would have heard us say

19:09.760 --> 19:11.683
they were hoping to catch
Lobos and Egan

19:11.840 --> 19:13.330
in the commission of a crime...

19:13.480 --> 19:16.450
Exchanging drugs,
money, or weapons.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.444
One thing's for sure. Lobos
and his men will be armed and evasive.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.000
We'll need
additional ground support

19:21.120 --> 19:22.880
to make sure no one
slips through the cracks.

19:22.905 --> 19:24.125
I'll put that call in as well.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.680
Great, we'll reconvene
here tomorrow

19:25.800 --> 19:27.689
with team leaders
to map out a battle plan.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.330
Questions?

19:38.120 --> 19:40.964
Yeah, you see it, nigga.
Outfitted as a motherfucker.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.010
I see you decided to join
the 21st century and shit, man.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.362
Yeah, I told you about
fucking with that swine.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.040
Come on, man, don't come over here
with that Farrakhan bullshit.

19:49.065 --> 19:51.875
I'm just trying to keep
your uncivilized ass alive.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.564
Hey, I heard that nigga Ghost
was asking about me while I was gone.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.404
Told you he was spooked.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.881
Can't even tell, man.

20:02.040 --> 20:05.249
He rode up on me on the corner,
starting asking what I wanted long term.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.721
What, like if you wanted
to get out the hood?

20:07.880 --> 20:11.601
Motherfuckers like Ghost always trying
to create copies of themselves.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.842
Want to make another nigga
be like him and shit.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.047
Let me hit that.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.726
Come on. Come on.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.602
Go to him. See if he'll tell you
when he's supposed to meet Lobos.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.569
- Okay.
- See if he'll take you with him.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.882
I'm gonna go to Tommy,
I'll work that angle.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.684
- Okay.
- If he know something,

20:32.840 --> 20:35.241
- he gonna tell me.
- Okay.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.562
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's one other thing.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.371
So I did a solid for that Puerto Rican
motherfucker Vibora, right?

20:40.520 --> 20:43.285
After I did it,
he came with a offer

20:43.440 --> 20:45.044
about falling back
on Ghost and Tommy.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.884
- No shit?
- Real shit.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.803
Ghost and Tommy got a revolt
going on their hands, man.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.724
You think we should tell them?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.281
Hell, no.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.801
Right now we three moves
ahead of Ghost.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.486
Right where we want to be.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.086
Just a minute.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.687
Hey, Jamie.
This is a nice surprise.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.603
I have something for you.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.603
Seriously?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.091
Yes.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.089
Get in here.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.170
- You.
- You.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.127
Come on. Open it.
Open it. Open it.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.762
- You really didn't need to do this.
- Yes, I did.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.647
I told you to stop
buying me things.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.446
Okay. I was disobedient.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.202
These just looked
so much like you.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.648
- They're gorgeous.
- Like you.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.724
Thank you.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.008
Put them on.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.286
Come on, put them on.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.209
I don't really think they go

22:21.400 --> 22:23.402
with this awesomeness
that I'm wearing.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.409
Okay.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.324
Mind if I return this text real quick?

22:29.480 --> 22:31.562
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.531
You know, I'm gonna go look
for something to go with these shoes.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.364
Make it a big reveal.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.329
Okay.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.444
Jamie, I can't find anything
to wear with these shoes.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.286
Come on, Ange.
You got to have something...

23:26.280 --> 23:28.681
You see, that works.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.208
With the exception
of one or two slackers,

23:35.360 --> 23:37.124
everyone else came through
with their cheese.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.203
So y'all just sitting on it?

23:39.360 --> 23:42.204
Like I said, we need a couple
more drops to make the total.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.567
Hand it over to Lobos,
back to business.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.210
When you supposed to meet him?

23:46.400 --> 23:47.925
Tomorrow, thank God.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.401
I hate having a house full of money
and nowhere to put it.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.881
I can think
of someplace to put it.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.281
Don't get any fucking ideas, K.
I'm serious.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.807
You know, it's good
to have you back, man.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.766
Long way from home, boy.
How'd you find me?

24:14.120 --> 24:18.250
So he's back?
Kanan told you where I was.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.006
Yeah, he mentioned it.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.084
But I'm not here for him,
though.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.484
I thought about what you said, man...
about getting out the hood?

24:29.840 --> 24:32.081
I asked Kanan about getting out.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.645
He laughed.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.800
I'll bet he did.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.167
Look, man, I don't want to be
on the corner forever.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.642
I'm listening.

24:52.480 --> 24:56.121
What's up with your boy, Ruiz?
He loyal?

24:56.280 --> 24:59.124
Ruiz wants to be
more big time than he is.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.284
A few months ago, he actually
reached out to Lobos

25:02.440 --> 25:04.080
and tried to make a play
behind our backs.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.804
And the motherfucker
is still alive?

25:05.960 --> 25:07.644
We checked him.
I mean, I didn't trust him,

25:07.800 --> 25:10.963
but he's actually a valuable part
of our whole operation.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.728
Thanks, Tiny.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.684
She ain't been tiny in a minute.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.808
Speaking of moving weight,

25:21.960 --> 25:24.247
I ain't never dropped
this much money off on a connect.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.323
Where y'all supposed
to meet him at?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.600
I don't know. He's supposed
to text Ghost with a spot.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.325
Well, why don't I come with you?

25:32.480 --> 25:36.485
Back you up
in case this shit don't go right?

25:36.680 --> 25:38.364
You said
the motherfucker was crazy.

25:38.520 --> 25:42.241
Serious shit, but...
I think we're cool.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.321
So I was thinking maybe
I could work directly for you.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.841
I mean, you...

25:51.000 --> 25:53.367
You could tell me, you know,

25:53.520 --> 25:56.171
if you got something
I could watch, just let me know.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.690
I know connect's in town.
Heard that motherfucker's crazy.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.049
Yeah, he's crazy.
Don't want you anywhere near him.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.043
I ain't interested
in getting you shot.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.884
You got a daughter
to raise, right?

26:08.080 --> 26:10.924
Get back to your crib safe, man.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.686
Good to see you.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.970
What's he want, Uncle G?

26:24.120 --> 26:26.726
I don't know yet, Shawn.
But as long as he's around,

26:26.880 --> 26:28.803
keep your head
on a swivel, all right?

26:28.960 --> 26:30.962
Let's be out.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.721
Haven't seen you in a while.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.040
Is that another one of those
that only he can sign for?

26:43.065 --> 26:45.406
That's right,
only Mr. Proctor can sign for it.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.086
Can you let him know I'm here?

26:48.240 --> 26:51.323
Can you please get Brian, Mickey,
and those other assholes on the phone?

26:51.480 --> 26:53.960
Mr. Proctor. I have another one
of these packages for you.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.851
Should I come in?

26:59.480 --> 27:00.925
You haven't returned
my phone calls.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.242
I've been very busy.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.200
See, I don't give a fuck
how busy you've been.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.169
All I care about is that
you have the 12 grand

27:07.320 --> 27:09.440
you been promising to pay us
for the last three weeks.

27:09.465 --> 27:11.447
Okay, look, you know me.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.125
I'm good for it.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.930
But I can't afford
to pay you right now.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.809
What exactly you think
happens next here?

27:16.960 --> 27:19.281
I'm guessing some sort
of physical pain, right?

27:19.440 --> 27:21.283
But here's the thing.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.761
I'm a white lawyer
in a Wall Street office

27:23.920 --> 27:25.684
and you are
a Puerto Rican drug dealer.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.171
I'm Cuban, you dumb fuck.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.051
The point is, you're not
gonna hit me. Not in here.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.965
There's too many witnesses.
You're too smart for that.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.043
Look, I'm not running.
I'm not ducking.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.850
I'll pay you when I can pay you.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.048
Yeah?

27:39.200 --> 27:41.680
Everyone's on line one. Pick up.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.450
All right, who's gonna be a hero
and save my client?

27:49.840 --> 27:52.810
Don't be a douchebag
your whole life.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.849
"C-R-L-T-N."

28:13.040 --> 28:17.489
540 Ma-na-na.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.324
12:00.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.322
540 Manana.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.244
New York.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.003
"C-R-L-T."

28:47.360 --> 28:51.126
C-R-L-T-N New York.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.851
The Carlton Hotel.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.522
Mañana.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.604
Room 540.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.882
Tomorrow.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.929
Noon.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.407
Greg?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.205
Yeah?

29:22.400 --> 29:24.243
What time did Mike say
that Lobos meeting was?

29:24.400 --> 29:26.801
Tomorrow at 1:00
at the warehouse on 11th Ave.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.724
Why?

29:30.240 --> 29:32.242
- You got something?
- No.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.606
Okay.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.728
Greg, what if
the Federals are wrong

29:35.880 --> 29:38.167
and when we go to the warehouse,
Lobos isn't there?

29:38.320 --> 29:41.403
Well, then
we'll just keep looking for him

29:41.560 --> 29:44.291
at the great expense
of the taxpayers.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.410
Don't worry, Angela.
The Federals, they got it right.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.403
We're gonna get Lobos tomorrow.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.602
I don't want to smoke a blunt

30:04.760 --> 30:07.081
in the middle of the day
and be high all goddamn afternoon.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.930
Plus I got to pick up
the kids later.

30:09.080 --> 30:12.129
You need to lay off that shit
your damn self.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.282
So what's up with
the 911 text, Tommy?

30:14.440 --> 30:16.602
Ghost lost his goddamn mind.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.366
First he sends you to stop me
from killing Angela.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.444
Now he wants to kill
Lobos instead.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.126
I mean, are you sure
that's such a bad idea?

30:25.280 --> 30:28.363
It's not like he's the most predictable
motherfucker to work for.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.443
Yes, T, I'm sure
that's a bad idea.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.560
First of all, he'd probably
see it coming anyway.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.842
Motherfucker's got eyes
in the back of his head.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.810
But second, we're supposed to meet up
with him at the Carlton tomorrow.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.800
Now, I know firsthand
it's damn near impossible

30:39.950 --> 30:41.270
to get out that place
with a body.

30:41.310 --> 30:42.963
But that's not what matters.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.440
What are we supposed to do
about a connect after he's dead?

30:45.465 --> 30:47.043
Tommy,
we'll find another connect.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.810
At this quality?
At this kind of weight?

30:48.960 --> 30:50.405
It's not that fucking easy.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.483
But that's why
Ghost ain't stressing.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.847
'Cause he wants out.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.210
I thought he was over that.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.203
Not even. He brought it up
again yesterday.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.482
You don't think...

31:06.640 --> 31:09.644
You don't think he's trying
to run away with the Fed bitch?

31:12.480 --> 31:16.326
A dead Lobos mean
she and Ghost get away clean

31:16.480 --> 31:18.005
without anyone
chasing after them.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.605
T, you're tripping.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.524
Ghost would never run.
Not without the kids.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.365
The old Ghost, you're right.
But this nigga now?

31:24.520 --> 31:26.921
I'm not sure
what the fuck he'll do next.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.887
What are you doing here?

31:37.880 --> 31:41.362
We need to talk.
Let's go to your office.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.366
It ain't my office anymore.
We can talk in here.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.931
Seems like you only told me
half of your little plan.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.720
What the fuck are you
talking about, Tash?

31:53.745 --> 31:56.125
Tommy came to me. He told me
you suggested killing Lobos.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.930
He's not down.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.570
Did you tell him
it was your idea?

31:59.720 --> 32:01.722
I would have. But you know what?

32:01.880 --> 32:03.962
He dropped a little knowledge
that I didn't have.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.884
You're trying to run
with that girl.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.804
Come on. Ain't nobody say that.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.043
Tommy said you want out.
I did the math, okay?

32:11.240 --> 32:14.722
You kill Lobos,
you take the girl, you run.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.565
Leave me with no income
and the kids with no fucking daddy.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.121
Who the fuck do you think I am,
saying some shit like that?

32:20.280 --> 32:22.282
Did I fucking cheat? Yes.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.603
That don't make me
any less of a father.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.080
I told you, you and the kids
would always be taken care of.

32:28.105 --> 32:29.948
I ain't running
any-goddamn-where.

32:32.560 --> 32:37.009
Look here... Tommy ain't down
with killing Lobos? Fuck him.

32:37.160 --> 32:40.403
Holly leaving him fucked him up?
That's fine, too.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.410
I'll find another way.
Don't I always think of something?

32:43.600 --> 32:45.648
And don't we always
do it together?

32:45.800 --> 32:48.087
I'm not gonna make any moves
that affect our kids

32:48.240 --> 32:50.322
without telling you first.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.809
You just be careful tomorrow.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.169
- Okay?
- Okay,

33:06.160 --> 33:08.481
Something smells good.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.689
- Where are the kids?
- Washing up for dinner.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.726
Okay. Stop.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.281
I don't want the kids to see us.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.171
I know, but it's
kind of hard, okay?

33:21.320 --> 33:24.005
Behave.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.567
Fine, I'm not staying anyway.
I'ma just grab a slice

33:27.720 --> 33:29.240
'cause I got to get
Uncle G from Truth.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.648
Tomorrow afternoon,

33:32.800 --> 33:35.531
if Ghost takes you to the Carlton,
I want you to be careful.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.409
Well, what's happening at the Carlton?

33:37.560 --> 33:41.246
I smell pepperoni.
What's up, Shawn?

33:41.400 --> 33:43.084
What's up, Keisha?

33:43.240 --> 33:45.322
Hey. Hey, T.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.050
What's up, girl?

33:47.200 --> 33:50.204
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, please.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.455
You told me to come over and have
some pizza with you and the kids.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.847
Of course. There's enough
for everybody. Help yourself.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.527
I ain't seen y'all in a minute.
What y'all been up to?

33:58.720 --> 34:01.485
Well, you know, just working.
Staying busy driving Uncle G and stuff.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.765
Yeah, just nothing much, really.
Being, you know... mom stuff.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.321
Sounds like y'all been busy.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.163
- I should get going.
- Okay.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.522
I gotta go get Uncle G.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.762
Later, Keisha. Mrs. St. Patrick.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.888
Okay, bye.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.681
Okay. Let's see here.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.522
So how long y'all been fuckin'?

34:31.440 --> 34:33.681
Keisha, you were the one
that told me to pick a man.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.521
Yes, I did. And as usual,
you did me one better.

34:37.719 --> 34:40.041
But I can't knock
your hustle, Tasha.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.646
Fucking one man
and living off another.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.962
But here's one thing.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.360
How you gonna make sure
Ghost don't find out?

34:47.560 --> 34:51.201
Shawn knows
how to keep his mouth shut.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.050
Dad, what are you doing here?

35:00.240 --> 35:02.242
Your mama said
you been staying out all night.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.607
And I figured out why.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.250
How long you been
smashing Tasha?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.890
It's not even like that, Pop.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.765
Man, Stevie Wonder could see
y'all fucking.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.928
Question is,
how long you been sprung?

35:13.080 --> 35:17.563
I'm not. If anything, I'm using her
for information like you wanted.

35:19.120 --> 35:21.327
Tasha too smart
to tell you a damn thing.

35:21.480 --> 35:25.690
But you, you stupid enough to go
running your mouth at any fucking time.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.808
All you niggas forgot
the first rule of bitches.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.200
- Don't tell them shit.
- Yeah, well, you tripping, then.

35:30.225 --> 35:34.244
She tells me things.
Not the other way around.

35:34.440 --> 35:37.922
All right, then, talk.
Tell me one real thing she told you.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.003
I know that Uncle G
is going to a big meeting

35:40.160 --> 35:42.083
tomorrow afternoon
at the Carlton Hotel.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.929
Tasha told you that?

35:48.120 --> 35:50.487
Yeah.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.527
So how was the pussy?

35:54.680 --> 35:57.126
Well, I've been in jail 10 years.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.851
If I ain't getting in it personally,
I want it play-by-play.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.606
Come on. Tell me how it was.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.726
Domino!

36:18.960 --> 36:22.646
Dre, this is my reward
for bringing you into my home?

36:22.800 --> 36:26.202
An uninvited guest? Kanan.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.328
Young'un meant
no disrespect, Vibora.

36:28.480 --> 36:32.007
I told him to bring me.
I got business to discuss.

36:42.560 --> 36:46.565
Kanan. I remember you
from around the way, man.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.204
I think you shot
a friend of my cousin's.

36:51.360 --> 36:54.682
That sound like me.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.842
Heard Dre here
saved your ass the other night.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.846
Yes, he did. Serbian motherfuckers
were a bad shot, right?

37:02.160 --> 37:03.924
Look, man, were you serious

37:04.080 --> 37:06.367
when you stepped to me
about working together?

37:06.520 --> 37:08.124
That was just frustration.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.362
I'm happy with
my current situation.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.205
That's right, you got that seat
at the table with Ghost and Tommy.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.523
You should be getting ready
for that meeting with Lobos tomorrow.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.761
- They didn't tell me.
- That's disrespect, man.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.048
- There's no way around it.
- Right.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.124
We need to go
to Lobos ourselves.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.204
Done that. It doesn't work.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.930
You didn't have
your ducks in a row.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.568
If we get everybody from Ghost and
Tommy's organization to commit first,

37:39.720 --> 37:41.449
Lobos can't walk away.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.409
They're not just
gonna step aside.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.722
Cutting Ghost and Tommy out
means killing 'em.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.929
Well, we've known the rules
to the streets since we was kids.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.929
Tommy is a good man.

37:54.120 --> 37:56.771
Till Ghost tell him
to stab you in the back.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.569
Are you down?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.570
'Cause if you are,
we need to start now.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.842
You requested to meet me alone.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.128
What you mean
is to meet without Tommy,

38:20.280 --> 38:22.089
our mutual connection.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.641
I like Tommy, but I came here
to talk about Ghost.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.963
You understand why Tommy
can't be a part of this, right?

38:34.600 --> 38:36.045
Ghost makes promises
he can't keep.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.487
He opens and shuts the pipeline,
demands early payment.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.529
You're looking to start a coup.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.843
Do you think it's safe
to come to me with your plan?

38:45.960 --> 38:47.610
The shipment from Milan,

38:47.800 --> 38:49.802
the one that got hijacked
by the Albanians,

38:49.960 --> 38:52.327
the one that forced you
into working with Ghost and Tommy...

38:52.480 --> 38:55.450
It wasn't the Albanians.

38:55.640 --> 38:58.849
Ghost's first plan was to kill you.
Tommy talked him out of it.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.685
He's still a friend.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.365
What proof do you have?

39:06.840 --> 39:08.888
I was part of it.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.691
Then I should kill you, too.

39:11.840 --> 39:14.650
I just brought you the truth.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.644
You're on the outs with Milan.
You kill Ghost, you have no connect

39:17.800 --> 39:19.723
unless you align with me.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.884
Kanan, Dre, and Drifty
are very loyal to him.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.644
They're strong, Ruiz.

39:24.840 --> 39:28.162
I thought you might say that.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.766
You must be Kanan.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.640
I'm the motherfucker who taught
Ghost and Tommy everything they know.

39:39.665 --> 39:41.329
Tommy trusts me.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.680
I'm gonna surprise Ghost
at the Lobos meeting tomorrow.

39:43.705 --> 39:45.443
Get Tommy to take me
in the room.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.682
Once I'm in there,
I'll tell Lobos to his face

39:47.840 --> 39:51.003
Ghost and Tommy done lost control
of the organization.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.124
With all y'all behind me, we'll put
Ghost and Tommy out the game forever.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.685
Got all the pieces
to the puzzle.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.842
Vladimir, all you got to do
is say yes.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.603
Thanks for meeting me
on short notice.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.683
That's not a problem.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.803
I like to do research
on my clients

40:08.960 --> 40:12.282
and there's very little information
on James St. Patrick out there

40:12.440 --> 40:14.807
outside from the fact
that you own a nightclub.

40:14.960 --> 40:18.601
That doesn't tell me why a guy
like you needs my services, so...

40:18.760 --> 40:21.570
Well, let's just say that you and I
are more similar than you think.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.291
I feel like I can trust you.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.891
What makes you think that?

40:26.040 --> 40:28.805
I know that you buy
your ex-wife Xanax, Oxy,

40:28.960 --> 40:32.248
cocaine even, weekly.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.971
In exchange, she allows you
full custody of your daughter.

40:40.720 --> 40:43.087
You make good money.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.800
But unfortunately,
your ex-wife's drug habit

40:45.960 --> 40:47.800
has gotten you in over your head
with some guys

40:47.825 --> 40:50.484
that cause real physical damage
to settle a debt.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.005
So now I owe you.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.003
"Owe" is such a dramatic word.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.766
I would just say
that you and I both know

40:56.920 --> 41:00.845
my knowledge of your extracurricular
activities could get you disbarred.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.685
And that's all the trust
I need between us.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.081
Fine.

41:06.240 --> 41:08.766
I'll represent you.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.161
Well played, by the way.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.127
I'll be in contact.

41:20.760 --> 41:24.207
Ground control will cut off exits
and entrances at the warehouse here.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.203
We'll have air support
around the area as well.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.440
But I don't want those choppers
flying in prematurely

41:28.596 --> 41:31.076
spooking these guys until
all of our players are in position.

41:31.276 --> 41:34.328
No, the helos won't move in
until we give the okay.

41:34.480 --> 41:37.165
NYPD, we'll bring you guys in

41:37.320 --> 41:40.290
at 28th and 34th for a base.

41:40.440 --> 41:44.490
SWAT, bringin' you at 10th and 30th.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.165
Also, it is imperative
that we control

41:46.320 --> 41:48.288
all the pedestrian traffic
around this building.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.600
We don't want anybody
getting caught in our crossfire,

41:50.791 --> 41:52.511
which is a potential.
We've got to have eyes

41:52.671 --> 41:54.488
on all of these
exits and entrances.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.405

I want on the rooftops

41:57.560 --> 41:59.560
peeping out what's going
on in this building, okay?

41:59.640 --> 42:01.165
Does that make sense
to everybody?

42:01.320 --> 42:03.000
Now, Greg, where should we
set up field ops

42:03.160 --> 42:04.600
so we make sure
we stay out of sight?

42:04.625 --> 42:07.390
West 11th. Anything West 11th.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.049
Mira.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.246
It's not like you

43:20.400 --> 43:22.767
to dip out in the middle
of the day like this.

43:24.480 --> 43:26.289
You're usually too busy
these days.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.649
I just really,
really needed to see you.

43:32.440 --> 43:35.922

right now?

44:31.840 --> 44:36.129
Together.
Just dropped everything.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.850
Ange, is this about Tommy?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.729
No. No.

44:39.880 --> 44:42.804
This is about us.
I don't want to think about Tommy

44:42.960 --> 44:45.327
or Tasha or work or anything.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.801
Let's just go right now
straight to the airport.

44:47.960 --> 44:50.327
I don't even need clothes.
I just need you.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.209
Just you.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.685
I plan on us leaving together.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.326
Me and you.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.721
I just can't today.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.529
Angie, I got obligations.

45:14.680 --> 45:17.843
I got a big meeting at Truth.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.207
I can't miss it.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.402
I gotta go.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.842
I understand.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.849

47:07.360 --> 47:09.806
ASAP.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.720
- Yeah.
- Okay, do your thing. Do your thing.

47:11.745 --> 47:13.887
Sir.

47:14.040 --> 47:17.567
I just saw the distributor
going into the meeting with Lobos.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.360
Are you serious?
We haven't even seen Egan

47:19.385 --> 47:20.945
in the past two days.
It's not possible.

47:27.520 --> 47:29.682
Hold on.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.000
I just sent you a photo
of Tommy Egan

47:43.160 --> 47:44.525
arriving at the Carlton.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.205
Maybe you'll believe me now.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.406
How did you find him?

47:52.560 --> 47:54.608
A source told me
where the meet would be.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.888
What's the source?

47:57.040 --> 47:59.725
Angela, what is the source?
I can't... fuck!

48:16.000 --> 48:18.571
I'll hit you back after
once I talk to Lobos.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.131
And, no, I don't need no backup.

48:20.280 --> 48:23.045
- I got this by myself.
- No doubt.

48:33.560 --> 48:36.404
Hey, Alpha Team,
you're moving inside with us.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.085
Have Bravo Team secure the doors

48:47.240 --> 48:49.402
on the side and the rear
of this building.

48:49.560 --> 48:50.925
Move in.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.730
What the hell are we doing here?

48:52.880 --> 48:54.769
Egan's here and he's
carrying a duffle bag

48:54.920 --> 48:55.921
stuffed with something.

48:56.080 --> 48:58.651
Money? Drugs?
Any proof that Lobos is inside?

48:58.800 --> 49:01.929
No, but why else would Tommy Egan
be at a place like this today

49:02.120 --> 49:05.761
when we know Lobos is on the move
and looking for his money?

49:07.160 --> 49:10.846
Yeah. Hey, take this walkie.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.923
Stay down here.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.969
- Let's go.
- Go.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.127
Get me on Tac.

49:50.640 --> 49:54.167
FBI! Get the fuck on the ground!
Go! Get down!

49:54.320 --> 49:56.049
- Show me your hands!
- Don't shoot!

49:56.200 --> 49:58.123
- Don't fucking shoot!
- Hands up! Hands up!

49:58.280 --> 50:00.240
Get your hands where I can see them!
Keep them up!

50:00.265 --> 50:01.683
Perp down.

50:01.840 --> 50:05.049
- Everybody, we got one perp down.
- Weapons secure.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.490
We got him. Target is secure.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.166
I repeat, the target is secure.
We have Lobos in custody.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.328
We got him, Mike.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.530
Gracias.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.165
Everyone get out? Good?

50:46.400 --> 50:48.050
What the fuck?

50:49.720 --> 50:51.529
Angie. Yeah.

50:51.680 --> 50:54.570
Fucking rotten cunt bitch!
You ain't never changed.

50:54.720 --> 50:56.720
- I fucking know everything.
- Get him out of here.

50:56.745 --> 51:00.281
Gonna get you, Angela!
You started something, bitch!

51:00.440 --> 51:02.681
Time to stay scared, Angie.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.127
Wait a second.
I need to ID the perp.

51:17.400 --> 51:22.042
- His passport says "Javier Villanueva."
- Right, one of Lobos's guys.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.924
Is there anyone else up there?
Any other bodies?

51:28.080 --> 51:30.242
No, room's clear.

51:35.080 --> 51:36.923
Excuse me.

51:43.280 --> 51:46.090
The person
you are trying to reach is unavailable.

51:46.240 --> 51:48.891
Please leave a message.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.606
Jamie, where are you?

51:51.760 --> 51:53.762
I need to talk to you right away.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.088
Call me back
as soon as you get this.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.689
Did you do this?

52:11.840 --> 52:14.255
Did you get Tommy arrested
after I told you where that meeting was?

52:14.280 --> 52:17.000
Fuck, no. Do I look like a motherfucker
who'd tell the cops anything?

52:17.025 --> 52:19.804
Ghost's rat ass probably did.
Like he did when I got knocked.

52:19.960 --> 52:22.850
- What are you talking about, Dad?
- Your uncle set me up.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.843
Sent me to jail.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.482
Said he had a couple runs to make.
Couldn't do it.

52:28.640 --> 52:31.530
I had you from your mother,
I said I'd take care of it.

52:31.680 --> 52:35.605
- You was in the car with me.
- I remember.

52:35.760 --> 52:39.845
Cops pulled us over
talking about the taillight blown.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.480
Search the motherfucking car,
find the dope, take me to jail.

52:42.640 --> 52:45.041
Come to find out the taillight
wasn't blown.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.282
Motherfuckers
unscrewed the taillight.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.683
- They set me the fuck up.
- That doesn't mean Uncle G did it.

52:50.840 --> 52:54.162
Shawn, I was running shit then.
Me. Kanan.

52:54.320 --> 52:57.200
Ghost and Tommy kept coming around
talking about shit I wasn't down with,

52:57.225 --> 53:00.069
so he got rid of me
by sending me to prison.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.368
All them years
we ain't been together

53:03.520 --> 53:05.568
was your Uncle G's doing.

53:05.720 --> 53:08.690
He robbed us of all that time.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.520
And we gonna give
that nigga street justice

53:10.545 --> 53:13.276
and bury his ass
six feet deep, man.

53:14.680 --> 53:17.524
You love your motherfucking
Uncle G so much, man.

53:18.840 --> 53:22.401
He sent me away.
Sent Tommy away.

53:22.560 --> 53:25.370
He the only one standing in the way
of what you want with Tasha, right?

53:30.160 --> 53:32.208
How long you think
before he send you away?

53:32.360 --> 53:34.044
HOW long?

53:38.720 --> 53:41.724
Well, the nigga gotta go.
I'd kill the motherfucker myself,

53:41.880 --> 53:43.405
but he'd see me coming
a mile away.

53:43.560 --> 53:46.404
- He won't see me.
- He doesn't trust you.

53:49.120 --> 53:51.088
Y'all need somebody
that he'll trust.

53:52.520 --> 53:55.285
Somebody he'll relax around.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.930
Somebody like you.

53:57.080 --> 53:58.730
Man, this little nigga
ain't ready, man.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.400
He is ready. I made you ready
when I gave you that gun.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.927
I told you a day may come
that you need to use it.

54:04.080 --> 54:05.764
That day is now.

54:05.920 --> 54:09.720
I want you to right Ghost's wrongs
for separating us by taking him out.

54:11.800 --> 54:13.723
You in?

54:15.400 --> 54:17.448
Yeah.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.762
I'm in.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.167
Hey, stop breathing on me.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.324
See you, sexy.

54:39.760 --> 54:42.604
Can I have my check, please?

54:47.120 --> 54:49.122
What, you skip out
on your victory lap?

54:50.440 --> 54:53.922
Killing someone
is never a victory.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.445
I don't care who it is.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.810
Congratulations.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.487
You followed your instincts
and they proved to be correct.

55:03.640 --> 55:04.846
Thank you.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.604
So Tommy Egan was Ghost
all along?

55:06.760 --> 55:09.809
I mean, who else would have been
at that meeting, right?

55:11.680 --> 55:15.127
Obviously your source is gonna
have to come forward now.

55:15.280 --> 55:19.046
But that's tomorrow's problem.
Tonight we're celebrating, right?

55:19.200 --> 55:21.646
Everybody, listen up.

55:21.800 --> 55:24.007
I want to raise a glass

55:24.160 --> 55:27.881
to AUSA Angela Valdes.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.644
- Way to go, Angie.
- No.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.524
We don't always see eye-to-eye.

55:31.720 --> 55:34.007
Hell, we never see eye-to-eye.

55:34.160 --> 55:36.208
I actually kind of hate her.

55:36.360 --> 55:39.330
But because of her,
we got our guy.

55:39.520 --> 55:43.161
And we are all about
to get promotions.

55:43.360 --> 55:45.681
- Oh, yeah.
- To Angela Valdes.

55:45.840 --> 55:47.365
Thank you.

55:47.520 --> 55:49.841
Okay, this guy
is officially cut off.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.651
Never.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.689
But I'm willing
to buy you two a drink.

55:54.840 --> 55:56.365
Yeah.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.410
Actually, I'm about to take off.
But thank you.

55:59.560 --> 56:02.689
- Come on, I'll walk you out.
- That's okay. I'm okay.

56:02.840 --> 56:04.524
Have a good night.

56:04.680 --> 56:07.251
- 'Night.
- Good night, Angela.
