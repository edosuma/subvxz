14:56.500 --> 14:58.767
No. I... It don't work
like that.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.333
You see, I-I got my playlist,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.600
and my
station manager
Earle here says,

15:02.667 --> 15:03.867
"If you play something,

15:03.933 --> 15:05.667
"you got to be able
to go buy it someplace."

15:05.733 --> 15:08.733
Ain't that right,
Mr. Hutchins, sir?

15:08.800 --> 15:09.800
That's right.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.667
Now, play these.

15:12.367 --> 15:13.733
In this order.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.233
Yes, sir.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.900
Man, get these...

15:21.967 --> 15:23.233
You're running the board

15:23.300 --> 15:25.500
for the BB King session
tomorrow. Remember?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.267
Yeah. So?

15:27.333 --> 15:30.633
"So?" "So?" "So?"
You dense or something?

15:30.700 --> 15:34.533
I got you the gig
'cause it's for Joe Bihari.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.667
Modern Records?

15:35.733 --> 15:36.833
Modern Records.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.167
You get him to put BeBop out,

15:38.233 --> 15:41.067
boy, I'll play
the bejesus out of it.

15:42.467 --> 15:44.067
That easy, huh?

15:44.100 --> 15:45.300
That easy.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.333
All right.

15:48.933 --> 15:50.233
Mmm.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.300
Red hot and blue, WHBQ!

15:53.367 --> 15:55.567

eight till midnight.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.333

15:58.400 --> 16:02.167

Anytime.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.233
Jim. Colonel Tom Parker.

16:13.300 --> 16:18.100
Now, remember,
2:10 on the nose. Anytime.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.867
I have no idea
where the Colonel is.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.133
No idea at all.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.400
I don't think we need to wait.

16:39.467 --> 16:41.200
I don't think we do either.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.667
You've had a great year, Eddy.
Congratulations.

16:44.733 --> 16:47.767
RCA has
boundless confidence
in your future.

16:47.833 --> 16:52.733
We're upping your royalty
from two to three percent.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.467
Herb, I think this calls
for a little celebration.

16:55.533 --> 16:57.567
The good stuff. Glenlivet.

16:57.633 --> 16:59.067
Um... Well, now, now, now.
Hold on.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.533
The Colonel
really should be here.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.467
Oh. Let's sign.

17:12.533 --> 17:16.200
Then we can crack
this baby open.
What do you say?

17:16.267 --> 17:18.133
There's no better deal
to be had.

17:20.367 --> 17:22.467
Now as much as
I would like to sign...

17:22.533 --> 17:25.133
Whoo! Forgive my tardiness.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.300
Colonel. Perfect timing.

17:27.367 --> 17:28.767
I was just telling Eddy here

17:28.833 --> 17:30.767
that we're upping his royalty
to three percent.

17:32.867 --> 17:35.067
Hold on.

17:35.133 --> 17:40.067
I just got this telegram
from Don Law at Columbia.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.700
"Must have Arnold. Stop.

17:42.767 --> 17:45.200
"Five percent. Stop.

17:45.267 --> 17:49.067
"5000 a quarter, guaranteed."

17:49.067 --> 17:50.200
Whoo! Wee.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.333
Uh, that's 20,000 smackeroos
a year.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.600
Yeah, and Paul Cohen

17:53.667 --> 17:55.433
from Decca's been
leaving messages.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.200
Uh, we have a deal.

17:57.267 --> 17:58.800
Well, we haven't signed,

17:58.867 --> 18:02.300
and I feel... Awful.

18:04.933 --> 18:05.933
Steve, let's face it,

18:06.067 --> 18:07.400
you can't turn on
the damn radio

18:07.467 --> 18:09.400
without hearing Eddy Arnold.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.767
Perhaps that's a bit
of an exaggeration?

18:11.833 --> 18:13.333
No, that's a fact.

18:16.267 --> 18:18.900
Steve, are you
a gambling man?

18:18.967 --> 18:22.167
If we don't hear Eddy
all across the dial right now,

18:22.233 --> 18:23.667
we'll go back to the old deal.

18:23.733 --> 18:25.667
-Uh.
-No royalty bump. No advance.

18:25.733 --> 18:28.933
But if Eddy is all over
the radio,

18:30.200 --> 18:32.267
you match Columbia's offer.

18:42.433 --> 18:45.067

But who got him there?

19:15.333 --> 19:16.733
Me, Herb,

19:17.533 --> 19:19.367
RCA Victor.

19:20.667 --> 19:23.333
I don't have the approval
to go that high.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.533
Just one second, huh?
One second.

19:30.967 --> 19:33.267
Colonel, come here.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.167
Take the Columbia deal.

19:35.233 --> 19:36.700
There is no deal.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.133
What?

Now, look, I know the offer
at Columbia's better,

19:39.900 --> 19:42.500
but, uh, business shouldn't
be all about money.

19:42.567 --> 19:46.067
I mean, relationships
and loyalty should count, too.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.433

20:12.267 --> 20:14.433
if it wasn't for RCA.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.100
Why don't we split
the difference? Four percent.

20:17.167 --> 20:19.867

20:38.900 --> 20:40.067

20:50.533 --> 20:51.800
The console model.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.667
And, uh, one for the Colonel,
of course.

20:59.433 --> 21:00.733
If they'd have
called your bluff,

21:00.800 --> 21:02.833
I'd be without a record deal
right now.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.867
But you're not.

are just flopping.

21:22.733 --> 21:24.500

21:24.567 --> 21:26.467
But he's chasing her down.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.367
She's got his pants
and his billfold.

21:28.433 --> 21:29.667
What happened?

21:29.733 --> 21:31.400
Well, ruined a great take.

You get what you pay for.

21:32.933 --> 21:35.500

more expensive.

28:32.833 --> 28:34.700
mental issues
back in Nashville.

28:34.767 --> 28:36.567
It was never my business,
Becky, I don't know...

28:36.633 --> 28:39.533
Well, this move was supposed
to put all that behind us.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.100
Um.

28:44.633 --> 28:46.067
Do you need to get that?

28:46.700 --> 28:48.067
Excuse me.

28:49.733 --> 28:51.433
Memphis Recording Service.

28:51.500 --> 28:55.133
Well, hello, Miss Marion.
Any calls?

28:55.200 --> 28:58.267
Becky's here right now.

28:58.333 --> 29:01.333
Aw, hell. What does she want?

29:01.400 --> 29:03.067
Do you want to talk to her?

29:03.867 --> 29:06.700
I can't right now.

29:06.767 --> 29:09.233
Tell her I'll be running late.

29:12.067 --> 29:14.067
It's Sam.
He says he's running late.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.633
Isn't he always.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.700
The other night, he...

29:18.767 --> 29:21.133
Well, never mind.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.067
Bye.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.933
I'm sure you must get going.

29:26.067 --> 29:27.400
It's always so wonderful
to see you.

29:27.467 --> 29:30.367
There is something
that I want to say, actually.

29:33.067 --> 29:35.833
I don't understand
the music Sam's recording.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.633
I wish I did, but I, I don't.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.833
You really should speak
with Sam. He's...

29:40.900 --> 29:42.767
Marion. Please.

29:42.833 --> 29:44.067
I know what you're doing,

29:44.100 --> 29:45.733
and I need you to know
that I know...

29:45.800 --> 29:47.167
Becky, I don't...

29:47.233 --> 29:49.267
Sam is lucky to have you.

29:51.633 --> 29:54.167
Uh, we're both

29:54.233 --> 29:56.567
so lucky to have you.

29:56.633 --> 29:58.500
You're spending all your time
with Sam to make sure

29:58.567 --> 30:02.067
that this dream of his
and mine comes true.

30:07.633 --> 30:09.000
Thank you.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.233
Don't keep him up too late.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.667
Choose between...

30:26.733 --> 30:29.367
Elvis, turn that down
and get in here!

30:34.433 --> 30:37.767
The boy ain't got her
in trouble, has he?

30:37.833 --> 30:39.700
Son, you datin' a girl Trixie?

30:39.767 --> 30:41.233
-Oh, yeah.
-You know he is.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.300
He is.

30:43.233 --> 30:45.333
You seen him where?

30:45.400 --> 30:48.167
Well, I will talk to him
about that.

30:49.567 --> 30:52.500
You troublin' this Trixie?
Cheerleader practice?

30:52.567 --> 30:56.000
No, sir. Just asked her
on a date is all.

30:57.267 --> 31:00.633
Well, well, I...
I'm gonna talk to the boy.

31:00.700 --> 31:02.400
About all of it.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.567
Oh, no, he won't.

31:05.633 --> 31:07.433
I can promise you that.

31:11.933 --> 31:13.700
That was Trixie's daddy.

31:13.767 --> 31:16.133
He said he seen a boy lookin'
just like Elvis

31:16.200 --> 31:19.267
comin' out
of a colored church.

31:19.333 --> 31:21.467
Daddy,
I didn't mean nothin' by it.

31:21.533 --> 31:23.767
I was just listenin'
to the preachin', the prayin',

31:23.833 --> 31:25.067
the singin'.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.367
Look, if I'da known

31:26.433 --> 31:27.667
it was gonna cause
all this big ruckus,

31:27.733 --> 31:28.700
-I'da, I'da just stayed...
-It's okay, son.

31:28.767 --> 31:30.300
No, it's not okay.

31:30.367 --> 31:31.600
Trixie's daddy said

31:31.667 --> 31:33.667
for Elvis to stay
the hell away from her.

31:33.733 --> 31:34.900
Pumpkin...

31:34.967 --> 31:36.633
I'm 'bout ready
to whup your ass, son,

31:36.700 --> 31:37.833
clear across to Arkansas.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.267
Pumpkin, you need
to keep your mind

31:39.333 --> 31:40.900
on your schoolwork
instead of that girl.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.767
I'm tired of y'all telling me
what to do all the time!

31:42.833 --> 31:44.067
Hey, hey, boy.

31:44.133 --> 31:47.067
Panty-waist boy
gonna talk to us that way?

31:47.067 --> 31:51.333
Longest day I live,
that ain't gonna happen.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.600
You stay the hell away
from the colored church.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.200
Lord, have mercy.

32:04.133 --> 32:05.800
♪ Wine, wine

32:05.867 --> 32:09.167
♪ Sweet wine all the time

32:09.233 --> 32:12.367
♪ You're gonna have to choose
between me... ♪

32:17.100 --> 32:19.100
Couldn't hack it.

32:19.167 --> 32:23.100
Putting 51 gaskets
on 51 Pontiacs,

32:23.167 --> 32:26.200
52 gaskets on 52 Pontiacs,

32:26.267 --> 32:28.233
spending all my time
in hillbilly bars,

32:28.300 --> 32:30.533
drinkin' up my money
and dreamin' of home.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.100
It was that bad?

32:32.167 --> 32:33.367
Round where I come from,

32:33.433 --> 32:34.600
the three
R's are readin', writin',

32:34.667 --> 32:35.967
and the road to Detroit.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.767
Half the fellas in my year
are workin' up there.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.300
Well, only work I've ever done

32:41.367 --> 32:44.400
is helping my daddy
with his magic act.

32:45.067 --> 32:46.100
Magic act?

32:46.167 --> 32:47.300
Yeah.

32:47.367 --> 32:48.633
Yeah. He sells insurance
during the week

32:48.700 --> 32:51.333
and on the weekends,
he has a magic act.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.900
He saws you in two?

32:52.967 --> 32:54.633
Stuff like that.

32:55.900 --> 32:59.100
My old man made me disappear.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.367
You know who JC is,
don't you?

33:07.433 --> 33:11.300
Um, Jesus Christ?

33:11.367 --> 33:14.700
You know what L stands for,
don't you?

33:14.767 --> 33:17.267
Lost, leave, left.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.067
Aw, you know.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.333
You know who VL is, don't you?

33:25.367 --> 33:27.667
Vivien Leigh?

33:27.733 --> 33:29.167
Nope.

33:29.233 --> 33:31.500
It's someone prettier
than Vivian Leigh.

33:42.967 --> 33:45.667
Viv, I know that we ain't
known each other long.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.067
Three whole days.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.800
Hmm. Thing is, I wouldn't
never have found you

33:48.867 --> 33:51.267
if I wasn't goin' off
to Germany,

33:51.333 --> 33:53.300
but now I don't wanna go.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.267
How long will you be away?

33:59.167 --> 34:00.700
Not long.

34:01.867 --> 34:03.967
How long is not long?

34:04.067 --> 34:05.367
Just three years.

34:07.067 --> 34:08.367
Three years.

34:12.100 --> 34:14.900
I'll be an old maid
by the time you get back.

34:18.567 --> 34:20.733
Will you wait for me, Viv?

34:23.067 --> 34:24.667
Three years?

34:30.533 --> 34:32.533
Yes.

34:32.600 --> 34:36.633
Yes, John Cash,
I'll wait for you.

34:42.467 --> 34:44.667
Oh, it's hell at home
right now.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.200
Becky,

34:47.267 --> 34:49.667
longest day she lives,

34:49.733 --> 34:53.800
she'll never get this music.

34:54.867 --> 34:56.333
You know?

35:02.267 --> 35:03.967
I gotta tell ya,

35:06.433 --> 35:10.567
I've been sneaking around
with Marion.

35:10.633 --> 35:13.133
I figured you was, boy.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.667
But she gets me, right?

35:15.733 --> 35:19.467
But I'll tell you,
she wants me so damn bad,

35:19.533 --> 35:22.067
it scares
me, man.

35:22.067 --> 35:26.067
I mean, I'm supposed to be
at the flicks right now.

35:26.100 --> 35:27.467
Seeing uh,

35:28.300 --> 35:30.333
well what was it, uh,

35:31.133 --> 35:33.200
Singin' With the Rain.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.600
At the Memphian
with her right now,

35:37.667 --> 35:39.900
I mean, can you imagine?

35:39.967 --> 35:41.067
Whoo!

35:44.967 --> 35:47.800
Man, we uptown 'bout as far
as you can get, boy.

35:47.867 --> 35:49.700
Ah. I owe you for Bihari, man.
I do.

35:49.767 --> 35:51.600
No, really. I appreciate it.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.133
You know he brushed off
Joe Hill?

35:53.200 --> 35:56.067
Door's open now, man.
That's the important thing.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.367
Sam, man,
you're a music guy

36:06.433 --> 36:08.267
tryin' to figure out
the business.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.667
Oh, all right.

36:09.733 --> 36:11.067
And they are,

36:11.067 --> 36:12.267
they are business guys

36:12.333 --> 36:13.633
tryin' to figure out
the damn music, man.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.933
My money's on you.

36:17.367 --> 36:19.800
I'll, I'll tell you
what, slick.

36:19.867 --> 36:22.333
Why don't we press up Joe Hill
our own selves, man,

36:22.400 --> 36:24.533
and prove Bihari wrong? Wrong!

36:24.600 --> 36:25.667
-Wrong.
-Wrong.

36:25.733 --> 36:27.533
-Wrong. Wrong.
-Wrong. Wrong.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.667
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

36:29.733 --> 36:30.933
That's... That's...

36:32.267 --> 36:33.667
I'm sorry.

36:36.100 --> 36:38.733
We'll show Joe damn Bihari
how to sell records, boy.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.800
How many records
we should press up, huh?

36:40.867 --> 36:43.200
5000? 10,000?

36:43.267 --> 36:44.633
At least 300.

36:47.367 --> 36:48.500
It wrecked him,

36:48.567 --> 36:50.067
hell, it damn near killed him.

36:52.267 --> 36:54.967
-Eddy Arnold. That really you?
-Uh, well, yes, ma'am.

36:55.067 --> 36:57.067
I got just about every record
you ever made.

36:57.133 --> 37:00.333
Cattle Call.
What is Life Without Love?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.800
I mean, what is it, right?

37:01.867 --> 37:03.067
Right.

37:03.067 --> 37:04.767
Little Angel
With the Dirty Face.

37:04.833 --> 37:06.967
You know, that could just
about be my theme song.

37:12.900 --> 37:15.600
It's time for me to retire.

37:19.733 --> 37:23.833
What did the Colonel promise
you when we started?

37:23.900 --> 37:27.400
My song on every jukebox,
my face on every lamp pole,

37:27.467 --> 37:31.233
and, uh, the finest ta-tas.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.567
What on Earth are you doing?

37:51.533 --> 37:52.867
Ironin'.

37:54.633 --> 37:58.067
It's four o' clock
in the morning, Sam.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.233
Those pills.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.533
Gotta have a nice shirt ironed

38:01.600 --> 38:03.200
before work in the morning.

38:04.767 --> 38:09.067
Gotta look right, right.
Shh. Sharp.

38:10.633 --> 38:13.400
On the wall and on.

38:13.467 --> 38:14.667
Sam...

38:19.833 --> 38:21.067
Give me a few minutes.

38:21.067 --> 38:23.067
Sam, Sam...

38:26.800 --> 38:28.867
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.700
Look at me. Look at me. Hey.

38:33.533 --> 38:37.433
It's all right. You just need
to get some sleep. Let's go.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.233
There's a lot of things to do.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.600
I know.

38:40.667 --> 38:42.733
We're gonna do them
in the morning, okay?

38:50.600 --> 38:52.867
Hey, look at me.

38:52.933 --> 38:54.733
-You all right?
-Mmm. Yeah.

38:58.067 --> 38:59.533
Come on.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.100
Why don't you try it in C?

39:11.533 --> 39:12.967
That guy down at Haney's

39:13.067 --> 39:14.800
was playin'
most everything in C.

39:14.867 --> 39:17.733
What was you boys doin'
at Haney's?

39:17.800 --> 39:18.900
I was just passin' by

39:18.967 --> 39:20.900
on my way home
from church, Momma.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.900
You better have been.

39:26.233 --> 39:30.133
So then my thumb will hit
the G and then the A.

39:35.567 --> 39:37.167
So now you're playin'

39:37.233 --> 39:39.100
half of what that
colored fella was playin',

39:39.167 --> 39:42.967
'cause he was playin'
two fisted.

39:43.067 --> 39:46.400
Hmm. At about one half
of one half the tempo.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.567
Go butt a stump.

39:47.633 --> 39:50.300
And in one chord.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.300
Hell, it's just one, two,
three, four.

39:56.367 --> 39:58.700
You ain't doin' like he done.
You ain't got that feelin'.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.267
Well, I know that, fool!

40:07.133 --> 40:09.333
Now you're getting some place.

40:13.967 --> 40:20.767
Yeah. That's some Devil's
music for you there, Swaggart.

40:20.833 --> 40:23.267
Now you gotta do somethin'
with that other hand.

40:28.833 --> 40:31.300
Hell, you wrecked that hand

40:31.367 --> 40:34.100
with all that ungodly
self-gratification.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.700
Can't say I didn't warn you!

40:45.667 --> 40:46.767
Yeah.

40:51.033 --> 40:52.033
Mmm.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.333
I do believe
you're gettin' it.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.567
You're a natural born
piano player, Jerry Lee.

41:02.633 --> 41:05.500
Work on it.
Bring that money home.

41:23.900 --> 41:26.067
Damn boy,
that beat is kickin'.

41:26.067 --> 41:29.233
Uh-huh. How do you like
that organ, huh? That's good.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.267
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

41:31.333 --> 41:32.800
300.

41:32.867 --> 41:35.333
You two Einsteins
couldn't press 25.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.633
Even 50. 300.

41:37.700 --> 41:38.933
I'm doing my part, man.

41:39.067 --> 41:40.967
I'm playin'
the hell outta BeBop Boy.

41:41.067 --> 41:43.167
You get calls on it?

41:43.233 --> 41:45.200
Yeah. Someone told me
he was tossin' his damn radio

41:45.267 --> 41:47.833
out the window if I didn't
quit playin' it, boy.

41:48.967 --> 41:51.100
The distributor took
every last copy.

41:51.167 --> 41:52.667
Well, that doesn't mean
he sold them.

41:52.733 --> 41:54.667
Yeah, but the way
Dewey's layin' on it,

41:54.733 --> 41:57.500
it's pretty much
