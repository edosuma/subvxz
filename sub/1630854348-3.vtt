WEBVTT

00:11.250 --> 00:12.291
A shooting star

00:12.875 --> 00:15.666
crossing the vast, indifferent night sky.

00:16.333 --> 00:20.125
Perhaps carrying an answer
to that age-old question,

00:20.208 --> 00:22.208
are we alone in the universe?

00:24.166 --> 00:26.458
Recorded on a modest device,

00:26.541 --> 00:28.416
stained with blood and death,

00:29.000 --> 00:33.375
the answer is
a decidedly terrifying… "no."

00:34.833 --> 00:37.333
Our story today is The Autopsy.

00:37.416 --> 00:39.708
And its director David Prior.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.333
What are you doing?

03:24.416 --> 03:26.875
Joe, what the fuck
are you doing up there?

03:26.958 --> 03:29.541
You're gonna kill us!
Are you fucking crazy?

03:29.625 --> 03:31.875
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

03:31.958 --> 03:33.208
You trying to kill us?

03:44.541 --> 03:46.041
What the fuck is that?

06:10.375 --> 06:11.583
You're so thin.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.500
They could use you for a whip.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.708
What's your secret?

06:16.791 --> 06:20.125
-Ah, you know, biology.
-Hell, Carl. It's good to see you.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.833
-You too, Nate. It's been too long.
-Give me that.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.791
Oh.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.625
Ooh. Must be exhausted.

06:26.416 --> 06:29.583
-Did you eat? I can send someone.

06:29.666 --> 06:31.875
No, no, no. Coffee is just fine.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.333
How's Emma?

06:36.041 --> 06:37.541
Oh. She's well.

06:39.125 --> 06:40.125
How are the kids?

06:40.791 --> 06:42.958
It's an empty nest almost.

06:43.041 --> 06:45.000
-Thank God!

06:45.083 --> 06:47.416
Yeah, and Cindy, she's in love, and…

06:48.375 --> 06:51.708
Nate Jr. wants to be a… a lawyer now.

06:51.791 --> 06:52.875
Oh.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.000
Sure I can't get you something to eat?

06:57.166 --> 06:59.125
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.791
What did they say in Montague?

07:02.291 --> 07:04.458
Not too much. Ten men dead.

07:05.375 --> 07:06.250
Nine men.

07:07.333 --> 07:10.000
And one inhuman son of a bitch.

07:11.791 --> 07:13.666
What would you call a man who…

07:16.500 --> 07:17.541
As bad as that?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.208
-What's Waddleton gonna do?
-Uh-huh.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.000
It is the position
of the coroner's office,

07:27.083 --> 07:32.083
workman's compensation law being clear,
that death benefits shall only accrue

07:32.166 --> 07:37.166
to dependents of those whose deaths arise
<i>out</i> of the course of their employment.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.416
Not merely <i>in</i> the course
of their employment.

07:42.791 --> 07:44.875
Death by lunatic does not obtain.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.458
He just about ordered me to find cause
for a second autopsy in the city.

07:50.541 --> 07:53.000
Oh, that's Fordham Mutual talking.

07:53.083 --> 07:56.791
Certainly it is, and they've bought
every election he's ever stood.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.583
If they had their way,
the families wouldn't see a dime

07:59.666 --> 08:01.041
to bury their men with.

08:01.541 --> 08:02.750
It's unconscionable.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.750
What am I gonna find, Nate?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.291
Was there a bomb?

08:07.375 --> 08:10.916
The investigators concluded
that there was strong,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.166
presumptive evidence of a bomb.

08:13.708 --> 08:15.708
That's the best they could do?

08:15.791 --> 08:17.208
-Mm-hmm.
-Hmm.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.791
-And what do you think?
-I think I'm cursed.

08:22.583 --> 08:23.416
Cursed?

08:23.916 --> 08:25.958
Well, for laxity

08:27.083 --> 08:28.875
and uselessness.

08:29.625 --> 08:34.208
The innocent get punished
and everything is just dust.

08:35.791 --> 08:38.291
I… I think I'm cursed by the Lord.
I truly do.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.208
Nate, I've known you 40 years.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.166
From the bottom of my heart,

08:43.250 --> 08:44.666
you're not that special.

08:45.833 --> 08:46.666
That's ego.

08:46.750 --> 08:50.708
Who are you to claim special qualities
of sin from the rest of us?

08:51.250 --> 08:52.708
If you're cursed,

08:52.791 --> 08:53.791
we're all cursed.

08:56.833 --> 08:59.583
And I meant that
in the nicest possible way.

09:04.541 --> 09:06.916
You're right. I'm getting maudlin.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.333
-Mm.

09:12.041 --> 09:12.875
Carl,

09:14.083 --> 09:17.833
this is one of those nightmare specials.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.708
The kind you never get to the bottom of.

09:23.291 --> 09:24.791
Tell me what happened.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.375
Two months ago…

09:30.250 --> 09:31.625
<i>…a man came up missing.</i>

09:33.958 --> 09:35.166
<i> Ronald Hanley.</i>

09:36.458 --> 09:38.166
<i>Mill worker, family man,</i>

09:38.250 --> 09:40.041
<i>just vanishes without a trace.</i>

09:42.375 --> 09:43.750
<i>About a week later,</i>

09:43.833 --> 09:46.958
<i>the lady who ran the laundromat,</i>
<i>she disappears too.</i>

09:48.458 --> 09:51.375
<i>Six people, just over a month,</i>

09:51.875 --> 09:52.750
<i>disappear.</i>

09:53.958 --> 09:54.916
This way!

10:02.666 --> 10:04.166
<i>My deputies and I,</i>

10:04.250 --> 10:07.583
<i>we might as well have stayed in bed,</i>
<i>all the good we did.</i>

10:10.083 --> 10:13.250
Nothing from the western leg,
even if we pull some volunteers--

10:13.333 --> 10:15.041
Over here! We found something.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.166
<i> Eventually,</i>

10:19.250 --> 10:20.250
<i>we found a body.</i>

10:40.041 --> 10:42.041
Well, open it! What are you waiting for?

10:57.875 --> 10:59.625
<i>Wasn't animal work.</i>

10:59.708 --> 11:00.958
<i>It was knife work.</i>

11:04.250 --> 11:07.500
All the edges butchered clean.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.458
But butchered meat will bleed
even after you drain it.

11:11.291 --> 11:14.250
There wasn't one goddamn drop of blood.

11:14.916 --> 11:16.750
It was pale as fish meat.

11:17.583 --> 11:18.833
A cache, then?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.083
Yeah. Yeah.

11:21.166 --> 11:25.708
Like you might put a… a pot roast
in the icebox for making sandwiches.

11:25.791 --> 11:28.041
-One more.

11:28.125 --> 11:29.958
-This arm over here.

11:30.625 --> 11:31.708
That's it.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.291
Okay, wrap him up.

11:33.791 --> 11:35.333
Tie him back up in that tree.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.750
-Yes, sir.
-You men, you're hunters?

11:38.833 --> 11:39.916
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.750
All right.
Consider yourself Posse Comitatus.

11:43.416 --> 11:45.625
Whatever left that will be back for it.

11:45.708 --> 11:49.208
-I need one of you, uh…
-Jim Dodge, sir.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.166
-Dodge?
-Yeah.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.916
Stake out that ridge over there. Will you?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.916
-Yeah, and…
-Owens.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.208
-Owens.
-Owens.

11:57.291 --> 12:01.125
Uh, we need you to cover
that area south there, all right?

12:01.208 --> 12:03.791
Oh, I think
the better spot's over there, sir.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.750
It's a better view of the path there.

12:05.833 --> 12:09.500
Yeah, well, okay. Obviously,
I've got the right man for the job.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.708
You guys will take first watch.

12:11.791 --> 12:14.208
Lawrence, Davis,
give these men your jackets.

12:14.291 --> 12:17.500
It's gonna get cold tonight.
Give them a couple radios too.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.208
<i>I took the film to be developed,</i>

12:20.291 --> 12:25.041
<i>gave the prints to Sophie to have them</i>
<i>telexed to every county in the state.</i>

12:25.125 --> 12:26.791
Okay, we're going into town.

12:26.875 --> 12:31.083
Anything happens, anything at all,
don't do a thing, just observe. Okay?

12:32.083 --> 12:33.958
We'll be back in five hours.

12:34.041 --> 12:37.000
Then a piss and a spit,
and went right back.

12:59.708 --> 13:00.541
Owens.

13:05.416 --> 13:06.291
Dodge?

13:11.833 --> 13:13.083
-Dodge.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.000
Dodge, can you hear me?

13:22.416 --> 13:23.708
Come in, Dodge.

13:28.625 --> 13:29.916
Motherfucker.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.541
No sign of them at all?

13:56.791 --> 13:59.750
I wanted to chew nails and break necks.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.875
Next morning, I got a call
from the sheriff over in Rakehell,

14:05.791 --> 14:09.250
says our corpse resembled a man
named Abel Dougherty,

14:10.166 --> 14:12.250
a mill worker over at Conwood.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.333
He'd been missing too.

14:14.833 --> 14:18.458
<i>He was last seen at a bar</i>
<i>called Trucker's Tavern</i>

14:18.541 --> 14:20.708
<i>during that onion snow we had.</i>

14:37.750 --> 14:41.583
-Maggie's Farm, my girl. With ice.
-Got it.

14:41.666 --> 14:43.583
And a Hamm's to back it up.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.791
-Right on. Trucker's.

14:50.791 --> 14:52.750
Hey, Travis! Phone!

14:53.916 --> 14:55.000
Sykes?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
-Excuse me?
-Eddie Sykes.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.750
The hell are you doing here?

15:01.833 --> 15:05.000
You got me confused with some other body.
My name's Joe Allen.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.416
The hell it is. You're Eddie Sykes.

15:08.166 --> 15:11.416
We've been working together
at Conwood for a coon's age.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.625
Where the hell you been?

15:13.708 --> 15:16.083
You either had too much
or not enough, my friend.

15:16.166 --> 15:19.583
Supposed to go angling for steelhead
two months ago. You never showed.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.291
Steelhead? I would've showed.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.041
But you didn't.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.291
Who is it you think I am again?

15:30.750 --> 15:32.291
I thought we was friends.

15:32.375 --> 15:33.791
Yeah, course we are.

15:35.125 --> 15:39.875
-Where did you go, Eddie? You just up--
-Like I said, I'm Joe Allen.

15:41.958 --> 15:43.041
You're confused.

15:45.958 --> 15:47.333
Why are you doing this?

15:49.000 --> 15:49.833
I'll tell you,

15:50.583 --> 15:51.708
but not here.

15:52.541 --> 15:56.125
Somewhere quiet.
We don't want these yokels hearing, do we?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.458
It's a secret.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.125
And we're friends, aren't we?

16:04.166 --> 16:05.000
Good

16:05.541 --> 16:06.375
friends.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.625
I mean, you said so, didn't you?

16:10.666 --> 16:12.541
Maybe we could be best friends.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.583
-I…
-Knock your beer onto the floor.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.083
Be sloppy.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.208
Call me your friend.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.041
Ask me to drive you home.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.166
Home?

16:30.291 --> 16:31.541
Do it now.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.041
-Shit, man.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.750
Look what you've done.
Maybe you need a ride.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.333
-No.
-Let's have your keys, you big oaf.

16:50.833 --> 16:51.708
Come on.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.250
I'll drive you home.

17:12.875 --> 17:16.000
Sykes was an itinerant worker.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.875
He was reported missing nine months ago.

17:19.541 --> 17:22.666
<i>Told a buddy of his</i>
<i>he was going hiking in the woods.</i>

17:23.625 --> 17:25.958
He wanted to check out a meteor shower.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.458
Never came back to work.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.708
<i>A week later, he shows up in Bailey</i>

17:45.791 --> 17:48.083
<i>under the name of Joe Allen.</i>

17:58.041 --> 18:01.000
I understand you've got
a Joe Allen staying here?

18:01.083 --> 18:05.041
Well, yes, he's at work right now,
but you're welcome to come in and…

18:06.666 --> 18:07.625
Mr. Allen!

18:09.958 --> 18:11.375
Sheriff's Department!

18:13.083 --> 18:13.916
Coming in!

18:23.000 --> 18:26.375
<i>Hey, didn't your mama</i>
<i>teach you to share?</i>

18:26.458 --> 18:28.583
<i>Sorry, not enough for you!</i>

18:28.666 --> 18:30.583
<i>I should pick you dry!</i>

18:39.416 --> 18:41.166
<i>My goodness me!</i>

18:52.041 --> 18:53.125
<i>Yo, that was good.</i>

18:53.791 --> 18:55.833
<i>But I'm still hungry!</i>

18:56.458 --> 18:58.458
<i>Yeah? So am I.</i>

19:09.583 --> 19:11.458
<i>Come</i>
<i>to the Honeycomb's hideout!</i>

19:11.541 --> 19:13.000
<i>A giant!</i>

19:13.083 --> 19:16.083
<i>I'm a big giant,</i>
<i>and I want a big cereal.</i>

19:26.583 --> 19:27.500
What is this?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.416
I'm sure I don't know.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.041
He said, that his--

19:32.125 --> 19:36.083
I saw him bringing it in,
and he said he got it in the woods.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.250
In the woods?

19:41.083 --> 19:42.166
That's right.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.541
He found it during that meteor shower.

19:45.583 --> 19:46.500
I hate it.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.458
It smells and got hairs on it.

19:50.416 --> 19:53.541
I asked him to toss it in the bin,
but he gave me such a look.

20:00.625 --> 20:03.458
Isn't there a shift change
coming up at Braddock?

20:03.541 --> 20:04.625
About ten minutes.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.291
Lawrence, this is Craven.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.791
Meet me at the Braddock Forks Mine
on the double.

20:13.875 --> 20:17.208
<i>Muster whatever deputies you can.</i>
<i>And, Sophie, call ahead.</i>

20:17.291 --> 20:21.416
<i>Suspect is a miner named Joe Allen</i>
<i>or possibly Edward Sykes.</i>

20:21.500 --> 20:22.666
<i>Soon as you get there,</i>

20:22.750 --> 20:25.666
<i>lay down a perimeter</i>
<i>and keep him buttoned the hell up.</i>

20:42.416 --> 20:46.458
You got a Joe Allen
on duty here today?

20:46.541 --> 20:48.041
Joe Allen, yeah.

20:48.125 --> 20:51.125
Uh, let's go inside and see
what we got for you, Sheriff.

21:12.958 --> 21:13.791
Sheriff?

21:18.708 --> 21:20.291
He's right there, Sheriff.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.416
Joe Allen!

21:23.208 --> 21:25.250
-Hey, you. Freeze!
-Hold it. Hold it.

21:28.291 --> 21:29.916
Hey. Hey!

21:34.041 --> 21:35.250
Get him!

21:35.958 --> 21:37.083
Hey! Hey!

21:49.833 --> 21:50.708
Which way?

21:58.625 --> 22:00.958
Hey.
What the hell are you doing?

22:01.041 --> 22:03.458
Joe?
What the fuck are you doing up there?

22:03.541 --> 22:05.416
Damn! Seal the exits!

22:07.833 --> 22:10.250
Hey. Hey! Stop that damn elevator!

22:10.333 --> 22:12.666
-Bring that thing back up here!

22:12.750 --> 22:15.958
They're headed to the 260.
I can stop them but not before the 92!

22:16.041 --> 22:18.250
I don't give a shit! Get it back up here!

22:18.333 --> 22:22.083
No way out. How could he get out
without coming back up the shaft?

22:22.166 --> 22:23.375
Outta the way!

22:59.291 --> 23:01.750
You think Allen set off the explosion?

23:01.833 --> 23:03.083
He must have.

23:03.166 --> 23:04.500
Maybe it was intentional.

23:04.583 --> 23:05.583
Maybe it wasn't.

23:06.291 --> 23:09.291
Maybe it has something to do
with that damn ball of his.

23:10.708 --> 23:12.541
No trace of that could we find, no.

23:14.250 --> 23:18.291
What I can't figure out is
how did he know that thing was in my car?

23:19.125 --> 23:21.166
He could've made it to the tree line.

23:21.250 --> 23:25.500
Instead, he fetched
that damn trophy of his. Hmm?

23:26.333 --> 23:28.041
Knowing that he was boxed in.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.583
Doesn't make any sense.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.958
Listen, Carl.

23:40.291 --> 23:41.583
I can't ask you to…

24:06.458 --> 24:07.916
How far is the river?

24:09.416 --> 24:11.000
About 100 yards or so.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.416
Good runs this time of year.

24:14.041 --> 24:17.666
I'll take you if you want to go
as soon as we get through with this mess.

24:17.750 --> 24:18.583
Yeah.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.000
I'd like that.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.166
Carl,

24:27.750 --> 24:28.708
what's going on?

24:33.583 --> 24:35.625
I have stomach cancer.

24:36.958 --> 24:38.500
Six months left, they say.

24:40.958 --> 24:41.916
Jesus.

24:42.000 --> 24:42.916
It's okay.

24:43.666 --> 24:44.791
That's how it goes.

24:45.291 --> 24:46.583
No point complaining.

24:51.208 --> 24:53.666
You've made your peace
with this thing, then?

24:54.458 --> 24:57.458
What's the alternative?
Can't do anything about it.

24:58.583 --> 25:01.125
We're all on the same conveyor belt, Nate.

25:02.625 --> 25:05.625
Some of us fall off a bit sooner
than the rest, but…

25:07.416 --> 25:10.041
we're all heading
for the same destination.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.500
Davis, this is Dr. Winters.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.541
Dr. Winters, Sheriff.
Everything's shipshape inside.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.458
How low did we get that temperature?

25:48.541 --> 25:51.208
36.
Won't go no lower. Some kind of leak.

25:51.291 --> 25:52.833
That should be cold enough.

25:54.416 --> 25:56.791
Brought a table
from the meat plant and gurneys.

25:56.875 --> 25:59.500
Thank you, Deputy Davis.
That's just fine.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.958
You can get on back. Be here sunup.

26:03.458 --> 26:06.041
I'm sorry we don't have a real facility.

26:08.041 --> 26:11.583
Brought a generator down from the mine.
And some work lights.

26:22.416 --> 26:24.250
I know it's not ideal,

26:24.333 --> 26:25.208
but…

26:28.625 --> 26:29.458
It'll work.

26:31.291 --> 26:33.750
We got you set up
as best we could there.

26:34.416 --> 26:36.041
Uh, phone's not hooked up,

26:36.125 --> 26:38.916
but there's a pay phone
down at the gas station.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.541
I couldn't have asked
for anything more, my friend.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.458
You, uh… ready to see 'em?

26:50.833 --> 26:51.666
Yeah.

26:58.916 --> 27:01.500
I told my deputies
to give you a head start

27:02.083 --> 27:03.208
with the clothes.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.541
In fact, they only got
as far as the boots, I'm afraid.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.166
I'll have to thank them.

27:15.125 --> 27:16.750
All except this guy.

27:18.875 --> 27:20.500
No one wanted to touch him.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.416
Fucking animal.

27:23.708 --> 27:26.208
I'm having crazy thoughts
with this thing, Carl.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.458
Let it lie, Nate.

27:32.708 --> 27:34.166
You need to go sleep.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.666
-Yeah. Maybe you're right.
-Mm.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.375
I don't know.
I just didn't want to leave you with this.

27:39.458 --> 27:43.041
-Are you sure you're up to this?
-Take off the badge and lie down.

27:44.416 --> 27:47.708
I'll be lucky to get through
more than just a few of them tonight.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.000
I'll press you into service
in the morning.

27:52.125 --> 27:52.958
Okay.

27:55.666 --> 27:56.500
Good night.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.541
This is Dr. Carl Winters,

28:24.625 --> 28:28.125
reporting pathologist
for the Montague County Coroner's Office,

28:28.208 --> 28:30.291
recording my preliminary remarks

28:30.375 --> 28:33.750
on the ten decedents
of the Braddock Fork Mine incident.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.875
This recording's for you alone, Nate.

28:35.958 --> 28:39.125
My typed report will serve
as the official record.

28:39.208 --> 28:44.000
The main cluster of decedents
was uncovered 30 yards from suspect Allen.

28:44.083 --> 28:48.833
Decedents Jackson and Brady
were found proximate to Allen.

28:48.916 --> 28:52.541
A man named Miller was found alone
between the two groups.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.333
If any of the bodies
contain bomb fragments,

28:56.500 --> 28:59.333
it would be this one.
I'll start with Miller.

29:25.625 --> 29:26.875
Come on.

29:56.041 --> 29:59.083
I apologize for the indignity, my friend.

29:59.166 --> 30:02.000
If it's any comfort, I'm right behind you.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.333
Me again, Nate.

30:40.416 --> 30:43.208
Despite autolysis and putrefaction,

30:43.791 --> 30:47.583
I see signs not inconsistent
with asphyxial death.

30:47.666 --> 30:52.291
I'll also examine him internally
to establish a baseline.

30:54.791 --> 30:57.625
If I see anything anomalous
on the other externals,

30:57.708 --> 31:00.583
well, we'll cross that bridge
if we come to it.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.041
There is blood-tinged mucus,

31:19.125 --> 31:21.791
expressed no doubt during his final agony.

31:26.833 --> 31:29.500
Dirt under the fingernails, split,

31:30.125 --> 31:32.333
presumably from clawing at the earth.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.958
My apologies, Mr. Miller.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.625
The lungs exhibit
subpleural ecchymosis

32:13.291 --> 32:15.541
consistent with extreme
blunt force trauma,

32:16.416 --> 32:18.166
probably from the explosion.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.916
The right half of the heart is distended
and engorged with dark blood,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.750
along with the right coronary artery.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.458
This is good, Nate.

32:30.541 --> 32:34.416
I see signs of respiratory distress,
concussive trauma,

32:34.500 --> 32:36.291
but nothing says "bomb" to me,

32:36.375 --> 32:40.333
nothing to prevent
a finding of death by crush asphyxiation.

32:40.416 --> 32:44.416
-Nothing for Waddleton to salivate over.

33:20.958 --> 33:24.083
Run. Get out. Now.

33:27.250 --> 33:28.333
Run from what?

34:06.416 --> 34:07.708
New external, Nate.

34:07.791 --> 34:09.666
One Walter Lou Jackson.

34:11.208 --> 34:15.250
Per your photos,
Jackson was unearthed next to Allen.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.458
Nate, I keep thinking…

34:20.291 --> 34:23.500
What if the explosion
wasn't a botched escape attempt?

34:23.583 --> 34:26.875
What if that sphere wasn't a bomb?

34:28.833 --> 34:32.333
What if the sphere's destruction
was Allen's actual aim?

34:34.083 --> 34:35.083
Not escape?

34:53.875 --> 34:57.750
I found a small wound
at the bottom of Jackson's sternum.

34:59.333 --> 35:00.208
It's deep.

35:01.375 --> 35:03.958
Seems to curve through the diaphragm…

35:05.458 --> 35:06.458
…toward the heart.

35:17.375 --> 35:21.583
Forgive me, friend.
My curiosity necessitates opening you up.

35:34.041 --> 35:34.916
Oh.

35:38.041 --> 35:40.166
The track of the wound
does lead to the heart.

35:40.250 --> 35:43.083
The lungs and heart are shrunken
and abnormally pale.

35:45.958 --> 35:48.125
Completely drained of blood.

37:34.416 --> 37:36.375
There's no blood in Brady either.

37:46.666 --> 37:48.166
Jackson, Brady…

37:53.333 --> 37:54.166
Allen.

38:26.958 --> 38:29.083
I'm thinking crazy thoughts, Nate.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.250
I'm thinking…

38:32.541 --> 38:35.375
I wonder if all that blood's
in Allen's stomach.

38:42.708 --> 38:43.875
I'll examine him.

40:49.250 --> 40:50.416
Help me.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.500
Trapped in this…

40:55.458 --> 40:56.375
flesh.

40:56.875 --> 40:57.833
Starving.

40:59.458 --> 41:00.833
What are you?

41:00.916 --> 41:01.833
I'm a traveler.

41:03.875 --> 41:05.791
-Not of Earth.
-I don't--

41:05.875 --> 41:07.750
My true form is small.

41:08.416 --> 41:09.333
Shape…

41:10.083 --> 41:11.208
hideous to you.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.416
I feared death.

41:14.625 --> 41:15.875
The cave-in.

41:15.958 --> 41:18.166
-Death was your escape.

41:20.791 --> 41:22.375
Maybe you don't need oxygen.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.083
A lesser component of our metabolism.

41:36.791 --> 41:38.291
Was the sphere…

41:38.375 --> 41:39.375
My ship?

41:40.291 --> 41:44.250
Its destruction is our first duty
facing discovery.

41:45.916 --> 41:49.083
There was no chance to re-enter.
Leaving this takes too long.

41:49.166 --> 41:52.291
So in the shaft was my only chance.

41:53.041 --> 41:54.791
Why must your ship be destroyed?

41:55.791 --> 41:57.625
We must not be understood.

41:58.125 --> 41:58.958
Why not?

42:00.375 --> 42:01.875
Put down the knife.

42:03.583 --> 42:04.833
Do it now.

42:04.916 --> 42:06.833
For we are friends, Doctor.

42:06.916 --> 42:10.416
Livestock must not understand
what devours it?

42:10.500 --> 42:14.416
Oh, fret not.
You will understand what devours you.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.708
That is essential.

42:19.750 --> 42:22.833
I can smell your cancer, Doctor.

42:22.916 --> 42:25.416
It is delicious.

42:26.833 --> 42:31.333
Come, let me rid you of it.
I will love you.

42:33.250 --> 42:37.000
That body will be your coffin.
I'll see you buried in it.

43:14.375 --> 43:15.750
It's rotten blood.

43:16.375 --> 43:17.500
Thin nourishment.

43:18.500 --> 43:21.583
Animating this and synapsing with you
is high cost.

43:21.666 --> 43:24.791
Once you and I are one,
I will be near starvation again.

43:58.791 --> 44:02.666
-But you are a prize host, Dr. Winters.

44:03.333 --> 44:06.875
Through you, I can feed
even when killing is too dangerous.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.416
Meals are delivered to you still warm.

44:11.875 --> 44:14.333
What the hell are you doing?

44:14.416 --> 44:19.166
Well, we mustn't raise suspicion.
The cut must be forensically correct.

44:24.250 --> 44:28.000
Have to be careful of the pectoral muscles
or I'll lose the use of these arms.

44:35.166 --> 44:36.416
Why is my arm free?

44:37.000 --> 44:40.208
Final neural splicing requires
a sensory-motor standard

44:40.291 --> 44:42.166
to perfect my brain's fit to yours.

44:43.333 --> 44:47.750
The rest of you is paralyzed,
but once this is done I will unbind you,

44:47.833 --> 44:49.958
and we will be free together.

44:52.291 --> 44:54.333
You're going to transfer yourself

44:54.958 --> 44:56.666
from Allen into me?

44:58.041 --> 44:58.875
Correct.

45:00.625 --> 45:01.458
How?

45:02.375 --> 45:04.791
Well, normally via the alimentary canal.

45:06.500 --> 45:07.875
<i>You see, over eons,</i>

45:07.958 --> 45:14.125
<i>we have become perfectly streamlined</i>
<i>to facilitate our entry into other beings.</i>

45:14.208 --> 45:18.208
<i>As a larva,</i>
<i>I entered Eddie Sykes’ mouth as he slept.</i>

45:18.875 --> 45:20.916
<i>But I've grown since then.</i>

45:21.583 --> 45:23.458
<i>Oh, how I have grown.</i>

45:24.083 --> 45:26.125
<i>We will have to make an incision.</i>

45:27.458 --> 45:31.500
<i>You're going to use</i>
<i>your puppet there to pluck you out.</i>

45:32.250 --> 45:34.166
<i>But once he's dislodged you,</i>

45:35.083 --> 45:36.875
<i>won't he go limp and drop you?</i>

45:38.333 --> 45:40.958
<i>I am quite more familiar</i>
<i>with your physiology</i>

45:41.041 --> 45:42.666
<i>than even you, Doctor.</i>

45:43.458 --> 45:46.291
<i>I know what I can and cannot cut.</i>

45:49.333 --> 45:53.666
The most supreme adaptations
are purchased at the cost of inessentials.

45:53.750 --> 45:58.125
Our hosts already carry structures
for sight, sound, smell, locomotion.

45:58.875 --> 46:02.416
It'd be quite redundant
to carry those capacities ourselves.

46:03.041 --> 46:04.625
So we travel light.

46:04.708 --> 46:07.958
No quaint fins or stalks or feathers

46:08.041 --> 46:09.791
terminating in hooks or…

46:10.333 --> 46:12.000
suckers or little digits.

46:12.750 --> 46:14.458
We've no use for any of it,

46:15.000 --> 46:16.416
for we have transcended.

46:19.791 --> 46:21.541
Have I amused you, Doctor?

46:22.458 --> 46:24.500
You are truly self-deluded.

46:25.250 --> 46:26.958
You're stalling for time.

46:27.041 --> 46:28.500
It's already too late.

46:29.083 --> 46:31.166
You really don't see it, do you?

46:31.250 --> 46:33.458
-See what?
-You're jealous.

46:35.375 --> 46:36.291
Absurd.

46:36.375 --> 46:38.500
You have no senses of your own.

46:39.125 --> 46:41.000
You have to steal them from others.

46:41.083 --> 46:43.250
We have inhabited men for millennia.

46:44.291 --> 46:46.625
We have caused great nations to fall.

46:48.375 --> 46:51.291
-We have shaped–
-You've stolen everything you ever had.

46:51.791 --> 46:55.791
You're nothing but a thief and murderer.
A parasite. You're pathetic.

46:56.291 --> 46:59.125
You're nothing but cancer
with a big mouth.

47:00.583 --> 47:02.750
Your friend, the sheriff, will come soon.

47:03.500 --> 47:05.000
Sunup, I believe.

47:05.916 --> 47:08.708
He will make a fine first meal for us.

47:09.458 --> 47:11.375
His flesh will nurture our body,

47:11.458 --> 47:15.333
and your anguish as we consume him
will nurture my soul.

47:15.416 --> 47:18.583
To say nothing at all of his.

47:20.875 --> 47:23.000
Now where will we begin?

47:23.583 --> 47:25.500
You know, it's a curious problem.

47:25.583 --> 47:29.583
With careful flensing
of the superior and inferior extremities,

47:29.666 --> 47:34.166
leaving the primary arteries intact,
a man can live for hours.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.958
Oh, you can harvest meat all the way
to the coxal region before he dies.

47:39.583 --> 47:41.208
He offers up his pain

47:41.291 --> 47:43.083
along with his protein.

47:43.166 --> 47:46.250
Finally, we can harvest
the arteries at our leisure.

47:46.833 --> 47:50.958
But of course, the, uh,
flesh of the extremities is tough.

47:51.666 --> 47:53.083
Now aside from the rump,

47:53.166 --> 47:55.958
the organs are most toothsome,

47:56.708 --> 47:58.916
but bring death much faster.

47:59.916 --> 48:02.791
You think about it.
Let me know which you prefer.

48:03.833 --> 48:04.833
Either way,

48:04.916 --> 48:08.500
as I use your hands
to haul forth his smoking entrails,

48:08.583 --> 48:10.875
and your mouth to guzzle them down,

48:10.958 --> 48:17.083
the repeated orgasms that we will have
with your loins will be astounding.

48:19.125 --> 48:21.833
You called yourselves our livestock,

48:22.666 --> 48:24.583
but you're so much more.

48:25.458 --> 48:29.375
I could've eked two weeks out
of Brady and Jackson if that was all.

48:29.958 --> 48:33.208
But I reinvested
half the energy their blood gave me

48:33.708 --> 48:35.583
to keep their brains alive.

48:36.125 --> 48:40.458
That way I could whisper directly
into their eighth cranial nerves.

48:40.541 --> 48:45.416
Just to make sure they understood
everything that I was doing to them.

48:46.791 --> 48:47.916
And Eddie Sykes?

48:48.750 --> 48:51.916
Oh, yes.
He is here with us right now.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.083
Mute and powerless

48:54.791 --> 48:56.375
as I disembowel him.

49:03.458 --> 49:05.000
You're forgetting something.

49:05.916 --> 49:07.666
I forget nothing.

49:09.083 --> 49:11.541
Your arrogance makes you stupid.

49:11.625 --> 49:14.916
What have I forgotten, sweet doctor?

49:16.708 --> 49:17.666
Never mind.

49:18.875 --> 49:23.125
I will know every thought
in your head in just a few moments,

49:24.125 --> 49:27.833
all your memories, your senses.

49:28.583 --> 49:30.125
-And your fear.

49:30.916 --> 49:32.625
Your suffering…

49:35.166 --> 49:37.458
all mine.

49:46.041 --> 49:48.458
All mine.

50:23.250 --> 50:24.833
All mine.

50:46.625 --> 50:50.500
Sykes knew you'd be blind and deaf
once you were out of him,

50:50.583 --> 50:52.791
you sadistic bastard.

50:55.333 --> 50:56.458
Oh!

50:57.458 --> 50:58.375
Here.

51:06.375 --> 51:08.208
There must… there must be a way.

51:12.208 --> 51:14.833
-Not to survive, but…

53:26.375 --> 53:27.750
What have you done?

53:28.250 --> 53:32.583
We're communicating through
my eighth cranial nerve now, right?

53:32.666 --> 53:34.125
Where am I?

53:34.625 --> 53:39.250
You are in your new home,
but you won't be occupying it for long.

53:39.791 --> 53:42.416
There's been some vandalism, I'm afraid.

53:42.500 --> 53:43.833
The lights don't work.

53:43.916 --> 53:47.291
You'll also find
the neighborhood a bit quiet.

53:47.875 --> 53:49.875
I can still make you move.

53:52.125 --> 53:54.666
<i>We will await your friend's arrival.</i>

53:55.708 --> 53:57.541
And when he comes close, I will--

53:58.208 --> 54:02.208
I should mention
the plumbing has a terminal leak.

54:04.041 --> 54:08.166
You only have
a few more minutes before I bleed out.

54:09.125 --> 54:11.625
I will live.

54:16.791 --> 54:18.916
I will live.

54:21.458 --> 54:24.041
Wouldn't you like
to know what you forgot?

54:25.083 --> 54:29.291
The whole time you were forcing
poor Sykes to slice himself up,

54:29.375 --> 54:31.083
you were being recorded.

54:31.166 --> 54:32.166
No.

54:32.250 --> 54:34.166
My tape machine was running.

54:34.250 --> 54:35.625
Oh no, no, no, no.

54:35.708 --> 54:37.583
The tape ran out a while ago,

54:38.125 --> 54:40.416
but I'm sure the portion that's left

54:40.916 --> 54:45.625
will make for interesting listening
when my friend arrives.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.625
Let me out!

55:23.791 --> 55:24.625
Carl.

55:52.083 --> 55:53.833
<i>This is Dr. Carl Winters,</i>

55:53.916 --> 55:57.041
<i>reporting pathologist</i>
<i>for the Montague County Coroner's Office.</i>

55:57.125 --> 55:59.500
<i>I'm leaving this recording</i>
<i>for you alone, Nate.</i>

55:59.583 --> 56:02.750
<i>My typed report will serve</i>
<i>as the official record…</i>
