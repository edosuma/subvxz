WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:08.476
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.644
Jake:
WE WERE WATCHING TV,
AND I SAID,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.980
"I DON'T THINK
THIS PREGNANCY'S
WORTH FIGHTING OVER."

00:13.081 --> 00:15.416
AND I SAID,
"I THINK I MIGHT
WANT THIS BABY.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.619
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WOULD EVER BE ABLE
TO GET PREGNANT AGAIN."

00:22.556 --> 00:24.425
AMY, LET ME IN.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.461
WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

00:27.561 --> 00:31.199
- I'M SEEING SOMEONE.
- WHO THE FUCK IS HE?!

00:31.299 --> 00:33.401
WHAT REALLY GETS ME

00:33.501 --> 00:35.303
IS THAT YOU CAN GO
TO THIS GUY'S PLACE

00:35.403 --> 00:37.471
AND THEN YOU CAN
COME HOME HERE

00:37.571 --> 00:40.641
ALL WET AND FLUSHED
AND EXCITED AND HORNY,

00:40.741 --> 00:43.711
AND YOU CAN SIT DOWN
WITH OUR SON AND DO
HIS HOMEWORK.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.013
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

00:46.114 --> 00:48.816
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE SHIT.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.724
- HI.
- HELLO, AMY.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.374
SO HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

01:13.474 --> 01:16.544
FINE.
THANKS FOR CALLING.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.653
NO JAKE?

01:25.753 --> 01:28.122
( theme music playing )

01:45.706 --> 01:48.709
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU BOTH
AT THE BEGINNING

01:48.809 --> 01:50.578
THAT IN COUPLES' THERAPY,

01:50.678 --> 01:52.946
WE DON'T MEET ALONE

01:53.046 --> 01:55.383
UNLESS THE THIRD
PARTY AGREES?

01:55.483 --> 01:58.752
WHAT IF I WANT
PRIVATE SESSIONS?

02:01.689 --> 02:04.558
YOU MEAN
YOU WANT TO BEGIN
INDIVIDUAL THERAPY?

02:04.658 --> 02:06.727
YEAH.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.096
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF IT WASN'T WITH ME.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.865
( laughs )
WHY?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.801
- ARE YOU AFRAID
OF JAKE?
- NO.

02:13.901 --> 02:14.968
SHOULD I BE?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.870
WHY THEN?

02:16.970 --> 02:20.007
WELL, IT'S--

02:20.107 --> 02:22.776
IT'S LIKE THREE FRIENDS
WHO GO TO A RESTAURANT
FOR DINNER,

02:22.876 --> 02:25.546
AND THEN TWO OF US DECIDE
THAT WE'RE GONNA GO
TO A MOVIE

02:25.646 --> 02:27.448
WITHOUT TELLING
THE THIRD PERSON.

02:27.548 --> 02:32.052
ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO A MOVIE?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.988
I THINK WE HAVE
TO AGREE THAT JAKE
CAN HEAR EVERYTHING

02:35.088 --> 02:37.225
THAT WE SAY HERE.

02:37.325 --> 02:40.394
OKAY, FINE.
IT'S COUPLES' THERAPY.

02:40.494 --> 02:44.198
JAKE'S ENTITLED TO HEAR
WHATEVER WE SAY.
THAT'S GREAT.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.834
( cell phone ringing )

02:52.706 --> 02:54.675
SORRY.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.844
( ringing stops )

03:00.848 --> 03:03.451
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL?

03:03.551 --> 03:07.721
FINE.
WERE YOU WORRIED?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.423
YES, VERY.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.124
REALLY?
YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME?

03:11.225 --> 03:13.694
ARE YOU SURPRISED
ABOUT THAT?

03:13.794 --> 03:16.364
IT'S NICE TO HEAR.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.031
DID YOU WORRY
ABOUT JAKE TOO?

03:18.131 --> 03:20.434
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU BOTH,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.537
WHO DID YOU
WORRY ABOUT MORE?

03:23.637 --> 03:26.039
SEE, HE IS HERE.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.809
( chuckles )

03:33.180 --> 03:36.149
ACTUALLY, I WORRIED
ABOUT YOU MORE,

03:36.250 --> 03:38.519
BECAUSE YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WENT THROUGH IT--

03:38.619 --> 03:41.522
PHYSICALLY.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.958
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I FEEL GREAT.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.661
I FEEL TOO GOOD.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.331
- TOO GOOD?
- YEAH, I FEEL
REALLY REALLY GOOD.

03:50.431 --> 03:54.468
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.305
I FEEL HAPPY.
I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE ENERGY.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.006
I FEEL LIKE
DOING THINGS.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.141
I FEEL LIKE
PUTTING ON MAKEUP
AND GOING OUT DANCING.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.712
( sighs )

04:04.812 --> 04:07.180
YOU THINK I'M A MONSTER.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.149
- NO.
- JUST A LITTLE BIT?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.851
NO, NOT AT ALL.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.654
WELL, JAKE HATES ME.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.923
HE HATES YOU TOO.
HE THINKS WE CONSPIRED
AGAINST HIM.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.891
HE'LL NEVER
COME HERE AGAIN.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.027
DID YOU TELL HIM
YOU WERE COMING?

04:20.127 --> 04:21.795
NO, HE DOESN'T
WANT ME COMING HERE.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.197
DO YOU FEEL
THE NEED TO HIDE THINGS
FROM HIM AGAIN?

04:24.298 --> 04:27.601
I DIDN'T HAVE
THE ENERGY TO ARGUE.
I DON'T KNOW.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.304
HE PROBABLY WANTS ME
TO FEEL AWFUL AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED,

04:30.404 --> 04:33.173
AND HE KNOWS
THAT YOU'LL HELP ME
NOT FEEL LIKE THAT.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.075
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

04:35.175 --> 04:37.711
FOR ME TO HELP YOU
NOT TO FEEL AWFUL?

04:37.811 --> 04:40.280
ACTUALLY, NO,
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

04:40.381 --> 04:44.184
I CAME HERE
BECAUSE I'M NOT
FEELING BAD ENOUGH.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.387
AND YOU FEEL
BAD ABOUT THAT?

04:46.487 --> 04:49.256
YEAH, I MEAN,
A WOMAN WHO LOSES A BABY

04:49.357 --> 04:51.592
SHOULD FEEL GRIEF, RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT'S EXPECTED.

04:51.692 --> 04:55.463
WELL, PERHAPS YOU JUST
FEEL RELIEVED.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.731
I MEAN, AFTER ALL
YOUR CONCERNS--

04:57.831 --> 05:00.233
I HAD NO CONCERNS.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.736
I DIDN'T WANT IT.

05:03.871 --> 05:07.107
SO WHY DOES FEELING
GOOD SURPRISE YOU?

05:07.207 --> 05:10.243
IT ISN'T SURPRISING

05:10.344 --> 05:12.012
AS MUCH AS
IT'S DISTURBING.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.781
YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, WHAT--

05:13.881 --> 05:16.650
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
DON'T I HAVE FEELINGS?

05:25.292 --> 05:28.328
WHY ARE YOU SILENT?

05:28.429 --> 05:31.064
YOU THINK I DON'T
HAVE FEELINGS?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.766
NO, I--

05:32.866 --> 05:35.536
THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS
ACCUSATION, DOCTOR.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.906
THAT IS NOT
WHAT I THINK.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.841
BUT YOU WERE SILENT.
AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.944
ARE YOU TRYING
TO PICK A FIGHT
WITH ME?

05:44.044 --> 05:46.313
NO.

05:46.414 --> 05:50.183
BECAUSE
SOMETIMES I FEEL

05:50.283 --> 05:53.253
THAT YOU NEED
TO BE DEFIANT,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.389
THAT YOU NEED
TO OPPOSE

05:55.489 --> 05:57.558
- AND BE OPPOSED.
- OPPOSE WHAT?

05:57.658 --> 06:01.128
I DON'T KNOW.
YOUR HUSBAND, ME...

06:01.228 --> 06:05.198
A SOCIETY THAT DECIDES
A WOMAN SHOULD DESPERATELY
WANT A CHILD,

06:05.298 --> 06:07.535
THAT DECIDES A WOMAN
SHOULD MOURN

06:07.635 --> 06:09.637
WHEN SHE MISCARRIES.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.506
IT'S A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING, YOU KNOW,

06:12.606 --> 06:15.108
WHEN YOU START
PLAYING THE SHRINK.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.579
YOU'VE SUDDENLY
GOT ALL CHATTY.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.948
IT'S VERY VERY
UNALPHA-MALE OF YOU.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.784
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT I'M UNALPHA-MALE?

06:23.884 --> 06:26.086
IT SHOULD BOTHER YOU.
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.688
IT'S TOO BAD,
ACTUALLY,

06:27.788 --> 06:29.923
BECAUSE YOU COULD
LOOK PRETTY GOOD.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.260
I MEAN, UNDER
THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU COULD BE HANDSOME EVEN.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.263
UNDER WHAT
CIRCUMSTANCES?

06:36.363 --> 06:38.599
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

06:38.699 --> 06:42.069
ON A DESERT ISLAND
WHEN I'M UNCONSCIOUS.

06:42.169 --> 06:46.339
( laughs )

06:46.440 --> 06:49.610
I'M JUST KIDDING.
YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.979
( cell phone ringing )

06:55.649 --> 06:59.219
- IS THAT JAKE?
- YEP.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.490
WHERE DOES
HE THINK YOU ARE?

07:02.590 --> 07:05.358
WHO KNOWS.
MAYBE FUCKING REEVES.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.927
- YOUR BOSS?
- MM-HMM.

07:07.027 --> 07:10.464
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET HIM THINK THAT.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.734
IS HE ATTRACTED
TO YOU, REEVES?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.537
- WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

07:16.637 --> 07:19.740
DOCTOR, I'M
A MARRIED WOMAN.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.977
SO WHY IS JAKE
SO WORRIED ABOUT
YOU AND REEVES?

07:24.077 --> 07:27.581
HE'S SCARED.

07:27.681 --> 07:31.819
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

07:31.919 --> 07:33.854
WHAT ABOUT ME?

07:33.954 --> 07:37.791
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ME?

07:42.429 --> 07:45.198
I THINK YOU'RE
FLIRTING WITH ME.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.904
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD I DO THAT?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.774
I DON'T KNOW.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.375
MAYBE KEEP JAKE
ON HIS TOES,

07:55.475 --> 07:58.078
LIKE WITH REEVES.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.083
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.427
ARE YOU ANNOYED
WITH ME?

08:14.528 --> 08:18.398
NO, I DON'T
FEEL ANYTHING.
REMEMBER?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.234
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I UPSET YOU,
THAT'S ALL.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.205
NO, I'M NOT UPSET.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.241
I'M JUST BORED.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.789
WHERE'S THE STAIN?

08:44.457 --> 08:45.959
I SAW IT WHEN
WE LEFT HERE.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.828
YOU MUST HAVE
SCRUBBED THE COUCH
LIKE A LUNATIC.

08:49.496 --> 08:52.132
ACTUALLY, IT CAME OFF
QUITE EASILY.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.937
OH, HMM.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.372
I'M SURPRISED.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.209
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
DOWN ON ALL FOURS

09:02.309 --> 09:04.111
SCRUBBING AWAY

09:04.211 --> 09:06.680
AND YOUR WIFE
STANDING OVER YOU
SHOUTING INSTRUCTIONS,

09:06.780 --> 09:09.082
AND YOU WIPING THE SWEAT
FROM YOUR BROW SAYING,

09:09.182 --> 09:10.618
"IT'S NOT COMING OUT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.753
MY NEXT PATIENT WILL
BE HERE ANY MINUTE."

09:17.090 --> 09:20.761
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD COME OUT
THAT EASILY, THAT'S ALL.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.600
DID YOU WANT IT
TO STILL BE THERE?

09:26.700 --> 09:29.169
YES, I WAS VERY
ATTACHED TO IT.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.939
WHERE'S YOUR
SENSE OF HUMOR?
COME ON.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.342
WELL, I GUESS

09:35.442 --> 09:38.746
I DON'T FIND IT
SO FUNNY.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.784
I THINK YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTED.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.820
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL
OUT OF IT?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.489
WHAT WERE YOU
EXPECTING TO FEEL
WHEN YOU SAW IT?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.092
NOTHING.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.928
NO SADNESS?

09:59.132 --> 10:01.501
NO GRIEF?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.737
OVER A STAIN?

10:03.837 --> 10:05.372
NO.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.909
OVER THE LOSS
OF YOUR BABY.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.783
MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO SEE THAT STAIN

10:15.883 --> 10:18.952
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED
TO ACCEPT IT

10:19.052 --> 10:22.622
AND ALL OF
THE MIXED FEELINGS

10:22.723 --> 10:24.658
YOU HAVE ABOUT IT.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.936
( door opens )

11:11.138 --> 11:13.406
HELLO, JAKE.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.943
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT.

11:17.778 --> 11:21.048
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:21.148 --> 11:24.684
IT'S COUPLES'
COUNSELING,
ISN'T IT?

11:24.785 --> 11:27.187
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T COMING BACK.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.521
NO.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.691
"WE" WEREN'T
COMING BACK.
REMEMBER?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.694
I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO PAUL ALONE

11:34.795 --> 11:37.230
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.
WERE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

11:37.330 --> 11:40.300
NO.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.936
YOU THINK I WAS
FOLLOWING YOU?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.105
NO.

11:45.205 --> 11:49.276
SHOULD I BE
FOLLOWING YOU?

11:59.019 --> 12:01.521
SO WHAT WERE YOU
JUST TALKING ABOUT?

12:01.621 --> 12:03.023
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD
TO HIM LAST WEEK

12:03.123 --> 12:05.392
- WHILE WE
WAITED FOR YOU.
- TWO WEEKS AGO.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.494
TWO WEEKS, WHATEVER.
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.
WE WAITED 15 MINUTES FOR YOU.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.162
YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T COMING, SO--

12:09.262 --> 12:11.398
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.
I'M HERE, OKAY?

12:17.637 --> 12:20.740
WHAT'S THAT?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.211
I'M NOT PREGNANT
ANYMORE.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.146
WHY DOES EVERYTHING
THAT COMES OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH

12:26.246 --> 12:28.281
- SOUND LIKE
AN ACCUSATION?
- ACCUSATION?

12:28.381 --> 12:29.749
YEAH, YOU INTERROGATE ME,

12:29.850 --> 12:32.019
AND THEN WHATEVER
I SAY OR DO, I'M GUILTY.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.921
I CAN'T WIN WITH YOU.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.989
DOC, MY WIFE'S PARANOID.
CAN YOU TREAT THAT?

12:36.089 --> 12:39.526
OH JAKE, YOU'RE SO CRASS
IT'S FRIGHTENING.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.463
SO HOW ARE YOU, PAUL?

12:43.563 --> 12:46.466
I'M QUITE WELL.
THANK YOU, JAKE.

12:46.566 --> 12:51.004
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.541
YOU'RE VERY QUIET TODAY.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.877
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

12:56.977 --> 13:00.447
YOU'RE HERE TO JUST NOD
YOUR HEAD AND DO A LITTLE
DAMAGE FROM TIME TO TIME.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.850
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN "DAMAGE"?

13:02.950 --> 13:05.418
I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T HERE.
YOU WERE TALKING TO AMY.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.956
MM-HMM.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.859
SO YOU'RE HERE
TO SURVEY THE DAMAGE?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.726
I'M HERE
BECAUSE SHE'S HERE.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.395
NOT FOR YOURSELF?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.397
DOES IT BOTHER
YOU THAT I'M HERE?
BECAUSE I'M PAYING,

13:17.497 --> 13:18.966
SO I DON'T REALLY CARE
IF IT BOTHERS YOU OR NOT.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.500
YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE
TALKING ABOUT MONEY.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.035
IT'S NOT HIS MONEY.
IT'S MINE.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.436
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.538
EVERYTHING
IS YOURS, RIGHT?

13:25.638 --> 13:29.242
THE MONEY IS YOURS,
THE PREGNANCY IS YOURS,
THE MISCARRIAGE IS YOURS.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.510
EVERYTHING IS YOURS.

13:30.610 --> 13:34.247
DO YOU FEEL IT'S DAMAGING
FOR AMY TO TALK TO ME?

13:34.347 --> 13:37.084
WELL, IF SHE LEAVES OUR CHILD
ON YOUR COUCH, IT IS.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.730
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

13:50.830 --> 13:53.867
WITH AMY'S
PREGNANCY, JAKE?

13:53.967 --> 13:56.469
I FEEL LIKE SHIT.

13:56.569 --> 14:00.073
Paul:
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.509
NO.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.945
AMY?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.747
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT
WITH HIM HERE.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.717
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU
GOT TO HIDE?

14:10.817 --> 14:13.820
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
INSANE, DON'T YOU?

14:13.921 --> 14:17.224
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M HIDING?

14:22.095 --> 14:25.698
AMY, DO YOU SEE
HOW YOUR BEHAVIOR
MIGHT SOMETIMES ENCOURAGE

14:25.798 --> 14:28.969
JAKE'S SUSPICIONS?

14:34.341 --> 14:37.945
DID SHE MAKE
A PASS AT YOU?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.581
WHAT IF I DID?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.250
YOU'RE HITTING
ON OUR THERAPIST TOO?

14:43.350 --> 14:46.353
YOU ARE FUCKING
UNBELIEVABLE.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.422
WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S A DOCTOR?
HE COULD BE YOUR FATHER.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.059
- SORRY, PAUL.
- DON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

14:52.159 --> 14:54.161
Amy:
WHY ARE YOU SO
THREATENED BY PAUL?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.596
I'M NOT THREATENED BY PAUL.
HE DOESN'T WORRY ME.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.265
YOUR COMPULSION
WORRIES ME.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.832
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"COMPULSION"?

14:59.933 --> 15:02.669
- SHE KNOWS.
- NO, I'M ASKING YOU.

15:06.206 --> 15:10.010
A COMPULSION
TO COME ON TO MEN.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.613
AND DO YOU THINK
THAT'S A PATTERN?

15:13.713 --> 15:16.916
- YEAH.
- WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE DOES THAT?

15:17.017 --> 15:19.119
- ASK HER.
- NO, I'M ASKING YOU.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.592
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
BEHAVE LIKE THAT WHEN
THEY FEEL TRAPPED

15:25.692 --> 15:28.161
- IN A RELATIONSHIP.
- IS THAT WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

15:28.261 --> 15:31.631
I'M ASKING YOU, JAKE.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.334
WHY DOES SHE WANT
TO FUCK REEVES?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.644
SHE LOVES AUTHORITY.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.013
Paul:
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.647
ARE YOU NOT
AUTHORITATIVE?

15:47.747 --> 15:51.484
AUTHORITATIVE
AND AUTHORITY AREN'T
THE SAME THING.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.191
THERE MUST HAVE
BEEN OTHER BOSSES
BEFORE REEVES.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.893
WAS JAKE JEALOUS
OF THEM TOO, AMY?

16:00.994 --> 16:02.695
NO.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.366
- WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT REEVES?
- IT'S NOT ABOUT REEVES.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.701
IT'S ABOUT HER.
SHE'S CHANGED.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.570
IN WHAT WAY?

16:10.670 --> 16:14.841
SHE DIDN'T USED TO HAVE
THAT LOOK IN HER EYE.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.977
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "LOOK"?

16:18.078 --> 16:19.479
THAT LOOK.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.050
RIGHT THERE.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.253
ON THE PROWL.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.060
SHE'S OUT OF CONTROL.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.861
Paul:
IS IT POSSIBLE

16:34.961 --> 16:37.497
THAT AMY'S PREGNANCY
WAS A CHANCE

16:37.597 --> 16:39.832
FOR YOU
TO CONTROL HER?

16:39.932 --> 16:42.902
A PREGNANCY, A BABY--
IT'S NOT THAT EASY
TO GET OUT

16:43.002 --> 16:45.038
"ON THE PROWL"
AS YOU PUT IT.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.373
SHE'S MUCH MORE
RESTRICTED,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.608
PERHAPS LIKE
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS

16:48.708 --> 16:51.411
WHEN LENNY WAS A BABY,
AND SHE WAS MORE--

16:51.511 --> 16:53.546
HOUSE-BROKEN, TAMED,
BRAIN-DEAD.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.183
DO YOU KNOW
THAT I GOT PREGNANT
A MONTH AFTER WE MET?

16:56.283 --> 16:58.185
I GAVE UP MY FREEDOM
THE DAY I MET YOU.

16:58.285 --> 17:01.288
I WOULD LIKE TO PAY YOU, PAUL.
I DON'T THINK WE PAID FOR
THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.624
WE DO HAVE
A FEW MINUTES.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.060
I'M LEAVING.
SHIT, I CAN'T FIND
MY CHECKBOOK.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.796
- YOU'RE LEAVING WITHOUT ME?
- I CAME WITHOUT YOU.
WHERE IS IT?

17:09.896 --> 17:12.199
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.
SORRY, PAUL.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.334
- WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL BE HOME?
- WE'LL SEE.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.138
- HOW ABOUT LENNY'S DINNER?
- HOW ABOUT HIS LOVING FATHER
COOKS DINNER FOR HIM?

17:18.238 --> 17:19.639
I SAID,
"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?"

17:19.739 --> 17:22.309
YOU SHIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"ON THE PROWL"?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.577
WHAT AM I?
SOME FUCKING
ANIMAL IN HEAT?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.047
I'M GLAD I'M NOT
PREGNANT ANYMORE.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.049
REALLY?
YOU'RE GLAD
OUR BABY DIED?

17:30.150 --> 17:33.886
YES YES, AND I'M NOT
GOING TO GO AROUND LOOKING
SAD FOR YOU ANYMORE.

17:33.986 --> 17:37.624
I DIDN'T WANT THIS BABY,
AND, MAN, FUCKING HELL,
I KNOW WHY.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.476
WAS IT THREE SESSIONS?

17:56.576 --> 17:59.546
LOOK, JAKE,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE CAN SORT THIS OUT NEXT WEEK.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.081
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.817
I OWE YOU $80.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.786
THIS HAS BEEN
REALLY GREAT, PAUL.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.589
A COUPLE MORE OF THESE
AND WE CAN TRADE YOU IN FOR
A GOOD DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.692
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
START COMING HERE BEFORE
THAT HAPPENS, JAKE.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.828
AS YOU SAID YOURSELF,
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR AMY,

18:15.928 --> 18:18.331
NOT FOR YOURSELF.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.202
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
COMING BACK HERE FOR YOU.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.256
( soft jazz playing )

19:08.715 --> 19:11.718
( knocks )

19:15.555 --> 19:17.690
HEY, I HEARD MUSIC.
ARE YOU DONE?

19:21.394 --> 19:23.463
ARE YOU GOING OUT?

19:23.563 --> 19:26.899
NO, I'M--
WELL, I'M GOING
TO CAROLINE'S

19:26.999 --> 19:29.369
BECAUSE SHE ASKED ME
TO COME OVER AND GIVE
HER SOME ADVICE.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.103
THEY'RE REDECORATING.

19:31.204 --> 19:35.875
YOU GOT A NEW CAREER.
OH, GREAT.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.745
SHE LIKES MY TASTE.
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

19:41.581 --> 19:43.683
IS THERE ANYTHING TO EAT?

19:47.587 --> 19:49.522
NO, PAUL,
YOU CAN ORDER IN.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.658
YOU'RE REALLY LOSING IT.
YOU KNOW THAT?

19:51.758 --> 19:54.160
WHY'S THAT?
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU TO EAT?

19:54.261 --> 19:57.096
NO, BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN HOME A SINGLE
NIGHT THIS WEEK.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.798
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR KIDS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.967
MAYBE THEY'LL SUDDENLY
DISCOVER THEY HAVE
A FATHER.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.470
OH, YOU'RE DOING
THIS FOR THEM?

20:03.570 --> 20:05.405
YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR
SO THAT THEY CAN

20:05.505 --> 20:07.240
REDISCOVER THEIR FATHER.
HMMM.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.343
NO, I'M DOING IT FOR ME.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.179
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ACTUALLY-- I CAME DOWN
HERE TO TELL YOU

20:13.280 --> 20:15.348
THAT I'M NOT GOING
TO BE HERE NEXT WEEK.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.016
I'M GOING AWAY
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.185
- A COUPLE OF DAYS.
- MM-HMM.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.953
ROSIE'S NOT GONNA BE HERE,
AND I THOUGHT

20:21.053 --> 20:23.756
- I'D HAVE MY MOTHER COME
AND HELP WITH MATT.
- WHAT IS THIS?

20:23.856 --> 20:27.260
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
YOU'RE GOING AWAY
FOR A FEW DAYS?

20:27.360 --> 20:30.463
IT'S FOR A WEEK ACTUALLY.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.170
WITH--

20:38.271 --> 20:41.274
WITH HIM?

20:43.376 --> 20:44.911
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

20:49.015 --> 20:51.017
TO ROME.

20:51.117 --> 20:54.487
ROME.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.724
WOW, ROME--
OF ALL THE CITIES.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.126
ROME.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.228
WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF REVENGE?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.731
NO, ROME IS COMPLETELY
COINCIDENTAL.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.966
IT WAS SOME DEAL
HE GOT WITH WORK
OR SOMETHING.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.136
NEXT TO THE PASSPORTS
THERE'S SOME BUSINESS CARDS

21:10.236 --> 21:12.705
OF OUR FAVORITE
RESTAURANTS IN ROME.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.876
MAYBE I CAN BOOK YOU TWO
INTO THE IL PALAZETTO, MAYBE?

21:16.976 --> 21:18.411
YOU KNOW, PAUL,
ALL YOU HAD--

21:18.511 --> 21:20.547
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET OUT OF HERE?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.587
I DON'T INTEND
TO FEEL GUILTY,
YOU KNOW.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.889
I'M NOT REALLY
INTERESTED IN WHAT
YOU FEEL, KATE.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.359
( scoffs )
YOU HAVE MADE THAT
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.861
JUST CLOSE THE DOOR
BEHIND YOU.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.879
( jazz continues playing )
