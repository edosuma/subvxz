WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:03.360
I was thinking
about a trip to London.

00:03.400 --> 00:04.680
I could meet
your London friends.

00:04.720 --> 00:07.240
Are you sure about
this Northgate business?

00:07.280 --> 00:09.200
You don't want to get yourself
laughed at.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.880
I'd like a ceremony

00:10.920 --> 00:12.720
- to lay the first stone.
- Of course.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.720
Can we not have one last kiss?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.560
God!

00:19.600 --> 00:21.160
I missed you.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.000
I have the deed box here,
with me, at Shibden Hall.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.400
This... This... Ugh!

00:26.440 --> 00:28.040
You have to be certain

00:28.080 --> 00:31.600
that this, here, with me,
is what you want.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.960
<i>103 Long Acre.</i>

00:54.000 --> 00:56.280
And tell whoever you deal with
to send a trusty person

00:56.320 --> 00:58.200
to collect my payments for
the repairs to the carriage.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.280
Here - Hawkins Hotel
in Dover Street,

01:01.320 --> 01:02.640
at one o'clock this afternoon.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.080
And then tell them
to send the carriage

01:05.120 --> 01:08.400
with a pair of good horses
and a steady driver

01:08.440 --> 01:09.840
at six o'clock tonight.
It's all in there.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.520
- 103 Long Acre.
- Pearce and Baxter.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.000
Ask the porter downstairs

01:16.040 --> 01:17.680
to give you a boy
to show you the way.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.760
What a relief it'll be
to get my own carriage back.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.800
- Hmm?
- Miss...

01:33.680 --> 01:36.000
You look ridiculous.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.640
Let's not be small-minded
with one another.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.840
Now, pour me some tea.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.680
<i>Pour your own fucking tea.</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:46.240
And we were getting on
so nicely in the high-flyer.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.840
You should never have claimed
powers you don't possess.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.760
Nothing...

01:50.800 --> 01:52.640
...would please me more

01:52.680 --> 01:53.920
than to introduce you

01:53.960 --> 01:56.680
to Lady Stuart de Rothesay
and Vere

01:56.720 --> 01:58.240
and any number of others,

01:58.280 --> 02:00.560
- but this isn't the time.
- When we first met...

02:00.600 --> 02:02.880
Well, when we became
reacquainted, you said,

02:02.920 --> 02:05.360
you <i>promised</i> me, that you would
introduce me to people.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.080
Yes, and I did.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.320
The Norcliffes.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.080
No, proper people.
London society.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.200
We're in town to find a master
for the new school,

02:15.240 --> 02:18.120
primarily, and to visit
the doctor and the dentist

02:18.160 --> 02:19.440
and to get our watches fixed.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.520
And, yes, some pleasure,
of course.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.960
But...

02:23.000 --> 02:25.600
...this isn't a time
for you to meet new people,

02:25.640 --> 02:27.120
not while
you still have anxieties

02:27.160 --> 02:28.640
about the division
of the estate.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.680
Oh! What's that got to do
with anything?

02:36.440 --> 02:38.680
You have a lot on your mind.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.240
And until it's resolved,

02:41.280 --> 02:44.000
you're here to relax,

02:44.040 --> 02:46.480
not to be stared at.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.440
- Stared at?
- I shouldn't like

02:48.480 --> 02:50.040
to see you overwhelmed.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.760
And believe me,
these people can overwhelm.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.320
But <i>you'll</i> go and see them.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.120
If they heard
I'd been in London

02:55.160 --> 02:56.360
and not visited them,

02:56.400 --> 03:00.440
then they'd be surprised,
certainly, and offended, even.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.440
And anyway, you have your...

03:02.480 --> 03:04.920
Mrs Plowes'...friend to see, so...

03:07.320 --> 03:09.800
The time will come.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.200
But this isn't it.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.200
I was trying to recall
when it was we last saw you,

03:48.240 --> 03:49.560
- Miss Lister.
- Oh...

03:49.600 --> 03:50.680
It was at
the Jardin des Plantes.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.280
You were there, Lady Cameron,
you remember.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.400
- How could I forget?
- Where were you, Mama?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.400
- I've no idea.
- No, I think you were with us.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.080
No, my darling,
I don't think I was.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.880
- I was there.
- Oh, it was you, Grandmama!

04:01.920 --> 04:03.720
- Mm.
- And, Charles,

04:03.760 --> 04:05.360
you've never seen
anything like it.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.240
It was as if we'd been
swallowed by the whale.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.560
We were sitting on chairs,
but inside the whale!

04:10.600 --> 04:13.360
Well, Miss Lister always had
a talent for knowing

04:13.400 --> 04:15.040
the best things to do and see.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.160
What was the favour,

04:16.200 --> 04:18.080
Miss Lister,
you mentioned earlier?

04:18.120 --> 04:19.400
Oh.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.720
So, when Miss Walker and I
were in Geneva last year,

04:22.760 --> 04:24.920
I ordered a scale model
of the Alps

04:24.960 --> 04:26.440
from Monsieur Gaudin.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.720
And it's finally due to arrive
in England any day now,

04:28.760 --> 04:31.480
but the problem is
they'll open it,

04:31.520 --> 04:33.400
at Customs House.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.880
And the anxiety is
they'll damage it.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.040
It's a huge thing -
it's 7ft square!

04:37.080 --> 04:39.200
Good Lord!

04:39.240 --> 04:40.280
Oh, it's wonderful!

04:40.320 --> 04:42.080
Whatever will you do with it?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.560
And Monsieur Gaudin emphasised

04:43.600 --> 04:46.320
how carefully these models
are packed for shipping,

04:46.360 --> 04:48.760
being so fragile.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.720
But apparently, if I can get
an order from the Treasury

04:51.760 --> 04:55.320
for it to be delivered
to Shibden unopened...

04:55.360 --> 04:56.480
Write down the details,

04:56.520 --> 04:57.920
send it to me first thing
in the morning.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.880
- I'll sort it out.
- Oh.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.960
What can I say?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.680
How disappointing, Miss Lister,
not to conquer Mont Blanc.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.320
Oh, I could've cried.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.800
But I will...

05:09.840 --> 05:11.960
<i>...we</i> will go back.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.280
How lucky,

05:13.320 --> 05:16.840
to find a travelling companion
as intrepid as you are!

05:26.000 --> 05:28.240
It's going to be quite a day
for us tomorrow.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.320
I'm devastated
you're in town only so briefly.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.160
You can't imagine
how bored I've been at Richmond

05:36.200 --> 05:38.240
with my aunt
during my confinement.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.440
Really?

05:40.560 --> 05:42.480
We quibble about money.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.000
Can you imagine?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.880
I didn't pay the gardener,
but I had use of the garden.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.840
I was giving birth!

05:50.000 --> 05:51.400
I was never even in the garden!

05:52.560 --> 05:54.320
Is she worried about money?

05:54.360 --> 05:56.040
Well, I suppose she must be.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.920
She's very fond of you.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.480
This is all I do now, Anne.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.320
Donald does the business
and I...

06:03.920 --> 06:05.280
...I drop babies.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.920
Children are a blessing.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.480
They're the cement
of any marriage...

06:13.520 --> 06:15.080
...surely.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.560
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.720
Neither did I.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.320
The carriages are ready.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.440
Thank you.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.600
We have two carriages outside!

06:26.640 --> 06:29.560
What're we...? Where're we...?
What're we doing?

06:31.160 --> 06:33.280
You're going to Lady Gordon
for coffee, Mother.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.640
Not me, I'm afraid.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.320
- I've got to work.
- Nor me.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.440
I have to get back to my...

06:38.480 --> 06:42.280
Miss Walker and I are visiting
the National School

06:42.320 --> 06:44.320
at Westminster
first thing in the morning.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.920
She's opening a school, locally.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.120
A good one.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.040
So we're trying to find
a suitable master for it.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.960
Miss Stuart was delighted

07:06.000 --> 07:07.080
with the wedding present
we sent

07:07.120 --> 07:08.200
from Howell and James's,
by the way.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.440
Oh, was she? Oh, good.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.040
What's the matter?

07:13.120 --> 07:14.880
Why aren't we moving?

07:14.920 --> 07:16.760
Perhaps there's been
an accident.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.120
Why did you talk so much?

07:18.160 --> 07:19.520
- Hmm?
- At the school.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.600
I couldn't get a word in edgeways.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.000
Mr Johnson'll think

07:23.040 --> 07:24.760
- I'm some kind of half-wit.
- Well, I...

07:24.800 --> 07:26.720
He didn't even look at me.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.400
He didn't even address me,
not once.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.320
- I thought you wanted me to...
- I wanted you to shut up.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.360
I'm fairly certain

07:37.400 --> 07:39.160
he'll consider
someone setting up a new school

07:39.200 --> 07:41.800
and taking the time and trouble
to visit other top schools

07:41.840 --> 07:45.280
in preparation for it
very far from being a half-wit.

07:48.520 --> 07:52.120
Listen,
I've been thinking.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.840
When we get back to Halifax,

07:53.880 --> 07:56.000
and I don't know
how you'll feel about this,

07:56.040 --> 07:57.360
but...

07:58.560 --> 08:01.080
...would you do me the honour
of laying the foundation stone

08:01.120 --> 08:02.560
for the casino?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.720
I imagine
just a small public gathering

08:04.760 --> 08:06.440
with a few well-chosen words.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.880
Something to dignify
the occasion.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.640
You mean make a speech? Me?

08:12.680 --> 08:14.920
Yes.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.640
Do you think I could do that?

08:16.680 --> 08:18.480
I'm certain you could.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.080
Huh.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.680
<i>When will
you reach Edinburgh?</i>

08:27.720 --> 08:29.680
Erm... Is it tomorrow night?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.360
And then the train!

08:31.400 --> 08:32.800
To Manchester.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.720
Hopefully, we should be
in Halifax

08:34.760 --> 08:36.000
by Saturday or Sunday.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.440
Poor Elizabeth!

08:38.480 --> 08:40.520
Yes, the timing
is far from perfect,

08:40.560 --> 08:42.440
but Elizabeth's little sister

08:42.480 --> 08:45.600
and Miss Lister must have
their holiday in London!

08:45.640 --> 08:48.800
Yet we're the ones
that are being difficult.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.400
Must you go at all?

08:51.440 --> 08:53.200
Sadly, Mother, yes.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.880
The archaic nature of the deeds

08:54.920 --> 08:57.320
mean Elizabeth and I
must sign in person.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.160
If we sign at all.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.560
May I take little John, ma'am?

09:03.600 --> 09:05.680
Yes, of course, Dorothy.
Thank you.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.400
Mama...

09:12.440 --> 09:14.800
You mustn't fret, Elizabeth.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.320
Little John and the girls
will be perfectly happy here,

09:18.360 --> 09:19.440
with me and Dorothy.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.960
I'd better, erm...

09:21.000 --> 09:23.440
I've just got a few bits
and pieces

09:23.480 --> 09:25.560
- to sort upstairs.
- Of course, my dear.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.240
You mustn't let her fret.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.360
Well, it's not that.
She's, erm...

09:34.480 --> 09:36.600
Well, she's worried
about her sister.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.160
So am I.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.080
Is she...

09:40.120 --> 09:41.720
...struggling again?

09:41.760 --> 09:43.720
Oh, who knows?

09:43.760 --> 09:46.320
She may be,
but it's not that exactly.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.640
It's more an anxiety
about this...

09:49.680 --> 09:51.760
...unnatural hold

09:51.800 --> 09:55.440
that Miss Lister
seems to have over her.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.160
Unnatural?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.120
Yes, we, er, we think so.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.760
As in?

10:03.520 --> 10:09.680
You remember there was a case
years ago in Edinburgh.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.000
Two women...

10:12.040 --> 10:13.840
No!

10:13.880 --> 10:15.160
Mm.

10:15.200 --> 10:19.200
Well, anyway,
that's the anxiety.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.760
And with Ann being
so vulnerable and biddable

10:21.800 --> 10:24.480
and under the spell
of the woman,

10:24.520 --> 10:26.320
Lord alone knows
where it might end.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.760
And the shocking thing is

10:29.800 --> 10:32.600
Miss Lister can hide
in plain sight.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.800
Who would ever suspect a woman

10:36.840 --> 10:38.840
of being a fortune hunter and...

10:41.880 --> 10:43.040
...a predator?

10:45.720 --> 10:47.440
The lawyers
clearly haven't a clue.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.520
It's evil.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.120
I've worked out that if we did
want to spend the winter

11:02.160 --> 11:04.200
in a rented house
in Leamington,

11:04.240 --> 11:06.360
our weekly expenses
would amount

11:06.400 --> 11:09.520
to 15 pounds and 11 shillings exactly.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.120
Mm.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.840
Well, something to think about.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.560
Perhaps for the future.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.200
I can't go on like this,
you do know that.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.840
What?

11:22.880 --> 11:24.400
Me paying for everything.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.680
Well, that's...

11:29.720 --> 11:32.560
Well, when we left Shibden,

11:32.600 --> 11:34.520
we did agree that
that's what...

11:35.520 --> 11:37.920
...what with me laying out
so much capital

11:37.960 --> 11:40.480
for the casino
and for the new pit

11:40.520 --> 11:41.960
and the refurbishments
at Shibden,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.640
- and one thing and another...
- £5 here, £200 there.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.240
It starts to add up.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.280
The London trip was, primarily,
for you,

11:53.320 --> 11:55.720
for you to find a schoolmaster,

11:55.760 --> 11:58.240
to see the dentist,
to see Sir Benjamin,

11:58.280 --> 11:59.440
to see Mrs Plowes,

11:59.480 --> 12:01.360
to see Westminster Abbey
and the Houses of Parliament.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.560
Hmm? To get away.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.640
No, it wasn't.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.520
It was for you
to see <i>your</i> friends.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.600
Oh, so none of
those other things happened.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.120
- I won't be sifted.
- Sifted?

12:12.160 --> 12:13.240
- For money.
- Sifted?

12:13.280 --> 12:15.720
We said our arrangement
would be as good as a marriage.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.120
As far as it could be, yes.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.960
You should've taken me
to meet your friends.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.720
- As I explained...
- I am your wife!

12:20.760 --> 12:23.280
When it's convenient,
when you need money...

12:23.320 --> 12:24.760
...in bed.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.200
But when it comes

12:26.240 --> 12:28.000
to your aristocratic people,
I'm an inconvenience.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.040
As I say, one day...

12:30.080 --> 12:31.120
And then there's Mrs Lawton.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.080
Mrs Lawton?

12:34.120 --> 12:35.640
I know there was more to it,

12:35.680 --> 12:38.120
that night when you came back
from Lawton Hall.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.120
The damage is done.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.120
I've seen you
in your true colours.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.360
My tr...?

12:47.480 --> 12:49.800
I got you an appointment
with the King's surgeon.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.360
Not only
because he's the King's surgeon

12:52.400 --> 12:53.440
but because he's also

12:53.480 --> 12:55.120
the leading expert
in joint pain,

12:55.160 --> 12:56.920
which I bothered to find out
for you!

12:56.960 --> 13:01.440
Those are <i>my</i> true colours.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.200
I think you're anxious
about getting back

13:26.240 --> 13:28.560
to Halifax
because of the Sutherlands.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.760
I think that's what
all of this is about.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.920
The amount of money

13:31.960 --> 13:33.720
you're spending these days
terrifies me.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.280
You're the one person
who's shown any faith

13:35.320 --> 13:36.320
in my Northgate scheme.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.680
Yes, and I hope it succeeds,
but what if it doesn't?

13:38.720 --> 13:41.040
I'm frightened
that you'll ruin yourself

13:41.080 --> 13:42.160
and then me.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.200
How could I ruin you?

13:43.240 --> 13:44.440
I'm borrowing all of
the big money elsewhere.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.360
Yes, but who are you
counting on to bail you out

13:46.400 --> 13:48.080
if you can't maintain
your repayments?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.320
No, I would never do that
to you.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.880
Do you think I could bear
to see you

13:51.920 --> 13:52.920
in a debtors' prison?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.920
If the worst came to the worst,
which it won't,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.600
I would sell Shibden.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.200
I could live anywhere.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.640
I could live under a stone
if I had to.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.280
And as for a debtors' prison...

14:08.560 --> 14:10.360
Well, they'd have to catch me first.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.160
No.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.320
I'm sorry,
I can't do this any more.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.000
And I'm still not convinced that...

14:29.800 --> 14:32.120
...what we do
is right.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.160
Well...

14:42.960 --> 14:44.560
You know
what I think about that.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.000
I've explained it
often enough.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.480
I think the sooner we part,
the better.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.920
Well, then.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.840
You do know that
my first and greatest wish

15:21.880 --> 15:23.920
has always been
for your happiness.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.080
And if I can't make you happy, then...

15:30.040 --> 15:31.040
...I only hope

15:31.080 --> 15:32.840
that someone else
might succeed better.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.480
There's a church here
with a monument

16:22.520 --> 16:24.240
to a child that died.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.120
I once saw it years ago
when I was travelling

16:27.160 --> 16:28.440
with Mrs Lawton.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.520
I always thought,

16:29.560 --> 16:32.080
if I passed by here again,
I'd like to see it again.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.520
Would you mind?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.840
No, of course not.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.600
"She was in form and intellect
most exquisite."

17:20.840 --> 17:22.400
"The unfortunate parents

17:22.440 --> 17:25.000
"ventured their all
on this frail bark,

17:25.040 --> 17:27.160
"and the wreck was total."

17:28.560 --> 17:29.640
Five years old.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.200
Anne, what's the matter?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.680
I just...

17:39.040 --> 17:41.320
I don't know.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.520
It was the same
last time I came here.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.960
I just...

17:54.280 --> 17:57.080
"In form and intellect
most exquisite."

18:03.240 --> 18:04.560
And she died.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.280
Three weeks - 21 days -
before I was born.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.920
Isn't that curious?

18:16.160 --> 18:18.240
And I can't help imagining if...

18:19.680 --> 18:22.880
What if...that was me?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.160
What if I'm her?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.000
What do you mean?

18:34.560 --> 18:35.960
Why <i>am</i> I me?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.920
I was born into
a fairly useless family.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.600
No, not the Listers.
The Listers aren't useless.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.960
Just my particular
little squad of them.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.640
Not Aunt Anne, not Uncle James.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.240
Just...

18:51.280 --> 18:53.160
My father.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.200
My mother.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.560
And poor Marian.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.800
So why do I have
such refined tastes

19:02.840 --> 19:05.240
and aspirations and...?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.520
Where does that come from?

19:10.480 --> 19:11.760
Why is it in my bones

19:11.800 --> 19:14.000
to want to spend time
with people

19:14.040 --> 19:16.440
who are so much better
than myself?

19:22.280 --> 19:23.920
What if, in another life...

19:29.160 --> 19:30.320
...that was me?

19:32.320 --> 19:34.160
I...

19:34.200 --> 19:36.200
I don't think
that's how things work.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.040
No, yes, it can.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.480
Reincarnation.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.520
Yes, but that doesn't really... That...

19:42.560 --> 19:44.440
So why does it have
this effect on me?

19:46.320 --> 19:48.920
I'm a scientist, a logician.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.920
I don't engage
in fanciful nonsense.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.000
It's either that or...

20:07.840 --> 20:10.360
What if this is the child
that I'll never have?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.040
The child
that I can never give you.

20:24.240 --> 20:29.040
"In form and intellect
most exquisite."

20:33.640 --> 20:35.120
The perfect child...

20:39.360 --> 20:41.560
...who can never breathe.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.840
May never have life.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.680
I don't know.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.480
Oh.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.560
Oh, I'm ridiculous.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.680
No, you're not.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.720
We very nearly bought
a sketch by Turner.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.640
<i>The</i> Turner.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.760
A tiny little thing,
done before he was famous.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.080
We were both quite taken by it.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.680
But they were asking
four guineas,

21:44.720 --> 21:46.800
which was just that bit more
than either of us were willing

21:46.840 --> 21:48.640
- to pay.
- I've never liked Turner.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.240
Oh, really?

21:50.280 --> 21:52.400
And he speaks so highly of you.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.640
Does he?

21:54.680 --> 21:56.880
My sister
and Captain Sutherland

21:56.920 --> 21:58.760
and little Sackville
have arrived at Cliffe Hill.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.400
My aunt's expecting me there
in the morning.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.240
She wants me to stay
until a week on Saturday.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.640
- When? He's never met me.
- Will you go?

22:05.680 --> 22:07.160
I'd like to see Elizabeth.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.920
Well, then.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.360
And will you still lay
the foundation stone for me?

22:12.400 --> 22:13.840
Of course.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.880
How did...? When has Turner
ever said anything about me?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.360
What foundation stone?

22:20.400 --> 22:22.120
Oh, it's for the casino.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.520
Just a small ceremony.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.400
I don't think I could

22:26.440 --> 22:28.760
comfortably get down to Halifax
any more.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.720
No, Aunt,
and I wouldn't expect you to.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.560
But if anyone else...

22:32.600 --> 22:36.240
...felt able to come
and support me - us -

22:36.280 --> 22:39.440
you'd be very welcome.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.120
Mm.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.480
I don't think
we've any other news.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.920
Have we any other news, Jeremy?

22:44.960 --> 22:46.120
No.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.800
Oh, Dr Jubb came
last Wednesday.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.880
Or was it Tuesday?

22:49.920 --> 22:52.560
I don't think
I've seen anyone else.

23:12.160 --> 23:16.040
The...
The room's sp-spinning.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.400
I imagine so.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.360
I'm going to...

23:22.400 --> 23:24.000
I'm going to be s-sick.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.200
<i>There is danger
in the first thought</i>

23:34.240 --> 23:37.560
<i>that it is possible
for us to part.</i>

23:37.600 --> 23:40.360
<i>She is queer
and little-minded...</i>

23:40.400 --> 23:41.400
Oof!

23:41.440 --> 23:43.280
<i>...and I fear
for her intellect.</i>

23:43.320 --> 23:46.200
<i>I see I must make the best
of it for the moment</i>

23:46.240 --> 23:47.600
<i>and then...</i>

23:47.640 --> 23:49.880
...perhaps I shall be at large again.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.360
So, Ann...

24:22.560 --> 24:23.600
Tell me.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.440
What are the arrangements?

24:29.080 --> 24:30.280
What arrangements?

24:30.320 --> 24:32.280
For signing
the surrender of the deeds.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.800
Oh. Erm...

24:34.840 --> 24:37.000
Well, Mr Gray,

24:37.040 --> 24:40.040
or his assistant or...

24:40.080 --> 24:42.040
...someone, erm,

24:42.080 --> 24:44.400
Is going to come over
from York on Friday,

24:44.440 --> 24:45.760
I think,

24:45.800 --> 24:46.960
for us all to sign...

24:48.200 --> 24:50.560
...whatever needs signing.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.880
As far as I understand it,
that's...

24:54.040 --> 24:55.240
Th-That's it.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.080
As far as you understand it?

25:01.120 --> 25:03.680
Yes, that...
Yes, that's what's happening.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.280
I expected Miss Lister
to be with you.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.160
I'm sure
she'll come around this week,

25:10.200 --> 25:11.840
when she has
a spare five minutes,

25:11.880 --> 25:13.960
<i>if</i> she has five minutes.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.400
Can we be frank, Ann?

25:16.440 --> 25:18.440
Elizabeth and I are concerned.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.960
Now, you are perfectly entitled
to request

25:21.000 --> 25:22.400
the division of the property.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.400
No, no, no, no, no.
You-you agreed.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.720
You agreed the terms
in your last letter.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.640
You're here to sign.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.480
Any more tiresome discussion
about it is over.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.440
Elizabeth and I
are concerned

25:33.480 --> 25:35.440
that you have been coerced
by someone.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.640
- And if that's the case...
- Coerced?

25:37.680 --> 25:41.440
<i>If</i> that is the case,
then we have a duty,

25:41.480 --> 25:44.240
a responsibility
to protect you.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.440
I'm 32 years old.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.000
I am in excellent health,

25:49.040 --> 25:50.440
better than I've been
for a long time.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.520
I don't...
I don't need protecting.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.760
I think you look pale.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.280
Perhaps...

25:59.320 --> 26:02.040
Perhaps you need protecting
from yourself.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.080
Hmm?

26:04.120 --> 26:06.080
It wouldn't be the first time.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.120
Don't touch me.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.120
Now, I...

26:10.160 --> 26:12.120
I was more than a little alarmed

26:12.160 --> 26:14.280
to discover in your last letter

26:14.320 --> 26:17.440
that for the last
however many months

26:17.480 --> 26:19.920
the deeds to the entire estate
have been kept at Shibden Hall.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.480
Alarmed? Why?

26:21.520 --> 26:22.520
Where anyone might see them.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.720
Well, that's where I live.
Where else would I keep them?

26:24.760 --> 26:26.840
They should've been left
in the vault at the bank,

26:26.880 --> 26:28.040
where I put them,

26:28.080 --> 26:29.400
where they were safe.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.560
I needed to consult them

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
to draw up the proposals
for the division.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.160
They're perfectly safe
at Shibden.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.040
They're locked
in a block tin box

26:37.080 --> 26:38.840
in the upper kitchen chamber.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.520
Miss Lister's very particular
about security.

26:41.560 --> 26:45.400
Oh, yes,
I'm sure she is.

26:47.840 --> 26:52.080
We know you don't write
your own letters.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.480
Too precise.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.400
Too litigious.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.280
Too competent.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.320
Is it not the truth...

27:06.400 --> 27:09.120
...that Miss Lister
is behind this whole request

27:09.160 --> 27:10.520
- for the division?
- No.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.920
I think she is.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.200
I think she has orchestrated
the whole thing.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.200
For whatever purpose,
I can't imagine.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.920
Or maybe I can.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.360
Only too vividly.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.240
But Elizabeth and I
have a duty...

27:24.280 --> 27:26.320
I want my half
of my father's estate.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.160
You've had Elizabeth's half,

27:29.200 --> 27:30.720
you'll not keep mine from me
any longer.

27:30.760 --> 27:37.080
Does Jonathan Gray understand
the exact nature of this...

27:38.560 --> 27:41.520
...hold Miss Lister
has over you?

27:41.560 --> 27:42.600
Wh...

27:43.880 --> 27:45.120
Wh-What hold?

27:45.160 --> 27:48.280
Elizabeth is
just as concerned as I am.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.800
About the nature of...

27:52.240 --> 27:54.400
...your relationship
with Miss Lister.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.920
Miss Lister is irrelevant.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.400
I might not stay
much longer at Shibden Hall.

28:08.920 --> 28:13.080
But I do want my moiety
of my father's estate.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.640
I want to see the deeds
and the rent books!

28:26.560 --> 28:27.680
Oh, Argus.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.280
There's a note, ma'am.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.320
From Cliffe Hill.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.480
The servant brought it.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.440
<i>My dearest Anne,</i>

28:44.480 --> 28:47.280
<i>Captain Sutherland started
an argument about the deeds</i>

28:47.320 --> 28:48.680
<i>as soon as he decently could.</i>

28:48.720 --> 28:50.440
<i>He demanded to see
the rent books,</i>

28:50.480 --> 28:51.480
<i>and so I refused.</i>

28:51.520 --> 28:53.480
<i>He has gone off to York
in a great flurry,</i>

28:53.520 --> 28:56.040
<i>hoping to see Mr Gray
first thing in the morning.</i>

28:56.080 --> 28:58.400
<i>It is far from clear
whether he intends to sign</i>

28:58.440 --> 28:59.760
<i>for the division or not.</i>

28:59.800 --> 29:01.280
<i>I shall stay here
with Elizabeth,</i>

29:01.320 --> 29:03.160
<i>whose head he seems
to have turned,</i>

29:03.200 --> 29:04.760
<i>but if you were
to make arrangements</i>

29:04.800 --> 29:07.880
<i>for us to go to York ourselves
later tomorrow to see Mr Gray,</i>

29:07.920 --> 29:10.680
<i>if - on Captain Sutherland's
return - we deem it necessary,</i>

29:10.720 --> 29:12.080
<i>I would be grateful.</i>

29:12.120 --> 29:13.720
<i>Please come over when you can.</i>

29:13.760 --> 29:15.480
<i>I am your own, AW.</i>

30:10.600 --> 30:12.080
There's been no communication

30:12.120 --> 30:14.480
from the servants' registry
in York

30:14.520 --> 30:16.680
about a replacement
for Matthew.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.200
I may have to go over to York
later today -

30:19.240 --> 30:20.640
I'll give Mr Thomas a jolt.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.440
I'm not happy about...

30:31.840 --> 30:33.240
I'm not happy.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.600
What's the matter?

30:46.840 --> 30:50.760
I'm thinking I'd like to move
back to Market Weighton.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.480
And take Father with me.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.920
Post, ma'am,
and a message from Mrs Bagnall.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.200
There's a massive parcel
for you

30:59.240 --> 31:01.040
down at t'sorting office,
7ft by 7ft big,

31:01.080 --> 31:02.800
and she says it's been there
since Monday

31:02.840 --> 31:04.440
and it's in t'way
and can you fetch it?

31:04.480 --> 31:05.880
Oh! It's my model of the Alps!

31:07.360 --> 31:08.840
Yes, of course you can.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.240
Take the cart.
Take your brother.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.040
Now! Go. Go on.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.880
Why move back
to Market Weighton?

31:22.920 --> 31:24.480
Just...

31:26.800 --> 31:29.400
I find the management
of the household finances

31:29.440 --> 31:32.480
too much for me,
and no-one listens to me,

31:32.520 --> 31:34.200
and you don't, and I just....

31:34.240 --> 31:37.160
I don't feel there's anything
much for me here any more.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.440
What about...

31:41.640 --> 31:42.920
...Mr Abbott?

31:44.640 --> 31:45.960
That's all off.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.960
Is it? When?

31:50.760 --> 31:51.840
Some time ago.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.240
Well....

32:01.280 --> 32:03.000
...I'd...miss you.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.440
Miss Walker would miss you.
Aunt Anne would miss you.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.160
And I <i>do</i> listen to you.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.960
And if the household finances
are a burden,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.200
then let me help you with them.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.440
Hmm?

32:21.480 --> 32:22.640
Oh, good Lord.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.000
Anne?

32:28.040 --> 32:30.120
It's... Tib.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.680
Her mother's had a stroke.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.320
Oh...

32:47.200 --> 32:51.560
First - and as I have explained
to Miss Walker – I've been

32:51.600 --> 32:53.800
as keen as her to find a time
where my wife and I

32:53.840 --> 32:56.160
could get down here
to settle the matter,

32:56.200 --> 32:58.800
not least so that I can
make provision in my own will

32:58.840 --> 33:00.640
for my children.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.040
But it is now utterly apparent
that it would be

33:03.080 --> 33:05.080
grossly irresponsible
to sign for the division.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.920
Why?

33:06.960 --> 33:09.840
Sir, my wife believes,

33:09.880 --> 33:11.560
as I do...

33:12.560 --> 33:14.520
...that her sister
is being manipulated

33:14.560 --> 33:17.240
into making choices
that are neither hers

33:17.280 --> 33:20.600
- nor in her best interests.
- How?

33:20.640 --> 33:26.120
My sister-in-law
has, in the past, had...

33:27.120 --> 33:28.800
...problems.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.240
She has a...

33:30.280 --> 33:32.000
...weakness of mind

33:32.040 --> 33:35.040
that any knowing
or unscrupulous person

33:35.080 --> 33:36.320
might take advantage of.

33:36.360 --> 33:40.960
And that is precisely what
we believe has been happening.

33:42.200 --> 33:46.120
Are you suggesting
that <i>I</i> have manipulated her?

33:46.160 --> 33:47.920
No!

33:47.960 --> 33:50.640
No, no, certainly not!
Why would you?

33:57.720 --> 34:01.400
Do you know Miss Lister?
Anne Lister.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.600
I've known Miss Lister
for some years.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.680
It is a...

34:05.720 --> 34:08.880
...a difficult accusation
to make against a lady.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.160
You'll have to forgive
my indelicacy,

34:12.200 --> 34:16.520
but I feel I must express what
plagues my thoughts, otherwise

34:16.560 --> 34:17.760
I would never forgive myself

34:17.800 --> 34:19.960
if anything were to happen
to Miss Walker.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.160
We believe...

34:24.200 --> 34:27.200
...Miss Lister has...

34:27.240 --> 34:29.120
...an unnatural hold over her

34:29.160 --> 34:30.440
and her ultimate aim

34:30.480 --> 34:33.480
is to have what money
she can from her.

34:37.040 --> 34:41.040
Your sister-in-law underwent
a course of treatment

34:41.080 --> 34:43.840
here in York in the earlier
part of last year

34:43.880 --> 34:47.120
with a Dr Belcombe,
who, you may know,

34:47.160 --> 34:50.040
is highly regarded
in his field.

34:51.200 --> 34:55.600
And I know that he's been
pleased with her progress

34:55.640 --> 34:59.440
and has been clear -
we've spoken, and recently -

34:59.480 --> 35:02.040
that in his opinion,

35:02.080 --> 35:04.320
Miss Walker is
in a perfectly fit

35:04.360 --> 35:06.360
and healthy state of mind
to make a will.

35:07.960 --> 35:12.320
And so, on this matter over
the division of the estate,

35:12.360 --> 35:14.480
I have no anxieties whatsoever.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.040
Your concern
for your sister-in-law

35:17.080 --> 35:19.680
is of course laudable,
but legally

35:19.720 --> 35:23.360
there are no grounds
on which to deny her

35:23.400 --> 35:25.800
a recognised division
of an estate

35:25.840 --> 35:27.760
that is already half hers.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.440
And as for Miss Lister...

35:33.640 --> 35:36.920
...I've never seen her be
anything other than supportive

35:36.960 --> 35:39.000
and kind to Miss Walker.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.800
And what you call
"unnatural"...

35:41.920 --> 35:43.760
Well, yes, er,

35:43.800 --> 35:46.080
Miss Lister is
formidably well informed

35:46.120 --> 35:47.760
and she can't always hide it.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.920
And I know a display
of too much intellect

35:50.960 --> 35:52.800
is discouraged
amongst the ladies,

35:52.840 --> 35:55.120
but, really,

35:55.160 --> 35:59.120
Miss Walker is lucky to count
Miss Lister among her friends.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.480
I don't think you quite grasp

36:02.520 --> 36:05.680
what I'm rather...ineptly
trying to say.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.920
You may know -
it was a scandal at the time -

36:10.960 --> 36:13.520
there was a case in Edinburgh
some years ago

36:13.560 --> 36:17.160
brought against two women. Schoolteachers.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.240
We believe, my wife and I...

36:25.880 --> 36:27.440
...that Miss Lister has...

36:29.800 --> 36:33.320
...debauched Miss Walker.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.000
The case you refer to
wasn't against the two women.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.000
It was against the lady

36:53.040 --> 36:56.480
who accused them openly
of sexual misconduct.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.560
They sued her

36:59.600 --> 37:02.200
for attempting to destroy
their reputations

37:02.240 --> 37:04.680
and the reputation
of their school.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.360
They won.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.400
One of the presiding
magistrates said

37:10.440 --> 37:13.560
of the accusations
the lady made against them,

37:13.600 --> 37:17.600
"The crime here alleged
does not exist."

37:19.040 --> 37:22.080
Miss Lister may not be
the marrying kind,

37:22.120 --> 37:25.400
but if you were to suggest
anything beyond that,

37:25.440 --> 37:29.360
you'd face the same problem
as the Scottish lady,

37:29.400 --> 37:32.920
because, even if
such a thing <i>were</i> possible

37:32.960 --> 37:36.760
between two highly respectable
Christian Englishwomen,

37:36.800 --> 37:38.280
the fact would remain

37:38.320 --> 37:40.760
that it's not illegal.

37:43.160 --> 37:48.120
The lady in Scotland who made
the accusations appealed,

37:48.160 --> 37:51.120
and it went all the way
up to the House of Lords,

37:51.160 --> 37:54.080
who ordered her
to pay the two women

37:54.120 --> 37:56.760
whose lives she had destroyed
with her tittle-tattle

37:56.800 --> 38:01.240
£10,000 costs and compensation.

38:08.960 --> 38:12.640
The intention is for my
assistant, Mr Shepley Watson,

38:12.680 --> 38:15.720
to come over to you in Halifax
on Friday afternoon

38:15.760 --> 38:18.360
with the documents
to be signed by yourself,

38:18.400 --> 38:20.520
Mrs Sutherland and Miss Walker.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.800
Will that be convenient?

38:25.240 --> 38:26.680
Yes, if...

38:28.160 --> 38:29.560
Yes. If... Yes.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.560
I can come myself, too,

38:31.600 --> 38:33.720
- if it helps matters.
- No.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.000
No, that, er....

38:36.640 --> 38:38.280
That won't be...

38:49.240 --> 38:51.160
Thank God you're here!
What's happened?

38:51.200 --> 38:52.840
I brought your pony
to give it some exercise

38:52.880 --> 38:54.200
and had a sad fight
with the animal

38:54.240 --> 38:55.600
nearly all the way here.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.480
Oh!

38:57.520 --> 38:59.360
Are we going to York?

38:59.400 --> 39:02.280
Oh, well, I don't...
I don't know.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.160
Mrs Norcliffe had a stroke.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.360
- When?
- Letter from Tib this morning.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.400
- Yesterday, apparently.
- I'm sorry.

39:11.560 --> 39:12.760
So, if we <i>were</i>

39:12.800 --> 39:14.680
- going to York, I thought...
- The thing is,

39:14.720 --> 39:16.040
Captain Sutherland
was back here by lunchtime

39:16.080 --> 39:17.680
and he seemed
thoroughly appeased.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.040
Did he indeed?

39:20.080 --> 39:23.360
He apologised to me, said
it was all Elizabeth's fault.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.400
How?

39:24.440 --> 39:28.160
Well, apparently, it was her
who wanted the rent books.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.880
It wasn't. He's lying.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.800
So I don't know
what your Mr Gray said to him,

39:31.840 --> 39:33.120
but something is afoot.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.160
Gray won't have said anything
against you. You're his client.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.320
His very wealthy client.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.800
Well, men collude,
especially when they think

39:40.840 --> 39:43.080
they're dealing with an...
invalid like me.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.440
You are <i>not</i> an invalid!

39:50.880 --> 39:52.520
You need to write to Gray

39:52.560 --> 39:55.840
and ascertain that everything's
still on course for Friday

39:55.880 --> 39:58.520
and in the meantime
cheerfully assume that it is.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.960
Why is he suddenly
blaming your sister?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.960
- Because...
- Because he wants you and her

40:05.000 --> 40:07.280
at odds with one another.
And why has he got

40:07.320 --> 40:08.880
a bee in his bonnet
about the rent books?

40:10.040 --> 40:11.080
Because...

40:12.080 --> 40:13.880
...he's cross that I've had
the deeds with me

40:13.920 --> 40:16.360
all these months
at Shibden Hall.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.000
Cross? Why? It's...
It's where you live.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.840
"Where anyone might see them."

40:24.280 --> 40:26.000
Oh.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.360
Meaning me?

40:27.400 --> 40:28.640
Because I'm so desperate

40:28.680 --> 40:30.520
to plunder your coffers, obviously.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.960
- Anne!
- Don't worry.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.120
My weapon of choice
comes in a velvet glove.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.320
Anne! Anne!

40:39.320 --> 40:41.960
Apparently, Mr Gray said
the deeds should have been

40:42.000 --> 40:44.120
left with an indifferent person
such as Mr Parker

40:44.160 --> 40:45.560
until the division was settled.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.280
Did he?

40:48.920 --> 40:50.280
Well then, show willing.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.000
Let's go into Halifax
this afternoon

40:53.040 --> 40:55.440
and give them to Parker
for safekeeping until it is.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.080
Then Captain Sutherland

40:57.120 --> 40:59.560
will have nothing to
find fault with.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.080
If it's still what you want.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.240
The division.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.880
Of course it is.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.520
And to change our wills?

41:07.560 --> 41:08.800
And all of it?

41:13.320 --> 41:15.680
I want to get
the division settled first.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.040
I want the division,
come what may.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.560
What comes after that...

41:20.960 --> 41:23.920
Well, let's just get this
dealt with first. Hmm?

41:29.600 --> 41:31.320
Fire!

41:31.360 --> 41:33.480
Mrs Sutherland.
Good Lord, how are you?

41:33.520 --> 41:34.800
- Anne's here.
- Miss Lister.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.360
Captain Sutherland!

41:36.400 --> 41:37.680
No, don't get up.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.320
No Miss Walker?

41:40.360 --> 41:42.280
She's upstairs.
She's having a lie down.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.000
Oh, Adney's pony threw me.
Or did I throw him?

41:45.040 --> 41:46.720
Her. I can't remember.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.400
Her.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.680
And this must be Sackville!

41:49.720 --> 41:51.640
What an elusive fellow!

41:53.040 --> 41:54.200
Yes. Good tactics.

41:54.240 --> 41:57.120
I can see you'd make
an excellent soldier.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.200
I can't stay long.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.520
I shouldn't even be here,
I've got so much on hand,

42:00.560 --> 42:02.520
but I'd have been sad
not to see you all

42:02.560 --> 42:04.720
since you travelled
all this way.

42:04.760 --> 42:05.960
Miss Walker's laying

42:06.000 --> 42:07.800
my foundation stone for me
on Saturday,

42:07.840 --> 42:09.800
I'm building a hotel
with an assembly room.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.040
Did she tell you?

42:12.080 --> 42:14.400
You should come and support us,
since you're here.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.120
Just a little ceremony.

42:16.160 --> 42:20.200
Just a few short speeches,
just for the town.

42:20.240 --> 42:21.400
Y-y...

42:21.440 --> 42:23.320
We'd be delighted.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.600
Perfect! And then why don't
you come to us for tea

42:25.640 --> 42:27.400
in the afternoon?
Adney can show you

42:27.440 --> 42:29.560
our neat little upstairs wing,
Mrs Sutherland,

42:29.600 --> 42:32.360
where we've been so happily
and cosily ensconced.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.280
And doesn't your sister
look well, Mrs Sutherland?

42:36.320 --> 42:38.120
Yes. Um...

42:41.360 --> 42:43.640
Yes. She...

42:43.680 --> 42:44.960
She does.

42:49.840 --> 42:53.440
Good Lord.
What has he done to Elizabeth?

42:53.480 --> 42:56.640
I talked at 19 knots and barely
prised a squeak from her.

42:56.680 --> 42:59.600
She daren't speak
for fear of contradicting him.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.360
And when he went into York

43:01.400 --> 43:05.200
all she talked about was
the children, and all so inane.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.440
Sorry if I'm a bit flat.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.200
I have poor Mrs Norcliffe
on my mind.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.560
She was always so kind to me
when I was younger.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.840
Well, you must go over.

43:18.880 --> 43:22.240
No, no, I'll stay here
till this is dealt with,

43:22.280 --> 43:25.080
and then...then I may go.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.800
I don't trust Parker.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.880
My advice is given
in good faith -

43:38.920 --> 43:41.560
whether it's accepted or not
is for the recipient to decide.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.640
There's Mr Harper
downstairs, ma'am,

44:08.680 --> 44:11.520
and a Mr Shepley Watson?

44:11.560 --> 44:14.600
He says he's from
Mr Gray's office. In York.

44:16.840 --> 44:18.720
Imagine our surprise,
Miss Lister,

44:18.760 --> 44:21.240
when Mr Watson and I
got chatting in the high flyer

44:21.280 --> 44:23.720
and realised we were heading
not just for Halifax

44:23.760 --> 44:24.880
but for Shibden Hall.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.520
Are you travelling back
to York tonight, Mr Watson?

44:27.560 --> 44:29.600
By the time
I've been over to Lightcliffe

44:29.640 --> 44:31.720
and got Captain and
Mrs Sutherland's signatures,

44:31.760 --> 44:33.680
I imagine I'd be as well
spending the night in Halifax.

44:33.720 --> 44:36.480
Well, then, I recommend
the White Swan Inn

44:36.520 --> 44:40.120
on Crown Street. Were you to
be here in a few months,

44:40.160 --> 44:42.840
I should recommend
the new Northgate Hotel.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.400
Thank you.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.960
On the subject of
accommodation, Miss Lister,

44:47.000 --> 44:48.400
my landscaper, Mr Samuel Gray,

44:48.440 --> 44:50.480
will arrive
during the afternoon tomorrow.

44:50.520 --> 44:51.960
Like Mr Nelson and Mr Husband,

44:52.000 --> 44:53.960
he'll stay for
the duration of the build,

44:54.000 --> 44:55.680
and he'll need somewhere
to live too.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.440
We can put him up here
for a few nights.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.440
Will he be all right sleeping
with my footman

44:59.480 --> 45:00.600
- in his quarters?
- Oh, yes.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.920
Until we can find something
more permanent for him.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.880
So...that's that.

45:04.920 --> 45:08.000
And you mentioned you might be
able to spare a servant,

45:08.040 --> 45:10.000
Miss Lister, to guide me
over to Cliffe Hill?

45:10.040 --> 45:11.080
Of course, Mr Watson!

45:12.200 --> 45:13.720
And I must get
back down to Halifax,

45:13.760 --> 45:15.560
catch up with Mr Nelson
before tomorrow.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.920
I might see you later on
at the Swan, then, Mr Watson.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.160
I'm staying there myself.

45:19.200 --> 45:20.680
And then the big day tomorrow!

45:20.720 --> 45:23.040
Is your speech ready,
Miss Walker?

45:23.080 --> 45:24.240
Yes. I think so.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.920
I almost have it by heart.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.600
Anne.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.080
Anne?

45:56.120 --> 45:57.280
Marian.

45:57.320 --> 45:59.160
You look splendid.

46:03.560 --> 46:04.840
I'm not coming.

46:04.880 --> 46:07.000
Why?

46:07.040 --> 46:08.920
I did want to, but...

46:11.160 --> 46:13.880
...what if the crowd
isn't very nice?

46:13.920 --> 46:18.160
What if they make comments
or throw things?

46:20.880 --> 46:22.600
Why would they want to do that?

46:25.040 --> 46:27.520
I wasn't completely honest
with you.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.120
About Mr Abbott.

46:32.520 --> 46:33.760
Are you still seeing him?

46:33.800 --> 46:36.000
No. No.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.400
Not that.

46:43.720 --> 46:47.040
He called a halt to things
between us because, well...

46:48.880 --> 46:50.920
..he hadn't seen it
at the time, but...

46:52.280 --> 46:54.280
...someone taunted him with

46:54.320 --> 46:57.520
that silly marriage
announcement in the paper.

46:57.560 --> 47:00.800
About you and Miss Walker.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.560
I think it might
have been Rawdon Briggs.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.200
And so...

47:11.120 --> 47:14.840
...he said he couldn't
associate with me any more.

47:16.640 --> 47:17.920
Because....

47:19.920 --> 47:22.120
...people say things.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.240
Which, of course...

47:25.920 --> 47:28.480
...they do.

47:33.080 --> 47:35.840
Is this why you want to go back
to Market Weighton?

47:39.680 --> 47:42.480
I do wish you luck
with it, though, Anne.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.960
I hope the Northgate Casino
will be a great success.

48:23.280 --> 48:24.400
Wish me luck.

48:24.440 --> 48:26.080
Let me look at you!

48:26.120 --> 48:28.200
Oh-ho!

48:30.600 --> 48:32.480
Don't forget the Sutherlands
are coming

48:32.520 --> 48:34.960
to tea this afternoon, if you
feel able to come downstairs

48:35.000 --> 48:36.600
when you've finished
your luncheon.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.520
Good luck.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.640
You're making
a fool of yourself!

49:01.000 --> 49:02.560
You do know that, don't you?

49:04.760 --> 49:07.640
Marian says she's thinking of
moving back to Market Weighton.

49:07.680 --> 49:10.120
And taking you with her.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.600
Mm.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.440
You would, of course,

49:17.480 --> 49:21.400
be more than welcome to
stay here with me and Adney.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.240
I'll think...

49:26.240 --> 49:27.840
If that's what she's doing...

49:29.280 --> 49:31.200
...I'll probably go with her.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.720
Oh, the carriage is here.
Excuse me.

50:22.640 --> 50:24.640
Adney.

50:24.680 --> 50:27.280
I'm very proud of you
for doing this.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.280
I just...

50:29.320 --> 50:31.520
I wanted to say thank you.

50:31.560 --> 50:34.040
It means more to me
than perhaps you realise.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.880
How are you this afternoon,
Miss Lister?

50:38.920 --> 50:39.920
Very well. Thank you.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.600
- Miss Walker!
- Mr Nelson.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.480
- Miss Lister.
- Washington.

50:43.520 --> 50:46.160
Good news, ma'am. The license
has been approved and signed.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.200
Oh, that is good news!
Did you hear that, Adney?

50:48.240 --> 50:50.240
Oh, and, ma'am,
this might not be the time,

50:50.280 --> 50:52.080
but I think you should know,

50:52.120 --> 50:53.880
I mean, I think
Miss Walker should know,

50:53.920 --> 50:55.600
apparently last night

50:55.640 --> 50:58.280
Captain Sutherland refused to
sign the division papers.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.000
Why?

51:00.040 --> 51:02.200
Apparently Mr Gray's man, Mr...

51:02.240 --> 51:04.800
- Watson.
- ...has gone back to York

51:04.840 --> 51:06.080
with the papers unsigned.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.400
How do you know?

51:08.440 --> 51:10.520
Mr Adam told me.
Mr Parker's partner.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.720
He was around here earlier.

51:14.360 --> 51:18.360
Apparently Gray's man,
Mr Watson, went to Mr Parker

51:18.400 --> 51:20.400
for advice this morning
about what to do

51:20.440 --> 51:23.640
given that Captain Sutherland
was being aggressive and nasty

51:23.680 --> 51:25.840
and making a fuss
about one of his lots being

51:25.880 --> 51:27.200
missed off the itinerary.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.240
- Which one?
- Windy End at Golcar.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.080
it wasn't. I know it was on
there, listed as being his.

51:33.120 --> 51:35.200
It was, it was,
it definitely was.

51:35.240 --> 51:37.000
And Mr Parker
told this Mr Watson

51:37.040 --> 51:40.440
it was none of his business, he
shouldn't like to get involved,

51:40.480 --> 51:42.200
and advised
he go back to York.

51:42.240 --> 51:45.120
I should never have
given the deeds to Parker!

51:45.160 --> 51:46.560
But it was Mr Gray's advice,

51:46.600 --> 51:49.320
was it not, to give the deeds
to Parker for safe-keeping?

51:49.360 --> 51:51.800
That's what
Captain Sutherland said, yes.

51:52.920 --> 51:55.080
Perhaps Mr Gray
said no such thing.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.480
- Are the Sutherlands here?
- No. I don't think so.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.720
Is Parker here?

51:59.760 --> 52:00.880
No. I don't think so.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.720
Do the speech.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.920
- What?
- Do the speech.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.440
Do the speech. Do the speech.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.720
Mr Harper?

52:16.720 --> 52:17.880
Mr Nelson.

52:19.440 --> 52:20.800
Smile.

52:23.080 --> 52:25.600
Mr Nelson...

52:25.640 --> 52:26.840
Hush, everybody, shush.

52:34.120 --> 52:38.480
I have been requested
by my friend Miss Lister...

52:40.840 --> 52:44.600
...to lay the first stone
of a casino,

52:44.640 --> 52:50.520
which will form a spacious
and commodious saloon...

52:50.560 --> 52:52.800
Shh! Shush!

52:52.840 --> 52:55.200
...to be annexed to
the Northgate Hotel.

52:56.400 --> 53:01.400
I will only add that I hope
this undertaking will prove

53:01.440 --> 53:05.040
an accommodation to
the inhabitants of this town

53:05.080 --> 53:10.320
and neighbourhood, in whose
prosperity we feel interested,

53:10.360 --> 53:13.760
and that it will be
an accommodation to the public

53:13.800 --> 53:19.240
at large, and that it will do
credit to those individuals

53:19.280 --> 53:21.800
concerned in its erection.

53:23.560 --> 53:26.360
- Very well said!
- Quite right!

53:27.840 --> 53:30.080
- Here?
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

53:35.080 --> 53:36.320
Well done.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.760
That's wonderful.

53:48.800 --> 53:49.840
We can sort it out later.

53:49.880 --> 53:51.120
Mr Nelson!

53:51.160 --> 53:54.040
My friend Miss Walker
has done us great honour,

53:54.080 --> 53:57.280
and I trust her good wishes
will not be in vain.

53:57.320 --> 53:59.960
I earnestly hope
the work we begin now

54:00.000 --> 54:01.560
will do credit to us all.

54:01.600 --> 54:04.520
May the voice of discord be
never heard within its walls,

54:04.560 --> 54:08.200
and may persons of
every shade of varying opinion

54:08.240 --> 54:10.680
meet together here
in amity and in charity.

54:10.720 --> 54:11.800
Very well said.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.840
Three cheers for
t'Northgate Casino. Hip hip...

54:14.880 --> 54:16.560
Hurray!
- Hip hip.

54:16.600 --> 54:17.640
- Hurray!
- Hip hip.

54:17.680 --> 54:20.000
Hurray!

54:22.760 --> 54:23.840
Thank you.

54:29.720 --> 54:32.120
Trinity Road. Quickly.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.040
- Sackville?
- Hello.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.480
They must be in with him.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.760
- I want to see Mr Parker.
- He's with someone.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.240
He'll probably be half an hour
or so...

54:47.280 --> 54:49.720
Yes, I know exactly
who he's with!

54:49.760 --> 54:52.520
We must go in. You've got
to insist that we go in.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.640
I think we should go home.

54:54.680 --> 54:56.480
No!

54:56.520 --> 54:58.920
I think
if we confront him here,

54:58.960 --> 55:01.680
it could cause
more problems than it solves.

55:01.720 --> 55:03.560
He'll take the deeds!

55:03.600 --> 55:04.960
Parker won't give them to him.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.520
It's more than
his reputation's worth.

55:08.560 --> 55:09.880
I don't trust Parker!

55:10.960 --> 55:14.760
We have no real evidence that
Parker has colluded with him.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.960
If we burst in there making
accusations, it could

55:17.000 --> 55:18.480
make us look...

55:18.520 --> 55:19.920
...unhinged.

55:26.920 --> 55:30.280
Are you still coming to us
for tea today, Sackville?

55:31.560 --> 55:32.840
I think so.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.040
Good.

55:45.280 --> 55:49.440
I don't quite know what to say,
Captain Sutherland.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.760
It is a bizarre situation, Parker.

55:54.160 --> 55:57.360
I've analysed it
with great care, sir,

55:57.400 --> 56:01.120
and these are my considered
and regrettable conclusions.

56:02.520 --> 56:06.240
You can see how traumatised
Mrs Sutherland is.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.040
And do you see?

56:10.080 --> 56:12.160
The solution is in your hands.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.960
If I can take the deeds,
all of them,

56:17.000 --> 56:18.320
and delay the whole thing

56:18.360 --> 56:21.240
until I can show that
Miss Walker has systematically,

56:21.280 --> 56:24.680
day after day, week after week,
month after month,

56:24.720 --> 56:27.160
been corrupted,

56:27.200 --> 56:29.800
and isn't able to make
her own choices reliably

56:29.840 --> 56:32.040
about anything any more...

56:34.120 --> 56:39.320
I know the Lister family is an
old and valued client of yours

56:39.360 --> 56:41.960
and they're very
highly regarded.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.320
Parker...

56:44.440 --> 56:46.560
...Miss Lister is a predator.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.920
In more senses than one.

56:50.960 --> 56:53.600
And if what she's doing
isn't criminal, well, then,

56:53.640 --> 56:56.920
good heavens, I'm not at all
sure what the law is for.

57:00.040 --> 57:01.400
You surely...

57:03.080 --> 57:07.280
You don't expect me to
simply hand the Crow Nest deeds

57:07.320 --> 57:10.880
over to you, just, just...

57:10.920 --> 57:12.080
...just like that?

57:17.720 --> 57:20.120
When Miss Walker
was in Scotland with us..,

57:21.280 --> 57:23.960
...and I presume
this isn't widely known...

57:25.520 --> 57:28.000
...she attempted
to take her own life.

57:29.640 --> 57:33.440
And all because
of this unnatural obsession

57:33.480 --> 57:35.360
she has with Miss Lister.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.920
Do you understand, Parker?

57:40.800 --> 57:43.400
She needs protecting
from herself.

57:46.160 --> 57:50.200
So, yes,
I am asking for all the deeds,

57:50.240 --> 57:52.520
and believe you me, sir, heaven...

57:53.800 --> 57:55.240
...and one day, I'm certain,

57:55.280 --> 57:57.240
Miss Walker
and her entire family...

57:59.680 --> 58:00.880
...will thank you for it.

58:55.120 --> 58:57.320
Captain and Mrs Sutherland,
ma'am.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.400
Ah! There you are.

58:58.440 --> 58:59.840
How disappointed we were

58:59.880 --> 59:01.920
not to see you
at our little ceremony.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.160
It went very well.

59:04.200 --> 59:07.440
This is my Swiss model.
Isn't she splendid?

59:07.480 --> 59:09.560
Adney's in the drawing room.
Do go through.

59:09.600 --> 59:12.880
George. Could you bring us
some tea?

59:12.920 --> 59:14.520
Adney spoke beautifully.

59:14.560 --> 59:16.360
It's a shame you missed it.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.920
We drew quite a crowd.

59:18.960 --> 59:22.120
The townspeople were delighted.
They gave us three cheers.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.880
We learned this afternoon
that you didn't sign

59:25.920 --> 59:27.040
for the division last night.

59:27.080 --> 59:28.480
I'm afraid not.
We found anomalies.

59:28.520 --> 59:30.520
Windy End at Golcar.
It's here.

59:30.560 --> 59:33.280
It's listed as "The Plantation,
Golcar", and to be fair

59:33.320 --> 59:35.680
it's in the wrong place,
but it's the same lot

59:35.720 --> 59:38.080
and it's here and the matter
might've been settled

59:38.120 --> 59:39.800
easily enough by
taking two minutes

59:39.840 --> 59:41.520
to walk from Cliffe Hill
to Crow Nest to

59:41.560 --> 59:43.600
consult Mr Washington on
the matter before choosing

59:43.640 --> 59:45.920
to bully poor Mr Watson
into returning to York

59:45.960 --> 59:48.360
- with the thing left unsigned.
- Shh. Ann.

59:48.400 --> 59:50.320
Shh. You're
getting overwrought,

59:50.360 --> 59:52.520
and this, I'm afraid,

59:52.560 --> 59:54.280
- is part of the problem.
- The only problem

59:54.320 --> 59:57.520
is the inconvenience
you'll put Mr Watson to when

59:57.560 --> 59:58.880
he has to come
back over again

59:58.920 --> 1:00:00.400
from York for your signatures!

1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:02.080
Ann. We're not
going to sign the thing.

1:00:02.120 --> 1:00:04.640
Why? Why?

1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:07.120
I've spoken to Mr Gray
and Mr Parker,

1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:10.760
we're all excellent friends,
and I have to tell you now

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:11.880
that they both agree with me

1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:13.720
that this is not a good idea. And...

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:17.120
- ...you do know why.
- Mr Gray?

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:19.360
Why would Mr Gray agree
with you after all the trouble

1:00:19.400 --> 1:00:20.800
he's gone to
to write the document

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:22.360
for the division
in the first place?

1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:23.920
I think that's unlikely.

1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:25.720
I would like to speak to
Miss Walker alone.

1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:26.760
- Of course.
- No!

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:28.840
No! Anything you have to say
to me, you can say

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:31.360
in front of my... Miss Lister.

1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:36.280
Very well, I will say it
in front of your Miss Lister.

1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:37.840
It's the same thing
I said to you before.

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:39.840
I believe you have been bullied

1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:42.080
and coerced
against your better judgment

1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:44.280
to ask for something you can't
possibly manage alone.

1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:45.760
- That's nonsense.
- And I believe

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:48.920
that behind all this is
a malicious, unnatural

1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:50.920
influence of
gross self-interest...

1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:53.480
No. You won't sign it because
you have some bizarre idea

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:55.600
- that it's somehow all yours.
- That's... No.

1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:56.840
- That's...
- Or you're lashing out

1:00:56.880 --> 1:00:58.840
because I wouldn't marry
your insipid cousin.

1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:01.080
I'm trying to protect you, Ann.

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:03.360
Against...

1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:08.520
...against your
not very good judgment.

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:12.200
Now, Mr Gray and Mr Parker,
now that I've spoken to them,

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:14.360
both have a much better
understanding of what is

1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:17.120
going on here, and believe you
me, they were both shocked.

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:19.120
- What are you talking about?
- I urge you

1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:22.600
to come, with Elizabeth
and myself, back to Cliffe Hill

1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.120
and away from this...

1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:25.880
...this...this...

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:28.200
Ma'am? Mr Gray's here.
From York.

1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:33.360
Shall I ask him to wait?

1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:36.960
No.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.400
No, no, no. George,
don't do that. Show him in.

1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:43.960
I might go and wait

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.200
- in another room.
- Why?

1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:47.960
If you got on with him
so nicely with him in York,

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.760
surely you'd be more than happy
to see him.

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:51.600
- You... You've...
- It isn't true!

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:54.920
Neither Mr Gray nor
Mr Parker said anything

1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.480
against this division.

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:00.600
This is wrong.

1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:01.680
It's hers.

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.720
It's hers,
and she should have it,

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.440
if this is what she wants.

1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:13.560
Mr Samuel Gray, ma'am.

1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:18.200
Oh...

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:19.720
<i>...that</i> Mr Gray!

1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:22.800
How do you do?

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:25.440
Very well, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:27.080
This is Mr Samuel Gray.

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:31.120
Mr Harper's landscape gardener
from York.

1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:33.280
George, could you take Mr Gray

1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:36.120
into the kitchen? Ask
Cordingley to get him some tea.

1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:38.000
And I'll sort you out
in a few minutes,

1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:39.640
if that's all right with you,
Mr Gray.

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:47.040
I fear you have built me up in
your mind, Captain Sutherland,

1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:51.080
to be all manner of things
I am not.

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:55.080
And some that I am.

1:02:56.080 --> 1:02:57.840
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:02.360
...I have my own estate to run.

1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:05.040
Mm.

1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:07.800
Is everything perfectly clear,
Captain Sutherland?

1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:09.000
Perfectly.

1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:14.200
Well, if you'd just
sign there, please.

1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000
<i>My darling girl,</i>

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:04.040
<i>I'm sure you will grieve
to hear that my darling mother</i>

1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:07.600
<i>expired this evening
at ten minutes past five,</i>

1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:09.160
<i>in Charlotte's arms,</i>

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:12.640
<i>surrounded by all her children,
and Rose and Ellen.</i>

1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:17.640
<i>She went off in her sleep
and I think did not suffer.</i>

1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:19.480
<i>I have not time
to write more now,</i>

1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:22.200
<i>as we are all
in great affliction.</i>

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:25.720
<i>She was always
so very, very fond of you,</i>

1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:27.840
<i>and I know you were of her,</i>

1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:29.840
<i>and that you above all people</i>

1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:32.320
<i>will share our sorrow
most keenly.</i>

1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:35.040
<i>God bless you, my dearest Anne.</i>

1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:37.520
<i>Your own Isabella.</i>

1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:08.880
Should I say goodbye to him?

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:10.240
That's up to you.

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:18.760
Goodbye, Captain Sutherland.

1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:24.000
Goodbye, Ann.

1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:25.200
My dear.

1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:35.800
Hello.

1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:39.760
- Miss Lister.
- Mrs Sutherland.

1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:44.600
Goodbye.

1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:47.720
Goodbye.

1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:54.320
Write to us when you get home,
so we know

1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:56.520
- you got there safely.
- I will.

1:05:57.640 --> 1:05:59.040
When will I see you again?

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:04.520
I don't know.

1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:08.400
One day.

1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:10.720
Mm.

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:09.640
We should go to York on Monday.

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:12.480
And sort out our wills.

1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:15.000
Is that what you want?

1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:17.920
I'm sorry.

1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:19.720
For what?

1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:21.640
Doubting it.

1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:24.280
Don't be.

1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:28.360
We...

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:32.720
...are the only people in
the whole world, on Earth,

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:34.320
who want us to be together.

1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:37.480
It won't be easy.

1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:40.960
It'll never be easy.

1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:43.840
But we're both still here.

1:07:43.880 --> 1:07:44.920
Aren't we? Hmm?
