I go to the batting cages

13:01.281 --> 13:02.573
Does that work?

13:02.657 --> 13:05.618
The results are inconclusive.
Just make sure to wear a cup.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.835
I just want to talk to Julia.

-Well, then, go talk to Julia.
-I can't, my mom won't let me.

You are your own man, Sam.
You can do whatever you want.

-You can wear pants backwards.
-Why would I want to?

It's getting away from me.

against your hot mom's wishes--

I mean, she is a wise <i>tour de force.</i>

13:35.106 --> 13:38.651

13:38.735 --> 13:40.445
[jaunty tune playing]

So in that way,
I wouldn't even call it therapy,

It's not your fault.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.917
-Alright, sweetie?
-[Casey sniffs]

25:02.751 --> 25:06.422
It was a little stupid,
but you're a teenager, you know?

25:06.505 --> 25:07.464
That's what...

25:08.048 --> 25:09.675
That's what teenagers do.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.178
I'm sorry I let you down.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.307
-I never should have fought with Sam.
-It's okay.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.771
Looks like he got some shots in, huh?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.023
[chuckles]

25:24.106 --> 25:28.402
-Actually, I think that I punched myself.
-Yeah, your brother didn't beat you up?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.820
[chuckles] No.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.905
It's okay, sweetie.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.198
Alright?

25:33.782 --> 25:35.617
-I love you.
-I love you, Dad.

25:36.869 --> 25:37.870
[Elsa] Ahh!

25:38.203 --> 25:40.622
There you are,
I've been calling your cell.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.292
Are you okay? How was work?

25:43.375 --> 25:48.047
I was 46 minutes late to work because
we passed Julia's stop on the bus.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.841
So I decided to get off to see Julia.
So I saw Julia.

25:50.924 --> 25:51.925
What?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.761
I saw Julia. I've said it two times now.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.805
Honey, I know you might be angry with me,

25:56.889 --> 25:59.725
but I specifically told you
not to see her.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.896
I don't know if I'm angry with you.
I don't know how I feel.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.649
-But that's okay sometimes.
-Okay.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.694
So how was it seeing her again?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.489
-Honey, talk to me.
-No.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.824
-Dad!
-Hey.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.243
-You're back?
-I'm back.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.745
Good. You missed a lot.

26:19.995 --> 26:23.957
We got this ugly new Merry Christmas sign
and Casey told me that Mom cheated.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.667
Yeah.

26:27.044 --> 26:30.214
Oh, and Mom changed the spice rub.
Bad idea.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.302
So... you're back.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.678
Yeah, I'm coming home.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.848
-Oh, honey...
-So you need to leave.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.559
What?

26:47.648 --> 26:51.193
-Don't be silly. I can't leave the kids.
-Neither can I.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.488
[stammers] I've been gone a few days,
and this is what's happening?

26:54.571 --> 26:55.989
They're attacking each other?

26:56.073 --> 26:58.575
-Sam hasn't done that in years.
-I know, but...

26:58.659 --> 27:01.829
I made the mistake of leaving the family
once before, I'm not doing it again.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.247
-Then let's both stay.
-No.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.957
-I can sleep on the couch.
-No.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.793
-We can work through everything.
-I can't be around you.

27:08.001 --> 27:08.836
-Doug.
-I can't.

27:08.919 --> 27:09.753
Please.

27:09.837 --> 27:13.423
Do you want me to tell you
how much you disgust me?

27:16.009 --> 27:17.344
You disgust me.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.305
Um...

27:20.931 --> 27:23.433
Okay, I'll... I'll leave in the morning.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.727
It's probably best if you leave tonight.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.813
[Doug takes deep breath]

27:40.200 --> 27:42.536
-[door knocking]
-Yeah?

27:46.248 --> 27:49.710
You got me a new toothbrush
and you put it in the right hole.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.004
Yeah, Mom has, like, a million spares.

27:53.839 --> 27:54.882
Sam...

27:56.758 --> 27:57.801
I'm really sorry.

27:58.594 --> 27:59.595
I know.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.266
I used my employee discount
to get you these mechanical pencils

28:04.349 --> 28:05.851
for your first day of school.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.395
Seven millimeters.
I know that's your preferred lead width.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.483
Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.028
I'm your big brother.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.739
I can take care of you sometimes too.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.620
[door closes]

28:26.872 --> 28:28.874
[door bell]

28:31.877 --> 28:35.589
Hi, here's the baby.
Thank you so much for watching her.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.216
We will be back on Tuesday.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.719
Her eye drops are in this bag.
Twice a day, easy-breezy.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.639
There you go, little monkey. Oh, yes!

28:43.722 --> 28:46.141
And I will make sure
to talk to Tamara for you.

28:46.266 --> 28:50.395
Dr. Brob, I mean. To me,
she's just Tamra. Anyway, gotta run.

28:50.479 --> 28:54.566
Chris is in the car waiting.
Bye, my little cutie-shmootie. [chuckles]

28:54.650 --> 28:56.276
Be good to her or I'll kill you.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.072
I'm kidding, I won't kill you.
No, I will kill you. Have a good one!
