WEBVTT

00:54.400 --> 00:57.700
We are the species that explores,

00:57.800 --> 01:02.700
that fashions vessels
to carry us into the unknown.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.980
We sailed the planet of our birth,

01:05.080 --> 01:08.500
saw its wonders and made it home.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.820
And it wasn't enough.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.340
We built flying machines

01:13.440 --> 01:18.020
to explore higher, faster, farther.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.860
Heroes flew them beyond
what once seemed possible.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.962
And it wasn't enough.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.580
In time, we created special craft

01:31.680 --> 01:36.368
that would ferry us
to the edge of space and back.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.500
And as always, there were the few...

01:42.600 --> 01:43.886
brave and brilliant souls...

01:44.280 --> 01:46.740
ready to guide this vessel through dangers

01:46.840 --> 01:49.420
in the name of discovery.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.967
Using the space shuttle,

02:24.080 --> 02:28.324
we built an unprecedented
outpost in the heavens.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.940
We learned in the weightless world
of the International Space Station,

02:37.040 --> 02:40.980
peered into the dark night
of an infinite universe.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.162
And it wasn't enough.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.900
Now we are fashioning vessels to set off

02:48.000 --> 02:50.940
on our greatest adventure
of exploration ever:

02:51.040 --> 02:53.441
to Mars and beyond.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.968
Who knew that 30 years
would go by so quickly?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.940
That these unique spacecraft

03:20.040 --> 03:23.140
would leave in their wake
a public captivated

03:23.240 --> 03:24.620
by their achievements...

03:28.960 --> 03:31.620
...a planet poised at the brink

03:31.720 --> 03:34.929
of deep-space exploration.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.900
As an astronaut, I definitely felt

04:12.000 --> 04:16.089
I was saying good-bye to a long-time
friend when the last shuttle landed.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.020
My name is Chris Ferguson.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.580
I was lucky enough to fly
on three shuttle missions,

04:39.680 --> 04:41.540
one of them on Endeavour.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.608
So it's no surprise
that I wanted to be there

04:43.720 --> 04:46.100
when she was headed for her new home

04:46.200 --> 04:49.488
at the California Science Center
in Los Angeles.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.940
From the look of it,
you might think it took

04:54.040 --> 04:55.700
as much engineering to get Endeavour

04:55.800 --> 04:58.804
through the streets of L.A.
as launching her into orbit.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.220
Watching the orbiter squeeze
through the city neighborhoods,

05:20.320 --> 05:23.642
you could feel just how much the
shuttle had come to stand for,

05:23.760 --> 05:26.843
almost as if it had taken
all of us into space.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.603
I sure don't want the world to forget

05:38.720 --> 05:40.722
this remarkable spacecraft
and those who built it,

05:40.920 --> 05:43.420
and the legacy they left,

05:43.520 --> 05:46.251
lighting the way toward
our next frontier in space.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.740
They're coming.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.681
The shuttle was the first
reusable piloted spacecraft.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.300
And its engineering and software
was so bulletproof,

05:57.400 --> 06:00.890
it could be flown by computers
less powerful than today's smartphones.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.929
Two hundred.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.020
One hundred.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.122
At 235 miles per hour,

06:08.360 --> 06:11.300
the shuttle had
the fastest touchdown speed

06:11.400 --> 06:14.860
of any flying vehicle ever built.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.362
When you glide 220,000 pounds
of spacecraft

06:18.480 --> 06:22.940
to a no-power landing,
the gear hits with a major whomp.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.320
Touchdown.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.860
Conceived in the 1970s

06:31.960 --> 06:34.060
as a kind of winged delivery truck

06:34.160 --> 06:37.687
to build a United States
low-Earth-orbit space station...

06:37.920 --> 06:39.540
Give you a payload I.D. of one.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.220
...the shuttle actually flew

06:41.320 --> 06:44.449
more than a decade beyond
original expectations.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.081
It was the shuttle program
that allowed us to do

06:50.400 --> 06:53.300
real ongoing work in space,

06:53.400 --> 06:56.340
to put delicate equipment
into orbit and to retrieve

06:56.440 --> 06:58.602
and fix that equipment
when things went wrong.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.460
Orbiters deployed, retrieved and repaired

07:54.560 --> 07:57.564
over a hundred scientific
and communications satellites.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.100
And no missions were more
important to our understanding

08:02.200 --> 08:05.761
of deep space than the
five flights, beginning in 1993,

08:05.880 --> 08:08.884
made to repair and upgrade
the Hubble Space Telescope.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.940
Hubble affirmative.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.168
You have a go for release.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.241
I think history will view
the Hubble Space Telescope

08:27.360 --> 08:30.045
as one of the crowning
achievements in astronomy.

08:36.360 --> 08:40.682
The Hubble gave us an unprecedented
view of both our closest neighbors

08:40.960 --> 08:44.760
and of galaxies
unimaginably far from our own.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.340
Further space telescope
investigations have revealed

08:54.440 --> 08:58.522
that the number of Earth-like planets
capable of harboring liquid water

08:58.840 --> 09:01.764
is vastly greater than
scientists once calculated.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.660
In 1995, the shuttles began

09:44.760 --> 09:47.540
a new era of
international space exploration

09:47.640 --> 09:51.563
when Atlantis docked, for the first time,
with the Russian MIR station.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.860
Eight inches.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.340
One-oh-point-oh-seven.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.020
One-oh-six.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.900
Four inches.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.129
Now. We have capture.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.900
Altogether, the orbiters
made 11 trips to visit Mir.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.860
These missions established a level
of international cooperation and expertise

10:16.960 --> 10:18.962
that continues to this day.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.860
Though MIR no longer orbits Earth,

10:23.960 --> 10:27.100
the shuttle proved itself
as a brilliant reusable tool

10:27.200 --> 10:30.620
that allowed us to live,
build and do science

10:30.720 --> 10:32.722
in the weightless environment of space.

10:58.840 --> 11:03.526
But the shuttles' truest legacy crosses
the sky above us every 90 minutes.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.723
The International Space Station
could never have been built

11:09.880 --> 11:12.451
without the shuttles' payload
and space-walk capabilities.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.980
Space shuttles and Russian
Soyuz and Proton rockets

11:20.080 --> 11:23.484
made more than 40 flights to construct
the International Space Station...

11:23.680 --> 11:25.842
a true engineering miracle.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.206
All three of my Orbiter missions
were to the ISS.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.220
Modules built by NASA partners in Asia,

11:44.320 --> 11:47.380
Europe and North America,
came together above Earth,

11:47.480 --> 11:51.740
over a period of 13 years,
to create a floating world

11:51.840 --> 11:53.740
longer than a football field

11:53.840 --> 11:56.923
and with more living space
than a six-bedroom house.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.900
A typical ISS mission
requires an astronaut

12:04.000 --> 12:06.100
to live six months onboard.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.060
But some crew members will spend a year

12:09.160 --> 12:12.100
learning even more
about the very real physical

12:12.200 --> 12:14.500
and psychological stresses

12:14.600 --> 12:17.331
of long-term separation from Earth.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.900
These missions and the 15 nations

12:23.000 --> 12:25.860
that designed, built and crew the ISS,

12:25.960 --> 12:28.260
forever changed space exploration

12:28.360 --> 12:30.740
into a cooperative international program

12:30.840 --> 12:34.060
and made a true home
and science lab like no other.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.380
# Wash away my troubles #

12:36.480 --> 12:38.289
# Wash away my pain #

12:38.400 --> 12:41.540
# With the rain in Shambala... #

12:41.640 --> 12:45.620
ISS system designs
and scientific experiments

12:45.720 --> 12:48.420
have spawned a multitude
of Earth-useful discoveries,

12:48.520 --> 12:49.700
including breakthroughs

12:49.800 --> 12:53.420
in water purification
and robotic microsurgery.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.804
But most important, the ISS
is our springboard to the future,

12:57.920 --> 13:00.300
giving us the knowledge and confidence

13:00.400 --> 13:04.540
to sustain human life
as we explore deep space.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.900
# Everyone is helpful #

13:07.000 --> 13:08.820
# Everyone is kind... #

13:08.920 --> 13:12.980
Life on ISS is all about getting
the job done and having a little fun.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.980
# Everyone is lucky #

13:15.080 --> 13:16.900
# Everyone is so kind #

13:17.000 --> 13:19.780
# On the road to Shambala... #

13:19.880 --> 13:22.500
And nationality is mostly

13:22.600 --> 13:24.500
about tasting each other's food.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.820
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

13:27.920 --> 13:30.260
# Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh #

13:30.360 --> 13:32.740
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah #

13:32.840 --> 13:36.340
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... #

13:36.440 --> 13:40.020
Through three decades
of camaraderie and dedication,

13:40.120 --> 13:43.780
355 people rode the shuttle into history.

13:43.880 --> 13:47.100
They circled the Earth 21,000 times,

13:47.200 --> 13:50.180
and it all came to seem routine....

13:50.280 --> 13:51.820
until it wasn't.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.180
...one minute, 15 seconds.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.820
Velocity 2,900 feet per second.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.180
Altitude nine nautical miles.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.260
Downrange distance seven nautical miles.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.820
This shuttle mission will launch...

13:59.920 --> 14:01.540
My God!

14:01.640 --> 14:03.540
There's been an explosion.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.660
Flight controllers here looking
very carefully at the situation.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.700
Obviously a major malfunction.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.180
In two accidents that stunned the world,

14:13.280 --> 14:15.380
we lost 14 astronauts.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.980
It was a sobering reminder
that every space flight

14:19.080 --> 14:22.460
is charged with potential danger.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.820
They had a hunger to explore the universe

14:24.920 --> 14:26.460
and discover its truths.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.847
They wished to serve, and they did.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.540
They were pioneers.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.740
The future doesn't belong
to the fainthearted.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.081
It belongs to the brave.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.820
The world mourned, but pushed on,

14:47.920 --> 14:50.740
because the accomplishments
of the space shuttle

14:50.840 --> 14:52.580
and the International Space Station

14:52.680 --> 14:56.340
were full of life-changing promise.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.887
In memory of our lost heroes,
the global space community

15:00.000 --> 15:04.164
pulled together to reignite
the future of both programs.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.860
Who could ask
for a better ending to my career

15:08.960 --> 15:12.620
as an astronaut than getting to fly
the last shuttle mission on Atlantis,

15:12.720 --> 15:15.803
and a final visit to the ISS.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.300
Atlantis launch director,
air to ground one.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.209
Atlantis go.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.900
And so, for the final time, Fergie, Doug,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.940
Sandy and Rex, good luck, Godspeed,
and have a little fun up there.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.380
We're not ending the journey today, Mike,

15:37.480 --> 15:40.260
we're completing a chapter of
a journey that will never end.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.780
You and the thousands of men and women

15:41.880 --> 15:43.940
who gave their hearts,
souls and their lives

15:44.040 --> 15:46.980
for the cause of exploration,
have rewritten history.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.321
Let's light this fire one more time, Mike.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.220
Though the shuttles no longer fly,

16:59.320 --> 17:04.086
I never miss a chance to see Atlantis
at the Kennedy Space Center.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.819
But I came to KSC to get a look
at the next big step

17:10.920 --> 17:15.289
in deep-space exploration,
and it's called Orion.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.362
Here, in the giant operations
and checkout clean room,

17:24.480 --> 17:26.859
the new Orion multi-purposed crew vehicle

17:26.960 --> 17:28.660
is coming together.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.620
What an impressive vehicle.
Look at that... it's beautiful.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.820
It's gorgeous. I'd love to climb in there.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.540
Orion is a true deep-space
exploration craft,

17:39.640 --> 17:41.961
designed to carry astronauts of the future

17:42.080 --> 17:47.644
back to the moon,
to asteroids, and even to Mars.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.900
I've always been drawn to explore
and try new experiences.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.860
Maybe that's why I applied
to be an astronaut.

17:59.960 --> 18:04.684
I'm Serena Aunon, and I am one of the
newer group of astronauts chosen by NASA.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.900
Like the rest of my class,
I'm absolutely honored

18:14.000 --> 18:17.340
and humbled to be here,
and it's great to be a part of this team.

18:18.940 --> 18:20.740
I guess you could say I'm one

18:20.840 --> 18:23.580
of those people for whom
the future has always seemed

18:23.680 --> 18:25.700
an unfolding adventure.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.420
So you can go forward
and backwards in the procedure

18:28.520 --> 18:30.380
just by using
this toggle switch over here.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.766
Yes, that, exactly.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.380
Learning from astronauts,

18:33.480 --> 18:36.940
like Lee Morin, who have
already spent weeks in space,

18:37.040 --> 18:39.691
gives you a great sense of confidence.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.100
The Orion mock-up provides
astronauts in training,

18:45.200 --> 18:47.940
like Serena, a chance
to learn flight procedures,

18:48.040 --> 18:50.900
and also give feedback
to perfect new systems.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.780
This should be a piece of cake for Serena,

18:53.880 --> 18:57.300
since my shuttle's ten screens
and more than a thousand switches

18:57.400 --> 18:59.460
have been streamlined
to just three screens

18:59.560 --> 19:02.220
and 60 switches on Orion.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.060
Hey, Lee, you can open
the helium cross-feed valve.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.460
Okay, we got that, so go ahead
and send that command

19:07.560 --> 19:09.780
- on the helium cross-feed valve.
- All right, copy that.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.220
And the shuttle's hundred pounds

19:11.320 --> 19:14.820
of flight manuals and checklists
have been reduced to...

19:14.920 --> 19:18.140
well... zero, since Orion's
are all on computer.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.820
Stand by, and we'll evaluate.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.940
But even with all these improvements,

19:22.040 --> 19:24.140
to get Orion into deep space,

19:24.240 --> 19:26.925
we're gonna need a bigger rocket.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.620
When NASA's giant space launch system,

19:32.720 --> 19:34.660
built by Boeing, is complete,

19:34.760 --> 19:38.340
the rocket will stand
as tall as a 38-story building

19:38.440 --> 19:41.780
and make more than
nine million pounds of thrust,

19:41.880 --> 19:45.521
enough to lift 22 elephants into space.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.820
For deep-space expeditions,

19:48.920 --> 19:52.180
the SLS will need to lift
five key mission components

19:52.280 --> 19:54.408
beyond low-Earth orbit.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.500
Since Orion is too cramped
for a six-month journey to Mars,

19:59.600 --> 20:03.140
one solution being developed
is an inflatable habitat

20:03.240 --> 20:05.971
to house the crew en route.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.020
A solar electric
propulsion device will provide

20:11.120 --> 20:13.646
continuous power
for the round-trip journey.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.860
A lander craft will carry the
crew from their orbit above Mars

20:19.960 --> 20:23.380
down to the planet's surface.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.820
Months later, an ascent vehicle

20:24.920 --> 20:28.003
will lift the crew back up
to the orbiting Orion

20:28.120 --> 20:30.780
for the return trip to Earth.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.540
But even using the most sophisticated

20:34.640 --> 20:37.180
future spacecraft, a two-and-a-half year

20:37.280 --> 20:38.900
round-trip journey to Mars

20:39.000 --> 20:42.380
will present new challenges
to the human body.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.060
I wanted to thank the Indiana
State Museum for having me here.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.180
It is an absolute pleasure.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.380
As a medical doctor with a
specialty in aerospace medicine,

20:50.480 --> 20:53.500
I am particularly interested
in keeping astronauts healthy

20:53.600 --> 20:57.366
as we head into deep space
for long periods of time.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.900
Our experience with more
extended weightlessness

21:03.000 --> 21:06.820
on the ISS has shown us that the
human body will face challenges

21:06.920 --> 21:10.163
during lengthy journeys to deep space.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.420
Key issues are muscle and bone loss,

21:14.520 --> 21:17.660
which can start after just
a few days of weightlessness,

21:17.760 --> 21:21.420
along with degrading
of vision for some astronauts.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.380
We now know that exercise is the antidote

21:24.480 --> 21:27.420
for most problems
caused by weightlessness.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.522
And I mean exercise...

21:29.640 --> 21:31.642
about two hours a day.

21:33.120 --> 21:37.380
But, even so, the first explorers to Mars
will need to rest at least a few days

21:37.480 --> 21:40.180
after landing on the planet
to readjust to walking,

21:40.280 --> 21:43.568
though Mars has less than
40% of Earth's gravity.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.485
Radiation is another risk in deep space.

21:54.800 --> 21:58.650
Radiation from our sun's solar storms
is one source of danger.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.420
But cosmic radiation, which
permeates all of deep space,

22:05.520 --> 22:08.410
is another ever-present
challenge to human health.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.940
Sections of Orion,
as well as the transit habitat,

22:14.040 --> 22:17.607
will have to serve as a shelter
in the case of a major solar flare.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.460
In the Arizona desert,
an Orion mock-up is being drop-tested

22:28.560 --> 22:31.245
to evaluate reentry systems.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.740
On returning from deep space,
Orion will enter our atmosphere

22:37.840 --> 22:40.860
more than 50% faster

22:40.960 --> 22:43.420
than shuttles or Soyuz capsules,

22:43.520 --> 22:46.140
and generate five times more heat,

22:46.240 --> 22:49.180
so perfecting her parachute deployment

22:49.280 --> 22:52.124
and heat shield is key to crew survival.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.260
At the Kennedy Space Center,
Orion is being prepped

23:00.360 --> 23:04.380
for an uncrewed
test flight into deep space.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.780
This new vessel marks
the first step in over 40 years

23:08.880 --> 23:12.965
to put humans beyond low Earth orbit.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.300
A journey to Mars is on the horizon

23:18.400 --> 23:21.180
because of wide-ranging
international efforts

23:21.280 --> 23:24.220
by both governments
and private enterprise.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.060
Companies from Boeing and Lockheed

23:27.160 --> 23:30.180
to newcomers like SpaceX, Sierra Nevada

23:30.280 --> 23:33.740
and Orbital Sciences
are developing spacecraft

23:33.840 --> 23:36.764
to service the ISS and beyond.

23:38.240 --> 23:41.180
Some private groups
foresee a technically simpler

23:41.280 --> 23:44.740
one-way mission to colonize Mars.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.140
Already thousands have volunteered

23:47.240 --> 23:49.925
to live permanently on the Red Planet.

23:51.840 --> 23:55.100
The demands of going to deep space

23:55.200 --> 23:58.100
will push old designs to new limits.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.340
- Looks good.
- Looks good. Hey.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.260
- New glove. Should be good.
- Sounds good.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.100
My name is Lindsey Aitchison
and I am a spacesuit project engineer

24:07.200 --> 24:09.540
at NASA Johnson Space Center.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.180
I first started thinking
about space flight

24:12.280 --> 24:14.900
when I was four years old,
when I first came to JSC

24:15.000 --> 24:18.447
to take a tour at the visitor's center.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.780
We have pictures of me just
sitting inside this spacesuit,

24:20.880 --> 24:23.121
and I just knew
that's what I wanted to do.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.300
No, dad-gum it.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.580
When the Apollo suits were first done,

24:33.680 --> 24:35.740
those were very short-duration EVAs.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.260
We didn't have a lot
of mobility in that suit,

24:38.360 --> 24:40.380
so when you see
those astronauts hopping around

24:40.480 --> 24:43.260
on the lunar surface,
it's not because they themselves

24:43.360 --> 24:46.807
are clumsy or that the gravity
is just impossible to deal with.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.140
We didn't give them enough
mobility in the suits.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.924
So we learned a lot from that.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.660
For the next generation suit,
there's still a lot that we don't know

24:58.760 --> 25:02.922
about what it's going to be like to live
and work on Mars every day.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.060
Once there, you'd be doing EVA,

25:07.160 --> 25:09.208
walking outside on the planet
about every other day.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.900
Once we have the hardware
in-house, we become the experts

25:19.000 --> 25:21.820
of how that hardware works, what it does,

25:21.920 --> 25:23.500
and how it meets the needs

25:23.600 --> 25:26.444
for our next phase of our mission design.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.780
We actually get into the suits,
because the best way

25:40.880 --> 25:45.281
to understand how a spacesuit moves
is to be inside of it and work it yourself.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.060
I'll be asking Richard
to perform specific tasks.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.740
And what I'm looking at is:
What is his gait like?

25:54.840 --> 25:57.580
And so I'm watching how
the bearings in the hip move

25:57.680 --> 26:00.180
and how the bearings in the waist move.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.100
And by comparing natural body
motion to suited body motion

26:03.200 --> 26:07.220
we can start to tweak the design
of the suit to make it more natural.

26:07.320 --> 26:10.220
So that's what we're
focusing on for exploration...

26:10.320 --> 26:12.940
is how do you walk, how do you
bend, how do you kneel,

26:13.040 --> 26:15.691
how do you do all
those geology-type tasks?

26:33.160 --> 26:35.100
So, one of the big problems
they had in Apollo

26:35.200 --> 26:37.780
was all of that dust on the lunar surface.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.620
It stuck to everything.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.900
When the guys would come back
inside of the lunar module

26:42.000 --> 26:44.220
at the end of their EVAs,
taking off their suits,

26:44.320 --> 26:47.060
there was dirt everywhere...
there was dirt on themselves.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.162
It was just gross, right?

26:56.320 --> 26:58.420
And that dirt is actually pretty
harmful... the lunar dirt...

26:58.520 --> 27:00.660
specifically, to breathe in
for long periods of time,

27:00.760 --> 27:02.660
so, long-duration missions,
we wouldn't want to

27:02.760 --> 27:05.081
bring that dirt inside
with us all the time.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.250
All right, Richard. Nice job.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.500
Time to come on in.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.820
So one of the key
concepts we're looking at

27:17.920 --> 27:22.605
for lunar and even Martian missions
is using what we call a suit port.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.620
The idea of a suit port
is that you have this plate

27:30.720 --> 27:33.460
that becomes your pressure seal
between the vehicle

27:33.560 --> 27:35.940
and your suit,
so when you're not using the suit,

27:36.040 --> 27:37.780
it stays outside the entire time.

27:37.880 --> 27:41.980
It is physically attached to the vehicle so
you can come in and out of your space suit

27:42.080 --> 27:44.260
without ever having to physically

27:44.360 --> 27:47.540
go into an air lock like we do today.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.260
Welcome home, Richard.
How'd the suit feel?

27:49.360 --> 27:50.980
Feels good.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.082
Outstanding. Strong work out there.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.860
Driving a space
exploration vehicle on dry land

28:00.960 --> 28:04.169
is great training for deep-space
missions of the future.

28:08.640 --> 28:12.167
But driving a mini-sub
was even more exacting.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.411
No, there are no liquid oceans on Mars,

28:31.520 --> 28:33.980
but before setting out for the Red Planet,

28:34.080 --> 28:37.971
astronauts may make test
missions to nearby asteroids.

28:40.840 --> 28:45.380
A mini-sub resembles the kind of craft
we will use to explore asteroids,

28:45.480 --> 28:48.450
and the ocean matches
the zero gravity of space.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.260
This NEEMO 16 mission marks

29:01.360 --> 29:04.340
the 16th time NASA has trained
at the Aquarius lab,

29:04.440 --> 29:08.722
which is anchored 60 feet underwater,
off Key Largo in Florida.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.420
NASA aquanauts live in the lab
for up to two weeks

29:27.520 --> 29:29.522
without coming to the surface.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.220
This allows us to work the entire day

29:39.320 --> 29:43.402
and only decompress once
at the end of the mission.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.220
Any mistakes here
can have real consequences,

29:51.320 --> 29:54.529
exactly as in deep, inhospitable space.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.500
Since asteroids appear
to have changed very little

30:05.600 --> 30:07.420
since they first formed,

30:07.520 --> 30:12.003
they could tell us a lot
about our early solar system.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.763
Ultimately, we may develop
space tools to capture

30:21.880 --> 30:26.124
and reposition a small asteroid
to orbit our moon.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.140
This would allow for easier study,

30:30.240 --> 30:33.540
and also develop our ability
to deflect a larger asteroid

30:33.640 --> 30:35.961
that was on a collision course with Earth.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.760
This Olympus inflatable habitat,

31:02.880 --> 31:05.340
designed by Bigelow Aerospace,

31:05.440 --> 31:08.340
is a look at the future
of living in space.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.500
Jay, this is amazing. How big is that?

31:10.600 --> 31:12.340
Thanks. Yeah, it's really big.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.260
It's about 2,250 cubic meters
interior volume, which is

31:15.360 --> 31:17.860
a little over twice the size
of the International Space Station.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.260
And it looks like it's, like,
40 feet tall or somethin'.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.700
Yeah, it's probably 45 or 50.
It's really big.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.020
Once you get into space,
you just inflate it with air?

31:25.120 --> 31:28.860
Right, we bring up huge compressed air
tanks that bring up large volumes of air.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.620
Um, this expands out so the
inside is about 16 meters

31:31.720 --> 31:34.326
in diameter, and the outside's
a lot bigger than that.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.700
It's surprising that an inflatable habitat

31:43.800 --> 31:47.460
can protect its crew against
micrometeorites and radiation,

31:47.560 --> 31:50.245
but that's what tests have shown.

31:51.280 --> 31:55.220
The immense volume of Olympus
will provide ample work areas

31:55.320 --> 31:59.325
as well as living space
to help maintain crew morale.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.660
Supply craft to provide food, fuel,

32:04.760 --> 32:08.340
and radiation-protective living
space will be landed on Mars

32:08.440 --> 32:12.180
well before the first human
expedition is launched.

32:12.280 --> 32:15.580
We don't know exactly what all
the spacecraft will look like,

32:15.680 --> 32:18.331
but concepts are under active development.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.460
Our infatuation with space exploration

32:23.560 --> 32:27.360
is as limitless as space itself.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.644
Without the shuttle, there would be
no International Space Station,

32:31.760 --> 32:36.100
the vital test bed for a future
human expedition to Mars.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.100
And that mission is closer
than you might imagine.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.620
NASA projects we will get
to Mars in the 2030s.

32:44.720 --> 32:49.900
In other words, within the career
of today's young astronauts.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.500
So any of these movies that you see where
people survive even for 20 seconds...

32:53.600 --> 32:55.300
Why go to Mars?

32:55.400 --> 32:58.847
Why not just send more and more
sophisticated robotic vehicles?

32:59.280 --> 33:01.820
I think to explore beyond what is known

33:01.920 --> 33:05.140
is simply at the core of our DNA.

33:05.240 --> 33:09.340
And only a human mission
can tell us definitively

33:09.440 --> 33:13.968
if we can survive and establish
future settlements on Mars.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.980
Astronauts exploring the planet may notice

33:29.080 --> 33:31.300
and learn things robots could not,

33:31.400 --> 33:35.488
things that could help take us
to the next frontiers beyond Mars.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.881
Every 26 months,
there is an optimal window

33:46.000 --> 33:48.810
for launching spacecraft to Mars.

33:48.920 --> 33:52.220
But even using the planets'
orbits to shorten distance

33:52.320 --> 33:55.300
and increase speed, with
currently planned propulsion,

33:55.400 --> 33:59.060
the trip to and from Mars
will take six months...

33:59.160 --> 34:01.220
each way.

34:15.760 --> 34:19.500
Someday, even more exotic plasma
or fusion propulsion

34:19.600 --> 34:21.900
could shorten the journey.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.846
But the first explorers to Mars
will not have that luxury.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.739
Orion can transport up to six passengers,

34:35.840 --> 34:37.780
but for a first trip to Mars,

34:37.880 --> 34:40.281
it would likely carry no more than four.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.260
While going to and from the Red Planet,

34:46.360 --> 34:48.739
Orion and the inflatable habitat

34:48.840 --> 34:51.860
will be the astronauts' life
support home for flight control,

34:51.960 --> 34:56.204
science, and that all-important
physical exercise.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.140
Going to Mars...

35:19.240 --> 35:21.980
getting there, working there,
coming back...

35:22.080 --> 35:24.300
will take nearly three years.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.500
I wonder how that will feel,

35:26.600 --> 35:31.242
to be away from home and friends
and family for so long.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.460
There is no 911 in space.

35:52.560 --> 35:56.300
When Orion nears Mars,
the spacecraft is two years away

35:56.400 --> 35:58.980
from any possibility of help from Earth.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.180
Even radio communications
will take 40 minutes

36:02.280 --> 36:04.180
to send and receive,

36:04.280 --> 36:07.540
so any equipment failures
or other emergencies

36:07.640 --> 36:10.291
must be solved by the crew alone.

36:16.720 --> 36:20.122
Nearly four decades
of robotic exploration on Mars

36:20.240 --> 36:23.244
has blazed a path for humans to follow...

36:24.480 --> 36:27.290
...craft like Pathfinder and Curiosity.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.090
Maybe I'll get to kick the dust
off their tires.

37:33.360 --> 37:37.220
Though it will be incredibly
exciting to land on Mars,

37:37.320 --> 37:41.060
our ongoing training
in sophisticated simulator labs

37:41.160 --> 37:45.245
means it won't feel entirely
unfamiliar when we get there.

37:50.400 --> 37:54.300
Later explorers to Mars might
travel hundreds of kilometers

37:54.400 --> 37:59.003
to mine their own water and hydrogen to
make fuel for their return to Earth.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.723
But first visitors
will have their hands full

38:02.840 --> 38:07.767
making the discoveries that only
a human mission can accomplish.

38:18.320 --> 38:22.060
I don't know if I'll ever get
to walk and work on Mars,

38:22.160 --> 38:25.300
but I may already know
some of those who will.

38:25.400 --> 38:29.767
Someone who dreams of it, just like me.

38:43.520 --> 38:47.860
Humankind has forever
been drawn toward the unknown,

38:47.960 --> 38:50.260
by the simple innate conviction

38:50.360 --> 38:53.620
that, to see the long-hidden
side of the mountain,

38:53.720 --> 38:58.100
to brush the infinite depth
of the sea, might reveal

38:58.200 --> 39:01.204
where we come from and who we are.

39:03.880 --> 39:07.460
When humans do touch and explore Mars,

39:07.560 --> 39:11.326
it will be among the greatest
achievements in history.

39:16.160 --> 39:19.700
But even that won't be enough.

39:19.800 --> 39:24.380
We are the species that explores.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.820
We will fashion new vessels

39:26.920 --> 39:29.651
to carry us still deeper into space,

39:29.760 --> 39:32.820
venturing from our life-giving home

39:32.920 --> 39:35.820
to uncover the secrets of the cosmos

39:35.920 --> 39:40.687
and our own unimagined possibilities.
