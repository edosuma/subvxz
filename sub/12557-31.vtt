THE BEGINNING.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.949
THE BEGINNING.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.372
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT THE OPERATION.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.836
YES, PLEASE.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.080

07:36.414 --> 07:38.371
IT'S LIKE
A MIRACLE.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.699
MARIE, MAYBE
IT'S A LITTLE...

07:40.794 --> 07:42.205
TOO MUCH LIKE
A MIRACLE.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.535
YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE...

07:43.630 --> 07:44.665
JUST THE THOUGHT
OF IT...

07:44.756 --> 07:46.497
YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW,

07:46.591 --> 07:48.252
IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL. I

08:00.397 --> 08:02.229
FROM THE BE...

08:02.315 --> 08:05.148
LISTEN, I'M GONNA
ASK YOU A QUESTION NOW.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.899
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN STAND ME

08:08.989 --> 08:11.822
FOR A... MAYBE
FOR ANOTHER CENTURY?

08:11.908 --> 08:14.024
FOR A CENTURY?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.235
FOR TEN CENTURIES!

08:16.329 --> 08:18.161
TILL DEATH DO US
PART, DARLING.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.331
WELL, NOW,
HAVE WE CHOSEN?

08:21.376 --> 08:22.537
YES, MR. VANCE,
WE'VE CHOSEN.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.038
RIGHT HERE,
THESE TWO--

08:24.129 --> 08:25.665
THESE YOUNG
ONES HERE.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.917
EXCELLENT CHOICE--
TWO OF OUR FINEST.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.373
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THEY'RE ALL READY TO GO.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.083
WE COULD
BEGIN ANYTIME.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.712
HOW ABOUT
TOMORROW MORNING?

08:32.804 --> 08:35.044
TOMORROW
MORNING!

08:35.140 --> 08:37.756
HOW ABOUT lF...?

08:37.851 --> 08:40.092
I AM AN INCREDIBLY
BAD SALESMAN.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.269
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT GUARANTEES.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.190
YOU CAN HA\/E THE TRANSFORMATION
FOR ONE VVEEK ON APPROVAL.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.272
<i>IF YOU'RE
NOT SATISFIED,</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:51.444
<i>WE EXHUME
YOUR OLD BODIES.</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:53.738
FOR A ONE-WEEK PERIOD,
THEY REMAIN INTACT,

08:53.825 --> 08:55.691
SHOULD YOU DECIDE...

08:55.785 --> 08:58.743
BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOVV
INFREQUENTLY THAT OCCURS.

08:58.830 --> 09:02.289
<i>WE'VE HAD BETTER THAN
98% SATISFACTION</i>

09:02.375 --> 09:04.366
<i>IN THE 12 YEARS THAT WE
HAVE BEEN OPERATING.</i>

09:04.419 --> 09:07.707
UH... EXCUSE ME, MR. VANCE,
HOVV MUCH VVOULD IT COST?

09:07.797 --> 09:10.630
WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS THAT
IN MY OFFICE, MR. HOLT?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.549
NO, LET'S FIND
OUT RIGHT NOW.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.172
HOW MUCH WOULD
IT COST, SIR?

09:15.263 --> 09:19.382
VVELL, THE ENTIRE
PROCEDURE, $5,000 PER BODY.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.266
<i>FOR YOU AND
MRS. HOLT,</i>

09:21.352 --> 09:22.478
<i>IT WOULD BE...</i>

09:22.562 --> 09:24.428
$10,000?

09:24.522 --> 09:25.933
<i>BUT PRORATING
IT, MR. HOLT,</i>

09:26.024 --> 09:27.640
<i>THAT IS,
BY FIGURING IT</i>

09:27.734 --> 09:29.600
ON THE BASIS
OF COST PER YEAR,

09:29.694 --> 09:31.981
I MIGHT SAY IT'S
RIDICULOUSLY LOW.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.655
I MEAN, $5,000 PER 100
YEARS OF LIFESPAN?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.823
YOU MUST SEE IT
FOR YOURSELVES.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.821
IT'S A VERY
ECONOMICAL FIGURE.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.778
MR. VANCE,
HERE WE ARE.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.454
HERE ARE $5,000.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.326
<i>NOW, THAT'S ALL WE'VE
GOT-- THESE $5,000.</i>

09:44.417 --> 09:46.283
NOW, WE COULD MAKE
A DOWN PAYMENT

09:46.377 --> 09:47.754
WITH THIS AND
CHARGE THE REST?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.248
AFTER ALL,
I'LL BE YOUNG AGAIN,

09:49.297 --> 09:50.913
AND YOU SAID
I COULD WORK AGAIN.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.168
YOU COULD TAKE IT
OUT OF MY WEEKLY SALARY.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.795
MR. HOLT, l-l'M SORRY

09:54.886 --> 09:57.298
BUT GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS PROHIBIT

09:57.388 --> 09:59.925
ANY EXTENSION
OF CREDIT.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.430
THE TRANSACTION
MUST BE IN CASH.
