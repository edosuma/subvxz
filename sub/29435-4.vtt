00:09.444 --> 00:12.055
WOMAN:
Welcome to Arlington
National Cemetery.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.752
Please line up
if you have a ticket

00:13.796 --> 00:15.972
for the 8:30 tour bus,
and remember to obey

00:16.016 --> 00:18.235
all signs asking for
silence and respect.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.020
Excuse me.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.631
Excuse me. What time
does the show start?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.067
This is a cemetery.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.634
We don't have shows.

00:25.677 --> 00:28.115
The guard thing
at the tomb.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.334
Sir, the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier

00:30.378 --> 00:32.989
is a monument dedicated to
the fallen service members

00:33.033 --> 00:34.643
who have not yet
been identified.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.079
The soldiers
who stand watch are there

00:36.123 --> 00:39.213
to honor them,
not entertain you.Okay.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.128
And when does it start?

00:42.172 --> 00:44.000
Sir, the guard changes
every half hour.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.698
Now, please, get back in line.Oh, wow.

00:46.742 --> 00:49.092
[horse neighing]Hold on, let me just take
a video of this parade.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.094
Sir, this is not Disneyland.[people chattering excitedly]

00:51.138 --> 00:53.401
WOMAN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:56.404 --> 00:58.797
Oh. Everyone,
stay back.

00:58.841 --> 00:59.755
What the hell?

01:06.153 --> 01:07.197
Easy, now.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.199
Easy. Hey.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.245
Easy. Easy.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.595
Uh, ma'am? We
got a problem.

01:13.638 --> 01:17.077
I know. And it's got four legs,
and it's looking right at me.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.600
No.Good boy.

01:18.643 --> 01:21.168
Easy. Easy, now.This problem's... human.

01:22.821 --> 01:25.172
Oh, my God.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.960
â™ª

01:59.249 --> 02:02.209
Evidence number 4556.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.427
Two computer hard drives.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.037
That's 4556.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.910
Got 'em.
Okay, which pile--

02:07.953 --> 02:09.999
long-term storage
or destruction?

02:10.042 --> 02:11.174
Destruction.

02:11.218 --> 02:14.003
Nick, I'm still waiting on 2666.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.135
Yeah, yeah.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.398
[sighs]
This is not fair.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.748
Yeah, tell me about it.
I could totally have re-used

02:19.791 --> 02:21.184
these hard drives in my rack.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.752
No, not that. This.
Punishment.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.754
Well, lying about Ziva was bad.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.321
Director said there'd
be consequences.

02:27.364 --> 02:30.150
Yeah, I get that,
but these jumpsuits

02:30.193 --> 02:31.194
make it seem like

02:31.238 --> 02:32.935
we're in prison,

02:32.978 --> 02:34.197
and we're not even allowed
cell phones down here,

02:34.241 --> 02:36.373
which is cruel and unusual.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.288
Well, it's about to get
more unusual.

02:38.332 --> 02:41.204
I just found number 2666

02:41.248 --> 02:43.859
Mm.
"Doll at a crime scene."

02:43.902 --> 02:46.557
Double homicide.

02:46.601 --> 02:49.995
DOLL:
I love you and I'm sorry.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.171
Why is it apologizing?

02:51.214 --> 02:52.215
For killing two people.Oh.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.869
Destruction pile, please.

02:53.912 --> 02:57.351
Storage, where it will clearly
haunt us for the next six days.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.353
Six days away from
the outside world.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.093
I mean, who knows what else
we're missing out there?

03:01.137 --> 03:03.183
Yeah, what if they announce
another Marvel movie?

03:03.226 --> 03:05.228
Maybe a nuclear bomb went off.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.665
Maybe we're dead,
and this is hell.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.102
Only if you break the rules.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.713
No cell phones.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.454
Director Vance
made it very clear.

03:13.497 --> 03:16.674
As lead evidence technician,
I am to immediately

03:16.718 --> 03:18.894
report any
misconduct.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.679
Has there been any misconduct?

03:21.723 --> 03:22.767
No misconduct, we promise.Super.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.160
Fantastic, yeah.This is so much fun.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.683
Because as much as I love
being bossed around

03:25.727 --> 03:27.511
by field agents
on a daily basis,

03:27.555 --> 03:31.907
turns out bossing them around
is even better.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.996
Also, it, uh...

03:34.039 --> 03:35.258
gets lonely down here.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.741
No windows can...

03:39.784 --> 03:42.439
do funny things to a man.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.093
[clears throat]

03:44.136 --> 03:45.486
I brought
more evidence.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.271
Ah.[grunts]

03:48.315 --> 03:50.099
Cell phones.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.144
NICK: Stolen phones.TERRY: Mm-hmm.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.451
From a stolen car.Stolen by Gibbs and Ziva.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.366
The case that brought me
my new best friends.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.282
All right, Terry, we're good.
All right, we're good.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.459
Strong biceps you got there.
You do keto?

04:02.503 --> 04:06.420
Hey, these are prepaid,
ready for use by people.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.987
Uh, sorry, those are slated
for immediate destruction.

04:09.031 --> 04:12.774
So I guess the, uh, outside
world's just gonna have to wait.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.298
No, it won't.Boss, is there a nuclear war?

04:15.342 --> 04:16.299
Or a dead body?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.909
Body-ish.DOLL: Let's go play.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.998
Get that away from me.
Let's go.

04:20.042 --> 04:23.567
Agent Gibbs, did the director
approve this furlough?

04:23.611 --> 04:26.004
This punishment
isn't over!

04:26.048 --> 04:28.093
Arlington PD's on the horn.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.269
They want to know
if we need help.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.009
Help?
We're choking on help.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.403
I got five agencies
arguing about jurisdiction.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.710
So that's a...No. We do not need

04:35.753 --> 04:37.320
any more people
wandering around here

04:37.364 --> 04:38.408
with letters on their back.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.671
NCIS.
Special Agent Gibbs.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.064
McGee, Bishop, Torres.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.457
Who called NCIS?

04:43.500 --> 04:44.936
Arlington National
Cemetery is controlled

04:44.980 --> 04:46.590
by the Department of the Army.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.288
CID has jurisdiction.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.593
Well, if somebody
has jurisdiction,

04:49.637 --> 04:51.029
they're clearly not
taking it.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.684
I got everyone from
base police to Animal Control

04:53.728 --> 04:56.948
chomping at the bit, literally.
I mean, did you hear?

04:56.992 --> 04:58.602
There's a horse.With six feet.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.517
Exactly.
It's a mess, sir.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.737
NCIS will only make it worse.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.261
We're here to make it better.Ha! How?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.046
You see that guy right there?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.353
Harry Potter?

05:10.397 --> 05:13.051
Yeah, we, uh...

05:13.095 --> 05:14.401
we call him the chosen one.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.968
He is our NCIS M.E.Your point?

05:17.012 --> 05:19.623
First M.E. on the scene
controls the scene.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.279
Is that true?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.324
JIMMY:
Hey.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.456
Did he call me
the chosen one?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.415
I gave him five bucks
to call me the chosen one.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.593
Based on the shape

05:32.636 --> 05:34.638
of the arches
and the thick hair,

05:34.682 --> 05:38.163
I'd say that these feet belonged
to a late-aged male.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.251
Time of removal?

05:39.295 --> 05:41.384
Tissue, color and condition
suggest

05:41.428 --> 05:43.081
maybe the last 24 hours.

05:43.125 --> 05:46.650
Too bad AFIT only works
for fingerprints, huh?

05:46.694 --> 05:49.784
Finding the owner could be
quite challenging.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.438
What are those-- burns?

05:51.481 --> 05:53.570
Look more like ulcers.Bad ones.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.442
Yeah, these sores
are pretty deep.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.619
Okay, why don't you just
save the details for autopsy.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.534
Fear of, uh,
irregular hole patterns

06:00.577 --> 06:01.665
is called trypophobia.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.841
It's quite real.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.061
Some people even vomit, McGee.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.759
Anything
on the horse?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.282
Uh, no ID.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.372
It's not talking,
either.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.722
He. And Animal Control
has no idea where

06:14.765 --> 06:16.680
he came from--
just a random horse,

06:16.724 --> 06:18.769
wandering the streets.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.555
A riderless horse
is a funeral tradition.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.383
We are
at the entrance of

06:23.426 --> 06:24.384
Arlington National Cemetery.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.646
Doesn't seem random.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.431
Neither is this.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.086
Someone left us
a message.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.914
D. Holtzman.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.133
U.S. Marine Corps.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.571
I guess this is an NCIS
crime scene after all.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.094
All right,
so what's the crime--

06:39.137 --> 06:40.704
desecration or murder?[vehicle doors opening]

06:40.748 --> 06:42.532
Good question.WOMAN: Okay, guys,

06:42.576 --> 06:44.447
let's set up, uh, over here.Looks like we're not
the only ones asking.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.580
[indistinct chatter]McGEE: Just what we need:
media attention.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.191
CAMERAMAN:
Let's get a wide shot.WOMAN: Set up over here.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.714
[helicopter blades whirring][indistinct chatter]

06:50.758 --> 06:53.717
WOMAN:
Sir, does NCIS
have any comment?

07:04.249 --> 07:05.555
1.2 million likes.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.688
This story's
definitely blowing up.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.691
McGEE:
Riderless horse and severed feet
are definitely Insta-friendly.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.432
Whatever the hell that means.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.043
Update.
Let's go.

07:15.086 --> 07:18.089
Well, a riderless horse
carrying empty boots

07:18.133 --> 07:20.570
is a military symbol
honoring the dead.

07:20.614 --> 07:23.486
President Kennedy had one.
Reagan, Lincoln.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.445
And now Marine Sergeant
David Holtzman.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.404
Who's he?Only thing in the system

07:28.448 --> 07:29.623
was his last service photo.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.190
Holtzman was honorably
discharged in 1979.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.062
Yeah, and?And that's well before

07:34.105 --> 07:36.499
service records were digitized,
so for more we talk to

07:36.543 --> 07:38.153
Veterans Affairs, OIG.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.720
Okay, take Torres.
McGee.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.025
Find someone that knows
that Marine.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.723
Yeah, or find the rest of him.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.290
Boss, his address is
40 years old.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.467
Doesn't even exist anymore.
How we gonna find him?

07:47.510 --> 07:50.252
Use the Insta thing.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.427
That's what it's for, right?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.473
You mean post his service photo,

07:53.516 --> 07:56.432
see if anyone recognizes him?

07:56.476 --> 08:00.218
Boss, that is actually
the perfect use of social media.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.221
What about, uh,
Vance's punishment?

08:03.265 --> 08:05.136
Terry's still expecting us
downstairs.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.660
Case first.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.183
Yes.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.018
Feet are...

08:17.061 --> 08:19.542
highly symbolic.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.413
Jesus washed them
to show humility,

08:21.457 --> 08:24.547
drug cartels cut them off
to intimidate.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.028
And then, of course,
there are foot fetishes.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.159
GIBBS:
This about a fetish, Doc?

08:28.203 --> 08:29.683
I can't say for sure.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.599
What I can say is that
these size nine and a half feet

08:32.642 --> 08:35.297
belong to an adult male matching
Sergeant Holtzman's age.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.038
Blade slipped while cutting.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.343
Yeah, more than once.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.302
Which means that you
and whoever did this

08:40.345 --> 08:41.695
have something in common.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.046
Hand tools.

08:45.089 --> 08:48.136
I mean, obviously, he's not
as good as you are, right?

08:48.179 --> 08:50.442
Bow saw.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.227
I can't say for sure.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.577
I'm certain that
it wasn't electric.

08:54.621 --> 08:58.059
So, cutting through
the sergeant's lower tibia,

08:58.102 --> 09:01.149
fibula, was labor-intensive.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.803
Hard work.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.326
Was he alive?

09:04.369 --> 09:06.676
When his feet were removed?
Uh, uh, I...

09:06.720 --> 09:08.765
can't say for sure.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.288
What can you say?

09:10.332 --> 09:11.376
[doors open]

09:11.420 --> 09:12.769
Kasie's here.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.685
Oh.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.340
Why do I get the Gibbs glare?
I just got here.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.298
Residual energy.
I'm sorry.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.344
I'm not. Go.

09:22.387 --> 09:25.477
As I'm sure Jimmy told you,
the foot sores are the result

09:25.521 --> 09:28.176
of poor circulation
due to severe diabetes.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.134
The sergeant's pancreas,
wherever it may be,

09:30.178 --> 09:32.310
could not properly
produce insulin.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.747
That can help us find him.It might.

09:33.790 --> 09:36.793
Blood work also showed traces
of SGLT2 inhibitors.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.490
He was being treated.Yep.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.189
So, if you want to find
the long-lost sergeant...[dialing]

09:41.232 --> 09:44.279
Go find his doctor.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.933
Bishop?

09:49.414 --> 09:51.329
Former Sergeant Holtzman
has been treated

09:51.373 --> 09:53.201
at several hospitals
in the V.A. system,

09:53.244 --> 09:54.898
but he hasn't been back
in two weeks.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.161
And we certainly haven't
amputated any body parts.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.380
It's all in that file.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.382
No recent photo, Dr. Bell?

10:00.425 --> 10:03.994
No. But we track all
medically relevant information,

10:04.038 --> 10:06.257
and then it's all in that file.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.738
Now, if you'll excuse me.

10:14.352 --> 10:15.615
Hey!

10:15.658 --> 10:16.833
This is private.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.313
Someone sawed off
Sergeant Holtzman's feet

10:18.356 --> 10:20.228
and we're trying to figure out
if he's still alive.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.621
You don't seem to care.

10:23.274 --> 10:26.408
It's been 52 hours
since my shift started.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.802
And a lot longer than that
since I had a social life

10:28.845 --> 10:32.066
or more than a can of olives
in my refrigerator.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.458
I care.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.765
Then... talk to us.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.288
I am.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.857
But everything I know
is truly in that file.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.467
I see so many patients,

10:42.511 --> 10:44.252
I only get to know them
as a chart.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.254
A number.

10:46.297 --> 10:49.257
Sergeant Holtzman is part of
the city's homeless population,

10:49.300 --> 10:51.346
people that nobody talks about.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.347
They're talking now.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.348
Good.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.829
This system is far from perfect.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.395
It needs attention.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.833
I-I already have six departments

10:59.876 --> 11:01.399
waiting on a funding bill

11:01.443 --> 11:03.271
that's been stuck in Congress
for months.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.881
Does the sergeant have family?

11:04.925 --> 11:06.796
No.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.886
And if a vet is left unclaimed,

11:09.930 --> 11:12.193
the body's cremated

11:12.236 --> 11:14.325
and the ashes
are put inside these boxes.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.417
Which I then put...

11:20.505 --> 11:22.986
...in here.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.949
This is what happens
when nobody talks about you.

11:28.992 --> 11:31.038
They're all homeless veterans?

11:32.648 --> 11:34.911
At least they'll be buried
in a military grave.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.391
With dignity.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.265
But I'd rather
care for these men and women

11:41.309 --> 11:43.746
while they're alive.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.487
So, please,

11:45.530 --> 11:48.403
find the sergeant.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.971
I suggest starting
with local encampments.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.367
[indistinct chatter]

12:02.069 --> 12:04.027
This place used to
be a metro hub.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.769
Now the locals now call it
the end of the line.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.466
Not exactly cheerful.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.120
Not a lot to be
cheerful about, McGee.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.470
Well, at least this camp
gets medical visits.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.864
The last three didn't.MAN:
If our homeless population

12:14.908 --> 12:18.085
can't go to the hospital,
the hospital must go to them.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.608
Great line.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.349
Let's record that again.
This time I'll say it.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.307
Ah. This podcast does
have listeners, right?

12:23.351 --> 12:26.658
[laughs] My social media reach
is over six million and growing.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.138
Hey. You work here?

12:29.270 --> 12:31.098
Federal agents.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.100
I'm a volunteer
for Mercy Point Mobile Care.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.492
Yeah, you recognize this man?

12:34.536 --> 12:36.886
He'd be older now,
by about 40 years.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.932
Our program helps
a lot of people, sir.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.411
Is there something wrong?

12:40.455 --> 12:42.762
Wait, wait. NCIS?

12:42.805 --> 12:45.112
You're trending in all those
creepy feet tweets.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.548
You showed up late
to the crime scene.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.942
That's not at all what happened.Let's talk about it.

12:48.985 --> 12:52.293
It'll be an exclusive story
on this episode of Truth Bomb.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.642
Wait, wait, I thought
we were truth bombing

12:53.685 --> 12:54.861
homeless care today.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.167
Please.Come on. NCIS is trending.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.735
We'll combine homeless issues
with government ineptitude.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.913
No comment.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.394
Big mistake.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.179
The truth will out.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.358
Just what the world needs, boss:
another podcast.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.012
Whatever that means.

13:16.056 --> 13:19.624
Hey.
Uh, did you say NCIS?

13:19.668 --> 13:21.496
Great.
You run a podcast, too?

13:21.539 --> 13:23.933
No.
I recognize your picture.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.456
It's Marine Sergeant
David Holtzman,

13:25.500 --> 13:28.155
just a lot younger, right?

13:28.198 --> 13:30.026
I'm Barney Williams, sir.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.593
Special Agents Gibbs and McGee.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.334
How do you know the sergeant?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.598
We live here.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.296
You know where he sleeps?

13:40.602 --> 13:43.648
Is Davey okay?

13:48.044 --> 13:50.830
I haven't seen the sergeant
since last night, sir.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.397
He doesn't get around too well.
And that was before.

13:53.441 --> 13:56.009
Damn.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.575
Who the hell is
chopping off feet?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.882
GIBBS:
Anybody report him missing?

13:59.926 --> 14:02.624
You know, people out here
come and go a lot.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.278
And not many have phones, sir.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.324
Not like him to
miss morning chow.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.460
You military?

14:13.591 --> 14:14.854
No, sir.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.164
Well, how we gonna
find my friend?

14:21.208 --> 14:23.384
Boss.
I got something.

14:28.737 --> 14:31.348
BARNEY:
Oh, man.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.655
Found him under
three layers of trash.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.179
Davey didn't
deserve this.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.794
Hold on.
Got another one.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.761
That's Norma Jean.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.068
McGEE:
That body still has feet.

15:03.511 --> 15:06.035
What the hell
is going on here?

15:14.696 --> 15:15.697
REPORTER: The capital's
homeless population

15:15.740 --> 15:16.959
is currently in a spotlight

15:17.003 --> 15:19.701
as federal authorities
hunt for a killer.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.529
Killer? Come on.
We haven't actually confirmed

15:21.572 --> 15:23.009
the cause of death.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.228
Working on it, Director.But you did ID the second body?

15:26.447 --> 15:27.491
Former Marine Staff Sergeant

15:27.535 --> 15:28.666
Norma Jean Pfeiffer.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.668
Discharged in '93.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.975
That's two Marines,
both homeless.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.238
It's not a good look for us
or the system.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.937
Or the victims.I'm told that there's
major public outcry,

15:37.980 --> 15:40.548
against veterans
slipping through cracks.Good.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.855
Leroy Jethro Gibbs agrees
with social media outrage?

15:44.769 --> 15:46.815
Gibbs, this case
and our involvement in it--

15:46.858 --> 15:47.947
it's everywhere.
That means

15:47.990 --> 15:48.904
cameras are gonna be rolling
everywhere.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.166
Well, then, good.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.646
They can watch us catch
this son of a bitch.

15:51.689 --> 15:52.777
Quickly and cleanly, I hope.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.518
Leon, I want my team
out of the basement.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.433
I'd never stand in the way
of an active investigation.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.262
However, your team
is very capable.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.873
They can find time for this case
and their extra workload.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.701
Punishments are meant
to be hard.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.660
Come on.For everyone.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.837
After all, kids learn bad habits
by watching their parents.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.977
[door closes]

16:18.020 --> 16:20.762
Now, hands are highly symbolic.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.894
Save it.
What do we know?

16:22.938 --> 16:24.418
Uh, Sergeant Holtzman died

16:24.461 --> 16:26.637
due to complications
from his diabetes.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.378
It was a heart attack.

16:28.422 --> 16:31.425
Natural causes.Yeah, desecration, not murder.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.994
However, Staff Sergeant Norma
Jean Pfeiffer's cause of death

16:35.037 --> 16:37.213
was blunt force trauma
to the back of the head,

16:37.257 --> 16:40.390
so we have desecration
and murder.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.392
Murder weapon?Uh, her head wound

16:42.436 --> 16:46.875
perfectly matches the corner
of this broken toaster here

16:46.918 --> 16:48.877
from a nearby junk pile.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.487
Not very practical.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.402
My guess is it's the first thing
the killer grabbed.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.796
Murder wasn't planned.Like I said,

16:54.839 --> 16:58.365
sawing through bone
takes time and effort.

16:58.408 --> 17:01.890
Maybe Norma Jean saw him

17:01.933 --> 17:05.198
sawing, and was
then... sawed?

17:05.241 --> 17:07.113
That's a lot of saws.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.726
It's also a lot of work.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.945
You think we're looking
for a madman?

17:13.989 --> 17:15.991
Or someone with purpose.What purpose?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.863
I mean, Gibbs, who
targets homeless veterans?

17:21.736 --> 17:23.259
BARNEY:
Norma Jean was an
ordnance specialist

17:23.303 --> 17:25.827
in the first Gulf War.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.612
20 years after Davey
served in Vietnam.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.267
Different decades,
similar stories.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.965
And you seem to have them
all written down there.

17:34.009 --> 17:37.317
Every vet I meet, I like to add
their story to my journal.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.840
Is it because
you're also a veteran?

17:41.016 --> 17:44.106
Hey, never lie to Gibbs.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.456
That man can smell
a fellow Marine.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.941
Lance Corporal
Bernard Williams, right?

17:52.984 --> 17:55.639
That was a long time ago.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.164
Uh, it was barely last year.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.427
How long you been
living on the streets?

18:00.470 --> 18:01.993
Not as long as Davey

18:02.037 --> 18:03.778
or Norma Jean.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.302
They're the ones
you should be talking about.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.912
They're proud vets.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.436
And you're not?

18:09.479 --> 18:11.960
Stop. Please.
It's not about me.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.920
A-And I said no
special treatment.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.053
I'm not eating this.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.446
Not unless you have
enough for everybody.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.840
And by everybody...I mean

18:22.884 --> 18:24.842
everybody living
at that bus stop.

18:24.886 --> 18:28.063
Vet, civilian-- everybody.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.458
You eat when the unit eats.

18:33.373 --> 18:34.896
You serve?

18:34.939 --> 18:36.985
Army.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.123
You got a minute?

18:44.166 --> 18:46.516
For your story.

18:50.738 --> 18:54.220
Per Terry's request, I have
collected backlogged evidence

18:54.263 --> 18:56.918
for immediate storage
and sorting.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.180
Whose side are you
on, anyway, huh?

18:58.224 --> 18:59.921
This is supposed to
be our lunch break.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.880
I guess that's what you get when
you lie to the director's face.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.100
Which I had nothing to do with!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.971
We know that.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.451
So does Vance.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.019
Does he?
Guilt by association.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.934
I shouldn't even
be talking to you right now.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.675
I'm not ending up
in that garage.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.546
Half-windows are better
than no windows.

19:16.590 --> 19:20.202
Actually, we were hoping
that you could give us a break.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.335
On the case.
Like, a major one

19:22.378 --> 19:24.337
that requires
immediate attention.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.035
From... [clears throat]
all of us.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.776
Yeah, 'cause we only got
about three and a half minutes,

19:28.819 --> 19:29.994
then we got to report
back to Terry.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.127
Kasie, help us.Fine. You're lucky

19:32.171 --> 19:33.650
I do have major breaks.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.478
While people can fall
through the cracks,

19:35.522 --> 19:37.088
horses do not.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.133
Yeah, they're too big.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.267
Horse humor.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.485
Like household pets,

19:42.529 --> 19:45.009
horses are often implanted
with microchips.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.837
To ID them if they get lost.

19:46.881 --> 19:47.969
And Animal Control found one?

19:48.012 --> 19:49.449
And sent me the data.Hmm.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.015
Meet No Sprinkles,

19:51.059 --> 19:53.061
a gelding who belongs
to Henry Hoss,

19:53.104 --> 19:55.411
a stable owner
who's being brought in.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.544
I'll go follow up.

19:58.936 --> 20:02.157
[grunts]
Kasie, any more breaks?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.072
Yeah, we only got
45 seconds left here.

20:04.115 --> 20:07.075
Yes. The V.A. is lying to me.
I think.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.425
I called them for Norma
Jean's medical records,

20:09.469 --> 20:11.035
but they said
the computers were down.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.428
Well, that's just typical
government infrastructure,

20:12.472 --> 20:13.690
not a lie.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.910
Except I've been
calling all day.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.955
Good enough for me. Let's go.McGEE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:17.999 --> 20:21.220
Hold on. Medical records do not
scream immediate attention.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.743
Terry doesn't know that.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.310
Okay.

20:24.353 --> 20:27.922
Remember, I don't
know you.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.402
[door opens]

20:29.445 --> 20:31.447
Hey. I miss it?

20:31.491 --> 20:33.275
Nope. Mr. Hoss seemed
angry to be here,

20:33.319 --> 20:35.973
so I thought I'd let him stew
in the hot seat a little longer.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.454
Case notes?Uh...

20:38.498 --> 20:40.282
Pages from
Barney's journal.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.416
Our millennial veteran.
What does he write about?

20:43.459 --> 20:45.287
Other vets. Their
time in the service.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.506
Their transition home.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.421
All beautifully written
in thoughtful detail

20:48.464 --> 20:50.031
and in very cheap ink.

20:50.074 --> 20:52.294
Yeah, it's hard to read
with all the smudges.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.079
So... what is his story?

20:55.123 --> 20:57.125
That's the thing.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.561
Barney's story
isn't in here,

20:58.605 --> 21:01.085
and he refuses
to talk about it.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.957
Even lied to Gibbs
about being a Marine.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.265
And you want to know why.Mm.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.875
Bishop. Let's go.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.835
BISHOP:
Your horse.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.273
Your murder.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.408
How dare you.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.062
I was Navy myself.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.369
Yes, sir.
Retired commander.

21:23.412 --> 21:26.459
Then you should know.
I could never kill, much less

21:26.502 --> 21:29.070
desecrate my own
brothers and sisters.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.202
It's bad enough
they're on the streets.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.814
It makes me sick.How sick?

21:35.859 --> 21:37.339
I board a lot of horses.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.558
I didn't notice

21:38.601 --> 21:41.387
No Sprinkles was missing
till NCIS called.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.258
Somebody must have
stole him last night.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.346
You seem pretty sure.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.826
The barn was still locked.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.263
So it had to be someone
with a key.Like you.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.270
You like hard work.Yes.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.099
I board a lot of horses
for a lot of owners.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.448
How many have keys to the barn?

21:59.492 --> 22:02.408
All of them.
You want a damn list?

22:08.501 --> 22:09.545
Yeah.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.506
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

22:13.549 --> 22:16.030
Happy now?

22:16.073 --> 22:19.338
I guess the network is down.And has been all day.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.687
Yet another department
that needs attention.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.297
It was nice
seeing you again,

22:22.341 --> 22:24.560
but my shift is
finally about to end.

22:24.604 --> 22:26.257
[clears throat]
Uh...

22:27.215 --> 22:28.259
What about the records?

22:28.303 --> 22:30.784
I showed you--
the system is down.

22:30.827 --> 22:33.395
Well, paper files existed
long before computers.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.266
There's been time
to pull those, right?

22:35.310 --> 22:36.224
[sighs]

22:36.267 --> 22:37.573
You're right.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.271
I should have done that.
I'm sorry.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.622
Well, it's okay.
You get busy, we understand.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.841
No.

22:44.885 --> 22:47.235
I'm scared.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.544
Look, the last thing
I want to do is complain

22:51.587 --> 22:53.110
about online trolls,

22:53.154 --> 22:55.069
but the V.A. has been getting
death threats since yesterday.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.419
From people who blame us
for killing veterans.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.203
Oh, this mentions you
by name.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.597
Someone found out my dad
is former Coast Guard

23:01.641 --> 23:02.598
and has diabetes.

23:02.642 --> 23:03.991
Like Sergeant Holtzman.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.427
Oh. I'm sorry.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.343
He's doing fine.
Except now people want to know

23:08.387 --> 23:11.259
why the V.A. can save him,
but not the homeless.

23:11.302 --> 23:12.303
Damn.

23:12.347 --> 23:13.827
Funny thing is,
I'm glad people

23:13.870 --> 23:15.176
are actually paying attention,

23:15.219 --> 23:17.134
but finger-pointing
doesn't help.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.441
Uh, actually, Doc...

23:19.485 --> 23:21.225
I think you dropped one.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.445
I assure you that wasn't me.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.883
I don't know who would be
so disrespectful...

23:28.102 --> 23:29.538
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

23:35.109 --> 23:37.372
More finger-pointing.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.902
TORRES:
The hands belong to our
murdered staff sergeant.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.513
News already has the story

23:47.556 --> 23:49.863
and they're now
calling our killer

23:49.906 --> 23:51.517
the Military Mangler,

23:51.560 --> 23:53.867
wondering which body parts
will be found next.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.696
It's not about body parts,
it's about messaging.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.306
Someone's trying
to say something.

23:58.349 --> 23:59.873
Loud and clear.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.962
First, a riderless horse
in a cemetery.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.138
Now pointing
fingers in a morgue.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.879
Recognition and blame.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.229
Our killer wants vets honored,

24:08.272 --> 24:10.753
but not forgotten
about in a cabinet?

24:10.797 --> 24:13.016
It seems a little on the nose.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.279
Yeah, but it works.McGEE: Well, especially
for the media.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.585
All anyone's
talking about right now

24:16.629 --> 24:17.760
is the treatment of veterans.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.849
BISHOP:
The story's everywhere.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.068
Okay, so who benefits?

24:21.111 --> 24:23.810
From killing vets
or blaming the system?

24:23.853 --> 24:25.768
All of it.
I want a motive.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.466
How about anger?

24:27.509 --> 24:28.858
What, Jack, you got something?

24:28.902 --> 24:30.860
Maybe. But I could
use a second opinion.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.819
McGEE:
We'll scrub through visitor logs

24:32.862 --> 24:34.255
and security footage
from the V.A.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.431
No, no.
Not in here, you won't.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.085
TERRY:
It is awfully quiet

24:38.128 --> 24:41.436
downstairs. And you did
miss your lunchtime quota.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.917
Terry.
Seriously, man?

24:43.960 --> 24:46.441
I believe you've been
ordered to multitask.

24:48.269 --> 24:49.966
Yeah.

24:51.838 --> 24:54.014
[sighs]

24:58.322 --> 25:01.282
GIBBS:
Barney.

25:01.325 --> 25:02.675
You think he's angry.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.068
I think he's interesting.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.898
Here.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.555
He, uh, he grew up
with a single mom.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.558
She worked multiple jobs
to keep food on the table,

25:16.602 --> 25:17.951
and he joined the
Marines to change that.

25:17.994 --> 25:20.606
Well, he's got commendations.
Medals.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.565
By all accounts,
he was a great Marine.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.088
He loved serving.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.788
So?

25:30.050 --> 25:32.400
Why lie, Jack?I don't know.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.837
But while he was
serving in Afghanistan,

25:34.881 --> 25:36.883
his mother got sick.
Pancreatic cancer.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.841
And Barney had to take an
emergency leave

25:38.885 --> 25:40.147
to come home
and take care of her.

25:40.190 --> 25:43.324
Family first.Right.
But unfortunately,

25:43.367 --> 25:45.326
his mom died,
like, four months later.

25:45.369 --> 25:48.851
But not until Barney
spent everything they had

25:48.895 --> 25:50.897
on her medical care,
leaving him with nothing.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.813
And nobody.

25:53.856 --> 25:57.033
He has every reason
to be angry at the world

25:57.077 --> 25:58.513
and the system.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.298
Jack, if you think he did this,
let's bring him in here.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.301
I don't think he did it.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.870
But?

26:08.915 --> 26:11.874
But only because
I kind of like the kid.

26:11.918 --> 26:14.268
Otherwise, yes, he is
a potential suspect.

26:14.311 --> 26:17.488
He is clearly struggling
with something, Gibbs.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.539
Barney tell you
where he sleeps,

26:24.583 --> 26:26.759
or are we just
knocking on flaps here?Knocking.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.588
MAN:
Hey! Hey. Over here.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.459
NCIS.
There you are.

26:31.502 --> 26:32.939
Is there a problem, sir?

26:32.982 --> 26:35.724
Uh... yes.
Someone else was attacked.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.030
Isn't that why you're here?

26:37.073 --> 26:38.684
We're here for
Barney Williams.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.078
He was the one who was attacked.

26:42.122 --> 26:45.125
He's in mobile
care now.

26:49.912 --> 26:52.480
Barney.

26:52.523 --> 26:53.612
You okay?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.396
Told you I wasn't
a Marine anymore.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.528
Marine would never
let themselves get jumped

26:57.572 --> 26:59.095
while taking a leak.I'm calling an ambulance.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.357
No.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.752
I said no special treatment.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.667
You got me in enough trouble.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.060
What?

27:07.103 --> 27:09.584
Whoever did this
knows I've been talking to NCIS.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.194
They must think
I know something.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.500
Why?

27:12.543 --> 27:14.328
Because they took it.

27:16.417 --> 27:17.418
Your journal?

27:18.462 --> 27:20.508
But you read it, Agent Sloane.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.118
There was nothing in there
about the case.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.642
No.
Not that we know of.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.515
Listen, we got to get
you out of here.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.083
No.
I live here.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.519
Well, you're
not staying.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.086
Yes.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.088
I am.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.959
Well, then,
you're not staying alone.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.395
Good idea, Gibbs.

27:38.439 --> 27:41.007
Wait, what's a good idea?

27:41.050 --> 27:42.399
Standing watch.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.054
No.
I said no special treatment.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.448
Hey, it's for...
[clears throat]

27:48.841 --> 27:50.712
For the whole camp.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.717
You take first watch,
I'll take second.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.110
Okay.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.810
McGEE:
Well, there is no camera
that clearly shows

28:01.854 --> 28:03.464
who entered the V.A. morgue.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.467
Six hours of work
for a dead end.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.774
[exhales]
Nowhere.

28:08.817 --> 28:11.167
You have anything
to add, edgelord?

28:11.211 --> 28:14.214
My cell use is case-related,
and what do you want me to say?

28:14.257 --> 28:17.304
DOLL:
I love you and I'm sorry.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.393
I didn't touch anything.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.830
Neither did I, Agent Torres.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.223
So...

28:23.266 --> 28:25.747
I hope you're looking up
an exorcist, Agent Bishop.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.141
Actually, a V.A. website, sir.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.926
Looking up what they
offer, which is a lot.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.145
I'm aware.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.276
Well, not everybody
is, Director.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.582
I mean, mostly because
you need e-mail

28:34.625 --> 28:36.018
or a phone number to sign up.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.368
Cell phones are no longer
luxury items.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.543
Oh, they're
necessities.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.807
I mean, even Gibbs
carries one around.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.547
Yeah, and he's
a repeat technophobe

28:43.591 --> 28:44.810
and known troglodyte.

28:44.853 --> 28:47.247
Yeah. Yeah, he's also a...

28:47.290 --> 28:49.597
what he said.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.035
So your excuse
for insubordination

28:53.079 --> 28:54.471
is case-related.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.214
That's what I thought.

28:58.258 --> 29:01.217
Start fresh tomorrow.
Go home.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.142
Spear?

29:16.537 --> 29:17.799
Toothpick.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.283
You should get some sleep.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.676
Rather be writing in my journal.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.723
Usually helps me pass the time.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.899
Makes me feel a little better.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.339
Start writing.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.652
Start talking.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.134
I'm not writing my story.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.179
"Once a Marine,
always a Marine."

29:52.399 --> 29:56.011
Not if you don't complete
your mission, sir.

30:03.627 --> 30:07.327
I came home
to take care of my mom.

30:07.370 --> 30:11.157
I took emergency leave knowing
my fire team was headed

30:11.200 --> 30:13.899
towards a major hot spot
in Helmand province.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.596
MAN:
We're under fire! [shouting] [gunfire]

30:15.639 --> 30:17.337
Not everybody came back.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.382
[shouting, gunfire continuing]

30:22.168 --> 30:24.648
Couldn't save my mom.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.607
Couldn't save my team.

30:26.650 --> 30:30.654
I should've died
with my brothers back there.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.787
It's not your fault.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.224
[scoffs]
Here we go.

30:35.268 --> 30:38.271
You want to come out here
on guard duty, fine.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.316
But don't you sit there
and tell me

30:40.360 --> 30:42.623
you know what it's like
to lose everything,

30:42.666 --> 30:44.625
and to feel like nothing.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.235
[scoffs quietly]

30:47.802 --> 30:50.631
To put a gun to your head
and...

30:50.674 --> 30:52.415
just end it all.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.811
I did that.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.207
What?
Which part?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.426
All of it, when I came back.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.517
Damn. Why?

31:12.479 --> 31:14.437
So how come you're still alive?

31:14.481 --> 31:17.266
A friend helped me
realize something.

31:17.310 --> 31:21.227
What-- that life is beautiful?

31:22.402 --> 31:25.231
That I deserved to exist.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.931
[clattering]MAN: Hey, what are you doing?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.280
[dog barking]

31:32.586 --> 31:34.457
Get away
from my tent!

31:34.501 --> 31:35.763
[grunting]

31:35.806 --> 31:36.982
Hey!

31:37.025 --> 31:38.200
Stop!

31:38.244 --> 31:39.985
MAN:
Hey! Stop him!

31:48.123 --> 31:51.126
You want me?
Here I am.

31:54.129 --> 31:55.478
[grunting]

31:55.522 --> 31:56.740
WOMAN:
Get off me!

31:56.784 --> 31:58.090
Federal agent.
Don't move.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.526
Oh, my God.
I'm unarmed.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.310
The cop is now pointing
his gun into my face.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.225
If I die, it was all
in the name of Truth.

32:03.269 --> 32:04.313
Enough.

32:04.357 --> 32:05.401
What are you doing?

32:05.445 --> 32:06.533
Truth Bombing.

32:06.576 --> 32:07.708
In the middle
of the night?

32:07.751 --> 32:09.666
It's called atmosphere.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.452
But then I heard
you two talking about...

32:12.495 --> 32:14.628
about suicide and stuff.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.676
That was powerful.
For real.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.854
That story should
really be out there.

32:23.898 --> 32:25.900
And that's why you
stole my journal?

32:25.944 --> 32:28.120
I'm a truth teller,
not a criminal.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.078
You have an alibi?Yeah.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.863
It's time, date and GPS-stamped
audio files.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.303
[recorder beeps]

32:37.346 --> 32:39.131
Wait, you're taking that?
For real?

32:39.174 --> 32:40.393
For real.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.704
So this was a waste of time.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.490
Good work, Marine.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.492
Just stop.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.537
That story's over.

32:55.669 --> 32:58.150
I'm not
a Marine anymore.

33:04.460 --> 33:05.984
Drink it in, people--

33:06.027 --> 33:08.595
the phones, the sun,
the outside world--

33:08.638 --> 33:10.510
before we are doomed
to spend more time

33:10.553 --> 33:11.815
with my new best friend, Terry.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.774
You two are friends now?

33:13.817 --> 33:15.819
No.
But we will be.

33:15.863 --> 33:18.518
The man is a protein genius.

33:18.561 --> 33:19.910
Look what I found on
the floor last night.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.738
It's his diet plan.

33:21.782 --> 33:22.652
McGEE:
Okay, and now
you want him

33:22.696 --> 33:24.654
to be your life coach?

33:24.698 --> 33:26.743
Dietary Sherpa.Shh.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.877
I thought we were watching
this emergency vote in Congress.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.792
Not exactly Game of Thrones.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.750
Spoiler alert: it just passed.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.448
Unanimously, too.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.754
This is important why?This is

33:37.798 --> 33:39.278
the funding bill
for veteran care.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.584
They increased spending
all around.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.326
Including a very large chunk
to Veterans Affairs.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.111
How large?Well, Dr. Bell said

33:46.154 --> 33:49.331
that there were six departments
of hers awaiting funding.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.072
The bill was stuck
in committee for months.

33:51.116 --> 33:54.815
And now, after all the news
and public outcry, it passes.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.991
McGEE:
And all six departments
are now fully funded.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.602
Because of murder.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.735
Yeah, to quote the good doctor,

34:01.778 --> 34:03.998
"I'm just glad people
are paying attention."

34:04.042 --> 34:05.956
Yeah, that's pretty messed up.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.828
Yeah.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.438
Does the doc have an alibi?

34:12.528 --> 34:14.487
[snoring]

34:14.530 --> 34:16.532
[indistinct chatter]

34:17.925 --> 34:19.927
[phone rings]

34:23.844 --> 34:25.846
Gibbs.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.891
McGEE:
Boss, we need to talk
to the doctor again.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.197
All right.
Pick her up.

34:29.241 --> 34:30.894
Why are you still here?

34:30.938 --> 34:31.939
You got it.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.984
And don't you dare
say semper fi.

34:34.028 --> 34:35.899
How's the head?

34:35.943 --> 34:38.467
Hurts. I'll be okay.MAN: Pardon us, but

34:38.511 --> 34:40.208
we heard you've been keeping
watch out here all night.

34:40.252 --> 34:43.385
We also heard your hair
shimmers in the moonlight.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.300
[scoffs]
I never said that.

34:45.344 --> 34:46.867
[chuckles]

34:46.910 --> 34:48.434
Appreciate that you got our six.

34:52.960 --> 34:53.874
You're a Marine, right?

34:53.917 --> 34:55.310
Gibbs.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.833
Scout sniper.I knew it.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.748
Hey.I can smell a
fellow leatherneck.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.013
I'm looking at you, too.

35:03.057 --> 35:05.059
Look harder.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.930
I'm not a Marine anymore.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.933
The hell you talking about?
Once a Marine, always a Marine.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.935
Right, Gibbs?

35:11.979 --> 35:13.067
Oorah.

35:17.463 --> 35:20.509
Yes, I'm thrilled
the bill passed,

35:20.553 --> 35:22.294
but this is my one day off.

35:22.337 --> 35:23.730
[scoffs]

35:23.773 --> 35:25.862
I couldn't have done
any of this.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.212
Because you've been at work.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.822
Check my patient charts.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.824
We did.
Uh, there were plenty of gaps

35:30.867 --> 35:32.130
for you to leave the hospital.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.349
I use that time
for power naps.

35:34.393 --> 35:36.395
You ever stand
for 17 hours straight?

35:36.438 --> 35:39.833
The hands were in your cabinet
and you have no alibi.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.096
You want an alibi?

35:44.577 --> 35:45.752
I hate horses.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.362
[chuckles]
Excuse me?

35:47.406 --> 35:49.756
I fell off as a kid
and I get anxious

35:49.799 --> 35:51.845
just thinking about them,

35:51.888 --> 35:55.327
let alone parading them through
Arlington with amputated feet.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.981
Well, equine animosity
is not an alibi

35:58.025 --> 35:59.766
and you benefit from this bill.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.551
No.
The system benefits.

36:02.595 --> 36:05.859
It's not like I make money
personally. No one does.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.991
[knocking]

36:14.172 --> 36:15.999
Hey.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.438
Actually, people do
make money from this bill.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.353
Very personally.

36:21.396 --> 36:24.747
I was listening. Uh, the
V.A. system is back online

36:24.791 --> 36:26.793
and I pulled financial records.

36:26.836 --> 36:29.230
The six departments.Turns out only one
is a private company

36:29.274 --> 36:31.450
that only works with the V.A.--

36:31.493 --> 36:33.452
Mercy Point Mobile Care.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.236
Medical vans.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.934
So this bill takes
their program nationwide.

36:37.978 --> 36:39.240
Only if it passes.

36:39.284 --> 36:42.330
And this wasn't going to
until two days ago.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.898
Yeah, when someone started
chopping off body parts.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.987
Someone whose
family owns horses.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.510
Who are we talking about?

36:48.554 --> 36:50.947
Kyle Freeman.
Turns out he's not a volunteer.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.471
His family owns the company.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.255
Does Gibbs know about this?Not yet.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.952
He's still at the camp.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.345
With our killer.

36:57.389 --> 36:58.651
Yeah.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.176
Listen, I'm just thrilled
that our message

37:02.220 --> 37:03.917
will finally be out there.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.223
Yeah.
Wherever there's a need.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.050
Oh, hey.
Morning, guys.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.052
Hey, Gibbs.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.880
FREEMAN:
Yeah. No, no, you get it.

37:10.924 --> 37:12.839
Yeah, so I figure, like,
if we-we put these buses

37:12.882 --> 37:15.581
in every location...You okay?

37:15.624 --> 37:18.105
Hey, hey.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.890
You got our six?

37:24.111 --> 37:25.330
Yeah?

37:26.679 --> 37:27.897
GIBBS:
Hey, hey!

37:27.941 --> 37:29.116
[chuckles]:
Hold up. Hold up.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.292
Morning.
How can I help you, sir?

37:31.336 --> 37:32.946
You already have.
I just wanted to recognize

37:32.989 --> 37:34.687
all your hard work.Thank you.

37:34.730 --> 37:37.690
You know, it's tough out here,
but Mercy Point Mobile Care--

37:37.733 --> 37:41.215
it's-it's a very worthy cause.Yes, it is.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.130
Just not for you.

37:43.173 --> 37:44.740
Excuse me? I...

37:44.784 --> 37:47.047
Bandages, cheap ink.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.309
[chuckles]:
Wait, wait, wait. I...

37:48.353 --> 37:50.311
I don't follow.Sawing bone?

37:50.355 --> 37:52.095
That's hard work.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.314
[laughs]:
Okay.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.316
I don't know what that means.It means

37:55.360 --> 37:57.318
you kill veterans.Ha!

37:57.362 --> 37:58.928
That's crazy.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.888
Speak up
for the camera, sir.

38:01.931 --> 38:03.411
People aren't just numbers
on a bottom line.

38:03.455 --> 38:04.934
They have names.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.501
Turn that off.No.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.553
Navy Seaman Ronald T. Jones.

38:16.555 --> 38:19.035
Army Sergeant Donald Pretorius.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.953
Marine Sergeant
Francesca Rinaldi.

38:25.999 --> 38:29.307
Marine Lance Corporal
Bernard Ernest Williams.

38:32.571 --> 38:36.009
Hey. Get the hell
out of my face.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.838
No.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.232
[Kyle coughing]

38:42.276 --> 38:43.973
[handcuffs clicking]

38:44.017 --> 38:45.671
Oorah.

39:01.861 --> 39:04.080
Kyle wanted attention
and he got it.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.909
TORRES:
Boom. Along with
a fist to the face.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.129
Everybody loves it
when the bad guy goes down.

39:09.172 --> 39:12.480
Look at this. 17 million likes
in less than three days.

39:12.524 --> 39:16.092
Wait, does this make Gibbs
an influencer?

39:16.136 --> 39:18.138
[laughs][Terry clears throat]

39:18.181 --> 39:19.357
That a cell phone?

39:24.144 --> 39:27.103
Because I, uh...
I haven't seen the video yet.

39:27.147 --> 39:30.542
I was wondering if maybe
I could... watch it?

39:30.585 --> 39:34.110
I heard the guy confessed
to desecrating the first body.

39:34.154 --> 39:35.373
Yeah.
Yeah, he claimed

39:35.416 --> 39:38.114
that killing Norma Jean
was an "accident."

39:38.158 --> 39:41.291
Cutting off her hands wasn't.
Good cause, bad man.

39:41.335 --> 39:44.164
Well, I'm glad
you got the bastard.

39:44.207 --> 39:48.124
However, you are way behind
on your quota.

39:48.168 --> 39:51.040
Not to mention those prepaid
cell phones have gone missing.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.130
And all that's
left is this.

39:54.174 --> 39:57.743
DOLL:
I love you, and I'm sorry.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.745
Whoa. Don't look at me, man.
We're friends now.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.137
I wouldn't touch that thing.

40:01.181 --> 40:04.097
Yeah, and what's this
about missing cell phones?

40:04.140 --> 40:05.577
I guess the director's
just gonna have to

40:05.620 --> 40:07.100
add a couple extra days
to your sentence.

40:07.143 --> 40:08.797
VANCE:
That won't be necessary.

40:08.841 --> 40:09.798
Sir, there...

40:09.842 --> 40:11.234
there's evidence missing.

40:11.278 --> 40:14.890
I'll handle this one.
Personally.

40:24.465 --> 40:27.250
Call. Anytime.

40:27.294 --> 40:30.732
Fine. But only because you
brought enough for everybody.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.255
I thought you might
want this, too.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.388
We found it in the trunk
of Kyle's car.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.824
It's already been processed.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.437
Thank you.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.003
There's plenty
of empty pages in there

40:41.047 --> 40:42.657
if you want to add
your own story.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.791
No.

40:45.834 --> 40:48.576
I'm not gonna write it.

40:48.620 --> 40:52.580
I'm gonna tell it, out loud.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.192
Come on.

40:56.236 --> 40:59.457
Her social media reach
is over six million.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.459
HOST:
That's good. I want to hear...

41:01.502 --> 41:05.158
Plus, it helps to hear
people's stories. Right, sir?

41:05.201 --> 41:07.203
Don't call me sir...

41:07.247 --> 41:09.205
Marine.

41:12.426 --> 41:13.906
Hey.
