My family's journals were the missing
piece Hawkman never had.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.886
Now we know where to look
for the weapon...

39:56.685 --> 39:58.266
...so it's my job to go ﬁnd it.

Fighting Darkseid
isn't your own personal quest.

40:05.277 --> 40:06.858
We're all in this together.

40:09.031 --> 40:11.693
I just need you to trust me
on this one, okay?

40:14.453 --> 40:16.910
There's enough water
under our collective bridge...

40:17.081 --> 40:20.073
...that if you need me
not to ask questions...

40:20.251 --> 40:21.457
...I can do that.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.875
Thank you.
