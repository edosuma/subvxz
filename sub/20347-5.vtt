<font color=#FFFF00>"My Identity"</font>

00:31.711 --> 00:34.704
I've been told that
I look like an average person.

00:36.644 --> 00:39.942
But some of the characteristics

00:40.031 --> 00:42.199
that somewhat stick out are,

00:42.275 --> 00:44.721
I would say, I have a big nose.

00:44.828 --> 00:46.569
It's not very symmetrical.

00:51.603 --> 00:55.396
My eyes are spaced apart.

00:55.804 --> 00:59.125
I do have distinct moles
on my right side of my face.

01:04.179 --> 01:07.057
I think a lot of people
probably look like that.

01:08.293 --> 01:10.527
The face...

01:10.553 --> 01:14.029
it's the way we recognize each other.

01:14.128 --> 01:17.602
But to machines, we are code.

01:20.363 --> 01:23.560
We are being transformed
into a face print,

01:24.568 --> 01:26.661
a unique set of points that converts

01:26.711 --> 01:29.518
our very humanity into data,

01:30.865 --> 01:33.380
traceable, trackable,

01:34.228 --> 01:35.419
forever,

01:36.607 --> 01:39.252
online or on the streets.

01:40.017 --> 01:43.361
Will you ever be a face
in the crowd again?

01:58.737 --> 02:03.599
On September 5th,
we opened the bank at 9:00.

02:04.216 --> 02:08.247
We had a line, probably five
or six people in line.

02:08.865 --> 02:10.926
The next client that came to the window

02:11.018 --> 02:13.443
handed me a piece of paper.

02:13.756 --> 02:16.419
It was enclosed in a plastic envelope.

02:16.725 --> 02:19.271
And I'm going, "Oh, my gosh," you know.

02:19.365 --> 02:21.451
And it's like my heart just sunk.

02:22.163 --> 02:25.708
On September 5, 2014, Bonita Shipp

02:25.865 --> 02:29.068
came face-to-face
with a bank robber.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.971
As I was getting the money ready,

02:35.529 --> 02:36.909
I studied his face.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.646
I tried to recognize

02:39.725 --> 02:41.615
any markings at all.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.417
He had sunglasses on.

02:44.482 --> 02:45.779
And he had a cap on.

02:45.857 --> 02:49.122
So I couldn't see anything
from his eyes up.

02:49.536 --> 02:53.642
But I looked at his nose.
He had thin lips.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.814
He had no tattoos, no scars, nothing.

02:57.939 --> 03:00.196
So I took all of the money
out of my drawer,

03:00.298 --> 03:01.353
put it all in an envelope.

03:01.451 --> 03:03.935
And I handed it to him.
And then he left.

03:04.458 --> 03:09.419
He got away with just
a little under $3,000.

03:18.685 --> 03:21.470
One of the most
prominent things about humans

03:21.788 --> 03:24.595
is that they use their vision
to do many things.

03:24.951 --> 03:27.858
We recognize friends from foe.

03:29.595 --> 03:32.279
We recognize familiar faces.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.095
We recognize objects.

03:36.469 --> 03:39.119
We use our vision in a way that's very,

03:39.158 --> 03:41.431
very essential to our survival.

03:45.878 --> 03:48.947
Could computers
one day recognize faces?

03:49.189 --> 03:50.486
That's the question

03:50.580 --> 03:54.026
that haunted face recognition
pioneer Joseph Atick.

03:55.087 --> 03:57.548
I grew up in Jerusalem,

03:57.916 --> 04:00.767
where it was necessary

04:01.025 --> 04:02.925
to always travel with an I.D.,

04:03.009 --> 04:05.783
to present it two or three times a day

04:05.970 --> 04:07.744
to go from one town to the other.

04:07.908 --> 04:09.962
I believed that we needed something

04:10.068 --> 04:12.228
that was more effective
in securing the world.

04:12.337 --> 04:15.291
So I applied mathematical techniques

04:15.408 --> 04:17.861
to the study of the human brain.

04:20.173 --> 04:22.212
There are four elements

04:22.305 --> 04:24.447
in a facial-recognition technology.

04:24.728 --> 04:26.830
One is the algorithm,

04:26.986 --> 04:29.220
which is inspired by the human brain.

04:29.599 --> 04:32.587
Second was the need
to have a camera in order

04:32.783 --> 04:35.869
to allow the vision, like the eye.

04:37.161 --> 04:39.927
You needed to also have the database.

04:40.064 --> 04:42.931
You needed to have the memory

04:43.013 --> 04:46.060
of people who are known.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.502
Humans, for example,

04:47.607 --> 04:50.552
we remember about 2,000 people.

04:51.138 --> 04:52.732
That's our database.

04:52.821 --> 04:54.754
And in order to run the algorithm,

04:54.811 --> 04:56.185
we need processing power.

04:56.246 --> 04:58.224
We do it effortlessly
because we don't think of it.

04:58.248 --> 05:01.182
But, in fact, when I look
at your face, many,

05:01.232 --> 05:03.451
many calculations happen in my brain.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.052
It is so innate that
we don't even think about it.

05:09.505 --> 05:13.060
Three or four years
of mathematical took us

05:13.155 --> 05:16.076
to develop the first
facial-recognition algorithm.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.521
This is FaceIt,

05:18.856 --> 05:20.524
the first commercial product

05:20.589 --> 05:23.841
using face-recognition
technology developed by Atick

05:23.951 --> 05:26.302
and his team in 1995.

05:26.842 --> 05:29.958
It opened a new window
to our digital world.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.396
The genie's now out of the bottle.

05:32.646 --> 05:35.818
And any attempt
to put it back, technologically,

05:36.041 --> 05:37.255
is doomed

05:38.341 --> 05:40.919
because I started getting a lot of calls

05:41.099 --> 05:43.733
from intelligence agencies
around the world

05:43.951 --> 05:49.177
who thought this would be
quite useful for their mission.

06:23.294 --> 06:25.896
Facial recognition is simply the ability

06:26.005 --> 06:27.193
for law enforcement

06:27.279 --> 06:29.067
to electronically search

06:29.130 --> 06:32.771
against millions of photo images.

06:33.741 --> 06:36.341
Next-generation identification,

06:36.560 --> 06:39.240
the FBI's biometric network,

06:40.080 --> 06:43.443
overseen by assistant
director Stephen Morris.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.419
The system is looking
for key features of a face.

06:47.763 --> 06:50.661
It'll measure the distance
between the eyes...

06:52.892 --> 06:55.115
the distance between the ears,

06:56.505 --> 06:58.661
the ears in relation to the mouth.

06:59.527 --> 07:02.828
And then it's looking for
other images in that repository

07:02.990 --> 07:05.576
that have those same measurements.

07:10.107 --> 07:12.143
Our database consists of around

07:12.294 --> 07:14.497
30 million mug-shot photos.

07:16.685 --> 07:19.615
There are also repositories
of photographs

07:19.741 --> 07:21.485
that have been lawfully collected,

07:21.576 --> 07:24.120
such as visa photos, travel documents

07:24.255 --> 07:26.404
and driver's license photo files.

07:26.706 --> 07:29.779
So we're talking about more
than just 30 million photos

07:29.857 --> 07:32.951
that can be searched using
facial-recognition technology.

07:33.103 --> 07:34.951
The potential is unlimited.

07:35.304 --> 07:37.204
About half of American adults

07:37.302 --> 07:39.693
are in a law-enforcement database.

07:40.029 --> 07:42.208
Most don't even know it.

07:42.911 --> 07:46.286
To store the world's largest
biometrics database

07:46.313 --> 07:49.927
is a 100,000-square-foot data center,

07:50.536 --> 07:53.552
about the size of
a lower Manhattan block.

07:58.677 --> 07:59.918
Just be advised,

07:59.970 --> 08:03.021
there was an RP accident
at 112 precinct.

08:04.388 --> 08:07.497
I've been working in the 6-7
for about 2 1/2,

08:07.610 --> 08:09.130
going on 3 years.

08:09.302 --> 08:11.740
We have the pictures of people

08:11.865 --> 08:13.951
who were involved in a shooting.

08:14.146 --> 08:16.630
So when you come into contact

08:16.747 --> 08:18.732
with that person, they know who we are.

08:18.833 --> 08:22.513
But now we have a step up
because we know who you are.

08:24.781 --> 08:27.044
About 35,000 officers

08:27.119 --> 08:29.259
patrol the streets of New York City.

08:29.411 --> 08:31.693
But even the nation's
largest police force

08:31.788 --> 08:34.388
can use an extra pair of eyes...

08:37.794 --> 08:39.599
or 10,000 of them.

08:55.303 --> 08:57.631
These cameras aren't just watching.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.561
With the help of live analytics,

08:59.686 --> 09:02.577
they can detect what
the human eye cannot,

09:02.692 --> 09:04.569
a shot fired,

09:05.053 --> 09:06.587
a suspicious package

09:06.670 --> 09:08.913
or a suspect running from a crime.

09:09.436 --> 09:10.936
And they transmit this data

09:10.984 --> 09:13.764
directly to the real-time crime center.

09:14.045 --> 09:16.085
The main purpose of
this unit is to help identify

09:16.163 --> 09:18.585
anybody who's unknown
in a criminal investigation.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.311
The software enhances
surveillance footage.

09:21.381 --> 09:23.913
We're able to convert
a 2D image to a 3D image.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.279
And it's going to convert that image

09:25.303 --> 09:27.397
to a more proper pose
that we're going to need,

09:27.475 --> 09:29.436
similar to a driver's
license or a mug shot.

09:29.663 --> 09:32.311
Facial recognition has
tremendous potential

09:32.447 --> 09:34.180
when you're looking for the proverbial

09:34.280 --> 09:35.705
needle in a haystack.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.522
It provides you a lead,

09:37.592 --> 09:39.600
particularly in an instance
where you don't know

09:39.678 --> 09:41.460
who it is you're looking for.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.633
My name is Steve Talley.

09:54.830 --> 09:58.861
I lived in Colorado.
I had a beautiful family.

09:59.001 --> 10:00.627
I was a loving father.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.713
I have two kids.

10:03.677 --> 10:06.361
I have a daughter
who is 12 this February.

10:06.947 --> 10:09.549
I have a son who had just
turned 9 last week.

10:11.416 --> 10:16.338
We lived in a very nice,
family-oriented community.

10:16.423 --> 10:20.611
And I had a great career
in financial services.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.329
And I was, at that time,
excited about my life

10:24.416 --> 10:26.947
and my prospects and the future.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.006
I was living the American dream...

10:31.901 --> 10:33.643
or so I thought.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.842
My life changed dramatically.

10:37.311 --> 10:39.335
I got divorced from my ex-wife.

10:39.579 --> 10:43.600
And then I got laid off
due to corporate restructuring.

10:43.983 --> 10:45.750
I had financial obligations.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.889
I still had child-support payments

10:48.053 --> 10:49.499
of about $2,000 a month.

10:49.622 --> 10:52.322
But I considered myself
to still be an average,

10:52.506 --> 10:54.202
law-abiding citizen.

10:54.342 --> 10:55.694
But the authorities thought

10:55.769 --> 10:58.897
he was living a double life
as a serial bank robber.

10:59.131 --> 11:01.960
And even local news joined in the hunt.

11:02.534 --> 11:03.800
Do you recognize this man?

11:03.905 --> 11:05.545
Denver police are
looking for him tonight.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.336
They say he robbed the U.S. Bank

11:07.444 --> 11:08.738
on South Colorado Boulevard

11:08.835 --> 11:11.283
near East Mississippi
and Glendale last week.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.703
Have a look at his picture

11:12.744 --> 11:14.608
taken by surveillance
cameras in the bank.

11:14.710 --> 11:17.928
Police say he may be armed with a gun.

11:19.083 --> 11:23.053
One day, there was
a pounding at my door.

11:23.454 --> 11:27.957
All of a sudden, I see
a gentleman with the FBI jacket.

11:28.115 --> 11:30.858
He handcuffed me behind my back.

11:31.987 --> 11:35.600
He said, "Do you know
why we're arresting you?"

11:37.987 --> 11:41.069
He said, "We're arresting you
for two armed bank robberies

11:41.194 --> 11:43.264
and assaulting a police officer."

11:44.341 --> 11:47.100
I was driven to the detention center.

11:48.579 --> 11:51.491
I was in prison
in a maximum-security pod

11:51.913 --> 11:56.569
because they had very
strong facial recognition

11:57.254 --> 12:00.188
that proved that I was the guy.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.694
But I always said I was innocent.

12:04.995 --> 12:09.756
I had an air-tight alibi.
I shared it with everyone.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.299
I had my own witnesses

12:11.366 --> 12:14.006
for the alibi come in
and prove I was there.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.904
But my only crime is I,

12:16.983 --> 12:19.545
apparently, look like someone else.

12:20.142 --> 12:22.202
I really have nothing to hide.

12:27.836 --> 12:32.116
Nothing to hide, nothing to fear, right?

12:34.608 --> 12:37.335
Face rec gets the bad guys
off the streets.

12:37.492 --> 12:39.327
So what's the harm?

12:40.396 --> 12:42.108
I grew up in a world

12:42.202 --> 12:45.717
where identity was part
of our daily experience

12:45.858 --> 12:49.233
at a time when the
world was in conflict.

12:50.177 --> 12:52.819
In societies where there was
an oppressive regime,

12:52.975 --> 12:54.819
there was a chilling factor.

12:55.116 --> 12:58.311
People did not express
themselves freely

12:58.431 --> 13:02.194
because there was a fear
that they would be persecuted.

13:03.051 --> 13:05.569
Now we have a different
kind of chilling factor.

13:05.936 --> 13:07.563
And it is driven not by governments,

13:07.670 --> 13:10.600
necessarily, but by
the surveillance camera.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.655
And that chilling factor,

13:12.725 --> 13:15.288
it means we're going
to change our behavior.

13:16.092 --> 13:18.803
And we no longer live in a free society.

13:19.629 --> 13:21.838
Will that be a society
that we will accept?

13:32.457 --> 13:33.920
Zoom in.

13:34.874 --> 13:36.967
Try to get as close up as you can.

13:37.256 --> 13:38.967
Take a quick snapshot.

13:42.824 --> 13:44.624
By walking in to a casino,

13:44.791 --> 13:48.116
you have effectively
given up your privacy

13:48.311 --> 13:49.627
because, in a casino,

13:49.707 --> 13:51.920
you really want to know your customer.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.699
So facial recognition

13:54.803 --> 13:56.834
dramatically improved the ability

13:56.920 --> 13:59.483
to actively track card counters,

13:59.889 --> 14:01.749
high net-worth individuals,

14:02.335 --> 14:05.249
cheaters and all sorts
of other individuals

14:05.335 --> 14:07.411
that the casinos
are interested in tracking.

14:10.085 --> 14:12.038
The man behind this technology

14:12.139 --> 14:13.389
is Wyly Wade,

14:13.585 --> 14:16.772
who provides it to 200
casinos across the country.

14:16.858 --> 14:19.631
Facial recognition is contactless.

14:19.756 --> 14:21.725
It is noninvasive.

14:22.085 --> 14:25.670
And it is the link
from your digital environment

14:25.811 --> 14:28.225
to your physical environment.

14:29.095 --> 14:31.616
Part of this is a very
personal issue to me.

14:38.561 --> 14:40.717
I've got a daughter with special needs.

14:40.835 --> 14:43.256
She's deaf. She's autistic.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.117
My daughter loves to climb.

14:47.264 --> 14:49.124
She flips. She twirls.

14:49.303 --> 14:50.842
I'm the human jungle gym.

14:51.061 --> 14:53.241
Oh, now you're going to run away, huh?

14:55.193 --> 14:56.726
She laughs. She plays.

14:56.827 --> 14:58.639
She runs. She hides.

15:00.170 --> 15:01.998
But she doesn't have this filter

15:02.077 --> 15:04.225
on what is good and what is bad.

15:04.413 --> 15:08.249
So we need an extra level
of security to re-create

15:08.342 --> 15:10.686
some of that filter for her.

15:20.059 --> 15:22.926
We have cameras that
automatically rotate,

15:23.595 --> 15:24.674
pan,

15:25.535 --> 15:28.668
tilt, zoom,

15:28.925 --> 15:31.285
all based off of either sound

15:32.443 --> 15:34.121
or motion.

15:34.705 --> 15:38.387
If that camera detects
that there's a face there,

15:38.551 --> 15:40.512
then what it does is it drops it down

15:40.606 --> 15:42.681
to our security system

15:42.714 --> 15:44.692
and then compares that to the people

15:44.754 --> 15:46.950
that I don't want into our house

15:48.043 --> 15:51.145
so that that way you
can be prewarned or preconfirm

15:51.215 --> 15:54.551
whether or not that person
is a rapist or sex offender

15:54.684 --> 15:56.164
because we have hundreds of thousands

15:56.262 --> 15:58.653
of registered sex offenders
in the United States.

15:58.856 --> 16:01.289
So if the UPS driver happens to be

16:01.371 --> 16:02.490
a registered sex offender,

16:02.590 --> 16:05.364
yeah, I'd like to be
notified about that.

16:06.270 --> 16:09.029
Facial recognition gives
us peace of mind.

16:09.098 --> 16:12.121
You don't know where
the real danger lies.

16:12.301 --> 16:14.387
You don't know who the hooligans are.

16:14.536 --> 16:17.043
You probably don't even
know your neighbors.

16:24.770 --> 16:28.129
Facial recognition is not
positive identification.

16:28.463 --> 16:30.173
If you're looking for an individual,

16:30.543 --> 16:33.910
and you submit a search, and you
get 14 back in your gallery,

16:34.075 --> 16:36.403
there could be 14 wrong people in there.

16:36.590 --> 16:39.473
And that is where it's up
to the investigator

16:39.731 --> 16:40.918
to take the information

16:40.973 --> 16:42.598
that comes with that picture.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.902
After the robbery, the police

16:49.989 --> 16:52.239
and the FBI came,
and they interviewed me,

16:52.309 --> 16:55.161
and they wanted me
to identify the person

16:55.286 --> 16:56.934
and do a photo lineup.

16:58.830 --> 17:01.872
There were six people on that page.

17:02.223 --> 17:06.528
You know, I said, "Well, this
kind of looks like the guy."

17:06.887 --> 17:09.551
And they asked me like,
"What percentage do you think?"

17:09.708 --> 17:13.424
And I said, "Well, probably maybe 85%,

17:13.502 --> 17:16.010
but I'm not 100% sure."

17:21.434 --> 17:24.069
Instead of using my
mug shot in this photo lineup,

17:24.157 --> 17:27.165
which they typically do because
it's the most recent picture,

17:27.612 --> 17:29.237
they actually used the picture

17:29.331 --> 17:32.581
where I got my DUI in 2011.

17:32.713 --> 17:33.878
They're using this picture

17:33.971 --> 17:37.042
from 5 years ago where I look younger.

17:38.002 --> 17:41.284
That same DUI mug
shot is what the FBI used

17:41.424 --> 17:43.706
to compare Talley to the robber.

17:43.946 --> 17:45.338
I didn't think he looked like me.

17:45.385 --> 17:47.182
But I could see some similarities.

17:47.245 --> 17:50.510
And I think he probably
looked like a gazillion people.

17:51.245 --> 17:53.330
But in court, the eyewitness faces

17:53.401 --> 17:55.831
the suspect not in pixels

17:56.260 --> 17:57.690
but in the flesh.

17:58.470 --> 17:59.675
I insisted

17:59.729 --> 18:02.502
I would have to see
Mr. Talley in person

18:02.627 --> 18:06.315
because I want to make sure
that my decision is right.

18:07.323 --> 18:10.151
The robber had no markings, no moles.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.831
And when you see this Mr. Talley,

18:12.933 --> 18:14.573
he has a mole on his cheek.

18:15.432 --> 18:18.417
Also, Mr. Talley had a long nose.

18:18.900 --> 18:21.088
The other guy's nose was shorter.

18:21.963 --> 18:24.854
And Mr. Talley is a big man.

18:25.663 --> 18:27.471
And the robber was not.

18:27.632 --> 18:29.279
And I told the judge,

18:29.357 --> 18:31.114
I said, "If you're asking me

18:31.239 --> 18:33.001
if this was the guy
that was the robber,"

18:33.075 --> 18:37.466
I said, "I am absolutely,
100% positive it is not."

18:40.010 --> 18:41.744
The FBI and local police

18:41.808 --> 18:45.388
said it was me based
on the similar features.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.350
But they totally ignored features

18:47.435 --> 18:50.193
that would exclude me
as being a suspect.

18:50.950 --> 18:54.252
Finally, they wanted
to do a height analysis.

18:54.892 --> 18:56.705
The bank robber was 6 foot.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.197
And they determined I was 6'3 1/2".

19:00.432 --> 19:02.754
So I was 3 inches too tall.

19:03.301 --> 19:06.418
That proved I couldn't
possibly be the guy.

19:07.496 --> 19:09.519
His face got him arrested.

19:09.721 --> 19:12.332
But his height set him free.

19:13.023 --> 19:14.926
I did get dismissed.

19:15.496 --> 19:17.175
But they seemed to be
trying to build a case

19:17.199 --> 19:19.207
where there really wasn't a case there.

19:19.282 --> 19:22.496
They didn't have any,
not even a shred, of evidence,

19:22.738 --> 19:25.730
except for I looked
like the bank robber.

19:26.379 --> 19:28.847
This is really scary stuff,
this technology.

19:29.058 --> 19:32.159
It could be a great shortcut
to help with investigations

19:32.222 --> 19:35.394
but at the expense of possibly,

19:35.664 --> 19:38.246
you know, targeting the wrong people.

19:44.874 --> 19:46.918
It could happen to you.

19:48.076 --> 19:51.035
As the database of faces grows larger,

19:51.494 --> 19:54.707
so does your chance
of having a doppelganger.

19:55.504 --> 19:58.590
There are more cameras
now than humans in the world.

19:58.894 --> 20:01.238
With people having
cameras in their pocket,

20:01.355 --> 20:02.599
cameras in the street,

20:02.660 --> 20:04.887
there are billions
of cameras in the world.

20:05.134 --> 20:07.652
That is a natural progression.

20:08.010 --> 20:09.863
And we saw some of it happening.

20:10.332 --> 20:13.299
But one thing we did not see,

20:13.379 --> 20:15.558
nor anyone saw or counted on,

20:15.808 --> 20:19.605
was the emergence of social media.

20:20.107 --> 20:23.129
If, in the '90s,
I told you that, one day,

20:23.277 --> 20:25.244
there was going to be a database

20:25.340 --> 20:28.472
where people voluntarily
add their faces

20:28.730 --> 20:31.683
and the faces of their friends
and the faces of their children,

20:31.785 --> 20:34.353
and that database
could be used to identify

20:34.449 --> 20:37.221
every single one
of those billion people,

20:37.394 --> 20:39.871
I would be laughed at back then.

20:41.886 --> 20:45.777
But now Facebook
is essentially a database

20:46.012 --> 20:48.644
that is the dream of a big brother.

20:49.027 --> 20:51.182
1.8 billion users,

20:51.543 --> 20:55.480
350 million pictures uploaded every day,

20:55.876 --> 20:59.143
we are the ones training
Facebook's facial recognition.

20:59.644 --> 21:00.754
How?

21:00.824 --> 21:03.293
By tagging ourselves and our friends.

21:03.616 --> 21:05.793
Their algorithm is so strong,

21:05.965 --> 21:09.426
Facebook can I.D. you even
if your face is hidden.

21:09.683 --> 21:11.289
There is money to be made

21:11.449 --> 21:13.510
from the recognition of your face.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.262
Imagine if you walked around,

21:15.340 --> 21:17.705
and on top of your head
it said your name,

21:17.861 --> 21:20.174
how much money you have, what you like,

21:20.314 --> 21:21.751
what are your preferences in life,

21:21.814 --> 21:24.165
and machines that run algorithms

21:24.376 --> 21:26.807
will start to make decisions for us.

21:27.087 --> 21:28.720
And as a consequence,

21:28.868 --> 21:31.368
we may lose the battle of privacy.

21:32.578 --> 21:35.032
I think privacy is
a misnomer at this point.

21:35.314 --> 21:37.462
We have to get over the idea

21:37.634 --> 21:40.822
that you own your data
and your identity.

21:41.017 --> 21:45.837
We gave up our right
to most of our data

21:46.055 --> 21:49.704
when every time we signed up
to Google or to Facebook

21:49.876 --> 21:51.260
because it was convenient.

21:51.337 --> 21:53.611
It improved your life in a lot of ways.

21:53.728 --> 21:55.665
But it also broke down a lot of barriers

21:55.798 --> 21:58.144
to where that data that you claim

21:58.267 --> 22:01.306
is your identity is no longer your data.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.923
You don't own it.

22:03.228 --> 22:06.040
We've almost gone to a post-privacy era.

22:07.551 --> 22:09.915
What does post privacy look like?

22:10.486 --> 22:12.214
Just ask the Russians.

22:12.338 --> 22:15.784
Findface, an app that
allows you to find any person

22:15.876 --> 22:18.384
in the largest Russian social network.

22:18.572 --> 22:21.236
It lets a user photograph a stranger,

22:21.337 --> 22:22.758
upload that picture

22:22.845 --> 22:25.173
and compare it to social media profiles

22:25.345 --> 22:27.282
to unmask the person's identity.

22:27.486 --> 22:28.548
The service allows you

22:28.673 --> 22:30.892
to not only find the desired user

22:31.001 --> 22:34.290
but also to send them messages
and other information.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.714
In other words,

22:35.868 --> 22:38.509
it's a dream come true for stalkers.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.611
To see a face recognition

22:41.689 --> 22:43.470
being abused in a certain way,

22:43.978 --> 22:47.259
it means that we no longer
live in a free society.

22:47.798 --> 22:50.798
But face recognition can be good

22:50.908 --> 22:52.173
as long as there's oversight

22:52.298 --> 22:55.220
to make sure no innocent individuals

22:55.295 --> 22:57.392
are accused.

23:04.548 --> 23:06.829
Now I'll wake up
in the middle of the night,

23:06.931 --> 23:08.775
and I won't know where I'm at.

23:08.938 --> 23:11.072
All of a sudden, it dawns on me.

23:12.341 --> 23:14.556
This nightmare is my life.

23:16.408 --> 23:19.306
Here I am. I'm actually in
a shelter right now.

23:23.785 --> 23:27.048
Even though they had
no case, it dragged on.

23:27.356 --> 23:31.259
It's two years after,
and I am still struggling.

23:31.829 --> 23:34.540
Because of this incident,
I lost my housing.

23:34.939 --> 23:38.331
And even just being
associated with bank robberies

23:38.447 --> 23:39.733
has, basically, effectively,

23:39.868 --> 23:43.517
black-balled me or destroyed
my career in financial services.

23:44.695 --> 23:46.462
No one's going to touch me.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.041
The biggest thing
is my custody situation.

23:52.236 --> 23:55.212
I haven't been able
to see my kids in two years.

23:58.553 --> 24:00.142
I've missed the Christmases,

24:00.204 --> 24:01.657
the birthdays, the Thanksgivings,

24:01.720 --> 24:03.642
all the memories of them growing up.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.126
I'm always concerned about them,

24:07.407 --> 24:09.407
what they're feeling, what their
thoughts are about me.

24:09.431 --> 24:11.470
Do they feel that
they've been abandoned,

24:11.665 --> 24:13.814
that their father doesn't love them?

24:15.337 --> 24:18.361
Being homeless is extremely hard.

24:19.406 --> 24:21.775
You know, I feel isolated.

24:21.975 --> 24:23.751
I feel like I'm invisible, too,

24:23.822 --> 24:26.493
because a lot of people
don't like to look at homeless.

24:26.680 --> 24:27.976
I'm in a pretty big hole right now

24:28.000 --> 24:29.728
that I have to dig myself out of.

24:29.949 --> 24:31.416
I'm fighting for my life back.

24:31.509 --> 24:34.111
That's really what this is
about is fighting to get my life

24:34.165 --> 24:35.657
back to where it was,

24:35.759 --> 24:39.673
to fight for myself, for my family.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.867
There's a lot of good
that's used of this technology.

24:49.947 --> 24:52.025
I use this to protect my family.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.105
Are there bad uses
of facial recognition?

24:55.157 --> 24:59.212
Absolutely, because we don't
live in a perfect world.

25:02.657 --> 25:06.079
Facial recognition is going
to create problems.

25:06.626 --> 25:08.743
There's going to be
some collateral damage.

25:09.228 --> 25:11.259
I guess I was collateral damage.

25:11.626 --> 25:13.970
My family was collateral damage.

25:14.893 --> 25:16.494
It happened to me.

25:16.642 --> 25:19.306
Why couldn't it happen to other people?

25:26.259 --> 25:29.434
Chances are your
face can be used against you.

25:29.626 --> 25:31.751
We all feed the network.

25:32.158 --> 25:33.737
The more data we upload,

25:33.979 --> 25:35.962
the more powerful it becomes,

25:36.431 --> 25:40.767
entangling our physical selves
into a digital web.

25:41.346 --> 25:44.728
We, as technologists,
have to be responsible

25:44.789 --> 25:46.447
for the creations that we've made.

25:46.557 --> 25:48.243
And we have to explain

25:48.368 --> 25:51.314
to the world the inherent danger.

25:52.564 --> 25:54.853
And that is the missing link

25:54.924 --> 25:59.189
between our online persona

25:59.598 --> 26:01.657
and our offline persona.

26:02.042 --> 26:04.618
The offline persona is our only persona.

26:04.702 --> 26:07.962
It's unique. It's us, makes us human.

26:08.245 --> 26:10.579
And the ability to protect that

26:10.845 --> 26:14.954
will depend on the ability
to stop face recognition

26:15.087 --> 26:17.595
from recognizing us without consent.

26:21.158 --> 26:24.806
And I don't believe we can afford

26:25.588 --> 26:27.306
to lose control

26:27.462 --> 26:29.603
over the most precious thing...

26:33.292 --> 26:34.853
which is our identity.
