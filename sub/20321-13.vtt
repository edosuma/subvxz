WEBVTT

00:02.229 --> 00:05.065
Come on, let's go!
Can we get some help here?

00:10.271 --> 00:12.905
- How is he?
- He's lost a lot of blood.

00:12.973 --> 00:15.140
The bullet's lodged
in his upper left arm.

00:15.208 --> 00:17.391
We've stabilized the wound, but we
gotta get him to OR stat.

00:17.511 --> 00:20.045
-  I'm on it. Is he going to be OK?
- Oh, yeah. We've given him

00:20.113 --> 00:23.148
2mg of morphine. He's not gonna feel
anything until after the surgery.

00:23.216 --> 00:25.451
Here we go. You got that, Bill?

00:25.518 --> 00:28.053
- All right, one, two, three.
- Here we go.

00:28.121 --> 00:31.289
- Yep, there we go. OK.
<i>- I told him not to go so fast.</i>

00:31.357 --> 00:33.724
<i>- I missed a payment</i>
<i>- Where did he go?</i>

00:33.792 --> 00:36.294
<i>What's taking</i>
<i>so long?</i>

00:36.362 --> 00:40.231
<i>- One shot and it'll be over.</i>
<i>- They said two hours.</i>

00:40.299 --> 00:42.367
<i>She knows she's gonna</i>
<i>make me suffer.</i>

00:42.434 --> 00:44.935
<i>I don't think I can do this</i>
<i>anymore, Adam.</i>

00:45.003 --> 00:47.504
<i>- That guy smells terrible.</i>
<i>- His weakness is</i>

00:47.571 --> 00:50.273
<i>my opportunity.</i> So you know
exactly what you have to do.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.876
He must be dead within 48 hours.

00:52.943 --> 00:55.445
Give me 10mg of diazepam.

01:00.485 --> 01:03.285
We're gonna take him
into surgery right away.

01:37.540 --> 01:40.442
Hey. You mind telling me
what you think you're doing?

01:40.509 --> 01:43.845
- I'm fine.
- You're fine?

01:43.913 --> 01:46.347
I just need to speak
to Michelle. It's important.

01:46.415 --> 01:49.150
You know what else is important? Letting
the fresh bullet wound in your arm heal.

01:49.217 --> 01:50.651
Look, I'm fine, OK?

01:50.718 --> 01:52.886
- Oh, yeah? You sure?
- Yeah.

01:52.955 --> 01:55.656
Whoa, hey.
See, that is not "fine", OK?

01:55.723 --> 01:59.927
That is "I just got shot".
Come on. Legs up, let's go.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.395
Come here. You wanna talk
to Michelle? There ya go.

02:02.463 --> 02:04.197
I'll go get her, all right?

02:04.265 --> 02:06.232
- You Just stay here and relax.
- Yeah, all right.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.668
Also, you know,
don't let this happen again.

02:08.735 --> 02:10.836
I'm not happy with this whole
shooting thing.

02:10.904 --> 02:12.839
Sorry, Dad.

02:12.906 --> 02:14.507
Dev.

02:14.575 --> 02:16.175
I'll be right back.

02:16.242 --> 02:18.177
- How is he?
- He's pretty good. He's

02:18.244 --> 02:21.080
stubborn, but he's pretty good.
He really wants to see you guys,

02:21.147 --> 02:23.748
- but he's gotta take it easy.
- You convinced him of that?

02:23.816 --> 02:26.718
Look, if he strains himself, that wound
could open up, maybe get infected.

02:26.786 --> 02:30.089
- We'll take care of him.
- Thanks. Corporal.

02:32.057 --> 02:34.592
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:34.659 --> 02:37.261
If you needed a vacation, you
could've just said something.

02:37.329 --> 02:39.430
Yeah, it wasn't
my first choice.

02:39.498 --> 02:41.432
All right, I know
this is gonna sound crazy,

02:41.500 --> 02:43.767
but when they were
bringing me in, I read someone

02:43.835 --> 02:46.304
- planning a murder.
- Well, Toby,

02:46.372 --> 02:48.905
you were barely conscious,
and heavily sedated.

02:48.973 --> 02:50.440
I know what I read.

02:50.508 --> 02:52.876
I don't know where it came from.
The ER was crowded.

02:52.943 --> 02:54.978
- That's not a lot to go on.
- I saw someone passing

02:55.046 --> 02:57.780
a photo and he said that the guy
in the photo had to be dead

02:57.848 --> 03:00.450
- within 48 hours.
- OK, um,

03:00.518 --> 03:03.853
let's try to... work up
a facial composite and see

03:03.921 --> 03:06.188
if we can track this guy down.
That's not necessary.

03:06.256 --> 03:09.591
The guy's name is Gerard Perrault.
He's France's Minister of Justice.

03:09.659 --> 03:11.860
So you're saying someone
in this hospital is going to try

03:11.928 --> 03:14.163
to kill a major
French politician.

03:14.231 --> 03:17.997
- I trust what I read, guys.
- OK. Let me talk to Oz.

03:18.117 --> 03:20.908
I'll see if I can get the ER
security tapes and a log

03:21.028 --> 03:22.378
- of everyone who was here.
- OK.

03:22.498 --> 03:24.221
- Maybe we get a hit.
- Let's do this.

03:24.289 --> 03:25.923
Look, Toby,
I know how hard this is

03:25.991 --> 03:28.626
even for an experienced officer
to shoot someone.

03:28.694 --> 03:32.029
The best thing for me to do is
keep my mind off it, right?

03:32.097 --> 03:34.431
Look... let's see
what we can do.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.133
Let's dig into this.

03:36.201 --> 03:38.702
- OK.
- Yeah.

03:42.307 --> 03:44.375
So, what do you think?
We getting close?

03:44.442 --> 03:46.543
You're good at what you do.
That's him.

03:46.611 --> 03:49.579
Run it wide, both criminal
databases here and in Europe.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.982
This might be a problem that
followed Perrault from France.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.391
Is there anything from the
security cameras at the hospital?

03:54.511 --> 03:57.353
I'm still running it
and the nurses' logs to see

03:57.421 --> 04:00.483
if anyone has a criminal record or any
connection to Perrault, but nothing yet.

04:00.603 --> 04:03.026
I've requested a meeting
with the French contingent.

04:03.093 --> 04:04.960
I wish I had something more solid
to go in with.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.576
What's this?

04:06.696 --> 04:09.765
That's the SIU shooting team.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.735
Michelle's already done her interview.
You just need to give a statement.

04:12.802 --> 04:16.572
You just have to go through the story
in your own words. It'll be fine.

04:19.274 --> 04:21.243
- Consultant Logan?
- Hey.

04:21.310 --> 04:23.512
- Are ready to speak with us?
- Yeah.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.280
After you.

04:28.283 --> 04:30.117
How's he holding up?

04:30.185 --> 04:31.853
He says he's fine.

04:31.921 --> 04:34.055
That's not what I asked.

04:34.122 --> 04:37.625
You understand that we've already talked
to your partner, Sergeant McCluskey?

04:37.693 --> 04:39.694
- Yeah, yeah, she told me.
- She said

04:39.762 --> 04:43.264
you acted with exceptional bravery.
This meeting is largely a formality.

04:43.331 --> 04:45.799
- I did what I had to do...
- Um...

04:45.867 --> 04:49.136
you're still gonna have to go through the
events of what happened the other night.

04:51.106 --> 04:53.974
Well, we arrived
at the scene of the shooting

04:54.042 --> 04:56.343
at about 7:30pm.

04:56.411 --> 04:58.311
We heard a lot of gunfire.

04:58.379 --> 05:00.613
And...

05:00.681 --> 05:02.615
uh, we went in the building.

05:02.683 --> 05:04.850
OK. Go on.

05:04.918 --> 05:08.188
We went up to the second floor

05:08.255 --> 05:10.823
and, uh...

05:10.891 --> 05:14.126
the suspect appeared
from the third floor.

05:14.194 --> 05:18.830
Drew his weapon, fired,
hit me in the arm.

05:18.898 --> 05:21.333
- Then what happened?
- My partner came to me,

05:21.401 --> 05:24.303
asked me how I was.
I said I was fine and...

05:24.370 --> 05:27.005
the suspect had disappeared
so she went after him.

05:27.073 --> 05:28.907
And you followed?

05:36.515 --> 05:38.448
So, I...

05:38.516 --> 05:40.484
I went up to the third floor

05:40.551 --> 05:44.821
and there on the ground was
a gun. I picked it up,

05:44.888 --> 05:47.357
went down the south corridor...

05:47.425 --> 05:50.327
turned a corner...

05:50.394 --> 05:52.795
Drop it!

05:52.863 --> 05:54.830
Turns around with his gun

05:54.897 --> 05:57.633
pointing at me and I fired.
So, even with

05:57.700 --> 05:59.468
limited firearm training,

05:59.536 --> 06:02.204
you managed to hit your target
under that kind of pressure.

06:02.272 --> 06:05.341
I fired and he went down.
That's all I know.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.210
- Your intention was to disable him?
- Are you asking if I tried

06:08.278 --> 06:10.811
to kill him?

06:15.717 --> 06:18.253
I... I...

06:18.320 --> 06:19.854
No.

06:21.857 --> 06:24.425
I guess that about
wraps it up, Consultant Logan.

06:24.493 --> 06:28.162
Your commander will
inform you of our findings.

06:28.229 --> 06:31.365
OK.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.167
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:33.234 --> 06:36.069
So, we think Dev found a match
for the man who ordered the hit.

06:36.137 --> 06:39.739
- Yeah. That's the guy.
- His name's

06:39.807 --> 06:43.075
Julien Couvreur. He's a French national, but
he's been on the run for the last three years.

06:43.143 --> 06:45.144
He's wanted for operating
a murder-for-hire ring.

06:45.212 --> 06:48.113
Yeah, French police believe that he's
still running the operation from abroad.

06:48.182 --> 06:50.783
All right, so he could be
here in town?

06:50.850 --> 06:52.552
That's what we need
to find out.

06:52.619 --> 06:54.620
We have to assume
his organization was hired

06:54.688 --> 06:56.789
- to make it happen.
- Well, in my read,

06:56.856 --> 06:59.491
it looked like he might have
subcontracted out the work

06:59.559 --> 07:02.927
to someone in the ER,
like a local hit man.

07:02.995 --> 07:07.165
My thoughts exactly.
So... meet Dennis Falk.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.334
He popped out as the only one
in the ER that had

07:09.402 --> 07:11.803
a criminal record.
And what a record it is.

07:11.870 --> 07:15.005
Narcotics convictions,
assault, attempted murder.

07:15.073 --> 07:18.409
So, what's a guy like Couvreur
doing hiring a guy like Falk?

07:18.476 --> 07:20.611
Wouldn't you think he'd look
for a specialist?

07:20.679 --> 07:23.013
- He's our best bet so far.
- I'll text you his last

07:23.081 --> 07:25.316
known address. Meanwhile I'll
dig a little deeper on the rest

07:25.383 --> 07:27.384
- of the people in the ER.
- OK.

07:27.452 --> 07:31.787
If it's Oz,
I don't need to know, OK?

07:48.904 --> 07:51.640
Mr. Perrault?
Alvin Klein, IIB.

07:51.708 --> 07:54.443
This is my deputy minister,
Danielle Belanger,

07:54.510 --> 07:56.978
and you've met Damien,

07:57.046 --> 07:59.948
Police Nationale Lieutenant
and my Head of Security.

08:00.015 --> 08:02.617
How can, uh,
we help you, Mr. Klein?

08:02.684 --> 08:06.687
Sir, we've received information that
suggests your life might be in danger.

08:06.755 --> 08:09.022
My life has been in danger

08:09.090 --> 08:11.259
ever since I accepted
this position.

08:11.326 --> 08:13.361
What exactly have you heard?

08:13.428 --> 08:15.630
Unfortunately, the picture
isn't clear at the moment,

08:15.697 --> 08:17.798
but do you know a man
named Julien Couvreur?

08:17.866 --> 08:19.299
Of course I do.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.501
A dangerous man,
but a man on the run.

08:21.569 --> 08:25.105
He may be looking for revenge, or a
return to the French underworld.

08:25.173 --> 08:27.507
There is no reason Couvreur
would make this kind of play,

08:27.575 --> 08:31.044
and even if he tried,
we have set up ample protection.

08:31.112 --> 08:33.046
Still, he may not be
acting alone,

08:33.114 --> 08:35.282
and he may have been
planning this for a while.

08:35.316 --> 08:38.217
I'd like to attach some of
my people to your security team.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.020
We are happy to accept
your help, Mr. Klein.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.054
Mademoiselle Belanger...

08:43.123 --> 08:45.692
But you must understand they
will be under the direction

08:45.760 --> 08:48.227
of our staff.
For security reasons,

08:48.296 --> 08:50.496
Monsieur Perrault has kept
his itinerary top secret.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.498
We could help with the
planning of Monsieur Perrault's

08:52.565 --> 08:54.900
- movements within the city.
- Danielle is right.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.370
The secrecy of our activities outside of
the conference is our best protection.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.839
If you would still like
to offer your help,

09:00.907 --> 09:04.643
we would be more than happy
to accept under our terms.

09:06.239 --> 09:09.580
I'll have my office contact
your people. Thank you.

09:09.648 --> 09:11.248
Merci.

09:19.458 --> 09:23.794
<i>Hi, this is Michelle. Leave a message and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

09:23.861 --> 09:26.663
Michelle...

09:26.731 --> 09:29.232
I don't know
what more I can say.

09:31.436 --> 09:34.638
I know that the deal with Gaines
was a bad idea. I...

09:34.706 --> 09:36.707
I was doing it for us.

09:39.710 --> 09:42.511
And now there may not be an us.

09:42.579 --> 09:45.013
I want you to know he's not
an investor anymore, OK?

09:45.081 --> 09:47.149
I gave him his money back.
The club...

09:47.217 --> 09:49.452
will be whatever.
It's gonna be...

09:52.055 --> 09:53.756
I know...

09:53.824 --> 09:55.990
I know I don't have the right
to ask for another chance,

09:56.058 --> 09:58.092
but I'm doing it anyway.

10:12.173 --> 10:14.575
You gonna take that?

10:14.642 --> 10:16.142
No.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.111
When they were taking me
into the ER,

10:18.179 --> 10:21.047
I couldn't control my reads.
I read you thinking about Adam.

10:21.115 --> 10:23.550
Is it true?
Are you guys finished?

10:23.618 --> 10:26.453
I don't know. Some people just
aren't meant to be together.

10:41.135 --> 10:44.203
Falk? Hey!

10:58.151 --> 11:01.119
He's got a gun in the car,
Michelle!

11:01.186 --> 11:03.687
Ugh! What are you doin'? Yo!

11:03.755 --> 11:05.489
Get off me, man! Are you crazy?

11:05.557 --> 11:07.792
Toby! Check the car!

11:14.066 --> 11:16.533
There's a gun,
and there's this.

11:26.422 --> 11:29.290
<i>I'm not really up on the price
of cocaine these days, Dennis,</i>

11:29.358 --> 11:32.995
<i>but for you, it's looking like
it's gonna cost about seven years.</i>

11:33.062 --> 11:35.630
<i>I don't know how they got</i>
<i>there, and they're not mine.</i>

11:35.697 --> 11:38.566
You know what, let's start over, OK?
We're not interested in the drugs.

11:38.634 --> 11:40.568
What we're interested in is
who hired you

11:40.636 --> 11:42.670
- to kill Gerard Perrault.
- Who the hell is that?

11:42.738 --> 11:45.205
- Nobody hired me to kill anybody.
- So, you're not connected

11:45.273 --> 11:48.075
to a French national
named Julien Couvreur?

11:50.178 --> 11:52.579
<i>Look, I don't know</i>
<i>what's going on here,</i>

11:52.680 --> 11:55.015
<i>but I don't even know</i>
<i>any French people</i>

11:57.718 --> 12:01.588
Not gonna set me up for killing
<i>somebody. I'm not a hitter.</i>

12:01.656 --> 12:04.524
So, what were you doing
yesterday at the St. Luke's hospital?

12:04.592 --> 12:06.560
I was dropping
my boy Donny off.

12:06.627 --> 12:09.461
He broke his wrist
in a car door.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.798
Ugh!

12:12.866 --> 12:15.801
So, is your buddy Donny,
is he a hit man?

12:15.869 --> 12:18.537
Hey, man, what Donny does is
Donny's business.

12:18.605 --> 12:22.374
You know, this is not the kind of
cooperation that's gonna help you out here.

12:29.581 --> 12:33.784
Look, Donny does street sales, but
he hasn't done it in a while.

12:33.851 --> 12:37.153
He's got something on the go right
now, but he won't tell me about it.

12:37.221 --> 12:39.489
All I know is that
he's flush right now.

12:39.557 --> 12:42.258
Look, I'm giving you everything
I got. Cut me a break, man.

12:42.326 --> 12:45.061
You give us Donny's last name
and an address,

12:45.128 --> 12:47.496
and then we can talk
about your break, OK?

12:50.901 --> 12:54.103
OK, so, apparently Donny Stark
doesn't have a criminal record.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.205
That's why I didn't ID him
in the hospital video.

12:56.272 --> 12:59.809
He's either new to the game or he's smart
enough that he hasn't been caught yet.

12:59.876 --> 13:02.243
The Ministry of Transport
records show that he bought

13:02.311 --> 13:04.913
a $70,000 car in cash last week

13:04.981 --> 13:07.916
as well as putting a down
payment on a condo in cash.

13:07.984 --> 13:09.818
That sounds like professional-
hit-man money to me.

13:09.885 --> 13:12.549
He also travelled
to Mexico City last month,

13:12.669 --> 13:15.018
one of the places Couvreur was
rumoured to have been hiding.

13:15.138 --> 13:17.051
How are you doing with
the people that were in the ER?

13:17.171 --> 13:18.559
As far as I can tell,
everyone's clean.

13:18.627 --> 13:20.661
How about working it
from the justice minister's end?

13:20.729 --> 13:22.440
Any enemies who could
have ordered the hit?

13:22.560 --> 13:25.666
Perrault has taken down half of the
French underworld. He can't be frightened,

13:25.734 --> 13:27.876
and apparently
he can't be bought.

13:27.996 --> 13:30.155
The most likely suspects are
Le Vent de Mer,

13:30.275 --> 13:31.809
Marseille's most powerful gang.

13:31.929 --> 13:34.441
The leader is a man named
Daniel Spinelli. Nightclubs,

13:34.509 --> 13:36.743
drugs, prostitution,
you name it.

13:36.810 --> 13:38.878
Perrault took him and most
of his lieutenants down on

13:38.946 --> 13:41.881
racketeering charges last fall.
Their trials are coming up.

13:41.949 --> 13:45.018
This would be a great time to
take out the justice minister.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.086
That would discourage them from trying
to convict these guys.

13:47.206 --> 13:50.535
In the meantime, let's try to find
Donny Stark and see if his newfound wealth

13:50.655 --> 13:52.158
is courtesy
of a French connection.

13:52.225 --> 13:54.924
- Toby.
- Yeah.

13:55.044 --> 13:57.329
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.

13:57.397 --> 13:59.931
The official report from
the SIU hasn't come in yet,

13:59.999 --> 14:03.202
but they were concerned about how
the shooting is affecting you.

14:03.270 --> 14:06.737
They want a clean bill of health
from a psychologist.

14:06.805 --> 14:09.907
It's standard procedure for any
officer who's gone through this.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.743
Can it wait? 'Cause we're
less than 12 hours away

14:12.811 --> 14:15.980
- from this hit going down.
- Dr. Gray is a good person

14:16.048 --> 14:18.416
to talk to. She understands
what you're going through.

14:18.484 --> 14:21.718
Oh, yeah? Who'd she kill?

14:21.786 --> 14:23.720
She's helped
half the department.

14:23.788 --> 14:25.922
It's not open
for a discussion, Toby.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.024
She's expecting you.

14:31.729 --> 14:34.030
Toby, I understand
that you spent a number of years

14:34.098 --> 14:36.533
- as a paramedic.
- Yeah, seven years.

14:36.601 --> 14:38.568
Sorry, can I move this
over here?

14:38.635 --> 14:41.904
- Please, make yourself comfortable.
- Thanks.

14:41.971 --> 14:44.307
So, you're no stranger
to seeing death.

14:44.374 --> 14:48.091
No, unfortunately not.
However, I'm learning

14:48.211 --> 14:50.412
that it's very different when
you're the one who caused it.

14:50.479 --> 14:52.380
There's no doubt.

14:52.448 --> 14:54.149
Mmhmm.

14:54.217 --> 14:56.818
Toby, when you were
a paramedic,

14:56.885 --> 15:00.555
would you characterize yourself
as an empathetic person?

15:00.623 --> 15:03.258
Yeah.

15:03.326 --> 15:05.704
I mean, I understand
what people are going through.

15:05.824 --> 15:10.797
So then it must have been particularly hard
for someone like you to have taken a life.

15:10.865 --> 15:13.100
Yes.

15:15.570 --> 15:17.938
Do you want to tell me
about the shooting?

15:18.005 --> 15:19.540
Do we have to do this?

15:19.608 --> 15:21.542
It will help.

15:21.610 --> 15:23.544
Promise.

15:23.612 --> 15:25.279
Please.

15:25.347 --> 15:29.616
The guy who shot me in the arm
was about to shoot my partner,

15:29.683 --> 15:33.253
so I yelled for him
to drop his weapon.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.088
I guess I just expected
that he would drop his weapon.

15:36.156 --> 15:38.258
- But he didn't?
- He turned.

15:38.325 --> 15:42.761
He was about to point his weapon
at me, so I shot him.

15:42.828 --> 15:44.929
And how did you feel
in that moment?

15:49.902 --> 15:52.404
You find yourself re-living it,
don't you?

15:52.472 --> 15:57.676
That's common. Most people that have
post-traumatic stress disorder, they do.

15:57.744 --> 15:59.778
I'm not like most people here,
Doctor.

15:59.812 --> 16:02.147
I'm inside the guy's head

16:02.214 --> 16:04.682
and I can see myself
shooting him.

16:07.153 --> 16:09.087
Are most people like that?

16:09.155 --> 16:13.992
I think that when you relive
a traumatic event this strongly,

16:14.059 --> 16:16.760
it's important
to distance yourself.

16:16.828 --> 16:21.198
I have seen things
that no one will ever see.

16:21.266 --> 16:24.668
- On the job...
- Before the job. My whole life.

16:26.671 --> 16:29.006
And I thought that this job
would make

16:29.073 --> 16:31.574
everything that I've seen
make sense.

16:32.942 --> 16:37.681
But not just... I look at what
I've been doing, running around,

16:37.748 --> 16:40.350
playing cop with no gun.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.087
Being a hero, like...

16:45.155 --> 16:47.923
And now I shoot someone,
I kill somebody, and...

16:47.990 --> 16:52.227
and it all becomes very real.

16:52.295 --> 16:56.231
There are other therapies
that might be of help. Some medications...

16:56.299 --> 16:58.233
OK, look, the drugs aren't
gonna work.

16:58.301 --> 17:01.102
And I... you've got a job,

17:01.170 --> 17:03.571
and I appreciate you doing
what you're doing here...

17:05.607 --> 17:09.143
but it's best if I just deal
with this on my own.

17:09.211 --> 17:10.811
It's what I have to do.

17:10.878 --> 17:14.114
Toby, it's not
what you have to do.

17:14.182 --> 17:18.152
You realize that if you were
a tactical officer,

17:18.220 --> 17:20.420
I wouldn't let you
back into service.

17:20.488 --> 17:22.823
But in your case, I don't think

17:22.890 --> 17:25.358
that relieving you of your duty
is what you need.

17:25.425 --> 17:28.762
I think that you continuing
to work with your unit,

17:28.830 --> 17:31.398
it might help normalize things
for you.

17:31.466 --> 17:33.667
So, I guess you'll
just tell my boss that I'm OK

17:33.735 --> 17:36.369
and... I can get back to work.

17:36.436 --> 17:39.538
Toby, please just be
honest with yourself,

17:39.606 --> 17:42.107
and don't let this get
so far away from you

17:42.175 --> 17:44.042
that you endanger yourself

17:44.110 --> 17:47.179
or your partner.
And if you want to talk,

17:47.247 --> 17:49.682
my number is on the card,
and you can reach me anytime.

17:49.750 --> 17:52.216
All right. Thank you.

18:00.025 --> 18:01.485
- Michelle.
- Yeah.

18:01.605 --> 18:04.295
I think I might have turned up
a location on Donny Stark.

18:04.363 --> 18:07.598
Apparently he likes to deal drugs
out of a cafe in the east side.

18:07.665 --> 18:09.700
So, how does he go from being
a dealer to a hit man?

18:09.768 --> 18:11.516
You'll have to ask him
yourself. I'll tell Toby

18:11.636 --> 18:14.738
- you'll pick him up on the way.
- OK.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.810
There ya go, there ya go.
You need anything else?

18:19.878 --> 18:22.178
- No, that's all I need.
- Later.

18:27.050 --> 18:29.419
Stay back.
I'm gonna cut him off.

18:55.644 --> 18:57.678
- Get out of my way.
- Give me the gun.

18:57.746 --> 18:58.979
- Move!
- No, no, come on.

18:59.047 --> 19:01.081
- Stay the hell away from me. I'll do it.
- Go ahead.

19:01.201 --> 19:01.915
I'll do it!

19:02.035 --> 19:03.984
It's not gonna change
anything. Do it. Do it.

19:04.052 --> 19:05.786
Go ahead. Give it to me.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.288
Drop it! Drop your weapon now!

19:08.356 --> 19:12.124
- On the ground.
- Put it down now!

19:12.192 --> 19:14.193
You know, this could have been
a conversation,

19:14.261 --> 19:16.696
but you just amped it up
to assaulting an officer.

19:23.070 --> 19:25.972
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I was trying to stop him.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.541
You could have got
yourself killed. Toby.

19:29.609 --> 19:33.645
Look, I don't know what I'm
doing, OK? I can't do this.

19:45.547 --> 19:47.781
Tell us about Julien Couvreur.

19:47.849 --> 19:50.318
You tell me.
Never heard of him.

19:50.385 --> 19:52.619
We understand
you're working for him.

19:53.137 --> 19:55.170
How am I gonna work for a guy
I never heard of?

19:55.238 --> 19:58.107
I don't think you understand the kind
trouble that you're in here, OK?

19:58.174 --> 20:01.043
Unlicensed weapon, assaulting an
officer, not to mention the three

20:01.111 --> 20:04.213
kilos of coke that we found
in your apartment and your car.

20:04.281 --> 20:05.715
Those weren't mine.

20:05.783 --> 20:07.950
Look, we can talk
about this all day,

20:08.018 --> 20:10.720
but it still doesn't mean
I know a guy that I don't know.

20:10.788 --> 20:13.522
We need to know your whereabouts
for the last 24 hours.

20:13.589 --> 20:16.825
I was with my girl.
No one else.

20:16.893 --> 20:19.061
She can tell you.

20:19.129 --> 20:21.297
She can also tell you
what we were doing,

20:21.364 --> 20:23.365
if that's what you get off on.

20:23.433 --> 20:26.501
Then my buddy came by and we went to
go pick up something a guy owed me.

20:26.569 --> 20:28.469
Is that how you broke
your hand?

20:28.537 --> 20:32.206
That's right. And then
I went to the hospital.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.409
You know everything,
why you asking me?

20:34.476 --> 20:36.444
Well, we also have reason
to believe that you've been

20:36.511 --> 20:38.746
taking on contract killings
recently.

20:41.016 --> 20:42.550
What?

20:47.956 --> 20:51.258
How did this go from dealing
some dope to killing people?

20:54.228 --> 20:57.897
Look, I've been moving
up the supply chain.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.498
You want to deal?

20:59.566 --> 21:02.234
I could deal you some of the big
boys I've been buying from.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.338
But I got nothing to do
with killings.

21:07.574 --> 21:09.842
- Hey.
- Well?

21:09.909 --> 21:11.382
Well, he says that he was
with his girlfriend

21:11.502 --> 21:12.625
and Falk right up until
they went to the hospital.

21:12.745 --> 21:14.746
I'll check if the girlfriend
corroborates his story.

21:14.814 --> 21:17.849
- Now what's going on with Toby?
- I've left him several messages,

21:17.916 --> 21:20.685
but I really think the shooting affected
him a lot more than he's letting on.

21:20.752 --> 21:23.554
Well, it's still fresh.
Maybe he just needs some space.

21:23.622 --> 21:25.756
In the meantime, we have
less than eight hours

21:25.824 --> 21:27.959
before this
assassination attempt.

21:28.027 --> 21:30.828
Check out Donny's alibi and keep
working this Marseille connection.

21:30.896 --> 21:33.130
There's gotta be someone in town
with a hookup.

21:37.102 --> 21:39.569
Yeah, it's gonna heal nicely.

21:39.637 --> 21:42.973
There might be a bit of a scar, but that
would do wonders for your street cred.

21:43.041 --> 21:47.076
Yeah, I'm not really that concerned
with my street cred anymore.

21:47.144 --> 21:50.246
- Seriously, are you OK?
- Yeah.

21:50.314 --> 21:54.050
- Hey.
- Hey. Is my little

21:54.118 --> 21:56.052
angel of mercy
taking good care of you?

21:56.120 --> 21:58.187
She is. She's the best.
Are you kidding me?

21:58.255 --> 22:00.256
- Take care.
- I will.

22:00.324 --> 22:03.858
Kissing in front of me.

22:03.926 --> 22:06.259
It was a little peck. Come on.
You all patched up?

22:06.379 --> 22:07.110
Yeah.

22:07.230 --> 22:09.864
Yeah? you ready
to head back to the office?

22:09.932 --> 22:12.401
I don't know
if I can do it anymore.

22:12.468 --> 22:15.404
I thought
I could handle it, man.

22:15.471 --> 22:18.173
- I'm finding out that I'm not like them.
- Toby, what are you talking about?

22:18.241 --> 22:21.375
When I shot this guy,
I was inside his head.

22:21.443 --> 22:24.878
I could see myself
shooting him.

22:24.946 --> 22:27.314
So it's like I'm...

22:29.317 --> 22:32.886
seeing a murder
that I committed

22:32.954 --> 22:35.221
through the victim's eyes.

22:37.191 --> 22:39.125
I felt his pain,

22:39.193 --> 22:41.094
his fear...

22:41.162 --> 22:43.096
You did what you had to do.

22:43.164 --> 22:45.898
Today, a guy had a gun on me,

22:45.966 --> 22:49.536
and I kept walking towards him
like it was nothing.

22:49.603 --> 22:51.636
I told him, "Go ahead".

22:54.441 --> 22:56.741
- That's not good.
- Have you talked to Michelle

22:56.809 --> 23:00.512
about this? Don't they give you a police
shrink for this sort of situation?

23:00.580 --> 23:02.881
- I've only told you.
- Well, I'm flattered, Toby,

23:02.949 --> 23:04.804
but you should talk to
somebody over there.

23:04.924 --> 23:07.618
I'm gonna figure this out.
I always do.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.621
<i>I finally got in touch</i>
<i>with a cop</i>

23:10.689 --> 23:13.191
from the Police Nationale
who was an expert on Couvreur.

23:13.258 --> 23:16.194
He gave me the name of one of his known
associates from a few years back,

23:16.261 --> 23:19.630
a Nicholas D'Angelo. Couvreur was even
married to this guy's sister for a while.

23:19.698 --> 23:22.166
- Keeping it in the family...
- D'Angelo helped Couvreur move

23:22.234 --> 23:25.803
some of his money offshore.
He moved to Canada in '06.

23:25.870 --> 23:28.371
he had
connections to Spinelli and

23:28.439 --> 23:31.241
the Vent de Mer crime family. Do
we have an address for D'Angelo?

23:31.309 --> 23:33.811
Yeah. He runs an import/
export business right in town.

23:33.878 --> 23:35.846
OK, let's bring this guy in
and sweat him.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.982
A guy like this has secrets.
No matter how smart he is,

23:38.049 --> 23:39.682
there's a loose end somewhere,
and we need leverage.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.484
Time's running out, kids.

23:41.551 --> 23:43.820
Michelle.

23:43.887 --> 23:47.456
- You good?
- Yeah. Just a lot going on.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.797
<i>One unheard</i>
<i>message.</i>

23:54.865 --> 23:59.602
<i>Michelle. I don't know</i>
<i>what more I can say.</i>

23:59.669 --> 24:01.703
<i>I know that the deal with
Gaines was a bad idea.</i>

24:01.771 --> 24:03.805
<i>I... I was doing it for us.</i>

24:36.705 --> 24:39.006
<i>This is Tia. Leave me your</i>
<i>name and number at the beep.</i>

24:39.074 --> 24:43.510
Hey, uh...

24:43.578 --> 24:46.746
Tia. Um...

24:46.814 --> 24:49.849
look, something happened to me,
and, uh...

24:49.917 --> 24:55.188
I would just love
to talk to you, just...

24:55.255 --> 24:57.657
just for a minute.

25:05.031 --> 25:08.433
I really don't know what it's going to take
to convince you I'm an honest businessman.

25:08.501 --> 25:10.435
Well, we'd like to ask you
about one of your old

25:10.503 --> 25:12.671
business associates,
Julien Couvreur.

25:12.739 --> 25:14.606
I met him in passing
back in France.

25:14.674 --> 25:16.541
He was your brother-in-law.

25:16.609 --> 25:19.010
My sister divorced him,
and after I found out

25:19.078 --> 25:22.261
what kind of activities he was
involved in, I broke off all ties.

25:22.381 --> 25:24.716
We have reason to believe
that he's here in Canada now.

25:24.783 --> 25:27.051
We also think that it may have
been you who brought him in.

25:27.119 --> 25:29.921
Any further conversations will
be done through my lawyers.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.856
I'm afraid
this interview is over.

25:31.924 --> 25:36.393
And I'm afraid not.
Your ex-wife,

25:36.461 --> 25:39.697
Christine, has secured
an international warrant for you

25:39.764 --> 25:43.900
for failure to pay child support
to the tune of $300,000.

25:43.968 --> 25:46.837
And since when does the IIB concern
itself with foreign marital conflicts?

25:46.904 --> 25:49.706
Since we found out that
your old friend Couvreur is

25:49.773 --> 25:52.007
planning to murder someone
within the next five hours,

25:52.075 --> 25:53.943
so if you know where he is
or where to find him,

25:54.010 --> 25:55.978
now would be a good time
to talk.

25:56.046 --> 25:58.615
My lawyers will have me
out of here in an hour.

26:08.824 --> 26:10.325
Hey.

26:10.393 --> 26:12.394
Your receptionist wasn't
out front, so...

26:12.462 --> 26:13.928
Well, my... I mean,

26:13.996 --> 26:15.930
my appointment hours are over
for the day,

26:15.998 --> 26:18.567
but I, uh, I have some time.

26:18.635 --> 26:21.569
I'm glad you came back.
Please, have a seat.

26:25.039 --> 26:27.441
So, how are you feeling?

26:27.509 --> 26:30.378
I think you were right
about me being empathetic.

26:32.281 --> 26:35.983
I think it's why I'm good
at what I do with the IIB.

26:36.050 --> 26:39.919
Ever since I was young, I've...

26:39.987 --> 26:42.422
I've seen inside
other people's heads.

26:42.490 --> 26:44.791
You have a sensitivity.

26:44.858 --> 26:46.293
It's like intuition.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.462
And it was tough
when I was a kid 'cause...

26:49.530 --> 26:51.665
maybe I wasn't the coolest kid,

26:51.732 --> 26:55.233
and I knew what they were
thinking about me.

26:55.302 --> 26:59.204
- It must be hard to feel that way.
- Yeah, it was.

27:02.008 --> 27:04.677
Something like...
the other night happens.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.947
And I kill this guy.

27:13.585 --> 27:17.622
I was just... near him
when he died.

27:19.925 --> 27:23.861
And I could see myself
the way that he saw me.

27:26.764 --> 27:28.298
As a killer.

27:30.768 --> 27:34.137
I'm trying to figure out
if that's who I am,

27:34.205 --> 27:37.474
or if...

27:37.542 --> 27:40.076
that's who he thought I was.

27:42.579 --> 27:46.816
My whole life I've been trying
to separate that,

27:46.883 --> 27:50.753
separate who I know I am
from...

27:53.056 --> 27:55.090
what people think I am.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.093
And then this happens.

28:01.063 --> 28:03.097
And I'm lost.

28:05.835 --> 28:07.802
We all feel that
to a certain extent.

28:07.870 --> 28:11.840
I mean, clearly
you more than others.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.541
But ultimately, Toby,

28:14.609 --> 28:18.379
who and what you are...
is a choice,

28:18.446 --> 28:23.450
and you chose in that instance
to save your partner's life,

28:23.518 --> 28:27.888
and you can choose to define
yourself by killing one person

28:27.955 --> 28:31.924
or by saving another.

28:31.992 --> 28:35.361
Now, your partnership

28:35.429 --> 28:37.697
with Sergeant McCluskey,

28:37.765 --> 28:39.699
it's important to you?

28:39.767 --> 28:42.268
Very important.

28:42.335 --> 28:45.571
She's the one who gave me
this opportunity with the IIB.

28:48.074 --> 28:50.475
She's a friend.
Well, then

28:50.543 --> 28:54.578
choose to see yourself
as she would see you.

28:54.646 --> 28:56.580
You saved her life.

28:56.648 --> 28:59.683
You are a hero.

28:59.751 --> 29:01.986
And let that be the anchor.

29:02.054 --> 29:03.988
It could be the thing

29:04.056 --> 29:07.825
that pulls you through this pain
that you're feeling.

29:07.893 --> 29:11.094
And don't cut that part
of your life out.

29:16.292 --> 29:19.227
D'Angelo's right. Even if we could get
extradition charges into play here,

29:19.295 --> 29:21.606
his lawyer will get him out
on bail by the end of the day.

29:21.726 --> 29:23.087
That's why he's so cocky.

29:23.207 --> 29:25.166
I ran his phone and internet
records. There's no connection

29:25.234 --> 29:27.102
to Couvreur
or even a hint of crime.

29:27.169 --> 29:29.037
That doesn't mean
that he's clean.

29:29.105 --> 29:31.072
- It just means that he's smart.
- So that's it?

29:31.140 --> 29:33.073
The minister won't let us in
on his agenda

29:33.141 --> 29:34.975
and we can't set up
a proper security perimeter.

29:35.043 --> 29:37.545
We don't know when or where
this hit is gonna happen.

29:37.613 --> 29:40.448
No. Our only way in is D'Angelo, and
he's not gonna give us anything.

29:40.516 --> 29:42.784
That might not be
entirely true.

29:47.022 --> 29:49.411
- Hey.
- Hey. You OK?

29:49.531 --> 29:50.224
Yeah.

29:50.344 --> 29:52.158
You just come back
to clean out your desk?

29:52.226 --> 29:54.834
Nah, you kidding? We've got what,
like a couple of hours

29:54.954 --> 29:56.574
before we can stop this thing?

29:57.865 --> 30:00.366
We're a team.
We can do it, right?

30:00.435 --> 30:02.836
All right, let's bring you
up to speed.

30:02.904 --> 30:04.904
Welcome back.

30:07.841 --> 30:10.910
I thought we established I
wasn't speaking to you anymore.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.011
- That was before.
- Before what?

30:13.079 --> 30:15.848
Before we knew how you got
Couvreur into the country.

30:15.916 --> 30:18.551
<i>Can't know about </i> The Marlin.
<i>Trust Cady to screw it up.</i>

30:18.618 --> 30:20.952
Cady told us
all about <i>The Marlin</i>

30:21.019 --> 30:24.322
- and how you set it all up.
- Where are you getting this stuff?

30:24.389 --> 30:27.091
<i>Nothing to tie me to him.</i>
<i>Nobody at the dock.</i>

30:27.159 --> 30:29.393
<i>The Marlin</i> is a boat.
Your fingerprints are

30:29.462 --> 30:31.362
all over it,
along with Couvreur's.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.164
Do you have any idea how much
trouble you could be in

30:33.231 --> 30:35.466
for transporting a fugitive
into the country?

30:35.533 --> 30:38.635
Not to mention how much worse it's gonna get
for you if he actually carries out the hit.

30:43.808 --> 30:46.577
- What do you want?
- We want Couvreur's location.

30:46.644 --> 30:49.179
- I don't know that.
- I thought we were past this.

30:49.246 --> 30:52.181
I'm telling the truth.
I brought him into the country.

30:52.248 --> 30:54.183
I didn't want to,
but he called in an old favour.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.218
When he got here,
I didn't want to know

30:56.286 --> 30:58.287
anything he was involved in.
I didn't want any part of it.

30:58.355 --> 31:01.256
- When was the last time you saw him?
- I brought him to a safe house.

31:01.324 --> 31:03.559
I went back there the next day
for payment.

31:03.627 --> 31:07.029
He has other contacts, and
the next day he was moving on.

31:07.097 --> 31:09.698
One of them must die.
I don't care which one!

31:09.765 --> 31:11.566
You choose!

31:14.303 --> 31:16.872
So, you have no idea
who he hired to do the hit?

31:16.939 --> 31:20.509
I heard him talking on the phone
to someone. I don't know who.

31:26.515 --> 31:29.683
<i>I sent a team to the safe house
where D'Angelo saw Couvreur.</i>

31:29.751 --> 31:32.419
They said it was empty and
it was wiped down. This guy's a ghost.

31:32.487 --> 31:34.421
D'Angelo saw Couvreur
on a phone

31:34.489 --> 31:36.857
saying that someone would die
if Perrault wasn't killed.

31:36.925 --> 31:38.893
Maybe he's got a hostage.
Let's go back to the hospital

31:38.960 --> 31:40.860
and talk to everyone who was
in the waiting room again.

31:40.928 --> 31:42.996
OK, wait. I might be able
to narrow this down, guys.

31:45.866 --> 31:49.335
This is a traffic cam image from
across the street from the safe house.

31:49.403 --> 31:51.303
It looks like Couvreur left
with a boy.

31:51.371 --> 31:53.172
We need to find out
who that boy is.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.174
Our people who are shadowing
the French security team

31:55.242 --> 31:58.677
just reported that Perrault is
on his way to St. Luke's.

31:58.745 --> 32:00.879
- Is he ill?
- I read Couvreur saying

32:00.947 --> 32:02.948
that Perrault's weakness was
his strength.

32:03.016 --> 32:05.551
- Maybe he knew he was sick.
- Could mean that whoever Couvreur is

32:05.618 --> 32:08.053
coercing to kill Perrault is
still at that hospital.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.656
If his security was so tight, then how would
Couvreur have known where to make the hit?

32:11.723 --> 32:13.891
It could be a leak
coming from his own operation.

32:13.959 --> 32:16.827
I'll get onto French intelligence and
have them run phone and banking records

32:16.895 --> 32:18.462
for all the people
that work for Perrault.

32:18.582 --> 32:20.249
If someone made a deal
they might have left a trail.

32:20.369 --> 32:23.067
We'll check in
from the hospital. Let's go.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.173
Hey. We need some help.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.909
- What can we do?
- You guys admitted a patient,

32:32.977 --> 32:36.412
- a French politician named Perrault.
- He's not on the books.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.082
Sandy, this is very important.
The guy's life is at risk.

32:39.149 --> 32:41.484
Toby, patient information is
privileged. This patient's info

32:41.552 --> 32:43.453
is top secret.
I only found out an hour ago.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.520
We believe that
an assassination is going to be

32:45.589 --> 32:48.891
attempted at this hospital. Now, we can
get a warrant, but every minute counts.

32:50.894 --> 32:52.695
OK.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.229
Thank you.

32:56.399 --> 32:58.300
Perrault has
early onset Parkinson's.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.802
He came in for a deep brain
stimulus operation.

33:00.869 --> 33:03.537
It's basically a pacemaker
for the nervous system

33:03.606 --> 33:06.641
to stop the tremors. Dr. Cramer
is a world specialist.

33:06.709 --> 33:08.810
OK, so he comes here
to get the operation,

33:08.877 --> 33:10.812
his enemies don't know
his weakness.

33:10.879 --> 33:13.848
He dies on the operating table,
complications from surgery.

33:13.916 --> 33:16.382
Does Dr. Cramer have any kids?
Yeah, two girls.

33:16.450 --> 33:18.518
One's in college.
We're looking for someone

33:18.586 --> 33:20.754
on the operating team who has
a boy, maybe about 10 years old,

33:20.822 --> 33:23.790
brown hair...
Oh, Dr. Jillian Sisley,

33:23.858 --> 33:26.858
the anaesthesiologist.
She has a young son, Jeff.

33:27.478 --> 33:29.462
I read Couvreur saying
"one shot".

33:29.530 --> 33:32.564
Maybe it's not a gunshot.
It's a sedation.

33:32.632 --> 33:35.601
He's making Dr. Sisley
overdose Perrault.

33:35.668 --> 33:37.969
Accidental death
by anaesthesia can happen.

33:38.037 --> 33:39.618
It wouldn't be that hard to adjust
the amount of medication.

33:39.738 --> 33:41.054
What's the operating room Sandy?

33:41.174 --> 33:42.707
OR number three.
It starts in a few minutes.

33:42.775 --> 33:45.244
- OK, let's go.
- Can Toby go alone, please?

33:45.311 --> 33:48.046
It's just, we don't want to arouse any
more suspicion. You know what I mean?

33:48.114 --> 33:50.448
- Yeah. Go.
- I got it.

33:54.453 --> 33:56.320
Hey, Dr. Sisley.
Hey, how are you?

33:56.388 --> 33:59.423
Good. I hope
your wound is healing.

33:59.491 --> 34:01.392
Looks like you've got
an important operation here.

34:01.460 --> 34:03.294
I suppose so. It's not something
I can really talk about.

34:03.362 --> 34:06.964
- I'm sure you'll do the right thing.
- I try.

34:07.032 --> 34:10.768
They can't be removed,
so I will know what you say.

34:10.835 --> 34:13.871
I will know what you do.
If you don't do as I say,

34:13.938 --> 34:16.438
your son will die.

34:19.476 --> 34:22.210
You're right.
This is gonna heal really well.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.953
What did you find out?

34:31.021 --> 34:33.889
She just went into the OR.
Hey, Oz?

34:34.010 --> 34:34.885
Yeah? Excuse me. Yes.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.824
I need you to give
a note to Dr. Sisley, OK?

34:36.945 --> 34:37.862
You need me to take the note?

34:37.983 --> 34:39.728
It's gonna let her know that
we're going to save her son.

34:39.795 --> 34:41.864
She just has to stall the
operation a bit.

34:41.984 --> 34:42.745
OK.

34:42.864 --> 34:45.734
- Make sure she reads that.
- Done.

34:45.802 --> 34:47.969
Couvreur's got her wired.
If she tries to say anything,

34:48.036 --> 34:50.672
stop the operation,
he's going to kill her son.

34:50.739 --> 34:53.407
Yeah, but if we don't,
the justice minister dies.

34:53.474 --> 34:55.641
You got this.

35:05.924 --> 35:07.212
It's OK,

35:07.494 --> 35:08.870
I'm the director
of Emergency Services.

35:08.990 --> 35:10.699
I need to give this
to Dr. Sisley.

35:10.819 --> 35:14.215
There is a sensitive surgery
being performed.

35:14.335 --> 35:16.146
- This isn't the time.
- Look, this is the patient's

35:16.266 --> 35:19.536
toxicology report, so the operation
won't start until the doctor sees this.

35:19.656 --> 35:22.262
We can't take chances.

35:22.382 --> 35:24.368
It's a procedural thing.

35:24.496 --> 35:25.877
Oz, what's this about?

35:25.944 --> 35:28.779
Oh, we've got the patient's
updated tox report.

35:28.847 --> 35:30.781
No, no, that's OK,
I've already studied this.

35:30.849 --> 35:32.750
- I have to get back.
- Actually, this is

35:32.818 --> 35:35.052
some new information. I think
this is pretty important.

35:38.724 --> 35:40.657
I just thought you should know.

35:40.725 --> 35:43.059
Thank you.

35:46.413 --> 35:48.207
So, my theory is that
the earrings they have on her

35:48.327 --> 35:51.401
are too small to be a cellular-based device,
so they gotta be WiFi and broadcasting over

35:51.521 --> 35:52.483
the hospital's internet gateway.

35:52.603 --> 35:55.909
Those are all the connections going
to the router closest to the OR.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.874
OK, there's hundreds out them.
How are we gonna know which one?

35:57.942 --> 36:01.511
All devices use a discrete
identifier like an ESN number

36:01.579 --> 36:04.848
or a MAC address. We just have
to find an atypical signature.

36:04.916 --> 36:07.651
OK, look. Whatever that is,
the hardware is unrecognized.

36:07.718 --> 36:10.153
That's gotta be our signal.
Now we've just got to find out

36:10.220 --> 36:12.922
who accessing that
over the internet. OK, got it.

36:12.989 --> 36:14.890
Look, the IP is registered
to a Chinese restaurant

36:14.958 --> 36:17.593
on Queen Street West. It's like
five minutes from here.

36:17.661 --> 36:21.430
- All right. Get SWAT to meet us there.
- Got it.

36:24.434 --> 36:26.635
If you're ready, Dr. Sisley,
maybe we can proceed.

36:26.703 --> 36:29.236
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need
a few minutes.

36:29.304 --> 36:31.973
I have to change the canisters.

36:32.041 --> 36:34.008
Isoflurane was recommended,
but I've just been advised

36:34.076 --> 36:36.611
that the patient has
an irregular heartbeat.

36:36.679 --> 36:39.180
We're on a tight schedule,
Doctor. Proceed quickly.

36:39.247 --> 36:40.748
Of course.

36:52.193 --> 36:53.660
You OK?

36:53.728 --> 36:55.161
Let's do this.

36:55.229 --> 36:57.497
- When we move, we move fast.
- Mm-hmm.

36:57.565 --> 36:59.599
Copy that.
Let's go.

37:05.639 --> 37:07.573
Out of the way.

37:09.643 --> 37:11.176
Shh! Shh!

37:11.244 --> 37:13.679
- Stay calm. Stay calm.
- Jesus.

37:13.747 --> 37:16.147
It's OK, it's OK.
Stay calm, stay calm.

37:35.700 --> 37:37.961
<i>Ready when you are, Doctor.</i>

37:38.081 --> 37:39.843
<i>One more minute. I need to
balance the oxygen ratio.</i>

37:39.963 --> 37:41.905
Go!

37:41.973 --> 37:44.041
- Ugh!
- On the ground! Now!

37:44.109 --> 37:46.343
Everyone on the ground!

37:46.410 --> 37:50.946
Hey. You OK? Come on. Your mom's
gonna be happy to see you.

37:52.449 --> 37:56.412
Dev, tell Jillian we have the boy.
Someone else can do the surgery.

38:03.493 --> 38:05.627
Who told you
about Perrault's operation?

38:05.695 --> 38:08.563
You want to make a deal,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

38:08.631 --> 38:10.565
When and where?

38:10.633 --> 38:14.569
St. Luke's, Thursday, 6pm.

38:14.637 --> 38:17.238
No. There's no deal.

38:22.510 --> 38:24.444
It's Perrault's deputy minister.

38:24.512 --> 38:26.313
Let's get Dev on it.

38:35.790 --> 38:37.757
It turns out

38:37.825 --> 38:39.759
Mademoiselle Belanger was
in line to take over

38:39.827 --> 38:41.961
from Perrault should he
not be able to continue.

38:42.029 --> 38:45.765
They found millions of euros in an offshore
bank account registered in her name,

38:45.833 --> 38:47.896
and that was only the beginning of

38:48.016 --> 38:49.426
lucrative relationship
with the Marseille gang.

38:49.546 --> 38:51.504
All she had to do was sell out
her boss and get him killed.

38:51.572 --> 38:53.438
Dr. Sisley got her son back,

38:53.506 --> 38:56.108
we took down a few
high-level drug dealers,

38:56.176 --> 38:58.744
a criminal
on INTERPOL's hit list.

38:59.412 --> 39:00.912
It's not a bad day.

39:00.979 --> 39:03.348
My thoughts exactly, which is
why I'd like to take you out

39:03.416 --> 39:05.883
for an exquisite meal
and even better wine.

39:05.951 --> 39:09.353
I'm gonna pass. I'm gonna
go home, get some rest.

39:09.421 --> 39:11.755
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

39:11.823 --> 39:14.191
- Good to have you back, Toby.
- Thanks.

39:14.258 --> 39:15.693
On that note,

39:15.760 --> 39:17.695
I have to go as well.

39:17.762 --> 39:20.531
There's something I have
to take care of. Have fun.

39:25.669 --> 39:28.705
Well, they don't know what they're
missing, but I guess it's just you and me.

39:28.772 --> 39:31.507

like we're dating.

Hey, hi.

40:31.631 --> 40:34.032
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, no, of course.

40:40.072 --> 40:43.509
- You look amaz...
- I got your messa...

40:43.576 --> 40:46.310
- Go. Sorry.
- I got your message

40:46.430 --> 40:47.458
and I was worried about you.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.413
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left that.

40:49.533 --> 40:52.316
It was a bit heavy, and...

40:57.623 --> 40:59.757
I shot and killed a guy.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.498
I was having a great time
with you.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.669
And I didn't want to ruin it,

41:12.737 --> 41:16.172
and I regret now that I wasn't
honest with you sooner.

41:20.243 --> 41:23.211
You know, when you told me,
it was partly

41:23.279 --> 41:26.048
that I was mad that you hadn't
trusted me earlier,

41:26.115 --> 41:28.551
but mostly...

41:28.618 --> 41:31.320
I just couldn't process it.

41:33.288 --> 41:36.691
I'm still trying to figure out
how to process it.

41:40.095 --> 41:42.029
I'm sorry I shut you out, Toby.

41:42.097 --> 41:44.332
No, no. Don't be sorry.

41:44.399 --> 41:48.402
And if...
if you're up for it,

41:48.470 --> 41:51.204
I'd...

41:51.272 --> 41:53.974
like a chance to try again.

41:56.945 --> 41:59.813
Yeah. I'm up for it.

42:01.783 --> 42:04.250
There's just one thing
we need to do first.

42:04.318 --> 42:06.385
Anything.

42:06.453 --> 42:09.388
You were so scared

42:09.456 --> 42:11.724
that if you could read me,

42:11.792 --> 42:14.927
then our relationship would be
doomed. Remember?

42:14.995 --> 42:17.129
I don't know if I used
those words exactly.

42:17.197 --> 42:19.866
- Exactly those words.
- OK, I probably did.

42:23.068 --> 42:24.669
Well, I don't believe that,

42:24.737 --> 42:27.973
so two weeks ago
I went off my epilepsy meds.

42:28.040 --> 42:31.109
- Tia...
- I want you to try to read me.

42:31.176 --> 42:33.578
Right now?

42:33.646 --> 42:35.580
Look, if you can't,
then it's safe.

42:35.648 --> 42:37.080
And if you can,

42:37.148 --> 42:39.650
we'll figure it out from there.

42:39.718 --> 42:41.619
OK.

42:41.686 --> 42:45.122
Just a sec, all right?

42:45.189 --> 42:48.559
OK, now. Do you have
to do that to read?

42:48.627 --> 42:51.361
I don't have to do that, no.

42:51.429 --> 42:53.830

42:53.898 --> 42:57.266
