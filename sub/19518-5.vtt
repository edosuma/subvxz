WEBVTT

00:02.211 --> 00:03.644
A man gave this to you?

00:03.680 --> 00:05.413
I was looking at driver.
As your riddler?

00:05.448 --> 00:06.814
It wasn't him.

00:10.486 --> 00:12.153
It all stopped when sandy died.

00:12.188 --> 00:14.455
Her friend took her away. Who?

00:14.490 --> 00:15.890
He said you took away
his daughter.

00:15.925 --> 00:17.692
I need this to be over!

00:17.727 --> 00:19.293
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

00:19.328 --> 00:20.973
Just doesn't look like that
work thing is gonna happen.

00:20.997 --> 00:22.997
Half a pound of mdma
found in jesse's closet.

00:23.032 --> 00:24.598
It's rainmaker jed's trademark.

00:24.634 --> 00:26.412
Make a list of anyone
that would have had access.

00:26.436 --> 00:27.702
To that much of your product.

00:27.737 --> 00:31.038
Don't trust the guy
with the fire in his eyes.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.674
So no idea who lit your
garage on fire last night?

00:35.144 --> 00:37.411
How easy is it to hack
into a surveillance camera?

00:37.447 --> 00:38.657
Anyone with basic skills
can do it.

00:38.681 --> 00:40.181
Is it traceable?

00:40.216 --> 00:41.582
Hello, little light.

00:46.389 --> 00:47.521
Hi.

00:50.059 --> 00:51.959
Hi.

00:54.330 --> 00:56.697
Are you looking at me right now?

00:56.733 --> 00:58.766
You look tired.

00:58.801 --> 01:02.903
I've wanted to talk to you
since I was 8-years-old.

01:02.939 --> 01:05.306
There's something I've always
wanted to tell you.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.808
When my dad died,
you made it better.

01:09.612 --> 01:12.446
Nobody got it.

01:12.482 --> 01:15.616
Everyone thought I just
needed to face reality.

01:15.651 --> 01:17.485
And get over it.

01:18.721 --> 01:20.688
But I needed him back.

01:20.723 --> 01:22.857
Your light went out.

01:22.892 --> 01:24.992
I wanted to turn it back on.

01:25.027 --> 01:27.928
Is it back on now?

01:27.964 --> 01:31.699
No. You have to force it now.

01:36.038 --> 01:37.872
Do I know you?

01:37.907 --> 01:39.940
You should trust your instincts.

01:39.976 --> 01:41.542
Okay.

01:48.518 --> 01:50.484
You showed me driver.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.721
But someone's trying to pin
this on jed.

01:55.091 --> 01:58.859
My instincts tell me these
are two very different paths.

01:58.895 --> 02:00.327
They're connected.

02:00.363 --> 02:02.563
The murders are connected? Yeah.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.836
You're afraid of me.

02:09.872 --> 02:12.006
I am afraid of you.

02:12.041 --> 02:15.309
Because I don't understand
you yet.

02:17.914 --> 02:20.147
But I'm starting to.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.216
It's not just a game for you,
is it?

02:22.251 --> 02:24.652
It's not just power and control.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.087
It matters what I think of you.

02:28.825 --> 02:31.892
This is about more than
just sandy and jesse.

02:31.928 --> 02:34.161
It's about you and me.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.899
If you want to keep this going.

02:38.935 --> 02:41.535
You have to give me something.

02:44.674 --> 02:47.975
Did the same person
who killed jesse...

02:48.010 --> 02:50.377
Kill sandy? No.

02:50.413 --> 02:53.280
But they are connected?
The murders?

02:53.316 --> 02:55.916
Yes. Connected?

02:55.952 --> 02:57.718
Paths can take you wildly away.

02:57.753 --> 02:59.320
From anything you recognize.

02:59.355 --> 03:02.056
And still bring you back
to your door.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.165 --> 03:45.633
I need to know how
to remember him.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.871
I need to know how he would
want to be remembered.

03:50.907 --> 03:52.806
For the funeral.

03:52.842 --> 03:55.009
She.

04:08.190 --> 04:10.357
You got half an hour
before you're shipped away.

04:12.194 --> 04:14.061
I need more information.

04:14.096 --> 04:17.831
The mdma found in jesse's room,
what form was it in?

04:17.867 --> 04:21.902
Pill form. Yeah, but packaging?

04:21.938 --> 04:24.004
Different guys have access
at different stages.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.307
Was it street level
or wholesale?

04:26.342 --> 04:28.309
Street level.

04:28.344 --> 04:31.478
Little baggies,
like ten pills each,

04:31.514 --> 04:34.882
Secured with elastics. What?

04:34.917 --> 04:39.119
Elastics? No.
That's not my guys.

04:39.155 --> 04:41.121
We don't package it like that.

04:41.157 --> 04:43.457
We're professional.
It's business,

04:43.492 --> 04:46.994
Not some dollar store grab
bag shit.

04:47.029 --> 04:50.030
Whoever packaged those drugs
didn't work for me.

04:52.234 --> 04:54.335
Jed said his guys don't
package like this.

04:54.370 --> 04:56.170
Well, yesterday he wasn't
a drug dealer.

04:56.205 --> 04:58.806
What's that?

04:58.841 --> 05:02.376
Jed's got flair.
Where you going?

05:02.411 --> 05:04.578
I'm gonna figure out
who planted jed's drugs.

05:04.613 --> 05:06.447
In jesse's room. You wanna come?

05:06.482 --> 05:09.016
Fine.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.455
You heard of anyone
selling jed's mdma...

05:14.490 --> 05:16.323
Packaged like this?

05:16.359 --> 05:17.658
No.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.571
How likely is it someone
outside the usual dealers.

05:19.595 --> 05:21.395
Would be selling?

05:21.430 --> 05:23.931
Not here. Maybe outside town.

05:23.966 --> 05:25.799
Those houses along
the toll highway.

05:25.835 --> 05:27.746
Back in the day, crazy neil
almost made a living.

05:27.770 --> 05:29.536
Selling rez cigarettes there.

05:29.572 --> 05:31.105
Used to be,
we tried to talk to you.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.773
It cost us fifty bucks.

05:32.808 --> 05:34.208
Yeah.

05:34.243 --> 05:36.877
I'm working on being somebody
my boy can be proud of.

05:36.912 --> 05:37.956
We're thinking that
someone planted these.

05:37.980 --> 05:39.279
In jesse's room.

05:39.315 --> 05:40.926
Is there anyone else that
we should be talking to?

05:40.950 --> 05:42.761
Problem is no one else is
gonna wanna talk to you.

05:42.785 --> 05:44.585
Right now.
You missed your window.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.253
What window?

05:46.288 --> 05:48.122
Between when the old boss
goes down.

05:48.157 --> 05:49.923
And a new head sprouts
in its place.

05:49.959 --> 05:51.425
There's a new boss?

05:51.460 --> 05:52.671
Like somebody who used
to work for jed.

05:52.695 --> 05:54.395
Who's now running things?

05:54.430 --> 05:57.131
Word is, unpaid debts
are being collected.

05:57.166 --> 06:00.367
And if you can't pay,
bad stuff comes your way.

06:03.305 --> 06:05.739
Hey, listen.
Nobody talking to us.

06:05.775 --> 06:07.441
You wanna keep going, go for it.

06:07.476 --> 06:09.376
I'm calling it a day.

06:15.384 --> 06:18.152
Maggie sweetland's neighbor.

06:18.187 --> 06:19.453
Cali, right.

06:19.488 --> 06:22.756
Sorry, I'm not good
with faces out of context.

06:22.792 --> 06:24.391
Is that a good thing for a cop?

06:25.861 --> 06:29.563
Sometimes you poke around you
might not like what you find.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.299
Sorry?

06:32.334 --> 06:34.668
How's eddie doing? What?

06:36.172 --> 06:39.239
Never mind. Have a good day.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.225
Sorry, I didn't wanna talk
on the phone.

06:58.260 --> 07:01.061
It's okay. It makes me look
important.

07:01.097 --> 07:03.464
Any luck? Maybe.

07:03.499 --> 07:05.933
I have a program running
and I put a clone.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.334
On your phone's ip...

07:07.369 --> 07:09.347
I don't need the details,
just the odds that he'll know.

07:09.371 --> 07:10.938
50/50

07:10.973 --> 07:14.141
Well, keep working
until it's 99/1.

07:14.176 --> 07:15.476
Is it a source?

07:15.511 --> 07:17.244
One I'm not ready to burn.

07:17.279 --> 07:19.546
So don't tell peter.

07:50.212 --> 07:51.912
Eddie!

07:53.382 --> 07:55.415
Eddie, where are you?

08:05.161 --> 08:06.960
Did he stand you up?

08:08.030 --> 08:11.565
Um... I just brought pie.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.500
I'll leave it with you.
His truck is here.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.868
You guys can have it together.

08:14.904 --> 08:17.204
No. It's, it's not...
I mean, he's not here.

08:20.276 --> 08:22.209
She brought pie.

08:22.244 --> 08:24.244
Shit. I'm sorry.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.914
I was on my way and
I trapped my hand and...

08:26.949 --> 08:29.550
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to come here like a stalker.

08:29.585 --> 08:30.918
I'll just leave this with you.

08:30.953 --> 08:33.120
No, come in. We'll eat it here.

08:37.092 --> 08:39.025
Can I talk to you?

08:39.061 --> 08:41.094
No.

08:51.006 --> 08:53.440
She leaves those things
everywhere.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.744
Please.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.723
Mom?

09:09.758 --> 09:11.758
Hey baby.

09:11.794 --> 09:14.528
Hey, um... My key didn't work
in the lock.

09:14.563 --> 09:16.630
I changed the locks. I...

09:17.800 --> 09:20.601
I lost my key and
I was locked out, sorry.

09:20.636 --> 09:22.035
I keep telling you,

09:22.071 --> 09:24.371
Leave your key
in the same place.

09:26.542 --> 09:29.076
Come on!

09:29.111 --> 09:31.845
Is your dad okay?
Come on, daisy.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.480
I should go.

09:33.515 --> 09:35.415
Bye. Love you.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.384
Let's go. How was school?

09:37.419 --> 09:39.119
Boring. Yeah?

09:39.154 --> 09:41.188
Hi, daisy. Hi.

09:43.192 --> 09:44.758
(Crickets chirp)

09:50.933 --> 09:53.100
Hey.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.971
Door's a piece of shit.

09:58.007 --> 09:59.884
If you wanna say something
about my husband, just say it.

09:59.908 --> 10:02.109
He's not your husband.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.777
In fact I heard he upgraded.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.979
You don't know anything
about us.

10:06.015 --> 10:08.682
You, no. Him?

10:08.717 --> 10:10.161
I do know he's got a jagged
little scar.

10:10.185 --> 10:12.252
Just above his naked ass.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.589
You meant something when you
said not to poke around.

10:15.624 --> 10:17.891
You gonna have the balls
to just say what you mean?

10:17.926 --> 10:20.360
You're crazy, babe.

10:20.396 --> 10:23.196
Plastic bundles of turtle
mdma wrapped in kid's elastics.

10:23.232 --> 10:25.666
Mean anything to you?

10:25.701 --> 10:29.369
No idea what you're talking
about.

10:42.551 --> 10:44.117
You come into my house.

10:44.153 --> 10:46.987
You talk about paths
leading home?

10:47.022 --> 10:48.822
Home?

10:48.857 --> 10:51.658
To my family?

10:51.694 --> 10:53.760
Eddie is the connection between
jed and driver?

10:53.796 --> 10:55.762
That makes no sense.

10:55.798 --> 10:58.365
I'll never believe
he hurt anyone.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.767
He'd never do that.

11:00.803 --> 11:03.837
I need a little
understanding here.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.806
Shit just spiraled.

11:05.841 --> 11:08.408
Not my problem.

11:08.444 --> 11:11.778
I know I brought it on myself.

11:11.814 --> 11:13.780
What can I do here?

11:13.816 --> 11:16.616
You want my help? Yeah.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.020
You gotta do something for me.

11:21.590 --> 11:23.223
Talk to me!

11:23.258 --> 11:25.058
I dropped the stone.

11:25.094 --> 11:27.060
But you're not seeing
the ripples.

11:27.096 --> 11:30.430
Tomorrow at the funeral,
wear the watch.

11:31.533 --> 11:33.533
Driver's watch?

11:46.164 --> 11:49.899
My mom's nice, you know.
Like... She loves me.

11:49.935 --> 11:53.036
But I don't think she gets it.

11:53.071 --> 11:55.238
I think she, like,

11:55.273 --> 11:58.174
Just tries to ignore it,
most of the time.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.554
It's probably the only thing
she thinks.

11:59.578 --> 12:01.978
She can do about it, you know.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.417
They shut the power off
at my house again.

12:07.452 --> 12:10.386
Shit. I mean, look,
when we get out of here, man,

12:10.422 --> 12:12.422
We're not gonna have
to worry about.

12:12.457 --> 12:15.391
This stuff anymore, for real.
Yeah, we are.

12:15.427 --> 12:17.460
We don't have any money.

12:17.495 --> 12:19.529
We have no one who's
gonna help us out.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.332
You don't understand how
hard things are gonna be.

12:28.139 --> 12:30.640
Hey, kiddo.

12:30.675 --> 12:33.009
I need to talk to you later.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.347
And you have a choice
that I don't have.

12:37.382 --> 12:40.283
Play hockey, make tons of money.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.719
All you have to do is pretend
to be a dude for a bit.

12:42.754 --> 12:44.020
And you're set.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.289
Yeah, man. No big deal.

12:46.324 --> 12:49.225
Just fuckin' pretend
to be a dude for a bit.

12:49.261 --> 12:51.995
It's what I've been doing.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.863
Fuck this, man.

13:17.022 --> 13:19.188
Stay.

13:19.224 --> 13:20.957
Stay.

13:20.992 --> 13:23.059
Sit down.

13:38.643 --> 13:41.711
My child was everything to me.

13:41.746 --> 13:45.081
From the second jesse
could walk,

13:45.116 --> 13:49.252
My baby was always trying
to take care of me.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.422
Be the man of the house.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.557
My husband was not that.

13:57.529 --> 13:59.062
But my...

14:00.565 --> 14:03.266
My daughter jesse,

14:03.301 --> 14:04.968
She was...

14:06.204 --> 14:08.104
She was strong.

14:08.139 --> 14:12.275
She was always there
for me when I was weak.

14:14.212 --> 14:16.713
Jesse... Who... She truly was...

14:16.748 --> 14:18.614
Someone that I will never...

14:18.650 --> 14:21.384
You deserve this!

14:23.688 --> 14:27.256
The world needs a place
to channel its evil,

14:27.292 --> 14:30.493
So god provides children to kill.

14:30.528 --> 14:34.664
And he gives them to parents
who deserve the pain.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.966
You know what you did!

14:37.002 --> 14:39.602
No, no. You know what you did!

14:39.637 --> 14:41.738
Annie ryder...

14:41.773 --> 14:45.375
He said to move past it,
we have to speak the truth.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.455
Maggie.

15:02.594 --> 15:04.372
Having to grieve with everyone
watching your every...

15:04.396 --> 15:05.962
I don't wanna talk.

15:05.997 --> 15:07.663
I know. I know. Maggie. Maggie.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.266
I don't want to do this either.
But mr. Driver...

15:10.301 --> 15:13.636
That was your fault.
That was you.

15:13.671 --> 15:15.671
You've been talking to him.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.540
Maybe. Probably.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.943
But you're still not telling me
something.

15:20.979 --> 15:23.012
And I don't know what it is
or what it means,

15:23.048 --> 15:26.649
But I know that jesse's killer
is still out there.

15:26.684 --> 15:30.486
And I know that's not
what you want.

15:37.295 --> 15:39.762
Maggie, have you seen this
before?

15:42.267 --> 15:43.900
I can't even have a nice funeral.

15:43.935 --> 15:46.869
And say goodbye to my child
because of you.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.939
You riled up that crazy man!

15:50.975 --> 15:53.743
Just leave me alone, annie.

16:11.663 --> 16:13.062
You couldn't wait 20 minutes?

16:13.098 --> 16:14.230
She was rattled.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.643
It's all about timing,
you know that.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.266
She's hiding something.

16:17.302 --> 16:20.103
She didn't kill her own kid.
I know.

16:20.138 --> 16:21.804
So what are you doing?

16:21.840 --> 16:23.739
She's part of the puzzle
somehow.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.108
I dropped the stone.

16:25.143 --> 16:27.477
I've been talking to
mr. Driver. He's the stone.

16:27.512 --> 16:30.513
She's the ripple. She fits into
this puzzle in some way.

16:30.548 --> 16:33.216
What the hell are you talking
about?

16:33.251 --> 16:36.152
Driver didn't kill jesse.
Maggie didn't kill jesse.

16:36.187 --> 16:37.565
You're going around looking
for someone.

16:37.589 --> 16:38.899
Who planted drugs
in jesse's room.

16:38.923 --> 16:40.801
And how in the name of god
you got to driver and maggie.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.058
Is beyond me.

16:42.093 --> 16:43.726
Just because paths are different.

16:43.761 --> 16:45.528
Doesn't mean they both
don't take you home.

16:45.563 --> 16:46.596
Holy shit.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.398
Ripples and stones
and fucking paths?

16:49.434 --> 16:50.733
He's playing with you.

16:50.768 --> 16:52.668
And you're buying right into it.

16:52.704 --> 16:55.571
Maybe it's in your best
interest to make me think that.

16:57.509 --> 17:01.244
Who burned down your garage,
peter? Kids?

17:01.279 --> 17:03.513
Tell me the truth
and I'll start trusting you.

17:03.548 --> 17:05.515
I thought you could handle
this, annie.

17:05.550 --> 17:07.717
You convinced me that
you could handle this.

17:07.752 --> 17:09.886
I can. He's controlling you.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.587
It's not the other way around.

17:11.623 --> 17:14.557
And I need you
to fucking see that.

17:30.241 --> 17:32.775
Daisy, did you leave with dad?

17:32.810 --> 17:34.477
Yeah.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.045
Are you with him now?

17:36.080 --> 17:38.447
No. Just at rueben's.

17:38.483 --> 17:41.918
Do you think jesse
would've liked the funeral?

17:41.953 --> 17:43.953
With mr. Driver and all that?

17:43.988 --> 17:47.757
No. The rest of it.
I don't know, baby.

17:47.792 --> 17:50.393
Dad... Dad's picking you up
later?

17:51.796 --> 17:53.729
Okay.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.635
Um... Did you see brady?
He was my ride.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.810
Do you need a ride?

18:31.436 --> 18:38.374
Music.

18:47.252 --> 18:50.586
It's not fair! It hurts!

18:50.622 --> 18:52.688
Everything hurts!

18:52.724 --> 18:55.758
I miss you, jesse!

18:55.793 --> 18:57.927
I will miss her forever!

18:57.962 --> 19:00.263
She was my friend!

19:00.298 --> 19:03.699
She was great!
She was beautiful!

19:04.936 --> 19:07.103
I love you, jesse!

19:24.330 --> 19:26.297
Eddie didn't stay
to give you a ride?

19:29.902 --> 19:32.236
I didn't want him to.

19:32.271 --> 19:35.639
Brady gets pissed
about the guys I date.

19:35.675 --> 19:39.443
I'm an adult.
I can make my own choices.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.580
Plus eddie's nothing
like those guys.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.551
I'm sorry.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.789
You make me nervous.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.258
You have this way.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.694
You'd never get yourself
in the situations I have.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.262
Maybe brady's not such
an asshole.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.231
To be worried about you.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.601
I know. It's 'cause of how
we grew up.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.907
He kinda had to protect me
and my mom.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.045
And I have made bad guy choices.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.953
Does eddie ever seem out of it?

20:24.357 --> 20:25.923
High.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.793
No.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.601
Eddie?

20:40.306 --> 20:42.039
Eddie!

20:52.351 --> 20:54.151
It's eddie, leave a message.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.535
What?

21:44.570 --> 21:46.570
Daisy's dog is in your freezer!

21:46.606 --> 21:50.341
Shit! Tell me where you are now!

21:57.216 --> 22:00.017
Hey, no hard feelings about
the interview, all right?

22:04.390 --> 22:06.690
Rough day, man.

22:06.726 --> 22:10.661
I keep playing that night
over and over.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.363
Talking to him and...

22:12.398 --> 22:14.765
Deciding not to pick him up.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.837
That's lifelong regret
stuff there, tom.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.641
We all have it.

22:23.676 --> 22:28.178
Those split second decisions
that haunt us for our lives.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.648
Are you saying we're not
so different, you and I?

22:30.683 --> 22:34.018
If you had your time back,
would you do it again?

22:34.053 --> 22:36.854
Leave jesse on the road?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.490
I would not. I would not.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.962
There's our difference.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.864
You don't regret your mistakes?

22:46.899 --> 22:49.033
You can regret something
while still knowing.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.335
You'd do it all again.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.546
See ya.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.265
I haven't heard from you.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.400
Nothing to say.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.304
I'd find something.

23:42.755 --> 23:46.390
I made one mistake, okay.
I needed money for that job.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.826
With the guy in furniture.
I was gonna sell once.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.594
And get the tools and
get on the right path.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.529
To doing something I liked.
So, what?

23:52.565 --> 23:54.343
You bought the drugs and what?
Someone paid you to plant them.

23:54.367 --> 23:55.666
In jesse's room? What?

23:55.701 --> 23:57.613
Don't play dumb. If someone
connects you to the drugs.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.703
Like I did you're gonna
be a suspect for murder.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.971
What are you talking about?

24:01.007 --> 24:02.517
The drugs with our kid's
hair elastics.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.586
That we found in jesse's room.
Did you put them there?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.343
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

24:06.379 --> 24:08.357
Well then, how did they get
there because they are there.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.748
What? You think I'd plant
drugs in a dead kid's house so,

24:10.783 --> 24:12.716
So what, the cops would arrest
the wrong guy?

24:12.752 --> 24:14.096
In a, in a town where
my kid lives?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.086
Well then, what happened?
Because that's where.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.955
We found them!
Is that what you think of me?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.701
Is that what you fucking
think of me, annie?

24:19.725 --> 24:22.259
They stole them. They fucking
stole them from me!

24:22.294 --> 24:26.363
I'm trying to get my shit
together. I'm trying to change.

24:29.268 --> 24:32.670
You owe them money.
For the drugs.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.938
Your boss is cracking down.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.775
I'm taking care of it.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.411
They killed daisy's dog?

24:40.446 --> 24:43.781
I'm fixing my problem.
I'm making my debt go away.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.616
Are you here to hurt somebody?

24:45.651 --> 24:48.185
Not if I don't have to.
Not if he has what he owes.

24:48.220 --> 24:52.356
Hey. Eddie.
It will change you. Please.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.358
From what? From a fucking loser?

24:54.393 --> 24:55.959
A guy who's a fucking loser?
A fuck up?

24:55.995 --> 24:58.062
From a guy who saved my life
and who fought with me.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.763
Until I had no fucking
voice left.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.143
And who parks outside
his kid's house.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.033
Just because he wants
to be near... Eddie!

25:03.069 --> 25:04.968
Shit!

25:20.953 --> 25:25.155
Were the drugs stolen before
or after jesse was killed?

25:26.459 --> 25:28.425
After.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.464
You're gonna have
to talk to peter.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.569
I fucking hate peter.

25:41.207 --> 25:46.076
You're gonna have to testify
that those drugs were yours.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.048
It's not your brightest moment,
eddie.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.850
Yeah.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.653
You know I never liked you.
Good.

25:56.689 --> 26:00.290
No. It's nothing personal.
Obviously.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.493
Well, you just seem
like such a fuck up.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.661
Getting in fights.

26:04.697 --> 26:07.331
Always got in trouble.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.867
Tough guy.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.480
Then you got her pregnant
and then I'm like,

26:11.504 --> 26:13.437
Well, that's a big surprise,
isn't it.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.905
Regular fucking cliche.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.708
Yes, it would seem that way.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.578
But... You got a spine.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.982
And a good heart.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.684
And you'd die for those two.
And I know that.

26:30.523 --> 26:33.423
This is a one time thing.
It is a one time thing.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.159
I'm gonna need a list of anybody.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.927
Who knew or could possibly know.

26:36.962 --> 26:39.329
Or could figure out
that you had the drugs.

26:40.533 --> 26:43.267
And I need to know
who took over for jed.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.770
I, I don't know that.

26:53.879 --> 26:56.079
You still battling
those pain pills?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.482
I flushed 'em this morning.
Good.

26:58.517 --> 27:01.819
Not that I don't get how she
can drive you to the bottle.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.454
Believe me.

27:08.894 --> 27:10.360
He's telling the truth.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.262
Mostly.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.931
Are you wasted?

27:13.966 --> 27:16.700
Would you like someone else
to go in and do the interview?

27:19.872 --> 27:23.440
I think your guy burned
my garage down, okay?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.242
'Cause I burnt your
sandy driver shack.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.678
I think he saw me. Why?

27:29.615 --> 27:31.426
'Cause I didn't want you
to get caught up in something.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.350
That you're not gonna get
to the truth of.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.118
Why won't I get
to the truth of it?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.521
Because we all tried.

27:41.126 --> 27:42.860
How did he know you were
at the shack?

27:42.895 --> 27:45.362
I don't know, annie.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.030
Maybe he hangs out there.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.828
<i>I went to the shack today.</i>

28:51.864 --> 28:54.197
<i>I maybe going crazy,</i>

28:54.233 --> 28:56.433
<i>But I felt with every fiber
of my being.</i>

28:56.468 --> 28:59.303
That you were there too.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.107
<i>Like with me or next to me.</i>

29:04.143 --> 29:06.610
<i>Or you had been there.</i>

29:06.645 --> 29:08.512
<i>Am I wrong for feeling you?</i>

29:08.547 --> 29:11.048
<i>For feeling connected to you?</i>

29:11.083 --> 29:13.183
<i>Is it crazy?</i>

29:13.218 --> 29:15.953
When I was a kid people
told me it was crazy.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.254
It's not crazy.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.755
You were there?

29:19.858 --> 29:20.958
Yes.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.527
Standing in that same spot.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.863
The flower, that beautiful
but so oddly placed flower.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.399
You would have been drawn
to it too.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.736
You stood on the edge
of that cliff.

29:32.771 --> 29:36.306
Yes. Looking over
that same water.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.275
When you saw the body.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.211
Floating in the water.

29:42.715 --> 29:46.817
You go to the shack.
You saw peter burn it.

29:46.852 --> 29:49.686
Maybe you go there a lot.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.533
Maybe this one time when
you went you looked out.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.857
And you saw jesse's body.

29:58.664 --> 30:01.064
Jesse wasn't killed there.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.567
The body floated.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.138
But you wouldn't have
known that.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.475
Just a body.

30:11.510 --> 30:12.821
That's what you saw.
That's all you saw.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.811
That's all you know. No.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.414
Conversion therapy?
You didn't know about that.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.583
Your first riddle
was about religion.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.119
It's a trans kid - no brainer.
Tom had an alibi.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.254
Driver. Maggie?

30:25.491 --> 30:28.258
What am I doing listening
to you?

30:29.461 --> 30:31.595
Ripples... Maggie?

30:32.631 --> 30:34.598
Peter was right.

30:35.801 --> 30:38.602
I'm the stone.

30:38.637 --> 30:41.204
I created the ripples
that you wanted

30:41.240 --> 30:43.874
'cause you get off on this shit!

30:43.909 --> 30:45.675
You don't know anything!

30:45.711 --> 30:48.078
You don't know who killed
jesse. Do you?

30:48.113 --> 30:49.513
No.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.416
You don't know anything.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.451
I do know some things.

30:55.521 --> 30:59.256
I know that even with your
family, you feel alone.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.264
Odds are still 55/45. Sorry.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.232
Doesn't matter.
He's not a source anymore.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.301
I want him out of my life.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.236
Trace him. Now.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.950
Okay. So I'm pretty sure
we've got the right guy.

31:17.985 --> 31:19.318
Pretty sure?

31:19.353 --> 31:21.653
I had to trace him using
anomalies in phone lines.

31:21.689 --> 31:22.821
What does that mean?

31:22.856 --> 31:24.167
Well, you said you
didn't wanna know.

31:24.191 --> 31:26.124
I wanna know now.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.061
I looked at ip addresses
that were using.

31:29.096 --> 31:31.096
Similar patterns
to reroute themselves.

31:31.131 --> 31:32.564
Okay? That's what hackers do.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.644
Now this one's been most active
in the last couple of days.

31:34.668 --> 31:37.669
And conceals itself using
the exact same spoof pattern.

31:39.273 --> 31:42.007
So I've got a trace on you
and him on my screen.

31:42.042 --> 31:43.909
Now head north.

31:51.619 --> 31:54.386
It stopped moving now.
About a hundred yards.

32:03.597 --> 32:06.098
Annie, what are you seeing?

32:53.947 --> 32:56.348
You got some serious nerve.

32:58.752 --> 33:01.420
You are out of chances.

33:01.455 --> 33:03.155
But you have to know that.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.890
I want you and your boys
to leave my house.

33:04.925 --> 33:06.158
And my family alone.

33:06.193 --> 33:08.493
Yeah well, it's not so simple.

33:08.529 --> 33:10.629
I got a rep to establish.

33:10.664 --> 33:14.066
I come off as weak
this early in the game...

33:17.571 --> 33:20.105
Then don't.

33:27.114 --> 33:29.114
Agh!

33:30.784 --> 33:33.885
Agh!

33:37.391 --> 33:39.024
Agh!

33:39.059 --> 33:40.292
Anthony. Yes. Anthony.

33:40.327 --> 33:42.327
The guy that jed told
to burn the white truck.

33:42.363 --> 33:43.973
He's the only interesting guy
that eddie named.

33:43.997 --> 33:46.142
And he's the only one who has
a connection to jesse's case.

33:46.166 --> 33:48.600
The drugs were stolen from
eddie after jesse was killed.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.602
Anthony knew that eddie
had the drugs.

33:50.637 --> 33:52.270
We have to talk to this guy.
Agreed.

33:52.306 --> 33:54.217
We've had an apb out on him
since he burned the truck.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.675
But he's long gone.
But it's a crack in the case.

33:56.710 --> 33:58.488
Whoever stole the drugs from
eddie knew they were jed's.

33:58.512 --> 33:59.811
And was trying to frame him.

33:59.847 --> 34:01.524
Jed didn't plant the drugs
to point to himself.

34:01.548 --> 34:03.815
Hang on a second. Annie
we still have the earring.

34:03.851 --> 34:05.484
We've got a burnt truck.

34:05.519 --> 34:07.486
We've got a hidden relationship
with jesse.

34:07.521 --> 34:10.389
Jed has no alibi.
Witnesses put him at the scene.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.391
His fingerprints
are all over the earring.

34:12.426 --> 34:13.626
Because he buried the earring.

34:13.659 --> 34:15.060
Because he wanted to honor
jesse.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.072
Okay. We'll put it all in
the report and send it off.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.063
To the prosecutor.
But at this point,

34:19.099 --> 34:21.299
You know there's nothing
we can do to change anything.

34:23.469 --> 34:25.871
Did peter talk to you
about eddie?

34:25.906 --> 34:28.039
It's in here. He'll be
subpoenaed by the defense.

34:28.074 --> 34:30.375
Getting' off light.

34:31.545 --> 34:33.411
The drugs are planted.
Jed's not guilty.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.914
Think about it.

34:47.094 --> 34:49.761
Maggie?

34:49.797 --> 34:52.230
Your door was open.

34:58.906 --> 35:00.338
I'm so sorry.

35:01.742 --> 35:06.077
I know I can't give you back
your goodbye to jesse.

35:07.147 --> 35:09.881
But if there's anything
I can do...

35:11.585 --> 35:13.985
You're the only one who knows.

35:18.091 --> 35:21.693
My kid was killed because of me.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.832
It's retribution.

35:26.867 --> 35:29.267
For what I did to her.

35:31.104 --> 35:33.104
It all started with me.

35:34.208 --> 35:36.675
Her as in jesse?

35:36.710 --> 35:37.909
Or... Who?

35:42.616 --> 35:44.883
Sandy.

35:46.687 --> 35:49.721
Maggie, what did you do?

35:49.756 --> 35:51.289
I...

35:51.325 --> 35:53.124
Maggie! Mag! Maggie!

35:53.160 --> 35:55.227
Shit! Maggie!

35:55.262 --> 35:56.761
Come on, maggie, stay with me.

35:56.797 --> 35:58.930
Hold on!

35:58.966 --> 36:00.432
I need an ambulance...

36:03.745 --> 36:05.678
<i>Know where you stand instantly.</i>

36:40.448 --> 36:42.782
What happened?

36:48.023 --> 36:49.455
I bought myself some time.

36:49.491 --> 36:51.291
They won't come
to the house anymore.

36:51.326 --> 36:54.661
I'll figure it out from here.
Shit.

36:56.364 --> 36:58.431
It's okay, annie.

36:59.734 --> 37:02.335
What are you doing here?

37:02.370 --> 37:06.339
Maggie sweetland
took a bunch of pills.

37:06.374 --> 37:09.575
She also told me some stuff.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.446
You know, you look like shit.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.950
You should sleep on it
whatever it is.

37:18.753 --> 37:20.720
I know it's your week
to have daisy,

37:20.755 --> 37:24.190
But you know she can't stay
at your place, right?

37:25.527 --> 37:27.393
Yeah.

37:29.431 --> 37:31.130
You could stay over too.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.967
You know? Just for peace
of mind.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.903
On the couch.

37:36.938 --> 37:38.438
Jesus.

37:41.076 --> 37:45.545
I've never known you to know
what time it is. Ever.

38:05.233 --> 38:07.200
Heard you use to sell rez
cigarettes.

38:07.235 --> 38:09.836
On highway 411 back in the day.

38:11.172 --> 38:13.373
You said you were working
the night sandy was killed,

38:13.408 --> 38:16.576
But you wouldn't tell the cops
what your job was.

38:16.611 --> 38:19.012
Were you selling cigarettes?

38:19.047 --> 38:20.480
But that highway's a toll road.

38:20.515 --> 38:23.983
You could've proven
where you were.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.899
You kept the receipts?

38:39.934 --> 38:41.968
Why didn't you show
these to my dad?

38:42.003 --> 38:44.437
It was my fault she died.

38:46.341 --> 38:49.008
In so many ways.

38:49.044 --> 38:52.879
I didn't wanna try
and prove it wasn't.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.383
Why did you keep them?

38:57.419 --> 39:00.453
In case I ever get too lost
in here.

39:02.023 --> 39:04.957
And start to think it was I who.

39:06.361 --> 39:10.363
Put my hands around her neck.

39:11.599 --> 39:14.000
Sometimes we need things.

39:14.035 --> 39:16.636
To help us see the truth.

39:17.739 --> 39:19.550
This helped me see that I can
believe in someone.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.208
Who's says he knows things.

39:34.989 --> 39:36.956
I guess I should go to bed.

39:40.395 --> 39:42.895
In a bit.

39:42.931 --> 39:45.631
I thought people say
it's like riding a bike.

39:45.667 --> 39:48.067
Like you never forget
how to do it.

39:48.103 --> 39:49.902
I didn't forget.

39:49.938 --> 39:52.205
A car swerved
and I ran into a tree.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.707
And it took my tooth.

39:54.742 --> 39:56.676
I think you should
get a gold tooth.

39:56.711 --> 39:58.077
Please get a gold tooth.

39:58.113 --> 39:59.512
Then you'd look like a pirate.

39:59.547 --> 40:02.181
Just like you've always wanted.

40:02.217 --> 40:03.583
Thank you.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.952
I'm glad my pain is such
a source of fun for you.

40:09.858 --> 40:10.823
No!

40:10.859 --> 40:11.624
Please. Yes.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.959
Absolutely not. Yes.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.460
Please. No. Are you serious?

40:14.496 --> 40:15.595
Yes. Are you serious?

40:15.630 --> 40:17.864
Yes.

40:17.899 --> 40:19.365
I think he's really mad.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.001
Y'ar, matey.

40:22.036 --> 40:23.269
No?

40:23.304 --> 40:25.004
That's the worst pirate
I've ever seen.

40:25.039 --> 40:26.472
Come on. Really?

40:26.508 --> 40:29.976
Now go to bed.

40:37.485 --> 40:40.219
You never use to use the locks.

40:41.422 --> 40:43.589
Because of me?

40:48.396 --> 40:51.063
No. Just a general feeling.

40:53.735 --> 40:55.279
You should probably tell your
girlfriend.

40:55.303 --> 40:56.802
That you're staying over.

40:56.838 --> 41:00.439
She's not my girlfriend,
annie. She's just a girl.

41:00.475 --> 41:02.875
Who you like.

41:02.911 --> 41:05.178
I don't know.

41:15.089 --> 41:17.890
You love me too much the way
I am.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.295
I don't want to be the way
I am anymore.

42:19.921 --> 42:22.822
I was wrong.

42:22.857 --> 42:25.091
You do know things.

43:12.706 --> 43:13.539
Next monday,

43:13.640 --> 43:14.674
To solve the murder,

43:14.775 --> 43:15.808
The past holds the key.

43:15.909 --> 43:17.120
I haven't been to that cabin.

43:17.144 --> 43:18.210
Since he died.

43:18.312 --> 43:19.345
Don't go there, annie.

43:19.446 --> 43:20.479
But can annie.

43:20.580 --> 43:21.647
Handle the truth?

43:21.748 --> 43:22.782
Need to make sense.

43:22.883 --> 43:23.916
Of all of this.
