WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:01.956
Previously on "Shots Fired"...

00:01.979 --> 00:04.061
It's possible that all I've accomplished

00:04.129 --> 00:06.455
will be overshadowed by the
deaths of these two young men.

00:08.377 --> 00:10.585
Beck was having a bad day,
it doesn't make him a murderer.

00:10.650 --> 00:12.352
- It makes him a liar.
- I heard this was your last week.

00:12.375 --> 00:13.828
- Going out with a bang?
- Might as well.

00:13.851 --> 00:16.027
I'll follow when you are
capable of leading.

00:16.091 --> 00:17.262
Kerry!

00:18.986 --> 00:21.259
I just spoke to Kiana. Where...?

00:21.821 --> 00:23.261
There's a young woman in surgery

00:23.327 --> 00:25.128
- fighting for her life.
- It's nothing to do with me.

00:25.151 --> 00:27.120
Why am I not surprised to see
you here, Brother Terry?

00:27.143 --> 00:28.905
She's being charged with
the murder of Joey Campbell.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.592
You recorded us?

00:30.657 --> 00:33.441
- Drop this custody suit.
- You're unfit to be a mother.

00:33.506 --> 00:35.425
Assaulting an officer, resisting arrest?

00:35.491 --> 00:36.872
It won't get you your daughter back.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.287
Ashe!

02:02.556 --> 02:04.160
We got to get you checked out.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.514
I'm good.

02:08.579 --> 02:10.851
They beat your ass worse.

02:10.916 --> 02:13.220
Way, way worse.

02:13.285 --> 02:16.101
Whoever "they" are.

02:16.166 --> 02:18.342
Nothing seems to be missing, though.

02:18.407 --> 02:20.871
Looks like you got here just after them.

02:20.936 --> 02:23.720
He was after Jesse's phone
and the video on it.

02:23.785 --> 02:25.097
Why do you think that?

02:25.161 --> 02:27.241
We just told Platt about it.
Too coincidental.

02:27.306 --> 02:29.162
Yeah, but we have files on the Tours.

02:29.227 --> 02:31.435
Notes, witness statements.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.917
Maybe they were after
the safe house address.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.116
Whatever he was after,
he was a professional.

02:35.181 --> 02:37.869
Both our cases blew up tonight.

02:37.934 --> 02:40.526
We got to hit them hard.

02:40.591 --> 02:42.582
We have five days.

03:02.551 --> 03:04.022
Any, any of y'all seen Shawn?

03:04.087 --> 03:06.295
- No, ma'am.
- What, he ran off?

03:07.641 --> 03:09.016
Yeah, we got into it.

03:09.081 --> 03:10.169
He'll turn up.

03:10.234 --> 03:11.993
You see him, you let me know, all right?

03:12.058 --> 03:13.936
I'm over there in 308, on
the other side of the mailbox.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.194
I know, Miss Campbell.

03:16.380 --> 03:18.235
I'm gonna check the church.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.060
My God, you don't know.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.372
Know what?

03:21.438 --> 03:24.541
Cops came and arrested
Pastor Janae last night.

03:24.606 --> 03:26.487
They're saying she's the one
who killed your Joey.

03:30.081 --> 03:31.626
You might remember,
Pastor Janae first came

03:31.649 --> 03:33.792
to prominence after bringing
together the mothers

03:33.858 --> 03:34.987
of Jesse Carr and Joey Campbell.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.354
She also called for more scrutiny

03:36.418 --> 03:38.979
on the Gate Station County
Sheriff's Office

03:39.044 --> 03:41.348
and following a dramatic arrest
last night

03:41.413 --> 03:43.876
and the discovery of a gun,
everybody out there is shocked.

03:43.942 --> 03:47.078
Mr. Terry, are you responsible
for Pastor Janae's arrest, sir?

03:47.142 --> 03:48.518
Do you have any comment, sir?

03:48.583 --> 03:50.407
How'd you know the gun
was in the church?

03:50.471 --> 03:51.719
Anonymous tip.

03:51.784 --> 03:53.095
You trace it?

03:53.160 --> 03:56.265
Serial number's been filed down.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.929
Ballistics?

03:57.995 --> 04:01.898
Yeah, it's the gun
that killed Joey Campbell.

04:10.094 --> 04:11.726
Take the shackles off.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.511
It's policy.

04:14.577 --> 04:17.296
My interview, my rules.

04:29.653 --> 04:31.061
How are you?

04:31.126 --> 04:33.199
I spent my night counting
civil rights violations.

04:33.244 --> 04:35.358
- How about you?
- Been better.

04:36.119 --> 04:37.377
The gun found in your office
was the same gun

04:37.400 --> 04:39.160
used to kill Joey Campbell.

04:39.225 --> 04:41.593
This is so Gate Station...
that ain't my gun.

04:41.658 --> 04:42.947
How do you explain it being there?

04:42.970 --> 04:44.851
What motive could I possibly
have for killing him?

04:44.891 --> 04:46.404
You didn't want drug dealers
in the Houses.

04:46.427 --> 04:48.540
- Maybe he didn't listen.
- No.

04:48.604 --> 04:50.972
We had a break-in a few nights ago.

04:51.037 --> 04:54.205
They stole a computer and some speakers.

04:54.270 --> 04:57.118
- Maybe that's when the gun was planted.
- Did you report it?

04:57.707 --> 05:00.256
We'd be reporting it to the
people who put it there.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.144
Why would they put the body on you,

05:02.209 --> 05:04.416
and not some petty lowlife?
That'd be easier.

05:04.482 --> 05:06.466
Do you know the origin
of policing in the South?

05:06.531 --> 05:08.962
Slave patrols.

05:09.027 --> 05:10.691
White men given the authority

05:10.756 --> 05:12.717
to question, search, and harass us.

05:12.785 --> 05:13.744
Sound familiar?

05:13.797 --> 05:17.125
Policing in the U.S. wasn't
created to protect and serve.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.942
It was created to control us.

05:20.007 --> 05:22.471
They are trying to control me.

05:22.536 --> 05:24.904
As protected as you think
you are, folks are talking.

05:24.969 --> 05:27.305
Witnesses heard you threaten
Joey Campbell.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.871
His mama didn't have no problem
with me getting in his face

05:29.938 --> 05:31.018
when he was messing up.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.640
Did she know you and The Hands
got physical with him?

05:34.860 --> 05:36.557
Do not answer that, Pastor.

05:39.598 --> 05:41.034
I'm having a hard time

05:41.087 --> 05:43.223
reconciling the woman we met
is capable of murder.

05:43.275 --> 05:44.239
Yeah.

05:44.304 --> 05:46.192
People rarely show you
who they really are.

05:46.257 --> 05:48.400
But I'm not gonna rush to judgment.

05:48.465 --> 05:50.353
Let's hold a beat before
putting out a statement.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.298
- The press will ask you about it today.
- I want you to keep them at bay.

05:53.363 --> 05:55.251
I don't want anything
clouding this event.

05:55.315 --> 05:57.235
We are badly in need of a win.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.366
I spoke with both men this morning.

05:58.389 --> 06:02.101
They're excited. And very grateful.

06:02.166 --> 06:03.222
You have the speech?

06:05.431 --> 06:07.927
You're confident about
the timing of this?

06:07.993 --> 06:11.065
They brought Gate Station
together 50 years ago.

06:11.130 --> 06:15.066
And I think that they can help
do it again, ma'am.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.891
- Hey, Shameeka.
- Hey.

06:20.957 --> 06:24.285
Sorry to bother you. We just
need to ask you a few questions.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.006
I heard they arrested her.

06:31.008 --> 06:33.408
She say she did it?

06:33.473 --> 06:34.336
No.

06:34.401 --> 06:37.346
How would you describe
her relationship with Joey?

06:37.411 --> 06:39.746
What'd Pastor say?

06:40.772 --> 06:41.731
We want to hear from you.

06:43.653 --> 06:47.366
I found out Joey was selling weed.

06:47.430 --> 06:50.151
Told me he was doing it to help
me out, and I nearly lost it.

06:50.215 --> 06:53.095
Pastor... stepped in.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.311
Stepped in how?

06:54.377 --> 06:57.001
She told him she'd help him get
into NC State

06:57.066 --> 06:58.313
if he stopped hustling.

06:58.378 --> 07:01.354
Took him on a tour of the campus
and everything.

07:01.419 --> 07:02.724
He came home all excited about it.

07:02.764 --> 07:04.363
Jesse Carr went to NC State.

07:04.428 --> 07:07.468
- Any chance they knew each other?
- I don't know, I don't think so.

07:07.543 --> 07:09.773
If Pastor Janae was such
a positive influence,

07:09.838 --> 07:11.662
why are you not surprised
she was arrested?

07:11.727 --> 07:15.535
I heard Joey was selling again.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.936
I asked Pastor to take care of it.

07:18.001 --> 07:20.497
"Take care of it"?

07:20.562 --> 07:23.442
Look, I didn't know what else to do.

07:23.507 --> 07:26.067
He came home all roughed up, and...

07:27.316 --> 07:29.204
And I didn't ask no questions.

07:29.269 --> 07:31.509
So if it's true,

07:31.574 --> 07:33.814
if Pastor Janae had something
to do with my baby's death,

07:33.878 --> 07:36.087
then it's my fault, too.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.746
We're supposed to protect them,
no matter what.

07:39.769 --> 07:42.232
- And here I am, two boys gone.
- Where's Shawn?

07:42.298 --> 07:44.441
Ran away last night.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.522
- Like he punishing me.
- For what?

07:48.187 --> 07:51.644
Losing Joey.

07:51.699 --> 07:54.547
- We've got to keep an eye out for Shawn.
- No doubt.

08:05.762 --> 08:07.810
- They're setting her up.
- Why?

08:07.875 --> 08:09.410
They're trying to assassinate
the sister.

08:11.204 --> 08:13.092
You one of them or one of us?

08:13.156 --> 08:15.332
I don't trust them
and I don't trust you.

08:21.516 --> 08:23.488
Better stay woke.

08:46.598 --> 08:48.838
- Morning.
- Morning.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.929
Which one of those boys don't
like cheese in their grits?

08:50.952 --> 08:52.968
Christian.

08:55.154 --> 08:57.154
I haven't had the energy
to make them anything

08:57.234 --> 08:59.178
but cold cereal the past couple weeks.

08:59.253 --> 09:01.867
They'll survive.

09:02.146 --> 09:03.885
So...

09:04.045 --> 09:06.058
you ready to talk now?

09:06.373 --> 09:08.589
Nothing to talk about.

09:08.771 --> 09:10.399
We had a fight.

09:10.459 --> 09:12.987
- I needed space.
- "Space"?

09:13.869 --> 09:16.114
You need space, you put
his butt on the couch.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.140
You don't walk out.

09:17.218 --> 09:19.073
31 years, your daddy and I,

09:19.126 --> 09:21.188
we never went to sleep on a fight.

09:21.252 --> 09:22.862
Now, that don't mean there
weren't a whole lot of nights

09:22.885 --> 09:23.940
that turned into morning.

09:25.062 --> 09:26.213
Mama, he's different.

09:26.278 --> 09:28.998
Baby, what do you expect?
Of course he's different.

09:29.063 --> 09:32.456
He's a grown man who can't go to
work, can't go out in public...

09:32.520 --> 09:34.120
You think this has been easy on me?

09:34.184 --> 09:37.321
No, but this is not about you right now.

09:37.386 --> 09:40.266
The world is talking about your man
like they know his heart.

09:40.331 --> 09:45.471
And now he's wondering
if he lost his family.

09:46.125 --> 09:49.578
For better or for worse.
This right here's the worse.

09:50.574 --> 09:53.231
We've never talked about it.

09:53.295 --> 09:55.152
Talked about what?

09:55.216 --> 09:59.121
What actually happened... the shooting.

09:59.186 --> 10:01.010
You asking him is the same

10:01.074 --> 10:03.506
as accusing him of murdering that man.

10:03.571 --> 10:07.892
Kerry, you know his heart.

10:07.957 --> 10:11.157
Do you think Josh is capable
of something like this?

10:12.502 --> 10:15.894
- No.
- Then never ask him.

10:17.816 --> 10:20.473
Used to be a Gate Station
deputy parked out front.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.329
What happened?

10:22.394 --> 10:23.929
I didn't need him anymore.

10:23.994 --> 10:25.530
That your decision or theirs?

10:25.595 --> 10:26.939
What difference does that make?

10:27.003 --> 10:29.851
I just want to make sure
they're still being supportive.

10:29.917 --> 10:32.060
They ain't your family,
Josh, never were.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.276
Is there a point here?

10:33.342 --> 10:34.343
Why are you protecting them?

10:34.366 --> 10:35.633
We know you know about the Tours.

10:36.311 --> 10:38.460
We believe you know what happened
that night Joey was killed.

10:38.483 --> 10:40.384
- What are the Tours?
- I don't.

10:41.001 --> 10:43.287
Someone broke into our
work space, sucker-punched me,

10:43.339 --> 10:44.402
and I'm still mad about it.

10:44.449 --> 10:47.362
They were after a video
we recovered from Jesse's phone.

10:47.426 --> 10:50.115
He recorded your stop.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.164
They're afraid that if you go down,

10:52.228 --> 10:54.885
you're gonna take the entire
department with you.

10:54.950 --> 10:57.926
Now we're giving you
a chance to come clean.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.038
Tell us what you know,
maybe we can help you out.

11:00.104 --> 11:02.119
Show us the evidence.

11:07.274 --> 11:08.847
They don't have a video.
They're bluffing.

11:08.874 --> 11:11.082
We're done here, thank you.

11:11.147 --> 11:12.587
You lied, Deputy Beck.

11:14.316 --> 11:15.916
Jesse didn't open his door.

11:15.980 --> 11:20.366
You pulled it open for him after
he threw his I.D. on the ground.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.335
I don't bluff.

11:33.171 --> 11:34.771
We have an eyewitness, maybe two

11:34.835 --> 11:36.627
who says Arlen Cox killed Joey.

11:36.692 --> 11:38.868
But the murder weapon was
found in Pastor Janae's office.

11:38.933 --> 11:40.948
Which she says was
planted there during the robbery.

11:41.014 --> 11:42.389
Alleged robbery... you think

11:42.454 --> 11:44.412
the Hands are going to let
somebody jack the pastor?

11:44.438 --> 11:45.856
So why be the loudest person in the room

11:45.879 --> 11:47.745
- yelling, "What about Joey?"
- Takes suspicion off.

11:47.768 --> 11:49.656
What are you arguing, Ashe?

11:50.745 --> 11:52.185
She beat him.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.297
A 17-year-old kid.

11:54.362 --> 11:55.898
We can't ignore that.

11:55.963 --> 11:57.381
So we ignore everything else we know?

11:57.404 --> 11:59.195
Look.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.404
I know you believe Cory.

12:01.469 --> 12:03.517
And I know you believe
this department is dirty.

12:06.015 --> 12:08.062
I need a look at that gun.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.591
I know you all pulled triple shifts

12:10.656 --> 12:12.910
to make sure we had
a strong presence out there,

12:12.969 --> 12:14.528
and the city is grateful.

12:14.594 --> 12:16.001
Now that things are back to normal,

12:16.066 --> 12:17.826
we got to get our numbers back up.

12:17.891 --> 12:20.067
So we need to go fish.

12:20.131 --> 12:23.363
Speeders, expired tags,
anything you can pull in.

12:23.429 --> 12:25.284
These riots ain't gonna
pay for themselves.

12:25.349 --> 12:27.333
All right, dismissed.

12:29.126 --> 12:30.662
I feel like we've been here before.

12:31.911 --> 12:33.191
Like dÃ©jÃ  vu, wouldn't you say?

12:33.257 --> 12:34.664
I want that gun.

12:34.728 --> 12:36.585
We're in the middle
of the investigation.

12:36.649 --> 12:39.689
So are we. And federal trumps Mayberry.

12:39.754 --> 12:42.507
We'll turn it over as soon
as we're done with that testing.

12:42.571 --> 12:44.171
We'll take it now.

12:50.447 --> 12:51.950
What more can the gun tell us?

12:52.014 --> 12:53.711
Who it really belongs to.

12:53.776 --> 12:55.471
Platt said the serial number's gone.

12:55.536 --> 12:57.700
When I was in Mexico, we were
tracking so many illegal guns

12:57.723 --> 12:59.185
coming in from the U.S.

12:59.249 --> 13:01.233
Cartels would shave the numbers off,

13:01.298 --> 13:04.565
but they were actually embedded three,
four layers deep in the steel.

13:05.011 --> 13:06.707
Right person can still pull them up.

13:06.772 --> 13:08.660
Who's the right person?

13:11.381 --> 13:13.909
I'll get it done.

13:24.730 --> 13:26.490
Hey.

13:28.092 --> 13:29.211
Appreciate you picking up.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.004
<i>What do you want?</i>

13:32.317 --> 13:34.909
I'm sorry.

13:34.974 --> 13:36.509
I deleted the audio.

13:36.575 --> 13:38.216
I was never gonna send it,
anyway, you know that.

13:38.239 --> 13:40.671
<i>No.</i>

13:40.736 --> 13:42.624
<i>I know nothing when it comes to you.</i>

13:42.689 --> 13:44.352
<i>Not no more.</i>

13:44.418 --> 13:48.450
It was a desperate move, Javi,
but when it comes to Kai,

13:48.515 --> 13:51.299
you'd do the same.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.355
<i>That it?</i>

13:53.540 --> 13:55.172
I need a favor.

13:55.237 --> 13:57.829
<i>It's not for me, it's this case I'm on.</i>

13:57.894 --> 14:00.710
They killed a 17-year-old black boy.

14:00.775 --> 14:03.335
I have the murder weapon, but
the serial number's been filed.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.063
I need to get at that number.

14:05.129 --> 14:08.105
I'm not the only one
who can do this, so...

14:08.170 --> 14:09.705
send it through proper channels.

14:09.770 --> 14:12.906
That'll take days... I need it now.

14:12.972 --> 14:16.108
This is what we do, Javi,
get the bad guys.

14:19.342 --> 14:21.485
Get it to me.

14:23.087 --> 14:25.007
DOJ courier will be on the next plane.

14:25.071 --> 14:26.863
Thank you.

15:08.639 --> 15:10.495
Morning, sir.

15:10.559 --> 15:12.576
Your license and registration, please.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.880
I need to reach into my glove box.

15:14.946 --> 15:16.641
Go right ahead.

15:26.022 --> 15:27.525
Can I ask what I did?

15:27.589 --> 15:29.776
You have to signal at least 100
feet before making a turn.

15:29.799 --> 15:32.294
You've got to be kidding me...
how am I supposed to know that?

15:32.359 --> 15:33.703
It's the law.

15:33.768 --> 15:36.008
How much is the ticket?

15:37.449 --> 15:38.825
150.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.618
150?

15:40.682 --> 15:43.626
I already got a $75 jaywalking
ticket I can't afford.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.685
And if I can't pay it, y'all
will put a warrant out on me

15:45.708 --> 15:47.340
and I'll get locked up and lose my job,

15:47.404 --> 15:50.188
and I can't pay it no way.

15:52.879 --> 15:54.734
Can you let me off with a warning?

15:54.799 --> 15:57.456
Just this once, please.

15:59.569 --> 16:01.937
I'm sorry, sir.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.914
I'm just doing my job.

16:04.979 --> 16:07.059
Then can at least I go to mine now?

16:07.123 --> 16:08.468
Yeah, have a good day, sir.

16:17.495 --> 16:18.455
You ready, Mom?

16:18.487 --> 16:20.311
Been ready for five minutes.

16:53.155 --> 16:56.067
<i>- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Mom.</i>

16:56.133 --> 16:57.541
<i>All that!</i>

17:01.287 --> 17:02.855
<i>Are you ready, Mom?</i>

17:02.919 --> 17:04.640
<i>I've been ready for five minutes.</i>

17:15.299 --> 17:19.972
In 1962, segregation was
a way of life in Gate Station.

17:20.036 --> 17:22.436
Most people accepted it.

17:22.502 --> 17:24.709
But not Horace Alvers and Darius Smith.

17:24.775 --> 17:28.262
These two men, one black and one white,

17:28.327 --> 17:31.083
went together to the Main Street Diner

17:31.180 --> 17:32.617
and sat down at the lunch counter.

17:32.681 --> 17:35.401
They were taunted, they were humiliated,

17:35.466 --> 17:37.065
and they were arrested.

17:37.131 --> 17:41.579
But they came back the next day,
and the next, and the next,

17:41.644 --> 17:43.820
for seven days straight.

17:43.886 --> 17:45.037
And then on the eighth day,

17:45.102 --> 17:47.310
five people joined them at the counter.

17:47.375 --> 17:48.718
And the next day, it was ten.

17:48.783 --> 17:50.191
And soon, that room was packed

17:50.256 --> 17:54.512
with black and white diners,
eating together.

17:54.577 --> 17:58.034
These two brave men created
a new normal...

17:58.098 --> 17:59.633
Governor, you might want
to cut it short.

18:03.156 --> 18:06.964
It appears Mr. Smith is taking
a well-deserved nap.

18:09.142 --> 18:11.414
That's not the kind of nap
you wake up from, Governor.

18:11.479 --> 18:12.439
Mr. Smith?

18:15.352 --> 18:16.639
- Governor.
- My God.

18:16.692 --> 18:18.936
Governor, we need to go right now.

18:30.661 --> 18:32.260
Kick it!

18:36.863 --> 18:38.399
Daddy!

18:38.465 --> 18:39.840
Daddy!

18:39.905 --> 18:41.537
Daddy!

18:42.818 --> 18:43.778
What's going on, crazies?

18:45.667 --> 18:47.234
Mama Moore.

18:48.164 --> 18:49.315
Josh.

18:50.821 --> 18:53.029
Go ahead, go play.

18:54.694 --> 18:56.998
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:58.568 --> 19:00.360
Look, the way that I acted,

19:00.424 --> 19:04.072
um, taking out all my
frustration on y'all...

19:05.450 --> 19:08.170
I'm sorry.

19:08.235 --> 19:11.595
The boys missed you.

19:11.660 --> 19:13.388
I missed you.

19:16.302 --> 19:17.965
I missed you so much more.

19:28.082 --> 19:30.418
<i>Pastor Janae Jones currently in custody</i>

19:30.483 --> 19:31.836
<i>at the Gate Station Sheriff's Office.</i>

19:31.859 --> 19:32.979
<i>Now in a statement,</i>

19:33.044 --> 19:34.324
<i>Governor Eamons says she's</i>

19:34.388 --> 19:36.116
<i>really shocked by this arrest.</i>

19:36.181 --> 19:38.997
<i>Janae, who took to Governor
Eamons to the Houses...</i>

19:39.062 --> 19:40.917
Hey.

19:40.983 --> 19:43.126
<i>I'm faxing you the info.</i>

19:43.191 --> 19:44.855
<i>- You got the number?
- Yep.</i>

19:44.920 --> 19:47.384
<i>However, Governor Eamons...</i>

19:47.449 --> 19:48.440
Thanks, Javi.

19:48.505 --> 19:50.681
<i>Ashe, we're not partners.</i>

19:50.746 --> 19:52.025
<i>We're not friends.</i>

19:52.090 --> 19:55.099
<i>If it ain't about Kai, don't call me.</i>

20:12.257 --> 20:14.561
The gun used to kill
Joey Campbell is yours.

20:14.626 --> 20:16.162
Excuse me?

20:16.227 --> 20:19.011
You paid for it in October of last year.
Old North Firearms.

20:24.870 --> 20:27.110
My God.

20:28.135 --> 20:29.895
That's my gun.

20:32.585 --> 20:34.440
- It was stolen.
- Really? When?

20:34.505 --> 20:35.657
About two months ago.

20:35.722 --> 20:37.417
My son and I went for lunch

20:37.482 --> 20:40.331
after spending time
shooting at the range

20:40.842 --> 20:43.524
- and the gun was taken from my car.
- You filed a report?

20:43.597 --> 20:45.772
Of course I did!

20:45.838 --> 20:49.037
I know that stolen guns usually
end up on the street.

20:49.102 --> 20:51.534
And I wanted to do things
in a proper manner.

20:59.410 --> 21:01.938
Gates Station Sheriff's Office.

21:02.003 --> 21:03.538
Yes, ma'am.

21:03.603 --> 21:05.213
Do you have a police report
filed by Arlen Cox

21:05.236 --> 21:06.516
for a stolen Beretta 92?

21:21.370 --> 21:25.467
Gate Station, best department
money can buy.

21:25.531 --> 21:29.148
Cory and Kiana can be enough to indict.

21:29.213 --> 21:30.877
Even if we have to compel
Kiana to testify.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.693
Except both are black, poor.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.766
Don't speak the King's English.

21:36.832 --> 21:40.287
Justice is supposed to be blind,
but she can be a racist bitch.

21:40.353 --> 21:41.600
We needed that gun.

21:41.665 --> 21:45.089
Shirlane's out of recovery.

21:45.154 --> 21:46.562
We should find out what she knows.

21:46.627 --> 21:49.123
So where did that ten G's
you gave her come from?

21:49.187 --> 21:51.145
I know first-year attorneys
ain't rolling like that.

21:52.741 --> 21:55.333
Borrowed it from my brother.

21:55.398 --> 21:58.214
You sure ain't the same cat
I met six weeks ago.

21:58.279 --> 22:00.743
For a minute, I didn't think you
were the same person, either.

22:00.807 --> 22:03.208
I know.

22:03.273 --> 22:06.633
My head was messed up from the hearing.

22:06.698 --> 22:08.412
But I'm good now.

22:09.994 --> 22:11.637
You know, it's like
I want to do what's right,

22:11.660 --> 22:14.380
but nobody's playing fair.

22:14.445 --> 22:19.309
We all get into this wanting
to ride in on the white horse.

22:19.374 --> 22:21.740
But you learn pretty quick

22:22.095 --> 22:24.970
you can't play a clean game
against dirty players.

22:25.676 --> 22:28.241
But you're still good, Preston.

22:29.554 --> 22:32.562
I think Beck could be guilty.

22:32.627 --> 22:35.763
But I don't want to put
a brother away for this.

22:35.829 --> 22:39.349
And I want Arlen because
he's a racist bastard.

22:42.199 --> 22:44.086
I don't want to see color, but I do.

22:44.151 --> 22:46.735
What no one seems to get,
it ain't about seeing race.

22:46.817 --> 22:48.760
It's about seeing where
people are coming from.

22:48.824 --> 22:51.000
We do that, we do our jobs.

23:01.181 --> 23:03.581
You can imagine how shocked I was

23:04.618 --> 23:07.883
when I discovered that it was my gun

23:07.954 --> 23:10.815
that was recovered
from the pastor's church.

23:10.881 --> 23:13.152
- I was, too, Arlen.
- I want to know how that happened.

23:13.218 --> 23:14.593
I'm finding out.

23:14.658 --> 23:17.666
Those two people are aiming
to blame that killing on me.

23:17.732 --> 23:19.427
They're gonna be gone
in less than a week.

23:25.644 --> 23:28.288
<i>Oncology, 554, please. Oncology, 554.</i>

23:28.362 --> 23:30.155
I'm so sorry.

23:30.263 --> 23:32.279
I didn't think I was
putting you in any danger.

23:32.374 --> 23:34.254
It was almost worth it.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.491
This is a hell of a story.

23:37.547 --> 23:39.466
What did Kiana tell you?

23:39.532 --> 23:41.643
She said she was coming
around the corner

23:41.707 --> 23:44.929
to see who was hollering,

23:45.042 --> 23:47.238
when she heard the gunshot.

23:47.793 --> 23:50.476
She saw Arlen Cox

23:50.543 --> 23:53.583
kneeling over Joey, holding a gun.

23:53.648 --> 23:56.336
Arlen Cox.

23:56.401 --> 24:00.786
She said there were two
sheriff's deputies with him.

24:00.851 --> 24:02.194
Did she name the deputies?

24:02.259 --> 24:03.763
She knew one of them.

24:03.828 --> 24:05.427
Derkin.

24:05.492 --> 24:09.333
He-he worked the Houses.

24:09.398 --> 24:10.933
Didn't know the other one,

24:10.998 --> 24:14.551
but maybe if you put some
pictures in front of her,

24:14.615 --> 24:16.376
she might recognize him.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.912
Kiana went ghost again.

24:17.977 --> 24:23.769
Well, even if you find her,
she won't testify.

24:23.835 --> 24:26.193
She's too scared.

24:27.644 --> 24:30.547
She has good reason to be.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.958
Alicia.

24:39.073 --> 24:41.280
I heard on the news.

24:41.345 --> 24:42.401
About Pastor Janae.

24:50.052 --> 24:51.684
I hope you like it.

24:51.749 --> 24:55.044
Some folk think I make mine
too sweet, but...

24:55.110 --> 24:56.421
No, it's good.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.423
Anyone ever tell you your voice
go up a little when you lie?

25:00.488 --> 25:02.727
I was...

25:02.792 --> 25:04.841
I leave the bags in too long, though.

25:04.905 --> 25:06.729
Lord knows I don't need nothing else

25:06.794 --> 25:08.266
keeping my eyes open at night.

25:08.331 --> 25:09.514
Yeah.

25:09.579 --> 25:12.651
I can't even fall asleep
without a little help.

25:12.716 --> 25:15.052
It's like I sleep, but I don't rest,

25:15.116 --> 25:17.677
if that makes any sense.

25:17.741 --> 25:21.934
I listen to Jesse's old voice messages.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.727
You know, or I-I watch him.

25:28.786 --> 25:29.745
Do you...

25:29.778 --> 25:31.601
Do you want to meet him?

25:31.667 --> 25:33.714
Yeah.

25:33.779 --> 25:36.051
Okay, okay.

25:36.116 --> 25:38.004
Boy.

25:40.150 --> 25:41.973
Let's see.

25:42.039 --> 25:45.175
<i>Okay, it's graduation,
this is my beautiful baby!</i>

25:45.239 --> 25:47.448
<i>He's going away!</i>

25:47.512 --> 25:49.076
<i>I love you, baby,
he's leaving high school!</i>

25:49.099 --> 25:49.976
<i>I love you, too.</i>

25:50.041 --> 25:52.697
<i>You're leaving high school,
how do you feel?</i>

25:52.763 --> 25:55.802
<i>I feel... good, ready.</i>

25:55.867 --> 25:58.139
<i>Ready, that's good.
Okay, ready for what?</i>

25:58.204 --> 26:00.764
<i>The world.</i>

26:00.829 --> 26:02.268
Go out and conquer.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.620
<i>Conquer like Deadpool!</i>

26:03.714 --> 26:05.554
<i>You're a superhero.</i>

26:06.943 --> 26:09.567
Shawn will be back.

26:12.417 --> 26:15.169
- Play another one.
- Okay.

26:22.505 --> 26:26.103
- Hi, there, boss. How you doing?
- Good, Calvert.

26:26.438 --> 26:28.246
You want to come in?

26:28.454 --> 26:30.473
Maybe we could talk outside.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.376
Sure.

26:43.180 --> 26:45.356
Okay, well, I guess I'll leave.

26:45.421 --> 26:47.416
There's nothing that,
there's nothing I need to know.

26:55.376 --> 26:56.752
Hey, everything okay?

26:56.816 --> 26:57.936
Yeah, honey.

26:58.001 --> 26:59.633
I'm fine.

28:04.056 --> 28:05.111
12! 12!

28:13.115 --> 28:15.418
Just give me the bag back! Give me it!

28:17.240 --> 28:19.900
- Stay down! Don't move!
- Get off me, man!

28:19.965 --> 28:21.979
- What the hell you doing here?
- Nothing.

28:22.042 --> 28:23.418
Stay down.

28:24.313 --> 28:25.708
Come with me.

28:28.048 --> 28:31.024
Now, why would you be
in a place like that?

28:31.088 --> 28:32.400
Nowhere else to go.

28:32.465 --> 28:33.968
What's wrong with home?

28:34.033 --> 28:35.300
Not trying to be there right now.

28:44.501 --> 28:46.458
Don't you think your mom
might be worried about you?

28:47.703 --> 28:51.639
It can't be easy for her.

28:51.704 --> 28:53.079
Losing her oldest boy.

28:53.144 --> 28:55.576
It's easy for y'all
to kill black people?

28:55.641 --> 28:58.330
- Now that's what you think we do?
- I know that's what y'all do.

28:58.394 --> 29:00.538
You used to lynch us,
and now y'all shoot us.

29:00.603 --> 29:03.195
Like we ain't even human,
like my brother was a dog.

29:05.725 --> 29:07.452
I'm sorry about your brother.

29:11.647 --> 29:14.463
But there's nothing I can do
to bring back your brother.

29:14.528 --> 29:17.087
Nothing I can do about the lynchings

29:17.153 --> 29:18.381
that happened before I was born.

29:19.906 --> 29:23.298
You know, I pulled over someone today

29:23.363 --> 29:25.187
and gave him a ticket.

29:27.204 --> 29:29.188
And he asked me for a break.

29:31.654 --> 29:33.734
Guy needed a break.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.624
That's all.

29:39.688 --> 29:42.377
You know, maybe I'm making
you my do-over.

29:42.442 --> 29:45.033
My brother doesn't get a do-over.

29:47.371 --> 29:49.515
Tell me something about him.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.596
Why?

29:51.661 --> 29:53.836
Because I'd like to know.

29:56.239 --> 29:59.438
My brother always used to walk
around with a basketball.

30:01.393 --> 30:03.792
Like a baller.

30:03.857 --> 30:06.129
But he can't play.

30:06.194 --> 30:10.355
He thought he could, but he was so bad.

30:12.821 --> 30:16.533
Now, you think he'd want you
staying in abandoned buildings?

30:16.598 --> 30:18.293
Not being with your mom?

30:23.384 --> 30:25.144
What?

30:25.209 --> 30:27.129
I just wish that she'd just stop

30:27.193 --> 30:30.425
trying to make me her do-over with Joey.

30:41.585 --> 30:43.549
Hey, Boogs.

30:44.448 --> 30:46.207
I'm wearing your bracelet.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.436
I never take it off.

30:49.377 --> 30:52.929
Reminds me I did one good thing.

30:52.995 --> 30:57.347
You are the most beautiful girl
in the world.

30:57.413 --> 31:01.125
And the fastest, and
the strongest, and the bravest.

31:04.903 --> 31:09.415
You ever feel down, you hear
my voice telling you that.

31:09.481 --> 31:12.136
I know this is hard,

31:12.202 --> 31:15.082
but just remember,
this is part of your journey,

31:15.147 --> 31:18.219
and one day, you'll be proud
you made it through.

31:18.284 --> 31:20.139
You'll be like a superhero.

31:23.469 --> 31:25.837
You are the very best part of me.

31:27.503 --> 31:30.287
Embrace your fearlessness, okay?

31:30.352 --> 31:34.416
And your curls and your pretty
brown skin and your butt.

31:34.481 --> 31:37.361
You got that from me, too.

31:42.228 --> 31:46.069
You are loved, Kai.

31:46.134 --> 31:49.750
So deeply.

31:49.815 --> 31:53.719
Don't ever let anyone
take that truth away from you.

31:57.690 --> 32:01.305
If anything ever happens to me,

32:01.371 --> 32:03.259
I need you to know this.

32:06.260 --> 32:08.359
I love you, Boogs.

32:22.090 --> 32:25.101
I'm sorry about your friend.
This was supposed to be a special day.

32:25.537 --> 32:29.103
Life doesn't always agree
with our plans,

32:29.168 --> 32:32.336
so you have to stay open to new ones.

32:32.436 --> 32:34.964
How do you do that?

32:35.030 --> 32:37.151
See life so simply, after
everything you've been through?

32:37.174 --> 32:40.343
My daddy raised me to be
a 24-hour person.

32:40.407 --> 32:42.359
A 24-hour person?

32:42.424 --> 32:45.801
It means you're not
the righteous preacher

32:45.861 --> 32:47.548
that cheats on his wife.

32:47.892 --> 32:51.930
You don't do right by the boss
and then backstab your friends.

32:51.995 --> 32:55.932
A 24-hour person knows who they are,

32:55.997 --> 32:57.629
is consistent.

32:57.693 --> 33:02.238
Somebody you can depend on
24 hours a day.

33:02.303 --> 33:06.079
That's what Darius and I tried to be.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.570
I ain't been in that diner in... years.

33:13.635 --> 33:15.395
Mind if I go in and take a look?

33:15.460 --> 33:16.675
Sarah, you and Trevor

33:16.741 --> 33:18.692
- take Mr. Alvers inside?
- Yes, ma'am.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.521
So how come we're not just
drinking at the hotel?

34:35.136 --> 34:36.382
Better music.

34:38.145 --> 34:41.025
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on here?

34:45.667 --> 34:47.460
I'll be back.

34:50.853 --> 34:52.389
Got a minute, Lieutenant?

34:55.495 --> 34:56.967
Sure.

35:11.117 --> 35:12.268
What?

35:14.030 --> 35:16.845
You looking for a heart-to-heart?

35:16.911 --> 35:19.278
I got your text.

35:19.344 --> 35:21.839
You're done messing with my daughter.

35:21.904 --> 35:23.376
You're done messing with my head.

35:25.393 --> 35:27.377
You drove under the influence.

35:27.443 --> 35:30.194
You assaulted a police officer.

35:30.259 --> 35:31.411
I'm just telling the truth.

35:31.476 --> 35:32.659
So am I.

35:32.724 --> 35:35.412
You were there
when Arlen Cox killed Joey.

35:35.477 --> 35:38.037
You covered it up.

35:39.607 --> 35:40.918
Well.

35:40.983 --> 35:43.511
The difference is that I can prove mine.

35:45.081 --> 35:47.274
What you're missing, Lieutenant,

35:48.504 --> 35:50.602
is I'm smarter than you.

35:58.205 --> 36:00.606
You ever want to be a mother
to your little girl again,

36:00.670 --> 36:02.878
you better start figuring out
what the word "smart" means.

36:04.832 --> 36:07.551
You got that, you relentless bitch?

36:17.666 --> 36:19.062
No.

36:45.998 --> 36:47.373
Ashe.

36:49.359 --> 36:51.054
Ashe!

36:55.282 --> 36:56.753
Ashe!

37:18.105 --> 37:20.249
I just lost Kai.

37:20.315 --> 37:21.562
- I lost her.
- What?

37:21.627 --> 37:24.187
Breeland made a report.

37:24.252 --> 37:26.587
Assaulting an officer, drunk driving.

37:26.652 --> 37:28.220
- Did you?
- No, it doesn't matter.

37:28.285 --> 37:29.831
He's gonna send it to the
judge and it's over.

37:29.854 --> 37:31.389
Ashe, I will destroy him on the stand.

37:31.454 --> 37:33.191
- I could've killed him.
- Nobody's going to hurt you like that!

37:33.214 --> 37:35.326
I could have killed him, I wanted to.

37:35.391 --> 37:36.671
But you didn't.

37:38.085 --> 37:40.512
- I don't deserve her.
- Don't say that.

37:40.578 --> 37:42.754
I killed somebody's child,
why shouldn't I lose mine?

37:42.818 --> 37:44.514
I'm no good, I'm no good.

37:44.578 --> 37:46.787
- I'm not good for anybody, I'm no good.
- Yes, you are.

37:46.851 --> 37:48.099
Hey, yes, you are.

37:49.796 --> 37:52.612
You are.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.474
You don't want this.

38:08.657 --> 38:10.604
Hey.

38:45.112 --> 38:46.936
Look at me.

38:47.298 --> 38:50.355
Ashe, look at me.

40:09.046 --> 40:11.157
Was it self-defense, Josh?

40:20.826 --> 40:22.585
Yes.

41:10.155 --> 41:12.812
<i>Great, popo.</i>
