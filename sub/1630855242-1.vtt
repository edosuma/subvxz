WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.250
ALL:
Ooh!

00:05.450 --> 00:08.850
Look, Freddie.
Spit-shined and ready to go.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.390
Wait.

00:10.590 --> 00:12.880
(gargles, spits)

00:13.910 --> 00:16.980
Just needed a little more spit.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.200
Ooh, is this one of
those edible arrangements?

00:22.400 --> 00:24.650
(spits) No.

00:25.490 --> 00:26.710
So, are you nervous?

00:26.910 --> 00:28.170
(scoffs)

00:28.370 --> 00:30.580
Does LeBron James get nervous
before the big game?

00:30.780 --> 00:33.210
Are you LeBron James
in this situation?

00:33.410 --> 00:34.750
(laughs nervously)

00:34.950 --> 00:37.720
I'm the one who convinced
these two to give it a shot,

00:37.920 --> 00:39.720
but you don't see
anyone giving me a diamond.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.420
Do you think
they'll give me a diamond?

00:42.620 --> 00:45.160
Oh, Millicent,
this isn't about you.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.490
Now let me stand to your right

00:46.690 --> 00:48.910
so I get my good side
in the pictures.

00:51.380 --> 00:52.920
Oh, I got it.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.700
(chuckles):
Yes!

00:58.900 --> 01:00.940
It's covered
in my mother's spit.

01:01.140 --> 01:03.490
It really is.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.480
"Hello, Carly. We haven't spoken
in three weeks,

01:11.680 --> 01:13.840
so let me just say
something weird to you."

01:15.600 --> 01:17.460
Uh, is this an intervention?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.090
- (door closes)
- Fine, Marissa.

01:19.290 --> 01:21.490
It is me eating your makeup,

01:21.690 --> 01:24.450
but I can stop any time I want!

01:25.710 --> 01:28.530
Lewbert Robinette
Patricia Sline...

01:28.730 --> 01:30.370
(whispers):
Robinette Patricia?

01:30.570 --> 01:32.910
(whispers):
I know. I love it.

01:33.110 --> 01:35.510
Lewbert, my Big Sline,

01:35.710 --> 01:38.380
- my Sline Ball.
- Uh...

01:38.580 --> 01:41.180
Will you make me the happiest
mother of Freddie on earth?

01:41.380 --> 01:44.370
(screaming)

01:50.170 --> 01:51.260
Is that a no?

01:51.460 --> 01:54.460
(others clapping)

01:54.660 --> 01:56.100
I want what they have.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.760
- Do you?
- Not really.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.550
- (door opens)
- Hey, Freddie...

02:01.920 --> 02:03.700
- Oh, yay!
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.140
Pearl's here!
Everybody, look!

02:06.340 --> 02:08.310
It's Pearl and she's here!

02:08.510 --> 02:10.630
A toast to Pearl!

02:12.030 --> 02:13.900
Who is here!

02:15.200 --> 02:16.380
Ah.

02:16.580 --> 02:17.980
Thanks,

02:18.180 --> 02:21.400
- but Freddie is
all the toast that I need.
- Aw.

02:22.740 --> 02:25.610
(groans) These are both empty.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.830
I'm engaged!

02:29.030 --> 02:33.800
I'm gonna dig up my mom
and laugh in her face!

02:34.000 --> 02:36.470
Aw, another couple
as happy as we are.

02:36.670 --> 02:37.770
- (chuckles)
- Sad I missed it.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.910
Oh, hey, no prob,
I caught the whole thing.

02:40.110 --> 02:43.140
(chuckles):
It looks like Freddie is
proposing to Carly.

02:43.340 --> 02:44.980
You want me to text it to you?

02:45.180 --> 02:46.780
(chuckles):
If you had been here,

02:46.980 --> 02:49.550
you would have
laughed and laughed,

02:49.750 --> 02:52.070
or made the face
you're making right now.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.620
* <i>I know</i> *

02:54.820 --> 02:56.260
* <i>You see</i> *

02:56.460 --> 02:58.620
* <i>Somehow the world</i>
<i>will change for me</i> *

02:58.820 --> 03:01.890
* <i>And be so wonderful</i> *

03:02.090 --> 03:05.500
* <i>So wake up</i>
<i>the members of my nation</i> *

03:05.700 --> 03:07.700
* <i>It's your time to be</i> *

03:07.900 --> 03:10.700
* <i>There's no chance</i>
<i>unless you take one</i> *

03:10.900 --> 03:13.410
* <i>And the time to see</i>
<i>the brighter side</i> *

03:13.610 --> 03:16.710
* <i>Of every situation</i> *

03:16.910 --> 03:18.510
* <i>Some things are meant to be</i> *

03:18.710 --> 03:22.100
* <i>So give me your best</i>
<i>and leave the rest to me.</i> *

03:26.740 --> 03:29.460
So, what'll it be?

03:29.660 --> 03:32.690
Wine and crying,
or whiskey and light violence?

03:32.890 --> 03:34.560
You're sweet,
but it's just gonna be

03:34.760 --> 03:36.330
my regular nightly routine--

03:36.530 --> 03:38.000
drinking kombucha
from a wine glass

03:38.200 --> 03:41.130
and watching videos of soldiers
reuniting with their dogs.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.600
I'm fine.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.400
Really? 'Cause that was
more awkward than

03:44.600 --> 03:47.140
when we had to tell Millicent
her goldfish moved to Canada

03:47.340 --> 03:48.590
for the health care.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.680
Which part?

03:50.880 --> 03:51.980
Almost proposing to Carly

03:52.180 --> 03:54.050
after not talking to her
for three weeks?

03:54.250 --> 03:56.110
My girlfriend walking in
right after?

03:56.320 --> 03:59.320
My mom getting engaged to the
adult man I bullied as a child?

03:59.520 --> 04:04.420
Pearl outright refusing my offer
to text her that video?

04:04.620 --> 04:05.760
So, you and Carly
really didn't talk

04:05.960 --> 04:07.360
the entire time you were gone?

04:07.560 --> 04:08.890
Of course we didn't.

04:09.090 --> 04:11.730
He was on
a super romantic road trip.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.430
With my girlfriend.

04:13.630 --> 04:15.100
Pearl thought
Carly and I were in love,

04:15.300 --> 04:17.500
and I want it to work
with Pearl, so I said,

04:17.700 --> 04:19.410
"Let's get in the car
and just drive."

04:19.610 --> 04:22.440
- (chuckles) Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- You know, spontaneous,
romantic.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.810
A logistical nightmare.

04:24.010 --> 04:25.980
Who's driving?
Where are you staying?

04:26.180 --> 04:29.200
How long are you milking
one pair of underwear?

04:30.700 --> 04:32.590
It was just what we needed.

04:32.790 --> 04:35.750
That and couples therapy
four times a week.

04:35.950 --> 04:38.870
Mm. I can't do therapy.
Too smart for it.

04:40.540 --> 04:41.930
They're so committed.

04:42.130 --> 04:44.800
I mean, paying $200 an hour
to someone who knows

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
what the problem is
but refuses to tell you?

04:47.200 --> 04:48.600
Freddie and Pearl are thriving.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.800
Okay, but what about
Freddie and Carly?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.740
When he ran after Pearl
on his birthday,

04:53.940 --> 04:56.660
you waited up for him
all night, crying.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.880
I was watching a sad movie.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.930
The sad movie was your life.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.720
Fine. You know,
I was upset that night.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.550
I wanted a conversation.

05:07.750 --> 05:11.760
And instead,
I got a text two days later.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.130
"Hit the open road with my lady.
Talk soon?"

05:15.330 --> 05:18.080
Stalk of wheat emoji.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.570
A perfect text.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.280
Stalk of wheat means impotence.

05:24.650 --> 05:25.940
So, that's it.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.410
No part of you thinks
that you're into Freddie?

05:27.610 --> 05:28.870
Well, that's the thing.

05:29.070 --> 05:30.880
You know, I shouldn't have to
think about it.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.410
I want someone
that I am crazy about.

05:33.610 --> 05:35.080
Someone that makes
my knees buckle.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.020
I just wish she'd stop running
away from the conversation.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.420
You drove through six states and
three sovereign indigenous areas

05:40.620 --> 05:41.750
in the same pair of underwear

05:41.950 --> 05:44.040
to get away from
that exact conversation.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.230
Well, he's back now.
You guys can talk.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.400
And I so want to do that,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.000
but I can't.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.070
Not everybody has time
to just go gallivanting

05:54.270 --> 05:57.770
across the Pacific Northwest
like some GD Sasquatch.

05:57.970 --> 06:00.010
I'm too busy
with my new project.

06:00.210 --> 06:03.780
And if that project is real,
I'm very happy for you.

06:03.980 --> 06:06.730
(scoffs):
Oh, it's real.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.680
(whispers):
Paul, I need a new project.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.640
A real one.

06:15.140 --> 06:19.360
An outdoor Las Vegas wedding
in August at high noon?

06:19.560 --> 06:21.430
What a dream!

06:21.630 --> 06:24.330
We were considering Hawaii, but
there's just something classy

06:24.530 --> 06:27.030
about a place where
you can smoke in church.

06:27.230 --> 06:28.230
(phone chimes)

06:28.430 --> 06:30.740
- Your Uber's here, lemon peel.
- Oh.

06:30.940 --> 06:34.240
I use Marissa's account
since my rating is a 0.3.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.780
They're literally allowed
to leave me anywhere.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.730
You will always have five stars
with this girl.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.420
It's sweet to see you so excited

06:43.620 --> 06:47.250
for their outdoor high noon
Las Vegas-- Wait a minute.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.120
I happened to hack into
Grandma B's email

06:50.320 --> 06:52.830
and saw who she's considering
for maid of honor.

06:53.030 --> 06:54.490
Danica from book club.

06:54.690 --> 06:56.060
Wait, which Danica?

06:56.260 --> 06:57.700
The Danica who thought
<i>Lean In</i> was too sexy,

06:57.900 --> 06:59.570
or the Danica
who never takes off her beret?

06:59.770 --> 07:01.900
- Beret.
- Oh, Danica.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.800
Wait,
have you hacked into my email?

07:04.000 --> 07:07.690
No, I respect you too much.
Wink.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.610
Don't feel bad. Danica's been
a maid of honor before,

07:11.810 --> 07:14.050
and those dogs are still
together.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.880
Are you saying
all I have to do is

07:16.080 --> 07:17.920
prove I'll be a better
maid of honor for Grandma B,

07:18.120 --> 07:19.180
and the gig is mine?

07:19.380 --> 07:21.140
You know I'm not.

07:25.770 --> 07:29.190
So glad I got to meet up with
my favorite client in person.

07:29.390 --> 07:30.760
You know, on the phone,
it's all business.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.330
If I don't get a new project
immediately,

07:32.530 --> 07:35.420
I am going to
burn this city to the ground.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.050
My cat's surgery went great.
Thanks for asking.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.770
- How about TV?
- I don't know.

07:41.970 --> 07:44.840
The last time I did a TV show,
I got replaced by a dinosaur.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.850
Well, kids love dinosaurs.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.580
This would be reality TV,
so it'll be real.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.250
Networks are hot for shows
about content creators.

07:51.450 --> 07:52.920
They figure
your followers will watch it.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.490
They won't, but who cares?

07:54.690 --> 07:56.390
We'll already have the cash.

07:56.590 --> 08:00.160
As long as I have total control
but people still like me.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.030
I want to be an absolute boss
in a fun way.

08:03.230 --> 08:06.630
Like "Go ahead, wear jeans
on Fridays, but fear me."

08:06.830 --> 08:09.700
Bully me, queen. (chuckles)

08:09.900 --> 08:11.240
First thing we need is a hook,

08:11.440 --> 08:13.270
like how the D'Amelios
are sisters,

08:13.470 --> 08:15.770
or how the Kardashians
are sisters.

08:15.970 --> 08:17.810
Well, I guess
the hook is a sister.

08:18.010 --> 08:19.780
I only have a brother.

08:19.980 --> 08:21.680
Oh, right, Spencer.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.930
No.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.550
You know who might make
good TV? Freddie.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.990
Freddie? Freddie Benson?

08:31.190 --> 08:32.530
Fredward "Freduccini" Benson?

08:32.730 --> 08:35.340
The neighbor boy who does
the five, four, three, two?

08:36.610 --> 08:38.330
(chuckles):
Oh, I think I know
what's going on.

08:38.530 --> 08:41.230
Five, four, three, two,
you're smashing.

08:41.430 --> 08:44.000
What? No!
Freddie has a girlfriend.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.540
Presumably they're smashing.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.370
Oh, so it's a love triangle?

08:48.570 --> 08:50.280
Because that's a hook.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.180
<i>Amore triangula.</i>

08:52.380 --> 08:54.980
Except there is no triangle.

08:55.180 --> 08:58.020
There's a love line
between Freddie and Pearl.

08:58.220 --> 09:00.690
He and I are a squiggle at best.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.390
A squiggle.
We're gonna win an Emmy!

09:03.590 --> 09:05.340
Whoo!

09:06.310 --> 09:09.630
Look, I am gonna bring
so much drama,

09:09.830 --> 09:12.360
you're not gonna even care
that Freddie's girlfriend

09:12.560 --> 09:14.500
- accused us of being in love.
- (gasps)

09:14.700 --> 09:17.320
Not that that happened.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.560
<i>Amore triangula.</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:29.350
You, latte me,
you, fix the lighting,

09:29.550 --> 09:32.750
and you, call my grandmother
and you tell her to apologize.

09:32.950 --> 09:35.600
(voice breaking):
She knows what she did.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.490
Carly! You look great.

09:40.690 --> 09:42.030
Very natural.

09:42.230 --> 09:43.530
I know, right?

09:43.730 --> 09:46.030
Rumor has it,
my ponytail belonged to

09:46.230 --> 09:48.450
Queen Elizabeth's horse.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.940
The real star has arrived!

09:51.140 --> 09:53.170
Somebody get me a director's
chair, a green juice

09:53.370 --> 09:55.170
and a PA to scream at!

09:55.370 --> 09:57.040
Hey, excuse me,
terrifying woman.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.240
Do you know
where I can find Ms. Carly Shay?

09:59.440 --> 10:00.750
I'm right here.

10:00.950 --> 10:04.280
I'm just disguised
under this blanket of luxury.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.920
Do I need to get into costume?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.920
PA, luxury blanket! Now!

10:08.120 --> 10:12.060
Spencer, I don't know
how to tell you this, so...

10:12.260 --> 10:14.040
I'm gonna make Paul do it.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.600
You've been recast.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.960
Hi, Carly! It's me, Sunny!

10:19.160 --> 10:21.370
You threw up on me
at hot bitch yoga?

10:21.570 --> 10:24.470
We nearly beat a man to death
together?

10:24.670 --> 10:26.300
We're sisters and best friends?

10:26.500 --> 10:29.470
Oh, yes, our fun,
sisterly memories

10:29.670 --> 10:32.090
of assault and bodily fluids.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.480
I ran a very routine DNA test,

10:35.680 --> 10:38.320
and it turns out
Sunny is Carly's 11th cousin.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.750
But since she has
a massive following,

10:39.950 --> 10:41.150
we're rounding up to sister.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.890
If we're gonna be sisters,

10:43.090 --> 10:44.760
we should figure out
who's older.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.640
My filler guy and I
were thinking you.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.860
But I already told a woman

10:50.060 --> 10:51.960
I want to sleep with
that I'm on this show.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.700
I also told her
that I'm Dax Shepard,

10:53.900 --> 10:55.570
and I don't want to lie
to her twice.

10:55.770 --> 10:57.370
I'm sorry, Spencer.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.370
I'm not.
That's showbiz, baby.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.370
Okay, you know what you do need?
A host.

11:01.570 --> 11:04.040
- That's me. I'm the host.
- This show doesn't have a host.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.610
Next up on <i>House of Shay,</i>

11:05.810 --> 11:08.530
Paul shuts up
and admits he was wrong.

11:09.770 --> 11:13.690
Wow.
I am feeling good about this.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.520
I mean, we got a sister.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.390
We got my literal ponytail.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.730
We got an unqualified
white male host.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.330
Yeah, and we've always got
the <i>amore...</i>

11:22.530 --> 11:23.810
No, don't say it.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.160
There's no need for it.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.500
Sunny and I are gonna
rip each other to shreds.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.800
Actually, I'm pivoting away
from "fighting."

11:32.000 --> 11:34.010
I learned to channel
my difficult emotions

11:34.210 --> 11:37.110
into reading YA fantasy novels
to the blind.

11:37.310 --> 11:38.630
I do all the voices.

11:39.430 --> 11:42.830
(deep, raspy voice):
Welcome to Troll Crossing.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.790
Hey, thanks for organizing this
suspiciously elaborate luncheon.

11:50.990 --> 11:52.960
- It's the least I could do.
- Hmm.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.160
Welcome to the family,
Mr. Sline.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.390
Or should I say Pop-Pop?

11:56.590 --> 11:59.310
(screaming, laughing)

12:00.250 --> 12:03.170
It'll be nice to have a strong
male role model in my life.

12:03.370 --> 12:05.990
I taught you how to hunt.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.810
This is all so fancy.

12:09.010 --> 12:12.590
These are the kind of plates
you use again.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.950
Oh, no, my fun blouse!

12:16.150 --> 12:18.650
Would you like me to
lick it off, orange rind?

12:18.850 --> 12:20.420
No need for that, Pop-Pop.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.490
I have a stain remover
right here.

12:22.690 --> 12:24.290
I also have a lint roller,
a sewing kit

12:24.490 --> 12:27.330
and your favorite shade of
medicated ChapStick.

12:27.530 --> 12:29.180
ALL:
Clear.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.900
Hey, those are all things

12:32.100 --> 12:33.600
a maid of honor would have
at a wedding.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.830
You haven't picked one out yet,
have you?

12:36.030 --> 12:39.250
- (utensils clatter)
- Oh.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.670
Don't you think
forcing the conversation

12:41.870 --> 12:43.680
before she's ready
will do more harm than good?

12:43.880 --> 12:45.580
Don't you think you're confusing
my thing with Granny

12:45.780 --> 12:48.130
and your thing with Carly?

12:52.170 --> 12:56.190
You have to kiss a lot of frogs
before you can find your prince.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.160
And let me tell you,
Grandma B spent

12:58.360 --> 13:00.790
a lot of time in the swamp.
(chuckles)

13:00.990 --> 13:02.780
Pause for laughter.

13:03.610 --> 13:04.730
(cell phone chimes)

13:04.930 --> 13:07.570
Oh, it's Danica from book club.

13:07.770 --> 13:11.100
She put her beret in the dryer,
and now it's way too small!

13:11.300 --> 13:12.740
Can she give it
to her pet mouse?

13:12.940 --> 13:15.440
No, you know Julien hates hats.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.030
She needs us.

13:19.430 --> 13:22.260
I never should have paused
for laughter.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.420
Welcome back to
the most dramatic episode

13:27.620 --> 13:29.090
of any show ever.

13:29.290 --> 13:32.320
Still in play are
two immunity idols, four roses,

13:32.520 --> 13:34.590
and a lip sync for your life.

13:34.790 --> 13:37.350
And it all starts... now.

13:38.410 --> 13:41.830
Okay, uh, Carly, Sunny,
let's try this yet again.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.400
I need some real conflict. Okay?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.620
Okay.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.980
You ate the last of
the peanut butter

13:52.180 --> 13:54.010
and then put the jar
back in the cabinet.

13:54.210 --> 13:57.680
So I thought there was more,
but there wasn't!

13:57.880 --> 14:00.190
Oh, do we live together?

14:00.390 --> 14:01.870
That's fun.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.360
Sunny, no, we need more drama.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.460
You know what?
Wh-Why don't you just hit me

14:07.660 --> 14:08.760
one time, real quick.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.060
Oh, I'll hit you,
with some character work.

14:11.260 --> 14:14.120
(silly voice):
Greetings from Troll Crossing.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.540
Oh, this is nothing.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.170
Cut!

14:19.370 --> 14:24.140
(sighs) That was everything
I look for in reality TV.

14:24.340 --> 14:29.330
I mean, peanut butter larceny,
roommates, that voice.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.770
I wanted more troll.

14:33.870 --> 14:35.290
It's not working. Look.

14:35.490 --> 14:37.320
You know what every reality show
has that we're missing?

14:37.520 --> 14:40.540
Writers, wine throwing,
Andy Cohen?

14:41.410 --> 14:42.660
Don't you dare
shift those fingers.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.130
Don't you shift them!

14:44.330 --> 14:45.500
- Don't.
- It's bigger than
the both of us.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.350
Oh!

14:48.680 --> 14:50.140
Look, Paul.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.300
I don't have feelings
for Freddie,

14:52.500 --> 14:54.440
but it's complicated.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.040
- You know, I don't know much
about friendship squiggles
- (elevator bell chimes)

14:57.240 --> 14:59.960
or sex rhombuses, but... (gasps)

15:01.160 --> 15:03.400
(whispers):
<i>Amore triangula.</i>

15:09.770 --> 15:13.230
Look, the road trippers
finally made the trip to set.

15:13.430 --> 15:16.860
(laughs):
I also have a fulfilling life.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.930
FREDDIE:
I was surprised
you're doing another TV show.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.430
Last time,
you got replaced by a dinosaur.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.270
Oh, kids love dinosaurs.

15:23.470 --> 15:25.820
(roars) Love me.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.070
That was a dinosaur.

15:28.270 --> 15:31.810
So, you two sure you want to be
on my reality show?

15:32.010 --> 15:35.150
Yes. We had an emergency session
with Dr. Susan,

15:35.350 --> 15:36.810
during which I told Freddie,

15:37.020 --> 15:39.380
"If you're sure you have no
feelings for Carly whatsoever,

15:39.580 --> 15:41.050
"we should do the show.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.360
"And any scene I'm not in,
I'll sit on the side

15:43.560 --> 15:46.070
with my arms crossed,
watching closely."

15:46.980 --> 15:49.830
To which I replied,
"How can I say no?"

15:50.030 --> 15:54.370
(chuckles) Do I get $200 an hour
for listening to that story?

15:54.570 --> 15:57.450
(laughs) Fun.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.970
Is it too late to replace me
with a dinosaur?

16:01.170 --> 16:02.070
I'm on it?

16:02.270 --> 16:03.780
But until then,

16:03.980 --> 16:08.450
I have got a fun and relaxing
activity for you all to enjoy.

16:08.650 --> 16:11.070
Aerial silking!

16:13.300 --> 16:15.090
I do not feel relaxed!

16:15.290 --> 16:16.550
Perfect, perfect.

16:16.750 --> 16:18.860
Use that anxiety
to fuel your confrontation

16:19.060 --> 16:21.060
at the dramatic height
of two to three feet.

16:21.260 --> 16:23.200
(grunts) Can I get a helmet?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.260
Can you make that two?

16:25.460 --> 16:27.080
Freddie, I'm flying!

16:28.380 --> 16:30.070
She's very flexible.

16:30.270 --> 16:31.870
Triple-jointed elbows.

16:32.070 --> 16:35.020
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.850
Carly, don't worry about
the actual silking.

16:46.050 --> 16:47.820
Uh, worry about being alone
forever

16:48.020 --> 16:51.320
because Freddie refuses
to speak to you. Wow.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.710
Is that what she told you?

16:55.680 --> 16:57.500
Why did no one fetch me
from my trailer

16:57.700 --> 17:00.030
that should have been provided?
I am the host.

17:00.230 --> 17:01.500
There's no host.

17:01.700 --> 17:05.000
Our first twist is a twist.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.270
- Dude, no, no!
- (Carly yelping)

17:08.470 --> 17:10.880
Oh, God! I may not survive this!

17:11.080 --> 17:13.050
CARLY:
Aah! I need a Dramamine!

17:13.250 --> 17:15.850
I was Peter Pan off Broadway.

17:16.050 --> 17:17.720
Hey, Freddie.
Freddie, Freddie, Freddie.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.350
Do you know what Carly's been
saying about you? I do.

17:20.550 --> 17:22.750
Because I've got the receipts.

17:22.950 --> 17:25.720
- Those are from CVS.
- I know, but I used them
to write down

17:25.920 --> 17:28.060
everything you told me
the other day.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.130
Here we go, here we go.

17:29.330 --> 17:30.500
Um... (clears throat)

17:30.700 --> 17:32.300
Pearl could tell
you and Carly were in love.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.830
You went after Pearl while Carly
waited up all night for you,

17:35.030 --> 17:37.570
- crying her eyes out...
- (screaming)

17:37.770 --> 17:40.240
- Oh, my... (groans)
- (grunts)

17:40.440 --> 17:42.470
That's going on the sizzle reel.

17:42.670 --> 17:45.790
Let's do it again,
but this time tackle Pearl.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.110
I am done with this.

17:49.310 --> 17:51.280
But...

17:51.480 --> 17:54.770
But I am keeping the ponytail.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.230
(exhales sharply)

18:00.430 --> 18:03.210
Okay, fine. I'll play Carly.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.570
Hey, Milli-Vanil.

18:08.770 --> 18:10.000
You doing okay?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.740
Grandma B officially chose
her maid of honor,

18:12.940 --> 18:16.270
and it's Danica, from book club.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.210
(cries):
With the beret.

18:18.410 --> 18:21.050
Hey, your grandmother
worships you, okay?

18:21.250 --> 18:22.950
You are going to be
part of her wedding.

18:23.150 --> 18:25.380
Don't tell me
I'm gonna be an usher.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.520
I will accept DJ or higher.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.690
Relationships aren't
about titles.

18:29.890 --> 18:31.520
They're about being there
for each other.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.530
Even when they make
questionable choices?

18:33.730 --> 18:35.290
Even when you're dangling
from the ceiling

18:35.490 --> 18:38.560
- with a silk so far up
your butt that you...
- I beg you.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.620
Have secrets.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.640
Millicent, we have something
we wanted to ask you.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.900
* <i>There's a girl living here</i> *

18:47.100 --> 18:48.810
* <i>That we always hold dear</i> *

18:49.010 --> 18:51.880
* <i>Good old Millicent</i> *

18:52.080 --> 18:54.280
Is this happening?
Did Danica die?

18:54.480 --> 18:57.720
* <i>Such grit and such fight,</i>
<i>sweet as Turkish delight</i> *

18:57.920 --> 19:00.690
* <i>She's good old Millicent</i> *

19:00.890 --> 19:04.490
* <i>The virtues that we extol</i> *

19:04.690 --> 19:07.730
* <i>Deserve a starring role</i> *

19:07.930 --> 19:13.000
* <i>Will you please,</i>
<i>please marry us?</i> *

19:13.200 --> 19:14.300
Be your officiant?

19:14.500 --> 19:17.620
Yes! That's, like,
higher than the bride!

19:20.020 --> 19:23.760
And then I tackled Paul
to the ground.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.840
In a cool way?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.250
No.

19:28.450 --> 19:29.910
(knocking)

19:30.110 --> 19:32.780
Hey, Carly, um...

19:32.980 --> 19:34.350
can we finally talk?

19:34.550 --> 19:39.190
- Oh, I'd love to,
but, uh, Harper is--
- Bye.

19:39.390 --> 19:41.040
A terrible friend.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.330
What do you want to talk about?

19:45.530 --> 19:47.130
How bananas are going extinct?

19:47.330 --> 19:49.070
What's gonna happen
to smoothies?

19:49.270 --> 19:51.140
- I know some people like to
put almonds in it, so...
- Um...

19:51.340 --> 19:54.870
How about why
you flying-tackled Paul?

19:55.070 --> 19:58.860
I guess
that's a good topic, too.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.550
I did wait up for you
that night,

20:03.750 --> 20:06.050
but then you went off
with Pearl,

20:06.250 --> 20:09.320
and things are going so great
with you guys,

20:09.520 --> 20:12.420
I just thought, you know,
maybe we don't need to talk.

20:12.620 --> 20:16.230
Maybe we could just go back
to being Freddie and Carly.

20:16.430 --> 20:17.860
So I...

20:18.060 --> 20:21.300
Created a whole-ass reality show
just to avoid talking to me?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.820
Just as any normal person would.

20:26.990 --> 20:29.070
Look, I'll admit it.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.340
Over the years,
I've thought about

20:31.540 --> 20:33.910
whether we should be together.

20:34.110 --> 20:35.810
And thought about it...

20:36.010 --> 20:39.670
BOTH:
And thought about it
and thought about it.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.290
But you shouldn't have to
think about it.

20:42.490 --> 20:43.970
Exactly.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.760
And...

20:46.960 --> 20:49.090
you know what I never
have to think about?

20:49.290 --> 20:51.710
Being Carly and Freddie.

20:53.110 --> 20:54.530
I know.

20:54.730 --> 20:56.100
It's the best.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.190
(phone chimes)

20:59.020 --> 21:00.640
Shoot, I got to go.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.970
Uh, Pearl is legit
about to join the circus.

21:03.170 --> 21:05.380
(chuckles):
And she could.

21:05.580 --> 21:07.480
Pearl T. Barnum over here.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.950
(chuckles)

21:09.150 --> 21:12.020
Well, thanks for
doing the show today.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.350
Or should I thank Dr. Susan?

21:14.550 --> 21:16.450
(chuckles) Of course.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.190
Paul said
it was important to you.

21:18.390 --> 21:22.960
And no matter what awkward phase
of Carly-Freddie-dom we're in,

21:23.160 --> 21:26.300
no matter who we're dating
or how little we know

21:26.500 --> 21:28.870
about what we're signing up for,

21:29.070 --> 21:32.170
I am always gonna be there
for you.

21:32.370 --> 21:33.740
I promise.

21:33.940 --> 21:35.920
(phone chimes)

21:37.160 --> 21:40.910
How does a leotard cost $7,000?

21:41.110 --> 21:43.950
I got to go,
but, hey, look at us.

21:44.150 --> 21:46.650
We did it, we're talking, huh?
Go us!

21:46.850 --> 21:48.400
Okay, bye.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.290
(door closes)

21:51.490 --> 21:53.460
Did your knees...?

21:53.660 --> 21:55.930
Yeah. They did. I buckled.

21:56.130 --> 21:59.800
Wine and crying,
or whiskey and light violence?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.450
All of the above.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.140
Carly Shay is an influencer.

22:08.340 --> 22:10.270
I'm under this blanket
of luxury.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.240
<i>PAUL:</i>
<i>She's relatable to all women.</i>

22:12.440 --> 22:14.180
(roars) Love me.

22:14.380 --> 22:16.880
<i>PAUL:</i>
<i>She and her attractive,</i>
<i>successful siblings...</i>

22:17.080 --> 22:18.350
She knows what she did.

22:18.550 --> 22:20.450
(deep, raspy voice):
Welcome to Troll Crossing.

22:20.650 --> 22:23.760
<i>PAUL:</i>
<i>...plagued by hangers-on,</i>
<i>desperate to get on TV.</i>

22:23.960 --> 22:25.290
Why did no one fetch me?

22:25.490 --> 22:26.290
I'm Dax Shepard.

22:26.490 --> 22:27.590
Will she ditch the losers

22:27.790 --> 22:29.790
<i>and tackle her insecurities?</i>

22:29.990 --> 22:32.350
<i>All this on</i> House of Shay.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.250
I didn't know
it was gonna be that bad.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.640
Or that Paul was gonna
recast himself as my brother.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.830
(scoffs) I love it.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.190
Dax Shepard's gonna say he's me.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.250
Every network passed.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.100
Ah, makes sense.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.830
Ooh.
