11:25.187 --> 11:26.687
Your Molly's dead.

11:28.690 --> 11:29.923
I'm here.

11:43.838 --> 11:47.841
Elizabeth: Ah, it's
magical, isn't it!?

11:47.843 --> 11:49.543
Magic won't stop
the Roderick gang from

11:49.545 --> 11:51.511
coming in here and holding
up your rich friends.

11:51.513 --> 11:52.646
Oh!

11:52.648 --> 11:54.982
Folks are going to
get killed, Elizabeth.

11:54.984 --> 11:56.516
Mmm!

11:56.518 --> 11:58.251
Kevin, you have got to
try one of these.

11:58.253 --> 11:59.720
No, I don't want...

11:59.722 --> 12:01.121
mmm! Go on.

12:01.123 --> 12:02.389
Mmm.

Nothing good comes
from fear.

12:05.561 --> 12:07.561
Well, nothing good

12:07.563 --> 12:09.463
comes from denial,
either.

12:09.465 --> 12:11.398
Don't be stupid!

12:11.400 --> 12:13.200
I've spent a lifetime
obeying men

12:13.202 --> 12:14.735
who speak to me
in that tone of voice.

12:14.737 --> 12:16.536
I just wouldn't
wager a life

12:16.538 --> 12:18.205
against some
fancy dessert.

12:18.207 --> 12:20.974
But that's just me.

12:20.976 --> 12:22.743
Enjoy your party,
Mrs. Haverford.

12:30.451 --> 12:32.886
Push off!

12:32.888 --> 12:34.121
Good, good.

12:34.123 --> 12:37.124
Lord, I can't relax
with all this racket.

12:37.126 --> 12:39.426
Training's good
for Jasper.

12:39.428 --> 12:42.329
Gives him something
to focus on.

12:42.331 --> 12:44.765
And Marcus, God knows
he's a lost soul.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.266
They're forming
a healthy bond.

12:46.268 --> 12:48.135
Hmm.

12:48.137 --> 12:49.636
Like the bond
of dead soldiers

12:49.638 --> 12:51.972
you saw
on the battlefield

12:51.974 --> 12:54.207
or the bond
of Irish thugs

12:54.209 --> 12:56.843
I saw during
the riots?

12:56.845 --> 12:59.713
Just because we have lived
through violence,

12:59.715 --> 13:01.415
does that mean
that we should learn

13:01.417 --> 13:02.916
the best way
to be violent?

13:19.901 --> 13:21.802
Capt Sullivan.

13:21.804 --> 13:23.270
Well, if I'd known
a fine lady,

13:23.272 --> 13:24.938
such as yourself,
would be in my office,

13:24.940 --> 13:27.741
I'd have foregone
the afternoon cigar.

13:27.743 --> 13:29.242
Do not concern yourself,
capt Sullivan.

13:29.244 --> 13:30.811

to men blowing smoke.

a gala this Friday.

13:37.152 --> 13:39.920
I have secured
the finest foods,

13:39.922 --> 13:43.123
the oldest wine,
the loveliest flowers,

13:43.125 --> 13:45.792
and a viennese
string quartet.

13:45.794 --> 13:47.294
The one item I have
forgotten to secure

13:47.296 --> 13:48.528
is security.

13:48.530 --> 13:49.796
Mm-hmm.

13:49.798 --> 13:51.264
I've come to find
the men

13:51.266 --> 13:52.799
at capt Sullivan's
6th precinct

13:52.801 --> 13:54.301
are better
at distilling trouble

13:54.303 --> 13:55.669
than any
union troops.

13:55.671 --> 13:57.404
Well, thank you,
ma'am.

13:57.406 --> 13:59.840
That's very nice
of you.

13:59.842 --> 14:01.475
We charge two rates.

14:01.477 --> 14:04.377
But this is
a charity event.

14:04.379 --> 14:06.880
Well, that may be,
but my men aren't big

14:06.882 --> 14:08.915
on giving away
their free time.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.851
Hmm, that is
a shame.

14:10.853 --> 14:13.153
Among those present
will be many

14:13.155 --> 14:15.989

leading families.

14:15.991 --> 14:18.258
I have an invitation
here waiting for you.

14:18.260 --> 14:19.759
The mayor will miss

14:19.761 --> 14:21.261
the opportunity
of meeting you.

14:21.263 --> 14:23.563
Did you say
Thursday night?

14:23.565 --> 14:24.998
Friday.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.700
Oh, Friday!

14:26.702 --> 14:30.036
Well, Friday
happens to be

14:30.038 --> 14:31.571
the one night of the week
my men work gratis.

14:31.573 --> 14:33.240
Hmm.

14:33.242 --> 14:34.741
You're
a lucky woman.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.243
All widows are.

14:38.206 --> 14:40.981
Well, I'll see you
at the gala, then.

14:40.983 --> 14:43.683
I've just been measured
for a suit by R.H. Macy.

14:43.685 --> 14:46.419
I think it will fit
the occasion well.

14:48.276 --> 14:50.357
There is
one last item.

14:50.359 --> 14:52.092
I'd very much like
det Corcoran

14:52.094 --> 14:54.394
to be placed
in charge of security.

14:54.396 --> 14:57.097
I'll rest easier,
knowing my guests and I

14:57.099 --> 15:00.901
are placed in his
strong, capable hands.

15:07.361 --> 15:09.328
Why don't we just
arrest the bastards

15:09.330 --> 15:11.697
before the event
even starts?

15:11.699 --> 15:13.166
If there's
a full out siege,

15:13.168 --> 15:14.734
we won't have
enough men.

15:14.736 --> 15:16.702
If we ain't got enough
men to stop a siege,

15:16.704 --> 15:18.604
then how are we going to
have enough men

15:18.606 --> 15:19.839
to make arrests?

15:19.841 --> 15:22.608
The Roderick gang has
twice the numbers as us.

15:22.610 --> 15:25.978
As long as we're dug in,
stick with the plan,

15:25.980 --> 15:27.780
we'll have
the upper hand.

15:27.782 --> 15:29.715
As requested by
Mrs. Haverford,

15:29.717 --> 15:31.417
I'll be in here,
actually watching

15:31.419 --> 15:33.586
the money, but there
ain't much we can do

15:33.588 --> 15:35.188
to lock up this room
without turning

15:35.190 --> 15:38.291
the whole damn house
into a prison.

15:38.293 --> 15:41.461
We're going to need
a man here at the front,

15:41.463 --> 15:44.363
a few patrolling
down the street,

15:44.365 --> 15:45.832
and we'll need
another man

15:45.834 --> 15:48.768
stationed
out the back.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.070
Put it down,
Francis.

15:55.042 --> 15:57.009
And a man up here,

15:57.011 --> 15:58.778
acting
as our eyes.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.948
If we see the
Roderick gang coming

16:01.950 --> 16:03.449
and know where
they're coming from,

16:03.451 --> 16:05.985
we can pick them off, just
like we did with his brother.

16:05.987 --> 16:08.688
And if we make it through, how
are we gonna get the money out?

16:08.690 --> 16:10.656
We race downtown...

16:13.294 --> 16:16.529
The Morehouses' to the bank
is a good 2 Miles.

16:16.531 --> 16:18.898
Once we reach Chatham, though,
that's O'Connell guard turf.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.566
Damn shame to survive
the Roderick gang,

16:20.568 --> 16:23.436
only to have the O'Connell
boys take us out.

16:23.438 --> 16:25.271
We'll strike
a deal...

16:26.774 --> 16:29.208

need you to speak

16:29.210 --> 16:31.144
with smiling Hugh
O'Connell.

16:31.146 --> 16:32.879
What am I to offer in
return for our own arses?

16:32.881 --> 16:34.747
Big Tim McManus
and little Tim are

16:34.749 --> 16:36.582
in the tombs.
We just let them go.

16:36.584 --> 16:39.719
Just don't tell smiling
Hugh about the money.

16:39.721 --> 16:43.089
Say that Corwyn's looking
to kill me that night.

16:43.091 --> 16:44.757

on the past.
