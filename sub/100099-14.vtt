WEBVTT

00:16.581 --> 00:20.020
Foul beast.
Plague of my family.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.196
Today your life ends.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.205
End simulation.

00:36.079 --> 00:38.690
These new Obsidian Platinum
lenses are amazing!

00:38.734 --> 00:41.389
Well, Kelly said the upgrade
is so realistic that people

00:41.432 --> 00:44.914
can actually touch and taste
and smell things in the VR.

00:44.957 --> 00:48.396
I mean, look at that guy.
He's actually feeling like
he's going that fast.

00:48.439 --> 00:49.571
He must be fearless.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.181
That would make
even me dizzy.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.878
Oh, hardly.

00:52.922 --> 00:56.708
But fearless
is definitely something
I wish I was feeling,

00:56.752 --> 00:59.407
'cause right now,
being out in this crowd,

00:59.450 --> 01:01.235
I don't like it
without my sidearm.

01:01.278 --> 01:05.239
I can't believe Lex
made you give up your gun
when you left the DEO.

01:05.282 --> 01:08.242
This is the first time
in eight years I've been
out without it.

01:08.285 --> 01:12.942
You know what? I love it.
You and J'onn, The Tower,
without bureaucracy.

01:12.985 --> 01:16.076
Without an evil overlord
holding you back.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.555
I think it's great.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.602
-Hi.
-Hi. Oh, my gosh!

01:20.645 --> 01:23.561
-Look at this place.
It's amazing!
-It's all Andrea.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.738
Well, okay, sure. Maybe
the pizzazz part, but I mean,

01:26.782 --> 01:30.133
not the upgraded 150
petaflop bio-link interface.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.787
She has never said
words like that.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.746
Oh, you are paying attention
to my late night ramblings.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.923
-I do listen. Yes.
-More importantly,
what's in the box?

01:37.967 --> 01:40.926
This is a first day gift
for my awesome girlfriend.

01:40.970 --> 01:43.407
Hot pockets,
macaroni and cheese

01:43.451 --> 01:45.235
and your favorite
dumplings from Wang Foo's.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.759
-Dumplings?
-Oh, no. Hey. Uh-uh.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.240
This is comfort food for me.

01:50.284 --> 01:53.635
-I might share with J'onn.
Maybe. If he asks.
-What?

01:53.678 --> 01:55.941
-I've been listen...
-Um, don't look now

01:55.985 --> 01:59.249
but the co-worker you rejected
is coming this way.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.772
-Don't look now.
-Oh.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.427
-Oh. You should do your thing.
-I gotta go to The Tower.

02:03.471 --> 02:06.474
-We have a thing
that we have to do.
-Traitors. Traitors!

02:06.517 --> 02:07.475
-Hi!
-Morning!

02:07.518 --> 02:08.606
Hello.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.608
-I come bearing lattes.
-Oh.

02:10.651 --> 02:13.176
-Sugar-free vanilla latte.
-Thank you.

02:13.220 --> 02:18.138
And for you, double caff,
double foam
with caramel and mocha.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.269
How did you know that?

02:19.313 --> 02:20.792
I'm an
investigative journalist.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.186
But don't we all know
our friends' orders by heart?

02:23.230 --> 02:25.797
This was very thoughtful
of you, thank you.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.843
-It was nothing.
See you guys there.
-Bye.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.672
-Bye.
-Wow.

02:30.715 --> 02:34.023
Rejection never looked so good
or was so cool about it.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.634
Why am I so bad at this?

02:36.678 --> 02:38.941
At 9:00 p.m. tonight,

02:38.984 --> 02:42.684
Obsidian will change
the way you think
and feel and experience life.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.730
The countdown to your
dreams starts now.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.871
Eleven hours and counting.
Exclamation point,
exclamation point.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.706
Help! Help!

03:13.715 --> 03:15.195
Are you okay?

03:15.238 --> 03:17.022
I am now.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.198
Thank you for saving me.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.331
What the hell happened?

03:21.375 --> 03:22.680
Someone tried
to kill you.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.682
-How did you know?
-Because of this.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.206
It was delivered
five minutes ago.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.208
It's an Anti-Obsidian
manifesto.

03:28.251 --> 03:31.515
"Obsidian North
is technological genocide.

03:31.559 --> 03:35.040
With Andrea Rojas now dead,
consider this
your final warning.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.608
Cancel the Obsidian Platinum
launch or more will die."

03:39.958 --> 03:43.919
He can threaten
whatever he wants.
I will not postpone.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.076
Well, isn't that cute?

04:11.120 --> 04:14.645
I wasn't aware
a Maladorian Dendroasp
could show any restraint.

04:16.168 --> 04:19.302
-And you two share
a lot in common.
-Hmm.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.913
Non Nocere does
what God couldn't.

04:21.957 --> 04:25.613
Turns the most ferocious animal
instincts into "do no harm."

04:25.656 --> 04:29.573
So far, all of your
animal trials have
produced perfect results.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.619
Yeah, but the human brain
is far more complex

04:31.662 --> 04:33.273
and I've yet to test it
to see that it's working

04:33.316 --> 04:34.926
just as perfectly.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.451
Can't have any critics
pouncing on any mistakes.

04:37.494 --> 04:41.455
Hmm. That has a bit
of a personal ring to it.

04:41.498 --> 04:45.981
Let me guess. Your biggest
critic is a Kryptonian?

04:46.024 --> 04:48.940
Before Crisis, when I tried to
use Myriad, she assumed that

04:48.984 --> 04:51.595
I was trying
to mind control people.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.163
Her and her friends think
I'm going down a dark path.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.947
They think
you've turned into me.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.775
Or at least, Mother.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.822
But you haven't... tragically.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.346
Can you imagine what it would
be like if humanity didn't

05:03.390 --> 05:05.435
succumb to terror,
rage and worry?

05:05.479 --> 05:08.003
We would be the best
versions of ourselves.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.962
-Be creative. Be free--
-Utopia.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.617
Exactly. But Supergirl and her
friends just can't accept that

05:13.661 --> 05:16.490
I don't want to
puppet master humanity.

05:16.533 --> 05:20.363
Since I anticipated
you being ready for
the next phase of testing,

05:20.407 --> 05:26.151
I took the liberty of setting
up a trial at that cute little
prison we own.

05:26.195 --> 05:30.634
Willing subjects waiting for
a chance to be better people.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.244
There's a car waiting
for you downstairs.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.511
Gotta go. Duty calls.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.473
Got your text.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.650
Good news on inverting
Toyman's Immortality Code
for use against Leviathan?

05:46.694 --> 05:50.350
Yes. I'm nearly done
re-purposing the code
to render Leviathan vulnerable,

05:50.393 --> 05:52.830
but seeing as how they are
a techno-organic species

05:52.874 --> 05:55.398
from the same
solar system as Krypton,

05:55.442 --> 05:57.357
I've calculated that it would
be next to impossible

05:57.400 --> 05:59.010
to inject
the code into their skin

05:59.054 --> 06:02.187
without first, somehow,
weakening them.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.493
So, are you saying
we would need to find

06:03.537 --> 06:05.539
their version of Kryptonite?

06:06.278 --> 06:07.367
In so many words, yes.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.629
Then no.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.021
I've been down that road
and let's just say,

06:10.065 --> 06:11.371
I didn't win.

06:11.414 --> 06:15.244
There is one
intriguing possibility.

06:15.287 --> 06:18.247
but that would require
access to Leviathan's
base of operations.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.292
Which we don't even know
the location of.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.686
Sir.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.080
There's been an attack
on Andrea Rojas.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.910
Despite a vicious attack,

06:28.953 --> 06:30.912
Andrea Rojas promised that

06:30.955 --> 06:33.697
the launch will proceed
as planned
at 9:00 p.m. tonight...

06:33.741 --> 06:35.046
This is terrible.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.526
Or fortuitous.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.746
We need to get closer
to Leviathan

06:38.789 --> 06:40.095
so that we can
find their home base

06:40.138 --> 06:42.053
to administer
the Mortality Code.

06:42.097 --> 06:45.274
Gemma Cooper is heavily
invested in both Andrea
and the launch,

06:45.317 --> 06:47.232
which will need protection.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.887
What better way
to get in with Leviathan

06:49.931 --> 06:52.324
than to protect
their favorite child?

06:52.934 --> 06:54.718
Call Supergirl.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.721
I am not a bodyguard, Lex.

06:57.765 --> 07:00.463
With you guarding her,
there is a 99.7% chance

07:00.507 --> 07:03.248
that Andrea survives
and her assailant is captured.

07:03.292 --> 07:06.556
Well, instead, why doesn't
the DEO track the terrorists

07:06.600 --> 07:07.905
before they attack again?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.254
When I rescued her
this morning,

07:09.298 --> 07:11.474
there was pink energy
surrounding the elevator.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.434
Pink energy would suggest
a Chlorophyllian.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.566
And their energy
is impossible to track.

07:16.610 --> 07:20.135
Finding them before
the launch tonight
seems unlikely.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.792
And if you refuse, you know
the leverage I have.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.142
Not to mention you'll have
the blood of a poor,

07:27.185 --> 07:29.274
innocent billionaire
on your hands.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.755
Platinum lets you be
whomever you want,

07:31.799 --> 07:33.627
whenever you want.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.763
We have more cases
than I care to count.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.287
Runaway aliens,
missing persons,

07:42.331 --> 07:44.812
and... the odd wayward spouse.

07:44.855 --> 07:48.293
And still no leads
on what Lex is up to.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.818
We will get to the bottom
of that, I promise you.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.386
Are you okay?

07:55.997 --> 07:57.477
I've had a clear mission

07:57.520 --> 07:59.783
and a boss to answer to

07:59.827 --> 08:02.482
every day of my life
since medical school.

08:02.525 --> 08:05.833
And now,
with all this freedom,

08:05.876 --> 08:08.488
-I'm just starting
to feel a little--
-Discombobulated.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.793
Yes.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.666
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.798
Lex just personally
assigned me

08:14.842 --> 08:16.191
to bodyguard Andrea Rojas

08:16.234 --> 08:17.801
until Platinum's launch
tonight.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.020
Bodyguard?

08:19.063 --> 08:20.804
Why does Lex care so much
about the launch?

08:20.848 --> 08:23.633
Exactly. He must have
an ulterior motive
against Obsidian.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.330
Or it's a trap.

08:25.374 --> 08:28.203
Well, either way,
I'll investigate
when I'm with Andrea,

08:28.246 --> 08:30.510
but I came here first
to see if you guys could help.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.163
Do you have any idea
who attacked Andrea?

08:32.207 --> 08:35.340
I saw pink energy
in the elevator
while it was falling.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.691
And Brainy says
it could be Chlorophyllian,

08:37.734 --> 08:40.563
but he also said their energy
is impossible to track, so...

08:40.607 --> 08:42.652
Chlorophyllians are
a peaceful race.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.393
They absorb sunlight
through their dermis

08:44.436 --> 08:46.003
in order to super-grow crops.

08:46.047 --> 08:49.050
They shouldn't be able
to siphon off
electrical energy.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.356
Still, it's a lead.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.836
We'll get on it.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.099
Well, if you need me
I'll be glued
to Andrea's side.

09:03.412 --> 09:06.023
You're a difficult woman
to track down.

09:06.067 --> 09:09.374
You being here
blocking my way
would suggest otherwise.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.159
I heard the terrible news.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.683
How perplexing
that terrorists were able
to breach your security.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.207
And you want to "help" me.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.209
How thoughtful.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.907
On such a momentous day
for your company

09:19.950 --> 09:22.213
I feel it's my civic duty.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.693
What could you
possibly give us

09:23.737 --> 09:25.390
that we can't give ourselves?

09:25.434 --> 09:26.740
Supergirl...

09:26.783 --> 09:28.263
For Andrea Rojas's protection.

09:28.306 --> 09:32.093
I don't need your Supergirl,
nor do I want her.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.095
Oh, I think you do.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.576
I know you prefer yourpeople

09:36.619 --> 09:39.056
to not be in the public eye,

09:39.100 --> 09:42.146
and, well, this launch... Wow.
Talk about the headlines.

09:43.626 --> 09:46.063
And if you know my people,

09:46.107 --> 09:48.065
you know what I can do
to a yappy little dog

09:48.109 --> 09:49.240
that nips at my heel.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.242
That's why I adore you.

09:51.286 --> 09:54.115
I can give you something
you value above all else...

09:54.158 --> 09:55.899
anonymity.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.119
The entire world will be
watching and recording

09:58.162 --> 10:01.252
Andrea Rojas' every move
until the launch at 9:00 p.m.

10:01.296 --> 10:04.255
Given the high-profile nature
of the situation,

10:04.299 --> 10:05.648
I'm the easy choice.

10:05.692 --> 10:09.434
I do admire your confidence,
Mr. Luthor.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.654
Always the over-achiever.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.525
I'll call off my friends.

10:17.312 --> 10:22.447
But be forewarned,
we don't give second chances.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.972
So don't make promises
you can't keep.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.331
All of these men volunteered?

10:36.374 --> 10:37.854
They did.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.117
It's a cross section
of inmates
from the most violent

10:40.161 --> 10:41.989
to those who are afraid
of their own shadow.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.297
What are you looking at?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.995
Nothing, nothing.
I'm sorry, Toby.

10:49.039 --> 10:49.866
Guards!

10:52.826 --> 10:54.218
Are you all right?

10:56.003 --> 10:57.657
It's nothing.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.310
That was practically
a high five,

10:59.354 --> 11:01.530
considering what he does
to me most days.

11:01.573 --> 11:02.792
How do you cope?

11:02.836 --> 11:04.664
It's prison.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.491
Guys like me
don't stand a chance.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.493
Five years in here
taught me that.

11:08.537 --> 11:12.019
But maybe after your trials,

11:12.062 --> 11:14.804
I won't have to worry.

11:14.848 --> 11:17.024
I've heard you're trying
to turn them

11:17.067 --> 11:18.808
peaceful as Quakers.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.984
If you succeed,

11:21.028 --> 11:24.858
that'd be a real godsend
for guys like me, Lena Luthor.

11:26.381 --> 11:27.861
Let's get started.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.169
Thank you for seeing
how important this is

11:32.213 --> 11:33.823
and having my back.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.259
With you by my side,

11:35.303 --> 11:36.870
people will be
even more amped
for the launch.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.523
Selfie?

11:38.567 --> 11:40.047
Uh...

11:40.090 --> 11:42.223
Hashtag SuperGuard.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.878
When is everyone
getting here?

11:44.921 --> 11:46.444
I cancelled the live audience.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.838
I won't risk innocent lives.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.710
And I won't give in to terror.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.233
Andrea!

11:52.276 --> 11:53.190
Natalia.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.192
Oh, my God, how are you?

11:55.236 --> 11:56.585
You must still be shaking.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.282
Oh, better now that I'm here.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.372
Pleasure to meet you,
Supergirl.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.765
William Dey.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.549
-We crossed paths this morning.
-Uh, yeah, yes.

12:04.593 --> 12:08.553
It's very nice to meet you...
formally.

12:08.597 --> 12:09.859
What are you doing here?

12:09.903 --> 12:12.079
I'm covering the Obsidian
North Platinum launch,

12:12.122 --> 12:14.037
and this is the first stop
on the press tour.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.258
You're following Andrea
around all day?

12:17.301 --> 12:20.783
Well, if someone attacks,
you could get hurt, or killed.

12:20.827 --> 12:21.915
I'm a journalist.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.220
We put ourselves
in harm's way

12:23.264 --> 12:24.569
to show our readers
the truth.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.745
How can I shy away
from danger

12:25.788 --> 12:27.790
when the people I cover can't?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.052
That's very heroic.

12:29.096 --> 12:32.403
Ah, I don't know about that,
but thank you.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.579
It's also a huge story.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.233
For better or worse,

12:36.277 --> 12:37.757
this launch
is the biggest thing

12:37.800 --> 12:39.628
since the invention
of the computer.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.631
Harry!

12:42.674 --> 12:44.459
-J'onn J'onzz!
-Hey, man.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.765
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

12:45.808 --> 12:46.809
What are you up to?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.811
We're looking for
a Chlorophyllian.

12:48.855 --> 12:49.769
You know any?

12:50.682 --> 12:51.814
Can't say that I do.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.817
But Dmitry over there,

12:54.861 --> 12:57.298
he knows everybody.
Might be worth a shot.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.778
-Thanks, man.
-Thanks.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.130
Hey, man.

13:03.652 --> 13:04.653
You!

13:05.480 --> 13:06.437
Get away from me.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.612
You two know each other?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.266
I might've roughed him up
once or twice

13:09.310 --> 13:10.790
while tracking a lead.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.835
It's not the arm-twisting
I'm worried about,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.619
it's the jail time
I did afterward

13:14.663 --> 13:15.838
that I'd like to avoid.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.493
Look, we're not here
to arrest you. Okay?

13:18.536 --> 13:20.277
I don't work for
the government anymore.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.496
We're gonna need your help.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.933
Look, we're looking for
a Chlorophyllian.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.500
Somebody with tech issues

13:25.543 --> 13:27.545
or possibly
an anger management
problem.

13:33.334 --> 13:37.164
I have a buddy
who engages in certain...

13:37.207 --> 13:40.167
less than legal
weapons transactions.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.646
He mentioned a Chlorophyllian

13:41.690 --> 13:44.345
asking about
some military-grade tech.

13:44.388 --> 13:47.478
The Chlorophyllian...
any ideas where
we can find him?

13:47.522 --> 13:50.003
My buddy was complaining
about making the trek out

13:50.046 --> 13:51.961
to a farmhouse on Route 89.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.180
Thank you.

13:53.223 --> 13:57.314
And I... I'm sorry
about last time.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.839
-She's sorry. Thanks.
-Yeah.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.842
This sounds
really bad, J'onn.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.713
I'm gonna call Brainy
and see what he can find.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.323
You sure that's wise?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.978
If Lex finds out
Brainy's using
DEO resources for you,

14:09.022 --> 14:10.762
it could put him
in Lex's crosshairs.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.329
-He's family. He'll let us
know if he can't.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.985
Brainy, hey.
We got a lead.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.769
That's excellent news.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.859
Can you see if there's
a Chlorophyllian living off
of Route 89?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.338
It's some kind of farm.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.863
I just need a name, address...
anything you can get.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.042
Unfortunately,
I see no record

14:29.085 --> 14:31.218
of any Chlorophyllians
living in that vicinity.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.350
In fact, the only farm
off Route 89

14:33.394 --> 14:35.396
has been liquidated
with no proof
of asset dispersion.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.398
Okay, thanks, Brainy.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.008
No dice.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.358
Ah, look, I still want
to track down that farm.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.751
Yeah, agreed.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.767
I apologize for
the intrusion.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.203
I'm here to help.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.250
Lex must ingratiate
himself with Gemma Cooper

15:03.293 --> 15:05.034
in order to defeat Leviathan.

15:05.078 --> 15:08.037
For that to happen,
Supergirl must save
Andrea Rojas.

15:08.081 --> 15:11.084
Therefore, Alex Danvers
and J'onn J'onzz need to be
left in the dark.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.737
I've done the calculations.

15:12.781 --> 15:16.393
There is
a 93.2% probability that

15:16.437 --> 15:18.613
none will invite me
to Thanksgiving...

15:20.006 --> 15:21.442
after I do what must be done.

15:21.485 --> 15:25.620
Yes, well, that is a quite
the conundrum, Querl.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.233
Alas, in a moment like this,

15:30.277 --> 15:32.235
there is only one thing
you can do.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.584
Trust the math.

15:33.628 --> 15:38.938
Your ultimate allegiance
must remain with Lex.

15:38.981 --> 15:42.767
Only then, will the future
unfold the way we need it to.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.639
Trust that your friends
are strong.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.468
I mean, they areheroes,
after all.

15:49.122 --> 15:52.255
And that is quantifiable.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.431
I desperately hope
you're right.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.347
Man, that is a nice haircut.

15:58.348 --> 15:59.697
Shut up.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.617
Non Nocere program
uploading.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.315
Let's see if this works.

16:09.838 --> 16:12.493
Gentlemen, stand
and remove your lenses.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.544
Yo, Steve, come here.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.160
Do you wanna grab
some grub?

16:28.552 --> 16:31.468
Uh, sure, Toby...

16:31.512 --> 16:33.470
That would be lovely.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.515
Yeah.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.348
You're a genius.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.875
...as a testament to the people
who are standing up
to these threats.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.050
What do you make of all this?

16:48.703 --> 16:50.661
How do you mean?

16:50.705 --> 16:53.316
The culprit, the manifesto,
the whole situation?

16:53.360 --> 16:55.101
Off the record, of course.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.191
I think it's horrible.
People should never
resort to violence.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.846
-But...
-I hate to say it,

17:01.890 --> 17:05.502
but I think the manifesto
makes some slightly
decent points.

17:05.546 --> 17:09.854
I mean, not that
"Obsidian Lenses will take
our sentient minds hostage."

17:09.897 --> 17:13.510
But that people
disconnecting from
the real world

17:13.554 --> 17:17.165
could backfire
in unforeseen ways,

17:17.210 --> 17:19.429
creating irreparable damage.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.390
What do you think?

17:24.391 --> 17:26.219
The way I look at it,

17:26.262 --> 17:28.047
Obsidian North's
biggest appeal is that

17:28.089 --> 17:31.180
it taps into people's desire
to feel connected.

17:31.224 --> 17:34.053
And when you
only live in that VR world,

17:34.096 --> 17:37.752
you end up getting
further and further away
from the real world.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.408
You've thought a lot
about this.

17:41.451 --> 17:44.759
When the first generation
lenses dropped, I was buzzing.

17:44.802 --> 17:48.545
I thought about being able
to hang with my buddy
who I lost a few years ago.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.373
But it wasn't until
I hung out with my friend,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.201
or, co-worker, Kara,

17:52.245 --> 17:57.424
that I remembered what
being really connected
feels like.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.209
All it took was some karaoke
and a game night.

18:00.253 --> 18:04.953
But I realized
I didn't want to live in
some perfect VR world,

18:04.996 --> 18:07.434
I just wanted to be with
the people I care about.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.969
Andrea Rojas!

18:34.330 --> 18:38.421
Ms. Rojas, we need to
get you to a secure location.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.206
I am not running away.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.946
You were just attacked
by someone who can
travel through light.

18:41.990 --> 18:45.428
Then it's good
that saving people
is what you do best.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.127
And Obsidian...
It's what I do best.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.478
It's my life.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.829
It's my father's, too.

18:58.006 --> 19:01.531
This company
is his life's work.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.970
Mi papábuilt it
from the ground up.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.147
He sacrificed everything,
and...

19:12.020 --> 19:14.457
...and so did I.

19:14.501 --> 19:17.286
I've done things to help him
restore Obsidian to glory.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.158
Things I'm not proud of,

19:20.202 --> 19:22.030
and things I can never undo.

19:23.336 --> 19:26.034
I pushed away friends
for my own gain...

19:28.036 --> 19:30.212
But I would do it all again
in a heartbeat.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.997
I will not stop

19:33.041 --> 19:34.695
just because someone
is threatening me.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.527
Your next appearance
is downtown

19:40.570 --> 19:42.485
at the Obsidian store pop-up.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.184
I will have to do a sweep
of the area, twice,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.229
and I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.712
Thank you, Supergirl.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.328
Hi, Steve.

19:59.372 --> 20:02.070
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
for whatever I did.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.072
Everything okay?

20:06.727 --> 20:08.946
No, it's not.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.559
I'm not okay!

20:19.740 --> 20:21.742
Steve! Steve!

20:22.264 --> 20:23.744
Get a medic!

20:25.746 --> 20:27.095
Steve?

20:28.923 --> 20:29.793
Can you hear me?

20:30.577 --> 20:32.535
You had a reaction.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.885
It caused
a grand mal seizure.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.583
Do you remember what happened?

20:40.108 --> 20:41.588
It was Toby.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.287
I thought
he was going to hit me.

20:46.941 --> 20:50.074
When he asked me
if I was okay...

20:50.118 --> 20:52.729
I felt something

20:52.773 --> 20:54.949
I'd never felt before.

20:55.602 --> 20:56.951
For...

20:57.778 --> 21:00.955
For the first time... ever,

21:02.957 --> 21:05.742
I wanted to be the bully.

21:05.786 --> 21:08.615
Fear is the only emotion
I've known for most of my life,

21:08.658 --> 21:14.142
but then you came along
and I... finally felt hope.

21:16.318 --> 21:19.278
But now, all I feel is

21:20.322 --> 21:24.152
a hunger for revenge,

21:25.849 --> 21:27.808
for violence...

21:28.809 --> 21:31.290
It's trapped inside me,

21:31.333 --> 21:34.815
it's trying to
claw its way out,
I can't get rid of it.

21:34.858 --> 21:38.297
It's so much worse
than anything that Toby
ever did to me.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.820
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.605
You fixed those monsters,

21:42.649 --> 21:45.478
but what about me?
Why didn't you fix me?

21:45.521 --> 21:48.307
I will fix it, okay?
I promise. I promise!

21:54.008 --> 21:55.792
You know, I could have
phased us both through.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.838
Yeah, but I really missed
kicking doors in.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.452
Whoever this belongs to
has himself a green thumb.

22:03.496 --> 22:04.975
Just like a Chlorophyllian.

22:05.019 --> 22:08.196
Walden Pond... an idealized
return to nature.

22:09.371 --> 22:12.809
Certainly jives
with the manifesto.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.334
"Our inventions are wont
to be pretty toys,

22:15.377 --> 22:18.162
which distract our attention
from serious things."

22:18.206 --> 22:19.642
Look at these schematics.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.470
Looks like he has
a pretty toy all of his own.

22:21.514 --> 22:24.168
These are weapons-grade
components.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.997
This is what
he must've been trying
to buy on the black market.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.825
Some kind of gauntlet.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.827
I want you by my side
at all times. Got it?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.046
You're the boss.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.661
Hello, everyone!

22:38.705 --> 22:42.012
Which of you is ready
to change your life?

22:49.933 --> 22:51.544
You shouldn't be here.

22:52.588 --> 22:53.720
Watch out!

23:20.921 --> 23:22.096
Hey...

23:25.273 --> 23:26.753
Supergirl.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.929
We need to go, now.

23:33.586 --> 23:36.806
What? Wait,
you can't leave me here!

23:45.467 --> 23:47.469
Are you okay?

23:47.513 --> 23:50.254
I think so.
-What happened?

23:50.298 --> 23:52.431
Whoever it was,
they were able to take
my powers

23:52.474 --> 23:53.736
and use them against me.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.477
Is that something
Chlorophyllians can even do?

23:55.521 --> 23:57.566
Not at all.
Must be those gauntlets.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.438
They're enhancing
their abilities,

23:59.481 --> 24:01.440
allowing them to harness
any form of energy,

24:01.483 --> 24:03.311
including the powers
of other aliens.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.445
Well, Andrea is safe
at the DEO.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.924
Let's see if we can
salvage something.

24:07.968 --> 24:08.795
Right.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.761
I'd say
go easy on that thing,

24:18.805 --> 24:22.286
but if it takes
the pressure off,
you may as well.

24:22.330 --> 24:25.115
Do you remember when
you turned the sun red,

24:25.159 --> 24:26.377
what you told me?

24:28.510 --> 24:30.338
You told me
that you were doing it

24:30.381 --> 24:32.601
for the good
of the human race.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.951
You deluded yourself
into thinking
you were saving us,

24:34.995 --> 24:36.170
when you were really
killing us.

24:36.213 --> 24:39.478
And maybe I'm just
as deluded as you are.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.611
I haven't been deluded
a day in my life.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.178
You want to know
what I remember?

24:44.221 --> 24:47.137
You showed up at my office
with the Man of Tomorrow award.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.357
It was the last time
you were ever proud of me.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.620
We had just made
first contact with
an alien race

24:51.664 --> 24:53.970
and you didn't care.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.972
You didn't see the threat.

24:56.016 --> 25:00.150
You just wanted to focus
on the more philanthropic
efforts of Luthor Corp.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.544
And I fired you for it.

25:02.588 --> 25:03.980
Why are you telling me this?

25:04.024 --> 25:06.809
Because you're going down
the same path I did,

25:06.853 --> 25:08.724
and you are better than that.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.640
Superman was my downfall.

25:11.684 --> 25:14.643
I let my obsession
with destroying him
drive me off-course,

25:14.687 --> 25:16.993
but now I have
a second chance

25:17.037 --> 25:19.735
to do things the right way,
with you.

25:21.563 --> 25:24.174
Non Nocere was supposed
to liberate people,

25:24.218 --> 25:26.655
not take away their free will.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.004
But all I've managed to do

25:28.048 --> 25:29.528
is to trap people
in their own bodies

25:29.571 --> 25:32.661
with their ugliest
inclinations.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.708
Maybe I have gone down
a dark path.

25:35.751 --> 25:39.886
Don't let your obsession
with what Supergirl thinks
get in your way.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.192
You can't change
what's in her heart any more

25:42.236 --> 25:43.716
than you can change mine.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.848
But unlike her,

25:45.892 --> 25:47.720
I believe in
what you're doing.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.680
We'll figure this out
together,

25:51.724 --> 25:54.291
and I'm not leaving
until we do.

25:57.425 --> 25:58.905
Pull up the algorithm.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.265
You wanna talk?

26:13.659 --> 26:16.096
We almost died today
because I couldn't save us.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.707
I don't have freeze breath

26:18.751 --> 26:21.275
and I can't
phase through things.

26:22.450 --> 26:23.930
But it didn't even
matter before then

26:23.973 --> 26:27.237
because I had this
entire team that was behind me.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.065
I turned in my gun
and my badge

26:29.109 --> 26:31.764
so that I could stop Lex
from the outside.

26:32.939 --> 26:35.115
I thought the DEO
was holding me back,

26:36.290 --> 26:37.900
but what if it was
holding me up?

26:37.944 --> 26:40.163
Alex, when I left the DEO,

26:40.773 --> 26:42.426
I was lost, too.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.299
But you came to me
at a real low point

26:45.342 --> 26:48.084
and you reminded me that
sometimes it takes a while

26:48.128 --> 26:50.304
to grow into
the new version of yourself.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.350
It's a process, Alex.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.092
And today is the first day.

26:56.136 --> 26:58.617
Give yourself time
to recalibrate.

26:58.660 --> 27:02.446
And in the meantime,
just know that we all
have your back.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.665
I found something.

27:07.669 --> 27:08.975
What'd you get?

27:10.193 --> 27:13.936
"Todd Sapphire."
He worked for Obsidian?

27:13.980 --> 27:16.765
Looks like Sapphire had
someone he cared deeply about.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.332
What happened
to him?

27:20.987 --> 27:23.816
According to Obsidian HR,

27:23.859 --> 27:26.296
he became addicted
to the virtual reality lenses

27:26.340 --> 27:30.126
and was terminated
because he stole a pair
for an all-night binge.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.782
Could the attack
on Andrea be retaliation
for getting fired?

27:33.826 --> 27:35.479
This is a suicide note.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.960
Addressed to "My darling Amy.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.180
I'm sorry I could not be
stronger for you, my love,

27:40.223 --> 27:43.662
but ever since we left
our home world
I have felt lost

27:43.705 --> 27:46.142
and the only relief
I've found is in VR.

27:46.186 --> 27:50.059
I'm so homesick
I can't think of anything else.
I can't go on."

27:53.846 --> 27:54.977
Wait a minute.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.370
He died a year ago.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.853
So if he's dead,
then he couldn't have
attacked Andrea...

28:02.028 --> 28:05.988
Then was it his wife?

28:06.032 --> 28:08.338
She blames
Obsidian for his death.

28:08.382 --> 28:11.994
And the manifesto warned
against making VR
a new paradise...

28:12.038 --> 28:13.387
Amy is trying
to stop the launch

28:13.430 --> 28:15.519
to save people
from her husband's fate.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.521
The launch
is in 27 minutes.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.175
I have to get
to CatCo.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.047
Get out if you wanna live!

28:29.403 --> 28:30.404
You!

28:31.753 --> 28:33.407
Where is Andrea Rojas?

28:33.450 --> 28:35.017
She's not here.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.366
Leave these people alone.

28:36.410 --> 28:37.890
I'm stopping the launch.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.723
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.073
This ends now.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.905
I'm sorry.
I can't let you stop me.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.746
It's time to put
your toys to bed.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.405
-Are you okay?
- I will be.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.233
Get everyone out of here.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.626
I'll go after Amy.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.109
Director Dox,
we're receiving reports

29:23.152 --> 29:24.806
of a terrorist event
at Obsidian.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.242
And a massive power outage

29:26.286 --> 29:28.070
that seems to be
spreading across the city.

29:28.114 --> 29:31.465
The launch,
the whole Platinum cloud,
has a failsafe.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.249
If power is drained
from our generators,

29:33.293 --> 29:36.078
the failsafe pulls power
from the city's grid
to ensure the launch.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.080
The Luthor PowerCore?

29:38.124 --> 29:40.909
That system reacquires energy
as rapidly as it is lost.

29:40.953 --> 29:43.259
If power continues
to deplete at this rate--

29:43.303 --> 29:45.479
It could not only cause
a massive blackout
to National City,

29:45.522 --> 29:48.264
but could also cause
the majority of
its transformers to explode.

29:48.308 --> 29:49.657
Fire, chaos...

29:53.835 --> 29:56.098
I have to get to CatCo
and take the failsafe offline.

29:56.142 --> 29:58.797
No. It's too dangerous.
I'll go.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.625
Please,
take me with you.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.846
Supergirl promised
Mr. Luthor that you would
stay out of danger.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.674
Put her in a holding cell.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.985
Come on. Come on.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.337
Go! Go!

30:17.903 --> 30:19.208
Please stop!

30:19.252 --> 30:21.123
If you destroy
the processor
it will explode.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.646
I don't intend to destroy it.

30:22.690 --> 30:23.996
I just need it to stop.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.350
Hi.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.178
Hi.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.229
Follow me,
I'll get you all to safety.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.844
Now, quickly.
Let's go! Let's go!

31:08.388 --> 31:09.737
Amy, no!

31:23.403 --> 31:25.709
No, no, no, no.
This can't be right!

31:25.753 --> 31:26.928
Let me go!

31:26.972 --> 31:28.756
Please. I need
to get to CatCo.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.559
Amy, please, you can't
go through with this.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.039
You don't have
any power to stop me.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.041
You're right. I'm powerless.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.217
So blast me again
if you want to.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.741
But I know about Todd.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.569
I know how much
you loved each other.

31:59.613 --> 32:03.573
And I know
what dark spiral
he went down

32:03.617 --> 32:06.054
after he got addicted
to Obsidian's VR.

32:06.098 --> 32:10.058
But Amy, just as Todd
became obsessed
with a virtual world,

32:10.102 --> 32:14.410
you have become obsessed
with finding justice for him.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.935
No one else should suffer
the way I did.

32:19.459 --> 32:20.939
Oh, my God.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.070
You shouldn't be here.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.593
Who released you
from custody?

32:23.637 --> 32:24.812
It's not working.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.945
Someone built a failsafe
into the failsafe

32:26.988 --> 32:27.989
to secure the launch.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.252
I read your manifesto...

32:30.296 --> 32:34.082
Your point that people
would rather live in
a virtual world

32:34.126 --> 32:36.606
than actually help
the real world,

32:36.650 --> 32:38.130
I hear that.

32:38.173 --> 32:39.522
I hear you.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.308
It's built to trap you.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.788
An addiction.
That's what it did to Todd.

32:44.832 --> 32:46.616
I know.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.271
But if you go through
with what you're doing,

32:49.315 --> 32:51.621
it won't just shut down
the launch.

32:51.665 --> 32:54.624
Innocent people will die.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.452
I know you don't want that.

32:56.496 --> 32:59.281
What you want
is for people to engage.

32:59.325 --> 33:02.806
For people to know
what it's like to be
in the outside world.

33:02.850 --> 33:06.506
To be a partner, to love,
to have friends.

33:07.507 --> 33:10.118
Nothing can change the past.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.902
Believe me, I've tried.

33:14.035 --> 33:17.299
But you are in control
of your own future.

33:17.343 --> 33:19.867
Todd may not be here anymore,
but you are.

33:19.910 --> 33:22.304
Just look deep
inside yourself and think,

33:22.348 --> 33:25.699
is thiswhat Todd
would have really wanted?

33:52.552 --> 33:54.380
I miss him every day.

34:04.216 --> 34:07.175
How did you get back here
so fast from the DEO?

34:07.219 --> 34:09.221
I convinced some agents
to bring me.

34:11.092 --> 34:15.531
Todd Sapphire became
addicted to a proto version
of Obsidian VR.

34:15.574 --> 34:18.360
Maybe you should
slow down the rollout.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.710
Todd's story was tragic,

34:20.754 --> 34:23.364
but he's not
the only story out there.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.541
After the attack tonight,
do you know what happened?

34:25.585 --> 34:30.068
Our employees used our VR
to cope with the trauma
they'd just experienced.

34:31.591 --> 34:34.202
Bottom line, Supergirl,

34:34.246 --> 34:36.596
I'm here to help people.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.120
Remember that.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.610
Acrata...
power through shadows.

35:04.972 --> 35:07.627
Well, Alex, you made it
through your first day.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.152
Still no leads
on Lex though.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.460
This is gonna be
a long road, Alex.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.594
-And I think...

35:18.638 --> 35:22.120
...you are gonna need...
some backup.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.776
My gun.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.778
Not quite.

35:28.822 --> 35:33.827
Back on Mars we called this...

35:35.002 --> 35:36.656
...or "hand of the soldier."

35:37.831 --> 35:39.963
It can transform
into any weapon.

35:40.007 --> 35:41.269
-What?
-You just have to picture it

35:41.313 --> 35:42.531
in your mind's eye.

35:53.063 --> 35:56.154
Look, I know
you don't have a badge,

35:56.197 --> 35:58.025
but today you proved
you didn't need one.

35:59.679 --> 36:00.854
J'onn, this is amazing.

36:00.897 --> 36:03.161
-I don't know what to say.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.162
Thank you.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.165
With a little practice

36:08.035 --> 36:09.689
you'll learn to control it.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.212
Yeah.

36:22.528 --> 36:23.877
It's gone.

36:26.271 --> 36:29.404
All that pain...

36:30.362 --> 36:31.537
The hunger.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.582
Those feelings, it's as if...

36:35.367 --> 36:36.890
I never had them.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.329
How did you do that?

36:41.373 --> 36:44.027
My brother, of all people,

36:44.071 --> 36:46.508
helped me focus on
what really mattered.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.858
I had accounted
for violent tendencies,

36:48.902 --> 36:50.512
but not the feelings
of injustice

36:50.556 --> 36:52.384
which activate
a different part of the brain.

36:52.427 --> 36:55.517
So it was just a matter
of tweaking the algorithm
to account for that.

36:55.561 --> 36:58.128
Well, whatever you did,
it worked.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.742
For the first time in maybe...

37:03.917 --> 37:04.918
ever...

37:08.269 --> 37:10.228
I feel safe.

37:10.271 --> 37:13.231
You really are the hero
people say you are.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.407
If this works, the world
won't need heroes.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.110
-That's so cool.
So, it's Martian?
-Yeah.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.721
Well, I mean,
it's really a gun though.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.071
Or I mean, whatever weapon
I want it to be.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.899
J'onn just has to train me
how to use it.

37:29.943 --> 37:33.076
Well, even without it today
you were pretty badass.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.557
Who says you need
a badge and the DEO?

37:35.601 --> 37:37.124
-That's right.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.257
Oh! William.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.389
"I couldn't find you
after the attack.
Are you okay?"

37:41.433 --> 37:43.391
That is none of your business.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.394
I really need to text him back.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.745
I mean, it sounds like
he still really likes you.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.399
Are you regretting
saying no?

37:51.443 --> 37:53.401
I don't know.

37:53.445 --> 37:56.926
I've been so preoccupied
with people using VR
to escape the real world,

37:56.970 --> 37:59.581
when that's exactly
what I'm doing with William.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.280
I'm avoiding my own reality.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.282
Well, it sounds like
you know what
you need to do.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.286
It's just one dinner, right?

38:09.156 --> 38:10.288
Yeah.

38:17.643 --> 38:18.774
I'm alive.

38:18.818 --> 38:21.603
Kara! Oh, thank God.

38:21.647 --> 38:24.432
I heard you got out
but it's much better to...

38:24.476 --> 38:26.434
-...see for myself.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.131
Yeah. By the time I had
gotten your messages,

38:28.175 --> 38:29.959
I figured
it was easier to just

38:30.003 --> 38:31.352
show you proof of life.

38:31.396 --> 38:32.484
Yeah, sure.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.443
So how did you know
I was here?

38:35.487 --> 38:37.489
Well, it's common knowledge
you're a night owl

38:37.532 --> 38:38.881
and a workaholic,

38:38.925 --> 38:41.797
and one of the most
dedicated reporters I know.

38:41.841 --> 38:45.018
I think you give me
a run for my money there.

38:46.498 --> 38:49.327
Oh, God, this is too much,
isn't it?

38:49.370 --> 38:52.634
The coffee, the texts,
the compliments.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.332
I'm sorry, you asked
to be friends

38:54.375 --> 38:55.637
and I should be
respecting that,

38:55.681 --> 38:57.160
but instead I've been
overstepping all day.

38:57.204 --> 38:58.814
No, no, no. Not at all.

38:58.858 --> 38:59.989
It's fine.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.861
That's actually why
I'm here.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.473
I made a mistake last week

39:05.517 --> 39:07.519
because I was scared.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.999
You're a great guy.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.479
More than a great guy.

39:11.523 --> 39:14.352
And... And I would
love to go out.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.225
I would love that.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.495
There's my favorite Coluan.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.018
The progress you've made
inverting the code,

39:29.062 --> 39:30.716
-looks like a real killer.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.718
Don't you just love it
when a plan comes together?

39:37.723 --> 39:39.202
What? You don't love it?

39:39.246 --> 39:41.857
I encountered
your Luthor PowerCore
this evening

39:41.901 --> 39:44.382
and was unable
to take it offline.

39:44.425 --> 39:48.516
I texted you for assistance
and I got no reply.

39:48.560 --> 39:52.868
That failsafe
endangered 67%
of National City's population.

39:52.912 --> 39:54.870
So a few houses
could've burned down.

39:54.914 --> 39:56.045
Small price for progress.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.047
People could have died.

39:58.091 --> 39:59.397
If Supergirl hadn't--

39:59.440 --> 40:00.572
But she did.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.402
Have you forgotten,
Director Dox?

40:04.445 --> 40:07.056
Supergirl always
saves the day.

40:07.100 --> 40:10.712
Saving Obsidian Platinum
solidified our worth
to our new friends.

40:13.149 --> 40:15.413
Gotta go. Time to close.

40:22.115 --> 40:24.247
Forgive me for
keeping you waiting.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.075
You should be more considerate.

40:26.119 --> 40:29.252
When you make promises,
those around you
expect you to keep them.

40:29.296 --> 40:32.255
I know that
to the untrained eye,

40:32.299 --> 40:34.432
-today did not seem ideal.
-Oh.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.564
Fires, police, superheroes.

40:36.608 --> 40:40.916
Which part of this
do you consider not ideal?

40:40.960 --> 40:43.615
I believe that a woman with
your wisdom and foresight

40:43.658 --> 40:46.966
would see that we delivered
the results you desired,

40:47.009 --> 40:48.968
we just did it with panache.

40:49.011 --> 40:52.101
And without you having
to stick out your pretty neck.

40:52.145 --> 40:55.278
But I believe fate
has thrown us together.

40:55.322 --> 40:59.979
Me, the most trusted
and beloved man on Earth...

41:00.022 --> 41:02.111
Who better to represent
Obsidian Platinum

41:02.155 --> 41:05.027
in its worldwide rollout
than Lex Luthor?

41:06.333 --> 41:09.118
I'm the chocolate
to your peanut butter.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.598
With me as
your global ambassador,

41:10.642 --> 41:13.775
there won't be an eyeball
from Tokyo to Tajikistan

41:13.819 --> 41:15.342
without Obsidian lenses
on it.

41:16.822 --> 41:19.477
You make
a persuasive case, Lex.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.826
Hmm, as I told you,

41:20.869 --> 41:22.784
I can be an excellent
friend when I want to be.

41:22.828 --> 41:24.830
And I want to be
very good friends.

41:26.179 --> 41:27.354
So tell me this...

41:28.181 --> 41:29.965
As a friend,

41:30.009 --> 41:33.012
do you expect something
in return?

41:33.055 --> 41:35.884
It would be lovely
to meet your friends.

41:38.844 --> 41:40.672
Make good on your word,

41:41.542 --> 41:43.196
and we can discuss.
