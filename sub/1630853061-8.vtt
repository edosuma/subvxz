17:17.645 --> 17:19.821
and I hadn't slept all night.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.041
- Randall, what are you doing?

17:23.172 --> 17:25.000
- Sorry, I got carried away.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.655
So you win your first match.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.048
That must have felt incredible.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.746
- Oh, it did, but, you know,
more than the joy,

17:31.789 --> 17:34.227
it was standing
in the middle of that ring

17:34.270 --> 17:35.924
and feeling the crowd, and...

17:35.967 --> 17:37.969
for the first time
in my life,

17:38.013 --> 17:39.536
I felt like I was home.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.408
[cheers and applause]
- Great job, dude.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.149
- [laughs]
Great job.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.411
- Good job, man.
- Thank you guys.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.674
Thank you, sir.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.676
- Bro, did you hear that?
They popped!

17:48.719 --> 17:49.720
- Yeah, what does that mean?

17:49.764 --> 17:51.157
- It means
they gave a crap,

17:51.200 --> 17:52.636
and they cheered
when you won.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.551
- Thank you.
I won't ever forget this.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.987
- Hey, you know
what this watch says?

17:56.031 --> 17:57.685
Six minutes exactly.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.122
- Hey!
- Just like your wedding night.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.167
[laughs]

18:01.210 --> 18:02.516
Dewey, follow me.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.300
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.693
- People are impressed.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.261
They can't believe
it's your first match.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.393
- I haven't felt
anything like this.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.699
- Vince wants you to come
to the TV taping

18:11.742 --> 18:13.135
in San Antonio
tomorrow.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.397
- Yes, sir.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.964
- See you there, kid.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.836
- So what happened
in San Antonio?

18:18.880 --> 18:20.534
- Well, I had
my second dark match,

18:20.577 --> 18:22.492
which I lost,
but it went great.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.494
And after that,
I was summoned

18:24.538 --> 18:27.584
to the WWE headquarters
in Stamford, Connecticut,

18:27.628 --> 18:30.761
to have a one-on-one meeting
with Vince McMahon,

18:30.805 --> 18:33.721
which I was told could be more
intimidating than any match.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.027
But, uh, I really wanted
to impress Vince,

18:36.071 --> 18:38.334
so I wore the best outfit

18:38.378 --> 18:40.597
that a broke-ass kid
with seven bucks

18:40.641 --> 18:41.685
could put together:

18:41.729 --> 18:44.123
my finest mom jeans,

18:44.166 --> 18:46.168
a five-year-old
Tommy Hilfiger shirt,

18:46.212 --> 18:48.301
and a pair
of custom snakeskin boots

18:48.344 --> 18:50.781
that I got up in Calgary.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.568
[knocking]
- Dwayne, thanks for coming.

18:54.611 --> 18:55.656
- No problem.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.484
- Great to see you.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.442
Oh, nice boots.
- Yeah.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.052
- Hope you didn't get 'em
custom for this meeting.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.576
- No, I can't afford boots
like these.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.099
They were free.
- Ah.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.057
- I got them with a coupon
from Jeff Garcia's gift bag

19:06.101 --> 19:07.320
when I was in the CFL.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.364
- Can't beat free.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.844
- Yeah.
- Come on.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.106
[sighs]

19:11.150 --> 19:14.240
Dwayne, I think you have
a lot of potential.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.503
I mean, you are
a complete natural out there.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.592
- Thank you.
- You did great.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.507
But you're not ready
for the WWF.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.378
[somber music]

19:22.422 --> 19:23.727
- Okay.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.512
- Which is why
I'm sending you to Memphis.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.949
- Memphis, that's, uh,
Jerry Lawler's promotion.

19:27.992 --> 19:28.776
- Exactly.

19:28.819 --> 19:29.907
You'll go down there,

19:29.951 --> 19:31.387
learn the fundamentals,
you know,

19:31.431 --> 19:33.346
ring psychology,
how to cut a promo.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.738
When you're ready,

19:34.782 --> 19:36.827
we'll call you back up
to the WWF.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.960
- Some wrestlers
stayed in Memphis for months,

19:39.003 --> 19:39.787
some for years.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.223
Some never got the call.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.052
But I wasn't fazed,
because this was my shot.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.662
Thank you so much, Vince.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.230
And again, truly grateful
for this opportunity.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.232
- You got a car as nice
as those boots?

19:50.276 --> 19:52.016
- Uh, no, the last car I had

19:52.060 --> 19:53.757
had a homeless guy
living in it.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.803
- [laughs]
Well, get one.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.631
You're gonna be driving
all over the territory.

19:57.674 --> 19:58.806
- No problem.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.808
- You got a place to stay
in Memphis?

20:00.851 --> 20:03.593
- Yeah, I have family there.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.338
- Welcome home, brother.

20:09.382 --> 20:12.080
[laughs]

20:12.123 --> 20:15.431
[groans]
Oh, there he is. There he is.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.520
You're looking sharp, man.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.043
Well, come on.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.916
- [snoring]

20:21.959 --> 20:23.700
- Sweet dreams, big prince.

20:27.617 --> 20:30.490
Oh, uh, I didn't just kiss you.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.844
[birds chirping]

20:37.671 --> 20:39.455
Ah!
- Ah.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.327
- Finally The Rock
has come back...

20:41.370 --> 20:42.719
both: To his kitchen.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.068
- Oh, that was awesome.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.113
- [laughs]

20:45.156 --> 20:46.680
I feel so much better,

20:46.723 --> 20:48.072
and I want to apologize
for yesterday.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.596
I know we lost
a crucial day

20:49.639 --> 20:51.119
in the homestretch
of this campaign.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.687
- Actually, sir, no,
we didn't miss a beat.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.819
General Jackson,
freshly out of the hospital

20:55.863 --> 20:57.517
after her incident
in Tennessee,

20:57.560 --> 20:58.561
stepped in
for all of your events.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.389
- Your VP did "Meet the Press,"

21:00.433 --> 21:02.304
visited a construction site,

21:02.348 --> 21:03.697
and ran a half marathon.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.699
- Ah, so she answered

21:05.742 --> 21:07.744
the call.
- She answered the call.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.224
Damn it, thought we could go
two-for-two

21:09.268 --> 21:11.357
with the in-unison statements.
- Mm.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.314
Mm, try it again?

21:12.358 --> 21:13.707
- Yeah.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.883
- So she answered the call.
- So she an--

21:15.926 --> 21:17.188
- No, it's not there.

21:17.232 --> 21:18.233
We lost the moment.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.148
- So she answered the--
- Nope.
