00:00.188 --> 00:01.937
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...
</i>

00:01.968 --> 00:04.507
- Someone shot her.
- Artie killed Leena.

00:04.555 --> 00:06.790
We've all been whammied
at some point, right?

00:06.824 --> 00:08.058
I cast you out.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.281
Claudia, no!

00:09.320 --> 00:10.894
You separated the evil
from Artie.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.896
You knew the world
needed saving

00:12.930 --> 00:17.100
even if it cost you the only
father you've ever known.

00:17.135 --> 00:18.835
Holy metaphor.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.104
- Artie's brain is...
- The Warehouse.

00:21.139 --> 00:22.272
What's wrong?

00:22.306 --> 00:25.876
It's reality
finding its way in.

00:25.910 --> 00:28.111
It's the fight
that matters, Artie.

00:28.146 --> 00:29.946
Now go.

00:29.981 --> 00:31.848
No!

00:31.883 --> 00:34.584
Yes!

00:34.619 --> 00:36.119
I have something to say.

00:36.154 --> 00:38.355
Ever since
I started working here,

00:38.389 --> 00:41.625
what I thought I knew
about the world,

00:41.659 --> 00:44.561
it--it changes
pretty much every day.

00:44.595 --> 00:47.264
Artie did what he did
with the astrolabe

00:47.298 --> 00:50.467
to save Warehouse 13.

00:50.501 --> 00:52.869
To save all of us.

00:52.904 --> 00:56.573
As far as we know,
to save the whole damn world.

00:56.607 --> 01:00.410
Sometimes artifacts,

01:00.445 --> 01:05.515
they--they can do terrible,
unspeakable things to people.

01:05.550 --> 01:06.583
I mean, heck,
one time an artifact

01:06.617 --> 01:07.818
made me think
I slept with Myka.

01:07.852 --> 01:10.454
- Pete!
- Exactly.

01:10.488 --> 01:13.657
What happened
after the astrolabe--

01:13.691 --> 01:17.661
Brother Adrian, the stolen
artifacts, the orchid...

01:17.695 --> 01:21.832
Leena--

01:21.866 --> 01:24.501
That wasn't Artie.

01:24.535 --> 01:27.137
What I know about the world,

01:27.171 --> 01:30.507
it changes every day.

01:30.541 --> 01:32.342
There's one thing
that doesn't change.

01:32.376 --> 01:37.414
Warehouse 13 does not work
without this man.

01:37.448 --> 01:39.616
We need him.

01:39.650 --> 01:42.352
You need him.

01:44.755 --> 01:46.823
Thank you, Agent Lattimer.

01:46.858 --> 01:49.192
But we'd already
come to the same conclusion.

01:49.227 --> 01:51.895
Wha--oh.
Well, then there you go.

01:51.929 --> 01:53.096
- You've what?
- No, Artie.

01:53.131 --> 01:54.831
Shh, no, I'm--
I'm resting my case.

01:54.866 --> 01:58.301
We see no need for punishment
at this juncture.

01:58.336 --> 02:00.203
You can't be serious.

02:00.238 --> 02:04.708
Leena was a valued member
of the team and a friend.

02:04.742 --> 02:07.110
But she knew the risks
and accepted them.

02:07.145 --> 02:10.045
This is her video
signature statement.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.251
We thought seeing it
might give you some closure.

02:14.285 --> 02:18.421
Her death was a tragic,
yet unavoidable casualty

02:18.456 --> 02:20.323
in our ongoing mission.

02:20.358 --> 02:22.559
We are reinstating you
as soon as possible.

02:22.593 --> 02:23.827
I killed her!

02:23.861 --> 02:26.730
Did you?

02:26.764 --> 02:29.900
Did Arthur Nielson kill Leena?

02:29.934 --> 02:32.836
Would you have willingly
taken her life--any life--

02:35.139 --> 02:37.440
No.

02:37.475 --> 02:42.212
But it doesn't change the fact
she died by my hand.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.315
And you will have to
live with that.

02:45.349 --> 02:48.084
I fear that sentence
is far more severe

02:48.119 --> 02:50.187
than any this tribunal
could mete out.

02:50.221 --> 02:52.822
An evil that will live with you

02:52.857 --> 02:55.525
the rest of your days.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.028
We're adjourned.

03:06.938 --> 03:11.074
Claude, what is it?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.076
They didn't say
anything about it.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.544
About what?

03:14.579 --> 03:17.914
I cast you out!

03:17.949 --> 03:20.217
Nothing.
Never mind.

03:23.521 --> 03:27.257
Artie, maybe we should talk
about what happened back there.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.793
No, we probably shouldn't.

03:33.030 --> 03:35.098
Maybe we should
just give him his space.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.266
No, no, Pete.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.635
His space is really,
really dark right now.

03:38.669 --> 03:40.704
Did you hear him?
He wanted to be punished.

03:40.738 --> 03:41.838
He is not okay, Pete.

03:41.872 --> 03:43.707
Maybe he'll never be okay.

03:43.741 --> 03:45.475
I mean, we just got him back

03:45.509 --> 03:48.745
and now he's farther away
than ever.

03:48.779 --> 03:50.680
And where is Claudia?

03:50.715 --> 03:52.282
She went back to the B&B.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.617
I don't know.

03:53.651 --> 03:57.954
Maybe she's avoiding
the Warehouse or Artie or both.

03:57.989 --> 03:59.623
I do not like
what's happening.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.325
Yeah, well,
like you've been saying, Mykes.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.160
We just need
to keep moving, okay?

04:04.195 --> 04:06.763
And I'm sure
some scary artifact thing

04:06.797 --> 04:09.566
will come up
before we can say "ping."

04:09.600 --> 04:11.968
Pick up! Pick up!

04:12.003 --> 04:13.770
It's Linus Bentley!

04:13.804 --> 04:14.904
Somebody knows!

04:14.939 --> 04:16.172
We gotta get out!
We gotta!

04:16.207 --> 04:18.408
Oh, God!

04:24.582 --> 04:26.916
Please! You don't understand.
Please!

04:26.951 --> 04:30.320
What are you--
what are you doing?

04:30.354 --> 04:32.989
What are you doing?

04:33.024 --> 04:34.758
Oh, my God.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.726
Oh, my God!
Please stop!

04:36.761 --> 04:37.727
Help me!

04:37.762 --> 04:38.728
Stop!

04:38.763 --> 04:40.764
My God! No!
Please!

04:40.798 --> 04:42.032
Please stop!

04:44.201 --> 04:45.635
Help me!
Oh, my God!

04:45.670 --> 04:48.738
Help me!

04:48.773 --> 04:51.675
Oh, God!

05:09.593 --> 05:13.930
That is about the deadest guy
I've ever seen.

05:13.964 --> 05:15.999
Did you talk to the people
who found the body?

05:16.033 --> 05:18.835
Yeah, yeah, a couple of day
hikers said they heard a scream,

05:18.869 --> 05:22.238
felt a tremor, and then
something about a blue glow.

05:22.273 --> 05:24.274
A man gets sucked
into the ground.

05:24.308 --> 05:25.642
Well, it sounds like
an artifact to me.

05:25.676 --> 05:27.577
Yeah, maybe something
quicksand-related.

05:27.611 --> 05:29.646
Promises to be
loads of fun though.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.947
How's Claudia?

05:30.981 --> 05:33.316
Eh, she's up
looking for clues.

05:34.485 --> 05:36.586
Not really the outdoorsy type.

05:36.588 --> 05:39.222
I think it was a good idea
for her to come with me.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.957
It'll keep her mind off Artie.

05:40.991 --> 05:42.225
How's he doing?

05:42.259 --> 05:44.227
Well, he's been
in the stacks all morning.

05:44.261 --> 05:48.298
Steve and I are gonna go
look for him in a bit.

05:48.332 --> 05:49.966
Oh, an ATV!

05:50.000 --> 05:51.668
Oh, man I love ATVs.

05:51.702 --> 05:53.069
Hey, Mykes,
you think the Warehouse

05:53.104 --> 05:54.604
- could get a decked out--
- No.

05:54.638 --> 05:57.607
Hello?

05:57.641 --> 05:59.275
- Hi there.
- Hey.

05:59.310 --> 06:01.378
Special Agent Pete Lattimer,
Secret Service.

06:01.412 --> 06:02.712
Whoa.

06:02.747 --> 06:04.180
- No. Secret Service?
- Yeah.

06:04.215 --> 06:05.315
That is very cool.

06:05.349 --> 06:06.750
I'm Ranger Evan Smith.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.118
Ranger Smith?

06:09.553 --> 06:13.289
"Hey, Mr. Ranger, sir."

06:14.692 --> 06:16.226
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.827
Man, you probably get that
all the time.

06:17.862 --> 06:19.329
"Hey, Boo-Boo."

06:19.363 --> 06:21.598
- Nope, can't say that I do.
- What?

06:21.632 --> 06:23.400
- No.
- No? The--the cartoon?

06:23.434 --> 06:25.201
- Listen, uh...
- Right.

06:25.236 --> 06:26.836
People are freaking out
about this.

06:26.871 --> 06:29.939
Seismic activity
doesn't usually limit itself

06:29.974 --> 06:31.775
to a few square yards,
you know what I mean?

06:31.809 --> 06:32.942
Mm-hmm.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.010
How does something
like this even happen?

06:34.044 --> 06:36.379
Well, you'd be surprised

06:36.414 --> 06:38.148
at the kind of things
that could happen.

06:38.182 --> 06:39.249
"Go with Pete," they said.

06:39.283 --> 06:41.418
"You'll love it.
Sunshine and fresh air."

06:41.452 --> 06:42.419
Ow!

06:42.453 --> 06:45.722
Why am I so delicious to you?

06:52.329 --> 06:57.967
I've sat on too many laptops
not to know that sound.

06:58.002 --> 07:00.570
Hey.

07:00.604 --> 07:01.671
What did you find?

07:01.705 --> 07:03.406
I think--yep.

07:03.441 --> 07:04.707
Buried cell phone.

07:04.742 --> 07:05.775
Coincidence?

07:05.810 --> 07:07.243
Hardly ever.
Can you hack it?

07:07.278 --> 07:09.679
- I think--
- Oh.

07:09.713 --> 07:12.115
Might take me a little bit.

07:12.149 --> 07:14.984
Well, Bentley could have
dropped it on his way down.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.152
Who?

07:16.187 --> 07:17.687
Linus Bentley, our victim.

07:17.721 --> 07:20.290
He's the president
of Qualcascommunications.

07:20.324 --> 07:24.394
I got his wallet and his cards,
but no artifact on him.

07:24.428 --> 07:26.062
Which might mean somebody else
did the whammying?

07:26.096 --> 07:29.165
Let's find out who would
want this guy dead, huh?

07:29.200 --> 07:31.401
All right,
scanning for info now.

07:31.435 --> 07:34.237
Ugh, my connection sucks
out here.

07:34.271 --> 07:36.039
You know we're in the middle
of a forest, right?

07:36.073 --> 07:37.407
Ow!

07:37.441 --> 07:39.242
Stop that.
Well aware.

07:39.276 --> 07:41.377
I'll kill your whole family.

07:43.914 --> 07:45.381
Okay.
Linus Bentley, telecom guru.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.851
His name's all over
the Oregon blogosphere.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.953
Apparently a substation
Qualcast is building

07:49.987 --> 07:53.456
is drawing the wrath of
Green First, a local nonprofit,

07:53.491 --> 07:55.658
claiming that the signals
are disturbing

07:55.693 --> 07:57.760
a local owl sanctuary,
probably killing bees.

07:57.795 --> 08:00.663
Oh, they've been trying
to get construction shut down.

08:00.698 --> 08:01.764
Bentley's a good place
to start

08:01.799 --> 08:03.700
if green first wanted this
project buried.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.735
- All right, you guys ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.337
All right, up.
Come on.

08:07.371 --> 08:10.106
Bad choice of words.

08:10.140 --> 08:13.443
It's just that he's in
a really scary place right now

08:13.477 --> 08:15.979
and I just--I hate
to think about him wandering

08:16.013 --> 08:18.381
by himself down here
in crazy town.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.783
You don't think
that he would do anything?

08:20.818 --> 08:22.752
I--I don't--

08:22.786 --> 08:24.521
- Oh, my God! Artie!
- Artie! Don't!

08:24.555 --> 08:25.855
Aah!

08:25.890 --> 08:27.624
Ow! Ah!

08:27.658 --> 08:30.059
What is wrong with you?

08:30.094 --> 08:31.828
Us?

08:31.862 --> 08:35.265
You with the--the--the blade!
No?

08:35.299 --> 08:36.832
"No" what?

08:36.866 --> 08:38.268
I was redistributing its
energy weight.

08:38.302 --> 08:39.869
Has to be done every 90 days.

08:39.904 --> 08:41.136
What are you doing here anyway?

08:41.171 --> 08:43.106
I thought you were on a ping
with Pete in Oregon.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.941
I sent Claudia with Pete.

08:44.975 --> 08:47.043
- <i>You</i> sent?
- Uh-huh.

08:47.077 --> 08:49.412
Since when do you--

08:49.446 --> 08:50.446
You know what?
It's fine.

08:50.481 --> 08:52.549
It's fine with me.
Whatever.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.150
No, Artie,
yell at me, please.

08:54.184 --> 08:55.718
- I said it was fine.
- No!

08:55.753 --> 08:57.954
I should have consulted you.
I should have--

08:57.988 --> 08:59.656
Myka, stop.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.457
What's this?

09:01.492 --> 09:03.259
It's nothing.
Give it--give that to me.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.762
What is this?

09:05.796 --> 09:07.263
"Leena's list"?

09:07.298 --> 09:10.967
Yes, it's, uh, things that...

09:11.001 --> 09:13.303
she did to keep
certain artifacts in balance.

09:13.337 --> 09:15.104
Somebody--somebody has to
keep doing it.

09:15.139 --> 09:16.806
Anyway.
Doesn't matter.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.074
Just leave it.
Leave me alone.

09:18.108 --> 09:20.443
Artie, let us help you.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.712
- Yeah.
- Help me?

09:22.746 --> 09:24.948
I've been doing this job alone
for 35 years.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.282
- Thank you very much.
- You know what?

09:26.317 --> 09:27.517
Fine, Artie.

09:27.551 --> 09:28.818
You just go do everything
by yourself,

09:28.852 --> 09:30.520
and we'll just follow you around
and watch you.

09:30.554 --> 09:33.356
Fine.
Good luck with that.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.525
Clean up that mess you made!

09:38.596 --> 09:41.164
Ah, so this is
an environmental nonprofit, huh?

09:41.198 --> 09:42.765
Yeah, what'd you expect?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.100
I don't know.

09:44.134 --> 09:46.836
Hippies in tie-dye singing
<i>Age Of Aquarius.</i>

09:46.870 --> 09:48.671
You know Vietnam's over,
right?

09:48.706 --> 09:50.273
For those of us
who've watched

09:50.307 --> 09:53.643
the director's cut of <i>Platoon,</i>
it'll never be over.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.244
Okay, great.

09:55.279 --> 09:57.947
Start with the block
of spaulding

09:57.982 --> 09:59.315
near the community gardens.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.884
We only need
another 65 signatures.

10:01.919 --> 10:03.519
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:03.554 --> 10:04.988
You look like you might be
in charge.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.889
Hi. Yes.

10:06.924 --> 10:09.392
Welcome to Green First.
I'm Autumn Radnor.

10:09.426 --> 10:10.927
Thank you for coming.

10:10.961 --> 10:12.662
Oh, it's great to see
people coming out

10:12.696 --> 10:14.130
to help with their dads.

10:14.164 --> 10:17.233
Ahh, that's what it feels like
to be shot.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.835
We just moved
into the storefront,

10:18.869 --> 10:20.236
so it's a little hectic
around here,

10:20.270 --> 10:23.139
but I know they could really
use some help in the phone bank.

10:23.173 --> 10:27.410
Uh, no, me and my non-related-
work-partner-colleague-

10:27.444 --> 10:30.747
who's-really-not-young-enough-
to-be-my-daughter person and I

10:30.781 --> 10:33.716
have some questions
about Linus Bentley.

10:33.751 --> 10:36.552
Seriously?

10:36.587 --> 10:38.888
He's using the government
to intimidate us now?

10:38.922 --> 10:40.523
That is pretty desperate.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.659
You can tell him
we're not backing down.

10:42.693 --> 10:44.227
We're not here
about the birds.

10:44.261 --> 10:45.395
- Owls.
- Owls are birds.

10:45.429 --> 10:47.530
It's not just about the owls.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.065
It's about greed.

10:49.099 --> 10:52.602
"We do not ride the railroad,
it rides upon us."

10:52.636 --> 10:54.170
Ding!

10:54.204 --> 10:56.039
Who is Henry David Thoreau?

10:56.073 --> 10:58.241
Six years of college, so...

10:58.275 --> 11:00.743
If we don't stop them here,
it's only a matter of time

11:00.778 --> 11:03.246
before we lose the forest
completely.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.347
Look, you can tell him--

11:04.381 --> 11:05.648
Look, <i>Ferngully,</i>

11:05.683 --> 11:07.083
we understand
that you're pissed, okay?

11:07.117 --> 11:08.451
But Bentley didn't send us.

11:08.485 --> 11:10.586
Actually, he's--
he's dead.

11:10.621 --> 11:14.057
Linus is--

11:14.091 --> 11:16.025
he's--he's dead?

11:16.060 --> 11:17.593
Oh, my God.

11:17.628 --> 11:21.030
He was killed
in the Cowan National Forest...

11:21.065 --> 11:23.566
ironically.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.469
Excuse me, I...
have to make a call.

11:26.503 --> 11:32.108
Um, Becky will answer
any of your questions.

11:34.645 --> 11:35.945
So Bentley was
in the woods yesterday

11:35.979 --> 11:38.181
because he was scouting
locations for cell towers.

11:38.215 --> 11:39.916
Well, that makes sense,
but she doesn't.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.451
I mean, first thing,
he's the devil.

11:41.485 --> 11:43.753
Next thing you know,
she's crying over his death.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.122
I don't know if that's
suspicious or just another facet

11:46.156 --> 11:47.557
of women I'll never understand.

11:47.591 --> 11:49.092
Is there anything
about women you understand?

11:49.126 --> 11:50.393
Booby region.

11:50.427 --> 11:52.562
Oh.

11:52.596 --> 11:54.497
Bingo.

11:54.531 --> 11:55.898
I cloned his SIM card.

11:55.933 --> 11:57.834
It was damaged, but I managed
to get a few numbers.

11:57.868 --> 12:00.103
- Anything good?
- Couple of calls to the office,

12:00.137 --> 12:02.972
and the last one to a different
number yesterday afternoon.

12:03.006 --> 12:04.941
A place called

12:04.975 --> 12:07.243
"Fine Young Cannabis
Organic Healing."

12:07.277 --> 12:09.679
It's just that Bentley didn't
seem like the kind of guy

12:09.713 --> 12:12.148
that'd be into
medical marijuana.

12:12.182 --> 12:14.650
Oh, this place smells like
my guitar teacher.

12:14.685 --> 12:17.353
Geoff Nevins?
Mr. Nevins?

12:17.387 --> 12:19.856
Hello?
Is anybody here?

12:19.890 --> 12:21.891
We're not cops.

12:21.925 --> 12:23.893
You know just about every cop
who comes in here

12:23.927 --> 12:25.194
probably says that.

12:25.229 --> 12:26.629
Good point.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.532
Okay!
We're the cops!

12:32.569 --> 12:34.637
Claude.

12:38.942 --> 12:40.643
Pick up, Geoff!
Pick up!

12:40.677 --> 12:43.045
It's Linus Bentley!
Somebody knows!

12:43.080 --> 12:44.647
We gotta get out!
We gotta--

12:44.681 --> 12:46.816
Oh, God!

12:46.850 --> 12:48.251
Blue glow.

12:48.285 --> 12:51.454
Wanna take a wild guess
why he never got that message?

13:00.097 --> 13:02.298
Holy ganja, Batman.

13:02.332 --> 13:05.501
Ah, well, the blue glow
is from the grow lights.

13:07.938 --> 13:09.972
- Uh, Pete?
- Yeah?

13:10.007 --> 13:12.241
Look at this.

13:12.276 --> 13:14.510
Isn't that the same symbol

13:14.545 --> 13:16.179
that was carved into the tree
in the woods?

13:16.213 --> 13:18.548
Yes, it is.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.992
Looks like Geoff Nevins
is taking a dirt nap.

13:37.492 --> 13:39.359
Hey, I got the Warehouse
system looking for anything

13:39.394 --> 13:40.561
that moves dirt.

13:40.595 --> 13:41.795
So far, no luck.

13:41.830 --> 13:43.964
This symbol,
I've seen it before.

13:43.998 --> 13:45.866
Yeah, back in the woods,
but--

13:45.900 --> 13:48.802
Somewhere else.
May I?

13:50.238 --> 13:51.905
What are you doing?

13:51.940 --> 13:53.340
Tippy-tappy is my thing.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.709
Uh, Secret Service Database,
so...

13:55.743 --> 13:58.178
Ah.

14:01.749 --> 14:02.950
I forgot my password.

14:02.984 --> 14:05.819
May I?

14:10.458 --> 14:11.725
Really?

14:11.759 --> 14:13.060
"Peterulz23"?

14:13.094 --> 14:14.695
All right.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.230
Yeah, I remember thinking
it was weird

14:16.264 --> 14:18.899
when "Peterulz" 1 through 22
were taken.

14:18.933 --> 14:22.302
And... bazinga.

14:22.337 --> 14:24.204
See?
I know things.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.807
Wow. Okay.
Details?

14:26.841 --> 14:29.476
About ten years ago,
there was a psycho group

14:29.511 --> 14:31.044
of tree-huggers
from the northwest.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.813
They called themselves
The Last People On Earth.

14:32.847 --> 14:34.248
This calls them
eco-terrorists.

14:34.282 --> 14:35.983
That's the psycho part.

14:36.017 --> 14:39.153
Anything with "terror" in it
comes up on our radar.

14:39.187 --> 14:41.555
These guys did some
pretty gnarly vandalism

14:41.589 --> 14:43.090
at some logging sites
in Oregon.

14:43.124 --> 14:44.892
Wow, these guys were hardcore.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.460
Used the Cowan Forest
as their cover,

14:46.494 --> 14:48.729
hit dozens of construction
sites over two years.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.030
<i>The Lorax</i> meets
<i>Red Dawn.</i>

14:50.064 --> 14:52.499
Says here they dropped off
the map ten years ago.

14:52.534 --> 14:54.234
So why are they back now?
I don't know.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.036
Maybe they got their
green thumbs on an artifact.

14:56.070 --> 14:57.671
Instead of just burning down
equipment, now they're--

14:57.705 --> 14:58.805
They're going right
to the source.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.840
They're killing anyone

14:59.874 --> 15:01.041
they think is harming
the environment.

15:01.075 --> 15:02.409
Linus Bentley was gonna tear up
the forest

15:02.443 --> 15:03.544
for cell phone towers.

15:03.578 --> 15:04.811
All right, well,
how do we find

15:04.846 --> 15:06.079
these Last People On Earth?

15:06.114 --> 15:08.048
Okay, most of the members
stayed anonymous.

15:08.082 --> 15:09.516
Only one they caught
was Ryan Clayton,

15:09.551 --> 15:10.984
and he died in prison
a year ago.

15:11.019 --> 15:13.921
Maybe they're back
at their old digs?

15:13.955 --> 15:16.523
The FBI trace them to an
abandoned cabin in Cowan Forest.

15:16.558 --> 15:18.225
Oh, and I know just the...

15:18.259 --> 15:19.726
Mr. Ranger sir

15:19.761 --> 15:21.895
to lead Yogi and Boo-Boo
directly

15:21.930 --> 15:24.064
to a pic-a-nic central.

15:24.098 --> 15:25.199
Roo-roo.

15:41.749 --> 15:42.916
I've never been
in here before.

15:45.420 --> 15:46.787
Artie, what is this?

15:46.821 --> 15:49.356
It's where she wor--

15:49.390 --> 15:52.326
It's where Leena worked.

15:54.229 --> 15:55.696
It's very peaceful.

15:55.730 --> 16:00.500
Yes, it is.

16:00.535 --> 16:01.668
What is this circle?

16:01.703 --> 16:03.770
It's a feng shui spiral

16:03.805 --> 16:05.272
that originated
in Warehouse Six.

16:05.306 --> 16:08.008
It reads our
more difficult artifacts.

16:08.042 --> 16:10.210
Determines
the overpowering emotion

16:10.245 --> 16:11.878
behind their creation.

16:11.913 --> 16:13.313
So we can shelve them
properly.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.616
Yes, it's how Leena
interpreted

16:15.650 --> 16:17.684
an artifact's energy.

16:17.719 --> 16:20.554
Where's the porthole from?

16:20.588 --> 16:23.156
Oh, that's, uh--that's from the
airship <i>Norge,</i> right?

16:23.191 --> 16:26.059
It was the first dirigible
to cross the North Pole.

16:26.094 --> 16:28.729
Pete and I snagged that,
what, Artie, two years ago?

16:28.763 --> 16:31.098
Yes, it's been in the Ovoid
Quarantine ever since.

16:31.132 --> 16:34.468
It's time we gave it a home.

17:02.030 --> 17:03.930
I think you should buy
a vowel.

17:03.965 --> 17:05.598
- I would imagine...
- It means "great sorrow."

17:05.633 --> 17:07.534
Thank you.

17:07.568 --> 17:12.172
Uh...

17:12.205 --> 17:17.243
All right, aisle...
Toledo 81-K.

17:17.278 --> 17:19.146
Satisfied I'm not gonna
beat myself to death

17:19.180 --> 17:20.981
with this porthole?

17:21.015 --> 17:23.983
Fine.
Good-bye now.

17:24.018 --> 17:27.020
I don't think our presence
is having the desired effect.

17:27.055 --> 17:29.556
So this is the place?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.725
It's nothing but
a burned-out shack now.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.461
What happened?
A forest fire?

17:34.495 --> 17:37.664
Well, the story I heard was
that the FBI got a lead

17:37.699 --> 17:39.066
on one of those
last earth guys,

17:39.100 --> 17:41.034
they chased him up here,
and set fire to the place

17:41.069 --> 17:43.103
before he got arrested.

17:43.137 --> 17:46.940
Uh, listen, if you guys
can find your own way back...

17:46.974 --> 17:50.210
I gotta go deal with a drum
circle in the picnic meadow.

17:50.244 --> 17:53.747
Ooh, well, I got some tear gas
in the car if you wanna...

17:59.821 --> 18:02.789
I'm joking, 'cause it's just
a drum circle, so...

18:02.824 --> 18:05.592
So... why would Ryan Clayton
burn down

18:05.626 --> 18:07.627
his own group's base?

18:07.662 --> 18:09.529
Uh, force of habit?

18:09.564 --> 18:12.165
His favorite thing
is burning things down.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.568
Oh, wow.
That's beautiful.

18:14.602 --> 18:16.470
Yeah, shoulda focused more
on the art

18:16.504 --> 18:17.704
and less on the arson.

18:17.739 --> 18:20.340
You know, if the LPE
are back in action,

18:20.375 --> 18:23.610
I don't think they're working
from here.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.279
Hey, Claude,
check this out.

18:30.918 --> 18:34.621
"In wildness is
the preservation of the world."

18:34.655 --> 18:38.291
Yeah, it's the lyrics
to an awesome Metallica song,

18:38.326 --> 18:40.327
but it's also
a Henry David Thoreau quote.

18:40.361 --> 18:43.096
Now, who do we know
that's protesting Bentley

18:43.131 --> 18:44.598
that's against
medical marijuana farming

18:44.632 --> 18:45.966
and likes to quote HDT?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.235
You think Autumn is one
of The Last People On Earth?

18:48.269 --> 18:50.170
Well, collecting petitions
is nice,

18:50.204 --> 18:51.705
but nothing says
"Stop raping the forest"

18:51.739 --> 18:54.408
like an artifact.

19:09.891 --> 19:12.592
She pulls out the artifact,
stay away from dirt.

19:12.627 --> 19:14.428
That's my everyday
philosophy.

19:24.739 --> 19:27.340
Looks like she was making
a break for it.

19:31.412 --> 19:34.848
Think she got out the window?

19:34.882 --> 19:37.918
Yeah, yeah, she, uh...

19:37.952 --> 19:39.586
She's probably long gone by now.
We'll never catch her.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.021
We might as well go back...

19:41.055 --> 19:42.022
- to the hotel!
- Get away from me!

19:42.056 --> 19:43.490
Aah!

19:45.960 --> 19:48.161
Aah! Ugh! God!

19:48.196 --> 19:50.363
Peppers... so good in burritos,
so bad in the eyes.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.199
- Pete, watch it.
- Oh, thanks.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.134
- Where's the artifact?
- The what?

19:54.168 --> 19:55.535
Whatever you used
to bury Bentley and Nevins.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.003
You think I killed them?

19:57.038 --> 19:58.805
Well, the whole packing
and fleeing thing

19:58.840 --> 20:00.073
is kind of a dead giveaway.

20:00.107 --> 20:02.042
We know you were part
of The Last People On Earth

20:02.076 --> 20:04.211
and now you're picking off
mother nature's enemies.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.179
- No, they were my friends.
- What? Your friends?

20:06.214 --> 20:09.749
Yes, I was a member,
but so was Linus, so was Geoff.

20:09.784 --> 20:11.084
What?
They were all LPE?

20:11.118 --> 20:12.419
Yes, we all were.

20:12.453 --> 20:14.855
And now someone knows
who we are,

20:14.889 --> 20:19.392
what we did, and they're
killing us one by one.

20:23.223 --> 20:26.543
I probably shouldn't have
held on to this,

20:26.825 --> 20:28.323
but I just couldn't
help myself.

20:28.348 --> 20:29.708
Oh, is that you?

20:29.747 --> 20:32.782
And, uh, there's Linus
and Geoff.

20:36.053 --> 20:37.487
What about these two?

20:37.521 --> 20:38.888
That's Annie.

20:38.923 --> 20:40.890
She died of cancer
two years back.

20:40.925 --> 20:43.960
- And that's Ryan.
- Oh, yeah.

20:43.994 --> 20:45.862
The guy who took the rap
and died in prison.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.364
The FBI ID'd him.

20:48.399 --> 20:50.433
Hunted him up to the cabin.

20:50.468 --> 20:52.669
He burned it down to keep them
from finding any evidence

20:52.703 --> 20:54.504
linking the rest
of us to the LPE.

20:54.538 --> 20:56.139
So how'd the group
get started?

20:56.173 --> 20:57.440
We met in college.

20:57.475 --> 21:00.176
Found out we all had
the same concerns and interests.

21:00.211 --> 21:02.512
Like vandalism, pyromania?

21:02.546 --> 21:06.015
Like protecting the Cowan
Forest from Lockhart Logging.

21:06.050 --> 21:09.119
They were tearing it apart
and we had to stop them

21:09.153 --> 21:10.386
before there was
nothing left.

21:10.421 --> 21:12.422
By blowing up
their equipment?

21:12.456 --> 21:17.160
We were young
and idealistic... and stupid.

21:17.194 --> 21:19.796
It wasn't like that
at the start,

21:19.830 --> 21:21.598
but things started
getting crazy.

21:21.632 --> 21:25.068
We were hitting bigger targets,
causing more damage,

21:25.102 --> 21:27.904
and then...
someone got hurt.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.072
It scared us.

21:29.106 --> 21:32.542
So you all just walked away?

21:32.576 --> 21:35.211
Are you gonna arrest me?

21:35.246 --> 21:36.246
It's not really our thing.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.381
Lockhart Logging.

21:38.415 --> 21:39.749
I mean, if anyone wanted
you guys dead

21:39.783 --> 21:40.850
after all this time--

21:40.885 --> 21:44.254
Haddon Lockhart
runs the company.

21:44.288 --> 21:46.856
He really,
really didn't like us.

21:46.891 --> 21:48.858
To be fair, you blew up
a lot of his stuff.

21:48.893 --> 21:50.627
Worse.

21:50.661 --> 21:52.262
We never wanted
to hurt anyone,

21:52.296 --> 21:54.664
and we thought the logging site
was empty for the night,

21:54.698 --> 21:56.699
but Lockhart was there.

21:56.734 --> 21:59.102
He was the one who was hurt
in the explosion.

21:59.136 --> 22:01.070
So if anyone has a reason
to want you dead--

22:01.105 --> 22:02.705
Where is Lockhart these days?

22:02.740 --> 22:04.073
Still running the company.

22:04.108 --> 22:05.975
Okay, look,
I'm gonna go talk to him.

22:06.010 --> 22:07.544
Claude, stay with Autumn, okay?

22:07.578 --> 22:08.811
Make sure he doesn't
get to her.

22:08.846 --> 22:12.148
You got it.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.848
Artie, so...

22:45.883 --> 22:49.986
You're not gonna watch it?

22:50.020 --> 22:52.121
Won't change anything.
Won't bring her back.

22:55.593 --> 22:58.928
You know, I remember when
I made my signature statement.

22:58.963 --> 23:01.598
Saying it out loud,
talking about the risks

23:01.632 --> 23:05.635
and the dangers,
it was so scary.

23:05.669 --> 23:07.704
But it...

23:07.738 --> 23:11.674
It kind of makes you realize
how important this is, you know?

23:11.709 --> 23:17.113
She didn't understand.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.782
She did not agree to this.

23:19.817 --> 23:23.453
Yes, she did.

23:23.487 --> 23:25.321
We all did.

23:25.356 --> 23:26.956
You should watch it.

23:32.563 --> 23:34.163
Wait.
Isn't--isn't that where--

23:34.198 --> 23:37.066
That is where we shelved
the <i>Norge</i> Porthole.

23:37.101 --> 23:38.868
This is bad.
We have to go.

23:38.902 --> 23:41.971
Secret Service?
What's this about?

23:42.006 --> 23:44.207
Do you remember a group called
The Last People On Earth?

23:46.277 --> 23:47.977
You damn right I do.

23:48.012 --> 23:50.747
Those crazy bunch
of maniacs...

23:50.781 --> 23:53.316
nearly killed me.

23:53.350 --> 23:55.685
They firebombed
my construction yard.

23:55.719 --> 23:57.353
Maybe they didn't know
you were there.

23:57.388 --> 23:59.389
They're a bunch of psychos.

23:59.423 --> 24:01.491
If I ever find out
who the rest of them were--

24:01.525 --> 24:03.559
You'd what?
Bury 'em alive?

24:03.594 --> 24:05.061
That'd be too good for them.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.196
It took years--years--

24:07.231 --> 24:09.132
to get that camp
up and running again.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.435
Hundreds of lost jobs,
millions in lost revenue.

24:12.469 --> 24:14.270
I thought they'd all
be in jail by now.

24:14.305 --> 24:16.906
How did the FBI get a lead
on Ryan Clayton?

24:16.940 --> 24:18.341
That was an anonymous tip.

24:18.375 --> 24:21.210
And he refused to identify
his cohorts.

24:21.245 --> 24:23.212
You see this?

24:23.247 --> 24:25.948
This was the happiest day
of my life.

24:25.983 --> 24:29.519
The day I stood up and testified
against that terrorist.

24:29.553 --> 24:32.021
All of his family were there,
all of them in shock.

24:32.056 --> 24:33.723
But you know what?

24:33.757 --> 24:36.693
You raise a monster,
that's what happens.

24:44.068 --> 24:46.869
Oh, my God.

24:46.904 --> 24:50.973
I haven't seen this
in a long time.

24:51.008 --> 24:54.977
2002 Sasquatch Festival.

24:55.012 --> 24:57.380
I drove all night for that.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.849
Ryan didn't want to go,
but I dragged him for backup

24:59.883 --> 25:01.384
while I stalked Adam Duritz.

25:01.418 --> 25:02.919
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.

25:02.953 --> 25:04.887
Oh, my God.
Why would you do that?

25:04.922 --> 25:07.056
Because I had a real thing
for dreadlocks.

25:07.091 --> 25:08.358
- Eww!
- I know.

25:08.392 --> 25:10.093
They were terrible ones too.

25:10.127 --> 25:11.894
It wasn't pretty.

25:11.929 --> 25:14.931
So, uh...

25:14.965 --> 25:18.201
Do you ever have any regrets
about the whole

25:18.235 --> 25:22.839
you-were-by-definition-
a-terrorist thing?

25:22.873 --> 25:25.775
We made some bad decisions.

25:25.809 --> 25:27.710
Really bad ones.

25:27.745 --> 25:30.546
But we did good things too.

25:30.581 --> 25:34.150
The LPE was the first time I
felt like something

25:34.184 --> 25:36.686
I was doing mattered.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.921
I never gave much thought
to tomorrow.

25:41.425 --> 25:43.659
I, uh--man.

25:43.694 --> 25:46.028
I think about tomorrow
all the time right now.

25:46.063 --> 25:48.064
Why's that?

25:48.098 --> 25:51.434
Uh, well...

25:51.468 --> 25:57.140
Couple of weeks ago,
I got into a fight, um...

25:57.174 --> 25:59.275
with someone at work--
my boss--

25:59.309 --> 26:04.213
and I had to
do something that...

26:04.248 --> 26:05.882
I thought could help him,

26:05.916 --> 26:09.752
but also
could possibly kill him.

26:09.787 --> 26:12.321
That last part doesn't sound
like a metaphor.

26:12.356 --> 26:14.123
Long story.

26:14.158 --> 26:17.493
Didn't actually kill him,
by the way.

26:17.528 --> 26:19.796
I just--

26:19.830 --> 26:21.798
Now I don't know
what to do about it with him.

26:21.832 --> 26:25.501
Oh, Claudia, when I was
your age, I was a mess.

26:25.536 --> 26:28.438
Maybe everyone's a mess
in their 20s.

26:28.472 --> 26:30.673
And you don't get
any do-overs.

26:30.707 --> 26:36.078
You just get older
and figure things out as you go.

26:39.416 --> 26:41.417
Shh.

26:49.526 --> 26:52.028
Stop right there.

26:52.062 --> 26:53.529
Hello, Autumn.

26:53.564 --> 26:55.031
Evan?

26:55.065 --> 26:56.599
That's Ranger Smith.
What?

26:56.633 --> 26:59.202
No, that's Evan.
Ryan's brother Evan.

26:59.236 --> 27:01.237
Well, I had to
change my name.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.206
It's pretty tough to get
a government job

27:03.240 --> 27:05.341
when you're related
to a convicted terrorist.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.677
That's what's doing it.
That--dude, that lantern--

27:07.711 --> 27:09.345
- You wanna see what it does?
- No, no, I'm good.

27:15.219 --> 27:16.886
Claudia!
Aah!

27:16.920 --> 27:19.155
Stop!

27:19.189 --> 27:20.590
Evan, you killed the others?

27:20.624 --> 27:21.824
One of you betrayed Ryan

27:21.859 --> 27:23.626
and turned him in to Lockhart
and his goons.

27:23.660 --> 27:25.394
You don't know what happened!
What Ryan--

27:25.429 --> 27:26.729
No, stop! Just stop!

27:26.763 --> 27:28.164
You're the worst of the bunch.

27:28.198 --> 27:30.366
I was just a kid when you sent
my brother to prison.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.201
Now I'm gonna
get justice for him.

27:32.236 --> 27:34.136
Freeze!

27:34.171 --> 27:37.373
Oh, great.
Yogi's here.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.308
Drop that lantern.

27:39.343 --> 27:42.578
You drop first.

27:44.047 --> 27:46.516
Sleep tight.

27:46.550 --> 27:48.050
Get in.

27:48.085 --> 27:50.853
Oh! Oh!

27:50.888 --> 27:53.489
No! No!

27:58.879 --> 28:01.381
Ah, no. No.

28:01.622 --> 28:04.358
No, no, no, no!

28:04.393 --> 28:07.094
Damn it!

28:11.967 --> 28:14.268
Oh, my God. Pete!

28:14.303 --> 28:15.869
Oh, my God.

28:15.905 --> 28:17.504
Pete! - Aah!

28:24.045 --> 28:25.011
Are you okay?

28:25.047 --> 28:27.814
I got dirt in places...

28:27.850 --> 28:31.018
where dirt should never be, but
otherwise, yeah, I'm fine.

28:31.051 --> 28:32.520
Listen, Evan Smith
is actually...

28:33.333 --> 28:34.866
Evan Clayton.

28:34.902 --> 28:37.124
I saw the picture in
Lockhart's office.

28:37.168 --> 28:39.635
He's no Ranger
Smith and he lied!

28:39.670 --> 28:41.937
He knows who Yogi Bear is.
He's a liar!

28:41.970 --> 28:43.504
He took Autumn!
I don't know where he went.

28:43.541 --> 28:45.407
Kept her alive for a reason.

28:45.442 --> 28:46.909
We gotta find out why.

28:46.944 --> 28:49.211
Come on, Claude. Let's go.

28:51.315 --> 28:54.016
Jeez. What is happening?

28:54.049 --> 28:55.550
I was in Ovoid when
I heard the alarm.

28:55.584 --> 28:57.351
Artifacts must have done
this by themselves.

28:57.388 --> 28:59.922
All right.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.923
- What the hell is that?
- It's a goo-nade.

29:01.957 --> 29:02.990
Claudia made it.

29:03.025 --> 29:04.292
She has to put her
name on everything.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.726
Well, should we take cover?

29:05.763 --> 29:08.530
Or you could just throw it
and we'll see what happens.

29:18.107 --> 29:20.676
Uh...

29:20.709 --> 29:22.677
Started here at the
Norge Porthole.

29:22.713 --> 29:25.113
Artie!

29:25.149 --> 29:27.482
This crate has busted
open from the inside.

29:27.518 --> 29:29.384
It says "Da Vinci's gargoyle"?

29:29.420 --> 29:31.854
I don't like the
sound of that.

29:33.424 --> 29:35.991
Actually, that sound--
that's the one I don't like.

29:36.026 --> 29:38.861
Everybody get down!

29:53.743 --> 29:56.712
Damn it.
He took Autumn someplace else.

30:01.184 --> 30:02.884
So how did he figure out
who the other members were

30:02.920 --> 30:06.588
if Ryan never talked?

30:06.622 --> 30:08.489
Claude, I think this might
be Ryan's old journal.

30:08.523 --> 30:09.523
Listen to this:

30:09.560 --> 30:11.193
"Successful strike
with September

30:11.226 --> 30:12.326
"and Purple Haze today.

30:12.363 --> 30:14.062
Lockhart out of
commission soon."

30:14.098 --> 30:15.297
Code names.

30:15.330 --> 30:16.430
In case the journal
was discovered,

30:16.465 --> 30:17.765
he wanted to protect
their identities.

30:17.801 --> 30:19.801
Obviously, Geoff
Nevins is Purple Haze,

30:19.837 --> 30:22.537
and September is the
first month in autumn.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.005
So Evan must have
found that journal

30:24.039 --> 30:25.306
after his brother
died and figured out

30:25.340 --> 30:26.908
who the other members
were that way.

30:26.942 --> 30:28.776
He must think they
sold his brother out.

30:28.810 --> 30:30.244
How much damage can he
do with that thing?

30:30.281 --> 30:32.547
I don't know, but
I bet I know where.

30:32.583 --> 30:36.218
Does Lockhart's main logging
camp seem like a sure bet?

30:36.251 --> 30:37.885
If he's going after the
people who wronged his brother.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.420
Lockhart's at the
top of that list,

30:39.454 --> 30:40.821
and I doubt Evan cares
how many people

30:40.858 --> 30:42.858
he takes out with him.

30:47.697 --> 30:49.230
Should be just a
few more miles down.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.199
Whoa!

30:57.807 --> 31:00.509
Well, whatever Evan's
planning, he wants privacy.

31:00.542 --> 31:01.742
We'll never make
it in time on foot.

31:01.779 --> 31:04.146
Do you think your Prius
can jump the chasm?

31:04.181 --> 31:05.847
Probably not.

31:05.881 --> 31:07.715
But while we're airborne,
we can check bing

31:07.751 --> 31:11.119
to see how deep the hole is
as we plummet to our deaths.

31:11.155 --> 31:13.588
Or maybe we go off-road.

31:13.624 --> 31:16.158
Yee-ha!

31:16.193 --> 31:19.594
There are no men. Only boys.

31:19.628 --> 31:20.761
You all right?

31:20.798 --> 31:23.165
I was just attacked
by a stone gargoyle.

31:23.198 --> 31:25.299
It's probably gonna be one
of my new favorite scars.

31:25.334 --> 31:27.301
- Artie, is that thing alive?
- No, no, no, no.

31:27.336 --> 31:28.502
It's a machine.

31:28.539 --> 31:30.572
It's one of Da Vinci's
lost inventions.

31:30.607 --> 31:33.108
At the end of his life,
the Italian government

31:33.141 --> 31:34.442
commissioned him
to build a device

31:34.478 --> 31:36.712
to protect the treasures
of the Milan...

31:36.747 --> 31:38.447
Cathedral!

31:38.895 --> 31:40.429
Let me guess: It
worked too well

31:40.464 --> 31:41.930
and kept everyone away.

31:41.966 --> 31:44.633
Well, it says here the agents
from warehouse Eight got lucky.

31:44.666 --> 31:46.000
It was struck with a
bolt of lightning,

31:46.034 --> 31:47.869
shutting it down long
enough to snag and bag.

31:47.903 --> 31:49.170
- Got lucky?
- Yeah.

31:49.206 --> 31:51.240
Look, uh, I left my
Tesla back in the office.

31:51.273 --> 31:53.241
- But I could keep low-- 
- Tesla? No, no, no, no, no.

31:53.275 --> 31:54.509
Tesla--no, no, no.

31:54.545 --> 31:58.544
One bolt isn't gonna be
strong enough, but--

31:59.016 --> 32:03.085
Aha!

32:03.120 --> 32:05.320
That means he has an idea.

32:05.356 --> 32:09.391
I'm not gonna evacuate my
camp because of some eco-freak.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.493
Look, this guy is dangerous.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.061
He shut down the
road to the camp.

32:13.095 --> 32:14.462
He's probably already here.

32:14.498 --> 32:17.766
And my men and I will
handle it our way.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.667
I'm not gonna hand over
this entire operation

32:19.703 --> 32:22.905
on a silver platter.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.407
No sign of him.

32:25.441 --> 32:26.474
Do we think the
lantern's strong enough

32:26.508 --> 32:27.475
to sink the whole camp?

32:28.779 --> 32:30.712
I recognize that look. Vibe?

32:30.748 --> 32:34.516
Claude... that cliff.

32:34.552 --> 32:36.518
I'll bet he's up there.

32:36.552 --> 32:38.619
A landslide from there
could bury the whole camp.

32:40.791 --> 32:41.790
Let's go!

32:44.395 --> 32:46.962
Oh, God.
I hate when I'm right.

32:52.402 --> 32:54.937
You're going to kill
all those people!

32:54.972 --> 32:58.106
Where was your
compassion for Ryan?

32:58.142 --> 33:00.309
Huh?

33:00.344 --> 33:02.678
He never gave you up. Not once.

33:02.713 --> 33:05.347
Not to me, not to
the police, no one.

33:05.382 --> 33:07.382
Could have kept him
out of prison.

33:08.414 --> 33:10.348
You know that?

33:10.383 --> 33:12.317
He died in a cage for your cause

33:12.350 --> 33:13.851
while the rest of you
got to live your lives.

33:13.887 --> 33:16.454
Evan, you can still stop this.

33:16.490 --> 33:19.958
No, Autumn...
I read his journal.

33:19.993 --> 33:21.292
He loved you.

33:21.326 --> 33:22.326
And I loved him.

33:22.362 --> 33:24.929
You're a liar!

33:24.965 --> 33:26.598
That's why I saved you for last.

33:26.633 --> 33:30.101
I wanted you to watch
the others die!

33:30.136 --> 33:33.505
After I take this place
out, they'll find you

33:33.540 --> 33:36.708
and you'll die a terrorist for
all those things you did before.

33:36.743 --> 33:39.611
Same fate that you
left for my brother!

33:42.516 --> 33:44.782
Ha! Who's smarter than
the average bear now?

33:44.818 --> 33:46.551
Autumn, grab the lantern!

33:46.584 --> 33:47.951
Hey, Claudia. Claudia, no!

33:47.988 --> 33:50.221
Claudia!

33:50.257 --> 33:52.357
That's not good.

33:57.519 --> 33:58.552
Steve, you ready?

33:58.588 --> 33:59.988
I hate this plan.

34:00.021 --> 34:01.088
Why do I have to be the bait?

34:01.124 --> 34:02.857
'Cause it already likes you.

34:02.892 --> 34:05.291
As in it's tasted my
blood and wants more.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.460
Another way of putting it.

34:15.870 --> 34:18.036
I think it sees me.

34:18.072 --> 34:21.107
Well, then go! Run!

34:21.141 --> 34:23.309
Yeah, sort of my only option.

34:24.344 --> 34:25.911
You only get one shot at this!

34:25.947 --> 34:27.580
Yeah, it relaxes me.

34:27.614 --> 34:30.983
Aah!

34:38.324 --> 34:40.659
Ah!

34:40.695 --> 34:42.395
Great.

34:42.429 --> 34:43.829
Oh, my God.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.297
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.367
Nice shot, Myka.

34:48.402 --> 34:51.170
But I still don't understand
what caused all this.

34:51.205 --> 34:53.272
Must be the porthole. Right?

34:53.304 --> 34:55.206
We must have shelved
it in the wrong place.

34:55.241 --> 34:56.808
No, no, the spiral
was very clear.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.843
Well, maybe there's something
wrong with the spiral.

35:05.787 --> 35:07.253
Wait.

35:07.288 --> 35:09.655
- What are you doing?
- Here's the plan.

35:09.688 --> 35:11.222
You're gonna lower me
down with the belt

35:11.257 --> 35:12.357
and I'm gonna grab the lantern.

35:12.391 --> 35:13.558
- Pete, no!
- Claudia--

35:13.594 --> 35:15.628
I'm lighter!

35:15.661 --> 35:16.928
Damn it.
I hate when you're right!

35:19.434 --> 35:21.400
Me too.

35:28.608 --> 35:30.910
Careful. Ah! Ah! Ah!

35:30.943 --> 35:32.377
Don't twist the belt.
It's Prada.

35:32.413 --> 35:35.047
I'll make that my priority.

35:39.419 --> 35:40.419
Careful.

35:40.455 --> 35:43.422
Get it.

35:43.458 --> 35:45.591
Get it.

35:45.626 --> 35:47.293
- You got it.
- Yeah.

35:47.328 --> 35:49.929
Bringing you up.

35:54.702 --> 35:57.870
Come here. Good job.

35:57.905 --> 35:59.905
Ah!

36:06.947 --> 36:10.216
How many times
can we try this?

36:18.625 --> 36:20.960
That's a different symbol again.

36:20.995 --> 36:24.430
It means... "misplaced anger."

36:24.465 --> 36:27.433
Five readings, five
different results.

36:27.466 --> 36:28.867
Something wrong with the spiral.

36:28.901 --> 36:30.702
Artie, this doesn't
make any sense.

36:30.738 --> 36:33.272
The Airship Norge was the first
to cross the North Pole.

36:33.307 --> 36:36.809
Anger, sorrow--those
emotions have no connection

36:36.842 --> 36:38.076
to that at all.

36:38.110 --> 36:39.511
I'm gonna put this
back in the Ovoid,

36:39.547 --> 36:43.015
let it be a problem
for Warehouse 14.

36:43.050 --> 36:46.952
Artie, what if it isn't the
spiral that's not working?

36:46.988 --> 36:50.222
What if it's...

36:50.258 --> 36:53.459
you know, perhaps...

36:53.494 --> 36:57.493
the person who's
using the spiral?

36:57.765 --> 36:59.899
Maybe?

36:59.934 --> 37:02.001
I mean, look at this place.
It's so serene.

37:02.036 --> 37:06.005
And maybe--maybe the
spiral worked for Leena

37:06.040 --> 37:09.241
because she was so
calm and centered.

37:09.277 --> 37:10.776
That makes sense.

37:10.809 --> 37:12.510
It's the only way it could
get an accurate reading.

37:12.547 --> 37:16.546
But the spiral read me.

37:16.918 --> 37:20.553
Anger, sorrow, fear.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.991
How the hell am I
supposed to do this?

37:26.027 --> 37:28.193
With us.

37:30.997 --> 37:33.399
Artie...

37:33.434 --> 37:36.302
You don't have to do
this by yourself.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.772
We can figure all of this out,
everything on Leena's list.

37:39.807 --> 37:43.576
We'll--we'll do it
together, all of us.

37:43.611 --> 37:47.413
You know, Buddha says
peace comes from within.

37:47.448 --> 37:49.515
Just might take a few lifetimes.

37:49.550 --> 37:52.217
Very comforting.

37:52.253 --> 37:53.519
Here.

37:53.554 --> 37:56.889
You might be a lifetime
or two ahead of me.

37:56.924 --> 37:58.757
I'll save you a
seat in nirvana.

38:26.486 --> 38:28.821
It says
"indescribable beauty."

38:28.856 --> 38:32.224
Well, that's--
that's more like it.

38:46.773 --> 38:49.575
Watch your head.

38:53.546 --> 38:55.614
Evan was right, you know?

38:55.650 --> 38:58.951
About Ryan.

38:58.986 --> 39:01.987
Someone did call that tip
to the FBI ten years ago.

39:04.057 --> 39:06.825
It was you.

39:06.861 --> 39:09.161
Why?

39:09.196 --> 39:13.195
Ryan... he changed.

39:14.301 --> 39:18.470
He had gotten so angry...
violent.

39:18.506 --> 39:20.539
He wanted to do
something like this.

39:20.574 --> 39:23.876
Not just hit a place, but
the people working in it.

39:23.909 --> 39:26.044
Said it was the only way we
would get their attention.

39:26.080 --> 39:30.115
I couldn't live with that,
so I did the only thing

39:30.151 --> 39:31.750
I could think of.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.553
I turned him in.

39:34.588 --> 39:37.289
I loved him and I
stuck a knife in him.

39:40.126 --> 39:43.062
You didn't have a choice.

39:43.097 --> 39:45.764
You had to stop him.

39:45.800 --> 39:50.436
You had to save him.

39:50.471 --> 39:54.470
You asked me if had any
regrets about the LPE.

39:56.110 --> 39:59.344
I should have been there for
Ryan after he got arrested.

39:59.380 --> 40:03.215
He made it clear we
should all stay away.

40:03.250 --> 40:07.249
I was young and scared,
so I did what he asked.

40:08.422 --> 40:12.421
But he needed me.

40:12.827 --> 40:16.862
He needed all of us.

40:31.911 --> 40:33.611
Oh, hi.

40:33.647 --> 40:35.293
Um...

40:35.606 --> 40:37.590
Heard you got the
snag in Oregon.

40:37.626 --> 40:40.527
That's a good-- nice job.

40:40.562 --> 40:44.097
Uh, if you're looking
for Steve or Myka,

40:44.132 --> 40:47.534
they're cleaning up
in aisle-- aisle--

40:47.569 --> 40:49.669
I did what I had to do.

40:49.705 --> 40:53.907
I know you did.

40:53.942 --> 40:55.308
That's it.

40:55.344 --> 40:57.410
Not quite.

41:00.414 --> 41:03.483
Thank you.

41:03.518 --> 41:07.454
That's it.

41:32.980 --> 41:34.413
As a Warehouse consultant,

41:34.449 --> 41:36.783
can you state, that
under no duress,

41:36.818 --> 41:40.487
you accept and understand
your responsibilities?

41:40.522 --> 41:44.090
Yes, I can. And--and I do.

41:44.126 --> 41:48.125
And you understand the
potential risks involved?

41:48.597 --> 41:51.064
Yes.

41:51.099 --> 41:55.098
The world is a dangerous place.

41:56.638 --> 42:00.206
And I know the work that
the Warehouse does,

42:00.242 --> 42:02.742
and...

42:02.778 --> 42:05.078
I just want to be
a part of that.

42:05.113 --> 42:08.114
Yes, I know that
at any given time,

42:08.150 --> 42:11.785
my life might be at risk, but...

42:11.818 --> 42:13.318
that's a risk that
I'm willing to take

42:13.355 --> 42:17.557
to make this world
a safer place.

42:17.592 --> 42:22.028
A better place.

42:23.064 --> 42:27.063
I'm sorry, Leena.

42:28.136 --> 42:31.272
I'm so sorry.
