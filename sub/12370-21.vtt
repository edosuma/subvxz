ONE THAT WILL MAKE MY FELLOW

ABOUT WHO YOU WOULD TAKE.

NEED SOMEONE TO SIT IN THE LIMO

TO PLAY FRISBEE
WITH A BUNCH OF COLLEGE BOYS

05:26.159 --> 05:29.078
AND TOTALLY EMBARRASS MYSELF.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.790

BEING OUTDOORS.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.125
RATHER LIKE GETTING
MY HANDS DIRTY.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.127
- AND I DON'T MIND
A HOSPITAL.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.421
MAYBE WE SHOULD SWITCH.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.840
- I COULD SEE THAT WORKING.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.053
- HELLO, MELANIE.

COMING ALONG?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.457
- I'M WORKING ON IT
RIGHT NOW.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.085
- YOU'RE JUST DRINKING WINE.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.796
- OH, IT JUST LOOKS THAT WAY.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.256
I'M ACTUALLY WRITING.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.093
TIME FOR A REWRITE.

FOR COMING TO MY HOME

SINCE THIS FACIAL FILLER
IS SO NEW,

06:37.605 --> 06:39.148
I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS

06:39.232 --> 06:41.984
ABOUT INJECTING MYSELF
THIS CLOSE TO THE OSCARS.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.319
- I UNDERSTAND.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.822
SO WHAT PARTS OF YOUR FACE
ARE WE TARGETING?

06:45.905 --> 06:49.075

ON MY GUINEA PIG.

NOW, SHE DOESN'T HAVE
MY NATURALLY HIGH CHEEKBONES,

06:54.038 --> 06:57.959
AND I DON'T HAVE THE DROOPING
HERE OR THE SAGGING HERE.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.336
- WELL, I COULD PLUMP HERE,

07:00.419 --> 07:03.214
ADD SOME FILLER ABOVE THE
CHEEKBONES HERE AND MAYBE HERE,

07:03.297 --> 07:04.841
AND THEN PULL--
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.009
SURPRISE ME.
JUST GO NUTS.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.011
- GO NUTS?

07:09.095 --> 07:12.265
- AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT
THOSE LINES WHEN SHE'S SCARED.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.814
- HOW LONG DO I HAVE
TO KEEP THIS ON?

07:19.897 --> 07:21.691
- YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID,
UNTIL IT SETS.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.652
YOU LOOK GREAT ALREADY.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.279
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.072
I LOOK LIKE THE ONE FRIEND

07:28.156 --> 07:29.365
WHO WOULD HAVE DONE THIS
FOR YOU.

07:29.448 --> 07:32.201
I DON'T KNOW
WHO ELSE WOULD.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.080
- VICTORIA, GUESS WHAT I DID
FOR YOU.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.999
- HOW COULD YOU?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.042
- HOW COULD <i> YOU?</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:41.919
- NOW, NOW, NO FIGHTING.

07:42.003 --> 07:45.173
YOU BOTH JUST DID SOMETHING
WONDERFUL AND IMPORTANT.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.467
GIVE EACH OTHER A HUG.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.230
- THIS IS A GREAT DRAFT, BUT
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.900
WHO IS THIS TONY
YOU HAVE ME THANKING?

08:03.983 --> 08:08.237
- YOUR THIRD CHILD.
- OH.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.448

YOU KNOW, THOSE INJECTIONS THAT
DOCTOR GAVE TO JOY AND MELANIE

08:13.993 --> 08:15.244
REALLY TURNED OUT NICELY.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.122
I'M GONNA HAVE IT DONE MYSELF.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.041
HELLO, THIS IS VICTORIA CHASE.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.922
- I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.758
- THAT BLOODY CHEEK INJECTION
MIGRATED.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.761
IT GAVE ME AN ADAM'S APPLE.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.765
I LOOK LIKE A MAN!

08:35.847 --> 08:40.061
- ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT GOES
WITH THE HANDS AND THE CHEST.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.149
- WELL, JOY,
THE DOCTOR WARNED US

08:45.233 --> 08:46.734
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COULD HAPPEN.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.070
- HE NEVER SAID <i> THIS</i>
WOULD HAPPEN!

08:49.153 --> 08:51.489
- MAYBE HE SAID THAT
ONLY TO ME.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.575
- I DISFIGURED MYSELF FOR YOU,
VICTORIA.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.743
THIS HAD BETTER COUNT
FOR SOMETHING.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.036
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

08:57.119 --> 08:57.787
NO, YOU DEFINITELY
ARE WAY AHEAD

08:57.870 --> 08:59.288

08:59.372 --> 09:01.415
- WAIT, WAIT, WHY?
I GOT THE SAME TREATMENT.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.126
- I HAVE AN ADAM'S APPLE!

09:04.210 --> 09:07.255
- AND HOW IS THAT A PLUS?

09:07.338 --> 09:10.091
WHAT WILL PEOPLE THINK
WHEN ON THE RED CARPET

09:10.174 --> 09:13.511
YOUR DATE LOOKS LIKE
JOHN STAMOS IN DRAG?

09:13.594 --> 09:17.515
- THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT, JOY.

09:17.598 --> 09:21.269
- MELANIE, I'M SORRY, BUT JOY
MADE A REAL SACRIFICE FOR ME.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.271
- WELL, I CAN DO THAT TOO.
JUST GIVE ME A TASK.

09:34.907 --> 09:39.203
- OH, NO.
IT'S FROM THE LADYPANTS PEOPLE.

09:39.287 --> 09:44.250
- "DEAR INTERNATIONAL FACE
OF INCONTINENCE...

09:47.211 --> 09:49.338
"SAY 'HI' TO ENCLOSED
ABSORBENT GOWN

09:49.422 --> 09:52.800
{\an1}THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED
TO WEAR TO THE OSCAR ACADEMIES."

09:52.883 --> 09:54.885
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.138
- I THOUGHT YOUR LAWYERS
WERE GONNA MAKE THAT GO AWAY,

09:57.221 --> 09:58.014
SO YOU COULD WEAR
THE DIOR GOWN.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.474
- SO DID I.

10:00.558 --> 10:04.186
"DESPITE BEST GOOD EFFORTS
FROM YOUR LEGAL TEAM,

10:04.270 --> 10:10.026
"OUR CONTRACT, LIKE OUR GARMENT,
IS WATERTIGHT.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.362
"HERE IS
YOUR MRS. LADYPANTS GOWN,

10:13.446 --> 10:19.035
NOW WITH
LITTER CRYSTAL TECHNOLOGY."

10:19.118 --> 10:20.244
OH, GOD.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.372
[loud crinkling]

10:26.625 --> 10:28.669
- IT'S NOT SO BAD.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.881
WITH YOUR FIGURE, YOU CAN MAKE
ANYTHING LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

10:31.964 --> 10:35.926
- AND YOU LOOK AMAZING
IN WHITE.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.721
- YOU LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.515
WEARING A DIAPER.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.518
- OH, I'M RUINED.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.396
WAIT, THERE'S A P.S.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.399
"DO NOT SPOIL SURPRISE OF GOWN.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.277
"IF IT IS SEEN IN PRESS
BEFORE OSCAR ACADEMIES,

10:53.361 --> 10:56.822
WE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO WEAR IT."

10:59.367 --> 11:01.744
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.414
I MEAN, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET
SOMEONE PHOTOGRAPHED IN PUBLIC

11:05.498 --> 11:08.292
WEARING THIS MONSTROSITY.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.711
- WELL, YOU'RE SMART,
VICTORIA.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.421
YOU'LL THINK OF SOMEONE.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.423
HI.
MELANIE MORETTI.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.717
<i>ASK MELANIE</i> AT WJVB.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.054
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE
AT THE CLEVELAND RADIO AWARDS.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.055
WHO AM I WEARING?

11:21.138 --> 11:23.391
MRS. LADYPANTS.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.101
YES, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.436
MRS. LADYPANTS.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.522
- OH, MY GOD,
THE WATER MAIN JUST BLEW!

11:29.605 --> 11:32.274
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO SUCK UP THIS WATER.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.407
- I HAVE SOMETHING.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.952
- HEY, HERE'S THE HERO.

11:43.035 --> 11:47.456
- YES, I USED THE LADYPANTS
DRESS TO PLUG THE GIANT LEAK.

11:47.540 --> 11:52.420
THE FORCE OF THE WATER TORE
THE DRESS RIGHT OFF MY BODY.

11:52.503 --> 11:57.133
REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID,
BECAUSE IT HAD A BUILT-IN PANT,

11:57.216 --> 12:01.846
THAT I DIDN'T NEED
TO WEAR UNDERWEAR?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.974
I REALLY WISH I HAD.

12:05.057 --> 12:08.227
- WELL, AT LEAST MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE SAW IT ON YOUTUBE.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.522
- SOMEBODY POSTED IT
ON YOUTUBE?

12:11.605 --> 12:12.982
- WELL, I HAD TO,
AND IT WORKED.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.775
- OH.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.653
- AND THE LADYPANTS LAWYERS
SAID THAT I NO LONGER GET

12:17.736 --> 12:19.655
TO WEAR THAT GOWN.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.949
- SO WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING

12:22.032 --> 12:24.201
IS THAT I MADE
THE BIGGEST SACRIFICE FOR YOU.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.287
- YOU?

12:26.370 --> 12:28.622
I HAVE AN ADAM'S APPLE.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.207
- I TOUCHED DEAD BODIES.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.834
- I CLEANED PORT-A-POTTIES.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.002
- CHICAGO.
- NEW YORK!

12:33.085 --> 12:35.504
- VAN CLEEF!
- PETROSSIAN!

12:35.588 --> 12:37.381
- STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.216
I HAVE LESS THAN TWO HOURS

12:39.300 --> 12:41.343
TO CHOOSE MY PLUS-ONE
FOR THE ACADEMY AWARDS,

12:41.427 --> 12:44.430
AND ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS STRESSING ME OUT.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.848
I'M GOING TO THE SPA.

12:45.931 --> 12:49.268
I'M GONNA SIT IN THE SAUNA
AND GONNA CLEAR MY HEAD.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.645
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, VICTORIA,
JUST YOU AND YOUR THOUGHTS.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.189
YOUR AMAZING THOUGHTS!

12:53.272 --> 12:55.357
- YES, TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED,

12:55.441 --> 12:57.443
MY DEAR, DEAR FRIEND!

13:04.116 --> 13:06.744
- I THINK I MAY JUST GO
FOR A WALK.

13:06.827 --> 13:10.789
- AND I MAY GO
CHECK THE MAIL.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.341
VICTORIA, WAIT FOR ME!
- WAIT FOR ME!

13:22.968 --> 13:25.221
- IT WAS NICE OF JOY
TO VOLUNTEER TO PARK MY CAR.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.056
- IT REALLY WAS.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.142
- YOU BRING OUT THE BEST
IN EVEN THE WORST PEOPLE.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.061
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO RELAX IN THE SAUNA,

13:32.144 --> 13:33.562
AND I'LL SIGN IN
FOR ALL THREE OF US?

13:33.646 --> 13:34.897
- OH, THAT'S SWEET OF YOU.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.191
THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.067
- OH, MY GOD.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.362
WAS THAT VICTORIA CHASE?
- YES, IT WAS.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.364
AND SHE DESPERATELY NEEDS
YOUR HELP.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.283
SEE, THERE'S THIS CRAZY
TRANSVESTITE STALKER

13:46.367 --> 13:48.077
FOLLOWING HER.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.745
AND IF HE SHOWS UP HERE,

13:49.828 --> 13:52.039
IT IS IMPERATIVE
THAT YOU CALL SECURITY.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.415
YOU CAN'T MISS HIM.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.585
CRAZY SHORT SHORTS
AND A HUGE ADAM'S APPLE.

13:59.838 --> 14:03.175
- I WONDER
WHAT'S KEEPING JOY.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.969
- OH, SHE PROBABLY GOT
A TEXT FROM MITCH.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.220
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER HE CALLS
OR TEXTS,

14:06.303 --> 14:08.305
SHE JUST DROPS EVERYTHING.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.100
IMAGINE IF HE TEXTED HER
AT THE OSCARS.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.727
YOU'D BE ALL ALONE
ON THE RED CARPET.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.814
NO ONE TO YELL,
"OH, MY GOD,

14:16.897 --> 14:17.982
"VICTORIA CHASE
AND JENNIFER LAWRENCE

14:18.065 --> 14:20.818
LOOK JUST LIKE SISTERS!"

14:20.901 --> 14:23.904
- WELL, SOMEBODY ELSE
WILL PROBABLY SAY IT.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.658
- I AM NOT A TRANSVESTITE!

14:27.741 --> 14:28.993
OR A STALKER!

14:29.076 --> 14:30.077
I AM A WOMAN!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.621
- WITH THAT ADAM'S APPLE?

14:32.705 --> 14:35.249
LOOK, BUDDY,
SECURITY'S ON ITS WAY.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.126
SO IF YOU DON'T WANNA GET
ARRESTED, I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.502
NOW.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.795
ALSO...

14:39.878 --> 14:42.631
HERE'S MY NUMBER.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.593
- [grunts]

14:45.676 --> 14:48.846
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA CALL
THE OSCAR PEOPLE RIGHT NOW

14:48.929 --> 14:50.514
AND TELL THEM
YOU'RE MY PLUS-ONE.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.851
- NOT SO FAST.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.727
- HOW DID YOU GET IN?

14:54.810 --> 14:57.229
- I HAD TO PROVE
TO THE RECEPTIONIST

14:57.313 --> 14:59.273
THAT I'M A WOMAN.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.482
- YOU TOOK OFF YOUR TOP?

15:00.566 --> 15:04.403
- THAT DIDN'T WORK.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.746
I HATE TO BURDEN YOU WITH THIS,
BUT AS YOUR BEST FRIEND,

15:13.829 --> 15:15.497
I NEED TO TELL YOU
THAT YOUR FRIEND MELANIE

15:15.581 --> 15:17.166
IS MEAN AND DECEITFUL.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.669
- FIRST OF ALL,
I'M VICTORIA'S BEST FRIEND.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.380
AND IF ANYONE'S BEING DECEITFUL,
IT'S JOY.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.383
- LADIES, LADIES, I CAN'T
FAULT YOU FOR FIGHTING OVER ME,

15:26.467 --> 15:30.095
BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT
YOU'RE BOTH MY BEST FRIENDS.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.181
- NO, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A BEST BEST FRIEND.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.892
AND ISN'T THAT THE PERSON THAT'S
ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR YOU?

15:34.975 --> 15:38.854
- OH, YOU MEAN LIKE HOW
I POISONED SUSAN LUCCI FOR HER?

15:38.937 --> 15:40.356
- I SEDUCED A CANNIBAL
FOR HER.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.690
- OH, PLEASE!

15:41.774 --> 15:44.193
I SEDUCED COUNTLESS MEN
FOR VICTORIA.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.404
IN FACT, I'M SO DEVOTED,
I MARRIED VICTORIA.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.531
- YOU ALSO DIVORCED HER.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.617
AS I RECALL, IT WAS A MEAN
AND CONTENTIOUS DIVORCE.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.202
- IT WAS NOT!

15:53.285 --> 15:56.497
HOW DARE YOU INSULT
OUR BEAUTIFUL UNION?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.040
- OH, PLEASE.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.667
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN COUNT
HOW MANY TIMES

15:59.750 --> 16:01.919
I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF,
BROKEN THE LAW

16:02.002 --> 16:05.881
AND MY OWN STANDARDS OF DECENCY
JUST TO DO THINGS FOR VICTORIA.

16:05.964 --> 16:09.009
- WELL, TAKE YOUR NUMBER
AND DOUBLE IT.

16:09.093 --> 16:14.390
AND REMEMBER, MY STANDARDS
ARE LOWER THAN YOURS.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.517
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.687
YOU AND I HAVE RISKED
OUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,

16:19.770 --> 16:22.356
LIVES, AND SELF-WORTH
FOR VICTORIA.

16:22.439 --> 16:26.568
AND NOW WE'RE FIGHTING
AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR VICTORIA?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.363
- WE SHOULD BE BANDING TOGETHER
AGAINST HER.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.950
- OOH, I DO NOT LIKE
THE WAY THIS IS GOING.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.119
- NEITHER DO WE.
COME ON, JOY. LET'S GO.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.578
- GOOD-BYE, VICTORIA.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.163
[text alert beeps]

16:38.247 --> 16:40.749
- OH, MY GOD.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.086
I JUST GOT INVITED
TO THE ELTON JOHN OSCAR PARTY.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.546
PLUS ONE.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.090
- OH, PLEASE TAKE ME!
I'M HIS BIGGEST FAN!

16:48.173 --> 16:50.259
- NO, TAKE ME.
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.176
- [gasps]
- NO, BUT YOU JUST SAID--

16:51.260 --> 16:52.928
- I WAS JUST
TRYING TO DRAW MELANIE OUT,

16:53.011 --> 16:54.930
SO SHE'D REVEAL
HER TRUE FEELINGS ABOUT YOU.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.265
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING!
- LIAR!

16:56.348 --> 16:57.933
- YOU'RE THE LIAR!

16:58.016 --> 16:59.601
IF YOU TAKE HER TO THAT PARTY,
SHE'S GONNA EMBARRASS YOU

16:59.685 --> 17:01.603
BY ASKING ELTON IF SHE LOOKS
LIKE KATE BECKINSALE.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.772
- I DO LOOK
LIKE KATE BECKINSALE!

17:03.856 --> 17:06.608
- RIGHT NOW YOU LOOK LIKE
NATE BECKINSALE.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.278
- YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.573
- MAKE ME, DUDE.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.454
- I OWE YOU BOTH AN APOLOGY.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.750
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD YOU
COMPETE FOR THAT OSCAR TICKET.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.502
AND SO I DECIDED THAT
THE FAIREST THING TO DO

17:25.586 --> 17:26.962
IS TO PUT BOTH YOUR NAMES
IN A HAT

17:27.045 --> 17:28.756
AND JUST CHOOSE
MY PLUS-ONE BLINDLY.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.049
BUT FIRST
I WANT TO READ TO YOU

17:31.133 --> 17:35.137
MY OSCAR ACCEPTANCE SPEECH
THAT ELKA WROTE.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.348
- AS WRITTEN, PLEASE.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.226
LET THE WORDS DO THE WORK.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.272
- WRITERS.
[chuckles]

17:45.355 --> 17:47.858
- ACTORS.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.322
- "THANK YOU
FOR THIS INCREDIBLE HONOR.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.617
"THANK YOU TO THE ACADEMY,
TO OUR BRILLIANT PRODUCERS

17:56.700 --> 18:00.788
TODD MILLINER,
JOSH AND JOEL MANDEL"--

18:00.871 --> 18:02.623
NO, NO.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.541
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I WANT TO SAY.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.420
I NEED TO SPEAK
FROM THE HEART.

18:08.504 --> 18:12.674
HERE'S THE SPEECH
THAT I'D REALLY RATHER GIVE.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.135
I WANT TO THANK
MY TWO BEST FRIENDS.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.054
YES, TWO.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.307
FOR 30 YEARS,
WE HAVE HAD EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

18:20.390 --> 18:24.520
WE HAVE SHARED EACH OTHER'S
TRIUMPHS AND HEARTBREAKS,

18:24.603 --> 18:26.688
MADE THE HARD TIMES
GOOD TIMES

18:26.772 --> 18:29.858
AND THE GOOD TIMES
GREAT TIMES.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.861
MELANIE MORETTI
AND JOY SCROGGS,

18:32.945 --> 18:34.822
I SHARE THIS AWARD WITH YOU

18:34.905 --> 18:37.074
AS I SHARE MY LIFE WITH YOU.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.659
- OH, VICTORIA.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.911
THAT IS SO...

18:40.994 --> 18:43.539
- LOVELY AND KIND.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.916
AND WE FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY
ABOUT YOU.

18:45.999 --> 18:50.879
- OH, GUYS,
I'M SO SORRY.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.381
- WHY DID WE EVER FIGHT
ABOUT THIS?

18:52.464 --> 18:55.050
- I KNOW.
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.261
- WE WOULD NEVER ASK YOU
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.595
- [sighs]

18:58.679 --> 19:04.059
- SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ELKA
TO THE OSCARS?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.395
- ME?

19:06.478 --> 19:08.564
GO TO THE OSCARS?

19:08.647 --> 19:11.608
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A DREAM.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.902
- WELL, THEN IT'S SETTLED.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.696
ELKA, YOU ARE MY PLUS-ONE.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.240
- COME ON, MELANIE.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.243
HELP ME OPEN
A CELEBRATORY BOTTLE OF WINE.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.661
WE'LL TOAST TO ELKA.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.079
- HEY, DO WE STILL HAVE

19:24.163 --> 19:25.455
THAT GREAT BOTTLE OF BORDEAUX
I BOUGHT?

19:25.539 --> 19:30.085
- OH, SORRY, I FINISHED IT UP
FOR BREAKFAST.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.754
- THAT WAS
A $1,000 BOTTLE OF WINE.

19:32.838 --> 19:37.009
- IT REALLY BROUGHT OUT
THE SUBTLE FLAVORS OF MY EGGO.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.891
- WOW.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.058
YOUR PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.102
THEY TOTALLY FELL
FOR THE FAKE SPEECH.

19:47.185 --> 19:50.105
- I TOLD YOU THEY WOULD.
- OH.

19:50.188 --> 19:53.192
AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.277
AND I MEANT
EVERY WORD I SAID.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.447
- BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE
THAT SPEECH, ARE YOU?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.407
- WELL, WHY NOT?

20:00.490 --> 20:04.912
- NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR NONCELEBRITY FRIENDS.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.999
I KNOW THEM,
AND I DON'T CARE.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.751
- ELKA, CAN YOU BELIEVE
