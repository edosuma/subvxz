02:37.885 --> 02:39.285
[Clarice] Of course.

02:40.445 --> 02:41.645
[chuckles] We're happy.

02:45.925 --> 02:48.045
It is an honor to be his godfather.

02:52.685 --> 02:54.125
Here he is.

02:55.085 --> 02:58.885
He will have wealth and influence
beyond any man's dreams.

03:01.045 --> 03:02.245
And a family.

03:02.325 --> 03:04.685
We will build a new family of our own
soon enough.

03:07.525 --> 03:09.925
Things are no better with your uncle?

03:10.005 --> 03:12.805

and the Priori

Luca, we need to talk.

[Lorenzo clears throat]

03:33.685 --> 03:34.925
It's not yet common knowledge

03:35.005 --> 03:37.725
but Galeazzo Sforza's
acquired the city of Imola.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.805
Now is our chance to secure it.

03:40.885 --> 03:44.005
Deal with Sforza? He cannot be trusted.

03:44.365 --> 03:46.805
Must you see a cloud stitched
to every silver lining, Luca?

03:46.885 --> 03:48.245
If... If he will sell it,

03:48.325 --> 03:50.805
Florence would be strong enough
to become a true republic.

03:52.005 --> 03:54.605
Should this chimera you chase
dictate policy?

03:55.565 --> 03:59.445
What? A city where every man
stands equal before the law?

04:00.445 --> 04:04.125
Where every citizen has a real say
in the decisions that affect them.

04:04.205 --> 04:07.165
-Why is that impossible?
-It sounds pretty enough,

04:07.245 --> 04:10.085
but what it means in reality
is "ruled by the mob."

04:10.165 --> 04:13.045
Ah, so you doubt the ability of the people
to run their own city?

04:13.725 --> 04:16.565
We were common merchants not long ago,

04:16.645 --> 04:19.325
what right do we have
to withhold that right from others?

04:19.405 --> 04:23.205
Luca, if we do not
strengthen this republic,
we will wake to find ourselves
ruled by a tyrant.

04:27.845 --> 04:30.525
I know. I know that Galeazzo Sforza is...

04:31.885 --> 04:32.845
unreliable.

04:34.525 --> 04:35.525
And what choice do I have?

04:36.845 --> 04:39.325
I'm to attend
the marriage of his daughter in Milan.

04:40.085 --> 04:42.805
And press him to sell Imola
before anyone else does.

04:54.925 --> 04:57.085
What news couldn't be entrusted
to a messenger?

04:57.165 --> 04:59.405
The news we've been waiting so long for.

04:59.725 --> 05:01.085
A chance to weaken the Medici.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.605
Must I wait all day to hear it?

05:03.685 --> 05:08.245
Rumor has it
Galeazzo Sforza now owns Imola.

05:09.645 --> 05:10.725
And may sell it.

05:12.725 --> 05:15.325
The Pope has long had an interest
in gaining control of it.

05:15.685 --> 05:18.325
Now is the journey
worth your precious time?
With it, the papal states
would surround Florence,

05:21.525 --> 05:23.525
have a chokehold on its trade with Venice.

05:23.605 --> 05:24.445
Sit.

05:26.605 --> 05:29.885
Lorenzo cannot afford
to let Sixtus have Imola.

05:29.965 --> 05:34.645
It is the perfect opportunity to drive
a wedge between the Medici and the papacy.

05:35.205 --> 05:36.605
You would lose from it, too.

05:37.245 --> 05:41.085
Not if the Pazzi bank were to take
the papal account from the Medici.

05:42.485 --> 05:45.125
Sixtus will never entrust
his financial affairs

05:45.205 --> 05:46.645
to a man who has no heir.

05:48.005 --> 05:50.125
A bank without a future.

05:51.365 --> 05:53.725
You must win over Francesco.

05:54.205 --> 05:57.125
Why don't you inform Sixtus about Imola

05:57.205 --> 06:00.165
and see he appreciates
the urgency of acquiring it?

06:02.085 --> 06:03.925
You can leave Francesco to me.

[guests reveling]

07:24.765 --> 07:25.765
Is it custom...

07:26.925 --> 07:28.885
for a girl in Milan
to be marrying so young?

07:30.525 --> 07:32.605
[Galeazzo] She's 12. It's legal.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.925
Caterina was illegitimate.

07:35.005 --> 07:37.645
Marrying the Pope's nephew
was more than she had any right to expect.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.965
Messer Medici, you didn't travel here
to question Caterina's marriage.

07:43.645 --> 07:45.165
He's here to try and buy Imola.

07:49.525 --> 07:50.525
Are you not?

07:52.205 --> 07:54.205
Yes. You're right, Ma donna.

07:55.925 --> 07:56.885
As a favor.

07:58.405 --> 08:01.605
-A favor?
-The city's famously hard to govern.

08:02.445 --> 08:06.725
-If there is trouble, we will crush it.
-[chuckles] Yes, that may be, but, uh...

08:08.365 --> 08:12.365
it won't be cheap to keep a city
like Imola garrisoned indefinitely.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.805

why not now?

Purpose.

09:23.845 --> 09:25.845
You must find your place in the world,

09:26.285 --> 09:27.325

09:32.605 --> 09:34.205
What place is that?

and the family.

09:42.685 --> 09:44.365

11:11.405 --> 11:12.485
Thank you for coming.

11:13.725 --> 11:15.405
I came only to tell you

11:15.485 --> 11:19.245
there can be no communication between us
that my husband is not aware of.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.805
You didn't tell Francesco
you were coming here today.

11:25.885 --> 11:26.885
Why?

11:30.845 --> 11:34.525
He will not talk with me about anything
but business of the bank.

11:35.405 --> 11:38.325
My husband treats you as he does
with good reason.

11:38.925 --> 11:40.245
It was not him,

11:40.325 --> 11:43.445
but your hatred of the Medici
that cost you your family.

12:04.925 --> 12:08.765

12:09.445 --> 12:10.845
And each time...

12:12.685 --> 12:14.605
he chose to tear them from her.

12:18.725 --> 12:20.005
I'm sorry.

12:22.885 --> 12:24.765
She could bear it no more,

12:29.605 --> 12:30.845
Hmm.

12:32.805 --> 12:34.885
Francesco is like a son to me.

12:39.565 --> 12:42.725
You see, nothing can be done
to heal this wound.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.605
-Guglielmo will have a child soon.
-A Medici.

12:53.445 --> 12:55.405
Guglielmo is dead to me.

12:59.565 --> 13:00.565
I must go.

13:01.085 --> 13:02.045
Very well.

13:05.445 --> 13:08.165
You weren't at the wedding
of the Forli's first son Angelo

13:08.245 --> 13:09.765
a few years ago, were you?
No. Why do you ask?

13:13.565 --> 13:14.725
No reason.

13:16.285 --> 13:17.845
But you are quite sure?

13:19.325 --> 13:22.565
Quite. On reflection,
I'm sure I do not even know them.

13:43.765 --> 13:45.845
Straight in. In you go.

13:48.725 --> 13:49.765
In the corner, please.

13:51.285 --> 13:52.165
Put it here.

13:54.245 --> 13:57.405
-A birthing chair, so soon?
-It's a precaution, Ma donna.

13:57.965 --> 14:00.805
-We do not want to be ill prepared.
-Yes, don't be frightened.

14:01.205 --> 14:04.085
I'm not. Not for myself.

14:04.805 --> 14:06.725
I so want to give Guglielmo a boy.

14:07.085 --> 14:09.685
I was scared, too, when I carried Lorenzo.

14:09.805 --> 14:12.125
But I remember
your grandmother Contessina telling me

14:12.205 --> 14:15.085
that husbands not only look to their wives
for children,

14:15.805 --> 14:18.125
but for a sharp mind and a loyal heart.

14:18.765 --> 14:19.845
And you...

14:20.685 --> 14:21.645
have both.

14:22.365 --> 14:25.165
-[footsteps approaching]
-[both chuckling]

14:27.685 --> 14:29.845
Sister. How are you?

14:30.805 --> 14:32.525
[sighs] In need of distraction.

14:33.885 --> 14:35.245
How was the wedding?

14:37.045 --> 14:37.925
Unique.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.445
[Lucrezia] And Imola?

14:43.605 --> 14:47.685
-The city's always been prone to unrest.
-Then we'll place one of our own there.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.885
Someone whose loyalty
cannot be questioned.

14:50.245 --> 14:51.725
I'll approach Francesco.

14:52.765 --> 14:56.725
He understands that Imola is key
to strengthening our ties with Venice.

14:57.165 --> 14:59.845
Hopefully pulling her into an alliance
with Milan and Florence.

14:59.925 --> 15:03.405
I'm not questioning your vision
for our city.

15:03.845 --> 15:05.605
But trust must be earned.

15:05.845 --> 15:07.445
Well, what better way to earn it.

15:07.925 --> 15:11.125
-Have you considered your brother?
-No.

15:11.205 --> 15:13.725
And this isn't right for him.
It's not what he wants.

15:13.805 --> 15:16.285
What Giuliano wants is to feel needed.

15:18.005 --> 15:20.245
Now you've made Francesco
godfather to your son,

15:20.325 --> 15:22.325
at least offer Imola to your brother.

15:29.045 --> 15:31.805
Signor Francesco,
we need your signature on this page.

15:50.565 --> 15:51.565
Thank you.

15:53.445 --> 15:57.005
-Francesco, I wish to apologize.
-What for?

15:59.365 --> 16:02.325
For meeting your wife,
without your consent.

16:05.725 --> 16:06.925
I'm sorry. I...

16:08.485 --> 16:11.085
-I assumed she had told you.
-Of course she told me.

16:13.525 --> 16:14.525
Yes, of course.

16:15.205 --> 16:17.085
Please, don't be angry with her.

16:17.165 --> 16:20.485
I had hoped she might help
effect a reconciliation between us.

16:21.445 --> 16:22.925
I assure you she...

16:23.605 --> 16:24.965
She was very clear.

16:26.445 --> 16:29.005
All fault for the current situation
is mine.

16:36.485 --> 16:41.085
I would ask you to not speak with my wife
again under any circumstances.

16:43.245 --> 16:44.285
[Guglielmo] Brother.

16:45.285 --> 16:46.405
[Jacopo clears throat]

16:47.005 --> 16:49.205
As you wish. [clears throat]

16:56.605 --> 16:59.045
-I was looking for you.
-What brings you here?

16:59.125 --> 17:01.725
I need your help
to choose a name for the baby.

17:03.045 --> 17:04.165
You're scared for Bianca.

17:05.085 --> 17:06.085
You needn't be.

17:06.165 --> 17:07.765
Come on, let's get you a drink.

17:30.525 --> 17:33.124
[Salviati] Imola has long been
a subject of unrest.

17:34.365 --> 17:36.405
And the Duke is no doubt glad
to be rid of it.

17:39.245 --> 17:43.685
I believe Sforza has already
accepted an offer from Lorenzo de' Medici

17:43.765 --> 17:45.245
on behalf of Florence.

17:48.325 --> 17:49.645
[Pope] What if he has?

17:51.245 --> 17:55.045
Well, Florence's trade route to Venice
will be protected by Imola.

17:56.045 --> 17:59.205
The relationship between
these two great cities will flourish...

17:59.885 --> 18:02.525
at some cost to the papal states.

18:06.325 --> 18:11.725
Also, Lorenzo has already strengthened
Florence's treaty with Milan.

18:12.205 --> 18:15.165
If he were to now draw Venice
into that alliance

18:16.005 --> 18:20.685
he could cut off your own trade
with the north whenever he chose.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.645
Has Florence paid for Imola yet?

18:27.285 --> 18:29.005
Not to my knowledge, Holiness.

18:29.685 --> 18:32.205
So, there may yet be time
to convince Sforza

18:32.285 --> 18:35.365
to invest in your nephew Riario's future.

18:39.605 --> 18:40.965
It would please his family.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.085
And it will be to the benefit of Imola.

18:45.285 --> 18:49.125
The Church's involvement could only help
ensure peace in that troubled city.

18:51.365 --> 18:53.245
You will make my case to the Duke.

18:54.725 --> 18:58.885
I cannot see Sforza choosing the Medici
over the good of the Church, Holiness.

19:00.325 --> 19:02.525
As any good Christian,

19:03.165 --> 19:04.845
he fears excommunication.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.125
He has no need to fear it.

19:10.725 --> 19:11.725
Of course.

19:30.325 --> 19:31.605
[Lorenzo] Thank you, Nori.

19:31.685 --> 19:33.885
Make sure the messenger does not stop
until he reaches Milan.

19:34.205 --> 19:35.365
Very good, Messer.

19:36.245 --> 19:37.445
Giuliano.

19:39.285 --> 19:40.525
My God! [chuckles]

19:41.045 --> 19:42.925
It's been so long
since I last saw you properly,

19:43.005 --> 19:43.965
I've forgotten what you look like.

19:44.045 --> 19:45.925
Oh, I've been sitting for Sandro.

19:47.525 --> 19:48.605
We need to talk.

19:49.965 --> 19:50.805
About what?

19:51.845 --> 19:54.565
You have a new family, a new life.
New brother even.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.285
Come on, it was not my intention
to exclude you.

20:04.325 --> 20:05.365
I need you.

20:05.925 --> 20:07.925
I need you to take charge of Imola for me.

20:12.325 --> 20:13.685
Did Mother tell you to offer me that?

20:14.765 --> 20:15.645
Well...

20:17.085 --> 20:18.685
Look, you're my only brother.

20:19.445 --> 20:20.485
And I trust you.

20:23.485 --> 20:24.725
I can't leave Florence.

20:26.005 --> 20:27.045
Because...

20:27.885 --> 20:29.925
I'm your brother, and you can trust me.

20:30.885 --> 20:33.925
Others are bound to you by
political expediency and shared beliefs,

20:34.005 --> 20:34.885
but I'm your blood.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.325
Still right now, I must go.

20:39.085 --> 20:40.485
Sandro awaits.

20:41.005 --> 20:42.565
Is Vespucci's wife sitting?

20:46.645 --> 20:49.005
Is she the real reason
that you won't leave Florence?

20:50.245 --> 20:51.885
Offer Imola to your new brother.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.525
He's the one
you want to give it to anyway.

21:09.485 --> 21:10.765
[Francesco] You spoke to my uncle.

21:21.245 --> 21:22.365
Forgive me.

21:22.965 --> 21:24.405
He requested the meeting.

21:25.805 --> 21:26.925
I should've told you.

21:27.405 --> 21:28.445
[Francesco] Why didn't you?

21:29.325 --> 21:30.805
You would've said no.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.005
And yet...

21:34.205 --> 21:36.245
you are not happy like this.

21:36.645 --> 21:38.285
I thought I might help.

21:41.445 --> 21:42.605
Are you angry?

21:46.605 --> 21:47.685
With you?

21:52.925 --> 21:53.725
No.

21:57.085 --> 21:58.005
[Francesco] What did he want?

21:58.285 --> 22:00.045
To reunite his family.

22:00.645 --> 22:03.005
-Isn't that what you want?
-My uncle...

22:03.365 --> 22:05.285
smells out people's weaknesses...

22:06.725 --> 22:07.525
desires...

22:09.325 --> 22:11.445
then uses them to divide...

22:13.045 --> 22:13.965
manipulate...

22:15.245 --> 22:16.085
destroy.

22:18.645 --> 22:20.125
It was a mistake.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.205
It won't happen again.

22:35.565 --> 22:37.845
[people talking indistinctly]

22:39.725 --> 22:42.445
You have the experience
to help govern Imola.

22:43.285 --> 22:45.525
Along with your uncle,
you run the Pazzi bank

22:45.605 --> 22:47.565
and you have traveled widely
on its business.

22:48.085 --> 22:50.285
He still doesn't trust me fully, Luca.

22:51.605 --> 22:53.045
I mean no offense, but...

22:53.805 --> 22:58.005
I was raised to question every word
that fell from a Medici mouth.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.045
And old habits die hard.

23:01.445 --> 23:04.365
Well, maybe you're better off
far away from Jacopo.

23:06.365 --> 23:09.605
With Imola under our control,
I believe I can persuade Venice

23:09.685 --> 23:12.205
of the benefits of a joint alliance
with Milan and Florence,

23:12.285 --> 23:14.285
and then real work can begin.

23:14.845 --> 23:17.525
Building a better world in this city.

23:22.285 --> 23:24.725
Francesco, we need an answer.

23:27.005 --> 23:28.125
One last question.

23:30.525 --> 23:32.085
Why not offer Imola to Giuliano?

23:37.605 --> 23:38.525
I did.

23:39.525 --> 23:40.685
He refused.

23:43.485 --> 23:45.685
You wanted honesty, Francesco.

23:50.085 --> 23:52.685
Let us do this then. Together.

23:55.005 --> 23:56.245
[chuckles]

24:14.485 --> 24:16.645
[dogs barking]

24:19.925 --> 24:21.965
[dogs whining]

24:27.525 --> 24:29.285
[dogs growling]

24:34.605 --> 24:39.005
[Salviati] His Holiness had hoped that
he would be the one to purchase Imola.

24:40.125 --> 24:42.325
I gave Lorenzo my word it would be his.

24:42.405 --> 24:43.525
That is a great shame.

24:44.565 --> 24:46.605
The Pope planned for it
to be a wedding gift.

24:46.925 --> 24:49.885
For your daughter
and his nephew Girolamo Riario.

24:51.405 --> 24:54.285
Caterina would benefit greatly
from her husband's promotion.

24:54.365 --> 24:56.125
My daughter is provided for.

24:56.925 --> 24:58.565
Please relay my apologies to the Pope.

24:59.445 --> 25:00.965
But Florence is Milan's ally.

25:03.805 --> 25:05.125
Tell them you have changed your mind.

25:07.245 --> 25:10.085
I will not stand for any man, priest

25:10.165 --> 25:11.965
or otherwise,
telling me what to do in my own house.

25:12.045 --> 25:13.405
[dog snarling]

25:21.605 --> 25:22.845
I spoke out of turn.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.045
Forgive me.

25:27.805 --> 25:32.125
I sought only to protect you
and the citizens of Milan.

25:32.685 --> 25:34.525
[laughs] Protect from what?

25:36.165 --> 25:40.165
His Holiness is devoted to his nephew.

25:43.205 --> 25:45.165
He would not excommunicate a city
over this.

25:48.805 --> 25:50.885
Trade with Milan would be forbidden.

25:51.645 --> 25:55.165
The dead would lie unburied.
Your people would suffer.

25:55.645 --> 25:57.525
But I believe you're looking at this
the wrong way.

25:59.205 --> 26:02.845
Rather than guessing
what His Holiness may or may not do,

26:02.925 --> 26:04.525
perhaps you should ask yourself,

26:05.805 --> 26:07.845
"What am I prepared to risk?"

26:18.165 --> 26:19.325
Thank you.

26:28.605 --> 26:30.845
I am to govern Imola
on Florence's behalf.

26:32.565 --> 26:35.765
I, I thought I should tell you in person.

26:47.525 --> 26:49.685
Let me be the first to congratulate you.

26:59.325 --> 27:00.725
-I thought--
-What?

27:01.125 --> 27:03.765
I want you as my heir
but I will not beg you.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.405
You must be your own man.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.365
And the Priori will have to
approve it, of course,

27:11.445 --> 27:13.325
but I will not stand in your way.

27:17.805 --> 27:18.685
Thank you.

27:24.125 --> 27:27.365
Novella never told you
about our meeting, did she?

27:28.965 --> 27:31.325
So if I hadn't, you would've never known.

27:34.325 --> 27:36.605
Do you ever wonder about her arrival here?

27:38.925 --> 27:41.005
Never struck you as strange...

27:41.085 --> 27:44.205
that she came to Florence
when she did at Lorenzo's invitation?

27:44.285 --> 27:46.605
Novella came to attend
the marriage of her friend,

27:46.685 --> 27:48.125
-Bianca.
-Yes.

27:48.245 --> 27:51.085
If that is what she told you
then it must be the truth.

27:52.125 --> 27:54.845
Or a lie Lorenzo told her to spin.

27:55.525 --> 27:56.965
What do you mean by that?

27:57.765 --> 27:59.765
Open your eyes, Francesco.

28:01.445 --> 28:04.085
Lorenzo has played you
for a fool from the start.

28:04.165 --> 28:07.605
Right now he's at his dinner table
laughing at you with all the other Medici.

28:08.965 --> 28:11.325
Go to Imola, if you choose.

28:11.405 --> 28:14.485
But don't delude yourself
you aren't being manipulated.

28:30.005 --> 28:31.285
Have you seen Francesco?

28:32.845 --> 28:34.445
You lost your guest of honor.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.125
Yeah, move.
Novella.

28:42.205 --> 28:43.645
I'm looking for your husband.

28:44.045 --> 28:45.165
He should be here soon.

29:13.925 --> 29:15.605
Sorry I'm late, I was at the bank.

29:17.605 --> 29:18.485
Problem?

29:22.125 --> 29:24.525
[indistinct chattering]

29:38.245 --> 29:41.045
I was blessed you came to Florence
when you did.

29:42.765 --> 29:44.005
So much of life is chance.

29:45.605 --> 29:48.245
It was chance, wasn't it,
that we met?

29:48.885 --> 29:50.125
Or fate?

29:50.485 --> 29:51.845
-Or fate.
-Messer?

29:55.525 --> 29:56.325
[exhales]

29:56.405 --> 29:58.085
Francesco, what is it?

29:58.885 --> 29:59.685
Nothing.

30:00.485 --> 30:04.685
Maestro, it has been over a year
since you started on this commission.

30:05.445 --> 30:07.605
When will my wife ever be free of you?

30:09.605 --> 30:12.325
Isn't the price the same
however long it takes, Sandro?

30:13.205 --> 30:14.765
-It is.
-Then...

30:15.405 --> 30:17.005
the longer it takes
more of a bargain it is.

30:17.645 --> 30:18.685
After all,

30:19.205 --> 30:20.165
this man is a genius.

30:20.685 --> 30:21.845
Well, I'm not sure about that.

30:24.845 --> 30:27.565
Excuse me, I need some air.

30:31.165 --> 30:34.485
To this day, I can barely believe
she married me.

30:37.525 --> 30:38.685
Neither can we.

30:54.685 --> 30:56.005
This is reckless.

30:56.685 --> 30:58.805
You were reckless and drunk.

30:59.805 --> 31:01.405
You make me both.

31:05.325 --> 31:07.325
That's why I could never have left
for Imola.

31:07.605 --> 31:10.285
Lorenzo asked you to go
before Francesco...

31:10.365 --> 31:11.765
and you refused?

31:12.685 --> 31:13.485
Why?
Because of us?

31:28.645 --> 31:30.605
[Lorenzo clears throat] A toast...

31:31.285 --> 31:34.725
Florence's new representative
in Imola, my dear,

31:34.805 --> 31:36.205
dear friend...

31:37.285 --> 31:38.485
Francesco Pazzi.

31:40.285 --> 31:42.485
[in unison] Francesco.

31:51.325 --> 31:53.365
You are concerned about Francesco.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.605
He's not himself.

31:57.605 --> 31:59.125
He's so innocent.

32:00.405 --> 32:02.205
This world is so dark.

32:02.845 --> 32:05.405
His father is dedicated
to bring light to it.

32:05.485 --> 32:06.925
He will guide him.

32:08.525 --> 32:10.205
Just like your father did.

32:12.485 --> 32:14.245
And our son has you.

32:15.405 --> 32:16.765
He looks lonely.

32:18.485 --> 32:21.085
Well, I think we should make
another brother or sister.

32:29.525 --> 32:31.045
[knocking on door]

32:31.725 --> 32:33.285
[both clear throat]

32:33.365 --> 32:34.405
Come in.

32:34.485 --> 32:36.045
[door opens]

32:36.525 --> 32:38.325
[dog barking]

32:44.645 --> 32:46.365
[door closes]

32:48.645 --> 32:49.925
What does it say?

32:52.325 --> 32:54.765
Sixtus is asking for a loan
to buy Imola.

32:55.365 --> 32:56.925
That must be a mistake.

32:57.005 --> 32:59.605
No. The letter bares the Pope's seal.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.525
Salviati has already been dispatched
to collect the money.

33:02.605 --> 33:03.805
So Sforza has agreed?

33:05.285 --> 33:07.285
But he already gave his word
Florence would have it.

33:08.965 --> 33:10.645
Go to Milan, speak to him yourself.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.205
No, it's too late.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.565
The Pope is supposed be to our ally,

33:20.685 --> 33:21.925
he cannot have Imola.

33:22.645 --> 33:24.205
But how can we stop him?

33:25.885 --> 33:27.645
The Medici will refuse the loan.

33:27.725 --> 33:30.165
Salviati will just approach
the other banks here.

33:30.245 --> 33:31.725
Well, they too must turn him down.

33:32.325 --> 33:33.365
Turn down the Pope?

33:33.725 --> 33:35.005
Look, how else are we to prevent this?

33:39.485 --> 33:40.365
Francesco?

33:41.685 --> 33:42.885
I agree.

33:43.645 --> 33:45.525
But I can't speak for my uncle.

33:46.005 --> 33:46.845
No.

33:47.565 --> 33:50.285
Jacopo will agree to the loan
in order to win favor with Sixtus.

33:50.365 --> 33:51.765
Then he'll use that influence

33:51.845 --> 33:53.805
to see the papal account
stripped from the Medici

33:53.965 --> 33:55.125
and given to the Pazzi.

33:55.205 --> 33:57.525
The revenues from our handling
of the papal alum alone

33:57.605 --> 34:01.845
bring more money into the bank coffers
than all of our other business combined.

34:14.244 --> 34:16.285
Can we use the debt of the Pazzi bank

34:16.365 --> 34:17.925
to undermine its shares?

34:21.045 --> 34:23.005
You would put our bank at risk,

34:23.724 --> 34:25.085
undermine your main competitor?

34:25.164 --> 34:28.164
Look, this is not about
our bank or your bank,

34:28.244 --> 34:29.845
this is about Florence.

34:30.644 --> 34:31.485
So you say.

34:31.965 --> 34:33.365
Look, I... I have

34:33.845 --> 34:35.885
no power over you, Francesco, none.

34:36.724 --> 34:38.164
The decision is yours.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.164
Though all of us

34:39.244 --> 34:40.724
must live with the consequences.

34:59.045 --> 35:00.485
It is...

35:01.125 --> 35:04.085
different to your other work.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.925
But it still glorifies God.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.165
It's magnificent.

35:10.445 --> 35:14.525
In fact, I drew some inspiration
from one of your poems, Poliziano.

35:14.605 --> 35:16.005
I have it here somewhere.

35:17.485 --> 35:18.645
Oh, sorry.

35:32.565 --> 35:33.685
What is this?

35:33.765 --> 35:34.965
An idea for another work.

35:35.045 --> 35:36.605
Merely an idea.

35:36.685 --> 35:37.925
Work?

35:39.725 --> 35:41.125
Using my wife.

35:44.045 --> 35:46.925
And to think I allowed her
to come and go from here freely.

35:47.005 --> 35:47.805
You, you misunderstand.

35:47.885 --> 35:50.205
-I understand everything.
-I can--

35:54.045 --> 35:58.085
My wife will never set foot
in your workshop again.

35:59.285 --> 36:01.485
No, Messer Vespucci. No, I...

36:08.605 --> 36:10.205
What did you mean before...

36:12.885 --> 36:16.765
when you talked of why my wife
really came to Florence?

36:19.005 --> 36:20.805
It is not my place.

36:20.885 --> 36:21.885
Speak.

36:24.125 --> 36:25.965
I did not want to but...

36:31.285 --> 36:33.325
when I asked to meet her

36:33.565 --> 36:35.485
it was in desperation.

36:36.245 --> 36:37.565
You would not speak to me

36:37.645 --> 36:40.645
and I wanted to heal the breach
between us.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.445
I did not expect her to come.

36:45.605 --> 36:46.765
But she did.

36:47.885 --> 36:48.965
Eagerly.

36:49.605 --> 36:51.525
And with many questions...

36:52.485 --> 36:53.885
about the bank...

36:55.125 --> 36:57.725
about our relationship,
about our family.

36:57.805 --> 37:02.245
I confessed I wondered who would benefit
from all this information.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.685
Who but Lorenzo.

37:09.725 --> 37:11.085
You're lying.

37:11.645 --> 37:12.845
I am lying?

37:16.285 --> 37:20.405
Lorenzo once told me
your wife was invited to Bianca's wedding.

37:20.485 --> 37:23.605
They had become good friends
after they had met,

37:23.685 --> 37:25.605
the marriage of Angelo da Forli.

37:27.205 --> 37:28.445
What of it?

37:29.605 --> 37:32.285
Your wife never attended
Angelo's marriage.

37:35.605 --> 37:38.085
She did not even know him,
she told me herself.

37:41.485 --> 37:45.205
Novella, came to Florence
at Lorenzo's invitation,

37:45.285 --> 37:46.685
not Bianca's.

37:48.765 --> 37:50.605
Do you think it was a coincidence

37:50.685 --> 37:55.085
that Clarice de' Medici was playing
matchmaker so soon after her arrival.

37:56.605 --> 37:58.485
Ask your wife to deny it.

38:01.765 --> 38:03.685
Maybe he had other reasons.

38:03.765 --> 38:06.325
Maybe he didn't just bring her here
to spy on you.

38:06.805 --> 38:08.645
God knows these Medici men

38:08.725 --> 38:11.365
can't get enough of bedding
other men's wives.

38:44.805 --> 38:46.965
What you were talking to Lorenzo about

38:47.045 --> 38:48.445
at the dinner held in my honor?

38:49.685 --> 38:50.765
Nothing.

38:52.325 --> 38:54.765
-He asked where you were.
-And what else?

38:57.645 --> 38:58.925
Is that all?

38:59.005 --> 39:00.685
What's wrong? What's this about?

39:01.605 --> 39:03.125
Bianca de' Medici

39:03.645 --> 39:05.325
is your close friend?

39:05.925 --> 39:08.125
-You know she is.
-Since when?

39:10.485 --> 39:12.925
When did you first become friends?

39:16.605 --> 39:18.005
I can't recall.

39:18.085 --> 39:21.605
Lorenzo said
it was at the da Forli wedding.

39:23.245 --> 39:24.045
Is that true?

39:26.965 --> 39:27.845
No.

39:28.405 --> 39:29.765
Because you were not there.

39:30.245 --> 39:31.245
That's right.

39:31.325 --> 39:32.445
So...

39:35.405 --> 39:38.685
if you were not invited to Florence
by Bianca...

39:40.285 --> 39:43.205
who did invite you?

39:44.565 --> 39:46.965
Francesco, this is such a small thing,

39:47.045 --> 39:49.205
I don't understand
why you're so upset...

39:51.405 --> 39:54.165
Who invited you?

39:55.165 --> 39:56.325
Lorenzo?

39:58.325 --> 40:00.085
-Who? Who?
-Francesco.

40:01.085 --> 40:04.565
The invitation was extended to my father
and included me.

40:05.565 --> 40:06.525
Why?

40:09.045 --> 40:10.365
Why did it include you?

40:10.845 --> 40:12.285
I don't know.

40:13.005 --> 40:14.045
It...

40:14.965 --> 40:16.605
You'd have to ask Lorenzo.

40:18.485 --> 40:19.565
Lorenzo.

40:20.125 --> 40:20.965
Yes.

40:23.405 --> 40:24.685
Francesco.

40:25.045 --> 40:26.725
Where are you going?

40:50.405 --> 40:53.325
His Holiness has given his word
to his nephew

40:53.405 --> 40:56.125
that he shall have Imola
as a wedding gift.

40:58.405 --> 41:01.765
He knew I would never give him the money
to purchase Imola.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.085
As you know...

41:05.845 --> 41:08.725
you will lose the papal account
as a result.

41:11.685 --> 41:13.125
So why are we here?

41:17.965 --> 41:20.765
I wanted to see your face

41:20.845 --> 41:23.845
as you heard that your bank was in ruins.

41:23.925 --> 41:25.885
As I saw my father's

41:25.965 --> 41:28.685
the day the Medici bank
called in its loans.

41:28.765 --> 41:30.485
As was its right.

41:31.685 --> 41:33.565
It was your father

41:34.325 --> 41:36.005
who ruined your family.

41:41.125 --> 41:44.205
This is the beginning of the end
for the Medici.

41:45.525 --> 41:47.285
This bank will survive

41:47.445 --> 41:49.805
without the papal account, Salviati.

41:50.525 --> 41:51.805
Even if it does...

41:52.605 --> 41:54.605
how long before the city turns on you

41:55.405 --> 41:57.365
once you've made an enemy
of the papacy?

42:16.445 --> 42:17.725
[man] I think I remember why--

42:17.805 --> 42:20.685
Go home go home. Get out.
There's no work for you this afternoon.

42:24.205 --> 42:25.405
She's not coming.

42:27.325 --> 42:29.205
Vespucci has forbidden it.

42:30.045 --> 42:31.165
Why?

42:31.245 --> 42:33.685
He suspects her of having an affair.

42:37.925 --> 42:39.605
Slow down. Slow down.

42:39.685 --> 42:41.285
It'll be both our heads for the noose.

42:42.005 --> 42:44.405
It's me he suspects, not you.

42:45.165 --> 42:47.965
And as it's not true and Vespucci
is in love with his wife

42:48.045 --> 42:50.365
I believe that Simonetta
can convince him of it.

42:54.325 --> 42:55.565
I could lose her.

42:55.645 --> 42:56.565
Yes, yes.

42:56.645 --> 42:59.045
And if you lose her, all the world
would have lost is another two lovers,

42:59.125 --> 43:01.925
if I lose her, I lose...

43:02.885 --> 43:04.285
What, an unfinished painting?

43:07.165 --> 43:08.405
This is nothing.

43:10.565 --> 43:11.405
See.

43:46.645 --> 43:48.085
[chuckling]

43:50.245 --> 43:51.605
You sure you're well enough?

43:52.165 --> 43:53.445
There'll be other meals.

43:53.805 --> 43:54.845
While I can,

43:54.925 --> 43:57.005
I'd like to enjoy a simple meal

43:57.085 --> 43:58.525
with the people I love.

44:01.685 --> 44:03.365
Well, to my sister...

44:04.125 --> 44:05.925
and the people that she loves.

44:09.565 --> 44:12.325
Ah, Francesco, please sit, join us.

44:12.405 --> 44:14.525
The papers you requested.

44:15.565 --> 44:18.565
The debts of the Pazzi Bank
and all you need to destroy it.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.485
Let's, uh...

44:20.565 --> 44:22.805
Let's discuss this another time, shall we?

44:22.885 --> 44:24.725
I don't wanna mix family and business.

44:24.805 --> 44:25.685
Why not?

44:26.365 --> 44:27.965
You had no problem doing so
when you asked my wife to spy for you.

44:32.765 --> 44:33.805
What are you talking about?

44:37.285 --> 44:38.485
This is Jacopo's doing.

44:38.565 --> 44:40.285
All he's done is to open my eyes.

44:41.045 --> 44:43.285
You would do well
to open yours too, brother.

44:43.365 --> 44:45.445
And see what exactly?

44:45.925 --> 44:48.125
That you want me to play a part
in the story

44:48.205 --> 44:50.045
that you wish to write for Florence.

44:50.125 --> 44:51.485
I've never hidden that from you.

44:51.605 --> 44:54.605
And what story would Jacopo
write in its place?

44:56.525 --> 44:57.645
You...

44:58.805 --> 45:00.845
You talk of a true republic

45:01.685 --> 45:04.725
of a government voted for in honest
and free elections.

45:04.805 --> 45:06.605
Accountable to the people

45:07.165 --> 45:10.325
of throwing off the dead hand of the past
and changing things.

45:10.405 --> 45:12.645
But that dead hand belongs to you.

45:12.725 --> 45:13.605
To your family...

45:13.885 --> 45:15.005
the Medici.

45:17.485 --> 45:20.605
Who have ruled Florence
for four generations.

45:22.925 --> 45:24.685
Jacopo's story,

45:26.045 --> 45:29.205
is one in which the Pazzi
liberate the city from them.

45:29.285 --> 45:30.725
rather than serve them.

45:33.205 --> 45:34.085
That man

45:34.525 --> 45:36.885
twists the truth to serve his purpose,

45:36.965 --> 45:39.125
don't let him break us apart.

45:39.805 --> 45:42.085
[groaning]

45:42.165 --> 45:43.085
The child.

45:43.485 --> 45:44.365
Here.

45:44.445 --> 45:45.925
-[groaning]
-Breathe.

45:46.005 --> 45:47.005
[Clarice] Fetch the midwife.

45:47.485 --> 45:48.565
[Lucrezia] To her room. Go, go.

45:49.725 --> 45:51.085
Get the room ready.

45:51.645 --> 45:53.365
Your nephew is about to be born.

45:54.005 --> 45:54.925
Stay.

45:55.605 --> 45:56.445
Let us talk.

45:57.725 --> 45:59.805
So you can convince me I'm wrong?

46:01.165 --> 46:04.645
If you wish to speak to me
I'll be at the Pazzi Bank with my uncle,

46:04.725 --> 46:06.805
overseeing the papal accounts.

46:26.485 --> 46:29.285
-[man] Ah, good evening...
-[woman] I do trust all is well?

46:30.725 --> 46:31.605
Giuliano.

46:32.805 --> 46:34.405
What if I'd been with my husband--

46:34.485 --> 46:35.765
When can I see you again?

46:35.845 --> 46:37.165
-You must leave.
-When?

46:37.245 --> 46:38.525
-Just--
-When?

46:39.485 --> 46:40.325
Never.

46:43.565 --> 46:45.885
-Giuliano.
-Simonetta, do not do this.

46:46.205 --> 46:48.005
-Let go of me.
-Why?

46:48.365 --> 46:50.405
Because Vespucci is suspicious of Sandro?

46:50.485 --> 46:51.605
No.

46:51.685 --> 46:54.685
I will not be a part of you
throwing your life away.

46:54.765 --> 46:56.445
Nor will I throw mine away.

46:56.965 --> 46:58.445
I have a husband.

46:59.365 --> 47:01.205
And you do not love me?

47:10.125 --> 47:12.085
[sighs] There you are.

47:16.365 --> 47:17.885
[groaning]

47:20.725 --> 47:22.365
[panting]

47:22.965 --> 47:24.405
Deep breaths.

47:24.845 --> 47:26.605
Please, wait outside.

47:29.525 --> 47:31.005
I will not leave the door, Bianca.

47:31.765 --> 47:32.885
I'm with you.

47:34.725 --> 47:36.165
[groaning]

47:39.645 --> 47:40.445
[woman] Here!

47:44.045 --> 47:45.365
[groaning continues]

47:56.165 --> 47:57.685
Call for Salviati.

48:00.165 --> 48:01.045
As you wish.

48:20.605 --> 48:22.045
It's never been done.

48:22.725 --> 48:24.285
That doesn't mean

48:24.685 --> 48:26.165
-that it can't be.
-[footsteps approaching]

48:26.245 --> 48:27.045
Now...

48:27.725 --> 48:30.125
-Is there news?
-No. Come. Tonight is for family.

48:30.205 --> 48:32.725
Well, convince Nori to do as I say.

48:33.245 --> 48:34.445
Messer Medici says that...

48:35.485 --> 48:39.965
legally, the alum trading rights
are separate from the papal accounts.

48:40.405 --> 48:42.405
That we can split them.

48:44.245 --> 48:45.925
Well, you're playing with fire.

48:46.005 --> 48:47.845
You may not have evidence of its debts.

48:48.525 --> 48:51.925
But Jacopo must have overextended the bank
to provide the loan.

48:52.085 --> 48:52.925
Yes.

48:53.085 --> 48:54.605
In the belief...

48:56.005 --> 48:58.245
that he can secure the papal account

48:59.605 --> 49:02.485
and the far more profitable
alum trading rights.

49:07.165 --> 49:08.285
If you do this

49:09.005 --> 49:11.045
it's only a matter of time
before there's open warfare

49:11.125 --> 49:12.205
between the Pazzi and the Medici.

49:31.885 --> 49:32.765
Francesco.

49:33.605 --> 49:36.325
You will return to your father's house
in Venice.

49:37.525 --> 49:38.565
Francesco!

49:39.045 --> 49:40.285
No!

49:40.365 --> 49:41.485
I won't go!

49:42.685 --> 49:44.125

50:13.005 --> 50:16.605
It is the only reasonable response,
Holiness.

50:19.325 --> 50:22.605
Lorenzo not only refused you the loan

50:22.685 --> 50:26.645
he forbade every other bank in Florence
from making it.

50:29.325 --> 50:32.685
I thought that we could work together.

50:33.245 --> 50:35.005
It is a sad day.

50:36.725 --> 50:39.765
In agreeing to loan you the money

50:39.845 --> 50:42.965
the Pazzi have defied
Lorenzo's sanctions.

50:43.485 --> 50:45.925
Because they wish to win the account
from the Medici.
