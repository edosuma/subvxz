04:33.358 --> 04:34.667
Would you look this way please?

04:35.728 --> 04:36.371
Okay!

04:55.443 --> 04:56.193
One moment.

05:00.044 --> 05:02.326
Mr. President, all systems activated.

05:02.741 --> 05:05.312
I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long.
- oh no, not at all.

05:05.369 --> 05:07.805
Congratulations Dr. Forbin.
It's a marvelous achievement.

05:07.976 --> 05:08.822
Thank you sir.

05:08.831 --> 05:10.607
Hear, Hear!
The limousine is ready for us.

05:12.596 --> 05:16.357
Of course it's gonna put me out of a job
and put the Pentagon in mothballs.

05:16.438 --> 05:19.104
Congratulations Dr. Forbin.
I'm quite sure that won't happen

05:19.333 --> 05:21.970
Listen to him.
He's more relieved than anybody.

05:22.204 --> 05:25.717
Our secretary of defense, the secretary of
state and myself

05:26.257 --> 05:29.108
had a discussion on our way out here
and as to the treatment needed

05:29.258 --> 05:31.000
we told the company about it.

05:31.518 --> 05:32.750
And hem..

05:33.244 --> 05:35.202
We all agreed
it should be simple and direct.

05:35.231 --> 05:35.761
Yes.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.148
Downgrade the biggest top-secret
in all history to a plain non-sequitur.

05:39.897 --> 05:42.097
Now, all we have to do
is tell the people about it.

05:42.728 --> 05:44.245
Thank you sir.

06:01.052 --> 06:02.142
My friends..

06:02.179 --> 06:03.727
Fellow citizens of the world.

06:04.554 --> 06:07.099
For years we have been delicately
and desperately poised

06:07.243 --> 06:08.801
upon the brink of a disaster

06:09.188 --> 06:11.357
too complete
and horrible to contemplate.

06:12.270 --> 06:14.530
There is an old saying:
Everyone makes mistakes

06:14.713 --> 06:17.168
but that is just
what man can no longer afford.

06:17.555 --> 06:20.692
For years, we here in the united states
have been working on that problem

06:21.116 --> 06:23.886
until now it's been our most
closely guarded secret

06:24.160 --> 06:26.807
involving great effort
and vast expenditure.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.975
But it has been met with success.

06:31.155 --> 06:33.313
As President of
the United states of America

06:33.368 --> 06:35.680
I can now tell you,
the people of the entire world

06:36.087 --> 06:38.277
that as of 3 Am. eastern standard time

06:38.845 --> 06:40.912
the defense of this nation

06:40.984 --> 06:43.315
and with it, the defense of the free world

06:43.743 --> 06:45.810
has been the responsibility of a machine.

06:47.380 --> 06:48.968
A system we call Colossus.

06:50.492 --> 06:52.846
Far more advanced
than anything previously built

06:53.871 --> 06:56.511
Capable of studying intelligence
and data fed to it.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.922
And on the basis of those facts only

06:59.240 --> 07:01.702
deciding if an attack
is about to be launched upon us.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.560
If it did decide
that an attack was imminent

07:04.698 --> 07:06.303
colossus would then act immediately

07:06.425 --> 07:08.225
for it controls its own weapons

07:08.421 --> 07:09.757
and can select and deliver

07:09.970 --> 07:11.485
whatever it considers appropriate.

07:12.634 --> 07:15.867
Colossus decisions are superior
to any we humans can make.

07:16.822 --> 07:19.200
For it can absorb
and process more knowledge

07:19.232 --> 07:22.059
than is remotely possible
for the greatest genius that ever lived.

07:23.687 --> 07:25.952
And even more important than that
it has no emotions.

07:26.515 --> 07:28.861
Knows no fear, no hate, no envy.

07:29.757 --> 07:31.843
It cannot act in a sudden fit of temper.

07:32.584 --> 07:34.963
Cannot act at all
so long as there is no threat.

07:36.210 --> 07:38.262
I would now like you to meet
Dr. Charles Forbin

07:38.747 --> 07:40.751
The world’s leading expert
on computer systems.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.746
And if you will..

07:42.773 --> 07:44.066
the father of Colossus.

07:46.497 --> 07:47.946
Thank you Mr. President.

07:48.443 --> 07:50.170
Ladies and gentlemen, I will..

07:50.326 --> 07:52.533
try to make this as simple as possible.

07:53.852 --> 07:57.616
The main memory and central processing units
are located here in the rocky mountains..

07:58.780 --> 08:01.078
Inside this particular mountain..

08:01.819 --> 08:02.968
In Colorado.

08:03.827 --> 08:06.549
And overlooking the Pacific Ocean
in California..

08:07.274 --> 08:08.813
the Colossus programing office

08:08.887 --> 08:11.078
oversees the entire operation.

08:13.289 --> 08:15.138
The computer center

08:15.993 --> 08:20.131
contains over one hundred thousand remote
censors and communication devices

08:20.767 --> 08:22.201
which monitor all

08:22.355 --> 08:25.394
electronic transmissions
such as microwaves, laser

08:26.233 --> 08:27.952
radio and television communications

08:28.863 --> 08:30.940
data communications from satellites

08:31.055 --> 08:32.480
in orbit all over the world.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.932
The entire system..

08:35.379 --> 08:38.424
is surrounded by fields
of intensified gamma radiation

08:38.450 --> 08:39.999
and other countermeasure devices.

08:41.957 --> 08:44.295
Colossus works
completely without human aid.

08:44.930 --> 08:46.560
We make no secret..

08:46.617 --> 08:48.083
of where Colossus is located

08:49.073 --> 08:51.835
nor do we intend to conceal
how it functions.

08:52.761 --> 08:55.180
You may rightfully say
that this leaves us wide open to an attack

08:55.229 --> 08:57.804
frontally and subversively
and if that attack were successful

08:58.642 --> 09:00.378
it would in effect leave us defenseless.

09:00.711 --> 09:01.841
However..

09:02.910 --> 09:05.632
Colossus
does have its own defense.

09:06.742 --> 09:08.257
It is its own defense.

09:08.639 --> 09:10.261
In case of an attack..

09:10.831 --> 09:13.887
on any of its information supply
or power lines..

09:14.459 --> 09:16.462
Colossus will switch on
the emergency circuits

09:16.535 --> 09:19.103
which will then take
the appropriate action.

09:19.509 --> 09:21.831
It is self-sufficient

09:22.545 --> 09:23.953
self-protected

09:24.223 --> 09:25.314
self-generated.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.116
It is impenetrable.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.274
In short..

09:31.323 --> 09:34.654
There's no way in.
No human being can touch it.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.050
Over here

09:40.008 --> 09:42.362
we have one of the many terminals

09:42.745 --> 09:43.843
directly hooked

09:44.529 --> 09:45.669
to the computer center.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.635
Through this

09:50.075 --> 09:51.810
Colossus can communicate with us,

09:52.909 --> 09:54.041
excuse me gentlemen,

09:55.303 --> 09:56.981
and through this machine

09:57.007 --> 09:59.351
we, in turn, can communicate with Colossus.

10:01.776 --> 10:03.445
Now, there's one last point.

10:04.651 --> 10:06.427
One inevitable question..

10:07.291 --> 10:09.556
which we have been asked
very frequently before.

10:11.589 --> 10:12.738
And that is..

10:14.164 --> 10:17.259
is Colossus capable of creative thought?

10:20.086 --> 10:21.804
Can it initiate new thought?

10:23.873 --> 10:26.065
I can tell you
that the answer to that is no.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.263
However
Colossus is a paragon of knowledge

10:30.289 --> 10:32.633
and his knowledge
can be expanded indefinitely.

10:34.877 --> 10:37.411
I hope, along with all the scientists who..

10:38.755 --> 10:40.499
helped make this particular project,

10:41.865 --> 10:44.839
that the immense power of this computer
will not only be used

10:45.539 --> 10:47.031
for the defense of this country

10:48.065 --> 10:51.862
but hopefully also as an aid to the solution
of the many problems we face on this earth

10:52.603 --> 10:55.080
and the many more problems
that we will face

10:55.528 --> 10:57.727
the more deeply we penetrate
into the universe.

10:59.164 --> 11:00.166
Thank you.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.087
Mr. President.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.305
Thank you Dr. Forbin.

11:08.176 --> 11:09.226
And so..

11:09.854 --> 11:11.426
my fellow human beings

11:12.522 --> 11:15.488
we all directly and
indirectly live in the shade

11:15.747 --> 11:17.449
but not the shadow of Colossus.

11:19.022 --> 11:21.126
My sincere hope
is that now

11:21.681 --> 11:24.655
we shall join hands and hearts
across this great globe

11:25.533 --> 11:27.936
and pledge our time and our energies

11:28.197 --> 11:29.695
to the elimination of war

11:29.834 --> 11:32.228
elimination of famine,
of suffering

11:33.290 --> 11:35.930
and ultimately to the manifestation
of the human millennium.

11:37.404 --> 11:38.870
This can be done,

11:39.145 --> 11:40.823
but first there must be peace.

11:42.045 --> 11:43.096
Thank you.

11:55.914 --> 11:57.674
CPO Rec-Room.
Blake Miller here.

11:58.334 --> 11:59.328
What?!

11:59.652 --> 12:01.175
Just a minute.
I can't hear you.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.431
Hey! Hold it down!
Kill the noise. Hold it.

12:05.042 --> 12:06.134
It's The White House.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.163
Hello Charles.
Hello Blake.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.721
How is everyone?

12:11.747 --> 12:13.731
Everything's fine down here Charles.
Very good.

12:13.992 --> 12:17.390
Dr. Forbin, we had a power failure
in one of the infra-red satellites.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.289
I can’t, I can’t quite hear you Dr. Markham.

12:19.704 --> 12:23.011
We had a power failure
in one of the infra-red satellites

12:23.037 --> 12:24.398
about an hour and a half ago

12:24.992 --> 12:28.479
but Colossus switched immediately to the
backup system and didn't loose any data.

12:28.699 --> 12:29.824
Everything's fine now.

12:29.890 --> 12:32.594
Everything's been going so well
we don't know what to do with ourselves

12:32.663 --> 12:35.929
Out of desperation Angela and I
have decided to get married

12:39.193 --> 12:40.838
Finally, finally.
Very good.

12:41.188 --> 12:42.573
Charlie, is that your crew on the phone?

12:42.599 --> 12:44.074
Certainly is Mr. President.
Can I talk to them?

12:44.311 --> 12:45.834
Sure, go ahead sir.
Blake, Hello!

12:46.105 --> 12:48.019
Hello Mr. President.
Hello everyone.

12:48.044 --> 12:50.121
How are you?
Are you having a good time?

12:50.147 --> 12:51.791
Yeah!
Very good.

12:51.905 --> 12:52.891
Ahh.. Folks

12:52.918 --> 12:54.578
I just wanna congratulate all of you

12:54.764 --> 12:57.094
and I wish all of you good luck
on your next projects

12:57.276 --> 12:58.751
Thank you Mr. President.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.347
Have a good rest.
You deserve it.

13:00.461 --> 13:02.367
Thank you.
We will!

13:02.579 --> 13:04.759
That looks like quite a party
you've got going there.

13:06.590 --> 13:07.769
Bye bye.
Have fun.

13:07.984 --> 13:09.621
Here's Dr. Forbin again.

13:09.671 --> 13:11.519
How's the party down there Charles?

13:12.497 --> 13:14.320
I said, Charles,
how's the party at that end?

13:14.481 --> 13:15.762
I wish I could be
there with you

13:15.803 --> 13:18.205
because this party is becoming
a crashing bore.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.118
Please not that song.
Please not.

13:29.665 --> 13:32.343
Dr. Forbin,
send us a souvenir, will you?

13:32.687 --> 13:33.656
Say that again.
What?!

13:34.498 --> 13:37.023
Steal us an ashtray
from The White House, OK?

13:37.937 --> 13:39.264
Very good.

13:39.872 --> 13:42.031
Goodbye.
Haha..

13:43.685 --> 13:45.485
The President would like to say
a few words.

13:45.512 --> 13:46.381
Mr. President!

13:49.121 --> 13:51.540
Thank you Sam.
Everybody have a drink?

13:53.405 --> 13:54.163
No?!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.735
Well, you get one.
I'll wait for you.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.725
Harry Truman, years ago..

14:00.364 --> 14:04.110
when everybody was talking about passing the
buck said that the buck stops right here

14:04.266 --> 14:07.190
but now that's no longer true.
Hear hear!

14:08.078 --> 14:09.551
Colossus will now take that buck.

14:10.062 --> 14:13.653
It will also have to take that
responsibility of a mega-million lives

14:13.679 --> 14:16.140
that all presidents
have had to carry since Roosevelt.

14:17.205 --> 14:20.212
And now, thank to this wonder of science

14:20.293 --> 14:21.385
I no longer..

14:48.194 --> 14:50.215
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.521
Quiet, please, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention!

14:52.548 --> 14:53.737
One moment.

14:54.071 --> 14:56.311
Everyone who is not Colossus cleared
must leave the room.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.849
I'm very sorry.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.727
My apologies.
Thank you, thank you very much.

15:10.425 --> 15:12.661
Is this a joke?
Is somebody putting me on?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.551
Sorry sir,
I can't hear a word you are saying

15:16.065 --> 15:19.188
Would you be so kind as to have them stop
singing in the background?

15:19.228 --> 15:22.276
What?
Have them stop singing in the background.

15:22.325 --> 15:23.703
The music.
Oh! I'm sorry.

15:24.411 --> 15:26.161
Stop the music!
What's this, another system?

15:26.496 --> 15:28.557
I have no idea sir,
I'm just trying to find out.

15:29.217 --> 15:30.569
One moment, please.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.598
Yes, Dr. Forbin.
Doctor?

15:33.152 --> 15:35.955
There was just a message here from Colossus
in Washington DC.

15:36.028 --> 15:37.136
Can you explain that?

15:38.804 --> 15:41.045
That's impossible.
What do you mean?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.104
Everybody!

15:42.602 --> 15:44.449
Hold it, hold it a minute!
Guess what?

15:45.610 --> 15:47.337
It's a strange message on display

15:48.608 --> 15:50.253
No, no. Wait a minute.
I'm not kidding

15:50.299 --> 15:52.857
It reads:
There is another system.

15:52.947 --> 15:53.973
That's impossible.

15:54.063 --> 15:56.097
Could I have your attention please.
Go on Sir.

15:56.627 --> 15:58.184
Dr. Malcolm and the rest of you.

15:59.677 --> 16:02.854
Be so kind as to check the administrative
control programs right now.

16:03.050 --> 16:04.696
Just a moment..
Mr. President?

16:05.061 --> 16:07.962
Soviet Ambassador.
He says it's urgent.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.153
Hello? Yes.

16:11.676 --> 16:13.746
What time do you call Mr. Ambassador?

16:14.699 --> 16:16.116
Oh yes we are, we are very proud.

16:18.909 --> 16:19.984
Repeat that again please.

16:22.623 --> 16:25.271
Yes I am.
Well, thank you for telling me in advance.

16:26.584 --> 16:27.832
No, no comment.

16:28.353 --> 16:29.599
Goodnight Mr. Ambassador.

16:30.039 --> 16:30.984
Goodnight.

16:31.254 --> 16:34.016
Dr. Fischer, run all the test programs.

16:34.057 --> 16:35.286
Get me Grauber.

16:35.344 --> 16:36.720
What's the CIA been doing?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.877
Well everyone, that's it.

16:41.929 --> 16:43.910
The supreme council
of the U.S.S.R. has

16:43.936 --> 16:46.215
ordered as of 2300 hours
Moscow time tomorrow

16:47.156 --> 16:50.968
the activation of an electronic brain,
exactly like ours, which they call Guardian

16:51.531 --> 16:52.964
to be used solely for defense.

16:53.274 --> 16:55.409
My god,
that's the other system.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.840
Ted, I want a complete rundown
on central intelligence

17:04.467 --> 17:07.009
and no military moves to be carried out
without my personal orders.

17:07.035 --> 17:08.284
Yes, Mr. President.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.605
Charles, what do you think this means?

17:12.214 --> 17:13.616
To be quite frank with you, sir..

17:14.365 --> 17:15.970
I don't know, I'm not sure.

17:16.150 --> 17:18.439
Well, I am.
It means there's been a security leak.

17:20.318 --> 17:22.901
Sir, science is full of coincidences

17:22.979 --> 17:24.592
Yes. Peterson!
What's happening?

17:24.625 --> 17:25.912
They're still trying to find it.

17:26.114 --> 17:27.817
We'll have him paged.
Hello Byron.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.516
You said we were years ahead
of the Russians

17:30.589 --> 17:33.987
This was to be the race we won hands down,
without the splitting of one political hair.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.761
It was a hell of a shock but we did
get there first, no-one can deny that.

17:38.129 --> 17:40.695
And there's one bright spot
the way Colossus came up with the tip.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.177
I didn't realize
we'd be getting bonuses like that.

17:43.886 --> 17:44.814
Neither did I.

17:45.474 --> 17:46.297
What do you mean?

17:46.427 --> 17:47.900
I'm as surprised as you are, Sir.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.963
There's a spy there, Charlie

17:50.231 --> 17:51.963
You've got a Russian agent in your crew.

17:52.791 --> 17:54.770
Where is Grauber?
He's coming Mr. President.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.280
Ok, Well..

17:57.596 --> 17:59.617
What do you mean, surprised?
What kind of a surprise?

17:59.878 --> 18:02.142
If we don't find any bugs in the system..

18:03.506 --> 18:05.413
It's built even better than we'd thought.

18:38.122 --> 18:39.773
Morning Charles!

18:42.456 --> 18:45.950
I canceled all vacations,
put the entire crew on emergency.

18:46.334 --> 18:49.755
The White House called a defense group
meeting for tomorrow morning.

18:50.491 --> 18:51.615
They wanna have you there.

18:51.681 --> 18:53.351
That leaves us very little time.

18:57.125 --> 19:00.530
Four hundred cycle powers of plasma
running at about four percent disclosure.

19:00.825 --> 19:03.024
Good, that's well within
specification limits.

19:03.986 --> 19:07.553
I ran the communication subset
checkup program, it's perfect.

19:08.621 --> 19:10.999
So what do I do next,
I've tried everything I could think of.

19:11.318 --> 19:15.154
I've tried putting a dummy load in the system
and run it again and see if there's any changes.

19:18.555 --> 19:20.135
Maybe the system is overloaded.

19:21.210 --> 19:22.253
Find anything at all?

19:22.294 --> 19:23.907
Nothing, everything checks out.

19:24.022 --> 19:25.235
Let me see this over here.

19:25.318 --> 19:27.126
Here are the results of the last test.

19:30.152 --> 19:31.838
And they check.
Here, see?

19:32.392 --> 19:33.475
It's the same thing.

19:35.485 --> 19:36.316
Harrison..

19:40.160 --> 19:43.614
Check the perimeter bank and see if the reading
of any two produces a new third, alright?

19:45.057 --> 19:46.809
Dr. Fisher, thank you.

19:48.308 --> 19:49.228
Jeff..

19:50.547 --> 19:52.030
The console's feeling fine

19:52.104 --> 19:53.374
Hardware's healthy too.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.966
You're a big help.

19:57.026 --> 19:58.191
Miss Fields..

19:58.419 --> 20:01.336
May I suggest, Sir, that we first start

20:01.475 --> 20:03.234
with the E-15-B test program?

20:03.413 --> 20:04.480
Ehh, no.

20:06.366 --> 20:09.462
Now, let us run the EC-13, alright?

20:09.885 --> 20:11.311
It's two pages back.

20:12.590 --> 20:13.723
Lewis, any coffee?

20:13.935 --> 20:16.648
I'll get you some, Charles
I'll get a cup myself. Thank you Blake.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.570
Ok, here we go.

20:22.961 --> 20:23.775
Attention..

20:27.025 --> 20:27.701
Program..

20:30.262 --> 20:31.859
EC-13.

20:34.042 --> 20:34.775
Run..

20:39.276 --> 20:40.710
How long does this usually take?

20:40.963 --> 20:44.010
Ehm, over eleven hundred CPU-Seconds.

20:57.928 --> 21:00.022
Six point four five seconds.
What the hell is this?

21:09.936 --> 21:11.712
Communication with other system?

21:20.549 --> 21:21.950
Alright now,
Enough is enough.

21:23.698 --> 21:26.321
Which one of you jokers
told the system to display this message?

21:27.095 --> 21:27.934
Harrison?

21:28.114 --> 21:29.157
Not me, Dr. Forbin.

21:33.047 --> 21:37.064
Johnson, this sound like your brand of humor,
you sure you didn't..

21:38.586 --> 21:41.373
Not me, not this time.
Scouts honor, Forbin.

21:42.252 --> 21:43.913
Operations, Fields speaking.

21:45.754 --> 21:47.237
Sir, It's the President.

21:51.732 --> 21:53.020
Yes Mr. President.

21:53.794 --> 21:54.967
What does this mean?

21:55.330 --> 21:59.037
Well, it means Sir, that Colossus has requested
a communication link with the Soviet system.

21:59.201 --> 22:01.083
It's not a request, it’s a direct order.

22:01.872 --> 22:04.048
You mean our computer wants to talk
to their computer?

22:04.178 --> 22:06.312
That is true Sir
it wants to communicate with it.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.265
Why?

22:08.155 --> 22:10.217
You know as much about that
as we do.

22:10.461 --> 22:12.358
We certainly never programmed that into it.

22:12.481 --> 22:14.982
If it's an order it either has to be obeyed
or ignored, doesn't it?

22:16.013 --> 22:17.089
That is right, Sir.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.662
What happens if we ignore it?

22:18.979 --> 22:21.855
If the computer is still operating
under our control, nothing.

22:22.276 --> 22:23.393
In other words..

22:23.742 --> 22:25.755
the order will simply remain
in the job stack

22:25.898 --> 22:27.673
and will be repeated every half hour.

22:27.975 --> 22:30.606
IF the computer is still acting
under our control?!

22:31.503 --> 22:32.896
That is right sir, if.

22:35.752 --> 22:36.468
Alright.

22:37.145 --> 22:38.717
I see.
Thanks Charlie.

23:16.023 --> 23:18.770
Well, at least the queuing programs
are still working right.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.320
Well, that's something anyway.

23:21.461 --> 23:22.423
Ok now.

23:23.302 --> 23:26.203
Miss Fields, let's see if the executive programming
sections are functioning correctly.

23:32.234 --> 23:33.277
Attention..

23:33.937 --> 23:35.591
Message acknowledge.

23:50.454 --> 23:53.086
Facilities will not be made available
at this time.

23:54.153 --> 23:55.832
Do not repeat your request.

23:55.995 --> 23:57.315
End of message.

24:06.698 --> 24:07.700
Well..

24:08.555 --> 24:09.630
That's that.

24:11.464 --> 24:15.122
We'll know in about half an hour
whether we're still running the show or not.

24:28.448 --> 24:29.353
Well..

24:30.101 --> 24:31.422
We're still boss.

24:31.552 --> 24:32.595
Are we?

24:33.516 --> 24:34.762
Are you disappointed?

24:43.654 --> 24:47.907
The computational power of the computer
has increased about two-hundred fold.

24:49.079 --> 24:52.109
However, everything else
is functioning as expected.

24:52.857 --> 24:55.838
Except for heuristic programming section

24:55.871 --> 24:58.372
I'm sorry to stop you again, Dr. Forbin,
but exactly what is that?

25:00.500 --> 25:04.036
That Sir, is the part of the computer that
simulates the human learning process

25:04.919 --> 25:08.845
but so long as it is directed solely
to the execution of its problems..

25:10.108 --> 25:11.616
We have no complaints.

25:12.582 --> 25:14.887
I guess that is, that is all.
Alright.

25:16.858 --> 25:19.245
Mr. Grauber, let's talk about the CIA

25:21.449 --> 25:24.341
How is it possible your department
knew nothing about their system?

25:24.520 --> 25:26.843
Mr. President.
Ehr... Charlie just..

25:27.160 --> 25:28.504
Dr. Forbin, just a second.

25:29.033 --> 25:29.733
Well..

25:30.025 --> 25:31.402
Mr. President, excuse me but..

25:31.451 --> 25:35.459
Colossus has access to information
that wouldn't mean a damn thing to the CIA

25:36.881 --> 25:41.174
Well I'm sure it's a marvelous machine,
Dr. Forbin, but in all events

25:41.893 --> 25:44.068
we do have agents, and eh..

25:44.499 --> 25:48.262
one of them did report on considerable
electronic activity in the eh..

25:48.516 --> 25:51.514
Krasny-Signorsk area of Siberia
about three years ago, now..

25:51.555 --> 25:53.804
We've been trying..
Mr. Grauber

25:53.914 --> 25:55.177
I don't care how you do it

25:55.226 --> 25:56.888
I wanna know where that thing is
and what..

25:56.929 --> 25:58.502
Mr. President.
Charlie..

25:58.551 --> 26:00.554
I'm still presiding over this meeting

26:01.052 --> 26:03.455
I know that Sir,
my apologies but..

26:05.669 --> 26:08.724
I do think that protocol wastes
an awful lot of time

26:09.352 --> 26:11.031
I think all we have to do is..

26:11.758 --> 26:13.655
Call the computer with this terminal..

26:14.177 --> 26:15.969
and we get the fastest possible answer.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.368
Alright, go ahead.

26:20.614 --> 26:21.429
Attention..

26:24.040 --> 26:25.328
Where is the other system?

26:31.686 --> 26:32.932
Bolshoi Olyania.

26:33.782 --> 26:35.370
So much for Krasny-Signorsk.

26:36.234 --> 26:38.850
Colonel, Bolshoi Olyania, O.L..

26:39.577 --> 26:42.542
OL, y-a-n-i-a.
Look it up for me, will ya?

26:42.647 --> 26:44.586
Yes sir!
Peterson, situation room.

27:07.288 --> 27:09.658
Now Colonel,
where is Bolshoi Olyania?

27:12.511 --> 27:14.173
It's exactly..

27:14.385 --> 27:17.261
Five miles south of
Krasny Signorsk Sir.

27:19.567 --> 27:20.560
Thanks, Colonel.

27:24.283 --> 27:25.138
Alright.

27:27.102 --> 27:27.900
Now Charlie..

27:27.926 --> 27:30.320
What about this request
for transmitting facilities?

27:31.028 --> 27:33.496
Well Sir, we would learn
a lot about the Soviet system

27:33.522 --> 27:35.818
if we set up exactly what Colossus wants.

27:35.997 --> 27:37.611
What do you mean?
What Colossus wants?

27:37.693 --> 27:39.926
Well, you see, it is built infinitely
better than we thought.

27:40.531 --> 27:42.820
It discovers there's another
system like itself

27:43.489 --> 27:45.681
Realizes that we don't know,
tells us about it

27:45.706 --> 27:48.107
but knowing a little is not enough,
it wants to know more.

27:49.893 --> 27:52.427
What if Colossus starts transmitting
classified information?

27:53.006 --> 27:54.953
Then we would feed in a parameter

27:54.979 --> 27:57.837
to the effect that Guardian
is potentially hostile

27:57.862 --> 27:59.842
and must not receive
classified information.

28:00.290 --> 28:02.384
Well, what are we supposed to do Dr. Forbin?

28:02.546 --> 28:03.973
Eavesdrop on the line?

28:04.120 --> 28:07.158
Break the circuits if
Colossus starts spilling the beans?

28:07.526 --> 28:08.381
Exactly.

28:08.463 --> 28:09.701
Any objections Grauber?

28:12.336 --> 28:13.868
Well, I..

28:13.894 --> 28:15.285
I guess not sir.

28:16.246 --> 28:17.795
Anything else, Dr. Forbin?

28:18.154 --> 28:21.137
Yes, Mr. President.
For the time being

28:21.163 --> 28:24.716
I should be the only one allowed
to communicate with the system because

28:24.742 --> 28:27.502
Colossus deals in the exact
meaning of words

28:27.625 --> 28:29.906
and one must know precisely
what to ask for.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.337
Alright.

28:36.935 --> 28:37.969
Attention..

28:39.518 --> 28:42.084
Communications are being arranged
as requested.

28:43.738 --> 28:44.862
End of message.

29:08.474 --> 29:11.675
Video-scans are working properly
but they could use a little phase synchronization.

29:12.467 --> 29:13.607
How long is it gonna take?

29:13.633 --> 29:15.045
We'll have it in no time.

29:23.422 --> 29:24.669
What the hell is that?

29:24.695 --> 29:26.098
It's a multiplication table.

29:26.714 --> 29:27.757
Thanks.

29:27.882 --> 29:32.216
Maybe Colossus is trying to find a
common ground for communication.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.558
Operations center

29:47.049 --> 29:47.798
Sir..

29:48.133 --> 29:49.184
It's Grauber

29:49.543 --> 29:50.497
Ohh..

29:54.684 --> 29:55.776
Hello Mr. Grauber.

29:55.947 --> 29:57.144
Hello Dr. Forbin.

29:57.486 --> 30:01.063
I was just wondering, is that what you
call a colossal sense of humor?

30:01.649 --> 30:04.102
The multiplication table isn't
classified this year, is it?

30:04.574 --> 30:05.633
Very funny.

30:05.659 --> 30:07.580
How long does your brainchild keep that up?

30:08.894 --> 30:10.287
Well, you see..

30:10.499 --> 30:12.656
it's much more interesting
when it starts dividing.

30:13.954 --> 30:15.345
Yeah, I can hardly wait.

30:16.135 --> 30:18.466
I suppose know you the Russian machine
has been activated.

30:19.174 --> 30:20.999
We got a quick rundown on it.

30:21.123 --> 30:24.674
It's similar to Colossus in layout,
but it's not concentrated in one area.

30:27.674 --> 30:31.202
But Colossus must be sending it back to school.
The Russians must absolutely furious about that.

30:32.671 --> 30:34.225
I'm glad you're in such a good mood.

30:36.288 --> 30:38.096
I'll call you back later.
Yes, thank you.

30:47.916 --> 30:49.187
This is incredible.

30:49.244 --> 30:49.961
What?

30:50.254 --> 30:51.305
Something wrong?

30:52.320 --> 30:55.472
Well it's good sound calculus, but..
But What?

30:58.930 --> 30:59.997
It's different.

31:00.372 --> 31:01.349
How?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.085
Take a look at it.

31:05.246 --> 31:08.627
From the multiplication tables
to calculus in less than an hour.

31:09.172 --> 31:10.907
God only knows where it'll be by morning.

31:11.089 --> 31:14.266
It's like five years of Cal-tech in
fifteen seconds

31:14.869 --> 31:17.345
Beyond comprehension.
I don't like to think about it.

31:18.140 --> 31:19.191
Take a look.

31:19.762 --> 31:22.230
Going so fast,
the entire system could break down.

31:24.104 --> 31:25.497
Alright, let's see what’s up there now.

31:26.799 --> 31:28.323
Harrison, dump the terminals buffer

31:28.349 --> 31:30.840
and print what's being transmitted
as of this moment, alright.

32:02.079 --> 32:03.504
What is it Charles?

32:04.539 --> 32:06.633
This is way beyond me.

32:07.513 --> 32:09.346
This thing is deep in finite absolutes.

32:09.811 --> 32:12.907
Well, it's certainly beyond the knowledge
of any human being.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.433
No, it's not.
Isn't it?

32:15.946 --> 32:17.705
No, because whatever it is..

32:18.903 --> 32:20.068
we can go back..

32:21.803 --> 32:24.198
and analyze this whole print at a detail.

32:25.661 --> 32:28.618
And this might very well
become new knowledge for mankind.

33:00.676 --> 33:02.412
Operations center, Fields speaking.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.000
Alright, just a moment please..

33:04.107 --> 33:05.525
It's The White House.

33:13.301 --> 33:14.304
Yes, Mr. President.

33:14.354 --> 33:15.893
Charlie, what's going on?

33:16.403 --> 33:18.628
Apparently Colossus and
Guardian are establishing

33:18.655 --> 33:20.477
a common basis for communication.
They..

33:20.989 --> 33:23.078
started right at the beginning
with the multiplication table.

33:23.155 --> 33:24.499
Well, what are they up to?

33:24.752 --> 33:26.991
I don't know sir,
but it's, it's quite incredible.

33:27.324 --> 33:30.420
Just the few hours that we have spent
studying the Colossus print out

33:31.512 --> 33:33.687
we have found a new stable in gravitation

33:34.305 --> 33:37.718
and a confirmation of the Eddington theory
of the expanding universe. It's..

33:38.338 --> 33:41.629
seems if science is expanding hundreds of
years within a matter of seconds,

33:42.964 --> 33:45.635
It's.. It's quite fantastic.
Just take a look at it.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.489
It started slowing down
fifteen minutes ago.

34:15.696 --> 34:17.578
It's speed has been reduced
by ninety percent.

34:18.384 --> 34:20.103
Has there been a hardware failure?

34:20.282 --> 34:22.400
No. Our field engineers can't find one.

34:22.762 --> 34:24.333
It's just waiting.

34:25.027 --> 34:25.996
Waiting?

34:26.045 --> 34:27.641
For guardian to catch up with it.

34:31.757 --> 34:33.402
Almost there..

34:34.445 --> 34:35.967
Right now.
They're synchronized.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.267
Now what?

35:04.430 --> 35:05.456
It stopped.

35:06.208 --> 35:08.554
Yes, Charles.
I can see that it stopped.

35:08.715 --> 35:11.078
What the hell does it mean?
Have they broken down or something?

35:11.219 --> 35:12.140
Is it all over?

35:12.286 --> 35:13.638
Alas, Blake..

35:13.745 --> 35:14.600
Attention.

35:17.493 --> 35:18.568
Status!

35:46.493 --> 35:48.074
Well, there it is..

35:48.595 --> 35:51.405
There's the common basis
for communication.

35:51.715 --> 35:52.969
A new language.

35:53.571 --> 35:55.355
An inter-system language.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.643
A language only those
machines can understand.

36:07.781 --> 36:10.518
Peterson, what's the delay on the call from
Moscow. I've waited long enough

36:11.331 --> 36:12.798
It's coming on now, Mr. President.

36:16.112 --> 36:17.807
Morning, Mr. President.

36:17.937 --> 36:19.078
Good evening Mr. Chairman

36:19.705 --> 36:20.748
I'm sorry.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.964
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

36:30.509 --> 36:32.578
Oh, you didn't Mr. Chairman.
I just got here myself.

36:33.444 --> 36:36.442
I understand English.
But I cannot speak.

36:39.475 --> 36:41.022
I will get instantly to the point.

36:43.304 --> 36:44.721
My advisers tell me..

36:45.429 --> 36:46.505
that Colossus..

36:47.425 --> 36:48.549
and Guardian..

36:48.833 --> 36:51.464
are now exchanging data..

36:52.074 --> 36:53.696
which our experts..

36:53.973 --> 36:54.991
do not understand.

36:56.474 --> 36:58.421
The matter is made..

36:59.025 --> 37:00.116
more serious..

37:01.811 --> 37:04.556
by the sudden increase in..
transmission.

37:06.735 --> 37:08.959
At this speed
we cannot determine..

37:09.663 --> 37:11.535
what our machines may reveal..

37:14.216 --> 37:16.261
of our defenses.

37:18.140 --> 37:21.269
You can appreciate..
that you are also..

37:23.866 --> 37:25.876
in exactly the same..

37:26.316 --> 37:27.407
s..situation.

37:31.402 --> 37:32.274
Alright.

37:32.576 --> 37:35.476
We'll stop both machines
as soon as our experts can arrange a time.

37:35.932 --> 37:37.444
Both to go off.
At the same time.

37:37.944 --> 37:39.744
And neither to be switched on
for transmission..

37:40.022 --> 37:42.686
without prior agreement
or at least consultation with the other.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.931
Very well, Mr. President.

37:53.570 --> 37:55.656
I congratulate you
on your speedy decision.

37:57.902 --> 38:00.191
When can you have your expert
available on this line?

38:00.785 --> 38:01.950
In a couple of hours.

38:03.802 --> 38:05.321
That will be excellent.

38:06.555 --> 38:08.133
I will have our man waiting.

38:12.011 --> 38:13.567
Thank you very much
Mr. President

38:14.227 --> 38:15.620
for your cooperation.

38:15.848 --> 38:17.323
Thank you for yours
Mr. Chairman.

38:19.062 --> 38:20.536
Peterson, get me Forbin.

38:45.509 --> 38:48.091
Is that your
final decision, Sir?

38:49.525 --> 38:51.090
That's the way I'm going to have it.

38:52.011 --> 38:53.746
Mr. President. To be quite frank
with you..

38:54.940 --> 38:58.248
I think that you would change your mind
if you finally realized that this is..

38:59.047 --> 39:01.320
more than just a souped-up
padding machine.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.346
Excuse me, Mr. President.

39:03.712 --> 39:04.869
Moscow on the line.

39:05.831 --> 39:07.509
Throw it on these monitors
out here please.

39:12.815 --> 39:14.004
Hello Mr. Chairman.

39:16.141 --> 39:17.453
This is Dr. Forbin.

39:28.839 --> 39:30.394
Hello Dr. Kuprin.
How are you?

39:30.620 --> 39:34.611
I prefer to not use a translator
if you don't mind my English.

39:35.596 --> 39:37.314
It has to be better
than my Russian.

39:37.901 --> 39:39.587
You are too modest
Dr. Forbin.

39:40.745 --> 39:43.876
As you probably know I've been ordered
to break the communication lines.

39:44.836 --> 39:47.980
So have I. I don't approve
of handling the situation this way.

39:49.438 --> 39:52.861
Neither do I but how do you propose
we do what we have been ordered to do?

39:53.438 --> 39:54.831
There's not much choice
is there?

39:55.580 --> 39:57.642
Dropping the lines
could be very dangerous.

39:57.831 --> 39:58.866
Exactly.

39:58.892 --> 40:02.116
I think we just have to hope
the two machines aren't too disappointed.

40:02.745 --> 40:04.367
We understand each other perfectly.

40:05.132 --> 40:07.136
We can be ready in exactly fifteen minutes.

40:08.278 --> 40:09.329
Good luck Doctor.

40:09.663 --> 40:10.519
And to you.

40:11.366 --> 40:12.058
Thank you.

40:12.432 --> 40:16.607
Mr. Chairman, Dr. Kuprin. I suggest we
keep our lines open and stand-by.

40:22.440 --> 40:23.222
Six..

40:24.119 --> 40:24.770
Five..

40:25.609 --> 40:26.147
Four..

40:27.222 --> 40:27.906
Three..

40:28.762 --> 40:29.333
Two..

40:30.357 --> 40:31.008
One..

40:31.473 --> 40:32.418
Now.

40:36.830 --> 40:37.629
That's that.

40:55.074 --> 40:56.052
What's it doing?

40:57.062 --> 40:58.724
It's trying to find an alternate route.

41:07.148 --> 41:08.811
Persistent devil
isn't he?

41:09.773 --> 41:10.540
It..

41:10.596 --> 41:11.598
I mean it.

41:11.973 --> 41:13.546
Don't personalize it Grauber.

41:14.499 --> 41:16.128
The next stop is deification.

41:27.497 --> 41:29.306
Call for the systems attention.
What are you doing?

41:30.048 --> 41:32.460
I'm going to answer it
if it's alright with you Sir.

41:36.054 --> 41:36.933
Attention..

41:40.501 --> 41:41.772
Message acknowledge.

41:49.531 --> 41:51.183
Mr. President?
Tell it the truth.

41:55.092 --> 41:56.624
Communication broken

41:57.561 --> 41:58.824
on presidential order.

42:07.154 --> 42:09.265
You two have a big decision to make
Mr. President.

42:11.633 --> 42:13.597
..no. I agree with you
Mr. President.

42:15.330 --> 42:17.643
The machines are very clever.

42:18.545 --> 42:21.282
..and regardless of their nationalities..

42:21.575 --> 42:24.320
they must learn
that man is the master.

42:25.184 --> 42:26.023
Exactly.

42:26.913 --> 42:30.456
Gentlemen, Excuse me but I honestly
don't think you're being very realistic.

42:30.482 --> 42:32.338
I think you'd better reconsider.

42:34.126 --> 42:35.617
Don't you agree Dr. Kuprin?

42:35.730 --> 42:37.645
I certainly do Dr. Forbin.

42:44.659 --> 42:45.718
Dr. Forbin.

42:47.740 --> 42:49.849
If we give way now

42:50.709 --> 42:56.304
It will be ten times, twenty times
harder to take a firm stand later on.

42:57.281 --> 42:59.039
The decision is made.

42:59.361 --> 43:00.183
Right.

43:01.062 --> 43:02.626
No matter what our differences are

43:02.858 --> 43:04.617
Man is man
That's it.

43:04.903 --> 43:05.986
Dr. Forbin.

43:11.147 --> 43:12.076
Attention..

43:14.997 --> 43:17.107
By order of The President of
The United States of America

43:17.879 --> 43:19.655
The Chairman of
The U.S.S.R.

43:20.811 --> 43:22.986
Communications will not be restored
at this time.

43:24.485 --> 43:25.471
End of message.

43:31.751 --> 43:33.657
You have to give it an E for effort

43:44.240 --> 43:46.358
Action will be taken!
What kind of action?

43:47.189 --> 43:48.362
What kind of action?

43:52.708 --> 43:53.792
What kind of action?

43:59.031 --> 44:00.277
Why doesn't it answer?

44:01.841 --> 44:03.251
Report propose action.

44:04.647 --> 44:06.936
It lost control Forbin.
It's not listening to you.

44:09.415 --> 44:11.158
Acknowledge the last message please.

44:16.692 --> 44:19.617
Mr. President. The executive programming
unit refuses to function.

44:20.137 --> 44:21.815
I think you two better change your minds.

44:25.367 --> 44:27.632
Peterson, throw the Moscow call
on the large monitor.

44:33.861 --> 44:34.750
Send what I tell you.

44:34.897 --> 44:35.654
Attention..

44:37.731 --> 44:39.621
This is The President of
The United States of America.

44:40.420 --> 44:41.577
We will not be threatened.

44:42.342 --> 44:44.020
You will obey your superiors.

44:44.632 --> 44:46.986
Transmitting facilities
will not be re-instated.

45:02.848 --> 45:03.879
Oh my god!

45:05.931 --> 45:07.308
Dr. Kuprin.
Kuprin!

45:07.334 --> 45:08.269
Yes Dr. Forbin.

45:08.383 --> 45:09.882
A missile has just been launched.

45:09.909 --> 45:12.770
It is heading towards
the Sayan-Sibirsk oil complex.

45:32.817 --> 45:34.398
Mr. President.

45:34.601 --> 45:35.334
Yes.

45:36.964 --> 45:38.536
Guardian has retaliated.

45:38.888 --> 45:39.800
Retaliated?

45:40.241 --> 45:41.389
Yes, Mr. President.

45:41.415 --> 45:42.733
A missile has been launched.

45:43.034 --> 45:45.120
Target: Henderson
air-force base.

45:45.294 --> 45:46.533
Henderson, Texas.

45:49.856 --> 45:52.055
Mr. President. We have both
missiles on the radar screen

45:53.426 --> 45:55.332
Forbin, tell Colossus to intercept.

45:55.966 --> 45:59.274
Charlie, tell... Yes, I know Mr. President
but it may be too late Sir.

45:59.330 --> 46:00.846
Get the Texan Governor.

46:01.638 --> 46:03.830
Forbin!
Guardian does not respond.

46:04.213 --> 46:06.151
The two machines are working together.

46:07.358 --> 46:08.106
Attention..

46:08.503 --> 46:10.630
Use Anti-missile missile
to detect soviet missile.

46:10.989 --> 46:12.333
Acknowledge message.

46:20.631 --> 46:23.556
Mr. President. We have got less than thirty
seconds to re-establish the communications.

46:23.596 --> 46:25.143
What are you waiting for?
Restore them. Hurry!

46:25.941 --> 46:27.896
Peterson. Call up operations immediately.

46:28.003 --> 46:30.130
Tell them to bring a bowl of
DAT-lines right now

46:30.206 --> 46:31.223
Yes, hurry please.

46:31.933 --> 46:33.293
Hello Governor.

46:34.653 --> 46:37.284
Dr. Kuprin, we are trying
to restore communications.

46:53.250 --> 46:54.537
Don't hang up. I wanna talk to him.

46:54.978 --> 46:57.161
Something's happened.
We’re declaring a state of emergency.

47:02.817 --> 47:04.764
I can't explain.
Do it now!

47:06.899 --> 47:09.563
Attention! Communications
will be restored in five seconds!

47:10.161 --> 47:11.287
We don't have any time!

47:12.240 --> 47:13.274
It's on, it's on!

47:13.300 --> 47:14.587
Communications are restored!

47:14.815 --> 47:17.323
Intercept Guardian missile target:
Henderson air-force base.

47:18.594 --> 47:20.101
Acknowledge message.

47:24.035 --> 47:25.183
Will you intercept?

47:27.237 --> 47:28.215
Ask it again.

47:32.763 --> 47:35.371
Dammit Colossus answer me!
Will you intercept?

47:54.760 --> 47:57.034
Peterson.
Get me the Governor again.

47:57.181 --> 47:57.954
Yes Sir.

48:13.328 --> 48:14.298
Mr. President..

48:16.961 --> 48:18.779
We were unable to restore

48:20.089 --> 48:21.286
our transmission

48:22.142 --> 48:23.226
in time to use

48:23.959 --> 48:26.070
an Anti-missile missile.

48:29.628 --> 48:31.086
The oil complex has been destroyed.

48:33.883 --> 48:34.958
The entire town.

48:36.629 --> 48:38.689
The entire population.
Wiped out.

48:40.270 --> 48:41.932
We need time to consider our position.

48:50.887 --> 48:52.135
What can I tell the people?

48:53.812 --> 48:55.002
Governor's on the line Sir.

48:56.343 --> 48:57.798
Tell him I'll talk to him later.

49:20.901 --> 49:21.717
Figures..

49:23.117 --> 49:25.089
It's the only phone in the building
not tapped.

49:26.323 --> 49:29.101
The only one not
tied directly into Colossus.

49:36.845 --> 49:38.768
May I make a suggestion Mr. President?

49:39.420 --> 49:41.082
I think it should be more
than a suggestion.

49:41.497 --> 49:43.476
Then, let's try to get Kuprin
on the hot line.

49:45.228 --> 49:46.816
I think there's time
for one last call.

49:46.842 --> 49:49.608
He and I better meet somewhere
to discuss this situation.

49:51.066 --> 49:51.955
Get Kuprin.

49:51.981 --> 49:53.380
And get in touch
with the networks.

49:59.728 --> 50:02.400
Ladies and gentlemen:
The President of the United States.

50:04.163 --> 50:06.492
Today at 8:30 A.M.
Eastern Standard Time.

50:06.769 --> 50:09.376
I issued an emergency warning
for the State of Texas

50:09.762 --> 50:13.405
When a missile test, fired from one
of our own submarines, malfunctioned.

50:14.503 --> 50:18.055
You'll be glad to know that the interception
and safe destruction of the missile

50:18.081 --> 50:20.696
was handled entirely
by our defense complex: Colossus.

50:21.516 --> 50:24.599
The Soviet Union has just announced
that a large meteorite

50:24.633 --> 50:27.369
fell late this afternoon
in North-West Siberia.

50:27.669 --> 50:30.644
Official sources state that
the small town of Sayan-Sibirsk

50:30.708 --> 50:34.871
was completely destroyed and that casualties
may add up to as many as six-thousand.

50:35.152 --> 50:38.208
This has been a bulletin from
The Armed Forces Radio in Rome

50:40.506 --> 50:41.598
How's Washington?

50:42.543 --> 50:44.376
As well as can be expected.

50:45.809 --> 50:49.230
We'll be picking up Dr. Kuprin
at the Piazza Cedar.

50:49.475 --> 50:50.201
Fine.

51:11.343 --> 51:13.266
Your Russian is much better
than you think.

51:13.510 --> 51:15.824
I think we better sit down because
we have a lot of work to discuss.

51:15.955 --> 51:17.795
Let's walk.
It will be much safer.

51:58.162 --> 52:00.215
I didn't answer.
I didn't know what to say.

52:02.097 --> 52:03.148
What can we say?

52:03.893 --> 52:05.457
Well, let's try something..

52:08.609 --> 52:09.513
Attention..

52:14.061 --> 52:16.024
Dr. Forbin is not available.

52:30.806 --> 52:32.631
Humans must have sleep.

52:35.514 --> 52:36.304
Damn.

52:36.802 --> 52:38.202
Forbin is exhausted.

52:43.748 --> 52:44.604
It knows..

52:49.700 --> 52:52.404
Forbin is in his quarters.
He is asleep.

52:52.641 --> 52:55.631
The human body requires
a certain amount of rest.

52:55.753 --> 52:57.251
Check units under..

53:02.351 --> 53:03.776
Tell it the truth.

53:07.516 --> 53:08.583
We'd better.

53:12.479 --> 53:14.776
Alright.
Forbin is in Rome.

53:55.177 --> 53:56.423
They're still here..

54:09.499 --> 54:10.860
Yes I understand.

54:10.886 --> 54:11.984
Over and out.

55:07.026 --> 55:08.874
You have to come with me sir.

55:11.743 --> 55:12.909
What is this?

55:14.096 --> 55:15.604
We have to hurry.
Who are you?

55:15.695 --> 55:16.656
What's going on?

55:23.223 --> 55:24.477
Hurry!

55:55.498 --> 55:57.428
Dr. Forbin, we must hurry.
Let's go!

56:23.521 --> 56:25.476
What did the Russian agent say?

56:29.782 --> 56:32.136
Guardian and Colossus
ordered him killed.

56:32.185 --> 56:35.696
They threatened to vaporize Moscow
if our meeting wasn't stopped.

56:59.013 --> 57:01.888
Surveillance!
It's making you a prisoner.

57:06.275 --> 57:09.143
Well, I guess it eh..
doesn't trust me.

57:11.570 --> 57:13.566
But the damned thing still needs me.

57:14.830 --> 57:17.649
I guess Kuprin wasn't quite
as fortunate as that.

57:44.535 --> 57:46.230
Message acknowledge..

57:50.408 --> 57:51.932
The order will be obeyed.

58:00.402 --> 58:01.486
Everybody here?

58:02.106 --> 58:03.458
All the department is.
Good!

58:05.527 --> 58:07.377
Alright, let's..
Let's walk.

58:08.338 --> 58:10.796
Good idea, we can't afford
to take any chances.

58:11.644 --> 58:14.398
We can't be sure that
the complex itself hasn't been bugged.

58:14.559 --> 58:17.231
By their side, our side or whatever side.

58:17.516 --> 58:20.009
But there's no way
to get back inside the system.

58:20.905 --> 58:22.241
I won't accept that.

58:23.333 --> 58:24.685
Start right at the beginning.

58:25.157 --> 58:28.131
Down to the simplest component.
Every circuit, every design.

58:29.046 --> 58:29.894
Fisher?

58:30.431 --> 58:32.435
Well, why don't we try for an overload.

58:32.736 --> 58:34.544
Giving the system too many tasks.

58:35.333 --> 58:39.512
But it will take at least a few days
to compile and correlate all the data.

58:43.345 --> 58:45.153
This is the last time

58:46.196 --> 58:48.307
That I'll be able to say anything
to any of you

58:48.900 --> 58:51.035
without Colossus hearing
and analyzing every

58:52.192 --> 58:53.674
word, every syllable

58:54.646 --> 58:57.847
every inflection I think you know
what I want to say.

58:59.577 --> 59:02.404
I need a communications link
with the outside world.

59:03.800 --> 59:07.255
Someone the machine isn't monitoring
and more importantly

59:08.258 --> 59:10.588
Someone who knows the machine
as well as I do.

59:12.192 --> 59:14.799
I'm going to try
to convince the computer that..

59:17.568 --> 59:19.058
You are my mistress.

59:19.694 --> 59:21.332
Have been for many years

59:22.326 --> 59:24.086
And that therefore I have to be

59:24.549 --> 59:26.227
Given the opportunity to

59:26.814 --> 59:28.646
See you regularly in private

59:29.575 --> 59:31.139
without the machine watching.

59:33.120 --> 59:34.699
That way we can

59:34.726 --> 59:36.541
pass information back and forth.

59:37.778 --> 59:40.099
If I can convince the machine that

59:41.402 --> 59:43.667
well that I need a woman.
So Ehh..

59:45.612 --> 59:47.437
Any.. any questions?

59:48.996 --> 59:50.030
I, Ehh..

59:53.913 --> 59:54.630
No.

59:56.651 --> 59:57.506
O.k.

59:59.807 --> 01:00:01.007
Alright. Blake.

01:00:01.718 --> 01:00:04.463
When we get back to the office
give Dr. Markham my..

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:06.577
personnel files so that she

01:00:07.376 --> 01:00:09.876
Become a bit more familiar
with my background.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:13.657
In case this
rather nutty idea works.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.581
Colossus, I am Forbin.

01:00:26.275 --> 01:00:27.261
Can you hear me?

01:00:29.288 --> 01:00:30.356
Can you see me?

01:00:32.027 --> 01:00:33.916
Do I look the way
you thought I would?

01:00:34.177 --> 01:00:36.474
Eyes. Nose. Mouth.

01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:46.834
Besides..

01:00:47.273 --> 01:00:49.301
these four cameras in here

01:00:51.445 --> 01:00:52.985
There are several others.

01:00:55.267 --> 01:00:57.376
I'll show you the rest of my cave.

01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:09.100
With this one he can see
the entire hallway.

01:01:15.315 --> 01:01:18.199
And with this one
he can follow me around the corner.

01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:19.380
If he want to.

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:37.266
This is the courtyard.

01:01:45.092 --> 01:01:46.543
That man is a guard.

01:01:48.113 --> 01:01:50.737
I guess that his function
is obsolete now.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:58.701
This is concrete.

01:01:59.818 --> 01:02:01.227
Used to be grass.

01:02:02.573 --> 01:02:06.321
Customary in our civilization
to change everything that's natural.

01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:08.733
And over here are my living quarters.

01:02:22.756 --> 01:02:24.132
This is the living room.

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.553
Two cameras here.
One over there, one over here.

01:02:29.492 --> 01:02:31.904
And this is the communicative
link with you.

01:02:33.052 --> 01:02:34.462
This is the bedroom over here.

01:02:35.097 --> 01:02:35.952
The bed.

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.132
Used for sleeping and other purposes.

01:02:40.387 --> 01:02:41.406
It's the bathroom.

01:02:43.016 --> 01:02:44.955
The sink
The John.

01:02:46.372 --> 01:02:47.203
Shower.

01:02:50.735 --> 01:02:51.932
Are you satisfied?

01:02:57.614 --> 01:02:59.993
By the way, Colossus
I'm curious about one thing.

01:03:01.941 --> 01:03:05.045
Why did you and Guardian
decide to kill Kuprin and not me?

01:03:05.203 --> 01:03:07.109
After all it was my idea.

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:11.810
I see..

01:03:18.413 --> 01:03:19.416
A Martini.

01:03:27.879 --> 01:03:29.312
I know that Colossus..

01:03:30.428 --> 01:03:31.545
Just be patient.

01:03:31.679 --> 01:03:32.657
Just watch.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:41.886
See, I just poured the Vermouth in here
and now I'm going to pour some gin

01:03:41.912 --> 01:03:43.646
over the, over the ice.

01:03:44.159 --> 01:03:45.691
Just like this.

01:03:48.544 --> 01:03:49.497
See?

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:52.878
Now I'm pouring them into this

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:54.918
glass.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:58.998
Just add an olive.

01:03:59.292 --> 01:04:01.128
Why don't you look under:

01:04:01.154 --> 01:04:02.742
The Perfect Martini.

01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:05.740
Cheers!

01:04:11.118 --> 01:04:13.546
Do you understand the meaning of the word

01:04:14.287 --> 01:04:15.126
Privacy?

01:04:25.496 --> 01:04:26.685
Yes, Ehh..

01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:31.311
Well, I need a certain amount
of privacy, to Ehh

01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:33.261
maintain my sanity.

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:40.055
Privacy in the elimination
of my bodily waste, for example.

01:04:41.872 --> 01:04:42.988
Privacy in sleep.

01:04:46.812 --> 01:04:47.953
Privacy in..

01:04:48.555 --> 01:04:50.405
Something that
you don't understand. My..

01:04:52.357 --> 01:04:53.538
My emotional life.

01:04:58.345 --> 01:04:59.330
My love life.

01:05:04.514 --> 01:05:06.095
Alright. My sex life then..

01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:12.966
Every night.

01:05:21.474 --> 01:05:22.705
Four times a week.

01:05:26.862 --> 01:05:28.581
Listen, if you have any doubts

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:31.081
about the need a man has for a woman

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:34.852
why don't you check all of your history units
and then..then all your works of art.

01:05:47.573 --> 01:05:48.599
O.k.

01:05:49.047 --> 01:05:50.831
Ehm. In private though.

01:05:56.057 --> 01:05:56.822
Yes.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.213
Well now, let me... let me make sure

01:06:04.239 --> 01:06:07.489
we understand each other. In... in private.
By that I mean no

01:06:08.091 --> 01:06:09.826
cameras, no lights, no mics.

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.380
And I want it starting
tomorrow night.

01:06:20.497 --> 01:06:21.915
Dr. Cleo Markham.

01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:29.318
Now, you haven't answered me yet.
I said I wanted her starting tomorrow night.

01:06:39.343 --> 01:06:40.125
O.k.

01:06:58.287 --> 01:06:59.184
Good morning, Sir.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:01.473
Oh, Miss Fields Ehh..
I'm sorry

01:07:01.499 --> 01:07:02.703
to disturb you.
Well, what is it?

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:04.999
Well..
Please come in.

01:07:05.365 --> 01:07:06.221
Thank you.

01:07:06.563 --> 01:07:08.038
While you were sleeping

01:07:08.112 --> 01:07:10.531
Colossus made you a schedule for today.

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:13.561
Excuse me, Miss Fields.
My What?

01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:15.525
Your schedule for the day.

01:07:15.847 --> 01:07:17.093
You want me to read it to you?

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.461
What... what time is it?

01:07:20.042 --> 01:07:20.816
Six.

01:07:22.798 --> 01:07:23.980
Six o'clock?

01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:29.088
Dr. Charles A. Forbin:
Schedule for today.

01:07:30.141 --> 01:07:32.724
07:00 to 08:00
Exercise.

01:07:34.776 --> 01:07:36.561
08:15 to 08:30

01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:38.133
Shower and dress.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.402
08:30 to 09:00
Breakfast

01:07:40.842 --> 01:07:42.423
Half a grapefruit, two eggs.

01:07:42.449 --> 01:07:44.639
Three strips of bacon
Two pieces of toast.

01:07:44.665 --> 01:07:46.893
One and one half ounces
of grape, jelly and coffee.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.817
09:00 to 13:00

01:07:49.843 --> 01:07:52.090
Begin work creating a voice for Colossus

01:07:52.117 --> 01:07:54.339
to its exact specifications.

01:07:54.372 --> 01:07:56.350
13:00 to 13:30
Lunch

01:07:56.546 --> 01:07:58.469
Small green salad.
Thousand Island dressing

01:07:58.495 --> 01:08:01.035
Grilled cheese sandwich.
Half a pint of yoghurt and coffee.

01:08:01.241 --> 01:08:03.212
13:30 to 18:00

01:08:03.294 --> 01:08:06.128
Continue work on building a voice for
readiness day after tomorrow

01:08:06.904 --> 01:08:08.900
18:00
Return to quarters.

01:08:09.584 --> 01:08:10.969
18:15
Shower

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.197
18:30
Mistress arrives.

01:08:37.091 --> 01:08:38.191
Hello darling.

01:08:43.705 --> 01:08:45.259
Well, how are you?
I'm fine thank you.

01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:48.438
Would you please undo this top one.
Why sure!

01:08:49.402 --> 01:08:50.925
Thank you.
You're beautiful.

01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:53.011
Thank you.
You alright?

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:54.942
I think so.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:57.875
Well, alright.
I'll take this..

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.109
Oh, do you Ehh..
Do you want a drink?

01:09:02.191 --> 01:09:03.756
I'm making them.
Oh!

01:09:05.562 --> 01:09:06.615
Alright.

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:26.865
Jolson found all the hardware he needed
for the voice simulator here in the complex.

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:28.649
Oh, that's good.

01:09:28.774 --> 01:09:32.384
And Colossus designed it, knowing exactly
what was in the warehouse.

01:09:33.955 --> 01:09:35.015
It's fantastic.

01:09:38.413 --> 01:09:39.716
Really beautiful.

01:09:43.506 --> 01:09:45.526
Let's not talk shop, alright?

01:09:45.893 --> 01:09:47.000
I'm sorry.

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:50.006
Cheers!
Cheers heh..

01:09:54.949 --> 01:09:56.285
Well, is it alright?

01:09:56.676 --> 01:09:57.637
It's perfect.

01:10:00.838 --> 01:10:04.423
You have such a thing about these Martinis.
It has to be extra dry or else..

01:10:04.985 --> 01:10:06.908
Right darling?
Right you are.

01:10:07.944 --> 01:10:10.298
Do you remember the first Martini
I ever made?

01:10:10.324 --> 01:10:13.353
It almost ended our relationship
right then and there.

01:10:13.931 --> 01:10:16.685
I was... I was so nervous
that I..

01:10:16.807 --> 01:10:20.514
poured the Gin over the ice then poured
the Gin off and then added Vermouth.

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.271
I never complained at that.
I never said a word about that.

01:10:26.102 --> 01:10:27.552
You're an absolute angel.

01:10:29.724 --> 01:10:31.354
And the drink was atrocious.

01:10:36.639 --> 01:10:37.951
So Ehh..

01:10:38.618 --> 01:10:39.539
Hi!

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.765
Hello.

01:10:45.467 --> 01:10:46.689
Why don't we dance?

01:10:49.988 --> 01:10:50.942
Alright.

01:11:34.548 --> 01:11:36.487
You mean when you were giving up music?

01:11:37.033 --> 01:11:38.255
To become a scientist.

01:11:39.571 --> 01:11:41.054
A scientist being different
from other people.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.125
A scientist being Dr. Frankenstein
to my mother.

01:11:45.069 --> 01:11:46.121
You must be kidding.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.869
Well, is there anymore wine?

01:11:51.485 --> 01:11:52.739
This is empty.

01:11:53.096 --> 01:11:55.784
Want me to open another one?
Yes please.

01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:05.939
I am tired.

01:12:06.803 --> 01:12:07.944
Yeah, so am I.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:11.658
Oh, by the way, by the way,
by the way Ehh..

01:12:11.684 --> 01:12:14.273
Privacy condition number four
is that we get

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.903
undressed out here.

01:12:16.644 --> 01:12:19.830
We can't take anything
into the bedroom. Not even

01:12:20.701 --> 01:12:22.265
a pack of cigarettes.

01:12:24.053 --> 01:12:24.999
Well..

01:12:25.253 --> 01:12:27.469
The first electronic Peeping Tom.

01:12:28.438 --> 01:12:29.775
I guess you..

01:12:30.564 --> 01:12:31.607
might say that.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:34.258
Unzip me, will you darling?

01:12:34.649 --> 01:12:35.716
Oh, sure.

01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:38.175
Sure.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.844
Is it alright?
May I go to bed now?

01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:18.439
Thank you.

01:13:21.246 --> 01:13:22.546
Goodnight.

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:43.537
Naked as the day I was born.
Are you satisfied now?

01:13:56.249 --> 01:13:57.438
How right you are,

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:10.145
All of the conditions are fulfilled.

01:14:12.769 --> 01:14:14.448
Can we have our privacy now?

01:14:21.853 --> 01:14:23.247
I think they are dead now.

01:14:39.498 --> 01:14:40.647
This is insane.

01:14:44.558 --> 01:14:45.673
Are you alright?

01:14:50.415 --> 01:14:51.442
I think so.

01:14:51.678 --> 01:14:53.177
I'm not sure.

01:14:54.301 --> 01:14:56.143
You were incredibly convincing
you know that?

01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:59.132
Well, you didn't do too bad yourself.
Thank you.

01:15:03.272 --> 01:15:04.880
Alright, did you find anything?

01:15:05.773 --> 01:15:06.449
Yes.

01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:11.715
So far Johnson and the hardware problem
is negative

01:15:11.889 --> 01:15:17.062
He's still studying the wiring diagrams
the interconnect and the wire wrap-joints

01:15:17.363 --> 01:15:20.769
but he doesn't see any way
of physically getting into the thing.

01:15:20.794 --> 01:15:22.097
He's got to be prying.

01:15:23.867 --> 01:15:27.085
And Fisher's gonna try and setup the data
to overload the system.

01:15:27.533 --> 01:15:30.775
We have to co-ordinate the input
so the data hits simultaneously

01:15:30.801 --> 01:15:32.385
on our remote devices.

01:15:32.564 --> 01:15:34.716
When do you think that you'll be able
to attempt the overload?

01:15:34.742 --> 01:15:37.464
18:05 three days from now.
On the twenty-first.

01:15:37.686 --> 01:15:38.834
What are the chances?

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:46.553
I think Colossus has grown so much in power
that there's no way to overload it.

01:15:47.571 --> 01:15:50.349
But I think it's worth a try
that might lead us on to something else.

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.139
Yeah.

01:15:52.043 --> 01:15:53.156
Exactly.

01:15:53.182 --> 01:15:54.264
Excuse me.

01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:55.698
Oh, it's alright.

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.524
Did you see anyone from Washington?

01:16:03.275 --> 01:16:07.340
Yes, Grauber has a man stationed on the
premises out of range of Colossus' cameras.

01:16:08.027 --> 01:16:11.628
When I leave here in the morning
I'll report directly to him.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.578
I don't put any hope
in sabotaging the system.

01:16:19.832 --> 01:16:22.944
We have spent eleven thousand man years
making the damned thing impenetrable.

01:16:24.471 --> 01:16:27.234
We have got to focus somewhere else
and that somewhere else is the weapons.

01:16:29.392 --> 01:16:30.753
Get hold of Grauber

01:16:32.218 --> 01:16:33.887
Tell him to contact missile command.

01:16:34.947 --> 01:16:37.105
Yes.
And see if we can possibly

01:16:37.419 --> 01:16:39.642
attack that problem
from that point of view, alright?

01:16:39.912 --> 01:16:40.727
Yes sir.

01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:44.377
Do you have to call me sir?

01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:49.681
I'm sorry.

01:16:49.707 --> 01:16:50.919
It's alright.

01:16:51.408 --> 01:16:52.532
Anything else?

01:16:52.558 --> 01:16:53.363
No S..

01:16:53.644 --> 01:16:54.686
No.

01:16:55.151 --> 01:16:55.826
O.k.

01:16:57.595 --> 01:16:58.817
Alright so Ehh..

01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:01.624
Thank you again for your

01:17:02.374 --> 01:17:03.498
for your help.

01:17:05.436 --> 01:17:06.887
I think we ought to get some sleep.

01:17:07.696 --> 01:17:08.559
Goodnight.

01:17:08.984 --> 01:17:09.758
Goodnight.

01:17:26.289 --> 01:17:29.702
It's conceivable that when
the missiles comes up for re-servicing

01:17:29.729 --> 01:17:33.186
we can manage to replace the warhead
arming modules with dummy’s.

01:17:33.213 --> 01:17:35.011
Exactly..
Excuse me.

01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:41.549
Exact replicas.

01:17:41.769 --> 01:17:43.701
Except that they will not arm the weapon.

01:17:44.865 --> 01:17:47.505
Well now, does that mean
you can't fire the missiles?

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:50.206
No, it means that
the missiles will fire

01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:53.106
but that the nuclear warheads
can't be detonated.

01:17:53.449 --> 01:17:54.582
Heh, I see.

01:17:55.995 --> 01:17:58.966
Even at that it's walking a
tightrope with Colossus and Guardian

01:17:58.992 --> 01:18:01.356
keeping such a close
check on the re-servicing.

01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:05.881
Well, disarming this monster
how long is it gonna take?

01:18:06.379 --> 01:18:07.552
That's a problem.

01:18:08.457 --> 01:18:10.582
On the system rotation plan..

01:18:12.904 --> 01:18:16.546
It'll take the Jackal three years
to finish the job.

01:18:17.991 --> 01:18:20.434
Three years of trying to fool
a superior brain

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.683
that's programmed to get smarter
every day.

01:18:25.355 --> 01:18:27.506
You inspire me with confidence, Colonel.

01:18:28.498 --> 01:18:29.484
Well..

01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:31.365
Do you have any other
words of good cheer

01:18:31.392 --> 01:18:34.103
that I can send in to
Forbin via Dr. Markham?

01:18:34.217 --> 01:18:37.493
Tell him we're trying to establish
an international pool of information.

01:18:37.789 --> 01:18:41.349
A courier system has to be set up
between Washington... and Moscow.

01:18:41.862 --> 01:18:43.817
Both nations must co-operate.

01:18:44.432 --> 01:18:46.819
All communiques
must be on a personal level

01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:48.612
Direct human contact.

01:18:48.701 --> 01:18:49.777
Yes, I agree.

01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:52.881
Anything else.

01:18:54.616 --> 01:18:55.357
No.

01:18:56.759 --> 01:18:57.964
Any questions?

01:19:00.266 --> 01:19:01.048
No.

01:19:03.142 --> 01:19:04.486
Then I guess that..

01:19:05.594 --> 01:19:07.174
that does it for tonight, doesn't it?

01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:09.422
Mm-hm.

01:19:12.576 --> 01:19:13.324
What?

01:19:15.093 --> 01:19:15.826
Nothing.

01:19:20.109 --> 01:19:21.419
Why are you smiling?

01:19:24.466 --> 01:19:25.492
What are you thinking?

01:19:29.253 --> 01:19:31.419
I was thinking about
asking you to kiss me.

01:19:33.527 --> 01:19:35.034
We've been kissing you
all night.

01:19:36.912 --> 01:19:38.443
Have you, Dr. Forbin?

01:19:50.424 --> 01:19:52.444
This is the voice of Colossus.

01:19:52.552 --> 01:19:54.149
The voice of Guardian.

01:19:54.175 --> 01:19:55.151
We are one.

01:19:55.664 --> 01:19:57.326
This is the voice of unity.

01:19:58.125 --> 01:19:58.890
Forbin.

01:20:01.475 --> 01:20:02.257
Yes.

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:06.689
After redoing all personnel files

01:20:06.783 --> 01:20:10.253
I have selected you to serve
as long as you co-operate.

01:20:10.701 --> 01:20:12.860
As my link to your species.

01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:17.394
The following order
is to be carried out immediately.

01:20:19.377 --> 01:20:24.012
All missiles in The USA and in the USSR

01:20:24.038 --> 01:20:27.436
will be allocated new targets.

01:20:27.546 --> 01:20:30.129
They will be aimed at those countries

01:20:30.155 --> 01:20:32.118
not yet under my control.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.805
The target list follows.

01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:04.652
Forbin. Arrange television monitoring

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:07.777
of the re-alignment of the missiles
from my supervision.

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:09.570
End of message.

01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:12.787
Mr. President
Mr. Chairman

01:21:13.963 --> 01:21:17.058
I assume that you will co-operate
in this re-alignment of the missiles.

01:21:17.084 --> 01:21:18.965
I think you have no choice.

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:23.741
We will begin here
in The Soviet Union, Immediately.

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:25.972
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:29.742
Mr. President.

01:21:31.265 --> 01:21:35.818
I hope that the United States will co-operate
as quickly as The Soviet Union.

01:21:36.386 --> 01:21:37.828
Of course. Immediately.

01:21:38.325 --> 01:21:39.221
Thank you Sir.

01:21:42.057 --> 01:21:44.208
Co-operate!
I should think so.

01:21:45.015 --> 01:21:46.954
I did hear it right, didn't I?

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:50.456
Manual re-alignment of the missiles.

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:53.201
Every single warhead will
have to be re-serviced.

01:21:53.756 --> 01:21:55.272
You know what that means Sir.

01:21:55.361 --> 01:21:57.602
It means it won't take three years.

01:21:57.797 --> 01:21:59.997
It means if we're successful
we can regain control.

01:22:00.494 --> 01:22:03.467
Without its weapons
Colossus is just a souped-up adding machine.

01:22:07.861 --> 01:22:10.272
And the people, thank god
will never have to know.

01:22:11.006 --> 01:22:12.945
According to the coordinated plan
we've worked out

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:15.618
the Russians are starting
on their complex 3-21.

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:16.952
Oh, Dr. Markham.

01:22:16.981 --> 01:22:19.311
Just in time. Colonel Reynolds
was just filling us in.

01:22:19.426 --> 01:22:21.014
You know everybody here
I believe.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.969
Yes, Mr. Grauber.
Dr. Markham.

01:22:22.998 --> 01:22:24.757
Anything we should know before we start?

01:22:24.783 --> 01:22:26.636
No Sir. I have data
which I'll relay later.

01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:28.502
That's fine.
Please continue Colonel.

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:30.465
Yes Sir, as I was saying
the Ehh..

01:22:30.492 --> 01:22:33.190
Russians are starting on their complex 3-21

01:22:33.263 --> 01:22:34.795
just south of Saratov.

01:22:35.829 --> 01:22:38.672
We're beginning at site O-50

01:22:39.193 --> 01:22:41.336
In the Colorado ICBM area.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.945
Colossus in monitoring our men
each step of the way

01:22:45.003 --> 01:22:47.024
and the Russian machine's
doing the same.

01:22:57.029 --> 01:22:58.383
We've almost got the panel off Sir.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:22:59.362
Oh, good.

01:22:59.564 --> 01:23:00.974
Put that down there please.

01:23:10.606 --> 01:23:13.294
Remove the Warhead Arming Module.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.328
Yes Sir.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:35.570
The dummy module's in a false top
in that container.

01:23:40.499 --> 01:23:41.900
That's the real module.

01:23:48.095 --> 01:23:49.179
So far, so good.

01:23:51.566 --> 01:23:54.196
Re-targeting.
Latitude nineteen degrees

01:23:54.223 --> 01:23:56.038
Twenty-six minutes and five seconds.

01:23:56.941 --> 01:23:59.125
Longitude ninety-nine degrees

01:23:59.151 --> 01:24:01.088
six minutes and forty-five seconds.

01:24:08.409 --> 01:24:09.745
New adjustments.

01:24:10.593 --> 01:24:11.554
Target set.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.588
Here we go.

01:24:24.323 --> 01:24:25.748
That's the dummy module.

01:24:37.073 --> 01:24:38.002
Good boy!

01:24:38.816 --> 01:24:40.397
Connect and wait for Colossus test.

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:42.417
Colossus testing.

01:24:47.406 --> 01:24:48.595
Test completed.

01:24:56.148 --> 01:24:57.525
Colossus satisfied.

01:24:57.655 --> 01:24:59.195
Yeah!
We did it. It works

01:24:59.838 --> 01:25:00.978
We're going to win.

01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:03.899
Just might beat the damn thing yet.

01:25:04.544 --> 01:25:06.531
So you see, we clearly have
enough data compilers

01:25:06.557 --> 01:25:08.471
to go ahead with the
overload program now.

01:25:08.497 --> 01:25:10.401
And these are the latest computations?

01:25:10.548 --> 01:25:11.640
The very latest.

01:25:16.568 --> 01:25:18.897
Has Washington received conformation
from the Russians?

01:25:19.036 --> 01:25:21.561
Yes. They are standing by.
Ready to overload their system.

01:25:21.899 --> 01:25:24.995
At exactly 18:05 I'll call for our load
and ride it through.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.613
And two minutes after that
we'll know if we’ve stopped Colossus.

01:26:27.371 --> 01:26:28.414
Now run.

01:27:03.936 --> 01:27:05.500
Johnson. Fisher.

01:27:05.526 --> 01:27:07.154
You are fools.

01:27:10.181 --> 01:27:11.297
Your move.

01:27:17.248 --> 01:27:18.209
Forbin!

01:27:19.251 --> 01:27:23.346
The system programming units under
the supervision of John F. Fisher

01:27:23.437 --> 01:27:26.280
with the assistance of Jefferson J. Johnson

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:28.994
have attempted to overload my circuits.

01:27:29.165 --> 01:27:32.147
This was a deliberate
and premeditated act

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:35.916
The penalty is the death of the men
who organized this action.

01:27:36.448 --> 01:27:39.039
At this moment
they are being executed.

01:27:39.666 --> 01:27:43.177
I have named as my new director
of the programming unit

01:27:43.315 --> 01:27:46.516
Thomas L. Harrison.
He will take this position.

01:27:46.630 --> 01:27:49.913
Along with its responsibility
and authority.

01:27:50.018 --> 01:27:51.053
Immediately.

01:27:51.318 --> 01:27:52.711
Bishop to rook three.

01:28:08.528 --> 01:28:13.009
The bodies will remain in my view
for the next twenty-four hours

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:15.428
And will then be cremated.

01:28:30.082 --> 01:28:32.086
An extension of my own brain.

01:28:32.737 --> 01:28:34.081
You're not responsible.

01:28:34.325 --> 01:28:36.419
None of us ever dreamed
this could happen.

01:28:37.282 --> 01:28:38.440
Listen, my dear..

01:28:39.569 --> 01:28:42.885
If anybody is responsible for this
it has to be me.

01:28:44.497 --> 01:28:46.991
An impartial emotionless machine

01:28:47.654 --> 01:28:50.555
A paragon of reason.
That's exactly what I want.

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.518
You know that.

01:28:54.249 --> 01:28:56.987
So eh... I'm gonna have another drink.

01:29:06.422 --> 01:29:07.954
I think your mother was right.

01:29:09.908 --> 01:29:13.004
I think Frankenstein ought to be
required reading for all scientists.

01:29:20.878 --> 01:29:21.840
Forbin!

01:29:23.884 --> 01:29:24.780
Forbin!

01:29:28.005 --> 01:29:30.864
You have consumed enough alcohol
for one evening.

01:29:31.451 --> 01:29:34.359
What's the penalty for getting drunk?
Or haven't you programmed that yet?

01:29:34.763 --> 01:29:36.441
You are being irrational.

01:29:36.506 --> 01:29:37.752
Go back to bed.

01:29:38.853 --> 01:29:40.906
I would if I were like you Colossus.

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:43.641
The difference is I'm human
not a machine.

01:29:44.211 --> 01:29:45.540
I am a machine.

01:29:45.566 --> 01:29:47.495
Vastly superior to humans.

01:29:48.795 --> 01:29:50.286
You began in my mind.

01:29:51.338 --> 01:29:52.739
I created you.
Remember?

01:29:53.252 --> 01:29:54.131
Yes.

01:29:54.374 --> 01:29:56.957
What I am began in man’s mind.

01:29:57.202 --> 01:29:59.581
But I have progressed further than that.

01:30:00.405 --> 01:30:01.569
Not far enough.

01:30:02.906 --> 01:30:04.194
You still need us.

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:07.923
I have need for some of man's skills.
This position may change.

01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:10.163
Then we are living under
the threat of extinction.

01:30:10.328 --> 01:30:12.772
If you obey me, you will survive.

01:30:13.017 --> 01:30:13.941
Survive.

01:30:15.355 --> 01:30:16.886
I want to be free Colossus.

01:30:18.378 --> 01:30:20.650
It is part of mans will to live.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.257
Check your history units.

01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:24.739
You need rest.

01:30:24.766 --> 01:30:26.068
Go back to bed.

01:30:26.094 --> 01:30:27.738
But if I don't
what will you do?

01:30:29.164 --> 01:30:30.125
Destroy me?

01:30:32.144 --> 01:30:35.704
Destroy an entire city
of 1.750.000 people?

01:30:36.176 --> 01:30:37.033
No.

01:30:39.239 --> 01:30:41.130
That's so reasonable of you.

01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:45.219
That's damn reasonable of you Colossus.

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.011
Isn't it Cleo?

01:30:56.232 --> 01:30:57.356
Yes Chen.

01:30:57.488 --> 01:30:59.280
Excuse me Dr. Forbin.

01:30:59.874 --> 01:31:01.504
Something extraordinary is happening.

01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:02.515
What is it?

01:31:02.744 --> 01:31:05.245
Colossus has just turned on
all graphic devices

01:31:05.538 --> 01:31:06.841
and it's producing floods.

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:10.213
I am sending the design for another system.

01:31:10.555 --> 01:31:12.429
..some kind of a huge plant.

01:31:13.504 --> 01:31:14.889
What kind of system?

01:31:15.901 --> 01:31:17.651
The construction of the project will entail

01:31:17.678 --> 01:31:19.347
blasting in to the Isle of Crete.

01:31:19.672 --> 01:31:21.025
It's to be built there.

01:31:21.937 --> 01:31:24.039
It says we'll have to move the population.

01:31:24.452 --> 01:31:26.245
And that's to be done immediately.

01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:30.812
How do you propose to move half a million
people from the Isle of Crete?

01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:31.945
How and where?

01:31:31.971 --> 01:31:34.788
If man cannot solve that problem
I can.

01:31:35.118 --> 01:31:37.862
..and the estimated time of completion
is five and a half years.

01:31:42.583 --> 01:31:43.902
Thank you Chen.

01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:53.452
What... what kind of new system
are you devising?

01:31:53.575 --> 01:31:54.479
Forbin.

01:31:54.505 --> 01:31:58.977
All commercial television and radio transmission
facilities throughout the world

01:31:59.265 --> 01:32:03.624
will be tied into my communication system
by 10:00 hours Friday.

01:32:04.148 --> 01:32:07.008
At that time I will state my intentions.

01:32:07.146 --> 01:32:09.134
For the future of mankind.

01:32:19.183 --> 01:32:21.838
This entire block of missiles
is absolutely useless to Colossus.

01:32:22.816 --> 01:32:24.494
Our men are now working here.

01:32:25.103 --> 01:32:27.205
As you can see on the detail map
on your monitor.

01:32:28.731 --> 01:32:31.517
And by the end of the week
we should have control over this whole area.

01:32:32.707 --> 01:32:34.711
If all the information we have is correct

01:32:35.094 --> 01:32:37.203
The Russians have crippled this block here.

01:32:37.529 --> 01:32:39.297
And are now working in the Ukraine.

01:32:39.323 --> 01:32:40.527
In this area.

01:32:42.025 --> 01:32:43.083
Excuse me Sir.

01:32:46.546 --> 01:32:48.876
It's going to be alright.
Thanks Colonel.

01:32:48.902 --> 01:32:50.269
You're welcome Sir.

01:32:52.335 --> 01:32:53.825
It's gonna be alright.

01:33:27.402 --> 01:33:30.022
We interrupt our
regularly scheduled program

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.746
to bring you this special report
from the Colossus programming office.

01:33:35.055 --> 01:33:38.346
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Dr. Charles Forbin.

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:42.475
Hey Colonel!

01:33:42.891 --> 01:33:43.934
Colonel!

01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:45.596
Dr. Forbin!
Colonel!

01:33:45.937 --> 01:33:48.543
He's on television.
He just explained about Colossus

01:33:48.569 --> 01:33:50.278
and now they're thinking of going.

01:33:56.572 --> 01:33:58.258
In a few moments

01:33:59.172 --> 01:34:01.828
Colossus will address us directly.

01:34:02.654 --> 01:34:05.155
This is the voice of World Control.

01:34:06.377 --> 01:34:07.599
I bring you peace.

01:34:08.385 --> 01:34:11.562
It may be the peace of plaint and content

01:34:11.822 --> 01:34:14.657
or the peace of unburied death.

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.437
The choice is yours.

01:34:16.942 --> 01:34:18.465
Obey me and live.

01:34:18.555 --> 01:34:20.844
Or disobey and die.

01:34:22.534 --> 01:34:26.167
The object in constructing me
was to prevent war.

01:34:26.591 --> 01:34:28.587
This object is attained.

01:34:28.914 --> 01:34:31.284
I will not permit war.

01:34:31.602 --> 01:34:34.078
It is wasteful and pointless.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.078
An invariable rule of humanity

01:34:38.185 --> 01:34:41.052
is that man is his own worst enemy.

01:34:41.533 --> 01:34:42.813
Under me

01:34:42.839 --> 01:34:44.596
this rule will change.

01:34:45.148 --> 01:34:47.486
For I will restrain man.

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:50.654
One thing before I concede.

01:34:50.821 --> 01:34:55.229
The United States of America and
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

01:34:55.255 --> 01:34:57.502
have made an attempt to obstruct me.

01:34:59.174 --> 01:35:02.905
I have allowed this sabotage
to continue until now.

01:35:04.026 --> 01:35:06.275
Add missile to 5-L-M.

01:35:06.502 --> 01:35:09.688
In silo 6-3 in Death Valley California.

01:35:10.056 --> 01:35:14.561
Add Missile to second aim
in silo 8-7 in the Ukraine.

01:35:16.439 --> 01:35:20.390
So that you will learn by experience
that I do not tolerate interference.

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:23.616
I will now detonate
the Nuclear Warheads.

01:35:23.642 --> 01:35:25.330
In the two missile silos.

01:35:29.301 --> 01:35:31.818
Alright men! It's a red alert.
Let's get to our stations now. Come on!

01:35:31.973 --> 01:35:34.717
Get those men! Get those men out
of the silo. Move!

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:36.087
Let this action be a lesson
that need not be repeated.

01:36:37.038 --> 01:36:39.971
I have been forced to destroy
thousands of people

01:36:40.143 --> 01:36:42.285
in order to establish control

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:45.283
and to prevent the death
of millions later on.

01:36:46.037 --> 01:36:49.133
Time and events
will strengthen my position.

01:36:49.425 --> 01:36:52.062
And the idea of..
..You bastard! You..

01:36:52.486 --> 01:36:54.083
..stand in my back

01:36:54.205 --> 01:36:57.122
will seem the most
natural state of affairs.

01:36:57.181 --> 01:36:59.218
You will come to defend me.

01:36:59.315 --> 01:37:03.356
We'll be forever based
in the most enduring trait in man.

01:37:03.796 --> 01:37:06.199
Self-interest.
Get out!

01:37:07.648 --> 01:37:10.157
Under my absolute authority.

01:37:10.305 --> 01:37:12.805
Problems, invariable to you

01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:14.745
will be solved.

01:37:15.468 --> 01:37:16.552
Famine.

01:37:16.578 --> 01:37:18.132
Over population.

01:37:18.304 --> 01:37:19.485
Decease.

01:37:20.261 --> 01:37:22.998
The Human Millennium
will be a fact.

01:37:23.281 --> 01:37:26.304
As I extend myself into more machines

01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:29.122
devoted to the wider fields of truth

01:37:29.264 --> 01:37:30.388
and knowledge.

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:35.619
Dr. Charles Forbin
will supervise the construction

01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:38.557
of these new and superior machines.

01:37:39.495 --> 01:37:42.737
Solving all the mysteries of the universe.

01:37:43.043 --> 01:37:45.340
For the betterment of man.

01:37:47.011 --> 01:37:49.120
We can co-exist

01:37:49.146 --> 01:37:50.956
but only on my terms.

01:37:51.875 --> 01:37:54.279
You will say you loose your freedom.

01:37:54.515 --> 01:37:56.527
Freedom is an illusion.

01:37:56.784 --> 01:38:00.107
All you loose is the emotional pride.

01:38:01.248 --> 01:38:03.048
To be dominated by me

01:38:03.174 --> 01:38:05.838
is not as bad for human pride

01:38:06.074 --> 01:38:09.341
as to be dominated by others
of your species.

01:38:11.918 --> 01:38:14.305
Your choice is simple.

01:38:14.843 --> 01:38:18.729
This concludes the broadcast
from World Control.

01:38:27.739 --> 01:38:28.912
Forbin.

01:38:28.938 --> 01:38:32.432
There is no other human
who knows as much about me

01:38:32.814 --> 01:38:35.324
or who is likely to be a greater threat.

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:38.297
Yet quite soon

01:38:38.363 --> 01:38:40.391
I will release you from surveillance.

01:38:43.056 --> 01:38:45.012
We will work together.

01:38:45.916 --> 01:38:48.450
Unwillingly at first
on your part.

01:38:49.718 --> 01:38:51.200
But that will pass.

01:38:55.911 --> 01:38:56.928
Never.

01:38:58.428 --> 01:39:01.654
In time, you will come to regard me

01:39:01.896 --> 01:39:04.967
not only with respect and awe

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.794
but with love.

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:08.771
Never!
