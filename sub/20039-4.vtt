00:11.200 --> 00:13.467
What are you doing,
Hector?

00:13.467 --> 00:15.967
Oh, I know you don't just
want me sitting around,

00:15.967 --> 00:17.900
so I'm going to sell
birdhouses.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.200
I learned how to
make 'em in prison.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.067
Yeah? Is that a step up
or a step down

00:21.067 --> 00:22.433
from making wine
out of your toilet?

00:22.433 --> 00:23.800
Come on.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.233
Shh! Please.

00:26.233 --> 00:28.300
Good morning, everybody.
I just want everybody to see

00:28.300 --> 00:29.633
what I'm having
for breakfast today.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.133
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?

00:31.133 --> 00:32.400
If you must know,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.300
I'm trying to monetize
my breakfast.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.767
I figure if I post myself

00:35.767 --> 00:38.233
eating a few things from
a few major corporations

00:38.233 --> 00:40.000
and it goes viral,
I can get paid to eat it.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.767
Well, you've got to
post 12 times if you
really want to hit.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.633
You do too little,
people go somewhere else.

00:44.633 --> 00:46.833
You do too much,
saturate your page,

00:46.833 --> 00:48.800
and you look thirsty.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.133
And how do you know that?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.333
How do you
not know that?

00:51.333 --> 00:53.367
And when people
start to pay attention,

00:53.367 --> 00:57.100
I'll become a spokesperson
like Flo from Progressive.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.567
That's probably
the stupidest thing
that I've ever heard.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.633
You know what
you need to do?

01:00.633 --> 01:03.200
You need to get off
your ass and go do
something that's real.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.233
This is what doing
something looks like
to my generation, George.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.433
Your generation?

01:07.433 --> 01:09.833
All right.
We've got work to do.

01:09.833 --> 01:12.467
Wait a minute.
We're working on "Valleys"?
You didn't call.

01:12.467 --> 01:14.633
No, I'm tutoring
Manolo at math.

01:14.633 --> 01:17.633
Oh. Really?
What?
I'm great at math.

01:17.633 --> 01:21.200
Oh, I'm sure you are.
You just don't strike me
as the patient type.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.233
You ever work with Manolo?
Hey.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.167
Hey, so what's going on
with "Valleys"?

01:26.167 --> 01:28.067
You said the network
wanted it and it's been
like a week already.

01:28.067 --> 01:30.433
Well, the wheels
are turning, George.
These things take time.

01:30.433 --> 01:32.100
Well, turn the wheels
faster, okay?

01:32.100 --> 01:33.667
Let's get some movement.
Plug that Tesla in,

01:33.667 --> 01:35.833
get that battery charged,
and let's close this deal.

01:35.833 --> 01:37.367
Relax.
It's gonna happen.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.767
Why are you so anxious?

01:38.767 --> 01:40.067
I'll tell you what
the problem is, Olly.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.467
The man needs to get laid.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.667
You know, I think
I might need to get laid.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.367
I don't want to hear this.
No, no. I mean,

01:45.367 --> 01:46.633
not even for the sex.
Just companionship.

01:46.633 --> 01:48.833
Like, I need to find
a normal woman.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.267
I hate putting myself
out there all the time
and getting rejected.

01:51.267 --> 01:53.733
Hey, don't be silly.
You're George Lopez.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.733
I think that
makes it worse.
You should try Bumble.

01:55.733 --> 01:57.833
It's a dating app where
women make the first move.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.667
That way you don't
even have to worry
about getting rejected.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.767
Is that a real app?
Yes, it's great.

02:01.767 --> 02:04.433
And women love it because
we don't get hit on by creeps.

02:04.433 --> 02:06.100
Huh! Is that
what you think?

02:06.100 --> 02:08.600
When are you
women gonna learn?
We're all creeps.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.900
You proud of that?
Man, what should
my profile picture be?

02:10.900 --> 02:13.700
Like, me at the White House
or me when I met Al Pacino?

02:13.700 --> 02:16.367
No. That's all trying
way too hard.
All right.

02:16.367 --> 02:18.533
And don't do a picture
with a puppy or a lion.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.600
There's too much of that,
believe it or not.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.667
And no landmarks
or outdoorsy shots.

02:22.667 --> 02:25.100
You went whitewater
rafting. We get it.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.600
What if I just put
a picture of me

02:26.600 --> 02:28.700
crying in the corner
in the dark, all alone?

02:28.700 --> 02:31.633
**

02:39.300 --> 02:43.633
All right.
Just set it up there.

02:43.633 --> 02:47.267
Let's see who's ready
to Bumble with Lopez.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.800
Let's see.
(phone chimes)

02:48.800 --> 02:50.833
Oh, that was fast.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.867
Uh-huh.
(phone chimes)

02:53.867 --> 02:55.533
Oh.

02:55.533 --> 02:59.600
(phone chimes)
Oh, man, what?

02:59.600 --> 03:02.367
Have I got the phone
upside down or what?

03:02.367 --> 03:04.500
(groaning)
(phone chimes)

03:04.500 --> 03:07.800
(chiming continues)

03:09.100 --> 03:11.333
You know what, Manolo?
I really admire you

03:11.333 --> 03:12.833
working so hard
to get your GED.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.500
Well, I don't want to
go back to jail.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.067
You're there all day
and all night.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.833
It's, like, relentless.

03:17.833 --> 03:20.167
Well, we'd better
get started.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.967
Hey, I didn't know
you were a smoker.

03:22.967 --> 03:26.100
You look all innocent,
but you smoke cigarettes.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.067
Nope. Never have.
Liar.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.500
You're a smoker.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.533
I bet you think you're
all wild and shit, huh?

03:31.533 --> 03:32.867
Could we change
the subject?

03:32.867 --> 03:34.333
Wild thing, puff, puff.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.533
It's not
for cigarettes, okay?

03:35.533 --> 03:38.200
It's a birth control patch.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.367
I don't want to
go into it.

03:39.367 --> 03:40.767
Neither do I.

03:40.767 --> 03:42.333
I think I'm getting rid
of this dating app.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.067
I'm not into the women
that are swiping me.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.700
That's crazy. Let me
see who's on there.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.333
Hey, what about her?
She's cute

03:48.333 --> 03:50.367
and she likes classic cars.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.600
Oh, I'd consider her,
but she's, like, 45.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.267
You're 56.
No, he's older.

03:55.267 --> 03:56.933
That's what he had me
put on Wikipedia.

03:56.933 --> 03:58.667
Thanks. Tell everybody.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.567
What happened to you
wanting to date a normal woman?

04:01.567 --> 04:03.567
Well, normally,
I like young girls.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.500
Can I explain to you
how the world works?
Okay.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.467
Since I have,
you know, some wealth,

04:07.467 --> 04:09.100
that takes
ten years off me.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.667
Seriously?
Seriously.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.400
And, because I'm famous,
that takes another ten years,

04:12.400 --> 04:14.833
so, really, that's 36,
but I could go 24,

04:14.833 --> 04:16.867
but for some reason,
they're not into me.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.267
Women can be shallow.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.733
Okay. I used to feel
sorry for you. Not anymore.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.667
I like what I like.
Like, this one right here.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.367
Like, she's okay, but
she's got, like, those
"Town & Country" eyes.

04:25.367 --> 04:28.067
Like, one is in
the town and one's
looking at the country.

04:28.067 --> 04:31.433
(laughing)
With that attitude,
you don't deserve anyone.

04:31.433 --> 04:32.767
(phone chimes)

04:32.767 --> 04:34.433
(clears throat)
I don't deserve anyone?

04:34.433 --> 04:36.067
How about that girl
right there?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.933
She said,
"You wanna get a bite?"
I'd bite that.

04:38.933 --> 04:40.100
Damn it.
She's gorgeous.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.667
She's not gorgeous.
She's smokin'.

04:42.667 --> 04:45.867
At least
someone's smoking.

04:45.867 --> 04:48.800
**

04:55.367 --> 04:59.167
Look at us, spending quality
time together on our phones,

04:59.167 --> 05:01.800
not even talking.

05:01.800 --> 05:06.533
Yep. It's nice.
Hey, Beautiful Mind,

05:06.533 --> 05:08.733
shouldn't you be in there
studying with Olly?

05:08.733 --> 05:10.633
She's going over
my homework.

05:10.633 --> 05:12.800
She's shaking her head
and writing a lot.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.567
That can't be good.
No.
Hmm.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.800
So, I've decided
the best way to become

05:17.800 --> 05:19.567
an Internet star
is to Twitter.

05:19.567 --> 05:20.867
I just don't know
what to tweet.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.467
Nobody does. That
doesn't stop anybody.

05:22.467 --> 05:24.633
Hey, you should just
tweet one of your rants.

05:24.633 --> 05:27.167
What do you mean, rants?
I don't rant.
Sure, you do.

05:27.167 --> 05:29.467
You know when you
complain about stuff
and don't shut up

05:29.467 --> 05:31.300
and everyone
gets depressed?
Those are hilarious.

05:31.300 --> 05:35.667
I mean, I do tend
to complain a lot
and I am hilarious.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.833
Ooh, did I tell you about
my Uber driver last night?

05:37.833 --> 05:40.067
Why am I wasting that on you?
That going to Twitter.

05:40.067 --> 05:41.067
(Olly)
Manolo.

05:41.067 --> 05:43.633
That's you.
There you go.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.067
Take the apple in there
for your teacher.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.533
So, George,
when you going out
with this new lady?

05:47.533 --> 05:48.900
Ah, we're having lunch
tomorrow.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.433
You know, we've just
been trading messages,

05:50.433 --> 05:51.633
but I feel like
there's a connection,

05:51.633 --> 05:53.300
like she knows me.
That's cool, man.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.800
Can I see her?
Yep.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.633
How about that?
Yeah, I'm not surprised

05:59.633 --> 06:01.500
she seemed to know you,
because she does.
What?

06:01.500 --> 06:04.367
Your old TV show.
This girl played
your daughter.

06:04.367 --> 06:10.233
Get the... Masiela? No!

06:10.233 --> 06:12.767
Oh, she's hot, though.
You raised her right.

06:12.767 --> 06:16.067
Good luck with that.
Father knows best.

06:18.333 --> 06:21.867
How about that?
George Lopez is
dating his daughter!

06:21.867 --> 06:24.500
I always knew you could be
the Mexican Woody Allen.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.067
I didn't even know
it was Masiela. I mean,
it's been ten years.

06:27.067 --> 06:31.467
She looks entirely different.
She dyed her hair.
Her hair? That's what
you noticed about her?

06:31.467 --> 06:33.400
She's tight.
I don't know.
I feel stupid.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.933
Maybe she was just
reaching out to say hi.

06:34.933 --> 06:37.600
Latino, please.
Why would she just say hi?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.867
Because they're friends.
Because they worked
together for a long time.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.533
That's right. You know,
in situations like that,

06:41.533 --> 06:44.067
sometimes humans form
things called friendships.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.100
Maybe she mistook me
for being human.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.133
That's quitter talk.
She reached out to you
on a dating website.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.367
You're going to score.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.500
**

06:56.567 --> 07:00.433
Oh, my God! George.
Masiela.

07:00.433 --> 07:01.500
Oh!
Oh, my God!

07:01.500 --> 07:04.300
How are you?
God, you look great.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.600
You haven't
changed a bit.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.833
Well, actually,
you've changed a lot.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.333
You look amazing.
Thank you.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.267
I'm not daddy's
little girl anymore.

07:10.267 --> 07:11.367
Well, TV's daddy's girl.

07:11.367 --> 07:12.600
(both laughing)

07:12.600 --> 07:15.300
Yeah. My God,
you look great.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.667
Oh, no, thank you.
Yeah.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.433
Thank you. Hey,
I was a little thrown off,

07:18.433 --> 07:19.767
you know,
to see you on that app.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.100
Your hair was blonde.
Oh, yeah.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.500
That was... that
was a brief phase.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.133
I had too much fun.
Yeah.

07:26.133 --> 07:27.667
And your name was
Melissa on that thing.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.067
Oh, no, it's just
for the app.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.700
It's to keep
the stalkers away.
Yeah.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.633
I've got stalkers too.
They're called divorce
attorneys.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.767
Oh, George,
I heard about that.

07:34.767 --> 07:36.233
No, it's all right.
I'm sorry.

07:36.233 --> 07:37.767
Listen, they took
everything but my bitterness.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.133
They'll never get that,
those bastards.

07:40.133 --> 07:41.700
(both laughing)

07:41.700 --> 07:43.767
So, wow, what have
you been doing since
the last time I saw you?

07:43.767 --> 07:46.333
Oof! Ooh! Still acting.
Yeah.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.867
Yeah.
Of course.

07:47.867 --> 07:51.267
I've written some books.
Oh, well,
you were always smart.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.533
I mean,
what kind of books?

07:52.533 --> 07:55.233
Ah, it's just prose,
poetry.

07:55.233 --> 07:57.433
I've translated the work
of Mother Teresa, so...

07:57.433 --> 07:58.867
Yeah, Mother Teresa.
You know what?

07:58.867 --> 08:00.600
I heard she was
hard to work with.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.667
You have no idea.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.933
(both laughing)
That's funny.

08:03.933 --> 08:06.433
So, what about you?
What have you been up to

08:06.433 --> 08:07.900
that I haven't heard
on TMZ?

08:07.900 --> 08:10.500
Oh, well, thanks.
You know, I'm excited

08:10.500 --> 08:12.700
about this new show that I'm
working on called "Valleys."

08:12.700 --> 08:14.167
Oh, I heard about that.
Yeah.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.933
Yeah, it's like
a Mexican "True Detective."

08:15.933 --> 08:17.200
Right.
No, it's so cool.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.067
So cool.
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.067
But what else?
You know, outside of work?

08:22.067 --> 08:24.067
Outside of work?
Outside of work.

08:24.067 --> 08:30.300
Uh... uh, we should
probably get a couple of...

08:30.300 --> 08:32.067
Drinks?
Drinks.

08:32.067 --> 08:34.767
So, if you want
to multiply one-half
times two-thirds,

08:34.767 --> 08:38.200
what's the first
thing you do?

08:38.200 --> 08:41.300
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm stuck on something else.

08:41.300 --> 08:43.833
How many guys are you
with that you need
a birth control patch?

08:43.833 --> 08:46.267
Manolo, could we just
keep it to math, please?

08:46.267 --> 08:47.500
Okay, sorry.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.500
So, what's the
first thing you do?

08:50.500 --> 08:52.733
Okay, if you must know,

08:52.733 --> 08:54.567
I don't wear the patch
for birth control.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.733
It's hormone therapy
for acne.
Oh.

08:56.733 --> 08:58.733
Yeah. Well, I used to
get teased really bad
in high school

08:58.733 --> 09:00.467
'cause I got
really bad breakouts,

09:00.467 --> 09:02.167
and it's not really
something I like to
talk about.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.267
Sorry to hear that.
I'm being teased at school

09:04.267 --> 09:07.067
by a pregnant woman
smoking a vape pen.
That's horrible.

09:07.067 --> 09:10.767
Yeah, she's really mean.
Oh, no, I meant the
pregnant and smoking thing.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.733
Oh, but I'm sure it's
tough for you as well.

09:13.733 --> 09:17.400
People suck, but math
is always there for you.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.900
(laughing)
Los Feliz, huh?

09:18.900 --> 09:20.300
That's a pretty good
neighborhood.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.300
Well, it's actually
pronounced "Los Felice."

09:23.300 --> 09:26.400
Oh, "Los Felice."
But the neighbors
call the cops

09:26.400 --> 09:27.833
on anybody
who says it like that.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.367
(both laughing)

09:29.367 --> 09:31.267
But, no, it's great there.
I'm really happy there.

09:31.267 --> 09:34.633
I just felt like I needed
a... I needed a change.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.300
No, I get that.
My divorce, you know,

09:37.300 --> 09:40.133
surprisingly, it took me
a little bit longer
to get over it,

09:40.133 --> 09:41.500
and then, with Erica
in Cuba, you know,

09:41.500 --> 09:43.067
the house is so big,
and it's just me.

09:43.067 --> 09:46.900
It's... it's lonely.
Yeah, I get that.
I understand lonely.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.800
That's why I'm online
dating, you know.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.133
You know, it's just,
I want to find someone

09:52.133 --> 09:54.967
that I can just
connect with on
a personal level.

09:54.967 --> 09:57.333
Right.
Even if it's just
for a night.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.733
Yeah.
George.

10:00.733 --> 10:01.767
Yeah?
You're being
uncomfortable right now.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.767
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.567
Yes, you are.
No, no.

10:04.567 --> 10:05.700
I am not
that little girl

10:05.700 --> 10:07.533
that played your
TV daughter anymore.

10:07.533 --> 10:10.200
You have to stop
seeing me that way.
I don't
see you like that.

10:10.200 --> 10:14.233
I am a full-grown
woman now.

10:14.233 --> 10:16.933
You are
a full-grown woman.
Mm-hmm.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.500
And let's toast to that.
Cheers.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.700
Cheers to...
Mmm!

10:25.900 --> 10:28.400
Oh!
Hold on. So you're
actually thinking

10:28.400 --> 10:29.600
of dating Masiela?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.200
What's wrong with that,
Olly? She's 31.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.767
Yeah, but you practically
raised her, George.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.767
Think about it.
Remember that one episode

10:34.767 --> 10:38.200
where Carmen got into
a funk when her best
friend Toby moved away?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.100
You helped her cope.
That's TV, fool.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.767
Come on, that's not
my real daughter!

10:41.767 --> 10:44.000
She's not even Latina.
She's Albanian.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.633
Where is Albania,
anyway?
I don't know.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.900
And you see?
For that reason alone,
it should make it all right.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.467
You make a strong case,
jefe. I approve.

10:49.467 --> 10:52.600
Órale.
I do too,
but word of advice,

10:52.600 --> 10:53.900
don't do that
groaning thing you do

10:53.900 --> 10:55.233
every time you get up
out of a chair.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.800
It's just not attractive
to younger women.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.233
Wait a minute.
I don't do that, do I?

10:59.233 --> 11:01.633
Yeah, you go
something like, Oh! Ai!

11:01.633 --> 11:05.600
Yes. That's it. To a T.
That's exactly it.
Ooh! Ah!

11:05.600 --> 11:10.267
George, listen, I cannot
advise against this
strongly enough, okay?

11:10.267 --> 11:13.200
Dating your TV daughter
is not gonna look good.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.333
If this gets into
the tabloids, it's
gonna kill "Valleys."

11:15.333 --> 11:17.200
Uh, I disagree.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.433
Mickey Rourke dated
Evan Rachel Wood

11:19.433 --> 11:22.200
and she played his daughter
in "The Wrestler."

11:22.200 --> 11:25.433
Now she's on "Westworld"
and he's still alive.

11:25.433 --> 11:28.067
You see? Okay, I think you're
being a little bit dramatic.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.667
Okay, Masiela and I are both
consenting adults, all right?

11:30.667 --> 11:33.500
She's not my daughter
in real life and we
have a connection.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.167
Why not explore that?
Come on.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.267
Just because we acted
in a show a long time ago.

11:37.267 --> 11:40.200
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got to call her back.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.533
(line ringing)

11:41.533 --> 11:45.067
Hey, Masiela.
Hey, it's George.
What's going on?

11:45.067 --> 11:46.667
I'm out here,
just working on the car.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.700
No, you can call me
"Georgie." That's cool.
I kind of like it.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.433
(groaning)
I cannot listen to you
do your flirty voice.

11:51.433 --> 11:52.433
(laughing)
Enjoy.

11:52.433 --> 11:54.700
**

11:54.700 --> 11:57.833
Okay. So, what
did I teach you?

11:57.833 --> 12:01.200
You find the common
denominator and then
you add the numerators.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.067
Perfect. Uhh!
You're gonna do great.

12:03.067 --> 12:05.367
(bell ringing)
I hope so.

12:05.367 --> 12:07.567
Manolo, don't worry.
You're not gonna
go back to jail.

12:07.567 --> 12:10.367
It's not just that.
I want to be more
than just the guy

12:10.367 --> 12:13.067
who drives George Lopez
around because we
grew up together.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.500
Like, maybe I
could be his assistant

12:14.500 --> 12:17.200
and help him read scripts
and shit like that.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.667
Sounds kind
of stupid, huh?

12:18.667 --> 12:20.867
No. No more stupid than
starting a "magency,"

12:20.867 --> 12:23.333
at least according
to most of the town.

12:23.333 --> 12:27.133
Has George said anything?
Is he happy with how
things are going?

12:27.133 --> 12:29.267
I don't think
he's ever happy,
but he really likes you

12:29.267 --> 12:31.667
and he thinks
you're doing a great job.

12:31.667 --> 12:36.200
Well, here it goes.
You still gonna buy me
ice cream after the test?

12:36.200 --> 12:39.867
For a C or better, yeah.
Go on.

12:39.867 --> 12:41.667
You know,
so it's a state dinner

12:41.667 --> 12:43.867
for the president
of Mexico, so...
Mm-hmm.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.400
Barack Obama comes
over and he says,

12:45.400 --> 12:47.767
he says, George,
you didn't eat your mole?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.467
And I said, come on,
man, you don't have to
use that voice.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.200
You won. You don't
have to run again.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.400
And he looked around
and he said, man,
eat your chicken.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.400
(both laughing)

12:55.400 --> 12:57.867
I miss Obama.
Yeah, I miss him too.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.833
Who doesn't miss Obama?
Wow.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.867
Oh, my God!
What the hell?

13:03.867 --> 13:05.800
Constance is here.
Constance who?

13:05.800 --> 13:07.933
Constance Marie,
our former co-star.

13:07.933 --> 13:10.967
Oh, my God! George!
Hey!

13:10.967 --> 13:14.200
Come here!
Give me some love!

13:14.200 --> 13:18.067
What a surprise. Hey.

13:18.067 --> 13:21.500
Hi.
Masiela, is that you?

13:21.500 --> 13:26.300
Oh! Oh, look at you!

13:26.300 --> 13:29.567
George, our baby's
all grown up.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.567
Yeah, well, she's not
our baby, but, you know,
she's grown up.

13:31.567 --> 13:35.467
Ah! Look at this!
I mean, it's like a mini
"George Lopez" reunion.

13:35.467 --> 13:39.433
How fun! Ooh, I heard
through the grapevine
about your new show.

13:39.433 --> 13:42.667
Congratulations.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.300
And I don't want
to be pushy,

13:44.300 --> 13:47.767
but I would love
to be considered
for the female lead.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.600
You know, I wouldn't
ask if the script
wasn't so strong.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.100
No, of course not,
but there's not
a script yet.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.833
I know you.
It's gonna be amazing.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.133
I'm sure it will be,
Constance.

13:56.133 --> 13:57.133
It was so great
to see you.
Yeah.

13:57.133 --> 13:58.733
So good.
Really good.

13:58.733 --> 14:00.800
I hope it's not
another ten years
before we see each--

14:00.800 --> 14:03.400
Can I talk to you
for a minute?
Sure. What's going on?

14:06.067 --> 14:07.700
I see what's
happening here.
What?

14:07.700 --> 14:10.200
She's already lobbying you
for the part, isn't she?

14:10.200 --> 14:12.333
There is no part.
That Albanian bitch.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.200
She already took
one Mexican's job.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.800
I'll be damned
if she takes mine.
No, no, relax, relax.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.067
Masiela's not
looking for a part.
Really?

14:18.067 --> 14:20.700
Then why is she all tarted up
and looking guilty, hmm?

14:20.700 --> 14:22.400
That's a good question.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.833
Oh. Ew!

14:25.833 --> 14:28.167
No "ew"!
Ew!

14:28.167 --> 14:32.333
She's 31. I mean,
on the fame scale,

14:32.333 --> 14:34.067
I could date
somebody that's 24.

14:34.067 --> 14:37.067
George, she played
our daughter!

14:37.067 --> 14:38.367
Okay, but she's
not our daughter.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.067
I mean, I didn't
even want to cast her,

14:40.067 --> 14:41.500
to tell you the truth,
okay? The network

14:41.500 --> 14:44.533
shoved her down my throat
and I'm glad they did...

14:44.533 --> 14:46.067
(laughing)

14:46.067 --> 14:48.067
...because we wouldn't be
having this great reunion

14:48.067 --> 14:50.667
of the three of us
together.

14:50.667 --> 14:53.100
Wow. Where's, uh...

14:53.100 --> 14:58.667
Max and the lady
that played my mom?

14:58.667 --> 15:01.833
**

15:01.833 --> 15:03.233
(laughing)

15:03.233 --> 15:04.633
You know,
so, the network,

15:04.633 --> 15:06.167
they really didn't
shove you down my throat.

15:06.167 --> 15:09.167
George, I get it.
It was an awkward situation.

15:09.167 --> 15:12.067
Yes, it was. Yeah.

15:12.067 --> 15:16.600
Yeah. So, this is it.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.233
Yeah. Yep.
It's nice.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.133
Oh, yeah, thanks.
It's got a beautiful view.

15:21.133 --> 15:22.733
You can see
all of downtown.

15:22.733 --> 15:24.567
Nice.
Yeah.

15:24.567 --> 15:28.900
So, George, if I ask
for a glass of wine,

15:28.900 --> 15:30.967
are you gonna card me?

15:30.967 --> 15:32.933
(laughing)

15:32.933 --> 15:34.433
So that's a yes
or a no?

15:34.433 --> 15:37.067
No, that's... Let's see
what I have in there.

15:40.233 --> 15:43.233
Mmm. This is nice.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.167
This is nice.
To new beginnings.

15:46.167 --> 15:48.300
(glasses clink)

15:50.533 --> 15:53.233
Ooh.
This is amazing.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.067
This fire is just...
It's hot.

15:55.067 --> 15:57.100
...really giving off
a lot of heat.
Yeah.

15:57.100 --> 16:01.533
Ooh. Mmm!

16:01.533 --> 16:06.500
That's better.
Ooh. Much better.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.700
Oh.
Oh.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.167
May I have a refill?
Yes, you absolutely may.

16:10.167 --> 16:15.867
Oh. Uh, yeah. Ah!
There you go.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.667
(clears throat, groans)

16:17.667 --> 16:18.800
Yeah, so, Masiela,

16:18.800 --> 16:21.733
you think you could be
interested in me?

16:21.733 --> 16:25.300
George, of course.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.600
I mean, if it's
written right.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.367
Oh, yeah, you're
talking about "Valleys."

16:33.367 --> 16:35.500
Yeah. I mean, I know
it's a challenging role.
Mm-hmm.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.333
But you can see
I'm not a kid anymore.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.067
I am a grown woman.
I have a lot

16:39.067 --> 16:40.533
of life experience
I can pull from.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.533
I can do this.
Yes, I know you can.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.300
Here's the thing
is that we already
hired an actress.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.733
We hired
a transgender actress.

16:48.733 --> 16:52.300
We hired Coco.
Oh.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.400
Yeah, but, you know,
I mean, I feel what you feel.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.133
I think we have
a connection, you and I.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.500
I think we should probably
take the wine upstairs,

16:58.500 --> 17:00.867
see where the night goes,
and it's a little weird,

17:00.867 --> 17:02.733
but it also feels right.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.367
(groaning)

17:09.367 --> 17:11.600
That was fantastic!

17:11.600 --> 17:14.100
That wasn't weird,
right? Oh!

17:14.100 --> 17:19.600
It was fun
and it wasn't weird.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.533
I'm glad you called.

17:23.533 --> 17:25.367
Oh, I'm glad I called too.

17:25.367 --> 17:27.967
I don't think I've had
a better time with a wife.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.200
(exhaling)

17:29.200 --> 17:32.200
So, George...
Yes, dear.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.833
About that part
on "Valleys"...

17:34.833 --> 17:38.067
Okay, it just got weird.

17:38.067 --> 17:41.067
I don't know if
you've heard, but we
cast that part.

17:41.067 --> 17:44.467
What?
(sighing)

17:44.467 --> 17:47.567
I'd ask for a small part,
but I just had one.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.067
(sighing)

17:50.067 --> 17:51.567
I'm proud of you, George.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.167
You didn't sleep
with your TV daughter

17:53.167 --> 17:55.733
and you had a relationship
with an age-appropriate woman.

17:55.733 --> 17:58.067
May I correct you?
Not a relationship.

17:58.067 --> 18:00.267
Relations. What kind
of world is this?

18:00.267 --> 18:02.633
I can't date my TV daughter,
I can't date my TV wife.

18:02.633 --> 18:05.067
What about your TV mom?
I heard she held up
pretty well.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.367
That's messed up.
But at least
now you're open

18:07.367 --> 18:09.667
to dating women
your own age.
No, I'm not.

18:09.667 --> 18:13.067
Yo! Guess what, everyone?
I passed my test!

18:13.067 --> 18:14.367
Hey!
C or better?

18:14.367 --> 18:16.367
A B! Ice cream, right?

18:16.367 --> 18:17.467
That's a hot fudge sundae
where I come from.

18:17.467 --> 18:18.467
George, you want to come?

18:18.467 --> 18:19.900
No, I'm good.
I ate.

18:19.900 --> 18:23.067
There's a ton of hot waitresses
there, all young.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.800
I probably could
fit some sorbet in,

18:24.800 --> 18:26.633
like mango or something
light.
Yeah.

18:26.633 --> 18:29.600
The last one in the Tesla
is a rotten egg.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.267
(laughing)
How is that thing?

18:32.267 --> 18:35.133
It's good.
(laughing)

18:35.133 --> 18:39.300
(police radio chatter)

18:39.300 --> 18:41.133
What the...?

18:41.133 --> 18:42.467
(siren)

18:44.067 --> 18:45.600
* Uh yeah yeah *

18:45.600 --> 18:48.067
* That's right
come on come on come on *

18:48.067 --> 18:49.900
* Uh yeah yeah *

18:49.900 --> 18:52.300
* Hey *
* Come on come on *

18:52.300 --> 18:55.433
**

19:00.667 --> 19:02.900
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

19:02.900 --> 19:05.333
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

19:05.333 --> 19:07.600
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

19:07.600 --> 19:10.667
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... **
