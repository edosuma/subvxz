00:01.320 --> 00:03.891
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.960 --> 00:07.169
We should've seen HYDRA
coming. But they don't stand a chance.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.207
John Garrett does.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.685
If you're gonna work within
S.H.I.E.L.D. for HYDRA,

00:09.760 --> 00:10.921
you can't get ever attached.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.923
I know that you care about us, Ward!

00:13.000 --> 00:14.286
You're right. I do.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.328
- Ward!
- It's a weakness.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.528
You're still Mike Peterson.
You have a son.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.284
- You and me, what are we?
-We're a team.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.562
So is someone
seeing everything you see?

00:22.640 --> 00:23.721
Waiting to push a button

00:23.800 --> 00:25.689
and blow a hole in your skull
if you disobey?

00:25.760 --> 00:29.048
Garrett doesn't want GH-325
for his Centipede soldiers,

00:29.120 --> 00:30.531
he wants it for himself.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.921
- What are you feeling?
- The universe.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.365
Skye left them
a little surprise.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.521
A Trojan horse.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.762
It's been slowly mapping every
system they've uploaded it to.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.922
If there's a computer system
in that barber shop,

00:40.000 --> 00:41.206
we don't have to chase them anymore.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.644
Sorry about
the security red tape.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.484
You know, intellectual property.
Blah blah blah...

00:47.560 --> 00:48.766
You'll get used to it.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.649
So basically, I've been here
since day one.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.246
Started with me on my computer
in the basement,

00:53.320 --> 00:54.731
and now look what we've grown into.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.724
We've got 20 active systems,
and we're growing fast.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.609
I was gonna ask about
the construction next door.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.604
Ah, yeah, we're planning to add another
100 systems by the end of the month.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.170
That's Sally. Hey, Sally.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.368
So, what, are you just really into
this sort of thing?

01:06.440 --> 01:07.680
Or... What brings you to the company?

01:08.240 --> 01:10.641
Um... The Incentives Program.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.642
Yeah. No one's turned that down yet.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.921
Anyway. So every operator
is in charge of one unit.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.368
You will receive an email
24 hours before it goes online.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.169
Now, some are volunteers,
but some are here

01:25.240 --> 01:27.083
- for the same reason that you're here...
- Hey, Zeller.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.845
- We're in position.
-Okay.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.968
This is good for you to learn
on your first day.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.166
What's going on?

01:34.280 --> 01:35.611
These guys?

01:36.520 --> 01:38.284
We don't like these guys.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.684
Yes, sir, we have them in sight.
Copy that.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.046
Okay, people.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.521
Let them have it.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.284
Could sure use
a little light in here.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.646
Got it.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.803
So who do we talk to
about getting a haircut?

02:08.199 --> 02:09.883
If it isn't The Cavalry.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.326
Don't ever call me that.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.325
Bring the house down.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.685
Time to go!

02:34.240 --> 02:35.241
Aah!

02:35.840 --> 02:37.569
Come on. Let's go.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.321
Our men are still
digging themselves out,

02:49.400 --> 02:51.846
but it looks like Coulson
and the others got away.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.366
- Do you want to...
-Doesn't matter.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.211
- Are you all right?
-What does it look like?

03:04.280 --> 03:06.203
Never better, son.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.931
I need a nail. Get me a nail! A big one.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.568
What the hell is he doing?

03:11.640 --> 03:13.483
He's flexing his new muscles.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.882
He has every ounce of our research
coursing through his veins.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.121
He feels good.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.010
Because he took all of our miracle drug.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.323
When we land at Cybertek,
military brass and investors

03:24.400 --> 03:25.686
are expecting a demonstration,

03:25.760 --> 03:28.764
and I promised them
indestructible super-soldiers.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.888
Not disposable ones.

03:30.960 --> 03:35.363
With HYDRA in the mix,
we won't lack for volunteers.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.566
And if we run out,

03:36.640 --> 03:39.769
our Incentives Program
should help fill the ranks.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.929
Just getting some ideas down.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.923
I can't keep everything in my head.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.607
I gotta be honest with you, John.
Looks like you're kinda losing it.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.081
I'm alive for the first time,
thanks to you.

03:52.160 --> 03:56.324
We took some hits along the way,
but we did it. We did it!

03:57.400 --> 03:58.925
Can't believe it.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.607
This is everything we've been
working towards. Saving you.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.651
Our alliance with HYDRA was
always a means to that end, right?

04:06.720 --> 04:08.290
Symbiotic.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.930
And here we are.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.162
It's not like we're true believers, right?

04:12.240 --> 04:14.846
Don't get me wrong, I'll go where you go.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.810
Having our soldiers
in key positions is great,

04:17.880 --> 04:21.440
but then what?
Are we really planning a coup?

04:21.519 --> 04:22.760
It's more of an uprising.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.730
It's become bigger than HYDRA.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.646
Ward, you've taken good care of me.
Gave me everything I wanted.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.326
It's time for you to decide
what it is you want.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.004
I'll see that you get it, too, son.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.964
I can do anything now.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.171
The Trojan horse worked.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.891
Gave us access
to the system we wanted.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.007
Our secret weapon.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.527
We now have eyes on their operation,
right in the palm of my hand.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.409
We'll need more than eyes
to defeat Garrett.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.210
What is it?

04:58.280 --> 05:01.648
Fitz-Simmons' tracker crossed
the ocean. It's in New Mexico.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.404
They managed to tag the plane?

05:03.480 --> 05:06.245
It appears so. But they're not answering.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.161
No.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.083
We can't think about that right now.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.367
They may have been captured.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.683
Either way, they risked everything
to put a tracker on that plane for us.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.330
Now we know exactly where Garrett is,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.641
and Skye can see what he's doing.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.041
If Fitz and Simmons are still alive,

05:24.120 --> 05:27.249
then catching Garrett is our
only shot at finding them.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.321
You looked very peaceful sleeping.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.647
Didn't wanna wake you,
but I'm glad that you're up.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.529
What's happening?

05:43.600 --> 05:47.844
I've spent the last hour trying
to figure out why we sank.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.848
We're at the bottom of the ocean,

05:51.920 --> 05:54.366
in case you missed that bit.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.522
These pods are built to be compatible

05:56.600 --> 05:59.331
with all S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft,
submarine, spacecraft.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.890
On impact, the atmospheric adaptation

06:00.960 --> 06:02.564
must've tried to compensate.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.201
We slowly sank as it increased
the density of the outer walls.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.447
I measured the rate the water
rose on the glass. Did the math.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.364
We're at least 90 feet down.
You can't see the surface.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.369
How did we survive the fall?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.881
Plane must've been in
vertical flight mode, flying low.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.770
I managed to strap us to one
of the backboards before we hit.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.569
And I broke my arm.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.291
Same two places I broke it
in second grade.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.600
Which is strange.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.889
I thought we were dead for sure, Fitz.
We're so lucky!

06:31.960 --> 06:34.486
Now we just need to figure a way
out of here.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.327
We'll find a way out of here, right?

06:38.400 --> 06:41.643
Then we'd be in the middle
of the ocean with the bends,

06:41.720 --> 06:43.768
no flotation, and no one looking for us.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.487
I already spent an hour trying to rig
the wireless signals on the EKG

06:47.560 --> 06:49.210
to send out a weak distress call

06:49.280 --> 06:50.884
before remembering that
it's a S.H.I.E.L.D. frequency

06:50.960 --> 06:52.086
and no one's listening.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.366
And that's not the problem.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.807
The problem is that
there aren't many supplies left in here,

06:55.880 --> 06:57.120
so, I've already done the math...

06:57.200 --> 06:59.851
Enough with the math!
What are you saying?

07:04.080 --> 07:06.003
There is no way out.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.802
We're going to die down here.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.486
We only get one shot at this,
so let's go over the plan one more time

07:23.560 --> 07:26.291
to make sure we're clear
on exactly what we're doing, okay?

07:26.360 --> 07:27.930
Trip and I will crest the ridge,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.684
use a noisemaker to grab a three-wheel,

07:29.800 --> 07:32.804
maybe something with more fireworks,
and open a window for you two.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.770
You crawl in, grab the dealer,
force his hand,

07:35.840 --> 07:36.921
he'll get us our ace in the hole

07:37.000 --> 07:38.729
- and then Bob's your uncle.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.007
- Roger that.
-Makes it sound easy.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.889
Coulson, it's a solid plan
you've mapped out,

07:42.960 --> 07:45.122
but it hinges on a gamble. A big one.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.443
And back-up isn't coming.
It'll be just the four of us.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.124
We'll be outmanned and outgunned.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.129
--But Fury always said

07:52.240 --> 07:53.321
a man can accomplish anything

07:53.400 --> 07:55.482
when he realizes
he's a part of something bigger.

07:55.560 --> 08:00.043
A team of people who share
that conviction can change the world.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.647
So, what do you say?
You ready to change the world?

08:05.160 --> 08:06.241
No.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.249
But I'm ready to kick some ass.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.405
That works, too.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.286
I'm saying, just talk to him.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.886
He says everything's fine,
but he's not acting that way.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.247
I don't know what's going on with him,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.923
and I don't like it.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.327
Captivating, isn't it?

08:37.400 --> 08:40.609
First time I saw it,
it reminded me of a lava lamp.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.763
Of course, that was before
I could see through it.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.683
Quinn's expecting
the Gravitonium as payment.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.525
When he's done, I think
it would be wise to let him have it.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.762
Don't be coy.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.683
I know you have plans for this stuff.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.730
I understand it now. I can see its soul.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.890
I can see yours, too.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.522
Ward's concerned you're going mad.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.289
The drug didn't just strengthen my body.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.209
It gave me clarity of mind.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.248
It gave me a vision of the world

09:11.360 --> 09:14.887
that's waiting beneath
the surface of this world.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.088
You don't think that's mad, do you?

09:17.840 --> 09:22.164
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
You always have.

09:23.840 --> 09:29.483
I have no allegiance to HYDRA,
Centipede, Cybertek, you.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.162
- I was only ever interested in...
-Evolution.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.050
You know, we're prehistoric creatures

09:37.120 --> 09:39.771
oozing out of the swamps,
through the mist,

09:39.840 --> 09:42.810
clawing our way onto land,
so we can finally stand.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.405
Or plant roots.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.528
- Or fly.
-Exactly.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.762
I was saddened to learn
you weren't clairvoyant.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.889
I had a question
I didn't get to ask, but now...

09:54.960 --> 09:55.961
Now,

09:56.680 --> 09:59.809
the truth is written
on the back of my eyes.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.246
So,

10:01.320 --> 10:02.810
go ahead, Flowers.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.682
Ask.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.361
What will I become?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.085
Are you scared?

10:16.720 --> 10:17.846
Yeah.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.688
And I'm hungry, too.

10:21.760 --> 10:25.128
Me, too. Scared, not hungry.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.646
- What do you think it's like?
-Death?

10:28.440 --> 10:31.125
Depends on the method, really.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.884
Drowning's supposed to be
quite pleasant in the end,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.405
but apparently,
once the water fills up your lungs...

10:34.480 --> 10:35.527
I mean, after.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.840
Oh, yeah, well...

10:36.920 --> 10:40.891
My mum always said
that you shouldn't be afraid,

10:40.960 --> 10:44.931
because it's just like the way
life was before you were born.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.883
- Which wasn't that bad, was it?
-That's sweet.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.808
Though, apparently,
I was miserable before I was born.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.571
Upside down, umbilical cord
all wrapped around my head.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.961
- Well, she meant pre-conception.
-I know, I'm joking.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.963
Yeah, I know that you're joking.
That's fine.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.606
I like to think about
the first law of thermodynamics.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.081
That no energy in the universe
is created.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.924
- And none is destroyed.
-None is destroyed.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.521
That means every bit of energy
inside us,

11:14.600 --> 11:16.011
every particle

11:16.080 --> 11:18.686
will go on to be a part of something else.

11:18.760 --> 11:22.606
Maybe live as a dragonfish. A microbe.

11:22.680 --> 11:26.366
Maybe burn in a supernova
10 billion years from now.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.365
And every part of us now was
once a part of some other thing.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.284
A moon, a storm cloud, a mammoth...

11:33.360 --> 11:36.125
A monkey.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.729
Thousands and thousands
of other beautiful things

11:41.800 --> 11:44.565
that were just as terrified
to die as we are.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.648
We gave them new life.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.442
A good one, I hope.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.166
It's fitting we're down here together, Fitz.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.130
This is where all life began.
On our planet, anyway.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.408
Just outside that glass...

11:58.480 --> 11:59.527
Jemma...

12:01.800 --> 12:02.881
What?

12:02.960 --> 12:05.884
The glass. Fitz, the glass.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.406
Yeah, it's bulletproof,
pressure resistant...

12:09.480 --> 12:11.960
But the seal is four-Hydroxy-
four-methyl-two-pentanone.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.044
Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but
the flash point is too high for it to burn.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.884
But medical ethanol
has a low flash point

12:16.960 --> 12:18.371
-and it burns...
-Hotter.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.886
We could use the defibrillator
as an ignition source.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.485
And build a compressed explosive.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.686
To ignite the seal,

12:23.760 --> 12:24.761
and the outside pressure will

12:24.840 --> 12:25.887
-blow the window in!
-Blow the window in!

12:25.960 --> 12:29.601
- Yes, yes, yes! This really hurts my arm.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.604
Okay. Well, now we know that,
there's a whole new set of problems,

12:32.680 --> 12:34.011
but where do we start?

12:38.280 --> 12:41.124
And, finally, welcome to
our Cybernetics subsection.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.283
Where we design, manufacture,
and, with this,

12:44.360 --> 12:46.362
install our most advanced system.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.163
Ladies and gentlemen, this prototype

12:50.240 --> 12:54.245
can replace the severed limb
of a soldier in minutes.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.448
With one 10 times stronger.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.602
Fully networked
to the soldier's biometrics

12:58.680 --> 13:00.523
and to his optical targeting system.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.444
If you want me to open up
Uncle Sam's checkbook,

13:03.520 --> 13:05.204
I'm gonna need specifics.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.726
Specifics. Specifically,

13:07.800 --> 13:10.326
I'd like to build
dozens of these machines.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.164
Increase the scale of our surgery wing.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.765
Crank out 100 soldiers a day.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.650
- To join our Special Ops units.
-No. To replace them.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.927
Navy Seals. Secret Service.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.490
No, gentlemen,

13:20.560 --> 13:23.325
we know the world's
a dangerous place now.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.041
What we're offering you is security.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.326
All right. What do we want?
There's a three-wheel over there.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.641
Here comes a Humvee
that has better fireworks.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.085
Hold on.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.924
Now that's what I'm talking about.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.526
You bring a noisemaker?

13:43.600 --> 13:46.922
Sir, I bring the noise
and the funk wherever I go.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.810
Hey-ho,
friends! The enemy approaches!

13:55.880 --> 13:57.450
Careful now, or they'll win the day!

13:57.520 --> 13:58.760
Move it. Over there!

14:00.720 --> 14:02.085
Hey!

14:27.760 --> 14:28.966
You know where to put this next one.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.127
Nice work, guys. The window's open.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.043
- Relax. Practice drills.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.168
The compound's secure.
You have nothing to worry about.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.686
Tell us what the hell
is going on out there,

14:45.760 --> 14:48.684
or you can kiss a government
contract goodbye.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.001
Gentlemen, please, I beg you...

14:51.080 --> 14:52.366
Don't beg them, Quinn.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.411
You're not a Rottweiler.
We don't need their scraps.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.720
Who the hell is this?

14:57.800 --> 15:01.009
This is our strategy consultant,
John Garrett.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.287
I want full disclosure right now,

15:03.360 --> 15:06.409
or our boys will come in
and shut you down.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.448
Why do I hear gunfire?

15:08.520 --> 15:11.126
It's the dying breath
of an old world, General.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.522
But a new world is coming.
I've tasted it on my tongue.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.162
This is your strategy consultant?

15:17.240 --> 15:19.083
He's part-time.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.207
New strategy.

15:20.280 --> 15:24.205
You shut your mouth
and give us everything we want.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.806
You threaten a United States General

15:26.880 --> 15:28.689
and there are consequences.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.127
Oh, you feel powerful now, don't you?

15:31.240 --> 15:34.050
But you're all just slaves
who will serve our future.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.288
Listen, you crazy son of a bitch...

15:36.360 --> 15:38.488
Gentlemen, perhaps a small
demonstration will...

15:38.560 --> 15:41.848
Yes. Oh, yes, a demonstration.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.844
I've seen the future.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.443
I've glimpsed it through
the eyes of every creature,

15:54.520 --> 15:56.761
dead, living, or yet to be.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.690
This is the beginning.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.125
The beginning of what, John?

16:10.280 --> 16:12.044
- The end.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.360
You're not going anywhere.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.966
You think you can steal
the Gravitonium?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.326
It was given to us.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.209
What the hell did you say to Garrett?

16:28.280 --> 16:29.327
I listened.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.323
He's psychotic. Did you notice that?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.402
I just had to lock up
six government officials

16:33.480 --> 16:35.403
because he butchered the seventh one.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.084
He completely lost it in there.

16:37.160 --> 16:40.209
You're wrong. Garrett's not lost.
Far from it. He's connected now.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.201
Don't tell me you're following him
into this madness?

16:43.280 --> 16:44.566
His talk of evolution?

16:44.640 --> 16:47.007
I agree with him.
You're the one who follows him.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.889
But in this case, you should.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.611
For the first time, you both need
the same thing, and so do I.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.605
What are you talking about?
I need him to get his head on straight.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.206
Skye. We need Skye.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.886
And that's all you ever wanted, isn't it?

17:00.960 --> 17:03.201
The evolution he speaks of?

17:03.280 --> 17:05.487
She'll be an important part of that.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.131
- So go get her, Grant Ward.
-Get her for what?

17:08.599 --> 17:11.171
The world is going to change.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.289
And when it does, she could be yours.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.560
Oh, you really are crazy.

17:17.680 --> 17:21.127
Skye detests me.
She thinks I'm a monster.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.770
Are you? Is that your true nature?

17:25.440 --> 17:28.250
Or is that what Garrett made you to be?

17:31.480 --> 17:32.527
I don't know.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.844
Well, we know about Skye's parents.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.809
About the darkness that lies inside her.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.644
I believe in a world where
her true nature will reveal itself.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.450
And when that day comes,

17:47.960 --> 17:50.486
maybe you two
could be monsters together.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.050
More on our six.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.122
Here they come.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.487
These windows can't take
many more hits like this, sir.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.561
Let's hope they don't have to.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.322
Coulson, we found the dealer.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.564
This is a bomb. You know what those do.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.290
And you've seen Agent May here

18:29.600 --> 18:30.886
through the eyes of your super-soldiers.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.203
So, you know what she does. You
don't wanna mess with us, is my point.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.806
You're not gonna be able
to hijack our soldiers.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.804
We've thought through
every emergency scenario.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.405
Including this one.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.848
Don't tell me you just switched
the soldiers to default directive?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.001
Yeah. I did.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.170
And how did you know about that?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.567
- Time for the guns?
-Time for the guns.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.365
Stay.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.571
Stay.-

19:05.400 --> 19:06.526
Good boy.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.565
They're off to defend Garrett.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.324
And lead me right to him.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.687
Now that we're inside,
go contact Armed Forces.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.326
And make some noise
on the way out. Trip.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.324
If the rest of us don't make it,
I still want this place to burn.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.609
- I prefer you make it, sir.
-Me, too.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.970
The compound's been hit.
Raina and Quinn took off.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.247
We need to take action now.
What are my orders?

19:40.320 --> 19:41.970
That's up to you, son.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.690
Wake up!

19:43.760 --> 19:47.526
Come back to reality, John.
What do you need me to do?

19:47.600 --> 19:49.125
You've already done it.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.446
It's your handler.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.602
Probably to tell me
what the soldiers are seeing.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.444
- Yeah?
-Hi, John.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.329
Just calling to catch up.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.606
Skye.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.730
You sound different
on the phone. Huskier.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.326
You curious why I'm calling
from your soldier control center?

20:07.400 --> 20:09.129
No, I'm not too concerned.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.362
You see, if anyone
but the assigned handler

20:11.480 --> 20:13.881
gives a directive to
one of my men, well... Kaboom.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.804
Ah, darn it. Coulson didn't think of that.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.644
You outsmarted us again.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.643
Phil's around? Great.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.609
We actually have a lot to talk about.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.162
Oh, and I wanted you to know,
your scientist friends?

20:27.640 --> 20:29.847
They were brave until their last breath.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.766
Raina told me how special Skye is.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.008
I know you've seen that from the start.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.970
You want orders? Get her.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.886
Thank you.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.365
He's always been a tender heart.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.769
You don't need to be set to default.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.968
You haven't left me alone all day.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.008
I was told to never leave your side, sir.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.650
I love you, too.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.085
All right, we need to hurry.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.924
We have to do this soon.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.241
- There has to be enough...
-Oxygen to ignite, yes.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.367
Yeah.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.447
Good. Okay.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.488
When I press that power button...

21:14.560 --> 21:16.289
The window will blow in,
and water will rush in at once.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.603
Yeah, which is gonna be like 100
punches to the stomach, okay?

21:19.680 --> 21:21.808
The Wind's gonna be
knocked right out of us.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.120
This is near empty,

21:23.200 --> 21:25.362
but I've rigged it to let out
a burst of very high pressure.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.885
It should force a breath into your lungs,

21:26.960 --> 21:28.724
but you have to hold on to it, okay?
Hold on tight.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.087
Should be enough to get you
up the 90 feet or so.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.400
One breath? But there's two of us.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.204
Yeah, I've done the math.

21:34.280 --> 21:37.409
That's why you're taking it.
You're a better swimmer anyway.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.608
- No.
-Jemma...

21:39.680 --> 21:42.809
No, I'm not leaving you here.
That's ridiculous. We need a new plan.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.805
We're not discussing it, okay?
You're taking it. End of story.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.370
I couldn't live if you didn't.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.250
I feel the same way.
There has to be another way.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.367
You're taking it.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.011
Why would you make me do this?
You're my best friend in the world!

21:55.080 --> 21:58.084
Yeah, and you're more than that,
Jemma.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.485
I couldn't find the courage to tell you.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.410
So please.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.528
Let me show you.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.844
-it's okay.
-No. No.

22:30.080 --> 22:33.448
Jemma, Jemma, we have to hurry.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.924
- No! No!

22:38.120 --> 22:41.886
- Take it, Jemma. Take it.
-No! No!

22:48.160 --> 22:49.207
No!

23:25.520 --> 23:26.646
Help!

23:55.840 --> 23:59.367
You're in decompression.
On a jet back to the mainland.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.644
They told us you were dead.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.291
Good. We want word
to get around on that.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.928
- Fitz.
-Easy. Easy.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.966
His heart's still beating. Just barely.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.963
I have a full med team with him.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.850
But you have to remain
in this chamber, okay?

24:15.920 --> 24:20.244
His brain was without oxygen for
a long time. But you saved him.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.726
It was the other way around.
How did you find us?

24:24.800 --> 24:27.770
That makeshift beacon of yours.
Good thinking.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.684
Led us right to you.
Lucky we were looking.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.286
- You were looking?
-For my man, Coulson.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.045
I understand
you were involved in a dispute

24:36.160 --> 24:38.242
I might wanna weigh in on.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.130
You have anything that
might lead me to him?

24:42.880 --> 24:45.690
Looks like the back entrance
to the factory floor is on the south side.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.886
Roger that.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.531
I have to hit snooze on this every minute

24:49.600 --> 24:50.681
to keep that from blowing.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.326
I will die before talking.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.845
But there's nothing to tell.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.206
There's no way of controlling
the soldiers

24:56.280 --> 24:58.009
unless there's an actual handler
at the machine.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.127
I'm not interested in that.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.406
I'm more interested in why
you're willing to die for HYDRA.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.045
Are you a true believer?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.964
Is HYDRA the plucky little
family you never had?

25:07.040 --> 25:10.089
Or are you here because
of the Incentives Program?

25:12.120 --> 25:15.203
She's not gonna kill you.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.011
She had a chance to kill me before
and couldn't do it.

25:18.120 --> 25:21.363
And she hates me. A lot.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.169
I feel sorry for you.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.490
Betraying the only people
who gave you a chance

25:25.560 --> 25:28.040
at being a decent human being.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.451
Fitz was a hero because

25:29.520 --> 25:32.126
he still wanted to give you
that chance, after everything.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.881
But some people
are just born evil, I guess.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.440
Yeah. Yeah, maybe they are.

25:39.440 --> 25:43.001
I've learned things about you,
Skye. History.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.766
Things you'll wanna know.
You and I aren't that different.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.207
You're not the evil
I was referring to.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.682
Garrett is evil, you're just weak.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.330
Doing anything you're told.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.721
I hope Garrett orders you
to walk into traffic.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.325
You're right, Skye.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.961
You woke up a weakness inside me.

26:02.960 --> 26:07.170
For the first time in a while,
I wanted something for myself.

26:08.920 --> 26:11.571
Maybe I'll just take what I want.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.564
Wake up something inside of you.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.884
I'm not afraid of you, Ward.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.440
You're not gonna kill us with the bomb.
You'd go, too.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.251
No. I have a weapon
much better than a bomb

26:22.320 --> 26:24.527
that will absolutely destroy you.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.881
Why's that?

26:27.520 --> 26:30.171
Because you slept with her
and she's really pissed off.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.491
Let's talk about Incentives.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.285
Now, you said our thing
was no strings attached.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.603
Looks to me like the ice queen
got her feelings hurt.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.964
Hey-ho,
friends! The enemy approaches!

27:05.040 --> 27:07.566
- Careful now, or they'll win the day.
-Check the perimeter.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.445
Hi, John.

27:11.560 --> 27:12.766
Hi, Phil.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.285
Well, that's new.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.925
Sir?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.008
You don't have to call me "sir," Coulson.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.401
Look at me. I'm dressed like
I live under a bridge.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.925
What are you doing here?

27:34.000 --> 27:37.766
Simmons turned me on to that
old-timey tracker Fitz left on your bus.

27:40.920 --> 27:44.288
I went to great pains to make sure
you didn't die the first time.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.330
Well, now's probably not the best time,

27:48.440 --> 27:50.727
but I'd like to have a lengthy
conversation with you about that.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.121
--it might get loud.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.441
And I owe you that, but right now,

27:55.520 --> 27:57.921
we owe Garrett a punch in the teeth.
Wouldn't you say?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.209
This packs a pretty good punch.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.284
--I know what it does.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.124
- Reminds me of the old days.
-You were never on top.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.322
We're running out of time.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.369
Tell the man what they have on you.

28:55.440 --> 28:59.081
Fury. Well, hell.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.562
When was the last time anyone saw

29:01.640 --> 29:04.530
a tag-team wrestling match
with four dead guys?

29:05.880 --> 29:08.611
I only see one dead guy in here.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.127
Oh, the power is all on this side
of the room, fellas.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.806
Phil, I'm surprised
you'd try and stop me.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.962
Of course, I don't blame you, Nick.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.169
You haven't seen
the big picture, the big bang.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.969
The timeless frozen ocean.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.849
But Phil here has.

29:23.920 --> 29:27.606
We share a bond. We're blood brothers.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.760
You didn't tell me he'd gone this crazy.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.524
He's really stepped it up a notch.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.200
Wait, May.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.770
I think I've waited long enough for this.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.884
Kyle?

30:13.960 --> 30:16.088
On, baby!

30:18.000 --> 30:20.082
I'm so sorry what they did to you.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.250
What are you looking for?

30:27.760 --> 30:29.250
Our Ace in the hole.

30:29.320 --> 30:32.051
You remember that speech
you used to give us, Nick?

30:32.120 --> 30:34.088
About how one man
can accomplish anything

30:34.160 --> 30:36.242
once he realizes he can be
something bigger?

30:36.920 --> 30:39.127
Well, now I am.

30:40.160 --> 30:43.323
A part. A part of something bigger.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.685
Is that how it went?

30:45.760 --> 30:47.046
Not a great listener.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.805
If you tell me this whole
HYDRA path thing you took

30:49.880 --> 30:51.928
is because you misheard
my damn one-man speech...

30:52.000 --> 30:55.129
I am the key to the future of the universe.
I'm the origin of all things...

30:55.200 --> 30:58.841
- You got it, right?
-Totally. Loud and clear.

31:05.800 --> 31:06.847
Just one second.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.127
Come on. Please. I just...

31:10.880 --> 31:11.961
Aw, man.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.087
Here. Okay, Ace.

31:16.160 --> 31:19.243
I need you to give me a message, okay?

31:19.320 --> 31:21.846
Something your father would know
could only come from you.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.084
I need to prove I have you.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.810
It won't matter. I've already told you,

31:25.880 --> 31:28.281
there's no way to communicate
with Deathlok from in here.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.883
I don't need to.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.123
I've been communicating with him
the whole time.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.567
Fury was teaching us something
you didn't wanna hear, John.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.529
Because you only think about yourself.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.126
That's the difference
between your side and our side.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.089
And why we're always gonna win.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.925
What lesson, Phil?
Please, enlighten me.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.170
You can't do this, Mike.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.842
I order you to stand down.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.844
You must obey me.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.281
You need me to translate
the words of creation.

32:16.680 --> 32:20.207
You don't wanna do this, Mike.
Tell him, Phil!

32:22.200 --> 32:24.601
Mr. Peterson's free to do
whatever he wants.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.442
Think he learned his lesson?

32:34.520 --> 32:36.090
He learned something.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.971
Without regular injections,
they're just men.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.122
Once doctors remove
their cybernetic eyes,

32:52.240 --> 32:54.242
they'll be essentially back to normal.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.163
Minus an eye, of course.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.928
You got a chance to express
all your feelings?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.405
Is he still breathing?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.323
I guess she kept some of it to herself.

33:06.280 --> 33:10.080
He's having trouble speaking.
I think I fractured his larynx.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.241
Oh, good.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.924
Your attempt to cross off
Fitz and Simmons failed.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.241
But Fitz may never be the same again.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.971
So, I'm gonna invent new ways
to ruin the rest of your life.

33:22.040 --> 33:24.725
And we'll do whatever's necessary
to get HYDRA intel from you,

33:24.800 --> 33:27.963
but your torture?
That's gonna be internal.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.089
- And a little bit external.
-Sure, some of that.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.690
But you devoted your entire life
to a deranged narcissist

33:34.760 --> 33:37.684
who never gave a damn
about anyone, and now he's dead.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.046
And you've got the rest of your life

33:39.160 --> 33:42.721
to wrestle with the question,
"Who are you without him?"

33:57.440 --> 33:59.442
Why don't you go to him?

34:00.280 --> 34:02.647
I don't want him to see what I've become.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.688
He won't care about your burns.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.650
That's not what I mean.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.129
Coulson said to bring you in.

34:12.199 --> 34:15.443
You can access my hardware
and watch my every move.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.045
Go ahead.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.964
I'll only be making amends
for my actions.

34:20.880 --> 34:24.487
Whatever you did, you did it for Ace.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.719
And what I do now,

34:28.639 --> 34:30.722
that'll be for him, too.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.042
There's a reason why they say,
"Cut off the head."

35:36.200 --> 35:39.090
Now, I'll be unstop...

35:42.400 --> 35:45.085
Hey. guys! I found it!

35:46.400 --> 35:48.528
I told you it would be in here.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.527
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
And cruel. And very stupid.

35:56.600 --> 35:57.840
I think you've made your point.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.490
Why bring me back in the first place?

35:59.560 --> 36:01.324
Clearly, I didn't think
it was the best idea.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.368
I warned you about
people losing their minds.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.887
Agent May was on top of the situation.
She says you're fine.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.086
Aren't you?

36:08.920 --> 36:11.605
It was a "break glass
in case of emergency" situation.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.761
Yes, but that emergency

36:12.840 --> 36:14.569
was supposed to be
the fall of an Avenger.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.927
Exactly.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.762
And I'm damn glad I did it, too.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.844
When you wanna build something,
you need a strong foundation.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.002
Now, you know
how few people I trust, Coulson.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.610
You can count them on one hand.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.682
And I'm not afraid to cut off fingers.

36:29.760 --> 36:32.843
The principle S.H.I.E.L.D.
was founded upon was pure.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.166
Protection.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.967
"Protection." One word.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.042
Sometimes to protect one man
against himself.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.009
Other times to protect the planet

36:42.080 --> 36:45.004
against an alien invasion
from another universe.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.371
- It's a broad job description.
-No need to tell me.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.205
But the belief
that drives us all is the same,

36:51.280 --> 36:53.760
whether it's one man or all mankind.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.285
That they're worth saving.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.490
That truth lives inside you, Coulson.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.405
Before it was torn apart,

37:04.480 --> 37:07.324
S.H.I.E.L.D. was a lot of moving parts.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.323
But guys like you were the heart.

37:10.640 --> 37:11.641
Now...

37:12.880 --> 37:15.042
You'll be the head.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.881
What is it?

37:18.960 --> 37:21.645
A toolbox. To help you build it back up.

37:23.920 --> 37:27.242
You want me to start over?
Rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D.?

37:27.320 --> 37:32.360
From scratch. Take your time.
And do it right.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.889
You'll still have his back?

37:35.960 --> 37:37.325
Of course.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.567
There's no one else I trust with this.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.688
Thank you, sir.

37:44.400 --> 37:48.007
How do you... How should I proceed?

37:49.400 --> 37:50.925
That's up to you,

37:51.920 --> 37:53.046
Director.

38:02.120 --> 38:05.044
And you, sir?
Where are you heading now?

38:05.800 --> 38:07.962
I'm trading in my bird's-eye view

38:08.040 --> 38:10.008
for two solid feet on the ground.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.890
This is the last time
you'll be seeing me for a stretch.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.806
You're gonna disappear.
Nowhere to be found.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.120
Nowhere?

38:19.640 --> 38:22.041
You know me better than that, Phil.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.801
I'll be everywhere.

38:53.080 --> 38:57.802
Fitz? Is he okay?
Please tell me he's okay.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.646
He's alive.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.683
What is this place?

39:06.520 --> 39:09.603
First thing I found in that box
was these coordinates.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.966
Another secret base?

39:11.040 --> 39:12.610
I call it the Playground.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.682
Although, technically,
it doesn't have a name

39:14.760 --> 39:16.888
because, technically, it doesn't exist.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.287
It being a secret base and all.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.167
Eric?

39:21.240 --> 39:24.449
Billy Koenig, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.887
Although I totally understand
the confusion.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.123
Eric passed away, sadly.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.885
But it's great to have company, finally.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.281
And I did not mind minding this place.

39:36.880 --> 39:37.927
Agent Coulson.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.130
I know, I know. And it is
an honor to meet you, sir.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.043
I'll get your lanyard shortly.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.201
For the rest of you,

39:45.320 --> 39:48.608
lanyards will be handed out
on a case-by-case basis.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.806
Can't be too careful

39:49.880 --> 39:52.406
with all those HYDRA threats
still out there causing trouble.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.721
That's why we're here.
Get you up and running,

39:54.800 --> 39:57.883
and back fighting the good fight,
which is gonna be cool.

39:57.960 --> 40:02.204
I know we don't have much,
but what we have is yours, sir.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.047
Thank you.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.001
So...

40:08.200 --> 40:10.851
Where would you like to start?

40:43.840 --> 40:46.969
I know you thought
you'd never see me again,

40:58.560 --> 41:00.210
but I found your daughter.
