02:39.592 --> 02:40.756
All right.
Off you go.

02:40.757 --> 02:41.892
Happy Christmas, teacher!

02:41.893 --> 02:44.227
- Happy new year.
- Thank you, Dave.

02:44.228 --> 02:45.728
Give my love to your
girlfriend in Sydney, sir.

02:45.729 --> 02:47.697
I'll do that, sir, thank you.

02:47.698 --> 02:49.266
Have a happy holiday, sir.

02:49.267 --> 02:51.535
And you, Chris, thank you.
Enjoy yourself.

02:51.536 --> 02:52.903
For your collection, sir.

02:52.904 --> 02:54.225
Thank you very much, Lou.
Bye-bye.

02:56.842 --> 02:58.911
So I'll see you
next year, mate.

06:17.442 --> 06:18.851
Shut up!

06:28.120 --> 06:29.610
A middy, please, Charlie.

06:51.610 --> 06:52.877
Having one yourself?

06:52.878 --> 06:53.899
Yeah.

07:14.899 --> 07:15.799
You've, uh,

07:17.168 --> 07:18.870
got snakes in your
pocket, have you?

07:27.079 --> 07:28.081
Mmm...

07:29.081 --> 07:29.981
Keys.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.531
Will you be wanting your
room when you come back?

07:45.531 --> 07:46.598
Where else would I stay?

07:59.877 --> 08:01.946
But if you get

08:01.947 --> 08:03.680
a flood of tourists
or anything, Charlie,

08:03.681 --> 08:05.121
I can always stay
in the schoolhouse.

08:24.101 --> 08:25.572
See you in six weeks, huh?

08:27.572 --> 08:28.608
Not if I can rob a bank.

08:30.608 --> 08:32.979
- Sure, Ned Kelly.
- Mmm.

08:37.916 --> 08:38.982
See you, then.

08:38.984 --> 08:39.884
Uh-huh.

09:20.225 --> 09:22.627
Excuse me, please.

09:22.628 --> 09:23.327
Oi, fella, come and
have a beer with us.

09:23.328 --> 09:25.229
No. No, thanks.

09:25.230 --> 09:26.430
Come on, come and have a beer.

11:16.741 --> 11:17.743
New to the yabba?

11:17.744 --> 11:18.644
Yes.

11:19.410 --> 11:20.346
Staying long?

11:21.346 --> 11:22.779
No, just tonight.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.882
Oh, that's hard luck.

11:24.883 --> 11:27.320
Want to see a bit more
of the yabba than that.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.052
You think it's worth seeing?

11:30.053 --> 11:31.787
It's the
best place in Australia.

11:31.788 --> 11:33.325
Everybody likes the yabba.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.427
Why?

11:35.427 --> 11:37.529
Well, it's a friendly place.

11:38.529 --> 11:42.298
Nobody worries who you are
or where you come from.

11:42.299 --> 11:44.659
You're a good bloke, you're all right.
You know what I mean?

11:58.216 --> 12:00.350
Excuse me.

12:00.351 --> 12:03.457
Do you have a room for John grant?
I made a booking by letter.

12:06.457 --> 12:07.924
Oh, I'm only staying the night.

12:07.925 --> 12:09.325
I'm flying to
Sydney in the morning.

12:09.494 --> 12:10.929
You have to pay now.

12:11.929 --> 12:13.496
I think we can manage that.

12:13.497 --> 12:14.397
It'll be $4.

12:28.245 --> 12:30.547
There's $1 deposit on the keys.

12:30.548 --> 12:32.508
You'll get that back when
you bring the keys back.

12:33.217 --> 12:34.961
Thank you.

12:42.961 --> 12:45.128
Could you tell me where
room seven is, please?

12:45.129 --> 12:47.610
Up the steps and down
the corridor to the right.

13:06.884 --> 13:08.164
Hey. Shut it, mate.
We're closed.

13:51.028 --> 13:51.928
Excuse me.

14:25.663 --> 14:28.364
You're new to the yabba?

14:28.365 --> 14:29.464
Well, I just dropped
in for the night.

14:29.465 --> 14:30.534
I'm flying to
Sydney in the morning.

14:30.535 --> 14:31.701
Uh-huh.

14:31.702 --> 14:34.238
- Come far?
- Tiboonda.

14:34.239 --> 14:35.341
Ah, nice little place.

14:36.341 --> 14:37.541
Do you like it?

14:37.542 --> 14:38.610
Paradise on earth.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.278
Yeah.

14:41.279 --> 14:43.314
What do you do out there?

14:43.315 --> 14:45.985
Oh, I'm a bonded slave of
the education department.

14:47.985 --> 14:49.354
I'm a school teacher.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.354
Oh, yes.

14:51.355 --> 14:53.388
You took over from old
Murchison, didn't you?

14:53.389 --> 14:54.623
McDonald, his name is.

14:54.624 --> 14:56.096
Of course.
And you're, uh...

14:59.096 --> 15:00.630
Grant.

15:00.631 --> 15:02.499
Yeah, that's right.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.470
Well, I'll be blown.
Crawford's the name.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.370
Jock Crawford.

15:07.371 --> 15:08.571
John grant.

15:08.572 --> 15:11.515
I'm pleased to know you, Jack.
What about another beer?

15:18.515 --> 15:19.672
Thanks, Mr. Crawford.

15:40.672 --> 15:42.472
- Here you are, Jack.
- Thanks.

15:42.473 --> 15:43.373
You, uh...

15:45.076 --> 15:47.076
You say you're a slave.

15:47.077 --> 15:49.312
What do you mean by that?

15:49.313 --> 15:51.314
You wouldn't know how our
educational authorities

15:51.315 --> 15:52.475
get teachers for the outback?

15:53.018 --> 15:55.418
Wouldn't have a clue, mate.

15:55.419 --> 15:59.623
Now, a new teacher has
to post a bond for $1,000.

15:59.624 --> 16:01.393
That 1,000 guarantees you'll
serve out your contract

16:01.394 --> 16:04.561
wherever they send you.

16:04.562 --> 16:08.699
Oh, well. I suppose they
know what they're doing.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.803
You clever blokes never like to
stop in the one spot long, do you?

16:12.803 --> 16:14.803
Depends on the place.

16:15.373 --> 16:17.106
Yeah, that's right.

16:17.107 --> 16:19.442
Well, never mind, Jack.

16:19.443 --> 16:21.443
You can always come to the
yabba for your holidays.

16:21.446 --> 16:23.513
Good luck.

16:23.514 --> 16:25.129
Yes, that's something
to look forward to.

16:38.129 --> 16:39.450
No, thanks,
I'll be running along.

16:58.115 --> 17:00.184
Police have much to
do in Bundanyabba?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.786
No. No, not really.

17:02.787 --> 17:04.854
We sort of...

17:04.855 --> 17:07.825
We just sort of
keep an eye on things.

17:07.826 --> 17:09.786
Honestest little town in
Australia, this is, mate.

17:11.194 --> 17:13.563
But, mind you,
there are not too many

17:13.564 --> 17:16.231
game enough to try
anything around here.

17:16.232 --> 17:19.105
You see, we're so isolated,
there's nowhere to go.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.638
We get 'em, and quick.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.642
Sounds like an easy life.

17:24.642 --> 17:25.711
Yeah, not bad.

17:27.711 --> 17:29.414
Of course,
we do have a few suicides.

17:30.414 --> 17:31.781
Yeah?

17:31.782 --> 17:33.262
Yeah. Yeah,
they reckon it's the heat.

17:35.119 --> 17:37.756
Me...
I like the heat.

17:38.756 --> 17:40.692
Yeah, it's one way of
getting out of town.

17:41.692 --> 17:42.728
What is?

17:43.728 --> 17:44.628
Killing yourself.

17:49.467 --> 17:52.804
Hey, that's good. I like a
bloke with a sense of humor.

17:54.172 --> 17:55.819
Oh... killing yourself.

18:08.819 --> 18:09.719
Two more, Kate.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.161
Have you ever
been anywhere else?

18:19.162 --> 18:20.922
Yeah. Did three months'
training in the city.

18:26.637 --> 18:27.709
Didn't like it.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.643
A couple more?

18:33.644 --> 18:35.848
Here, give us your dough.
I'll get 'em quicker than you.

18:37.848 --> 18:40.918
<i>♪ The one foggy Christmas Eve</i>

18:40.919 --> 18:44.621
<i>♪ Santa came to say</i>

18:44.622 --> 18:48.325
<i>♪ Rudolph,
with your nose so bright</i>

18:48.326 --> 18:51.295
<i>♪ won't you guide
my sleigh tonight?</i>

18:51.296 --> 18:52.963
<i>♪ Then all the reindeer
loved him ♪</i>

19:00.204 --> 19:03.774
Here you are. I slung your
change to the steward.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.709
Told him it was yours.

19:05.710 --> 19:07.511
Do you a bit of good
when you come back again.

19:14.852 --> 19:15.923
Get up, get up.

19:19.923 --> 19:22.291
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:22.292 --> 19:24.564
<i>let us pay a tribute
to our fallen comrades.</i>

19:26.564 --> 19:30.901
<i>They shall grow not old,
as we that are left grow old.</i>

19:30.902 --> 19:34.971
<i>Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.</i>

19:34.972 --> 19:37.773
<i>At the going down of the sun,
and in the morning,</i>

19:37.774 --> 19:38.695
<i>we will remember them.</i>

19:40.244 --> 19:41.555
We will remember them.

19:50.555 --> 19:51.822
<i>Lest we forget.</i>

19:51.823 --> 19:53.824
Lest we forget.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.146
<i>Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

20:07.005 --> 20:09.842
No, as long as they close before
the show, they're shut...

20:12.309 --> 20:14.610
Come on, the beer's
real good here.

20:14.611 --> 20:17.979
Oh, no, jock. No, I'll pass
out if I don't eat soon.

20:17.980 --> 20:20.050
Well, it's easy to see
you're not a yabba man.

20:20.051 --> 20:22.318
A yabba man!

20:22.319 --> 20:24.824
A yabba man...
You're the yabba man, jock.

20:26.824 --> 20:28.625
The Bundanyabba man.

20:30.961 --> 20:33.697
All right, all right.

20:33.698 --> 20:36.018
Come on, I'll show you where
you can get a real good steak.

20:37.835 --> 20:40.702
This is a mate of mine, John grant.
You can let him in anytime.

20:40.703 --> 20:41.603
He's all right.

20:43.340 --> 20:44.774
How's it going there, jock?

20:44.775 --> 20:46.344
Oh, not too bad, Jim.
How's it with you?

20:46.345 --> 20:47.952
Great.

20:55.952 --> 20:58.921
Hey, Joe. Put a steak on
for me mate, will you?

20:58.922 --> 21:00.863
Yeah, lovely. Hey, Tim.
One steak, mate.

21:05.863 --> 21:06.864
Oh, rare, please.

21:06.865 --> 21:07.998
Yeah, all right.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.766
How's the missus?

21:09.767 --> 21:11.734
Oh, she was a bit crook last week.
She all right now, jock.

21:11.735 --> 21:13.175
- And the kid?
- Oh, this kid's gold.

21:14.005 --> 21:15.440
You tell him to stop missing
school or I'll have you.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.808
All right, mate.

21:17.808 --> 21:18.711
Come on, I'll show you
inside while we're waiting.

21:19.711 --> 21:20.611
All right.

21:21.011 --> 21:23.347
Biggest two-up game
in Australia, Jack.

21:30.121 --> 21:32.822
Right on, fellas.
I want 100 in the middle.

21:32.823 --> 21:34.358
The spinner's
the bloke with the kip.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.925
Kip?

21:35.926 --> 21:37.426
Yeah, the bit of wood
they put the pennies on.

21:37.427 --> 21:39.995
He's just dropped
$100 in the center.

21:39.996 --> 21:42.364
That's got to be covered
before they can spin 'em.

21:42.365 --> 21:44.646
Now it's been covered, they can
all get in for a side bet.

21:53.411 --> 21:54.911
Heads, heads, heads...

21:54.912 --> 21:56.484
Tails. Tails.

22:00.484 --> 22:03.385
- Who wants to go on the heads?
- Put 50 on heads.

22:03.386 --> 22:06.154
You know, the little fella with the
kip's a fella named Charlie Jones.

22:06.155 --> 22:08.235
Comes in here every Friday
night with his pay packet.

22:11.395 --> 22:12.295
Bets are closing.

22:13.163 --> 22:14.433
Clear a space.

22:16.433 --> 22:18.435
Quiet! Hey!

22:20.938 --> 22:22.898
Settle down, settle down.
What do you think it is?

22:23.708 --> 22:24.816
Fair go, chaps.

22:31.816 --> 22:32.950
Heads!

22:39.790 --> 22:42.092
Do you get the idea now, Jack?

22:42.093 --> 22:44.494
Well, you just bet on whether the
pennies come down heads or tails.

22:44.495 --> 22:45.829
Yeah, that's right.

22:47.832 --> 22:48.930
You think this
crowd will be at each

22:48.931 --> 22:49.967
other's throats
when they settle?

22:49.968 --> 22:52.536
Ah, there's hardly a fight.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.438
Each man knows what's coming to
him, he just goes and gets it.

22:55.439 --> 22:56.442
Heads, heads, heads...

22:57.442 --> 22:59.442
Tails, tails, tails...

22:59.443 --> 23:00.343
Sixty on tails...

23:05.482 --> 23:06.382
Fair go.

23:13.124 --> 23:14.024
Watch your feet now.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.826
Watch yourself there.

23:16.827 --> 23:18.894
Wait for it. Wait for it now.

23:18.895 --> 23:19.795
Heads!

23:32.009 --> 23:33.243
Four hundred, Charlie,
what do you wanna do?

23:33.244 --> 23:34.877
Put the lot on.

23:34.878 --> 23:37.549
Yeah, Charlie always
goes for 800 or bust.

23:39.549 --> 23:41.917
You gotta throw four heads
in a row to do it, too.

23:41.918 --> 23:43.117
Come on now, hurry up.
Get 'em on.

23:43.118 --> 23:44.823
And what does he do
with the winnings?

23:45.823 --> 23:46.861
Well, nothing.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.094
Simmer down, boys.

23:51.095 --> 23:52.496
Settle down.

23:52.497 --> 23:53.996
Put 'em on,
Charlie, now, come on.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.163
When you're ready, Charles.

23:55.164 --> 23:56.267
When you're ready.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.168
Fair go.

23:58.035 --> 23:58.940
Fair go.

24:02.940 --> 24:03.881
Heads.

24:09.881 --> 24:10.823
Beauty, Charlie.

24:18.823 --> 24:20.184
You're casting
a spell around here.

24:21.558 --> 24:23.061
There's a nice
simple-minded game.

24:25.061 --> 24:26.297
My steak's probably ready.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.932
Yeah, come on.

24:28.932 --> 24:30.452
Here you are.
That'll be a dollar, son.

24:35.205 --> 24:37.141
There's a clean
place here, Jack.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.046
Oh.

24:42.046 --> 24:44.145
Well, I'll have to
be pushing along.

24:44.146 --> 24:45.883
Oh, thanks, jock. Thanks
for showing me around.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.618
Oh, that's all right.

24:48.618 --> 24:50.286
And that'll be
the best dollar's worth

24:50.287 --> 24:51.727
you'll ever have
in your life, Matey.

24:56.093 --> 24:57.654
All the little devils
are proud of hell.

25:00.064 --> 25:01.231
Two heads.

25:08.271 --> 25:10.338
Do you mean you
don't think the yabba

25:10.339 --> 25:11.819
is the greatest
little place on earth?

25:13.711 --> 25:14.611
It could be worse.

25:15.145 --> 25:16.045
How?

25:18.182 --> 25:19.628
The supply of
beer could run out.

25:31.628 --> 25:33.597
Hey, aren't you
going to eat that?

25:33.598 --> 25:34.498
No.

25:50.146 --> 25:51.281
Why did you say that?

25:51.282 --> 25:53.182
Say what?

25:53.183 --> 25:54.953
Well, about them
being proud of hell.

25:56.953 --> 25:58.554
Discontent is a luxury
of the well-to-do.

26:00.357 --> 26:02.329
If you gotta live here,
you might as well like it.

26:06.329 --> 26:07.765
Why don't you like Crawford?

26:07.766 --> 26:09.234
Jock?

26:11.234 --> 26:13.239
The touch of his
hairy hand offends you.

26:15.239 --> 26:18.306
I'm just bored with it.
The aggressive hospitality,

26:18.307 --> 26:20.174
the arrogance of stupid people

26:20.175 --> 26:22.016
who insist you should be
as stupid as they are.

26:23.047 --> 26:24.168
It's death to farm out here.

26:27.018 --> 26:28.379
It's worse than
death in the mines.

26:30.954 --> 26:32.474
Do you want them to
sing opera as well?

26:37.294 --> 26:38.194
And what do you do?

26:41.164 --> 26:42.173
I drink.

26:49.173 --> 26:50.376
This beer's gone warm.

26:53.376 --> 26:54.450
I...

26:59.450 --> 27:01.450
Heads.

27:04.020 --> 27:04.920
Here you are, doc.

27:05.756 --> 27:06.656
Thanks, Joe.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.159
It's a spinner's night,
nearly two-to-one on heads.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.228
Good on you, doc.

27:11.229 --> 27:14.250
Good on you... mate.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.450
You want to bet on tails, son?

27:39.390 --> 27:41.310
Fifty for the guy in the
jacket over there, slim.

27:47.397 --> 27:48.297
Fair go.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.473
When you're ready there, Brian.

27:53.404 --> 27:56.142
No betting when I say fair go.
Fair go, Brian.

27:58.142 --> 27:59.511
Fair go.

28:01.511 --> 28:02.411
Two tails!

28:14.057 --> 28:15.824
Anybody seen
a bloke with a coat on?

28:15.825 --> 28:17.428
Where's that bloke in a coat?

28:17.429 --> 28:19.165
Here! Here.

28:22.165 --> 28:23.769
Thought I lost you, mate.

28:25.769 --> 28:26.669
Move over!

28:28.305 --> 28:29.772
Sit down here, son.

28:29.773 --> 28:31.540
How many heads up?

28:31.541 --> 28:33.176
Heads, heads! I bet on heads.

28:33.177 --> 28:35.210
Anyone betting on tails?

28:35.211 --> 28:36.211
No, on heads.

28:36.212 --> 28:37.313
Tails, 100!

28:37.314 --> 28:38.547
You're covered!

28:38.548 --> 28:40.184
- A hundred for you?
- Yes.

28:41.184 --> 28:42.084
You're on a head.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.257
Anymore tails?

28:46.257 --> 28:48.017
Will you place your bets
and take your seats?

28:54.097 --> 28:54.997
Sorry, son.

28:55.465 --> 28:56.867
Be quiet!

29:00.171 --> 29:01.171
When you're ready for it.

29:01.538 --> 29:02.438
Fair go.

29:04.107 --> 29:05.007
They're up!

29:07.411 --> 29:08.916
- Play for now.
- Hold it!

29:12.916 --> 29:14.861
- Heads!
- All right.

29:23.861 --> 29:25.059
When you're ready.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.933
Don't forget, every Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday night!

29:29.933 --> 29:31.173
Early start
Christmas Eve, boys!

29:33.170 --> 29:34.610
Bring your own money,
anybody's girl.

29:36.606 --> 29:37.806
Leaving it all on heads, mate?

29:40.344 --> 29:41.244
Two hundred on tails.

29:41.511 --> 29:42.845
I'll have 100.

29:42.846 --> 29:43.849
You're on.

29:45.849 --> 29:47.351
- What are you backing, mate?
- Tails.

29:47.352 --> 29:48.553
You're set.

29:49.553 --> 29:51.294
I'll back a head.
I'll back... you're up?

29:57.294 --> 29:58.262
Thanks, mate.

29:59.262 --> 30:01.364
You're too noisy!

30:01.365 --> 30:02.872
Fair go, spinner.
When you're ready.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.577
One of each,
which is no result.

30:14.577 --> 30:15.579
Fair go.

30:16.579 --> 30:17.922
Fair go!

30:24.922 --> 30:25.822
Tails, they are!

30:41.505 --> 30:42.608
Whoo!

31:58.648 --> 31:59.548
$1,000.

32:01.085 --> 32:01.985
Just...

32:03.386 --> 32:04.423
Just one more spin,

32:06.423 --> 32:07.327
and you're out of it.

32:10.327 --> 32:11.227
Out of teaching.

32:14.999 --> 32:15.899
Out of Tiboonda.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.076
Toss? Toss?

32:26.076 --> 32:28.344
Toss? Toss?

32:28.345 --> 32:29.578
Who wants to toss?

32:29.579 --> 32:31.114
Yes!

32:31.115 --> 32:32.392
Here you are, son.

32:41.392 --> 32:42.392
How much you tossing for?

32:47.030 --> 32:48.765
$400 on tails.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.565
You can't spin for tails, mate.

32:50.566 --> 32:51.927
The spinner always
spins for heads.

32:53.103 --> 32:54.105
- Heads.
- On a head.

32:55.105 --> 32:56.473
Four hundred, Charlie.

33:10.686 --> 33:12.847
Watch out, imbecile! Watch
where you're going, you mug.

33:18.662 --> 33:19.562
When you're right now.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.433
Come on,
out of the ring, you blokes.

33:25.434 --> 33:26.334
Fair go, son.

33:29.205 --> 33:30.545
Heads.

33:34.545 --> 33:35.548
Settle down!

33:37.548 --> 33:39.180
No, son. You gotta put 'em
above your head and spin it.

33:39.181 --> 33:40.220
- All right?
- I'm sorry.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.756
When you're right now.

33:45.756 --> 33:46.656
Wait for it now.

33:49.159 --> 33:50.393
When you're right.

33:50.394 --> 33:51.605
Fair go.

34:01.605 --> 34:03.248
Tails, two tails.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.815
What, still here, Jack?

34:46.817 --> 34:48.551
Hmm? Mmm.

34:48.552 --> 34:49.851
How goes it?

34:49.853 --> 34:50.856
Well, jock.

34:52.856 --> 34:55.559
Look, um, will they cash a
check for me in this place?

34:55.560 --> 34:57.859
Yeah, for how much?

34:57.860 --> 34:59.164
Two hundred and ninety dollars.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.764
- Gonna try the game, eh?
- Yes.

35:04.835 --> 35:06.170
Two-ninety on heads.

35:15.779 --> 35:16.851
Well, he's on heads now.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.318
What are you betting on, mate?

35:23.319 --> 35:24.655
Two-ninety on heads.

35:24.656 --> 35:25.639
You're on.

37:03.353 --> 37:07.025
Can you... can you tell me
where the labor exchange is?

37:08.025 --> 37:11.293
Turn left as you go out,
second street, turn right,

37:11.294 --> 37:12.934
next street,
turn left, it's on the right.

39:14.951 --> 39:16.420
Yeah, so I say to this mug, I
said, "you better get out.

39:16.421 --> 39:18.854
"You're barred from the pub.

39:18.855 --> 39:19.820
"Every time you come in
here, you put on trouble."

39:19.821 --> 39:21.822
And then, all of a sudden,
he turned it on.

39:21.823 --> 39:22.992
I grabbed him by the scruff
of the neck and I hit him.

39:22.993 --> 39:24.926
Done the knuckle in.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.963
Knuckle's squished up
back here.

39:26.964 --> 39:28.835
Yeah, it's been six weeks.

39:31.835 --> 39:34.168
All these mugs I get in here.
They want to try you out.

39:34.169 --> 39:36.014
They all come from far
and wide to try you out.

39:45.014 --> 39:45.914
Hot?

39:48.184 --> 39:49.084
Hot.

39:52.155 --> 39:53.155
New to the yabba?

39:54.757 --> 39:55.829
New to the yabba.

39:59.829 --> 40:00.865
Like the old place?

40:02.865 --> 40:04.065
No, I think it's bloody awful.

40:05.034 --> 40:06.471
You don't like the yabba?

40:07.471 --> 40:08.485
No.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.118
Will you have a drink?

40:23.119 --> 40:25.586
No, I'm toying
with this one, thanks.

40:25.587 --> 40:27.856
Well, drink it down,
I'll buy you another.

40:27.857 --> 40:29.624
Look, I'm flat broke and
I can't afford to drink!

40:29.625 --> 40:31.191
What's that go to
do with it, man?

40:31.192 --> 40:33.894
I said I'd buy you a drink!
You don't have to buy me one!

40:33.895 --> 40:34.795
Now, drink it down!

40:47.110 --> 40:49.213
Two middies, Keith.
Don't forget the tomato juice.

40:50.213 --> 40:51.583
I'm Tim Hynes.

40:54.583 --> 40:55.483
John grant.

40:59.188 --> 41:01.525
Hey. Good shot.

41:02.525 --> 41:03.826
Are you a Mason?

41:03.827 --> 41:05.596
What? No!

41:06.596 --> 41:07.931
You're in the buffs.

41:07.932 --> 41:08.930
In the what?

41:08.931 --> 41:09.831
In the buffs.

41:10.300 --> 41:11.936
The buffs?

41:13.936 --> 41:16.605
Are you a member of
the buffalo lodge?

41:16.606 --> 41:18.076
No.
Never heard of it.

41:20.076 --> 41:21.177
Not a Mason, not a buff.

41:21.178 --> 41:22.944
No.

41:22.945 --> 41:25.114
Ah, you'll be
a Roman catholic, then.

41:25.115 --> 41:26.851
Oh, no, I'm not.

41:28.851 --> 41:30.259
Well, what are you going to do?

41:36.259 --> 41:37.892
You're not a buff?

41:37.893 --> 41:39.195
I am not a buff.

41:40.195 --> 41:41.964
Poor old John.

41:41.965 --> 41:43.631
Poor old John.

41:43.632 --> 41:45.570
Well, we better
have another beer.

41:46.570 --> 41:47.470
Hey!

41:48.237 --> 41:50.139
I was just checking your oil.

41:54.244 --> 41:55.611
Now, come on, John.

41:55.612 --> 41:56.812
Hey, Keith, a couple of beers!

42:01.150 --> 42:03.118
Well, here we are, John.

42:03.119 --> 42:04.240
- Home, sweet home.
- Uh-huh!

42:20.670 --> 42:23.074
Grab yourself a seat, John,
I'll tell Janette we're here.

42:25.074 --> 42:28.276
Janette! Put these in
the fridge, will you?

42:28.277 --> 42:31.038
Oh, I brought a friend back, so set
another place for lunch, will you?

43:09.985 --> 43:10.885
Oh!

43:14.391 --> 43:15.291
How do you do?

43:17.193 --> 43:18.195
Fine.

43:19.195 --> 43:20.202
How are you?

43:26.202 --> 43:29.237
I really must apologize for
landing on you like this.

43:29.238 --> 43:31.074
Mr. Hynes more
or less insisted.

43:32.074 --> 43:32.974
He usually does.

43:59.702 --> 44:01.152
Oh, my name's John grant.

44:16.152 --> 44:17.440
I'm Janette Hynes.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.775
Oh.

44:39.775 --> 44:40.675
Thanks.

45:00.429 --> 45:03.166
Over the teeth and round the gums,
look out belly, here it comes!

45:05.400 --> 45:07.235
Just a little
quickie before lunch.

45:07.236 --> 45:08.471
Lunch is ready now, daddy.

45:08.472 --> 45:10.772
I know.

45:10.773 --> 45:13.208
But firstly, John and I
must have an aperitif.

45:16.445 --> 45:17.914
Ah.

45:18.914 --> 45:19.814
John, old man,

45:21.150 --> 45:22.119
about your troubles,

45:24.119 --> 45:26.523
a terrible thing,
you losing all that money.

45:27.523 --> 45:29.457
You have no idea...

45:29.458 --> 45:31.460
No, it was somewhere between
the train and the hotel.

45:31.461 --> 45:32.862
Hmm.

45:33.862 --> 45:36.464
I could put a call
through to Sydney.

45:36.465 --> 45:38.440
No, there's no one
there I could borrow from.

45:44.440 --> 45:47.209
John, I'd love to
lend you some...

45:47.210 --> 45:49.491
No, no. No, no, no. I wouldn't,
really, I'll be all right.

45:50.179 --> 45:51.916
Ah, you're a good bloke.

45:53.916 --> 45:55.186
We'll think of something.

45:56.186 --> 45:58.187
Now, don't you worry, lad.

45:58.188 --> 45:59.356
- Right.
- And drink up.

46:00.356 --> 46:01.427
Drink up.

46:16.338 --> 46:17.507
I say!

46:19.141 --> 46:20.409
Wake up, Tim!

46:22.344 --> 46:24.847
Well, that's... That's dick and
Joe, couple of old mates of mine.

46:24.848 --> 46:27.216
I want you to meet them.

46:27.217 --> 46:28.338
Come on in, boys.
Come on in.

46:29.418 --> 46:31.252
Am I glad to see you!

46:31.253 --> 46:32.856
You look bloody awful, mate.

46:32.857 --> 46:34.388
I feel bloody awful!

46:34.389 --> 46:35.389
Hey!

46:36.226 --> 46:38.392
Too much of the old booze.

46:38.393 --> 46:40.228
Oh, cut it out, boys, will you?
Stop it!

46:40.229 --> 46:41.461
Hey. Let's all
have a drink.

46:41.462 --> 46:42.998
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- What, what?

46:42.999 --> 46:44.433
Who's your mate?

46:44.434 --> 46:45.635
Who? Oh, he...
Oh, that's John.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.535
This is, uh, dick and Joe.

46:47.536 --> 46:49.271
You're an ignorant bludger.

46:49.272 --> 46:50.942
- G'day.
- How are you?

46:52.942 --> 46:54.344
- G'day, John.
- How are you?

47:00.416 --> 47:02.286
Uh, you're new to the
yabba, are you, John?

47:03.286 --> 47:04.886
Yes. Yes.

47:04.887 --> 47:05.787
Hmm.

47:13.996 --> 47:14.896
G'day, Janette.

47:15.530 --> 47:16.430
Pretty as ever, eh?

47:30.947 --> 47:33.214
Missed me.

47:33.215 --> 47:35.456
Tim, I'll be moving off now.
Thanks for your hospitality.

47:37.452 --> 47:38.352
Moving off?

47:40.056 --> 47:41.322
Where would you be going, lad?

47:41.323 --> 47:42.223
Well, I've...

47:43.492 --> 47:44.527
Well, I've gotta look for work.

47:44.528 --> 47:46.361
On a Saturday?

47:46.362 --> 47:48.065
Look, why don't
you just hang around?

47:49.065 --> 47:49.965
We'll fix you up.

47:55.371 --> 47:57.605
Look, just drink your beer,

47:57.606 --> 47:59.047
sit down, stop worrying, huh?

48:05.047 --> 48:07.380
John's got a bit of trouble,
but nothing to worry about.

48:07.381 --> 48:08.684
She'll be right, mate.

48:08.685 --> 48:10.285
Drink up.

48:10.286 --> 48:11.626
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

48:17.626 --> 48:18.526
Hey.

48:31.673 --> 48:33.107
- Hey, Tim.
- Yeah?

48:33.108 --> 48:34.744
I got news for you, mate.

48:35.744 --> 48:36.644
What do you think?

48:37.512 --> 48:38.648
What do you think?

48:38.649 --> 48:39.715
You got piles.

48:41.317 --> 48:42.517
No, no, no, no.

48:42.518 --> 48:44.353
You know
Stanley's brindle bitch?

48:44.354 --> 48:46.455
- Yeah.
- Sold her to me.

48:46.456 --> 48:48.056
- English bred.
- You're a liar.

48:48.057 --> 48:49.424
It's the truth.

48:49.425 --> 48:51.125
She's got a broken leg.

48:51.126 --> 48:53.396
I'm not ribbing you,
mate, he sold her to me.

48:53.397 --> 48:55.696
A great dog. A great dog!

48:55.697 --> 48:56.666
A great dog.

48:57.666 --> 48:59.134
Good dog.

48:59.135 --> 49:01.669
Come off it, mate.

49:01.670 --> 49:04.539
This'll be one of the best bloody
dogs I've ever seen after roos.

49:04.540 --> 49:05.543
Eh?

49:07.543 --> 49:08.677
You've gotta be kidding!

49:10.012 --> 49:10.912
What makes a good dog?

49:14.150 --> 49:15.690
Can I help you?

49:20.690 --> 49:22.389
So, we let this ferret go
down the rabbit's burrow...

49:22.390 --> 49:23.670
I studied
history and literature.

49:26.329 --> 49:27.394
And what can you do with that

49:27.395 --> 49:29.434
if your parents are nobody
and you have no money?

49:31.434 --> 49:32.634
Oh, I know I can teach, but...

49:35.438 --> 49:38.140
I'd really like
to get to england.

49:38.141 --> 49:40.411
Well, this is bad enough,
but even Sydney, it's...

49:43.579 --> 49:44.900
I'd really like
to get to england.

49:46.815 --> 49:48.652
What would you do there?

49:49.652 --> 49:50.655
Journalism.

49:52.655 --> 49:53.753
Do you have a girl?

49:53.754 --> 49:54.654
Yes, in Sydney.

49:56.458 --> 49:57.358
What's her name?

49:58.061 --> 49:58.961
Robyn.

50:01.063 --> 50:02.067
Robyn.

50:04.067 --> 50:04.967
What's she like?

50:28.224 --> 50:29.865
Robyn.

50:36.865 --> 50:38.802
Would you take her
to england with you?

50:39.802 --> 50:40.702
Yes.

50:43.139 --> 50:44.039
Yes.

50:51.114 --> 50:52.781
Ooh!

50:52.782 --> 50:54.416
- Those are Saint Mary's.
- Hey, hey, hey.

50:54.417 --> 50:56.718
Yeah?

50:56.719 --> 50:59.121
What's the matter with him? He'd
rather talk to a woman than drink?

50:59.122 --> 51:00.589
School teacher.

51:00.590 --> 51:01.490
Oh.

51:05.128 --> 51:07.595
Then we agreed, before the game
started, there was a $5 limit.

51:07.596 --> 51:09.498
No, there was
no agreement, mate.

51:09.499 --> 51:11.433
Wait, wait, was that...

51:11.434 --> 51:12.904
What's the matter with you?

51:14.904 --> 51:16.739
There was no agreement made.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.839
Go on, you blokes, just...

51:18.840 --> 51:20.208
Was there any
bloody agreement made?

51:20.209 --> 51:21.743
- I don't know.
- No.

51:21.744 --> 51:23.612
I hate to remind
you this is my house...

51:27.782 --> 51:29.182
You're always
bloody interrupting...

51:29.284 --> 51:30.686
It's got nothing to do

51:31.686 --> 51:33.155
with whose bloody house it is.

51:33.156 --> 51:35.556
Doc Tydon, you old bastard.

51:35.557 --> 51:37.159
- How do you know that?
- Great to see you.

51:37.160 --> 51:38.759
Hi, boys.

51:38.760 --> 51:41.595
Have yourself a beer,
I got five aces coming up.

51:41.596 --> 51:43.831
If you're playing cards with
this lot, you'll need a doctor

51:43.832 --> 51:44.833
before the night is out.

51:55.710 --> 51:56.950
Why do you stay in Bundanyabba?

51:59.648 --> 52:01.552
No, I'm surprised,
I mean, you're

52:02.552 --> 52:04.486
pretty and...

52:04.487 --> 52:06.601
And there's a shortage of
pretty girls in this town.

52:18.601 --> 52:19.801
Ah, it's beautiful.
Smell that.

52:21.336 --> 52:22.271
Peppercorn.

52:29.211 --> 52:30.920
Is it because of your father?

52:38.920 --> 52:39.894
Sorry.

52:45.894 --> 52:48.562
The moonlight like snow

52:48.563 --> 52:51.248
upon the desert's dusty face.

53:06.248 --> 53:08.282
All right, dicky boy,
let's hear from you.

53:08.283 --> 53:09.916
- What've you got?
- Three Jacks, mate.

53:09.917 --> 53:11.652
Ah-ha! Well, just hold it,
hold it, hold it.

53:11.653 --> 53:12.553
- Daddy?
- Flush.

53:13.255 --> 53:14.788
Daddy?

53:14.789 --> 53:16.824
John and I are
going for a walk.

53:16.825 --> 53:18.891
Well come on, come on, come on,
get me while I'm hot, boys.

53:18.892 --> 53:20.132
An inside showing all the time.

56:24.045 --> 56:26.513
It's not the gravity.

56:26.514 --> 56:28.981
It's not the gravity
that makes the beer go down.

56:28.982 --> 56:30.820
- It's peristalsis.
- Perry who?

56:30.821 --> 56:31.987
Perry Mason.

56:33.989 --> 56:35.856
Peristalsis,
it's the contraction

56:35.857 --> 56:37.097
of the muscles
of the esophagus.

56:39.061 --> 56:40.829
Come on, doc, get up, man!

56:40.830 --> 56:41.864
Come on.

56:44.467 --> 56:46.601
Whoa, whoa!

56:55.911 --> 56:57.912
It'll be a week for sure.

56:57.913 --> 57:00.915
Hey, doc, doc?
Come in over here.

57:00.916 --> 57:03.984
Look, doc, when is
she gonna whelp, huh?

57:03.985 --> 57:06.255
I tell you what, I'll give
you five it's a week, Joe.

57:06.256 --> 57:07.791
Listen to the doc.

57:08.791 --> 57:09.791
She's not pregnant.

57:12.862 --> 57:14.782
Cut it out, doc, come on.
When's she gonna whelp?

57:15.498 --> 57:16.632
Who's the father?

57:18.032 --> 57:19.934
It's a dog, not a sheep.

57:24.507 --> 57:25.507
She'll have pups by morning.

57:25.508 --> 57:26.908
Beauty.

57:26.909 --> 57:27.909
No way, I bet it'll be a week.

57:27.910 --> 57:29.843
I don't feel anything.

57:29.844 --> 57:32.246
Come on, put your money out.
Five, right?

57:32.247 --> 57:34.048
- Five.
- You're on for five.

57:34.049 --> 57:35.989
Let's have a second opinion.

57:39.989 --> 57:40.889
Before morning.

57:42.657 --> 57:43.925
- It'll be a week.
- You heard me say that.

57:43.926 --> 57:45.526
I didn't.

57:45.527 --> 57:47.195
Who is the father, anyway?

57:47.196 --> 57:49.196
I don't know.

57:49.197 --> 57:51.197
She's a slag, this little
mutt, she'd try anything.

59:53.054 --> 59:55.121
You drank yourself
under the table

59:55.122 --> 59:56.728
after your little
episode with Janette.

59:59.728 --> 01:00:00.628
Get out.

01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:04.431
Don't get upset.

01:00:04.432 --> 01:00:06.335
We've all had our little
episodes with Janette.

01:00:12.173 --> 01:00:13.083
What a doll.

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:21.983
Better.

01:00:22.451 --> 01:00:24.185
You need a drink.

01:00:24.186 --> 01:00:26.421
Oh, no. Water, please.

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:29.055
Yabba water's only for washing.
Come on, drink it up.

01:00:29.056 --> 01:00:29.956
It's a bit flat.

01:00:41.103 --> 01:00:42.003
Come and get it.

01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:46.842
Oh, no, thanks very much,
but I don't...

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:49.142
No, I'm sure you don't.

01:00:49.143 --> 01:00:51.213
But you'd better
eat it just the same.

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.748
Come on, sit down.

01:00:53.748 --> 01:00:54.648
Sir John.

01:01:05.159 --> 01:01:06.730
Not too bad.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:08.779
Kangaroo.

01:01:23.779 --> 01:01:25.212
Want some sauce?

01:01:25.213 --> 01:01:26.349
What time did the, um...

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:29.152
The, uh, party finish?

01:01:31.152 --> 01:01:32.387
About dawn.

01:01:33.387 --> 01:01:34.523
And what time is it now?

01:01:35.523 --> 01:01:36.793
'Round about 4:00.

01:01:37.793 --> 01:01:38.797
4:00?

01:01:42.797 --> 01:01:44.531
Look...

01:01:44.532 --> 01:01:47.901
Look, uh, thanks
for the hospitality.

01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:49.853
I'd better be going along now.

01:02:04.853 --> 01:02:05.753
You see, I'm the

01:02:07.155 --> 01:02:08.236
school teacher at Tiboonda.

01:02:10.092 --> 01:02:10.992
And, um...

01:02:14.128 --> 01:02:16.800
Well, I lost all my money.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.802
Gambling.

01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:21.702
Yeah, I know.

01:02:24.505 --> 01:02:26.309
Why did you have to lie
about it to Tim Hynes?

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:29.309
There's no disgrace here.

01:02:31.213 --> 01:02:32.113
Well...

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.452
Well, in any case,
I can't stay in your, um,

01:02:38.452 --> 01:02:40.889
cabin, indefinitely, can I?

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:43.193
It isn't mine.

01:02:45.193 --> 01:02:47.360
I've just lived
here for five years.

01:02:47.361 --> 01:02:48.829
Anyway, you're
better off here than

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:50.932
trying to sponge on
men like Tim Hynes.

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.299
Sponge?

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.500
Yeah, sponge.

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:55.438
Sit down and eat your grub.

01:02:56.438 --> 01:02:57.574
You're gonna need it.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.510
We're going hunting
with dick and Joe.

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:02.478
Kangaroo.

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:05.380
- Hunting?
- Yeah, you were

01:03:08.483 --> 01:03:09.804
boasting in your cups,
and said...

01:03:11.519 --> 01:03:12.489
Good shot.

01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:17.929
You said you won a silver medal
at school for target shooting.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.328
Huh?

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.865
Remember?

01:03:23.865 --> 01:03:26.532
You wouldn't have
an aspirin, would you?

01:03:26.533 --> 01:03:27.733
No, I've got something better.

01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:39.479
This ought to
kill your headache

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.880
and pep you up
a little bit as well.

01:03:42.617 --> 01:03:44.487
Wash it down with
some beer. Here.

01:03:46.487 --> 01:03:47.920
Oh, I'm allergic to...

01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:51.304
Ah, there's nothing in there to hurt you.
Go on, man, swallow it down.

01:04:03.304 --> 01:04:04.407
What a voice.

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:07.647
She just opens her mouth and...

01:04:09.543 --> 01:04:10.914
And notes come floating out.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.449
Oh, sorry, I don't smoke.

01:04:15.449 --> 01:04:16.449
Would you like to try it?

01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:19.119
No.

01:04:24.592 --> 01:04:25.967
You've been here five years?

01:04:31.967 --> 01:04:33.971
Shall I satisfy your curiosity?

01:04:35.971 --> 01:04:37.572
I'm a doctor of medicine.

01:04:38.572 --> 01:04:40.307
And a tramp by temperament.

01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:41.208
I'm also an alcoholic.

01:04:43.077 --> 01:04:45.478
My disease prevented me
from practicing in Sydney,

01:04:45.479 --> 01:04:47.650
but out here it's
scarcely noticeable.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:50.690
Certainly doesn't stop people
from coming to see me.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:55.490
I charge no fees because I'm
not interested in money.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:59.426
Anyway, I'm unreliable.

01:04:59.427 --> 01:05:01.547
But I'm accepted socially
because I'm an educated man.

01:05:04.432 --> 01:05:05.335
Or character.

01:05:07.635 --> 01:05:09.338
I get my food from my friends.

01:05:10.338 --> 01:05:13.341
My requirements in beer.

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:15.275
Which, with some
measure of self-control,

01:05:15.276 --> 01:05:16.637
is the only
alcohol I allow myself.

01:05:19.313 --> 01:05:20.993
And you get along
without money altogether.

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:27.387
It's possible to live forever
in the yabba without money.

01:05:27.388 --> 01:05:29.589
As you probably noticed, some
of the natives are very...

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.260
Hospitable.

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:48.413
Take Janette for instance.

01:05:51.413 --> 01:05:53.254
Now there's a very
interesting biological case.

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:56.552
If she were a man,
she'd be in jail for rape.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:01.690
If I were to marry, Janette’s
just the sort of girl...

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:02.693
Excuse me.

01:06:04.693 --> 01:06:06.697
Uh, can you tell
me where the, um...

01:06:08.697 --> 01:06:09.597
Toilet?

01:06:10.532 --> 01:06:11.432
Yes.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.043
Outside.

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:22.811
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:06:23.811 --> 01:06:25.449
Do it out here in the open.

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:29.450
No one around to see.

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:40.762
If I were ever to marry,

01:06:41.762 --> 01:06:43.522
Janette’s the sort of
girl I'd like to marry.

01:06:47.168 --> 01:06:48.538
She likes sex.

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:52.577
She likes experiment
and she likes variety.

01:06:55.577 --> 01:06:57.844
We thought about
getting married once,

01:06:57.845 --> 01:07:00.165
but neither of us could live
with one person for very long.

01:07:02.516 --> 01:07:04.036
Still, she visits
me from time to time.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.720
When I want her.

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:11.432
And when she gets
bored with them.

01:07:18.432 --> 01:07:19.332
Beer?

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:28.668
What's wrong with a woman taking
a man because she feels like it?

01:07:30.644 --> 01:07:32.113
I really don't know.

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:33.682
Because there's
nothing wrong with it.

01:07:34.682 --> 01:07:36.649
Sex is just like eating.

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:39.184
It's a thing you do
because you have to.

01:07:39.185 --> 01:07:42.657
Not 'cause you want to, but
most people are afraid of it.

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:46.526
You seem offended by my
little discussion of Janette.

01:07:46.527 --> 01:07:48.663
In the circumstances, I
thought you'd be interested.

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:50.497
Well, I'm not.

01:07:50.498 --> 01:07:51.778
You're probably
a little puritan,

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.737
like the rest of these people.

01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:56.858
They think Janette’s a slut.

01:08:00.175 --> 01:08:01.575
The women who'd
like to act like her

01:08:03.277 --> 01:08:04.916
and the men she has
given a tumble to.

01:08:08.916 --> 01:08:10.554
Janette and I are alike.

01:08:12.554 --> 01:08:13.489
We break the rules.

01:08:15.489 --> 01:08:17.492
But we know more about
ourselves than most people.

01:08:31.805 --> 01:08:32.705
Hey, doc! Doc!

01:08:34.576 --> 01:08:36.676
Come on!

01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:38.077
Make a bit of noise,
boys, will you?

01:08:38.246 --> 01:08:39.546
Hi, dick.

01:08:41.314 --> 01:08:42.581
- Hey, Joe.
- In the back, fellas.

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:43.520
Get back there.

01:08:51.658 --> 01:08:54.594
Hey, John.
I got a gun here for you.

01:08:54.595 --> 01:08:56.115
A bit old, probably
blow your head off.

01:09:05.506 --> 01:09:06.840
Whoo-hoo!

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.710
Look at her go there, boys!

01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:32.532
Watch out the dog doesn't
leak on you, Johnny.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.644
Roos!

01:09:42.644 --> 01:09:43.983
Go on. Get the bludgers.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:58.896
Look at him go!

01:10:02.896 --> 01:10:03.796
Get him!

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.300
Go on! Go on!

01:10:13.274 --> 01:10:14.917
He's got him, he's got him!

01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:43.136
What are you doing? You want
to take my bloody head off?

01:10:46.307 --> 01:10:47.225
Look at him go!

01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:50.748
Get him! Get him!

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.990
Look at him go, will you?

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.904
Look at him go!

01:11:25.779 --> 01:11:28.454
Hey, Socrates.
You got a shot in yet?

01:11:51.005 --> 01:11:51.907
Get out.

01:11:52.907 --> 01:11:53.807
Beauty. It's a boomer.

01:11:56.677 --> 01:11:58.777
Knocked him out.
It's no good skinning him, eh?

01:11:58.778 --> 01:12:00.451
- Where's the surgeon?
- Here.

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:05.419
Doc eats 'em.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.981
Reckon they're
the best part of the roo.

01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:10.424
- Have you ever tried them?
- No.

01:12:10.425 --> 01:12:12.185
Better than oysters.
Put lead in your pencil.

01:12:20.801 --> 01:12:22.035
Any damage, sir?

01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:23.403
Ah, couple of dents.

01:12:23.404 --> 01:12:24.736
All right, now, let's go.

01:12:24.737 --> 01:12:25.777
No, no, let's get a drink.

01:12:26.507 --> 01:12:27.890
Johnny?

01:12:45.025 --> 01:12:47.095
Why don't you try
driving faster, mate?

01:12:48.095 --> 01:12:49.830
Hey, Stubbsy.

01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:50.731
Hi, fellas.

01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:53.901
Stick it up your arse.

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:55.836
Heya, mate.

01:12:55.837 --> 01:12:57.103
You got any roos?

01:12:57.104 --> 01:12:58.225
No, mate. Couple of boomers.

01:12:59.006 --> 01:13:00.772
You blokes couldn't
hit elephants.

01:13:00.773 --> 01:13:02.107
- Eh?
- Couldn't hit elephants.

01:13:02.108 --> 01:13:02.975
We'll get 'em
tonight with the spot.

01:13:02.976 --> 01:13:04.478
What's a spot?

01:13:04.479 --> 01:13:06.880
Spotlight, it hypnotizes them.

01:13:06.881 --> 01:13:08.549
- Hey, Stubbsy.
- Yeah?

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.711
Stick these in your deep-freeze
till tonight, will you?

01:13:11.118 --> 01:13:12.239
Hope they're not yours, doc.

01:13:20.494 --> 01:13:21.394
Fox.

01:13:33.006 --> 01:13:34.541
Hey, I hit him!

01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:36.176
Hey, John, where you going?

01:13:36.177 --> 01:13:37.180
I hit him!

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.540
It's no good skinning 'em, mate.
They're all mangy out here.

01:13:43.016 --> 01:13:44.137
Come on and drink your beer.

01:13:54.028 --> 01:13:55.028
Give us a
tailor-made, Joe

01:14:04.905 --> 01:14:06.507
- you need any more drinks?
- I guess it's my shout.

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.041
Oh, no, no.

01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:09.943
This last round's on me.

01:14:09.944 --> 01:14:11.977
Nobody who's broke
buys beers in the yabba.

01:14:11.978 --> 01:14:13.946
I'm not broke,
I've got a dollar.

01:14:13.947 --> 01:14:15.649
Forget it, John, forget it.

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:17.987
- $1.
- Look.

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:21.288
When you got some money,
you can take us on a bash.

01:14:21.289 --> 01:14:23.823
- Right?
- Right.

01:14:23.824 --> 01:14:25.526
- Stubbsy?
- Yeah.

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.295
Four more and
four double whiskeys.

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.929
Right.

01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.097
And a packet of
smokes for the teacher.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.965
Three whiskeys, dick.

01:14:31.966 --> 01:14:33.567
- Four.
- Three.

01:14:33.568 --> 01:14:35.069
- Four.
- Three.

01:14:36.069 --> 01:14:37.204
- Four.
- Three.

01:14:37.205 --> 01:14:38.307
Four.

01:16:20.073 --> 01:16:23.343
Hey, you got her fair, eh, doc?

01:16:23.344 --> 01:16:25.313
Hey, Joe, take a look
at this. It's a beauty.

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.947
Yeah.

01:16:26.948 --> 01:16:28.951
He must be a
seven-footer for sure.

01:16:31.953 --> 01:16:34.693
Go on, dick. We better cut
up a few for the dogs, eh?

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.362
The big fellow just
won't go down, doc.

01:17:14.362 --> 01:17:16.095
Take us over there.

01:17:16.096 --> 01:17:17.463
He kicks you, you're dead.

01:17:17.464 --> 01:17:18.365
Come on, take us over there.

01:17:18.366 --> 01:17:19.398
Righto, mate!

01:17:19.399 --> 01:17:20.299
Let's go.

01:17:37.118 --> 01:17:38.278
Get stuck into him, Joey boy.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.121
No worries!

01:17:52.065 --> 01:17:53.499
See the way the roo's
trying to draw him in

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.500
so he can get back
up on his tail, see?

01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:57.941
Yeah, and then he rips his guts
out with his hind legs like...

01:18:21.462 --> 01:18:23.362
All right!

01:18:23.363 --> 01:18:25.833
Yippee, Joey boy!

01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:28.836
Come and get your beer, fella!

01:18:44.351 --> 01:18:46.785
Once you've got her by the
tail, it's as good as dead.

01:18:46.786 --> 01:18:47.889
Have you ever done it, Joe?

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.255
- Dick?
- Eh?

01:18:49.256 --> 01:18:50.490
- Have you ever done it?
- What?

01:18:50.491 --> 01:18:52.792
Oh, yeah, hundreds of times.

01:18:52.793 --> 01:18:54.127
Yeah, of course he's done it.

01:18:54.128 --> 01:18:55.461
I've done it!

01:18:55.462 --> 01:18:57.201
Why? Do you want to
have a go, teacher?

01:19:00.201 --> 01:19:01.301
Why not?

01:19:03.203 --> 01:19:05.341
If I were you,
I wouldn't do it.

01:19:08.341 --> 01:19:09.662
Yeah, it's all right,
Joe, I will.

01:19:12.345 --> 01:19:13.916
You will?

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.874
What's the matter,
teacher? You scared?

01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:44.145
It's only a baby.
It's badly wounded.

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.514
Have a go, you mug.

01:19:55.989 --> 01:19:57.592
Go on, Johnny!

01:19:58.592 --> 01:20:00.626
Come on, Johnny!

01:20:00.627 --> 01:20:02.164
Go get him.

01:20:06.533 --> 01:20:08.313
He's trying to dance with him.

01:20:19.313 --> 01:20:21.180
Come on.

01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:22.382
Cut him through. Johnny!

01:20:22.383 --> 01:20:23.551
The throat!

01:20:35.328 --> 01:20:36.930
He's trying to beat
the thing to death.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:40.421
Through the throat, teacher.

01:20:47.307 --> 01:20:48.947
Come on, Johnny!

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:56.483
You beauty!

01:20:59.386 --> 01:21:01.420
Well done.

01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:04.966
Yeah, that's it,
Johnny, now you're one of us.

01:22:06.654 --> 01:22:08.729
You bloody maniacs.

01:22:15.729 --> 01:22:16.829
Bloody maniacs.

01:22:23.003 --> 01:22:25.542
I cannot accept
your premise, Socrates.

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:29.711
Affectability?

01:22:30.711 --> 01:22:31.813
Progress?

01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:34.716
A vanity spawned by fear.

01:22:38.085 --> 01:22:41.761
A vanity spawned by fear.

01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:50.563
The aim of what
you call civilization

01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:52.402
is a man in a smoking jacket,

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.773
whiskey and cider,
pressing a button of...

01:22:58.773 --> 01:22:59.673
A button

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:04.579
to destroy a planet
a billion Miles away,

01:23:06.579 --> 01:23:08.552
kill a billion
people he's never seen.

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:13.652
Where are you?

01:23:14.354 --> 01:23:15.454
Come on!

01:23:15.756 --> 01:23:16.690
What happened?

01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:19.360
Hey, what happened to Socrates?

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.394
Where's Socrates?

01:23:22.395 --> 01:23:23.567
- What?
- Socrates!

01:23:33.506 --> 01:23:35.578
You bastard.

01:23:40.581 --> 01:23:41.481
No, Joe!

01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:46.488
Stop it, you...
You murdering bastards.

01:23:47.488 --> 01:23:49.492
You bastards!

01:23:52.525 --> 01:23:53.425
Beat it, doc.

01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:05.676
You murdering bastards!

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:09.845
Bastard!

01:24:11.845 --> 01:24:13.750
You are...

01:24:45.746 --> 01:24:46.680
I'll get you.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.882
Okay, you old hippie, get out!

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:51.151
What's up?

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.554
Oh, Stubbsy, you bastard.
It's only a party.

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:54.922
Bloody maniacs.

01:24:55.922 --> 01:24:57.835
What do you want with me, doc?

01:25:12.172 --> 01:25:13.675
Bloody cow...

01:25:14.675 --> 01:25:15.942
You bloody coward!

01:25:15.943 --> 01:25:17.217
Whoa!

01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:29.203
Get off.

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:44.204
I need to...
Refrigeration.

01:26:13.533 --> 01:26:14.668
Doc.

01:26:15.668 --> 01:26:17.372
Turn it off, turn it off.

01:26:22.976 --> 01:26:24.344
No.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:25.886
No, no...

01:28:20.027 --> 01:28:20.927
Going?

01:28:23.363 --> 01:28:24.768
- Yes.
- Where?

01:28:27.768 --> 01:28:28.810
Sydney.

01:28:36.810 --> 01:28:38.052
Sydney.

01:28:46.052 --> 01:28:49.921
You want some food
before you go?

01:28:51.391 --> 01:28:52.493
No.

01:28:53.493 --> 01:28:54.962
How about a drink?

01:29:05.072 --> 01:29:07.942
Hey, don't forget your gun.

01:29:08.942 --> 01:29:10.042
What?

01:29:11.811 --> 01:29:13.331
The boys made you
a present of the gun.

01:29:26.126 --> 01:29:27.185
Bye.

01:30:26.185 --> 01:30:27.285
Better?

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:29.155
Yes, better.

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:33.559
Thanks, mate.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.460
Have another one.

01:30:35.162 --> 01:30:37.162
Oh...

01:30:37.163 --> 01:30:38.244
No, I don't really like to.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.908
One more beer, thanks, Joyce.

01:30:47.908 --> 01:30:50.842
Jock, you damn near saved
my life just now, how about

01:30:50.843 --> 01:30:52.819
completing the job by
giving me a cigarette, huh?

01:30:58.819 --> 01:30:59.962
Thanks.

01:31:08.962 --> 01:31:12.099
I thought you were pulling out
of the yabba on Saturday.

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:14.203
Hmm? Oh, yes,
yes, I was.

01:31:16.203 --> 01:31:17.907
What went wrong?

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:20.807
Oh, I got involved.

01:31:28.548 --> 01:31:29.649
Hey, there's my suitcases.

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.283
Yours, are they?

01:31:31.284 --> 01:31:32.524
Yes. I left them
here yesterday.

01:31:32.685 --> 01:31:33.585
No.

01:31:35.288 --> 01:31:36.992
No, not yesterday.

01:31:38.992 --> 01:31:40.291
No, it's the other day.

01:31:40.292 --> 01:31:42.227
They've been
here since Saturday.

01:31:42.228 --> 01:31:44.899
Look, if John says they're
his, then they're his.

01:31:45.899 --> 01:31:47.134
What's in them, John?

01:31:47.135 --> 01:31:48.603
Oh, it's clothes.

01:31:49.603 --> 01:31:50.676
Books.

01:31:56.676 --> 01:31:57.757
Couple of schooners, Joyce.

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:12.627
Like he said, books.

01:32:14.627 --> 01:32:16.188
Not that I doubted you,
of course, John.

01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:31.851
Is there anywhere
I can get a shower and shave?

01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:09.310
Thanks, mate.

01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:19.310
Right, thanks a lot.

01:35:19.311 --> 01:35:21.111
- Come and have a drink, mate.
- No, thanks.

01:35:21.112 --> 01:35:22.280
- Come and have a drink.
- Not interested...

01:35:22.281 --> 01:35:23.882
It will only take a minute.

01:35:23.883 --> 01:35:25.450
Come on, come and have a drink.

01:35:25.451 --> 01:35:28.352
Look, mate, I've given
up drinking for a while.

01:35:28.353 --> 01:35:29.454
What's wrong with you,
you bastard?

01:35:29.455 --> 01:35:30.854
Why don't you come
and drink with me?

01:35:30.855 --> 01:35:33.791
I just brought you 50 Miles eating
dust, and you won't drink with me.

01:35:33.792 --> 01:35:35.259
What's wrong with you?

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:37.096
What's the matter
with you people, huh?

01:35:37.097 --> 01:35:39.564
You sponge on you...

01:35:39.565 --> 01:35:41.366
You burn your house down,
murder your wife,

01:35:41.367 --> 01:35:43.367
rape your child,
that's all right.

01:35:43.368 --> 01:35:45.335
But don't have a drink with
you, don't have a flaming,

01:35:45.336 --> 01:35:46.838
bloody drink with you,
that's a criminal offense,

01:35:46.839 --> 01:35:48.842
that's the end of
the bloody world.

01:35:49.842 --> 01:35:50.802
You're mad, you bastard.

01:36:33.252 --> 01:36:35.612
Hey. The gent here wants to know
who owns that semi-trailer.

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:37.963
Who wants to know?

01:36:43.963 --> 01:36:44.932
Excuse me.

01:36:46.932 --> 01:36:49.535
You, uh...
You own the semi-trailer?

01:36:49.536 --> 01:36:51.202
What of it?

01:36:51.203 --> 01:36:53.171
Well, nothing, uh...

01:36:53.172 --> 01:36:54.945
I wanted to see if you
could give me a lift.

01:36:59.945 --> 01:37:01.313
Where you going?

01:37:01.314 --> 01:37:02.648
Right through.

01:37:02.649 --> 01:37:04.215
To the city, I mean.

01:37:04.216 --> 01:37:06.284
Well, I'm going
to the city myself.

01:37:06.285 --> 01:37:07.406
- Oh.
- How much is it worth?

01:37:10.256 --> 01:37:13.290
I am afraid I'm broke, that's
why I'm begging rides.

01:37:13.291 --> 01:37:15.893
Should be worth at
least a couple of dollars.

01:37:15.894 --> 01:37:17.094
Well, it would be, yes, but...

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:19.197
But I'm really flat.

01:37:19.198 --> 01:37:20.404
Make it $2 and we're sweet.

01:37:24.404 --> 01:37:26.243
Look, I've got $1.

01:37:30.243 --> 01:37:32.442
I... I've got a rifle.
I'll give you that.

01:37:32.443 --> 01:37:33.569
What sort of rifle?

01:37:56.569 --> 01:37:58.239
All right,
you ride in the back.

01:38:00.239 --> 01:38:01.239
Okay. Thanks.

01:38:25.631 --> 01:38:26.635
Hey, you, we're there.

01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:29.535
There?

01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:44.652
You know...

01:38:45.652 --> 01:38:47.421
I thought you said you
were going to Sydney.

01:38:48.421 --> 01:38:49.489
Don't know why.

01:38:50.489 --> 01:38:51.660
You said city, mate.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:54.700
Bundanyabba's a city, ain't it?

01:39:11.077 --> 01:39:13.685
Well, at least the trip
cost you nothing.

01:42:26.506 --> 01:42:28.506
Hey!

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.369
<i>I, uh, hate to
trouble you, John,</i>

01:42:57.369 --> 01:42:58.904
but rather than tire you,

01:42:58.905 --> 01:43:01.239
I thought I'd
write down what had

01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.943
happened and you
could sign it, okay?

01:43:03.943 --> 01:43:08.246
"The gunshot wound to my head
was the result of an accident.

01:43:08.247 --> 01:43:12.549
"I was visiting my friend, Clarence F.
Tydon, after a hunting trip.

01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:15.030
"I dropped my .22 rifle at the
floor of his kitchen butt first,

01:43:15.822 --> 01:43:17.855
"believing it to be unloaded.

01:43:17.856 --> 01:43:20.362
"It exploded,
and that's all I remember."

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:23.642
That'll be about it,
wouldn't it?

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:28.200
Here.

01:44:02.368 --> 01:44:04.067
You'd think a bloke
who'd won a silver medal

01:44:04.068 --> 01:44:06.303
at target shooting
could hit himself

01:44:06.304 --> 01:44:07.824
in the head at
a range of three inches.

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:12.678
Give me that.

01:44:44.042 --> 01:44:45.025
Don't wanna miss it.

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:34.862
Hey, mate.

01:45:35.862 --> 01:45:37.930
- You like a beer?
- Oh.

01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:40.064
Thanks.

01:45:40.065 --> 01:45:40.965
Here's cheers.

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:31.483
Hello, Charlie.

01:46:31.484 --> 01:46:32.820
Did you have a good holiday?

01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:35.989
The best.

01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:04.966
Yeah, that's it,
Johnny, now you're one of us.

01:22:06.654 --> 01:22:08.729
You bloody maniacs.

01:22:15.729 --> 01:22:16.829
Bloody maniacs.

01:22:23.003 --> 01:22:25.542
I cannot accept
your premise, Socrates.

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:29.711
Affectability?

01:22:30.711 --> 01:22:31.813
Progress?

01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:34.716
A vanity spawned by fear.

01:22:38.085 --> 01:22:41.761
A vanity spawned by fear.

01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:50.563
The aim of what
you call civilization

01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:52.402
is a man in a smoking jacket,

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.773
whiskey and cider,
pressing a button of...

01:22:58.773 --> 01:22:59.673
A button

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:04.579
to destroy a planet
a billion Miles away,

01:23:06.579 --> 01:23:08.552
kill a billion
people he's never seen.

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:13.652
Where are you?

01:23:14.354 --> 01:23:15.454
Come on!

01:23:15.756 --> 01:23:16.690
What happened?

01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:19.360
Hey, what happened to Socrates?

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.394
Where's Socrates?

01:23:22.395 --> 01:23:23.567
- What?
- Socrates!

01:23:33.506 --> 01:23:35.578
You bastard.

01:23:40.581 --> 01:23:41.481
No, Joe!

01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:46.488
Stop it, you...
You murdering bastards.

01:23:47.488 --> 01:23:49.492
You bastards!

01:23:52.525 --> 01:23:53.425
Beat it, doc.

01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:05.676
You murdering bastards!

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:09.845
Bastard!

01:24:11.845 --> 01:24:13.750
You are...

01:24:45.746 --> 01:24:46.680
I'll get you.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.882
Okay, you old hippie, get out!

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:51.151
What's up?

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.554
Oh, Stubbsy, you bastard.
It's only a party.

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:54.922
Bloody maniacs.

01:24:55.922 --> 01:24:57.835
What do you want with me, doc?

01:25:12.172 --> 01:25:13.675
Bloody cow...

01:25:14.675 --> 01:25:15.942
You bloody coward!

01:25:15.943 --> 01:25:17.217
Whoa!

01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:29.203
Get off.

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:44.204
I need to...
Refrigeration.

01:26:13.533 --> 01:26:14.668
Doc.

01:26:15.668 --> 01:26:17.372
Turn it off, turn it off.

01:26:22.976 --> 01:26:24.344
No.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:25.886
No, no...

01:28:20.027 --> 01:28:20.927
Going?

01:28:23.363 --> 01:28:24.768
- Yes.
- Where?

01:28:27.768 --> 01:28:28.810
Sydney.

01:28:36.810 --> 01:28:38.052
Sydney.

01:28:46.052 --> 01:28:49.921
You want some food
before you go?

01:28:51.391 --> 01:28:52.493
No.

01:28:53.493 --> 01:28:54.962
How about a drink?

01:29:05.072 --> 01:29:07.942
Hey, don't forget your gun.

01:29:08.942 --> 01:29:10.042
What?

01:29:11.811 --> 01:29:13.331
The boys made you
a present of the gun.

01:29:26.126 --> 01:29:27.185
Bye.

01:30:26.185 --> 01:30:27.285
Better?

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:29.155
Yes, better.

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:33.559
Thanks, mate.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.460
Have another one.

01:30:35.162 --> 01:30:37.162
Oh...

01:30:37.163 --> 01:30:38.244
No, I don't really like to.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.908
One more beer, thanks, Joyce.

01:30:47.908 --> 01:30:50.842
Jock, you damn near saved
my life just now, how about

01:30:50.843 --> 01:30:52.819
completing the job by
giving me a cigarette, huh?

01:30:58.819 --> 01:30:59.962
Thanks.

01:31:08.962 --> 01:31:12.099
I thought you were pulling out
of the yabba on Saturday.

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:14.203
Hmm? Oh, yes,
yes, I was.

01:31:16.203 --> 01:31:17.907
What went wrong?

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:20.807
Oh, I got involved.

01:31:28.548 --> 01:31:29.649
Hey, there's my suitcases.
