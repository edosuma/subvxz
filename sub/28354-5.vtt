After 15 years in prison,
waiting is easy.

00:10.103 --> 00:13.673
It's like time slows down for me,
and I see the beauty in everything.

00:22.587 --> 00:25.571
The only thing that's hard for
me to see the beauty in now...

00:29.039 --> 00:31.227
...is in the person I used to be.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.024
I've moved past that person.

00:34.555 --> 00:38.477
I'm a father now, and a father
sets examples for his kids.

00:38.985 --> 00:40.860
When you're a child,
you act like a child.

00:41.562 --> 00:42.945
But when you become a man,

00:43.132 --> 00:46.639
you get on your grown man shit and
put those childish ways behind you.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.694
Aah, come on, man!

00:49.116 --> 00:50.507
We been here four hours!

00:51.155 --> 00:52.827
My phone died two hours ago, man.

00:53.507 --> 00:54.858
Come on!

00:55.975 --> 00:57.686
I'm done. I'm done.

00:58.132 --> 00:59.702
I don't want to be here no more.

01:05.937 --> 01:07.859
All right, you're doing great, Shahzad.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.586
Yeah, slow and steady.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.186
Straighten it out.
Good, good, good, good.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.171
Hey, learn how to drive
before I beat your ass!

01:15.764 --> 01:17.303
I don't think he saw
that you were a kid.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.007
He was looking right
at me when he said it.

01:19.108 --> 01:20.741
Straighten out. Straighten out.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.225
There you go. Perfect.

01:23.304 --> 01:24.702
Now we're approaching a stop sign.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.038
You know what that means, right?

01:27.154 --> 01:28.882
It's... it's right on the sign.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.510
Yeah. Just making sure.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.768
What are you doing? You didn't stop.

01:33.018 --> 01:34.448
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't stop.

01:34.518 --> 01:37.135
You rolled right... You rolled
right through it at a stop sign.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.329
I did stop!

01:39.266 --> 01:41.333
Aw, shoot. Pull over.

01:41.641 --> 01:44.266
- I know. I am. I'm pulling over.
- Okay. All right.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.742
Stay calm. Roll down your window.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.789
Don't worry. I will handle this.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.258
I will handle this.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.820
Hello, Officer.

02:00.297 --> 02:02.187
What seems to, uh, be a problem?

02:02.500 --> 02:04.656
You know you drove through a
stop sign back there, right?

02:04.680 --> 02:06.156
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.508
I'm teaching my son how to drive, so...

02:09.038 --> 02:10.639
- Well, that's understandable.
- Thank you.

02:10.663 --> 02:11.944
But I got to write him a ticket.

02:12.429 --> 02:14.700
- What?! Are you kidding me?
- He broke the law.

02:14.827 --> 02:17.007
Oh, come on, man. You know what?

02:17.139 --> 02:19.304
Instead of standing
here, harassing my son,

02:19.329 --> 02:22.600
you should be somewhere else
actually stopping a real crime.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.756
All right, bud, you need to calm down.
I am doing my job here, okay?

02:26.663 --> 02:28.280
Okay, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.834
Can we start over, please?

02:29.859 --> 02:30.962
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, Officer.

02:30.986 --> 02:32.898
I know that a law was broken.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.820
I'm just asking you to take into account

02:34.822 --> 02:38.093
that no one was harmed, and this, uh...

02:38.694 --> 02:40.726
this is actually a teachable moment.

02:43.194 --> 02:44.460
No, I get that.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.327
Someone came along and spoiled
my father/son bonding moment,

02:48.352 --> 02:49.952
I'd probably get pretty pissed off, too.

02:50.053 --> 02:51.092
Why don't we call it even,

02:51.116 --> 02:53.187
and I'll let you off
with a warning, right?

02:53.327 --> 02:55.061
Thank you. Thank you, Officer.

02:55.225 --> 02:57.387
- Yeah, and I'm sorry for yelling.
- No worries. No worries.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.303
Stressful teaching your son
how to drive, by the way.

02:59.327 --> 03:01.256
- Yeah.
- I had to do it myself a couple times.

03:01.365 --> 03:02.787
No kidding. Well, thank you.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.209
- I appreciate it.
- All right.

03:04.422 --> 03:05.758
- Thank you, Officer!
- All right!

03:07.397 --> 03:08.733
Wow!

03:08.961 --> 03:10.828
Way to get out of a ticket, Dad.

03:10.921 --> 03:12.031
Yeah, well, you know what?

03:12.062 --> 03:13.358
Sometimes in life, when you're right,

03:13.382 --> 03:14.582
you got to put your foot down.

03:14.718 --> 03:17.389
When you're wrong, you cry and
claim you had to rush to a bathroom.

03:17.905 --> 03:19.858
Yeah, I've seen Mom use that one before.

03:19.883 --> 03:22.687
- Yeah. Both are effective.
- Yeah.

03:23.008 --> 03:25.218
<i>By medieval times, things
had actually gotten worse.</i>

03:25.463 --> 03:27.563
- Hey!
- Hi. How did it go?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.141
He is getting better.

03:29.166 --> 03:32.126
Only one person spit on the
car today, so that's good.

03:32.173 --> 03:34.703
Yeah, I mean, Tray's gonna be impressed
when he takes me out tomorrow.

03:34.727 --> 03:36.615
What?! Uhh-uhh, he's not
showing you how to drive.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.211
That man hasn't driven in 15 years.

03:38.328 --> 03:40.743
No, he just got his license back
so he could drive the food truck.

03:40.767 --> 03:41.812
I didn't think you'd mind.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.488
I thought we were gonna have discussions

03:43.490 --> 03:45.524
before we made major decisions.

03:45.687 --> 03:47.351
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.898
By the way, what was that,
uh... that $500 charge

03:51.000 --> 03:53.273
that I saw online for Louis Vuitton.

03:53.328 --> 03:54.789
- I can't remember.
- You know what?

03:55.312 --> 03:57.603
A driving lesson ain't
never hurt nobody.

03:57.828 --> 03:59.238
At least he is trying.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.226
I didn't know he could reach the pedals.

04:01.861 --> 04:02.873
Burn.

04:03.206 --> 04:04.312
That was a good burn.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.278
That was a very good burn. Nice.

04:06.492 --> 04:08.538
Go apologize, though.
That was kind of mean.

04:09.085 --> 04:10.444
- What?
- You heard me.

04:10.538 --> 04:12.045
Go apologize. He's sensitive.

04:13.264 --> 04:14.381
Go, go, go, go, go.

04:15.030 --> 04:18.223
Hey, did we settle on a time
with the Carrolls tomorrow?

04:18.428 --> 04:20.428
Oh, I forgot.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.614
I thought we would just,
like, hang out tomorrow.

04:22.639 --> 04:25.475
Babe, we promised, all
right? We can't cancel on 'em.

04:25.545 --> 04:27.710
They're gonna think we
have a problem with them.

04:27.801 --> 04:28.811
I do!

04:28.836 --> 04:30.602
I mean, they are so annoying.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.326
They're always like,
"Can we go to breakfast?

04:32.350 --> 04:33.572
Can we go to lunch? Can we have dinner?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.810
Come have coffee. Have
wine in our backyard."

04:35.835 --> 04:38.653
I don't want to see they backyard.
I mean, they are so not interesting.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.747
I get it, but you're the
one who says we need more

04:40.772 --> 04:43.272
couple friends, and we got
to put ourselves out there.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.380
Oh, you're right.

04:46.092 --> 04:47.131
But can we reschedule?

04:47.264 --> 04:49.099
No, we rescheduled three times.

04:49.124 --> 04:51.108
They live down the block.
That would look bad.

04:51.295 --> 04:52.732
It would look very bad.

04:54.311 --> 04:55.920
All right, well, I'm getting drunk.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.239
Shahzad, this is where your
grandpa first taught me how to drive.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.747
By jumping in the car
with a handful of cash

05:05.004 --> 05:07.847
and a gunshot wound, something
about, "Drive, nigga! Drive!"

05:07.880 --> 05:08.965
That's horrible.

05:09.316 --> 05:11.213
Yeah, but I might be
embellishing a little bit.

05:11.238 --> 05:12.331
You know what I'm saying?

05:12.449 --> 05:14.249
We was poor as shit.
That happened on the bus.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.426
Man, you really lived "The Wire."

05:16.590 --> 05:19.207
Yeah, but I'm here with you, my
son, teaching you how to drive.

05:19.925 --> 05:20.986
First thing I got to teach you

05:20.988 --> 05:22.754
is how to relax behind the wheel.

05:22.925 --> 05:24.879
For real, man. You
need to loosen up, okay?

05:25.066 --> 05:26.526
You're over there white-knuckling it.

05:26.550 --> 05:28.487
You know, matter of fact,
holler at shorty right here.

05:28.511 --> 05:29.861
- Right here?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

05:30.245 --> 05:31.396
Yo, what up?

05:31.534 --> 05:33.455
Oh, word. All I said was hi.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.666
Stop sign. Slow down.

05:36.573 --> 05:38.080
Okay, now pull over right
here and let me teach you

05:38.104 --> 05:39.221
how to double park.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.588
Oh, shit.

05:47.690 --> 05:49.284
Come on, son. Yo, straighten up.

05:49.309 --> 05:50.989
- Put your hands up.
- My hands is up, man.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.519
Be cool, Bobby!

05:59.721 --> 06:01.793
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

06:02.033 --> 06:03.572
License and registration.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.546
- Shahzad.
- What?

06:10.651 --> 06:12.026
Stop with the sudden movements, man.

06:12.050 --> 06:14.170
- You trying to get us killed?
- Here you go, Officer.

06:16.401 --> 06:18.698
I stopped at the stop
sign. I know I did.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.432
I counted to three Mississippi.

06:20.651 --> 06:23.011
Don't you dare say the word
Mississippi with this white cop.

06:23.073 --> 06:24.221
You'll give him ideas.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.477
What are you talking about?!

06:25.501 --> 06:26.901
I'm your father, man. Listen to me.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.089
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Officer.

06:30.114 --> 06:31.207
And here's your ticket.

06:31.449 --> 06:33.239
Hold on, a ticket.
This must be a mistake.

06:33.418 --> 06:34.942
A ticket, off... Wait a minute.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.061
Are you serious?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.832
Don't you have anything better to do?

06:37.973 --> 06:39.715
'Cause while you're
standing here harassing us,

06:39.739 --> 06:41.371
you're wasting our
hard-earned tax dollars.

06:41.395 --> 06:43.237
Nobody in here pays taxes, brother.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.965
- Sir, you need to calm down.
-  I am calm!

06:45.090 --> 06:49.307
Look, Officer, I understand
that you think I broke the law,

06:49.309 --> 06:50.730
- but I didn't.
- Mnh-mnh.

06:50.755 --> 06:51.989
And I need you to take into account

06:52.013 --> 06:55.738
that nobody's harmed here,
and this is a teachable moment.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.718
I'm gonna ask you to put
your hands on the dashboard.

06:58.742 --> 07:00.696
- Oh, come on!
- Aw, man!

07:01.018 --> 07:02.736
That's how they got
me last time, cuzzo.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.743
I'd like to see 'em try to plant
something on me this time.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.813
Shay, you should have
seen how this boy was

07:10.838 --> 07:12.040
yelling at the police.

07:12.188 --> 07:14.422
Wait. You think he got
the wrong idea from me?

07:14.494 --> 07:16.032
Oh, no, Josh, you good, okay?

07:16.336 --> 07:17.508
Shay's the black one.

07:17.824 --> 07:19.259
You know you're supposed to tell him

07:19.283 --> 07:21.360
about all of this stuff
in the street, Shannon.

07:21.477 --> 07:23.563
What else did you skip teaching my son?

07:23.649 --> 07:26.602
How to do the Wop? Oprah
Winfrey? Grape soda?

07:26.696 --> 07:29.415
Wait a minute. Does Shahzad
even know he's black?

07:29.540 --> 07:31.667
Shahzad knows he's black, okay?

07:31.692 --> 07:32.806
I just didn't have the talk
with him about how

07:32.830 --> 07:33.963
to deal with the police.

07:34.251 --> 07:35.887
What?! Then fine. Then I'mma do it.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.197
Oh, no, you are not
having the talk with him.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.626
That's what you're not doing.

07:39.861 --> 07:41.165
But I'm the most qualified!

07:41.228 --> 07:43.548
Just because you sold crack
does not make you qualified.

07:43.587 --> 07:46.609
You know what? Me and Josh
will go up there with you,

07:46.634 --> 07:48.711
and we'll all have this
conversation together.

07:48.736 --> 07:49.798
Come on.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.603
Come on!

07:52.206 --> 07:55.898
All police are racists.
Even police dogs are racists.

07:55.923 --> 07:57.361
Really, Jay, the dogs?

07:57.408 --> 07:58.767
If they could hold a match,

07:59.165 --> 08:00.986
the first thing they
would do is burn a cross.

08:01.142 --> 08:03.025
Shahzad, it's not about
cops being racists.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.689
It's about how you talk to that cop.

08:04.913 --> 08:07.113
Talked? Shay, he yelled at him.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.431
You can't do that.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.610
There are three phrases
you can say to the police...

08:10.634 --> 08:13.024
"No sir," "Yes, sir," and
"It was already like that

08:13.026 --> 08:14.415
when I got here, sir."

08:14.495 --> 08:16.533
Same thing you say to
your prom date's father.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.283
I was only doing what dad did.

08:18.423 --> 08:20.039
This dude is white, okay?

08:20.064 --> 08:22.595
You got to be at least
Steph Curry light-skinned

08:22.620 --> 08:23.712
to pull that off.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.166
- How is that fair?
- Fair?

08:26.026 --> 08:28.573
I got 15 years for
selling 2 ounces of crack

08:28.822 --> 08:30.782
when there's white boys
out here getting probation

08:30.822 --> 08:32.541
for stealing airplanes. Why?!

08:32.947 --> 08:34.003
Racism.

08:34.076 --> 08:35.525
Tray, can we not?

08:35.986 --> 08:38.024
I don't want Shahzad growing
up to hate the police.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.001
You threw a brick
through a cop car window!

08:40.096 --> 08:42.120
The real Shay who sweared to God

08:42.121 --> 08:45.221
that government is trying
to put AIDS into Pop Tarts.

08:45.354 --> 08:47.585
You know what? I think we're
getting a little off track.

08:47.869 --> 08:50.161
Sure, there are some racist cops,

08:50.163 --> 08:53.265
but a few bad apples
doesn't make the bunch bad.

08:53.479 --> 08:54.862
This coming from a white dude.

08:54.971 --> 08:57.463
No, he's right. All cops are not bad.

08:57.682 --> 09:00.158
And that's coming from a black
chick that married a white dude.

09:00.182 --> 09:02.815
And that's coming from
a black ex-crack dealer.

09:02.908 --> 09:03.987
Touché.

09:04.137 --> 09:06.737
Coming from a black person who
has a cousin named "Touché."

09:06.877 --> 09:08.979
Shahzad, bottom line is this.

09:09.362 --> 09:12.057
At the end of the day, you
could do everything right,

09:12.346 --> 09:14.586
and a cop still could kill
you and get away with it.

09:14.924 --> 09:17.846
It's not about racism all the
time, like Tray likes to think.

09:18.635 --> 09:20.407
But it does happen to black people

09:20.432 --> 09:22.424
more than it happens to anyone else.

09:22.869 --> 09:26.134
But... not to black
people like us, right?

09:26.267 --> 09:27.446
- What?!
- Shahzad!

09:27.471 --> 09:28.501
What'd you just say?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.046
There's the problem right there, Shay.

09:30.438 --> 09:32.118
The boy don't think
it could happen to him.

09:32.532 --> 09:34.095
Let me tell you something, man.

09:35.446 --> 09:37.486
You don't hear me say
nothing, you better hear this.

09:37.988 --> 09:41.261
The world don't care what kind
of black person you are, okay?

09:41.691 --> 09:44.574
In the wrong place, wrong
time, you just black.

09:54.175 --> 09:56.043
You a'ight, Tray? You seem down.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.136
I was thinking about my son.

09:58.824 --> 10:00.972
I had to have the police
talk with him today.

10:01.277 --> 10:03.065
Oh, I remember that. I had
the talk with my daughter.

10:03.089 --> 10:04.143
What'd you say to her?

10:04.191 --> 10:05.644
I told her, first and foremost,

10:05.761 --> 10:07.785
treat every cop with
respect, no matter what.

10:07.810 --> 10:08.830
- Mm-hmm.
- Word.

10:08.855 --> 10:10.925
Then a SWAT team busted in
and shot me in the stomach,

10:10.949 --> 10:12.448
so I don't remember anything after that.

10:12.472 --> 10:13.987
Hopefully, it was enough
to fill in the blanks.

10:14.011 --> 10:15.518
That's why I'm teaching my little man

10:15.543 --> 10:18.230
to avoid police at all
costs. It's that bad now.

10:18.293 --> 10:21.221
Say word. When I was a kid, my
only worries was getting AIDS

10:21.246 --> 10:23.188
- or get hooked on crack.
- Simpler times.

10:23.605 --> 10:26.151
I know I'm white and all, but
I'm well aware of my privilege.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.072
Shoot, I did my first robbery
with a grenade launcher,

10:29.097 --> 10:30.706
and all they gave me was probation.

10:30.800 --> 10:31.814
- What?
- Mm.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.231
The real problem that
happened with Shahzad,

10:33.233 --> 10:36.483
I don't think he knows what it is
to be a black male in America.

10:36.529 --> 10:37.639
What we have here is

10:38.358 --> 10:42.029
a classic case of Theo
Huxtable Syndrome... THS.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.250
What are you talking about?

10:43.279 --> 10:44.776
I'm talking about your boy being trapped

10:44.778 --> 10:47.278
in a black bubble of privilege.
He's got those glasses.

10:47.693 --> 10:49.420
Probably goes to a real
nice private school.

10:49.568 --> 10:51.769
- Best in the city.
- I bet he lives in a brownstone

10:51.794 --> 10:53.012
that's got all those jazz musicians

10:53.036 --> 10:54.684
just coming in day and
night, playing they music.

10:54.708 --> 10:56.833
Yeah, well, Shay don't
invite me over at night.

10:57.341 --> 10:59.341
- But I can only assume so.
- Precisely.

10:59.443 --> 11:02.737
So, your son has no concept
of real black struggle,

11:02.762 --> 11:04.997
and he need to know, being
a young brother out here,

11:05.137 --> 11:07.536
ain't nothing and no place safe, okay?

11:07.645 --> 11:09.981
Matter of fact, he need
to come down to the school

11:10.006 --> 11:11.967
and meet the kids that I do
the Scared Straight program with

11:11.991 --> 11:13.857
over at Andrew Johnson High.

11:13.893 --> 11:15.460
The John? I used to go there, man.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.708
I wish I could go back
and drop out again.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.981
Well, Tray, the school's
still pretty messed up.

11:20.006 --> 11:21.544
Like, the kids don't have nothing.

11:21.864 --> 11:24.989
Saw a young boy the other day
using a pizza box as a locker.

11:25.114 --> 11:26.192
See, that's it.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.824
- Shahzad needs a change of environment.
- Mm-hmm.

11:28.996 --> 11:31.036
He needs to go where the
real struggle is happening.

11:31.113 --> 11:32.121
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

11:32.168 --> 11:33.316
He needs to spend a day at the John.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.582
- John! -John!
- Oh, big John.

11:35.801 --> 11:37.129
Sound like a bathroom, right?

11:37.246 --> 11:38.777
Toilet. It is one.

11:47.168 --> 11:49.636
- Hey! -Hi!
- Hey! Hi, guys.

11:49.661 --> 11:51.136
How are you? Good to see you.

11:51.161 --> 11:52.393
Good to see you. Mwah!

11:52.487 --> 11:54.087
It's good to see you.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.183
Hi.

11:55.293 --> 11:57.136
Great to see you. You look great.

11:57.206 --> 11:58.238
It's been so crazy.

11:58.355 --> 12:00.050
Yeah. Yeah, you guys look great.

12:00.191 --> 12:01.751
- Thank you.
- Hope you guys are hungry.

12:01.925 --> 12:03.065
- We are.
- Starving.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.085
Come and sit down.

12:04.110 --> 12:05.398
Yeah, exciting.

12:06.578 --> 12:08.485
So, what's good here?

12:10.197 --> 12:13.288
So, then John's big ol'
foot steps on the hem,

12:13.313 --> 12:15.320
and the dress completely unravels.

12:15.345 --> 12:16.360
Oh, my gosh.

12:16.422 --> 12:18.125
See, that's why you
can't wear sample dresses.

12:18.149 --> 12:19.320
I didn't know.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.060
She hid in the bathroom the whole time.

12:21.322 --> 12:23.116
Oh. Oh, hey, this is us. This is us.

12:23.141 --> 12:25.117
- All right.
- Guys, so great to see you.

12:26.297 --> 12:27.512
Mm. Good to see you, man.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.489
- Yes, let's do it again.
- We have to.

12:29.514 --> 12:32.074
We got to do this again soon, guys.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.421
- Absolutely. So fun.
- I loved that.

12:33.445 --> 12:34.452
Yes. All righty.

12:34.477 --> 12:36.406
- See you later.
- Okay. Bye!

12:38.062 --> 12:39.161
Wasn't that fun?

12:39.250 --> 12:40.828
Yeah, it was a good time.

12:42.602 --> 12:45.155
Man, I can't believe I
was trying to avoid them.

12:45.180 --> 12:46.765
- I'm so sorry.
- You notice anything odd

12:46.789 --> 12:49.101
- about Nikki's hellos and goodbyes?
- Like what?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.796
- That Nikki was a mouth kisser?
- A what?

12:51.953 --> 12:53.659
Yeah. She kissed me on the mouth.

12:55.597 --> 12:57.790
Maybe it was an
accident, like, you know,

12:57.815 --> 12:59.144
when you try to kiss
someone on the cheek,

12:59.146 --> 13:01.283
and then they turn
left, and you turn right,

13:01.308 --> 13:02.705
and then your lips accidentally touch.

13:02.729 --> 13:05.016
Yeah, I thought about
that, but she did it twice.

13:05.394 --> 13:06.431
Twice?

13:06.456 --> 13:07.995
Yeah, she did it once when we got there,

13:08.019 --> 13:09.579
and then she did it again when we left.

13:09.925 --> 13:12.079
No, kiss you on the
lips once, shame on her.

13:12.104 --> 13:14.720
Kiss you on the lips twice,
now you like kissing the bitch.

13:14.745 --> 13:16.329
Bitch? You were just talking about her

13:16.354 --> 13:17.737
like you guys were
gonna be best friends.

13:17.761 --> 13:18.931
Well, that was before I knew

13:18.956 --> 13:20.854
she was trying to kiss
my husband in the mouth.

13:21.198 --> 13:22.659
I didn't even think it means anything.

13:22.683 --> 13:23.963
I'm just overthinking it right now.

13:23.987 --> 13:25.214
No. No, where I come from,

13:25.239 --> 13:27.720
when a woman tries to kiss you
on the lips, it means something.

13:27.745 --> 13:28.972
Okay, well, in this case,

13:29.109 --> 13:32.011
I think it means hello
and goodbye. That's all.

13:32.347 --> 13:34.939
Well, I feel like she feel
every time she see you,

13:34.964 --> 13:36.479
she get to kiss you on the lips.

13:36.729 --> 13:39.269
Now, you gonna need to nip
this in the bud right away.

13:39.901 --> 13:41.876
Or she gonna end up
with some bald spots.

13:41.901 --> 13:42.931
You feel me?

13:42.956 --> 13:45.011
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.862
See? That's all you had to do.

13:50.301 --> 13:51.987
See? Just that easy.

13:52.956 --> 13:54.057
I see.

14:03.026 --> 14:04.206
Okay, everybody.

14:04.995 --> 14:06.683
Okay, everybody, settle!

14:06.971 --> 14:08.072
God damn it, settle.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.950
I'd like to introduce to
you a former alumni here

14:11.952 --> 14:13.808
at Andrew Johnson High.

14:14.081 --> 14:15.425
He later went on to sell crack,

14:15.511 --> 14:17.128
and he went to jail for 15 years,

14:17.190 --> 14:20.534
and he strongly denies doing
any gay stuff in the pen, okay?

14:20.964 --> 14:22.323
Ladies and gentlemen, young adults,

14:22.347 --> 14:24.964
put your hands together
right now for Tray Barker.

14:25.002 --> 14:27.612
He also owns his own business. Holla.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.206
Thanks a lot for that
terrible-ass introduction.

14:31.886 --> 14:34.038
But like he said, I went here, too,

14:34.620 --> 14:36.500
so I understand what
y'all go through every day.

14:36.938 --> 14:40.298
Rats in the hallway, 50 kids
in a class, raggedy ass books.

14:40.323 --> 14:43.839
I failed history 'cause my
book only had 12 pages in it.

14:43.995 --> 14:45.862
I thought the Pilgrims shot Kennedy.

14:47.026 --> 14:50.698
But I'm here 'cause I want my
son to survive in this world.

14:51.269 --> 14:53.795
And his rich, private school
isn't preparing him for that.

14:53.972 --> 14:55.427
What are you talking about?

14:55.521 --> 14:57.802
Everybody here would love to
go some rich, private school.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.146
We hate it here.

14:59.318 --> 15:01.701
That's what the struggle
prepares you for... life.

15:01.982 --> 15:05.222
Yeah, but that don't get you a
good job or to a good college.

15:05.310 --> 15:06.537
Um, thank you.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.332
And how is not having
he in our classrooms

15:08.357 --> 15:09.724
gonna help me pass the ACTs?

15:09.974 --> 15:11.560
Struggle builds character.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.615
If I wanted to build character,

15:13.701 --> 15:15.709
I eat the meatloaf off y'all cafeteria.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.515
Like, this is B.S.

15:17.724 --> 15:19.002
Don't nobody cares about us here.

15:19.026 --> 15:21.841
Why would they? The person the
school is named after is racist.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.225
- Andrew Johnson?
- Yeah, that's true.

15:23.249 --> 15:25.248
All them old-ass
presidents were racists.

15:26.287 --> 15:29.529
But this is a school full
of black and brown kids.

15:30.099 --> 15:32.529
You wouldn't make a bunch of
Jewish kids go to Hitler High.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.654
Hell, no.

15:33.794 --> 15:35.982
Y'all walk past a statue of a man

15:36.154 --> 15:38.427
who didn't even want
y'all to have an education.

15:39.201 --> 15:41.361
Isn't that like what you
were telling me about earlier?

15:41.802 --> 15:45.318
Isn't that the same as
the police mistreating us?

15:45.748 --> 15:47.740
I never thought of
it like that, you know?

15:48.181 --> 15:49.779
You're right. Touché.

15:49.804 --> 15:50.818
Yeah? What?

15:50.977 --> 15:53.638
At my school, when they
wouldn't adopt Singapore math,

15:53.974 --> 15:54.998
we resisted.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.779
We refused to show work on our test.

16:00.248 --> 16:03.818
What I'm saying is
y'all need to fight back.

16:04.037 --> 16:05.162
Yo, he's right.

16:05.310 --> 16:07.249
We should tear that statue
of Andrew Johnson down.

16:07.273 --> 16:09.982
Whoa! Listen...

16:10.007 --> 16:11.280
Tearing down a statue at a school

16:11.304 --> 16:13.357
is a good way to get your first felony.

16:13.654 --> 16:16.107
What if they just marched
down to the principal's office?

16:16.255 --> 16:18.951
Just to let... Just to let
'em know how y'all feel?

16:19.435 --> 16:20.443
Much better.

16:20.552 --> 16:21.904
He's right. Come on, guys.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.186
Let's go to Ms. Turner's office

16:23.210 --> 16:24.530
and give her a piece of our mind.

16:27.474 --> 16:30.896
See? Letting him mix with real kids

16:31.771 --> 16:34.076
is gonna bust that
rich, privileged bubble.

16:34.482 --> 16:35.630
This is good.

16:39.983 --> 16:41.532
Shahzad, you okay?

16:41.826 --> 16:42.896
Sir, is there a problem?

16:43.013 --> 16:44.169
Yeah, this is my son!

16:44.638 --> 16:46.013
We cool. We cool, man.

16:46.326 --> 16:47.779
I understand protocol, man.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.028
The Rothman School?

16:55.582 --> 16:57.746
- The one in Park Slope?
- Yes, sir.

16:58.706 --> 17:00.378
Hey, I'm letting this one
go. He's not one of 'em.

17:00.402 --> 17:01.363
The hell he ain't.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.839
Really? This was his idea.

17:05.865 --> 17:06.877
Go.

17:07.790 --> 17:08.916
Get out of here.

17:09.964 --> 17:11.455
Yo, you really gonna leave?

17:31.878 --> 17:34.485
Thank you, Officer. Have a nice day.

17:36.487 --> 17:37.518
You okay?

17:38.569 --> 17:39.808
You all right?

17:40.794 --> 17:42.019
Why'd you let him go?

17:42.564 --> 17:44.644
Yo, what? Really?

17:47.168 --> 17:48.722
That was a punk-ass move you did.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.769
I don't feel good about it.

17:51.956 --> 17:53.886
It's not fair that they let me go.

17:55.863 --> 17:59.175
On the other hand, when I
seen you sitting there cuffed,

17:59.417 --> 18:00.737
and there was nothing I could do,

18:02.113 --> 18:04.003
but your privilege could, and it did it.

18:05.097 --> 18:07.878
You said my privilege
is part of the problem.

18:08.527 --> 18:11.824
Yeah, I know, but maybe
I was quick to diss it.

18:13.212 --> 18:14.354
Listen, Shahzad.

18:15.722 --> 18:18.197
Growing up, I didn't have any
of the stuff that you had, okay?

18:18.222 --> 18:20.072
I ended up exactly where my mother said

18:20.097 --> 18:21.511
I would go... to prison.

18:21.979 --> 18:23.120
But you different.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.042
Is your privilege fair? No.

18:25.806 --> 18:27.558
But neither is your
below-average height,

18:27.886 --> 18:29.183
and your bat-like vision.

18:29.589 --> 18:31.925
Use every advantage that you have.

18:32.628 --> 18:35.464
Just try to figure out how
to pull people up with you

18:35.581 --> 18:36.894
when you do use it, okay?

18:36.925 --> 18:39.371
I'm gonna be there to
help you. I promise.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.769
I love you.

18:44.386 --> 18:45.722
I love you, too.

18:50.761 --> 18:52.824
Ugh. I...

18:53.333 --> 18:55.253
I can't breathe.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.316
Don't worry. I had asthma, too.

19:03.523 --> 19:05.253
What do you think about food tonight?

19:05.359 --> 19:07.757
- What are you in the mood for?
- Ooh, I'd love that Indian place.

19:07.781 --> 19:08.781
Josh!

19:10.216 --> 19:11.265
Hey!

19:11.772 --> 19:12.788
You off somewhere?

19:12.988 --> 19:14.336
Yeah. Yes.

19:15.920 --> 19:16.920
Yeah.

19:16.999 --> 19:18.242
Aren't you gonna come down?

19:19.756 --> 19:20.772
Yeah.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.250
Yeah. Of course.

19:23.719 --> 19:24.839
- Hi.
- Great to see ya.

19:24.992 --> 19:26.187
Yeah, you, too.

19:26.254 --> 19:27.586
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

19:28.081 --> 19:29.143
Good to see you.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.289
- Nice to see you.
- My turn. Hi.

19:31.367 --> 19:32.945
I'm just gonna... come here.

19:33.031 --> 19:34.852
- No. Ow.
- Ow.

19:34.891 --> 19:37.078
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just hit... I'm fine.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.286
- Okay?
- I'm okay. It's...

19:38.311 --> 19:43.085
Honestly, um, it's just
that Shannon is kind of...

19:43.577 --> 19:46.217
you know, she... she doesn't want me

19:46.219 --> 19:49.147
kissing you hello or goodbye anymore.

19:49.835 --> 19:52.155
Sorry. Or anyone for that matter.

19:52.364 --> 19:54.161
I mean, there's nothing wrong with it,

19:54.186 --> 19:56.727
but it's not really her thing.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.818
It's not something that she is...

19:58.843 --> 20:00.364
- What's going on?
- Hi.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.266
Josh was just telling
us you have a problem

20:02.268 --> 20:04.780
with how friendly I can
be when I greet people.

20:04.858 --> 20:06.163
Oh, he put that on me, huh?

20:06.311 --> 20:07.741
We're so sorry if we offended you.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.888
The whole kissing thing
did throw me for a loop.

20:09.913 --> 20:11.138
I just don't know people that do that.

20:11.162 --> 20:13.489
I totally understand.
Sometimes I forget that.

20:13.514 --> 20:14.645
I grew up all over Europe,

20:14.647 --> 20:16.247
and I picked up on certain things,

20:16.249 --> 20:19.935
you know, like kissing on
the lips, nude sunbathing.

20:19.960 --> 20:20.998
Well, just so you know.

20:21.023 --> 20:22.663
I don't know people that
pull they titties out

20:22.687 --> 20:23.724
in public, either.

20:23.749 --> 20:25.257
Noted.

20:26.820 --> 20:29.687
- Sorry if I made it awkward earlier.
- Water under the bridge.

20:29.712 --> 20:31.265
Yeah, I know it didn't mean anything.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.898
Anyway, we should get out of your hair.

20:33.397 --> 20:34.694
- All right, well.
- Well, take care.

20:34.718 --> 20:36.467
- All right. You, too.
- Shake it out?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.091
Shake it out. Shake it out.

20:38.116 --> 20:39.388
Business. Deal.

20:39.413 --> 20:41.099
- Let me take this guy.
- See you later, man.

20:41.123 --> 20:42.203
Take care. Nice to see you.

20:43.483 --> 20:45.539
- Good to see you.
- But that meant something.

20:45.564 --> 20:46.964
- See you later. All righty.
- Okay.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.335
- Going for a walk!
- Enjoy that ride!

20:49.445 --> 20:51.210
- Going for a walk.
- Okay.

20:52.531 --> 20:53.937
That was nice, huh?
