(QUIETLY) Yeah, what other idiot
wants those colours?

31:20.860 --> 31:23.700
OK. Yeah.
Complicated work.

31:24.780 --> 31:26.340
Exactly.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.260
No, I have already
gone out on a limb for you.

31:29.260 --> 31:33.020
Yes, yes, you know all the best

OK.

If you can come up with 300 bucks,
I'll find another 150.

31:53.220 --> 31:53.460
If you can come up with 300 bucks,
From where?

31:53.460 --> 31:54.820
From where?

31:54.820 --> 31:56.260
I've got a piggybank.

31:56.260 --> 31:56.500
You'd do that?
I've got a piggybank.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.260
You'd do that?
Yeah.

31:58.260 --> 31:58.500
You'd do that?
But I want 10% of the profit.

32:01.860 --> 32:05.060

Oh, you've got someone else
2%.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.420

32:06.420 --> 32:08.180

We keep it simple
and use the rest on the shorts.

Getting killed in a stupid war
that nobody believes in?

42:26.780 --> 42:27.020
Getting killed in a stupid war
He could go to prison for this!

42:27.020 --> 42:28.420
He could go to prison for this!

42:28.420 --> 42:30.900
It's better
than him coming home in a box!

42:33.260 --> 42:35.460
Well, you tell him when you see him

42:35.460 --> 42:37.940
that, if he does run,
don't bother coming back.

42:37.940 --> 42:40.380
Yeah, well, that's fine
because he's already got a family.

Oh, oh, oh.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.500
Watch it. Hey!

43:06.500 --> 43:08.460
What are you doing here, Jules?

43:08.460 --> 43:10.980
Been looking for you two

43:10.980 --> 43:11.220
Been looking for you two
Just followed the music.

43:11.220 --> 43:12.620
Just followed the music.

43:12.620 --> 43:14.500
So, you're getting hitched
without me?

43:14.500 --> 43:14.740
So, you're getting hitched
Yeah, we're just keeping it small.

43:14.740 --> 43:16.980
Yeah, we're just keeping it small.

43:16.980 --> 43:18.420
Well, you should've invited me

43:18.420 --> 43:20.540

wedding present of anyone.

43:20.540 --> 43:20.780

Look, I'll stash these
Yes. Yes.

43:25.060 --> 43:25.300
Oh, is that the thanks I get
Yes. Yes.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.020
Oh, is that the thanks I get
for coming all the way out here?

43:27.020 --> 43:28.860
Yeah, thank you, Jules.
You promised me surfers.

43:28.860 --> 43:30.460
I did.
(CHUCKLES)

43:30.460 --> 43:32.060
Um... Come and have a drink.

43:32.060 --> 43:33.620
I might regret this.

43:33.620 --> 43:36.380
You look nice, Trace.
Thank you.

43:49.540 --> 43:52.900
Dani warned me
I should never trust a surfer.

43:52.900 --> 43:56.540
Surfing is always
more important than anything else.

43:56.540 --> 43:57.740
That's what they say.

43:58.980 --> 44:01.180
But not you.

44:03.780 --> 44:05.700
Why are you here?

44:05.700 --> 44:06.940
Well...

44:07.900 --> 44:10.260
..I think I came down here to...

44:11.380 --> 44:13.220
..try and talk you out of it.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.620
I do love Tracy.

44:18.820 --> 44:20.500
I hope so.

44:21.460 --> 44:23.820
You just married her.
Yeah.

44:25.580 --> 44:27.860
But you think
I'm doing the wrong thing.

44:27.860 --> 44:28.100
But you think
What I think doesn't matter anymore.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.740
What I think doesn't matter anymore.

44:40.340 --> 44:42.180
Uh... Ma...

45:10.980 --> 45:11.220
Yeah.
Trace, we were just talking.

45:11.220 --> 45:12.340
Yeah.
Trace?

45:12.340 --> 45:14.420
Don't treat me like an idiot.
No, we're friends, Tracy.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.220
I thought you met for just one night.
Hey...

45:16.220 --> 45:18.780
Or was that a lie too?
It was a big night and we bonded.

45:18.780 --> 45:19.020
Or was that a lie too?
Everyone did 'cause we were high.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.820
Everyone did 'cause we were high.

45:20.820 --> 45:22.740
You know how intense that can be.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.140
Yeah, so I see.

45:24.140 --> 45:25.140
Trace...

45:25.140 --> 45:26.740
You came back from Bali and...

45:26.740 --> 45:28.700
..and asked me to marry you
practically straightaway.

45:28.700 --> 45:28.940
..and asked me to marry you
I know.

45:28.940 --> 45:30.260
I know.

45:31.220 --> 45:33.180
And now I can...all I can think

45:33.180 --> 45:35.940
is that something happened with
Margaux and you were feeling guilty.

45:35.940 --> 45:36.180
is that something happened with
Well, that's not true!

45:36.180 --> 45:37.820
Well, that's not true!

Tracy.

45:41.660 --> 45:43.780
I never even wanted to get married,
Trot.

45:43.780 --> 45:46.820
You were the one pushing for it
this whole time!

45:46.820 --> 45:47.060
You were the one pushing for it
Yeah!

45:47.060 --> 45:48.020
Yeah!

45:49.940 --> 45:51.620
Come on.

45:51.620 --> 45:53.540
We've made it this far.

45:53.540 --> 45:55.940
Whatever it is you want to know,

45:55.940 --> 45:58.620
you ask me now

45:58.620 --> 46:00.540
and I promise
I will tell you the truth.

46:00.540 --> 46:00.780
and I promise
I promise.

46:00.780 --> 46:02.060
I promise.

No.

Shame Frank couldn't make it.
He'll come round.

47:21.460 --> 47:23.500
It'll just take some time.

You know, why'd he give us the money
if he wasn't even gonna show up?

What money?

I'll keep this very quick.

but, when I first met Trotter,

47:52.540 --> 47:54.300
I saved his life.

47:54.300 --> 47:55.780
It's true.

47:55.780 --> 47:57.540
He goes out into these waves

47:57.540 --> 47:59.620
that were just

47:59.620 --> 48:02.060
way beyond his skill level,

48:02.060 --> 48:04.500
because that's who he is, you know?

Huh?
Tracy?

51:59.860 --> 52:01.420
We needed the money, Trot!

What do you think? What do you think?

54:22.380 --> 54:24.860
It's gotta be a six. Yeah.
That's a nine, you numb-nut.

54:24.860 --> 54:26.900
It's a surf comp, Trace. I don't need
your husband's permission.

54:26.900 --> 54:28.740

You can't own the beach, Snap.

TRACY: I worked my arse off
while you were away.

DANI: You and Snap were headed

54:40.020 --> 54:42.260
Trace was just dumb enough
to get herself in the middle of it.

54:42.260 --> 54:42.500
Trace was just dumb enough
I surf better than you, old man.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.140
