WEBVTT

00:13.080 --> 00:14.160
May I?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.840
Rules are meant to be broken.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.120
Strap in, boys.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.920
But love has no rules.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.480
Who do you think you are?

00:27.560 --> 00:29.400
I love you, Anne.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.080
It's not enough.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.480
That's not enough for Anne Boleyn.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.160
Anne will go on
to change the whole of history.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.720
Did he actually say
he was going to marry you?

00:41.800 --> 00:43.080
'Course!

00:44.560 --> 00:45.560
More or less.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.520
She is an outspoken woman…

00:49.600 --> 00:53.920
One word from me,
and Henry will have your head for this.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.120
I wouldn't aim any higher if I were you.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.120
…in an age that doesn't really like women.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.240
We have brought the people closer to God
than they ever have been!

01:01.320 --> 01:02.320
Enough!

01:02.400 --> 01:05.560
Anne's ideas are very dangerous indeed.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.720
Anne Boleyn, how do you plead?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.160
Not guilty.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.280
Ah…

01:12.920 --> 01:13.840
Help.

01:17.080 --> 01:17.920
Help!

01:22.040 --> 01:23.600
He says it's all over.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.920
Like hell it is.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.480
It's cold in here. More wine?

01:56.080 --> 01:58.920
Thank you for agreeing
to talk to me again, Anne.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.200
Where shall we begin?

02:02.800 --> 02:03.960
The last time we spoke,

02:04.040 --> 02:06.880
I believe you were telling me
about your time at Amboise.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.280
I was sent to France

02:20.920 --> 02:23.520
not to find a husband, but to find myself.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.960
What really excited me was the buzz,

02:28.640 --> 02:30.360
the creative energy,

02:30.440 --> 02:32.720
the rebellion, the debate.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.600
When Anne Boleyn first arrives
in the French court,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.200
she's just a teenager,

03:00.280 --> 03:04.240
and she's completely unlike
most other women at the time.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.720
Thanks. Tighter.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.640
Anne.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.760
You really should get out more.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.240
It's party central here,
and all you do is sit and read.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.520
Her family have given her
this exceptional education.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.200
She's very precocious.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.840
She's an independent thinker,
quite bookish,

03:32.920 --> 03:36.600
with opinions of her own,
and she's not afraid to express them.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.800
Oh, King Francis has such good taste.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.760
Being a married man's mistress

03:41.840 --> 03:46.000
is like being in the midst of flames
without getting burned.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.720
I don't know what you're talking about.
Trust me.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.480
Some things you can't learn from books.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.440
Come on.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.800
Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister,

04:09.880 --> 04:14.280
is much more interested
in the immediate pleasures

04:14.360 --> 04:16.800
and the immediate satisfactions of things,

04:16.880 --> 04:19.720
whereas Anne,
she holds out for something more.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.160
King Francis,

04:33.240 --> 04:34.680
ruler of France,

04:34.760 --> 04:36.120
patron of the arts,

04:36.720 --> 04:38.560
and banging my sister.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.560
Sex and politics go hand-in-hand.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.600
At the French court,
it is a hotbed of sexual licentiousness.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.680
For young women like Anne and Mary Boleyn,

04:59.760 --> 05:02.160
it's wild, it's exciting, it's chaotic,

05:02.240 --> 05:04.640
but if you're not careful,
it's a little bit dangerous.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.120
Everywhere I looked,
women were getting screwed.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.680
Cheating husbands,

05:39.760 --> 05:41.880
controlling husbands,

05:41.960 --> 05:43.400
gambling husbands,

05:43.480 --> 05:45.160
or be a mistress,

05:45.240 --> 05:46.760
screwed with no husband.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.120
Would you take a mistress
if you were king?

06:05.920 --> 06:09.280
Wife for optics and heirs. Mistresses for…

06:09.880 --> 06:11.000
Everything else.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.760
Marguerite d'Angoulême,

06:20.840 --> 06:23.760
the beating heart
of the intellectual revolution.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.480
A geek-chic goddess.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.680
Marguerite of Angoulême
is the sister

06:29.760 --> 06:32.360
of Francis I, King of France.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.840
Marguerite has
a massive influence on Anne,

06:36.920 --> 06:40.040
encouraging her to embrace
her inner feminist.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.760
She also radicalizes Anne,

06:42.840 --> 06:46.720
encouraging her to question
the Catholic religion,

06:46.800 --> 06:50.120
introducing these quite extreme new ideas,

06:50.200 --> 06:52.680
which are actually incredibly dangerous.

06:54.040 --> 06:58.080
What she is interested in
is this movement

06:58.160 --> 07:00.240
towards reforming the Church.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.800
That means getting rid of all the ways

07:02.880 --> 07:05.640
in which the Church is grabbing money
from innocent people

07:05.720 --> 07:08.680
and promising them things
that they cannot deliver.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.800
Religious reform might sound boring today,

07:10.880 --> 07:15.040
but at the time, it's about making sure
that people have freedom

07:15.120 --> 07:16.720
to think for themselves.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.200
Have the courage
to forge your own path in life.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.040
Remember who you are

07:25.080 --> 07:26.360
and who you could be.

07:27.000 --> 07:27.840
Mm.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.280
It's France,
the year is 1520,

07:42.360 --> 07:47.360
and the most extravagant festival
Europe has ever witnessed is underway.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.880
Known as the Field of Cloth of Gold,

07:51.960 --> 07:55.120
this is a political summit
between England and France,

07:55.200 --> 07:58.280
who have been at war on and off
for many years.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.560
It cost nearly $20 million,

08:01.640 --> 08:05.840
and it would have been like
Woodstock on steroids.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.920
This isn't just a state occasion though.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.840
It's an incredibly hedonistic party.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.920
No, no, this is wrong. Gauche, ugly. Go!

08:22.240 --> 08:27.040
My dad, Thomas Boleyn, running the show.
Never share control with a Boleyn.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.600
The Boleyns aren't
from ancient aristocracy.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.240
They're social climbers,
they're well connected,

08:35.320 --> 08:39.680
and they are truly on the rise
in the court of Henry VIII.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.600
Anne, my sweet Anne.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.120
We've run out of wine.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.560
We need some wine for the King of England!

08:50.480 --> 08:54.320
Henry VIII
has been King of England for 11 years,

08:54.400 --> 08:57.000
and he's at the very height of his powers.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.320
Henry is very much an alpha male.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.800
He likes fighting and has a wild temper.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.240
-Well played, Your Majesty.
-Come on.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.840
Francis,
the first king of France,

09:10.920 --> 09:13.560
is Henry's fiercest rival,

09:13.640 --> 09:16.680
and each one wants to dominate the other.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.440
England and France have been
historical enemies for centuries.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.880
On top of this, Francis has
more of everything than Henry has.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.920
He has more wealth.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.120
He has more land.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.720
He has more mistresses.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.080
Come on, get him, sire. Yes!

10:06.960 --> 10:10.240
It's ridiculous.
It's like watching two pups play fight.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.320
Only slightly less adorable.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.240
Really?

10:22.600 --> 10:24.440
-Oh.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.360
What was so funny?

10:39.880 --> 10:41.360
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.000
To mock a king is treason.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.080
And to duel when drunk is foolish.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.760
Who are you?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.480
I'm Anne Boleyn.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.600
Anne Boleyn.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.480
Did I say you could go?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.120
<i>We </i>should go.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.600
I kept playing that moment
over and over again in my head.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.560
The way he looked at me.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.600
Like he wanted
to kiss or kill me.

11:36.080 --> 11:39.280
I didn't see Henry again
for another few years

11:39.360 --> 11:41.040
until I was back in England.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.800
King Henry VIII

11:53.880 --> 11:56.400
and Queen Katherine of Aragon.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.800
But my sister being my sister,

12:04.800 --> 12:06.560
she got together with Henry first.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.680
Mary does love a dalliance with a king,
a married king.

12:10.280 --> 12:14.160
My dad had big plans
to marry me off to my cousin.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.440
So, Cousin James, now you're back,
you'll be wanting to set up home.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.920
War was brutal.

12:21.720 --> 12:22.720
It's good to be back.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.040
I need to get myself settled.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.080
Sooner rather than later, I imagine.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.120
He'll be away on tour
most of the time, sis.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.360
You'll grow to love him.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.120
My little brother.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.720
My partner in crime
and fellow freethinker, George.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.840
Of course, since the injury,
I can't do much fighting.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.720
I'm stuck at home all the time.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.440
Full pension though.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.680
The King's finally decided

12:54.760 --> 12:58.160
to crack down
on those religious nutjobs though, eh?

12:58.240 --> 13:02.000
Four lads caught
reading the Bible in English.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.560
Latin too hard for them, is it?
Burn them all, I say.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.360
Oh, so people
who aren't rich enough to learn Latin

13:08.440 --> 13:10.200
deserve to be burned, do they?

13:10.720 --> 13:13.640
Well, some people believe
everybody has the right to read the Bible.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.480
-Why would it not be written in English?
-What Anne means--

13:16.560 --> 13:19.960
Boleyn, your daughter's a heretic.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.160
You have to understand
that at this time, in London,

13:24.240 --> 13:26.920
it's illegal to have a Bible in English.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.520
This is heresy.

13:28.600 --> 13:33.960
I mean, you can't just reinvent religion.
God told us to read the Bible in Latin.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.320
To say otherwise is total insanity.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.560
Henry Percy.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.600
Lust at first sight.

13:56.920 --> 14:01.160
Anne shows no enthusiasm
for her father's choice, James Butler,

14:01.240 --> 14:05.920
because she's already fallen in love
with a man called Henry Percy.

14:06.520 --> 14:10.280
Henry Percy is very close in age to Anne,

14:10.360 --> 14:13.400
but he's from one
of the highest-ranking families

14:13.480 --> 14:15.360
in the whole of England.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.800
He's way above Anne in status.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.640
Oh!

14:20.720 --> 14:22.880
Aren't you glad
I rescued you from that guy?

14:22.960 --> 14:25.960
Well, I don't need rescuing from anyone,
Mr. Percy,

14:26.040 --> 14:29.760
but if you want to call yourself
my knight in shining armor, then you can.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.080
It would be my honor.

14:37.640 --> 14:42.120
…in the street,
and I thought I recognized him.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.360
Cardinal Wolsey,

14:45.880 --> 14:49.320
King Henry's work wife
and court super snitcher.

14:50.480 --> 14:54.680
Cardinal Wolsey is
King Henry's right-hand man and confidant,

14:55.320 --> 14:59.200
and he is a supreme political operator,

14:59.280 --> 15:01.280
incredibly ruthless.

15:01.360 --> 15:05.760
Anne's pursuit of Percy
is highly problematic.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.920
His marriage plans
have already been laid out by his family

15:10.000 --> 15:11.640
and by Cardinal Wolsey.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.880
Wolsey has big plans for Henry Percy.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.280
He is going to propose a fantastic match,

15:16.360 --> 15:18.840
and it's going to benefit
different families,

15:18.920 --> 15:21.640
and it's going to be
a feather in the cap for Wolsey as well.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.840
The last thing he wants is
someone like Anne Boleyn walking in

15:24.920 --> 15:26.200
and muddying the waters.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.800
So Wolsey makes it his business
to get Anne out of the picture.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.560
Percy is sent away from court,

15:34.640 --> 15:36.640
much against Anne's wishes,

15:36.720 --> 15:38.840
and from that moment on,

15:38.920 --> 15:41.960
she sees Wolsey as enemy number one.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.040
I don't trust him one bit.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.360
Making a mockery
of the Boleyn name

16:02.440 --> 16:03.960
in front of the entire court.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.200
-What were you thinking?
-No one has any respect for my privacy.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.960
Don't be naive, Anne.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.880
Your love life was public
from the moment you were born.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.320
Until I can work out what to do with you,
you remain here.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.280
So what, I'm grounded?

16:20.840 --> 16:23.520
What's more important
than being with the one that you love?

16:25.800 --> 16:26.800
Duty.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.680
Anne falls in love just like we do today,

16:30.760 --> 16:33.560
but the difference is
she doesn't get to choose her husband.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.400
It's Thomas Boleyn's fault

16:35.480 --> 16:38.520
that he has actually raised
such a headstrong and willful daughter

16:38.600 --> 16:42.320
and certainly someone
who wants to negotiate her own destiny.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.680
That is entirely at his door.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.320
You can't possibly have read all these.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.440
Well, it's what you read in life
that determines who you are.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.960
Mm, well, like I've always said,

16:56.040 --> 16:59.640
some of the biggest lessons in life
you don't learn from books.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.320
Mary had been
having an affair with Henry

17:02.400 --> 17:04.520
for some time by this point,

17:04.600 --> 17:06.000
and she's pregnant.

17:06.600 --> 17:07.560
Have you told Henry?

17:07.640 --> 17:09.080
He doesn't want to know,

17:09.600 --> 17:12.120
even though he's desperate
for a male heir.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.120
A legitimate one, obviously.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
The truth is,
I don't know if it's actually his.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.520
Oh, Mary!

17:23.400 --> 17:26.040
Of course,
if that boy was Henry's,

17:26.120 --> 17:28.680
it would be a bastard, illegitimate,

17:28.760 --> 17:31.640
and so unable to inherit the throne.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.600
Don't feel sorry for me, Anne.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.880
There's nothing I want more right now
than to be a good mother.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.400
It still feels really wrong
that he's just cut you off like this.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.600
It's an age-old problem.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.280
Men have affairs and can walk away,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.240
whereas women live with the consequences.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.920
But it doesn't make it right.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.680
When has what's right ever mattered?

18:16.720 --> 18:17.640
This.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.600
Oh!

18:21.440 --> 18:24.840
Oh, all dressed up and nowhere to go.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.640
Jane Boleyn, my brother's wife.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.680
Typical sister-in-law.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.880
Caught her red-handed, Miss Anne.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.480
Stupid, this one.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.280
Can't wait for this.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.760
Actually I lent her the book.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.600
Return it at supper time like we agreed.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.280
Saint Anne.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.240
How dare you.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.200
That kind of book
shouldn't even be in this house.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.080
She's free to choose,

19:03.160 --> 19:05.960
and if I see anything like that again,
you'll be sent packing.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.320
The sorts of books
that Anne is reading

19:08.400 --> 19:10.280
are deeply controversial.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.440
They're going against
the established order,

19:12.520 --> 19:13.720
the established religion.

19:13.800 --> 19:18.720
Anne is very influenced by what
the new generation are starting to think,

19:18.800 --> 19:20.800
that everyone should understand the Bible,

19:20.880 --> 19:23.400
that the body of Christ is not in a wafer,

19:23.480 --> 19:26.720
that everyone can speak to God
on their own terms.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.920
But she can't say any of this out loud.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.040
And even worse, by sharing these ideas,

19:32.120 --> 19:33.960
she's increasing the risk

19:34.040 --> 19:37.200
that someone will betray her
to the authorities.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.720
Family, listen. News just in.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.400
Dad's found me the perfect man.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.080
-Sadly no.

19:54.160 --> 19:58.240
The King has finally rewarded me
for my obvious loyalty.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.920
Drumroll, please.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.040
You are looking at
the new Viscount Rochford.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.560
-Ah!

20:07.640 --> 20:09.440
That sounds so impressive.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.120
-Always happy to hang onto your coattails.
-Yes.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.520
Well, someone's got to progress
your career.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.400
Does that mean I get to go back to court?

20:17.480 --> 20:21.400
-I'll give it some thought.
-And find that perfect man myself.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.800
Don't push it.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.480
I'm sure you'll find
a good match one day, Anne.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.640
Someone who will love and look after you

20:28.720 --> 20:31.520
and take you off my hands.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.840
That's the plan.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.440
So after a year or two
at Hever, Anne returns to court.

20:37.520 --> 20:41.120
She takes back her former position
as lady-in-waiting.

20:58.000 --> 20:58.840
Oh.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.240
You're back.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.440
Katherine of Aragon,

21:05.520 --> 21:07.600
King Henry's long-suffering wife.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.120
Spanish, spirited,

21:09.200 --> 21:12.360
commanded an entire army
on horseback while pregnant.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.000
Respect.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.200
Katherine
is the pinnacle of European royalty.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.640
She's the daughter
of the powerful monarchs of Spain.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.600
She's also greatly beloved
of the people of England,

21:25.680 --> 21:27.360
and her marriage to Henry

21:27.440 --> 21:31.120
is one of the greatest political alliances
in Europe.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.480
Sensing hostile vibes.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.360
Wasn't you that banged her husband.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.920
Lady Worcester, AKA Lady W.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.240
My bestie. Knows me better than I do.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.440
How dare you bring me this news?

21:52.800 --> 21:54.720
The heretics will fall in line.

21:54.800 --> 21:58.800
The idea that the Bible
should be read in English is outrageous.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.800
It's evil!
Latin is the language of God's word.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.520
The pope, the supreme head of the Church,
commands it.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.560
Tudor England is Catholic.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.160
Henry VIII is Catholic.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.560
He is deeply pious.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.480
He is the golden poster boy
for English Catholicism,

22:12.560 --> 22:16.280
and he firmly believes
that the Bible should be read in Latin.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.280
These friars are out of control,

22:18.960 --> 22:21.080
deserting God's kingdom
and Christ's faith.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.080
They're… They're wallowing in lust
with Luther.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.880
There's a man called William Tyndale

22:24.960 --> 22:27.680
who has translated the New Testament
into English,

22:27.760 --> 22:29.760
and he's on the run
from the King of England.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.840
Heresy!

22:31.480 --> 22:34.800
Heresy is the plague of England,
and I'm not prepared to tolerate it.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.680
I want that book shoved
so far up the friar's backside

22:37.760 --> 22:40.000
that he chokes on his own blasphemy.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.720
The idea
that someone themselves

22:42.800 --> 22:45.400
could read the sacred writing

22:45.480 --> 22:47.400
and make up their own interpretation

22:47.480 --> 22:50.000
rather than having to rely on the Church

22:50.080 --> 22:52.800
to tell them what was right and wrong,
this is dangerous.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.560
What are you waiting for? Get out!

22:56.240 --> 22:58.560
It suggests
the possibility of anarchy,

22:58.640 --> 23:00.160
of people thinking for themselves.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.160
AB.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.960
It's been a while.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.840
I was just a little boy
the last time we met.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.040
Always keen on you though.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.120
I prefer older women.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.920
Sir Thomas Wyatt.

23:21.440 --> 23:25.200
Known for his poetry,
but certainly not his chat-up lines.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.560
I'm two years older than you, Wyatt.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.000
Yes. Well, I--

23:34.600 --> 23:35.520
You.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.240
I remember you.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.560
And I remember you, Your Majesty.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.320
Anne Boleyn, isn't it?

23:44.360 --> 23:45.840
Mm, well…

23:49.520 --> 23:51.520
I hope to see more of you

23:51.600 --> 23:53.400
now that you're back at court.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.320
With your shirt on this time presumably.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.960
The thing about Anne is

24:07.040 --> 24:09.880
she is an outspoken woman.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.360
She's feisty

24:11.440 --> 24:14.760
in an age that doesn't really like women
to be that outspoken.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.600
Life choices for women
are limited in the 16th century.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.200
They can be a wife,
a mistress, a nun, or a spinster.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.080
Anne wants something more.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.040
No chance!

24:37.120 --> 24:37.960
May I?

24:38.040 --> 24:39.360
Not a chance.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.040
Strap in, boys.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.800
-Well played.
-Well played.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.000
-Now, one more time.
-That was not beginner's luck.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.160
-Beginner's luck.
-No!

24:54.240 --> 24:56.800
-Of course it was.
-I think it probably was.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.440
Yes!

25:00.520 --> 25:01.480
All right.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.240
-Ha-ha-ha!
-Well played, Your Majesty.

25:09.320 --> 25:10.400
Where's my prize?

25:11.600 --> 25:12.920
No prizes in this game.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.960
Oh, I'm the King. I make the rules.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.080
Mwah!

25:30.800 --> 25:32.200
The real prize.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.560
We kept catching each other's eye
in court.

25:52.040 --> 25:56.400
Never intended for anything
to actually happen.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.840
Respectable Anne Boleyn would never,

26:00.400 --> 26:03.040
especially given what had happened
with my sister.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.480
But it was fun though.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.880
Three points!

26:13.960 --> 26:16.400
Beau of Portland!

26:19.560 --> 26:23.920
Henry's whole identity
is based on his masculinity,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.320
and nothing portrays that
more than a joust,

26:28.400 --> 26:29.960
which Henry excels in.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.240
Nice seats.

26:43.760 --> 26:47.520
Yeah. I'm not a fan of jousting.
Somebody always gets hurt.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.120
I can't watch.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.160
What's that about?

27:28.200 --> 27:29.840
"Declare, I dare not."

27:33.760 --> 27:35.120
What's he declaring?

27:40.720 --> 27:41.560
Really?

27:49.440 --> 27:51.320
"Declare, I dare not."

27:51.400 --> 27:55.560
I mean, it's such an odd
and mysterious message, isn't it,

27:55.640 --> 27:56.840
to be sending to the court

27:56.920 --> 28:00.120
and to be sending to the woman
who's watching you joust,

28:00.200 --> 28:01.800
sort of in her honor?

28:01.880 --> 28:06.600
It's this, "I'm not yet going to say
your name, but you know my heart."

28:06.680 --> 28:10.520
It's a massive signal to everybody.
"Okay, I have a new love interest."

28:10.600 --> 28:13.680
It's a little awkward,
because your wife is sitting right there,

28:13.760 --> 28:15.320
but this is how Henry works.

28:20.360 --> 28:24.080
First time it felt real

28:25.080 --> 28:26.800
was that day at the jousting.

28:28.360 --> 28:31.960
But I didn't want to let myself
get too excited.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.240
I didn't want to let myself believe it.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.160
He does this with all the girls, right?

28:39.360 --> 28:41.720
He did it with Mary. He'd do it with me.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.800
I wasn't special.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.320
But then came the letters.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.440
"For over a year now,
I've been struck with the dart of love,

28:58.520 --> 29:02.080
and I'm not yet sure
whether I have a place in your heart."

29:02.160 --> 29:04.040
Well, Henry's got it bad, then?

29:05.160 --> 29:06.640
Clearly not the only one.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.200
-And he sent me this.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.120
Let's see.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.520
Yeah, and this as well,
and I'm seeing him tonight.

29:14.040 --> 29:14.880
-Ouch!
-Ooh.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.200
-Ooh!
-Oh.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.400
Love is a dangerous game, Anne!

29:20.560 --> 29:21.840
-Uh-oh.
-Hmm?

29:30.520 --> 29:32.440
What do I have to do
to get some attention?

29:33.360 --> 29:35.000
Still not interested, Wyatt.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.320
-Oh! We'd make a great team.
-But you're married. End of.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.000
-So is the King.
-And I'm not <i>his </i>mistress either!

29:46.880 --> 29:47.920
No, no, give it back!

29:48.000 --> 29:49.560
-Uh-uh-uh!
-Give it back!

29:50.320 --> 29:52.840
Doesn't Queen Katherine have one
just like this?

29:53.560 --> 29:54.600
Ugh!

29:55.560 --> 29:57.240
You can come get it later!

29:57.760 --> 29:59.720
Anne must be shocked and horrified

29:59.800 --> 30:03.360
when Wyatt pulls the necklace
off her neck.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.040
Jewelry is understood
by the whole Tudor court

30:06.120 --> 30:08.080
as being deeply symbolic.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
Henry is gifting Anne jewels,

30:11.160 --> 30:15.120
and by doing so,
he's almost marking out his territory.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.080
-Oh-ho!
-Very good.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.200
Well done, well done,
well done, well done.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.480
Hmm.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.840
Oh!

30:26.920 --> 30:28.120
Unlucky, sire.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.560
The next game will be mine.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.040
You're the game, by the way.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.280
Actually,

30:45.960 --> 30:47.840
I believe this game is already mine.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.920
Henry fetishizes virginity.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.640
He cares about Katherine of Aragon
being a virgin when he marries her.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.840
He cares that Anne is a virgin,

31:06.920 --> 31:09.720
because it means
he's the first man to have her.

31:10.240 --> 31:14.640
And so the idea
that Wyatt might have been near her,

31:14.720 --> 31:19.080
it creates the sense
of a little bit of doubt.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.800
And in her first book,
didn't she claim to say that--

31:21.880 --> 31:23.360
-Yes.
-He did! Thank you…

32:24.240 --> 32:26.240
I didn't give him the necklace.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.160
He stole it.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.880
I need to be able to trust you, Anne.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.280
<i>You </i>trust <i>me?</i>

32:36.880 --> 32:38.920
Well, what about
what you did to my sister?

32:41.120 --> 32:43.800
Mary made it clear
the child may not be mine.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.880
And if I'm not mistaken,

32:46.680 --> 32:49.800
I'm by no means the first king
she's been acquainted with.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.840
Well, with your hot temper
and hatred of heretics,

32:56.440 --> 32:57.600
why <i>should </i>I trust you?

33:02.720 --> 33:03.600
You can't.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.440
May I?

33:26.520 --> 33:27.400
No.

33:28.960 --> 33:29.960
Don't fight it.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.200
No, for so many reasons.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.760
I can't think of one good reason
not to kiss you.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.960
But that's not what we're talking about,
is it?

33:46.720 --> 33:47.720
I want you.

33:54.040 --> 33:54.960
I know.

34:02.920 --> 34:03.800
This time,

34:05.680 --> 34:07.320
we play by my rules.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.320
Addicted,

34:24.920 --> 34:27.000
right there in that moment.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.400
But I couldn't do it.

34:33.160 --> 34:34.800
I couldn't let him kiss me.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.280
I had a reputation to consider.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.720
A husband to find, a life to think about.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.240
Ever tried saying no to a man like Henry?

34:44.240 --> 34:46.920
No use, because he won't listen.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.240
So I decided to walk away.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.160
Go home.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.560
<i>I can't stop thinking about you</i>
<i>every second of every day.</i>

35:06.640 --> 35:07.520
<i>Was this your plan?</i>

35:08.640 --> 35:12.000
<i>Retreat to Hever and see me in agony</i>
<i>with how much I miss you?</i>

35:12.520 --> 35:14.280
<i>If that's what you wanted,</i>
<i>it's worked, Anne,</i>

35:14.360 --> 35:18.120
<i>because I would do anything just to spend</i>
<i>a single minute with you right now.</i>

35:18.960 --> 35:21.920
<i>You must feel</i>
<i>this pain of separation the way I do.</i>

35:23.080 --> 35:24.320
<i>We had something.</i>

35:25.760 --> 35:29.000
<i>What possible reason could be big enough</i>
<i>to keep you from my arms?</i>

35:33.560 --> 35:35.480
We know from Henry's letters

35:35.560 --> 35:38.040
that Anne doesn't always write back to him

35:38.120 --> 35:39.440
when he writes to her.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.280
We don't know
if she is playing a long game here,

35:44.360 --> 35:45.440
if this is strategic,

35:45.520 --> 35:49.880
or actually if this is just a sense
of not knowing what to do

35:49.960 --> 35:53.400
and being overwhelmed with this attention.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.720
These letters get pretty explicit.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.760
I told Norfolk
it's 'cause you're holding the wrong end!

36:09.320 --> 36:10.920
Do you think he killed it himself?

36:11.920 --> 36:14.720
Well, they say the way to your heart
is through your stomach.

36:14.800 --> 36:18.640
Henry sends Anne venison,
that's the meat of a deer,

36:18.720 --> 36:19.800
and he says,

36:19.880 --> 36:22.440
"When you put this flesh in your mouth,
think of me."

36:23.280 --> 36:26.120
I think it's quite clear
what he's saying.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.120
Well, it's done the job for me.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.680
-What a romantic gesture.
-This came with the buck.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.920
Are you going to read it, or should I?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.120
Anne, you do it.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.240
Yes, go on. We're all ears.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.520
Wah.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.200
"Anne. It's been a year now."

36:44.280 --> 36:47.800
"Come on, you've made your point.
You've turned me into a desperate man."

36:47.880 --> 36:50.920
"I'm making a fool of myself now,
and you know it

36:51.000 --> 36:53.120
and are possibly even enjoying it."

36:53.200 --> 36:56.520
"I'm starting to wonder if you ever
really liked me in the first place."

36:56.600 --> 36:57.840
Oh, you tease.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.000
"I have to know, will you be my…"

37:04.360 --> 37:05.280
Go on.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.760
"…will you be my mistress?"

37:13.960 --> 37:17.320
"It would be exclusive.
I'll happily get rid of all the others."

37:17.400 --> 37:19.000
-"It'd just be you."
-Stop.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.520
At least he has a type.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.160
I thought we had something special.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.960
Sweetheart, you must have realized
what he was after.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.600
No, no. I will never be anyone's mistress.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.360
You're unbelievable.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.960
Anne can't quite believe
that Henry still doesn't get it.

37:45.040 --> 37:48.360
She has no intention
of being his mistress.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.440
It is such an anticlimax for her.
She's worth more than this.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.680
She has been raised
to be something brilliant.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.480
Henry's going to have to come up
with a lot better than that.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.440
You okay?

38:14.800 --> 38:17.080
Dad's right. He was only after one thing.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.120
Well, I'm sure that's not true.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.080
How could he not
fall in love with you, Anne?

38:25.360 --> 38:26.840
I thought maybe he did

38:27.800 --> 38:28.640
love me.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.360
I almost let myself believe it could work.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.080
I even thought
of what it might be like to be--

38:34.160 --> 38:35.040
What, queen?

38:35.840 --> 38:39.800
Yeah! For one moment of madness,
I actually thought about it.

38:40.720 --> 38:44.440
Think of all that you could do with it.
You could make change for the better.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.240
Change that really matters.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.600
And the shoes.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.080
-Think of the shoes.
-Shut up!

38:57.160 --> 38:58.880
You would make a great queen.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.600
But he already has one, Anne.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.120
And the people love Katherine.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.080
I'll write back.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.720
Tell him he can stick his proposition
up Wolsey's cassock

39:15.800 --> 39:17.400
and never contact me again.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.600
Come here.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.640
-You're the only man I need, George.
-Mm.

39:34.680 --> 39:41.560
Anne is playing with fire
in choosing to taunt the King of England.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.680
Her family's entire financial position,

39:45.760 --> 39:50.320
their status, their opportunities,
all depend on Henry's favor.

39:50.400 --> 39:54.760
So by choosing to be… willful

39:54.840 --> 39:58.000
and defending her own self,

39:58.080 --> 40:01.440
she's actually putting
her entire family at risk.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.680
We need to talk.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.040
There's nothing to talk about.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.960
I wrote you letters, lots of letters.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.240
And I replied.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.040
Were my terms not good enough?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.160
Your terms humiliated me.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.440
How dare you?

40:26.200 --> 40:27.520
You'd want for nothing.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.920
And what would you know about what I want?

40:30.000 --> 40:33.360
Do you know what it means
to be loved by the King of England?

40:33.440 --> 40:36.280
Yes, it means you're a mistress,
it means that your future is done.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.120
-You don't get to do that to me.
-I love you, Anne!

40:42.600 --> 40:43.640
I love you.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.760
And I thought you felt the same.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.800
It's not enough.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.880
That's not enough for Anne Boleyn.

41:03.520 --> 41:04.920
Is it enough for you?

41:13.840 --> 41:16.320
Whatever this is… was,

41:18.640 --> 41:19.560
it's over.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.080
You need to go.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.680
You're making a big mistake.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.880
You foolish girl.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.840
Just thrown away your future,
your family's future.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.240
Everything we've worked for!

41:59.440 --> 42:00.600
What have you done?
