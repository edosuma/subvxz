WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.915
Previously onDynasty...

00:02.959 --> 00:04.178
We have news
to celebrate.

00:04.221 --> 00:06.267
Last night,
asked Cristal to marry me

00:06.310 --> 00:07.224
and she said yes.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.051
ALEXIS:
Where are you, Hank?

00:08.095 --> 00:09.052
I don't know who the hell

00:09.096 --> 00:10.053
this Claudia is

00:10.097 --> 00:11.315
or why I have her baby,

00:11.359 --> 00:13.100
but you need to come
and get it right now.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.928
I'm folding... Done.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.234
You're not going anywhere.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.454
I'll let go of the club
and your blackmail,

00:19.497 --> 00:21.673
if you do one last thing.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.675
I need you to pick
something up for me.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.722
Oh, my God.ALEXIS: Sam found a baby
in the manger.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.071
JENNINGS:
I have a favor to ask.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.464
Could you pop by
Alexis's trailer

00:29.507 --> 00:31.118
and check her size for me?

00:31.161 --> 00:32.293
What the hell?

00:32.336 --> 00:33.903
What was your name again?

00:33.946 --> 00:36.166
Manuel. I babysit a lot.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.385
How'd you like to stick around,
Manny?

00:37.428 --> 00:39.778
I want us to get married
as soon as we can

00:39.822 --> 00:41.563
so I never have to be scared
of losing you again.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.391
I don't ever want
to lose you, either.

00:46.176 --> 00:49.701
PLANNER:
The fairytale bride
is a walking dream.

00:49.745 --> 00:52.139
The epitome of
happily ever after.

00:52.182 --> 00:55.272
Feels a little too
damsel-in-distress-y for me.

00:55.316 --> 00:58.623
Unless she's wearing mesh
and lace garters under there.

00:58.667 --> 00:59.842
Is she?

00:59.885 --> 01:02.105
No Next.

01:02.149 --> 01:05.282
The glam rock bride dazzles,
never fades.

01:05.326 --> 01:08.024
A bright star with
a lust for life.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.200
Mm. Okay. No. No.

01:10.244 --> 01:14.248
I love the fur, but the glitter
is way too Tonya Harding. Next.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.163
What is all of this?

01:16.206 --> 01:17.903
Hey, there you are.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.340
I've had our wedding planner
put together

01:19.383 --> 01:21.211
some human Pinterest boards,

01:21.255 --> 01:22.256
so we can visualize
our big day.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.605
It's a little
bit over-the-top.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.694
Do we need such an
extravagant wedding?

01:25.737 --> 01:27.217
Well, it's a celebration of us.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.480
And how much we'll spend
to celebrate us.

01:29.524 --> 01:32.004
But don't worry.
I can afford it.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.702
SAM:
These are not items

01:33.745 --> 01:35.747
you typically find
in someone's trailer, Alexis.

01:35.791 --> 01:38.359
You obviously had something to
do with Little Blake's arrival.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.187
You caught me, Sam.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.494
It was Hank who left
the baby at my doorstep.

01:43.538 --> 01:44.756
He was here?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.584
You're telling me

01:46.628 --> 01:49.457
my precious baby is that...

01:49.500 --> 01:52.373
murdering pyro's child?

01:52.416 --> 01:54.114
Hank apparently
knocked up this woman

01:54.157 --> 01:55.680
who was an unfit mother, and...

01:55.724 --> 01:58.118
Well, that's a gene pool
that should be contained.

01:58.161 --> 02:01.773
No offense. I know
he's your grandson.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.297
You must understand.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.820
Your father was a murderer.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.256
But Blake?

02:06.300 --> 02:07.605
He'll never look at LB the same.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.651
Fine. I'll keep it
between us.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.783
So it's agreed.
Not a word.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.350
Not a word to Blake or Cristal

02:13.394 --> 02:15.700
or, or Child
Protective Services.

02:15.744 --> 02:18.181
But didn't you call them?Well, I couldn't.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.966
I-I couldn't risk them tracing
the baby back to Hank,

02:21.010 --> 02:22.229
and putting the spotlight
on the family. I...

02:22.272 --> 02:24.361
Please. You have
to keep pretending

02:24.405 --> 02:25.667
that they're on their way.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.800
Whatever it takes
to keep Little Blake happy

02:28.844 --> 02:31.847
and safe and with me.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.502
The whole
antebellum theme

02:34.545 --> 02:36.417
is giving me Get Out
vibes.

02:36.460 --> 02:40.377
Ooh, no. No.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.640
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.773
Since you're in the process

02:44.816 --> 02:46.209
of planning your wedding,
I'd like to request

02:46.253 --> 02:47.776
that I give the last toast
after your brother.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.734
We should skip your
mother altogether.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.215
Also, I was thinking,
in the spirit of new beginnings,

02:52.259 --> 02:54.261
you should make Cristal
a bridesmaid.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.741
Oh. Are we
discussing the wedding?

02:56.785 --> 02:58.917
Well, I've been working
on my guest list,

02:58.961 --> 03:02.399
and I've whittled my "must"
invites down to 350.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.271
Everyone, this is Manuel,

03:04.314 --> 03:06.229
the new manny.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.405
Manny the manny?
That can't be real.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.233
Can you make sure he gets
a seat at the adult table?

03:10.277 --> 03:11.843
And also, I'd
really appreciate it

03:11.887 --> 03:13.541
if you could ban other guests
from wearing leopard print.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.238
That's kind of my aesthetic.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.415
No. No. No. To everyone.

03:18.459 --> 03:22.898
Your job will be to simply show
up and shut up. In that order.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.467
CRISTAL:
Fallon is right.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.339
It's her special day and we
should do whatever she wants.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.036
Thank you, new Cristal.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.560
Okay. Everybody out.

03:32.603 --> 03:33.691
Except for Culhane.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.563
We need to find
our iconic venue.

03:35.606 --> 03:39.262
Hi, you.
Aw.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.699
Look, he's
smiling for Grandma.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.397
You'll meet
Mrs. Gunnerson.
She's good.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.876
She'll help you with
anything you need.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.530
She's...Sam.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.577
Did you manage to get Alexis'
sweater size from her trailer?

03:54.712 --> 03:57.062
Ah.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.638
Was there anything else
you need?

04:07.682 --> 04:09.336
No. Thank you.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.773
You've been really helpful.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.383
This is cute.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.299
[Sam and Manuel
speak indistinctly]

04:17.344 --> 04:18.606
What did you do to Sam?

04:18.649 --> 04:21.391
They should tie a bell

04:21.435 --> 04:22.958
around your furry
little neck.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.743
He said nothing about finding
the baby Jesus in your RV.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.267
I can tell he's lying.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.703
Maybe I should tell Blake.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.139
Without proof?

04:30.182 --> 04:32.446
He'll think you're
an insecure lunatic

04:32.489 --> 04:34.709
that's got it out for
his stunning ex-wife.

04:34.752 --> 04:37.320
We're still engaged.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.322
Even after you told him
everything I did.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.063
You know, Blake's pantalones

04:41.106 --> 04:42.934
may tighten at the
thought of you now,

04:42.978 --> 04:45.415
but in time,
they're gonna deflate.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.461
And since you're not
gonna be here for long,

04:47.504 --> 04:49.550
don't bother sucking up
to my daughter.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.334
What are you talking about?

04:51.378 --> 04:54.163
I saw the way you smooch
her ass.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.513
And if there's one thing
that I will never allow,

04:56.557 --> 04:58.385
it's for you to get
close to my children.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.387
Oh, I get it.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.519
Your kids are all you have left.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.913
You've lost your husband,
your friends,

05:04.956 --> 05:07.394
your place in society.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.917
You're practically a leper.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.701
Enjoy the caviar.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.051
I can always get you more.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.531
PLANNER:
The Hildebrand
just remodeled.

05:14.575 --> 05:17.491
They have a rotating restaurant.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.536
That's nice... if I want to get
married on a merry-go-round.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.059
Ugh. Tacky.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.932
Ugly. Wait.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.368
Is that the Swan House?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.457
PLANNER:
Built in 1928.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.111
It's one of Atlanta's
most historic estates.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.461
Oh. Grandma Carrington
got married there.

05:31.505 --> 05:32.723
It's so beautiful.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.159
Oh, you were close
to her, weren't you?

05:34.203 --> 05:35.509
That would be special,

05:35.552 --> 05:37.293
to get married
where she did.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.730
Special and deeply personal.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.428
It's the only option.

05:41.471 --> 05:45.214
Unfortunately, there's another
wedding booked that evening.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.521
Would you consider
moving the date?

05:47.564 --> 05:49.000
No. Absolutely not.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.567
And we've already sent out
save-the-dates,

05:50.611 --> 05:51.960
and it would cause
way too much speculation,

05:52.003 --> 05:54.571
what with my recent divorce--
well, divorces--

05:54.615 --> 05:56.573
and the accelerated engagement--
no.

05:56.617 --> 05:57.966
Who booked it?

05:58.009 --> 05:59.794
Mimi Rose Prescott.

05:59.837 --> 06:02.274
Mimi Rose.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.972
She's an insipid
Southern socialite

06:04.015 --> 06:05.843
who's been married like, what,
five times?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.279
Maybe I can convince her
to skip this one.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.498
Do you even know her?

06:08.542 --> 06:11.632
No, but I know someone
who does.

06:11.675 --> 06:14.591
â™ª

06:14.635 --> 06:17.551
Not to interrupt your paint
by numbers: the deceased series,

06:17.594 --> 06:19.553
but I want the Swan House
for my wedding venue,

06:19.596 --> 06:20.771
and guess who has it booked

06:20.815 --> 06:22.120
for their wedding
on the very same day?

06:22.164 --> 06:24.035
It's not me. I swear.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.515
Mimi Rose Prescott.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.952
I vaguely recall her being part
of your cabal of blonde,

06:27.996 --> 06:30.868
big-haired head cases that
you used to slither with.Mmm.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.479
I do know Mimi.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.306
Well, yay.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.570
Maybe you can set up a face-off,
and we can convince her

06:36.613 --> 06:37.832
that she doesn't need
to get married there.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.487
Do you remember just
a couple of hours ago,

06:40.530 --> 06:42.663
you said you did not want
any family involvement?

06:42.706 --> 06:46.884
Because it surely seems like
you're asking me for help.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.451
I'm not gonna beg you.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.540
Hmm. I should get back
to my painting.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.326
Please, Mother,
I need your help.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.329
Well, that's not great,
but it'll do.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.636
Look at us.
Joining forces.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.465
The two of us riding
into battle together.Relax.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.468
We're meeting with a woman,
not overthrowing the Lannisters.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.514
â™ª

07:30.188 --> 07:31.625
It's ungentlemanly
of you to keep me waiting.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.670
I was busy.With wedding planning?

07:33.714 --> 07:36.456
It's the talk of the town.

07:36.499 --> 07:37.718
Aren't you glad I rescued you

07:37.761 --> 07:40.111
from that sleep-inducing
lace and tulle talk?

07:40.155 --> 07:42.070
Look, I'm only doing this job
because you promised me

07:42.113 --> 07:45.247
the blackmail on Fallon and
the video of Jeff's poker game.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.857
I'm not letting another
disaster like the one

07:46.901 --> 07:48.293
that happened at
the club happen again.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.078
The disaster you caused?

07:50.121 --> 07:53.211
Surely, you're a man who takes
responsibility for his actions.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.997
Or have years of being Fallon's
errand boy worn your ass down?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.999
My ass is doing just fine,

07:58.042 --> 07:59.914
thank you very much.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.089
I like you, Michael.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.699
That's why I want to help you.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.484
All you need to do is pick up
a shipment of antiques for me,

08:04.527 --> 08:05.659
and then you're done.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.878
A "shipment of antiques"?

08:07.922 --> 08:10.011
That doesn't sound
shady at all.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.535
Everything's taken care of.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.450
The only thing you need to do
is drive.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.018
As long as that's all
I'm doing, then we're good.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.498
You deliver for me

08:18.541 --> 08:21.501
and I deliver for you,
your freedom.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.199
MIMI ROSE:
It's been so long, Alexis.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.984
I remember Fallon as just
a sweet little thing.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.856
Oh, no. Must've been
a different Fallon.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.685
When did we last talk

08:31.728 --> 08:33.861
No... the yacht in Majorca.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.515
We pushed old Savannah Gates

08:35.558 --> 08:37.473
overboard. Oh, my God.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.476
She would've drowned if her
implants hadn't kept her afloat.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.696
Oh, I would've called
on you sooner,

08:42.739 --> 08:44.872
but I have been overwhelmed
with my charities.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.701
Mm. I remember those
lovely galas.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.181
I almost invited you
to the last one,

08:50.225 --> 08:52.444
but then I thought it might be
awkward for you

08:52.488 --> 08:54.490
to be out in society,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.448
being between homes and single.

08:56.492 --> 08:59.364
Oh, I've been preoccupied,
renovating my loft,

08:59.408 --> 09:02.977
and, well,
planning Fallon's wedding.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.326
I'm getting married, too.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.632
Oh, look at that.

09:05.675 --> 09:06.763
It's gonna be
at the Swan House.

09:06.807 --> 09:07.808
That old place?

09:07.851 --> 09:08.852
Oh, dear.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.158
What's wrong?

09:10.201 --> 09:12.769
Well, you've always been
so avant-garde, and,

09:12.813 --> 09:14.423
well, that old house
is well-trafficked

09:14.466 --> 09:17.861
like a drive-through
wedding chapel these days.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.994
FALLON: Yes. And so over-filmed.
In The Hunger Games,

09:20.037 --> 09:22.431
it was a mass-murdering
dictator's home. Mm.

09:22.474 --> 09:25.477
Yeah. I just see you
somewhere more lavish...

09:25.521 --> 09:26.914
Unexpected.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.132
Do you still have that friend
over at Hildebrand?

09:28.176 --> 09:31.135
Yes, and I can get you
an unbelievable deal.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.660
Bless your hearts.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.662
You two are more transparent
than Savannah's implants.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.446
I did not get to my perch...

09:37.489 --> 09:39.579
...in Atlanta society
without my spies.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.190
I know you want the Swan House.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.018
Well, I'll cut
right to the chase.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.629
What will it take to get you
to switch venues?

09:46.673 --> 09:47.935
Sweet little Fallon.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.459
What is it?
Your third wedding?

09:50.502 --> 09:53.505
Isn't it all
an old hat by now?

09:53.549 --> 09:55.420
Says the woman on her sixth.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.597
FALLON: You can play
hardball all you want,

09:57.640 --> 10:00.512
but just know you will lose.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.036
I'm Fallon Carrington.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.559
I run this town,

10:03.603 --> 10:04.865
I make the rules

10:04.908 --> 10:07.737
and I always win,
sometimes gracefully.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.784
Your daughter is quite
an adversary.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.438
A real instinct for the jugular.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.049
You should have warned me.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.659
She's a modern woman.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.922
She knows what she wants
and how to get it.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.621
Well, finish your
tiny sandwiches, Mimi.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.320
This bitch has moves to make.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.804
Soon, I'll be enjoying
the wedding of the decade

10:30.847 --> 10:33.633
in a venue of a lifetime.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.592
I've missed your feistiness,
old friend. Sit back down.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.116
We have so much to discuss.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.121
ANDERS:
Ms. Jennings,

10:44.165 --> 10:45.949
sorry for the intrusion.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.951
But now that you're
Blake's fiancÃ©e,

10:47.995 --> 10:50.345
I thought we should get to know
each other so that I can

10:50.388 --> 10:52.434
tailor the manor
to your wants and needs.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.654
I'm not really a fussy person.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.220
Just standard protocol.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.222
Where are you from originally?

10:58.266 --> 10:59.789
And how is that related
to the manor?

10:59.833 --> 11:02.357
Oh, just so Mrs. Gunnerson
can prepare meals

11:02.400 --> 11:03.837
from your home region.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.491
Hmm. I'm happy
with her menus now.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.884
And what about
your family?

11:07.928 --> 11:09.625
So that we can add them
to the-the house contacts.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.323
Uh-huh.
We don't need to do that.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.064
What about your close friends?

11:14.108 --> 11:16.501
You can put down the names
of some of my coworkers

11:16.545 --> 11:17.894
from the PT clinic.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.114
Well, speaking of
employment history,

11:20.157 --> 11:21.419
where did you work prior?

11:21.463 --> 11:23.378
Just in case you have
any special interests.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.119
We can provide items
and activities to suit.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.555
Hmm.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.862
The only thing I need right now
is getting this TV

11:28.905 --> 11:31.473
on the mirror to work
so I can watch

11:31.516 --> 11:33.867
Club Azteca play their match
in La Liga Mexicana de FÃºtbol.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.912
Of course.

11:40.395 --> 11:41.526
Gracias.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.920
FALLON:
I understand

11:43.964 --> 11:45.530
that the president
of the historical society

11:45.574 --> 11:46.836
is a busy man.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.099
I need you to tell him
that Fallon Carrington,

11:49.143 --> 11:51.711
a busy woman, has an
urgent offer to present.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.321
I heard a frightening rumor

11:53.364 --> 11:55.149
that you had tea with Alexis.
You'll make up

11:55.192 --> 11:57.107
with the devil, but
you won't give Cristal a chance?

11:57.151 --> 11:59.109
I try to limit myself
to one good deed a day.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.764
Look, I'm just asking
you to include her

12:01.808 --> 12:03.505
in your plans, for me.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.507
I will consider it if you agree

12:05.550 --> 12:07.683
to shorten your wedding speech.Oh.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.076
My speech is five minutes.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.773
I'm willing
to trim it down to...

12:10.817 --> 12:12.470
four minutes.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.689
Mm...

12:13.733 --> 12:15.517
Two minutes.Okay, let's jump ahead

12:15.560 --> 12:16.823
to no minutes.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.042
No Blake Time gets you
Fallon and Cristal Time.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.524
Please stop crying.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.178
Daddy's trying
to reach other Daddy.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.788
Hey, this is Steven Carrington.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.181
Please leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.400
Voicemail again?
Steven, you're killing me.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.796
Shh.He's still going at it, huh?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.624
Yeah.
You know what,

12:35.667 --> 12:36.756
let me try something.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.715
Uh, not that I don't
appreciate the view,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.325
but why are you stripping
around my child?

12:41.369 --> 12:42.674
May I?

12:42.718 --> 12:44.459
Yeah.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.634
Come here.

12:48.332 --> 12:51.031
So, skin-on-skin contact's
the closest a baby can come

12:51.074 --> 12:52.467
to being back in the womb.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.338
It relaxes them.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.687
Come here,
little guy.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.646
You really have a way with him.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.256
Honestly,
this little guy's easy.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.040
Yeah.

13:03.652 --> 13:06.002
Um, Manuel, I've
been looking for you.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.438
Would you mind
taking a look

13:07.482 --> 13:08.657
at my tattoo?

13:08.700 --> 13:09.832
See how it's healing?

13:09.876 --> 13:10.702
Yeah. Sure.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.840
Looking good, huh?

13:17.884 --> 13:20.364
It's perfect.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.149
Okay, well, I should probably
take care of this little guy.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.325
Yeah.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.196
Don't be a stranger.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.809
Look,

13:29.852 --> 13:31.898
stamped tramp,

13:31.941 --> 13:34.378
Manuel is here
to take care of the baby,

13:34.422 --> 13:36.990
not the fire in your skirt.Okay,

13:37.033 --> 13:38.252
well, ever since Steven left,

13:38.295 --> 13:40.123
you've been sex-starved
and cranky.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.995
I think you're the one
that needs to go have a long,

13:42.038 --> 13:43.779
cold shower.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.395
Wonderful news.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.920
I am this close
to breaking Mimi.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.400
So you don't have
to do a thing.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.880
Mama's got you.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.883
Actually, I have been trading
calls with the president

14:00.927 --> 14:02.885
of the historical society.
He owns the Swan House,

14:02.929 --> 14:05.148
and once I make him an offer,
he won't be able to resist.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.149
Wait a minute.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.543
You're going to buy the estate?

14:08.586 --> 14:10.284
Well, once I own it, I can do
whatever I want with it,

14:10.327 --> 14:12.677
including ousting
that monogram-loving,

14:12.721 --> 14:14.201
Lilly Pulitzer-wearing
dye job.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.898
But I'm so close.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.945
Why don't you let your mother do
this one thing for you, Fallon?

14:18.988 --> 14:21.773
After all I've missed,
I...

14:21.817 --> 14:25.168
...well, it would just mean the
world to me if you'd let me play

14:25.212 --> 14:28.519
a small part in the most
important day of your life.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.872
Fine.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.525
You haven't ruined anything yet.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.919
And since you're taking care of
the second most important part

14:36.963 --> 14:38.573
of my wedding,

14:38.616 --> 14:41.750
why don't you come help me
with the first?

14:43.534 --> 14:45.493
Wedding dress shopping.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.669
You know,

14:47.712 --> 14:49.845
I am thrilled
to be sharing

14:49.889 --> 14:52.674
this mother-daughter
bonding moment.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.241
I don't know if
I ever told you,

14:54.284 --> 14:56.939
but when I was
getting married, I...

14:56.983 --> 14:59.855
Well, my mother was
the most militant bitch

14:59.899 --> 15:00.943
about my bridal gown.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.510
You won't be
militant, will you?

15:02.553 --> 15:03.641
Fallon.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.383
Thank you for inviting me.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.170
What in the hell
is she doing here?

15:10.213 --> 15:12.172
I had to strike
a little deal with Dad.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.043
I mean, you know
how difficult family can be.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.959
How awful that Blake
would impose her upon us.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.788
Well, you don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.616
I wouldn't dream of missing

15:21.659 --> 15:23.792
the greatest decision
of my daughter's life.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.534
Well, I'm not sure
I would say that, but okay.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.492
The ground rules are as follows:

15:28.536 --> 15:30.973
your opinion is not
as important as mine,

15:31.017 --> 15:32.322
I look amazing in wedding gowns,

15:32.366 --> 15:34.411
and if you take any photos,
I get approvals.

15:34.455 --> 15:37.501
Now, help me say yes
to a dress.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.416
And let's go hard
on the bubbles.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.867
Ooh.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.260
You look like

15:57.304 --> 15:59.219
an absolutely divine

15:59.262 --> 16:00.002
toilet brush.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.615
2001: A Slut Odyssey.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.750
Big Bird dipped
in bleach.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.143
Still seeing
toilet brush.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.188
Under a mosquito net.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.020
That is gorgeous.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.980
Just not on you.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.199
Then maybe-- I don't know,

16:23.243 --> 16:24.200
maybe I'm not dressable.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.072
I can't think of anything worse.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.682
Fallon, you're stunning.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.249
Don't worry about it.

16:29.292 --> 16:32.295
Sometimes you have to try on,
like, 50 different gowns

16:32.339 --> 16:33.644
to find the right one.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.298
Personally, I love this one.

16:35.342 --> 16:36.691
:
Well, if you love it so much,

16:36.734 --> 16:38.867
why don't you wear it

16:38.910 --> 16:40.086
Why not?

16:40.129 --> 16:41.783
Wedding bells
are ringing for you, too.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.483
There you are.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.703
How dare she hijack your moment?

16:48.746 --> 16:51.923
I'm the mother of the bride,
and if she can try on dresses,

16:51.967 --> 16:53.882
I should be allowed to as well.

16:53.925 --> 16:56.406
But these are all wedding gowns.
They're white.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.842
It's trendy for the bridal party

16:57.886 --> 16:59.235
to wear the same color
as the bride.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.107
Look at Pippa Middleton.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.283
Ooh. I should invite her.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.936
WOMAN:
Excuse me, ma'am.Oh, Mom.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.808
You should wear that.

17:06.851 --> 17:10.203
A live telegram
for Alexis Carrington.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.987
Ooh, I love these.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.076
I'll pay you $1 million
not to sing.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.339
Hear ye, hear ye.

17:16.383 --> 17:19.690
The historic Peachtree
Preservation Society welcomes

17:19.734 --> 17:22.867
Ms. Alexis Morell
Carrington as member

17:22.911 --> 17:24.304
and hereby
nominate her

17:24.347 --> 17:27.307
to the committee of the
annual Peachtree Jubilee.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.831
Signed, Mimi Rose
Prescott, President.

17:29.874 --> 17:32.051
Mimi Rose Prescott?

17:32.094 --> 17:34.792
Why would she want--Well, this is a surprise.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.882
Mimi must know that I'm back
in the Carrington fold and...

17:37.926 --> 17:40.015
about to make a splash
reentering the social scene.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.714
Clearly, she's trying
to cull my favor.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.455
Is it clear?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.283
Well, I'm flattered, of course.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.721
But that does not mean
that I'll waver from my quest

17:50.765 --> 17:52.767
to get you your dream venue.

17:52.810 --> 17:53.985
Hmm.Always

17:54.029 --> 17:55.813
and forever Team Fallon.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.815
Now, I need
a dress.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.146
Baby.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.061
Hey, my little baby.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.062
What's wrong?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.194
Hey.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.153
My wedding album
was finally delivered.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.590
Um, it's silly,
but I was hoping I'd...

18:33.634 --> 18:35.331
look it over for the first time
with my husband.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.854
Oh, come on.
That's not silly.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.552
It's sweet.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.468
We haven't been able
to chat much.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.773
He's in South America,

18:42.817 --> 18:45.124
doing good for the world
or whatever,

18:45.167 --> 18:46.864
but I just wanted
to hear his voice.

18:46.908 --> 18:50.085
You want to hear if he misses
you as much as you miss him.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.566
And now everything's
happening without him.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.916
The album, the baby,

18:54.959 --> 18:59.007
just passing through the
Steven-shaped hole in my life.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.879
I know what that emptiness
feels like, Sam.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.186
My baby brother passed away
when I was just a kid.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.710
It's been over 20 years,
but, uh,

19:06.754 --> 19:08.843
I miss him every day.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.063
I'm so sorry.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.283
Yeah.

19:15.850 --> 19:16.807
Okay.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.200
Enough sad stuff.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.115
Mopey isn't really
a good look for me.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.508
At least you got
this little guy.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.466
Babies make everything better.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.468
I just hope he turns out
to be a daddy's boy.

19:25.512 --> 19:29.385
So we can be
disgustingly inseparable.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.781
MICHAEL:
So, what's Ada's deal?

19:33.824 --> 19:35.130
Only thing
I know about her

19:35.174 --> 19:37.132
is she had ties
with Max Van Kirk.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.917
She helped Van Kirk Industries
with imports, exports,

19:39.961 --> 19:42.093
that sort of thing,

19:42.137 --> 19:45.662
until she went to Max and asked
for a bigger piece of the pie.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.055
He said no.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.492
So she went out on her own,
took the whole damn pie.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.277
Ballsy.Stupid.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.626
You see,
the Van Kirks might look

19:52.669 --> 19:53.975
all Park Avenue on the outside,

19:54.018 --> 19:56.238
but, on the inside,
they're absolute savages.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.848
See, Max,
he couldn't stand being hustled.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.938
So he got someone
to try to take Ada out.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.940
When everything went sideways,

20:02.984 --> 20:05.987
her six-year-old daughter
got caught in the crossfire

20:06.030 --> 20:06.988
and died.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.990
Yeah, I know.
It blows.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.166
But I wouldn't feel
too sorry for her,

20:11.210 --> 20:15.910
'cause she was evil
long before that ever went down.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.005
Oh. Here you go, Officer.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.925
Paperwork's incomplete.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.493
I'm gonna need to inspect
the contents of your vehicle.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.059
Paperwork's supposed
to let us pass right through.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.713
We've done this a million times.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.803
U.S. Customs has the authority
to conduct random inspections.

20:39.847 --> 20:42.371
I'm gonna need you
to step out of your vehicle,

20:42.415 --> 20:44.678
open up the back of your truck.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.941
Maybe we should just call Ada
and get her to straighten out

20:46.984 --> 20:48.986
whatever paperwork she needs
for these antiques.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.945
Too late for that.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.903
Those things aren't
exactly obtained legally.

20:52.947 --> 20:56.559
If they look too close, our
asses are gonna wind up in jail.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.518
Unless Ada gets to us first.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.175
You know,
maybe I should make a cut-out.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.090
I've been working so hard
on my obliques,

21:06.134 --> 21:08.136
it's a sin to hide them.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.055
Add it to the account.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.362
So, while you were stuffing
yourself into that dress,

21:16.405 --> 21:19.930
I was thinking, I should just
buy the Swan House after all.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.933
Why? But I thought we agreed

21:22.977 --> 21:25.849
I should take some time
and gently mold Mimi.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.721
But there is no time
to be gentle,

21:27.764 --> 21:30.027
and there is no reason
to care what Mimi thinks.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.681
Well, just let me talk to her
one more time.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.117
Okay, great. Call her right now.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.945
Well, I'm not gonna ambush her
with a call.

21:34.989 --> 21:38.122
I mean, she is the
gatekeeper of society.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.254
Look, I'll e-mail her later,

21:39.298 --> 21:41.387
and I'll set up
a definite time to chat.

21:41.430 --> 21:44.041
Perfect. See, now,
that really eases my mind.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.956
For second there
I was starting to spin out,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.350
thinking that you were trying
to join forces with Mimi

21:48.394 --> 21:49.786
to get back into society.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.092
That is absurd.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.963
Is it? Because earlier today,

21:53.007 --> 21:55.792
you were trying to convince me
not to buy the Swan House.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.098
And suddenly you're a member

21:57.141 --> 21:59.535
of the most exclusive
social society in Atlanta

21:59.579 --> 22:01.102
that Mimi happens to be
the president of.

22:01.145 --> 22:03.365
But I'm just spinning out,
right?

22:03.409 --> 22:05.149
More like Alexis
spinning her web.

22:05.193 --> 22:06.803
Stay out of this, she-devil.

22:06.847 --> 22:09.502
Look, that would
be crazy, Fallon.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.112
So crazy.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.897
Because we're Carringtons.
We aresociety.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.246
We don't need those harpies.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.640
Oh, but wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.207
You're not a Carrington.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.992
Not like me,
and not like Cristal.

22:22.036 --> 22:24.343
I will be very soon.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.432
Yes, you will. Welcome
to the family, by the way.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.347
Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.609
You know, I cannot wait

22:29.652 --> 22:31.611
to have another maternal figure
around here.

22:31.654 --> 22:34.004
Fallon.

22:34.048 --> 22:37.965
Think of all the fun stepmom
and stepdaughter spa trips,

22:38.008 --> 22:40.097
shopping sprees...I warned you

22:40.141 --> 22:41.229
about my children!

22:42.273 --> 22:44.232
Don't you ever,

22:44.275 --> 22:45.929
evertouch my hair.

22:45.973 --> 22:48.062
Get her off me!

22:48.105 --> 22:49.846
Fallon, why aren't
you helping me? Ow!

22:49.890 --> 22:51.021
Oh, I don't know.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.067
Maybe because you manipulated me

22:53.110 --> 22:54.851
into giving up my
epic venue in exchange

22:54.895 --> 22:58.072
for a membership to Mimi's
society of peach douche-lettes!

22:58.115 --> 22:59.552
No! Aah!

23:02.032 --> 23:05.209
And what's worse,
you won't admit it.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.472
Fine, I...

23:06.515 --> 23:08.604
I did it because I didn't think
it would matter.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.737
I mean, you can get married
anywhere and be happy.

23:10.780 --> 23:13.261
I have nothing. It was my...

23:13.304 --> 23:15.698
well, my one chance

23:15.742 --> 23:19.136
to get my old life back.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.182
The one time I ask you
for help to make up

23:21.225 --> 23:22.662
for all of the moments
we have missed,

23:22.705 --> 23:24.011
you sold me out

23:24.054 --> 23:26.056
for a step up
on the social ladder.

23:28.102 --> 23:31.148
It's gonna be the society
wedding of the season.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.455
It's a shame
you're no longer invited.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.241
Enjoy the fruits of your labor.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.680
Before they rot.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.950
Man, what are we gonna do?
We can't let him check

23:49.993 --> 23:51.647
those crates.Guys. I got a line of
trucks waiting to get in.

23:51.691 --> 23:55.042
Need you to open
it up. Let's go.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.304
I got this.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.045
What the hell are you doing

23:58.088 --> 24:00.787
Just get ready to drive
like your life depends on it.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.311
'Cause it might.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.926
Let's open these boxes.
Let's go.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.188
I will open these boxes.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.147
Every last one of them.What are you doing?

24:13.190 --> 24:15.149
I saw the way you looked at me,
Officer Rogers.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.151
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:17.194 --> 24:19.283
I watched you wave
three vehicles through,

24:19.327 --> 24:21.982
no problem,
but myvan needs a search?

24:22.025 --> 24:23.244
Unbelievable.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you saying?

24:24.767 --> 24:26.552
It has nothing to do with that.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.205
It's your paperwork.

24:28.249 --> 24:29.424
You don't have
to explain it to me.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.948
You can explain it
to my lawyers, the ACLU,

24:31.992 --> 24:33.994
the news media, your
friends, your family.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.083
Will you please help me
open these damn boxes?

24:36.126 --> 24:37.171
I got calls to make.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.173
You are gonna
find yourself famous

24:39.216 --> 24:41.218
for all the wrong
reasons, Officer.
Wait.

24:41.262 --> 24:44.395
Hold on.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.140
Think you gentlemen
are good here.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.012
Just move it along.

24:52.055 --> 24:55.276
Dude, that was...
kind of screwed up.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.931
Maybe I was just playing
the cards that life dealt me.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.367
It's a hell of a lot better

24:59.410 --> 25:01.238
than the hand
you were about to throw down.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.857
Hey.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.336
Hey.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.948
Everything okay with the baby?The baby, yeah.

25:14.991 --> 25:17.820
Me... eh.

25:17.864 --> 25:20.344
Oh, you still haven't connected
with Steven, huh?

25:20.388 --> 25:21.955
Nope.

25:21.998 --> 25:25.698
But I'm glad someone is
enjoying themselves around here.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.613
I just wish there was
some way I could think of

25:27.656 --> 25:29.049
to cheer you up, you know?

25:29.092 --> 25:31.138
You're sweet.

25:31.181 --> 25:32.487
Not always.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.187
I'd love to show you
that side of me.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.498
FALLON:
That's not a counteroffer.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.673
That's an insult.

25:44.717 --> 25:47.937
Look, I hate
to use the "C" word,

25:47.981 --> 25:50.200
but I am a Carrington,

25:50.244 --> 25:53.073
and, uh, I will buy you
your own private island.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.815
You can build 50 replicas
of that same house,

25:55.858 --> 25:59.079
maybe even make one
just for swans.

25:59.122 --> 26:02.082
I'm sorry,
are you laughing at my proposal?

26:06.652 --> 26:08.610
Oh, no. Sorry.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.265
That croissant
did nothing to you.

26:11.308 --> 26:14.442
Well, I will make it up to that
croissant by not eating it.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.357
No luck
with that venue you wanted?

26:16.400 --> 26:19.665
It just guts me
that I can't have it.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.232
Keep thinking about my grandma
getting married there

26:22.276 --> 26:24.321
and Michael and I standing
in the same spot.

26:24.365 --> 26:25.975
There's only one
thing that matters

26:26.019 --> 26:27.586
when you're getting married.Yes.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.631
A photographer with soft lenses.
Already booked.

26:29.675 --> 26:30.893
If you deeply,

26:30.937 --> 26:33.330
fully love the person
you're marrying

26:33.374 --> 26:36.464
and you're surrounded by love
and support,

26:36.507 --> 26:38.466
it doesn't matter
where you get married.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.250
It could be in a barn.

26:40.294 --> 26:43.427
Mm, you had me up until barn.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.429
It's not the place, Fallon.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.083
It's the people that matter.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.911
Fine.

26:48.955 --> 26:51.697
Fine. I guess I have been
a bit of a bridezilla

26:51.740 --> 26:54.525
about this whole thing.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.963
You know, I can see
why my dad likes you.

26:57.006 --> 26:59.487
Aside from your
annoyingly perfect hair.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.056
What's with the 50 texts?

27:03.099 --> 27:05.188
You won't believe what
happened last night.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.452
Manuel came on to me.

27:08.496 --> 27:11.978
And I know it's insane,
but it happened,

27:12.021 --> 27:15.982
and now my body is spinning,
and I don't know what to do.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.244
First of all,

27:17.287 --> 27:18.593
you need to calm yourself.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.421
And second, he's clearly
playing for both teams,

27:20.464 --> 27:21.770
'cause he was about
to come on to me

27:21.814 --> 27:23.511
before you shut
his fine ass down.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.295
Can you please not be jealous
right now?

27:25.339 --> 27:27.994
We need to focus on myneeds.How do you even know

27:28.037 --> 27:30.344
he was hitting on you?
You're old and married.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.912
First of all, rude.

27:32.955 --> 27:36.132
It's just that he used
the same night swimming move

27:36.176 --> 27:37.481
that I used on Steven,

27:37.525 --> 27:40.615
and it was just as hot
as when I did it.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.399
You need to behave yourself,

27:42.443 --> 27:44.837
and I'm not saying that
because I want him.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.839
I don't think.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.627
Here.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.847
You need to look through
your wedding album

27:54.890 --> 27:56.805
and remind yourself
who your heart belongs to.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.851
Keep it zipped.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.289
Mimi.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.508
Is that you?

28:04.552 --> 28:06.336
Are we so similar that we shop
at the same place,

28:06.380 --> 28:08.034
same time

28:08.077 --> 28:10.689
I'm not happy, Alexis.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.560
No, I'm not happy, either.

28:12.603 --> 28:13.822
Your daughter is still trying

28:13.866 --> 28:15.432
to buy the Swan House.

28:15.476 --> 28:18.000
Believe me, I feel your pain.

28:18.044 --> 28:21.221
Just be grateful that
that irascible Fallon

28:21.264 --> 28:22.570
isn't your child.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.833
I am incapable
of raising a hellcat like that.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.139
Now...

28:26.182 --> 28:29.708
you did assure me
that you would handle her.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.492
I just came up
with the perfect solution.

28:31.535 --> 28:33.668
Did you, now?Why don't you

28:33.712 --> 28:35.191
change your wedding
to another day?

28:35.235 --> 28:36.671
And I will pay for it.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.151
:
What?

28:38.194 --> 28:40.544
That way my daughter
gets her dream venue,

28:40.588 --> 28:41.720
you get a free wedding,

28:41.763 --> 28:43.591
I get into
the Peachtree Society,

28:43.634 --> 28:46.115
and everyone's a winner.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.814
Hmm. Let me pray on that.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.380
No!

28:50.424 --> 28:52.382
As long as I am standing,

28:52.426 --> 28:55.777
I am getting married on that day
at my venue as planned.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.387
So call your daughter off

28:57.431 --> 29:00.739
or kiss the Peachtree
Preservation Society good-bye.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.784
Bye-bye.

29:02.828 --> 29:06.701
I'm on it. Love those shoes.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.805
Pray on that, bitch.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.633
Ma'am, are you all right

29:30.464 --> 29:33.815
ALEXIS: Oh, my God! Mimi!
Somebody call an ambulance!

29:38.907 --> 29:40.430
[announcer speaking Spanish
on TV]

29:44.391 --> 29:49.178
Are you okay?

29:49.222 --> 29:51.137
I'd be better
if the refs weren't blind

29:51.180 --> 29:53.226
or being paid
by Los Reyes Rojos.

29:53.269 --> 29:56.795
So, uh, I was thinking about
buying Fallon a dream car

29:56.838 --> 29:58.187
for a wedding present,
you know, for her.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.885
Any car, any color, any year.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.191
How about jewelry

30:02.235 --> 30:03.366
What do you think?

30:03.410 --> 30:04.367
You're pathetic, Blake.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.847
I know what you're doing.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.980
You're worse than Anders,
which is not easy.

30:08.023 --> 30:11.200
I... have no clue what
you're talking about.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.116
You're the sweetest man
in the world

30:14.160 --> 30:15.857
for wanting to buy me
an engagement gift.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.512
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.428
How about a Rolls
Convertible.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.125
Your hair would look amazing
blowing in the wind.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.648
Uh-uh.No wind.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.520
Fine. Okay, the hardtop. Or
the convertible and a hat.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.001
I want nothing material,
mi amor.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.917
I want quality time with you.
Enjoying each other's company,

30:31.960 --> 30:36.747
watching soccer, just like I did
with my family growing up.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.280
I just, um...

30:47.323 --> 30:49.282
um, I...

30:49.325 --> 30:51.284
Hi.

30:51.327 --> 30:53.286
You want to come in?Yeah.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.380
Glad you came by.

31:00.423 --> 31:03.557
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you, Sam.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.429
Like, as your employer, or...?

31:07.953 --> 31:10.433
I think you've been thinking
about me, too.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.435
Haven't you?

31:12.479 --> 31:14.916
With and without pants.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.570
Wow.

31:16.613 --> 31:17.788
Was that out loud

31:17.832 --> 31:20.182
What, you mean...

31:20.226 --> 31:22.228
like this?

31:24.360 --> 31:27.015
What is happening?

31:41.421 --> 31:43.510
Uh...

31:43.553 --> 31:45.077
I can't do this.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.687
I'm sorry.Why not?

31:46.730 --> 31:48.341
It's what we both want.

31:48.384 --> 31:49.429
It's not right.

31:49.472 --> 31:50.952
I can't do this

31:50.996 --> 31:52.432
to Steven-- I love him.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.390
In fact, I don't
think we can be

31:54.434 --> 31:56.088
under the same roof, Manny.
I'm sorry.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.698
Sam, you... you don't have...

31:57.741 --> 31:59.308
I have to let you go.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.876
I'm sorry
if I pushed too far, Sam.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.449
MICHAEL:
Ada?

32:09.492 --> 32:10.493
Where the hell are you?

32:10.537 --> 32:11.973
Man, will you chill?

32:12.017 --> 32:13.366
It all worked out.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.281
We did what we
needed to do.

32:15.324 --> 32:16.630
Congratulations, gentlemen.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.327
That was one of our
most lucrative shipments.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.416
Yeah. Things got
a little intense,

32:20.460 --> 32:22.244
but we pulled it off.Yes, there was

32:22.288 --> 32:24.377
a little miscommunication
with the paperwork,
but you improvised.

32:24.420 --> 32:25.987
KEITH:
A little...

32:26.031 --> 32:27.293
miscommunication?

32:27.336 --> 32:28.685
Your screwup could
have gotten us

32:28.729 --> 32:30.078
thrown in jail, or killed.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.993
You done throwing
your little tantrum, Mr. Hayes?

32:32.037 --> 32:35.779
I strongly suggest you
reassess your status here.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.564
You are a replaceable meathead,

32:37.607 --> 32:39.479
especially with Mr. Culhane
stepping up so nicely.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.263
And before you do
anything stupid,

32:41.307 --> 32:43.004
which is entirely
in your wheelhouse,

32:43.048 --> 32:44.179
ask yourself,

32:44.223 --> 32:46.442
how'd it go the last time
you crossed me?

32:46.486 --> 32:47.748
Oh, that's right.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.141
You wound up in prison.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.664
I'm sure that
could be arranged again.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.579
I don't think so.

32:53.536 --> 32:54.624
K-Keith...

32:54.668 --> 32:55.712
what are you doing?Doing something

32:55.756 --> 32:56.844
I should've done
a long time ago.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.280
I'm taking over.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.021
Put the gun down before
somebody gets shot. Please.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.544
I'd listen to him, Mr. Hayes.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.720
He is
the intelligent one here.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.200
Shut up.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.855
She's playing you, Michael,
just like she once played me.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.509
But we don't need
her anymore.

33:09.552 --> 33:10.945
This is our way out.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.860
ADA: Listen to
a rational voice, Michael.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.514
We can run our operation
much smoother

33:14.557 --> 33:16.472
without this loose cannon,
you know that.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.737
I've had enough, Ada.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.828
I'm sick of you
manipulating me like a puppet.

33:24.872 --> 33:28.049
KEITH:
My man! Tie this shrew up,
get her out of here.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.068
Baby? Right here.

33:47.112 --> 33:50.245
Daddy 1 and Daddy 2

33:50.289 --> 33:52.552
are gonna have
wedding album time.

33:52.595 --> 33:56.251
Okay? So no crying
and no spitting up.

33:56.295 --> 33:57.252
Okay?

34:08.872 --> 34:12.485
Well, that's a brutal reward
for notgiving in to temptation.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.925
I think I'm just gonna crack
open the album without Steven.

34:17.968 --> 34:21.320
I need a reminder
of why I love this man so much.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.933
You are such a good
listener, Little Blake.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.462
Hello there.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.986
What happened to you?

34:36.030 --> 34:37.162
Don't ask.

34:37.205 --> 34:38.337
My little angel.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.860
Oh!

34:39.903 --> 34:41.209
Oh,

34:41.253 --> 34:42.645
the trauma.

34:42.689 --> 34:44.212
Whatcha looking at?

34:44.256 --> 34:46.301
Wedding album.

34:46.345 --> 34:47.694
Aw.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.135
SAM:
What the hell

34:54.179 --> 34:55.397
SAM:
Trouble.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.138
She was Matthew's wife,

34:57.182 --> 34:59.923
the man my aunt had
an affair with.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.230
You invited her
to the wedding?

35:02.274 --> 35:05.451
That's a social faux pas
and a truly stupid move.

35:05.494 --> 35:09.237
No, I didn't invite her.
She's violent and crazy-pants.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.674
But I thought she was
supposed to be locked up

35:11.718 --> 35:14.677
in a mental health
institution.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.897
I'm gonna call them

35:16.940 --> 35:20.944
and figure out how the hell
Claudia was at my wedding.

35:22.642 --> 35:24.861
Claudia.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.478
Oh, my God.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.395
Hank, you idiot!

35:36.438 --> 35:38.527
Did you forget
how to pick up the phone?

35:38.571 --> 35:40.834
Where did you take Matthew?
Where is my son?

35:40.877 --> 35:42.488
Don't worry, baby.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.664
Mommy's coming to find you.

35:56.850 --> 35:57.981
I need you

35:58.025 --> 35:58.982
to close your eyes.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.985
Mmm. I like where this is going.

36:02.029 --> 36:05.293
Please don't tie me
up, Mr. Intruder.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.338
Oh.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.168
Just close your eyes.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.693
:
Okay.

36:13.736 --> 36:16.086
Now, I know you didn't want
an engagement gift,

36:16.130 --> 36:18.001
but I got you
something simple...

36:18.045 --> 36:19.525
and meaningful...

36:19.568 --> 36:21.179
that I think
you'll appreciate.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.050
Blake.Open.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.053
Okay,

36:26.096 --> 36:28.011
I don't recognize
the colors,

36:28.055 --> 36:29.839
but I'm sure it's
for a great team,

36:29.883 --> 36:32.581
and I'll happily
wear it. Thank you.They willbe a great team.

36:32.625 --> 36:36.194
It's the new National Soccer
Federation expansion team

36:36.237 --> 36:39.371
in Atlanta,
and I just purchased it.

36:39.414 --> 36:40.894
You bought a soccer team?

36:40.937 --> 36:45.768
I may have paid $10 or...
$40 million too much for it.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.248
I meant what I said.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.337
I didn't want anything
material from you.

36:49.381 --> 36:52.035
You said all you cared about
was quality time together

36:52.079 --> 36:55.604
and soccer, and I'm giving it
to you the Blake Carrington way.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.911
We're gonna run this team
together, Cristal.

36:57.954 --> 37:00.043
It's our family's team.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.447
FALLON:
I just heard

37:12.491 --> 37:14.144
the most
interesting news

37:14.188 --> 37:16.059
about Mimi getting hit by a car.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.148
And I'm guessing, from
that fashion statement
around your neck,

37:18.192 --> 37:19.280
that you were the car.

37:19.324 --> 37:22.892
Oh... it was
truly horrifying.

37:22.936 --> 37:25.808
:
Poor Mimi and I

37:25.852 --> 37:27.636
are both victims here.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.203
What a coincidence...

37:29.247 --> 37:31.597
that the accident forced her
to delay her wedding date,

37:31.640 --> 37:33.947
and now the Swan House
is conveniently available.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.601
Oh, well, that's
Mimi for you.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.864
Even she couldn't pull off
walking down the aisle

37:37.907 --> 37:40.475
in heels and crutches.
And knowing that,

37:40.519 --> 37:42.042
you ran her over.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.305
: You
are unbelievable.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.829
I mean, how dark is your soul
that you could conjure up

37:46.873 --> 37:48.178
and carry out
something so twisted?

37:48.222 --> 37:50.790
Any selfless mother
would have done the same.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.532
I just want you to have
the perfect day, Fallon,

37:53.575 --> 37:55.621
even if I'm not invited.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.058
You're insane.

37:58.101 --> 38:00.626
And I love you,
even though you're insane.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.150
:
And with that...

38:03.193 --> 38:06.022
I would like to re-extend
the invitation to my wedding,

38:06.066 --> 38:07.981
if your neck heals in time.

38:08.024 --> 38:11.289
Oh, it would be my
great honor to attend.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.855
Though you should know

38:12.899 --> 38:15.423
I've decided notto get married
in that old birdhouse.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.077
I'm gonna get married here,

38:17.120 --> 38:18.165
at the Manor.What?

38:18.208 --> 38:19.819
When my dream venue
seemed impossible,

38:19.862 --> 38:21.299
it got me thinking.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.953
I mean, what's more special
and more personal than home?

38:23.997 --> 38:26.216
Grandma, Grandpa,
our entire family,

38:26.260 --> 38:29.089
we all shared our most
important memories right here.

38:29.132 --> 38:32.005
Fallon, I did this
at great personal sacrifice.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.094
And Mimi has
banned me for life

38:34.137 --> 38:36.270
from the Peachtree
Preservation Society.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.968
I can't even go there
when it's open to the public.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.231
I greatly appreciate
your sacrifice.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.233
I know it's a first for you.

38:43.277 --> 38:46.585
But... a wise woman
once told me that if you

38:46.628 --> 38:49.762
deeply love the person you're
going to marry, which I do,

38:49.805 --> 38:52.199
and you're surrounded by family,
which I will be,

38:52.242 --> 38:54.897
then it doesn't matter
where you get married.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.986
You could even get married
in a barn.

38:57.030 --> 39:01.077
Well, not this barn, but...
you know what I mean.

39:03.515 --> 39:06.518
They say tequila's the only
alcohol that's a stimulant.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.128
It's a myth, of course,

39:08.171 --> 39:10.435
created by men
who have never been stimulated.

39:10.478 --> 39:11.827
Thank you.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.089
No. Thank you--

39:13.133 --> 39:15.135
for the way you handled
the Keith situation.

39:17.485 --> 39:18.921
Mm.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.886
Tell me something.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.063
Why didn't you
let him kill me?

39:30.106 --> 39:33.283
Is it because doing this
gets your engine running?

39:34.328 --> 39:36.417
You do like it,
don't you?

39:38.419 --> 39:41.988
Keith told me about
the Van Kirk situation...

39:42.031 --> 39:44.164
and about your daughter.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.299
You delivered for me, so...

39:49.343 --> 39:51.563
I'm going to give you
your reward.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.129
This is all the blackmail

39:53.173 --> 39:54.740
on Fallon and Jeff Colby.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.959
And as a bonus
for saving my life,

39:57.003 --> 39:58.439
a third of the shipping loot.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.006
$5 million cash.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.791
ButI'm gonna
offer you a choice.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.837
You can walk away
from me for good,

40:04.880 --> 40:05.925
or stay,

40:05.968 --> 40:09.015
be your own man,
make a lot more money,

40:09.058 --> 40:10.756
keep doing what
you're so good at.

40:12.279 --> 40:15.413
â™ª

40:25.597 --> 40:27.512
Oh, that could work.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.822
Whatever's gotten
into you, don't stop.

40:33.866 --> 40:34.997
:
No.

40:40.089 --> 40:42.004
â™ª Stars were falling

40:42.048 --> 40:45.007
â™ª I...

40:45.051 --> 40:46.922
BLAKE:
Cristal?

40:46.966 --> 40:48.881
Let's go to bed.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.926
ALEXIS:
Oh, thank you, but today's

40:50.970 --> 40:52.493
about my beautiful daughter.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.975
Oh, my special day will be
upon us soon.

40:56.018 --> 40:58.891
Uh, hello, Melania.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.849
SAM: I spoke to the private
mental institution

41:00.893 --> 41:02.068
where Claudia was kept.

41:02.111 --> 41:03.722
She escaped
right before the wedding,

41:03.765 --> 41:05.375
and she hasn't been seen since.

41:05.419 --> 41:08.030
Well, how is it that
nobody's alerted anyone?

41:08.074 --> 41:09.858
Well, I guess they wanted
to keep cashing

41:09.902 --> 41:11.077
those Carrington checks.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.687
Some people.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.429
But I can't stop wondering

41:15.473 --> 41:17.997
why she'd be
at our wedding, and...

41:18.040 --> 41:20.042
I have this terrifying
thought that maybe...

41:20.086 --> 41:22.871
she was there because
she wanted to kill us all.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.352
She held us all at gunpoint
last Thanksgiving.

41:25.395 --> 41:27.528
And maybe it wasn't Hank
who killed my aunt.

41:27.572 --> 41:28.921
Maybe it was crazy Claudia.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.488
She has more motives.

41:30.531 --> 41:33.229
Matthew, us locking her up
in that facility.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.841
So you're saying
that she's so crazy

41:35.884 --> 41:38.539
she could shoot...
any one of us on sight?

41:38.583 --> 41:40.802
And she's on the loose?

41:40.846 --> 41:42.891
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

41:42.935 --> 41:44.850
Uh, who has the baby?

41:44.893 --> 41:46.895
Oh, I just checked on
him a little while ago.

41:46.939 --> 41:48.941
He was sleeping
like a baby.

41:48.984 --> 41:50.899
That'swhere the
expression comes from.

41:50.943 --> 41:54.033
I just looked in your room,
and LB's not there.

41:54.076 --> 41:55.817
What?

41:56.949 --> 41:59.212
