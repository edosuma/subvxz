00:18.720 --> 00:20.560
[gunshots echoing]

00:20.640 --> 00:25.720
Pack your lederhosen, boys.
You're going to Norway.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.320
[in Norwegian] I know you're hiding
something, Johnny. I just know.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.640
They called me Frankie boy.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.080
We could've had things
so pretty and nice together.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.480
I think you're a little drunk now.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.040
[gunshot echoes]

00:43.120 --> 00:44.520
[in English]
I have a strong feeling

00:44.600 --> 00:46.800
that you two know
what happened to my friend.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.520
Come here, kid. Come on.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.000
- What was that loud bang?
- Must have been a firecracker.

00:54.080 --> 00:58.400
[Laila]  My theory is that you're the link
to the two Americans.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.320
[theme music playing]

01:37.280 --> 01:39.320
[marching band playing]

01:48.840 --> 01:51.320
We gotta move fast.
They got Jonas.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.640
- What? Who?
- The two Americans we've been chasing.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.640
Look what I found in the street.
They got him.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.280
[in Norwegian] But who are these people?
What do they want with us?

01:59.360 --> 02:02.080
[in English] The only question
that matters is, how do we find them?

02:02.160 --> 02:03.800
Now, just think.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.120
You know Olympia?

02:10.200 --> 02:11.760
[in English]
Julius' daughter?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.840
[in Norwegian]
I think she was on the grad party bus.

02:13.920 --> 02:17.160
Maybe she knows
where they met the Americans.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.520
[in English] Good thinkin'.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.400
[camera clicks]

02:27.360 --> 02:31.400
[in Norwegian] Hi. There you are.
Did you find Jonas?

02:31.480 --> 02:33.800
[in English] Yeah. He went to hang out
with some friends.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.320
[in Norwegian] Oh, who?

02:35.400 --> 02:38.800
[in English] Uh, the Linnea girl,
and some other pals.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.320
You know, went to the school
to play some games.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.960
But our distributor called
and we got to run.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.880
[in Norwegian]
Now? It's the National Day.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.800
[in English] I know, I know.
Really, it's terrible.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.120
[in Norwegian]
No. You can't leave now.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.640
[in English]
Be back later, okay?

02:51.720 --> 02:53.160
[in Norwegian]   It's the National Day.
You can't just leave.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.280
[Johnny] Okay.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.720
[Sigrid in Norwegian] Johnny had to do
some work. Dear me.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.320
This must be the worst
National Day of all time.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.480
How about coming along with me?

03:07.560 --> 03:10.160
I'm off to a party at Reidun's,
my boss at NAV.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.200
I'm not really sure.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.720
You don't have to worry
that it'll be like up at the cabin.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.720
No.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.040
I've gone over to fruit juice now.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.040
I wasn't thinking of that.
I just lost my energy.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.840
Come with me.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.040
Lots of exciting people
of all colors and shapes.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.720
Yes, maybe just a short visit.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.640
Yes, come.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.320
- It'll be great.
- I don't know Reidun.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.160
Yes, you do.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.520
[in English]
Why did you stop the car?

03:55.600 --> 03:58.240
[in Norwegian] You know
I back you up all the way, boss.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.760
[in English] Yeah.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.800
[in Norwegian] It's just that this time
I don't feel you're being honest with me.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.440
[in English] Maybe you should let me
take care of the big picture, huh?

04:15.840 --> 04:18.600
[in Norwegian] You're asking me
to go to war

04:18.680 --> 04:21.680
but won't even say who the enemy is.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.440
[in English]
Yeah, maybe you're right.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.480
You deserve the truth.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.840
You know about my past life
in New York City?

04:36.920 --> 04:41.120
[in Norwegian] Yes, when you started up
in the restaurant business?

04:41.200 --> 04:44.720
[in English]
Well, that's not the whole story.

04:44.800 --> 04:51.040
I also belonged to an organization
that's a little tough to get out of.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.560
Maybe you've heard of it.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.160
The CIA?

05:00.240 --> 05:01.600
Oh!

05:01.680 --> 05:06.200
Yeah, well, bad guys
from the past have, uh,

05:06.280 --> 05:08.800
caught up to me
and they're looking for me.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.920
I knew it! Of course.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.280
Now that we've gotten that off our chest,
let's go get the kid.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.080
You got it, Agent Henriksen.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.200
[clinking glass]

05:26.160 --> 05:28.840
[in Norwegian]
Yes...

05:28.920 --> 05:35.080
As most of you know, this has been
a tough year for the Backe family.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.120
I looked death right in the eye
for a few weeks.

05:38.200 --> 05:43.480
Fortunately I came through,
but I want to tell you something.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.440
I really wouldn't like to have missed
those weeks.

05:49.040 --> 05:53.160
It's when you realize how short a time
we have on this little marble of ours

05:53.240 --> 05:56.320
that you learn to cherish...

05:58.640 --> 06:00.640
what's important:

06:01.640 --> 06:03.160
family.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.960
In recognition of this, I have,

06:07.040 --> 06:10.600
together with the guys
in my barbershop sextet,

06:10.680 --> 06:14.960
prepared a little musical tribute
to my children.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.040
Not singing, Dad. Please.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.560
And since your sister
is in bed with the flu,

06:20.640 --> 06:23.440
you'll have to get up
and take it in alone.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.920
[blowing pitch pipe]

06:32.000 --> 06:34.240
[humming pitch pipe's note]

06:35.440 --> 06:37.880
[harmonizing simple melody]

06:47.480 --> 06:49.400
- [in English] Yeah!
- [clapping]

06:49.480 --> 06:52.720
Yeah, fantastic.
Terrific, huh?

06:52.800 --> 06:55.960
Can these guys sing
or can these guys sing, huh?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.800
Yeah!

06:59.320 --> 07:02.800
Excuse us, folks, we just got to borrow
the host for one minute, all right.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.360
Yeah!

07:06.440 --> 07:08.520
What the fuck is this?
I'm in the middle of a song here.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.720
Sorry, but we've got
to talk to your daughter.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.280
Why?

07:12.360 --> 07:15.040
She may have some information
about some guys we're looking for.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.920
[in Norwegian]
She's has the flu, up in her room,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.360
and I don't think it's right to barge in
on the National Day.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.320
[in English]
It's not appropriate.

07:22.400 --> 07:27.200
Not appropriate? Like telling your family
and friends you got cancer when you don't?

07:34.880 --> 07:37.440
[muffled pop music playing from room]

07:40.720 --> 07:45.240
[Torgeir in Norwegian] We're colleagues
of your father and have some questions.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.520
[Olympia] Go away! I'm sick!

07:48.800 --> 07:51.920
[in English] You want us to tell
your father how you got that flu?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Drinking illegal booze,
shit like that?

07:56.800 --> 07:59.160
[in Norwegian]
What is it you want?

07:59.240 --> 08:02.440
We're looking for those Americans
you were partying with yesterday.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.000
- Where did you meet them?
- I can't remember.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.160
[in English]
Try and focus, all right.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.760
[in Norwegian] I guess it was over
by Hunderfossen campsite.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.400
[in English]
I know where that is.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.680
[Jonas sniffling]

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
You okay, there?

08:32.040 --> 08:34.440
Here. It's clean. It's fine.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.720
Now, you don't have to worry,
we're not going to hurt you.

08:40.800 --> 08:44.000
We just need to get the attention
of your mom's boyfriend.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.400
- [door opens]
- Understand?

08:47.800 --> 08:49.160
What did Tagliano say?

08:49.240 --> 08:52.800
This fucking crappy phone.
I got no connection there.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.840
Let's use the pay phone
over by the shower area.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.560
[Jerry] Come on, kid. Let's go.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.480
Don't you try anything, yeah,
you sneaky little freak.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.720
- [in Norwegian] Hello!
- [Reidun] Yoo-hoo!

09:04.800 --> 09:07.280
Welcome! And happy National Day.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.720
- Hi.
- Hi. Congratulations.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.240
Is this where the party is?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.920
[festive folk music playing]

09:20.720 --> 09:22.040
Hi!

09:22.120 --> 09:25.360
Nice to see you here.
Have you been here long?

09:28.320 --> 09:30.360
- Hi. Hi
- Hi.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.480
Hello, didn't expect
to bump into you here.

09:38.560 --> 09:43.120
No, it's a bit of a new circle of friends,
you might say.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.560
[folk music playing]

09:48.120 --> 09:53.720
What about Jonas and Linnea? Apparently,
they were on their way to school together.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.720
Oh, really? I only just let Linnea off
there, but I didn't see Jonas.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.320
Didn't see Jonas?

10:04.560 --> 10:07.720
- Jan, I'm going to have to go.
- What, already?

10:07.800 --> 10:11.720
I'm sure it's nothing, but I have to check
everything's okay with Jonas.

10:11.800 --> 10:17.000
How is poor little me going to manage,
all alone at the party?

10:17.080 --> 10:19.480
I'd say it looks like
you're getting on all right.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.360
Well yes. It's always stimulating

10:21.440 --> 10:24.440
to share experiences
with younger colleagues.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.840
I'm gonna have to leave.
Talk to you later, okay?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.200
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.800
Well, have you seen
the mail everyone just got?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.280
No.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.240
Oh, my God!

10:40.800 --> 10:42.440
I've brought some food for us.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.840
[laughs]

10:43.920 --> 10:45.880
- Meatballs. No?
- No, thank you.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.440
[clattering]

11:00.200 --> 11:02.240
Sure it's this cabin?

11:08.760 --> 11:10.400
[in English]
Come on.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.240
Look how many cigarettes.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.800
Still burning.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.240
Holy shit!

11:22.440 --> 11:24.200
[phone ringing]

11:26.480 --> 11:29.200
- Yeah.
-  Okay, Frankie boy,

11:29.280 --> 11:32.840
- game is over and you lose.
- [folk music playing nearby]

11:32.920 --> 11:36.840
- Jerry Delucci.
- [folk music playing through phone]

11:36.920 --> 11:40.280
Aldo sent his googootz nephew
to take me out?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.560
Goddamn insult.

11:42.640 --> 11:47.320
Save it, sunshine. If you want the kid
to see his mother again,

11:47.400 --> 11:48.720
you'll do as you're told.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.600
Yeah, okay.
So how do you wanna play this?

11:52.680 --> 11:54.960
[folk music playing nearby
and through phone]

11:55.040 --> 11:57.840
You gotta speak up, Frankie. There's some
sort of echo thing going on here.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.400
[folk music playing nearby
and through phone]

12:02.640 --> 12:04.640
[quietly]
They're right here.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.280
What'd you say, Frankie?
Speak up, boy.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.360
Yo, Frank?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.360
Johnny!

12:20.440 --> 12:22.760
[Robert] Come on!
Go, go, go! Go! Go!

12:36.520 --> 12:38.200
[Johnny] Fuckers!

12:40.120 --> 12:42.320
[indistinct chattering]

12:49.360 --> 12:52.920
[in Norwegian]
Jan, we need to have a talk. Now.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.360
- Is anything wrong?
- Yes.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.240
I think you could say that.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.760
This went out to everyone
in the office at 2:23 today.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.720
Can you tell me what this is?

13:06.800 --> 13:12.600
It's just some pictures
we took for fun at the theater group.

13:12.680 --> 13:19.040
Do you take me for a complete idiot?
These young girls were jobseekers here.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.560
I realize this might be
a bit embarrassing.

13:31.640 --> 13:35.200
This is beyond embarrassing.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.440
Okay.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.680
What do we do about this, Reidun?

13:42.240 --> 13:47.480
I want you to turn up at the office
on Monday with your letter of resignation.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.000
Are you going to move me?

13:52.680 --> 13:58.120
Either you quit voluntarily
or you get fired.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.880
No, that won't work.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.320
This job is everything to me.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.200
People lose their jobs all the time.
Life goes on.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.160
How am I supposed keep up payments
on my mortgage?

14:17.240 --> 14:20.320
Apply for unemployment benefits.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.880
[stammers]

14:21.960 --> 14:24.760
You can't do this to me.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.680
Please.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.560
Give me a second chance.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.600
Don't make this any worse
than it has to be.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.640
[sniffling]

14:35.480 --> 14:36.800
Fuck me.

14:50.040 --> 14:54.280
[in English] Close call back there, Frank.
This time we meet on our terms.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.600
Whatever you say, Jerry.
Is the kid okay?

14:57.680 --> 15:00.040
He's alive and kickin'.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.000
Maybe if you give yourself over to us,
he can stay that way.

15:03.080 --> 15:07.760
Listen, you cocksucker. My partner here
has got some special skills

15:07.840 --> 15:12.320
and if you hurt some hairs
on that boy's head, he will hunt you down,

15:12.400 --> 15:17.760
he will find you,
and, I swear to God, he will kill you.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.320
Cool yourself down there, cowboy.
Yous been watching too many movies.

15:21.400 --> 15:25.360
It's under control.
Where you wanna do the switch?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.200
You know the truckstop
by the Hunderfossen?

15:30.280 --> 15:31.160
Yes.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.440
Meet us there in 30 minutes.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.920
Sure you know where it is?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
[in Norwegian] Yeah, yeah.
Everyone knows where it is.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.760
It's a well-known gay cruising spot.

15:42.840 --> 15:47.720
I was offered a blowjob there once
when my engine broke down.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.320
[in English] That's too much information.
Even for the CIA.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.960
Linnea?

15:56.040 --> 15:57.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.840
[in Norwegian]
Do you know where Jonas is?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.240
No, why?

16:01.320 --> 16:04.880
But you told Johnny that
you were coming here together.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.520
I haven't met either
Jonas or Johnny today.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.600
Haven't you been together
here at school today?

16:24.280 --> 16:26.520
[in English]
You think that's him?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.400
[Robert] Yeah. It's gotta be.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.040
Who are you?

16:58.120 --> 16:59.800
You Frank's partner?

17:01.680 --> 17:03.560
Sorry?

17:03.640 --> 17:05.360
You're here for the switch, right?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.720
Uh, well...

17:08.800 --> 17:13.680
I don't know what you mean,
but a switch sounds okay.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.720
What the fuck?
You're pullin' out your dick on me?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.520
What the fuck is wrong with you?

17:25.600 --> 17:27.720
Put those motherfucking pants back on.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.640
No... okay.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.080
No fag flashes his salami
on Jerry Delucci,  capische?

17:39.160 --> 17:41.360
Jerry! Get off! Get off!

17:41.440 --> 17:43.520
[indistinct arguing]

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
- Knock it off!
- You're defending this perv now?

17:49.080 --> 17:51.600
I don't know if you had some kind of bad
experience at summer camp,

17:51.680 --> 17:54.200
but your fagophobia
is interfering with work.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.720
Let the fucking guy go so we can do
what we came here for.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.720
Yeah, okay. All right?

19:04.640 --> 19:07.680
Jesus...
[panting]

19:07.760 --> 19:10.960
- What's wrong with you?
- These fuckin' trolls, they freak me out.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.480
The fuckin' thing is made out of plastic.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.680
Yeah, well... still.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.360
- Look that way.
- Right.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.960
[Johnny] What the hell is this?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.000
Hello?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.760
Kiddo?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.480
Uncle Jerry's here.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.320
[troll cackling]

20:20.680 --> 20:22.960
[gunshots echoing]

20:25.600 --> 20:28.280
- [alarm ringing]
- Fuck. Shit.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.720
For God's sake, what are you shooting at?

20:45.480 --> 20:48.200
[in Norwegian] Does it look like
they've gone down here or continued up?

20:48.280 --> 20:52.280
[in English] There's no way to tell.
I'll check the north side, you go south.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.840
Fucking trolls. He's in here.

21:49.880 --> 21:54.000
[Jerry]
Kiddo, where are you?

21:59.600 --> 22:01.600
[Robert] It's okay, kid.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.520
We know you're in here.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.760
No one's gonna hurt you.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.560
[whispers] Jonas?

22:41.240 --> 22:43.280
[gunshot echoes]

22:43.360 --> 22:44.760
What the fuck is wrong with you?

22:44.840 --> 22:47.920
Stop shooting at the kid,
you fucking psycho.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.120
I wasn't. You fucking blind?

23:09.160 --> 23:14.200
Take Jonas home. I gotta stay
and take care of some things.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.680
Be careful.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.080
[in Norwegian] Sorry to have to drag
you out here on the National Day.

23:28.160 --> 23:33.920
No problem. Breathe calmly,
and tell me what happened.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.720
[sobbing]

23:35.800 --> 23:42.000
We were having
a National Day lunch. I'm sorry.

23:42.080 --> 23:46.280
Suddenly Jonas disappeared, and we looked
for him, but we couldn't find him.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.720
I've tried to call him loads of times,
I've tried to call Johnny,

23:49.800 --> 23:56.280
and his dad in Oslo,
and I can't reach anyone.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.680
Good thing you got ahold of me, then.

24:01.640 --> 24:05.000
My colleague Hans has the evening shift
at the station.

24:05.080 --> 24:09.560
We're gonna go and together
we'll find your boy.

24:13.760 --> 24:20.720
Jonas. Maybe it's best I do the talking,
we don't want a big fuss here.

24:24.880 --> 24:29.040
Jonas, where have you been?

24:31.760 --> 24:33.520
False alarm.

24:33.600 --> 24:40.040
It was just some morons who took Jonas,
so Johnny and I had to find him.

24:40.120 --> 24:44.160
What? Who took you? Huh?

24:44.240 --> 24:47.080
It was some foreigners.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.800
If there's been an attempted kidnapping,
it has to be reported to the police.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.560
No, no. It wasn't...

24:54.640 --> 25:01.000
Well, kidnapping...
This here was more a prank sort of thing.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.600
Pranks? Well, where's Johnny now, then?

25:04.800 --> 25:07.080
Um...

25:07.160 --> 25:11.480
He had to take care of some business,
but he said to say hello.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.200
Okay, so he said to say hello?

25:17.080 --> 25:18.600
Come on, Jonas.

25:26.160 --> 25:31.720
Hello, Hans, this is Laila. Have there
been any reports of disturbances today?

25:31.800 --> 25:33.680
At Hunderfossen?

25:34.520 --> 25:38.240
Okay. I think I'll take a little trip
up there with you myself.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.720
[in English]
Congratulations.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.320
Because of your fuck up, we probably lost
Tagliano for good this time.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.720
- My fuck up?
- I fucking had him.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.560
You are some piece of work.

25:50.640 --> 25:53.840
Beating up gays. Shooting kids and trolls,
fake fuckin' trolls!

25:53.920 --> 25:55.520
You're some kind of fruitcake.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.720
Wait a second,
you calling me a fag?

25:58.800 --> 26:01.720
It's just an expression, Jerry.
You lose your focus.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.280
- No, I know the meaning of fruitcake.
- Don't be stupid.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.880
Nobody calls Jerry Delucci a fucking fag.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.040
Who's the fruitcake now?

26:12.120 --> 26:14.360
Who the fuck do you think you are
talking to me like that?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.400
I'm fucking Jerry Delucci.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.040
I've fucking had it with you.
Nobody fuck...

26:28.200 --> 26:29.720
Jerry!

26:42.080 --> 26:43.960
Put down the gun.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.520
Whoa. Take it easy, now.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.640
Walk to the right.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.160
I see a nice little burial ground for you.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.720
You always had a temper, Jerry.
Gotta wonder where that's coming from.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.560
I got a theory about all this.

27:00.640 --> 27:04.440
Has to do with your uncle Aldo
tucking you in every night.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.200
Doesn't that strike you
as a little bit weird?

27:06.280 --> 27:08.560
What are you talking about?
Get the fuck on your knees!

27:08.640 --> 27:11.280
I'll finish you off right here. Get down!

27:13.200 --> 27:15.440
Fucking son of a bitch.

27:15.520 --> 27:19.840
There was always rumors, Jerry.
You heard them.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.120
About unnecessary hanging around
public bathrooms.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.360
You're full of shit!

27:26.520 --> 27:29.720
Who told you that?
Who told you that fucking crap? Huh?

27:29.800 --> 27:31.640
Who fucking told you that?

27:43.560 --> 27:45.080
Come on.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.960
[groans]

28:10.440 --> 28:11.440
[grunts]

28:27.480 --> 28:28.800
[laughing]

28:28.880 --> 28:32.800
Well, sayonara, Frankie boy.

28:35.280 --> 28:39.160
This is what I think of your
stupid fucking theories.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.800
[gunshot echoes]

28:57.320 --> 28:59.040
I never liked the fucking guy.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.640
So now what?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.280
Now, we're both fucked.

29:21.440 --> 29:25.720
Yeah.
I always liked you, Robbie.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.840
You're old-school, you know?

29:28.920 --> 29:31.760
Got a lot of respect for you, too, Frank.

29:31.840 --> 29:37.120
But you know what it is. They tell you
to go do a job, you go do the fucking job.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.480
I know what it is.

29:41.760 --> 29:46.800
Nobody comes home,
Aldo sends the goombah third battalion.

29:46.880 --> 29:50.000
You go home without
the favorite nephew, without the job done,

29:50.080 --> 29:51.480
then you've got a problem.

29:51.560 --> 29:54.080
- Am I right?
- You're right.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.520
Well, here's what I'm thinking.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.520
You see this ring?

30:05.600 --> 30:08.800
My father gave me this ring.
It means the world to me.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.320
And Aldo knows it.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.120
So, you sell him on this scenario.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.960
Me and the nephew took each other out,

30:21.040 --> 30:23.880
you took the ring off my finger
as proof...

30:24.760 --> 30:27.640
and, uh, you know...

30:27.720 --> 30:32.520
He died defending the family honor
and all that bullshit.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.760
The credits roll.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.480
What do ya think?
Worth a shot?

30:51.800 --> 30:54.040
I think that's worth a shot.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.240
[in Norwegian]
Hey. You locking up already?

31:05.320 --> 31:06.960
I thought we were inspecting
the crime scene.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.720
I've been all over the park.

31:08.800 --> 31:13.400
There were just some dummies that had been
knocked over and a go-kart stolen.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.720
Typical college kid pranks.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.160
Actually, we've reason to believe

31:18.240 --> 31:21.080
that something far more serious
has been going on.

31:21.160 --> 31:24.360
Is it terrorists lurking about again,
like at the ski race?

31:24.440 --> 31:26.720
Very funny.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.280
I've already spoke with your boss.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.600
He agreed that there was no need
to give this priority.

31:32.680 --> 31:36.680
Yes, I expect he did. But you're sure
there's no one in there then?

31:36.760 --> 31:39.080
One hundred percent.

31:41.240 --> 31:44.600
Though, I think maybe I saw
Osama bin Laden hiding in the Viking ship.

31:44.680 --> 31:49.920
You're cracking me up. Good night.
Come on, Hans, we're going.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.880
[classical music playing]

32:11.560 --> 32:16.720
You know what, Hans? Tonight we'll let
the dunderheads sail on their own lake.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.280
Sounds like a good plan.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.080
I just took some roll cake
out of the oven.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.440
Would you like to come and have a piece?

32:24.520 --> 32:27.920
Do I look like the kind of person
who says no to roll cake?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.960
[laughing] No.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.200
[Laila] Wait a minute. Stop.

33:18.280 --> 33:23.360
Little angry Jerry Delucci, ending up
in a ditch in the Norwegian woods.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.520
All because of the Olympics.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.240
How so?

33:28.320 --> 33:33.360
If I wasn't watching in '94,
I wouldn't have picked this place to come.

33:33.440 --> 33:38.320
You wouldn't be here trying to whack me,
and that fuck wouldn't be lying face-down.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.640
- God works in mysterious ways.
- Yeah.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.480
Don't look now, but Little Green
Riding Hood is right behind you.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.640
Fuck.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.200
[in Norwegian]
And what is going on here?

33:48.280 --> 33:50.320
[in English]
Hello, Officer.

33:52.560 --> 33:56.560
Just two foreigners enjoying
what Norway has to offer.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.720
[in Norwegian]
Is that so?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.440
[in English]
And where is your charming friend?

34:10.760 --> 34:12.880
[in Norwegian]
I don't like the sound of this.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.160
Come in, Hans.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.520
Hans?

34:20.680 --> 34:24.280
[in English]
Listen, uh, that guy, Jerry.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.400
He had everything to do
with the death of your friend.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.280
I knew it.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.440
I knew it.

34:40.520 --> 34:43.080
So, uh, now you're at a crossroads.

34:44.760 --> 34:49.120
You can spend thousands of taxpayer
kroner servicing justice

34:49.200 --> 34:51.920
for the creep that killed your friend,

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
or you can enjoy May 17th
hot dogs and cakes,

34:56.080 --> 34:59.720
and be thankful somebody took care
of what you should have took care of

34:59.800 --> 35:01.600
when you had the chance.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.960
[in Norwegian]
I think I need one of those.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.640
[in English]
Didn't know you smoked, Officer.

35:11.800 --> 35:14.000
Not since ten years.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.960
[Hans in Norwegian]
Laila? Did you call me? Over.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.200
Yes, hello, Hans. It's...

35:26.280 --> 35:29.800
Anything wrong?
Should I call the central?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.240
Laila?

35:33.320 --> 35:35.800
I just wanted to say...

35:37.520 --> 35:42.480
That it's time to go back
and have some roll cake. Over.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.560
[in English] Okay, guys.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.200
Close call.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.640
I knew she'd go for the cakes.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.280
All right, well, uh...

36:11.600 --> 36:13.600
Enjoy life as a dead man.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.320
Tell me about it.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.320
Jonas okay?

37:07.400 --> 37:08.600
Yeah.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.600
Uh-huh.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.280
Well, that's good.
Then we can move on.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.680
"Move on"?
[in Norwegian] Are you for real?

37:16.760 --> 37:21.240
[in English] I'm so tired of this:
You lying to me, keeping secrets from me.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.280
I don't know who you really are.

37:23.360 --> 37:27.080
Look, I'm not the bad guy here.
I'm the guy trying to fix this thing.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.040
[in Norwegian]
Is everything all right here?

37:32.120 --> 37:34.160
[in English]
Who's the douche bag?

37:34.240 --> 37:36.320
[in Norwegian]
I'm Ivar, Sigrid's husband.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.280
- No, you're not.
- Ex-husband, that is.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.720
[in English]
What the fuck's he doing here?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.440
[in Norwegian]
I came when I heard Jonas was in trouble.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.440
I happen to have a sense of responsibility
towards my son.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.720
[in English]
Well, excuse me. If you don't mind,

37:47.800 --> 37:50.800
I'm tryin' to have a private conversation
with my girl here. Okay?

37:52.160 --> 37:55.760
[in Norwegian]
I don't like your tone...

37:55.840 --> 37:57.840
so I'm afraid we're going
to have to ask you to leave.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.720
Oh, come on.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.160
[in English] Look, I suggest
you stay the fuck out of this, all right?

38:02.240 --> 38:05.320
[in Norwegian] I'm warning you.
I'm a regional jujitsu champion.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.160
Oh, Lord.
Will you just please stop?

38:08.240 --> 38:11.600
[in English] Okay, okay.
We will continue this conversation

38:11.680 --> 38:14.320
when Bruce Lee goes back to China.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.120
[in Norwegian] Go in.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.880
I don't know what to say.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.560
[in English] That's it?

38:27.880 --> 38:30.280
It's over just like that?

39:34.800 --> 39:39.040
[in Norwegian]   Why, hello?
Is it you I'm going to see now?

39:39.120 --> 39:42.280
No, it won't be me today.

39:42.360 --> 39:44.240
[woman over PA]
That's number 226.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.760
Oh, why've you got a number?

39:49.840 --> 39:51.680
Number 226.

40:05.200 --> 40:10.520
[in English] Excuse me.
Johnny, do you have five minutes, please?

40:11.800 --> 40:12.960
No.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.920
I got four.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.120
Yeah, we...

40:22.800 --> 40:27.160
[in Norwegian]   We've known each other
for some time now, Johnny.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.720
[in English]
Jan. While we're young.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.200
What the fuck do you want?

40:34.280 --> 40:39.120
[in Norwegian]   The thing is,
I've become a jobseeker.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.560
I thought maybe...

40:42.640 --> 40:44.440
[in English]
Are you askin' for a job?

40:44.520 --> 40:47.040
[laughs] Yeah.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.760
[in Norwegian]
Things have unfortunately become

40:48.840 --> 40:51.040
disagreeable with my former employer.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.400
[in English]
Sounds rough.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.000
Well...

40:58.080 --> 41:02.440
I don't think there's a whole lot
of positions open at the moment.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.720
But let me look here.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.800
Dishwasher position.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.200
Interested?

41:15.240 --> 41:20.800
You know, actually, I was thinking
a bit more about some kind of...

41:21.800 --> 41:24.040
management job.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.240
You can't start at the top!

41:26.320 --> 41:28.560
You need a reality check, my friend.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.440
Please. Um...

41:37.800 --> 41:39.640
I have nowhere else to go.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.720
This is Norway, right?

41:50.800 --> 41:53.480
The land of second chances.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.320
[in Norwegian]
New chance.

41:58.120 --> 42:03.720
[in English] All right,
consider yourself employed.

42:03.800 --> 42:07.480
Yes? Thank you very much.

42:07.560 --> 42:11.520
Thank you very much. Have you thought
about the job description.

42:11.600 --> 42:15.040
- Maybe...
- Torgeir needs help with the staff.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.240
Like with Svetlana and Jelena?

42:18.320 --> 42:21.000
Believe me, they are a handful, my friend.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.400
That's magnificent.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.280
[playing slow jazzy melody]

42:25.360 --> 42:28.640
You really won't regret this,
I promise you.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.000
I have a lot of good ideas already.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.840
- Oh, yeah?
- Sure.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.720
For example,
the go-go dance on Thursdays.

42:34.800 --> 42:38.720
[in Norwegian]
The girls, they are from Ukraine, right?

42:38.800 --> 42:40.480
[in English] I believe so. Why?

42:40.560 --> 42:45.400
[in Norwegian] I've a friend on the county
council who works on cultural events...

42:45.480 --> 42:51.080
[in English] Cultural exchange.
I could get us economic support.

42:51.160 --> 42:53.640
- They'll give us money?
- Sure, sure.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.520
[in Norwegian] With the right application
we can get half a million.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.240
[in English]
He owes me big time.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.280
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.800
I hope so.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.560
- All right.
- Hello, hi.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.560
You didn't send the flowers?

43:12.640 --> 43:16.680
I'm so sorry, boss, but they came back.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.520
[Johnny]
Play that song I like.

43:37.320 --> 43:40.920
- [singing "Back to Love"]
- [playing melancholy melody]

44:34.560 --> 44:37.440
[Ingrid Olava's "Back to Love" continuing]
