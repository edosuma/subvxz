I've gotta get out of here.

09:29.561 --> 09:32.129
I'm roommates with a guy
who thinks he's Nicolas Cage.

Okay, let's ride!

09:33.565 --> 09:36.133
Or maybe that is Nicolas Cage.
I don't know.

Usually, he's a real chatterbox,

First, we're going to
tunnel through the wall

- Oh, shit!
- Trying to escape, huh?

- You get an ice cream.

- Choco taco?
- Steve, you can't get an abortion!

17:37.551 --> 17:41.420
Yes, I can!
My body, my choice!

17:41.422 --> 17:43.755
- He's right!
- But it was in my body first,

17:43.757 --> 17:46.024
- so it's still my choice.
- She's right!

17:46.026 --> 17:47.593
But it was my seed,

17:47.595 --> 17:51.630
so I should make the
choice for everybody.

17:51.632 --> 17:54.533
- Anybody else confused?
- Yeah, I am.

17:54.535 --> 17:57.069
I say we all agree
to kill this [bleep]

17:57.071 --> 17:58.770
and go to Hooters and
look at some titties.

17:58.772 --> 18:00.906
Sounds good to me. I'm a lesbian.

Just one problem: My water broke.

Well, looks like I'll have to
kill this thing on the outside.

Ethel, hold his hand.

<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

18:50.225 --> 18:51.892
<i>I guess I have to spring
him from that nuthouse.</i>

18:51.894 --> 18:54.027
[barks]

18:54.029 --> 18:55.195
[pop]

18:55.197 --> 18:59.032
<i>- I want to be inside you.
- Why is that thing glowing?</i>

18:59.034 --> 19:02.436
Happy tree. Happy tree.
Happy tree.

19:02.438 --> 19:05.372
Does something seem
weird about Woody?

19:05.374 --> 19:07.274
- No.
- Woody, pack your straitjacket.

19:07.276 --> 19:08.442
We're getting out of here.

19:08.444 --> 19:11.411
Ah! No! The demon from my mind!

19:11.413 --> 19:13.513
Get away from me! You're not real!

19:13.515 --> 19:15.015
Is this real?

19:15.017 --> 19:18.118
- Jesus Christ!
- Ha ha! Yes, my son?

19:18.120 --> 19:20.554
[sighs] Hey, doc.
Turns out I can talk.

19:20.556 --> 19:23.223
So I'll be taking home the
fat, the black, and the ugly.

19:23.225 --> 19:27.060
It's a talking bear!
It's a talking bear!

19:27.062 --> 19:29.196
- Growl.
- It's a talking bear!

19:29.198 --> 19:31.698
No! No! You saw it! He was
talking! He's a mother...

19:31.700 --> 19:33.433
<i>he was talking!</i>

19:33.435 --> 19:36.436
Oh, no! Not the bees!
Not the bees!

19:36.438 --> 19:41.441
Ahh! My eyes! My eyes!
[gibberish]

19:41.443 --> 19:43.043
[coughs]

19:44.979 --> 19:46.713
Here comes that bundle of joy.

19:46.715 --> 19:49.149
This is gonna be the
greatest day of my life.

19:49.151 --> 19:51.985
Congratulations.
You've given birth to a beautiful,

19:51.987 --> 19:54.488
5-pound, 2-ounce tumor.

19:54.490 --> 19:55.922
<i>All: What?</i>

19:55.924 --> 19:57.624
But how is that possible?

19:57.626 --> 19:59.593
Hmm, I guess you never were pregnant.

19:59.595 --> 20:02.596
I must have transferred an
ovarian cyst from Ethel's body

20:02.598 --> 20:04.464
into yours, thinking it was an embryo.

20:04.466 --> 20:07.000
What about the
ultrasound and the checkups

20:07.002 --> 20:10.670
- and the Skymall DNA test?
- Well, Skymall products are shit.

20:10.672 --> 20:12.506
The rest are oversights that result

20:12.508 --> 20:15.475
from having your own prescription pad.

20:16.677 --> 20:18.345
Well, I'm out of here,

20:18.347 --> 20:21.515
using my patented Skymall
flying squirrel suit.

20:21.517 --> 20:23.517
Skymall!
[glass shatters]

20:23.519 --> 20:25.185
[crash]
[car alarm blares]

20:25.187 --> 20:27.454
All right. I'm leaving.

20:27.456 --> 20:32.159
Wait. So if it was a tumor,
whose choice was it?

20:32.161 --> 20:34.327
You don't know. You don't know.

20:34.329 --> 20:35.595
You don't know.

20:35.597 --> 20:39.332
And none of us do, frankly.
Abortion is a very complicated issue.

20:39.334 --> 20:42.269
Oh, who gives a shit?
I thought we were going to Hooters.

20:42.271 --> 20:43.603
Well, all's well that ends well.

20:43.605 --> 20:45.505
I'll go grind this into taco meat.

20:45.507 --> 20:49.543
No! Mwah.
I'm keeping it!

20:49.545 --> 20:51.211
Aah!
