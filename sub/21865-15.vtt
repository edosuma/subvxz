WEBVTT

00:02.304 --> 00:04.342
Our diamond rings
are right over here.

00:04.342 --> 00:06.547
Yes, ma'am, we'll take care
of that special order for you.

00:06.547 --> 00:07.883
You'd like to take a look,
let me show you.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.887
Yeah, I'd like
to look at this one.

00:09.887 --> 00:11.657
SALESMAN:
Of course.

00:11.657 --> 00:13.393
The best choice.
MAN:
I'm not sure of the quality.

00:13.393 --> 00:15.632
SALESMAN:
Yes...

00:15.632 --> 00:17.268
(laughs)

00:17.268 --> 00:18.103
MAN:
It's beautiful.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.740
WOMAN:
Yeah, that's really pretty.

00:19.740 --> 00:20.742
Mm‐hmm.

00:20.742 --> 00:21.677
(smacking lips)

00:28.490 --> 00:30.795
You think this looks good?

00:30.795 --> 00:32.298
Try the Audi dealer on Wilshire.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.770
Hand to God,
best Cronuts this side

00:34.770 --> 00:35.805
of the 405.

00:35.805 --> 00:37.509
Change your life.
Danish?

00:37.509 --> 00:39.746
No.
Uh, yeah, no.

00:39.746 --> 00:41.316
Thank you, but
this isn't Costco.
Herb...

00:41.316 --> 00:42.619
I‐I‐I'm trying,
I'm trying.

00:42.619 --> 00:45.223
That's why I can't find
the deck chairs.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.698
Oh, shoot.

00:48.698 --> 00:49.432
Got some runners.

00:49.432 --> 00:50.902
(gunshot)
(customers scream)

00:50.902 --> 00:53.808
On the ground now!

00:53.808 --> 00:56.279
ROBBER 2:
Wallets, watches,
jewelry in the bag.

00:56.279 --> 00:58.283
Let's go! Let's go!
In the bag!

00:58.283 --> 00:59.886
If you do not want
a gun in your face,

00:59.886 --> 01:03.293
hand your watches and jewelry...
Let's go, everybody.

01:03.293 --> 01:04.663
Let's go, come on.
If you don't want a bullet

01:04.663 --> 01:05.932
in your brain, do not...

01:05.932 --> 01:07.936
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

01:07.936 --> 01:09.606
Everything in the bag.
Right now.

01:09.606 --> 01:11.610
That means you, beautiful.
Ring, too.

01:11.610 --> 01:12.946
No. Are you crazy?
This is my wedding ring.

01:12.946 --> 01:13.881
Give me the damn ring!
No!

01:13.881 --> 01:15.017
Give him the ring.
Was I talking to you?

01:15.017 --> 01:15.952
Don't you have
enough already?
I wasn't talking to you.

01:15.952 --> 01:17.989
Take it easy!
I was not talking to you!

01:17.989 --> 01:19.291
Shut your
damn mouth!

01:19.291 --> 01:20.427
(gunshot)
(screams)

01:21.964 --> 01:23.768
Next one goes
between the dimples.

01:27.007 --> 01:28.410
(robber grunting)

01:29.513 --> 01:30.347
What?

01:30.347 --> 01:31.583
I come prepared.

01:31.583 --> 01:32.719
You crazy bitch!

01:32.719 --> 01:34.355
(horn blares)

01:36.259 --> 01:38.363
Okay, that
I wasn't prepared for.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.607
MURTAUGH:
<i>Look up in the sky!</i>

01:43.607 --> 01:45.845
It's a bird,
it's a plane,

01:45.845 --> 01:49.986
it's Super Harper!

01:49.986 --> 01:51.122
Wow.

01:51.122 --> 01:53.426
Looks like you two have
a really special relationship.

01:53.426 --> 01:54.996
Yeah. (laughs)

01:54.996 --> 01:56.600
It takes hard work,
you know?

01:56.600 --> 01:59.338
But this is the
reward, you know?

01:59.338 --> 02:00.942
Yeah, yeah, I feel you.

02:00.942 --> 02:04.549
Makes me wish Duncan's grandpa
was as involved as you.

02:06.553 --> 02:07.622
Grandpa?

02:07.622 --> 02:09.693
I'm 32 and I can barely keep up.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.496
You're a hero.

02:11.496 --> 02:12.966
Oh. Monkey bars are calling.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.536
Enjoy the rest of your day, sir.

02:14.536 --> 02:16.005
(quietly):
Sir?

02:16.005 --> 02:17.742
TRISH: All right.
I'm back!

02:17.742 --> 02:19.546
(laughs)
I'm sorry.

02:19.546 --> 02:22.652
My boss is on a warpath
because of this merger.

02:22.652 --> 02:23.788
Yes, he is.

02:23.788 --> 02:24.790
(laughs)

02:26.527 --> 02:27.327
Roger?

02:27.327 --> 02:29.833
What happened?
That haircut just...

02:29.833 --> 02:32.337
called me Harper's grandpa.

02:32.337 --> 02:34.576
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

02:34.576 --> 02:35.912
(laughs)

02:35.912 --> 02:36.980
Your first "grandpa."

02:36.980 --> 02:38.082
What do you mean, "first"?

02:38.082 --> 02:39.986
Well, it's not out
of the question.

02:39.986 --> 02:42.357
There are grandfathers your age.

02:42.357 --> 02:44.963
But 52 isn't what it used to be.

02:44.963 --> 02:46.199
Right, baby?

02:46.199 --> 02:49.004
No, it's not.
Someone needs to tell that
to the haircut.

02:49.004 --> 02:50.373
Oh, okay.

02:50.373 --> 02:51.475
You want to go on...

02:51.475 --> 02:53.379
play on the jungle gym
with your dad?

02:53.379 --> 02:54.583
Yeah.
Okay. Come on.

02:54.583 --> 02:55.885
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing, Roger?

02:55.885 --> 02:57.522
Don't worry
about what I'm doing.

02:57.522 --> 02:58.791
Come on,
we're gonna go have fun.

02:58.791 --> 03:02.532
Me and you. We're gonna go
in there in the slide.

03:02.532 --> 03:04.603
Yeah. Ow. Ooh, that hurt.
Sir, sir?

03:04.603 --> 03:05.838
That's actually
made for children.

03:05.838 --> 03:07.441
Let me get in first.

03:07.441 --> 03:08.811
Yep.
(laughs)

03:08.811 --> 03:09.880
That was easy.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.449
All right, here we go.

03:11.449 --> 03:14.923
One, two, three.
Whoa.

03:14.923 --> 03:15.925
There she is!
Hey!

03:15.925 --> 03:17.060
Whoa‐‐ hey, hey.

03:17.060 --> 03:18.697
(whoops)
Trish, I'm stuck.

03:18.697 --> 03:21.102
(banging)
Oh, my gosh, Roger.

03:21.102 --> 03:22.471
Can you slide
yourself out?

03:22.471 --> 03:24.008
What do you think "stuck" means?

03:24.008 --> 03:25.377
Sir? Sir?

03:25.377 --> 03:26.647
I'm a firefighter.

03:26.647 --> 03:27.849
Hang tight.
I'm stuck.

03:27.849 --> 03:28.651
I'll call it in.

03:28.651 --> 03:31.122
Your grandpa's gonna be
just fine.

03:31.122 --> 03:33.059
MURTAUGH:
I'm‐I'm not the grandpa.

03:33.059 --> 03:35.731
Uh... Hey, Trish?

03:35.731 --> 03:36.934
Huh?

03:36.934 --> 03:38.069
Is anybody watching?

03:38.069 --> 03:39.572
Nope.

03:39.572 --> 03:40.975
No, nobody's watching.

03:40.975 --> 03:45.618
Good. Let's just keep this
between us, all right?

03:55.437 --> 03:56.640
Morning, ladies.
Hey.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.875
(woman speaks indistinctly)

03:59.411 --> 04:01.315
(screaming)

04:08.931 --> 04:10.935
Hey, I need you to slap me.

04:10.935 --> 04:13.607
As much as I'd love to, why?

04:13.607 --> 04:14.809
I don't know,
something's off in my game,

04:14.809 --> 04:16.445
and I feel like my reflexes
need to be tested,

04:16.445 --> 04:17.548
so just go ahead and slap me.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.817
Riggs, I'm a medical
professional.

04:18.817 --> 04:21.656
I'm not gonna...

04:21.656 --> 04:22.525
Thank you.

04:22.525 --> 04:23.894
Would you like me
to slap you again?

04:23.894 --> 04:25.631
Or would you like to
tell me what's going on?

04:25.631 --> 04:27.167
Because I am good with either.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.737
(sighs)
I don't know.

04:28.737 --> 04:30.741
I'm shooting whiskey bottles
this morning, right?

04:30.741 --> 04:32.645
And I miss one,
and I never miss one.

04:32.645 --> 04:33.346
Wait.

04:33.346 --> 04:36.185
You were shooting at bottles?

04:36.185 --> 04:37.622
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's, you know...

04:37.622 --> 04:39.458
I‐I shoot at the whiskey
that I want to drink.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.694
It's kind of part of my process.

04:40.694 --> 04:42.431
What if you don't
have any bottles?

04:42.431 --> 04:43.700
Well, then I, like, shove
a thumbtack into my finger.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.704
Or sometimes
a paper clip under the nail.

04:45.704 --> 04:47.474
That usually
holds me over.

04:47.474 --> 04:49.979
Riggs, that's‐that's
really concerning.

04:49.979 --> 04:51.516
Yeah, but effective.
(clicks tongue)

04:51.516 --> 04:54.722
Is it possible
that you feel broken

04:54.722 --> 04:56.492
because you're not drinking?

04:58.931 --> 05:01.469
You mean, like how Popeye
needs his spinach?

05:01.469 --> 05:02.872
No. No, no. More like...

05:02.872 --> 05:05.143
more like, this newfound
clarity is unnerving,

05:05.143 --> 05:06.880
and‐and that's
why you feel off.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.750
No, no, I like
the Popeye analogy.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.153
The alcohol is what
gave me my edge.

05:10.153 --> 05:12.457
Of course.

05:12.457 --> 05:13.894
(chuckles softly)

05:13.894 --> 05:15.965
Thanks, Doc.

05:15.965 --> 05:17.067
(door opens)

05:17.067 --> 05:19.138
Beautiful day for a crime scene.

05:19.138 --> 05:20.774
MURTAUGH:
You seem chipper.

05:20.774 --> 05:22.110
And sober.

05:22.110 --> 05:24.014
I'm glad to see that, uh,

05:24.014 --> 05:26.485
support group I recommended
is working out.

05:26.485 --> 05:27.722
No, that was garbage.

05:27.722 --> 05:29.024
I stopped going to that.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.561
Too much complaining.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.865
You know? Besides, there was
only a two‐cookie limit.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.969
I should've known
you couldn't cut it.

05:34.969 --> 05:38.710
You are biologically incapable
of following the rules.

05:38.710 --> 05:42.752
No, see, I choose
not to follow stupid rules.

05:42.752 --> 05:43.854
There's a difference.

05:43.854 --> 05:45.156
Besides, I got it under control.

05:45.156 --> 05:47.027
That's the most ridiculous
thing I ever heard.

05:47.027 --> 05:49.031
Really?

05:49.031 --> 05:49.899
The most ridiculous?

05:49.899 --> 05:52.170
Well, did you hear
the one about the guy

05:52.170 --> 05:54.542
that got stuck on a slide
for an hour and a half?

05:54.542 --> 05:56.713
'Cause that was
pretty crazy.

05:56.713 --> 05:57.748
Trish told you about that?

05:57.748 --> 05:59.786
Yeah, she thought
that you were gonna be late.

05:59.786 --> 06:01.890
So, tell me, Rog,
the Jaws of Life‐‐

06:01.890 --> 06:03.560
how are they,
up close and personal?

06:03.560 --> 06:04.996
BOWMAN:
Morning!
I'll cut your nose off

06:04.996 --> 06:07.100
if you tell a soul.
Our victim's name

06:07.100 --> 06:08.069
is Dan McTeer,

06:08.069 --> 06:10.473
and in a shocking twist,
he's also our bad guy.

06:10.473 --> 06:11.576
Oh, beautiful.

06:11.576 --> 06:13.079
I'm going back home.
This way.

06:13.079 --> 06:15.851
He and a buddy ripped off
this jewelry store.

06:15.851 --> 06:18.624
High‐tech stuff, took out
security cameras, alarms.

06:18.624 --> 06:20.694
And, uh...
Ah, let me guess.

06:21.863 --> 06:23.667
He was poisoned.
SCORSESE:
I wish.

06:23.667 --> 06:24.869
Hit by a delivery truck

06:24.869 --> 06:25.537
whilst fleeing.

06:25.537 --> 06:27.675
Complete waste
of my talents.

06:27.675 --> 06:29.177
Did the truck shoot him, too?

06:29.177 --> 06:30.213
That would be her.

06:30.213 --> 06:33.920
Bystander packing a .357 Magnum
in her pocketbook.

06:33.920 --> 06:34.922
SCORSESE: And we already
bagged the weapon,

06:34.922 --> 06:35.858
so it's, like,
I don't know.

06:35.858 --> 06:37.595
Challenge me?
MURTAUGH:
Okay, well,

06:37.595 --> 06:38.797
I'll take the witnesses.

06:38.797 --> 06:40.066
Riggs, why don't you get
an official statement

06:40.066 --> 06:41.135
from the shooter?

06:41.135 --> 06:44.074
Unless it's too hard for you
to follow the rules.

06:44.074 --> 06:45.944
Oh, I'll be fine.

06:45.944 --> 06:48.282
Let me know if you get stuck.

06:48.282 --> 06:49.986
(siren chirping)

06:52.223 --> 06:53.894
All right.

06:53.894 --> 06:54.962
Name.

06:54.962 --> 06:56.332
Ruthie Krumholz.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.968
Spelled exactly like it sounds.

06:57.968 --> 06:58.770
Address.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.173
Home is where you park it,
honey.

07:01.743 --> 07:03.747
You don't have an address?

07:03.747 --> 07:04.949
Just put "The Open Road."

07:06.686 --> 07:08.155
Phone number.

07:08.155 --> 07:09.559
(laughing):
Oh.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.195
So Uncle Sam can listen in
on calls

07:11.195 --> 07:12.565
with my chiropodist?

07:12.565 --> 07:14.134
Nice try.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.136
(sighs)

07:15.136 --> 07:17.140
All right.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.877
Okay. There we go.

07:18.877 --> 07:22.283
Hey. Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

07:22.283 --> 07:23.352
I'm grabbing your registration.

07:23.352 --> 07:25.624
You're entering my home
without probable cause.

07:25.624 --> 07:27.093
That's unlawful search
and seizure.

07:27.093 --> 07:28.964
Well, you're being
a pain in my ass,

07:28.964 --> 07:30.968
and I'm trying to prove a point
to my partner.

07:30.968 --> 07:32.571
So this is keeping me
from freaking out.

07:32.571 --> 07:35.577
Oh, you are in for it now, bub.

07:35.577 --> 07:37.013
Alan Dershowitz
owes me a favor.

07:37.013 --> 07:38.082
(dialing)

07:40.286 --> 07:43.693
Oh! What?
Look what you did!

07:43.693 --> 07:45.229
What the hell is wrong with you?

07:46.599 --> 07:48.870
I did not see that coming.

07:49.772 --> 07:51.876
♪ ♪

07:56.719 --> 07:58.757
Hot off the presses.

07:58.757 --> 08:01.061
The invoice for
my RV repairs.

08:01.061 --> 08:04.167
Ah. The department will, uh,
take care of that.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.739
Nope. Damage was done
during an illegal search.

08:06.739 --> 08:09.010
They say
it's on you.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.213
(clears throat)

08:10.213 --> 08:12.116
"Faulty transmission,

08:12.116 --> 08:15.189
leaky gaskets..." wait.

08:15.189 --> 08:16.191
That's not me.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.628
Well, I disagree.

08:17.628 --> 08:19.164
Classic he said, she said.

08:19.164 --> 08:21.268
I'll pay for your door.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.172
That's it.

08:23.172 --> 08:25.309
I'm not leaving.

08:25.309 --> 08:26.880
Fine. Get comfortable.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.384
Don't test me, Detective.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.656
I once staged an
anti‐Nixon sit‐in

08:31.656 --> 08:33.125
at the White House
for six days.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.697
Kissinger still calls me
on my birthday.

08:35.697 --> 08:36.900
Bowman.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.337
What do we have on the robbery?

08:39.337 --> 08:40.807
Um, I pulled security footage

08:40.807 --> 08:42.310
from the area around
the crime scene.

08:42.310 --> 08:44.147
(sneezes)

08:44.147 --> 08:46.853
What the...
is there a cat in here?

08:46.853 --> 08:48.088
(blows nose)

08:49.124 --> 08:50.426
Ignore her.

08:50.426 --> 08:52.998
Uh, this is from
the traffic cam.

08:52.998 --> 08:55.069
There's our robber
making a getaway.

08:55.069 --> 08:56.706
But we can't get
an angle on the plate.

08:56.706 --> 08:57.908
RUTHIE:
I know the plate.

08:59.745 --> 09:00.714
You do?

09:00.714 --> 09:02.050
This morning
at the jewelry store,

09:02.050 --> 09:03.720
I tried to park next
to that schmuck,

09:03.720 --> 09:04.789
but he was
over the line.

09:04.789 --> 09:05.724
I couldn't fit in.

09:05.724 --> 09:07.895
I had to circle the block
for ten minutes.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.132
Ugh, hate
when that happens.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.036
I wrote down the plate
to report him.

09:13.105 --> 09:14.407
(paper tearing)

09:14.407 --> 09:15.711
(clears throat)

09:17.715 --> 09:19.384
Thank you.

09:19.384 --> 09:22.190
You pay for my RV?

09:22.190 --> 09:24.862
That's extortion.

09:24.862 --> 09:26.131
Is it working?

09:26.131 --> 09:28.870
If it pans out,

09:28.870 --> 09:30.974
then, yes,
I will pay for your RV.

09:30.974 --> 09:33.112
Hmm.

09:33.112 --> 09:34.749
And a hotel.

09:34.749 --> 09:37.855
That was my home
you mangled.

09:37.855 --> 09:39.124
(chuckles)
It's not gonna happen.

09:40.961 --> 09:42.230
You're just gonna eat it?

09:45.804 --> 09:47.073
One night.

09:47.073 --> 09:49.879
One night.

09:49.879 --> 09:51.883
Was that so hard?

09:53.920 --> 09:55.389
RIGGS:
<i>She demanded that I put her</i>

09:55.389 --> 09:56.491
<i>in a hotel with a heated pool.</i>

09:56.491 --> 09:58.830
Who the hell needs
a heated pool?

09:58.830 --> 10:00.332
Right? I‐Isn't that
what bathtubs are for?

10:00.332 --> 10:03.172
Riggs, why didn't
you just tell her no?

10:03.172 --> 10:04.307
I tried.

10:04.307 --> 10:06.913
It's like ever since I quit
drinking, I've lost my edge.

10:06.913 --> 10:09.451
Your edge.

10:09.451 --> 10:11.154
(brakes squeal)

10:11.154 --> 10:15.496
Riggs, you don't need
booze to be crazy.

10:15.496 --> 10:18.536
This coming from the guy who
thought he could fit in a slide.

10:18.536 --> 10:20.907
Come on, Rog, face it.

10:20.907 --> 10:22.477
We're off our game.

10:22.477 --> 10:24.080
Don't lump me in with you.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.284
I'm operating at
peak performance.

10:26.284 --> 10:27.988
Hmm.

10:28.455 --> 10:30.426
MURTAUGH:
There's our thief.

10:32.998 --> 10:35.102
(engine revs)

10:37.473 --> 10:39.244
Who's he meeting?

10:41.314 --> 10:42.584
(engine starts)
MURTAUGH:
It's a drop.

10:42.584 --> 10:44.254
Let's roll.
(tires screeching)

10:44.254 --> 10:46.993
(siren chirping)

10:48.495 --> 10:50.065
Hands on the trunk!

10:50.065 --> 10:51.168
(car doors close)

10:51.168 --> 10:52.436
Hands on the trunk.

10:55.442 --> 10:57.380
You, step out of the car now.

10:57.380 --> 10:59.952
(engine revving)

10:59.952 --> 11:01.923
("Sabotage"
by Beastie Boys playing)

11:03.526 --> 11:04.995
Rog, what are you doing?

11:04.995 --> 11:06.866
I got this!

11:08.268 --> 11:08.837

12:50.072 --> 12:51.007
Neat trick,
sending a self‐driving car

12:51.007 --> 12:53.245
for the drop‐off.
But you know and I know

12:53.245 --> 12:55.049
someone had to be
controlling it.

12:55.049 --> 12:57.153
RIGGS:
Perhaps, although

12:57.153 --> 13:00.092
we could have
a <i>Knight Rider</i> situation.

13:00.092 --> 13:01.529
That's a good point.

13:01.529 --> 13:04.434
Are we dealing with a
<i>Knight Rider</i> kind of situation?

13:07.239 --> 13:10.345
Uh, I'm not sure
what a <i>Knight Rider</i> is,

13:10.345 --> 13:13.519
but I got no idea
who owns the car.

What the hell did you just...?

13:15.623 --> 13:17.627
You don't know
who KITT is?
Hasselhoff?

13:17.627 --> 13:19.497
Do they work here or...?

13:19.497 --> 13:21.134
I don't even know
how to respond to that.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.637
Look, Beck,

13:22.637 --> 13:24.140
you've pulled robberies

13:24.140 --> 13:26.077
for hire across the Southwest.

13:26.077 --> 13:27.413
Who hired you this time?

13:27.413 --> 13:30.687
Did you just flinch?
Did he just flinch?

13:30.687 --> 13:32.056
Mm‐hmm, that was
definitely a flinch.

13:32.056 --> 13:33.593
Look, man, I don't
want any trouble.

13:33.593 --> 13:35.295
I‐I saw you on that car.
You're crazy.

13:35.295 --> 13:37.032
You're damn right I'm crazy.

13:37.032 --> 13:38.401
And you keep not talking,

13:38.401 --> 13:41.575
you're gonna just see
how loco I can get.

13:41.575 --> 13:42.577
I told you,

13:42.577 --> 13:44.080
I don't know anything.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.251
Where's my phone book?!
Is there a phone...?
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, tiger,

13:46.251 --> 13:49.290
tiger, tiger, let me, uh,
let me take a run at him.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.127
Just, you know,
just ease there.

13:51.127 --> 13:53.031
(Riggs sighs heavily)

13:53.031 --> 13:55.703
Armed robbery.
(whistles)

13:55.703 --> 13:57.039
What is that, three to nine?

13:57.039 --> 13:59.711
Look, I get my gigs
on the Dark Web.

13:59.711 --> 14:01.949
Clients keep us
out of the loop on purpose.

14:01.949 --> 14:02.984
In case you end up here.

14:02.984 --> 14:04.187
Yeah.

14:04.187 --> 14:05.222
I didn't even know the guy

14:05.222 --> 14:06.324
I pulled the job with.

14:06.324 --> 14:08.395
The buyer took
care of timing,

14:08.395 --> 14:09.497
drop‐off,

14:09.497 --> 14:11.267
even hacked
the store's security.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.336
All without showing his face.

14:12.336 --> 14:13.438
But you got paid online.

14:13.438 --> 14:16.211
So don't you have his account
information?
No.

14:16.211 --> 14:17.747
Bitcoin's anonymous.

14:17.747 --> 14:19.551
It's kind of the whole
point of the Dark Web.

14:22.089 --> 14:24.227
Wait, do you not know
what that is?

14:24.227 --> 14:27.066
(scoffs)
Of course I know what that is.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.370
I don't know.
The Dark Web?
It's the black market

14:29.370 --> 14:31.207
of the Internet‐‐
drugs, guns, murder‐‐

14:31.207 --> 14:32.711
all anonymous,
all for sale.

14:32.711 --> 14:35.015
Maybe it's an age thing.

14:35.015 --> 14:36.417
We're only six
years apart.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.723
And why do you know about
the Dark Web and I don't?

14:38.723 --> 14:40.259
Korean skin care.

14:40.259 --> 14:42.296
(clears throat)
Look, not all ointments

14:42.296 --> 14:44.400
are exactly legal
in the States.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.637
Why not?
What's in 'em?

14:45.637 --> 14:46.404
People?

14:47.507 --> 14:48.509
What's important here
is that we know

14:48.509 --> 14:50.178
we're looking for someone
who's tech‐savvy.

14:50.178 --> 14:51.281
With flawless skin.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.251
BOWMAN:
Hey.

14:53.251 --> 14:54.554
So, the driverless car
is registered

14:54.554 --> 14:56.291
through a bunch
of shell corporations

14:56.291 --> 14:57.727
to one Herb Weiss.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.798
MURTAUGH:
Hmm. That's the husky fella

14:59.798 --> 15:00.399
from the jewelry store.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.467
BOWMAN:
His cloud‐based

15:01.467 --> 15:04.106
data security firm
recently declared bankruptcy.

15:04.106 --> 15:05.375
He's up to his nostrils
in debt.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.612
Tech‐savvy and desperate.

15:06.612 --> 15:08.415
But why would Herb
pretend to be a customer

15:08.415 --> 15:09.518
in his own jewelry heist?

15:09.518 --> 15:11.789
Bowman, bring Herb in
for questioning.

15:11.789 --> 15:14.093
You and Riggs, go see
if anyone at the heist

15:14.093 --> 15:15.395
noticed anything
off about him.

15:15.395 --> 15:17.099
Why are you smiling?

15:17.099 --> 15:18.502
'Cause Riggs is gonna hate this.

15:19.571 --> 15:21.709
Oh, Marty,
glad you're here.

15:21.709 --> 15:24.146
You can help me fix
the pay‐per‐view.

15:24.146 --> 15:25.349
You can't order pay‐per‐view.

15:25.349 --> 15:26.618
Not without your help.

15:26.618 --> 15:28.421
(pressing remote buttons)
Oh, no.

15:28.421 --> 15:30.125
What the hell is all this?

15:30.125 --> 15:32.196
Just a few necessities.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.170
Three bags
of gourmet jelly beans?

15:36.170 --> 15:38.241
I have undiagnosed
low blood sugar.

15:39.644 --> 15:41.481
I... I'm not paying
for all of this.

15:41.481 --> 15:43.819
Honey, you need
to unclench.

15:43.819 --> 15:44.821
Relax.

15:44.821 --> 15:46.825
Put on a robe.

15:46.825 --> 15:48.194
We'll watch <i>Beaches.</i>

15:48.194 --> 15:49.631
(sighs)

15:49.631 --> 15:51.467
Okay. All right.

15:51.467 --> 15:54.841
The couple you saved
at the heist yesterday...

15:54.841 --> 15:57.747
See, it's stuck on the
hotel welcome channel.

15:57.747 --> 15:58.816
Hey! Hey.

15:58.816 --> 16:00.352
Hey.

16:00.352 --> 16:01.722
We think the husband's in on it.

16:01.722 --> 16:04.293
Did you notice anything unusual
about him today?

16:04.293 --> 16:06.164
Only that he
and that trophy wife

16:06.164 --> 16:07.567
hadn't schtupped
in at least a year.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.435
Trouble in paradise.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.704
What, they told you that?

16:09.704 --> 16:11.207
Intuition.

16:11.207 --> 16:13.311
I read people.

16:13.311 --> 16:14.514
Like you.

16:14.514 --> 16:16.852
Your eyes keep darting
over to the minibar.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.190
How many days sober?

16:19.190 --> 16:22.296
I'm guessing seven.

16:22.296 --> 16:24.634
Ten.
Woof.

16:24.634 --> 16:26.538
I've been there.

16:26.538 --> 16:30.345
So right now you're probably
feeling, like, a little foggy?

16:30.345 --> 16:32.382
Not quite yourself?

16:32.382 --> 16:33.719
I'm fine.
Yeah.

16:33.719 --> 16:35.556
Oh, honey, look at you.
You're not fine.

16:35.556 --> 16:37.760
(chuckles)
It's my look.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.764
Besides, I got a system.

16:39.764 --> 16:40.867
Ah.
Mm.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.169
A system?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.541
Let me guess.

16:44.541 --> 16:46.477
Pretend you got it
all under control

16:46.477 --> 16:49.416
and then blow off anyone
who tells you otherwise.

16:49.416 --> 16:50.853
I'm not doing this with you.

16:50.853 --> 16:53.926
And circle gets the square.

16:53.926 --> 16:55.530
Word of advice, kid,

16:55.530 --> 16:59.236
one drunk to another:
systems work.

16:59.236 --> 17:01.708
Until they don't.

17:03.879 --> 17:05.816
No more room service!

17:05.816 --> 17:08.388
What are we watching?

17:08.388 --> 17:09.323
Tom Cruise over here

17:09.323 --> 17:11.294
wants me to cut
together a video of him

17:11.294 --> 17:12.530
riding on the self‐driving car.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.300
Oh. Awesome. Can I see?

17:14.300 --> 17:15.903
MURTAUGH: No, because
not one police car

17:15.903 --> 17:17.306
caught it on their dash‐cam.

17:17.306 --> 17:18.776
SCORSESE: Hey.
For my generation,

17:18.776 --> 17:20.813
if it's not on film,
it never happened.

17:20.813 --> 17:22.684
Ah...

17:22.684 --> 17:24.821
So‐so when can we talk
to this Herb?

17:24.821 --> 17:25.923
He went AWOL.

17:25.923 --> 17:27.694
Yeah, have a
look at this.

17:27.694 --> 17:29.898
Herb just upped his wife's
life insurance policy.

17:29.898 --> 17:33.672
Hmm. So maybe the heist
was staged to off the wife,

17:33.672 --> 17:35.509
collect on the insurance policy.

17:35.509 --> 17:36.578
SCORSESE:
Make it look like

17:36.578 --> 17:37.747
a robbery gone bad.

17:37.747 --> 17:38.515
Very noir.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.285
BOWMAN:
But here's the kicker.

17:40.285 --> 17:42.289
The same anonymous account
that paid for the robbery

17:42.289 --> 17:43.892
just made another payment.

17:43.892 --> 17:45.663
So Herb just hired himself
another killer.

17:45.663 --> 17:46.598
Good job.

17:47.967 --> 17:51.207
To clarify: good job, Bowman.

17:51.207 --> 17:53.144
Huge disappointment, Scorsese.

17:54.614 --> 17:55.750
(siren wailing in distance)

17:55.750 --> 17:57.285
MURTAUGH:
There's the wife, Riggs.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.622
Be gentle.

18:00.358 --> 18:02.563
Mrs. Weiss?

18:02.563 --> 18:05.468
You're the detectives
from the jewelry store.

18:05.468 --> 18:07.172
Is there something wrong?

18:07.172 --> 18:09.778
We believe your husband's
trying to have you killed.

18:09.778 --> 18:12.884
Herb? No.
That's not possible.

18:12.884 --> 18:16.692
Yeah, well, between your
new life insurance policy

18:16.692 --> 18:18.327
and his financial
troubles...

18:18.327 --> 18:19.798
Financial troubles?

18:19.798 --> 18:21.868
Look, I'm sorry,
this sounds a little bit crazy.

18:21.868 --> 18:22.870
Rog, sniper!

18:26.277 --> 18:27.479
MURTAUGH:
Or just some kid.

18:31.688 --> 18:33.592
God, you just

18:33.592 --> 18:35.361
ripped my leggings.

18:35.361 --> 18:36.531
Uh...
What is wrong with you?

18:36.531 --> 18:38.000
Been a little off
lately, but...

18:38.000 --> 18:39.637
I could have sworn...
Oh!

18:39.637 --> 18:40.740
...somebody was trying
to kill you.
Well,

18:40.740 --> 18:42.008
next time
you have a thought,

18:42.008 --> 18:44.748
please
call our lawyer.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.785
Wait! Don't open that door!
(car alarm chirps)

18:46.785 --> 18:47.920
(device beeping)

19:00.478 --> 19:04.486
(car alarm blaring)

19:04.486 --> 19:05.956
I knew somebody
was trying to kill you.

19:05.956 --> 19:09.496
Please, tell me
someone got that on tape.

19:14.774 --> 19:16.678
$10 million?
He took out a $10 million

19:16.678 --> 19:18.515
life insurance policy on me?

19:18.515 --> 19:20.753
AVERY:
We'll find Herb
and whoever he hired

19:20.753 --> 19:22.824
to plant that bomb.
The whole department's looking,

19:22.824 --> 19:24.894
but do you know
where we could find him?

19:24.894 --> 19:26.096
I'm sorry, I don't.

19:26.096 --> 19:28.535
And he never told you about
the insurance or bankruptcy?

19:30.673 --> 19:33.211
He didn't like me
to ask about that stuff.

19:34.914 --> 19:37.753
God, I feel so stupid.
GREG: Mrs. Weiss, I came

19:37.753 --> 19:39.389
as soon as I got the call.
Greg Antonetti.

19:39.389 --> 19:40.491
I'm the Weiss family's attorney.

19:40.491 --> 19:42.429
I was hoping that

19:42.429 --> 19:44.567
Herb told Greg
more than he told me.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.337
Do you know
where we could find him?

19:46.337 --> 19:47.607
ALI:
Greg,

19:47.607 --> 19:49.577
the bastard just tried
to blow up my car.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.386
There's a condo

19:54.386 --> 19:56.090
in Camarillo.

19:56.090 --> 19:57.727
He used it for, um...

19:57.727 --> 19:59.029
ALI:
For other women.

19:59.029 --> 19:59.964
Of course.

19:59.964 --> 20:01.968
AVERY: I'll send a squad
car to the condo.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.741
But in the meantime, you should
remain in protective custody.

20:04.741 --> 20:06.645
MURTAUGH:
I know a great hotel.

20:06.645 --> 20:08.047
You'll love it.

20:08.047 --> 20:09.416
Heated pool.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.653
RUTHIE:
<i>This is prejudice.</i>

20:10.653 --> 20:12.690
Ageist, sexist.

20:12.690 --> 20:13.859
Yeah, tell me something, sir.

20:13.859 --> 20:15.996
How do you
sleep at night?

20:15.996 --> 20:18.067
Mr. Riggs? Finally.

20:18.067 --> 20:19.637
What's going on here?

20:19.637 --> 20:21.574
I'm being
unlawfully evicted.

20:21.574 --> 20:24.547
We caught her skinny‐dipping
in the lanai pool.

20:24.547 --> 20:26.618
It was empty.

20:26.618 --> 20:28.087
We've asked her
to vacate the premises.

20:28.087 --> 20:29.389
But she's refusing.

20:29.389 --> 20:30.559
I know my rights,
trust me.

20:30.559 --> 20:33.164
I've been to bed with at least
two Supreme Court justices.

20:33.164 --> 20:34.466
Stop talking.

20:34.466 --> 20:35.536
Could you guys

20:35.536 --> 20:37.105
excuse us
for just a few minutes?

20:37.105 --> 20:38.709
Ah.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.589
What the hell were you thinking?

20:45.589 --> 20:46.825
I wasn't.

20:46.825 --> 20:48.729
That's the whole point
of skinny‐dipping.

20:48.729 --> 20:51.534
Just floating free,

20:51.534 --> 20:53.605
naked as the day God made you.

20:53.605 --> 20:55.909
All that baggage
weighing you down

20:55.909 --> 20:57.713
doesn't feel so heavy.

20:57.713 --> 20:59.751
Y‐You should try it.

20:59.751 --> 21:02.623
Pack it up 'cause
you're out of here.

21:02.623 --> 21:04.493
RV's not ready till tomorrow.

21:04.493 --> 21:05.696
Where we going?

21:05.696 --> 21:08.635
Oh, we're not going anywhere.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.004
I'm going home.

21:10.004 --> 21:12.108
Bye.
Oh...

21:12.108 --> 21:13.144
I see.
(door opens)

21:13.144 --> 21:14.279
Well, you know,

21:14.279 --> 21:16.751
the streets should be friendly
to an old lady like me.

21:16.751 --> 21:19.857
I took a Tae Bo class
in '96, yeah.

21:19.857 --> 21:22.596
I'm... I'm sure
I'll be fine.

21:22.596 --> 21:24.700
(TV chirping)

21:29.744 --> 21:31.681
DEREK:
Who wants to see a dunk?

21:31.681 --> 21:32.917
I do!
Huh?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.086
CHILDREN:
One more time!

21:34.086 --> 21:35.889
(whooping, cheering)

21:35.889 --> 21:40.098
You know, anyone can dunk
in a bounce house.

21:40.098 --> 21:44.907
I sunk a bomb into a
Dumpster in one shot.

21:44.907 --> 21:46.477
And that was
just yesterday.

21:46.477 --> 21:48.782
TRISH:
Roger, enough.

21:48.782 --> 21:51.019
I don't like all this
risky behavior.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.122
And what does it prove, honey?

21:52.122 --> 21:54.994
That I'm not a grandpa
stuck in a tube.

21:54.994 --> 21:57.933
Well, you know what,
I prefer a grandpa in a tube

21:57.933 --> 22:00.204
than a husband
in a hospital.

22:00.204 --> 22:04.547
CHILDREN:
Derek! Derek! Derek! Derek!

22:04.547 --> 22:06.718
Roger, don't even
think it‐‐ stop.

22:06.718 --> 22:07.853
Whatever it is,
stop it.

22:07.853 --> 22:11.126
Can't a guy bounce
in a house

22:11.126 --> 22:12.763
to impress his daughter?

22:12.763 --> 22:14.466
This is silly.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.969
(cheering)

22:15.969 --> 22:17.907
CHILDREN:
One more!

22:17.907 --> 22:21.180
One more! One more! One more!

22:21.180 --> 22:22.583
Roger.

22:22.583 --> 22:24.486
Back on the horse.

22:24.486 --> 22:25.923
Good for you, you know?

22:25.923 --> 22:28.060
Enough talk, Derek.

22:28.060 --> 22:30.031
Pass the rock.

22:30.031 --> 22:32.503
(ball squeaks)
All right, kids,

22:32.503 --> 22:34.807
pay attention.

22:34.807 --> 22:38.214
Now, this is a take
on the Dee Brown

22:38.214 --> 22:40.051
no‐look one‐hander

22:40.051 --> 22:43.658
from the '91
Slam Dunk Contest.

22:43.658 --> 22:45.529
Are you ready?

22:45.529 --> 22:46.731
Here we go.

22:51.641 --> 22:52.843
(loud pop, air hissing)

22:52.843 --> 22:54.680
(kids screaming)

22:54.680 --> 22:56.784
DEREK:
Oh, my God, hey, the kids!

22:56.784 --> 22:58.855
Uh‐oh.
Hey, hey.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.293
Oh.
(screaming)

23:01.293 --> 23:03.965
(overlapping chatter)

23:03.965 --> 23:06.069
TRISH:
Derek, you got 'em?

23:07.573 --> 23:09.543
Here you go, easy, easy.

23:09.543 --> 23:10.712
Careful, careful
on your way out.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.752
You kids all right?
(applause)

23:13.752 --> 23:15.254
Roger?

23:15.254 --> 23:17.258
(ball squeaks)

23:17.258 --> 23:19.129
(air hissing)

23:21.801 --> 23:23.638
MAN:
What are you thinking, buddy?

23:23.638 --> 23:26.778
You see?
Now, that's how we do it.

23:26.778 --> 23:28.013
(ball squeaks)

23:31.788 --> 23:33.825
(door opens)

23:33.825 --> 23:37.265
Ooh. Whoa.

23:37.265 --> 23:40.037
Not bad.

23:40.037 --> 23:43.010
I spent three ecstatic months
with Gregg Allman

23:43.010 --> 23:45.181
in a spot just like it.

23:45.181 --> 23:46.116
All right.

23:46.116 --> 23:49.857
You can have the couch,
I'll take a chair.

23:49.857 --> 23:51.326
I do sleep <i>au buffo.</i>

23:51.326 --> 23:53.732
The chair outside.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.267
Wow.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.873
Ten days and he tumbles
off the wagon.

23:57.873 --> 24:00.077
No, no, no, those
are not for drinking,

24:00.077 --> 24:01.079
they're for shooting.

24:01.079 --> 24:03.685
Oh? Why is this one open?

24:03.685 --> 24:05.287
'Cause you ruined
my system.

24:05.287 --> 24:06.156
Uh, me?
Mm.

24:06.156 --> 24:08.327
All I said was
it wouldn't work forever,

24:08.327 --> 24:09.697
and it didn't.

24:09.697 --> 24:11.299
(sighs)

24:11.299 --> 24:13.571
'Cause you know
everything, right?

24:13.571 --> 24:15.107
No, I‐I know enough.

24:15.107 --> 24:16.076
Mm.

24:16.076 --> 24:18.113
Well, I know why you got
cuts on your fingers.

24:18.113 --> 24:20.819
What's your poison?
Razors?

24:20.819 --> 24:22.623
Office supplies.

24:22.623 --> 24:24.225
Classy.

24:24.225 --> 24:27.800
I was a stovetop girl myself.
Still got the callouses.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.937
Sounds painful.
Yeah.

24:29.937 --> 24:32.709
Isn't that the point?

24:32.709 --> 24:35.682
Honey, I'm not judging.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.051
Do what you gotta do.

24:37.051 --> 24:39.957
Drink, slice your fingers,
shoot bottles.

24:39.957 --> 24:41.026
Make yourself hurt

24:41.026 --> 24:44.834
so you don't have
to hurt inside.

24:44.834 --> 24:47.104
But sooner or later, Marty,

24:47.104 --> 24:50.044
that's the hurt that gets you.

24:52.248 --> 24:53.217
It's late.

24:53.217 --> 24:55.856
I'm gonna go crash.
Good.

24:55.856 --> 24:57.693
Take this with you.

24:57.693 --> 25:00.164
(bottles rattling)

25:00.164 --> 25:01.801
What am I supposed
to do with this?

25:01.801 --> 25:04.607
Dress each one up
like a different president.

25:04.607 --> 25:07.646
What do I care? I can't
have it in the house.

25:07.646 --> 25:08.848
(sighs)

25:08.848 --> 25:10.384
And get some sleep, Marty.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.854
You look like crap.

25:22.943 --> 25:25.849
(man shouting indistinctly)

25:25.849 --> 25:28.120
(bottles rattling)

25:43.350 --> 25:45.287
(clinking)

26:08.166 --> 26:10.905
Don't look at me
like that.

26:10.905 --> 26:11.807
I'm a grown man.

26:11.807 --> 26:13.645
If I want a drink,
I can have a drink.

26:15.314 --> 26:17.284
Look, it's not
even for me.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.057
All right? This is for
the people of Los Angeles.

26:20.057 --> 26:22.061
I've lost my edge,
so this is mandatory.

26:22.061 --> 26:23.397
Understand.

26:26.469 --> 26:27.338
So, what should I do?

26:27.338 --> 26:29.075
Should I‐‐ should
I put my sobriety

26:29.075 --> 26:30.477
over the safety
of the public?

26:30.477 --> 26:32.481
Yeah? All right, fine.

26:32.481 --> 26:35.087
Fine.

26:35.087 --> 26:36.891
There it is.

26:36.891 --> 26:37.959
If something bad happens today,

26:37.959 --> 26:39.228
I just want you to know
it's on you.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.736
All right?

26:43.805 --> 26:45.809
(truck door opens and closes)

26:45.809 --> 26:47.144
(engine starts)

26:49.148 --> 26:51.186
Time for a swim.

26:53.123 --> 26:55.127
Eyes open, boys.

26:55.127 --> 26:57.398
You're gonna want to see this.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.233
MAN:
Ow!

26:58.233 --> 27:00.370
MURTAUGH (sneering):
<i>Firemen.</i>

27:00.370 --> 27:03.076
Always want to be
the big hero.

27:03.076 --> 27:05.013
You see how he
dove back in

27:05.013 --> 27:06.216
to save the kids?

27:06.216 --> 27:08.721
Those kids were
literally suffocating

27:08.721 --> 27:09.556
in that bounce house.

27:09.556 --> 27:12.094
I had it under
control, all right?

27:12.094 --> 27:15.200
But, no, Derek wanted
all the glory.

27:15.200 --> 27:20.010
Did Derek make you dunk
on a child‐size hoop?

27:20.010 --> 27:23.518
Did Derek make you jump
on a driverless car?

27:23.518 --> 27:24.218
Indirectly.

27:24.218 --> 27:28.460
Oh, my gosh.
Baby, look at me.

27:30.765 --> 27:33.370
Look at me.
(sighs)

27:33.370 --> 27:35.942
I know you don't like
feeling old,

27:35.942 --> 27:38.280
but this is not how
you deal with it.

27:41.452 --> 27:44.292
It's not like anyone got hurt.
No, gosh.
Not yet, Roger.

27:44.292 --> 27:47.431
But if you keep taking these
unnecessary risks, you will.

27:47.431 --> 27:51.105
I'm not doing anything
that Riggs doesn't do

27:51.105 --> 27:52.341
almost on a daily.

27:52.341 --> 27:54.913
Riggs does not have
a family that relies on him.

27:54.913 --> 27:58.921
Yeah, well, I didn't do
anything I can't handle.

27:58.921 --> 28:00.892
Okay, Roger, enough.

28:00.892 --> 28:02.796
Listen to yourself.

28:02.796 --> 28:04.465
You are using Riggs

28:04.465 --> 28:07.371
as a template
for normal behavior.

28:11.412 --> 28:14.151
Oh, my God,
you might be right.

28:15.521 --> 28:19.863
Baby, don't let your pride
take you away from this family.

28:19.863 --> 28:23.303
Promise me
you'll let it go.

28:27.177 --> 28:29.448
You look
how I feel, Bowman.

28:29.448 --> 28:30.685
(groans)

28:30.685 --> 28:34.091
I did something bad, and I'm
ready to face the consequences.

28:34.091 --> 28:36.095
Like "murder" bad,
or bad like you ate

28:36.095 --> 28:37.398
Avery's lunch
by accident?

28:37.398 --> 28:40.337
Look, I've been up all night
on the Dark Web

28:40.337 --> 28:43.209
trying to track the hits
Herb ordered on his wife.

28:43.209 --> 28:45.414
Somehow I ended up in a...

28:45.414 --> 28:47.017
terrifying Russian chat room,

28:47.017 --> 28:51.092
and‐and...
I hired someone.

28:54.633 --> 28:55.367
What's her name?

28:55.367 --> 28:58.039
What? No, no, no,
no, no, I...

28:58.039 --> 28:59.977
No, I paid someone
to hack into

28:59.977 --> 29:01.580
the LTE hot spot in Herb's car

29:01.580 --> 29:04.185
and record off his
hands‐free mic.

29:04.185 --> 29:05.822
I just thought it would
help us find him.

29:08.026 --> 29:10.197
And that's what
you're worried about?

29:10.197 --> 29:11.366
I did, like,
seven illegal things

29:11.366 --> 29:14.205
before I got here
this morning.
Really?

29:14.205 --> 29:15.440
All right, what do we got?
(clears throat)

29:15.440 --> 29:16.910
I had Vasily make a tape,

29:16.910 --> 29:18.914
and you need to see this.

29:18.914 --> 29:20.384
HERB (on computer): Please,
just tell me who hired you, man.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.419
I'll give you whatever you want.

29:21.419 --> 29:22.321
BOWMAN:
That's Herb.

29:22.321 --> 29:24.526
MAN:
Shut up and drive.
Who's that?

29:24.526 --> 29:26.295
No idea.
HERB: I will, I will.

29:26.295 --> 29:28.868
Just, please, just leave
my wife out of it‐‐ please.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.172
(gunshot)

29:31.172 --> 29:32.876
MAN:
Next one's not a warning.

29:32.876 --> 29:34.546
Drive!

29:34.546 --> 29:36.149
So, Herb's not trying
to kill Ali.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.652
Someone's going after them both.

29:37.652 --> 29:42.061
Tell Rog to meet me
at the hotel.

29:42.061 --> 29:43.296
(knock on door)

29:43.296 --> 29:44.966
Can I help you?
ALI: It's okay.

29:46.537 --> 29:48.406
Greg, what are you
doing here?

29:48.406 --> 29:50.912
I have something for you.

29:50.912 --> 29:52.247
Your prenup.

29:52.247 --> 29:54.318
I thought you might
want to look it over bef...

29:54.318 --> 29:55.922
(silenced gunshots)
(gasping)

29:59.195 --> 30:00.898
(elevator bell chimes)

30:10.217 --> 30:11.587
RIGGS:
Ali?

30:28.019 --> 30:29.689
We're too late.

30:31.259 --> 30:32.361
Damn it.

30:34.131 --> 30:36.703
Hey, it's not your fault.

30:36.703 --> 30:39.543
I'm gonna fix this
once and for all.

30:47.625 --> 30:50.631
What the hell you looking at?

30:57.477 --> 30:59.348
So, someone hired bad guys
off the Dark Web

30:59.348 --> 31:01.319
to kidnap Herb and Ali.

31:01.319 --> 31:04.258
We don't know who,
why, or where.

31:04.258 --> 31:07.130
Certainly not
our best work.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.132
Hey.

31:08.132 --> 31:10.671
You okay?

31:10.671 --> 31:12.307
Never better.
Yeah, well, that bottle's

31:12.307 --> 31:13.644
gonna make an awful
small target.

31:13.644 --> 31:15.648
Who said anything
about shooting it?

31:15.648 --> 31:19.689
Hey. So, the good news is
I got the private GPS data

31:19.689 --> 31:21.092
off Herb's car.

31:21.092 --> 31:22.060
Okay, and what's the bad news?

31:22.060 --> 31:23.664
I may have committed
just a touch of treason.

31:23.664 --> 31:26.168
All right,
where are they now?

31:26.168 --> 31:28.339
A hunting cabin.
Angeles Forest.

31:32.347 --> 31:33.751
(muffled pleas)

31:37.457 --> 31:39.061
(lighter clinks open)

31:39.061 --> 31:40.263
Hey!

31:40.263 --> 31:42.334
Hey!

31:42.334 --> 31:43.436
Are you crazy?

31:43.436 --> 31:44.773
Hey, listen, Tiny.

31:44.773 --> 31:46.576
How about you do your job
and I do mine, eh?

31:48.847 --> 31:51.085
(vehicle approaching)

31:51.085 --> 31:53.122
What's that?

31:57.230 --> 31:58.734
Mr. Bell‐bottoms?

31:58.734 --> 32:00.638
Hey, kid,
get out of here.

32:00.638 --> 32:01.707
I'm looking for my cat.

32:01.707 --> 32:02.775
Well, go look somewhere else.

32:02.775 --> 32:06.650
ALI:
Help! Somebody please help!

32:07.752 --> 32:09.723
Help me, please!

32:18.640 --> 32:20.110
What the hell am I
stepping in?

32:20.110 --> 32:21.780
Smells like gasoline.

32:21.780 --> 32:24.485
And lots of it.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.654
I'm gonna take upstairs.

32:32.568 --> 32:35.140
(cat meowing)

32:36.308 --> 32:37.411
Shh, quiet.

32:37.411 --> 32:38.446
(cat meows)

32:38.446 --> 32:39.481
Shh.

32:39.481 --> 32:42.688
(muffled yelling)

32:42.688 --> 32:45.393
(muffled):
Oh, God.

32:45.393 --> 32:47.297
All right. All right.

32:47.297 --> 32:49.836
I‐I thought he was
gonna kill me.

32:49.836 --> 32:52.441
Ah.

32:55.146 --> 32:56.282
How'd you yell for help?

32:56.282 --> 32:57.284
Well, the gag was loose.

32:57.284 --> 32:58.620
Can you please untie me?

32:58.620 --> 33:00.691
Who tied you up?

33:00.691 --> 33:02.227
Herb, my husband.

33:02.227 --> 33:04.231
Mm, wrong answer.

33:04.231 --> 33:05.433
Herb was kidnapped.

33:05.433 --> 33:07.204
You know,

33:07.204 --> 33:08.540
the bruises are a nice touch.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.711
Very convincing.
So, was it

33:10.711 --> 33:12.815
for the life insurance
or because you hated him?

33:12.815 --> 33:13.483
Can it be both?

33:13.483 --> 33:16.088
Ah. That is good.
(yells)

33:17.157 --> 33:19.127
(grunting)

33:20.263 --> 33:22.200
(groans, grunts)

33:22.200 --> 33:23.704

MURTAUGH (whispering):
Quiet.

33:23.704 --> 33:25.473
Bad kitty.

34:51.546 --> 34:55.286

34:55.286 --> 34:57.958
That's not gasoline.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.637
Oh, that's not good.

35:07.210 --> 35:09.281
(muffled yelling)

35:10.551 --> 35:11.853
Herb.

35:11.853 --> 35:13.255
We got to get out of here.

35:14.458 --> 35:15.594
(gunshot)

35:19.969 --> 35:22.575
You know, you might want
to try and lose some weight.

35:22.575 --> 35:25.581
Okay. Let's...
get out of here.
(grunting)

35:25.581 --> 35:27.618
Clear the area.
The place might blow.

BOY:
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

35:41.713 --> 35:42.748
Did you see
my cat in there?

35:42.748 --> 35:44.786
Yeah, and he almost
got me shot.

35:44.786 --> 35:46.656
Hey, hey, hey.

35:46.656 --> 35:48.527
Where are you going?
You can't go in there.

35:48.527 --> 35:50.396
But I have to get
Mr. Bell‐bottoms.
Look, kid, do you know

35:50.396 --> 35:52.500
how dangerous it is
to run into a building

35:52.500 --> 35:54.271
that's filled with
gasoline and propane?

35:59.381 --> 36:00.951
You got a phone?

36:00.951 --> 36:03.422
(coughs)

36:03.422 --> 36:05.459
Here, kitty, kitty.

36:05.459 --> 36:07.330
I don't even like cats.

36:07.330 --> 36:08.567
(meows)
Hey.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.637
Hey, buddy, come here.

36:10.637 --> 36:13.643
(glass tinkles)

36:18.653 --> 36:19.922
Son of a...

36:24.431 --> 36:26.368
(distorted yelling)

36:40.697 --> 36:42.568
Ooh!

36:42.568 --> 36:44.805
Kid, tell me you got that
on tape.

36:44.805 --> 36:47.611
(laughs)
I want to see some

36:47.611 --> 36:49.815
grandpa do that.
(laughs)

36:55.059 --> 36:57.130
Roger, I saw the video.
Dude, you looked badass.

36:57.130 --> 36:58.700
(chuckles)
That's what I'm talking about.

36:58.700 --> 36:59.702
(laughing):
Oh, yes.

36:59.702 --> 37:01.371
We just hit 500 views.

37:01.371 --> 37:03.777
Oh, yeah.
Doubt me now, Scorsese?

37:03.777 --> 37:05.647
So, okay,

37:05.647 --> 37:07.317
where was I?

37:07.317 --> 37:08.553
The‐the hit man just
pulled out the lighter.

37:08.553 --> 37:09.789
I love this part.

37:09.789 --> 37:10.624
Right, so there I was,

37:10.624 --> 37:13.596
air thick with propane
and danger,

37:13.596 --> 37:15.567
the cabin was
about to explode,

37:15.567 --> 37:19.809
but Mr. Bell‐bottoms was
counting on me to save him.

37:19.809 --> 37:21.411
So I scooped him up in my arms.

37:21.411 --> 37:23.516
I made peace with death

37:23.516 --> 37:25.520
and then I jump.

37:25.520 --> 37:29.094
Now, would a lesser man
have taken the door?

37:29.094 --> 37:34.538
Maybe. But Roger Mayfield
Murtaugh never walks

37:34.538 --> 37:36.108
when he can fly.

37:36.108 --> 37:37.443
(laughter)

37:37.443 --> 37:39.648
Roger Mayfield Murtaugh

37:39.648 --> 37:42.855
may never walk again.

37:42.855 --> 37:43.857
Oh, hey, baby.

37:43.857 --> 37:46.729
Um, so‐so, how much of that

37:46.729 --> 37:47.931
did you hear?

37:47.931 --> 37:51.071
Enough to know that you chose
to put yourself in danger

37:51.071 --> 37:53.810
after you promised me
you wouldn't.

37:53.810 --> 37:56.883
Well, it really wasn't
that dangerous.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.920
And, besides,
it's just

37:58.920 --> 38:00.557
a hairline fracture.

38:00.557 --> 38:02.995
Well, I hope you can
get yourself home.

38:02.995 --> 38:04.732
Oh, come on.

38:04.732 --> 38:06.836
Trish, hey.
Let me explain.

38:11.746 --> 38:13.115
Here for the free
bear claws?

38:13.115 --> 38:15.854
Damn, I only saw the crullers.

38:15.854 --> 38:17.758
Oh, here.

38:17.758 --> 38:19.862
Final invoice for my RV.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.632
I told the mechanic I was dying.

38:21.632 --> 38:22.668
He gave me a discount.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.505
Well, I appreciate that.

38:24.505 --> 38:25.907
Don't mention it.

38:25.907 --> 38:27.578
Hell of a piece you got there.

38:27.578 --> 38:29.915
Oh, thank you very much.

38:29.915 --> 38:32.855
I just took it for a spin

38:32.855 --> 38:35.727
and got my edge back.

38:35.727 --> 38:38.533
And I didn't even have a drink.

38:38.533 --> 38:39.835
Looks like I'm fixed.

38:39.835 --> 38:42.373
(chuckles)
Sure you are, hon.

38:44.077 --> 38:47.684
No, I'm not letting you
ruin this.

38:47.684 --> 38:49.822
Listen, fine, hey.

38:49.822 --> 38:51.626
Hey, hey, hey.

38:51.626 --> 38:53.863
Fine. What?

38:53.863 --> 38:56.569
You had a good day.

38:56.569 --> 38:57.470
I'm happy for you.

38:57.470 --> 39:00.510
But until you let go
of everything else,

39:00.510 --> 39:03.550
of all that pain
you're holding onto,

39:03.550 --> 39:05.186
you'll never be free.

39:05.186 --> 39:06.622
I'm plenty free.

39:06.622 --> 39:10.564
Mm, trust me. You're not.

39:10.564 --> 39:12.935
Lady, I live in a trailer
at the beach. Come on.

39:12.935 --> 39:15.840
And still, not free.

39:17.644 --> 39:20.216
But I hope some day you are.

39:20.216 --> 39:22.588
Adios, Marty.

39:22.588 --> 39:23.756
See you when I see you.

39:23.756 --> 39:25.860
(elevator bell chimes)

39:40.189 --> 39:42.426
I was half expecting flowers.

39:44.130 --> 39:46.134
I thought about it.

39:46.134 --> 39:49.007
But, uh, I wanted to be honest.

39:49.007 --> 39:52.648
So this isn't an apology.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.125
Trish...

39:58.125 --> 40:01.164
for the first time
in a very long time,

40:01.164 --> 40:03.168
I've felt young again.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.672
Alive.

40:04.672 --> 40:07.911
And I don't feel that
I need to apologize for that.

40:07.911 --> 40:10.049
So, you don't feel alive
when you're at home?

40:10.049 --> 40:12.654
That's not fair.
You know what's
not fair, Roger?

40:12.654 --> 40:16.061
You running into a building
that's about to explode!

40:16.061 --> 40:17.063
That's not fair.

40:17.063 --> 40:18.966
You know I love this family
more than anything.

40:18.966 --> 40:21.171
Then stop risking it, Roger.
How?

40:21.171 --> 40:23.175
You want me to retire?
Get a desk job?

40:23.175 --> 40:24.912
Oh, so now we're gonna
blame the job?

40:24.912 --> 40:27.350
I have been married
to a cop for 20 years.

40:27.350 --> 40:29.287
This isn't the job.
This is you.

40:29.287 --> 40:31.124
You making danger
for yourself.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.028
You don't know what it's
like out in the field.

40:33.028 --> 40:34.297
What about here?

40:34.297 --> 40:36.836
Hmm?

40:36.836 --> 40:40.242
When I got that call that
you were in the hospital,

40:40.242 --> 40:44.250
Roger, I was right back there
in that night...

40:44.250 --> 40:46.889
Yeah. Two years ago.
...two years ago

40:46.889 --> 40:49.327
when I almost lost you.

40:54.738 --> 40:57.677
I need you to tell me

40:57.677 --> 41:01.050
that this reckless behavior
will end.

41:04.223 --> 41:05.660
I can't.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.031
(scoffs)

41:08.031 --> 41:11.004
Okay.

41:11.004 --> 41:14.110
Then, until you can,

41:14.110 --> 41:15.780
you can sleep on the couch.

41:19.120 --> 41:21.191
Come on, Trish.
Is this what you really want?

41:23.161 --> 41:25.365
If I have to learn
to live without you,

41:25.365 --> 41:28.773
I might as well
start practicing now.

41:33.983 --> 41:35.820
All right.

41:35.820 --> 41:37.657
But you be careful
what you wish for.

to that whole, uh,

42:36.341 --> 42:37.911
"I'll see you when I see you."
What happened to that?

42:37.911 --> 42:39.013
And I'm seeing you.

42:39.013 --> 42:41.117
What are you doing here?

42:41.117 --> 42:41.952
Well, like I said,

42:41.952 --> 42:44.825
home is where you
park it, honey.

42:44.825 --> 42:46.260
Got to park somewhere.

42:46.260 --> 42:48.264
No, no, no,
you're not parking that here.

42:48.264 --> 42:50.937
Let me just slip out
of my dungarees.

42:50.937 --> 42:51.939
I'll come join you.

42:51.939 --> 42:53.743
Nope, I changed my mind.

42:53.743 --> 42:55.713
I'm going inside.

42:57.917 --> 43:00.155
Night, Marty!

43:00.155 --> 43:02.292
RIGGS:
Good night, Ruthie!
