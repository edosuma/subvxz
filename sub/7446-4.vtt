00:12.260 --> 00:13.980
I got runners all over the streets.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.500
There's a battle on
about who they work for.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.300
Can't any of you kids
bring this shit under control?!

00:19.300 --> 00:21.540
You help us get rid of the competition.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.100
You gotta pay well for hard work.

you gonna do this, Trev?

00:28.940 --> 00:31.460
You don't get money like this

NARRATOR: John Ibrahim
came to King's Cross to build an empire.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.218
Kim Hollingsworth came
on a voyage of self-discovery.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.420
The Cross attracts all kinds of people,

Nah. Becky reckons rooting
in hotels is sluttish.

Huh? Come on, brother.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.420
I was asking you nicely, mate.
Piss off.

Oh, yeah? Yeah?

03:24.740 --> 03:27.380
So you work for Steve Hardas

03:27.380 --> 03:29.100
That's right.

03:29.100 --> 03:33.252
But the fella you went to help
works for Bill Bayeh.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.420
You know Bill Bayeh?

03:37.420 --> 03:39.660
Who doesn't?

03:39.660 --> 03:43.700
See, I spoke to Bill's boys
and they reckon you did the right thing,

03:43.700 --> 03:46.740
you know, by helping out.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.900
Problem is uniform's
taken two statements here

03:49.900 --> 03:52.660
which says something
completely different.

03:52.660 --> 03:58.257
So, mate, I'm gonna have to
charge you... aggravated assault.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.420
Mind you, the witnesses
are a couple of shitbags.

04:03.420 --> 04:07.020
I could give them a call,
have a little word with them.

04:07.020 --> 04:10.899
Bit of luck, they might not
even turn up to court.

04:13.060 --> 04:17.815
No, no, no, no.
Put it away, son. Put it away.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.296

NARRATOR: Some are born great,
others achieve greatness,

04:28.940 --> 04:31.060
and some
have greatness thrust upon them.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.340
You could say the same thing
about drug dealers.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.780
In the early '90s,
Bill Bayeh was doing it pretty tough.

04:38.780 --> 04:41.900
But then things took
a sudden turn for the better

04:41.900 --> 04:44.300
with a green light
from Detective Sergeant Trevor Haken,

04:44.300 --> 04:48.740
who conveniently put all Bill's
major competition out of business.

04:48.740 --> 04:52.335
He now had the King's Cross
drug market all to himself.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.180
Evening, boys.
Mr Bayeh.

04:55.180 --> 04:57.900
How are you?
Pretty good. How are you?

04:57.900 --> 04:59.700
Evening, Mr Bayeh.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.260
I hear you copped some trouble.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.740
Oh, no worries, Mr Bayeh.
Just helping out.

05:03.740 --> 05:06.300

05:06.300 --> 05:09.780
Yeah. Yeah, he did. Thanks, Mr Bayeh.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.180
So where are your people from, boy?

05:12.180 --> 05:13.820
Bekaa, up north.

05:13.820 --> 05:15.860
Later I'm gonna need a lift.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.220
You got a car?

05:17.220 --> 05:20.180
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.136
I'll see you later, then, huh?

BENNY: I'm sorry, Mr Bayeh,
the passenger door, it's fucked.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.940
I've been a bit short money-wise so...

05:30.940 --> 05:35.456
How many door do you need?
One door plenty.

(ENGINE REVS)

05:46.260 --> 05:48.780
You carry this, huh?

05:48.780 --> 05:51.340
Yeah. No dramas.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.700
NARRATOR: Bill Bayeh's problem was
that he was strictly a short-term thinker.

05:58.700 --> 06:02.060
Because he was a chronic gambler
he was always cash-strapped,

06:02.060 --> 06:04.180
which meant that he could only afford

06:04.180 --> 06:06.460
to buy an ounce or two
of cocaine at a time.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.860
A few days later he'd be back
knocking on the same door,

06:08.860 --> 06:10.612
asking for another ounce.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.580
But nobody ever said Bill was dumb.

06:15.580 --> 06:19.100
To disguise the traffic
and minimise the risk

06:19.100 --> 06:23.651
he persuaded naive kids from
the suburbs to do the legwork for him.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.660
BENNY: Mr Bayeh, this piece of shit.

06:28.660 --> 06:30.500
I'm ashamed, you know?
Hey. Don't say sorry.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.340
It doesn't matter where you start, boy.

06:33.340 --> 06:36.650
Important thing... where you finish.

06:40.740 --> 06:44.300
Mate of mine got an ounce,
doubled his money in a weekend.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.620
It's four grand for an ounce, Norm.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.180
I've got a grand.
Yeah.

06:48.180 --> 06:49.780
Your dad's gonna lend you cash.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.300
What? You want me to spend
my dad's money on coke?

06:52.300 --> 06:55.740
You move the gear, you make money,
you pay him back double.

06:55.740 --> 06:59.210
No, no, no. We cut in on Billy,
he'll go mental, alright?

07:00.260 --> 07:02.020
You know what you are?
No, what?

07:02.020 --> 07:03.500
You're Billy's fall guy.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.140
Yeah.
He's playing you.

07:05.140 --> 07:09.140
You carry the cash,
you carry the gear, you drive him around.

07:09.140 --> 07:10.732
There's trouble...

07:14.700 --> 07:16.180
(BELL RINGS)

07:16.180 --> 07:19.297
I left my wallet at home.

07:21.420 --> 07:26.448
Hey, bro, we should set up
our own little shop. No more fall guy.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.580
You should have seen him.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.060
(SIREN WAILS)
It was so gross.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.060
Shit.
Oh, my God.

07:33.060 --> 07:36.177
Just let me talk to him, alright?
Can I see your ID, madam?

07:39.060 --> 07:41.100
I don't think I've got any.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.580
Well, then, I'll have to ask you

07:42.580 --> 07:45.219
to get inside the vehicle
so I can do a full body search.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.700
Go on.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.180
Whoo-hoo.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.171
Love you.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.540
Why, hello.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.020
You sure this is alright,
me riding in your car?

08:03.020 --> 08:05.060
Sure. Who's gonna stop us?

08:05.060 --> 08:06.620
It's Dooley. Get down.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.260
Is he your Sergeant?

08:09.260 --> 08:11.171
No, he's just trouble.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.740
I don't think he twigged there was...
(UNZIPPING)

08:14.740 --> 08:16.660
Jesus.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.340
Just keep your eyes on the road.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.729
Yeah.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.659
Yeah, so uniforms picked up
this chick last night

08:33.659 --> 08:35.900
for a drink driving charge,

08:35.900 --> 08:38.980
and in the spirit of old mateship

08:38.980 --> 08:40.820
I thought I might give you the heads-up.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.059
Why? Who was she?

08:42.059 --> 08:43.618
Susie Wallis.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.780
As in the daughter of Ken Wallis.

08:46.780 --> 08:49.020
As in 'Big Daddy' Wallis,
the Premier's best mate in cabinet?

08:49.020 --> 08:50.700
Big Daddy Wallis, that's right.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.860
The one who chooses the commissioner,
appoints the judges,

08:53.860 --> 08:55.940
and shafts anyone he doesn't like.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.180
Great guy to know.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.660
Very handy contact to have
if approached in the right way.

08:59.660 --> 09:01.300

You know me, eh, Den?
Always good for a shout.

09:10.260 --> 09:11.260
Yeah.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.740
I'll be with you in a sec, mate.

09:12.740 --> 09:14.820
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.129
(SIGHS)

09:18.460 --> 09:21.380
So, er, who's the charging officer?

09:21.380 --> 09:25.460
Joe Dooley. Good guy.
Straight. Hard. Have a read.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.018
I'll talk to you in a second.

09:30.180 --> 09:33.060
Hey, Jim, everything alright?

09:33.060 --> 09:34.652
Yeah, sweet.

09:41.260 --> 09:44.058
Thanks for coming by.
Let's go get a coffee.

09:46.940 --> 09:49.340
I just wanted to have a chat with you

09:49.340 --> 09:51.740
about that girl you picked up
for drink driving the other night.

09:51.740 --> 09:54.980
Problem?
No, far from it.

09:54.980 --> 09:57.100
But Susie Wallis is the daughter

09:57.100 --> 09:59.620
of a rather influential
member of State Cabinet.

09:59.620 --> 10:01.580
Ken Wallis.
Correct.

10:01.580 --> 10:06.300
And because of that...
Well, you know how the world works.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.780
You might find yourself
being approached about it.

10:09.780 --> 10:13.409
(CHUCKLES) I'd wondered about that.

10:14.460 --> 10:17.140
Now, I'm not implying which quarters
these approaches might come from,

10:17.140 --> 10:19.820
but I'm here to assure you
that we will do everything we can

10:19.820 --> 10:22.971
to help you proceed
impartially on the facts.

10:24.780 --> 10:26.260
OK.

10:26.260 --> 10:28.780
Just play it straight, Joe, OK?

10:28.780 --> 10:31.660
And if you get any pressure
to adjust that breathalyser reading

10:31.660 --> 10:33.412
call me immediately.

10:34.780 --> 10:36.850
Thanks.

10:38.020 --> 10:41.940
Oh, and congratulations.
Jimbo told me the news.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.056
(LAUGHS)

10:45.460 --> 10:46.940
I, um...

10:46.940 --> 10:51.180
I wasn't gonna tell you
because I didn't think it was official, so...

10:51.180 --> 10:53.620
I got an invitation to be a D.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.700
By who? Jim Egan?

10:55.700 --> 10:57.500
Well, and some of the others.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.500
They just said they thought it was time
they had a woman...

11:00.500 --> 11:01.980
Uh-huh.

11:01.980 --> 11:06.980
...on the squad as a detective.

11:06.980 --> 11:10.256
Well, good on you.

11:11.300 --> 11:14.140
Yeah.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.180
BENNY: That's the guy
Billy gets his drugs from.

11:16.180 --> 11:21.860
Remember, don't hand over the cash
until you've seen the gear.

11:21.860 --> 11:25.091
Doesn't work like that.
You give the cash, then you get the gear.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.620
I don't wanna get ripped.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.975
Yeah, well, maybe you should think
about that before we come out.

11:37.940 --> 11:39.740
You by yourself tonight?

11:39.740 --> 11:43.255
Yeah. Just after one.

12:11.020 --> 12:13.488
What? Come on.
I'll cut. You cap.

12:16.180 --> 12:19.340
NARRATOR: Norm was right.
They tripled their money in a week.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.980
Benny Kassab was on cloud nine.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.620
He was going to be rich in no time flat.

12:23.620 --> 12:25.300
BILL: New car, huh?

12:25.300 --> 12:29.500
But you know what they say
about biting the hand that feeds you...

12:29.500 --> 12:32.537
Looks like Hardas
is paying you too much, boy.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.260
MELISSA: Hey, Kimmy, visitor.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.100
For you.
Oh!

12:43.100 --> 12:46.700
They're beautiful. Thank you.

12:46.700 --> 12:50.136
I'll just take these
to wither and die in private.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.220
Thank you.

12:55.220 --> 12:57.460
That's alright.
What are you doing here?

12:57.460 --> 12:59.780
Well, I had something
I wanted to ask you.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.540
See, I'm organising a fundraiser
for the Police Olympics

13:02.540 --> 13:04.300
and we need some entertainment.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.580
Now, one of the boys
suggested strippers

13:06.580 --> 13:09.333
and I thought, "What about getting Kim?"

13:12.060 --> 13:15.340
You want me to do a strip? No way!

13:15.340 --> 13:19.420
Don't get me wrong. It'd be classy.
It's like a charity benefit thing.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.460
Yeah. No, I'm not offended.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.018
Well...

13:25.380 --> 13:30.060
It's just who's gonna pay to watch me?

13:30.060 --> 13:33.620
Are you kidding?
Just everyone with a dick.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.860
Strippers can dance. I can't dance.

13:35.860 --> 13:38.220
You can. I've seen you.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.100
Even if you couldn't,
you're that bloody gorgeous

13:40.100 --> 13:42.060
no-one would give a shit.

13:42.060 --> 13:45.420
Look, a lot of those boys...

13:45.420 --> 13:49.891
getting to the Games, it's their dream.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.460
How many?

13:53.460 --> 13:55.260
A small crowd. Very intimate.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.940
Hmm. All cops?

13:57.940 --> 13:59.498
All cops.

14:36.820 --> 14:39.980
When you said 'kindergarten',
I didn't expect it to be so...

14:39.980 --> 14:41.980
Kindergartenish.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.860
The owners,
they know what we're doing?

14:43.860 --> 14:47.580
Dance practice. Well, we are.

14:47.580 --> 14:50.140
Where did you get these?

14:50.140 --> 14:52.380
They're mine. And the hire shop's.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.340
I hope you didn't spend your own money.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.940
So? It's all for charity.

14:55.940 --> 14:58.460
Yeah. She's been up all night
making dance routines.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.660
You have crossed the line.
KIM: I have not.

15:01.660 --> 15:06.460
Anyway, it's different this time.
Dave's different.

15:06.460 --> 15:09.300
Yeah, she's in love.
I'm not, alright?

15:09.300 --> 15:12.100
Anyway, it's not about that.
Come on, girls.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.700
No such thing as love,
Kimmy, only money.

15:15.700 --> 15:19.340
Yeah. Well, you're getting 750 bucks
for this, OK? So we're all winners.

15:19.340 --> 15:23.936
OK, let's do this.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.900
NARRATOR: Bill Bayeh
was a born diplomat

15:31.900 --> 15:34.539
who believed the best way
to solve a problem was negotiation.

15:35.860 --> 15:39.740
His brother Louis
couldn't even spell the word.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.900
His natural instinct
was to bang heads together first

15:41.900 --> 15:43.936
and then discuss the finer points later.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.700
Let me put it another way.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.340
Everyone loved Billy,

15:49.340 --> 15:52.300
while they crossed the street
to avoid big bad Louis.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.220
But despite their differences
they stuck together.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.300
If you made an enemy of one Bayeh

15:57.300 --> 15:59.940
you'd have the other one
breathing down your neck.

15:59.940 --> 16:02.100
We're down again on the coke.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.700
My guess?
Everybody go across the road.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.700
To who?

16:06.700 --> 16:09.140
To your mate, Kassab.

16:09.140 --> 16:12.060
(TUTS) He's a fucking child.

16:12.060 --> 16:13.580
MAN: I heard the same, Mr Bayeh.

16:13.580 --> 16:16.420
Little prick's undercutting you on price.
Gear's the same quality.

16:16.420 --> 16:18.660
I go tonight. I shoot him in his knees.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.093
No.

16:21.220 --> 16:23.900
We do something else.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.175

16:27.220 --> 16:29.220

a few problems with it lately,

16:29.220 --> 16:30.780
but it's a simple enough system, really.

does not help. I'm sorry about them.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.060
Welcome to the King's Cross
detectives, love.

16:46.060 --> 16:49.220
Bloody great to be here.
Yeah, good.

16:49.220 --> 16:54.100
I drew the short straw so you're
out with me today, love. You right?

16:54.100 --> 16:57.900
(LAUGHS) Take it home
for the missus, Scully.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.460

17:04.859 --> 17:06.500
That's me giggie over there.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.859
He reckons he's got something to tell me
so we're just gonna have a little chat.

17:09.859 --> 17:11.339
You want me to come?
No, no.

17:11.339 --> 17:13.980
Just sit down. Put your feet up.
Have a piece of banana cake.

17:13.980 --> 17:15.571

17:21.339 --> 17:22.900
Hey, Detective. Got you a long black.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.579
I'm in a hurry, Jacky. What you got?

17:25.579 --> 17:27.500
Heard of a boy named Benny Kassab?
Mm-hm.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.380
Bouncer. Works for Steve Hardas.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.813
Yeah.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.931
He's not just a bouncer no more.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.815
Turned off at the mains.
Right. Let's roll.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.180
Wait. No, you're down here,
love, on lookout.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.660
Look out for what?

17:43.660 --> 17:45.980
For suspicious characters.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.820
Fuck! The sink. The sink.

18:10.820 --> 18:11.980
(GRUNTS)

18:11.980 --> 18:13.820
There's no water.
Quick. Throw it.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.253
We got four ounces here, man.

18:17.940 --> 18:20.780
Right, up against the window.
Up against the window.

18:20.780 --> 18:23.980
Hands on the table.
Spread your legs. Spread your legs!

18:23.980 --> 18:27.300
What's going on in here, gentlemen?
Nothing's going on, mate.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.820
Nothing, huh?
SEAN: Bingo.

18:29.820 --> 18:33.020
Aha! So what's this?

18:33.020 --> 18:35.900
Don't know.
So it's not yours?

18:35.900 --> 18:37.620
I never seen that before, mate.

18:37.620 --> 18:41.260
Well, we'd better take it with us, Trev.
There you go.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.940
Hand it in to police lost and found, hey?

18:43.940 --> 18:46.140
Well, looks like everything's
in order here, then.

18:46.140 --> 18:49.260
Yeah. Well, sorry for
the inconvenience, gentlemen.

You're not charging us?

18:59.140 --> 19:00.220
What with?

19:00.220 --> 19:03.940
There's no drugs here, are there?

19:03.940 --> 19:05.460
Nope.

(DETECTIVES LAUGH)

False alarm.

19:16.940 --> 19:19.900
Tell you what, Deb. You wanna help out?

19:19.900 --> 19:21.940
There's a bottlo across the road.
Show 'em your badge.

It's nearly knock-off time, alright?

19:24.540 --> 19:26.656
(SCOFFS)

19:28.340 --> 19:31.460
JIM: 3.9 ounces,
according to police scales.

19:31.460 --> 19:35.420
It's been handled.
It's spoiled goods. I'll give you 8.

19:35.420 --> 19:39.049
Make it an even 10 plus a slab
and you've got a deal.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.180
NARRATOR: There was
a system in the Cross

19:46.180 --> 19:48.978
and it worked almost too well...

19:51.020 --> 19:54.376
...because when things are easy,
the people who run the show get lazy.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.299
They forget there's always
someone else nipping at their heels.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.660
It's good to have balls, boy.

20:10.660 --> 20:14.619
But you hang them out too far,
you might lose them. Hmm?

20:24.540 --> 20:28.380
Now, with the Susie Wallis DUI,
we're gonna try for a section 10.

20:28.380 --> 20:31.540
She's had two speeding tickets
in six months. Don't like your chances.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.540
Oh, thanks for your support.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.260
Hey, you're the counsel
for the defendant.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.490
Why would I be supporting you?

20:40.580 --> 20:42.180
Well, why am I here?

20:42.180 --> 20:45.260
Well, to cover both our arses.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.660
I just want to ensure that
you'll be examining all the facts

20:47.660 --> 20:50.900
from an impartial
but scientific perspective.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.380
What do you mean?

20:52.380 --> 20:55.060
She was stopped with
a blood alcohol reading of 0.081.

20:55.060 --> 20:57.900
That's the only fact that counts, isn't it?

20:57.900 --> 20:59.420
Well, not quite.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.020
The fact that counts

21:01.020 --> 21:03.820
is when she was officially tested
back at the police station

21:03.820 --> 21:05.333
she was 0.081.

21:07.740 --> 21:10.334
Devil's in the details, correct?

21:17.660 --> 21:19.500
Where did this come from?

21:19.500 --> 21:21.220
Susie Wallis's lawyer.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.260
He says that she couldn't
have been over the limit

21:23.260 --> 21:24.740
when we breathalysed her.

21:24.740 --> 21:25.820
Why's that?

21:25.820 --> 21:28.340
Because her last drink was only
a few minutes before she was stopped.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.260
Her blood alcohol level
would've been still going up

21:30.260 --> 21:33.900
for the half hour we had her
in the station before we did the analysis,

21:33.900 --> 21:37.380
and she was driving home,
which was only five minutes away,

21:37.380 --> 21:40.220
and 0.081 is only 0.001
over the legal limit.

21:40.220 --> 21:43.780
Right, which is within
the breathalyser's margin of error,

21:43.780 --> 21:46.220
which means she could
have been below the limit

21:46.220 --> 21:48.020
while in control of the vehicle.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.740
That's what their experts say.

21:49.740 --> 21:53.020
If we proceed to court against all this
it'll look like we're out and out bastards

21:53.020 --> 21:55.056
trying to embarrass the minister.

21:58.060 --> 22:00.820
Let's drop it, alright?

22:00.820 --> 22:03.980
Actually, look. Leave it with me.

22:03.980 --> 22:06.740
I'll handle it. I'll leave you out of it.

I've got a box at the State of Origin game
if you're interested?

23:00.100 --> 23:01.780
I wanna talk business.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.140
You helped me out one time before

23:04.140 --> 23:07.940
so I thought you and me, you know,
I thought we were alright.

23:07.940 --> 23:12.460
You got in a blue doing your job
and I sorted it out.

23:12.460 --> 23:16.660
Now, Benny, that is worlds away
from dealing hard drugs.

23:16.660 --> 23:20.740
OK, but maybe us two...

23:20.740 --> 23:24.100
Maybe we can make an arrangement,
you know, like Bill has with Trevor,

23:24.100 --> 23:26.740
make sure everyone's happy.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.180
JIM: He said he'll keep it off the streets.

23:29.180 --> 23:32.260
No kids, no smack.

23:32.260 --> 23:33.860
What's the size of it?

23:33.860 --> 23:36.260
300 a week.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.260
Mmm. Want to let him run for a bit?

23:38.260 --> 23:41.060
Well, I thought I'd best speak to you first.

23:41.060 --> 23:45.740
Alright. Well, tell him I said
it'll have to be five a week.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.298
Make it worth our while, eh?

23:49.020 --> 23:53.420
That wasn't what I meant, Trev.
Bayeh won't be happy, will he?

23:53.420 --> 23:54.900
Well, fuck Bayeh.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.820
Yeah, but we're all getting
a bloody good drink there, mate.

23:58.820 --> 24:03.291

Us or Billy?

(WHISTLES)

24:28.460 --> 24:31.700
NARRATOR: The Budget Hotel
was the perfect one-stop cocaine shop.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.460
80 bucks got you a cap,
a room and a spoon.

24:34.460 --> 24:38.860
For the working girls
it was in, out, back to work,

24:38.860 --> 24:40.660
then into the Budget again,

24:40.660 --> 24:43.300
however many times it took
to get them through their day.

24:43.300 --> 24:47.532
And the money they made
all ended up in one place.

24:48.940 --> 24:51.340
Except, of course,
for the 500 bucks a week

24:51.340 --> 24:53.580
that went to the King's Cross detectives.

24:53.580 --> 24:56.740
Trevor wasn't worried
about two-timing Billy.

24:56.740 --> 24:59.459
After all, the cops were in charge,
weren't they?

25:01.340 --> 25:03.620
But he hadn't factored in
big brother Louis.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.980
Is that... is that Louis Bayeh?

25:05.980 --> 25:08.060
Oh, yeah. All 300 pounds of him.

25:08.060 --> 25:12.380

pays for all this? Petty cash?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.640
They didn't tell me it would take
an hour and a half, though.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.880
(LAUGHS) They trick you, clever girls.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.155
You tell them I give them
a big kiss tomorrow.

40:58.880 --> 41:02.156
I love you, Lou.
I love you all, sweetheart. 'Bye.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.600
SHAKA: Is this it?
NORM: This is it.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.153
Don't miss.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.599
Ahhh!

41:31.240 --> 41:32.720
Enough!

41:32.720 --> 41:34.720
You hit anyone?
I killed them all.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.756
All of them?
All dead.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.154
Where Kassab?
He's not here.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.830
(COUGHS)

42:15.600 --> 42:18.034
Yeah, got that, VKG. Will attend. Over.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.280
What?

42:21.280 --> 42:25.040
We got a problem. Someone shot
the shit out of Louis Bayeh's house.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.951
Now he's gone nuts in the Cross.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.518
(ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)

42:46.560 --> 42:49.040
Word on the street,
it was Norm and Shaka.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.960
Louis's wife and kids, they're alright?

42:50.960 --> 42:52.640
From what I heard, yeah.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.200
Hey. Want me to call Hammer?

42:56.200 --> 42:57.720
No, not yet.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.438
Are you sure?
No, stay here.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.356
Benny Kassab, hmm.

43:09.080 --> 43:10.560
What's up, mate?

43:10.560 --> 43:12.280
Hey, I didn't do this, John.
Ah.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.720
Shaka's a nut job, man.
Oh, you didn't know that?

43:14.720 --> 43:18.040
Huh, the first thing I hear about this prick
is "steer well clear",

43:18.040 --> 43:21.160
but you, you give him a job
and now you come whingeing to me, eh?

43:21.160 --> 43:24.280
You're so smart, huh?
Hey, smart enough, Benny.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.960
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's easy to be smart

43:25.960 --> 43:27.951
when you've got Hammer there
watching your arse, isn't it?

43:29.960 --> 43:32.960
I just run a business. Right?

43:32.960 --> 43:34.440
Mmm.
Yeah.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.000
You start wars,
you finish them yourself, mate.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.911
Go the back way.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Deb.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.956
Joe.
MAN: Egan!

44:05.400 --> 44:07.960
Where Trevor? Hiding?
He's off duty.

44:07.960 --> 44:09.800
Him and you both,
you take my brother's money.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.640
What you fucking do for us? Nothing?
Alright, so...

44:11.640 --> 44:13.200
They shoot my family!
Louis, I know.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.040
You take money from them,
they shoot my family?!

44:15.040 --> 44:16.040
We'll talk later!

44:16.040 --> 44:18.040
I bring you down, Egan,
him and you both!

44:18.040 --> 44:21.077
Fucking Haken. Fuck. Fuck him!

44:52.140 --> 44:54.051
Maria.

44:55.780 --> 44:58.419
Maria. Wait, what did they say?

45:00.620 --> 45:02.338
Don't touch me.

45:03.380 --> 45:05.894
Just don't touch me.
