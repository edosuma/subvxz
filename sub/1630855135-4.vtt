I always commiserate with
Anne when he's short with her.

who doesn't understand children.

But he does.

FATHER DIRKSEN:
You know, friends.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.033
I think it's safe to say
that this year many of us are

09:35.033 --> 09:38.703
not experiencing the
joy that the Advent season

09:38.703 --> 09:41.080
typically provides.

09:41.080 --> 09:46.086
And with air raid wardens
enforcing black-out rules,

09:46.086 --> 09:52.717
compelling us to snuff out the
light even in our own homes.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.138
One does not have to
reach far for the metaphor.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.934
These are dangerous times
to be bearers of light.

10:04.510 --> 10:05.230
(knocking)

10:05.230 --> 10:07.649
TESS: Miep!

10:07.649 --> 10:09.317
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.027
MIEP: Jan said he was
going to see his brother,

10:11.027 --> 10:12.612
but he went in
the wrong direction.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.072
So I followed him and...

10:14.072 --> 10:15.281
TESS: That bastard.
Is he cheating?

10:15.281 --> 10:17.325
MIEP: No. No.
It's worse than that.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.451
He's going to church.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.328
(laughing)

10:20.328 --> 10:21.454
It's not funny.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.872
TESS: Oh, come on.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.207
Your husband pops into
church and you're acting like

10:24.207 --> 10:25.416
it's the end of the world.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.751
It's hilarious.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.837
MIEP: He's not religious.
TESS: I think he is now.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.506
MIEP: I'm not religious.
My family is not religious.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.258
TESS: They're a
bunch of Socialists,

10:33.258 --> 10:35.635
which is a
religion if you ask me.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.220
It's a cult.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.265
MIEP: It's a cult that I love
and I thought Jan did as well.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.892
DORA: I thought
I heard your voice.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.978
How are you, my love?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.437
TESS: Oh, well, she's terrible.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.356
Looks like her husband is
having an affair with Jesus.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.899
MIEP: Don't listen to her.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.317
No, I'm fine.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.444
It's just my husband has
been sneaking off to church.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.280
And it's made me feel weird.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.282
DORA: You got
yourself a churchy one?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.617
That can be a good thing.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.328
I wouldn't know of course,
I always pick cheaters.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.914
Tess' father,
don't get me started.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.249
TESS: No, we won't.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.792
Come on, you.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.544
DORA: Oh, but he did give me
this little angel, didn't he?

11:09.544 --> 11:11.504
TESS: Oh, I know
what you were like.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.797
DORA: All right.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.841
Well, I'll give
you some privacy.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.843
Don't be a stranger, Miep.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.761
MIEP: I won't.
Lovely to see you.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.139
TESS: Bye.

11:21.514 --> 11:27.270
MIEP: How's she doing?
TESS: Uh, well, she's the same.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.857
Yeah.

11:35.904 --> 11:39.240
The radiotherapy
is not working.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.909
(sighs)

11:40.909 --> 11:44.621
But Daniel says he's
heard of some German doctor

11:44.621 --> 11:49.417
who's using chemicals so,
and we're looking into that.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.045
MIEP: I'm sorry I
haven't been around much.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.214
TESS: Who can blame you?

11:55.214 --> 12:00.595
My mom is dying.
It's pretty depressing.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.431
You know, some days,
I don't even wanna be here.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.767
Does that make me terrible?

12:05.767 --> 12:10.980
MIEP: No.
TESS: I think it does.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.736
Maybe I should go
to church with Jan.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.615
MIEP: Why didn't he tell me?

12:20.615 --> 12:22.283
He lied.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.578
TESS: Because you're judgy.
MIEP: No, I'm not.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.289
TESS: Yes, you are.
I feel judged sometimes.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.416
MIEP: By me?
TESS: Yes.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.710
Miep, you've got a job,
you've got money.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.254
MIEP: Not much.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.922
TESS: Yeah, but
you're self-reliant.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.382
I mean, I don't
have a job right now.

12:37.382 --> 12:40.093
MIEP: I'm not judging you.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.471
TESS: Fine.
Maybe I'm judging me.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.099
MIEP: You have a lot.
TESS: I have a boyfriend.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.103
MIEP: You're going to
study fashion in Paris.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.729
TESS: Do you really
think that will happen?

12:51.729 --> 12:54.023
MIEP: Yeah, I do.
As soon as the war's over.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.068
TESS: Oh, God, the war.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.654
I hate the war.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.534
Oh, I just had a
really good idea.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.994
MIEP: What?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.870
TESS: Well, we need a
break from the war and

13:07.870 --> 13:11.124
from cancer and lying husbands.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.084
Let's have an ice skating party.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.170
MIEP: Ice skating?
TESS: Yeah.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.380
Like the one we have
when we were at school.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.798
Do you remember?
It was fantastic!

13:18.798 --> 13:20.800
MIEP: The canals
aren't frozen over.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.844
TESS: Oh, we'll have it
at Daniel's parents' house.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.554
And I'll get the
gardeners to hose down the,

13:24.554 --> 13:26.889
the courtyard and we'll
make it into an ice rink.

13:26.889 --> 13:30.059
MIEP: Hmm, I'll
get the gardeners to
hose down the courtyard.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.227
TESS: Oh, come on.
MIEP: And we'll make...

13:31.227 --> 13:34.605
TESS: Miss judgy.
There she is. Told you.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.400
MIEP: Sorry. Sorry.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.987
JAN: Our group is
grateful for all your help.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.780
FATHER DIRKSEN: Well,
to be honest, I'm not sure

13:42.780 --> 13:44.574
I am helping.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.702
She's been so distraught lately.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.582
Crying and talking
about wanting to die.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.294
If people hear her,
the wrong kind of people,

13:56.294 --> 14:00.631
we could all be held
responsible for hiding Jews.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.260
My whole congregation
would be at risk.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.013
JAN: That's why I'm here.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.307
Hopefully, this
will calm her down.

14:09.307 --> 14:13.436
FATHER DIRKSEN: I tell myself,
I'm trying to keep her alive.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.898
At what cost?

14:24.238 --> 14:27.533
It's all right. He's a friend.

14:33.831 --> 14:38.127
JAN: Hello. My name is Jan.

14:38.878 --> 14:43.132
I've got a
photograph of your son.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.968
I got there late and
it was getting dark.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.762
But I did the best I could.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.556
ISAAC: Oh! Look. There he is.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.434
The face. That smile.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.895
That's our boy.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.272
MAYA: He's, he's not that tall.

14:58.272 --> 15:01.692
ISAAC: He's grown.
It's been eight months?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.569
That's him.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.072
MAYA: That's not him.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.203
JAN: I took that
photo myself two days ago.

15:12.203 --> 15:15.832
Believe me, this is your son.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.877
MAYA: Where is he?
JAN: I can't tell you.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.421
For his protection.

15:22.421 --> 15:26.384
MAYA: I'm his mother and
I can't know where he is?

15:26.384 --> 15:28.177
I am his mother!

15:28.177 --> 15:31.180
ISAAC: Maya, be, be calm.
MAYA: Calm?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.432
I let you talk me
into giving him up.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.726
And now I just want
to see him and I can't.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.687
I don't see my little boy.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.021
I see a stranger.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.481
ISAAC: Maya. Maya!
MAYA: I want to see my boy!

15:40.481 --> 15:42.358
ISAAC: Maya!
MAYA: Let me see by baby!
ISAAC: Maya!

15:42.358 --> 15:43.818
FATHER DIRKSEN:
Be quiet! Please!

15:43.818 --> 15:48.364
ISAAC: Maya! Quiet! Quiet.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.784
(crying)

15:51.784 --> 15:55.246
ISAAC: Shh, shh. I know.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.998
MAYA: I miss my baby.
ISAAC: Listen, I know.

15:56.998 --> 16:02.670
I know, okay? I know.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.883
JAN: I thought this would work.
FATHER DIRKSEN: So did I.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.762
JAN: Hello. Smells good.
MIEP: I'm, I'm making cod.

16:11.762 --> 16:16.017
JAN: Hmm. Mrs. Stoppelman?

16:16.017 --> 16:21.564
MIEP: She went out.
JAN: I'm going to have a bath.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.318
MIEP: Mm-hmm.
JAN: I won't be long.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.070
MIEP: Do you find me judgmental?

16:28.070 --> 16:31.657
JAN: Uh, I don't know. Should I?

16:31.657 --> 16:34.452
MIEP: Tess does.
JAN: Tess? Does she?

16:34.452 --> 16:36.162
MIEP: Mm-hmm.

16:36.162 --> 16:41.500
You know, I, um,
went to her house today,

16:41.500 --> 16:44.295
while you were at church.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.298
I followed you.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.926
And you didn't go to
your brother's house.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.260
JAN: You followed me?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.012
MIEP: I thought you
were having an affair.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.972
JAN: You thought I
was having an affair?

16:54.972 --> 16:56.682
MIEP: Now, you're just
repeating everything I'm saying.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.643
JAN: I'm not having an affair.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.561
MIEP: But rather than
spending the day with me,

17:00.561 --> 17:02.188
you went to church.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.856
JAN: Miep.
MIEP: And lied about it.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.274
What, what else
are you lying about?

17:05.274 --> 17:06.776
And is it because you
think I'll judge you?

17:06.776 --> 17:09.362
JAN: No. No, no.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.072
You know, I'm sorry, okay?

17:11.072 --> 17:14.283
I, I, I shouldn't,
I shouldn't have lied.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.955
MIEP: Why did you go to church?

17:22.291 --> 17:27.505
JAN: I'm trying to feel
like my life is meaningful.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.757
MIEP: Am I not meaningful?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.926
Is our marriage not meaningful?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.469
JAN: Of course it is.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.806
MIEP: You know, I keep thinking
about your first marriage and

17:36.806 --> 17:39.892
how you changed and grew apart.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.186
JAN: Miep. No.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.314
It's completely different.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.650
We're good, we're great.

17:48.568 --> 17:52.113
I just went to church.

17:52.113 --> 17:55.199
Sorry I lied.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.293
MIEP: I wish we could
just get rid of the door.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.128
JOHANNES: What do you mean?

18:07.128 --> 18:09.130
Just wall them in or something?

18:09.130 --> 18:10.381
MIEP: No, no.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.676
Like cover it up with a
fake wall or something?

18:13.676 --> 18:16.220
VICTOR: And how do
you propose we do that?

18:16.220 --> 18:19.056
BEP: Miep?
Someone's here for you.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.976
She wouldn't say
what it was about.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.860
MIEP: Lotte!

18:30.860 --> 18:32.069
Everybody, this is, um,

18:32.069 --> 18:34.614
this is my friend,
Carlotta, Lotte.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.074
Uh, she's engaged to my dentist.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.785
You've heard me
mention Doctor Pfeffer.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.245
JOHANNES: Oh. Hello.
BEP: Nice to meet you, Lotte.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.830
VICTOR: Hello.
LOTTE: Hello.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.751
Miep, I'm sorry to drop by,
but I have something for you.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.919
Happy Sinterklaas.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.963
MIEP: Oh! Oh, uh, wow!

18:50.963 --> 18:52.340
Thank you so much.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.217
You shouldn't have.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.428
LOTTE: Could I
speak to you privately?

18:57.428 --> 18:59.764
MIEP: Of course, let's take
this into the kitchen.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.600
Follow me.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.436
LOTTE: I'm sorry for
surprising you like this,

19:05.436 --> 19:07.480
but the basket is for Fritz.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.108
MIEP: I thought so.
LOTTE: It's for Hanukkah.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.778
Just in case you were going
to visit him in the country

19:13.778 --> 19:15.321
any time soon.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.240
Are you?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.451
MIEP: I am, actually.
LOTTE: Oh.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.120
I don't suppose you
could take me with you?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.455
(laughing)

19:24.455 --> 19:27.375
I'm joking, of course.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.293
It's just going to be
a very lonely holiday.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.795
MIEP: I just need to
check on something, Lotte.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.171
I'll, I'll be right back.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.631
LOTTE: Oh, oh, no.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.383
I'm disturbing in the middle
of your work day, I'll go.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.467
MIEP: No, no, no.
Don't be silly.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.886
Sit down. Stay there.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.690
Dr. Pfeffer, I have
a surprise for you.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.820
Just wait there.

20:10.459 --> 20:16.716
♪ ♪

20:16.716 --> 20:18.509
MIEP (muffled): Sorry
about that, Lotte.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.095
So, show me what you bought him.

20:21.095 --> 20:24.598
LOTTE: Well, it's
all very sentimental.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.646
This is the marmalade he likes.

20:31.689 --> 20:37.194
Macaroons and chocolate babka.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.948
I made it.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.826
We had smoked
herring on our first date.

20:43.826 --> 20:47.204
And we were walking
by a street vendor,

20:47.204 --> 20:51.876
and Fritz turned, said,
"I hope you like herring,

20:51.876 --> 20:55.087
because if you do,
you're the woman of my dreams."

20:55.087 --> 20:58.007
FRITZ: You're the
woman of my dreams.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.385
MIEP: And, um, is there
anything you'd like me to say

21:01.385 --> 21:05.055
to him when I see him?

21:05.639 --> 21:09.185
LOTTE: Um, that I love him.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.939
And, uh, tell him that
I'm being very strong,

21:13.939 --> 21:16.859
just like he told me to be.

21:16.859 --> 21:20.654
And just urge
him to stay strong.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.699
We'll be together again soon.

21:23.699 --> 21:28.245
(crying)

21:31.540 --> 21:34.919
FRITZ: You don't know
what a gift you have given me.

21:34.919 --> 21:39.548
MIEP: She's lovely.
FRITZ: Yes. Yes, she is.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.600
ANNE: I want
some chocolate babka.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.851
OTTO: Anne.

21:50.851 --> 21:54.647
(laughing)

21:55.773 --> 21:57.024
So do I.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.568
(laughing)

22:07.034 --> 22:09.286
ANNE: Kalverstraat.
PETER: Pay up.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.871
(laughing)

22:10.871 --> 22:12.331
ANNE: Well, I guess if
I'm gonna be a writer,

22:12.331 --> 22:14.291
I should be used to being poor.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.460
MIEP: Well, maybe
you'll be a big success.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.130
HERMANN: Oh, full house!

22:20.130 --> 22:21.924
ANNE: If you're
looking for the basket,

22:21.924 --> 22:25.844
it's at the end of his bed.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.599
HERMANN: There it is.
ANNE: He's taunting us with it.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.809
Rude.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.602
MIEP: Be nice.
ANNE: Well, tell him to be nice!

22:33.602 --> 22:35.020
We have nothing for Hanukkah!

22:35.020 --> 22:37.231
MARGOT: We have each other.

22:37.231 --> 22:39.191
ANNE: Do you do
that just to annoy me?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.860
MARGOT: Do what?
ANNE: "We have each other."

22:40.860 --> 22:43.821
Yes, we do, but it would
be nice to have a macaroon.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.032
EDITH: Oh, hello everyone.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.826
HERMANN: It's at
the end of the bed.

22:48.826 --> 22:51.912
EDITH: What? Still?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.998
HERMANN: At least
Miep's plan is working.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.749
Pfeffer's not talking
about leaving anymore.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.752
PETER: Ba-bap! "It's
Doctor Pfeffer, if you please."

22:58.752 --> 23:01.547
HERMANN: Peter.
EDITH: I'm sorry.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.967
I really wanted to
make Hanukkah special.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.554
ANNE: I know.
We can have a special guest.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.930
Miep, you can come!

23:09.930 --> 23:10.973
PETER: Oh, yeah!
MARGOT: Yes!

23:10.973 --> 23:12.016
ANNE: Yeah, please.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.225
MARGOT: Come to
Hanukkah tomorrow!

23:13.225 --> 23:14.768
ANNE: Margot can sing.
Please, please, please!

23:14.768 --> 23:16.228
MIEP: That sounds like the best
invitation ever, but I can't.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.439
I have to go to this
party thing tomorrow night.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.066
ANNE: Mm, party?
EDITH: What kind of party?

23:21.066 --> 23:23.444
ANNE: Yeah, what kind of party?
MIEP: Oh, it, it's nothing.

23:23.444 --> 23:26.739
Just my friend Tess
and I throwing this
little skating party.

23:26.739 --> 23:30.409
PETER: Oh, we miss skating.
MARGOT: And parties.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.536
ANNE: And friends.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.172
TESS: So, I invited
everyone and they all
said they're coming, so.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.882
MIEP: Excellent! Excellent!

23:44.882 --> 23:46.675
TESS: Yes!
MIEP: And Kat?

23:46.675 --> 23:49.094
TESS: Kat? Kat doesn't
come to parties anymore.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.846
Kat's a brood mare.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.932
Popping out children
at the speed of light.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.017
MIEP: Uh, Sofia?
TESS: Uh, no.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.977
Sofia and I had a
bit of a falling out.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.395
MIEP: What? Over what?

23:58.395 --> 23:59.980
TESS: I called Kat,
"A brood mare."

23:59.980 --> 24:01.315
MIEP: Tess, they're sisters!

24:01.315 --> 24:02.858
TESS: Yeah, I know!
I just forgot!

24:02.858 --> 24:04.234
Look, can you stop worrying
about the guest list, please?

24:04.234 --> 24:06.028
I need to tell you about
decorations and catering.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.072
MIEP: Catering?
TESS: Yes, catering.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.741
Stop with the
little asides as well.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.285
The presents, ah, here.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.165
Now, I've got you something.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.292
MIEP: No, we said we
weren't gonna do gifts
because of the war.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.544
TESS: I know, but
I changed my mind.

24:22.544 --> 24:26.090
Look, I'm gonna say
something and you're
not allowed to laugh, okay?

24:26.090 --> 24:27.675
Because if, if you laugh,
then I'll get embarrassed,

24:27.675 --> 24:29.176
then I'll laugh,
and then I'll sneeze,

24:29.176 --> 24:30.552
then I'll start to cry.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.221
MIEP: And you make a
really ugly face when you cry.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.974
TESS: Stop! Okay.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.103
When I first met you,
you were this scrawny thing

24:39.103 --> 24:41.605
fresh off the train from Vienna.

24:41.605 --> 24:47.069
And I was this girl with
no father and no friends.

24:47.069 --> 24:51.198
But together, we managed to
make the world less lonely.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.742
And when you
popped by the other day,

24:53.742 --> 24:55.869
I realized how much
I've missed you.

24:55.869 --> 25:01.583
And my best friend, who's no
longer scrawny and weird.

25:01.583 --> 25:06.505
You've transformed
into something incredible.

25:06.797 --> 25:10.634
You're like a
beautiful butterfly.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.470
So, open it.

25:20.602 --> 25:24.106
MIEP: Wow. Butterflies?
TESS: Sapphires.

25:24.106 --> 25:27.526
And the chain's real gold.

25:28.402 --> 25:29.820
Look, you deserve it,

25:29.820 --> 25:33.198
so don't give me any of
your normal nonsense, okay?

25:33.198 --> 25:36.952
MIEP: Beautiful.
TESS: Here, let me.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.288
Come on.

25:51.258 --> 25:54.178
MIEP: How did you afford this?

25:54.178 --> 25:58.348
TESS: Well, I have a rich
and very generous boyfriend.

26:00.285 --> 26:03.979
MIEP: It's so pretty,
I might sleep in it.

26:03.979 --> 26:07.733
I should wear it as much as I
can before I have to sell it.

26:09.276 --> 26:12.946
I, I do have to
sell it, right?

26:12.946 --> 26:17.493
It's, oh, it's the prettiest
thing I've ever owned.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.244
It's not like I bought it.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.455
It was a gift.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.040
Meanwhile, Anne Frank can't

26:23.040 --> 26:25.834
afford one piece
of Hanukkah candy.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.461
No, I'm selling it!

26:27.461 --> 26:29.880
I'll just wear it to the
party so Tess can see me in it,

26:29.880 --> 26:31.048
and then I'll sell it.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.758
That's fair, right?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.843
JAN: What party?
MIEP: What?

26:34.843 --> 26:36.970
Tess' party,
our party, tomorrow.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.473
JAN: Oh, God.
I don't wanna go to a party.

26:39.473 --> 26:43.018
MIEP: What? It'll be fun.
JAN: Will it?

26:43.018 --> 26:47.523
When half the country is
in hiding, starving, dying.

26:47.523 --> 26:51.110
I don't think anyone
should be going to any parties.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.032
MIEP: Do you feel
guilty being out when our
friends are hidden inside?

26:57.032 --> 26:58.909
JAN: Don't you?

26:58.909 --> 27:01.203
MIEP: Is that why
you're going to church?

27:01.203 --> 27:02.955
To deal with your guilt?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.457
JAN: Yeah. Maybe.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.835
MIEP: Oh, I forgot to
tell you, I'm a genius.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.545
I fixed the Pfeffer problem.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.672
Lotte came around, I took
her into the kitchen so that

27:11.672 --> 27:13.632
he could hear her voice.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.926
JAN: Her voice?
MIEP: Through the vent.

27:15.926 --> 27:19.304
And hearing it just calmed him.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.557
JAN: That could work.
MIEP: It did work.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.476
I mean, he thanked me about
ten times and stopped scowling.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.187
JAN: That's, yeah,
that's perfect.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.606
You are a genius.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.574
All right. We need to
be very, very quiet.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.992
For his safety.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.287
MAYA: Yes.
ISAAC: Maya?

27:47.249 --> 27:51.169
JAN: Okay. Come on.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.465
She said she
can't stay long, she's,

27:55.465 --> 27:58.135
she's going to bring a ball.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.513
He likes to play catch.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.600
ISAAC: He looks good.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.644
He looks, he looks healthy.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.605
(crying)

28:09.605 --> 28:11.523
MAYA: He's crying.
He doesn't like her.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.775
ISAAC: No, he's just cold.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.361
He's just cold.

28:16.361 --> 28:19.948
MAYA: Nathan. Nathan!
JAN: Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

28:19.948 --> 28:22.993
MAYA: Nathan!

28:26.371 --> 28:28.874
JAN: Maya, stop!

28:29.374 --> 28:32.920
MAYA: No! Nathan!
I need my son!

28:32.920 --> 28:35.714
No! No!

28:35.714 --> 28:38.717
Nathan! Nathan!

28:38.717 --> 28:44.514
(crying)

28:49.686 --> 28:53.440
MIEP: Bep, what is it?
BEP: It's a surprise!

28:56.234 --> 29:00.614
MIEP: Oh, my goodness.
BEP: Isn't it incredible?

29:00.614 --> 29:03.116
Now watch this.

29:03.116 --> 29:06.119
(whistling)

29:07.537 --> 29:10.290
MIEP: Wow!

29:10.290 --> 29:13.418
ANNE: Welcome to the
safest place in Amsterdam!

29:15.629 --> 29:17.673
EDITH: Miep! You're back.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.424
Have you brought us
a Hanukkah miracle?

29:19.424 --> 29:22.302
MIEP: Well, it's a miracle
considering the circumstances

29:22.302 --> 29:25.722
that I got you some
turnips and a pound of cheese.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.726
EDITH: Otto would say we should
be grateful for what we have,

29:29.726 --> 29:33.188
so I will appeal
to my better nature.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.482
Come, lazy little lady,
help me make dinner.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.984
Miep has to get
ready for her party.

29:36.984 --> 29:41.113
MIEP: Oh, I'm already ready.
EDITH: You're not going in that?

29:42.197 --> 29:44.741
MIEP: Yeah?
EDITH: Absolutely not.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.951
Well, yeah.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.536
You, you, you
look elegant in this.

29:47.536 --> 29:48.787
MIEP: Yeah.
EDITH: You'll stand out.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.163
AUGUSTE: And no coat.
MIEP: What?

29:50.163 --> 29:51.957
No, it's, it's gonna
be outside, it's really cold.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.291
It's a skating party.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.668
AUGUSTE: I don't care.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.086
You aren't gonna cover
that gorgeous dress of Edith's

29:56.086 --> 29:57.546
with a heavy wool coat.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.339
Can you imagine?

29:59.339 --> 30:03.927
EDITH: Well, unless, um,
she wears, um, a short cape.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.390
AUGUSTE: I don't know
how you can even ask that.

30:08.390 --> 30:11.018
EDITH: Well, it, it would
go perfectly with the dress.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.602
AUGUSTE: You're
not taking that cape.

30:12.602 --> 30:15.230
My grandmother gave it to me.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.900
EDITH: I mean, she's wearing the
dress I wore to the opera ball.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.402
The fabric's from Paris.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.487
MIEP: What? This is way too
nice, I'm not wearing this.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.655
EDITH: Oh, you're wearing it.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.115
MIEP: No, no, no.
Mrs. Frank, I really.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.533
ANNE: You can't argue with
her when she has that face.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.951
You won't win.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.037
MARGOT: Yeah. You're wearing
that dress to the party.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.621
So gorgeous.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.791
MIEP: All right. All right!

30:37.210 --> 30:41.214
ANNE: Oh.
AUGUSTE: Anne, darling.

30:41.214 --> 30:45.343
Go in the trunk under
my bed and get the cape.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.720
ANNE: Okay.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.180
EDITH: It's hideous.
Take it off.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.347
MIEP: Oh.
AUGUSTE: See? It doesn't work.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.601
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:52.601 --> 30:55.020
Disaster.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.480
MIEP: What, this
is my best friend.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.023
She knows every
stitch of clothing I own.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.357
What I am gonna tell her?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.026
AUGUSTE: Well,
you'll have to lie.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.153
EDITH: Just, just say it's
cheap stuff, but it looks pricy.

31:03.153 --> 31:05.280
MIEP: Well, I'm
so bored of lying to her.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.949
I hate it.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.579
I'll lie to her.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.165
(laughing)

31:17.918 --> 31:21.755
AUGUSTE: Every time I
imagine beyond these rooms,

31:21.755 --> 31:25.008
our normal lives,
and that's every day,

31:25.008 --> 31:29.096
when I picture
seeing people in public,

31:30.263 --> 31:32.682
hugging my girlfriends,

31:32.682 --> 31:34.810
eating a meal in a restaurant,

31:34.810 --> 31:39.272
mailing a letter,
I am wearing that cape.

31:41.358 --> 31:45.570
When life is normal,
I am wearing that cape.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.699
Wear that cape
for me tonight, Miep.

31:49.699 --> 31:53.120
Take the girl
out into the world.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.956
MIEP: Thank you.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.086
There you are.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.004
JAN: So this is the place?

32:03.004 --> 32:05.173
Now I know what
she sees in this guy.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.591
MIEP: I thought
you weren't coming?

32:06.591 --> 32:07.843
JAN: I didn't know
that was an option.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.344
MIEP: Oh. You know what?

32:09.344 --> 32:11.721
It is. Just go home.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.140
JAN: I'm sorry.
MIEP: Oh, I'm serious!

32:13.140 --> 32:14.307
JAN: I know you
want this to be fun.

32:14.307 --> 32:17.102
MIEP: Just go, no,
I need this to be fun!

32:18.186 --> 32:20.647
I need to remember what Tess and
I were like before life was just

32:20.647 --> 32:23.275
one long list of
things to worry about.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.068
I need to remember what
you and I were like because

32:25.068 --> 32:28.363
I have no idea anymore.

32:28.363 --> 32:29.823
I just wanna go in
there for one night and

32:29.823 --> 32:31.867
just forget all
that is going on.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.785
I know that's selfish,
I know it is.

32:33.785 --> 32:38.290
But I just need to remember
that things were good so

32:38.290 --> 32:42.586
I can believe that they'll
be good when this is all over.

32:42.586 --> 32:45.380
And you can't, and
that's fine, honestly,

32:45.380 --> 32:47.757
I don't care, I don't mind.

32:47.757 --> 32:53.763
Just, just go home
so I can have fun.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.520
JAN: No. You look beautiful.

33:04.274 --> 33:08.653
MIEP: I know. Thank you.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.577
(doorbell)

33:16.161 --> 33:18.413
Oh, my God.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.583
JAN: Wow.
TESS: Miep! Hi!

33:21.583 --> 33:25.462
MIEP: Hi!
TESS: Oh, my gosh, hi!

33:25.462 --> 33:26.880
It's so good to see you guys!

33:26.880 --> 33:28.215
MIEP: Tess, this party is.
TESS: Isn't it just?

33:28.215 --> 33:30.091
Look at you!
You look adorable!

33:30.091 --> 33:31.635
Is this, is this swan feather?

33:31.635 --> 33:33.428
MIEP: It's gorgeous, isn't it?
And it was, it was my mom's.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.055
Here. And this.

33:36.389 --> 33:37.766
TESS: Come on. I'm so excited.

33:37.766 --> 33:40.018
MIEP: Wow. I mean,
this is insane!

33:40.018 --> 33:42.812
TESS: Isn't it? Did you ever
imagine it would be like this?

33:42.812 --> 33:44.773
MIEP: I mean, it's
absolutely incredible.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.191
TESS: Isn't it?
Isn't it amazing?

33:46.191 --> 33:47.234
MIEP: Where, where
is the skating, though?

33:47.234 --> 33:48.860
TESS: Oh, it's
all set up outside.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.654
I mean, the girls
aren't that into it, but
I'm sure the people...

33:50.654 --> 33:51.738
MIEP: The girls?

33:51.738 --> 33:52.989
TESS: Will go now
that you're here.

33:52.989 --> 33:53.907
Yes, the girls!
Oh, they can't wait to meet you?

33:53.907 --> 33:56.618
Where are they?
There! Let's go.

33:56.618 --> 33:59.621
Oh. Elke, Halle.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.248
This is Miep.

34:01.248 --> 34:02.540
ELKE: Hello.
MIEP: Hi!

34:02.540 --> 34:04.000
TESS: My best friend
since forever and kind of

34:04.000 --> 34:05.418
the inspiration for this party.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.379
MIEP: Oh, I don't know
about that, but it is our thing.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.005
We started it when
we were in school.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.633
ELKE: I love your necklace.
Are those butterflies?

34:11.633 --> 34:13.009
HALLE: Where did you get it?

34:13.009 --> 34:15.512
MIEP: Oh, actually, it
was a gift from this one, here.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.098
HALLE: Tess, I hate you,
your taste is so perfect.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.392
TESS: Oh, stop.
ELKE: Tess says you make jam.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.643
MIEP: Oh, um, I sell it.

34:21.643 --> 34:22.978
And it's not jam, it's pectin,

34:22.978 --> 34:25.397
which is what you
use to thicken jam.

34:26.564 --> 34:29.776
HALLE: I love jam.
MIEP: Really? That's great.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.987
HALLE: That's, yes.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.155
MIEP: And, Tess, where,
where is everyone?

34:34.155 --> 34:35.490
Where are all the old.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.075
TESS: Yeah.
I told you, Kat was a no.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.619
MIEP: Yeah, but Helen,
Leni, oh I don't...

34:39.619 --> 34:42.580
TESS: You still
speak to Helen and Leni?

34:42.998 --> 34:45.542
JAN: Two champagnes, please.

34:48.461 --> 34:52.257
PETER: Seriously?
DANIEL: Oh, really?

34:53.842 --> 34:57.512
JAN: And a, uh, large scotch.
Thank you.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.431
DANIEL: You know, um, it, it's
actually not that complicated

34:59.431 --> 35:00.890
to reconfigure a plant.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.560
Um, we like to think that, uh,
these personnel trucks

35:03.560 --> 35:06.021
they're kind of just
delivery trucks.

35:06.021 --> 35:09.107
But, um, these, uh, these tank
contracts they're talking about.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.027
Gies! You made it!

35:12.861 --> 35:14.571
Nice to see you make an effort.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.282
Thank you very much.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.284
Yeah, sorry, uh,
this is, uh, Peter.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.577
PETER: Pleased to meet you.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.245
DANIEL: Uh, you
should come meet everyone.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.706
JAN: Yes.
Uh, I'll be right over, yeah.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.708

auto parts business, so yeah.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.705
We have some contracts.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.916

are tearing apart our country?

38:12.916 --> 38:14.959
Relocating Jewish people,
killing them.

We are rebelling in our own

44:06.310 --> 44:09.897
Mr. Frank, why?
You're scaring me.

44:20.241 --> 44:23.369
OTTO: My mother's friend had one
during the inquisition when Jews

44:23.369 --> 44:26.539
had to convert to
Christianity or be killed.

44:26.539 --> 44:29.333

definitely wouldn't know.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.324
I don't, I don't want it.

45:01.324 --> 45:02.533
I don't want to have it.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.951

MIEP: No!

45:17.673 --> 45:18.758

I want you to talk to me.
I wanna be enough.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.973
JAN: I'm not going to church.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.893
I'm doing what you're doing.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.145
MIEP: What are
you talking about?

45:31.145 --> 45:33.689
JAN: You said yes to Mr. Frank.

45:33.689 --> 45:36.150
I said yes, too.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.526
MIEP: What?

45:37.526 --> 45:39.028
Wait, you're hiding people.

45:39.028 --> 45:40.529
JAN: I'm doing things.

45:40.529 --> 45:41.906
Okay, I'm, I'm helping.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.242
I can't tell you more than that.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.327
MIEP: Jan, no, we said no more.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.913
JAN: No, no, were you not
paying any attention in there?

45:48.913 --> 45:51.082
Those people
have lost everything,

45:51.082 --> 45:53.918
and still they resist.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.922
And I have to resist, too.

45:57.922 --> 46:00.758
I have to.

46:12.812 --> 46:14.230
DANIEL: Wait, wait. No, no, no.

46:14.230 --> 46:15.314
Please, I got, I got
some really important to say.

46:15.314 --> 46:16.774
TESS: Oh, really? What's that?

46:16.774 --> 46:17.942
DANIEL: I think you should stay.

46:17.942 --> 46:19.735
TESS: No.
DANIEL: Oh, please, no, no.

46:19.735 --> 46:23.531
No, please, no. Please, no.

46:23.531 --> 46:27.076
(laughing)

46:28.786 --> 46:31.038
MIEP: Tess, the
necklace you gave me.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.498
Where did you get it from?

46:32.498 --> 46:35.126
TESS: What? Why?
MIEP: Just answer me.

46:35.126 --> 46:37.378
TESS: You're being weird
and dramatic and I'm tired.

46:37.378 --> 46:40.131
MIEP: Answer me.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.300
TESS: Someone Daniel
knows was selling jewelry.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.885
MIEP: It was stolen from a Jew.
TESS: What?

46:44.885 --> 46:47.096
MIEP: The Nazis are
stealing from Jews.

46:47.096 --> 46:48.848
TESS: Oh, my God, Miep.

46:48.848 --> 46:50.266
It's so late.

46:50.266 --> 46:51.475
MIEP: They're killing people.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.852
TESS: Daniel
isn't killing people.

46:52.852 --> 46:54.395
MIEP: He's not a
good person, Tess.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.856
He's not, he's
doing business with them.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.858
He's not bothered
by what they're doing.

46:58.858 --> 47:00.443
TESS: How would you know?

47:00.443 --> 47:02.903
You haven't even
bothered to get to know him.

47:02.903 --> 47:05.156
This is what we have
to do to get by now, Miep.

47:05.156 --> 47:08.492
We have to do
business with the Nazis.

47:08.492 --> 47:11.037
What are we supposed to do?

47:11.037 --> 47:13.622
MIEP: What?

47:13.622 --> 47:16.584
What are we supposed to do?

47:16.584 --> 47:18.669
Anything, Tess.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.922
These people are evil.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.716
Come on, look at me.

47:23.716 --> 47:26.719
You're a good person.

47:26.719 --> 47:29.680
TESS: My mother is dying, Miep.

47:29.680 --> 47:33.809
And when she's gone,
I'll be all alone.

47:33.809 --> 47:36.645
Daniel is all I've got.

47:36.645 --> 47:38.981
MIEP: You're wrong. You have me.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.733
TESS: Do I?

47:40.733 --> 47:42.860
Because you're
not around anymore.

47:42.860 --> 47:48.407
MIEP: Tess, leave him.
Leave him, please, please.

47:48.407 --> 47:51.494
TESS: I'm just one person, Miep.

47:51.494 --> 47:53.662
My leaving Daniel
isn't gonna stop the war.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.206
It's not gonna change anything.

47:55.206 --> 47:58.000
MIEP: It will change you.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.336
It will remind
you what is right.

48:00.336 --> 48:04.090
TESS: And what are you doing
to help besides judging me?

48:06.092 --> 48:09.220
You know what?
I just want you to go.

48:09.220 --> 48:12.223
Please, just leave.

48:12.681 --> 48:16.811
MIEP: Tess, please.
TESS: Please, Miep, just go.

48:20.981 --> 48:26.445
MIEP: You know, one day
this war is going to end,

48:28.739 --> 48:31.992
then you're gonna have
to live with yourself.
