00:15.417 --> 00:17.980
No, oh, yeah, I will.
I'm just finishin' me beer.

00:18.083 --> 00:20.531
- Just let me finish me beer.
- No, get out. I told you.

00:20.635 --> 00:23.729
I fuckin' told you. Hey!
You've had enough.

00:23.833 --> 00:26.375
You've had e-bloody-nough.
Now, come on. Get out.

00:26.479 --> 00:31.596
- Brownie, I promise. I promise I'll be good.
- No, get out! Beat it! Out now!

00:31.700 --> 00:35.438
You've had enough.
You've had enough. Come on! Get out!

00:35.542 --> 00:38.792
Tell him who spilled it! I didn't even
spill it! Simmo, you weak prick!

00:38.896 --> 00:43.309
- Dougie! Dougie!
- Hands off the merchandise!

00:43.414 --> 00:46.958
- Dougie, you're barred!
- Fuck, Brownie!

00:47.063 --> 00:49.991
- Yeah, alright. Just go home.
- Brownie!

00:50.095 --> 00:52.854
Dougie! I don't want to see
your ugly mug around here again.

00:52.958 --> 00:54.729
Come on, come on. He'll get over it.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.729
He's got the long haul
to Adelaide tomorrow.

00:56.833 --> 00:58.521
He's just shitty.

00:58.625 --> 01:02.063
Lucky I don't leave
a piss ring on your carpet!

01:02.167 --> 01:04.104
Come on. Come on, shut up.

01:04.208 --> 01:07.396
Wouldn't even know
there was a piss ring on your carpet!

01:07.500 --> 01:11.042
Hey, Rexie. Hey, where's Rexie going?

01:11.146 --> 01:14.281
- Rexie!
- See you, boys!

01:15.417 --> 01:16.729
Come on.

01:16.833 --> 01:20.730
- Let's go to the Workers' Club.
- Nah, he's barred from there as well.

01:43.563 --> 01:46.385
<i>When you walked into the room</i>

01:47.844 --> 01:51.876
<i>There was voodoo in the vibes</i>

01:55.021 --> 01:59.188
<i>I was captured by your style</i>

01:59.292 --> 02:03.983
<i>But I could not catch your eyes</i>

02:06.396 --> 02:10.750
<i>Now I stand here helplessly</i>

02:10.854 --> 02:13.615
<i>Hoping you get into me</i>

02:13.719 --> 02:16.459
<i>I am so into you</i>

02:18.031 --> 02:21.661
<i>I can't think of nothing else</i>

02:25.219 --> 02:28.729
<i>I am so into you</i>

02:29.385 --> 02:33.323
<i>I can't think of nothing else</i>

02:33.583 --> 02:37.740
<i>Thinking how it's gonna be</i>

02:37.844 --> 02:40.829
<i>Whenever I get you next to me</i>

02:42.156 --> 02:45.146
<i>It's gonna be good</i>

02:45.250 --> 02:47.556
<i>Don't you know?</i>

02:47.660 --> 02:50.437
<i>From your head to your toe</i>

02:50.542 --> 02:53.607
<i>Gonna love you all over</i>

02:53.711 --> 02:56.419
<i>Over and over...</i>

03:01.073 --> 03:02.936
Rex!

03:05.906 --> 03:07.999
Rex!

03:11.073 --> 03:12.901
Rex!

03:13.625 --> 03:15.938
- Morning, Pol.
- You!

03:16.042 --> 03:18.490
You've been dumping
your rubbish in my bin!

03:18.594 --> 03:20.615
I don't want your rubbish, mate!

03:20.719 --> 03:24.823
You keep it in your own bin, and if you
don't have no room in your own bin,

03:24.927 --> 03:27.531
you'll keep it in your fucking house!

03:27.635 --> 03:30.425
I'm not the bloody tip!

03:34.740 --> 03:36.698
You finished?

03:36.802 --> 03:40.552
And you keep that mangy
bloody dog of yours

03:40.656 --> 03:43.260
on your side of the street.

03:43.365 --> 03:47.760
Yesterday, I come out and that big
bloody Alsatian from next door

03:47.865 --> 03:50.944
was chock-a-block up him!

03:53.594 --> 03:55.344
Would have been a sight.

03:55.448 --> 03:59.374
Looked like it was trying
to shake a possum off a pole!

04:11.177 --> 04:13.509
How you feeling?

04:14.427 --> 04:16.851
Can't keep my food down.

04:17.594 --> 04:21.927
I reckon it's that fisherman's basket
they serve you up at the All Nations.

04:22.031 --> 04:26.427
My Uncle Cyril used to say never,
ever order seafood in this town.

04:26.531 --> 04:28.927
We're 500 miles from the ocean.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.378
I'm getting old, Pol.

04:33.698 --> 04:36.665
We all getting old, Rex.

04:36.927 --> 04:40.935
These days, I can't remember
ever being young.

04:41.552 --> 04:46.435
My Uncle Cyril used to say if you were
born in this town, you were born old.

04:48.198 --> 04:51.198
Your Uncle Cyril used to say a lot.

04:51.302 --> 04:53.946
Couldn't shut the bastard up.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.450
Oh, dear.

05:01.531 --> 05:06.055
- You didn't come around last night.
- Oh, I left it a bit late.

05:06.552 --> 05:08.988
Might tonight, hey?

05:11.010 --> 05:14.615
- 43 today, they reckon.
- Hotter yesterday.

05:14.719 --> 05:16.613
Yeah.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.945
Morning, Rex.

05:41.115 --> 05:44.104
The cousin and his mob still coming down
for the school holidays?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.729
Nup. Too bloody many of them.

05:47.563 --> 05:50.375
Useless mob of no-good bludgers.

05:50.479 --> 05:52.750
Bloody mad, the whole lot of them.

05:52.854 --> 05:57.521
Swimming in a river with no water,
driving round in a car with no fuel.

05:57.833 --> 06:00.688
"When can we come
and see you, Aunty Polly?"

06:00.792 --> 06:04.808
"When hell freezes over, Noel,
that's when!"

06:06.313 --> 06:08.727
Okay, dog.

06:09.229 --> 06:12.375
Shit, shower and shove off.

06:12.479 --> 06:14.373
Come on.

06:33.870 --> 06:36.134
Gday, Col!

06:44.083 --> 06:47.426
- Morning, Mrs Peter.
- Good morning, Rex.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.563
- Have a good one, Mrs Peter.
- Thank you.

07:14.313 --> 07:19.229
- Rexie. What do you know?
- Not enough, Dougie. Not enough.

07:19.333 --> 07:23.111
Correct. You may pass.

07:34.325 --> 07:36.563
Hey, Rexie.

07:37.292 --> 07:39.882
Sexy Rexie.

08:00.042 --> 08:02.428
See you at the pub, hey?

08:03.375 --> 08:05.375
Good man.

08:17.729 --> 08:21.886
- How you going, Rexie?
- Can't complain.

08:23.833 --> 08:26.118
Polly alright?

08:26.761 --> 08:29.479
Well, she's good, I suppose, darl.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.143
You'd have to ask her.

08:51.521 --> 08:54.313
- Rex MacRae.
- Yeah.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.104
Apart from the lymphatic system,

08:57.208 --> 09:02.688
these dark areas show it's moved through
into the liver and several other organs.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.083
Multiple cannonball lesions
here on the lungs.

09:06.188 --> 09:09.100
We didn't get it all, Rex. I'm sorry.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.471
How long?

09:19.021 --> 09:21.979
Well... it's extremely well advanced.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.242
Three months.

09:24.854 --> 09:26.820
At best.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.242
There you go, then.

09:35.854 --> 09:38.296
If we'd got it earlier...

09:39.833 --> 09:41.783
If.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.684
"If wishes were horses,
beggars would ride."

09:48.979 --> 09:50.746
Dad used to say that.

10:00.875 --> 10:04.438
So, Rex, we're gonna have to look
at hospital as an option.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.833
No.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.854
We have a brand-new
palliative care ward...

10:07.958 --> 10:10.408
No fuckin' hospitals.

10:10.833 --> 10:14.250
Eventually... you won't have a choice.

10:14.354 --> 10:16.604
I'm a cab driver, Doc.

10:16.708 --> 10:18.271
That's what I am.

10:18.375 --> 10:23.294
So I'm gonna drive my cab
until I can't drive it anymore.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.271
That's it.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.637
Finished.

10:29.375 --> 10:32.242
You can help me out, can't you?

10:33.479 --> 10:35.583
Put me down when the time comes?

10:35.688 --> 10:38.437
I give you my word there will be no pain.

10:38.542 --> 10:41.554
No fuckin' hospitals!

10:43.667 --> 10:45.300
Okay.

10:46.271 --> 10:50.184
Okay. And you're right.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.352
Take some time. It's...

10:54.750 --> 10:56.708
It's a lot to think about.

10:56.812 --> 10:59.826
Let's talk again in three days, okay?

11:32.167 --> 11:35.833
Rexie! How is ya, fella?

11:35.938 --> 11:37.875
Dougie. Col.

11:37.979 --> 11:41.347
Little birdie told me
it was your shout, Rex.

11:41.729 --> 11:44.195
Fuck that little birdie.

11:45.833 --> 11:50.354
- Evening, Rex. Still single?
- Still single, Frank.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.500
Brothers, my brothers!

11:52.604 --> 11:57.425
There was much rejoicing in the land,
for there was no spillage.

11:57.529 --> 11:59.229
Hey?

12:00.313 --> 12:02.250
Not a drop. Hey, hey, hey!

12:03.083 --> 12:05.938
Dougie, where's my beer?
It's your shout, you little weasel.

12:06.042 --> 12:08.646
No, Rex has got them, you stupid bastard.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.604
Coming up.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.667
- How is ya' Rexie?
- Can't complain, Simmo.

12:13.771 --> 12:17.167
Oh, God, you're a legend!

12:17.280 --> 12:19.688
- Thanks, Rex.
- Here's to us and fuck the rest.

12:19.792 --> 12:21.354
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.163
Frank?

12:24.958 --> 12:27.917
- What's news, Col?
- Oh, not much.

12:28.021 --> 12:31.646
Still this euthanasia thing up in
the Territory, although now it's official.

12:31.854 --> 12:35.688
So if you know for sure you're gonna
cark it and you reckon you've had enough,

12:35.792 --> 12:38.167
you can just ask them
to put you out of your misery.

12:38.271 --> 12:42.646
Jesus. Pass that law in Broken Hill,
the-red be no bastards left!

12:43.583 --> 12:45.896
I'm hearing ya.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.354
Hey, Simmo.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.188
Tell Rex about our plan.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.625
Come on. Hey.
Rex, he's gonna make us millionaires.

12:55.729 --> 12:59.083
Hey? Go on, tell him. It's brilliant.

12:59.188 --> 13:03.158
Well, we're thinking of going into
partnership. Open up a restaurant.

13:03.262 --> 13:06.208
Wait till you hear this.
This is rolled fucking gold, mate.

13:06.313 --> 13:09.952
We're not gonna serve the same old crap
you get everywhere else. No, no, no.

13:10.056 --> 13:13.552
This will be an offal restaurant.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.604
That stuff your mum used
to make you eat. Liver. Kidney.

13:17.708 --> 13:20.891
- Brains. Tongue.
- Tongue!

13:20.995 --> 13:22.448
Tripe. That sort of thing.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.521
Simmo's even thought
of a name for it, haven't you?

13:26.146 --> 13:29.563
- Offally Good.
- Oh, you dozy little prick!

13:31.583 --> 13:33.083
He's offally clumsy today!

13:33.188 --> 13:35.479
- I bloody warned you!
- This is me good gear!

13:35.583 --> 13:38.104
- Calm down.
- I haven't done nothing.

13:38.208 --> 13:41.521
- I said fuckin' calm down!
- Don't be offally rude.

13:45.208 --> 13:49.896
I'd like the number
for a Dr Farmer. In Darwin.

13:50.104 --> 13:52.438
Yeah, it's...

13:54.313 --> 13:56.445
Nicole.

13:56.549 --> 14:00.976
Yep. Well, she must be.
I'm looking at her photo in the paper.

14:01.521 --> 14:04.042
Could I have the number
of the Darwin Hospital, please?

14:04.146 --> 14:09.073
I'd like to speak to...
Does she work at the hospital there?

14:11.833 --> 14:12.854
Yeah.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.747
Hold on. Give it to me.

14:24.333 --> 14:27.250
<i>Hello. This is Dr Nicole Farmer's surgery.</i>

14:27.354 --> 14:30.104
<i>I'm not available right now,
but please leave a message.</i>

14:30.208 --> 14:33.853
<i>In case of emergency, call 000.</i>

14:35.729 --> 14:37.688
<i>Hello.</i>

14:38.640 --> 14:40.229
<i>My name is Rex.</i>

14:40.542 --> 14:44.042
It's not short for anything, it's just...

14:44.146 --> 14:46.075
Rex.

14:46.438 --> 14:49.125
I live in Broken Hill.

14:49.229 --> 14:51.123
But...

14:53.000 --> 14:54.396
I'm dying.

14:54.708 --> 14:57.616
<i>And I think you could help.</i>

14:59.208 --> 15:02.181
<i>My number is 08...</i>

15:02.285 --> 15:07.183
8087-3666.

15:08.354 --> 15:11.032
I know Darwin's a long way...

16:51.375 --> 16:53.823
What are you doing up?

16:55.583 --> 16:57.333
It's morning.

16:57.438 --> 16:59.995
Tea's still brewing!

17:06.541 --> 17:09.368
I made some scones last night.

17:09.979 --> 17:12.540
They turned out alright!

17:41.083 --> 17:43.841
Airport, thanks. Going to Adelaide.

17:56.438 --> 17:58.125
Turn that shit off.

18:00.648 --> 18:03.176
I'm trying to call my wife.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.208
<i>It's a basic human right, Simon...</i>

18:08.520 --> 18:10.875
Out of range?

18:12.188 --> 18:14.833
We're in the middle of fuckin' town.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.313
- You live here?
- Only all my life.

18:20.833 --> 18:25.640
Heaven for ya. I'm flying home
for good week after next.

18:25.744 --> 18:29.833
<i>Of course I can, Simon.
But it's just that. Fear.</i>

18:29.938 --> 18:32.021
Can't get away from this shit
even if you try.

18:32.125 --> 18:35.333
- Hey!
- <i>You will die.</i>

18:35.437 --> 18:38.938
<i>Surely the big question is not
whether we'll die, but how we die.</i>

18:39.042 --> 18:41.929
<i>Well, let's see if our listeners agree.
Time to take some calls.</i>

18:42.033 --> 18:45.563
<i>1800-500-260.</i>

18:45.667 --> 18:47.021
<i>Are you there, Terry?</i>

18:47.125 --> 18:51.354
<i>And we've got time for just one
more caller. Rex in Broken Hill.</i>

18:51.458 --> 18:53.208
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Rex.</i>

18:53.313 --> 18:57.062
<i>I left a message on your machine.
You didn't call me back.</i>

18:57.271 --> 19:00.646
- <i>What's your question, Rex?</i>
- Well, I'm crook.

19:01.271 --> 19:03.062
Real crook.

19:03.167 --> 19:06.375
- <i>And I'm not gonna get any better.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry to hear that, Rex.</i>

19:06.479 --> 19:10.625
You're looking for a volunteer,
aren't you? To be first, right?

19:10.729 --> 19:15.688
<i>Rex, I'd need to know
so much more about your situation.</i>

19:15.792 --> 19:17.542
I've got stomach cancer.

19:17.646 --> 19:21.447
<i>They cut out half my gut a while back,
but they didn't get it all, so...</i>

19:23.021 --> 19:25.063
So, what else do you need to know?

19:25.375 --> 19:28.583
<i>Well, you'd need to speak first
with your family.</i>

19:28.688 --> 19:29.979
<i>I haven't got any.</i>

19:30.083 --> 19:33.333
<i>I think the doctor means
those closest to you, Rex.</i>

19:33.438 --> 19:35.908
There's no-one else.

19:36.854 --> 19:38.833
It's just me.

19:38.938 --> 19:41.070
Any time this century?

19:41.174 --> 19:43.021
So do I come to you or do you come to me?

19:43.125 --> 19:46.688
- <i>It's not that simple.</i>
- Well, it's legal now, right?

19:46.792 --> 19:50.167
<i>Well, the Northern Territory
Government has passed the bill.</i>

19:50.271 --> 19:52.604
Well, I guess I'll have to come to you.

19:53.333 --> 19:57.708
<i>Okay. Slow down.
This isn't the right time.</i>

19:57.813 --> 20:01.146
<i>We might have to leave it there anyway,
folks.</i> <i>It's coming up to news time here.</i>

20:01.250 --> 20:05.454
<i>Thanks for your call, Rex.
Thanks, Dr Farmer. It's news time.</i>

20:13.354 --> 20:15.222
Come on.

20:33.563 --> 20:35.847
Come on, mate.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.188
Anything in the papers, Col?

20:58.292 --> 21:01.771
Oh, yeah. There's... You know, there's...

21:01.875 --> 21:03.804
stuff.

21:06.938 --> 21:11.085
- Stuff?
- Yeah. Stuff.

21:15.750 --> 21:19.885
Rex, we heard you. The whole
bloody world must have heard you.

21:21.438 --> 21:24.979
Darwin? What do you think
you're doing, hey?

21:25.188 --> 21:27.458
Who do you think you are?
Joan of fuckin' Arc?

21:27.563 --> 21:30.620
It's too bloody weird, mate.
It's not natural.

21:30.724 --> 21:33.545
Boys... I'm dying.

21:33.649 --> 21:36.292
Oh, Jesus, Rex. You are not fucking dying.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.188
You're sitting here
having a beer with your mates.

21:39.292 --> 21:42.875
My Uncle Jack had cancer
for fuckin' years.

21:43.396 --> 21:48.802
Used to dance around the living
room singing. Cancer, cancer...

21:53.396 --> 21:55.146
Hey.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.688
Yeah, well, my grandad
had cancer of the bum.

21:57.792 --> 22:01.174
He said that was okay. He reckoned
Grandma was a bigger pain in the arse.

22:05.604 --> 22:08.938
Everyone gets cancer. Fuckin' everyone.

22:09.042 --> 22:12.404
You'll be right, Rexie.
We'll look after you here.

22:12.508 --> 22:14.979
Darwin's a long way, mate. A long way.

22:15.083 --> 22:18.192
Give the boys a round, Stella.
On the house.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.420
Hey?

22:19.524 --> 22:22.716
Me ears! Something's happened to me ears!

22:24.167 --> 22:27.446
So, this is what it's like inside?

22:28.333 --> 22:32.104
Not much, is it?
You made it sound special.

22:33.354 --> 22:36.042
- Polly...
- Don't you say a word, Frank Brown!

22:36.146 --> 22:39.831
I know you don't serve blackfellas
in here, do ya?

22:40.729 --> 22:44.354
Well, don't worry.
I'm not asking you to start now.

22:50.833 --> 22:53.139
Is it true?

23:25.458 --> 23:27.792
Want a beer?

23:27.896 --> 23:30.080
Why not?

23:48.583 --> 23:51.110
You packed your mum up.

23:56.563 --> 23:59.166
Are you really gonna do this?

24:06.958 --> 24:10.771
- How are you gonna get there?
- I'm gonna drive.

24:10.875 --> 24:15.333
- It's 3,000 kilometres!
- I do that in the cab every week.

24:15.438 --> 24:19.125
Jesus, Rex. You've never left
Broken Hill in your life!

24:19.229 --> 24:22.140
Yeah. I know.

24:24.125 --> 24:28.616
- What you got here?
- Oh, just some old photos.

24:35.979 --> 24:40.282
Don't think I'm gonna stop being angry
at you just 'cause you put Livvie on.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.532
Worth a try.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.702
Mum tried to get to Darwin once.

24:52.729 --> 24:56.030
Said she'd never seen the sea.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.455
- Did she?
- No.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.292
Got close.

25:02.708 --> 25:05.427
Made it all the way to Daly Waters.

25:05.531 --> 25:09.079
Used to be an air force base
there during the war.

25:10.646 --> 25:13.229
That's where she met Dad.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.708
He was a looker.

25:15.813 --> 25:18.205
Mum thought so too.

25:18.917 --> 25:22.108
So she gave him a little present.

25:23.604 --> 25:25.429
Me.

25:26.854 --> 25:30.954
Anyway, 'cause of that,
she had to go back to Broken Hill.

25:31.813 --> 25:33.979
Dad stayed and built the airfield.

25:34.813 --> 25:38.827
Promised he'd come back to her
when it was all over.

25:40.313 --> 25:42.623
And he did.

25:43.896 --> 25:46.581
Back to a family he didn't know.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.754
To a place he didn't want to be.

25:54.854 --> 26:00.176
Look at 'em. I can't remember
ever seeing them that happy, Pol.

26:01.583 --> 26:03.507
Ever.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.411
How come you never told me that before?

26:07.833 --> 26:10.367
You never asked.

26:19.271 --> 26:21.143
Rex!

26:22.979 --> 26:24.924
Rex!

26:26.604 --> 26:29.042
- Take me with you.
- No.

26:29.146 --> 26:31.539
Listen to me!

26:32.271 --> 26:34.813
I will hold your hand.

26:35.021 --> 26:40.229
- I will clean your mess.
- Oh, you hate mess, Pol!

26:40.333 --> 26:43.500
You told me so a thousand times.

26:43.604 --> 26:46.765
And it doesn't get any messier
than a black woman

26:46.869 --> 26:51.560
holding the hand of a dying whitefella
who can't even wipe his own arse!

26:54.021 --> 26:56.538
We had some fun.

26:57.146 --> 26:59.532
On the sly.

27:00.250 --> 27:04.400
The cab driver
and his gin across the road.

27:04.792 --> 27:08.534
But that's it now. Finished!

27:19.417 --> 27:22.415
Miserable old bastard!

29:05.146 --> 29:08.030
I left some stuff for you inside.

30:10.792 --> 30:12.998
Oh, Rex.

30:14.063 --> 30:16.224
You stupid bastard.

30:17.396 --> 30:20.542
You stupid, stupid, bastard.

30:20.646 --> 30:23.699
Yeah, so... so, when are you thinking?

30:23.803 --> 30:25.780
But that's tomorrow!

30:25.884 --> 30:28.882
Then I'll have to fly back to Sydney.

30:29.313 --> 30:31.722
Oh, look, hang on, would you?

30:31.826 --> 30:35.167
- Dr Farmer.
- Hi, Doc. It's me. Rex.

30:35.271 --> 30:38.818
Rex! I'll call you back.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.417
I have been calling that number
you left me, Rex, but...

30:42.521 --> 30:44.396
<i>I'm about two hours out of Broken Hill.</i>

30:44.500 --> 30:47.271
About to cut across country,
through the Flinders Ranges,

30:47.375 --> 30:50.313
hit the Oodnadatta Track,
then straight up the guts to you.

30:50.417 --> 30:54.146
You're driving?
But, Rex, we haven't even...

30:54.250 --> 30:58.563
- Where do I find you when I get to Darwin?
- Hang on a sec. Sonja!

30:58.667 --> 31:01.271
- <i>Do you have a pen?</i>
- Yep. Hold on.

31:01.688 --> 31:05.032
- It's 238... Bagot Road.
- <i>Yeah. Bagot Road.</i>

31:05.136 --> 31:08.083
- Casuarina.
- Casuarina.

31:08.292 --> 31:10.313
You're really driving, Rex?

31:10.417 --> 31:12.833
Yeah. Should see you
in four or five days, I reckon.

31:12.938 --> 31:15.688
Wait, Rex. Could you please call me?

31:15.792 --> 31:19.688
Just let me know
where you are and... and, Rex?

31:20.208 --> 31:23.971
- Keep your fluids up.
- Right.

31:26.768 --> 31:28.574
Jesus.

31:29.667 --> 31:32.250
Call that bloke from The Territorian.

31:32.354 --> 31:36.449
I think we might finally have
a story for him.

31:43.354 --> 31:46.010
Keep your fluids up.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.271
<i>It's Aussie-made, recyclable, weatherproof
and guaranteed for five years.</i>

34:13.375 --> 34:17.562
<i>Log on now for a special offer
at easyline.com.au.</i>

34:17.667 --> 34:21.896
<i>Welcome back. We're having a chat with
right-to-die campaigner Dr Nicole Farmer.</i>

34:22.000 --> 34:27.489
<i>Dr Farmer, tell us about this machine
you've developed. It sounds scary.</i>

34:27.592 --> 34:30.146
<i>No, Tom. No, it's not scary at all.</i>

34:30.250 --> 34:34.000
<i>It's just a laptop computer
attached to a simple machine.</i>

34:34.103 --> 34:38.293
- <i>How exactly does it work?</i>
- <i>Well, perhaps I could show you, Kylie.</i>

34:38.397 --> 34:42.187
<i>Could you give me your arm? There we go.</i>

34:42.292 --> 34:45.271
<i>So, the computer speaks to the machine,</i>

34:45.375 --> 34:47.771
<i>which is attached
to the cannula in your arm.</i>

34:47.875 --> 34:51.458
<i>Now, here we have
a lethal dose of pentobarbital.</i>

34:51.562 --> 34:53.853
<i>But the plunger can only be activated</i>

34:53.958 --> 34:57.021
<i>after the patient has answered yes
to three simple questions,</i>

34:57.125 --> 35:00.042
<i>which will appear here
on the screen of the computer.</i>

35:00.146 --> 35:03.365
<i>Okay, so, why the machine?
Why not just ask the questions yourself?</i>

35:03.469 --> 35:04.927
<i>It's a safeguard for the patient.</i>

35:05.083 --> 35:09.688
<i>It means that the final decision
is the patient's and the patient's alone.</i>

35:09.792 --> 35:13.208
- <i>So, are you ready, Kylie?</i>
- <i>I think so. I'm a little scared.</i>

35:13.313 --> 35:17.445
<i>Sure you want to do this?
We've only just... renewed your contract.</i>

35:19.125 --> 35:24.100
- <i>So, first question.</i>
- <i>"Do you wish to proceed?"</i>

35:24.708 --> 35:26.167
<i>Second question.</i>

35:26.271 --> 35:30.104
<i>"Do you understand that
if you proceed, you will die?"</i>

35:30.208 --> 35:32.250
<i>And the third question.</i>

35:32.354 --> 35:37.250
<i>"In 15 seconds, you will receive
a lethal injection and you will die.</i>

35:37.354 --> 35:41.229
<i>"Do you wish to proceed?
'Yes' press the space bar."</i>

35:43.167 --> 35:45.506
<i>I'm sorry. I don't think
I can... I'm sorry.</i>

35:45.610 --> 35:49.313
<i>Kylie. That's a perfectly normal reaction.</i>

35:49.417 --> 35:51.229
- <i>Can I just have some water?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

35:51.333 --> 35:53.521
<i>Perhaps we'd better take a break</i>

35:53.625 --> 35:57.313
<i>and give Kylie some time to recover
from her near-death experience.</i>

35:57.417 --> 36:01.794
<i>After the break, toenails...
what they can tell you about yourself.</i>

36:02.104 --> 36:04.479
"Open". "Open".

36:04.583 --> 36:07.288
"Open? "Open".

37:07.271 --> 37:08.642
Fuck!

37:29.792 --> 37:32.386
What the fuck is that?

38:18.833 --> 38:22.665
You want to keep cool, bro,
you should've just...

38:22.769 --> 38:25.361
turned that air conditioner on.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.803
You work here?

38:30.688 --> 38:33.625
I'll fix your windscreen, no worries.

38:39.104 --> 38:42.292
Leave your keys in there
and go inside, old man.

38:42.396 --> 38:46.935
Have a cold beer. She'll be good
as new when you come back out.

38:50.917 --> 38:54.302
My name's Tilly. What's yours?

38:56.792 --> 38:59.938
- Rex.
- Don't worry, Rex.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.617
I'll look after ya.

39:13.063 --> 39:15.221
Gday.

39:17.625 --> 39:21.354
- Give us a Coopers, love.
- Okay. How's the track today?

39:21.458 --> 39:24.496
Oh, lost my windscreen just out of Maree.

39:25.354 --> 39:28.729
Young fella who works next door... Tilly?

39:29.042 --> 39:32.458
- He's fitting me another one.
- He doesn't work here.

39:32.562 --> 39:36.298
He came up from Oodnadatta last night
to get on the turps with his cousin.

39:36.402 --> 39:41.042
Oh, don't worry. Might be a pisshead,
but he can fix just about anything.

39:41.146 --> 39:44.688
- How much will it cost?
- Dunno. A couple of hundred.

39:44.792 --> 39:46.333
You'd better give it to me, though.

39:46.438 --> 39:49.698
Well, he'll charge you four
and he owes me twice that.

39:50.958 --> 39:53.267
Good on ya.

39:56.521 --> 39:58.757
Feral cats.

40:00.146 --> 40:04.308
- Why do they string 'em up?
- 'Cause they don't belong here.

40:06.188 --> 40:08.814
We'd be fucked without that tree.

40:08.918 --> 40:13.792
- It's the only reason people come here.
- Well, they haven't got a lot of choice.

40:13.896 --> 40:16.528
They've got to refuel.

40:17.708 --> 40:20.979
It's the only thing worth
putting on a postcard, though.

40:21.083 --> 40:24.091
Well, they could put you on a postcard.

40:24.875 --> 40:27.740
Would you buy a postcard with me on it?

40:29.104 --> 40:32.037
We'd be fucked without that tree.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.383
Looks good.

40:45.488 --> 40:48.396
Yeah. That's him.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.450
I...

40:51.646 --> 40:53.875
I paid the barmaid.

40:53.979 --> 40:55.063
- Faith?
- Yeah.

40:55.167 --> 40:58.646
- How much?
- $200. She said you owed her.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.813
Oh, fuck it!

41:00.917 --> 41:03.684
Mother, father, dog!

41:06.354 --> 41:08.903
I'll tell you what, Rex.

41:09.792 --> 41:12.229
I'll do you a deal.

41:12.333 --> 41:15.521
You drop me off up the road in Oodnadatta,

41:15.938 --> 41:20.184
we square. Okay?

41:32.896 --> 41:35.137
Good job, that.

41:37.417 --> 41:40.101
Fitted solid, unna?

41:40.292 --> 41:42.725
Let's hope so.

41:43.938 --> 41:46.437
You know I was gonna play
for Essendon, Rex?

41:46.542 --> 41:50.438
- Oh, yeah?
- No bullshit. I was drafted.

41:50.542 --> 41:53.583
Best full-forward
in the history of Oodnadatta.

41:53.688 --> 41:57.250
- I met Michael Long.
- Yep?

41:57.771 --> 41:58.937
What happened?

41:59.042 --> 42:01.854
Well, they had my ticket booked
and everything.

42:02.375 --> 42:05.000
But Sally... that's my wife...

42:05.104 --> 42:07.417
she had Lionel... that's my boy...

42:07.521 --> 42:09.396
the night before I'm supposed to go!

42:09.500 --> 42:12.771
So I got to stay and look after
family, you know?

42:13.604 --> 42:16.825
Think you might try it again sometime?

42:18.958 --> 42:23.508
Lionel nearly three now.
Plus, we got little Jimmy.

42:23.750 --> 42:27.938
There's this mob up in Darwin.
They reckon they still interested.

42:28.146 --> 42:32.267
It's not the big time,
but you can get there from Darwin.

42:34.521 --> 42:37.225
I'm on my way to Darwin.

42:37.563 --> 42:39.375
Yeah?

42:40.417 --> 42:42.792
You going all the way?

42:43.313 --> 42:47.833
Alright, brother boy. That's a fair drive.

42:48.146 --> 42:50.683
All the way to Darwin.

42:52.021 --> 42:56.611
Oh, but, Rex,
you're gonna love Oodnadatta!

43:01.313 --> 43:03.521
Hey, you mob, look at this!

43:03.625 --> 43:07.236
Tilly caught a taxicab
all the way from Broken Hill!

43:07.917 --> 43:11.716
- Hey, Tilly! Hey, Tilly!
- Hey, get your own taxi!

43:18.083 --> 43:20.433
Tilly, where have you been?

43:24.229 --> 43:27.465
- Hey, Tilly.
- My man.

43:41.458 --> 43:43.430
Hey.

43:45.833 --> 43:49.578
- Hey, Brad.
- Hey, mate. How are you going?

43:50.167 --> 43:52.258
Come on, Rex.

43:53.604 --> 43:56.854
Peter. Move over before you fall over.

44:04.208 --> 44:06.758
- Beer?
- Yes, thanks, mate.

44:06.862 --> 44:09.313
- You got a room?
- It's not flash.

44:09.833 --> 44:12.303
Do I look flash?

44:13.854 --> 44:17.104
- 100 bucks.
- Says 50 on the sign outside.

44:17.938 --> 44:20.271
You get your $50 back
when I get my keys back.

44:20.375 --> 44:23.986
You don't give the keys back,
I get a new pair of shorts.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.083
No-Balls! Fuck off!

44:32.708 --> 44:35.095
Go on, get!

44:41.000 --> 44:45.229
- Why do you call him No-Balls?
- It's not a him.

44:45.958 --> 44:48.576
This is my boy Lionel.

44:48.680 --> 44:52.521
Gday, Lionel. How are you, mate? Hey?

44:52.625 --> 44:54.305
Hey, Tilly?

44:54.409 --> 44:57.604
- Tilly, you got a cigarette?
- Don't you want to know where I've been?

44:57.708 --> 45:00.521
No, I know where you've been.
On the grog with your useless cousin.

45:00.625 --> 45:02.979
Hey. I've been looking for work.

45:03.708 --> 45:06.472
Have you got a cigarette?

45:09.646 --> 45:11.847
Useless prick.

45:26.647 --> 45:30.156
Hey, mate. Give us a pack of smokes.

45:40.146 --> 45:44.229
- You bought them for me?
- No. I bought 'em for your woman.

45:44.542 --> 45:47.354
She not my woman. She my wife.

45:47.771 --> 45:50.430
She look like my woman?

45:54.667 --> 45:58.896
You've got a cigarette.
Well, I want a fuckin' cigarette, Tilly.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.917
I don't want a fur coat. Did I ask
for a fur coat? No. Or a holiday?

46:03.021 --> 46:05.667
No. I just want a cigarette.

46:05.771 --> 46:08.979
Well, you got one for yourself,
but did you get one for me? No!

46:09.500 --> 46:12.091
I mean, what is wrong with you, Tilly?

46:12.195 --> 46:15.059
What is wrong with you, fella?

46:22.646 --> 46:23.826
Nup.

46:26.625 --> 46:29.095
Thank you, my darling.

46:32.542 --> 46:34.979
You've got one hour.

46:35.083 --> 46:38.154
Then you're putting the kids
to bed, fat cat.

46:40.854 --> 46:43.869
Come on, Rex. I'll take you to your donga.

47:02.188 --> 47:03.792
Thanks, Tilly.

47:03.896 --> 47:07.695
No worries, baya.
I'll see you in the morning?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.167
Yeah, I thought there was.
You said there was more!

47:45.271 --> 47:48.625
Where the fuck is it? You little weasel!
Where the fuck is it?

47:48.729 --> 47:51.729
- I gave it to you!
- Where's the fuckin' money?

47:51.833 --> 47:53.188
Where's our fuckin' money?

47:53.292 --> 47:55.188
- You fuckin' hid it!
- Wait!

47:55.292 --> 47:57.479
- Give it here!
- I'm telling you!

47:57.583 --> 48:00.757
- Don't fuck with me, boy.
- Please!

48:02.354 --> 48:06.179
- We know you've got it.
- Shit.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.104
Listen! That's it! There's nothing else!

48:10.208 --> 48:12.653
Please, please, please!

48:34.500 --> 48:35.938
Tilly, get in!

48:36.250 --> 48:40.393
What the fuck are you doing,
Mr Cab Driver? He ain't got no money!

48:43.354 --> 48:47.375
For Chrissake, Tilly,
get in the fucking cab!

49:29.396 --> 49:31.981
How am I looking, Rex?

49:35.771 --> 49:40.271
Don't you fuckin' talk to me,
you nasty little prick.

49:40.375 --> 49:42.891
- You stole my wallet.
- I fixed your windscreen.

49:42.995 --> 49:45.425
I paid for it!

49:47.042 --> 49:50.828
Get out. You can walk back
to town from here.

49:51.979 --> 49:56.477
- Your wife will want to know where you are.
- No, she fuckin' won't.

49:57.333 --> 50:00.094
- Get out, Tilly!
- No!

50:01.479 --> 50:05.737
You want me out? You'll have
to shoot me and push me out.

50:11.396 --> 50:13.991
Probably do me a favour.

50:19.875 --> 50:22.336
Just drive, old man.

50:59.125 --> 51:02.180
Bitumen all the way from here, Pol.

51:46.500 --> 51:48.290
Prick.

51:50.708 --> 51:53.594
Oh, what the fuck do I do now?

51:56.083 --> 51:58.242
Hey, Rex.

51:59.438 --> 52:02.167
Never hide a roll of hundreds
up your arse.

52:03.104 --> 52:06.370
First place them fellas would look.

52:09.542 --> 52:12.393
Maybe I just come with you?

52:12.601 --> 52:14.984
Just to the Alice.

52:15.729 --> 52:18.475
Lay low for a little while.

52:22.500 --> 52:24.810
Don't worry, old man.

52:25.292 --> 52:27.602
I'll look after ya.

52:31.021 --> 52:32.451
Hey, Rex.

52:32.555 --> 52:36.141
- What are you going to Darwin for?
- None of your business.

52:38.479 --> 52:41.563
Hey, Rex, I'm feeling much better?

52:41.667 --> 52:44.157
Well, good for you.

52:45.625 --> 52:47.824
Hey, Rex.

52:50.854 --> 52:52.396
- Get in the front.
- What?

52:52.500 --> 52:53.518
Get in the front.

52:53.622 --> 52:56.500
I've never been driven round
by a whitefella before.

52:56.604 --> 52:58.979
Get in the front
or I'm turning the meter on.

52:59.083 --> 53:01.641
Unless it was a paddy wagon.

53:02.958 --> 53:05.313
Oh, come on, Rex!

53:05.417 --> 53:08.641
Let me dream!

53:32.792 --> 53:35.884
Alice Springs. Look at it, Rex.

53:35.989 --> 53:37.931
Glorious.

53:42.125 --> 53:46.664
They say if you see the Todd flow,
means you'll come back some day.

53:48.938 --> 53:51.454
I'm not coming back, Tilly.

53:52.375 --> 53:55.224
Whether it's flowing or not.

53:59.625 --> 54:01.313
So, just the one night, sir?

54:01.417 --> 54:03.688
That's right. Yeah, two rooms, one night.

54:03.792 --> 54:06.511
Great. Not a problem.

54:06.833 --> 54:10.104
And that'll be one room for you
and one for...

54:10.208 --> 54:12.132
Tilly?

54:12.667 --> 54:15.313
Okay. He's gonna need some photo ID.

54:15.417 --> 54:18.438
- For security purposes.
- I've got none of that.

54:18.542 --> 54:20.438
Then I'm afraid I can't help him.

54:20.542 --> 54:25.146
- Well, he can stay in my room, then.
- It's a single, sir. I'm sorry.

54:25.250 --> 54:29.352
But I don't have ID.
I don't even have a wallet!

54:29.688 --> 54:32.614
How's that for fuckin' photo ID?

54:48.958 --> 54:51.261
Got to go to the bank.

54:53.250 --> 54:55.344
You need some dough?

54:55.448 --> 54:57.669
To get home?

54:58.313 --> 55:00.935
Don't worry about me, Rex.

55:01.063 --> 55:04.563
That mob down the riverbed,
they'll look after me.

55:04.979 --> 55:07.476
I got family everywhere.

55:11.833 --> 55:14.347
You really gonna do this thing?

55:14.451 --> 55:15.533
Yeah.

55:20.396 --> 55:22.902
Maybe you'll come back as a ghost gum?

55:23.319 --> 55:25.771
Sit down by that riverbank all day long.

55:25.875 --> 55:29.317
I'd like that. Yeah.

55:34.604 --> 55:38.579
- Bye, Tilly.
- Good luck, old man.

55:50.250 --> 55:53.611
<i>Leave a message if you're good-looking.</i>

55:54.417 --> 55:57.724
<i>Hey, Pol. It's me, Rex.</i>

55:57.828 --> 56:01.354
<i>I'm in Alice Springs.
About halfway, I suppose.</i>

56:01.458 --> 56:04.000
<i>Been a hell of a ride so far, you know.</i>

56:04.104 --> 56:08.896
<i>I had this young blackfella, Tilly.
Fixed the windscreen in William Creek.</i>

56:09.000 --> 56:13.908
<i>So I gave him a lift, and then
he robbed me in Oodnadatta.</i>

56:14.221 --> 56:16.688
<i>But his wife reminded me
of... of you, you know.</i>

56:16.792 --> 56:19.604
<i>Anyhow, I'll call again.</i>

56:19.708 --> 56:21.271
You're precious, mate.

56:21.375 --> 56:22.667
- Fuckin' precious!
- <i>Pol...</i>

56:22.771 --> 56:25.938
Know what? You got rawhide knackers.
Triple stitching!

56:26.042 --> 56:28.354
Having problems with your Abo neighbours?

56:28.458 --> 56:29.854
- Just give 'em a house!
- <i>Pol...</i>

56:30.063 --> 56:33.292
<i>I don't want your house.
I don't want your dog.</i>

56:33.396 --> 56:37.532
You're a fool, Rex MacRae. A gutless fool!

56:37.979 --> 56:40.479
Call me and tell me about your adventures?

56:40.583 --> 56:45.266
Don't you dare call me again.
Don't you fucking dare!

57:13.125 --> 57:14.896
Sit down.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.096
Sit down!

57:51.417 --> 57:53.704
Big night?

58:00.708 --> 58:03.267
You still going to Darwin?

58:03.458 --> 58:04.893
Yep.

58:08.063 --> 58:10.638
Can I come with you?

58:48.063 --> 58:50.615
Sally's mob's from around here.

58:50.833 --> 58:53.200
Kaytetye mob.

58:55.021 --> 58:57.435
They didn't walk away.

58:58.208 --> 59:00.393
They fought.

59:01.417 --> 59:03.928
She's a tough one, that one.

59:06.167 --> 59:08.800
But she gotta be, you know?

59:10.708 --> 59:13.433
She's the only chance my kids have got.

59:18.104 --> 59:21.236
The reason I didn't go
play for Essendon...

59:22.396 --> 59:24.706
'cause I was scared.

59:26.500 --> 59:28.604
Sally...

59:28.708 --> 59:31.320
she begged me to go.

59:35.208 --> 59:37.768
I'm just full of bullshit.

59:44.979 --> 59:47.373
You got any kids?

01:00:05.729 --> 01:00:08.375
Hey, cuz. It's Polly.

01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:12.958
Hey, I was just thinking,
you know about the school holidays?

01:00:13.063 --> 01:00:16.896
Well, I got this spare house
across the road from me.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.854
True!

01:00:19.271 --> 01:00:21.646
Well, why don't youse come down?

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:26.613
Yeah. And the dogs! Yep.
The whole bloody mob!

01:00:51.271 --> 01:00:53.574
That your woman?

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:57.021
She's a blackfella.

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:59.135
She's my neighbour.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:03.138
She tell you you're a mad bastard
for doing this?

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:07.971
Tell you what, Tilly.

01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:10.684
I'll do you a deal.

01:01:12.042 --> 01:01:17.000
You don't tell me how to live my life
and I won't tell you how to live yours.

01:01:17.104 --> 01:01:18.993
Fair?

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:33.783
You want a beer?

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.852
Thirsty Thursday.

01:01:37.313 --> 01:01:39.425
Thirsty Thursday?

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.688
Cheque day. They don't serve
blackfellas on Thursday.

01:01:43.104 --> 01:01:45.554
Well, I can buy you one.

01:01:47.313 --> 01:01:49.679
Don't want one.

01:01:50.188 --> 01:01:52.786
I'm finished with it.

01:01:58.917 --> 01:02:01.458
Nic, the phones won't stop ringing.

01:02:01.563 --> 01:02:04.396
Everybody wants to know when this
bloody cab driver's gonna get here!

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.957
Me included. Just let me clear
the backlog, would you?

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:13.688
Well, that's all for now, Theresa.
Well done.

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:15.646
Bye.

01:02:25.146 --> 01:02:27.375
Feel the air, Rex.

01:02:27.479 --> 01:02:30.018
Put your window down.

01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:34.646
Feel that? Tropical.

01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:38.095
Fuckin' tropical, brother!

01:03:01.188 --> 01:03:03.770
Where we going, old man?

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:22.042
Gentlemen. What do you want?

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:26.433
Well, I want to play football
and he wants to kill himself.

01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:31.104
- Two beers, then.
- Nah, nah. Beer for him.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.801
Coke for me.

01:03:39.104 --> 01:03:41.050
Ta.

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:44.706
From the bottle?

01:03:52.042 --> 01:03:54.513
With ice and lemon.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.563
"Remember, the toes that you step on today

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:02.313
"may be attached to the arse
you'll have to kiss tomorrow."

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:05.677
That's good advice.

01:04:06.354 --> 01:04:08.594
For the swelling.

01:04:08.698 --> 01:04:12.236
Hold it up against your skin
for as long as you can stand it.

01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:17.104
I don't think you're from round here?

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:19.688
- London.
- London!

01:04:20.104 --> 01:04:22.334
What you doing here?

01:04:22.439 --> 01:04:24.354
Broadening my experience.

01:04:25.188 --> 01:04:27.388
Julie. Come on, sweetheart.
Glasses. Let's go.

01:04:27.492 --> 01:04:30.217
Alright. Keep your shirt on.

01:04:30.542 --> 01:04:32.146
Thanks.

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.350
I'm just going to go outside.
Play spot the blackfella.

01:04:36.183 --> 01:04:38.699
Shouldn't be too hard!

01:04:54.438 --> 01:04:56.991
Oh, I love that one.

01:04:57.095 --> 01:04:59.854
It's one of the oldest photos here.

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:04.758
Look at them.
No one deserves to be that happy.

01:05:07.063 --> 01:05:09.229
That's my mum and dad.

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:11.658
Fuck off!

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:23.479
- Bloody hell.
- Where was this airfield?

01:05:23.583 --> 01:05:28.784
Oh, it's still there. It's just behind
the pub. Even the hangar.

01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:38.717
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

01:05:40.292 --> 01:05:42.143
Thanks.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.646
Keep it.

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:49.098
- I won't tell no one.
- This is what I reckon about Australia.

01:05:49.202 --> 01:05:52.339
If you look around you, we've got people
living in Australia and coming here

01:05:52.443 --> 01:05:57.646
from all around the world and I look upon it
as one of those big old camp oven stews,

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:02.354
and in that big old stew, we've got peas,
corn, carrots and celery and a few beans,

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:06.513
and we've got a bit of rough old,
tough old Territory beef like me.

01:06:06.617 --> 01:06:09.375
And it's not gonna be a real
good feed tomorrow morning,

01:06:09.479 --> 01:06:11.583
but couple of hundred years
down the track.

01:06:11.688 --> 01:06:16.229
Let it brew, let it boil away, I'll tell
you now, it's gonna be real good tucker.

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:21.001
Hey! There's one local ingredient
you haven't thrown in yet!

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:24.757
A nice burnt pencil yam like me.

01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:27.063
You ever had pencil yam, Chilli?

01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:30.146
Bush carrot? Yeah, bush carrot.
I have, mate. They're bloody beautiful.

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.845
Well, you want to make that stew,
you better make sure you've got

01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:38.458
a few proper Australian ingredients in
there, or you're just wasting your time.

01:06:38.563 --> 01:06:42.563
Yeah, mate, no, hang on. He's absolutely
right. What's your name, young fella?

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:47.229
Tilly! Hey! Chilli and Tilly!
We can be a double act!

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:50.021
Oh, mate,
I'd love to be on your team, Tilly.

01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:53.271
Just standing there,
you look like you've got stories to tell.

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:57.771
- Have you got one for us tonight?
- Nup. But I'm a proper deadly dance man!

01:06:57.875 --> 01:07:00.521
Come on. Real Aussies can't dance.

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.875
- This one can.
- Oh, this one can.

01:07:02.979 --> 01:07:07.195
Hey, you mob out there tonight,
would you like to see Tilly dance?

01:07:09.083 --> 01:07:11.146
Come on up.
Put your hands together for Tilly.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:14.638
Let's have a look at this one.
Righto, Tilly.

01:07:14.742 --> 01:07:17.107
You're on the spot. Okay.
What have you got for us?

01:07:17.211 --> 01:07:20.548
Alright! Do you want to see a dance?

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:24.855
- I'll show you the butcher dance.
- The butcher dance?

01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:28.583
That's him. Proper special dance
from back my home way.

01:07:29.313 --> 01:07:31.063
I need clap stick. You got any clap stick?

01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:34.299
I've got clap sticks. No worries about
that at all. I'll do the clap sticks.

01:07:34.403 --> 01:07:37.563
Alright! Everyone watching.
I'll show you one time. That's it.

01:07:37.875 --> 01:07:40.063
- The butcher dance.
- The butcher dance. Okay.

01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:42.264
Let me hear that clap stick.

01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:47.208
<i>Ya butcha left foot in
Ya butcha left foot out</i>

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:51.407
<i>Ya butcha left foot in
And you shake it all about!</i>

01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:57.712
I can't top that one. Thanks, Tilly.
Put your hands together.

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:05.063
Oh, we love it. We love it.
You alright there, old fella?

01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:08.229
You're not gonna bust a popper valve, hey?

01:08:14.792 --> 01:08:17.251
Everybody, can you move, please?
He's not well. Come on.

01:08:17.354 --> 01:08:20.770
Alright, clear a space.
Clear a space, please.

01:08:21.812 --> 01:08:25.082
You're alright, darling.
You're alright. You're alright.

01:08:25.187 --> 01:08:28.457
- Julie, leave him be. Call an ambulance.
- That's two hours away. I'm a nurse.

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:31.010
Not while you're here, you're not.
You're a barmaid. Now go.

01:08:31.115 --> 01:08:34.354
I quit. You want to do something useful,
then find us a room I can take him to.

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:38.270
- We're full. Have a look around.
- He can have mine. Tilly, help me get him up.

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:40.957
- Come on, Rex.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:41.062 --> 01:08:43.559
Up you get. That's it.

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:48.435
You're alright, darling. Don't apologise.

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:54.229
What were you thinking drinking
beer in your condition?

01:08:54.332 --> 01:08:56.679
You served me.

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:05.895
Oh, my God!

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.389
This is you!

01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:10.917
You're all anyone's been
talking about round here.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.103
Grey nomads think you're a bloody hero.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:33.220
Now, lots of little sips.

01:09:34.562 --> 01:09:36.434
Rest!

01:09:40.312 --> 01:09:43.218
Since I don't work here anymore...

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.781
I'm gonna have a drink.

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:56.021
Thanks, Tilly.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.094
You know what you're doing, old man?

01:10:12.396 --> 01:10:14.167
Hello?

01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:16.161
<i>Polly?</i>

01:10:18.104 --> 01:10:19.802
It's really fucking early.

01:10:22.688 --> 01:10:28.205
Pol, about five years ago,
I was gonna ask you to marry me.

01:10:31.771 --> 01:10:34.117
I gotta go, Rex.

01:10:35.313 --> 01:10:38.000
<i>Pol, I'm sorry.</i>

01:10:38.104 --> 01:10:39.513
I gotta go.

01:11:09.854 --> 01:11:12.157
What's going on?

01:11:14.417 --> 01:11:17.481
Well, good morning to you too, Rex!

01:11:27.458 --> 01:11:29.755
What's going on, Rex?

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:34.415
Rex?

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.846
Get out.

01:11:38.688 --> 01:11:41.855
Get your gear and get out!

01:11:45.854 --> 01:11:48.316
Rex! What's up your arse?

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:52.146
- You should be in bed, old man.
- What's wrong?

01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:55.099
Rex!

01:11:55.203 --> 01:11:57.677
Rex, what the fuck are you doing?

01:11:58.563 --> 01:12:00.382
Rex!

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:04.073
Rex!

01:12:18.833 --> 01:12:20.763
Rex!

01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:25.886
Rex! Rex!

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.289
What the fuck is that?

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:40.179
It's a cane toad.

01:12:40.896 --> 01:12:43.704
Fat, ugly bastard.

01:12:49.688 --> 01:12:53.280
- It's hard.
- What is?

01:12:54.021 --> 01:12:56.414
To kill yourself.

01:12:58.688 --> 01:13:01.931
It's really fucking hard.

01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:12.661
Don't look at me like that, Rex.

01:13:13.688 --> 01:13:16.082
I like her.

01:13:16.479 --> 01:13:18.846
She likes me.

01:13:33.937 --> 01:13:36.625
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:13:36.729 --> 01:13:40.865
Can we pull over here?
Just for a second. Please?

01:13:46.302 --> 01:13:48.122
Thanks.

01:13:49.396 --> 01:13:53.455
Hey! Do you mind if I take a picture?

01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:57.986
Brilliant!

01:14:03.938 --> 01:14:07.907
Brilliant. Thanks.

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:22.875
The fascinating witches
Who put the scintillating stitches

01:14:22.979 --> 01:14:25.917
In the britches of the boys
Who put the powder on the noses

01:14:26.021 --> 01:14:30.104
Of the faces of the ladies of the harem
of the court of King Caractacus

01:14:30.208 --> 01:14:33.109
Were just passing by.

01:14:33.214 --> 01:14:36.000
How do you not know this song?
Isn't it an Aussie song?

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:38.542
Well, I never heard it.

01:14:38.646 --> 01:14:40.792
Do it on your own now.

01:14:40.896 --> 01:14:45.195
Well, the fascinating witches...

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.849
I can't do it!

01:14:53.042 --> 01:14:55.003
Rex!

01:14:55.313 --> 01:14:57.140
Rex!

01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:10.699
You gonna let me drive now?

01:15:15.917 --> 01:15:18.571
Then you need a break, my brother.

01:15:19.896 --> 01:15:21.805
Yep.

01:15:50.104 --> 01:15:53.702
It's beautiful. No doubt.

01:15:54.292 --> 01:15:57.896
Hey! You mob! Look at this.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.300
There's a crocodile down here
and he's wearing a T-shirt

01:16:01.404 --> 01:16:03.786
with my name on it.

01:16:05.688 --> 01:16:08.308
He is a lunatic, isn't he?

01:16:08.646 --> 01:16:10.618
Yeah.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.983
He's married too.

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:17.845
- Kids?
- Couple.

01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:07.354
Hey, brother boy. You made it.

01:17:07.458 --> 01:17:09.418
Not what I imagined.

01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:21.375
Doctor's not here.

01:17:21.479 --> 01:17:23.500
- Where is she?
- Got an appointment?

01:17:23.604 --> 01:17:26.708
- Well... no, but...
- Your name?

01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:29.158
Rex MacRae.

01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:32.415
I'm a cab driver.

01:17:33.208 --> 01:17:37.104
No one is allowed to legally kill anyone.

01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:39.835
You don't get it.

01:18:02.063 --> 01:18:05.279
Hello. I'm Dr Farmer.

01:18:09.865 --> 01:18:11.414
I'm Julie.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.332
I'm Tilly.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.258
Then you must be Rex.

01:18:19.813 --> 01:18:22.733
That the only colour it comes in?

01:18:24.406 --> 01:18:26.019
Yeah.

01:18:28.063 --> 01:18:31.758
Was it you that splashed
my face all over the papers?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.292
Why didn't you call me to tell me
where you were, how you were?

01:18:37.396 --> 01:18:41.167
I'm here! Like I said I would be.

01:18:41.271 --> 01:18:43.375
How's the pain?

01:18:43.479 --> 01:18:45.583
- Pretty constant.
- Okay.

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:49.583
Well, if you had called, I would've told you
that even though the bill is now law,

01:18:49.688 --> 01:18:53.333
there are still some hurdles to clear
before we can actually use it.

01:18:53.438 --> 01:18:58.271
There are three people we need
to convince before we can legally do this.

01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:01.854
A psychiatrist, to confirm
you're of sound mind.

01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:03.104
That might be tough.

01:19:03.208 --> 01:19:06.042
A specialist in your particular
form of cancer.

01:19:06.146 --> 01:19:07.584
To confirm I'm cactus.

01:19:07.689 --> 01:19:10.896
And both of those
have to come from the Territory.

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:14.479
You've got these people lined up, right?
You know who they are?

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.313
No. Not yet.

01:19:16.417 --> 01:19:20.812
But you made it sound like
it was a deadset fuckin' certainty.

01:19:20.917 --> 01:19:23.333
It's not easy, Rex.

01:19:23.438 --> 01:19:28.417
The Federal Government, the church,
the AMA. They don't want this.

01:19:28.521 --> 01:19:30.792
It takes power away from them

01:19:30.896 --> 01:19:34.783
and gives it to ordinary people
like you and me.

01:19:37.188 --> 01:19:39.813
They're gonna fight like hell.

01:19:39.917 --> 01:19:42.896
Why didn't you tell me
all this on the phone?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.017
I tried to, Rex.
But you wouldn't fucking listen.

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:52.718
You're gonna be a difficult patient.

01:19:53.187 --> 01:19:54.500
More than likely.

01:19:54.604 --> 01:19:58.346
You should try driving
2,000 K's with the bastard.

01:19:59.917 --> 01:20:02.479
So, I've got work to do.

01:20:02.583 --> 01:20:05.458
But first, you need proper care.

01:20:05.562 --> 01:20:09.365
Sonya, ring Karen at Darwin Hospital.

01:20:09.469 --> 01:20:12.396
- See if there's any beds in Palliative.
- No!

01:20:12.813 --> 01:20:16.201
No hospitals. That's why I'm here!

01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:19.928
There's a hospital in Broken Hill.
Just tell me the truth.

01:20:20.032 --> 01:20:23.813
Am I gonna get to use
that bloody thing or not?

01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:26.034
Well?

01:20:26.896 --> 01:20:29.021
Not yet.

01:20:29.445 --> 01:20:31.063
Then I'm driving home.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:35.683
- Hey, Rex, hold your horses.
- I'll do it. I'll care for him.

01:20:35.788 --> 01:20:39.934
But we'll need somewhere to stay.
Somewhere that's not a hospital.

01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:44.063
Four years' neonatal at Royal London.

01:20:44.167 --> 01:20:47.454
The past two years, I've been APRN
at West London Emergency.

01:20:55.521 --> 01:20:59.268
You can stay at my place until...

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:02.917
You can stay at my place.
It's small, but there's a spare room.

01:21:03.021 --> 01:21:07.333
I'll sleep here at the surgery.
I often do that anyway.

01:21:07.438 --> 01:21:10.218
Here's my address and phone.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.979
That's so I know where you are.

01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:24.646
My place is a bit of a mess.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:27.563
And I'll be a while.
I've still got patients to see.

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:30.333
That's alright, Doc.

01:21:30.438 --> 01:21:33.807
We've got a few things to do ourselves.

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:51.907
Let's go, guys!

01:21:58.917 --> 01:22:02.250
- Who are you?
- Tilly Johnson, sir.

01:22:02.354 --> 01:22:05.163
Tilly from Oodnadatta?

01:22:07.521 --> 01:22:09.854
You been training, Tilly?

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:12.542
Nah, but... I wanna.

01:22:12.646 --> 01:22:17.042
Sorry, it's too late.
Season starts in three weeks.

01:22:17.146 --> 01:22:21.981
I've got no time for bullshit. Come back
next year and do a pre-season with us.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:25.040
Hey!

01:22:25.667 --> 01:22:28.604
The kid was drafted by Essendon
a couple of years ago.

01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:31.021
He's the best full-forward
in the history of Oodnadatta!

01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:34.562
He's not coming back next year.
He's gonna play this year.

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:37.646
And if he's not gonna play for your mob,
he's gonna fuck off right now

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.812
and play for that mob over there!

01:22:39.917 --> 01:22:42.021
And after he kicks
a bag of 10 against you,

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:44.438
you can tell your supporters
how you could have had him

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:46.625
but you wouldn't give him a go

01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:50.310
'cause you don't have time for bullshit!

01:22:50.415 --> 01:22:51.979
So you vouch for him?

01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:54.618
Drove him all the way
from Oodnadatta, didn't I?

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:59.667
Alright, Tilly. Go and see the ladies
upstairs, grab some gear.

01:22:59.771 --> 01:23:03.583
You can have a run tonight
and you and I will talk after training.

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:05.742
Yes, sir.

01:23:08.094 --> 01:23:09.893
Go, boys!

01:23:15.396 --> 01:23:18.083
Is there a mob over there?

01:23:18.188 --> 01:23:20.458
Yeah. That's the Tigers.

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:23.198
These here are the Saints, brother.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.300
Thanks, Rex.

01:23:32.729 --> 01:23:36.458
- Meet me back here after?
- I can't, Tilly.

01:23:37.448 --> 01:23:39.585
Why not?

01:23:44.604 --> 01:23:46.208
You're his girlfriend now.

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:50.116
Well, he does have one quality
I look for in a man.

01:23:50.333 --> 01:23:52.529
He's not married with kids.

01:24:01.688 --> 01:24:05.333
Well, the fascinating witches
Who put the scintillating stitches

01:24:05.438 --> 01:24:07.854
On the britches of the boys
Who put the powder on the noses

01:24:07.958 --> 01:24:11.250
Of the faces of the ladies of the harem
of the court of King Caractacus

01:24:11.354 --> 01:24:14.299
Was just passing by.

01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:17.813
Right! Who's not here?

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:20.891
Who's already on their way home?

01:24:21.646 --> 01:24:23.456
Hello?

01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:28.021
Yeah, hold on. Dougie. It's for you.

01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:31.203
It's Rex, you stupid prick!

01:24:34.604 --> 01:24:38.917
Rex? How is ya, mate? Yeah?

01:24:39.021 --> 01:24:42.271
Good on ya. Yeah, you don't sound too bad.

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:46.083
Yeah, I'm alright, Rexie.
Yeah, the missus is alright.

01:24:46.188 --> 01:24:48.750
She wanted me to join
Alcoholics Anonymous, but...

01:24:48.854 --> 01:24:51.083
I said, "Alcoholics Anonymous?

01:24:51.188 --> 01:24:55.208
"How the fuck are you supposed
to stay anonymous in this town?"

01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.740
Dougie!

01:24:58.688 --> 01:25:02.938
What? Yeah. Yeah, I will.

01:25:03.042 --> 01:25:06.521
Alright, Rex.
Well, good talking to you, mate.

01:25:06.625 --> 01:25:08.727
See ya.

01:25:10.479 --> 01:25:13.979
Well? What did he say, you dopey prick?

01:25:14.604 --> 01:25:18.540
He made it.
The bastard's gonna fuckin' do it.

01:25:20.521 --> 01:25:23.107
Press the red button.

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:27.471
Yeah!

01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:44.763
Are you alright?

01:25:48.813 --> 01:25:51.829
I've never seen the sea before.

01:26:00.542 --> 01:26:04.457
- You can change your mind, you know.
- I know.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.118
There goes the sun.

01:26:18.833 --> 01:26:21.646
Dr Farmer. Dr Farmer. Dr Farmer.

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:24.292
The president of the AMA
has accused you of attention-seeking.

01:26:24.396 --> 01:26:29.417
And he's right. I'm seeking attention
for a patient's right to die with dignity.

01:26:29.521 --> 01:26:30.938
- What about Rex?
- Where is he?

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:32.458
Where is he now? Where is he?

01:26:32.563 --> 01:26:37.292
He's trying to stay alive long enough
to die. Make sense of that if you can.

01:26:37.396 --> 01:26:39.049
- Rex. Rex.
- ABC News, Rex.

01:26:39.153 --> 01:26:43.458
Alright, alright. One at a time.
One at a time! You.

01:26:43.562 --> 01:26:46.063
How are you feeling, Rex? Are you scared?

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:48.958
- What, about dying?
- Yes.

01:26:49.063 --> 01:26:50.917
Yeah, I suppose I am.

01:26:51.021 --> 01:26:53.583
I'm always scared of things
that I've never done before.

01:26:53.688 --> 01:26:56.938
Rex, how hard has it been
to convince your loved ones

01:26:57.042 --> 01:26:59.646
that the decision you're about
to make is the right one?

01:27:00.063 --> 01:27:02.438
There's no one else. It's just me.

01:27:02.542 --> 01:27:05.437
- No one at all?
- No.

01:27:05.542 --> 01:27:08.188
What do you do if Dr Farmer
doesn't get the signatures you need?

01:27:08.292 --> 01:27:11.792
I don't know. Go home, I suppose.

01:27:11.896 --> 01:27:14.417
- Alright. Alright.
- But if you go home...

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:17.833
That's it. That's it!
Thank you! Show's over!

01:27:17.937 --> 01:27:20.954
Show's over. Show's over...

01:27:24.979 --> 01:27:28.792
Julie, you're in the spare room
at the end of the hall.

01:27:28.896 --> 01:27:30.833
Mine's the one next door.

01:27:30.938 --> 01:27:35.042
And you, Rex, will be centrestage
on the sofa bed.

01:27:35.146 --> 01:27:37.575
It'll be cosy.

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:41.750
A bit early with the flowers,
aren't you, Doc?

01:27:41.854 --> 01:27:44.167
Call me Nic.

01:27:44.479 --> 01:27:48.496
I think I might stick with Doc,
if you don't mind.

01:27:49.354 --> 01:27:53.229
Alright. Let's deal
with your pain management.

01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:57.656
Start with 10ml. See how we go.

01:27:59.604 --> 01:28:04.244
Doc, you said before that we needed
to convince three people.

01:28:05.396 --> 01:28:08.354
Well, you've told me two of them...

01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:10.979
but who's the third?

01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:12.992
You?

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:16.179
You.

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:32.438
I want to help you, Rex.

01:28:32.542 --> 01:28:37.289
But I want to be able to help
a lot more people after you.

01:28:38.083 --> 01:28:41.785
That machine... is not a gimmick.

01:28:42.771 --> 01:28:48.536
You and I have to be 100% sure
that this is what you want.

01:28:52.125 --> 01:28:56.000
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

01:28:56.729 --> 01:28:58.623
Good.

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:02.695
Then I've got a lot of phone calls
to make on your behalf.

01:29:11.563 --> 01:29:13.272
- Really?
- No.

01:29:26.146 --> 01:29:28.700
I don't want to be the first.

01:29:34.292 --> 01:29:37.126
- This one is chocolate.
- Thanks.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:03.641
I designed it myself.
There's a three-part questionnaire...

01:30:19.187 --> 01:30:21.495
Do you have any pets?

01:30:21.599 --> 01:30:24.729
- Got a dog.
- What's its name?

01:30:25.104 --> 01:30:28.716
- Dog.
- Just "Dog"?

01:30:29.417 --> 01:30:31.849
'Rex' was taken.

01:30:40.917 --> 01:30:43.382
Do you miss your mates?

01:30:44.042 --> 01:30:47.845
I thought I would, but... nah.

01:30:48.271 --> 01:30:51.653
How many times can you hear
the same bloody stories?

01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:58.104
What do you miss?

01:30:58.208 --> 01:31:01.875
Me? Nothing.

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.500
What is there to miss about 12-hour shifts

01:31:05.604 --> 01:31:09.958
and shit and vomit and arrogant doctors
and ungrateful patients?

01:31:10.063 --> 01:31:12.393
There must be something.

01:31:13.177 --> 01:31:15.726
You're getting all that right here.

01:31:17.917 --> 01:31:19.625
I know!

01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:22.708
I just came out here to get some sun.

01:31:23.021 --> 01:31:24.915
I just...

01:31:26.458 --> 01:31:29.039
wanted to see the sun.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:41.442
Polly.

01:31:49.583 --> 01:31:51.889
Caitlin, have you got my hair dryer?

01:31:51.993 --> 01:31:56.220
Oh, get out of there, you noisy
little buggers! You should've been in bed!

01:31:56.324 --> 01:32:00.146
- Noel, tell your kids!
- <i>Leave a message if you're good-looking!</i>

01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:01.948
<i>Pol?</i>

01:32:03.292 --> 01:32:05.458
<i>Pol, I'm... I'm in Darwin.</i>

01:32:05.563 --> 01:32:08.705
<i>This thing I'm doing, it's...</i>

01:32:09.438 --> 01:32:12.530
<i>it's taking a bit longer than I thought.</i>

01:32:13.583 --> 01:32:18.000
<i>Pol, I... just wanted to say...</i>

01:32:19.345 --> 01:32:22.833
<i>sorry. I won't call again.</i>

01:32:22.938 --> 01:32:25.958
Aunty Polly? Evelyn took your hair dryer.

01:32:26.063 --> 01:32:28.438
No, I didn't!

01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:44.604
He's asleep. I just dosed him up.

01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:47.042
The pain's...

01:32:47.146 --> 01:32:49.479
The psychiatrist said yes!

01:32:49.583 --> 01:32:54.229
- Oh, well done!
- Now all we need is a specialist.

01:32:54.438 --> 01:32:59.262
I went to university with him,
so... bubbles tonight!

01:32:59.813 --> 01:33:03.971
None for me... please. Thank you.

01:33:14.563 --> 01:33:17.665
I'm sorry. It's just...

01:33:19.813 --> 01:33:22.614
I'm not sure he's ready.

01:33:23.854 --> 01:33:26.608
He'll never be readier.

01:33:26.713 --> 01:33:30.729
- Julie...
- What are you two whispering about?

01:33:30.833 --> 01:33:36.810
Congratulations, Rex.
Apparently you are of sound mind.

01:33:39.896 --> 01:33:44.257
Why do I get the feeling
that woman wants me dead?

01:33:45.521 --> 01:33:47.041
Hey.

01:33:48.146 --> 01:33:51.266
It's Tilly's first game this weekend.

01:33:51.771 --> 01:33:53.813
There's something I want to do.

01:33:53.917 --> 01:33:56.583
Came to training the first three weeks.

01:33:56.688 --> 01:33:59.729
Did everything right. I mean, you saw him.

01:34:00.667 --> 01:34:03.438
Picked him at full-forward
to play this Saturday.

01:34:03.542 --> 01:34:07.051
- I haven't seen him since.
- Do you know where he is?

01:34:09.271 --> 01:34:14.102
Try looking in the long grass.
They sometimes end up there.

01:34:14.417 --> 01:34:16.637
It does happen.

01:34:22.479 --> 01:34:24.389
Hey.

01:34:24.854 --> 01:34:27.083
Is he any good?

01:34:27.568 --> 01:34:30.196
He's an absolute star.

01:34:34.708 --> 01:34:36.688
Yeah. Sense of play, that's right.

01:34:36.792 --> 01:34:40.417
Two for the pissheads,
one for the man of God.

01:34:40.521 --> 01:34:42.864
Gday, gorgeous.

01:34:45.729 --> 01:34:47.601
Oi.

01:34:48.313 --> 01:34:50.367
Pol!

01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:19.507
Stop. That's him.

01:35:31.979 --> 01:35:35.563
Hey, Rexie!

01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:38.995
- You want a drink?
- No, mate.

01:35:45.688 --> 01:35:49.000
- What happened, mate?
- What happened?

01:35:49.417 --> 01:35:51.699
Nothing happened.

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:55.296
I'm good, Rex! Yeah.

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.875
Nice out here in the long grass.
It's deadly, brother!

01:35:59.979 --> 01:36:04.210
They all countrymen here. Arnhem Land.

01:36:05.104 --> 01:36:07.146
Tiwi mob.

01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:11.360
I'm Arabana from Oodnadatta!

01:36:13.104 --> 01:36:16.114
Well, the fascinating britches

01:36:16.218 --> 01:36:18.354
On the stitches...

01:36:18.458 --> 01:36:22.083
- Can't get it.
- First game this weekend, isn't it?

01:36:22.188 --> 01:36:24.204
You playing?

01:36:25.917 --> 01:36:28.448
I don't think so!

01:36:30.146 --> 01:36:33.069
Then you should go home to your family.

01:36:35.563 --> 01:36:37.648
Then you should fuck off.

01:36:38.854 --> 01:36:41.490
Don't tell me what to do!

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:44.768
We had a deal, remember?

01:36:45.563 --> 01:36:48.917
- You're the one that wanted it.
- I was wrong.

01:36:49.438 --> 01:36:52.896
- Call your family.
- You call your family!

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.479
- I haven't got any.
- Oh, bullshit!

01:36:56.583 --> 01:36:58.688
Everyone got someone.

01:36:58.792 --> 01:37:01.750
You don't just crawl in the ground
like a fuckin' worm.

01:37:01.854 --> 01:37:05.521
You've gotta have someone
to cover the dirt back over again.

01:37:05.625 --> 01:37:09.484
- I won't fight with you.
- Why don't you just die, then?

01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:13.042
Hey, Rex?

01:37:13.458 --> 01:37:16.639
When are you just gonna fuckin' die?

01:37:17.667 --> 01:37:21.625
You're the most gutless person I ever met.

01:37:21.729 --> 01:37:25.979
Drive all the way to Darwin
so someone else can do the dying for ya.

01:37:26.083 --> 01:37:28.548
What the fuck is that?

01:37:28.958 --> 01:37:32.104
Telling me what to do. Fuck me!
I'm here with my people!

01:37:32.208 --> 01:37:35.623
Where are you, Rex?
Where the fuck are you?

01:37:39.313 --> 01:37:41.979
Look what you've done,
you stupid old prick!

01:37:43.229 --> 01:37:45.101
Tilly!

01:37:46.354 --> 01:37:49.165
- Tilly... Tilly, leave him!
- You alright?

01:37:49.269 --> 01:37:51.382
Leave him.

01:38:35.167 --> 01:38:37.167
You kids, stop that!

01:38:37.271 --> 01:38:41.049
Get out of here! This isn't your joint!
This is somebody else's house! Get!

01:38:41.153 --> 01:38:43.254
Get out!

01:38:44.854 --> 01:38:49.167
Chrissakes, Noel! You need to teach
those kids some respect!

01:38:49.271 --> 01:38:53.396
They're just muckin' around, Pol.
It's Friday night. Family night.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.813
These are Rex's records!

01:38:55.917 --> 01:38:58.573
Rex is family!

01:39:20.979 --> 01:39:24.190
But you said you would two weeks ago.

01:39:24.979 --> 01:39:28.167
No, Bob, no. Unacceptable.

01:39:28.271 --> 01:39:31.174
He's dying right now.

01:39:32.438 --> 01:39:35.167
Please, Bob. Don't do this.

01:39:35.271 --> 01:39:37.408
Please.

01:39:44.521 --> 01:39:46.705
How is he?

01:39:47.208 --> 01:39:50.363
Alive. Just.

01:39:53.771 --> 01:39:56.674
The specialist just reneged.

01:39:57.583 --> 01:40:01.306
They're saying if we go ahead and do it
before the law is repealed,

01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:06.245
then we could be charged
with murder retrospectively.

01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:09.340
Grey areas.

01:40:09.444 --> 01:40:13.552
Specialists are scared shitless of them.
They want everything black and white.

01:40:13.656 --> 01:40:16.375
He doesn't want to be here.

01:40:16.479 --> 01:40:21.725
I know that, Julie! Jesus Christ!
You think I don't know that?

01:40:24.333 --> 01:40:27.875
- What do you know about Polly?
- Who?

01:40:27.979 --> 01:40:33.093
His neighbour. He keeps a picture
of her under the visor in his cab!

01:40:35.375 --> 01:40:38.642
- No. He said there was...
- How would you?

01:40:38.746 --> 01:40:41.604
You couldn't.
Too busy to spend any time with him.

01:40:41.708 --> 01:40:45.521
I do, because I'm the one changing his sheets
and wiping his arse and talking to him.

01:40:45.625 --> 01:40:50.583
This is what he wants.
He wouldn't be here if he didn't.

01:40:50.688 --> 01:40:54.792
- This is his choice.
- What if he was wrong?

01:40:54.896 --> 01:40:58.354
What if he was lying to you? To himself?

01:40:58.458 --> 01:41:03.083
You needed him to be the perfect
patient, so he was for you!

01:41:03.188 --> 01:41:08.750
You're just the same as them. You want
everything to be black and white, but it's not.

01:41:08.854 --> 01:41:10.974
It's grey.

01:41:16.896 --> 01:41:19.455
Anyway, it's too late now.

01:41:31.604 --> 01:41:34.216
Did you put Polly there?

01:41:39.396 --> 01:41:41.911
Tell me about her.

01:41:42.271 --> 01:41:44.429
Unhook me.

01:41:44.938 --> 01:41:47.357
Get me out of here.

01:41:52.438 --> 01:41:55.667
- I can't.
- You can.

01:41:55.771 --> 01:41:59.317
You're a nurse, aren't you?
Of course you bloody can.

01:41:59.729 --> 01:42:02.060
Unhook me.

01:42:05.938 --> 01:42:08.500
It took my old man five years

01:42:08.604 --> 01:42:12.375
to drown to death with miner's lung.

01:42:12.479 --> 01:42:16.063
Mum never said a kind word
to him through the whole thing.

01:42:16.167 --> 01:42:18.768
Not that I can remember.

01:42:20.479 --> 01:42:22.892
She dragged me in to see him

01:42:23.412 --> 01:42:25.521
in a room just like this.

01:42:25.625 --> 01:42:29.746
Picked me up and pushed me against him.

01:42:34.979 --> 01:42:37.456
"Give your father a kiss."

01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:42.580
"Give your father a kiss."

01:42:46.708 --> 01:42:49.501
Come on. Let's get you out of here.

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:21.572
Alright. Your turn.

01:43:22.646 --> 01:43:24.971
Tell me about her.

01:43:27.313 --> 01:43:30.063
She has a nice smile.

01:43:30.167 --> 01:43:33.496
I wouldn't say that to her face.

01:43:35.479 --> 01:43:37.513
But yeah.

01:43:38.688 --> 01:43:42.373
It's like the sun coming up
when she flashes it.

01:43:46.458 --> 01:43:48.592
Call her!

01:44:03.688 --> 01:44:08.274
Have you any idea
how much trouble you've caused?

01:44:08.729 --> 01:44:11.635
I am his doctor, Julie.

01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.042
Administration's gone ballistic.
Journalists.

01:44:14.146 --> 01:44:16.438
What the fuck did you think
you were doing?

01:44:16.542 --> 01:44:19.386
He didn't want to be there.

01:44:19.938 --> 01:44:22.476
We had a deal, Doc.

01:44:25.292 --> 01:44:27.875
I should never have agreed to this.

01:44:27.979 --> 01:44:30.648
And I never should have helped you.

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.985
Rex would be back
in Broken Hill right now.

01:44:42.063 --> 01:44:44.674
Just do it, Doc.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.676
Please.

01:44:49.365 --> 01:44:52.832
Just hook me up to that machine and do it.

01:45:00.979 --> 01:45:03.300
I can't, Rex.

01:45:03.771 --> 01:45:05.678
I won't.

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:08.858
Not until it's legal.

01:45:10.896 --> 01:45:12.968
Driving up here to die

01:45:13.072 --> 01:45:15.465
was the first thing I ever believed in.

01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:19.694
Ever in my life.

01:45:21.917 --> 01:45:24.278
Was I wrong?

01:46:00.979 --> 01:46:04.303
<i>Leave a message if you're good-looking!</i>

01:46:04.854 --> 01:46:06.282
<i>Pol?</i>

01:46:06.417 --> 01:46:09.949
Nah, Noel here. Polly's cousin.
She's moved in across the road.

01:46:10.292 --> 01:46:14.619
- <i>You got the number?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah, mate.

01:46:19.458 --> 01:46:21.265
Hello.

01:46:21.369 --> 01:46:23.322
<i>Pol.</i>

01:46:23.646 --> 01:46:25.718
<i>It's me.</i>

01:46:26.458 --> 01:46:28.592
<i>I'm still here.</i>

01:46:31.271 --> 01:46:33.691
You sound...

01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:37.883
far away.

01:46:39.021 --> 01:46:41.195
Darwin.

01:46:42.292 --> 01:46:44.595
It's far enough.

01:46:45.146 --> 01:46:46.773
<i>You've moved into the house?</i>

01:46:46.877 --> 01:46:50.322
Yeah. It's quieter here.

01:46:54.813 --> 01:46:56.782
I miss you, Rex.

01:46:57.021 --> 01:47:00.104
<i>Not much of me left to miss.</i>

01:47:01.833 --> 01:47:05.176
- Yes.
- <i>What?</i>

01:47:05.417 --> 01:47:07.417
Yes.

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:11.075
That's what I would've said
if you'd asked me to marry you.

01:47:13.813 --> 01:47:16.313
<i>I love you, Rex.</i>

01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:19.292
It sounds weird to say it now.

01:47:19.396 --> 01:47:22.795
All the shit we've talked,
all the shit we haven't.

01:47:23.438 --> 01:47:26.879
I love you. Always have.

01:47:29.438 --> 01:47:31.883
<i>There it is.</i>

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.917
There it is.

01:47:35.021 --> 01:47:38.750
And if you were here right now
holding my hand,

01:47:38.854 --> 01:47:42.863
I'd never let go, Rexie. Never, ever.

01:47:44.729 --> 01:47:47.195
I love you too, Pol.

01:48:40.563 --> 01:48:42.586
Alright.

01:48:44.063 --> 01:48:46.570
Just press the space bar.

01:49:29.125 --> 01:49:31.003
No!

01:49:45.729 --> 01:49:48.756
- Done?
- Done.

01:49:51.146 --> 01:49:52.979
Now...

01:49:53.083 --> 01:49:56.215
Now, if you use this, you can't drive.

01:49:57.250 --> 01:50:00.854
If you don't use any,
there's no way you'll be able to sleep.

01:50:00.958 --> 01:50:04.167
The pain'll get you home,
but after that...

01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:06.113
Yeah.

01:50:07.333 --> 01:50:09.565
What are you gonna do?

01:50:10.125 --> 01:50:12.249
Haberdashery.

01:50:13.938 --> 01:50:16.074
I'm a nurse.

01:50:16.469 --> 01:50:18.886
It's all I'm good at.

01:50:20.052 --> 01:50:22.394
Thanks, love.

01:50:23.438 --> 01:50:25.614
For everything.

01:50:36.208 --> 01:50:38.032
Pain?

01:50:38.375 --> 01:50:40.667
Kicking in now.

01:50:40.771 --> 01:50:44.168
Then go. Goodbye, Rex.

01:50:46.938 --> 01:50:48.874
Good luck.

01:51:08.958 --> 01:51:13.895
He said yes! He just called
and told me he'd do it!

01:51:19.833 --> 01:51:22.004
What happened?

01:51:22.479 --> 01:51:24.838
He's gone.

01:51:25.729 --> 01:51:28.608
Oh, God, no!

01:51:30.896 --> 01:51:32.367
You didn't...?

01:51:32.471 --> 01:51:36.242
He's not dead. He's gone.

01:51:36.958 --> 01:51:39.523
I left him at East Point.

01:51:48.354 --> 01:51:51.292
Gday, Pol. Heard you moved in.

01:51:51.396 --> 01:51:52.948
The house is a disgrace.

01:51:53.052 --> 01:51:55.438
Gutters haven't been cleaned
since the '70s.

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:57.794
What do you reckon? You mind, Polly?

01:52:01.125 --> 01:52:03.571
Bloody top day, Pol.

01:52:12.083 --> 01:52:14.333
- Yep?
- <i>Hello, Rex?</i>

01:52:14.438 --> 01:52:18.915
- Nah, I'm not Rex. This is Tilly.
- Where is he, Tilly? Where's Rex?

01:52:19.019 --> 01:52:23.260
Oh, I remember that fella.
He could be anywhere?

01:52:23.365 --> 01:52:26.229
He could be floating like
a crocodile in Berry Springs.

01:52:26.333 --> 01:52:30.458
He could be a ghost gum sitting
on that riverbank there in Alice.

01:52:30.563 --> 01:52:35.813
Fuck me, he might even be in Oodnadatta!
That fella, he's gone.

01:52:35.917 --> 01:52:37.946
Can't help you, I'm afraid.

01:52:59.771 --> 01:53:01.167
- Smoke?
- Smoko.

01:53:01.271 --> 01:53:04.583
Hey, hey, hey! You finish that first.

01:53:07.333 --> 01:53:09.226
Thanks, Pol.

01:53:37.125 --> 01:53:39.699
Yeah. I'll be back next week.

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:43.965
Kakadu first, then I'll be on the plane.

01:55:55.938 --> 01:55:58.315
You got a beer?

01:56:04.583 --> 01:56:06.960
Hey, Dog.

01:56:08.646 --> 01:56:11.236
How are you, mate?

01:56:18.292 --> 01:56:21.911
- Can you drink this?
- Nah.

01:56:22.854 --> 01:56:25.300
Just want to hold it.

01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:39.639
How are you doing?

01:56:40.313 --> 01:56:42.818
I'm better now.

01:56:43.146 --> 01:56:46.042
Yeah. That's good.

01:56:46.146 --> 01:56:48.083
That's good.

01:56:48.188 --> 01:56:51.291
You've been on one hell of a journey.

01:56:51.646 --> 01:56:54.000
I missed you.

01:56:54.104 --> 01:56:56.560
Why wouldn't you?

01:57:04.354 --> 01:57:06.563
Oh, the place is...

01:57:06.667 --> 01:57:09.029
looking nice.

01:57:10.063 --> 01:57:14.314
- Did Noel do it?
- Noel? Nah!

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.396
The boys come round and give us a hand.
Fixed it up in an afternoon.

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.970
Pretty handy blokes.

01:57:23.208 --> 01:57:27.526
- Yes, they are.
- Simmo's a bossy prick, but...

01:57:37.313 --> 01:57:42.386
- How's the family?
- Oh, bloody mad. Chaos.

01:57:42.521 --> 01:57:44.813
Noel's alright, though.

01:57:44.917 --> 01:57:47.625
Them girls need an aunty.

01:57:47.729 --> 01:57:50.467
I like having 'em across the road.

01:57:52.271 --> 01:57:54.958
I'm glad you moved in.

01:57:55.063 --> 01:57:57.357
Felt good.

01:58:01.708 --> 01:58:04.273
It's your house now.

01:58:05.625 --> 01:58:08.021
You and Dog's.

01:58:08.125 --> 01:58:10.585
You're here, aren't you?

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:15.221
It's ours. It's our house, Rex.

01:58:26.458 --> 01:58:29.084
Oh, you smell good.

01:58:33.813 --> 01:58:36.354
No pain anymore.

01:58:41.792 --> 01:58:43.899
No pain.

01:58:56.250 --> 01:58:58.761
There goes the sun.

01:59:37.542 --> 01:59:41.052
<i>You go through life and sometimes find</i>

01:59:41.156 --> 01:59:44.490
<i>You never really paid life mind</i>

01:59:44.594 --> 01:59:47.979
<i>You didn't want to cross the line</i>

01:59:48.083 --> 01:59:51.633
<i>To see if someone cared</i>

01:59:53.208 --> 01:59:56.594
<i>Your life is like a ragged tent</i>

01:59:56.698 --> 02:00:00.115
<i>You never gave, you always lent</i>

02:00:00.219 --> 02:00:03.729
<i>Afraid that you'd lose everything</i>

02:00:03.833 --> 02:00:07.181
<i>Everything you had</i>

02:00:08.563 --> 02:00:11.896
<i>But it's never too late to come back home</i>

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.542
<i>Like a carnival that tumbles by</i>

02:00:15.646 --> 02:00:20.967
<i>It's said you've got to give love
to be loved</i>

02:00:57.063 --> 02:01:00.458
<i>Beside it now but motionless</i>

02:01:00.563 --> 02:01:03.990
<i>Your perfect vision might impress</i>

02:01:04.094 --> 02:01:07.281
<i>A blind man who has never seen</i>

02:01:07.385 --> 02:01:11.526
<i>A sunset or a dawn</i>

02:01:12.083 --> 02:01:15.542
<i>You've seen the light
You've seen the burning flame</i>

02:01:15.646 --> 02:01:19.458
<i>You've got your hands
back on the wheel again</i>

02:01:19.563 --> 02:01:23.146
<i>Inhaling desert Cinders</i>

02:01:23.250 --> 02:01:26.188
<i>In the air you breathe</i>

02:01:26.292 --> 02:01:29.583
<i>And it's never too late to come back home</i>

02:01:29.688 --> 02:01:33.417
<i>Like a carnival that tumbles by</i>

02:01:33.521 --> 02:01:38.843
<i>It's said you've got to give love
to be loved</i>
