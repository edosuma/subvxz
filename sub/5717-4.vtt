WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:05.104
Order, please! Order!

00:05.105 --> 00:08.865
This year's ball is in aid
of Mr Goddard's soup kitchen.

00:08.985 --> 00:12.905
Returned Soldiers' Refuge. Well,
why don't you come and have a look?

00:14.144 --> 00:17.864
Does he want something else?
Did you want something else?

00:19.545 --> 00:20.985
Shall I put you on the roster?

00:21.105 --> 00:24.385
I don't think so, Mr Goddard.
I'm not sure I'm of use.

00:24.464 --> 00:25.904
Are you expecting, love?

00:26.024 --> 00:28.064
Is that it?
I can't have this baby, Peg.

00:28.184 --> 00:32.024
You are carrying a child!
Aunt Peg, please! No.

00:32.144 --> 00:35.544
So I've decided to run for
pre-selection as a candidate

00:35.624 --> 00:37.144
for the Country Party.

00:37.224 --> 00:39.304
Is Jack Anna's natural father?

00:39.384 --> 00:41.254
Yes.

00:41.262 --> 00:43.024
They can all keep a
secret, that's for sure.

00:43.104 --> 00:45.984
The most important thing, I think,

00:46.104 --> 00:49.504
is that your parents loved Anna
as if she were their own.

00:50.944 --> 00:53.744
And who were you being?
I sent the soil from the west hill

00:53.864 --> 00:57.564
to be analysed. Very good soil
for planting quality grapes.

00:57.645 --> 01:00.358
Rightio, chaps, problem solved.
Where am I?

01:00.358 --> 01:02.924
Resident card shark Miss Bligh's
offered to make up a table.

01:03.045 --> 01:05.125
Watch out for my sister,
she's lethal.

01:09.559 --> 01:11.999
So, it's Olivia you'll be painting,
Lloyd.

01:12.079 --> 01:13.799
And my son and husband.

01:13.879 --> 01:15.559
Lucky me.

01:15.639 --> 01:17.719
Cigarette?

01:17.799 --> 01:18.799
No, thank you.

01:21.679 --> 01:26.119
I don't want to just be pretending.

01:27.519 --> 01:33.199
I wanted to thank you for today,
but I am a happily married woman.

01:40.959 --> 01:47.879
The church teaches us that
a child is a gift, a gift from God.

01:48.090 --> 01:50.050
However, I've never been in
your position.

02:13.090 --> 02:14.250
Duck bill ready?

02:15.690 --> 02:18.450
How far along is she?
11, 12 weeks, she says.

02:23.258 --> 02:25.698
I love you.
I always will.

02:28.794 --> 02:30.954
You are carrying a child!

02:31.074 --> 02:34.634
It's so sad for George that
your marriage didn't proceed.

02:37.314 --> 02:40.514
Stop. Stop!
Lie down!

02:40.594 --> 02:42.234
I've changed my mind!

02:42.314 --> 02:45.714
It's way too late in the piece to change
your mind! If you leave now, you won't

02:45.834 --> 02:47.714
get your money back.
Get her out of here.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.674
I said get her out of here!
No!

02:50.634 --> 02:52.074
No, not that door!

02:56.394 --> 02:58.018
You should have told me
you were a nurse.

03:05.377 --> 03:07.497
Excuse me, Missus, you dropped...

03:07.617 --> 03:13.217
Get back in here! Now sit down
and I'll be with you in a moment.

03:18.777 --> 03:20.377
I couldn't do it, Aunt Peg.

03:20.897 --> 03:25.057
God was watching down, my love.
He was.

03:27.737 --> 03:30.857
A baby.

03:30.937 --> 03:33.857
Babies only need love, darling.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.217
You'll work it out.

03:48.017 --> 03:50.537
Ah, excellent evening, thank you.

03:50.657 --> 03:53.817
James, I've just been telling
Sir Richard about your plans.

03:53.937 --> 03:56.737
Excellent, James.
Open the door and let the future in.

03:56.817 --> 03:58.817
Graham Greene. To paraphrase.

03:58.897 --> 04:01.977
I'm not a total philistine.

04:02.057 --> 04:05.017
What a relief, Sir Richard.

04:05.097 --> 04:07.337
Let the future in.

04:07.457 --> 04:10.537
Men from the boys. It's excellent.
Thank you, Sir Richard.

04:13.617 --> 04:16.257
I wouldn't mind trading
Macquarie Street for Inverness.

04:16.337 --> 04:18.377
Oh, I could live on the land.

04:18.497 --> 04:22.777
Or off the land. On and off.
Well, it's hard work.

04:22.897 --> 04:24.417
It's all card games
and morning tea.

04:24.537 --> 04:27.657
A ride out on the horse from time
to time to check on the sheep.

04:27.777 --> 04:30.697
You medicos, all sailing
around on your yachts on

04:30.777 --> 04:33.457
whatever afternoon it is.

04:33.537 --> 04:35.417
Yes, don't fall ill on a Wednesday.

04:35.537 --> 04:38.137
Doctor has the tiller in the one
hand and a lager in the other.

05:08.697 --> 05:11.217
So, what sort of portrait's this
Ellis-Parker going to do?

05:11.297 --> 05:15.577
All your abstract swirly bulldust my child
can do better than that sort of thing?

05:15.657 --> 05:18.097
Another Archibald scandal?

05:18.217 --> 05:20.737
Good abstract
painters, take Picasso...

05:20.857 --> 05:25.017
Someone has to, I s'pose.
...began his painting career with

05:25.097 --> 05:27.017
portraits. Modelling Velasquez.

05:27.137 --> 05:28.977
The question for
our modern times...

05:29.097 --> 05:31.057
Oh, don't tell me
Lloyd wants 'em nude.

05:31.177 --> 05:34.057
...is why anyone
would want a portrait.

05:34.177 --> 05:36.777
They are simply a substitute
photograph. One wants

05:36.897 --> 05:40.657
an expression of the subject
and that is what Lloyd will do.

05:40.737 --> 05:42.577
It's not a real job, is it?

05:42.657 --> 05:44.777
It's not something a real man does.

05:44.897 --> 05:47.977
Did you know that he was
an official war painter

05:48.057 --> 05:49.537
on the front line of France?

05:49.657 --> 05:52.537
Since his return, every
exhibition he's had has sold out.

05:52.617 --> 05:54.737
Oh, an investment tip, Sir Richard.

05:54.817 --> 05:56.337
You go to all of those, do you?

05:56.417 --> 05:58.457
Exhibitions? Opening nights?

05:58.577 --> 06:01.657
Red dots.
I do when I'm in town.

06:01.777 --> 06:04.972
Can you write? Why don't you show
me what you can do? Write me...

06:04.973 --> 06:06.657
What do you call it?
Critique, a review.

06:06.777 --> 06:10.537
Let Sydneysiders know what
they should like about art.

06:10.617 --> 06:12.457
That's not the role of a critic.

06:12.577 --> 06:17.097
Of course it's bloody not. I know
that. I'm trying you out for a job.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.977
A word, George.

06:27.857 --> 06:29.537
What's he talking about?

06:31.137 --> 06:33.417
Art reporter. Moi.

06:36.337 --> 06:39.057
So, this is it?

06:39.137 --> 06:41.457
You'll head back to the city?

06:41.577 --> 06:43.617
The art scene is
hardly a fulltime job.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.337
You'll get seduced by
the bright lights.

06:47.457 --> 06:50.097
First part of that
sentence, I quite like.

06:56.337 --> 07:00.017
You're back to health. You're ready.

07:00.137 --> 07:04.937
All my regional editors are on
board, very keen to see you run.

07:05.057 --> 07:07.857
Pre-selection committee knows which
way to jump and all you have to do

07:07.937 --> 07:09.937
is pull your finger out.

07:10.057 --> 07:13.137
Brace yourself, George.
I back winners.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.537
Do you come down to Sydney
very often?

07:22.617 --> 07:25.177
Yes, sometimes.

07:28.097 --> 07:30.937
You'll dine with me next time,
I hope.

07:32.857 --> 07:36.017
Monday to Friday,
my body is a temple.

07:37.617 --> 07:40.177
Saturday to Sunday, a ruin.

07:43.457 --> 07:45.977
Goodnight, Mr Fox.

07:46.097 --> 07:48.221
Thank you for everything you've
done for my father.

08:33.857 --> 08:35.697
How's my beautiful boy?

08:43.136 --> 08:44.297
Georgie?

08:45.497 --> 08:50.577
Georgie? James, it's Georgie.

08:50.737 --> 08:52.537
The baby's not there.

08:55.897 --> 08:57.176
I can't find him.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.937
Georgie, where are you?

09:00.497 --> 09:04.217
Oh, dear God, where is he?

09:04.297 --> 09:06.137
James, I can't find him.

09:06.217 --> 09:08.617
I can't find him!

09:08.697 --> 09:10.337
Livvy, just calm down.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.937
I need to know where he is!

09:12.017 --> 09:13.777
I need you to find him.

09:13.857 --> 09:14.896
Just find him!

09:14.897 --> 09:16.577
I will. We will. Just calm down!

09:16.697 --> 09:22.057
Alright! Alright. George,
we need to notify the police.

09:22.177 --> 09:24.097
Not until we've finished
searching the house.

09:24.177 --> 09:26.017
Please, we are wasting time.

09:26.137 --> 09:28.977
Ah, nothing, sir.
I checked all the bedrooms.

09:29.057 --> 09:32.697
Someone has taken him.

09:32.817 --> 09:36.297
They must have, because...
because where else could he be?

09:36.417 --> 09:39.017
I've found him.
Thank God.

09:39.097 --> 09:41.177
Now we can all go to bed.

09:41.657 --> 09:42.937
There you are, darling.

09:43.937 --> 09:48.817
Georgie. Oh, shh.
Quite a relief.

09:51.177 --> 09:55.177
Make yourself decent.
Where was he?

09:55.497 --> 09:58.617
He was in Rose's room.
He was in bed with her.

09:58.737 --> 10:01.257
I didn't mean to worry you.
Of course you didn't.

10:01.337 --> 10:03.417
In bed with her?

10:03.537 --> 10:06.977
He wasn't settling. The poor wean's
gums were sore. He's teething.

10:07.057 --> 10:09.457
Everyone was busy. You wasn't here.

10:09.577 --> 10:11.657
Of course I was here,
you stupid girl.

10:11.777 --> 10:16.497
Giving us all a fright like that.
He's perfectly fine, Olivia.

10:16.577 --> 10:18.017
Thank you, Reggie.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.297
Livvy.

11:18.657 --> 11:25.137
Olivia. It's alright. It's alright.

11:26.177 --> 11:32.577
The baby's right here. He's sound
asleep. You go back to sleep now.

12:02.577 --> 12:03.637
Hello!

12:04.177 --> 12:06.777
Oh! Gino!

12:08.097 --> 12:09.577
I thought you said
they were vines.

12:09.657 --> 12:10.680
They are.

12:10.737 --> 12:12.377
It's all rootstock.
They're like weensy,

12:12.497 --> 12:15.017
little baby vines.
It's a twig, darling.

12:15.097 --> 12:17.217
It's sangiovese rootstock.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.457
It'll grow into a beautiful vine
that will produce grapes that will

12:20.577 --> 12:25.257
make a beautiful bottle of chianti.
It's Hans Christian Anderson.

12:25.337 --> 12:26.897
It's the Ugly Duckling.

12:26.977 --> 12:30.017
You are such a romantic and you

12:30.137 --> 12:33.657
are a much more attractive
vine than I thought you were.

12:33.777 --> 12:35.977
So, how much is all
this going to cost?

12:36.057 --> 12:37.817
Caro.

12:37.897 --> 12:39.377
It's an investment.

12:39.497 --> 12:42.337
But you would ask if you needed
any help, wouldn't you, Gino?

12:42.417 --> 12:44.697
If you needed money, or anything?

12:44.777 --> 12:46.817
I got the money.

12:46.897 --> 12:48.657
How long till they start producing?

12:48.777 --> 12:52.257
Oh, five years.
Maybe 10.

12:54.137 --> 12:56.017
Well, ah, I need

12:56.137 --> 13:00.217
to get your mother back to Ash Park
before her reputation's in tatters.

13:00.297 --> 13:02.297
Bye, Mama.

13:02.377 --> 13:07.697
Bye, Jack. Bye, Papa.

13:11.617 --> 13:12.768
Papa.

13:13.657 --> 13:16.857
Papa.

13:21.377 --> 13:24.377
Dear Prudence, do forgive me.

13:26.017 --> 13:28.177
Poor Norman was forced
to remind me of the time.

13:28.297 --> 13:31.737
I was thoroughly absorbed
by the Women's Weekly.

13:31.857 --> 13:35.737
Did you know they are planning to
enter an all-women team in the Redex

13:35.817 --> 13:37.697
Car Trials? It's quite remarkable.

13:37.777 --> 13:39.337
Good on them. I can't think of

13:39.457 --> 13:41.817
anything worse. The lack of
facilities. Can you imagine?

13:41.937 --> 13:44.097
They breed them
differently these days.

13:44.217 --> 13:47.377
Clearly with scant regard
for personal hygiene.

13:47.457 --> 13:49.337
Now, the fundraiser.

13:49.457 --> 13:52.857
The rest of the committee
have seen fit to ignore your...

13:52.937 --> 13:54.417
How shall I put it?

13:54.537 --> 13:57.537
Unconventional critique
of the proposed event.

13:57.657 --> 14:00.257
If you're referring to my
observation that the primary purpose

14:00.377 --> 14:04.737
of a fundraiser is to raise funds,
I hardly regard that as a critique.

14:04.857 --> 14:07.337
Critique or not, it put
a few noses out of joint.

14:12.497 --> 14:14.337
Douglas Goddard telephoned.

14:16.457 --> 14:18.097
Seems he's trying to chase you down.

14:18.217 --> 14:20.897
Thought you might
still be staying here.

14:20.977 --> 14:24.577
Oh, probably wanting a donation.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.617
Sarah, she is coming?

14:36.217 --> 14:38.857
She's in Sydney, remember?

14:38.977 --> 14:41.337
Her Aunt wasn't well.
Peg?

14:41.417 --> 14:42.977
Mm.

14:43.097 --> 14:45.977
She did not tell
me she was leaving.

14:46.057 --> 14:47.577
Bloody women, eh?

14:47.977 --> 14:49.813
They're an independent
lot these days, Rene.

14:52.537 --> 14:53.777
Bloody women.

15:01.057 --> 15:04.097
The rubbish that some of these so-called
critics write about modern art.

15:04.217 --> 15:07.137
They probably think
Monet is avant-garde.

15:07.217 --> 15:08.897
My wife just bought a Monet.

15:09.017 --> 15:11.817
Oh, I imagine it went
with the wallpaper.

15:11.897 --> 15:13.697
Doesn't Jack serve breakfast?

15:13.777 --> 15:16.137
In more ways than one.

15:16.257 --> 15:19.097
Your sister thinks I'm an ignoramus.
Don't take it personally.

15:19.217 --> 15:22.337
When I mentioned I liked Stubbs,
she almost wept.

15:22.457 --> 15:24.537
I'd rather ride a horse
than see it on a wall.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.277
Thankfully, George's
political views are

15:26.297 --> 15:28.737
slightly more progressive.
Well, not too progressive, I hope.

15:28.857 --> 15:30.377
We don't want to
frighten the horses.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.417
Oh, if I don't get moving soon,

15:33.537 --> 15:35.457
my secretary's going to
bring out the old whip,

15:35.577 --> 15:38.937
which might not be an altogether
unpleasant experience. Ladies.

15:39.057 --> 15:41.417
I'll see you out.
Tell me when they've confirmed

15:41.537 --> 15:43.417
pre-selection
and I'll get things rolling.

15:43.497 --> 15:45.617
As I said, George, I back winners.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.257
Well, we've had too many politicians around
here who make promises they never keep.

15:49.337 --> 15:51.137
I do intend to get things done.

15:51.257 --> 15:53.097
That's what we want to
hear on the hustings.

15:53.217 --> 15:58.497
You're a shoe-in, George, but you do
need a wife. I'll see you in Sydney.

16:06.297 --> 16:08.897
I didn't mean to scare you,
Miss Olivia, I truly didn't.

16:09.017 --> 16:10.617
I love little Georgie.
I know you do.

16:10.697 --> 16:12.657
I know.

16:12.737 --> 16:14.337
Let's just...

16:14.417 --> 16:17.337
We'll leave it at that, shall we?

16:17.417 --> 16:19.577
Thank you, Miss Olivia.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.257
Darling.

16:30.257 --> 16:35.377
I feel so silly,
making all that fuss last night.

16:35.497 --> 16:39.817
But you don't think it a bit much
she had our son in bed with her?

16:39.937 --> 16:42.897
Darling Livvy,
you're like a tiger with her cub.

16:42.977 --> 16:45.257
You're right.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.817
Come here.

16:52.417 --> 16:53.977
Livvy.

16:54.057 --> 16:55.817
Not in front of the baby.

16:55.897 --> 16:57.537
It's not right.

16:59.137 --> 17:01.937
No. Of course not.

17:17.257 --> 17:19.137
Thank you, sir. I do
appreciate your time.

17:20.696 --> 17:22.176
Hooroo, Ted. We'll see ya.

17:22.257 --> 17:23.577
See ya, Roy.

17:23.737 --> 17:25.217
He's a good bloke, Ted.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.217
Yeah.
Where's that bloody dog gone?

17:28.297 --> 17:30.017
Thank you for this, Roy.

17:30.097 --> 17:31.577
Given the circumstances, I didn't

17:31.697 --> 17:34.417
think it appropriate to call
on the farmers in my vehicle.

17:34.537 --> 17:38.377
Mr Bligh, your vehicle would have
bust her hump up that first hill.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.297
Here!

17:40.417 --> 17:42.777
Pretty serious about
this politics lark, eh?

17:42.857 --> 17:44.737
Yes, I am. I want to drag

17:44.857 --> 17:49.217
Inverness into the 20th century,
kicking and screaming if need be.

17:49.337 --> 17:52.377
You heard Ted. Two days of rain
and this road's impassable. How's a

17:52.497 --> 17:56.457
man supposed to make a living if he
can't even get his stock to market?

17:56.577 --> 17:58.777
Some people don't take
too kindly to change.

18:00.377 --> 18:02.297
Which is why I may need your help.

18:02.417 --> 18:04.417
Well, I'll be glad
to talk to 'em for ya.

18:04.537 --> 18:06.617
Whether or not they'll
listen, that's another thing.

18:06.697 --> 18:08.137
Thank you, Roy.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.137
I'll drop you on
the way to the hospital.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.977
Something I want to do for Missy.

18:17.817 --> 18:20.177
Here! Get in the back!

18:22.777 --> 18:25.577
I thought I'd get you out and about,
doing a bit of hard yakka.

18:25.697 --> 18:29.777
Ah, there's to be no hard
yakka, just gentle physical work.

18:29.857 --> 18:31.377
Gentle.

18:31.457 --> 18:33.577
You understand?

18:33.697 --> 18:36.097
Roy wants you to
move back in with him.

18:36.217 --> 18:38.417
And he's right.
Fresh air and exercise will do you

18:38.537 --> 18:40.937
more good than lying about here.
I leave the hospital?

18:41.057 --> 18:43.177
Too right.
Today, if you like?

18:43.297 --> 18:47.617
I think the nurses will like
not to have the scary man.

18:47.737 --> 18:50.017
Yeah.
I'll get it!

18:50.377 --> 18:51.577
I'll get it!

18:51.697 --> 18:54.497
I'm looking for Miss P Malone.
Yes.

18:54.857 --> 18:58.137
No. I'm sorry.
She was a young girl. Blonde.

18:58.617 --> 19:00.417
You must mean my niece, Sarah.

19:00.537 --> 19:02.937
I'll just get her.
Hang on a minute.

19:03.857 --> 19:05.497
Sarah!

19:08.177 --> 19:09.937
I telephoned the doctor.
I told him Linda was

19:10.057 --> 19:12.577
unwell but he didn't listen.
I overheard you were a nurse.

19:12.697 --> 19:16.497
Yes. Yes, come in.
She needs to lie down.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.057
I'm so sorry.

19:23.777 --> 19:26.337
Can I talk to you for a moment?

19:33.257 --> 19:35.977
Linda's very sick, Nancy.
She needs to go to the hospital.

19:36.097 --> 19:39.257
No. If I take her to
the hospital, they will report her.

19:39.377 --> 19:41.817
She needs to see a doctor.
Can't you fix her?

19:41.897 --> 19:44.177
No. Only a doctor can help her now.

19:44.297 --> 19:48.091
They will report her to the police.
It would kill her father.

19:48.092 --> 19:50.177
Right now, the only thing we
need to be concerned about is

19:50.257 --> 19:52.337
saving your daughter's life.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.737
You think Linda could die?

19:56.337 --> 19:57.397
Yes.

20:06.281 --> 20:07.881
Call for you, Doctor Duncan.

20:07.928 --> 20:09.488
Ah, I'll take it in my office.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.880
Jack Duncan.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.400
Are you alright?

20:25.399 --> 20:26.839
Yes.

20:29.599 --> 20:32.599
Yes. Ah,
get her here as soon as possible.

20:34.354 --> 20:35.874
Has the mother got a car?

20:37.793 --> 20:40.353
I'll organise transport.

20:40.434 --> 20:41.874
I'll think of something.

20:47.994 --> 20:50.194
Elizabeth.
Jack telephoned me.

20:50.228 --> 20:52.428
He said you had urgent
need of Norman's services.

20:52.548 --> 20:55.708
Sarah,
I'm fully apprised of the situation.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.228
Come in.

21:04.268 --> 21:05.948
It was an incomplete procedure.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.628
Let's get you to the hospital.

21:12.668 --> 21:13.788
Nice and easy.

21:13.908 --> 21:15.108
Here's your case, dear.

21:15.908 --> 21:16.988
Thanks, Peg.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.788
Darling, I love you.

21:52.268 --> 21:56.748
Sarah! Where is Sarah!

21:58.228 --> 22:01.988
Now, calm down, dear old mate.
She'll be home directly.

22:02.108 --> 22:04.508
Where do you want this?
How about right there?

22:04.588 --> 22:06.868
I'll get a bit of grub on.

22:06.988 --> 22:09.528
Got a couple of lamb chops with
your name written all over 'em.

22:33.068 --> 22:34.468
That's better, eh?

22:47.348 --> 22:49.308
How often do they have
to be watered?

22:50.468 --> 22:53.588
Every day for the first month.
By hand?

22:54.028 --> 22:56.468
After that, once a week.

22:56.588 --> 23:00.548
So we cart the water over
here and then we water each

23:00.668 --> 23:02.908
one of them by hand, every day?

23:03.028 --> 23:04.668
One day, we'll get irrigation.

23:05.068 --> 23:07.788
What about everything else, Gino?

23:07.868 --> 23:09.308
When do we find time to do all

23:09.428 --> 23:12.108
the rest of the work?
Hey.

23:12.188 --> 23:14.948
Everything will be good.

23:15.068 --> 23:20.388
Yeah? It'll all work out. Come on,
just one more row and we're done.

23:20.408 --> 23:21.971
But I haven't ridden
Stardust in days.

23:22.028 --> 23:23.199
You can ride him tomorrow.

23:24.068 --> 23:25.588
I promise.

23:42.068 --> 23:43.708
Please, just wait here.

23:43.788 --> 23:45.948
I'll be back in a moment.

23:46.068 --> 23:47.668
You up to assisting?
Of course.

23:47.748 --> 23:49.748
It'll just be the two of us.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.148
What's happening?

23:52.228 --> 23:54.148
Why aren't they saying anything?

23:54.268 --> 23:57.268
Your daughter is in
the best of hands now.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.188
Linda is all I've got.

23:59.308 --> 24:01.764
You know you're going to have
to be very strong. Come along.

24:01.765 --> 24:03.988
I'll wait with you.

24:05.468 --> 24:07.628
She's still bleeding.

24:07.708 --> 24:10.868
Blood pressure fluctuating.

24:10.948 --> 24:12.508
Thank you, Marjorie.

24:16.988 --> 24:18.668
She'll be alright, won't she?

24:18.748 --> 24:20.508
We'll do our best.

24:20.628 --> 24:24.018
Linda, my name is Jack Duncan.
I'm a doctor here at Inverness.

24:24.018 --> 24:25.455
I'm going to be looking after you.

24:33.788 --> 24:35.748
Hysterectomy at 15.

24:40.988 --> 24:43.428
There's a lot of blood here.

24:43.508 --> 24:45.788
Thank you. And a bowl?

24:48.388 --> 24:50.748
Take a closer look
at that, will you?

24:50.828 --> 24:53.708
Can't see for the blood.

24:53.788 --> 24:55.788
The uterine wall's perforated.

25:00.988 --> 25:03.468
Come on, Linda, stay with us.

25:06.148 --> 25:07.268
Why is it taking so long?

25:07.388 --> 25:08.668
They've been in there for hours.

25:15.988 --> 25:18.028
Inverness Hospital?

25:18.148 --> 25:21.788
Is that you, Mrs Collins?
Yes?

25:21.908 --> 25:26.988
Um, there was a young girl
brought in earlier.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.068
Oh, yes.

25:32.588 --> 25:36.628
As a matter of
fact, I'm very worried, Mrs Bligh.

25:36.748 --> 25:40.668
They are still in surgery
and it has been quite some time.

25:46.268 --> 25:48.348
These will go nicely
in the dining room.

25:48.428 --> 25:52.068
And perhaps some white ones as well?

25:52.148 --> 25:54.268
Great Maiden's Blush.

25:56.508 --> 25:57.988
What did you say?

25:58.068 --> 25:59.708
Oh, it's the name of the rose.

25:59.828 --> 26:03.548
Father gave it to my mother on
their first wedding anniversary.

26:03.628 --> 26:06.868
He always was a romantic.

26:06.948 --> 26:11.548
So, is this the young prince?

26:11.668 --> 26:16.588
Yes.
Does he have a name?

26:16.668 --> 26:18.668
George.

26:18.748 --> 26:20.388
After his grandfather.

26:20.508 --> 26:23.108
Well, a fine, solid young fellow
you are.

26:23.228 --> 26:27.348
I will try to do justice
to you, young George.

26:27.428 --> 26:29.388
And particular justice to you.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.948
You look a little flushed, Olivia.

27:10.428 --> 27:12.628
I'm sorry.

27:12.708 --> 27:15.228
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

27:15.348 --> 27:18.108
I tried.
There was nothing I could do.

27:18.188 --> 27:21.348
But you said... You said...

27:21.428 --> 27:23.228
I'm so sorry.

27:46.028 --> 27:47.228
Oh, Jack.

28:11.388 --> 28:17.628
Barukh attah Adonai eloheinu
Melekh ha'olam, dayan ha-emet.

28:22.865 --> 28:24.385
Ruptured appendix.

28:24.472 --> 28:27.552
I thought 'miscarriage' was the usual
euphemism on the death certificate.

28:29.677 --> 28:31.477
The man was a butcher.

28:31.497 --> 28:33.797
I had to remove the uterus
and I still couldn't save her.

28:33.875 --> 28:35.675
Elizabeth doesn't need
to know the details.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.595
He should be struck off.

28:38.675 --> 28:43.995
He probably is struck off. Christ.

28:45.635 --> 28:48.835
She was 15. She was only a child.
Maybe we shouldn't have brought her

28:48.915 --> 28:51.715
here. All that way.

28:51.735 --> 28:53.615
If she'd gone to a Sydney
hospital, she still might be alive.

28:53.635 --> 28:57.395
Now, Jack, enough.
You did the best you could.

28:57.515 --> 29:00.195
You really shouldn't
be here, Elizabeth.

29:00.275 --> 29:02.395
You're too involved as it is.

29:02.515 --> 29:03.995
Sarah's right.
Thank you both for your

29:04.115 --> 29:06.515
consideration, but it's
quite unnecessary.

29:11.229 --> 29:15.989
You're buggered.
Come on, I'll run you home.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.869
That could have been me.

29:35.069 --> 29:36.909
I almost went through with it.

29:38.229 --> 29:39.629
But you didn't.

29:45.829 --> 29:48.469
I don't know how I'm going to
tell Rene about the baby.

29:52.589 --> 29:55.149
We often spoke of having children.

29:56.949 --> 29:59.509
And then the war came.

30:01.549 --> 30:03.829
I know it's going to
break his heart.

30:07.282 --> 30:09.282
Hey, he may surprise you.

30:41.601 --> 30:42.857
Sarah.

31:10.642 --> 31:12.802
..he didn't report it.

31:12.922 --> 31:14.862
Evening, Doctor Duncan.
I thought you'd left.

31:14.937 --> 31:16.457
I have paperwork to finish.

31:16.537 --> 31:17.537
Sergeant Franklin?

31:17.657 --> 31:19.817
Got a bloke in lock up
I want you to see.

31:20.217 --> 31:22.257
Got a nasty gash on his leg.

31:22.617 --> 31:24.257
And how'd he come by that?

31:24.497 --> 31:28.977
Came in with it. I hear you've
had a busy night yourself.

31:31.497 --> 31:34.937
Yes.
Mrs Bligh.

31:35.497 --> 31:37.057
I was going to leave you a message.

31:37.297 --> 31:39.817
I believe it was your car
that brought the girl in here.

31:40.707 --> 31:41.747
Yes, it was.

31:42.427 --> 31:45.667
I might need you to make a statement
to that effect in the near future.

31:46.387 --> 31:49.467
Might you?
Right then.

31:51.067 --> 31:52.297
Sergeant.

31:53.467 --> 31:56.467
Remind me, the reason you didn't
join up?

32:00.067 --> 32:01.267
Well, I couldn't.

32:02.227 --> 32:04.307
And I had to look after my mother.

32:04.867 --> 32:08.387
Mm, I miss your mother.

32:09.347 --> 32:10.347
I knew her well.

32:10.467 --> 32:13.227
As you know, we served on the War
Memorial Committee together.

32:13.427 --> 32:15.227
Very competent woman.

32:15.347 --> 32:16.947
More than capable
of running the farm

32:17.027 --> 32:18.547
single-handedly, I'd have thought.

32:22.067 --> 32:23.667
Mrs Bligh.

32:29.987 --> 32:33.467
I promised your mother I
would look after you

32:33.547 --> 32:35.787
and I intend to keep that promise.

32:35.907 --> 32:38.467
You have more than acquitted
that promise, we both know that.

32:38.547 --> 32:42.067
You're wrong, Jack. You went to war.

32:42.187 --> 32:45.987
You fought and suffered
for this country.

32:46.107 --> 32:49.547
It's I who shall be
forever in your debt.

32:52.587 --> 32:57.027
No, no, no, no, no. That needs to be
in the middle of the room.

32:57.147 --> 32:59.227
Somewhere the men
can gather around it.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.747
That's it. Very good.

33:09.787 --> 33:12.267
Now, the feet are secure?

33:12.347 --> 33:14.027
Yes, thank you, Rodney.

33:15.923 --> 33:16.983
Thank you.

33:57.964 --> 34:04.564
# When I grow too old to dream

34:04.644 --> 34:10.804
# I'll have you to remember

35:11.204 --> 35:16.164
♪ I'll have you to remember ♪

36:02.924 --> 36:07.044
All this coming and going must put
quite a strain on a relationship.

36:07.124 --> 36:09.577
Sydney's such a wild, old place.

36:09.577 --> 36:11.004
Don't waste your breath, Regina.

36:11.359 --> 36:13.439
I've had better men than you try to
rattle my cage.

36:14.045 --> 36:16.045
Carolyn had quite the reputation
at one time.

36:17.045 --> 36:19.285
Are you sure you're alright?

36:19.302 --> 36:20.742
I'm very happy to stay.

36:20.902 --> 36:23.002
I'm fine, honestly.

36:23.049 --> 36:26.129
Regina has everything in hand.

36:26.249 --> 36:30.729
You promised you'd go with Olivia with
Georgie to the hospital, remember?

36:33.209 --> 36:35.529
Regina isn't Elaine, George.

36:35.649 --> 36:37.849
They may look alike,
but that's as far as it goes.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.229
It wasn't just Regina.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.509
It was mother too, remember?

36:40.529 --> 36:43.449
She is worming her way into this place
far too much and I don't trust her.

36:43.529 --> 36:47.289
Carolyn, you worry too much.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.689
Miss Art Reporter.

36:59.449 --> 37:01.089
I can do this, Jack.

37:01.169 --> 37:02.229
I know I can.

37:18.489 --> 37:19.729
There you are...

37:19.849 --> 37:22.369
Edward.
...Edward.

37:22.449 --> 37:25.089
What a brave little boy. A bit of

37:25.209 --> 37:28.129
redness and swelling is normal.
He may get a slight temperature.

37:28.249 --> 37:31.449
Telephone
or just contact us if you're at

37:31.569 --> 37:35.049
all worried.
It's alright.

37:36.809 --> 37:40.329
All done?
He hasn't had the injection yet.

37:40.489 --> 37:42.769
Can I help?

37:42.849 --> 37:44.329
Oh, would you?

37:44.449 --> 37:46.569
He always settles
with his grandfather.

37:46.689 --> 37:50.089
Of course he does.
It's alright.

37:50.169 --> 37:51.889
I need to freshen up.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.729
I'll just be a moment.

38:07.169 --> 38:09.249
I believe it's baby George's turn.

38:12.169 --> 38:14.089
I hope Rene's enjoying the Satie.

38:15.049 --> 38:17.929
We seem to share similar tastes
in music.

38:18.569 --> 38:20.169
Yes, he loves...

38:21.849 --> 38:23.329
George.

38:27.249 --> 38:30.089
These gifts. This kindness.

38:30.169 --> 38:32.249
It has to stop.

38:32.329 --> 38:34.329
I think it's best you stay away.

38:34.449 --> 38:37.969
Sarah!
Ah, Olivia. Come on in.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.689
I am so glad it's you.

38:39.769 --> 38:41.569
Yes, well, the waiting's the worst.

38:56.906 --> 38:57.906
Oh, thank you.

38:58.075 --> 38:59.995
I've never seen the men so happy.

39:00.876 --> 39:02.916
So engaged.

39:03.555 --> 39:05.275
I talk to them, of course.

39:05.395 --> 39:09.755
I make sure they're fed, but this
was living. They were alive.

39:09.875 --> 39:12.835
I must be going.
May I leave this here?

39:12.955 --> 39:15.395
Yes. Yes, of course.
My coat?

39:15.515 --> 39:17.715
Ah, I hung it up.
I'll get it for you.

39:24.395 --> 39:26.875
I have so many
ideas for this place.

39:26.955 --> 39:28.595
Things we could do with the men.

39:28.675 --> 39:30.155
If it's not too much of an

39:30.275 --> 39:32.675
imposition, I'd really like
to talk to you about them.

39:32.795 --> 39:34.995
Oh, certainly, Mr Goddard.
I'd be most interested.

39:35.115 --> 39:38.555
Well, if you're not doing anything this
evening, perhaps we might have dinner.

39:41.075 --> 39:42.795
I don't think so.

39:42.875 --> 39:45.955
But thank you for the invitation.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.075
If Prudence Swanson could have seen
you with those men...

40:02.395 --> 40:05.555
A toast to The Chronicle's newest
art critic!

40:05.675 --> 40:09.595
Well, I'm not going to drink to
something that may never happen.

40:09.715 --> 40:12.555
You haven't even written anything
yet and has it occurred to you Sir

40:12.675 --> 40:15.595
Richard may not like what you write?
Don't be so Presbyterian, mother.

40:15.715 --> 40:17.955
I don't expect him
to like what I write.

40:18.075 --> 40:19.515
I expect him to
publish what I write.

40:19.595 --> 40:22.355
Vanity, thy name is woman.

40:22.435 --> 40:24.555
Oh, alright.

40:26.195 --> 40:28.835
Thank you.
There are two openings next

40:28.915 --> 40:30.555
Wednesday. I plan to go to both.

40:30.675 --> 40:34.755
One of the artists is
very avant-garde.

40:34.875 --> 40:38.875
You have a good brain, Carolyn.
It's about time it was used.

40:41.915 --> 40:43.755
Oh, good heavens.

40:43.875 --> 40:48.875
Oh, is that a flea? Where on
earth have you been, Mother?

40:48.995 --> 40:51.835
Playing piano at a returned
servicemen's refuge all day,

40:51.915 --> 40:54.275
since you ask.

40:54.355 --> 40:56.595
Suddenly at a loss for words?

40:56.715 --> 40:59.995
Not a very good omen for your future
career, I wouldn't have thought.

41:10.115 --> 41:14.475
Why were you working at Carlo's?
I was helping a friend.

41:16.275 --> 41:18.835
You've got to learn
to say, no, Gino.

41:18.955 --> 41:22.835
I'm not saying it's not
good to help friends, it is.

41:22.955 --> 41:25.555
But we don't have the time
to do our own work, let alone

41:25.635 --> 41:27.315
anyone else's. Gino!

41:27.395 --> 41:30.275
Maybe he will help us one day.

41:31.795 --> 41:36.115
The men were initially a little
reticent, but we persisted.

41:36.235 --> 41:39.075
I have completely exhausted
my wartime repertoire.

41:39.155 --> 41:40.635
I never knew you had one.

41:42.955 --> 41:46.395
No, I found the whole experience
profoundly moving.

41:46.515 --> 41:50.715
Mr Goddard said he'd never
seen the men look so alive.

41:50.795 --> 41:52.515
No, what was the word he used?

41:52.595 --> 41:54.395
'Engaged'. That was it.

41:54.475 --> 41:56.395
He said the men were engaged.

41:56.515 --> 42:01.635
These men,
they're all war veterans?

42:01.755 --> 42:04.755
Yeah,
damaged beyond repair, some of them.

42:06.395 --> 42:08.435
Jack was lucky to have you.

42:10.395 --> 42:15.715
So, tell me, who is this Mr
Goddard you keep talking about?

42:15.795 --> 42:17.715
Douglas Goddard.

42:17.835 --> 42:20.915
I've mentioned his
name precisely twice.

42:21.035 --> 42:22.995
Goddard's Menswear?
Mm.

42:23.075 --> 42:25.515
Widower, about your age?

42:25.595 --> 42:27.955
I am interested in the welfare of

42:28.075 --> 42:30.995
our returned servicemen
and so is Mr Goddard.

42:31.075 --> 42:35.315
How's Regina been behaving herself?

42:35.395 --> 42:37.235
That woman has an uncanny knack

42:37.355 --> 42:39.355
for making herself
invaluable to George.

42:39.475 --> 42:42.035
You know, I cannot credit your
brother's apparent inability to

42:42.115 --> 42:43.795
see through her wiles.

42:43.915 --> 42:45.615
This is George we're
talking about, Mother.

42:45.635 --> 42:47.315
Mm.
Sweet, kind George.
