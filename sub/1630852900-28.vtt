WEBVTT

00:32.532 --> 00:35.402
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:35.402 --> 00:36.736
WELCOME, I'M JOHN OLIVER

00:36.736 --> 00:37.337
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:37.337 --> 00:39.973
US, IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK

00:39.973 --> 00:41.307
WHICH STARTED IN SPECTACULAR

00:41.307 --> 00:41.541
FASHION

00:41.541 --> 00:42.175
WITH HEIDI KLUM DELIVERING THIS

00:42.175 --> 00:43.643
MASTERPIECE OF A HALLOWEEN

00:43.643 --> 00:44.077
COSTUME.

00:44.077 --> 00:44.644
HEY, HEIDI, HOW ARE YOU?

00:44.644 --> 00:45.078
I'M GREAT.

00:45.078 --> 00:45.545
HOW ARE YOU?

00:45.545 --> 00:46.780
JUST HANGING AROUND OR LAYING

00:46.780 --> 00:47.147
AROUND?

00:47.147 --> 00:47.781
YOU KNOW, JUST LAYING AROUND.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.316
JUST WORMING AROUND, YOU KNOW.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.351
SPECTACULAR.

00:51.351 --> 00:53.253
JUST VERY GOOD.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.020
FROM THE LEVEL OF DETAIL, TO THE

00:54.020 --> 00:55.655
RESPONSE "JUST WORMING AROUND",

00:55.655 --> 00:57.624
TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS LATER

00:57.624 --> 00:58.725
FILMED DANCING IN THE WORM

00:58.725 --> 00:59.592
COSTUME.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.060
AND IT'S BOTH IMPRESSIVE AND

01:01.060 --> 01:02.061
DEPRESSING THAT SHE'S A BETTER

01:02.061 --> 01:03.229
DANCER IN THAT SUIT THAN I AM

01:03.229 --> 01:05.465
COMPLETELY UNENCUMBERED.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.466
IT'S A GOOD LESSON FOR ALL OF

01:06.466 --> 01:08.635
TRY AND BE AS GOOD AT

01:08.635 --> 01:10.270
ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE AS HEIDI

01:10.270 --> 01:12.172
KLUM IS AT HALLOWEEN.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.573
OBVIOUSLY, THOUGH, THERE WAS

01:13.573 --> 01:14.607
OTHER NEWS THIS WEEK, FROM LULA

01:14.607 --> 01:16.075
DEFEATING BOLSONARO IN BRAZIL'S

01:16.075 --> 01:18.144
RUNOFF ELECTION, TO ELON MUSK

01:18.144 --> 01:20.013
MAKING BIG MOVES AS HE STARTS

01:20.013 --> 01:21.481
RUNNING TWITTER, AND POTENTIALLY

01:21.481 --> 01:24.217
INTO THE GROUND.

01:24.217 --> 01:25.652
ADVERTISERS ARE ALREADY STEPPING

01:25.652 --> 01:27.287
AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM, AND HALF

01:27.287 --> 01:29.989
OF THE COMPANY'S WORK FORCE WAS

01:29.989 --> 01:32.492
REPORTEDLY ELIMINATED, WITH SOME

01:32.492 --> 01:33.126
PAINTING A PRETTY BLEAK PICTURE

01:33.126 --> 01:33.893
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE INSIDE THE

01:33.893 --> 01:35.094
COMPANY.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.897
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:37.897 --> 01:39.532
THAT TWITTER EMPLOYEES WANT TO

01:39.532 --> 01:42.135
STRESS IS THAT THE COMPANY IS A

01:42.135 --> 01:43.670
NIGHTMARE RIGHT NOW AND YOU

01:43.670 --> 01:44.637
CANNOT WORK THERE.

01:44.637 --> 01:45.772
AND THE WEBSITE IS BUILT ON

01:45.772 --> 01:46.973
STICKS AND IT MIGHT FALL APART.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.541
WOW.

01:48.541 --> 01:49.409
"IT'S A NIGHTMARE BUILT ON

01:49.409 --> 01:50.043
STICKS AND THE WHOLE THING MIGHT

01:50.043 --> 01:50.677
FALL APART."

01:50.677 --> 01:52.145
THAT SOUNDS LESS LIKE THE

01:52.145 --> 01:52.779
DESCRIPTION OF A VITAL

01:52.779 --> 01:53.780
COMMUNICATION PLATFORM, AND MORE

01:53.780 --> 01:54.781
LIKE TWO OF THE LITTLE PIGS

01:54.781 --> 01:57.350
TALKING SHIT ABOUT THEIR MIDDLE

01:57.350 --> 02:00.453
BROTHER'S HOUSE.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.154
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DIVE

02:01.154 --> 02:03.156
STRAIGHT IN TO OUR MAIN STORY

02:03.156 --> 02:13.399
TONIGHT, WHICH CONCERNS A

02:13.399 --> 02:13.633
VOTING.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.267
PRACTICE THAT WAS ONCE SOLD TO

02:14.267 --> 02:14.868
YOUTH WITH THE SLOGAN, VOTE OR

02:14.868 --> 02:15.568
DIE, AND GIVEN THE STATE OF

02:15.568 --> 02:16.503
POLITICS RIGHT NOW, FOR THE

02:16.503 --> 02:17.804
FIRST TIME, I'M REQUESTING MORE

02:17.804 --> 02:18.338
INFORMATION ON THE SECOND

02:18.338 --> 02:19.639
OPTION.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.640
SPECIFICALLY, WITH THE MIDTERMS

02:20.640 --> 02:21.608
NOW JUST TWO DAYS AWAY, WE

02:21.608 --> 02:22.709
WANTED TO FOCUS ON A DANGEROUS

02:22.709 --> 02:23.309
TREND AMONG REPUBLICAN

02:23.309 --> 02:24.544
CANDIDATES-- DENYING THE

02:24.544 --> 02:25.612
LEGITIMACY OF THE LAST ELECTION.

02:25.612 --> 02:26.679
THE FAKE NEWS, BIG TECH AND

02:26.679 --> 02:28.047
BLUE STATE LIBERALS STOLE THE

02:28.047 --> 02:29.883
ELECTION FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.818
THE 2020 ELECTION WAS A

02:31.818 --> 02:33.686
TOTALLY RIGGED ELECTION.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.121
IN FACT, QUITE FRANKLY, EVERY

02:35.121 --> 02:35.722
ELECTION SINCE I THINK GEORGE

02:35.722 --> 02:36.489
WASHINGTON, THERE'S BEEN SOME

02:36.489 --> 02:37.790
KIND OF A DEFECT IN THE SYSTEM.

02:37.790 --> 02:38.691
YOU COULD SAY BIDEN WON THE

02:38.691 --> 02:39.926
PRESIDENCY KIND OF LIKE O.J IS

02:39.926 --> 02:40.627
INNOCENT.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.995
IT'S THE SAME KIND OF-

02:41.995 --> 02:43.630
I'LL SAY THIS-- THOSE

02:43.630 --> 02:44.464
PEOPLE ARE RIDICULOUS, BUT

02:44.464 --> 02:45.532
THEY'RE HAVING A REALLY GOOD

02:45.532 --> 02:47.400
TIME!

02:47.400 --> 02:48.401
CHECK OUT THIS GUY!

02:48.401 --> 02:49.969
I'VE NEVER BEEN AS HAPPY AS HE

02:49.969 --> 02:50.837
IS HEARING AN O.J.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.006
SIMPSON JOKE IN 2021.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.841
AND I HAVE TWO CHILDREN.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.142
AND THE THING IS, THOSE PEOPLE

02:56.142 --> 02:58.711
ARE NOT ALONE-- A MAJORITY OF

02:58.711 --> 03:00.413
REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR HOUSE,

03:00.413 --> 03:02.782
SENATE, OR KEY STATEWIDE OFFICES

03:02.782 --> 03:04.017
THIS YEAR DENY OR QUESTION THE

03:04.017 --> 03:05.718
2020 ELECTION RESULTS.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.120
AND SOME, LIKE THIS GUY, DENY IT

03:07.120 --> 03:09.155
WHILE TRYING TO ADD A BIT OF

03:12.892 --> 03:13.660
HEY, MIKE COLLINS, HERE, YOUR

03:13.660 --> 03:14.727
PRO-TRUMP AMERICA FIRST TRUCKER,

03:14.727 --> 03:15.461
RUNNING FOR CONGRESS HERE IN

03:15.461 --> 03:16.529
GEORGIA TEN.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.897
WELL, I UNDERSTAND JOE BIDEN WAS

03:17.897 --> 03:18.665
IN TOWN YESTERDAY TO TALK ABOUT

03:18.665 --> 03:20.166
OUR ELECTIONS.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.034
IT SEEMS THAT HE AND KAMALA

03:21.034 --> 03:22.335
HARRIS CALLED ANYONE WHO

03:22.335 --> 03:25.038
DISAGREE WITH THE FEDERAL

03:25.038 --> 03:26.372
HIJACKING OF THIS ELECTION "A

03:26.372 --> 03:28.675
RACIST.' WELL, JOE, I GOT SOME

03:28.675 --> 03:30.310
NEWS FOR YOU.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.911
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT GEORGIANS

03:31.911 --> 03:32.745
REALLY BELIEVE.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.447
SEE, GEORGIANS ARE SICK AND

03:34.447 --> 03:37.183
TIRED OF WEAK-KNEED, SPINELESS

03:37.183 --> 03:38.651
POLITICIANS WHO WON'T FIGHT FOR

03:38.651 --> 03:40.887
TRUMP, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

03:40.887 --> 03:43.590
2020, AND FIX OUR ELECTIONS.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.958
WELL, IF THEY WON'T DO IT, MIKE

03:44.958 --> 03:53.499
COLLINS WILL.

03:53.499 --> 03:54.033
SEND ME TO WASHINGTON.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.338
OKAY, TOO MANY THINGS

03:58.338 --> 03:59.272
TO GET INTO THERE.

03:59.272 --> 04:00.039
YOUR BRAIN WANTS TO FOCUS ON

04:00.039 --> 04:01.107
"PRO-TRUMP AMERICA FIRST TRUCKER

04:01.107 --> 04:01.874
BUT THEN WONDERS, "WHY IS HE

04:01.874 --> 04:03.076
DRESSED LIKE THE WORLD'S

04:03.076 --> 04:05.445
ANGRIEST TARGET EMPLOYEE?

04:05.445 --> 04:06.446
BEFORE NOTICING, "WAIT, IS THAT

04:06.446 --> 04:07.814
A GARBAGE CAN LABELED "VOTING

04:07.814 --> 04:09.916
MACHINE?"

04:09.916 --> 04:12.518
THEN ALSO LABELED "CAST BALLOT',

04:12.518 --> 04:13.786
AS IF THEY KNEW THE FIRST LABEL

04:13.786 --> 04:14.721
WASN'T CONVINCING ANYONE, BUT

04:14.721 --> 04:15.788
THOUGHT THE SECOND ONE MIGHT?

04:15.788 --> 04:16.823
THEN IT TAKES A MINUTE TO FOCUS

04:16.823 --> 04:17.857
ON THE SUBTLE BUT UNMISTAKABLE

04:17.857 --> 04:19.359
EDIT POINT BEFORE THE EXPLOSION,

04:19.359 --> 04:21.861
BREAKING THE ILLUSION THAT WAS

04:21.861 --> 04:23.463
SHOT IN A SINGLE TAKE, THEN

04:23.463 --> 04:28.401
FINALLY YOUR BRAIN SAYS, "HEY,

04:28.401 --> 04:29.068
HE OPENED WITH "JOE BIDEN AND

04:29.068 --> 04:29.602
KAMALA HARRIS THINK I'M A

04:29.602 --> 04:30.236
RACIST;' DID HE EVER CLOSE THAT

04:30.236 --> 04:30.737
LOOP OR NAH?"

04:30.737 --> 04:34.407
AND BRAIN?

04:34.407 --> 04:35.308
ANYWAY, THAT MAN'S COMPLETELY

04:35.308 --> 04:36.442
RIDICULOUS, AND GIVEN THE

04:36.442 --> 04:38.277
DISTRICT WHERE HE'S RUNNING,

04:38.277 --> 04:38.878
HE'S ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO

04:38.878 --> 04:40.046
WIN ON TUESDAY.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.047
BUT IT'S WORTH DWELLING ON THE

04:41.047 --> 04:41.948
PROMISE THAT HE, AND THOSAE

04:41.948 --> 04:43.349
OTHER CANDIDATES, ARE MAKING--

04:43.349 --> 04:46.085
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO "FIX OUR

04:46.085 --> 04:46.953
ELECTIONS."

04:46.953 --> 04:48.488
BECAUSE THAT SPEAKS TO A REAL

04:48.488 --> 04:50.323
PROBLEM, WHICH IS THAT A

04:50.323 --> 04:51.190
TROUBLING NUMBER OF ELECTION

04:51.190 --> 04:52.091
DENIERS ARE RUNNING FOR JOBS

04:52.091 --> 04:52.959
THAT CAN PLAY KEY ROLES IN

04:52.959 --> 04:53.693
ADMINISTERING ELECTIONS IN THEIR

04:53.693 --> 04:55.962
STATES.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.463
IN FACT, OVER HALF THE COUNTRY

04:57.463 --> 04:59.132
HAS AN ELECTION DENIER RUNNING

04:59.132 --> 05:00.600
TO OVERSEE THEIR ELECTIONS, AND

05:00.600 --> 05:01.768
MANY OF THEM ARE EXPECTED TO

05:01.768 --> 05:04.070
WIN.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.171
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE

05:05.171 --> 05:06.406
ABOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION ON THIS

05:06.406 --> 05:08.307
SHOW, WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH

05:08.307 --> 05:09.842
VOTER ID LAWS, FELONY

05:09.842 --> 05:10.910
DISENFRANCHISEMENT,

05:10.910 --> 05:12.412
GERRYMANDERING, OR RESTRICTIONS

05:12.412 --> 05:13.680
ON MAIL-IN VOTING.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.348
BUT THOSE TACTICS ALL TAKE PLACE

05:15.348 --> 05:17.383
BEFORE YOU CAST YOUR BALLOT.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.052
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

05:19.052 --> 05:22.388
ELECTION SUBVERSION-- WHICH

05:22.388 --> 05:23.122
TYPICALLY HAPPENS AFTER THE

05:23.122 --> 05:23.856
VOTES ARE IN.

05:23.856 --> 05:24.457
IT'S A STRATEGY TO NEGATE

05:24.457 --> 05:25.124
LEGITIMATE ELECTION RESULTS BY

05:25.124 --> 05:27.360
SIMPLY REFUSING TO ACCEPT THEM.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.929
TRUMP FAMOUSLY TRIED TO SUBVERT

05:29.929 --> 05:30.563
THE LAST ELECTION.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.465
AND SOME CURRENT CANDIDATES ARE

05:32.465 --> 05:33.766
PROMISING, IF ELECTED, THEY'LL

05:33.766 --> 05:34.667
BE ABLE TO GUARANTEE A CERTAIN

05:34.667 --> 05:35.635
RESULT IN THE FUTURE.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.003
JIM MARCHANT.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.337
AMERICA FIRST SECRETARY OF

05:38.337 --> 05:39.672
STATE COALITION.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.673
AND IF THEY WIN, HE'S BEEN

05:40.673 --> 05:41.674
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THAT

05:41.674 --> 05:43.776
WOULD MEAN.

05:43.776 --> 05:44.477
WHEN MY COALITION OF

05:44.477 --> 05:45.845
SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES

05:45.845 --> 05:46.946
GET ELECTED, WE'RE GONNA FIX THE

05:46.946 --> 05:48.247
WHOLE COUNTRY AND PRESIDENT

05:48.247 --> 05:52.251
TRUMP IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT

05:52.251 --> 05:55.388
AGAIN IN 2024!

05:55.388 --> 05:56.489
YEAH, NO WONDER TRUMP

05:56.489 --> 05:58.424
LIKES THAT MESSAGE.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.792
ALSO IT PROBABLY DOESN'T HURT

05:59.792 --> 06:01.427
THAT IT'S COMING FROM A GUY WHO

06:01.427 --> 06:02.261
LOOKS LIKE A SMALLER, PALER

06:02.261 --> 06:04.464
VERSION OF HIM.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.798
LOOK AT THAT MAN.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.934
HE LOOKS LIKE THE POKEMON THAT

06:07.934 --> 06:09.969
TRUMP EVOLVES FROM.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.838
SO IF THE PLAN IS THIS OVERT,

06:11.838 --> 06:13.639
AND WITH POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES

06:13.639 --> 06:14.707
THIS DIRE FOR THIS ELECTION AND

06:14.707 --> 06:17.410
BEYOND, TONIGHT, LET'S TALK

06:17.410 --> 06:18.811
ABOUT ELECTION SUBVERSION.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.780
AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE

06:20.780 --> 06:21.514
FACING, LET'S REVISIT-- BRIEFLY

06:21.514 --> 06:25.318
SOME OF THE CHAOS FOLLOWING

06:25.318 --> 06:26.853
THE LAST ELECTION.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.221
AS YOU UNDOUBTEDLY REMEMBER,

06:28.221 --> 06:29.722
AFTER TRUMP'S LOSS, HE TRIED A

06:29.722 --> 06:32.458
LOT OF TACTICS TO SWING THINGS

06:32.458 --> 06:34.293
BACK IN HIS FAVOR, INCLUDING

06:34.293 --> 06:34.927
CALLING BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, THE

06:34.927 --> 06:35.528
SECRETARY OF STATE OF GEORGIA,

06:35.528 --> 06:37.430
TO ASK HIM FOR ONE SMALL FAVOR.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.731
SO LOOK, ALL I WANT TO DO IS

06:38.731 --> 06:41.534
THIS.

06:41.534 --> 06:46.873
I JUST WANT TO FIND, UH, 11,780

06:46.873 --> 06:49.242
VOTES, WHICH IS ONE MORE THAN WE

06:49.242 --> 06:50.977
HAVE BECAUSE WE WON THE STATE.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.212
IT'S STILL INCREDIBLE

06:53.212 --> 06:54.580
TO HEAR THAT, AND A COLD CHILL

06:54.580 --> 06:56.249
RAN DOWN MY URETHRA MERELY

06:56.249 --> 06:58.384
HEARING HIS VOICE AGAIN,

06:58.384 --> 06:59.385
SEEMINGLY FORGETTING, AT ONE

06:59.385 --> 07:01.854
POINT, BOTH HOW MANY VOTES HE

07:01.854 --> 07:03.256
NEEDS, AND THE WORD "VOTES."

07:03.256 --> 07:05.258
IT'S AMAZING TO LISTEN TO

07:05.258 --> 07:06.626
SOMEONE ATTEMPT A COUP WITH THE

07:06.626 --> 07:08.027
SAME FOCUSED ENERGY OF A DAD

07:08.027 --> 07:09.328
STRUGGLING TO REMEMBER HIS

07:09.328 --> 07:10.897
FAMILY'S McDONALD'S ORDER.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.099
"YEAH, UM, CAN I GET A SPICY.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.267
CRISPY, "CRUNCHY?" CHICKEN AND

07:14.267 --> 07:15.168
UUUUH.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.102
TWO.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.036
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED

07:17.036 --> 07:18.371
"SON OF BACONATOR' HERE?

07:18.371 --> 07:19.405
ARE YOU THE WHOPPER PLACE OR ARE

07:19.405 --> 07:20.273
YOU THE OTHER ONE?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.774
YEAH, I'M IN THE WRONG PLACE,

07:21.774 --> 07:25.111
OKAY GOT IT, FUCK ME."

07:25.111 --> 07:26.913
NOW, THANKFULLY, RAFFENSPERGER

07:26.913 --> 07:28.581
DECLINED TRUMP'S REQUEST, WHICH

07:28.581 --> 07:29.849
LEFT HIM TO FIGHT HIS BATTLES IN

07:29.849 --> 07:31.050
THE COURTS-- WHERE HE LOST OVER

07:31.050 --> 07:33.019
SIXTY LAWSUITS CHALLENGING THE

07:33.019 --> 07:34.821
ELECTION RESULTS.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.356
HE THEN FAMOUSLY TRIED AT THE

07:37.356 --> 07:38.090
LAST MINUTE, TO BULLY MIKE PENCE

07:38.090 --> 07:39.792
INTO REFUSING TO CERTIFY BIDEN'S

07:39.792 --> 07:41.127
WIN, INCLUDING A PHONE CALL

07:41.127 --> 07:42.195
WHERE TRUMP CALLED HIM A WIMP,

07:42.195 --> 07:45.765
AND "THE P WORD."

07:45.765 --> 07:47.433
WHICH I KNOW IS SUPPOSED TO BE

07:47.433 --> 07:49.569
PUSSY BUT TO BE HONEST, "THE P

07:49.569 --> 07:54.173
WORD SOUNDS LIKE THE PHRASE

07:54.173 --> 07:55.608
GEPPETTO'S THERAPIST USES TO

07:55.608 --> 07:55.875
TALK ABOUT

07:55.875 --> 07:57.910
PINOCCHIO.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.644
AND WHILE I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER

07:58.644 --> 07:59.312
ALL THAT, THERE WERE ALSO

07:59.312 --> 08:00.012
SMALLER, MUCH LESSER-KNOWN

08:00.012 --> 08:01.280
INCIDENTS WHERE PEOPLE FURTHER

08:01.280 --> 08:01.814
DOWN THE CHAIN ALSO TRIED

08:01.814 --> 08:02.415
THUMBING THE SCALE-- LIKE IN

08:02.415 --> 08:03.282
WAYNE COUNTY, MICHIGAN, WHERE

08:03.282 --> 08:04.717
TRUMP SUPPORTERS RAISED BULLSHIT

08:04.717 --> 08:05.117
CLAIMS ABOUT VOTING

08:05.117 --> 08:06.452
IRREGULARITIES IN DETROIT, AND A

08:06.452 --> 08:07.987
REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF THE COUNTY

08:07.987 --> 08:09.555
BOARD OF CANVASSERS THERE

08:09.555 --> 08:12.124
PROPOSED THIS SIMPLE SOLUTION.

08:12.124 --> 08:17.063
I WOULD BE OPEN TO A MOTION

08:17.063 --> 08:19.065
TO- TO CERTIFY COMMUNITIES OTHER

08:19.065 --> 08:20.533
THAN THE CITY OF DETROIT.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.968
THAT MOVE OUTRAGED THE

08:21.968 --> 08:23.336
DEMOCRATS ON THE BOARD, AND

08:23.336 --> 08:24.704
SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER ON THE

08:24.704 --> 08:26.505
BOARD'S PUBLIC ZOOM MEETING.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.207
YOU HAVE EXTRACTED A BLACK

08:28.207 --> 08:30.009
CITY OUT OF A COUNTY, AND YOU

08:30.009 --> 08:32.245
HAVE SAID THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE

08:32.245 --> 08:34.347
AT ISSUE IS THE CITY OF DETROIT,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.548
WHERE 80% OF THE PEOPLE WHO

08:35.548 --> 08:38.351
RESIDE HERE ARE

08:38.351 --> 08:38.751
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

08:38.751 --> 08:39.485
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S

08:39.485 --> 08:40.686
UPSET.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.288
GENERALLY, WHEN A WHITE PERSON

08:42.288 --> 08:43.656
SAYS "I HAVE A COMPROMISE AND

08:43.656 --> 08:45.024
STARTS DOING ELECTORAL FRACTIONS

08:45.024 --> 08:47.193
THAT COUNT BLACK PEOPLE LESS,

08:47.193 --> 08:47.960
THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN GREAT MOMENTS

08:47.960 --> 08:49.595
FOR DEMOCRACY.

08:49.595 --> 08:50.730
NOW SHE LATER CLAIMED THAT SHE

08:50.730 --> 08:56.936
MERELY WANTED MORE

08:56.936 --> 08:57.270
INVESTIGATION

08:57.270 --> 08:58.037
OF THOSE DETROIT VOTES BEFORE

08:58.037 --> 08:58.604
SHE'D AGREE TO CERTIFY THEM.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.472
AND WHILE, AFTER PUSHBACK FROM

08:59.472 --> 09:00.106
MICHIGAN'S GOVERNOR AND

09:00.106 --> 09:01.374
SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE

09:01.374 --> 09:01.941
ULTIMATELY VOTED TO CERTIFY

09:01.941 --> 09:02.808
BIDEN'S WIN, AFTER TRUMP CALLED

09:02.808 --> 09:04.277
HER AND A FELLOW REPUBLICAN

09:04.277 --> 09:05.811
BOARD MEMBER, THEY BOTH TRIED--

09:05.811 --> 09:06.779
UNSUCCESSFULLY-- TO RESCIND

09:06.779 --> 09:09.515
THEIR VOTES.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.851
MEANWHILE, A FEW DAYS LATER, AT

09:11.851 --> 09:12.685
MICHIGAN'S STATE CANVASSING

09:12.685 --> 09:13.552
BOARD, THERE WAS A SIMILAR

09:13.552 --> 09:14.420
STALEMATE.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.988
ITS FOUR MEMBERS WERE EVENLY

09:15.988 --> 09:17.757
SPLIT BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND

09:17.757 --> 09:19.492
REPUBLICANS, ONE OF WHOM REFUSED

09:19.492 --> 09:20.626
TO CERTIFY BIDEN'S WIN.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.495
WHICH MEANT IT WAS ALL ON THIS

09:22.495 --> 09:23.763
GUY TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

09:23.763 --> 09:25.398
WHICH, THANKFULLY, HE DID, WITH

09:25.398 --> 09:28.801
THIS LITTLE SPEECH.

09:28.801 --> 09:29.802
AS JOHN ADAMS ONCE SAID, WE

09:29.802 --> 09:31.671
ARE A GOVERNMENT OF LAW, NOT

09:31.671 --> 09:33.739
MEN.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.840
AND THIS BOARD NEEDS TO ADHERE

09:34.840 --> 09:40.146
TO THAT PRINCIPLE HERE TODAY.

09:40.146 --> 09:43.282
THIS BOARD MUST DO ITS PART TO

09:43.282 --> 09:44.617
UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND

09:44.617 --> 09:46.052
COMPLY WITH OUR LEGAL DUTY TO

09:46.052 --> 09:48.220
CERTIFY THIS ELECTION.

09:48.220 --> 09:52.391
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MOTION.

09:52.391 --> 09:55.728
AND THAT WAS IT.

09:55.728 --> 09:56.729
A BORING GUY WITH GLASSES

09:56.729 --> 09:57.296
QUOTING JOHN ADAMS TO UPHOLD

09:57.296 --> 09:58.130
DEMOCRACY.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.031
I'M JUST SAYING-- GET BRADLEY

09:59.031 --> 10:00.066
WHITFORD IN THERE AND SOME

10:00.066 --> 10:00.900
STIRRING MUSIC, YOU'VE GOT THE

10:00.900 --> 10:01.734
KIND OF SCENE THAT WOULD MAKE

10:01.734 --> 10:03.102
AARON SORKIN CUM UNTIL HE PASSED

10:03.102 --> 10:06.038
OUT.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.407
AND THE THING IS, THOSE ARE

10:08.407 --> 10:08.975
CLEARLY JUST TWO VERY LOCAL

10:08.975 --> 10:09.675
EXAMPLES.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.943
BUT IN STATE AFTER STATE, WE

10:10.943 --> 10:13.079
WERE VERY LUCKY THAT A SMALL

10:13.079 --> 10:14.547
GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN KEY

10:14.547 --> 10:17.149
POSITIONS STOOD FIRM.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.017
ARIZONA'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR

10:18.017 --> 10:19.418
DOUG DUCEY WAS LITERALLY IN THE

10:19.418 --> 10:20.686
MIDDLE OF CERTIFYING HIS STATE'S

10:20.686 --> 10:22.054
WIN FOR BIDEN, WHEN HE GOT A

10:22.054 --> 10:25.124
PHONE CALL FROM TRUMP, BUT PUT

10:25.124 --> 10:25.725
HIS PHONE ASIDE, AND CONTINUED

10:25.725 --> 10:27.193
SIGNING THE PAPERWORK.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.362
WATCHING SOMEONE

10:29.362 --> 10:32.665
SCREEN YOUR CALL IS ONE OF THE

10:32.665 --> 10:33.566
MOST DEVASTATING THINGS A HUMAN

10:33.566 --> 10:35.067
BEING CAN POSSIBLY EXPERIENCE

10:35.067 --> 10:36.936
AND I'M SO GLAD IT HAPPENED TO

10:36.936 --> 10:39.071
DONALD TRUMP.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.073
THE GUARDRAILS THAT

10:41.073 --> 10:42.508
PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY WERE

10:42.508 --> 10:44.210
HEAVILY TESTED IN 2020, AND

10:44.210 --> 10:45.911
WHILE SOME MAJOR WEAKNESSES WERE

10:45.911 --> 10:49.715
EXPOSED, THEY THANKFULLY HELD.

10:49.715 --> 10:50.916
BUT SINCE THEN, THERE'S BEEN A

10:50.916 --> 10:51.851
CONCERTED EFFORT TO ATTACK THE

10:51.851 --> 10:53.219
PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS THAT GOT

10:53.219 --> 10:54.587
IN TRUMP'S WAY, SHIFTING THE

10:54.587 --> 10:56.088
LANDSCAPE IN WAYS THAT COULD

10:56.088 --> 10:58.591
MAKE FUTURE SUBVERSION ATTEMPTS

10:58.591 --> 11:00.092
EVEN MORE DANGEROUS.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.827
FOR ONE THING, THE FERVOR AROUND

11:01.827 --> 11:03.295
ELECTION FRAUD HAS BEEN

11:03.295 --> 11:04.964
STUBBORNLY PERSISTENT, WITH A

11:04.964 --> 11:06.665
RECENT POLL SHOWING SIXTY-ONE

11:06.665 --> 11:08.067
PERCENT OF REPUBLICANS BELIEVE

11:08.067 --> 11:09.635
JOE BIDEN ONLY WON DUE TO VOTER

11:09.635 --> 11:12.671
FRAUD.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.806
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS, GIVEN

11:13.806 --> 11:14.707
THAT-- AGAIN-- THERE'S NO

11:14.707 --> 11:16.575
EVIDENCE OF THAT.

11:16.575 --> 11:17.576
MULTIPLE STATES HAD EXHAUSTIVE

11:17.576 --> 11:19.412
RECOUNTS.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.048
THIS HAS BEEN LITIGATED.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.349
THIS JUST ISN'T ONE OF THOSE

11:23.349 --> 11:25.851
UNKNOWABLE THINGS THAT WILL

11:25.851 --> 11:26.419
NEVER GET RESOLVED LIKE WHICH

11:26.419 --> 11:27.119
ONE OF THE TELETUBBIES-- WHEN

11:27.119 --> 11:28.654
COOKED PROPERLY-- WOULD TASTE

11:28.654 --> 11:30.189
BEST.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.024
THAT WE'LL NEVER KNOW!

11:32.024 --> 11:33.392
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

11:33.392 --> 11:34.460
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I'M THINKING,

11:34.460 --> 11:35.928
TOO.

11:35.928 --> 11:41.534
SHOULD WE ALL SAY IT AT ONCE?

11:41.534 --> 11:42.968
PO.

11:42.968 --> 11:43.769
EXACTLY.

11:43.769 --> 11:46.739
OF COURSE IT'S PO.

11:46.739 --> 11:47.640
EVERY ONE OF US IS PRETTY SURE

11:47.640 --> 11:48.507
THAT ON A RAINY DAY IN JANUARY

11:48.507 --> 11:49.608
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WOULD TASTE

11:49.608 --> 11:50.443
BETTER THAN SOME BRAISED PO OVER

11:50.443 --> 11:51.477
RICE.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.379
WITH SOME GINGER?

11:53.379 --> 11:54.947
WITH SOME WINE?!

11:54.947 --> 11:55.581
OF COURSE EVERYONE'S PRETTY SURE

11:55.581 --> 11:56.482
THAT A PO THAT SIMMERS FOR AN

11:56.482 --> 11:57.750
HOUR AND A HALF AFTER GETTING

11:57.750 --> 11:58.284
PROPERLY BLANCHED AND

11:58.284 --> 11:59.151
CARAMELIZED WOULD MELT IN YOUR

11:59.151 --> 12:00.386
MOUTH ON THAT JANUARY SUNDAY,

12:00.386 --> 12:03.889
YUM.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.891
BUT PRETTY SURE ISN'T SURE, IS

12:05.891 --> 12:06.358
IT?

12:06.358 --> 12:07.059
WE'LL NEVER DEFINITIVELY KNOW

12:07.059 --> 12:07.927
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EAT

12:07.927 --> 12:08.794
TELETUBBIES-- THERE ARE LAWS,

12:08.794 --> 12:09.762
APPARENTLY-- SO ALL WE'RE LEFT

12:09.762 --> 12:10.896
WITH IS GUT INSTINCT.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.265
UNLIKE ELECTION RESULTS, WHICH

12:13.265 --> 12:14.667
ARE ACTUALLY VERIFIED.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.937
SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN, YOU

12:17.937 --> 12:19.672
TASTY PLUMP CLOWN, OR I'LL HAVE

12:19.672 --> 12:20.439
YOUR THICK SALTED THIGHS FOR MY

12:20.439 --> 12:25.010
CHRISTMAS FEAST.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.645
BUT THE THING IS, IF YOU'RE NOT

12:26.645 --> 12:28.948
A REGULAR CONSUMER OF

12:28.948 --> 12:29.815
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA, YOU MAY NOT

12:29.815 --> 12:34.019
REALIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH

12:34.019 --> 12:34.920
"BIDEN STOLE THE ELECTION" HAS

12:34.920 --> 12:35.588
TAKEN HOLD, AND ON THE BASIS OF

12:35.588 --> 12:39.091
INCREDIBLY FLIMSY EVIDENCE--

12:39.091 --> 12:41.093
PERHAPS BEST EXEMPLIFIED BY

12:41.093 --> 12:42.027
"2000 MULES", A "DOCUMENTARY

12:42.027 --> 12:44.196
FROM CONSERVATIVE BULLSHIT

12:44.196 --> 12:45.297
ARTIST DINESH D'SOUZA, WHICH IS

12:45.297 --> 12:47.399
WALL TO WALL NONSENSE.

12:47.399 --> 12:48.601
THE 2020 ELECTIONS WERE ONE

12:48.601 --> 12:50.269
OF THE MOST CORRUPT IN HISTORY.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.872
SEE THE PROOF FOR YOURSELF.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.340
WE TRACKED 2,000 MULES MAKING

12:54.340 --> 12:55.508
MULTIPLE BALLOT DROPS.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.910
2000 MULES-- THE SHOCKING

12:57.910 --> 12:59.512
NEW MOVIE FROM DINESH D'SOUZA.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.181
PHILADELPHIA ALONE, WE'VE

13:02.181 --> 13:05.451
IDENTIFIED MORE THAN 1100 MULES.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.820
WHAT IS A MULE?

13:07.820 --> 13:08.687
A PERSON PICKING UP BALLOTS

13:08.687 --> 13:09.522
AND RUNNING THEM TO THE DROP

13:09.522 --> 13:11.423
BOXES.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.291
THIS IS NOT GRANDMA OUT

13:12.291 --> 13:13.425
WALKING HER DOG.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.428
BAD BACKGROUND, BAD REPUTATIONS.

13:16.428 --> 13:17.696
OOH, SO INTENSE!

13:17.696 --> 13:19.231
MYSTERIOUS HAND-OFFS IN DARK

13:19.231 --> 13:20.900
ALLEYS, PEOPLE WITH BAD

13:20.900 --> 13:22.334
REPUTATIONS-- IT'S NICE THAT WE

13:22.334 --> 13:23.669
FINALLY HAVE AN ANSWER TO THE

13:23.669 --> 13:24.904
QUESTION "WHAT IF THE WIRE WAS

13:24.904 --> 13:27.373
CREATED BY VIRGINS?"

13:27.373 --> 13:32.444
THE CENTRAL IDEA OF THE MOVIE IS

13:32.444 --> 13:33.913
THE CLAIM THERE WERE VOTE MULES

13:33.913 --> 13:34.513
WHO REPEATEDLY VISITED BALLOT

13:34.513 --> 13:36.282
BOXES AND DEPOSITED SUSPECT

13:36.282 --> 13:37.216
BALLOTS-- AND THAT DINESH AND

13:37.216 --> 13:38.584
HIS FRIENDS HAVE IDENTIFIED

13:38.584 --> 13:40.486
THEM, USING CELLPHONE DATA.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.688
IT'D TAKE THE REST OF THIS SHOW

13:42.688 --> 13:44.290
TO DEBUNK THE MOVIE'S CLAIMS

13:44.290 --> 13:46.258
POINT BY POINT, BUT VERY

13:46.258 --> 13:48.260
THERE IS NO WAY BY JUST

13:48.260 --> 13:49.762
USING CELLPHONE DATA TO KNOW

13:49.762 --> 13:51.263
WHETHER SOMEONE VISITED A DROP

13:51.263 --> 13:53.132
BOX OR WAS JUST IN THE VICINITY

13:53.132 --> 13:54.400
OF ONE, PARTICULARLY SINCE THOSE

13:54.400 --> 13:55.267
BOXES WERE INSTALLED IN

13:55.267 --> 13:57.102
HIGH-TRAFFIC AREAS.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.804
MEANWHILE, THE ONLY MAP THAT

13:58.804 --> 14:01.373
SEEMS TO SHOW SOMEONE DRIVING

14:01.373 --> 14:02.641
AROUND DUMPING BALLOTS IS FAKE,

14:02.641 --> 14:04.243
AND ANOTHER MAP SUPPOSEDLY

14:04.243 --> 14:05.411
SHOWING A DROP BOX SITE IS

14:05.411 --> 14:07.112
ACTUALLY A STOCK PHOTO OF

14:07.112 --> 14:09.048
MOSCOW, WITH A THIRD ONE JUST

14:09.048 --> 14:10.182
THE SAME MOSCOW MAP AGAIN BUT

14:10.182 --> 14:12.851
ROTATED NINETY DEGREES.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.255
AND FINALLY, THE WHOLE THEORY

14:16.255 --> 14:17.056
RESTS ON THESE MULES REPEATEDLY

14:17.056 --> 14:18.657
GOING TO MULTIPLE DROP BOXES,

14:18.657 --> 14:20.392
BUT WHILE THEY SHOW LOTS OF

14:20.392 --> 14:21.860
FOOTAGE OF DROP BOXES WITHIN THE

14:21.860 --> 14:23.495
MOVIE, NONE OF THEM SHOW THE

14:23.495 --> 14:25.164
SAME PERSON MORE THAN ONCE.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.999
INSTEAD, THE FILMMAKERS

14:26.999 --> 14:28.000
BREATHLESSLY SCRUTINIZE FOOTAGE

14:28.000 --> 14:30.569
FOR CLUES THEY CLAIM-- WITH

14:30.569 --> 14:32.471
ZERO PROOF-- ARE EVIDENCE OF

14:32.471 --> 14:33.706
CRIME, INCLUDING VOTERS WEARING

14:33.706 --> 14:36.141
GLOVES-- Y'KNOW, DURING A

14:36.141 --> 14:37.743
PANDEMIC-- OR TAKING PHOTOS AS

14:37.743 --> 14:39.678
THEY DEPOSIT THEIR BALLOT.

14:39.678 --> 14:40.879
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A FULL

14:40.879 --> 14:41.780
MINUTE FROM THE MOVIE WHERE THEY

14:41.780 --> 14:43.515
WORK THEMSELVES UP OVER

14:43.515 --> 14:44.850
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

14:44.850 --> 14:45.918
OKAY, THE NEXT ONE.

14:45.918 --> 14:46.352
YEAH.

14:46.352 --> 14:49.755
LET ME SHOW YOU DOG GUY.

14:49.755 --> 14:50.889
SO DOG GUY.

14:50.889 --> 14:51.957
MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

14:51.957 --> 14:52.691
THIS IS ACTUALLY AT A POLLING

14:52.691 --> 14:54.493
PLACE.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.095
SO THE PEOPLE IN LINE ARE

14:56.095 --> 14:57.763
WAITING TO GO IN AND VOTE EARLY.

14:57.763 --> 15:00.132
THEY'RE DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY.

15:00.132 --> 15:01.233
OKAY, NOW-NOW YOU'VE GOT SOME

15:01.233 --> 15:03.636
OTHER PEOPLE GONNA WALK UP.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.503
THIS LADY DOESN'T CARE.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.771
BUT THIS GUY, THIS NEXT GUY

15:05.771 --> 15:06.905
CARED.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.708
HE'S WATCHING THE WHOLE THING.

15:09.708 --> 15:10.876
THAT GUY LOOKS AND TALKS TO HIM.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.345
HE'S GOT THE BALLOTS UNDER

15:13.345 --> 15:13.946
HIS ARM ALREADY, NOW HE'S GOT

15:13.946 --> 15:14.580
THE REST THAT HE PULLED OUT OF

15:14.580 --> 15:16.815
THE BAG.

15:16.815 --> 15:17.983
AND HE'S GOING TO GET HIS

15:17.983 --> 15:19.318
CAMERA READY TO TAKE THE

15:19.318 --> 15:20.085
PICTURES AS HE PUTS THEM IN

15:20.085 --> 15:21.387
THERE.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.755
IF YOU CONSIDER THE BRAZENNESS

15:22.755 --> 15:23.622
OF THIS, RIGHT, THIS IS THE

15:23.622 --> 15:24.556
MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.292
THERE'S PEOPLE SITTING THERE

15:26.292 --> 15:27.993
WATCHING YOU CHEAT.

15:27.993 --> 15:28.961
PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING IT THE

15:28.961 --> 15:30.496
RIGHT WAY.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.198
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM

15:33.198 --> 15:34.133
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO EXCEPT

15:34.133 --> 15:34.700
OBSERVE AND MAYBE SAY WHAT'S

15:34.700 --> 15:35.367
GOING ON?

15:35.367 --> 15:36.969
WHAT DID I JUST SEE?

15:36.969 --> 15:39.071
THEY WONDER, WHAT DOES THIS

15:39.071 --> 15:40.572
ALL EVEN MEAN?

15:40.572 --> 15:41.407
IF THIS IS HAPPENING IN BROAD

15:41.407 --> 15:41.974
DAYLIGHT AND NOBODY IS DOING

15:41.974 --> 15:44.576
ANYTHING TO STOP IT?

15:44.576 --> 15:45.210
BUT THAT'S NOT DAMNING

15:45.210 --> 15:46.745
EVIDENCE.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.914
THAT IS FULLY NOT ANYTHING.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.984
IT IS JUST SOMEONE VOTING.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.786
AND WE NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY

15:53.786 --> 15:54.653
CLEAR ON SOMETHING, THE GUY IN

15:54.653 --> 15:56.121
LINE THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT?

15:56.121 --> 15:56.955
WHO'S SUPPOSEDLY SHOCKED ABOUT

15:56.955 --> 15:57.890
THE VOTER FRAUD HE'S WITNESSING?

15:57.890 --> 16:00.292
HE'S LOOKING AT THE DOG.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.661
AS ANYONE WOULD.

16:02.661 --> 16:03.862
THE ONLY REASON I CAN FOCUS ON

16:03.862 --> 16:05.097
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE RIGHT NOW

16:05.097 --> 16:07.633
IS BECAUSE THEY, THANKFULLY,

16:07.633 --> 16:08.967
BLURRED THE DOG, OTHERWISE I,

16:08.967 --> 16:10.669
LIKE HIM, WOULD BE GAWKING AT IT

16:10.669 --> 16:11.603
AND ASKING WHO'S A GOOD BOY

16:11.603 --> 16:14.006
UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSED.

16:14.006 --> 16:16.108
THIS MOVIE IS ASTONISHINGLY

16:16.108 --> 16:18.777
DUMB, BUT HAS A REAL FOLLOWING.

16:18.777 --> 16:19.878
FIFTY CANDIDATES HAVE PROMOTED

16:19.878 --> 16:21.246
OR CITED IT.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.815
AND IT-- AND CONSPIRACY

16:22.815 --> 16:30.689
THEORIES LIKE IT-- HAVE WHIPPED

16:30.689 --> 16:32.891
UP A SEA OF PERVASIVE DISTRUST.

16:32.891 --> 16:33.892
WITH DENIERS NOW CHANNELING THAT

16:33.892 --> 16:34.560
FEVER TO BURROW IN TO EVERY

16:34.560 --> 16:35.894
LEVEL OF THE ELECTION PROCESS.

16:35.894 --> 16:36.929
TAKE THE VERY LOWEST ONE,

16:36.929 --> 16:37.629
PRECINCTS-- SMALL,

16:37.629 --> 16:38.297
NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL UNITS

16:38.297 --> 16:39.732
CENTERED AROUND POLLING PLACES.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.667
POLITICAL PARTIES ORGANIZE IN

16:41.667 --> 16:42.501
PRECINCTS, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

16:42.501 --> 16:43.369
HIRE AND RECRUIT POLL WORKERS

16:43.369 --> 16:45.337
THERE.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.605
TRUMP'S ALLIES HAVE BEEN WORKING

16:46.605 --> 16:47.973
HARD TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

16:47.973 --> 16:50.075
WELL-REPRESENTED AT THAT LEVEL

16:50.075 --> 16:53.412
PARTICUARLY STEVE BANNON,

16:53.412 --> 17:00.552
PICTURED HERE-- DROWNED-- WHO

17:00.552 --> 17:01.954
HAS MADE HIS PRECINCT STRATEGY A

17:02.354 --> 17:02.955
WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW THE

17:02.955 --> 17:03.856
WAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS

17:03.856 --> 17:04.490
STRUCTURED IS THAT YOU CAN GO TO

17:04.490 --> 17:05.724
A PRECINCT BECOME A PRECINCT

17:05.724 --> 17:06.392
COMMITTEEMAN AND THEN YOU'VE GOT

17:06.392 --> 17:07.393
REAL- THEN YOU'VE GOT REAL

17:07.393 --> 17:08.293
STANDING.

17:08.293 --> 17:09.728
WE'RE BUILDING AN ARMY OF THE

17:09.728 --> 17:11.730
AWAKENED AND WE ARE TAKING OVER

17:11.730 --> 17:13.499
PRECINCT STRATEGIES, WE'RE

17:13.499 --> 17:17.102
TAKING OVER ELECTION BOARDS,

17:17.102 --> 17:17.803
CANVASSING BOARDS

17:17.803 --> 17:18.904
WE'RE FLOODING THE ZONE WITH

17:18.904 --> 17:19.972
POLL WORKERS, POLL WATCHERS,

17:19.972 --> 17:20.572
ELECTION JUDGES, PEOPLE IN THE

17:20.572 --> 17:22.608
ROOM.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.442
IT'S GOING TO BE MAGA IN THE

17:23.442 --> 17:24.977
ROOM, COUNTING THE VOTES,

17:24.977 --> 17:25.711
BECAUSE ONLY MAGA CAN COUNT

17:25.711 --> 17:27.513
FAIR.

17:27.513 --> 17:33.385
OKAY, SET ASIDE "ONLY

17:33.385 --> 17:34.286
MAGA CAN COUNT FAIR"-- JUST

17:34.286 --> 17:34.953
SPARE A MOMENT FOR HIS ROOM

17:34.953 --> 17:36.121
DECOR, WHICH FEATURES AN ACTUAL

17:36.121 --> 17:37.322
SIGN READING "THERE ARE NO

17:37.322 --> 17:45.330
CONSPIRACIES, BUT THERE ARE NO

17:45.330 --> 17:45.998
COINCIDENCES" A QUOTE ATTRIBUTED

17:45.998 --> 17:46.765
TO STEPHEN K.

17:46.765 --> 17:47.366
BANNON.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.367
AND WHILE YOU MIGHT THINK

17:48.367 --> 17:49.334
THERE'S NOTHING DOUCHIER THAN

17:49.334 --> 17:49.968
QUOTING YOURSELF, IT TURNS OUT,

17:49.968 --> 17:50.736
YOU'RE WRONG-- IT'S DOING THAT

17:50.736 --> 17:51.637
WHILE ALSO SLYLY TRYING TO GIVE

17:51.637 --> 17:52.471
YOUR NAME A FANCY MAKEOVER.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.338
"STEPHEN K BANNON"?

17:53.338 --> 17:54.373
PLEASE, STEVE.

17:54.373 --> 17:55.774
NO ONE'S BUYING THAT.

17:55.774 --> 17:56.542
PLUS, WE LOOKED AND THE K IS FOR

17:56.542 --> 17:58.210
KEVIN.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.411
YOU'RE JUST MAKING YOUR NAME

17:59.411 --> 18:01.113
EVEN SADDER.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.147
BUT BANNON'S STRATEGY SEEMS TO

18:02.147 --> 18:03.715
HAVE PAID OFF.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.150
PROPUBLICA FOUND LAST YEAR THAT,

18:05.150 --> 18:07.352
IN 41 KEY BATTLEGROUND COUNTIES,

18:07.352 --> 18:09.254
THERE WERE AT LEAST 8500 NEW

18:09.254 --> 18:11.023
REPUBLICAN PRECINCT OFFICERS OR

18:11.023 --> 18:12.558
EQUIVALENT OFFICIALS, WITH NO

18:12.558 --> 18:13.425
SIMILAR SURGE FROM THE

18:13.425 --> 18:14.326
DEMOCRATS.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.394
BANNON AND OTHER REPUBLICANS

18:15.394 --> 18:16.728
HAVE ALSO BEEN ENCOURAGING

18:16.728 --> 18:18.030
PEOPLE TO TAKE ON JOBS IN

18:18.030 --> 18:19.598
POLLING STATIONS, WHILE ISSUING

18:19.598 --> 18:21.066
SOME TROUBLING ADVICE.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.334
AT ONE TRAINING SESSION FOR POLL

18:22.334 --> 18:23.402
WORKERS AND WATCHERS IN

18:23.402 --> 18:25.504
MICHIGAN, RUN BY A REPUBLICAN

18:25.504 --> 18:26.905
ACTIVIST GROUP, PARTICIPANTS

18:26.905 --> 18:28.640
WERE TOLD TO CALL 911 AND

18:28.640 --> 18:30.342
CONTACT SHERIFFS TO INVOLVE LAW

18:30.342 --> 18:31.743
ENFORCEMENT IN ANY

18:31.743 --> 18:33.045
ELECTION-RELATED COMPLAINTS.

18:33.045 --> 18:38.350
WHICH ISN'T GREAT.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.420
YOU SHOULD CLEARLY ONLY CALL

18:41.420 --> 18:44.256
9-1-1 WITH AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY,

18:44.256 --> 18:44.790
LIKE A CAR ACCIDENT OR A

18:44.790 --> 18:45.624
BREAK-IN OR WHEN SOMEONE TAKES

18:45.624 --> 18:46.291
OFF THEIR SHOES "AND SOCKS ON A

18:46.291 --> 18:46.892
PLANE.

18:46.892 --> 18:47.860
"HI, YES, I KNOW WE'RE IN THE

18:47.860 --> 18:48.494
SKY, BUT I'M ASKING YOU TO GET A

18:48.494 --> 18:49.094
POLICE HELICOPTER AND SHOOT.

18:49.094 --> 18:49.795
US.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.762
DOWN."

18:50.762 --> 18:52.197
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING ELECTION

18:52.197 --> 18:53.699
SUPERVISORS WON'T STAND FOR

18:53.699 --> 18:54.233
SHENANIGANS LIKE THAT, YOU

18:54.233 --> 18:55.667
SHOULD KNOW-- MANY HAVE BEEN

18:55.667 --> 18:56.935
DRIVEN AWAY.

18:56.935 --> 18:58.270
ONE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT IN

18:58.270 --> 18:59.304
FIVE HIGHLY CONTESTED

18:59.304 --> 19:00.539
BATTLEGROUND STATES, ROUGHLY ONE

19:00.539 --> 19:02.107
IN THREE TOP ELECTION

19:02.107 --> 19:03.675
ADMINISTRATORS LEFT THE JOB

19:03.675 --> 19:06.245
AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION.

19:06.245 --> 19:07.779
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE KIND

19:07.779 --> 19:09.081
OF PERSONAL MESSAGES SOME

19:09.081 --> 19:10.282
RECEIVED LAST TIME, YOU DO

19:10.282 --> 19:11.783
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MIGHT NOT

19:11.783 --> 19:13.652
WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.520
THIS ELECTION IS F-ING

19:14.520 --> 19:16.121
RIGGED.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.258
YOU ALL KNOW IT.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.359
AND YOU ARE COMPLICIT AS F.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.127
YOU LIED.

19:22.127 --> 19:25.364
YOU'RE A TRAITOR.

19:25.364 --> 19:31.236
PERHAPS CUTS AND BULLETS WILL

19:31.236 --> 19:31.837
SOON ARRIVE.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.504
GAVE MY ADDRESS.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.238
HEY, RICK.

19:33.238 --> 19:33.972
234 YEARS AGO, THE FOUNDING

19:33.972 --> 19:34.940
CAUCASIAN FATHERS OF AMERICA

19:34.940 --> 19:36.675
GAVE US THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.510
TIME'S RUNNING OUT, RICHARD.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.513
WE'RE COMING AFTER YOU AND EVERY

19:41.513 --> 19:43.048
MOTHERFUCKER THAT STOLE THIS

19:43.048 --> 19:44.850
ELECTION WITH OUR SECOND

19:44.850 --> 19:48.854
AMENDMENT, SUBPOENAS BE DAMNED.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.089
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SERVED LEAD,

19:51.089 --> 19:51.723
YOU FUCKING-FUCKING ENIMAL-ENEMY

19:51.723 --> 19:53.559
COMMUNIST--

19:53.559 --> 19:54.927
HOLY SHIT, THOSE ARE

19:54.927 --> 20:00.599
HORRIFYING.

20:00.599 --> 20:01.300
AND FOUNDING CAUCASIAN FATHERS

20:01.300 --> 20:02.601
IS A HELL OF A PHRASE.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.403
BECAUSE IT EITHER COMES FROM THE

20:04.403 --> 20:05.771
MOUTH OF A RACIST, OR SOMEONE

20:05.771 --> 20:06.872
WITH STRONG OPINIONS ON THE

20:06.872 --> 20:08.574
CASTING DECISIONS IN "HAMILTON",

20:08.574 --> 20:12.077
BECAUSE THEY ARE RACIST.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.145
REUTERS ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED MORE

20:13.145 --> 20:14.613
THAN 900 THREATS MADE AGAINST

20:14.613 --> 20:15.547
ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS SINCE

20:15.547 --> 20:16.848
THE LAST ELECTION.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.517
SO IT'S NO WONDER SO MANY

20:18.517 --> 20:20.352
QUALIFIED PEOPLE ARE LEAVING.

20:20.352 --> 20:21.486
AND THEIR REPLACEMENTS ARE

20:21.486 --> 20:27.659
SOMETIMES TROUBLING.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.493
TAKE NYE COUNTY, NEVADA, WHERE

20:28.493 --> 20:29.361
THEIR TOP COUNTY ELECTION

20:29.361 --> 20:29.962
OFFICIAL WAS REPLACED BY THIS

20:29.962 --> 20:31.363
GUY, MARK KAMPF, WHO'S NOT ONLY

20:31.363 --> 20:32.598
SAID HE BELIEVES TRUMP WON THE

20:32.598 --> 20:33.565
2020 ELECTION, HE'S ALSO

20:33.565 --> 20:36.168
PROMOTED "2000 MULES", AND HAS

20:36.168 --> 20:37.703
AMPLIFIED SOME OF THE BASELESS

20:37.703 --> 20:38.704
HYSTERIA AROUND DOMINION VOTING

20:38.704 --> 20:39.771
MACHINES.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.306
AND LOOK-- WE'VE ADDRESSED

20:41.306 --> 20:41.940
VOTING MACHINES BEFORE ON THIS

20:41.940 --> 20:43.275
SHOW.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.376
THEY DO HAVE SOME

20:44.376 --> 20:45.844
VULNERABILITIES.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.279
BUT IMPORTANTLY, THOSE

20:47.279 --> 20:48.447
VULNERABILITIES CAN BE

20:48.447 --> 20:49.982
COUNTERACTED BY HAVING A

20:49.982 --> 20:51.450
PHYSICAL PAPER TRAIL, AND DOING

20:51.450 --> 20:53.418
RISK-LIMITING AUDITS AFTER THE

20:53.418 --> 20:54.019
FACT.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.787
ALSO THERE'S NO PROOF THAT ANY

20:55.787 --> 21:01.460
MACHINES HAVE EVER BEEN

21:01.460 --> 21:02.394
COMPROMISED IN A U.S. ELECTION.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.395
BUT KAMPF DEFENDS ELECTION

21:03.395 --> 21:04.296
DENIERS-- AND WON'T BUDGE ON IT

21:04.296 --> 21:05.464
WHEN PRESSED.

21:05.464 --> 21:06.665
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE

21:06.665 --> 21:08.600
SYSTEM WAS LEGITIMATE IN 2020

21:08.600 --> 21:10.936
AND CREATED AN ERROR WHERE

21:10.936 --> 21:13.005
30,000-PLUS VOTES WERE NOT

21:13.005 --> 21:14.673
COUNTED IN THE STATE CORRECTLY,

21:14.673 --> 21:17.142
ISN'T THAT PROBLEMATIC?

21:17.142 --> 21:18.110
I DON'T SEE AS BEING

21:18.110 --> 21:19.544
PROBLEMATIC AT ALL, BECAUSE I'M

21:19.544 --> 21:21.546
TRYING TO INCREASE VOTER

21:21.546 --> 21:23.715
CONFIDENCE IN THE ELECTION.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.017
IN THE ELECTION SPACE, THE

21:25.017 --> 21:26.218
MACHINES THAT COUNT GO THROUGH

21:26.218 --> 21:27.152
MULTIPLE LAYERS OF SECURITY.

21:27.152 --> 21:28.520
THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE

21:28.520 --> 21:30.155
INTERNET.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.289
AND THIS IS REGULATED THROUGHOUT

21:31.289 --> 21:32.724
THE COUNTRY.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.293
THAT'S-THAT'S A PERSPECTIVE.

21:35.293 --> 21:37.763
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE-AGAIN,

21:37.763 --> 21:38.430
THE VOTERS IN THIS COUNTY DON'T

21:38.430 --> 21:40.365
BELIEVE THAT.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.667
AND WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT,

21:41.667 --> 21:42.367
THEIR PERCEPTION IS THEIR

21:42.367 --> 21:47.539
REALITY.

21:47.539 --> 21:50.008
WOW.

21:50.008 --> 21:50.809
WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT, THEIR

21:50.809 --> 21:51.677
PERCEPTION IS THEIR REALITY.

21:51.677 --> 21:52.577
I GOTTA SAY, THAT'S A RISKY

21:52.577 --> 22:05.290
STANCE FOR A GUY WHOSE NAME IS

22:05.290 --> 22:07.392
ALMOST MEIN KAMPF.

22:07.392 --> 22:07.993
AGAIN, IT'S LITERALLY NOT, BUT

22:07.993 --> 22:08.960
I'VE SEEN HIS NAME WRITTEN DOWN

22:08.960 --> 22:09.728
HUNDREDS OF TIMES WHILE WORKING

22:09.728 --> 22:10.962
ON THIS PIECE AND EVERY TIME, MY

22:10.962 --> 22:11.596
BRAIN AUTOCORRECTS IT TO MEIN

22:11.596 --> 22:12.197
KAMPF AND, EVENTUALLY, MY

22:12.197 --> 22:13.098
PERCEPTION WILL BECOME REALITY.

22:13.098 --> 22:14.232
I'M JUST SAYING, IF MY LAST NAME

22:14.232 --> 22:15.567
WERE KAMPF, I DEFINITELY

22:15.567 --> 22:16.501
WOULDN'T GIVE MY BABY A FOUR

22:16.501 --> 22:17.335
LETTER NAME THAT STARTS WITH AN

22:17.335 --> 22:18.036
M.

22:18.036 --> 22:25.343
IT'D BE LIKE MEETING SOMEONE

22:25.343 --> 22:25.877
NAMED EARL HARBOR.

22:25.877 --> 22:26.678
IT FEELS LIKE THEIR PARENTS WENT

22:26.678 --> 22:27.746
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO FUCK WITH

22:27.746 --> 22:28.780
THEM AND ALL OF US.

22:28.780 --> 22:29.481
KAMPF HAS SUGGESTED THAT ALL

22:29.481 --> 22:30.515
BALLOTS SHOULD NOW BE

22:30.515 --> 22:31.817
HAND-COUNTED.

22:31.817 --> 22:32.684
BUT EXPERTS WILL TELL YOU THAT,

22:32.684 --> 22:33.585
WHILE HAND COUNTING IS AN

22:33.585 --> 22:34.853
IMPORTANT TOOL IN RECOUNTS AND

22:34.853 --> 22:36.521
AUDITS, AS A WAY OF VERIFYING

22:36.521 --> 22:37.923
THE MACHINE COUNT, TALLYING

22:37.923 --> 22:39.424
ENTIRE ELECTIONS BY HAND WOULD

22:39.424 --> 22:41.026
CAUSE CHAOS AND MAKE RESULTS

22:41.026 --> 22:43.395
LESS ACCURATE, NOT MORE.

22:43.395 --> 22:45.097
AND SURE ENOUGH, EARLY VOTING IN

22:45.097 --> 22:54.506
THAT COUNTY HAS BEEN A

22:54.506 --> 22:55.340
SPECTACULAR MESS, WITH THE A.P.

22:55.340 --> 22:56.241
PEOPLE SPENDING ABOUT THREE

22:56.241 --> 22:57.209
HOURS EACH COUNTING 50 BALLOTS,

22:57.209 --> 22:58.076
WITH MISMATCHED TALLIES LEADING

22:58.076 --> 22:59.144
TO RECOUNTS, AND OCCASIONALLY

22:59.144 --> 23:00.378
MORE RECOUNTS, AND ONE VOLUNTEER

23:00.378 --> 23:02.080
LAMENTING, "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S

23:02.080 --> 23:02.981
TAKING TWO HOURS TO GET THROUGH

23:02.981 --> 23:05.684
25 BALLOTS."

23:05.684 --> 23:07.052
YEAH-- IF ONLY THERE WAS A

23:07.052 --> 23:08.086
MACHINE THAT COULD HELP YOU GUYS

23:08.086 --> 23:10.989
WITH THAT.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.524
AND THAT'S JUST ONE ELECTION

23:12.524 --> 23:13.925
DENIER AT A LOW LEVEL WREAKING

23:13.925 --> 23:15.093
HAVOC.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.896
WE COULD BE IN FOR A LOT WORSE.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.499
ARIZONA, A STATE BIDEN WON BY AN

23:20.499 --> 23:22.634
EXTREMELY NARROW MARGIN, BUT

23:22.634 --> 23:23.835
THANKS TO THEIR THEN-GOVERNOR

23:23.835 --> 23:25.604
DOING ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL

23:25.604 --> 23:27.272
CALL-SCREENINGS OF ALL TIME,

23:27.272 --> 23:30.208
THINGS PROCEEDED SMOOTHLY.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.245
BUT HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT NOW, AND

23:33.245 --> 23:33.779
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE TO

23:33.779 --> 23:34.412
REPLACE HIM IS RUNNING ADS LIKE

23:34.412 --> 23:39.050
THIS.

23:39.050 --> 23:39.751
HI, ARIZONA, I'M KARI LAKE,

23:39.751 --> 23:40.485
THE TRUMP-ENDORSED CANDIDATE FOR

23:40.485 --> 23:41.353
GOVERNOR.

23:41.353 --> 23:42.487
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS AD RIGHT

23:42.487 --> 23:43.288
NOW, IT MEANS YOU'RE IN THE

23:43.288 --> 23:44.422
MIDDLE OF WATCHING A FAKE NEWS

23:44.422 --> 23:45.557
PROGRAM.

23:45.557 --> 23:46.892
YOU KNOW HOW TO KNOW IT'S FAKE?

23:46.892 --> 23:48.193
BECAUSE THEY WON'T EVEN COVER

23:48.193 --> 23:50.162
THE BIGGEST STORY OUT THERE, THE

23:50.162 --> 23:52.264
RIGGED ELECTION OF 2020.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.698
OKAY, EXCEPT EVERY BIT

23:53.698 --> 23:55.000
OF THAT IS WRONG.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.068
THE ELECTION WASN'T RIGGED, AND

23:57.068 --> 23:58.170
THE NEWS DID COVER BOTH THE

23:58.170 --> 24:00.172
RECOUNTS AND THE LAWSUITS.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.573
PLUS, IF YOU JUST SAW THAT AD

24:01.573 --> 24:06.678
FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS SHOW,

24:06.678 --> 24:07.412
YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT WATCHING IT

24:07.412 --> 24:08.313
ON A FAKE NEWS PROGRAM, YOU'RE

24:08.313 --> 24:09.881
WATCHING IT BECAUSE YOU LEFT THE

24:09.881 --> 24:14.019
TV ON AFTER WHITE LOTUS.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.421
THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT

24:16.421 --> 24:17.055
NOW!

24:17.055 --> 24:17.756
AND THAT AD-- WHICH INCLUDES

24:17.756 --> 24:18.824
FOOTAGE FROM "2000 MULES BY THE

24:18.824 --> 24:19.791
WAY-- IS ACTUALLY TAME COMPARED

24:19.791 --> 24:20.425
TO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS

24:20.425 --> 24:21.459
LAKE'S SAID.

24:21.459 --> 24:22.694
BECAUSE SHE'S CALLED FOR THE

24:22.694 --> 24:23.662
IMPRISONMENT OF THE CURRENT

24:23.662 --> 24:24.362
SECRETARY OF STATE, AND SAID

24:24.362 --> 24:25.063
THAT, IF SHE DIDN'T WIN HER

24:25.063 --> 24:25.597
PRIMARY, IT'D BE BECAUSE

24:25.597 --> 24:26.498
"THERE'S SOME CHEATING GOING

24:26.498 --> 24:30.135
ON."

24:30.135 --> 24:34.439
AND THEN AFTER WINNING IT IT'S

24:34.439 --> 24:35.040
BECAUSE HER SUPPORTERS SIMPLY

24:35.040 --> 24:35.507
"OUT-VOTED THE FRAUD."

24:35.507 --> 24:36.308
WHICH IS BASICALLY, "IF I LOSE

24:36.308 --> 24:36.842
IT'S RIGGED, IF I WIN IT'S

24:36.842 --> 24:37.542
FINE."

24:37.542 --> 24:38.743
MEANING SHE'S APPROACHING

24:38.743 --> 24:39.811
ELECTIONS WITH THE SAME

24:39.811 --> 24:40.545
OBJECTIVITY AND NUANCE OF A

24:40.545 --> 24:41.146
FIVE-YEAR-OLD INVENTING A GAME

24:41.146 --> 24:42.547
IN REAL TIME.

24:42.547 --> 24:44.082
"THE RULES ARE SIMPLE; WHOEVER

24:44.082 --> 24:45.884
HAS THE MOST TOKENS WINS, UNLESS

24:45.884 --> 24:47.219
YOU HAVE THE MOST TOKENS, THEN

24:47.219 --> 24:48.820
IT'S WHO CAN HOLD THEIR BREATH

24:48.820 --> 24:49.788
THE LONGEST, UNLESS YOU CAN,

24:49.788 --> 24:53.058
THEN IT'S A JUMPING CONTEST."

24:53.058 --> 24:54.659
BUT IT GETS WORSE FOR ARIZONA,

24:54.659 --> 24:55.961
BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE

24:55.961 --> 24:57.329
FOR SECRETARY OF STATE IS MARK

24:57.329 --> 24:59.030
FINCHEM-- WHO, AS YOU CAN SEE,

24:59.030 --> 25:00.065
WAKES UP EVERY DAY TO COSPLAY AS

25:00.065 --> 25:02.000
A COWBOY ACCOUNTANT.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.003
AND HE SEEMS PRETTY UNLIKELY TO

25:05.003 --> 25:06.104
WILLINGLY CERTIFY A DEMOCRATIC

25:06.104 --> 25:06.671
WIN IN HIS STATE, GIVEN THAT

25:06.671 --> 25:10.175
HE'S SAID THIS.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.977
WOULD YOU EVER ACCEPT THAT A

25:11.977 --> 25:13.879
DEMOCRAT COULD WIN ARIZONA, OR

25:13.879 --> 25:14.512
WOULD YOU JUST NOT THINK THAT'S

25:14.512 --> 25:15.814
POSSIBLE?

25:15.814 --> 25:17.148
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING

25:17.148 --> 25:21.820
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.623
EVERYWHERE I GO, THE VAST

25:24.623 --> 25:25.857
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE STILL SHOW

25:25.857 --> 25:29.094
SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.262
BUT THAT MIGHT JUST BE

25:30.262 --> 25:32.397
BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO PLACES

25:32.397 --> 25:33.398
WHERE THERE ARE SUPPORTERS OF

25:33.398 --> 25:35.600
DONALD TRUMP.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.568
IS THERE ANY CHANCE A DEMOCRATIC

25:36.568 --> 25:37.702
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT CAN WIN

25:37.702 --> 25:43.608
ARIZONA IN 2024?

25:43.608 --> 25:47.212
NO, NO, NO.

25:47.212 --> 25:47.846
I GENUINELY DON'T KNOW

25:47.846 --> 25:48.480
WHAT'S MORE ANNOYING THERE, THE

25:48.480 --> 25:48.980
FACT THAT HE ANSWERED A

25:48.980 --> 25:49.848
LEGITIMATE QUESTION WITH A PROP,

25:49.848 --> 25:53.852
OR THAT HE APPARENTLY TELLS

25:53.852 --> 25:54.753
PEOPLE NO SO OFTEN HE NEEDED A

25:54.753 --> 25:55.820
SPECIAL BUTTON FOR IT.

25:55.820 --> 25:56.588
ALTHOUGH BETWEEN THAT, HIS

25:56.588 --> 25:57.822
TALKING TRUMP DOLL AND HIS

25:57.822 --> 25:59.424
NOVELTY DESK SIGN, IT'S SLIGHTLY

25:59.424 --> 26:00.825
HEARTWARMING TO KNOW THAT A

26:00.825 --> 26:02.294
SPENCER'S GIFTS IN ARIZONA IS

26:02.294 --> 26:03.828
STAYING AFLOAT THANKS TO THE

26:03.828 --> 26:05.330
COMPULSIVE PURCHASES OF ONE

26:05.330 --> 26:09.134
SUPREMELY WEIRD INDIVIDUAL.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.269
BUT THE THING IS, QUIET EARP

26:11.269 --> 26:12.604
OVER THERE HAS OPENLY TOLD

26:12.604 --> 26:13.972
SUPPORTERS IN A FUNDRAISING

26:13.972 --> 26:15.307
EMAIL THAT, IF HE HAD BEEN IN

26:15.307 --> 26:17.008
POWER IN 2020, "WE WOULD HAVE

26:17.008 --> 26:22.180
WON.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.348
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.'"

26:23.348 --> 26:24.649
AND IN A DEBATE, EVEN

26:24.649 --> 26:25.717
BRAINSTORMED ONE SCENARIO OF HOW

26:25.717 --> 26:26.751
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.353
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW TODAY,

26:28.353 --> 26:30.021
THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT

26:30.021 --> 26:31.856
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE AS

26:31.856 --> 26:32.791
IRREDEEMABLY COMPROMISED.

26:32.791 --> 26:33.692
MARICOPA COUNTY WAS ONE OF THEM.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.460
YUMA COUNTY WAS ONE OF THEM.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.362
WE HAVE SO MANY VOTES OUTSIDE OF

26:37.362 --> 26:37.696
THE LAW.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.331
THAT IT BEGS THE QUESTION, WHAT

26:39.331 --> 26:42.033
DO WE DO WITH AN ELECTION WHERE

26:42.033 --> 26:44.402
WE HAVE VOTES THAT ARE IN THE

26:44.402 --> 26:47.906
STREAM BUT SHOULD NOT BE

26:47.906 --> 26:48.740
COUNTED?

26:48.740 --> 26:49.874
IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE INDIVIDUAL

26:49.874 --> 26:52.978
WHO IS ENGAGED IN THAT BEHAVIOR,

26:52.978 --> 26:55.113
PERHAPS THAT COUNTY HAS HAD A

26:55.113 --> 26:57.682
DEFECTIVE ELECTION.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.918
YEAH-- HE JUST LAID

26:59.918 --> 27:01.319
HIS PLAN OUT.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.488
IDENTIFY TWO LARGE

27:03.488 --> 27:05.023
COUNTIES WHICH, IF REMOVED FROM

27:05.023 --> 27:05.724
THE COUNT, WOULD HAND THE

27:05.724 --> 27:07.225
ELECTION TO TRUMP.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.526
REMOVE THEM FROM THE

27:08.526 --> 27:10.528
COUNT.

27:10.528 --> 27:11.963
NOW, IS THAT A CONSPIRACY TO

27:11.963 --> 27:13.565
STEAL THE ELECTION?

27:13.565 --> 27:15.300
WELL, AS WE NOW KNOW, THERE ARE

27:15.300 --> 27:18.003
NO CONSPIRACIES, BUT THERE ARE

27:18.003 --> 27:19.804
ALSO NO COINCIDENCES, IN THE

27:19.804 --> 27:20.372
FAMOUS WORDS OF ONE STEPHEN

27:20.372 --> 27:22.874
KEVIN BANNON.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.642
AND HERE'S THE THING: ANY ONE OF

27:24.642 --> 27:25.910
THE PEOPLE YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR

27:25.910 --> 27:27.612
WOULD BE BAD IN THE WAKE OF AN

27:27.612 --> 27:29.347
ELECTION, BUT IN COMBINATION,

27:29.347 --> 27:31.483
THINGS COULD GET "ROUGH."

27:31.483 --> 27:32.784
BECAUSE THERE "ARE PROTECTIONS

27:32.784 --> 27:33.852
AGAINST ONE ROGUE OFFICIAL

27:33.852 --> 27:34.886
REFUSING TO SIGN OFF ON AN

27:34.886 --> 27:35.987
ELECTION.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.022
THEY COULD BE SUED, AND IF THEY

27:37.022 --> 27:38.289
REFUSE, THEY COULD BE HELD IN

27:38.289 --> 27:40.892
CONTEMPT OF COURT.

27:40.892 --> 27:42.060
BUT EXPERTS WARN THAT THE

27:42.060 --> 27:43.328
ABILITY OF A GOVERNOR OR

27:43.328 --> 27:45.163
SECRETARY OF STATE TO REJECT

27:45.163 --> 27:47.899
CERTIFICATION ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

27:47.899 --> 27:49.501
ENHANCED IF OTHERS UP AND DOWN

27:49.501 --> 27:51.536
THE CHAIN ARE OF A SIMILAR MIND.

27:51.536 --> 27:54.906
AND TO UNDERSTAND A POTENTIAL

27:54.906 --> 27:55.573
WORST-CASE SCENARIO, LET'S PUT

27:55.573 --> 27:56.207
SOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU'VE SEEN

27:56.207 --> 27:58.209
TONIGHT INTO A CHAIN.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.545
LET'S START WITH PARTISAN POLL

28:00.545 --> 28:01.846
WORKERS, INSPIRED BY STEVE

28:01.846 --> 28:02.447
BANNON, DECIDING THEY'VE SEEN

28:02.447 --> 28:03.715
SOMETHING FISHY, AND CALLING

28:03.715 --> 28:04.916
9-1-1.

28:04.916 --> 28:07.485
THEY THEN KICK THEIR CLAIMS UP

28:07.485 --> 28:08.520
TO A COUNTY CLERK LIKE THIS GUY

28:08.520 --> 28:09.421
WHO'S MAYBE WILLING TO

28:09.421 --> 28:12.090
AMPLIFY A PERCEPTION THAT'S NOT

28:12.090 --> 28:13.091
A REALITY.

28:13.091 --> 28:14.392
THAT RAISES ENOUGH OF A STINK

28:14.392 --> 28:16.161
THAT PEOPLE AT THE COUNTY BOARD

28:16.161 --> 28:18.596
OF CANVASSERS OR THE STATE BOARD

28:18.596 --> 28:20.732
REFUSE TO SIGN OFF ON THE

28:20.732 --> 28:20.965
RESULTS.

28:20.965 --> 28:21.900
AND THEN, THE SECRETARY OF STATE

28:21.900 --> 28:24.202
TAKES THEIR SIDE-- REFUSING TO

28:24.202 --> 28:24.869
CERTIFY THE RESULTS, OR EVEN

28:24.869 --> 28:26.938
ARGUING THAT THE RESULTS FROM

28:26.938 --> 28:28.973
CERTAIN COUNTIES ARE SO FLAWED

28:28.973 --> 28:29.574
THAT THE COUNTY'S ELECTION HAS

28:29.574 --> 28:30.408
"FAILED", AND THEREFORE CAN NOT

28:30.408 --> 28:31.709
BE COUNTED.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.645
IN THAT SCENARIO, EXPERTS SAY, A

28:33.645 --> 28:35.246
REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURE

28:35.246 --> 28:37.382
COULD POINT TO SUPPOSED

28:37.382 --> 28:38.450
"IRREGULARITIES IN THE CONDUCT

28:38.450 --> 28:39.951
OF THE ELECTION, AND CHOOSE

28:39.951 --> 28:40.819
THEIR OWN SLATE OF ELECTORS, TO

28:40.819 --> 28:43.922
DELIVER A DIFFERENT RESULT.

28:43.922 --> 28:44.756
AND AT THIS POINT, THE LAW IS A

28:44.756 --> 28:45.590
LITTLE FUZZY ON WHAT COULD

28:45.590 --> 28:47.425
HAPPEN NEXT.

28:47.425 --> 28:48.560
BECAUSE, UNDER THE ELECTORAL

28:48.560 --> 28:50.595
COUNT ACT OF 1887, IF THE STATE

28:50.595 --> 28:52.263
SENDS TWO RIVAL SLATES OF

28:52.263 --> 28:53.364
ELECTORS AND THE HOUSE AND

28:53.364 --> 28:55.567
SENATE DISAGREE ON WHICH ONE IS

28:55.567 --> 28:57.335
VALID, THE ONES SENT BY THE

28:57.335 --> 29:02.907
STATE'S GOVERNOR GETS COUNTED.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.043
WHICH COULD BE THIS PERSON.

29:05.043 --> 29:05.677
NOW, THERE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE

29:05.677 --> 29:06.611
LAWSUITS, AND MAYBE THE SUPREME

29:06.611 --> 29:07.278
COURT WOULD STEP IN, BUT ALSO

29:07.278 --> 29:08.379
Y'KNOW, SEEING AS ONE OF THE

29:08.379 --> 29:09.881
JUSTICES HAS A WIFE WHO WAS PART

29:09.881 --> 29:11.349
OF THE LAST ATTEMPTED COUP,

29:11.349 --> 29:12.984
MAYBE NOT.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.119
AND I KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS

29:14.119 --> 29:15.954
DRAMATIC, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

29:15.954 --> 29:17.155
TOO ALARMIST.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.389
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND LIKE

29:18.389 --> 29:24.462
CHICKEN LITTLE HERE.

29:24.462 --> 29:25.130
I MEAN, I DON'T MEAN TO LOOK

29:25.130 --> 29:25.897
LIKE HIM EITHER, BUT SOME THINGS

29:25.897 --> 29:27.499
ARE OUT OF OUR HANDS.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.967
BECAUSE THE ODDS OF KARI LAKE

29:28.967 --> 29:30.568
UNILATERALLY PICKING OUR NEXT

29:30.568 --> 29:32.971
PRESIDENT ARE THANKFULLY SLIM.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.873
BUT THE ODDS OF HER, AND OTHERS

29:34.873 --> 29:36.808
LIKE HER, BEING ABLE TO CREATE A

29:36.808 --> 29:37.575
COMPLETE MESS, ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

29:37.575 --> 29:39.777
HIGHER.

29:39.777 --> 29:40.745
BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED

29:40.745 --> 29:41.880
ABOUT TONIGHT HAS THE CAPACITY

29:41.880 --> 29:42.981
TO OVERWHELM OUR SYSTEM, MAKING

29:42.981 --> 29:47.051
IT HARDER TO CERTIFY ELECTIONS

29:47.051 --> 29:48.086
QUICKLY, LEADING TO CONFUSION,

29:48.086 --> 29:48.753
WHICH SOWS DOUBT IN THE PROCESS,

29:48.753 --> 29:49.487
WHICH IN TURN CAUSES ABSOLUTE

29:49.487 --> 29:50.622
CHAOS.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.323
WHICH IS WORRYING, GIVEN THAT

29:52.323 --> 29:54.092
WE'VE ALL SEEN WHAT CONFUSED BUT

29:54.092 --> 29:55.059
MOTIVATED PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF

29:55.059 --> 29:56.127
DOING WHEN THEY THINK THE

29:56.127 --> 29:58.229
PROCESS IS BROKEN.

29:58.229 --> 29:59.998
AND WE MAY NOT HAVE TO WAIT

29:59.998 --> 30:03.034
UNTIL 2024 TO SEE THAT CHAOS

30:03.034 --> 30:04.636
UNFOLD, AS THE MIDTERMS

30:04.636 --> 30:05.336
THEMSELVES ARE TURNING INTO A

30:05.336 --> 30:07.238
CLUSTERFUCK.

30:07.238 --> 30:08.806
VIGILANTES ARE ALREADY TURNING

30:08.806 --> 30:10.375
UP AS UNOFFICIAL POLL WATCHERS

30:10.375 --> 30:12.443
AT VOTING DROP BOXES.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.279
MEANWHILE, SOME VERY PROMINENT

30:14.279 --> 30:16.314
VOICES ON THE RIGHT HAVE BEEN

30:16.314 --> 30:18.016
PRIMING PEOPLE TO CONTEST ANY

30:18.016 --> 30:19.384
RESULT ON TUESDAY THAT'S NOT A

30:19.384 --> 30:21.152
REPUBLICAN WIN.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.621
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS SUCH

30:23.621 --> 30:25.256
CONTEMPT FOR VOTERS AND FOR

30:25.256 --> 30:27.058
DEMOCRACY ITSELF AND SO MUCH

30:27.058 --> 30:29.060
CONFIDENCE IN ITS OWNERSHIP OF

30:29.060 --> 30:30.061
THE MEDIA AND OF BIG TECH THAT

30:30.061 --> 30:38.570
IT NO LONGER HAS TO TRY TO WIN

30:38.570 --> 30:39.070
YOUR VOTES.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.038
THEY CAN EVEN RUN MENTALLY

30:40.038 --> 30:40.672
DEFECTIVE CANDIDATES WHO CAN

30:40.672 --> 30:41.673
BARELY SPEAK AND NOT ONLY EXPECT

30:41.673 --> 30:42.407
THEM TO WIN BUT EXPECT YOU TO

30:42.407 --> 30:43.708
ACCEPT THE OUTCOME, NO MATTER

30:43.708 --> 30:47.979
HOW TRANSPARENTLY ABSURD IT IS.

30:47.979 --> 30:49.180
I GET THAT

30:49.180 --> 30:50.315
TUCKER CARLSON IS BASICALLY

30:50.315 --> 30:51.916
COCOMELON FOR BIGOTS, BUT THAT'S

30:51.916 --> 30:54.252
GROSS EVEN FOR HIM.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.955
FROM CALLING A STROKE VICTIM

30:56.955 --> 31:01.092
MENTALLY DEFECTIVE, TO PUTTING

31:01.092 --> 31:01.759
"WIN" IN HEAVY QUOTATION MARKS

31:01.759 --> 31:02.794
AND FOR THE RECORD, ONE OF

31:02.794 --> 31:03.361
THE BIG CLUES THAT THESE

31:03.361 --> 31:04.362
CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE BULLSHIT

31:04.362 --> 31:05.496
IS THAT SO MANY OF THEM ARE

31:05.496 --> 31:06.164
PREDICATED ON THE BELIEF THAT

31:06.164 --> 31:07.131
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS

31:07.131 --> 31:08.266
WELL-ORGANIZED.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.936
WHO ON EARTH IS STUPID ENOUGH TO

31:11.936 --> 31:14.772
BUY THAT BULLSHIT?

31:14.772 --> 31:15.506
WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?

31:15.506 --> 31:16.307
WELL, THERE ARE SOME OBVIOUS

31:16.307 --> 31:16.874
STEPS THAT WE COULD TAKE.

31:16.874 --> 31:17.742
ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL, WE HAVE TO

31:17.742 --> 31:18.843
FIX THE ELECTORAL COUNT ACT--

31:18.843 --> 31:19.944
THE LAW WHOSE VAGUENESS ALLOWS

31:19.944 --> 31:22.113
FOR A LOT OF THE FUCKERY I'VE

31:22.113 --> 31:23.248
JUST DESCRIBED.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.516
BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE

31:25.516 --> 31:26.517
ACTUALLY HAVE BILLS THAT HAVE

31:26.517 --> 31:27.151
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WOULD,

31:27.151 --> 31:29.487
AMONG OTHER THINGS, CLOSE THE

31:29.487 --> 31:32.991
FAILED ELECTION LOOPHOLE THAT

31:32.991 --> 31:34.225
MIGHT ALLOW A PARTISAN GOVERNOR

31:34.225 --> 31:35.460
OR STATE LEGISLATURE TO SEND

31:35.460 --> 31:36.160
WHATEVER ELECTORS THEY CHOOSE.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.862
MITCH McCONNELL'S SUPPORTED

31:37.862 --> 31:39.764
THE SENATE VERSION, SO IT

31:39.764 --> 31:40.431
ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO

31:40.431 --> 31:41.266
PASS.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.066
THAT'S THE ONE PIECE OF GOOD

31:42.066 --> 31:43.201
NEWS IN THIS ENTIRE PIECE, SO I

31:43.201 --> 31:45.003
SUGGEST YOU SAVOR IT.

31:45.003 --> 31:46.337
BUT THAT'S CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH.

31:46.337 --> 31:47.205
LONG TERM, WE STILL NEED

31:47.205 --> 31:48.139
COMPREHENSIVE VOTING RIGHTS

31:48.139 --> 31:49.407
REFORM.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.642
WHICH IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO

31:50.642 --> 31:52.010
PRIORITIZE AND FIGHT FOR.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.911
BUT THE FIRST STEP, AND I KNOW

31:53.911 --> 31:55.980
THIS IS GOING TO BE INFURIATING

31:55.980 --> 31:58.549
TO HEAR, IS FOR YOU TO VOTE.

31:58.549 --> 32:01.586
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW

32:01.586 --> 32:02.120
PART OF THE REASON BIDEN'S

32:02.120 --> 32:02.720
VICTORY WASN'T STOLEN FROM HIM

32:02.720 --> 32:03.888
WAS THANKS TO THE DILIGENT WORK

32:03.888 --> 32:04.555
OF A FEW PEOPLE IN KEY

32:04.555 --> 32:09.260
POSITIONS.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.028
BUT DON'T FORGET THE FIRST PART

32:10.028 --> 32:10.895
OF WHY THAT WAS POSSIBLE-- A

32:10.895 --> 32:12.530
LOT OF PEOPLE FUCKING VOTED.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.365
AND I GET HOW LUDICROUS IT

32:14.365 --> 32:16.501
SOUNDS FOR SOMEONE TO SAY "FIX

32:16.501 --> 32:17.568
THE SIGNIFICANT ROADBLOCKS

32:17.568 --> 32:19.003
KEEPING YOUR VOTE FROM COUNTING,

32:19.003 --> 32:22.674
BY VOTING."

32:22.674 --> 32:25.677
I HEAR IT, I PROMISE I DO.

32:25.677 --> 32:26.844
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE A MEMBER

32:26.844 --> 32:27.545
OF ONE OF THE MANY COMMUNITIES

32:27.545 --> 32:28.379
LIKE BLACK VOTERS, THE

32:28.379 --> 32:28.846
DISABLED, THE FORMERLY

32:28.846 --> 32:29.580
INCARCERATED, AND LOW-INCOME

32:29.580 --> 32:30.415
COMMUNITIES-- WHO'VE LONG BEEN

32:30.415 --> 32:31.582
SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THIS

32:31.582 --> 32:32.884
SHIT.

32:32.884 --> 32:33.851
AND VOTING'S NOT GOING TO BE

32:33.851 --> 32:35.086
ENOUGH ON ITS OWN.

32:35.086 --> 32:36.688
AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE PROCESS,

32:36.688 --> 32:37.689
WE NEED PEOPLE TO SHOW THE SAME

32:37.689 --> 32:39.857
LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM FOR

32:39.857 --> 32:40.858
PRESERVING OUR DEMOCRACY THAT

32:40.858 --> 32:41.826
OTHERS ARE DEMONSTRATING FOR

32:41.826 --> 32:43.361
DISMANTLING IT.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.996
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GOING TO

32:44.996 --> 32:47.165
BE EASY TO MATCH THE ENERGY OF

32:47.165 --> 32:48.499
PEOPLE FUELED BY BULLSHIT

32:48.499 --> 32:49.967
DOCUMENTARIES, FLAT-OUT LIES,

32:49.967 --> 32:51.235
AND THE OCCASIONAL EXPLODING

32:51.235 --> 32:53.237
TRASHCAN.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.505
BUT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

32:54.505 --> 32:56.140
TRY.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.175
AND TO THAT END, WE HAVE A

32:57.175 --> 32:57.809
MESSAGE THAT WE'D LIKE YOU TO

32:57.809 --> 33:00.945
HEAR.

33:03.448 --> 33:07.151
HEY, NICK OFFERMAN HERE.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.354
ACTOR, AUTHOR, WOODWORKER, AND A

33:09.354 --> 33:10.321
MAN WHO CAN ACTUALLY PULL OFF A

33:10.321 --> 33:11.756
SHORT SLEEVE POLO SHIRT WITHOUT

33:11.756 --> 33:12.457
LOOKING LIKE MY MOMMY PICKED IT

33:12.457 --> 33:14.926
OUT FOR ME.

33:14.926 --> 33:17.061
AND THIS IS A TRASH CAN.

33:17.061 --> 33:18.996
I'VE LABELED IT TRASH CAN

33:18.996 --> 33:21.833
BECAUSE IT IS A TRASH CAN.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.101
I ACTUALLY LABELED IT TWICE SO

33:23.101 --> 33:26.304
THERE WON'T BE ANY MIXUPS BUT

33:26.304 --> 33:26.871
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S UNNECESSARY

33:26.871 --> 33:29.240
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL ADULTS WHO DO

33:29.240 --> 33:31.275
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

33:31.275 --> 33:33.578
TRASH CAN AND A GODDAMN DAMN

33:33.578 --> 33:37.382
VOTING MACHINE.

33:37.382 --> 33:38.916
REPUBLICAN EXTREMISTS HAVE BEEN

33:38.916 --> 33:39.884
RUNNING THEIR DRY MOUTHS

33:39.884 --> 33:41.219
CLAIMING ANY ELECTION IN WHICH

33:41.219 --> 33:43.254
THEY RECEIVE LESS VOTES IN THE

33:43.254 --> 33:44.088
OPPOSITION MUST BE RIGGED TO.

33:44.088 --> 33:46.557
I'VE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU.

33:46.557 --> 33:50.595
ACTUAL PATRIOTS ARE SICK AND

33:50.595 --> 33:52.230
TIRED OF SHAMELESS OPPORTUNISTIC

33:52.230 --> 33:55.099
CHARLATANS WHO INVENT DANGEROUS

33:55.099 --> 33:55.767
CONSPIRACIES, PEDDLED MENDACIOUS

33:55.767 --> 34:01.472
PROPAGANDA, AND WORSE SENSOR

34:01.472 --> 34:02.073
GOOD, GOOD DOGS.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.908
IF YOU ARE AFRAID TO SHOW A

34:03.908 --> 34:09.046
DOG'S FACE, BY GOD I'M NOT.

34:09.046 --> 34:09.247
THERE.

34:09.247 --> 34:12.250
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?

34:12.250 --> 34:14.118
YOU CAN'T STOP US FROM SHOWING

34:14.118 --> 34:15.486
DOGS JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T STOP US

34:15.486 --> 34:16.187
FROM VOTING.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.055
WE ARE GOING TO DO IT NOT

34:18.055 --> 34:19.557
BECAUSE IT'S FUN, BECAUSE IT'S

34:19.557 --> 34:21.459
NOT REALLY FUN, BUT BECAUSE IT'S

34:21.459 --> 34:24.395
THE RIGHT THING TO DO, AMERICA.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.363
AND GUESS WHAT?

34:25.363 --> 34:26.998
WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT ONE FUCK

34:26.998 --> 34:28.433
A LOT BETTER THAN YOU WHILE WE

34:28.433 --> 34:29.867
DO IT.

34:29.867 --> 34:36.240
ONE SHOT, CUTS.

34:40.411 --> 34:43.481
VOTE!

34:43.481 --> 34:45.616
THAT'S OUR SHOW, THANKS FOR

34:45.616 --> 34:47.919
WATCHING-- SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

34:47.919 --> 34:48.219
GOOD NIGHT.

34:52.089 --> 34:54.525
SWEET BOY.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.593
YOU BEAUTIFUL GUY.
