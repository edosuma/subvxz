WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:07.007
ALTHEA,
DUMPLINGS ARE COOL.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.183
COMING.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.577
DID SOMEONE
SAY DUMPLINGS?

00:12.621 --> 00:14.014
OOH...

00:14.057 --> 00:15.928
- BABA!
- MM...

00:15.972 --> 00:17.321
WAIT UNTIL WE SIT.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.149
HEY, I SKIPPED
LUNCH FOR THIS.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.369
HA HA HA! MM.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.110
MM.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.937
YOUR SECRET'S
SAFE WITH ME.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.722
OH, HA HA HA!

00:29.507 --> 00:31.466
- WATCH THE HEAT.
- YES, MAMA.

00:31.509 --> 00:34.425
HOW'S IT BEEN, HOLDING DOWN
THE FORT WITHOUT BABA?

00:34.469 --> 00:36.123
I'M STILL
GETTING USED TO IT,

00:36.166 --> 00:38.995
BUT WORKING WITH FRANK,
YOUR BABA SEEMS HAPPY.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.562
HMM.

00:40.605 --> 00:44.522
HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT MIA?

00:44.566 --> 00:48.222
WE'RE STILL LOOKING.
HAVE YOU TOLD PO PO?

00:48.265 --> 00:50.180
I WAS PREPARING
TO TELL YOUR PO PO

00:50.224 --> 00:53.444
SHE HAD A GRANDDAUGHTER,
BUT WHEN MIA RAN AWAY,

00:53.488 --> 00:55.533
I JUST--

00:55.577 --> 00:59.885
HEY, I WONT STOP
UNTIL I FIND HER, OK?

00:59.929 --> 01:01.844
I KNOW.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.109
CHEMISTRY, TRIAGE--
I PROVED MYSELF.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.372
NO MORE DISH DUTY
FOR RYAN.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.679
HUH. I HEARD DISH DUTY
COMES WITH PERKS.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.376
OH, GETTING
MIXED SIGNALS

01:12.420 --> 01:14.074
FROM MY PARENTS HOT
BUT ARROGANT LINE COOK

01:14.117 --> 01:15.597
IS NOT A PERK.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.728
IT'S A CURSE.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.688
HEY, GUYS,
ALMOST TIME TO EAT,

01:19.731 --> 01:24.127
BUT FIRST,
A TOAST TO OUR ALTHEA

01:24.171 --> 01:26.477
FOR HER BIG DAY TOMORROW.

01:26.521 --> 01:27.870
COME ON.

01:27.913 --> 01:30.046
CONGRATS ON
STRIKING OUT ON YOUR OWN, SIS.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.395
WELL, I WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT

01:31.439 --> 01:32.831
WITHOUT ALL YOUR
LOVE AND SUPPORT.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.398
WE ARE PROUD OF YOU.

01:34.442 --> 01:37.053
HERE'S TO THE NEXT
BIG SHEN BUSINESS. GAN BEI!

01:37.097 --> 01:39.795
GAN BEI.

01:43.973 --> 01:46.497
CONSIDER THIS PHASE ONE.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.413
WE'RE GONNA BE
KICKING THE TIRES

01:49.457 --> 01:51.589
ON SEVERAL
OF MY APP CONCEPTS.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.330
YOU'RE ALL BRILLIANT,
AND I ENCOURAGE YOU

01:53.374 --> 01:55.593
TO BE AS RIGOROUS
IN EVALUATING THESE IDEAS

01:55.637 --> 01:58.379
AS I WILL BE IN EVALUATING
YOUR PERFORMANCE.

01:58.422 --> 02:01.643
NOW...GET TO WORK.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.429
- ALTHEA...
- YES, COURT?

02:05.473 --> 02:07.301
BEFORE WE GET STARTED
ON THE BASELINE CODE

02:07.344 --> 02:08.650
FOR YOUR
GEOTRACKING APP,

02:08.693 --> 02:10.086
WHERE SHOULD WE BE
WITH MACHINE LEARNING?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.305
WE SHOULD
PROBABLY WAIT

02:11.348 --> 02:13.089
FOR A MINIMUM VIABLE
PRODUCT, RIGHT,

02:13.133 --> 02:14.525
DEVELOP
THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES

02:14.569 --> 02:15.918
AND THEN BUILD
FROM THERE?

02:15.961 --> 02:17.354
BUT IF WE DON'T
PLAN FOR IT NOW,

02:17.398 --> 02:18.486
IT'LL MEAN
DOUBLE WORK LATER.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.791
SO WHAT'S
THE TOP PRIORITY,

02:19.835 --> 02:21.184
BEING FIRST TO MARKET
AND R&D COSTS

02:21.228 --> 02:23.273
OR BEING THOROUGH
AND FUTUREPROOF?

02:23.317 --> 02:25.188
WELL, GOOD NEWS IS,

02:25.232 --> 02:27.495
YOU BOTH HAVE
VALID POINTS.

02:27.538 --> 02:30.802
THANKS, BUT WE SHOULD
PICK A PATH PRETTY FAST.

02:30.846 --> 02:33.109
THIS HAS RIPPLE EFFECTS
THROUGHOUT OUR WHOLE PROCESS.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.545
YES, YES, OF COURSE.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.547
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GET STARTED,

02:36.591 --> 02:39.246
AND I'LL
NOODLE ON IT, OK?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.556
HOW'S IT GOING?

02:45.600 --> 02:48.255
I totally
tanked my welcome speech,

02:48.298 --> 02:51.910
all those eyes
just staring at me.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.999
IT'S FINE.
IT'S DAY ONE.

02:54.043 --> 02:57.525
I NEED TO BE POSITIVE
AND INSPIRING AND PERFECT.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.658
THE FUTURE OF MY CAREER
IS RIDING ON THIS.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.704
HERE'S MY DAY-ONE
GOOD-LUCK IDEA.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.662

03:11.060 --> 03:13.149

NOTHING ON HERE
WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.418

07:04.728 --> 07:05.773
MEDICAL RECORDS, EVERYTHING.

A DATABASE

07:07.296 --> 07:08.819

07:08.863 --> 07:10.604
THERE ARE HUNDREDS
OF PROFILES ON HERE.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.127
MIA'S DAD
COULD BE ON HERE.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.824

WHO HE IS, WE MIGHT

WHERE SHE WENT.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.176
YEAH.

OH, I MESSED UP.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.100
HEY, MAN.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.667
DENNIS, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:30.711 --> 07:32.495
- I MESSED UP.
- OK. WHAT HAPPENED?

07:32.539 --> 07:33.801
- I LOST HER.
- WHO?

07:33.844 --> 07:35.803
CLEMENTINE.
SHE'S GONE.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.152
NO.

07:37.195 --> 07:40.155
WHO'S
CLEMENTINE?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.432
SO CLEMENTINE
IS JUST A CAR?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.129
NO. YES.

07:58.173 --> 08:01.742
SHE IS A CAR, BUT SHE
IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.395
THAT CAR IS
EVERYTHING TO ALTHEA.

08:03.439 --> 08:04.527
SHE KEEPS
A FRAMED PHOTO

08:04.571 --> 08:05.920
OF CLEM IN
OUR LIVING ROOM.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.269
OK. WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
BABA TOOK US

08:07.312 --> 08:08.488
TO AN ANTIQUE
CAR SHOW.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.577
ALTHEA BECAME OBSESSED.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.666
SHE TALKED ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, GROWING UP

08:12.709 --> 08:14.581
AND FINDING HER CAR
THE WAY THAT SOME GIRLS

08:14.624 --> 08:16.321
TALKED ABOUT
FINDING THEIR HUSBANDS.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.801
YES.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.021
OK. SHE WAS JUST WAITING,
AND THEN SHE SAW HER

08:20.064 --> 08:22.980
IN A USED CAR LOT,
AND SHE KNEW.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.939
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY MONEY BACK THEN,

08:24.982 --> 08:27.071
SO SHE STARTED
HAUNTING THE LOT,

08:27.115 --> 08:28.812
YOU KNOW, SPOOKING
ANY POTENTIAL BUYERS,

08:28.856 --> 08:30.814
ANYONE WHO GOT EVEN AN INCH
FROM CLEMENTINE.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.120
- THAT'S A LITTLE--
- YEAH.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.991
I KNOW,
BUT SHE WAS IN LOVE.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.689
WHEN SHE GOT
HER FIRST TECH JOB,

08:35.732 --> 08:37.691
SHE USED THE SIGNING BONUS
AS A DOWN PAYMENT.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.170
CLEM WAS FINALLY HERS.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.564
OK, SO CLEMENTINE REALLY
IS MORE THAN JUST A CAR.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.349
YES. SHE'S ALTHEA'S
GOOD-LUCK CHARM,

08:44.393 --> 08:45.699
A SYMBOL
OF HER INDEPENDENCE,

08:45.742 --> 08:48.223
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE,
NO OFFENSE.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.790
EH.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.313
OK. TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY
OF HER NEW BUSINESS.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.575
IF ALTHEA FINDS OUT
THAT CLEM IS MISSING,

08:52.619 --> 08:53.750
SHE IS GOING TO SPIRAL.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.578
OK, SO DID YOU
CALL THE COPS YET?

08:55.622 --> 08:56.840
YEAH. THEY SAID
THEY WERE UNLIKELY

08:56.884 --> 08:58.320
TO RECOVER
ANYTIME SOON.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.974
LOOK. IF ANYONE CAN
FIND HER, IT'S YOU.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.584
IF WE'RE QUICK, IT'LL BE
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.846
SHE CAN'T FIND OUT
I LOST CLEMENTINE.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.327
NO. DENNIS, NO.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.547
I WANT TO HELP,
BUT KEEPING THIS FROM HER

09:07.590 --> 09:08.591
DOESN'T SIT RIGHT
FOR ME.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.114
PLEASE, NICKY.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.507
I CAN'T BE THE GUY WHO
RUINED HER BIG DAY.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.336
I JUST CAN'T.
PLEASE?

09:15.511 --> 09:17.165
- OK.
- OK.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.080
NO PROMISES, BUT WE
CAN START WITH EVAN,

09:19.123 --> 09:20.821
AND NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

09:20.864 --> 09:22.474
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.564
YES. OK.
I PROMISE.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.913
CAR THEFT'S
BEEN ON THE RISE,

09:25.956 --> 09:27.567
ESPECIALLY IN
LOW-INCOME AREAS,

09:27.610 --> 09:29.090
AND CHINATOWN'S BEEN
HIT HARD LATELY.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.962
YESTERDAY YANG'S FLOWERS HAD
THEIR DELIVERY VAN STOLEN.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.748
THE YANGS GET MOST OF THEIR
INCOME FROM DELIVERIES.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.227
THEY MUST BE DEVASTATED.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.012
COULD ALL THESE
THEFTS BE RELATED?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.753
POSSIBLY.
THANKS, CHRIS.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.493
MAKES AND MODELS HAVE
BEEN PRETTY DIVERSE--

09:41.537 --> 09:42.625
FANCY CARS, BEATERS.

09:42.669 --> 09:43.887
THE ONLY COMMON
THREAD IS THAT

09:43.931 --> 09:44.888
THEY'VE BEEN MOSTLY
EASY TARGETS.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.237
EASY TARGETS?

09:46.281 --> 09:47.891
- YEAH--
- DOUBLE-PARKED CARS, UNLOCKED CARS,

09:47.935 --> 09:49.153
CARS WHERE PEOPLE
WERE CARELESS ENOUGH

09:49.197 --> 09:50.851
TO LEAVE THEIR KEYS
IN THE IGNITION.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.592
DENNIS, REALLY?

09:52.635 --> 09:54.289
I'D CIRCLING
FOR 15 MINUTES.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.117
WAS THE ENGINE
RUNNING?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.553
OH...

09:57.597 --> 09:59.642
WELL, THEN
IT FITS THE PATTERN.

09:59.686 --> 10:00.904
QUICK HITS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

10:00.948 --> 10:02.123
WHEN THERE'S
A LOT GOING ON,

10:02.166 --> 10:03.733
THESE ARE CRIMES
OF OPPORTUNITY.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.606
LOOK. I'M NOT REALLY
SURE HOW I CAN HELP.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.608
MAYBE WE CAN
LURE THE THIEVES.

10:08.651 --> 10:09.913
LIKE LEAVING OUT
A BAIT CAR?

10:09.957 --> 10:11.001
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.350
SFPD's DONE IT
IN THE PAST.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.569
GREAT. THEN THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.049
WE JUST NEED A CAR.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.267
YEAH. MINE'S IN THE SHOP.
WHAT ABOUT HENRY'S?

10:16.311 --> 10:17.747
LET'S TRY RYAN.

10:17.791 --> 10:21.359
HE'S BEEN ASKING TO
GET IN ON THE ACTION.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.072
DANNY,
HENRY, HEY.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.726
GUESS YOU DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE MEETING UP.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.466
ANYHOW, WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I CLOSED OUT

10:41.510 --> 10:44.121
THE FAMILY SAFE DEPOSIT BOX,
GOT YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE

10:44.165 --> 10:46.950
AND SOCIAL SECURITY CARD,
DIDN'T HAVE YOUR ADDRESS,

10:46.994 --> 10:50.301
SO IF YOU NEED THEM,
SWING BY.

11:01.878 --> 11:05.012
EVAN, A MINUTE?

11:09.233 --> 11:13.194
MS. TAN,
THIS IS MY ADA EVAN HARTLEY.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.936
ADA HARTLEY,
THIS IS MS. JULIETTE TAN.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.329
MS. TAN, WOULD YOU BRING
ADA HARTLEY UP TO SPEED?

11:18.373 --> 11:22.333
I BELIEVE MY FAMILY
IS BEING TARGETED.

11:22.377 --> 11:25.554
LAST WEEK, OUR HOME
WAS VANDALIZED.

11:25.597 --> 11:28.165
SOMEONE BROKE INTO ONE
OF OUR CHINATOWN PROPERTIES

11:28.209 --> 11:30.298
THE NIGHT OF
THE NEW YEAR'S PARADE.

11:30.341 --> 11:35.433
MY FATHER, RUSSELL TAN,
HE'S INCONSOLABLE.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.348
WE'RE OPENING
AN INVESTIGATION

11:37.392 --> 11:39.655
INTO THESE CRIMES, EVAN,
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU

11:39.699 --> 11:41.135
TO SPEARHEAD IT.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.180
WE HAVE A TEAM PULLING
TRAFFIC CAM FOOTAGE

11:43.224 --> 11:45.443
FROM AROUND THE TAN ESTATE
AT THE TIME OF THE BREAK-IN,

11:45.487 --> 11:49.317
SO HOPEFULLY, WE WILL
CATCH THE SUSPECTS ON TAPE.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.581
- EVAN?
- I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.497
THANK YOU,
ADA HARTLEY.

12:02.939 --> 12:06.987
AH, SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT SUNFLOWER SEEDS.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.163
STAKEOUT VIBES.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.686
I COULD SPIT OUT
THE SHELLS

12:10.730 --> 12:12.253
OUT THE WINDOW
LIKE A REAL COP.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.776
CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M WAITING

12:13.820 --> 12:15.822
FOR MY OWN CAR
TO GET STOLEN.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.388
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE'D GET A HIT FAST.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.042
WE WILL, I'M SURE.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.871
WHERE'S HENRY?

12:21.915 --> 12:25.832
HE'S FOLLOWING
A MIA LEAD.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.225
YOU'RE A
HORRIBLE LIAR.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.793
"YOU'RE A
HORRIBLE LIAR."

12:30.837 --> 12:33.056
OK. WE HAD
OUR FIRST FIGHT.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.579
HIS DAD CALLED,
AND I ENCOURAGED HIM

12:34.623 --> 12:36.886
TO TALK ABOUT IT, MAYBE
TRY TO RECONCILE, AND--

12:39.280 --> 12:41.586
IT'S ALTHEA.
SHE'S ASKING WHERE I AM.

12:41.630 --> 12:42.718
WHAT DO I SAY?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.893
I THINK YOU
HAVE TO RESPOND.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.112
WHAT? NO.
DON'T RESPOND.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.417
JUST SAY YOU
DIDN'T SEE IT.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.767
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
CLEM MEANS TO HER.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.029
- YEAH, EXACTLY.
- EXACTLY.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.378
AM I SERIOUSLY
GHOSTING MY WIFE?

12:50.421 --> 12:52.162
- YES.
- NO, DENNIS. RESPOND NOW.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.034
AS SOON AS YOU
START TYPING,

12:54.077 --> 12:55.731
- THAT 3-
- DOT BUBBLE APPEARS,

12:55.775 --> 12:58.212
YOU'RE COMMITTED.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.170
BRO!

13:01.824 --> 13:03.739
- LOOK, GUYS.
- OH, GOD.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.264
HEY! WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

13:08.352 --> 13:10.006
STOP!

13:17.535 --> 13:19.842
THIS IS OUR
RINGLEADER?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.849
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A STOLEN CAR--

13:26.893 --> 13:27.981
VINTAGE BEAMER, ORANGE.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.286
I SWEAR, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.766
SO, WHAT, YOU WERE
JUST GONNA STEAL

13:30.810 --> 13:31.811
MY BROTHER'S CAR
FOR NO REASON?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.116
NO. IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.291
IT'S A ONE-TIME GIG,
ALL WORD OF MOUTH--

13:34.335 --> 13:35.858
LOOK FOR
AN EASY TARGET,

13:35.902 --> 13:37.425
YOU JACK IT,
AND YOU DROP IT OFF.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.687
THE MORE EXPENSIVE
THE CAR,

13:38.730 --> 13:39.949
THE BETTER THE CASH.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.255
I DON'T KNOW
WHO THE BUYER IS.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.083
OK. WHAT ABOUT
THE DROP-OFF?

13:43.126 --> 13:44.388
ONCE I GET A CAR,

13:44.432 --> 13:47.827
I'M SUPPOSED
TO TEXT HIM THE VIN,

13:47.870 --> 13:50.046
AND THEN THEY GIVE
ME THE DROP-OFF.

13:50.090 --> 13:55.399
LOOK. I'M SORRY.
I NEEDED THE MONEY.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.533
FOR WHAT?

14:01.971 --> 14:04.713
MY DAD AND I ARE TWO
MONTHS LATE ON RENT...

14:06.367 --> 14:10.023
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.069
HEY, COME BY
THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.680
- ASK FOR ME--
- NICKY SHEN OR HENRY YAN.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.857
WE HAVE RESOURCES
THAT CAN HELP YOU.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.729
COME ON.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.691
GIVE ME
THE NUMBER.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.215
I'LL USE A FAKE VIN
AND GET THE DROP-OFF.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.738
GOOD IDEA.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.914
I'LL TEXT EVAN, GET HIM
TO RUN THE ADDRESS FOR US.

14:38.660 --> 14:39.748
HEY, MAMA.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.576
I TOLD PO PO
ABOUT MIA.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.186
HOW'D IT GO?

14:43.230 --> 14:45.014
NICKY, SHE
KNEW SOMETHING.

14:45.058 --> 14:48.539
20 YEARS AGO,
MEI-XUE CALLED PO PO,

14:48.583 --> 14:50.367
TOLD HER SHE LOVED HER,
AND HUNG UP.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.369
PO PO TRACED THE CALL
TO A HOSPITAL,

14:52.413 --> 14:55.372
A WESTVIEW GENERAL
IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.939
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
ANY INFORMATION,

14:56.983 --> 15:00.290
BUT WHEN PO PO FOUND OUT
THAT MIA WAS 20 YEARS OLD--

15:00.334 --> 15:02.292
THAT COULD BE THE HOSPITAL
WHERE MIA WAS BORN.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.511
COULD THIS BE
USEFUL?

15:03.554 --> 15:05.600
DEFINITELY.
THANK YOU, MAMA.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.952
GOT THE DROP-OFF.
WHAT?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.171
MAMA GOT A LEAD.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.737
WE MIGHT KNOW THE HOSPITAL
WHERE MIA WAS BORN,

15:12.781 --> 15:14.261
AND I NEED YOU TO--

15:14.304 --> 15:15.479
AND YOU NEED ME TO USE
MY DOCTOR CREDENTIALS

15:15.523 --> 15:17.046
TO LOOK INTO IT?

15:17.090 --> 15:18.613
PLEASE. IT MIGHT HELP US
FIGURE OUT WHO HER FATHER IS,

15:18.656 --> 15:20.484
AND MAYBE WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHERE MIA WENT.

15:20.528 --> 15:21.833
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE MOST EXCITING--

15:21.877 --> 15:24.401
HEY, IT'S OK, NICKY.
I GOT YOU.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.925
WHAT WERE
YOU DOING?

15:25.968 --> 15:28.536
OH, I JUST WIRED BRITTNEY
SOME CASH FOR RENT.

15:28.579 --> 15:33.193
THAT'S ONE WAY
TO HELP THE COMMUNITY.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.765
EVAN, WHAT'S UP?

15:40.809 --> 15:43.812
I GOT A LITTLE
VISIT TODAY--

15:45.031 --> 15:46.989
JULIETTE TAN.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.339
SHE'S CONVINCED D.A. HUGHES
TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION

15:49.383 --> 15:52.777
INTO THE BREAK-IN
AT HER HOUSE.

15:52.821 --> 15:56.346
THAT WAS YOU?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.174
YEAH.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.047
I'M OVERSEEING
THE TASK FORCE,

16:01.090 --> 16:02.787
AND THEY'RE GATHERING
TRAFFIC FOOTAGE,

16:02.831 --> 16:04.311
AND I NEED TO KNOW,
ON THE NIGHT

16:04.354 --> 16:05.877
OF YOUR LITTLE FIELD TRIP,
WHAT STREETS DID YOU TAKE?

16:05.921 --> 16:07.967
WE PARKED AT
BATTERY AND JACKSON

16:08.010 --> 16:10.056
AND THEN HEADED WEST
ON JACKSON BY FOOT.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.709
EVAN, IF WE'RE
ON THOSE TAPES--

16:11.753 --> 16:14.234
THEN I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
TO PROTECT YOU.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.802
I LOOKED INTO THAT DROP-OFF
ADDRESS YOU GAVE ME.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.283
IT'S BEING LEASED BY
A GUY NAMED LEIF WINZIG.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.981
WAIT. I KNOW
THAT NAME.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.026
THERE WAS TALK ABOUT HIM
A COUPLE YEARS AGO--

16:24.070 --> 16:26.811
LOW-LEVEL EX-CON ON THE MAKE
IN SILICON VALLEY.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.117
HE WAS TRYING TO GO LEGIT,

16:28.161 --> 16:29.727
PITCHING SOME APP
ALL OVER TOWN.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.077
HE FLAMED OUT FAST.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.166
WELL, LEIF'S BEEN
PRETTY BUSY SINCE THEN.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.516
AFTER HIS APP FAILED, HE
USED HIS CRIMINAL CONNECTIONS

16:35.559 --> 16:37.648
TO OFFER EXCLUSIVE EXPERIENCES

16:37.692 --> 16:39.824
TO WEALTHY CLIENTS--
FINDING A TIGER

16:39.868 --> 16:42.479
FOR A BACHELOR PARTY
OR A BAZOOKA

16:42.523 --> 16:44.481
FOR AN EXEC
TO FIRE OFF.

16:44.525 --> 16:45.743
LEIF WOULD
HOOK YOU UP.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.397
LET ME MAKE
A FEW CALLS.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.530
I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF.

17:06.808 --> 17:10.594
HEY, DAD.
GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.466
HENRY.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.207
COME IN, COME IN.

17:19.516 --> 17:22.345
- THIS IS, UH--
- WOW.

17:22.389 --> 17:23.955
- I--
- I--

17:23.999 --> 17:25.653
I WASN'T
EXPECTING YOU.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.046
YEAH. I WAS--

17:27.089 --> 17:28.482
HEY, DANIEL,
ARE YOU GOING TO--

17:28.525 --> 17:31.789
- OH, HI.
- HI.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.009
THIS IS MY SON.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.752
OH. NICE
TO MEET YOU.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.019
I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, DANIEL.

17:51.592 --> 17:52.723
SORRY.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.857
IF I KNEW
YOU WERE COMING--

17:55.900 --> 17:59.339
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.602
STILL PLAYING
BASEBALL?

18:01.645 --> 18:04.431
NOT SINCE
THE SIXTH GRADE.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.259
RIGHT.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.131
HOW'S GRADUATE SCHOOL?

18:09.175 --> 18:10.611
YEAH, SO I GOT
YOUR MESSAGE

18:10.654 --> 18:12.961
ABOUT THE SAFETY
DEPOSIT BOX.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.094
RIGHT. OF COURSE. UM--

18:20.229 --> 18:22.188
YEAH, YOUR
BIRTH CERTIFICATE

18:22.231 --> 18:24.277
AND SOCIAL
SECURITY CARD.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.715
THANKS, BUT
I WANT TO ASK YOU

18:27.758 --> 18:30.718
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
INSIDE THE BOX--

18:30.761 --> 18:32.894
THE RING.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.768
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH
TAI PO'S ENGAGEMENT RING?

18:38.943 --> 18:41.032
GOT IT. THANKS.
I HAVE SOMETHING.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.425
- WHO DID YOU CALL?
- MY SISTER.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.905
CHLOE'S BEEN ON
THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW,

18:43.948 --> 18:45.298
BUT SHE'S STILL
GOT FRIENDS.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.821
ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN
AT LEIF'S PARTIES,

18:46.864 --> 18:47.952
GET UPDATES
ON THE EVENTS.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.216
SHE SENT ME A LINK.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.567
YOU WANT TO REALLY
BLOW OFF SOME STEAM?

18:53.610 --> 18:57.832
3, 2, 1!

18:59.660 --> 19:01.096
- HA HA!
- THAT'S RIGHT.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.838
TODAY,
INVITATION ONLY.

19:03.881 --> 19:07.450
AND WE JUST RESTOCKED
OUR INVENTORY.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.017
SAW-WEET!

19:09.060 --> 19:10.932
WAIT. THEY'RE
BLOWING UP CLEMENTINE?

19:10.975 --> 19:12.629
THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN
STEALING CARS FOR.

19:12.673 --> 19:13.978
I'VE HEARD ABOUT
THESE EVENTS.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.632
THEY'RE POPPING UP
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.156
OK, SO WE KNOW LEIF'S
HOSTING ONE OF THESE PARTIES

19:17.199 --> 19:20.159
AS WE SPEAK,
AND CLEM'S ON THE BLOCK.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.596
OK. I HAVE TO SAVE CLEMENTINE
AND TAKE DOWN THE WHOLE RING.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.989
IF WE DON'T CUT OFF
THE HEAD OF THIS OPERATION,

19:25.033 --> 19:26.513
THEY'RE GONNA KEEP
TARGETING CHINATOWN,

19:26.556 --> 19:27.949
FAMILIES
LIKE THE YANGS.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.472
CAN YOU GET ME
THE VIN NUMBERS

19:29.516 --> 19:30.952
THAT MATCH UP WITH THE
STOLEN-VEHICLE REPORTS?

19:30.995 --> 19:31.996
I'LL MAKE SURE
SFPD's AT THE READY.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.084
WHERE'S THAT PARTY?

19:33.128 --> 19:34.303
CHLOE'S WORKING
ON THAT,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.218
TRYING TO GET US
ON THE GUEST LIST.

19:36.262 --> 19:39.569
GREAT, BUT, DENNIS, TIME'S UP.
WE GOT TO TELL ALTHEA.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.005
NO, NO, NO. NO.
NO, NOT YET,

19:41.049 --> 19:42.833
NOT UNTIL WE
SAVE CLEMENTINE.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.661
HI, GUYS.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.751
BABE!

19:48.839 --> 19:51.451
HOW'S YOUR
FIRST DAY GOING?

19:51.494 --> 19:54.323
MY FIRST DAY?
OH, THANKS FOR ASKING.

19:54.367 --> 19:58.022
HMM. WELL, IT'S ONE
OF THE BIGGEST DAYS

19:58.066 --> 19:59.546
IN MY LIFE, AND I'M
ALREADY STRUGGLING

19:59.589 --> 20:02.070
TO PROJECT CALM, CONFIDENT
GIRL-BOSS VIBES

20:02.113 --> 20:04.290
WHEN MY HUSBAND LEAVES
ON A SHORT ERRAND

20:04.333 --> 20:06.248
THAT TURNS INTO
AN ALL-DAY GHOSTING,

20:06.292 --> 20:08.032
SO BETWEEN THINKING
YOU'RE DEAD

20:08.076 --> 20:10.209
AND BEING SO DISTRACTED,
I SPENT MOST OF MY MORNING

20:10.252 --> 20:11.906
HIDING IN THE BATHROOM
FROM MY EMPLOYEES

20:11.949 --> 20:13.516
AND THEN GETTING
A SUSPICIOUSLY LARGE

20:13.560 --> 20:15.692
TRANSACTION NOTIFICATION
FROM OUR BANK ACCOUNT

20:15.736 --> 20:17.477
TO A BRITTNEYCABBAGEHEAD99,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.044
I'D SAY IT WAS MEMORABLE.

20:20.088 --> 20:25.920
NOW, WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT CLEMENTINE, HMM?

20:31.926 --> 20:33.144
I'M SORRY.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.363
I PROMISE, I DID IT
TO PROTECT YOU.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.756
BUT IT'S CLEM.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.192
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE MEANS TO ME.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.367
HOW COULD YOU THINK
THAT LYING TO ME

20:38.411 --> 20:39.368
WOULD BE
A GOOD IDEA?

20:39.412 --> 20:40.369
PEBBLES--

20:44.678 --> 20:46.854
I GOT THE ADDRESS.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.729
I GOT THE ADDRESS.
WE'RE ON THE LIST.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.035
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET SFPD READY.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.825

21:03.000 --> 21:05.394

21:09.137 --> 21:12.706

TAI PO HAD GREAT TASTE.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.316
MOM USED TO TELL
THE STORY

21:14.360 --> 21:16.797

ALL THE TIME.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.059

21:19.800 --> 21:21.280
AH, SHE NEVER
TOLD ME THAT.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.282
SHE WAS ON A DATE
WITH SOME WHITE GUY.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.761
THEY RENTED
A PADDLE BOAT,

21:24.805 --> 21:26.067
AND I WAS
THE POOR SCHMUCK

21:26.110 --> 21:27.286
PUTTING ON
THE LIFE JACKETS.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.983
I ASKED YOUR MOM
FOR HER NUMBER

21:29.026 --> 21:30.376
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM,
GOT SOCKED IN THE EYE,

21:30.419 --> 21:31.768
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT,

21:31.812 --> 21:34.118
5 OF THE BEST YEARS
OF MY LIFE.

21:35.685 --> 21:38.209

21:38.253 --> 21:41.343

21:58.055 --> 22:00.667
NICKY SHEN.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.931
SHE'S INCREDIBLE.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.803
INCREDIBLE, HUH?
THAT'S SOME BIOGRAPHY.

22:06.847 --> 22:09.589

33:32.227 --> 33:33.663
ABOUT TODAY,
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

33:33.707 --> 33:36.492
OK. THIS ISN'T ABOUT
LOSING CLEM, DENNIS.

33:36.536 --> 33:39.060
IT'S...

33:39.104 --> 33:42.020
THAT YOU FELT LIKE YOU
COULDN'T TELL ME THE TRUTH.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.196
I WAS SCARED IF I
MESSED UP BAD ENOUGH,

33:44.239 --> 33:46.676
YOU'D REALIZE.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.895
REALIZE WHAT?

33:47.938 --> 33:50.028
THAT I'M NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

33:50.071 --> 33:53.074
WHAT? HOW COULD
YOU THINK THAT,

33:53.118 --> 33:55.337
AND HOW LONG HAVE
YOU FELT THIS WAY?

33:55.381 --> 33:57.774
I DON'T KNOW.
SINCE FOREVER.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.298
HIGH SCHOOL, ALTHEA,

33:59.341 --> 34:00.777
I WAS THIS
GANGLY NERD.

34:00.821 --> 34:03.780
YOU WERE THIS GORGEOUS,
BRILLIANT, FUN,

34:03.824 --> 34:06.087
POPULAR QUEEN.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.610
YOU'D SAY HI
TO ME IN THE HALLS,

34:07.654 --> 34:09.699
AND I KNEW YOU WERE
JUST BEING NICE,

34:09.743 --> 34:13.268
BUT EVEN THEN, IT'D
MAKE MY WHOLE WEEK.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.403
I WASN'T
BEING NICE, DENNIS.

34:17.446 --> 34:20.232
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ADORABLE,

34:20.275 --> 34:24.279
YOUR GANGLY WALK
AND YOUR SCRUFFY HAIR,

34:24.323 --> 34:27.717
AND I LOVED THAT
YOU WERE A MATHLETE.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.850
EVEN BACK THEN, IF
YOU WOULD ASK ME OUT,

34:29.893 --> 34:32.244
I WOULD'VE SAID YES.

34:32.287 --> 34:35.073
I JUST WANT
TO BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

34:35.116 --> 34:38.424
OK. WELL, YOU'RE
NOT PERFECT.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.469
YES, YOU LEAVE
THE TOILET SEAT DOWN,

34:40.513 --> 34:43.516
WHICH IS GREAT,
BUT YOU PEE ON IT,

34:43.559 --> 34:45.518
AND THE D&D THING,
IT'S CUTE,

34:45.561 --> 34:48.086
BUT, LIKE,
EVERY SATURDAY?

34:48.129 --> 34:50.131
YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BE PERFECT,

34:50.175 --> 34:53.439
AND NEITHER WILL I.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.397
YOU DON'T NEED TO HIDE
YOUR MISTAKES FROM ME,

34:55.441 --> 34:57.834
EVEN ONE AS BIG
AS LOSING CLEM.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.141
WE'RE MARRIED.
THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.708
YES, WE'RE GONNA
MAKE MISTAKES,

35:01.751 --> 35:04.450
BUT THAT'S WHAT
MAKES US STRONGER.

35:05.277 --> 35:08.628
HUH. I JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING ABOUT WORK.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.978
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.806
HEY, SHE'S
BRILLIANT, RIGHT?

35:12.849 --> 35:14.155
YEAH.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.201
OH! OW.

35:16.244 --> 35:19.726
- OH, PEBBLES...
- OH, BAMM-BAMM...

35:19.769 --> 35:21.162
MM...

35:23.643 --> 35:26.211
OH! WHOO!

35:26.254 --> 35:28.865
OHH! OH!

35:34.784 --> 35:37.091
HUH. THAT WAS--

35:37.135 --> 35:38.614
UH! OK.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.797
I'M JUST GONNA OWN IT.

35:47.841 --> 35:51.453
WE HAD A ROCKY FIRST DAY--
HEH HEH--

35:51.497 --> 35:55.153
BUT I REALIZED SOMETHING.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.285
I'M GONNA MAKE MISTAKES,

35:57.329 --> 35:59.461
BUT WHAT I WON'T DO
IS MAKE IT ANY WORSE

35:59.505 --> 36:02.160
BY HIDING THEM FROM YOU.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.292
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.686
ACH, I'M GONNA GET
CONFUSED SOMETIMES,

36:06.729 --> 36:09.732
AND I'M GONNA SCREW UP,
AND, AS MY PARTNERS

36:09.776 --> 36:11.691
ON THIS ENDEAVOR,
YOU'RE GONNA SEE

36:11.734 --> 36:15.173
EVERY SECOND OF IT,
AND THAT'S OK.

36:16.478 --> 36:20.482
SEE, WE NEED TO FEEL FREE
TO BE OURSELVES,

36:20.526 --> 36:22.658
TO TRY NEW THINGS,
TO TAKE RISKS

36:22.702 --> 36:25.183
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
GREAT COMPANIES ARE BORN.

36:25.966 --> 36:29.187
COURTNEY, DAWN,
OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT ML,

36:29.230 --> 36:33.191
CAN YOU HELP ME AND THE TEAM
UNDERSTAND IT BETTER?

36:33.234 --> 36:35.802
UH, SURE,
SO DAWN AND I

36:35.845 --> 36:37.630
WERE DISCUSSING
THE PROS AND CONS

36:37.673 --> 36:39.588
OF MACHINE LEARNING,
CONSIDERING THE TIME

36:39.632 --> 36:41.242
AND COST OF
IMPLEMENTING IT NOW

36:41.286 --> 36:43.375
RATHER THAN LATER WITH
RESPECT TO ALTHEA'S

36:43.418 --> 36:46.291
GEOTRACKING ALGORITHM.

36:56.039 --> 36:59.347
HEY.

36:59.391 --> 37:01.393
- LISTEN. I--
- LISTEN. I--

37:01.436 --> 37:04.222
- NO, NO. YOU GO.
- NO. YOU GO. OK.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.399
I HEARD
ABOUT CLEMENTINE.

37:07.442 --> 37:10.271
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE OK.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.317
YEAH. I WOULDN'T
HAVE GONE

37:12.360 --> 37:14.101
ON A HIGH-SPEED PURSUIT
IF I'D KNOWN

37:14.144 --> 37:16.625
SHE WAS LOADED
WITH EXPLOSIVES.

37:16.669 --> 37:18.279
ALTHEA AND DENNIS
ARE GOOD?

37:18.323 --> 37:19.715
MM-HMM. YEAH.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.762
THEY WORKED THROUGH
THEIR FIRST MARITAL DISPUTE.

37:22.805 --> 37:26.766
I WAS HOPING WE COULD
WORK THROUGH OURS.

37:29.508 --> 37:32.554
LOOK.
I'M SORRY, HENRY.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.296

JUST BEING HONEST

37:35.340 --> 37:37.951

39:05.430 --> 39:07.519

JOHN LIU.

39:07.562 --> 39:08.998
COULD BE

39:09.042 --> 39:10.565
