07:32.200 --> 07:34.000
Again, I swear it,
she just‐‐she hates me.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.600
AINE: Good.
Yeah, well, sh... yeah.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.720
‐ Well, all the boys
in the office are shit‐scared

07:38.720 --> 07:42.000
'cause of this women's
networking thing
she's setting up.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
AINE: Oh, no.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
All the little city boys...

07:46.000 --> 07:48.480
They're all scared that the
ladies are gonna come along

07:48.480 --> 07:49.680
and take away all the strippers
and cocaine.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.800
‐ Yeah?
[mimics sobbing]

07:52.800 --> 07:56.840
[both mutter indistinctly]

07:56.840 --> 07:58.280
‐ Well, they should be scared,
because she's working

07:58.280 --> 07:59.560
really hard on it;
it's gonna be amazing.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.400
‐ Well, her
and Charlotte.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.960
AINE: Oh,
do you know Charlotte?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.600
‐ Yeah, I've been doing
loads of work for her.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.720
She's less intimidating
than Shona.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
‐ Well, maybe 'cause
you're not trying
to have sex with her sister?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.200
‐ Who says I was trying
to have sex

08:11.200 --> 08:14.800
with anyone's sister?

08:14.800 --> 08:16.080
‐ Miss it, miss it.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.720
Miss it...
‐ Bye‐bye.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.200
‐ I'm going for a wazz.
Get me another drink.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.000
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.120
‐ Oh, hiya.
Me again.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.200
You don't have, like,
a tampon or a pad

08:31.200 --> 08:32.640
or anything on you,
do you?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.000
‐ You asking me?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
‐ I mean, yes,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
because you're the
only person in the...

08:39.000 --> 08:40.440
Actually, do you know what?
It's fine.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.600
I'll roll up
some loo roll or something.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.600
‐ Wait a minute.
‐ Oh, do you?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.000
Oh, you legend.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.400
Whoa, that is old school.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.480
[chuckles]

08:47.480 --> 08:48.840
It's like a mini air mattress.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.800
‐ Yeah, these ones
are just cheaper.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.800
‐ Oh, yeah, of course.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.680
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.560
Oh my God.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.200
I'll be really comfortable
when I sit down.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.600
Kinda like, um,
a fanny bouncy castle.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.040
[chuckles]

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
Hey, do you think it's a sign
from Jesus

09:05.040 --> 09:07.000
not to sleep with my ex?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.520
A big bloody sign.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.000
The Lord, He does work
in mysterious ways.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.800
I mean, it's not like you
can't have sex on your period,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.000
but not if you want
to make an impression.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.480
[toilet flushes]

09:15.480 --> 09:17.360
Unless that impression
is that there's been

09:17.360 --> 09:20.600
a terrible murder
on his penis.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.600
Hmm. Yeah.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.800
Hey.
[chuckles]

09:47.800 --> 09:51.000
Um, I'm gonna head.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.600
‐ Oh, okay.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.000
Did I piss you off?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.600
‐ No, no, no, no.
It's just, um...

09:55.600 --> 09:56.960
Yeah, I've just got lots of
work

09:56.960 --> 09:59.000
to catch up on
for the morning, so...

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
‐ What, writing out the
alphabet for the foreigners?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.800
‐ [chuckles]
Now you know I only know

10:03.800 --> 10:05.840
between A and C
and then after that I'm just...

10:05.840 --> 10:08.400
freestyling it out.
[chuckles]

10:08.400 --> 10:09.840
‐ Okay.
‐ Yeah.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.880
‐ Well, can we, um,
do this again soon?

10:11.880 --> 10:15.000
I miss you.
‐ I miss you too.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.040
‐ Miss you more.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
‐ No, I miss you...

10:17.040 --> 10:18.200
[chuckles]

10:18.200 --> 10:20.200
Um, well, er,

10:20.200 --> 10:21.440
you're a gentleman and scholar.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.800
‐ Yes.
A lovely shake.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.520
‐ [chuckles]
‐ See you.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.800
‐ Bye.
‐ Bye.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.760
AINE: I'm a queen.
I'm a powerful queen.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.680
<i>SHONA: Hi, you've reached</i>
<i>Shona's voicemail.</i>

10:40.680 --> 10:42.200
<i>Leave a message.</i>
[mobile phone beeps]
AINE: Oh. Hiya, Sho.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.600
Um, Aine here. Surprise.
Ha, ha, ha.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.800
Er, yeah,
I'm just checking really...

10:47.800 --> 10:49.600
Vish hasn't proposed, has he?

10:49.600 --> 10:54.000
Um, I mean, I know,
mad, but if he has, or is,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.840
find reception
and, um, let me know.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.400
Er, though how would you
let me know if he hasn't?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.880
Er, otherwise, er,
I hope it's fun and that

11:01.880 --> 11:04.600
there are loads of,
um, pheasants and shit.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.440
And, er, I'll have
everything you don't use,

11:06.440 --> 11:08.200
so, especially like
mini body lotions

11:08.200 --> 11:10.200
or mini conditioners,
or anything like that.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.600
Um, yeah, okay, miss you.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.800
Miss you.
Love you. Bye.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.200
BRADLEY: Come on,
come on, come on.
[groans]

11:20.200 --> 11:21.840
‐ Hello.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.680
BRADLEY: Hello.
MATTY: Hey.
POPPY: Hello.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
‐ Hello.
Hi.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.320
‐ I added someone
new to the break‐up squad.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.640
AINE: Oh.
‐ Matty.
AINE: Oh, hiya.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.200
I'm Aine.
Hiya.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.400
Oh, hi, Pops.
POPPY: Hiya.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.600
‐ How you feeling, Bradley?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.200
‐ Like death.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.720
‐ Oh, well, that's,
you know, at least, er,

11:35.720 --> 11:37.600
no worse than this morning,
then.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.400
How's your day with
your big brother been, Poppy?

11:39.400 --> 11:41.000
POPPY: Fan‐fucking‐tastic.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.600
He took me to the park
to feed the ducks.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.240
Then he pushed me on the swings
till I got tired.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.800
‐ [chuckles]
Yeah.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.640
‐ Do you wanna watch
some boring football with us?

11:49.640 --> 11:52.600
AINE: No, I'm just gonna, um,
read, or chill, or something.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.320
But enjoy.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.600
MATTY: Ref.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.600
[knock at door]

12:02.600 --> 12:03.880
‐ Hey, Irish pal.
‐ Oh, hiya.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.360
‐ Come hang out with us.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.240
Bradley's eating his feelings,
so we got pizza.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.520
‐ Oh, no, you're alright.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.000
Thanks, though, lovey.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.760
I'm just, er,
just a bit grumpy.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.240
I got the old period so...

12:13.240 --> 12:14.800
‐ Girl,
you must be Justin Timberlake

12:14.800 --> 12:16.760
'cause we is N'Sync, okay.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.680
[laughs]
‐ [laughs] Really?

12:18.680 --> 12:20.720
POPPY: Yeah, I've been bleeding
all over the couch all evening.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.880
AINE: Oh, wow.
Okay...
[chuckles]

12:22.880 --> 12:24.760
BRADLEY: Aine, I've got one of,
um, Emma's hot water bottles.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.120
Come out and hang, babe.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.600
Come on. Come on.
‐ Come on, let's go.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.080
Don't make me tickle you.
‐ No.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.560
[laughs]
‐ I'll do it, you know.
Get out.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.280
‐ [groans]
It was a pretty intense

12:32.280 --> 12:34.120
five weeks really,
you know.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.600
BRADLEY: Yeah, but I'm hoping
we can make it work, you know.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.600
I'm crazy about her.
AINE: Mmm.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.880
POPPY: [imitates buzzer]

12:38.880 --> 12:40.360
No way.
She was a little witch.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.280
‐ Don't.
Honestly, yeah?

12:42.280 --> 12:45.760
‐ What?
Aine, what did you think of
Emma?

12:45.760 --> 12:47.000
‐ Um...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.440
[chatter]
POPPY: See?
[laughs]

12:48.440 --> 12:49.440
BRADLEY: Whoa.
What, you didn't like her?

12:49.440 --> 12:50.720
‐ Ah, no.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.320
No, like, she had, er,
nice legs.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.400
‐ Legs?
[Matty laughs]

12:55.400 --> 12:56.800
‐ Characteristic...
‐ Okay, okay.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.800
This is my impression of Emma.
‐ Please.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.280
‐ [imitates Emma]
Ah, Bradley,

13:00.280 --> 13:01.840
will you pay for this for me?
‐ [chuckles]

13:01.840 --> 13:03.080
POPPY: [imitates Emma]
I don't have any money,

13:03.080 --> 13:05.080
but I've got breasts.
‐ Mmm.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.400
‐ Honestly, don't, yeah?
Shut up or I'll punch you
in your dark womb.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.200
‐ I thought it was
a very nuanced performance.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.600
Five stars from me.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.200
‐ Thank you very much.
Please, do yours.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.880
‐ Oh, do my impression
of Emma?
POPPY: Mmm.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.240
AINE: Um, okay. So...

13:17.800 --> 13:19.880
[moaning]

13:19.880 --> 13:21.000
BRADLEY: My God.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.120
‐ Oh God.
[laughter]

13:25.120 --> 13:26.160
BRADLEY:
My little sister's here, man!

13:26.160 --> 13:28.200
‐ [squeals]

13:28.200 --> 13:29.560
To be fair,
it never sounded like
she was faking it, you know.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.040
‐ I can't believe
you heard us have sex.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.240
That's so embarrassing.
But, thank you.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.600
‐ It sounded a bit like
you'd heard there was free
money in her vagina

13:35.600 --> 13:37.320
and, like,
you were trying to dig it out.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.960
[laughter]
POPPY: Go, man.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.840
‐ Fine.
Proves I'm a feminist,
doesn't it?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.600
So, if you don't mind,
ladies, be quiet,

13:42.600 --> 13:44.040
the football's back on.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.200
‐ Aww.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.320
POPPY: Brother, dear,
why have you got an Afro comb

13:51.320 --> 13:53.400
when your hairline
is running away from your face?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.200
[laughter]
‐ At least I grow my own hair.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.840
And that's not mine.
‐ Oh, that's mine.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.640
POPPY: You've got an Afro comb?

13:59.640 --> 14:02.680
‐ No, I don't.
I just call it my‐‐
my lovely comb.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.400
[laughter continues]
AINE: No, what?

14:05.400 --> 14:06.600
POPPY: Aine has an Afro comb.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.440
[chatter]

14:08.440 --> 14:10.080
‐ We should do something
about these ringlets, though.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.880
‐ You know, I grew up
in a house with only women,

14:11.880 --> 14:14.840
so I actually quite like
hearing women talk
during football.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.720
‐ Aw, that's so cute.
‐ Aww.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.960
‐ Aw, that is cute,
but I don't feel that way.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.640
So, if you don't mind
shutting up, yeah?

14:21.640 --> 14:24.600
AINE: [sniggers]
'Cause the football's on,
is it?

14:24.600 --> 14:25.960
POPPY: Shh.
BRADLEY: Oh my God.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.000
Pass the ball, pass the ball.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.040
Yes, yes, yes.

Oh, Bradley,
you know you're a queen.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.560
‐ Ah.
‐ You're an absolute queen.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.560
And you deserve someone
who sees your magic.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.360
POPPY: Yes.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.240
‐ [Irish accent]
Yeah, well I, I'm so thankful
for that,

14:47.240 --> 14:48.640
'cause I am just a single girl
on the town with my four
friends.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.400
[laughter]
‐ Four?
The three of us.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.880
‐ Guys, can I be a saddo
and take a selfie?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.800
Is that sad?
‐ Yeah.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.120
‐ 'Cause my sister thinks
I don't have
any friends in London.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.400
‐ Come on.
‐ Ah, we're your friends.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.800
‐ You're my friends.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.400
Oh, I've such a big head.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.880
‐ Look like
we like each other.
‐ Okay.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.200
[poppy squeals

15:04.200 --> 15:06.320
‐ That's nice that.
‐ Is it nice?

15:06.320 --> 15:07.800
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mmm.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.240
Oh my God,
I do have such a huge head.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.200
‐ You know,
we're your brothers now.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.320
I would kill for you, Aine.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.000
‐ [chuckles]
Oh, that's nice.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
POPPY: Would
you kill for me, bro?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.960

minor fraud for you, Poppy.

That's‐‐
God, that's, that's amazing.
Yeah.

20:26.880 --> 20:32.000

20:54.200 --> 20:57.400
It's quite sad,
the‐‐you know, um...

20:58.800 --> 21:02.000

‐ [chuckles]
Yeah, it is so, so lovely.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.200
Ah, it's just such a shame,
you know, because he's, er,

21:18.200 --> 21:24.800
he's so loved, and it's just
awful to see like the, um...

21:24.800 --> 21:27.200
the‐‐the‐‐the bits that make
someone great

21:27.200 --> 21:30.800
sort of fall away, you know?

21:30.800 --> 21:31.840
You know there's that quote,

21:31.840 --> 21:33.400
"I tried to drown my sorrows

21:33.400 --> 21:35.600
but then the bastards
learned how to swim."

Nice.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.200
‐ Mmm.
It's a Frida Kahlo quote.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.640
She's my favorite author

21:40.640 --> 21:42.400
because her books
are mostly pictures.

‐ Yeah.
