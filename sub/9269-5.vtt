Who's there?

01:10.980 --> 01:13.020
MUFFLED CRIES

01:49.460 --> 01:53.130
From the grandeur of
the Mass of Thanksgiving,

01:53.140 --> 01:57.130
to the pastoral delights
of Lady Felicia's garden,

01:57.140 --> 01:59.010
I think we'd all agree

01:59.020 --> 02:03.050
that today has been a day
to raise the spirits.

02:03.060 --> 02:08.009
Awards for distinguished
service are to be cherished.

02:08.020 --> 02:12.380
I can only quote from the tribute
of Pope Pius himself.

02:13.980 --> 02:18.490
"For the devout duty,
the boys of St Bartholomew's

02:18.500 --> 02:20.930
"will always be in your debt."

02:20.940 --> 02:22.980
I saw it first!

02:27.540 --> 02:31.890
Please join me in congratulating
Father Ignatius.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.970
POLITE APPLAUSE

02:33.980 --> 02:36.930
Or should I say Monsignor?

02:36.940 --> 02:38.860
POLITE APPLAUSE

02:40.060 --> 02:42.250
I thought he'd never finish.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.700
Bishop likes to
rise to the occasion.

02:47.060 --> 02:50.050
Isn't it marvellous?
Our very own prelate.

02:50.060 --> 02:52.490
Moving service, Monsignor.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.610
Oh, "Reverend Father" will suffice.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.970
I've persuaded Father Ignatius
to stay for dinner.

02:56.980 --> 02:58.810
Won't you be needed at your mission?

02:58.820 --> 03:01.220
The country air
will be good for the boys.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.970
They're certainly...
full of high spirits!

03:04.980 --> 03:08.530
Abandoned as infants
and brought to my care.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.820
Poor mites.
Pair of tearaways! Behave!

03:12.820 --> 03:15.500
Or it's straight back...to Coventry.
HE PANTS

03:16.820 --> 03:19.580
Why don't I show you
the Japanese garden?

03:22.220 --> 03:25.780
I've got a marvellous idea
for a fundraising gala.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.570
I'm surprised
he isn't wearing a halo.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.460
Oi, oi, look out.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.810
Ah, Brown. Bishop.

03:34.820 --> 03:37.140
Glad you could join us. My Lord.

03:40.260 --> 03:43.130
Oi! Ignatius and I
were fellow seminarians.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.970
A sterling example of
what we aspire to achieve

03:46.980 --> 03:49.780
without the distractions
of amateur sleuthing.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.740
I was hoping to catch
Professor Ambrose.

03:55.540 --> 03:58.540
An update on his quest
for the Lannington Rosary.

03:59.780 --> 04:02.140
I imagine he's busy
with his research.

04:03.900 --> 04:07.860
There's no fool
like an old fool, eh?

04:16.180 --> 04:20.810
Ambrose wasn't at church on Sunday.
He has been rather remiss of late.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.340
Probably nursing
a hangover somewhere.

04:24.340 --> 04:27.170
I'll pop in later on my rounds.
Bit out of your way, isn't it?

04:27.180 --> 04:28.660
Not if you drive me.

04:30.820 --> 04:34.490
Looks like a break-in.
One of the neighbours called us.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.370
You were right to be concerned.
Where is Ambrose?

04:37.380 --> 04:41.730
I was hoping you could tell me that.
I haven't seen him all weekend.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.090
By all accounts,
a bit of a queer fish.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.450
My friend Ambrose
is endearingly eccentric.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.140
Yes. That's one way
of putting it, Father.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.940
I suppose you'd better come inside.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.980
Not you.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.340
HE LAUGHS

05:04.860 --> 05:06.930
Place appears
to have been ransacked.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.690
Although with all this mess,
it's difficult to tell.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.570
Retired academic.

05:11.580 --> 05:15.300
All his papers. How distressing.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.930
Years of research.

05:18.940 --> 05:22.050
And what exactly did
this "research" entail?

05:22.060 --> 05:25.330
Renaissance Theology.
Nothing that would interest you.

05:25.340 --> 05:27.690
Perhaps the professor
went on holiday.

05:27.700 --> 05:31.650
Without telling the milkman? Like
you said - endearingly eccentric.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.530
A thief took advantage
of an empty house...

05:34.540 --> 05:37.210
Any thief worth his salt
would have stolen that.

05:37.220 --> 05:39.900
Unless they were disturbed.
Or looking for something else.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.210
I'd rather you didn't
touch anything, please, Father.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.010
Checking for prints.

05:46.020 --> 05:49.050
Tape-lift method - something
we perfected at the Yard.

05:49.060 --> 05:51.690
Fascinating. Modern policing.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.180
Still no substitute for good
old-fashioned detective work.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.900
Chloroform.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.570
He wouldn't disappear
without telling me.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.940
Why would anyone
want to hurt Ambrose?

06:09.020 --> 06:11.500
Father, this package
just arrived for you.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.820
Ambrose's handwriting.
Postmarked two days ago.

06:18.100 --> 06:21.610
So it must have been posted
before he went missing!

06:21.620 --> 06:25.340
Wow, Mrs M, the local constabulary
can sleep sound in their beds(!)

06:30.220 --> 06:33.610
I went to a lecture
at the Newman Society.

06:33.620 --> 06:37.100
Ambrose was keen to talk
about his recent discovery.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.610
The usual sceptics were there.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.900
Lysette Penhallick
was an English noblewoman.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.690
The Lady of the Manor of Lannington.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.820
As devout as she was wealthy.

06:53.700 --> 06:57.290
Her rosary was somewhat,
well, ostentatious.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.330
It was emeralds and mother-of-pearl.

06:59.340 --> 07:02.410
An early-Renaissance
status symbol, really.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.490
It also appears in
the family coat of arms.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.930
As a lesson in true faith,

07:06.940 --> 07:09.250
the Blessed Virgin
appeared in a vision

07:09.260 --> 07:12.620
and bestowed upon the rosary
miraculous healing powers.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.130
Lysette soon discovered
she had a religious notoriety -

07:17.140 --> 07:20.330
the sick and the dying
demanded to be cured.

07:20.340 --> 07:24.730
So she sought sanctuary
in Briars Priory

07:24.740 --> 07:27.730
after she has taken holy orders.

07:27.740 --> 07:31.540
Her final days are lost in mystery.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.210
No-one even knows where she's buried.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.090
After she died,
the relic disappeared.

07:38.100 --> 07:41.650
The priory was looted during
the dissolution of the monasteries.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.490
No trace of the rosary
was ever found.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.020
And it's been missing ever since.

07:52.020 --> 07:55.180
I may be a step closer to finding it.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.650
Lysette Penhallick's prayer book.
THEY MURMUR

08:01.660 --> 08:05.450
I discovered it languishing
in the Ashmolean archives.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.460
What makes you so sure
it belonged to Lysette?

08:10.580 --> 08:13.340
She wrote her name
on the inside cover.

08:14.340 --> 08:16.530
Lysette knew the true
value of miracles.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.530
I'm convinced she hid the rosary

08:18.540 --> 08:21.290
to save it from falling
into the wrong hands.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.820
The clues to its whereabouts
are contained in this book.

08:31.660 --> 08:34.419
And there's a letter!
Addressed to me.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.770
"Dearest Father Brown..."

08:40.780 --> 08:44.210
AMBROSE: "..as my life's work is
finally reaching its conclusion,

08:44.220 --> 08:48.180
"I fear others may be
out to steal the prize."

08:49.620 --> 08:51.660
"I may be in some danger."

08:52.940 --> 08:56.370
"I therefore entrust
the Mysteries Of The Rosary to you,

08:56.380 --> 08:58.380
"and your safekeeping."

08:59.700 --> 09:02.100
"I know I can
count on you to find it."

09:03.380 --> 09:06.860
"Begin with the Hail Mary.
My prayers go with you."

09:08.180 --> 09:10.820
"Your friend, Ambrose."

09:13.580 --> 09:17.690
Whoever broke into Ambrose's house
was looking for this.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.250
This rosary he mentions.
Valuable, is it?

09:20.260 --> 09:24.010
It's reputed to have
healing powers. You don't say?

09:24.020 --> 09:26.530
Its veneration as a holy relic
makes it almost priceless.

09:26.540 --> 09:29.140
How long has it been missing?
About 500 years.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.170
Forensics are testing
the handkerchief.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.450
We'll keep you informed
of any developments.

09:34.460 --> 09:37.410
If Ambrose has been kidnapped...
That's pure conjecture.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.930
We have to take
his disappearance seriously.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.970
Believe me, Father, I'm trying to.

09:41.980 --> 09:45.170
Now, I suggest you let us
get on with it. The letter.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.260
I'm confiscating this as evidence.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.380
Still telling them
how to do their job?

09:52.980 --> 09:55.130
And what brings you here?

09:55.140 --> 09:58.180
Thank you. Misunderstanding
in the village shop.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.220
Wait for me outside.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.660
You look tired, Ignatius.

10:10.860 --> 10:15.380
A headache. The work at
St Bartholomew's can be challenging.

10:16.580 --> 10:19.610
You must think our
Cotswold concerns trivial.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.860
What news on Professor Ambrose?

10:23.380 --> 10:25.540
I ran into your parish secretary.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.370
The police are investigating.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.610
Prone to bouts of melancholy,
so I've heard.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.410
Seemed content with his research.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.420
The Lannington Rosary?

10:38.380 --> 10:40.650
Its very existence
has always been disputed.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.850
Well, if you doubt its veracity

10:42.860 --> 10:45.500
then you must doubt
the miracles attributed to it.

10:48.820 --> 10:52.340
We'll say prayers at the mission
for his safe return.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.850
Maybe for once you should
just leave this to the police.

11:13.860 --> 11:17.570
The rosary could lead us to Ambrose,
or whoever it is abducted him.

11:17.580 --> 11:19.610
That's all well and good...

11:19.620 --> 11:23.010
Some of these prayers
have been embellished with roses.

11:23.020 --> 11:25.220
"Begin with the Hail Mary", he said.

11:26.260 --> 11:29.410
If a single rose
marks the first clue...

11:29.420 --> 11:31.250
Well, that's easy.

11:31.260 --> 11:33.770
Mary Our Lady
first appeared to Lysette...

11:33.780 --> 11:35.820
At Lannington. Yes!

11:38.620 --> 11:41.900
And the Hail Mary is
inscribed on the shrine.

11:50.220 --> 11:52.410
Oh, this is the life, eh, Father?

11:52.420 --> 11:54.810
Flash motor, nice bit of scenery.

11:54.820 --> 11:57.450
Kind of Felicia
to lend you the Rolls-Royce.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.050
Well, you know, she's got
a bit of a soft spot for me.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.900
Yes, she has.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.770
Listen, this rosary's been missing
for 500 years. Must be well-hidden.

12:06.780 --> 12:09.450
When it could have
done so much good.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.010
You really think
we're going to find it?

12:12.020 --> 12:15.250
Faith is the substance
of things hoped for.

12:15.260 --> 12:16.970
HE CHUCKLES

12:16.980 --> 12:20.180
Faith? It's going to take
a bleeding miracle!

12:40.820 --> 12:43.650
The shrine is at
the end of the Rosary Walk.

12:43.660 --> 12:47.340
Well, you go and look for your clues
and I'll go look for the pub.

13:10.740 --> 13:13.180
HE GASPS FOR AIR

13:15.420 --> 13:17.730
Give me the book!

13:17.740 --> 13:21.730
This man is a priest.
Show some decorum.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.860
Oi!
FATHER BROWN COUGHS

13:31.780 --> 13:34.730
Father Brown. It's been too long.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.370
Flambeau.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.930
I wondered when you'd turn up.

13:38.940 --> 13:42.380
Be thankful I did, or your adventure
would have ended prematurely.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.170
The rosary is too good a prize
for you to resist.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.370
It seems we're not
the only people searching for it.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.420
What the...

13:53.940 --> 13:56.010
What have you done with Ambrose?

13:56.020 --> 13:58.450
The fate of your professor
is of no concern to me.

13:58.460 --> 14:02.250
The whereabouts of your relic?
Now, that's another matter.

14:02.260 --> 14:04.330
The Lannington Rosary
belongs to the church.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.380
Which is why they've
asked me to find it.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.500
You knew he wasn't dead!

14:16.460 --> 14:18.650
I had my suspicions.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.770
He's up to his eyes in this.
I can smell it.

14:20.780 --> 14:22.820
Wait here.

14:24.260 --> 14:26.900
The man is a psychopath,
in case you'd forgotten.

14:34.220 --> 14:37.970
You expect me to believe that
you are working for the Vatican?

14:37.980 --> 14:40.090
The Holy See hired me
as a mercenary.

14:40.100 --> 14:43.130
They wanted the best.
So what's in it for you?

14:43.140 --> 14:46.420
There's been talk of an amnesty,
a papal dispensation.

14:47.700 --> 14:52.370
You paid a visit to Ambrose's house.
Kidnapping is hardly my style.

14:52.380 --> 14:55.650
I was looking for the prayer book
when the police arrived.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.810
But Ambrose made contingency plans.

14:57.820 --> 14:59.970
And made you custodian
of the rosary's secrets.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.090
And you think I need your help
to solve the clues?

15:02.100 --> 15:04.690
Surely two heads are better than one?
You need my protection.

15:04.700 --> 15:08.570
Your protection? Last time I met
you, you pointed a pistol at me!

15:08.580 --> 15:11.460
Regrettable, I know.
But here I am, a changed man.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.530
The commerce of saints
and the business of miracles,

15:15.540 --> 15:17.380
it's all so archaic.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.140
"Ave Maria gratia plena."

15:24.140 --> 15:26.930
The prayer book has
brought us to the shrine.

15:26.940 --> 15:29.940
I imagine the shrine
will send us somewhere else.

15:32.020 --> 15:36.010
This prayer of Lysette's
is embellished with two roses.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.940
The second clue
must be contained within.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.940
"Sous la rose je fleurie."

15:51.420 --> 15:55.420
"My soul sings up towards heaven
as I flourish under the rose."

15:57.220 --> 15:59.820
The second clue.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.340
Champagne.

16:10.380 --> 16:15.740
The woman's name is Penhallick.
Lives at Tibberton Manor. Yes.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.530
'..left of the family estate.'

16:18.540 --> 16:21.890
Yes, I have that. 'She's the last
surviving descendant.'

16:21.900 --> 16:24.220
Mrs McCarthy, you are a brick.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.570
'Promise me you will be vigilant.'

16:27.580 --> 16:30.090
Yes, of course.
I will keep a look out, yes.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.770
'The man is a villain,
not to mention a heathen...' Yes.

16:33.780 --> 16:36.690
Yes. Well, good night, Mrs McCa...

16:36.700 --> 16:38.740
Good night! Goodbye!

16:42.260 --> 16:45.290
You Catholics are
so unfailingly virtuous.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.700
There's a prayer in there
for everything.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.930
You could not resist
stealing it, could you?

16:52.940 --> 16:56.220
You want to save your friend,
you need to learn to trust me.

16:57.580 --> 17:01.250
According to my parish secretary,
"I flourish under the rose"

17:01.260 --> 17:03.290
is the motto
of the Penhallick family,

17:03.300 --> 17:06.730
and there is a surviving
member, at Tibberton.

17:06.740 --> 17:08.970
Perhaps they can shed
some light on the mystery?

17:08.980 --> 17:11.650
Tibberton? You do realise
Tibberton's 60 miles away?

17:11.660 --> 17:13.530
We'll make an early start
in the morning.

17:13.540 --> 17:17.530
Yes, the earlier the better. There's
a warrant out for your arrest.

17:17.540 --> 17:20.260
Hmm. Back from the dead.

17:22.060 --> 17:24.089
I'd ask you to join me
for a bite to eat

17:24.099 --> 17:26.740
but I've decided
to dine in my room.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.940
Don't forget to say your prayers.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.940
Morals of an alley cat. Yes.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.540
TOILET FLUSHES

17:52.700 --> 17:54.730
HE BREAKS WIND

17:54.740 --> 17:57.570
You do realise we're consorting
with a known criminal?

17:57.580 --> 18:01.660
It's hardly consorting. It's all
right for you, I've got previous!

18:06.940 --> 18:09.620
Are you sure this is
the only room they had left?

18:13.340 --> 18:16.050
The man is a compulsive liar.

18:16.060 --> 18:19.330
All that guff about
working for the Vatican!

18:19.340 --> 18:21.340
Perhaps he has changed.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.970
FAINT CREAKING AND MOANING

18:24.980 --> 18:27.410
That's always been
your trouble, Father.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.290
You only ever see
the good in people.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.340
CREAKING AND MOANING CONTINUES

18:36.420 --> 18:39.130
I am telling you, once he gets
his hands on that rosary,

18:39.140 --> 18:41.690
you will not see Flambeau for dust.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.620
He'll be off like
the hare at Haringey.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.890
HE GROANS

19:26.900 --> 19:29.500
CHORAL MUSIC

19:50.860 --> 19:54.300
HE GASPS FOR AIR

20:04.300 --> 20:06.980
You really think
your priest will find you?

20:09.260 --> 20:12.410
Finding the rosary
is all that matters.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.980
And what if he decides
to keep it for himself?

20:16.940 --> 20:19.220
Then you must make good
on your threats.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.340
Then perhaps we should
remind him what's at stake.

20:45.060 --> 20:48.930
He's only gone and stolen the Rolls.
I warned you, didn't I?

20:48.940 --> 20:52.250
What on God's earth
am I going to tell Lady F?

20:52.260 --> 20:54.860
This was pushed through
my door this morning.

20:57.060 --> 21:00.500
"Find the Rosary or lose your
friend. You have until seven."

21:01.940 --> 21:04.980
A ransom note. It tells us
everything and nothing.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.690
HE GROANS
You all right, Sid?

21:08.700 --> 21:11.330
You look a bit queasy. I was
on and off that khazi all night.

21:11.340 --> 21:13.210
Must have been something I ate.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.210
We have to find the rosary,
before it's too late.

21:16.220 --> 21:19.940
Well, we're stuffed without a motor.
HORN TOOTS

21:25.540 --> 21:28.700
We needed petrol.
Isn't she a joy to drive?

21:31.060 --> 21:33.570
How did you get hold of my keys?

21:33.580 --> 21:35.730
On second thoughts,
don't answer that.

21:35.740 --> 21:39.090
We're wasting valuable time.
HE GROANS

21:39.100 --> 21:41.770
Clearly he's in no state to join us.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.060
You did this!

21:45.340 --> 21:47.370
He's poisoned me or something.

21:47.380 --> 21:49.490
The man is paranoid,
as well as disagreeable.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.340
Make sure Sullivan reads it.

21:52.540 --> 21:56.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I am not
about to leave you with him.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.610
Never alone, Sid.
It's the perk of the job.

22:02.620 --> 22:06.060
Maybe you should sleep it off?
You know where we're heading?

22:08.460 --> 22:10.940
And how am I supposed to get there?

22:14.500 --> 22:19.010
How does it feel to be a fugitive?
You can never run far from God.

22:19.020 --> 22:21.130
No matter how hard we try.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.370
Our treasure hunt excites you.
I'm doing it for Ambrose.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.380
And not for the thrill of the chase?

22:27.820 --> 22:30.450
Imagine the things
we could steal together.

22:30.460 --> 22:33.090
I thought you'd
turned over a new leaf.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.930
You know, for a priest,
you're sorely lacking in faith.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.010
Maybe I'm sorely tested.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.500
I thought you'd welcome another
chance to save my sorry soul.

22:46.180 --> 22:48.180
HE GROANS

22:50.500 --> 22:53.890
KNOCKING AT DOOR
Who's there?

22:53.900 --> 22:56.140
KNOCKING CONTINUES

23:01.420 --> 23:03.580
Where is he?

23:07.340 --> 23:11.380
I'd offer you tea, only I've given
the housekeeper the day off.

23:14.820 --> 23:18.730
I'm all alone in
this big, empty house.

23:18.740 --> 23:22.210
Believe me, Madame,
we are gentlemen.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.700
Mademoiselle.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.610
FATHER BROWN CLEARS HIS THROAT

23:27.620 --> 23:30.730
We wanted to ask you
about the Lannington Rosary.

23:30.740 --> 23:33.570
The mystery of its disappearance
has always intrigued me.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.250
I'm not sure I can enlighten you.

23:36.260 --> 23:39.180
It was all such
a long, long time ago.

23:40.380 --> 23:45.370
You attended the lecture at Oxford.
I remember your perfume.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.850
I have a vested interest.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.730
I'm the last of
the family line, you know.

23:50.740 --> 23:53.330
I find it hard to believe
you've never married.

23:53.340 --> 23:55.370
I've had offers, of course.

23:55.380 --> 23:57.570
Never thought
I'd end up on the shelf.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.020
You are a woman in your prime.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.770
Lysette's later years
are unaccounted for.

24:04.780 --> 24:07.730
It was rumoured she fled to France.
A sensible course of action.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.810
The Lannington Rosary
brought nothing but trouble.

24:10.820 --> 24:13.220
It was more of a curse
than a blessing.

24:15.380 --> 24:17.770
She must have been
difficult to live up to.

24:17.780 --> 24:20.690
How exactly can I help you,
Father Brown?

24:20.700 --> 24:23.410
We need to find that relic
as a matter of urgency.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.250
I had you down as pilgrims,
not bounty hunters.

24:26.260 --> 24:29.650
We believe there might be letters.
Family correspondence.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.770
Perhaps an heirloom
might provide a clue?

24:32.780 --> 24:35.060
Most of the heirlooms are long gone.

24:36.140 --> 24:39.420
Though I can't let you leave
without seeing the painting.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.780
The only proof that
the rosary ever existed.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.330
An Albrecht Kraus. I may
have to come back and steal it.

24:57.340 --> 25:00.730
A cloister garden.
A priory cloister garden?

25:00.740 --> 25:03.290
I've always found piety
rather a burden.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.450
Wouldn't you agree, Father Brown?

25:05.460 --> 25:07.860
It's a burden some choose
not to live with.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.410
Classical imagery.

25:14.420 --> 25:16.570
The lilies allude
to the subject's piety,

25:16.580 --> 25:18.730
the roses represent
the Blessed Virgin.

25:18.740 --> 25:20.660
There are three of them.

25:23.660 --> 25:27.690
It's a prayer of veneration.
"Fidelis Usque ad Mortem".

25:27.700 --> 25:30.140
"Faithful unto death".

25:32.140 --> 25:35.420
It's telling us
where Lysette is buried.

25:42.860 --> 25:45.580
Well, don't just stand there.
Go after them!

25:55.140 --> 25:59.500
According to Ambrose, Lysette took
holy orders at Briars Priory.

26:00.780 --> 26:02.850
The Bridgettine Sisters.

26:02.860 --> 26:06.570
It's less than ten miles from here.
Little more than a ruin now.

26:06.580 --> 26:09.130
You really think she took
the rosary to the grave?

26:09.140 --> 26:13.050
What better place to hide it?
The priory has been searched.

26:13.060 --> 26:15.100
Maybe they missed something.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.980
Well, one of us needs to open it.

27:10.340 --> 27:14.610
Oi! Ah! I need to
borrow your bicycle.

27:14.620 --> 27:18.410
I have to find a rosary.
It's been lost for 500 years.

27:18.420 --> 27:21.700
It's a ransom for my friend.
I'll bring your bicycle back.

27:24.220 --> 27:26.260
Oi!
COW MOOS

28:14.100 --> 28:16.140
"I flourish under the rose..."

28:31.700 --> 28:33.340
Empty.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.900
She's been playing us for fools
with these blessed riddles.

28:41.780 --> 28:43.820
There must be something else.

28:47.580 --> 28:49.860
"Oratio Humilis Accessus."

28:51.420 --> 28:53.740
The Prayer of Humble Admission.

28:55.180 --> 28:57.220
Humble, lowly...

28:58.900 --> 29:01.500
A simple way in. A door.

29:05.180 --> 29:07.220
A low door.

29:19.580 --> 29:21.980
HOLLOW THUDS

29:40.540 --> 29:44.380
"Domine fac ingrediar coram Te.

29:45.500 --> 29:48.170
"Grant, O Lord, that
I may come before thee..."

29:48.180 --> 29:49.900
Et voila.

30:10.340 --> 30:12.380
THEY STRAIN

30:41.380 --> 30:43.220
What can you see?

30:45.260 --> 30:47.300
Not much.

30:50.020 --> 30:52.140
It's an old burial chamber.

30:53.140 --> 30:55.900
It's been left undisturbed
for quite some time.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.290
The priory sisters
must have built it...

31:15.300 --> 31:17.020
What were they trying to hide?

31:37.860 --> 31:41.490
Looks like Ambrose was right.
Ambrose...

31:41.500 --> 31:42.970
has served his purpose.

31:42.980 --> 31:45.460
ALARM BELL RINGS

31:48.500 --> 31:50.890
Give me a leg up.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.050
There never was a papal
dispensation, was there?

31:53.060 --> 31:55.570
I can't climb out of here on my own.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.610
I really thought you had changed.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.410
If they catch me, it's prison.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.530
Perhaps that's
the best place for you.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.700
Do you want to save
your friend, or don't you?

32:07.020 --> 32:10.130
If I help you up,
you'll leave me in here.

32:10.140 --> 32:11.860
Why don't you go first?

32:18.060 --> 32:20.170
Spread out and search the grounds.

32:20.180 --> 32:22.010
The suspect could be armed.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.340
You stay here.
You're no use to anyone.

32:25.940 --> 32:28.060
Sod that for a game of soldiers.

32:32.260 --> 32:34.050
The rosary...
HE SIGHS

32:34.060 --> 32:35.540
Please?

32:53.540 --> 32:55.780
I think that belongs to me.

32:56.820 --> 32:59.290
Take the ransom.
Tell me where Ambrose is.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.410
The rosary is not yours
to barter with.

33:01.420 --> 33:03.690
Do you think I won't use this?

33:03.700 --> 33:05.850
Take it. Do the right thing.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.930
Father Brown?

33:07.940 --> 33:10.650
If I were you,
I'd shoot the priest. Shut up.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.380
Police! Throw down your weapon!

33:17.900 --> 33:19.700
Flambeau!

33:26.860 --> 33:28.420
Flambeau!

33:39.260 --> 33:41.370
He won't get far
with a bullet wound.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.090
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

33:43.100 --> 33:47.050
See what you've done?
Your professor is as good as dead.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.780
I had it in my hand.

33:53.220 --> 33:55.820
CLOCK BELL CHIMES

34:06.620 --> 34:08.210
Where is he?

34:08.219 --> 34:11.770
Now that'd be telling.
You know they'll lock you up?

34:11.780 --> 34:15.409
I failed him.
He said I would. Move.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.050
Who have you failed?

34:17.060 --> 34:19.330
I should arrest you for obstruction.

34:19.340 --> 34:21.929
How did you find me?
Tip-off from the local force.

34:21.940 --> 34:24.889
A priest made off with
a pensioner's bicycle.

34:24.900 --> 34:28.610
The rosary appears to have vanished,
along with your friend Flambeau.

34:28.620 --> 34:31.929
The man you're detaining
knows where Ambrose is.

34:31.940 --> 34:35.210
Well, he's refusing to give us a
statement. We're running out of time.

34:35.219 --> 34:38.010
If you'd been honest with me
from the start.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.420
I did what I thought
was best for my friend.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.330
Jacob Spender.

34:43.340 --> 34:46.010
He's got form. Petty theft, GBH...

34:46.020 --> 34:48.170
Nothing as clever as extortion.
Troubled sort.

34:48.179 --> 34:51.050
Spent his formative years
in a mission for wayward children...

34:51.060 --> 34:52.460
Which mission?

35:28.300 --> 35:31.730
I need iodine, dressings...

35:31.740 --> 35:33.660
and the sanctuary of your church.

35:36.620 --> 35:38.890
The wound isn't deep.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.810
The bullet only scratched you,

35:40.820 --> 35:43.130
but it will sting.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.890
I owe you my life.
Then give me the rosary.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.730
Perhaps I should have
used it to heal myself.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.050
You begged me for absolution.

35:51.060 --> 35:53.130
Life is too short for penance.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.330
You can live with
a guilty conscience,

35:55.340 --> 35:58.290
but do you want to die with one?

35:58.300 --> 36:01.690
One day you'll realise
I'm beyond salvation.

36:01.700 --> 36:02.940
The day I give up hope.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.650
I hope you find your friend.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.570
Wait!

36:07.580 --> 36:09.100
Please!

36:38.900 --> 36:41.220
BELL RINGS

36:44.620 --> 36:47.770
Jacob Spender was
a ward of this orphanage,

36:47.780 --> 36:51.020
saved by the church
from a life of destitution.

36:53.180 --> 36:54.610
Phenytoin.

36:54.620 --> 36:56.650
RUSTLING

36:56.660 --> 36:58.130
You again.

36:58.140 --> 37:01.210
Get off me!

37:01.220 --> 37:03.290
We were only playing hide-and-seek!

37:03.300 --> 37:04.450
HE LAUGHS

37:04.460 --> 37:05.650
Perhaps, young sir,

37:05.660 --> 37:08.770
you could tell me the whereabouts
of Father Ignatius?

37:08.780 --> 37:10.290
Who wants to know? Oi!

37:10.300 --> 37:12.690
Mind your manners.
That's a priest you're talking to.

37:12.700 --> 37:15.850
He sits in the chapel for the quiet.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.610
These his pills?

37:17.620 --> 37:19.620
Takes them for his headaches. Hmm.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.260
Jacob?

37:32.980 --> 37:34.540
Jacob's not coming back.

37:35.700 --> 37:38.770
He always disappoints me.

37:38.780 --> 37:42.210
You sent him to steal a holy relic.

37:42.220 --> 37:44.610
I took him in when no-one else would.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.220
I gave him a purpose in life.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.210
Where is Ambrose?

37:49.220 --> 37:51.900
Stubborn old fool.
If he'd given me the book...

37:55.140 --> 37:58.570
You're a minister of Christ.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.370
Have you forgotten your vows?
Do not presume to judge me.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.610
God will do that.
I was chosen to find the rosary.

38:04.620 --> 38:06.660
I am blessed. You are ill.

38:08.180 --> 38:11.770
You are delusional. The Blessed
Virgin made me a vessel.

38:11.780 --> 38:14.020
The visions were fierce
in their clarity.

38:17.180 --> 38:18.940
Epilepsy.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.140
A tumour.

38:25.140 --> 38:26.780
Here.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.580
It changes me.

38:31.620 --> 38:34.860
The police are on their way.
What good will that do? I'm dying.

38:42.620 --> 38:45.140
Do you believe the possession
of this will cure you?

38:49.620 --> 38:51.100
You found it.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.810
Haven't you heard?

38:53.820 --> 38:55.730
He's quite the detective.

38:55.740 --> 38:58.650
I should have known better
than to trust a priest.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.610
My need was always
greater than yours.

39:00.620 --> 39:04.010
Perhaps Father Brown
should be the judge of that.

39:04.020 --> 39:07.010
After all, I still have
a hostage to bargain with.

39:07.020 --> 39:09.580
Where is Ambrose?
Now, that would be telling.

39:11.340 --> 39:13.170
You were working together.

39:13.180 --> 39:16.050
I attended the lecture
as an interested party.

39:16.060 --> 39:18.090
We needed the prayer book.

39:18.100 --> 39:21.330
So you hatched a plot
to kidnap Ambrose?

39:21.340 --> 39:24.650
With the help of that idiot boy.
She had the perfect place to hide.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.130
And with your promotion
you had the perfect alibi.

39:27.140 --> 39:28.650
While we did all the dirty work.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.330
You were greedy, just like Lysette.

39:30.340 --> 39:32.570
I am the rightful heir
to the rosary.

39:32.580 --> 39:34.610
What makes you think you deserve it?

39:34.620 --> 39:37.490
I shall be the second Penhallick
with miraculous powers.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.420
Either that, or incredibly rich.

39:41.820 --> 39:43.340
This was ordained.

39:44.380 --> 39:45.820
I must continue God's work.

39:49.980 --> 39:53.490
Sancta Maria, Sancta Dei Genetrix,
Sancta Virgo virginum,

39:53.500 --> 39:56.210
make me a miracle. Make me a miracle.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.740
Show me its power.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.130
Can you see it?

40:06.140 --> 40:08.660
Can you see it?!

40:09.900 --> 40:11.490
Heal me!

40:11.500 --> 40:14.860
Heal me! It's mine!

40:20.860 --> 40:22.780
No!

40:30.260 --> 40:32.460
Ignatius?

40:38.300 --> 40:40.500
Please!

40:42.820 --> 40:45.300
Heal me.

40:53.380 --> 40:54.860
SHE SCREAMS

40:56.260 --> 40:58.930
Tell you what, it's a good job
someone's watching your back.

40:58.940 --> 41:00.500
Easy.

41:04.780 --> 41:06.370
OK, take them away.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.930
That priest has got the rosary!

41:08.940 --> 41:10.170
HE LAUGHS

41:10.180 --> 41:14.290
HE WHISTLES

41:14.300 --> 41:17.780
Still no nearer to finding Ambrose.
Well, he could be anywhere.

41:21.380 --> 41:22.700
That's her car.

41:23.900 --> 41:28.180
KNOCKING AND MUFFLED CRIES

41:36.500 --> 41:39.740
I was beginning to think
you'd never find me.

41:46.940 --> 41:48.850
Good to have you back, Brown.

41:48.860 --> 41:51.260
None the worse for
your little adventure.

41:52.620 --> 41:54.940
Any word on the rosary?

41:56.180 --> 41:57.580
A sad loss.

42:00.140 --> 42:01.220
Quite.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.090
Father Brown.

42:09.100 --> 42:13.250
Such a terrible way
for poor Ignatius to go.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.970
His passing was a shock to us all.

42:15.980 --> 42:19.250
At least I've still got you.

42:19.260 --> 42:21.140
I never trusted the man myself.

42:25.740 --> 42:30.010
"Stubbornly resistant
to improvement."

42:30.020 --> 42:31.650
12 letters...

42:31.660 --> 42:35.100
Incorrigible. Of course.

42:36.180 --> 42:41.290
You know, I think the Penhallick
woman might have been right. Mmm?

42:41.300 --> 42:44.210
The Lannington rosary, it's as much
of a curse as a blessing.

42:44.220 --> 42:46.330
Ignatius - living proof.

42:46.340 --> 42:51.210
Yes, I can see now
why Lysette hid it.

42:51.220 --> 42:53.900
Well, wherever it is,
it's best to stay hidden.

43:00.180 --> 43:02.780
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

43:12.780 --> 43:14.460
The thieving...!
