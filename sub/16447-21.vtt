All right, we're
about to go live.

00:03.188 --> 00:04.521
Everyone on
their A-game!

00:04.523 --> 00:06.456
Good energy!

00:06.458 --> 00:08.173
Hello.

00:09.978 --> 00:11.978
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:11.980 --> 00:13.980
And I'm
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:13.982 --> 00:15.849
And welcome to a
special retrospective,

00:15.851 --> 00:17.817
where we will take a
look back at the history

00:17.819 --> 00:21.454
of <i>Fun with Flags</i> on an
episode we're calling...

00:21.456 --> 00:24.174
“Fun with Flags:
Behind the Flags:

00:24.176 --> 00:27.544
A Retrospective.”

00:29.214 --> 00:30.847

Mind you, when we say
“behind the flags”"

00:53.905 --> 00:56.239
we don't literally
mean these flags.

00:56.241 --> 00:59.275
That's just where
we have dinner.

00:59.277 --> 01:01.578
Now, I'm sure many of you
are wondering

01:01.580 --> 01:03.913
how <i>Fun with Flags</i> began.

01:03.915 --> 01:06.049
So let's hear from some
people who were there

01:06.051 --> 01:07.567
at the very start.

01:07.569 --> 01:09.669
H-Howard.
Flashback sounds.

01:13.975 --> 01:15.258
Could have played
that on my harp.

01:15.260 --> 01:17.660
Just roll the clip.

01:17.662 --> 01:19.846
So tell us in your own words

01:19.848 --> 01:23.266
about that magical moment
when <i>Fun with Flags</i> was born.

01:23.268 --> 01:25.151
I honestly
don't remember.

01:26.938 --> 01:28.271
Sure you do.

01:28.273 --> 01:29.906
I was telling you both
the story

01:29.908 --> 01:31.608
about how Haiti
and Lichtenstein

01:31.610 --> 01:33.409
discovered they had
the same flag.

01:33.411 --> 01:35.945
It was at
the Summer Olympics of 1936,

01:35.947 --> 01:37.280
and two plucky nations...

01:37.282 --> 01:38.615
Oh, wait. I remember.

01:38.617 --> 01:40.500
Oh, and do you remember
what you said?

01:40.502 --> 01:43.586
Yes. “Please find
someone who cares”"

01:45.123 --> 01:48.424
And that's exactly what I did.

01:48.426 --> 01:51.761
I found a lot
of someones.

01:51.763 --> 01:54.597
Almost 200.

01:54.599 --> 01:57.767
Many of them on purpose.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.803
And now we're going to turn
it over to you, the viewers,

02:00.805 --> 02:02.438

Hey, Amy. It's Bert.

02:36.992 --> 02:38.424
Hello, Bert.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.311
What is your flag-related
comment or query?

02:41.313 --> 02:43.630
I have a girlfriend.

02:45.467 --> 02:48.268
And what does that
have to do with flags?

02:48.270 --> 02:51.955
Nothing. I just wanted everyone
to know I have a girlfriend.

02:51.957 --> 02:54.190
Bert, you're
tying up the line.

02:54.192 --> 02:56.242

Should we get lunch or
you want to eat at the zoo?

03:36.861 --> 03:38.861
“Oh, Howie, I don't need food

03:38.863 --> 03:42.382
as long as I can
look at my phone”.

03:42.384 --> 03:44.701
I don't like
when you imitate me.

03:44.703 --> 03:46.369
You want to hear my Stuart?

03:46.371 --> 03:50.039
“It's been a
while since I've gone on a date.

03:50.041 --> 03:53.927
You mind if we watch
the monkeys doing it?”

03:58.350 --> 04:01.217
I said that to you
in confidence.

04:02.721 --> 04:04.971
This is supposed to be
our family fun day.

04:04.973 --> 04:06.723
What's so important
on your phone?

04:06.725 --> 04:09.058
I'm on the day care's
Web site.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.311
Stop looking at that.
The day care's great.

04:11.313 --> 04:12.562
It's on campus.

04:12.564 --> 04:13.896
My office is
two minutes away.

04:13.898 --> 04:15.348
There's nothing
to worry about.

04:15.350 --> 04:18.451
What if she likes the people
who work there more than us?

04:18.452 --> 04:21.536
She already likes soap bubbles
more than us.

04:21.539 --> 04:23.406
When I go back to work,

04:23.408 --> 04:25.074
we're gonna leave her
with these people.

04:25.076 --> 04:26.709
We don't know anything
about them.

04:26.711 --> 04:30.496
They're highly-trained educators
with background checks.

04:30.498 --> 04:33.967
They're even required to be
current on all vaccinations.

04:35.103 --> 04:37.420
You leave her with me,
and I'm not any of those things.

04:40.925 --> 04:42.258
Where's Howard?

04:42.260 --> 04:44.427
He took the day off.

04:44.429 --> 04:46.763
Oh, let's take advantage
of his absence

04:46.765 --> 04:49.098
and tell the kinds of jokes
only physicists get.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.150
I'll go first.

04:51.152 --> 04:54.737
Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is
pulled over by a police officer.

04:54.739 --> 04:56.239
And the policeman says,

04:56.241 --> 04:58.658
“Did you know you were going
85 miles per hour?”

04:58.660 --> 05:00.243
And Heisenberg says,

05:00.245 --> 05:02.945
“Darn it, now I don't know
where I am.”

05:05.283 --> 05:07.116
- So Howard back Monday?
- Yeah.

05:08.953 --> 05:09.952
Hey, guys.

05:09.954 --> 05:11.788
Oh, hello.
Hey. Want to join us?

05:11.790 --> 05:15.041
But he's a geologist,
and I have more physics jokes.

05:15.043 --> 05:16.626
Oh, quick! Sit!

05:18.146 --> 05:21.180
So, Sheldon says
you have a new girlfriend.

05:21.182 --> 05:23.599
Yeah, which he rudely
announced on my flag show.

05:23.601 --> 05:25.268
People were so
upset about it

05:25.270 --> 05:28.471
no one else called in
the rest of the night.

05:28.473 --> 05:30.773
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

05:30.775 --> 05:32.975
I guess I just love love.

05:32.977 --> 05:35.028
Well, I'm very
happy for you.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.813
Hey, we're all having
dinner tonight.

05:36.815 --> 05:38.147
Why don't the two
of you join us?

05:38.149 --> 05:39.482
Yeah, wh-- Hold on.

05:39.484 --> 05:41.617
We don't know anything
about this woman.

05:41.619 --> 05:42.819
What do you want to know?

05:42.821 --> 05:44.570
Is she a geologist?

05:44.572 --> 05:46.823
No.
Oh, great. See you at 7:00.

05:54.499 --> 05:57.199
How about after this
we go see the exotic bird show?

05:57.201 --> 05:58.317
Not a good idea.

05:58.319 --> 06:02.455
My hair is a coveted
nesting material.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.709
Learning anything?

06:06.711 --> 06:09.211
Well, sloth babies cling
to their mothers' bodies

06:09.213 --> 06:10.713
for almost a year.

06:10.715 --> 06:12.715
I'm going back to work
after only four months,

06:12.717 --> 06:14.717
so I've learned I hate
myself, I hate sloths,

06:14.719 --> 06:17.903
and I hate you for
bringing me here.

06:17.905 --> 06:22.391
Me I get, but that sloth
is pretty cute.

06:23.578 --> 06:25.745
It's not just the sloth.

06:25.747 --> 06:28.648
Polar bears nurse their cubs
for almost eight months.

06:28.650 --> 06:31.651
The orangutan mother builds her
baby a new home every night.

06:31.653 --> 06:34.820
And what do I do? I choose
my career over my child!

06:37.692 --> 06:40.910
Told you we should
have gone to Legoland.

06:43.314 --> 06:46.349
Can't believe Bert has
a girlfriend and I don't.

06:46.351 --> 06:48.217
I thought you were
taking a break from women

06:48.219 --> 06:49.468
to focus on your career.

06:49.470 --> 06:50.886
Oh, grow up.

06:54.058 --> 06:56.425
Don't you have
any friends he can date?

06:56.427 --> 06:58.427
Hey, I already set up
Howard and Bernadette.

06:58.429 --> 07:01.847
It's your turn to ruin
some poor girl's life.

07:01.849 --> 07:03.432
Oh, hey, guys. Come in.

07:03.434 --> 07:04.667
Thanks.

07:04.669 --> 07:05.935
Everyone,

07:05.937 --> 07:07.820
this is Rebecca.
Hi.

07:07.822 --> 07:09.155
Hey.

07:09.157 --> 07:12.608
She's younger and far more
attractive than he is.

07:14.128 --> 07:17.246
They're copying you two.

07:20.284 --> 07:22.118
What are you making?

07:22.120 --> 07:23.452
Chicken.

07:23.454 --> 07:27.089
Birds mess with my hair,
I come back hard.

07:31.262 --> 07:32.762
Finally get Halley down?

07:32.764 --> 07:34.213
Yeah, eventually.

07:34.215 --> 07:36.132
She's still not happy about
taking a bottle, though.

07:36.134 --> 07:38.367
Look, if you're not
ready to go back to work,

07:38.369 --> 07:39.852
we'll figure
something out.

07:39.854 --> 07:41.103
No, I'll be fine.

07:41.105 --> 07:43.139
It might be
good for her.

07:43.141 --> 07:45.141
Howard's mother was around him
all the time,

07:45.143 --> 07:48.861
and he's a world-class
mama's boy.

07:49.981 --> 07:51.897
I mean, wh-why
would you say that?

07:51.899 --> 07:54.984
Go ahead, have a tantrum;
that'll prove me wrong.

07:57.572 --> 08:00.289
It would be nice to raise Halley
to be a little more independent

08:00.291 --> 08:01.490
than you were.

08:01.492 --> 08:03.075
I guess.

08:03.077 --> 08:05.244
It wasn't until college
that I learned

08:05.246 --> 08:08.130
you can put a thermometer
in your mouth.

08:11.703 --> 08:15.337
On that charming note,
dinner is served.

08:18.459 --> 08:20.926
So is this your first time
dating a scientist?

08:20.928 --> 08:23.312
'Cause I'm thinking of starting
a support group.

08:24.565 --> 08:26.098
Actually, I'm not new to this.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.484
I was engaged
to a Scientologist.

08:33.024 --> 08:35.775
Bert, Rebecca.

08:35.777 --> 08:38.778
I'd like to apologize for my
insensitive comment earlier.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.696
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

08:40.698 --> 08:42.164
See? It was fine.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.082
I didn't need a time-out.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.454
It wasn't a time-out.
Let's get some food.

08:48.456 --> 08:50.873
You made me sit on the stairs
and think about what I did.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.291
Get your food!

08:54.178 --> 08:57.913
So how did you two meet?

08:57.915 --> 08:59.381
Oh, it's such
a cute story.

08:59.383 --> 09:02.017
We met on
a dating Web site.

09:05.890 --> 09:07.790
Is that it?

09:07.792 --> 09:10.893
Oh, sorry. The end.

09:12.814 --> 09:14.063
That's nice.

09:14.065 --> 09:16.565
I haven't had much success
meeting people online.

09:16.567 --> 09:19.652
I didn't either, until
I revamped my profile.

09:19.654 --> 09:22.238
What'd you do,
delete your photo?

09:26.060 --> 09:28.744
Go.
Fine.

09:31.516 --> 09:33.415
And don't you slam that door.

09:33.417 --> 09:35.134
Aw, man.

09:37.004 --> 09:38.921
Did I say something wrong?

09:38.923 --> 09:40.756
No, it's always him.

09:41.976 --> 09:45.811
So, Bert, you were telling us
how you updated your profile?

09:45.813 --> 09:48.898
Right. I wasn't getting any
responses, and then I added,

09:48.900 --> 09:52.017
“Recent $625,000
MacArthur grant winner”,

09:52.019 --> 09:53.519
and five minutes later,

09:53.521 --> 09:55.905
I met my soul mate.

10:00.444 --> 10:02.945
I was wrong.
You can come back in.

10:08.178 --> 10:10.929
So, Rebecca, how did you become
a personal trainer?

10:10.931 --> 10:13.331
I came to Los Angeles
to be an actress,

10:13.333 --> 10:14.983
and things
didn't really work out.

10:14.985 --> 10:17.936
I'd say she's copying you
again, but...

10:19.740 --> 10:22.908
...I'm getting tired
of sitting in the hall.

10:22.910 --> 10:24.860
I'd love a personal trainer.

10:24.862 --> 10:27.245
I haven't seen my abs
since they opened a Shake Shack

10:27.247 --> 10:29.281
on my drive home.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.033
I could give you
some free sessions.

10:32.035 --> 10:33.535
Oh, is that offer
for everybody?

10:33.537 --> 10:34.753
Nice try.

10:34.755 --> 10:36.922
I'm not going.

10:38.926 --> 10:40.542
Where's your bathroom?

10:40.544 --> 10:43.495
Mm, just down there.

10:43.497 --> 10:45.881
She's so perfect, sometimes
I think she isn't real.

10:45.883 --> 10:49.184
And then she goes to
the bathroom, and I know she is.

10:51.054 --> 10:53.688
Aw, that's so weird.

10:53.690 --> 10:55.590
I'm sorry, Bert,

10:55.592 --> 10:58.310
but aren't you worried she's
only with you for your money?

10:58.312 --> 10:59.945
She better be.
On our first date,

10:59.947 --> 11:02.697
I bought her
an 80-inch flat-screen.

11:04.234 --> 11:05.484
Your first date?

11:05.486 --> 11:07.786
Did you even
measure her walls?

11:13.744 --> 11:14.910
You know, on
our first date,

11:14.912 --> 11:18.413
Leonard used a coupon
to buy me a pretzel.

11:18.415 --> 11:22.083
And we lived
happily ever after.

11:22.085 --> 11:24.252
The end.

11:26.557 --> 11:29.090
Well, guess
I'm ready to go.

11:29.092 --> 11:30.642
Have a great first day back.

11:30.644 --> 11:32.561
You have everything
she needs for day care?

11:32.563 --> 11:34.095
Yep, all in the bag.

11:34.097 --> 11:35.263
Good.

11:35.265 --> 11:36.598
Okay, sweetie,

11:36.600 --> 11:39.267
Mommy's gonna go to work now,
so you have fun today.

11:39.269 --> 11:41.069
I told her if day care
is anything like prison,

11:41.071 --> 11:43.839
find the biggest baby
and knock him out.

11:43.841 --> 11:46.741
Bye, cutie.

11:46.743 --> 11:48.944
I'm gonna miss you.

11:48.946 --> 11:51.780
I'm gonna be
waiting right here tonight

11:51.782 --> 11:53.615
when you get home.

11:55.452 --> 11:58.203
Stop, you're gonna
make me cry.

11:58.205 --> 12:00.789
Great, now everybody's crying.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.458
At least Halley's not.

12:03.460 --> 12:04.876
That's good.

12:04.878 --> 12:07.929
She's not gonna see us all day,
and she doesn't even care!

12:10.968 --> 12:13.134
Who's ready to laugh?

12:13.136 --> 12:14.686
Okay. So...

12:14.688 --> 12:18.223
Feynman, Einstein
and Schrodinger walk into a bar.

12:18.225 --> 12:19.774
Feynman says,

12:19.776 --> 12:21.977
“It appears
we're inside a joke.”

12:21.979 --> 12:24.696
Einstein replies,
“But only to an observer

12:24.698 --> 12:26.681
who saw us walk in
simultaneously.”

12:26.683 --> 12:28.400
To which
Schrodinger says,

12:28.402 --> 12:31.653
“If someone's looking
in the window, I'm leaving.”

12:33.824 --> 12:36.908
That's
actually funny.

12:38.712 --> 12:41.663
You should send that
to Jimmy Fallon.

12:42.833 --> 12:43.915
Hey.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.834
Oh, hello. Join us.
Hey. Yeah.

12:45.836 --> 12:48.503
Hey, sorry if last night
was awkward.

12:48.505 --> 12:49.888
Actually, it got me thinking

12:49.890 --> 12:52.340
that I shouldn't flaunt my money
to find love.

12:52.342 --> 12:54.192
I might break up with Rebecca.

12:54.194 --> 12:56.011
Wow, that's a big step.

12:56.013 --> 12:57.979
I think it shows
a lot of character.

12:57.981 --> 13:00.098
I'm gonna hold out
and see if I can find

13:00.100 --> 13:02.350
a hot young blonde
who likes me for me.

13:02.352 --> 13:04.853
That's a good one.

13:08.442 --> 13:10.692
Okay, now, Leonard,
you tell a joke.

13:14.748 --> 13:16.364
How's she doing?

13:16.366 --> 13:18.333
She's great. Look.

13:18.335 --> 13:20.669
I see a wall...

13:20.671 --> 13:22.037
floor...

13:22.039 --> 13:24.039
some Asian baby...

13:24.041 --> 13:25.707
There she is.

13:25.709 --> 13:27.926
See? Nothing to worry about.

13:27.928 --> 13:29.461
Thank you.

13:29.463 --> 13:31.096
Okay, I'm gonna try
and get some work done.

13:31.098 --> 13:33.131
Yeah, me, too. Love you.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.016
Love you, too. Bye.

13:42.109 --> 13:43.858
How is she?

13:48.148 --> 13:49.614
What are you doing here?

13:49.616 --> 13:52.200
Can't a guy hang out
at a college he doesn't go to

13:52.202 --> 13:54.452
and stare at a baby
that isn't his?

13:54.454 --> 13:57.288
I get it.

13:57.290 --> 14:00.492
I haven't even made
it to my office yet.

14:06.166 --> 14:09.634
Is it weird if we just stand
here and watch her all day?

14:09.636 --> 14:11.836
Probably.

14:14.091 --> 14:15.724
We should go.

14:15.726 --> 14:16.808
Yeah.

14:19.096 --> 14:21.596
Or we could take her
to the aquarium.

14:21.598 --> 14:23.732
I'll get her,
you grab her bag.

14:23.734 --> 14:27.402
Hang on, Halley,
we're busting you out of there!

14:29.606 --> 14:32.023
What are you looking at?

14:32.025 --> 14:34.159
Comments from our <i>Behind</i>
<i>the Flags</i> retrospective.

14:34.161 --> 14:35.860
Get this, people
are calling it

14:35.862 --> 14:39.197
“the longest one yet”"

14:40.634 --> 14:42.517
Hello? Anybody home?

14:42.519 --> 14:43.585
Is that Bert?

14:43.587 --> 14:44.652
It's Bert.

14:44.654 --> 14:47.122
I think it's Bert.

14:48.008 --> 14:49.958
Hey, what's up?

14:49.960 --> 14:51.760
I broke up with Rebecca.

14:51.762 --> 14:53.094
- Oh.
- Oh.

14:53.096 --> 14:54.679
You know, good for you.

14:54.681 --> 14:56.881
No, I miss her.

14:56.883 --> 14:58.917
I don't know why
I listened to you.

14:58.919 --> 15:01.136
He's not wrong.

15:02.856 --> 15:06.107
It was your crackpot idea
that he deserves love.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.444
You know, you need to start
raising your hand

15:09.446 --> 15:10.612
before you speak.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.649
Yes, starting now.

15:16.403 --> 15:17.986
Bert, you're a good guy;
you deserve a woman

15:17.988 --> 15:19.988
who's interested in
more than just your money.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.990
She was also interested
in walking around my house

15:21.992 --> 15:23.124
in her underwear.

15:23.126 --> 15:26.478
Now the only one
doing that is me.

15:28.381 --> 15:31.666
If you're that upset,
go get her back.

15:31.668 --> 15:32.717
I tried.

15:32.719 --> 15:34.502
She's not answering my calls.

15:34.504 --> 15:37.922
Which really hurts
because I bought her that phone.

15:39.342 --> 15:41.559
I made a huge mistake.

15:41.561 --> 15:42.977
No, you didn't.

15:42.979 --> 15:45.313
Okay? Look, Bert,
when I had money,

15:45.315 --> 15:47.682
I dated lots of girls
who weren't right for me.

15:47.684 --> 15:49.234
And then I gave
up my money,

15:49.236 --> 15:51.352
and now I'm alone and
living with my friends,

15:51.354 --> 15:55.006
and somebody else should
probably talk now.

15:56.593 --> 15:58.359
Look, sweetie,

15:58.361 --> 16:00.078
relationships
aren't about money, okay?

16:00.080 --> 16:02.163
It's about respect
and having things in common

16:02.165 --> 16:03.715
and...

16:03.717 --> 16:05.200
Yes, Sheldon?

16:05.202 --> 16:07.035
You and Leonard
don't have anything in common.

16:07.037 --> 16:09.120
Maybe you should break up.

16:10.674 --> 16:12.507
You called on him.

16:16.746 --> 16:19.214
Guess who's home from day care?

16:20.884 --> 16:22.967
It's Halley.

16:22.969 --> 16:24.185
Unless somebody else put an “X”

16:24.187 --> 16:26.888
on the bottom
of their kid's foot.

16:26.890 --> 16:29.557
You realize they called
when you took her.

16:32.229 --> 16:36.064
Guess who's
home from the aquarium?

16:38.919 --> 16:40.785
Sorry again
for barging in.

16:40.787 --> 16:42.737
You don't have to go.
You're welcome to hang with us.

16:42.739 --> 16:45.740
Actually, our friendship
group is at capacity.

16:45.742 --> 16:49.577
But if anybody drops out,
you're at the top of the list.

16:51.131 --> 16:52.413
Unless it's Raj,

16:52.415 --> 16:55.567
in which case, we'll probably
get a person of color.

16:58.271 --> 17:00.471
You guys are nice,
but I'm just gonna

17:00.473 --> 17:04.425
buy Rebecca a Jet Ski
and see if that gets her back.

17:04.426 --> 17:07.561
I feel bad for Bert.

17:07.564 --> 17:09.981
So he's using his money
to attract a mate.

17:09.983 --> 17:12.099
Is that any different
than me using my intelligence

17:12.102 --> 17:13.318
to attract Amy?

17:13.319 --> 17:16.604
Or Leonard using his power
of groveling to get Penny?

17:18.108 --> 17:19.324
It's totally different.

17:19.326 --> 17:20.575
Bert's money might run out,

17:20.577 --> 17:23.111
but I can beg
until the end of time.

17:24.865 --> 17:28.449
All that
<i>and</i> he's shorter than me.

17:30.754 --> 17:34.455
Sheldon, what did Amy have
that attracted you?

17:34.457 --> 17:36.307
Oh, so many things.

17:36.309 --> 17:38.877
Her mind, her kindness,

17:38.879 --> 17:41.713
and especially her body.

17:41.715 --> 17:42.797
Really?

17:42.799 --> 17:44.832
Relax.
We're the same blood type.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.969
He knew he could
harvest an organ.

17:56.848 --> 17:58.598
She does look happy.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.134
See? This is
the right thing for her.

18:01.136 --> 18:03.403
Let's all just
go to work.

18:09.227 --> 18:11.277
Anytime.

18:11.279 --> 18:14.664
Let me just say good-bye.

18:15.534 --> 18:18.501
Halley. Look at Mommy.

18:19.338 --> 18:21.204
Over here, honey.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.958
Say good-bye to Mommy!

18:25.844 --> 18:27.293
Look at me!

18:27.295 --> 18:29.346
Look at your mother!

18:32.434 --> 18:34.551
All right, we can go.

18:37.806 --> 18:39.155
Hello.

18:39.157 --> 18:40.724
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

18:40.726 --> 18:42.659
And I'm
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

18:42.661 --> 18:44.227
Based on the
glowing reception

18:44.229 --> 18:46.763
of our recent <i>Behind</i>
<i>the Flags</i> retrospective,

18:46.765 --> 18:49.666
we thought you might like to
see how it all came together.

18:49.668 --> 18:53.069
So welcome
to tonight's episode...

18:53.071 --> 18:54.471
<i>Fun with Flags:</i>

<i>Behind the Flags:</i>

18:56.458 --> 18:58.625
<i>A Retrospective Retrospective.</i>

19:00.729 --> 19:02.796
Ooh, we already have
our first call.

19:02.798 --> 19:04.330
Oh.

19:04.332 --> 19:07.000
Hello, you're on
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

19:07.002 --> 19:08.952
The Jet Ski worked.
I got her back.
