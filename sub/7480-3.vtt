so, if you're driving into work,

00:24.438 --> 00:25.671
you should snap a photo

01:20.444 --> 01:22.445
We're gonna try to to get down.

01:22.529 --> 01:24.697

Lethal injection

01:54.428 --> 01:56.046
Not really fair

I'm just saying the comparison

01:58.299 --> 01:59.099
Hetty and Hunter.

01:59.183 --> 02:00.300
Pick your poison.

02:00.384 --> 02:01.518
Hetty's more like

02:01.585 --> 02:03.053
that little pill
you slip in someone's drink

02:03.104 --> 02:04.271

(chuckles)

02:08.860 --> 02:10.026
CALLEN:
I trust Hetty.

02:10.094 --> 02:11.645
Can't say the same thing
about Hunter.

02:11.729 --> 02:13.814
Okay, listen, Hunter's
just trying to do her job.

02:13.898 --> 02:15.649
And she's obviously isn't gonna
get the love

02:15.733 --> 02:17.067
and respect
that we give Hetty,

02:17.118 --> 02:18.702
so she uses other
leadership tools.

02:18.769 --> 02:20.036
Right. Like secrecy.

02:20.104 --> 02:21.037
And ruthlessness.

02:21.105 --> 02:22.155
No problem using others

02:22.240 --> 02:23.490
to achieve her own agenda.

02:23.574 --> 02:25.775
She is not that bad.

02:25.827 --> 02:27.777
Okay, is there a reason
you keep defending her?

02:27.829 --> 02:30.163
No.

02:30.248 --> 02:31.131
- No reason.
- No?

02:31.215 --> 02:32.299
I'm just, you know,

02:32.383 --> 02:33.884
I mean, she did upgrade

02:33.951 --> 02:35.552
all the hardware around here.

02:35.619 --> 02:36.953
- Uh-huh
- Yeah.

02:37.004 --> 02:39.389
She got us those brand-new
HK-416 assault rifles.

02:39.456 --> 02:40.757
Gave me a parking space.

02:40.808 --> 02:42.625
- Ha! There it is.
- What?!

02:42.677 --> 02:43.626
Turning traitor for parking.

02:43.678 --> 02:44.511
No.

02:44.595 --> 02:45.562
Traitor.

02:45.629 --> 02:47.247
Says the guy that
has a five-second

02:47.315 --> 02:49.850

02:49.934 --> 02:51.902
Oh, quit while
you're ahead, Deeks.

02:51.969 --> 02:52.936
I'm ahead?

02:52.987 --> 02:54.271
ERIC:

02:54.322 --> 02:57.807
Hate to break up the conclave,

02:57.859 --> 02:59.075
Gosh, I miss that whistle.

02:59.143 --> 03:00.243
DEEKS: Yeah, I didn't
miss the whistle.

03:00.311 --> 03:02.195
Did you guys miss
the whistle?

03:02.280 --> 03:04.781
- Nope. - Nah.
- Not really.

03:07.251 --> 03:08.368
Eric.

03:08.452 --> 03:10.320
Footage is from the local

03:10.371 --> 03:12.172
CBS affiliate's

03:15.659 --> 03:19.062
ERIC:
Watch the black SUV.

03:19.130 --> 03:21.164
NELL: The driver was killed
instantly by the blast.

03:21.215 --> 03:23.600
Staff Sergeant Nelson Marcos,
U.S. Marine.

03:23.667 --> 03:27.554
Marcos was a combat engineer
specializing in demolitions.

03:27.638 --> 03:29.189
So what's our angle?

03:29.273 --> 03:32.142
Homeland Security?
Terrorism?

03:32.193 --> 03:33.176
Espionage?

03:33.227 --> 03:35.445
Staff Sergeant
Marcos was a Marine.

03:35.512 --> 03:38.114
Isn't that reason enough?

03:38.182 --> 03:40.784
Eric, play it back
at half speed.

03:42.486 --> 03:43.820
Zoom in on the blue sedan

03:43.871 --> 03:45.372
coming up on the SUV.

03:45.456 --> 03:47.190
See that? Slowed down.

03:47.241 --> 03:51.361
They made sure it was him before
they remote-detonated the bomb.

03:51.412 --> 03:53.213
Sedan was
I.D.'ing the driver.

03:53.297 --> 03:54.915
Everyone else slows down

03:54.999 --> 03:56.750
when the sedan
accelerates away.

03:56.834 --> 04:00.337
The SUV belongs
to Calvin Winslow.

04:00.388 --> 04:02.339
<i>The</i> Calvin Winslow?

04:02.390 --> 04:04.257
Guy runs the biggest
club in L.A.

04:04.342 --> 04:05.926
Hottest people, best DJs,
toughest door in town.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.812
I mean, people spend more time
behind those velvet ropes

04:08.879 --> 04:10.380
than they do inside
the actual club.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.602
Or so I've heard.

04:15.686 --> 04:19.656
The ATF suspects
Winslow is using his club

04:19.723 --> 04:22.492
as a front to move small
arms to the city's gangs.

04:22.559 --> 04:24.027
Looks like
his former partner

04:24.078 --> 04:25.695
is about to open up
his own club.

04:25.746 --> 04:27.580
DEEKS:
Thom Baird came up

04:27.665 --> 04:29.366
as Winslow's protegé,
then he jumped ship.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.201
They had a falling out,
and now they're competitors.

04:31.252 --> 04:32.902
Drama in clubland.

04:32.954 --> 04:34.955
No criminal records
for Winslow or Baird.

04:35.039 --> 04:38.091
All right, visit Winslow
and see what he knows.

04:38.175 --> 04:39.626
We'll check out
the victim,

04:39.710 --> 04:41.845
Nelson Marcos.

04:41.912 --> 04:43.579
I've made
some operational changes.

04:44.748 --> 04:46.516
Callen, you'll be working
with Kensi,

04:46.583 --> 04:47.884
Sam with Deeks.

04:48.886 --> 04:50.420
Partner up.

04:51.555 --> 04:53.556
I'm sure you'll
all make this work.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.282
Why are you doing this?

05:03.734 --> 05:05.785
Your hostility towards me is
affecting the team's work.

05:05.870 --> 05:06.903
No, it's not.

05:06.954 --> 05:08.438
The team is doing
just fine.

05:08.489 --> 05:10.657
Whatever hostility I have
is not about them.

05:10.741 --> 05:11.607
It's about you.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.461
I can't trust anybody

05:14.545 --> 05:16.329
that withholds information
about my past; my life.

05:16.414 --> 05:19.382
And yet you trust Hetty.

05:21.052 --> 05:23.169
If I told you what was
on Alexa Comescu's laptop

05:23.254 --> 05:26.256
in Romania, would
that gain your trust?

05:26.307 --> 05:29.059
It'd be a good place to start.

05:31.012 --> 05:33.513
The Comescu family's real
business is money.

05:33.597 --> 05:36.149
Clean money.

05:36.233 --> 05:37.767
They provide hundreds of
criminal enterprises

05:37.818 --> 05:39.736
all around the world with
start-up loans.

05:39.803 --> 05:43.306
And in exchange for those funds,
the family gets part ownership.

05:46.327 --> 05:48.361
I thought they were involved
in human trafficking.

05:48.446 --> 05:49.696
Yeah, they were.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.082
Along with narcotics, terrorism
and counterfeit goods.

05:52.149 --> 05:54.334
If you were a criminal
looking for an investor,

05:54.402 --> 05:55.869
you'd call the Comescus.

05:55.953 --> 05:58.788
And if your business failed?

05:58.839 --> 06:01.291
You die.

06:05.096 --> 06:07.347
The laptop is just
the tip of the iceberg.

06:07.431 --> 06:10.016
My investigation's still got
a long way to go. It's...

06:10.101 --> 06:11.101
Your investigation?

06:13.304 --> 06:15.388
Authorized by Director Vance.

06:15.473 --> 06:17.390
And you report to...?

06:17.475 --> 06:20.176
Hetty.

06:22.396 --> 06:27.067
There's nothing about you
on the laptop, Agent Callen.

06:27.151 --> 06:29.486
The answers that you're
looking for, they...

06:31.489 --> 06:32.989
they died with Alexa Comescu

06:33.040 --> 06:35.041
in Romania.

06:42.216 --> 06:44.384
Parking space is just
a piece of asphalt.

06:44.468 --> 06:45.885
It's not worth Sam.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.303
You think I
don't know that?

06:47.371 --> 06:48.721
So we have to do something.

06:48.806 --> 06:50.390
Orders are orders.
(sighs)

06:50.474 --> 06:51.391
Do what we're told.

06:51.475 --> 06:52.592
Make it a lot easier.

06:52.676 --> 06:53.810
All right.

06:53.877 --> 06:55.979
You ready for the Marty
Deeks crash course?

06:56.046 --> 06:57.263
Can you teach it
from the hospital?

06:57.348 --> 06:59.682
Okay.

07:04.388 --> 07:05.605
Hey.

07:05.689 --> 07:08.024
Is there something that I
should know about Cal...

07:10.077 --> 07:12.228
Is there something I
should know about Callen?

07:12.279 --> 07:15.281
I know he's had a tough time
with Hetty and Romania and...

07:15.366 --> 07:16.499
He's fine.

07:16.567 --> 07:17.951
Just watch him with Hunter.

07:18.035 --> 07:19.669
Okay.

07:19.736 --> 07:21.571
So you, uh, got any tips for me

07:21.622 --> 07:23.456
on how to housebreak
an angry Navy SEAL?

07:23.541 --> 07:24.507
Yeah, let him drive.

07:24.575 --> 07:26.376
That's it?

07:30.347 --> 07:32.549
Don't be afraid
to take the lead.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.384
Assert your authority.

07:34.435 --> 07:36.886
Let him know you're
comfortable being in charge.

07:39.523 --> 07:40.940
Really?

07:41.025 --> 07:43.977
It's actually the only
way to win his respect.

07:44.061 --> 07:45.562
Kens?

07:45.613 --> 07:47.564
Yeah.

07:47.615 --> 07:49.649
(clears throat)

07:49.733 --> 07:51.818
So I was doing a little bit
of thinking over here,

07:51.902 --> 07:53.903
and I was thinking maybe
we should take my car.

07:58.576 --> 08:00.043
Yeah, that's a good idea.

08:00.110 --> 08:02.495
We should probably
take your car.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.748
'Cause mine is
much further.

08:05.799 --> 08:07.116
Yours is
probably closer.

08:07.168 --> 08:08.168
Yeah, good plan.

08:08.252 --> 08:09.619
We should take
your car.

08:19.513 --> 08:21.097
Dead guy's house.

08:21.148 --> 08:22.732
Yep.

08:24.735 --> 08:26.786
I know what's wrong here.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.688
Do tell.

08:28.772 --> 08:32.275
There can only be one
alpha male in a partnership.

08:32.326 --> 08:33.893
- Alpha male.
- Yeah.

08:33.961 --> 08:35.128
Dominant
authority figure.

08:35.196 --> 08:36.162
Yep.

08:36.230 --> 08:37.330
Leader of the pack.

08:37.414 --> 08:41.116
Problem is, we got ourselves
a pack of two.

08:41.168 --> 08:43.836
And how does a pack
resolve this issue, Deeks?

08:43.921 --> 08:45.488
You watch the
Nature Channel, right?

08:47.007 --> 08:48.758
Pack of wolves, the alpha male

08:48.825 --> 08:52.161
maintains eye contact to assert
dominance over the betas.

08:57.301 --> 08:58.968
Anybody ever tell you
your left eye

08:59.019 --> 09:00.470
is bigger than your right eye?

09:00.521 --> 09:02.055
What?

09:02.139 --> 09:05.007
Let's go, Alpha.

09:05.059 --> 09:09.646
Exactly. Exactly my point,
'cause I'm obviously not Beta.

09:09.697 --> 09:12.649
Just saying.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.368
According to his Marine
file, Marcos lived alone.

09:21.358 --> 09:23.359
Let's take a look
around back.

09:32.753 --> 09:34.203
Federal agent!

09:42.346 --> 09:43.846
Okay, that's my face

09:43.897 --> 09:45.365
you just stepped on.

09:45.432 --> 09:48.268
Please do something stupid
so my partner can shoot you.

09:48.335 --> 09:49.519
Why'd you run?

09:49.570 --> 09:50.870
Bomb.

10:16.122 --> 10:17.840
DEEKS: All right, bomb squad
cleared the house.

10:17.907 --> 10:19.591
I took a look around,
didn't find anything,

10:19.676 --> 10:23.429
which means that, uh, Paul
Bunyan here is our best lead.

10:23.513 --> 10:24.596
How original.

10:24.681 --> 10:27.466
Never heard that one
before, tough guy.

10:27.550 --> 10:30.052
Took you down, didn't I?

10:30.103 --> 10:31.220
Yeah, I was impressed.

10:31.271 --> 10:33.255
No one's ever beat up
the soles of my shoes

10:33.306 --> 10:34.356
with his face like that.

10:34.423 --> 10:35.974
I know you do
not want me

10:36.059 --> 10:37.559
to go alpha male
on you right now.

10:37.610 --> 10:38.560
Try me.

10:38.611 --> 10:40.428
Relax, Gigantor.

10:44.117 --> 10:46.819
I will drop you like
third period French.

10:46.903 --> 10:48.987
You think about that.

10:49.072 --> 10:51.957
(chuckles)

10:52.041 --> 10:54.042
Kensi probably doesn't need
to know about that whole

10:54.110 --> 10:56.879
beating up the soles of his
shoes with my face thing, right?

10:59.916 --> 11:01.166
Good talk.

11:01.251 --> 11:04.386
I'm going to go
check out the blast zone.

11:13.963 --> 11:15.397
Are you okay?

11:15.464 --> 11:16.732
I've been better.

11:16.799 --> 11:18.383
Is it Hunter?

11:18.451 --> 11:20.686
Motion sickness.

11:20.770 --> 11:22.771
I am a great driver.

11:22.822 --> 11:24.523
Not even close.

11:25.975 --> 11:28.410
Okay, Deeks doesn't have to know
you feel this way, right?

11:28.477 --> 11:30.112
Hey, Callen?

11:30.163 --> 11:32.197
(siren wailing)

11:33.482 --> 11:34.933
All right.
Thanks, Eric.

11:35.001 --> 11:36.435
Yeah.

11:36.503 --> 11:39.171
On our way to Winslow's
when we got the news.

11:39.255 --> 11:41.123
- You and Deeks okay?
- Yeah.

11:42.592 --> 11:43.842
You car sick?

11:43.927 --> 11:45.677
KENSI:
What...? No...

11:46.713 --> 11:48.380
So who's Goliath?

11:48.464 --> 11:50.799
What's next,
beanstalk jokes?

11:50.850 --> 11:51.934
SAM:
It's Charles Redman.

11:52.001 --> 11:54.019
Tell them what you told me

11:54.103 --> 11:55.354
about Staff
Sergeant Marcos.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.306
Look, Nelson was my friend.

11:57.357 --> 11:59.474
He let me crash here
on nights I worked late.

11:59.526 --> 12:01.226
Worked late doing what?

12:01.311 --> 12:03.678
Cabaret hospitality
specialist.

12:03.730 --> 12:05.697
(chuckles)

12:05.782 --> 12:06.949
He's a nightclub bouncer.

12:11.037 --> 12:12.371
Knew that guy looked familiar.

12:12.455 --> 12:13.872
Mm-hmm.

12:13.957 --> 12:15.240
You two
know each other?

12:15.325 --> 12:16.575
No.

12:16.659 --> 12:19.328
Last Thursday at the club--
tried to cut the line.

12:19.379 --> 12:21.630
Told people you starred
in that vampire movie.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.749
Kensi, that's...
I was undercover there.

12:23.833 --> 12:25.918
I was... I was following up
that lead with the guy.

12:26.002 --> 12:27.135
Remember the case
with the thing?

12:27.203 --> 12:29.004
No.
(Deeks chuckles)

12:29.055 --> 12:30.222
You don't seem real upset

12:30.306 --> 12:31.590
about your friend's murder,
Mr. Redman.

12:31.674 --> 12:34.042
Didn't know
until you guys told me.

12:34.093 --> 12:36.094
Still hasn't hit me, I guess.

12:37.263 --> 12:38.597
Bomb squad just said

12:38.681 --> 12:40.682
that the, uh, shed
was an explosives factory.

12:40.733 --> 12:43.602
Said they found residue
of military-grade C-4.

12:43.686 --> 12:45.854
You want to explain that to us?

12:47.991 --> 12:51.026
I will-- if you protect me.

12:51.077 --> 12:52.995
From who?

12:54.831 --> 12:56.999
Calvin Winslow.

13:01.204 --> 13:02.921
ERIC:
LAPD found the blue sedan

13:03.006 --> 13:04.756
abandoned just a few blocks
from the freeway.

13:04.841 --> 13:06.758
Reported stolen
30 minutes earlier.

13:06.843 --> 13:08.126
Any link to the explosion?

13:08.211 --> 13:09.678
There was a burn phone inside.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.880
Betting that's what they used
to detonate the bomb.

13:11.931 --> 13:13.799
Anything on Redman?

13:13.883 --> 13:15.767
Well, bank records show
he was telling the truth

13:15.852 --> 13:17.752
about working the door
at Calvin Winslow's club.

13:17.804 --> 13:19.521
He also did two years
in the Army.

13:19.588 --> 13:21.223
CALLEN: All right, let's
work this guy, Eric.

13:21.274 --> 13:22.591
Monitor the interview--
track his answers.

13:22.659 --> 13:23.976
Update us on our comms.

13:24.060 --> 13:28.030
Sam, let's find out why Redman
is so scared of Winslow.

13:33.036 --> 13:35.954
I didn't realize being
a cabaret hospitality specialist

13:36.039 --> 13:37.906
was such a dangerous job.

13:37.957 --> 13:40.792
Why do you need
protection from Winslow?

13:40.877 --> 13:42.878
He's got some guys--

13:42.945 --> 13:45.080
they've laid beatings
on employees.

13:45.131 --> 13:46.832
Maybe worse.

13:46.916 --> 13:49.501
These guys kill
Staff Sergeant Marcos?

13:50.553 --> 13:52.504
I don't know.

13:54.590 --> 13:56.725
Look, we were buddies
since high school.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.727
I got him gigs
working security with me

13:58.794 --> 14:00.395
at the club
when he was off duty.

14:00.463 --> 14:04.433
Marcos was driving one of
Winslow's SUVs when it exploded.

14:09.105 --> 14:12.441
Winslow chauffeurs VIP clients
to the club.

14:13.642 --> 14:15.861
He uses us as drivers sometimes.

14:15.945 --> 14:17.679
(computer beeps)

14:17.747 --> 14:19.281
I just received
a preliminary report

14:19.332 --> 14:21.166
from the LAPD Bomb Squad.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.085
The device that killed Marcos
was of the same design

14:23.152 --> 14:24.836
as the one that took out
the storage shed.

14:24.921 --> 14:25.854
Photos?

14:25.922 --> 14:27.956
Coming up.

14:28.007 --> 14:30.208
So what did Marcos do
to Winslow?

14:30.293 --> 14:33.011
Few nights ago,
I crashed at Marcos's place.

14:33.096 --> 14:35.847
Found some gear
stashed in a closet.

14:35.915 --> 14:37.265
Explosives.

14:37.333 --> 14:40.185
Kind of stuff
the military uses.

14:40.269 --> 14:43.105
I confronted him,
and he said he stole it.

14:43.172 --> 14:45.474
Somebody hired him
to make a bomb.

14:45.525 --> 14:47.309
Winslow?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.111
He wouldn't tell me.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.232
So what were you doing
in that shed this morning?

14:54.317 --> 14:56.234
I got woken up by noises.

14:56.319 --> 14:58.403
I heard somebody out back.

14:58.488 --> 15:02.324
It was just sitting there
on the workbench.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.127
It was wired to a cell phone.

15:05.194 --> 15:06.712
The phone's alarm
was counting down.

15:06.796 --> 15:08.580
Look, I just got
the hell of there.

15:08.664 --> 15:10.832
When was the last time
you spoke with Winslow?

15:10.883 --> 15:13.168
Maybe a week ago, at the club.

15:13.219 --> 15:14.836
I'm seeing over
a dozen calls

15:14.887 --> 15:16.505
to Winslow
from Redman's cell phone

15:16.556 --> 15:18.507
over the past two weeks.

15:18.574 --> 15:20.258
SAM:
Then explain the calls

15:20.343 --> 15:22.010
made to Winslow
from your cell phone.

15:22.061 --> 15:24.012
I told you,
I didn't call Winslow.

15:24.063 --> 15:26.598
Marcos uses my phone sometimes.

15:26.682 --> 15:28.183
It had to be him.

15:28.234 --> 15:29.985
Step outside, gentlemen.

15:30.052 --> 15:32.354
There's something
I need you to see.

15:36.409 --> 15:38.777
Well, clearly,
he's feeling guilty.

15:38.861 --> 15:41.279
And clearly, he's
covering his own ass.

15:41.364 --> 15:43.115
These are evidence photos

15:43.199 --> 15:44.449
of the bomb remnants

15:44.534 --> 15:46.251
from the freeway
and from the shed.

15:46.335 --> 15:48.336
Your assessment, Agent Hanna.

15:48.404 --> 15:52.124
I'd say both bombs were built
by the same person.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.543
Common design elements.

15:54.594 --> 15:56.511
Same type of
tape, wire.

15:56.579 --> 15:58.146
And both bombs
are equipped

15:58.214 --> 15:59.931
with two cell
phone triggers.

16:00.016 --> 16:01.800
The first phone
receives a signal

16:01.884 --> 16:03.185
and triggers the blast.

16:03.252 --> 16:05.187
The companion phone
takes that signal

16:05.254 --> 16:07.472
and transmits it
to other devices.

16:07.557 --> 16:10.142
These types of bombs are
designed to be used together.

16:10.226 --> 16:12.644
It's like the first device
can trigger the second,

16:12.728 --> 16:15.480
and the second can trigger
a third, and so on.

16:15.565 --> 16:17.149
It's a chain of explosions.

16:17.233 --> 16:18.950
A chain meant for what?

16:19.035 --> 16:21.119
To destroy something big.

16:21.204 --> 16:22.804
You were the weird kid
on the playground

16:22.872 --> 16:24.122
obsessed with fire, weren't you?

16:24.207 --> 16:25.490
I'm just saying.

16:25.575 --> 16:26.875
That's my assessment.

16:26.942 --> 16:30.128
You might want to take
a look at this.

16:30.213 --> 16:33.582
Uh, Marcos had security cameras
at the back of his house.

16:33.633 --> 16:36.418
The only one who went inside
the shed today was Redman.

16:36.469 --> 16:39.421
ERIC: Camp Pendleton's reported
12 pounds of C-4

16:39.472 --> 16:41.089
missing from
an ammo supply point,

16:41.140 --> 16:43.558
along with a crate
of blasting caps.

16:43.626 --> 16:46.645
Staff Sergeant Nelson Marcos
had access to that location.

16:46.729 --> 16:49.347
DEEKS:
Paul Bunyan is screwed.

16:49.432 --> 16:51.733
You used Marcos.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.401
You convinced him
to steal

16:53.469 --> 16:54.986
plastic explosives
from Pendleton

16:55.071 --> 16:56.855
and make bombs
for money.

16:56.939 --> 16:59.024
You were the only one in
that shed this morning.

16:59.108 --> 17:01.476
Marcos never called Winslow
from your cell-- it was you.

17:02.662 --> 17:04.613
So...

17:04.664 --> 17:06.314
want to start over?

17:08.651 --> 17:11.086
Winslow killed Nelson.

17:13.089 --> 17:14.705
But it was my fault.

17:17.425 --> 17:20.045
Winslow knew I was
ex-military, but...

17:20.128 --> 17:22.631
I really didn't have the
expertise for what he wanted.

17:22.682 --> 17:24.633
So I told him about Nelson.

17:24.684 --> 17:28.019
He offered us $100,000
for five bombs

17:28.104 --> 17:30.105
rigged to cell phone
detonators.

17:32.024 --> 17:34.860
I talked Nelson into helping me.

17:34.944 --> 17:36.394
Why'd he kill him?

17:38.648 --> 17:39.898
'Cause Nelson changed his mind

17:39.982 --> 17:42.083
after he found out
what the target was.

17:42.151 --> 17:43.318
What was the target?

17:43.369 --> 17:44.619
I don't know.

17:44.687 --> 17:47.205
He called me after he left,
said he'd tell me

17:47.290 --> 17:49.241
when he got back.

17:49.325 --> 17:50.375
Said Winslow needed four bombs

17:50.459 --> 17:52.160
for the first target
and one for the second.

17:54.463 --> 17:56.414
Guess he was the second.

17:58.668 --> 18:00.719
I should have gone with him.

18:00.803 --> 18:03.588
I knew he
was having doubts.

18:06.842 --> 18:08.843
I got my friend killed.

18:12.148 --> 18:14.649
After I heard the
news, I panicked.

18:14.717 --> 18:18.353
When we got hired, Nelson made
a sample bomb for Winslow.

18:18.404 --> 18:20.405
That's what I used
to level the shed.

18:20.489 --> 18:22.240
You know,  prints
were all over

18:22.325 --> 18:23.775
the explosives,
the detonators.

18:23.859 --> 18:27.696
It just seemed
like the easiest way to destroy

18:27.747 --> 18:30.615
all the evidence
before the cops arrived.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.201
Four devices.

18:33.252 --> 18:35.453
One target.

18:35.538 --> 18:38.573
We could be looking
at half a city block.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.773
Redman seemed
genuinely remorseful.

18:54.824 --> 18:56.542
More like genuinely scared.

18:56.609 --> 18:58.827
Think we got enough
to charge Winslow?

18:58.912 --> 19:00.529
Motive would be good.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.998
The ATF has been
after Winslow for years.

19:03.082 --> 19:04.666
This case needs
to be airtight.

19:04.751 --> 19:07.586
So let's bring Winslow in,
apply a little pressure.

19:07.653 --> 19:10.873
Redman's word against his,
and his highly paid lawyers?

19:10.957 --> 19:13.325
So we tell him that we know
about the other four devices.

19:13.376 --> 19:15.177
At the very least, it
stops him from using them.

19:15.261 --> 19:17.162
- Doesn't lock him up.
- Does save lives.

19:18.848 --> 19:20.215
What's our mission here again?

19:21.684 --> 19:23.635
Sam...

19:23.686 --> 19:25.387
do you think
that we can use Redman

19:25.471 --> 19:27.005
to get inside
Winslow's organization?

19:31.510 --> 19:33.395
If Winslow still
trusts him,

19:33.479 --> 19:35.564
and if Redman's willing
to work with us.

19:35.648 --> 19:36.982
Well, Redman
is feeling guilty.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.151
Maybe he wants
to redeem himself.

19:39.202 --> 19:41.703
Maybe.

19:41.788 --> 19:43.739
Worth a shot, then.

19:45.358 --> 19:48.360
I need to organize some
logistics with Eric first.

19:48.411 --> 19:50.212
Do that.

19:51.748 --> 19:54.983
I'll go accompany my partner.

19:56.636 --> 19:58.637
The ATF has had Winslow
under surveillance.

19:58.704 --> 20:00.538
They've confirmed
that he's got a mistress.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.841
Her name is Ashley Thomas.

20:02.892 --> 20:06.061
I'm going to need
real-time updates.

20:11.217 --> 20:13.318
When is Hetty coming back?

20:14.771 --> 20:17.389
Good question.

20:23.863 --> 20:25.747
DEEKS:
Winslow's club.

20:25.832 --> 20:27.032
So you want
to rehearse?

20:27.083 --> 20:29.201
Rehearse what?

20:29.252 --> 20:31.003
I usually run lines
before an undercover op,

20:31.070 --> 20:33.455
but, you know,
maybe that's just me.

20:33.539 --> 20:35.457
Want to get your hair
and makeup done, too?

20:35.541 --> 20:37.209
(chuckling)

20:37.260 --> 20:39.761
I'm just very committed
to my craft.

20:39.846 --> 20:41.046
I just go with the flow.

20:41.097 --> 20:42.881
Ah, improv guy.
I like it.

20:42.932 --> 20:45.350
Me, I like to get a little
Method with it, you know?

20:45.418 --> 20:46.885
But, whatever,
improv's fine, too.

20:48.605 --> 20:50.305
Which one of us
is the more

20:50.390 --> 20:51.640
dominant presence
in this partnership?

20:51.724 --> 20:52.724
Don't think; just answer.

20:52.775 --> 20:53.809
(snaps fingers)
Go.

20:53.893 --> 20:56.028
Ignore him, Redman.

20:56.095 --> 20:57.613
You ready?

20:57.697 --> 20:58.763
(sighs)

20:58.815 --> 20:59.982
Not really.

21:00.066 --> 21:01.483
Good.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.318
He'll expect you to be nervous.

21:07.773 --> 21:08.991
That's him.

21:10.710 --> 21:12.828
REDMAN:
That's Winslow.

21:12.895 --> 21:15.130
SAM:
Okay. Give him a few minutes

21:15.214 --> 21:16.948
to settle in, then we move.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.255
So what's
your favorite food?

21:23.306 --> 21:24.556
CALLEN:
Excuse me?

21:24.623 --> 21:25.924
Just breaking the ice.

21:25.975 --> 21:28.460
Kensi, we've known each other
for a long time.

21:28.511 --> 21:31.730
Yeah, but how much do we
really know about each other?

21:31.797 --> 21:32.948
We've always had
Sam and Deeks

21:33.016 --> 21:34.632
as these social
buffers,

21:34.684 --> 21:37.185
and I know you don't
open up to anyone,

21:37.270 --> 21:38.487
but still...

21:38.571 --> 21:40.138
You don't exactly open
up to anyone, either.

21:40.189 --> 21:41.490
Yeah, but I'm
willing to try

21:41.574 --> 21:43.641
for the good
of this partnership.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.027
Okay.

21:45.111 --> 21:47.279
Okay.
I'm listening.

21:47.330 --> 21:49.331
(chuckles)

21:57.090 --> 21:58.590
Just stick to the case.

21:58.657 --> 21:59.791
Agreed.

21:59.842 --> 22:01.376
Agreed. Okay.

22:01.461 --> 22:03.428
Why did Hunter
split us all up?

22:03.496 --> 22:05.547
Oh, wait,
because she can.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.933
She's too calculated
to do it on a whim.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.552
She did it for a reason.

22:10.636 --> 22:12.220
Well, here we are.

22:12.288 --> 22:14.139
Ashley Thomas's unit.

22:14.190 --> 22:15.440
(knocks)

22:17.443 --> 22:19.111
CALLEN:
I don't think she's here.

22:35.328 --> 22:37.195
You sure we have
the right address?

22:37.246 --> 22:38.213
Yeah.

22:38.297 --> 22:40.532
Looks like she moved out.

22:45.188 --> 22:48.090
Or she never moved in.

22:48.174 --> 22:49.674
Okay.

22:49.726 --> 22:50.842
Let's go.

22:50.893 --> 22:52.561
Thanks for letting me do this.

22:52.645 --> 22:54.012
Means a lot.

22:56.015 --> 22:59.234
What's your distress word?

22:59.318 --> 23:00.552
Deeks.

23:02.572 --> 23:05.857
Good luck using that
in a sentence.

23:05.908 --> 23:08.360
SAM:
Okay, Eric, we're on the move.

23:08.411 --> 23:10.779
Read you loud
and very clear, Sam.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.664
(typing)

23:31.584 --> 23:34.352
You got stones, Redman.

23:34.420 --> 23:36.188
Most guys would have
skipped town.

23:36.255 --> 23:38.273
I made a mistake
with Marcos.

23:38.357 --> 23:39.775
Came to set it right.

23:39.859 --> 23:42.060
Who's your friend?

23:42.111 --> 23:43.478
Sam Harris.

23:43.563 --> 23:45.363
Don't know you.

23:45.431 --> 23:47.482
I'm worth getting to know.

23:54.557 --> 23:56.658
You got a problem.

23:56.742 --> 23:58.326
I can fix it.

23:58.411 --> 23:59.911
I got a problem?

24:01.614 --> 24:02.798
Faulty equipment.

24:02.882 --> 24:04.416
Marcos called me.

24:04.467 --> 24:07.252
He said he did something to the
devices so they wouldn't blow.

24:07.303 --> 24:09.421
The one this morning
worked pretty well.

24:09.472 --> 24:11.473
He said he only did it
to four of them.

24:11.557 --> 24:12.724
The ones he planted
for you.

24:12.791 --> 24:15.510
Like I said, faulty equipment.

24:15.595 --> 24:17.512
And you can fix it.

24:17.597 --> 24:20.265
Well, I'd have to see
the equipment to be sure.

24:20.316 --> 24:21.433
It's already on-site.

24:21.484 --> 24:22.567
Gonna cost more.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.486
Why don't you give me
the location.

24:24.570 --> 24:25.687
I'll take a look.

24:25.771 --> 24:28.023
This isn't a negotiation.

24:31.961 --> 24:32.611
(beeping)

24:32.662 --> 24:33.912
Hey, hey, hey.

24:36.616 --> 24:38.750
Is that real?

24:38.817 --> 24:41.503
Half a pound of C4.

24:41.587 --> 24:43.038
The detonator
circuit's complete

24:43.122 --> 24:45.590
soon as I release the
pressure on the switch here.

24:46.825 --> 24:48.593
And the result?
They'll be picking up

24:48.661 --> 24:49.878
the pieces with a wet-vac.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.601
Looks like a negotiation now.

24:56.669 --> 24:59.354
Any luck with
Winslow's mistress?

24:59.438 --> 25:01.506
The apartment was a dead end.

25:03.008 --> 25:05.360
I should be there.

25:05.444 --> 25:08.730
Agent Hanna's got the
situation under control.

25:16.522 --> 25:20.024
This device is a smaller version
of the one Marcos built.

25:21.711 --> 25:23.495
He said when the green light
flashes red,

25:23.546 --> 25:25.213
the device detonates.

25:25.298 --> 25:26.915
Mm-hmm.

25:26.999 --> 25:28.750
Let me see if this works.
No!

25:28.834 --> 25:30.468
(loud pop)

25:31.537 --> 25:32.971
Son of a...

25:33.038 --> 25:34.839
Maybe I should shoot you myself.

25:34.891 --> 25:36.208
(smug chuckle)

25:37.843 --> 25:40.512
I altered the device.

25:40.563 --> 25:42.931
The detonation chain
never reached the C4.

25:43.015 --> 25:44.065
Started and ended

25:44.150 --> 25:45.216
with the blasting cap.

25:45.268 --> 25:49.854
That's the difference
between bang and boom.

25:49.906 --> 25:51.072
Water doesn't compress,

25:51.157 --> 25:53.325
so it stops the explosion
in its tracks.

25:53.392 --> 25:57.028
You can use water
as a barrier.

25:57.079 --> 25:59.197
Place the barrier on the left,
it drives the blast right.

25:59.248 --> 26:01.199
Place the barrier up top,
it drives the blast down.

26:01.250 --> 26:03.368
- Which means?
- You think you're bringing down

26:03.419 --> 26:06.121
a whole building, and you end up
only damaging the floor.

26:06.205 --> 26:09.507
Or you level
an entire city block.

26:11.677 --> 26:13.628
REDMAN: Marcos could've
done this to my bombs.

26:13.713 --> 26:15.297
Looks like it's time for you

26:15.381 --> 26:18.049
to hire a professional,
Mr. Winslow.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.053
I guess I just did.

26:34.104 --> 26:36.271
This guy Winslow has
no shortage of women

26:36.339 --> 26:38.056
hanging off his
arm at his club.

26:38.141 --> 26:39.308
A different one
every night.

26:39.359 --> 26:41.443
So far, I've found only four

26:41.511 --> 26:43.612
with multiple photos
taken on different days.

26:43.679 --> 26:45.731
But none of them go by
the name Ashley Thomas.

26:45.815 --> 26:47.282
What about the ATF?

26:47.350 --> 26:48.617
They had him
under surveillance.

26:48.684 --> 26:50.786
Uh, where do you think
I got the photos?

26:50.853 --> 26:55.023
I also trawled the paparazzi
and various nightlife sites.

26:55.074 --> 26:58.210
Turns out, Winslow doesn't like
to stray far from his own club.

26:58.294 --> 26:59.495
Social networking?

26:59.546 --> 27:01.213
A blank.

27:01.297 --> 27:03.632
Whoever this mistress is,
she's very discreet.

27:05.001 --> 27:06.752
Eric's confirmed that
Ashley Thomas's landlord

27:06.836 --> 27:08.921
received a wire transfer
from a Swiss account

27:09.005 --> 27:10.589
for an amount equaling
12 months rent.

27:10.673 --> 27:11.807
Name of the account holder?

27:11.874 --> 27:13.208
He's still working on it.

27:13.259 --> 27:14.876
He thinks it'll take
several high-level phone calls

27:14.928 --> 27:16.011
for a bank in Geneva

27:16.062 --> 27:18.263
to open up its books.

27:18.348 --> 27:20.365
Which one's Ashley Thomas?

27:20.433 --> 27:21.850
That'd be none of them.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.936
He's going to
an awful lot of trouble

27:24.020 --> 27:26.021
to keep her hidden away.

27:26.089 --> 27:27.856
NELL: Yeah, and I'm
beginning to think

27:27.907 --> 27:29.691
we're not going
to find her.

27:29.742 --> 27:32.110
I'm beginning to think
I know why.

27:38.734 --> 27:40.085
Ashley Thomas.

27:40.170 --> 27:42.204
You found her?

27:42.255 --> 27:43.539
I don't think she exists.

27:43.590 --> 27:46.124
My intel is solid, Agent Callen.

27:46.209 --> 27:48.877
Why'd you choose our team
for this case?

27:48.928 --> 27:51.847
Winslow's not a
high-priority target.

27:51.914 --> 27:53.682
You split us up.

27:53.749 --> 27:55.350
You sent us off chasing ghosts.

27:55.418 --> 27:57.219
Ashley Thomas is not a ghost.

27:57.270 --> 27:59.304
You're keeping us off balance,
you're keeping us busy.

27:59.389 --> 28:00.305
Why?

28:00.390 --> 28:01.940
What's this really about?

28:02.025 --> 28:05.194
You need to keep looking
until she turns up.

28:05.261 --> 28:06.478
And when she doesn't...?

28:08.531 --> 28:09.898
She will.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.834
(phone ringing)

28:15.071 --> 28:16.438
Agent Hunter.

28:16.489 --> 28:18.207
ERIC: Hey, Sam's en route
to another location.

28:18.274 --> 28:19.708
Thank you, Eric.

28:19.775 --> 28:21.577
Sam is on the move.

28:21.628 --> 28:25.130
Give my regards to Ashley
when she turns up.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.234
I know this spot, Eric.

28:45.301 --> 28:47.185
This is where Winslow's
old partner, Thom Baird,

28:47.270 --> 28:48.654
is opening up his new club.

28:48.738 --> 28:52.107
This has got to be where
Winslow's planted the bombs.

28:54.060 --> 28:55.911
SAM:
This one of your clubs, Winslow?

28:55.978 --> 28:56.912
WINSLOW:
No.

28:56.979 --> 28:59.197
(knocks)

29:02.485 --> 29:05.153
We're on the list.

29:05.204 --> 29:06.338
How are you?

29:06.422 --> 29:07.256
HUNTER:
Eric, what's the club's layout?

29:07.323 --> 29:09.207
Main entrance is on your street,

29:09.292 --> 29:10.676
service entrance
around the back,

29:10.760 --> 29:12.210
several other businesses
next door.

29:12.295 --> 29:14.012
It's a big club.

29:14.097 --> 29:16.431
Lot of places to plant a bomb.

29:16.499 --> 29:18.467
Or four.

29:18.518 --> 29:20.435
Deeks, Callen and Kensi
are about to join you.

29:20.503 --> 29:22.354
Backup for the backup,
that's fantastic.

29:22.438 --> 29:23.855
Do we have a plan here?

29:23.940 --> 29:27.392
Hold until Sam has located all
four devices and disabled them.

29:27.477 --> 29:28.393
Then move in.

29:28.478 --> 29:29.478
Simple plan.

29:29.529 --> 29:30.696
What could possibly go wrong?

29:30.780 --> 29:31.647
Plenty.

29:35.118 --> 29:37.035
Uh, Sam just entered
the building.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.404
Eric, is the club open?

29:39.489 --> 29:41.490
Um, no.
Grand opening's in two days.

29:41.541 --> 29:42.824
HUNTER:
Call the nearby businesses.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.710
Tell them
that there's been a gas leak

29:44.794 --> 29:45.911
and they need to evacuate.

29:45.995 --> 29:47.462
Nell, call LAPD
and tell them

29:47.530 --> 29:48.964
they need to
block the street

29:49.031 --> 29:50.082
to through traffic.

29:50.166 --> 29:52.167
No lights, no sirens.

29:58.207 --> 30:00.092
Well, well, well,
if it isn't my ex-partner

30:00.176 --> 30:01.426
and my current partner's
ex-partner.

30:01.511 --> 30:02.594
Where's Sam?

30:02.679 --> 30:04.146
DEEKS:
He's gone clubbing.

30:04.213 --> 30:05.480
- Isn't that owned by Winslow's...
- Ex-partner.

30:05.548 --> 30:07.149
- You couldn't resist, could you?
- I couldn't.

30:07.216 --> 30:08.667
We're gonna have to
evacuate the street.

30:08.735 --> 30:10.018
Hunter's already
on it-- gas leak.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.603
Well, if Winslow sees
the street being evacuated,

30:11.671 --> 30:13.472
- he's gonna know something's up.
- You take the front door.

30:13.539 --> 30:14.956
Soon as the street's clear,
we're going in.

30:15.024 --> 30:16.158
All right.
Deeks, stay with me.

30:16.225 --> 30:17.826
Three partners
in one day.

30:17.893 --> 30:19.144
I'm feeling all giddy.

30:22.332 --> 30:24.166
(earpiece beeps)

30:24.233 --> 30:25.701
Eric, comms up.

30:25.752 --> 30:27.252
Comms up.

30:27.337 --> 30:29.504
Callen and Kensi
are patched in.

30:29.572 --> 30:32.841
Nice-looking club.

30:32.908 --> 30:35.377
NELL: Uh, is he doing
what I think he's doing?

30:35.428 --> 30:37.045
(zips up)

30:37.096 --> 30:38.630
You really don't like this guy.

30:38.715 --> 30:40.382
I made him.

30:40.433 --> 30:42.601
And this is how he repays me.

30:42.685 --> 30:44.186
He's gonna learn
the hard way.

30:46.556 --> 30:48.423
Be easier to just
burn this place.

30:48.474 --> 30:50.942
Why go to all this trouble?

30:51.027 --> 30:53.111
I want to maximize
the pain.

30:53.196 --> 30:56.164
Okay, so where are
the bombs?

30:56.232 --> 30:58.233
Number one.

31:14.217 --> 31:17.118
(steady, quiet beeping)

31:19.222 --> 31:21.223
Yep, dual cell phone
detonators.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.394
Branch of an explosive chain.

31:25.461 --> 31:26.812
This should do it.

31:26.896 --> 31:28.263
Where are the others?

31:28.314 --> 31:31.683
Structural walls front,
back and main stairwell.

31:31.768 --> 31:33.318
Will it work?

31:33.403 --> 31:35.604
If you're asking if it'll
bring down the building, sure.

31:35.655 --> 31:37.272
Long as it detonates.

31:37.323 --> 31:39.324
Well, that's why
you're here.

31:41.611 --> 31:44.029
You got a burn phone
to activate this?

31:46.048 --> 31:48.116
Number's
already entered.

31:48.167 --> 31:52.087
Well, don't pocket-dial
or we'll all be dead.

31:52.154 --> 31:54.155
(laughs)

31:56.158 --> 31:57.793
Perimeter. Start at the front.

31:59.929 --> 32:02.297
Where's he going?

32:02.348 --> 32:04.299
Stretching his legs.

32:04.350 --> 32:05.300
Callen, we've got a tourist.

32:05.351 --> 32:06.601
Heading to the front
of the building.

32:06.669 --> 32:08.270
Kensi, did you get that?
I got it.

32:08.337 --> 32:10.355
Ma'am, hurry up, please.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.807
There's a gas leak.

32:11.858 --> 32:13.775
- Move away from the building.
- Hey, what's going on?

32:13.843 --> 32:16.061
Gas leak. Second
one this week.

32:16.145 --> 32:18.113
I don't know.

32:20.149 --> 32:21.399
Cat's out of the bag, guys.

32:21.484 --> 32:23.401
Kensi, is the street clear?

32:23.469 --> 32:24.453
Almost.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.655
So much for that
simple plan.

32:26.706 --> 32:29.357
(quiet, steady beeping
continuing)

32:32.328 --> 32:33.912
(talking quietly)

32:38.701 --> 32:40.752
WINSLOW:
Street is being evacuated.

32:40.837 --> 32:42.971
Gas leak.

32:43.038 --> 32:44.723
Now, isn't that
a coincidence?

32:44.807 --> 32:46.675
So what are we waiting for?

32:48.377 --> 32:51.012
Well, someone told the cops.

32:56.903 --> 32:59.437
I'm gonna find out who.

33:13.454 --> 33:15.956
SAM: The guy who did this, fixed it
so it wouldn't explode.

33:16.023 --> 33:18.708
I guess good help
is hard to find, huh?

33:18.793 --> 33:22.028
And now I found you.

33:24.048 --> 33:25.198
Talk to me, Eric.

33:25.249 --> 33:26.883
They're in the west corner
of the club.

33:26.968 --> 33:29.085
Sam deactivated the first bomb.

33:29.170 --> 33:30.387
I'm moving in.

33:30.471 --> 33:32.205
Callen, hold your position.

33:35.309 --> 33:37.677
CALLEN:
Kensi, get ready to move in.

33:40.064 --> 33:42.215
Maybe you're not
who you say you are.

33:47.321 --> 33:48.605
It was me.

33:48.689 --> 33:50.690
The cops came to talk to me.

33:50.741 --> 33:52.776
I... might have said something,
Mr. Winslow.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.661
I'm sorry.

33:58.866 --> 33:59.866
So am I.

34:02.903 --> 34:03.837
Redman's down.

34:03.904 --> 34:05.038
Call an ambulance.

34:06.207 --> 34:08.291
CALLEN:
Kensi, move in.

34:10.678 --> 34:13.045
(Redman gasping weakly)

34:21.272 --> 34:22.973
(weakly):
For Nelson.

34:23.056 --> 34:24.690
(labored breathing)

34:24.757 --> 34:27.393
For Nelson.

34:31.565 --> 34:33.617
(groans weakly)

34:33.701 --> 34:35.702
When you don't know
who to trust...

34:35.768 --> 34:37.404
Trust no one.

34:38.539 --> 34:39.456
Federal agents!

34:39.540 --> 34:40.873
(gunshots)

34:40.940 --> 34:42.042
(bodyguard groans)

34:45.112 --> 34:46.446
(groans)

34:47.965 --> 34:49.331
Ow!

34:52.085 --> 34:53.085
(bullet ricochets)

34:54.388 --> 34:56.389
(groans)

34:56.456 --> 34:58.341
(grunting)

34:58.426 --> 34:59.759
(phone beeps)

34:59.810 --> 35:02.062
(grunting)

35:02.129 --> 35:04.347
(beeping) Uh-oh. Someone is using
your cell phone.

35:04.432 --> 35:05.465
Shut it down!

35:05.516 --> 35:07.467
(beeping continues)
Come on, come on!

35:14.058 --> 35:15.909
The call is relaying--
I-I can't stop it!

35:15.976 --> 35:18.445
(phone ringing)

35:19.747 --> 35:22.315
(ringing continues)

35:23.617 --> 35:25.502
(ringing)

35:25.586 --> 35:27.120
This one's safe;
the others aren't.

35:27.171 --> 35:29.372
Callen, get the hell
out of there now!

35:29.457 --> 35:30.707
SAM:
Go, go!

35:30.791 --> 35:32.792
(panting)

35:33.644 --> 35:35.111
(lock jiggling)

35:37.264 --> 35:38.598
(phone ringing, device beeps)

35:38.665 --> 35:40.016
(phone ringing,
device beeps)

35:40.101 --> 35:41.834
(phone ringing, device beeps)

35:42.870 --> 35:44.387
(sighs)

35:44.455 --> 35:46.473
(explosion thunders)

35:50.811 --> 35:52.812
(second explosion booming)

35:55.883 --> 35:58.001
(third explosion thunders)

36:00.687 --> 36:02.455
(explosions booming)

36:02.523 --> 36:04.290
(groans)
Ahh!

36:04.358 --> 36:05.875
(groaning)

36:05.960 --> 36:07.494
(soft grunting)

36:07.545 --> 36:08.745
You okay?

36:08.829 --> 36:10.246
(grunting):
I'm good.

36:10.331 --> 36:11.748
Are you?

36:11.832 --> 36:13.083
(gasping, sighing)

36:13.167 --> 36:14.084
Yeah.

36:14.168 --> 36:15.585
You good?

36:15.669 --> 36:16.753
Yeah.

36:16.837 --> 36:18.054
You?

36:18.139 --> 36:19.372
DEEKS:
I'm good.

36:19.423 --> 36:20.873
(sirens wailing in distance)

36:20.925 --> 36:22.726
HUNTER:
Callen, status?

36:22.810 --> 36:24.260
We're all good.

36:24.345 --> 36:25.595
(Deek grunts loudly)

36:25.679 --> 36:27.480
(all straining, groaning)

36:27.548 --> 36:29.549
(sirens approaching)

36:32.987 --> 36:34.988
(static crackling)

36:37.842 --> 36:40.493
Never a dull moment.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.734
(sighs with relief)

36:50.204 --> 36:51.454
(sighs)

36:51.539 --> 36:56.576
(intermittent beeping)

36:56.627 --> 37:00.513
ERIC: Well, sounds like
you just got a hit.

37:00.581 --> 37:01.848
(two beeps)

37:01.915 --> 37:03.082
(chirps)

37:08.222 --> 37:09.355
Callen?

37:09.423 --> 37:10.890
I found her.

37:12.059 --> 37:14.093
Ashley Thomas.

37:22.870 --> 37:24.821
I don't understand
how this happened.

37:24.905 --> 37:27.824
I did a name search with a
very tight set of parameters

37:27.908 --> 37:30.493
to filter out every other
Ashley Thomas in Los Angeles,

37:30.578 --> 37:31.494
and got nothing--

37:31.562 --> 37:32.829
until now.

37:32.913 --> 37:34.881
Suddenly, her name pops up.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.916
It's like she
was just born.

37:36.967 --> 37:38.351
It's a gossip site.

37:38.419 --> 37:39.869
Story about Calvin Winslow

37:39.937 --> 37:41.554
and his mysterious
new lady love...

37:41.622 --> 37:42.972
Ashley Thomas.

37:43.057 --> 37:44.591
And that's not the only one.

37:44.642 --> 37:47.427
I'm now showing dozens
of entries

37:47.495 --> 37:50.013
from blog sites
to mainstream press.

37:50.097 --> 37:51.347
It's like someone's doing

37:51.432 --> 37:53.349
a massive Ashley Thomas
upload to the net.

37:53.434 --> 37:55.101
You got photos?

37:55.152 --> 37:56.802
Yeah. First one
coming through now.

37:56.854 --> 37:59.355
"Calvin Winslow living
the highlife on the red carpet

37:59.440 --> 38:00.740
with Ashley Thomas."

38:00.807 --> 38:01.774
Open it.

38:01.826 --> 38:03.142
(typing)

38:03.194 --> 38:04.194
(computer trilling)

38:07.147 --> 38:08.698
Oh...

38:08.782 --> 38:09.866
(beeps)

38:09.950 --> 38:11.668
...my God.

38:12.670 --> 38:14.604
Send this to my phone.

38:14.672 --> 38:15.988
(scoffs)

38:16.040 --> 38:17.990
Wow.

38:18.042 --> 38:19.542
(typing)

38:28.269 --> 38:31.254
Looking for someone,
Mr. Callen?

38:33.257 --> 38:35.191
Lange, Henrietta.

38:35.276 --> 38:37.677
In case you've forgotten.

38:37.728 --> 38:40.897
(teapot and cups ratting
on tray)

38:40.981 --> 38:43.566
You're back.

38:43.634 --> 38:47.270
I feel like
I was never gone.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.957
Where's Agent Hunter?

38:51.024 --> 38:53.159
Not looking for me at all, then.

38:55.546 --> 38:57.530
She's gone on assignment.

38:57.581 --> 38:58.915
Why do you ask?

39:00.968 --> 39:03.970
I found somebody
she was looking for.

39:07.057 --> 39:09.375
HETTY: "Calvin Winslow
living the highlife

39:09.426 --> 39:12.712
on the red carpet
with Ashley Thomas."

39:12.763 --> 39:17.267
Miss Thomas bears a striking
resemblance to Agent Hunter,

39:17.351 --> 39:18.884
don't you think?

39:20.487 --> 39:22.405
Hunter was put
in the picture.

39:22.489 --> 39:24.407
She's backstopping
a new alias.

39:24.491 --> 39:26.409
That's what this is
all about, isn't it?

39:26.493 --> 39:28.244
Ashley Thomas
didn't exist

39:28.329 --> 39:32.231
until Hunter created her.

39:32.283 --> 39:36.252
It's what we need to do,
Mr. Callen, to go undercover.

39:36.337 --> 39:38.338
The deeper the cover,

39:38.405 --> 39:41.874
the deeper
the backstopping required.

39:41.926 --> 39:44.060
Agent Hunter saw
this Winslow case

39:44.128 --> 39:47.513
as a way into a much
bigger operation in Europe.

39:47.581 --> 39:49.182
So now Winslow
is dead, but...

39:49.249 --> 39:53.019
Ashley Thomas
is very much alive.

39:53.086 --> 39:56.389
And seeing as she had
quite a relationship

39:56.440 --> 39:58.107
with the late Mr. Winslow,

39:58.192 --> 39:59.776
I'm sure she'll
have no trouble

39:59.860 --> 40:02.278
convincing his friends
in Europe

40:02.363 --> 40:04.697
that she can be trusted.

40:04.765 --> 40:08.201
Does this have anything
to do with the Comescus?

40:08.268 --> 40:10.703
Nothing at all.

40:10.771 --> 40:14.991
In this operation,
their paths never cross.

40:17.544 --> 40:21.080
She never had a dog
in that fight anyway.

40:21.131 --> 40:24.083
Unlike you and I.

40:24.134 --> 40:27.253
You asked me...

40:27.304 --> 40:32.759
why I went off on my own
to face the Comescus.

40:32.810 --> 40:36.796
I did it...
because of your mother.

40:40.901 --> 40:43.820
You knew my mom?

40:43.904 --> 40:47.907
Sit down. I'll tell you
everything I know.

40:48.975 --> 40:51.477
(sighs)

40:52.479 --> 40:53.913
(voice breaks):
Why now?

40:53.980 --> 40:57.283
Because you're safe
from the Comescus now.

40:57.334 --> 41:03.006
And because I can't hold on
to these secrets any longer.

41:03.090 --> 41:05.825
Please, Mr. Callen.

41:15.502 --> 41:18.388
Where do I begin?

41:22.860 --> 41:24.610
What was her name?

41:27.531 --> 41:29.565
Clara.

41:29.650 --> 41:34.787
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

41:34.855 --> 41:36.489
HETTY:
<i>Her name was Clara.</i>
