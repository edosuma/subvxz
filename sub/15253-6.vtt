uple things that you
<i>might need to know</i>

00:03.755 --> 00:05.655
<i>or maybe you just forgot.
</i> I have to find the truth, Morgan-

00:05.688 --> 00:06.922
<i>why my mom left, why she never
came back.</i>

00:06.923 --> 00:07.923
<i>This is my search.</i>

00:07.924 --> 00:10.226
This is all I could find.

00:10.294 --> 00:12.562
<i>I thought she was a prisoner
who needed to be saved.</i>

00:12.630 --> 00:15.956
<i>Then I come to find out she's just
one of the bad guys.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:20.086
Hello.

00:20.153 --> 00:23.754
MARY Hello, Chuck,
it's your mother.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.500 --> 00:50.100
What are you doing back here?

00:50.101 --> 00:51.501
This is a secured area.

00:51.502 --> 00:52.502
Oh.

00:52.503 --> 00:53.736
Oh, I-I'm sorry,

00:53.737 --> 00:55.637
I was just looking for the,
uh, fitness center.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.639
I'll, I'll just be on my way, then.

00:58.706 --> 01:00.340
You're not going anywhere.

01:00.341 --> 01:02.474
Show me your security I.D.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.575
No need to be rough, I...

01:07.379 --> 01:09.279
Aah!

01:11.648 --> 01:13.047
What is this?

01:13.048 --> 01:14.948
I see your hands are shaking.

01:16.784 --> 01:18.784
That means the toxin
is taking effect.

01:18.851 --> 01:20.084
It's flooding

01:20.085 --> 01:22.920
your brain now, turning
your entire consciousness

01:22.987 --> 01:25.889
into one gigantic nightmare.

01:25.956 --> 01:27.456
The only difference is,

01:27.457 --> 01:32.359
this nightmare you
never wake up from.

01:39.198 --> 01:41.832
As you can see...

01:43.034 --> 01:44.901
...my toxin is fully functional.

01:44.902 --> 01:47.102
Impressive, isn't it?

01:49.471 --> 01:51.939
Very impressive, Dr. Wheelwright.

01:54.208 --> 01:57.442
I believe I have a
buyer in Los Angeles

01:57.510 --> 02:00.811
who will be very
interested in this.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.485
Hello.

02:10.553 --> 02:13.487
MARY Hello, Chuck,
it's your mother.

02:14.556 --> 02:17.790
I want to see you in person.

02:17.858 --> 02:19.925
Is this a joke?

02:19.993 --> 02:21.893
Griffith Park, one hour.

02:21.927 --> 02:23.561
Is this, is this, is this a joke?

02:23.562 --> 02:26.996
Mom, you have any idea how
long I've been looking for you

02:27.064 --> 02:28.431
these last couple of months?

02:28.432 --> 02:30.465
Where have you been since
I was nine years old?

02:30.533 --> 02:32.667
Chuck, now is not the time.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.768
Just meet me.

02:34.836 --> 02:36.736
Tell no one.

02:36.771 --> 02:38.671
Come alone.

02:40.007 --> 02:42.040
Okay, bye.

02:45.477 --> 02:47.411
Hey, Ellie's putting out dessert.

02:47.478 --> 02:48.712
If you don't come in soon,

02:48.713 --> 02:51.681
I'm gonna eat it and
blame it on Morgan.

02:51.749 --> 02:52.982
What's the matter?

02:52.983 --> 02:54.984
You look like you've seen a ghost.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.352
I just talked to one.

03:11.529 --> 03:13.463
I had a feeling you
wouldn't show up.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.798
I guess I should have expected it.

03:15.866 --> 03:19.368
Look to your three o'clock.

03:24.374 --> 03:27.943
I had to make sure you came alone.

03:28.010 --> 03:29.411
I did everything you asked.

03:29.412 --> 03:30.678
Why all the secrecy?

03:30.679 --> 03:32.313
I know you've been
working for Volkoff.

03:32.314 --> 03:34.381
You afraid the bad guys
are going to see you

03:34.449 --> 03:36.216
hanging around your own son?

03:36.217 --> 03:39.719
Oh, it's much more
complicated than that, Chuck.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.787
Meet me at the playground.

03:47.193 --> 03:50.528
You just hate saying good-bye
like a normal person, don't you?

04:00.803 --> 04:03.837
Okay, Chuck, I'm in position.

04:07.407 --> 04:09.975
And who are you?

04:11.010 --> 04:13.344
Wow.

04:13.411 --> 04:16.216
I didn't even hear a twig snap.

04:17.586 --> 04:19.721
You must have been doing
this for a long time.

04:19.788 --> 04:21.755
Are you calling me old?

04:21.822 --> 04:23.723
Not old.

04:25.694 --> 04:27.361
Just slow.

04:27.362 --> 04:29.663
Government-issued sidearm.

04:29.731 --> 04:31.331
What are you- CIA,

04:31.332 --> 04:32.766
FBI?

04:32.767 --> 04:34.701
My story is not as
interesting as yours,

04:34.769 --> 04:36.469
so we'll start with you first.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.303
Why did Volkoff send you here?

04:38.304 --> 04:39.303
Oh,

04:39.304 --> 04:40.971
jumping to conclusions, are we?

04:40.972 --> 04:42.606
Oh, I think my conclusions

04:42.607 --> 04:44.374
are pretty justified. I am here

04:44.375 --> 04:46.109
because I need to see... Whoa,
hey, whoa,

04:46.110 --> 04:47.477
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:47.478 --> 04:48.711
Hey there.

04:48.712 --> 04:51.047
How you guys doing?

04:51.114 --> 04:52.114
You brought someone.

04:52.115 --> 04:53.449
I told you to come alone.

04:53.450 --> 04:55.283
No, no, no, no,
technically not just someone.

04:55.284 --> 04:57.585
Okay, Mom, this is
my girlfriend Sarah.

04:58.654 --> 05:01.922
Sarah, this is my mom Mary.

05:01.990 --> 05:03.423
I don't know

05:03.424 --> 05:04.524
how to say this exactly,

05:04.525 --> 05:06.826
but please don't kill each other.

05:11.532 --> 05:15.534
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

05:53.876 --> 05:56.711
Great, great. See, I can see the...

05:56.778 --> 05:59.213
connection already. BFF...

05:59.281 --> 06:01.215
Facebook buddies.

06:01.283 --> 06:02.616
I'll shut up now. I'll shut up.

06:02.617 --> 06:04.385
Did you honestly think
he wouldn't come alone?

06:04.386 --> 06:06.420
I thought maybe he would trust me.

06:06.488 --> 06:08.422
Okay, you know what? Considering
that you left me when I was,

06:08.490 --> 06:09.724
oh, I don't know, nine years old,

06:09.725 --> 06:11.792
and I still don't know
if you're good or bad,

06:11.860 --> 06:13.160
I think I have every right

06:13.161 --> 06:15.061
to have a mother issue
or two right now.

06:17.399 --> 06:19.299
You're right.

06:21.869 --> 06:24.070
You are absolutely right.

06:24.138 --> 06:25.237
Thank you, thank you.

06:25.238 --> 06:27.039
No shooting necessary.
None whatsoever.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.340
Great, good, here we go.

06:28.341 --> 06:30.075
Fully hanging out.
What should we do?

06:30.076 --> 06:31.177
Should we... should we sit down?

06:31.178 --> 06:32.445
I know a wonderful bakery,
actually...

06:32.446 --> 06:34.914
Chuck... Or we could just
hang out here in a...

06:34.981 --> 06:36.881
in a creepy, dark playground.
Where to start?

06:36.916 --> 06:37.916
Ooh, ooh,

06:37.917 --> 06:39.551
I know, I got a story.
Tenth birthday-

06:39.552 --> 06:40.585
you haven't even heard this one-

06:40.586 --> 06:41.686
I ate so much chocolate cake,

06:41.687 --> 06:42.954
I had frosting coming
out of my nose.

06:42.955 --> 06:44.222
I could smell it for a year...

06:44.223 --> 06:46.624
Chuck, Chuck, stop!

06:46.691 --> 06:48.958
I don't want to know
anything about you.

06:49.026 --> 06:50.693
Excuse me?

06:50.694 --> 06:53.195
I am deep undercover in
the Volkoff organization.

06:53.263 --> 06:55.932
And if my cover is blown,
they will torture me for secrets.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.301
I don't want to know
one thing about you

06:58.369 --> 07:00.536
or your sister that
could put you in danger.

07:00.604 --> 07:02.939
So just leave it at that.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.441
You're undercover?

07:04.442 --> 07:07.410
That's funny, because we
didn't find any files on you

07:07.478 --> 07:08.711
in the CIA database.

07:08.712 --> 07:10.146
No, you wouldn't.

07:10.147 --> 07:11.748
When I went undercover

07:11.749 --> 07:13.583
my records were expunged.

07:13.584 --> 07:14.818
That's convenient.

07:14.819 --> 07:17.788
And how do we know that
you're not making this up?

07:17.856 --> 07:20.990
Because I brought you this.

07:21.058 --> 07:23.292
Atroxium. A nerve gas

07:23.359 --> 07:26.360
that causes extreme
terror in its victims

07:26.428 --> 07:28.795
and, within minutes,
drives them completely insane.

07:28.863 --> 07:33.033
The scientist Wheelwright
who created it wants to meet

07:33.101 --> 07:35.669
Volkoff's must trusted
weapons buyer.

07:35.736 --> 07:39.203
Chuck, I need you to
pose as that buyer.

07:39.271 --> 07:40.537
Atroxium is dangerous,

07:40.538 --> 07:42.438
far too dangerous to
be on the open market.

07:42.439 --> 07:45.506
One warhead of this could
debilitate an entire army.

07:45.574 --> 07:47.006
I had to break cover

07:47.007 --> 07:49.907
so that I could make sure that
the CIA gets hold of this.

07:49.975 --> 07:53.042
Okay, fine. Why me?

07:53.110 --> 07:55.010
Because I thought
I could trust you.

07:56.046 --> 07:57.780
Just say you flashed on him.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.381
Did I...? I'm sorry, what?

07:59.382 --> 08:01.849
You know about the Intersect?
I may not know

08:01.917 --> 08:03.417
anything about you, Chuck,

08:03.418 --> 08:05.318
but I know everything
there is to know

08:05.352 --> 08:07.252
about Charles Carmichael.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.256
We're done here.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.225
Set up the meet.

08:13.292 --> 08:16.561
I'll make sure the CIA
gets the nerve gas.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.996
Good-bye, Chuck.

08:21.032 --> 08:22.932
Good-bye.

08:28.838 --> 08:31.006
Hello.

08:31.073 --> 08:32.273
Welcome to the Buy More.

08:32.274 --> 08:34.174
And be sure to stop by this weekend

08:34.176 --> 08:36.076
and check out our Halloween
haunted house spectacular.

08:36.077 --> 08:38.410
It's going to be scary.
Good scary, though.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.578
Like pumpkins and ghosts.

08:39.578 --> 08:41.647
Not bad scary like war and bears.

08:41.715 --> 08:43.582
You know, 'cause I find...

08:43.582 --> 08:46.085
Oh, good day, sir.
Welcome to the Buy More.

08:46.153 --> 08:48.187
Coming in a little hot today,
aren't you, Grimes?

08:48.255 --> 08:49.521
It's tough.

08:49.522 --> 08:51.656
Once I turn on the charisma,
I can't turn it off.

08:51.724 --> 08:52.857
It's my curse.

08:52.858 --> 08:54.191
Listen-

08:54.192 --> 08:56.726
that little incident in
Iran showed me something.

08:56.794 --> 08:59.729
You're either exceptionally
smart or incredibly stupid.

08:59.797 --> 09:01.797
My father used to say
the exact same thing.

09:01.865 --> 09:02.965
Without the smart part.

09:02.966 --> 09:04.333
But you get it.

09:04.334 --> 09:06.468
The whole situation has
me thinking that maybe...

09:06.536 --> 09:09.037
just maybe, you do have
something to offer as a spy.

09:09.105 --> 09:10.972
This is what I've been
telling you guys. I-I...

09:10.973 --> 09:13.241
Come on. Bartowski has
something to show us.

09:15.277 --> 09:17.477
Thanks.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.880
Sarah, you know I have a
huge blind spot with my mom.

09:22.948 --> 09:26.148
I mean, are we crazy
for doing this?

09:26.216 --> 09:28.183
Should we even be getting involved?

09:29.585 --> 09:31.386
I know that you've been
looking for answers

09:31.387 --> 09:32.987
about your mom for a long time,

09:32.988 --> 09:34.822
and we're going to find some, okay?

09:34.823 --> 09:37.257
We just have to be very cautious.

09:38.292 --> 09:40.159
Thank you.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.661
Just got your message.
What's happening?

09:41.662 --> 09:43.563
Good. You're all here.

09:43.631 --> 09:46.632
Bartowski, your flash on
Wheelwright was 100% correct.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.735
He is currently in Los
Angeles to sell the Atroxium.

09:49.803 --> 09:53.504
I'm sorry. What is
Grimes doing here?

09:53.572 --> 09:55.039
Oh, uh, he's with me, General.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.308
I felt that he could be
of some use to the team.

09:57.376 --> 09:58.576
Is that right?

09:58.577 --> 10:00.310
Yeah. Apparently I'm quite

10:00.311 --> 10:02.145
the hot commodity in the spy world.

10:02.146 --> 10:04.980
Morgan Grimes- not just
for the ladies anymore.

10:05.048 --> 10:07.015
Silence. Of course.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.216
Good. Now we need to focus.

10:09.284 --> 10:11.585
Atroxium is extremely dangerous.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.986
Uh, General, Sarah and I

10:12.987 --> 10:14.420
were discussing a plan.

10:14.421 --> 10:15.488
Um...

10:15.489 --> 10:17.156
if I were to pose as the buyer,

10:17.157 --> 10:18.757
not only would I be
able to get the Atroxium

10:18.758 --> 10:20.992
off the market,
I could also flash on

10:21.060 --> 10:23.294
any Volkoff operatives
that were involved.

10:23.362 --> 10:24.729
So it's a... it's a win-win.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.297
Very impressive, Bartowski.

10:26.298 --> 10:28.198
We'll set up the meet.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.200
Good work, Chuck.

10:31.268 --> 10:33.168
I smell a rat.

10:35.772 --> 10:38.306
I found her- I found my mom.

10:38.373 --> 10:41.108
What?! You found your mom?
That's fantastic, dude.

10:41.175 --> 10:43.309
I'm so happy for you. Thanks.
Thanks so much, man.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.411
I still can't believe it myself.
When? Where?

10:45.479 --> 10:47.480
Well, she actually came to
me with the Wheelwright info.

10:47.548 --> 10:49.382
Chuck, your mother
works for Volkoff.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.083
Which is her cover, Casey.
She's legit.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.285
Better run it by Beckman.
Make sure it checks out.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.221
I've checked, and it's a dead end.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.657
Her CIA credentials were
erased to protect her cover.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.726
We have to keep this
to ourselves. Okay?

10:59.793 --> 11:02.361
If Beckman goes digging,
she could put my mom in danger.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.463
You just have to trust me on this.

11:09.969 --> 11:13.737
Devon, your two little
ladies are home!

11:13.805 --> 11:14.872
Hey, babe...

11:14.873 --> 11:17.942
Little babe.
What are you doing, huh?

11:18.009 --> 11:19.743
We rushed home early
so we could get

11:19.744 --> 11:22.378
a few moments of peace
before your mother gets here

11:22.446 --> 11:25.080
and makes my life
a living... Hello!

11:25.148 --> 11:26.749
...heaven.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.585
It's just a heavenly visit
every time she's here.

11:29.653 --> 11:30.586
Ellie!

11:30.587 --> 11:32.287
Hi, Honey!

11:32.288 --> 11:33.588
It's really good to see you.

11:33.589 --> 11:34.989
What were you doing back there?

11:34.990 --> 11:39.029
Oh, just a little dusting.
We have to keep

11:39.096 --> 11:41.266
this place clean for my
little granddaughter-to-be.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.534
Aw.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.938
So I just thought I'd try

11:45.006 --> 11:47.943
tidying up a bit... as a surprise.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.111
Surprise.

11:49.112 --> 11:51.081
Mom has another
surprise for us, too.

11:51.149 --> 11:53.250
She cancelled the room that
we booked for her at the W.

11:53.317 --> 11:54.918
And she's gonna spending
the whole week with us.

11:54.919 --> 11:56.052
The whole week!

11:56.053 --> 11:58.088
That, that's great!

11:58.155 --> 11:59.322
I know!

11:59.323 --> 12:00.924
I can't believe it either.

12:00.925 --> 12:03.559
Oh, here, darling,
let me take that from you.

12:03.627 --> 12:04.761
Okay.

12:04.762 --> 12:06.329
Are you sure you're okay with this?

12:06.330 --> 12:08.097
Because if not,
I can bite the bullet

12:08.098 --> 12:10.299
and I can ask her to
stay at the hotel.

12:10.367 --> 12:11.800
Uh, no, you don't

12:11.801 --> 12:13.568
have to do that. She should stay.

12:13.569 --> 12:14.735
You sure? Yeah.

12:14.736 --> 12:17.435
Yeah. I felt the baby
kick on the way home.

12:17.503 --> 12:18.836
Oh, my God, really?

12:18.837 --> 12:21.672
Yeah. It's starting to
feel so real, you know?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.006
I'm gonna be a mom.

12:23.007 --> 12:24.305
I don't know how to be a mom.

12:24.306 --> 12:25.806
Of course you do.

12:25.807 --> 12:29.609
You know, your mother and I
aren't best friends, but it

12:29.677 --> 12:31.377
might be nice to have her around.

12:31.378 --> 12:33.278
You know, I could use a
little motherly advice.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.247
I'll go make up the guest room.

12:35.315 --> 12:36.382
Okay.

12:36.383 --> 12:38.885
Mmm.

12:40.253 --> 12:42.153
I could stay at the W.

12:46.692 --> 12:48.393
You wanted to see me, boss?

12:48.394 --> 12:50.929
One second, buddy.

12:56.969 --> 12:58.136
Everything okay?

12:58.137 --> 13:02.106
Just a bit overwhelmed
right now, you know?

13:02.173 --> 13:03.640
Work stuff, and,
uh... I promised Chuck

13:03.641 --> 13:05.374
that I would help him
with something...

13:05.375 --> 13:07.076
Can I ask you a question?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.744
How do you do it? How do you

13:08.745 --> 13:11.012
balance the Buy More and your
regular life? 'Cause I...

13:11.080 --> 13:13.114
Son, in my 12-and-a-half weeks

13:13.182 --> 13:14.983
at the El Segundo
School of Finance,

13:14.984 --> 13:17.652
I learned one very
important word: Hmm?

13:17.719 --> 13:18.820
"delegate."

13:18.821 --> 13:20.055
That word is the key

13:20.056 --> 13:21.224
to being a successful manager.

13:21.225 --> 13:22.759
There's even a catchy
phrase for when

13:22.760 --> 13:24.827
you got too much to do:

13:24.895 --> 13:27.129
"Get it off your plate,
give it to other people."

13:27.197 --> 13:29.031
I think what you mean to say is:

13:29.032 --> 13:30.598
"Get it off your plate, delegate."

13:30.599 --> 13:31.866
No, I do not.

13:31.867 --> 13:35.202
You are not a rhyming monkey,
you are a manager.

13:35.270 --> 13:37.170
You're right. Of course,
you're absolutely right.

13:37.205 --> 13:39.706
And thank you for the offer.
I would love for you

13:39.774 --> 13:42.075
to dress the Buy
More for Halloween.

13:42.142 --> 13:44.344
No, no, I do not
have time for that.

13:44.411 --> 13:47.013
I am knee-deep in this new
Danielle Steele novel.

13:47.080 --> 13:50.415
Anyway, Big Mike isn't
nearly scary enough

13:50.483 --> 13:52.050
to build a haunted house.

13:52.051 --> 13:55.519
And you need to put some
real crazies on that...

14:07.264 --> 14:09.164
...if you want it done correctly.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.541
Good afternoon, Mr. Carmichael.

14:21.576 --> 14:23.476
I'll show you to your table.

14:23.478 --> 14:25.879
That would be perfect, thank you.

14:25.947 --> 14:28.181
We just got word that
Wheelwright is en route.

14:28.249 --> 14:29.482
Remember, cool, calm and collected.

14:29.483 --> 14:31.751
You are Volkoff's
top weapons buyer.

14:31.819 --> 14:35.221
Just one question:
can we get one of those

14:35.289 --> 14:37.290
hostess outfits for back home?

14:37.357 --> 14:38.624
Focus, Bartowski.

14:38.625 --> 14:40.459
The grownups are
trying to work here.

14:40.460 --> 14:41.793
So sorry I'm late.

14:41.794 --> 14:43.328
You weren't here already?

14:43.329 --> 14:44.395
Ha-ha. Nice.

14:44.396 --> 14:45.896
I love our little give-and-take.

14:45.897 --> 14:47.197
Classic Ross and Rachel.

14:47.198 --> 14:48.732
Okay, what can I do to help?

14:48.733 --> 14:49.933
Grimes? Yeah?

14:49.934 --> 14:51.901
A good spy is trained
in the art of silence.

14:51.969 --> 14:53.869
Silence. Got it.

14:55.472 --> 14:58.341
Chuck, don't fill up on bread.
You're gonna ruin your appetite.

14:59.509 --> 15:01.777
Sorry. Don't...

15:06.314 --> 15:07.615
Target is approaching.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.516
Give the signal.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.554
Uh... Mr. Carmichael?

15:15.622 --> 15:18.257
Please, sit.
Make yourself comfortable.

15:22.329 --> 15:25.298
So, um...

15:25.365 --> 15:27.265
do we talk price?

15:32.004 --> 15:34.271
Dr. Wheelwright, relax.

15:34.339 --> 15:35.372
I'm about to make you

15:35.373 --> 15:37.507
a very, very rich man.

15:40.576 --> 15:42.877
Would you care for a
drink to calm the nerves?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.181
Toasting already?

15:52.218 --> 15:53.718
What's going on there, Walker?

15:53.719 --> 15:55.520
That's Chuck's mother.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.421
What's she doing there?

15:57.722 --> 15:59.756
You must be Mr. Carmichael.

16:01.258 --> 16:04.560
Chuck, remember, keep your
cover and make the deal.

16:06.396 --> 16:10.466
I am Mr. Carmichael.
And who might you be?

16:10.534 --> 16:11.901
I work for Volkoff.

16:11.902 --> 16:14.269
It's my job to ensure
a smooth transaction.

16:14.337 --> 16:16.005
Smooth? Smooth? Is that right?

16:16.006 --> 16:18.075
Well, this transaction
couldn't be going smoother.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.312
It is chock full of smoothness.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.080
Yes, the transaction

16:22.081 --> 16:23.782
was progressing just fine.

16:23.783 --> 16:27.453
Well, it may appear that way,
but sometimes appearances

16:27.520 --> 16:29.287
don't tell the whole story.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.823
I've done some digging on

16:31.891 --> 16:35.326
Mr. Carmichael here,
and unfortunately

16:35.394 --> 16:37.661
his story doesn't check out.

16:37.729 --> 16:40.597
It's a CIA trap. He's a spy.

16:40.665 --> 16:42.565
What?

16:46.903 --> 16:48.803
Man down! Man down! Walker,
get in there!

16:55.143 --> 16:56.943
Whoa! Holy...!

16:56.944 --> 16:58.844
Chuck, you okay? Chuck?

17:02.713 --> 17:04.613
Chuck!

17:17.156 --> 17:18.723
Chuck, are you okay?

17:18.724 --> 17:20.625
Sarah...

17:24.297 --> 17:26.698
My mom shot me.

17:34.363 --> 17:36.697
My heart hurts. I know.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.665
I can't believe your mom
betrayed you like that.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.766
No, no, my heart actually hurts.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.500
She shot me in the heart area.

17:42.501 --> 17:43.668
Oh, okay. Here.

17:43.669 --> 17:45.569
Thank you.

17:46.405 --> 17:50.440
Ah! Oh, I'm such an idiot, Sarah.

17:50.508 --> 17:52.809
After everything I
knew about my mom,

17:52.876 --> 17:54.143
everything I learned about my mom,

17:54.144 --> 17:55.611
I still trusted her anyway.

17:55.612 --> 17:57.212
That's really great spy work.

17:57.213 --> 17:59.181
You know, Chuck, even in

17:59.248 --> 18:02.150
the spy world where everything

18:02.218 --> 18:03.850
is run by deceit,

18:03.851 --> 18:05.851
you still manage to somehow
genuinely trust people.

18:05.919 --> 18:06.952
You know what?

18:06.953 --> 18:09.721
That's what I love about you.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.556
That's what you love about me?

18:11.557 --> 18:13.124
Not my dashing good looks

18:13.125 --> 18:15.393
or the giant computer in my brain?

18:15.460 --> 18:18.662
And you're funny, even if your
mom has shot you in the heart.

18:20.431 --> 18:22.699
Oh, two fugitives and a
dangerous weapon on the loose.

18:22.766 --> 18:23.800
Go, team.

18:23.801 --> 18:25.134
Well, you know, we could

18:25.135 --> 18:26.402
go back to the restaurant,

18:26.403 --> 18:28.036
see if they left any clues behind.

18:28.037 --> 18:29.237
No, no.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.271
We got this.

18:30.272 --> 18:32.405
Dude, you just got
shot by your mom, okay?

18:32.473 --> 18:33.740
Take a break.

18:33.741 --> 18:35.041
Have a little Chuck time.

18:35.042 --> 18:37.712
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe I should.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.415
Sorry.

18:39.416 --> 18:41.316
Spy work or the Buy More?

18:42.318 --> 18:44.218
Nah.

18:46.622 --> 18:47.989
I don't know. What about there?

18:47.990 --> 18:50.391
And then it could come
swinging and screaming

18:50.459 --> 18:51.859
at everybody. Oh, Morgo, hey.

18:51.860 --> 18:54.427
Um, listen, we have a few questions

18:54.495 --> 18:56.829
regarding these
Halloween decorations.

18:56.897 --> 18:59.064
Um, what are we allowed to show?

18:59.132 --> 19:00.799
What do you mean?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.501
I know a really good
morgue that gives

19:02.502 --> 19:04.103
discounts on unclaimed merchandise.

19:04.104 --> 19:05.338
Maybe we could

19:05.339 --> 19:06.939
sprinkle some cold,
dead ones in here.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.108
Right. No, I'm gonna say
no on the dead bodies.

19:09.176 --> 19:11.044
So, what, I just lose my deposit?

19:11.045 --> 19:12.613
Shh... Okay, look,

19:12.614 --> 19:14.882
here's the thing: I put you in
charge of decorating the store

19:14.950 --> 19:17.384
so I can get it off my plate,
so you're just gonna have

19:17.452 --> 19:19.554
to figure it out for me,
okay? Make it big, make it fun.

19:19.622 --> 19:21.556
But most importantly,
let's make it scary,

19:21.624 --> 19:23.592
okay?

19:25.929 --> 19:29.198
Morgan's right. We gotta
tap into a place that is

19:29.266 --> 19:32.699
so scary, so demented,

19:32.767 --> 19:35.800
that it'll change
Halloween as we know it.

19:35.868 --> 19:37.768
We gotta tap...

19:39.671 --> 19:42.539
...into your head!

19:42.607 --> 19:43.773
Okay.

19:43.774 --> 19:47.310
Yeah, you gotta start
using conditioner.

19:47.377 --> 19:49.312
Your hair feels like hay.

19:58.453 --> 20:00.353
Get in. Are you crazy?

20:00.388 --> 20:02.155
You know, I didn't
think you could top

20:02.156 --> 20:04.590
abandoning me for
the last 20 years,

20:04.658 --> 20:06.158
and then you shot me!

20:06.159 --> 20:11.864
And I will do it again,
if you don't get in this car right now.

20:17.203 --> 20:18.502
That's every bus station,

20:18.503 --> 20:20.371
subway platform and
traffic light camera

20:20.372 --> 20:21.905
within a mile radius
of the restaurant.

20:21.906 --> 20:24.040
We have no lead on where
Wheelwright and Chuck's mom

20:24.108 --> 20:25.308
fled to after the shooting.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.479
Come on. What rock are
you two hiding under?

20:31.083 --> 20:33.381
Chuck just activated
his tracking device.

20:45.959 --> 20:48.127
Mom, you hit one pothole

20:48.195 --> 20:50.696
and this ride gets
very messy very quick.

20:50.763 --> 20:55.300
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have to keep up appearances.

20:55.368 --> 20:57.336
Oh. Oh, is that all?

20:57.403 --> 20:59.471
What the heck is
going on here, okay?

20:59.539 --> 21:01.372
This is crazy.

21:01.373 --> 21:03.775
Chuck, when I left you and Ellie,
I was embedded

21:03.842 --> 21:05.710
into a secret operation

21:05.711 --> 21:08.280
called Project Isis.
My mission was to destroy

21:08.347 --> 21:10.115
the Volkoff Organization
from within.

21:10.116 --> 21:12.484
But I got in way too deep.

21:12.551 --> 21:13.852
And I was forced to close

21:13.853 --> 21:15.820
the door on my old life.

21:15.888 --> 21:17.622
But then you came looking for me.

21:17.623 --> 21:19.424
And that set off the alarm bells.

21:19.425 --> 21:23.194
Right. So you shot me?

21:23.262 --> 21:25.063
I knew that you
were wearing a vest.

21:25.064 --> 21:28.966
Volkoff was tapped into the
security footage of the cafe,

21:29.034 --> 21:31.235
so he thinks that Charles
Carmichael is dead.

21:31.303 --> 21:33.737
And that means you
and Ellie are safe.

21:35.607 --> 21:38.041
You did this to
protect me and Ellie?

21:38.109 --> 21:42.347
Chuck, you and your sister are

21:42.415 --> 21:44.783
and always have been
my only concern.

21:47.787 --> 21:50.056
Not being in your
lives has pained me

21:50.124 --> 21:51.892
more than you could ever imagine.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.762
But you had a mission.

22:04.042 --> 22:06.910
I constantly relive that day
when I walked out the door.

22:06.978 --> 22:08.145
Over and over.

22:08.146 --> 22:09.779
And I want you to know that

22:09.780 --> 22:14.050
if I could do it over again,
I never would have left.

22:15.586 --> 22:18.120
I would still be there,
with my family.

22:18.188 --> 22:21.023
But that's all in the past.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.625
So come with me.

22:23.693 --> 22:27.062
'Cause I never got you a present
for your tenth birthday.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.664
Come on.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.533
Come on.

22:39.303 --> 22:42.137
See, I knew that if I shot you,
Wheelwright might panic

22:42.205 --> 22:45.540
and try to unload the
weapon on his own.

22:45.607 --> 22:48.275
But Atroxium is far too dangerous,

22:48.343 --> 22:52.144
so I just went ahead
and handled it.

22:52.212 --> 22:54.580
Handle-Handle- How did
you handle it, exactly?

22:58.917 --> 23:00.484
This is Wheelwright's mobile lab.

23:00.485 --> 23:01.986
He's tranq'd up inside,

23:01.987 --> 23:04.088
and the Atroxium's
ready for extraction.

23:04.155 --> 23:06.156
And, Chuck,

23:06.224 --> 23:07.557
sorry I shot you.

23:07.558 --> 23:09.458
Hey, it's okay.

23:09.493 --> 23:11.393
No harm, no foul.

23:11.628 --> 23:13.195
Oh, God.

23:13.196 --> 23:14.296
Mom...

23:14.297 --> 23:15.631
I know.

23:15.632 --> 23:18.767
You activated your tracking
device when you got in the car.

23:18.835 --> 23:20.735
Good boy.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.382
Okay, come on, Chuck's signal
is coming from in there.

23:33.451 --> 23:35.351
Agents will be here any second.

23:35.352 --> 23:37.787
You're going to vanish
for good now, aren't you?

23:37.854 --> 23:39.822
I did what I came here to do.

23:39.890 --> 23:41.490
And now you and Ellie are safe,

23:41.491 --> 23:43.459
and I've got to go back undercover.

23:43.526 --> 23:44.893
Okay, okay, fine.

23:44.894 --> 23:47.195
But, listen, before
you disappear, please,

23:47.263 --> 23:49.631
go and talk to Ellie,
just for a second.

23:49.698 --> 23:51.599
Just-Just tell her what you
told me about why you left us.

23:51.667 --> 23:54.536
200 meters.

23:56.439 --> 23:58.339
I'm sorry.

23:59.209 --> 24:01.109
I'm sorry, Chuck.

24:05.582 --> 24:07.850
Mom, Ellie's pregnant.

24:07.918 --> 24:10.320
She's pregnant,

24:10.388 --> 24:12.422
and you're going to
be a grandmother.

24:18.362 --> 24:20.262
We're getting closer. 80 meters.

24:44.457 --> 24:46.357
Chuck, how'd you get here?

24:47.893 --> 24:50.895
My mom dropped me off.

24:59.050 --> 25:01.018
Well, she may be a bad mom,

25:01.086 --> 25:03.553
but she makes a great spy, right?

25:03.621 --> 25:05.353
Either way,

25:05.354 --> 25:06.354
I guess it doesn't matter.

25:06.355 --> 25:07.655
She's gone.

25:07.656 --> 25:09.023
You okay?

25:09.024 --> 25:10.357
Yeah.

25:10.358 --> 25:12.626
I... I'm just wondering
what to tell my sister.

25:12.694 --> 25:14.428
I mean, do I casually drop that

25:14.429 --> 25:16.630
Mom came back to town
to shoot me in the chest

25:16.698 --> 25:18.465
and hand over a deadly
chemical weapon?

25:18.466 --> 25:20.033
Well, I know that you'll figure out

25:20.034 --> 25:21.934
the exact right thing to say.

25:26.006 --> 25:29.608
Lucky for me, I know
the foremost authority

25:29.676 --> 25:31.376
on all things Ellie Bartowski.

25:31.377 --> 25:32.810
I'm gonna be right back.

25:32.811 --> 25:34.011
You save some of that fun for me.

25:34.012 --> 25:35.912
I will.

25:37.881 --> 25:40.082
I don't trust her.
If Bartowski's mom's

25:40.150 --> 25:42.285
working for the good guys,
then why disappear?

25:42.352 --> 25:43.486
I don't know.

25:43.487 --> 25:44.854
But Chuck believes her.

25:44.855 --> 25:46.355
Yeah.

25:46.356 --> 25:48.323
I know a decommissioned
NSA agent, specializes

25:48.391 --> 25:50.158
in expunged documents.

25:50.159 --> 25:51.826
Unsavory character,
but I think he can

25:51.827 --> 25:53.361
get us what we need.

25:53.362 --> 25:55.262
You want backup?

25:56.331 --> 25:57.431
No.

25:57.432 --> 25:58.432
I got someone.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.499
<i>I knew it.</i>

25:59.500 --> 26:01.233
I knew Mrs. B wasn't a bad guy.

26:01.234 --> 26:03.201
You know why? Bad guys don't
make such delicious lemon bars.

26:03.269 --> 26:04.302
Killer brownies, too.

26:04.303 --> 26:06.304
Look, I need your
advice for this Mor-

26:06.371 --> 26:07.872
Hey, ah!

26:07.873 --> 26:09.773
Oh! Oh!

26:10.475 --> 26:12.609
What the...?

26:21.719 --> 26:23.019
Wow. They did it.

26:23.020 --> 26:24.453
Jeff and Lester pulled it off, man.

26:24.454 --> 26:25.554
This looks great.

26:25.555 --> 26:27.589
Guys, hey, excellent work

26:27.657 --> 26:28.990
with the Halloween decorations.

26:28.991 --> 26:30.024
The store looks incredible.

26:30.025 --> 26:32.626
This garbage? No, no, no.

26:32.694 --> 26:36.396
This is just to whet your
appetite for the main event.

26:36.463 --> 26:38.898
Gentlemen, prepare yourselves

26:38.965 --> 26:42.401
for the Aisle of Terror.

26:44.905 --> 26:49.140
Prepare... to be terrorized!

26:49.208 --> 26:51.142
Fernando, not now! I mean...

26:56.716 --> 27:00.186
We got the idea from an experiment

27:00.253 --> 27:02.588
that the UCLA psychology
department did

27:02.656 --> 27:03.890
on our friend Jeffrey.

27:03.891 --> 27:06.292
Nothing I won't do for
$30 and a sandwich.

27:06.359 --> 27:07.826
Um...

27:07.827 --> 27:09.694
Or just a sandwich.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.096
You see, there's this
world-renowned professor

27:11.097 --> 27:13.264
at UCLA, Professor Schofield,

27:13.332 --> 27:16.167
who specializes in
examining the subconscious

27:16.235 --> 27:17.502
of the mentally disturbed.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.770
He gets right up in there.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.671
Shh! So using Jeffrey
and a bunch of other

27:20.706 --> 27:24.209
nut bags as test cases,
he discovered that there are

27:24.276 --> 27:26.176
certain images

27:26.178 --> 27:29.347
that can cause terror
in even the most...

27:29.415 --> 27:31.983
fearless lunatics.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.951
Let's do this.

27:34.085 --> 27:37.154
So now...

27:37.222 --> 27:39.290
get ready to see some of

27:39.358 --> 27:42.427
the scariest things in the world.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.131
Old people.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.471
Public showers.

27:51.472 --> 27:53.372
What's going on, Chuck?

27:53.607 --> 27:55.575
Interspecies relationships.

27:55.643 --> 27:57.278
Okay.

27:57.279 --> 27:58.813
What- Stop now, stop.

27:58.814 --> 28:00.448
Uh, I'll be honest with you.

28:00.449 --> 28:04.553
This might be one of the
worst things I've ever seen.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.121
One of the best things?

28:06.122 --> 28:07.956
I think he said "best." Yeah.

28:07.957 --> 28:09.324
I don't want any customers in here.

28:09.325 --> 28:11.259
Guys, it's scary, but just

28:11.327 --> 28:12.494
in a really bad way.

28:12.495 --> 28:14.430
I give up. I give up.

28:18.168 --> 28:20.703
Babies in costume.

28:20.771 --> 28:22.204
Really?

28:22.205 --> 28:26.070
Is it a baby... or is it a snail?

28:26.138 --> 28:28.272
I don't know.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.240
'Kay.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.951
So, Honey, you have
any parenting tips?

28:40.018 --> 28:41.686
I mean, Devon turned out so good,

28:41.687 --> 28:43.954
I just figured you could
give me some inside scoop.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.756
Well, you know, Devon was
amazing right from the start.

28:46.824 --> 28:48.891
Really great genes, I guess.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.358
I guess.

28:50.359 --> 28:52.593
But don't you worry,
this little wonder

28:52.661 --> 28:54.561
is already halfway there.

28:55.896 --> 28:58.130
You know, we really
have to make sure

28:58.198 --> 29:02.333
that this baby has
positive female influences.

29:02.401 --> 29:05.070
So I'm here to help.

29:05.138 --> 29:08.173
Thanks, Honey.

29:08.241 --> 29:10.041
Babe, is this not the most
adorable thing you've ever seen?

29:10.042 --> 29:11.209
It's adorable.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.110
Plays the "Chicken Dance."

29:14.246 --> 29:16.813
Devon, like this stuffed bear
is going to teach this baby

29:16.881 --> 29:18.781
how to read and write.

29:19.984 --> 29:22.685
Here.

29:22.753 --> 29:24.653
Babies love dictionaries.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.023
I'm gonna see if they have

29:27.024 --> 29:29.459
an encyclopedia.

29:30.661 --> 29:32.027
You okay, hon?

29:32.028 --> 29:33.928
I'm fine.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.966
Your, uh, your mother
might be a bit much,

29:38.034 --> 29:39.568
but underneath it all,
she just wants to be

29:39.569 --> 29:40.669
a part of the baby's life.

29:40.670 --> 29:43.372
It's more than I
can say for my mom.

30:05.494 --> 30:07.661
<i>I've been thinking about my mom.</i>

30:09.731 --> 30:11.098
It's weird, though.

30:11.099 --> 30:12.600
The woman that I
found is nothing like

30:12.601 --> 30:13.901
the one I remember
from my childhood.

30:13.902 --> 30:15.902
You're trying to justify
not telling Ellie?

30:15.970 --> 30:17.904
Am I that transparent?

30:17.972 --> 30:19.839
No.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.008
But you don't want to hurt her.

30:24.578 --> 30:27.747
Okay, let's get started
on the detonator.

30:30.084 --> 30:32.852
That's not good.

30:35.089 --> 30:36.890
Wheelwright.

30:36.891 --> 30:38.791
Quick, quick.

30:39.293 --> 30:41.261
Why is the device counting down?

30:41.329 --> 30:42.929
Oh, that?

30:42.930 --> 30:45.832
Well, just a safety measure
to protect against tampering.

30:45.899 --> 30:47.567
It counts down until I verify

30:47.568 --> 30:49.335
that the weapon is
in my possession.

30:49.336 --> 30:51.003
Okay, tell us how to turn it off.

30:51.004 --> 30:52.671
Well, you'll need this.

30:52.672 --> 30:55.139
But why should I help you?

30:56.808 --> 31:01.143
Remember, if the device goes off,
you'll be exposed.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.279
So be a good boy and turn it off.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.147
Well played.

31:06.148 --> 31:07.749
Get out.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.650
Come on.

31:18.791 --> 31:21.459
There. I deactivated
the safety check.

31:21.526 --> 31:22.927
It shouldn't bother you again.

31:22.928 --> 31:24.127
Okay, good.

31:24.128 --> 31:25.729
I'll get the handcuffs.

31:25.730 --> 31:28.197
Keep him close while we
continue to work on this.

31:28.265 --> 31:29.332
Yeah, hurry up.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.934
Here, you, sit.

31:40.276 --> 31:42.176
Aah! What have you done?

31:48.731 --> 31:50.631
Sarah, get back!

31:52.102 --> 31:53.402
Chuck, no!

31:53.403 --> 31:55.303
Chuck!

31:56.439 --> 31:58.339
Your hands are shaking.

31:59.274 --> 32:01.174
That's how it begins.

32:01.877 --> 32:03.911
You exposed both of us?

32:03.979 --> 32:05.279
Why?

32:05.280 --> 32:06.546
Why would you do that?

32:06.547 --> 32:08.715
Well, I developed this nerve gas

32:08.782 --> 32:10.850
by testing it on myself.

32:10.918 --> 32:14.419
It was a long, terrifying process,

32:14.487 --> 32:16.354
but after a while, I gave in.

32:16.355 --> 32:17.522
I surrendered

32:17.523 --> 32:19.090
to my insanity.

32:19.091 --> 32:22.294
And now I'm not scared
of anything. So...

32:24.599 --> 32:28.670
What scares you, Chuck, hmm?

32:31.774 --> 32:32.841
Everything! Everything!

32:32.842 --> 32:36.644
Everything! Almost...
Almost everything!

32:36.712 --> 32:38.346
Make it stop. Make it stop.
Somebody turn it off.

32:38.347 --> 32:40.048
Turn it off. Chuck, listen to me,

32:40.049 --> 32:41.849
it's all in your head.
You need to fight it.

32:41.850 --> 32:43.952
I'm trying, but it's horrible.

32:44.019 --> 32:46.154
This is exactly why I
don't see scary movies,

32:46.221 --> 32:48.923
and I stick mainly
to the PG-13 region.

32:48.990 --> 32:50.890
Let's go.

32:53.228 --> 32:56.097
Come on.

32:56.164 --> 32:57.832
If you get me out of here,

32:57.833 --> 32:59.967
I will consider taking you

33:00.034 --> 33:01.802
to the antitoxin.

33:01.803 --> 33:05.138
Anything. Anything you want.

33:10.977 --> 33:14.913
Now I'm going to kill that bitch
Frost who double-crossed me.

33:14.981 --> 33:16.981
No, no, I can't let that happen.

33:20.352 --> 33:22.787
Did you just lock us in here?

33:22.855 --> 33:25.556
Oops.

33:25.624 --> 33:27.791
Oh... look who's the comedian now.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.980
Chuck!

33:49.250 --> 33:51.150
Sarah?

33:59.663 --> 34:00.896
It's getting worse.

34:00.897 --> 34:03.298
These are your deepest fears.

34:03.365 --> 34:05.232
No, please make it stop!

34:05.233 --> 34:06.233
There's no escape.

34:06.234 --> 34:08.469
We're both locked in here.

34:08.536 --> 34:10.436
No!

34:18.446 --> 34:20.346
Come on, Casey, pick up.

34:21.650 --> 34:23.817
Okay.

34:23.884 --> 34:25.351
Our informant should be here soon

34:25.351 --> 34:27.252
to give us an update
on Project Isis.

34:27.288 --> 34:29.522
This is so cool. "Our informant,
" that is so cloak-and-dagger.

34:29.590 --> 34:31.091
I love it.

34:31.092 --> 34:33.493
What does that make me-
the inside man? The mole?

34:33.560 --> 34:35.226
You're the magnet.

34:35.228 --> 34:37.630
The magnet. I love that. Yeah!

34:37.697 --> 34:39.632
Spies have the coolest names.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.567
Okay, what do you need

34:41.568 --> 34:43.369
the magnet to do?

34:43.370 --> 34:45.103
You already look like a spy.

34:45.103 --> 34:47.873
Now all I need you to do
is stand here by the Vic

34:47.940 --> 34:49.107
and act like one.

34:49.108 --> 34:51.007
Yeah?

34:53.879 --> 34:56.547
Done.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.484
How was that?

34:59.485 --> 35:02.554
Wonderful.

35:05.958 --> 35:07.125
Boo!

35:07.126 --> 35:08.226
Found you.

35:08.227 --> 35:09.794
Oh, look.

35:09.795 --> 35:11.730
Aisle of Terror.

35:11.797 --> 35:13.697
An unfortunate place
for you to be trapped.

35:19.405 --> 35:22.139
Now do you feel like
getting us out of here?

35:23.842 --> 35:25.843
Aisle of Terror...

35:25.911 --> 35:28.579
Images that can cause terror
in even the most... fearless...

35:28.647 --> 35:30.547
<i>lunatics...</i>

35:32.484 --> 35:35.354
What the hell is this?

35:35.421 --> 35:37.089
Public showers?

35:37.090 --> 35:38.457
That's peculiar.

35:38.458 --> 35:40.859
Reminds me of Professor
Schofield's work.

35:40.927 --> 35:42.293
That hack.

35:42.294 --> 35:44.330
Thought he knew about fear.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.700
A baby in a snail costume.

35:48.701 --> 35:51.365
It... it is Schofield's work.

35:51.433 --> 35:53.333
That's crazy.

35:56.971 --> 35:59.206
Is it a baby...

35:59.273 --> 36:02.041
or a snail?

36:06.613 --> 36:08.513
Old people.

36:08.547 --> 36:11.615
Oh, get it out of my head!

36:11.682 --> 36:14.417
Interspecies relations.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.987
The terror- the terror. It's...

36:17.988 --> 36:19.822
It's all flooding back now.

36:19.823 --> 36:21.723
Black licorice!

36:21.791 --> 36:23.458
Please, please make it stop!

36:23.459 --> 36:25.359
Man feet!

36:25.895 --> 36:27.462
Otters!

36:27.463 --> 36:30.631
This can't be happening.

36:31.666 --> 36:34.301
Schofield!

36:37.905 --> 36:39.205
Chuck.

36:39.206 --> 36:40.706
No... Chuck, are you okay?
What happened?

36:40.707 --> 36:42.007
Sarah, I don't want to-

36:42.008 --> 36:43.875
I... I don't want to
see you like this,

36:43.876 --> 36:46.478
so I'm just going to keep my eyes
closed until we get the antidote.

36:46.546 --> 36:47.546
Okay? Okay, okay.

36:47.547 --> 36:48.547
Okay, okay, bye.

36:48.548 --> 36:50.148
Let's get up. Come on.

36:50.149 --> 36:52.049
Oh, God!

37:08.164 --> 37:10.064
Give me your gun.

37:10.934 --> 37:13.069
No, but it's not a real gun.

37:13.136 --> 37:14.503
It's-it's just a

37:14.504 --> 37:16.005
heavily-modified

37:16.006 --> 37:17.406
paint ball pistol.

37:17.407 --> 37:19.242
Which I know paint ball's still very,
very dangerous,

37:19.243 --> 37:20.977
but what I'm trying
to explain is that

37:20.978 --> 37:22.745
it's not real...

37:22.746 --> 37:24.614
I'll take that folder.

37:24.615 --> 37:26.383
Casey, Casey, what is going on?

37:26.384 --> 37:28.752
Why is there a gun to my head?

37:28.820 --> 37:30.621
I'm the magnet.

37:30.622 --> 37:33.057
I'm the magnet for bad guys?

37:33.125 --> 37:34.759
Are you kidding me?

37:34.760 --> 37:36.660
Come on, man.

37:36.695 --> 37:38.329
I can't believe you.

37:38.330 --> 37:40.098
I cannot believe that
you would bring me here

37:40.099 --> 37:41.866
and use me as a human target.
What nerve.

37:41.867 --> 37:43.767
Grimes... No, no, no,
I need to finish.

37:43.802 --> 37:45.469
And this may sting,
but you need to hear it.

37:45.470 --> 37:46.937
You, sir,

37:46.938 --> 37:48.606
are not very thoughtful.
Not one bit.

37:48.607 --> 37:49.941
I mean, am I alone here?

37:49.942 --> 37:51.310
Well... yeah.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.811
What, are you agreeing with him?

37:52.812 --> 37:54.045
Whose side are you on?

37:54.046 --> 37:55.180
Can I go?

37:55.181 --> 37:56.314
Yeah, run along.

37:56.315 --> 37:59.417
Oh, not cool, man.

37:59.484 --> 38:01.619
That is just not cool.
You did good, Grimes.

38:01.687 --> 38:03.121
Really? Thank you.

38:03.122 --> 38:04.322
I tried to really kind

38:04.323 --> 38:05.790
of sink into the role,
you know, and...

38:05.791 --> 38:06.858
Huh.

38:06.859 --> 38:09.361
Oh, I know that "huh."

38:09.428 --> 38:10.562
Why- what does it say?

38:10.563 --> 38:12.129
Chuck's mom's story checks out.

38:12.130 --> 38:14.030
She's totally clean.

38:14.532 --> 38:16.332
Perfect.

38:16.333 --> 38:18.968
Oh, that was not a fun trip.

38:19.036 --> 38:21.872
Well, thank God we got Wheelwright
to give up that antitoxin

38:21.940 --> 38:24.408
before he went completely
off the reservation.

38:24.476 --> 38:25.843
Thank you, Sarah.

38:25.844 --> 38:27.744
You're the greatest partner ever.

38:37.924 --> 38:39.191
Oh, my God.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.992
What?

38:40.993 --> 38:42.662
My mom- she left a message.

38:42.663 --> 38:45.298
She wants to see Ellie tonight
before she goes back undercover.

38:49.069 --> 38:51.270
I honestly thought Ellie
would never see my mom again.

38:51.337 --> 38:52.671
Uh, I'll come with you.

38:52.672 --> 38:55.073
No, no, no. Hey, I-I
appreciate your concern, Sarah,

38:55.140 --> 38:57.040
but trust me, it's my mom.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.492
Hi, sis.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.529
Brushing up on your vocab, huh?

39:25.566 --> 39:28.835
I was just trying to get away
from Honey for a few minutes.

39:30.838 --> 39:32.572
It's ironic, isn't it?

39:32.573 --> 39:34.473
The mother that I
wish would disappear

39:34.475 --> 39:37.410
is here to answer
all of my questions.

39:37.478 --> 39:39.914
And the mother that I
wish I could talk to

39:39.981 --> 39:43.150
has disappeared forever.

39:47.622 --> 39:51.024
Hey, Ellie, you,
uh- you got plans tonight?

40:04.839 --> 40:07.374
What's with all the secrecy?

40:07.442 --> 40:08.976
I needed to get away from Castle,

40:08.977 --> 40:10.511
in case Grimes was hanging around.

40:10.512 --> 40:13.381
If he knew the truth,
he'd go running to his BFF.

40:14.983 --> 40:17.885
Everything about Bartowski's
mother's life is a fake.

40:17.953 --> 40:19.319
Project Isis-

40:19.320 --> 40:21.955
it ended 20 years ago
when Frost went rogue.

40:23.691 --> 40:25.092
So what, she's a double agent?

40:25.093 --> 40:26.993
She's working directly for Volkoff?

40:27.829 --> 40:29.330
I should have grabbed her

40:29.331 --> 40:31.231
before she dropped
off the map again.

40:33.302 --> 40:35.236
What?

40:35.304 --> 40:37.672
What is it, Walker?

40:39.441 --> 40:42.343
So what do we do when she
walks through the door?

40:42.411 --> 40:45.280
I mean, part of me
wants to be reserved-

40:45.348 --> 40:46.848
show her that I'm an adult

40:46.849 --> 40:49.117
and I've been just
fine since she left.

40:49.185 --> 40:53.554
The other part of me
just wants to hug her.

40:53.622 --> 40:56.322
Do whatever feels right.

40:58.157 --> 40:59.557
I'm gonna go take a look outside.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.458
She might have got lost. Okay.

41:07.735 --> 41:09.635
Chuck.

41:15.743 --> 41:18.711
Mom... No!

41:21.549 --> 41:22.582
Chuck!

41:22.583 --> 41:23.716
Stop!

41:23.717 --> 41:24.884
No! No!

41:24.885 --> 41:26.185
Let her go!

41:26.186 --> 41:28.520
Stop! Stop! You have no
idea what's going on!

41:28.588 --> 41:31.122
Your mom isn't the spy
you think she is. Sarah?

41:32.858 --> 41:34.758
I'm protecting your blind spot.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.094
Sarah!

41:53.278 --> 41:56.347
Chuck, what is it?

41:59.251 --> 42:01.985
Ellie, I'm sorry,
but Mom is not coming.

42:03.888 --> 42:06.824
Why does she keep doing this to us?

42:10.161 --> 42:12.061
Because she's a spy.
