48:39.568 --> 48:42.310
Woman: Cut!
Nice work, everybody.

48:42.354 --> 48:44.051
We wanted to hold off
that he was talking to June

48:44.095 --> 48:46.358
because we didn't want to reveal
that he was dealing

48:46.401 --> 48:48.142
with some sort of medical issue

48:48.186 --> 48:50.710
and June is
the closest thing any

48:50.753 --> 48:52.930
of these characters has
to a doctor.

48:52.973 --> 48:54.018
We're going to get
to the bottom

48:54.061 --> 48:56.716
of whatever's going on,
okay?

48:56.759 --> 48:58.065
I promise you that.

48:58.109 --> 48:59.980
It was really
about her being able

49:00.024 --> 49:04.289
to help Daniel understand
what's going on in his head

49:04.332 --> 49:06.030
and understand why, now,

49:06.073 --> 49:07.814
he's having
these memory problems

49:07.857 --> 49:11.818
and why a man who spent
his entire life lying to get by,

49:11.861 --> 49:15.648
lying to survive,
is now unable to trust himself

49:15.691 --> 49:17.780
and feels like
he's lying to himself.

49:17.824 --> 49:21.436
[Tearfully]
I'll find a place.

49:21.480 --> 49:23.308
Come to Lawton.

49:23.351 --> 49:24.352
Chambliss:
I think that's a very kind of

49:24.396 --> 49:26.615
complicated moment for Strand.

49:26.659 --> 49:28.095
He says he's doing it
for Ofelia

49:28.139 --> 49:29.705
and I think there's
some truth to that.

49:29.749 --> 49:31.098
But, then, at the same time,

49:31.142 --> 49:33.709
there's a part of Strand
that is excited

49:33.753 --> 49:35.842
about the fact that he's going
to get to put Daniel

49:35.885 --> 49:38.627
in, essentially,
another jail cell at Lawton.

49:38.671 --> 49:39.672
Shall we?

49:39.715 --> 49:41.282
...it shows that Strand is

49:41.326 --> 49:42.588
the one who won, in the end.

49:42.631 --> 49:45.417
He's the one who outfoxed him.

49:45.460 --> 49:48.507
I'm going
to hold you to this.

49:48.550 --> 49:50.900
You don't have
to hold me to anything.

49:50.944 --> 49:52.946
I said what I said.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.469
So, you know,
once again, you know,

49:54.513 --> 49:56.732
Strand has both
some altruistic motives,

49:56.776 --> 49:58.908
but also some selfish motives
for doing what he does.
