09:46.542 --> 09:48.979
George?

09:49.023 --> 09:50.285
And who is George, exactly?

09:50.328 --> 09:52.635
Sam, it's not like that.

09:52.679 --> 09:56.639
I met him in Paraguay, uh,
before the ayahuasca ceremony.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.424
He pulled me out
when I came unstuck,

09:59.468 --> 10:01.731
especially when I was
spiraling about Dad.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.298
It was just nice
to have someone to talk to

10:03.341 --> 10:06.344
who didn't know me from before.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.129
No Carrington baggage.

10:08.172 --> 10:11.262
Right. Baggage.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.136
When I told him we had
a flat in Paris,

10:15.179 --> 10:16.833
he suggested we come here
for a change of scenery,

10:16.877 --> 10:18.487
and, uh, before...He suggested?

10:18.530 --> 10:19.662
What? He's staying here?

10:19.706 --> 10:22.491
[scoffs]
Are-are these his?

10:22.534 --> 10:24.058
Yes, Sam. He wears pants.

10:24.101 --> 10:29.019
Oh. So this George guy hears
that you have a flat in Paris,

10:29.063 --> 10:31.152
and suddenly,
he weasels his way into it.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.589
Things are starting
to make more sense now.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.199
You see,
Steven has always been

10:35.243 --> 10:36.592
an easy target
for gold diggers.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.727
No offence.This isn't that, Fallon.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.467
Let me guess, he's a poor,

10:42.511 --> 10:46.036
Paraguayan boy
who'd never seen Paris.He's British.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.647
And it's completely platonic.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.431
I-I know it's
our family's tendency

10:49.474 --> 10:51.694
to see the worst in people,
but George looked out for me

10:51.738 --> 10:53.391
when I-I couldn't.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.045
I want to meet him.Of course.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.481
You will.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.309
Right now I need to go
to the embassy

10:58.353 --> 10:59.528
to finalize some papers.

10:59.571 --> 11:02.618
I'd say come with,
but it always takes a bit

11:02.662 --> 11:04.533
and I can't bring anyone
in with me, so...

11:04.576 --> 11:06.187
why don't we all
meet for dinner later?

11:06.230 --> 11:09.712
Fine, but somewhere
iconic, please. I mean,

11:09.756 --> 11:11.496
we shouldn't
waste a good meal.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.541
I suppose I could eat.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.325
How about Café Marly? 8:00?

11:14.369 --> 11:16.153
I'll call George.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.981
You're gonna love him.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.679
I really am glad you're here.

11:24.422 --> 11:25.380
[sighs]

11:31.778 --> 11:33.257
SAM: I always thought I'd walk along

11:33.301 --> 11:35.956
the banks of the Seine for the first time with Steven.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.697
Not his sister.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.611
Not that this
isn't great.

11:39.655 --> 11:42.571
No, no,
it's my dream come true.

11:42.614 --> 11:43.964
Look, I feel for you, Sam.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.226
I mean, you met
my brother when

11:45.269 --> 11:47.445
he was at his most stable
and then, you know,

11:47.489 --> 11:48.925
he had his whole
identity crisis,

11:48.969 --> 11:50.144
wanting to go
find himself

11:50.187 --> 11:51.754
and now,
well, you're seeing

11:51.798 --> 11:54.148
the full tilt
Carrington spiral.

11:54.191 --> 11:57.151
I'm trying to give him
the benefit of the doubt

11:57.194 --> 12:00.937
and not be the
jealous husband.

12:00.981 --> 12:04.375
But why didn't he mention
this George guy before now?

12:04.419 --> 12:06.160
Because I am right.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.553
I mean, look,
Steven probably realizes

12:08.597 --> 12:10.251
he's being grifted,
but right now,

12:10.294 --> 12:11.818
it's easier for him
to be around someone

12:11.861 --> 12:13.776
who's fake
than someone who's real.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.344
George gets his
free Parisian vacation

12:16.387 --> 12:18.128
and my brother gets
a vacay from reality.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.740
Right, so same
reason why you were

12:20.783 --> 12:22.263
so game to fly
across the Atlantic

12:22.306 --> 12:23.786
and get away from Culhane?

12:23.830 --> 12:26.397
After you slept
with him again?

12:26.441 --> 12:27.834
Ah, look.

12:27.877 --> 12:31.098
A street artist in
Paris, how novel.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.364
Cristal?

12:36.407 --> 12:39.280
Blake asked me if
I would come up.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.937
I'm probably the last
person you want to see.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.287
And I'd understand if you
didn't want to see anyone.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.160
Could you give
us a moment?

12:55.122 --> 12:56.558
After Adam...

12:56.601 --> 12:59.213
[door closes]I went to bed and
wouldn't leave.

12:59.256 --> 13:02.172
I closed the blinds,
turned off all the lights

13:02.216 --> 13:03.565
and locked the door.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.834
When did it stop?

13:11.878 --> 13:13.357
The pain?

13:14.663 --> 13:16.056
It didn't.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.841
It just...

13:18.885 --> 13:23.280
moved behind other things,
instead of in front of them.

13:23.324 --> 13:24.978
Steven, Fallon...

13:25.021 --> 13:27.719
[exhales]

13:27.763 --> 13:31.027
They said I might not be able
to have children.

13:32.942 --> 13:35.249
And Mark...

13:35.292 --> 13:38.208
will never get to do anything
because of me.

13:39.644 --> 13:42.038
Cristal, it's not your fault.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.910
You know, the guilt
I felt after Adam,

13:43.953 --> 13:46.477
all the guilt in the world,
it didn't bring him back.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.524
I just hope that you

13:49.567 --> 13:51.874
don't spend 30
years trying to find

13:51.918 --> 13:54.355
some sort of...
closure.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.183
I won't.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.622
Once the investigation
confirms who did this.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.364
Confirms?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.714
Do they have a lead?

14:05.757 --> 14:07.629
They will find out.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.370
Blake promised.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.893
Hmm.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.765
And if you can't
trust family,

14:13.809 --> 14:15.724
who can you trust?

14:15.767 --> 14:17.030
[doorbell rings]

14:18.509 --> 14:20.381
Mack?

14:20.424 --> 14:23.384
Ms. Carrington.
It's been a while.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.343
Excuse me, Mr. Carrington
is expecting you.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.736
Please excuse us.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.312
BLAKE:
Get you a drink, Mack?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.575
I never drink on the job.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.012
And Anders said you had
a new one for me.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.408
Yeah, actually...

14:49.410 --> 14:51.673
I want to talk about
the last one.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.111
What happened yesterday?

14:55.155 --> 14:56.939
Yesterday?

14:56.983 --> 14:58.332
Mark Jennings.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.073
Nothing happened.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.162
Well, then let's talk about
what didn't happen.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.860
Because they drove Mark's body
off my property yesterday,

15:04.904 --> 15:06.470
my wife was almost killed

15:06.514 --> 15:08.255
and my child is gone.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.561
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.609
I told you
to rough him up.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.393
And then you told me
to stand down.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.308
So I did.Or you didn't get
the message,

15:18.352 --> 15:21.007
you came here to do the job
and you screwed it up.

15:22.704 --> 15:25.533
Remember who you're
talking to, Blake.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.056
You're the one
who called me.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.405
You went too far.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.885
And now you're lying
to cover your tracks.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.626
Be careful.

15:31.669 --> 15:34.324
And remember
who you'retalking to.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.023
[laughing]

15:37.066 --> 15:39.242
Well, it's nice of
you to join us.I'm so sorry.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.896
The embassy
always takes forever.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.205
Thought George
would have been here by now.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.294
You didn't bring him?

15:47.337 --> 15:49.470
No, he said he was
gonna meet us here.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.298
Well, it sounds like
Boy George doesn't want

15:51.341 --> 15:52.603
to show his face
to your family.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.344
Nothing suspicious
about that.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.520
I chose this spot
because he went

15:56.564 --> 15:58.305
to the Louvre
this afternoon.

15:58.348 --> 15:59.654
Maybe he got lost.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.395
I sent him with
a private docent.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.310
Did you also buy him
the Mona Lisa?

16:04.354 --> 16:06.356
Still pushing your
grifter theory?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.010
The only thing you're
proving right now, Fallon,

16:08.054 --> 16:10.012
is that I was right
to run away from

16:10.056 --> 16:11.579
our wildly paranoid,
judgmental family.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.276
Paranoid?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.931
Okay, I'll play.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.063
What do we know about George?

16:17.106 --> 16:17.977
What do you mean,
"what do we know?"

16:18.020 --> 16:18.716
I mean, what's his last name?

16:18.760 --> 16:20.544
Emerson.
Dubious name.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.198
Okay, and where is he from?
What does he do?

16:22.242 --> 16:23.852
London, he's a
philanthropist.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.550
God, Fallon, would
you just back off?Steven, take it easy.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.812
I'm fine, I just...

16:27.856 --> 16:30.511
keep getting the
third degree.
I'm sorry.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.817
I only care because I love you
and if this George

16:32.861 --> 16:35.037
is such a good influence,
then why are you a glass ahead

16:35.081 --> 16:36.386
of us already?
I mean, doesn't he know

16:36.430 --> 16:38.127
that you went to rehab?I hate to admit it,

16:38.171 --> 16:39.215
but she has a point.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.303
George has only looked after me.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.348
Oh yeah.
And what better way

16:41.391 --> 16:42.566
to look after you
than to keep you

16:42.610 --> 16:44.394
liquored up and isolated
from the people

16:44.438 --> 16:45.961
who truly care about you.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.094
Okay, you're gonna realize
how stupid this all sounds

16:48.137 --> 16:49.573
when you actually
meet him. In fact,

16:49.617 --> 16:50.748
I'm gonna go find him so we can

16:50.792 --> 16:52.402
clear this up
once and for all.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.274
Thanks for a
gorgeous dinner.Really?

16:56.102 --> 16:57.581
At least we know
something now

16:57.625 --> 17:00.845
about this George Emerson,
philanthropist from London.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.152
Okay, fine, that's all we know.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.894
But I have a cousin who can
help us find out more.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.769
BLAKE:
No, you killed him
and now you're lying about it.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.554
MACK:
I didn't kill
anyone, Blake.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.598
I told you I wasn't
anywhere near here.

17:14.642 --> 17:15.598
Then who was?

17:15.643 --> 17:17.645
[knock on door]

17:21.561 --> 17:22.650
Alexis.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.565
[clears throat]

17:24.608 --> 17:26.088
What's going on?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.698
Well, I was just
up with Cristal.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.048
Yeah, is she all right?

17:29.091 --> 17:31.441
Under the circumstances,
I suppose.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.095
But...
Thank you
for trying, at least.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.923
So, I'm about to finish up
this meeting, so...

17:34.966 --> 17:36.316
I'm sorry, I know, I didn't,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

17:36.359 --> 17:37.708
Thank you, Alexis, really.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.015
But as I was coming down,
I-I happened to notice

17:40.059 --> 17:42.061
the guy that was coming
to see you, that's Mack, right?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.063
Yes.
Who used to
work here?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.542
Is he coming back?

17:45.586 --> 17:48.197
Well, it's just that I saw
him around yesterday, too.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.634
Where? When?

17:50.678 --> 17:53.507
Um... at the stables?

17:53.550 --> 17:56.118
Around 3:30 or 4:00.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.686
Excuse me, please.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.688
[door opens]

18:08.304 --> 18:10.263
JULIETTE:
Ah, Steven. The smile...

18:10.306 --> 18:12.352
FALLON:
That emptied a thousand bottles
of champagne

18:12.395 --> 18:14.441
one New Year's Eve
at the Moulin Rouge.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.834
So Parisian legend has it.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.793
JULIETTE:
Tell him I'm disappointed.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.012
He's been here
for how many weeks in Paris

18:21.056 --> 18:22.623
and doesn't call
his favorite cousin?

18:22.666 --> 18:25.321
Well, he didn't even call us,
but you know Steven.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.801
[speaks French]

18:26.844 --> 18:28.019
What did she say?

18:28.063 --> 18:29.456
Steven has always been a loner.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.501
You know, his
alleged friend

18:31.545 --> 18:32.937
didn't even show
up last night,

18:32.981 --> 18:34.330
and then, when we went
to leave this morning,

18:34.374 --> 18:35.679
Steven was still
waiting for him.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.726
So maybe us showing up was
enough to scare him off.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.423
I'll have Papa's
security team

18:40.467 --> 18:42.469
look into the George
person, don't worry.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.297
How is Uncle Benjamin?

18:44.340 --> 18:45.776
In London,
dieu merci.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.865
Which means I'm having
a little party tonight

18:47.909 --> 18:50.346
at the château.
You must come.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.133
Oui, merci. Merci.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.530
She's the Frenchest person
I've ever met.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.098
Well, when her dad
was disinherited

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
by my grandfather, he married
a French billionaire.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.624
Crazy money,
questionable sources.

40:59.065 --> 41:02.634
you know, to see firsthand
the life that I've been denied.

41:02.677 --> 41:05.071
And you were
the easiest way in.

41:05.114 --> 41:09.815
This wounded bird,
so far from home.

41:09.858 --> 41:12.600
[American accent]: Away from
the Carrington fortress.

41:12.644 --> 41:16.386
Your accent...And the more I got to know you,
the more I grew to resent you,

41:16.430 --> 41:19.085
how ungrateful you are.
You had everything.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.523
And you walked away from it.

41:22.567 --> 41:25.352
And now I'm gonna claim it,

41:25.395 --> 41:28.442
everything my
father gave you.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.313
You know, it is
a real shame

41:30.357 --> 41:34.927
you won't be there
to welcome me home, brother.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.319
Adam?

41:36.363 --> 41:39.540
But we'll always have Paris.

41:47.069 --> 41:49.507
You knew...
