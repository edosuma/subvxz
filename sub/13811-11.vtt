if you want
to check it, Raymundo.

13:15.961 --> 13:20.216
You know, sometimes just hearing
about it is scary enough.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.968
Shh! You guys,
our show's about to start.

And heads up--

13:49.995 --> 13:52.623
next weekend we're going to be
coming to you live

13:52.706 --> 13:56.418
from Ocean Shores, where we'll
be taking over the boardwalk.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.129
So this is a shout
to all you in the area.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.257
Send us a video of your yourself

14:01.340 --> 14:03.884
demonstrating
your own new extreme sport,

14:03.968 --> 14:06.095
and if we pick you
as the most extreme

14:06.178 --> 14:08.722
you'll get to do a demo
live on our show!

14:08.806 --> 14:10.307
(<i> announcer falls, groans</i> )

14:10.391 --> 14:11.850
Did you guys hear that?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.937
A contest to create
our own extreme sport.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.772
{\an1}And they're going to film
in Ocean Shores!

14:16.855 --> 14:18.440
Let's get to work,
you guys.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.860
I am going to destroy
this competition.

14:25.406 --> 14:29.118
And now,
extreme French fry eating.

14:29.201 --> 14:29.910
(<i> eating noisily</i> )

14:32.079 --> 14:34.456
{\an5}OTTO:
Okay, gang,
what have we got so far?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.710
{\an5}SAM:
Well, as you can see,
my idea's a bit complex.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.586
But if we
can pull it off,

14:38.669 --> 14:42.298
victory will
surely be ours.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.508
All we need is
a snowboard, a helicopter,

14:44.592 --> 14:46.760
and a floating half pipe
made of ice.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.471
{\an1}REGGIE:
Sam...

14:49.555 --> 14:51.348
{\an1}how would we
possibly do that?

14:51.432 --> 14:53.726
I told you it's not
going to be easy.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.352
Next.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.687
All right, guys,

14:56.770 --> 14:59.607
get ready for...
skateboard shoes.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.693
Um, I think they already
have those, Twist.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.528
{\an4}SAM:
They're called
roller skates.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.738
Roller skates?

15:05.821 --> 15:07.990
I've never heard of those.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.658
Oh, well, I'm out of ideas.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.660
Twist, you just
worry about filming

15:11.744 --> 15:13.120
whatever we
come up with.

15:13.203 --> 15:13.912
{\an1}REGGIE: Well, then
grab your camera

15:13.996 --> 15:16.957
because my idea's ready to roll.

15:17.041 --> 15:17.958
OTTO:
All right!

15:18.042 --> 15:18.959
TWISTER:
Cool!

15:19.043 --> 15:20.002
SAM:
Let's go.

15:22.921 --> 15:26.675
I give you
the extreme shock bike.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.345
With these super springy shocks

15:29.428 --> 15:33.182
I should be able
to achieve mass air.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.600
Yeah, right.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.978
{\an4}Get ready
to catch the beef
of the century, Twist.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.487
Whoa!

15:49.698 --> 15:51.116
Yeah, whoo-hoo!

15:51.200 --> 15:52.368
Good run, Reg.

15:52.451 --> 15:52.993
All right!

15:54.787 --> 15:56.246
I bet I can do that.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.748
Let me give it a run.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.458
Ready to catch some
mad footage, Twist?

15:59.541 --> 16:02.211
Ready when you are.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.545
Whoa!

16:03.629 --> 16:07.466
(<i> yelling</i> )

16:07.549 --> 16:09.385
Whoa!

16:09.468 --> 16:10.511
(<i> grunts</i> )

16:11.970 --> 16:12.888
Whoa!

16:12.971 --> 16:13.472
The brakes, Otto!

16:13.555 --> 16:15.557
Pump the brakes!

16:15.641 --> 16:17.476
I can't look.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.646
(<i> shouts, then crash;</i>
<i>Otto grunts</i> )

16:22.773 --> 16:25.526
TWISTER:
Great footage, Otto!

16:25.609 --> 16:28.696
Ooh, what happened?

16:28.779 --> 16:32.074
Now for the winning sport--
boogie shoes!

16:32.157 --> 16:34.201
{\an4}OTTO:
Catch a wave,
strap on the shoes,

16:34.284 --> 16:37.329
and carve all the way
back to shore.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.669
Make sure you catch
my good side, Twist.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.631
Ooh...

16:50.217 --> 16:51.802
Whoa!

16:53.846 --> 16:55.472
Watch out!

16:55.556 --> 16:56.724
{\an1}OTTO:
Dude!

16:56.807 --> 16:59.184
(<i> both grunt</i> )

17:02.855 --> 17:04.356
Rocket boy,
are you okay?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.275
{\an1}Yeah.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.153
Man, these are bogus.

17:10.738 --> 17:14.491
Actually, with the proper weight
distribution and balance...

17:14.575 --> 17:16.242
Otto, can I give these a try?

17:16.326 --> 17:18.119
They're all
yours, Squid.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.789
Hold on, Squid,
I'll film you.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.082
Man! Strike two.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.752
I've got to come up
with something rideable.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.922
{\an1}I hate to say it, Otto,
but I think you did.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.883
Yeah, look at me!

17:30.966 --> 17:32.676
All right, look at the Squid go!

17:32.760 --> 17:34.553
Yes! Whoa!

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
{\an3}Great.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.600
{\an1}TWISTER:
That footage of the Squid

17:39.683 --> 17:41.393
{\an1}is good enough
to enter.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.437
Man, Reggie's
got an entry.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.313
Sam's got an entry.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.732
Dude, I've got to
get in the game!

17:46.815 --> 17:47.941
Well, you could have

17:48.025 --> 17:50.903
the other idea
I was toying with.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.323
I call it
"aggressive street walking."

17:54.406 --> 17:56.909
(<i> grunting</i> )

17:56.992 --> 17:57.910
Whoa!

17:57.993 --> 17:58.827
Yeah!

17:58.911 --> 18:02.080
Yeah, the 360 double toe grip.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.209
I've never landed
that before.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.002
Man, that's lame.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.545
I'm done for.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.215
(<i> plop</i> )

18:11.298 --> 18:12.382
(<i> whirring</i> )

18:15.010 --> 18:19.097
{\an1}Hey, little poi boy,
why the sour pineapple puss?

18:19.181 --> 18:21.350
We've been filming all day
for the extreme sports contest,

18:21.433 --> 18:25.562
but everything I try just ends
up in a pile of ground beef.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.524
{\an5}TITO:
Just remember
what the ancient Hawaiians say:

18:28.607 --> 18:30.651
{\an1}"Sometimes the tastiest
coconut is found

18:30.734 --> 18:33.195
on the shortest tree."

18:34.488 --> 18:35.864
What does that mean?

18:35.948 --> 18:39.243
It means maybe you're trying
too hard, little cuz.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.410
Trying too hard?

18:40.494 --> 18:43.622
Man, I'm not trying hard enough!

18:43.705 --> 18:48.210
{\an5}OTTO:
So after I catch a sweet wave
on my surf platform

18:48.293 --> 18:49.545
I hop on my skateboard

18:49.628 --> 18:51.338
{\an1}and bust a few
fat street moves

18:51.421 --> 18:52.840
as I glide shoreward.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.509
It's guaranteed to be awesome.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.429
Okay, Twist, get ready.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.727
Whoa!

19:05.811 --> 19:06.728
Whoa!

19:06.812 --> 19:08.272
(<i> shrieks</i> )

19:15.279 --> 19:16.405
Aah!

19:16.989 --> 19:20.242
Stop filming.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.585
You guys ready for some
extreme butt gliding?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.295
{\an1}I understand
the concept, Otto

19:31.378 --> 19:33.172
but with no feet
to slow you down

19:33.255 --> 19:34.256
how are you going to stop?

19:34.339 --> 19:35.591
Uh, well, I guess I...

19:35.674 --> 19:38.635
Whoa!

19:38.719 --> 19:41.388
(<i> screaming</i> )

19:43.265 --> 19:44.641
Whoa!

19:44.725 --> 19:45.809
(<i> crash;</i>
<i>Otto grunts</i> )

19:48.562 --> 19:49.521
(<i> muttering</i> )

19:49.605 --> 19:51.106
Stupid butt gliding!

19:51.189 --> 19:52.232
(<i> groans</i> )

19:53.233 --> 19:55.861
Extreme boardwalk
body sailing!

19:55.944 --> 19:58.280
{\an1}Are you sure
about this one, Otto?

19:58.363 --> 20:01.366
Reg, what could
possibly go wrong?

20:04.870 --> 20:09.416
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

20:12.961 --> 20:13.837
Hey, watch out!

20:13.921 --> 20:14.838
(<i> shouts</i> )

20:14.922 --> 20:16.048
(<i> grunts</i> )

20:16.131 --> 20:17.966

20:18.050 --> 20:18.967
(<i> crash</i> )

20:19.051 --> 20:19.426
(<i> grunts</i> )

20:21.511 --> 20:22.971
OTTO:
Ew!

20:24.139 --> 20:28.268
Would you turn that thing off!

20:28.352 --> 20:29.811
Aah!

20:35.108 --> 20:37.235
{\an1}TWISTER:
Well, that's it.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.987
I sent the tape in.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.782
I can't believe
I didn't come up with anything.

20:41.865 --> 20:42.991
So lame.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.452
Wow, he's really bummed.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.913
{\an5}TWISTER:
I've never seen him
so down before.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.457
{\an5}SAM:
If only he could
have mastered

20:50.540 --> 20:52.250
aggressive
street walking.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.299
(<i> grunting</i> )

20:59.383 --> 21:02.094
{\an5}OTTO:
Well, they're about
to announce the winners.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.679
Good luck, you guys.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.346
Thanks, Otto.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.473
I hope one
of us wins.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.892
Yeah, first place gets
to demonstrate, right?

21:08.976 --> 21:13.939
For this... whole crowd.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.192
Oh, please, don't let me win!

21:17.275 --> 21:18.694
Oh, please, don't let me win!

21:18.777 --> 21:20.028
Oh, please, don't let me win!

21:20.112 --> 21:21.446
(<i> crowd cheers</i> )

21:21.530 --> 21:24.324
All right, Ocean Shores!

21:24.408 --> 21:27.035
Are you ready for the winners
of the big contest?

21:27.119 --> 21:27.911
(<i> cheering</i> )

21:27.995 --> 21:32.749
Okay, third place goes to...

21:32.833 --> 21:35.252
Sam Dullard
for his boogie shoes.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.253
Huh?

21:36.336 --> 21:40.173
(<i> mild cheering and applause</i> )

21:40.257 --> 21:41.383
Third place!

21:41.466 --> 21:44.761
I don't have to do
a live demo?

21:44.845 --> 21:46.430
Oh, I mean... What?!

21:46.513 --> 21:48.223
Only third place!

21:48.307 --> 21:50.892
Second place goes to--
yeah!-- Reggie Rocket

21:50.976 --> 21:53.020
for her shock bike!

21:53.103 --> 21:57.232
(<i> crowd whooping</i> )

21:57.315 --> 22:00.277
And first place goes to...

22:00.360 --> 22:05.032
Otto Rocket and his scooter!

22:05.115 --> 22:05.657
ALL:
Otto?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.826
I won?

22:07.909 --> 22:08.660
{\an1}Oh, man!

22:08.744 --> 22:11.246
{\an1}I forgot that
was on the tape.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.999
Oh, yeah!

22:15.000 --> 22:16.168
Congrats, dude.

22:16.251 --> 22:19.421
{\an1}You ready to bust
a prime demo?

22:19.504 --> 22:23.592
Bro, I'm ready to rock
that pipe to shreds.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.093
(<i> whoops</i> )

22:25.177 --> 22:26.011
Whoa!

22:26.094 --> 22:29.890
(<i> whooping</i> )

22:32.017 --> 22:35.479
Only Otto could win a contest
without even being entered.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.438
Yep.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.939
We never had a chance.

22:38.023 --> 22:38.899
Thank heavens.

22:38.982 --> 22:39.816
But I still think

22:39.900 --> 22:42.611
aggressive street
walking has merit.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.236
What?

22:42.694 --> 22:43.236
What?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.113
Squid!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.113
Squid!

22:45.197 --> 22:46.698
(<i> both laugh</i> )

23:39.251 --> 23:40.502
{\an7}TITO:
The Titones!

23:40.585 --> 23:41.711
{\an8}RAY: X-Rays!

23:40.585 --> 23:41.711
{\an8}Titones!
