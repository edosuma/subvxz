WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:02.351
<i>Previously on x company.</i>

00:02.387 --> 00:04.687
I'm sorry, do I know you?
I suppose you do now.

00:04.721 --> 00:07.590
<i>Heidi adler. - Helene bauer.</i>

00:07.625 --> 00:10.793
<i>I'm a friend of the fabers.
So nice to meet you.</i>

00:10.828 --> 00:13.729
<i>Aurora, his feelings for you
make you all vulnerable.</i>

00:13.765 --> 00:16.499
End it.
That kiss, it was a mistake.

00:16.534 --> 00:19.969
Is this sinclair talking?
No. Believe me.

00:20.004 --> 00:22.438
I'm overseeing a special
project in poland. I need.

00:22.473 --> 00:25.941
A man with exceptional skill
to pacify the area.

00:25.977 --> 00:27.910
Your transfer has
already been approved.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.681
If faber's posted alongside
his father-in-law, it puts him.

00:31.716 --> 00:33.627
In a better position to learn
where the refineries are.

00:33.651 --> 00:35.384
That's why
you're going there too.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.564
I'll reach out to my old friend
at the ministry of transport.

00:37.588 --> 00:40.056
I have your word
that klaus is all right?

00:40.091 --> 00:43.759
Ernst, your son
died in the line of duty.

00:43.795 --> 00:47.396
And you come here asking me for favours?!
What kind of man does that?

00:47.432 --> 00:49.665
How did things
go with your contact?

00:49.701 --> 00:51.400
We need to find another way.

00:51.436 --> 00:53.436
<i>Maybe poland can be
a new beginning.</i>

00:53.471 --> 00:56.806
<i>And we get away from them.
Our obligations.</i>

00:56.841 --> 00:59.275
To each other are now over.
Not necessarily.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.444
<i>Did I tell
my father about the spies.</i>

01:01.479 --> 01:04.480
<i>Who pretend to be my friends?
Not yet.</i>

01:04.515 --> 01:06.348
You will help us in poland.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.560
Sabine?

01:17.595 --> 01:19.428
Sabine?

01:22.967 --> 01:24.934
Good morning! Where were you?

01:24.969 --> 01:27.536
I was hoping to be back
before you were up.

01:31.042 --> 01:32.875
I thought we should enjoy.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.777
Madame le guennec's croissants
on our last day.

01:34.812 --> 01:37.847
Made with butter. God knows how.

01:40.918 --> 01:44.987
Well, I'm going to get.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.790
The dishes.

01:47.825 --> 01:50.192
Who needs plates?

01:53.698 --> 01:57.266
If my father could see us now.

02:04.842 --> 02:08.144
What is it?
Something I need to tell you.

02:10.014 --> 02:12.448
All right.

02:12.483 --> 02:15.718
The allied spies, they're
travelling to poland too.

02:15.753 --> 02:18.220
Aurora will join us
on the train as helene bauer.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.725
Why?

02:22.760 --> 02:25.161
You said yourself, this is
a chance for us to start over.

02:25.196 --> 02:27.263
Those people bring us
nothing but trouble.

02:27.298 --> 02:29.932
My hands are tied.

02:29.967 --> 02:32.568
Go back and tell them no.
Sabine,

02:32.603 --> 02:34.570
I can't. Yes, you can.

02:34.605 --> 02:37.673
I can't. It's to protect you.
How does it protect me?

02:40.344 --> 02:42.344
They recorded a conversation
you had with aurora.

02:42.380 --> 02:44.446
What?! You told her we knew.

02:44.482 --> 02:46.348
About them,
that we let them into our home.

02:46.384 --> 02:49.084
God. That I had agreed.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.020
To help them. And now they can.

02:51.055 --> 02:53.022
Use this against us at any time,

02:53.057 --> 02:55.057
Force us do whatever they want.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.060
You had no way of knowing
they would do this.

03:00.264 --> 03:04.533
For now, we must cooperate.

03:10.474 --> 03:13.075
Can we trust him?
He's never been predictable.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.110
Worth the risk.
If the nazis get their hands.

03:15.146 --> 03:17.079
On that much oil,
the war's over.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.415
How did the americans respond?
Butler wants our intel.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.417
On marigold asap.
Course he does.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.330
He wants to know how we got
eyes and ears into poland.

03:23.354 --> 03:25.254
So you told him
all he has to do is turn.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.256
A high-ranking ss officer?
I did not.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.725
And colonel mayhew?
He thinks it's terrific.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.827
He's been pushing
for an attack on oil since '39.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.829
It's good to have you back, sir.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.831
It's good to be back.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.567
It's been a busy week.

03:38.603 --> 03:40.502
Where are we with papers
for neil and harry?

03:40.538 --> 03:43.250
Harry dropped off the photographs.
Papers will be ready in a few hours.

03:43.274 --> 03:46.408
Good. Faber's agent,

03:46.444 --> 03:48.677
We fed him the false intel
as you asked.

03:48.713 --> 03:50.691
We're questioning the local
fascists he was working with.

03:50.715 --> 03:53.482
And I heard you took care
of the man yourself.

03:53.517 --> 03:56.151
Yes, sir. Good.

03:56.187 --> 03:59.088
Sir, I'd like to renew
my request for field training.

03:59.123 --> 04:01.156
I'll consider it.

04:01.192 --> 04:03.225
Once I've caught up.
Thank you, krystina.

04:10.301 --> 04:13.335
Your successor seems eager
to maintain your high standards.

04:13.371 --> 04:16.939
<i>What do you mean? This morning, oberfuhrer
fischer ordered the mass arrests.</i>

04:16.974 --> 04:19.608
Of resistance members. He said.

04:19.644 --> 04:21.622
They must pay for the hijacking
of the fuhrer's broadcast.

04:21.646 --> 04:23.812
Idiot.

04:25.216 --> 04:27.182
<i>Herr brigadefuhrer?</i>

04:27.218 --> 04:29.351
He wants to look good
to the powers in berlin.

04:29.387 --> 04:31.987
But now the resistance will be
twice as cautious and go.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.989
Deeper underground,
and a more cautious enemy.

04:34.025 --> 04:36.025
Is harder to catch.

04:38.029 --> 04:41.363
"A more cautious enemy
is harder to catch."

04:42.833 --> 04:45.134
What are you doing? Memorizing.

04:45.169 --> 04:47.436
I keep a journal.

04:53.044 --> 04:55.544
No, no. I am definitely
more humphrey bogart.

04:55.579 --> 04:57.913
Than what's-his-chops.
His name is Joseph cotten.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.883
Ok, you feel like a bogart.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.885
But in that photo,
you look exactly like cotten.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.887
What do you mean,
I "feel" like humphrey bogart?

05:04.922 --> 05:06.989
It doesn't even matter.
Just forget about it.

05:07.024 --> 05:10.759
Then why did you say it then?
Well, I'm sorry I did.

05:10.795 --> 05:13.696
I don't like using a forger
I haven't personally vetted,

05:13.731 --> 05:15.965
Resistance or not.
Well, we're running low.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.967
On options.
You're telling me faber.

05:18.002 --> 05:19.969
Can't pull a few strings
to get us papers?

05:20.004 --> 05:22.004
What use is he then?
You don't trust faber?

05:22.039 --> 05:24.573
Course, I bloody don't.
Well, sinclair seems to.

05:24.608 --> 05:26.608
Yeah, nobody's perfect.

05:26.644 --> 05:28.777
Look at us out here trying
to scrounge a way to get...

05:34.952 --> 05:37.619
Is that our guy? Yeah, it's him.

05:37.655 --> 05:39.621
Let's get back
to the safe house.

05:39.657 --> 05:41.523
Yeah. Get ourselves
out of paris. Gestapo have.

05:41.559 --> 05:44.226
Our photos now.

05:46.230 --> 05:48.397
He's late. He'll be here.

05:50.334 --> 05:52.768
He will. We're selling faber.

05:52.803 --> 05:54.770
On the idea that we're
on the same side.

05:54.805 --> 05:56.717
We had to use the recording;
It was the only way.

05:56.741 --> 05:58.974
To ensure his cooperation.
You once told me blackmail.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.976
Was not a long-term plan.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.245
It was for the security
of the team.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.147
We had no choice.

06:05.182 --> 06:07.483
We sacrifice a lot of things
for the security.

06:07.518 --> 06:10.652
Of the team.

06:15.559 --> 06:18.227
This couldn't wait?
We apologize,

06:18.262 --> 06:20.295
But the circumstances
are serious.

06:20.331 --> 06:22.297
Our contact was arrested
by the gestapo.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.299
He was making papers
for neil and harry.

06:24.335 --> 06:26.346
My successor wants to make a
statement. It's out of my hands.

06:26.370 --> 06:28.337
We need german papers for them.

06:28.372 --> 06:31.240
Papers take time.
I'm leaving for poland today.

06:31.275 --> 06:33.409
The forger had neil
and harry's photographs.

06:33.444 --> 06:35.944
Then, they need to disappear.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.414
Tomorrow, their faces will be
on posters across the city.

06:38.449 --> 06:40.416
That's why we need them
on a train today.

06:40.451 --> 06:44.019
Can they come with us,
as our guests? No.

06:44.055 --> 06:46.989
"Helene bauer" is our guest
because you have german papers.

06:47.024 --> 06:50.659
According to your cover,
you should be in norway.

06:50.694 --> 06:53.996
As for the other two? You could be
travelling with the fuhrer himself,

06:54.031 --> 06:55.931
You'd still need papers
to cross into germany.

06:55.966 --> 06:58.000
So how can we
get them to poland?

06:58.035 --> 07:00.335
It's not my problem. Please,

07:00.371 --> 07:02.604
Don't make us
make it your problem.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.880
There is one way to cross
those borders without papers.

07:11.916 --> 07:14.149
We're listening.

07:14.185 --> 07:16.885
Move it. Continue.

07:16.921 --> 07:18.921
Continue.

07:18.956 --> 07:21.023
Move. Move.

07:22.993 --> 07:24.960
It stops at a town called pomoc.

07:24.995 --> 07:26.973
He'll be waiting on the platform
to take us off the train.

07:26.997 --> 07:29.131
Course he will.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.268
It's ok.

07:36.407 --> 07:38.073
Move!

07:38.109 --> 07:40.175
Come on. Thanks.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.283
Anything other than this?

07:48.319 --> 07:50.619
We have coffee or tea.

07:52.623 --> 07:55.257
<i>Next stop,
epernay. Epernay, next stop.</i>

07:57.194 --> 07:59.261
Good afternoon.

08:04.768 --> 08:06.969
Will you bring me
some more sugar, please?

08:10.708 --> 08:13.809
Sabine... do you honestly believe
I'll talk to you after what you did?

08:15.813 --> 08:17.746
I'm sorry.

08:17.781 --> 08:19.748
I wouldn't have done it
unless it was absolutely.

08:19.783 --> 08:22.417
Necessary. Spare me.

08:22.453 --> 08:24.520
It's critical
you play along, sabine.

08:28.292 --> 08:30.292
Keep it away. We'll be alright.

08:30.327 --> 08:32.928
It is bloody gone?

08:38.769 --> 08:41.370
Come on, sit down!

08:41.405 --> 08:44.673
Everybody, sit down!

08:48.445 --> 08:51.480
Sit down!

08:51.515 --> 08:53.482
Are you kidding me?
Prisoners get.

08:53.517 --> 08:56.351
Special treatment
if they agree to help.

08:56.387 --> 08:58.487
Unbelievable.

08:58.522 --> 09:01.123
How did you know that? Drabek.

09:01.158 --> 09:03.425
Bloody hell!

09:05.000 --> 09:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:24.522 --> 09:26.689
You were living in the marais?

09:26.724 --> 09:28.468
We hid in our apartments
during the round-ups,

09:28.492 --> 09:30.459
But the germans found us
a few days later.

09:30.494 --> 09:33.095
How? Our neighbours.

09:33.130 --> 09:35.864
People we used
to have dinner with.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.867
As they took us away, I asked him,
"why?" you know what he said?

09:38.903 --> 09:42.705
"Because you are a jew."

09:42.740 --> 09:45.541
I want to ensure.

09:45.576 --> 09:47.676
We have a smooth trip,
and this will only happen.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.612
If we all behave. Is that clear?
Where are we going?

09:50.648 --> 09:52.681
Who put you in charge?

09:54.585 --> 09:56.785
We're going to a work camp,

09:56.821 --> 09:58.821
And the germans
put me in charge.

09:58.856 --> 10:01.523
No more talking.

10:03.761 --> 10:06.628
What kind of work?

10:06.664 --> 10:09.431
I don't know, ben.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.872
Here you go.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.941
Thank you. Ma'am.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.760
There's one thing I've been
meaning to tell you, and

10:26.784 --> 10:29.017
I promise you it's the truth.
When you say that,

10:29.053 --> 10:31.019
I know you're about
to lie to me.

10:31.055 --> 10:33.422
Please.

10:33.457 --> 10:35.391
Do you know how exhausting it is.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.527
To be lied to all the time?

10:38.562 --> 10:40.796
It goes both ways.

10:43.734 --> 10:45.801
I've spent days where it felt.

10:45.836 --> 10:48.971
Like I never spoke
a single true word.

10:49.006 --> 10:52.808
By the end of those days,

10:52.843 --> 10:55.544
I feel like there's
nothing left of me.

10:57.548 --> 10:59.715
I was ready to hate you.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.718
For so many reasons,

11:02.753 --> 11:04.420
But then I met you,
and I couldn't.

11:06.323 --> 11:08.724
There were lots of times
when our friendship was real,

11:08.759 --> 11:12.261
When I told you things
that I hadn't told a living soul.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.798
Because I knew...
I knew that you'd understand.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.699
May I join you?

11:17.735 --> 11:20.135
Please sit. I had no idea.

11:20.171 --> 11:23.272
You were coming with us, helene.
Yes, well,

11:23.307 --> 11:26.775
Here I am. Yes,
I was just thanking sabine.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.911
For inviting me along.

11:28.946 --> 11:31.158
I thought she'd appreciate
having a familiar face around.

11:31.182 --> 11:33.148
While she settles in.
You travelled all this way.

11:33.184 --> 11:36.385
To help your friend settle in?
That's very kind of you.

11:36.420 --> 11:39.021
Helene is always up
for adventure.

11:39.056 --> 11:41.056
Is that so?

11:41.091 --> 11:44.593
Marvellous! I'm glad the museum
were willing to give you time off.

11:44.628 --> 11:48.230
Well, they didn't really have
a choice. I quit this morning.

11:48.265 --> 11:50.165
You do like adventure.

11:50.201 --> 11:52.901
You know I told you
about my boss yesterday?

11:52.937 --> 11:55.137
I want nothing to do.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.774
With stolen artwork
or his wandering hands.

11:58.809 --> 12:02.444
For that matter.
No, I'm taking a clean break.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.147
I'll find another way
to do my part for the reich.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.149
What disgusting behaviour.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.885
Yes. Absolutely disgusting.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.287
When I told sabine I had quit,

12:12.323 --> 12:14.289
She didn't hesitate,
"pack your bags.

12:14.325 --> 12:16.492
And come to poland!"
how spontaneous!

12:16.527 --> 12:18.894
I love it!
Sabine, you said that?

12:20.998 --> 12:24.099
I couldn't imagine leaving
helene alone in paris.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.568
And sabine likes to get her way.

12:26.604 --> 12:30.539
I'm a little bit jealous.
You two are like sisters.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.550
We're going to be ok.

12:41.585 --> 12:44.319
We arrive soon.
Did you take off your star?

12:44.355 --> 12:46.054
No.

12:46.090 --> 12:48.323
We're political prisoners.

12:48.359 --> 12:50.325
When the germans took paris,

12:50.361 --> 12:52.961
We were international students
at the sorbonne.

12:52.997 --> 12:54.997
That's why
you have funny accents.

12:57.401 --> 13:01.403
We stayed and organized
protests against the occupation.

13:01.438 --> 13:04.673
You're lucky you're not jewish.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.878
I go to school too.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.348
I mean, I-i did. Do you like it?

13:13.384 --> 13:17.185
I don't know. When I learn
things, they wash away.

13:20.324 --> 13:23.058
My friend,
when he learns things,

13:23.093 --> 13:25.227
It's like when you carve it
into a stone.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.229
You keep the stone
your whole life.

13:27.264 --> 13:30.599
Really? You must know
a lot of things.

13:33.370 --> 13:35.637
Aaah.

13:37.641 --> 13:39.741
Some people think
we are being sent.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.044
To the camps to be killed.

13:42.079 --> 13:44.513
Benj. Don't worry.

13:44.548 --> 13:47.149
Why not? My father doesn't think.

13:47.184 --> 13:50.919
It's true, and he's never wrong.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.121
I feel sick.

13:55.826 --> 13:57.893
I need air.

13:57.928 --> 14:01.129
I need... I need... I need...

14:01.165 --> 14:05.534
I need air.
I... I can't breathe! I can't!

14:05.569 --> 14:07.135
I need air! Calm down!

14:07.171 --> 14:09.538
Don't touch me! Stop that.

14:09.573 --> 14:11.540
I can't breathe!

14:11.575 --> 14:14.076
I can't breathe!
Get down, you idiot!

14:14.111 --> 14:16.878
No! No!

14:16.914 --> 14:19.915
That's enough.
Get your hands off me!

14:19.950 --> 14:21.917
I'm keeping you safe,
you understand?

14:24.288 --> 14:27.122
<i>Quiet. Qu'est-ce qui se passe?</i>

14:29.627 --> 14:32.327
Well, of course,
your boss was french.

14:32.363 --> 14:34.830
I mean, yes, they know
how to cook, but their manners?

14:34.865 --> 14:37.199
I hear they make.

14:37.234 --> 14:39.668
Terrible lovers.
That is no rumour.

14:39.703 --> 14:41.336
Believe me.

14:48.045 --> 14:50.646
And what about your work, heidi?

14:50.681 --> 14:53.315
Well, it's one
of the most important projects.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.317
For the future of germany.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.753
I'm intrigued.
The staff is almost all women.

14:57.788 --> 15:01.690
Intelligent, forward-thinking,
independent women.

15:01.725 --> 15:03.525
Cultured, like you two.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.328
We'll all be friends,
I'm sure of it.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.797
I'm sure. But I didn't know.

15:08.832 --> 15:11.266
That natural resources.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.435
Were employing so many women.
"natural resources"?

15:13.470 --> 15:16.338
<i>You work with obergruppenfuhrer
schmidt, don't you?</i>

15:16.373 --> 15:19.541
In the same building,
but different departments.

15:19.576 --> 15:21.710
Aaah. What do you do?

15:21.745 --> 15:24.346
We are the pioneers
of the new germany.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.450
I showed franz
the photos of your new house.

15:28.485 --> 15:30.218
You'll love it.

15:30.254 --> 15:32.554
Does he enjoy hosting parties?
We have many in poland.

15:32.589 --> 15:35.090
Well, he doesn't like
small talk and dance,

15:35.125 --> 15:37.693
So, no, he doesn't enjoy them.
What a pity.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.162
You should ask helene.

15:40.197 --> 15:42.197
Not only did she get
franz to dance,

15:42.232 --> 15:45.067
But your father as well.

15:45.102 --> 15:47.035
Is that so?

15:47.071 --> 15:50.038
Well, obergruppenfuhrer schmidt
is the one who asked.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.140
It would have been
rude to decline.

15:52.176 --> 15:55.477
Yes. That's true.

15:55.512 --> 15:57.579
Excuse me. I need some air.

15:57.614 --> 15:59.648
Sorry.

16:02.119 --> 16:04.186
I'm sorry if i...

16:04.221 --> 16:07.255
No. Not at all. The dance
meant nothing of course,

16:07.291 --> 16:09.157
But sometimes it's hard.

16:09.193 --> 16:12.761
For a daughter to see
her father as a man.

16:12.796 --> 16:15.697
Of course. He does dote on her.

16:15.733 --> 16:18.600
Tell me more
about being a pioneer.

16:18.635 --> 16:20.268
Ok, I need to know...

16:20.304 --> 16:21.937
Sir? From harry.

16:21.972 --> 16:24.573
Sent before they left paris
this morning.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.754
It took the new girl some time to decrypt
the message. They're on a train to poland.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.545
Headed for a concentration camp.

16:30.581 --> 16:33.248
The resistance forger
was arrested.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.250
How could this happen?
I thought klaus's father...

16:35.285 --> 16:37.552
It was just not possible.

16:37.588 --> 16:40.555
Did something happen in paris?

16:40.591 --> 16:43.558
Krystina, I'm afraid that I can't
agree to your field training.

16:43.594 --> 16:45.460
Sir... I need my best people here.

16:45.496 --> 16:48.630
To bring down operation
marigold. That means you.

17:06.683 --> 17:08.683
I think we need
to tell them the truth.

17:10.753 --> 17:13.155
I think they know. Thank you.

17:13.190 --> 17:16.458
What do you mean?

17:16.492 --> 17:19.795
When drabek first told us,

17:19.829 --> 17:22.230
We didn't want to believe it.

17:22.266 --> 17:25.166
And if you don't believe it,
there's hope.

17:25.202 --> 17:27.836
And if you have hope...

17:27.871 --> 17:30.639
You find a way to survive.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.108
Here.

17:43.821 --> 17:45.654
Thank you.

17:58.402 --> 18:01.303
Franz! Yes.

18:01.338 --> 18:03.305
Tell me what's happening.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.307
The cargo train's
just south of us.

18:05.342 --> 18:07.342
It crosses our path
in pomoc, just ahead.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.955
We'll arrive
just before they stop to load,

18:08.979 --> 18:10.990
And I'll make sure they're
pulled off the train in time.

18:11.014 --> 18:13.815
And then what happens?
It's taken care of.

18:13.851 --> 18:17.018
I'd like to know.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.154
I've arranged
for a truck at the station.

18:19.189 --> 18:21.189
We'll drop them off
in the woods before...

18:24.661 --> 18:26.628
Is this your people?

18:26.663 --> 18:29.631
No. Go! Go!

18:52.856 --> 18:54.789
This is it. Is this the camp?

18:54.825 --> 18:56.725
Is this the camp? I don't know.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.995
I think I see faber.

19:00.030 --> 19:02.397
Thank christ. I need water.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.332
We need to get
some food and some water.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.874
Let's go.

19:17.314 --> 19:19.314
<i>Ready? Move it! Ja.</i>

19:23.120 --> 19:25.287
I knew it.

19:25.322 --> 19:27.289
He's not here.

19:27.324 --> 19:29.357
Women and children,
off the train!

19:29.393 --> 19:31.126
Now, quickly
or you will be shot!

19:31.161 --> 19:34.062
I will not say it again!
Let's go! Move!

19:34.097 --> 19:36.531
Come here.

19:36.566 --> 19:40.035
Women and children, let's go!
Come on!

19:40.070 --> 19:42.837
Come on, let's go!
Watch your rifle!

19:44.775 --> 19:47.075
Women and children! Stay back!

19:47.110 --> 19:50.245
No! Not you! Faster!

19:50.280 --> 19:52.948
Let's go! Move!

19:54.618 --> 19:58.153
Get over here! Let's go!
Women and children! Now! Now!

19:58.188 --> 20:01.289
Let's go!
I won't leave you. I promise.

20:06.964 --> 20:08.730
Let's go!

20:08.765 --> 20:10.932
After release.

20:10.968 --> 20:12.934
You cannot do this!

20:12.970 --> 20:16.271
Is that all of them? That's it.

20:16.306 --> 20:19.240
Only men back here.
No, we are not splitting up.

20:19.276 --> 20:21.242
Either she stays here
or I go with her.

20:21.278 --> 20:23.178
Let's go! Don't touch her!

20:23.213 --> 20:26.147
Let her go! No!

20:29.319 --> 20:32.787
Get her off the train!
Stay back!

20:32.823 --> 20:35.824
Out of my way! What did you do?!

20:37.861 --> 20:40.628
Take her.

20:40.664 --> 20:44.532
Let's go! On the train! Go!
The train move, get going! Now!

20:44.568 --> 20:46.501
Quiet. Do as they say.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.004
Faster! Get up!

20:49.039 --> 20:51.473
Faster, go!

20:51.508 --> 20:53.641
Move! Move it!

20:53.677 --> 20:56.311
How many men were on this car?

20:56.346 --> 20:59.114
26, sir. 47 now.

20:59.149 --> 21:03.184
If they are not exactly 47
when we arrive at the camp,

21:03.220 --> 21:05.253
Every person of this car
will be shot!

21:05.288 --> 21:07.255
Is that clear?

21:12.295 --> 21:15.130
Let's go. Lock it up!

21:19.069 --> 21:21.870
What's going on?! Take cover!
Close the curtains!

21:24.408 --> 21:27.409
Status. Armed fighters.
They're robbing passengers.

21:27.444 --> 21:29.344
And executing uniforms.
Polish resistance.

21:29.379 --> 21:32.147
We make our stand here.
Let me help.

21:32.182 --> 21:34.916
You two cover that way.

21:37.854 --> 21:40.422
Argh!

21:48.031 --> 21:49.664
It is my job to ensure.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.866
That we behave on our journey
to the labour camp.

21:51.902 --> 21:54.402
We know exactly where we're
going and exactly what you are.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.372
Everyone, calm down.
I just watched my wife.

21:57.407 --> 21:59.774
Shot in the head,
and you want me to calm down?!

21:59.810 --> 22:03.111
We're all prisoners here.
But only one of us.

22:03.146 --> 22:05.714
Is working with the nazis.
You said.

22:05.749 --> 22:09.284
You know where we are going? To a camp.
I don't know which one.

22:09.319 --> 22:11.953
But they are work camps, yes?
Not all of them.

22:11.988 --> 22:13.955
You heard this? Yes.

22:13.990 --> 22:16.257
People are sent to camps,
and no one hears.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.860
From them again. Is that true?

22:18.895 --> 22:21.796
I don't know anything!

22:21.832 --> 22:24.532
Easy, easy! If you know
something, tell us!

22:24.568 --> 22:27.035
Yes, tell us! We need to know.

22:27.070 --> 22:29.537
Let him go!
I will as soon as he tells us.

22:29.573 --> 22:32.941
Everything he knows.
I know where we're going.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.044
We're headed
to a concentration camp,

22:36.079 --> 22:38.079
Just outside warsaw.

22:39.783 --> 22:41.950
It's an extermination camp.

22:53.964 --> 22:56.030
We're out.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.135
What do we do?

23:00.170 --> 23:03.738
Surrender or we die.
Look at sabine.

23:08.612 --> 23:10.645
We surrender!

23:10.680 --> 23:13.248
We surrender! We surrender!
We surrender!

23:13.283 --> 23:15.717
We surrender!
Get up, all of you!

23:17.788 --> 23:20.889
Sabine.

23:26.897 --> 23:31.099
Are you deaf? We surrendered!
Patience, pig.

23:31.134 --> 23:33.201
You're next. Hold on!

23:35.739 --> 23:38.373
He's right, they surrendered.

23:38.408 --> 23:40.608
The least we can do
is give them the courtesy.

23:40.644 --> 23:42.644
Of executing them standing up.

23:48.652 --> 23:50.819
We must be doing something right
if adolf's sending.

23:50.854 --> 23:52.821
<i>A brigadefuhrer to deal with us.</i>

23:52.856 --> 23:54.856
What is your name?

23:57.227 --> 24:00.662
Fine. I'll call you fritz.

24:00.697 --> 24:02.764
Here is this thing, fritz.

24:04.568 --> 24:08.002
Poland is not france.

24:08.038 --> 24:10.705
We never surrendered
after you invaded us,

24:10.740 --> 24:13.308
Because, frankly,

24:13.343 --> 24:16.444
We'd rather fight until
every last one of us is dead.

24:18.448 --> 24:20.548
We know this train is carrying
a shipment of weapons,

24:20.584 --> 24:23.117
And we'd very much like
to take them with us.

24:25.121 --> 24:27.222
Where are the guns?

24:34.097 --> 24:36.631
Silence.

24:36.666 --> 24:40.034
<i>Is not your friend right now,
brigadefuhrer fritz.</i>

24:47.611 --> 24:50.578
You don't know what you're talking about.
We had a friend in paris,

24:50.614 --> 24:52.714
Pavel drabek. He escaped
from one of the camps.

24:52.749 --> 24:56.150
If the germans wanted to kill us,
why didn't they do it in paris?

24:56.186 --> 24:58.397
Why make us travel all this way?
It just doesn't make sense.

24:58.421 --> 25:00.388
Does anything
the boche do make sense?

25:00.423 --> 25:02.357
We have to escape.
But what if he is wrong?

25:02.392 --> 25:04.392
What if we are going
to the work camp?

25:04.427 --> 25:07.795
Do you think that will be any
kind of life? Maybe not.

25:07.831 --> 25:11.466
I will do everything I can
to keep my son alive.

25:15.272 --> 25:17.805
Yes.

25:17.841 --> 25:20.842
If we do escape, it has to be all of us.
We can't condemn the others.

25:24.247 --> 25:27.615
Why would we trust him?

25:27.651 --> 25:29.984
What choice do we have?

25:30.020 --> 25:33.321
What is it?

25:35.692 --> 25:38.426
You know something, don't you?

25:43.333 --> 25:45.266
Can you help us?

25:47.804 --> 25:49.804
Which one of you is his wife?

25:56.179 --> 25:58.046
I'm his wife. Yeah?

26:00.083 --> 26:02.517
Now tell me...

26:02.552 --> 26:04.652
Helene. Helene.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.722
Are you a fortune teller?

26:07.757 --> 26:10.191
I ask because I see
you are already wearing.

26:10.226 --> 26:13.328
Your ring on your widow hand.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.997
Or is it wishful thinking?

26:27.711 --> 26:30.979
Very pretty.

26:31.014 --> 26:33.381
Is that your wife?

26:33.416 --> 26:36.250
Is. That. Your wife?

26:39.155 --> 26:40.855
Nooo!

26:45.695 --> 26:49.030
All you had to do was say yes!

26:49.065 --> 26:51.799
Ready to have a conversation
about guns, fritz?

26:51.835 --> 26:54.369
Yes.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.404
Good.

26:56.439 --> 26:58.840
It's too risky to go.

27:01.511 --> 27:05.413
I'm doing this for my family.

27:05.448 --> 27:07.648
This is the only reason
I help the germans.

27:07.684 --> 27:10.818
I understand.
They'll understand too.

27:10.854 --> 27:13.888
It doesn't matter.
Of course, it matters.

27:13.923 --> 27:16.190
You don't understand.

27:16.226 --> 27:18.259
Everyone here,

27:18.294 --> 27:20.395
We're already dead.

27:22.966 --> 27:25.133
Yeah,

27:25.168 --> 27:27.301
We're already dead,

27:27.337 --> 27:29.704
But only if we don't
do anything.

27:29.739 --> 27:32.673
Because if we fight,
then there's hope.

27:32.709 --> 27:36.244
There's hope for everybody here.
Including you.

27:45.255 --> 27:47.221
Leave her alone.
I'll tell you everything.

27:47.257 --> 27:50.258
All right.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.794
The guns aren't on this train.

27:52.829 --> 27:56.197
I don't like this answer.

27:56.232 --> 27:59.067
I rerouted the shipment
at the last minute.

27:59.102 --> 28:00.880
The guns arrived in pruszko
on yesterday's train.

28:00.904 --> 28:03.304
You're lying. He's not!

28:03.339 --> 28:06.074
I oversaw the shipment
transfer myself.

28:06.109 --> 28:08.109
Yeah?

28:08.144 --> 28:11.245
Well, you would've made
a worthy opponent, fritz.

28:11.281 --> 28:13.448
No time for last words,
I'm afraid, so...

28:13.483 --> 28:15.650
Please don't kill us! Stop!
Shut up!

28:15.685 --> 28:18.086
Please. You're making a mistake.

28:18.121 --> 28:20.288
Get out of the way.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.290
He's worth more as a prisoner.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.392
Than as a corpse.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.058
Kill him.

28:32.094 --> 28:34.160
Send a message. Send a message.

28:34.196 --> 28:37.631
His replacement should be
nervous about ever entering

28:37.666 --> 28:39.599
Polish soil again. This one.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.768
Made a valid point though.
She's right.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.137
Leave the women here,
take me prisoner.

28:44.172 --> 28:47.474
We'll take you all prisoners. If you do,
I'll fight until you have to shoot me.

28:47.509 --> 28:50.043
Sounds good to me.

28:50.078 --> 28:52.979
I can be valuable to you.

28:59.321 --> 29:02.522
They promised me
that shira, my sister,

29:02.557 --> 29:04.858
They would put her
into a work camp.

29:04.893 --> 29:07.661
She has a club foot,
you understand?

29:09.665 --> 29:12.933
So if I didn't say yes,
they would have...

29:12.968 --> 29:15.669
They use gas.

29:17.439 --> 29:20.473
The camps, the rumours
you've heard.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.276
Are true. But how can that be?

29:23.312 --> 29:26.713
Everyone.

29:26.748 --> 29:28.715
They're dead?

29:31.586 --> 29:33.553
I'm sorry. No.

29:33.588 --> 29:37.290
The truth is better.

29:37.326 --> 29:39.492
You are right,
we have to escape.

29:39.528 --> 29:42.996
All of us. We won't all make it.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.665
Isn't it better some of us
live than all of us die?

29:45.701 --> 29:47.400
You'll remember me,

29:47.436 --> 29:50.971
Right?

29:51.006 --> 29:53.239
Of course, I will.

29:53.275 --> 29:54.874
And everyone here?

29:54.910 --> 29:57.577
Carved in stone,

29:57.612 --> 29:59.579
Just like I said.

29:59.614 --> 30:02.816
Everything I see or hear.

30:02.851 --> 30:05.618
Could you do it for everyone?

30:12.227 --> 30:13.893
I could.

30:13.929 --> 30:15.462
Please?

30:25.107 --> 30:28.675
My friend here is a kind of.

30:28.710 --> 30:31.544
Storyteller.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.847
If you tell him
something about yourself,

30:33.882 --> 30:35.982
He'll never forget it.

30:38.020 --> 30:40.387
If he survives,

30:40.422 --> 30:43.390
He'll make sure
you're all remembered.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.425
Right, benjamin?

31:00.275 --> 31:03.476
I think I might have an idea
how to get out of here.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.252
These are the names.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.254
Of six of our fighters
in german custody.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.657
I will trade...

31:17.692 --> 31:19.993
What's his name?

31:20.028 --> 31:23.563
<i>Brigadefuhrer franz faber.</i>

31:23.598 --> 31:25.899
I'll trade fritz for them,

31:25.934 --> 31:28.635
4 p.M. Sharp where I've
indicated on the paper.

31:28.670 --> 31:31.171
But...
There will be no negotiation.

31:31.206 --> 31:33.940
Unless all six prisoners
are there,

31:33.975 --> 31:36.543
We'll execute him.

31:36.578 --> 31:39.712
I'll deliver this to
the pruszko authorities myself.

31:39.748 --> 31:41.314
Good boy.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.222
No!

31:50.792 --> 31:53.159
Welcome to poland.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.267
Leon hirsch.

32:01.303 --> 32:03.303
I met my wife clara.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.805
When we were
both working in toulouse.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.807
Before the war.

32:07.843 --> 32:11.377
Even if we could
jump, train's going too fast.

32:11.413 --> 32:14.447
When we got on,
I noticed the car behind us.

32:14.483 --> 32:16.983
Was being loaded with oil drums.
Oil?

32:17.018 --> 32:20.520
If we could start a fire...

32:20.555 --> 32:23.089
They'd have to stop.

32:23.125 --> 32:25.992
And put it out or they'd risk
blowing up the train.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.461
The germans would have
to open the doors.

32:28.497 --> 32:30.530
What about the others?

32:30.565 --> 32:33.333
What others? In the other cars.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.702
Aren't we going
to help them escape?

32:35.737 --> 32:38.171
He has a point. It'll be risky.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.473
Opening the other wagons.
Every car's got a guard on it.

32:40.509 --> 32:43.243
So shouldn't we at least try
to help free them?

32:43.278 --> 32:45.245
I'll do it.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.147
I'll open the other wagons.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.482
And when the guard opens
the door, I'll deal with him.

32:49.518 --> 32:51.718
You all run for the woods,

32:51.753 --> 32:53.653
And I'll go along the tracks.

32:53.688 --> 32:56.022
And try to free as many
of the others as I can.

32:58.860 --> 33:01.461
Let's get started then.

33:03.465 --> 33:05.665
My name is charles stein.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.667
I study biology.

33:07.702 --> 33:09.836
At the sorbonne.

33:09.871 --> 33:13.206
<i>My name is georges mandelbaum.
I'm a dentist.</i>

33:13.241 --> 33:16.342
<i>I have a twin brother louis,
but I haven't seen him.</i>

33:16.378 --> 33:18.778
<i>Since the roundup.
My name is jonathan collard.</i>

33:18.813 --> 33:21.214
<i>My wife and I had just opened
a cafÃ© in the marais.</i>

33:21.249 --> 33:23.216
<i>I'm teaching my son
everything I know.</i>

33:23.251 --> 33:26.252
<i>As a plumber, so that
after the war, he can take over.</i>

33:26.288 --> 33:29.422
<i>My business and help rebuild.
I am a drummer. Jazz mostly.</i>

33:29.457 --> 33:32.725
<i>I have a cousin in america
who plays with nat king cole,</i>

33:32.761 --> 33:34.060
<i>And he says he can get me.</i>

33:34.095 --> 33:36.396
<i>A gig with him.
15 years I was police officer.</i>

33:36.431 --> 33:39.966
<i>I told them I've never even been
to temple, but then they wanted.</i>

33:40.001 --> 33:42.135
<i>To set an example.
A few days ago, I was out.</i>

33:42.170 --> 33:44.938
<i>Trying to sell
what little we had left.</i>

33:44.973 --> 33:47.073
<i>When I returned,
they had taken my wife.</i>

33:47.108 --> 33:49.976
<i>I never got to say good-bye.</i>

33:57.752 --> 33:59.552
Fire! The train is on fire!

33:59.588 --> 34:02.388
Stop the train! Please!
We're on fire!

34:05.160 --> 34:07.560
Stop the train! Open the doors!

34:10.799 --> 34:12.864
Fire!

34:12.900 --> 34:14.900
Stop the train!

34:29.351 --> 34:32.150
<i>Eryk mlynarczyk.</i>

34:32.187 --> 34:35.288
<i>I was a baker in a small village
just outside of wroclaw.</i>

34:35.322 --> 34:37.290
<i>But my younger sister,
I don't know.</i>

34:37.324 --> 34:40.326
<i>Where they've taken her.
I am yitzhak lieberman, 33,</i>

34:40.362 --> 34:42.428
<i>Cook from tylice.</i>

34:42.464 --> 34:44.664
<i>I live there
with my wife, laila,</i>

34:44.699 --> 34:47.867
<i>And our daughter, maya.
Karl berkovitch.</i>

34:47.902 --> 34:49.969
<i>This is my father samuel.</i>

34:50.005 --> 34:52.304
<i>We're both tailors.
We moved to paris last month.</i>

34:52.340 --> 34:55.275
<i>Everyone in my family
left when the nazis arrived,</i>

34:55.310 --> 34:57.610
<i>But my father
was too sick to travel, so</i>

34:57.646 --> 35:00.913
<i>I stayed behind to take care...
I was separated from my family.</i>

35:00.949 --> 35:03.349
<i>At the vel' d'hiv'.
My wife's name.</i>

35:03.385 --> 35:06.819
<i>Is miriam.
My daughter is catherine.</i>

35:06.855 --> 35:09.989
<i>The last time I saw her, she had
a pink ribbon in her hair.</i>

35:10.025 --> 35:12.725
<i>I saved six months to get.</i>

35:12.761 --> 35:14.727
<i>A ticket to switzerland,
but then they said.</i>

35:14.763 --> 35:17.297
<i>The borders were closed.</i>

35:17.332 --> 35:22.535
<i>My name is henri meyerson.
I was born and raised in paris,</i>

35:22.570 --> 35:24.570
<i>And my wife, gertie,
passed away soon after.</i>

35:24.606 --> 35:28.474
<i>Our son was born. I owned
a small bookshop in the marais.</i>

35:28.510 --> 35:32.078
<i>It wasn't much, but it was
enough for me and benjamin.</i>

35:32.113 --> 35:35.248
<i>I often wonder what benjamin
will become later in life.</i>

35:35.283 --> 35:38.584
<i>I always hoped
he would take over the shop.</i>

35:38.620 --> 35:41.587
<i>Perhaps he'll start his own.
They're getting away!</i>

35:41.623 --> 35:45.258
<i>Now, my only purpose is to make sure
he can one day make that choice.</i>

36:04.446 --> 36:06.913
Alfred! Run!

36:06.948 --> 36:08.881
Alfred, run!

36:08.917 --> 36:12.051
Hey! Come on! Run!

36:12.087 --> 36:14.053
Get some water! Fire.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.255
In car four! Come on!

36:16.291 --> 36:18.257
Don't let them go!

36:49.916 --> 36:51.016
Harry?

36:52.686 --> 36:54.085
Harry!

36:57.824 --> 36:59.624
Go! Go!

36:59.660 --> 37:01.359
They're getting away!

37:03.530 --> 37:05.130
Come on!

37:05.165 --> 37:07.465
Stop now! Hands in the air!

37:15.342 --> 37:18.410
There. Give me a hand.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.912
Let's go. Let's go!

37:20.947 --> 37:22.547
Come on!

37:31.458 --> 37:33.625
We'll arrive in pruszko
in a few minutes.

37:35.495 --> 37:37.295
Thank you.

37:46.406 --> 37:48.840
Don't you touch me!
I'm sorry. I...

37:48.875 --> 37:52.310
How could you? First,
you pretend to be franz's wife,

37:52.346 --> 37:54.312
And then you offer him up
to the resistance?

37:54.348 --> 37:56.948
I was only trying to...
What's wrong with you?!

37:56.983 --> 37:58.883
You have some nerve.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.954
Franz was about to be shot.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.357
In the head.

38:05.392 --> 38:07.692
Helene not only saved his life,
but, in all likelihood,

38:07.728 --> 38:09.828
Saved ours as well.

38:09.863 --> 38:12.464
You can be angry
about what happened,

38:12.499 --> 38:15.066
But don't blame the one person
you should be thanking.

38:21.675 --> 38:23.708
There was no need...
Yes there was.

38:23.744 --> 38:25.844
She is a german; We are at war.

38:25.879 --> 38:27.979
This is not personal.

38:28.014 --> 38:31.349
Must feel that way to her.

38:31.385 --> 38:35.220
Can i... Ask you a question?

38:35.255 --> 38:37.222
Of course.

38:37.257 --> 38:40.024
Do all women working in poland
carry a gun?

38:40.060 --> 38:43.161
Only some of us.

38:43.196 --> 38:46.564
I told you,
we are pioneers of sorts.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.834
Poland is the frontier,
and, as we've just seen,

38:49.870 --> 38:51.836
There are risks.

38:51.872 --> 38:55.540
But it must take
a very special kind of woman.

38:55.575 --> 38:57.776
To handle it all. Yes.

38:57.811 --> 38:59.778
And judging by the way
you handled yourself.

38:59.813 --> 39:02.247
With those animals,
you'd fit right in.

39:02.282 --> 39:04.783
<i>Thank you. Pruszko station.</i>

39:04.818 --> 39:07.619
<i>Arriving at pruszko!
Pruszko station!</i>

39:07.654 --> 39:09.921
Actually,
I'm offering you a job.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.490
A job?

39:12.526 --> 39:15.393
We are short-staffed,
and someone.

39:15.429 --> 39:17.495
With your courage, well,

39:17.531 --> 39:19.931
It's worth its weight
in gold out here.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.233
I'd like you as my associate.

39:22.269 --> 39:24.169
At race and resettlement,

39:24.204 --> 39:26.204
Starting immediately.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.306
Well, I'm...

39:28.341 --> 39:31.743
I'm flattered,
but can I think about it?

39:31.778 --> 39:35.280
You don't have to.
I'll take you to a hotel.

39:35.315 --> 39:37.715
We use, and you can
start at the office

39:37.751 --> 39:40.351
9 a.M. Sharp.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.854
We're going to take you
all back to our camp.

40:23.063 --> 40:27.165
Let's go.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.200
We have to go.

40:45.519 --> 40:47.852
Dammit!

40:59.900 --> 41:01.633
Still no word from harry?

41:01.668 --> 41:03.635
No, sir.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.870
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
'til I know they're safe.

41:09.109 --> 41:11.142
It's my fault
that they were on that train.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.578
Sir? Frommer was supposed.

41:13.613 --> 41:15.894
To take care of it, but then
I told him what had happened.

41:17.384 --> 41:18.449
Why?

41:20.153 --> 41:22.587
I couldn't lie.

41:22.622 --> 41:24.889
If it was william,
I would have wanted to know.

41:24.925 --> 41:26.858
I put that team.

41:26.893 --> 41:28.860
At risk because I was... selfish.

41:31.231 --> 41:33.464
I'm not sure
what I'd do without you.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.034
Krystina, I rely on you.
I trust your judgment.

41:36.069 --> 41:39.070
But by keeping you here, I'm depriving
the war effort of an agent.

41:39.105 --> 41:42.407
With the skill and the courage
needed for us to win.

41:42.442 --> 41:45.209
The next operational team
that goes out, you're in.

41:45.245 --> 41:47.545
I won't let you down.

41:47.581 --> 41:49.647
I know.

42:10.170 --> 42:12.136
I heard gunshots.

42:12.172 --> 42:14.138
Train car of prisoners
headed for the camps.

42:14.174 --> 42:16.407
They broke out
and made a run for it.

42:16.443 --> 42:19.544
These are some of the survivors.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.779
And you? We lost three men,

42:21.815 --> 42:23.881
But we did land a prize.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.751
An officer? Even better.

42:28.922 --> 42:31.489
<i>Brigadefuhrer.</i>

42:32.305 --> 42:38.613
