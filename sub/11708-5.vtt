18:47.835 --> 18:50.420
{\an8}- WE DON'T NEED PETS.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.839
{\an8}- I'LL JUST PUT
YOUR SHORTS OVER IT.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.383
{\an8}THEN IT WON'T SMELL
LIKE PISS.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.051
{\an8}I'M GOING TO PLAY.

19:02.307 --> 19:06.144
{\an8}GYM, TAN, I NEED
SOME FUCKING CLEARASIL.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.743
{\an8}- STOP IT.
I LOVE YOU TOO.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.788
{\an8}I GOT TO GIVE YOU A HUG
FOR GETTING MY BACK, KID.

19:24.872 --> 19:25.873
{\an8}- UHH!

{\an8}- FOR MANNING UP
AND FUCKING GETTING MY BACK.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.625
{\an8}- FOR WHAT?

19:28.709 --> 19:29.793
{\an8}- JUST TELL WHAT'S UP
AND TELL ME

19:29.877 --> 19:31.128
{\an8}THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GOT MY BACK.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.087
{\an8}- NO, YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT'S UP IN THE HOUSE.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.172
{\an8}- I KNOW WHAT'S UP, GIRL.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.256
{\an8}- EVERYONE'S TALKING
ABOUT ME.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.759
{\an8}- YOUR GIRL DISAPPEARED.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.262
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN NICE AS HELL
TO EVERYBODY THIS YEAR.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.805
{\an8}- MIKE, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.140
{\an8}REMEMBER?
"I LIKE BEING THE VILLAIN."

19:43.223 --> 19:46.727
{\an8}SO HOW THE FUCK DO WE
FUCKING TRUST YOU?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.687
{\an8}- WHY DOES EVERYBODY
GOT TO FOCUS ON MIKE?

19:48.770 --> 19:50.397
{\an8}MIKE, MIKE, MIKE.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.149
{\an8}- BECAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY PANTS.
- WILL YOU TURN AROUND?

19:52.232 --> 19:54.067
{\an8}- YOU'RE CRAZY.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.777
{\an8}- YOU'RE BEING CRAZY.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.070
{\an8}I WILL ADMIT THAT.
- I'M BEING HONEST.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.031
{\an8}DO YOU WANT ME
TO BE HONEST?

19:59.114 --> 20:00.616
{\an8}- I'M WALKING UP
TO THE PARTY DECK,

20:00.699 --> 20:01.575
{\an8}LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.620
{\an8}OH, MY GOD.
YOUR DRAWERS ARE DOWN.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.164
{\an8}- I HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY BOLD,
BOLD, BOLD PERSONALITY.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.791
{\an8}- SO DO I.
- I DON'T BOTHER ANYBODY.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.836
{\an8}- ALL I SEE IS MIKE'S PANTS
UNZIPPED,

20:12.920 --> 20:14.421
{\an8}AND HIS WIENER JUST, LIKE,
BARELY HANGING OUT,

20:14.504 --> 20:16.590
{\an8}AND I'M JUST LIKE,
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

20:16.673 --> 20:20.552
{\an8}- THERE'S NO REASON TO, LIKE,
BE MEAN TO ME OR ANYTHING.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.638
{\an8}I-I TRY TO BE NICE
TO EVERYBODY.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.306
{\an8}I'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING HARD
IN JERSEY.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.390
{\an8}- NO, I KNOW YOU HAVE.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.475
{\an8}- AND EVERYBODY THINKS
I HAVE, LIKE,

20:26.558 --> 20:27.476
{\an8}HIDDEN AGENDAS AND SHIT.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.810
{\an8}IT'S NOT TRUE.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.105
{\an8}I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO BE NICE
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON

20:32.189 --> 20:33.774
{\an8}IN A DIFFERENT WAY
EVERY DAY.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.317
{\an8}I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.652
{\an8}- YO, I SWEAR TO GOD,

20:36.735 --> 20:37.361
{\an8}THAT THING'S TALKING TO ME
RIGHT NOW, BRO.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.779
{\an8}- I KNOW. I CAN'T LOOK.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.240
{\an8}THIS IS WHY I'M, LIKE, WEIRDED
OUT AND STARING AT RONNIE.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.158
{\an8}- MIKE IS JUST FUCKED UP
RIGHT NOW

20:43.241 --> 20:44.826
{\an8}AND DOESN'T EVEN REALIZE
THAT HIS DICK IS OUT.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.830
{\an8}- I'M TRYING NOT TO TURN AROUND.
I KEEP LOOKING AT IT.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.666
{\an8}I'M EYE LEVEL
WITH IT RIGHT NOW.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.043
{\an8}- YOU GUYS TREAT ME LIKE--
IT ACTUALLY UPSETS ME, LIKE,

20:53.126 --> 20:54.836
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

20:54.920 --> 20:55.879
{\an8}AND I JUST FEEL
THAT SOME OF Y'ALL,

20:55.963 --> 20:57.422
{\an8}LIKE, EITHER, "A,"
DON'T BELIEVE ME,

20:57.506 --> 20:59.925
{\an8}OR "B," THINK I GOT SOMETHING,
LIKE I'M A TERRORIST,

21:00.008 --> 21:01.176
{\an8}LIKE I'M PLANNING

21:01.259 --> 21:04.012
{\an8}LIKE, YO, RONNIE TODAY,
HE SAID,

21:04.096 --> 21:05.514
{\an8}"MIKE IS BEING
EXTRA-SPECIAL NICE,

21:05.597 --> 21:06.306
{\an8}"BUT HE'S PLANNING
SOMETHING.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.558
{\an8}HE'S, LIKE, A TERRORIST."

21:08.642 --> 21:11.687
{\an8}I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE,
I'M JUST BEING REAL.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.355
{\an8}YOU GUYS ARE MY BROTHERS
AND SISTERS,

21:13.438 --> 21:15.273
{\an8}AND LIKE, UH,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING,

21:15.357 --> 21:18.485
{\an8}ANYTHING I DO AT ANY TIME,
PLEASE TELL ME.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.195
{\an8}I'LL FIX IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

21:20.278 --> 21:21.113
{\an8}LIKE, PLEASE.
- I HEAR YOU.

21:21.196 --> 21:24.241
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, DUDE.
ALL RIGHT.

21:24.324 --> 21:27.536
{\an8}- I'M, LIKE, MIND-FUCKED

21:27.619 --> 21:29.162
{\an8}ACTUALLY, LIKE,
SET MIKE OFF LIKE THAT.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.665
{\an8}LIKE, IT'S A FUCKING JOKE,
MIKE.

21:31.748 --> 21:35.377
{\an8}- YO, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT,
BRAH?

21:35.460 --> 21:38.255
{\an8}- THERE'S NOTHING I COULD--
ELSE I COULD DO.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.048
{\an8}SNOOKS.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.883
{\an8}LIKE, THERE'S--THERE'S ACTUALLY
NOTHING ELSE I COULD DO.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.094
{\an8}LIKE, I COULD--

21:44.177 --> 21:45.220
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD SAY
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.555
{\an8}- I CONFRONTED EVERY
SINGLE PERSON OUTSIDE,

21:46.638 --> 21:47.556
{\an8}AND EVERYBODY SAID
EVERYTHING'S COOL.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.392
{\an8}SO THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
I CAN DO,

21:50.475 --> 21:51.393
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

21:51.476 --> 21:52.561
{\an8}COME WITH ME.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.063
{\an8}I-I NEED TO--I NEED TO--
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
GO OUT THE OTHER WAY.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.107
{\an8}GO OUT THAT WAY.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.735
{\an8}LIKE, I TOLD EVERYBODY,
I SAID,

21:59.818 --> 22:00.694
{\an8}"PLEASE,"
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

22:00.777 --> 22:01.987

22:03.739 --> 22:05.824
{\an8}PLEASE TELL ME."

22:05.907 --> 22:06.950
{\an8}- BUT YOU TOLD ME
PAULY'S BEING FAKE,

22:07.034 --> 22:08.410
{\an8}SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL PAULY OUT?

22:08.493 --> 22:09.953
{\an8}- NO, I JUST WENT UP TO HIM
JUST NOW AND I'M LIKE--

22:10.037 --> 22:11.788
{\an8}BUT I DIDN'T SINGLE HIM OUT.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.874
{\an8}- SAY WHAT YOU REALLY FEEL,
YOU IDIOT.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.125
{\an8}- I CAN'T ACCUSE PEOPLE BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.209
{\an8}- DON'T ACCUSE PEOPLE.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.170
{\an8}JUST SAY,
"THIS IS HOW I FEEL.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.671
{\an8}WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON?"

22:19.755 --> 22:26.094
{\an8}- LISTEN, IT'S EITHER
I'M 100% NICE OR 100% MEAN.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.929
{\an8}- NO SHIT.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.222
{\an8}- NO SHIT.
I KNOW THAT.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.392
{\an8}- SO I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE
ARE NOT ACCEPTING ME BEING NICE,

22:32.476 --> 22:33.935
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

22:34.019 --> 22:34.936
{\an8}AND IT'S--IT'S UPSETTING ME.
- WE DON'T TRUST YOU.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.522
{\an8}THAT'S IT.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.608
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE
IT'S TIME TO BE BAD.

22:39.691 --> 22:43.445
{\an8}IT'S TIME FOR ME TO STAND UP
AND CONFRONT PEOPLE.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.782
{\an8}PRESS *69, 'CAUSE YOU--
I-I WANT TO RE--

22:46.865 --> 22:48.784

THAT I AM GOING TO DO--

38:08.536 --> 38:09.370
{\an8}- I'M APOLOGIZING NOW.
- I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE--

38:09.453 --> 38:11.747
{\an8}- AND APOLOGIZE LATER.
- [laughs]

38:11.831 --> 38:13.374
{\an8}- I WAS LIKE, "YO, YOU GOT TO BE
UP TO SOMETHING, BRAH.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.750
{\an8}IT'S LIKE, YOU'VE BEEN
WAY TOO NICE."

38:14.834 --> 38:16.210
{\an8}I'M LIKE,
"YOU'RE LIKE A TERRORIST."

38:16.293 --> 38:17.962
{\an8}- PLOTTING AND SHIT.
- YOU'RE PLOTTING SOMETHING.

38:18.045 --> 38:21.298
{\an8}BUT I WAS JUST JOKING, AND HE
TOOK IT SO SERIOUS, BRO.

38:21.382 --> 38:25.428
{\an8}♪ ♪

38:27.471 --> 38:29.890
{\an8}- WHAT UP, SIR?
- WHAT UP? HOW WAS WORK?

38:29.974 --> 38:31.809
{\an8}- EH, IT WAS ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

38:31.892 --> 38:33.561
{\an8}- HOW WAS GYM?
- YEAH, GOOD.

38:33.644 --> 38:34.979
{\an8}- MY BAD, BUDDY.

38:35.062 --> 38:36.647
{\an8}I THINK SOMEBODY WAS
JUST TRYING TO STIR THE POT,

38:36.731 --> 38:37.481
{\an8}SO I APOLOGIZE.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.317
{\an8}- MIKE IS LIKE
A BROKEN RECORD.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.985
{\an8}HE STICKS TO, LIKE,
ONE TOPIC A DAY.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.778
{\an8}SO HE'S ALWAYS
APOLOGETIC ONE DAY

38:42.862 --> 38:44.113
{\an8}AND HE'LL STICK TO THAT
ALL DAY.

38:44.196 --> 38:45.406
{\an8}TOMORROW, IT'LL BE
A NEW FRICKIN' THING

38:45.489 --> 38:46.574
{\an8}AND HE'LL STICK TO IT
ALL DAY,

38:46.657 --> 38:47.783
{\an8}WHETHER HE'S HOOKING UP
WITH A CHICK,

38:47.867 --> 38:49.076
{\an8}YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IT
THE WHOLE DAY.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.370
{\an8}- AND I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S UP,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

38:51.454 --> 38:52.747
{\an8}SOMEBODY WAS JUST TRYING TO
CAUSE A LITTLE TROUBLE.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.915
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.375
{\an8}- I KNOW THE--
I KNOW THE DEAL NOW,

38:56.459 --> 38:57.585
{\an8}AND I'M GONNA
HAVE TO FIX IT, YOU KNOW?

38:57.668 --> 38:58.794
{\an8}- GOOD.

38:58.878 --> 38:59.920
{\an8}- IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE GUYS.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.589
{\an8}- YEAH, YEAH,
NO, I FIGURED THAT.

39:01.672 --> 39:02.923
{\an8}I FIGURED THAT.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.258
{\an8}- WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
FINDING OUT

39:04.341 --> 39:08.596
{\an8}WHO THE REAL TROUBLEMAKER IS,
AND, UM, IT'S SNOOKI.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.766
{\an8}THEY WERE DOING IT
FOR THEIR BENEFIT, SO--

39:11.849 --> 39:13.392
{\an8}SO THAT I DON'T SAY
ANYTHING,

39:13.476 --> 39:15.311
{\an8}LIKE, TO HER, LIKE,
JIONNI.

39:15.394 --> 39:19.106
{\an8}- AH. MM-HMM.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.941
{\an8}- BUT NOW--
NOW IT'S ON NOW.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.151
{\an8}FIRST TIME I SEE HIM.

39:22.234 --> 39:23.819
{\an8}- WELL, I'M GLAD
THAT YOU REALIZE.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.113
{\an8}- SOMEBODY GET FUCKED UP.
IT'S REALLY FUCKED UP.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.365
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

39:28.449 --> 39:31.118
{\an8}- THE WHOLE MORNING
MIKE IS SAYING, YOU KNOW,

39:31.202 --> 39:31.869
{\an8}"I DON'T HAVE ULTERIOR MOTIVES
FOR DOING ANYTHING.

39:31.952 --> 39:34.121
{\an8}I'M A NICE GUY."

39:34.205 --> 39:36.999
{\an8}AND AT THIS MOMENT,
MIKE IS PLANNING ON RETALIATING

39:37.083 --> 39:38.501
{\an8}AGAINST SNOOKI
AND GETTING HER BACK

39:38.584 --> 39:40.878
{\an8}AND TELLING JIONNI SOME,
LIKE, DEEP, DARK SECRETS.

39:40.961 --> 39:45.257
{\an8}- WAIT TILL I SEE HIM.

39:45.341 --> 39:49.386
{\an8}I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT FUCKING
BLINDSIDED LIKE THAT BY HER.

39:53.432 --> 39:55.935
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA LET UNIT KNOW
TO CALL JIONNI

39:56.018 --> 39:57.520
{\an8}OR SET JIONNI UP SOMEHOW.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.563
{\an8}- YO. WHAT'S UP, BRO?
- WHAT UP, PIMP?

39:59.647 --> 40:00.648
{\an8}- LIKE, THE REAL MIKE
IS BACK,

40:00.731 --> 40:02.900
{\an8}AND I LOVE WATCHING
ALL THE SHIT HE DOES.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.485
{\an8}I GOT MY POPCORN READY.
LET'S GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.822
{\an8}- COME DOWN, UH,
AND UNTANGLE THE BUSINESS

40:07.905 --> 40:10.324
{\an8}THAT WAS, UH, UNFINISHED.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.495
{\an8}- BUT EVERYTHING WAS OKAY?

40:14.578 --> 40:15.955
{\an8}- EVERYTHING WAS
ACTUALLY NICE,

40:16.038 --> 40:18.541
{\an8}BUT THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SOMETHING HAPPENED YESTERDAY

40:18.624 --> 40:20.292
{\an8}AND YOU START WITH ME
AND, YOU KNOW,

40:20.376 --> 40:21.627
{\an8}I'M GONNA FINISH IT,
YOU KNOW?

40:21.710 --> 40:23.295
{\an8}I'M KIND OF IN THE MOOD
FOR A LITTLE TROUBLE.

40:23.379 --> 40:23.921
{\an8}- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- DEANNA.

40:24.004 --> 40:26.132
{\an8}- I'M VINNY.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.592
{\an8}I KNOW THAT DEANNA IS PROBABLY
A SURE THING,

40:28.676 --> 40:29.927
{\an8}BUT THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER GIRL
THAT'S, LIKE, REALLY HOT.

40:30.010 --> 40:35.307
{\an8}BUT DEENA IS KEEPING THE GIRL
DEANNA ON THE BACKBURNER.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.809
{\an8}- SO ARE YOU DTF?

40:36.892 --> 40:38.602
{\an8}- DTF?
- YEAH.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.854
{\an8}- LIKE, IT'S ALWAYS
GLOOM AND DOOM

40:39.937 --> 40:41.147
{\an8}AND DRAMA WITH YOU.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.483
{\an8}- YOU CAN'T MAKE IT,
THAT'S ON YOU. I TRIED.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.277
{\an8}I GOT UP, I'M DRESSED,
AND I'M FUCKING READY.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.362
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I KNOW
WHERE I STAND,

40:48.445 --> 40:50.030
{\an8}AND THEREFORE,
HE CAN GO FUCK HIMSELF.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.867
{\an8}[muttering]
