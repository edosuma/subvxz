00:37.037 --> 00:38.455
This week...

00:38.538 --> 00:39.956
my son became a man.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.459
When am I a man?

00:43.918 --> 00:44.753
Aviram...

00:45.420 --> 00:46.504
Please recite the blessing.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.696
You can't catch me, Aviram...

01:11.780 --> 01:13.198
Hey, get away from the street!

01:14.991 --> 01:16.367
I'm too fast for you...!

01:17.202 --> 01:19.496
You're not a man, you're a turtle...

01:20.622 --> 01:22.123
Aviram, no!

01:23.708 --> 01:25.126
That's enough!

01:26.252 --> 01:29.756
-We're just playing, Mamma!
-That's how it starts.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.928
Come back here!

01:35.970 --> 01:37.430
Come back here now!

02:29.816 --> 02:31.192
<i>Enjoying your holiday?</i>

02:35.488 --> 02:36.573
Found me.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.283
<i>Of course we did.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:40.076
You're in deep shit, Avi.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.662
<i>I'm used to it.</i>

02:44.831 --> 02:46.416
You missed your hearing.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.836
Is that why you're calling,
to tell me I'm out of a job?

02:49.919 --> 02:50.962
I  already knew that.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.464
I'm calling you because I'm a good boss.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.719
Right.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.388
I'm offering you a way back in.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.017
<i>Why?</i>

03:04.976 --> 03:06.728
You're in America. It's convenient.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.024
<i>It's a way to get your life back.</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:15.695
Aviram?

03:23.411 --> 03:24.579
I'm listening.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.374
The Palestinian people
have suffered for too long.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.377
I call on everyone,
everywhere in the world...

03:33.880 --> 03:35.632
I call on everyone...

03:36.716 --> 03:39.677
who recognizes Israel...

03:40.345 --> 03:42.972
who recognizes Israel...

03:44.307 --> 03:46.726
to also recognize
the State of Palestine...

03:48.603 --> 03:50.021
to also recognize...

03:50.146 --> 03:51.397
the State of Palestine.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.193
Why can't someone else do this?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.654
If there was someone else,
I would not have asked you.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.822
But I can't remember these words.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.699
When I begin speaking, they disappear.

04:01.783 --> 04:02.784
They will come.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.119
You know them here...

04:05.662 --> 04:07.288
now you have to know them here.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.877
This is where faith comes from.

04:13.461 --> 04:17.048
You must believe you can speak the words.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.425
They will come when you need them.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.970
God will provide.

04:22.053 --> 04:26.391
Remember, my son, this is not for you
or for me but for our people.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.644
What you say is important
and will be heard by many.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.105
Have faith...

04:37.527 --> 04:40.113
who recognizes Israel...

04:42.532 --> 04:44.867
O you who have believed,

04:49.372 --> 04:50.832
what is the matter with you

04:50.915 --> 04:53.293
that, when you are told to go forth
in the cause of God,

04:55.336 --> 04:57.463
you adhere heavily to the earth?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.802
Are you satisfied
with the life of this world

05:04.095 --> 05:05.471
rather than the Hereafter?

33:09.529 --> 33:11.322
Tell Ellie I'm coming home.

33:17.954 --> 33:22.208
O you who have believed,

33:22.709 --> 33:26.254
what is the matter with you

33:26.337 --> 33:30.633
that, when you are told to go forth
in the cause of God,

33:30.717 --> 33:34.345
you adhere heavily to the earth?

33:35.847 --> 33:40.351
Are you satisfied
with the life of this world

33:40.560 --> 33:43.438
rather than the Hereafter?

33:50.361 --> 33:51.654
Do you have doubt, Samer?

33:55.533 --> 33:57.702
I believe with all my heart.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.704
I'm proud of you.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.915
You are a true disciple of God.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.503
<i>In an impressive show of solidarity...</i>

42:28.462 --> 42:30.631
<i>a crowd of many hundreds</i>
<i>are gathering at...</i>

42:30.714 --> 42:34.718
<i>the Ramallah Grand Mosque</i>
<i>this morning to hear...</i>

42:35.928 --> 42:39.848
<i>Palestinian activist</i>
<i>Jibril Hassan speak publicly...</i>

42:40.432 --> 42:44.144
<i>for the first time.</i>

42:45.896 --> 42:48.190
<i>The event has drawn the attention...</i>

42:48.274 --> 42:53.696
<i>of many political groups in Palestine...</i>

42:55.990 --> 42:57.533
<i>as many wonder...</i>

42:59.076 --> 43:02.913
<i>where the young activist's</i>
<i>political leanings lie.</i>

43:11.755 --> 43:14.633
The Palestinian people
have suffered for too long.

43:15.884 --> 43:17.136
Ignore them.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.470
Be at peace.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.306
Try again.

45:15.129 --> 45:15.963
Samer.

46:39.755 --> 46:41.632
Everything is going to be alright.

46:41.715 --> 46:43.175
They need you.

46:44.176 --> 46:45.552
They believe in you.

46:46.136 --> 46:47.054
Come.

46:54.478 --> 46:55.854
I'm not ready.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.899
And now you will walk with God.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.069
Your name will live on.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.875
I can't remember my words...

48:48.008 --> 48:50.427
I came across the desert with al-Masih...

48:52.804 --> 48:54.723
we suffered many hardships.

49:14.368 --> 49:16.328
But what I learned from him...

49:17.287 --> 49:19.289
was that we are all one people.

49:33.261 --> 49:35.097
<i>...all men and women...</i>

49:35.973 --> 49:37.975
from everywhere.

49:41.603 --> 49:43.605
I want to share a message
of  peace and unity...

49:46.483 --> 49:48.193
If you look for truth...

49:49.236 --> 49:50.696
you may find comfort.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.490
If you look for comfort...

50:49.129 --> 50:50.297
Jibril...

50:54.593 --> 50:55.552
Samer...

51:26.249 --> 51:27.626
God is greater...
