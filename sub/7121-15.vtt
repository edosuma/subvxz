Whatever.

Oh!

01:06.275 --> 01:07.527
Ohh.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.609
Oh.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.120
What happened?

01:10.195 --> 01:12.197
Where's the deer?

01:13.448 --> 01:15.200
Paging Dr. Ice Cream.

01:15.284 --> 01:18.379
Ice cream for my mou-u-u-th!

01:20.330 --> 01:22.082
Oh, dude!

01:22.165 --> 01:23.337
I broke my stems!

01:23.417 --> 01:24.760
Hello?

01:24.835 --> 01:25.677
Jake?

01:25.752 --> 01:27.425
Princess?

01:27.504 --> 01:28.721
What the bliz?

01:28.797 --> 01:30.174
Come on, people.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.320
Yo!

01:44.396 --> 01:47.616
Is everyone at church,
worshipping glob?

01:47.691 --> 01:48.738
Whoop!

01:50.485 --> 01:52.112
Skills. Skills.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.032
Huh?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.959
Bazoobs.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.162
Jake?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.087
Huh?

02:01.163 --> 02:02.460
Oh, Finn, you're awake!

02:02.539 --> 02:05.042
Yeah, I'm awake, but my
jams are all busted.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.126
Right.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.461
Yeah, I saw that.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.761
So, what happened?

02:08.836 --> 02:09.883
Did you save everybody?

02:09.963 --> 02:10.758
Oh, yeah.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.056
I-I think so.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.054
Maybe.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.352
So, Jake, there's nobody here.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.519
Did you notice that?

02:16.595 --> 02:17.938
Yeah. Pretty freaky.

02:18.013 --> 02:18.855
Don't worry.

02:18.930 --> 02:19.772
Ouch!

02:19.848 --> 02:20.895
They're all hiding.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.147
From what?

02:23.226 --> 02:24.068
From me.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.191
What?!

02:25.270 --> 02:26.613
It's my birthday, man.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.612
Lady Rainicorn put together
an elaborate surprise party.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.908
She told you?

02:30.984 --> 02:33.362
No, but I know Lady Rainicorn.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.697
Ouch!

02:34.780 --> 02:37.124
This is totally
something she would do.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.496
Think about it.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.169
Oh, yeah. Okay.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.087
So, wait, the whole
kingdom is in on it'?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.211
Yes, and they'll
only come out if

02:45.290 --> 02:46.917
they think we'll be surprised,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.594
so we got to act like we're
totally unaware, okay'?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.887
Okay, man.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.179
And how do we do that?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.598
Just do what I'm doing.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.642
Oh, look at me.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.015
Living free without a
suspicion in the world.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.893
Never in my wildest dreams would

02:59.971 --> 03:04.693
I guess someone was planning a
surprise birthday party for me.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.941
Pretty tricky, right?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.397
Come on, let's go
back to the hut.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.322
The what?

03:09.398 --> 03:10.900

03:21.201 --> 03:22.248
Whoa.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.045
Where'd you find
time to build this?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.213
I don't know.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.288
It didn't take long.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.004
Hmm.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.380
So, what should I do now?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.087
Collect branches for
the hobo fire, dude.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.170
Okay-

03:35.048 --> 03:36.550
Ouchies.

03:36.633 --> 03:41.685
A hobo fire, fire, fire.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.185
Boy, it sure is
quiet around here!

03:43.265 --> 03:45.267
Uh-huh!

03:45.350 --> 03:48.274
I'd probably pee all over myself
if somebody jumped out and

03:48.353 --> 03:49.400
surprised me!

03:51.064 --> 03:53.408
Oh! Oh, I stink!

03:53.483 --> 03:54.655
How long was I out for?

03:54.735 --> 03:55.987
A day or two?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.161
Huh.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.205
What a convenient
place to bathe.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.994
Sure seems like a good time
to come out if y'all are just

04:03.076 --> 04:06.751
hiding and you don't, you know,
want to see me pop my top!

04:09.791 --> 04:11.589
Oh, yeah. That's fresh.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.423
I hope nobody's gonna jump out
of the bushes and peeps my bod!

04:15.505 --> 04:17.428
Heh heh heh heh!

04:17.507 --> 04:19.350
Blblblblblblblbl!

04:20.844 --> 04:22.846
Hmm.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.229
Just got to char out
the rotten parts...

04:27.309 --> 04:28.401
Good as new, man.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.319
Stay vigilant.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.190
Eat your protein.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.396
Jake?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.572
Hmm?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.901
I am starting to question your
theory about the surprise party.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.406
Shh!

04:37.486 --> 04:38.988
Don't talk so loud.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.322
They might hear you.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.907
But what if they're in trouble?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.788
What if something
happened to them?

04:43.867 --> 04:45.335
We should try looking around.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.457
No!

04:46.536 --> 04:48.083
You'll ruin my surprise party!

04:48.163 --> 04:50.291
Ow! Oh!

04:50.373 --> 04:51.625
Arsh!

04:51.708 --> 04:52.800
Dude, are you okay?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.093
Just promise me, Finn...

04:54.169 --> 04:56.171
Promise not to look around.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.803
Okay, I promise.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.635
My birthday, it's gonna be rad.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.311
Hey, it's you!

05:07.390 --> 05:09.313
Thanks for breaking my
legs, you dumb-butt.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.287
That sounds like...

05:24.366 --> 05:26.368
Candy people.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.169
Jake! Jake!

05:28.245 --> 05:29.918
Mm. What?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.476
I heard a sound coming
from the sewer.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.540
We should check it out.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.582
No, man.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.673
They'll surprise-party
me when they're ready.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.752
Be patient.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.422
I'm being patient!

05:38.505 --> 05:39.848
I waited all day, Jake!

05:39.923 --> 05:42.142
Well, I've been
waiting six months.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.685
<i>Six months.</i>

05:43.760 --> 05:47.731
<i>Six months.</i>

05:47.806 --> 05:49.808
Wait... what are you saying?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.235
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.189
Even if we have to wait...

05:55.272 --> 05:57.570
forever!

05:57.649 --> 05:59.697
Have I been asleep
for six months?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.870
Yeah, but don't worry
about it, man.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.496
Face it, Finn...

06:07.576 --> 06:08.919
Your best friend is gone.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.001
Finn?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.042
No-o-o-o!

06:15.125 --> 06:17.344
Don't ruin the surprise!

06:17.419 --> 06:19.592
Raaaaah!

06:19.671 --> 06:21.344
Gah! Aah! Aah!

06:21.423 --> 06:22.720
Whoa!

06:22.799 --> 06:23.925
Oomph!

06:24.009 --> 06:25.727
Hyah! Rah! Aah!

06:28.972 --> 06:29.972
No!

06:30.015 --> 06:31.358
Oh, my glob!

06:37.147 --> 06:39.241
Surprise!

06:39.316 --> 06:41.444
Happy birthday, Jake!

06:41.526 --> 06:43.449
Ow!

06:46.698 --> 06:49.747
Hey, Jake, what are you doing?

06:49.826 --> 06:52.079
This is how my party's
gonna go down.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.755
Shake it, my friends.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.707
Hey! Hey!

06:55.790 --> 06:57.508
Sure is great seeing
you all here.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.756
Really makes me think.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.132
Ow!

07:00.211 --> 07:02.930
Lady, did you get extra T.P.
for all the "potty" people?

07:03.006 --> 07:04.474
No.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.223
Well, we might have some
party peepers here,

07:07.302 --> 07:10.306
and I want to be sure they don't
wipe their buns on my cake.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.856
Can I join your puppet party'?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.900
We'll have twice
the puppet voices.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.477
You won't run away?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.356
Nah, man.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.436
I'm with you.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.197
Happy birthday, Jake. Really.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.444
Finn!

07:20.523 --> 07:22.571
Glad I can untie you, buddy.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.616
Check it out!

07:25.695 --> 07:28.039
Finn finally made
it to my party!

07:28.114 --> 07:30.242
And I have a surprise for you.

07:30.325 --> 07:33.044
Close your eyes and don't
open them till I tell you.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.211
Finn?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.796
You... lied to me?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.264
Yeow!

07:53.723 --> 07:55.100
What about my party?

07:55.183 --> 07:57.231
Don't go!

07:57.310 --> 07:59.904
Finn!

07:59.980 --> 08:00.980
Whupppp!

08:11.992 --> 08:13.790
Hello?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.140
Finn...

08:32.220 --> 08:37.020
A-a-a-a-a-aah!

08:37.100 --> 08:41.196
Surprise!

08:41.270 --> 08:42.488
You...

08:42.563 --> 08:43.816
you did this?

08:43.898 --> 08:44.820
I did this?

08:44.899 --> 08:46.196
Ow!

08:46.276 --> 08:49.371
They've been waiting for me, Finn...
for my b-day!

08:49.446 --> 08:50.789
Stop being crazy!

08:50.864 --> 08:52.784
Gobble gobble gobble,
bla-bla-bla, gobble, dooba,

08:52.824 --> 08:53.825
dooba, dabble.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.034
Bb-bb-bb-bb-bb-bb-bb!

08:56.036 --> 08:56.878
Oof!

08:56.953 --> 08:58.921
You a he!

08:58.997 --> 09:01.671
I'm a woman!

09:01.750 --> 09:02.592
Raah!

09:02.667 --> 09:03.463
Ooh!

09:03.543 --> 09:04.543
Ring, ring.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.133
Eh, hang on, deary.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.885
Hello?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.716
Baby, I told you never
to call me here.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.267
Oh!

09:13.970 --> 09:15.893
W-what happened?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.132
A deer scronked your head,
and you lost your mind, man.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.560
You imprisoned the candy people

09:19.642 --> 09:21.440
for your own sick
birthday fantasy.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.896
Look.

09:22.979 --> 09:23.901
What?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.027
No!

09:25.106 --> 09:27.450
It's not even close to my b-day.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.870
I'm so sorry.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.322
You...

09:32.405 --> 09:35.750
You did not do this, Jake.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.747
What?!

09:36.826 --> 09:37.748
Then who did?

09:37.827 --> 09:40.296
It... was... him.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.296
Freak deer!

09:48.379 --> 09:50.222
Aah!

09:56.429 --> 09:58.147
Jake, you free the Candy people.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.351
I'll take on the deer.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.650
No-o-o!

10:01.726 --> 10:02.978
ÂVan!

10:04.521 --> 10:05.647
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

10:05.730 --> 10:07.949
Thank you.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.947
Heh, heh, hoo, hoo, ha.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.198
Grrrrr!

10:11.277 --> 10:12.745
Oh!

10:12.821 --> 10:13.663
Aah!

10:13.738 --> 10:14.785
Ohh!

10:18.243 --> 10:19.415
Ugh!

10:19.494 --> 10:20.336
Finn!

10:20.411 --> 10:21.253
Huh?

10:21.329 --> 10:22.329
Donk!

10:34.342 --> 10:35.810
Nice!

10:35.885 --> 10:37.137
We did it, dude.
