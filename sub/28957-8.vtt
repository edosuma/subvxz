WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:04.155
Run away with me.

00:04.188 --> 00:06.157
Money for the Contras
is pouring in.

00:06.190 --> 00:07.658
You've done enough here.

00:07.691 --> 00:09.426
There are other ways to serve.

00:09.460 --> 00:10.961
Mel didn't come home last night.

00:10.994 --> 00:13.297
She stole my car,
and I found it stripped.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.132
Look, I'm hoping
that you got a better read

00:15.166 --> 00:16.733
on where she could be than I do.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.068
I'll ask around.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.736
You think Mel too good
to smoke rock?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.172
Man, what you think,
we making all this money

00:21.205 --> 00:22.239
'cause this shit
ain't addictive?

00:22.273 --> 00:23.507
Once the rock get ahold

00:23.540 --> 00:24.808
of they ass,

00:24.841 --> 00:27.110
the person you knew, they gone.

00:27.144 --> 00:28.745
-Get in the fucking...
-Damn! Damn!

00:28.779 --> 00:30.947
What the fuck is your problem,
Franklin?

00:30.981 --> 00:32.583
What happened?

00:32.616 --> 00:34.751
Is she okay?

00:34.785 --> 00:36.187
No.

00:37.321 --> 00:39.290
She on the rock now.

00:41.892 --> 00:45.429
-(lighter clicks)
-(Melody inhales)

02:53.924 --> 02:57.328
TOP NOTCH:
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you-you
see where he looking?

02:57.361 --> 03:00.230
You know, checking that window
for reflections?

03:00.263 --> 03:01.632
You know, seeing if
anyone's approaching

03:01.665 --> 03:03.266
down the opposite street?

03:03.300 --> 03:06.403
And you didn't spot any other
surveillance or support?

03:06.437 --> 03:08.839
TOP NOTCH:
No, it appears
he's working alone.

03:08.872 --> 03:10.341
So he's vulnerable.

03:10.374 --> 03:12.476
He's what we call a hard target.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.244
You know, mean he, uh...
he sleeps light,

03:14.277 --> 03:15.646
you know, with one eye open.

03:15.679 --> 03:18.081
You ain't gonna ever really
get the...

03:18.114 --> 03:19.282
get the drop on him.

03:21.685 --> 03:22.986
So, what's next?

03:23.019 --> 03:24.988
Well, I follow him.

03:25.021 --> 03:26.923
You know, bring you back
some useful intel--

03:26.957 --> 03:29.526
you know, where he lives,
you know, if he has a family,

03:29.560 --> 03:31.862
try to find his soft spots.

03:31.895 --> 03:33.864
And say you get yourself caught.

03:33.897 --> 03:35.432
(dog barking in distance)

03:35.466 --> 03:37.868
How's Reed gonna take it
we trying to follow him?

03:37.901 --> 03:39.970
TOP NOTCH:
You ain't got to worry about me.

03:40.003 --> 03:42.172
They don't call the man
Top Notch for nothing.

03:44.007 --> 03:46.543
I know it's scary,
but we need to push forward,

03:46.577 --> 03:49.279
build up leverage,
a protection plan.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.715
Protection plan, and that's it?

03:51.748 --> 03:53.350
That's the only option?

03:53.384 --> 03:57.287
No, there's one
other thing you can do:

03:57.320 --> 03:58.489
run.

03:59.556 --> 04:01.492
Cuba's your best bet these days,

04:01.525 --> 04:04.495
but, you know,

04:04.528 --> 04:08.499
once the CIA got you
in their crosshairs...

04:08.532 --> 04:10.634
Yeah?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.169
...there ain't no real cover.

04:15.071 --> 04:17.273
(helicopter whirring
in distance)

04:21.378 --> 04:23.547
(distant chatter)

04:25.549 --> 04:27.551
(keys jingling)

04:32.188 --> 04:34.190
She gone again?

04:43.934 --> 04:46.036
(lock clicks, car door opens)

04:46.069 --> 04:48.071
I'll put the word out.

04:52.275 --> 04:54.277
(car door shuts, engine starts)

05:02.753 --> 05:05.288
There's got to be a better way.

05:05.321 --> 05:07.323
There ain't.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.913
Teddy?

05:29.946 --> 05:32.082
I've been trying
to give you space, but...

05:32.115 --> 05:34.317
it's been weeks.

05:36.252 --> 05:40.390
Yeah, I can't abandon this,
you know.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.292
Not now.

05:42.325 --> 05:44.628
Besides, it's not so bad, right?

05:44.661 --> 05:48.398
Sun, surf, fighting the commies?

05:48.431 --> 05:50.634
We can fight communism
somewhere else.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.003
If Nicaragua falls,
Honduras and Guatemala are next.

05:53.036 --> 05:54.471
I'm not letting that happen.

05:54.505 --> 05:56.673
In a year, I can leave.

05:56.707 --> 05:58.709
Just give me a year.

06:00.811 --> 06:03.146
You know, hedgehogs, in winter,
when it's freezing,

06:03.179 --> 06:05.782
they huddle together
to keep warm.

06:05.816 --> 06:07.951
But then their sharp spines
prick each other,

06:07.984 --> 06:09.586
so they move apart.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.756
But then they get cold,
so they huddle together again,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.325
prick each other again,
over and over.

06:15.358 --> 06:17.327
(zipper zipping)

06:17.360 --> 06:18.962
Okay.

06:21.197 --> 06:23.800
So we're hedgehogs.
(chuckles softly)

06:23.834 --> 06:26.803
Can't be together,
can't be apart.

06:27.871 --> 06:29.339
I'm saying it feels like

06:29.372 --> 06:31.074
we've had this
conversation before.

06:42.753 --> 06:45.388
You can finish this
without me, yeah?

06:57.568 --> 07:00.236
Yeah, she'll come home
for a day or two,

07:00.270 --> 07:02.673
-say all the right things...
-(TV playing indistinctly)

07:02.706 --> 07:04.207
(sighs)

07:04.240 --> 07:07.310
Then she'll be gone again.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.680
I, uh...

07:09.713 --> 07:12.482
I can't take her to school,
not like this.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.651
-(indistinct chatter
over phone)
-(sighs)

07:14.685 --> 07:17.153
No telling what she'd do
if she was alone.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.890
WOMAN (over phone):
Why don't you both come?

07:19.923 --> 07:22.258
To Texas?

07:22.292 --> 07:24.327
Take a break from the city.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.096
Bring her to a new environment.

07:26.129 --> 07:28.331
-Hmm.
-Give her a clean slate.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.867
Well, no, I never really
thought of that before.

07:30.901 --> 07:32.836
(indistinct chatter over phone)

07:32.869 --> 07:34.938
You sure it wouldn't be
putting you out?

07:34.971 --> 07:36.973
(indistinct chatter over phone)

07:40.811 --> 07:43.546
Well, I am still suspended
from my job, so...

07:43.580 --> 07:46.883
(knocking on door)

07:46.917 --> 07:50.520
I'll have to think about it.
Hey, let me, uh, call you back.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.788
(indistinct chatter over phone)

07:51.822 --> 07:53.924
All right, love you, sis.

08:01.598 --> 08:04.100
-Andre Wright?
-Yeah?

08:04.134 --> 08:06.236
My name's Kate Miller.

08:06.269 --> 08:08.538
Do you have a few minutes?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.540
Few minutes for what?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.375
I believe we can
help each other.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.978
My agency's knee-deep
in a highly sensitive op,

08:15.011 --> 08:18.381
and I came across your name
during prep.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.216
I'm sorry, what agency?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.885
And how did you get my address?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.453
Detective Han gave it to me.

08:23.486 --> 08:25.221
(whispers):
Detective Han...

08:25.255 --> 08:30.093
He's the LAPD'S liaison
to the FBI, DEA, CIA.

08:30.126 --> 08:33.563
We're running at
a Colombian drug cartel.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.565
But you know what it's like
working for

08:35.598 --> 08:37.400
a government bureaucracy.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.837
Higher-ups only want to go after
the head honchos.

08:40.871 --> 08:43.239
Makes for a better
news conference.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.409
But it's the smaller guys
that need to be taken down.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.845
Look, you know, I appreciate you
coming all this way,

08:48.879 --> 08:50.781
but... got a lot of shit
going on, so...

08:50.814 --> 08:52.482
The ones doing damage
right here,

08:52.515 --> 08:56.386
in our neighborhoods--
dealers like Franklin Saint.

08:58.822 --> 09:00.924
Did you just say Franklin Saint?

09:00.957 --> 09:03.694
A witness recanted,

09:03.727 --> 09:06.129
Saint's file was sealed,

09:06.162 --> 09:09.866
and your job was made
all but impossible.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.635
I'm here to level
the playing field.

09:14.871 --> 09:16.172
(smoke alarm beeping)

09:16.206 --> 09:19.009
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

09:19.042 --> 09:20.610
Shit. Fuck!

09:20.643 --> 09:22.145
Shit. God...

09:22.178 --> 09:24.214
Come on. (groans)

09:25.548 --> 09:27.550
(groaning)

09:27.583 --> 09:29.519
God, come on, man.

09:32.923 --> 09:35.525
We're on the same side,
Officer Wright.

09:37.861 --> 09:40.563
(dog barking in distance)

09:45.101 --> 09:46.937
(door closes)

10:13.296 --> 10:15.298
That's it.

10:18.301 --> 10:19.535
Whoa.

10:19.569 --> 10:21.371
Hold up. (chuckles)

10:21.404 --> 10:23.206
Your keys.

10:25.575 --> 10:26.743
Fuck.

10:27.744 --> 10:30.280
-You all right?
-(sighs)

10:36.719 --> 10:40.123
You have a girlfriend, Franklin?

10:41.257 --> 10:43.159
A girlfriend or...?

10:46.129 --> 10:48.098
Nah.

10:48.131 --> 10:50.901
Nothing steady.

10:50.934 --> 10:53.636
You ever been in love?

10:56.773 --> 10:58.308
(chuckles)

10:58.341 --> 11:02.278
You not about to profess
or nothing, right? (laughs)

11:02.312 --> 11:05.715
I think I was once.
I don't know.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.717
You don't know
if you were in love or...?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.719
I mean, I-I cared about her,

11:09.752 --> 11:11.955
thought I could see myself
with her,

11:11.988 --> 11:14.724
but we were young, changing.

11:14.757 --> 11:18.094
Maybe what I thought was right
weren't the thing after all.

11:18.128 --> 11:21.464
Oh, yeah.

11:21.497 --> 11:23.433
See, that's-that's
exactly it, man.

11:23.466 --> 11:25.802
That is just right.
You got to wait...

11:25.836 --> 11:28.905
long as you can so that there is
as little chance as possible

11:28.939 --> 11:31.441
that someone goes and changes
on you, because I'm telling you,

11:31.474 --> 11:33.243
if you make the wrong
decision too early,

11:33.276 --> 11:34.911
then you could end up
tethered to someone

11:34.945 --> 11:37.680
for the rest of your life
who drives you

11:37.713 --> 11:39.715
completely crazy.

11:43.219 --> 11:45.688
And, you know, after all that,

11:45.721 --> 11:48.624
probably, you'll still
be in love with her.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.665
FRANKLIN:
All right, man.

11:55.698 --> 11:58.368
(car door closes)

11:58.401 --> 12:00.736
-Thanks for the advice.
-(engine starts)

12:03.139 --> 12:05.741
(car departs)

12:07.177 --> 12:08.845
Man, I swear I'm good for it.

12:08.879 --> 12:10.646
Nigga, you ain't good
for shit, a'ight?

12:10.680 --> 12:12.883
-Kick rocks.
-But I got prospects, for real.

12:12.916 --> 12:14.851
Look, look, I'll be back after
my shift with... What you want?

12:14.885 --> 12:17.353
-Diapers? Batteries?
-Get your ass out of here.

12:17.387 --> 12:19.956
-Fuck you doing here?
-Well, what the fuck
it look like?

12:19.990 --> 12:23.393
-Nigga, it look like
you slinging on my corner.
-Your corner?

12:23.426 --> 12:26.329
Only sign I see say Walnut,
not Bitch-Ass Bootsy.

12:26.362 --> 12:28.564
Lil' Lee want a sign, huh?

12:28.598 --> 12:30.800
-Lil' Lee want a sign?
-Yeah, that'd be real good.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.702
I'll show you a sign,
motherfucker!

12:32.735 --> 12:36.706
I'm telling you, ain't never
heard him sound like this.

12:36.739 --> 12:38.909
It was real personal, weird.

12:38.942 --> 12:42.812
-Mm.
-He was talking
about love, heartbreak.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.216
Well, maybe that's a good thing.
He trying to bond with you.

12:46.249 --> 12:49.419
Nah.
Ain't sound like a good thing.

12:49.452 --> 12:52.088
-Sound like he was fucked up.
-Mm.

12:54.124 --> 12:57.593
Listen, Franklin,
I know you got a lot of shit

12:57.627 --> 13:00.430
you trying to figure out
and sort through,

13:00.463 --> 13:03.066
but Leon and Jerome,
they need to know the truth

13:03.099 --> 13:05.868
-about what we dealing with.
-I know.

13:05.902 --> 13:07.870
And I'm-a tell them, too.

13:07.904 --> 13:10.040
I'm-a tell them.

13:10.073 --> 13:11.674
(sighs)

13:11.707 --> 13:13.576
Just got to find
the right time, you know?

13:13.609 --> 13:16.046
You talking about
maybe needing to run.

13:16.079 --> 13:18.348
This is the time.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.250
Besides, I'm tired
of trying to hide shit

13:20.283 --> 13:22.252
-from my man.
-(pager beeping)

13:22.285 --> 13:24.287
-They found her.
-Mel?

13:24.320 --> 13:26.122
-Yeah.
-Look, Franklin.

13:26.156 --> 13:29.125
Franklin, stop.

13:29.159 --> 13:33.396
I know you don't want to hear
this, baby, but Mel is gone.

13:33.429 --> 13:35.431
You gonna have to let her go.

13:39.669 --> 13:41.271
* Like the sound of thunder
and without a blunder... *

13:41.304 --> 13:43.439
I look like I'm out here
trying to have a photo shoot?

13:43.473 --> 13:45.641
-You can always pawn it.
-Bitch, why don't you pawn it?

13:45.675 --> 13:48.078
(scoffs) Let me guess,
'cause it's stolen, right?

13:48.111 --> 13:49.712
Look, I'll take one rock for it.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.913
Just one.

13:50.947 --> 13:52.482
Just one rock.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.384
What...? Wh...?

13:54.417 --> 13:56.819
(sighs) Fuck!

13:56.852 --> 13:58.721
* They came from everywhere
just to see... *

13:58.754 --> 14:00.890
Got your spies
everywhere now, huh?

14:00.923 --> 14:02.725
-That's right. Come on.
-Don't touch me.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.894
-They're not gonna
sell to you, Mel.
-Why?

14:04.927 --> 14:06.729
'Cause you told them not to?

14:06.762 --> 14:09.265
-So you can make the shit,
but I can't smoke it?
-Listen.

14:09.299 --> 14:12.235
I'm telling you this
as somebody who cares about you:

14:12.268 --> 14:13.936
You got to stop.

14:13.970 --> 14:15.638
* Just a flick of his wrist... *

14:15.671 --> 14:16.839
Okay?

14:16.872 --> 14:19.309
You can still get cleaned up.

14:19.342 --> 14:20.910
You can still go to school.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.945
Get your life right.

14:22.979 --> 14:24.614
Come on, Mel.
You and I both know

14:24.647 --> 14:26.716
that you better than this shit.

14:30.153 --> 14:31.954
I know.

14:31.988 --> 14:34.157
* So move your butt
and shake your hips... *

14:34.190 --> 14:36.959
And I want to get better,
Franklin. I just...

14:36.993 --> 14:39.329
-I don't know if I can.
-You can.

14:39.362 --> 14:41.764
You can,
'cause I'll take you home.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.666
Okay? We'll get you out.

14:43.699 --> 14:46.369
-Okay?
-Okay.

14:46.402 --> 14:49.105
Good.
Well, let's get out of here.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.007
-(Franklin grunts)
-(laughter)

14:51.041 --> 14:52.608
MELODY:
Big man Franklin Saint,

14:52.642 --> 14:55.345
on the ground
holding his little nuts.

14:55.378 --> 14:57.680
Oh, what you gonna do?
You gonna touch me?

14:57.713 --> 15:00.983
You touch me,
my daddy will fucking kill you.

15:01.017 --> 15:03.619
* So all you other DJs
take this advice *

15:03.653 --> 15:05.321
* You don't be a fool
and try to slice *

15:05.355 --> 15:07.323
* 'Cause when you go
against Yella *

15:07.357 --> 15:09.825
* You'll pay the price. *

15:13.663 --> 15:16.266
Don't page me about
this shit again.

15:20.203 --> 15:22.338
One rock.

15:45.061 --> 15:46.296
(sighs quietly)

15:53.736 --> 15:55.871
(sighs)

16:17.059 --> 16:19.362
(grunting)

16:19.395 --> 16:23.065
-(crunching)
-(quietly): Shit.

16:23.099 --> 16:25.101
(panting quietly)

16:25.135 --> 16:27.137
*

16:43.119 --> 16:45.121
*

17:03.473 --> 17:05.275
(grunts)

17:11.781 --> 17:13.783
*

17:38.174 --> 17:39.475
Damn!

17:43.746 --> 17:45.147
(grunts) Come on!

17:47.082 --> 17:48.518
(exhales)

17:53.155 --> 17:56.158
(grunts) Come on!

17:56.192 --> 17:58.794
(yells)

17:58.828 --> 18:01.897
Where's my fucking gun?!

18:26.722 --> 18:29.459
*

18:47.310 --> 18:49.579
(siren wailing in distance)

18:51.581 --> 18:54.384
(sighs)

18:54.417 --> 18:56.686
Look to me like they
fucked you up good, homie.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.688
That motherfucker
sucker punched me.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.189
So y'all was just minding
your own business

19:00.222 --> 19:01.457
and they came up on you?

19:01.491 --> 19:02.958
Nah, man, we rolled up on them,

19:02.992 --> 19:04.927
'cause they were selling
in our territory.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.429
Come on, man,
ain't you been listening?

19:06.462 --> 19:08.464
Nigga, what's the move?
Who we gonna hit first?

19:08.498 --> 19:11.200
Ain't gonna be no retaliation
till I talk to Saint.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.903
Man, fuck talking.
That time is done.

19:13.936 --> 19:15.738
I don't eat no ass,

19:15.771 --> 19:18.073
I don't cuss in front
of my little sisters,

19:18.107 --> 19:19.775
and I don't go to war

19:19.809 --> 19:22.077
'cause one of mine's
got some cuts and bruises.

19:22.111 --> 19:24.280
-This some bullshit.
-No, this some Leon.

19:24.314 --> 19:27.383
See, your problem is,
you got tunnel vision.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.720
Luckily, I can see
the whole field.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.722
Somebody get
this nigga some ice.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.690
That shit fucked up.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.543
*

20:07.790 --> 20:09.792
(pager beeping)

20:29.311 --> 20:32.314
(line rings, clicks)

20:32.348 --> 20:33.616
(man speaks indistinctly
over phone)

20:33.649 --> 20:35.451
Hey, it's Reed Thompson.
What's up?

20:35.485 --> 20:37.653
(indistinct chatter over phone)

20:37.687 --> 20:39.154
Okay, where-where is he?

20:39.188 --> 20:40.723
(indistinct chatter over phone)

20:40.756 --> 20:43.526
Okay. Yeah, I'll be there
in the next half hour.

20:43.559 --> 20:44.827
(indistinct chatter over phone)

20:44.860 --> 20:46.996
Okay. Thank you.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.501
(door closes)

20:56.171 --> 20:58.541
(keys drop on table)

20:58.574 --> 21:00.576
(sniffs)

21:09.351 --> 21:11.353
*

21:12.555 --> 21:14.189
What the f...

21:14.223 --> 21:17.359
(panting)

21:22.698 --> 21:24.700
(panting)

21:29.038 --> 21:30.440
Fuck!

21:30.473 --> 21:32.107
No. No.

21:32.141 --> 21:34.176
What the fuck?
(exhales sharply)

21:34.209 --> 21:35.911
Okay.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.401
(engine starts)

22:04.574 --> 22:06.642
Fuck!

22:06.676 --> 22:08.678
*

22:32.968 --> 22:34.970
*

22:52.822 --> 22:54.389
What is all this?

22:55.457 --> 22:57.226
Take a seat, bro.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.863
I want to tell you a story.

23:00.896 --> 23:03.465
-I'll stand.
-Whatever.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.369
You take a bath?

23:08.403 --> 23:10.039
What?

23:10.072 --> 23:12.875
Uh, no. I take showers.

23:12.908 --> 23:14.376
Showers.

23:14.409 --> 23:15.878
I can see that.

23:15.911 --> 23:19.148
Mr. Stand Up,
Mr. Won't Take A Seat.

23:22.518 --> 23:25.420
This morning,
I'm soaking in a tub.

23:26.756 --> 23:28.290
Getting primo fellatio

23:28.323 --> 23:30.960
from a world-champion swimmer...

23:30.993 --> 23:33.495
when Mr. Eddie comes in.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.701
I tell you about
Mr. Eddie, right?

23:38.734 --> 23:40.169
No?

23:42.071 --> 23:43.739
My DEA mole?

23:46.041 --> 23:47.843
Mr. Eddie comes in,

23:47.877 --> 23:52.281
in a tizzy, running his mouth,
and says...

23:53.515 --> 23:55.685
You got to leave town, Rigo.

23:55.718 --> 23:59.354
What do you mean,
"You got to leave town, Rigo"?

23:59.388 --> 24:01.356
DEA's about to come after you.

24:01.390 --> 24:03.358
I'm trying to hold 'em off,
but I'm one man.

24:03.392 --> 24:05.327
-I can only do so much.
-What the fuck?

24:05.360 --> 24:07.229
Why the fuck is the DEA
coming after me?

24:07.262 --> 24:09.231
Because an hour ago,
I was in my office

24:09.264 --> 24:11.701
conferring with my assistant,
and one of my best guys

24:11.734 --> 24:14.036
comes in, happy as a clam,
saying...

24:15.070 --> 24:16.338
The case against the Villanuevas

24:16.371 --> 24:18.073
has been reactivated.

24:18.107 --> 24:20.843
I thought the Villanueva case
was shut down months ago.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.412
Well, now it's reopened.

24:23.445 --> 24:25.414
And Rigo Vasco's
wrapped up in it.

24:25.447 --> 24:28.217
-Who?
-Come on, fuck. You remember.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.853
That rep with
the Medellín Cartel in L.A.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.255
I know where he is.

24:33.288 --> 24:38.093
The only link between me...

24:38.127 --> 24:40.429
and the Villanueva family...

24:40.462 --> 24:42.431
is you, motherfucker.

24:42.464 --> 24:44.033
So tell me, Reed Thompson,

24:44.066 --> 24:46.535
why the fuck is the DEA
coming after me?

24:46.568 --> 24:47.937
I can't tell you, Rigo.
I don't know.

24:47.970 --> 24:49.538
But I can tell you

24:49.571 --> 24:51.607
you don't have to
worry about it.

24:51.641 --> 24:53.876
What?

24:53.909 --> 24:56.979
¿Por qué, hijo de putas?
Why not?

24:57.012 --> 24:58.447
Because my name
isn't Reed Thompson.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.149
It's Teddy McDonald,
and I'm an officer

25:00.182 --> 25:01.751
-with the CIA.
-Yeah, right.

25:01.784 --> 25:04.086
You are the CIA,
and me and my best friends,

25:04.119 --> 25:05.554
we are the Village People group.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.156
I assume you know who we are.

25:07.189 --> 25:08.924
Yeah, sure. I know.

25:08.958 --> 25:13.562
You overthrow governments
and install puppet dictators.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.565
You know how we do that?
We make friends.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.335
Friends who stand to gain
as U.S. interests are advanced.

25:20.369 --> 25:22.604
So my question to you
right now is:

25:22.638 --> 25:25.274
How would you like to be
a friend of the U.S. government?

25:25.307 --> 25:28.477
If you are the CIA...

25:28.510 --> 25:32.014
why the fuck are you
bringing cocaine into America?

25:33.783 --> 25:35.685
Why don't we take a ride?

25:35.718 --> 25:37.720
And I'll explain everything.

25:43.392 --> 25:46.829
-NIX: Holy shit.
-ANDRE: Here we are,

25:46.862 --> 25:49.598
killing ourselves
to keep these drugs away,

25:49.631 --> 25:52.668
and our government
is just bringing them in.

25:52.702 --> 25:54.503
Man.

25:56.538 --> 25:59.274
It's almost too much to believe.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.176
So, what are you thinking?

26:01.210 --> 26:03.746
Burn the whole
fucking thing down.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.850
(sighs)

26:07.883 --> 26:09.852
I knew a guy in 'Nam.

26:09.885 --> 26:13.222
He was a sniper.
Best aim I ever saw.

26:13.255 --> 26:15.691
Could shoot the nipple
off a tit from a mile away.

26:15.725 --> 26:17.226
One day,

26:17.259 --> 26:20.062
I see him slip something
into this little tin box.

26:20.095 --> 26:23.232
So I ask him about it.
He shows me.

26:23.265 --> 26:25.467
Inside that box--
I shit you not--

26:25.500 --> 26:28.137
are 16 goddamn thumbs.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.973
This guy cut the left thumb

26:31.006 --> 26:32.975
off of every single one
of his kills.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.811
Now, you know where
that twisted sack of shit

26:35.845 --> 26:38.080
is working right now?

26:38.113 --> 26:40.415
CI-fucking-A.

26:40.449 --> 26:42.251
(long exhale)

26:42.284 --> 26:44.086
Yeah.

26:44.119 --> 26:46.688
I heard stories like that, too.

26:46.722 --> 26:49.591
Look, partner...

26:49.624 --> 26:52.227
I know you're hurting.

26:52.261 --> 26:54.063
All this shit with Mel,

26:54.096 --> 26:55.831
that you want payback.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.333
But you go shouting this kind
of shit from the rooftops,

26:58.367 --> 27:01.436
you are gonna have the worst
kind of people after your ass.

27:01.470 --> 27:03.505
So, what am I supposed to do?

27:03.538 --> 27:06.008
Turn my back?
Look the other way?

27:06.041 --> 27:09.278
No, no, no.
No, I didn't say that.

27:09.311 --> 27:11.280
This agency spook...

27:11.313 --> 27:13.916
he don't give a shit about
Mr. Small-Time,

27:13.949 --> 27:15.450
hood rat drug dealer.

27:15.484 --> 27:17.052
We kill this kid,

27:17.086 --> 27:19.121
he'll just find somebody else
to take his place.

27:19.154 --> 27:21.723
So, as far as I'm concerned,

27:21.757 --> 27:25.594
it's still open season
on Franklin Saint.

27:25.627 --> 27:27.129
You want to go after
the problem?

27:27.162 --> 27:28.964
We go at him.

27:28.998 --> 27:30.665
Just like you wanted.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.543
TEDDY:
Once I move the cocaine,

27:41.576 --> 27:43.378
I use the proceeds
to buy weapons,

27:43.412 --> 27:45.747
supplies, whatever we need.

27:45.781 --> 27:48.283
And I funnel that back
to the Contras.

27:51.286 --> 27:53.155
So...

27:53.188 --> 27:54.656
what do I get...

27:54.689 --> 27:57.726
if I am the best friends
with the CIA?

27:57.759 --> 27:59.728
(softly):
Huh.

27:59.761 --> 28:04.233
Well, in addition to the money,
I would feed you intelligence

28:04.266 --> 28:08.003
about anybody that, say,
gives you headaches.

28:08.037 --> 28:10.672
The Cali Cartel, your cartel,

28:10.705 --> 28:13.943
local police, my DEA,
your government, whoever.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.679
I keep you safe,
you keep my secret.

28:17.712 --> 28:19.681
-It's a true partnership.
-(chuckles)

28:27.456 --> 28:31.793
And if I don't want to partner
with American government, what?

28:33.896 --> 28:35.931
Kill me.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.267
Cut me into little pieces
and dump me in the ocean.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.435
And then...

28:40.469 --> 28:43.038
in addition to the DEA,

28:43.072 --> 28:45.807
you can add the CIA
to your list of enemies.

28:49.678 --> 28:54.449
If I say yes,
do I get a Rolex Submariner

28:54.483 --> 28:56.351
that can deflect bullets?

28:58.253 --> 29:00.155
Do we have a deal?

29:00.189 --> 29:02.591
You have a big boss, right?

29:04.259 --> 29:07.863
I meet him,
and we make this official.

29:14.436 --> 29:16.305
Welcome to the CIA.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.941
(chuckles)
Well...

29:23.913 --> 29:25.380
(dialing)

29:43.565 --> 29:45.567
(exhales sharply)

29:48.203 --> 29:51.173
(pay phone rings)

29:51.206 --> 29:53.108
Reed Thompson,
to what do I owe the pleasure?

29:53.142 --> 29:54.109
Avi, listen to me.

29:54.143 --> 29:55.277
There's been chatter
on the wire.

29:55.310 --> 29:56.611
We got to shut everything down
for a minute.

29:56.645 --> 29:58.413
-What?
-You got to... you got to get

29:58.447 --> 30:00.015
out of town, okay?
You got to lay low.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.550
I-I can't tell you any more
for right now,

30:01.583 --> 30:03.685
but you got to get the fuck out
of that house, and don't even

30:03.718 --> 30:05.054
stop to pack your bags,
you got it?

30:05.087 --> 30:07.556
My bags are always packed. Yuda!

30:07.589 --> 30:09.558
(pay phone rings)

30:09.591 --> 30:10.993
Hello?

30:12.894 --> 30:15.230
-Product's coming early?
-(jackhammer roaring)

30:15.264 --> 30:18.567
No, look, um, we have to shut
everything down for a minute.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.302
What? Wait, wait.
Wait a second.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.475
(jackhammering stops)

30:26.508 --> 30:28.310
(speaks Spanish)
What?

30:28.343 --> 30:30.645
You got to lay low,
go underground.

30:30.679 --> 30:32.447
Stay off the grid.

30:32.481 --> 30:34.416
-Why? What happened?
-Don't contact anyone.

30:34.449 --> 30:37.052
-You can't go back
to Sinaloa, you got it?
-No Sinaloa.

30:37.086 --> 30:39.388
Okay. When are you coming down
to San Ysidro

30:39.421 --> 30:40.922
and check what
I've been working on?

30:40.956 --> 30:43.125
What? No, lay low.

30:43.158 --> 30:45.327
I'm saying, don't
contact anyone. You got it?

30:45.360 --> 30:47.096
Okay. Okay. Vale.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.803
(breathing heavily)

31:01.610 --> 31:03.478
(pay phone rings)

31:03.512 --> 31:06.148
Hey, man.
(clears throat)

31:06.181 --> 31:08.583
Something's going on.
We've been compromised.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.918
Compromised how?

31:09.951 --> 31:11.520
I don't know yet,
but I'll call you

31:11.553 --> 31:12.787
as soon as I know more.

31:12.821 --> 31:13.922
Wait, hold up.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.525
Somebody broke into my spot.

31:16.558 --> 31:18.560
Could it be related?

31:19.961 --> 31:22.497
Fuck. Fuck.

31:22.531 --> 31:25.200
Broke in how? Was there...
did they take anything?

31:25.234 --> 31:27.836
Nothing missing.

31:27.869 --> 31:31.006
But they bypassed my alarm
and tore up the place.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.276
Okay.
The person I'm thinking of,

31:34.309 --> 31:36.378
you never would have known
she was there.

31:36.411 --> 31:38.513
You just lay low, okay?

31:38.547 --> 31:41.050
I'll, uh... I'll be in touch
when I know some more.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.218
Yeah.

31:43.252 --> 31:44.319
Okay.

31:44.353 --> 31:47.056
(panting)

31:51.360 --> 31:53.328
"She"?

31:56.165 --> 31:58.400
He said it wasn't him.

31:58.433 --> 32:00.202
And you believe him?

32:00.235 --> 32:03.472
LOUIE:
Franklin, he calls you

32:03.505 --> 32:05.140
right after your place
gets busted up,

32:05.174 --> 32:07.142
tells you shit is going down,

32:07.176 --> 32:08.810
and you don't think
the two is related?

32:08.843 --> 32:11.680
Look, the person who broke
into my spot was angry.

32:12.781 --> 32:14.716
They wanted to destroy it.

32:16.785 --> 32:18.753
This was Andre.

32:18.787 --> 32:20.655
LOUIE:
Andre?

32:20.689 --> 32:22.191
How'd he even find your place?

32:22.224 --> 32:25.360
I don't know.
He-he must have followed me.

32:25.394 --> 32:28.163
And your alarm?

32:28.197 --> 32:31.066
Well, a lot
of these cops have...

32:31.100 --> 32:34.336
security system guys
on the payroll.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.604
LOUIE:
Okay.

32:35.637 --> 32:37.272
Okay, so...

32:37.306 --> 32:39.241
I mean, we all right, then.

32:39.274 --> 32:41.243
Right? You don't keep drugs
at your place.

32:41.276 --> 32:43.845
You know he ain't got
the badge and the gun.

32:43.878 --> 32:47.015
And from what you can see,
it ain't no cash missing, so...

32:47.048 --> 32:50.119
Something else is missing.

32:50.152 --> 32:52.053
A file.

32:53.288 --> 32:55.023
(Franklin sighs)

32:55.056 --> 32:57.559
Detailing all my business
with Reed Thompson.

32:57.592 --> 33:00.629
Franklin, what the fuck
are you talking about?

33:00.662 --> 33:04.032
I kept it as evidence
in case something went wrong.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.801
Wait.
What exactly is in it, son?

33:06.835 --> 33:09.138
Everything.

33:09.171 --> 33:12.040
A written record
of all my business with Reed.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.909
Top Notch's photos
of us together.

33:14.943 --> 33:17.879
Research,
newspaper articles, maps...

33:17.912 --> 33:20.081
all to do with the CIA
and Nicaragua.

33:20.115 --> 33:21.950
And you just had this shit
just laying around?

33:21.983 --> 33:23.418
Of course not.
I kept it hidden.

33:23.452 --> 33:24.786
But Andre fucking found it.

33:24.819 --> 33:26.588
Wait, you said that Andre

33:26.621 --> 33:29.391
has pictures of you
with the CIA connect

33:29.424 --> 33:32.794
and 200 kilos of coke?

33:38.767 --> 33:41.035
(sighs)

33:48.443 --> 33:51.313
(indistinct chatter)

33:51.346 --> 33:53.081
YUDA:
Avi. We have room
for the shofar?

33:53.114 --> 33:55.150
No, I don't want this shofar.

33:55.184 --> 33:56.285
I hate it. Come on.

33:56.318 --> 33:57.452
(speaks Hebrew)

33:57.486 --> 33:59.120
Toss me the keys.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.258
(speaking Hebrew)

34:03.292 --> 34:04.659
(bullet whizzes)

34:06.027 --> 34:07.095
(bullet whizzes)

34:07.128 --> 34:09.598
(both shouting in Hebrew)

34:09.631 --> 34:10.965
(bullet ricochets)

34:12.701 --> 34:14.469
(shouting continues)

34:18.573 --> 34:20.209
(grunts)
Go, go, go, go, go!

34:20.242 --> 34:21.776
-(engine starts)
-(bullet ricochets)

34:21.810 --> 34:23.578
(tires squealing)

34:27.216 --> 34:29.218
*

34:43.164 --> 34:45.166
(crickets chirping)

34:48.203 --> 34:49.871
Teddy?

34:58.713 --> 35:00.349
Did you do this?

35:05.119 --> 35:06.855
What happened?

35:09.190 --> 35:13.194
Rigo has a mole inside the DEA.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.198
-Oh, shit.
-Which he informed me of

35:17.232 --> 35:19.368
after I walked
into a room lined in plastic.

35:22.737 --> 35:25.039
A chain saw waiting
on the table for me.

35:27.108 --> 35:28.777
Holy shit, Teddy.

35:28.810 --> 35:31.346
Avi called.

35:31.380 --> 35:34.716
One of his men was gunned down
in broad daylight.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.753
Also, somebody broke
into Franklin's house.

35:38.787 --> 35:42.457
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

35:43.758 --> 35:47.028
Was this you,
or was this the Agency?

35:47.061 --> 35:50.465
The Agency sent me out here

35:50.499 --> 35:54.202
to learn every aspect
of your operation,

35:54.235 --> 35:58.239
and then take it away from you.

35:58.273 --> 36:00.475
Ending it was my idea.

36:00.509 --> 36:02.511
(shuddering breaths)

36:08.149 --> 36:09.651
Jesus Christ.

36:09.684 --> 36:11.252
You've always known
how I felt about this op.

36:11.286 --> 36:13.322
You blew up my whole operation.

36:15.324 --> 36:17.559
You outed every last one
of my assets.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.561
Have you lost
your fucking mind?!

36:19.594 --> 36:21.296
I could ask you the same thing.

36:21.330 --> 36:23.465
Bringing cocaine into the U.S.?

36:23.498 --> 36:26.067
Exposing yourself,
the Agency, me?

36:26.100 --> 36:28.337
-Covering up murders?
Fucking committing them?
-Stop! Stop!

36:28.370 --> 36:30.839
Tell me exactly what you did.
I can fix this.

36:30.872 --> 36:33.942
You can't fix this.

36:33.975 --> 36:37.011
It's done. It's over.

36:37.045 --> 36:39.080
Please just let it go.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.949
(stammers)

36:40.982 --> 36:44.118
We can still walk away
from this together.

36:44.152 --> 36:47.055
-Before you or the Agency
gets hurt.
-(laughs)

36:50.191 --> 36:52.594
Sorry.

36:52.627 --> 36:56.064
Walk away from this with you?

36:57.131 --> 36:59.501
You're a traitor.

36:59.534 --> 37:01.202
You're a liar.

37:01.235 --> 37:05.173
And any love that I had for you
is completely gone.

37:05.206 --> 37:07.642
I am gonna salvage this op,

37:07.676 --> 37:09.478
and after I do,
I'm gonna make sure

37:09.511 --> 37:12.881
that you spend the rest
of your meaningless career

37:12.914 --> 37:16.851
in a basement office alone
and so miserable.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.189
And I just don't even care.

37:29.531 --> 37:31.533
*

37:37.539 --> 37:40.542
-(distant chatter)
-(distant sirens wailing)

37:46.180 --> 37:47.849
WANDA:
Hey!

37:47.882 --> 37:49.418
-What you doing?
-Go away, Wanda.

37:49.451 --> 37:51.352
Oh, damn. It's like that?

37:51.386 --> 37:53.054
I thought we was girls.

37:53.087 --> 37:54.889
Bitch, last time I saw you,

37:54.923 --> 37:57.191
you knocked me out
and stole my mama's necklace.

37:58.393 --> 38:01.062
Oh, that's old shit. Come on.

38:01.095 --> 38:03.064
-Let's go to the skating rink.
-I got fired.

38:03.097 --> 38:05.767
-Oh, shit. What about the, uh...
-They changed the passcode.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.569
Shit.

38:09.538 --> 38:11.506
Let's go hustle.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.743
I know this lady, Miss Ethel,
live over on 39th.

38:14.776 --> 38:16.277
She'll hook it up.

38:18.079 --> 38:21.082
-Hook it up h-how?
-What you mean, how?

38:21.115 --> 38:23.184
Look, you knock on the door,

38:23.217 --> 38:25.386
tell the bitch
you selling candy or some shit,

38:25.420 --> 38:28.256
-and then I'll do the hard part.
-You talking about stealing?

38:28.289 --> 38:30.925
-(clicks tongue)
-I ain't helping you
rob no old lady, Wanda.

38:30.959 --> 38:34.328
Come on, what, you-you too good
to get your pretty hands dirty?

38:35.497 --> 38:37.298
Oh.

38:37.331 --> 38:40.234
-You got some on you right now.
-No, I don't.

38:40.268 --> 38:41.870
-Yeah, you do. Give it up.
-No, I don't.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.271
-What the fuck you doing?
-Come on.

38:43.304 --> 38:44.873
Wanda, get the fuck off of me!

38:44.906 --> 38:46.407
Where are you hiding it at?
It's in your pussy.

38:46.441 --> 38:48.276
Get the fuck off me!

38:48.309 --> 38:50.645
I'm sick of this shit!

38:50.679 --> 38:53.448
-I'm going home.
-Well, go on, then.

38:53.482 --> 38:56.217
A'ight, run home to your daddy.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.319
Stuck-up bitch!

39:08.830 --> 39:11.032
(grunts softly)

39:23.444 --> 39:25.680
(crying)

39:27.448 --> 39:29.618
(sniffles)

39:29.651 --> 39:32.153
(window slides open)

39:32.186 --> 39:34.656
(footsteps)

39:34.689 --> 39:37.926
Mel?

39:37.959 --> 39:40.094
Mel, is that you?
(chuckles)

39:40.128 --> 39:42.497
Hey, baby,
I just realized that...

39:42.531 --> 39:44.533
*

39:51.906 --> 39:54.943
How'd you get in here?

39:54.976 --> 39:58.713
Same way I have
since I was eight years old.

39:58.747 --> 40:00.348
That my gun?

40:00.381 --> 40:03.918
You went looking for it
in the wrong place.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.522
Put it down, Franklin.

40:16.064 --> 40:18.032
(sighs)

40:18.066 --> 40:20.869
I don't suppose, if I asked you
if you told anybody

40:20.902 --> 40:24.072
about this shit,
you'd tell me the truth?

40:24.105 --> 40:26.875
Do you know who
these people are, Franklin?

40:26.908 --> 40:29.243
-What they're involved in?
-Sit down.

40:41.055 --> 40:42.691
Put it in the folder.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.898
Look, you're angry and afraid.
I get it.

40:49.931 --> 40:52.100
But you don't have to do this.

40:52.133 --> 40:54.202
Put down the gun down,
and we can talk.

40:54.235 --> 40:57.538
Ain't nothing you can tell me
I don't already know, Andre.

40:57.572 --> 40:59.941
I know I helped raise you.

40:59.974 --> 41:04.045
You were a good kid, one of
the smartest kids I ever knew.

41:06.080 --> 41:09.050
You're not gonna kill a cop
in his own house.

41:24.966 --> 41:28.102
You took me to that crack den,

41:28.136 --> 41:31.405
gave me a chance,
so now I'm-a give you one.

41:31.439 --> 41:34.208
Forget you ever saw
any of this shit, Andre.

41:34.242 --> 41:38.579
Get out of town with Mel,
and don't ever come back.

41:38.613 --> 41:40.815
Who is this man
that you're protecting?

41:40.849 --> 41:42.951
Huh? You know he don't give
two shits about you.

41:42.984 --> 41:45.586
Leave L.A. forever, Andre.
Disappear.

41:45.620 --> 41:49.457
And just maybe the two of us
can make it out this shit alive.

41:57.498 --> 41:58.900
(laughs softly)

41:58.933 --> 42:01.102
Okay, Franklin.

42:01.135 --> 42:04.238
I'll leave now, tonight.

42:04.272 --> 42:06.440
I'll get Mel far away from you,

42:06.474 --> 42:09.177
get her cleaned up
and in school.

42:11.212 --> 42:13.214
But then I'm coming back.

42:14.716 --> 42:17.451
I've put in 18 years
out of my 20,

42:17.485 --> 42:19.520
and I'm not gonna let you
run me away

42:19.553 --> 42:21.589
and destroy this community.

42:21.622 --> 42:25.426
So, you want to play
cops and robbers?

42:25.459 --> 42:27.662
Okay, we can do that.

42:30.198 --> 42:33.668
I'll come back, fresh start,

42:33.702 --> 42:36.537
and it's you and me,
head-to-head.

42:37.739 --> 42:39.808
And we'll see who's standing.

42:39.841 --> 42:42.176
Here's your file.

42:42.210 --> 42:44.178
You ain't a fucking killer.

42:44.212 --> 42:46.881
Now, get the fuck
out of my house.

42:54.055 --> 42:56.224
You're right, Andre.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.495
I'm not a killer.

43:15.209 --> 43:18.412
(shuddering breaths)

43:21.515 --> 43:23.251
(groans quietly)

43:27.722 --> 43:29.924
(dog barking in distance)

Never get too greedy, Franklin.

45:48.362 --> 45:50.999
The minute you do that,
you lost your advantage.

45:55.069 --> 45:58.372
From here on out,
we'll only deal
with high-level customers.

45:59.908 --> 46:02.376
-You having trust issues?
-No way.

46:04.612 --> 46:07.581
It's up to you
to protect everyone.
Can you do it or not?

46:09.884 --> 46:11.785
How are you sleeping at night?

46:11.886 --> 46:13.187
Like a baby.
