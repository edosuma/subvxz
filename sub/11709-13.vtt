07:11.806 --> 07:13.724
{\an8}[cheering]

07:13.808 --> 07:16.519
{\an8}- SO HOT.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.020
{\an8}JIONNI'S GONNA BE LUCKY
REGARDLESS TONIGHT

07:18.104 --> 07:20.523
{\an8}BECAUSE I MISS HIS PEE-PEE,

07:20.606 --> 07:22.608
{\an8}BUT THE FACT THAT HE JUST
BEAT MIKE IN FOOTBALL,

07:22.692 --> 07:24.652
{\an8}HE'S GONNA GET
EXTRA PEE-PEE TIME.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.863
{\an8}HE'S GETTING SOME TONIGHT.
[chuckles]

07:26.946 --> 07:28.239
{\an8}- WHAT'S YOUR PLANS?
LIKE, WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE?

07:28.322 --> 07:31.367
{\an8}- ME AND RON ARE GONNA TAKE
THE NEXT STEP

07:31.450 --> 07:35.496
{\an8}AND MOVE IN TOGETHER,
YOU KNOW.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.000
{\an8}WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?
- [laughs]

07:42.795 --> 07:45.047
{\an8}- CHEERS!

07:45.131 --> 07:46.215
{\an8}- I'VE GOTTA TRY
YOUR SPECIALTY.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.800
{\an8}- ME AND VINNY
RODE THAT THING TOGETHER.

07:47.884 --> 07:48.384
{\an8}IT WAS ROMANTIC.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.052
{\an8}- VINNY, IS THAT RIGHT?

07:50.136 --> 07:51.179
{\an8}YOU WENT UP
FOR A RIDE WITH HIM?

07:51.262 --> 07:52.096
{\an8}- YEAH.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.222
{\an8}- PAULY'S GONNA BE
MY NIECE SOON.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.224
{\an8}- [laughs]

07:55.308 --> 07:56.893
{\an8}- FOR ME, IT WAS PROBABLY

07:56.976 --> 07:57.894
{\an8}MY BEST SUMMER
THAT I EVER HAD.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.396
{\an8}- HERE?
- YEAH.

08:00.479 --> 08:03.441
{\an8}- I HAD A LOT OF FUN.
- NO DRAMA, THOUGH, HUH?

08:03.524 --> 08:04.817
{\an8}- NO, STAYED AWAY FROM--

08:04.901 --> 08:06.068
{\an8}- THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH
OF THAT IN YOUR LIFE.

08:06.152 --> 08:06.736
{\an8}- I KNOW.
I'M, LIKE, OVER THE DRAMA.

08:06.819 --> 08:07.528
{\an8}THERE'S NO DRAMA.
- HOLY COW.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.613
{\an8}- I DIDN'T REALLY FIGHT
WITH RON.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.573
{\an8}- THAT'S GREAT.
- THINGS ARE GOING REALLY GOOD.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.492
{\an8}I THINK, OVERALL, MY JOURNEY
WITH RON HAS BEEN CRAZY.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.871
{\an8}WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT ALL,
EVERY HIGH, EVERY LOW,

08:16.954 --> 08:18.831
{\an8}EVERY DISGUSTING THING.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.083
{\an8}I WANT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.501
{\an8}- MOVE OUT THE ROOM.
I'LL MOVE YOUR SHIT MYSELF.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.504
{\an8}FUCKING--
- STOP! YOU PSYCHO!

08:25.588 --> 08:28.257
{\an8}I THINK THAT WE HAVE
THIS AMAZING CONNECTION

08:28.341 --> 08:30.593
{\an8}THAT NOBODY JUST UNDERSTANDS.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.596
{\an8}- SO NOW THAT YOU AND RONNIE
HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.597
{\an8}WHAT'S YOUR PLANS,
LIKE, WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE?

08:35.681 --> 08:38.100
{\an8}- HONESTLY, I THINK
ME AND RON ARE GONNA TAKE

08:38.183 --> 08:41.770
{\an8}THE NEXT STEP, AND, UH,
MOVE IN TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

08:41.854 --> 08:42.813
{\an8}- [chuckles]
- WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

08:42.897 --> 08:45.608
{\an8}- [laughs]

08:45.691 --> 08:47.610
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

08:47.693 --> 08:50.029
{\an8}IT'S ABOUT FRICKING TIME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:50.112 --> 08:52.865
{\an8}DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S ABOUT FRICKING TIME?

08:52.949 --> 08:55.576
{\an8}- SHE SAID SHE'S GONNA MOVE
TO NEW YORK, SO...

08:55.660 --> 08:56.702
{\an8}TIME TO DO IT.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.538
{\an8}IT'S LIKE, SHIT
OR GET OFF THE POT.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.665
{\an8}- YOU GOT THE FRICKIN' WORLD
AT YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW,

09:00.748 --> 09:02.792
{\an8}SO JUST FRICKIN' ENJOY IT.

09:02.875 --> 09:03.543
{\an8}THAT'S ALL.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.419
{\an8}- I THINK MY DAD
IS DEFINITELY IFFY

09:05.503 --> 09:08.381
{\an8}ON THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN ME AND SAM

09:08.464 --> 09:10.091
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
ON AND OFF SO MUCH.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.134
{\an8}- YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, SAM...
- WHAT?

09:12.218 --> 09:15.888
{\an8}- IN THE BEGINNING OF
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RONNIE,

09:15.972 --> 09:18.224
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IT, HONEY,
IT WAS KINDA TOUGH.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.308
{\an8}I MEAN, LIKE, THE FIGHTS.
I MEAN, HOLY COW.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.768
{\an8}- SO?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

09:20.851 --> 09:23.688
{\an8}- I MEAN, WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.189
{\an8}I'M AT A GOOD PLACE
IN MY LIFE.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.482
{\an8}WHY CAN'T I FORGET THAT?

09:26.565 --> 09:27.984
{\an8}I HOPE YOU DO,
AND I HOPE IT IS BEHIND YOU.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.318
{\an8}- IT'S LIKE,
WHY EVEN BRING IT UP?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.946
{\an8}I MEAN, LET'S JUST DROP IT.
- WELL, YEAH.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.324
{\an8}- IT'S, LIKE,
ANNOYING ALREADY.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.536
{\an8}MY DAD IS JUST SKEPTICAL OF RON
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS,

09:38.619 --> 09:39.495
{\an8}SO I'M JUST HOPING
THAT MY DAD AND MOM

09:39.578 --> 09:43.833
{\an8}CAN GET ALONG,
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.459
{\an8}- BYE, MOM!
- BYE, DAD, LOVE YOU.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.503
{\an8}- WELL, HONEY, I LOVE YOU.
- GET HOME SAFE.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.505
{\an8}- THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
- LOVE YOU.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.465
{\an8}I HAD SO MUCH FUN TONIGHT
WITH EVERYBODY'S FRIENDS

09:51.549 --> 09:53.050
{\an8}AND FAMILY
AT THE BONFIRE.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.596
{\an8}I'M ITALIAN, AND BIG FAMILY
PARTIES ARE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT,

09:56.679 --> 09:59.765
{\an8}BUT IT'S REALLY BITTERSWEET THAT
THE SUMMER'S COMING TO AN END,

09:59.849 --> 10:01.225
{\an8}BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT
WHEN WE GET HOME,

10:01.309 --> 10:02.101
{\an8}ITS GOING TO BE SAD.

10:02.184 --> 10:05.021
{\an8}- PUTTING THIS FIRE OUT
IS SYMBOLIZATION

10:05.104 --> 10:06.897
{\an8}OF OUR TIME HERE.

10:06.981 --> 10:10.109
{\an8}- FAREWELL PARTY!

10:10.192 --> 10:14.947
{\an8}[alternative music]

10:15.031 --> 10:18.284
{\an8}- ♪ SUMMER MONTHS
HAVE ALL BUT GONE ♪

10:18.367 --> 10:19.535
{\an8}♪ I'M AS LOST
AS I CAN BE ♪

10:19.618 --> 10:22.872
{\an8}- READY FOR THE LAST SHIFT?
- YEP.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.665
{\an8}- SAM!
- COMING.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.167
{\an8}- WE'RE LEAVING!

10:26.250 --> 10:27.543
{\an8}I FEEL SAD TODAY.

10:27.626 --> 10:30.504
{\an8}WE HAVE OUR LAST WORKDAY
AT THE SHORE STORE,

10:30.588 --> 10:31.714
{\an8}OUR LAST SHIFT, AND IT'S JUST
STARTING TO HIT ME

10:31.797 --> 10:34.800
{\an8}THAT IT'S THE LAST TIME
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA WORK HERE.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.719
{\an8}- GUIDOS ARE HERE!
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.220
{\an8}- IT'S THE LAST DAY, MAN.
- I KNOW.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.388
{\an8}- YOU SAD?

10:39.472 --> 10:40.931
{\an8}- OH, I DIDN'T EVEN BRING
A LOLLIPOP TODAY.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.225
{\an8}- TRUST ME, I'M FIGHTING BACK
THE TEARS RIGHT NOW, GUYS.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.144
{\an8}- [laughs] YEAH, RIGHT.
- TEARS OF JOY! [chuckles]

10:45.227 --> 10:46.604
{\an8}- DANNY.
- YES, SIR?

10:46.687 --> 10:48.731
{\an8}- CAN YOU TELL HER
THERE'S NO BIKINIS IN THE STORE?

10:48.814 --> 10:52.026
{\an8}SHE HAS TO REMOVE THAT.
- FOLLOW THE RULES.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.570
{\an8}- [laughs]
SHE ALMOST TOOK IT OFF, BRO.

10:54.653 --> 10:55.738
{\an8}I REALLY,
TRULY AM GOING TO MISS

10:55.821 --> 10:58.657
{\an8}WORKING AT THE T-SHIRT SHOP
AND WORKING WITH DANNY.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.368
{\an8}LIKE, DANNY'S NOW
A PART OF MY LIFE.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.871
{\an8}HE'S MY FRIEND,
AND I'M SICK AT PRESSING SHIRTS.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.456
{\an8}DAMN, I'M GOOD!

11:05.539 --> 11:08.084
{\an8}I SHOULD BE THE MASTER PRESSER
AT THIS STORE,

11:08.167 --> 11:09.794
{\an8}BUT DANNY
DOESN'T WANNA PAY ME.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.088
{\an8}JUST GONNA BE
A DJ INSTEAD.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.422
{\an8}- SO WHY, DANNY, DO YOU KEEP
BRINGING US BACK EVERY YEAR?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.300
{\an8}WE FLIPPED YOUR HOUSE
INSIDE OUT,

11:16.384 --> 11:19.095
{\an8}ALMOST BURNT IT DOWN
AT LEAST THREE TO FOUR TIMES...

11:19.178 --> 11:20.012
{\an8}- YUP.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.265
{\an8}- LEFT IT SMELLING
LIKE A LOBSTER'S VAGINA.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.267
{\an8}- MIKE WAS BRINGING A BUNCH
OF GRENADES IN YOUR HOUSE, BRO.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.686
{\an8}- [groans] DON'T REMIND ME
ABOUT THAT ONE.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.647
{\an8}- I GOTTA BE HONEST.
I DO LOVE YOU GUYS,

11:29.730 --> 11:31.774
{\an8}BUT MIKE DRIVES ME NUTS.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.942
{\an8}[laughter]

11:33.025 --> 11:34.610
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP
TO TONIGHT?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.779
{\an8}- NO IDEA.
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.279
{\an8}- I WANT TO GO
TO YOUR HOME AS WELL.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.366
{\an8}[giggles]
- MIKE!

11:40.449 --> 11:42.660
{\an8}- I WILL NOT MISS DANNY
RIDING ME

11:42.743 --> 11:45.121
{\an8}AT THE SHORE STORE
EVERY TIME I WORK.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.831
{\an8}THIS IS MY LAST SHIFT.
YEAH.

11:46.914 --> 11:47.957
{\an8}- OH, TODAY?
- YEAH.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.625
{\an8}COULD I GET ONE LAST EMBRACE?

11:49.708 --> 11:50.543
{\an8}[sighs]
- PLEASE!

11:50.626 --> 11:53.879
{\an8}- I'M SAYING MY GOOD-BYES,
YOU DICTATOR.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.131
{\an8}ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:55.214 --> 11:57.299
{\an8}THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF WORK,
THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.843
{\an8}WHO DOES ANYTHING
ON THOSE DAYS?

11:58.926 --> 12:00.845
{\an8}- IT'S TIME, GUYS.
IT'S OVER.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.638
{\an8}- LAST DAY OF WORK!
- IT'S BEEN FUN.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.807
{\an8}- SAYING GOOD-BYE TO DANNY
IS DEFINITELY SAD,

12:04.890 --> 12:07.518
{\an8}BUT I FEEL LIKE I'LL ALWAYS
HAVE A HOME AT THE SHORE STORE,

12:07.601 --> 12:09.728
{\an8}YOU KNOW, MAYBE EVEN WHEN
LORENZO'S OLD ENOUGH TO WORK,

12:09.812 --> 12:12.731
{\an8}HE CAN GO TO THE SHORE STORE
AND START WORKING.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.483
{\an8}I DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.943
{\an8}- SEE YOU GUYS LATER.
- BYE, GUYS.

12:16.026 --> 12:19.822
{\an8}- SEE YOU LATER, DANNY.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.700
{\an8}- ME AND SAM
ARE HEADING TANNING,

12:22.783 --> 12:23.951
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY
WE DON'T RUN INTO PAULA.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.036
{\an8}- HI.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.831
{\an8}- SO PAULA LEFT SOMETHING HERE
FOR MIKE.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.498
{\an8}- OH, NO.
- WHAT IS IT?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.667
{\an8}- THEY'RE JUST BIRTHDAY CAKES,

12:31.750 --> 12:33.252
{\an8}I GUESS...
- [sighs]

12:33.335 --> 12:34.003
{\an8}- AND A CARD.
- OH, GOD.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.087
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.922
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DEAL
WITH THIS WHEN WE GET DONE.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.842
{\an8}TOMORROW
IS MIKE'S BIRTHDAY,

12:39.925 --> 12:41.635
{\an8}AND OF COURSE,
THERE'S A NOTE FROM PAULA

12:41.719 --> 12:45.431
{\an8}TO GIVE TO MIKE
WITH CAKES.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.807
{\an8}WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
PAULA?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.517
{\an8}- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THEY'RE BOTH "WHOO,"

12:48.601 --> 12:49.643
{\an8}BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS
RIGHT NOW.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.687
{\an8}I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL MIKE,
BUT NO.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.646
{\an8}LIKE, THIS IS
A LITTLE CRAZY.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.524
{\an8}MIKE MADE PAULA
LOOK LIKE A FOOL,

12:55.608 --> 12:58.068
{\an8}AND NOW, PAULA'S JUST,
LIKE, ACTING LIKE EVERYTHING

12:58.152 --> 12:59.945
{\an8}IS OKAY AND SENDING HIM
A CAKE AND CARD?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.531
{\an8}IT'S JUST, LIKE, TOO MUCH.
LIKE, SLOW YOUR ROLL.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.617
{\an8}LET'S JUST BRING THIS HOME
WITH US.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.035
{\an8}WE'LL LET THEM
FIGURE IT OUT.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.871
{\an8}- BYE, GUYS.
- SEE YA.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.664
{\an8}- IMAGINE MIKE
GETS SICK FROM IT. [laughs]

13:10.748 --> 13:12.374
{\an8}- LET'S STEAL HER BED,
PUT IT UPSTAIRS.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.877
{\an8}- WE OWE SAM A PRANK.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.755
{\an8}DO NOT MESS
WITH THE PRANK WAR CHAMPIONS.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.256
{\an8}- OH, FUCK!
- OH, DAMN, SON!

13:19.340 --> 13:22.718
{\an8}- AW, I'M DEAD.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.934
{\an8}- OH, THE CAKE.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.019
{\an8}HELLO?
- HEY!

13:32.102 --> 13:34.897
{\an8}- GUESS WHAT THIS IS, MIKE.
- WHAT?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.232
{\an8}- THIS IS FOR YOU, MIKE.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.066
{\an8}- HERE YOU GO, MIKE.
WHO DO YOU THINK THAT'S FROM?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.400
{\an8}- IT'S FOR YOU.
- WHAT'S THIS FROM?

13:38.484 --> 13:41.195
{\an8}- TANNING?
- FOR REAL?

13:41.278 --> 13:42.029
{\an8}- YEAH, TANNING.
- PAULA?

13:42.112 --> 13:43.113
{\an8}- PAULA?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.406
{\an8}- OOH, CAN WE SEE?
- WHAT THE HELL?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.200
{\an8}- IS THAT COOKIES, BRO?

13:46.283 --> 13:48.869
{\an8}- YO, YOU COULD DO ABSOLUTELY
ANYTHING TO THAT GIRL, HUH?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.788
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GIVE ME THAT CARD, BRO.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.665
{\an8}- GIVE ME THIS, BRO.
- BRAH!

13:52.748 --> 13:53.916
{\an8}- [laughs]

13:53.999 --> 13:55.584
{\an8}- I HAVEN'T REALLY SPOKEN
TO PAULA FOR A WEEK,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.587
{\an8}BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I KNEW SHE STILL WANTED ME.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.089
{\an8}- "LOVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU
CAN BE A DOUCHE SOMETIMES.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.384
{\an8}J.K., XOXO."

14:03.467 --> 14:04.343
{\an8}- WOW, DOUCHE.
- THANKS, VIN.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.637
{\an8}THANKS FOR RELAYING THE MESSAGE
TO ME, VIN.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.097
{\an8}- PAULA IS DEFINITELY
NOT J.K.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.015
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WITH EVERY "J.K."
COMES A LITTLE TRUTH,

14:10.099 --> 14:11.517

TO PULL A PRANK ON YOU.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.496
{\an8}WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU WANT?

21:29.579 --> 21:31.748
{\an8}- IT'S CALLED FUCKING
APOLOGIZING WHEN YOU MESS UP.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.375
{\an8}- OH, SHIT.
RON AND SAM FIGHT..

21:33.458 --> 21:35.043
{\an8}- HELL, YEAH.
YOU GET THE POPCORN?

21:35.127 --> 21:37.546
{\an8}- THIS IS DOPE.
- LET'S GET SOME POPCORN.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.715
{\an8}WE HAVEN'T HAD
A RON AND SAM FIGHT FOREVER.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.883
{\an8}WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A RON
AND SAM FIGHT ALL YEAR.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.427
{\an8}YO, GET THE PRETZELS.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.553
{\an8}- YOU FUCKED UP LAST NIGHT.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.929
{\an8}WHAT DO I GET?
I GET FUCKING ATTITUDE.

21:46.013 --> 21:46.888
{\an8}- I DON'T REALLY THINK
I FUCKED UP TOO BAD LAST NIGHT.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.807
{\an8}I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, NO.
- NO? NO. OKAY.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.934
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?
- RON AND SAM FIGHT.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.519
{\an8}- IT'S LIKE A BLAST
FROM THE PAST.

21:52.602 --> 21:53.395
{\an8}THIS IS AWESOME.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.896
{\an8}- WHAT DID I SAY
THAT AFFECTED YOU SO MUCH

21:54.980 --> 21:57.107
{\an8}THAT YOU'RE SO ANGRY
WITH ME?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.567
{\an8}- YOUR FUCKING ATTITUDE
THIS MORNING

21:58.650 --> 22:00.110
{\an8}THINKING YOU
DID NOTHING WRONG.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.862
{\an8}YOU FUCKING GET UP,
LIKE ALL FUCKING PREPPY.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.238
{\an8}"I DID FUCKING NOTHING WRONG.

22:03.321 --> 22:05.866
{\an8}"I'LL GET UP,
AND I'LL FUCKING BAKE A CAKE,

22:05.949 --> 22:07.993
{\an8}FUCKING MAKE COOKIES,
GO UNTIL I'M FUCKING DONE."

22:08.076 --> 22:10.245
{\an8}THAT'S THE FUCKING PROBLEM.

22:10.328 --> 22:10.746
{\an8}INSTEAD OF SAYING,
"HEY, BABE--"

22:10.829 --> 22:13.081
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:13.165 --> 22:14.958
{\an8}- WATCHING A MOVIE.
- OH.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.753
{\an8}WHAT MOVIE?
- IT'S A DRAMA.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.254
{\an8}- I WANNA BE
WITH A FUCKING WOMAN

22:19.337 --> 22:20.630
{\an8}THAT--YOU KNOW WHAT,
"I FUCKED UP.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.132
{\an8}I WAS WRONG.
I'M SORRY."

22:22.215 --> 22:23.592
{\an8}YOU DON'T EVEN FUCKING SAY
"HEY, WHAT'S WRONG--"

22:23.675 --> 22:24.134
{\an8}- IF YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT THE FUCK I DO,

22:24.217 --> 22:26.261
{\an8}THEN DON'T BE WITH ME.

22:26.344 --> 22:27.304
{\an8}- SO IF THAT'S THE CHOICE,
THEN WE WON'T BE TOGETHER.

22:27.387 --> 22:28.764
{\an8}- IF THAT'S--
NO, THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.

22:28.847 --> 22:29.890
{\an8}- WE HAVE ONE MORE DAY LEFT.
- IT'S YOUR CHOICE, GOOD.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.266
{\an8}- I DON'T FUCKING HAVE
TO SEE YOU EVER FUCKING AGAIN.

22:31.349 --> 22:32.267
{\an8}- GOOD!
- GOOD, PERFECT.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.061
{\an8}- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

22:34.144 --> 22:34.936
{\an8}- LAST NIGHT, [indistinct],
SO LET'S BREAK UP NOW.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.313
{\an8}IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANNA FUCKING DO IT,

22:36.396 --> 22:38.899
{\an8}I'LL DO IT THAT WAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:38.982 --> 22:41.068
{\an8}THE GRASS IS PROBABLY GREENER
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.402
{\an8}YOU GO FIND OUT.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.612
{\an8}COME BACK TO ME,
AND LET ME KNOW IF I'M HERE.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.740
{\an8}HOW ABOUT THAT?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.118
{\an8}- HOW DID
OUR FUCKED-UP PRANK

22:50.202 --> 22:53.622
{\an8}TURN INTO THEM

22:57.709 --> 22:58.960
{\an8}- SHE'S TELLING EVERYBODY.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.253
{\an8}- I WOULD NEVER
IN A MILLION YEARS

23:00.337 --> 23:01.338
{\an8}THINK THIS GIRL
WOULD DO THIS.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.591
{\an8}- HOW COULD SOMEONE
RUIN A CAKE?

23:10.347 --> 23:12.432
{\an8}- WELL, HOW CAN I FIX THIS?
YOUR BED IS FUCKED.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.517
{\an8}HOW CAN I FIX THIS?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.102
{\an8}- IT'S CALLED
SUCKING UP YOUR PRIDE,

23:15.185 --> 23:17.145

AND FUCKING APOLOGIZING.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.980

BEING IN LOVE IS.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.108

{\an8}I GOT YOU FLOWERS."

23:24.027 --> 23:25.821
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
ORDER A GUY FLOWERS?

23:25.904 --> 23:28.156
{\an8}- NO! WAKE UP,
AND SAY "I'M FUCKING SORRY,"

23:28.240 --> 23:29.658
{\an8}NOT BAKING A FUCKING CAKE.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.826
{\an8}- WHY THE FUCK
WOULD I SAY--

23:30.909 --> 23:33.829
{\an8}- ARE THEY STILL FIGHTING
ABOUT THIS FRICKING MATTRESS?

23:33.912 --> 23:36.331
{\an8}LET IT GO.
IT'S A MATTRESS.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.667
{\an8}- I GET NO FUCKING SLEEP.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.175
{\an8}TAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING ADVICE
SOMETIMES.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.718
{\an8}- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.595
{\an8}- I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT
FUCKING BEEN AMAZING TO YOU

23:50.679 --> 23:52.180
{\an8}IN THIS FUCKING HOUSE.
- OH, MY GOD.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.141
{\an8}I CAN'T EVEN SIT HERE AND SAY.
- OKAY.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.226
{\an8}- I LOVE RON AND DEFINITELY
DON'T WANT TO BE FIGHTING.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.520
{\an8}IT'S JUST, LIKE,
IF WE JUST KEEP FIGHTING

23:58.603 --> 24:00.522
{\an8}OVER STUPID DRAMA,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.566
{\an8}WE NEED TO, LIKE, COMMUNICATE
AND LET THINGS GO.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.985
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE,
AND I'M NOT GONNA GO BACK

24:05.068 --> 24:06.319

{\an8}HONESTLY, LIKE, YOU BLAMING ME
FOR THE FUCKING BED

24:13.243 --> 24:14.536

{\an8}IF THE SITUATIONS
WERE TURNED,

24:15.954 --> 24:16.997
{\an8}WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT,

24:17.080 --> 24:21.376
{\an8}AND OTHER PEOPLE DID, I WOULD
NEVER FUCKING BLAME YOU.

24:21.459 --> 24:24.129

24:32.012 --> 24:36.558
{\an8}ALL RIGHT?

24:40.228 --> 24:40.854
{\an8}- GOOD NIGHT.

AND NOW IT'S, LIKE, THE END,

24:56.786 --> 25:00.665
{\an8}AND IT'S LIKE, I DON'T WANNA
LEAVE THIS HOUSE ON A BAD NOTE.

{\an8}LET'S JUST, "ALL RIGHT,
I MESSED UP. I'M SORRY.

28:28.748 --> 28:31.459
{\an8}THAT'S FUCKED UP, BRO.
LET'S GO PISS ON HER CAR.

28:38.007 --> 28:40.093
{\an8}- YEAH.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.429
{\an8}- PAULA HAD SOME GUY'S BALL SAC
ON THE CRUMB CAKE.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.056
{\an8}- I HAD A PIECE OF IT.
- YOU DID?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.559
{\an8}- DID YOU REALLY?
- YOU ATE THE FUCKING--

28:47.642 --> 28:48.810
{\an8}- I HAVEN'T EATEN CAKE
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

28:48.893 --> 28:52.647
{\an8}THE ONE TIME I DECIDE,
"LET ME SPLURGE A LITTLE,"

28:52.730 --> 28:55.316
{\an8}IT'S A [...]
TEABAGGED BALL CAKE.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.651
{\an8}- AW, MAN.
- FIGURES YOU WOULD EAT IT, YO!

28:56.734 --> 29:00.864
{\an8}- THAT'S FUCKED UP.
I'M NO LONGER TEAM PAULA.

THAT TONIGHT'S OUR LAST NIGHT.

EACH OTHER SOMETIMES,

{\an8}WHEN I SAW NICOLE COME IN
AND YELL, "THE PARTY'S HERE!"

31:34.142 --> 31:35.602

BEING A KID,

31:51.743 --> 31:53.369
{\an8}AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
LEARNING FROM MY MISTAKES

31:53.453 --> 31:54.495
{\an8}AND DOING CRAZY SHIT.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.830
{\an8}I THINK I GREW UP,

31:55.913 --> 31:58.791
{\an8}BUT I STILL FEEL
LIKE I'M THE SAME PERSON.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.418

I'M STILL RETARDED,

32:00.501 --> 32:03.880

BELIEVE THAT.

32:31.199 --> 32:31.783

WHEN WE FELT IT FOR YOU.

{\an8}BUT THE SNOOKI PUNCH
BROUGHT THE HOUSE TOGETHER

IT OPENED OUR EYES

32:42.710 --> 32:45.546

LIKE, FORM AS A FAMILY

- CRAZIEST FIRST DAY.

AND GOT NAKED IN FRONT OF MIKE.

{\an8}- UNDERSTAND HOW BAD
I WANT YOU.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.303
{\an8}- IF YOU GO ON ANOTHER CHICK,
I'LL KILL YOU.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.308
{\an8}YOU HAVE A PIERCED PENIS.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.519
{\an8}I LOVE IT.
- NO ONE KNOWS.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.271
{\an8}- I HAD TO MAN UP TO THAT ONE.
- SHE WAS LIKE, "NO WAY."

33:43.354 --> 33:45.106
{\an8}- THE BEST WAS WHEN WE'RE ALL
ABOUT TO GO TO BED,

33:45.189 --> 33:46.107
{\an8}AND SHE'S LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
I GOTTA CALL MY BOYFRIEND,"

33:46.190 --> 33:48.109
{\an8}AND WE'RE LIKE, "YO, WHAT?"
- [chuckles] WHAT?

33:48.192 --> 33:49.360
{\an8}- ME AND YOU LOOKED
AT EACH OTHER LIKE...

33:49.444 --> 33:50.778
{\an8}- A FUCKING BOYFRIEND?

33:50.862 --> 33:53.281
{\an8}- SORRY.
I HAD A CRUSH ON PAULY.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.700
{\an8}I WASN'T TRYING TO BLOW IT UP
THE FIRST NIGHT.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.327
{\an8}TOM ENDED UP BEING A DOUCHE
ANYWAYS, SO I'M GLAD.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.704

THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU

33:59.787 --> 34:01.456
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU MET ROGER.
- YEAH.

{\an8}MEETING THE PERSON I PLAN
TO BE WITH

34:02.415 --> 34:06.169
{\an8}FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
IS ANOTHER REASON

34:06.252 --> 34:09.338
{\an8}WHY THE JERSEY SHORE

34:11.424 --> 34:13.509
{\an8}HAVING A FOREVER FUTURE.

34:13.592 --> 34:15.428

ONE RULE OF THIS HOUSE.

34:15.511 --> 34:16.721
{\an8}- DON'T FALL IN LOVE
AT THE JERSEY SHORE.

34:16.804 --> 34:17.764

34:24.228 --> 34:25.062
{\an8}- NO.
