WEBVTT

01:23.596 --> 01:24.876
One, two, three, four, five, six

01:25.598 --> 01:28.533
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve

01:28.601 --> 01:29.101
Okay.

01:56.629 --> 01:58.824
Auditions for Miss Jackson
step rehearsals.

01:59.632 --> 02:07.632
Step rehearsals will meet
in room 326 after school today.

02:22.655 --> 02:23.155
Aww.

02:28.661 --> 02:29.855
What is history?

02:30.663 --> 02:31.163
Opposites.

02:31.664 --> 02:33.598
You can read the board.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.601
I'm so happy to hear that.

02:36.669 --> 02:37.601
No, what is it?

02:37.670 --> 02:38.670
What does it mean? Stace?

02:38.671 --> 02:40.605
Change?

02:40.673 --> 02:41.867
Thank you, Stacey.

02:42.675 --> 02:44.395
I'm glad to hear
someone's paying attention.

02:44.677 --> 02:48.613
History is the study
Of change over time.

02:48.681 --> 02:49.875
And what's change?

02:50.683 --> 02:52.617
It's this. It's opposites.

02:52.685 --> 02:55.882
It's two things that push against
each other in opposite directions.

02:56.689 --> 02:58.884
So the civil rights movement,
okay, it's essentially,

02:59.692 --> 03:01.626
It's two opposing mentalities.

03:01.694 --> 03:04.663
In the south, the majority believes

03:04.731 --> 03:05.891
All men are not created equal,
and there's a minority

03:06.699 --> 03:08.894
Who believes that they are,
so that minority struggles

03:09.702 --> 03:12.637
and it fights and it pushes
till eventually

03:12.705 --> 03:14.900
It becomes the majority.

03:15.708 --> 03:17.903
Am I boring you? Huh?

03:18.711 --> 03:22.647
Let's give you some examples,
okay, of opposing forces,

03:22.715 --> 03:24.910
Like I'm going to go night and day.

03:25.718 --> 03:26.650
What else?

03:26.719 --> 03:27.651
Big and little.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.654
Good. Anything else?

03:29.722 --> 03:30.654
Left and right.

03:32.725 --> 03:33.657
You and I.

03:33.726 --> 03:35.660
You and I.

03:35.728 --> 03:37.008
Teacher, student. Anything else?

03:37.730 --> 03:38.924
Yeah.

03:39.732 --> 03:40.926
Just wondering if you could count me and
Gina's bald-headed sister as opposites.

03:41.734 --> 03:43.668
Oh, insult.

03:47.740 --> 03:48.934
Gina come on, tell me you're not
going to take that?

03:49.742 --> 03:52.677
You got a bald sister?
Is your sister bald?

03:52.745 --> 03:53.712
Give me something.

03:53.780 --> 03:54.940
May 17, 1954.

03:55.748 --> 03:58.683
Oh.

04:03.756 --> 04:05.156
And I expect some thought from you.

04:05.758 --> 04:07.692
I don't want just dates and facts.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.694
I want to know why.
I want to know consequences.

04:09.762 --> 04:12.697
I want to know what it means. All right.

04:12.765 --> 04:14.699
Now, back to the bald sister.

04:16.769 --> 04:17.701
What's going on with that?

04:17.769 --> 04:18.964
Right.

04:19.939 --> 04:23.705
Left. Back.

04:24.777 --> 04:26.711
I'm shooting.

04:26.779 --> 04:28.713
You got your girl open over here.

04:28.781 --> 04:30.421
She's sending out smoke signals
over here.

04:30.783 --> 04:32.717
She's got the fire.

04:32.819 --> 04:37.984
She's going I got it over here
and you're like-

04:38.791 --> 04:41.760
Come on, get open. Oh, yeah.

04:41.828 --> 04:43.989
Drey?

04:44.797 --> 04:46.731
You going to put that down
and come play or what?

04:46.799 --> 04:50.997
I ain't done yet, Coach.

04:51.804 --> 04:53.844
All right, top of the key,
three passes, here we go.

05:14.861 --> 05:18.763
Thursday, 11:16 a. m.

05:18.831 --> 05:21.026
Hello, this is Taylor calling
from Consolidated Credit.

05:21.834 --> 05:22.766
This is an urgent message
For Mr. Daniel Dunn

05:22.835 --> 05:24.235
Regarding your outstanding balance.

05:25.838 --> 05:29.774
Thursday, 5:25 p. m.

05:29.842 --> 05:34.779
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.
I'm in town for a while.

05:34.847 --> 05:40.046
You know, my Mom, anyway,
I know it's been forever,

05:40.853 --> 05:43.788
But I'd really like to see you.

05:43.856 --> 05:45.790
I don't know.

05:45.892 --> 05:48.053
I'll be at my parents
so give me a call, okay?

05:48.861 --> 05:50.055
Bye.

05:50.863 --> 05:55.061
Thursday, 5:25 p. m.

05:55.868 --> 05:57.062
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.

07:06.939 --> 07:07.871
I like Oprah.

07:07.940 --> 07:10.135
I love Oprah.

07:10.943 --> 07:13.584
But the thing is I was just fucking
things up just to fuck them up.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.880
Right, right. No.

07:16.048 --> 07:16.878
Right.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.142
Yeah.

07:19.952 --> 07:22.887
Right, because everything that is worth-

07:22.955 --> 07:23.887
Right, just forget it.
So you're a teacher?

07:23.990 --> 07:24.942
I'm a teacher.

07:33.966 --> 07:36.286
And what am I supposed To teach
them, you know what I mean?

07:36.969 --> 07:38.903
Right.

07:38.971 --> 07:39.903
That's the point, you know what I mean?

07:39.972 --> 07:40.904
Yeah.

07:41.974 --> 07:42.906
Yeah.

07:43.976 --> 07:45.170
If you can change one person-

07:45.978 --> 07:47.172
Then you can change them all.

07:48.114 --> 07:49.911
I want to dance.

07:53.119 --> 07:53.915
I want to dance.

07:53.986 --> 08:00.221
Let's dance.

08:22.014 --> 08:22.981
What's going on, bro?

08:23.049 --> 08:25.210
What's the word?

08:26.018 --> 08:27.952
What's that?

08:28.020 --> 08:29.954
What, this right here? Mm-hmm.

08:30.022 --> 08:32.217
Some new street shit.

08:33.025 --> 08:41.025
Go ahead, man, check it out.

08:43.034 --> 08:45.970
You got to feel that shit.

08:46.205 --> 08:47.229
Yeah, it's not bad.

08:49.041 --> 08:52.238
That's the street shit.

08:53.045 --> 08:54.979
So what you need, teach, another eighth?

08:55.081 --> 08:57.242
I only got 30.

08:58.050 --> 08:59.244
Word.

09:00.052 --> 09:01.986
It's been a long week.

09:02.054 --> 09:08.254
You want that other thing?

09:09.061 --> 09:12.997
On may 17, 1954, The supreme court ruled

09:13.065 --> 09:15.260
On the case of Brown
versus Board of Education,

09:16.068 --> 09:19.003
Making it illegal for states
to segregate public schools.

09:19.105 --> 09:20.865
This was a major step forward
in the struggle

09:21.040 --> 09:22.440
For racial justice and helped begin

09:23.075 --> 09:26.010
A flurry of bold and heroic actions

09:26.078 --> 09:34.078
Known as the Civil Rights Movement.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.034
Get on her. Sally, get on her.

09:50.102 --> 09:58.102
It's all right, Sally. Come on.

10:24.136 --> 10:27.333
Come on.

10:28.140 --> 10:36.140
Ballgame, ladies. Ballgame.

10:53.165 --> 11:01.165
Okay. Good job.

11:03.175 --> 11:06.372
I like our chances Against Saint Joseph.

11:07.179 --> 11:08.111
The thing is if we could just
Figure out a way to put the ball

11:08.180 --> 11:10.375
In the hoop it would be fine.

11:11.183 --> 11:14.118
Stace, good job tonight.

11:14.186 --> 11:15.380
Thank you.

11:16.188 --> 11:18.188
You did a great job.
Is there anyone else in there?

11:18.190 --> 11:20.124
No, that's it.

11:20.192 --> 11:21.124
Thanks for tonight.

11:21.193 --> 11:26.995
All right. Bye, Mr. Dunn.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.403
What are you doing here?

11:40.212 --> 11:44.148
I heard this was the place.

11:44.216 --> 11:48.152
We need a little work,
But we're having fun so, yeah.

11:48.220 --> 11:54.159
How are you?

11:54.260 --> 11:57.423
Same old, same old.

11:58.230 --> 12:00.164
I'm happy to see you.

12:00.232 --> 12:05.431
It's good to see you too. You look good.

12:06.238 --> 12:09.173
Come on, I got fat.

12:09.241 --> 12:17.241
Oh, I know, but it looks great.
You look healthy.

12:19.251 --> 12:20.445
Do you want to go get some-

12:21.220 --> 12:22.448
I can't. I got to-

12:24.256 --> 12:25.450
To get some coffee?

12:26.258 --> 12:27.452
Yeah.

12:28.260 --> 12:31.457
I can't tonight.

12:32.264 --> 12:34.459
Do you want to do it Another night?

12:35.267 --> 12:35.767
Okay.

12:45.277 --> 12:53.277
Hey, how's your Mom?

12:56.322 --> 13:04.322
Did you get my messages?

13:14.306 --> 13:22.306
Hello? I'm coming in.

13:24.316 --> 13:24.816
Anyone?

15:16.428 --> 15:24.428
Somebody in there?

15:40.452 --> 15:42.386
Oh, sorry.

15:42.454 --> 15:43.270
That's okay.

15:50.462 --> 15:56.401
It's okay. I'm fine.

15:56.468 --> 16:01.667
I'm sorry.

16:02.474 --> 16:06.672
Are you okay?

16:07.479 --> 16:15.479
Can you help me up?

16:30.502 --> 16:33.699
Are you okay?

16:34.506 --> 16:36.440
Yeah.

16:36.508 --> 16:41.445
Okay, good.

16:41.513 --> 16:49.513
It's gonna be fine.

16:50.522 --> 16:51.270
Some water?

16:59.531 --> 17:07.531
I'm sorry, but I'm fine.

17:27.559 --> 17:32.758
Just don't go, okay, Just for a minute?

17:33.565 --> 17:36.762
Just for a minute?

17:59.591 --> 18:07.591
See you tomorrow?

20:57.769 --> 21:03.708
Hey, kiddo.

21:03.775 --> 21:05.970
How's Darrel's leg healing?

21:06.778 --> 21:07.972
I don't know.

21:08.780 --> 21:10.975
You didn't go to the hospital?

21:11.783 --> 21:14.980
No.

21:15.787 --> 21:17.721
Did your father pick you up
from practice last night, Drey?

21:17.789 --> 21:20.724
No.

21:20.792 --> 21:22.987
Fucking shit. How did you get home?

21:25.797 --> 21:27.731
Coach.

21:27.799 --> 21:30.734
I'm tired of this.
Something has got to change.

21:30.802 --> 21:31.996
I don't know what.

21:32.804 --> 21:37.002
You don't got to worry about me.

21:37.809 --> 21:39.003
Oh, look at you, Miss 12.

21:39.811 --> 21:41.005
Thirteen, I'm 13 now.

21:41.813 --> 21:44.748
Oh, so you grown, huh?

21:44.816 --> 21:46.750
Going to take care of yourself,
Is that it?

21:46.818 --> 21:49.013
Pretty much.

21:49.821 --> 21:50.810
Well, that's a relief.

21:50.889 --> 21:58.889
I guess I ain't got to cook up
these burgers then, huh?

21:59.831 --> 22:02.072
Hey, Mom, you know this dude
Cesar Chavez on Spanish Six?

22:02.834 --> 22:04.028
Cesar who?

22:04.836 --> 22:08.772
Cesar Chavez.
He once fasted for 35 days.

22:08.874 --> 22:11.775
That means he didn't eat For 35 days,

22:12.844 --> 22:14.038
Mm-hmm.

22:14.846 --> 22:15.806
Think you could do that?

22:28.860 --> 22:30.054
Hi, honey, it's Mom.

23:13.939 --> 23:21.846
Hello? Hi, um, is Rachel there?

23:42.934 --> 23:45.869
Well, I feel good today.

23:45.937 --> 23:49.134
Anyone else feel good? Hmm?

23:49.941 --> 23:55.140
I need a volunteer, and I need
somebody who feels strong.

23:55.947 --> 23:58.882
So what we've got here
Is two opposing forces,

23:58.950 --> 24:01.885
Terrence and myself, and we're
pushing against each other.

24:01.987 --> 24:04.228
And as long as one is stronger-
and it looks like it's t-

24:04.956 --> 24:08.892
The change is slow and consistent.

24:08.994 --> 24:11.690
But once the other side
becomes stronger,

24:16.968 --> 24:18.162
There's a turning point.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.164
Thank you, T. Make sense?

24:20.972 --> 24:22.166
Okay.

24:22.941 --> 24:24.909
Now, turning points
can happen like that.

24:24.976 --> 24:32.976
They can be physical, or they
can happen on a greater scale,

24:35.987 --> 24:37.181
Like a war or something.

24:37.989 --> 24:41.186
So why don't you do me a favor and write

24:41.993 --> 24:43.927
Three examples
Of historical turning points

24:43.995 --> 24:51.995
That we've talked about in class, okay?

24:53.004 --> 24:55.199
What's up?

24:56.007 --> 25:04.007
Have you even opened the
Civil Rights binder I gave you?

25:08.019 --> 25:14.948
The Civil Rights binder I have opened,

25:15.026 --> 25:17.961
and it's got some great stuff in it.

25:18.029 --> 25:20.964
I think it's great. Yeah.

25:21.032 --> 25:22.752
I'm just providing
a little general content-

25:23.034 --> 25:27.232
I need you on the civil rights
Section by next week.

25:28.039 --> 25:28.971
Nice seeing you.

25:29.040 --> 25:37.040
Is that gum in your mouth?

25:49.060 --> 25:52.257
He was a Gemini. He was so cocky.

25:53.064 --> 25:55.999
Every day I saw him he used to
go like, oh, you happy you got me.

25:56.067 --> 25:57.507
You happy you got me, and I be like,

25:58.069 --> 26:00.270
Please you the one that's got
me, so y'all like Geminis?

26:01.072 --> 26:03.006
Oh, what's his name?

26:03.074 --> 26:05.269
Mr. Easton and Mrs. Wright
In the movie theater.

26:06.077 --> 26:07.517
I'm pretty sure they're married. No.

26:08.079 --> 26:09.273
I don't, they can't.

26:10.081 --> 26:11.013
You don't know what you're
talking about, so don't talk.

26:11.082 --> 26:12.014
No, but they look weird together.

26:12.117 --> 26:13.397
Y'all think Mr. Dunn is married?

26:15.086 --> 26:17.020
Would you want to marry him?

26:17.088 --> 26:18.020
Come in the room,
swirling his finger around,

26:18.089 --> 26:19.021
Telling us to move the desk.

26:19.090 --> 26:21.024
Why can't he move the desk?

26:21.092 --> 26:23.026
I'm getting tired of that every morning.

26:23.094 --> 26:24.334
Don't forget about his glasses.

26:25.096 --> 26:26.290
And he... bifocals.

26:27.098 --> 26:30.295
He start Throwing them
around, throwing the chalk.

26:31.102 --> 26:32.069
Like he all cool and fly
and everything, but-

26:32.137 --> 26:32.716
Ridley?

26:32.751 --> 26:33.295
Quiet.

26:35.106 --> 26:38.041
Would you marry your father? Oh.

26:38.109 --> 26:40.043
"A man who was curious to know
If a knife could penetrate

26:40.111 --> 26:41.751
"his bulletproof vest
Was killed yesterday

26:42.113 --> 26:43.045
"by a stab wound to the chest.

26:43.114 --> 26:45.309
"Witnesses say the man, Jeff Turner, 32,

26:46.117 --> 26:52.056
"urged his brother,
Scott Turner, 35, to stab him

26:52.123 --> 26:56.321
"as hard as he could, believing
The vest would stop the knife.

26:57.128 --> 26:57.876
It didn't."

27:06.137 --> 27:08.332
So how's Your opposite somethings?

27:09.140 --> 27:11.074
Pretty good.

27:11.142 --> 27:13.337
Where'd you come up with that stuff?

27:14.145 --> 27:15.339
It's just a little something
I picked up in college.

27:16.147 --> 27:17.748
A little thick for the eighth grade, no?

27:18.149 --> 27:20.029
Yeah, yeah, well, you'd think,
but I don't know.

27:20.151 --> 27:23.348
I think they're getting it.

27:25.156 --> 27:29.092
You know, Drey is so textbook.

27:29.194 --> 27:31.355
How's your book?

27:32.163 --> 27:34.358
Don't ask.

27:35.166 --> 27:37.100
There's always the summer.

27:37.168 --> 27:38.100
Do you want to go?

27:42.173 --> 27:43.693
You want to have dinner with me again?

27:44.175 --> 27:47.372
Okay. Mm-hmm?

27:48.179 --> 27:50.113
Did you guys hear that they found

27:50.181 --> 27:51.461
A crack vial in the locker room?

27:52.183 --> 27:54.378
Jesus.

27:55.186 --> 27:56.380
Hmm.

27:58.189 --> 28:01.124
Whose it is? Oh, I don't know.

28:01.192 --> 28:03.387
Hey, you know what? That's a good idea.

28:04.195 --> 28:05.389
We can put it in the lost and
found to see if anybody claims it.

28:06.197 --> 28:14.197
Better yet, why don't we put up
flyers with a picture?

28:26.217 --> 28:27.149
What's new?

28:27.218 --> 28:29.413
I don't know.

28:30.221 --> 28:36.160
I can't hear you. Come over here.

28:36.227 --> 28:38.195
That's a nice cap.

28:38.263 --> 28:39.423
Thanks. It's Mike's.

28:40.231 --> 28:45.168
Yeah, I know. Talk to him lately?

28:45.236 --> 28:47.431
He writes sometimes.

28:48.239 --> 28:50.173
How's he doing in there?

28:50.241 --> 28:52.175
All right, I guess.

28:52.243 --> 28:54.177
Well, if he needs something,
Let me know, all right?

28:54.245 --> 28:55.485
I mean, I know people in there.

28:57.248 --> 29:00.183
Okay.

29:00.251 --> 29:02.185
Okay?

29:02.253 --> 29:03.185
Yeah.

29:03.254 --> 29:11.254
All right then.

29:12.263 --> 29:17.200
What, you thirsty, huh?
You want something to drink?

29:17.268 --> 29:18.462
My bike.

29:19.270 --> 29:27.270
Ain't nobody going
to fuck with that bike.

29:28.279 --> 29:32.215
Yo Harvey, this is Drey. Hey, Tina?

29:32.283 --> 29:34.124
You remember Mike's
little sister, Drey, right?

29:34.285 --> 29:35.252
Oh, hey, sweetie.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.483
Come and sit down.
Let me get that juice for you.

29:39.290 --> 29:41.485
Help yourself. Come on and sit.

29:42.293 --> 29:50.293
I'll be right back.

30:27.338 --> 30:30.535
Yo, pick a hand.

30:32.343 --> 30:37.280
Ha, you lose.

30:37.382 --> 30:39.282
Come on. What's up with that juice?

30:39.350 --> 30:41.545
I'm not thirsty.

30:42.353 --> 30:44.287
Well, don't be a stranger, kid.

30:44.355 --> 30:45.835
You could stop through and say hello.

30:46.357 --> 30:46.857
Yeah.

31:02.373 --> 31:03.567
You saw Frank today?

31:04.375 --> 31:12.375
Just ran into him.

31:32.403 --> 31:36.601
On September 13, 1971,
1200 Attica state prison inmates

31:37.408 --> 31:39.209
Seized control of the prison
and took hostages

31:39.410 --> 31:43.608
To negotiate changes
to their inhumane conditions.

31:44.415 --> 31:46.610
Governor Nelson Rockefeller
ordered a military assault

31:47.418 --> 31:51.354
On the prison which killed
29 inmates and 10 hostages,

31:51.422 --> 31:53.617
Every one caused from police gunshots.

31:54.425 --> 31:57.360
An official commission later
Stated, with the exception

31:57.428 --> 31:59.623
Of indian massacres
In the late 19th century,

32:00.431 --> 32:03.366
The police assault was
the bloodiest one-day encounter

32:03.434 --> 32:06.369
Between Americans Since the civil war.

32:57.488 --> 33:02.425
Unbelievable. What are you doing?

33:02.493 --> 33:10.423
Go sit in the desk. Ten points off.

33:10.501 --> 33:13.436
Second chances are rare, man.

33:13.504 --> 33:17.440
You ought to take
better advantage of them.

33:17.508 --> 33:21.706
Don't let go.
Grab the t-shirt if you need to.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.448
You know, a little elbow here
and there never killed anybody,

33:24.515 --> 33:25.709
You know what I mean?

33:26.517 --> 33:30.715
As long as the ref isn't looking.

33:31.522 --> 33:33.490
Not in my house.

34:07.558 --> 34:08.918
It's a nice surprise. Where's Mom?

34:09.560 --> 34:10.754
Working.

34:11.562 --> 34:13.757
Darrel's uncle came to visit
so I came along with him.

34:14.565 --> 34:15.759
How's Darrel's leg?

34:16.567 --> 34:18.762
It's all right.

34:19.570 --> 34:22.766
It's nice to see you.

34:23.574 --> 34:26.771
Those for me?

34:27.578 --> 34:28.510
Frank's for sending me
some of them nasty peppermints

34:28.579 --> 34:29.511
He always eating.

34:29.580 --> 34:30.774
What is that?

34:31.581 --> 34:37.521
I threw them shits out.

34:37.588 --> 34:38.554
So how's the team?

34:38.623 --> 34:40.784
We suck.

34:41.592 --> 34:44.527
And Ma, still working too hard?

34:44.594 --> 34:45.789
Yeah.

34:46.597 --> 34:49.532
But she all right for money though.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.534
Frank still looking out?

34:53.603 --> 34:55.799
Good.

34:56.607 --> 35:01.806
He owes us.

35:02.613 --> 35:04.808
So how come you never told on him?

35:05.616 --> 35:09.552
For what?

35:09.620 --> 35:11.060
Would've made shit more complicated.

35:11.622 --> 35:17.822
And shit was already fucked up
as it is, you know?

35:18.629 --> 35:20.824
That's all in the past, though.

35:21.632 --> 35:24.829
I'm going to get out of here.
You'll see.

35:25.636 --> 35:28.571
I mean, you got Russell Simmons
On the case.

35:28.639 --> 35:34.839
Russell Simmons?

35:35.646 --> 35:40.583
Look, we'll be all right.

35:48.659 --> 35:50.299
I have to write
an essay about growing up.

35:51.662 --> 35:52.856
I'm going to fail the course.

35:53.664 --> 35:55.859
Well, that's your problem, Charles.

35:56.667 --> 35:57.599
My problem is making sure
that you keep an eye on things

35:57.668 --> 35:58.862
While I'm gone.

35:59.670 --> 36:01.865
Actually that's also your problem.

36:02.673 --> 36:03.605
You've got a lot Of problems, Charles.

36:03.674 --> 36:09.874
Don't let them get
in the way of your work.

36:10.681 --> 36:13.616
There's a time when
the operation of the machine

36:13.684 --> 36:16.653
Becomes so odious,
makes you so sick at heart

36:16.721 --> 36:17.881
That you can't take part.

36:18.689 --> 36:21.624
You can't even passively
take part, and you've got

36:21.692 --> 36:23.887
To put your bodies upon
the gears and upon the wheels,

36:24.695 --> 36:26.890
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus

36:27.698 --> 36:30.633
and you've got to make it stop,
and you've got to indicate

36:30.701 --> 36:32.661
to the people who run it,
to the people who own it

36:32.703 --> 36:33.897
that unless you're free,
the machine will be prevented

36:34.705 --> 36:37.640
from working at all.

36:37.708 --> 36:41.303
What is this machine
that he's talking about?

36:42.246 --> 36:43.567
It's keeping us down. What is it?

36:43.714 --> 36:46.649
Like robots and stuff, right?

36:46.717 --> 36:48.912
It could be robots.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.655
It could be robots,
but let's say it's a metaphor.

36:52.723 --> 36:54.443
He's saying this machine
is keeping me down.

36:54.725 --> 36:56.920
Now, what is that?
What keeps us from being free?

36:57.728 --> 36:59.662
Ms. Drey?

36:59.730 --> 37:01.925
Prisons.

37:02.733 --> 37:06.669
Absolutely, absolutely. Prisons, okay?

37:06.737 --> 37:08.177
Prisons are definitely a part of it.

37:08.739 --> 37:11.674
White.

37:12.743 --> 37:14.677
The man.

37:15.746 --> 37:16.713
The school, exactly.

37:16.814 --> 37:17.940
The whole education system
is part of the machine.

37:18.749 --> 37:19.943
What else?

37:20.751 --> 37:21.945
Aren't you the machine then?

37:22.720 --> 37:24.120
Oh, no, you didn't. What'd you say?

37:24.755 --> 37:25.949
Aren't you the machine?

37:26.757 --> 37:27.957
You're saying I'm the machine?

37:28.759 --> 37:30.954
Yeah, you're white.
You're part of the school.

37:31.762 --> 37:33.123
Oh, yeah, I guess you got a point.

37:33.764 --> 37:35.284
All right, so I'm part of the machine,

37:35.766 --> 37:37.700
But if I'm part of it so are you.

37:37.768 --> 37:39.702
You are, too. We all are.

37:40.771 --> 37:42.966
Everything is made with opposing force.

37:43.774 --> 37:45.708
We may be opposed to the machine,

37:45.776 --> 37:47.971
But we're still very much
a part of it, right?

37:48.779 --> 37:51.714
I work for the government,
the school, but I'm also

37:51.782 --> 37:53.462
very much opposed
to a lot of its policies.

37:54.785 --> 37:56.719
Yes.

38:01.792 --> 38:04.727
Sometimes, exactly.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.734
Where you headed?

38:11.836 --> 38:13.397
You look like you're in a rush. Hungry?

38:13.804 --> 38:16.739
I'm starving.

38:16.807 --> 38:19.742
Come on. Burger's on me.

38:19.810 --> 38:21.004
So how's school?

38:21.812 --> 38:23.746
It's hard.

38:24.815 --> 38:25.747
I got a game tomorrow.

38:25.816 --> 38:26.316
Word.

38:30.821 --> 38:32.015
Want to come?

38:33.824 --> 38:34.756
Working.

38:34.825 --> 38:37.020
Pops?

38:37.828 --> 38:38.760
Fuck it. I'll come through.

38:38.829 --> 38:45.029
Somebody got to represent.

38:45.836 --> 38:50.773
Tina packed some sweets
For Mike last night.

38:50.841 --> 38:55.039
Your brother was a good friend,
still is.

38:55.846 --> 38:58.041
That dude was funny.

38:58.849 --> 39:00.783
I mean, he ever showed you
the chicken walk?

39:00.851 --> 39:02.045
The what?

39:03.854 --> 39:08.791
I mean, I can't do it, But it's like-

39:13.864 --> 39:21.794
- shit was bananas.

39:21.872 --> 39:26.070
You know, we used
to work together, right?

39:26.877 --> 39:34.877
You ever think about working?

39:35.886 --> 39:37.080
Shit. I used to work here.

39:37.888 --> 39:40.083
For real?

39:40.891 --> 39:45.828
$150 a week. Hey, Keesha?

39:45.896 --> 39:46.828
What's up, hon?

39:46.897 --> 39:49.161
We need two milkshakes, baby.

40:11.922 --> 40:14.857
I know I don't sound sincere,
but I mean it.

40:15.059 --> 40:16.856
Thank you.

40:16.927 --> 40:17.859
I think I-

40:17.928 --> 40:20.123
Why can't I say that sincerely?

40:20.931 --> 40:23.126
Oh, you can. I went back to school.

40:23.934 --> 40:25.128
Mm-hmm.

40:25.936 --> 40:26.925
Environmental Policy.

40:27.037 --> 40:28.868
No, I know, but I think
you're really going to be great.

40:28.939 --> 40:30.873
I believed you the first time.

40:30.941 --> 40:34.877
I'm just nervous that's all.

40:34.945 --> 40:36.139
How are you?

40:36.947 --> 40:39.882
I don't know.

40:39.950 --> 40:44.148
You still rocking out?

40:44.955 --> 40:51.884
When the occasion calls.

40:51.962 --> 40:52.462
Yeah.

41:06.977 --> 41:08.911
Who's the lucky guy?

41:08.979 --> 41:15.179
I met him in the program.

41:15.986 --> 41:19.183
I don't know, Dan.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.924
Some people change.
Some people actually change.

41:22.960 --> 41:23.927
I know.

41:23.994 --> 41:27.191
No way. I'm still an asshole.

41:27.998 --> 41:34.198
You're not an asshole.
You're just a big baby.

41:35.005 --> 41:41.205
I'm a big asshole baby.

41:59.029 --> 42:00.963
Let's go, rebels.

42:01.031 --> 42:04.967
Pass it in.

42:05.035 --> 42:06.969
All right, there you go.

42:07.071 --> 42:08.231
Blue ball.

42:09.039 --> 42:10.319
What is that? You're killing us.

42:11.041 --> 42:11.973
You need to watch yourself.
Another bad call, hear?

42:12.042 --> 42:13.236
Blue ball.

42:14.044 --> 42:15.978
Walk it off, baby, Walk it
off. Come on, shake it off.

42:16.046 --> 42:20.983
Hustle back.

42:21.051 --> 42:29.051
That was a bad call, man.

42:33.063 --> 42:34.997
You okay?

42:35.065 --> 42:35.565
Yeah.

42:44.074 --> 42:47.271
You want a ride home tonight
after the game?

42:48.078 --> 42:48.758
All right.

43:00.090 --> 43:04.288
Foul, foul, call the foul.

43:05.095 --> 43:06.255
Coach, go back to your bench.

43:07.097 --> 43:08.029
Go back to your bench.

43:08.098 --> 43:09.030
All the foul. All it.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.032
All the foul.

43:11.101 --> 43:12.702
This is fucking bullshit
and you know it.

43:13.103 --> 43:14.035
You're gone, coach.

43:14.104 --> 43:16.299
I won't tolerate that language
on my court.

43:17.107 --> 43:18.039
Oh, it's the language
you don't tolerate,

43:18.108 --> 43:19.040
Fucking language, excuse me.

43:19.143 --> 43:26.049
I didn't know it was the language.

43:26.116 --> 43:34.116
All right. Good luck, girls.

43:37.127 --> 43:40.324
I think your hand is changing
colors get more ice on it.

43:41.131 --> 43:44.066
You should've seen the wall.

43:44.134 --> 43:45.328
I'm telling you, Dunn, you
should've knocked that nigga out.

43:46.136 --> 43:49.333
You can't go around
knocking people out, you know,

43:50.140 --> 43:53.075
Or throwing balls at them
just because you're upset.

43:53.143 --> 43:54.075
It would've felt good, though, right,

43:54.178 --> 43:56.339
Felt good to just get it out.

43:57.147 --> 43:58.627
There's other ways of getting it out.

43:59.149 --> 44:04.348
Right. Like you do?

44:05.155 --> 44:10.092
Look, just because you know
that one thing about me,

44:10.160 --> 44:18.160
One thing doesn't make a man.

44:22.172 --> 44:24.106
What?

44:24.174 --> 44:28.372
One thing doesn't make a man?

44:29.179 --> 44:31.139
You know I was just talking
about your hand right?

44:31.181 --> 44:33.115
Yeah.

44:33.183 --> 44:40.112
Yeah, I knew that.

44:40.190 --> 44:45.127
Hey, who was that guy
that was cheering for you?

44:45.195 --> 44:46.389
Do you know him?

44:47.197 --> 44:51.395
Not really. Do you?

44:52.202 --> 44:52.702
No.

44:57.207 --> 44:58.139
So we can just keep the whole
punching the wall thing

44:58.208 --> 44:59.402
A secret, right?

45:00.210 --> 45:08.210
You don't have to tell anybody, right?

45:27.237 --> 45:35.237
What's up, Santa Claus? Where you going?

46:09.279 --> 46:17.279
I had a good day.

46:18.288 --> 46:20.222
Even after the dolphin report, right?

46:20.290 --> 46:22.485
Even after it says there are no weapons.

46:23.293 --> 46:26.228
There are no WMD programs.
There is nothing.

46:26.296 --> 46:27.228
They do that, The Pippa study,

46:27.297 --> 46:28.658
That University Of Maryland thing,

46:29.299 --> 46:31.494
and turns out 72 percent
Of his supporters

46:32.302 --> 46:35.499
Still believe there's WMDs.

46:36.306 --> 46:40.242
Seventy-five percent
still believe they're supporting

46:40.310 --> 46:44.508
Al Qaeda and so what
the fuck do we do you know?

46:45.315 --> 46:46.509
What do you do?

46:47.317 --> 46:50.252
What does one, I'm one man,
what I do, you know?

46:50.354 --> 46:52.515
I used to be so fucked up.

46:53.323 --> 46:55.257
I used to be so fucked up
I was just out there, you know,

46:55.325 --> 46:58.260
But I fucking cleaned up.

46:58.328 --> 46:59.212
I cleaned up-

47:07.337 --> 47:08.269
For the most part.

47:08.338 --> 47:10.272
I do it now to get by,
but I can handle it.

47:10.340 --> 47:13.275
You know what I mean?

47:13.343 --> 47:15.277
I tried the rehab thing. I tried it.

47:15.345 --> 47:18.280
It didn't work. It didn't work.

47:18.348 --> 47:22.546
You know, it works for some people.

47:23.353 --> 47:31.353
My ex-girlfriend is getting married.

47:35.365 --> 47:37.560
So it works for some people, right?

47:38.368 --> 47:40.302
It didn't work for me.

47:40.370 --> 47:47.572
The kids keep me focused, and I-

48:34.424 --> 48:40.056
Number three: Change moves
in spirals, not circles.

48:41.031 --> 48:47.368
For example, the sun goes up
and then it comes down,

48:47.437 --> 48:52.374
But every time that happens
what do you get?

48:52.442 --> 49:00.442
You get a new day. You get a new one.

49:02.452 --> 49:07.651
When you breathe, you inhale
and then you exhale,

49:08.458 --> 49:12.394
But every single time that you do that

49:12.496 --> 49:17.399
You're a little bit different
than the one before.

49:17.467 --> 49:22.404
We're always changing,
and it's important to know

49:22.472 --> 49:24.667
That there are some changes
you can't control

49:25.475 --> 49:28.410
But that there are others you can.

49:35.485 --> 49:38.420
Any students who did not turn
in their Hall of Science

49:38.488 --> 49:41.423
Field trip permission slips must
do so by the end Of the week.

49:41.491 --> 49:42.685
Hall of Science Permission
slips are due in the main office

49:43.493 --> 49:51.423
By friday afternoon. Thank you.

49:51.501 --> 49:54.436
Hi.

49:54.504 --> 49:56.699
How come you're not eating
with the teachers?

49:57.507 --> 50:00.442
Just...

50:00.510 --> 50:04.446
I felt like being alone.

50:04.514 --> 50:05.708
I know what you mean.

50:06.516 --> 50:09.451
You do?

50:09.519 --> 50:10.019
Mm-hmm.

50:17.527 --> 50:19.495
All right, Mr. Dunn, I'll see you later.

50:19.563 --> 50:22.726
Enjoy your lunch.

50:23.533 --> 50:26.468
Thank you.

50:26.536 --> 50:28.731
Oh, yeah, do you think
I could get a ride home later?

50:30.540 --> 50:31.040
Okay?

50:38.548 --> 50:42.484
Okay.

50:53.563 --> 50:55.758
All right.

50:56.566 --> 51:00.502
Thanks for the ride.

51:00.570 --> 51:01.764
Okay. Have a good weekend.

51:03.573 --> 51:04.073
Bye.

51:26.596 --> 51:27.096
Yo.

51:31.601 --> 51:32.795
I lost my key.

51:34.604 --> 51:36.538
What do we do?

51:36.606 --> 51:38.574
I don't know.

51:39.609 --> 51:40.803
She's an E.M.T.

51:41.611 --> 51:46.548
I could page her, but I don't know.

51:46.616 --> 51:48.811
All right, get in.

51:56.626 --> 52:04.556
What's up, y'all? You want some candy?

52:04.634 --> 52:05.566
That's all you got?

52:05.669 --> 52:08.832
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
So where your bike at?

52:09.639 --> 52:10.833
They stole it.

52:11.641 --> 52:12.835
They who?

52:13.643 --> 52:17.579
I don't know.
I'm going to find out though.

52:17.647 --> 52:19.842
So what, man. Y'all just chilling?

52:20.650 --> 52:25.849
She lost my key-her key.

52:26.656 --> 52:28.590
So what, Drey, what?

52:29.659 --> 52:31.593
No, man, we're cool.

52:31.661 --> 52:32.593
Are you cool, Drey?

52:32.662 --> 52:33.162
Mm-hmm.

52:37.667 --> 52:39.601
All right.

52:44.674 --> 52:45.874
What, you don't know him, huh?

52:46.676 --> 52:49.873
Who, Frank?

52:50.680 --> 52:52.875
Frank?

52:53.683 --> 52:55.617
I thought you said you didn't know him.

52:55.685 --> 52:57.006
Just a guy from the neighborhood.

52:57.687 --> 53:02.624
You know what he does?

53:02.692 --> 53:05.889
Look, I know that I'm the last person

53:06.696 --> 53:11.895
That should be saying this.

53:12.702 --> 53:19.904
You don't have to worry about me.

53:20.710 --> 53:28.710
Okay, let me-Just give me a sec.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.220
Wait.

53:40.730 --> 53:41.230
Okay.

53:52.742 --> 53:53.674
Have a seat.

53:53.743 --> 53:57.941
You can watch tv if you want.

53:58.748 --> 54:04.948
Make yourself at home.

54:05.755 --> 54:09.691
You got them old things?

54:09.759 --> 54:11.693
Records?

54:11.795 --> 54:12.955
Yeah.

54:13.763 --> 54:17.699
Yeah, little Miss mp3, I got records.

54:17.767 --> 54:25.767
You should check them out.
You might learn something.

54:33.783 --> 54:36.752
Who's this?

54:36.820 --> 54:37.980
My parents and my brother.

54:38.788 --> 54:40.722
Do they still live together?

54:40.790 --> 54:41.290
Yeah.

54:45.795 --> 54:48.730
Why you got so many books
about black people?

54:48.798 --> 54:50.993
I got books about all kinds of people.

54:51.801 --> 54:58.001
Can I borrow one?

54:58.808 --> 55:01.743
Yeah.

55:01.811 --> 55:06.748
Who's she?

55:06.816 --> 55:08.010
Just an old friend.

55:08.818 --> 55:11.753
What happened to her?

55:11.821 --> 55:14.756
Oh, well, you should mind your business.

55:14.824 --> 55:19.022
You put it up there.

55:19.829 --> 55:21.763
I've seen her before.

55:21.831 --> 55:27.030
She was at the game that night, right?

55:27.837 --> 55:28.337
Yeah.

55:34.844 --> 55:40.043
You need help in here?

55:40.850 --> 55:42.784
Do you like to cook?

55:42.852 --> 55:49.052
Yeah, sometimes, mostly just
for special occasions.

55:49.859 --> 55:52.054
You got a lady
coming over tonight or what?

55:52.862 --> 55:54.796
Yeah.

55:54.864 --> 55:56.058
You must like her a lot.

55:56.866 --> 55:58.060
Yeah, she's all right.

55:58.868 --> 56:00.802
She like you?

56:00.870 --> 56:03.065
I don't know.
I'm hard to like sometimes.

56:03.873 --> 56:04.805
That's true.

56:04.874 --> 56:05.374
Oh.

56:09.879 --> 56:11.639
Oh, yeah, you just got to,
you mash those up.

56:11.881 --> 56:12.813
You mash them up with your hands.

56:12.882 --> 56:15.077
Get in there and squeeze them.

56:15.885 --> 56:18.820
See, what you need is some
jokes. Women love jokes.

56:18.888 --> 56:22.085
Okay. You got any?

56:22.892 --> 56:24.493
What do you call cheese
that's not yours?

56:25.028 --> 56:29.829
Nacho cheese.

56:30.900 --> 56:33.095
Absolutely not.

56:33.903 --> 56:41.903
That's a funny joke. Thank you.

56:43.913 --> 56:44.845
Yeah.

56:44.914 --> 56:45.874
Can I ask you something?

56:45.915 --> 56:46.415
Mm-hmm.

56:55.925 --> 57:03.925
What's it like
when you smoke that stuff?

57:04.934 --> 57:06.868
Sorry.

57:06.970 --> 57:14.970
No, don't be. It's all right.

57:31.961 --> 57:36.159
Mash them up.

57:36.966 --> 57:43.895
Hope you have a nice date, Mr. Dunn.

57:43.973 --> 57:50.902
Hey, thanks for the joke.

57:50.980 --> 57:53.175
So my buddy gets in the car
and the cab driver's like,

57:53.983 --> 57:55.177
I'm so sorry I'm late, sir.

57:55.985 --> 57:58.920
I had to kill somebody
On the way here, you know.

57:58.988 --> 57:59.955
And he's like, what?

58:00.023 --> 58:03.186
He's like, oh, yeah
I kill him, I kill him.

58:03.993 --> 58:06.928
And he's like, what do you,
You, you killed him?

58:07.997 --> 58:10.192
I'm killing people, you know, anybody

58:11.000 --> 58:12.194
Who really kind of mouth off
to me, I fucking kill them, man.

58:13.002 --> 58:16.199
Turns out he thinks "kill" is
the word for "punch," right?

58:19.008 --> 58:21.943
My friend thinks that he's killing them.

58:22.011 --> 58:24.692
He's terrified and he thinks that
the word for "cement" is "semen."

58:25.014 --> 58:26.135
So he's like well, basically

58:27.016 --> 58:28.210
stepping on semen.

58:29.018 --> 58:31.213
There's semen everywhere.
There's semen buildings.

58:32.021 --> 58:35.218
It's lot of people, you know, so
everything is made of semen, you know.

58:36.025 --> 58:43.227
I didn't say every day.
You're her father.

58:44.033 --> 58:45.433
Today she got locked out the house.

01:00:35.144 --> 01:00:40.343
Are you a communist?

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.650
What?

01:00:47.156 --> 01:00:50.091
"Ohe in Africa"?

01:00:50.159 --> 01:00:52.093
So?

01:00:52.161 --> 01:01:00.161
"The Communist Manifesto?"

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:06.107
If I had a copy of "Mein Kampf"
Would that make me a Nazi?

01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:11.374
You know, this is really good,
very tasty.

01:01:12.181 --> 01:01:19.383
You should try it warm.

01:01:20.189 --> 01:01:21.178
Well, you don't have
a copy of of "Mein Kampf"

01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:25.386
But if you did, then yes,
I'd ask you if you were a Nazi.

01:01:26.195 --> 01:01:27.389
Maybe I'm hiding it.

01:01:28.197 --> 01:01:31.132
Why would you hide it?

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:39.200
'Cause it's just not cool
To be a Nazi anymore, baby.

01:01:48.217 --> 01:01:49.411
So what are you doing today?

01:01:50.219 --> 01:01:54.155
Oh, I got to-

01:01:54.257 --> 01:01:55.417
It's great you're writing.

01:01:56.225 --> 01:02:02.164
Yeah, we'll see.

01:02:02.231 --> 01:02:03.511
I should let you get to it then.

01:02:04.233 --> 01:02:05.794
Yeah, thanks though. I had a good time.

01:02:06.235 --> 01:02:07.119
Yeah, me too.

01:02:19.282 --> 01:02:22.445
On November 1, 1977,
Harvey Milk was elected

01:02:23.252 --> 01:02:25.186
To the San Francisco City Council.

01:02:25.254 --> 01:02:26.615
He was the first Openly gay person

01:02:27.256 --> 01:02:29.451
To ever be elected To public office.

01:02:30.259 --> 01:02:32.219
A year later he was
assassinated by another member

01:02:32.261 --> 01:02:34.456
Of the City Council Called Dan White.

01:02:35.264 --> 01:02:37.264
Reports that Harvey Milk
have been shot and killed.

01:02:37.266 --> 01:02:39.200
Dan White claimed he shot Milk
because he ate

01:02:39.268 --> 01:02:41.463
too much junk food that day.

01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:45.468
This would later be known
As the twinkie defense.

01:02:46.275 --> 01:02:48.209
Is that for real?

01:04:15.364 --> 01:04:18.561
Drey, Drey, come here.
Where are you going?

01:04:19.368 --> 01:04:20.562
Home.

01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:23.304
I'll give you a ride home.

01:04:23.372 --> 01:04:24.566
That's cool. I got a ride.

01:04:25.341 --> 01:04:26.308
I don't really think you should
be riding with him, do you think?

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:30.311
Drey, is everything cool?

01:04:30.379 --> 01:04:31.311
Everything's okay.
I'm going to take her home.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.312
Is that right?

01:04:32.381 --> 01:04:34.315
Yeah.

01:04:34.383 --> 01:04:36.317
Is that right, D, huh,
you getting a ride with teach?

01:04:36.385 --> 01:04:37.352
No, man.

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:40.583
Drey, Drey, Drey, come here.
Everything's fine.

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:43.324
Have a nice night.

01:04:43.392 --> 01:04:45.326
I'm going to take her home, Okay?

01:04:45.394 --> 01:04:46.588
Hey, look, man, you know what,
let me introduce myself, huh?

01:04:47.396 --> 01:04:49.591
I'm Frank.

01:04:50.399 --> 01:04:52.333
Come here now, okay?

01:04:52.435 --> 01:04:53.595
Come here. Come here.

01:04:58.407 --> 01:04:59.339
Come on.

01:04:59.408 --> 01:05:00.340
Did I hurt you?

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:04.607
We'll see you later, Teach. Come on.

01:05:20.429 --> 01:05:24.627
Dunn, right? Lloyd Dixon.

01:05:25.434 --> 01:05:27.629
My daughter Paula went
To Jefferson, Paula Dixon.

01:05:28.437 --> 01:05:30.632
You taught history, right?

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.635
Paula Dixon?

01:05:34.443 --> 01:05:37.378
She's in her first semester
At Georgetown, history major.

01:05:37.446 --> 01:05:38.262
Paula Dixon.

01:05:44.453 --> 01:05:49.652
You have a good night.

01:05:50.459 --> 01:05:50.959
Dave?

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.970
Dave?

01:06:25.461 --> 01:06:29.420
In asia the idea that things
are made of opposites,

01:06:29.498 --> 01:06:31.018
Ying and Yang, dates back 3,000 years.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.697
That was them saying change
is the only constant,

01:06:35.504 --> 01:06:37.438
But that just died in the west.

01:06:37.506 --> 01:06:40.441
It just couldn't be both,
couldn't be black and white.

01:06:40.509 --> 01:06:43.706
It would be right and wrong.
It had to be one or the other.

01:06:44.513 --> 01:06:46.447
Who am I to say
that aristotle is wrong, right,

01:06:46.515 --> 01:06:48.710
but that doesn't make any sense.

01:06:49.518 --> 01:06:50.712
These things need each other.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.719
The idea that all
God's creations are "perfect"-

01:06:57.526 --> 01:07:04.728
So just to suggest that a tree,
it's crooked and it's straight,

01:07:05.534 --> 01:07:07.729
It's strong and it's weak, is to suggest

01:07:08.537 --> 01:07:11.472
That god created something imperfect.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.735
They do however
acknowledge it in people.

01:07:14.543 --> 01:07:18.479
We are sinners, but we can
strive to be good,

01:07:18.547 --> 01:07:26.477
Just not in nature itself, I guess.

01:07:26.555 --> 01:07:29.752
Oh, I've got to go.

01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:38.559
You guys write down what's on the board.

01:07:40.569 --> 01:07:42.503
"Broward County Florida
Middle schools mistakenly

01:07:42.605 --> 01:07:45.768
"failed over 6500 students
In June due to what

01:07:46.575 --> 01:07:48.770
"later called a computer error.

01:07:49.578 --> 01:07:54.777
"A school official called the
total count of students affected.

01:07:55.584 --> 01:08:03.584
An insignificant sum."

01:08:07.596 --> 01:08:13.535
What goes, Danny boy? How's history?

01:08:13.602 --> 01:08:15.570
I can't do it anymore.

01:08:15.638 --> 01:08:18.538
Oh, I know the feeling.

01:08:18.607 --> 01:08:20.127
Hang in there. Things will get better.

01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:28.609
And if not, There's always summer.

01:08:30.618 --> 01:08:38.618
Don't you have class right now?

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:43.564
Look, look, look, that's him over there.

01:08:43.631 --> 01:08:45.566
That ain't even your bike, though.

01:08:45.634 --> 01:08:46.566
That's my bike.

01:08:47.636 --> 01:08:48.863
There he go right there.

01:08:49.638 --> 01:08:51.572
He a little round one too.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.572
This my bike, nigger.

01:08:54.643 --> 01:08:56.042
What the fuck you doing on my bike?

01:08:57.645 --> 01:08:58.578
You ain't know it was mines?

01:08:58.647 --> 01:08:59.578
What you mean
you ain't know it was mines?

01:08:59.648 --> 01:09:01.582
You always see me on this bike.

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:02.582
Sorry.

01:09:02.651 --> 01:09:06.587
I just didn't know it was your bike.

01:09:06.654 --> 01:09:09.852
You hella sorry, nigger.
I should fuck you up.

01:09:10.658 --> 01:09:16.859
Get off my bike.

01:09:19.667 --> 01:09:21.108
I thought you Was going fuck him up?

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:22.863
Didn't have to.

01:09:23.671 --> 01:09:26.607
Oh, shit, okay, you didn't have to.

01:09:56.739 --> 01:09:57.239
Hey.

01:10:10.719 --> 01:10:13.916
Hey.

01:10:14.723 --> 01:10:16.918
It's back.

01:10:17.726 --> 01:10:18.226
Yeah.

01:10:23.732 --> 01:10:24.926
Did you know my brother?

01:10:25.734 --> 01:10:30.694
I knew of him, but I didn't, you know.

01:10:30.773 --> 01:10:38.680
He wasn't in any of my classes
or anything.

01:10:38.747 --> 01:10:44.947
You think I could end up like him?

01:10:45.754 --> 01:10:46.254
Do you?

01:11:18.821 --> 01:11:21.984
He's got a 7-Up in his Mother fucking-.

01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:29.720
Hey, what's up, teach?
How's the Dianetics going?

01:11:29.798 --> 01:11:31.993
It's Dialectics. Can I talk to you?

01:11:32.801 --> 01:11:33.995
What's up?

01:11:34.803 --> 01:11:37.738
Okay, look, I hate to be this
guy right now, right?

01:11:37.806 --> 01:11:41.742
Mm-hmm.

01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:44.005
Excuse me?

01:11:44.813 --> 01:11:46.573
You heard me, okay,
so just do me this solid.

01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:47.747
All right, man, please?

01:11:47.816 --> 01:11:49.010
Do you a solid?

01:11:49.818 --> 01:11:52.013
You know what I'm saying.
You understand me.

01:11:53.822 --> 01:11:54.754
She's too precious kind of shit?

01:11:54.823 --> 01:11:55.755
I'm not kidding.

01:11:55.824 --> 01:11:56.756
Oh, I know.

01:11:56.859 --> 01:11:59.760
So you understand?

01:11:59.828 --> 01:12:02.023
Look, man, Drey is my family.
She's my friend, man.

01:12:02.831 --> 01:12:05.026
All these cats, these are my friends.

01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:07.435
And would you like to be my friend, man?

01:12:07.836 --> 01:12:08.768
What the fuck is this,
fucking romper room?

01:12:08.837 --> 01:12:11.772
What the fuck is a romper room?

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.120
Are you fucking listening to me?

01:12:13.842 --> 01:12:15.203
Why are you so fucking angry, man?

01:12:17.846 --> 01:12:19.207
Tell me what you're talking about.

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:24.045
Are you capable of that?

01:12:24.853 --> 01:12:28.050
So now we back to the point of
what is white is right, right?

01:12:28.857 --> 01:12:30.051
So-

01:12:30.859 --> 01:12:31.791
Fuck, this has nothing to do
with that and you know it.

01:12:31.894 --> 01:12:33.654
No, no, it's good for Drey
to have somebody.

01:12:33.862 --> 01:12:37.821
Like you looking out for her
Mr. Model A1 fucking citizen.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:45.900
I don't know, I don't know.

01:12:53.916 --> 01:12:57.079
Fuck.

01:12:57.886 --> 01:13:01.083
Because I'm supposed
to do something, right?

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:09.890
But what am I supposed to do?

01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:20.103
Look, man, you want a drink?

01:13:20.909 --> 01:13:22.877

You want some candy?

01:13:40.929 --> 01:13:43.124

That's Mike's little sister
Drey, that's her teach.

01:13:49.938 --> 01:13:52.133
What's happening?

01:13:52.941 --> 01:13:54.875
You ain't bringing
that shit in my house, man.

01:13:54.943 --> 01:14:00.882
Put that cat down.
Get your ass out here.

01:14:43.992 --> 01:14:51.992
Dunn, what's going on?

01:14:54.002 --> 01:15:02.002
I am not now nor have
I ever been a communist.

01:15:10.018 --> 01:15:13.954
What's happening?

01:15:14.022 --> 01:15:22.022
Just in the neighborhood,
thought maybe I'd surprise you.

01:15:25.033 --> 01:15:31.962
Yeah, it's a surprise. That's true.

01:15:32.074 --> 01:15:34.235
You okay?

01:15:35.043 --> 01:15:35.975
Yeah, I'm good.

01:15:36.044 --> 01:15:37.238
How about you? How are you?

01:15:38.046 --> 01:15:44.246
I'm good, a little tired, but I'm good.

01:15:45.053 --> 01:15:47.988
Oh, is it late?

01:15:48.056 --> 01:15:53.255
Well, you know, what time is it?
2:30, yeah.

01:15:54.062 --> 01:15:54.994
Oh.

01:15:55.063 --> 01:15:55.995
Yeah.

01:15:56.064 --> 01:15:57.584
Well, you know, we got class tomorrow.

01:15:58.066 --> 01:16:04.995
Oh, I forgot about class.
I'm sorry about last time.

01:16:05.073 --> 01:16:10.272
Okay. It's okay.

01:16:11.079 --> 01:16:18.281
Dunn, not right now, okay? No.

01:16:19.087 --> 01:16:21.282
Dunn-Okay, you're drunk.

01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:30.090
What are you doing? Stop it.

01:17:00.128 --> 01:17:04.064
Well, that was weird.

01:17:04.132 --> 01:17:09.069
What the fuck was that?

01:17:09.137 --> 01:17:15.076
I don't know.

01:17:15.143 --> 01:17:18.078
Listen, feel free To whatever, you know?

01:17:18.146 --> 01:17:19.340
Whatever. No hard feelings.

01:17:20.148 --> 01:17:28.148
I completely understand, okay?

01:17:30.158 --> 01:17:34.094
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:35.356
Or not, I don't know.

01:17:37.165 --> 01:17:45.165
I'm so fucked up right now.

01:17:46.174 --> 01:17:52.374
I hope you know I really liked you.

01:17:53.181 --> 01:17:58.118
I had fun.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.383
Not tonight I didn't have fun,
but other nights I had-

01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:10.190
We had fun, right?

01:18:14.202 --> 01:18:17.399
Look, I'm bleeding a bit so I'm
using your couch arm thing.

01:18:18.206 --> 01:18:26.206
I'm gonna wash it, okay?

01:18:29.217 --> 01:18:29.717
Sorry.

01:19:55.303 --> 01:19:56.497
What.

01:19:57.305 --> 01:19:59.239
How's things.

01:19:59.307 --> 01:20:05.507
Well, how's it look?

01:20:06.314 --> 01:20:09.249
What do you want?

01:20:09.317 --> 01:20:09.861
Nothing.

01:20:15.323 --> 01:20:18.258
Look, you know,
you don't really see other kids

01:20:18.326 --> 01:20:23.525
Coming up to my car, Drey,
to talk to me.

01:20:24.332 --> 01:20:28.530
It's, you know, I'm your teacher.

01:20:29.337 --> 01:20:32.534
I'm not your friend.

01:20:33.341 --> 01:20:35.536
Why don't you go play
with other kids your own age?

01:20:36.344 --> 01:20:40.280
I'm just trying to be alone.

01:20:40.348 --> 01:20:47.277
Then be alone then, asshole.

01:20:47.355 --> 01:20:47.855
Bitch.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:40.400
Hey, I think Henderson
was looking for you.

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:46.369
Must be about the new curriculum, huh?

01:21:46.448 --> 01:21:53.354
Yeah, no, I'm sure that's it,
but, hey, Dan,

01:21:53.455 --> 01:21:55.355
If there's anything else
going on, you know,

01:21:55.423 --> 01:22:02.625
If you need any help,
you know, anything,

01:22:03.431 --> 01:22:11.431
You know we're here for you, pal.

01:22:17.445 --> 01:22:18.397
Lose the door.

01:22:31.459 --> 01:22:39.459
Is there something going on
that I should know about?

01:22:45.473 --> 01:22:49.432
On September 11, 1973,
The CIA helped overthrow

01:22:49.511 --> 01:22:53.413
and murder democratically
Elected Chilean president Salvador Allende.

01:22:53.481 --> 01:22:55.241
The military coup led
To mass disappearances,

01:22:55.483 --> 01:22:57.678
assassinations and tortures Of thousands

01:22:58.486 --> 01:23:00.420
Of Chilean civilians
under the leadership

01:23:00.488 --> 01:23:03.423
Of U.S. backed dictator
Augusto Pinochet.

01:23:03.491 --> 01:23:05.686
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger

01:23:06.494 --> 01:23:09.691
Said of Allende's 1970
Election, "these issues are much"

01:23:10.498 --> 01:23:18.498
Too important for the Chilean
voters to decide for themselves."

01:23:20.508 --> 01:23:21.440
Danny?

01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:24.705
What happened to your lip?

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.360
That's plenty, thanks.

01:23:26.514 --> 01:23:29.448
That's good.

01:23:31.519 --> 01:23:32.713
You're writing a novel?

01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:35.241
It's a kids book
that I haven't started yet.

01:23:35.523 --> 01:23:37.457
I love children's books.
What's it about?

01:23:37.525 --> 01:23:38.719
Dialectics.

01:23:39.527 --> 01:23:42.724
Dialectics. What is that?

01:23:43.531 --> 01:23:49.731
It's a theory that attempts
to explain how change works.

01:23:51.539 --> 01:23:54.474
How does change work, Dan?

01:23:54.542 --> 01:23:56.476
Let's save it for dessert, Dad.

01:23:57.545 --> 01:23:58.739
Yeah, it was really great.

01:23:59.547 --> 01:24:01.027
There were like 400,000 people there.

01:24:01.549 --> 01:24:03.517
Oh, that's fantastic.

01:24:03.585 --> 01:24:05.386
What did they report it
in the press, 200,000?

01:24:05.553 --> 01:24:07.487
Danny Glover was there.

01:24:07.555 --> 01:24:08.487
Danny Glover, oh, I like him.

01:24:08.556 --> 01:24:10.490
Mm-hmm.

01:24:11.559 --> 01:24:12.491
What was that-

01:24:13.561 --> 01:24:14.755
Hey, what was his name?

01:24:15.563 --> 01:24:16.757
Charles.

01:24:17.565 --> 01:24:18.532
Charles, get your fat ass off my bike,

01:24:18.633 --> 01:24:20.498
That's what she said,
before I fuck your fat ass up.

01:24:20.568 --> 01:24:22.502
You said that?

01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:24.765
You know she did,
then my man started stressing.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.901
He start apologizing. "I'm sorry."

01:24:27.575 --> 01:24:29.136
I didn't know it was yours. I'm sorry."

01:24:30.578 --> 01:24:32.512
Tell her.

01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:33.512
Didn't have to.

01:24:33.581 --> 01:24:35.776
Ah, didn't have to.

01:24:36.584 --> 01:24:38.785
That's my girl right there,
poking people on the street.

01:24:44.592 --> 01:24:46.526
Oh, Danny, you won't believe
what I found this week.

01:24:46.594 --> 01:24:49.529
You guys really live it up around here.

01:24:49.597 --> 01:24:53.795
You hear that, the rock star
approved, Cindy Lou Who.

01:24:54.602 --> 01:24:55.963
Come on, Jeff, didn't you tell her

01:24:56.604 --> 01:24:59.801
Around here we always party
like it's 1999.

01:25:00.608 --> 01:25:02.803
Oh, my god, can you be
any more embarrassing.

01:25:04.612 --> 01:25:07.547
No. Check out this scar?

01:25:07.615 --> 01:25:09.549
Remember?

01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:11.812
Remember this one?

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.120
Jesus.

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:54.855
Why you got these scary things?

01:25:55.663 --> 01:25:59.599
Got them off the internet,
Some dude in Texas.

01:25:59.701 --> 01:26:01.862
I wouldn't want these things
in my house.

01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:06.606
Well, they in my house
and my house is your house.

01:26:06.674 --> 01:26:14.674
So deal with it.

01:26:20.688 --> 01:26:23.623
You ever sell to Coach?

01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:24.885
Why?

01:26:25.693 --> 01:26:28.890
Just wondering.

01:26:29.697 --> 01:26:30.629
Look, don't you think
you and Teach's relationship

01:26:30.698 --> 01:26:31.630
Is a little-

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:35.635
Inappropriate?

01:26:36.704 --> 01:26:39.639
He your teacher, Drey.

01:26:39.841 --> 01:26:41.900
He's my friend.

01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:47.909
Look, he's a basehead, all right,
and baseheads don't have friends.

01:26:48.716 --> 01:26:53.653
I mean, this motherfucker
was outside my house yesterday

01:26:53.721 --> 01:26:56.656
Telling me that we shouldn't
be associated with each other.

01:27:31.759 --> 01:27:34.694
I'm gonna take a freight train,

01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:36.957
Down at the station, Lord

01:27:37.765 --> 01:27:42.964
I don't care where it goes

01:27:43.771 --> 01:27:49.710
Gonna climb me a mountain,
the highest mountain, Lord

01:27:49.777 --> 01:27:51.972
Gonna jump off, nobody gonna know

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:56.716
Hey, teach me something, Dan.

01:27:56.784 --> 01:28:02.984
Teach me some ebonics.

01:28:03.791 --> 01:28:08.990
Is that what they got
you teaching in that zoo?

01:28:09.797 --> 01:28:10.729
Hey, tell me something.

01:28:10.798 --> 01:28:18.798
How do you say asshole In ebonics?

01:28:22.810 --> 01:28:30.740
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry I'm an asshole.

01:28:30.818 --> 01:28:35.755
I love you. You know that, right?

01:28:35.857 --> 01:28:40.021
Yeah, I know.

01:28:40.828 --> 01:28:44.764
All right. Good, good.

01:28:44.832 --> 01:28:52.832
241, apartment three.

01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:05.842
Hello? What's up?

01:29:06.854 --> 01:29:11.791
I bet you are so good
with those kids, Daniel Dunn.

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.794
Thanks, Mom.

01:29:14.862 --> 01:29:19.799
Sometimes I think we're the
only thing keeping them sane.

01:29:19.867 --> 01:29:20.799
It's a good thing, you know, to teach.

01:29:20.868 --> 01:29:23.803
Your father and I thought we were going

01:29:23.871 --> 01:29:24.803
To change the world
when we were young, you know.

01:29:24.872 --> 01:29:26.066
What did we know?

01:29:26.874 --> 01:29:28.068
Well, you stopped a war so-

01:29:28.876 --> 01:29:30.070
You think so?

01:29:30.878 --> 01:29:31.810
Yeah.

01:29:31.879 --> 01:29:35.076
That's nice, honey.

01:29:36.884 --> 01:29:39.819
Than anything we did, you know?

01:29:39.887 --> 01:29:44.085
One man alone means nothing.

01:29:44.892 --> 01:29:48.828
I guess not.
Do you hear from Rachel anymore?

01:29:48.896 --> 01:29:50.090
Not really.

01:29:50.898 --> 01:29:52.832
I saw her at the pharmacy the other day,

01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:56.836
Maybe it's her Mom.

01:29:56.904 --> 01:29:58.838
You know, she looked great.

01:29:58.906 --> 01:30:03.843
You should give her a call, but,
you know, clean up a little first.

01:30:03.911 --> 01:30:06.106
You're killing me with the tie, okay.

01:30:06.914 --> 01:30:11.851
Stop, I'm fine.

01:30:11.953 --> 01:30:14.114
You happy?

01:30:14.922 --> 01:30:17.117
I'm so happy.

01:30:17.925 --> 01:30:20.860
That's so great, sweetie.
You're happy, I'm happy.

01:30:20.928 --> 01:30:28.858
Watch the basketballs, Okay, honey?

01:30:28.936 --> 01:30:29.548
Hey, Mom.

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:56.157
How was it? Easy, right?

01:30:56.964 --> 01:30:59.899
I saw you shaking all across
the street and shit.

01:30:59.967 --> 01:31:01.808
It sure beats the hell
out of flipping burgers.

01:31:01.969 --> 01:31:02.649
Thank you.

01:31:24.992 --> 01:31:30.931
Your Mom said there's
more wine out here.

01:31:31.032 --> 01:31:34.195
I found it.

01:31:35.002 --> 01:31:37.197
Do you like my brother?

01:31:38.005 --> 01:31:40.200
Yeah.

01:31:41.008 --> 01:31:44.205
Why?

01:31:45.012 --> 01:31:51.941
He's nice. He's funny.

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:55.215
Sometimes.

01:31:56.023 --> 01:31:57.957
Like what?

01:31:58.025 --> 01:32:04.954
Like knock, knock.

01:32:05.032 --> 01:32:06.226
Who's there?

01:32:07.034 --> 01:32:10.231
The interrupting cow.

01:32:11.038 --> 01:32:18.240
The interrupting-Moo.

01:32:19.046 --> 01:32:19.546
Yeah?

01:33:12.099 --> 01:33:17.036
Where you going? Come inside, sweetie.

01:33:17.104 --> 01:33:25.034
Ain't nobody going to bite you.

01:35:04.211 --> 01:35:12.211
Everything cool?

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:20.422
I guess we should get you home then.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.215
I don't think It's a good idea

01:36:16.283 --> 01:36:20.219
You falling asleep in front
of the tv every night.

01:36:20.287 --> 01:36:22.482
What's up, Drey? You in a funk today?

01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:28.227
Want to tell me why?

01:36:28.295 --> 01:36:31.230
Just thinking about Mike, I guess.

01:36:31.298 --> 01:36:33.493
I miss your brother, too.

01:36:34.301 --> 01:36:40.240
We'll go see him as soon
As I get some time off.

01:36:40.341 --> 01:36:42.582
I can't believe they hit me
with another double tomorrow.

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:51.240
Can you believe that?
I can't get a goddamn break.

01:36:51.318 --> 01:36:55.254
So what else is happening?

01:36:55.322 --> 01:36:56.254
I heard something about
a civil rights thing

01:36:56.357 --> 01:37:00.521
With Oprah or something.

01:37:01.328 --> 01:37:01.828
Drey?

01:37:15.342 --> 01:37:17.276
Hi, honey, just calling to let you know

01:37:17.344 --> 01:37:20.279
How much fun it was for us last night,

01:37:20.347 --> 01:37:22.542
and we should do it more often.

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:31.350
I love you, sweetie. Call us soon, okay?

01:37:54.381 --> 01:37:55.621
Hello, everyone. I'm Mr. Light.

01:37:58.385 --> 01:37:59.579
I really don't know.

01:38:00.387 --> 01:38:03.322
When's he coming back?

01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:04.584
They're not really telling me
Too much in the office.

01:38:05.392 --> 01:38:13.392
Why don't you guys tell me
What you've been learning?

01:38:26.413 --> 01:38:27.345
I don't know.

01:38:27.414 --> 01:38:29.348
What's good with you?

01:38:29.416 --> 01:38:30.610
Chilling. Need a ride?

01:38:31.418 --> 01:38:32.612
No, I got my bike.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.352
Well, throw it in the back.

01:38:34.421 --> 01:38:36.355
I got to get home.

01:38:36.423 --> 01:38:37.617
Well, I'll take you.

01:38:39.426 --> 01:38:43.362
Drey?

01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:51.430
Look, I'll see you around, huh?

01:39:36.483 --> 01:39:38.417
What happened to your friends?

01:39:38.485 --> 01:39:39.369
They're gone.

01:39:47.494 --> 01:39:49.689
You missed a hell of a party.

01:39:50.497 --> 01:39:51.449
Looks like it.

01:40:15.522 --> 01:40:16.202
Thank you.

01:40:28.535 --> 01:40:29.035
Ouch.

01:40:39.546 --> 01:40:44.882
You ready to go?

01:41:09.576 --> 01:41:17.576
You missed a spot.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.795
Knock knock.

01:41:36.603 --> 01:41:37.797
Who's there?

01:41:38.605 --> 01:41:40.539
The interrupting cow.

01:41:40.641 --> 01:41:47.547
The interrupting cow who?

01:41:47.614 --> 01:41:48.114
Moo.

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:54.814
That was horrible.

01:41:55.622 --> 01:41:56.122
Yeah.

01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:31.650
