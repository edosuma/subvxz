Do you ever think about
what people do in your house?

00:46.296 --> 00:49.090
Well, you know Joel
made a list of rules, so...

00:49.090 --> 00:50.425
- So?
- Tiffani: Exactly.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.010
No one pays attention
to rules in a rental.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.473
Yeah, seriously.

I don't think anybody
would, like...

00:59.142 --> 01:00.894

- What? Like...

01:00.894 --> 01:04.230
- fuck in your bed?
- They're definitely
banging in your bed.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.441
- And your couch.
- And on your kitchen counter

01:06.441 --> 01:08.485

those peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.952
Is this where the party's at?

01:17.952 --> 01:20.079
- Hi!
- Tiffani/Joel: Hi.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.791
It's so exciting to
finally meet the gang.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.293
- Can I get some hugs?
Well, first...
- Me first.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.504
- I gotta hug Fred.
- Hey, babe.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.089

- Hi. Oh, my God!

01:36.429 --> 01:39.182

- Mm-hmm. Yes.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.225

01:40.225 --> 01:41.601
Just had a long drive.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.520
I'm gonna go freshen up
and then you can deal me in.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.104
Fred:
Babe, you want me
to come up there with ya

01:45.104 --> 01:46.606
- and help you get settled?
- No, no, no, babe.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.649
- You stay here.
- You sure?

01:47.649 --> 01:49.317

- Okay.

Uh, I don't believe so!

fill us in?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.176

take your turn.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.054
- Oh... Okay.
- W--

02:18.054 --> 02:20.932
We're just gonna play cards

02:20.932 --> 02:22.725

- (laughs) What?

02:36.030 --> 02:38.616
This woman right here?
She's like a mustang.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.702
- (giggling)
- I never thought I'd catch her.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.204
The timing just
never worked out.

02:43.204 --> 02:46.249
I was dating someone,
then Fred wasn't available...

02:46.249 --> 02:47.959
I thought all these
trips you were taking

02:47.959 --> 02:50.670
- were to visit your mom.
- Fred: Well, you know, sort of,

02:50.670 --> 02:53.923
but I needed a little help
with my, uh, arithmetic.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.508
(all laughing)

02:55.508 --> 02:57.594
- So, when did you guys meet?
- Susan: Oh,

02:57.594 --> 02:58.761
when was grad school, hon?

02:58.761 --> 03:00.346
- Um, what?
- Sam: Wait.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.265
You-- you went to
grad school together?

03:02.265 --> 03:03.808
Fred:
Yeah, we were friends
at grad school,

03:03.808 --> 03:05.977
and then, uh,
a little bit more.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.104
But then, she got
engaged to some guy,

03:08.104 --> 03:10.732
and then, she got
engaged to another guy.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.358
Oh, that was a mistake.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.735
- He was a pig.
- Copy that.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.986
- (laughs)
- Fred: But then, I, you know,

03:14.986 --> 03:17.739
I slid in there,
and let her cry on my shoulder.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.283
- Yeah, you did!
- Fred: Tiffani!

03:20.283 --> 03:22.911
- (laughter)
- Susan: Is that how it happened?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.579
It's always been Fred for me.

03:24.579 --> 03:28.166
He didn't want me to hide,
so I had to come out to my dad.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.586
I said to him, "I'm dating
someone who is important to me.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.297
He's trans,
and I want you to know."

03:34.297 --> 03:37.050
- That's really beautiful.
- So sweet.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.384
Come on, I'm turning 50!

03:38.384 --> 03:40.386
I'm not gonna play
the field anymore.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.971
Plus, I have this
situation right here.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.264

- Susie, you know,

03:43.264 --> 03:45.808
she helps me tie my shoes
every single morning.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.977
- (laughter)
- That's love.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.063
- Okay, how about
some shots, people?
- Yes!

03:50.063 --> 03:51.272
Tiffani:
Yes, please.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.608
All:
Shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots!

03:53.608 --> 03:56.444
- Joel: Holy shit.
- Sam: Holy shit is right.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.572

was keeping that from us.

he's getting married.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.751
Just a little boring, but...

for 25 years...

04:20.677 --> 04:23.429
Yeah, but dating other people,
blah, blah, blah.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.683
And now,
he's just gettin' married?
What the fuck?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.559

They seem really happy.

Of course,
