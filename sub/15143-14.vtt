00:31.208 --> 00:33.291

so tonight's the night.

00:37.458 --> 00:38.667
We got to tell Mom and Dad

00:38.709 --> 00:40.000
we don't want to do

00:38.709 --> 00:40.000
game night anymore.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.750
Yeah.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.375
We're allowed to have lives too.

00:44.417 --> 00:46.417
It's time to take a stand.

00:46.458 --> 00:48.667
No more family game night.

00:48.709 --> 00:51.333
- Who's ready for

00:48.709 --> 00:51.333
family game night?

00:51.375 --> 00:54.333
- Best night of the week!

00:54.375 --> 00:55.500
- Woot!

00:57.458 --> 00:58.917
Why aren't you wooting?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.709
Mom, Dad...

01:00.750 --> 01:02.250
Before we woot,

01:02.291 --> 01:05.583
we want to talk to you

01:02.291 --> 01:05.583
about game night.

01:05.625 --> 01:09.125
I'm getting the sense you're not

01:05.625 --> 01:09.125
super excited about game night.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.750
Yeah, do you guys not want

01:09.166 --> 01:11.750
to do game night anymore?

01:11.792 --> 01:13.834
[all]

01:11.792 --> 01:13.834
[gently] No!

01:13.875 --> 01:15.875
- Great.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.875
I'll get the pencils.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.875
- I'll get the snacks.

01:19.959 --> 01:22.875
Maybe tonight's not the night.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.834
Right.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.834
Plan B.

01:24.875 --> 01:28.417
We lose every game and get

01:24.875 --> 01:28.417

01:31.041 --> 01:32.250

No, no, no, no, no!

02:44.166 --> 02:45.625
There's more.

02:45.667 --> 02:46.959
Tonight's the perfect night

02:53.333 --> 02:55.750
Which second cousin

02:53.333 --> 02:55.750
moved to Wisconsin

02:55.792 --> 02:58.792
solely for his love of cheese?

02:58.834 --> 02:59.959
Think about that

03:00.000 --> 03:01.125
while we get the game.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.542
I wish Mom and Dad had something
