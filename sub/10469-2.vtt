00:01.532 --> 00:03.012
'Previously on Broadchurch...'

00:04.000 --> 00:07.500
Danny?
Give me a call, sweetheart.
I want to know where you are.

00:08.063 --> 00:10.081
The body of an 11-year-old child

00:10.114 --> 00:13.432
was found on Harbour Cliff beach
at Broadchurch.

00:13.433 --> 00:15.592
Alec Hardy.
I know. You got my job.

00:15.593 --> 00:18.594
He was strangled. We are treating
Danny's death as suspicious.

00:19.844 --> 00:22.362
Until we're ready,
this remains confidential.

00:22.363 --> 00:25.042
- Broadchurch Echo.
- I can't talk to you.

00:25.043 --> 00:28.162
Why have you released
his name? It's on Twitter.

00:28.163 --> 00:31.882
Who told the journalist?
They made it look like an accident.

00:31.883 --> 00:34.402
What are they asking?
Where were you last night?

00:34.403 --> 00:36.162
I told you, I was on a job.

00:36.163 --> 00:38.522
Is there anything
you want to tell me now?

00:38.523 --> 00:41.484
If you or someone you know
has any information

00:41.485 --> 00:43.204
please come forward now.

00:46.724 --> 00:49.124
We will catch whoever did this.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.783 --> 01:53.743
How are you doing, lovely?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.102
OK.

01:56.103 --> 01:58.222
You had nightmares.

01:58.223 --> 02:01.223
Did I?
You were shouting in your sleep.

02:02.983 --> 02:04.782
What was I saying?

02:04.783 --> 02:07.343
Couldn't make it out.
You said "Danny" at one point.

02:08.703 --> 02:10.782
Will I have to talk to the police?

02:11.903 --> 02:14.863
Yeah, at some point.
But not today, I don't think.

02:16.063 --> 02:18.983
Unless you can think of anything
that might help us.

02:18.984 --> 02:21.022
No.

02:21.023 --> 02:23.023
When I have to talk to them...

02:24.943 --> 02:26.903
can it be with you?

02:28.103 --> 02:30.103
I don't think so.

02:35.303 --> 02:38.702
"I hope you and your family
find some peace."

02:38.703 --> 02:41.103
What do you write
that doesn't sound glib?

02:41.104 --> 02:43.063
They'll appreciate it.

02:44.903 --> 02:48.141
Heard anything on when that tent
will be off the beach?

02:48.142 --> 02:50.701
When they're done, I suppose.
No time soon.

02:50.702 --> 02:53.861
I just hope they find the killer,
and chop his balls off.

02:53.862 --> 02:55.541
Come and have a drink later.

02:55.542 --> 02:58.503
Hey, how you going?
Good. Loving the room, thanks.

03:03.223 --> 03:05.062
Olly? Yup.
Hi.

03:05.063 --> 03:08.262
Oh! Karen.
Nice place.

03:08.263 --> 03:11.461
Yeah, well, you know,
when the fuses haven't blown.

03:11.462 --> 03:13.901
So, I don't suppose
you've got a spare desk

03:13.902 --> 03:17.341
or just a corner of the office
I can squirrel myself away in?

03:17.342 --> 03:20.181
We are part of the same newspaper
group, after all. Of course.

03:20.182 --> 03:21.941
Maggie Radcliffe. I'm the editor.

03:21.942 --> 03:24.781
Karen White, Daily Herald.
You're here fast.

03:24.782 --> 03:27.341
I remember your stuff
on the Yorkshire Ripper.

03:27.342 --> 03:29.943
Long time ago now.
Is there a spare desk?

03:29.944 --> 03:32.343
I'll be no bother, just...
No.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.063
Well,
we're a very busy operation here.

03:38.383 --> 03:40.782
Yeah.
And if I give you a desk,

03:40.783 --> 03:43.223
what happens
if others start showing up?

03:44.823 --> 03:47.823
Not to worry. Thanks anyway.
I'll see you soon.

05:20.263 --> 05:23.142
DI Hardy? Karen White, Daily Herald.

05:23.143 --> 05:25.621
I know. You came to the briefing
last night.

05:25.622 --> 05:28.183
I just wondered if I could buy you
a cup of tea.

05:28.184 --> 05:30.342
You're astonishing.

05:30.343 --> 05:32.783
Well, if you need me
I'm staying at the Trader's.

05:34.783 --> 05:38.941
Give me the details, CID will call
you back when someone's available.

05:38.942 --> 05:42.181
Sir, for you. You need to get
yourself organised up there.

05:42.182 --> 05:44.341
It's Saturday and the phone lines
can't cope.

05:44.342 --> 05:45.943
Hello. Broadchurch Police.

05:48.143 --> 05:51.103
Morning. We got you a coffee.
I don't drink coffee.

05:51.104 --> 05:52.743
Course you don't.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.861
Frank said
you were out at the cliffs.

05:55.862 --> 05:58.741
I walked Danny's paper round.
There's a hut on Briar Cliff,

05:58.742 --> 06:01.781
mile and a half along the coast
from where Danny's body was found.

06:01.782 --> 06:03.981
Find out who owns it
and the car park below.

06:03.982 --> 06:06.061
Collect the CCTV
from the camera there.

06:06.062 --> 06:08.061
How're we doing
on the house to house?

06:08.062 --> 06:10.701
We've got five uniform allocated,
two probationers,

06:10.702 --> 06:13.821
one who can't drive, and one who'd
never taken a statement before.

06:13.822 --> 06:16.461
That's all they've given us?
It's a summer weekend.

06:16.462 --> 06:20.061
You've got three music festivals and
two sporting events within 100 miles,

06:20.062 --> 06:22.741
so all the officers
are attached to them until Monday.

06:22.742 --> 06:24.221
Don't tell the family.

06:24.222 --> 06:26.781
Uniform are moaning
they're having to take calls.

06:26.782 --> 06:28.861
We're getting more phone lines
put in.

06:28.862 --> 06:31.543
Clear desk policy end of the day,
yeah?

06:33.223 --> 06:36.701
SOCO are at work on the beach,
it's gonna be a long one.

06:36.702 --> 06:39.423
Oh, we're still going through
the Latimer house.

06:40.503 --> 06:41.981
Sorry, are you listening?

06:41.982 --> 06:44.301
Danny's skateboard. Danny's mobile.
Priority.

06:44.302 --> 06:47.303
Also, main suspects. You know
this town, who's the most likely?

06:48.223 --> 06:50.823
If the boy was killed
before he was left on the beach,

06:50.824 --> 06:52.822
where's the murder scene?

06:52.823 --> 06:54.423
What are you doing now?

06:55.703 --> 06:58.141
We've managed to find
a Family Liaison Officer,

06:58.142 --> 07:01.181
I'm gonna take him over to the
Latimers. Oh, and Jack Marshall,

07:01.182 --> 07:05.023
owns the paper shop, rang in,
he said he'd remembered something.

07:06.663 --> 07:08.303
You're welcome.

07:14.063 --> 07:18.063
Couldn't stop thinking about him...
all last night.

07:19.143 --> 07:21.423
I help run the Sea Brigade.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.623
Danny'd been coming about 18 months,
on and off.

07:25.624 --> 07:28.463
Cheeky lad, but a good heart.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.143
It matters, a good heart.

07:35.623 --> 07:39.422
You said you remembered something
about seeing Danny.

07:39.423 --> 07:43.462
Must have been end of last month.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.861
Around quarter to eight
on a Wednesday morning,

07:45.862 --> 07:49.303
on the road leading up to the
clifftops on the way to Linton Hill.

07:49.304 --> 07:52.262
I saw him.
What was he doing?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.942
Talking to the postman.

07:53.943 --> 07:55.943
Well,...

07:57.303 --> 08:00.342
not talking. More like... arguing.

08:00.343 --> 08:02.542
He was quite a way away,

08:02.543 --> 08:05.223
but the body language
was pretty clear.

08:05.224 --> 08:07.422
Then Danny stormed off.

08:07.423 --> 08:09.782
The postman was calling after him.

08:09.783 --> 08:12.222
You're certain it was the postman?

08:12.223 --> 08:15.661
Well he had a bag, and one of those
high-visibility jackets.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.341
Who else is going to be out
that time in the morning?

08:18.342 --> 08:20.063
Can you describe him for me?

08:20.064 --> 08:21.982
He was a long way off.

08:21.983 --> 08:25.383
Medium height, short brown hair,
I think.

08:26.583 --> 08:29.543
It was only after you were
in yesterday that I remembered.

08:30.783 --> 08:32.783
I should've mentioned.

08:46.863 --> 08:49.142
Erm, they're elimination prints,

08:49.143 --> 08:52.543
to rule out your prints from anything
we might find here or anywhere else.

08:52.544 --> 08:54.062
Is this necessary?

08:54.063 --> 08:57.623
If she wants us to do it,
it's necessary, isn't it?

08:59.783 --> 09:01.743
Did anyone sleep?

09:03.983 --> 09:07.982
No. So, erm, Pete will be
your Family Liaison Officer.

09:07.983 --> 09:11.261
It's his job to keep you up to date
with the investigation,

09:11.262 --> 09:14.583
answer your questions, or talk about
any questions we might have.

09:14.584 --> 09:18.502
Why can't you do that? No offence.
None taken.

09:18.503 --> 09:22.781
It's a very specialised job.
Pete's just completed his training.

09:22.782 --> 09:24.143
Yeah, you're my first!

09:28.463 --> 09:29.902
But you know us.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.021
The best thing I can do is to find
who killed Danny and I will.

09:33.022 --> 09:35.543
When do we start arranging
the funeral?

09:35.544 --> 09:38.063
That has to wait, I'm afraid.

09:39.503 --> 09:42.661
Until we have the person responsible
in custody, Danny's...

09:42.662 --> 09:46.301
His body is... Oh, god, I'm sorry
to talk about it like this -

09:46.302 --> 09:48.741
it's the most valuable piece
of evidence we have.

09:48.742 --> 09:51.141
We can't allow him to be buried
until we're sure

09:51.142 --> 09:54.303
we've got the right person
and enough evidence to convict them.

09:56.463 --> 10:00.462
So we can't have him back?
Not yet. I'm sorry.

10:00.463 --> 10:03.463
He's not evidence, he's my brother.
I understand, I really do.

10:03.464 --> 10:05.663
Give her the piece of paper.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.263
We made a list.
People who might have done it.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.543
Oh, right.

10:17.663 --> 10:19.263
These are all your friends.

10:24.623 --> 10:25.983
We know.

10:28.423 --> 10:30.063
DS Miller.

10:32.823 --> 10:34.663
Excuse me.

10:39.143 --> 10:43.463
Ã£500 in cash, taped to the underside
of the bed frame in Danny's room.

10:43.487 --> 10:44.645
You're kidding.

10:44.646 --> 10:46.525
And we found this.

10:46.526 --> 10:49.766
Cocaine. In the daughter's room.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.246
Bloody hell.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.438
So, tell me about Broadchurch.

11:08.490 --> 11:11.369
OK. It's the only town
for about 20 miles.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.479
There's one road in, one road out.
Market twice weekly...

11:14.480 --> 11:17.278
Yeah, I've got all that.
Who lives here?

11:17.279 --> 11:20.457
Well, a lot have been here
all their lives, generations.

11:20.483 --> 11:23.362
Some of them haven't even been
50 miles outside of town.

11:23.363 --> 11:25.042
And then there's the incomers.

11:25.043 --> 11:27.522
Young families, left cities
when they had babies,

11:27.523 --> 11:29.762
came here for the schools
and the sea.

11:29.763 --> 11:33.762
We get tourists in the summer,
but we're a working town mainly.

11:33.763 --> 11:36.482
Much crime?
It's mostly theft from lock-ups,

11:36.483 --> 11:39.442
odd bit of drug use, drink driving.
Seriously.

11:39.443 --> 11:42.642
I do the weekly crime report in
the paper with one of the uniforms.

11:42.643 --> 11:45.762
About 30 offences a week,
but mostly all are minor.

11:45.763 --> 11:47.202
We've never had a murder.

11:47.203 --> 11:49.884
And that's the sort of story
you do at the Echo. Yeah.

11:49.885 --> 11:52.643
Clubs, schools, council meetings.

11:52.644 --> 11:55.044
Maggie says
we celebrate the everyday.

11:56.524 --> 11:58.123
And what about you?

11:58.124 --> 12:00.203
What do you want?

12:00.204 --> 12:03.322
I want to work on a national.
I want to be you, basically.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.404
Well, be careful what you wish for.

12:05.405 --> 12:07.844
How come you were here so quick?

12:09.564 --> 12:11.402
Look, if I'm gonna report on this,

12:11.403 --> 12:13.844
I need to understand the town,
the people.

12:15.164 --> 12:18.363
You help me,
and I might be able to help you.

12:18.364 --> 12:20.124
What do you think?

12:33.164 --> 12:35.922
Have you told my Mum and Dad
about the wrap?

12:35.923 --> 12:38.122
Not yet.
Please don't. It's not mine.

12:38.123 --> 12:41.404
It was in your room.
I don't use it, I swear I don't.

12:42.564 --> 12:44.124
Do you deal it?
No!

12:45.244 --> 12:49.922
This isn't anything
to do with Danny, I promise.
It was a mistake. A big mistake.

12:49.923 --> 12:53.004
If you don't use it or deal it,
did someone leave you holding it?

12:55.884 --> 12:59.082
And you're protecting that person.
It's one tiny wrap.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.642
Oh, we'll tell your Mum that.
No, you said you wouldn't.

13:01.643 --> 13:04.562
Chloe, possession of a class A drug
is a criminal offence.

13:04.563 --> 13:06.722
Dealing a class A drug
is a criminal offence.

13:06.723 --> 13:09.044
I was just passing it on.
That is dealing!

13:10.564 --> 13:13.162
You won't get in trouble
if you tell me the truth.

13:13.163 --> 13:14.644
Who gave you the cocaine?

13:18.604 --> 13:20.123
Becca Fisher.

13:20.124 --> 13:23.923
At the hotel?
I work for her some weekends.

13:23.924 --> 13:26.202
And where did the money come from?
What money?

13:26.203 --> 13:27.802
Oh, Chloe, don't get smart.

13:27.803 --> 13:30.444
I don't know anything about
any money, I swear.

13:32.484 --> 13:35.122
Why is Becca Fisher giving
a 15-year-old girl cocaine?

13:35.123 --> 13:37.124
Oh, God,
I'm gonna get in such trouble.

13:47.164 --> 13:50.404
Chloe Latimer says you
supplied her with a wrap of cocaine.

13:50.405 --> 13:51.963
What? You're kidding!

13:51.964 --> 13:53.804
Why would she say that
if it's not true?

13:57.684 --> 14:01.843
There was this couple,
down from London for a long weekend,

14:01.844 --> 14:03.522
in a suite, spending money,

14:03.523 --> 14:05.444
they asked me if I could get them
some coke.

14:08.484 --> 14:10.522
Chloe was working for me
that weekend,

14:10.523 --> 14:13.002
I asked her if she knew
where I might find some.

14:13.003 --> 14:16.162
She took so bloody long, the couple
had gone - I gave it back to her.

14:16.163 --> 14:17.964
Not now - thanks, Emily.
Sorry.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.403
Where did Chloe get it from?

14:21.404 --> 14:22.883
She said a friend.

14:22.884 --> 14:24.762
She didn't tell me his name.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.442
She said he didn't deal,
but he knew where to get stuff.

14:27.443 --> 14:30.124
Did her brother have anything to do
with it?

14:35.244 --> 14:37.964
It's...
it's nothing to do with that.

14:42.004 --> 14:45.762
Do I get arrested?
We will have to process the offence.

14:45.763 --> 14:48.322
Can we keep this quiet?
I could lose my license.

14:48.323 --> 14:51.844
Fix a time to come down the station,
make a formal statement.

14:55.004 --> 14:58.003
Cocaine though.
It must be a one-off.

14:58.004 --> 15:00.882
They're not that type of family.
Chloe's not that type of girl.

15:00.883 --> 15:02.762
Nobody ever is.
No, I live here.

15:02.763 --> 15:04.402
We don't have these problems.

15:04.403 --> 15:08.682
A couple of arrests for possession
every month on the estate,
but no more than that.

15:08.683 --> 15:10.604
Are you just making one for yourself?

15:10.605 --> 15:13.844
Ellie,
you might want to take this one.

16:16.004 --> 16:18.523
What are you doing?
Phone line.

16:18.524 --> 16:20.723
I hope so.

16:20.724 --> 16:23.403
Clean desk policy, Frank.
Yes, ma'am.

16:23.404 --> 16:25.244
Miller. Postman. Come on.

16:28.084 --> 16:31.363
Yeah, that's my round,
up past Briar Cliff.

16:31.364 --> 16:33.442
And did you work the route
last month?

16:33.443 --> 16:35.322
I've done every delivery out there

16:35.323 --> 16:37.284
for the past eight or nine weeks,
I'd say.

16:38.444 --> 16:40.563
Did you ever see Danny Latimer?

16:40.564 --> 16:42.443
Yeah, all the time.

16:42.444 --> 16:46.082
He used to deliver papers up there
to a couple of houses,

16:46.083 --> 16:48.722
including the hut.
When I heard, I thought:

16:48.723 --> 16:50.882
I've only seen him a couple of days
previous.

16:50.883 --> 16:54.322
And did you ever talk to him?
Particularly the last week in June.

16:54.323 --> 16:56.602
I might've waved
and maybe said hello.

16:56.603 --> 16:59.604
I didn't really know him to talk to.
That's it? Just hello?

16:59.605 --> 17:01.324
What else would I say?

17:05.084 --> 17:07.884
You didn't ever have a conversation
with him? No.

17:07.885 --> 17:10.083
Or an argument?

17:10.084 --> 17:12.684
What am I gonna be arguing
with a paper lad about?

17:14.364 --> 17:16.364
Where were you Thursday night?

17:17.483 --> 17:20.603
Thursday,
I'd have been with the boys.

17:20.604 --> 17:23.363
We got hammered.
Six of us, there was.

17:23.364 --> 17:27.483
Finished at four. My missus woke me
up at seven, I was out cold.

17:29.364 --> 17:32.084
We're gonna need the names
of all those you were with.

17:33.564 --> 17:36.282
But I mean you don't think I had
anything to do with it?

17:36.283 --> 17:39.244
It's just to rule things out.
Nothing to worry about.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.524
All right, thanks Kevin. Bye.

17:48.804 --> 17:50.563
Don't say that.

17:50.564 --> 17:53.283
Don't say what?
No need to worry.

17:53.284 --> 17:54.763
Why not?

17:54.764 --> 17:57.443
Don't reassure people. Let them talk.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.482
Can I just say: you can't just
rock up here and try to mould me.

18:00.483 --> 18:03.202
I know what I'm doing, and I know
how to handle people.

18:03.203 --> 18:06.564
And you can keep your broody
bullshit shtick to yourself.

18:18.524 --> 18:21.164
Can I make anyone a... cup of tea?

19:01.284 --> 19:03.684
Where's the crisps?
Why's there no crisps?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.964
You don't want crisps.
I do.

19:06.844 --> 19:09.402
Where are you going?
Where do you think? Out.

19:09.403 --> 19:10.922
You should clear it with Pete.

19:10.923 --> 19:13.522
I'm going to the shop, that's all.
Let me go for you.

19:13.523 --> 19:15.484
I want to go myself.
Give me a list.

19:15.485 --> 19:17.964
Mum, stop smothering me!

19:21.244 --> 19:23.803
Sorry.

19:23.804 --> 19:25.843
I want to help you.

19:25.844 --> 19:27.244
You can't.

20:56.444 --> 20:58.564
We're all so sorry.

21:31.044 --> 21:33.484
Beth. Beth?

21:35.884 --> 21:37.524
Are you all right?

21:41.044 --> 21:42.964
I'm pregnant.

21:53.283 --> 21:55.042
Have you told anyone?

21:55.163 --> 21:57.563
I only found out
about two weeks ago.

21:57.564 --> 22:00.282
You don't want to tell Mark?

22:00.283 --> 22:02.443
It's complicated.
Of course.

22:05.395 --> 22:08.473
Do you have anyone that you can
talk to? Your Mum, maybe?

22:08.474 --> 22:11.755
No. Not now. And don't you go
telling her either.

22:18.235 --> 22:19.874
What are you gonna do?

22:19.875 --> 22:21.995
Can you stop asking me
bloody questions?

22:21.996 --> 22:24.275
Sorry. I do that. Apparently.

22:27.755 --> 22:30.075
I'll... leave you alone.

22:35.715 --> 22:39.235
You can come and see me.
If you need to talk.

22:40.355 --> 22:42.794
I don't know if I believe in God.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.995
It's not compulsory.

22:47.155 --> 22:50.115
I've been praying for you
ever since I heard.

22:50.116 --> 22:52.355
For Danny, too.

22:54.555 --> 22:56.755
Thank you.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.795
You sure your mum and dad don't know
you're here?

23:25.796 --> 23:27.795
They're watching telly.

23:30.355 --> 23:33.035
We could go to the hills.
Have a drink.

23:34.595 --> 23:37.714
The police found the coke.
What?

23:37.715 --> 23:40.195
They were searching the house
for stuff about Danny.

23:41.435 --> 23:43.435
What did you tell them?
Nothing.

23:45.035 --> 23:47.275
Well, where did they think
you got it from?

23:47.276 --> 23:49.954
I didn't say.

23:49.955 --> 23:52.833
They didn't push it. Stop worrying.
Stop worrying?!

23:52.834 --> 23:54.433
Just cos they didn't ask today

23:54.434 --> 23:56.673
doesn't mean
they'll just forget about it.

23:56.674 --> 23:59.955
Chlo, I can't have the police round,
my uncle'd kill me, you know that.

23:59.956 --> 24:03.794
I know. Let's make this
all about you! Piss off, Dean!

24:03.795 --> 24:06.313
I'm sorry.
No. Go on, I want to be on my own.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.435
Don't be like that.
I'm serious. Go!

24:09.835 --> 24:11.915
Or d'you want me to tell
my mum and dad?

24:28.755 --> 24:30.715
Excuse me, have you got a light?

24:40.355 --> 24:42.475
Are you Chloe?
Why?

24:43.515 --> 24:46.235
I'm really sorry
what happened to your brother.

24:46.236 --> 24:49.354
I'm guessing
this meant a lot to him.

24:49.355 --> 24:53.153
What're you doing with that?
You can't leave it down there.

24:53.154 --> 24:55.833
It'll end up in the papers,
and you won't see it again.

24:55.834 --> 24:57.195
How do you know so much?

24:58.275 --> 25:01.233
I work for the Daily Herald.
I'm not talking to the papers.

25:01.234 --> 25:04.075
I know, and you're right not to.
I just wanted to bring that,

25:04.076 --> 25:06.154
to save it from being nicked.

25:06.155 --> 25:09.155
If it was my brother,
I wouldn't want strangers having it.

25:10.555 --> 25:11.954
Thanks.

25:11.955 --> 25:14.075
Can I borrow your phone?

25:16.395 --> 25:18.314
Thanks.

25:18.315 --> 25:20.155
What you doing?

25:21.715 --> 25:24.713
Look, I won't call you.
I won't come to your door.

25:24.714 --> 25:28.315
I won't stop you on the way to
the shops, like others are going to.

25:28.316 --> 25:31.274
But if you or your family
need to speak,

25:31.275 --> 25:34.595
or you just need a friend
when it's getting a bit much,

25:34.596 --> 25:37.074
you call me.

25:37.075 --> 25:39.195
And thanks for the light.

25:43.835 --> 25:45.555
Look after yourself.

25:57.295 --> 26:01.093
I mean, God knows,
it's terrible for the family, but...

26:01.094 --> 26:03.055
it's gonna cripple the rest of us,
too.

26:03.056 --> 26:05.254
I mean look at you here, eh?

26:05.255 --> 26:08.015
Saturday night
and the place is deserted.

26:08.016 --> 26:11.774
Thanks, Laurie.
I needed that pointing out.

26:11.775 --> 26:13.735
We were banking on this six weeks.

26:13.736 --> 26:16.654
With the bloody recession,
and the rain,

26:16.655 --> 26:18.893
this is the worst slump we've had
in decades.

26:18.894 --> 26:22.653
Five independent shops
we've lost from the high street,

26:22.654 --> 26:25.573
and now we're a murder town.
No-one's gonna come.

26:25.574 --> 26:29.175
You know what, Laurie? I think the
town has other concerns right now.

26:29.176 --> 26:33.014
Like Danny's family.
Well, I leave all that to you, eh?

26:33.015 --> 26:35.934
Pastoral care, and all that.

26:35.935 --> 26:39.133
You know, we've got to get rid of
that bloody great tent on the beach.

26:39.134 --> 26:42.333
Who's gonna come to a beach
with bloody CSI sat next to them?

26:42.334 --> 26:45.053
All right, stop!
It's not even been 48 hours.

26:45.054 --> 26:47.295
Eh, I'm just calling it as I see it.

26:47.296 --> 26:52.334
No, actually, you're being
inappropriate. Tone it down.

26:52.335 --> 26:55.653
You want a to-do list, Laurie?
Send some flowers to the family.

26:55.654 --> 26:59.253
Put a picture of Danny in your shop.
Collect for a cause Danny liked.

26:59.254 --> 27:02.175
Get a hold of yourself
and grieve respectfully.

27:03.695 --> 27:08.175
And then, when the killer is caught
- which I'm sure will be soon -

27:08.176 --> 27:10.574
the beach will re-open in full,

27:10.575 --> 27:13.615
and we make sure people
still come here and buy things.

27:13.616 --> 27:16.615
Until then,
be a decent person, would you?

27:19.455 --> 27:23.175
She's so right, it's embarrassing.

27:31.455 --> 27:33.374
What's that?

27:33.375 --> 27:35.775
Thai was closed,
chippie was the only place open.

27:35.776 --> 27:37.294
I can't eat that.

27:37.295 --> 27:41.055
You don't eat fish and chips?
What kind of a Scot are you?

27:47.415 --> 27:50.175
It's all there is.
Eat, or be hungry.

27:54.055 --> 27:56.493
Postman's alibi's confirmed,
four times.

27:56.494 --> 27:59.693
He was with his mates all night,
the night Danny was killed.

27:59.694 --> 28:01.695
So Jack Marshall got it wrong then?

28:03.135 --> 28:06.293
Do we have any reason
to disbelieve the postman?

28:06.294 --> 28:09.213
How's Marshall's eyesight?
Does he have any reason to lie?

28:09.214 --> 28:12.133
And do we think that
the money and the drugs

28:12.134 --> 28:16.293
found at the house are connected? Is
that cash for the supply of cocaine?

28:16.294 --> 28:18.813
You know you do this incessant
list question thing?

28:18.814 --> 28:21.573
Bam-bam-bam-bam,
so no-one's got a chance to reply.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.733
It's like you really enjoy it.
Do I?

28:23.734 --> 28:26.015
Yeah. Can I eat my dinner, please?

28:28.695 --> 28:31.095
First murder. How you finding it?

28:33.433 --> 28:34.912
Grim.

28:34.913 --> 28:37.353
What did you make of
Mark and Beth's list?

28:37.354 --> 28:39.672
Heartbreaking.

28:39.673 --> 28:44.593
Some of their best friends, Danny's
teachers, babysitters, neighbours.

28:45.673 --> 28:48.113
They're traumatised,
not thinking straight.

28:48.114 --> 28:50.592
Or smart. We never asked for a list.

28:50.593 --> 28:53.071
Maybe they're trying to direct
where we look.

28:53.072 --> 28:54.391
See you.
Good night, sir.

28:54.392 --> 28:56.591
Taking focus away from
their household.

28:56.592 --> 28:59.591
They didn't kill Danny.
You have to learn not to trust.

28:59.592 --> 29:02.811
Oh, do...? Oh right. That's what
you've been sent to teach me -

29:02.823 --> 29:04.462
the benefit of your experience.

29:04.463 --> 29:06.584
Look at your community
from the outside.

29:06.585 --> 29:08.223
I can't be outside it.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.702
If you can't be objective,
you're not the right fit.

29:10.703 --> 29:12.702
No, I am the right fit -
it's you who's not.

29:12.703 --> 29:14.862
Taking promotions
meant for other people,

29:14.863 --> 29:18.904
not accepting a coffee or a bag
of chips without a great big sigh.

29:22.730 --> 29:24.409
Sorry,...sir.

29:24.410 --> 29:29.248
You need to understand, Miller.
Anybody's capable of this murder,
given the right circumstances.

29:29.249 --> 29:32.450
Most people have a moral compass.
Compasses break.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.329
And murder gnaws at the soul.

29:36.330 --> 29:39.088
Whoever did it will reveal
themselves, sooner or later.

29:39.089 --> 29:42.168
No killer behaves normally over time.
You know the people here.

29:42.169 --> 29:45.048
Look for the out of the ordinary.
Follow your instincts.

29:45.049 --> 29:48.290
My instinct tells me
the Latimers did not kill their son.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.070
Quiet!

31:37.990 --> 31:39.549
Hello again.

31:39.550 --> 31:41.309
What do you want?

31:41.310 --> 31:43.670
DI Alec Hardy, Wessex Police.

31:44.550 --> 31:46.989
What's it about?
Anthony Ryan,

31:46.990 --> 31:50.270
who owns the hut up on Briar Cliff,
said you had the keys.

31:50.271 --> 31:51.630
I clean it.

31:52.910 --> 31:55.910
He said he'd phone ahead and let you
know to have the keys ready.

31:55.911 --> 31:57.550
My phone's dead.

31:58.830 --> 32:02.670
Well, I need the keys.
Just want a look inside the place.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.589
Why?
Routine.

32:06.590 --> 32:08.230
Is it about that boy?

32:09.350 --> 32:12.070
I'll have the keys back with you
as soon as we're done.

32:12.071 --> 32:14.190
Show me that ID again.

32:42.590 --> 32:45.069
You'll have to sign for them.

32:45.070 --> 32:47.790
I don't want any trouble
if you don't come back.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.830
Sure.

32:59.190 --> 33:01.630
Let me know
if there's anything interesting.

33:15.374 --> 33:17.572
I know we're all struggling
to understand

33:17.595 --> 33:19.916
what's happened
over the last few days.

33:20.192 --> 33:23.070
And it's at times like this

33:23.071 --> 33:27.391
that we... question... our faith.

33:30.071 --> 33:33.231
Why would a benevolent God
allow this to happen?

33:34.671 --> 33:37.471
Have we been... abandoned?

33:39.511 --> 33:41.671
I'm sure we're all asking
that question

33:41.672 --> 33:44.271
after the events of the last week.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.351
Hello!

33:49.031 --> 33:52.191
I'm sure it's just a shower,
we'll go to the playground later.

33:52.192 --> 33:55.190
I got you a hot chocolate.
I don't want it.

33:55.191 --> 33:58.749
Come on. Let's just have a bit of
time doing something normal.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.951
It can't be normal though, can it?

34:00.952 --> 34:02.870
You are safe. OK?

34:02.871 --> 34:05.390
Me and your Mum will protect you.

34:05.391 --> 34:09.109
This is a terrible,
unspeakable thing that's happened,

34:09.110 --> 34:12.069
but nothing like it
will ever happen again here.

34:12.070 --> 34:15.630
You can't know that, though, can you?
You can't be sure.

34:20.311 --> 34:22.070
Hey! Hey!

34:22.071 --> 34:25.190
I thought I'd sneak literally
five minutes. How is everyone?

34:25.192 --> 34:27.311
All right. All right, Trev.

34:29.231 --> 34:31.389
How's it going then?
Fine.

34:31.391 --> 34:32.751
You close to sorting it?

34:33.511 --> 34:35.268
Trev...
I can't talk about it.

34:35.270 --> 34:36.949
He's not bothering you, is he?

34:36.949 --> 34:39.109
All it is, is:
are we keeping the kids in?

34:39.110 --> 34:41.909
Should we be with them every second?
That's all!

34:41.909 --> 34:44.791
I just want to see my kids.
I'm sorry, Ellie.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.110
Come on! Trevor!

34:50.031 --> 34:51.911
You all right?

34:59.151 --> 35:03.470
Liz. How are you coping?

35:03.471 --> 35:06.230
Oh, it's not about me, is it?

35:06.231 --> 35:09.150
It's Beth and Mark I worry about.

35:09.151 --> 35:10.591
You're his grandmother.

35:11.791 --> 35:13.551
You can't just shut it out.

35:13.552 --> 35:16.590
This helps. It was a good service.

35:16.591 --> 35:18.951
It meant a lot to me,
and to the others who came.

35:18.952 --> 35:22.270
19 people in a town of 15,000?

35:22.271 --> 35:25.831
After the last couple of days.
Hardly credit it, can you?

35:25.832 --> 35:28.190
I swear, I've tried everything.

35:28.191 --> 35:32.391
But people never know what they need
until it's given to them.

35:32.392 --> 35:35.550
That's what we want from you.
All of us.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.670
Go out, connect with the town.

35:38.671 --> 35:41.910
I'm praying
that's why God placed you here.

35:41.911 --> 35:45.071
Our challenge is your challenge.
Help us.

35:58.221 --> 36:00.381
Miller!

36:02.551 --> 36:05.551
What is it? CCTV
from the car park below the hut.

36:07.023 --> 36:09.102
Mark Latimer.

36:09.103 --> 36:12.101
When is this? The night Danny
snuck out of his bedroom.

36:12.102 --> 36:14.261
He said he was out on a call,
what's he doing?

36:14.262 --> 36:16.383
Waiting for someone.
How do you know?

36:16.384 --> 36:18.702
I don't, but I bet I'm right.

36:18.703 --> 36:21.143
Tape's run out.
Is there another one?

36:24.263 --> 36:27.383
No. They just use the one tape and
rerecord over it, to save money.

36:27.384 --> 36:28.543
Bollocks!

36:30.063 --> 36:31.942
Sorry.
Are you done?

36:31.943 --> 36:33.462
No, no, it's not that.

36:33.463 --> 36:37.902
It's Danny Latimer you're doing,
isn't it? Why?

36:37.903 --> 36:41.301
It's something to do with water.
What are you saying?

36:41.302 --> 36:44.223
I've been told
it's something to do with water.

36:44.224 --> 36:46.142
Told by who?

36:46.143 --> 36:48.622
I...I have, erm...

36:48.623 --> 36:51.742
I have this thing where I...

36:51.743 --> 36:54.143
I get... I get messages.

36:56.103 --> 36:57.622
Psychic messages.

36:57.623 --> 36:59.741
Oh, for God's sake, who let you in?

36:59.742 --> 37:02.021
No, the thing about the water,
that's important.

37:02.022 --> 37:03.901
Don't just ignore it.
Oh, come on, out.

37:03.902 --> 37:06.343
It's something that
I'm supposed to tell you.

37:08.743 --> 37:12.303
Erm... like, he was...
he was in a boat.

37:13.623 --> 37:16.703
Like he was... he was put in a boat.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.524
Yeah, yeah.
I don't... I don't know why.

37:20.742 --> 37:23.873
And who told you this?
Where did you get this from?

37:23.874 --> 37:25.633
Danny.

37:33.433 --> 37:35.833
And state your address for the tape.

37:35.834 --> 37:38.872
57 Whitney Road, Lewiston.

37:38.873 --> 37:40.472
Where is that?

37:40.473 --> 37:43.072
Erm, it's about 30 miles from here.

37:43.073 --> 37:45.711
I cover the full region
for the company.

37:45.712 --> 37:47.551
And you're saying Danny Latimer

37:47.552 --> 37:51.313
wants us to know that he was put
in a boat before he died. Yes.

37:52.673 --> 37:56.073
And I want you to know
that nothing offends me more...

37:57.153 --> 37:59.633
than cranks wasting police time.

38:00.713 --> 38:03.232
I receive messages.

38:03.233 --> 38:07.312
I don't... I don't ask for them.
I don't question them.

38:07.313 --> 38:09.551
Did the message happen
before or after

38:09.552 --> 38:12.433
you were sent to install
extra phone lines here?

38:12.434 --> 38:14.552
After.
Amazing. I love this -

38:14.553 --> 38:17.193
the phone engineer who hears voices
from the dead.

38:17.194 --> 38:19.832
I don't want this.

38:19.833 --> 38:24.392
It comes to me. Look, you don't want
to listen, that's fine.

38:24.393 --> 38:26.433
Oh, you're a reluctant psychic.

38:27.673 --> 38:33.393
A child has died, and you come in
with this self-indulgent horseshit.

38:36.993 --> 38:39.473
Did you ever meet Danny Latimer?

38:40.753 --> 38:43.233
No, never.
D'you know the family?

38:44.433 --> 38:46.113
No, I don't think so.

38:47.353 --> 38:50.313
Do you have any evidence relating to
the death of Danny Latimer?

38:51.993 --> 38:53.753
No.

38:56.273 --> 38:59.992
Interview terminated at 6:17pm.

38:59.993 --> 39:03.153
You know what happens
around a murder, Mr Connelly?

39:03.154 --> 39:05.112
A whole industry grows up,

39:05.113 --> 39:08.912
of groupies, and rubberneckers,

39:08.913 --> 39:12.711
and people who want to touch
the case. You're just the first.

39:12.712 --> 39:15.273
Don't let me see you round here
again. Get him out.

39:15.274 --> 39:17.313
She says she forgives you.

39:19.513 --> 39:21.393
About the pendant.

39:37.513 --> 39:40.511
Every big case, these people come
crawling out the woodwork.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.711
What did he mean about the pendant?
Do you know?

39:42.712 --> 39:44.913
He has the bloody nerve
to come in our office!

39:44.914 --> 39:46.792
Check his details,

39:46.793 --> 39:49.431
find out who he is.
Rule him out, just to be sure.

39:49.432 --> 39:51.111
What are you going to do now?

39:51.112 --> 39:54.791
Mark Latimer lied to us
about where he was that night.

39:54.792 --> 39:57.431
Danny's social network profiles
from his hard drive.

39:57.432 --> 39:59.471
They've just come though,
all his posts.

39:59.472 --> 40:02.673
"3rd May: going to get a lock
on my door, keep all this crap out.

40:02.674 --> 40:06.072
7th May:
she's totally having sex with Dean.

40:06.073 --> 40:10.553
12th May: Dear Dad, remember me?
I'm the one you used to play with.

40:10.554 --> 40:13.473
12th May: I know what he's doing."

40:16.233 --> 40:17.633
See you later.

40:21.673 --> 40:23.632
Ellie.

40:23.633 --> 40:28.471
'Well, first and foremost, all of our
prayers are with the Latimer family.

40:28.472 --> 40:30.511
It's obviously a very worrying time,

40:30.512 --> 40:33.991
but we all believe the investigation
will uncover what happened.

40:33.992 --> 40:37.311
We're a very strong community, and
I hope the people who live here know

40:37.312 --> 40:40.871
that the church is here for them
to offer whatever support they need,

40:40.872 --> 40:43.353
throughout the coming days -
faith or no faith.

40:45.113 --> 40:47.113
I know the Latimer family quite well

40:47.114 --> 40:52.152
and we will do everything we can
to support them at this time.'

40:52.153 --> 40:54.193
'Reverend Paul Coates...'

40:55.313 --> 40:57.273
Hey! I was watching that.

40:57.953 --> 40:59.392
Where are you going?

40:59.393 --> 41:00.912
Mark!

41:00.913 --> 41:03.392
Mark! Mark!

41:03.393 --> 41:06.673
Well don't just stand there,
get after him!

41:19.233 --> 41:22.351
Enjoy your moment of glory, did you?
What? No.

41:22.352 --> 41:24.673
We don't need you.
We don't need your support.

41:24.674 --> 41:27.393
Your God left my son for dead!

41:29.633 --> 41:31.233
Too slow, mate.

41:32.593 --> 41:35.033
You OK? You all right?

41:45.273 --> 41:48.352
Erm, Thursday night,

41:48.353 --> 41:52.072
the night Danny went missing,
where were you?

41:52.073 --> 41:54.072
On a call-out.

41:54.073 --> 41:58.312
Call came through... I dunno,
early evening, about half six.

41:58.313 --> 42:01.351
Whole family's system had packed in,
you know?

42:01.352 --> 42:03.753
How long did that take?
Most of the night.

42:04.993 --> 42:07.913
It was a nightmare boiler,
so I was there pretty late.

42:07.914 --> 42:11.033
No. There was no call out.

42:14.033 --> 42:18.233
We have CCTV footage of the car park
at the top of Briar Cliff.

42:19.193 --> 42:21.193
You were there at 7:30.

42:24.153 --> 42:28.272
Er,...so you're snooping on me now?

42:28.273 --> 42:30.673
Well, checking CCTV in the area.

42:32.153 --> 42:35.031
Now, what did you do that night?
What am I, a suspect?

42:35.032 --> 42:38.311
The first thing we do is eliminate
people from the investigation.

42:38.312 --> 42:41.231
You tell me where you were,
who you were with, how long for,

42:41.232 --> 42:44.793
I can eliminate you from suspicion.
It's entirely methodical.

42:47.873 --> 42:50.591
You don't give me those facts,
I can't eliminate you.

42:50.592 --> 42:53.913
And if I can't eliminate you,
you're a person of interest.

42:53.914 --> 42:55.873
In the murder of my own son?

42:57.153 --> 42:59.553
I'm sure this is all
very straightforward.

43:02.833 --> 43:05.833
I er... I met a mate.

43:06.793 --> 43:11.711
You know, we drove off together,
and then he dropped me back
at the car park and er... I came home.

43:11.712 --> 43:14.553
What time?
Three or four in the morning, maybe.

43:14.554 --> 43:16.193
What's your mate's name?

43:17.433 --> 43:20.432
I can't remember.
Sorry?

43:20.433 --> 43:22.473
You can't remember
the name of your friend?

43:24.793 --> 43:27.072
Where did you go?

43:27.073 --> 43:30.993
I think we just had a drive around.
Bite to eat. Bit of a drink.

43:30.994 --> 43:33.792
You think? This was three days ago.

43:33.793 --> 43:36.153
Yeah,
and a lot's happened since then.

43:39.793 --> 43:42.112
And is there any reason

43:42.113 --> 43:44.553
you wouldn't want to tell me
the name of your mate?

43:48.193 --> 43:51.433
This is only about who killed Danny.
Nothing else.

43:51.434 --> 43:53.952
Um...

43:53.953 --> 43:56.551
It'll come back to me.
I'm just knackered.

43:56.552 --> 44:00.393
I haven't been sleeping, you know,
all the stuff on the news.

44:00.394 --> 44:02.273
Head's not straight.

44:03.473 --> 44:06.391
When you came in,
you went straight to bed? Yeah.

44:06.392 --> 44:08.633
Can your wife confirm
what time you came back?

44:08.634 --> 44:10.793
No. She was asleep.

44:12.393 --> 44:14.353
Come and see this.

44:18.793 --> 44:22.473
That's blood. And it's a match
for Danny's fingerprint.

44:23.873 --> 44:26.631
Danny was killed here?
We think so, yeah.

44:26.632 --> 44:30.431
Killed here, and then moved two miles
down the coast to where we found him.

44:30.432 --> 44:31.991
Why would anyone do that?

44:31.992 --> 44:36.231
The boys have been
all over this place. It's been
ruthlessly cleaned, except for that

44:36.232 --> 44:38.033
and something else in here.

44:41.273 --> 44:45.993
Mark, who you met -
it's a big gap in your recollection.

44:53.313 --> 44:54.872
Sorry.

44:54.873 --> 44:57.752
What?
I'm at the hut.

44:57.753 --> 45:00.111
SOCO think
it's where Danny was killed.

45:00.112 --> 45:03.991
We found his prints and some blood.
Right. Anything else?

45:03.992 --> 45:06.351
Yeah,
the whole place has been cleaned.

45:06.352 --> 45:09.313
But we've also found another set of
prints by the sink.

45:10.473 --> 45:13.993
I messaged them through to run
a match against elimination prints.

45:13.994 --> 45:16.233
'They belong to Mark Latimer.'
