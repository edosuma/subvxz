<i>¶ Just off the shores</i>

00:10.111 --> 00:11.477
<i>¶ A hideaway at sea </i>

00:11.479 --> 00:13.012

00:13.014 --> 00:15.047

Yo-ho, let's go!

00:58.993 --> 01:00.926
Ha-har!

01:00.928 --> 01:03.262
[Jake] Jake's Never Land Rescue.

01:05.198 --> 01:09.501
Ahoy, mateys. Do you want to
join my pirate crew?

01:10.937 --> 01:12.571
Great!

01:12.573 --> 01:15.941
To start today's adventure,
everybody say the Pirate
Password:

01:15.943 --> 01:17.910
Yo-ho-ho.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.012
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:20.014 --> 01:21.547
One more time.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.415
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:26.753 --> 01:28.754
[Cubby] All hands on beach.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.424
Get ready for
one awesome pirate picnic.

01:32.426 --> 01:38.197
Whoo-hoo! Buccaneer veggie
burgers and pirate pineapple
pizza! Yum!

01:38.199 --> 01:41.033
Hmm, I wonder when Jake's
getting back.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.835
[Jake cawing]

01:46.372 --> 01:51.143
Here I am. Izzy,
here's your Pixie Dust.
It really came in handy.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.045
Jake! How'd it go?

01:53.047 --> 01:58.083
- Everything shipshape.
- Great, 'cause Peter said it
was an emergency.

01:58.085 --> 02:03.555
It was. The Tiki Tree Forrest
River was jammed by a bunch of
rocks.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.758
And I had to move them, so the
trees could get their water.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.395
It's so cool that Peter asked
you to help him out today.

02:10.397 --> 02:15.100
Well, he was busy doing other
important other stuff in
the lands beyond the Never Sea.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.670
Yeah, it's tough to be
in two places at the same time.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.106
Even for Peter.
[laughing]

02:21.108 --> 02:25.944
Good thing you were there, Jake.
You were like Peter's first
mate.

02:25.946 --> 02:29.248
Wow! I guess you're right.

02:29.250 --> 02:33.485
You know, it would be awesome to
team up with Peter all the time.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.288
You mean, like, everyday?

02:36.290 --> 02:41.827
Sure, then I could fly with him
and explore all the lands beyond
the Never Sea.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.996
Oh, that would be a blast!

02:43.998 --> 02:48.534
More than that, it'd be the
greatest adventure ever!

02:48.536 --> 02:52.304
But, I'd probably miss
Shipwreck Beach,
Mermaid Lagoon...

02:52.306 --> 02:54.273
And Floating Rock Canyon.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.275
And Big Bug Valley.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.977
Yeah, I sure would
miss all that.

02:58.979 --> 03:02.381
But most of all,
I'd miss you guys.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.650
The best mateys ever!

03:04.652 --> 03:06.451
That's us all right.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.821
What was I thinking?
Never Land is amazing!

03:09.823 --> 03:14.493
I could never leave it.
Never Land forever!

03:14.495 --> 03:17.462
[all] Never Land forever!

03:19.332 --> 03:21.333
- [Jake] Whoa!
- [Izzy] What?

03:21.335 --> 03:24.736
Neat trick, Jake.
How did you do that?

03:24.738 --> 03:27.239
I... I didn't do anything.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.409
My sword just, well, vanished.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.411
So, what are we going to do?

03:32.413 --> 03:36.381
We've got to find out what
happened to my sword and get it
back.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.419
[Skully] Heads up, mates.
Check it out!

03:40.421 --> 03:44.723
[Izzy] Way-hey! The Fairies are
sending us a message through
Fairy Rock!

03:44.725 --> 03:46.325
Let's go check it out.

03:52.732 --> 03:58.270
[Fairies] The magic of the
great Forever Tree is starting
to fade away!

03:58.272 --> 04:01.273
<i>You must restore its magic</i>
<i>soon...</i>

04:01.275 --> 04:05.744
...or Never Land will disappear
this very day!

04:05.746 --> 04:08.380
Today? No way!

04:08.382 --> 04:14.186
Shiver me timbers!
The Forever Tree is what makes
Never Land so magical.

04:14.188 --> 04:17.356
Hey, I bet that's why
my sword disappeared!

04:17.358 --> 04:20.125
It was made from
the wood of the Forever Tree!

04:20.127 --> 04:24.263
And if the Tree fades away, that
means Never Land will go poof!

04:24.265 --> 04:27.766
- Just like your sword!
- What can we do?

04:27.768 --> 04:32.304
[Fairies] A little Fairy Magic
will be with you along the way.

04:32.306 --> 04:38.143
And will guide you on this
urgent and most important day.

04:38.145 --> 04:43.815
<i>Now go! You must hurry!</i>
<i>Please, do not delay.</i>

04:47.220 --> 04:50.789
Oh, no,
now Fairy Rock has disappeared.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.826
We've gotta get to
the Forever Tree, like now!

04:54.828 --> 04:59.331
I'm on it, Jake!
The Forever Tree grows
in an underground cave

04:59.333 --> 05:02.434
inside Mount Destiny,
on Never Land.

05:02.436 --> 05:07.806
Come on, let's go bye-bye
before everything else
around here goes bye-bye.

05:07.808 --> 05:13.045
Yo-ho, let's go
to the Forever Tree
and save Never Land!

05:15.348 --> 05:18.750
<i>¶ Look alive</i>
<i>it's all hands aboard now ¶</i>

05:18.752 --> 05:20.485
<i>¶ Every mate on deck </i>

05:22.121 --> 05:24.456
<i>¶ Anchors up and set</i>
<i>the sails ¶</i>

05:24.458 --> 05:28.694
<i>¶ For Never Land </i>

05:28.696 --> 05:31.963
<i>¶ Mateys,</i>
<i>this is not just adventure ¶</i>

05:31.965 --> 05:34.700
<i>¶ Mateys this is</i>
<i>never say never ¶</i>

05:34.702 --> 05:36.368
<i>¶ It's up to us or </i>

05:36.370 --> 05:40.772
<i>¶ Never Land</i>
<i>will fade away ¶</i>

05:40.774 --> 05:45.444
<i>¶ Off we go</i>
<i>to save the Forever Tree ¶</i>

05:45.446 --> 05:48.013
<i>¶ And rescue Never Land </i>

05:48.015 --> 05:51.450
<i>¶ Off we go</i>
<i>across the Never Sea ¶</i>

05:51.452 --> 05:54.386
<i>¶ To rescue Never Land </i>

05:54.388 --> 05:57.356
<i>¶ Laughing now</i>
<i>it's time to go ¶</i>

05:57.358 --> 06:00.492
<i>¶ We'll pull together</i>
<i>to save our home ¶</i>

06:00.494 --> 06:04.796
<i>¶ We can rescue Never Land </i>

06:07.033 --> 06:11.903
<i>¶ We can rescue Never Land </i>

06:15.141 --> 06:18.744
Thunder and lightning! At last!

06:18.746 --> 06:23.715
After countless days and nights,
I have finally done it!

06:23.717 --> 06:25.717
[panting]

06:25.719 --> 06:27.486
Done what, my captain?

06:27.488 --> 06:30.188
Besides working
our fingers to the bone.

06:30.190 --> 06:34.493
And me bones to the bones.
[groans]

06:34.495 --> 06:35.994
[yelling]

06:37.196 --> 06:38.563
Bumblers!

06:38.565 --> 06:40.832
Now where was I?

06:40.834 --> 06:44.703
Oh, yes, I the great and
glorious...

06:44.705 --> 06:50.208
...and humble Captain Hook,
have finally found...

06:50.210 --> 06:54.279
...the Enchanted Treasure Cave
of Peter Pan!

06:54.281 --> 06:59.785
I still can't believe how lucky
you were to have found Peter's
treasure map, cap'n.

06:59.787 --> 07:03.021
Luck has nothing to do with it,
Mr. Smee!

07:03.023 --> 07:06.291
It was clearly sitting
on the Never Land Beach

07:06.293 --> 07:10.529
just waiting for me
eagle-eye to spot it!

07:10.531 --> 07:12.464
[Sharky] Uh... excuse me, sir.

07:12.466 --> 07:15.600
But, uh, where be this
treasure cave again?

07:15.602 --> 07:19.371
'Cause all we got here
is a wall of stone.

07:19.373 --> 07:22.007
[grunts] Solid as a rock.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.109
Like me.

07:24.111 --> 07:28.447
Fools! This is a magic cave.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.149
First, I must follow
these instructions,

07:31.151 --> 07:34.319
then the treasure
will be revealed.

07:34.321 --> 07:38.757
[clears throat] "For the pirate
who seeks my great treasure,

07:38.759 --> 07:41.460
here is what ye do:

07:41.462 --> 07:47.466
flap your arms like a flying
rooster and shout
'cocka-doodle-doo'".

07:47.468 --> 07:49.334
[all] Cocka-doodle-doo?

07:49.336 --> 07:52.737
"Hop on one foot
and don't close your eyes,

07:52.739 --> 07:56.942
for you don't want to miss my
Golden Surprise!"

07:56.944 --> 08:01.446
Now stand back, ya swabs.
I have magical work to do!

08:01.448 --> 08:06.718
Cocka-doodle-doo!
Cocka-doodle-doo!
Cocka-doodle-doo!

08:09.322 --> 08:11.323
Boots and buckles!

08:11.325 --> 08:12.958
Oh, my!

08:12.960 --> 08:16.795
I'm the richest pirate captain
in Never Land! [giggling]

08:16.797 --> 08:21.366
Thank you, Peter Pan,
for your Golden Surprise!

08:21.368 --> 08:22.534
Ohhh...

08:22.536 --> 08:26.071
- Golden shiny stuff.
- Sparkly.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.373
[clucking]

08:28.375 --> 08:29.374
Geese!

08:29.376 --> 08:32.811
My treasure turned into geese?!

08:32.813 --> 08:35.914
Maybe these geese
lay golden eggs.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.683
Blast!

08:38.685 --> 08:41.486
This isn't gold, it's a trick.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.455
[man cawing]

08:43.457 --> 08:45.390
[Peter Pan laughing]

08:45.392 --> 08:51.396
Blast you, Peter Pan!
You've tricked me
for the very last time.

08:51.398 --> 08:56.468
Mark me words, one of these days
I will find your treasure.

08:56.470 --> 09:02.574
Oh, that shouldn't be too hard,
I'm sure Peter has treasure
buried all over Never Land.

09:02.576 --> 09:06.511
Especially on Pirate Island.
Oops.

09:06.513 --> 09:12.017
That's it, Mr. Smee!
Pirate Island,
where the puny pirates play.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.819
It's the perfect place
to plunder.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.388
Precisely.

09:16.390 --> 09:20.158
[Jake] Mateys,
my map says to go this way.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.495
It's those popinjays.
Hide yourselves!

09:23.497 --> 09:25.163
Hide your...

09:25.165 --> 09:28.833
Um, mateys,
you think you can step livelier?

09:28.835 --> 09:32.537
We're kind of in an
"end of Never Land" hurry.

09:32.539 --> 09:36.575
Maybe I can help. Flying is
faster than walking.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.777
I'd call this an emergency.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.681
It sure is. If we don't save the
Forever Tree's magic soon,

09:42.683 --> 09:45.951
Never Land's gonna
disappear... forever!

09:45.953 --> 09:49.621
Then it's... Pixie Dust away!

09:51.691 --> 09:56.561
[gasps] Oh, my. It sounds
like something's wrong
with Never Land.

09:56.563 --> 10:00.432
And why,
pray tell, should I care?

10:00.434 --> 10:05.570
Because, cap'n, if Never Land
disappears, all of its treasure
will go with it.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.573
And then you might never see
another gold doubloon,

10:08.575 --> 10:12.744
precious gem or
shiny bauble ever again!

10:12.746 --> 10:17.148
No treasure on Never Land?
Never!

10:17.150 --> 10:20.418
Smee! Pass out the Whirly-hooks!

10:20.420 --> 10:25.123
Let us follow those little
flying fiends and find out more!

10:25.125 --> 10:30.228
Ahhh, there's nothin'
like catchin' a breeze
and flyin' with ease!

10:30.230 --> 10:34.299
Yep, and we oughta be getting a
lot closer to the Forever Tree.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.969
Um, Izzy?
I think we need more Pixie Dust.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.804
We're dropping like an anchor.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.475
No problem.
Just a few more pinches and...

10:43.477 --> 10:44.643
[gasps]

10:44.645 --> 10:49.814
No, not this. Not now!
My Pixie Dust is gone.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.984
- Without it...
- [all] We can't fly!

10:54.620 --> 10:56.855
This is getting worse.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.624
First, Jake's sword
disappears...

10:59.626 --> 11:01.660
And now my Pixie Dust.

11:01.662 --> 11:05.530
Well, at least
I still have my map.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.699
[gasps] Aw, coconuts.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.035
My map's getting
all wonky on me.

11:10.037 --> 11:15.540
Wait a minute. Now my map is
telling us to go in this
direction.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.542
But where does this path go?

11:17.544 --> 11:22.047
[Cubby stuttering] Someplace
that wasn't even on my map a
minute ago.

11:22.049 --> 11:26.051
C'mon, crew, this way.
There's no time to lose.

11:27.119 --> 11:30.789
Bust me busted buttons!
Jake lost his sword!

11:30.791 --> 11:36.494
There's no more magic dusty
stuff for Izzy!
And Cubby's map is broken!

11:36.496 --> 11:40.799
Oh, poor sea pups!
This is a tragedy!

11:40.801 --> 11:43.134
Which I shall
turn into a triumph.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.738
While those puny pirates
try to save Never Land,

11:46.740 --> 11:50.709
I shall plunder all the treasure
on Pirate Island.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.311
Piece by piece.

11:53.313 --> 11:58.616
Follow me, boys.
To Pirate Island...
and treasure!

11:59.752 --> 12:01.319
[bird cawing]

12:01.321 --> 12:05.423
Creepin' coconuts, I know I've
never been in this place before!

12:05.425 --> 12:09.527
Ya sure? How 'bout checkin' that
old map-a-roonie of yours again?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.996
OK. [gasps]

12:11.998 --> 12:16.835
Not, OK! All the directions on
my map have disappeared!

12:16.837 --> 12:19.871
Crackers!
We're doomed, I tell ya!

12:19.873 --> 12:22.741
We can't give up, guys. No way!

12:22.743 --> 12:25.443
But everything we need is
disappearing!

12:25.445 --> 12:27.278
So, what can we do?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.614
Well, we could call for Peter.

12:29.616 --> 12:33.251
Yeah, if anyone can help us,
Peter can.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.953
[man] Maybe I can help you.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.454
[all gasp]

12:37.723 --> 12:39.724
Who are you?

12:39.726 --> 12:44.729
I am the Guardian of Never Land.
I have a message for all of you.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.332
Whoa! There's that
little light again!

12:49.869 --> 12:54.639
Who's hiding in there?
OK, OK, I'm outta here.

12:54.641 --> 13:00.445
As you have seen, things are
fading away because The Forever
Tree is fading away.

13:00.447 --> 13:05.049
Once its magic is gone,
Never Land will also disappear!

13:05.051 --> 13:09.053
All is not lost, however.
There is hope.

13:09.055 --> 13:12.590
- I was hoping you'd say that.
- So, what can we do?

13:12.592 --> 13:17.796
Well, I have come here to find
the One who will go on...

13:17.798 --> 13:19.831
...The Forever Quest.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.934
Hmm.
Catchy name, but what is it?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.970
It's a journey for the bravest
of pirates.

13:25.972 --> 13:30.341
Only the one who loves
Never Land and completes
the Quest

13:30.343 --> 13:33.444
can save Never Land
from fading away.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.014
What does this
brave pirate have to do?

13:36.016 --> 13:41.252
The Questor must get a sword
from the Forever Tree, the
Destiny Sword,

13:41.254 --> 13:46.791
then he must bring it to the top
of Mount Destiny before the sun
sets.

13:46.793 --> 13:50.495
Sounds like a big job...
but we can do it!

13:50.497 --> 13:53.932
The rules are quite clear.

13:53.934 --> 13:58.770
Only one pirate may take on this
great challenge.

13:58.772 --> 14:04.776
So, who among you
will go on the Forever Quest?

14:04.778 --> 14:06.277
[all] Jake!

14:06.279 --> 14:08.313
You should go on the quest.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.615
You're brave and clever...

14:10.617 --> 14:16.621
- You're an awesome leader...
- And you never give up, no
matter how tough things get!

14:16.623 --> 14:20.391
Saving Never Land?!
By myself?

14:20.393 --> 14:21.893
I don't know.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.895
Come on, Jake.
You can do it!

14:23.897 --> 14:26.231
But we're a team!

14:26.233 --> 14:29.734
- And we still are.
- Well, yeah, but...

14:29.736 --> 14:33.972
Jake, you can't say no,
you gotta go on the Quest!

14:33.974 --> 14:36.975
Well...
I can't let down my mateys...

14:36.977 --> 14:38.810
...or Never Land!

14:38.812 --> 14:41.980
OK, Mr. Guardian, I'm in!

14:41.982 --> 14:45.783
Excellent! You are now
The Forever Questor!

14:48.821 --> 14:52.857
- What this?
- A very special medallion.

14:52.859 --> 14:57.862
Keep this with you on your
journey, and all doors
will be open to you.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.365
Gee, thanks!

15:00.367 --> 15:06.104
Time is on the move,
so should you be. Quest on!

15:06.106 --> 15:09.540
Wow! That guy is full of
surprises!

15:09.542 --> 15:12.677
Well... I guess it's up
to you now, Jake.

15:12.679 --> 15:16.514
[sighs] I wish I felt better
about leaving you guys.

15:16.516 --> 15:20.084
Once you get started on the
Forever Quest, I bet you'll be
fine.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.353
But what are we
gonna do without you?

15:22.355 --> 15:25.223
I know!
With everything disappearing,

15:25.225 --> 15:29.093
maybe you should head
back to Pirate Island and
protect the things we treasure!

15:29.095 --> 15:33.264
Izzy? Cubby? Can you
give me your Pixie Dust pouch
and your map?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.266
Sure. But why?

15:35.268 --> 15:39.304
Maybe I can find more Pixie Dust
and fix the map.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.740
But most of all,
they'll remind me of you guys.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.876
- Aww.
- Coconuts.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.110
What a matey!

15:46.112 --> 15:49.580
Yo-ho! To Mount Destiny!

15:49.582 --> 15:54.619
Uh, Jake.
Mount Destiny is over there.

15:55.421 --> 15:56.654
Oops. [chuckles]

15:56.656 --> 16:02.060
I promise, I won't let you or
Never Land down.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.430
<i>¶ Forever Never Land </i>

16:05.432 --> 16:09.000
<i>¶ Our home will always be </i>

16:10.970 --> 16:14.005

16:14.007 --> 16:16.574
<i>¶ And it's our pirate home </i>

16:16.576 --> 16:19.811
<i>¶ But our home's in danger </i>

16:19.813 --> 16:22.847

<i>¶ Never Land waits for you </i>

17:11.964 --> 17:14.899
[bird cawing]

17:14.901 --> 17:18.703
Sure wish Cubby's map could tell
me if I'm going the right way.

17:18.705 --> 17:23.074
And getting around would be
a lot easier if I had some good
old Pixie Dust.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.377
Whoa!

17:26.379 --> 17:28.413
Where did you come from?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.918
You want me to go that way?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.956
OK, OK.
Lead the way, Little Light.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.827
Hey, wait up!

17:42.829 --> 17:45.696
Hey, I know that mountain.

17:45.698 --> 17:49.867
Pixie Peak. The Fountain of
Forever is on the other side.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.936
Yo-ho, let's go!

17:51.938 --> 17:54.072
That's where Izzy
gets her Pixie Dust.

17:58.210 --> 18:02.947
- [Cubby] You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?
- Yeah, I miss Jake.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.382
Me too.

18:04.384 --> 18:08.119
And now he's out there all
by himself on the Forever Quest!

18:08.121 --> 18:12.223
And what if he,
I hate saying it, fails?

18:12.225 --> 18:14.592
Then we're doomed for sure!

18:14.594 --> 18:17.962
C'mon, guys,
we gotta think happy thoughts.

18:17.964 --> 18:22.767
Jake isn't just saving
Never Land for us,
he's saving it for everybody!

18:22.769 --> 18:24.268
Captain Hook!

18:24.270 --> 18:28.439
That's right, Skully.
Jake's even saving
Never Land for Captain Hook.

18:28.441 --> 18:33.211
No! I mean, Captain Hook!
On Pirate Island!

18:33.213 --> 18:37.415
Dig-dig-diggity, men!
And keep on diggity-diggin'!

18:37.417 --> 18:41.285
We're not stoppin' 'til we find
every single piece of treasure!

18:41.287 --> 18:44.755
And that be me final word!

18:44.757 --> 18:48.059
Captain Hook,
what do you think you're doing?

18:48.061 --> 18:53.164
I know what I'm doing, I'm
looking for your treasure!

18:53.166 --> 18:56.667
Treasure?
Is that all you care about?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.169
What else is there?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.937
Never Land!

18:59.939 --> 19:05.009
Right now Jake is
trying to save the Forever Tree
so Never Land won't disappear!

19:05.011 --> 19:08.613
[yawning] Oh, really?
How noble of him.

19:08.615 --> 19:14.252
Don't you get it?
If Never Land fades away,
so will Pirate Island!

19:14.254 --> 19:19.524
Ah, but not before I plunder
all of its hidden treasure!

19:19.526 --> 19:24.896
Smee, bring forth
the Pirate Whammer-Jammer!

19:27.699 --> 19:30.268
What's a Pirate Whammer-Jammer?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.605
Whammer-jammering!

19:36.508 --> 19:40.311
Prepare to jam, puny pirates!

19:40.313 --> 19:42.013
Heads up, mates.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.381
Look at that!

19:47.286 --> 19:50.855
- Shiver me timbers!
- Shiver me feathers!

19:50.857 --> 19:52.890
[Cubby] Shiver me coconuts!

19:52.892 --> 19:56.627
[chuckling]
I could do this all day.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.496
And I will,

19:58.498 --> 20:04.335
until I find every
bit of treasure on this teensy
weensy itsy bitsy island!

20:04.337 --> 20:06.404
We've gotta stop him!

20:06.406 --> 20:08.139
And we will!

20:08.141 --> 20:13.144
Then yo-ho,
let's go save Pirate Island from
Captain Grabby Hooks!

20:13.146 --> 20:15.279
- Yeah!
- Yay-hay!

20:17.516 --> 20:22.053
Whoa! Slow down, would you?
I can't fly, you know!

20:23.522 --> 20:25.890
No way!

20:25.892 --> 20:29.160
The Fountain's
running out of Pixie Dust!

20:29.162 --> 20:32.830
Well, all I need
is enough to fill this pouch!

20:38.170 --> 20:43.007
Whoa! Sunken shipwrecks!
I'm not gonna let this stop me!

20:47.579 --> 20:49.547
Whoo-hooo!

20:49.549 --> 20:51.249
[grunts] Gotcha!

20:52.851 --> 20:55.620
Pixie Dust, away! [laughs]

20:55.622 --> 20:59.056
Little Light, thanks for showing
me the way here.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.693
Hey, wait up!
Where are you going now?!

21:07.866 --> 21:11.535
Whoa, Little Light,
there you are!

21:11.537 --> 21:14.538
Look, I'm not sure
why we're here.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.642
I don't think I'm any closer
to finding the Forever Tree.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.709
[Marina] Jake!

21:18.711 --> 21:21.612
Marina! Stormy! Sandy!

21:21.614 --> 21:26.984
Ahoy! We were just on our way
to Neptune City, to make sure
that all the mermaids are safe!

21:26.986 --> 21:29.620
We heard the Forever Tree
is fading away,

21:29.622 --> 21:32.256
and our underwater home is
fading away too!

21:32.258 --> 21:34.392
Boo-hoo-ba-ba-boo!

21:34.394 --> 21:38.329
That's why I'm on a quest...
to save all of Never Land!

21:38.331 --> 21:40.264
Is there anything
we can do to help?

21:40.266 --> 21:44.802
Well, I could use a new map.
One with directions on it.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.139
Hmmm.
What you need is special ink.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.374
And I know just where to get it.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.244
[Dolphin squeaking]

21:53.246 --> 21:55.680
Uh, let me get this straight.

21:55.682 --> 21:59.350
I need to get ink
from a Giant Golden Squid?

21:59.352 --> 22:02.186
Not just any old ink...
magic ink!

22:02.188 --> 22:05.523
And this squid's
just gonna give it to me?

22:05.525 --> 22:10.695
Not exactly.
But when the big fella laughs,
he leaves a trail of ink!

22:10.697 --> 22:13.764
So I've gotta make him laugh?

22:13.766 --> 22:15.032
[both] Yep!

22:15.034 --> 22:19.303
If Cubby were here, he'd say,
"This is coconuts!"

22:19.305 --> 22:23.541
[chuckles] You'll be fine, Jake.
Just hold on tight to Flo.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.276
[Flo squeaks]

22:25.278 --> 22:29.280
Well, at least this
snorkel-shell will help me
breathe underwater.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.515
I'll be like a mer-boy!
[chuckles]

22:31.517 --> 22:33.384
Can't get my Pixie Dust wet.

22:33.386 --> 22:36.554
- Will you hold it for me?
- Sure, Jake.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.390
So, is there anything else
I should... Whoa!

22:45.530 --> 22:48.399
Those fish sure are in a hurry!

22:48.401 --> 22:49.300
[screeching sound]

22:49.302 --> 22:50.301
Oh, boy!

22:52.237 --> 22:54.372
[chuckles]

22:54.374 --> 22:57.208
Ahoy to you too, Mr. Squid.

22:57.210 --> 23:02.847
I'm, uh, lookin' for some ink
for my map and I was, um...

23:02.849 --> 23:06.817
- [grumbling]
- ...wondering if you would
maybe lend me a little.

23:06.819 --> 23:11.389
- [grumbling]
- Does that mean "no"?

23:11.391 --> 23:16.394
- [grumbling]
- Giddyup, Flo! Seaward ho!

23:17.396 --> 23:19.830
Yahoo!

23:22.567 --> 23:24.535
[grumbling]

23:24.537 --> 23:26.003
[Flo squeaking]

23:40.585 --> 23:44.021
[Jake] Uh-oh. Looks like
somebody's not happy.

23:44.023 --> 23:47.625
Hmmm... maybe now's a good time
to try and make him laugh.

23:47.627 --> 23:51.095
Let's see... I could tell him
a funny fish joke.

23:51.097 --> 23:54.231
Or, I could tickle him.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.766
That's it!

23:59.538 --> 24:02.773
Shake a tail, Flo! Tickle away!

24:02.775 --> 24:04.975
[Flo squeaking]

24:04.977 --> 24:08.879
[mumbling]

24:10.549 --> 24:13.117
Thanks for the ink, Mr. Squid!

24:15.387 --> 24:17.822
Yo-ho, way to go!

24:20.592 --> 24:21.826
It worked!

24:22.994 --> 24:25.429
All right, the map is back!

24:25.431 --> 24:29.333
Wonderful waves, Jake!
We knew you could do it!

24:29.335 --> 24:33.237
Now I'm off to get a new sword.
The Destiny Sword.

24:33.239 --> 24:37.308
Then I can complete
the Forever Quest
and save Never Land.

24:37.310 --> 24:41.579
First I have to go to the
Forever Tree. Hmmm...

24:41.581 --> 24:42.746
Where is it?

24:42.748 --> 24:44.448
There!

24:44.450 --> 24:48.252
If anyone can save Never Land,
you can, Jake.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.522
Pixie Dust away!

24:51.524 --> 24:53.858
Good luck, Jake. Smooth sailing.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.326
Save the magic!

25:07.038 --> 25:11.308
I'll stop Hook's machine.
Coconuts away!

25:11.310 --> 25:14.612
[grunts] Going... going...

25:16.815 --> 25:18.382
Gone!

25:18.384 --> 25:20.017
I'll stop him!

25:23.555 --> 25:26.524
Ah-ha! Missed me!

25:26.526 --> 25:32.096
We're sunk. No matter what we
do, Hook won't stop.

25:33.899 --> 25:39.036
Hmmm... looks like the door
to the Forever Tree should be
right about...

25:39.038 --> 25:40.704
...here!

25:42.307 --> 25:44.742
Aw, boiling barnacles!

25:44.744 --> 25:46.076
[chittering]

25:46.078 --> 25:48.979
My sword is the key
for opening the door...

25:48.981 --> 25:51.382
...but I don't have
my sword anymore!

25:51.384 --> 25:52.583
[chittering]

25:52.585 --> 25:55.519
How am I going to get in?
[grunts]

25:55.521 --> 26:00.491
If I can't get
The Destiny Sword, I'll never
finish the Forever Quest!

26:00.493 --> 26:03.694
When the sun sets,
Never Land will fade away,

26:03.696 --> 26:05.563
and it'll be my fault!

26:05.565 --> 26:08.599
[chittering]

26:08.601 --> 26:11.569
[Jake] Oh, no!
It's happening already!

26:11.571 --> 26:14.538
I... I can't just give up.

26:14.540 --> 26:18.742
Never Land's way too important
to me, to everybody!

26:18.744 --> 26:21.645
I gotta find a way
to open this door.

26:25.016 --> 26:27.585
Whoa! My medallion!

26:27.587 --> 26:32.222
The Guardian said that with
this, all doors will be
open to me.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.691
I wonder...

26:40.632 --> 26:42.466
Yo-ho, way to go!

26:42.468 --> 26:47.037
I'm in!
Forever Tree, here I come!

26:47.039 --> 26:49.506
Wheeeee!

26:54.613 --> 26:59.216
Whoa-no! The Forever Tree,
it's fading fast!

27:00.485 --> 27:02.152
[grunts]

27:02.154 --> 27:05.456
If it disappears,
I'll never get a new sword!

27:05.458 --> 27:07.424
But I'm not giving up.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.494
<i>¶ Forever Tree</i>
<i>don't fade away ¶</i>

27:10.496 --> 27:14.598
<i>¶ I'm here to help you</i>
<i>if I can ¶</i>

27:14.600 --> 27:17.668
<i>¶ I know I can </i>

27:17.670 --> 27:18.636
[blowing]

27:18.638 --> 27:20.904
¶ Come on, let's try together

27:20.906 --> 27:24.074
<i>¶ There's magic here</i>
<i>that's got to grow ¶</i>

27:24.076 --> 27:26.443
<i>¶ It's Never Land forever </i>

27:26.445 --> 27:31.115
<i>¶ Forever Tree</i>
<i>you're not alone ¶</i>

27:31.117 --> 27:36.086
<i>¶ I'll never give up</i>
<i>on Never Land ¶</i>

27:36.088 --> 27:41.458
<i>¶ Never ever give up</i>
<i>now that's my plan ¶</i>

27:41.460 --> 27:46.130
<i>¶ Forever Tree I believe you</i>
<i>will bring the magic back ¶</i>

27:46.132 --> 27:48.032
<i>¶ I know you can </i>

27:48.034 --> 27:49.933
<i>¶ And I'll never give up </i>

27:52.470 --> 27:56.006
<i>¶ On Never Land </i>

27:58.677 --> 28:02.513
Awesome!
The Destiny Sword!

28:02.515 --> 28:05.215
Yo-ho, way to go!

28:05.217 --> 28:07.584
To the top of Mount Destiny!

28:19.798 --> 28:21.532
I made it!

28:22.167 --> 28:24.735
And right before sunset.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.870
[The Guardian]
Excellent questing, Jake.

28:26.872 --> 28:32.643
Now you're one step
closer to stopping
Never Land from fading away.

28:32.645 --> 28:38.215
To restore the magic
of the Forever Tree,
raise The Destiny Sword high.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.817
That's all?

28:39.819 --> 28:42.553
Trust me, there's more.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.398
Whoa!

28:59.270 --> 29:02.406
Forever Questor, follow me!

29:04.676 --> 29:06.009
[gasps]

29:06.011 --> 29:08.412
The Forever Tree is gone!

29:10.949 --> 29:14.251
Hold on,
it's a new Forever Tree!

29:16.788 --> 29:20.124
No way! Why isn't it growing?

29:20.126 --> 29:23.627
It looks like the Forever Tree
needs more help.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.730
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

29:26.732 --> 29:28.932
Come on, Jake, join me.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.202
[both] Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

29:32.204 --> 29:35.239
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

29:35.241 --> 29:37.641
It's not working!

29:37.643 --> 29:40.911
It seems we need even more help.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.981
Something's missing and I
know what...

29:43.983 --> 29:48.719
...my mateys! When we work
together, we can do anything!

29:53.424 --> 29:55.659
Smee, Sharky, Bones!

29:55.661 --> 29:59.062
Haven't you sea slugs
found any treasure yet?

29:59.064 --> 30:01.665
We've found boots, cap'n!

30:01.667 --> 30:04.568
And some pirate booty!

30:04.570 --> 30:07.838
- Keep looking.
- [all] Aye, aye, cap'n.

30:13.478 --> 30:17.147
Blasted barnacles!

30:17.149 --> 30:20.017
Good one, Bucky!
Ringa-ding-ding!

30:22.020 --> 30:24.988
You're going to need more
than that to stop me!

30:24.990 --> 30:27.491
[gasps] Look alive, mateys!

30:27.493 --> 30:29.493
[Cubby] What's that?

30:30.695 --> 30:32.596
What in Never Land?

30:32.598 --> 30:35.999
Shoo, fly. Shoo I say!

30:36.001 --> 30:39.102
Wow, that little light's back.

30:39.104 --> 30:43.273
Oh, blasted bug! Don't you have
something better to do?

30:43.808 --> 30:45.976
I'll get you!

30:45.978 --> 30:47.244
[grunts]

30:54.385 --> 30:57.054
Abandon ship!

30:57.056 --> 31:00.858
Smee, Sharky, Bones. Save me!

31:02.861 --> 31:06.330
Here we come, cap'n. Saving you!

31:06.332 --> 31:09.700
[chuckles] What a funny little
light you are.

31:09.702 --> 31:14.137
And tricky, too. You out-snooked
that old sneaky snook.

31:16.741 --> 31:21.645
[Cubby] Hey, I think it's trying
to tell us something.

31:21.647 --> 31:27.651
I think I get it!
Jake got his new sword
and brought it to Mount Destiny!

31:27.653 --> 31:30.187
Does Jake need our help?

31:30.189 --> 31:32.756
He does? Then let's go help him.

31:32.758 --> 31:36.693
But there's no way we can get to
the mountain fast enough.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.795
No Pixie Dust, remember?

31:41.699 --> 31:43.667
Hey, how'd you do that?

31:43.669 --> 31:49.039
No time for questions, Izz.
We gotta get to Jake.
He needs us now!

31:49.041 --> 31:50.607
But what about Hook?

31:50.609 --> 31:53.176
[Skully] We don't have to worry
about ol' Feather Hat.

31:53.178 --> 31:56.179
He's all washed up! Ha!

31:56.181 --> 32:00.951
Bucky, keep an eye on Pirate
Island! See ya later!

32:04.188 --> 32:08.525
- Hey, there's Mount Destiny.
- I hope we're not too late.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.700
Guardian, I sure hope your
little ball of light found my...

32:16.702 --> 32:18.035
- Ahoy, matey!
- Whoo-hoo!

32:18.037 --> 32:19.937
We heard you needed our help,
Jake.

32:19.939 --> 32:25.909
More than ever. Shout, "Yo-ho,
Forever Tree grow," with us.
Now!

32:25.911 --> 32:28.879
[all] Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

32:28.881 --> 32:32.082
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

32:32.084 --> 32:37.054
C'mon, mateys! Let's all shout,
"Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!"

32:37.056 --> 32:38.155
Ready?

32:39.324 --> 32:41.992
[all] Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

32:41.994 --> 32:44.394
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

32:44.396 --> 32:49.299
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

32:49.301 --> 32:53.603
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!
Yo-ho, Forever Tree grow!

32:53.605 --> 32:58.008
<i>¶ Forever Never Land</i>
<i>Our home will always be ¶</i>

32:58.010 --> 33:02.412
<i>¶ And you can live in</i>
<i>Never Land</i>
<i>if only you believe ¶</i>

33:02.414 --> 33:07.017
<i>¶ An island made of dreams</i>

33:23.835 --> 33:25.535
[cheering]

33:26.504 --> 33:29.940
Way-hay! Never Land is safe!

33:29.942 --> 33:34.044
And it wouldn't have happened
without you, Jake! You did it!

33:34.046 --> 33:36.480
[all]
Yo-ho, way to go!

33:36.482 --> 33:39.383
Never Land forever!

33:39.385 --> 33:43.620
I'm proud of you, Jake.
Never Land is proud of you.

33:43.622 --> 33:49.126
Only one other has ever been
able to complete the
Forever Quest and save our home.

33:49.128 --> 33:52.129
Really?
This has happened before?

33:52.131 --> 33:55.699
Yes, a long time ago.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.168
And that other Questor was...

33:58.170 --> 34:01.138
...me! [laughing]

34:01.140 --> 34:02.839
[all] Peter Pan!

34:02.841 --> 34:06.543
- Surprised!
- You bet!

34:06.545 --> 34:11.048
You are one tricky trickster,
Peter. And I like it!

34:11.050 --> 34:12.649
[both] Me, too!

34:12.651 --> 34:16.019
I should've known you'd be
looking out for me, Peter.

34:16.021 --> 34:21.558
Oh, I wasn't the only one.
You see, I brought along a very
dear friend...

34:21.560 --> 34:22.893
[whistles]

34:25.596 --> 34:28.432
Hey, it's my friend,
the Little Light.

34:31.169 --> 34:32.736
[all] Tinker Bell!

34:35.039 --> 34:39.743
Tink! So you're the one who's
been showing me the way!

34:39.745 --> 34:45.749
Wow! You might be small,
but you've been a really big
help to us!

34:45.751 --> 34:48.852
[laughing] Hey, that tickles!

34:48.854 --> 34:53.857
Crackers! You sure are swell,
Tinker Bell! Woo hoo!

34:53.859 --> 34:57.994
I've always dreamed of being
your friend, Tinker Bell!

35:02.433 --> 35:05.969
Aww, I feel the same way
about you.

35:05.971 --> 35:09.906
Peter, this has to be the
greatest day of my life!

35:09.908 --> 35:12.776
Well, the day's
not over yet, Jake.

35:12.778 --> 35:17.447
Now that you've saved
Never Land, it's time for
a little reward.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.717
Sooo... let's fly!

35:20.719 --> 35:24.221
- But how?
- Just think happy thoughts.

35:24.223 --> 35:27.924
[chuckles] That's easy.
Never Land is here to stay!

35:27.926 --> 35:31.228
I... I can fly!

35:31.230 --> 35:33.230
Without Pixie Dust.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.965
[all exclaiming]

35:34.967 --> 35:37.134
Pretty cool, huh? [laughing]

35:37.136 --> 35:41.471
Now you can fly whenever you
want, as much as you want!

35:41.473 --> 35:47.177
And you can go with me
and explore
the Lands Beyond the Never Sea!

35:47.179 --> 35:50.614
Awesome! I can't wait to see
what's out there!

35:50.616 --> 35:52.983
C'mon, crew!
We're all going to...

35:52.985 --> 35:57.787
Sorry, everybody.
Only the one who completed
the Forever Quest can go.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.623
And that's you, Jake.

35:59.625 --> 36:03.260
But... but then I'd have to
leave Never Land...

36:03.262 --> 36:06.596
...and my mateys!
I don't know if I can do that.

36:06.598 --> 36:11.134
Gee, teaming up with Peter is a
dream come true for you, Jake.

36:11.136 --> 36:13.103
How can you say no?

36:13.105 --> 36:17.207
But if I say yes, I'll have to
leave you mates here.

36:17.209 --> 36:21.478
If you don't go, you may never
get the chance to do this again!

36:21.480 --> 36:26.183
Yeah, but we've always been
a team... together.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.885
Now you and Peter
will be a team.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.121
An unbeatable team!

36:31.123 --> 36:36.493
Look at it this way...
Jake and Peter Pan,
Guardians of Never Land!

36:36.495 --> 36:39.296
Well...

36:40.631 --> 36:45.235
OK, Peter, I'm with ya!

36:45.237 --> 36:48.705
Ya won't be sorry.
We're gonna have a blast!

36:48.707 --> 36:50.874
[laughing]

36:54.345 --> 36:58.481
What about you guys?
Will you be OK without me?

36:58.483 --> 37:02.986
We'll miss you, Jake, but
don't worry. We'll be fine.

37:02.988 --> 37:07.057
It's not like you'll be gone
forever. You'll visit us, right?

37:07.059 --> 37:10.393
You know I will!
We'll always be mateys!

37:10.395 --> 37:14.164
Oh, but before I go...
here's your map, Cubby.

37:14.166 --> 37:18.235
Without it, I never would have
found the Forever Tree.

37:18.237 --> 37:24.040
Wow! It's back to the way
it was before! Thanks!

37:24.042 --> 37:26.343
And this is for you, Izz.

37:26.345 --> 37:31.047
My Pixie Dust is back!
Now we can fly again!

37:31.049 --> 37:35.452
Yep! And every time I fly,
I'll be thinking of you.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.787
You, too, Skully.

37:37.789 --> 37:40.123
I don't know what to say,
except...

37:40.125 --> 37:45.295
...whenever you need an extra
hand, or a wing, we'll be there
for ya!

37:45.297 --> 37:51.368
Thanks. Thanks for being the
greatest mateys a matey ever
had!

37:53.271 --> 37:56.172
OK, Tink. [chuckles] I'm coming.

38:01.245 --> 38:03.313
[Peter cawing]

38:06.250 --> 38:08.551
- Good luck!
- Bye, Jake.

38:08.553 --> 38:11.221
Fly away, little bird.

38:11.223 --> 38:16.226
[gasps] Let's go, mateys.
Guess it's back to Pirate Island
for us.

38:18.396 --> 38:22.999
[chuckles] Hey, Jake,
betcha can't fly as fast as me.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.268
Oh yeah? Check this out!

38:25.270 --> 38:27.404
[Jake cawing]

38:27.406 --> 38:29.673
Yeah!

38:29.675 --> 38:32.976
See ya around, ya slowpoke swab!

38:32.978 --> 38:35.412
Oh, we'll see about that!

38:43.187 --> 38:44.754
Look alive, Jake!

38:44.756 --> 38:49.426
The Lands Beyond the Never Sea
go on forever and ever!

38:49.428 --> 38:53.430
Sounds awesome,
more than awesome!

38:53.432 --> 38:56.166

39:46.818 --> 39:48.718
[Skully] Moldy cheese
and crackers!

39:48.720 --> 39:52.889
I can't believe we felt for Old
Feather Head's booby trap.

39:52.891 --> 39:56.659
And I can't believe he found
our Team Treasure Chest.

39:56.661 --> 40:01.331
Oh, believe it with all your
heart, puny popinjays.

40:01.333 --> 40:04.334
I was true to me word, wasn't I?

40:04.336 --> 40:10.206
I said I was going to find
treasure here. And I did!

40:10.208 --> 40:14.878
And now sit back, relax and
watch me deal the final blow.

40:17.448 --> 40:22.352
Gee, I sure wish Izzy, Cubby
and Skully could see this place.

40:22.354 --> 40:23.787

40:23.789 --> 40:25.488
[gasps] Bucky?!

40:27.391 --> 40:31.561
- What's wrong, Jake.
- I've never been this far away
from my mateys.

40:31.563 --> 40:36.399
It just feels so strange not to
be with them. I hope they're
doing OK without me.

40:36.401 --> 40:37.734
<i>[Izzy] We'll miss you, Jake.</i>

40:37.736 --> 40:41.104

- [Jake] No way, Captain Hook!

40:53.317 --> 40:55.485
What? You're back.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.153
[all] Jake!

40:57.155 --> 41:01.624
I heard that you
were through with this place.
Gone off for good!

41:01.626 --> 41:06.095
This is my home, Hook,
and these are my mateys!

41:06.097 --> 41:09.332
If you can't behave,
then you're not welcome here!

41:09.334 --> 41:11.935
Shape up or ship out!

41:11.937 --> 41:16.339
I am neither shaping nor
shipping. I'm here to stay!

41:16.341 --> 41:20.310
We'll see about that, Hook,
after I help my mateys.

41:20.312 --> 41:25.582
Men, stop that blasted boy.
He's trying to ruin me fun!

41:25.584 --> 41:27.584
I... I got him!

41:27.586 --> 41:31.087
[all mumbling]

41:31.089 --> 41:34.491
Sorry, guys,
can't let you stop me!

41:35.526 --> 41:38.027
[Hook mumbling]

41:40.197 --> 41:41.764
Tinker Bell!

41:43.267 --> 41:46.703
So, you're the bug that never
goes away!

41:46.705 --> 41:50.607
Ya better not get on
Tink's bad side,
Captain Codfish.

41:50.609 --> 41:53.977
When she gets mad,
she stays mad!

41:53.979 --> 41:55.612
[all] Peter!

41:55.614 --> 41:59.682
You didn't think I'd forget
about my favorite mateys,
did ya?

41:59.684 --> 42:05.188
Pan?! What is this?
A family reunion?!

42:05.190 --> 42:08.892
[chuckles] I guess you can
say it is, Hook.

42:08.894 --> 42:11.628
- Wanna join us?
- Never!

42:11.630 --> 42:15.198
Neither puny pirates,
nor pesty Pans,

42:15.200 --> 42:19.969
nor tiny Tinks
will ever best Captain Hook!

42:22.139 --> 42:25.208
Ah-ha! I got ya!

42:25.210 --> 42:28.378
Hey, let her go you... [groans]

42:31.916 --> 42:35.218
Jingle-jangle all you like,
Tinker-tot,

42:35.220 --> 42:39.822
but I've got
high-flying plans for you!

42:39.824 --> 42:42.559
I always knew
you were good for something!

42:44.328 --> 42:47.664
Come on, mates. We've gotta help
Peter save Tink.

42:48.766 --> 42:49.866
Awesome!

42:49.868 --> 42:51.401
Thanks, Jake!

42:51.403 --> 42:55.905
Make way for the mighty,
flying <i>Jolly Roger!</i>

42:57.074 --> 42:58.541
- Oh, no!
- Whoa!

42:58.543 --> 43:01.778
- Flying fish sticks!
- How'd that happen?

43:01.780 --> 43:05.882
[Hook laughing]
Who needs Never Land?

43:05.884 --> 43:09.385
Thanks to this Pixie
Dusting pest,

43:09.387 --> 43:13.389
I can fly to the
Lands Beyond the Never Sea

43:13.391 --> 43:17.594
and get all the treasure
I could ever want!

43:17.596 --> 43:23.533
C'mon, Jake. Let's show Hook
that his ship isn't the only
thing that can fly!

43:23.535 --> 43:25.635
I'm right behind ya, Peter!

43:36.914 --> 43:39.449
Oh, would you stop fussing?

43:39.451 --> 43:43.386
One more peep and it's the
bottom of the Never Sea for you!

43:43.388 --> 43:45.388
I don't think so, Hook!

43:45.390 --> 43:50.660
Oh, buckets of bilge-water!
It's not fair to sneak
up on Captain Hook!

43:50.662 --> 43:56.499
Ha! You're the last
pirate to tell us
what's fair, ya crooked codfish!

43:57.601 --> 44:00.637
Oh, you want to fly away?

44:04.775 --> 44:06.042
Then go!

44:10.681 --> 44:15.151
Jake, you take care of Hook!
I've gotta save Tink!

44:17.688 --> 44:19.956
It's just you and me, Hook!

44:19.958 --> 44:24.260
You know, I almost admire your
swash-buckle, lad,

44:24.262 --> 44:28.665
but you're wasting your time.
I'm in this for treasure,

44:28.667 --> 44:32.769
and you are in my way.
But not for long.

44:35.606 --> 44:37.407
Let's show 'em, Bucky!

44:39.777 --> 44:41.144
Blast!

44:41.146 --> 44:44.147
[Jake laughing]
Just try to catch me, Hook.

44:44.149 --> 44:45.915
[Hook] Get back here, you!

44:52.623 --> 44:54.023
I got ya!

44:55.793 --> 44:58.728
How was your swim, Tink?

44:58.730 --> 45:02.799
Hey, quit it. I was just
kidding. [chuckles]

45:06.570 --> 45:09.706
[Hook] Stand still,
ya shipwreck!

45:22.186 --> 45:24.187
[Jake laughing]

45:24.189 --> 45:27.724
Oh, where did that
confounded craft go?

45:27.726 --> 45:29.325
[Bucking dinging]

45:29.327 --> 45:31.227
[Jake cawing]

45:31.895 --> 45:34.130
I got you now, Hook!

45:35.432 --> 45:38.401
That's what you think. [grunts]

45:38.403 --> 45:41.070
Barnacles!

45:41.072 --> 45:42.939
[grunting]

45:44.675 --> 45:46.676
[Hook yelling]

45:48.345 --> 45:49.946
Give up, Captain Hook!

45:50.881 --> 45:52.782
I never give up!

45:52.784 --> 45:54.684
Neither do I!

45:54.686 --> 45:58.020
Time to put an end to this, lad!

46:01.125 --> 46:05.728
Is it true that Pixie Dust stops
working when it gets wet?

46:05.730 --> 46:08.197
[Jake chuckles]
Afraid so, Captain Hook.

46:08.199 --> 46:12.201
[Hook] Save me, Jake...!

46:17.975 --> 46:21.644
My word! Jake!

46:21.646 --> 46:25.181
- You...
- You're welcome, Captain Hook.

46:26.884 --> 46:29.752
[Peter chuckles]
Good work, Jake!

46:29.754 --> 46:31.788
Thanks, Peter!

46:31.790 --> 46:36.559
So, I guess now you'll be going
back with Peter to the
Lands Beyond the Never Sea?

46:36.561 --> 46:39.328
Actually...
I'm not going anywhere.

46:39.330 --> 46:40.897
[all] You're not?!

46:40.899 --> 46:42.765
My place is here with you.

46:42.767 --> 46:46.402
We're not just a crew...
we're not just a team...

46:46.404 --> 46:47.770
...we're family.

46:47.772 --> 46:49.839
[chuckles] Even them.

46:49.841 --> 46:53.843
Thanks, Jake.
We feel the same way.

46:53.845 --> 46:58.181
Peter, it would
have been great fun
going on adventures with you...

46:58.183 --> 47:02.785
...but it's me and my mateys
all the way on Never Land,
forever.

47:02.787 --> 47:07.323
I totally understand, Jake.
It's your destiny.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.926
It was meant to be.

47:09.928 --> 47:13.863
Woo-hoo!
Heads up! Falling stars!

47:13.865 --> 47:17.934
Those aren't stars...
those are...

47:19.670 --> 47:21.838
[all] Gold doubloons!

47:21.840 --> 47:23.973
With our faces on 'em!

47:23.975 --> 47:26.876
- I got a Skully!
- I got a Bucky!

47:26.878 --> 47:29.679
[chuckles] I got a Cubby!

47:29.681 --> 47:33.716
And I've got...
a Peter Pan?!

47:33.718 --> 47:39.822
Captain, I'll trade you two
Jakes and a Cubby
for a Peter Pan.

47:39.824 --> 47:44.861
You can have it!
I want one
with me own picture on it!

47:44.863 --> 47:48.364
[giggles] This is fun!

47:48.366 --> 47:54.370
Way-hay! For saving Never Land,
we got more gold doubloons than
we've ever had!

47:54.372 --> 47:58.741
I think we're going to need a
bigger Team Treasure Chest.

47:58.743 --> 48:01.911
<i>¶ Forever Never Land </i>

mateys. Come on!
