WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:05.660
So now you and Ben are officially donezo,

00:06.033 --> 00:07.705
any plans to get back in the saddle?

00:07.954 --> 00:11.669
My masseur is single and
he has a beautiful ponytail.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.675
Oh, no, you know, I think
once you get divorced,

00:14.676 --> 00:17.712
that part of you that
notices men just kind of dies.

00:17.932 --> 00:19.384
- Thanks, Bill.
- You got it.

00:19.384 --> 00:21.094
Like how after I graduated medical school,

00:21.095 --> 00:22.155
I just forgot everything.

00:22.155 --> 00:25.341
See, I don't know, 'cause when
Mother divorced Sheik Abdul,

00:25.437 --> 00:27.331
she swore she would never date again.

00:27.356 --> 00:29.047
Two weeks later, she meets Larry King.

00:30.023 --> 00:32.134
- Whoa, who 'dat?
- Yikes.

00:32.356 --> 00:36.156
Schwing. Um, hello. Hi, sir.

00:36.156 --> 00:37.909
We couldn't help but
notice that you look lost.

00:37.910 --> 00:39.996
- Can we help you find something?
- Or someone?

00:39.997 --> 00:42.877
Oh, Mormon missionaries.
Thanks, but I'm not interested.

00:42.878 --> 00:45.090
Ha, ha, no, no, no, no,
no, no, we're not religious.

00:45.091 --> 00:46.440
We just thought you might be lost,

00:46.440 --> 00:48.310
and we'd be sad if anything
were to happen to you.

00:48.335 --> 00:49.163
Why?

00:49.188 --> 00:50.718
Because you're handsome,
man. What's your deal?

00:50.719 --> 00:52.971
I'm Jeremy. This is my
single friend, Mindy.

00:52.996 --> 00:54.194
Hi.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.586
Hey, I'm not lost, I'm David.

00:56.587 --> 00:58.236
Sorry, I was checking out this building.

00:58.424 --> 01:00.382
I'm a big architecture buff.

01:00.413 --> 01:02.666
Oh, no way! Me too! You know
this building was actually

01:02.667 --> 01:05.379
built as a brothel, and
when it rains, you can still

01:05.381 --> 01:06.733
catch a whiff of <i>parfum.</i>

01:06.766 --> 01:08.894
I too love architecture.
My favorite building?

01:08.895 --> 01:10.522
The M&M building in Times Square.

01:10.523 --> 01:12.401
- Cool, that's a nice one.
- Yeah.

01:12.402 --> 01:14.321
We actually work here at
Schulman and Associates.

01:14.322 --> 01:15.700
We're doctors, but don't be intimidated!

01:15.701 --> 01:16.988
I'm not that smart.

01:17.621 --> 01:21.377
Wow, funny and friendly. Are
you sure you're New Yorkers?

01:23.132 --> 01:25.761
You know, I have a patient right now,

01:25.762 --> 01:28.141
but if you're interested, maybe
we could go get lunch sometime.

01:28.191 --> 01:29.710
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.

01:29.735 --> 01:31.529
Perfect! I mean, I'm on a broth cleanse,

01:31.563 --> 01:33.023
but I could just bring the Thermos.

01:33.064 --> 01:34.775
Actually, you know what? Sod
it, I deserve to be naughty.

01:34.776 --> 01:36.445
No, Jeremy, you can't go, 'cause remember

01:36.446 --> 01:38.031
you have to get your shin looked at?

01:38.032 --> 01:39.993
I don't know what you mean.

01:39.994 --> 01:42.395
- I'm good with the broth.
- So it'll just be you and me.

01:47.012 --> 01:49.131
Synced and corrected by louvette

01:49.615 --> 01:51.374
He hasn't expressed romantic interest,

01:51.401 --> 01:53.488
but I feel it could last forever.

01:54.229 --> 01:57.789
Wow. Not cool. I just read
the RSVP's for mine and Anna's

01:57.790 --> 02:00.762
housewarming party; all
of you said you're coming.

02:00.815 --> 02:03.320
I have never been more offended.

02:03.393 --> 02:04.365
Why?

02:04.409 --> 02:06.359
Because clearly a prank is afoot.

02:06.553 --> 02:08.180
I know none of you are coming.

02:08.181 --> 02:09.746
Look, I know the theme of the party...

02:09.765 --> 02:11.769
come dressed as your favorite
Meryl Streep character...

02:11.770 --> 02:14.136
is a tad outré. Fine, I am a tad outré,

02:14.166 --> 02:16.044
but this is just cruel. And you know what?

02:16.045 --> 02:17.965
Sod it. Sod you, the party's cancelled.

02:17.966 --> 02:20.210
What? Jeremy!

02:20.250 --> 02:21.877
We're all coming to your party.

02:21.878 --> 02:23.548
If you cancel it, I will kill myself.

02:23.573 --> 02:24.793
What are you talking about?

02:24.830 --> 02:26.707
Are you kidding me? I have
the chance to express myself

02:26.709 --> 02:29.589
through a strong female
character? I live for this.

02:29.647 --> 02:30.747
Really?

02:30.747 --> 02:32.791
Yeah, Dr. Reed. You picked
the one actress in America

02:32.792 --> 02:36.025
that everyone can get behind.
And she is so good at accents.

02:36.050 --> 02:40.550
She's all, "If I must, I chose my son."

02:41.353 --> 02:43.856
She's so talented, I
can ignore her politics.

02:43.857 --> 02:46.237
And she seems genuinely
excited to be nominated

02:46.238 --> 02:48.616
for awards, even the Golden Globes.

02:48.617 --> 02:51.747
Yeah, she actually attends the
ceremony, unlike some people,

02:51.748 --> 02:53.259
Maggie Smith!

02:53.375 --> 02:55.378
Darling, it's real. They
were all just discussing

02:55.378 --> 02:56.796
the costumes they were going to wear.

02:56.797 --> 02:58.550
Guys, I'm so sorry. I'm floored.

02:58.551 --> 03:00.313
I'll see you at the party.

03:00.805 --> 03:01.931
So, anyways...

03:02.269 --> 03:03.032
Huh?

03:03.522 --> 03:04.927
Still not a prank!

03:05.276 --> 03:07.822
I know that. I know.

03:12.374 --> 03:14.627
So how's NYU going for you, Micaela?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.171
Is your roommate still stealing your yogurt

03:16.172 --> 03:17.465
out of your mini-fridge?

03:17.466 --> 03:19.948
Nope, she did semester at
sea, and the boat disappeared.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.410
Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

03:22.955 --> 03:24.469
Now, so what can I do for you today?

03:24.469 --> 03:26.555
I was actually thinking
about getting an IUD.

03:26.556 --> 03:30.271
Oh, Micaela, I don't know.
I don't recommend an IUD

03:30.272 --> 03:32.109
unless a patient really
doesn't want to have children

03:32.110 --> 03:33.596
for a very long time.

03:33.608 --> 03:36.075
There's no way I'm bringing
a child into this crazy world.

03:36.135 --> 03:37.809
Did you know that all the bees are dying?

03:37.810 --> 03:38.982
And no one knows why?

03:38.982 --> 03:40.526
Oh, sure. Everything's disappearing.

03:40.527 --> 03:42.530
Icebergs, bees, our civil liberties,

03:42.531 --> 03:44.408
but this is a serious procedure.

03:44.409 --> 03:46.246
I think you should think
about it, and if you discuss

03:46.247 --> 03:47.999
this with your mother and your father...

03:48.000 --> 03:49.460
You know what? A lot
of my friends are going

03:49.461 --> 03:51.756
to this cool female doctor downtown.

03:51.757 --> 03:53.635
Maybe she'll be a little less judgmental.

03:53.636 --> 03:56.182
Judgmental? Well, my father was a judge,

03:56.183 --> 03:57.518
and my mother was mental.

03:57.519 --> 03:58.812
So...

03:58.813 --> 04:00.010
Karen!

04:00.030 --> 04:02.242
- Oh, hey, Dr. Kimball-Kinney.
- Hello.

04:02.341 --> 04:04.302
Hey, I finished polishing your rifle.

04:04.303 --> 04:06.932
- It was loaded, by the way.
- Wonderful.

04:06.933 --> 04:08.977
Now, Karen, would you be a doll,

04:08.978 --> 04:11.441
and tell me where you forwarded
Micaela Kellerman's file to?

04:11.442 --> 04:13.946
The one that dumped you
for a different doctor

04:13.947 --> 04:15.908
because you were being too patronizing?

04:15.909 --> 04:17.745
Patronizing? Sweetie,

04:17.745 --> 04:19.791
are you sure you understand that big word?

04:19.791 --> 04:21.753
I'm sorry, but I can't give you

04:21.754 --> 04:24.592
her new doctor's information due
to the Patient's Bill of Rights,

04:24.593 --> 04:27.557
a copy of which I have posted right here.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.563
Ah, Karen, I noticed that
the magazines in the lunchroom

04:30.564 --> 04:32.316
are all out of order.

04:32.317 --> 04:35.039
Code red! We got a code red!

04:35.786 --> 04:37.142
Let's see this...

04:37.831 --> 04:40.331
Patient file... sent to...

04:40.671 --> 04:42.374
Dr. Mary Hernandez.

04:43.468 --> 04:46.791
The Lower East Side?
Micaela could be in danger!

04:47.183 --> 04:49.382
Some of our most lecherous
young actors live there!

04:51.943 --> 04:54.071
Wow, so you're a mechanical engineer.

04:54.072 --> 04:55.616
I don't know anything about that.

04:55.617 --> 04:57.244
Are you like Hugh Jackman in "Real Steel?"

04:57.245 --> 05:00.291
Yes, I create robots
that then box each other

05:00.292 --> 05:02.655
for human entertainment.
It's really fulfilling.

05:03.591 --> 05:05.511
- So you're an OBGYN?
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.512 --> 05:07.180
That was my dream job when I was 14.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.892
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

05:08.893 --> 05:11.230
I mean, I get to bring
life into this world.

05:11.231 --> 05:12.859
And I also get to keep up to date on

05:12.860 --> 05:15.337
all of the new pubic hair trends, so...

05:15.699 --> 05:18.286
Um, what about your co-workers?
What are they like?

05:18.287 --> 05:19.863
Oh, the other doctors I work with?

05:19.886 --> 05:21.712
They're fine. I want to
find out more about your job.

05:21.737 --> 05:23.949
Right, but it's not just
doctors at your practice right?

05:23.950 --> 05:26.766
Like, there's nurses and
there's receptionists.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.672
- What about them?
- I don't know why you care,

05:28.673 --> 05:30.425
but if you really want to meet them,

05:30.426 --> 05:32.136
one of my co-workers is
having a party tonight.

05:32.137 --> 05:33.335
You could come with me.

05:33.683 --> 05:35.101
Absolutely. I'm there.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.398
Really? Guess it's a date.

05:37.399 --> 05:39.275
Just so you know, I'm on medication

05:39.276 --> 05:40.946
for a bladder infection,
so who knows what'll happen

05:40.947 --> 05:42.015
when I drink?

05:43.326 --> 05:45.831
Thank you for coming downtown
with me today, Morgan.

05:45.832 --> 05:48.271
I get nervous going south
of 72nd Street alone.

05:49.004 --> 05:51.341
Or North of 80th. Pardon me.

05:51.368 --> 05:52.548
You want to jump in real quick?

05:52.585 --> 05:54.922
Oh. Pardon me, I'm
sorry. Just for a moment.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.549
- Sorry.
- Pardon me, Miss.

05:56.550 --> 05:58.803
Excuse me, Miss? Just one quick...

05:58.804 --> 06:00.766
- Oh! Jesus! Oh!
- Are you all right?

06:00.767 --> 06:03.230
- No!
- Hola, little amigo.

06:04.071 --> 06:06.596
Hey, I like your necklace. Muy brillante.

06:06.618 --> 06:08.121
Do you want something?

06:08.122 --> 06:10.366
- Uh, si.
- You're weird.

06:10.432 --> 06:11.730
Do you want me to handle this young man?

06:11.789 --> 06:14.276
No. Listen, I'll buy you a horchata

06:14.276 --> 06:16.947
if you tell me where I can
find Dr. Mary Hernandez.

06:16.948 --> 06:18.564
I'm Dr. Mary Hernandez.

06:20.330 --> 06:23.125
Dr. Hernandez, when I saw that my patient,

06:23.126 --> 06:25.631
Micaela Kellerman, decided
to leave me and seek care

06:25.632 --> 06:27.593
with you, I noticed a couple of red flags.

06:27.594 --> 06:30.474
He's referring to your
gender and your race.

06:30.475 --> 06:32.018
Oh, my. I can't imagine why a patient

06:32.019 --> 06:33.355
would ever want to leave you.

06:33.355 --> 06:36.615
No, madam. He didn't mean
that, he's overstimulated.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.104
He just took his first taxi ride.

06:38.105 --> 06:39.774
It's true. It was amazing.

06:39.775 --> 06:42.362
Taxi TV. Michael Strahan was talking to me,

06:42.363 --> 06:43.325
like we're best friends.

06:43.356 --> 06:45.316
Okay, I don't want to be
rude, but I'm very busy,

06:45.365 --> 06:47.952
and this seems like nonsense.

06:47.985 --> 06:51.450
Dr. Hernandez, my patient
Micaela was upset with me

06:51.451 --> 06:53.662
the other day, and rashly
decided to leave me.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.833
The thing is, she's a
nice girl from a nice home,

06:55.834 --> 06:57.169
and I think our practice would be

06:57.170 --> 06:58.839
much more appropriate for her.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.219
Dr. Kimball-Kinney, I know that

07:01.220 --> 07:03.515
the Five Points Community
Clinic doesn't offer

07:03.516 --> 07:06.855
the plush creature comforts
of your Park Avenue practice.

07:06.856 --> 07:08.442
Yes, we don't have a lot of money.

07:08.443 --> 07:11.191
Yes, our posters are a little outdated.

07:11.783 --> 07:14.370
So you agree with me then, well, fantastic.

07:14.371 --> 07:16.205
Tell Micaela I'll see her in two weeks.

07:16.245 --> 07:19.320
Why would I ever send her back?

07:19.380 --> 07:22.134
We're the highest-rated women's
healthcare clinic in the city!

07:22.712 --> 07:24.046
Including yours.

07:24.046 --> 07:27.594
That can't be possible.
I suspect voter fraud.

07:27.596 --> 07:30.192
So while I can't offer her spa water

07:30.233 --> 07:32.421
or condescending, patriarchal advice,

07:32.446 --> 07:34.602
what I can provide her with is

07:34.627 --> 07:36.649
the best women's healthcare in Manhattan,

07:36.649 --> 07:39.843
and we do it for free. ¿Comprende, cabron?

07:39.843 --> 07:42.054
Yeah, we do. Oh!

07:42.760 --> 07:44.238
The Chupa Chups are for the kids.

07:49.208 --> 07:52.794
Oh! Karen! "The Devil Wears Prada."

07:52.827 --> 07:55.270
- I love it.
- Thanks. Who are you?

07:55.303 --> 07:57.850
Oh, I'm Karen Blickson
from "Out of Africa."

07:57.851 --> 08:00.564
I already owned the costume.
My family colonized Zimbabwe.

08:00.565 --> 08:03.945
If you like Anna's
costume, you will love mine.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.273
Whoa.

08:05.295 --> 08:07.730
Jeremy, darling, you
look even more wonderful

08:07.755 --> 08:09.382
- than your sketches.
- Thank you.

08:09.383 --> 08:12.639
Oh damn, Dr. Reed. Who are you?

08:12.640 --> 08:13.762
Surely you're joking.

08:13.969 --> 08:16.681
I'm obviously Florence Foster Jenkins.

08:19.904 --> 08:22.577
- Oh, come on. You said it was...
- That was spot on.

08:24.831 --> 08:27.641
Francesca, "Bridges of
Madison County," right?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.187
Dr. Kimball-Kinney.

08:30.212 --> 08:33.724
- Oh yes, of course, Dr. Gonzalez.
- Hernandez.

08:33.749 --> 08:35.047
What are you doing here?

08:35.047 --> 08:36.883
Oh, dear, you're not
catering on the side, are you?

08:36.884 --> 08:38.886
Because your patients don't have any money?

08:38.888 --> 08:42.455
No, Anna invited me. We went
to medical school together.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.990
You went to Harvard Medical School?

08:43.991 --> 08:46.015
The Florida State University of the North?

08:46.487 --> 08:48.824
Then why are you working in a
clinic with a metal detector?

08:48.825 --> 08:51.079
It's not great. I can't
wear an underwire bra

08:51.080 --> 08:53.208
without setting it off, but it's worth it.

08:53.209 --> 08:55.212
I get to help patients in need.

08:55.213 --> 08:57.008
I'm guessing that you
don't understand that.

08:57.009 --> 08:59.607
Well, that is not true.
I am very altruistic.

08:59.722 --> 09:01.016
If a patient doesn't have insurance,

09:01.017 --> 09:02.363
I make sure they're very rich

09:02.408 --> 09:03.928
before I make them pay out of pocket.

09:03.965 --> 09:05.890
Wow, that is truly moving.

09:06.051 --> 09:08.095
I should go before I start to cry.

09:08.528 --> 09:11.907
I've been up in New York long
enough to recognize sarcasm,

09:11.932 --> 09:13.727
and to think just a moment ago,

09:13.728 --> 09:15.480
I was considering asking you to dinner.

09:15.512 --> 09:17.238
Oh, no!

09:17.263 --> 09:19.766
Did I miss my chance to go out with you?

09:19.767 --> 09:23.554
Well, no, not quite,
but you... Oh, damn it.

09:24.696 --> 09:26.468
I feel like I'm in that "Seinfeld" program.

09:26.469 --> 09:29.390
Wow, oh my gosh.

09:29.391 --> 09:31.019
David, thank you so much for coming

09:31.020 --> 09:32.633
to this costume party with me.

09:32.658 --> 09:33.848
Of course.

09:33.926 --> 09:37.709
And might I add, you make
a stunning Julia Child.

09:37.738 --> 09:40.638
Oh thank you! I actually ate
an entire boeuf bourguignon

09:40.638 --> 09:42.014
in preparation for the role.

09:42.061 --> 09:43.914
- Oh, hi, Jody!
- Oh, hello.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.803
What Meryl Streep character are you?

09:45.844 --> 09:47.650
I'm Gail from "River Wild" obviously.

09:47.699 --> 09:48.889
Oh, I haven't seen it.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.225
Are you crazy? It's wonderful.

09:51.226 --> 09:53.563
You try to disarm
criminal madman Kevin Bacon

09:53.564 --> 09:55.490
while tackling category five rapids.

09:55.515 --> 09:56.647
It's not easy.

09:56.687 --> 09:59.153
David! You made it!
Fantastic! Don't go anywhere.

09:59.189 --> 10:01.400
I have three costume
changes throughout the night.

10:03.451 --> 10:05.413
Cool, now is this everybody?

10:05.414 --> 10:07.494
I thought you said your
entire office was coming.

10:07.495 --> 10:09.912
Uh, believe it or not,
those are the two coolest.

10:09.961 --> 10:11.566
- Do you want to meet them?
- Yeah.

10:11.591 --> 10:12.499
Okay.

10:12.527 --> 10:14.253
♪ Rock and roll will never die ♪

10:14.278 --> 10:17.259
Hey, guys. For some reason,
David really wanted to meet you.

10:17.294 --> 10:19.297
David, this is Tamra and Morgan.

10:19.298 --> 10:21.845
Hey, I'm dressed as Meryl
from "Death Becomes Her."

10:21.906 --> 10:23.617
I was gonna do "Sophie's Choice,"

10:23.617 --> 10:25.453
but everyone kept saying I
looked too hot in the costume.

10:25.454 --> 10:27.959
Oh, yeah. I am Ricki from
"Ricki and the Flash."

10:27.960 --> 10:30.279
My favorite movie. Yeah!

10:32.093 --> 10:34.638
Oh, Beverly, you must be the
Witch from "Into the Woods."

10:34.639 --> 10:36.601
Nah, I'm just Beverly.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.726
I can't believe this is happening.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.498
You're Beverly?

10:41.523 --> 10:43.539
- Who's askin'?
- I am.

10:44.738 --> 10:45.948
I'm your son.

10:48.489 --> 10:49.595
Sorry.

10:52.972 --> 10:55.385
Oh my God! Beverly, David's your son?

10:55.438 --> 10:57.650
It's true. She left me in a basket in front

10:57.651 --> 11:00.614
of a Jazzercise studio! It was 1982.

11:00.615 --> 11:02.743
Hold on! I'm so sorry.
The similarities between

11:02.744 --> 11:05.374
this situation and the plot
of "Ricki and the Flash,"

11:05.375 --> 11:08.834
which, once again, is my
favorite movie, are stunning.

11:08.882 --> 11:12.174
It's a good story, but how do
I know I'm really your mother?

11:12.215 --> 11:14.008
Well, I was left with a cassette tape,

11:14.009 --> 11:15.970
- Oh, quiet!
- Everybody be quiet! Be quiet!

11:15.971 --> 11:18.016
- Listen! There's a cassette!
- Dr. K, come here please.

11:18.017 --> 11:19.600
- Come here, listen.
- Turn the music down, Mike.

11:19.673 --> 11:23.419
Hi, whoever finds this baby,
please take good care of him.

11:23.546 --> 11:25.758
He likes a little Jim Beam in his bottle.

11:25.759 --> 11:28.555
Don't come looking for me,
you'll never find me.

11:28.589 --> 11:29.989
Bus leaving for New York City!

11:30.051 --> 11:32.556
Okay, I gotta go. Bye, little David.

11:32.557 --> 11:35.645
Have a nice life. Love, your mom, Beverly.

11:35.646 --> 11:38.316
- Oh, come on.
- Okay, what do we know?

11:38.317 --> 11:39.579
It's clearly Beverly.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.301
Play it back. I'm gonna really listen.

11:41.751 --> 11:44.539
Mom, is there somewhere we can

11:44.564 --> 11:46.359
speak in private?

11:47.313 --> 11:48.552
I have to go!

11:48.578 --> 11:50.889
Bev, Bev, Bev, Bev! Ah! She's my ride!

11:53.708 --> 11:57.617
Wow, my mom just rejected me again.

11:57.642 --> 12:01.482
David, Beverly is an odd
duck. And I'm sure she wants

12:01.483 --> 12:02.810
to get to know you, too, you know?

12:02.854 --> 12:04.355
Hey, why don't you come
to the office tomorrow

12:04.356 --> 12:06.174
and talk to her one on one?

12:06.174 --> 12:07.482
Yeah, you're right, and maybe
I shouldn't have sprung it

12:07.507 --> 12:08.801
on her like this.

12:08.842 --> 12:10.344
What did I miss, everyone?

12:11.920 --> 12:14.222
Oh, it looks like a dingo ate my party.

12:18.392 --> 12:21.647
Beverly, what the hell?
You were awful last night!

12:21.648 --> 12:25.154
All right, all right.
You can have it all back.

12:25.155 --> 12:26.176
My God.

12:26.198 --> 12:29.738
My inhaler! I had to go
to the hospital last night.

12:29.785 --> 12:31.412
I'm allergic to wig glue.

12:31.413 --> 12:33.875
No, not that! I was obviously talking

12:33.876 --> 12:35.754
about the way you acted around David,

12:35.755 --> 12:37.877
your hot and incredibly sweet son.

12:37.877 --> 12:39.880
Lucky for you, I used
my charm and good looks

12:39.881 --> 12:41.592
to get him to come here
today for a do-over.

12:41.593 --> 12:44.764
Why'd you do that? I don't want to see him!

12:44.765 --> 12:46.602
I'll make him another cassette.

12:46.603 --> 12:48.814
Beverly, he's your son!

12:48.815 --> 12:50.801
He deserves a chance to talk to you.

12:50.828 --> 12:51.934
I don't know, guys.

12:51.975 --> 12:53.477
Maybe we're being too hard on her.

12:53.478 --> 12:55.597
I never knew my parents,
and I turned out...

13:01.034 --> 13:02.870
Oh, my God, my Lego man!

13:02.917 --> 13:06.216
All right, all right! I'll talk to him.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.984
Thank God I'm wearing my fanciest outfit.

13:09.037 --> 13:12.773
Corduroy skirt and a bolo tie. Watch this.

13:13.254 --> 13:14.881
Your closet or mine?

13:14.882 --> 13:18.221
Mm, I don't know. I feel like a narc.

13:18.222 --> 13:19.558
Are you kidding me?

13:19.559 --> 13:21.687
That's Patricia Heaton for Kohl's!

13:21.688 --> 13:23.566
You've never worn
anything better than that.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.443
It is chic. No, but, Beverly,

13:25.444 --> 13:27.281
tell me the topics that
are safe to talk about.

13:27.282 --> 13:30.632
My cats, excitement for Christmas,

13:30.805 --> 13:31.921
Pier 1.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.530
- Yes.
- Good, good, good.

13:33.531 --> 13:35.994
- How to throw a knife!
- No! No way.

13:35.995 --> 13:37.939
How to get a knife
through airport security.

13:37.939 --> 13:39.440
- No knives.
- I think we avoid the knives.

13:39.441 --> 13:41.340
Oh, hell. Then what's the point?

13:42.327 --> 13:44.163
Okay, Beverly, think about it this way.

13:44.163 --> 13:46.541
Wouldn't it be nice for
you to have a relationship

13:46.542 --> 13:48.545
with your own flesh and blood?

13:48.546 --> 13:52.470
I have often thought about
when I'm lying on my deathbed,

13:52.471 --> 13:54.767
who'll be there by my side,

13:54.768 --> 13:57.230
ready to smother me with a pillow?

13:57.231 --> 13:59.025
Guess I'd rather it be kin.

13:59.026 --> 14:01.656
Damn, Beverly, you look kind of okay.

14:01.657 --> 14:03.409
That son you abandoned is here.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.224
- Aah!
- Go, go!

14:06.307 --> 14:08.755
Anna, get your beautiful
head out of that magazine.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.825
I had a miserable time
at your party last night.

14:10.826 --> 14:13.329
Your Harvard classmate accosted me,
told me I was self-centered,

14:13.330 --> 14:15.626
didn't care about the less fortunate.

14:15.627 --> 14:18.005
- That sounds accurate.
- Could not have said it better.

14:18.006 --> 14:19.717
Why am I the bad guy?

14:19.718 --> 14:21.638
No one at Schulman's is philanthropic.

14:21.639 --> 14:23.307
Meanwhile, I helpfully tell
every woman in the office

14:23.308 --> 14:24.735
to smile more!

14:24.912 --> 14:26.623
You know, we used to have
this mobile medical van

14:26.624 --> 14:28.951
that we would drive into
low income neighborhoods,

14:29.152 --> 14:31.572
but it got impounded when I
parked in the Lincoln Tunnel.

14:31.573 --> 14:34.078
Well, damn it, let's go un-impound it!

14:34.079 --> 14:36.942
- Follow me, Morgan.
- I got a lot of work, but okay.

14:41.635 --> 14:43.188
Yeah, there she is.

14:43.915 --> 14:45.462
There's the old girl.

14:46.896 --> 14:49.516
Oh my God! Whoa, whoa! Geez Louise!

14:49.541 --> 14:51.270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:51.770 --> 14:53.438
Are you sure that's safe in there, Morgan?

14:53.439 --> 14:54.483
All right, I'm gonna check it out.

14:54.508 --> 14:56.521
Yeah. I'll, uh...

14:56.547 --> 14:59.427
Oh my God, it's like a
raccoon cemetery in there.

14:59.428 --> 15:01.179
- Fabulous.
- Give me 15 minutes.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.726
Oh, my God.

15:04.346 --> 15:05.976
Come on. Come on, Bev.

15:08.146 --> 15:11.067
Dr. Reed, the hospital called.
Mrs. Morgenthal is fully dilated

15:11.068 --> 15:12.523
and ready for you.

15:12.523 --> 15:13.983
Just give her a copy of
"In Style" and tell her

15:13.984 --> 15:15.803
to take some deep breaths. Sit down.

15:15.828 --> 15:16.793
Please!

15:21.206 --> 15:24.703
Oh my God! They're
hugging! Jeremy, we did it!

15:26.617 --> 15:30.092
She was everything you could want in a mom!

15:30.117 --> 15:33.414
You know, lucid and warm, and you know,

15:33.415 --> 15:35.322
super excited about Christmas.

15:35.461 --> 15:38.674
She did talk about taxidermy
more than I would've imagined,

15:38.675 --> 15:40.846
but at least now I know how
much stuffing it would take

15:40.847 --> 15:42.767
to fill me, you know?

15:42.768 --> 15:44.603
Well, that is very surprising,

15:44.604 --> 15:48.027
because Beverly is a bit
of a controversial figure

15:48.028 --> 15:49.322
in this floor, so...

15:49.322 --> 15:51.033
What? She's the best. As a matter of fact,

15:51.033 --> 15:52.827
can you give her my business card?

15:52.828 --> 15:54.957
She's gonna e-mail me
a list of mental illnesses

15:54.958 --> 15:57.294
and addictions I'm susceptible to, so...

15:57.295 --> 15:58.382
Yeah, no problem.

16:00.432 --> 16:02.479
Huh. Wallet's gone.

16:02.998 --> 16:05.829
Had it when I was talking to her.

16:07.481 --> 16:10.810
I was sitting with her,
and she patted me...

16:13.897 --> 16:16.450
Step right up, ladies and ladies!

16:16.475 --> 16:19.308
We got the Schulman and
Associates Mobile Health Unit!

16:19.333 --> 16:22.172
We got mammograms! We got pap smears!

16:22.173 --> 16:23.673
Come on, right in here.

16:23.985 --> 16:25.461
I don't know what we're doing wrong.

16:25.486 --> 16:27.364
How am I supposed to rub
our free, quality healthcare

16:27.365 --> 16:29.618
in Dr. Hernandez's pretty
face and ample bosom

16:29.619 --> 16:31.289
if we can't get any patients?

16:31.290 --> 16:33.334
Oh! Oh! Maybe I should
dress up like a woman,

16:33.335 --> 16:35.004
and I can stand behind you and
talk about what a great doctor

16:35.005 --> 16:36.799
you are? I can do that,

16:36.800 --> 16:38.511
but it would be Ricki
from "Ricki and the Flash."

16:38.512 --> 16:40.432
It's my favorite movie. Have you seen that?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.060
Uh, excuse me, Madam. Are you in need

16:42.061 --> 16:43.563
of healthcare services today?

16:43.564 --> 16:45.312
That depends. Are you a doctor?

16:45.312 --> 16:48.118
All I see is two suspicious
men in front of a damaged van.

16:48.143 --> 16:49.395
I assure you I'm fully licensed,

16:49.396 --> 16:50.689
and I can see you right away.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.192
I just need some antibiotics.

16:52.193 --> 16:53.945
I have a really bad UTI.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.325
I held in my pee for
an entire women's march.

16:56.326 --> 16:58.162
I told people those were a bad idea.

16:58.163 --> 17:00.000
Come with me, I'll take care of you.

17:01.879 --> 17:05.259
Hey! What is wrong with you?

17:05.260 --> 17:07.180
How could you steal from your son?

17:07.181 --> 17:09.267
Yes, I take Leo's Halloween candy,

17:09.268 --> 17:10.614
but only after he's gone to bed!

17:10.614 --> 17:13.002
Well I don't know what to tell
you; I'm just a bad person.

17:13.028 --> 17:15.992
That's what everybody says,
and now I guess it's true.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.914
Hey, stop! Stop. That is not true.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.917
Remember the time I had too many margaritas

17:20.919 --> 17:23.165
at Jeremy's Miss America
pageant viewing party?

17:23.465 --> 17:25.219
And you took my car keys away from me.

17:25.220 --> 17:26.805
Yeah, but I made a copy of the keys,

17:26.806 --> 17:28.778
and I've been using your car ever since.

17:29.060 --> 17:32.190
Okay, well, what about
the time when I didn't know

17:32.191 --> 17:34.279
if I should leave Danny
or not, and you told me

17:34.280 --> 17:37.452
I would be fine by myself?
That was good advice.

17:37.453 --> 17:40.249
I just told you that 'cause
I wanted him for myself.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.892
Okay, that is ridiculous,
Beverly. Sit down.

17:44.049 --> 17:45.582
- Sit!
- Okay!

17:47.222 --> 17:49.392
I don't get it. David said that you guys

17:49.393 --> 17:50.756
were having a great talk.

17:51.093 --> 17:53.442
Why would you ruin everything
by stealing his wallet?

17:53.443 --> 17:55.813
I don't know. Why did
I steal your identity?

17:55.813 --> 17:57.440
It's just who I am!

17:57.441 --> 17:59.111
Okay, I didn't know you had done that,

17:59.112 --> 18:01.745
but... can I tell you what I think?

18:02.451 --> 18:04.371
I think you stole his
wallet because you wanted

18:04.372 --> 18:05.697
to push him away,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.047
because it was easier to do one bad thing

18:09.048 --> 18:11.427
than to have a relationship with your son

18:11.428 --> 18:12.805
for the rest of your life.

18:15.186 --> 18:18.221
Well, you may be right.

18:19.762 --> 18:21.660
But I also wanted a picture of him.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.479
He looks just like his dad, Tavis.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.078
Well, I think you'll feel a lot better

18:28.103 --> 18:30.190
if you go upstairs and
give this back to him.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.947
And put in a good word for
me, because you owe me now.

18:33.972 --> 18:36.313
Ha! My son can do better than you!

18:36.338 --> 18:39.097
Yeah, but he doesn't know that
yet. Just listen to what I say.

18:39.122 --> 18:41.288
All right, all right, I'm going, I'm going.

18:41.362 --> 18:44.116
Sofia, it's nice to meet
you. Here's your birth control

18:44.117 --> 18:46.454
for this month, and here's
your prescription for the rest.

18:46.455 --> 18:49.168
Oh, thanks, but uh... I
don't think I can afford this.

18:49.184 --> 18:50.688
I don't have health insurance.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.632
My word, I've been
hearing that a lot today.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.677
I thought that was something
liberal media just made up,

18:54.678 --> 18:58.142
like police brutality, but don't
worry, the prescription's on us.

18:58.143 --> 19:00.981
You know what? Next month, you
come see me at this address.

19:00.982 --> 19:03.402
I'll give you your next
pack. Pharmaceutical companies

19:03.403 --> 19:04.945
give those away like candy.

19:05.355 --> 19:07.442
Thank you so much, Dr. Kimball-Kinney.

19:07.704 --> 19:10.358
Oh!

19:16.552 --> 19:19.641
Goodbye, Paula. Remember to
take all of your antibiotics.

19:19.641 --> 19:22.394
Otherwise humankind will
be wiped out by a super-bug.

19:23.212 --> 19:24.503
And enjoy this weather!

19:26.172 --> 19:27.841
- Woof!
- Right?

19:27.842 --> 19:28.990
What a day!

19:28.990 --> 19:31.535
Man, that was just like go, go, go!

19:31.536 --> 19:32.993
And now, here we are.

19:33.033 --> 19:36.200
And yet as tired as I am, I
haven't felt this fulfilled

19:36.274 --> 19:39.487
since I felled the wild
hog that gored Grandmother.

19:40.268 --> 19:41.260
Wow.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.230
Well, well, well, Dr. Hernandez.

19:43.238 --> 19:44.336
What a surprise.

19:44.361 --> 19:48.319
A surprise? Is it? You tagged
me in a taunting Instagram

19:48.481 --> 19:50.348
with the hashtag "Clinicfail,"

19:50.735 --> 19:54.500
# jodyhasmoregenerositythandrmary
hernandez.

19:55.226 --> 19:57.980
Real quick, hold on, that was me.

19:57.981 --> 20:00.403
I run the social media for
Schulman and Associates,

20:00.404 --> 20:03.282
so I apologize for... for tagging you.

20:03.283 --> 20:04.911
Look, Mary, I will admit that

20:04.912 --> 20:08.544
this mobile unit began
its mission out of spite,

20:08.545 --> 20:11.466
much like the space race
or a Taylor Swift video.

20:11.467 --> 20:13.429
Great, then you can just leave...

20:13.430 --> 20:14.723
But after helping all these women in need,

20:14.724 --> 20:16.267
something strange happened.

20:16.268 --> 20:18.062
I began to feel good about myself.

20:18.063 --> 20:20.317
- What?
- Yeah, I was as shocked as you.

20:20.318 --> 20:23.529
But yes, I enjoyed helping people for free!

20:24.092 --> 20:25.881
I'm sorry I was so dismissive.

20:25.906 --> 20:29.705
I've never seen him this
happy outside of Derby Day.

20:29.707 --> 20:30.658
Really?

20:31.711 --> 20:35.509
Well, I hate to admit it, but
having you here was a help.

20:35.510 --> 20:37.012
Well, then you wouldn't
mind if Morgan and I

20:37.013 --> 20:38.068
came back next week?

20:38.829 --> 20:41.933
Great, but maybe Morgan

20:42.173 --> 20:44.031
could not use our bathroom so much.

20:44.058 --> 20:46.050
- Ah, yeah.
- I'm sorry.

20:46.050 --> 20:47.970
I can't agree to that
at this moment in time.

20:47.971 --> 20:50.726
- He'll use it less.
- I won't use it less.

20:50.758 --> 20:52.531
I don't know. I don't know
how I'll feel next week.

20:52.556 --> 20:53.633
I'll make sure.

20:53.633 --> 20:55.513
Then I guess I'll see you next week.

20:55.538 --> 20:56.540
I look forward to it.

21:01.570 --> 21:05.251
Oh, oh, my gosh. Sparks!

21:08.381 --> 21:10.593
It's like frickin' aluminum
foil in the microwave.

21:16.639 --> 21:19.143
Well, I hope you can come visit me

21:19.144 --> 21:20.896
on Long Island sometime.

21:20.897 --> 21:23.484
We'll be there. Sometimes just me alone.

21:23.485 --> 21:25.572
That's not gonna work.
You know I'm married,

21:25.573 --> 21:27.242
and I have two kids.

21:27.243 --> 21:29.956
What? You're married? Where's your ring?

21:29.957 --> 21:31.293
I'm allergic to metal.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.592
You have a metal allergy? What a crock!

21:34.440 --> 21:37.153
What a waste of time! Ah, come on!

21:37.154 --> 21:39.001
Okay.

21:44.293 --> 21:46.548
Ah.

21:49.947 --> 21:50.847
Bye.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.887
Oh, remember what I told you:

21:54.888 --> 21:57.463
The government's coming for our guns!

21:58.934 --> 22:00.277
I love you too, Mom.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.176
Oh, wait. Still got it.

22:10.732 --> 22:13.802
Well, Beverly, looks
like even you are capable

22:13.836 --> 22:15.287
of being a good person sometimes.

22:16.110 --> 22:17.441
Aw, shut up.

22:19.530 --> 22:20.707
Thanks.
