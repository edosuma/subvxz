WEBVTT

00:02.916 --> 00:05.187
(upbeat instrumental
music plays)

00:07.191 --> 00:09.730
Yo, what's up? It's Lil Yachty,
from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:09.763 --> 00:13.303
Um, the thing what got me
into, you know,

00:13.336 --> 00:15.173
taking this rap thing
serious was,

00:15.207 --> 00:17.077
you know, growing up,
my mom worked two jobs,

00:17.111 --> 00:19.650
and wanted to, you know,
live above for once,

00:19.683 --> 00:21.620
you know, you know,
provide for my family,

00:21.654 --> 00:23.624
so I think
that's what really drove me

00:23.658 --> 00:26.229
to, you know,
take this thing serious.

00:27.398 --> 00:29.435
(trills) You already know
the vibes.

00:29.468 --> 00:31.272
Your boy Desiigner,
New York City.

00:31.306 --> 00:33.611
And what really made me take
my career serious was, you know,

00:33.644 --> 00:35.648
when I was 14, I got shot.

00:35.682 --> 00:38.320
For me, I was
in the streets, wilin',

00:38.353 --> 00:40.257
doing things
I wasn't supposed to do, so,

00:40.290 --> 00:42.629
seen a vision,
and I started following it,

00:42.662 --> 00:45.033
and here I am today. No kizzy.

00:47.371 --> 00:51.547
Hey. Lil Dicky. I'm from
Cheltenham, Pennsylvania,

00:51.580 --> 00:53.350
which is the first suburb
right outside of Philadelphia.

00:53.383 --> 00:55.120
It's, like,
a stone's throw away, honestly.

00:55.153 --> 00:56.724
Two minute drive,
you're in... in the city.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.763
My childhood was ideal.
Like, I was very loved

00:59.796 --> 01:01.767
and respected
by my friends and family...

01:01.800 --> 01:03.671
How's it look?
Does he look too Jewish?

01:03.704 --> 01:05.675
DAVE:
Well, maybe I shouldn't
say "ideal" actually.

01:05.708 --> 01:07.579
‐Think it's a little late
to be asking that.
‐GATA: Too Jewish?

01:07.612 --> 01:09.516
He don't even got the shit
on his head or nothing.

01:09.549 --> 01:12.221
There was a lot of body trauma,
if I'm being honest with you,

01:12.254 --> 01:14.225
a couple of procedures
I wish I could have back,

01:14.258 --> 01:16.396
a second crack at it,
but you live and you learn,

01:16.429 --> 01:18.300
um, as they say, and...

01:18.333 --> 01:20.605
Anyways, I went to college,
uh, University of Richmond,

01:20.638 --> 01:23.544
and I graduated as the
marketing student of the year.

01:23.577 --> 01:26.684
And actually, Businessweek
ranked my undergraduate program

01:26.717 --> 01:28.788
as the number‐one undergraduate
marketing program in America.

01:28.821 --> 01:30.424
So by the transitive property,

01:30.457 --> 01:32.127
I was incredibly
well‐positioned.

01:32.161 --> 01:34.198
And I got a job
at an ad agency.

01:34.231 --> 01:36.704
And it was cool.

01:36.737 --> 01:38.708
Like, uh, you know,
but it just, like...

01:38.741 --> 01:41.446
I've always felt like
I was the one, genuinely.

01:41.479 --> 01:44.251
So, I went for it,
and here I am.

01:44.285 --> 01:46.824
What was the question, again?

01:46.857 --> 01:48.828
You doing commercials?

01:48.861 --> 01:51.265
Yeah, I‐I have, like,
ten commercials on TV.

01:51.299 --> 01:53.504
Brrra. Geek geek!

01:53.537 --> 01:57.478
Yeah. Can we actually, uh,
not put that part in the edit?

01:57.512 --> 01:59.516
Um, who do I need
to talk to about that?

01:59.549 --> 02:01.252
Uh, I'd actually love to...

02:01.285 --> 02:02.622
Just because I'm very,
like, careful

02:02.656 --> 02:04.425
about how
I do my branding and...

02:04.458 --> 02:06.830
Oh, that's great.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.947
‐Uh...
‐Uh...

02:31.980 --> 02:33.684
You could interpret it that way.

‐TD Ameritrade?
‐Mm‐hmm.

02:46.543 --> 02:48.614
Sure.
Let me pull up my list.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.593
Okay, so I've got one idea.

02:54.626 --> 02:56.797
‐Just one?
‐It's the best idea

02:56.830 --> 02:58.801
probably that's ever
come out of this building, so...

02:58.834 --> 03:00.505
‐Okay, let's hear it.
‐Would you be interested
in hearing

03:00.538 --> 03:01.974
‐an idea like that?
‐I would love to hear your idea.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.577
Great. Imagine driving
down the street, right?

03:03.611 --> 03:04.913
You look up,
you see a billboard.

03:04.946 --> 03:07.451
But there's a human being
strapped to it.

03:07.484 --> 03:10.257
Like, actually up, strapped.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.495
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐And it just says.
"Strapped for cash?

03:12.529 --> 03:14.499
‐TD Ameritrade."
‐Mm‐hmm.

03:14.533 --> 03:16.269
It's clean, it's simple,
it's newsworthy.

03:16.302 --> 03:18.273
I think, like,
reporters would report.

03:18.306 --> 03:20.277
It's an online brokerage firm.

03:20.310 --> 03:21.880
They're not buying
anything funny.

03:21.914 --> 03:23.416
I don't know.
I chose not

03:23.450 --> 03:24.953
to have any inhibitions
and dream big.

03:24.986 --> 03:27.692
Like, I'm not putting any
unnecessary limitations on this.

03:27.726 --> 03:30.498
The limitations are necessary,
or you're just wasting time.

03:30.531 --> 03:32.635
‐Okay, number two on the list.
‐Mm‐hmm.

03:32.669 --> 03:36.510
If you were to hear me say,
"I'm dick‐fingering a girl,"

03:36.543 --> 03:39.415
in a song,
how would you interpret that?

03:39.448 --> 03:41.887
‐That you're a loser?
‐'Cause every song's about sex.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.958
‐I've never heard
such unique phrasing.
‐Yeah, but no guy

03:43.991 --> 03:45.661
has ever said,
"I want to dick‐finger you."

03:45.695 --> 03:47.264
Bingo. Exactly.
Why would...

03:47.297 --> 03:49.001
That's‐that's first mover
advantage. Oh!

03:49.034 --> 03:50.772
I figured out my rap name.

03:50.805 --> 03:52.609
Oh, my God, what is it?

03:52.642 --> 03:54.445
Well, take a moment
and really absorb this,

03:54.478 --> 03:55.815
because you're probably
gonna, like,

03:55.848 --> 03:57.418
replay this moment
a couple dozen times.

03:57.451 --> 04:00.357
‐Tell me.
‐Call me...

04:00.390 --> 04:03.263
Norm Bender.

04:03.296 --> 04:06.002
Norm... Bender?

04:06.035 --> 04:08.039
Yeah, like, my...
as if my name were Norman.

04:08.072 --> 04:10.477
‐MAN: Yo, Burd.
‐'Cause I bend norms at every...

04:10.511 --> 04:11.814
‐Burd.
‐I'm Norm Bender.

04:11.847 --> 04:13.450
Yo, here, here. Look.

04:13.483 --> 04:15.888
‐You done Chatroulette yet?
‐Oh, yeah. Huh.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.458
‐I think I've seen this before.
‐Is this‐is this...

04:17.492 --> 04:18.961
‐This is a global...
‐Yeah. You, like, connect

04:18.994 --> 04:20.765
with a bunch of different
people all over the world.

04:20.798 --> 04:22.535
‐It's, uh...
‐Oh I... Ew.
‐Oh, wow.

04:22.569 --> 04:24.706
‐Uh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah.
‐Guy's dick is made of meat.

04:24.739 --> 04:26.042
‐There's a lot of dicks on this.
‐Hey, what do you need from us?

04:26.075 --> 04:27.612
‐Let's cream. Uh...
‐Hold on. Hold on.

04:27.645 --> 04:28.647
‐Uh, here we go. Here we go.
‐Lower my voice.

04:28.681 --> 04:29.716
Well, they keep nexting us,

04:29.749 --> 04:31.486
but I'm ready to make him cream.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.524
‐Mm. Yup.
‐Oh.

04:33.557 --> 04:34.693
‐Hello, sir.
‐Oh, hi.

04:34.726 --> 04:36.497
Hey, how's it going?

04:36.530 --> 04:39.301
DAVE:
Just hanging... out.

04:39.335 --> 04:42.742
Are you... my father?

04:42.775 --> 04:44.880
‐MAN: Um... I don't think so.
‐(laughter)

04:44.913 --> 04:47.351
‐Nice.
‐Ah.

04:47.384 --> 04:48.521
‐MAN: Okay.
‐DAVE: That's funny.
‐Hey, chubby.

04:48.554 --> 04:49.990
MAN:
Just working from home.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.292
‐Looking for people to talk to.
‐EMMA: Shit. Jeff.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.029
(clears throat)

04:53.062 --> 04:55.568
DAVE:
So we should work hard
at this task.

04:55.601 --> 04:57.672
‐Did he see us?
‐Mm, I don't know.

04:57.705 --> 04:59.341
‐It's fine.
‐I don't know. I'm not...

04:59.375 --> 05:00.645
Guys, I've done coke
with one of the partners

05:00.678 --> 05:01.880
at the holiday party.

05:01.914 --> 05:03.784
I'm not gonna say who, but

05:03.818 --> 05:06.088
‐trust me, we're good. It's...
‐I've never done coke, but...

05:06.122 --> 05:08.928
‐I'm on Adderall.
‐Ah, nice. Can I get some?

05:08.961 --> 05:10.965
Can't do it. My mom made me
promise not to give any away.

05:10.998 --> 05:12.535
Got it.
Got it, got it, got it.

05:13.537 --> 05:14.940
‐Dave.
‐Of course.

05:14.973 --> 05:16.543
What about "of course"?

05:16.577 --> 05:18.681
"TD Ameritrade. Of course."

05:18.714 --> 05:20.852
‐Of course not.
‐Well...

05:20.885 --> 05:22.589
Maybe just think
of it differently.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.091
Like, what kind of movies
do you like?

05:24.124 --> 05:27.765
Uh, Warner Brothers?
They're the most consistent.

05:27.799 --> 05:31.807
‐Never mind.
‐(phone dings)

05:31.840 --> 05:35.982
Wow! Kanye's new album
just dropped. Yeezus is here.

05:36.015 --> 05:37.752
‐Yeezus is here?
‐Yeah, isn't that the best title

05:37.785 --> 05:40.023
you've ever heard? That's such
a Kanye title. I love it.

05:40.056 --> 05:42.461
‐Yeezus.
‐So arrogant
and lacking self‐awareness.

05:42.495 --> 05:43.964
Very Kanye.

05:43.998 --> 05:45.601
What on God's green earth

05:45.635 --> 05:47.004
‐are you even talking about?
‐(laughs)

05:47.037 --> 05:48.439
If Kanye wasn't that way,
he would never be Kanye.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.809
He wouldn't even be a rapper.

05:49.843 --> 05:51.078
This is gonna hit me
at the perfect time.

05:51.112 --> 05:52.815
Every time I listen to him,
it's like

05:52.849 --> 05:54.418
there's nothing in my way
and I can achieve all my dreams.

05:54.451 --> 05:57.424
Aw.
Is the world in your way?

05:57.457 --> 05:59.028
You got to understand
I have always felt

05:59.061 --> 06:01.700
like I was the biggest star
on the planet.

06:01.733 --> 06:03.971
‐You?
‐Yeah, me. I used to watch
The Truman Show

06:04.004 --> 06:06.409
and think that that was me‐‐
that everyone was watching me

06:06.442 --> 06:07.745
because I was, like, destined

06:07.779 --> 06:09.583
to provide entertainment
for everybody.

06:09.616 --> 06:11.452
And I still feel that way,
and I'm gonna go for it fully.

06:11.485 --> 06:13.724
I'm just waiting on the moment
for my boat to hit the wall,

06:13.757 --> 06:15.060
like Jim Carey's did at the end
of the movie?

06:15.093 --> 06:16.697
So you've always
been delusional?

06:16.730 --> 06:18.701
‐Or I've always said
‐Or...

06:18.734 --> 06:21.974
that I can live with failure,
but I can't live with what‐ifs.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.577
It must be nice
to live in a world

06:23.611 --> 06:25.581
where dreams
don't have to be dreams.

06:25.615 --> 06:27.652
Guys, seriously?
How am I still here right now

06:27.685 --> 06:29.656
and you're playing
fucking basketball?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.192
EMMA:
Sorry, Stephen.
We're so sorry.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.729
Our bad, big dog.

06:32.762 --> 06:34.499
‐(scoffs)
‐That's... Mm.

06:34.532 --> 06:36.637
Did you just
call our boss big dog?

06:36.670 --> 06:38.641
I did, but it doesn't
really matter.

06:38.674 --> 06:40.645
In five years, he's gonna
be remembering the time

06:40.678 --> 06:42.649
he had this conversation with me
when I was wasting

06:42.682 --> 06:45.588
my national treasure of a brain
on TD Ameritrade.

06:45.621 --> 06:47.057
This fucking sucks.
This must be exactly

06:47.090 --> 06:48.761
what Kanye felt like
when he worked at the Gap.

06:53.236 --> 06:54.673
I've hit a wall.
I got to g

06:54.706 --> 06:56.208
You want to head out?

06:56.242 --> 06:58.146
I think I got a little bit more
left in me,

06:58.179 --> 07:01.085
so I'm just gonna stick around,
but I'll see you tomorrow.

07:01.118 --> 07:02.755
All right.
Good night, Slug.

about this cypher.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.793
LD, you just made
the XXL Freshman list.

08:11.827 --> 08:13.597
You used to dream about
that type of shit.

08:13.630 --> 08:15.568

Ain't nobody spittin' like you.

08:15.601 --> 08:17.104

08:17.137 --> 08:19.709
You can get a haircut
if that's... Does that help?

of that puzzle,

09:28.212 --> 09:29.916

12:16.883 --> 12:18.319

such a presence to him.

13:08.052 --> 13:10.456
Well, that's what happens
when you own an ad agency.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.563
Ooh, let me check Adrian's
office and see what they're

13:13.597 --> 13:15.834
‐pitching. ‐Why do you care
so much about this?

13:15.868 --> 13:17.938
‐It's like trash digging or...
‐Because making commercials is

13:17.972 --> 13:19.976
so much cooler
than dumb‐ass billboards.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.314
I've been waiting
over a year to make TV spots.

13:22.347 --> 13:23.884
So if you could do
whatever you want in life,

13:23.917 --> 13:25.554
you would, what,
make Super Bowl commercials?

13:25.587 --> 13:27.424
If I could do anything,
I'd direct movies.

13:27.457 --> 13:30.363
What? How have I never
heard this before?

13:30.396 --> 13:32.133
Just don't feel like
it's a real job.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.436
What do you mean?
It's definitely a real job.

13:33.469 --> 13:34.471
Every movie you see
has a director.

13:34.505 --> 13:36.342
I understand how it works, Dave.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.379
It's just 99% of directors
don't make it.

13:38.412 --> 13:40.383
Yeah, but what if
you're the one...

13:40.416 --> 13:42.220
‐Can you just help me?
‐Don't be such a buzzkill.

13:42.253 --> 13:43.957
This is, like,
a rebellious brand, you know.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.594
You got to, like,
unleash me here.

13:45.627 --> 13:48.299
You'd be surprised what they're
probably capable of doing.

13:48.332 --> 13:49.869

to unleash my inner Kanye

13:49.902 --> 13:51.840

13:51.873 --> 13:54.411
Okay.

13:55.413 --> 13:57.250
Okay.

13:57.283 --> 13:59.555
What?

13:59.589 --> 14:02.060
So I'd be rapping,
rapping, rapping.

14:02.093 --> 14:04.899
Swagger, charisma,
all of that, hopefully.

14:04.932 --> 14:07.505

over and over

14:07.538 --> 14:09.474
until the song is done.
I don't know.

14:09.509 --> 14:11.211
But don't think all these people
will have to, like,

14:11.245 --> 14:13.015
turn their heads to see you?

14:13.049 --> 14:14.351
I didn't think about that.

14:14.384 --> 14:16.088
I think
you should go under the table.

14:16.121 --> 14:18.225
It'll be so sick.
Come through here.

14:18.259 --> 14:20.964
‐Like, crawl?
‐Yeah, and then, like, rap here,

14:20.998 --> 14:23.637
rap here, and then you'll be
in the middle performing.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.440
‐Crawl.
‐You want me to crawl under
the table in front of Jeff?

14:25.473 --> 14:28.112
Yeah. Look, here. I'll show you
'cause you can't see.

14:28.145 --> 14:30.383
I'm rapping. I'm rapping.
You have no idea what I'm doing.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.420
‐And I shoot through the table

‐Yeah.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.157
‐And down.
‐And I'm up here,
and then there.

14:34.191 --> 14:35.594
Wow. And then I'm here, and then
everyone's staring at me.

14:35.627 --> 14:37.498
‐Then head over here.
‐Yeah. Then I could even,

14:37.531 --> 14:40.103
‐uh, high‐five people
if I wanted to.
‐(laughing): Yes.

14:40.136 --> 14:41.673

‐Yes. Cut.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.375

14:43.409 --> 14:45.046
Oh, that's way sicker.

14:45.079 --> 14:46.616
‐Right?
‐Yeah, I like that a lot.

14:46.649 --> 14:50.456
And then I'll design
some awesome graphics on the TV.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.293
‐Slug?
‐Yeah.

14:52.327 --> 14:54.264
Will you direct my real
music videos when I make them

14:54.297 --> 14:55.366
when I'm a real rapper?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.203
Definitely, Slug.

14:57.237 --> 14:59.274
Hey, but don't get too ex...
Oh, you're giving me a hug?

14:59.307 --> 15:00.443
‐Yeah.
‐Aw.

15:00.476 --> 15:02.447
Don't get too excited, okay?

15:02.480 --> 15:04.084
It's gonna be an all‐nighter.
So write your rap

15:04.117 --> 15:05.319
and I'll work on the visuals.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.076
Fuck. They got strip clubs
out there.

15:17.110 --> 15:19.247
‐Yup.
‐Got one night to write a rap.

15:19.281 --> 15:22.287
‐That's fine. I thrive
in the face of pressure.
‐Yeah.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.324
I better drink some fucking
Mountain Dew if I'm gonna...

15:24.357 --> 15:26.061
‐Caffeinated. Go for it.
‐The...

15:26.095 --> 15:27.665
‐Oh, my God!

15:27.698 --> 15:30.236

15:30.269 --> 15:32.675
‐Are you okay?
‐Yeah, I'm fine.
Please, I can't be touched.

15:37.283 --> 15:38.653
MIKE:
Hey, Sherry, just following up
to s

15:38.687 --> 15:40.524

15:48.372 --> 15:50.343
That might be, like, a past
type of way of thinking.

15:50.376 --> 15:53.082
You know, like, shouldn't we be,
like, uplifting everyone

15:53.115 --> 15:55.419
and celebrating this talent
and showcase it,

15:55.453 --> 15:57.958
not pitting everyone,
uh, at odds?

15:57.992 --> 16:02.267

social, uh, ongoings

16:07.511 --> 16:09.381

That's cool,

16:18.700 --> 16:21.038

have any unreleased verses,
