Go ahead, order anything
you want-- it's on the house.

00:02.709 --> 00:04.875
Because you are the house.

00:04.959 --> 00:06.375
That's right,
I'm the house, baby.

00:06.458 --> 00:07.583
Look at us.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.875
Yeah, it's been two months,

00:08.959 --> 00:10.417
and you still get
a kick out of me.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.333
We'll see how I'm
feeling at three.

00:12.417 --> 00:14.083

00:19.959 --> 00:21.000
Yes, son?

00:21.083 --> 00:22.250
Ooh, nice jacket.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.000
Dressin' for successin'.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.959

00:26.959 --> 00:28.792
I don't have it.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.625
Anyway, we need to talk
about birthday party.

00:30.709 --> 00:32.166
(gasps)
Oh, Gerald.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.875
I had no idea.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.875
How old are you turning?
Wait, no, no, no, no.

00:35.959 --> 00:37.125
Don't tell me.
I'm great at this.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.125
Uh...

00:38.208 --> 00:39.542
(laughs)

00:40.625 --> 00:41.834
Ooh.

00:41.917 --> 00:42.959
Taking a while.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.917
Forget it.
You know what?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.458
Your unusual man-boy quality
is making it impossible.

00:47.542 --> 00:48.709
I know, right?
Look it.

00:48.792 --> 00:49.792
He-he's got a baby face,

00:49.875 --> 00:51.458
yet a 5:00 shadow.
Mm-hmm.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.208
That's it.

00:53.291 --> 00:54.917
Oh!

00:55.000 --> 00:56.917
Yeah, but it's
actually not my birthday.

00:57.000 --> 00:57.959
It's my dad's.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.458
On Saturday,
he's turning...

00:59.542 --> 01:00.583
50, 50.
(gasps)

01:00.667 --> 01:02.250
Guilty. Big five-O.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.458
It's a big one.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.250
Hello?

01:09.333 --> 01:11.667
Oh, wait, it's the woman
Olivia Pope is based off of.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.125
Excuse me, I have to take it.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.750
Hi, Judy.
How can I help?

01:15.834 --> 01:16.917
I'm confused.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.458
Oh, that's Kerry Washington's

01:18.542 --> 01:19.917
character on<i> Scandal. </i>

01:20.000 --> 01:21.375
Yeah, thank you.
Uh, no.

01:21.458 --> 01:22.917
Aren't you turning 51?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.500
You know who's 50?
Robert Downey Jr.

01:24.583 --> 01:25.959
And he pulls the "Jr." off
like it's nothing.

01:26.041 --> 01:26.959
You know who's 51?

01:27.041 --> 01:28.500
The guy who voices Gollum,

01:28.583 --> 01:30.333
Wanda Sykes,

01:30.417 --> 01:31.709
Bernie Sanders.

01:31.792 --> 01:32.959
I'm just getting
used to being 50.

01:33.041 --> 01:33.959
I'm not ready to be fifty...

01:34.041 --> 01:35.166
Babe?
What, babe?

01:35.250 --> 01:36.750
I am throwing you

01:36.834 --> 01:38.834
a 50th birthday party
to end all parties.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.166
No.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.750
I'll come back to plan,

01:41.834 --> 01:43.625
but first I got to go
meet Jada for sushi.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.083
Okay. Mm!

01:45.166 --> 01:46.959
Bye, Gerald.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.417
Jada Pinkett Smith.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.917
Do all fancy black women
know each other?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.583
You two are right on the line
right about now.

01:53.667 --> 01:54.959
How long have you
been sitting there?

01:55.041 --> 01:56.333
Long enough
to hear you're having

01:56.417 --> 01:57.959
a 50th birthday party,
which confused me,

01:58.041 --> 01:59.750
because didn't we
do that a year ago?

01:59.834 --> 02:01.208
But you didn't
know me back then,

02:01.291 --> 02:02.500
so now I get to go.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.375
Yeah.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.000
do it without
that hairy donut on your face.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.667
Oh, come on, that goatee
looked good and you know it.

02:07.750 --> 02:08.750
Yeah, it did.

02:08.834 --> 02:10.083

last year was a hot mess.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.375

to celebrate me--

03:29.458 --> 03:31.041
and I understand the draw--

03:31.125 --> 03:33.083
then a nice family dinner
would hit the spot.

Shotgun, dessert!

Well, I know Florida's not right
around the corner,

maybe we should invite your dad?

That's not necessary.
He's a busy man.

to come all the way out here

03:46.500 --> 03:49.041

03:50.792 --> 03:53.083

for my big birthday party.

I always just imagined he
hatched from a leather egg.

ever gonna be a dad,

16:43.041 --> 16:43.959
(crashing, clattering)

16:44.041 --> 16:45.041
SARA:
Damn it!

16:47.000 --> 16:49.041
What the hell's
going on out here?

16:49.125 --> 16:52.291
So, these didn't turn out
exactly as I had hoped.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.875
But I think if you scrape
off the burnt top layer

16:54.959 --> 16:56.917
and don't eat the
uncooked bottom layer,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.125
that the middle
is... decent.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.667
(scoffs)
It's okay.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.709
We have plenty of desserts
in the fridge. Ravi...

17:02.792 --> 17:04.500
No! No, no, no!
It's not about the dessert,

17:04.583 --> 17:05.917
it's about what the
dessert represents.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.792
Beneath the caramel shell,

17:07.875 --> 17:09.458
there are lots
and lots of layers.

17:09.542 --> 17:10.917
It was supposed
to be a metaphor.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.792
And an apology.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.583
For what?

17:16.542 --> 17:18.000
For telling Gerald
not to find you.

17:19.375 --> 17:22.208
I told him that you
were empty inside.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.709
And that beneath your shell,
there was nothing.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.166
But I was wrong.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.125
Beneath your shell,
you are full of

17:28.208 --> 17:31.250
a surprisingly
rich, creamy,

17:31.333 --> 17:33.959
custard, and we're all
better for having eaten it.

17:34.041 --> 17:35.709
Oh! This is getting
away from me.

17:35.792 --> 17:37.417
(sighs)

17:37.500 --> 17:39.583
What I'm trying
to say is...

17:39.667 --> 17:41.250
I'm sorry.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.041
I'm sorry I kept the two of you
apart for so long.

17:50.375 --> 17:54.959
So... these
crème brûlées... are me?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.959
They were supposed to be.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.000
(whispers):
Thank you.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.083
(Sara laughs)

18:11.041 --> 18:13.500
I'm gonna...
pump the brakes.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.875
I think this is gonna
taste really good,

18:15.959 --> 18:19.458
you know, once,
uh... once I cut...

18:19.542 --> 18:20.917
through.

18:22.208 --> 18:25.000
Hey, some Russian model
is asking after you?

18:25.083 --> 18:28.250
Nastasia or Nastaya
or Nastenka?

18:28.333 --> 18:29.917
That doesn't really help--
I know a Nastasia,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.208
a Nastaya and a Nastenka.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.333
(groans)

18:34.417 --> 18:36.291
I think my life is empty.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.125
Think my dad's right.

18:38.208 --> 18:41.625
Jimmy... look, it doesn't
matter what your dad thinks.

18:41.709 --> 18:43.000
And it doesn't matter
what I think.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.792
It only matters
what you think.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.208
But why-why don't you just
tell me what you think,

18:46.291 --> 18:47.834
to guide
what I should think.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.041
I think you should
shave that goatee.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.583
Just because you can
pull it off,

18:50.667 --> 18:52.083
doesn't mean you should.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.917

Gluten. Tons of gluten.

19:59.542 --> 20:01.000
It's basically nothing
but gluten.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.792
Hi.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.583
Uh, my name's Gerald.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.959
I have... something pretty
important to tell you.

20:11.291 --> 20:12.959
Hey, Dad...

20:13.041 --> 20:14.875
uh, I got something pretty
important to tell you.

20:14.959 --> 20:15.959
Oh, yeah? What?

20:17.208 --> 20:19.041
(laughing)

20:19.125 --> 20:20.625
Wanted you to be
the first to know

20:20.709 --> 20:22.083
that I'm gonna
propose to Vanessa.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.834
You are?

20:23.917 --> 20:26.125
And I know that
it's fast and I...

20:26.208 --> 20:27.500
I know you think
it's probably...

20:27.583 --> 20:28.667
It doesn't matter what I think.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.041
It matters what you think.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.125
Can you at least
tell me what you think

20:32.208 --> 20:34.208
to sort of guide me
on what to think?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.000
I think it's incredible.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.000
Congratulations.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.542

20:39.625 --> 20:41.083

My dad died.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.250
What?

21:04.125 --> 21:05.166
Hey, guys, great news!

21:05.250 --> 21:06.959
If you chip off the ash,

21:07.041 --> 21:09.250
the crème brûlée's
really not half bad.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.458
(laughing): Geez, who died?
