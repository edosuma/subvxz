Honey, I-I-I’m sorry,
I just can’t.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.875
Well, I can give you
one of my pills.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.500
No, dear, it’s the necklace.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.500

17:41.500 --> 17:44.375

17:44.375 --> 17:46.750
You just have to get used to it.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.250
Heck, I knew guys in ’Nam

17:49.250 --> 17:52.709
had necklaces, some of them
eight or nine ears on them,

17:52.709 --> 17:54.375
and they were fine.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.458
I’ve given this
a lot of thought...

17:57.458 --> 17:59.667
-Mm-hmm.
-And I think GiGi

17:59.667 --> 18:01.875
belongs with you.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.500
I mean, family was
everything to her,

18:14.542 --> 18:16.083
Here,
let me put it on you, honey.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.291
-Yeah.
-It’s really beautiful.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.083
Oh, wow,

18:20.083 --> 18:22.417
I feel so connected to her.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.875
(gasping)
That’s pretty.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.250
It’s not a blood diamond, is it?

18:27.250 --> 18:28.750
Not really, no.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.417
It’s a diamond

18:30.417 --> 18:32.542
that Mom-Mom had made

18:32.542 --> 18:35.500
out of your great-grandmother.

No, she said she was
probably in heaven.
