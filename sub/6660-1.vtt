<i>Selina: And, uh, who
else is confirmed?</i>

00:20.285 --> 00:22.386
<i>Is senator Dorsey confirmed?</i>

00:22.387 --> 00:23.720
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:23.721 --> 00:25.356
And senator Lucas was a maybe,

00:25.357 --> 00:27.226
but now he's definitely
a definitely.

00:27.227 --> 00:29.862
- Oh, that's awfully nice.
- Yeah, it's growing as we speak.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.898
Yeah, okay, let's go
talk filibuster reform.

00:31.899 --> 00:35.501
No, the Vice President does not have a
sliver of daylight in her schedule today.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.503
- Bye, Sue. Hey, Mike, Mike.
- Yeah?

00:37.504 --> 00:39.972
Are we pushing the whole
Cornstarch Utensils campaign now?

00:39.973 --> 00:41.641
Yes, ma'am.
We've got a whole online thing.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.177
- The inter-nerds are on it.
- Okay, good.

00:43.178 --> 00:45.512
And today with the senators,
don't forget to smile.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.781
Yeah, is that a poppy seed
there in your teeth?

00:47.782 --> 00:50.383
- Oh, probably.
- Yeah, ugh.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.651
- Oh!
- What?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.986
- Senator Bixby is coming.
- Oh, good.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.855
- Great.
- Ma'am, this is a fork.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.324
- And you know that he's our tour guide.
- He's the tour guide.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.759
- Right, yes, yes, yes.
- Remember?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.428
This is the new
Cornstarch fork, ma'am.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.331
I got the Cornstarch
spoon, too.

01:03.332 --> 01:04.932
Could we maybe table
tableware for now, Gary,

01:04.933 --> 01:07.568
- and focus on filibuster reform?
- No, no, no, but, Amy, look.

01:07.569 --> 01:09.770
Look at this.
This is classic clean jobs stuff.

01:09.771 --> 01:11.772
I mean, if I can get
Cornstarch Utensils

01:11.773 --> 01:13.507
in most federal buildings
by the fall,

01:13.508 --> 01:15.709
well, then the VEEP has landed.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.344
That is what we are
working on, landing you.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.714
- Yeah.
- Like a big, beautiful eagle.

01:19.715 --> 01:22.316
( Sirens blaring )

01:22.317 --> 01:24.085
- You want your scarf?
- No.

01:24.086 --> 01:25.452
- Are you sure? It looks really pretty...
- No, I don't want it.

01:25.453 --> 01:28.622
And what about senator Reeves?
Is he dead yet?

01:28.623 --> 01:31.091
Not yet.
He's mostly intravenous.

01:31.092 --> 01:34.160
He has so many tubes in him, he
looks like a set of bagpipes.

01:34.161 --> 01:37.297
( Sirens blaring )

01:37.298 --> 01:39.032
- Let me take your coat.
- Want to take your coats?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.736
- Here's your glasses.
- What do you think?

01:41.737 --> 01:44.171
Glasses on for
the intellectual look?

01:44.172 --> 01:46.675
- Focused?
- A woman with vision.

01:46.676 --> 01:49.178
- I like your glasses.
- No, glasses make me look weak.

01:49.179 --> 01:52.448
- Yeah, I agree.
- It's like a wheelchair for the eye.

01:52.449 --> 01:55.651
Okay, senators,
let the reforming commence.

01:55.652 --> 01:57.854
- Amy: We're expecting 50 or 60.
- Oh, good.

02:00.491 --> 02:03.861
Is this the right room?
Are we early?

02:03.862 --> 02:06.097
- Senator Phil Dorsey, 2:00.
- I'm not a sniper.

02:06.098 --> 02:08.866
- Philip.
- Ah, Madam Vice President. Welcome.

02:08.866 --> 02:11.341
Thank you. Oh, you remember
my chief of staff Amy.

02:11.342 --> 02:12.607
Oh, Amy.
It's nice to see you.

02:12.608 --> 02:14.172
His daughter Emily
just graduated from Harvard.

02:14.173 --> 02:16.909
- Tell me, how is Emily?
- Oh, she's good.

02:16.910 --> 02:18.911
- Oh, good.
- Can I get you something to drink?

02:18.912 --> 02:20.779
- I would love a coffee.
- You've got it.

02:20.780 --> 02:23.482
Okay, thank you.
What's going on, Amy?

02:23.483 --> 02:25.651
There aren't enough people to
fill a fucking canoe in here.

02:25.652 --> 02:29.055
- Okay.
- What's wrong? That was your bad okay.

02:29.056 --> 02:32.459
What's wrong? Senator Mike Dudley.
He's interested in maps.

02:32.460 --> 02:35.562
- Mike, you found us.
- Oh, Madam Vice President.

02:35.563 --> 02:37.964
- Is that a map joke?
- Yes, it is.

02:37.965 --> 02:39.933
- ( Phone ringing )
- Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

02:39.934 --> 02:42.035
- Okay.
- Let's talk about this blog thing.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.970
- Guys, what's going on right now?
- I can explain that.

02:43.971 --> 02:45.472
What is happening right now?

02:45.473 --> 02:47.707
Brett Kagan's blog
picked up a tweet from us.

02:47.708 --> 02:49.776
Quote, "76% of
government buildings

02:49.777 --> 02:52.779
now have Cornstarch Utensils!
Let's make it 100!

02:52.780 --> 02:54.847
Let's make plastic
utensils extinct!"

02:54.848 --> 02:57.917
Oh, great, we've upset
the plastics industry.

02:57.918 --> 03:00.653
This whole building is
bankrolled by plastics.

03:00.654 --> 03:02.889
<i>- This is why nobody showed up.
- Man: Madam Vice President.</i>

03:02.890 --> 03:05.458
- I don't know who this man is.
- Hello.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.094
Mike, talk to me.
I am in a room

03:07.095 --> 03:09.263
with three people
and a fuckload of quiche.

03:09.264 --> 03:10.664
Okay, here comes Dorsey
with your coffee.

03:10.665 --> 03:13.034
Gary, I have large,
moving shapes covered.

03:13.035 --> 03:14.502
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

03:14.503 --> 03:17.739
- ( Whispers ) Here's your coffee.
- Oh, my co...

03:17.740 --> 03:20.108
I'll get it.
I got it. I got it.

03:20.109 --> 03:21.943
Okay, here's what we do.
Here's what we do.

03:21.944 --> 03:23.545
You should meet
with senator Hallowes.

03:23.546 --> 03:26.180
She is stight with
the plastics people, it's...

03:26.181 --> 03:28.215
Are you kidding?

03:28.216 --> 03:30.484
Do these not bend
the fuck back?

03:30.485 --> 03:32.452
No. No.

03:32.453 --> 03:33.587
What am I supposed
to do with this?

03:33.588 --> 03:35.188
I'm supposed to eat
around corners?

03:35.189 --> 03:37.324
Is that how's gonna work?
Here, take this, please.

03:37.325 --> 03:40.795
We could even give Hallowes a post
on your clean jobs commission,

03:40.796 --> 03:42.830
- keep plastics happy.
- That's actually a great idea.

03:42.831 --> 03:45.733
Can you do that? Can you do that?
Can you get Hallowes now?

03:45.734 --> 03:48.003
Of course I can.
You can just shut it down.

03:48.004 --> 03:49.805
- Yeah. Go, go, go.
- Shut it down.

03:49.806 --> 03:51.808
- You should mingle.
- Mingle?

03:51.809 --> 03:53.276
- Yeah.
- What?

03:53.277 --> 03:55.545
How do you suggest that I
mingle with this few people?

03:55.546 --> 03:58.648
Did Simon mingle with Garfunkel?

03:58.649 --> 04:01.084
Well, they work together.
They probably socialized together.

04:01.085 --> 04:02.553
I'm sure they did, right?

04:02.554 --> 04:05.489
Madam Vice President.
Hi, I'm Dan Egan.

04:05.490 --> 04:07.291
I'm director of communications
for senator Hallowes.

04:07.292 --> 04:08.759
- Oh, good.
- Currently.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.628
I just want to say
that I'm a huge fan

04:10.629 --> 04:12.363
- of the clean jobs initiative.
- Oh, thank you.

04:12.364 --> 04:14.932
Well, you know what I say, it's a
dirty job and I love to do it.

04:14.933 --> 04:17.034
- Ha, that's funny. I actually...
- Barbara?

04:17.035 --> 04:20.071
- Selina, hi.
- Hi.

04:20.072 --> 04:22.940
The Vice President, or VEEP, has
managed to punch her way through...

04:22.941 --> 04:24.741
Thank you, Dan.
Yeah.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.476
Barbara, it's so good
to see you.

04:26.477 --> 04:28.778
- It's good to see you.
- What have I been missing here?

04:28.779 --> 04:31.581
Power.
I'm kidding!

04:31.582 --> 04:34.150
- Oh, Selina.
- I know. I know.

04:34.151 --> 04:35.985
Coffee for the Vice President,
please, Dan.

04:35.986 --> 04:38.087
Guess what? I've managed
to get a fresh batch

04:38.088 --> 04:39.756
of those European sweeners
you like so much.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.458
Oh, thanks, Gary.
Yeah, they're great sweeteners.

04:42.459 --> 04:44.627
- They are awful.
- ( Laughs )

04:44.628 --> 04:48.832
Actually, they're just sweeteners I
got at a NATO meeting last year.

04:48.833 --> 04:52.469
They really taste rather...

04:53.638 --> 04:57.008
Uh, unpleasant.

04:57.009 --> 04:58.276
Kind of bitter.

04:58.277 --> 05:01.312
So, Dan, are you enjoying
working for Hallowes?

05:01.313 --> 05:03.915
Not really.
She's middle of the road.

05:03.916 --> 05:07.118
She's mediocre, really.
Of all the -ocres, she's the mediest.

05:07.119 --> 05:10.222
Do I add water to this machine?
It's like a bot.

05:10.223 --> 05:13.326
It's a nice bag, Gary.

05:13.327 --> 05:15.294
You know, he calls that
"The Leviathan."

05:15.295 --> 05:17.764
Ooh, you got the nuclear
codes in there, buddy?

05:17.765 --> 05:20.566
Is there a pouch or something
that I put into this?

05:20.567 --> 05:23.570
You still got that guy Mike
in your press shop?

05:23.571 --> 05:25.506
- Yes.
- He ran press for Moses, didn't he?

05:25.507 --> 05:28.175
- Oh, God.
- Is there like an espresso thing?

05:28.176 --> 05:30.845
- A little podule or anything?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

05:30.846 --> 05:33.115
All right, look, watch me, autismo.
You take the little pod,

05:33.116 --> 05:35.284
put the little pod in the fucking
hole, shut the fucking lid,

05:35.285 --> 05:37.352
hit the fucking button
for two fucking seconds.

05:37.353 --> 05:39.954
- Oh, it's so easy.
- Too quick, I didn't see it.

05:39.955 --> 05:42.524
Yeah, well, next time pack an espresso
machine in your big fuckin' bitch bag.

05:42.525 --> 05:44.525
- Oh, my God.
- Dan seems nice.

05:44.526 --> 05:46.193
- He's new.
- Oh, he is great.

05:46.194 --> 05:48.996
Very loyal. I got him from
an Ohio congresswoman.

05:48.997 --> 05:51.631
You know, he's dating
my daughter.

05:51.632 --> 05:53.967
- You're kidding. Janet?
- No.

05:53.968 --> 05:56.202
Of course not.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

05:56.203 --> 05:58.738
I meant, um, Carol.

05:58.739 --> 06:00.406
- Carol.
- ( Chuckles )

06:00.407 --> 06:03.575
- How are your kids?
- Uh, she's good.

06:04.978 --> 06:07.146
<i>- I understand you're busy.
- I am.</i>

06:07.147 --> 06:09.948
But I wanted
to talk to you about

06:09.949 --> 06:12.351
coming on board
the clean jobs commission.

06:12.352 --> 06:14.354
To get plastics off your back?

06:14.355 --> 06:16.289
No, sorry, Selina.
That would be bad for me.

06:16.290 --> 06:20.660
Oh, come on. They're not gonna
pull funding over this.

06:20.661 --> 06:22.528
Honey, what is
plastics made of?

06:22.529 --> 06:24.664
You piss off plastics,
you piss off oil.

06:24.665 --> 06:25.965
And you do not want
to fuck with those guys

06:25.966 --> 06:28.968
because they fuck in
a very unpleasant fashion.

06:28.969 --> 06:32.839
Barbara, are you really
willing to sell your soul

06:32.840 --> 06:34.440
to the guys who make
toothbrushes

06:34.441 --> 06:35.775
and... and...
and... and...

06:35.776 --> 06:38.612
<i>and the holders
for toothbrushes?</i>

06:38.613 --> 06:40.847
Yeah, they're the guys
who fund the members

06:40.848 --> 06:42.816
of your clean jobs commission.

06:42.817 --> 06:46.553
I could draw you a diagram, but it
would be a very simple diagram.

06:46.554 --> 06:48.889
Oh, I can handle geometry,
Barbara, all right?

06:48.890 --> 06:51.391
<i>- Come on, I've got to get going.
- Yes, well, I have...</i>

06:51.392 --> 06:54.094
a ton on my agenda as well.

06:54.095 --> 06:57.498
Watch this.
Uh, senator Reeves just died.

06:57.499 --> 06:59.066
- Oh.
- ( Gasps )

06:59.067 --> 07:01.635
- Oh.
- Rapey Reeves.

07:01.636 --> 07:05.105
He was the first senator to welcome
me to the Capitol, you know?

07:05.106 --> 07:06.706
He was old even then.

07:06.707 --> 07:09.676
- Was he full of wisdom?
- He was full of bourbon.

07:09.677 --> 07:11.711
And he grabbed my left tit.

07:11.712 --> 07:13.746
- Remember that?
- And God rest his soul.

07:13.747 --> 07:17.083
Hey, did you fire
your tweet monkey yet?

07:17.084 --> 07:20.287
Because that guy
is a weapons-grade retard.

07:20.288 --> 07:22.889
I think you might have been
hoist by your own retard there.

07:22.890 --> 07:24.558
( Laughs )
That's a good one.

07:24.559 --> 07:25.792
Your own retard.
Nice.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.395
<i>- See you downstairs.
- Yeah.</i>

07:27.396 --> 07:29.563
- Honor to have met you, madam.
- Oh, thank you, Dan.

07:29.564 --> 07:31.666
I really admired
your primaries campaign.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.301
Oh, how nice.
Thank you very much.

07:33.302 --> 07:34.803
Two things I would
have done differently.

07:34.804 --> 07:37.605
Two things? Oh, no kidding.
What were they?

07:37.606 --> 07:40.041
I think you spent too much time
in new Hampshire. That was in the bag.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.310
And the attack ads in Oregon
came up four days too soon,

07:42.311 --> 07:44.012
made you seem mean
before you had to be.

07:44.013 --> 07:46.280
But, I mean, hey,
you're the old pro here.

07:46.281 --> 07:47.915
- Gary: Ooh!
- You're the pro.

07:47.916 --> 07:50.384
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

07:53.154 --> 07:54.721
<i>Mike: Sorry about the
Senate meeting.</i>

07:54.722 --> 07:58.058
Yeah, it was like a funeral
for a homeless guy.

07:58.059 --> 08:00.427
- How was Hallowes?
- Oh, you know, the usual.

08:00.428 --> 08:02.628
( Mocking accent )
"Selina, hi.

08:02.629 --> 08:05.465
I'm melting.
I'm melting."

08:05.466 --> 08:07.100
She is such a fucking bitch.

08:07.101 --> 08:10.003
So today at the 3:30
press call,

08:10.004 --> 08:11.438
what do you want me
to say about plastics?

08:11.439 --> 08:14.708
- I think our best agenda is to reassure...
- Whoa.

08:14.709 --> 08:16.476
- I know. Don't tell me.
- What?

08:16.477 --> 08:19.546
If I genuinely don't know, then those
bastards can't make me tell them.

08:19.547 --> 08:21.615
You know my motto,
"I don't want to know."

08:21.616 --> 08:23.784
Anyways, what motto?
I don't have a motto.

08:24.886 --> 08:27.255
Hey, Sue.
Did the president call?

08:27.256 --> 08:28.957
- No.
- No.

08:28.958 --> 08:30.526
Hey, Sue,
that is a lovely dress.

08:30.527 --> 08:32.294
<i>- Thank you, Gary. Madam Vice President.
- Yeah?</i>

08:32.294 --> 08:34.030
We're gonna need to
resync your BlackBerry.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.965
- Okay.
- The diary's been violated.

08:35.966 --> 08:37.634
Ma'am, here's your coffee.
It's really hot.

08:37.635 --> 08:38.967
Can you put it
down right there?

08:38.969 --> 08:41.104
Oh, Gary.
Um...

08:43.307 --> 08:46.176
Oh. Oh, my God,
what was I just gonna say?

08:46.177 --> 08:47.978
( Whimpers )

08:47.979 --> 08:50.481
Oh.

08:50.482 --> 08:53.117
I don't know.
It just went out of my head.

08:53.118 --> 08:54.385
- It'll come to me later.
- Okay.

08:54.386 --> 08:56.453
And Jonah is here
from the White House.

08:56.454 --> 08:58.288
I told him you were
too busy to see him,

08:58.289 --> 09:00.857
but, as you see, he ignored
me and, by implication, you.

09:00.858 --> 09:02.425
- Hi.
- Oh, Madam Vice President.

09:02.426 --> 09:05.228
Close the door. On your way out, close it.
Quickly. Quick, quick.

09:05.229 --> 09:06.762
Quick, quick.
God Almighty.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.430
No.

09:08.431 --> 09:10.098
You, did you check the Wikipedia?

09:10.099 --> 09:11.666
Did they change
her weight again?

09:11.667 --> 09:14.202
Somebody keeps hacking into the
site and changing her weight.

09:14.203 --> 09:15.870
Oh, Jonah.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.639
Good new Italian place
opened up downtown, Amy.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.376
- You like Italian?
- I love Italian, Jonah,

09:21.377 --> 09:23.577
but still, unfortunately,
really dislike you.

09:23.578 --> 09:26.480
Oh, I wasn't asking you out.
I don't want you to think

09:26.481 --> 09:28.215
that was a burn because
I wasn't asking you out.

09:28.216 --> 09:30.650
Hey, it's the guy
from "My Left Foot."

09:30.651 --> 09:33.786
Jonah, how many times have you
talked to the president today?

09:33.787 --> 09:35.921
Oh, you want to know?

09:35.922 --> 09:39.259
Yeah, 'cause you need to put it up on
that star chart on your refrigerator.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.328
- He actually spoke to me four times today.
- Four?

09:41.329 --> 09:44.198
Briefing room, N.S.C. meeting,
hallway twice.

09:44.199 --> 09:45.933
And in each
of those did he say,

09:45.934 --> 09:48.002
"Someone get this freak
the fuck away from me"?

09:48.003 --> 09:50.205
- ( Amy laughs )
- Hi, Jonah.

09:50.206 --> 09:52.541
What's the news
from the mountaintop?

09:52.542 --> 09:55.645
- The White House would like...
- Hang on just a second.

09:55.646 --> 09:57.513
Can you do me there?

09:57.514 --> 09:59.448
- Doing you.
- What?

09:59.449 --> 10:01.884
The White House would like you
to atend at 6:00 P.M.

10:01.885 --> 10:03.820
S.R.V.A. Fund-raiser tonight
instead of the President.

10:03.821 --> 10:05.688
- Oh, no, that's not gonna happen.
- Not on the schedule.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.230
The POTUS doesn't want to get hit
with questions

10:07.231 --> 10:08.958
on the fiscal responsibility bill.

10:08.959 --> 10:10.393
- Uh-huh.
- Obviously they won't ask you guys

10:10.394 --> 10:12.161
because you have no...

10:12.162 --> 10:15.831
um, you just have other
areas of expertise.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.734
Yeah, clean jobs,
Yemen, mission to Mars.

10:18.735 --> 10:20.603
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
I'm busy tonight.

10:20.604 --> 10:23.439
Yeah, we're positioning ourselves right
now with the clean jobs commission.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.876
But the President of the
United States of America

10:26.877 --> 10:29.011
- is very keen...
- Uh-huh.

10:29.012 --> 10:30.645
That your going
to the fund-raiser should be

10:30.646 --> 10:33.148
fundamentally
the sequence of events

10:33.149 --> 10:35.416
that does actually
take place this evening.

10:39.455 --> 10:42.157
I will make a call.

10:42.158 --> 10:43.670
Thank you.

10:43.671 --> 10:46.028
And I'd like you
to watch your tone with me.

10:46.029 --> 10:47.196
- I will watch my tone.
- Yeah.

10:47.197 --> 10:49.299
And, Mike, you need
to be there, too, okay?

10:49.300 --> 10:50.967
So no going home
to walk your dog.

10:50.968 --> 10:53.971
Uh, don't tell me what to
do, Doogie Fucking Howser.

10:53.972 --> 10:56.374
I don't know what that means.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.042
- Or your "left foot" thing.
- Great movie.

10:59.043 --> 11:01.678
Okay, well, I'm going to
go back to the White House.

11:01.679 --> 11:03.981
That address makes me hard.

11:03.982 --> 11:06.550
Kiss you, miss you.

11:06.551 --> 11:09.386
( Sirens blaring )

11:09.387 --> 11:12.022
Hey, Mike.

11:12.023 --> 11:15.025
What would you say were the two

11:15.026 --> 11:17.226
biggest campaign mistakes
that we made?

11:17.227 --> 11:19.161
You looked tired a lot
and the hat.

11:19.162 --> 11:21.119
I liked the hat.
What are you talking about?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.798
The hat hurt us.

11:22.799 --> 11:26.368
<i>Your head looked weird in the hat,
that's all I'm gonna say.</i>

11:26.369 --> 11:28.570
Okay...

11:28.571 --> 11:30.238
What do you think of Dan?

11:30.239 --> 11:32.740
Oh, Dan is a shit.

11:32.741 --> 11:34.776
You want to expand on that?

11:34.777 --> 11:38.747
Sure. He's a massive
and total shit.

11:38.748 --> 11:40.882
When you first meet him,
you think surely to God

11:40.883 --> 11:44.219
this man can't be as big
a shit as he seems,

11:44.220 --> 11:46.087
but he is.

11:46.088 --> 11:48.590
- See, I...
- 'Cause like if there were a book

11:48.591 --> 11:51.527
with covers made of shit, you'd
think, "That's intriguing.

11:51.528 --> 11:53.629
I wonder what's in this book
that they saw fit

11:53.630 --> 11:55.531
to give it covers
made of pure shit."

11:55.532 --> 11:59.101
And then you open it
and... shit.

12:02.071 --> 12:04.405
- ( Applause )
- Thank you so much. Yes.

12:04.406 --> 12:07.375
How are you?
I see you. I see you.

12:07.376 --> 12:10.210
There's congresswoman Clements,
you should speak with her.

12:10.211 --> 12:12.413
She's got a small mustache.
It's a little disturbing.

12:12.414 --> 12:13.981
- Don't stare at it, okay?
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

12:13.982 --> 12:16.083
The podium is
definitely too high.

12:16.084 --> 12:18.452
- Box me, Gary. Box me.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.560
What is the utensil situation?
Is it Cornstarch or plastic here?

12:25.561 --> 12:27.528
Stay away from both.
The utensils are politicized.

12:27.529 --> 12:31.065
You could use celery
as a kind of shovel.

12:31.066 --> 12:35.102
I cannot believe you are
dating your boss's daughter.

12:35.103 --> 12:38.573
She's fun, she's sexy.
She can advance my career.

12:38.574 --> 12:40.541
- I really like her.
- That's the one.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.042
- She's great.
- That's the one.

12:42.043 --> 12:44.311
We need to talk about
the V.P.'S speech, okay?

12:44.312 --> 12:46.312
- What?
- Can I just...

12:46.313 --> 12:48.448
- Don't grab my shit.
- Thank you.

12:48.449 --> 12:51.617
White House says we need
to majorly redact this, okay?

12:51.618 --> 12:53.118
I'll redact your fucking face.

12:53.119 --> 12:54.887
The White House
does not want anything

12:54.888 --> 12:56.388
in the papers tomorrow
about oil, okay?

12:56.389 --> 12:58.691
- What?
- Or plastics.

12:58.692 --> 13:01.994
- Nothing about Cornstarch.
- Her whole position is green jobs.

13:01.995 --> 13:04.264
Is doesn't come from me,
okay, so just do it.

13:04.265 --> 13:06.266
You love this.
You love this.

13:06.267 --> 13:08.268
I'm not gonna say
I don't enjoy it.

13:08.269 --> 13:11.105
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to welcome you all

13:11.106 --> 13:13.207
here tonight
and thank you for coming.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.642
- Hi, Selina.
- Hey.

13:14.643 --> 13:16.544
- Just a small change in the speech.
- What is that?

13:16.545 --> 13:18.846
Plastics apparently
talked to the president.

13:18.847 --> 13:22.082
The White House doesn't want us
mentioning oil or Cornstarch or plastic.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.951
Just wing it.

13:23.952 --> 13:26.586
This has been pencil-fucked
completely?

13:26.587 --> 13:29.356
Uh, yes, front and back.
Very little romance.

13:29.357 --> 13:31.391
That's the entire speech, okay?

13:31.392 --> 13:33.293
What's left here?
I've got "hello"

13:33.294 --> 13:35.462
and I have...
Preposions.

13:35.463 --> 13:37.430
Well, you could
talk about your boat.

13:37.431 --> 13:38.932
- Or something like that.
- Sure, talk about the boat.

13:38.933 --> 13:41.534
Gary, seriously, can you
just shut up for 10 seconds?

13:41.535 --> 13:43.369
Okay, now I can't read
what you're writing.

13:43.370 --> 13:45.505
Relax, you're really good
at Senate vote reform.

13:45.506 --> 13:46.740
Hit that one.
That's a home run.

13:46.741 --> 13:48.074
That's your
"Sergeant Pepper's."

13:48.075 --> 13:49.476
We can also use
my kitten heels gag.

13:49.477 --> 13:50.677
- All right. Is that funny?
- No.

13:50.678 --> 13:51.912
It's funny enough
for these people.

13:51.913 --> 13:54.181
- Hit the verbs.
- Thank you, I've got it.

13:54.182 --> 13:57.050
It's fine, I can do it.
I can't... I don't know what that is.

13:57.051 --> 13:59.186
Please welcome
Vice President Selina Meyer.

13:59.187 --> 14:01.155
- Go for the money.
- It's just pennies.

14:01.156 --> 14:02.923
Hey.

14:02.924 --> 14:05.493
Hi. Oh!

14:05.494 --> 14:08.997
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished guests,

14:08.998 --> 14:10.965
as I'm sure you're aware,

14:10.966 --> 14:14.937
I have stepped into the
president's shoes this evening,

14:14.938 --> 14:16.905
and, uh...

14:16.906 --> 14:19.008
Who knew he wore kitten heels?

14:19.009 --> 14:21.743
( Laughs )

14:21.744 --> 14:23.712
<i>Selina:
No, he of course doesn't.</i>

14:23.713 --> 14:26.582
He's more of a stilettos
kind of guy.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.618
( Chuckles )

14:28.619 --> 14:31.188
Um...

14:33.425 --> 14:35.459
( Stammers )

14:35.460 --> 14:36.894
All kidding aside,

14:36.895 --> 14:39.663
I am reminded tonight

14:39.664 --> 14:43.166
of the late
senator David Reeves.

14:46.837 --> 14:49.138
He died.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.373
He's...
he's dead now.

14:51.374 --> 14:54.176
And I remember dear David

14:54.177 --> 14:56.878
talking to the president
and myself

14:56.879 --> 14:59.348
about the absurdity of allowing

14:59.349 --> 15:02.351
<i>multiple filibusters
on a single bill.</i>

15:02.352 --> 15:04.753
And...

15:07.457 --> 15:11.360
Politics is about people.

15:13.731 --> 15:15.632
It's about people.

15:19.404 --> 15:22.639
- Uh...
- Is your guy gonna be tweeting about this?

15:22.640 --> 15:25.208
( Crowd laughs )

15:25.209 --> 15:27.911
Okay, well, let me
put it this way, Sam,

15:27.912 --> 15:31.515
that guy is no longer in a position
to pay his iPhone contract.

15:31.516 --> 15:33.384
( All chuckle )

15:33.385 --> 15:37.422
That's because Mike McClintock there
threw him into the Potomac River.

15:37.423 --> 15:40.324
( Laughs )

15:40.325 --> 15:42.794
Oh, boy. It seems with
that Cornstarch tweet,

15:42.795 --> 15:45.229
we were hoist
by our own retard.

15:45.230 --> 15:47.464
( Laughing stops )

15:47.465 --> 15:50.333
Uh, so...

15:50.334 --> 15:52.202
I know. I know.
I know what I said.

15:52.203 --> 15:54.337
It's the use
of the word "retard."

15:54.338 --> 15:56.139
- It's just not...
- But it was joke. It was joke.

15:56.140 --> 15:57.607
And then everything went silent.

15:57.608 --> 16:00.611
If I could, I think it would
behoove you to make an apology

16:00.612 --> 16:02.580
as soon as possible, in which case
I can get someone in your office

16:02.581 --> 16:05.283
from an appropriate
mental health charity...

16:05.284 --> 16:07.619
Who the fuck is pretty boy?
Who the fuck is pretty boy?

16:07.620 --> 16:10.022
Look, it's going to be in the papers
tomorrow.

16:10.023 --> 16:12.825
Not necessarily. Let's not make
it the story and panic, okay?

16:12.826 --> 16:14.794
- What if Tom Hanks dies?
- What?

16:14.795 --> 16:16.996
- What a dark thought.
- I'm not wishing that.

16:16.997 --> 16:18.764
I'm saying anything could
happen... Tom Hanks could die,

16:18.765 --> 16:20.399
there could be
a forest fire in L.A.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.801
How did you get this job?
You really want to base your press strategy

16:22.802 --> 16:24.603
based on trying to figure
out when Tom Hanks is gonna...

16:24.604 --> 16:27.405
- Did someone order a dick-o-gram here?
- Amy: Yes, seemingly.

16:27.406 --> 16:29.240
Can we not strategize
in a closet?

16:29.241 --> 16:32.142
All right, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna walk slowly to the car, okay?

16:32.143 --> 16:34.311
But you guys surround me,
very purposeful.

16:34.312 --> 16:35.979
- Like a human motorcade.
- Exactly.

16:35.980 --> 16:39.182
- We're discussing important things.
- Like the pope.

16:39.183 --> 16:41.184
<i>- Come on.
- Mike: Let's just roll.</i>

16:41.185 --> 16:43.821
- And smile, though. Smile, smile.
- Wonderful job.

16:43.822 --> 16:46.791
Smiling.
And we're gonna talk about that.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.460
It's not enough of a motor...

16:48.461 --> 16:50.696
surround me more, though.
Surround it.

16:50.697 --> 16:52.698
- Surround me.
- Okay, I've got it. I've got it.

16:52.699 --> 16:56.101
I need to keep these off your jacket 'cause
the static attracts and retains dirt.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.437
Selina: Thank you, Gary.
Making physics fun.

16:58.438 --> 17:01.940
Every minute that we delay,
"Retard" goes up a font size.

17:01.941 --> 17:03.408
Amy: Well, then
start the process.

17:03.409 --> 17:05.542
Mike, we're gonna have to
have you pull an all-nighter.

17:05.544 --> 17:06.978
No, I can't.
I've got the dog.

17:06.979 --> 17:09.113
Okay, listen.
Mike, you go home.

17:09.114 --> 17:11.615
Feed the dog.
Walk the dog.

17:11.616 --> 17:13.717
Shoot the dog.
Bury the dog.

17:13.718 --> 17:16.554
- And then come back in, okay?
- The dog will be fine.

17:18.223 --> 17:20.458
She was trying to be funny.

17:20.459 --> 17:23.060
I know. She's not funny.
Of course I know that.

17:23.061 --> 17:25.696
No, no, no. She won't be
available for that, either. No.

17:25.698 --> 17:29.034
I can't say no to you again,
so I'm just going to...

17:30.704 --> 17:32.205
Good morning.

17:32.206 --> 17:34.674
Seen this?

17:35.943 --> 17:38.845
Everybody seen it?
Everybody got a good look?

17:38.846 --> 17:42.048
Front page of the style section
of the "Washington Post."

17:42.049 --> 17:44.850
You're the head of
communications, is that correct?

17:44.851 --> 17:46.885
- Yes, ma'am.
- Tuck your shirt in.

17:46.886 --> 17:49.387
Okay? Your dick is hanging
out of your pants.

17:50.789 --> 17:52.523
Sue, did the president call?

17:52.524 --> 17:54.558
- No.
- No.

17:57.595 --> 18:00.030
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, God.

18:00.031 --> 18:04.167
Hey, what colossal fuckup are
we dealing with this morning?

18:04.168 --> 18:07.437
Did the VEEP kill the last
remaining snow leopard?

18:07.438 --> 18:09.839
Did she firebomb a hospice?

18:09.840 --> 18:11.708
I don't have time
to ignore you, Jonah.

18:11.709 --> 18:13.776
Gary, could you please
ignore Jonah for me?

18:13.777 --> 18:16.112
- What do you want, Jonah?
- I have a condolence card

18:16.113 --> 18:17.546
for senator Reeves' widow.

18:17.547 --> 18:20.049
POTUS has signed,
the VPOTUS needs to sign.

18:20.050 --> 18:22.051
And then I'm gonna take
this to the Hill, okay?

18:22.052 --> 18:24.887
You talk as if you're passing
the civil rights act.

18:24.888 --> 18:27.890
- Look alive, gang.
- Hey, good-looking. What you got cooking?

18:27.891 --> 18:29.959
Dickwad pie?

18:29.960 --> 18:31.994
Amy, this is Paul Burton.
He's the chair

18:31.995 --> 18:34.096
of the American Foundation for
Adult Mental Disabilities.

18:34.097 --> 18:36.498
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Amy.

18:36.499 --> 18:38.334
Mr. Burton, love to bring
you into my office.

18:38.335 --> 18:41.337
- Thank you.
- Did you know that I have my own flag?

18:41.338 --> 18:44.974
Ma'am, I have a condolence card
here for senator Reeves' widow.

18:44.975 --> 18:47.744
Oh, Amy, can you...

18:47.745 --> 18:50.947
- Gary, we are going to need two coffees.
- Okay.

18:50.948 --> 18:53.416
- Shouldn't that be three?
- Two is good.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.554
Uh, guys, a man is dead.

18:57.555 --> 19:01.023
When a sexual harasser dies,
we sign his wife's card.

19:01.024 --> 19:03.059
Okay? That's how
Washington works.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.428
- I will sign it.
- Fine, thank you.

19:05.429 --> 19:08.164
That was her telling me
to sign her name.

19:08.165 --> 19:10.433
If she'd wanted me to sign your
name, she would have done this...

19:10.434 --> 19:12.635
( Grunting )

19:12.636 --> 19:14.570
That didn't get me.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.339
Selina:
I mean, I misjudged things.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.807
Fundamentally,
I would say I misjoked.

19:18.808 --> 19:20.576
I mean, if we were
gonna really be...

19:20.577 --> 19:23.012
Ha-ha!
Tall, dark and tiresome,

19:23.013 --> 19:25.281
<i>you need to get back
to your boss's corner.</i>

19:25.282 --> 19:27.450
Hallowes is on the ropes.
She was reported by the blog

19:27.451 --> 19:30.853
saying that the late senator Reeves
had a history of sexual misconduct.

19:30.854 --> 19:33.822
Yeah, well, you know what?
I don't work for senator Hallowes.

19:33.823 --> 19:35.524
I resigned
just about an hour ago.

19:35.525 --> 19:39.027
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, right after I leaked that story.

19:39.028 --> 19:40.996
- What are you planning?
- What?

19:40.997 --> 19:42.698
- What?
- What?

19:42.699 --> 19:45.802
<i>Can you please keep your eye on him,
please?</i>

19:45.803 --> 19:48.472
- 'Cause this is shady shit.
- Okay.

19:48.473 --> 19:51.074
All right, Mike,
here's what we do, okay?

19:51.075 --> 19:53.444
At the 11:30, you say
that senator Hallowes

19:53.445 --> 19:55.112
not only insulted
the late senator Reeves,

19:55.113 --> 19:56.981
but that she also encouraged...

19:56.982 --> 19:59.517
no, wait, strike that...
she goaded

19:59.518 --> 20:02.353
the V.P. into using
the word retard in a joke.

20:02.354 --> 20:04.655
See what I'm doing?
Senator Hallowes

20:04.656 --> 20:06.656
is responsible for retardgate.

20:06.657 --> 20:09.092
Are you like a guy
trying to be clever?

20:09.093 --> 20:11.228
'Cause you seem like a guy who
thinks he's being clever.

20:11.229 --> 20:14.264
Take a good look at me okay?

20:14.265 --> 20:16.366
Now ask yourself
something, Mike.

20:16.367 --> 20:17.700
Is the man you're looking at

20:17.701 --> 20:20.003
gonna be in a position
a year from now

20:20.004 --> 20:21.839
working above you or below you?

20:21.840 --> 20:24.108
'Cause all ambition you had
left your body a long time ago

20:24.109 --> 20:27.111
<i>and now all you've got left in the last
10 remaining years of your working life</i>

20:27.112 --> 20:29.180
is a damp apartment,
cold crab cakes,

20:29.181 --> 20:30.749
and an invisible fucking dog.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.751
Do you want to follow
this plan or not?

20:32.752 --> 20:34.720
Make a calculation, buddy.

20:34.721 --> 20:36.355
Um...

20:36.356 --> 20:40.526
In your poly-sci B.A., did you ever
learn how to write a press release?

20:40.527 --> 20:41.727
I think I might
have heard of that.

20:41.728 --> 20:42.928
- Let me teach you.
- Okay.

20:42.929 --> 20:44.963
Did Jonah leave?

20:44.964 --> 20:47.265
Is he gone with
that condolence card?

20:47.266 --> 20:48.533
Yeah, he just left.

20:48.534 --> 20:53.003
'Cause I think
that I signed my name.

20:53.004 --> 20:55.439
- What?
- Not Selina's name, my name.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.041
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait.

20:57.042 --> 21:00.277
How sure are you on a scale of one to 10?
Like one is the...

21:00.278 --> 21:02.347
Yeah, yeah, I can work out how
the fucking scale will go, Gary.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.549
- Uh, nine.
- That's almost a full 10.

21:04.550 --> 21:06.985
- Yeah, I signed my name.
- Oh, father.

21:06.986 --> 21:09.387
It's gonna look like the VEEP
couldn't be bothered to sign

21:09.388 --> 21:12.390
a condolence card for one of the most
respected perverts in the Senate.

21:12.391 --> 21:14.125
If I were writing a memoir,
which I'm not,

21:14.126 --> 21:17.863
but if I were, whew,
this would be a big moment.

21:17.864 --> 21:19.665
No one can know about this.

21:19.666 --> 21:21.467
<i>- She cannot know about this.
- Sue: Duh.</i>

21:21.468 --> 21:25.771
- No, no, no, Gary!
- Gary, what are you doing?

21:25.772 --> 21:29.275
<i>Gary: So sorry.
I just need to tell you somethg.</i>

21:40.221 --> 21:43.189
What the fuck, Amy?

21:46.093 --> 21:49.863
I am putting out
two fires in there,

21:49.864 --> 21:53.533
and I turn around to find out
that you have set fire

21:53.534 --> 21:55.302
to the fucking fire truck.

21:55.303 --> 21:57.104
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:57.105 --> 22:01.175
The level of incompetence
in this office is staggering.

22:01.176 --> 22:03.343
We are going
to get the card back

22:03.344 --> 22:04.878
and replace it with a new one.

22:04.879 --> 22:06.813
- Yeah, that's right.
- Simple.

22:06.814 --> 22:08.376
You're gonna get on it.

22:08.377 --> 22:11.184
You are going to shut this
the fuck down, okay?

22:11.185 --> 22:15.823
Because I am busy in there
apologizing to that...

22:15.824 --> 22:17.558
Fucktard.

22:20.696 --> 22:22.030
God!

22:22.031 --> 22:24.933
Okay. It's fine.

22:26.836 --> 22:29.537
Mr. Burton.
I am so sorry.

22:29.538 --> 22:31.573
We're having
a complicated day here.

22:33.610 --> 22:35.878
I'm not happy about having
to give this press briefing.

22:35.879 --> 22:38.314
Yeah, and of course your
happiness is top of my agenda,

22:38.315 --> 22:40.349
right above climate control
and child trafficking.

22:40.350 --> 22:42.585
Oh, my gosh, is this gonna
become like "Moonlighting"

22:42.586 --> 22:44.220
where we fall in love
and start fucking?

22:44.221 --> 22:48.224
Amy: Gary is going to
go to Jonah's office

22:48.225 --> 22:52.429
and somewhat surreptitiously
get the card back.

22:52.430 --> 22:54.131
Well, I don't have a coat.
I need to hide the card.

22:54.132 --> 22:55.799
There's coffee on my coat.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.467
<i>Sue:
You can borrow my coat.</i>

22:57.468 --> 22:59.402
Thank you, Sue.
Thank you, Sue.

22:59.403 --> 23:00.937
- Thanks, Sue.
- Solution, Sue.

23:00.938 --> 23:03.773
- Of course. There's some solutions.
- Thank you.

23:05.676 --> 23:09.812
Thank you so much.
That was really kind of you.

23:09.813 --> 23:12.681
First of all, you should
put the hood down.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.050
I wasn't going
to put the hood up.

23:15.051 --> 23:16.919
Well, good luck, Gary.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.788
I am convinced that you
can probably do this.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.324
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:21.325 --> 23:23.959
<i>Sue: Want me to ring through,
tell them you're coming?</i>

23:23.960 --> 23:26.362
<i>- No, my God!
- Okay, okay, a joke.</i>

23:26.363 --> 23:29.065
Hello.
Lightening the mood here.

23:29.066 --> 23:32.435
- Oh, my God.
- Amy, come up with a plan B.

23:32.436 --> 23:33.904
Okay? 'Cause...

23:39.911 --> 23:42.813
( Inhales )

23:50.587 --> 23:52.688
Gary?

23:56.125 --> 23:57.492
Jonah.

23:57.493 --> 23:59.428
Are you here to steal
the incorrectly-signed card?

23:59.429 --> 24:02.732
- Come on, no.
- This looks really bad.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.235
- It's not bad.
- Gary, I'm a friend of yours.

24:05.236 --> 24:08.038
I don't think you are.

24:08.039 --> 24:09.640
- At all.
- I'm just kidding.

24:09.641 --> 24:13.010
Gary, loosen up, okay?
I'm gonna give you the card, all right?

24:13.011 --> 24:15.680
Alright.
To be honest, I was a little scared.

24:15.681 --> 24:17.248
- ( Laughs )
- Yeah, yeah.

24:17.249 --> 24:19.651
- There it is.
- Thank you.

24:19.652 --> 24:21.186
- It's just really...
- Okay.

24:21.187 --> 24:23.722
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just get to the bad part.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.724
Let's just get to the bad part
'cause I know you got one.

24:25.725 --> 24:28.560
I don't like tension. I got acid reflux.
Let's get to the bad part.

24:28.561 --> 24:31.229
I want Amy to go on
a date with me tonight.

24:31.230 --> 24:34.433
Okay, okay, okay.
That's impossible.

24:34.434 --> 24:36.502
Don't worry about it, okay?
We're not gonna have sex, all right?

24:36.503 --> 24:38.404
- Because she hates me.
- Okay. Uh-huh.

24:38.405 --> 24:41.207
- But Amy's an eight.
- Okay.

24:41.208 --> 24:44.043
And if all the other eights
that I do want to have sex with

24:44.044 --> 24:45.945
see that I am eight-capable,

24:45.946 --> 24:49.082
then I'm going to be having
sex with an eight very soon.

24:49.083 --> 24:50.450
It is intern season, Gary.

24:50.451 --> 24:52.753
Do I look like a pimp to you?

24:52.754 --> 24:56.056
You look exactly like a pimp.

24:57.492 --> 25:00.194
Dan, waiting for
some crumbs to fall?

25:00.195 --> 25:01.829
- Fuck off.
- Sue: Uh, no.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.431
Got to talk to her
for one moment, please.

25:03.432 --> 25:05.633
No, she's actually really burdened
right now with a bunch of...

25:05.634 --> 25:07.935
Sue, it'll take
one second, literally.

25:07.936 --> 25:11.038
- Mike, she's spinning.
- Oh, okay. I'll come back.

25:17.145 --> 25:19.279
Hey, what's up, pumpkin?

25:19.280 --> 25:21.315
What the fuck are you
still doing here?

25:21.316 --> 25:23.384
Vice President
asked me to stop by.

25:23.385 --> 25:25.119
Right.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.822
( Chants ) Go, Gary.
Go, go, go, Gary.

25:27.823 --> 25:30.692
- Go, Gary.
- Well done, buddy.

25:30.693 --> 25:32.460
- No, you didn't.
- Yes.

25:32.461 --> 25:33.995
<i>- You got it?
- Yes, I did.</i>

25:33.996 --> 25:36.731
Wow, Gary.
Good for you.

25:36.732 --> 25:38.599
Good for... oh.
Excuse me.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.168
Hey, all right.

25:40.169 --> 25:42.270
Yeah, although I did have
to make a deal with Jonah.

25:42.271 --> 25:44.773
Amy's got to go on a date
with him tonight.

25:44.774 --> 25:47.042
- ( Laughing )
- Oh, no, she's not.

25:47.043 --> 25:48.810
Well, he doesn't want
to have sex with you.

25:48.811 --> 25:50.279
He just wants
dinner and a movie.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.815
No, Amy is not going
on a date with Jonah.

25:52.816 --> 25:56.551
Get a grip.
It's a date and no sex.

25:56.552 --> 25:58.987
For me, that was
12 years of marriage.

25:58.988 --> 26:01.923
- I'll get you guys a motel.
- Ugh.

26:01.924 --> 26:03.826
<i>Selina:
Oh, God, no!</i>

26:03.827 --> 26:06.295
Make a hole! Make a hole!
Make a hole!

26:06.296 --> 26:07.929
- Oh, my God.
- Look at this.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.298
- What? What?
- Look.

26:09.299 --> 26:11.867
The President
already signed this one.

26:11.868 --> 26:16.071
Okay? We're gonna have to forge the
President's signature on the new one.

26:16.072 --> 26:17.673
<i>Gary: Well, that's
a capital offense.</i>

26:17.674 --> 26:20.842
Yeah, you could be legally electrocuted
for doing that, just so you know.

26:20.843 --> 26:23.145
I'm not here.
I have plausible deniability.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.712
<i>Dan: Look, I'll do it. I got it.</i>

26:24.713 --> 26:27.815
The key is
you do it upside down.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.385
That is extraordinary.

26:31.386 --> 26:33.086
Is there anything you can't do?

26:33.087 --> 26:35.422
Amy: Foreplay, direct sunlight.

26:35.423 --> 26:38.525
- Ma'am, I am at your service.
- Um, Amy, yes.

26:38.526 --> 26:41.094
I wanted to talk
to you about this.

26:41.095 --> 26:43.797
I have offered Dan
a permanent post

26:43.798 --> 26:45.699
- here in the office.
- Okay.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.601
- Great.
- Not a problem.

26:47.602 --> 26:49.337
I'll get the BlackBerry
fired up.

26:49.338 --> 26:51.839
- Sounds good to me.
- Here we go.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.343
- Do you have a second?
- Sure.

26:56.312 --> 26:58.314
- You hired him?
- Mm-hmm.

26:58.315 --> 26:59.648
You hired the biggest
bastard in D.C.?

26:59.649 --> 27:01.651
Oh, yeah, well,
I'm fluent in bastard.

27:01.652 --> 27:03.119
Okay? It's one
of my languages.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.656
Amy, I used Dan
to get what I wanted.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.292
He used you to get
what he wanted.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.195
Uh-uh, no.
I definitely used him.

27:11.196 --> 27:13.464
I'm the user,
and he's the usee.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.267
Okay, Amy, here we go.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.136
Shrimp Linguini and a porno.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.837
Oh, hey.
I'm just kidding.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.806
It's chicken Linguini.
I'll be over here.

27:21.807 --> 27:25.043
Dan is manipulative.
He is cunning.

27:25.044 --> 27:28.046
I know. That's why I hired him.
Why aren't you listening to me?

27:28.047 --> 27:31.349
In six months,
when all this bullshit dies down,

27:31.350 --> 27:34.018
we're gonna put an oil guy
on the clean jobs commission.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.186
You're pouring oil
on clean jobs?

27:36.187 --> 27:38.556
Oh, please, please,
Amy, grow up.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.026
This is how they solved
the Cuban missile crisis.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.527
This is my Cuba.

27:42.528 --> 27:45.030
Did Dan tell you
that this is your Cuba?

27:45.031 --> 27:46.566
He's such a shit.

27:46.567 --> 27:48.134
I know, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

27:48.135 --> 27:51.672
You sold him to me as a shit
and that's why I hired him.

27:51.673 --> 27:54.374
He's shitty me, okay?
I need a shit.

27:54.375 --> 27:58.778
<i>- You are so going to regret...
- Amy, I need a shit.</i>

27:58.779 --> 28:01.180
- Knock, knock. Hello.
- Hello.

28:01.181 --> 28:04.517
Bob Jeffries of the Plastics
and Cellulose Association.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.018
- Madam Vice President.
- How do you do?

28:06.019 --> 28:07.720
- Please, come into my office.
- Thank you so much.

28:07.721 --> 28:09.522
Do you know that
I have my own flag?

28:09.523 --> 28:12.424
Well, I hope that's one
of our cellulose flags.

28:12.425 --> 28:14.559
( Selina laughs )
Oh, you're too much.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.536
Jonah:
Your chariot awaits.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.105
So, yeah, grab your coat.

28:27.106 --> 28:31.009
Okay, little Jack Horner,
there you are.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.845
You got a brand-new desk
in the corner.

28:32.846 --> 28:34.546
Follow me, I've got
a beautiful spot

28:34.547 --> 28:37.349
for your adoring photo
of girlfriend Carol Hallowes.

28:37.350 --> 28:39.084
Actually, she's not
my girlfriend anymore.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.419
I just broke up with her about
15 minutes ago via text.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.356
- Well, cold and rather nerdy.
- Actually, it was an app.

28:44.357 --> 28:46.558
All right, move out.
Slick's moving in.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.895
Selina: Gary, can we get
two coffees in here?

28:49.896 --> 28:52.397
No sweeteners.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.883
- Gary: No sweeteners?
- Sugar.

28:54.884 --> 28:57.268
- No sweeteners?
- No sweeteners. Sugar.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.625
Touch me
and you lose a finger.

29:03.352 --> 29:04.352
And a ball.
