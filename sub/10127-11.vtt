00:45.467 --> 00:49.367
I ONLY DO IT BECAUSE PEOPLE
HAVE COME TO EXPECT IT.

00:49.367 --> 00:52.900
ANYTHING EMBARRASSING ABOUT
YOUR DAD YOU'D CARE TO MENTION?

00:52.900 --> 00:54.800
WELL, AT THIS STAGE
OF YOUR LIFE,

00:54.800 --> 00:56.100
ARE YOU CAPABLE
OF CHANGE?

00:56.100 --> 00:57.600
NOPE.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.967
OK, SO JUST
WHEN YOU DO IT,
SAY, "EXCUSE ME."

01:00.967 --> 01:02.600
ERIC, COME HERE.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.500
WHAT?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.800
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS?

01:07.800 --> 01:10.033
[GASPS] A RING.

01:10.033 --> 01:12.233
THIS IS SO SWEET,
CORY,

01:12.233 --> 01:14.000
BUT I CAN'T
ACCEPT THIS.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.367
WE'RE FAMILY.
IT'D BE WRONG.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.667
NO. IT'S A PROMISE RING
FOR TOPANGA.

01:20.667 --> 01:23.834
IT MEANS WE'RE GONNA...
BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

01:26.567 --> 01:28.033
THAT'S REALLY PRECIOUS.

01:28.033 --> 01:30.700
YOU GUYS MUST BE
THE MOST PRECIOUS COUPLE
IN THE UNIVERSE.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.300
YOU'RE FREAKS.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.600
NO NAKED RUNNING.
YOU GOT IT?

01:38.200 --> 01:40.200
COR, LOOK WHAT I BROUGHT
YOU FOR CHRISTMAS.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.300
OH, LOOK.
MISS TOPANGA HEAD.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.500
HI, GUYS.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.000
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH YOU.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.400
MY PARENTS WENT
ON A CRUISE TO BARBADOS,

01:46.400 --> 01:50.100
BUT I TOLD THEM,
NOPE, I WANTED TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH CORY.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.500
HEY, WHY DON'T WE TOAST

01:51.500 --> 01:52.700
TOPANGA'S FIRST MATTHEWS

01:52.700 --> 01:56.233

OF MY SPECIAL EGGNOG?

01:56.233 --> 01:57.734
YEAH!

01:57.734 --> 01:58.967
Alan: THERE YOU ARE.

01:58.967 --> 02:00.100
MMM. THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.900
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER TRIED
HOT MULLED CIDER?

02:04.767 --> 02:07.100
NO. NOG. WE'RE
AN EGGNOG FAMILY.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.767
WAIT. IF THIS IS TRADITION,

02:09.767 --> 02:11.867
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO
INTERFERE WITH TRADITION.

02:11.867 --> 02:13.300
IT'S JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW,

02:13.300 --> 02:14.934
MY FAMILY'S
ALWAYS HAD CIDER.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.900
WELL, WE CAN
HAVE BOTH, HUH?

02:18.900 --> 02:20.233
HOW?!

02:20.233 --> 02:21.967
HOW COULD WE
HAVE BOTH?

02:21.967 --> 02:23.233
YOU EVER BEEN TO
THE SUPERMARKET?

02:23.233 --> 02:24.567
THE CIDER'S
NOWHERE NEAR
THE EGGNOG.

02:24.567 --> 02:26.200
YOU KNOW WHY?
THEY HATE
EACH OTHER.

02:27.834 --> 02:30.133
GO GET TOPANGA
SOME CIDER.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.700
GAS MONEY?

02:31.700 --> 02:33.200
NO.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.367
GO.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.100
I'M GONNA GO WITH HIM.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.200
LISTEN, TOPANGA,
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
WE CAN GET FOR YOU

02:39.200 --> 02:41.567
THAT'S GONNA MAKE
YOUR CHRISTMAS WITH US
MORE ENJOYABLE?

02:41.567 --> 02:45.000
NO, AND
I'M REALLY SORRY
TO PUT YOU GUYS OUT.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.200
IT'S JUST THAT
CIDER ON CHRISTMAS

02:46.200 --> 02:48.300
IS, LIKE,
MY FAMILY'S
ONE TRADITION.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.734
WELL, THAT AND WE
GO TO OUR FAVORITE
EVERGREEN TREE FARM.

02:50.734 --> 02:51.934
BUT EVERYBODY
HAS ONE OF--

02:51.934 --> 02:53.967
WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT?

02:57.467 --> 02:58.934
AS LONG AS
WE'RE IN VERMONT,

02:58.934 --> 03:01.200
COULD WE STOP
AND GET SOME SYRUP?

03:01.200 --> 03:03.500
WE'D BE NUTS NOT TO.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.734
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BEST CHRISTMAS EVER.

03:08.734 --> 03:11.200
ASK HER IF
SHE STILL WANTS IT
ON THE 25th, COR!

03:16.100 --> 03:18.734
THIS IS
MY FIRST CHRISTMAS
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY,

03:18.734 --> 03:20.367
AND I JUST REALLY
WANT TO THANK YOU

03:20.367 --> 03:22.033
FOR MAKING ME FEEL
LIKE PART OF YOURS.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.400
YOU'RE WELCOME, HONEY.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.900
SO WHAT TIME
ON CHRISTMAS EVE

03:25.900 --> 03:27.200
DO YOU GUYS
OPEN YOUR PRESENTS?

03:27.200 --> 03:29.600
WE OPEN THEM
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.200
OH.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.200
OH?
OH.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.400
OH.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.033
CONFERENCE.
COME HERE. COME HERE.

03:36.033 --> 03:37.800
WHAT? WHAT?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.900
WELCOME TO THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.033
ERIC, SO SHE
OPENS HER PRESENTS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

03:42.033 --> 03:43.300
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT THE PRESENTS.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.600
SO SHE WANTED
A REAL TREE.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.133
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
THE 600-MILE DRIVE
TO VERMONT.

03:46.133 --> 03:48.033
OK, SO SHE MAKES
PURRING NOISES
WHEN WE MAKE OUT.

03:50.967 --> 03:53.100
PERHAPS
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.467
LISTEN...

03:54.467 --> 03:57.000
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
IS TODAY SHE TAKES OVER
CHRISTMAS,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.500
TOMORROW IT'S
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.767
GOOD-BYE, CORY MATTHEWS,
HELLO, WHATEVER
YOUR TOPANGA NAME IS.

04:01.767 --> 04:04.200
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT WHEN WE
OPEN PRESENTS?

04:04.200 --> 04:08.033
AND MY TOPANGA NAME
IS CAPTAIN
TAKE-ME-SHOPPING.

04:08.033 --> 04:10.734
YEAH, WELL, CAPTAIN,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
THE PRESENTS, OK?

04:10.734 --> 04:12.700
THIS IS ABOUT
THE POWER STRUGGLE
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN

04:12.700 --> 04:14.734
SINCE THE CREATION OF MAN
OVER 300 YEARS AGO.

04:14.734 --> 04:17.834
WAIT TILL YOU GUYS SEE
WHAT I HAVE TO PUT
ON TOP OF THAT TREE.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.000
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
OK, OK.
OK. HA HA.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.400
HEY, ANOTHER CONFERENCE.
COME HERE. COME HERE.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.467
WHAT?

04:24.467 --> 04:26.000
WHY ARE YOU LETTING HER
WALK ALL OVER YOU?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.867
SHE IS NOT
WALKING ALL OVER ME.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.133
WATCH, OK?

04:29.133 --> 04:31.800
WHEN SHE COMES DOWNSTAIRS
WITH HER LITTLE ORNAMENT,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.867
I AM GONNA LET HER KNOW
THAT OUR CARDBOARD
NOODLE STAR

04:34.867 --> 04:36.367
IS GOING ON OUR TREE,

04:36.367 --> 04:38.934
OR I'M NOT CAPTAIN
TAKE-ME-SHOPPING.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.133
HI, GUYS.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.600
[PURRS]

04:45.200 --> 04:46.600
HE GUESSED.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.967
IT WAS A GUESS.

04:49.734 --> 04:51.834
WON'T THIS LOOK BEAUTIFUL
ON TOP OF THE TREE?

04:51.834 --> 04:55.600
TOPANGA, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.033
LET ME GUESS.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.600
YOU LOVE THE ANGEL!
OH!

05:00.767 --> 05:02.767
I LOVE THE ANGEL.

05:02.767 --> 05:04.400
I HAVE FAILED.

05:05.567 --> 05:06.600
DUH!

05:06.600 --> 05:08.867
UM, HI. UH, TOPANGA,

05:08.867 --> 05:12.600
ABOUT YOU SPENDING CHRISTMAS
WITH US, THE MATTHEWS,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.000
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.567
ERIC, IF THIS IS ABOUT
THE SPENDING LIMITS
ON PRESENTS,

05:16.567 --> 05:19.967
I'M SORRY. I JUST SAW
SOMETHING THAT WAS SO ERIC,
AND I HAD TO GET IT.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.867
I LOVE YOU.
WELCOME TO OUR FAMILY.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.467
OK, OK.

05:24.567 --> 05:25.867
HELLO.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.300
GREETINGS
OF THE SEASON.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.734
IT'S<i>CHRISTMAS</i>
<i>CAROL </i>TIME.

05:29.734 --> 05:32.000
I LOVE<i>A CHRISTMAS CAROL.</i>

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
YEAH. EVERY YEAR,
MR. FEENY COMES OVER

05:34.000 --> 05:35.300
AND READS IT TO US.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.734
NO ONE
EVER ASKS HIM TO.
HE JUST DOES.

05:37.734 --> 05:39.300
TRADITION.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.000
YOU KNOW WHAT
MIGHT BE FUN?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.834
TRADITION.

05:42.834 --> 05:44.500
WHAT IF INSTEAD OF YOU
JUST READING THE STORY,

05:44.500 --> 05:46.600
WE ALL TOOK PARTS
AND ACTED THEM OUT?

05:53.100 --> 05:56.100
CORY, DID SOMEONE
EXPRESS A PROBLEM

05:56.100 --> 05:57.734
WITH HOW I READ THIS
LAST YEAR?

05:57.734 --> 05:59.100
BECAUSE IF I
WAS A LITTLE SLOW,

05:59.100 --> 06:00.500
I COULD ALWAYS
PICK UP THE PACE.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.734
MORGAN WOULD HAVE A BLAST
PLAYING TINY TIM.

06:02.734 --> 06:03.767
I'M GONNA
GO TELL HER.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.400
BUT I'M TINY TIM.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.600
AND SCROOGE...
AND ALL OF THEM.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.133
I'M SORRY. SHE
LIKES THINGS DONE
HER OWN WAY,

06:12.133 --> 06:15.000
BUT IT'S JUST
ONE TIME OF YEAR,
YOU KNOW?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.834
IT'S NOT
MY WHOLE LIFE.
IT'S JUST...

06:16.834 --> 06:18.100
CHRISTMAS...

06:18.100 --> 06:21.300
AND EVERY MORNING
WHEN SHE TELLS ME
WHAT TO WEAR.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.033
NICE SHIRT.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.834
OK.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.033
SO, JACK,
HOW DO YOU USUALLY
CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS?

06:35.033 --> 06:37.467
WE USUALLY GO TO VAL D'YSSERE
AND SKI THE FRENCH ALPS.

06:37.467 --> 06:39.200
HOW ABOUT YOU?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.400
WELL, THOSE OF US
IN THE TRAILER PARK

06:41.400 --> 06:42.600
JUST LIKE
TO THANK GOD

06:42.600 --> 06:45.100
FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.200
WE PRAY ON THE PLANE.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.667
OK, 2 BROTHERS,
NOT A WHOLE LOT
IN COMMON.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.467
NOTHING ALIKE
WHATSOEVER.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.600
SO HOW SHOULD WE
CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS?

06:55.600 --> 06:57.500
I DON'T THINK IT'S
IMPORTANT WHAT WE DO

06:57.500 --> 06:59.667
AS LONG AS
WE DO IT TOGETHER.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.667
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

07:05.400 --> 07:06.967
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A KID,

07:06.967 --> 07:08.700
I USED TO ALWAYS WONDER
WHAT IT'D BE LIKE

07:08.700 --> 07:11.000
TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS
WITH MY BROTHER.

07:12.133 --> 07:14.000
NOW I'M GONNA
GET THAT CHANCE.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.200
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BEST CHRISTMAS
EVER.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.000
SO...

07:22.000 --> 07:23.600
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.667
CORY...

07:32.667 --> 07:34.200
CORY, WAKE UP.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.133
TOPANGA?

07:42.300 --> 07:43.500
I MEAN, UH--HA--

07:43.500 --> 07:48.900
TOPANGA, YOU
FRISKY LITTLE GIRL,
COME IN.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.000
NO. I'M HERE BECAUSE
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.900
WELL, I THINK YOU NEED
A NICE LITTLE SNUGGLE,

07:53.900 --> 07:55.834
SO COME IN.

07:55.834 --> 07:58.467
NO, I'M NOT HERE TO...
COME IN.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.934
THEN WHY DID
YOU WAKE ME UP?

08:01.934 --> 08:05.400
I WAS WONDERING
WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.100
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING?

08:07.100 --> 08:11.834
I'M--I'M USUALLY SLEEPING
AND DREAMING,

08:11.834 --> 08:14.934
AND IN MY DREAM,
I SAID, "COME IN,"

08:14.934 --> 08:16.600
AND YOU DID.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.967
DON'T YOU EVER WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

08:18.967 --> 08:20.767
NOT ONCE EVER.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.200
WHY?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.800
WELL, TO THINK
ABOUT THINGS.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.600
WHAT SORT OF THINGS
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

08:27.600 --> 08:31.233
LIKE I KNOW
THAT ERIC
LIKES HIS EGGNOG

08:31.233 --> 08:34.400
AND THAT
YOUR FATHER LOVES
HIS ALUMINUM TREE,

08:34.400 --> 08:36.300
AND I KNOW
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

08:36.300 --> 08:38.600
THAT I HAVE
MY TRADITIONS, TOO.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.967
AND YOU'RE OK WITH
THAT, AREN'T YOU?

08:40.967 --> 08:44.667
WELL, YEAH.
I MEAN, WE ALL HAVE
OUR OWN TRADITIONS.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.700
IN FACT,
ONE OF MY FAVORITE

08:46.700 --> 08:49.300
IS SLEEPING
WHEN IT'S DARK.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.400
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
CORY, WE'RE NOT
THE SAME PEOPLE...

08:52.400 --> 08:55.033
AND SOMETIMES
THE WAY THAT
I WOULD DO THINGS

08:55.033 --> 08:59.100
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THAN THE WAY THAT
YOU WOULD DO THINGS.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.000
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.133
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.500
IT'S JUST
GOOD TO KNOW

09:05.500 --> 09:08.400
THAT FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES,

09:08.400 --> 09:10.934
YOU'LL GET UP WITH ME
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING
TO TALK ABOUT THINGS.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.200
GOOD NIGHT.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.500
[DOOR CLOSES]

09:20.500 --> 09:22.300
NOW I'M UP.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.400
DAD, WHAT YOU DOING UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

09:29.400 --> 09:31.300
I'M ALWAYS UP NOW.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.100
HOW COME?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.133
OH, EVERY NIGHT
I JUST WISH

09:35.133 --> 09:36.767
THAT I CAN MAKE IT
TO THE MORNING

09:36.767 --> 09:39.000
WITHOUT THAT
TAP, TAP, TAP.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.400
[IMITATING AMY]
"ALAN, ARE YOU UP?"

09:41.400 --> 09:42.934
