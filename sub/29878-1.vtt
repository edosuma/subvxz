<i>RIP-FIXES-SYNC
by VaVooM</i>

00:31.151 --> 00:32.354
Look at this.

00:32.391 --> 00:33.391
Yes?

00:33.859 --> 00:34.958
Come on, Marianne.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.494
At this rate it'll be new year's
before we get started.

00:37.529 --> 00:40.130
OK.

00:40.799 --> 00:43.867
Merry early Christmas, everyone!

00:43.902 --> 00:45.602
Only two weeks to go!

00:45.637 --> 00:48.038
Ella and I would like to
thank you all for your efforts.

00:48.073 --> 00:52.776
Because of you Dashworks has
had another successful year.

00:55.547 --> 00:57.692
And it wouldn't be fair if
the party planners themselves

00:57.716 --> 01:00.116
didn't get to have a party,
now would it?

01:00.152 --> 01:02.485
Working here has been so much
fun since you came on board.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.555
It was fun before, too.

01:05.591 --> 01:06.489
Yeah.

01:06.525 --> 01:07.624
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07.659 --> 01:09.904
Now we got two Dashwood sisters
for the price of one.

01:09.928 --> 01:12.128
All work and no play has
never been the Dashwood way.

01:12.164 --> 01:14.130
- Right, Mary?
- Right.

01:14.166 --> 01:15.398
Yes.

01:15.434 --> 01:20.170
Work and, like, a little bit of
life balance is very effective.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.206
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

01:23.742 --> 01:24.774
Merry Christmas!

01:31.416 --> 01:32.616
Good morning.

01:34.686 --> 01:37.754
So I have some exciting news.

01:37.789 --> 01:40.390
The Laurent Toy Store Chain
is interested in

01:40.425 --> 01:45.328
carrying Ferris Wheel line
of toys in all of their stores.

01:47.466 --> 01:50.066
The owners will be visiting
our office this week

01:50.102 --> 01:53.203
so I need everybody to be
on their a game.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.373
This could be a really
big deal for us.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.719
Lots of revenue for the company

01:57.743 --> 02:00.677
and bonuses for
our entire staff.

02:00.712 --> 02:03.680
So, get back to work.

02:03.715 --> 02:06.616
And thanks for the extra effort.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.724
How do you think that went?

02:14.760 --> 02:16.404
Honestly, I think they're just
not used to seeing you

02:16.428 --> 02:18.128
as the big boss man yet.

02:18.163 --> 02:20.764
My father's shoes aren't going
to be easy to fill.

02:20.799 --> 02:23.033
I need to make this work
with the Laurents.

02:23.068 --> 02:24.868
And you will.

02:28.006 --> 02:31.107
I just read a post online
about a massive charity gala

02:31.143 --> 02:32.575
that's happening downtown.

02:32.611 --> 02:33.651
That sounds like fun.

02:33.679 --> 02:35.078
You want me to get us tickets?

02:35.113 --> 02:35.946
Sure.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.914
But that's not why
I brought it up.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.417
We could be doing
parties like that.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.497
I think we should submit our
information to the organizers

02:42.521 --> 02:45.755
so they can consider us
for future parties.

02:45.791 --> 02:50.226
Galas like that are way bigger
than our normal events.

02:50.262 --> 02:51.828
Exactly.

02:51.863 --> 02:54.497
We are doing just fine
with our regular clients.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.901
Things are good just the way
that they are.

03:01.606 --> 03:02.439
OK.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.674
What're you doing this weekend?

03:04.710 --> 03:09.446
Besides going over
the Hoffman party details?

03:09.481 --> 03:10.113
I don't know yet.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.081
I've had a few invitations.

03:11.116 --> 03:12.148
I haven't decided.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.619
What about you?

03:16.655 --> 03:19.756
Any big plans with Willoughby?

03:19.791 --> 03:23.126
Uh, ye... uh, well actually...

03:23.161 --> 03:25.261
We're not seeing
each other anymore.

03:25.297 --> 03:26.863
What?!

03:26.898 --> 03:28.198
Are you serious?

03:28.233 --> 03:29.366
When did that happen?

03:29.401 --> 03:30.712
You didn't even mention
that to me!

03:30.736 --> 03:32.035
It's not a big deal.

03:32.070 --> 03:36.439
It's probably for the best.

03:36.475 --> 03:37.507
OK.

03:37.542 --> 03:38.886
Then it is probably for the best

03:38.910 --> 03:40.844
that you put yourself
back out there.

03:40.879 --> 03:43.213
No.

03:43.248 --> 03:47.150
We should totally reactivate
your dating app profile.

03:47.185 --> 03:47.884
No!

03:47.919 --> 03:48.852
Hey, no!

03:48.887 --> 03:50.798
Listen, me and awkward
small talk, that's not...

03:50.822 --> 03:51.788
it's not a thing.

03:51.823 --> 03:54.491
I am... I would rather have a date
with my book.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.060
That way I am guaranteed
to have a good time.

03:57.095 --> 03:58.161
What do you have to lose?

03:58.196 --> 03:59.729
No risk, no reward.

04:01.433 --> 04:04.801
Yeah.

04:04.836 --> 04:09.339
Since when did you take
a risk on somebody?

04:09.374 --> 04:14.144
When I meet someone worth it,
I will.

04:15.414 --> 04:16.379
OK.

04:16.415 --> 04:17.747
Yeah.

04:17.783 --> 04:19.494
Have a good date night
with your book.

04:20.485 --> 04:23.653
I'm sure you two will be
very happy together.

04:43.141 --> 04:44.407
Bye, Brandon!

04:51.383 --> 04:52.383
Hi.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.684
Hi.

04:57.155 --> 04:59.033
Can you believe they put
that on display?

04:59.057 --> 05:00.435
It's really something, isn't it?

05:00.459 --> 05:02.692
Yeah, it's something, alright.

05:02.727 --> 05:04.661
It's utter nonsense.

05:05.797 --> 05:07.430
What?

05:07.466 --> 05:09.532
I think it's super interesting.

05:09.568 --> 05:11.734
You just need to take your time
with it.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.037
Let it speak to you.

05:14.072 --> 05:17.540
It says it looks like something

05:17.576 --> 05:21.010
my assistant's six year old
could paint.

05:21.947 --> 05:25.381
Well, everyone's entitled
to their opinion.

05:25.417 --> 05:29.252
Well, thank you for letting me
have my opinion.

05:36.761 --> 05:38.728
Let me try that again.

05:38.763 --> 05:39.829
OK.

05:39.865 --> 05:41.442
You must be a Christmas
enthusiast.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.899
I am.

05:42.934 --> 05:44.834
'Tis the season and
I can't get enough.

05:44.870 --> 05:48.004
Well, it takes a bold personality
to pull off such a...

05:48.039 --> 05:50.840
A bold accessory.

05:50.876 --> 05:52.942
Thank you.

05:57.115 --> 06:00.183
Your accessory is certainly
making a statement.

06:00.218 --> 06:01.151
It's understated.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.252
Solid.

06:02.287 --> 06:03.620
Ever consider a pattern?

06:03.655 --> 06:07.757
You might try a whimsical tie.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.092
A whimsical tie...

06:09.127 --> 06:10.293
Ella.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.461
You're here.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.562
Great.

06:12.597 --> 06:17.300
It's been solid making
awkward small talk with you.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.903
Have a whimsical afternoon.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.373
You were almost late.

06:23.408 --> 06:25.019
Actually, I told you to come
30 minutes earlier

06:25.043 --> 06:27.210
so you'd have a buffer
to be on time.

06:27.245 --> 06:28.945
Then your strategy worked.

06:28.980 --> 06:29.612
Who's that guy?

06:29.648 --> 06:30.725
I don't know.

06:30.749 --> 06:32.782
Ella and Marianne Dashwood?

06:32.817 --> 06:33.650
Hi.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.918
Hi, I'm Brandon Williams.

06:34.953 --> 06:38.721
I'll be handling the outstanding
matters on your father's estate.

06:38.757 --> 06:40.301
Did you just call us
outstanding?

06:44.062 --> 06:45.695
I'm sorry.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.230
Mari... Marianne.

06:47.265 --> 06:48.965
I'm Williams.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.533
Or... Brandon Williams.

06:50.569 --> 06:51.668
Right.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.748
So the file documents
are upstairs in my office

06:53.772 --> 06:56.539
which will transfer the business
into your names

06:56.575 --> 06:58.808
and once we sign on
the dotted line...

06:58.843 --> 07:01.311
Dashworks will officially and
equally belong to both of you.

07:01.346 --> 07:03.012
Alright, partner.

07:11.957 --> 07:14.524
Sorry to interrupt, boss, but
you have an impromptu visitor.

07:16.761 --> 07:18.261
Dad.

07:18.296 --> 07:19.862
What're you doing here?

07:19.898 --> 07:21.542
Your father's having a little
trouble adjusting

07:21.566 --> 07:22.932
to his retirement.

07:22.968 --> 07:25.435
Mom, you look beautiful.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.904
I like what you've done
to my office, son.

07:27.939 --> 07:31.374
I mean, your office.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.276
So, when do the Laurents
get to town?

07:33.311 --> 07:34.311
This weekend.

07:34.346 --> 07:37.247
Good. This deal will be quite
the coup for us.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.093
It's a chance for the company
to finally break in

07:39.117 --> 07:39.983
to the European market.

07:40.018 --> 07:42.585
I'm sure Edward knows
what he's doing.

07:42.621 --> 07:43.653
I hope so.

07:43.688 --> 07:46.055
The board is counting on you
to make this happen.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.269
Well, in fact, I've been putting
a report together

07:48.293 --> 07:52.795
and I think that you will be
very impressed with the numbers.

07:52.831 --> 07:55.565
This will be very important,
but when I started negotiations

07:55.600 --> 07:57.979
with the Laurents they made it
clear they make their decisions

07:58.003 --> 08:01.904
based on gut feelings,
not statistics.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.841
You'll need to appeal to them
on a personal level.

08:06.811 --> 08:07.944
OK, Lloyd.

08:07.979 --> 08:10.913
I think you've had your fill
of shop talk for the day.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.448
Will we see you on Christmas?

08:12.484 --> 08:14.117
Yeah, sure.

08:14.152 --> 08:16.286
If I can get away
from the office.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.021
Thanks for dropping by.

08:19.424 --> 08:20.690
Bye.

08:25.764 --> 08:27.630
We can do anything
with Dashworks.

08:27.666 --> 08:30.099
We don't have to play it
so safe anymore.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.769
I think it's time that we grow.

08:32.804 --> 08:33.970
Change.

08:34.005 --> 08:35.104
Evolve.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.339
Develop.

08:36.374 --> 08:37.073
Flourish.

08:37.107 --> 08:41.110
I respect all of
your vocabulary,

08:41.145 --> 08:45.348
but do you actually know what
growing Dashworks would entail?

08:45.383 --> 08:47.083
Yes, I do.

08:47.118 --> 08:50.019
It means taking on bigger
scale events for larger clients.

08:50.055 --> 08:50.953
Yes, right.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.600
But that would require a lot
more steps.

08:52.624 --> 08:54.924
Like, we would have to hire
more staff.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.593
Put more resources
into marketing.

08:57.629 --> 08:58.761
Get a bank loan.

08:58.797 --> 08:59.996
Great.

09:00.031 --> 09:01.497
Let's do it!

09:01.533 --> 09:03.299
You haven't thought
all this through.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.968
If we want to dream big
we have to aim big.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.782
Can we please just focus on
the projects

09:07.806 --> 09:09.839
that we've been commissioned
for right now

09:09.874 --> 09:11.952
before thinking about the future
of our business?

09:11.976 --> 09:13.476
If you insist.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.612
Thank you.

09:16.648 --> 09:18.292
How's the apartment
searching going?

09:18.316 --> 09:20.983
I've seen so many but
none of them are quite right.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.120
Besides, they all require
a minimum year lease.

09:24.155 --> 09:26.122
Maybe you just need to commit.

09:26.157 --> 09:30.526
Or maybe you just don't want me
crashing at your house anymore.

09:30.562 --> 09:33.563
You can stay with me
as long as you want,

09:33.598 --> 09:36.065
but you have been in Chicago
for almost a year now

09:36.101 --> 09:38.201
and you're still living
out of your suitcase.

09:38.236 --> 09:41.604
You call it my suitcase,
I call it my closet.

09:46.010 --> 09:47.176
Thank you.

09:49.581 --> 09:50.913
Boss.

09:50.949 --> 09:51.881
Charlotte.

09:51.916 --> 09:52.982
I've been looking for you.

09:53.017 --> 09:54.517
This just arrived at the office.

09:57.122 --> 10:00.089
"Once considered the gold
standard in toy innovation,

10:00.125 --> 10:02.525
"Ferris Wheel Toys is
under new management

10:02.560 --> 10:04.827
"and struggling to spin its way

10:04.863 --> 10:08.965
"towards its usual success
this season"?

10:10.468 --> 10:11.534
Who's that?

10:11.569 --> 10:15.605
That is the incredibly
obnoxious guy I met yesterday

10:15.640 --> 10:19.375
who is apparently the CEO
of Ferris Wheel Toys.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.011
"While Edward David Ferris
no doubt has a mind for data,

10:22.046 --> 10:23.579
"it's hard to imagine a young,

10:23.615 --> 10:26.082
"playful boy who grew up
surrounded by toys.

10:26.117 --> 10:28.451
"Since Ferris's appointment
as CEO stock prices have

10:28.486 --> 10:31.888
"already begun to drop due to
concerns about his leadership."

10:31.923 --> 10:33.689
Sounds about right.

10:36.394 --> 10:38.694
You have to admit,
he's kinda cute.

10:39.964 --> 10:43.032
Uptight and smug
isn't exactly my type.

10:55.947 --> 10:59.916
Mr. and Mrs. Laurent.
Hi!

11:01.953 --> 11:03.453
May I introduce Lucy Steele,

11:03.488 --> 11:05.755
our vice president
of production.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.391
Delighted to meet you at last.

11:08.426 --> 11:10.560
It's our first time
in your city.

11:10.595 --> 11:13.062
And we want to do everything.

11:13.097 --> 11:15.431
Especially all the festive
activities.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.966
<i>Festive.</i>

11:17.001 --> 11:19.469
We simply love
this time of year.

11:19.504 --> 11:20.815
Well, then you should
definitely check out

11:20.839 --> 11:22.249
the tree lighting
tomorrow night.

11:22.273 --> 11:23.372
Great idea.

11:23.408 --> 11:27.477
Vivienne and I have been doing
all kinds of research for our trip.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.012
This was a very
enlightening read.

11:30.048 --> 11:31.214
Ah, yes.

11:31.249 --> 11:34.450
I was... I was very nervous
during that interview

11:34.486 --> 11:37.520
but hopefully you'll get
to know me a little better

11:37.555 --> 11:39.088
over your time here.

11:39.123 --> 11:40.089
Of course.

11:40.124 --> 11:42.325
We are looking forward
to getting acquainted.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.861
Yes, and there will be
ample time for that.

11:44.896 --> 11:50.933
Ample time for that
because we are...

11:50.969 --> 11:53.135
...having

11:53.171 --> 11:54.303
...a party!

11:55.406 --> 11:56.305
We are?

11:56.341 --> 11:57.139
Yes.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.641
When?

11:58.676 --> 11:59.842
On the 23rd!

12:02.514 --> 12:03.579
How wonderful!

12:03.615 --> 12:06.649
Well, we would love to show you
around our offices,

12:06.684 --> 12:08.451
so right this way.

12:08.486 --> 12:10.453
Oh, merci.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.123
You have time to throw a party?

12:14.158 --> 12:15.158
Of course.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.959
How hard can it be?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.069
Final checklist for Mrs.
Hoffman's pre-show party.

12:27.105 --> 12:28.337
Venue.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.805
You're looking at it.

12:29.841 --> 12:30.907
It's so cool.

12:30.942 --> 12:32.041
I love the nutcracker.

12:32.076 --> 12:32.975
Me too.

12:33.011 --> 12:35.378
OK, catering?

12:35.413 --> 12:36.490
Already prepping in the back.

12:36.514 --> 12:39.215
The first wave of appetizers
will be out by 6:00pm.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.216
Decorations?

12:40.251 --> 12:42.518
They're all formed
from pieces from the set

12:42.554 --> 12:44.420
and already in place.

12:44.455 --> 12:45.488
Music?

12:47.559 --> 12:49.091
Who's on music?

12:49.127 --> 12:50.026
Oh, sorry.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.994
The string quartet.

12:52.030 --> 12:54.430
What time are they arriving?

12:54.465 --> 12:55.264
Normal time?

12:55.300 --> 12:56.844
I told them the party starts
at 6:00

12:56.868 --> 13:00.036
have you talked
to their manager?

13:00.071 --> 13:02.672
Where's their contract?

13:02.707 --> 13:05.408
I thought you dealt
with that part.

13:06.277 --> 13:08.210
I'm on the phone with them.

13:12.717 --> 13:15.451
And you want to plan
bigger events?

13:15.486 --> 13:16.852
I...

13:16.888 --> 13:18.387
They're not coming.

13:20.325 --> 13:22.959
We can find a replacement.

13:22.994 --> 13:26.162
You mean I can find
a replacement.

13:36.741 --> 13:38.140
It's gorgeous.

13:38.176 --> 13:39.408
So beautiful.

13:42.513 --> 13:43.946
This way.

13:44.349 --> 13:47.583
Marianne, Marianne.
Mrs. Hoffman was just saying

13:47.619 --> 13:49.919
how much everyone has been
enjoying the party.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.122
It's true, you have put on
quite the soiree.

13:53.157 --> 13:57.259
And the speech Ella prepared
for me received huge applause.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.060
So, thank you.

13:58.096 --> 14:00.062
Thank you so much
for everything.

14:00.098 --> 14:02.398
Oh, well it's our pleasure.

14:05.203 --> 14:06.435
See?

14:06.471 --> 14:09.939
Everything worked out,
just like always.

14:09.974 --> 14:16.045
Well, thank goodness John had
classical music on his phone.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.150
You OK?

14:21.185 --> 14:23.419
She always forgives me.

14:24.389 --> 14:27.657
But this time I have to come up
with a way to make it up to her.

14:33.965 --> 14:36.143
<i>If all goes well I think this
might actually go to trial.</i>

14:36.167 --> 14:37.366
<i>It's pretty exciting.</i>

14:37.402 --> 14:38.946
<i>That is super exciting and
I want to hear all about it,</i>

14:38.970 --> 14:41.270
<i>but first I need your help.</i>

14:41.305 --> 14:42.471
<i>Right, yeah.</i>

14:42.507 --> 14:45.041
<i>You said on the phone something
about a party emergency?</i>

14:45.076 --> 14:46.987
<i>Yeah, I'm throwing a party
for 100 people.</i>

14:47.011 --> 14:49.445
<i>OK, and how do I fit into it?</i>

14:49.480 --> 14:51.480
<i>You threw a party for your firm.</i>

14:51.516 --> 14:52.348
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

14:52.383 --> 14:54.161
<i>I hired a professional
party planner.</i>

14:54.185 --> 14:55.295
<i>I mean, that's what you need.</i>

14:55.319 --> 14:57.720
<i>Yeah, but everybody recommended
to me is booked, so...</i>

14:57.755 --> 14:58.788
not everybody.

14:58.823 --> 15:00.356
I could plan...

15:01.025 --> 15:02.458
It's you.

15:03.661 --> 15:04.794
Never mind.

15:04.829 --> 15:07.496
Eavesdropping on conversations?

15:07.532 --> 15:08.532
Ella.

15:08.566 --> 15:09.632
Brandon.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.667
You know my cousin, Edward?

15:13.004 --> 15:14.537
<i>Not exactly.</i>

15:14.572 --> 15:17.573
We had one awkward conversation.

15:17.608 --> 15:19.753
Well, today's your lucky day
because Ella and her sister

15:19.777 --> 15:21.210
are party planners.

15:24.582 --> 15:25.815
Well, when's the event?

15:25.850 --> 15:26.916
The 23rd.

15:26.951 --> 15:29.919
That's only, what,
nine days away?

15:29.954 --> 15:33.089
Do you think Dashworks has the
bandwidth to take on another...

15:33.124 --> 15:34.401
I really don't think
that's necessary.

15:34.425 --> 15:35.391
That's not a good idea.

15:35.426 --> 15:36.926
I mean, I can do it myself.

15:36.961 --> 15:38.861
It's not like
it's rocket science.

15:39.464 --> 15:40.429
Sure.

15:40.465 --> 15:44.200
It's just a teeny, tiny,
100 person gathering.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.468
You know what you should do?

15:45.503 --> 15:48.537
You should enlist the help
of your assistant's six year old.

15:48.573 --> 15:52.575
I'm sure he knows all about
guest lists and food allergies

15:52.610 --> 15:56.512
and good luck to you,
you're gonna need it.

15:57.115 --> 15:58.180
Edward, don't be absurd.

15:58.216 --> 16:00.416
<i>Things at Ferris Wheel
are of a certain calibre.</i>

16:00.451 --> 16:03.552
<i>Think of the company's
reputation.</i>

16:03.588 --> 16:04.665
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:04.689 --> 16:07.923
Did you just say it was a Ferris
Wheel company party?

16:07.959 --> 16:11.460
Yes, it's the first time
we're throwing such an event.

16:11.496 --> 16:12.528
You know what?

16:12.563 --> 16:15.564
I'm sure we can find space
for you on our calendar.

16:20.004 --> 16:21.237
OK.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.605
Forget it.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.940
Looks like you've got it
all figured out.

16:24.976 --> 16:26.675
I'll see you later, Brandon.

16:27.645 --> 16:29.145
Wait.

16:29.180 --> 16:32.214
If you would be willing,
I'd like to hire you.

16:32.250 --> 16:36.952
You can charge me
whatever is fair.

16:36.988 --> 16:38.888
Then we have a deal.

16:49.935 --> 16:50.834
Morning.

16:50.869 --> 16:53.603
I am so sorry about
all of the confusion

16:53.639 --> 16:55.438
with the quartet last night.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.574
I'm sorry.

16:57.609 --> 16:59.676
Forgetting to dot your i's
and cross your t's

16:59.711 --> 17:05.448
isn't exactly what I would call,
you know, confusion, but OK.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.249
You're right.

17:06.285 --> 17:07.929
I will be more organized
next time.

17:09.288 --> 17:11.154
What're you working on?

17:12.491 --> 17:15.892
Hypothetically speaking,
if you needed to book

17:15.928 --> 17:23.066
a large venue for December 23rd
where would you start?

17:23.101 --> 17:27.637
Well, hypothetically speaking I
would have started months ago.

17:27.673 --> 17:28.939
Why?

17:28.974 --> 17:33.243
Because we have a major
new client.

17:33.278 --> 17:34.177
What?

17:34.213 --> 17:38.148
Brandon's cousin runs
Ferris Wheel Toys.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.883
As in the Ferris Fair.

17:39.918 --> 17:42.919
And we are going to be doing
his big holiday party.

17:42.955 --> 17:44.087
Isn't that great?

17:44.122 --> 17:45.555
We aren't doing anything.

17:45.591 --> 17:46.890
No. No.

17:46.925 --> 17:48.058
We are too busy.

17:48.093 --> 17:49.726
You call.

17:49.761 --> 17:50.660
Call him right now.

17:50.696 --> 17:51.995
You have to cancel.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.129
Cancel?

17:53.165 --> 17:54.130
Yes!

17:54.166 --> 17:55.065
We... look, just because this fell
into your lap

17:55.100 --> 17:56.900
doesn't mean that
it's a good idea, OK?

17:56.935 --> 17:58.134
Honey...

17:58.170 --> 18:01.037
give me a chance to make up
for the mistakes of last night.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.307
Please?

18:04.343 --> 18:05.408
What is that?

18:05.444 --> 18:06.676
Really?

18:09.181 --> 18:10.013
Fine.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.147
But you need to focus.

18:11.183 --> 18:16.353
Like, I mean focussing the most
you've ever focussed.

18:16.388 --> 18:17.787
I will not let you down.

18:17.823 --> 18:19.022
Fine.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.624
Call the Wabash reception hall.

18:20.659 --> 18:23.159
I think they just opened up
after renovations.

18:23.195 --> 18:26.029
They've got this beautiful
stained glass ceiling.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.831
They may have availability.

18:27.866 --> 18:29.933
Thank you.

18:34.172 --> 18:35.105
He'll be right in.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.941
I'm Charlotte, Edward's
executive assistant.

18:37.976 --> 18:39.654
You're the one
with the six year old.

18:39.678 --> 18:40.810
Yes, Thomas.

18:40.846 --> 18:42.178
He's a handful.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.214
Oh, my goodness!

18:44.249 --> 18:47.384
Is that an original Ferris bear?

18:47.419 --> 18:49.786
It's just like the one
I had as a kid.

18:49.821 --> 18:51.554
Just as cuddly, too.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.523
It's really a shame
they discontinued these.

18:53.558 --> 18:56.860
Well, the data said he wasn't
marketable anymore.

18:59.498 --> 19:01.498
Welcome to Ferris Wheel.

19:03.001 --> 19:06.136
So do you buy those scarves
in bulk?

19:07.339 --> 19:09.651
Would you like me to get you
one next time I place an order?

19:09.675 --> 19:13.310
I'm thinking beige with beige
accents, perhaps?

19:15.180 --> 19:16.546
Shall we make a to-do list?

19:16.581 --> 19:19.716
Actually, I've brought along
Marianne's trademark

19:19.751 --> 19:21.184
party planning checklist.

19:21.219 --> 19:24.654
It's the gateway for a perfect,
problem-free party.

19:24.690 --> 19:25.555
Fantastic.

19:25.590 --> 19:26.523
Where should we start?

19:26.558 --> 19:27.757
Venue.

19:27.793 --> 19:28.903
We're only eight days out so
there aren't a lot of options

19:28.927 --> 19:31.494
but we can check out the Wabash
reception hall today.

19:31.530 --> 19:33.196
OK, well that sounds suitable.

19:33.231 --> 19:36.232
It's just important that
this feels polished.

19:36.268 --> 19:37.534
Isn't this a Toy Company?

19:37.569 --> 19:40.036
Well, what did you have in mind?

19:40.072 --> 19:44.240
Something a tad more festive?

19:44.276 --> 19:47.243
Nothing major, it'll still be
refined and elegant.

19:47.279 --> 19:49.512
You did say the Laurents
love the holidays.

19:49.548 --> 19:50.847
True.

19:53.819 --> 19:57.187
OK, as long as it still
feels sophisticated.

19:57.222 --> 19:58.021
Great.

19:58.056 --> 19:59.289
And I was also thinking

19:59.324 --> 20:02.993
maybe you and your executives
could do a choreographed dance.

20:04.730 --> 20:07.130
Oh, no.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.265
So we'll table that.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.102
Maybe we could circle back.

20:27.652 --> 20:28.551
Hey.

20:28.587 --> 20:29.819
Hi.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.266
Sorry to pop in unannounced,
I was just in the area so I...

20:32.290 --> 20:33.957
What's up?

20:33.992 --> 20:35.992
What's up?
Right.

20:36.028 --> 20:36.926
So I brought by
the notarized copies

20:36.962 --> 20:38.928
of the documents you signed
so they're...

20:41.466 --> 20:42.265
Thank you.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.099
Elf down.

20:43.135 --> 20:45.201
Yeah.

20:45.604 --> 20:47.237
Thank you.

20:47.272 --> 20:51.975
Yeah, I've never met a file
that I didn't wanna file.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.321
Sorry, that was supposed
to be funny.

20:53.345 --> 20:54.244
I...

20:54.279 --> 20:55.345
No, that's funny.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.513
You're funny.

20:56.548 --> 20:57.548
Is that normal?

20:58.417 --> 21:00.283
I mean, for a lawyer
to make a house call...

21:00.318 --> 21:01.618
I mean, an office call?

21:01.653 --> 21:03.820
We're in an office, we're here.

21:03.855 --> 21:08.191
Yeah, I usually courier them but
I was in the area and I just

21:08.226 --> 21:12.595
wanted to see you...
Have the documents.

21:12.631 --> 21:14.597
So... mission accomplished.

21:16.168 --> 21:17.333
Yeah.

21:17.369 --> 21:18.968
- OK.
- What's that?

21:19.004 --> 21:21.604
- What?
- I thought you said something.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.506
- Like, thank you for these.
- Oh, yes.

21:23.542 --> 21:26.142
You're welcome.
I'm going. Thank you.

21:26.178 --> 21:27.610
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:33.485 --> 21:36.453
So have you worked
at Ferris Wheel long?

21:36.488 --> 21:37.353
Forever.

21:37.389 --> 21:40.657
I started interning
when I was a kid.

21:40.692 --> 21:43.193
So you weren't always
the big man on campus?

21:43.228 --> 21:44.661
No, hardly.

21:44.696 --> 21:46.207
My dad felt it was important
that I work

21:46.231 --> 21:49.666
my way up the ladder, not just
be handed the reins.

21:49.701 --> 21:51.568
That's admirable.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.681
But you never wanted to try
something different?

21:53.705 --> 21:54.637
No.

21:54.673 --> 21:55.839
Honestly.

21:55.874 --> 21:58.186
I mean, my parents didn't demand
I take over Ferris Wheel.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.742
It's what I wanted.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.645
I got my MBA and that was that.

22:02.681 --> 22:06.149
You really are the opposite
of a risk taker.

22:06.184 --> 22:08.384
You say that
with such authority.

22:08.420 --> 22:12.021
Let's just say I've tried
a few careers on for size.

22:12.057 --> 22:13.334
I think it's important
to challenge yourself

22:13.358 --> 22:14.557
with new experiences.

22:14.593 --> 22:15.758
Yes.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.895
There's something exciting
about jumping from job to job,

22:18.930 --> 22:22.398
but there's also something
to be said for stability.

22:22.434 --> 22:24.834
And there's something to be
said for refusing to stagnate.

22:24.870 --> 22:27.337
That's why I want to
revitalize Dashworks.

22:27.372 --> 22:29.105
How long have you worked there?

22:29.141 --> 22:30.518
Here and there
over the past few years,

22:30.542 --> 22:32.942
but full time just
after the new year.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.210
That's not very long.

22:34.246 --> 22:35.523
Are you sure that you're
up for this...

22:35.547 --> 22:37.714
Yes, I am.

22:37.749 --> 22:40.016
Party planning is in my blood.

22:40.051 --> 22:41.584
If you say so.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.927
The venue provides the skeleton
and we are responsible

22:50.962 --> 22:54.797
for bringing in the catering,
decor and entertainment.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.667
Well, this is...
this is so involved.

23:02.674 --> 23:06.209
Now, the first order of business
is deciding on a theme.

23:06.244 --> 23:08.478
Obviously Christmas.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.914
Christmas is the occasion.

23:10.949 --> 23:15.952
A theme could be a masquerade
ball, winter wonderland,

23:15.987 --> 23:18.087
ugly sweater party...

23:18.123 --> 23:21.891
I think we could do
winter wonderland.

23:21.927 --> 23:23.626
Typical.

23:24.296 --> 23:25.740
What's wrong with
winter wonderland?

23:25.764 --> 23:27.108
You're the one that put it
on the list.

23:27.132 --> 23:30.400
I was just providing my client
with options.

23:30.435 --> 23:31.634
That's my job.

23:31.670 --> 23:34.571
Winter wonderland
is a fine idea.

23:34.606 --> 23:36.973
But you wouldn't choose it.

23:39.678 --> 23:42.478
Why don't you tell me what
Christmas means to you?

23:42.514 --> 23:44.480
It'll help us brainstorm.

23:44.516 --> 23:46.482
How do you normally celebrate?

23:46.518 --> 23:50.420
Well, this year it's about
the party.

23:50.455 --> 23:53.256
Right, but that's for work.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.959
What do you do for
your personal celebration?

23:56.394 --> 23:57.460
I don't celebrate.

23:57.495 --> 23:59.762
The season is about completing

23:59.798 --> 24:02.699
a statistical review of my year.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.867
What do you give for gifts?

24:04.903 --> 24:07.570
- Spreadsheets?
- Actually, yes.

24:07.606 --> 24:09.505
I give my father
a financial ledger.

24:09.541 --> 24:11.374
It's a tradition I plan
on continuing

24:11.409 --> 24:13.943
even though he is retired.

24:13.979 --> 24:15.378
Good grief, I was joking.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.380
What do you do for Christmas?

24:17.415 --> 24:19.048
Well, I celebrate.

24:19.084 --> 24:21.017
The Dashwoods go all out.

24:21.052 --> 24:25.154
We leave cookies for Santa,
we tell Yuletide stories,

24:25.190 --> 24:26.856
we build gingerbread houses.

24:26.891 --> 24:30.860
And on Christmas morning there
is an explosion of presents.

24:30.895 --> 24:33.229
That's a little juvenile.

24:33.265 --> 24:34.330
Juvenile?

24:34.366 --> 24:40.903
There is no age limit
on Christmas Spirit, Edward.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.672
We're getting off track.

24:42.707 --> 24:44.540
Winter wonderland it is.

24:44.576 --> 24:47.310
But perhaps you will consider
some glitter,

24:47.345 --> 24:49.345
maybe a pop of colour?

24:50.915 --> 24:51.881
Fine.

24:51.916 --> 24:54.417
No glitter.

24:54.452 --> 24:57.387
One colour.

24:59.724 --> 25:01.157
Maybe two?

25:06.165 --> 25:08.499
<i>- How's the planning going?
- Great!</i>

25:08.534 --> 25:11.635
<i>- And I'm using your checklist.
- You are?</i>

25:11.671 --> 25:13.003
Yes.

25:15.841 --> 25:18.275
It looks amazing!

25:20.146 --> 25:21.478
Hi.

25:21.514 --> 25:23.515
Brandon.
Hi.

25:23.549 --> 25:25.215
We brought treats.

25:25.251 --> 25:27.017
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:27.053 --> 25:29.286
Marianne, meet my cousin,
Edward.

25:29.322 --> 25:31.889
The other half of
the dynamic Dashwood duo.

25:31.924 --> 25:32.956
Yes.

25:32.992 --> 25:34.325
So what are you doing here?

25:34.360 --> 25:36.827
Did you get lost on the way
to the boardroom?

25:36.862 --> 25:39.997
Well, the Laurents are here
so I am here.

25:40.032 --> 25:43.534
What does one do here?
What's the objective?

25:43.569 --> 25:44.468
Well, this is it.

25:44.503 --> 25:48.839
We're hanging out,
having a tasty beverage.

25:48.874 --> 25:51.242
- It's called merriment.
- That's it.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.711
Do you wanna check out the tree?

25:54.513 --> 25:55.879
- Enjoy.
- Yeah.

25:58.017 --> 25:59.483
Oh, darn it.

25:59.518 --> 26:01.085
What's the matter, Edward?

26:01.120 --> 26:02.564
Are you gonna turn into
a pie chart

26:02.588 --> 26:05.389
if we're here past 9:00pm?

26:05.424 --> 26:06.690
<i>Edward!</i>

26:06.726 --> 26:09.660
- You're here.
- Yes, hi.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.428
<i>Isn't this magnificent?</i>

26:11.464 --> 26:14.531
It isn't even lit yet.
Hi. I'm Ella.

26:14.567 --> 26:16.100
Ella is helping with the party.

26:16.135 --> 26:19.603
What do you recommend for us
this evening?

26:19.638 --> 26:21.071
How about...

26:21.107 --> 26:25.676
This is Chicago's hub
for all things holiday.

26:25.711 --> 26:29.046
Right over there,
there is an amazing craft...

26:29.081 --> 26:30.114
Market.

26:30.149 --> 26:33.417
And there are loads of booths
with very tasty...

26:33.452 --> 26:36.019
Treats.
Treats and drinks.

26:36.055 --> 26:38.021
And we'd be happy
to show you around

26:38.057 --> 26:40.224
just as soon as
they've lit the...

26:40.259 --> 26:41.792
Tree. Tree.

26:41.827 --> 26:43.927
Alright.
Allez.

26:46.098 --> 26:48.232
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:50.636 --> 26:59.042
<i>...Eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.</i>

27:04.483 --> 27:06.049
Magnifique!

27:06.085 --> 27:07.518
Bravo! Bravo!

27:25.137 --> 27:26.270
Hi.

27:26.872 --> 27:28.839
Are you the new intern?

27:28.874 --> 27:29.706
<i>Do you wanna have a race?</i>

27:29.742 --> 27:32.342
<i>- Yes, please.
- Here's your car.</i>

27:32.378 --> 27:34.011
There you are, Thomas.

27:34.046 --> 27:34.978
I'm so sorry, boss.

27:35.014 --> 27:36.858
My babysitter cancelled
at the last minute.

27:36.882 --> 27:38.182
It's no problem.

27:38.217 --> 27:39.750
Come on, let's go.

27:40.653 --> 27:41.852
Bye, Thomas.

27:41.887 --> 27:42.986
Bye.

27:44.457 --> 27:45.589
Wanna play?

27:45.624 --> 27:47.024
Got an extra truck.

27:47.059 --> 27:47.891
No.

27:47.927 --> 27:51.829
I have to review
these financial reports.

27:51.864 --> 27:54.631
Don't you have an accounting
department to handle that?

27:54.667 --> 27:55.599
Yes, of course,

27:55.634 --> 27:59.169
but I'm in charge so
the buck stops with me.

27:59.205 --> 28:00.816
Must be the same
with your sister and you.

28:00.840 --> 28:05.042
Actually, in our case Marianne
handles most of the bucks.

28:05.077 --> 28:06.788
Right. Well, I have to ensure
that everything

28:06.812 --> 28:07.444
is done correctly.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.880
This is a major Toy Company.

28:09.915 --> 28:12.583
It's not just fun and games.

28:13.219 --> 28:14.518
Hello.

28:14.553 --> 28:15.285
Am I interrupting?

28:15.321 --> 28:17.187
Ella Dashwood, meet Lucy Steele.

28:17.223 --> 28:18.956
She's one of our
senior executives.

28:18.991 --> 28:20.991
Oh, you're Ella.
It's nice to meet you.

28:21.026 --> 28:21.725
You too.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.861
- So is there more party to plan?
- Yes.

28:23.896 --> 28:26.897
We're conquering invitations
and menus.

28:26.932 --> 28:29.533
I sent you figures
on the new truck design.

28:29.568 --> 28:30.601
Is it viable?

28:30.636 --> 28:32.970
Well, if we reduce mobility
by just five percent

28:33.005 --> 28:35.038
it could mean big savings
at the factory.

28:35.074 --> 28:37.875
OK, I wanna run those numbers
past my dad, get his opinion.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.142
OK.

28:39.178 --> 28:41.678
I should run but I'm really
looking forward to the party.

28:41.714 --> 28:44.047
I don't think that we've been
to a formal event together

28:44.083 --> 28:45.983
since we were prom dates.

28:46.919 --> 28:48.118
That's true.

28:49.722 --> 28:51.054
Well, shall we?

28:54.226 --> 28:56.226
So with the event
only seven days away

28:56.261 --> 28:58.328
we'll have to send out
the invitations online.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.297
Understood, but disappointing.

29:00.332 --> 29:02.410
I put together some templates
for you to have a look at.

29:02.434 --> 29:06.002
I know how much you value
deliberate decision making.

29:06.038 --> 29:07.204
Thank you.

29:07.239 --> 29:10.340
We can still free flow some
additional ideas, I'm sure.

29:11.109 --> 29:13.410
- Have a look.
- Too busy.

29:13.445 --> 29:14.845
I assumed so.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.347
But maybe one day
you'll surprise me.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.486
I thought we were checking
out caterers.

29:23.522 --> 29:26.056
Well, traditional catering
can be so stale.

29:26.091 --> 29:27.091
Figuratively speaking.

29:27.125 --> 29:28.491
I'm sure the food is fresh.

29:28.527 --> 29:31.361
So we are going to go
with Francesco's.

29:31.396 --> 29:33.107
I already know you like
the food.

29:33.131 --> 29:34.509
Are you sure a restaurant
this size

29:34.533 --> 29:36.166
can handle such a large order?

29:36.201 --> 29:38.735
Francesco has been begging
for opportunities to branch out.

29:38.770 --> 29:42.272
Besides, if anything goes wrong
we'll just order pizzas.

29:42.307 --> 29:43.440
I'm joking.

29:43.475 --> 29:45.575
Edward, take a chance
and trust me.

29:45.611 --> 29:48.278
Look, they've prepared
such beautiful samples.

29:48.313 --> 29:50.814
We'll see what appeals to you
and then place the order.

29:56.555 --> 29:59.789
Seems someone is feeling
the Christmas Spirit.

29:59.825 --> 30:02.926
No, I'm simply finding the need
for nutrition,

30:02.961 --> 30:05.362
not the need for celebration.

30:05.397 --> 30:07.075
You really don't like
celebrating, do you?

30:07.099 --> 30:09.399
It's not that I'm opposed
to celebration in principle,

30:09.434 --> 30:13.436
it's just... it's very busy
for us at Ferris Wheel.

30:13.472 --> 30:15.772
I'll visit my parents at
Christmas if there's time.

30:15.807 --> 30:17.807
You know, Marianne and I
are busy, too,

30:17.843 --> 30:19.542
but we make time for the season.

30:20.679 --> 30:22.245
Especially now
that it's just us.

30:24.483 --> 30:27.550
What I wouldn't give for one
more Christmas with our parents.

30:30.656 --> 30:32.088
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

30:32.124 --> 30:34.724
I shouldn't have gotten
that sentimental.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.426
This is supposed to be cheerful.

30:36.461 --> 30:40.463
Here, why don't you try
the escargot?

30:42.534 --> 30:43.800
Escargot?

30:45.504 --> 30:46.937
Ladies first.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.572
I've had it.
In France.

30:49.608 --> 30:50.608
Delish.

30:52.277 --> 30:54.444
I don't think I'm
an escargot kinda guy.

30:54.479 --> 30:57.213
Come on, Edward.
Live a little.

30:59.618 --> 31:01.117
I'm good with crab cakes.

31:02.154 --> 31:03.553
What else is there?

31:10.629 --> 31:12.128
- This one?
- That one.

31:12.164 --> 31:12.829
Great.

31:12.864 --> 31:15.131
Guys, this looks really great.

31:15.167 --> 31:16.599
Yeah.

31:16.635 --> 31:18.068
<i>There she is.</i>

31:19.037 --> 31:19.536
Hi.

31:19.571 --> 31:20.637
<i>Hi.</i>

31:20.672 --> 31:22.505
Hello, Edward.
How's the planning going?

31:22.541 --> 31:23.807
So far, so good.

31:23.842 --> 31:27.177
Ella has been very patient
with me.

31:27.212 --> 31:29.679
So the checklist says
that tomorrow is decor

31:29.715 --> 31:31.693
so I thought I'd bring Edward by
to show him

31:31.717 --> 31:33.283
what Dashworks can accomplish.

31:33.318 --> 31:35.196
Speaking of checklist
I should go over that.

31:35.220 --> 31:36.052
Thank you.

31:36.088 --> 31:38.555
And I'll leave you two
to look around.

31:42.494 --> 31:45.395
So, what do you think?

31:45.430 --> 31:47.097
It's fantastic.

31:48.233 --> 31:53.370
So I invited the Laurents
over tomorrow for cocktails.

31:53.405 --> 31:55.416
It's important that I build
a relationship with them,

31:55.440 --> 31:57.707
you know, to help
with our rapport.

31:57.743 --> 32:00.477
Did you want some suggestions
on what to serve?

32:00.512 --> 32:01.378
No. No.

32:01.413 --> 32:03.013
Food is all taken care of.

32:03.048 --> 32:07.384
It's just that my house
is so un-festive and...

32:07.419 --> 32:09.285
Well, I was wondering if...

32:10.689 --> 32:12.655
Edward, are you trying to ask

32:12.691 --> 32:15.725
if I'd help you decorate
your home?

32:15.761 --> 32:17.372
I know that you are
incredibly busy

32:17.396 --> 32:19.007
and I, of course, would pay you
for your time.

32:19.031 --> 32:19.696
I would love to.

32:19.731 --> 32:21.531
And please consider it a gift.

32:21.566 --> 32:25.702
- Thank you very, very much.
- You're welcome very much.

32:27.539 --> 32:28.750
You know, I've been thinking
about that painting

32:28.774 --> 32:30.106
in Brandon's office.

32:30.142 --> 32:31.908
And?

32:31.943 --> 32:33.743
I still hate it.

32:43.569 --> 32:45.329
You're helping Edward,
do what?

32:46.089 --> 32:47.856
Decorate.

32:47.891 --> 32:49.324
Doesn't that sound fun?

32:49.359 --> 32:50.359
Yeah.

32:50.393 --> 32:52.438
What, you're already bored
with party planning?

32:52.462 --> 32:53.595
No, not at all.

32:53.630 --> 32:57.065
I just thought this was an
extra service we could offer

32:57.100 --> 32:59.234
as part of the expansion plan.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.235
Right.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.104
Yeah, your idea is to sort of
grow Dashworks.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.206
I tried to explain it
to Brandon.

33:05.242 --> 33:08.042
OK, I know you're annoyed
with me but can you please,

33:08.078 --> 33:13.782
please talk about your massive
crush on Brandon?

33:13.817 --> 33:15.350
Yeah, OK.

33:16.386 --> 33:17.386
That's ridiculous.

33:18.255 --> 33:19.699
That's not even a...
it's not even a thing.

33:19.723 --> 33:20.755
Not at all.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.690
It's a weird... that's... no.

33:22.726 --> 33:23.726
It's not.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.193
Sure.

33:33.069 --> 33:36.304
<i>"Dear Ella, it's Rebecca!
"Come to New York!</i>

33:36.339 --> 33:38.606
<i>"I need a study buddy!"</i>

33:38.642 --> 33:40.475
Interesting.

33:40.510 --> 33:42.076
I've always wanted to write.

33:42.112 --> 33:42.977
The bartenders
for the Ferris party

33:43.013 --> 33:45.113
just sent over their
service contracts.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.981
How does Marianne do all this?

33:47.017 --> 33:48.650
She must be a genius.

33:48.685 --> 33:51.920
So do we have everything we need
for the Fairmont event?

33:51.955 --> 33:54.289
- Except for the party favours.
- Great.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.224
I'll pick up some
cool stuff tomorrow.

33:56.259 --> 33:58.070
And were you able to put
together that list for me?

33:58.094 --> 34:00.173
The list of the best-selling
Ferris Wheel Toys?

34:00.197 --> 34:01.525
- I'm on it.
- Awesome.

34:02.532 --> 34:04.077
I'm gonna grab a quick bite
with Ray.

34:04.101 --> 34:05.901
Do you want me to
bring you back anything?

34:05.936 --> 34:07.035
Yes.

34:07.070 --> 34:10.538
How about all the details
about your new boyfriend?

34:10.574 --> 34:12.574
I didn't expect to like him
this much.

34:12.609 --> 34:14.576
We have nothing in common.

34:14.610 --> 34:16.578
But you just click.

34:16.612 --> 34:18.379
Exactly.

34:19.248 --> 34:21.483
I keep waiting and hoping
for that.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.485
That feeling.

34:23.520 --> 34:28.389
That instinctive feeling
that everything is just right.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.360
Hi.

34:33.597 --> 34:34.395
Hi.

34:34.431 --> 34:36.331
Looks like I'm in
the right place.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.867
Welcome to Dashworks.

34:38.902 --> 34:39.934
I'll see you later.

34:39.969 --> 34:41.335
Great.

34:45.074 --> 34:47.542
So, this is where
the magic happens.

34:48.512 --> 34:50.123
Less chaotic than I would
have thought.

34:50.147 --> 34:51.579
Thank you.

34:51.614 --> 34:53.782
I'm just happy there
isn't any artwork on display

34:53.817 --> 34:55.460
that would cause me
to ponder it for days

34:55.485 --> 34:57.852
because there simply isn't time.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.053
So, shall we go?

34:59.089 --> 35:01.067
I'm pretty sure the tree I
ordered should be at your place

35:01.091 --> 35:03.091
by the time we pick up
all the decorations.

35:03.126 --> 35:04.225
Tree you ordered?

35:04.261 --> 35:06.072
I thought we were gonna go
to the tree lot together.

35:06.096 --> 35:08.763
What can I say?
Dashworks is full service.

35:10.133 --> 35:12.101
- Come on, Edward.
- Coming!

35:16.306 --> 35:17.472
Oh boy.

35:17.507 --> 35:20.775
This is even more dire
than I expected.

35:20.811 --> 35:22.455
It's a good thing we bought
extra decorations.

35:22.479 --> 35:23.378
Yeah.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.579
OK.

35:24.614 --> 35:25.947
Where should we put it?

35:25.982 --> 35:29.884
How about over here,
by the kitchen?

35:29.920 --> 35:30.920
OK.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.922
- How's this?
- A bit further.

35:34.191 --> 35:35.123
And drop.

35:35.158 --> 35:36.158
Great.

35:37.794 --> 35:38.726
OK?

35:38.762 --> 35:39.661
Fine, thank you.

35:39.696 --> 35:41.729
OK, and one more.

35:45.502 --> 35:47.068
OK, yeah that's good.

35:47.537 --> 35:49.437
Very smooth.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.874
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

35:59.883 --> 36:00.648
Edward.

36:00.684 --> 36:01.961
We should probably
pick up the pace

36:01.985 --> 36:03.751
or we're gonna be here all day.

36:13.363 --> 36:15.530
The Laurents are really
gonna love it.

36:15.565 --> 36:18.333
It's a bit busy.

36:18.368 --> 36:21.603
But I defer to your expertise.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.471
Where was that photo taken?

36:23.506 --> 36:24.539
Iceland.

36:24.574 --> 36:27.041
I travelled there during
my second year of college.

36:27.077 --> 36:28.343
Foreign exchange.

36:29.379 --> 36:31.512
I did my fair share of
travelling after college

36:31.548 --> 36:32.814
with my friend Rebecca.

36:32.849 --> 36:33.748
And then we would come back

36:33.783 --> 36:36.317
and take on part-time jobs
between trips.

36:37.554 --> 36:39.420
So the many careers.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.490
Yeah, well...

36:42.525 --> 36:43.836
After we lost my mom
I just realized

36:43.860 --> 36:46.494
that life was too short,
you know?

36:46.529 --> 36:49.197
I always made it back for
Christmas in Chicago, though.

36:49.232 --> 36:51.299
That's sacred.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.634
A wise person once said

36:52.669 --> 36:54.469
the greatest risk
is true commitment.

36:55.538 --> 36:56.971
Who said that?

36:57.007 --> 36:58.640
I read that in a fortune cookie.

37:03.246 --> 37:04.757
It's actually pretty
funny timing.

37:04.781 --> 37:07.415
I just got an email
from Rebecca asking me

37:07.450 --> 37:10.652
if I'd do this screenwriting
course with her.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.687
Will you?

37:12.722 --> 37:13.655
No.

37:13.690 --> 37:17.225
No, I'm too happy now.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.404
And besides, it's like you said.

37:18.428 --> 37:22.497
I can't... I can't jump around
trying new things forever.

37:23.099 --> 37:25.166
You're sticking with Dashworks?

37:25.201 --> 37:26.401
Yeah.

37:26.436 --> 37:30.338
Yeah, I wanna show Marianne
how committed I am to our work.

37:31.741 --> 37:32.774
Speaking of work,

37:32.809 --> 37:35.610
what did your dad think of those
new truck designs?

37:35.645 --> 37:38.780
Well, I decided to evaluate
them myself first.

37:38.815 --> 37:40.114
Form my own opinion.

37:40.150 --> 37:42.517
A very savvy decision.

37:42.552 --> 37:45.787
- What do the kids think?
- What kids?

37:45.822 --> 37:47.789
The kids who play
with your toys.

37:47.824 --> 37:49.001
What do they want
out of a truck?

37:49.025 --> 37:51.526
Well from the parents
we interviewed we found that...

37:51.561 --> 37:53.795
What?! Wait, what?

37:53.830 --> 37:55.697
You get your information
from parents?

37:55.732 --> 37:57.376
Well, they're the ones doing
the purchasing.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.368
But they're not the ones
doing the playing.

38:01.438 --> 38:02.670
Yeah.

38:05.976 --> 38:08.776
Listen, when some of these
parties wrap up,

38:08.812 --> 38:10.990
you think you'll have some
more free time in the new year?

38:11.014 --> 38:14.782
Yeah, well, if my sister
doesn't keep committing us

38:14.818 --> 38:18.052
to parties she doesn't talk
to me about first, then yeah.

38:19.155 --> 38:20.488
Yeah.

38:20.523 --> 38:22.190
Why?

38:22.826 --> 38:25.159
Well, I was hoping
that I could take you out

38:25.195 --> 38:27.662
for a proper dinner.

38:27.697 --> 38:32.400
Like a... like a... a date?

38:32.435 --> 38:33.435
A date.

38:35.171 --> 38:36.104
If you're interested.

38:36.139 --> 38:38.439
Yeah, I would be.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.074
Great.

38:49.786 --> 38:50.952
See you later.

38:52.856 --> 38:54.055
Ella.

38:54.824 --> 38:56.824
Do we have an appointment?

38:56.860 --> 38:58.926
I'm gonna ask Santa
for a rocket ship.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.828
Hey Thomas.
Are you waiting for your mom?

39:00.864 --> 39:02.964
Actually, Charlotte had
a few errands to run

39:02.999 --> 39:05.366
so I offered to look after
Thomas today.

39:05.402 --> 39:07.035
We're going on an adventure.

39:07.070 --> 39:09.404
An adventure.
Where are you off to?

39:09.439 --> 39:12.140
Actually, Brandon's firm
is hosting a party

39:12.175 --> 39:13.941
for the staff's kids

39:13.977 --> 39:16.511
and I hear Santa will be
making an appearance.

39:16.546 --> 39:17.979
He'll be bringing lots of toys.

39:18.014 --> 39:19.213
Yes.

39:19.249 --> 39:22.383
In fact, I know where Santa
got a lot of his toys this year.

39:22.419 --> 39:24.685
Do you mind if I tag along?
It might be useful for me

39:24.721 --> 39:27.789
to see how the kids interact
with products.

39:27.824 --> 39:28.956
Not at all.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.492
Just make sure you don't cut
in line in front of Thomas

39:31.528 --> 39:32.760
to see Santa.

39:32.796 --> 39:35.174
You're the one that's gonna
be cutting in line to see Santa.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.498
Hey, Thomas, what else
are you gonna ask for

39:37.534 --> 39:39.467
from Santa Claus this year?

39:39.502 --> 39:41.869
- A robot.
- A robot.

39:42.539 --> 39:43.671
Awe, you guys look so great!

39:43.706 --> 39:46.174
- Who's ready to meet Santa?
- Me!

39:46.209 --> 39:47.708
You! Yes!

39:48.344 --> 39:51.312
And what would you like
for Christmas?

39:51.347 --> 39:53.381
A rocket ship.

39:53.416 --> 39:54.649
Yes.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.517
Anything else?

39:56.553 --> 40:00.354
A race car, a tricycle.

40:00.390 --> 40:02.190
<i>A giant robot.</i>

40:02.225 --> 40:04.270
I think he asked for everything
that we make.

40:04.294 --> 40:06.194
He's smart to cast a wide net.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.873
What do you think he'll be
when he grows up?

40:07.897 --> 40:10.098
A firefighter or an astronaut?

40:10.133 --> 40:12.200
I'm putting my money on elf.

40:12.235 --> 40:13.235
I wanted to be an elf.

40:13.269 --> 40:15.002
- No.
- Yes!

40:15.038 --> 40:18.072
I had the whole get up,
even the striped socks.

40:18.108 --> 40:21.476
That I would have loved to see.
You must have been super cute.

40:24.714 --> 40:28.049
<i>He had a great time with Santa.</i>

40:28.084 --> 40:29.550
OK, we'll see you soon.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.187
It's really not a problem, bye.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.122
Hey, Thomas, that was
your mommy.

40:34.157 --> 40:36.257
She's just running
a few minutes behind.

40:36.292 --> 40:39.193
So how shall we fill the time?

40:39.229 --> 40:40.561
Making a snowman.

40:40.597 --> 40:42.930
I don't think we should do that.

40:42.966 --> 40:45.566
I think we should make
three snowmen!

40:45.602 --> 40:47.301
Yeah!

40:47.337 --> 40:48.402
Alright!

40:48.438 --> 40:50.872
Boom. You're a good sport today.

40:53.943 --> 40:54.987
Well, Thomas, what do you think?

40:55.011 --> 40:57.745
Does this look like a good place
to build snowmen?

40:57.780 --> 41:00.548
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.517
Alright, here we go.

41:03.786 --> 41:05.520
Get to it.

41:07.657 --> 41:09.123
OK.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.128
What a beautiful snow family.

41:14.164 --> 41:17.131
Your snowman has a funny
shaped head, Mr. F.

41:17.167 --> 41:20.067
Hey, don't make fun
of my snowman.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.436
You know what
this snowman needs?

41:22.472 --> 41:23.804
What?

41:23.840 --> 41:25.606
Your tie.

41:25.642 --> 41:26.908
Oh, really?

41:26.943 --> 41:28.543
Hand it over.

41:30.547 --> 41:33.414
Besides, you are dressed
way too seriously

41:33.449 --> 41:36.117
for frolicking in the snow,
anyway.

41:36.152 --> 41:40.922
This snowman could really use
an accessory.

41:40.957 --> 41:42.890
There, that's better.

41:43.493 --> 41:45.293
No.
No, no.

41:45.328 --> 41:47.128
Don't even think about it.
Edward.

41:47.163 --> 41:48.996
Don't.
No.

41:49.032 --> 41:50.032
I'm not kidding you!

41:53.469 --> 41:55.436
You're not...

41:57.974 --> 41:59.140
Edward!

41:59.175 --> 42:02.143
And I was worried that you
weren't gonna have a good time.

42:06.516 --> 42:07.682
Thanks.

42:15.726 --> 42:16.992
Come in!

42:19.230 --> 42:21.430
I come bearing pie.

42:23.367 --> 42:25.534
Dashworks really is a
full-service business.

42:25.570 --> 42:26.502
Yeah.

42:26.537 --> 42:30.172
So good luck tonight
and don't say anything

42:30.208 --> 42:34.276
about merry spreadsheets
or whatever.

42:35.379 --> 42:39.682
Since you're here,
could you stay?

42:39.717 --> 42:42.318
You want me to chaperone
your cocktail hour?

42:42.353 --> 42:43.385
Sort of.

42:43.421 --> 42:44.965
It's just that you're so good
with the Laurents

42:44.989 --> 42:48.357
and I think they
really respond...

42:51.162 --> 42:52.695
...respond to your energy.

42:52.730 --> 42:53.796
Sure.

42:53.831 --> 42:54.831
Thank you.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.099
May I take your coat?

43:05.409 --> 43:07.977
- They're early.
- Just breathe.

43:14.285 --> 43:16.819
This trip is terrible
for my diet.

43:16.854 --> 43:20.189
Well what's eaten on
vacation stays on vacation.

43:20.224 --> 43:21.323
Am I right?

43:21.359 --> 43:23.225
Too true, my dear.

43:23.261 --> 43:24.894
She is a delight.

43:24.929 --> 43:27.930
Tell us, Edward, how did
the Ferris's get into toys

43:27.965 --> 43:29.598
in the first place?

43:29.634 --> 43:33.535
Well, my great-grandfather had
limited resources financially

43:33.571 --> 43:36.171
but he was determined to make
sure that my grandfather

43:36.207 --> 43:38.407
could play and have
a normal childhood.

43:38.442 --> 43:40.743
My great-grandmother
did most of the sewing

43:40.778 --> 43:43.913
and they were an amazing team.

43:43.948 --> 43:46.348
That's how the Ferris bear
was born.

43:47.551 --> 43:48.517
That is so sweet.

43:48.552 --> 43:50.386
What a special story.

43:50.421 --> 43:53.122
When my grandfather grew up
he was inspired to bring

43:53.157 --> 43:55.524
the same thing to a whole
new generation of children

43:55.559 --> 43:58.260
so he founded the Ferris Wheel
Toy Company

43:58.296 --> 44:00.362
and the Ferris bear
was the first toy

44:00.398 --> 44:01.530
they put on the market.

44:01.565 --> 44:05.067
My father started the Laurent
Chain from nothing, too.

44:05.102 --> 44:08.804
And look what both our families
have achieved.

44:08.839 --> 44:10.773
Your father must be proud,
Edward,

44:10.808 --> 44:13.776
with you carrying on
the Ferris legacy.

44:13.811 --> 44:15.144
I hope so.

44:15.179 --> 44:19.081
I'm trying to follow
in his footsteps.

44:21.285 --> 44:26.255
I think I saw a stapler...
Here.

44:31.128 --> 44:33.128
Why am I not surprised?

44:33.597 --> 44:36.632
To a successful evening
with the Laurents.

44:36.667 --> 44:37.499
Cheers.

44:37.535 --> 44:40.102
We're practically regulars
here now.

44:42.273 --> 44:45.341
So tell me, how do you come up
with such inventive ideas?

44:45.376 --> 44:47.476
That's the easy part.

44:47.511 --> 44:51.814
My dad always said I had
a robust imagination.

44:51.849 --> 44:55.250
I just love dreaming up ideas
for our parties.

44:55.286 --> 44:56.852
Pragmatic and playful.

44:56.887 --> 44:59.755
That's why I want to take on
bigger projects for Dashworks.

44:59.790 --> 45:03.425
I love our work, I just can't be
satisfied with the status quo.

45:03.461 --> 45:04.994
You shouldn't be satisfied.

45:05.029 --> 45:06.328
The sky is the limit.

45:06.364 --> 45:07.796
Yeah.

45:07.832 --> 45:09.965
Not according to Marianne.

45:10.001 --> 45:13.635
She's pretty content with things
the way they are.

45:15.139 --> 45:18.207
Anyway, what about you?

45:18.242 --> 45:20.609
You know my work bio.

45:20.644 --> 45:24.013
But I don't know what you do
when you're off the clock.

45:24.048 --> 45:30.486
You can't be all graphs
and flow charts.

45:30.521 --> 45:32.287
Believe it or not

45:32.323 --> 45:35.891
I am a nationally-ranked
ping pong player.

45:35.926 --> 45:37.559
No.

45:37.595 --> 45:38.595
For real.

45:41.599 --> 45:43.232
- You did it.
- Yep.

45:43.267 --> 45:45.768
You surprised me.

45:52.610 --> 45:54.710
Honey, I'm home!

45:57.014 --> 45:58.280
Marianne?

46:01.218 --> 46:04.987
Hi. What's wrong?

46:07.792 --> 46:09.191
I found this on your desk.

46:09.226 --> 46:10.159
Yeah.

46:10.194 --> 46:11.493
Rebecca sent that.

46:11.529 --> 46:13.896
It looks cool but
I'm not gonna do it.

46:13.931 --> 46:14.863
You sure?

46:14.899 --> 46:15.864
Yeah, I already wrote to her
to let her know

46:15.900 --> 46:19.234
that she'll be enjoying it
with someone else.

46:19.270 --> 46:20.836
You were tempted?

46:20.871 --> 46:22.538
I mean, a little.

46:22.573 --> 46:23.739
So what?

46:24.809 --> 46:26.019
So you keep saying that
you want to take Dashworks

46:26.043 --> 46:27.776
to the next level.

46:27.812 --> 46:29.678
And I do.

46:29.713 --> 46:31.680
More staff, enhanced marketing.

46:31.715 --> 46:32.715
Loans.

46:32.750 --> 46:33.916
All of it.

46:33.951 --> 46:35.195
Yeah, well if we're gonna
do that

46:35.219 --> 46:38.153
I need to know that you're
fully on board.

46:41.625 --> 46:45.060
Ella, we're in this
partnership together.

46:58.242 --> 47:01.076
I really appreciate you making
this a combo meeting

47:01.112 --> 47:02.277
with my errands.

47:02.313 --> 47:03.779
Sure, no problem.

47:03.814 --> 47:06.815
So I was looking at the seating
chart and I figured

47:06.851 --> 47:10.786
that we can put the marketing
group with accounting.

47:10.821 --> 47:12.921
That seems fine.

47:12.957 --> 47:14.968
Yesterday you were all
about mixing up the departments

47:14.992 --> 47:16.603
so they could get
to know each other.

47:16.627 --> 47:19.728
You called it the holiday
shop talk swap.

47:19.763 --> 47:22.264
Whatever you think is best.

47:23.134 --> 47:24.811
OK, now I definitely know
something's up.

47:24.835 --> 47:29.004
You have never said those words
to me before.

47:29.039 --> 47:31.573
What's going on?

47:31.609 --> 47:33.120
It's really not a big deal, I...

47:33.144 --> 47:36.912
I don't wanna saddle you
with my personal drama.

47:40.818 --> 47:43.819
Is it boy trouble?

47:45.656 --> 47:47.434
Do you secretly have a crush
on Santa Claus,

47:47.458 --> 47:50.159
or is Jack Frost more your type?

47:50.194 --> 47:54.029
No, my problems have nothing
to do with any boys.

47:54.064 --> 47:56.865
How about I buy you an overly
complicated beverage

47:56.901 --> 47:59.768
and you can tell me
all about it?

48:02.573 --> 48:03.817
One almond milk
gingerbread latte,

48:03.841 --> 48:05.385
no foam, with a dash of
whipped cream.

48:05.409 --> 48:08.143
Thank you.
Thank you.

48:08.179 --> 48:11.513
So Marianne doesn't trust you
to take Dashworks seriously?

48:11.549 --> 48:12.681
No.

48:16.554 --> 48:19.521
She thinks
I'm an irresponsible goof.

48:19.557 --> 48:21.201
Well, have you ever considered
putting together

48:21.225 --> 48:22.357
a business plan?

48:22.393 --> 48:25.460
Show her how serious you are
about expanding Dashworks?

48:26.530 --> 48:30.199
That's a really nice suggestion,
I just don't see it working.

48:30.234 --> 48:32.045
Anyway, let's get back
to your errands.

48:32.069 --> 48:33.802
What's next?

48:33.837 --> 48:34.937
Shopping.

48:34.972 --> 48:38.574
I still have a few items left
to cross off my list.

48:38.609 --> 48:40.709
Edward.

48:40.744 --> 48:43.078
You haven't even started
your Christmas shopping,

48:43.113 --> 48:44.713
have you?

48:49.086 --> 48:50.686
Oh, look.

48:50.721 --> 48:54.356
After all that snowman building
you did, you must have this.

48:54.391 --> 48:56.558
It's your destiny.

48:56.594 --> 48:58.994
You may have convinced me
to wear a patterned tie

48:59.029 --> 49:05.367
to the party but this, I'm
afraid, is a bridge too far.

49:05.402 --> 49:06.868
Well, that's your loss.

49:06.904 --> 49:10.339
Just remember, it is the scarf
that got away.

49:11.475 --> 49:13.942
So we've determined who
your romantic type isn't,

49:13.978 --> 49:18.347
but who is Ella Dashwood's
ideal match?

49:18.382 --> 49:22.751
I'll know it's the right person
when I know.

49:28.726 --> 49:30.036
That would really suit you,
miss.

49:30.060 --> 49:32.261
You should buy those
for your girlfriend.

49:32.296 --> 49:33.528
She isn't my...

49:33.564 --> 49:34.029
Oh, no, he's...

49:34.064 --> 49:35.430
We're not... it's...

49:35.466 --> 49:38.233
We're just working... friends.
Colleagues.

49:39.136 --> 49:40.976
Actually, I should get back
to work.

49:41.005 --> 49:42.148
I hope you're feeling better.

49:42.172 --> 49:43.472
I am.

49:43.507 --> 49:44.940
You give a decent pep talk.

49:44.975 --> 49:46.008
Good.

49:47.578 --> 49:49.278
Yeah.

49:58.754 --> 49:59.686
Hi.

49:59.722 --> 50:01.355
Top of the afternoon.

50:01.390 --> 50:03.201
I have some cheques
for you to sign.

50:03.225 --> 50:04.758
They're for the Wabash centre.

50:04.794 --> 50:06.860
We're only two days away
and right on track.

50:06.896 --> 50:09.363
All set.

50:09.398 --> 50:10.564
Thank you.

50:10.599 --> 50:13.567
And while I'm here...

50:13.602 --> 50:14.802
Yes?

50:14.837 --> 50:17.671
I was thinking about what you
said about how I could prove

50:17.706 --> 50:25.245
how serious I am to Marianne
and I think you were right.

50:25.281 --> 50:28.882
Well, that can't have been easy
for you to admit.

50:28.918 --> 50:29.950
I'm serious.

50:29.985 --> 50:31.930
And I was hoping you could
give me some pointers

50:31.954 --> 50:34.021
on how to create
a business plan.

50:34.056 --> 50:37.691
Maybe it will help smooth
things over with Marianne.

50:37.726 --> 50:39.493
Let me show you something.

50:43.432 --> 50:44.865
Take a look.

50:48.304 --> 50:50.237
What in the world?

50:50.272 --> 50:52.083
Well, a professional
presentation like this

50:52.107 --> 50:54.308
is exactly what you need
to move forward.

50:54.343 --> 50:57.311
You just input all your free
form ideas into this spreadsheet

50:57.346 --> 50:59.613
and you're all set.

50:59.648 --> 51:01.949
You did all this for me?

51:01.984 --> 51:03.584
There's nothing to it.

51:03.619 --> 51:05.853
It's what I do, after all.

51:09.158 --> 51:10.390
We're ready to start.

51:10.426 --> 51:11.225
I should go.

51:11.260 --> 51:12.759
You guys are busy.

51:15.531 --> 51:17.264
Thank you so much for this.

51:17.299 --> 51:19.311
I can't wait to get home and add
in the specifics.

51:19.335 --> 51:22.870
Actually, why don't you come and
take a look at what we're doing?

51:28.477 --> 51:31.445
May I present the Ferris Wheel
focus group,

51:31.480 --> 51:33.747
complete with actual kids.

51:33.782 --> 51:35.415
Amazing!

51:35.451 --> 51:38.585
Thomas is so happy he gets
to play with toys all day.

51:38.621 --> 51:40.432
I'm going to bring these kids
some brownies.

51:40.456 --> 51:41.655
Thank you.

51:43.158 --> 51:47.160
So what is everybody up to?

51:51.133 --> 51:52.199
What do you have there?

51:52.234 --> 51:53.767
An airplane.

51:53.802 --> 51:55.769
For me? Thank you.

51:56.238 --> 51:58.205
An airplane?

51:58.240 --> 52:00.707
Well, show me what
the airplane does.

52:03.312 --> 52:05.512
I think your plane can
go higher than my plane.

52:09.919 --> 52:12.219
And what is the meaning of this?

52:12.254 --> 52:14.554
Dad.

52:14.590 --> 52:16.490
What're you doing here?

52:16.525 --> 52:18.358
This is Ella Dashwood.

52:18.394 --> 52:20.961
Ella, this is my father,
Lloyd Ferris.

52:20.996 --> 52:21.795
Hello.

52:21.830 --> 52:22.963
Nice to meet you, sir.

52:22.998 --> 52:23.797
Hi, Lucy.

52:23.832 --> 52:24.798
Hi.

52:24.833 --> 52:26.711
We're just gathering information
from the kids

52:26.735 --> 52:29.202
for next year's
product strategy.

52:29.238 --> 52:31.316
Well, we have a research
and development team for that.

52:31.340 --> 52:33.084
Why not get information,
you know,

52:33.108 --> 52:36.343
directly from the horse's mouth?

52:36.378 --> 52:38.512
That's what I like.

52:40.249 --> 52:42.349
This is utter chaos.

52:42.384 --> 52:44.584
Who's regulating
what they're examining?

52:44.620 --> 52:47.821
With all due respect, sir,
it's called "playing".

52:50.025 --> 52:51.358
We should go, Lloyd.

52:51.393 --> 52:52.225
We're meeting my parents
for lunch.

52:52.261 --> 52:53.672
Are you still free
for drinks later?

52:53.696 --> 52:54.494
Sure thing.

52:54.530 --> 52:55.562
OK.

53:09.712 --> 53:11.278
That was perfect.

53:11.313 --> 53:12.212
Are you sure?

53:12.247 --> 53:14.059
My father never did things
in that manner.

53:14.083 --> 53:17.351
That was just so haphazard.

53:17.386 --> 53:20.120
Right, but kids with toys
are bound to be haphazard.

53:20.155 --> 53:21.900
And you are not obligated
to follow every step

53:21.924 --> 53:23.557
your father took.

53:23.592 --> 53:24.624
Follow my own path.

53:24.660 --> 53:25.325
Exactly.

53:25.361 --> 53:26.126
If you plan on being innovative

53:26.161 --> 53:28.562
you'll have to take
a few chances.

53:28.597 --> 53:30.564
I suppose you're right.

53:34.269 --> 53:35.535
How are you today?

53:35.571 --> 53:38.271
Did you talk to Marianne?

53:38.307 --> 53:40.140
Not yet.

53:40.175 --> 53:42.242
We're kind of avoiding
each other.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.866
Sorry, I'm late.

54:05.901 --> 54:08.969
There was a mix up at the
factory with the action figures.

54:09.004 --> 54:13.306
That is the dog-ate-my-homework
of the toy world, isn't it?

54:13.342 --> 54:16.410
So why did you want
to meet here, anyway?

54:16.445 --> 54:18.445
Perfect timing.

54:27.990 --> 54:31.825
I didn't know that... that
you were gonna be here.

54:31.860 --> 54:32.993
Me neither.

54:33.028 --> 54:33.927
Yeah.

54:33.962 --> 54:35.362
No, Edward set this up.

54:35.397 --> 54:38.131
We have some very important
business to conduct.

54:38.167 --> 54:40.767
We are making
gingerbread houses.

54:42.371 --> 54:43.236
<i>Yes!</i>

54:43.272 --> 54:45.138
Let's get cracking,
get some supplies.

54:45.174 --> 54:47.974
The best gingerbread
house wins a prize.

54:52.214 --> 54:53.647
So what's this all about?

54:53.682 --> 54:56.383
You said there was
a festive crisis?

54:56.418 --> 54:59.386
Well, I know you're upset about
the situation with Marianne

54:59.421 --> 55:01.455
and I know how much you cherish

55:01.490 --> 55:04.224
spending time with her
during the holidays.

55:04.259 --> 55:05.792
Hence this evening.

55:08.263 --> 55:10.897
That was incredibly
thoughtful of you.

55:10.933 --> 55:13.366
Call me your kindly
Christmas elf.

55:13.402 --> 55:14.434
Slow down.

55:14.470 --> 55:17.370
You haven't exactly achieved
elf status just yet.

55:17.406 --> 55:19.906
OK, so how does this gingerbread
making work?

55:19.942 --> 55:23.910
I get the impression
that you are an expert.

55:23.946 --> 55:25.846
I've made a few houses
in my day,

55:25.881 --> 55:27.158
but I'm still gonna need
your help.

55:27.182 --> 55:28.348
Fine.

55:28.383 --> 55:30.217
But I am in charge of the icing.

55:30.252 --> 55:31.451
Deal.

55:32.121 --> 55:33.364
<i>I guess we'll start
with the roof.</i>

55:33.388 --> 55:35.188
<i>Seems like a ridiculous idea.</i>

55:35.224 --> 55:36.089
You're being very judgemental.

55:36.125 --> 55:38.892
I guess that's what
we're gonna find...

55:41.563 --> 55:44.264
Oh boy.

55:44.299 --> 55:45.065
We're gonna win now.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.133
Yeah.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.308
Thank you.

55:57.446 --> 55:58.578
Congratulations.

55:58.614 --> 55:59.813
Congratulations!

56:03.752 --> 56:04.551
Thank you.

56:04.586 --> 56:06.953
Hey, looks pretty good.

56:06.989 --> 56:08.021
Good.

56:09.591 --> 56:11.658
Congratulations on...

56:12.127 --> 56:13.260
Thanks.

56:13.295 --> 56:16.530
I hate spending
the season apart.

56:16.565 --> 56:19.166
I'm really grateful to Edward
for arranging this.

56:22.237 --> 56:23.336
Stay.

56:24.640 --> 56:26.339
Hey, John, what's up?

56:28.277 --> 56:29.776
No.

56:31.079 --> 56:34.714
The Wabash booked the event
for the wrong day.

56:36.084 --> 56:37.918
We just lost our venue.

56:42.590 --> 56:44.624
Thank you anyway for trying.

56:46.995 --> 56:49.362
Well, the party
is two days away.

56:49.397 --> 56:50.863
What're we gonna do?

56:50.899 --> 56:52.343
It says the 23rd
on the contract.

56:52.367 --> 56:53.477
Right here in black and white.

56:53.501 --> 56:54.867
Meaning it's their error.

56:54.903 --> 56:56.402
Shouldn't they do something?

56:56.438 --> 56:58.571
Well, they offered you
the venue for free.

56:58.606 --> 57:00.006
Next year.

57:00.041 --> 57:01.174
OK, people.

57:01.209 --> 57:04.510
This isn't the first time
we've faced a venue problem.

57:04.546 --> 57:05.511
You know what to do.

57:05.547 --> 57:07.391
I'm already on the phone
with the Delano hotel.

57:07.415 --> 57:09.493
Margaret and I are emailing
every place we can think of

57:09.517 --> 57:11.384
within a 20-mile radius.

57:11.419 --> 57:12.919
Thank you.

57:12.954 --> 57:14.220
Edward, you don't have to stay.

57:14.255 --> 57:16.389
I know you've got plans
with Lucy.

57:16.424 --> 57:17.356
Don't be absurd.

57:17.392 --> 57:18.891
She'll understand.

57:21.229 --> 57:24.063
OK, what can I do to help?

57:24.099 --> 57:26.733
Maybe order us some snacks?

57:26.768 --> 57:29.168
I think it's gonna be
a long night.

57:29.204 --> 57:30.369
Done.

57:34.309 --> 57:36.275
Marianne, I am so sorry.

57:36.311 --> 57:38.111
This is all my fault.

57:38.146 --> 57:40.079
I know I let you down again.

57:40.115 --> 57:41.714
It's a disaster.

57:41.750 --> 57:43.761
You knew the venue was gonna
make a colossal mistake

57:43.785 --> 57:47.253
you had no control over?

57:47.288 --> 57:49.722
You're not mad?

57:49.758 --> 57:51.657
Not at you.

57:52.660 --> 57:54.594
It's a set-back.

57:54.629 --> 57:56.562
Not a disaster.

58:00.835 --> 58:01.901
What?

58:03.505 --> 58:05.439
OK. OK.

58:07.675 --> 58:08.975
Edward?

58:09.010 --> 58:10.243
I have a solution.

58:10.278 --> 58:12.512
We're gonna throw the party
at your house.

58:13.448 --> 58:14.714
My house?

58:16.651 --> 58:17.750
No, that's impossible.

58:17.786 --> 58:18.918
I don't think that...

58:18.953 --> 58:20.720
Do you trust me?

58:23.024 --> 58:24.590
I really hope this works.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.492
Me too.

58:26.528 --> 58:31.964
But regardless, you have been
really focussed.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.333
Edward's been a good influence
on you.

58:34.369 --> 58:36.636
He has his moments.

58:39.808 --> 58:42.942
Whatever happens at Dashworks,

58:42.977 --> 58:47.613
you know that I love you, right?

58:47.649 --> 58:49.282
No matter what.

58:49.317 --> 58:50.616
Me too.

58:50.652 --> 58:52.518
You're my best friend, Marianne.

58:52.554 --> 58:55.087
Nothing's ever gonna
change that.

58:55.123 --> 58:58.291
I would hate to spend
the holidays away from you.

59:03.965 --> 59:06.332
Hey, maybe after all this is
all over you'll tell me what

59:06.367 --> 59:09.836
was going on between you
and Brandon at the Town Square.

59:09.871 --> 59:12.205
Hey. I got pizza.

59:12.240 --> 59:13.873
Great.

59:13.908 --> 59:15.341
Pepperoni.

59:20.582 --> 59:22.448
Mom, dad.

59:22.483 --> 59:23.516
Thank you for coming.

59:23.551 --> 59:24.884
What's the occasion?

59:24.919 --> 59:27.553
I see you've gone all out
on the decorations.

59:27.589 --> 59:31.357
Well, I... I wanted to talk
with you about something.

59:32.493 --> 59:33.659
Dad?

59:33.695 --> 59:34.927
Yes.

59:34.963 --> 59:38.130
I have nothing but respect for
you but I run the company now

59:38.166 --> 59:41.567
and I need the freedom to start
making decisions on my own.

59:41.603 --> 59:44.503
I was at the helm of Ferris
Wheel for a long time.

59:44.539 --> 59:47.139
I simply want you to benefit
from my experience.

59:47.175 --> 59:49.408
You've trained me my whole
life and I'm ready.

59:49.444 --> 59:51.577
There is still more
for you to learn, you know.

59:51.613 --> 59:52.613
When I was...

59:57.385 --> 59:58.385
OK.

01:00:00.188 --> 01:00:01.387
OK.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:10.796
Maybe we can take a picture
to remember this occasion.

01:00:13.268 --> 01:00:19.071
Our first eggnog
family portrait.

01:00:19.607 --> 01:00:21.007
OK.

01:00:22.377 --> 01:00:24.911
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:00:26.114 --> 01:00:27.947
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:27.982 --> 01:00:29.215
What's going on?

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.694
I'm just going over the invoices

01:00:30.718 --> 01:00:31.884
from the last few events.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.886
Hey, I meant to tell
you yesterday,

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:38.958
but really nice work
troubleshooting all of that.

01:00:38.993 --> 01:00:39.959
That was amazing.

01:00:39.994 --> 01:00:41.227
Thank you.

01:00:41.262 --> 01:00:43.429
Couldn't have done it
without you.

01:00:43.464 --> 01:00:45.831
Hey, that's what partners
are for.

01:00:52.407 --> 01:00:53.272
What?

01:00:53.308 --> 01:00:54.340
Nothing.

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.220
It's just Edward getting
into the Christmas Spirit.

01:00:56.244 --> 01:00:57.176
You know your whole

01:00:57.211 --> 01:01:00.046
"I'll know the right man
when I know" mantra?

01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:02.715
Yeah, it's what I believe.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.417
Then how come you can't see him

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:07.153
when he's standing right
in front of you?

01:01:07.188 --> 01:01:08.654
What?

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:10.556
Who are you even talking about?

01:01:10.591 --> 01:01:12.325
Edward, obviously.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.726
OK.

01:01:13.761 --> 01:01:15.227
He is enthralled by you.

01:01:15.263 --> 01:01:17.229
You clearly like him.

01:01:17.265 --> 01:01:18.842
Every time you walk
into the room

01:01:18.866 --> 01:01:21.934
he's got these great big
puppy dog eyes over you.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:22.568
OK, OK.

01:01:22.603 --> 01:01:24.103
There is nothing going on

01:01:24.138 --> 01:01:25.972
between me and Edward, alright?

01:01:26.007 --> 01:01:28.774
We are getting along better
than we did at the beginning

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.576
but that's it, and besides,

01:01:30.611 --> 01:01:34.280
he is clearly interested
in his colleague, Lucy.

01:01:34.315 --> 01:01:36.315
They... they were high school
sweethearts.

01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:39.452
Look, you don't have
to admit it to me,

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:43.322
but you might consider telling
Edward how you feel.

01:01:50.698 --> 01:01:53.132
What a charming gathering.

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.367
What should we do?

01:01:54.402 --> 01:01:56.714
Well, I've been told
the Christmas season isn't complete

01:01:56.738 --> 01:01:59.605
without a sleigh ride.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640
Mais oui.

01:02:04.545 --> 01:02:06.190
Thank you for suggesting
that I invite

01:02:06.214 --> 01:02:08.781
Jacques and Vivienne
back out tonight.

01:02:08.816 --> 01:02:10.783
Well, consider me
your holiday guru.

01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:16.689
Well, it's office party eve.

01:02:16.724 --> 01:02:20.359
One more day until they make
their decision.

01:02:20.395 --> 01:02:21.460
Salut!

01:02:21.496 --> 01:02:23.629
Joyeux Noel!

01:02:23.664 --> 01:02:26.665
And three more days
until Christmas.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.334
When you can finally get back

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:32.471
to your regularly
scheduled paperwork.

01:02:32.507 --> 01:02:35.875
It can't have been easy for you,
enjoying yourself like this.

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:39.412
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm spending all of Christmas

01:02:39.447 --> 01:02:40.579
with my parents.

01:02:40.615 --> 01:02:41.981
Really?

01:02:42.016 --> 01:02:43.749
That's wonderful.

01:02:43.785 --> 01:02:48.154
Your spirit is contagious.

01:02:48.189 --> 01:02:56.028
And you can be kind of fun
when you let your guard down.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:58.497
I think that's your doing.

01:02:59.801 --> 01:03:03.035
I have something for you.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:05.037
You didn't have to do that.

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:06.505
I don't have anything for you.

01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:08.841
It's just a small gift of
gratitude to say

01:03:08.876 --> 01:03:11.177
thank you for going
above and beyond.

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.917
It's a Ferris bear!

01:03:17.952 --> 01:03:22.221
You are looking at the prototype
of Ferris bear 2.0.

01:03:23.124 --> 01:03:24.701
After the focus group
with the kids

01:03:24.725 --> 01:03:27.026
I decided to re-launch the line.

01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:30.029
Well he's perfect and I will
take very good care of him.

01:03:30.565 --> 01:03:31.897
Also...

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:44.810
I can't imagine it
on anyone else.

01:03:44.846 --> 01:03:46.712
Except the bear.

01:03:47.181 --> 01:03:48.914
I really don't know what to say.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:53.652
It's just way too much.

01:03:53.688 --> 01:03:55.721
It's not nearly enough.

01:04:01.095 --> 01:04:03.762
Also, I've figured you out.

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:05.264
Meaning?

01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:08.100
Meaning I know your type.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.503
It's frosty the snowman.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:14.473
You got me.

01:04:14.509 --> 01:04:18.277
And I have always wanted a man
who looks good in a hat.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.150
M'lady?

01:04:27.221 --> 01:04:28.354
Hello, sir.

01:04:28.389 --> 01:04:30.256
Hello, there.

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:33.159
Miss?

01:04:33.194 --> 01:04:34.026
Thank you.

01:04:34.061 --> 01:04:35.094
Allow me.

01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:43.903
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:04:47.107 --> 01:04:48.387
Almost there.

01:04:49.376 --> 01:04:50.742
Almost there.

01:04:50.778 --> 01:04:53.078
Just a few more steps.

01:04:53.113 --> 01:04:55.847
Alright, are you ready?

01:04:55.883 --> 01:04:58.050
Yes, can you take this off now?

01:05:18.906 --> 01:05:20.706
You are a magician.

01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:23.308
I am blown away.

01:05:23.343 --> 01:05:25.043
You really like it?

01:05:25.079 --> 01:05:26.044
I love it.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.045
Thank you so much.

01:05:27.081 --> 01:05:28.680
You're welcome.

01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:37.222
Here come my parents
and the Laurents.

01:05:37.257 --> 01:05:39.191
It's the moment of truth.

01:05:39.593 --> 01:05:41.259
Hello, welcome.

01:05:41.295 --> 01:05:43.762
This is quite the event
you put together.

01:05:43.797 --> 01:05:46.264
We're having the most
fabulous time.

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.433
Well, we have Ella
to thank for that.

01:05:48.469 --> 01:05:51.603
We wanted your last night
in town to be a special one.

01:05:51.638 --> 01:05:54.906
Vivienne and I hope to return
the favour.

01:05:54.942 --> 01:05:57.476
We have made a decision.

01:05:57.511 --> 01:06:00.979
We would be honoured to carry
Ferris Wheel Toys

01:06:01.014 --> 01:06:03.215
in all our stores.

01:06:04.885 --> 01:06:07.018
I am so excited!

01:06:07.054 --> 01:06:09.788
Thank you!

01:06:09.823 --> 01:06:13.825
We will firm up all the details
in the new year.

01:06:16.797 --> 01:06:18.497
Congratulations, son.

01:06:18.532 --> 01:06:20.132
Well done.

01:06:23.637 --> 01:06:25.804
You did it!

01:06:26.874 --> 01:06:28.440
We did it.

01:06:30.077 --> 01:06:32.277
May I have this dance?

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:43.722
I'm getting a lot of compliments
on the party.

01:06:43.757 --> 01:06:45.724
I hope you brought lots
of business cards.

01:06:45.759 --> 01:06:47.237
I'm very glad that
I eavesdropped

01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:51.963
on your conversation with
Brandon and scored this gig.

01:06:51.999 --> 01:06:54.800
Me too.

01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:03.308
Check these two out.

01:07:03.343 --> 01:07:05.043
I know.

01:07:05.078 --> 01:07:08.346
Somebody needs to tell someone
how they feel.

01:07:15.622 --> 01:07:16.666
Tell him.

01:07:21.595 --> 01:07:26.164
Edward, I...

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.399
Sorry to interrupt, boss.

01:07:27.434 --> 01:07:29.234
Lucy's looking for you.

01:07:30.871 --> 01:07:31.937
I should...

01:07:31.972 --> 01:07:32.904
Of course.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.073
You're the host, you have
to stay on duty.

01:07:35.108 --> 01:07:37.509
Save me room on your dance card?

01:07:37.544 --> 01:07:38.844
Will do.

01:07:39.947 --> 01:07:41.346
<i>Lucy.</i>

01:07:43.984 --> 01:07:46.384
Edward, I can't believe
you pulled it off.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.221
Memories of high school
winter formal.

01:07:54.595 --> 01:07:55.927
He sounds like a great guy.

01:07:55.963 --> 01:07:57.362
He is.

01:07:57.397 --> 01:07:59.142
Well, selfishly I'm hoping
it works out

01:07:59.166 --> 01:08:00.977
so that way my dad will stop
harassing me

01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:02.441
about us getting back
together again.

01:08:04.004 --> 01:08:07.072
You were the perfect
high school boyfriend,

01:08:07.107 --> 01:08:09.374
and we're much better off
as friends.

01:08:09.409 --> 01:08:13.979
Besides, I think you have
an eye on someone else.

01:08:14.014 --> 01:08:16.314
Oh yeah?

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:18.161
Edward Ferris, I have known you
my entire life.

01:08:18.185 --> 01:08:19.629
I have never seen you look
at a woman

01:08:19.653 --> 01:08:21.720
the way you look at
Ella Dashwood.

01:08:21.755 --> 01:08:22.953
What can I say?

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:24.923
She's... she's very special
to me.

01:08:24.957 --> 01:08:28.627
It just feels right.

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:46.111
I have to admit,
I think this is our best party ever.

01:08:46.145 --> 01:08:47.645
Good work.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.113
I'm gonna go check on dessert.

01:08:53.053 --> 01:08:54.618
Hey, hey, it's time for Edward

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:55.754
to say a few words.

01:08:55.788 --> 01:08:56.720
Can you take this mic to him?

01:08:56.756 --> 01:08:58.857
- I... I... I...
- I gotta go help Francesco.

01:08:58.892 --> 01:08:59.624
OK.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.059
Thanks.

01:09:01.862 --> 01:09:03.094
Hey, dad.

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:04.274
Are you having a good evening?

01:09:04.298 --> 01:09:06.430
I'm really proud of you, son.

01:09:06.466 --> 01:09:07.232
I was wrong.

01:09:07.267 --> 01:09:09.935
You know exactly
what you're doing.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.502
That means the world to me.

01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:13.104
Come here.

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:17.975
Hey, Stanley.

01:09:18.011 --> 01:09:19.144
Merry early Christmas.

01:09:19.179 --> 01:09:21.546
Tremendous news about Laurent.

01:09:21.581 --> 01:09:25.216
Well, you know, all of us on
the board were just ecstatic.

01:09:25.252 --> 01:09:28.118
Ferris Wheel is in extremely
capable hands.

01:09:28.154 --> 01:09:30.522
Edward is gonna make
a truly fine leader.

01:09:30.557 --> 01:09:32.524
Indeed.

01:09:32.559 --> 01:09:33.959
Stanley.

01:09:34.761 --> 01:09:36.194
Who organized this party?

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:38.063
They did a marvellous job.

01:09:38.098 --> 01:09:42.167
It's just a small planner
we found last minute.

01:09:42.202 --> 01:09:45.170
My wife and I are celebrating
our anniversary next year.

01:09:45.205 --> 01:09:47.305
We need someone to organize it
for us.

01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:48.974
You know, it's our 30th.

01:09:49.943 --> 01:09:52.477
That is quite a milestone,

01:09:52.511 --> 01:09:54.913
but I don't think my planners
are for you.

01:09:54.948 --> 01:09:57.716
They're unsuitable.

01:09:57.751 --> 01:10:00.251
Well that's good to know.

01:10:00.287 --> 01:10:01.353
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:10:01.388 --> 01:10:04.522
Well, anyway, wonderful work
on the Laurent project.

01:10:04.558 --> 01:10:05.991
Thank you.

01:10:10.263 --> 01:10:11.363
Hey, there you are.

01:10:11.398 --> 01:10:13.543
Can I take you for another spin
around the dance floor?

01:10:13.567 --> 01:10:15.400
It's time for your speech.

01:10:15.435 --> 01:10:16.668
Well, after my speech.

01:10:16.703 --> 01:10:18.036
I'm not really in the mood.

01:10:18.071 --> 01:10:19.004
Hey.

01:10:19.039 --> 01:10:21.172
Can I get you a glass
of champagne, or...?

01:10:21.208 --> 01:10:22.785
Why did you offer to build
our business plan

01:10:22.809 --> 01:10:25.210
when you obviously think
I'm a total joke?

01:10:25.245 --> 01:10:27.078
I don't think that at all.

01:10:27.114 --> 01:10:29.058
I want you to take Dashworks
to new heights.

01:10:29.082 --> 01:10:30.193
The sky's the limit, remember?

01:10:30.217 --> 01:10:34.886
If that were true then why would
you say I'm unsuitable?

01:10:34.921 --> 01:10:36.087
Oh, no.

01:10:36.123 --> 01:10:37.522
No, that's not...

01:10:37.557 --> 01:10:39.035
I hope you and Lucy
enjoy your evening together.

01:10:39.059 --> 01:10:40.425
Ella, I need...

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.105
OK, you already have
a microphone.

01:10:42.129 --> 01:10:43.239
It's time for your speech.
Let's go.

01:10:43.263 --> 01:10:44.796
I just need to explain...

01:10:44.831 --> 01:10:46.064
Let's go.

01:10:50.804 --> 01:10:52.437
Hi...

01:10:55.075 --> 01:10:59.911
I have some exciting news
to share with you.

01:10:59.946 --> 01:11:02.614
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.115
You OK?

01:11:04.151 --> 01:11:05.650
Just not feeling well is all.

01:11:05.685 --> 01:11:09.054
This is, it's been a big success
for Ferris Wheel tonight

01:11:09.089 --> 01:11:11.089
and I couldn't have done
it alone.

01:11:11.124 --> 01:11:11.990
<i>I need to...</i>

01:11:12.025 --> 01:11:14.426
OK, well things are
running smoothly,

01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:15.938
I mean, the staff can
take care of the rest

01:11:15.962 --> 01:11:17.062
if you wanna head home.

01:11:17.097 --> 01:11:18.730
Are you sure?

01:11:18.765 --> 01:11:21.166
Yeah, of course.

01:11:21.201 --> 01:11:22.801
I'll see you at home.

01:11:22.836 --> 01:11:24.602
Ferris Wheel Toys
will be carried

01:11:24.638 --> 01:11:28.239
in the European Laurent
Chain of stores.

01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:37.483
There you are.

01:11:37.518 --> 01:11:39.551
Are you still feeling sick?

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:40.719
Edward was asking about you.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:42.488
He was really worried about you.

01:11:42.523 --> 01:11:45.557
He should worry about
his girlfriend, not me.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.426
His what?

01:11:47.461 --> 01:11:49.395
His girlfriend?

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.829
He's with Lucy.

01:11:50.865 --> 01:11:53.198
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:57.836
I'm so sorry.

01:11:57.872 --> 01:11:58.737
No wonder you're upset.

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:00.506
I... I had no idea.

01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:01.373
It's OK.

01:12:01.409 --> 01:12:02.608
No, it's not.

01:12:02.643 --> 01:12:05.244
I shouldn't have egged you on
about your feelings for him.

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:07.045
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:09.615
It's not your fault.

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:14.219
But hey, your idea to take
on the Ferris event,

01:12:14.255 --> 01:12:15.788
that was a really good one.

01:12:15.823 --> 01:12:19.057
You should see all of the
business cards I collected.

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:21.226
I know!

01:12:21.262 --> 01:12:22.361
Isn't that amazing?

01:12:23.764 --> 01:12:25.442
You should call some of those
in the new year

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.366
and set up some appointments.

01:12:27.768 --> 01:12:30.035
Unsuitable. Yeah right.

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:31.703
I'm sorry, what?

01:12:31.739 --> 01:12:33.038
Nothing.

01:12:33.073 --> 01:12:34.606
It doesn't matter.

01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:42.981
It's not a big thing,
but those are for Santa.

01:12:43.017 --> 01:12:44.316
Can you just give me this?

01:12:44.351 --> 01:12:45.250
Yep.

01:12:45.286 --> 01:12:46.452
Thanks.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:03.235
<i>Hi, it's Ella.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:16.348
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:13:16.383 --> 01:13:20.452
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:13:20.488 --> 01:13:22.354
You ready to get your gift on?

01:13:22.389 --> 01:13:23.956
You know it.

01:13:23.991 --> 01:13:24.991
This one first.

01:13:29.563 --> 01:13:30.395
Merry Christmas!

01:13:30.431 --> 01:13:32.698
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:13:32.733 --> 01:13:34.466
I'm so glad you're here.

01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:38.837
It's so cute!

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:40.939
Wait for it.

01:13:40.975 --> 01:13:42.107
Matching bottoms?

01:13:42.142 --> 01:13:43.709
Stop.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.717
I thought you could enjoy those
in your retirement.

01:13:51.752 --> 01:13:54.486
I am signing up
for golf lessons.

01:13:54.522 --> 01:13:55.522
They're perfect.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:56.622
Thank you.

01:13:56.657 --> 01:14:01.860
Somewhere in here there may be
another one for you.

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:04.530
Of course.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:06.965
Here it is.

01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:09.001
Thank you.

01:14:14.041 --> 01:14:18.377
This is the most festive scarf
I have ever seen.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:20.145
You think I don't know you?

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:21.380
I love it. Thank you.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:22.915
You're welcome.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:24.270
I might have another gift
for you.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:28.387
Hello.

01:14:38.632 --> 01:14:42.501
Is this a financial ledger?

01:14:42.536 --> 01:14:44.503
It is.

01:14:44.538 --> 01:14:46.538
It's our year-end accounting.

01:14:46.574 --> 01:14:49.675
And I've also been working
on a business proposal

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:53.412
that showcases all of
Dashworks' potential.

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:56.848
I'm gonna be the equal partner
you deserve.

01:14:57.318 --> 01:14:58.750
This is all I ever wanted.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:00.619
Marianne.

01:15:00.654 --> 01:15:01.787
Your commitment.

01:15:01.822 --> 01:15:05.924
I...

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.895
I would love to grow the
business and try bigger things,

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:14.232
I just... I just
didn't want to do it alone.

01:15:14.268 --> 01:15:15.968
This is incredible.

01:15:16.003 --> 01:15:18.570
Thank you.

01:15:18.606 --> 01:15:24.109
If you can handle it, I have
one more present for you.

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:26.745
Just after new year's
I'm gonna be moving out.

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.813
What?

01:15:27.848 --> 01:15:31.416
I mean...
You found a place?

01:15:31.452 --> 01:15:33.785
With a two year lease.

01:15:34.455 --> 01:15:36.355
I'm really proud of you.

01:15:44.431 --> 01:15:45.130
Thank you.

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:46.565
Come in!

01:15:47.868 --> 01:15:48.834
Brandon.

01:15:48.869 --> 01:15:50.469
Greetings, Ferris family.

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:51.470
Uncle Lloyd.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:52.804
Hi.

01:15:53.474 --> 01:15:55.507
Evelyn, looking lovely.

01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:56.820
So I'm just on my way
to Marianne's,

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.777
thought I'd pop in,
say merry Christmas.

01:15:58.812 --> 01:16:01.813
Merry Christmas
to you, too, dear.

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:02.849
Hey, cous.

01:16:03.217 --> 01:16:04.616
Hey, cous.

01:16:04.652 --> 01:16:05.652
Merry Christmas.

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.452
Merry Christmas.

01:16:07.488 --> 01:16:09.354
Don't mind if I do.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:10.555
Look.

01:16:10.591 --> 01:16:14.126
Is there something you wanna
tell me about you and Lucy?

01:16:14.161 --> 01:16:15.327
No.

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:18.830
Well, according to Ella you
and Lucy are an item again.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.338
There's something I have to do.

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.106
Can you come with me?

01:16:28.142 --> 01:16:29.441
Yeah.

01:16:30.577 --> 01:16:33.512
You don't mind that I invited
Brandon over, do you?

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:34.980
Not at all.

01:16:35.015 --> 01:16:36.782
I'm really happy for you guys.

01:16:36.817 --> 01:16:39.451
You look super cute together.

01:16:39.486 --> 01:16:40.619
Please.

01:16:42.089 --> 01:16:43.221
What're you waiting for?

01:16:43.257 --> 01:16:44.556
Go get him.

01:16:44.591 --> 01:16:45.691
OK.

01:16:53.033 --> 01:16:54.366
<i>That is so sweet.</i>

01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:55.434
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:58.036
Hi Brandon.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:00.639
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:17:00.674 --> 01:17:02.974
I will give you guys
some privacy.

01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:05.510
I have some packing
to get cracking on, anyway.

01:17:05.546 --> 01:17:06.546
Wait.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.715
I think there's somebody
else at the door.

01:17:16.857 --> 01:17:18.623
What're you doing here?

01:17:21.395 --> 01:17:24.096
I needed to explain
what happened at the party

01:17:24.131 --> 01:17:29.134
and you won't answer my calls
so... here I am.

01:17:29.169 --> 01:17:30.902
Well, there's no need.

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:32.382
Shouldn't you be
with your parents?

01:17:32.406 --> 01:17:34.039
I was with them earlier,

01:17:34.074 --> 01:17:38.744
but they know how important
it is that I talk to you today.

01:17:39.279 --> 01:17:41.580
There's really nothing
left to say.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:44.282
You don't believe in me
but that's OK because,

01:17:44.318 --> 01:17:46.463
Marianne and I are moving
forward with our plans anyway.

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:49.121
I think there was
a misunderstanding.

01:17:49.156 --> 01:17:51.089
I heard what you said
to Stanley Green.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:56.061
Yes, but you don't know why
I said it.

01:17:56.096 --> 01:18:00.732
Stanley is notoriously awful
to work for.

01:18:00.768 --> 01:18:04.636
He is by far the most difficult
board member we have

01:18:04.671 --> 01:18:06.905
and he never pays
his invoices on time.

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.306
I see.

01:18:08.342 --> 01:18:14.613
I was trying to protect you.

01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:17.682
Well, I apologize for jumping
to conclusions.

01:18:17.718 --> 01:18:20.118
Thank you for clearing that up,

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:22.154
and I hope you have
a wonderful holiday.

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:26.424
Yeah.

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:36.802
There's actually one more thing
I really need to clear up.

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:38.882
I don't know what you think
you saw between Lucy and me

01:18:38.906 --> 01:18:41.840
but we are just friends.

01:18:41.875 --> 01:18:44.943
That is all we will ever be.

01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:46.678
Really?

01:18:47.915 --> 01:18:49.314
Really.

01:18:57.157 --> 01:18:58.157
Maybe we sh...

01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:00.659
Fresh air.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:02.494
That would be great.

01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:05.831
Looks like we have it
all to ourselves.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.111
I feel like we spent so much
time getting ready

01:19:08.135 --> 01:19:12.304
for the party that we hardly had
any time to enjoy Christmas,

01:19:12.339 --> 01:19:14.172
just you and I.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:21.580
Ella...

01:19:21.615 --> 01:19:22.615
Ed...

01:19:24.117 --> 01:19:25.283
Please.

01:19:26.086 --> 01:19:29.521
Ever since we had our first
disagreement about the painting

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:33.391
you have challenged me,
you've motivated me,

01:19:33.427 --> 01:19:36.995
and you have made me laugh
the entire time.

01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:38.997
In fact...

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:45.003
You bought it.

01:19:45.038 --> 01:19:50.508
I couldn't let my destiny
scarf get away.

01:19:50.544 --> 01:19:55.180
And I couldn't let you get away.

01:19:56.049 --> 01:19:57.682
You couldn't?

01:19:58.252 --> 01:19:59.684
You're extraordinary.

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:06.024
You make me sound pretty great.

01:20:06.059 --> 01:20:10.795
I think you and me
are perfect together.

01:20:14.334 --> 01:20:17.102
No one has frustrated me more.

01:20:19.239 --> 01:20:26.912
You honestly drive me crazy,
but in the best possible way.

01:20:31.518 --> 01:20:35.086
Ella Dashwood, I am
wild about you.

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:38.924
I'm wild about you, too,
Edward Ferris.

01:20:44.264 --> 01:20:50.435
Do you wanna take a risk
with me?

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.439
More than anything.

01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:29.274
Here you go.

01:21:29.309 --> 01:21:30.709
Oh, great.

01:21:30.744 --> 01:21:32.711
Thank you.

01:21:32.746 --> 01:21:35.850
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
