00:00.880 --> 00:02.120
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.200 --> 00:03.326
You're choosing her over me.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.885
Wouldn't it be
wonderful if Nick was in

00:04.960 --> 00:08.089
mortal danger and
needed Mummy's help?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.204
What's in it for me?
A whole new life.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.527
With a family that values what you are.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.840
No!

00:13.920 --> 00:16.207
One step closer and
I'll snap her pretty neck.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.362
He may not be dead, but he's
not gonna be feeling too good

00:18.440 --> 00:19.680
after that many rubber bullets.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.800
What did you do to me?
I think we cured you.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.209
Hey! I can't believe
you got here.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.361
Trubel?

00:27.440 --> 00:28.521
Kelly?
Juliette.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.170
Thank God you're here.
Nick's not home,

00:30.240 --> 00:31.800
but I am, and
the front door's unlocked.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.008
Diana. Hey.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.285
We got her!
And we've got her.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.366
Nick.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.925
"O, from this time forth, my thoughts
be bloody or be nothing worth."

00:51.280 --> 00:53.282
No!

00:53.360 --> 00:56.762
No!

00:57.280 --> 00:58.725
It's his mom.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.965
Oh, my God.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.491
What did you see
when you were here?

01:04.239 --> 01:05.890
I didn't see this. But...

01:06.120 --> 01:08.200
One of the guys outside, a
Hundjager, he followed me.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.527
If one of them followed you, there's
gotta be more of them around.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.886
We can't stay here.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.089
Nick, Nick.
This could be a trap.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.685
Trubel's right, Nick,
we gotta go.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.607
Nick, look at me. Hey, look at me!
This is a trap!

01:23.720 --> 01:25.040
Burkhardt's in the house.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.891
Kill him.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.127
He's not alone,
there are two people with him.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.562
Doesn't matter, kill them all.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.968
You're good with children,
she's rather taken with you.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.528
They're coming.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.121
We gotta go!

01:55.240 --> 01:57.320
Nick, they're Hundjagers!
They're coming to kill you.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.964
Let's go! Come on!
Let's go!

01:59.040 --> 02:00.121
No!

02:21.560 --> 02:22.840
All right, let's go.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.291
They're gone.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.925
Find them!

02:45.880 --> 02:46.927
I'm going back.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.367
Hold on. There's more people out there.
It'd be suicide.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.400
Hey, he's right.
We gotta keep moving, Nick.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.766
Hold on, come on now.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.564
They're not
the ones responsible.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.324
We have to find
the ones that ordered this.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.050
The Hundjager
I killed was Verrat.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.041
It's the Royals, Nick.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.080
What'd you do with the one you killed?
I hid the body.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.125
Show me.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.166
I'll have Wu meet us.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.731
What is this place?

03:45.680 --> 03:46.920
It's a rental.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.570
He followed me here.
That's him.

03:58.960 --> 03:59.961
He say anything?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.041
No time to.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.922
Soon as I saw he was a
Hundjager I didn't wait.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.001
What'd you do with the head?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.081
I kicked it under there.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.681
Still there.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.171
We need to find these guys.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.760
Adalind might
know where they are.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.326
Adalind? The Adalind?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.125
Just get the head.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.847
What are you thinking?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.610
This guy's Verrat, he was
working with the Royals.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.205
I think we can use
him to find them.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.760
He's kinda dead,
Nick, I don't think

04:34.800 --> 04:37.121
he's going to be
answering any questions.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.241
What's going on?

04:44.320 --> 04:45.481
The Royals killed Nick's mom.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.961
What?

04:47.040 --> 04:48.166
Open the trunk.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.771
I'm sorry, Nick.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.166
Trubel.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.889
Is that?
A head.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.805
So you wanna call it in?
No.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.245
We're doing this my way.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.723
I can't believe they shot me
with rubber bullets.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.370
Well, we had to
make whatever was

05:40.440 --> 05:43.171
inside you think
he was really dying.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.726
Otherwise he might
not have left you.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.007
And if it really
was Jack the Ripper,

05:48.080 --> 05:49.764
he was from the 1800s,
so he would have

05:49.840 --> 05:52.207
known about guns,
but not rubber bullets.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.442
So, he would have thought
he was really getting shot.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.325
And I was  really getting shot.
Those things hurt.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.765
Take this, you'll feel better.

05:59.120 --> 06:03.091
I'm just glad he bought it and went
back to wherever he came from.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.925
Wherever the hell that is.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.641
I still killed three women.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.962
That wasn't you.
Mmm.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.440
And I'm in charge
of finding the killer.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.200
I've got half
the Precinct looking for him.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.403
Well, they never found
the real Jack the Ripper.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.520
They're not going to stop
until they find somebody.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.810
That's a problem.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.811
You need a somebody.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.883
Bud, it's us,
open up the door.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.491
Don't you guys ever sleep?

06:45.520 --> 06:46.567
Trubel!

06:46.640 --> 06:47.926
Hey, Bud.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.641
I like your bat.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.446
When'd you get back?

06:51.520 --> 06:54.729
I mean, welcome back, it's good to see
you, like really good to see you.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.529
Where's Adalind?
She's asleep.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.806
I need to talk to her.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.245
About what?

07:01.320 --> 07:02.526
The Royals have Diana.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.364
What? I thought she
was with your mother.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.521
My mother's dead.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.806
Kelly's dead?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.291
Oh, Nick...

07:08.440 --> 07:10.010
I'm going to kill
whoever did this.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.045
That would be Kenneth.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.447
He took over when the King
recalled Viktor to Vienna.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.363
And Rispoli. He's in
charge of the Verrat.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.521
Where were the Royals staying?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.443
Here, at the Penthouse
at the Hotel deluxe.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.601
Do you think
they're still there?

07:20.680 --> 07:21.761
Well, they couldn't have known

07:21.840 --> 07:23.285
they'd get Diana tonight.
Nick, I want her back.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.486
Can you get into the Penthouse?

07:24.560 --> 07:25.971
I think I still have the key.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.486
All right. Get ready. We need
you to drop something off.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.201
Okay.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.165
She's pregnant?

07:32.840 --> 07:33.966
It's mine.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.929
Nick, the Royals
aren't gonna stop.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.240
They could come looking for
you at Monroe and Rosalee's.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.805
He's right.
They want you dead.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.049
We need to warn
Monroe and Rosalee.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
I'll call 'em.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.765
No. Bring them back here.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.006
Do have any plastic wrap?

07:47.080 --> 07:48.445
Plas... What?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.568
Is this really my granddaughter?

07:55.800 --> 07:56.801
It is.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.890
I can hardly believe it.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.404
Look how much she's grown
in such a short time.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.250
She truly is special.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.325
May I present
Ms. Juliette Silverton,

08:07.400 --> 08:09.480
without whose help this would
not have been possible.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.969
Juliette, this is
King Frederick Von Co...

08:12.040 --> 08:13.769
That's plenty.

08:15.960 --> 08:20.363
I cannot thank you enough. You
will be well taken care of.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.920
A whole new life
awaits you in Vienna.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.163
I've always had a soft
spot for Hexenbiests.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.924
Look at you.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.522
You are so beautiful.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.123
Come give your
grandfather a hug.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.844
Oh!

08:48.920 --> 08:52.527
How I have longed
to hold this child.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.847
At last where she belongs...

09:00.440 --> 09:03.011
You've made me
a very happy old man.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.768
Feed and bathe her,
dress her properly.

09:05.880 --> 09:06.961
Your Majesty.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.451
Be sure she's ready to travel.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.601
Come, Diana.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.409
It's Rispoli.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.609
Put him on speaker, he should
be part of our celebration.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.289
You're on speaker with the King.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.806
He would like to congratulate
you on a job well done.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.286
We've had a setback.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.486
The Grimm got away.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.641
Where is he?

09:27.720 --> 09:30.121
We don't know, we're
searching the area now.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.406
Well, clear everyone out.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.881
Meet me back at the hotel
and we'll deal with this.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.047
I promise, I'll take
care of the Grimm.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.646
I suggest you keep that promise.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.680
Where would he be?

09:48.720 --> 09:49.767
He's looking for me.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.841
Then you're coming with me.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.046
She stays here.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.406
She's done her job,
now you do yours.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.326
So, what is this Grimm like?

10:11.760 --> 10:13.364
He won't stop.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.571
Hello?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.405
Is anyone here?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.680
It's really good
you got here when you did.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.006
I guess so.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.686
Oh, I'm serious. Nick
really needs you right now.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.809
I just can't believe
they killed his mother.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.685
It was pretty awful.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.486
What about Josh? Is he still with us?
I mean, he's not...

11:28.600 --> 11:30.284
He's okay.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.049
Huh, it must be you.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.166
Aren't you gonna get it?
I mean, what if it's Nick?

11:47.440 --> 11:48.805
- Nick.
- We need to talk.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.042
Yeah, we're on our
way there, Bud's driving.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.360
I'll be in touch.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.886
No.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.051
I'll call you when
we get back to his house

11:56.120 --> 11:57.560
and when Monroe
and Rosalee are safe.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.562
See, it was Nick. Just
makin' sure we're okay.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.170
...anyone in
a three-mile radius.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.649
Captain, I'm glad you're back.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.331
What have we got?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.960
Our first lead on
the "Ripper" killings.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.560
Show me.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.321
We thought
we were at a dead end.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.004
The first two murders
were prostitutes,

12:22.080 --> 12:23.570
killed in same the vicinity
where they worked.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.886
Then there's the third murder.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.240
And we can't find any connection

12:26.280 --> 12:27.486
between this one
and the first two.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.647
Except the way she was killed.

12:28.720 --> 12:29.846
Then we got a break.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.604
There was a fourth attack
tonight, in the same area

12:31.680 --> 12:32.806
where these two
bodies were found.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.763
Who reported it? The
victim, Judith Nichols,

12:34.840 --> 12:35.921
another working girl.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.920
- She give a description?
- A pretty good one.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.648
Tall, 6'4 ", 6'5",
well dressed, slender.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.881
Anything else?

12:42.960 --> 12:44.041
Yeah, and you're gonna
love this.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.088
What?
He has a British accent.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.850
Guy
thought he was Jack the Ripper.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.921
So how'd she get away?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.240
This is the weird part.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.805
Three men came to her rescue,

12:51.880 --> 12:54.850
one of them wearing what she
thought was a police uniform,

12:54.960 --> 12:56.450
but it was probably
a security guard

12:56.520 --> 12:58.488
'cause there's no record of
this guy getting arrested.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.846
Yeah, I don't know, maybe
they took the creep out

12:59.920 --> 13:01.046
and beat him to death.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.610
Not that we think
that's a good thing.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.010
Well, keep me posted.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.405
I swear to God, if I have to cut
up another body for a potion...

13:12.560 --> 13:14.210
Or heal the Captain
one more time...

13:14.720 --> 13:16.449
Let's drink to something.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.681
To something.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.280
You know, we still
haven't heard from Nick.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.085
Or Trubel.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.686
We should call him.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.410
Yeah, you're right.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.326
Except
the phone's way over there.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.281
Monroe, Rosalee, it's Trubel.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.646
And me, Bud,
I'm with her.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.251
What's wrong?
A lot.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.320
They killed Nick's mom.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.448
Hundjagers
working for the Royals.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.201
They have the kid.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.805
Oh, my God, no.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.927
Where's Nick?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.764
Looking for 'em. We gotta
get you two out of here.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.201
You can stay at my house, 'cause
nobody really cares about me.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.847
I mean, not that nobody cares, but
the Royals don't even know who I am!

14:06.920 --> 14:08.684
I mean,
I don't think they do.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.761
Oh, my God, you don't
think they could...

14:09.840 --> 14:11.171
No, Bud. They don't even
know about me.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.366
How would they know about you?

14:12.440 --> 14:13.487
Let's go.
You're right, you're right.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.527
We're both under the radar.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.204
Which is why I think we should
get the hell out of here.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.406
We should go.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.800
I got
plenty of toothbrushes.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.409
And then immediately
called security after that.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.527
And then, from there...
What've we got?

14:24.600 --> 14:25.931
Hey. Excuse me.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.526
Something pretty grisly.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.410
One of the guests
found a head in a closet.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.042
This is, uh, the hotel
manager, Mr. Adams.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.766
I'm Detective Burkhardt,
this is Detective Griffin.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.120
Who found it?

14:37.160 --> 14:39.162
One of our hotel guests,
Miss Schade.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.449
Housekeeping
heard her screaming,

14:41.520 --> 14:43.249
immediately
called hotel security.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.805
They notified me.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.610
I, uh, just can't believe it.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.484
Where's the guest?
Oh, right in here.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.610
Miss Schade, these are Detectives
Burkhardt and Griffin.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.167
Can you tell us what happened?

14:58.240 --> 15:00.846
I came back to my room, I'd
been gone a couple of days,

15:00.960 --> 15:03.645
and I opened the closet
door and there it was.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.324
It was awful.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.450
I'm pregnant, you know.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.524
We're going to need the names
and vehicle information

15:10.600 --> 15:11.886
of everyone who's
staying in this room.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.166
Right away.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.685
Security, I'm gonna need
you to pull some records.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.761
Copy that.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.887
You Okay?

15:16.960 --> 15:19.531
I almost went into labor
with all that screaming.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.647
Well, you did good.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.767
Looks like they
haven't packed up yet.

15:21.840 --> 15:22.887
Now what?

15:22.960 --> 15:24.610
Now we find out what
vehicles they're driving,

15:24.680 --> 15:26.728
put out arrest warrants
for Kenneth and Rispoli.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.165
It worked.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.040
There's a printout
of the names and vehicles

15:31.120 --> 15:32.360
waiting at the front desk.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.010
APB's on everything.
Yeah.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.202
Have an officer take Adalind back to Bud's.
You stay here.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.406
Yeah.

15:37.680 --> 15:42.083
Hey. I'm sorry about your mom.
I know how much that hurts.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.843
She died trying to
save my daughter.

15:52.360 --> 15:56.410
This must be difficult. Your
life changing so drastically.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.891
You must have loved your
Grimm, you sacrificed so much.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.525
I thought it was a sacrifice.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.640
I'm not so sure anymore.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.890
A Hexenbiest with your powers

16:11.000 --> 16:12.764
could be a very valuable asset

16:12.840 --> 16:15.002
to someone who respects them.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.881
Like you?

16:16.960 --> 16:20.248
My family has a long
history with Hexenbiests.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.040
We've always embraced
the very things

16:23.120 --> 16:25.566
for which others have
burned you at the stake.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.090
But I can imagine the confusion

16:30.160 --> 16:33.084
you've experienced
not being born to it.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.124
You're Sean's father.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.641
That is true.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.326
Just to be clear,
you tried to have both

16:39.400 --> 16:42.006
Sean and his Hexenbiest
mother killed.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.321
More than once.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.568
That was the Queen, not me.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.531
Well, if the Queen tries
anything like that with me...

16:58.000 --> 16:59.570
The Queen is dead.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.846
Good.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.521
You're beautiful.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.726
Any private plane.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.720
They should be traveling
with a very small child.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.087
All right.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.926
Gotta go.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.445
What is it?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.331
She was set up, Hank.

17:54.920 --> 17:55.967
My mother was smart,

17:56.040 --> 17:57.041
there's no way she
would've showed up

17:57.120 --> 17:58.690
if she didn't
think she was safe,

17:58.760 --> 17:59.800
especially with the child.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.000
Why would she come here at all?
You didn't contact her.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.931
Well, somebody did.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.604
And the only way could've
been from my computer...

18:06.680 --> 18:08.284
So who had access?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.211
Only me...

18:13.320 --> 18:14.651
And Juliette.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.561
Kelly would have trusted her.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.766
With her life.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.960
I think maybe she did, Nick.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.681
Officer...

18:27.520 --> 18:29.280
Kenneth Bowes-Lyon.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.486
Hands behind
your head! Now!

18:31.560 --> 18:33.130
Okay, okay.
Get down on the ground,

18:33.200 --> 18:34.361
all the way down, now!

18:34.440 --> 18:35.646
Get down!

18:36.880 --> 18:38.325
Hands behind your back.
Let's check him.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.447
Hold him.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.960
Do you have anything
in your pockets?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.240
I think there's been a mistake.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.611
Get him up, get him up.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.724
You have the right
to remain silent.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.285
Anything you say can and will be

18:49.360 --> 18:50.720
used against you
in a court of law.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.880
Keep driving.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.165
Get him in.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.522
Leaving Portland, are we?

19:00.600 --> 19:02.011
Our destination?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.249
Where are you taking me?

19:08.040 --> 19:09.405
Where you belong.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.806
I doubt that.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.050
Your Majesty.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.565
What happened?

19:23.680 --> 19:26.206
The police were waiting
for Kenneth at the hotel.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.845
He was set up by the Grimm.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.567
This Grimm is really
becoming annoying.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.768
Would you like me to go
back and get Kenneth out?

19:34.360 --> 19:35.486
No.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.686
Let the Grimm have him. They
both need a little closure.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.760
Get ready to go.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.766
Yes, Your Majesty.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.201
Get out.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.489
I take it this isn't
standard procedure.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.366
Lay down.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.040
If you're going to put a bullet in
the back of my head, just do it.

21:11.760 --> 21:15.367
I'd always heard how
badass you Grimms were,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.727
but your mother
was a complete letdown.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.170
Of course, I did have the
element of surprise on my side.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.485
How'd you get Juliette to help?

21:27.560 --> 21:29.528
She didn't take
that much convincing.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.283
One good romp in your bed.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.724
Well, let's just say her
needs weren't being met.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.127
Where is she?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.362
The King's delighted
to have his grandchild back.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.211
She'll be well rewarded.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.840
She's changed the course of
history, just so you know.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.565
Too bad you
won't live to see it.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.129
Okay. This is crazy.
I'm going back.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.770
No, no, no. This is
the way Nick wanted it.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.047
Okay, look, I'm sure
Nick can handle this guy,

22:20.120 --> 22:21.929
but he killed Nick's mom.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.520
What if he kills Nick?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.525
Then we finish what he started.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.887
For my mother.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.928
Juliette's with the Royals.
They have Adalind's kid.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.251
Get back to the Precinct.
Triangulate Juliette's cell.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.280
We need to get to them
before they're gone. On it.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.286
What do you want to
do about the body?

23:42.360 --> 23:43.760
Nothing.
We're going after Juliette.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.165
Hey, we're gonna
need some help on this.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.521
Last time you pulled a gun on
Juliette, it didn't go well.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.087
Trubel?
That's what I was thinking.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.531
I can't believe
Kelly got killed.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.045
How did that happen?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.363
I feel so bad for Nick.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.160
Were you with him when he
found his mother's body?

24:03.200 --> 24:04.565
Yeah. But it wasn't her body.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.521
What?

24:09.040 --> 24:10.963
They put her head in
a box for him to find.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.451
on, my God...
on...

24:13.240 --> 24:14.651
Oh, they're animals.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.803
Nick's gonna need us
now more than ever.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.041
And Juliette.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.120
Wait, shouldn't she be here?

24:20.240 --> 24:21.287
Nick didn't tell you?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.204
There were some side effects
to him getting his Grimm back.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.530
Yeah. I remember, but...

24:29.040 --> 24:30.963
Juliette's a Hexenbiest.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.121
No way.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.004
She torched the trailer
and almost killed Monroe.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.320
And me.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.811
I can't believe this.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.006
Believe it.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.846
Somebody's out there.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.086
It's Nick and Hank.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.851
Juliette's a Hexenbiest?
Yeah.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.126
And she's with the Royals.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
That bitch has my kid?

25:04.280 --> 25:05.520
She helped the Royals take her.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.763
We're going to need you on this.
You got it.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.960
Never should've left.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.280
Wu. I'm putting you
on speaker.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.000
I triangulated her cell.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.960
She's in North Plains,
outside our jurisdiction.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.764
I don't care.
Didn't think so.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.764
It's a big gated compound.
Only one road in.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.968
About a mile off the highway.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.081
You got an address?

25:23.160 --> 25:24.685
422 Mountain Estate Drive.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.728
I'll meet you there.
No. Not this time.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.444
It's too risky.
I don't want you getting

25:28.520 --> 25:30.090
pulled down with
what I have to do.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.529
Considering who's
in the compound,

25:36.600 --> 25:38.125
my guess is it's going
to be heavily guarded.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.326
How we going in?

25:39.720 --> 25:40.721
Quietly.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.926
We need some
things from the shop.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.240
Coming with you.
Me, too.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.367
Well, someone needs to stay here

25:44.480 --> 25:45.720
with Adalind and Bud.
Just in case.

25:45.800 --> 25:46.961
Yeah, yeah,
that's a really good idea.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.247
'Cause if anybody does come
here, it's just me and Adalind,

25:49.360 --> 25:50.885
and, you know, the little guy.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
I'll stay.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.571
You better come back.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.608
I'll be okay, I promise.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.650
How are you feeling?

26:07.720 --> 26:10.724
Tired, angry, scared.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.330
Now, which poison do you want?

26:16.800 --> 26:18.450
There's still
some Siegbarste Gift.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.050
That stuff'll take down an ogre,

26:20.120 --> 26:21.451
it'll take down
just about anything.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.851
Bring it.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.051
This is cool.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.491
What kind Of
weapon you gonna use?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.047
I'm good.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.681
Right.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.367
Nick, if we do find Juliette,
what do you want us to do?

26:48.480 --> 26:49.606
Kill her.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.051
Getting close, about a quarter of a mile.
We should pull off soon.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.407
Car behind us.
Coming in kind of fast.

27:11.440 --> 27:12.566
She's right.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.289
Let's pull over,
see what he does.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.610
Uh-oh.

27:36.680 --> 27:37.966
Not good.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.764
Let's not get caught in the car.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.846
Nick...

28:06.760 --> 28:08.649
I know you told
me not to do this,

28:08.720 --> 28:10.800
but after what they did to
your mom, I gotta be here.

28:11.680 --> 28:15.241
Just so you know,
I left my badge at home.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.606
I'm glad you came.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.966
How we doin' this?

28:18.960 --> 28:21.122
Leave the cars here.
We walk.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.600
And no noise.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.170
Could I still bring a shotgun?

28:28.880 --> 28:30.086
Just in case.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.641
You never know.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.766
Bring it.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.962
Jeez, Rosalee! Don't be
sneaking up on me like that.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.088
You need a break, I'll
take over for a while.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.049
Good idea, I'm a little jumpy.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.922
Say, uh, you know I've
been thinkin' about

29:07.000 --> 29:09.002
what's going to happen
once Adalind has her baby.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.411
So have I.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.247
Well. You think Adalind
and Nick are going to,

29:13.320 --> 29:16.005
like, you know,
move in together and...

29:16.520 --> 29:18.010
And get married? No.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.006
Oh, good, good. 'Cause I
don't think that'd work.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.888
I mean, Juliette was
just so right for Nick.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.889
The, uh, old Juliette,
not the crazy new one.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.920
I wonder what
they're gonna name the kid.

30:12.400 --> 30:17.440
And what do you say, we
put this one right there.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.210
What do you think, Princess?
Is this a beautiful castle?

30:26.720 --> 30:28.449
Well, that wasn't very nice.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.967
Oh!

30:48.040 --> 30:51.522
You are going to be
the builder of Kingdoms!

30:53.920 --> 30:55.081
Your Majesty.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.288
The pilot just reported
they are five minutes out.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.121
Time for us to go home, Diana.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.125
Take her, please.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.443
We're going to have
a nice ride to a big boat.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.600
Two guys
in front of the house.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.806
I hear something.

31:28.840 --> 31:29.921
I don't hear anything.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.331
Me either.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.526
That's gotta be their way out.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.124
Juliette is not
getting on the helicopter.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.330
Wu, take the knife.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.566
Downstairs.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.406
Oh, hell.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.563
If I'm not back in 60 seconds...

33:10.640 --> 33:12.051
We'll be gone.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.441
Hey!

34:39.960 --> 34:41.324
They're back.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.969
What happened?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.201
They got away.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.089
All of them?
They had a helicopter.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.685
You didn't get Diana?

34:53.679 --> 34:54.841
I'm sorry.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.209
What about Juliette?
Was she there?

34:59.200 --> 35:00.486
She got away, too.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.766
Oh, Nick...

35:02.360 --> 35:04.362
You can go back home now.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.410
What about me? Where
am I supposed to go?

35:10.640 --> 35:13.484
You stay here with Bud
till we wrap all this up.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.881
Nick.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.807
You go home.
I'll handle the Captain.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.760
Nick did everything he could,
but they got away.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.691
My father has Diana now.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.008
There's nothing
we can do about it.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.485
You tell Adalind?
Yeah.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.561
Good.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.285
I'm glad I don't have to, again.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.009
Captain, there's
a few bodies up there...

35:54.920 --> 35:56.604
It's out of our
jurisdiction, isn't it?

35:56.680 --> 35:57.681
Yeah.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.690
Shoot anybody?

35:59.800 --> 36:01.768
One. With a shotgun.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.926
Well, there's no ballistics,
nothing tying you to them, so...

36:06.080 --> 36:07.320
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.922
If it's any consolation,
Kenneth is dead.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.448
Well, that is some consolation.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.160
I still have to deal
with what I did, though.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.046
But that was Jack.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.851
Yeah, but I can't explain it
and they won't stop looking.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.240
What we need is a suspect
that's about your height.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.763
With a British accent.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.604
What are the chances
of finding that?

36:50.760 --> 36:55.641
We're going on a big ship across
the ocean and take you home.

36:56.440 --> 37:00.161
You know,
you really are a princess.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.605
What do you see?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.525
What? What is it?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.685
What...
Get your hands off me.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.925
I am the King!

37:42.800 --> 37:44.370
One more push! Here it is!

37:44.520 --> 37:45.726
Here it is!

37:55.280 --> 37:56.691
Down with the King.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.451
He'll make a good Jack.

38:20.040 --> 38:23.010
I just wish I could tell him
how much I appreciate this.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.765
Maybe Jack'll tell him.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.560
I didn't know
Kenneth was going to do that.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.770
She trusted you.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.931
I know.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.843
I thought they
just wanted Diana.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.126
You betrayed her!

39:48.960 --> 39:50.610
Do it, Nick.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.731
Kill me.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.845
Just do it.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.531
Do it.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.682
You can't put me out
of your misery, huh?

40:19.560 --> 40:22.080
I hope you're not going to tell
me you're still in love with me.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.366
Get out.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.965
After everything
I've done for you,

40:25.040 --> 40:26.720
you think that's how
we're going to end it?

40:29.080 --> 40:31.242
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.442
I'm done fighting, Juliette.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.965
Maybe I still love you.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.407
Maybe that's something
that just never goes away.

40:59.920 --> 41:02.287
I'm done.
I know.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.450
I wish I was.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.200
Goodbye, Nick.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.606
Goodbye, Juliette.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.090
No. No!

41:21.880 --> 41:23.245
No! Juliette!

41:31.160 --> 41:32.241
Nick.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.042
Juliette! No!

41:47.480 --> 41:49.608
No!

42:15.760 --> 42:17.125
Get her!
