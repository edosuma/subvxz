WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:05.440
Happy anniversary, Claire.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.050
Aw. You, too, babe.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.443
I love you. Mwah!

00:08.486 --> 00:09.922
Can I pour you
some champagne?

00:09.966 --> 00:11.881
Uh, that depends.
Is it grocery store champagne,

00:11.924 --> 00:13.709
or did you steal it from Cooper?

00:13.752 --> 00:16.146
Stole it from Cooper.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.147
Yeah!

00:17.191 --> 00:18.409
Fancy!

00:18.453 --> 00:20.020
Happy anniversary, guys.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.934
I, um, I got you
a little something.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.632
Aw, Cooper.

00:23.675 --> 00:27.157
I'm just gonna quickly
peek out into the driveway...

00:29.116 --> 00:34.121
...and be just as excited
for our non-drivable gift.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.948
What is it, buddy?

00:35.992 --> 00:38.081
Well, I was doing
my own laundry...

00:41.171 --> 00:44.653
Sorry, people usually applaud
when I say things like that.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.089
Anyway, I
found a copy

00:46.133 --> 00:48.787
of your old vows in some
wadded-up tuxedo pants.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.920
Oh. I guess
the rental guy was right.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.704
I did notreturn
those pants.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.184
And they were

00:54.228 --> 00:56.143
so beautifully written up,
I thought it would be nice

00:56.186 --> 00:58.362
to blow them up and
print them on canvas.

00:58.406 --> 01:02.236
Oh, my God.Aw. That's amazing.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.760
And when I was down there,
I also found a set of bagpipes

01:04.803 --> 01:06.370
stashed in a cupboard
behind the detergent.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.416
Oh, yeah.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.505
Jake got his 23andMe results

01:10.548 --> 01:14.813
and found out
he is 0.5% Scottish.

01:15.901 --> 01:18.556
Oh, don't be so jealous,
ya wee clipe.

01:20.471 --> 01:23.126
Yeah, that accent was
0.5% Scottish.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.345
CLAIRE:
Yeah, well,

01:24.388 --> 01:26.956
luckily, at our wedding,
Jake vowed to...

01:26.999 --> 01:29.132
never play them again,
and in exchange,

01:29.176 --> 01:32.266
I vowed to never do
the Dougie again.

01:32.309 --> 01:35.269
It's a dance
I got a little obsessed with.

01:35.312 --> 01:38.272
A little? You did it at
your uncle's funeral.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.100
His name was Dougie!

01:41.231 --> 01:43.625
Happy anniversary!I didn't see anything

01:43.668 --> 01:45.627
in the driveway,
so I'm assuming

01:45.670 --> 01:47.411
Cooper's gift
is stuck in customs

01:47.455 --> 01:50.588
because the steering wheel is
on the wrong side of the car?

01:50.632 --> 01:54.288
No. Cooper got us
a very thoughtful gift.

01:54.331 --> 01:58.074
Oh. Did he donate to
whales or something?

01:59.336 --> 02:01.730
Hey, you guys brought
champagne for us?

02:01.773 --> 02:03.253
Yes.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.908
That is totally
for you guys.

02:07.301 --> 02:10.782
Honey, why don't you pop that
unopened bottle of champagne?

02:10.826 --> 02:12.088
Okay.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.135
Oh-ho!

02:15.178 --> 02:16.527
Ooh! Ah!Whoa.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.355
Get the glasses.

02:18.399 --> 02:19.835
Whoo-hoo!

02:19.878 --> 02:21.315
Yeah.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.581
To Jake and Claire!

02:29.366 --> 02:32.587
♪ Imagine me and you, I do

02:32.630 --> 02:35.372
♪ I think about you
day and night ♪

02:35.416 --> 02:37.200
♪ It's only right

02:37.244 --> 02:39.985
♪ So happy together...

02:53.347 --> 02:56.176
Wow, man, framing our vows
was a great gift, Cooper.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.221
I mean, a new Lexus wouldn't
have been nearly as homemade.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.049
Yeah.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.616
I just love how,
instead of using

03:01.659 --> 03:03.008
the same old boring clichés,

03:03.052 --> 03:04.314
like honoring and cherishing
each other,

03:04.358 --> 03:06.055
you guys personalized your vows.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.839
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We got super specific.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.580
'Cause we didn't want
to fight all the time,
like my parents did.

03:09.624 --> 03:12.279
Yeah. So we always vowed
to never go to sleep

03:12.322 --> 03:13.932
without resolving
our issues,

03:13.976 --> 03:15.369
and always having
each other's back.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.197
Yep. And my lady vowed to:

03:17.240 --> 03:18.850
"always celebrate
my quirks."

03:21.026 --> 03:23.246
Though sometimes it is hard
to tell the difference

03:23.290 --> 03:26.031
between a quirk
and a major personality flaw.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.208
Mm.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.340
Man, I wish my parents had done
this-- it might've stopped them

03:30.384 --> 03:31.863
from getting divorced
when I was young.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.691
Aw, sorry to hear that,
Coops. Mine, too.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.216
Play a lot of catch
in the backyard by yourself?

03:36.259 --> 03:38.870
Yeah, but it was with a
boomerang, so it wasn't too bad.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.308
Oh.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.048
It's weird,
but I can't help feeling

03:43.092 --> 03:44.485
like I caused
my parents' divorce.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.095
Oh, come on.
All kids feel that way.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.966
But you got to know
it's not true.
I know.

03:48.010 --> 03:50.534
It's just, when I was 11,
I pulled this prank on my mom

03:50.578 --> 03:52.710
and told her my dad
was having an affair and...

03:55.147 --> 03:56.366
...you know,
instead of laughing,

03:56.410 --> 03:58.760
she had revenge sex
with his boss.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.283
And then, like,

04:00.327 --> 04:03.243
three weeks later
they were divorced.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.941
Uh...

04:08.117 --> 04:09.727
I-I-I mean,

04:09.771 --> 04:11.381
you-you can't...

04:11.425 --> 04:14.297
Are pranks different
in Australia?

04:14.341 --> 04:15.864
My point is that you two

04:15.907 --> 04:17.866
are the perfect
relationship role models for me.

04:17.909 --> 04:20.216
But seriously, I'm so
inspired that I think

04:20.260 --> 04:21.826
I'm gonna write
my first love ballad.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.480
Ah, Cooper, those
vows may seem nice,

04:23.524 --> 04:26.353
but you didn't have to watch
these two stumble over them

04:26.396 --> 04:29.181
while ugly crying.

04:29.225 --> 04:32.489
I vow... to make
our wedding ceremony

04:32.533 --> 04:35.231
three hours longer
than it needs to be.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.409
Even though all
of our guests

04:39.453 --> 04:42.107
just want to rip shots
at the open bar.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.807
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.896
Make your jokes,
all right?

04:47.939 --> 04:49.550
But I'll have you
know Claire and I

04:49.593 --> 04:51.552
are killing this
marriage thing.
CLAIRE:
Yeah.

04:51.595 --> 04:54.337
You know, thanks to these
bad boys, we are four years in,

04:54.381 --> 04:56.774
and we've never had
an actual fight.GERALD: Wow.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.298
A whole four years.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.473
If your marriage was
a bottle of wine,

04:59.516 --> 05:02.040
it'd be, like, 12 bucks.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.915
And by the way,

05:06.958 --> 05:08.612
it is healthy
for couples to fight.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.353
We've been married
for 30 years--

05:10.397 --> 05:11.485
we fight all the time.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.138
We don't fight all
the time.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.750
Not in front of the kids.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.360
You're right.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.753
I'm sorry.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.320
I'm sorry, too. Oh.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.767
Oh, wow, babe.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.377
We crushed that
anniversary dinner.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.987
Ooh, yeah.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.467
We really should stop
this tradition of eating

05:37.511 --> 05:39.991
a seafood tower for every
year we've been married.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.428
Oh, yeah.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.299
Oh, my God.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.953
Look at how
this guy parked.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.781
What a jerk.
Hey, now.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.217
Let's not assume
it was a guy.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.393
Ladies can be bad
at stuff, too.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.048
Nope, tried to say something
good and it came out bad.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.006
You know, we should
leave a nasty note.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.486
Give me that dinner receipt.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.401
But it has my name on it.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.708
And proof that I have
a Discover card.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.188
Ugh. He's not gonna
read the receipt.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.277
Yeah, you're right.
And even if he does,

06:05.321 --> 06:07.279
you know how many Jake Davises
there are in this city?

06:07.323 --> 06:11.501
17. And not one has responded
to a friend request.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.286
Ooh, girl.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.592
Get nasty with it.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.464
Okay. I see you.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.422
Very colorful language,
my dear.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.989
Claire.

06:21.032 --> 06:24.427
"If you thought you knew how
to park, you're wrong, you... "

06:24.471 --> 06:27.778
Oh, that says "can't."
Oh.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.566
And delivered.

06:34.350 --> 06:37.048
Well, guess we got to
go through the back door.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.920
It is our anniversary.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.624
All right.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.670
There we go.
Oh.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.849
Ooh. Climbing into the car
through the butt

06:54.892 --> 06:57.155
was a pretty good workout.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.462
Well, you know what else
is a good workout...

06:59.506 --> 07:00.855
Swimming.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.381
Oh, wait.
Are you coming on to me?

07:07.470 --> 07:11.039
Leaving that nasty note got me
feeling a little nasty myself.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.476
Oh. Claire,

07:13.520 --> 07:16.436
you dirty dog.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.481
We know we have
the house to ourselves,

07:18.525 --> 07:20.831
which means we can have
some good ol' fashioned

07:20.875 --> 07:23.834
♪ couch sex, baby
this evening ♪
Yeah.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.967
♪ I need some couch sex ♪ Baby, tonight.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.186
Wait. Is that the receipt
that I wrote my note on?

07:28.230 --> 07:30.493
What? This?

07:30.537 --> 07:31.929
No. No. This is, uh...

07:31.973 --> 07:33.365
This is-- I was just
practicing origami.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.497
It's, uh...

07:35.672 --> 07:37.500
Oh.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.197
Messed up another one.
Guess I got to eat it.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.460
What?

07:40.503 --> 07:41.417
Drop it.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.464
Drop it. Drop it.

07:45.552 --> 07:49.294
Huh. Wow.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.209
So you took my note
off the windshield?

07:51.253 --> 07:54.430
Yes.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.737
That's interesting,

07:56.780 --> 07:58.956
because I seem to recall
reading somewhere

07:59.000 --> 08:01.306
that you vowed
to always have my back.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.745
Where was that?
Oh, yeah. Ba-bam!

08:08.575 --> 08:12.230
Claire, taking that note
was having your back,

08:12.274 --> 08:14.363
because now that guy won't
see it and be all like...

08:21.631 --> 08:23.285
"I didn't mean it."
"Yes, you did."

08:32.773 --> 08:35.210
That's him hitting on you
because he knows

08:35.253 --> 08:36.690
you're a beautiful woman
and any murderer

08:36.733 --> 08:38.953
would be lucky
to have you as a wife.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.956
Where are you going?
To bed.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.567
No. Eh, not so fast,
Claire-io Andretti.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.614
I seem to recall
reading somewhere

08:47.657 --> 08:50.791
that we vowed to never go to bed
without resolving our issues.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.662
I wonder where I read that.

08:52.706 --> 08:56.231
Oh, yeah. Ba-bam!

08:56.274 --> 08:57.711
There's nothing to resolve.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.582
You didn't have my back,
and I'm tired.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.888
Well, we...

09:00.931 --> 09:02.846
we can't go to bed
unless I feel resolved

09:02.890 --> 09:04.631
and I do not
feel resolved!

09:04.674 --> 09:07.547
Claire!

09:07.590 --> 09:09.244
Well, joke's on you, Claire.

09:09.287 --> 09:12.682
I can have sex on this couch
even without you.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.778
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
do anything.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.394
I'm up late.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.396
Actually, I'm up late.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.616
I'm up late.
Hey.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.444
You're up early.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.663
Actually, I'm uplate.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.666
No. Over-rehearsed it.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.016
Wait. Did you stay up all night?

09:42.059 --> 09:43.539
I didn't want to.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.889
I had to,
because I don't break our vows.

09:45.933 --> 09:49.850
Husband, one;
wife, zero.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.635
What did you even do
for eight hours?

09:52.679 --> 09:54.463
I, uh, watched
Saving Private Ryan,

09:54.506 --> 09:56.378
then accidentally signed up
for the army.

09:56.421 --> 09:59.468
Uh, got scared and unplugged
the modem.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.078
Hmm.

10:01.122 --> 10:05.169
Well, Jake, I guess
I should say I'm sorry...

10:05.213 --> 10:06.997
that you felt the need
to stay up all night

10:07.041 --> 10:09.478
to prove your silly point.

10:09.521 --> 10:12.133
Is that really
how you talk to someone

10:12.176 --> 10:13.569
who might be a member

10:13.613 --> 10:15.571
of the United States
Armed Forces?Oh, my God.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.529
Might be-- You know what?
Now you're acting crazy.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.530
Apologize for real.

10:18.574 --> 10:19.836
What's the point
of apologizing?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.533
Hiya, guys.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.274
Hey. What's going on?Oh, hi.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.754
Will you stop?

10:24.798 --> 10:26.495
What do you think of this lyric
from my new love ballad?

10:26.538 --> 10:29.150
Uh, "I love all your quirks,
it's why we work.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.543
"Now, girl,
break it down for me.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.937
Twerk, twerk, twerk."

10:38.028 --> 10:39.464
It's amazing.
I love it.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.553
As you were, lovebirds.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.644
Ugh. Well, we can't fight
in front of Cooper,

10:44.687 --> 10:48.038
'cause he looks up
to our perfect marriage.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.518
We're not fighting,
all right?

10:49.561 --> 10:51.172
And we never will as
long as you promise

10:51.215 --> 10:52.956
to never break another
one of our vows.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.566
Well, you broke
the first vow

10:54.610 --> 10:56.351
when you didn't have
my back last night.

11:00.790 --> 11:04.272
I'm laughing because,
clearly, that was a joke.

11:04.315 --> 11:07.144
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go to work.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.493
Ugh. You know what?

11:08.537 --> 11:10.365
Have fun nodding off
at your desk, ya big baby.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.627
Oh, I will.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.194
And every time I do,
I'll know it's my body

11:13.237 --> 11:15.239
telling me how right I am.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.110
You are correct, sir.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.329
Yes, you are right.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.070
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

11:20.114 --> 11:21.681
Well, I vowed
to always leave you with a kiss

11:21.724 --> 11:23.508
and I wouldn't want to be
the secondperson

11:23.552 --> 11:24.858
to break one of our vows.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.077
No, no, no, no. That's,
that's an angry kiss.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.339
I do not do anger kisses.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.601
No, it's not an angry kiss.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.690
It's a self-righteous kiss

11:30.733 --> 11:32.517
and it's gonna taste
like you're wrong.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.694
No. No. No. I don't--

11:34.737 --> 11:36.521
Stop. You're
Pepé Le Pew-ing me.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.740
I don't want it.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.568
Hey.

11:39.611 --> 11:42.876
Hey.

11:42.919 --> 11:43.790
What's going on, guys?

11:43.833 --> 11:45.617
Oh, I was just
honoring my vow

11:45.661 --> 11:48.272
to always leave Jake
with a kiss, so...

11:48.316 --> 11:49.578
Mm-hmm.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.633
Thank you, dear.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.810
My God, your love
is so inspiring.

12:03.853 --> 12:08.423
"You, you leave you with a kiss,
so you know my love is true.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.642
"And-and when you get home,

12:10.686 --> 12:14.037
I'm gonna Pepé Le-do you."

12:16.953 --> 12:18.476
It's amazing.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.000
Cooper,
you did it again, man.Thank you.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.566
How does he do it?
Right?

12:45.242 --> 12:47.505
Mm.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.773
Husband, one; wife, one.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.046
Oh.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.657
Hitting the old mahogany
mattress, were we?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.790
I must have dozed off.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.226
Ah, it's okay, Jake.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.576
Stories about my susceptibility
to lightning strikes

13:14.619 --> 13:16.621
can be a little boring.

13:16.665 --> 13:17.622
No, no. I'm sorry.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.276
I... I just had a rough night.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.670
Don't apologize. I fall asleep
at work all the time.

13:21.713 --> 13:25.979
Managing a pop star
is a 24/7/365 job.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.763
Well, 364.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.158
I take off Secretaries Day
to honor my late mother.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.159
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.856
Thank you. She's never on time.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.031
It's so annoying.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.904
So what happened?

13:37.947 --> 13:40.080
Claire and I had a bit
of an argument.Mm-hmm.

13:40.123 --> 13:43.083
You know, one thing I know
about marriage

13:43.126 --> 13:46.651
is that it is all about winning
and losing.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.871
I may not have a house,

13:48.915 --> 13:51.918
a car, or children that talk
to me, but I have my pride.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.007
Four and oh, baby.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.226
I gotta go talk to Claire.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.402
No, Jake. You have
to talk atClaire.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.708
Don't let her
get a word in.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.275
Make her know
how you feel.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.499
Oh, yeah.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.110
Oh, yeah?

14:10.153 --> 14:12.764
Oh, yeah.

14:12.808 --> 14:16.420
Babe, I had some time to
think, and, uh, I'm sorry.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.553
Oh, yeah? Well, you have
a stupid, weird-shaped--

14:18.596 --> 14:19.989
Wait. What?
What?

14:22.992 --> 14:24.124
Did you just apologize?

14:24.167 --> 14:25.908
Yeah. You know,

14:25.952 --> 14:28.563
I-I realized marriage isn't
about winning and losing.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.652
Those vows were a
really sweet gift idea.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.088
Let's not ruin it
by arguing about them.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.830
Oh, I'm sorry, too.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.877
You know, why don't you
go in the kitchen and, uh,

14:37.920 --> 14:39.269
pour us two glasses
of champagne

14:39.313 --> 14:41.837
and we can celebrate
the end of this non-fight?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.057
Ooh, I likey.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.583
Oh, my God.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.324
Oh. No. No. No.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.116
Oh.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.950
What are you doing?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.648
Wanna have sex?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.827
All the time.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.568
Wait a minute,
that was too easy.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.353
What are you
hiding, Claire?

15:19.396 --> 15:20.832
Nothing.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.922
Then why are you
blocking when I...I'm not. Just...

15:22.965 --> 15:24.880
when I'm trying to...When-- Oh. Oh.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.013
Oh, my God!

15:27.056 --> 15:28.188
What?!

15:28.231 --> 15:29.841
What?
Oh, my God.

15:29.885 --> 15:33.367
Someone broke in
and vandalized our gift.

15:33.410 --> 15:37.719
Did you cross out
one of my vows?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.721
Okay, yes.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.897
I was really upset
when you left and...

15:41.941 --> 15:44.117
I didn't know you were gonna
come back and apologize,

15:44.160 --> 15:46.771
but look, I can,
I can fix it right now. Look.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.773
That... and then you...

15:48.817 --> 15:51.385
Eh? See? I signed it
like you do at the bank

15:51.428 --> 15:53.953
when you handle
important business.

15:55.824 --> 15:59.175
Do not try to turn me on
with sexy bank talk, all right?

15:59.219 --> 16:01.961
I kept that vow.
I keep all of our vows.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.660
Oh, please. So you really
"treat me like a queen"?

16:05.703 --> 16:08.663
Well, not literally,
but now that you mention it,

16:08.706 --> 16:10.578
would you like me to remove
that scepter

16:10.621 --> 16:14.495
from thine butt?

16:14.538 --> 16:16.410
Well, in that case,

16:16.453 --> 16:18.890
off with your head...
privileges.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.023
O-Okay. All right.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.807
Oh, I'll play this game.
I can play this game.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.418
How 'bout how you...

16:24.461 --> 16:26.986
promise to "always celebrate
my quirks," huh?

16:27.029 --> 16:29.901
Well, I don't feel very
celebrated right now.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.991
Oh. Well, let's,

16:32.034 --> 16:34.341
let's have a
party for them.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.082
You know, let's start
with how you always

16:36.125 --> 16:38.519
have to do an open-mouth
smile for every picture.

16:38.562 --> 16:42.305
I don't open-mouth smile
for every...

16:42.349 --> 16:45.526
Oh.
Or how you have to save

16:45.569 --> 16:47.789
every single receipt
that you've every gotten.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.965
Let's have a little party
for them, too, right?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.968
Yay! Yay!
Oh, my gosh!

16:53.012 --> 16:54.839
You're mixing deductible
categories.

16:54.883 --> 16:57.494
We're gonna go to jail.
Are you crazy?

16:57.538 --> 16:59.409
Oh, my gosh.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.020
Ugh.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.414
Well, since no one's taking
our vows seriously anymore,

17:04.458 --> 17:07.548
I guess I'll do a little
something like this.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.427
I hope you're in the
mood for an instrument

17:17.471 --> 17:21.562
I like to call the
devil's testicle.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.085
Oh, my God.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
It sounds terrible.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.090
Yeah, Claire.
It's the bagpipes.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.092
Oh, great.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.051
You know what?
Keep playing,

17:32.094 --> 17:34.444
'cause it's getting me in
the mood for a little dancing.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.185
Oh, you better not Dougie.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.058
Oh, I'm about to Dougie.
I'm about to Dougie.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.276
What? Ah.
Don't you dare.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.105
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.160
What are you guys doing?

17:54.203 --> 17:55.987
What does it look like
we're doing?!

17:56.031 --> 17:57.989
Um...

18:00.514 --> 18:02.211
I honestly don't know.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.909
We're having
our first fight.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.563
And I hope you
finished your love song

18:06.607 --> 18:08.696
because our vows are
a bunch of crap.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.742
This is my fault, isn't it?

18:11.786 --> 18:13.788
No, it's Jake's.No, it's Claire's.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.923
Oh, my God.

18:18.967 --> 18:22.927
Someone broke in
and vandalized my gift.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.853
Couldn't sleep?

18:35.897 --> 18:37.942
Yep.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.857
Turns out it was only 4:00
in the afternoon

18:39.901 --> 18:41.772
when I stormed upstairs.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.690
And, uh, it felt weird
to come back down here

18:46.734 --> 18:49.171
so I pretended to read a book.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.782
What book?

18:51.826 --> 18:54.307
I don't know. I was pretending.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.266
COOPER:
Jake and Claire!
Could you guys come

18:57.310 --> 18:58.572
into the living room,
please?

19:01.227 --> 19:04.055
Oh, my gosh, Claire,
are you okay?

19:04.099 --> 19:06.580
Why'd you say she was having
a heart attack?

19:08.016 --> 19:10.975
Gotcha.

19:11.019 --> 19:14.109
Anyway, these guys
were having a big fight

19:14.153 --> 19:15.589
and I thought you guys
could help.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.982
Yeah, a fight I thought was
between myself, my wife

19:18.026 --> 19:20.811
and an unrelated boy
who lives in our attic.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.726
Well, look, I'm sorry,
but I feel so bad

19:22.770 --> 19:24.163
my gift caused you guys
to fight.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.382
This is why I usually
just give people cars.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.210
Seriously?

19:28.254 --> 19:29.951
Anyway, I figured
Bonnie and Gerald

19:29.994 --> 19:31.822
have been married for 30 years,
maybe they could help.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.260
Ugh. Okay, look,
I know you guys think

19:34.303 --> 19:36.392
that our vows
are ridiculous,

19:36.436 --> 19:38.220
but we are trying
our best to live up to them.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.135
But that's the problem.
You wrote these fancy vows

19:40.179 --> 19:42.093
that sound amazing,
but at the end of the day

19:42.137 --> 19:43.704
they're impossible
to live up to.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.880
You guys just set
too many rules.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.144
It's a marriage,
not an orgy.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.759
Look, think about it.
Your wedding day is the day

19:55.803 --> 19:57.413
you know the least
about your marriage,

19:57.457 --> 20:00.242
so making promises then is just
setting yourself up for failure.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.244
That's why you always stick
with the hits:

20:02.288 --> 20:03.550
good times, bad times,

20:03.593 --> 20:04.855
sickness, health,

20:04.899 --> 20:07.162
burial or cremation.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.859
Cremation.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.471
Burn, baby, burn.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.473
You know, I think
they're right.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.301
Like, I don't want to be in
a marriage based on rules

20:15.344 --> 20:17.172
we set up years ago.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.956
I want to grow
and evolve with you.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.784
Aw.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.873
Me, too.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.179
Ew.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.752
Wow.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.102
That was amazing.
Mm.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.973
God, I can't believe
we've been missing out

20:36.017 --> 20:37.932
on make-up sex
all these years.

20:37.975 --> 20:40.717
I know. Stupid
loving relationship.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.284
Well, you know
what this means?

20:42.328 --> 20:44.634
We just got to start
having more arguments.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.246
No, we don't.
That's crazy.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.464
You're crazy.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.423
Don't call me crazy.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.339
You're right,
I'm sorry.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.254
I'm sorry, too.
