have a word for it?

07:54.482 --> 07:56.282

- This is our case.

You can't work it without us.

07:57.485 --> 07:59.185
Get your weird,
hairless fingers off of it.

of her slam poetry.

- Would I like to?

08:08.462 --> 08:10.463
- I would hate to!
- Your loss.

08:10.464 --> 08:12.532
Well, we've already searched
the entire apartment.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.267
Yeah, well,
now we're gonna search it,

08:14.268 --> 08:17.069
and find things you all missed,
like this!

08:27.348 --> 08:29.682
Hollywood doesn't

08:29.683 --> 08:33.753
A parsec is actually
a measure of distance.

08:33.754 --> 08:36.255
One of the many inaccuracies
in the "Star Wars" universe.

08:36.289 --> 08:39.491
Uh-huh.
And what's "Star Wars"?

08:39.493 --> 08:40.727
Oh, boy.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.529
Maybe I'm getting ahead
of myself.

08:42.530 --> 08:45.031
Okay, let's talk planets.

08:45.032 --> 08:47.533
Jupiter is a gas giant.

would you tell Soren about it?

to the case.

is that we win the trophy.

athletic person you know?
