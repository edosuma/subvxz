00:00.010 --> 00:02.450
Congratulations! He's been charged.
That fella you tipped us off about.

00:02.500 --> 00:05.509
Have you not heard? Apparently
another body's turned up.

00:05.559 --> 00:07.750
I bet he'd love to see you.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.390
- I wondered about writing to him.
- You should.

00:11.439 --> 00:13.269
A couple of weeks ago,
that new Miss Wealand.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.190
Asking Ryan questions about
his dad. Have you met her?

00:16.239 --> 00:17.350
It's her.

00:17.399 --> 00:18.390
I've done things.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.710
Is it to do with those women?

00:19.760 --> 00:21.750
You'll visit me, won't you? In prison.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.140
I don't think you'd like prison.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:52.000 --> 00:53.429
Ah.

00:53.479 --> 00:57.549
Long story sideways. Our Ryan
has been coming home from school

00:57.600 --> 01:00.429
talking about Tommy Lee Royce
as this poor misunderstood fella

01:00.479 --> 01:02.549
that we all need to forgive.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.269
Someone in this school is
putting ideas into his head.

01:05.319 --> 01:08.189
Someone left a birthday present,
an expensive birthday present,

01:08.239 --> 01:11.030
on our doorstep with a card "from Dad".

01:11.079 --> 01:14.430
Now, he is starting to think of
that evil, twisted, murdering bastard

01:14.480 --> 01:17.750
as his father because some deluded tw...

01:17.799 --> 01:20.430
Someone in this school is filling his head

01:20.480 --> 01:22.819
with deeply inappropriate ideas.

01:25.599 --> 01:27.870
Do you recognise that person?

01:31.879 --> 01:34.189
- No.
- It's a woman, it ain't a lad.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.789
Our Clare thinks it looks
like Miss Wealand, your new TA.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.629
That's someone in the toyshop in
Hebden buying exactly the same toy

01:40.680 --> 01:43.469
that was left on our doorstep
two weeks ago "from Dad".

01:43.520 --> 01:45.430
Now, obviously she could
have been buying it

01:45.479 --> 01:46.950
for some completely other reason.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.710
But it's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

01:48.759 --> 01:51.469
Has Ryan said that it's her
that's been talking about his dad?

01:51.520 --> 01:54.629
No. It's delicate. I can't talk to
him about it. He gets angry with me.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.829
Look, this is how insidious
it is. I'm the baddie.

01:56.879 --> 01:58.990
Look. I'm not saying
you're wrong, Catherine.

01:59.039 --> 02:02.150
But Miss Wealand is a very
kind, caring, lovely woman,

02:02.200 --> 02:03.829
she came to us with an excellent CV.

02:03.879 --> 02:06.269
I'm sure she is, I'm sure
that's how she operates.

02:06.319 --> 02:09.110
Her and every other deluded nutcase
that's ever groomed a kiddie.

02:09.158 --> 02:10.469
- Groomed?
- Well, it's what it is.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.789
If every time they have a
one-to-one reading session,

02:12.840 --> 02:15.590
she's encouraging him to think
about his "dad" in some misguided,

02:15.639 --> 02:17.949
- sentimental way...
- Hang on, look, we don't know that

02:18.000 --> 02:20.310
that is what's happening.
Why would anybody do that?

02:20.360 --> 02:22.069
Cos people are weird.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.389
People are mad, and
they don't always have it

02:24.439 --> 02:26.189
tattooed across their forehead.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.229
The staff in this school are fully
aware of the situation with Ryan.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.629
Does she work part time?

02:31.680 --> 02:33.430
Yes, Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

02:33.479 --> 02:35.710
- What does she do on her days off?
- I've... I don't know.

02:35.759 --> 02:37.229
- Where does she live?
- Catherine.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.349
- Does she talk about her
private life? - Not to me.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.310
You see, when that present appeared
on our doorstep and I saw that

02:42.360 --> 02:43.870
card, my first thought is...

02:43.920 --> 02:45.710
"This is someone who
visits him in prison."

02:45.759 --> 02:47.590
I can't believe she
visits anyone in prison.

02:47.639 --> 02:49.349
This is someone he's manipulated and...

02:49.400 --> 02:51.670
Let me introduce you to her.
Come and meet her, please,

02:51.719 --> 02:52.829
come and see for yourself.

02:52.879 --> 02:55.750
Honestly, Catherine, I think
you'll be very pleasantly surprised.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.389
No, cos we'll know soon enough
if it's her, because the DIU are

02:58.439 --> 03:00.629
investigating everybody
he has any contact with.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.469
In the meantime, if you could
find someone else to read with him,

03:03.520 --> 03:05.949
I'd be very grateful, because
every second -- if it is her,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.550
and maybe it isn't, but if it is her --

03:08.599 --> 03:09.949
every second he spends with her,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.550
she is encouraging him to think
about this man as his father.

03:12.599 --> 03:16.189
This psychopath, this man who's done
nothing but destroy people's lives.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.750
This man who threw petrol
over him 18 months ago.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.629
Someone here, for whatever reason,
is encouraging him to think that

03:22.680 --> 03:27.069
he is basically an OK guy and
that I am some nasty, angry bitch

03:27.120 --> 03:29.909
for doing my damnedest to try
and protect him from him.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.099
OK.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.469
I can't talk to her, I can't get involved,

03:34.520 --> 03:37.229
I need to let the DIU deal with
it, but I need you to be aware.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.550
Right.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.470
I just want to make it clear

04:50.519 --> 04:53.149
to Alison that I am still
dealing with them scrotes,

04:53.199 --> 04:58.509
despite Daryl's sophisticated,
delicate efforts to take

04:58.560 --> 05:00.699
the law into his own hands.

05:11.279 --> 05:12.680
Sarge.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.509
Was it like that when you arrested him?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.790
I don't know.

05:19.839 --> 05:21.110
I can't remember.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.160
I've an idea it was parked
the other way round.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.509
Hello?

05:37.560 --> 05:39.159
Alison?

05:41.279 --> 05:42.680
Daryl?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.079
Hello?

06:09.360 --> 06:10.720
Alison?

06:12.680 --> 06:14.680
Alison, can you hear me?

06:20.759 --> 06:23.029
Alison, it's Catherine Cawood.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.709
Sergeant Cawood.

06:27.079 --> 06:28.589
Alison, listen, love, listen to me,

06:28.639 --> 06:30.629
I want you to squeeze my
hand if you can hear me.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.829
Check upstairs. See if
there's anyone else,

06:32.879 --> 06:35.220
anyone injured. And be careful.

06:42.759 --> 06:45.709
Bravo November 4-5. Urgent
assistance required.

06:45.759 --> 06:49.110
Far Sunderland Farm, up
Wainstalls, off Cold Edge Road.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.629
I need an ambulance, there's
a 40-something woman,

06:51.680 --> 06:53.670
Alison Garrs, suspected overdose.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.550
Diazepam, not sure how many,

06:55.600 --> 06:58.509
she seems to have washed them
down with vodka and whisky.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.230
Her pulse is weak, but she's
conscious and breathing.

07:01.279 --> 07:02.750
Alison?

07:02.800 --> 07:04.069
Alison.

07:05.399 --> 07:07.509
There's also a male.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.790
I'm fairly certain it's
her son, Daryl Garrs.

07:09.839 --> 07:12.149
Fatal gunshot injury
to the back of the head.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.629
Possible weapon at the scene.
I need F-Sup here to prove.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.790
I need the on-call DI, I need
the duty SIO, I need a CSI,

07:17.839 --> 07:21.079
I need any available troops
to come and secure the scene.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.560
God knows what's happened...

07:26.120 --> 07:27.350
.. but it's carnage.

07:27.399 --> 07:29.670
'I've got all that for the log, Sarge.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.670
'Is there anything else?'

07:31.720 --> 07:33.509
I'll keep you posted.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.029
Alison? Who's done this, Alison?

07:35.079 --> 07:37.709
Who's done this to Daryl, Alison?

07:37.759 --> 07:40.230
- No...
- Alison? Can you hear me?

07:42.120 --> 07:44.709
You put your arm round me, come on.

07:44.759 --> 07:46.829
- Upstairs is clear!
- Let's get her out of this.

07:46.879 --> 07:49.550
- I thought you weren't supposed
to move people. - Just...!

07:49.600 --> 07:52.720
- Where shall I get hold of her?
- Man up, princess, use your initiative!

07:57.560 --> 08:00.790
'Ambulance on its way to
you now, 4-5, from Keighley.

08:00.839 --> 08:02.389
'ETA 16 minutes.'

08:02.439 --> 08:03.550
Keighley?!

08:03.600 --> 08:06.000
'They're all tied up in Halifax.'

08:09.480 --> 08:11.750
Get your mobile out, dial 999.

08:12.639 --> 08:15.269
Alison! I need a paramedic talking to me,

08:15.319 --> 08:17.470
I need to know what the
latest is with an overdose.

08:17.519 --> 08:22.110
Hello, there, it's Constable Shafiq
Shah here, collar number 9242, I've
got a lady here, she's taken...

08:22.160 --> 08:24.470
- Diazepam, whisky, vodka.
- .. diazepam, whisky, vodka.

08:24.519 --> 08:26.670
We need advice, ambulance
is going to be 16 minutes.

08:26.720 --> 08:30.709
- Come on, don't fall asleep on
me, I need you awake. - Conscious,
but struggling to stay with us.

08:30.759 --> 08:34.549
Alison, listen. Alison, who shot Daryl?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.539
Who did that to Daryl?

08:37.120 --> 08:38.230
I don't know.

08:38.279 --> 08:40.269
Who was here? Did you see
what happened, Alison?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.710
Who was here?

08:41.759 --> 08:43.549
Nobody. Nobody was here.

08:43.600 --> 08:47.200
Right, you need to induce her
to vomit -- yeah, then what?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.029
Then you... Then clear the airway

08:49.080 --> 08:50.990
and put her in the recovery position.

08:51.039 --> 08:53.269
OK... Tell you what, you go back inside

08:53.320 --> 08:55.789
and get some water, and a blanket.

08:56.159 --> 08:59.509
And try not to-to tread on
anything... like the floor,

08:59.559 --> 09:01.070
any more than you have to.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.669
'The request's gone in to F-Sup, 4-5.
CID've been informed and they're on the way.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.149
'I've also put the request in for a CSI.
Is there anything else I can help you with?'

09:08.200 --> 09:10.190
What's the best way to make someone sick?

09:10.240 --> 09:13.519
- 'Stick your fingers down their throat?'
- Oh, yeah, and get my hand bitten off?

09:15.639 --> 09:18.159
OK, Alison. Listen to me.

09:22.679 --> 09:24.549
I need you to be sick.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.720
No, no, no, no.

09:27.879 --> 09:31.519
No. Alison. I know it's not pleasant.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.789
I just... want to... lie down.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.470
You can lie down, but I just
need you to be sick first.

09:39.519 --> 09:40.840
No.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.750
Can you stick your fingers
down your throat for me?

09:45.799 --> 09:46.940
No.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.470
I can't let you go to sleep
until you've been sick, Alison.

09:51.519 --> 09:54.460
You're not lying down
until you've been sick.

09:55.559 --> 09:56.950
Alison.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.960
- Sh. It's fine.
- No, stay awake, Alison!

10:03.039 --> 10:04.909
Right. Who shot Daryl? Alison.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.120
Alison?

10:08.320 --> 10:09.590
Alison.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.070
I shot Daryl.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.000
You? You shot...? You?

10:19.080 --> 10:23.200
You shot Daryl? You... You shot...

10:24.879 --> 10:28.379
Why, Alison, why would you
do... Why would you do that?

11:03.399 --> 11:07.470
Bravo November 4-5. Could you
contact Mr Shepherd or DI Shackleton

11:07.519 --> 11:09.830
at Norland Road and tell them

11:09.879 --> 11:13.750
there's a vehicle here that could
be involved in Operation Syracuse?

11:13.799 --> 11:15.399
A Peugeot 205.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.159
It's red.

11:19.399 --> 11:20.940
It's damaged.

11:21.919 --> 11:23.590
'Will do, 4-5.'

11:26.720 --> 11:29.149
Alison, did you really?

11:29.200 --> 11:30.470
Alison.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.000
I'm going to have to caution you.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.179
OK.

11:49.039 --> 11:50.840
I'm arresting you.

11:51.240 --> 11:56.080
Do you understand? I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

11:58.879 --> 12:01.220
You don't have to say anything.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.470
But it may harm your defence

12:03.519 --> 12:06.190
if you do not mention when questioned...

12:06.240 --> 12:08.840
something you later rely on in court.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.539
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.279
I don't feel so good.

12:41.039 --> 12:43.509
Steve. Can I borrow you for a bit?

12:45.159 --> 12:47.899
What's...? Has there been a development?

12:49.559 --> 12:54.110
A woman, up Wainstalls,
has just shot her own son

12:54.159 --> 12:55.789
in the back of the head.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.230
By accident?

12:57.279 --> 13:00.950
No. She's taken an overdose,
pissed out of her skull.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.230
And apparently,

13:02.279 --> 13:05.549
the reason she did it -- she's
just told Catherine Cawood --

13:05.600 --> 13:09.279
is because the son told her about
"what he did to those women".

13:12.120 --> 13:13.230
Is he dead?

13:13.279 --> 13:15.750
Well dead, by the sound of things.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.509
Jesus.

13:18.559 --> 13:20.080
I know.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.629
I need everyone in the briefing room.

13:23.679 --> 13:27.440
Apparently, he also said he "didn't
do that Vicky Fleming one".

13:29.279 --> 13:33.159
Can I get everyone in the briefing
room now, folks, please? Thank you.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.509
And he told his mother he wouldn't
have had to do that last one

13:38.559 --> 13:42.399
if people hadn't "kept thinking that
he'd done that Vicky Fleming one".

13:44.879 --> 13:48.429
We need to reassess everything
we've got on Vicky Fleming.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.230
We need to find this mysterious boyfriend
one of her colleagues at work mentioned.

13:52.279 --> 13:55.480
The one we thought Vicky
must have been making up.

14:32.759 --> 14:34.759
How's it going up there?

14:36.200 --> 14:38.669
Like Piccadilly Circus when I left.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.190
More detectives than primetime TV.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.759
I think they'll be there a while.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.909
Are you OK?

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
She shot her own child
in the back of the head.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.070
Are you still seeing that therapist?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.320
Yes!

15:07.840 --> 15:09.039
Yeah.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.710
I've got some intel for you. Tommy
Lee Royce's Scottish visitor

15:14.759 --> 15:16.990
is a woman called Frances Drummond.

15:17.039 --> 15:19.950
45 years old, she's a
pharmacist from Linlithgow.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.470
Well, she was until very recently.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.830
They've sent a photo.

15:24.879 --> 15:28.639
And I'm wondering if it's that woman
in that CCTV from the toyshop.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.990
So, if that's Frances Drummond...
who's "Miss Wealand", then?

15:34.039 --> 15:35.309
Well...

15:35.360 --> 15:38.100
she's invented Miss Wealand, hasn't she?

15:38.679 --> 15:40.669
Mrs Beresford told me this morning,

15:40.720 --> 15:43.320
"She came to us with an excellent CV."

15:44.840 --> 15:48.120
Mrs Beresford isn't somebody
who won't check out references.

15:52.639 --> 15:53.750
Shit.

15:53.799 --> 15:55.639
Shit.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.149
Hello?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.710
You're not going to believe
this, it's mental. She's mental.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.029
Who's mental?

16:02.080 --> 16:06.389
Well, not Miss Wealand, because
Miss Wealand, Cecily Wealand --

16:06.440 --> 16:09.840
a qualified teaching assistant
from Linlithgow -- is dead.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.230
'What?'

16:13.039 --> 16:16.309
Dead, and had her identity stolen.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.549
So who's...

16:17.600 --> 16:22.389
She is called Frances Drummond.
Also from Linlithgow. A pharmacist.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.830
God knows, don't ask.

16:23.879 --> 16:27.389
And she... visits Tommy
Lee Royce in Gravesend

16:27.440 --> 16:31.269
and now lives in Hebden,
as Cecily Wealand.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.350
Shit!

16:32.399 --> 16:33.909
- 'Oh, shit.'
- I know.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.429
No. I mean, do you want me
to get round to t'school?

16:37.480 --> 16:42.230
No. No, no, no, I'm just waiting
for some intel from East Lothian.

16:42.279 --> 16:44.629
They're talking to
Cecily Wealand's partner.

16:44.679 --> 16:46.309
Well, widower.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.309
I need a copy of the death certificate,

16:48.360 --> 16:50.509
and then CID'll go in
to arrest her for fraud.

16:50.559 --> 16:52.070
Wow. Fraud?

16:52.120 --> 16:54.149
'Yeah. Fraud by false representation.'

16:54.200 --> 16:56.389
We'll deal with whatever the
hell she thinks she's been

16:56.440 --> 16:58.710
doing regarding our Ryan
after we've dealt with that.

16:58.759 --> 17:00.509
Hang on, she's, she's, she's...

17:00.559 --> 17:01.990
'She's targeted him.'

17:02.039 --> 17:08.309
It's properly creepy, she's obtained
a job she's not qualified for,

17:08.358 --> 17:12.029
'she's stolen a dead woman's identity'

17:12.079 --> 17:14.750
specifically because this woman

17:14.799 --> 17:17.430
had the right kind of
qualifications to allow her to get

17:17.480 --> 17:21.549
close to Ryan so she could fill his
head with pap about Tommy Lee Royce.

17:21.598 --> 17:26.279
Who she, Frances Drummond,
visits in Gravesend.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.430
Phone, I've gotta go, bye, bye-bye.

17:39.240 --> 17:45.440
So... Cecily Wealand was
Frances Drummond's sister.

17:47.039 --> 17:50.309
48 years old, she had a
stroke nine months ago.

17:50.359 --> 17:52.480
Her partner...

17:54.920 --> 17:59.440
Her husband... thinks
when she died, Cecily...

18:01.720 --> 18:06.349
He was in pieces, and Frances helped
with a lot of practical stuff,

18:06.400 --> 18:09.910
and he thinks that's when she
might have got her hands on various

18:09.960 --> 18:12.299
bits of personal documentation.

18:14.279 --> 18:16.869
Right -- let's send 'em
in to make the arrest.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.109
Have you got a number
for this Mrs Beresford?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.910
I'll ring her and warn her they're coming.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.069
Then I'll get on to the
prison liaison officer.

18:23.119 --> 18:27.019
They need to let Gravesend know
he's been grooming this woman.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.829
Sad, isn't it? No criminal record.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.150
She's held down a
perfectly respectable job

18:34.200 --> 18:35.589
for upward of 15 years.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.279
And then...

18:38.279 --> 18:41.109
.. she does this mad thing.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.700
And for what?

18:43.640 --> 18:46.349
45 minutes once a fortnight
with a psychopath.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.269
- 'Hello.'
- Yes! Hello. It's Mike Taylor.

18:55.759 --> 18:59.190
I've got POLSA team
pulling the place apart.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.470
There's all sorts of stuff in his bedroom

19:01.519 --> 19:04.269
and chances are there'll be stuff
he's hidden as well. I think...

19:04.319 --> 19:07.430
Dare I say it, I'll be
surprised if this isn't him.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.750
Have you had time to think
through a media strategy?

19:09.799 --> 19:12.309
Yeah, the minute we're in a
position to break the news...

19:12.359 --> 19:15.109
- Did you fast-track that DNA swab
they took last week? - I did, yeah.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.789
'Good. Yeah, the minute we're
in a position to break the news,

19:17.839 --> 19:20.990
'I want images of Vicky Fleming out
there big time. On every news channel.

19:21.039 --> 19:22.750
'I want the date that flat was burnt out'

19:22.799 --> 19:24.190
seared into people's brains.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.150
I want people thinking back to that night,

19:26.200 --> 19:28.109
what they were doing that night.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.750
We just didn't get that message
out there big enough last time,

19:30.799 --> 19:32.069
somebody must have seen her.

19:32.119 --> 19:34.390
Somebody must have seen
or heard something.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.670
Yeah. Yep.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.839
Because if they didn't... God knows.

19:40.440 --> 19:44.069
You know -- whoever burnt
that flat out knew exactly what

19:44.119 --> 19:46.670
they were doing as regards
destroying evidence.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.829
'And whoever mutilated her body knew what
this lad was doing to these other women.'

19:50.880 --> 19:54.670
I'm looking at who's here...
all doing their jobs.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.630
And I'm thinking about everybody
there, everybody on the team,

19:57.680 --> 19:59.589
'my team, in the office.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.029
'Might not be a man! Which
one of 'em would do that?'

20:03.079 --> 20:05.029
Which one of 'em would be capable of it?

20:05.079 --> 20:08.069
Well, there are other explanations.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.559
Yes, but... Address the question.

20:11.720 --> 20:15.359
Well, your first instinct is
nobody. Nobody's capable of that.

20:16.720 --> 20:20.509
But then the truth is...
anybody's capable of anything.

20:20.559 --> 20:22.700
In the right circumstances.

20:23.319 --> 20:24.670
So, who, then?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.549
Oh... I've gone all creepy now!

20:26.599 --> 20:28.710
You're making me feel
like maybe I've done it.

20:28.759 --> 20:31.230
I know. It's that mad,
isn't it? So come on.

20:31.279 --> 20:33.509
'Who? Why would I do it?'

20:33.559 --> 20:35.670
- You?
- 'Let's start with me.'

20:35.720 --> 20:38.190
Under what circumstances
might I end up doing that?

20:38.240 --> 20:41.430
'I haven't, by the way.
Although I would say that.'

20:41.480 --> 20:45.430
Right, well. You'd do it...

20:45.480 --> 20:47.910
if you wanted to get rid
of somebody and disguise it.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.150
Somebody... who'd upset you, obviously.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.470
I mean...

20:52.519 --> 20:54.269
The way she was strangled, it was...

20:54.319 --> 20:56.150
Not like it was an accident, was it?

20:56.200 --> 20:59.480
Vicky Fleming had John Wadsworth's
number on her mobile phone.

21:01.119 --> 21:02.789
'He accounted for it.

21:02.839 --> 21:06.069
'He did an investigation at the
building society three years ago

21:06.119 --> 21:08.150
'when he was on the economic crime unit,

21:08.200 --> 21:10.710
'and it isn't even like
the number was ever used.'

21:10.759 --> 21:13.309
Well, there you go, that's
a perfectly reasonable...

21:13.359 --> 21:16.750
'But people use secret
shagging phones, don't they?

21:16.799 --> 21:19.349
'That they could destroy.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.829
'In a fire.'

21:20.880 --> 21:23.670
And the thing is, his marriage
has been a bit shit lately.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.720
Oh, well, better arrest
him, then, eh, boss(!)

21:27.079 --> 21:28.509
'I know.'

21:28.559 --> 21:30.029
I've known the man 23 years,

21:30.079 --> 21:33.079
you feel like washing
your mouth out, don't you?

21:36.640 --> 21:38.039
After you.

21:40.319 --> 21:42.309
These gentlemen need to talk to you.

21:42.359 --> 21:44.789
This is... Miss Wealand.

21:44.839 --> 21:46.670
Frances Elizabeth Drummond.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.079
Sorry?

21:49.119 --> 21:52.950
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of fraud by false representation,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.950
contrary to section two
of the Fraud Act 2006.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.829
You do not have to say anything.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.990
But it may harm your defence
if you do not mention

22:01.039 --> 22:04.309
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

22:04.359 --> 22:06.309
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.950
Do you have a mobile phone?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.309
Ryan Cawood needs to
talk about his father.

22:10.359 --> 22:12.470
He needs someone who will listen to him.

22:12.519 --> 22:14.710
You've been here under false pretences.

22:14.759 --> 22:16.029
Think about Ryan.

22:16.079 --> 22:19.430
I have to explain that to the parents and
to the governors and to the children.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.710
Think about Ryan.

22:20.759 --> 22:21.789
They liked you.

22:21.839 --> 22:23.390
Have you a mobile phone?

22:23.440 --> 22:25.109
In my handbag.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.630
And a coat?

22:28.160 --> 22:29.910
- Staffroom.
- Do you want me to...?

22:29.960 --> 22:31.630
Would you mind?

22:38.960 --> 22:40.630
So what'll happen?

22:40.680 --> 22:43.309
They'll charge her, then they'll bail her.

22:43.359 --> 22:44.960
And then what?

22:46.519 --> 22:47.990
And then...

22:49.960 --> 22:51.990
.. somebody might need
to pop round to her house

22:52.039 --> 22:54.869
on Upper Brunswick Street and
have a quiet word with her

22:54.920 --> 22:57.920
about taking the high
road back to Linlithgow.

22:58.799 --> 23:00.670
And will that be you?

23:02.240 --> 23:05.799
Well, you know me, I wouldn't want
her to break her bail conditions.

23:06.839 --> 23:09.990
She won't be allowed
within 500 yards of Ryan

23:10.039 --> 23:12.680
and/or members of his family, so...

23:23.319 --> 23:26.349
Eh, you'll not credit.
I looked in on Winnie.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.000
She's only gone and got Ilinka a job.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.710
- How?
- Cleaning at White Lion.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.029
How?

23:34.079 --> 23:36.269
Gordon popped round. Four doors down.

23:36.319 --> 23:40.910
And he knows Tanya -- I think it's
her uncle -- and she's manager.

23:40.960 --> 23:45.349
So, Ilinka went round there
with him and Bob's your uncle.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.269
I said, "Can you get me a job, Winnie?"

23:48.319 --> 23:49.990
So, what, is she stopping?

23:50.039 --> 23:51.750
I know, that's what I said.

23:51.799 --> 23:55.910
And Winnie goes, "Well, we've
got the alarm now, haven't we?

23:55.960 --> 23:58.910
"And I have asked Catherine...

23:58.960 --> 24:02.240
"to not bother sleeping in
that conservatory any more."

24:05.240 --> 24:07.039
Are you all right?

24:09.599 --> 24:12.539
Just an odd day. Wi'
that there this morning.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.190
Shot her own kid's head off.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.829
Your own kid.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.279
What does it take to do that, eh?

24:22.640 --> 24:23.750
I mean, obviously,

24:23.799 --> 24:26.349
it takes finding out you've
given birth to a serial nutter.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.309
But then, after she'd
explained that, she goes,

24:29.359 --> 24:31.630
"Only he didn't do that fourth
one, that Vicky Fleming.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.589
"He wanted people to know
that wasn't him." Like...

24:34.640 --> 24:38.079
"Oh, that's all right, then. As
long as he didn't do that one."

24:43.160 --> 24:45.900
God alone knows what she's been through.

24:47.279 --> 24:48.829
So who did?

24:48.880 --> 24:52.079
Well, that's the 64 million
question now, isn't it?

24:56.480 --> 24:58.680
I'll start cooking some tea.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.750
- Oh... - Frances, I'm not
here as a police officer,

25:53.799 --> 25:56.509
I'm here as Ryan's grandmother.
I want to sort this out.

25:56.559 --> 25:59.789
I want to understand you and
I want you to understand me.

25:59.839 --> 26:02.309
I know you've never had a criminal record.

26:02.359 --> 26:04.710
I know you've held down
a very responsible,

26:04.759 --> 26:07.430
perfectly respectable job
for the last 15 years.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.789
I want to understand why
you've done what you've done,

26:09.839 --> 26:12.109
I want to know what you want.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.349
And I want you to know things about me.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.589
- Can I come in?
- No...

26:18.640 --> 26:21.589
Or we can go down the road
and get a cup of tea somewhere

26:21.640 --> 26:23.799
if... if you'd prefer.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.150
Your people came here. They took things.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.990
You've had a long day. Probably
quite an unpleasant one.

26:54.039 --> 26:56.430
I won't take up any more
of your time than I need to.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.670
- OK. - What I think, you see,
is that you're not a bad person.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.630
Far from it.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.589
And you believe what you've
done, you've done for the best.

27:04.640 --> 27:07.950
Ryan should have a
relationship with his father.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.869
However difficult things are.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.750
Look, I realise everything
you know about...

27:12.799 --> 27:15.400
this, us, you've been told by... him.

27:17.279 --> 27:19.279
Tommy Lee Royce. And...

27:21.319 --> 27:23.460
Do you mind if I sit down?

27:24.720 --> 27:27.750
And I realise that you are in...
a relationship of some sort

27:27.799 --> 27:29.029
with him.

27:29.079 --> 27:31.019
We're getting married.

27:35.559 --> 27:37.670
OK, look. I know you're
probably not going to accept

27:37.720 --> 27:39.349
a lot of the things I tell you right now.

27:39.400 --> 27:44.069
But obviously, I have a very different perspective
on it all, to him, and I want you to hear it.

27:44.119 --> 27:46.519
Whether you accept it or not. OK?

27:46.960 --> 27:48.829
He's a sex offender.

27:49.359 --> 27:50.710
He raped my daughter.

27:50.759 --> 27:52.990
He was very fond of your daughter.

27:53.039 --> 27:56.069
No. No. He took advantage
of her. Brutally.

27:56.119 --> 28:00.269
Brutally. And after Ryan was
born, she took her own life.

28:00.319 --> 28:03.069
That was nothing to do with
him. He was in prison by then.

28:03.119 --> 28:05.589
It had everything to do with
him. She was traumatised.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.150
We are going to have different
versions of the same story,

28:09.200 --> 28:11.200
but please credit me...

28:12.240 --> 28:16.029
I was there when she gave birth.

28:16.079 --> 28:17.480
And after.

28:18.359 --> 28:20.190
And I know what she went through.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.470
You deprived him of having a
relationship with his child.

28:23.519 --> 28:26.029
You never even let him
know he'd been born.

28:26.079 --> 28:29.599
Tommy Lee Royce is a psychopath.

28:30.759 --> 28:34.039
He's a murderer and he's a sex offender.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.269
And you must know, you must realise that.

28:37.319 --> 28:41.349
I think you have allowed yourself
to be deluded by this dangerous man

28:41.400 --> 28:42.990
because you're infatuated with him.

28:43.039 --> 28:45.309
You might not want to believe
that he raped my daughter,

28:45.359 --> 28:48.390
but you do know -- you DO know
-- that he raped Ann Gallagher,

28:48.440 --> 28:50.910
and that he murdered Kirsten McAskill

28:50.960 --> 28:56.150
in the most HIDEOUS manner -- and
Lewis Whippey, and Brett McKendrick.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.630
And he tried to murder me.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.869
Lewis Whippey was the one
who raped Ann Gallagher.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.750
And he was the one who murdered
Kirsten McAskill. Not Tommy.

29:02.799 --> 29:05.630
That's not what the court decided
on very solid forensic evidence.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.750
Tommy did kill Lewis
Whippey and Brett McKendrick

29:08.799 --> 29:10.269
but only in self-defence.

29:10.319 --> 29:12.920
He attacked YOU only in self-defence.

29:14.240 --> 29:18.349
OK. So obviously that's his version,
and clearly that's what you're
choosing to believe right now.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.549
Which worries me, Frances,
because it makes you --

29:21.599 --> 29:23.150
a woman who all your life

29:23.200 --> 29:27.990
appears to have been law-abiding,
logical, kind, normal --

29:28.039 --> 29:30.349
it makes you seem a
little bit... unhinged.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.750
And certainly misguided

29:31.799 --> 29:33.750
if that's what you're prepared to believe.

29:33.799 --> 29:35.670
Do you want to know what I believe?

29:35.720 --> 29:38.190
I believe that no-one is born evil.

29:39.039 --> 29:42.390
He may have done things, I know
he's done things, and, yes,

29:42.440 --> 29:44.869
he will inevitably have put
his own slant on it all

29:44.920 --> 29:47.950
and made it seem not as bad
as it might really have been.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.470
But we all do that, we're all
human. But he isn't evil.

29:52.519 --> 29:56.589
He's a product of his childhood,
and he had an awful childhood.

29:56.640 --> 30:02.069
But he isn't intrinsically evil.
We condemn the sin, not the sinner.

30:02.119 --> 30:03.390
With help and kindness,

30:03.440 --> 30:07.750
I believe he will become the person
he was always capable of being.

30:07.799 --> 30:10.910
Good and kind and gentle and thoughtful.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.630
That's what I see

30:12.680 --> 30:15.619
when I visit him. When
I look into his eyes.

30:16.799 --> 30:20.150
I see no evil. Not a trace of it.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.869
Surely it would benefit him

30:21.920 --> 30:24.920
and Ryan if they could
have a good relationship.

30:26.079 --> 30:27.990
Frances, you're old
enough to be his mother.

30:28.039 --> 30:31.269
I think you are actually older
than his mother was when she died.

30:31.319 --> 30:34.269
Does that not... ring alarm bells?

30:34.319 --> 30:36.750
- Does it not worry you?
- Why should it?

30:36.799 --> 30:40.750
He's using you. He's used
you to get close to Ryan.

30:40.799 --> 30:43.589
He's groomed you. You've been groomed.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.549
You've been picked, you've been chosen,
for what he can get out of you.

30:46.599 --> 30:48.990
He could be very fond of
Ryan if you'd let him.

30:49.039 --> 30:50.910
Oh, no, no, Frances. You can't

30:50.960 --> 30:53.829
begin to imagine on how many
levels that will never happen.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.069
Why are you so angry? So negative?

30:56.119 --> 31:00.390
No, I'm not. It's you who's
deluded about this dangerous man

31:00.440 --> 31:01.630
because he's pretty.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.960
Oh... You're jealous.

31:05.279 --> 31:08.829
No. No, no, I'm shocked, I'm disappointed

31:08.880 --> 31:12.349
that a woman of your obvious
intelligence and ability

31:12.400 --> 31:14.670
can allow herself to be fooled by this...

31:14.720 --> 31:17.319
this... this...

31:20.880 --> 31:22.509
You know, tell me this.

31:22.559 --> 31:25.990
If he looked like, I don't know,
Ian Brady, or Peter Sutcliffe

31:26.039 --> 31:27.869
or Jimmy Savile.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.259
Or some other sad, twisted fuck.

31:31.519 --> 31:34.259
Would you believe a single word he said?

31:35.559 --> 31:37.829
But he doesn't look like them.

31:38.559 --> 31:41.630
On the inside he looks exactly like them.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.269
And one day, maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but soon

31:45.319 --> 31:48.470
the scales will fall away from
your eyes, because they always do.

31:48.519 --> 31:51.710
And you'll realise how
foolish he's made you look.

31:51.759 --> 31:54.549
And how much damage he's inflicted on you.

31:54.599 --> 31:59.240
A nice, kind, normal person who this
really shouldn't have happened to.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.910
TV: 'At 17 minutes past
four this afternoon,

32:07.960 --> 32:11.589
'the remains of the dead man

What've I done?

Eh, what've I done? Nothing!

33:29.559 --> 33:31.400
Why me?

33:33.720 --> 33:35.920
Why me, you bastard?!

33:37.680 --> 33:40.390
You bastard! You bastard!

33:40.440 --> 33:42.309
You fucking... BASTARD!

33:42.359 --> 33:46.549
You bastard! What've I done?
What have I done? Nothing!

33:46.599 --> 33:47.910
Fuck all!

33:47.960 --> 33:51.990
Nothing, why, why?! You bastard!

33:52.039 --> 33:53.710
What've I done?!

34:11.840 --> 34:13.349
Everything all right?

34:13.400 --> 34:15.000
Yeah. Just...

34:17.360 --> 34:19.829
Neil wanted to tell you something.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.789
I knew Vicky Fleming.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.429
- Morning.
- Morning.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.070
I was just nipping through to
talk to one of your lot, actually.

34:44.119 --> 34:47.030
I've got some information that might
be relevant about Vicky Fleming.

34:47.079 --> 34:49.190
I don't know if it helps
but it's interesting.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.268
- If you can pass it on
to Mr Shepherd. - Sure.

34:51.320 --> 34:57.719
It's a friend of me sister's,
this... um... bloke...

34:59.599 --> 35:01.670
Are you all right? You
look like you've got flu.

35:01.719 --> 35:03.710
Yeah. I think I'm starting with it. Go on.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.190
He's called Neil Ackroyd,
he lives down Hebden Bridge.

35:06.239 --> 35:09.309
He's happy to come in and
be interviewed, although...

35:09.360 --> 35:10.869
Well, it's sensitive.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.829
He knew Vicky Fleming. This is
about four or five years ago.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.590
He was having a fling
with her. He was married.

35:17.639 --> 35:22.349
And apparently she tried to blackmail
him, well, she did blackmail him.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.469
She must have drugged him
and taken photos of him.

35:24.519 --> 35:25.750
Compromising photos.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.630
And then threatened to e-mail
them to everyone he knew --

35:28.679 --> 35:30.550
all his family and friends
-- if he didn't pay up.

35:30.599 --> 35:35.429
She'd downloaded his contacts.
Anyway. He couldn't pay what she
was asking, and she ruined his life.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.800
He lost his family, lost his job,
his dignity. He became an alcoholic.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.869
That's his name and number,
if you want to pass it on.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.190
Cos whoever killed her could've
been someone she was blackmailing.

35:49.239 --> 35:50.639
Thank you.

35:52.719 --> 35:54.510
You want to get yourself home to bed.

35:54.559 --> 35:56.699
I know. Thank you. Thanks.

36:13.469 --> 36:14.469
Morning.

36:14.519 --> 36:16.760
Morning... ma'am.

36:21.119 --> 36:22.869
That John Wadsworth.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.789
He's not this detective you
told our Daniel about, is he?

36:25.840 --> 36:27.150
Why?

36:27.199 --> 36:29.989
No, I just... I think you
did well to avoid that one.

36:30.039 --> 36:31.190
Why?

36:31.239 --> 36:33.789
I just gave him some information
that I thought might be

36:33.840 --> 36:35.750
pertinent to the investigation

36:35.800 --> 36:38.710
about this fella Vicky Fleming
blackmailed, years ago.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.150
And he has this glazed look
in his eye. Like... durr.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.909
- What, and you think it's him?
- Who?

36:42.960 --> 36:44.550
The fella she blackmailed?

36:44.599 --> 36:47.630
No. No.

36:47.679 --> 36:49.480
But I'm thinking...

36:52.039 --> 36:56.550
.. whoever did it could be
someone else she's blackmailed.

36:56.599 --> 36:59.949
Whereas he's really not
interested, right over his head.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.269
You can do a lot better than that, love.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.519
I didn't fancy him, if
that's what you're thinking.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.139
Good morning, you lucky people!

37:51.880 --> 37:53.309
Morning.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.630
Can I help?

37:54.679 --> 37:58.750
Yeah. I hope so. I'd
like to speak to someone.

37:58.800 --> 38:02.469
I've got some information
that might be relevant

38:02.519 --> 38:06.480
regarding the... um... Victoria Fleming.

38:08.159 --> 38:11.750
Right, this morning. We've got
two people who've come forward.

38:11.800 --> 38:17.030
We've got a... Gary Sugden.

38:17.079 --> 38:19.949
Yeah. Who's the landlord of the
Wills O'Nats pub up Slaithwaite.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.800
And Gemma Tomkinson, who works
at the Travel Inn at Ainley Top.

38:25.599 --> 38:29.309
Both of them are saying they've seen a woman
who they believe might have been Vicky Fleming

38:29.360 --> 38:34.110
at their establishments, with a man. Both are
talking about a man smartly dressed, professional,

38:34.159 --> 38:37.550
shirt and tie, suit,
clean-shaven, white, late 40s,

38:37.599 --> 38:40.190
early 50s, at around the
time she went missing.

38:40.239 --> 38:43.869
She -- this Gemma -- describes
the man as not looking very well.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.670
So, interviewing those two
this morning takes priority.

38:46.719 --> 38:49.150
This Gemma also reckons they
might still have some CCTV,

38:49.199 --> 38:51.670
even though it's more than
28 days since it happened.

38:51.719 --> 38:54.519
She's checked her records, and this was...

38:55.320 --> 38:57.550
.. three days before
the flat was burnt out.

38:57.599 --> 39:00.190
Three days before Vicky Fleming
last turned up at work.

39:00.239 --> 39:02.550
We've also had a number
of calls from people who

39:02.599 --> 39:05.070
were in Ripponden that night,
these are all new people,

39:05.119 --> 39:07.920
people who did not come forward last time.

39:17.840 --> 39:23.230
Sorry, this is... probably mad. But
when we were doing house-to-house

39:23.280 --> 39:25.510
weeks ago, me and John Wadsworth --

39:25.559 --> 39:27.750
and I'm not just saying this
because he stood me up --

39:27.800 --> 39:30.309
he was never off his phone,
making furtive phone calls.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.989
And I remember saying to Shaf,
"He's having an affair."

39:33.039 --> 39:35.030
And then like... a couple of days later,

39:35.079 --> 39:36.349
a week after my mother died,

39:36.400 --> 39:39.070
he was asking me how he could
get his hands on £1,000.

39:39.119 --> 39:41.070
And he looked like shit.

39:41.119 --> 39:44.309
And I know everyone's busy
thinking outside the box,

39:44.360 --> 39:46.550
but the fact does remain that
it'd make a lot more sense

39:46.599 --> 39:49.070
if it was someone inside
the investigation.

39:49.119 --> 39:51.639
Like he was being blackmailed.

39:53.159 --> 39:56.989
Catherine. There's a fella. I've put
him in there -- Graham Tattersall.

39:57.039 --> 39:59.989
He says he's got some information
about Victoria Fleming,

40:00.039 --> 40:02.309
and he wants to see a
detective, but they're still all

40:02.360 --> 40:04.869
up in the briefing and he's
itching to get off to work.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.920
- Could you...?
- Sure.

40:09.159 --> 40:11.800
It might be relevant. I'll mention it.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.550
Mr Tattersall? I'm Sergeant Cawood.

40:19.599 --> 40:21.869
If you want to give me a
few brief details I can

40:21.920 --> 40:25.719
pass your information on to
CID, and somebody'll contact you.

40:26.079 --> 40:27.550
Er. OK.

40:27.599 --> 40:30.949
Well. The thing is...

40:31.000 --> 40:36.280
I've been having a... in
a... having a... in a...

40:38.960 --> 40:40.630
.. relationship.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.630
She's married. I'm married.

40:43.679 --> 40:47.510
But... And her husband was having
an affair with someone else. But...

40:47.559 --> 40:50.349
Anyway, he was away from home one night --

40:50.400 --> 40:53.230
on obs, he said. He's a police officer.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.230
And I was round at her house.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.920
Cos normally when he's on
obs, he's out all night. So...

41:00.159 --> 41:02.590
This particular night...

41:02.639 --> 41:05.349
he turned up, one in the morning.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.869
Yeah.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.710
Which was... exciting.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.869
But the point is, she rang me. Last night.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.989
Amanda, his wife, did. And
we checked our diaries.

41:17.039 --> 41:20.510
And it's the same night that
Victoria Fleming went missing.

41:20.559 --> 41:23.349
Well, the same night
her flat was burnt out.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.789
Sorry, you think this bloke might
have something to do with Vicky Fleming

41:26.840 --> 41:31.150
- because he caught you in bed with
his wife at one in the morning? - Yes.

41:31.199 --> 41:32.349
What's his name?

41:32.400 --> 41:34.070
John Wadsworth.

41:35.679 --> 41:38.909
Paul, can you interview
this Gemma Tomkinson?

41:38.960 --> 41:41.630
John, can you phone these people
back who've left messages?

41:41.679 --> 41:45.869
I'm just going to go to the chemist
and get something for this, this cold.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.070
Oh, yeah. You do look like shit warmed up.

41:48.119 --> 41:50.150
- I shan't be long.
- Go home.

41:50.199 --> 41:51.269
I'm fine.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.789
Alastair...

41:56.480 --> 41:59.230
He did this. After they'd
arrested that lad, that first one,

41:59.280 --> 42:02.110
that Saturday morning. He must have
thought he'd got away with it...

42:02.159 --> 42:04.110
He came round our house
and he knocked me about.

42:04.159 --> 42:07.949
And he was going, "Where is she, then? Where's
this woman I've been having this affair with?"

42:08.000 --> 42:09.739
I shan't be long.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.780
Obviously by then she was
dead, so he could say that.

42:17.440 --> 42:18.639
John?

42:21.760 --> 42:23.039
John!

42:27.840 --> 42:29.269
John.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.719
Watch out!

42:31.360 --> 42:32.829
John, wait.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.619
I just want to talk to you!

42:40.559 --> 42:41.909
John!

42:41.960 --> 42:43.150
I just want to talk to you.

42:43.199 --> 42:44.719
John!

42:48.880 --> 42:51.760
Fucking idiot! What you doing?

42:53.239 --> 42:54.510
Jesus!

42:57.079 --> 42:58.630
Bravo November 4-5.

42:58.679 --> 43:00.230
I'm chasing -- it's complicated --

43:00.280 --> 43:04.599
'but I'm chasing DS John Wadsworth,
who I believe has been involved
in the murder of Vicky Fleming.'

43:07.519 --> 43:09.550
Follow that BMW! Put your foot down.

43:09.599 --> 43:12.340
Units to Sowerby Bridge railway station.

43:16.079 --> 43:18.630
For once in your life, in the
right place at the right time,

43:18.679 --> 43:20.710
doesn't it feel good, eh?

43:20.760 --> 43:23.630
God knows what his plans
are, but this is a dead end.

43:23.679 --> 43:26.280
Oh, bollocks!

43:35.119 --> 43:36.260
Oh!

43:40.079 --> 43:41.880
Throw it broadside!

43:50.719 --> 43:52.119
Handbrake!

43:54.159 --> 43:55.559
B-R-A-K-E.

44:11.480 --> 44:14.150
He's heading straight for the tracks.

44:14.199 --> 44:16.599
4-5, do NOT follow!

44:19.159 --> 44:22.519
Bravo November 4-5, do not follow.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.480
Bollocks.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.510
You don't come near me!

45:07.559 --> 45:11.190
John, it's not that high,
you're not going to...

45:11.239 --> 45:13.550
You're just going to break
your legs and make a mess.

45:13.599 --> 45:14.829
- Piss off.
- Shit.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.920
'He's on the bridge opposite the nick,
he looks like he's going to jump.'

45:19.079 --> 45:20.280
Shit.

45:21.960 --> 45:24.949
Come on, we both know she
was blackmailing you!

45:25.000 --> 45:27.110
I burnt the evidence, didn't I?!

45:27.159 --> 45:29.389
There's other people's evidence.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.710
There's this Neil bloke I
told you about, for one.

45:31.760 --> 45:36.070
And there's... more than
likely there's others.

45:36.119 --> 45:37.989
She spiked my drink!

45:39.119 --> 45:42.389
Took photos of me looking stupid
and she was going to send them

45:42.440 --> 45:44.750
- to people! - I know. - Everybody!

45:44.800 --> 45:48.309
People I work with, my mother, my kids,

45:48.360 --> 45:50.550
people I don't even know that well!

45:50.599 --> 45:53.590
They're just people --
people you don't even like --

45:53.639 --> 45:56.510
they're just people you've
had on your phone for years!

45:56.559 --> 46:00.389
I know! I know. I know how she operated.

46:00.440 --> 46:04.070
Look, she ruined people's lives,
I tell you, this bloke I know...

46:04.119 --> 46:07.599
I asked her to just let me go and
she wouldn't, and I begged her!

46:10.159 --> 46:12.429
And I didn't mean to kill her.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.710
Well, I didn't go in there to kill her,

46:15.760 --> 46:17.239
it just...

46:20.920 --> 46:23.800
And so I did this ridiculous thing to her.

46:25.519 --> 46:26.860
Hideous.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.389
And God knows that's not me.

46:30.440 --> 46:33.110
That's not what I'm like. I'm
not... I'm not a monster,

46:33.159 --> 46:34.829
- I never have been.
- John...

46:34.880 --> 46:37.750
You come any closer,
I'll take you with me!

46:38.519 --> 46:40.829
You were blackmailed. It was provocation.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.909
That's mitigating circumstances.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.110
And it sounds to me like manslaughter.

46:46.159 --> 46:48.750
It's ten years -- less.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.710
And you and me both know you could be out.

46:50.760 --> 46:53.099
Yeah, but I'll never work again.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.869
- Have you got children?
- Oh!

46:55.920 --> 46:57.309
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.349
Shut up!

46:58.400 --> 47:00.280
Sorry, sorry.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.030
I've...

47:05.119 --> 47:09.190
I've-I've... I've not done
any negotiating courses.

47:09.239 --> 47:10.639
Have you?

47:12.440 --> 47:13.639
Yeah.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.829
Suicide intervention training.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.239
So... So...

47:20.960 --> 47:23.429
So what should I be saying to you?

47:25.960 --> 47:29.630
You should be telling me that you're here
to make sure I get out of this alive.

47:29.679 --> 47:33.230
Yeah, well, I am. I am here for that.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.750
You should use my name a lot.

47:34.800 --> 47:37.079
OK. John.

47:39.400 --> 47:45.869
You've got to be assertive.
Reassuring. Empathetic, and kind.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.670
And you've got to listen. You've
got to be a good listener.

47:48.719 --> 47:51.230
And you tell them that even though
they can't see a way forward,

47:51.280 --> 47:52.550
you can.

47:52.599 --> 47:55.989
And how in 24 hours' time,

47:56.039 --> 47:59.840
it'll all seem very different
to what it might look like now.

48:00.039 --> 48:01.909
But you see, it won't.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.960
This can only get worse.

48:05.559 --> 48:08.429
How many people have you talked
down over the years, John?

48:08.480 --> 48:10.469
- 17.
- Wow.

48:10.519 --> 48:12.949
And I never lost one. Not one.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.760
One lad jumped before I got
there, but... apart from him.

48:18.239 --> 48:20.230
So, what you going to do?

48:20.280 --> 48:23.150
Mess my record up before
I've even started?

48:25.480 --> 48:29.389
You take your time, I'll
just... I'll just stand here.

48:29.440 --> 48:33.829
OK? I'm not going anywhere.
All right? I'll just listen.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.429
Or I'll talk. Whichever you prefer.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.280
You tell me, John.

48:42.440 --> 48:44.110
I love my kids.

48:44.639 --> 48:45.840
Yeah.

48:53.480 --> 48:54.619
Oh!

49:01.679 --> 49:04.619
Really need ETA on that
ambulance, thank you.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.699
- You all right, Sarge?
- Yeah.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.820
There but for the grace of God.

49:54.480 --> 49:56.230
Really?

49:56.280 --> 49:58.230
He stuck a broken bottle inside her

49:58.280 --> 50:00.829
and then prayed to God someone
else'd get copped for it.

50:00.880 --> 50:02.750
That isn't what I said to him, by the way.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.000
I did try and talk him down.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.760
I'm pleased to hear it.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.880
You all right?

50:13.000 --> 50:17.099
I thought I'd got through to him.
I thought he was stepping down.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.630
Then he just went limp

50:18.679 --> 50:21.280
and this odd look came over his face.

50:26.599 --> 50:28.739
He said, "I loved my kids."

50:33.039 --> 50:34.780
What a shit week!

50:38.119 --> 50:39.389
Sorry.

50:42.079 --> 50:45.190
I've had some more information
through. From the DIU.

50:45.239 --> 50:48.239
About some of Tommy Lee
Royce's other visitors.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.670
Oh, yeah?

50:50.719 --> 50:52.590
Interesting reading.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.880
And I've had a message from the
prison liaison service as well.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.630
It's all right, son, sit down.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.190
It's bad news, I'm afraid.

51:10.239 --> 51:12.590
Pending an inquiry into some
of the people who visit you,

51:12.639 --> 51:15.710
it's been decided -- by the Wing
Supervisor, and others -- that

51:15.760 --> 51:18.190
your visits and phone calls
will be suspended for a while.

51:18.239 --> 51:19.789
As of now.

51:19.840 --> 51:21.469
Why?

51:21.519 --> 51:23.659
That's all I can tell you.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.070
Suspended? What?

51:29.880 --> 51:31.429
Everyone who visits me?

51:31.480 --> 51:33.429
- As I've explained.
- Phone calls?

51:33.480 --> 51:34.510
- Yeah.
- Why?

51:34.559 --> 51:37.630
- I've told you everything I can.
- Why? Why? Fucking why?

51:37.679 --> 51:40.019
Calm down. Don't do that, Tommy.

51:41.559 --> 51:43.300
Calm down, Tommy!

52:05.639 --> 52:07.070
Hello, Frances.

52:07.119 --> 52:08.860
What do you want?

52:11.440 --> 52:15.030
These are some of Tommy Lee
Royce's other visitors.

52:15.079 --> 52:17.550
That one -- Gina Flynn --

52:17.599 --> 52:20.550
she's a 45-year-old
accountant from Warwick.

52:20.599 --> 52:23.539
Turns out he's engaged
to her as well as you.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.309
And that one -- Justine Niewinski
-- she's from Essex. A student.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.800
Media and politics. She's 23.

52:33.119 --> 52:35.320
He's engaged to her as well.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.670
And that one -- Lena Dixon --

52:37.719 --> 52:40.309
fitness instructor from Leicestershire.

52:40.360 --> 52:42.230
Also engaged to him.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.110
You take care of yourself, OK?

53:02.039 --> 53:05.119
- Hiya, Sarge. - Do you want
to go get yourself a cup of tea?

53:13.360 --> 53:14.960
Hello, Alison.

53:25.679 --> 53:27.219
How are you?

53:40.679 --> 53:43.550
I can't begin to imagine
how you must feel.

53:44.159 --> 53:47.110
But I just wanted to tell you that...

53:47.159 --> 53:48.900
I had a daughter.

53:51.039 --> 53:52.559
That died.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.269
She was 18.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.469
And I know it's not the same,

53:58.519 --> 54:02.039
but it's all I've got to relate it to.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.559
And I just wanted to say...

54:08.760 --> 54:11.500
.. don't be short of someone to talk to.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.510
If you want to.

54:17.320 --> 54:19.190
You know where I am.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.579
That's my number.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.960
You can always ring me.

54:52.679 --> 54:55.019
There's your post, sweet cheeks.

56:05.199 --> 56:06.469
You OK?

56:09.559 --> 56:13.469
It was odd the other day, talking
to Alison in the hospital.

56:13.519 --> 56:14.719
Why?

56:15.880 --> 56:17.820
She told me her story.

56:19.679 --> 56:25.199
You know -- yet another
everyday story of country folk.

56:29.519 --> 56:30.860
Her dad.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.960
He interfered with her.

56:37.079 --> 56:39.619
Daryl was his son, not his grandson.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.670
Jesus.

56:43.639 --> 56:46.579
She brought up this
kid, this child, this...

56:49.840 --> 56:51.440
.. aberration.

56:52.760 --> 56:56.630
That she loved and hated because...

56:56.679 --> 56:58.679
what else could she do?

57:01.760 --> 57:04.389
And she was terrified of
him finding out, so...

57:04.440 --> 57:08.309
she tried to stop him
bothering with the local lads.

57:08.360 --> 57:11.230
So they picked on him.
And they knew anyway.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.550
They knew something, somehow.

57:14.719 --> 57:19.079
So they became like outcasts, pariahs.

57:21.599 --> 57:23.670
Something to poke fun at.

57:27.039 --> 57:29.179
I said, "Did he ever know?"

57:31.960 --> 57:34.900
And she said she thought
he'd worked it out.

57:35.599 --> 57:38.139
Although they never talked about it.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.940
She said, "Because I
never had the language."

57:48.039 --> 57:49.920
And I thought, "Yeah.

57:52.639 --> 57:54.199
"I know."

58:05.800 --> 58:07.989
- Can I get a dog?
- No.

58:08.039 --> 58:09.550
Why?

58:09.599 --> 58:11.429
Because you won't look after it.

58:11.480 --> 58:12.869
No, I would.

58:12.920 --> 58:15.269
I'll walk it and feed it and everything.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.429
Yeah, for t'first week.

58:17.480 --> 58:20.150
So I was thinking maybe a Rottweiler.

58:20.199 --> 58:22.070
Oh, are you?

58:22.119 --> 58:23.630
An Alsatian, then.

58:23.679 --> 58:25.469
- An orang-utan.
- Oh, perfect.

58:25.519 --> 58:28.039
- OK, a Doberman.
- Yeah, right.

58:29.239 --> 58:30.909
- A Great Dane?
- No.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.070
A Siberian Husky. A St Bernard!

58:33.119 --> 58:34.429
Ha!

58:34.480 --> 58:36.349
Is that a yes?

58:36.400 --> 58:39.429
- Why can't you get something smaller?
- Like a pit bull?

58:39.480 --> 58:40.829
