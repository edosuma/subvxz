01:57.868 --> 02:01.371
<i>The deal between UBA
and Hyperion founder Paul Marks</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:03.999
<i>moved one step closer to completion
this week,</i>

02:03.999 --> 02:06.919
<i>with UBA's board of directors
formally recommending</i>

02:06.919 --> 02:11.340
<i>that shareholders vote on the sale at
the company's annual meeting next month.</i>

02:11.924 --> 02:15.636
<i>Critics are calling the deal reckless,
even dangerous.</i>

02:15.636 --> 02:19.556
<i>And as a former employee of UBA,
I have to agree.</i>

02:20.599 --> 02:23.894
<i>Should a billionaire
with an outsized aversion to the press</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:26.522
<i>be handed the keys
to a legacy media company</i>

02:26.522 --> 02:30.108
<i>at a time when truth matters
more than ever?</i>

02:33.070 --> 02:34.112
Everybody's jealous.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.824
So, there's been a lot of noise
about this deal.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.952
Big tech shouldn't be involved in media.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.747
Guys like me have too much influence,
too big a platform.

02:43.747 --> 02:44.665
We've heard it.

02:45.374 --> 02:48.085
Honestly, I'm probably the last person
that should be standing up here

02:48.085 --> 02:50.379
because I'm probably
the only person in this entire room

02:50.379 --> 02:51.755
that doesn't have a high school diploma.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.424
But, I want to be clear.

02:54.424 --> 02:58.136
I know what you guys do is essential,
and I'm here to support that.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.556
So, to that end,

03:00.556 --> 03:05.352
I am here to listen, be available,
and hopefully to start the conversation.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.730
So, if anybody has any questions,
fire away.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.651
Yeah. What's your take on the hack?
And do we know who's behind it?

03:12.651 --> 03:15.821
The operating theory right now is Russia.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.866
But I'm happy to have my forensics team
drill down into that

03:18.866 --> 03:20.492
and hopefully get to the bottom of it.

03:20.492 --> 03:25.163
Rest assured that from here on out,
your data will be secure.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.375
That kind of thing does not happen
at Hyperion.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.086
What about the people who work here
at <i>The Morning Show</i>?

03:31.670 --> 03:34.882
In this kind of a situation,
a lot of times people are laid off.

03:34.882 --> 03:40.220
Right. Well, my intention is to expand
the news division, not to gut it.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.973
It's probably a little too early
to get into the specifics of that.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.476
But once the ink is dry, we will review
the numbers.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.524
Yes, Alex. You don't have to
raise your hand.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.987
Hyperion is a multinational corporation,

03:56.987 --> 04:00.657
and you have close relationships
with governments, oligarchs--

04:00.657 --> 04:03.035
I'm not sure
I would characterize it that way, but...

04:03.035 --> 04:06.288
Well, how can we be sure
that news stories about Hyperion,

04:06.288 --> 04:08.999
or its associates, won't be spiked?

04:09.625 --> 04:10.792
Such as?

04:10.792 --> 04:14.796
Well, your company has contracts
with a number of law enforcement agencies.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.507
Alex, this is not a press conference.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.968
- We'll save that for after the deal.
- We're just asking questions.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.762
- It's okay.
- Just asking.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.180
Yeah. What? Was there a question?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.390
There are concerns that a police force
in Arizona

04:25.390 --> 04:30.312
was using your security software
to racially profile certain people.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.899
Norma Rae is coming in
a little hot this morning.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.653
Well, right. Well, I'm not exactly sure
how to respond to a rumor.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.739
I'm just saying it's a possibility
that there's a conflict of interest here.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.325
You know, on a number of issues.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.369
- Yeah.
- I've stated it before.

04:45.369 --> 04:49.581
I have absolutely no desire to determine
what is and what isn't newsworthy.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.751
That is Stella Bak's job,
and she is more than capable of doing it.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.753
Does that answer your question?

04:54.753 --> 04:55.879
Not entirely.

04:57.923 --> 05:02.135
Okay.
Well, why don't we sidebar that for later?

05:03.262 --> 05:05.180
Oh, God. Are you kidding me?

05:05.931 --> 05:10.894
Alex, if you could avoid accusing
our new partner

05:10.894 --> 05:14.064
of racially profiling the good people
of Arizona, that would be swell.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.609
We don't know what this guy does
or who he does it with.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.903
I personally just think
it's a reasonable thing to ask.

05:19.903 --> 05:24.241
Legal will be happy to walk you through
Paul's extensive business interests.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.285
But whatever personal thing you two have--

05:26.285 --> 05:28.829
I'm sorry. Personal?

05:30.247 --> 05:33.584
I saw your <i>Miss Saigon</i> helicopter arrival.
We all did.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.461
You mean when I single-handedly
brought him back to the table

05:36.461 --> 05:37.588
and saved your little deal?

05:37.588 --> 05:39.965
A deal you blew up in the first place?
No, no.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.843
You can't set a fire and then expect
a cookie when you put it out.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.761
Okay, I get it. All right? I get it.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.222
I pushed him out of the boat.
Brought him back into the boat.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.849
And it might've all been a little hasty.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.186
But now we have him back.
So we have to just do our due diligence.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.648
I want him on my show.
I wanna interview him.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.362
We're close to
the finish line on a negotiation

06:02.362 --> 06:05.532
- that has taken two fucking years...
- Two years.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.410
...and every Ivy League lawyer
from DC to Westchester,

06:08.410 --> 06:11.163
so can we skip you steering
that little boat of yours

06:11.163 --> 06:12.623
right onto the fucking rocks?

06:12.623 --> 06:17.252
Okay, Cory. I want this deal to go through
just as bad as you do.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.546
But there are a lot of skeptics out there.

06:19.546 --> 06:23.217
- I get it. No, I see.
- Great.

06:23.217 --> 06:26.595
You really do. You wanna be a partner.
You want that seat at the grown-up table.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.264
- But it's not your turn, Alex.
- Wow.

06:29.264 --> 06:34.102
I need you to cease and desist.
It's over. We vetted him.

06:34.686 --> 06:35.687
I haven't.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.481
Knock, knock.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.566
Is this a bad time?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.736
- Not at all. Please, come in.
- Yeah, I was just leaving. So...

06:42.736 --> 06:44.863
- Okay, thanks, Cory.
- Thank you, Alex.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.408
Good to see you again, Alex.

06:48.992 --> 06:49.993
Nice to see you.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.578
Okay.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.081
What was that all about?

06:54.081 --> 06:57.668
Well, welcome to the wonderful world
of talent management.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.633
Hi.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.969
- Hey. Hi. Sorry, we're early.
- Hey.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.179
- First time for you.
- Okay.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.474
- You must be Cheryl. Hi, hi.
- Sorry.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.434
- It's so great to finally meet you.
- Okay.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.271
- It's nice to meet you too.
- You're even prettier in person.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.522
Thank you.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.400
- And this must be Taylor.
- Yeah.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.485
- Taylor, hi. H-- Okay.
- Why don't you say hi?

07:24.319 --> 07:27.406
Hi. It's okay. Yeah?

07:27.406 --> 07:30.158
- Hi, I'm your auntie Bradley.
- Yeah.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.412
- Look at her.
- She kinda has Mom's face a little bit.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.497
- That freaks me out a little.
- Oh, yeah.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.584
- I mean... Dada.
- I'm a dad.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.877
- That's me. I did it.
- Wow.

07:39.877 --> 07:42.379
- Okay. Come on in, you guys.
- Thank you.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.589
Make yourselves at home.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.424
Wow.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.926
Cheryl, I don't know how to deal with

07:47.926 --> 07:49.469
- that pack-and-play thing.
- No, no.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.763
- Don't worry. They're impossible.
- Yeah.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.226
- That's how you do that.
- That's how you do that.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.645
I can't wait to see you do the news.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.522
Oh, right.

08:00.522 --> 08:04.026
Hey. I don't know if we're gonna have time
with the size of your to-do list, babe.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.235
Oh, really?

08:05.235 --> 08:07.279
- Maybe next time. Right, Brad?
- Yeah.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.739
But your bedroom's straight ahead...

08:08.739 --> 08:09.948
- Thank you.
- ...and I'll be right there.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.744
- Hey, Brad. Are you, like, a prepper now?
- I'm not gonna let you starve on my watch.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.413
All right,
I am gonna go help your lovely wife.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.708
I'm gonna send you some stuff
from your mom's house.

08:19.708 --> 08:24.546
- Her Hummels would look perfect in here.
- I don't really-- Hummels?

08:24.546 --> 08:27.799
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.051
- Great to meet you.
- Indeed.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.761
- We'll see the next time.
- Yep.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.554
- Glen.
- Love that guy.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.933
- Stella Bak. There she is.
- What's up?

08:36.933 --> 08:39.269
- You're running late?
- Sorry. Yeah.

08:39.269 --> 08:44.566
Sports wants to build out programming
based on my Formula One team.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.401
- They had a lot of ideas.
- Yeah.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.362
They've been banned from staff retreats.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.200
Look at you running a major news division.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.911
Look at you, buying a major media company.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.247
I always knew
you'd end up at a place like this.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.167
I remember you telling me
that I wasn't cut out for tech.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.754
And you ignored me,
and you built your own start-up.

09:05.754 --> 09:06.964
Yeah.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.465
I've been keeping my eye on you.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.425
You're one of the reasons
I'm interested in this place.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.347
So, UBA News. What's on your wish list?

09:15.347 --> 09:16.598
Cutting right to it.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.685
- Well, I am running late.
- Yeah.

09:20.602 --> 09:23.230
I want more political coverage,
starting with midterms.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.359
Even Gen Z are watching network TV
when democracy is a cliff-hanger.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.277
Okay.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.696
And we're missing huge market shares
in digital.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.906
UBA could piggyback on your search engine

09:32.906 --> 09:36.660
and create a hybrid site with curated
headlines based on search histories.

09:36.660 --> 09:41.039
So you need resources to go
on the offensive using my technology.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.960
Why are you here?

09:46.670 --> 09:50.132
And don't tell me
it's to save the fourth estate.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.222
This place has been treading water
since Cory took over. Don't you think?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.891
We've had our share of challenges.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.185
Why are you covering for him?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.647
Paul. It's time.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.318
- It's time. Okay.
- Amanda.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.444
Stella.

10:10.444 --> 10:14.156
Great seeing you. We'll talk again.
Let's get a drink.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.203
What is next?

10:33.383 --> 10:34.635
This view!

10:36.678 --> 10:39.014
Wow.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.850
They don't call it the "Summit"
for nothing.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.314
The Empire State Building looks gorgeous.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.484
All I can think of is
<i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.028
Yeah. Which I have now seen,
like, 20 times.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.948
- Really? I've never seen it. Is it good?
- Yeah.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.074
- You would love it.
- Yes.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.367
- You would absolute--
- Really?

10:58.367 --> 10:59.535
No, you would not love it.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.956
Uh-oh.

11:05.541 --> 11:08.585
- It's all the excitement.
- I think she's hungry, babe.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.796
Just give us a minute.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.094
It's okay, baby. Mama's got you.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.680
- I love her.
- Yeah?

11:19.680 --> 11:22.224
Oh, my gosh. Yes, she's amazing.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.393
Don't mess it up.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.732
Yeah. I'll try not to mess it up.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.779
Hey, I didn't mean it like that.
I'm proud of you.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.447
Hey, can I tell you something?

11:38.115 --> 11:38.991
Yeah.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.995
I'm turning myself in
for what I done at the Capitol.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.539
What?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.000
Two days from now,

11:48.584 --> 11:50.711
I'm gonna send Cheryl and the baby home,

11:50.711 --> 11:52.629
and I'm going into the FBI field office.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.423
She doesn't know anything about it yet,

11:54.423 --> 11:57.092
so I'd appreciate it
if you didn't say anything.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.847
Oh, my God, Hal.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.812
You don't need me to tell you
how stupid that is, do you?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.774
They are going to find me.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.194
Are you cra--
They're going through the footage.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.487
- They're pulling in everybody.
- Oh, my God.

12:17.988 --> 12:21.533
But they go easier on you
if you turn yourself in.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.160
Oh, my God.

12:23.160 --> 12:27.623
I do not need the FBI kicking my door in,
pointing a gun--

12:27.623 --> 12:29.750
No, Hal. Just no.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.962
Brad, I'll keep you out of it.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.173
How are you gonna keep me out of it?

12:37.132 --> 12:39.718
Five minutes after you confess to the FBI,

12:39.718 --> 12:42.971
they are gonna charge me
with destroying evidence

12:42.971 --> 12:45.224
and making a false statement.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.226
Both of those are felonies, Hal.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.269
No, I'm sorry. You can't do that.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.774
We have to put this behind us.
This is already behind us.

12:54.358 --> 12:57.778
I have already made up my mind.
I am doing this.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.948
I just wanna let you know.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.675
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.886
You summoned me. Is this our sidebar?

13:22.886 --> 13:25.973
Yes, it is. Come on in. Have a seat.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.641
What can I do for you?

13:28.559 --> 13:31.645
Well, I have a request.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.814
You wanna meet my favorite oligarch?

13:35.357 --> 13:38.485
No. Well, I would--
I'd like to interview you.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.571
I'd love you on my show.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.991
I know. I know you don't do interviews.
I know.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.160
- But people are skeptical.
- Yeah, so you say.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.039
And I think it's a legitimate concern
for the shareholders.

13:51.039 --> 13:55.961
And this would be a beautiful opportunity
for you to tuck them in and show them

13:55.961 --> 13:58.297
- why they should support this deal.
- Yes.

13:58.297 --> 14:01.133
I also think it would be
a great opportunity for you.

14:01.133 --> 14:05.220
I said yes. Happy to do that.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.639
- Yes.
- So...

14:09.558 --> 14:11.101
No questions in advance.
That kind of thing?

14:11.101 --> 14:12.686
That's how your show works, right?

14:14.980 --> 14:16.106
Yes.

14:16.106 --> 14:19.234
And I assume
you don't have a problem with that.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.861
Okay. How's Thursday?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.530
Thursday. This Thur--

14:23.530 --> 14:25.365
- This Thursday, Thursday?
- Yeah.

14:25.365 --> 14:29.077
I have to be in Texas next week.
So, sorry.

14:29.077 --> 14:34.499
No. Yes, Thursday. That's great.
Thursday it is. Perfect.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.667
Where?

14:37.836 --> 14:39.755
Do you have a residence in this time zone?

14:41.089 --> 14:42.758
We can certainly use my place
in the Hamptons.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.093
- I can have Amanda set that up.
- Great.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.888
Did you think I was gonna say no?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.557
Yes. Kinda. I d--

14:51.475 --> 14:53.936
Well, I think you're right.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.812
I don't want there to be
any misunderstandings

14:55.812 --> 14:57.814
about what's going on here...

14:58.857 --> 15:00.859
- Yeah.
- ...with the deal.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.945
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.324
Right. So there. That's it. Great.

15:07.324 --> 15:11.745
I mean, Thursday it is,
in the Hamptons. So nice. All right.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.039
- I'm really looking forward to it.
- Me too.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.457
Great. Okay.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.419
- You know, this is your dressing room.
- Oh, fuck.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.755
Shouldn't I be the one to go?

15:24.758 --> 15:26.927
I say we splurge. It's our anniversary.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.387
What? It's not until June.

15:28.387 --> 15:31.223
No, it's not. It is April 30th.
Don't you remember?

15:31.974 --> 15:34.685
When we secretly held hands in the park
while we were covering the mobile morgue?

15:34.685 --> 15:37.062
- So romantic.
- That's when you're counting from?

15:37.062 --> 15:40.190
- Well, when do you count it?
- Our first kiss. Like a normal person.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.359
Come on. Niagara honeymoon package.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.779
Bottle of champagne. Cascading waterfall.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.948
Honeymoon package?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.659
I mean,
that's just what they call it, but...

15:52.244 --> 15:53.078
Okay.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.330
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.542
Hey, so-- Very subtle.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.752
I need background on Paul Marks.
I'm interviewing him.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.005
Wait, what?
I thought that guy had a camera allergy.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.423
Well, he just got over it.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.717
Okay. And Cory signed off on this?

16:06.717 --> 16:09.469
I don't need Cory's permission
to interview him, all right?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.054
I want the world to know
we're an open book

16:11.054 --> 16:12.139
and we have nothing to hide.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.601
Okay? It's happening.
It's happening. And in two days.

16:15.601 --> 16:16.935
- What?
- What?

16:16.935 --> 16:18.187
- What?
- No.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.231
No. You see,
I can't prep an interview in two days,

16:21.231 --> 16:22.399
especially for someone like him.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.817
That's not possible.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.236
Well, you're just gonna have to
put your social life on hold.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.073
Wait a second.
You are each other's social life.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.158
This will be fun.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.243
You're just gonna get to cuddle,
read press clippings.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.370
- You love that joke so much. Yeah.
- I do.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.706
Listen, I have
the whole research department on it.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.042
It's gonna happen, and we can do it.
You can do it.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.671
All right, fuck it. Let's do it.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.881
Okay. You put out feelers,

16:45.881 --> 16:48.634
find out anyone who's related to him
or has slept with him. God willing, both.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.427
- Maybe somebody goes on the record.
- Yep. I'll get into it.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.512
Okay. Great.

16:51.512 --> 16:54.848
You know, he has bought or built dozens
of companies in the past 20 years.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.559
There's gotta be somebody who knows
something, right? Or hates his guts.

16:57.559 --> 17:02.105
Okay. Okay, here we go.
We're gonna do this.

17:04.900 --> 17:05.733
You got a sec?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.236
- Yeah. Come in.
- Great.

17:08.945 --> 17:09.946
You...

17:10.821 --> 17:13.407
crossed paths
with Paul Marks in Silicon Valley, right?

17:14.242 --> 17:15.743
Briefly. Why?

17:16.494 --> 17:17.621
What was he like back then?

17:18.413 --> 17:20.749
I don't know. Same as now.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.460
- Charming. Tall.
- Right.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.839
You ever, like, hear any shit
about him or anything?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.592
What do you mean exactly?

17:30.592 --> 17:33.887
You know, "shit."
Like a hit-and-run, dead strippers,

17:33.887 --> 17:35.639
blood transfusions from a 12-year-old boy.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.057
That kind of thing, you know.

17:37.558 --> 17:41.478
Honestly, I barely knew him.
I was still in school.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.064
So...

17:45.440 --> 17:48.151
Right, okay. I just figured-- Maybe.

17:50.571 --> 17:51.572
Why do you wanna know?

17:52.072 --> 17:57.202
Well, he and Alex are going to sit down
and talk on the record.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.374
So, obviously, if you think of anything...

18:03.083 --> 18:04.084
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.377
Okay. Thanks.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.891
I wanna hit all five boroughs.

18:18.891 --> 18:23.103
And there's a ferry to Staten Island
that takes you right past Lady Liberty.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.480
- How much is that?
- It's actually free.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.274
Really? It's free?

18:27.274 --> 18:29.318
Definitely adding that to the list.

18:29.318 --> 18:32.696
And don't forget, babe, we have to hit
FAO Schwarz for the munchkin.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.157
What do you guys think
about swinging by UBA?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.284
Wow. Could we?

18:37.284 --> 18:39.453
Yeah,
I'll give you the whole VIP experience.

18:39.453 --> 18:42.289
You can watch me pre-tape a segment
for the <i>Evening News</i>.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.791
Yes, please. Yes.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.502
It's my pleasure. It'll be fun.

18:46.502 --> 18:51.215
Thank you. This is so exciting.
I can't wait to tell everyone back home.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.759
Hal, this is great.
I don't know what to wear.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.228
I think you look incredible
sitting up there.

19:04.228 --> 19:05.812
- Thank you.
- Don't you think, babe?

19:05.812 --> 19:08.232
- Yeah.
- Yes, I know you've been here before.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.692
Yeah, it was a while ago.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.986
Hal, good to see you again.
And you must be Cheryl.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.864
Yes.
Thank you so much for the VIP treatment.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.992
Well, it's not as flashy as
<i>The Morning Show</i>, but we do all right.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.994
Bradley,
this guy's having some tech issues,

19:20.994 --> 19:22.162
so the signal might drop.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.248
Yeah, no worries.
Thank you for organizing it.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.832
I know it was a bit of a scramble.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.670
I still think we should hold this one
until the hearings start in June.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.046
We can discuss later.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.881
Is this gonna be on the news tonight?

19:35.509 --> 19:36.552
It will indeed.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.555
- Do you guys wanna step back here?
- All right.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.808
- We're good to go?
- Counting you in now.

19:42.808 --> 19:46.520
- Thank you.
- In five, four, three...

19:48.897 --> 19:51.483
Ryder Flynt,
thank you so much for joining us.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.361
You are currently awaiting trial

19:54.361 --> 19:58.073
for assaulting a Capitol police officer
on January 6th.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.199
Is that correct?

19:59.199 --> 20:01.702
<i>I didn't think he
or anyone else had the right</i>

20:01.702 --> 20:03.203
<i>to keep us out of the Capitol.</i>

20:03.704 --> 20:06.498
<i>It's the people's house.
The people were screwed.</i>

20:06.498 --> 20:08.458
<i>So, the people, they needed to respond.</i>

20:08.458 --> 20:11.920
Did you believe
the 2020 election had been stolen?

20:12.963 --> 20:14.047
<i>Hundred percent.</i>

20:15.007 --> 20:19.011
And after everything you've learned since,
do you still believe that?

20:22.264 --> 20:23.724
<i>No. No.</i>

20:25.726 --> 20:29.938
If you had known then that the
former president's claims were baseless--

20:29.938 --> 20:31.607
<i>I would've stayed the hell home.</i>

20:34.443 --> 20:35.527
<i>I--</i>

20:38.197 --> 20:39.364
<i>I lost my job.</i>

20:42.201 --> 20:45.370
<i>My family, they won't talk to me.</i>

20:47.956 --> 20:50.334
I wanna just pause right there. I--

20:50.834 --> 20:54.546
The loss of your family,
do you feel like it was worth it?

20:55.380 --> 20:56.632
<i>What the hell do you think?</i>

20:58.175 --> 21:02.679
I think we don't pay enough attention
to the collateral damage of all of this.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.060
Take your time.

21:15.484 --> 21:17.653
So, I was thinking
that <i>TMS</i> could cross-promote

21:17.653 --> 21:19.029
- Alex's interview with Paul.
- Yes.

21:19.029 --> 21:21.240
Drive up our numbers, help UBA+.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.825
I love it. I'll get a shit ton of B-roll
while we're at the house.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.702
Great. So, if you get us footage
from that interview,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.496
we can cut together a sneak peek.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.456
Capitalize on all the noise out there
about the deal.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.541
Perfect. Yep.

21:30.541 --> 21:31.750
Stella, what do you think?

21:31.750 --> 21:34.545
It's your show. Just do what you want.

21:38.549 --> 21:41.635
I'm just saying,
we have to walk a fine line.

21:41.635 --> 21:44.263
It can't look like an ad,
like we're rolling over for him.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.056
Come on. You know that's not Alex's brand.

21:46.056 --> 21:49.852
How's prep?
Did you find anything interesting?

21:51.061 --> 21:53.313
No. There's not a lot of lead time
on this one.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.816
So, nothing?

21:55.816 --> 21:58.694
Let's just say I'd have a better chance
of digging up Jimmy Hoffa

21:58.694 --> 22:00.112
than finding this guy's yearbook photo.

22:00.112 --> 22:03.824
Yeah, but does it matter? I mean,
we want this to be a victory lap, right?

22:07.619 --> 22:09.663
- Well, I think we're good here.
- Yeah. We are.

22:09.663 --> 22:11.206
Okay. All right.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.003
So, were you guys...

22:38.650 --> 22:40.068
Hey, Chip.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.700
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

22:52.623 --> 22:54.291
Is there something you wanted to...

22:57.753 --> 22:58.837
We need to talk.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.266
Take your family to work day?

23:11.266 --> 23:13.310
Hal's wife wanted to see the studio.

23:14.102 --> 23:17.022
Interesting choice
to do that interview today.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.691
It had been booked for weeks.

23:20.859 --> 23:21.902
Bradley...

23:24.071 --> 23:25.572
do we have a problem?

23:26.907 --> 23:27.741
No.

23:28.951 --> 23:30.077
Because in my experience,

23:30.077 --> 23:34.206
Hal doesn't show up unless things are
about to get fucked six ways to Sunday.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.958
Look, I am handling it.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.167
Like you did last time?

23:39.169 --> 23:40.879
Just stop interfering, Cory.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.966
I know you think you're helping,
but you're just making it worse.

23:52.766 --> 23:56.645
Fix it, or I will.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.553
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:29.553 --> 24:30.971
I'm sorry I'm late.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.141
I missed you too.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.311
- I need a drink. Can we get a drink? Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah.

24:37.311 --> 24:40.189
Did I tell you? I think Audra's pregnant.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.858
What? Really?

24:42.858 --> 24:45.944
Yeah. I walked past her dressing room,
and all the lights were off,

24:45.944 --> 24:48.030
and she was sitting
in front of the mirror...

24:48.030 --> 24:49.156
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.282
...rubbing her belly.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.326
Well, maybe she was meditating.

24:53.785 --> 24:54.953
Audra meditating?

24:54.953 --> 24:57.623
She talked through
our 9/11 moment of silence.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.000
- So, how's it going
- Yeah.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.502
with all the craziness over there?

25:03.128 --> 25:04.713
What craziness?

25:04.713 --> 25:06.173
Paul Marks. What's he like?

25:08.258 --> 25:10.511
Yeah. I don't think the deal is done.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.180
And who knows if it'll go through.

25:13.722 --> 25:15.057
- Right.
- Yeah.

25:21.730 --> 25:22.773
What are we doing?

25:24.942 --> 25:25.776
What do you mean?

25:27.903 --> 25:29.154
We meet up at Cory's party.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.407
You invite me to dinner and then cancel.

25:32.407 --> 25:35.327
And then tonight, you call me at
the last minute. Suddenly we're back on.

25:35.953 --> 25:38.747
And I don't know where your head is,
but I know it's not here.

25:38.747 --> 25:40.165
Well, I really--

25:42.042 --> 25:43.126
I wanted to see you.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.879
Did you really?
Or did you just need a drink?

25:47.506 --> 25:50.551
Look, Hal's in town
with Cheryl and the kid and--

25:50.551 --> 25:52.344
Right. Hal.

25:52.344 --> 25:56.890
No, it's not like that.
I know you hate him.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.475
- I don't hate Hal.
- Yes, you do.

25:58.475 --> 26:00.978
Whatever. It's fine.
I don't wanna get into it.

26:02.104 --> 26:06.191
Would you just talk to me?
I feel like we're on a bad first date.

26:17.119 --> 26:20.789
I should probably go. I--
They're gonna be wondering where I am.

26:20.789 --> 26:24.168
Bradley, it's me.
You can tell me anything.

26:27.921 --> 26:31.717
I'm a mess, okay?
And I don't want to drag you down with me.

26:32.259 --> 26:33.260
I'm sorry.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.138
I think I should get the check.

26:37.890 --> 26:38.891
Yeah.

27:23.227 --> 27:24.228
Hey.

27:25.521 --> 27:28.440
I really, really loved
that Scared Straight interview.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.192
- Oh, yeah?
- I just wanna say, message received.

27:30.192 --> 27:31.276
- All right.
- Meant a lot to me.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.778
- You don't want to get locked up, Hal.
- No, yeah.

27:32.778 --> 27:34.238
You think you're tough, but you're not.

27:34.238 --> 27:40.661
Listen to me. I need to do this
for my family, for my sobriety.

27:40.661 --> 27:41.912
- For your sobriety?
- Yes!

27:41.912 --> 27:46.750
Oh, my God. Please do not weaponize your
addiction to prove some fucking point.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.126
I mean, that is just a dick move.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.921
Have you even thought
about what this is going to do to me?

27:50.921 --> 27:52.005
Oh, my God. You're right.

27:52.005 --> 27:54.007
I haven't thought about
what's gonna happen to you,

27:54.007 --> 27:57.344
except for the fact that, like, you could
have deleted that footage, right?

27:57.344 --> 27:59.137
- All of it. You could have deleted it.
- That's a--

27:59.137 --> 28:01.598
That's what I thought that you would do
when I left DC.

28:02.099 --> 28:06.395
And then I saw it on TV, and I thought,
"Why the fuck would she use this?"

28:06.395 --> 28:07.479
And then I reali-- No.

28:07.479 --> 28:10.357
Because then I realized that
you will do anything to get ahead.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.608
- Me?
- Yes.

28:12.109 --> 28:14.194
You are gonna ruin our lives.
You know that, right?

28:14.194 --> 28:16.154
Well, you know what?
I learned from the best, right?

28:16.154 --> 28:18.782
You turned in Dad.
That kind of fucked us all up, right?

28:19.449 --> 28:20.576
- Wow.
- Except for you.

28:20.576 --> 28:21.910
You've come out on top, haven't you?

28:21.910 --> 28:24.997
Are you kidding me? Like,
you think this was some sort of long game

28:24.997 --> 28:27.499
I was playing to get to New York City
and somehow end up on the n--

28:27.499 --> 28:29.418
What the fuck are you even talking about?

28:31.170 --> 28:34.506
I know what it is like
to look at my father and have no respect.

28:35.424 --> 28:36.425
None.

28:37.676 --> 28:39.845
I don't want my daughter
to look at me like that.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.431
That would fucking kill me.

28:42.431 --> 28:44.433
You think your daughter's
gonna respect her dad

28:44.433 --> 28:46.351
who's locked up just like our fucking dad?

28:47.019 --> 28:50.272
You're gonna ruin her life. You're gonna
ruin Cheryl's life and ruin my life.

28:50.272 --> 28:51.690
You know what? You're drunk.

28:51.690 --> 28:54.526
I think that you should have some water
before you go to bed.

28:54.526 --> 28:57.279
You're Jesus Christ
on the goddamn cross. Really?

29:14.087 --> 29:15.088
Hey.

29:15.672 --> 29:17.591
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

29:17.591 --> 29:18.926
You're here early.

29:18.926 --> 29:22.679
Yeah, I just had some stuff
I had to clean off my desk.

29:24.765 --> 29:25.807
What's going on? You okay?

29:26.558 --> 29:31.855
Yeah, I'm--
You know, I really appreciate you

29:32.523 --> 29:36.235
just always supporting me
and having my back since I've been here.

29:36.235 --> 29:38.195
It just-- It means a lot.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.697
Okay, well, that sounds like a goodbye.

29:41.490 --> 29:43.367
Is NBN trying to poach you?

29:43.951 --> 29:47.829
No, I just forget to say it sometimes,
and I know what you've done.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.832
Yeah. And you didn't have to do
all that, you know?

29:50.832 --> 29:52.209
I know. Okay.

29:52.918 --> 29:55.170
- Oh, God. Honey, I have to go.
- Yeah.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.548
I'm interviewing Paul Marks later today.

29:58.382 --> 29:59.967
I know it's just been--

30:01.426 --> 30:02.427
What?

30:02.427 --> 30:06.014
Chip found out some information on him,

30:06.014 --> 30:08.141
and I know I'm gonna have to
go at him really hard.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.643
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.979
- Well...
- It's just not good.

30:11.979 --> 30:13.522
The deal could possibly blow up,

30:14.273 --> 30:16.900
and I hate the idea of
doing that to people.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.027
But if there really is something,

30:19.945 --> 30:21.530
- isn't it better to know now...
- Yes.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.282
- ...than too late?
- I know. I know.

30:23.949 --> 30:26.994
It's what we do.
We hold people to account, right?

30:28.203 --> 30:30.247
That's right. That's what we do.

30:30.247 --> 30:31.331
That's what we do.

30:31.331 --> 30:34.001
- Yeah.
- Okay. I'm around.

30:34.543 --> 30:35.711
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

30:35.711 --> 30:37.171
- Have a good interview.
- Thanks, honey.

30:59.234 --> 31:00.903
God, that was a long drive.

31:00.903 --> 31:02.821
- Yep.
- Okay, let's do this.

31:04.698 --> 31:05.699
Should we just go in?

31:05.699 --> 31:07.367
- I mean, yeah.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

31:09.828 --> 31:10.829
Hello?

31:13.457 --> 31:14.291
Hello?

31:17.961 --> 31:19.213
Hello!

31:20.047 --> 31:21.298
Oh, my gosh.

31:21.298 --> 31:22.508
Sorry. He's friendly.

31:22.508 --> 31:24.134
- Hi, there.
- Good. You found it.

31:24.134 --> 31:25.469
You're not dressed.

31:25.469 --> 31:28.055
- The turn-on can be a little tricky.
- Excuse me?

31:28.055 --> 31:29.640
Turning onto the road. It's unmarked.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.851
Oh, right. No, we actually-- We got it.

31:32.851 --> 31:37.898
So, this is quite a beautiful hidden gem
you have here. Wow.

31:38.398 --> 31:41.276
Listen, I know it's probably gonna
take you guys a couple minutes

31:41.276 --> 31:42.861
to get set up and whatnot.

31:43.487 --> 31:45.739
Help yourself to whatever you want,
and I will go get ready.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.366
Let's go. Buddy, come on. Let's go.

31:49.952 --> 31:52.079
Okay, okay. Hi.

31:54.915 --> 31:57.000
No, no. That's fine. Thanks.

32:01.463 --> 32:02.506
Good?

32:04.383 --> 32:05.926
Okay.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.598
So-- Sorry. What are the rules?

32:11.598 --> 32:12.683
What do you mean?

32:13.183 --> 32:15.227
Well, do I know you? Do I not know you?

32:15.227 --> 32:20.065
Oh, yeah. Just think of it like, you know,
we're just meeting for the first time.

32:21.483 --> 32:22.693
Easy.

32:22.693 --> 32:24.945
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

32:25.612 --> 32:26.613
All right.

32:27.781 --> 32:28.782
Chip.

32:29.825 --> 32:30.826
Okay.

32:30.826 --> 32:32.661
- All right. Everybody ready?
- Yes.

32:32.661 --> 32:33.745
- All set.
- Let's do this.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.247
Let's roll cameras, please.

32:35.247 --> 32:37.207
So, why don't you do interviews?

32:38.166 --> 32:40.878
- Well, I don't want to offend you.
- Oh, please, offend me.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.630
I think they're a waste of time, honestly.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.132
I think people come in with an agenda

32:45.132 --> 32:47.050
and wait for the other person
to prove them right.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.052
And I would
literally rather do anything else.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.804
I would rather go hunting
with Dick Cheney.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.598
I would rather stand in line at the DMV.

32:52.598 --> 32:55.309
Well, then why did you agree
to sit down with me?

32:55.976 --> 33:02.107
Because I think this deal is important,
and you asked me.

33:05.027 --> 33:07.154
Well, when someone with your resources

33:07.154 --> 33:09.448
acquires a company like UBA,

33:09.448 --> 33:10.949
it raises a lot of questions.

33:11.867 --> 33:15.704
So, why do you wanna add
a media empire to your portfolio?

33:16.205 --> 33:17.623
Well, I don't have one.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.458
So we're your trophy?

33:19.458 --> 33:23.337
No. I think there's tremendous
profit potential at UBA,

33:23.337 --> 33:24.588
and I hate fake news.

33:25.422 --> 33:27.591
Says the guy from big tech.

33:27.591 --> 33:30.719
Right. Okay. Sure. I get it.

33:30.719 --> 33:33.222
I think we can all agree at this point
it's probably healthier

33:33.222 --> 33:36.558
to smoke a pack of cigarettes
than it is to log on to Twitter, right?

33:36.558 --> 33:38.477
But good luck
keeping people from scrolling.

33:41.146 --> 33:42.731
I think the news can be fixed.

33:43.815 --> 33:47.319
And I'd like to give it a try
before it's too late.

33:47.319 --> 33:49.571
And you think you can fix the news?

33:49.571 --> 33:52.366
I don't see anybody else
with their hand raised.

33:52.366 --> 33:54.993
And what makes you think
you're qualified for the job?

33:54.993 --> 33:57.329
Well, the bar does seem
to be set pretty low.

33:59.790 --> 34:03.001
Sounds like you don't have a lot
of respect for people that do the news.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.671
Should we be concerned about that,

34:05.671 --> 34:08.215
partnering with someone
that doesn't respect us?

34:08.215 --> 34:10.342
I could ask you the very same question.

34:11.342 --> 34:15.264
You thought I was so bad for UBA
that you ditched the <i>Hyperion One</i> launch.

34:15.264 --> 34:16.598
Should I be concerned about you?

34:17.516 --> 34:20.686
I mean, that is what happened, right?
And this is <i>Alex Unfiltered</i>.

34:20.686 --> 34:24.857
Well, that might be what happened,
but it had nothing to do with respect.

34:24.857 --> 34:28.610
There were, and there are still,
concerns about you buying this company

34:28.610 --> 34:30.612
and I believe that the jury is still out.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.699
I certainly hear that.
That-- You've made that very, very clear.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.909
Is that why you were hanging out
outside my hotel?

34:42.833 --> 34:47.629
You know what?
Why don't we just take a quick break?

34:48.213 --> 34:49.715
- Okay. Sure.
- That okay?

34:50.299 --> 34:51.382
- Be right back.
- Okay.

34:56.263 --> 34:57.097
Are you doing okay?

34:57.097 --> 34:58.098
Yeah.

34:58.098 --> 35:01.768
Okay. Are you gonna ask him
about the Stanford student?

35:04.313 --> 35:05.689
Hey, nail his ass.

35:06.732 --> 35:09.610
I know. I'm on it.

35:09.610 --> 35:10.736
Okay.

35:28.795 --> 35:33.800
You ran an incubator in Palo Alto,
mentoring young innovators in tech.

35:34.384 --> 35:36.845
I did.
I started it during the dot-com boom.

35:36.845 --> 35:38.680
A lot of great ideas
came out of that project.

35:39.515 --> 35:40.807
But then you stepped away.

35:41.308 --> 35:45.604
Yes. Our aerospace division
started gaining traction.

35:45.604 --> 35:47.981
I was spending a lot more time in Texas,
so I handed it off.

35:50.108 --> 35:51.109
Any regrets?

35:53.070 --> 35:54.905
Not sure what you mean.

35:54.905 --> 35:58.492
Well, a former Stanford student
who was in that incubator

35:58.492 --> 36:00.160
claims to have written a code.

36:00.869 --> 36:03.997
A code that evolved
into the data analytics system

36:03.997 --> 36:06.333
that you sell to governments
around the world.

36:07.376 --> 36:09.419
Right. Well, that software
took years to develop

36:09.419 --> 36:13.048
and went through hundreds of iterations
before it became what it is today.

36:14.049 --> 36:17.052
Yes. But the initial idea was theirs.

36:17.052 --> 36:20.472
Well, the initial idea was,
if I recall correctly,

36:20.472 --> 36:23.600
a GPS blocker for activists
and dissidents,

36:23.600 --> 36:27.729
which we took to several VCs,
all of whom passed.

36:28.313 --> 36:30.148
So then you bought it instead.

36:31.358 --> 36:35.070
A billion-dollar idea
at a bargain price of 50 grand.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.407
- Is that what you paid? Fifty grand?
- I bought quite a few ideas

36:38.407 --> 36:39.575
out of that incubator.

36:40.158 --> 36:43.036
All of those deals were,
at the time, industry standard.

36:44.496 --> 36:46.331
Well, it also used to be industry standard

36:46.331 --> 36:49.668
that a director would fuck an actress
on a casting couch, so...

36:50.169 --> 36:53.672
Or a news anchor might have a button
underneath his desk to lock the door.

36:55.048 --> 36:57.593
Are you rich
because you stole someone else's idea?

36:58.302 --> 37:00.262
I never forced anybody
to sign any contracts.

37:00.262 --> 37:02.181
That person sold their idea on their own.

37:02.181 --> 37:06.810
But you did make them sign an NDA
and then took a progressive idea

37:06.810 --> 37:09.730
and converted it
into a predictive policing tool.

37:11.315 --> 37:14.151
Well, I mean, we both understand
the concept of an NDA.

37:14.735 --> 37:17.696
One person wins
and the other person is silenced.

37:18.447 --> 37:22.784
So, is it fair to use them
against young college students

37:22.784 --> 37:25.120
when they might not be experienced enough

37:25.120 --> 37:28.874
to understand the implications
of what they're signing?

37:28.874 --> 37:31.877
Now, everybody involved in
this transaction was an adult.

37:31.877 --> 37:34.171
Well, this student did not feel
very good about it.

37:34.755 --> 37:37.341
And, in fact,
suffered debilitating depression

37:38.091 --> 37:39.593
as well as a suicide attempt.

37:46.016 --> 37:49.895
Well, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

37:53.065 --> 37:55.651
Well, do you have any response?

37:57.402 --> 37:59.196
To this former student?

37:59.196 --> 38:00.906
To the people watching the interview?

38:04.034 --> 38:05.827
Well, I think that...

38:18.465 --> 38:22.302
You know, I used to sleep
on the floor of my factory,

38:22.970 --> 38:25.848
sometimes for weeks at a time.

38:25.848 --> 38:30.686
When we were developing
the first prototype for <i>Hyperion One</i>,

38:30.686 --> 38:34.815
my engineers and I would work 18,
20-some-odd hours every day.

38:37.818 --> 38:42.447
When I focus on something,
I tend to block out everything else.

38:46.702 --> 38:50.122
So when I finally went home,
my wife had left.

38:51.456 --> 38:57.754
She had taken everything that was hers,
and the house was a blank.

39:00.632 --> 39:03.260
I don't even know how long
she'd been gone. Could have been weeks.

39:06.513 --> 39:09.183
I had to take
a pretty hard look at myself.

39:11.560 --> 39:16.315
The way I treated other people.
The cost... of what I was doing.

39:20.819 --> 39:23.614
And I have since changed
my company's policies

39:23.614 --> 39:26.575
as well as my own personal behavior
and beliefs.

39:27.242 --> 39:32.706
So I think I probably owe that student,
at the very least,

39:34.583 --> 39:35.584
a conversation.

39:49.139 --> 39:50.140
Next question.

40:06.698 --> 40:10.661
While the President says he'll work
towards a solution to the current impasse,

40:10.661 --> 40:14.456
congressional leaders continue
to push back on several key points.

40:14.456 --> 40:16.875
And when we come back...

40:22.172 --> 40:23.173
When we come back...

40:26.760 --> 40:27.719
Bradley, what's up?

40:30.597 --> 40:31.974
<i>Bradley!</i>

40:32.683 --> 40:35.853
When we come back,
we'll take a closer look at homeschooling.

40:36.937 --> 40:39.189
We'll meet one mother who,
during the pandemic,

40:39.189 --> 40:43.360
decided her kids would never return
to their traditional classroom again.

40:45.863 --> 40:46.864
And we're out.

40:54.037 --> 40:54.872
Hi.

40:58.333 --> 41:01.503
- Brad's not here. She's--
- I know. I came to talk to you.

41:02.254 --> 41:03.255
Can I come in?

41:09.386 --> 41:13.098
I made a lot of assumptions about you
before even meeting you.

41:15.309 --> 41:16.560
That sounds about right.

41:17.477 --> 41:18.562
I think--

41:19.271 --> 41:23.525
I think I made Bradley choose between us
when your mom was sick.

41:24.902 --> 41:27.821
I think that's how Bradley felt,
and that wasn't fair.

41:28.822 --> 41:32.159
And I may have encouraged her...

41:34.244 --> 41:35.662
to cut you out of her life.

41:36.496 --> 41:38.332
So you could have her all for yourself?

41:44.296 --> 41:45.756
I'm sorry.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.092
What I mean is that...

41:52.846 --> 41:56.058
I think Bradley wants to be with me,
and I want that too.

41:57.059 --> 41:58.727
But we had dinner the other night,

41:58.727 --> 42:02.523
and she seemed really anxious
about starting things up again.

42:03.023 --> 42:06.527
And I think that had a lot to do with you.

42:07.361 --> 42:09.321
I mean, how I judged you.

42:09.321 --> 42:11.823
She doesn't talk to me
about those kinds of things.

42:11.823 --> 42:13.825
- I don't--
- Well, I think she's scared to.

42:14.660 --> 42:16.870
- Because whenever she brings you in--
- I fuck it up.

42:16.870 --> 42:18.830
- No. No.
- Yeah.

42:19.790 --> 42:22.709
You see her in a way
that no one else does.

42:23.210 --> 42:24.545
She can't hide with you.

42:29.633 --> 42:34.555
If you could just support us, I think
it would mean a lot to Bradley and to me.

42:35.722 --> 42:41.228
If I just had a chance,
I know I could make her happy.

42:51.238 --> 42:52.990
I'll think on it.

42:55.367 --> 42:56.577
I'll think on it, okay?

43:02.291 --> 43:03.500
Well, that was fun.

43:04.835 --> 43:05.919
When's it gonna air?

43:05.919 --> 43:07.963
Next week. We're actually
gonna be editing this weekend.

43:07.963 --> 43:11.258
So, Alex, you heading back to the city?

43:11.967 --> 43:14.136
Yeah, in a minute. Thanks, Chip.

43:14.136 --> 43:16.221
Okay. I'm having some ideas
on the shape of the show,

43:16.221 --> 43:19.099
so if you wanna talk while you drive,
cut the trailer tonight.

43:19.099 --> 43:22.102
- You know how Mia's always hounding us--
- Yeah, good.

43:22.102 --> 43:23.854
Sure. I'll call you from the car.

43:27.065 --> 43:28.483
Chip, let's go.

43:29.818 --> 43:32.154
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah, sorry. Let me walk you out.

43:34.823 --> 43:35.908
Just be careful on the turn.

43:35.908 --> 43:37.326
- Thanks, Paul.
- You know it, guys.

43:37.326 --> 43:38.785
- Have a good one.
- Thank you.

43:41.872 --> 43:43.207
Well, you survived that.

43:43.790 --> 43:45.167
Well, you didn't pull any punches.

43:45.167 --> 43:46.877
Oh, well, that's the idea.

43:49.379 --> 43:50.214
I'm curious though.

43:50.214 --> 43:53.175
How did you find out about her?
This Stanford student.

43:53.717 --> 43:57.804
You know I can't tell you that.
And honestly, I don't know who it is.

43:58.889 --> 44:01.266
Well, it's fair game that you did that.

44:02.142 --> 44:03.477
I like that you went there.

44:04.770 --> 44:06.021
- You liked that?
- Yeah.

44:06.021 --> 44:09.983
Most people in your position wouldn't
come after me like that, but you did.

44:10.609 --> 44:11.610
Impressive.

44:12.194 --> 44:16.240
Well, UBA has certain standards,
and this deal doesn't change that.

44:18.242 --> 44:19.660
Even if it does happen,

44:20.244 --> 44:23.372
it's, you know--
it's not like we're in bed together.

44:24.748 --> 44:28.752
- I mean it metaphorically speaking.
- Right.

44:28.752 --> 44:29.670
You know?

44:30.170 --> 44:31.171
And literally.

44:31.964 --> 44:36.426
No. We're not in bed.

44:36.426 --> 44:37.886
We should keep it that way.

44:41.598 --> 44:43.433
We're in furious agreement.

44:43.934 --> 44:45.435
I've never been more furious.

44:59.658 --> 45:01.535
I don't think we should do this.

45:02.369 --> 45:03.662
Right. Never happened.

45:07.165 --> 45:10.919
I'm gonna go grab my--
I forgot my-- Forgot my coat over here.

45:10.919 --> 45:13.380
No, where's-- My coat's right in my--

45:13.380 --> 45:14.840
Did I forget anything else?

45:15.799 --> 45:18.218
Did you forget anything else?
I don't think you forgot anything.

45:18.218 --> 45:19.386
I don't think I did.

46:32.376 --> 46:34.086
Let's get married in Niagara.

46:35.629 --> 46:36.630
- What?
- Let's do it.

46:37.172 --> 46:39.883
Let's get a justice of the peace
and some witnesses

46:39.883 --> 46:42.761
and some weird outfits
and just fucking do it.

46:44.179 --> 46:45.639
Is that a yes or--

46:45.639 --> 46:46.723
No.

46:47.975 --> 46:49.059
No.

46:50.519 --> 46:51.728
- No.
- I'm sorry.

46:53.647 --> 46:56.900
I thought this was what you wanted.
So, what is...

47:00.821 --> 47:04.658
What? Hold-- What?
Did I totally fucking misread this?

47:05.284 --> 47:08.745
You are the one who's been dropping
clues for, like, three months now,

47:08.745 --> 47:10.914
and you talked about a ring.

47:10.914 --> 47:14.585
I mean, maybe I didn't,
you know, propose in the best way.

47:14.585 --> 47:16.503
We were planning a huge interview.

47:17.087 --> 47:18.088
But...

47:19.840 --> 47:21.550
Just tell me what you want.
That's what we'll do.

47:21.550 --> 47:23.302
I mean, tell me what you want. We can--

47:23.302 --> 47:25.012
I want you to ask because of me.

47:26.638 --> 47:27.639
Not because of her.

47:32.102 --> 47:34.396
That's ridiculous.

47:37.149 --> 47:38.275
Come on.

48:03.550 --> 48:04.551
Hal?

48:06.595 --> 48:07.596
Cheryl?

48:46.385 --> 48:48.929
Wow. That was a really nice way
to wake up.

48:54.017 --> 48:56.061
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.038
- There you go.
- Oh, God.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.332
Okay.

49:21.795 --> 49:22.796
Cory.

49:22.796 --> 49:23.881
<i>Hey. Too early?</i>

49:23.881 --> 49:25.549
No. No, never.

49:25.549 --> 49:29.469
Listen, whatever interview stunt
Alex was up to, don't worry.

49:29.469 --> 49:31.889
We won't use it unless it works for us.

49:31.889 --> 49:35.976
Went well, actually.
I think it'll be good for perception.

49:35.976 --> 49:39.062
<i>Well, that's great to hear. Alex is--</i>

49:39.062 --> 49:41.106
She's passionate about her work.

49:41.106 --> 49:44.818
Well, she was phenomenal.

49:45.944 --> 49:47.362
Stunning, really.

49:48.322 --> 49:50.407
Kinda blew my mind,
if you wanna know the truth.

49:53.493 --> 49:54.620
Well...

49:56.580 --> 49:59.458
you can see
why she's such a key asset to the company.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.751
Sure do.

50:03.754 --> 50:06.882
Hey, listen. I know marketing
is pushing for a new logo,

50:06.882 --> 50:10.802
but I don't think Hyperion needs to be
so front-facing in the branding.

50:11.386 --> 50:15.557
Keep it simple, right?
The less friction, the better.

50:16.266 --> 50:18.810
<i>Good. On that, we are simpatico.</i>

50:20.020 --> 50:22.481
Okay. I will talk to you.

50:22.481 --> 50:23.565
<i>Perfect. I--</i>

50:26.193 --> 50:28.570
- Wow.
- Wow.

50:43.502 --> 50:45.254
Laura.

50:47.047 --> 50:49.049
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:56.306 --> 50:59.977
I'm sorry about dinner
the other night. I was awful.

51:02.646 --> 51:05.732
And-- It-- And it was fine.

51:06.233 --> 51:07.359
Hal is fine.

51:08.986 --> 51:09.987
It was nothing.

51:14.283 --> 51:18.245
I just miss you. I really miss you.

51:33.594 --> 51:37.806
<i>You know, I used to sleep on the floor
of my factory,</i>

51:38.432 --> 51:41.435
<i>sometimes for weeks at a time.</i>

51:41.435 --> 51:46.190
<i>When we were developing
the first prototype for</i> Hyperion One<i>,</i>

51:46.190 --> 51:50.569
<i>my engineers and I would work 18,
20-some-odd hours every day.</i>

51:50.569 --> 51:51.737
How does it play?

51:51.737 --> 51:55.908
<i>When I focus on something,
I tend to block out every--</i>

51:58.785 --> 51:59.912
You come off well.

52:01.914 --> 52:03.248
You could've talked to me.

52:05.334 --> 52:06.752
I had no idea you felt that way.

52:07.711 --> 52:09.713
I wasn't sure how I felt.

52:11.632 --> 52:12.674
How about now?

52:13.550 --> 52:16.428
I'll have my lawyers reach out.
I can leave quietly.

52:17.638 --> 52:20.599
I don't wanna make this transition
any more uncomfortable.

52:20.599 --> 52:22.351
So, you're gonna quit?

52:22.935 --> 52:24.478
Yeah. I think it's for the best.

52:24.478 --> 52:27.523
Stella, come on. UBA is stuck in the past.

52:28.106 --> 52:31.235
They need someone with a vision
to move this place forward.

52:32.778 --> 52:35.072
I think that person is you.

52:36.281 --> 52:38.867
- Cory might disagree.
- Cory won't be here.

52:43.330 --> 52:45.332
I'm sending you an offer of employment.

52:45.832 --> 52:50.420
As soon as the shareholders agree
to this merger, you will take Cory's job.

52:54.341 --> 52:56.009
That's a big leap.

52:56.510 --> 52:58.428
There's gonna be a lot of pushback.

52:58.428 --> 53:00.556
Well, what did we always say?
We don't play by the rules--

53:00.556 --> 53:01.765
We make them.

53:04.893 --> 53:06.270
What do you think, Stella?

53:08.313 --> 53:09.523
You wanna run this place?
