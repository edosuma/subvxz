WEBVTT

00:06.990 --> 00:09.481
<i>Previously on</i> ER...

00:09.659 --> 00:12.628
Okay, so that we both understand,
this is personal.

00:12.796 --> 00:17.893
- Benton hates my guts.
- No, he just can't show it.

00:18.034 --> 00:22.334
Divorce papers. I'm giving you
the house, the car, everything.

00:22.505 --> 00:24.530
Do you have it?

00:24.741 --> 00:26.800
- Tell me if you need me.
- You'd better take it.

00:30.547 --> 00:34.540
- Ma'am, we're leaving.
- I'll never forget you.

00:42.158 --> 00:46.618
Meckel's is like a finger protruding
from the antimesenteric border...

00:46.796 --> 00:49.390
Then you bake it
in a 400-degree oven...

00:49.566 --> 00:52.933
...occasionally attach itself to
the umbilical area...

00:53.069 --> 00:56.197
...fresh rosemary, a little pepper...

00:56.406 --> 01:00.706
...pipe connecting it to the outside.
...a clove of garlic under the skin.

01:00.877 --> 01:03.141
I'm trying to visualize here.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.714
Try visualizing setting up soon.
Your intern is late.

01:06.883 --> 01:09.511
Gloves and gown for Dr. Keaton.

01:09.686 --> 01:13.417
- What size gloves does she wear?
- I don't keep a chart.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.956
- Morning, Dr. Benton.
- You're late.

01:16.126 --> 01:20.187
- Two minutes.
- You have to set up for Keaton.

01:20.363 --> 01:25.062
- You know her glove size?
- Seven and a half, no powder.

01:27.203 --> 01:32.231
"A man pushes a vacuum cleaner
with a force of 70 newtons...

01:32.442 --> 01:36.776
...and moves the vacuum cleaner five
meters. How much work has he done?"

01:36.946 --> 01:40.677
Let's start with the unlikelihood of
a man pushing a vacuum cleaner.

01:41.384 --> 01:43.978
Work equals force times distance.

01:44.154 --> 01:48.090
- Work equals one half of m-d squared.
- It's both.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.952
- I'm never going to pass.
- It's just a midterm.

01:52.128 --> 01:55.757
- It's one half of our grade.
- You can study all day.

01:55.932 --> 01:58.992
No, William,
I have to go to work now.

01:59.135 --> 02:03.196
So you're not going to eat that?

02:06.643 --> 02:08.941
Okay, the daily specials are...?

02:09.112 --> 02:14.573
Doubled-over gas pains in 2,
hemorrhoids in 3.

02:14.751 --> 02:18.585
- And a puking toddler in 5.
- Has everybody had flu shots?

02:18.755 --> 02:22.623
I'd rather puke.
Gant, can you handle hemorrhoids?

02:22.792 --> 02:26.660
Hey, that leg ulcer
in 1 's getting cranky.

02:26.830 --> 02:29.765
Poor kid. Got the dark cloud today?

02:29.933 --> 02:33.869
Twelve patients already, plus
a rule-out appy and a rigid abdomen.

02:34.003 --> 02:36.233
- Where's Mark?
- Getting ready for a staff meeting.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.773
Weaver and the sound of
her own voice, a love story.

02:39.943 --> 02:43.504
- Dr. Greene called this one.
- Mark called a meeting?

02:43.713 --> 02:44.975
Do I look delusional?

02:45.148 --> 02:50.415
Meckel's diverticulum.
Start with the rule of twos.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.079
Meckel's occurs in 2 percent
of the population.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.988
The diverticulum is located
2 feet from the ileocecal valve.

02:58.161 --> 03:01.392
- Diagnosis?
- Technetium pertechnetate imaging.

03:01.564 --> 03:04.931
- Complications?
- Intestinal obstruction, hemorrhage...

03:05.068 --> 03:06.535
...inflammation and perforation.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.671
- Treatment?
- Excision.

03:08.838 --> 03:13.673
- You know this stuff cold.
- Only if Keaton thinks so.

03:15.378 --> 03:20.372
They have to give me time off
for my honeymoon.

03:20.550 --> 03:24.611
- I worked hard, I deserve a reward.
- Your man is your reward.

03:24.787 --> 03:28.814
Forty years of snoring, hairs in the
bathtub and "Honey, can you find...?"

03:28.992 --> 03:32.223
I'll bring it up at
the Re-engineering Committee.

03:32.395 --> 03:35.558
- Gant's screaming for a suture kit.
- I put it under his nose.

03:35.732 --> 03:37.791
He needs a honeymoon.

03:37.934 --> 03:41.802
- Is Mark okay?
- He called a staff meeting.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.768
Mark Greene?

03:43.973 --> 03:47.374
Glasses? Receding hairline?
Broken heart?

03:47.577 --> 03:51.308
- Scan demonstrated a diverticulum.
- What caused this one to bleed?

03:51.481 --> 03:54.279
Presence of aberrant gastric mucosa
in the Meckel's.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.886
Very good, Peter.
There's the ileocecal junction.

03:58.054 --> 03:59.988
I see it.

04:00.156 --> 04:04.320
Now follow my motion
as I move the bowel proximally.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.553
- Got it!
- There's the Meckel's.

04:07.597 --> 04:11.431
- You've prepped, haven't you?
- Just standard visualizing.

04:11.567 --> 04:15.970
Sorry to interrupt. I've got to steal
Dr. Benton. It's a perfed ulcer.

04:16.139 --> 04:21.236
Dr. Grady was going to assist,
but his wife's gone into labor.

04:21.444 --> 04:23.571
You can't argue with Mother Nature.

04:23.780 --> 04:27.272
- I'm not prepped for that.
- You could do it in your sleep.

04:27.450 --> 04:30.908
Go ahead, Peter.
John can take over the camera.

04:33.656 --> 04:36.716
Since we're short one Resident,
things will be a bit tight.

04:36.893 --> 04:41.091
- We have a kind of controlled chaos.
- Not that controlled.

04:41.264 --> 04:44.358
We're going to fix that with teamwork
and a new schedule.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.459
I've made up a chart to illustrate
how it's going to work.

04:48.638 --> 04:53.871
Every doctor has been designated
a color. Green is obviously taken.

04:54.077 --> 04:57.945
Weaver is yellow, Gant red,
Sanders orange, Ross is blue.

04:58.114 --> 05:02.551
- Doug, you have a problem?
- No, just call me "Mr. Blue."

05:02.719 --> 05:07.349
It'll be up in the Admit area today.
Learn it, know it, do it.

05:07.523 --> 05:09.650
Excellent starting point, Mark.

05:09.826 --> 05:13.284
I'd like to bring up food
at the Admit desk.

05:13.463 --> 05:15.863
Someone spilled guava juice
on my labs.

05:16.032 --> 05:22.904
No uncovered, free-standing liquids
in the Admit area. Let's get busy.

05:23.506 --> 05:26.066
Did I miss something?

05:26.275 --> 05:30.234
It's going to be a long day.
Who drinks guava juice?

05:30.446 --> 05:35.145
Mark, wait up!
Your chart was nice. Very colorful.

05:35.318 --> 05:39.755
- But "free-standing liquids"?
- Well, if they're spilling liquids...

05:39.922 --> 05:43.585
You're heart is broken,
and you're overreacting.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.856
No, I'm doing my job. The last
few months I've been distracted.

05:48.031 --> 05:52.331
And despite what's going on
with Susan, you get the job done.

05:52.468 --> 05:56.734
No, I'm letting Kerry Weaver do my job,
and that's going to stop.

05:56.906 --> 06:00.171
I'm the Senior Attending.
It's time for me to take control.

06:00.376 --> 06:04.073
So you're going to
step back up, so to speak?

06:04.247 --> 06:07.341
- Everything else okay?
- It's fine.

06:07.517 --> 06:10.543
- Lf you ever want to talk...
- Everything else is fine.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:04.373 --> 07:08.309
I've already had four cases of flu.
Should I mention the "shot" word?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.069
Had mine.

07:10.279 --> 07:13.407
- How about you, Randi?
- I take garlic pills.

07:13.583 --> 07:17.815
- What about you, Carol?
- Who's taking this guy?

07:17.987 --> 07:23.425
- I'll take it! Where's Dr. Gant?
- He took an admit up to O.R.

07:23.593 --> 07:28.792
54-year-old man took a 15-foot fall
from a ladder. Alert, vitals stable.

07:28.965 --> 07:34.028
BP's 130 over 90. Possible
fractured left pelvis and tib fib.

07:34.170 --> 07:37.606
Take him to Trauma 1.
Page Dr. Gant. Mark, I can use you.

07:37.807 --> 07:39.968
I'll be there in a sec.

07:40.176 --> 07:43.942
- Doug, the board is full.
- Luck of the draw. No Pedes.

07:44.113 --> 07:47.446
The adult anatomy
is remarkably similar.

07:47.617 --> 07:53.180
Would a 50-year-old with chest pains
like a baby doctor?

07:53.356 --> 07:58.817
Arthritic diabetic in 4, rule-out
MI in 3. Ask if you need help.

07:58.995 --> 08:02.487
I don't know if I'm
color-coordinated enough.

08:02.665 --> 08:06.658
"A red quark is attracted to an anti-red
quark. Is it a gluon or a meson?"

08:06.802 --> 08:11.171
Thank you for pointing out
something else I know nothing about.

08:13.643 --> 08:17.579
Mostly in my legs today. Chest pains.

08:17.780 --> 08:20.408
I guess it's a vaso-occlusive crisis.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.952
- You understand your disease well.
- I've had sickle cell all my life.

08:25.121 --> 08:29.057
Temp's 101,
BP 110 over 80. Tachy at 110.

08:29.225 --> 08:33.285
- What do you take for pain?
- Darvocet usually works. Not today.

08:33.462 --> 08:37.626
We'll get you something stronger
as soon as we get an IV going.

08:37.767 --> 08:42.260
Get a CBC with rectic count,
chest film and start a line.

08:42.438 --> 08:47.398
O-2, 2 liters by nasal cannula and
5 mgs of morphine. Can you hang on?

08:47.610 --> 08:50.545
If you hear me screaming,
you'll have your answer.

08:51.581 --> 08:54.209
Simple patch closure should do here.

08:54.383 --> 08:58.285
- What did I pull you away from?
- Meckel's.

08:58.454 --> 09:02.151
Goodness! Baptism by fire.

09:02.325 --> 09:05.886
- I was holding my own.
- Still, it's tough, isn't it?

09:06.062 --> 09:07.495
What do you mean?

09:07.663 --> 09:10.291
You've chosen
the most difficult elective.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.435
"Many are called,
but few are chosen."

09:14.570 --> 09:17.038
- Did Keaton say something?
- Retract, please.

09:17.206 --> 09:20.505
I mean, did she say
how I was doing?

09:21.177 --> 09:26.410
- Lf you're concerned, ask her.
- I'm not concerned.

09:26.582 --> 09:30.074
I'm not perfect, but Keaton knows
I could have handled that Meckel's.

09:30.253 --> 09:34.314
"A man's reach should exceed
his grasp, else what's a heaven for?"

09:34.490 --> 09:37.288
Browning. Or was it Keats?

09:37.460 --> 09:39.587
They're all
a bunch of hopheads anyway.

09:43.532 --> 09:45.591
Peter, what are you doing?

09:49.572 --> 09:52.097
Give me a broader scope. Good.

09:52.308 --> 09:58.577
- How late are you on, Dr. Carter?
- Not late. Seven.

09:58.748 --> 10:05.677
- Big plans?
- No. Maybe just dinner, eating.

10:06.255 --> 10:10.555
I was thinking of Indian food myself.

10:10.726 --> 10:14.355
You've got a problem, Shirley?

10:14.530 --> 10:21.094
I'm sure she doesn't. It's good for
the sinuses. It's the spice.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.764
Hold still, please. Good.

10:24.974 --> 10:30.037
- Maybe I'll order in and rent a movie.
- My VCR's broken.

10:31.580 --> 10:36.108
Which is probably why
I'm not going to, myself.

10:36.285 --> 10:38.879
Rent a movie, that is. Tonight.

10:39.055 --> 10:43.788
- You'll just eat and call it a day?
- That's probably what I should do.

10:43.959 --> 10:47.725
Study. Prep for tomorrow.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.728
Cumin.

10:51.634 --> 10:55.536
That's the spice. Cumin.

10:57.173 --> 11:00.199
BP's 120 over 80.
Heart rate's 90. Resps 30.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.139
He's HIV-positive. Complained of
shortness of breath.

11:03.312 --> 11:06.475
Al Boulet?
Is he some relative of Jeanie's?

11:06.649 --> 11:09.049
Not that I know of.

11:11.320 --> 11:16.451
Al Boulet? Dr. Greene.
Any relation to Jeanie Boulet?

11:16.625 --> 11:18.616
We're divorced.

11:18.794 --> 11:24.357
- Are you having trouble breathing?
- Just a little. Nothing big.

11:24.500 --> 11:30.564
- When did you test positive for HIV?
- About six months ago.

11:30.773 --> 11:35.335
You're on AZT, 3TC
and protease inhibitor.

11:35.544 --> 11:40.345
Your last T-cell count was 200?

11:40.516 --> 11:44.646
CBC, chest film
and sputum indication.

11:44.820 --> 11:48.756
O-2, nasal cannula, 4 liters.

11:48.924 --> 11:54.863
Bactrim, 4 amps, IV piggyback
and 60 mg Solu-Medrol, IV.

11:55.030 --> 11:58.397
And let's admit Mr. Boulet
to Medicine.

12:01.904 --> 12:06.432
So when did you get divorced?

12:06.642 --> 12:09.873
Separated about a year.

12:10.045 --> 12:12.673
Divorce just came through.

12:14.116 --> 12:17.517
The new float system's working well.

12:17.686 --> 12:21.247
ER and ICU both had some
adjustment problems...

12:21.424 --> 12:24.985
...but altogether,
things are settling down.

12:25.161 --> 12:30.326
Risk Management is fine.
Incident reports haven't increased.

12:30.466 --> 12:32.798
How long is this floating
going to last?

12:33.569 --> 12:36.834
Indefinitely.
It's not a band-aid, it's the cure.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.236
It's being negotiated
into the contracts?

12:39.442 --> 12:45.608
Financial Affairs is pleased, but we
must cut non-physician-related care.

12:45.781 --> 12:49.615
- Meaning the nurses?
- Nurses don't generate the revenue.

12:49.785 --> 12:53.653
- What about saving lives?
- They don't do that either.

12:53.823 --> 12:58.317
- The dean is just talking statistics.
- Averages, numbers, whatever.

12:58.494 --> 13:03.431
In the ER, nurses are in
trauma situations every day.

13:03.599 --> 13:08.093
It's going to hurt patients if floor
nurses set up the wrong lavage kit.

13:08.237 --> 13:10.137
You want a lawsuit over that one?

13:10.306 --> 13:14.800
We're here to iron out these problems
before your contract's up.

13:15.010 --> 13:18.810
- Have you got a suggestion?
- Stop floating them.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.115
ER nurses are not interchangeable.

13:22.284 --> 13:25.651
They work differently, longer
and the stakes are higher.

13:25.821 --> 13:28.312
Should they get
preferential treatment?

13:28.491 --> 13:34.020
You should give the patients nurses
trained in handling crisis.

13:34.196 --> 13:37.393
What do we say to Pedes or OB/G YN
when they complain?

13:40.202 --> 13:45.196
Tell them it's like triage.
Critical cases come first.

13:48.777 --> 13:53.407
Hey, Jeanie. I just treated
your husband, Al.

13:54.116 --> 13:55.913
Ex-husband.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.885
I didn't know you had been
going through all this.

14:00.055 --> 14:02.523
It's Al who's going through it.

14:03.125 --> 14:06.458
I'm doing what I can to help.

14:06.629 --> 14:10.121
I guess you've been
separated for a while.

14:10.299 --> 14:13.632
The marriage was over
long before that.

14:13.769 --> 14:18.331
- I guess you didn't get tested.
- I did, but I was negative.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.702
I'm glad.

14:20.910 --> 14:26.371
- Dr. Gant needs this suture kit.
- That's a central-line kit.

14:26.582 --> 14:28.709
You're right.

14:28.884 --> 14:30.511
Thank you.

14:33.556 --> 14:38.858
- When did the chest pains start?
- This morning right after breakfast.

14:39.028 --> 14:42.589
- What did you eat?
- Toast with raspberry jam.

14:42.765 --> 14:47.395
- Jams can be pretty acidic.
- I've had raspberry jam for 40 years.

14:47.536 --> 14:50.937
It doesn't give me heartburn.
I know heartburn.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.701
I'm sure you do. Get a 12-lead,
pulse ox and chest film.

14:54.910 --> 15:00.371
- And maybe cardiac enzymes?
- Are you on any medication?

15:00.583 --> 15:03.347
Of course I am, I'm 73.

15:04.720 --> 15:09.817
Digoxin for my heart,
and Allopurinol for my gout.

15:09.992 --> 15:14.725
Glipizide for diabetes,
and Simvastatin for...

15:14.897 --> 15:18.697
I never can remember this one.
Why am I taking this one?

15:18.834 --> 15:22.031
- High cholesterol.
- That one's very important.

15:23.839 --> 15:27.969
- Yes, I...
- And Famotidine...

15:39.788 --> 15:42.655
- You got a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

15:42.825 --> 15:46.420
I think we might have a problem
with Jeanie Boulet.

15:46.595 --> 15:51.623
This morning I treated her husband Al.
He has AIDS.

15:51.767 --> 15:54.429
- Did she mention it to you?
- Why would she?

15:54.603 --> 15:59.302
- She claims she tested negative.
- We'll have to take her word for it.

15:59.508 --> 16:03.706
- Doesn't this make you uncomfortable?
- Not especially.

16:03.879 --> 16:08.179
She says she's negative.
What else can we do?

16:08.350 --> 16:10.716
I'm surprised at your lack of concern.

16:10.886 --> 16:14.344
It's a lack of alarm, Mark.
There's a difference.

16:17.192 --> 16:22.459
I'm in the tall grass,
so I take the 5-iron...

16:24.667 --> 16:29.001
...and I sail that puppy
but 2 inches from the cup.

16:29.171 --> 16:34.040
It was poetry. It was a sonnet.
It was practically a haiku.

16:34.209 --> 16:36.973
Excuse me, Dr. Morgenstern.
Are we done?

16:37.146 --> 16:39.011
Looks good to me.

16:41.050 --> 16:43.143
Thank you, Peter.

16:44.887 --> 16:48.846
- What happened to pelvic pain in 2?
- A ruptured ectopic. She's in surgery.

16:49.024 --> 16:54.758
- Why didn't you erase the name?
- I called up the chart on Al Boulet.

16:54.930 --> 16:59.333
- He was Kerry Weaver's patient?
- Lf that's what it says.

16:59.468 --> 17:05.599
- So the Indian food has a purpose?
- I'm preparing for Pakistan.

17:05.808 --> 17:10.006
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?
- I haven't told anyone but Anspaugh.

17:10.179 --> 17:14.080
You're not sleeping with
Anspaugh. Are you?

17:16.251 --> 17:20.153
- Maybe...
- We got it. We'll take it.

17:20.888 --> 17:23.756
Listen. It's a great opportunity.

17:23.925 --> 17:29.694
We'll teach surgical techniques to
Pakistani surgeons. We'll help them.

17:29.865 --> 17:33.357
- Don't they need help in Indianapolis?
- It's only four months.

17:33.502 --> 17:35.527
- Didn't you say six?
- It could be.

17:35.704 --> 17:41.768
Then it can be a year or five. Next
thing you know, you're Mother Teresa.

17:43.212 --> 17:46.978
Did you have
long-term plans for us, John?

17:47.149 --> 17:50.414
Well...

17:50.586 --> 17:52.884
You know...

17:53.055 --> 17:58.391
Neither did I, so why don't we go on
having fun for the next few weeks.

17:58.560 --> 18:03.122
- Same kind of fun, though, right?
- Yes, the same kind of fun.

18:04.700 --> 18:08.431
I had a patient present
with PCP pneumonia...

18:08.604 --> 18:11.505
...and tested positive for HIV
six months ago.

18:11.707 --> 18:16.201
I'm worried he didn't tell his wife.

18:16.411 --> 18:20.108
- I need to see if she was tested.
- Those are private files.

18:21.049 --> 18:23.847
In the case of spousal report,
I'm allowed to check.

18:24.019 --> 18:29.924
You're allowed to tell the other spouse,
not to look into private files.

18:30.092 --> 18:34.961
Give me a break.
I don't think this guy is telling her.

18:43.705 --> 18:49.143
- Okay. Name?
- Jeanie Boulet. B-O-U-L-E-T.

19:04.092 --> 19:06.185
The Re-engineering Committee's
a joke.

19:06.361 --> 19:11.321
I should have spent my time studying.
I don't know iodine from cosine.

19:11.466 --> 19:15.562
One is an element that you find
in an antiseptic...

19:15.737 --> 19:19.833
...and the other has to do with
right angles or hypotenuse.

19:20.042 --> 19:25.378
- How did you manage to get through it?
- We could bring one sheet to the exam.

19:25.547 --> 19:29.210
I had all the formulas written on it.
I brought a really big sheet.

19:30.452 --> 19:33.512
- Have you seen Weaver?
- What color was she?

19:33.689 --> 19:35.816
Never mind.

19:35.991 --> 19:40.792
I've been waiting for two hours, and
I have a luncheon in 20 minutes.

19:40.963 --> 19:43.454
- We'll be right there, Mrs...?
- Murison.

19:43.632 --> 19:48.467
If I don't get my B-12 shot,
I might as well resign from my job.

19:48.604 --> 19:53.337
Gant, can you...? Yes!
You give Mrs. Murison a B-12 shot.

19:53.542 --> 19:57.034
I've got 17 surgical patients,
she's not one of them.

19:57.246 --> 19:59.976
I'm sorry, you have to wait.

20:00.148 --> 20:02.946
Natalie, do you get
a lot of ear infections?

20:03.118 --> 20:07.987
Just give me the amoxicillin.
I have a play date.

20:08.156 --> 20:13.219
You don't need to look!
Just give me the antibiotic!

20:13.395 --> 20:18.230
Augmentin will be fine,
if you're worried about resistance.

20:18.367 --> 20:22.133
- You know a lot about a lot of things.
- Yes, I do.

20:22.304 --> 20:27.867
So you want to tell Nurse Hathaway
about Coulomb's Law?

20:28.076 --> 20:33.036
That's the law of electrostatics. The
force between two charged particles...

20:33.248 --> 20:35.546
...is proportional to
the product of their charges.

20:35.717 --> 20:41.246
And inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between them.

20:41.957 --> 20:46.724
- You can't give me another shot?
- You've had two already.

20:46.895 --> 20:48.988
Jeanie?

20:50.165 --> 20:53.498
I've got a patient in sickle crisis.
She's in a lot of pain.

20:53.669 --> 20:58.299
Can you evaluate her? She needs
more narcotics, maybe an admission.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.965
Right now I need you
to cover the Waiting Room.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.635
About 12 people need to be triaged.

21:05.847 --> 21:09.214
I'm going to handle this
from here, understand?

21:13.889 --> 21:17.757
So what kind of movie do you
want to get? I was thinking...

21:17.926 --> 21:21.362
...maybe a comedy.
Or maybe a comedy.

21:21.530 --> 21:27.628
No. Tonight you're going to participate
in a Carter family tradition.

21:27.769 --> 21:32.570
Every year at this time, the intrepid
Carter male goes out into the woods.

21:32.774 --> 21:37.473
He picks out a fir tree, and with his
Protestant hands, he cuts it down.

21:37.646 --> 21:41.878
- We're going to cut down a tree?
- The Carter family Christmas tree.

21:42.050 --> 21:46.146
- I don't saw after hours.
- Don't worry, that's my job.

21:46.321 --> 21:51.486
- Dr. Benton. How was the ulcer?
- Fine.

21:51.660 --> 21:55.460
I saw the thyroglossal duct on
the board and was hoping to assist.

21:55.630 --> 22:00.829
I haven't done a lot of neck surgery,
and since I missed the Meckel's...

22:00.969 --> 22:03.733
I already called in Wallace to assist.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.965
Is there any possibility
of rescheduling, considering...?

22:07.175 --> 22:10.144
There'll be plenty of
other opportunities, Peter.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.178
Carter, don't you have
something to do?

22:14.349 --> 22:16.146
No, I'm all caught up.

22:16.318 --> 22:19.515
- What about post-op notes?
- On the charts. I'm done.

22:32.467 --> 22:35.459
That's it, I'm done.
I'm going to lunch.

22:35.637 --> 22:38.504
- Earache in 4.
- I'm not going to lunch.

22:38.707 --> 22:42.939
- Carter! Otitis media in 4.
- Sorry, I beeped him.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.602
You might want to
check on your friend Gant.

22:45.814 --> 22:51.081
Surgical admits are piling up. You've
got four patients, he's got 20.

22:51.253 --> 22:53.847
And give him
these labs on lung cancer.

22:55.490 --> 22:59.153
You heard I was here?
I'm better now, must be the Jell-O.

22:59.327 --> 23:02.228
- Why did you tell Dr. Greene about me?
- I didn't.

23:02.764 --> 23:07.064
- How does he know I'm positive?
- I guess he just assumed.

23:07.202 --> 23:10.933
- He's not assuming, he knows.
- It didn't come from me.

23:11.106 --> 23:13.165
Couldn't you have gone to
a different hospital?

23:13.809 --> 23:17.870
- I know the doctors here.
- I know the doctors here!

23:19.981 --> 23:23.917
Even if they found out,
they couldn't fire you, could they?

23:24.086 --> 23:27.078
Think about what I'm going through.
This is not just about you.

23:27.255 --> 23:31.419
- I know it's not just about me...
- Then act like it.

23:33.028 --> 23:35.019
Jeanie!

23:38.333 --> 23:43.361
I know how mad you are at me,
and you have a right to be.

23:47.943 --> 23:52.243
Living with AIDS,
that's nothing, but...

23:55.417 --> 23:58.784
...knowing I gave it to you...

24:02.657 --> 24:05.922
...there's no pill for that.

24:07.996 --> 24:12.433
I just have to face it...

24:12.567 --> 24:14.467
...every day.

24:18.907 --> 24:22.866
Hating me might feel good,
but it won't change anything.

24:24.479 --> 24:28.779
It doesn't feel good, Al.
Nothing about this feels good.

24:35.924 --> 24:39.223
I don't see Weaver as yellow,
but more in the red family.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.487
Something in burnt sienna.

24:41.663 --> 24:44.996
- Lavender is too pastel for Doyle.
- She's more like an eggplant.

24:45.133 --> 24:48.796
- Are you redecorating my board?
- It's constructive criticism.

24:48.970 --> 24:51.438
- Mark, I need to speak with you.
- Just a second.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.301
I'll wait outside.

24:58.947 --> 25:01.575
- What are you doing?
- I should ask you the same.

25:01.750 --> 25:06.153
Why is Jeanie checking vital signs?
She's not a health risk.

25:06.321 --> 25:09.882
Maybe you know that, but I've never
assessed her condition.

25:10.058 --> 25:12.891
Why didn't you tell me
you treated her husband?

25:13.061 --> 25:15.393
- You lied to me.
- It wasn't your business.

25:15.564 --> 25:18.465
If someone in my ER is HIV-positive,
it's my business.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.160
Our ER!
You don't know if she's positive.

25:21.336 --> 25:23.463
I checked with Medical Records.

25:25.173 --> 25:28.768
- Her confidential file?
- You wouldn't tell me the truth.

25:28.977 --> 25:33.812
Nice try, but there's no excuse
for what you did, and you know it.

25:36.017 --> 25:40.886
Hey! I heard you could use a hand,
that you're getting buried.

25:41.056 --> 25:44.253
I don't mind, you've bailed me out
when I was under.

25:44.426 --> 25:49.830
Benton wants me to pull my weight.
He'll not get another shot at me.

25:49.998 --> 25:53.525
Lower abdominal pain.
Ruled out small bowel obstruction.

26:02.210 --> 26:06.271
We may have a problem in the ER.
I thought you should know about it.

26:06.448 --> 26:10.384
Is this going to give me acid reflux?
If so, save it til I'm done.

26:10.552 --> 26:16.718
We may have a worker
that's HIV-positive.

26:16.891 --> 26:21.351
I've removed the person
from direct patient care.

26:21.529 --> 26:26.296
I hope you didn't say why, or else
we'll get sued for discrimination.

26:26.434 --> 26:30.564
- No. What's the hospital policy?
- We'll deal with it...

26:30.739 --> 26:33.708
...not race at it
like a herd of buffalo.

26:33.875 --> 26:37.777
First thing I want to do
is talk to Legal. Does Kerry know?

26:38.380 --> 26:40.245
That's part of the problem.

26:40.415 --> 26:44.852
Kerry may have known for six months
without informing anyone.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.456
Good. I want you
to be equally discreet.

26:48.623 --> 26:52.491
By keeping it to herself, Kerry might
have left us open for litigation.

26:52.661 --> 26:56.893
I know that,
but right now it's just suspicion.

26:57.032 --> 27:01.492
And please
don't correct me if I'm wrong.

27:07.342 --> 27:10.675
- I had a dream like this once.
- Now it's come true.

27:10.845 --> 27:15.544
We were on a winter nature hike
identifying perennials, moss.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.914
One of the boys found a sick bat
and brought it to the van...

27:19.087 --> 27:21.317
...and started passing it around.

27:21.489 --> 27:24.925
- Did they get scratched or bitten?
- Maybe, we don't know.

27:25.093 --> 27:29.792
Their stories changed when they
found out they're going to get a shot.

27:29.964 --> 27:34.594
- Let's see if the bat's rabid.
- We don't have a bat.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.796
- I threw it out the car window.
- I'll start some charts.

27:39.808 --> 27:43.744
- It was flopping, drooling.
- And you panicked.

27:43.945 --> 27:46.004
Yes, I suppose I did.

27:49.551 --> 27:52.714
- Anyone seen Randi?
- Went for a sandwich.

27:52.887 --> 27:54.787
This must be a mistake.

27:54.956 --> 28:00.553
"All ER nurses will be exempt
from the floatation schedule."

28:00.729 --> 28:04.096
- What about my honeymoon?
- You must be dreaming, girl.

28:04.232 --> 28:07.395
What did you say to them?
No more floating.

28:07.569 --> 28:12.871
- You must be kidding!
- No wonder management wanted you.

28:13.074 --> 28:16.669
Paramedics! Got a live one coming in.

28:16.878 --> 28:21.144
Bring these to Doug. Order a series of
RIG and rabies vaccines.

28:21.316 --> 28:22.578
- How many?
- Nine.

28:23.318 --> 28:25.445
- What happened?
- 10-year-old male.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.748
BP 100 over 70.
Throat pain with bleeding.

28:28.923 --> 28:33.917
He tried to be a sword swallower.
He tried with a carving knife.

28:34.095 --> 28:36.723
Get him into Trauma 1.
Who's covering Surgery?

28:36.898 --> 28:41.426
- Gant, but he's in Radiology.
- You have to wait out here.

28:45.373 --> 28:50.504
Dr. Keaton, I see you have a
trisegmentectomy for a heptoblastoma.

28:50.712 --> 28:53.943
No, the child needs
a course of pre-op chemo.

28:54.115 --> 28:57.778
- It's on the board.
- It shouldn't be. I canceled it.

28:57.952 --> 29:02.651
You were unlucky today, but you've
seen a lot in a single rotation.

29:02.824 --> 29:07.193
If I get more experience, I'll be
better prepared for the future.

29:07.362 --> 29:11.662
That's not how you should
be looking at it.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.360
- What do you mean?
- Focus on what's in front of you.

29:14.536 --> 29:20.941
Your Residency is five years long.
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

29:22.143 --> 29:25.135
I feel crepitation.
He's got subcutaneous air in his neck.

29:25.346 --> 29:27.576
Probably perfed his esophagus.

29:27.749 --> 29:30.479
- You want a chest film?
- And a soft tissue neck.

29:30.652 --> 29:33.314
- Probable perforation.
- Temp's 100.

29:33.488 --> 29:37.356
Get a gram of Unasyn.
Are you going to scope him?

29:38.326 --> 29:43.457
- I wouldn't, he's perfed.
- Carol, set up for an endoscopy.

29:48.102 --> 29:50.798
<i>- Medica</i>/ <i>Records.</i>
- This is Jeanie Boulet.

29:50.972 --> 29:57.241
I'd like to know if anyone inquired
about my file today.

29:57.412 --> 30:01.109
Around noon? All right, thank you.

30:02.484 --> 30:06.215
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

30:07.388 --> 30:11.381
- It's so damned swollen in here.
- Can you visualize the cords?

30:11.559 --> 30:16.690
- What have we got?
- Boy trying to be a sword swallower.

30:16.865 --> 30:19.493
Vitals are stable.
Gave him a gram of Unasyn.

30:19.634 --> 30:22.967
We're trying to see if there's a perf.

30:23.137 --> 30:27.574
- Carter, isn't Gant covering the ER?
- Gant's jammed. I paged Carter.

30:27.775 --> 30:31.609
The kid is slow, and we don't help him
by picking up his slack.

30:31.779 --> 30:34.839
- The patient is more important.
- Carol made the right call.

30:35.016 --> 30:38.747
They're Peter's interns.
It's his decision.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.219
- He's perfed his esophagus.
- We all knew that one.

30:42.891 --> 30:45.758
- Should I drop an NG?
- No, we'll do that in the O.R.

30:45.927 --> 30:49.363
- I'll page Dr. Keaton.
- Stay here and help your friend.

30:57.839 --> 31:02.276
All right. Next time you see a bat,
what are you going to do?

31:02.443 --> 31:04.809
Leave it alone!

31:04.979 --> 31:07.243
Good! Now hop out of the way.

31:07.415 --> 31:09.440
Let's send instructions
home with them.

31:09.617 --> 31:14.884
We'll follow up injections
on days 3, 7, 14 and 28.

31:15.056 --> 31:19.959
- Mr. Wilbourne, time for your shot.
- I barely touched the thing.

31:20.128 --> 31:24.224
- Rabies is not to fool around with.
- Can we watch?

31:26.734 --> 31:29.328
Mark, do you have a minute?

31:29.504 --> 31:33.372
I wanted to talk about the memo
about floating the nurses.

31:33.575 --> 31:37.170
- You have to handle it yourself.
- I am handling it.

31:37.378 --> 31:39.312
- You want me to put a word in?
- No.

31:39.514 --> 31:43.848
I'd like one 24-hour period where
no one complains about their job.

31:44.018 --> 31:47.749
One person could appreciate
the fact that they have one.

31:47.922 --> 31:54.452
They agreed to my request and are
going to stop floating the nurses.

31:55.263 --> 31:58.357
I thought you might want
some good news.

32:03.972 --> 32:07.703
Poor kid. Trying to swallow a knife.

32:07.909 --> 32:12.141
I've seen worse.
Mobilize the esophagus.

32:12.313 --> 32:15.043
D Ábride the wound.

32:16.384 --> 32:20.150
Okay. And... I'm there.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.616
Dr. Keaton.

32:27.428 --> 32:29.692
- I need to ask you something.
- Suction.

32:29.864 --> 32:35.825
I'm a little concerned
about how Carter's doing.

32:37.105 --> 32:42.475
- How do you think he's doing?
- He had to scramble this rotation.

32:42.644 --> 32:46.080
We both did, but...

32:46.280 --> 32:49.215
- I think he's doing fine.
- So do I.

32:51.386 --> 32:56.414
He had a rough bit in the beginning,
but he listened. He learned.

32:57.325 --> 33:01.318
- He's very, very good with kids.
- Yes, he is.

33:01.496 --> 33:04.590
If that's the way
you feel about Carter, tell him.

33:04.732 --> 33:09.192
It's important for the teacher
to keep his intern informed.

33:09.370 --> 33:11.668
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

33:11.873 --> 33:16.037
That way he knows he's on the right
track. It's easy to get discouraged.

33:16.244 --> 33:20.510
I... yeah, I agree. I, yeah, agree.

33:24.285 --> 33:27.083
- It looks like snow.
- It smells like snow.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.747
- What does that mean?
- You can smell snow coming.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.361
- It smells like burritos.
- What are we going to do about Mark?

33:34.529 --> 33:39.364
- Put him on a plane or kill him.
- Maybe you should talk to him.

33:39.500 --> 33:44.199
I talked to him once.
To ask him again would be weird.

33:44.372 --> 33:49.810
Oh, you'd be violating the guy code.
Of noncommunication.

33:49.977 --> 33:54.175
- Don't you have a test to study for?
- You can't let him self-destruct.

33:54.348 --> 33:59.786
Let him get it out of his system. He
acts like a jerk, and then he's back.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.888
But will he have any friends left?

34:02.056 --> 34:05.617
- Didn't you get more morphine?
- He never came back.

34:05.793 --> 34:09.456
- Dr. Greene?
- I don't remember. I can't take it.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.155
- I know. Okay.
- Jeanie.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.268
What are you doing in here?

34:15.103 --> 34:19.938
Can I speak to you? I'm treating
a patient that you've neglected.

34:20.141 --> 34:24.840
- Go to the area I've assigned.
- So you make the rules?

34:25.012 --> 34:28.311
And you break them
by going into my file.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.918
I requested that information
under the Spousal Report Law.

34:32.085 --> 34:35.487
You wanted to know,
and you found out. It was unethical.

34:35.656 --> 34:39.683
- You were lying to me.
- I guess the truth is out now.

34:39.860 --> 34:43.353
- You should have come to me.
- So I could lose my job sooner?

34:43.531 --> 34:47.558
So I could have dealt
with the situation appropriately.

34:47.702 --> 34:49.329
No, it's better this way.

34:49.504 --> 34:53.270
You know about me, and I know
a hell of a lot more about you.

34:55.810 --> 34:58.472
Excuse me,
I have to attend to a patient.

35:11.793 --> 35:16.162
- It's not the flu. It's allergies.
- I didn't say a thing.

35:16.330 --> 35:17.695
- I'm gone.
- Break a leg!

35:17.832 --> 35:22.326
- We're going to celebrate.
- It's happy hour. No more floating.

35:22.503 --> 35:26.166
- First pitcher of margaritas is on us.
- I can't. I have an appointment.

35:26.374 --> 35:30.640
- What can be that important?
- You're our guest of honor.

35:41.789 --> 35:45.691
Hey, are you done?

35:45.860 --> 35:49.762
- Benton just ripped me a new one.
- About what?

35:49.931 --> 35:54.231
Not being in Trauma
for the perfed esophagus.

35:54.368 --> 35:58.031
- Why didn't you come and get me?
- They paged me.

35:59.907 --> 36:04.310
I know you're trying to help,
but you didn't. You made it worse.

36:05.813 --> 36:07.474
I'm sorry.

36:09.283 --> 36:12.741
The best thing you can do
is to leave me alone.

36:27.535 --> 36:30.732
- Anything good?
- Just surfing.

36:30.905 --> 36:33.738
- Done for the day?
- Almost.

36:33.941 --> 36:37.035
- AI, about this afternoon...
- It's okay.

36:37.245 --> 36:41.545
I'm sorry that I
jumped to conclusions. It's just...

36:41.716 --> 36:45.812
I get up every morning wondering
how it's going to get worse.

36:46.554 --> 36:49.990
- What I'm going to do to ruin your life?
- No.

36:50.157 --> 36:52.921
Yeah. Maybe.

36:55.229 --> 36:58.426
I do want to blame you.

36:58.566 --> 37:02.593
I know things happen for
no good reason. I see it every day...

37:02.770 --> 37:07.264
...but when it's happening to you,
you want it to be somebody's fault.

37:08.276 --> 37:12.542
I haven't told anybody at work.

37:12.713 --> 37:17.582
I still play poker on Tuesdays,
shoot hoops on Saturdays.

37:17.752 --> 37:19.811
Some guys I could tell,
some I couldn't.

37:22.523 --> 37:24.286
But...

37:26.527 --> 37:29.121
None of them
would treat me the same again.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.399
You don't deserve this.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.673
Neither do you.

37:53.154 --> 37:57.750
What's in store for tonight?
Karate class, a couple of laps?

37:57.925 --> 38:01.725
Actually, my goal is to stay awake
til the 10:00 news.

38:01.896 --> 38:08.096
- How's Susan's apartment working?
- I'm never there.

38:08.235 --> 38:13.070
Look, I'm sorry. Today I was...
What was I today?

38:13.274 --> 38:16.209
Vicious, humorless, pain in the ass.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.778
- You want to talk?
- I want to sleep.

38:19.947 --> 38:23.781
Nothing's the same.
It's just not fun in there anymore.

38:23.951 --> 38:28.285
- It was fun once?
- You know what I mean. Sometimes...

38:28.456 --> 38:32.187
...I'm up to my ears
in administrative problems.

38:32.360 --> 38:37.229
Kerry Weaver and I
are constantly butting heads.

38:37.365 --> 38:42.393
The whole staff is lying to me.
I used to think of this as a family.

38:42.570 --> 38:47.598
You've got to remember that my idea
of a family is a little screwed up.

38:47.808 --> 38:52.802
- It's okay to miss her.
- No, it's more than that.

38:53.014 --> 38:56.381
Whatever you do,
you should keep it separate.

38:56.550 --> 39:00.680
My mom used to work in an office,
and she never put a picture of me out.

39:00.855 --> 39:06.725
She said, "Never confuse
where you work with where you live."

39:06.894 --> 39:09.021
She didn't work in the ER.

39:09.196 --> 39:14.031
I just shared with you
a profound childhood moment.

39:14.168 --> 39:19.367
It's moving, and your mother
is a very wise woman.

39:19.573 --> 39:22.508
I can't face another frozen dinner.
Do you want to get a burger?

39:22.676 --> 39:26.840
I can't, but if you want to talk,
you know where I'll be.

39:27.014 --> 39:33.180
- I don't know where you are.
- At home after 10. Alone.

39:48.702 --> 39:52.763
Dr. Benton, hi. How was the surgery?

39:52.973 --> 39:57.342
I missed a thyroglossal duct, but
a perfed esophagus fell into my lap.

39:57.511 --> 40:00.036
Good. Great.

40:00.247 --> 40:03.182
I wanted to talk to you
about your work.

40:03.384 --> 40:07.616
I know I don't usually give you
a lot of feedback...

40:07.788 --> 40:12.521
...but the fact is,
you're doing good work.

40:12.693 --> 40:19.394
Your work has improved.
You're more confident and proactive.

40:20.568 --> 40:26.404
There are areas
that need improvement, like focus.

40:28.442 --> 40:33.209
- What?
- Focus, Carter. Focus.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.747
Anyway, we'll work on that.

40:36.917 --> 40:40.910
I just wanted to tell you
that you're doing good work.

40:42.156 --> 40:45.990
Listen, I've got to run.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.220
- All right. Good night, Carter.
- Good night.

40:53.200 --> 40:57.967
- Hi.
- You just missed Benton by a second.

40:58.139 --> 41:00.733
I saw him. I slowed to a stroll.

41:02.343 --> 41:05.278
- I can hardly breathe.
- It's okay.

41:12.019 --> 41:14.146
Jeanie.

41:20.161 --> 41:23.892
- About today...
- Mark Greene looked in my file.

41:24.031 --> 41:31.335
Anspaugh has set a time for Mark
and I to discuss hospital policy.

41:31.505 --> 41:35.532
- It'll remain confidential.
- I don't put much faith in that.

41:35.743 --> 41:39.372
Maybe it's not going to be so bad.
You're dealing with doctors.

41:39.547 --> 41:44.746
There's some understanding about the
disease and how it's transmitted.

41:44.919 --> 41:48.082
Right. Right.

41:50.491 --> 41:54.928
Well, you know what? I'm starving.

41:55.095 --> 42:00.533
The aroma coming from
the cafeteria isn't too scary.

42:00.668 --> 42:03.432
You want to join me?

42:07.541 --> 42:09.941
- Well?
- What are you doing here?

42:10.110 --> 42:13.671
I'm invested in this exam,
I helped you study. How'd you do?

42:13.881 --> 42:16.441
- Pretty good. I think we got lucky.
- Luck nothing.

42:16.617 --> 42:21.384
You earned yourself a night out.
A couple of Manhattans...

42:21.555 --> 42:25.821
- What was the fireman question?
- 35 newtons.

42:25.993 --> 42:28.757
- You remember William?
- How are you doing?

42:28.929 --> 42:32.490
- The entropy question?
- Rudolf Clausius.

42:32.633 --> 42:36.626
I'm starved.
Anybody feel like ice cream?

42:36.804 --> 42:39.170
Lead the way, William.

42:46.013 --> 42:47.878
- You all right?
- Yes.

42:48.048 --> 42:51.643
- Thanks for bringing the extra boots.
- They're a little big.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.946
Just three or four sizes.

42:54.121 --> 42:57.921
- You want to carry the ax?
- No, thank you.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.888
What are we looking for?

43:01.061 --> 43:06.021
A Douglas fir with prefect branches
and a very thin trunk.

43:06.166 --> 43:10.034
- Is this legal? Who's land is it?
- It's our land.

43:10.804 --> 43:14.865
- As in "public land"?
- As in...

43:15.075 --> 43:19.273
See that lake through those trees?
The smoke coming out of the chimney?

43:19.446 --> 43:21.641
No.

43:21.815 --> 43:28.687
Right there. No? Well, it's there,
and it's the house I grew up in.

43:28.856 --> 43:31.324
Tell me we're not having cocoa
with your parents.

43:31.492 --> 43:35.053
No, you're safe. They're in London.

43:35.229 --> 43:40.531
Look! Look! It's the perfect tree.
All right, stand back.

43:40.668 --> 43:44.695
- I have a lumberjack fantasy.
- This is a sacred tradition.

43:44.872 --> 43:48.603
Oh, it's a sacred fantasy.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.906
Let me turn you into a little snowman.

43:56.083 --> 44:00.383
Don't you dare.
It's not part of the fantasy.
