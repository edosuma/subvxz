13:25.304 --> 13:26.972

the momentum that we have.
-Okay,

13:38.609 --> 13:40.069
but I actually do need to go.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.279

I got real responsibilities.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.239
Girl, I got a whole child.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.492
Rent due, and I need
to make some money. So,

13:46.575 --> 13:48.118

13:48.202 --> 13:51.372
-but I don't got
no time to be wasting, so...

14:11.684 --> 14:14.353
Do you wanna cook us
something to blow off steam?

14:14.436 --> 14:16.730
Shawna:
I tore up my whole closet
trying to make a studio for us.

14:16.814 --> 14:17.773
I spent all my money
on a new microphone,

14:17.856 --> 14:21.443
and she came and shit
on everything! Fuck.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.571
You spent money on a new mic?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.489
Yeah. Yeah. I was pretty sure
I told you that.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.909
No, you didn't, but noted.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.869
I just feel like I can never
get on the same page with her.

14:30.953 --> 14:31.996
You know what I mean? Like...

14:32.079 --> 14:34.623
I don't know. I haven't done
a collab like this

14:34.707 --> 14:37.251
-since you know who.
-Yeah, but (sighs)...

14:37.334 --> 14:39.003
I thought the whole point
of your music was to,

14:39.086 --> 14:40.671
-like, say something meaningful.
-It is.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.382
Then what are you doing?
You know,

14:43.465 --> 14:44.508
once, once you sing
with a girl like that,

14:44.592 --> 14:46.844
you know that's how people
are gonna see you, right?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.596
Okay, yeah,
and you know I'm the one

14:48.679 --> 14:50.806
that asked her to be
in a group with me.

14:50.889 --> 14:53.267
She has a really
loyal following.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.394
Yeah 'cause she does porn.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.813
What are you talking about?
She doesn't do porn.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.983
I saw her OnlyFans,
Shawna,

15:01.066 --> 15:04.361
and it is basically porn.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.031
Okay. And?

15:07.114 --> 15:09.825
And I'm trying to look
after your future.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.412
I don't like how
you're talking right now.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.874
This is the opposite of
everything you stand for.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.959
