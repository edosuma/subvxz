couple hours...
Ooh, what is this?

09:08.467 --> 09:10.200
Those paintings.

to put them. I don't know.

make those?

Vandelay.

your "friend."

It's an artist that I know.

though.

Wow.

about.

have to tell Kris about the

09:39.600 --> 09:42.633
prank soon, because she's, she's
trying to get them appraised.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.133
This isn't gonna go well.

We do have to break it
to her that we're completely

09:46.367 --> 09:48.100
lying, art-shaming her...

placeholders.

again.

Ryan in the mix.

would feel the same way.

We really just got to figure out
when to break the news to her.

be actually mad at us for this.

Kris is going to react, but I'm

>> KRIS: She doesn't wear

17:27.367 --> 17:29.367
handbags, she doesn't wear
jewelry.

17:29.367 --> 17:33.100
She barely wears clothes.
>> KIM (chuckles): Yeah.

17:33.100 --> 17:36.200
>> KRIS: Do you think you'll
ever shave again?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.667
>> SCOTT: Mm-mm.
>> KRIS: So, do you think that

17:37.667 --> 17:40.367
the last time you had a clean-
shaven face when we were

17:40.367 --> 17:43.233
together with you, that was the
last time we'll ever see Scott

17:43.233 --> 17:47.400
Disick, the Lord, Lord Disick?
>> SCOTT: Yeah. I don't know,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.600
but Mason told me he doesn't
like...

17:49.600 --> 17:51.500
I show him pictures of it
shaved, and he's like, "No!

17:51.500 --> 17:53.467
I can't look at you, Dad, I
can't!"

17:53.467 --> 17:55.333
>> KRIS: What?
>> SCOTT: Mm-hmm.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.333
>> KIM: Yeah, sometimes when you
have something so stuck in your

17:57.333 --> 17:59.333
mind in what you're used to...
>> SCOTT: And Penelope wants me

17:59.333 --> 18:01.367
to grow it long.
Like a Santa Claus.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.533
>> KRIS: Of course she does.
>> SCOTT: I just want to look

18:03.533 --> 18:05.533
like a bum.
And then hop out of, like, a

18:05.533 --> 18:07.533
Lamborghini.
Really throw people off.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.400
>> KRIS: That's your goal in
life?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
>> SCOTT: Pretty much.
>> KRIS: Those are good

18:11.400 --> 18:13.400
aspirations.
>> SCOTT: By the way, do you

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
want to come with me and Khlo
tomorrow to lunch? At Nobu?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.266
With that guy Art?
Weren't you, like, telling me

18:17.266 --> 18:18.667
you were, like, dying to meet
the guy?

18:18.667 --> 18:20.767
>> KIM: Yeah. I'm just trying to
think of what I'm doing

18:20.767 --> 18:22.767

18:22.767 --> 18:24.767
like, 1:00, I think.
>> KIM: I'll have to check my

18:24.767 --> 18:26.667
schedule.
>> KRIS: I need a really big

18:26.667 --> 18:30.400
piece of art for my dining room.
>> SCOTT: You want to come?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.400
>> KRIS: Sure.
>> SCOTT: Cool. We would love to

18:32.400 --> 18:34.433
have you there.
>> KRIS: Thank you.

18:34.433 --> 18:38.266

Daytime drinking is always a

18:38.266 --> 18:41.667
plus, so we're all gonna go to
lunch and... tell her.

them start talking, and then be

18:44.433 --> 18:46.300

>> SCOTT: Right.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.567

18:49.567 --> 18:51.533

end.

painting, our late nights.

given them alcohol and they all

25:39.600 --> 25:42.000
>> RICHARDSON: I've never...
I know virtually nothing about

25:42.000 --> 25:45.533
art.
Yeah. I don't... It's true.

25:45.533 --> 25:50.233
>> KRIS: What?
You guys are such pieces of

25:50.233 --> 25:56.500
(bleep)!
>> SCOTT: (laughs) "Oh, my God!

25:56.500 --> 25:59.200
You had me!
Ah!"

25:59.200 --> 26:01.467
(Khloe laughing)
It's like watching, you know,

26:01.467 --> 26:04.533
one of those, like, bad daytime
dramas.

26:04.533 --> 26:06.467
episodes?
>> SCOTT: No, it wasn't.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.066
(Khloe mimics rimshot)
>> SCOTT: Pow!

26:08.066 --> 26:10.066
>> KRIS: Kim even said to me
Kanye's interested in your art.

26:10.066 --> 26:11.734
>> SCOTT: Oh, yeah, she was in
on it.

26:11.734 --> 26:13.667
>> RICHARDSON: If Kanye would
love to buy art from me, I'll

26:13.667 --> 26:15.500
start making some.
>> SCOTT: By the way, Matthew

26:15.500 --> 26:17.133
was in on it, too.
>> KRIS: What?

26:17.133 --> 26:20.233
No wonder my designers made me
put it in MJ's room.

26:20.233 --> 26:22.233
>> KHLOE: Chrissy was in on it.
>> KRIS: Stop.

26:22.233 --> 26:24.100
>> SCOTT: Everybody knows.
>> KRIS: Stop it.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.500
>> SCOTT: You just got shamed.
(Richardson laughs)

26:26.500 --> 26:30.633
>> KRIS: You guys, I can't even
be mad, because this is so good.

26:30.633 --> 26:33.667
Like, I would-- I would be proud
of myself if I could pull this

26:33.667 --> 26:36.033
off.
Yay, Khloe and Scott.

26:36.033 --> 26:37.767
>> RICHARDSON: Well done.
>> SCOTT: And Art.

26:37.767 --> 26:40.767
>> KRIS: You had me this time.
This one, I didn't see this

26:40.767 --> 26:44.500
coming.
And that's what makes me so mad,

26:44.500 --> 26:47.100
is that I know it's gonna happen
again.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.133
>> SCOTT: It sure is.
>> KRIS: I don't even know if

26:49.133 --> 26:51.633
I'm being pranked right now.
Like, is Art Vandelay really

26:51.633 --> 26:54.000
real?
And you're, like, trying to

26:54.000 --> 26:57.567
reverse psychology?
>> RICHARDSON: Cheers to you.

26:57.567 --> 26:59.166
>> KRIS: Yeah.
>> RICHARDSON: Aw, cheers to

26:59.166 --> 27:00.767
you.
>> SCOTT: L'chaim.

27:00.767 --> 27:02.633
>> KHLOE: L'chaim.
>> SCOTT: Like they say in the

27:02.633 --> 27:06.200
old country.
(Khloe yipping)

27:06.200 --> 27:08.133
>> KHLOE: Like they say in
Armenia.

27:08.133 --> 27:09.667
>> SCOTT: (laughs) I think
that's Mexico.

27:09.667 --> 27:12.266
>> KRIS: Scott...
>> KHLOE: Whatever.

27:12.266 --> 27:14.533
♪

27:23.266 --> 27:25.300
>> KRIS: What's going on here,
guys?

27:25.300 --> 27:27.133
>> JUSTIN: Yeah, we're just
gonna have fun.

27:27.133 --> 27:29.000
Show you a little bit of what
we've been up to.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.667
>> KRIS: Yes.
>> JUSTIN: Corey, this is my

27:30.667 --> 27:33.000
friend Noah.
>> NOAH: What's up, man? Noah.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.700
>> KRIS: Hi. How are you?
I'm so excited.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.567
>> JUSTIN: We've never had a
basketball court outdoor in this

27:40.567 --> 27:42.667
area of Watts.
>> KRIS: I'm so impressed.

27:42.667 --> 27:45.166
>> JUSTIN: Yeah.
>> KRIS: This is so fantastic.

27:45.166 --> 27:48.166
>> JUSTIN: Years and years ago,
uh, they had some stuff over

27:48.166 --> 27:50.567
here, but we were like, "Let's
put it on the backside."

27:50.567 --> 27:53.567
So, with drive-bys and so forth
at nighttime, that they're

27:53.567 --> 27:56.567
protected by the building, it's
not a target, and it's like--

27:56.567 --> 27:59.300
but let's do it actually proper.
So it's, honestly, a full

27:59.300 --> 28:01.200
basketball court.
>> KRIS: Stop.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.767
>> TAUNA: They're doing, um, the
rebar up and everything that

28:03.767 --> 28:06.200
goes down and then the cement.
And then we'll come in and paint

28:06.200 --> 28:08.734
lines and put the hoops up.
They've been working around the

28:08.734 --> 28:14.200
clock, so...
>> KRIS: Amazing.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.567
I've reached out to a few
companies, asking for help with

28:17.567 --> 28:22.033
the kitchen renovation and the
gym renovation, the basketball

28:22.033 --> 28:24.300
court.
A lot of people have already

28:24.300 --> 28:28.400
chipped in and donated.
>> TAUNA: For Adidas, our belief

28:28.400 --> 28:30.734
is that, through sport, we have
the power to change lives.

28:30.734 --> 28:33.200
And we feel like creating safe
places to play for kids is

28:33.200 --> 28:35.400
life-changing.
>> KRIS: Adidas has been

28:35.400 --> 28:38.633
amazing, because they've agreed
to do the entire outdoor play

28:38.633 --> 28:41.200
area.
And other companies are doing

28:41.200 --> 28:43.734
the inside.
I'm so impressed.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.600
>> JUSTIN: Yeah.
>> KRIS: Getting the concrete

28:45.600 --> 28:50.266
poured for the future basketball
court is my dream come true for

28:50.266 --> 28:53.066
them.
Who owns these buildings?

28:53.066 --> 28:55.233
>> JUSTIN: It's government
subsidized housing, so it's the

28:55.233 --> 28:57.133
Housing Authority of Los
Angeles.

28:57.133 --> 28:59.767
Uh, so, yeah, it's, like, the
second largest in all of

28:59.767 --> 29:02.367
America.
New York and then here.

29:02.367 --> 29:04.667
>> KRIS: I'm really excited
about all the progress that's

29:04.667 --> 29:07.200
being made, and I'm so
optimistic that this is going to

29:07.200 --> 29:08.767
make the community a better
place.

29:08.767 --> 29:10.400
Hi.
>> BRUNO: How are you?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.233
I'm Bruno Marchesi.
>> KRIS: Kris. Nice to see you.

29:12.233 --> 29:14.100
>> BRUNO: Very nice to meet you.
>> KRIS: Thank you so much for

29:14.100 --> 29:15.767
being a part of this.
>> BRUNO: No, thank you.

29:15.767 --> 29:17.700
>> KRIS: It's so amazing.
>> BRUNO: It's about giving kids

29:17.700 --> 29:19.700
safe places to play...
>> KRIS: Right?

29:19.700 --> 29:21.367
>> BRUNO: ...and the opportunity
to be successful.

29:21.367 --> 29:23.166
That's what it's about.

29:25.367 --> 29:28.100
>> JUSTIN: Kids, they honestly
think they're born and are gonna

29:28.100 --> 29:31.166
die here.
We had one person, uh, that was

29:31.166 --> 29:35.433
shot and killed, uh, one block
away, uh, two weeks ago.

29:35.433 --> 29:39.367
And then, last week, uh, maybe
12 blocks away, there was two

29:39.367 --> 29:42.433
people shot and killed and six,
uh-- no, six shot and two

29:42.433 --> 29:48.633
killed.
>> SISTA: Some of our kids in

29:48.633 --> 29:52.200
our community, either their
father in prison or deceased.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.266
I lost two kids in 60 days.
>> KRIS: Oh, my God.

29:55.266 --> 29:57.266
>> SISTA: That's how I met
Justin.

29:57.266 --> 29:59.667
This is a dream.
Whatever we wanted, you did it.

29:59.667 --> 30:03.266
And I just want to say thank you
for everything and working hard

30:03.266 --> 30:07.000
with Yang and his staff and
with Red Eye.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.066
>> KRIS: We're so proud to be a
part of this, so thank you for

30:10.066 --> 30:12.266
allowing us to be a part of your
family.

30:12.266 --> 30:15.700
All the things that are
happening are going to be really

30:15.700 --> 30:19.200
terrific for the kids.
The ability to come someplace

30:19.200 --> 30:22.133
and have a really safe
environment with really loving

30:22.133 --> 30:27.000
people can make a big difference
in a community that's otherwise

30:27.000 --> 30:31.166
going to be left behind.
>> KRIS: See you.

30:31.166 --> 30:34.033
(Kris laughs)
>> KHLOE: The opposing team is

30:34.033 --> 30:36.033
here.
>> KOURTNEY: Hey, Papa T.

30:36.033 --> 30:38.033
>> TITO: Hey, babe.
>> KOURTNEY: How are you?

30:38.033 --> 30:39.500
>> TITO: All right, sweetheart.
How are you?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.433
>> KOURTNEY: Good. So good to
see you.

30:41.433 --> 30:44.033
>> KHLOE: Hello.
>> KRIS: Hey, everybody, listen

30:44.033 --> 30:46.467
up.
Alex Rodriguez.

30:46.467 --> 30:49.033
>> KIM: My mom really pulled it
together.

30:49.033 --> 30:52.700
I think we have a real shot
here.

30:52.700 --> 30:58.233
(screams)
>> CROWD: Three, two, one!

30:58.233 --> 31:01.233
(all cheer)
>> KRIS: I can't wait to see all

31:01.233 --> 31:03.233
the hard work that was put into
the center.

31:03.233 --> 31:05.200
>> JUSTIN: They wouldn't even
let me see in here 'cause they

31:05.200 --> 31:07.233
wanted me to be surprised.
What the...? Whoa!

31:07.233 --> 31:08.133
>> KRIS: Oh, my God.

31:12.033 --> 31:16.133
>> KHLOE: It's game time, kids.
>> KRIS: Let's play ball.

31:16.133 --> 31:19.367
>> KHLOE: Hey, you guys.
>> COREY: Fired up today.

31:19.367 --> 31:23.567
>> KHLOE: We came up with the
name Calabasas Peaches because,

31:23.567 --> 31:28.333
A League of Their Own.
The opposing team is here.

31:28.333 --> 31:30.467
(Jonathan laughs)
Hi, how are you?

31:30.467 --> 31:32.467
>> TITO: You know Andrew.
>> KHLOE: How are you?

31:32.467 --> 31:34.400
>> ANDREW: Oh, you look good.
>> KHLOE: Oh, thank you.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.233
I'm not playing, but...
>> ANDREW: Look at you.

31:36.233 --> 31:38.133
>> KHLOE: I'm here for support.
>> KOURTNEY: Hey, Papa T.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.467
>> TITO: Hey, babe.
>> KOURTNEY: How are you?

31:39.467 --> 31:41.467
>> TITO: All right, sweetheart.
How are you?

31:41.467 --> 31:43.266
>> KOURTNEY: Good. So good to
see you.

31:43.266 --> 31:46.100
>> KHLOE: Hello. How are you?
>> TITO: I'm okay.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.066
>> KOURTNEY: Mom, are you
playing, or are you...?

31:48.066 --> 31:50.100
>> KRIS: No. I brought my secret
weapon.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.233
He's gonna be pulling up in
about five minutes.

31:52.233 --> 31:56.266
We still don't have a full team,
even after the second practice.

31:56.266 --> 32:00.367
So I've recruited a few more
people to round out this squad.

32:00.367 --> 32:03.367
But I still have one little
trick up my sleeve.

32:03.367 --> 32:06.000
On the field, guys.
Right now, please.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.133
And just stay there until you
hear from me later.

32:08.133 --> 32:10.100
>> JONATHAN: What is she so
excited about?

32:10.100 --> 32:12.000
>> LISA: We're waiting for
someone.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.533
>> KRIS: Where is he?
Is he coming?

32:13.533 --> 32:15.367
>> JONATHAN: What's the
surprise?

32:15.367 --> 32:18.266
>> KRIS: My ace in the hole.
Yay.

32:18.266 --> 32:21.033
Thank you, God.
Oh, my God.

32:21.033 --> 32:23.033
>> ALEX: What's up, baby?
>> KRIS: I'm so happy to see

32:23.033 --> 32:24.500
you.
>> ALEX: How are you, honey?

32:24.500 --> 32:26.500
Good to see you.
>> KRIS: Thank you.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.400
I know you're busy.
>> ALEX: No worries.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.367
>> KRIS: And you're trying to
run your empire from the road,

32:30.367 --> 32:32.367
but I am...
>> ALEX: You look great.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.233
>> KRIS: Thank you.
>> ALEX: I love the uni. Yeah.

32:34.233 --> 32:36.166
>> KRIS: Look.
>> ALEX: Looking sharp.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.066
Looking sharp.
>> KRIS: Professional shoes.

32:38.066 --> 32:41.300
>> JONATHAN: What?
>> KRIS: Hey, everybody.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.533
Listen up.
Alex Rodriguez.

32:44.533 --> 32:48.300
A-Rod is here to be our coach.
>> TJ: A-Rod? No!

32:48.300 --> 32:53.300
>> KRIS: Take that, Jacksons.
Yeah. He is here to help coach

32:53.300 --> 32:57.166
the girls today and bring in the
win for the Calabasas Peaches.

32:57.166 --> 33:00.200
Bam!
All right, so, Alex is here to

33:00.200 --> 33:02.467
give us a little motivation,
inspiration.

33:02.467 --> 33:04.400
He's the most amazing
motivational speaker.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.266
>> ALEX: Wow.
>> KRIS: He does this all over

33:06.266 --> 33:08.133
the world.
>> ALEX: I want you to focus on

33:08.133 --> 33:10.066
two things, 'cause we need to
win this game.

33:10.066 --> 33:12.266
The Jacksons have to go down,
okay?

33:12.266 --> 33:14.200
>> KRIS: That's right, yeah!
(all cheering)

33:14.200 --> 33:16.300
>> ALEX: So, two things.
Number one thing I want you to

33:16.300 --> 33:20.433
focus on-- very simple-- look at
the baseball and do not stop

33:20.433 --> 33:24.333
looking at the baseball.
Now, number two: I created this

33:24.333 --> 33:28.467
bat to hit home runs.
All you have to do is tap, tap,

33:28.467 --> 33:30.500
tap, tap.
(imitates explosion)

33:30.500 --> 33:32.433
And the ball will explode.
>> LISA: Got it. Got it.

33:32.433 --> 33:34.233
>> ALEX: See the ball and tap.
>> KHLOE: And have a little bit

33:34.233 --> 33:36.066
of fun.
>> ALEX: And have a little bit

33:36.066 --> 33:38.066
of fun.
>> KIM: Having Alex Rodriguez

33:38.066 --> 33:41.467
here is so major.
My mom really pulled it

33:41.467 --> 33:44.367
together.
I think we have a real shot

33:44.367 --> 33:47.333
here.
>> ALEX: Dear God, help us all

33:47.333 --> 33:50.166
play like New York Yankees.
(all laughing, cheering)

33:50.166 --> 33:52.367
>> KRIS: Yeah!
(whoops)

33:52.367 --> 33:56.433
>> JONATHAN: Good morning,
Calabasas, and welcome to the

33:56.433 --> 33:59.233
Southern California Baseball
Academy Field.

33:59.233 --> 34:02.734
It's the perfect weather for
today's family game between two

34:02.734 --> 34:08.266
equally fire teams: the
Calabasas Peaches and Tito's

34:08.266 --> 34:10.467
Team.
(all cheering)

34:10.467 --> 34:13.333
Guys, let's play some softball.
First at bat, TJ.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.367
>> KHLOE: Wait, so we're in
the field first?

34:15.367 --> 34:18.233
I thought we just sit.
I was gonna go eat.

34:18.233 --> 34:22.333
(all laugh)
>> LARSA: You suck!

34:22.333 --> 34:24.633
>> TJ: Yeah!
(Kim screams)

34:24.633 --> 34:26.633
>> KHLOE: Nice.
>> JONATHAN: Batting second,

34:26.633 --> 34:28.633
Royal.
Hit something hard.

34:28.633 --> 34:30.600
Oh, my God.
>> FRANCES: Yes!

34:30.600 --> 34:32.667
(Kim screams)
>> JONATHAN: Nice scream, Kim.

34:32.667 --> 34:37.066
Number 19, Dee Dee.
>> ANDREW: Let's go, Dee Dee!

34:37.066 --> 34:39.633
Ah! What?
>> TJ: Come on, Dee Dee, come

34:39.633 --> 34:42.166
on, you're running.
You got it, you got it.

34:42.166 --> 34:45.367
(all shouting)
>> KHLOE: Oh, I'm clapping for

34:45.367 --> 34:47.367
the wrong team.
>> JONATHAN: Yeah.

34:47.367 --> 34:52.400
Number 91, Louis up at bat.
>> KRIS: Oh, we're screwed.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.367
>> JONATHAN: Home run!
(all cheer)

34:55.367 --> 34:58.233
