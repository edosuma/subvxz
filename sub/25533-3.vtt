"I don't know
how you got the horse to do it.

00:43.793 --> 00:47.213
I don't know if you even should
get a horse to do this.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.052
Is it even legal in many places?"

Buenos Aires.
It just sounds romantic, doesn't it?

01:51.528 --> 01:56.991
It just has always been out there for me
as a place that I always wanted to go,

01:57.075 --> 01:58.409
I knew nothing about...

01:58.952 --> 02:01.162
but it always seemed elegant, you know?

02:01.246 --> 02:04.833
And my imagination is filled
with people tangoing in the streets,

02:04.916 --> 02:08.002
and I heard the meat was really good.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.757
And that's all I really needed
to motivate me to come here.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.386
You feel like you're in Europe
with the grand architecture,

02:16.928 --> 02:18.304
beautiful parks,

02:18.388 --> 02:22.016
these very mature trees
and they line the sidewalks

02:22.100 --> 02:23.476
and these wide avenues.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.771
All right, are you ready? We're going in.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.982
First stop: El Obrero.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.152
Kind of an Argentinian version of a diner.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.032
This is a traditional bodegón.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.284
Casual place.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.161
-Casual place.
-But with great food.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.289
-Great food. Food from the city, you know?
-Yeah.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.208
Soledad Nardelli is a world-class chef.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.085
This is one of her favorite places,

02:49.169 --> 02:51.754
and we're going to eat
what the people eat.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.716
Here in Buenos Aires,
we are all sons of immigrants.

02:54.799 --> 02:58.970
Like Spanish people, Italian people.
My surname is Nardelli--

02:59.053 --> 02:59.929
-Italy.
-[Soledad] Yes.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.807
[Phil] Soledad tells me
obrero means worker.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.226
[Soledad] Una tortilla. Spanish tortilla.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.273
[Phil] I think we're putting
our stomachs to work.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.400
This is your first time in Buenos Aires?

03:12.483 --> 03:14.611
-First time in South America.
-No!

03:14.694 --> 03:16.321
-Yeah.
-Oi.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.616
What was the first thing you had
in mind when you say Argentina?

03:19.699 --> 03:21.576
I don't know. The Pope?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.245
-Tango?
-Steak.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.664
I think we are much more than that.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.959
[Phil] Oh, I see what you mean.
Like fried calamari

03:30.126 --> 03:33.046
and this french fry thing
called revuelto gramajo.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.841
[Soledad] It's ham,
scrambled eggs, fried potatoes.

03:36.925 --> 03:37.759
Mm.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.803
I knew what it would taste like
by looking at it, and it's even better.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.974
This is a dish that you can only eat
in bodegones near the port.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.229
And the people who came were workers.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.480
They don't have lots of money.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.774
-[Soledad] So they--
-They don't have a lot of time.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.110
So they need to eat quick
and with calories.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.238
[Phil] What's my excuse?

03:58.321 --> 03:59.948
[chuckles]

04:00.031 --> 04:01.366
Panqueque de dulce leche.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.744
This is my favorite.
This is the dulce de leche pancake.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.664
[Phil] Which is just
the most beautiful way to say caramel.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.166
Sugar sprinkled on top

04:10.250 --> 04:13.211
and then,
because it's not quite delicious enough...

04:14.462 --> 04:15.380
ice cream on top.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.928
Ba-boom!

04:23.346 --> 04:24.389
[laughs]

04:25.682 --> 04:28.768
[making shooting noises]

04:28.851 --> 04:31.020
[makes explosion noises]

04:33.564 --> 04:35.650
[Phil] This is
the star of the show right here.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.152
-Panqueque de dulce leche.
-[Phil] Wow.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.114
-Yes, it's our identity--
-It's kind of a national dish--

04:41.197 --> 04:42.115
I was just gonna say.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.492
-Yes.
-[Phil] You say it's your identity.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.911
It's crispy and then soft inside.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.163
It's a dulce de leche crepe really.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.082
But we do it just a little bit thicker.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.250
[Phil] You call it pancake.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.751
Our one.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.920
-For you.
-[Phil] What?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.171
[Soledad chuckles]

04:57.255 --> 04:59.465
I can't put it in my suitcase.
Know what's gonna happen?

04:59.549 --> 05:02.760
I put it in my suitcase,
it opens, everything is destroyed.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.517
[Phil] The first Spanish explorers landed
here on the banks of the Río de la Plata

05:09.600 --> 05:10.643
in the 16th century.

05:11.185 --> 05:14.355
And European immigration
has fed this city ever since.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.774
Some 17 million people live here now

05:16.858 --> 05:20.611
and call themselves porteños,
which means people of the port.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.534
The international vibe is in full effect

05:26.617 --> 05:29.746
at Los Galgos,
a café known for its happy hour.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.207
This will be a good place to learn
some porteño pointers

05:33.458 --> 05:34.792
with the help of this guy.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.793
Rodolfo.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.296
Mixology expert Rodolfo Reich.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.006
You used to write about movies, right?

05:40.089 --> 05:42.467
Yeah, but that was
like 20 years ago maybe.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.509
You don't look that old.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.261
Alcohol is a very good preservative.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.555
-It helps pickle you.
-[Rodolfo chuckles]

05:47.638 --> 05:48.473
I'm like a pickle.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.766
-Like a pickle.
-How you say?

05:49.932 --> 05:52.393
[Phil] Julián! Nice to see you.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.311
Nice to see you.

05:53.394 --> 05:57.732
Julián Díaz took this old bar
that had fallen into disrepair.

05:57.815 --> 06:01.652
It's like an 80, 90-year-old bar,
and he restored it.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.072
We were just saying we love
what you did with the place.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.156
Oh, thank you very much.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.241
This bar is open
with coffee in the morning,

06:07.325 --> 06:08.993
and it goes all the way
late into the night.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.622
And this is a typical bar for porteños?

06:12.705 --> 06:15.458
-Yeah.
-But I love this idea of cocktails on tap.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.795
In Argentina, we love the negroni.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.048
[Phil] That's equal parts gin,
Campari, and sweet vermouth

06:22.131 --> 06:23.800
for those of you playing along at home.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.885
Ooh.

06:25.968 --> 06:26.844
[Rodolfo] It's strong.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.262
-That's fuerte.
-[Rodolfo chuckles]

06:29.806 --> 06:31.557
Today's not going to finish
very well for you.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.684
-[both chuckle]
-I'm sorry about that, but...

06:35.895 --> 06:38.606
Always for us, drink something
is eat something.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.565
A snack?

06:40.108 --> 06:42.276
[Phil] Yes, in Argentina,
this is just a snack.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.195
A big plate of marinated tongue

06:44.278 --> 06:47.156
and a slice of rolled stuffed flank steak
called matambre.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.827
All the food we're serving in Los Galgos
is Argentinian typical food.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.704
If you go to a Christmas,
you will find all this stuff.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.207
Here it's very hot in Christmas,
so this stuff--

06:56.290 --> 06:59.210
Right! You have hot Christmas
because we're upside down here.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.337
-[laughs]
-[Phil] Meaning I am upside down here.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.549
-[Rodolfo chuckles]
-[Phil] Mm.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.009
-Nice. You like it?
-I love it.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.553
[Julián] This is potato tortilla.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.097
Wow! This is just for happy hour?
This is just for--

07:11.180 --> 07:12.598
[Julián] Yes. Just for a start.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.476
Really? Why would you have
dinner afterwards? This is like...

07:15.560 --> 07:17.937
Because, in Buenos Aires,
you know, we have dinner very late.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.065
At home we have dinner at 9:00,
9:30, maybe ten o'clock.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.192
And then what time do you get up for work?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.861
Oh, the same as everybody, at 7:00.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.489
Yeah, if you go to dance,
you go at two o'clock in the morning.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.825
And you still get up at 7:00 for work?

07:30.908 --> 07:32.160
Yeah. And--

07:32.243 --> 07:35.455
-I don't understand you people.
-[Julián chuckles]

07:39.375 --> 07:41.002
[Phil] Now here's something I understand.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.296
But these aren't hot dogs,
they're chorizo.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.423
And to find out what porteños
do with them,

07:45.506 --> 07:48.509
I'm meeting expat food blogger Allie Lazar

07:48.593 --> 07:52.513
for an introduction to the most famous
local sandwich called choripán.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.309
Chori is chorizo, pan means bread.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.019
So choripán is chorizo on bread.

07:58.102 --> 08:01.606
And it's just probably
the quintessential Argentine street food.

08:01.689 --> 08:05.651
They eat it at barbeques,
they'll have it at soccer games.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.861
Usually it's made from pork,

08:06.944 --> 08:10.323
and the only condiment they generally
put on it is chimichurri sauce.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.533
Maybe sometime a little salsa criolla,

08:12.617 --> 08:16.537
which is the onion, tomato
in a vinegar sauce.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.039
And that's what it is.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.999
-This is fast food.
-This is a little different.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.668
This is one of the first places
that kind of wanted to give

08:22.752 --> 08:25.421
a little bit more of an elevation
to the chorizo sandwich.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.133
They make everything in-house, and they
want to kind of give it their own flair.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.927
[Phil] So this is the new Buenos Aires.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.386
-Places like this.
-[Allie] Exactly.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.180
-Cool twist on the classic, right?
-Right.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.266
By the way, what fast-food place
gives you gin and tonic?

08:37.808 --> 08:38.935
What do we have here?

08:39.018 --> 08:41.020
-[Phil] Speaking of-- Wow.
-[Allie] Wow.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.439
This is a classic choripán.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.400
Lettuce, tomato and some fried--

08:46.484 --> 08:48.736
[Phil] Fried onion! Mm.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.447
That's a very unique flavor. Oh, my God.

08:52.573 --> 08:57.703
[Allie] Let's do the smoked one.
Mushrooms, crisp lettuce, smoked chorizo.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.080
A lot of mayo. [chuckles]

08:59.580 --> 09:00.915
They like things drippy.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.961
Once an Argentine told me,
like, if it's not messy, it's not food.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.462
-This is food.
-[Allie] Right?

09:08.464 --> 09:10.466
[Phil] Now, I'm looking forward
to this wild boar.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.801
-[Allie] The boar?
-[Phil] Go.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.058
Mm.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.226
Mm.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.310
That's the best one.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.271
That's very good.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.188
Has a little spice.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.524
Then there's a pickled onion,
pickled carrot...

09:27.275 --> 09:28.568
It kind of refreshes everything.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.944
-This is great.
-[Allie] Yeah.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.029
Wild boar.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.824
-[Phil] I'll try one of his sauces.
-[Allie] Great.

09:34.907 --> 09:35.908
Are you brave enough?

09:36.659 --> 09:37.535
Oh. [chuckles]

09:46.043 --> 09:47.295
It's like a time bomb.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.382
Ooh. Oh.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.177
Why am I stupid?

09:55.720 --> 10:00.308
I put like five drops of nuclear holocaust
on my sandwich.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.934
[Allie chuckles]

10:04.186 --> 10:06.397
Richard, I want you to try something.
[chuckles]

10:06.480 --> 10:08.482
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.039
[Phil] One of my favorite things to do
is just walk around a new city,

10:23.122 --> 10:25.416
get a little lost in it,
explore it, like any tourist.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.253
Who knows?
Maybe you meet a new friend or two.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.302
My wanderings bring me to La Recoleta,

10:36.844 --> 10:39.597
considered one of the most beautiful
cemeteries in the world.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.267
And I can't say I disagree.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.728
This is a very nice neighborhood.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.022
It's absolutely beautiful.

10:48.105 --> 10:52.109
It's like a gorgeous park with
these amazing mausoleums above ground.

10:54.070 --> 10:58.407
Recoleta is the final resting place of
some Argentinian presidents, dignitaries,

10:58.574 --> 11:01.077
Nobel prize winners, and cultural icons,

11:01.160 --> 11:02.870
including one you've probably heard of.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.705
It's the tomb of Eva Perón,

11:04.830 --> 11:08.125
beloved first lady of Argentina
who died in 1952.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.045
You probably know her
from the musical Evita.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.797
Don't worry, I'm not singing.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.134
You almost don't realize
you're in a cemetery.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.886
And you don't feel sad, really...

11:20.471 --> 11:22.223
until you hear some of the stories.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.975
[woman] You can see that lady
opening the door?

11:25.059 --> 11:27.186
She was celebrating her 19th birthday,

11:27.269 --> 11:28.896
she went to bed and she died.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.690
So they buried her,

11:30.773 --> 11:32.858
and the next day the coffin was opened

11:32.942 --> 11:35.152
and they say it was scratched.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.196
She was buried alive.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.033
That's-- That's very uplifting.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.453
But some of the stories are pretty funny.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.247
[Phil] This is Mr. Carril...

11:46.956 --> 11:48.791
and he lived in the 1800s,

11:49.333 --> 11:52.253
and he had a wife
that spent all his money.

11:52.503 --> 11:56.215
He wrote a letter publicly that he wasn't
paying anymore debts on his wife.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.508
She got very mad at that.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.636
And so they didn't speak
for 20 or 30 years.

12:01.262 --> 12:05.933
He died first and she said on their tomb,
she didn't want them facing each other.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.229
So this is
a lovely testament to eternal hatred.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.941
[Phil] I do hope Monica
wants to face me when we're dead.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.371
[Phil] I don't usually see
eating as political

12:27.455 --> 12:29.290
but this place, Perón Perón,

12:29.373 --> 12:32.251
takes nostalgia
for their complicated former president

12:32.793 --> 12:35.796
and turns it into a rowdy
communal experience.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.049
Gonzalo Pagés is a chef,

12:39.550 --> 12:42.803
and he loves Juan Perón who was
elected president in the late '40s,

12:42.887 --> 12:45.097
early '50s, and again in the '70s.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.810
I can't figure him out
as a figure in history,

12:49.894 --> 12:51.729
because he seemed
to be liberal on one hand

12:51.812 --> 12:53.272
and a dictator on the other hand.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.732
Uh...

12:54.815 --> 12:57.735
It's what they see from outside.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.945
Argentina for a long time was

13:00.029 --> 13:04.408
run by the oligarchy,
the military, and the Catholic Church.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.119
Perón break with that.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.830
He put first the workers.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.624
Free medical, free education.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.417
-Women vote.
-Women vote.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.086
He gave vacation to the workers.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.089
That is not what a dictator would do.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.592
No. But I just tell you what I read.
Right?

13:22.176 --> 13:26.138
That if anyone opposed him,
he would maybe put them in jail,

13:26.222 --> 13:29.308
maybe was violent. Is that not right?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.311
I bring some empanadas...

13:32.394 --> 13:33.687
[laughs]

13:33.771 --> 13:35.815
...to stop talking.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.732
Have some wine.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.861
This is wine from Salta.
Torrontés. Do you like wine?

13:41.111 --> 13:42.571
I like how you changed the subject.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.572
Hey.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.325
[Phil] That's okay.
I'd rather talk empanadas anyway.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.828
Uh, you have to first shake it.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.204
-Shake it.
-Really?

13:51.038 --> 13:52.623
[Phil] I never knew you shook them.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.416
-Yes because it's very juicy.
-Yeah.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.503
You have to move the juice along the--

13:57.795 --> 13:59.171
We're moving the juice.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.590
[in Argentine accent] Juice. The juice.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.386
In Hebrew school, that's all I did,
was look for Jewess.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.972
[chuckles]

14:08.055 --> 14:11.517
Then bite and give it a long deep kiss.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.895
Like your girlfriend. Like this.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.021
My girlfriend?

14:17.773 --> 14:20.067
Because it's full of juice, like a woman.

14:23.654 --> 14:24.613
[Gonzalo] Juicy.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.699
Spicy.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.998
You know, I never had an empanada before.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.959
-Never? The first empanada?
-Yeah, I love it.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.128
This guy wasn't even a chef.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.548
He was a psychologist,
he worked with anorexic people.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.342
He's got a lot going on, this guy.

14:45.426 --> 14:49.013
But he's now channeling it
into delicious comfort food.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.472
-Yes.
-Wow.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.559
[Gonzalo] This is a pacu,
the cousin of piranhas.

14:54.810 --> 14:58.314
Did you read that in U.S.A.
there were some pacu

14:58.397 --> 15:00.357
biting the balls off
the people in the river?

15:00.441 --> 15:02.818
-Biting the balls off the people?
-The balls. The balls.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.903
I know what you mean.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.156
Yeah. The pacu have the same teeth--

15:07.239 --> 15:08.157
As a piranha?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.283
As a persona.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.534
Oh, as a person!

15:10.618 --> 15:12.786
Yes. It's very-- Yes.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.497
-And they go for that part?
-Yes.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.166
[Phil] I'll go for this part instead.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.335
[Phil] Wow. This is a meaty...

15:20.002 --> 15:21.253
-Do you like it?
-I do.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.255
[Phil] A very good fish.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.424
A wonderful fish. I really love it.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.594
[Phil]
I like the crispiness and it's tender.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.512
[Gonzalo] Everybody loves salmon.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.764
I was going to do that show.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.015
[Gonzalo] But this is juicy.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.476
Yeah! You like juicy.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.145
-Yes. Do you want a dry meat?
-No!

15:38.228 --> 15:39.563
-A juicy meat.
-Yes!

15:45.069 --> 15:47.529
Whoa! Whoa! I'm impressed!

15:47.613 --> 15:50.908
That's a magic trick. Wow.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.576
How long was this roasting?

15:53.535 --> 15:55.371
Ten... [beep] ...hours.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.664
[chuckles]

15:57.581 --> 16:00.417
[Gonzalo] I believe
that food and love are together.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.335
[Phil] You're right.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.546
[Phil] Gonzalo and his food
have made me see the light.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.756
You can't fight it.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.341
It's too good.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.929
[Phil] I got an education.
Everything from Perón--

16:12.012 --> 16:14.640
To a deep kiss to an empanada.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.558
All roads lead to that.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.770
-All leads to the woman.
-[chuckles]

16:19.853 --> 16:21.981
And wine. And friendship.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.607
And enjoy the life.

16:24.566 --> 16:25.526
Enjoy your life.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.152
Enjoy your life!

16:27.236 --> 16:28.237
Listen to him.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.115
Yes. Do it. Now. Go.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.421
[Phil] Porteños love their markets,

16:45.504 --> 16:48.841
and the San Telmo neighborhood
hosts a particularly impressive one

16:48.924 --> 16:51.176
with food, crafts, and antiques

16:51.260 --> 16:54.388
winding for miles
all through the historic streets.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.474
[man speaking Spanish]

16:57.558 --> 16:59.852
[Phil] Just a few days here,
and I already need a new belt.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.360
[speaking Spanish]

17:09.153 --> 17:10.863
[Phil] Good thing I got
the extra large belt

17:10.946 --> 17:14.742
because I'm going to pay a visit
to the godmother of new Argentine cuisine,

17:14.825 --> 17:15.701
Narda Lepes.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.787
She's been on TV for decades
and written cookbooks,

17:18.871 --> 17:22.041
but this is her first restaurant,
Narda Comedor.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.170
Narda's focus is a little different
from what you tend to find around town.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.298
Argentineans are
very proud of their meat.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.674
-Yeah.
-Very proud.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.135
[Narda] But we are
a vegetable-forward restaurant.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.597
How do you call this? Chinese cabbage?

17:36.680 --> 17:39.600
-You find that in Chinese chicken salad.
-Yeah. Yeah, that one.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.812
Okay. A little bit of salt
between the leaves.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.939
A little bit of olive oil.

17:48.233 --> 17:53.155
We paint it with a sauce made
out of a lot of herbs and buffalo yogurt.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.948
-Oh.
-[Narda] Yes.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.119
We take a lot of different leaves
and we cover it up...

17:59.203 --> 18:01.205
-[Phil] Very cool salad.
-[Narda] ...like this...

18:01.288 --> 18:02.539
with some almonds

18:02.623 --> 18:05.084
-so you have a crunchy thing on it.
-[Phil] Yeah.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.544
-[Narda] Soft boiled egg.
-[Phil] Oh.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.506
-We put this here.
-I like it.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.930
Mm.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.682
Creamy and crunchy and herby flavor.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.643
-[Narda] It's a happy dish.
-I'm very happy.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.728
Mm.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.773
[Phil] Next she brings something that
doesn't really scream Argentina either.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.401
In Latin America,
nobody will eat tofu like this...

18:31.902 --> 18:34.154
-raw and white and cold.
-Yeah.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.948
So I'll do it the way I like to eat it.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.826
-First, ginger... juice.
-[Phil] Ah.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.704
Sesame oil. Spring onions. Fried garlic.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.705
Oh, I love garlic.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.917
[Narda] Sesame. A lot of tempura crumbs.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.671
-This is called Tofu Trash.
-[Phil chuckles]

18:50.754 --> 18:52.005
-So it has to be trashy.
-Good.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.549
[Narda] This is sweet chili sauce.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.385
-A little bit. And this is ponzu sauce.
-Yeah. Ah.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.305
[Phil] The crunch is everything, right?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.431
[Narda] Yeah.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.183
Honestly never had a better tofu dish.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.936
[Phil] Narda's amazing.
I'm not missing meat at all.

19:06.019 --> 19:06.854
Oh.

19:08.021 --> 19:08.939
[Phil] What?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.441
[Phil] But it had been missing me.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.111
Look at that dish. Come on, people!

19:14.194 --> 19:16.530
[Phil] She's putting greens
on there. It looks like salad.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.783
[Narda] Put just a tiny bit of salt.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.035
This salt comes from Patagonia.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.289
[Phil] Look how beautiful.
You don't even need a knife, do you?

19:25.372 --> 19:27.541
[Narda] You don't need one.
You can break it like this.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.089
Mm.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.340
You! Genius.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.427
-[Narda] Ready for the sweet?
-Yes.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.058
-So you have like a big bowl of fruit.
-Yeah.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.185
[Narda] As a dessert.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.812
-It's not fruit salad. I don't like them.
-[Phil] Good. No.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.732
Because they always put
like a bad apple in it.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.400
It mushes together, all tastes the same.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.277
-The banana is all ruined.
-Yeah.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.529
-It piss me off a bit.
-[Phil] I'm angry hearing it.

19:58.113 --> 19:58.947
I don't...

19:59.031 --> 20:00.199
[beep] ...you, fruit salad.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.408
[Narda chuckles]

20:01.491 --> 20:03.410
Why don't we call it that?
[beep] ...salad.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.536
[Narda] Salad, okay.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.417
[Phil] Oh, that's... [beep] ...delicious.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.337
But the winner is her chocolate cake

20:13.795 --> 20:17.674
filled with, yes, dulce de leche.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.180
You have a little bit there.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.890
This is my favorite restaurant now.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.767
-Who made this?
-[Narda] Carolina.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.936
[Phil] Very innovative, very creative.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.396
Stephanie may have something
to do. You can hug her too.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.525
I'm making a prediction
that Narda Comedor will be on

20:35.859 --> 20:40.614
the top of the top of the list
of best restaurants in Argentina,

20:40.906 --> 20:43.033
if not all of South America,
if not the world.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.244
[Phil] Goodbye! [chuckles]

21:04.096 --> 21:09.726
Everyone was telling me that Jewish food
is very big in Buenos Aires

21:09.810 --> 21:12.354
because there's an enormous
Jewish population here.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.232
And I said, "Enough already! I'm--

21:15.315 --> 21:18.777
How many Jewish places can we go?
We're finding them all over the world."

21:18.860 --> 21:21.071
And it's not like I'm looking for them.
They find me.

21:21.655 --> 21:25.284
I just don't want it to be so Jewish.
All the time Jewish.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.369
What's the name of the place? Mishiguene.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.913
They spell it differently down here,

21:29.997 --> 21:32.165
but mishiguene is still
the Yiddish word for crazy.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.418
To find out what's so crazy about it,

21:34.501 --> 21:35.919
I'm here with my new friend Allie.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.212
[Tomás] Welcome to Mishiguene.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.630
-Chef Tomás!
-[Allie] Hello.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.550
-[Tomás] Very nice to have you here.
-I love meeting you. I've read all--

21:41.633 --> 21:43.427
[Phil] Tomás Kalika is from Buenos Aires,

21:43.510 --> 21:46.221
but he spent time in Israel
and this is his passion.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.308
Kind of modernized old Jewish food.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.476
Why did you name the restaurant
Mishiguene?

21:51.560 --> 21:55.689
A very good friend give us the name
because I had another restaurant

21:55.772 --> 21:57.649
and it was really bad.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.026
-You had a bad restaurant?
-Yes.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.319
She knows that. She knows.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.945
I wrote a bad review once on it.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.573
And he still talks to you?
Because you agreed with her.

22:04.656 --> 22:08.410
-So you are admitting you were terrible?
-[Tomás] Yes.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.537
[Phil] Only somebody
who's mishiguene would do that.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.455
[Allie] Exactly.

22:11.538 --> 22:12.873
[laughs]

22:12.956 --> 22:16.084
[Phil] It's also mishiguene that he
starts me off with gefilte fish

22:16.168 --> 22:17.794
and that it looks fantastic.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.339
So this is the recipe
of my grandmother Olga.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.465
-Go first.
-[Allie] Okay.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.884
-[Phil] And I'll see what happens to you.
-[chuckles]

22:23.967 --> 22:25.802
[Allie] It smells like gefilte fish.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.388
[both] Is that a good or bad thing?

22:28.472 --> 22:31.600
In my house if you walked in
and said, "It smells like gefilte fish,"

22:31.683 --> 22:33.060
you wouldn't wanna be there."

22:34.227 --> 22:36.646
[Tomás] And you must eat it all.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.023
You should try this.

22:39.983 --> 22:40.859
Mm.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.320
How do you describe gefilte fish
to someone who's not had it?

22:43.403 --> 22:45.364
-Like a cow pie...
-[Tomás] Yeah.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.032
[laughing]

22:47.115 --> 22:49.076
-...of mushed up fish.
-[Tomás] Yes.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.704
But it takes some talent to make it nice.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.622
Exactly.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.665
[Phil] What I didn't know before I came

22:55.749 --> 22:59.211
was that Buenos Aires
has a huge Jewish population.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.128
I had no idea.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.255
One of the largest in Latin America.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.716
Because here's what I heard,
and I bet you heard the same.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.927
After World War II, who came here?

23:08.136 --> 23:09.846
-The Nazis!
-Of course.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.473
You ever spot one on the street?

23:11.556 --> 23:12.599
I've suspected.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.935
-Sometimes I play the Nazi game.
-You have? Really?

23:15.018 --> 23:16.812
This guy a Nazi?
Is this guy not a Nazi?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.855
-You really play that?
-I've played it. [chuckles]

23:18.939 --> 23:20.941
That's so much fun!
I'm going to do it after dinner.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.402
-You are Jewish?
-Who wants to know?

23:24.027 --> 23:25.695
You know how to play this. No?

23:25.779 --> 23:27.072
Oh.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.156
A shofar.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.784
Big. What are you compensating for?

23:30.867 --> 23:32.327
[chuckles]

23:32.411 --> 23:34.204
[squeaking]

23:34.287 --> 23:35.956
[horn blows weakly]

23:40.585 --> 23:43.004
Hey! Mazel tov!

23:46.508 --> 23:48.093
[Richard laughs]

23:48.176 --> 23:50.762
David Schneider donates 50 dollars.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.181
-Very good.
-[crew claps]

23:53.265 --> 23:55.350
I'm going to make that sound
after dinner too.

23:55.434 --> 23:59.479
[Phil] For this next dish, I don't need
a shofar, I need a choir of angels.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.773
-[Phil gasps]
-[Tomás] You know what this pastrami is?

24:01.857 --> 24:03.066
Yes, chef.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.526
This is grano de pecho.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.612
It's under the neck of the cow.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.574
-To serve this with a very special pasta.
-Yes.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.702
My grandmother Olga used to make this.

24:13.785 --> 24:14.619
[Phil] Again Olga.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.205
-Yes, of course. This is called farfalaj.
-Olga is a great cook.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.792
We're going to serve you the pastrami
with spoons. Okay?

24:20.876 --> 24:21.877
-[Phil gasps]
-Wow.

24:21.960 --> 24:22.794
What?

24:23.545 --> 24:25.464
[Phil] And now we're getting
totally mishiguene.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.507
[Tomás] We serve two kinds of pastrami.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.051
The other one very Argentinian
with a whole rib.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.553
[Phil gasps] Look at that.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.972
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.892
[Tomás] Two very different flavors.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.185
-Enjoy.
-[Phil] Thank you.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.395
[Allie] The neck pastrami.

24:45.025 --> 24:45.901
Chef!

24:46.443 --> 24:48.320
[Phil] Melt in your mouth. Right?

24:49.237 --> 24:51.281
And now I have to move to Buenos Aires.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.992
[Phil] After a meal
of his bubbe's recipes,

24:54.075 --> 24:56.286
it's only fitting
that we end by toasting her.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.706
Grandma Olga used to drink a lot of vodka.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.000
-Wow!
-Ta-da!

25:04.169 --> 25:05.128
One for you.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.756
What a nice piece of Judaica this is.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.007
[laughs]

25:09.090 --> 25:11.092
-L'chaim.
-L'chaim.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.428
[Tomás] L'chaim. L'chaim.
L'chaim. L'chaim.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.431
-L'chaim.
-[Tomás chuckles]

25:29.945 --> 25:32.531
[Phil] Today I'm going for tango lessons.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.118
I think this is the most scared I've been.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.036
Wow.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.456
This beautiful lady Cecilia Piccinni

25:41.540 --> 25:44.417
[Phil] who's a professional dancer
and dance instructor...

25:44.960 --> 25:46.294
-Hello.
-[Cecilia] Hello.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.755
[Phil] And I'm going
to humiliate myself in front of her.

25:48.838 --> 25:49.923
I'm nervous.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.551
Tango is mostly about walking.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.970
If you can walk, then you can dance.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.137
See, that's the thing.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.556
[chuckles]

25:57.639 --> 25:58.682
Just give me a hug.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.518
-A hug? Yes. Okay.
-Yes. Okay.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.520
-I apologize...
-You don't have to.

26:03.603 --> 26:06.856
...for the debasement
of this beautiful art form in advance.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.191
You can release your arms.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.068
Oh, we're done? Okay.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.154
Just keep your arms
as if you were hugging me.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.407
From here, just try to walk.

26:19.828 --> 26:23.498
I know to look at me you'd think,
"This guy can do anything."

26:23.582 --> 26:26.585
Tango requires a certain masculinity...

26:28.128 --> 26:29.713
a macho thing.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.173
I'm ill-equipped.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.216
How am I doing?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.051
-You are great.
-This is not dancing.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.803
This is not dancing yet.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.263
-Music on please.
-Music?

26:38.346 --> 26:39.180
["El Choclo" plays]

26:39.264 --> 26:42.934
Welcome to a special episode
of Dancing with Schlemiels.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.195
-Stop.
-[music stops]

26:54.279 --> 26:55.739
I need one thing.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.533
No bouncing.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.785
We are not walking... like this.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.037
I do a little. Yeah. Okay.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.041
-Music. Now one step backwards.
-Whenever I want?

27:06.124 --> 27:07.334
Whenever you want.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.628
["El Choclo" plays]

27:09.711 --> 27:11.171
-One step.
-Only one. Yeah.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.256
-[Phil] Got it.
-[Cecilia] Forward, side, back.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.843
Oh. Back to this
or do you go forward from here?

27:17.385 --> 27:18.845
That's exactly up to you.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.223
-You're gonna follow no matter what I do?
-That's the idea.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.684
So if I sit down and have a coffee,
you're going to sit down?

27:25.435 --> 27:28.104
Music. I want you to feel this.

27:28.938 --> 27:29.856
All right.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.524
-[Cecilia] Left, right.
-[Phil] Mm-hmm.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.027
-Left, right.
-Mm-hmm.

27:34.110 --> 27:34.986
I go...

27:35.820 --> 27:37.614
[Cecilia] Exactly.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.202
-[Cecilia] Wow.
-Wow?

27:44.329 --> 27:46.539
-Now fancier stuff.
-Mm-hmm.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.876
We will be moving our torso
in one direction,

27:49.959 --> 27:54.172
and our lower body
in another direction for example.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.090
[Phil] Oh, boy.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.426
Yeah.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.597
You're always facing each other.
Always facing each other.

28:02.681 --> 28:06.267
If you don't, then it's
as if I'm dancing with someone there

28:06.351 --> 28:07.811
and you dance with someone there.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.062
Don't dance with another--

28:09.145 --> 28:10.063
-All right.
-All right.

28:10.146 --> 28:12.232
I want to add one little thing.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.651
All right. If you think you can handle it.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.277
[Cecilia] It's called ochos.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.863
Together. Together.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.366
-Yes.
-And around. See?

28:21.825 --> 28:23.159
And how do we stop it?

28:24.035 --> 28:27.497
Four--
You can have me all night doing ochos.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.332
[Cecilia] One...

28:29.791 --> 28:31.209
["El Choclo" plays]

28:31.292 --> 28:32.711
Four, five.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.381
Seven, eight. Good!

28:40.468 --> 28:41.428
Good.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.724
Three, four, five.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.401
-Was that right?
-Yes!

28:56.484 --> 28:58.737
-I'm not the worst?
-No, no, no, no.

28:58.820 --> 29:02.157
-You're far away from the worst.
-Oh, that's going to be on my...

29:02.699 --> 29:03.992
-Yes.
-Thank you.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.493
-Oh, thank you.
-Very, very good.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.039
[Phil] Buenos Aires is a colorful city.

29:10.540 --> 29:13.501
But the top-rated restaurant
in all of Argentina,

29:14.127 --> 29:16.838
serving some of the most colorful
cutting-edge food,

29:17.338 --> 29:20.633
hides on a quiet street
behind this nondescript door.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.052
This is Tegui.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.512
Chef owner Germán Martitegui

29:24.596 --> 29:27.807
is famous for his creative dishes
of subtlety and surprise.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.019
Germán is an intense guy,

29:31.102 --> 29:34.063
so I brought his good friend
and my new friend Narda with me

29:34.147 --> 29:35.148
to help lighten him up.

29:35.231 --> 29:37.025
[Narda] There's a secret about his food.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.235
-[Phil] Yeah.
-He loves fruit.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.530
And in every dish, probably...

29:43.114 --> 29:45.784
we're going to get some fruit
in some kind of way.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.038
Here we are.
Okay, these are grilled oysters...

29:52.415 --> 29:53.833
and green strawberries.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.002
[Phil] Not ripe strawberries.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.337
They're very difficult to find.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.048
When you ask for ripe strawberries,
they send you these.

30:00.131 --> 30:03.092
And when you ask for
the green strawberries, they send you--

30:04.302 --> 30:05.637
[Phil] Ooh, what's happening?

30:05.720 --> 30:07.055
[Germán] Water from the oysters.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.723
-[Phil] Yes.
-[Germán] We make a foam.

30:08.890 --> 30:09.891
-Sea foam.
-You did it.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.311
He throws it to you like that.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.564
Oh!

30:16.648 --> 30:19.108
-[Narda] That's good.
-Wow! That's the ocean.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.071
[Germán] Anchovies.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.323
These anchovies
are coming from my hometown.

30:25.865 --> 30:26.699
And some kumquat.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.952
[Narda] I told you about the fruit,
which I love.

30:29.702 --> 30:33.248
[Germán] We made a broth
with peaches and cúrcuma.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.165
[Narda] Turmeric.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.458
Isn't that beautiful?

30:39.003 --> 30:41.339
When the anchovy touches your tongue...

30:41.422 --> 30:42.507
-Salt.
-...in the beginning,

30:42.590 --> 30:44.342
it's strong and covers it all,

30:44.425 --> 30:48.847
and then you bite and you get the creamy,
the fat, and the citrus and cleans it up.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.765
[Germán] She must be here daily.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.852
She's good. She's much better
at describing than me.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.061
I'm like, "Mm. That's good."

30:55.144 --> 30:56.312
[all chuckle]

30:56.855 --> 31:01.568
Once in Nice, he followed me around
with 13 types of chicharrón.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.862
"Is this the best fat you ever had? No?

31:03.945 --> 31:07.115
Or is it this one? Or this one?
Try it, try it."

31:07.198 --> 31:09.450
Like a maniac for days.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.120
[Phil] Oh.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.997
-What happened?
-Fruit-- What are you doing?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.875
[Germán] You know? I hate this
because if you're coming from Narda's,

31:16.958 --> 31:18.376
what I serve is nothing.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.336
What is this mean?

31:21.921 --> 31:22.755
Maybe-- Yeah.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.132
[Phil] All right.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.050
[Germán] Watermelon, onions, radish.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.093
Nice.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.970
[Germán] And then you have frog leg.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.139
-Really?
-Have you ever had it?

31:31.222 --> 31:32.348
-I love frog's legs.
-Okay.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.726
[Germán] This is an oregano oil frozen.

31:34.809 --> 31:35.977
[Phil] Ooh.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.020
Oh, shh.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.481
[Narda] Mm.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.321
This is very good.
I shouldn't be saying this, but...

31:46.404 --> 31:47.447
Be proud.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.033
Be proud of your radish drink.

31:50.116 --> 31:51.367
[Germán] Are you still hungry?

31:51.451 --> 31:52.744
-Yeah, of course.
-Okay.

31:52.827 --> 31:54.662
-"Are you still hungry?"
-[Narda] We're sharing.

31:54.746 --> 31:58.416
-We had little things like this.
-[whispers] He's playing with us, I think.

31:59.083 --> 31:59.918
[Phil] Tortellini.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.962
And this,
we have lemon-infused olive oil.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.797
That's beautiful.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.676
-Mm.
-Mm!

32:08.760 --> 32:10.261
We have Julián,

32:10.345 --> 32:13.181
he makes one thousand
of these tortellinis per day.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.099
-One thousand?
-[Germán] Yeah, by hand.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.101
-One guy?
-[Germán] Yeah.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.855
I talked to that guy first,
and this guy stole him from me.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.192
-Is that true?
-No. We met him together.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.194
-I talked to him first.
-At the same exact time.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.320
But I talked to him first.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.364
-I love this.
-[Germán] Who talked to you first?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.448
Narda or me?

32:30.531 --> 32:32.367
-Who you work with first?
-[Phil] You're him?

32:32.450 --> 32:33.826
-[speaking Spanish]
-Germán.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.328
[Narda] Liar.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.538
-He's the one who makes 1,000?
-[Germán] Yes.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.040
Only one minute per tortellini.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.084
[Phil] So that's a thousand minutes.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.836
-He doesn't see the light.
-The tortellini vampire.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.381
-[Phil] Wait. Where you going?
-[Germán] Sorry.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.590
He was going to take it away.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.720
Why is the chef eating our food?
We got to tell him to back off.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.806
He binges when he's nervous.

32:55.932 --> 32:56.933
Maybe some dessert.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.311
[Germán] He's really crazy
with desserts, you know?

33:00.395 --> 33:01.479
-Okay. Me too.
-Yeah.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.444
[Phil] Oh, that kind of crazy.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.698
[all chuckle]

33:11.781 --> 33:12.657
[Phil] Checkmate.

33:14.283 --> 33:17.203
But we all win with Germán's take
on the Argentinian classic.

33:17.453 --> 33:20.456
[Germán] Dulce de leche
dehydrated for two months.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.085
And this is our seven cereals ice cream.

33:25.211 --> 33:27.922
If it sticks to your palate,
you can't talk for--

33:28.006 --> 33:31.801
You're going to take dulce de leche
out of your teeth for a week.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.345
[Phil] Nice. I like souvenirs.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.623
[mooing]

34:02.707 --> 34:05.543
[Phil] The Argentinian love of beef
is legendary,

34:05.626 --> 34:09.380
and so is the guy who takes care
of the beef, the gaucho.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.132
Gauchos have been herding cattle

34:11.215 --> 34:13.718
and wrangling wild horses here
for centuries.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.762
Hungry work plus lots of cows equals

34:15.845 --> 34:20.433
the best barbeque culture in the world
called the asado.

34:20.808 --> 34:23.311
I'm lucky enough to catch
a glimpse of this mythic world

34:23.394 --> 34:26.481
at Estancia El Ombú, a working ranch.

34:26.564 --> 34:29.275
Even better, I'm going
to at least eat like a gaucho

34:29.358 --> 34:30.943
at the estancia's restaurant.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.864
Joining me today is Felicitas Pizarro.

34:34.947 --> 34:37.658
She's a great chef and an expert on asado.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.702
-It's very simple here.
-[Phil] Yeah.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.996
[Felicitas] Meat and salt.

34:42.955 --> 34:44.749
Cooked outside and over wood fire.

34:47.543 --> 34:50.213
-[Phil] The smoke, the wood--
-[Felicitas] The wood flavors.

34:50.671 --> 34:51.547
[Phil] Delicious.

34:52.965 --> 34:56.219
Everyone told me, "All your meat
is going to be overcooked here."

34:56.302 --> 34:58.846
But it's not true.
Perfectly done, medium rare.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.056
[Felicitas] This is perfect.

35:00.139 --> 35:03.893
But usually Argentinians
prefer the meat well-done.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.186
-Why?
-[Felicitas] I don't know.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.396
I prefer it medium rare.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.484
Beautiful. It's worth coming here
just for lunch.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.611
-Look where we are. It's--
-And a wonderful day.

35:15.571 --> 35:20.368
[Phil] It really does remind me of
the Old South in America or the Old West.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.994
-Cowboys.
-[Phil] Cowboys.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.497
-But they dress better than ours.
-[Felicitas] Mm.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.124
[Phil] They all carry the knife.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.834
[Felicitas] Every gaucho
has its own knife.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.044
For tradition
or because they really use it?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.338
No, they really use it for everything.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.340
And when they eat,
they have their own knife.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.925
[Felicitas] If you invite a gaucho

35:36.008 --> 35:40.638
to your house and you make a barbeque,
they'd probably take their own knife.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.890
-Never invited a gaucho to your house?
-Mm-hmm.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.350
Yes? They brought their own knife?

35:44.433 --> 35:45.601
Uh-huh. Yes.

35:45.685 --> 35:49.230
[Phil] After lunch, they set up
for a classic gaucho dance called a gato

35:50.064 --> 35:51.440
featuring stupido.

35:51.607 --> 35:52.567
What am I doing?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.610
[rhythmic clapping]

35:55.444 --> 35:56.612
Watch him.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.449
[Phil] Once again a two year old
is better than me.

36:01.534 --> 36:02.869
God, I don't want to step on him.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.246
[man singing in Spanish]

36:08.457 --> 36:10.209
Yeah? I'm doing it?

36:24.056 --> 36:25.016
[woman] Yay.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.356
[Phil] I've gotten a nice peek
into the daily life of a gaucho...

36:32.857 --> 36:35.860
but apparently they don't think
a peek is enough.

36:48.122 --> 36:48.956
[horse whinnies]

36:52.001 --> 36:54.003
[Phil] And here's
the last known footage of me alive.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.222
What if my wife sees this and likes it?

37:04.305 --> 37:06.390
Then she'll want me
to wear this around the house.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.391
[chuckles]

37:07.475 --> 37:09.936
This is really, for me,
the road not taken.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.690
And suddenly I'm feeling like maybe...

37:14.774 --> 37:17.068
maybe I could be a cowboy. [chuckles]

37:17.151 --> 37:18.319
Oh. Ow.

37:23.532 --> 37:24.784
[horse nickers]

37:24.867 --> 37:25.701
I agree.

37:25.785 --> 37:26.744
[mooing]

37:27.954 --> 37:29.205
[Phil clicking tongue]

37:32.041 --> 37:34.252
Stay together cows! Stay together!

37:39.090 --> 37:41.592
What the hell? Who am I?

37:47.390 --> 37:48.432
Where you going?

37:48.516 --> 37:49.642
[clicks tongue]

37:50.685 --> 37:51.519
Go with them.

37:53.771 --> 37:54.772
That's right.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.023
That's right.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.401
I am a cowboy. Come on.

37:58.484 --> 38:02.405
I was rightfully terrified,
but if I can do this...

38:09.620 --> 38:10.621
[Phil] Is it dinner time?

38:24.760 --> 38:27.972
[Phil] More than half the population
in Buenos Aires is of Italian descent.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.143
Ah, ragazzi... [speaks Spanish]

38:32.226 --> 38:35.563
[Phil] Donato Di Santis
is from Puglia, Italy,

38:35.646 --> 38:40.026
and he opened a beautiful store
and restaurant called Cucina Paradiso.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.320
-Oh! Crazy man!
-[Donato] Phil! How are you, huh?

38:42.403 --> 38:43.654
-Nice to see you.
-How you doing?

38:43.738 --> 38:44.989
Welcome to Cucina.

38:45.072 --> 38:48.200
[Phil] Donato wants
to introduce me to Italian Bueno Aires

38:48.284 --> 38:49.869
by taking me on a little tasting tour.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.955
This is my kind of place.
I like it already.

38:53.539 --> 38:57.084
[Donato] Buenos Aires has, as you know,
a very strong Italian heritage,

38:57.168 --> 38:59.253
-but strangely enough...
-[Phil] Yeah?

38:59.587 --> 39:02.381
...very few do authentic Italian food.

39:02.965 --> 39:04.550
But you are 100 percent?

39:04.633 --> 39:06.761
I try to be as much as orthodox as I can.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.513
-Ah.
-Ah.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.723
Here we go. Buono.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.350
-[waitress] Enjoy.
-[Phil] Wow.

39:12.433 --> 39:15.019
This pasta is called
agnolotti con el plin.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.521
Plin is like-- See there's a little pinch?

39:18.022 --> 39:19.023
That's the plin.

39:19.690 --> 39:20.941
-Plin.
-Plin.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.151
Plin. [chuckles]

39:22.693 --> 39:26.238
[Donato] This is typical from Puglia.
Inside there, you have braised lamb.

39:31.577 --> 39:32.536
[Donato] Let's switch.

39:33.412 --> 39:36.207
Okay, this is orecchiette made by hand
with cavatelli.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.291
We call it maritata.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.584
Marriage of two pastas.

39:39.585 --> 39:40.628
Good, yeah.

39:40.711 --> 39:44.382
We should eat more pastas like this
that have a sauce like this with a spoon

39:44.465 --> 39:46.509
because you get more sauce.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.469
You're right. I never tried it.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.389
Mm! This is so good!

39:52.473 --> 39:55.059
-You're right. Tastes better with a spoon.
-You get more sauce!

39:56.060 --> 39:59.480
I've been hearing
that this is a huge pizza town.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.940
-[Donato] Yes.
-I'm a pizza freak.

40:01.023 --> 40:01.899
[Donato] Everywhere.

40:01.982 --> 40:05.194
And I want you to taste
a bizarre interpretation

40:05.277 --> 40:07.446
of the pizza here in Buenos Aires.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.823
-I can't wait.
-Shall we go?

40:08.906 --> 40:11.200
-Can I have one more?
-I'm amazed you don't gain any weight.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.453
-[Phil] Avanti.
-Avanti.

40:15.329 --> 40:17.123
So, I'm going to drive like an Italian.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.792
And I'm going to scream
like an old Jewish woman.

40:19.875 --> 40:24.672
[Donato laughs]

40:24.755 --> 40:26.340
[horn honks]

40:27.425 --> 40:29.802
[Phil] So now I'm going
on the vespa with Donato.

40:29.885 --> 40:33.013
It's not like riding a vespa
in Saigon or Bangkok.

40:35.933 --> 40:39.645
[Phil] There's not a lot of vespa guys
going around, so you're with the cars

40:39.728 --> 40:41.313
and I'm hanging on for dear life.

40:41.397 --> 40:42.565
But he's taking me to pizza.

40:42.648 --> 40:43.482
Hello!

40:43.566 --> 40:45.734
So I kind of will do anything
to get to pizza.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.621
Here's a place that's like 80 years old.

40:57.705 --> 40:58.956
It's called La Mezzetta.

40:59.039 --> 41:02.668
¿Maestro, puede manchar
una fugazza y fugazzetta por favor?

41:03.752 --> 41:07.339
That's-- Right away you're seeing a knife
that you don't see with pizza usually.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.257
-Yeah.
-Right?

41:09.884 --> 41:12.845
-Look at that cheese. No tomato sauce.
-This one is for you.

41:12.928 --> 41:15.931
No, this is only cheese,
extra cheese, and onions.

41:16.015 --> 41:16.891
Cheese and cheese.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.602
Look at this pizza. It's crazy.
What's it called?

41:19.685 --> 41:20.978
[server] Fugazzetta.

41:21.270 --> 41:22.521
[Phil] The fugazzetta.

41:23.147 --> 41:23.981
Forget about it.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.317
There's so much cheese on this pizza.

41:27.234 --> 41:28.068
Look. [chuckles]

41:28.152 --> 41:29.403
You pick it up and it does this.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.906
[Phil laughs]

41:31.989 --> 41:32.865
What? Ridiculous.

41:32.948 --> 41:36.285
[Phil] There are these wooden blocks
where it's holding the cheese in,

41:36.368 --> 41:38.204
which is great as they're cutting it.

41:38.787 --> 41:43.626
But you don't get a wooden block
when they give you the slice of pizza.

41:43.709 --> 41:45.461
-Mm.
-[Donato] Good?

41:45.544 --> 41:48.339
[Phil] That's really good cheese
and onion and oregano. Right?

41:48.881 --> 41:49.757
Beautiful crust.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.218
This is crazy.

41:52.968 --> 41:54.136
This is like a, you know...

41:54.220 --> 41:56.805
-You can put it over your shoulder.
-[Phil] Like a cheese scarf.

41:58.641 --> 42:01.352
[Phil] It's like waterfalls of cheese
coming off this pizza.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.897
I'm covered in it and I need a napkin.

42:05.981 --> 42:06.815
[Donato] There.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.695
[Phil] Is this a napkin? This is a napkin.
[chuckles]

42:11.779 --> 42:17.409
Hey, I can't tell you how much I love
this pizza and hated this napkin.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.536
Ridiculous.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.120
[Donato laughs]

42:20.204 --> 42:21.497
[Phil mumbles]

42:21.580 --> 42:24.375
The best pizza. Who do I have to talk to?

42:24.458 --> 42:26.293
It's the worst napkin
I've ever had in my life.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.964
Can you see this? What is this for?

42:30.047 --> 42:33.008
[server speaking Spanish]

42:33.092 --> 42:35.553
[Donato] He says it's the best
because it absorbs.

42:35.719 --> 42:36.720
Absorb?

42:36.929 --> 42:37.972
[Donato] Absorbs the fat.

42:38.430 --> 42:39.265
[Phil] Yeah?

42:40.558 --> 42:41.892
Yeah, but that, I mean...

42:41.976 --> 42:45.271
[server speaking Spanish]

42:45.854 --> 42:47.606
It barely makes a dent, my friend.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.651
I'm an American.
We're used to super absorbency.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.155
I may never go back because of the napkin.

42:55.239 --> 42:59.952
[Phil] Donato has taken me to great pizza,
his great Italian restaurant.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.912
What can I do for Donato?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.373
One of the great things I get to do

43:04.456 --> 43:08.002
is take him to a place
that I discovered in his town.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.046
Nola. We found this on our night off.

43:11.130 --> 43:13.382
Yes, Nola: New Orleans, Louisiana.

43:13.465 --> 43:14.758
This is New Orleans food.

43:14.842 --> 43:18.762
This is red beans and rice.
This is gumbo. Yeah?

43:18.846 --> 43:20.973
[Phil]
I had this unbelievable fried chicken.

43:21.056 --> 43:24.768
Like some of the best fried chicken
I've ever had in my life!

43:25.978 --> 43:29.481
They make this fried chicken in
tiny batches in little french fry baskets.

43:29.565 --> 43:32.860
They fry them. It takes a few minutes
for you to get a couple of pieces,

43:32.943 --> 43:35.195
but is it worth it? Yes!

43:35.779 --> 43:37.448
[Donato] Oh, by hand.
All right. Good.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.496
Right?

43:44.580 --> 43:48.709
-[Donato] Juicy. Crispy. Spicy. Flavorful.
-[Phil] Fried chicken. Yes.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.002
Everything all together.

43:50.794 --> 43:52.087
-I knew I liked you.
-Yeah.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.923
Honest. This is happiness.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.216
Yes, it's fried happiness.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.509
-[Phil] Liza!
-This is awesome!

43:57.593 --> 44:00.012
-Come meet me because I love you...
-Awesome.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.221
...and I don't even know you.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.308
-[Donato] The lady of the house.
-It's that Southern hospitality.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.518
-Thank you. You're wonderful.
-De nada.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.687
-Liza, right? Okay.
-Liza.

44:08.771 --> 44:09.605
It's really good.

44:09.688 --> 44:12.274
Yeah, you have a little sweat
under your eyes I think.

44:12.566 --> 44:14.234
-That's a good sign.
-That means it's good.

44:14.318 --> 44:18.739
[Phil] Liza's from New Orleans. She came
to turn porteños onto her food. It worked.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.532
-[Donato] Now we get to try...
-Yeah?

44:20.616 --> 44:22.201
...Liza's napkins.

44:22.284 --> 44:25.245
They're better than your fakakta napkins
at the other place.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.705
[Liza] Wax paper napkins?

44:26.789 --> 44:30.250
Like a sheet of notebook paper.
What are you supposed to do with this?

44:31.210 --> 44:33.629
[Donato] Next step. This already--

44:33.712 --> 44:34.713
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

44:35.255 --> 44:36.840
-Look!
-I didn't have enough cheese today.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.093
[Liza] Inspired by chicken parm.

44:39.176 --> 44:42.513
I have something to tell you both that you
probably don't know about each other.

44:42.596 --> 44:43.764
Where in Italy are you from?

44:43.847 --> 44:45.557
-Puglia.
-Yeah. What's your last name?

44:45.641 --> 44:46.725
-Puglia.
-You're kidding!

44:46.809 --> 44:47.893
Yeah!

44:47.976 --> 44:49.311
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.438
My great-grandparents came
to New Orleans from Puglia.

44:52.314 --> 44:55.734
[Donato] So, Phil. When you eat
something this good in Buenos Aires,

44:56.026 --> 44:59.071
you turn to the cook and you say,
"H de p."

44:59.154 --> 45:00.948
-H de p.
-H de p.

45:01.031 --> 45:02.574
-[Donato] H de p.
-H de p.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.284
-A little abbreviation.
-Did I just curse?

45:04.368 --> 45:05.285
Basically.

45:05.953 --> 45:06.912
[Donato] A compliment.

45:07.413 --> 45:10.791
Hache for hijo-- Son...
And then you can just guess the rest.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.710
Oh! That's not so bad.

45:12.793 --> 45:15.504
-Generally you do this when you say it.
-I do it. H de p.

45:15.754 --> 45:16.588
H de p.

45:16.672 --> 45:17.506
H de p.

45:18.590 --> 45:20.008
-[Donato] Ah.
-[Phil] Wow.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.682
[Phil] You might need
a bigger scooter.

45:35.149 --> 45:39.945
[Phil] Okay, now it's time to go all in
on that food Argentina's world famous for.

45:40.195 --> 45:43.031
Sorry to make you wait so long,
but I'm pretty sure it's worth it

45:43.115 --> 45:45.242
because in a city of great steak,

45:45.325 --> 45:48.662
this is one of the best,
I'm going to say, in world!

45:48.746 --> 45:49.663
Best in world!

45:50.372 --> 45:52.583
Don Julio Parrilla.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.460
Just two days earlier,

45:54.543 --> 45:57.963
Don Julio was honored as
the best steakhouse in Argentina

45:58.088 --> 46:00.841
and the number two restaurant
of any kind in the country.

46:01.258 --> 46:03.010
With news like that you got to celebrate.

46:03.385 --> 46:04.678
-Hola.
-[speaks Spanish]

46:04.762 --> 46:05.763
-[Phil] For me?
-Yes.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.598
-[Phil] Oh! Thank you!
-You're welcome.

46:09.141 --> 46:10.768
-Hola!
-Hola!

46:10.851 --> 46:11.852
Ah!

46:11.935 --> 46:16.315
[Phil] Today's special guests at Don Julio
are Julián from Los Galgos...

46:16.398 --> 46:17.441
Cheers.

46:17.524 --> 46:20.944
...and two of our fixers
here in Buenos Aires,

46:21.028 --> 46:23.781
Carola and Sol.

46:24.948 --> 46:26.992
[Phil] This looks like a temple of meat.

46:27.075 --> 46:28.535
-[Sol] Yeah. It is.
-[Carola] Yes.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.871
[Julián] They are
crazy people about the meat.

46:31.413 --> 46:32.998
That's the kind of crazy I like.

46:33.081 --> 46:34.208
[Julián laughs]

46:34.291 --> 46:36.335
[Phil] They start us off
with an Argentinian favorite.

46:36.418 --> 46:38.837
[Julián] This is sweetbreads, mollejas.

46:38.921 --> 46:41.924
For me, that-- Those are
the best sweetbreads...

46:42.007 --> 46:43.675
-In the planet.
-...in the planet.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.302
[Phil] In the planet. Just what I want.

46:45.385 --> 46:46.386
[Phil] Wow.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.680
-[Julián] Oh, take one.
-[Phil] No, no, no. I--

46:48.764 --> 46:50.349
I got to pace myself. I know what

46:50.432 --> 46:51.934
-[Julián laughs]
-[Phil] is happening.

46:53.852 --> 46:56.104
[Phil] Not sweet and not bread,
but very delicious.

46:58.273 --> 47:00.609
And just enough to get me ready
for the main event.

47:01.109 --> 47:05.280
A parade of grass-fed,
wet-aged Argentinian beef.

47:05.364 --> 47:06.698
[waiter] Attention, please.

47:06.782 --> 47:09.326
-[Phil] Attention, please. Oh! T-bone!
-[Sol] The house special.

47:09.409 --> 47:10.953
-Is that called a skirt steak?
-Yeah.

47:11.036 --> 47:12.120
[Julián] Look at the steak!

47:12.204 --> 47:13.413
I'm surrounded.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.249
-What's that?
-[Julián] A ribeye.

47:15.332 --> 47:16.834
[Phil] Look how beautiful that is.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.252
[Phil] It's perfectly cooked.

47:18.627 --> 47:19.878
Or as they say here...

47:19.962 --> 47:21.296
-[Sol] Jugoso.
-Jugoso.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.674
[Sol] Jugo is juice basically.

47:23.757 --> 47:25.050
We like it juicy.

47:25.133 --> 47:26.385
[gasps] Oh.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.053
[Julián] I'm so happy now, Phil.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.304
[Phil] I'm so happy now.

47:29.596 --> 47:32.808
I was thinking "I can't eat
any more meat this week. This is crazy."

47:32.891 --> 47:35.102
And now? Hoo, hoo, hoo.

47:36.603 --> 47:37.729
[Phil] Look how it cuts.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.107
-I love this place.
-[Carola] Mm.

47:40.190 --> 47:41.733
I really love this place.

47:45.070 --> 47:47.781
[Phil] I'm telling you, there's
more flavor in this little skirt steak

47:47.865 --> 47:50.450
than in 25 porterhouses
that I've had in my life.

47:50.534 --> 47:51.535
I can die now.

47:52.452 --> 47:54.079
[Sol] We say muy bueno.

47:54.580 --> 47:55.789
You put the moo in it.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.875
[Julián] Moo. [laughs]

48:00.085 --> 48:02.337
This is right at the top. I'm telling you.

48:03.755 --> 48:06.341
[Phil] This is
what people are talking about

48:06.425 --> 48:08.886
when they say, "This is
some of the best steak in the world."

48:09.553 --> 48:12.264
I don't know. It's maybe
what the cows are eating here,

48:12.347 --> 48:15.726
but the meat is
so tender and so flavorful.

48:19.605 --> 48:20.647
Need some more steak.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.108
[Skype ringing]

48:24.359 --> 48:26.570
-Oh! Hello!
-Hi.

48:27.279 --> 48:28.655
-[Max] Move over.
-[Phil chuckles]

48:28.739 --> 48:33.327
I'm trying. I can't just... Okay.

48:33.410 --> 48:35.621
-Are you good? Dad, come in the picture.
-[Max] Yeah.

48:35.704 --> 48:36.538
How are you?

48:36.622 --> 48:37.831
I'm very nice.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.542
I loved to see you dancing the tango.

48:40.626 --> 48:41.960
That was my favorite.

48:42.044 --> 48:45.088
That was the most frightening thing
I've done on the show so far.

48:45.172 --> 48:46.924
You looked terrific.

48:47.257 --> 48:51.094
Yep, but you danced a little bit klutzy.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.012
No, he didn't!

48:53.055 --> 48:54.264
No, he didn't.

48:54.765 --> 48:58.018
Stick to what you do best. Your gab--

48:58.101 --> 48:59.061
Gift for gab.

49:00.562 --> 49:01.605
Forget the dancing.

49:01.688 --> 49:02.898
[Helen] No, don't forget it.

49:02.981 --> 49:05.901
I think you did very well.
I don't agree with him.

49:05.984 --> 49:08.528
Okay. Because she's not a good dancer.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.364
[laughs]

49:10.447 --> 49:12.824
-Anyway--
-Anyway, are you having a good time?

49:12.908 --> 49:14.117
Not anymore!

49:14.201 --> 49:15.786
[Max and Helen laugh]

49:15.869 --> 49:17.788
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

49:17.871 --> 49:20.248
How could my dancing
have been a little better, Dad?

49:20.332 --> 49:22.459
You were a little stiff.

49:22.542 --> 49:24.378
Yeah. I never did this before.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.213
I don't believe you.

49:26.296 --> 49:29.341
It's amazing she got out
with all her toes to be honest.

49:29.424 --> 49:31.343
[Max laughs]

49:31.426 --> 49:33.553
So tell me about Buenos Aires.

49:33.637 --> 49:37.349
Look at this. You order a steak sandwich,
and this is what you get.

49:38.308 --> 49:39.351
[Max] Oh, my God.

49:39.434 --> 49:40.686
[Helen] I see the steak--

49:40.769 --> 49:42.104
But that's a big piece of steak.

49:42.187 --> 49:44.606
These are some sweet and hot peppers.

49:47.109 --> 49:48.402
Mm.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.737
Wow.

49:50.821 --> 49:51.822
You would like this.

49:52.114 --> 49:55.367
I know I would like it.
I'm getting very hungry.

49:55.450 --> 49:58.203
[chuckles]
Say hello to Richard and everybody else.

49:58.286 --> 49:59.788
Hi, everybody, from my parents.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.207
Dad, you'll give me a dance lesson
when I come.

50:02.290 --> 50:03.166
Okay.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.544
-Goodbye!
-Bye!

50:06.378 --> 50:07.421
Look at this.

50:09.965 --> 50:10.966
Mm.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.433
[Phil] It's my last day
in this incredible city,

50:19.516 --> 50:21.268
and there's one last thing before I go.

50:22.644 --> 50:25.814
Julián is having a barbeque at his house.

50:25.897 --> 50:27.774
A real Argentinian asado.

50:27.858 --> 50:30.610
-I see all the greatest hits.
-Chinchulines.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.821
And the greatest hits of my trip
are here too.

50:32.904 --> 50:37.534
Many of the friends I've met,
like Gonzalo, Rodolfo, Donato, Allie.

50:38.285 --> 50:39.119
Hello, Allie.

50:39.202 --> 50:41.413
And even my tango teacher, Cecilia.

50:41.496 --> 50:44.374
I'm excited to see them
one more time and say goodbye.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.335
Not goodbye, farewell,
because I want to come back.

50:47.419 --> 50:48.712
-Do you tango?
-No.

50:48.795 --> 50:50.422
-[Phil] Never?
-No.

50:50.505 --> 50:52.215
I know someone who gives lessons.

50:52.299 --> 50:53.175
[all laugh]

50:53.258 --> 50:54.718
-[Donato] Your next agent.
-Yes.

50:54.801 --> 50:56.553
-I make an ad for you.
-Great! Let's do it!

50:56.636 --> 51:00.807
Look, he touch her again and she's like,
"Oh, really?" How could you do that?

51:00.891 --> 51:01.892
We do this one.

51:02.309 --> 51:03.518
[chuckles]

51:05.145 --> 51:06.897
[chattering]

51:06.980 --> 51:08.356
[Donato] Oh!

51:08.440 --> 51:10.067
[Julián] Chinchulines y riñones.

51:10.567 --> 51:12.277
-Chinchulines.
-Chinchulines. Yes!

51:12.360 --> 51:14.279
[Gonzalo] It's stomach...

51:14.362 --> 51:15.197
Don't tell me.

51:20.660 --> 51:21.578
[Phil] Look at that.

51:24.247 --> 51:25.582
You don't do a lot of chicken.

51:25.665 --> 51:26.833
[Gonzalo] Chicken is not meat.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.001
[laughs]

51:28.085 --> 51:29.169
You know?

51:29.252 --> 51:31.379
[Phil] I love how it's coming
like in courses.

51:31.463 --> 51:32.964
[Phil] It's how it works.

51:33.048 --> 51:34.800
It's never all at the same time.

51:34.883 --> 51:39.846
A true asado day for example starts
at 12 pm and finishes at 2 am.

51:40.013 --> 51:42.390
Twelve hours for asados.

51:42.474 --> 51:45.393
It's about drinking.
It's about talking and chatting.

51:45.477 --> 51:50.232
You start with asado,
and then you start another asado.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.317
And you continue.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.445
I can speak as a foreigner,
this is wonderful. But sometimes--

51:55.529 --> 51:57.239
-Be careful.
-[Donato] No, no. No.

51:57.322 --> 51:59.699
-Takes too long to get to the good meat.
-No, never.

51:59.783 --> 52:02.494
Never an asado take too long. Never.

52:02.577 --> 52:04.287
-No, it takes--
-You are not from Argentina

52:04.371 --> 52:05.914
-because you believe that.
-[laughs]

52:05.997 --> 52:10.669
You are from Italy!
An asado never take too long.

52:11.628 --> 52:13.505
[Julián] Sorry, guys.
I need to interrupt you.

52:13.588 --> 52:15.507
[all] Oh!

52:15.590 --> 52:17.008
[Donato] Now we're talking!

52:19.427 --> 52:20.595
[Phil and Julián] Jugoso.

52:22.764 --> 52:25.225
Here. A lot of chimichurri.

52:25.308 --> 52:26.434
[all laugh]

52:26.518 --> 52:28.436
I have a little present for Phil.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.147
[Gonzalo laughs]

52:31.022 --> 52:32.482
A million dollar, baby.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.818
[man speaking Spanish]

52:37.779 --> 52:41.658
-These are the napkins from La Mezzetta.
-[all laugh]

52:43.994 --> 52:45.245
[Gonzalo] That's even worse.

52:45.328 --> 52:46.913
I want everyone to have one.

52:46.997 --> 52:49.416
Oh, did you get
a little schmootz on yourself?

52:49.499 --> 52:51.501
You need a napkin. Here's your napkin.

52:51.585 --> 52:52.794
-Thank you!
-[Phil] Try it.

52:53.336 --> 52:55.130
-This is your napkin.
-[all laugh]

52:55.213 --> 52:56.047
Oh, you.

52:56.131 --> 52:57.340
[Allie] Oh, I know about these.

52:57.424 --> 52:59.968
She wrote a whole poem
about these napkins.

53:01.261 --> 53:02.179
All right.

53:04.139 --> 53:06.808
I treasure this.
I'm bringing this home--

53:06.892 --> 53:09.269
I give you a lot.
Give it to everyone in the U.S.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.146
[Donato] Cheers.

53:12.230 --> 53:13.773
[all laugh]

53:13.857 --> 53:16.526
[Phil] Buenos Aires sounds
