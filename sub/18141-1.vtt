WEBVTT

02:15.750 --> 02:17.667
Thanks, mrs p.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.750
You're a fine one, Jack, waking me up.
You know I'm on nights.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.000
Just a sec.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.333
Yeah, okay, the chequers, then?

02:30.583 --> 02:33.500
Yes, I heard... the flat parcel,
back of your wardrobe.

02:33.625 --> 02:35.250
Yeah, I'll find it. Hm.

02:35.375 --> 02:38.125
Look, don't waste
time talking. Yep, bye.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.207
(Police officer) Er, mrs pascoe?
—(Mrs pascoe) Yes?

03:14.292 --> 03:18.372
(Police officer) Er, we're police officers. We'd like
a word about your lodger, Barrett — Jack Barrett.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.375
(Mrs pascoe)
Oh. Won't you come in, please?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.250
(Police officer) Thank you.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.250
(Com drops)

03:35.333 --> 03:36.917
Oh, mr melville farr's chambers?

03:37.458 --> 03:39.708
Can I speak to mr farr, please?

03:39.792 --> 03:43.208
Mm? Oh, Barrett; Jack Barrett.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.667
Oh, thank you.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.125
He's quite a giant—killer,
this major humphries.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.643
How long's he been running his head
against this particular brick wall?

03:50.667 --> 03:55.917
Three years, mr farr; Ever since the rural district council
designated his land for acquisition as a housing estate.

03:56.042 --> 03:57.583
Well, he's in the right, you know.

03:57.958 --> 04:00.792
It's beyond their powers
under the '57 housing act.

04:01.167 --> 04:02.958
He's strangled in red tape.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.375
Do you think we
should take it on, sir?

04:05.458 --> 04:07.458
The major's funds must
be running a bit low.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.417
- —Who are his solicitors?
- Hambury and wilcox.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.292
I'd let them worry about
that if I were you.

04:11.375 --> 04:14.518
The point is, the major's right, the ministry's
wrong, and I should like to make them squirm.

04:14.542 --> 04:15.750
(Buzzer)

04:15.833 --> 04:18.833
-(Farr) Hello. —mr Jack Barrett for
you, mr farr. He says it's very urgent.

04:21.708 --> 04:26.708
All right, William... er, telephone major humphries'
solicitors; Arrange a meeting some time next week.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.458
Very good, sir.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.250
Put him through.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.750
Barrett?

04:39.917 --> 04:42.250
If I hear from you again,
I shall inform the police.

04:42.375 --> 04:43.958
Do you understand?

04:44.042 --> 04:46.125
That's absolutely final.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.792
Boy's a bit exclusive today, isn't he?

05:18.917 --> 05:21.125
Yes, he doesn't look any too happy.

05:21.542 --> 05:23.208
Is that Barrett coming back?

05:23.250 --> 05:24.625
Yes.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.958
You'd hear a pin
fall on a feather, ph.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.458
Compensation for dead eyes, dear boy.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.417
Two thousand pounds...?

05:32.458 --> 05:34.125
Two thousand three hundred.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.708
All right. But what're you gonna do?

05:37.458 --> 05:40.083
Did the police come?
—yes. I had to nip out pretty smartish.

05:40.125 --> 05:41.292
Did you get the parcel?

05:41.333 --> 05:43.292
Yes, it's in your bag, under here.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.917
The point is, what're you gonna do?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.458
Oh, I don't know.

05:46.583 --> 05:49.125
Now, look, just go to a
cinema; Sit it out till it's dark.

05:49.167 --> 05:50.542
No, no...

05:50.667 --> 05:52.208
(Eddy) Well, what, then?

05:52.375 --> 05:54.226
Well, better you don't know,
then you can't tell 'em.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.833
I wouldn't give you away.

05:56.042 --> 05:57.708
(Sighs)
They'd twist it out of you.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.500
No, they— they wouldn't, mate, look...

05:59.625 --> 06:01.292
I'll be all right, now, eddy.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.167
Thanks for bringing the parcel.
No, no, you stay and finish my beer.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.083
Well, watch yourself, now.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.625
Yeah.

06:25.083 --> 06:26.708
What's the matter with boy, eddy?

06:27.167 --> 06:28.625
Oh, he's all right.

06:49.417 --> 06:50.750
Did you get Barrett?

06:50.792 --> 06:52.125
No, sir.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.417
Gave us the slip. Sorry, sir.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.958
'Sorry' never arrested anyone, sergeant.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.625
No, sir.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.167
Find anything in his room?

07:01.292 --> 07:02.692
(Bridie)
Nothing worth a penny, sir.

07:02.833 --> 07:05.708
Clean, tidy, very bare.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.167
(Bridie)
I had a talk with the landlady.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.958
Boy never went anywhere.
Hardly a shirt to his name...

07:11.042 --> 07:13.000
Lived out of tins in his room.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.500
This has a familiar ring, bridie.

07:15.542 --> 07:16.833
Yes, sir.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.643
And when you bring him in,
we shall find the answer.

07:18.667 --> 07:19.750
Send out a general alert.

07:19.792 --> 07:21.208
Yes, sir.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.792
Get on with it, bridie.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.208
(Bridie) Yes, sir.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.792
Hello, farr. I was hoping
I might bump into you.

07:36.875 --> 07:37.958
Oh, yes?

07:38.083 --> 07:40.083
It's about this charity
subscription I'm running...

07:40.167 --> 07:43.559
Charles, you've made a fortune for your shareholders.
Why don't you ask them to stump up a bit?

07:43.583 --> 07:46.292
I've tried, my dear fellow,
but they're most unco-operative!

07:46.792 --> 07:49.208
- Hello, mandrake.
- Charles. Hello, farr.

07:49.250 --> 07:53.958
I've seen your exhibition. Congratulations. I thought
the industrial photographs were absolutely splendid.

07:54.042 --> 07:55.625
Thank you.
—have you seen his show?

07:55.708 --> 07:57.976
- No, I haven't.
- —well, you should, it really is excellent.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.417
Excuse me, m'lord —
Telephone call for you, sir.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.250
- Who is it?
- Mr Barrett.

08:02.417 --> 08:04.792
Oh — not in, Thompson.
Want a drink before lunch?

08:04.833 --> 08:08.033
Mm. Better let me get them. You'll need all
your money for Charles' subscription.

08:23.875 --> 08:25.583
So you've turned up again, boy.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.667
Hello, miss benham. I want
to see mr Doe. Is he in?

08:28.958 --> 08:30.375
I'll see.

08:34.832 --> 08:37.417
So, the prodigal's returned, miss benham!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.792
Looked us up again, eh?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.542
Can I speak to you?

08:41.582 --> 08:43.292
Shall I say 'yes'?

08:43.375 --> 08:44.958
Or shall I say 'no'?

08:45.042 --> 08:46.458
Please, Harold.

08:46.583 --> 08:50.375
All right. I don't hold malice. Let's see
what you've got to say. Come along.

08:51.375 --> 08:52.792
(Doe) Why aren't you working?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.917
- —Got the afternoon off.
- Very nice.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.958
(Doe)
I'm just going to make a cup of tea.

08:57.042 --> 08:59.362
Harold, I want you to promise
me something. It's important.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.083
Promise?

09:01.458 --> 09:05.042
Well, it's waited six months.
Surely it can wait a little longer?

09:05.250 --> 09:07.417
No, it can't — it's got to be now!

09:08.333 --> 09:09.583
Now?

09:10.500 --> 09:12.208
Are you dictating to me?

09:12.417 --> 09:14.583
Harold, listen, please...

09:17.083 --> 09:19.167
I said 'please' once, boy.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.417
It didn't have much effect... did it?

09:22.458 --> 09:24.167
But, this is different.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.625
Oh, I see.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.627
You've got to promise me
you'll never tell anyone.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.167
'Tell'?

09:29.417 --> 09:30.958
Have I got anything to tell?

09:32.083 --> 09:35.375
Well, yes... you remember,
back last spring...

09:36.292 --> 09:38.375
When I... when I left...

09:38.917 --> 09:40.417
Oh, that.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.458
Oh, well, there's no fun in gossip
unless you can mention names.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.833
And you never did, did you?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.875
Not that secrets don't have
a horrid way of leaking out.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.958
Did you find out the name, Harold?

09:54.042 --> 09:56.208
Did you? I must know!

09:56.250 --> 09:59.250
What do you mean, 'must'? I don't
think I'm going to tell you.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.667
Just sweat it out.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.708
I know what horrid imaginings are.
Now you're going to have your share.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.375
You look at me as if you hate me.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.667
That's a very good guess.

10:14.042 --> 10:15.917
For god's sake, get out!

10:23.792 --> 10:26.000
(Doe)
Come back when I'm in a better temper!

11:00.417 --> 11:02.750
No, I'm sorry, mr Barrett,
mr farr has left.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.458
No, I haven't seen him since lunch.

11:14.292 --> 11:17.833
(Charles) ...Yes, I agree, but by
inclination we're all individualists.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.958
Every man wants to
own his own business.

11:20.458 --> 11:24.258
But the pressure of modern commerce is gradually
pushing the independent trades out of business.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.125
(His voice fades) Now, my plan
is to let them keep their autonomy,

11:27.583 --> 11:32.917
but at the same time have all the advantages the
combines enjoy, through an associated purchasing company.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.417
You haven't heard a damn
word I've been saying.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.875
Yes, yes, I have... it's a fine plan.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.792
It'll help a lot of people.

11:40.833 --> 11:44.233
You only heard because you're trained to
listen with one ear, and look with the other.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.583
You really care about
people, don't you?

11:48.083 --> 11:50.375
Yes... yes, of course I do.

12:03.292 --> 12:06.792
(Knocking)

12:25.083 --> 12:27.625
Sorry phip, I know you don't like
people coming to the showroom.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.018
Not me, old mate — the powers
that be aren't keen on social calls.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.750
Phip, can you drive
me out of London?

12:32.542 --> 12:35.333
Sorry, sport... couldn't have
come at a worse time.

12:35.417 --> 12:38.309
I'm, er, I'm scheduled to deliver a crate
out at, er, Richmond when I'm finished here.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.708
Where do you want to go?

12:39.792 --> 12:41.292
Kelworth, new town.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.250
Well, flag a lift from a lorry?

12:43.458 --> 12:44.875
Be all right.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.167
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be all right.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.708
(Mrs Brooks)
Good evening, mr farr.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.333
Evening, mrs Brooks. My wife home?

13:02.375 --> 13:04.167
She's not back from the clinic yet.
—oh.

13:04.292 --> 13:06.000
- —Her brother's here.
- Oh, good.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.583
(Scott) Ah, there you are, Mel.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.500
Hello, Scott, how are you?
Nice to see you.

13:09.542 --> 13:12.625
Felt a bit lonely. Ronnie
went back to school today.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.792
Never mind — only ten weeks till easter.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.583
(Farr) Come and have a drink.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.167
What's all this about clinics?
Laura having trouble?

13:19.292 --> 13:23.833
No, no — only of her own making. She's taken a
spare-time job, working with difficult children.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.583
Apparently, she's rather good at it.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.888
If you go into court with that rubbish
it'll do your client no good.

13:36.042 --> 13:41.708
Brent's wife will get costs, custody and alimony,
which is exactly what she wants... selfish bitch.

13:42.542 --> 13:47.208
No, I—I— I'd plead discretion; Place the whole
of her life on the bench in front of the judge.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.792
Harry Brent won't do that.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.351
Then, I should tell him to find somebody
else to lose the case for him.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.417
- —You would, too!
- Yeah, damn right I would.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.750
(Laura — from hall) Mel?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.500
Yes, in here, darling.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.590
- —Hello, darling. Hello, Scott.
- Hello, love.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.893
(Farr)
And how were the little idiots today?

14:00.917 --> 14:02.625
It's not a lunatic asylum!

14:02.708 --> 14:04.625
- Oh, isn't it? I thought it was.
- Very funny.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.250
Did you get Ronnie off all right?

14:06.375 --> 14:07.875
Yes... miserable.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.597
Why don't you stay and
have dinner with us?

14:09.625 --> 14:12.458
Can't, thanks — I'm just off.
I've got a lot of work tonight.

14:12.917 --> 14:15.125
The Campbell brief fell
into my lap last week.

14:15.292 --> 14:18.167
Lord knows why they call
it a 'brief'... it never is.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.958
What will you do about dinner?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.184
-Oh, don't worry, I've got some
stuff in the fridge. —are you sure?

14:24.208 --> 14:25.625
Yes, of course.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.917
- All right. Good night.
- Night, night.

14:32.083 --> 14:33.708
Take care of each other.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.542
- —Good night.
- 'Night.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.708
(Laura) I worry about Scott, living on his
own with Ronnie to bring up.

14:41.958 --> 14:44.042
He seems lost since Helen died.

14:45.042 --> 14:48.000
I think he ought to get married again.
Ronnie needs a mother.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.917
Why don't you tell him? You're his sister.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.500
I have. He doesn't seem to want to.

14:52.583 --> 14:54.292
Perhaps he's not in love with anybody.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.917
Well, he ought to be.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.250
That's typical feminine logic.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.250
Do you love me?

15:02.292 --> 15:05.000
Yes... yes, I do.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.875
A little reassurance helps.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.417
(Chuckles) Come on.

15:30.917 --> 15:32.583
Thanks a lot.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.250
Frank... frank!

15:57.375 --> 15:59.500
Hey, frank! Wait!

16:00.958 --> 16:02.083
Hi, frank.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.875
- —Hello, Jack.
- Hi, sylvie.

16:04.292 --> 16:05.542
Here.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.250
- (Frank) What?
- In here!

16:12.792 --> 16:14.417
Where have you sprung from, Jack?

16:14.458 --> 16:16.393
I want to get down to the coast.
—what's stopping you?

16:16.417 --> 16:19.292
Sylvie... if Jack wants to shake
down for the night, he's welcome.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.875
No. I told you last time he came
I wouldn't have him anymore.

16:21.917 --> 16:24.184
(Frank) You're not going to stop me
having who I like in my own house.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.667
Don't quarrel over me — please...

16:25.708 --> 16:27.375
- —He's staying, sylvie.
- Not with us.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.208
Why can't he stick with his own sort?

16:29.458 --> 16:32.208
You can come home, frank jeffries,
when you've got rid of him.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.792
I— I never knew sylvie
felt like that about me.

16:37.875 --> 16:40.083
- —What's up, Jack?
- I'm in terrible trouble, frank.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.458
Can I help?
—I've got to get out of the country.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.750
I can buy a job as a steward on a
ship if I can get to southampton.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.542
I need twenty quid, though.

16:48.833 --> 16:52.458
I haven't got it tonight, but... I'll wire
it to you, first thing in the morning.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.333
-Will you? —of course I will.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.792
(Sighs) Thanks a lot, frank.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.333
- Er, I— I'm sorry about...
- Ah, no, no, no, no...

16:59.417 --> 17:00.750
I'll... say goodbye, then.

17:00.792 --> 17:03.917
No, no, I'll walk with
you to the coast road.

17:04.041 --> 17:06.291
Get it off your chest.
It'll do you good.

17:07.708 --> 17:11.166
Well, if that's the way of it...
You're in a hell of a mess.

17:12.375 --> 17:14.166
Have you told me everything?

17:14.250 --> 17:16.708
Everything. Now do you
understand why I took the money?

17:16.791 --> 17:18.083
Of course.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.166
I wish you'd stay and face the music.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.601
- No...
- —I'd go to the police with you...

17:22.625 --> 17:25.250
No, they'd twist hell out of me!
Make me say why I took it.

17:25.291 --> 17:28.332
- —Well, it's bound to come out in the end...
- Look — I know what I'm doing.

17:28.625 --> 17:33.250
I'll be off now, frank. I'll soon
catch a lift. Goodbye, and thanks.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.333
What, for a measly twenty quid?

17:35.417 --> 17:39.083
No, for knowing me all these years...
And still being a friend.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.292
Well, it used to be witches.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.375
At least they don't burn you.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.000
Good luck, Jack.

17:57.292 --> 17:59.792
You'll never forgive me, will you?

18:00.125 --> 18:02.559
It's not your fault you haven't got
enough brains to understand.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.208
Oh, you have, I suppose?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.875
I feel sorry for him, that's all.

18:05.958 --> 18:07.917
-Sorry, for that? —yes.

18:08.958 --> 18:10.917
Jack used to talk to me.

18:11.792 --> 18:14.125
He's very lonely, deep inside...

18:15.583 --> 18:17.833
Hasn't got what you
and I have got, sylvie.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.542
(Telephone rings)

18:32.458 --> 18:33.792
Hello?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.375
No, this is mrs farr speaking.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.875
What name?

18:39.125 --> 18:40.583
Barrett?

18:40.792 --> 18:42.750
Well, where's he calling from?

18:43.958 --> 18:45.833
Oh, very well, I'll accept the call.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.458
(Operator) Go ahead, caller.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.125
Mr farr?

18:51.542 --> 18:53.958
Barrett; Jack Barrett.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.000
It's urgent.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.958
I'll call again at... eight in the morning.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.583
Oh, all right, I'll... I'll
give him a message.

19:30.625 --> 19:33.375
Hello. I thought you'd gone to bed.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.167
I had, but I heard the telephone.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.583
Oh, was it someone for me?

19:36.625 --> 19:39.500
A young man, Barrett. He was
'phoning from kelworth.

19:39.625 --> 19:42.375
He reversed the charge, so I
thought I ought to accept the call.

19:42.708 --> 19:44.708
What did he want?

19:44.833 --> 19:47.073
He'll 'phone again tomorrow
morning, about eight o'clock.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.333
He sounded quite desperate.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.833
This Barrett; Is it a case?

19:54.292 --> 19:56.083
It is now.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.167
Never mind... let's go up.

21:47.458 --> 21:50.418
(Inspector Harris) During the last seven
months in your job as wages clerk,

21:50.458 --> 21:52.917
you've been drawing the salaries
of five fictitious workmen.

21:53.583 --> 21:57.208
All told, you've appropriated around
two thousand, three hundred pounds.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.125
Where is it?

21:59.375 --> 22:02.136
You've opened a bank account, a
post office savings book, haven't you?

22:02.208 --> 22:03.583
What name did you give?

22:03.625 --> 22:05.500
Isn't it enough that I
said I took the money?

22:05.542 --> 22:07.542
- —Your employers want it back.
- Where is it?

22:07.583 --> 22:09.708
Er... I've... I've spent it.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.250
What on, son?

22:12.292 --> 22:14.250
There's nothing new in your wardrobe.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.500
You live cheaply... eat cheaply...

22:17.625 --> 22:19.143
Who's been putting the squeeze on you?

22:19.167 --> 22:20.542
Come on, open up!

22:20.625 --> 22:22.385
We don't like blackmail
any more than you do.

22:22.625 --> 22:24.708
Look, I took the money...

22:24.875 --> 22:27.375
I stole it, and I spent it! That's all.

22:27.667 --> 22:30.167
We mean to find out what's
behind this, Barrett.

22:30.375 --> 22:34.083
You've got yourself in a real jam, son. Look,
far better come clean and then we can help you.

22:35.542 --> 22:38.000
Och, we're wasting our time, sir.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.125
All right, Barrett. Let's see what a
little solitary contemplation will do.

22:41.917 --> 22:44.667
Get in a sensible frame of mind.
We'll talk to you again later.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.042
Right, off you go.

22:46.125 --> 22:47.458
(Bridie) Mac!

22:49.375 --> 22:51.250
Put him down.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.083
That boy's not a thief.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.792
More victim than criminal,
if my supposition is right.

22:59.667 --> 23:03.833
I'm always worried, sir, when I find myself
allowing the motive to mitigate the crime.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.208
Yes... our jobs would be much easier if we just
had to deal with the bill Sykes of this world.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.125
(Knock at door)

23:10.500 --> 23:12.167
Come in.

23:14.917 --> 23:18.958
The stuff they took from the drain is a
scrapbook, sir, now we've got it pieced together.

23:39.625 --> 23:42.208
You haven't eaten your dinner.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.750
(Sergeant)
Must stoke up, you know.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.583
What's gonna happen to me?

23:48.667 --> 23:51.167
They'll talk to you again later,
when you've had a rest.

23:51.292 --> 23:53.083
Why don't you sleep a bit?

23:53.292 --> 23:55.292
Put your feet up.

23:55.583 --> 24:00.750
That's right. Rest. Shut your
eyes. Sort out your answers.

24:00.833 --> 24:04.333
You'll have to tell the truth in the end.
May as well make up your mind to it.

24:34.500 --> 24:38.125
Fulham police station have been on the
telephone, sir; A detective inspector Harris.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.625
(Farr) Well?

24:39.708 --> 24:41.250
He'd like you to drop in, sir.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.500
Well, it's on my way home.
What about?

24:43.542 --> 24:47.542
The inspector didn't say, sir, but I got the
impression it was a matter of some importance.

24:47.958 --> 24:50.167
Telephone my wife, will you?

24:50.292 --> 24:52.208
- Tell her I'll be a bit late.
- —yes, sir.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.375
And there's another thing. —oh?

24:54.458 --> 24:56.417
A letter from the lord chancellor's office.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.542
Don't tell me we've been turned down?

24:58.583 --> 25:02.042
Hardly, sir. Our friends think you
should've taken silk some time ago.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.458
Being a qc can be a
risky business, William.

25:04.542 --> 25:07.542
Many a good junior practice has
failed being in the front row.

25:07.667 --> 25:11.792
I'm not worried about that, sir. I'm
sure we shall be quite at home there.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.542
Well, I'm glad you think so.

25:21.125 --> 25:23.000
(Farr) These have been in water.

25:23.292 --> 25:25.612
(Harris) Yes. The boy tried
desperately to get rid of them.

25:25.833 --> 25:27.667
(Harris)
We had to have the drain up.

25:28.042 --> 25:32.000
Newspaper cuttings... pictures
carefully preserved in a scrapbook...

25:32.167 --> 25:34.708
And all pertaining to
you and your career, sir.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.833
Do you know Barrett?

25:37.875 --> 25:40.083
Yes, I met him some time ago.

25:40.167 --> 25:44.500
He, er... he thumbed a lift one night; Said
he'd missed the last bus to Fulham.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.750
It was on my way home,
so I, er, dropped him off.

25:48.417 --> 25:50.458
- (Harris) Did you see him again?
- —yes.

25:50.958 --> 25:53.750
He was working on a building
site quite near my chambers.

25:53.917 --> 25:58.375
I often used to see him standing down there at the
traffic lights — the strand—waterloo intersection.

25:59.833 --> 26:03.625
It seemed churlish not to give him
a lift now and again, so... I did.

26:05.167 --> 26:06.750
Then I stopped.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.250
Oh? Why did you do that, sir?

26:11.375 --> 26:15.625
I came to the conclusion that he was waiting
for me. Wet or fine, he was always there.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.500
I see.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.292
So that was the end of it?

26:21.458 --> 26:24.833
No, he, er... he started
writing... telephoning.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.583
I destroyed his letters...
Warned him not to call.

26:29.667 --> 26:32.500
We believe that Barrett
was being blackmailed, sir.

26:35.333 --> 26:38.833
He's been stealing from his firm for
months; Over two thousand pounds.

26:39.125 --> 26:43.542
There's nothing to show for it. He had less than
half a dollar in his pocket when we picked him up.

26:45.042 --> 26:48.625
Did he give you any hint, any impression,
that he was being blackmailed?

26:51.667 --> 26:53.792
Then this started after
you finished seeing him?

26:54.833 --> 26:56.833
It would seem that way.

26:56.958 --> 27:00.000
Have you any idea what Barrett might
have been paying to keep quiet?

27:00.083 --> 27:01.750
No idea at all.

27:01.792 --> 27:04.250
Er, you knew, of course,
that he was a homosexual?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.125
I had formed that impression.

27:07.292 --> 27:11.875
You know, also, sir, that as many as ninety percent
of all blackmail cases have a homosexual origin?

27:12.833 --> 27:14.917
I follow your train of thought, inspector.

27:15.083 --> 27:17.523
But I wouldn't know if it applied
in this particular instance.

27:17.792 --> 27:19.958
You can't hazard a guess, sir?

27:21.750 --> 27:27.333
Well, there's no doubt that a law which sends homosexuals
to prison offers unlimited opportunities for blackmail.

27:28.167 --> 27:30.333
Well, thank you, sir. You've
been extremely helpful.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.167
Thank you.

27:33.542 --> 27:37.250
Do you, erm... do you have
any line on the blackmailer?

27:37.500 --> 27:40.708
No, sir. We couldn't get a word
out of Barrett, which is a pity.

27:40.958 --> 27:45.583
Blackmail's the simplest of crimes when we have the
co-operation of the victim; Almost impossible when we haven't.

27:47.250 --> 27:50.625
Can I, er... can I see Barrett?

27:51.167 --> 27:53.083
I'd like to talk to him.

27:53.167 --> 27:54.917
That's not possible, sir.

27:55.167 --> 27:57.208
Barrett hanged himself
in his cell this afternoon.

27:58.083 --> 27:59.792
He's dead.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.792
Well, I'm sorry to have kept
you waiting, mr stone.

28:13.917 --> 28:16.625
The inspector's free now —
I'll take you up in a moment.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.167
Thanks.

28:18.292 --> 28:20.083
This way, mr farr.

28:27.958 --> 28:32.333
That was eddy stone, sir. We
fetched him to identify the body.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.500
Stone?

28:34.542 --> 28:39.083
He works as a ticket clerk at twofosters
tube station. Friend of Barrett's.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.750
Good night, sir.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.917
Did you know your friend
was being blackmailed?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.458
No. I just thought
he was brassed off.

29:25.625 --> 29:28.792
How well did Barrett
know mr melville farr?

29:29.500 --> 29:31.000
Who?

29:31.083 --> 29:33.375
The gentleman I was with
when I saw you in the hall.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.083
I— I don't know. I've
never seen him before.

29:36.167 --> 29:39.458
Boy didn't mention anyone
called 'farr' to me.

29:39.542 --> 29:40.875
I see.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.958
Your friend was very secretive.

29:45.042 --> 29:47.375
Didn't he confide in you?

29:47.458 --> 29:50.208
No. Why should he?

29:51.875 --> 29:53.625
Look, can I go now?

29:53.667 --> 29:55.750
I don't see why not.

29:57.958 --> 30:01.792
If you do decide to remember
anything Barrett said, let us know.

30:03.208 --> 30:05.458
Blackmail's a serious business.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.667
So's murder.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.875
He's right. This blackmailer as
good as murdered Barrett.

30:12.958 --> 30:15.542
I want him before he
does any more damage.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.042
Did farr recognise him downstairs?

30:18.375 --> 30:19.750
No, sir.

30:19.875 --> 30:23.750
Nevertheless, whatever the blackmailer had on
Barrett concerned farr; Of that I'm certain.

30:23.875 --> 30:26.083
But mr farr's married, sir.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.583
That was our famous last words, bridie.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.333
He took Barrett into his car...

30:32.667 --> 30:34.625
No harm in giving the boy a lift.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.125
Maybe not. It's the subsequent
lifts that worry me.

30:38.417 --> 30:41.750
Check on Barrett's background.
Find out if there are any relations.

30:41.833 --> 30:44.250
And tell sergeant hoey
to get his Sunday suit.

30:44.333 --> 30:45.708
Very good, sir.

30:45.750 --> 30:48.101
If only these unfortunate devils
would come to us in the first place

30:48.125 --> 30:51.167
if only they led normal lives,
they wouldn't need to come at all.

30:51.875 --> 30:55.583
If the law punished every abnormality
we'd be kept pretty busy, son.

30:55.625 --> 30:58.750
Even so, sir, this law was
made for a very good reason.

30:58.792 --> 31:02.042
If it were changed, other
weaknesses would follow.

31:02.250 --> 31:05.000
I can see you're a
true puritan, bridie, eh?

31:05.042 --> 31:07.333
Well, there's nothing wrong with that, sir.

31:07.583 --> 31:11.542
Of course not. But there was a time
when that was against the law, you know.

31:11.625 --> 31:13.458
Ah... very good, sir.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.208
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hello darling.

31:19.167 --> 31:22.250
Sorry I'm late... did, er,
did William telephone you?

31:22.458 --> 31:26.625
Yes — he said you had some marvellous
news! He could hardly contain himself.

31:26.792 --> 31:32.417
'Marvellous news'... oh, yes, er, the lord
chancellor accepted my application.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.042
That's wonderful! We must celebrate.

31:36.875 --> 31:40.375
I don't very much feel like celebrating
tonight, if you don't mind.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.750
Mel, are you all right?
Is something wrong?

31:42.833 --> 31:45.625
William said you were so pleased;
What happened on the way home?

31:47.917 --> 31:52.375
He said you had to go to Fulham police
station. Were you in an accident, or something?

31:52.583 --> 31:55.292
No, no... I'm all right.

31:56.417 --> 31:58.000
I'm sorry.

31:59.958 --> 32:01.958
I'll go and run your bath.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.917
(Mrs pascoe) Is that you, eddy?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.458
Who else?

32:24.208 --> 32:25.667
Here's your milk.

32:25.708 --> 32:28.268
(Mrs pascoe) Thanks. And there's
some letters by the phone for you.

32:28.292 --> 32:29.625
When did they come?

32:29.708 --> 32:32.458
(Mrs pascoe) Monday or Tuesday.
Took 'em in with mine — I forgot.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.500
I hear farr's taking silk?

33:23.542 --> 33:26.958
That's right. Qc at forty.
There's no stopping the blighter.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.125
We'll see him on the bench yet.

33:29.250 --> 33:32.417
Well, he's got a big enough practice.
He'll be able to afford it.

33:39.125 --> 33:40.750
(Eddy) Mr farr?

33:41.958 --> 33:43.542
What do you want?

33:43.625 --> 33:44.917
I want to talk to you.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.542
I only see people by appointment.

33:46.583 --> 33:48.458
I think you ought to
see this photograph.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.833
(Eddy) That's what boy was
paying to keep quiet... you and 'im.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.333
I just found it.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.917
You'd better come upstairs.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.417
- Morning, mr farr.
- Morning, William.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.101
If there are any calls, you take them.
I don't want to be disturbed.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.917
Yes, sir. We're in court this morning, sir.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.792
Yes, I know we are.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.375
Well, it's clear enough now.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.542
Boy stole all that money
to pay for the negative.

34:25.792 --> 34:29.042
But the bastards never sent it —
Just another print, as a reminder.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.625
How, er...

34:34.292 --> 34:36.250
How could they have taken this?

34:36.375 --> 34:38.250
They were obviously trailing boy.

34:38.792 --> 34:41.625
Telephoto lens. It's an old dodge.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.417
(Eddy) You were in the car,
you wouldn't ever see them.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.042
Have you shown this to the police?

34:48.583 --> 34:50.833
Well, of course I haven't!

34:51.000 --> 34:53.167
That's what he was trying to prevent.

34:53.333 --> 34:54.833
Don't you see?

34:55.500 --> 34:57.375
Yes, I see.

34:58.458 --> 34:59.750
Isee...

35:02.167 --> 35:04.167
Why did he have to go and...

35:04.333 --> 35:05.833
Hang himself?

35:06.333 --> 35:08.625
He knew the police would get
it out of him in the end.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.833
He didn't want to involve you.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.750
You'll be all right.

35:13.833 --> 35:15.333
(Farr) Yes.

35:15.375 --> 35:19.167
He should've come to you. He wasn't
big enough to be on his own like that.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.042
He should've come to you...

35:25.583 --> 35:27.042
He did.

35:29.250 --> 35:31.583
I thought he was trying to blackmail me.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.875
I wouldn't even talk to him.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.833
Jesus“.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.750
Poor old boy.

35:43.125 --> 35:46.042
He didn't stand much of a chance
between you and the blacky, did he?

35:53.708 --> 35:55.708
Well, I'd better go.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.434
(Eddy)
I... I just thought you'd want to know.

35:57.458 --> 35:58.875
No, stone, wait a minute.

36:01.375 --> 36:03.667
Do you know who was blackmailing him?

36:05.167 --> 36:07.458
Well, I'm going to find out.

36:07.542 --> 36:09.125
And you're going to help me.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.875
(Eddy)
What for? They'll pack it in now...

36:12.250 --> 36:13.958
(Eddy) Now that he's dead.

36:14.125 --> 36:17.434
I mean, they're scared of tackling you,
otherwise they'd have done it in the first place.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.375
Why go looking for trouble?

36:19.542 --> 36:23.708
If I hadn't been trying so bloody hard to
avoid trouble, this might never had happened.

36:24.667 --> 36:27.667
But it has. And they're not
going to get away with it.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.250
Well, if you dig this over it could
end in one hell of a scandal.

36:31.458 --> 36:33.625
And it wouldn't only be
you who came down.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.542
I know that.

36:36.375 --> 36:39.292
I... I can't help you.
I don't know anything.

36:39.458 --> 36:44.000
You don't have to know anything. All you
have to do is to watch; Watch for fear.

36:44.958 --> 36:47.625
Fear is the oxygen of blackmail.

36:47.792 --> 36:50.917
Barrett was paying,
others are. Find me one.

36:51.458 --> 36:54.125
You're crazy, mr farr...
You're not thinking...

36:54.167 --> 36:55.958
Stone, are you going to help me, or not?

36:56.333 --> 36:58.583
Okay. I'll listen around.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.375
I'd like to get 'em, too.

37:02.083 --> 37:06.167
Just remember, if you do run 'em down...
You'll bring yourself down as well.

37:07.167 --> 37:09.000
Call me here.

37:09.292 --> 37:11.042
I'll call you.

37:26.083 --> 37:29.000
It should be there first thing
in the morning, ph. —good.

37:34.583 --> 37:37.083
There they go, ph... homing pigeons.

37:37.125 --> 37:39.375
I hope they come back with
their little beaks bulging.

37:39.583 --> 37:44.375
Let's have a Sherry at the chequers. I love to hear
the chat. They'll all be talking about boy Barrett.

37:44.458 --> 37:46.500
Who'd have thought he'd go
and do a thing like that?

37:46.542 --> 37:47.708
Who would?

37:47.750 --> 37:50.125
It's shaken me, ph. I wish we
could go back to cheltenham.

37:50.167 --> 37:52.667
Just a while longer, Mickey.
We'll wind it up soon.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.250
We cross now, don't we? —yes.

38:08.667 --> 38:11.208
I'm ready to go to
the post, mr Doe.

38:12.208 --> 38:13.833
Mr Doe.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.833
I'm ready to go to the post.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.083
Boy's dead.

38:21.958 --> 38:23.708
He hanged himself.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.208
It's in the paper.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.708
I must go to the post.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.708
Will you please come in the shop?

38:37.333 --> 38:38.875
Close the shop.

38:40.042 --> 38:41.958
Pull down the blinds.

38:44.042 --> 38:45.833
Miss benham...

38:46.458 --> 38:49.125
If anyone comes asking
questions about boy...

38:49.250 --> 38:51.458
I'm not interested in
your affairs, mr Doe.

38:51.542 --> 38:53.625
I'm just here for
the salary on Friday.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.583
I only meant to teach him a lesson.

38:59.458 --> 39:01.750
I thought he'd come back...

39:03.125 --> 39:05.500
Thought he'd come back.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.250
(Door bell jangles)

39:11.292 --> 39:14.083
They don't know anything,
except what's in the papers.

39:14.292 --> 39:16.458
Good god, that's enough, isn't it?

39:16.750 --> 39:19.208
Henry the comb looks
like death warmed up.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.792
Ssh! The troll's speaking;

39:20.917 --> 39:24.625
she said, 'Barrett never had a penny to bless
himself with — what happened to the money?'

39:24.667 --> 39:26.375
well, I could answer that in one.

39:26.875 --> 39:30.292
(Mickey) Phip's moving up now,
madge is pushing the boat out

39:30.333 --> 39:32.625
(Mickey) Safe for him to
come alongside. (Chuckles)

39:34.708 --> 39:36.583
Ah, I've lost them now.

39:36.792 --> 39:39.917
Fill up the glasses, Mickey. Tio
pepe, please, not this treacle.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.500
Certainly, ph.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.667
Come on — another drink
all round, we'll feel better.

39:46.833 --> 39:48.792
Thanks, madge — I'ii— I'll sink a jar.

39:48.875 --> 39:52.042
I'm flush this week.
Modelling for mandrake.

39:52.125 --> 39:53.542
Luxury fridges.

39:53.667 --> 39:54.958
Mandrake's good to you.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.042
(Madge) Mmm... old pals' act.

39:57.167 --> 40:00.250
(Madge) We were in rep together
twenty years ago at Bournemouth.

40:01.042 --> 40:04.208
Not for me, thanks, madge.
Don't feel like drinking today.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.500
Well, I'm off. Bye, all.

40:07.750 --> 40:09.167
(Eddy) Bye, Henry.

40:12.208 --> 40:15.458
For a man sitting on a goldmine,
Henry looks pretty miserable.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.625
Henry's sold his goldmine.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.583
-What? —what did you say?

40:19.625 --> 40:23.708
(Fred) Yes. Bloke over there — he's
the estate agent who did the sale.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.125
Think I'll slide now, sport.

40:32.375 --> 40:34.458
So long, madge. Have
one on me next time.

40:34.917 --> 40:37.000
That'll be the day.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.542
Fred...

40:42.917 --> 40:44.333
Yeah?

40:44.958 --> 40:47.917
Who's the bloke in the pinstripe?
He keeps looking at me.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.875
(Fred) I don't know. Used to come in
the wheatsheaf when I was there.

40:51.958 --> 40:53.542
Real lone wolf.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.792
I'd better go. See you.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.042
So long, eddy. —yeah, cheers.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.458
I don't know how you can stand 'em.

41:02.542 --> 41:03.667
Who?

41:03.750 --> 41:07.125
Eddy and phip and the rest of 'em.
All the same, the whole bloomin' lot.

41:07.208 --> 41:09.167
Oh, I thought they amused you?

41:09.250 --> 41:11.167
Oh, they're good for a laugh, all right...

41:11.208 --> 41:14.125
Very witty, at times. Generous, too.

41:14.208 --> 41:15.750
But I hate their bloody guts.

41:15.833 --> 41:17.000
Hey!

41:17.083 --> 41:18.833
Well, don't look at me like that.

41:18.875 --> 41:21.000
Well, they're just not quite normal, dear.

41:21.083 --> 41:25.625
What's it matter to you? If they had gammy
legs or something, you'd be sorry for them.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.875
Sorry for 'em? Not me.

41:27.917 --> 41:31.875
It's always excuses — every
newspaper you pick up, it's excuses.

41:32.375 --> 41:37.833
Environment, too much love as kids... too little
love as kids... they can't help it... part of nature.

41:38.750 --> 41:41.667
Well, to my mind, it's the
weak, rotten part of nature.

41:41.750 --> 41:44.958
And if they ever make it legal, they may
as well license every other perversion.

41:45.458 --> 41:48.625
(Chuckles) Come on, Mickey,
this place is getting boring.

41:48.917 --> 41:51.333
Let's go and see what
the postman brought us.

41:51.417 --> 41:55.583
Should be a nice bag today. I think our
little efforts might be very well rewarded.

41:55.875 --> 41:59.250
Good day, gentlemen;
Good day. Tomorrow, I hope?

41:59.417 --> 42:01.208
Insincere bastard!

42:01.333 --> 42:03.583
Well, what else can
you be in this game?

42:11.833 --> 42:14.208
Eddy... I just saw you passing.

42:14.583 --> 42:16.125
Sold your shop?

42:16.417 --> 42:17.750
Who told you that?

42:17.792 --> 42:20.458
Fred at the chequers. He
heard through the estate agent.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.958
Why, is it a secret?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.125
No, of course not. But I wish people
would mind their own business, that's all.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.708
Anyway, I'm off on Thursday.

42:28.583 --> 42:32.667
Eddy... I am sorry about boy.
You'll miss him.

42:33.375 --> 42:34.917
Yes.

42:35.042 --> 42:38.625
If you're sending any flowers,
put a few blooms in for me.

42:39.667 --> 42:41.500
Yes, I will.

42:41.542 --> 42:44.042
Well... goodbye, then.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.250
Yes, goodbye... and good luck.

42:58.333 --> 43:00.583
-Chilly today, sir. —yes.

43:42.375 --> 43:44.792
Take a seat, sir. I shan't
keep you a minute.

43:52.292 --> 43:54.000
Well, I'm not sure
it'll lead anywhere...

43:54.125 --> 43:58.917
The chap I know has got a good hairdressing
business... and he's been acting jumpy lately.

43:59.167 --> 44:01.833
Well, now he's suddenly decided to sell up.

44:02.958 --> 44:05.875
Yeah, well, it could be he's
being squeezed as well.

44:06.917 --> 44:08.667
What's his address?

44:11.417 --> 44:13.000
And his name?

44:16.375 --> 44:19.125
I'd like to catch him
just before he closes.

44:19.417 --> 44:21.708
Yeah, well, I must hang up
'cause I've got customers.

44:21.750 --> 44:23.958
Yep, Henry's of harbourne street.

44:24.083 --> 44:25.625
Right, bye.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.208
Thank you. —thank you.

44:45.375 --> 44:47.542
Er, mr Henry?

44:49.125 --> 44:51.125
I'm sorry, sir, we're just closing.

44:51.208 --> 44:53.500
This won't take very long;
It's a... private matter.

44:53.917 --> 44:55.875
I'll be off, then, mr Henry.

44:55.917 --> 44:58.167
That's all right, George,
I'll close up. Good night.

44:58.208 --> 44:59.750
Good night.

45:00.958 --> 45:02.625
I understand you're selling this place.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.000
Who told you that?

45:04.083 --> 45:05.976
You're being blackmailed, aren't you?
—what are you talking about?

45:06.000 --> 45:07.625
I don't know what
you're talking about!

45:07.667 --> 45:09.351
But you are selling this place,
all the same, aren't you?

45:09.375 --> 45:12.000
I haven't told anyone where
I'm going... who are you?

45:12.042 --> 45:14.184
And you're afraid of being followed.
Who's squeezing you, Henry?

45:14.208 --> 45:15.958
I don't know.

45:18.708 --> 45:20.458
Who are you?

45:21.750 --> 45:23.708
- —You're from the police?
- No.

45:24.750 --> 45:27.042
I'm a friend of someone
you used to know...

45:27.958 --> 45:29.792
Boy Barrett.

45:32.125 --> 45:35.333
I want to know who killed him.
You can help me.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.958
How do you pay the money?

45:38.292 --> 45:40.417
I don't remember...
I'm not saying anything.

45:42.292 --> 45:45.375
I can't help the way I am, but
the law says I'm a criminal.

45:45.958 --> 45:48.083
I've been to prison four times.

45:49.542 --> 45:52.875
I couldn't go through
that again, not at my age.

45:54.708 --> 45:56.583
I'm going to Canada.

45:56.792 --> 46:00.417
I've made up my mind to be 'sensible',
as the prison doctor used to say.

46:02.125 --> 46:04.708
Don't care how lonely... but sensible.

46:06.042 --> 46:08.333
Can't stand any more trouble...

46:11.000 --> 46:14.333
I'm sorry about boy Barrett.
But he's dead... finished.

46:14.417 --> 46:16.083
Nothing can help him now.

46:16.167 --> 46:18.583
Barrett's death was murder.

46:18.792 --> 46:20.542
(Farr)
Do you want that to go unpunished?

46:20.708 --> 46:22.042
Who...

46:23.167 --> 46:24.750
Who are you?

46:24.958 --> 46:27.000
Melville farr. I'm a barrister.

46:27.042 --> 46:29.000
The blackmailer can't reach you in Canada.

46:29.042 --> 46:31.458
Tell me how you pay the money,
and let me deal with it.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.917
It wouldn't help.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.167
- —Do you know anyone else who's paying?
- No, no!

46:35.250 --> 46:36.792
I think you do.

46:36.833 --> 46:38.792
I'm not saying another
word, mr farr.

46:41.583 --> 46:44.083
My number's in the book.

46:44.125 --> 46:45.958
If you change your mind, let me know.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.458
Not a chance. I've
got myself to think of.

46:48.542 --> 46:51.625
Nature played me a dirty trick.

46:52.083 --> 46:54.875
I'm going to see I get a few years'
peace and quiet in return.

46:55.542 --> 46:58.042
You've got a big position;
They'd listen to you.

46:58.750 --> 47:01.333
You ought to be able
to state our case...

47:01.583 --> 47:04.417
Tell them there's no magic
cure for how we are.

47:04.542 --> 47:06.917
Certainly not behind prison bars.

47:07.917 --> 47:10.250
I've come to feel like
a criminal, an outlaw.

47:12.625 --> 47:15.083
Do you know what I think, mr farr?

47:15.375 --> 47:17.583
I think boy Barrett's well out of it.

47:42.042 --> 47:44.583
We've never met, Henry,
but we know each other.

47:48.708 --> 47:51.500
You might say that we're pen-pals.

47:54.708 --> 47:58.333
Now, they say that you're going
away without paying your debts.

47:59.042 --> 48:02.167
(Tuts) Bad show, Henry.

48:02.708 --> 48:06.042
You can't expect to flourish
like the green bay tree.

48:07.417 --> 48:09.208
Don't interrupt.

48:09.375 --> 48:12.667
You've been talking to mr melville farr.
What did you tell him, hm?

48:12.708 --> 48:14.208
I didn't tell him anything.

48:14.292 --> 48:19.042
Well, now, think, Henry... what did
you tell that fine, upstanding barrister?

48:19.583 --> 48:21.542
I didn't tell him anything!

48:23.000 --> 48:25.292
You ridiculous old sordid, you.

48:25.750 --> 48:29.750
If you could only see yourself.
You look your age tonight, Henry.

48:31.083 --> 48:33.292
What a funny colour you've gone.

48:37.542 --> 48:40.292
I think we'll have a little privacy.

48:45.208 --> 48:48.083
You know, I could do
a lot of damage here.

48:48.208 --> 48:50.708
Five, ten minutes...

48:51.667 --> 48:53.333
And you wouldn't have much to sell.

48:54.333 --> 48:55.958
(He smashes the glass)

48:56.083 --> 48:58.000
(Sandy youth) Do stop gaping.

48:58.042 --> 49:00.667
(Sandy youth) There's nothing
a little chat won't put right.

49:00.917 --> 49:03.542
(Sandy youth) All I want is the
answer to a simple question:

49:04.458 --> 49:07.292
(Sandy youth)
What did you tell mr melville farr?

49:07.458 --> 49:09.125
(Glass shattering)

49:19.000 --> 49:20.375
Oh, hello, doctor.

49:20.417 --> 49:22.708
'Evening, mrs farr.
You should be off home.

49:22.792 --> 49:24.625
I just wanted to see him finish this.

49:24.708 --> 49:26.750
Hmm... doesn't seem to
be much wrong with him now.

49:26.833 --> 49:28.643
(Laura) No, he's been
working happily all afternoon.

49:28.667 --> 49:30.934
(Doctor) Perhaps this'll help
him sort it out for himself.

49:30.958 --> 49:32.625
Anyway, let me
know how he gets on.

49:32.667 --> 49:34.750
I'll just give him another five minutes.

49:35.333 --> 49:36.750
(She sighs)

50:23.625 --> 50:27.750
Well, he was all right when I left the
place... making a funny noise in his throat...

50:28.958 --> 50:32.250
Well, it looks like we have
lost a good subscriber.

50:32.875 --> 50:35.875
No. No, I don't think
he told farr anything.

50:36.625 --> 50:39.750
Yeah... yes, you're right, farr
is showing a lot of interest.

50:40.625 --> 50:43.292
I think we ought to find
out what he's up to.

50:44.917 --> 50:47.583
A cop doing his rounds found
the back door unlocked.

50:47.917 --> 50:51.167
Henry was lying there with
the telephone in his hand...

50:51.750 --> 50:53.875
Shop smashed to blazes.

50:54.875 --> 50:56.667
Henry had a weak heart.

50:56.792 --> 51:00.292
Did you say... he had
the telephone in his hand?

51:00.375 --> 51:02.167
Yes, that's right.

51:03.042 --> 51:06.167
Stone, do you know anybody
called 'Troy carraway'?

51:06.792 --> 51:08.625
No, never heard of him.

51:08.708 --> 51:09.934
Is that something to
do with Henry?

51:09.958 --> 51:11.893
I don't know whether it's got
anything to do with Henry...

51:11.917 --> 51:15.268
But there was a rather curious message at the house
tonight, my housekeeper couldn't quite understand it.

51:15.292 --> 51:18.000
She said the caller sounded
drunk, or ill, or something...

51:18.042 --> 51:22.208
But, apparently, he said
'troy— ' or 'try carraway'.

51:22.625 --> 51:24.583
Could that have been Henry?

51:24.833 --> 51:26.083
'Carraway'...?

51:26.125 --> 51:27.417
Does it ring a bell?

51:28.667 --> 51:32.292
Now, wait a minute... I know a chap
who gets his hair cut at Henry's...

51:32.333 --> 51:34.625
Or, he did, but it, it's
not 'carraway', but it's...

51:34.708 --> 51:37.184
-What is it? —...Well, it's like
it... he's— he's a famous bloke...

51:37.208 --> 51:40.333
Look, you'll know him, I bet,
he's... a gallery girl's delight!

51:40.458 --> 51:42.250
(Trolley rattles Lou dly)

51:46.625 --> 51:47.750
(Knock at door)

51:47.792 --> 51:49.083
Mm, yah?

51:49.167 --> 51:51.208
There's a mr melville
farr to see you, sir.

51:51.292 --> 51:53.083
Oh, show him in.

51:56.167 --> 51:57.542
Mr farr, sir.

51:57.583 --> 52:01.083
Ah. Well, how nice to see you.
I didn't know you were in front.

52:01.167 --> 52:02.917
I wasn't; I was too late for the play.

52:03.083 --> 52:05.458
Well, never mind. Take a pew.

52:05.542 --> 52:06.833
Thank you.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.958
I've enjoyed your
performances several times.

52:10.083 --> 52:14.333
I saw you and Leigh hunter defend dr
porchester. He should have hung, you know.

52:14.375 --> 52:17.018
There was a moment when we thought
he would — we were all very relieved.

52:17.042 --> 52:19.167
Hmm. Well, what can I do for you?

52:20.458 --> 52:22.375
I've come round to see
if you can help me.

52:22.500 --> 52:26.042
Not another charity matinee?
I've done two this month already.

52:26.458 --> 52:28.875
No, this is something rather
more serious, I'm afraid.

52:30.542 --> 52:31.917
Oh?

52:32.542 --> 52:34.958
This is impertinent...

52:35.250 --> 52:39.208
And I may be mistaken, but...
Do you ever receive an envelop

52:39.667 --> 52:41.833
like that containing a
demand for money?

52:48.208 --> 52:50.458
Is this some sort of a joke?

52:50.625 --> 52:52.667
(Farr) Would you tell me how you pay it?

52:52.750 --> 52:54.750
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52:54.917 --> 52:56.417
I think you do.

52:57.583 --> 53:01.083
I have a... a client in
the same situation.

53:02.625 --> 53:05.167
I thought you might co-operate
and help me to put an end to it.

53:10.125 --> 53:11.458
Albert!

53:11.542 --> 53:13.167
- Sir?
- Mr farr is leaving.

53:13.292 --> 53:14.958
(Farr) Thank you.

53:15.708 --> 53:17.792
I can find my own way out.

53:17.833 --> 53:19.684
Now, then, can you rustle me
up an evening standard?

53:19.708 --> 53:21.908
- —Certainly, sir.
- All right. Right away — right away.

53:25.292 --> 53:27.125
(He dials number)

53:33.000 --> 53:34.667
Hullo, Teddy?

53:34.792 --> 53:36.792
This is tiny.
Thank god you're at home.

53:36.875 --> 53:38.458
I'll be round in twenty minutes.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.250
All right?

53:45.667 --> 53:47.250
Sir...

53:47.583 --> 53:51.383
There's been a hairdresser found dead in harbourne
street. Just came through on the teleprinter.

53:51.542 --> 53:53.875
Shop was broken up;
Looks like a murder case.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.917
Harbourne street...
That's west end central.

53:56.292 --> 53:58.542
Haven't we enough crime in
this division for you, bridie?

53:58.625 --> 54:00.625
He was a convicted homosexual, sir.

54:02.167 --> 54:03.500
I see.

54:03.708 --> 54:07.542
There might be a tie-up with the Barrett case.
If this hairdresser was paying blackmail, too...

54:07.583 --> 54:09.833
I'm quite as good at guessing
as you are, sergeant.

54:09.917 --> 54:11.667
Just get me the facts, will you?

54:11.708 --> 54:12.792
Yes, sir.

54:12.833 --> 54:15.250
Ifjust one of them would
come forward... just one.

54:16.125 --> 54:18.458
They're afraid of this
sort of violence, sir.

54:18.583 --> 54:20.792
Yes, of course, they're only little people.

54:22.208 --> 54:24.542
I thought we might have
heard from mr farr, though.

54:42.333 --> 54:43.958
Mel?

54:45.042 --> 54:47.708
The boy in the paper... Barrett.

54:48.542 --> 54:51.000
The one that hanged himself
in Fulham police station.

54:51.417 --> 54:53.417
Is that the same boy
that 'phoned here?

54:55.042 --> 54:56.417
Yes.

54:57.292 --> 54:58.625
Yes, it is.

54:58.708 --> 55:00.958
You were there yesterday.

55:01.542 --> 55:03.708
Did the police send for you?

55:04.125 --> 55:05.542
Yes.

55:05.583 --> 55:07.000
Why?

55:08.500 --> 55:10.458
Apparently, they'd found a book.

55:11.583 --> 55:14.500
He'd kept, er... a scrapbook.

55:16.958 --> 55:19.333
Press cuttings about me. Pictures.

55:22.125 --> 55:23.375
Why?

55:26.708 --> 55:28.125
Hero worship.

55:30.083 --> 55:32.083
Who was this boy Barrett?

55:36.125 --> 55:38.375
I gave him a lift occasionally.

55:38.458 --> 55:40.125
You never told me.

55:45.250 --> 55:47.750
Papers say he was a wages clerk.

55:48.417 --> 55:50.125
He'd been stealing from his firm.

55:50.958 --> 55:53.542
How did you come to
meet a boy like that?

55:55.125 --> 55:56.917
Back in the spring.

55:58.125 --> 56:02.125
After a late session, he...
The last buses had gone.

56:03.417 --> 56:05.042
That's only once.

56:05.083 --> 56:06.500
You said 'occasionally'.

56:06.542 --> 56:10.622
I know — I know what I said! Can't we discuss this
without turning the whole place into a battleground?

56:13.208 --> 56:15.708
You stopped seeing him
and he killed himself...

56:20.292 --> 56:22.042
It's Phil stainer all over again.

56:24.375 --> 56:26.208
It wasn't the same with stainer.

56:28.625 --> 56:30.917
- Well, Barrett was...
- —what was Barrett?

56:36.292 --> 56:39.542
When we were married, we had
no secrets from each other.

56:40.125 --> 56:43.375
I made you a promise then. I haven't broken
that promise, if that's what you mean.

56:44.250 --> 56:46.000
Why did you stop seeing him?

56:47.458 --> 56:49.708
He was getting too fond of me.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.667
Are you sure you weren't
getting too fond of him?

56:53.708 --> 56:55.208
Answer me!

56:56.167 --> 56:58.583
I want to know the truth.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.667
I want to know why he hanged himself.

57:01.792 --> 57:03.292
He was being blackmailed.

57:03.417 --> 57:05.208
That's why he stole? —yes.

57:06.625 --> 57:09.750
Someone found out he was a
homosexual and blackmailed him?

57:12.625 --> 57:14.083
That's it.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.208
It takes two to make a
reason for blackmail.

57:21.042 --> 57:22.708
Were you the other man?

57:23.333 --> 57:25.000
Were you?

57:25.500 --> 57:27.792
Tell me everything — I want to know!

57:29.417 --> 57:30.958
(Softly) I don't want you to.

57:31.458 --> 57:33.833
I'd rather know than guess!

57:41.583 --> 57:44.083
He'd been paying for months...

57:45.000 --> 57:48.583
To stop copies of this
going round the temple.

57:50.167 --> 57:51.833
Why is he crying?

57:51.958 --> 57:53.718
I'd just told him I couldn't
see him anymore.

57:53.875 --> 57:55.792
So he knew it was the end.

57:57.458 --> 57:59.375
And so did you.

58:01.208 --> 58:03.500
Look at the picture.

58:04.042 --> 58:07.042
There's as much pain in
your face as there is in his.

58:07.167 --> 58:08.833
You haven't changed.

58:08.917 --> 58:11.958
In spite of our marriage, in your
innermost feelings you're still the same.

58:12.958 --> 58:16.875
It's why you stopped seeing him; You
felt for him what you felt for stainer.

58:17.042 --> 58:18.542
(Farr) That's not true!

58:18.625 --> 58:21.417
You were attracted to that boy
as a man would be to a girl!

58:22.083 --> 58:25.292
Laura, Laura, don't go on, for
god's sake, stop! Stop now!

58:25.500 --> 58:28.875
I can't stop! I— I love
you too much to stop.

58:28.958 --> 58:30.708
I thought you loved me.

58:30.792 --> 58:34.042
If you do, what did you feel for
him? I have a right to know!

58:34.375 --> 58:37.500
All right, you want to
know — I shall tell you.

58:37.542 --> 58:40.708
You won't be content until you know,
will you? Until you've ripped it out of me!

58:42.000 --> 58:44.917
I stopped seeing him
because I wanted him.

58:45.458 --> 58:48.458
Do you understand? (Shouts)
Because I wanted him!

58:52.958 --> 58:54.833
Now, what good has that done you?

59:08.083 --> 59:10.083
When did it begin?

59:10.375 --> 59:12.208
From the moment I saw him.

59:14.458 --> 59:16.458
You don't call that love?

59:20.833 --> 59:23.333
If it was love, why should
I want to stamp it out?

59:24.833 --> 59:27.000
Why would I do
that if it was love?

59:28.458 --> 59:31.333
His feeling for you? What was that?

59:32.625 --> 59:33.958
(Softly) I don't know.

59:35.417 --> 59:38.750
Yes, I think, perhaps, for him...

59:40.292 --> 59:42.417
Perhaps, for him, it was love.

59:44.250 --> 59:46.667
The only kind of love he could feel.

59:48.333 --> 59:50.583
He died for it to protect me.

59:57.792 --> 01:00:00.833
That thought will remain with
you for the rest of your life.

01:00:02.292 --> 01:00:05.125
I don't think there's going to
be room for me as well.

01:00:49.667 --> 01:00:52.750
Oh, yes, m'lord... oh, just
one moment, please.

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:55.458
Lord fullbrook, sir.

01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:59.917
Oh. Thank you, mrs Brooks.

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:02.083
Yes, Charles?

01:01:04.625 --> 01:01:06.625
Well, can't it wait till Monday?

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.292
I must say, you make
it sound very dramatic.

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:14.875
Very well...

01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:17.542
If you put it on a personal basis.

01:01:17.625 --> 01:01:18.708
What address?

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.000
Eighteen, nightingale mews.

01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:50.167
Come in. Fullbrook's waiting inside.

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:55.917
(Charles) Oh, hello, farr.
Good of you to come.

01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:57.708
You said it was a
matter of life and death.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.417
It is, to me.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:02.417
You two know each other?
—come to cases, Teddy; Come to cases.

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:05.292
I'm afraid you upset tiny
at the theatre last night.

01:02:05.458 --> 01:02:07.542
Ask him who he's working for, Teddy.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:12.583
You seem set on stirring up a
lot of trouble. I want you to stop.

01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:15.375
What exactly does it have
to do with you, Charles?

01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:18.333
Well, the demands addressed to Calloway...

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.708
Cover the three of us.

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:37.042
I see.

01:02:38.833 --> 01:02:40.500
Frankly, I'm surprised.

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:44.333
Why? You're a sophisticated man,
you know the invert is part of nature.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:45.542
Sherry?

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:47.417
But I've known you for years, Charles.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.917
One is discreet about these things!

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.667
What do you want?

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:57.792
Well, I want you to persuade your client to join us.
We'll pay the blackmailer off in one nice, big sum, hm?

01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:59.167
Any idea who it is?

01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:04.125
It's a filthy thing, extortion.

01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:06.375
Where do you leave the money?

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:11.125
At the— (sighs) There you are, Teddy,
you haven't have done a damn bit of good.

01:03:11.208 --> 01:03:16.833
Steady, tiny. Listen... our apparently calm acceptance
of this blackmail must seem very extraordinary to you.

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:23.083
But do you ever wonder about the law that makes us all victims
of any cheap thug who finds out about our natural instincts?

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.417
Paying blackmail won't alter the
law, it'll only encourage the blackmailer.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.000
We've got to pay.
Tell him, Teddy; Explain.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.458
If we don't pay, ten
to one we land in jail,

01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:37.250
with our crime — so called — damn nearly
parallel with robbery with violence.

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.417
Man-made laws are never perfect.

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:42.500
I'm a born odd man out, farr...

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.875
But I've never corrupted the normal.

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:50.167
Why should I be forced to live outside the
law because I find love in the only way I can?

01:03:51.042 --> 01:03:53.875
You're a star, Calloway.
People like you set a fashion.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:58.000
If the young people knew how you lived,
might they think that an example to follow?

01:03:58.083 --> 01:04:00.583
Of course youth must be protected,
we all agree about that.

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:05.042
But that doesn't mean that consenting males in
private should be pilloried by an antiquated law...

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:07.250
And made meat for blackmail.

01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:10.750
If you're old enough to vote, you're old
enough to choose your own way of life.

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:14.583
Many of us reach the grave without
arriving at that stage of responsibility.

01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:16.958
Do you support the law?

01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:19.875
I am a lawyer.

01:04:20.792 --> 01:04:23.125
Do you ever hear from the stainers, farr?

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.375
I was the old man's secretary, that's how
I knew young stainer killed himself...

01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:31.792
While you stayed alive...
Shrouded yourself in virtue...

01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:33.875
And married judge hankin's daughter.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.958
Like an alcoholic takes a cure.

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:42.625
I thought you were unconscionably put out.

01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:47.208
Now I see it's the rage of caliban on
seeing his own reflection in the glass.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:52.625
I may share your instincts,
but I've always resisted them.

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:54.917
That's what cost young stainer his life.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.125
He was a neurotic and an hysteric!

01:04:57.167 --> 01:04:59.708
'Deny me and I'll kill myself'...
He was always crying wolf.

01:05:00.792 --> 01:05:02.667
What did happen to stainer?

01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:06.833
When we were up at Cambridge together

01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:10.125
we became very good friends for a while.

01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:13.375
He was clever... and amusing...

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.333
But quite unstable, and
completely possessive.

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:21.042
One night he telephoned to
say he was going to kill himself.

01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:25.417
I didn't believe him;
He'd said it before.

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:29.375
But, apparently, this time he meant it.

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.417
And that's all there was to it.

01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:34.667
All this ancient history
isn't getting us anywhere.

01:05:34.708 --> 01:05:36.428
(Calloway)
Did you or didn't you? Who cares?

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:40.355
What you've got to do now is to forget any
ideas you've got about exposing these people.

01:05:40.792 --> 01:05:44.333
Bring them down, and we
come with 'em. Just pay.

01:05:44.417 --> 01:05:46.792
You pay, Calloway.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.917
I shall make my own decision.

01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:34.750
(Farr) Darling...

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.417
Darling, come home. It's cold.

01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:42.000
Been awake all night?

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:45.417
Yes, I've been awake.
Looking at myself.

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:55.000
When you told me about Phil stainer,
it was over, in the past.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.792
I was young; Conceited, I suppose.

01:06:59.708 --> 01:07:02.250
I thought marriage would make you content.

01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:06.292
I was wrong.

01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:09.875
That impulse is still there.

01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:13.042
There hasn't been a day that
I haven't thanked god for you.

01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:15.542
Mel, I'm not a lifebelt
for you to cling to.

01:07:15.625 --> 01:07:18.625
I'm a woman. And I want
to be loved for myself.

01:07:18.917 --> 01:07:20.250
I do love you.

01:07:23.042 --> 01:07:27.292
If he was alive and standing beside
me, who would you choose?

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:32.000
You've had your answer to that.

01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:37.708
But he's still in your heart.

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:45.500
I feel completely destroyed.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.167
Have coffee tonight?

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:12.250
There's a real charnel-house atmosphere
in this place today, Mickey.

01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:15.292
Ghastly. I shall we glad when
we get back to cheltenham.

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:18.500
We'll go home after we've
made the last collection. Ssh!

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:20.917
Eddy's on his soapbox again.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:24.332
Henry paid rates and taxes, and he
shopped, the same as everybody else.

01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:26.457
But they knew he couldn't
go out and call the cops.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:29.957
So he just stood there watching... while
these bastards broke up the shop.

01:08:30.042 --> 01:08:31.721
You... you don't know
it happened that way.

01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:34.750
It couldn't have happened
any other way... eh, phip?

01:08:35.082 --> 01:08:37.332
I don't like to think
about it, old mate.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.917
No joy there.

01:08:38.957 --> 01:08:41.125
- Call for you, mr Mortimer.
- Who is it?

01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:43.500
Some bloke — said, 'tell him Sunday'.

01:08:51.582 --> 01:08:53.750
- —Madge...
- What?

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:57.167
Oh, what you drinking?

01:08:57.207 --> 01:09:00.125
Oh... no more for me,
dear. I'm working today.

01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:02.582
Modelling corsets at
hobday and rouse's.

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:08.332
Hope they've kept the studio warm. It's always
the same: Mink in August and bikinis Christmas.

01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:10.792
Oh, well — that's life. See you.

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:12.542
Yeah, bye.

01:09:25.042 --> 01:09:26.957
I don't see how I can.

01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:29.292
But how?

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.250
It's impossible!

01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:34.832
I know, I know.

01:09:35.207 --> 01:09:37.042
I said, 'i know'.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:41.250
Well, I'll work it... I'll work it.

01:09:41.332 --> 01:09:42.957
Yeah... somehow.

01:10:00.667 --> 01:10:03.250
Have a snack. Goon

01:10:03.292 --> 01:10:04.958
no, thanks, eddy.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.375
You look as if you could
do with a good stoke-up.

01:10:07.417 --> 01:10:09.750
How much weight you
lost in the last month?

01:10:09.833 --> 01:10:14.083
Be a laugh, wouldn't it... if one of us
developed some guts and turned copper's nark.

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.625
Somebody putting the
screws on you, phip?

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:19.250
I never said that.
—you meant it.

01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:21.292
Fantasia, sport, fantasia!

01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:24.625
All right, keep your shirt on.

01:10:24.792 --> 01:10:27.792
I'm not suggesting you bash round
the police station and blow the gaff.

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:30.417
Just wanted to be sure.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:33.917
Don't you mix me in anything,
old mate — I can look after myself.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.333
See you.

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:40.875
Anybody can come and
look at a car... sport.

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:50.226
You can put a penny on the bonnet, sir, and I
promise you the coin won't vibrate one iota.

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:52.730
Would you drive around the
park, mr Mortimer? —very good, sir.

01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:32.125
How do you know about me?
—eddy stone.

01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:35.833
Eddy had no right to butt in.
I shan't half tear him off a strip.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.042
Look, why don't you tell
them to do their damndest?

01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:41.083
I daren't. Couldn't afford the publicity.

01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:43.458
Slightest smell and I'd be
out of the old man's will.

01:11:43.542 --> 01:11:45.333
There's quite a little bit coming to me.

01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.833
What's with you? You're
not here for the ride.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:50.583
I knew boy Barrett.

01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:54.500
Tragic little sport.

01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:57.542
Came to me when he was on the
run. I couldn't do much for him...

01:11:57.625 --> 01:11:59.083
I was broke.

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:00.750
You look broke.

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:02.667
You're very realistic.

01:12:02.792 --> 01:12:04.542
It's a very realistic situation.

01:12:04.625 --> 01:12:06.083
What have they got on you?

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:10.792
Some... some letters, in my
handwriting. They're all signed.

01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:15.292
You can't afford to buy those letters.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.833
I can.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.833
What's all this generosity in aid of?

01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:23.708
I want to get in touch with them;
They won't get in touch with me.

01:12:23.792 --> 01:12:27.352
You tell me when your next summons is, I'll
go in your place and negotiate for both of us.

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:29.792
Wish I had the
guts to trust you.

01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:33.292
You can trust my bank balance.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.083
I've had my next summons:

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:39.750
Tonight, Smith place. Eight o'clock.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.292
How many letters?

01:12:43.417 --> 01:12:44.917
Five.

01:12:45.917 --> 01:12:47.208
Right.

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:19.417
(Sandy youth)
Over here, mr farr.

01:13:28.917 --> 01:13:30.542
You bring a policeman?

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:35.333
Not that I care if you have.
You see, my motto is different from yours:

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:37.625
'Mens sana in corpore sano'.

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:39.417
My god, you...

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.042
Ah—ah... it wouldn't take long for a magistrate to
decide who's got the clean mind in the healthy body.

01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:52.125
Ah... I knew the white hope of cavendish cars would
blab when I saw him joyriding with you in the park.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.375
Well?

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.625
I want to buy his letters, and what
you've got on me — the negative.

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:01.000
I shan't take one without the other.

01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:05.417
I must remind you, mr farr, that you're
in no position to say what you'll do.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.708
It's a question of policy with us.
We don't usually sell original material.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.667
It won't be peanuts.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:18.042
I shan't hand over any money until
I see the negative, and the letters.

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:21.083
The question is, how much?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.708
Hmm, now, don't push,
mr farr... don't push.

01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:28.125
We say when.

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:36.875
Well, we've had this 'will he or won't he?'
Conversation so often.

01:14:36.958 --> 01:14:40.667
Well, I've met him now, and I agree he's
not the subject for continual pressure.

01:14:41.208 --> 01:14:44.250
Soft for, oh, one
payment, though — mm.

01:14:44.417 --> 01:14:46.250
Mm, well, now, not too greedy...

01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:49.958
Yes, he's got a lot at
stake; A wife, career...

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:54.125
Yes, the more they've got the
more they'll fight to keep it.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:15:00.417
Huh, now— now— now, that
is a hell of a good idea!

01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:04.917
Mm-hm, I'll watch.
I'll make sure she's out.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.042
Oh, it'll only take me a few
moments once I'm there.

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:12.333
A nice salutary warning; 'See
what'll happen if you blab', hm?

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.083
Okay, will do... bye.

01:15:44.167 --> 01:15:46.393
Oh, don't bother to close it,
I've got to go back to the clinic.

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.167
It's better to.

01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:04.333
It's only whitewash. It'll wash off.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.708
What does it mean, Laura?

01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:16.292
I don't know. Hooligans.

01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:19.333
Nonsense! Too explicit.

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.625
This spells oblique blackmail to me.

01:16:22.292 --> 01:16:23.708
What's behind it?

01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:25.708
I don't know.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.458
Oh, come along.

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:29.250
It's beginning to make a pattern.

01:16:29.375 --> 01:16:31.042
How long have you known?

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:33.167
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.000
Is Mel 'queer', as they say?

01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:40.167
You'll have to make up
your own mind about that.

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:43.875
I've already done that, my dear.

01:16:44.792 --> 01:16:46.875
It's time you had someone to talk to.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.875
You knew nothing about this boy Barrett,
you didn't suspect anything?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.750
I suppose in the back of my mind
I've always dreaded this, but...

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Mel seemed so happy and
satisfied with our marriage.

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:02.583
Successful...

01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:07.292
Oh, he's been successful, all right, but what has
this marriage meant for you? Have you been satisfied?

01:17:08.292 --> 01:17:09.833
Yes...

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.750
Yes.

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:14.708
He's very kind and understanding.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:16.333
That's not what I mean.

01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:18.667
Have you found real love, Laura?

01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:23.958
Yes, I... I think so.

01:17:25.042 --> 01:17:26.750
It's all I've known.

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.458
How dared he marry you!

01:17:29.833 --> 01:17:34.583
There was nothing he didn't tell me. I
married Mel knowing everything about him.

01:17:34.625 --> 01:17:37.792
How could you possibly understand
what it might mean? You were nineteen.

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:39.500
I loved him then.

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:45.500
In spite of everything, I...
I can't stop loving him.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:49.083
You can't understand that, can you?

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:51.500
No. I don't think I can.

01:17:52.833 --> 01:17:57.667
My dear, I've prosecuted and I've defended
this offence. Either way, it brings havoc.

01:17:57.708 --> 01:17:59.417
Mel hasn't committed an offence.

01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:02.083
Perhaps not; But the rot's still there.

01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:04.958
Look how he's behaving now — what's
happened to his integrity?

01:18:05.042 --> 01:18:08.875
Mel's to become a qc, Laura;
Eventually a judge, even.

01:18:08.958 --> 01:18:12.583
Is he going to sit on the bench knowing he,
himself, has covered up a serious crime?

01:18:12.625 --> 01:18:14.333
But he's done nothing, I tell you!

01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:18.417
The crime I'm talking about is blackmail.

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:21.338
If he doesn't go to the police about
this he'll be covering up blackmail.

01:18:22.125 --> 01:18:28.375
But... if he does go to the police... it's the end
of his career — everything he's ever worked for.

01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.583
It's the end of himself if he doesn't.

01:18:31.125 --> 01:18:34.917
He can either go to the police — which,
apparently, he's reluctant to do.

01:18:35.042 --> 01:18:36.958
Or he can deal with it himself.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.333
Oh, yes, Mel's clever enough to run them
down, turn their own weapon against them:

01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:42.458
'Do as I say or I'll hand you over'.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.958
And what does that make him?
A blackmailer... no better than they are.

01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:50.875
You mean he can't avoid being
destroyed whichever happens.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.083
Yes, I do, Laura.

01:18:53.167 --> 01:18:55.375
And I don't want you to
be destroyed with him.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:59.375
You're young enough to start again. Clear off,
leave me! To fight this battle on his own.

01:19:00.708 --> 01:19:03.042
You don't really think
I could do that?

01:19:03.167 --> 01:19:08.375
It's not only you I'm thinking of. I've got a son. And I'm not
going to have Ronnie hero-worshipping Mel, knowing what I do.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.500
Think you'd better go.

01:19:16.583 --> 01:19:18.333
Perhaps I had.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:26.333
Well... I'm up the
road if you want me.

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:42.958
A telegram, sir. Miss Hobson sent it over,
she thought it might be important.

01:20:00.292 --> 01:20:02.250
I'm going out.

01:20:03.625 --> 01:20:07.542
Er... cancel my lunch date, and, er...

01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:11.042
Apologise to mr canning.

01:20:11.375 --> 01:20:12.417
Right, sir.

01:20:35.542 --> 01:20:38.583
What does it mean, 'contact your wife?'

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:41.292
has someone been to the house?

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.875
What does it mean?

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:51.250
There was something on the garage door.

01:20:52.875 --> 01:20:54.958
Big letters, in paint.

01:20:55.958 --> 01:20:57.750
What did it say?

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.625
I don't want to tell you.

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.292
What did it say?

01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:08.875
'Farr is... queer'.

01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:43.042
What does the rest of it
mean? All these instructions?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.333
Where to take the
money and how to pay it.

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:50.083
The dirty words on the garage door
are a final test of strength.

01:21:50.958 --> 01:21:54.758
They're... they're a gentle reminder that you can
be included in this sphere of operations, too.

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.875
Are you...

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:01.708
Are you going to keep the appointment?

01:22:03.375 --> 01:22:10.208
A man who's paying blackmail is
hardly likely to make an ideal qc.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:13.083
I'm sure your brother
Scott will tell you that.

01:22:14.917 --> 01:22:16.875
Oh, never mind what Scott says.

01:22:18.625 --> 01:22:21.250
He's a perfect barometer
of public morality.

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:25.333
In any case, he's right.

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:29.083
But if I hand the blackmailer
over to the police...

01:22:29.542 --> 01:22:31.750
It won't just be the
end of my career.

01:22:33.083 --> 01:22:35.417
It'll be the end of everything.

01:22:35.792 --> 01:22:40.417
And our ugly little story will appear in daily
instalments on millions of breakfast tables.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.042
On the other hand, if I pay...

01:22:46.375 --> 01:22:48.208
I buy security...

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.583
Of a sort.

01:22:51.542 --> 01:22:53.583
What are you going to do?

01:22:55.958 --> 01:22:59.333
For the moment, I'm going up to town.
I've taken enough away from you already.

01:23:00.833 --> 01:23:03.333
When I come home I shan't
expect to find you there.

01:23:04.542 --> 01:23:07.000
Just leave an address with
mrs Brooks so that I...

01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:11.042
So that she can send
anything on to you.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.375
William.

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.333
Come down here
a moment, will you.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:46.375
(William) Yes, sir.

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:50.833
Close the door.

01:23:53.792 --> 01:23:55.875
I'm afraid you've...

01:23:56.542 --> 01:23:59.542
Got to prepare yourself
for a bit of a shock.

01:24:00.792 --> 01:24:04.000
I'm sorry to worry
you with this, but, er...

01:24:04.542 --> 01:24:07.333
I'm not quite sure how this
is all going to end, and I...

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:10.708
I don't want it to
burst in your face.

01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:22.917
I see the implication, sir. But this
couldn't be the basis of any charge.

01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:26.625
I know.

01:24:27.583 --> 01:24:29.875
That's the tragedy of it.

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.500
The boy thought it could.

01:24:33.125 --> 01:24:35.875
It wouldn't mean anything
if he weren't crying.

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:41.625
As it is, I suppose
it looks everything.

01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:43.667
Yes.

01:24:44.917 --> 01:24:47.250
It's a very good likeness.

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:50.167
We must get the negatives.

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:53.333
Thank you, William.

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.875
I expected at least one question.

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:02.917
Don't you have any?

01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:06.667
I've believed in your
integrity for ten years, sir.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.625
I can see no reason
to question it now.

01:25:33.167 --> 01:25:34.875
(Farr)
Get me Fulham police station.

01:25:35.375 --> 01:25:39.792
It's all there. Ask marylebone to pick 'em up.
Get 'em red-handed when they collect the loot.

01:25:40.333 --> 01:25:41.750
Right, sir.

01:25:41.958 --> 01:25:43.000
Yes?

01:25:43.167 --> 01:25:44.167
Who?

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.208
Bridie — listen to this call.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.875
Put mr farr on.

01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:58.208
No, sir, I'm not really surprised...

01:25:58.792 --> 01:26:00.875
I thought you'd be
calling sooner or later.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.958
Yes, mr farr... I'm listening.

01:26:08.042 --> 01:26:11.250
Six homing pigeons, ph.
Not bad for a last collection.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.333
Very good, my dear.

01:26:13.917 --> 01:26:16.417
I say, this one's got a
dollop in its beak...

01:26:16.458 --> 01:26:18.833
A cheque for fifty pounds
from that woman in exeter.

01:26:18.917 --> 01:26:20.875
You certainly can pile on the agony!

01:26:20.917 --> 01:26:22.917
Don't open them in the street, Mickey!

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:24.833
All right — I thought
you'd just like to know.

01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:26.583
And we'd like to know, too.

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:30.917
It's a fair cop, son.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.042
I don't know what you're
talking about. Who are you?

01:26:33.167 --> 01:26:34.833
Police officers, making an arrest.

01:26:34.875 --> 01:26:36.208
On what charge?

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:37.833
Yes, what's the charge?

01:26:37.917 --> 01:26:40.875
False pretences; A system
of writing begging letters.

01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:45.423
(Police officer) Presenting yourselves as widows
and orphans for the purpose of extracting money.

01:26:45.958 --> 01:26:50.375
'I was deeply moved by your letter telling
me of your husband's tragic death.

01:26:50.417 --> 01:26:53.167
Nothing can ease your grief,
but I hope the enclosed cheque

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:56.750
will help keep yourself and poor
little Wendy out of queer street.'

01:26:56.875 --> 01:26:57.875
(he tuts)

01:26:58.583 --> 01:27:00.542
Come along now. The car's waiting.

01:27:19.875 --> 01:27:22.875
You're late to the post, miss benham.
You'll get your toes trodden on again.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.101
I'll leave early, if I may, and post them
opposite the flat. There's never a crowd there.

01:27:26.125 --> 01:27:27.208
Oh, very well.

01:27:49.208 --> 01:27:50.708
Can I help you, sir?

01:27:50.792 --> 01:27:53.667
Er, where do you keep the,
er, minor classics, please?

01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:55.458
Far shelves.

01:27:56.208 --> 01:27:57.875
-May I look? —certainly.

01:28:50.375 --> 01:28:52.458
Leave that, sir, I'll see to it.

01:28:56.667 --> 01:28:58.417
You're melville farr, aren't you?

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.042
Yes?

01:29:01.542 --> 01:29:03.333
Step in here, will you, please?

01:29:13.583 --> 01:29:15.583
How dare you come in my shop!

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:17.833
Can't you leave me
to mourn in peace?

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.250
I'm very sorry, only...

01:29:21.792 --> 01:29:23.875
What have your troubles
to do with me?

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.667
You ruined my life.

01:29:26.167 --> 01:29:28.083
Boy Barrett was happy here with me.

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:30.833
I'd have taken him into partnership.

01:29:30.917 --> 01:29:32.625
He'd have had a home here.

01:29:32.917 --> 01:29:34.833
You destroyed all that.

01:29:35.167 --> 01:29:36.958
Do you realise what you did?

01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:43.458
I realise everything.

01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:26.625
Well, hoey?

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:29.565
The money was taken down and
pocketed almost immediately, sir.

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:31.083
Come on.

01:30:33.958 --> 01:30:36.458
There we are, sir. The money's
in the shoulder bag.

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:41.292
Well, you get back to the station,
get out of your Sunday suit.

01:30:41.417 --> 01:30:43.208
- —No use busting your cover.
- Right.

01:30:43.292 --> 01:30:46.833
Are you sure you'd recognise the youth on
the lambretta without his goggles, sir?

01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:48.250
Recognise him anywhere.

01:30:48.292 --> 01:30:49.375
Right.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.875
Sandy? Sandy!

01:31:20.958 --> 01:31:23.292
(Sandy youth)
Hi. Don't come in for a minute, bee.

01:31:23.333 --> 01:31:25.667
- —Did you collect?
- Yes. All here.

01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:27.375
(Sandy youth) Okay.

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:38.167
Come in, bee.

01:31:40.708 --> 01:31:43.125
Hmm... look at this.

01:31:43.167 --> 01:31:45.000
Fabulous shot!

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:48.292
Astonishing detail for a telescopic lens.
Look at that — sharp as a knife.

01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:50.083
Only had half a minute to get it.

01:31:50.208 --> 01:31:53.792
How stupid can they get?
Picking up a boy in the park...

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:55.167
Hmm...

01:31:55.208 --> 01:31:57.708
It's a pity we're going
on a long vacation.

01:31:57.792 --> 01:32:00.833
Still, never mind... we'll keep
the old gentleman on ice.

01:32:02.375 --> 01:32:04.875
I'm sorry to be through with farr.

01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:08.667
I'd enjoy making that fine,
upstanding barristerjump.

01:32:11.208 --> 01:32:12.875
Ten days and I'm off.

01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:17.583
As usual, beautifully timed. A week's notice
to poor old Doe, and no attention drawn.

01:32:18.792 --> 01:32:22.000
Er... by the way, are we going
to let our friend off the hook?

01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:25.583
We'll give him that impression. I told him
to cover over. Should be here soon.

01:32:26.042 --> 01:32:29.417
Of course, when we start our business
again we'll jerk on the line a bit...

01:32:29.458 --> 01:32:32.917
Show him the photostats... remind
him the hook's still there.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.292
You really are a bit
odd, aren't you?

01:32:36.375 --> 01:32:37.583
How do you mean?

01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:42.667
Oh, I don't know... a sort of cross between
an avenging angel and peeping Tom.

01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:48.833
They disgust me. When I found out about
mr Doe and that boy, I felt physically ill.

01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:53.000
They're everywhere, everywhere you
turn! The police do nothing! Nothing!

01:32:53.417 --> 01:32:56.500
Someone's got to make them
pay for their filthy blasphemy.

01:32:56.625 --> 01:32:58.309
(Voice of bridie)
We want you, get inside there!

01:32:58.333 --> 01:33:00.601
(Voice of phip) What do you want?
What do you think you're doing?

01:33:00.625 --> 01:33:02.393
(Voice of phip) This is a
private flat! Now, get out of here!

01:33:02.417 --> 01:33:03.667
What's the matter?

01:33:03.833 --> 01:33:05.708
(Miss benham)
What is it? What does this mean?

01:33:07.875 --> 01:33:10.250
These are marked notes.
You're both under arrest.

01:33:10.292 --> 01:33:11.875
You'll be charged at the station.

01:33:12.125 --> 01:33:13.833
(Farr)
He's the one I told you about.

01:33:13.875 --> 01:33:15.417
You won't testify to that in court.

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:17.250
Oh, yes, I will.

01:33:17.667 --> 01:33:23.208
That'll make a fine swansong to a big career.
'Eminent lawyer's astonishing private life'.

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.667
A real ball for the national press.

01:33:25.792 --> 01:33:27.000
That's enough.

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:30.292
Very tough, now, aren't we, when
it comes to protecting perverts?

01:33:30.333 --> 01:33:32.726
I suppose the police force is riddled
with it, like everything else!

01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:33.958
Shut up. —on your feet.

01:33:34.125 --> 01:33:35.583
You're coming too.

01:33:35.958 --> 01:33:37.434
He's all right, he's
one of their victims.

01:33:37.458 --> 01:33:40.792
Hah! You hear that,
phip? You're a victim!

01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:43.583
I'm afraid you're barking up
the wrong tree there, mister.

01:33:43.667 --> 01:33:46.333
It's a question of dog
eat dog, isn't it, phip?

01:33:48.042 --> 01:33:51.500
It wasn't my fault... I couldn't
pay them any more money...

01:33:52.708 --> 01:33:54.625
And then they said,

01:33:54.875 --> 01:33:59.833
if I gave the names of my friends, they'd
give me back a letter every time.

01:34:00.542 --> 01:34:04.958
What do you think of our little Judas?
Revolting spectacle, isn't he?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.250
Come on. —one moment, please.

01:34:06.458 --> 01:34:07.958
Shoes.

01:34:15.708 --> 01:34:17.125
Coat.

01:34:20.833 --> 01:34:22.250
Ready.

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:26.583
It's the ungodly in great
power, all right...

01:34:26.667 --> 01:34:29.042
And flourishing like
the green bay tree.

01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:32.958
But we'll have our say
in court, though. (Tuts)

01:34:35.417 --> 01:34:37.292
On your feet. Move.

01:34:37.458 --> 01:34:39.250
Don't charge me under my real name.

01:34:39.292 --> 01:34:43.692
I've got money coming to me, quite a bit of money. I
wouldn't mind sharing it, I'm not greedy, I'd sign a note!

01:34:43.833 --> 01:34:45.792
I'll walk him downstairs, sir.

01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:52.475
They're going to be very vicious
when they do get into court, sir.

01:34:53.208 --> 01:34:55.500
Don't worry, Harris,
I shan't let you down.

01:34:55.583 --> 01:34:56.875
No, sir.

01:34:58.583 --> 01:35:00.542
What do you think they'll get?

01:35:00.875 --> 01:35:02.833
With your evidence, the limit.

01:35:03.042 --> 01:35:06.750
Barrett's death and that little hairdresser
fellow, Henry, are bound to weigh against them.

01:35:07.375 --> 01:35:11.708
Well, I'm glad we've got them... but it seems tragic
that your career has to go west in the getting.

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:16.167
Somebody once called this law against
homosexuals 'the blackmailer's charter'.

01:35:17.792 --> 01:35:19.625
Is that how you feel about it?

01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:22.417
I'm a policeman, sir.
I don't have feelings.

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:27.257
Well, if you'll come with me now, sir, it'll be
helpful if we can have your statement right away.

01:35:27.292 --> 01:35:28.625
Yes.

01:35:54.625 --> 01:35:56.792
Good evening, sir.
—good evening.

01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:58.833
You've just missed mr Patterson.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.167
Mr Patterson?

01:36:02.375 --> 01:36:03.750
(Laura) Mel?

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:06.333
Mel, I...

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:10.958
I didn't expect to see you here.

01:36:12.458 --> 01:36:14.167
What did William want?

01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:16.500
He came to tell me
you'd been to the police.

01:36:18.792 --> 01:36:20.375
I see.

01:36:21.417 --> 01:36:23.667
How long before the
case becomes public?

01:36:24.625 --> 01:36:29.958
There'll be a remand at the magistrates' hearing
tomorrow. I've got about, er, three weeks.

01:36:30.542 --> 01:36:32.292
Three days, you mean.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.333
You can't hope to keep
this out of the press.

01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:39.875
It's not as though you can go into the
court as 'mr x', you're too well-known.

01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:42.208
I don't want to.

01:36:42.708 --> 01:36:45.792
I believe that if I go
into court as myself,

01:36:45.875 --> 01:36:49.125
I can draw attention to
the fault in the existing law.

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.417
Knowing it'll destroy you utterly?

01:36:52.708 --> 01:36:53.750
Yes.

01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:00.583
We're going to need each
other very much, aren't we?

01:37:03.917 --> 01:37:06.458
No, no... I'm going to
go through this alone.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.042
I don't want you here
when it happens.

01:37:10.292 --> 01:37:13.708
I started this thing; I've
hurt you terribly, I know that.

01:37:14.833 --> 01:37:18.958
But I can just get through it to the end if
you're not here to face the final humiliations.

01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:24.333
They're going to
call me filthy names.

01:37:25.917 --> 01:37:29.542
My friends are going to lower their eyes,
and my enemies say they always guessed.

01:37:31.417 --> 01:37:34.125
I don't want you a part
of that Roman holiday.

01:37:35.958 --> 01:37:38.250
I love you too deeply for that.

01:37:38.583 --> 01:37:40.333
Shall I come back?

01:37:43.833 --> 01:37:45.833
You, erm...

01:37:46.542 --> 01:37:49.125
Must have time to...

01:37:49.167 --> 01:37:51.875
You must have time to
decide that for yourself.

01:37:51.958 --> 01:37:53.250
(Clears throat)

01:37:55.042 --> 01:37:56.875
If you can...

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.750
If you can bearto...

01:38:04.333 --> 01:38:08.417
Afterwards, when it's all over
and the... shouting's stopped.

01:38:11.625 --> 01:38:13.750
Because it's then that
I'm going to need you.

01:38:15.667 --> 01:38:17.833
I'm going to need
you so desperately.

01:38:20.042 --> 01:38:21.625
'Need'?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.042
That's a bigger word than 'love'.

01:38:28.792 --> 01:38:31.000
Suddenly I feel very strong.

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:37.708
Strong enough?

01:38:39.833 --> 01:38:41.333
I think so.
