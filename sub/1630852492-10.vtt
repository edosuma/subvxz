08:56.069 --> 08:57.769
I told you to stop calling me,

08:57.904 --> 08:59.704
<i> I'm mad at you right now,</i>

08:59.706 --> 09:02.974
- Okay, I'm sorry.
I-I hear you.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.376
Thing is, I don't really
understand you.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.312
- I took your advice, right?
I opened up to nina,

09:08.348 --> 09:10.515
She immediately stabbed me
in the back.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.816
I knew I shouldn't have
told her,

09:11.952 --> 09:13.718

- But you know you needed

09:13.720 --> 09:15.653

sooner or later,

09:15.789 --> 09:18.456

news in the upper echelons

09:26.400 --> 09:28.800

Uh, okay, then.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.902
- I'm gonna have this baby
my way, understand?

09:31.939 --> 09:35.339
I don't need a total re-brand
just because I'm pregnant.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.075

to change.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.810

of the iceberg.

Sorry, shit.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.769
We were just being

These are just your pregnancy
hormones talking,

11:52.846 --> 11:54.678
We wanna be here.
- No.

I literally heard you earlier.

11:56.183 --> 11:59.551

because I don't have a baby.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.219

- I'm sorry, lone driver?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.370
- Yeah, yeah, he uh, shows up,
chases you around

13:26.439 --> 13:28.439
From room to room, makes you
think your life's in danger,

13:28.508 --> 13:30.275
Falls out a window,
and he's on his way.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.244
But um, well, he had to cancel
on account of the storm.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.912
- Yeah, sure.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.681
- But he was part of
the package I paid for.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.382
- It doesn't sound like you
paid for anything, there, val.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.918
- Gena, zip it.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.086
- I know, val, you "paid"
for package b,

13:42.222 --> 13:43.888
But uh, it's not gonna happen.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.857
If you want to change
to package a,

13:45.992 --> 13:48.593
Uh, I'll need about 20 minutes
to whip up some pentagrams.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.061
- No thanks, we're good.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.664
- Come on, kathy,
quit pulling our legs.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.765
Okay! He's already here.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.201
I just let him in. Ooh!

13:57.204 --> 13:58.903
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, no, that's uh...

13:59.038 --> 14:00.905
That's not possible.
- Well, I did.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.874
- Wait, sorry, val,
you let someone in here?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.710
- That's right, a man.
- You let a stranger into
the hou--

14:05.712 --> 14:08.012
That is recklessly dangerous.

house like macaulay culkin.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.883

blue eyes, blond hair.

No, kate, you're up.

will leave you

someone who would leave you

17:41.895 --> 17:44.161
If you had a miscarriage?

17:44.197 --> 17:46.964
You're worth so much more than
that, it's actually insane.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.999
- You listen to me, if this
fuckface would leave you

17:49.069 --> 17:51.035
For having a miscarriage,
then he does not deserve

17:51.104 --> 17:52.903
To be walking around
with intact testicles.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.772
I will slice that bag
right open.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.842
Ssst!

woman!

18:13.560 --> 18:15.359

from the alert.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.428
- Wait, what?
- The guy on the loose.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.530
They found him.
- Wait,

18:19.566 --> 18:21.798

isn't the man from the alert,

And just think, if you had
abandoned your anger,

20:04.370 --> 20:06.270
You wouldn't have been able
to protect us.

20:06.405 --> 20:08.372
Who knows what that man
would've done to us?

20:08.374 --> 20:10.274
- Yeah, well, nothing,
considering he was innocent.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.844

Lionel should be the one

twice,
