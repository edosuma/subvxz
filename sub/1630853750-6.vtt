WEBVTT

00:20.770 --> 00:22.147
The very best.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.242
Oh!

00:34.993 --> 00:37.412
-Sorry.
-Oh, no, no, no.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.540
It is I who must apologize, fair maiden.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.791
-Oh, my.
-Mm?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.710
-Wow. Wow.
-Huh?

00:43.793 --> 00:45.503
-The leather or the metal?
-It's both.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.546
-You like that?
-I do.

00:47.172 --> 00:51.384
You, on the other hand...
Be still, my beating heart.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.969
Oh, what, this old thing? Oh.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.680
You are the fairest maiden in the land.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.140
You're nuts.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.977
I'm sorry I was asleep
when you got home last night.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.189
Oh, that's okay. I was surprised
when I woke up and you weren't there.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.858
I had to get up early
to help Preacher set up the tavern.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.902
I thought you were avoiding me.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.320
-No.
-No?

01:10.403 --> 01:12.947
I wasn't, but I don't wanna fight either.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.328
Just because we don't agree on something
doesn't mean that it has to be a fight.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.246
I'll try to remember that.

01:21.581 --> 01:25.085
-We have to go sign in with Muriel.
-Ah, Muriel.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.002
Okay.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.923
You should stick around
for the knight's duel,

01:30.006 --> 01:32.175
because it is the festival's
biggest moneymaker.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.134
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.096
Oh, look, there's Jack now.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.764
-Hello.
-Hey, Muriel.

01:37.847 --> 01:41.810
We're ready to sign in for our shifts.
I'm at the med tent, Jack's at the tavern.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.271
Yes, well, you're late, but I forgive you.

01:45.355 --> 01:49.651
So, Tim, this is Jack Sheridan.
He has been waiting for you to arrive.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.402
Tim Lonergan.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.406
Oh, you're Chris' brother.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.784
You look a lot like him.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.203
Hi. My name's Mel Monroe.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.955
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.250
It's an honor to meet you in person.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.919
Yeah, same. What brings you to the fair?

02:08.002 --> 02:10.421
Actually, I was just on my way to Oregon.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.175
I went to the bar,
but your sign said that you were here.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.887
-You came to see me?
-Yeah, I actually have something for you.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.389
Can we...?

02:20.014 --> 02:21.808
Yeah, I'll just wait for you over here.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.143
-Okay?
-Yeah.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.103
Sure.

02:34.154 --> 02:34.988
What is this?

02:37.866 --> 02:42.537
It's a letter Chris wrote my parents
right before he was killed.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.793
I was cleaning out the garage, I found it
at the bottom of my mother's jewelry box.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.921
That night you called
looking for my mom and dad...

02:52.839 --> 02:55.091
I realized
how much guilt you were still carrying.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.052
I told him I'd bring him home,
and I didn't.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.679
I wanted you to hear this from me.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.975
Chris wouldn't have blamed you,
and neither does my family.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.898
I thought reading this letter
might help you let go some of that guilt.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.862
It's nice of you to bring it to me
in person, and thank you.

03:18.823 --> 03:22.911
Sorry, I can't quite get over
how similar you guys look.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.957
I was pretty young when he enlisted.
I don't remember much,

03:28.041 --> 03:31.419
but he used to call me the Tim Man

03:32.378 --> 03:35.089
and pretend to put oil on me.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.969
Yeah, he was funny as hell.

03:42.931 --> 03:43.765
He was a good guy.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.266
He was honest,

03:46.476 --> 03:47.310
super loyal,

03:48.019 --> 03:50.772
and whenever things got really bad,
he'd just--

03:51.522 --> 03:54.525
He'd tell a joke,
and it would cut the tension in half.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.778
Everybody loved him.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.446
Listen, Jack...

04:00.406 --> 04:03.952
From the bottom of my heart, I hope that
this letter helps you find some peace.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.622
Thanks.

04:14.712 --> 04:15.755
Hey.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.051
-Hey.
-Hey, are you okay?

04:21.636 --> 04:22.553
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.556
Honey, what did he want?

04:26.641 --> 04:29.769
He gave me a letter
that Chris wrote before he died.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.772
He thought maybe
it might help me feel better.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.026
-Oh, my gosh. Did you read it?
-No, not yet.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.864
-Why don't we just go home?
-No.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.076
Okay? Yeah.
We can sit together or you can be alone.

04:45.159 --> 04:48.496
I got-- I gotta do the tavern with Preach.
I got the duel this afternoon.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.873
I know, babe,
but I think he can handle the tavern,

04:50.957 --> 04:53.960
-your feelings are more important--
-I'm okay. Okay?

04:54.043 --> 04:55.503
-You are?
-Trust me.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.713
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.882
-I'll catch up with you later.
-Okay.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.900
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.113
Oh, can I have my tabor pipe?

05:22.905 --> 05:24.324
What's a tabor pipe?

05:24.407 --> 05:27.618
The one I gave you to put in your pocket
so I wouldn't forget it.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.204
Oh, I-- Yeah,
I must have left it at the house.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.499
-Can you drive back and get it?
-Do you really need it?

05:33.583 --> 05:36.961
How will people know I'm a musician
if I don't have an instrument?

05:37.045 --> 05:40.048
Well, there's gotta be a mandolin
or a lyre around here somewhere,

05:40.131 --> 05:43.468
and I do not wanna drive
all the way back to the house.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.677
It's 15 minutes.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.179
Each way.

05:46.262 --> 05:50.892
Vernon, what's up with you today?
You're wound tighter than a ten-day clock.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.519
I don't think we should get into it here.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.147
We're supposed to meet up
with Denny any minute now,

05:56.230 --> 05:59.776
and I want his first impression of you
to be positive.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.779
I'll make sure
I'm my usual, delightful self.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.113
Get into what?

06:05.948 --> 06:08.159
-You really wanna know?
-I asked.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.453
I know you canceled
the neurologist appointment.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.956
I told you, Muriel doesn't know
what she's talking about.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.250
I'm a doctor. I have my own sources.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.213
-Why did you lie to me?
-Because I didn't wanna go.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.633
And I'm tired of you
telling me what to do.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.551
With you, it's just a one-way street.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.136
What's that supposed to mean?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.764
You have no trouble
bossing me or anyone else around,

06:29.847 --> 06:32.350
but you can't even follow doctor's orders.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.186
Hey, Denny.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.814
Denny, how are you, son?

06:39.148 --> 06:41.150
-Great, thanks.
-I'm Hope.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.862
Oh, it's good to finally meet you.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.408
You too. Doc's told me
a ton of nice stuff about you.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.035
Well, clearly,
you've got the Mullins charm.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.914
So how have you been enjoying
Virgin River?

06:54.997 --> 06:55.957
It's incredible.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.626
Everyone's so friendly
and the hiking is awesome.

06:58.709 --> 07:03.381
I've been thinking, at night that room
at the clinic gets hotter than Hades

07:03.464 --> 07:07.343
because somebody refuses
to upgrade the air conditioning system.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.594
It wasn't that bad.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.929
Did you wake up sweating?

07:11.597 --> 07:12.598
That's what I thought.

07:12.682 --> 07:17.645
There's no reason for you to be miserable
when you can stay with us at the house.

07:19.647 --> 07:20.773
Are you sure?

07:20.857 --> 07:21.691
Absolutely.

07:22.942 --> 07:23.776
Right, Vernon?

07:24.318 --> 07:25.820
Of-- No, of course.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.029
Fabulous.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.408
We'll leave a key under the mat
so you can come and go.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.536
-Thanks. That's so generous of you.
-You're welcome.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.914
I think you'll find our home
to be a bastion of peace and tranquility.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.002
Hey, Muriel is looking for you, son.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.046
-Oh, I'll see you guys later, then.
-Go.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.007
Bye.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.760
What the hell was that?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.305
Me calling a truce.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.809
-There you go.
-Thanks.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.814
Here's the Henry VIII hat.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.193
How do you know what hat the guy wore?

08:05.276 --> 08:07.695
Because I was researching Anne Boleyn.
I looked it up.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.366
You sure you want me to play
the guy who cut off your head?

08:12.450 --> 08:14.160
Just put it on.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.787
Okay. All right,
but I'm doing this for you.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.872
-All right?
-Okay.

08:17.955 --> 08:18.789
For you.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.502
-Oh, God, I look ridiculous.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.129
I think you look quite dashing.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.339
We will take it.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.300
Brave choice, Lady Boleyn.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.344
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.179
Okay, let's go to the tavern.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.431
A few drinks
will help me forget about the hat.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.016
No, not for drinks.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.393
I told Jack we'd stop by,
show him my costume.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.814
Ah. Yeah, you know what?
Why don't you go ahead? I'll hang here.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.611
I-- I just -- I don't wanna see him.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.239
-Why?
-He came by my work last night

08:51.322 --> 08:53.491
and kind of pissed me off.

08:54.116 --> 08:57.370
I'm gonna need you
to be a little more specific.

08:57.453 --> 09:01.374
He wanted to know what happened the night
of the shooting, so I told him everything,

09:01.457 --> 09:04.126
but he kept pressing me and pressing me,

09:04.210 --> 09:06.379
like I was holding back on him.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.755
He's really stressed.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.174
Everyone's stressed about something.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.134
Brady, he's my brother.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.223
If you guys can't be around one another,
that's gonna be a problem for me.

09:17.306 --> 09:20.017
Look, ever since I got back from Iraq,

09:20.101 --> 09:22.937
I have been trying
to get him to respect me.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.773
No matter what I do, he still just--

09:26.983 --> 09:30.361
He treats me like some dumb kid.

09:32.071 --> 09:32.905
Right.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.497
Sheridan, you dirty scoundrel.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.623
King John.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.794
-Whoa.
-What? What's up?

09:46.877 --> 09:49.088
Last year you wore a ball cap and shorts.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.133
So you guys open or what?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.719
Are you looking
for a drink there, constable?

09:54.802 --> 09:56.929
It's my day off. You know it.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.599
Well, give us five minutes
to tap the kegs.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.225
As you wish.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.021
So the outfit?

10:05.104 --> 10:07.481
You know,
me and Lizzie are doing a scene together.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.650
Yeah, and looking good, Romeo.

10:09.734 --> 10:14.614
-So things are heating up between you two.
-Oh. No, but at least she's talking to me.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.532
Hey, you know what they say.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.534
Slow and steady wins the race.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.454
Don't listen to him.
You gotta be bold. Tell her how you feel.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.540
You guys are confusing me here. It's--

10:24.624 --> 10:26.584
Well, how about I keep it simple?

10:26.667 --> 10:29.503
-Grab another box of mead.
-On it.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.596
Is something bothering you?

10:39.764 --> 10:40.598
I'm all right.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.436
Hey. What is it?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.194
Lonergan's brother, Tim?

10:55.154 --> 10:56.030
He's here.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.991
At the fair?

10:59.075 --> 10:59.992
Mm-hm.

11:00.076 --> 11:05.581
Yeah, he wanted to give me a letter
that Chris had written his parents.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.917
Oh.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.002
Wow, that's heavy.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.713
How you feeling?

11:15.299 --> 11:16.550
It's eerie, you know?

11:17.551 --> 11:19.553
His demeanor reminded me of Chris.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.138
Yeah, yeah, I bet.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.519
Listen, if you wanna bail,
I can handle things here.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.855
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'll shake it off. Thanks, though.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.697
Hi.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.367
Hey, you okay?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.371
-What's wrong?
-Hope.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.916
She canceled her neurologist appointment
the other day and she lied about it.

11:48.999 --> 11:49.917
Oh, no.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.629
And she's been so damn difficult
about her follow-up care. I--

11:55.548 --> 11:58.843
Oh, well, I mean,
you know how independent Hope is.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.513
It's hard for her to be relying on someone
when she's not used to it.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.516
Someone? I'm not just someone.
I'm her husband.

12:05.599 --> 12:09.353
Right, which is why
she's taking her frustration out on you.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.481
-No good deed goes unpunished.
-Yeah.

12:15.693 --> 12:20.489
Um, is it possible that you might have
left the drug cabinet open yesterday?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.868
No, no, I wasn't even in there,
but check with Cameron.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.536
Right.

12:26.120 --> 12:26.954
Great.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.417
-And one of these.
-Great. Thanks. That looks so good.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.752
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

12:38.966 --> 12:42.970
Hey, guess what. Doc and Hope
just invited me to stay at their place.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.849
It was mostly Hope. I think
Doc found out at the same time I did.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.435
Cool. Do you wanna order something?

12:50.019 --> 12:54.315
Yeah, I'll take a couple slices
of the almond cake, please.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.526
So you excited?

12:58.402 --> 12:59.445
About what?

12:59.528 --> 13:02.615
Your performance. You and Ricky
are listed on the theater schedule.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.200
I'm nervous.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.244
You're gonna do great.
I'll be rooting for you.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.707
-So you're gonna watch?
-Of course. Why wouldn't I?

13:12.500 --> 13:16.462
I don't know. I...
I thought you weren't into Shakespeare.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.088
Why would you think that?

13:19.757 --> 13:20.674
I don't know.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.972
Well, uh, anyway,
thanks for the tarts, and break a leg.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.557
Thanks.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.317
So I saw this little lyre
at a stand over there,

13:38.400 --> 13:41.487
-the guy said I could use it all day.
-Oh. That is great.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.532
-I'll see you at the duel.
-You bet you will, sire.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.699
Mm-hm.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.204
Julia. Wow.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.914
Glad you could make it.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.166
You guys look great.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.876
Thank you, so do you.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.211
Why, thank you.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.588
Preacher, this is my niece, Maya.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.674
Maya, this is my friend, Preacher.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.969
Pleased to meet you, Maya.
So are you having fun?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.722
Can I have my phone back?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.183
I thought we agreed,
no phones while we're here.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.601
I need to call my mom.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.775
-Where's the bathroom?
-That way. Make a left.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.531
I'm sorry, we were just over at archery,

14:25.614 --> 14:27.908
and she's frustrated
because she didn't hit the target.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.452
Most people don't hit it their first try.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.039
But she's been taking lessons
and she expected to do better.

14:34.123 --> 14:38.085
-She's obsessed with <i>The Hunger Games</i>.
-I'm a pretty good shot.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.378
Maybe I could help.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.506
Really? Well, if you can convince her
to go back and try again,

14:42.590 --> 14:46.760
-that would be very heroic of you.
-Oh, well, one hero coming up.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.724
-Meet me back here in an hour, Your Grace.
-Ooh. My liege.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.605
Keep that on there.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.442
Here's your tea.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.359
Oh, thanks.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.320
And I got you a coffee, Doc.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.281
-That was very thoughtful. Thank you.
-No problem.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.994
So did we solve the mystery
behind the unlocked drug cabinet?

15:12.870 --> 15:16.081
Hey, uh, there's an emergency
at the maypole.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.001
-What happened?
-That's what Muriel said, anyway.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.879
Apparently, if nobody's dancing,

15:21.962 --> 15:26.175
then as she put it,
the festival cannot be festive.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.092
Oh, we can go.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.637
-We? We can?
-Yeah. Yeah, we can.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.680
The queen says
it's an emergency, we can go.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.849
-You're good, right?
-Okay.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.148
You big into maypole dancing?

15:41.231 --> 15:42.316
No, gosh, no.

15:42.399 --> 15:46.236
I just-- I-- I can't have
that drug cabinet conversation with Doc.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.155
-Why not?
-Because last night

15:48.238 --> 15:52.201
when I went to the clinic,
Denny was going through the drug cabinet.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.037
We have Schedule II drugs in there.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.748
-What was he doing?
-He said he was looking for aspirin

15:57.831 --> 15:59.667
and that the door was unlocked.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.044
-But it's always locked.
-Exactly.

16:02.544 --> 16:06.632
So the best-case scenario is that
one of us accidentally left it open.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.928
Or Denny broke into the cabinet
and he lied about it.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.682
He asked me not to tell Doc.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.893
-Yeah, that's not a very good idea.
-I know.

16:18.686 --> 16:23.273
But what if I tell Doc, and then
Denny happens to be telling the truth,

16:23.357 --> 16:24.942
then I ruin their relationship?

16:25.025 --> 16:28.028
But if he is lying,
then Doc deserves to know.

16:30.114 --> 16:30.948
Yeah.

16:36.662 --> 16:41.250
A Roman by a Roman valiantly vanquished.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.210
My spirit is going.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.380
I can no more.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.969
Noblest of men, woo't die?

16:52.720 --> 16:55.431
Has thou no care of me?

16:55.514 --> 16:58.684
Shall I abide in this dull world,

16:58.767 --> 17:03.105
which in thy absence
is no better than a sty?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.629
-Mel, take this one.
-Hey, thanks.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.633
Muriel came to me, she says
you're clockwise, I'm counterclockwise.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.261
Means nothing to me.
No idea what she's talking about.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.429
-No?
-No.

17:35.512 --> 17:39.558
So I haven't done this since grade school,
but the basic premise is just over/under.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.394
-That doesn't help me.
-Not helpful?

17:42.895 --> 17:46.440
Okay, so on the over count,
you're gonna go over me. Right?

17:46.523 --> 17:49.943
-Okay, like that?
-That. Then you'll go under her ribbon.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.404
-Okay.
-Keep weaving your way through.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.532
-Does that make sense?
-Sure.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.618
-You'll be fine.
-Are we ready?

17:57.701 --> 17:59.369
All right, here we go.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.539
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-See you on the other side.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.839
Skip, Cameron!

18:10.923 --> 18:11.757
Yup.

18:13.967 --> 18:14.968
Slow down.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.688
All right. Here we go.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.942
-Skip, skip, skip. There you go.
-Skip, skip.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.276
-There you go.
-Skip.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.738
You did it. Good job.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.201
Oh, thank you.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.375
Don't you think
we're old for cotton candy?

18:46.458 --> 18:48.669
It's not cotton candy, it's spun sugar.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.629
What's the difference?

18:50.712 --> 18:53.215
-The name on the sign.
-Uh-huh.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.467
I can't believe
you've never had it before.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.845
My parents never took me anywhere
when I was a kid.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.763
That makes me sad.

18:59.847 --> 19:00.931
It's no big deal.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.516
-Hey, you...
-Hmm?

19:04.309 --> 19:07.271
You got something.
Wait, don't move. Let me get it.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.943
Mm.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.821
-You taste like sugar.
-That's 'cause I'm sweet.

19:15.904 --> 19:16.905
Oh.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.956
-Who is it?
-It's Calvin.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.499
What does he want?

19:28.542 --> 19:31.879
-He wants to meet up.
-Okay. This is good.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.048
This is your chance
to make him think you are all in.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.180
I still got a little time.
What else you wanna do?

19:41.680 --> 19:44.057
Um, I'd like to see baby goats.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.226
I wanna take a picture
of the one wearing the pajamas.

19:46.310 --> 19:50.606
No, please, no, it freaks me out
when people dress animals up in clothes.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.983
-It's creepy.
-No, it keeps them warm.

19:53.984 --> 19:57.070
I don't wanna go to the doctor.
I have the right not to go.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.949
Sounds like he's more mad
about the lying than your not going.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.119
Trust me, if I'd been honest with him,
it would have been a fight.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.495
So?

20:05.579 --> 20:06.413
So...

20:07.581 --> 20:09.666
I don't have energy like I used to.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.586
Sometimes I need
to take the path of least resistance.

20:12.669 --> 20:16.798
-Have you told Doc how you feel?
-He knows. Or at least he should know.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.802
Ever since Doc found out
that you were in the hospital,

20:20.886 --> 20:22.679
he's been worried sick about you.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.432
He thought he was gonna lose you
and he was devastated.

20:25.515 --> 20:28.602
Still, that doesn't give him
the right to control me.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.607
I think you're still angry with Doc
because he didn't tell you about Lilly.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.776
And if that's the reason,

20:35.859 --> 20:41.531
you should be mad at Lydie,
and Muriel, and Jo Ellen, and me,

20:41.615 --> 20:45.244
because we all knew
and we didn't call you either,

20:45.327 --> 20:47.871
because that's how Lilly wanted it.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.208
-Why?
-Doesn't matter why.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.543
You don't understand,

20:53.627 --> 20:56.838
I didn't know
that the last time I saw Lilly would...

20:58.799 --> 20:59.925
be the last time.

21:01.134 --> 21:05.973
-I feel like I was robbed.
-You were. But that's not Doc's fault.

21:06.056 --> 21:10.269
And if you don't stop blaming him,
your relationship won't survive.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.617
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.869
How was the maypole?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.039
It was really fun.
I wish you'd been there.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.417
Well, there's always next year.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.295
How are you doing?

21:36.378 --> 21:38.630
Oh, good. Good as gold.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.759
Okay. Can I take you home now?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.638
-You're not having a good time?
-I'm worried about you.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.058
Being in a place that's loud and crowded
is really stressful.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.145
I'm used to loud and crowded.
I own a bar, remember?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.440
-Jack, come on.
-What?

21:57.441 --> 21:59.484
What's going on?
What's going on in your head?

21:59.568 --> 22:02.279
I mean, I know that seeing Tim
was really upsetting for you.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.824
I was surprised to see him, sure.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.702
And?

22:10.662 --> 22:13.457
And what? I'm not sure
what else you want me to say.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.459
I'm totally fine.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.965
I can't tell
if you're lying to me or to yourself.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.301
Jack, we need more mulled wine.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.722
Mulled wine. Duty calls.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.478
Nice.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.690
You wanna try? Come on. You got this.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.621
Okay, see, now the trick...

22:54.706 --> 22:59.336
is not to be afraid to pull the string
all the way back to your face like this.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.550
Whoo!

23:07.052 --> 23:08.553
Come on, now, here you go.

23:13.141 --> 23:15.268
So when you pull back, inhale,

23:15.894 --> 23:18.688
and then exhale on the release.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.614
-There you go.
-Good work.

23:27.697 --> 23:31.201
-That's better. Okay. You wanna try again?
-Yeah.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.665
This draws my very soul of counsel!

23:38.291 --> 23:40.168
Stop my mouth.

23:43.338 --> 23:47.968
Tickets are now being sold
for the knight's duel.

23:53.348 --> 23:56.560
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.770
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.022
Have saints not lips,
and holy palmers too?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.817
Ay, pilgrim,
lips that they must use in prayer.

24:03.900 --> 24:07.279
O, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do;

24:07.362 --> 24:10.282
they pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.795
-You were so good.
-You were like the perfect Romeo.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.306
For the record,
you're the one who kissed me.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.891
It seemed like they wanted us to.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.310
-Are you going to the knight's duel?
-Yeah.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.811
Okay. I'll see you then.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.860
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey.

24:48.111 --> 24:49.613
-What's that smell?
-What?

24:50.947 --> 24:54.367
Oh, you saw me feeding the baby goats.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.328
Don't worry, I washed my hands.

24:56.411 --> 24:59.080
I don't think any amount of scrubbing
will get rid of that.

24:59.164 --> 24:59.998
Oh, come on.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.627
-Can I just get an ale, please?
-Yes, yes, yes.

25:04.711 --> 25:08.340
So Brady told me
you stopped by Emerald Lumber last night.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.342
Yeah.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.553
I did. Why? What did he say?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.472
He said you were condescending.

25:16.014 --> 25:19.017
How? All I did was ask him
if he remembered anything new

25:19.100 --> 25:22.729
-from the night of the shooting.
-Could you just try to be nicer to him?

25:22.812 --> 25:24.981
Nicer to him?
I've done everything for that guy.

25:25.065 --> 25:28.068
I gave him a job. I put him up
when he had no place else to go.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.986
And he goes and steals from me?

25:30.070 --> 25:32.072
Then he works for Calvin?
That's messed up.

25:32.155 --> 25:37.369
I get it. I'm not saying you're
in the wrong, but he's important to me.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.495
And he's trying.

25:39.829 --> 25:43.250
So I need for you guys
to at least be civil to one another.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.585
A lot of history there.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.256
I still don't trust him.

26:04.312 --> 26:05.564
What is that?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.482
Some kind of medieval marzipan.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.360
You know I hate marzipan.

26:10.443 --> 26:14.573
I tried to get you a bear claw,
but those are a 20th century invention.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.371
Vernon?

26:23.248 --> 26:24.499
I owe you an apology.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.544
I've been a little difficult.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.131
Okay, I've been very difficult.

26:32.882 --> 26:36.803
And I've realized that I have
a lot of anger built up inside me.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.850
Everything was going so well
between us, and then...

26:43.184 --> 26:46.730
Lilly died and some drunk idiot
screwed up the rest of me.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.358
Sometimes life deals us a bad hand.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.446
That doesn't mean it's okay
to take out your frustrations

26:54.529 --> 26:56.406
-on the people who love you.
-I know.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.784
And I know I haven't been fair to you.

27:01.244 --> 27:05.540
My accident, Lilly's death,
they happened to you too.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.462
The only way
we're gonna get through it all is...

27:11.755 --> 27:12.589
UAW.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.799
UAW.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.012
Us Against the World.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.725
It's been a long time
since I've heard you say that.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.477
I want us to get back there.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.979
To us being a team.

27:28.063 --> 27:32.025
If you really believe that,
then we need to set some ground rules.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.363
-It's not okay for you to lie.
-Agreed.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.531
And you need
to take better care of yourself,

27:38.615 --> 27:40.909
which includes
keeping up on all your appointments.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.411
I'm going to be a model patient.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.288
I will hold you to that.

27:46.247 --> 27:48.917
Things will get better between us,
you'll see.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.634
-Oh.
-Hi.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.719
Hope, I need to talk to Mel for a minute.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.638
-Can I catch up with you?
-Okay.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.057
-Bye, Mel.
-Bye.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.813
Um, what do you wanna talk to me about?

28:11.106 --> 28:13.441
What is all this business
about the drug cabinet?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.985
And Cameron's talking about some mystery?

28:16.069 --> 28:18.446
It-- It's my practice.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.366
If something's going on,
I need to know about it.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.327
You're right. You're right. Um...

28:27.497 --> 28:30.125
I found Denny
in the drug cabinet last night.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.961
He said he was looking for aspirin.

28:33.712 --> 28:37.215
Denny? Why didn't you tell me
about that this morning?

28:37.298 --> 28:38.883
I know, I should have.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.637
I was going to,
and then Denny asked me not to,

28:42.721 --> 28:44.973
and I know how excited you've been
to get to know him,

28:45.056 --> 28:47.517
and I just don't wanna ruin that,

28:47.600 --> 28:51.688
and I was really hoping that
either you or Cameron had left it open.

28:52.313 --> 28:55.859
I appreciate
that you had my best interests at heart,

28:56.693 --> 28:59.612
but it is not your job to manage me.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.284
I know. I'm so sorry. I was really
just trying to do the right thing.

29:05.869 --> 29:11.583
Well, it would have been helpful
if you had told me when it happened,

29:11.666 --> 29:14.294
so when Hope invited Denny
to stay with us,

29:15.128 --> 29:17.589
I could have stalled
until I got to the bottom of this.

29:18.339 --> 29:19.716
I'm so sorry.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.721
-We'll figure it out.
-Okay.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.836
At long last, the knight's duel.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.091
On one side, we have King John.

30:06.137 --> 30:09.474
He is your champion three years running.

30:11.267 --> 30:14.521
And on the other side,
we have Sir Sheridan.

30:17.524 --> 30:23.154
And he uses guile and cunning to make up
for what he lacks in land and title.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.750
En garde, Sheridan.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.210
King John.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.060
A flower.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.564
-My lady.
-Me?

31:01.401 --> 31:05.154
My ladies.

31:11.494 --> 31:12.453
Ooh!

31:36.352 --> 31:38.855
Oh, is this yours?

31:38.938 --> 31:39.856
Why, thank you.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.864
Away with you, you villainous toad.

31:48.823 --> 31:54.245
Oh, so you need your squire
to fight your battles for you, do you?

31:54.329 --> 31:55.163
Sheridan.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.040
Come on.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.888
You're a bad man!

32:12.805 --> 32:16.517
Who's the toad now, boy?

32:19.896 --> 32:21.022
I'm not scared.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.277
Lonergan!

32:30.865 --> 32:32.825
Just hang in there. Okay?

32:32.909 --> 32:35.286
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just hang in there.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.289
I'm not scared.

32:39.999 --> 32:43.211
-There's nothing to be scared of, kid.
-<i>Jack, that's not the line.</i>

32:44.420 --> 32:46.047
Jack, that's not your line.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.800
Jack, what are you doing?

33:19.747 --> 33:20.581
Hey.

33:22.041 --> 33:22.875
You okay?

33:29.424 --> 33:34.387
When you went to see Lonergan's parents,
they ever ask why I didn't go that day?

33:36.389 --> 33:37.223
Yeah.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.435
What did you tell them?

33:41.352 --> 33:43.396
That it was too much for you.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.735
They never blamed you. Not for a second.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.738
Neither did any of us guys
who were there that day.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.198
Right.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.952
I just wish
you could let yourself off the hook.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.039
I don't know how.

34:04.000 --> 34:04.834
That's okay.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.212
Find someone who can help you.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.857
You were an incredible Juliet.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.068
Thanks.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.863
You're super talented.
Did you do theater in high school or...?

34:33.946 --> 34:37.617
-Um, no, that was my first time on-stage.
-Wow.

34:37.700 --> 34:40.912
You've got, like, a spark.
You could totally be an actress.

34:40.995 --> 34:43.456
Oh, I don't have the face for acting.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.874
Are you being serious?

34:46.334 --> 34:47.543
You're beautiful.

34:49.295 --> 34:52.131
Denny, if you think I'm so pretty,

34:52.215 --> 34:54.509
-then why aren't you interested?
-What?

34:54.592 --> 34:58.805
Sometimes you act like you wanna be
with me and then you... You back off.

34:59.347 --> 35:04.811
No, I am interested,
I just can't be with anyone right now.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.438
Guys say that
when they don't wanna hurt your feelings.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.898
No, I'm not doing that.

35:11.818 --> 35:12.860
I like you.

35:15.113 --> 35:15.947
For real.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.075
Then why haven't you done
anything about it?

35:19.659 --> 35:23.079
Because the timing's just not right.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.997
-Then why are you here?
-I don't know.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.669
I've tried,
but I can't stop thinking about you.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.914
I feel like
I just rinsed off a pound of dirt.

36:14.547 --> 36:15.798
You want anything?

36:17.049 --> 36:17.884
Some water.

36:21.721 --> 36:22.930
How was the maypole?

36:25.558 --> 36:28.936
We already talked about
the maypole at the fair, remember?

36:32.231 --> 36:33.941
That's right. I remember now.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.074
-My lady.
-Thanks.

36:51.918 --> 36:56.255
Jack, if you don't wanna talk to me
about whatever it is,

36:56.339 --> 36:58.841
I think you should talk to a therapist.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.636
You know, somebody that has experience.

37:01.719 --> 37:02.553
Experience.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.515
Experience with what?

37:06.599 --> 37:08.935
Watching someone you're responsible for

37:09.018 --> 37:11.479
bleeding out right in front of you,
that kind of thing?

37:12.480 --> 37:15.024
I know
what happened over there was brutal.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.527
So I want you to get help.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.283
Jack, you're hurting.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.204
I'm not, really. I'm...

37:31.499 --> 37:33.209
I'm wallowing. That's what I'm doing.

37:36.045 --> 37:40.675
I need to move on, so I don't think
talking about it is gonna help.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.302
That's not healthy.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.554
This?

37:47.014 --> 37:48.808
You think I have a problem, is that it?

37:53.479 --> 37:56.315
Look, it just takes the edge off.
That's all.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.903
Jack, I'm not judging you.

38:01.570 --> 38:02.405
Okay? I--

38:03.364 --> 38:04.198
I love you.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.953
-I just hate seeing you in pain.
-I love you too.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.581
Tomorrow is gonna be better. I promise.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.211
I'll be outside.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.480
You're late. You said 4.

38:38.357 --> 38:40.901
It's no fun waiting around
for something you need, is it?

38:41.986 --> 38:44.905
Look, the only reason I'm here
is to let you know,

38:44.989 --> 38:47.116
if you even so much as look at Brie,

38:47.658 --> 38:50.119
the next body they pull out of the woods
will be yours.

38:53.831 --> 38:54.707
Easy, cowboy.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.084
No need to get uptight.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.005
Hear me out.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.383
That raid took a big bite
out of our profits.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.385
It's time to refill the coffers.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.389
I need you to help me keep up appearances.

39:11.223 --> 39:14.769
So from 7 to 5,
it's business as usual, that's you.

39:15.686 --> 39:18.689
Then my boys
will come in and work this night shift.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.819
We got a fresh shipment of fentanyl
coming in next week.

39:24.403 --> 39:25.321
That was fast.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.865
You know what they say, time is money.

39:30.951 --> 39:31.786
So are you in?

39:32.995 --> 39:35.373
Or do I need to put you back in the pen?

39:36.749 --> 39:39.960
You stay away from Brie, we got a deal.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.591
Ain't love grand?

40:11.659 --> 40:16.705
<i>Dear Mom and Dad, I'm writing you</i>

40:23.796 --> 40:25.464
<i>They switched me to a new fireteam.</i>

40:26.215 --> 40:28.884

40:42.022 --> 40:44.442

40:44.525 --> 40:47.027
Shake a tail feather,
the 43rd needs our help. Let's go.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.362
Yes, First Sergeant.

40:48.446 --> 40:52.867
<i>I gotta run. Say hi to the Tim Man for me.</i>
<i>I miss you and I love you. Chris.</i>

41:38.829 --> 41:39.914
Ah.

41:41.040 --> 41:41.874
Jack.

41:44.543 --> 41:45.377
Jack?

41:50.049 --> 41:51.300
Ow.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.355
-<i>Mel?</i>
-Doc.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.984
I think
there's something wrong with my baby.
