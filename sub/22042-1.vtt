00:00.875 --> 00:03.677
- Last season I thought I'd
seen America's worst hotels.

00:03.677 --> 00:06.704
It's like being in Danny Devito's house.

00:06.704 --> 00:07.914
But I was wrong.

00:07.914 --> 00:09.989
This looks like a fucking prison.

00:09.989 --> 00:11.667
This season gets much,

00:11.667 --> 00:12.731
Holy fuck.

00:12.731 --> 00:13.600
Much.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.515
- Room 16 has a ghost in it.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.432
- Worse.

00:16.432 --> 00:17.300
(bright music)

00:17.300 --> 00:18.539
Why would I want to stay in here?

00:18.539 --> 00:19.913
- Life chances.

00:19.913 --> 00:21.281
(guest screaming)

00:21.281 --> 00:24.225
- Once again, I'm staying
in America's worst hotels.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.371
It's like mosaic of semen.

00:27.371 --> 00:28.587
So you don't have to.

00:28.587 --> 00:30.301
How would you describe the others?

00:30.301 --> 00:31.572
- Borderline sociopath.

00:31.572 --> 00:32.656
- Hotel? I'm in a jail.

00:32.656 --> 00:36.080
It definitely smells of a
business that's run by stoners.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.675
- I've been running my ass
off for three fucking days.

00:39.675 --> 00:41.583
- It's like dumber and dumber and dumbest.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.032
You're a fucking disgrace.

00:43.032 --> 00:44.012
- Oh, fuck off.

00:44.012 --> 00:46.504
- It's all coming out and going down

00:46.504 --> 00:47.978
this season on Hotel Hell.

00:49.255 --> 00:50.498
(bright music)

00:50.498 --> 00:53.490
Tonight, I check into a New Mexican hotel

00:53.490 --> 00:55.440
where the guests are
driven away by the owner,

00:55.440 --> 00:56.858
who thinks she's Cher.

00:56.858 --> 00:58.548
- I'm like an audio mirage.

00:58.548 --> 01:01.698
If a do a Cher tune, you're
gonna think you're hearing Cher.

01:01.698 --> 01:06.077
♪ If I could turn back time ♪

01:06.077 --> 01:10.028
♪ If I could find a way ♪

01:10.028 --> 01:12.311
- [Gordon] I've got to find
a way to save a sinking hotel

01:12.311 --> 01:13.646
with dreadful entertainment.

01:13.646 --> 01:16.962
- I would pay you 100 bucks not to sing.

01:16.962 --> 01:17.830
- Awful food.

01:17.830 --> 01:19.506
It's like the cat shat all over my plate.

01:19.506 --> 01:21.675
And a general manager
who can't be trusted.

01:21.675 --> 01:24.376
Does the general manager
bad mouth the owner

01:24.376 --> 01:25.244
behind her back?

01:25.244 --> 01:26.524
- Yes.

01:26.524 --> 01:27.743
- What an untrustworthy,

01:27.743 --> 01:30.265
backstabbing son of a bitch you are.

01:30.265 --> 01:33.567
(bright upbeat music)

01:58.003 --> 01:59.765
- [Gordon] The 14 bedroom Meson De Mesilla

01:59.765 --> 02:01.173
is a small boutique hotel

02:01.173 --> 02:03.998
located in the border town
of Las Cruces, New Mexico.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.814
It should be a wonderful
south western oasis,

02:06.814 --> 02:08.711
but the few guests that visit the hotel

02:08.711 --> 02:11.391
are in for an unpleasant surprise.

02:11.391 --> 02:12.935
Owner, Cali Szczawinski,

02:12.935 --> 02:15.760
purchased the former bed
and breakfast in 2006

02:15.760 --> 02:17.074
and completely remodelled it,

02:17.074 --> 02:19.097
putting her own
distinctive taste and style

02:19.097 --> 02:22.507
into every aspect, from the
food to the furnishings.

02:22.507 --> 02:24.196
- To me, it's very European.

02:24.196 --> 02:25.979
It's very Tuscan in nature.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.804
Maybe that's the venetian plaster,

02:27.804 --> 02:29.295
but I didn't really pick a style

02:29.295 --> 02:31.893
as much as I just picked
out things that I liked.

02:31.893 --> 02:34.581
- [Gordon] And one thing
Cali likes a lot is beige.

02:34.581 --> 02:38.366
The bedrooms are beige, big
beige and a little beige.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.534
- The walls are freaky.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.913
It looks like it is trying to
be marble, but it's plastic.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.218
- I do not believe the
customer is always right.

02:46.218 --> 02:47.709
- It's definitely not a place

02:47.709 --> 02:49.607
that I would feel comfortable staying.

02:49.607 --> 02:50.847
- Sometimes they're wrong.

02:50.847 --> 02:52.946
- How did you have it cooked, well?

02:52.946 --> 02:55.070
- She's pregnant and she wanted
to make sure it was well.

02:55.070 --> 02:55.939
- You know, the more you cook it

02:55.939 --> 02:57.174
the worse flavour it'll have.

02:58.065 --> 03:00.722
- How is that chicken for
them, tender salad going?

03:00.722 --> 03:03.996
- Cali made the menu and
we only serve Tuscan food.

03:03.996 --> 03:06.843
I don't even know if Cali
has ever been to Italy.

03:06.843 --> 03:07.711
- 86 Bruschetta.

03:07.711 --> 03:10.693
- I told you guys forever,
that was an awful recipe.

03:11.952 --> 03:14.308
- [Gordon] But it may not
be the bad food or the decor

03:14.308 --> 03:15.852
that's keeping guests away.

03:15.852 --> 03:17.760
(gentle music)

03:17.760 --> 03:18.823
- My mother was a bartender

03:18.823 --> 03:20.294
and she would have me sing to people

03:20.294 --> 03:22.681
and they paid attention
to me and they liked me.

03:22.681 --> 03:23.550
I live for applause.

03:23.550 --> 03:26.696
- [Gordon] Cali tried to make
it as a professional singer,

03:26.696 --> 03:28.208
but when her career stalled,

03:28.208 --> 03:30.700
she found her own personal concert venue.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.733
- I bought the hotel to sing.

03:32.733 --> 03:34.600
The audience members really like me a lot.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.046
I'm like an audio mirage.

03:37.046 --> 03:40.261
If I do a Cher tune, you're
gonna think you're hearing Cher.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.767
If you're not looking at
me, you think I am Cher.

03:47.176 --> 03:50.370
♪ If I could find a way ♪

04:00.094 --> 04:02.638
- We get a lot of telephone
calls, is Cali singing tonight?

04:02.638 --> 04:04.260
Well, then that kind
of means they like it.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.541

04:06.541 --> 04:07.409

04:07.409 --> 04:08.863
I think I surprise them quite a bit,

04:08.863 --> 04:10.124
because they just don't expect it.

04:10.124 --> 04:14.118
♪ If I could turn back time ♪

04:14.118 --> 04:16.175
Give me just a second here.

04:17.142 --> 04:18.851
After that song I need a little drink.

04:18.851 --> 04:20.437
- Me too.

04:20.437 --> 04:21.305
- [Gordon] Two months ago,

04:21.305 --> 04:23.920
Cali hired local
restaurateur Zan Steinberg

04:23.920 --> 04:25.327
as her new general manager.

04:25.327 --> 04:26.863
- Ladies, how are we?

04:26.863 --> 04:28.560
Just checking who's checking in.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.999
- [Gordon] Zan's wife Mitzi,

04:29.999 --> 04:32.001
has been working with Cali
since the hotel opened.

04:32.001 --> 04:33.648
- In the beginning my husband Zan

04:33.648 --> 04:35.848
and Cali's relationship was very good.

04:35.848 --> 04:39.592
Has it deteriorated? Oh, much.

04:39.592 --> 04:40.937
- Where are the keys?

04:40.937 --> 04:41.948
How can I get anything done

04:41.948 --> 04:44.419
if that bastard won't put shit back.

04:44.419 --> 04:45.991
Zan is the biggest problem here right now

04:45.991 --> 04:46.922
and that's unfortunate,

04:46.922 --> 04:48.611
because I brought him on to help me

04:48.611 --> 04:50.168
with what I thought the
biggest problem was,

04:50.168 --> 04:51.979
that we don't have enough customers.

04:51.979 --> 04:53.908
Some kind of general manager he is.

04:53.908 --> 04:57.182
- Cali should be fired
for being a poor operator

04:57.182 --> 04:59.685
and digging this thing into a hole.

04:59.685 --> 05:00.832
- [Gordon] With ownership and management

05:00.832 --> 05:04.419
not on the same page, the
guests are the ones that suffer.

05:04.419 --> 05:05.996
- How is everything here?

05:05.996 --> 05:08.141
- We're basically ready
to get our food to go,

05:08.141 --> 05:09.663
because we've waited so long.

05:09.663 --> 05:11.738
- Okay. Let me take care of this.

05:11.738 --> 05:13.188
- Cali believes that the customers

05:13.188 --> 05:14.741
have a place in her hotel,

05:14.741 --> 05:17.796
but Cali's at the tippy
top of that pyramid.

05:17.796 --> 05:19.590
- [Cali] I do not enjoy going up to tables

05:19.590 --> 05:22.666
and having something wrong at
every fucking table I get to.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.478
I don't like it at all.

05:27.296 --> 05:29.527
- [Gordon] Hotel bookings have
fallen to an all time low,

05:29.527 --> 05:30.549
and for much of the year

05:30.549 --> 05:33.312
not one of the 14 bedrooms has a guest in.

05:33.312 --> 05:34.824
If things don't change fast,

05:34.824 --> 05:36.795
the hotel will be forced to close.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.327
- Someone needs to be able to tell me

05:38.327 --> 05:40.319
what it is I'm doing wrong.

05:40.319 --> 05:43.263
Everything that I have is
tied up into the hotel.

05:44.977 --> 05:46.408
(soft music)

05:46.408 --> 05:48.752
I need Gordon's help badly.

05:48.752 --> 05:51.273
(soft music)

05:53.478 --> 05:55.397
- My first time in New Mexico.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.973
I'm in Las Cruces in the south
west desert and look at it.

05:58.973 --> 06:00.965
I mean, absolutely stunning.

06:00.965 --> 06:03.498
On the way to the Meson De Mesilla.

06:03.498 --> 06:06.366
Now, this is a small boutique hotel.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.399
Possibly the perfect getaway.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.631
- [ Robot] You have arrived
at your destination.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.758
- You're kidding me. I
mean, this is a joke.

06:12.758 --> 06:15.646
You've arrived and look yeah,
I'm at a fucking pile of sand.

06:15.646 --> 06:17.085
- [ Robot] Turn around when possible.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.952
- This is crazy. It doesn't make sense.

06:19.952 --> 06:21.819
- [ Robot] You have arrived
at your destination.

06:21.819 --> 06:22.871
- Is that it there?

06:22.871 --> 06:23.739
- [ Robot] Turn around when possible.

06:23.739 --> 06:24.957
- Turn around?

06:24.957 --> 06:26.282
- You'd think they'd have
a decent sign on there,

06:26.282 --> 06:28.211
wouldn't you, it looks like a prison.

06:29.691 --> 06:30.663
Finally.

06:30.663 --> 06:32.816
(bright music)

06:32.816 --> 06:33.841
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:33.841 --> 06:35.520
Welcome to Meson De Mesilla.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.389
- It's good to see you.

06:36.389 --> 06:38.533
So, who's favourite colour is beige?

06:38.533 --> 06:39.983
- Well, Cali was the decorator.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.172
- Cali is the?

06:41.172 --> 06:42.600
- Cali is the owner.
- Yeah, right.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.469
- This is our cleaning agreement.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.332
If you could read and sign it please.

06:45.332 --> 06:47.323
- Cleaning agreement?
- Yes. Just so you don't-

06:47.323 --> 06:48.888
- I'm not coming for a job or detox.

06:48.888 --> 06:51.202
- Just so you don't damage
our property, this is a,

06:51.202 --> 06:53.101
- Damage your property?
- Yes.

06:53.101 --> 06:56.761
The owner's very concerned
about the venetian plaster.

06:56.761 --> 06:58.637
- The owner's very concerned about the?

06:58.637 --> 07:00.287
- Venetian plaster.

07:01.223 --> 07:03.298
- And she wants me to sign a waiver,

07:03.298 --> 07:04.166
- Yes sir.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.175
- To say that I won't damage it.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.071
- Yes sir.

07:06.071 --> 07:07.271
- Does everyone have to sign these?

07:07.271 --> 07:08.209
- Everyone, yes.

07:08.209 --> 07:09.856
- Why would I sign a waiver?

07:09.856 --> 07:12.179
- I'm not sure why you'd
want to sign a waiver.

07:12.179 --> 07:14.486
Now sir-
- I'm not gonna sign that.

07:14.486 --> 07:15.745
By the way, welcome. Good to see you.

07:15.745 --> 07:17.333
What a first impression.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.418
- I don't believe that
there needs to be a waiver.

07:19.418 --> 07:20.867
I just do what I'm told.

07:20.867 --> 07:22.463
- Who put all these things on there?

07:22.463 --> 07:24.319
It doesn't look like New Mexico to me.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.727
- It sure doesn't. Maybe Italian?

07:26.727 --> 07:27.882
- Well, I have two restaurants in Italy

07:27.882 --> 07:30.763
and my restaurants haven't
got pictures of Mexico.

07:30.763 --> 07:33.630
Bloody hell. Let's go up to the room.

07:33.630 --> 07:35.674
Do I have a sign a waiver
to walk on the carpet?

07:35.674 --> 07:37.217
- No sir.
- Look, that was not me.

07:37.217 --> 07:39.294
It looks like someone's pooped on my wall.

07:39.294 --> 07:41.670
- [Anne] Oh no. The fireplace.

07:41.670 --> 07:42.858
- A fireplace.

07:42.858 --> 07:43.786
Just exactly what you need

07:43.786 --> 07:45.465
in the middle of the fucking desert?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.841
Do you have any alternate rooms?

07:46.841 --> 07:49.156
I'd love to move if it was less beige.

07:49.156 --> 07:50.439
- All the rooms are gonna be the same.

07:50.439 --> 07:52.044
- Oh shit. Well thank you.

07:52.044 --> 07:52.913
I'm gonna unpack.

07:52.913 --> 07:53.856
Are you gonna leave me
alone, on my own in my room.

07:53.856 --> 07:55.496
Do I need to sign a waiver?

07:55.496 --> 07:56.799
- No sir.
- No.

07:56.799 --> 07:57.668
Nice to meet you, by the way.

07:57.668 --> 07:58.742
- Nice to meet you too Gordon.

07:58.742 --> 07:59.787
- Thank you.

07:59.787 --> 08:02.480
(gentle music)

08:04.036 --> 08:05.694
- This room is so bland,

08:05.694 --> 08:07.372
it looks more like an airport hotel

08:07.372 --> 08:09.684
than a fun weekend getaway
in the heart of New Mexico.

08:09.684 --> 08:12.909
I can't wait to meet
the woman behind this.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.778
Hello.

08:13.778 --> 08:15.839
- Hi. Welcome to the sun.

08:15.839 --> 08:16.861
- Gordon.

08:16.861 --> 08:17.987
- Cali.
- Cali, good to see you.

08:17.987 --> 08:18.894
- Good to see you too.

08:18.894 --> 08:20.865
- I thought that you'd be wearing beige

08:20.865 --> 08:23.086
with the lady that's in
love with beige everywhere.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.076
- I do like beige.

08:24.076 --> 08:25.258
My favourite colour is beige,

08:25.258 --> 08:28.299
because I think beige
goes with a lot of things.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.332
- I didn't sign a waiver.

08:29.332 --> 08:31.355
Sending that message out to
every customer coming in here

08:31.355 --> 08:32.981
is not a good sign to begin with.

08:32.981 --> 08:34.931
- Well, at $7.50 a square foot

08:34.931 --> 08:36.490
to replace the venetian plaster,

08:36.490 --> 08:39.539
it can be a lot if
someone does some damage.

08:39.539 --> 08:41.448
- Why don't you show me around?

08:41.448 --> 08:43.212
- I would love to show you around.

08:45.494 --> 08:46.776
This is the main dining room.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.914
- [Gordon] How many seats
have you got in here?

08:47.914 --> 08:48.782
- 89.

08:48.782 --> 08:49.884
- What do have upstairs?

08:49.884 --> 08:51.239
- It's a stage where I perform.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.398
- Oh wow, amazing. And
customers, guitarists?

08:54.398 --> 08:56.599
- No, actually right now I sing to tracks.

08:56.599 --> 08:58.158
- So, you have like, a backing
track and you sing over that?

08:58.158 --> 08:59.862
- I do. Yes, yes I do.

08:59.862 --> 09:02.563
- Okay. Well, well, well.

09:02.563 --> 09:04.356
And this is the bar?
- This is the bar.

09:04.356 --> 09:05.268
- Over there we have another stage.

09:05.268 --> 09:07.554
- Yeah, I usually sing in
here on Fridays and Saturdays.

09:07.554 --> 09:09.966
- Okay, and who else performs here?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.249
- No one else.

09:11.249 --> 09:12.117
- None?

09:13.073 --> 09:15.555
Wow, wow, wow. And then through here?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.932
Seriously? What's all
that shit in the pool?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.319
- [Cali] Well, that's
from the pool cleaner

09:19.319 --> 09:20.623
who was supposed to be here this morning.

09:20.623 --> 09:21.491
He's a little bit late.

09:21.491 --> 09:22.360
- [Gordon] Is it busy, the pool?

09:22.360 --> 09:24.714
- [Cali] No, it's not. Very
seldom do people use the pool.

09:24.714 --> 09:25.888
- Really, mind you,

09:25.888 --> 09:27.984
I suppose it's like going
for a swim in a prison.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.228
Jesus Christ, what's at the back there?

09:31.228 --> 09:32.614
- [Cali] That's for entertainment.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.813
- [Gordon] My God, three stages?

09:33.813 --> 09:35.964
- I sing everywhere in the hotel.

09:36.899 --> 09:39.193
I love to sing period.

09:39.193 --> 09:42.061
- Three stages? I hope there's
no stage in the kitchen.

09:42.937 --> 09:43.927
Hello.
- Hi.

09:43.927 --> 09:44.928
- How are you?
- Good. Ceara.

09:44.928 --> 09:46.046
- This is .
- Ceara, nice to see you.

09:46.046 --> 09:46.915
- You too.
- Likewise.

09:46.915 --> 09:47.837
Where are you from?

09:47.837 --> 09:48.995
- I'm from New Mexico.

09:48.995 --> 09:50.714
- Oh nice. A local girl. Excellent.

09:50.714 --> 09:53.166
Is the cuisine New Mexican?

09:53.166 --> 09:56.325
- No. There's nothing here
that's New Mexican at all, no.

09:56.325 --> 09:58.796
- This is all very confusing.

09:58.796 --> 10:00.256
I'm looking forward to
tasting the food later,

10:00.256 --> 10:01.716
anyway, whatever it is.

10:01.716 --> 10:02.748
Let's catch up with the bar, shall we?

10:02.748 --> 10:03.989
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

10:03.989 --> 10:06.241
I like to cook south western cuisine.

10:06.241 --> 10:08.744
It's like, I don't know
why we have Tuscan food.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.310
- As the owner, in your mind
what's wrong with the place?

10:12.310 --> 10:14.764
- Well, we don't have enough customers.

10:14.764 --> 10:17.110
- And you have it now since?
- 2006.

10:17.110 --> 10:17.979
- How much did it cost?

10:17.979 --> 10:19.028
- $1.2 million.
- Wow.

10:19.028 --> 10:21.141
- And that's what I purchased it for.

10:21.141 --> 10:22.877
- How much did you spend converting it?

10:22.877 --> 10:25.348
- Another 1.2 million.

10:25.348 --> 10:27.825
- 3.5 million. Bloody hell.

10:27.825 --> 10:29.860
- I shut down for 14 months to remodel it.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.473
- 14 months shutdown?

10:31.473 --> 10:33.664
- Yeah. It wasn't
supposed to be 14 months.

10:33.664 --> 10:35.103
It was supposed to four.

10:35.103 --> 10:37.853
It turned it into 14 months
and 1.2 million to do it

10:37.853 --> 10:39.691
and the contractor was indicted.

10:39.691 --> 10:40.943
- Bloody hell.

10:40.943 --> 10:42.353
- I've gone a lot of stuff with this hotel

10:42.353 --> 10:44.258
and it's like I'm starting to think

10:44.258 --> 10:47.272
maybe the problem is
I'm just too trusting.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.828
- How long can you
continue putting money in?

10:49.828 --> 10:54.727
- Oh, I've got maybe 60,000, $70,000 left.

10:54.727 --> 10:57.000
- So, for the next six months max?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.399
- Yeah, unless it kicks up.

11:00.399 --> 11:02.620
- Listen, I'm here to help

11:02.620 --> 11:05.311
and I'm sorry it's been as difficult.

11:05.311 --> 11:08.867
- Yes, as you can see, I'm
really glad you're here.

11:08.867 --> 11:11.735
(cheerful music)

11:13.308 --> 11:15.039
- I've just arrived at Meson De Mesilla

11:15.039 --> 11:16.760
and I'm confused by this hotel.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.628
Who put all these things on there?

11:17.628 --> 11:19.846
It doesn't look like New Mexico to me.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.715
- [Anne] It sure doesn't.

11:20.715 --> 11:22.578
- [Gordon] I met Cali
the owner and she told me

11:22.578 --> 11:24.747
she'd desperate for this place to succeed.

11:24.747 --> 11:26.210
- I'm really glad you're here.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.491
- So, I'm keen to meet the general manager

11:29.491 --> 11:32.619
and see why he's let this
place fail on his watch.

11:32.619 --> 11:33.618
Now, are you the general manager?

11:33.618 --> 11:34.487
- I'm the general manager.

11:34.487 --> 11:35.935
- And how long have you
been working in hotels?

11:35.935 --> 11:37.343
- Hotels will be nine weeks.

11:37.343 --> 11:38.211
I've never been in a hotel,

11:38.211 --> 11:39.793
but I've always been in restaurants,

11:39.793 --> 11:41.336
full service restaurants.

11:41.336 --> 11:44.996
- How does a restaurant
manager become qualified

11:44.996 --> 11:46.717
to be a general manager of a hotel

11:46.717 --> 11:48.083
when you've never worked
in a hotel before?

11:48.083 --> 11:49.459
- It's not that complicated.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.328
Take care of the guests,
check them into a room.

11:50.328 --> 11:51.631
- It's not that complicated?

11:52.525 --> 11:53.703
- I don't believe it is.

11:53.703 --> 11:55.017
I can do the work.

11:55.017 --> 11:55.885
It's not that hard.

11:55.885 --> 11:57.892
There's only like, six,
seven things I need to learn.

11:57.892 --> 11:59.080
- What are the major problems?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.741
- The major problem is Cali is the owner.

12:00.741 --> 12:02.149
- She's the major problem.
- The major problem.

12:02.149 --> 12:06.080
She is too controlling and
my hands are being tied.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.519
- If you're not being allowed

12:07.519 --> 12:11.526
to do the job you came in
to do, why are you here?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.623
- I'm here because I'm
emotionally vested in the place.

12:15.623 --> 12:16.986
- How can you be emotionally invested

12:16.986 --> 12:18.300
when you've only been here nine weeks?

12:18.300 --> 12:20.000
- Well, my wife's been
here all these years.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.293
Anytime somebody calls in sick,

12:21.293 --> 12:22.628
the first person they call is Mitzi

12:22.628 --> 12:24.796
and we've always thought it's a goldmine.

12:24.796 --> 12:26.204
We just can't figure out

12:26.204 --> 12:27.820
why we can't get people in the seats.

12:27.820 --> 12:29.614
The only way for Meson to be successful

12:29.614 --> 12:31.459
is for Cali to back out.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.482
- What are these things here?

12:33.482 --> 12:34.692
- [Zan] The vinyl?

12:34.692 --> 12:36.266
- It's disgusting.

12:36.266 --> 12:38.101
In fact, can we take
this off? Do you mind?

12:38.101 --> 12:39.561
Instantly that looks better, right?

12:39.561 --> 12:40.430
You do not need to be a general manager

12:40.430 --> 12:41.967
to make that decision, do you?

12:41.967 --> 12:43.408
- No.
- Is there a server?

12:43.408 --> 12:44.276
- I will bring a server
up for you right now.

12:44.276 --> 12:46.287
- Great, and his or her name?

12:46.287 --> 12:48.194
- [Zan] Mitzi.
- Mitzi. Oh, it's your wife?

12:48.194 --> 12:49.477
- Yes.
- How are you?

12:49.477 --> 12:50.530
- Good. How are you?

12:50.530 --> 12:51.625
- Let's order first, shall we?

12:51.625 --> 12:53.377
- Okay.
- And then we'll have a chat.

12:53.377 --> 12:54.969
- All right. What would you like?

12:54.969 --> 12:56.901
- We are in New Mexico, aren't we?

12:56.901 --> 12:57.770
- Yes, we are in Los Cruces.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.936
- And I landed taste of Tuscany.

12:59.936 --> 13:00.804
- Yes.

13:00.804 --> 13:02.824
- Why wouldn't you just
go for modern stunning

13:02.824 --> 13:04.711
delicious Mexican cuisine?

13:04.711 --> 13:07.068
- I guess it's because she
thinks there's enough of them.

13:07.068 --> 13:07.936
- That's crazy.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.394
The Bruschetta looks good.

13:10.394 --> 13:11.263
- [Mitzi] Okay.

13:11.263 --> 13:13.553
- The Chicken Piccata.
That sounds interesting.

13:13.553 --> 13:14.422
- Okay.

13:14.422 --> 13:16.428
- The Lamb Lollipops. Well,
it's not cheap, is it?

13:16.428 --> 13:18.788
$23 for them lollipops.

13:18.788 --> 13:20.706
Thank you my darling.

13:20.706 --> 13:22.371
Bloody hell.

13:22.371 --> 13:24.773
- I've got the Bruschetta.

13:24.773 --> 13:27.015
- I know good food. Thank you so much.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.039
- No problem.
- Our food is really good.

13:30.039 --> 13:30.907
- To be forewarned.

13:30.907 --> 13:33.521
- It's like the cat
shat all over my plate.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.815
Bruschetta normally goes with tomatoes.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.005
- Yes, and this is olives and anchovies.

13:38.005 --> 13:41.008
- Popular, is this?
- No.

13:41.008 --> 13:43.716
- It's like vomit that.
There you go sweet.

13:45.655 --> 13:46.558
Phew, dear oh dear.

13:46.558 --> 13:48.620
Words got out that I'm in town

13:48.620 --> 13:50.802
and the restaurant is starting
to fill up with customers.

13:50.802 --> 13:52.259
- Would you come this way please?

13:52.259 --> 13:54.125
- I feel sorry for all of them.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.472
Wow.There you go, my $22 Lollipops.

13:57.472 --> 13:58.341
You're the longest member of staff here,

13:58.341 --> 14:00.590
what do you think is
wrong with this place?

14:00.590 --> 14:02.352
- I think Cali's reputation.

14:02.352 --> 14:03.666
- Is it that bad?

14:03.666 --> 14:05.918
- She's rude.
- She's rude.

14:05.918 --> 14:10.119
- She's brass, she's
short, she's not flexible.

14:10.119 --> 14:12.298
I think you get the picture.

14:12.298 --> 14:13.679
- Thank you my darling.

14:13.679 --> 14:16.960
Blimey, not what I'd
call a loyal workforce.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.392
It's all fat. $23. Dreadful.

14:21.997 --> 14:23.019
Tough as fuck.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.865
Do you like lamb?

14:25.865 --> 14:26.734
- I love lamb.

14:26.734 --> 14:27.826
- It's tough as anything.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.265
- [Zan] You're talking
perhaps a little rare.

14:29.265 --> 14:31.013
- A little tough? What is going on?

14:31.013 --> 14:33.029
I know you haven't got
much hotel experience,

14:33.029 --> 14:34.989
but isn't this your forte, restaurants?

14:34.989 --> 14:36.584
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.493
I'm finished with that. Thank you.

14:38.493 --> 14:40.317
I mean, dreadful, absolutely.

14:40.317 --> 14:41.694
You can tell. Is the lamb frozen?

14:41.694 --> 14:43.974
- The lamb comes frozen and we thaw a box.

14:43.974 --> 14:46.052
- Can you find out where it's from?

14:46.052 --> 14:47.491
- Yes.

14:47.491 --> 14:50.205
- Psst. Lamb Lollipops. No go.

14:52.538 --> 14:54.175
So far, nothing I've tasted

14:54.175 --> 14:56.187
has even a remote connection to the area.

14:56.187 --> 14:59.472
Nothing local, nothing
authentic, nothing New Mexican.

14:59.472 --> 15:02.384
- New Zealand.
- New Zealand lamb. Wow.

15:03.966 --> 15:06.583
- That part's right, that part's right.

15:06.583 --> 15:09.555
- Our Chicken Piccata is non traditional.

15:09.555 --> 15:11.640
- Thank you for visiting us
here at Meson De Mesilla.

15:11.640 --> 15:12.537
My name is Cali.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.488
I'm gonna do just a little
music for you this afternoon.

15:15.488 --> 15:18.107
A little rock number from Cher.

15:18.107 --> 15:19.236
- I love her.

15:54.659 --> 15:57.613
- Hi. How are we? Nice to see you.

15:58.619 --> 16:02.615
I'm so sorry about the noise,
and it's not in the kitchen.

16:02.615 --> 16:04.518
It gets a little bit much.

16:04.518 --> 16:07.818
I'm not too sure what's more
scary, the food or the singing.

16:07.818 --> 16:09.934
What would you say?

16:09.934 --> 16:12.098
- I don't know. They complement
each other pretty well.

16:12.098 --> 16:16.008
- How are you ladies?
A fake bunch of grapes?

16:21.692 --> 16:24.646
(Gordon clapping)

16:26.204 --> 16:27.623
- [Cali] And thanks for joining us here.

16:27.623 --> 16:29.632
- Is that normal?
- Yes.

16:29.632 --> 16:31.272
- [Gordon] That's not
just because I'm here?

16:31.272 --> 16:32.419
- No.

16:32.419 --> 16:35.391
- She is not Cher. I am sorry.

16:35.391 --> 16:36.259
- [Cali] I love to sing.

16:36.259 --> 16:38.157
That's probably why I bought this place.

16:39.311 --> 16:42.763
- I've got to get away from
this horrendous singing.

16:42.763 --> 16:44.421
We haven't met yet, have we?
- Say again sir?

16:44.421 --> 16:45.422
- We haven't met yet, have we?

16:45.422 --> 16:46.360
- No sir. I'm David.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.473
- David, what do you do?

16:47.473 --> 16:49.624
- Yes sir, I'm a pantry.

16:49.624 --> 16:50.492
- Pantry?
- Yes sir.

16:50.492 --> 16:52.543
- Tell us, are you trained David?

16:52.543 --> 16:55.630
- Well, trained a little bit
sir. I've been around sir.

16:55.630 --> 16:58.038
- And where is your love
of food coming from?

16:58.038 --> 16:58.907
- My father.
- Your father.

16:58.907 --> 17:00.416
Your dad's a chef?
- No sir.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.334
My dad was a nurse, but he loved to eat.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.203
- Wow.

17:03.203 --> 17:06.166
- [Mitzi] I'm needing another
calamari with the remoulade.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.238
- [David] I have the second calamari

17:07.238 --> 17:08.541
starting right now ma'am.

17:09.455 --> 17:12.845
- Just two seconds. This is
already breaded and fried.

17:12.845 --> 17:14.127
- I'm gonna fry it right now sir.

17:14.127 --> 17:16.713
- That's already cooked.
- Yes sir.

17:16.713 --> 17:18.173
- So, when was it cooked?

17:18.173 --> 17:19.580
- Oh, actually we get it in a box sir.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.770
We get it from a fish company
sir. Completely frozen.

17:21.770 --> 17:22.656
- Just touch that.

17:22.656 --> 17:23.835
- Oh yes sir, it feels like rubber.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.170
I don't eat the fish here sir.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.935
- [Gordon] How come you know
this and you're still doing it?

17:26.935 --> 17:28.830
- My opinion doesn't
matter in this restaurant.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.457
- If you know it's bad and yet you just,

17:31.457 --> 17:32.712
I guess you will do it.

17:34.773 --> 17:36.838
- Life! (laughs)

17:36.838 --> 17:38.433
- [Gordon] Wow. I hope tonight's guests

17:38.433 --> 17:40.602
can remain as positive as David has.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.656
- If you can sign this here for me.

17:42.656 --> 17:43.806
It's just a cleaning agreement.

17:43.806 --> 17:45.676
- A what? A cleaning agreement?

17:45.676 --> 17:48.662
- It's just in case you do
throw red wine on our walls.

17:48.662 --> 17:50.382
- Does that happen?

17:50.382 --> 17:52.541
- [Anne] It has happened actually.

17:52.541 --> 17:54.032
- [Gordon] Unfortunately,
the guests checking in

17:54.032 --> 17:56.190
are getting the same
terrible welcome that I did.

17:56.190 --> 17:58.130
- If I could please have you read.

17:58.130 --> 18:00.747
- Good evening ladies,
welcome. Nice to see you both.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.615
- Thank you.

18:01.615 --> 18:02.999
- I'd like to apologise about the waiver.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.742
- All right, well you've
got to do, oh, oh, oh.

18:06.742 --> 18:08.619
- No throwing red wine on the walls.

18:09.495 --> 18:11.070
- Sign a cleaning agreement?
- Yes.

18:11.070 --> 18:12.728
- So, what does that mean like?

18:12.728 --> 18:14.698
Do the check off list when you come in

18:14.698 --> 18:17.754
and then do the check off list
when you exit in the morning?

18:17.754 --> 18:19.391
- Is there any other breakfast

18:19.391 --> 18:20.809
other than coffee in the morning?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.081
- No ma'am, there's no breakfast.

18:22.081 --> 18:24.510
- Is there room service or anything?

18:24.510 --> 18:25.379
- No ma'am.

18:25.379 --> 18:27.619
- And you're lucky you're
not hearing the singing.

18:27.619 --> 18:30.433
I'm going to head to the bar
for a quiet afternoon drink.

18:30.433 --> 18:33.248
Anymore singing and I feel
like my head might explode.

18:34.271 --> 18:35.601
Okay what is going on?

18:35.601 --> 18:36.469
The customers are having dinner.

18:36.469 --> 18:38.733
All of a sudden she
breaks into this music,

18:38.733 --> 18:42.466
totally unexpected and she
just sits there and absolutely,

18:42.466 --> 18:45.323
- Wails away with it.
- Yeah. What the fuck?

18:45.323 --> 18:47.523
Seriously, I've seen enough for one day.

18:47.523 --> 18:49.087
- You're just, you're gonna
have to lay that down somewhere.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.005
- Where's she going now?

18:50.005 --> 18:52.931
- She's gonna sing.
- No. Not in here?

18:52.931 --> 18:54.592
- Yes sir.
- You are kidding me.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.626
I thought these guests in
here were the lucky ones.

18:56.626 --> 18:57.835
- I did too.
- The same numbers?

18:57.835 --> 18:59.837
- The exact same.
- She's a nut job.

18:59.837 --> 19:01.103
- The exact same words, yeah.

19:01.103 --> 19:03.024
- My name is Cali, for
those of you who don't know.

19:03.024 --> 19:04.781
I do a little entertaining here.

19:04.781 --> 19:06.758
Are there any Cher fans in the audience?

19:06.758 --> 19:07.800
- Oh my God!

19:11.618 --> 19:12.486
(audience applauding)
- Hey, thank you.

19:12.486 --> 19:13.695
- We did a service and the terrible

19:13.695 --> 19:15.645
Calioke concert finally over,

19:15.645 --> 19:17.960
it's time to get the chef
and the management together

19:17.960 --> 19:20.914
and find out what on
earth is going on here.

19:24.529 --> 19:26.364
Let's get one thing absolutely certain,

19:26.364 --> 19:29.263
there is not a taste of Tuscany.

19:29.263 --> 19:31.302
It's not funny. It's cluster fuck.

19:31.302 --> 19:33.162
(tense music)

19:33.162 --> 19:35.205
So, are you proud of this?

19:35.205 --> 19:36.702
- No, I've told her.
- So, why are you doing it?

19:36.702 --> 19:39.043
- Because I'm not allowed
to change anything.

19:39.043 --> 19:40.357
- Oh my God!

19:40.357 --> 19:42.578
- I feel like there's
many pricing issues here.

19:42.578 --> 19:45.352
There are definitely
changes that have to happen.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.031
- You're amazing. It's
just total horse shit.

19:48.031 --> 19:49.627
It's just total horse shit.

19:49.627 --> 19:50.920
You know, it's just like,

19:50.920 --> 19:51.788
- Is he lying?

19:51.788 --> 19:52.901
- No, we work within the constraints

19:52.901 --> 19:53.802
that I'm allowed to work in.

19:53.802 --> 19:55.960
- Oh, restraints my ass.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.635
Constraints my ass.
- Pretty much.

19:57.635 --> 19:59.929
- So, you have done nothing
since you came in here

19:59.929 --> 20:02.191
but talk about me behind my back,

20:02.191 --> 20:05.538
try to set me up to
fail every fucking day.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.623
- Why do I want to make you look bad?

20:06.623 --> 20:07.582
- I don't know.
- No you don't.

20:07.582 --> 20:08.719
- I wish to hell I did know,

20:08.719 --> 20:10.450
but I've got several people we can line up

20:10.450 --> 20:11.739
and will tell exact what you said to them.

20:11.739 --> 20:13.692
- And I imagine we will, you know.

20:13.692 --> 20:15.830
I can hear the same thing about you.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.634
I'll leave and the only thing you'll say,

20:17.634 --> 20:21.282
the parting words, not to me
is, I hope he hangs himself.

20:21.282 --> 20:23.748
How horrible is that when
I'm doing an event here?

20:23.748 --> 20:24.617
- Well, I'll tell you how horrible it is.

20:24.617 --> 20:27.371
It's about as horrible as when
somebody hires all new people

20:27.371 --> 20:29.072
and tells each and every one of them

20:29.072 --> 20:31.398
that she's a bitch to work
for, you can't work with her,

20:31.398 --> 20:32.982
but hang in there because in six months

20:32.982 --> 20:34.859
I'll be running this
place and she'll be gone.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.444
I mean, literally right out of the box,

20:36.444 --> 20:37.643
right out of the box.

20:37.643 --> 20:38.512
- So there you go. That's
what it all goes back.

20:38.512 --> 20:39.687
- You have no.

20:39.687 --> 20:42.356
Yes, because that's when I
found out what an untrustworthy,

20:42.356 --> 20:44.351
backstabbing son of a bitch you are.

20:45.620 --> 20:49.132
I gotta worry about my
back continuously with you.

20:49.132 --> 20:50.001
- What?

20:50.001 --> 20:52.992
- This major miracle man that
was supposed to come in here

20:52.992 --> 20:54.775
and double and triple this business

20:54.775 --> 20:56.443
when there's been no change whatsoever.

20:56.443 --> 20:57.312
None.

20:57.312 --> 20:58.758
- Was I allowed to make any changes,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.222
like direct dramatically make any changes?

21:00.222 --> 21:02.470
- You wanted to hire new
people, which you did.

21:02.470 --> 21:03.339
- It's got to have some people.

21:03.339 --> 21:04.326
- Of course, you told
each and every one of them

21:04.326 --> 21:05.651
that they shouldn't work for me.

21:05.651 --> 21:07.531
- Oh, for God's sake. Is that true?

21:08.518 --> 21:10.301
- There was the impression given that Cali

21:10.301 --> 21:12.523
would no longer be here whenever
we were brought the orders.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.159
- Oh God, she owns the place.

21:14.159 --> 21:15.556
Why were you suggesting that

21:15.556 --> 21:18.104
she's not gonna be here
after Ceara starts?

21:19.404 --> 21:21.250
- I don't recall it.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.602
- Horse shit.
- Wow.

21:22.602 --> 21:23.470
- It just wasn't her.

21:23.470 --> 21:25.878
It wasn't her, it was
Annie, it was Christian,

21:25.878 --> 21:26.747
it was everybody.
- You all want to leave.

21:26.747 --> 21:27.620
- Oh my God!

21:27.620 --> 21:30.321
Does the general manager
bad mouth the owner

21:30.321 --> 21:31.218
behind her back?

21:31.218 --> 21:32.086
- Yes.

21:34.614 --> 21:35.514
- Of course she doesn't trust you,

21:35.514 --> 21:36.482
if you're gonna bad mouth
her behind her back.

21:36.482 --> 21:37.351
- Of course.

21:37.351 --> 21:39.090
- If you were the owner,
what would you do?

21:39.090 --> 21:41.801
- I would fire him, that
person that bad mouthed me.

21:43.253 --> 21:46.566
(tense music)

21:46.566 --> 21:47.435
- You're fired.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.252
- I think I'm leaving.
- What was that?

21:55.252 --> 21:56.434
- I was just fired.

21:57.735 --> 21:59.871
- Now Cali, I'm sorry
you've already failed

21:59.871 --> 22:01.133
and you need a fall guy.

22:01.133 --> 22:02.812
Okay, you got me. You run it.

22:02.812 --> 22:04.949
You step up to the plate. Good luck.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.077
- I'm leaving too. I'm out of here.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.578
I feel betrayed.

22:08.578 --> 22:12.214
And if the bitch thinks
I'm gonna stay, she's nuts.

22:12.214 --> 22:14.480
- You know, I don't mind Cali
yelling at me. It's fine.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.763
She finally got it off her fucking chest,

22:16.763 --> 22:18.567
but she doesn't trust anybody.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.413
You know, everybody's
burned her in her history.

22:20.413 --> 22:22.081
I don't know. I didn't burn her.

22:23.437 --> 22:24.521
- It felt good to fire him,

22:24.521 --> 22:27.305
because he's been a
cancer here at the hotel

22:27.305 --> 22:28.671
and now the tumour has been cut out

22:28.671 --> 22:30.788
and we're gonna be in better shape.

22:30.788 --> 22:33.937
- Zan's just been fired
and the level of animosity

22:33.937 --> 22:36.231
and the friction between
those two is extraordinary,

22:36.231 --> 22:38.768
but the question is what happens next?

22:42.380 --> 22:45.083
(bright upbeat music)

22:45.083 --> 22:46.262
- [Gordon] I had a rough night's sleep

22:46.262 --> 22:49.150
with that bloody Cher tune
going round and round my head.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.402
I'm hoping I can wash
that tune out of my brain

22:51.402 --> 22:52.758
with a quick swim.

22:52.758 --> 22:55.208
And that's not all I'd like to forget.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.752
My first day at meson was crazy.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.839
Within hours of my arrival
the general manager was fired.

23:00.839 --> 23:01.902
- What an untrustworthy,

23:01.902 --> 23:04.426
backstabbing son of a bitch you are.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.453
- And I'd endured torture by Calioke.

23:07.453 --> 23:12.204
♪ I really didn't mean to hurt you ♪

23:12.204 --> 23:14.383
Today has got to be better than yesterday.

23:14.383 --> 23:15.895
Let's hope the pool guy came.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.777
(tense music)

23:18.777 --> 23:20.277
The pool is still dirty.

23:20.277 --> 23:22.360
(tense music)

23:22.360 --> 23:23.792
What the hell is that?

23:24.828 --> 23:28.856
It's no joke. I mean, what
a badly utilised space.

23:28.856 --> 23:34.070
I mean, you think of a hotel
anywhere in New Mexico, God,

23:34.664 --> 23:37.479
one thing is an asset, it's a pool.

23:37.479 --> 23:39.398
I mean, this space could be the
best thing about this hotel,

23:39.398 --> 23:41.869
yet it's just abused, dirty.

23:41.869 --> 23:42.985
Not even a towel out here.

23:42.985 --> 23:46.085
So, I'm not gonna fucking swim in there.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.942
That's disgusting.

23:48.942 --> 23:51.549
(tense music)

23:53.564 --> 23:54.452
Breakfast.

23:54.452 --> 23:55.779
So, no morning swim for me,

23:55.779 --> 23:59.471
but at least I can enjoy a good
breakfast to start the day.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.515
My God. That's all they've got to offer.

24:02.515 --> 24:04.194
How depressing is that?

24:04.194 --> 24:05.612
This is crazy.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.259
I've got to find some breakfast.

24:07.259 --> 24:09.929
I'm starving and cold
coffee isn't going to do it.

24:09.929 --> 24:11.712
I've heard there's an amazing
farmer's market in town,

24:11.712 --> 24:14.382
so I'm gonna possibly check it out.

24:14.382 --> 24:17.572
(cheerful music)

24:17.572 --> 24:19.115
What a lovely little place.

24:19.115 --> 24:20.867
I've heard David from Meson's kitchen

24:20.867 --> 24:22.983
runs a food truck here in his spare time.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.579
No deep fried calamari I hope.

24:24.579 --> 24:26.320
I saw the line. I thought
wow. What are you serving?

24:26.320 --> 24:28.807
- We've got casadias.
The best in New Mexico.

24:28.807 --> 24:29.675
- Okay, brilliant.

24:29.675 --> 24:32.209
- I have a little food truck
with a buddy of mine Chris.

24:32.209 --> 24:33.651
A Little Taste Of New Mexico.

24:33.651 --> 24:35.788
(upbeat music)

24:35.788 --> 24:37.227
- This is one of our
favourites right here.

24:37.227 --> 24:38.843
Cucumber lime.
- It's perfect.

24:40.642 --> 24:42.618
At 100 degrees outside,
that's perfect right?

24:42.618 --> 24:43.983
- Yes, it is indeed.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.069
- My goodness. Now that's delicious.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.122
So, what's in the case there?

24:47.122 --> 24:49.896
- [Ramos] Cheese and chilli
and also feta cheese.

24:49.896 --> 24:51.043
Here you are my friend.

24:51.043 --> 24:51.911
- Thank you.

24:55.796 --> 24:56.904
That is delicious.

24:56.904 --> 24:58.386
Now David, that's better

24:58.386 --> 25:00.815
than anything I've eaten in
the hotel, do you know that?

25:00.815 --> 25:02.446
- Yes sir.
- It's delicious.

25:02.446 --> 25:03.314
- Thank you sir.

25:03.314 --> 25:04.890
Now, the food truck is my creative outlet.

25:04.890 --> 25:08.080
It's a place for me to at
least express my ideas,

25:08.080 --> 25:09.603
without having any borders.

25:09.603 --> 25:11.240
- Well done. I'll see you later.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.347
Good job. Delicious. Enjoy
the food guys. Thank you.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.649
(gentle upbeat music)

25:18.695 --> 25:21.239
This town is stunning, full
of charm and local colour.

25:21.239 --> 25:23.878
It's such a shame the hotel
reflects none of that.

25:23.878 --> 25:26.745
I've got to find a way to get
Cali to embrace new Mexico

25:26.745 --> 25:29.623
and make the most of what
her hotel has to offer.

25:29.623 --> 25:31.446
How are you feeling?

25:31.446 --> 25:32.314
- I feel okay.

25:32.314 --> 25:33.533
- I think it's important for you

25:33.533 --> 25:35.525
to understand the bigger picture.

25:35.525 --> 25:36.808
- Okay.
- Yeah.

25:36.808 --> 25:38.569
Can you come with me please? Thank you.

25:38.569 --> 25:41.857
Hopefully, what I have
planned will open Cali's eyes.

25:45.983 --> 25:47.873
Cali, this is some of your guests.

25:48.767 --> 25:50.832
I'd like you to share your experiences.

25:50.832 --> 25:52.239
Why don't we start off
with you first please.

25:52.239 --> 25:54.749
- The first impressions
are important to me

25:54.749 --> 25:55.917
and the very first thing I had to do

25:55.917 --> 25:58.131
was sign a cleaning waiver

25:58.131 --> 26:00.341
and it just makes the assumption

26:00.341 --> 26:02.228
that I'm not going to be clean.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.929
That assumption is just
a tough first impression.

26:04.929 --> 26:07.859
- He has a valid point.
Waivers are for bungee jumps.

26:07.859 --> 26:08.912
At your peril.

26:08.912 --> 26:10.841
- That whole thing for me wasn't to

26:10.841 --> 26:13.479
make you think that I didn't
think that you were clean.

26:13.479 --> 26:15.784
It was, I had someone come in

26:15.784 --> 26:17.713
and throw red wine all
over the venetian plaster

26:17.713 --> 26:19.965
and I thought that I should
charge them for that.

26:19.965 --> 26:20.833
- But you're punishing every other guest

26:20.833 --> 26:22.892
for the actions of one
guest and it's not right.

26:22.892 --> 26:26.127
You know, you can't
penalise future business

26:26.127 --> 26:27.431
on the back of one idiot.

26:28.817 --> 26:30.225
Sir.

26:30.225 --> 26:31.602
- It appears that there's no thought

26:31.602 --> 26:33.572
into what the customer
is going to experience.

26:33.572 --> 26:36.325
For instance, the first
thing on a hot day,

26:36.325 --> 26:38.223
you want to go into the pool

26:38.223 --> 26:41.482
and we looked out to
the pool and right now,

26:41.482 --> 26:43.614
it's the same way, it's got a
lot of leaves and it's dirty,

26:43.614 --> 26:44.719
so maybe it's not open.

26:44.719 --> 26:46.439
But how can it not be open?

26:46.439 --> 26:47.346
- [Gordon] He has a valid point.

26:47.346 --> 26:48.215
Madam, please.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.536
- We were in the lounge for dinner

26:49.536 --> 26:52.164
and when you were singing we
couldn't have a conversation.

26:52.164 --> 26:53.561
It's just not appropriate

26:53.561 --> 26:57.930
for an upscale intimate
fine dining experience.

26:57.930 --> 26:59.869
I thought you were very
focused on the performance,

26:59.869 --> 27:02.215
but you're not really
focused on your guests.

27:03.196 --> 27:04.728
- Very interesting. Sir.

27:04.728 --> 27:06.480
- Anything that goes
wrong with the restaurant

27:06.480 --> 27:08.899
when you're singing,
you're too busy singing

27:08.899 --> 27:10.891
and not caring about your guests.

27:10.891 --> 27:14.043
I would pay you 100 bucks not to sing.

27:16.011 --> 27:19.087
As long as you are focused
on your singing career

27:19.087 --> 27:21.891
and not on your restaurant
and hotel career,

27:21.891 --> 27:23.386
my wife and I won't be back.

27:26.323 --> 27:27.376
- I don't agree.

27:27.376 --> 27:30.171
I have quite a bit of people
that come here to hear me sing.

27:30.171 --> 27:31.443
- Guest feedback is critical.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.102
It's about turning that negativity
into something positive.

27:34.102 --> 27:35.415
Now, I'd like to introduce you

27:35.415 --> 27:37.879
to a very special lady, Nilou Motamed.

27:38.992 --> 27:42.537
She is the Features Director
and the Senior Correspondent

27:42.537 --> 27:44.920
of Travel and Leisure magazine.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.928
Nilou, give us an insight
into your stay please?

27:47.928 --> 27:49.315
- One of the things that we look at

27:49.315 --> 27:52.745
is whether a hotel has a sense of place.

27:52.745 --> 27:55.060
Whether it's maximising the value,

27:55.060 --> 27:57.980
that that beautiful
setting that it's in has.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.502
You mentioned the pool.

27:59.502 --> 28:01.890
That's one great example of a moment

28:01.890 --> 28:05.602
where you have a
potential great asset here

28:05.602 --> 28:10.252
that is being underutilised
and it's kinda underwhelming.

28:10.252 --> 28:12.359
There's a reason why hotel schools exist,

28:12.359 --> 28:15.799
so it's not a hobby, it's a business.

28:15.799 --> 28:17.781
- There is one question
I'd like to ask you all,

28:17.781 --> 28:20.700
would you come back to
stay in this hotel again?

28:20.700 --> 28:22.671
Please raise your hands.

28:22.671 --> 28:25.038
No one. Thank you to you all.

28:25.038 --> 28:28.531
Your feedback has been absolutely
pivotal. I appreciate it.

28:28.531 --> 28:30.418
- I was sending a message

28:30.418 --> 28:33.588
that I didn't realist I was
sending and didn't want to send.

28:33.588 --> 28:36.755
I want people to come here.
I want them to feel welcome.

28:36.755 --> 28:38.785
(gentle music)

28:38.785 --> 28:40.013
- Are you starting to understand?

28:40.013 --> 28:41.221
- I am.
- You are?

28:41.221 --> 28:42.357
- I am.

28:42.357 --> 28:44.245
- You were worrying
about the wrong things.

28:44.245 --> 28:49.114
The biggest issue you
have is understanding

28:49.114 --> 28:50.386
who's number one.

28:50.386 --> 28:54.328
The guests have to be
number one, not Cali.

28:54.328 --> 28:56.955
That's the bottom line.

28:56.955 --> 28:58.530
If you can change that,

28:58.530 --> 29:01.557
this place has every chance
of becoming a big success.

29:03.065 --> 29:04.519
Can you change?

29:04.519 --> 29:07.473
(uplifting music)

29:08.651 --> 29:10.302
- Will you help me?

29:11.324 --> 29:15.380
- I will help you, but you've
got to start listening.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.248
- I can do it.

29:17.922 --> 29:18.791
I can.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.532
(uplifting music)

29:20.532 --> 29:21.575
- I hope so.

29:23.743 --> 29:24.612
Coming up.

29:24.612 --> 29:26.065
- That's awesome.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.548
- [Gordon] The biggest transformation

29:27.548 --> 29:29.175
in the history of hotel hell.

29:29.175 --> 29:31.127
And a shocking twist.

29:31.127 --> 29:33.647
- [Cali] Where's all my shit?

29:34.923 --> 29:37.131
- [Gordon] It's been a tough
week at Meson De Mesilla,

29:37.131 --> 29:39.300
but I believe Cali is finally committed

29:39.300 --> 29:40.377
to putting her guests first.

29:40.377 --> 29:43.053
- I can do it. I can.

29:43.053 --> 29:44.951
- So, overnight my design team

29:44.951 --> 29:46.859
have pulled off an
incredible transformation,

29:46.859 --> 29:49.841
which I can't wait to share
with Cali and her staff.

29:49.841 --> 29:50.801
Are we ready?

29:50.801 --> 29:51.669
- [All] Yes sir.

29:51.669 --> 29:53.264
- Please turn around.

29:53.264 --> 29:56.198
- [Gordon] A stunning sign.

29:56.198 --> 29:57.630
(audience applauding)

29:57.630 --> 29:59.872
Now when you drive by, it tells you,

29:59.872 --> 30:03.105
- What we are. Meson De
Mesilla Hotel and Restaurant.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.909
- Gorgeous, right?
- Very.

30:04.909 --> 30:07.985
- Now, everybody that goes
by is not gonna wonder huh,

30:07.985 --> 30:10.675
I wonder who's nice house that is?

30:10.675 --> 30:12.201
- Are you ready to see inside?

30:12.201 --> 30:13.070
- [All] We are.

30:13.070 --> 30:16.106
- Because this you're
gonna absolutely love.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.827
(cheerful music)

30:17.827 --> 30:19.026
Good morning everybody.

30:20.226 --> 30:21.644
- Oh, way cool.

30:21.644 --> 30:24.647
- Welcome to your new
hotel breakfast buffet.

30:24.647 --> 30:26.753
Remember what breakfast used to be like?

30:26.753 --> 30:28.151
We have cold coffee.

30:28.151 --> 30:32.874
Now you have a very traditional,
stunning breakfast buffet.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.022
That will be served on crisp white linen.

30:35.022 --> 30:36.909
Not those horrible plastic clothes.

30:36.909 --> 30:38.672
And that's not all, I reached out

30:38.672 --> 30:42.373
and got an amazing local
talented breakfast chef.

30:42.373 --> 30:45.230
Let me introduce you to him.

30:45.230 --> 30:47.128
Meet David, our breakfast chef.

30:47.128 --> 30:49.342
- Wow, David.
- Hi David.

30:51.189 --> 30:52.696
- It's a wonderful thing.

30:52.696 --> 30:53.864
- I feel great right now.

30:53.864 --> 30:54.813
I'm learning the recipes

30:54.813 --> 30:57.273
and I'm really excited to
be in the kitchen right now.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.142
- Cali?
- Yes sir.

30:58.142 --> 31:00.638
- I think that's a much
better way of using that stage

31:00.638 --> 31:01.937
than a Calioke evening.

31:03.227 --> 31:04.096
Let's go.

31:05.062 --> 31:06.838
Welcome to your new suite.

31:09.875 --> 31:10.915
- Very cool.

31:12.337 --> 31:14.143
- Wow.
- It's very cool.

31:14.143 --> 31:15.012
- Wow.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.462
- Very, very cool.

31:19.462 --> 31:22.215
- So, we incorporated
some of the local colours

31:22.215 --> 31:24.707
and brought them into this boutique hotel.

31:24.707 --> 31:26.379
Cali, how are you feeling?

31:27.324 --> 31:31.422
- Amazed. Room 205 is an
amazing, amazing room.

31:31.422 --> 31:34.112
It's a New Mexico feel.

31:34.112 --> 31:36.021
- And I know it's not beige,
but you don't mind do you?

31:36.021 --> 31:38.648
- No, no, not at all. I
think it's gorgeous. I do.

31:38.648 --> 31:40.181
The walls are still beautiful

31:40.181 --> 31:42.173
and yet we have all this colour

31:42.173 --> 31:45.196
and it goes so well with
the area that we're in.

31:45.196 --> 31:47.532
- I've added colour, but there's
something I've taken away.

31:47.532 --> 31:49.982
There are no more waivers
for your guests to sign.

31:49.982 --> 31:51.004
Is that good with you Cali?

31:51.004 --> 31:51.873
- Good.

31:53.060 --> 31:53.945
- It's awesome.

31:53.945 --> 31:56.155
The front desk no longer has waivers

31:56.155 --> 31:57.949
and the new rooms are colourful.

31:57.949 --> 32:00.451
They fit with exactly where we are

32:00.451 --> 32:02.067
in this historic district.

32:02.067 --> 32:05.227
I am very proud to show
people the new rooms.

32:05.227 --> 32:08.462
- I've got one very small thing
to show you. Are you ready?

32:09.523 --> 32:10.722
This you're gonna love.

32:12.092 --> 32:13.856
- What's out here?

32:13.856 --> 32:17.030
(bright music)

32:17.030 --> 32:19.525
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God!

32:21.224 --> 32:24.621
- That's amazing.
- That's awesome.

32:24.621 --> 32:26.279
- Now that's what I call a pool.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.996
- Yes it is.
- Oh my God!

32:27.996 --> 32:30.419
- Remember, there was
leaves and crap everywhere.

32:30.419 --> 32:32.786
Now, welcome to one of the hippest,

32:32.786 --> 32:35.768
one of the coolest pools
anywhere in New Mexico.

32:35.768 --> 32:38.531
- [Carlos] That is the oasis
in the middle of the desert.

32:38.531 --> 32:40.377
- Gone is that hideous fence

32:40.377 --> 32:45.207
and replaced it with new turf
and pool furniture to die for.

32:46.383 --> 32:47.769
Beautiful.

32:47.769 --> 32:49.211
- It is. It is.

32:49.211 --> 32:50.241
(bright music)

32:50.241 --> 32:52.159
- People will just wanna
come and hang out here now.

32:52.159 --> 32:53.556
Wham bam, this is awesome.

32:53.556 --> 32:54.912
The pool, absolutely beautiful.

32:54.912 --> 32:56.247
I've never seen anything like it.

32:56.247 --> 32:59.761
If we don't have pool parties
now, then something's wrong.

32:59.761 --> 33:03.233
- This is your fantastic Cabana area.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.328
Gone is the stage.

33:04.328 --> 33:06.905
If you want to sing Cali,
do it in the shower.

33:06.905 --> 33:09.458
(all laughing)

33:09.458 --> 33:11.098
- Can I have a Margarita Carlos?

33:12.973 --> 33:14.650
- I'll be serving a
lot of drinks out here.

33:14.650 --> 33:18.435
- I'm hoping the business
is gonna absolutely kick off

33:18.435 --> 33:19.739
with this wonderful pool.

33:21.365 --> 33:24.890
Now that you have a stunning outside area,

33:24.890 --> 33:27.789
let me introduce you to
your new poolside menu.

33:27.789 --> 33:29.850
- Wow.
- Poolside.

33:31.407 --> 33:32.856
- So, you start off with a lovely

33:32.856 --> 33:34.420
refreshing Tomato Gazpacho.

33:34.420 --> 33:35.828
It's been marinated, seasoned and lovely

33:35.828 --> 33:37.329
with extra virgin olive oil.

33:37.329 --> 33:38.601
Fresh tacos as well.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.854
- Oh, I'm gonna eat all that.

33:40.854 --> 33:43.763
- And delicious fruit kebabs.
- Wow, this is great.

33:43.763 --> 33:45.754
- Wonderful fresh fruit.
Mango, orange, lime,

33:45.754 --> 33:47.287
coconut and seasoned

33:47.287 --> 33:49.352
with those wonderful green local chilies.

33:49.352 --> 33:52.563
A taste of New Mexico, not Tuscany Cali.

33:52.563 --> 33:56.411
- It's outstanding. The Tomato
Gazpacho is magnificent.

33:56.411 --> 33:57.944
- I'm very proud to cook this food.

33:57.944 --> 34:01.729
It makes sense and it goes with
New Mexico. It's excellent.

34:01.729 --> 34:03.418
- Have a good look at the menu.

34:03.418 --> 34:06.494
Get used to it, because we're
gonna be pushing it big time.

34:07.531 --> 34:08.516
I'll see you in a minute.

34:08.516 --> 34:09.996
This makeover is the biggest I've done

34:09.996 --> 34:11.676
in any of the hotels I've visited.

34:11.676 --> 34:14.679
There's over $150,000 worth of upgrades

34:14.679 --> 34:16.775
and I've never been happier
with the improvements.

34:16.775 --> 34:18.621
It's exactly what the guests need.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.657
If I was Cali, I'd be over the moon.

34:22.239 --> 34:23.428
- Green chilies, pecans,

34:23.428 --> 34:25.471
everything that New Mexico's
about, we have it on the menu.

34:25.471 --> 34:27.984
We have the guacamole, we have the salsa.

34:27.984 --> 34:29.955
- What do I do with the
five cases of hamburger buns

34:29.955 --> 34:31.446
that I just brought in?

34:31.446 --> 34:34.574
(suspenseful music)

34:35.804 --> 34:36.878
And even more.

34:36.878 --> 34:38.411
Hey, what do we want to spend an hour

34:38.411 --> 34:39.694
putting things away every night

34:39.694 --> 34:41.675
and then bring them out every morning?

34:43.156 --> 34:44.170
This is what Ramsay gave the hotel.

34:44.170 --> 34:47.054
Flavour, flavour, flavour, flavour.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.389
Who do I hire to do that?
This is a lot of work.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.676
I can't do this yet.

34:52.676 --> 34:55.188
- I love the calm.
- Deal with it.

34:57.087 --> 34:58.418
I've gotta go.

34:58.418 --> 34:59.969
(tense music)

34:59.969 --> 35:01.340
- [Carlos] Oh my God!

35:01.340 --> 35:02.943
- There's things that I'm concerned about.

35:02.943 --> 35:04.479
The pool is outstanding.

35:04.479 --> 35:05.866
It's scary to me,

35:05.866 --> 35:09.171
because I've got a pretty
big job ahead of me now

35:09.171 --> 35:12.803
and the linens, a major pain in the ass.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.585
There's so many things
that I'm gonna have to do,

35:16.585 --> 35:18.420
that right now, you know, I'm really like,

35:18.420 --> 35:19.289
freaking out over this

35:19.289 --> 35:22.570
and what I'm gonna do is raise the prices.

35:22.570 --> 35:24.760
- Cali is a little overwhelmed right now.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.169
I do believe she likes the fact
that it's more New Mexican.

35:28.169 --> 35:31.579
- Jesus, God Almighty.
- But Cali's Cali.

35:31.579 --> 35:32.750
- Where's all my shit?

35:34.113 --> 35:36.045
- Where's all my shit?
What does that mean?

35:36.045 --> 35:37.739
- All the other stuff that you took away.

35:37.739 --> 35:39.973
- All right, what stuff?
Tell me and I'll help you.

35:39.973 --> 35:41.589
- The tapestries.

35:41.589 --> 35:43.875
Oh, and I know you took
down all the grapes.

35:43.875 --> 35:44.905
- Yes.
- Because it was covering

35:44.905 --> 35:46.365
a pretty big hole in that wall.

35:46.365 --> 35:48.210
- Come on then, show me.

35:48.210 --> 35:51.808
Show me what we're whinging,
what we're whinging about.

35:51.808 --> 35:52.676
- Oh no.

35:52.676 --> 35:53.545
- Is that what you're worried about

35:53.545 --> 35:54.790
is a plastic bunch of grapes.

35:54.790 --> 35:57.553
- To hide this where
somebody hit it with a table.

35:57.553 --> 35:58.721
- We can get your grapes back

35:58.721 --> 35:59.927
and you can stick plastic
grapes back on the wall.

35:59.927 --> 36:01.755
Let me show you something for two seconds.

36:01.755 --> 36:03.458
I wanna show you something
really important.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.791
Just have a look at that out
there. How beautiful is that.

36:06.791 --> 36:07.660
- I know, it's gorgeous.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.805
- It's exactly what we just need and want.

36:09.805 --> 36:11.682
- Yes.
- Let me show you something.

36:13.777 --> 36:14.855
- Oh, there it is.

36:14.855 --> 36:16.186
- I look at that amazing stuff there

36:16.186 --> 36:19.001
and then look at this pile of shit in here

36:19.001 --> 36:21.076
and you're starting to create a fuss,

36:21.076 --> 36:23.840
forgetting that this
hotel is about the guests

36:23.840 --> 36:26.008
and you start putting the teeth on edge

36:26.008 --> 36:27.666
because you want plastic grapes.

36:27.666 --> 36:29.783
Here's what I'm gonna do for you.

36:29.783 --> 36:32.723
In 15 minutes I will
clear all that furniture,

36:32.723 --> 36:35.163
okay and I'll put it back in my van

36:35.163 --> 36:37.638
and this shit here I'll put back in there.

36:38.921 --> 36:41.548
(tense music)

36:41.548 --> 36:43.477
- [Gordon] Let me show you something.

36:45.424 --> 36:46.292
- [Cali] Oh, there it is.

36:46.292 --> 36:48.163
- I look at that amazing stuff there

36:48.163 --> 36:50.679
and I look at this pile of shit in here

36:50.679 --> 36:52.107
and you're starting to create a fuss.

36:52.107 --> 36:54.203
Here's what I'm gonna do for you.

36:54.203 --> 36:57.175
In 15 minutes I will
clear all that furniture,

36:57.175 --> 36:59.615
okay and I'll put it back in my van

36:59.615 --> 37:02.337
and this shit here I'll put back in there.

37:02.337 --> 37:04.944
(tense music)

37:06.382 --> 37:08.204
- I am, I am extremely-

37:08.204 --> 37:10.586
- Shall we get in there
and look for your grapes?

37:10.586 --> 37:12.586
- No. I am more grateful than you think.

37:12.586 --> 37:15.714
- Okay, well then you have a
very bizarre way of showing it.

37:15.714 --> 37:17.682
That's all. Thank you Cali.

37:19.228 --> 37:21.408
- Sometimes what I say
with the best intentions

37:21.408 --> 37:22.826
is taken with the worst

37:22.826 --> 37:26.340
and to be aware of that is very good,

37:26.340 --> 37:28.331
because that just means
that I'm gonna be able to

37:28.331 --> 37:31.720
start thinking the thought
all the way through

37:31.720 --> 37:34.708
before it comes out of my mouth.

37:34.708 --> 37:37.402
(gentle music)

37:38.748 --> 37:39.989
- I'm glad Cali's grateful,

37:39.989 --> 37:41.730
but I am worried as soon as I leave

37:41.730 --> 37:43.054
she'll be back to her old ways.

37:43.054 --> 37:44.775
Plastic grapes won't kill her business,

37:44.775 --> 37:47.267
but if she carries on singing, that might.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.456
You mustn't take this wrong
way, and I hope you don't,

37:49.456 --> 37:53.679
but I grew up with a dad
that was constantly moving

37:54.680 --> 37:57.079
our family in and out
of working men's clubs,

37:57.079 --> 38:01.177
bars and singing every fucking weekend.

38:01.177 --> 38:02.772
Seeing him ruin his life

38:02.772 --> 38:04.764
trying to be someone
he was never gonna be.

38:04.764 --> 38:06.724
(suspenseful music)

38:06.724 --> 38:09.049
The other night, I watched
you move from here to here.

38:09.049 --> 38:13.668
I thought Christ, you shouldn't
be doing this in here.

38:13.668 --> 38:15.764
I think there's a level
of class about you,

38:15.764 --> 38:17.902
the way you hold yourself,
the way you dress,

38:17.902 --> 38:19.914
the way you appear.

38:19.914 --> 38:25.128
I don't want to see you being laughed at.

38:29.966 --> 38:33.358
- I really don't know how
to react to that, obviously.

38:38.296 --> 38:40.918
- Every time you're singing,
you're not running your hotel.

38:40.918 --> 38:42.718
- I totally agree with you.

38:42.718 --> 38:45.662
- Right now.
- It needs to be run.

38:47.921 --> 38:49.844
Okay, that makes sense to me.

38:49.844 --> 38:51.061
- Good.
- Okay.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.388
- I think Cali's ready for a fresh start,

38:56.388 --> 38:59.287
so we've invited lots of
new guests and a local band

38:59.287 --> 39:02.008
for Meson's first ever pool party.

39:02.008 --> 39:04.521
- Hi, table for four or five?

39:04.521 --> 39:05.842
- No, 15.
- 15.

39:07.567 --> 39:10.730
(lively music)

39:10.730 --> 39:11.599
- How are we?
- Hi.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.499
- Are you good? Having fun?

39:13.499 --> 39:15.410
A gorgeous place, right?

39:17.607 --> 39:18.692
Enjoy. Have fun.

39:18.692 --> 39:21.048
The pool party crowd are
loving all the changes.

39:21.048 --> 39:23.259
- The fresh tacos are yummy.
- It's awesome.

39:23.259 --> 39:25.042
- They're loving the food
guys. Yes, keep it going. Yes.

39:25.042 --> 39:27.409
You know my first job when I was 18,

39:27.409 --> 39:29.838
pot wash, starters, running,

39:29.838 --> 39:31.423
but I wasn't running to glamorous pools

39:31.423 --> 39:32.831
like your guys will run to.

39:33.835 --> 39:36.772
And the new guests are
loving the colourful rooms.

39:36.772 --> 39:39.109
- Oh wow.
- It's beautiful.

39:39.109 --> 39:42.362
- This is beautiful.
- Oh, that's comfy.

39:42.362 --> 39:45.969
- [Anne] I think this will work.
People will like this idea.

39:45.969 --> 39:47.127
- That's all I need to have something

39:47.127 --> 39:48.287
like this in Las Cruces, because
there's nothing like this.

39:48.287 --> 39:51.561
- We don't have to leave
town. We're here. Vacation.

39:52.465 --> 39:54.300
- I think Cali's heart
is in the right place,

39:54.300 --> 39:56.959
but she has a lot to learn
about running her hotel.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.232
I'd like to introduce you
to a very special man,

39:59.232 --> 40:01.209
Mr. Jeff Maher.

40:01.209 --> 40:02.106
- Nice to meet you.

40:02.106 --> 40:03.403
- Likewise, how are you then Cali?

40:03.403 --> 40:04.271
- I'm wonderful.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.354
- Now, this man has a
wealth of experience,

40:06.354 --> 40:07.615
spanning nearly three decades

40:07.615 --> 40:09.117
of running some of the most prestigious

40:09.117 --> 40:11.463
and luxurious boutique
hotels in New Mexico.

40:11.463 --> 40:13.131
Jeff's a former Innkeeper of the Year.

40:13.131 --> 40:15.853
He's not just good, he's one of the best.

40:15.853 --> 40:18.418
He knows the business inside out.

40:18.418 --> 40:20.618
- After all, he does something so well

40:20.618 --> 40:22.109
that he's Innkeeper of the Year,

40:22.109 --> 40:26.270
I want my guests to get the
experience that his guests get.

40:26.270 --> 40:27.187
- I'm gonna leave you to it though,

40:27.187 --> 40:28.816
to spend some valuable time.

40:28.816 --> 40:29.684
- Thank you.
- Okay, great.

40:29.684 --> 40:30.759
- We look forward to working with her.

40:30.759 --> 40:32.359
- Thank you.

40:32.359 --> 40:34.705
- So, let's talk.
- Okay.

40:34.705 --> 40:36.697
- Now Cali, clearly she
can't turn back time,

40:36.697 --> 40:39.481
but she can insist on this
place having a bright future,

40:39.481 --> 40:42.692
on one condition, she stays
off that bloody microphone

40:42.692 --> 40:47.270
and makes her guests the stars
and not her bloody singing.

40:47.270 --> 40:50.609
Can she do it? That's the
million dollar question.

40:52.170 --> 40:53.039
Coming up.

40:53.039 --> 40:54.856
I finally put Cali's
singing career on ice.

40:54.856 --> 40:59.030
♪ And maybe if I could ♪

40:59.030 --> 41:02.827
(guest screaming)

41:02.827 --> 41:05.110
- It's the end of a long
week at Meson De Mesilla.

41:05.110 --> 41:07.258
I'm really happy with
the changes at the hotel,

41:07.258 --> 41:09.678
but it could still all fall apart if,

41:09.678 --> 41:11.554
instead of stepping up as general manager,

41:11.554 --> 41:13.827
Cali steps back onto the stage.

41:13.827 --> 41:15.600
It's time for me to say goodbye.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.883
If you have that little urge

41:16.883 --> 41:18.937
that you start getting the tremors

41:18.937 --> 41:22.169
and you feel a need for the mic,

41:22.169 --> 41:24.526
I want you to run into the freezer

41:24.526 --> 41:25.933
and stay there two seconds.

41:27.967 --> 41:30.281
I've put your microphone
in a block of ice.

41:30.281 --> 41:35.495
Now, this will give you two
or three hours to defrost,

41:35.714 --> 41:37.831
which will give you a chance to understand

41:37.831 --> 41:40.375
that the guests are the stars.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.303
- I understand that.

41:41.303 --> 41:42.804
- I want you to seize these changes

41:42.804 --> 41:45.252
and run this stunning boutique hotel.

41:45.252 --> 41:47.427
- I will. Don't worry.
- Thank you.

41:47.427 --> 41:49.293
- I've found out from Gordon

41:49.293 --> 41:52.502
that I don't have a singing
career and that's okay.

41:52.502 --> 41:53.464
This is my career.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.298
♪ If I could turn back time ♪

41:57.298 --> 42:00.083
- I can't get that bloody
song out of my mind.

42:00.083 --> 42:03.575
(horn honking)

42:03.575 --> 42:06.682
Since my visit, bookings at
Meson De Mesilla have surged.

42:06.682 --> 42:09.170
- Welcome to Meson De
Mesilla. Two for dinner?

42:09.170 --> 42:10.092
- Yes.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.573
- [Gordon] The new guests
are enjoying the pool

42:11.573 --> 42:12.834
and the new menus.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.169
- It's delicious.

42:14.169 --> 42:16.129
- It's embarrassing. I didn't
even know this place was here.

42:16.129 --> 42:17.089
- [Gordon] And Cali is learning

42:17.089 --> 42:19.018
how to be a proper general manager.

42:19.018 --> 42:20.279
- I appreciate you coming.
- Thank you.

42:20.279 --> 42:21.635
- You're welcome. Thank you.

42:21.635 --> 42:25.159
I really am very grateful.
The man knows what he's doing.

42:25.159 --> 42:26.619
Thank God for Gordon Ramsay.
