00:48.716 --> 00:50.084

A PERFECT NIGHT.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.685
WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER,
BABE?

00:51.719 --> 00:54.088
- AND HOW ABOUT THE GAME, ANDY?
- HOW ABOUT A KISS?

00:54.122 --> 00:56.190
COME ON. JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF SUGAR?

00:56.224 --> 00:57.391
COME ON, GIVE ME A LITTLE.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.863
- WELCOME BACK.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.598
AND WHILE ANDY COPELAND
TAKES A COLD SHOWER,

01:04.632 --> 01:06.234
WE'LL FLIP ON OVER TO HOUSTON.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.602
[background chatter,
laughter]

01:14.508 --> 01:16.110
- AVERY JORDAN?

01:16.144 --> 01:19.647
HI.
I'M DETECTIVE OLIVIA BENSON.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.215
- HI.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.151
A COLLEAGUE GAVE ME YOUR NUMBER.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.286
UM, THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.387
I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET PHOTOGRAPHED

01:26.420 --> 01:27.655
WALKING INTO THE PRECINCT.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.290
- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND.

01:29.323 --> 01:34.162
SO YOU SAID ON THE PHONE
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.565
- YEAH, BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT I WANT TO--

01:37.598 --> 01:39.433
OR EVEN
IF YOU THINK IT'S WORTH--

01:39.467 --> 01:40.501
- PRESSING CHARGES?

01:40.534 --> 01:42.903
OKAY, ONE STEP AT A TIME.

01:42.936 --> 01:47.141
SO WHY DON'T YOU START
BY TELLING ME WHY YOU CALLED?

01:47.175 --> 01:49.443
- I WAS...

01:49.477 --> 01:53.447
I WAS IN MY HOME
AND SOMEBODY THAT I KNOW...

01:53.481 --> 01:55.416
ATTACKED ME.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.918
- OKAY, SO IT WAS
A SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.720
- YES.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.555
- AND WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

02:01.589 --> 02:03.257
- I SHOULD HAVE CALLED SOONER.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.493
IT WAS--I WAS TRAVELING
FOR WORK.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.228
IT WAS A MONTH AGO.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.863
- DID YOU TELL ANYONE ELSE
ABOUT THIS AT THE TIME?

02:09.897 --> 02:11.199
- NO.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.400
I THINK I WAS--
- NO WAY!

02:12.433 --> 02:14.668
AVERY JORDAN. DUDE,
I TOLD YOU THAT WAS HER.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.570
- FELLAS, IF YOU DON'T MIND.
- TOTALLY GET IT.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.938
JUST ONE QUICK PICTURE,

02:17.971 --> 02:19.540
'CAUSE THE GUYS IN THE OFFICE
ARE NOT GONNA--

02:19.573 --> 02:21.242
- EXCUSE ME, WE NEED A MINUTE,
THANK YOU.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.643
- YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?
WE'RE JUST WRAPPING UP.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.245
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.
- HOLD ON, ARE YOU SURE?

02:24.278 --> 02:25.913
WE--WE JUST STARTED.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.715
- YEAH, MY BOSS IS TEXTING ME.
BUT I'LL CALL YOU.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.817
- OKAY, UH, PLEASE DO.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.353
LET ME GIVE YOU MY CELL PHONE.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.222
CALL ME ANYTIME.
- OKAY.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.623
SO YOU GUYS THINK

02:35.656 --> 02:36.724
THE YANKEES ARE GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE PLAY-OFFS?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.226
- I THINK SO.
- I HOPE SO.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.693
- DUDE, WILL YOU TAKE
A PICTURE OF US?

02:39.727 --> 02:40.828
- YEAH, SURE.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.396
- YEAH, I KNOW.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.298
LATELY, IT'S FIVE MINUTES
ON THE TREADMILL,

02:44.332 --> 02:46.200
AND I'M WIPED.

02:46.234 --> 02:50.204
LET--LET ME CALL YOU BACK.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.212
[keys jangle]

03:29.910 --> 03:32.880
[dramatic instrumentals]

04:16.957 --> 04:17.358
.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.392
- WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND HAVE A SEAT RIGHT THERE.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.595
- I KNOW I SEEM PARANOID.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.797
UM...SORRY.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.600
- NO, WE GET IT:
YOU'RE IN THE PUBLIC EYE.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.701
BUT YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.703
HAVE A SEAT.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.772
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:31.805 --> 04:34.975
- SO HE'S STALKING ME.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.346
HE'S BEEN CALLING ME,
SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO SEE ME.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.880
HE WENT TO MY APARTMENT
WHEN I WASN'T THERE,

04:39.913 --> 04:42.516
AND HE LEFT A NOTE.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.784
- THIS IS THE MAN
WHO ASSAULTED YOU?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.819
- RICK PURCELL, MY CAMERAMAN.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.689
- OKAY, HAVE YOU TOLD
YOUR EMPLOYERS ABOUT THIS?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.624
ANYONE AT HR?
- NO. LOOK...

04:50.658 --> 04:53.361
I CAN'T GO TO HR.
I CAN'T GO TO ANYBODY THERE.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.629
I-I'M A PROFESSIONAL.
I CAN ALWAYS DO MY JOB.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.031
I JUST NEED AN OUT-OF-WORK-HOURS
RESTRAINING ORDER.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.667
- IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.968
IF HE'S STALKING YOU--

05:01.001 --> 05:02.002
- NO, CAN YOU JUST TALK TO HIM

05:02.035 --> 05:03.070
AND TELL HIM TO LEAVE ME ALONE

05:03.103 --> 05:05.339
AND STOP CALLING ME?

05:05.373 --> 05:06.674
- HAVE YOU TOLD HIM THAT?

05:06.707 --> 05:07.808
- I'M TRYING TO BE POLITE.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.577
I STILL HAVE TO WORK WITH HIM.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.811
HE'S A GOOD CAMERAMAN.
- WHOA, WHOA.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.047
SO YOU'VE BEEN POLITE
FOR SIX WEEKS.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.584
AVERY, HE MIGHT BE IMAGINING
A RELATIONSHIP.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.386
- THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.620
- WELL, HE CROSSED A LINE,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.556
AND YOU PRETENDED
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED,

05:22.590 --> 05:24.558
SO, I MEAN,
HE COULD BE TELLING HIMSELF

05:24.592 --> 05:26.560
THAT YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.028
AVERY, IF YOU WANT US
TO HELP YOU,

05:28.061 --> 05:30.731
YOU NEED TO TELL US
EVERY SINGLE THING

05:30.764 --> 05:32.132
THAT HAPPENED.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.668
OKAY, NOW YOU SAID THAT
THIS HAPPENED IN YOUR APARTMENT.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.405
HOW DID HE GET IN?

05:37.438 --> 05:39.840
WE WERE COMING HOME
FROM A ROAD TRIP.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.442
HE DROPPED ME OFF,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.877
AND HE HELPED ME UPSTAIRS
WITH MY BAGS.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.814
- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

05:46.847 --> 05:47.881
- I THANKED HIM.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.150
I SAID THAT I WAS TIRED.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.985
HE HEADED TOWARDS THE DOOR.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.988
I THOUGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT,
SO I WENT TO TAKE A SHOWER.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.790
AND WHEN I CAME
OUT OF THE SHOWER,

05:56.824 --> 05:58.959
HE WAS JUST STANDING THERE.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.630
HE TRIED TO KISS ME.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.566
I SAID THAT I WAS TIRED
AND THAT HE NEEDED TO GO.

06:05.599 --> 06:09.136
BUT HE PUSHED ME ONTO THE BED,
AND HE RAPED ME.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.439
- DID YOU SCREAM?
SAY NO?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.707
- NO. NO, I JUST FROZE.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.409
I--

06:15.443 --> 06:16.910
- OKAY.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.113
AND YOU SAID THAT YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYONE ABOUT THIS?

06:20.147 --> 06:22.750
- NO, SO--THERE'S NO POINT
IN THIS ANYWAY.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.918
- WELL, HOLD ON.
- HEY, WE CAN STILL MAKE A CASE.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.688
HE USE A CONDOM?
- NO.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.957
THAT'S WHY I WENT
TO MY DOCTOR THE NEXT DAY,

06:29.990 --> 06:31.158
AND I GOT TESTED FOR STDs.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.893
- YOUR DOCTOR EXAMINED YOU?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.795
THAT MIGHT BE VERY HELPFUL.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.664
- DO YOU STILL HAVE
THE SHEETS, THE BEDSPREAD?

06:36.697 --> 06:39.900
- YES.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.635
- AVERY JORDAN.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.103
IS SHE THE ONE THAT WEARS
THOSE TIGHT WHITE JEANS

06:43.136 --> 06:44.605
ON THE SIDELINE?

06:44.638 --> 06:46.607
- NO, FIN, THAT'S SOMEONE ELSE.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.808
AND BESIDE THE POINT.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.110
- WELL, THIS IS GONNA
BE HIGH-PROFILE.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.012
I WANNA BE KEPT IN THE LOOP.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.147
ANOTHER BAD-BOY ATHLETE?

06:54.181 --> 06:56.717
GREAT: AN MVP-SAID, SHE-SAID.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.519
- ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T A JOCK.
IT WAS HER CAMERAMAN,

06:58.552 --> 07:01.121
AND IT HAPPENED IN HER CONDO
AFTER FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.856
- SIX WEEKS AGO.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.759
PLEASE TELL ME SHE DISCLOSED
TO SOMEBODY AT THAT TIME.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.994
- NO, BUT SHE DID SEE
HER DOCTOR,

07:07.027 --> 07:08.896
AND WE'RE CHECKING HER BEDDING
FOR DNA.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.132
- EVEN IF DO FIND ANYTHING,
THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE CONSENT.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.502
- LOOK, SHE CAME FORWARD
RELUCTANTLY,

07:14.535 --> 07:15.903
BECAUSE THE GUY STARTED
TO STALK HER.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.004
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING
IN IT FOR HER.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.706
- WELL, LET'S CORROBORATE THAT.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.073
CLONE HER CELL PHONE.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.677
CHECK FOR RECENT TEXTS,
VOICE-MAIL CALLS.

07:23.711 --> 07:24.845
- THE CAMERAMAN.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.946
WHAT'S HIS PEDIGREE?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.948
- RICHARD PURCELL. SINGLE.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.117
BEEN AT SPORTS & EVENTS NETWORK
TEN YEARS.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.519
OTHER THAN SOME SPEEDING
TICKETS, HE'S CLEAN.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.554
EVEN HAS
A LAW DEGREE FROM FORDHAM.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.656
- DID HE EVER PRACTICE?
- NAH, HE NEVER TOOK THE BAR.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.825
- ALL RIGHT, GO AFTER HIM HARD.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.227
BUT THIS IS GONNA BE
AN UPHILL CASE.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.630
ESPECIALLY
IF MR. PURCELL KNOWS THE LAW.

07:42.663 --> 07:46.734
FIN, ROLLINS, KEEP THAT IN MIND
WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.638
- AVERY SAID I RAPED HER?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.039
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR YEARS.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.106
SHE INVITED ME UP.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.242
- SO YOU WERE IN HER APARTMENT?

07:55.275 --> 07:56.644
- I HELPED PUT HER BAGS
IN HER ROOM.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.712
- WHAT, AND THEN
SHE JUST JUMPED INTO BED?

07:58.746 --> 08:00.748
- NO, SHE TOOK A SHOWER FIRST.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.750
- YOU AND HER
EVER BEEN INTIMATE BEFORE?

08:02.783 --> 08:04.718
- WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW THESE WORK THINGS GO.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.654
LONG HOURS, THERE'S ALWAYS
AN UNSPOKEN ATTRACTION.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.857
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY
HOW SHE TELLS IT.

08:09.890 --> 08:13.193
- WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER
SINCE WE HOOKED UP.

08:13.226 --> 08:17.798
TRAVEL TOGETHER,
DINNER WITH THE CREW.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.935
WAIT. SHE'S JUST BRINGING
THIS UP NOW?

08:21.969 --> 08:23.637
OH, I GET IT.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.106
HE MUST HAVE FOUND OUT.
- HE? WHO'S THAT?

08:26.139 --> 08:27.875
- IT'S ABOVE MY PAY GRADE.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.743
I COULD GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE
WITH MY PRODUCERS HERE.

08:29.777 --> 08:33.714
- YEAH, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE
WITH THE NYPD HERE, SO...

08:33.747 --> 08:36.684
- OKAY.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.786
BUT YOU DID NOT GET THIS
FROM ME.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.654
AVERY AND I SLEPT TOGETHER.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.924
BUT SHE'S ALSO HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH ONE OF THE NETWORK ANCHORS.

08:43.957 --> 08:48.829
- YEAH? THIS ANCHOR,
HE GOT A NAME?

08:49.963 --> 08:53.667
- I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.636
- RICK SAID
THAT I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.204
- YEAH, BASICALLY
THAT YOUR LOVER FOUND OUT,

08:57.237 --> 08:59.573
GOT JEALOUS, AND RICK
GOT CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.941
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

09:00.974 --> 09:01.942
- IF YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE,

09:01.975 --> 09:03.276
WE NEED TO KNOW.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.778
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

09:04.812 --> 09:07.681
RICK RAPED ME.
- IT AFFECTS THE CASE, AVERY.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.050
NOW THE LAB FOUND SEMEN
FROM TWO DIFFERENT MEN

09:10.083 --> 09:12.753
ON YOUR BEDSPREAD.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.355
- LOOK, HE HAS A WIFE...
KIDS.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.692
THIS WILL RUIN BOTH OF US.
- RICK'S CLEVER.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.894
HE'S ALREADY USING THE AFFAIR
TO CREATE REASONABLE DOUBT.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.130
- THAT'S NOT ALL HE'S DOING.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.699
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE NOTE?

09:25.733 --> 09:27.167
HE ALSO SENT THIS.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.002
- THE OTHER MAN--
WE NEED HIS NAME.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.673
- YOU'LL RECOGNIZE HIM.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.976
- AVERY SPOKE TO ME.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.210
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.946
- SHE SAID THAT
THAT CREEP PURCELL

09:38.979 --> 09:41.048
HAD FOUND OUT ABOUT US
AND WAS BLACKMAILING HER.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.650
- THAT'S ALL SHE SAID?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.752
DID SHE EVER TALK TO YOU
ABOUT PURCELL BEFORE?

09:44.785 --> 09:45.953
- ABOUT WHAT?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.320
I MEAN, YOU DON'T NOTICE
THE CAMERAMAN

09:47.354 --> 09:49.222
UNLESS HE SCREWS UP.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.658
- SHE WASN'T FRIENDLY WITH HIM?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.626
- SHE WAS GOOD WITH THE CREW,
YOU KNOW.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.194
IT'S PART OF THE JOB.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.797
UH, LISTEN, IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN GET HIM TO STOP

09:56.830 --> 09:58.832
WITHOUT THIS BECOMING PUBLIC?

09:58.866 --> 10:00.868
- HE'S ALREADY COME AFTER HER.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.772
HE'S GONNA COME AFTER YOU TOO.

10:04.805 --> 10:08.041
- I THINK HE ALREADY HAS.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.680
- I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO WATCH,

10:12.713 --> 10:16.183
BUT THERE WAS A CAMERA
IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.885
IT GOES ON FROM HERE.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.387
- STOP IT, PLEASE.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.155
[sighs]

10:22.189 --> 10:23.724
RICK SENT THIS TO JASON?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.859
WHY? WHAT DOES HE WANT?

10:25.893 --> 10:29.963
- WELL, SO FAR, HE HASN'T
ASKED JASON FOR MONEY.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.033
JASON GOT THIS VIDEO
ANONYMOUSLY TWO WEEKS AGO.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.702
- THAT EXPLAINS IT.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.203
JASON CALLED THINGS OFF
ON THE LAST ROAD TRIP.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.072
- OKAY, SO RICK THINKS
HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED:

10:39.106 --> 10:40.674
TO HAVE YOU TO HIMSELF.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.710
- I DON'T WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.744
I JUST WANT
TO DESTROY THIS TAPE.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.078
- IF WE CAN TIE THIS TO PURCELL,

10:45.112 --> 10:46.780
IT'S PROOF HE'S STALKING YOU.
- IF?

10:46.814 --> 10:48.081
HE'S A CAMERAMAN.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.717
WHO ELSE WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

10:49.750 --> 10:52.119
- SO HE DID HAVE ACCESS
TO YOUR HOTEL ROOM?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.887
- YEAH. HE WOULD BRING COFFEES
UPSTAIRS,

10:53.921 --> 10:55.055
HE WOULD PUT MY BAGS
IN THE ROOM.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.725
OH, MY GOD.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.026
HE PROBABLY HAS COPIES.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.393
- IF YOU'LL AGREE
TO PRESS CHARGES,

11:00.427 --> 11:01.394
WE CAN GET A WARRANT
FOR HIS COMPUTER,

11:01.428 --> 11:02.863
HIS HOME, HIS OFFICE.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.397
- THIS VIDEO WAS TAKEN
BEFORE THE RAPE, RIGHT?

11:04.431 --> 11:05.733
- YES. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.100
- IT SPEAKS
TO AN ESCALATING PATTERN

11:07.134 --> 11:08.468
OF OBSESSION AND HARASSMENT.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.237
IF WE CAN TIE HIM
TO THE STALKING,

11:10.270 --> 11:11.939
IT'LL MAKE THE CASE FOR RAPE
THAT MUCH STRONGER.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.406
- IT ALSO MAKES IT
MORE DIFFICULT

11:13.440 --> 11:15.308
FOR THE DEFENSE TO CLAIM
THAT IT WAS CONSENSUAL.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.878
- CONSENSUAL?
I HAD BRUISES.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.113
- THE DEFENSE WILL SAY
YOU LIKED IT ROUGH.

11:20.147 --> 11:23.751
A SINGLE WOMAN ON THE ROAD
WITH MOSTLY MEN.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.485
AND THEY'RE
NOT JUST GONNA ASK ABOUT JASON.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.920
THEY'LL USE ANYTHING THEY CAN.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.822
- IT WAS JUST JASON.
- REALLY.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.823
ARE YOU SURE?

11:29.857 --> 11:30.824
NO MORE SURPRISES?

11:30.858 --> 11:33.426
- AVERY, GUYS LIKE RICK,

11:33.460 --> 11:37.264
THEY DON'T STOP,
UNTIL YOU STOP THEM.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.767
- I GET IT.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.069
NO MORE SURPRISES.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.470
- ALL RIGHT.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.773
I'VE GOT ENOUGH
TO ISSUE A WARRANT.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.043
- MS. JORDAN,
AFTER WE PICK HIM UP,

11:50.077 --> 11:51.779
EVEN THOUGH, IN THEORY,
RAPE SHIELD WILL PROTECT YOU,

11:51.812 --> 11:53.013
THIS IS GONNA HIT THE PRESS.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.014
- NO.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.849
- THE NETWORK HAS A PR TEAM.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.987
TELL THEM TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO SPIN THIS.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.524
- RICK PURCELL.
- WHAT NOW?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.827
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR STALKING AND RAPE.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.995
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.397
AVERY? I SEE HER EVERY DAY.

12:10.430 --> 12:14.501
- WON'T BE SEEING HER
ANYMORE.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.805
- A.D.A. BARBA CHARGED PURCELL
WITH RAPE IN THE FIRST,

12:17.838 --> 12:20.140
AND AGGRAVATED STALKING.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.374
- IS HE OUT?
- NO.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.276
THE JUDGE SET A VERY HIGH BAIL.

12:23.310 --> 12:27.514
HE WILL STAY IN JAIL
UNTIL THE TRIAL.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.449
YOU OKAY?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.852
- YEAH, I'VE JUST BEEN
LIGHTHEADED AND NAUSEOUS LATELY.

12:31.885 --> 12:36.456
I THINK
IT'S PROBABLY THE STRESS.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.292
- OKAY, COULD BE, BUT...

12:39.326 --> 12:41.028
YOU GOT A PREGNANCY TEST,
RIGHT?

12:41.061 --> 12:43.563
- NO, I CAN'T GET PREGNANT.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.466
THAT'S WHY EX AND I
GOT A DIVORCE.

12:46.499 --> 12:52.072
- OKAY, WELL,
SOMETIMES THINGS CHANGE.

12:52.105 --> 12:56.076
UH...WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD SEX WITH JASON?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.078
- HE HAD A VASECTOMY.

13:01.581 --> 13:06.386
- YOU KNOW, THE RAPE WAS...
EIGHT WEEKS AGO.

13:06.419 --> 13:11.892
YOU'RE NOT LATE, ARE YOU?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.094
AVERY.

13:14.127 --> 13:19.299
IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT YOU GOT PREGNANT.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.303
- I CAN'T.

13:23.336 --> 13:27.975
I CAN'T BE PREGNANT
WITH HIS BABY.

13:36.183 --> 13:36.383
.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.284
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- A LITTLE NERVOUS.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.087
I DIDN'T THINK
I'D BE SHOWING THIS MUCH

13:40.120 --> 13:41.288
BY THE TIME WE GOT TO TRIAL.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.090
- DON'T TRY TO HIDE IT.

13:43.123 --> 13:47.360
THEY'LL REALLY LOSE THE JURY
IF THEY COME AFTER YOU.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.465
- MS. JORDAN DID DISCLOSE
TO ME SIX WEEKS AFTER THE RAPE.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.634
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE,

13:54.667 --> 13:57.404
IT CAN TAKE SURVIVORS YEARS
TO COME FORWARD.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.506
AND GIVEN HER COMPLICATIONS,

13:59.539 --> 14:01.308
I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.609
- HOW SO?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.611
- MR. PURCELL WAS A COWORKER.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.280
MS. JORDAN HAS
A VERY HIGH PUBLIC PROFILE,

14:07.314 --> 14:10.150
AND SHE KNEW
THAT BY COMING FORWARD

14:10.183 --> 14:13.053
IT COULD DAMAGE HER REPUTATION
AND THAT OF OTHERS.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.454
- AND YET,
SHE CAME FORWARD ANYWAY.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.489
- YES, AT GREAT COST.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.992
SHE'S HAD
TO STEP DOWN FROM HER JOB,

14:19.026 --> 14:22.162
SHE'S DEALT WITH HORRIBLE
BREACHES OF PRIVACY,

14:22.195 --> 14:25.132
INCLUDING THE PUBLIC'S
KNOWLEDGE THAT...

14:25.165 --> 14:27.300
SHE BECAME PREGNANT BY A RAPE.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.336
- WHY DO YOU THINK SHE'S ENDURED
ALL OF THIS?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.305
- BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT
MR. PURCELL

14:32.339 --> 14:35.008
TO GET AWAY
WITH WHAT HE DID TO HER.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.409
- MOVE TO STRIKE, SPECULATION.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.445
- YOUR HONOR, I'M ASKING
THE DETECTIVE'S OPINION

14:38.478 --> 14:41.181
BASED ON HER 14 YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE WITH SEX CRIMES.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.116
- OVERRULED.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.086
- ARE THERE ANY OTHER REASONS
YOU BELIEVED MS. JORDAN'S STORY

14:46.119 --> 14:47.387
THAT THE SEX WAS NOT CONSENSUAL?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.222
- THE FACT THAT
MR. PURCELL WAS STALKING HER

14:49.256 --> 14:50.390
AND SENDING
THREATENING MESSAGES.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.692
- PURCELL SENT HER VIDEOS
AND PICTURES

14:52.725 --> 14:54.594
HE'D TAKEN OF HER
FROM HIDDEN CAMERAS.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.396
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY CAME FROM HIM?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.431
- WE FOUND COPIES
OF THE SAME IMAGES

14:58.465 --> 15:00.300
ON HIS COMPUTER'S HARD DRIVE.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.435
- THE DEFENSE ISN'T PUTTING UP
MUCH OF A FIGHT.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.503
LET'S GET JASON HOLLIS UP NOW.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.438
- HE'S A RELUCTANT WITNESS.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.707
HE'S JUST GETTING BACK TO WORK
AFTER BEING SUSPENDED.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.243
- HE TOLD US HE BARELY PATCHED
UP HIS MARRIAGE TO THE MODEL.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.644
- NOT MY PROBLEM.
I WANT HIM ON THE STAND.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.314
TOMORROW.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.515
- I'M SORRY.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.384
I CARE ABOUT AVERY,

15:17.417 --> 15:20.020
BUT MY WIFE'S
ALMOST FORGIVEN ME.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.388
I CAN'T TAKE THE STAND.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.691
- I USED TO BE
A BIG FAN OF YOURS.

15:24.724 --> 15:28.328
I ACTUALLY WON A FORTUNE ON YOU
IN GAME SEVEN.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.497
BOTTOM OF THE NINTH, TWO OUTS,

15:30.530 --> 15:34.467
AND YOU HIT THE WALK-OFF
AGAINST MARIANO AND...

15:34.501 --> 15:37.437
YOU CAN'T STEP UP
FOR AVERY RIGHT NOW?

15:37.470 --> 15:40.373
- PLEASE, I JUST WANT THINGS
TO BE THE WAY THEY WERE.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.075
- IT'S TOO LATE, JASON.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.476
AND HERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN COUNT ON:

15:43.510 --> 15:44.577
IF WE DON'T CALL YOU,

15:44.611 --> 15:48.481
THE DEFENSE WILL.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.152
- HOW LONG WERE YOU
AND MS. JORDAN ENGAGED

15:52.185 --> 15:54.387
IN AN EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.289
- ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF,
ON AND OFF.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.191
- MM-HMM.
- I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.028
MY WIFE DESERVES BETTER,
AND SO DOES AVERY.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.395
- WHY DID YOU END
THE RELATIONSHIP?

16:02.429 --> 16:05.332
- I WAS SENT A VIDEO
OF ME AND AVERY TOGETHER,

16:05.365 --> 16:08.135
AND I FOUND OUT LATER,
IT CAME FROM RICK PURCELL.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.369
- DID HE ATTEMPT
TO BLACKMAIL YOU?

16:09.402 --> 16:10.637
- NO.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.272
- SO WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU WERE SENT THE VIDEO?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.207
- OBJECTION.
SPECULATION.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.342
- UH, TAKE IT EASY.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.345
- COUNSELOR,
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.047
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.052
- I'LL REPHRASE.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.388
DID YOU TAKE ANY ACTION
AFTER YOU RECEIVED THE VIDEO?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.789
- YES, I TOLD AVERY

16:29.822 --> 16:31.424
THAT WE NEEDED
TO STOP SEEING EACH OTHER.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.460
- YOU FELT THREATENED?
- I WAS FURIOUS.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.596
HE WAS SPYING ON US
IN AVERY'S HOTEL ROOM.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.465
SICK BASTARD.
- MR. HOLLIS.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.800
- NOT TO MENTION, I FOUND OUT
WHAT ELSE HE'D DONE TO HER.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.503
- SO WHAT ELSE HAD HE DONE?
- YOUR HONOR, MAY I APPROACH?

16:43.536 --> 16:47.240
- ORDINARILY, YOUR COUNSEL WOULD
REQUEST THAT, MR. PURCELL.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.741
- THIS IS AN URGENT MATTER

16:48.775 --> 16:50.343
THAT NEEDS
TO BE IMMEDIATELY DISCUSSED.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.412
- WE'LL TAKE A RECESS.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.282
COUNSELORS, IN CHAMBERS.
NOW.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.684
[murmuring in courtroom]

16:57.717 --> 17:01.088
MR. PURCELL,
THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.655
- YOUR HONOR, REPLACING COUNSEL
AT THIS POINT

17:02.689 --> 17:04.257
PUTS AN UNDUE BURDEN
ON MS. JORDAN.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.359
- I EITHER REPLACE COUNSEL

17:06.393 --> 17:07.560
OR YOU NEED TO CALL A MISTRIAL.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.529
MY LAWYER, DESPITE SHARING
MY GOOD LOOKS,

17:09.562 --> 17:11.164
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DERELICT
IN HIS DUTIES.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.732
- RICK, YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.401
- YOU PERFORMED
A BARELY CREDIBLE CROSS

17:14.434 --> 17:16.336
WITH THE SVU DETECTIVES.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.470
AND YOU'VE CONDUCTED YOURSELF
LIKE A DROOLING FAN

17:17.504 --> 17:18.805
WITH JASON HOLLIS.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.540
- I'M NOT SURE I AGREE.
- NOR DO I.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.409
- YOUR HONOR, THERE'S BEEN
COUNTLESS ISSUES OF FACTS

17:22.442 --> 17:23.743
WHICH HE FAILED TO ADDRESS.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.745
- THE ALLEGED VICTIM
IS EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT

17:25.778 --> 17:27.347
WITH YOUR CHILD.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.515
YOU WANT ME
TO COME OUT GUNS BLAZING?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.283
IT WON'T HELP YOUR CASE.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.352
- I'M ENTITLED TO A DEFENSE,
NOT AN APOLOGY.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.287
- YOUR HONOR,
IF HE WON'T FIGHT FOR ME,

17:34.321 --> 17:36.523
HE NEEDS TO GET OUT OF MY WAY.
- [scoffs]

17:36.556 --> 17:37.357
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:37.390 --> 17:41.428
- PURCELL WANTS
A CHANGE OF COUNSEL.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.797
- THAT SON OF A BITCH
IS JUST TRYING TO DRAG THIS OUT.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.500
- AVERY, THE JUDGE AGREED
TO LET HIM REPRESENT HIMSELF.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.636
- WHAT?
- STARTING TOMORROW.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.405
- LEGALLY, HE HAS THAT RIGHT.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.141
- SO HE CAN QUESTION ME?
ASK ME ANYTHING HE WANTS?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.476
- NOT ANYTHING. AND I WILL
BE THERE MAKING OBJECTIONS.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.877
- NO. FIRST HE RAPES ME,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.479
AND NOW HE GETS TO
INTERROGATE ME...

17:59.512 --> 18:02.749
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.161
HE CAN'T DO THIS, CAN HE?

18:22.835 --> 18:23.236
.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.036
- MR. PURCELL,
ARE YOU READY TO PROCEED

18:25.338 --> 18:27.807
WITH YOUR CROSS-EXAMINATION?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.609
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.644
MR. HOLLIS,

18:31.678 --> 18:32.879
YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOUR AFFAIR
WITH AVERY JORDAN

18:32.912 --> 18:34.247
WAS ON AND OFF.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.216
WHEN IT WAS ON,
DID YOU AND YOUR WIFE

18:36.249 --> 18:37.284
EVER SOCIALIZE WITH AVERY?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.518
- A FEW TIMES.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.653
- AND DID AVERY EVER DO
OR SAY ANYTHING

18:40.687 --> 18:42.422
TO LEAD YOUR WIFE
TO SUSPECT THE AFFAIR?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.324
- NO.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.558
- SO YOU WOULD SAY
THAT AVERY JORDAN IS SKILLED

18:45.592 --> 18:46.659
IN THE ART OF DECEPTION.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.229
- OBJECTION.
- WITHDRAWN.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.432
MR. HOLLIS, YOU'VE HELPED AVERY
PROFESSIONALLY, HAVEN'T YOU?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.267
- THAT'S NOT WHY
SHE'S A SUCCESS.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.935
- HAVE YOU EVER RECOMMENDED HER
FOR CHOICE ASSIGNMENTS

18:55.968 --> 18:57.704
IF IT PUT YOU TWO
ON THE ROAD TOGETHER?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.772
- YES.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.241
- DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

19:01.274 --> 19:02.575
THAT THE ONLY REASON
AVERY IS WITH YOU

19:02.609 --> 19:03.610
IS BECAUSE
YOU HELPED HER CAREER?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.445
- SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.946
- I COULD DO NOTHING
FOR HER EXCEPT LOVE HER.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.415
ISN'T THAT WHY SHE WAS WITH ME?

19:08.448 --> 19:09.516
- OBJECTION.
- SUSTAINED.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.418
- SHE WAS NEVER WITH YOU.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.453
- OH, BUT SHE IS HAVING MY BABY.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.422
SO THE EVIDENCE
SHOWS OTHERWISE.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.657
- OBJECTION.
- MR. PURCELL, THAT'LL DO.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.259
- WITHDRAWN.

19:19.292 --> 19:23.396
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER
FOR THIS WITNESS.

19:23.430 --> 19:28.335
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO RECALL
DETECTIVE BENSON TO THE STAND.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.571
- DETECTIVE,
IN YOUR 14 YEARS WITH SVU,

19:31.604 --> 19:34.774
HAVE YOU ALWAYS FOUND
THE COMPLAINANT TO BE TRUTHFUL?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.409
- NOT ALWAYS, BUT--

19:36.443 --> 19:38.945
- YOU'VE ARRESTED HUNDREDS
OF RAPISTS, CORRECT?

19:38.978 --> 19:40.547
- THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.681
- HAS THAT COLORED
YOUR THINKING?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.416
- OBJECTION.
- OVERRULED.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.618
I'M GOING TO ALLOW MR. PURCELL
A LITTLE LEEWAY HERE

19:45.652 --> 19:49.422
BUT ASK HIM TO MAKE
HIS QUESTIONS MORE SPECIFIC.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.391
- I DO MY JOB.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.626
- HOW MANY INNOCENT MEN
HAVE YOUR BROUGHT TO TRIAL?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.295
- ONLY ONE.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.564
AND...WHEN I FOUND OUT,

19:57.597 --> 19:58.998
I FOUGHT FOR HIS RELEASE.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.268
- BUT ALL THE, WHAT,
HUNDREDS OF OTHERS--

20:01.301 --> 20:02.402
IF YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE GUILTY,
THEY WERE?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.904
MEN, THEY'RE ALL RAPISTS,
RIGHT?

20:04.937 --> 20:07.407
- OBJECTION, ARGUMENTATIVE
AND RIDICULOUS.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.376
- SUSTAINED.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.778
- DO YOU HATE MEN?
- OBJECTION.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.246
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP?

20:13.280 --> 20:16.449
- [laughing] OBJECTION!
- SUSTAINED.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.785
- DETECTIVE...

20:18.818 --> 20:21.288
HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU SEEN
AN ACTUAL RAPE VICTIM

20:21.321 --> 20:24.724
BECOME PREGNANT
AND DECIDE TO KEEP THE BABY?

20:28.295 --> 20:29.896
- IT HAPPENS.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.564
- LIKE CONVICTING INNOCENT MEN
HAPPENS.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.967
- OBJECTION.
- WITHDRAWN.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.337
YOU TESTIFIED THAT AVERY
DID NOT GET A RAPE KIT.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.805
- BUT SHE GOT A MEDICAL EXAM

20:38.838 --> 20:41.474
THAT SHOWED TRAUMA CONSISTENT
WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.576
- DETECTIVE, YES-OR-NO ANSWERS.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.478
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,
IS IT POSSIBLE

20:45.512 --> 20:47.013
THAT THIS KIND OF TRAUMA
CAN OCCUR

20:47.046 --> 20:48.515
AFTER A HONEYMOON

20:48.548 --> 20:50.317
OR A COUPLE'S WEEKEND
IN ATLANTIC CITY?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.484
- OBJECTION.
- MR. PURCELL.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.453
- I'LL REPHRASE.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.988
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS TRAUMA
COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED

20:56.022 --> 20:57.524
BY CONSENSUAL SEX?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.426
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.828
- ARE YOU AWARE THAT THERE'S
BEEN TESTIMONY IN THIS CASE

21:01.861 --> 21:04.597
THAT A SECOND MAN'S DNA HAS BEEN
FOUND ON MS. JORDAN'S BEDSPREAD?

21:04.631 --> 21:06.299
- YES.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.700
- AND THERE'S NO WAY
TO DIFFERENTIATE SAMPLES

21:07.734 --> 21:11.804
FROM A CONSENSUAL ENCOUNTER
AND A RAPE, IS THERE?

21:11.838 --> 21:14.607
- NO.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.809
- THANK YOU.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.546
I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.950
- AFTER HE WAS FINISHED,
HE ASKED ME IF HE COULD STAY.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.385
- AND HOW DID YOU RESPOND?

21:25.418 --> 21:27.086
- I WAS CRYING.
I WAS TERRIFIED.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.856
HE SAID, "YOU'RE CRYING NOW.
"ONE DAY YOU'LL REALIZE

21:29.889 --> 21:31.824
THAT THIS IS THE BEST SEX
YOU EVER HAD."

21:31.858 --> 21:33.393
- THANK YOU, MS. JORDAN.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.429
UH, THE PHOTOS
THAT THE JURY HAS ALREADY SEEN

21:36.463 --> 21:38.398
WERE SENT TO YOU
AFTER THE RAPE?

21:38.431 --> 21:39.832
- HE SLID THE PHOTOS
UNDERNEATH MY DOOR

21:39.866 --> 21:41.100
WITH A MENACING NOTE,

21:41.133 --> 21:45.438
AND I REALIZED
THAT HE WAS STALKING ME.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.940
THAT'S WHEN I WENT TO SVU.
- WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.443
BUT THIS NEXT QUESTION
IS DEEPLY PERSONAL.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.412
CAN YOU TELL THE JURY
WHY YOU DECIDED

21:52.445 --> 21:57.584
TO KEEP A BABY
WHO WAS CONCEIVED IN RAPE?

21:57.617 --> 21:59.386
- I HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN TOLD

21:59.419 --> 22:02.889
THAT I COULD NEVER HAVE
A CHILD OF MY OWN.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.591
WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT
THAT I WAS PREGNANT,

22:04.624 --> 22:08.395
I FELT LIKE
HE WAS STILL VIOLATING ME.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.662
- OBJECTION.
- OVERRULED.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.899
IT'S RELEVANT.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.001
- BUT HE'S MY BABY.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.503
EVERY TIME THAT I FEEL HIM KICK,

22:16.536 --> 22:18.438
I KNOW THAT...

22:18.471 --> 22:20.573
HE'S A FIGHTER, LIKE ME.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.709
THAT HE'S A SURVIVOR.

22:22.742 --> 22:26.379
- THANK YOU, MS. JORDAN.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.854
- YOUR HONOR,
COULD WE TAKE A BREAK?

22:34.887 --> 22:35.988
I FEEL A LITTLE--

22:36.022 --> 22:38.491
- DO YOU WANT A SHORT RECESS?

22:40.192 --> 22:45.097
- ACTUALLY, YOUR HONOR,
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY FOR AVERY.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.499
IF IT PLEASE THE COURT,
I REQUEST PERMISSION

22:46.533 --> 22:49.101
TO RECALL THIS WITNESS
AT A LATER TIME.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.737
PERHAPS AFTER I CALL MY EXPERT.

22:50.770 --> 22:54.073
- AGAIN, YOUR HONOR,
I'D REQUEST A FRYE HEARING

22:54.106 --> 22:56.142
TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY
OF THIS EXPERT.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.844
- AS I ALREADY RULED
IN CHAMBERS,

22:57.877 --> 22:59.078
WE'RE ALLOWING IT.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.914
AND MR. PURCELL...

23:01.948 --> 23:03.149
I'VE GIVEN YOU LATITUDE ALREADY.

23:03.182 --> 23:06.786
DON'T ABUSE IT.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.156
- 'SCUSE ME.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.658
- SO, WAIT, YOU THINK
MAYBE THIS MEANS

23:11.691 --> 23:13.092
HE WON'T CALL ME
TO THE STAND?

23:13.125 --> 23:14.661
- OH, NO, HE WILL.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.128
HE JUST WANTS YOU
TO LOSE SLEEP WONDERING WHEN.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.430
- YOU DID GREAT UP THERE.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.465
THE MORE THEY GET TO KNOW HIM,

23:18.498 --> 23:19.499
THE LESS THE JURY LIKES HIM.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.600
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.469
- DETECTIVES!

23:22.502 --> 23:24.136
- HEY, COUNSELOR.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.205
WHAT'S UP?
- YOU MEAN "WHO'S UP?"

23:26.238 --> 23:27.440
CONGRESSMAN FRITZ SHOWALTER.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.742
HE'S PURCELL'S SO-CALLED EXPERT.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.611
- SHOWALTER'S
THE ONE THAT TRIED

23:31.644 --> 23:33.446
TO CRIMINALIZE ABORTION
AFTER RAPE,

23:33.480 --> 23:35.682
'CAUSE IT'S TAMPERING
WITH EVIDENCE.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.149
- CLOWN'S A CRACKPOT.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.551
- HE'S ALSO
A PRACTICING OBSTETRICIAN,

23:38.585 --> 23:39.819
AND HE'S HAD
A FEW ARTICLES PUBLISHED

23:39.852 --> 23:41.554
IN SOME FRINGE MEDICAL JOURNALS.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.155
- WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
- GET ME SOMETHING.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.959
BY TOMORROW.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.163
- CONGRESSMAN.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.732
OR SHOULD I CALL YOU DOCTOR?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.100
- EITHER.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.102
I HAVE BEEN A DOCTOR
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.570
AND YOU PUBLISHED

23:57.604 --> 23:58.771
IN THE
JOURNAL OF CLINICAL OBSTETRICS.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.607
YOU PAID FOR THIS TRIP YOURSELF.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.141
CAN YOU TELL THE JURY WHY?

24:02.174 --> 24:05.478
- THIS CASE RAISES ISSUES
I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT:

24:05.512 --> 24:09.582
LEGITIMATE RAPE AND WOMEN
WHO MAKE FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.050
- CAN YOU ELABORATE?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.152
- MANY OF MY MEDICAL COLLEAGUES
WON'T ADMIT IT,

24:13.185 --> 24:16.188
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE,
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

24:16.222 --> 24:19.492
FOR A VICTIM OF LEGITIMATE RAPE
TO BECOME PREGNANT.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.227
- OBJECTION.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.029
AGAIN, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT
OF A FRYE HEARING--

24:23.062 --> 24:24.664
- YOUR OBJECTION HAS BEEN NOTED,
MR. BARBA.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.198
AND THE JURY WILL NOTE
THAT THIS WITNESS

24:26.232 --> 24:29.135
IS OFFERING AN OPINION BASED
ON HIS MEDICAL EXPERIENCE.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.071
- AND WHY, DOCTOR,
IN YOUR OPINION,

24:32.104 --> 24:34.073
IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A VICTIM
OF AN ACTUAL RAPE

24:34.106 --> 24:35.908
TO GET PREGNANT?

24:35.942 --> 24:38.811
- THE BODY HAS A MECHANISM
FOR SHUTTING DOWN OVULATION

24:38.845 --> 24:40.647
IN RESPONSE TO STRESS.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.181
- AND IF A PREGNANT WOMAN
CAME TO YOUR OFFICE

24:42.214 --> 24:43.182
CLAIMING
THAT SHE HAD BEEN RAPED,

24:43.215 --> 24:44.617
YOUR RESPONSE WOULD BE?

24:44.651 --> 24:45.985
- I WOULD TELL HER,

24:46.018 --> 24:48.287
"HONEY, IF YOU NEED
TO LIE TO YOURSELF

24:48.320 --> 24:49.989
"OR YOUR FAMILY, OKAY.

24:50.022 --> 24:53.259
"BUT...DON'T LIE
TO DOC SHOWALTER.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.927
OR THE LORD."

24:54.961 --> 24:58.965
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.607
- CONGRESSMAN...
WHEN DID YOU LAST PUBLISH

25:07.640 --> 25:10.643
IN THE
JOURNAL OF CLINICAL OBSTETRICS?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.279
- I DON'T ACTUALLY RECALL.
- LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

25:13.312 --> 25:16.282
1974. DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?
- ABOUT RIGHT.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.917
- ARE YOU AWARE THAT,
SINCE THEN,

25:17.950 --> 25:20.119
THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS

25:20.152 --> 25:22.321
THAT WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN RAPED
ARE JUST AS LIKELY

25:22.354 --> 25:24.591
TO GET PREGNANT AS WOMEN
WHO HAVE CONSENSUAL SEX?

25:24.624 --> 25:26.959
- FEMALE ANATOMY HASN'T CHANGED,
MR. BARBA.

25:26.993 --> 25:30.763
MANY STUDIES SHOW IT'S HARDER
TO CONCEIVE UNDER STRESS.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.164
- BUT THOSE STUDIES REFER
TO LONG-TERM STRESS,

25:32.198 --> 25:34.867
NOT RAPE, CORRECT?
- WELL, YES.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.703
- CONGRESSMAN,
DURING YOUR TESTIMONY

25:36.736 --> 25:39.205
YOU REFERRED
TO "LEGITIMATE RAPE."

25:39.238 --> 25:43.743
DOES THIS TERM APPEAR IN ANY
RECOGNIZED MEDICAL TEXTBOOK?

25:43.776 --> 25:48.047
- I S-SPEAK FROM MY EXPERIENCE
AS A DOCTOR.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.817
- BUT YOU HAVEN'T PRACTICED
IN 12 YEARS.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.653
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR BEING CENSURED

25:53.686 --> 25:56.088
FOR INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
BY YOUR CLINIC IN KENTUCKY?

25:56.122 --> 25:59.025
- OBJECTION.
- SIT DOWN, MR. PURCELL.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.893
DR. SHOWALTER,
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.695
- I'M NOT AT LIBERTY
TO DISCUSS THAT.

26:02.729 --> 26:06.866
- BECAUSE YOU SIGNED A MUTUALLY
BINDING NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT?

26:10.269 --> 26:12.071
THANK YOU.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.272
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

26:13.305 --> 26:16.208
[folder slaps desk]

26:16.242 --> 26:18.678
- YOUR HONOR, I'D LIKE
TO RECALL AVERY JORDAN.

26:18.711 --> 26:21.347
I'M READY TO CROSS-EXAMINE HER.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.249
HOW ARE YOU, AVERY?

26:23.282 --> 26:25.151
I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING
UP TO THIS.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.019
- OBJECTION. YOUR HONOR...

26:27.053 --> 26:28.655
PLEASE INSTRUCT MR. PURCELL

26:28.688 --> 26:31.190
TO REFRAIN FROM CALLING
THE WITNESS BY HER FIRST NAME.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.660
- SUSTAINED.
UNDERSTOOD, MR. PURCELL?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.227
- FORGIVE ME, YOUR HONOR.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.164
[clears throat]

26:38.197 --> 26:41.100
AVERY--I MEAN "MS. JORDAN."

26:41.133 --> 26:42.635
I'M SORRY, IT'S HARD,

26:42.669 --> 26:44.236
BECAUSE WE KNOW EACH OTHER,
RIGHT?

26:44.270 --> 26:45.371
- YES.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.239
- WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
FOR FIVE YEARS.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.741
WE'VE TRAVELED TOGETHER,

26:48.775 --> 26:50.309
WE'VE STAYED
IN ADJOINING HOTEL ROOMS.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.279
IS THAT CORRECT?
- WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.014
- YOUR HONOR, WOULD YOU PLEASE
DIRECT THE WITNESS

26:55.047 --> 26:56.315
TO ANSWER YES OR NO?

26:56.348 --> 26:57.784
- MS. JORDAN.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.219
- YES, WE STAYED
IN ADJOINING ROOMS.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.054
- AND WE'VE HAD MANY
A LATE-NIGHT CONVERSATION,

27:02.088 --> 27:03.355
DISCUSSED MANY THINGS?

27:03.389 --> 27:04.957
- I WOULD SAY "SOME,"
NOT "MANY."

27:04.991 --> 27:06.192
- AND YOU'VE SPOKEN
TO ME FRANKLY

27:06.225 --> 27:07.794
ABOUT THE INTIMATE DETAILS
OF YOUR LIFE,

27:07.827 --> 27:09.295
LIKE YOUR DESIRE
TO HAVE A BABY?

27:09.328 --> 27:12.231
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.666
THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING
AMOUNTS TO HARASSMENT.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.301
- OVERRULED.

27:15.334 --> 27:18.237
HE CAN ASK ABOUT CONVERSATIONS
HE WAS A PART OF.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.939
- SO YOU DO RECALL TELLING ME

27:19.972 --> 27:21.173
THE MAIN REASON
YOUR MARRIAGE BROKE UP

27:21.207 --> 27:22.942
WAS YOUR INABILITY TO CONCEIVE?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.276
- I MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT
AT ONE POINT.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.378
- ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION,

27:26.412 --> 27:29.281
YOU INVITED ME
INTO YOUR APARTMENT, DIDN'T YOU?

27:29.315 --> 27:31.017
- YOU OFFERED
TO HELP BRING UP MY--

27:31.050 --> 27:34.821
- YOU ASKED ME TO COME UP,
DID YOU NOT?

27:34.854 --> 27:36.155
- YES.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.924
- YOU TOOK OFF YOUR CLOTHES
WHILE I WAS STILL

27:37.957 --> 27:39.325
IN THE APARTMENT,
DIDN'T YOU?

27:39.358 --> 27:40.159
- I THOUGHT
YOU HAD LET YOURSELF OUT.

27:40.192 --> 27:43.162
I SAW THE DOOR CLOSE.

27:43.195 --> 27:47.734
- AND WHERE WERE YOU AFTER
I LEFT?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.235
- I WENT TO TAKE A SHOWER.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.804
- [softly]
YEAH.

27:51.838 --> 27:55.875
A SHOWER.

27:55.908 --> 28:01.748
RIGHT.

28:01.781 --> 28:04.183
YOU INVITED ME
INTO THAT SHOWER, DIDN'T YOU?

28:04.216 --> 28:05.451
- NO.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.086
- AND THEN YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO USE A CONDOM

28:07.119 --> 28:08.154
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO TRY ONE MORE TIME

28:08.187 --> 28:09.388
TO GET PREGNANT.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.357
YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED
TO FEEL ME INSIDE YOU.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.192
- OBJECTION. HEARSAY.
- SUSTAINED.

28:13.225 --> 28:17.163
MR. PURCELL.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.399
- WITHDRAWN.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.142
MS. JORDAN,

28:30.176 --> 28:32.178
AFTER THE ALLEGED ASSAULT,

28:32.211 --> 28:33.780
YOU DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE,

28:33.813 --> 28:35.381
YOU DIDN'T REPORT ME
TO HUMAN RESOURCES.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.884
WHY NOT?

28:37.917 --> 28:39.185
- I WAS AFRAID.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.087
- YOU WERE AFRAID

28:41.120 --> 28:42.254
IF THE BOSSES FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOUR AFFAIRS

28:42.288 --> 28:43.355
THAT YOU WOULD BE FIRED.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.924
- OBJECTION.
CALLS FOR CONJECTURE.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.826
- SUSTAINED. MR. PURCELL,
MOVE ON.

28:46.859 --> 28:49.261
MS. JORDAN...

28:49.295 --> 28:51.163
DON'T YOU THINK
IF SOMEBODY WAS RAPED

28:51.197 --> 28:53.365
THEY WOULD HATE THEIR ASSAILANT?
- I DO.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.067
I HATE YOU.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.136
- YOUR HONOR--
- MR. PURCELL, PLEASE STEP BACK.

28:57.169 --> 29:00.406
- YOU SIT THERE BEFORE ME
CARRYING OUR CHILD.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.308
- HE'S MINE, NOT YOURS!

29:02.341 --> 29:04.176
- YOU HAD A DNA TEST.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.078
CAN YOU TELL THE JURY
WHO THAT BABY'S FATHER IS?

29:06.112 --> 29:07.246
- YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER,
YOU'RE THE RAPIST!

29:07.279 --> 29:09.281
- THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER.

29:09.315 --> 29:13.252
DID THOSE TESTS PROVE
THAT I'M THE BABY'S FATHER?

29:13.285 --> 29:15.354
- MS. JORDAN.
- YES.

29:15.387 --> 29:19.391
BIOLOGICAL, YES.

29:21.427 --> 29:25.898
- SO YOU ALWAYS WANTED A CHILD,
DIDN'T YOU?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.199
- YES.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.368
- AND I GAVE YOU THE CHILD
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

29:29.401 --> 29:32.238
- OBJECTION.
- STEP BACK, MR. PURCELL.

29:40.980 --> 29:44.183
- I GOT NOTHING FURTHER.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.556
- THEY'VE BEEN IN THERE
FOR TWO DAYS.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.958
WHY IS THE JURY TAKING SO LONG?

29:51.991 --> 29:53.325
- THAT'S WHAT JURIES DO.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.961
- THEY ASKED TO HEAR

29:54.994 --> 29:56.295
THAT CONGRESSMAN'S
TESTIMONY READ BACK.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.230
WHY?
- IT COULD BE GOOD NEWS.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.232
- AFTER OUR COUNSELOR HERE
WAS DONE WITH HIM,

30:00.266 --> 30:03.269
HE WAS COMPLETELY DISCREDITED.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.371
[knock at door]

30:05.404 --> 30:07.339
- THEY'RE BACK.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.958
- THIS IS YOUR VERDICT?

30:25.992 --> 30:27.126
ON THE CHARGE OF RAPE,

30:27.159 --> 30:28.594
FIRST DEGREE,

30:28.627 --> 30:31.330
HOW DO YOU FIND?

30:31.363 --> 30:34.466
- NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.601
- ON THE CHARGE OF STALKING?

30:35.634 --> 30:37.169
- GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

30:37.203 --> 30:41.173
- THE DEFENDANT IS RELEASED,
PENDING SENTENCING.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.841
[gavel bangs]

30:49.315 --> 30:51.050
- EXCUSE ME.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.451
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT JURY ROOM?

30:52.484 --> 30:55.087
- WE FELT BAD FOR HER.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.189
BUT...

30:57.223 --> 30:59.258
THE CASE HAD A LOT OF HOLES.
- UH-HUH.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.527
- THERE WAS THIS ONE JUROR,

31:01.560 --> 31:03.495
SHE BOUGHT
THE "LEGITIMATE RAPE" ARGUMENT.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.198
SHE WASN'T GONNA GIVE IN
ON THAT.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.201
SO ALL EVERYONE COULD AGREE ON
WAS THE STALKING.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.003
- [laughs]
YOU CUT A DEAL.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.438
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.440
- HE'S NOT GONNA STOP.
- IT'S OKAY, AVERY.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.075
YOU GOTTA TAKE IT EASY,
OKAY?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.176
JUST BREATHE.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.511
- OOH. [exhales]
- THERE YOU GO.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.148
- [inhales]

31:22.181 --> 31:23.282
[whispers]
OH, I FEEL SICK.

31:23.315 --> 31:27.653
[whimpers]

31:27.686 --> 31:29.288
NO.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.489
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

31:30.522 --> 31:35.194
NO, NO, NO.
[liquid spatters]

31:35.227 --> 31:38.197
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, AVERY.
SO YOUR WATER BROKE.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.199
LET'S GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

31:52.178 --> 31:52.311
.

31:52.344 --> 31:52.544
- HEY.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.513
NOW A GOOD TIME?

31:54.546 --> 31:57.183
- [whispering]
DETECTIVE BENSON, COME IN.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.289
THIS IS THEO.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.191
- [whispering]
WOW.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.993
HE'S, UH...

32:07.026 --> 32:08.194
[normal voice]
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.462
- [normal voice]
HE IS, ISN'T HE?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.164
AND HEALTHY.

32:12.198 --> 32:15.001
EVEN AT SIX WEEKS EARLY.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.069
THANK YOU.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.273
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

32:21.307 --> 32:23.109
- EXHAUSTED. BUT HAPPY.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.677
I THINK IT'S LUCKY
THAT HE CAME EARLY.

32:25.711 --> 32:30.282
TOOK MY MIND OFF THE VERDICT.

32:30.316 --> 32:33.052
I THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE I WOULD SEE MY BABY

32:33.085 --> 32:35.354
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.556
BUT I DIDN'T.

32:40.726 --> 32:44.096
THEO'S HIS OWN PERSON.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.765
[knock at door]

32:46.798 --> 32:49.035
- AVERY JORDAN?
- YES.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.269
THE NURSE WAS JUST HERE.
- I KNOW.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.471
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.543
- WHAT IS THAT?

32:57.576 --> 33:00.346
- HE CAN'T DO THIS.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.081
RICK'S SUING FOR CUSTODY?

33:02.114 --> 33:04.316
- LET ME SEE THAT.

33:06.418 --> 33:10.089
- YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
A RAPIST CAN SUE FOR CUSTODY?

33:10.122 --> 33:13.125
- YEAH, HE CAN.
IN 31 STATES.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.760
I'VE SEEN IT USED
IN ACQUAINTANCE RAPE CASES

33:14.793 --> 33:16.762
JUST TO GET THE VICTIM
TO DROP CHARGES.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.364
AND THEY CALL THAT LAW?

33:18.397 --> 33:23.435
IN BOSTON, A CONVICTED RAPIST
SUED FOR CUSTODY RIGHTS

33:23.469 --> 33:26.305
TO A CHILD HE FATHERED
WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.806
- THIS IS NEW YORK.
- YEAH?

33:27.839 --> 33:30.609
WELL, THERE'S NO LAW
ON THE BOOKS AT ALL.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.744
MORE TO THE POINT, PURCELL
WASN'T CONVICTED OF RAPE.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.414
- HE ONLY GOT TIME SERVED
ON THE STALKING.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.116
- STATE SAYS HE'S REHABILITATED.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.650
- MEANWHILE,
SHE'S BEEN DECOMPENSATING.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.619
AND SINCE THE TRIAL STARTED,

33:40.652 --> 33:42.688
SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK,
SHE'S BATTLING DEPRESSION,

33:42.721 --> 33:44.456
SHE'S UNDER PSYCHIATRIC CARE.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.425
- WHICH ONLY SERVES
TO BOLSTER HIS CASE.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.527
- SHE'S STILL GOT A THREE-YEAR
ORDER OF PROTECTION

33:48.560 --> 33:49.828
AGAINST HIM.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.131
WE'LL FOLLOW RICK
UNTIL HE SCREWS UP,

33:52.164 --> 33:53.599
AND THEN WE NAIL HIM.
- WHAT ABOUT AVERY?

33:53.632 --> 33:55.134
- THIS WAS ALWAYS
A LOUSY CRIMINAL CASE.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.203
NOW IT'S A CIVIL ONE.
SHE NEEDS A GOOD LAWYER.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.804
I KNOW WHO TO CALL.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.142
- ACCORDING TO
THE CASEWORKER'S REPORT,

34:03.175 --> 34:04.676
YOU'VE BEEN RAISING
OUR CHILD ALONE.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.078
- YES.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.746
- AND YOU HAVEN'T WORKED
SINCE OCTOBER.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.449
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.783
- YOUR HONOR?

34:11.817 --> 34:15.587
- MS. JORDAN,
JUST ANSWER YES OR NO.

34:15.621 --> 34:16.822
- NO.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.190
- AND SINCE
THE BIRTH OF OUR SON,

34:18.224 --> 34:20.126
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING
A PSYCHIATRIST?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.427
- YES.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.129
- AND DID HE PRESCRIBE
ANTIDEPRESSANTS?

34:23.162 --> 34:25.231
- OBJECTION. BEYOND THE SCOPE.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.265
- I'M AFRAID NOT, MS. CALHOUN.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.434
MS. JORDAN, PLEASE ANSWER.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.769
- I HAVE PRESCRIPTIONS
FOR ANTIDEPRESSANTS

34:30.802 --> 34:32.404
AND ANTIANXIETY DRUGS.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.673
- ARE YOU
ON THOSE DRUGS NOW?

34:34.706 --> 34:37.676
- I'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.211
SO YES.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.612
- SO YOU INTEND
TO RAISE OUR CHILD ON YOUR OWN

34:40.646 --> 34:42.148
WHILE SITTING AT HOME,
UNEMPLOYED,

34:42.181 --> 34:43.649
TAKING PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS?

34:43.682 --> 34:45.584
- DON'T ACT LIKE I'M CRAZY
AND YOU'RE THE SANE ONE!

34:45.617 --> 34:49.121
YOU DID THIS TO ME!

34:49.155 --> 34:51.590
YOU RAPED ME.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.425
YOU DESTROYED MY LIFE.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.694
- YOUR HONOR, I ASK THAT YOU
DISREGARD THAT LAST OUTBURST.

34:55.727 --> 34:56.895
I WAS ACQUITTED OF RAPE.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.366
- JUST PROCEED.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.834
- SO YOU THINK
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF MY SON?

35:02.868 --> 35:04.836
[snickers]
AVERY.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.239
I MEAN, MS. JORDAN.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.507
HAVE YOU LOOKED
IN THE MIRROR LATELY?

35:08.540 --> 35:10.142
SINGLE MOTHERHOOD
DOESN'T AGREE WITH YOU.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.543
YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.878
- OBJECTION.
- WITHDRAWN.

35:12.911 --> 35:13.845
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.914
[folder slaps table]

35:15.947 --> 35:18.450
- MS. JORDAN,
WOULD YOU LIKE A BREAK?

35:18.484 --> 35:21.387
- [softly]
NO.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.690
- HAVE YOU RECENTLY TAKEN
YOUR BABY FOR A CHECKUP?

35:24.723 --> 35:26.392
- YES.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.660
- AND HOW IS HE DOING?

35:28.694 --> 35:31.430
- THEO'S IN PERFECT HEALTH.
HE'S EATING AND SLEEPING WELL.

35:31.463 --> 35:35.601
- SO DESPITE THE TRAUMA
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH,

35:35.634 --> 35:40.372
YOU ARE ABLE TO RAISE
AND CARE FOR YOUR CHILD?

35:40.406 --> 35:41.840
- YES.

35:41.873 --> 35:44.876
HE'S ALL I'VE EVER WANTED.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.915
- WHY DON'T YOU WANT
MR. PURCELL INVOLVED?

35:49.948 --> 35:51.583
- BECAUSE
THE ONLY INTIMATE CONTACT

35:51.617 --> 35:53.919
I'VE EVER HAD WITH THIS MAN

35:53.952 --> 35:57.923
IS WHEN HE VIOLENTLY
FORCED HIMSELF ON ME.

35:57.956 --> 36:01.927
AND I DON'T WANT THAT
AROUND MY SON.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.797
- THANK YOU.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.166
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.239
- YES, I TOOK THOSE PHOTOS.
I WAS UPSET.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.440
SHE'S THE MOTHER OF MY CHILD.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.342
- HOLD ON.
YOU SEEM CONFUSED AGAIN.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.677
THESE PHOTOS ARE FROM
BEFORE YOU RAPED HER.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.379
- I WAS FOUND INNOCENT
OF THAT CHARGE.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.881
- AND FROM BEFORE
SHE WAS PREGNANT, AREN'T THEY?

36:22.914 --> 36:24.616
- YES.

36:24.650 --> 36:28.420
- YOU WERE STALKING HER
FOR OVER A YEAR.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.456
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE BABY.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.291
THIS IS ABOUT YOU BEING OBSESSED
WITH MS. JORDAN.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.925
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.927
I WAS JUST SHOWING HER
HOW MUCH I LOVED HER.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.297
- BY SPYING ON HER,
MENACING HER,

36:38.330 --> 36:39.931
AND TRYING
TO HUMILIATE HER PUBLICLY?

36:39.965 --> 36:43.535
EVER HEARD OF FLOWERS?
- THIS IS ABOUT MY SON.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.371
I WANT TO BE THERE FOR HIM,
AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.638
- REALLY.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.474
SO TELL ME, MR. PURCELL,
WHAT IS IT

36:48.507 --> 36:50.642
IN YOUR HISTORY
OF VIOLENT SEXUAL ASSAULT

36:50.676 --> 36:51.910
AND RELENTLESS INTIMIDATION

36:51.943 --> 36:53.979
THAT QUALIFIES YOU
TO BE A GOOD PARENT?

36:54.012 --> 36:55.681
- YOUR HONOR--

36:55.714 --> 36:56.782
- DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

36:56.815 --> 36:59.351
TO RAISE A CHILD
YOU CONCEIVED BY RAPE?

36:59.385 --> 37:03.822
- THE LAW SUPPORTS ME,
AND IT WASN'T RAPE.

37:03.855 --> 37:07.659
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.833
- THIS HEARING IS TO DETERMINE
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.268
MR. PURCELL,

37:16.302 --> 37:17.969
IN SPITE
OF THE JURY'S VERDICT,

37:18.003 --> 37:21.507
I FIND YOUR ACTIONS
REPREHENSIBLE.

37:21.540 --> 37:25.377
I AM AWARDING AVERY JORDAN
FULL CUSTODY.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.580
HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT MR. PURCELL
IS THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

37:28.614 --> 37:30.982
AND IS WILLING
TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT,

37:31.016 --> 37:33.319
IT IS WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE

37:33.352 --> 37:37.689
THAT THE COURT MUST AWARD
MINIMAL SUPERVISED VISITATION.

37:37.723 --> 37:40.392
TWO HOURS, EVERY SATURDAY.
- [sobbing] NO!

37:40.426 --> 37:44.530
- WITH AN AGREED UPON
THIRD-PARTY FACILITATOR.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.797
THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED.

37:58.076 --> 37:58.477
.

37:58.510 --> 37:58.977
- LOOK...I'M NOT HAPPY

38:00.379 --> 38:01.647
WITH THE RESULT EITHER.
- THEO.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.315
- BUT DON'T PLAY INTO HIS HANDS.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.717
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:05.751 --> 38:08.987
- THAT IT'S SICKENING.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.656
BUT YOU HAVE TO ABIDE
BY THE RULING

38:10.689 --> 38:12.324
UNTIL THE LAW CHANGES.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.925
- WHEN DOES IT END?

38:13.959 --> 38:15.727
DO I HAVE TO LIVE

38:15.761 --> 38:17.629
WITH THE MAN WHO RAPED ME
IN MY LIFE, FOREVER?

38:17.663 --> 38:19.398
- HE'LL BE STRICTLY SUPERVISED.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.567
WE CAN HANDLE IT UNTIL
THE COURT APPOINTS SOMEONE.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.535
WE'LL HAVE EYES ON HIM.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.903
- MR. PURCELL,

38:24.936 --> 38:27.639
STAY AWAY FROM MY CLIENT.

38:31.743 --> 38:35.681
- I'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY,
LITTLE MAN.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.690
SO WHERE IS SHE?

38:44.723 --> 38:45.757
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
WITH MY SON

38:45.791 --> 38:47.426
FOR OUR FAMILY VISIT.

38:47.459 --> 38:50.429
- SUPERVISED CUSTODIAL VISIT,
NOT FAMILY.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.963
AVERY DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

38:51.997 --> 38:55.000
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

38:55.033 --> 38:57.369
I SAID WHERE IS SHE?
- CALM DOWN, MR. PURCELL.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.638
- DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN.
- IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

38:59.671 --> 39:01.006
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT,
THERE'S A PROBLEM!

39:01.039 --> 39:02.874
FIRST DAY OF VISITATION,
AND SHE DOESN'T SHOW?

39:02.908 --> 39:04.643
I'LL CALL THE JUDGE RIGHT NOW.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.378
- YOU KNOW,
INFANTS DON'T ALWAYS COOPERATE.

39:06.412 --> 39:10.649
- FIN, GIVE MR. PURCELL A SEAT
IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.886
YOU'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE, SIR.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.427
[cell phone beeps]

39:21.460 --> 39:22.861
- I HAVE TO LEAVE.

39:22.894 --> 39:25.864
- AVERY, THIS IS NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.733
AS AN OFFICER OF THE LAW,

39:27.766 --> 39:29.735
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT IF YOU LEAVE WITH THEO,

39:29.768 --> 39:31.737
YOU'RE SUBJECT TO ARREST.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.805
- WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

39:33.839 --> 39:35.674
- YOU WAIT FOR PURCELL
TO MAKE A MISTAKE

39:35.707 --> 39:36.842
AND THEN YOU TAKE HIM TO COURT.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.411
- COURT! COURT!

39:39.445 --> 39:40.879
HE HAS BEEN RAPING ME
FOR ALMOST A YEAR,

39:40.912 --> 39:42.113
AND THE COURT WENT ALONG
WITH IT.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.750
YOU ALLOWED IT!
- AVERY, IF YOU RUN,

39:44.783 --> 39:46.885
YOU BECOME THE CRIMINAL.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.620
- YOU DON'T GET IT.
IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT ME.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.088
IT IS ABOUT THEO.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.857
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WHEN HE FINDS OUT

39:51.890 --> 39:53.725
THAT THE COURTS FORCED
THAT MAN INTO OUR LIVES?

39:53.759 --> 39:55.661
- I KNOW THAT THIS IS
HARD TO BELIEVE,

39:55.694 --> 39:58.129
BUT YOU AND THEO
WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

39:58.163 --> 40:02.634
AND I PROMISE YOU,
SOMEDAY...

40:02.668 --> 40:04.035
THEO WILL UNDERSTAND.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.704
- UNDERSTAND?

40:05.737 --> 40:09.074
HE'S GONNA UNDERSTAND
THAT HIS FATHER RAPED ME?

40:09.107 --> 40:11.743
HE'S NEVER GONNA BE OKAY.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.679
ME, HIM, THAT MAN.

40:13.712 --> 40:16.682
WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE OKAY.

40:21.787 --> 40:22.988
[door opens]

40:23.021 --> 40:24.690
- I WANT A DAMN AMBER ALERT.
NOW.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.124
- SHE'S STILL AT THE DOCTOR.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.659
- YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR HOURS. THIS IS CRAP!

40:27.693 --> 40:29.661
- THE BABY HAS A FEVER.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.997
LISTEN,
YOU WANT TO BE A FATHER?

40:32.030 --> 40:33.565
THE FIRST THING
YOU NEED TO LEARN

40:33.599 --> 40:38.203
IS IT'S NOT ALL
ABOUT YOU ANYMORE!

40:41.707 --> 40:45.110
[knock at door]
- HEY.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.879
- WHERE'S AVERY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.180
SHE, UH...

40:49.214 --> 40:50.649
I LEFT WHEN HER LAWYER ARRIVED.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.484
CALHOUN SAID SHE NEEDED TIME
WITH HER CLIENT.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.820
- THAT WAS THREE HOURS AGO.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.656
- THERE WAS A LOT OF TRAFFIC
ON THE WAY BACK.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.925
- FROM THE UPPER EAST SIDE?

41:03.128 --> 41:05.731
OKAY, AND AS I RECALL,

41:05.764 --> 41:07.032
YOU CHECKED IN
WITH YOUR CAPTAIN

41:07.065 --> 41:08.667
BEFORE YOU LEFT MS. JORDAN.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.637
I'LL LET MR. PURCELL KNOW

41:11.670 --> 41:15.140
WE'RE MAKING OUR BEST EFFORTS
TO LOCATE AVERY.

41:17.776 --> 41:22.180
[door opens, shuts]

41:22.213 --> 41:24.583
- SO...

41:24.616 --> 41:28.920
AVERY'S STILL
AT THE PEDIATRICIAN'S?

41:28.954 --> 41:31.289
WHERE?

41:31.322 --> 41:34.960
- SOMEWHERE BEYOND EXTRADITION.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.799
OVER CALHOUN
AND MY...

41:40.832 --> 41:43.168
STERN OBJECTIONS...

41:43.201 --> 41:45.837
SHE GOT OUT.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.740
ON A PRIVATE PLANE.

41:48.774 --> 41:51.843
- DID SHE?

41:51.877 --> 41:53.945
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU ASKED ME

41:53.979 --> 41:55.647
ABOUT MY FATHER,

41:55.681 --> 42:00.752
AND I TOLD YOU
THAT IT WAS A...LONG STORY?

42:00.786 --> 42:02.854
- YEAH.

42:02.888 --> 42:06.792
- IT'S NOT THAT LONG.
