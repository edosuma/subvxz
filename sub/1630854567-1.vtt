45:23.375 --> 45:24.963
I think that guy might
have killed somebody.

45:24.998 --> 45:27.138
- Guy. He still
thinks it's a guy.

45:28.795 --> 45:31.694
- Whoa. Hey, you got
permits for these?

45:31.729 --> 45:34.455
[Doc laughing]

45:35.698 --> 45:38.356
- You gotta get
yourself a weapon, boy.

45:38.390 --> 45:40.013
- What? Why?

45:40.047 --> 45:42.084
- You have no idea what you're
hunting up here, do you?

45:42.118 --> 45:44.327
- No. Can you tell me?

45:45.156 --> 45:46.882
- You wouldn't believe me.

45:46.916 --> 45:48.884
You wanna see New Years?

45:48.918 --> 45:51.369
Go home. Lock yourself in.

45:51.403 --> 45:54.475
Don't light a candle.
Don't sing a carol.

45:54.510 --> 45:58.238
No boxes or toys
or bags or noise.

46:08.904 --> 46:10.768
- What are you hunting?

46:10.802 --> 46:11.907
What's up here?

46:12.700 --> 46:15.255
[trunk slamming]

46:15.289 --> 46:17.464
Hey, wait!
[bottles clinking]

46:17.498 --> 46:19.811
[door slamming]

46:19.846 --> 46:22.676
[fire crackling]

46:22.710 --> 46:25.748
- [Burke] There you go.
- Thank you.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.406
- So here's some of those
wallets I found in the cave.

46:28.440 --> 46:31.892
Gonna do some backtracking,
see if anyone saw anything.

46:33.549 --> 46:35.068
We'll find another witness.

46:36.207 --> 46:37.864
- You believe me?

46:37.898 --> 46:39.175
- I couldn't get a
good look at him,

46:39.210 --> 46:42.109
but I think something's
going on here.

46:46.873 --> 46:48.564
- Your boss thinks I'm whacked.

46:49.668 --> 46:51.498
- You're a little
too hard on him.

46:51.532 --> 46:54.225
He's a small town sheriff,
just the two of us.

46:55.364 --> 46:57.331
We are not equipped
for this level of bad.

46:59.471 --> 47:00.403
He's a good man.

47:01.232 --> 47:03.406
- Wow. You're a forgiving soul.

47:05.063 --> 47:07.238
- I'm Jewish. It's in my blood.

47:08.377 --> 47:10.379
- How's that working out
for you historically?

47:11.518 --> 47:14.038
- Well, you know, we
still have our souls.

47:14.072 --> 47:17.075
Better to forgive evil
than become part of it.

47:17.110 --> 47:19.526
- Yeah. Well, I'm not Jewish.

47:20.630 --> 47:22.218
- Well, there's
hope for you yet.

47:22.253 --> 47:23.633
You already forgave me.

47:25.566 --> 47:27.085
- I did?

47:27.120 --> 47:29.122
Good for me. Do I know what for?

47:30.019 --> 47:31.400
- You forgave me for passing off

47:31.434 --> 47:33.851
store-bought matzo
ball soup as homemade.

47:33.885 --> 47:34.990
[both laughing]

47:35.024 --> 47:37.302
- You didn't? You schmuck.

47:37.337 --> 47:38.821
I'm sorry. Can I say that?

47:38.856 --> 47:40.064
- I'll forgive you.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.136
- Why'd you do that?

47:46.035 --> 47:48.451
- Because I wanted
to impress you.

47:48.486 --> 47:49.418
- Yeah?

47:50.522 --> 47:51.454
- Yeah.

47:52.697 --> 47:54.285
- Well, I am impressed.

47:56.632 --> 47:57.564
- Yeah?

47:58.565 --> 47:59.497
- Yeah.

[bones cracking]

49:11.258 --> 49:14.399
[Cindy screaming]

49:14.434 --> 49:16.712
- [Narrator] Nightmares
made it hard to know

49:16.746 --> 49:18.645
what's real and what's fake.

49:18.679 --> 49:22.994
But Cindy found a mission
now that she's fully awake.

49:23.029 --> 49:24.271
- I'm gonna kill it.

49:25.859 --> 49:29.518
[intense Christmas music]

49:37.112 --> 49:40.494
- [Doc] You're gonna have to
learn to hit harder than that.

50:21.087 --> 50:24.055
[Cindy humming]

50:25.125 --> 50:28.197
- Hi.
- Hi, good morning.

50:28.232 --> 50:29.336
Great morning.

50:30.268 --> 50:31.649
- You're in a good mood.

50:31.683 --> 50:33.996
- I am. I really am.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.205
Feels like a fog
has been lifted.

50:37.413 --> 50:40.002
For so long, I've been
lost and confused,

50:40.037 --> 50:44.144
but now, I don't know, all the
doubts and worries are gone.

50:45.007 --> 50:46.112
I feel great.

50:47.216 --> 50:48.597
I know exactly
what I need to do.

50:49.563 --> 50:50.461
Ooh!

50:52.394 --> 50:54.534
I'll take a dozen of those.

50:54.568 --> 50:56.363
Excuse me?
- Yeah.

Oh, shit.

52:55.931 --> 52:57.312
Damn it.

52:57.346 --> 52:59.624
- License and registration, Doc.

53:02.317 --> 53:03.421
- How you doing?

53:04.491 --> 53:05.906
- Better than you.
- Yeah.

53:07.943 --> 53:09.876
[lights turning off]

[footsteps]

53:20.611 --> 53:21.991
- Here you go, buddy.

53:23.130 --> 53:26.755
- Thanks, Charlie. Was
starting to wonder.

53:27.963 --> 53:30.759
[door shutting]

53:34.003 --> 53:36.868
[box opening]

53:36.903 --> 53:38.215
What the hell?

53:42.702 --> 53:47.327
Charlie, it's Don. You
dropped off the wrong package.

53:47.362 --> 53:50.019
I ordered bell peppers, not

53:50.054 --> 53:53.471
[bells jingling]
jingle bells.

53:55.301 --> 53:57.303
You better come and get this.

53:57.337 --> 53:58.304
[bell jingling]

53:58.338 --> 54:00.306
Sorry, we're closed.

54:01.445 --> 54:04.517
I'm just closing up,
but I'll wait for you.

54:05.380 --> 54:06.933
Okay, see you in a bit.

54:09.038 --> 54:11.903

55:48.448 --> 55:49.553
You here?

56:03.601 --> 56:05.292
[dramatic sting]

56:05.327 --> 56:07.364
- [Doc] Come on,
Sheriff, really is this-

56:07.398 --> 56:08.813
- [Hooper] You know the way.

56:08.848 --> 56:13.611
- Ridiculous. I just,
I didn't do nothing.

56:13.646 --> 56:18.064
- Oh, come on, Doc.
Twice the legal limit?

56:18.098 --> 56:20.791
- I'm trying to
help you, Sheriff.

56:20.825 --> 56:23.138
I'm trying to stop a monster.

56:23.172 --> 56:25.036
- Me too, not letting you loose

56:25.071 --> 56:27.901
with a shit ton of
bullets 'til you dry out.

56:29.351 --> 56:32.665
[cell door slamming]

56:35.253 --> 56:40.673
- It's all fallen apart,
Sheriff, you know that.

56:42.606 --> 56:47.542
- Yeah, I know.

56:47.576 --> 56:49.785
- Can I have some
snacks at least?

56:51.925 --> 56:54.583
[eerie music]

57:02.349 --> 57:03.454
- Madam Mayor.

57:04.559 --> 57:06.940
- Sheriff, what
are you doing here?

57:06.975 --> 57:08.148
[trunk slamming]

57:08.183 --> 57:09.184
- Going somewhere?

57:10.875 --> 57:13.464
- Just heading up to Tahoe,
see my sister for the holidays,

57:13.499 --> 57:15.052
that's all.
- Mhm.

57:16.778 --> 57:18.883
- Just through the new year.
- Hmm.

57:21.472 --> 57:23.129
- What do you want, Sheriff?

57:25.131 --> 57:26.960
- I wanna know if
you did anything

57:26.995 --> 57:29.204
that'll bite me in the ass
if someone looks too closely.

57:30.101 --> 57:31.586
- Who's looking?

57:31.620 --> 57:33.208
- Trained eyes.

57:33.242 --> 57:35.762
- Then get them
to look elsewhere.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.178
- Open to suggestions.

57:39.421 --> 57:41.596
- I'm not your
deputy anymore, Pete.

57:41.630 --> 57:43.874
I can't do your job too.

57:43.908 --> 57:46.221
God, nothing has changed.

57:46.255 --> 57:48.119
- Everything has changed.

57:48.154 --> 57:51.502
The hikers, the
diner, Doc, now Cindy.

57:55.644 --> 57:57.853
Truth is bound to
see the light of day.

57:58.613 --> 58:00.718
- Then extend the night.

58:04.964 --> 58:08.830
If I burn, I'm pulling
you into the pyre.

58:16.941 --> 58:20.600
- Maybe it's because his head
isn't screwed on quite right.

58:20.635 --> 58:23.016
Maybe it's because his
shoes are too tight.

58:25.053 --> 58:28.677
Maybe his heart is
two sizes too small.

58:28.712 --> 58:29.816
[knocking on door]

58:29.851 --> 58:31.542
- [Burke] Cindy, it's Burke.

58:32.439 --> 58:33.544
- Come in.

58:33.579 --> 58:35.650
[door squeaking and slamming]

58:35.684 --> 58:37.375
- You are not gonna
believe what I found.

58:37.410 --> 58:40.551
I've started looking through
all those wallets and IDs.

58:43.243 --> 58:44.728
So look at this.

58:44.762 --> 58:46.108
Look at that backpack.

58:47.282 --> 58:49.526
These shoes, those
are hiking boots.

58:50.216 --> 58:51.735
Here, check this out.

58:51.769 --> 58:56.084
Yosemite hiking
pass, this one, so...

58:57.430 --> 58:59.846
They're all hikers.
Every single one of them.

58:59.881 --> 59:01.641
- Okay?
- Okay.

59:01.676 --> 59:04.817
So I went on Facebook
to look at photos,

59:04.851 --> 59:05.990
and look at this.

59:07.026 --> 59:07.958
He's here,

59:09.373 --> 59:10.305
here,

59:11.478 --> 59:12.721
and here.

59:12.756 --> 59:14.102
All these people went missing

59:14.136 --> 59:16.760
between Thanksgiving
and Christmas.

59:16.794 --> 59:18.589
- [Cindy] He hates Christmas.

59:20.004 --> 59:23.180
- These are all the last photos
any of these people posted.

59:23.214 --> 59:26.217
He's likely the last thing
any of them ever saw.

59:26.252 --> 59:27.184
- The Mean One.

59:28.323 --> 59:31.498
- Sure, but why
come here to hike?

59:31.533 --> 59:36.952
So I Googled "hiking in
Newville" and I found this.

59:38.264 --> 59:39.610
This website's telling
people to hike new mountains,

59:40.749 --> 59:42.751
but they're blocking
their IP address,

59:42.786 --> 59:43.959
so I kept digging and digging,

59:43.994 --> 59:45.720
and guess what I found?

59:45.754 --> 59:47.135
[dramatic sting]

59:47.169 --> 59:49.102
This website is run
by Mayor McBean.

59:50.345 --> 59:53.003
She's been luring these
people to their death.

59:53.969 --> 59:55.661
- So let's go say hi.

59:56.765 --> 59:58.422
- I went by her place.
She's in the wind.

59:58.456 --> 01:00:00.631
Car's gone. Place is locked up.

01:00:00.666 --> 01:00:01.908
- So dead end.

01:00:03.047 --> 01:00:04.324
- I put out word
to highway patrol.

01:00:04.359 --> 01:00:05.912
I mean, maybe we'll get lucky.

01:00:06.844 --> 01:00:08.570
- Don't believe in luck.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.262
The mayor's your problem.
The monster's mine.

01:00:11.953 --> 01:00:14.507
- Well, actually, Cindy,

01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:18.442
I really think that something
bigger is going on here.

01:00:18.476 --> 01:00:20.168
What are you doing?

01:00:20.202 --> 01:00:23.067
[dramatic music]

01:00:25.863 --> 01:00:26.968
- Preparing.

01:00:28.072 --> 01:00:31.835
- To invade France?
[Cindy chuckles]

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.875
Wait, you're not going
after that thing, are you?

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.359
- What? No.

01:00:41.223 --> 01:00:43.398
I am not gonna be
a victim anymore.

01:00:43.432 --> 01:00:44.502
- Come on, this is crazy.

01:00:44.537 --> 01:00:46.090
- Don't call me that.

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.644
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:49.197
- Then don't say it.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:51.717
I'm not crazy.

01:00:52.959 --> 01:00:55.341
For 20 years, they
convinced me I was.

01:00:55.375 --> 01:00:56.929
I was some freak.

01:00:56.963 --> 01:00:58.965
Oh, and Frankenstein

For the town filled
with tourists

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.452
carrying cameras and guns

01:26:21.486 --> 01:26:23.419
as folks hiked the mountains

01:26:23.454 --> 01:26:25.732
in search of The Mean One.

01:26:25.766 --> 01:26:29.494
The beast had been slain
and some wrongs became right

01:26:30.806 --> 01:26:34.189
because Christmas
returned almost overnight.

01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:38.676
[Cindy laughing]

01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:40.333
- Not too shabby.
- Oh!

01:26:41.851 --> 01:26:43.612
- I guess you brought
some Christmas cheer

01:26:43.646 --> 01:26:45.441
to this sleepy, little town.

01:26:45.476 --> 01:26:48.375
[upbeat music]

01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:53.277
[Christmas music]

01:26:55.865 --> 01:26:56.797
Ah!

01:27:00.663 --> 01:27:04.115
- Be my guest.
[Cindy laughing]

01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:05.496
Smooth, huh?

01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:08.913
- Hey, a little
festive cheer for you.

01:27:08.947 --> 01:27:13.400
- Yahoo, whatever.
[Cindy and Burke laughing]

01:27:13.435 --> 01:27:15.885
- So, gotta get back to
the station, Sheriff?

01:27:21.684 --> 01:27:24.031
People are really
coming here to hike.

01:27:24.066 --> 01:27:25.447
- People like a good scare.

01:27:25.481 --> 01:27:27.207
- People are weird.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.864
Do they even believe in him?

01:27:28.898 --> 01:27:30.831
- It's Christmas, people
believe in all sorts of stuff.

01:27:30.866 --> 01:27:33.040
But it's good
business for the town.

01:27:34.145 --> 01:27:36.320
Guess we get a brighter
tomorrow after all.

01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:38.529
- Because of a monster.

01:27:38.563 --> 01:27:40.910
- Ah, they'll never find him.

01:27:40.945 --> 01:27:42.498
- Feds took everything?

01:27:42.533 --> 01:27:46.640
- Body, photos, every
last shred of evidence.

01:27:46.675 --> 01:27:48.815
- So people will never
know what happened here.

01:27:48.849 --> 01:27:50.230
- Nope.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:51.576
- Did they tell you anything?

01:27:51.611 --> 01:27:52.750
- Cause of death.

01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.752
Heart exploded.

01:27:56.547 --> 01:27:58.273
- Not a very happy ending.

01:27:58.307 --> 01:28:01.552
- Yeah, but I bet there's a
parallel universe somewhere

01:28:01.586 --> 01:28:03.588
where this story's
a lot more fun.

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:08.386
- Wish we were in that one.

01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:12.390
- High hopes for happily
ever after in this one?

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.533
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:28:18.948 --> 01:28:21.330
Merry Christmas.
- Happy Hanukkah.

01:28:26.611 --> 01:28:28.441
- [Both] Yahoo doray.

01:28:29.165 --> 01:28:32.099
[whimsical music]

01:28:40.798 --> 01:28:44.491
- [Narrator] And so ends
our story with holiday cheer

01:28:44.526 --> 01:28:47.529
and they all lived
happily ever after.

01:28:49.772 --> 01:28:54.121
Well, at least 'til next year.
