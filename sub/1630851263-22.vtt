00:34.034 --> 00:35.339
Man, give me that.

00:35.383 --> 00:37.341
You'll never open it
with them tiny baby hands.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.647
I can open it.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.127
I was just
trying to be careful.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.825
This could be a very
valuable bag of chips.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.044
But they're just chips, yo.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.523
How can they be valuable?

00:46.089 --> 00:47.830
Because of the sweepstakes.

00:47.873 --> 00:50.006
Inside every bag,
is a chance to win,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.660
a kajillion dollars.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.403
- The suspense is
overloading my circuits.

00:56.447 --> 00:57.840
Open the bag! Open the bag!

01:03.063 --> 01:04.063
Did we win?

01:04.194 --> 01:05.239
Hold on.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.936
I think I see
something at the bottom.

01:15.423 --> 01:18.817
Oh, my goodness!
We won!

01:18.861 --> 01:20.297
We are rich!

01:20.341 --> 01:21.820
We're not just rich.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.388
We're filthy, stinking rich!

01:24.432 --> 01:26.303
Yeah, like them
corporate Fat Cats.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.916
Yes. We shall live
like the cats who are the fat.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.007
And no one shall ever,
ever the stop us!

01:35.965 --> 01:36.965
Who is that?

01:41.057 --> 01:43.842
- It's the IRS.
- The I-R-what now?

01:43.886 --> 01:46.323
The IRS. As in
the Internal Revenue Service?

01:46.367 --> 01:47.672
It's the government agency

01:47.716 --> 01:49.370
responsible for collecting taxes.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.069
And the taxes are...

01:53.113 --> 01:54.549
I'm so glad you've asked, Star.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.812
Money we pay to the government
to fund vital services

01:56.855 --> 01:58.857
<i>like road maintenance,
the fire department,</i>

01:58.901 --> 02:02.861
<i>health inspectors, sanitation
and much, much more.</i>

02:02.905 --> 02:05.299
But I don't want no government
agents taking my money.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.736
Yeah, it was hard
opening up that bag of chips

02:07.779 --> 02:08.887
and eating our way
to the bottom.

02:08.911 --> 02:10.173
Relax.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.175
The IRS isn't going to
take all of our money.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.221
They're only
going to take half.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.833
- What...
- ...the heck, Robin?

02:17.876 --> 02:21.010
How greedy can these
government agents get?

02:21.053 --> 02:22.925
Look, even after
we pay our taxes,

02:22.968 --> 02:24.492
the amount of money
we get to keep

02:24.535 --> 02:25.710
is still obscene.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.191
Forget it! I don't want to
pay no taxes.

02:28.235 --> 02:31.020
These IRS agents
are straight up evil, dude.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.370
I say we get the rid of them.

02:33.414 --> 02:37.069
Great idea, Star. <i>
Azarath Metrion Zinthos.</i>

02:39.202 --> 02:41.291
What did
you do, Raven?

02:41.335 --> 02:44.512
I created a world
where the IRS doesn't exist.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.993
But without the IRS,
no one will pay their taxes.

02:48.037 --> 02:50.082
and all of the government
services will disappear.

02:52.868 --> 02:53.956
Fine by me.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.827
We do not
need the services, Robin.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.177
Yeah, we's gonna
spend our money

02:57.220 --> 02:59.657
way smarter than them,
dumb governmentalists would.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.877
Now who's up
for a shopping spree?

03:12.975 --> 03:14.194
Yo, check this one out.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.674
Ooh, it's got solid gold rims.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.023
<i>Elegance!</i>

03:18.067 --> 03:19.329
The jet engine!

03:19.373 --> 03:21.026
<i>Horsepower!</i>

03:21.070 --> 03:23.072
It's even got
a hot tub.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.815
So relaxing.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.251
<i>Water!</i>

03:28.295 --> 03:30.645
But buying a sports car
is a huge waste of money.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.386
It's going to lose
a third of its value

03:32.429 --> 03:33.865
the minute
we drive it off the lot.

03:34.518 --> 03:35.563
Who cares?

03:35.606 --> 03:37.652
We've got suitcases
full of money.

03:37.695 --> 03:40.350
Yeah. And living that Fat Cat
lifestyle, baby.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.657
Now let us enjoy
our new purchase

03:42.700 --> 03:45.834
by making it go the...

03:45.877 --> 03:46.878
Vroom!

03:48.706 --> 03:50.839
Oh, yeah,
this is gonna be sick.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.992
Oh, man, not our beautiful car!

04:17.039 --> 04:19.259
Ugh. I think it's totaled, yo.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.697
Who put the cavities
in the middle of the road?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.829
Those aren't cavities.
There are potholes.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.831
Well, why isn't anyone
fixing them?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.312
Because no one is paying
their taxes anymore.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.184
No taxes equals no money
for road maintenance.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.322
Quick, Titans, we have to
put this fire out immediately!

04:39.366 --> 04:42.325
Relax, dude. All we gotta do
is call the fire department.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.349
<i>We're sorry.
The number you have
reached is not in service.</i>

04:46.373 --> 04:48.723
Huh. Considering
it's funded by tax dollars,

04:48.766 --> 04:50.855
the fire department
no longer exists.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.818
That's okay.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.861
I'm sure the blaze will
eventually burn itself out.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.257
Ooh. All of this excitement

05:01.301 --> 05:03.738
has worked up
quite the appetites.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.348
I know a great
burger place nearby.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.089
- That sounds good.
- Indeed.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.483
Then let's buy a helicopter
and fly there, y'all.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.625
Wow. What a
great use of our money.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.020
We'll take four hamburgers...

05:25.063 --> 05:27.065
And one veggie burger, please.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.984
How much of the cash money
do we owe you?

05:37.554 --> 05:40.252
How can they charge us so much
for the meat patties?

05:40.296 --> 05:42.167
Because there's
no tax funded government

05:42.211 --> 05:43.995
to stop them
from price gouging.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.214
Okay, I'll pay it.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.998
But this better be
one tasty burger.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.351
- Hey!

05:51.394 --> 05:52.874
This is pretty good.

05:52.917 --> 05:53.917
Mm-hmm?

05:54.745 --> 05:56.105
But why does mine
taste so crunchy?

05:58.880 --> 06:00.055
Cockroaches!

06:03.101 --> 06:05.408
Why are there
so many bugs in our foods?

06:05.452 --> 06:06.670
Because no taxes means

06:06.714 --> 06:08.542
the city can't pay
for a health inspector.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.282
Ugh. I need to
rinse my mouth out.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.588
Here you go, mama.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.026
Ew! What's
wrong with the water?

06:15.070 --> 06:18.247
The city's pipes are aging
and fixing them requires...

06:18.290 --> 06:19.727
Tax dollars.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.903
I'm beginning to see
how the lack of the taxes

06:21.946 --> 06:24.471
can deteriorate
our quality of the living.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.038
So you're willing to start
paying your taxes now?

06:27.082 --> 06:29.214
- No, man, are you crazy?

06:29.258 --> 06:32.000
We do not have to worry
about a crumbling society

06:32.043 --> 06:34.829
as long as we have the money.

06:34.872 --> 06:35.873
Speaking of money,

06:35.917 --> 06:37.111
we're down
to our last suitcase.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.833
So we need to make
sure we don't lose it.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.138
Don't worry, mama.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.402
Ain'ts nothing gonna
separate me from this money.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.406
Ow!

06:49.974 --> 06:50.888
No!

06:50.932 --> 06:52.237
Our monies.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.718
What's with all these
wild animals running around?

06:54.762 --> 06:56.198
Without budget-saving
tax dollars,

06:56.241 --> 06:58.243
the zoo must have been
forced to release them.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.332
Quick! Someone call
animal control.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.422
There is no animal control.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.249
Oh, man.
So now we're broke?

07:04.293 --> 07:05.729
I'm afraid so.

07:05.773 --> 07:08.471
Living in
a tax free world is horrible.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.995
Unless you have tons of money
to fix all of your problems.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.477
Then we need to fix this world
by bringing back the IRS.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.870
But I can't bring them back.

07:15.913 --> 07:16.958
They no longer exist.

07:17.001 --> 07:20.004
Then, perhaps,
we should become the IRS

07:20.048 --> 07:22.442
and collect
the tax money ourselves.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.356
Great idea, Star.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.227
Then it's settled.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.751
Teen Tax-Mans, go, collect!

07:29.971 --> 07:31.712
Give us half
of your pay check!

07:47.467 --> 07:48.685
Teen Tax-Mans,

07:48.729 --> 07:50.731
convert tax dollars
into public services!

07:56.954 --> 07:58.565
Hi-yah!

07:59.609 --> 08:00.609
Whoo-hoo!

08:17.061 --> 08:19.020
Good work, Team Tax-mans.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.223
We've made a lot of progress.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.458
But we still need
more tax dollars

08:22.502 --> 08:23.938
to fix the rest of the city.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.005
But where are we
supposed to get that money?

08:28.029 --> 08:29.857
We've collected taxes
from everyone.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.467
Not everyone.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.818
Oh, no. There's one group
that is yet to pay their taxes.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.994
The corporate Fat Cats.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.387
How do we find them, yo?

08:38.430 --> 08:40.824
Well, Fat Cats
love staying on top.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.305
So all we have
to do is look up.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.706
Whoa. Those are
some big Fat Cats.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.664
Now let's go get 'em.

08:57.711 --> 08:58.929
Mr. Fat Cats...

09:02.324 --> 09:04.848
These Fat Cats are really good
at evading taxes.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.372
We got a big one.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.852
But he's so heavy.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.637
We can't shakes
the monies out.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.943
- Argh!

09:12.987 --> 09:14.815
These Cats have learned
to become tax exempt.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.691
Oh, mans. We never
gonna get that money.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.041
If only there was a way
we could outsmart them.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.696
Hmm. I've got it!

09:26.740 --> 09:29.743
We'll use the one thing
no Fat Cat can resist.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.005
A loophole.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.933
Quick! Close the loopholes!

09:47.761 --> 09:49.240
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

09:52.983 --> 09:54.245
Ooh, yeah!

09:56.291 --> 09:57.901
<i>With all
the taxes collected,</i>

09:57.945 --> 09:59.816
<i>we were able to
restore Jump City,</i>

09:59.860 --> 10:01.818
<i>to its former
publicly-funded glory.</i>

10:01.862 --> 10:04.168
I think we all learned
a valuable lesson today

10:04.212 --> 10:06.388
about the importance
of paying our taxes.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.607
Oh.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.826
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.741
Oh, the yes.

10:11.785 --> 10:12.785
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.180
You guys
didn't learn anything, did you?

10:16.224 --> 10:18.052
Uh, nope.
