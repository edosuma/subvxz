WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:09.052
We need to show this
to the head

00:09.096 --> 00:10.010
of my geology department
at Caltech.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.141
<i>Dr. Caroline Clark.</i>

00:11.185 --> 00:13.535
You know who Isiah is,
don't you?

00:13.578 --> 00:14.666
He's my son.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.365
But that means
you're my grandmother.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.497
Izzy thinks Gavin and I
broke up because of her leg.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.282
You have to tell her
the truth.

00:21.325 --> 00:24.024
Things with your dad and I,
they were just broken.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.678
<i>And Levi, he was there for me.</i>

00:26.722 --> 00:28.985
The Lazarus uses
the black rock from the caves

00:29.029 --> 00:30.595
as a fuel source
to power the portal.

00:30.639 --> 00:31.814
<i>The Exiles are
about to send them</i>

00:31.857 --> 00:33.685
<i>another shipment.</i>
- And we hijack it.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.165
That's our way
into the building.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.559
Oh, no.

00:39.735 --> 00:40.562
Come on.

00:40.605 --> 00:41.650
Rebecca!

00:41.693 --> 00:43.695
Rebecca, stay with me.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.393
- She's gone.
- What are we gonna do now?

00:45.436 --> 00:46.742
We're gonna go to the caves,

00:46.785 --> 00:48.744
hijack that shipment,
and deliver it ourselves.

00:50.746 --> 00:53.009
And then we're gonna get
our kids back.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.967
This is a map of the caves.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.492
This is where the shipment
of the black rock leaves from.

00:57.535 --> 01:00.060
<i>Once it does,
we hijack the wagon,</i>

01:00.103 --> 01:01.278
<i>go to the Lazarus building,</i>

01:01.322 --> 01:03.237
get Josh and Riley back.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.847
How many guards
are usually at the caves?

01:04.890 --> 01:06.457
<i>Five to ten
at any given time.</i>

01:06.501 --> 01:09.112
All armed.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.766
Be a lot easier
to build a plan

01:10.809 --> 01:14.161
if we knew the exact topography
and position of the guards.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.466
Wish we had some sat photos.

01:15.510 --> 01:19.209
Okay, well, how about
10,000 B.C. version?

01:19.253 --> 01:21.603
There's a ridgeline
right there.

01:22.125 --> 01:25.085
<i>Should give us a sight line
to the guards, the wagons,</i>

01:25.128 --> 01:26.260
<i>the whole deal.</i>

01:27.391 --> 01:29.828
Say we pull this off.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.656
What's the plan
once we get to the building?

01:33.397 --> 01:34.920
Aldridge said
that this would give us access

01:34.964 --> 01:36.139
to the portal room.

01:36.183 --> 01:39.229
Then we just take a portal
to 1988.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.535
We just have to trust that

01:40.578 --> 01:42.406
the information
she gave us is good.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.586
There's only one way
to find out.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.458
Let's gather everyone
and get going.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.112
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.639
Hey, man, hold up.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.643
We have a lot to talk about.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.473
We will
when the time is right.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.607
Not now.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.007
Hey.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.835
We're about to take off.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.840
I just wanted to say goodbye.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.972
I know that if you were healthy
you would be coming with us.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.975
And-and going to the Fort,
being with Paara--

02:30.019 --> 02:32.152
I think that's
the right decision for you.

02:33.675 --> 02:34.763
It's strange.
Being here, I think

02:34.806 --> 02:37.026
I almost convinced myself
I was fine.

02:37.069 --> 02:40.160
Hey, I'll see you again.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.291
I hope so.

02:42.292 --> 02:45.077
Eve? Hey.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.992
We're ready to go.
- Okay.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.646
I think, uh--

02:48.690 --> 02:50.605
I think we should both talk
to Izzy first.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.260
All right.
I'll be right there.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.175
Okay.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.876
I can only imagine
how complicated things are

03:00.919 --> 03:02.356
now that Gavin's here.

03:04.532 --> 03:08.405
I can see that
you and Levi are... close.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.192
What are you gonna do?

03:12.235 --> 03:15.107
I don't know. I...

03:15.151 --> 03:16.152
I didn't even know
if I was ever

03:16.196 --> 03:18.633
gonna see Gavin again.

03:18.676 --> 03:21.157
It just feels like
all the stuff

03:21.201 --> 03:23.507
I was dealing with at home
has followed me down here.

03:23.551 --> 03:27.163
If I were your therapist,
do you know what I'd say?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.686
No.

03:28.730 --> 03:32.864
Allowing it to fester
will only cause more pain

03:32.908 --> 03:35.084
for everyone.

03:35.127 --> 03:37.521
As hard as it is,

03:37.565 --> 03:39.480
sooner or later, you're gonna
have to make a choice.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.008
I really gotta go.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.444
I know.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.054
Gonna miss you.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.752
Me too.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.651
Iz?

04:20.695 --> 04:22.740
Hey.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.568
Are you okay?

04:24.612 --> 04:27.049
I wanted to say goodbye
to Aldridge.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.224
If it wasn't for her,

04:28.268 --> 04:29.921
we wouldn't be
down here together.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.619
Hey, come here.

04:34.099 --> 04:37.755
Aldridge told me
that my mom is gonna help us.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.280
Apparently, my parents
are both scientists

04:40.323 --> 04:42.369
who created this building.

04:44.066 --> 04:47.939
Your mom is in 1988.
That doesn't make sense.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.811
All I know is that
I've spent my entire life

04:49.854 --> 04:52.596
trying to figure out
where my parents came from,

04:52.640 --> 04:55.338
and now maybe
we can get Josh back

04:55.382 --> 04:58.341
and I can finally
get some answers.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.995
When do we leave
for the caves?

05:01.475 --> 05:03.520
Izzy...

05:03.564 --> 05:06.436
- I'm going with you.
- Iz, I spoke to Paara

05:06.480 --> 05:08.220
and you can wait in the Fort
until we're back.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.265
- Mom?
- You're gonna be

05:09.309 --> 05:10.658
really safe there.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.007
Ty and Paara are gonna take
very good care of you.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.443
- Mom.
- Izzy, we were lucky enough

05:13.487 --> 05:14.836
to escape the caves
the first time.

05:14.879 --> 05:17.142
There's no way.
It's way too dangerous for you.

05:17.186 --> 05:20.015
I've been in danger
since the second I got here.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.932
I'm coming with you.
We are staying together.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.499
End of discussion.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.814
If we allow this,

05:36.858 --> 05:40.688
you have to promise
that you do everything we say.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.517
Everything.
- No exceptions.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.652
Okay.

05:48.696 --> 05:52.177
Let's get everyone together
and head to the caves.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.831
Let's go.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.797
Sometimes you look around,

06:02.840 --> 06:05.452
you take in
this natural landscape--

06:05.495 --> 06:08.063
you really have to marvel
at it all.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.283
What?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.678
You don't have to pretend
you're all right, man.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.811
I know you're upset
about Aldridge.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.769
You know what?
Hey, I won't hold it

06:18.813 --> 06:21.685
against you that you've been
lying to me for days.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.862
But if you want to talk,

06:24.906 --> 06:27.952
I will listen.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.912
I'm okay. Really.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.044
Whatever. Sucking on that's
not gonna make you feel

06:33.088 --> 06:35.830
any better.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.702
I know what
you're going through, so...

06:40.748 --> 06:42.489
Aldridge was giving me
a chance.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.794
A chance at what?

06:43.838 --> 06:45.013
To protect the people
that I care about.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.797
Look, what we're doing
right now,

06:46.841 --> 06:48.582
it is incredibly dangerous, okay?

06:48.625 --> 06:50.714
Most of you weren't supposed
to be here.

06:50.758 --> 06:53.064
I didn't want to put anyone
in harm's way.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.675
And now Aldridge is dead,

06:54.718 --> 06:56.459
and I'm just a big fat failure.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.547
Again.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.419
What do you mean again?

07:01.812 --> 07:03.640
It doesn't matter.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.215
Izzy seemed a little upset
with Levi

07:13.258 --> 07:15.086
after the wolf attack.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.262
Yeah.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.699
Does she know?

07:20.657 --> 07:22.746
Yeah, I told her.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.097
Eve, she has a lot
going on right now.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.316
You shouldn't have done that.
- I know. I just--

07:27.359 --> 07:30.362
I didn't think
I could keep lying to her.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.842
What did she say?

07:31.886 --> 07:33.670
She was upset, obviously.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.585
She loves you and she wants

07:35.629 --> 07:37.457
to know what it means
for our family.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.026
Truth is, I've, uh--

07:42.070 --> 07:45.595
I saw you two grow closer
in my visions.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.511
Look, I know
what I put you through.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.860
Okay?
And I know it's my fault...

07:49.904 --> 07:50.905
- Listen, it's not--
- That things fell apart.

07:50.948 --> 07:51.819
And I wish I could take

07:51.862 --> 07:53.211
everything back,
but I can't.

07:53.255 --> 07:56.650
But I'm not gonna give up
on the two of us, okay?

07:56.693 --> 07:58.608
I love you.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.004
And I know you still love me.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.493
Iz. Iz.
Get behind the tree. Go!

08:26.593 --> 08:28.986
Eve.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.292
Virgil.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.209
How did you get out?

08:34.252 --> 08:36.864
Another prisoner,
he tried to escape.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.779
The guards were distracted.
I--

08:38.822 --> 08:41.390
I took the opportunity and ran.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.652
What are you guys doing
out here?

08:44.567 --> 08:46.351
We're going
back to the caves.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.528
Are you insane, man?

08:48.571 --> 08:49.920
Why would you do that?

08:49.964 --> 08:51.095
Place is crawling
with more guards

08:51.139 --> 08:52.532
than I've ever seen.

08:52.575 --> 08:53.837
Why? What's going on?

08:53.881 --> 08:55.099
They're closing down
the mine,

08:55.143 --> 08:57.232
taking the prisoners
to another location.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.889
Listen to me.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.543
Going back there
is a suicide mission.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.067
You understand?
You understand?

09:06.110 --> 09:08.635
And we're off
to a great start.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.392
You! Move it!

09:29.003 --> 09:32.049
Loading up the wagon, come on.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.923
There's the wagon.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.447
They're loading it
with black rock.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.492
But how we gonna get to it?

09:40.536 --> 09:42.016
Good question.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.321
Come on.
Quick, get in there. Come on.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.019
What's happening down there?

09:45.062 --> 09:46.498
I was telling you before.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.023
The guards are marching them
to a new mine inland.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.112
Supposed to be
like hell on Earth.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.636
Brutal heat
if you survive getting there.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.334
Kind of sounds
like we should help them, too.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.423
That shipment could take off
at any moment.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.121
We can't lose our shot
at getting in that building.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.644
You want to just
let those people die?

10:01.688 --> 10:04.125
- No, of course not.
- You want to help them,

10:04.168 --> 10:06.606
the we're gonna have
to split up.

10:06.649 --> 10:07.868
Okay, let's do it.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.087
Yeah.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.872
Eve, Gavin, Izzy,
you're with me.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.525
We'll take the wagon.

10:13.569 --> 10:16.137
Levi, Scott, Lucas,
you help the prisoners.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.704
Yeah. Piece of cake.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.663
- How can I help?
- By getting to safety.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.013
Get back to our clearing.
It's about ten miles due west.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.841
Come on, hurry up.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.713
Please be safe.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.284
Iz,

10:33.328 --> 10:35.547
I know that mom told you
about her and Levi.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.115
Then why do you sound
so calm about it?

10:40.161 --> 10:41.379
'Cause right now
the only important thing

10:41.423 --> 10:43.120
is getting Josh back.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.296
Okay?

10:47.559 --> 10:50.780
Okay.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.828
I-I can't believe this.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.701
You're my grandson?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.877
You're not the only one
whose mind is blown, lady.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.488
I mean...

11:03.532 --> 11:04.664
Grandma?

11:09.016 --> 11:11.279
I can see Isiah in you.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.284
What's my son like?

11:18.025 --> 11:20.767
He's a brave kid.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.466
He grows up to be
an even braver man.

11:26.424 --> 11:30.428
He made some mistakes,
but-but he learned from them.

11:30.472 --> 11:33.475
I-I've missed so much.

11:33.518 --> 11:37.087
Wait, sorry, but this
doesn't make any sense.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.263
I thought his dad
was from 10,000 B.C.

11:39.307 --> 11:43.659
So what are you doing here
in 1988?

11:46.488 --> 11:49.883
Your father wasn't born
in 10,000 B.C.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.493
He was born in the future.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.191
Time out.
You're from the future?

11:56.237 --> 11:59.109
We went to 10,000 B.C.
as part of an experiment.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.763
We were trying
to save our world,

12:00.807 --> 12:03.113
but we ended up doing
more harm than good.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.767
That's why I came to 1988.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.509
I'm-I'm trying to fix
those mistakes.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.467
Mistakes? Like what?

12:09.511 --> 12:12.514
Like the sink holes
and the tidal wave.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.300
It's a lot to explain,

12:16.344 --> 12:18.563
but our work
caused that to happen.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.653
That's crazy.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.047
But it still doesn't explain
why you came to '88.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.354
The first theoretical
experiments in time travel

12:26.397 --> 12:27.616
started in the '80s.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.879
I needed that data
to complete my work.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.011
Once I'm finished,

12:31.054 --> 12:32.534
I'm gonna take it back
to 10,000 B.C.

12:32.577 --> 12:35.363
and stop these sinkholes
once and for all.

12:35.406 --> 12:38.583
Okay. How can we help?

12:38.627 --> 12:40.020
First, I need to find Isiah.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.152
No, you can't do that.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.675
He's my son.

12:43.719 --> 12:46.417
If you do anything to stop
Isiah from getting adopted

12:46.461 --> 12:49.377
and growing up to become
Gavin Harris,

12:49.420 --> 12:51.596
I'll basically cease to exist.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.819
Okay. I won't.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.823
Franklin said you could
help us put the word out,

13:00.867 --> 13:02.825
get people to believe us
about the tidal wave.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.523
He said it's gonna happen
in the next 72 hours.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.439
I can help.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.832
My data's at my office.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.965
I need to review it
and figure out the next steps.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.793
Meet me there in two hours.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.707
Okay.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.275
Thank you.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.719
Come on, let's go.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.723
- Who's that?
- Quickly.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.770
That's Taamet.
He oversees the operation.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.337
Okay. And those
are the wagon drivers, right?

13:36.380 --> 13:37.381
- Move. Faster.
- Yeah.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.382
Are we gonna take him out

13:38.426 --> 13:39.731
and grab their wagon?

13:39.775 --> 13:42.038
No, no. We can't do that.
We're too exposed.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.300
What do we do then?

13:43.344 --> 13:45.476
We wait
till the guards get going.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.914
We follow them
and then we make our move.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.091
Agreed. Yeah.
Let's get out of here.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.273
There's a spot
about a 1/4 mile west where--

14:08.717 --> 14:10.371
Eve? Iz?
Hey, you all right?

14:10.414 --> 14:11.851
Yeah, yeah.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.374
What was that?

14:13.417 --> 14:15.419
It's a booby trap.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.378
Exiles must have set it up.

14:17.421 --> 14:20.120
I think
we're back in the caves.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.122
We're not the first ones

14:22.165 --> 14:23.427
they've trapped in here.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.389
Oh.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.872
What the hell?

14:35.526 --> 14:37.615
Mom, there's something
on my back.

14:46.668 --> 14:49.453
Oh. Oh, God, get it off me.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.935
I really hate spiders.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.285
- I know you do, honey. I know.
- It's okay. It's gone.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.896
Hey, you're fine.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.550
Oh, my God.
They're everywhere.

15:13.825 --> 15:14.826
Back up. Back up.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.089
Everybody behind me.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.221
Izzy, listen to me.
You have to breathe.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.136
I need you to breathe.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.746
Breathe.

15:21.790 --> 15:22.878
Take a deep breath.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.751
They were mining these caves.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.797
They must have loosened
the walls.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.494
Izzy! Let's go!
- I can't.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.148
- Come on!
- All right, all you gotta do

15:32.192 --> 15:33.845
is get through that hole
in the wall behind you, okay?

15:33.889 --> 15:35.978
You gotta breathe
and you gotta move.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.240
Izzy, come on!

15:37.284 --> 15:39.634
Iz. Izzy!
- Move your feet. Go.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.983
Please...

15:41.027 --> 15:42.550
- Izzy?
- I really can't.

15:42.593 --> 15:43.681
I--

15:43.725 --> 15:46.206
- Go, go, go, go.
- Okay.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.860
Eve.

15:48.904 --> 15:51.385
Eve, let's go.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.735
Sam? Sam, come on.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.345
Let's go.
Sam! Come on.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.221
Go!

16:07.401 --> 16:09.011
Hey. Hey.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.024
Let's take them by surprise.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.939
I don't see
how we do that here.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.158
Too much open terrain.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.202
Okay, so let's keep
tailing them,

16:26.246 --> 16:27.160
see if there's more cover
up ahead.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.335
Even if there is,

16:28.378 --> 16:29.945
they have us outmanned
three to one.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.555
We need more manpower.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.213
Hold on.
They're marching north.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.388
So?

16:38.432 --> 16:40.173
Paara's village
is in that direction.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.914
It's only a couple miles
from here.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.177
You guys keep tailing them.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.353
I'm gonna catch up
as soon as I can, okay?

16:48.964 --> 16:50.574
He really is heroic,
isn't he?

16:52.794 --> 16:54.361
No. No, no, no.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.145
Oh, God, please no.
Not today.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.581
Dude, it's empty.
Get over it.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.801
No, you don't understand.
I need this to function.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.238
Well, I don't see
a dispensary around here, man.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.545
So you better figure it out. Fast.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.201
You're fine.
Everything's fine.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.594
Totally and completely fine.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.035
I have to say,
it is really nice to be here.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.427
I couldn't agree more.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.741
Don't mind them.
They're just curious.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.569
Curious isn't exactly
the word I would use.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.703
They're not used to seeing me
with someone.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.141
Especially not a sky person.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.491
Give them time.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.583
How long's it been

17:42.626 --> 17:44.454
since you and your husband
were together?

17:46.630 --> 17:48.241
Many years.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.724
It's okay.
You can talk to me about him.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.726
I am a professional listener.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.125
He was my first love.

18:04.431 --> 18:05.954
We wanted to start
a family together,

18:05.997 --> 18:07.608
but he passed away.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.480
Oh, Paara, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

18:12.526 --> 18:15.094
Honestly, I prefer
not to speak about it.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.140
It took a long time,

18:18.184 --> 18:20.621
but I've put
that pain behind me.

18:20.664 --> 18:25.495
I'm finally ready
to be happy with you.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.637
Back exit is gonna
be down this tunnel.

18:36.680 --> 18:40.249
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.860
They closed it off.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.254
We're trapped here.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.952
Look, we have to get
to that wagon before it leaves.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.259
Sam...

18:50.303 --> 18:52.218
the guards, they were busy
clearing everything out.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.045
So they'll be distracted.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.135
Maybe we can sneak out.
- Exactly.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.616
Okay, look.
The main gate is right here.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.227
Down this way.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.317
You guys stay here.
I'll take a look.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.970
Stay with your family, Gavin.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.798
Be right back.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.020
If we don't get
to that wagon,

19:12.063 --> 19:13.978
we're never gonna
get Josh back.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.111
I know it's scary right now,

19:16.155 --> 19:17.678
but we're gonna do
everything we can

19:17.721 --> 19:18.809
to get to him.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.333
We've come this far, right?

19:20.376 --> 19:22.422
We're not gonna stop.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.163
Okay?

19:25.642 --> 19:27.166
Yeah.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.657
Is this really how
it's gonna be from now on?

19:40.701 --> 19:44.226
Pretend like
everything's fine...

19:44.270 --> 19:46.228
when clearly it's not?

19:46.272 --> 19:49.231
Iz, this is not the time.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.320
Yeah, it is.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.627
I want us to be a family again.

19:53.670 --> 19:54.976
That's why we're doing
all of this.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.107
Or at least I thought it was.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.240
I know
it's complicated right now.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.895
It doesn't have to be.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.897
You love Dad, right?

20:02.940 --> 20:04.290
Izzy, please.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.335
No, if you love someone,

20:06.379 --> 20:08.598
then you should want
to be with them.

20:10.426 --> 20:14.038
Iz, don't put this
on your mom, okay?

20:14.082 --> 20:16.171
The problems we have are
'cause of things that I did.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.261
The visions weren't
your fault.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.220
Okay? And you're trying
to make up for it.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.269
That has to count
for something.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.184
Doesn't it?

20:32.187 --> 20:34.363
Hey, I think I found
a way out.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.149
Let's go.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.682
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Dr. Clark.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.336
- Not here.
- My friend and I just went

20:50.379 --> 20:51.728
to her office
and she wasn't there.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.077
Well, you won't
find her there.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.427
She's asked me
to cover her lecture

20:54.470 --> 20:56.429
and her office hours.

20:56.472 --> 20:57.821
Do you know
where she went?

20:57.865 --> 20:59.910
She only said
it was a family matter.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.912
Hold on.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.305
I know this will sound odd,

21:03.349 --> 21:04.480
but I think Dr. Clark
might be making

21:04.524 --> 21:06.308
a really big mistake right now.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.310
Please, if you know
anything else,

21:08.354 --> 21:09.877
you have to tell me.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.140
All I know is,
when she asked me to cover,

21:12.183 --> 21:14.795
she was on the phone
with Child Protective Services.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.843
She's gonna adopt Isiah.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.323
Oh, no.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.673
I'll be back.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.461
I'm here about an adoption.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
Just one moment, please.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.728
Child Protective Services,
can I help you?

21:52.746 --> 21:53.703
Aw, come on.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.841
Dude, there's nothing there.
Let it go.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.930
I find it soothing, okay?
Leave me alone.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.851
They're marching
those prisoners to that raft.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.418
- Yeah.
- They're gonna sail them

22:12.461 --> 22:13.549
down the river.
- Yeah.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.550
As soon as that sail
catches any wind,

22:14.594 --> 22:16.335
we won't be able to keep up.

22:19.468 --> 22:22.384
- We got to stop them.
- We should wait for Levi.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.516
There's no time, okay?

22:23.559 --> 22:24.691
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.388
Hold on.
There's gotta be another way.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.520
Get off!

22:27.563 --> 22:29.217
I won't let you die, too, okay?

22:31.698 --> 22:33.482
Look, yes, all right, fine.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.310
I am totally screwed up
about Aldridge dying, okay?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.357
But this goes so much deeper
than you know.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.228
What?

22:42.622 --> 22:45.668
When I was 13,
my older brother died.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.542
What happened?

22:52.414 --> 22:53.850
We were at the beach.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.199
He liked showing off to me.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.680
He wanted me to see
how far out he could swim.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.117
I thought he was so cool.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.511
But then he started
to struggle.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.470
I wasn't a strong swimmer.
I didn't know what to do.

23:04.513 --> 23:05.993
I just--

23:07.211 --> 23:08.648
I just froze.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.608
He was always the one
who looked after me.

23:12.652 --> 23:15.959
And when he needed me the most,
I wasn't there for him.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.440
I didn't do anything.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.661
Ever since then, I've had
these deep anxiety issues

23:21.704 --> 23:23.010
and this fear
that I couldn't protect

23:23.053 --> 23:25.186
the people that I love.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.537
Until now, this vape
was the only thing

23:28.581 --> 23:30.626
getting me through it.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.456
Dude, I'm sorry
about your brother.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.240
Really, I am.

23:36.284 --> 23:37.459
Thank you.

23:37.503 --> 23:38.765
But that doesn't change
the fact

23:38.808 --> 23:40.636
that those people need
our help.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.073
Scott, hey.

23:43.117 --> 23:46.163
You can do something
about that, okay?

23:47.817 --> 23:49.210
What do you say, man, huh?

23:49.253 --> 23:52.126
We go down there
and we save them.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.171
You and me, huh?

23:55.390 --> 23:57.348
Come on, man.
You don't need that.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.090
Come on.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.537
Okay.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.234
There are four guards here

24:13.277 --> 24:15.802
and they still have a ton
outside the main gate.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.107
So we can't just walk out.

24:17.151 --> 24:19.370
No. Not the way we look.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.852
We take out these guards,
steal their clothes--

24:22.896 --> 24:25.638
And then we can just walk
right out of here.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.422
And we take
their shipment, too.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.772
Exactly.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.652
Check that.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.131
On it.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.801
Let's get changed.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.546
Let's make it quick.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.809
Hope it fits.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.508
- Eve, here.
- Thanks.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.857
Hey.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.815
And thank you for being here.

25:12.859 --> 25:15.122
I don't know
if I said that yet.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.864
Nowhere else I'd rather be.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.953
Hey.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.740
Shh.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.267
Hey.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.183
- I didn't hear anything.
- Shh.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.901
We should get changed.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.908
All right, gather and march.
Come on.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.737
Get on the raft.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.608
- Ah!
- Move it. Come on.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.350
Hey! Hey!

26:09.393 --> 26:10.394
Hey!

26:11.482 --> 26:12.962
I can't let you ship
those people

26:13.006 --> 26:15.095
off to their deaths.
- Take him!

26:15.138 --> 26:17.227
- Go. Come on, come on.
- After him.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.796
Scott! Scott, now!

26:22.581 --> 26:23.886
You're not going to die.

26:23.930 --> 26:27.716
You're not gonna die.
I am not going to die.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.852
You get back here now!

26:38.335 --> 26:39.554
Yes.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.167
Oh, hell yes.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.782
- After him!
- Quick, turn around.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.827
Scott. Scott!

26:52.654 --> 26:54.177
Run!

26:55.962 --> 26:59.008
Scott! Run!

27:00.401 --> 27:01.445
Run!

27:05.101 --> 27:08.888
You're gonna die.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.324
Get him!

27:10.367 --> 27:12.631
Must run faster!

27:13.762 --> 27:16.373
No! Oh, no!

27:16.417 --> 27:17.461
Holy mother of God.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.090
Dude.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.221
Oh, man.

27:43.705 --> 27:44.880
Oh, boy.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.447
Set the prisoners free!

27:46.490 --> 27:49.929
Dude, you really left it
to the last minute.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.672
Had to make you sweat
a little bit.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.982
Ty, am I glad to see you.

28:00.026 --> 28:01.636
You okay?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.944
Well, it really is
hard to say,

28:04.987 --> 28:06.859
but I think so, yeah.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.993
All right.
Let's go find the others.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.265
Everybody stay calm.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.715
Let's get
the hell out of here.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.977
Hyah!

28:41.371 --> 28:43.896
Hold up.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.724
Whoa.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.996
Where have you been?

28:57.039 --> 29:00.434
Sorry, we got delayed.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.044
By what?

29:03.524 --> 29:07.397
Lot of rock.
Went as fast as we could.

29:39.647 --> 29:41.083
Don't be late.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.089
Let them pass.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.398
Hyah.

30:00.581 --> 30:03.453
Where's the wagon?

30:03.497 --> 30:04.890
What do you mean?
They just left.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.675
I found the drivers tied up.

30:12.201 --> 30:15.465
Guards! Let's go!

30:21.036 --> 30:22.908
Looks like we made it.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.126
Everyone all right back there?

30:24.170 --> 30:25.606
I'm better
now that I can breathe.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.787
Damn it.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.964
We've got company!

30:45.495 --> 30:47.193
What are we gonna do?

30:50.326 --> 30:52.676
Just keep going. Keep going.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.909
Where are they?

31:49.951 --> 31:52.345
Izzy!

31:52.388 --> 31:53.520
Eve!

31:53.563 --> 31:56.262
Izzy!

32:19.676 --> 32:21.113
Eve!

32:28.729 --> 32:30.035
Eve!

32:30.078 --> 32:31.123
You okay?

32:31.166 --> 32:33.386
I'm okay. I'm okay.

32:38.521 --> 32:39.914
Thank you.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.003
Yeah.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.184
I got him.

33:00.543 --> 33:01.675
Paara!

33:22.435 --> 33:23.566
Paara.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.613
Why didn't you take the shot?

33:31.748 --> 33:33.794
I know him.

33:33.837 --> 33:36.318
How? Who is he?

33:38.929 --> 33:42.759
Paara, who is that?

33:44.935 --> 33:46.241
My husband.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.162
Look, it's Caroline.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.513
She's gonna try to adopt him.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.256
We should stop her.

34:06.609 --> 34:07.784
Josh?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.485
Those people, those are--

34:12.528 --> 34:14.878
those are my dad's
adoptive parents.

34:17.577 --> 34:20.536
That girl,
that's my aunt Jessica.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.713
I'd like you to meet
Curtis and Amanda Harris.

34:23.757 --> 34:26.064
Curtis and Amanda
are my colleagues.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.762
They've been wanting to adopt
another child for a while now,

34:28.805 --> 34:31.808
and I knew
how much they'd love you.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.248
Do you mind just giving us
a minute?

34:36.291 --> 34:38.598
Of course.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.295
Come on.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.738
I want you to know something.

34:48.782 --> 34:53.221
I think you are
the most amazing little boy.

34:53.265 --> 34:55.484
Who are you?

34:55.528 --> 34:58.270
You don't remember me at all?

35:01.142 --> 35:06.321
I can't remember anything
before a few days ago.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.758
But I feel like
I know you from somewhere.

35:08.802 --> 35:12.458
Well, you're right.
We do know each other.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.590
But it's from a long time ago.

35:14.634 --> 35:18.464
Then why aren't you
adopting me?

35:18.507 --> 35:22.120
I wish more than anything
that I could.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.688
Really, I-I do.

35:25.732 --> 35:30.258
But... you're meant to go
with my friends.

35:33.696 --> 35:37.135
One day,
I hope you'll understand.

35:37.178 --> 35:40.616
But until then,

35:40.660 --> 35:45.230
there's no one I trust more.

35:45.273 --> 35:49.321
You're gonna have
a great life with them.

35:49.364 --> 35:52.846
How do you know?

35:52.889 --> 35:55.631
I just do.

35:59.722 --> 36:05.815
Goodbye.

36:28.447 --> 36:30.405
Dr. Clark!

36:35.149 --> 36:37.847
So I guess you found me.

36:37.891 --> 36:42.678
Those people back there,
your... friends?

36:42.722 --> 36:44.985
Those are my father's
adoptive parents.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.813
How did you know that?

36:46.856 --> 36:50.469
You told me Isiah grows up
to be a man named Gavin Harris.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.514
It all made sense.

36:52.558 --> 36:56.605
I knew where
he was supposed to go.

36:56.649 --> 36:59.086
I just wanted to see him
one last time.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.262
For what it's worth, your--

37:01.306 --> 37:03.873
your friends,

37:03.917 --> 37:06.398
my grandparents,

37:06.441 --> 37:09.009
they did a really great job.

37:10.793 --> 37:15.320
I'm just glad I got to play
a small part in it.

37:19.149 --> 37:21.978
So what now?

37:23.980 --> 37:27.767
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

37:27.810 --> 37:29.943
You said you wanted
to help stop the tidal wave.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.946
Well, there's a lot
that needs to be done.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.612
- What the hell happened here?
- It's a long story.

37:46.655 --> 37:47.743
Where have you been?

37:47.787 --> 37:49.136
We were freeing
the prisoners.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.746
They're headed back to the Fort
with Paara's men.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.792
So it seems like we can say
mission accomplished?

37:52.835 --> 37:53.793
Not quite.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.535
What happened?

37:56.578 --> 37:59.189
Taamet. He escaped.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.582
You know him?

38:03.063 --> 38:05.065
They were married.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.634
Why was he here?

38:08.677 --> 38:11.332
Taamet led a rebellion
against our village.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.856
I found out and exposed him.

38:13.900 --> 38:17.730
He and his followers
were forced to leave our home.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.646
Taamet's people went on
to become the Exiles.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.125
I considered him dead.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.345
But now it seems
I must deal with him again.

38:24.389 --> 38:27.130
Why?
What do you mean by that?

38:27.174 --> 38:29.132
This is something
Taamet and his people

38:29.176 --> 38:31.396
will not soon forget.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.441
I'm afraid they'll come
for all of us.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.619
Okay, we'll deal
with that later.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.360
Right now, we need to keep
moving to the building.

38:39.404 --> 38:40.622
We'll head back
to the village,

38:40.666 --> 38:42.058
prepare for what's to come.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.556
Still think you need that
after today?

39:09.608 --> 39:11.523
I guess not.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.842
Hey, you good?

39:28.322 --> 39:31.586
I guess. I don't know.

39:31.630 --> 39:35.851
Look, I haven't known you
a long time,

39:35.895 --> 39:40.726
but what I do know is
you're a survivor.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.990
Whatever happens next,
you'll get through it.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.137
Eve?

40:04.140 --> 40:06.273
I'm not asking you
to make a choice.

40:06.316 --> 40:07.535
Not today at least.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.670
Now, I know everything
is uncertain right now,

40:11.713 --> 40:13.541
but what I do know

40:13.585 --> 40:17.197
is that my life
is nothing without you.

40:20.679 --> 40:24.030
And I want you to know,
no matter what happens,

40:24.073 --> 40:29.775
I'm gonna do whatever I have to
to win you back.

40:37.347 --> 40:38.827
Look.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.482
Whoa.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.277
What now?

41:00.153 --> 41:01.894
Okay, here we go.
