00:01.960 --> 00:04.379
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

00:23.190 --> 00:25.358
SAM: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.695
ADAMA: Helo hand-picked a crew
for you. I'm giving you a ship.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.446
HELO: We liberated
the Demetrius.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.073
It's a sewage
recycling ship.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.700
Now go.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.118
Find a way to Earth.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.121
PIKE: I'm telling you guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.997
I mean, you think that the
old man just gave her the ship

00:40.082 --> 00:41.082
and then cut her loose?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.543
Hey, that's enough
of that crap.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.670
BOOMER: The Resurrection ship
didn't make the jump.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.047
Now Cavil's Baseships are
breaking formation,

00:48.132 --> 00:49.716
taking positions
around our periphery.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.259
They're going to attack.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.177
BOOMER: They've taken out
our FTL!

00:53.262 --> 00:54.595
No Resurrection ship.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.055
They're really
trying to kill us.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.015
Stay the frak away from me!

00:58.100 --> 00:59.767
I heard you.
You're Cylons!

00:59.852 --> 01:01.894
A bunch of
frakking skin jobs.

01:02.438 --> 01:03.646
(ALARM RINGING)

01:10.821 --> 01:13.698
TORY: You think Cally killed
herself because of you, don't you?

01:13.824 --> 01:16.576
TYROL: She thought we were
having an affair. But we weren't.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.746
No, that's right. I'm not
a cheater. I'm a Cylon.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.497
I'm not a priest.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.416
But that doesn't matter,
you see.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.712
Something in
the universe loves me.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.799
God only loves that which
is perfect, and he loves you.

01:31.884 --> 01:35.845
He loves you because you
are perfect just as you are.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.959
Captain.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.091
Captain!

02:18.680 --> 02:20.640
I'm glad you're here.
I might have found something.

02:20.724 --> 02:24.727
Before that, we need to talk about
making our rendezvous with the Fleet.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.231
Later.

02:29.691 --> 02:34.570
No. No. No. No.
Come on.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.156
Here. What do you think?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.914
Well, it's hard to say.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.334
Spectroscopics
are promising.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.670
But according to this,

02:50.754 --> 02:52.922
we already did two long-range
recons of that grid.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.715
Both no joy.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.095
Third time's
a charm maybe.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.280
All right, I'll have Sharon prep to go

03:17.364 --> 03:19.532
as soon as Anders gets
back from his scout.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.748
Hey. What about you?

03:27.833 --> 03:29.458
You been getting any sleep?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.588
I don't know.
Not much.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.175
It was so clear
when I first got back.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.470
If I could...
If I just focus,

03:42.264 --> 03:44.432
I know that I can
find that sound again.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.982
I gotta go see
the CAP off.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.194
We'll talk
when I get back.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.783
Hold up.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.578
I think I'll go with you
on this one.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.335
You haven't flown a CAP
since we left the Fleet.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.337
I think I'll go with you
on this one.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.316
I need you to tell me that
all this somehow makes sense.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.736
This was my husband, James.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.614
My two children,
Danya and Reece.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.659
They were on Picon
when the Cylons attacked.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.374
What do you feel when you
look at this photograph?

04:52.084 --> 04:54.251
I feel rage.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.462
Against the Cylon.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.257
Not just the machines,
anyone involved.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.760
The engineers
who designed them.

05:03.428 --> 05:07.390
The corporations. The
politicians who provoked this war

05:07.474 --> 05:10.017
and then did nothing
to protect us.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.436
And most of all,
the Gods.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.854
The Gods?

05:14.898 --> 05:16.816
They stood by and
let it all happen.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.401
Yes, I know.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.737
I know.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.833
I am so sorry, Phoebe.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.257
Sit with us.

05:57.232 --> 06:01.444
Unfortunately, the Gods cannot be
blamed for not coming to your aid.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.322
It's not because
they weren't listening.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.078
It's because
they don't exist.

06:12.289 --> 06:16.459
The Gods we've been praying to for
thousands of years do not exist.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.463
They can't help you,
because they are not real.

06:21.465 --> 06:27.219
We have been pandering to our
own ignorance for far too long.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.307
BALTAR: (ON RADIO)
Now, on my own journey,

06:31.641 --> 06:35.352
I've been wronged,
persecuted.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.481
I prayed to the Gods

06:40.942 --> 06:44.737
on my knees, begging
them for mercy, tortured.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.324
I received nothing in...

06:49.951 --> 06:50.951
(SIGHS)

06:51.036 --> 06:52.453
(NICHOLAS CRIES)

06:57.459 --> 07:02.004
BALTAR: I could have lived
in that abyss of bitterness,

07:02.339 --> 07:04.924
but that will destroy
you like nothing else.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.926
But I chose to forgive.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.804
And most importantly,
I began with myself.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.226
ATHENA:
"Third time's the charm"?

07:16.103 --> 07:17.853
And you just
went along with it?

07:21.358 --> 07:22.525
(SIGHS)

07:23.527 --> 07:26.862
It's called following
orders, Lieutenant.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.365
It's called
dragging our feet.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.120
Starbuck's pushing our go-back
deadline to the last second,

07:34.204 --> 07:36.288
'cause she's afraid of
what Adama's gonna say

07:36.373 --> 07:39.125
when he realizes her vision
was just a pipe dream.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.005
You've got to be kidding me.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.632
MATHIAS: She's taking
a Viper out now?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.134
SEELIX: She can't be serious.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.802
PIKE: Well, maybe she could
do a little finger painting...

07:49.886 --> 07:52.721
HELO: And I've heard enough bitching
and moaning to last a lifetime.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.015
Two more days and we're
back with the Fleet, okay?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.893
Until then, everyone just
shut up and do your jobs.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.003
Come on. Come on.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.092
Come on.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.886
Starbuck, Hotdog.
Didn't catch that.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.429
What are your orders?

08:34.097 --> 08:35.639
Hotdog, Demetrius.
You know the drill.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.434
Keep your eyes open and stick
close to Starbuck's wing.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.270
I know you're
out here somewhere.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.147
STARBUCK: Come on.

08:46.151 --> 08:47.276
(BEEPING)

08:47.819 --> 08:49.361
Starbuck, dradis contact.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.363
Demetrius,
we've got an inbound.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.699
One bogey
bearing carom 1-4-9er.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.825
Roger that.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.578
Call action stations. Spool
up the FTL for emergency jump.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.747
Action stations,
action stations.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.208
Set condition one throughout
the ship. This is not a drill.

09:02.292 --> 09:06.545
Repeat, action stations, action
stations. This is not a drill.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.387
Son of a bitch,
I knew it.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.389
HOTDOG: Demetrius, Hotdog.
I've got visual.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.225
Cylon Heavy Raider.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.143
Starbuck, Demetrius. Report.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.647
Report!

09:30.904 --> 09:33.948
HOTDOG: Demetrius, I'm seeing
blast damage all over this thing.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.659
Starbuck,
what are your orders?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.662
Come on.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.623
Talk to me,
shoot me, do something.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.877
HOTDOG: Starbuck,
what are your orders?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.006
Frak.

09:52.842 --> 09:53.968
LEOBEN: Kara.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.763
I'm alone.

09:59.849 --> 10:03.227
It's not an attack.
I knew I'd find you.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.688
Knew you'd be
out here searching.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.108
Leoben?

10:09.693 --> 10:14.780
LEOBEN: I'm here for you, to offer
a truce between Cylon and human.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.368
And a chance for you
to complete your journey.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.506
(THEME MUSIC)

11:20.055 --> 11:21.847
Heavy Raider's docked
at the aft airlock.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.058
The animal part that
controls it looks dead.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.768
We only found
the one Leoben onboard.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.103
Starbuck is still taking
one hell of a chance.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.980
If he wanted to kill us,
we'd all be dead by now.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.024
Just means he wants
something else.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.543
LEOBEN: Kara.
Thank you for this.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.797
We were praying
for a miracle.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.965
It wasn't a miracle.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.592
It's like I knew
you were out there.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.636
I'm not picking up any
gamma emissions, sir.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.722
Raider's packing conventional
weaponry only. No nukes.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.017
All right. Keep checking
for tracking devices,

12:07.102 --> 12:09.561
anything that might
give up our position.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.107
Don't look at me
like that.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.900
I'm sorry, but the
difference between the way

12:14.984 --> 12:17.069
you were on New Caprica and now...

12:17.153 --> 12:18.987
I'm the same person.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.824
I have eyes.
I can see.

12:22.492 --> 12:26.662
God has taken your hand and purged
you of the questions, the doubt.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.622
Your journey
can finally begin,

12:28.706 --> 12:29.790
but there isn't
much time.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.918
The others, the ones I left
behind, they need your help.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.795
But not as much
as you need theirs.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.505
Why?

12:38.466 --> 12:41.427
Your crew,
they don't trust you.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.095
I need you to tell me
why I'm here.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.389
Captain, we should
move the prisoner.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.016
A blue planet
surrounded by clouds.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.268
You okay?

12:49.352 --> 12:50.519
Stop!

12:51.020 --> 12:52.354
(PANTING)

12:59.571 --> 13:00.863
The Hybrid.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.824
When she first
described it to me,

13:04.409 --> 13:07.619
how beautiful it was,
I cried.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.622
You need to go to her,
Kara.

13:10.707 --> 13:14.877
The Hybrid, she'll tell
you things, amazing things.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.921
We're done here.
Get him out of here.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.674
Wait!
Take him to my quarters.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.015
Just do it!

13:29.392 --> 13:31.351
MAN: Let's go. Come on.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.131
It may never
make any sense.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.593
Hangar deck crew tells me you've
been obsessing over this place,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.346
going over the logs,

14:08.598 --> 14:10.849
replaying the accident
again and again.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.602
Accident.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.271
What is it?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.815
I spoke to Cottle.

14:20.735 --> 14:25.906
Cally was on moxopan and
cosapine, antidepressants.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.745
How did she go from
antidepressants to suicide?

14:32.789 --> 14:36.583
Well, she was
emotionally disturbed.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.920
She would've left me.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.590
She never would've
left Nicky behind.

14:44.217 --> 14:48.136
So what do you think then?

14:49.013 --> 14:50.973
Someone killed her?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.560
Galen,
you have to let it go.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.687
No, I gotta figure
out what happened.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.235
What if she knew?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.281
How would she have known?

15:07.907 --> 15:11.159
Maybe she sensed it.
I mean, she was your wife.

15:11.786 --> 15:15.247
You've been different
since the nebula.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.042
Maybe she was
afraid of you.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.545
Maybe it was God's will.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.214
We don't know why
these things happen.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.758
But God does.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.262
And he has a plan for us.

15:30.972 --> 15:34.850
For whatever reason,
her death, our awakening,

15:34.934 --> 15:37.352
you gotta trust that
it's all for the best.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.937
Why are you here?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.231
Because we are
in this together.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.318
And I am
here for you, Galen.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.196
I know exactly where you are
right now. I have been there.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.783
Until Gaius helped
me realize that...

15:53.578 --> 15:55.037
What?

15:55.121 --> 16:00.000
Whatever has gone before, whatever
I have done, it doesn't matter.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.505
We can still change.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.178
You spend way too much time with Baltar.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.820
SAM: So I guess I missed
all the excitement, huh?

16:29.447 --> 16:31.990
So what's the deal? This
Leoben, has he said anything?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.408
Don't know.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.995
Starbuck ordered the guards to
wait outside, lose the cuffs.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.331
Said she didn't
want to be disturbed.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.834
Guess I'll talk to her.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.586
Yeah, why don't
you do that?

17:02.063 --> 17:04.356
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get the hell away from her.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.149
Sam, what the hell...
Sam, stop it!

17:06.275 --> 17:07.818
What is wrong with you, Kara? Stop it!

17:09.445 --> 17:11.238
SAM: Marines, in here now! I
can see why she's fond of you.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.781
STARBUCK: Leave him alone.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.743
You know what
we have to do.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.287
Just remember
there isn't much time.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.914
Get him the frak out of here!

17:20.998 --> 17:23.458
Cuff him and
lock him in storage!

17:25.420 --> 17:27.796
What is going on with you?
Kara!

17:28.923 --> 17:30.424
He can help us.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.801
The Cylons, they understand about Earth.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.302
And you believe him?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.179
After everything
he's done to you?

17:36.806 --> 17:39.891
Kara, he kept you locked up
for months on New Caprica.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.977
The frakking mind games.

17:43.813 --> 17:47.149
I swear to Gods,
this is not a dream.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.526
It's real.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.751
I'm glad you're here.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.503
You and Kara, did you
get things worked out?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.338
Because you should.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.383
You weren't meant
to be enemies.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.510
No. That'd be you and me.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.143
The same thing
I've always wanted.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.605
For her to understand
her destiny.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.690
That's not good enough.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.525
LEOBEN: It's good enough
for her.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.327
What is the most
basic article of faith?

18:43.206 --> 18:45.540
That this is not
all that we are.

18:53.883 --> 18:54.966
(CHUCKLING)

18:56.928 --> 18:58.720

18:59.013 --> 19:00.013
What did you just say?

19:00.097 --> 19:01.890
Forward guard, right?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.392
I saw a couple of games.
You were good.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.646
Yet after all the celebrity
and acclaim, what were you?

19:07.730 --> 19:09.272
Just another face
selling magazines,

19:09.357 --> 19:10.482
another piece of
scoreboard trivia.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.818
You always knew you
were destined for more.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.988
You were just waiting for your
singular moment of clarity.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.950
Well, maybe I just found it.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.744
You kill me,
Kara's dream dies with me.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.330
I don't think so.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.917
I think you download into another
Leoben body and you spew more lies.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.089
No one's coming back.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.928
We were lured out
of resurrection range.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.930
Ship was attacked.
We survived.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.431
The Baseship was damaged.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.350
We were set adrift.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.230
What are you talking about?
Who attacked you?

19:53.985 --> 19:56.152
War has broken out
between the Cylon.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.781
Battle lines have been drawn

19:59.866 --> 20:04.286
between those who embrace their
nature and those who fear it.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.455
Good.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.834
You can blow yourselves
to hell for all I care.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.211
That's one way, that's
one way. There's another.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.713
An alliance.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.092
Allow our paths to converge.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.221
You save us from
our savage brothers,

20:23.306 --> 20:28.184
and our old one, the Hybrid,
will show Kara the righteous path.

20:29.103 --> 20:32.606
And together, they'll lead
us to the promised land.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.609
Together, we will find Earth.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.947
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:45.703 --> 20:47.412
He said his Baseship
was attacked,

20:47.496 --> 20:49.706
that they were ambushed
by their own kind.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.085
So now the Cylons want us
to rescue them. That's novel.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.754
Well, he's proposing
an alliance

20:55.838 --> 20:58.590
between us and his
damaged Baseship.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.508
How's that
supposed to work?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.177
Yeah, right. Are we supposed to let them

21:02.261 --> 21:03.803
piggyback on our nav
and FTL systems

21:03.888 --> 21:06.264
and help them jump
out of harm's way?

21:06.349 --> 21:08.183
They'll join forces
with the Fleet.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.684
Right.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.394
If it's true.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.021
What the frak?

21:13.356 --> 21:14.940
Are you actually thinking
about doing this?

21:15.024 --> 21:16.608
XO, listen.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.069
Bringing Leoben on board,
that was questionable at best.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.320
But jumping back
to his Baseship?

21:20.446 --> 21:21.613
It's suicide.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.615
Nothing's been decided.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.409
And what? You trust Starbuck
to make the right decision?

21:26.494 --> 21:27.869
'Cause she's out of control.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.287
SAM: Well,
what are you saying?

21:29.372 --> 21:31.289
We are running
on fumes, Anders.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.375
In two days,
we are gonna be overdue

21:33.459 --> 21:35.585
for our rendezvous
with the Fleet.

21:35.670 --> 21:39.381
We gotta do something before
she takes us all down with her.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.550
Are you talking mutiny?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.594
'Cause that's sure
what it sounds like.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.806
You want to tear
this ship apart,

21:47.890 --> 21:50.767
then keep riling up the crew
making your crazy Starbuck cracks.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.061
Otherwise, I suggest you
both shut the frak up.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.147
Starbuck is leading us
into a trap.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.650
Cylons are gonna
capture the freighter.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.153
They're gonna have nav data
leading straight back to the Fleet.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.031
STARBUCK: Then we better
keep that from happening.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.452
Order the CAP back
and lock down the ship.

22:09.537 --> 22:10.996
As soon as we can work
through the jump coordinates

22:11.080 --> 22:13.248
from Leoben's Raider,
we go.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.334
It's a chance
to find Earth!

22:18.170 --> 22:19.629
I intend to take it.

arrested recently or beaten up,

22:38.357 --> 22:41.735
can I... Can I surmise
that the President

22:41.819 --> 22:44.863
has not been apprised
of my pirate broadcasts?

22:47.283 --> 22:49.451

she speak to the Admiral.

do something about that.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.387
Or not.

Even Roslin and Adama must realize the
movement's taken on a life of its own.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.732
It's gonna take them more than
bashing in a few heads to stop this.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.903
The truth is you're not worth
another confrontation in the Quorum.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.282
You may be drawing more
bodies to your crusade,

It doesn't matter. They're
not coming to be fed.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.091
They're coming to
hear Dr. Baltar's word

23:46.175 --> 23:48.510
and learn from it,
just like we did.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.857
The past is written,

24:05.111 --> 24:06.945
impossible to change.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.659
Why are so many of us
living in the past,

24:15.871 --> 24:18.706
living with the shame
of what we have done,

24:20.709 --> 24:24.963
when we could live
in awe of what we might do?

24:25.923 --> 24:27.590
What we might do.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.677
What will we do?

24:31.720 --> 24:34.222
Spiral endlessly
through the heavens

24:34.932 --> 24:37.725
until humanity itself
comes to a close?

24:41.438 --> 24:43.273
Or do we look inward

24:45.818 --> 24:47.569
and find that strength within?

24:47.653 --> 24:51.406
Can you believe these people are
actually buying into Baltar's crap?

32:06.383 --> 32:07.592
Do it!

32:08.385 --> 32:09.594
(GRUNTS)

32:11.555 --> 32:12.680
(PANTING)

32:16.643 --> 32:19.979
It doesn't help,
does it?

32:24.151 --> 32:26.861
Nothing feels quite
like it did before.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.530
Does it?

32:33.535 --> 32:35.578
What are you doing to me?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.125
All of your life,

32:44.755 --> 32:49.216
you forced back the truth by
lashing out at everyone around you.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.803
Anesthetizing yourself with
ambrosia and empty affairs.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.973
But you've lost the taste
for those petty things.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.475
I'm the same person.

32:57.559 --> 33:00.186
No. There's a void, an
emptiness that can only be filled

33:00.270 --> 33:02.480
by taking the next
step on your journey.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.816
What happened to me the
two months I was missing?

33:05.901 --> 33:07.318
I don't know.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.071
The mandala, the paintings, my mother.

33:10.864 --> 33:11.906
It had to mean something.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.659
You have to make
peace with your past.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.411
Why?

33:17.537 --> 33:19.246
Because that part of you
is gone.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.875
I told you when I first came aboard
this ship that you had changed.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.585
I look at you now.
I don't see Kara Thrace.

33:24.670 --> 33:29.006
I see an angel blazing
with the light of God,

33:29.216 --> 33:32.426
an angel eager to
lead her people home.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.891
This is bad.
This is really bad.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.434
She can't
explain this one away.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.728
So you think
she's a Cylon now?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.691
Starbuck's racked up more kills
than any pilot in the Fleet.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.859
Yeah, Starbuck maybe.

33:48.944 --> 33:52.613
Okay, but who the hell knows who
got off that Viper two months ago?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.756
I'm not really
very good at any of this.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.678
We've all come to
remember Sgt. Erin Mathias,

34:16.430 --> 34:19.682
to grieve for our loss,
to honor her.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.687
Mathias is dead
because of me.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.772
We've all heard the words,
the prayers,

34:26.857 --> 34:29.525
but I don't know what
any of it means anymore.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.445
We want to believe that
she died for something.

34:33.697 --> 34:37.116
But in this war, people
die and it is just stupid.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.744
It's an accident.
There's no nobility to it.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.120
There's nothing
we can grab onto

34:41.204 --> 34:44.248
that's gonna make it any
easier. They're just gone.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.210
I have to live with that.

34:53.675 --> 34:57.720
You know, I know that this
has been a difficult mission

34:57.804 --> 35:01.223
and maybe I haven't...

35:16.573 --> 35:20.576
Captain, we've downloaded the
rendezvous coordinates to the FTL.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.579
We're ready to jump back
to the Fleet on your order.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.832
We're not going
back to the Fleet.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.543
What the hell are
you talking about?

35:29.628 --> 35:30.878
We came here to
complete a mission,

35:30.962 --> 35:33.172
and that Baseship has something
to do with it. I know it.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.465
No.

35:34.591 --> 35:38.385
Capt. Agathon. Lock down
the ship. Prepare to jump.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.976
No. You know what? Frak her and
frak her little pet Cylon, okay?

35:46.061 --> 35:47.019
Pike! Pike!

35:47.103 --> 35:50.689
The Baseship was never part of the
mission. Okay, one of us is dead now.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.483
One of us is dead, and if
we don't leave right now

35:52.567 --> 35:54.735
we're all going to die,
all right?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.362
Let it go...
Just let it go, Pike!

35:56.446 --> 35:57.738
Pike, you stand down!

35:57.906 --> 35:59.198
PIKE: If I don't do anything,
we're all gonna die!

35:59.282 --> 36:01.242
Get out of my way. You have
your orders, Pike. Now back off!

36:01.326 --> 36:03.744
You better choose which
side you're on, Captain.

36:03.829 --> 36:07.206
Walk away. Walk away, and
this doesn't go any further!

36:07.290 --> 36:10.209
Yeah, you'd be the one to
protect that Cylon thing, right?

36:10.293 --> 36:11.418
(GRUNTING)

36:44.411 --> 36:46.704
Gaius, I just don't understand
what you're trying to accomplish.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.747
I mean, this man is psychotic.
My message is for everyone,

36:48.832 --> 36:50.040
especially the ones
who don't want to listen.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.125
I just don't think
it's safe.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.334
Five minutes,
that's all.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.961
(KNOCKING)

37:00.260 --> 37:01.552
Mr. Tyrol.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.722
JEANNE: Gaius,
I really don't think...

37:04.806 --> 37:06.056
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.516
Be careful.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.117
Look, Chief, I...

37:30.665 --> 37:34.835
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness
about my presumption earlier.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.005
You were right,
you know.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.676
I hardly knew your wife.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.386
I'm sorry.

37:50.810 --> 37:54.146
Would you mind if I just...

38:04.032 --> 38:05.783
I know it's hard

38:07.619 --> 38:09.912
to make sense of
things sometimes.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.082
In my own life...

38:15.001 --> 38:17.920
In my own life, I joined the
Fleet as a scientist, as a skeptic,

38:18.004 --> 38:20.255
as supposedly
a man of reason.

38:24.970 --> 38:28.806
Only to have fate
turn that all on its head.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.977
But I understand now that
there is a purpose to it.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.436
We change.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.730
We evolve.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.027
Maybe we even learn
something along the way.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.082
I have committed

38:58.586 --> 39:00.754
unconscionable crimes,

39:02.507 --> 39:05.509
and I have been offered one
last chance at redemption,

39:08.847 --> 39:12.433
because I chose to accept my
fate, not fight it anymore.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.490
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Chief.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.537
She was a very beautiful
woman, your wife.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.789
I'm also told
quite spiritual.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.292
You know, I don't
expect you to believe me,

39:41.129 --> 39:43.964
but I would've very much
have liked to know her better.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.025
(BALTAR SIGHS)

40:05.195 --> 40:06.528
BALTAR: Thank you.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.372
GAETA: Action stations,
action stations.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.583
Set condition one
throughout the ship.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.002
Are you really
gonna do this?

40:25.507 --> 40:27.424
I don't have any choice.

40:29.302 --> 40:31.512
Yes, you do.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.230
FTL's spooled, Captain.

40:41.314 --> 40:42.523
Good.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.566
Set the clock.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.237
Captain.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.907
Captain, I'm asking you
to reconsider.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.617
There's not enough time.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.953
We don't go now,
we lose our shot.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.746
GAETA: That's assuming
we believe the Cylon.

40:57.831 --> 41:00.124
That's assuming we believe that
Leoben's coordinates are right.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.543
We don't jump into a nest of
Baseships or the middle of a star...

41:02.627 --> 41:05.087
Galactica's
standing orders are clear.

41:05.171 --> 41:08.674
If we miss the rendezvous, Adama
will assume we're dead or captured.

41:08.758 --> 41:09.758
They will leave us.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.802
No. Not Adama.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.138
Listen to me, we can
jump back to Galactica.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.390
Okay, if the Admiral's
for it, we can re-supply,

41:16.474 --> 41:18.100
send out an armed patrol.

41:19.519 --> 41:22.187
Do not do this, Helo.

41:31.156 --> 41:34.116
I can't allow you to risk
the lives of this ship's crew.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.492
When the Admiral
put me in command,

41:35.577 --> 41:37.703
he told me to
trust my instincts,

41:37.787 --> 41:39.413
find the next marker,
see if it checks out,

41:39.497 --> 41:42.708
lead the people
from the Fleet home.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.751
That is what I intend to do.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.129
Now, prepare to jump!

41:50.300 --> 41:53.886
I'm sorry, sir, but I
cannot obey that order.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.104
Then you are relieved,
Captain.

42:17.619 --> 42:20.829
Mr. Gaeta,
you are now the new XO.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.000
Prepare to jump
on my mark.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.294
No, sir.

42:28.504 --> 42:31.590
Okay, everybody needs to think
about what they're doing here.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.093
They have
thought about it, Sam.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.810
They all have.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.771
It's a mutiny.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.444
Capt. Thrace,
as XO of the Demetrius,

42:52.528 --> 42:56.281
and acting under Article 10
of the Colonial Military Code,

42:58.326 --> 43:00.911
I'm hereby relieving you
of command.
