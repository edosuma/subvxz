TEACHER: Well, how about that?

00:37.500 --> 00:41.708
That was almost 20 full minutes
devoted to the application of Band-Aids.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.750
Thank you, Baymax, for coming in to visit.

I'll see you all after lunch
for the talent show,

00:48.916 --> 00:51.125
which I will judge harshly, but fairly.

00:52.291 --> 00:53.875
Come on, Ali. We got this.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.500
Lana and Tariq.

01:00.541 --> 01:01.666
Nice kids,

01:01.750 --> 01:03.000
no sense of showmanship.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.916
I'm going to go use the bathroom.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.750
I'll meet you before the show to practice.

01:06.833 --> 01:07.875
Not that we need it.

Oh, no, no, no.

(GASPS)

01:29.750 --> 01:31.708
Hello. My name is Baymax.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.833
I was alerted to the need
for medical attention

01:33.916 --> 01:36.875
when you said,
"Oh, no, no, no, no."

01:36.958 --> 01:37.958
I'm fine.

01:38.291 --> 01:41.041
Don't need any... robot nurse help.

01:41.125 --> 01:44.375
Just a normal kid
having a normal bathroom experience.

01:44.458 --> 01:45.916
-I will scan you now.
-Wait, what...

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Scan complete.

01:47.083 --> 01:50.250
You have mild seasonal allergies
and are currently menstruating.

01:51.958 --> 01:53.416
I just got my first period.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.916
-Correct.
-But my stomach hurts.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.875
Mild abdominal cramping
is typical.

01:56.958 --> 01:59.708
I can't believe this is happening.
This isn't supposed to...

01:59.791 --> 02:01.833
I can't!
I wasn't prepared for this.

02:01.916 --> 02:04.666
And the dispenser is empty,
and I don't even have a thing.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.208
The thing, you know... a tampad.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.291
A padpon.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.666
Uh, uh...
A maxi padpon with wings.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.666
You are referring to
menstrual hygiene materials.

02:15.750 --> 02:16.875
I will be right back.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.708
Excuse me... Oh, okay.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.750
You know what? Let me...
Oh, no. Okay.

(SIGHS)

02:29.708 --> 02:30.708
Hmm.

02:41.625 --> 02:42.625
BAYMAX: Excuse me.

02:42.708 --> 02:45.000
Which of these products
would you recommend?

02:47.083 --> 02:48.875
Oh! Um... Uh...

02:48.958 --> 02:52.375
Well, these are the tampons I usually use.

02:52.458 --> 02:53.791
-Thank you.
-WOMAN 1: I prefer pads.

02:53.875 --> 02:55.791
-They're more comfortable for me.
-Thank you.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.791
-I always get the ones with wings.
-Thank you.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.625
Get unscented
and bleach free, if you can.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.666
-Yo, my daughter loves these.
-BAYMAX: Thank you.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.791
WOMAN 2: These might be easier
if it's her first period.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.916
-BAYMAX: Thank you.
-These are environmentally friendly.

03:22.958 --> 03:24.583
I have brought you a variety.

your preferred sanitary napkin.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.750
No one calls them that, Baymax.

03:40.791 --> 03:42.708
Okay, so this one...

03:43.375 --> 03:44.541
Well, this one has...

03:46.000 --> 03:48.083
Wow. I have no idea how to use that.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.458
If you require, I can pull up
an instructive video to show you how...

03:51.541 --> 03:52.666
No, no, no.

03:52.958 --> 03:54.125
I don't want this!

SOFIA: Baymax, don't listen.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.875
BAYMAX: Now you are able
to return to class.

04:21.958 --> 04:22.958
Back to class?

04:23.041 --> 04:24.041
Are you kidding?

04:24.125 --> 04:26.500
I'm not going back to class,
or anywhere.

04:26.583 --> 04:29.083
No. No, no. I live in this bathroom now.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.250
Do you think they'll let me paint
an accent wall in here?

04:32.333 --> 04:35.541
ALI: (KNOCKS) Uh...
Sofia, are you okay in there?

04:35.625 --> 04:36.625
What's up, Ali?

04:37.041 --> 04:38.916
Sofia, is everything okay...

04:39.375 --> 04:40.375
Well, wow.

04:40.458 --> 04:43.708
Okay, you've really got
your own thing going on in here.

04:43.791 --> 04:46.000
We have, like, five minutes
before the talent show.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.583
Oh! Talent show!

04:47.666 --> 04:50.416
Aw! Ali, I completely forgot.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.000
I got my first period

04:52.083 --> 04:53.666
and my guts feel tied up in knots,

04:53.750 --> 04:55.625
and my insides are
coming out of my outsides,

04:55.708 --> 04:56.791
and my childhood is over!

04:56.875 --> 04:59.500
Oh, that's a lot of information
for me to process.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.166
I'm sorry.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.250
Congratulations.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.875
No, neither of those sound right.

05:04.958 --> 05:06.666
Look, it's really not that big of a deal.

05:06.750 --> 05:07.916
Are you freaking kidding me?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.166
Not a big deal?

05:09.250 --> 05:10.666
Okay, okay. It's okay.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.875
Well, my sister,
she says it's good,

05:13.958 --> 05:16.625
because you can sometimes
get out of gym class.

05:16.708 --> 05:18.125
But I love gym class.

05:18.208 --> 05:21.666
Exercise can be helpful
for menstruation related cramping.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.166
ALI: Sofia.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.791
This show is all we've been talking about,

05:26.875 --> 05:28.666
and I can't jump, catch myself,

05:28.750 --> 05:30.875
and then do opposite direction
yoyo throws.

05:30.958 --> 05:31.958
I'm just one kid.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.416

with our choreography.

-The show's starting.

05:35.958 --> 05:37.791
Please, please come, Sofia.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.875
It's a middle school talent show
for Pete's sake.

05:40.958 --> 05:43.625
These kids will eat me alive.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.083
(GRUNTS)

05:57.500 --> 05:59.750
BAYMAX: Why do you not want to perform
in the talent show?

06:00.416 --> 06:01.416
It's not...

06:01.625 --> 06:04.083
I just... I can't.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.791
BAYMAX: It is common for people
to feel embarrassed,

06:08.875 --> 06:12.375
fearful or uncomfortable
with the subject of menstruation.

06:12.458 --> 06:14.125
But it is just biology.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.708
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

06:15.791 --> 06:18.750
No, no, Baymax,
it's not that. It's...

06:19.708 --> 06:22.416
I remember when
my cousin Valerie got her period.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.500
My <i>t√≠a</i> Mariana wouldn't stop
calling her <i>mi mujercita</i>

06:25.583 --> 06:28.416
and everyone started
treating her differently.

06:29.333 --> 06:30.875
I'm not ready for that.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.416
I'm not done being a kid yet.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.041
BAYMAX: You are 12-years-old.

06:44.541 --> 06:47.750
By many cultural standards,
you are still a child.

06:47.833 --> 06:49.791
A pre-teenager or "tween."

06:49.875 --> 06:52.791
But getting your period
is supposed to be like this...

06:52.875 --> 06:56.208
huge deal, and it means I'm different now.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.666
-Right?
-BAYMAX: You are getting older.

06:59.208 --> 07:03.666
Your body may change,
but you will always be you.

07:24.458 --> 07:25.750
How do you feel?

07:26.625 --> 07:31.416
I feel like the kid who's gonna
kick serious butt in this talent show.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.166
