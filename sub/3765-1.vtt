KAREN: Gray?

02:16.920 --> 02:18.888
Honey, what are you doing?

02:19.040 --> 02:20.565
What is this?
Here. Let's go.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.643
Come on, honey.
Your flight's in two hours.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.083
Dane County Airport is 36 minutes away,
60 with traffic.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.851
How many minutes to get
your little butt in the van?

02:28.960 --> 02:29.961
Hmm?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.086
How many of those?

02:32.960 --> 02:35.088
Feed the monster under your bed?
GRAY: Yes.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.002
Call me every day,

02:40.080 --> 02:42.845
and text me pics,
so I don't forget what you look like.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.121
I'm only gonna
be gone a week.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.247
SCOTT: Zach.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.766
You're not going off
to war here. Please.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.166
Come on.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.084
I will see you later.
I love you.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.611
I know it hurts,
sweetheart.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.085
Are you gonna be okay?

03:11.040 --> 03:12.121
Everything right on there?

03:12.920 --> 03:14.445
I'm so jealous.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.251
You're gonna have so much fun.
I love you.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.924
I love you, too.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.569
Okay, great.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.564
All right, um, let's give these
to your brother, okay?

03:31.240 --> 03:33.447
You hold these, please.
Can you hold these?
Zach.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.170
Honey, I need you to
take care of these.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.088
Yeah.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.280
SCOTT: Hey.
KAREN: All right.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.481
Listen to your mother.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.080
KAREN: Take care of your brother.
Answer your phone.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.890
I'm serious.
It's the green button.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.962

Bye.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.564
I miss you already.
Yeah.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.371
So much for our
last family breakfast.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.681
Why do you have to
say things like that?

04:06.200 --> 04:08.089
SCOTT: Did you
call your sister?

04:08.160 --> 04:10.162
Straight to voice-mail.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.489
SCOTT: It'll be fine.
She handles 20,000 people a day, right?

04:14.600 --> 04:16.488
She can handle two more.

is the island?</i>

04:22.040 --> 04:23.769
Big.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.365
But how many pounds?

04:25.440 --> 04:26.805
ZACH: That
doesn't make sense.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.965
GRAY: When they first opened,
they had eight species.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.970
Now they have 14 herbivores
and six carnivores.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.804

Nope.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.167
Welcome to Jurassic World.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.000
While year over year,
revenue continues to climb,

07:07.080 --> 07:09.321
operating costs
are higher than ever.

07:09.400 --> 07:13.121
Our shareholders have been patient,
but let's be honest,

07:13.200 --> 07:16.283
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.489
Twenty years ago,
de-extinction was right up there with magic.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.289
These days, kids
look at a <i>Stegosaurus</i>

07:21.360 --> 07:23.727
like an elephant
from the city zoo.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.167
That doesn't mean
asset development is falling behind.

07:26.720 --> 07:30.611
Our DNA excavators
discover new species every year.

07:30.720 --> 07:35.248
But consumers want them bigger,
louder, more teeth.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.365
The good news?

07:37.480 --> 07:40.529
Our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.564
We've learned more from
genetics in the past decade

07:44.640 --> 07:46.642
than a century of
digging up bones.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.601

07:49.680 --> 07:52.570

Don't we all?

08:02.840 --> 08:04.330

08:04.400 --> 08:07.165
Our first genetically
modified hybrid.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.642
How did you get two different
kinds of dinosaurs to, you know...

08:11.560 --> 08:15.167
Oh, <i>Indominus</i> wasn't bred.
She was designed.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.487
She will be 50 feet
long when fully grown.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.250
Bigger than the T. rex.

08:21.360 --> 08:25.081
Every time we've unveiled a new asset,

10:07.680 --> 10:09.569
Seven years,
but, you know, close.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.327
So, I see you already
got your wristbands.

Oh, this? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

I got it for $150,
but the mint condition one goes for $300...

Didn't occur to you maybe
that's in poor taste?

Yeah, no, it did.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.408
and not once did
he mention profits.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.608
"Spare no expense,"
he used to say.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.681
I appreciate that,

14:57.760 --> 15:01.207
but the reality of operating
a theme park requires...

15:01.320 --> 15:03.322
Don't forget why we
built this place, Claire.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.722
Jurassic World exists to
remind us how very small we are.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.844
How new. You can't
put a price on that.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.328
Now, please, we're flying.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.203
Breathe.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.526
(GASPS)

15:43.600 --> 15:45.489
Is he okay?
Are you okay?

15:45.560 --> 15:47.927
He's just being dramatic.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.809
Are you still building?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.363
We planned to open in May,

15:52.440 --> 15:56.206
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.362
It's bigger than expected.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.925
It's a good sign.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.684
We hit a few
speed bumps early on.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.889
It began to anticipate
where the food would come from.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.889
One of the handlers
nearly lost an arm.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.885
The others threatened to quit if
I couldn't guarantee their safety.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.209
She's intelligent then?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.409
For a dinosaur.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.568
And that?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.804
It tried to break the glass.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.928
I like her spirit.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.610
(GROWLING)

16:57.280 --> 17:00.841
It's white. You never
told me it was white.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.442
Think it will scare the kids?

17:09.599 --> 17:11.204
The kids?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.367
This will give the
parents nightmares.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.483
Is that good?

17:19.400 --> 17:21.607
It's fantastic.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.404
Can she see us?

17:28.079 --> 17:30.208
They say it can
sense thermal radiation.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.611
Like snakes.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.688
I thought there
were two of them.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.247
There was a sibling
in case this one didn't survive infancy.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.322
Where's the sibling?

17:40.440 --> 17:41.487
She ate it.

17:42.920 --> 17:43.921
(SIGHS)

17:49.640 --> 17:53.326
So, the paddock is
quite safe, then?

17:53.440 --> 17:58.002
We have the best
structural engineers in the world.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.161
Yeah, so did Hammond.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.327
There's an American
Navy man here.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.370
Part of a research program
one of my companies is running.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.130
Owen Grady.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.401
I know who he is.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.443
MASRANI: His animals
often try to escape.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.444
They are smart.
He has to be smarter.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.249
He only thinks he's smarter.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.689
I want you to bring him in.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.765
Let him inspect the paddock.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.326
Maybe he sees
something we can't.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.723
I was starting to think
I hired the wrong guys,

20:12.800 --> 20:14.802
but, damn, you got them
eating out of your palm.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.080
You came on a good day.
It's not usually a happy ending.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.884
Is that why you're not
sending in your reports?

20:18.960 --> 20:20.371
We've been busy.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.046
Not too busy to
cash your paychecks.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.165
What do you need, buddy?

20:25.920 --> 20:26.921
A field test.

20:27.880 --> 20:31.407
Hey. I've just seen they can
respond to commands.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.926
We need to take the research
and get it on its feet.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.365
These are wild animals, Hoskins.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.283
Trust me, you don't
want them in the field.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.569
I just saw a bond.
A real bond.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.768
Between man and beast.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.841
You're in my way.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.285
Come on.
We're the same.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.850
We're dogs of war.

20:46.960 --> 20:50.009
We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.082
Some people think that
robots are the future.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.731
Look, nature gave
us the most effective

20:54.800 --> 20:57.371

million years ago.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.926
And now we know
they can take orders.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.685
We finally make progress
and that's the first thing he says?

21:02.760 --> 21:04.364

Come on, gents.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.362
It's grown-up time.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.161
Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.605
The minute a real
war breaks out,

21:14.680 --> 21:16.967
all that fancy
tech is gonna go dark.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.044
But that tech's not gonna eat them
if they forget to feed it.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.529
Look at these creatures.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.444
They've got millions
of years of instinct in their cells,

21:25.520 --> 21:26.680
instinct that we can program.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.167
Their loyalty cannot be bought.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.371
These guys are gonna run

21:32.440 --> 21:34.408
straight into the enemy's
teeth and eat them,

21:34.560 --> 21:36.483

21:36.560 --> 21:38.961
What if they decide
they wanna be in control?

21:39.640 --> 21:42.211
Well, then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.

You come here

21:52.520 --> 21:54.090
and you don't learn
anything about these animals

21:54.160 --> 21:55.844
except what you want to know.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.686
You made them,
and now you think you own them.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.490
We do own them.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.402
Extinct animals have no rights.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.331
They're not extinct
anymore, Hoskins.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.688
Exactly. We're
sitting on a goldmine.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.128
And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.050

some humility. He doesn't make weapons.

he doesn't even know what he owns.

been practicing this pitch?

You knew the end game.

These animals can replace
thousands of boots on the ground.

would that save?

28:22.560 --> 28:24.449
I'm sorry, but you know,
I have to tell you, they work.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.290
<i>You'll see when you have kids.</i>

28:26.360 --> 28:27.441
Yeah, "if."

28:27.640 --> 28:31.008
"When." It's worth it.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.810
Bye, Mom.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.721
Bye.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.770
What do they want now?

28:55.920 --> 28:56.967
CLAIRE: Mr. Grady?

28:58.200 --> 29:01.807
I need you to come
take a look at something.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.283
Why are you calling
me Mr. Grady?

29:05.400 --> 29:06.811
Owen.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.766
If you're not too busy.

29:09.840 --> 29:10.966
I'm pretty busy.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.610
We have an attraction.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.603
That's not what you said
the last time I saw you.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.921
I'm talking about
the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.525
Owen.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.722
A new species we've made.
(FLY BUZZING)

29:23.840 --> 29:26.844
You just went and
made a new dinosaur?

29:26.920 --> 29:30.003
Yeah, it's kind
of what we do here.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.960
The exhibit opens to the public
in three weeks.

29:32.040 --> 29:36.125
Mr. Masrani wanted me
to consult with you.

29:36.200 --> 29:40.444
You wanna consult
here or in my bungalow?

29:41.320 --> 29:42.970
That's not funny.
(LAUGHS)

29:43.600 --> 29:45.045
A little funny.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.010
We'd like you to evaluate the
paddock for vulnerabilities.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.730
Why me?

29:50.240 --> 29:56.521
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you're able to control the Raptors...

29:56.680 --> 29:57.966
It's all about control with you.

29:58.040 --> 30:01.249
I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.567
It's based on mutual respect.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.762
That's why you and I
never had a second date.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.691
Excuse me?
I never wanted a second date.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.728
Who prints out an
itinerary for a night out?

30:11.840 --> 30:13.410
I'm an organized person.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.046
What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?

30:16.120 --> 30:17.804
All of them,
actually.

30:17.920 --> 30:22.289
And what kind of a man shows
up to a date in board shorts?

30:22.440 --> 30:24.442
It's Central America.
It's hot. Okay. Okay.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.450
Can we just focus
on the asset, please?

30:27.600 --> 30:28.965
The asset?

30:29.880 --> 30:32.850
Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.160
You gotta make a lot
of tough decisions.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.605
It's probably easier
to pretend these animals

30:35.680 --> 30:38.081
are just numbers
on a spreadsheet.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.845
But they're not.
They're alive.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.602
I'm fully aware they're alive.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.405
You might have made them in a test tube,
but they don't know that.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.722
They're thinking,
"I gotta eat.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.284
"I gotta hunt. I gotta..."

30:54.240 --> 30:57.847
You can relate to at
least one of those things.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.126
Right?

31:02.760 --> 31:03.921
I'll be in the car.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.206
You might want to
change your shirt.

31:10.280 --> 31:13.489
They're very sensitive to smell.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.247
WOMAN ON MICROPHONE:
<i>The Mosasaurus</i>

31:24.360 --> 31:26.966
<i>was thought to have
hunted near the surface of the water</i>

31:27.080 --> 31:30.323
<i>where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into,</i>

31:30.440 --> 31:35.970
<i>including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurs.</i>

31:36.160 --> 31:40.848
<i>Okay, folks, let's see if she's still
hungry after already eating today.</i>

31:41.560 --> 31:45.565
<i>She's a little shy, so be nice and
give her a hand when she comes out.</i>

31:45.720 --> 31:47.290
Zach, Zach!

31:47.440 --> 31:48.440
<i>The Mosasaurus!</i>

31:49.080 --> 31:50.241
(GROWLING)

31:50.920 --> 31:51.921
(ALL GASPING)

32:00.520 --> 32:03.046
Oh, my God!
That was awesome!

32:06.480 --> 32:07.480
WOMAN: <i>Hold on tight.</i>

32:07.520 --> 32:11.809
<i>We're gonna give you
an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.</i>

32:26.200 --> 32:27.690
It had 88 teeth!
(LAUGHS)

32:29.400 --> 32:31.801
Wanna see something else cool?
Yeah!

32:39.080 --> 32:42.209
CLAIRE: We've been
pre-booking tickets for months.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.131
The park needs a new
attraction every few years

32:45.200 --> 32:47.487
in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.483
Kind of like the space program.

32:49.560 --> 32:53.121
Corporate felt genetic modification
would up the wow factor.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.288
They're dinosaurs.
Wow enough.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.767
Not according to
our focus groups.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.081
The <i>Indominus rex</i>
makes us relevant again.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.202
(CHUCKLING)
The <i>Indominus rex?</i>

33:02.280 --> 33:05.329
We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.771
You should hear
a four-year-old

33:06.880 --> 33:08.962
try to say
<i>"Archaeornithomimus."</i>

33:09.080 --> 33:11.321
You should hear
you try to say it.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.484
So what's this thing made of?

33:19.200 --> 33:23.967
The base genome is a T. rex.
The rest is classified.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.771
You made a new dinosaur,
but you don't even know what it is?

33:26.840 --> 33:28.808
The lab delivers
us finished assets,

33:28.880 --> 33:30.245
and we show
them to the public.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.323
Can we drop a steer, please?

33:32.440 --> 33:34.329
How long has the
animal been in here?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.411
All its life.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.767
Never seen anything
outside of these walls?

33:38.880 --> 33:40.166
We can't exactly walk it.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.805
And you feed it with that?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.804
Is there a problem?

33:49.040 --> 33:52.283
Animals raised in isolation aren't
always the most functional.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.890
Your Raptors are
born in captivity.

33:55.960 --> 33:59.442
With siblings.
They learn social skills.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.170
And I imprint on
them when they're born.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.606
There's trust.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.810
The only positive relationship this
animal has is with that crane.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.284
At least she
knows that means food.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.330
So, she needs a friend.

34:12.440 --> 34:15.808
We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?

34:15.960 --> 34:17.724
Probably not a good idea.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.239
Where is it?

34:23.320 --> 34:24.481
Is it in the basement?

34:24.639 --> 34:28.007
Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.322
It was just here.
We were just here.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.246
(BUZZING)

34:39.159 --> 34:41.003
GUARD: Oh, shit.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.882
That doesn't make any sense.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.808
These doors haven't
been opened in weeks.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.447
Were those claw
marks always there?

34:58.840 --> 34:59.841
Do you think it...

35:03.680 --> 35:05.569
Oh, God.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.370
She has an
implant in her back.

35:07.440 --> 35:10.125
I can track it
from the control room.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.564
We have an asset
out of containment.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.326
Put ACU on alert.
This is not a drill.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.131
LOWERY: Even though I didn't
meet him until I was 13,

35:27.280 --> 35:28.884
I definitely consider Carl to be

35:28.960 --> 35:30.485
more of a dad
than my real dad.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.766
(BEEPING)

35:33.160 --> 35:34.161

35:35.440 --> 35:37.329

CLAIRE: <i>Lowery.</i>

35:37.480 --> 35:39.164
Get me coordinates
on the <i>Indominus.</i>

35:40.560 --> 35:41.607
Okay, yeah.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.246
I'm doing it right now.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.368
GUARD: That wall
is 40 feet high.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.325
Do you really think
she could have climbed out?

36:13.440 --> 36:15.363
It depends.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.726
On what?

36:17.240 --> 36:20.244
What kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.082
LOWERY: Wait, what the hell?
(BEEPING)

36:24.280 --> 36:25.930
It's in the cage.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.282
No, that's impossible.
I was just there.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.249
Claire, I'm telling you,
she's in the cage.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.403
Wait a sec.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.891
There are people in there.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.961
(GASPS)

36:36.960 --> 36:38.803
Get them out of there now.

36:38.880 --> 36:39.881
Now!

36:39.960 --> 36:43.089
Paddock 11, this is Control.
You need to evacuate the containment area.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.482
Everyone remain calm.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.407
The implant will shock it
if it gets too close to a perimeter fence.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.090
Okay. It's moving
really fast.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.003
This is Control.
Put out a park-wide alert.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.128
Hang up that
damn phone, please.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.441
Sorry, I'm getting new information.
Everything's fine.

40:04.520 --> 40:07.000
Let Asset Containment
capture it quietly.

40:07.120 --> 40:10.442
The very existence of this park is
predicated on our ability

40:10.520 --> 40:12.329
to handle incidents like this.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.249
It was an eventuality, okay?

40:14.320 --> 40:16.084
You should put
that in the brochure.

40:16.160 --> 40:19.607
"Eventually, one of these
things will eat somebody."

40:19.680 --> 40:23.048
That paddock is four miles
from the closest attraction.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.641
ACU can handle this.
No one else is gonna get...

I rescued a wolf pup.

My wife, she came at
me with a steak knife.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.525
It took a chunk
out of her arm.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.127
Did you put him down?

41:25.520 --> 41:26.965
Hell, no.

We had an unshakeable

If Mom and Dad get divorced,

42:49.160 --> 42:51.162
will one of us be with Mom

What? Why would
you say that?

Look. You haven't been around long enough.
They've always been that way.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.164
They get mail from
two different lawyers.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.009
That doesn't mean anything.

43:06.080 --> 43:07.923

They're divorce lawyers.

You know what?
It doesn't matter, okay?

I'm gonna be gone
in two years anyway.
