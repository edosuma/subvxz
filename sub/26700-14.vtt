00:00.626 --> 00:02.169
Previously on Legacies...
HOPE: He’s been wondering

00:02.169 --> 00:03.587
about his mother
his whole life.

00:03.587 --> 00:05.297
You’re my son,
all right.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.299
HOPE:
He finally meets her
and then she dies?

00:07.299 --> 00:08.967
ALARIC:
Literal pit of doom.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.053
That consumes creatures
and wipes their existence

00:11.053 --> 00:12.304
from the collective conscience.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.597
What do you think she’s like?

00:13.597 --> 00:14.598
ALARIC:
Are you sure you want to keep

00:14.598 --> 00:15.641
all this from Landon?

00:15.641 --> 00:16.934
If I can keep him from knowing

00:16.934 --> 00:17.809
what that feels like,

00:17.809 --> 00:19.686
then it’s my secret to keep.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.896
LIZZIE:
What did I ever do

00:20.896 --> 00:22.564
to make you hate me so much?

00:22.564 --> 00:24.149
It’s about how you treat Josie.

00:24.149 --> 00:27.069
She spends all of her energy
taking care of you.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.987
But she won’t ever
burn your world down.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.989
So I will do it for her.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.741
MG! MG.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.951
Just tell me what happened.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.702
MG:
He didn’t want me anymore.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.703
I’m a vampire.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.247
You’re a demon.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.082
MG:
He was right
to be afraid of me.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.458
Not after what I did.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.710
(MG snarls)

00:43.710 --> 00:45.963
(sobbing)

00:45.963 --> 00:47.839
Uh... you got to see this.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.802
ALARIC:
We’ve been wondering
if he’s supernatural.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.262
We have our answer.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.264
You ever heard
of the legend of the Phoenix?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.273
So we’re clear, then.

01:04.273 --> 01:06.817
You’ll bring me
what I want...

01:06.817 --> 01:08.902
by any means necessary.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.950
I need some indication
that you agree.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.619
Or else I withdraw
my very generous offer

01:17.619 --> 01:19.496
and I toss you in...

01:19.496 --> 01:20.706
right now.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.292
Will you do it?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.588
I need an unmarked vehicle
with an armed

01:28.588 --> 01:30.966
plainclothes driver
to transport an asset.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.259
It’s high priority.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.760
MAN (over radio):
Copy that, Agent Clarke.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.761
Destination?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.638
Mystic Falls, Virginia.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.473
The Salvatore School.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.368
(gasps softly)

01:58.368 --> 02:00.329
(whimpering)

02:04.583 --> 02:05.876
(whimpers)

02:05.876 --> 02:07.711
Hope, wake up.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.463
Hope, wake up.
(yells)

02:14.134 --> 02:15.761
(gasps)

02:15.761 --> 02:17.346
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.347
Landon, are you okay?

02:18.347 --> 02:19.598
(coughs)
Well,

02:19.598 --> 02:21.808
I was recently dead,
so I think I’ll mend.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.976
What happened?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.561
You were having a nightmare.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.771
And then you screamed

02:25.771 --> 02:27.230
and some magical wave thing
hit me,

02:27.230 --> 02:29.232
and now I have art supplies
where no man should.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.867
Hey, Dr. Saltzman,
uh, can we talk?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.077
Yeah, of course.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.162
I was just doing
some Phoenix research.

02:42.162 --> 02:42.996
Please sit down.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.331
Um, yeah, well, I mean,

02:44.331 --> 02:46.541
obviously I’m dying
to know m-more, uh,

02:46.541 --> 02:48.043
pard-pardon the pun.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.127
(chuckles)
Uh, but actually,

02:49.127 --> 02:50.504
I wanted to talk to you about...

02:50.504 --> 02:52.172
MG? Is he still acting weird?

02:52.172 --> 02:55.092
Look, once Emma’s done with
her therapy intensive with Raf,

02:55.092 --> 02:57.552
she’ll work with MG--
and she’ll work with you, too,

02:57.552 --> 02:58.970
if you want to deal
with the fallout

02:58.970 --> 03:00.222
of him, you know...

03:01.139 --> 03:03.350
...killing you.
(chuckles)

03:03.350 --> 03:06.603
Dr. Saltzman, I’m honestly
just glad to know what I am.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.772
And that I belong
at this school.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.858
Good. You, uh...

03:13.026 --> 03:14.403
...got a little...

03:16.363 --> 03:18.865
Yeah, that was actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

03:18.865 --> 03:19.866
Paint?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.535
Hope.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.415
So, what’s wrong with you?

03:26.415 --> 03:27.499
Nothing, I’m fine.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.959
(both panting)

03:28.959 --> 03:31.253
Landon told me
about your little incident.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.713
Isn’t boyfriend confidentiality
a thing?

03:33.713 --> 03:34.881
It should be.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.261
He’s just worried
about you, that’s all.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.512
He doesn’t need to be.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.805
(grunting)

03:43.598 --> 03:44.599
Are you sure?

03:44.599 --> 03:45.600
It seems like you’re manifesting

03:45.600 --> 03:47.894
a little stress and anxiety.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.104
My guess is,
you’re still dealing

03:49.104 --> 03:51.481
with the trauma
of seeing Landon dead.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.899
(Hope grunts)

03:52.899 --> 03:54.860
(grunting)

03:54.860 --> 03:57.237
(exhales)
I’ve been through worse.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.491
(grunts)

04:01.491 --> 04:03.243
I mean, with your family
history, I just want

04:03.243 --> 04:04.911
to make sure...
I said I’m fine!

04:07.831 --> 04:10.459
(groans)
Okay.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.628
I-I could stand to blow off
some steam. I’m gonna...

04:13.628 --> 04:16.548
go check the woods to see
if I can wolf out.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.426
(groans)
(door opens)

04:19.426 --> 04:20.427
(door closes)

04:20.427 --> 04:21.845
Daddy, I need you.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.598
(groans)

04:24.598 --> 04:27.517
They won’t unload the trucks
without your signature.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.685
What?

04:28.685 --> 04:31.438
Tables, chairs, flowers,
and a...

04:31.438 --> 04:32.856
helium tank?

04:32.856 --> 04:34.024
Who ordered all this?

04:34.024 --> 04:36.151
You did. A few months ago.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.528
Why?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.573
(gasps)

04:41.573 --> 04:42.908
ALARIC:
I have some news.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.868
Many of you, like me,

04:44.868 --> 04:46.953
have forgotten
that we are hosting

04:46.953 --> 04:49.539
this year’s
Miss Mystic Falls Pageant.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.875
(students muttering, groaning)
Trust me, I know.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.169
But the rotation
is set in stone.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.213
So, let’s take the opportunity

04:56.213 --> 04:58.882
to maintain our image
as a normal school

04:58.882 --> 05:00.884
for the rich and awful.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.385
As usual,

05:02.385 --> 05:06.348
anything remotely magical,
enchanted,

05:06.348 --> 05:09.392
vampire, wolf or witch-related

05:09.392 --> 05:12.062
must be kept tucked away,
hidden,

05:12.062 --> 05:13.772
and under lock and key.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.065
Now...

05:15.065 --> 05:17.692
with your chore assignments.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.612
Okay, so we’ll split into teams.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.615
(gurgling)

05:27.953 --> 05:29.412
Hey, Hope.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.289
You have any idea
where these guys go?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.999
Yeah, anywhere but
with the birds.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.376
The ravens and the finches
are fine,

05:34.376 --> 05:36.586
but the rats
drive the owls crazy.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.714
So I’ve been thinking about why
you’ve been acting so weird.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.133
Suddenly everyone’s got
a psychology degree around here.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.678
No, I just, I just think
you have cold feet.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.804
About what?

05:45.804 --> 05:47.055
Us.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.474
You know, we’re good.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.142
We’re finally
in a solid relationship

05:51.142 --> 05:53.770
based on honesty
and openness and...

05:53.770 --> 05:55.230
I’m indestructible.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.274
You’re relatively
indestructible.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.942
We finally have a long,
clear road ahead of us,

05:58.942 --> 06:00.318
you know, with no obstacles.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.120
Who is that?

06:10.996 --> 06:12.831
Um...

06:12.831 --> 06:14.958
That is Roman.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.335
My ex-boyfriend.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.337
Oh.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.632
All right, thank you.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.721
Veronica.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.681
I didn’t expect
to see you again so soon.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.225
Well, I’m here
to discuss my son.
Oh, great.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.352
Uh, well, uh, as I
told you when I called,

06:34.352 --> 06:37.022
we have a good handle
on MG’s therapy.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.106
We have an
excellent counselor.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.524
He killed a fellow classmate.

06:39.524 --> 06:44.195
Who, thankfully, resurrected
and harbors no ill will.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.114
When you recruited Milton,
you didn’t mention

06:46.114 --> 06:48.116
anything about monsters,
much less him having

06:48.116 --> 06:49.784
a Phoenix as a classmate.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.871
It’s, uh, a recent development.

06:52.871 --> 06:56.124
But I assure you, we remain
committed to MG’s care.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.043
He’s such a good kid
with a big heart.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.128
I know this. I raised him.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.212
But when
he left my home,

07:01.212 --> 07:02.714
he was not a murderer.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.426
Dr. Saltzman’s been
a little overwhelmed,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.470
so, uh, I’ve been doing
a little...

07:08.470 --> 07:10.305
recruiting recon
for him lately.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.557
But he asked me to come in
today and lend a hand.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.144
Oh, uh, this is Landon.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.562
Her boyfriend.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.774
And a Phoenix.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.026
By the way, which is...

07:23.026 --> 07:25.195
so cool.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.159
I better go find Dr. Saltzman.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.789
That was a little
alpha male of you.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.500
I mean, is that
the 90-year-old vampire ex

07:38.500 --> 07:40.710
you may have mentioned
murdered your mom?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.212
It is.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.880
Though I don’t hold him
responsible

07:43.880 --> 07:45.340
for what happened anymore.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.302
I’m gonna go
hide more rats.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.644
Hey.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.437
How about we blow
this popsicle stand

07:59.437 --> 08:01.773
and go to my room for a little
binge-watch and chill?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.024
You and I only make out

08:03.024 --> 08:05.110
when magical slugs
invade our brains.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.737
I actually want to talk to you
about the letter I wrote.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.450
Which I’m guessing
you haven’t read yet.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.744
Been dealing with the pageant,
Penelope.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.122
Yeah, I can see that.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.581
See, this is me
offering you

08:18.581 --> 08:20.208
a viable option out.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.295
This pageant is
misogynistic and archaic.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.630
Stop enabling it.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.715
I can’t.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.091
I’m a contestant.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.343
You know, I wish I was
drinking something right now

08:30.343 --> 08:31.636
so I could do a spit take.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.847
You know my mom
was Miss Mystic Falls?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.432
Lizzie’s been dreaming
of this day

08:35.432 --> 08:36.725
since she was little.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.643
Things have been rocky
between us recently,

08:38.643 --> 08:41.896
so if me throwing a few events
helps her win the title,

08:41.896 --> 08:43.314
I’m all for it.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.233
You agreed to help Lizzie win?

08:45.233 --> 08:46.526
I’m supporting my sister.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.363
It’s her crown
and I’m fine with that.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.782
HOPE:
I need another task.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.951
Something more strenuous
if you have it.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.371
Does this have anything to do
with the return of Roman Sienna?

08:58.371 --> 09:01.124
Because I can think
of something real strenuous.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.959
It’s not about Roman.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.627
I just need a release.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.255
With all these humans coming
to campus, I can’t wolf out.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.549
Okay, I’ll make you a list.
(gasps)

09:11.551 --> 09:13.553
The judges are here. Excuse me.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.598
Mrs. Thompson.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.350
It is such a pleasure
to see you again.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.561
I have your tea waiting
for you in the Great Room.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.314
Earl Grey, milk, two sugars.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.732
Dr. Brandt.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.736
I was so sad
to hear about Muffin.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.404
She was a fine dog.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.324
WOMAN:
Lizzie Saltzman?

09:34.324 --> 09:36.910
Vera Lilien.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.540
Dana’s mom.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.625
Oh...

09:43.625 --> 09:46.377
My dearest Dana told me so much

09:46.377 --> 09:48.421
about you before she passed.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.132
All good things, I hope.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.426
(giggles)
Not remotely.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.974
I am withdrawing
from Miss Mystic Falls.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.101
Effective immediately.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.271
I thought you had something
important to tell us.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.106
Come for the underwhelming
announcement,

10:07.106 --> 10:08.566
stay for the epic meltdown.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.901
Okay, wait,
why are you quitting?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.945
A personal issue
with one of the judges.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.990
A direct result
of that bitch Dana’s sabotage.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.325
She’s dead, Lizzie.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.660
Correction:

10:18.660 --> 10:21.538
that dead bitch Dana’s sabotage.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.457
Costing me the crown
from beyond the grave.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.168
The head judge is her mother.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.628
The town pharmacist.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.130
There is always
next year for me.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.674
But that does not mean
that we here

10:32.674 --> 10:35.510
at the Salvatore School
shouldn’t bring home the title

10:35.510 --> 10:37.804
and stick it
to those townies.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.764
So, I have studied

10:39.764 --> 10:41.474
all of the stats
and advanced metrics,

10:41.474 --> 10:45.061
and I have chosen
a replacement.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.814
Hope Mikaelson.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.867
I’m gonna regret this, aren’t I?

10:58.867 --> 11:01.202
Regret it?
You are the perfect candidate.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.163
You are pageant-pretty,
reasonably well-spoken,

11:04.163 --> 11:06.749
and not to mention you have the
added bonus of being an orphan.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.001
Classic charity case.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.962
Plus, you wanted strenuous.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.548
This is the fiercest competition
in the land.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.924
(sighs):
Okay...

11:14.924 --> 11:17.135
My mother’s research.
She used it to prepare

11:17.135 --> 11:19.345
for Miss Mystic Falls
the year that she won.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.181
It’s effective,
but her methods?

11:22.181 --> 11:25.059
Quaint at best.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.111
This is my research.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.156
I have studied

11:38.156 --> 11:40.825
every answer given, why
every winner has won,

11:40.825 --> 11:42.952
and why every loser has lost.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.830
No one from the Salvatore School
has ever come close.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.125
Until today.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.589
What’s up, killer?

11:54.589 --> 11:55.882
(soft thud)

12:03.389 --> 12:04.807
Hi.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.143
Hi.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.438
Visiting contestants’ changing
rooms are down that way.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.607
Okay. Thanks.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.484
Do you like comics?

12:15.652 --> 12:17.070
The Green Lantern?

12:19.781 --> 12:21.574
He’s only my favorite.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.826
(both chuckle)

12:23.826 --> 12:25.161
I’m Nia.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.080
MG.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.709
If you want, I could show you
around the school.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.169
Okay.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.212
(laughs):
Yeah? Okay, solid.

12:34.212 --> 12:37.048
Uh, welcome to Salvatore School.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.926
(sighs)

12:39.926 --> 12:42.220
They call it rehearsal,
but make no mistake:

12:42.220 --> 12:44.389
the competition starts now.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.065
(sighs)

12:54.065 --> 12:55.984
What are you
doing here?

12:55.984 --> 12:58.277
Isn’t your presence alone
a huge win for the patriarchy?

12:58.277 --> 13:00.613
Mm, not if I’m your escort.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.573
MG is my escort.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.159
Well, I might have convinced him
to sit this one out.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.953
And why would you do that?

13:06.953 --> 13:09.372
If you read the letter,
you’d know.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.165
(thudding)
(Vera clears throat)

13:11.165 --> 13:13.418
Time for rehearsal. Mm-hmm?

13:13.418 --> 13:16.254
(strings playing
Lady Gaga’s "Just Dance")

13:20.591 --> 13:22.260
Honor your partner.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.806
Right hand around.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.560
Flirt with your eyes.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.271
Left hand around.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.607
Both hands.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.280
(scoffs)

13:42.280 --> 13:43.948
I’m sorry.
Sorry.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.284
With the time you spent
not doing your hair,

13:46.284 --> 13:48.536
you could’ve at least
practiced the dance a little.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.955
(sighs)

13:52.957 --> 13:55.460
This is the death of feminism.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.128
It’s tradition.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.047
Don’t be a hater.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.968
I’m gonna trip now.
What?

14:06.888 --> 14:08.931
Ooh! Very nice.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.141
But there’s no touching

14:10.141 --> 14:11.476
during this part.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.603
It’s all about
the simple intimacy

14:13.603 --> 14:15.605
of the near-touch.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.110
Don’t ruin this for me.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.029
For you or for Lizzie?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.530
For both of us.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.656
There’s a plan.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.700
That plan now involves
helping Hope.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.453
I already told you
I don’t want to win.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.497
But did you mean it?

14:32.497 --> 14:35.333
Or would following in your
mother’s footsteps be cooler

14:35.333 --> 14:37.335
than you could ever imagine?

14:37.335 --> 14:39.295
Would winning Miss Mystic Falls
bring your family history

14:39.295 --> 14:41.672
full-circle in a way
that Lizzie...

14:43.091 --> 14:44.258
...would never appreciate?

14:44.258 --> 14:46.177
Why would you say that?

14:46.177 --> 14:48.971
Let’s just finish the dance.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.350
NIA:
Like there’s a question?

14:52.350 --> 14:56.062
John Stewart is the best
Green Lantern by a mile.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.688
Not even close.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.775
But that Hal Jordan story
is for real, though.

15:00.775 --> 15:04.153
I mean, dude kills
his friends

15:04.153 --> 15:05.988
and still redeems himself.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.241
If he can make good on that,

15:08.241 --> 15:10.743
then there’s hope
for all of us, right?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.745
That’s deep.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.705
You kind of caught me
at a deep moment.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.042
So, this is the third time
we’ve been through this room

15:18.042 --> 15:21.129
and you still haven’t introduced
me to anyone else around here,

15:21.129 --> 15:22.505
like your friends.

15:22.505 --> 15:26.092
But maybe later,
I’ll introduce you to...

15:27.760 --> 15:29.303
...my mom?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.724
Young lady, do you have
something else to do?

15:36.060 --> 15:38.563
Yeah, I guess I do.

15:38.563 --> 15:39.564
I’m sorry.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.778
Milton, we have to talk.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.449
(strings playing)

15:50.449 --> 15:52.785
I can’t believe you
were so nice to him.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.787
After everything you told me he
did to you and to your family,

15:54.787 --> 15:56.831
you can act like
nothing happened?
It’s complicated.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.417
He spent half of his life
desiccated in a cave.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.794
And then he was
brainwashed by his mother,

16:01.794 --> 16:05.256
who was a literal Nazi.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.757
And he’s spent
the last two years

16:06.757 --> 16:09.135
doing really good
work for the school.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.303
Your mother is still dead.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.971
How does any of that
exonerate him?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.222
It doesn’t.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.600
But it’s in the past. Leave it.

16:15.600 --> 16:19.145
LANDON:
I suffered through how much
torture because I stole a knife,

16:19.145 --> 16:21.731
and this guy has a hand
in the death of your...
Landon,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.316
stop.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.986
Come with me.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.989
You, stay here.
Do nothing.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.659
VERONICA:
I don’t think this school is a
very good fit for you anymore.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.995
What? They’re taking
good care of me here.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.331
Plus, it’s not like you’re
willing to take me home.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.292
There are other schools overseas
for people like you...

16:41.292 --> 16:43.169
I don’t want any other school.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.212
And I honestly
don’t need

16:44.212 --> 16:45.880
you judging this one, either.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.217
At least here they see me for
who I am, ugly parts and all.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.178
So maybe you
should go home

16:52.178 --> 16:54.680
and leave me be.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.561
(indistinct chatter)

17:00.561 --> 17:02.813
Lizzie, where are we going?
You are a ticking time bomb.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.607
I’m gonna show you how
to take care of it

17:04.607 --> 17:07.735
before you hurt someone, or
worse, cost us the pageant.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.946
I’m fine. Okay?
I just needed some air...

17:09.946 --> 17:12.073
You are far from fine.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.952
You are one small moment away
from a meltdown, trust me.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.119
I know the signs.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.537
You know that feeling inside,

17:18.537 --> 17:20.998
like a balloon
constantly filling up,

17:20.998 --> 17:22.750
always on the verge of popping?

17:22.750 --> 17:23.751
Maybe.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.835
Well, let it pop.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.674
Scream as loud as you can.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.895
(screaming)

17:53.114 --> 17:55.241
(birds chirping)

17:56.576 --> 17:59.453
(panting): You know?
I actually feel a lot better.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.455
But I think I need
to go back up to my room.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.748
I need to call it a day.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.792
No, you are not
dropping out on me.

18:04.792 --> 18:09.505
If I’m right, which I am, our
win probability is still at 87%.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.008
Even after that
abysmal rehearsal.

18:12.008 --> 18:15.511
So buckle up, we’re in
this till the bitter end.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.682
In a situation like this,

18:19.682 --> 18:21.934
which one of us
is supposed to apologize?

18:21.934 --> 18:26.439
When it comes to jealousy?
Always the guy.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.065
Hey.
Hey.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.944
I’m so sorry, I was totally
insensitive, and I just, I...

18:31.944 --> 18:34.238
Where did this statue come from?

18:34.238 --> 18:35.906
Uh, I-I don’t know,

18:35.906 --> 18:38.159
somebody probably moved it up
here when they were cleaning?

18:38.159 --> 18:40.619
Looks like one of the
statues from the basement.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.664
Call me crazy, but doesn’t
this look like MG’s mom?

18:47.418 --> 18:50.463
I think it is MG’s mom.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.301
MG:
Who would do this
to my mom?

18:55.301 --> 18:57.386
Well, not just who would--
who could?

18:57.386 --> 18:59.388
It could be a bad
spell translation,

18:59.388 --> 19:01.557
a potion mishap?
Or a monster.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.142
There’s no reason
a monster would be here.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.311
Unless this sentient jar

19:05.311 --> 19:08.689
of artisanal mayonnaise
activated a new artifact.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.025
What did you touch?
Everything.

19:11.025 --> 19:14.445
We cleaned the school
from top to bottom, remember?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.364
But if we’re just gonna throw
out wild theories, here’s one:

19:16.364 --> 19:18.741
what if the person
who did this showed up today,

19:18.741 --> 19:20.326
out of nowhere,
acting all buddy-buddy,

19:20.326 --> 19:23.621
manipulating romantic feelings
to get someone’s guard down?

19:23.621 --> 19:25.373
Do you seriously suspect Roman?

19:25.373 --> 19:27.375
Yeah, we all should.
The timing is too convenient.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.377
I thought you were sorry
for acting jealous.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.462
I was sorry,
but now I’m vindicated.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.963
All right, Lizzie, Hope,

19:32.963 --> 19:34.215
you keep an eye on
the contestants.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.800
MG, we’re gonna
search the campus.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.135
Landon...
I’m gonna go ask
Roman some questions.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.637
Yeah, super helpful.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.722
Ask a vampire how he turned
a woman to stone.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.433
All right, everyone stay alert
and be careful out there.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.898
LANDON:
So this has got to be weird
for you.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.734
Lot of emotions coming up, been
a while since you’ve seen Hope.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.903
I thought we were supposed to be
looking for the boulder bandit.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.196
Yeah, about that.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.658
Are you sure
I’m not looking at him?

20:00.658 --> 20:01.992
(scoffs)

20:01.992 --> 20:04.370
Uh, yeah.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.081
Yeah, you solved
the case, Sherlock.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.707
I’m gonna turn
the entire school to stone,

20:08.707 --> 20:10.251
steal a horse from the stable,

20:10.251 --> 20:13.087
and Hope and I are gonna
ride off into the sunset.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.422
Stop beating
around the bush.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.590
Ask me what you really
want to know.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.970
Do I still have
feelings for Hope?

20:22.138 --> 20:24.890
Yes, of course I do,
and I always will,

20:24.890 --> 20:26.809
but she would
never get back with me.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.936
And, look, you don’t have
to trust me on this,

20:28.936 --> 20:31.939
but you should
definitely trust her.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.113
HOPE:
"Though I still struggle daily

20:39.113 --> 20:42.533
with a profound sense
of l-loss..."

20:42.533 --> 20:45.703
Lizzie, um, why
are all the answers

20:45.703 --> 20:49.123
that you’ve prepared for me
about death and grief?

20:49.123 --> 20:51.041
The Q and A portion
of Miss Mystic Falls

20:51.041 --> 20:53.127
isn’t just about
A-ing the Qs, Hope.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.171
You and Dana’s mom
have a lot in common.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.423
She lost Dana,
you lost

20:57.423 --> 21:00.968
your mom, your dad,
Landon almost.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.971
(scoffs) I’m not...
I’m not struggling anymore.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.056
I’ve dealt with it and moved on.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.734
This was my mother’s.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.652
We can alter it to fit you.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.327
It’s gorgeous.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.583
How’d the interview
portion go?
Great. Totally blew it.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.834
Hey, hey.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.503
I think
we should talk

21:35.503 --> 21:37.671
about how you
really feel about this.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.006
Okay, sure.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.760
Or maybe I could just

21:42.760 --> 21:44.261
write it all down with this.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.305
I was wondering
how you quoted

21:46.305 --> 21:48.140
my exact thoughts
on Miss Mystic Falls,

21:48.140 --> 21:49.558
word for word.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.853
Then I remembered
I wrote it all in my diary,

21:52.853 --> 21:55.314
using one of the pens
you gave everyone for Christmas.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.067
You spelled it.
You’re using it to spy.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.443
I siphoned one.

21:59.443 --> 22:03.113
There’s enough magic in it
to levitate an elephant.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.534
You caught me.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.868
Yeah, I’ve been reading
your journal.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.162
I’ve been reading
everyone’s journal,

22:10.162 --> 22:12.289
but I am only using

22:12.289 --> 22:14.166
the information for good,

22:14.166 --> 22:17.086
like convincing you
to win Miss Mystic Falls.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.004
Even if I hadn’t
already tanked it,

22:19.004 --> 22:20.673
I don’t want to win,

22:20.673 --> 22:22.383
because then
I’d be beating Hope,

22:22.383 --> 22:23.884
and Lizzie wants Hope to win.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.012
So all of your selfish,
obnoxious and evil meddling

22:27.012 --> 22:28.722
was for nothing.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.275
If it’s a monster,

22:39.275 --> 22:41.277
my guess is
it’s a Gorgon.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.653
What’s that?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.446
You ever hear of Medusa?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.700
She’s the most
famous one.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.703
They’re supposed to be
incredibly beautiful

22:50.703 --> 22:52.329
with snakes
for hair,

22:52.329 --> 22:54.415
turn men into stone.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.834
If Dorian were here,
he could tell you more about it,

22:56.834 --> 22:58.586
but he’s not.

22:58.586 --> 23:02.131
Uh... wh-what if she was
doing it off of instinct?

23:02.131 --> 23:03.966
You know, Gorgons gonna Gorgon.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.968
Maybe it was a mistake.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.637
Maybe she’s actually
super smart

23:08.637 --> 23:10.055
and-and-and chill

23:10.055 --> 23:13.809
and she’s just scared
or confused or something. Maybe.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.729
What do you know?

23:30.868 --> 23:33.287
Where is
Landon Kirby?

23:33.287 --> 23:37.249
I won’t hurt you
or anyone else

23:37.249 --> 23:39.460
if you just take me
to Landon Kirby.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.003
I’m not giving up
any of my friends,

23:41.003 --> 23:43.172
but I’m definitely
not giving up Landon.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.517
Why aren’t you stone?

23:55.517 --> 23:59.188
I don’t know.
Maybe because I’m a vampire?

23:59.188 --> 24:02.316
You’re a vamp?

24:04.151 --> 24:06.153
That’s dope.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.529
(chuckles)

24:07.529 --> 24:08.906
Two things:

24:08.906 --> 24:10.366
Stewart is the best.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.201
Whatever. And?

24:12.201 --> 24:15.496
And... I’m sorry.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.290
(bones crack)

24:33.305 --> 24:35.307
Mmm.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.059
It’s not bad.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.022
I don’t think you’ve ever
spoken to me before.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.775
You’ve never had
free booze before.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.944
Right. Makes sense.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.780
So, what sorrows
are we drowning?

24:55.828 --> 24:58.747
I came back
from the dead...

24:59.915 --> 25:03.168
...in a, in a
burst of flames.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.169
And you’d think

25:04.169 --> 25:06.380
that would earn a guy a couple
days of feeling special,

25:06.380 --> 25:09.675
but the irony about
this place is that...

25:09.675 --> 25:11.343
special is just normal.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.138
All it takes is one
good-looking vampire,

25:14.138 --> 25:16.140
and then I might as well be
back at Mystic Falls High.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.891
(sighs) Maybe
I should just...

25:17.891 --> 25:19.101
tell Hope how jealous I am

25:19.101 --> 25:22.020
of Vampire Captain America.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.232
I should put it all out there,
right? And just say it.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.317
If I’ve learned
anything from Hope,

25:27.317 --> 25:29.445
it’s that honesty
is the best policy.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.988
(spits)

25:30.988 --> 25:34.408
(laughs)
I’m sorry.

25:34.408 --> 25:35.993
Did you just
put "Hope"

25:35.993 --> 25:38.162
and "honesty"
in the same sentence?

25:39.496 --> 25:42.750
You are all so blind
to the hypocrisy of this place.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.211

30:03.760 --> 30:06.138

I could on Gorgons,

30:06.138 --> 30:08.390

in one book

30:08.390 --> 30:10.142

(heart beating rapidly)

33:49.152 --> 33:51.238
Congratulations.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.822
It’s okay.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.116

34:25.689 --> 34:28.858
I was basically off the grid.
Just me and my family.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.986
No neighbors, no friends.

34:30.986 --> 34:32.946
We only went to town
for the necessities.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.489
Then one day,

34:34.489 --> 34:38.034
men from some place called
Triad Industries showed up.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.286
They had guns.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.662
They said they would
kill me and, like,

34:40.662 --> 34:42.080
erase me from memory
if I didn’t come here

34:42.080 --> 34:43.540
and do what they asked.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.293
I understand why you had
to do it, but what about my mom?

34:46.293 --> 34:48.295
I saw the way she talked to you.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.046
Honestly, she deserved it.

34:51.965 --> 34:54.384
I am in so much trouble,
aren’t I?

34:54.384 --> 34:56.636
Listen, Nia,

34:56.636 --> 34:58.722
here, it’s not about

34:58.722 --> 35:03.935
how bad you mess up, it’s about
if you make up for it.

35:05.353 --> 35:08.231
You can start by undoing
the damage you’ve caused.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.400
I need to go find Landon.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.737
Just give him
a minute to breathe.

35:13.737 --> 35:18.950
Boys need some space
before they come crawling back.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.370
I thought I could keep
it all together.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.955
I’ve worked so hard to move on

35:23.955 --> 35:26.583
from all the things that have
happened to me in my life.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.543
But everyone
was right.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.964
Everyone’s been right.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.300
I needed to, like,
let it all out.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.179
How did you know what to say?

35:39.179 --> 35:41.431
How’d you know
what to do?

35:41.431 --> 35:45.018
It’s just what Josie’s done
for me a thousand times.

35:46.269 --> 35:50.106
She’s really mad at me.

35:50.106 --> 35:53.610
I don’t think I’ve ever
seen her so angry.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.947
(quietly):
Landon’s pretty mad at me, too.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.825
Then let’s
make a deal.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.744
You help me get Josie back,

36:02.744 --> 36:05.413
and I’ll help you
get Landon.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.258
(sighs)

36:18.093 --> 36:20.178
Did you know?

36:23.014 --> 36:24.682
After the day I’ve had,

36:24.682 --> 36:27.143
I’m gonna need you to be
a little more specific, Landon.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.521
I was a lawn ornament
until about ten minutes ago.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.440
Did you know that Hope
remembered meeting my mom?

36:34.442 --> 36:37.696
Did you know that she was
lying to me about it?

36:39.114 --> 36:41.241
Yeah, I did.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.080
So you’re a liar, too.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.918
If you’re looking
for someone to blame,

36:51.918 --> 36:53.711
go ahead, you can blame me.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.672
I can take it.

36:55.672 --> 36:59.008
But just cut Hope
a little slack, okay?

37:00.844 --> 37:02.345
She just wanted to protect you.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.514
(crying):
Protect me?

37:06.391 --> 37:09.477
I can’t deal with this
right now.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.188
MG:
How you feeling?

37:12.188 --> 37:15.108
Much lighter, thank you.

37:15.108 --> 37:16.609
Look, Ma,

37:16.609 --> 37:18.611
I’m sorry for snapping
at you earlier.

37:18.611 --> 37:21.156
You didn’t raise me to talk
to grown folks like that.

37:21.156 --> 37:25.160
But you did raise me
to be my own man

37:25.160 --> 37:27.078
and to make
my own choices.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.079
(sighs)

37:28.079 --> 37:29.372
I have friends here.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.542
Uh, Dr. Saltzman
has my back.

37:32.542 --> 37:36.337
This is the only place that
would give me a second chance

37:36.337 --> 37:38.089
after doing what I did.
Milton...

37:38.089 --> 37:40.216
I don’t like
being called that.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.969
And the only way I am leaving
this place is dead,

37:42.969 --> 37:44.846
with a stake in my heart.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.766
Or when I graduate.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.895
Hopefully, it’s when I graduate.

one reason to stay.

38:37.857 --> 38:41.861
Instead, you gave me a
