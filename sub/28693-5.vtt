00:05.049 --> 00:06.049
Previously on.

00:05.209 --> 00:06.209
"The InBetween"...

00:07.150 --> 00:08.350
Cassie has certain abilities

00:08.351 --> 00:09.388
that can be very helpful.

00:09.389 --> 00:10.999
She's still alive.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.119
- Medic!
- Over here!

00:12.120 --> 00:13.119
What she sees...

00:13.119 --> 00:14.070
Run!

00:14.071 --> 00:15.231
Is incredibly rough on her.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.120
I see ghosts.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.169
Abigail!

00:21.170 --> 00:22.210
You're just like my mom.

00:22.234 --> 00:24.159
You don't care about me.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.685
Sometimes they

00:25.686 --> 00:27.209
send me a message.

00:27.210 --> 00:29.030
- And sometimes.
- They just show up.

00:29.033 --> 00:30.088
This stuff only happens

00:30.089 --> 00:31.555
when the universe

00:31.556 --> 00:33.020
wants it to happen.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.690

02:18.199 --> 02:21.078
Yeah.

02:21.079 --> 02:23.039
- Tom, it's me.
- Hey.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.078
I'm having a weird morning.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.069
- Well, I'm at.
- A drive-by shooting,

02:27.072 --> 02:29.109
So the gunfire tracks,

02:29.110 --> 02:31.055
but no horned monsters,

02:31.056 --> 02:32.999
scary trees, or crying babies,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.038
not yet, anyway.

02:34.039 --> 02:35.218
Listen, I got to go.

02:35.219 --> 02:37.188
I'll talk to you later.

02:37.189 --> 02:39.634
Dispatch said shots fired.

02:39.635 --> 02:42.078
Mia Fuentes was hit.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.000
- She's running.
- For City Council...

02:44.003 --> 02:46.000
Young, Latina, - lot of fans.

02:46.003 --> 02:47.188
And at least one enemy.

02:47.189 --> 02:48.640
She and her team were leaving

02:48.641 --> 02:50.089
a campaign fund-raiser.

02:50.090 --> 02:52.009
- They came through.
- This back door.

02:52.010 --> 02:53.050
Witnesses say that someone

02:53.074 --> 02:55.009
- started shooting.
- From a motorcycle.

02:55.012 --> 02:56.610
Edwin Bernal,

02:56.611 --> 02:58.209
the campaign manager.

02:58.210 --> 03:00.198
Fuentes is on her way to ER.

03:00.199 --> 03:02.179
A lone gunman on a motorcycle

03:02.180 --> 03:04.158
says hit job to me.

03:04.159 --> 03:06.999
Maybe a street gang?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.025
Well, Fuentes

03:08.026 --> 03:09.049
has been very vocal

03:09.050 --> 03:11.009
- about cracking down.
- On local crime.

03:11.012 --> 03:12.060
Yeah, but isn't everyone

03:12.061 --> 03:13.109
who's running for office?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.050
- Why her? Why now?
- Good questions.

03:15.053 --> 03:16.119
And what about this?

03:16.120 --> 03:18.090
- If the shooter.
- Was waiting in the alley,

03:18.093 --> 03:20.129
- That means.
- He must have known the team.

03:20.132 --> 03:21.159
Would be using

03:21.160 --> 03:22.188
the back door.

03:22.189 --> 03:25.049
Someone tipped him off.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.198
Let's go visit Fuentes.

03:26.199 --> 03:27.205
[indistinct chatter

03:30.180 --> 03:32.090
- A monster?
- Yes.

03:32.093 --> 03:34.138
Some sort of horned creature

03:34.139 --> 03:36.120
- and a scary tree.
- With no leaves.

03:36.123 --> 03:38.009
- Well, Seattle's.
- Full of trees.

03:38.012 --> 03:40.039
- Well, let's just sit on it,
- shall we?

03:40.042 --> 03:41.179
Mr. Fuentes?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.640
Detectives Asante and Hackett,

03:42.641 --> 03:44.098
Seattle PD.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.099
Any word

03:45.100 --> 03:46.099
on your wife's condition?

03:46.100 --> 03:48.098
She's still in surgery.

03:48.099 --> 03:49.099
You were working

03:49.100 --> 03:50.099
on your wife's campaign.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.128
I took a leave from my job.

03:52.129 --> 03:53.575
Had Mia received any threats

03:53.576 --> 03:55.019
from anyone?

03:55.020 --> 03:56.120
Anyone on the team

03:56.121 --> 03:57.218
acting suspiciously?

03:57.219 --> 04:00.019
Well, last night...

04:00.020 --> 04:01.120
one of the volunteers

04:01.121 --> 04:02.218
made a bit of a scene.

04:02.219 --> 04:05.019
He'd spent the day canvassing,

04:05.020 --> 04:06.020
and when he came back

04:06.021 --> 04:07.020
to headquarters,

04:07.021 --> 04:08.198
he was very agitated.

04:08.199 --> 04:09.675
He demanded to see Edwin,

04:09.676 --> 04:11.149
the campaign manager,

04:11.150 --> 04:12.150
in private.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.170
Then we could hear

04:13.171 --> 04:14.188
raised voices.

04:14.189 --> 04:16.220
- What was the argument about?
- I don't know.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.137
They were speaking Filipino.

04:18.139 --> 04:19.595
But I heard the word "denila"

04:19.596 --> 04:21.048
several times.

04:21.050 --> 04:23.170
- Honestly,
- it was all over pretty quick.

04:23.173 --> 04:24.635
The kid stormed off.

04:24.636 --> 04:26.099
Edwin said we shouldn't worry.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.110
- It was just.
- "end of the campaign" stress.

04:28.113 --> 04:29.473
- What was.
- The volunteer's name?

04:29.497 --> 04:31.148
Olly Navarro.

04:31.149 --> 04:33.100
- Well, now that.
- I think about it,

04:33.103 --> 04:35.229
Olly rides a motorcycle.

04:35.230 --> 04:38.148
Okay, we'll check him out.

04:38.149 --> 04:39.609
And we'll need a full list

04:39.610 --> 04:41.068
of your campaign employees.

04:41.069 --> 04:43.149
- Of course. I'll have someone.
- Send it right over.

04:43.173 --> 04:44.208
Thank you, Mr. Fuentes.

04:44.209 --> 04:46.230
- And we'll keep a good thought.
- For your wife.

04:52.110 --> 04:53.575
[upbeat music playing

05:23.000 --> 05:24.060
Okay, I'm

05:24.061 --> 05:25.119
looking up "denila."

05:25.120 --> 05:27.060
- It doesn't mean anything.
- In Filipino.

05:27.063 --> 05:28.530
Well, maybe it's a name.

05:28.531 --> 05:29.999
Damien, Tom.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.525
The security cameras from

05:31.526 --> 05:33.049
the parking lot in the alley

05:33.050 --> 05:35.000
- caught a partial view.
- Of the attack.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.085
Facial recognition's out,

05:36.086 --> 05:37.169
obviously.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.170
- And there's no license plate.
- On the bike.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.640
What's that?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.109
It's a gang tag...

05:42.110 --> 05:44.229
VB16, Vicious Bloods.

05:44.230 --> 05:45.670
That's the local chapter

05:45.671 --> 05:47.109
of the Asian gang.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.068
What's their makeup?

05:49.069 --> 05:50.080
Cambodian, Vietnamese,

05:50.081 --> 05:51.089
Filipino.

05:51.090 --> 05:53.119
So Olly Navarro's

05:53.120 --> 05:55.125
a campaign volunteer by day,

05:55.126 --> 05:57.128
gang member by night?

05:57.129 --> 05:58.159
Maybe VB16 had him

05:58.160 --> 05:59.188
infiltrate the campaign.

05:59.189 --> 06:01.129
- Maria's doing.
- A background check.

06:01.132 --> 06:03.009
- On Navarro right now.
- Good stuff.

06:03.012 --> 06:05.000
Thanks, Zayn.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.119
Will, can you do me a favor?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.130
Yeah, sure.

06:15.131 --> 06:16.138
Um, why are you yelling?

06:16.139 --> 06:18.159
Sorry, I have a migraine.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.585
I have to go home and rest.

06:19.586 --> 06:21.008
Can you cover for me?

06:21.009 --> 06:22.220
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

06:41.050 --> 06:43.059
Okay...

06:43.060 --> 06:46.099
All set, let's go.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.580
Head north towards

06:47.581 --> 06:49.059
Thomas Street.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.560
[bell clanging,

06:55.180 --> 06:56.705
[seat belt clicks,

07:03.230 --> 07:05.128
Olly Navarro is 24,

07:05.129 --> 07:07.100
- a naturalized citizen.
- Of Filipino origin.

07:07.103 --> 07:09.019
- What else do we know.
- About him?

07:09.022 --> 07:10.230
- There's not much we can tell.
- From immigration records,

07:10.233 --> 07:11.670
Other than that he was eight

07:11.671 --> 07:13.109
when he came to the U.S.

07:13.110 --> 07:15.069
- He'd been orphaned.
- In the Philippines,

07:15.072 --> 07:16.512
- Raised in foster care.
- Gang ties?

07:16.515 --> 07:18.099
Well, he's record's clean,

07:18.100 --> 07:19.555
but word on the street is

07:19.556 --> 07:21.008
he rides with VB16.

07:21.009 --> 07:23.489
- And the make and model of his.
- Motorbike registered at DMV,

07:23.513 --> 07:25.060
- Same one used.
- At the drive-by.

07:25.061 --> 07:26.189
- All right, well, why don't we.
- Just get a couple of unis,

07:26.192 --> 07:27.599
Go pick him up?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.008
Already done that.

07:29.009 --> 07:30.170
- Neighbor said that he hasn't.
- Been home since he left.

07:30.173 --> 07:32.093
- For campaign headquarters.
- Yesterday morning.

07:32.117 --> 07:33.645
If the gang is hiding him,

07:33.646 --> 07:35.219
he won't be easy to track down.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.710
Let's reach out to all

07:36.711 --> 07:38.198
the precincts in the city.

07:38.199 --> 07:39.690
Let's see if anyone

07:39.691 --> 07:41.179
has a CI in VB16,

07:41.180 --> 07:43.220
- and let them know.
- We're willing to make a deal.

07:43.244 --> 07:45.079
- For information.
- On Olly Navarro.

07:45.082 --> 07:46.199
- You got it.
- Will do.

07:46.202 --> 07:48.119
Okay?

07:48.120 --> 07:49.655
You have arrived

07:49.656 --> 07:51.188
at your destination.

09:02.059 --> 09:03.609
Yes, I'm at

09:03.610 --> 09:05.158
71 East Olive Street.

09:05.159 --> 09:09.158
A woman has been injured.

09:09.159 --> 09:10.159
No, I-I don't know

09:10.160 --> 09:11.159
what happened.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.164
Well, I'll tell you

09:13.165 --> 09:15.168
what happened.

09:15.169 --> 09:16.594
Crystal's daddy had too much

09:16.595 --> 09:18.018
to drink last night,

09:18.019 --> 09:19.579
and her Mom didn't move fast

09:19.580 --> 09:21.138
enough to get him breakfast.

09:21.139 --> 09:23.120
That's what happened.

09:25.059 --> 09:26.104
Yes, I can wait.

09:26.105 --> 09:27.149
Thank you.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.650
Abigail, how long

09:30.651 --> 09:32.099
has this been going on?

09:32.100 --> 09:33.219
Forever.

09:33.220 --> 09:34.720
And you're just wasting

09:34.721 --> 09:36.219
your time trying to help.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.090
You'll see.

09:55.019 --> 09:56.139
What are you going to tell

09:56.163 --> 09:57.163
the cops when they come?

09:57.190 --> 09:59.230
- That you know Hannah because.
- You talk to her dead daughter?

09:59.233 --> 10:00.710
I'll say I walked past the

10:00.711 --> 10:02.189
house on my way to somewhere,

10:02.190 --> 10:04.109
and I heard a baby crying.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.230
- The crying was still going on.
- When I walked past.

10:06.254 --> 10:07.584
An hour later,

10:07.585 --> 10:09.028
so I got worried.

10:09.029 --> 10:11.069
You're a good liar.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.570
You know who else

10:12.571 --> 10:14.069
is a good liar?

10:14.070 --> 10:16.019
My mom.

10:18.059 --> 10:21.018
Hannah.

10:21.019 --> 10:23.109
Hannah?

10:23.110 --> 10:24.555
Hi.

10:24.556 --> 10:25.999
Who are you?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.038
Where's the baby?

10:29.039 --> 10:30.559
- My name is Cassie.
- The baby's fine.

10:30.562 --> 10:32.195
I-I put her down in her crib.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.158
There's an ambulance coming.

10:34.159 --> 10:36.635
Ambulance?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.109
No, I'ml'm fine.

10:39.110 --> 10:41.115
I justoh, God, I took

10:41.116 --> 10:43.119
a tumble down the stairs.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.199
See?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.675
You should let them

10:45.676 --> 10:47.148
check you out.

10:47.149 --> 10:48.644
I-I think you were unconscious

10:48.645 --> 10:50.138
for a while.

10:50.139 --> 10:53.119
You may have a concussion.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.570
And if there's

10:54.571 --> 10:56.018
something else going on,

10:56.019 --> 10:57.589
they might be able

10:57.590 --> 10:59.158
to help with that, too.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.175
Look, uhhey,

11:01.176 --> 11:03.189
thanks for stopping.

11:03.190 --> 11:06.099
I got it from here.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.555
Are you sure?

11:07.556 --> 11:09.008
Yeah, positive.

11:09.009 --> 11:12.090
Yeah.

11:15.169 --> 11:17.125
Next time feel free

11:17.126 --> 11:19.080
to keep walking, okay?

11:22.169 --> 11:24.149
- I just hung up.
- With Vice in Lake City.

11:24.152 --> 11:26.009
- They brought in.
- A guy for possession.

11:26.012 --> 11:27.158
With ties to VB16.

11:27.159 --> 11:28.594
In exchange for a walk,

11:28.595 --> 11:30.028
he gave up the street name

11:30.029 --> 11:32.159
- of Olly Navarro's lieutenant...
- Guy named Q.

11:32.162 --> 11:34.110
- Did they get an actual name?
- Negative.

11:34.113 --> 11:35.560
But the perp did give them

11:35.561 --> 11:37.008
the address to Q's safe house.

11:37.009 --> 11:38.009
Excellent.

11:38.010 --> 11:39.009
Let's go take a look.

11:39.010 --> 11:40.119
Can you run the name "Q"?

11:40.120 --> 11:41.560
- See if you can get.
- An actual ID?

11:41.584 --> 11:43.070
- On it.
- Thank you.

11:43.073 --> 11:45.009
- Just going to talk to Cassie.
- For a second.

11:45.012 --> 11:47.092
- Sure. I'll arrange.
- A few units to bring with us.

11:47.116 --> 11:48.179
- Thanks.
- Hey, what's up?

11:48.182 --> 11:50.018
Hey, do you have a minute?

11:50.019 --> 11:51.619
- It's about something.
- Kind of tricky.

11:51.643 --> 11:54.138
Well, I specialize in tricky.

11:54.139 --> 11:56.219
Take a seat.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.640
Do remember the little girl

11:57.641 --> 11:59.058
who was staying with me?

11:59.059 --> 12:01.168
Abigail?

12:01.169 --> 12:03.109
I think her mom's in trouble.

12:03.110 --> 12:05.048
What kind of trouble?

12:05.049 --> 12:06.594
She's with a guy who's

12:06.595 --> 12:08.138
violent, and they have a baby.

12:08.139 --> 12:09.594
I, found her

12:09.595 --> 12:11.048
this morning

12:11.049 --> 12:12.054
after he clearly

12:12.055 --> 12:13.058
knocked her around.

12:13.059 --> 12:14.119
And she was a mess,

12:14.120 --> 12:15.178
so I called 911.

12:15.179 --> 12:17.049
- But then when.
- The ambulance came,

12:17.052 --> 12:18.054
She told them

12:18.055 --> 12:19.058
she fell down the stairs.

12:19.059 --> 12:21.259
- Well, if she's scared of him,
- she's got her reasons.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.100
- Can you just convince her.
- To leave him?

12:23.103 --> 12:24.219
I don't know.

12:24.220 --> 12:25.660
But it'll be fun

12:25.661 --> 12:27.100
to see you try.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.099
She's pretty resistant.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.058
Is there anything you can do?

12:33.059 --> 12:35.029
- To be honest,
- there's not much anybody can do.

12:35.032 --> 12:37.059
- If she refuses to file charges.
- On the guy.

12:37.062 --> 12:40.128
That's what I was afraid of.

12:40.129 --> 12:42.028
She'll never report him.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.519
I think she feels like

12:43.520 --> 12:45.008
she doesn't deserve any better.

12:45.009 --> 12:47.409
- I think she feels guilty.
- About what happened to Abigail.

12:47.412 --> 12:48.518
That's understandable.

12:48.519 --> 12:49.625
It's a parent's job

12:49.626 --> 12:51.028
to protect their child.

12:51.029 --> 12:53.148
Aw, see?

12:53.149 --> 12:55.189
He gets it.

12:55.190 --> 12:57.169
- Well, I'm not going.
- To give up on her.

12:57.172 --> 12:59.069
She needs help.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.570
Just don't be too surprised

13:00.571 --> 13:02.069
if she doesn't want your help.

13:02.070 --> 13:03.105
It sounds like

13:03.106 --> 13:04.138
she needs a professional.

13:04.139 --> 13:06.148
Yeah.

13:06.149 --> 13:07.170
Thanks.

13:07.171 --> 13:08.190
Okay, no problem.

13:10.149 --> 13:12.179
Good luck.

13:17.039 --> 13:19.070
[indistinct chatter

13:21.100 --> 13:23.100
No sign of Olly.

13:23.101 --> 13:25.099
The safe house was a dead end.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.570
Maybe not.

13:26.571 --> 13:28.038
You see that?

13:28.039 --> 13:29.594
You mean the scary tree

13:29.595 --> 13:31.148
with no leaves?

13:31.149 --> 13:32.230
Yeah.

13:37.119 --> 13:39.359
- I appreciate you wanting.
- To do something for Hannah,

13:39.362 --> 13:41.080
- But if she.
- Doesn't want your help...

13:41.083 --> 13:43.080
I thought maybe

13:43.081 --> 13:45.079
you could talk to her.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.540
She needs a professional,

13:46.541 --> 13:47.999
and you're a psychiatrist.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.015
I think she'd do better

13:49.016 --> 13:50.028
talking with someone

13:50.029 --> 13:52.080
- who specializes.
- In domestic-violence survivors.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.443
- You're all I've got.
- Right now.

13:53.467 --> 13:55.169
- Patients need to.
- Seek out therapists,

13:55.172 --> 13:57.038
Not the other way around.

13:57.039 --> 13:58.210
- I can't help someone.
- Who doesn't want to be helped,

13:58.213 --> 14:00.070
- And neither can you,
- for that matter.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.009
- I have to try...
- If not for Hannah,

14:02.012 --> 14:04.999
Then for the little baby.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.079
I know what it's like

14:06.080 --> 14:07.560
to grow up

14:07.561 --> 14:09.039
with a mom you can't rely on.

14:12.169 --> 14:14.229
Okay, I'll tell you what.

14:14.230 --> 14:15.640
If you can get her to agree

14:15.641 --> 14:17.048
to come see me,

14:17.049 --> 14:18.060
I will meet with her

14:18.061 --> 14:19.069
free of charge.

14:19.070 --> 14:21.351
- And I'll put together.
- Some names of shelters in town.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.290
- Where she can go and stay.
- With the baby.

14:23.293 --> 14:24.168
Thank you.

14:24.169 --> 14:26.049
- But steer clear.
- Of the boyfriend.

14:26.052 --> 14:28.159
- Don't put yourself at risk.
- I won't. I promise.

14:28.162 --> 14:29.209
Okay.

14:29.210 --> 14:32.168
I got to go.

14:32.169 --> 14:33.609
You're not working too hard,

14:33.610 --> 14:35.048
are you?

14:35.049 --> 14:37.000
- Someone's been talking.
- To Tom.

14:37.003 --> 14:38.100
- He might have.
- Casually mentioned.

14:38.103 --> 14:39.150
You've been having

14:39.151 --> 14:40.199
some headaches lately.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.610
He worries too much,

14:41.611 --> 14:43.018
and so do you.

14:43.019 --> 14:44.120
You worry about me.

14:44.121 --> 14:45.219
I worry about you.

14:45.220 --> 14:46.680
I hear this is how

14:46.681 --> 14:48.139
families work.

14:55.139 --> 14:58.220
Must be nice.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.630
What must be?

15:00.631 --> 15:02.038
Having a dad.

15:02.039 --> 15:03.584
I didn't have one, you know...

15:03.585 --> 15:05.129
just Grandpa.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.058
You've been practicing.

15:11.059 --> 15:12.640
You know, Crystal's dad

15:12.641 --> 15:14.219
is mean to my mom,

15:14.220 --> 15:17.099
but he's nice to the baby.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.665
They're so sweet.

15:18.666 --> 15:20.229
You should see them together.

15:20.230 --> 15:23.109
No, thanks. I'm good.

15:23.110 --> 15:25.008
He pays for everything.

15:25.009 --> 15:26.540
He always sends my mom flowers

15:26.541 --> 15:28.069
after they fight.

15:28.070 --> 15:30.040
If you think about it,

15:30.041 --> 15:32.008
you're breaking up a family.

15:32.009 --> 15:34.210
- You want to take the only daddy.
- Crystal has.

15:34.213 --> 15:36.230
And put him in jail?

15:38.169 --> 15:40.169
How come you never step in

15:40.170 --> 15:42.168
and help your mom, Abigail?

15:42.169 --> 15:43.599
I saw you push

15:43.600 --> 15:45.028
your grandpa around.

15:45.029 --> 15:46.060
What for?

15:46.061 --> 15:47.089
If this one went away,

15:47.090 --> 15:48.555
she'd just find

15:48.556 --> 15:50.018
another crappy boyfriend.

15:50.019 --> 15:51.168
All my mom knows how to do

15:51.169 --> 15:53.070
- is make bad choices.
- And cry all day.

15:53.073 --> 15:54.100
She's crying because

15:54.101 --> 15:55.128
she feels guilty

15:55.129 --> 15:57.018
for not protecting you.

15:57.019 --> 15:58.529
That's what you say,

15:58.530 --> 16:00.038
but I don't believe it.

16:00.039 --> 16:01.109
She just feels sorry

16:01.110 --> 16:02.178
for herself.

16:02.179 --> 16:04.039
- When they locked me up.
- In that box.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.240
After they made my face pretty

16:05.264 --> 16:07.120
- and put my.
- Favorite dress on me,

16:07.123 --> 16:09.120
- They asked her.
- If she wanted to stay.

16:09.123 --> 16:10.660
But she shook her head

16:10.661 --> 16:12.199
and said, "No, I can't."

16:12.200 --> 16:13.680
She put my toy bear,

16:13.681 --> 16:15.158
Otis, in with me,

16:15.159 --> 16:17.999
and she let them take me away.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.158
And do you know what they did?

16:21.159 --> 16:23.149
They set me on fire.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.165
That's just what people do

16:28.166 --> 16:30.229
when someone's dead...

16:30.230 --> 16:32.115
because your soul

16:32.116 --> 16:33.999
wasn't there anymore.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.109
That was just your body.

16:36.110 --> 16:37.615
The dress, too.

16:37.616 --> 16:39.119
I can't ever wear it again.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.168
And it was so pretty.

16:41.169 --> 16:43.089
I hate these.

16:43.090 --> 16:45.050
You're wearing those because

16:45.051 --> 16:47.008
you're stuck in a moment.

16:47.009 --> 16:49.000
- You've got all this.
- Pent-up anger,

16:49.003 --> 16:50.100
And it's pinned you

16:50.101 --> 16:51.199
to the night you died.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.089
It's got nothing to do

16:53.090 --> 16:55.250
- with what you were wearing.
- When you were cremated.

16:55.274 --> 16:57.089
She should have stayed

16:57.090 --> 16:59.028
with me until it was over.

16:59.029 --> 17:00.539
She should have made sure

17:00.540 --> 17:02.048
they did it right.

17:02.049 --> 17:04.230
- They gave her the little bag.
- That's just my ashes,

17:04.233 --> 17:07.128
And she put it in a drawer.

17:07.130 --> 17:10.048
She never talks to me.

17:10.049 --> 17:13.130
She deserves to be unhappy.

17:19.069 --> 17:21.064
If that's the way

17:21.065 --> 17:23.058
you feel, Abigail,

17:23.059 --> 17:26.008
then why'd you lead me there?

17:26.009 --> 17:27.609
I didn't, and I want you

17:27.611 --> 17:29.210
to go away.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.075
You know, my mom...

17:36.076 --> 17:38.008
She never talks to me either.

17:38.009 --> 17:40.018
Isn't your mom dead?

17:40.019 --> 17:41.019
Maybe she doesn't know

17:41.020 --> 17:42.020
you can hear her.

17:43.039 --> 17:45.088
No, she knows.

17:45.089 --> 17:46.110
My point is, Abigail,

17:46.111 --> 17:47.129
I know what it's like

17:47.130 --> 17:48.145
to have a mom

17:48.146 --> 17:49.160
who lets you down.

17:52.079 --> 17:53.584
The truth is, sometimes

17:53.585 --> 17:55.088
we stay mad at them

17:55.089 --> 17:57.115
because it's easy,

17:57.116 --> 17:59.139
not because it's right.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.595
I don't know

18:00.596 --> 18:02.048
what your mom did to you,

18:02.049 --> 18:04.008
but you're still alive.

18:04.009 --> 18:05.059
So don't talk to me

18:05.060 --> 18:06.109
like you understand.

18:14.099 --> 18:18.028
Fan out, guys.

18:18.029 --> 18:19.029
Go ahead and just work

18:19.030 --> 18:20.030
your way around.

18:22.069 --> 18:23.569
They might need them.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.068
Stand by.

18:25.069 --> 18:26.564
[indistinct chatter

18:31.109 --> 18:33.230
- Just make sure he's posted.
- By the door.

18:36.230 --> 18:39.048
Take a look at this.

18:39.049 --> 18:40.115
Sir, we got something.

18:40.116 --> 18:41.179
Watch your step.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.205
Check the barrels.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.230
Sarge, over here.

18:59.029 --> 19:01.130
It's Olly Navarro.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.210
The cause of death

19:09.160 --> 19:09.210
was a bullet

19:10.160 --> 19:12.108
from a .45 to the heart.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.000
- Based on body temp and rigor,
- probably sometime between

19:14.003 --> 19:15.190
- 1:00 and 5:00 a.m.
- yesterday morning.

19:15.193 --> 19:16.625
That's at least six hours

19:16.626 --> 19:18.058
before the drive-by.

19:18.059 --> 19:19.499
- Olly Navarro.
- Is not our shooter.

19:19.523 --> 19:21.220
- Looks like he was tortured.
- Yeah.

19:21.223 --> 19:23.118
And as far as torture goes,

19:23.119 --> 19:24.579
this is some pretty

19:24.580 --> 19:26.038
sophisticated stuff.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.574
You see this tape residue here?

19:27.575 --> 19:29.108
These abrasions suggest

19:29.109 --> 19:31.079
- that it was pulled.
- On and off repeatedly.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.242
- To asphyxiate him?
- Almost.

19:32.245 --> 19:34.130
- And then off for a breath.
- And back on.

19:34.133 --> 19:36.049
- When the asphyxiation.
- Didn't work,

19:36.052 --> 19:37.064
The killer went

19:37.065 --> 19:38.078
for an infallible method.

19:38.079 --> 19:40.078
Electric shock?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.625
Tongue, chest,

19:41.626 --> 19:43.169
genital trifecta.

19:43.170 --> 19:44.670
They used two electrodes,

19:44.671 --> 19:46.169
an entry point and an exit,

19:46.170 --> 19:47.590
to create a closed circuit

19:47.591 --> 19:49.008
in the body.

19:49.009 --> 19:50.209
It maximizes pain.

19:50.210 --> 19:51.690
The muscle contractions got

19:51.691 --> 19:53.169
so intense that it even caused

19:53.170 --> 19:54.170
the victim's left femur

19:54.171 --> 19:55.170
to fracture.

19:55.171 --> 19:57.120
Is this what they used

19:57.121 --> 19:59.068
to restrain him?

19:59.069 --> 20:01.088
You see this?

20:01.089 --> 20:02.110
Well, those are

20:02.111 --> 20:03.129
nautical knots.

20:03.130 --> 20:04.145
Our killer has

20:04.146 --> 20:05.159
sailing expertise.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.130
Along with torture techniques

20:07.131 --> 20:09.098
and gunplay.

20:09.099 --> 20:12.098
Amy, thank you.

20:12.099 --> 20:14.069
Yeah, good work.

20:18.140 --> 20:20.098
You again.

20:20.099 --> 20:22.220
- Look, if you're here for money,
- I got none, so...

20:22.223 --> 20:24.139
No, I...

20:24.140 --> 20:25.620
I wasn't completely honest

20:25.621 --> 20:27.098
with you the other day.

20:27.099 --> 20:28.655
I didn't just come by

20:28.656 --> 20:30.209
and find you.

20:30.210 --> 20:31.690
I was kind of led here.

20:31.691 --> 20:33.169
Led here?

20:33.170 --> 20:35.098
How?

20:35.099 --> 20:36.130
I'm still trying

20:36.131 --> 20:37.159
to figure that out.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.139
Can I come in?

20:40.140 --> 20:41.600
I-I waited until your

20:41.601 --> 20:43.058
boyfriend left with the baby.

20:43.059 --> 20:44.100
I was hoping

20:44.101 --> 20:45.139
we could talk...

20:45.140 --> 20:47.219
privately.

20:47.220 --> 20:49.180
It's important.

20:53.029 --> 20:54.549
So that's Olly's lieutenant?

20:54.550 --> 20:56.068
Yeah, he goes by Q.

20:56.069 --> 20:57.209
Full name, Quentin Hahn.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.290
- Pretty high up on.
- The Vicious Bloods food chain.

20:59.314 --> 21:01.099
- He operates.
- Out of the safe house.

21:01.102 --> 21:02.180
- Where we think.
- The kid was grabbed.

21:02.183 --> 21:04.170
- And Olly was taken out.
- By his own gang.

21:04.173 --> 21:06.190
- Wouldn't be the first time,
- would it?

21:06.193 --> 21:08.028
Maybe Olly turned on them,

21:08.029 --> 21:09.509
- refused to do the hit.
- On Fuentes.

21:09.512 --> 21:11.509
- If he tried to warn.
- The campaign manager,

21:11.512 --> 21:12.650
That could be why

21:12.651 --> 21:14.149
they fought at headquarters.

21:14.150 --> 21:17.018
We're about to find out.

21:17.019 --> 21:18.190
- So you going to tell me why.
- The hell you raided my house?

21:18.193 --> 21:19.205
We were looking

21:19.206 --> 21:20.219
for Olly Navarro.

21:20.220 --> 21:22.205
Why would he be there?

21:22.206 --> 21:24.189
When did you last see Olly?

21:24.190 --> 21:27.229
What's this about?

21:27.230 --> 21:29.139
Olly Navarro is dead.

21:29.140 --> 21:31.069
- We found him.
- Stuffed in a barrel.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.584
A stone's throw away

21:32.585 --> 21:34.098
from your safe house.

21:34.099 --> 21:36.200
- That's why we got to think.
- You did it,

21:36.203 --> 21:38.118
Or you know who did.

21:38.119 --> 21:40.069
No.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.078
You were his lieutenant.

21:43.079 --> 21:44.999
Was it a rival gang?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.159
No.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.620
Olly didn't ride with us.

21:47.621 --> 21:49.078
That was just a front.

21:49.079 --> 21:50.559
Olly grew up in

21:50.560 --> 21:52.038
a foster house on my block.

21:52.039 --> 21:53.999
- I put our tag on his bike.
- To let people know.

21:54.023 --> 21:55.600
He was under my protection...

21:55.601 --> 21:57.999
so they won't mess with him.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.500
He did me a solid once.

21:59.501 --> 22:00.999
What did he do for you?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.118
Saved my life.

22:03.119 --> 22:05.119
That kid was always wired,

22:05.120 --> 22:07.118
always on edge.

22:07.119 --> 22:08.160
- One day.
- I'm coming out of my crib.

22:08.163 --> 22:09.680
When a couple bangers cruise

22:09.681 --> 22:11.199
by looking to start something.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.660
Olly peeped them before I did

22:12.661 --> 22:14.118
and had me on the ground

22:14.119 --> 22:16.400
- before they even had their.
- Weapons out their jackets.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.523
- Sounds like he'd be.
- A fine addition to your gang.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.600
Yeah, but Olly

22:19.601 --> 22:21.008
wasn't like that.

22:21.009 --> 22:22.610
He went through stuff as a kid.

22:22.611 --> 22:24.209
It messed with his head.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.630
In the foster care?

22:25.631 --> 22:27.048
In the Philippines.

22:27.049 --> 22:28.640
But he didn't talk about it,

22:28.641 --> 22:30.229
not even to me.

22:30.230 --> 22:31.720
And I was the closest thing

22:31.721 --> 22:33.209
he had to family...

22:33.210 --> 22:34.700
until that Edwin guy

22:34.701 --> 22:36.189
started coming around, anyway.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.650
Edwin Bernal.

22:37.651 --> 22:39.108
The Fuentes campaign manager.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.000
- Edwin was from.
- The same town as Olly.

22:41.003 --> 22:42.068
Back in the Philippines.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.088
They hooked up here.

22:43.089 --> 22:45.009
- His family kind of.
- Took Olly in.

22:45.012 --> 22:46.610
Edwin got the kid a job,

22:46.611 --> 22:48.210
said he'd look out for him.

22:50.049 --> 22:51.130
But if he had stuck

22:51.131 --> 22:52.209
with me and my boys,

22:52.210 --> 22:54.210
maybe he'd still be alive.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.038
They'll be back soon.

23:01.039 --> 23:02.090
He won't like it

23:02.091 --> 23:03.139
if you're here.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.095
He took the baby to the park.

23:05.096 --> 23:07.048
He's so good with her.

23:07.049 --> 23:08.095
I mean, you could

23:08.096 --> 23:09.139
make assumptions

23:09.140 --> 23:11.260
- about people based on.
- The way they act sometimes,

23:11.284 --> 23:13.180
But that's not really

23:13.181 --> 23:15.180
who they are inside.

23:17.059 --> 23:18.125
I know he's good

23:18.126 --> 23:19.190
with Crystal.

23:22.059 --> 23:25.058
Abigail told me.

23:25.059 --> 23:26.595
Abigail never knew him.

23:26.596 --> 23:28.129
She was...

23:28.130 --> 23:30.210
Hehe came along after she...

23:33.140 --> 23:34.650
Who are you?

23:34.651 --> 23:36.159
What do you want?

23:36.160 --> 23:38.115
I don't want anything,

23:38.116 --> 23:40.068
I swear.

23:40.069 --> 23:42.549
I have a message from Abigail,

23:42.550 --> 23:45.028
and then if you want, I'll go.

23:45.029 --> 23:47.149
And I-I won't come back.

23:47.150 --> 23:48.690
Why should I believe

23:48.691 --> 23:50.229
anything you say?

23:50.230 --> 23:52.145
Abigail told me that

23:52.146 --> 23:54.058
at the funeral home,

23:54.059 --> 23:56.079
you put her favorite stuffed

23:56.080 --> 23:58.099
toy in the coffin with her.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.675
What is this, some trick

24:01.676 --> 24:03.169
you play on grieving mothers?

24:03.170 --> 24:05.595
It's disgusting.

24:05.596 --> 24:08.019
She called him Otis the bear.

24:11.109 --> 24:12.569
She also said you keep

24:12.570 --> 24:14.028
her ashes in a drawer,

24:14.029 --> 24:16.189
and you never talk to her.

24:16.190 --> 24:20.000
I think she wishes you would.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.200
I try to talk to her.

24:27.109 --> 24:30.149
I really do.

24:30.150 --> 24:32.630
But then I feel this emptiness,

24:32.631 --> 24:35.109
like I don't have the right.

24:37.079 --> 24:38.579
I think she blames me

24:38.580 --> 24:40.079
for what happened.

24:44.039 --> 24:45.219
I blame myself.

24:45.220 --> 24:46.685
Well, she's smarter

24:46.686 --> 24:48.149
than I thought.

24:48.150 --> 24:51.078
Tell her she's right.

24:51.079 --> 24:54.160
Tell her it's all her fault.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.045
Abigail doesn't blame you

24:59.046 --> 25:01.088
for what happened.

25:01.089 --> 25:04.008
She knows it's not your fault.

25:04.009 --> 25:05.110
That's not true.

25:05.111 --> 25:06.209
Stop it! Stop it right now!

25:06.210 --> 25:08.165
She sees you're in pain.

25:08.166 --> 25:10.118
She doesn't want that.

25:10.119 --> 25:11.140
Liar!

25:11.141 --> 25:12.159
You're a liar!

25:12.160 --> 25:14.999
Abigail forgives you.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.525
Now you need to

25:16.526 --> 25:18.049
forgive yourself.

25:24.079 --> 25:26.089
Was that her?

25:28.230 --> 25:29.650
She wants you to know

25:29.651 --> 25:31.068
she's here

25:31.069 --> 25:33.189
and that she loves you...

25:33.190 --> 25:35.095
and that if you want to talk

25:35.096 --> 25:37.000
to her, she'll listen.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.090
Because your daughter's

25:40.091 --> 25:42.048
at peace.

25:42.049 --> 25:44.054
I never want

25:44.055 --> 25:46.059
to see you again.

25:52.019 --> 25:53.169
What have you got?

25:53.170 --> 25:54.590
So Olly Navarro's

25:54.591 --> 25:56.008
immigration file

25:56.009 --> 25:58.409
- was practically nonexistent,
- but going off the new intel.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.720
That he and Edwin Bernal

25:59.721 --> 26:01.219
were from the same village...

26:01.220 --> 26:02.680
That would be Takaban,

26:02.681 --> 26:04.139
a small town

26:04.140 --> 26:06.220
- on the southern Philippine.
- Island of Mindanao...

26:06.244 --> 26:08.100
Apparently Takaban was

26:08.101 --> 26:10.058
wiped out in 2001.

26:10.059 --> 26:11.559
The Bernal family had already

26:11.560 --> 26:13.058
emigrated to the U.S. by then,

26:13.059 --> 26:15.180
- but Olly was still back home.
- Wiped out how?

26:15.183 --> 26:17.130
- Unclear.
- Some sort of violent conflict,

26:17.133 --> 26:19.018
Maybe a tribal thing.

26:19.019 --> 26:20.549
All I've been able to dig up

26:20.550 --> 26:22.078
are pictures an NGO took

26:22.079 --> 26:24.019
- when they came.
- Across the massacre,

26:24.022 --> 26:26.180
- But by the time help arrived,
- it was too late.

26:26.183 --> 26:28.108
Everyone was dead.

26:28.109 --> 26:29.150
Everyone except

26:29.151 --> 26:30.189
for six-year-old Olly.

26:30.190 --> 26:32.190
This must be the traumatic

26:32.191 --> 26:34.189
past Q was talking about.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.190
Thanks, Zayn.

26:35.191 --> 26:36.190
Sure thing.

26:36.191 --> 26:38.069
- Good work.
- Thanks.

26:40.109 --> 26:42.099
A horned monster.

26:46.059 --> 26:48.018
Two of our victims are from

26:48.019 --> 26:49.564
the same small town

26:49.565 --> 26:51.109
in the Philippines.

26:52.190 --> 26:55.039
That can't be a coincidence.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.160
I cannot believe

27:03.099 --> 27:04.099
you lied to her.

27:05.019 --> 27:06.160
- Therapists don't do stuff.
- Like that.

27:06.163 --> 27:07.643
- But maybe we should.
- I'm not sure.

27:07.667 --> 27:08.685
I may have made

27:08.686 --> 27:10.149
another mistake.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.099
- Well, what was.
- Your first mistake?

27:12.102 --> 27:14.039
- Bringing Abigail.
- To the prison.

27:14.042 --> 27:16.242
- She was so angry, and.
- I wanted to protect the baby,

27:16.266 --> 27:18.180
But I think

27:18.181 --> 27:20.159
she got worse there.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.069
- Well, here's your chance.
- To make it right.

27:22.072 --> 27:24.035
Or maybe I should just do

27:24.036 --> 27:25.999
as Abigail says

27:26.000 --> 27:27.219
and butt out...

27:27.220 --> 27:28.670
go back to trying

27:28.671 --> 27:30.118
to block this stuff.

27:30.119 --> 27:33.018
I'm not so sure about that.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.105
You were always the one

27:34.106 --> 27:35.189
trying to make it stop.

27:35.190 --> 27:37.160
- Well, making it stop.
- Completely is one thing.

27:37.163 --> 27:39.200
- I'm still for that.
- If we can figure out a way.

27:39.203 --> 27:41.115
But, you know, trying to

27:41.116 --> 27:43.028
block it or just ignoring it,

27:43.029 --> 27:45.039
- that didn't work out so well.
- For your mom.

27:45.042 --> 27:46.642
- Well, maybe.
- That's because she went.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.105
For the "drinking herself"

27:48.106 --> 27:50.008
"into a stupor" method.

27:50.009 --> 27:51.110
There might be

27:51.111 --> 27:52.209
something else I could try.

27:52.210 --> 27:54.038
Like medication?

27:54.039 --> 27:55.519
- Remember that summer,
- you were 16,

27:55.522 --> 27:56.650
And we put you

27:56.651 --> 27:58.108
on a low dose of Clozapine?

27:58.109 --> 28:00.088
I don't, actually.

28:00.089 --> 28:01.169
I...

28:01.170 --> 28:02.585
I might have slept

28:02.586 --> 28:04.000
through that.

28:05.049 --> 28:07.289
- Listen, you're not going.
- To get it right every time.

28:07.292 --> 28:09.038
But in the end,

28:09.039 --> 28:10.125
are you doing

28:10.126 --> 28:11.210
more good than bad?

28:18.170 --> 28:21.129
This is Hannah's number.

28:21.130 --> 28:24.149
Hello?

28:24.150 --> 28:26.039
- I just heard.
- From the hospital.

28:26.042 --> 28:27.544
Mia Fuentes is out of surgery.

28:27.545 --> 28:29.048
Her condition is stable.

28:29.049 --> 28:30.054
So you get to get

28:30.055 --> 28:31.058
her statement tomorrow.

28:31.059 --> 28:32.135
That's good to hear,

28:32.136 --> 28:33.209
but we no longer believe

28:33.210 --> 28:35.140
- it's a politically.
- Motivated hit.

28:35.143 --> 28:36.575
Ballistics confirmed the

28:36.576 --> 28:38.008
bullet that killed Olly Navarro

28:38.009 --> 28:39.014
was from the same weapon

28:39.015 --> 28:40.018
used in the drive-by.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.659
- Okay, now we're looking.
- For a killer.

28:41.683 --> 28:42.660
Who had a motive

28:42.661 --> 28:44.098
against Olly and Fuentes.

28:44.099 --> 28:45.155
Right.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.209
Take a seat.

28:46.210 --> 28:47.635
It turns out

28:47.636 --> 28:49.058
the campaign manager,

28:49.059 --> 28:50.549
Edwin Bernal...

28:50.550 --> 28:52.038
He was close with Olly.

28:52.039 --> 28:53.529
They were from the same village

28:53.530 --> 28:55.018
in the PhilippinesTakaban.

28:55.019 --> 28:56.120
Apparently there was

28:56.121 --> 28:57.219
a total solar eclipse

28:57.220 --> 28:58.655
in the southern Philippines

28:58.656 --> 29:00.088
in 1988.

29:00.089 --> 29:01.554
The villagers of Takaban

29:01.555 --> 29:03.018
believed it to be an omen.

29:03.019 --> 29:04.120
Then a farmer found

29:04.121 --> 29:05.219
a dead carabao

29:05.220 --> 29:06.635
that washed up by the swamp.

29:06.636 --> 29:08.048
A dead what?

29:08.049 --> 29:10.169
- It's a water buffalo,
- sacred in the Philippines...

29:10.172 --> 29:12.098
- A lot of superstition.
- Surrounding its death.

29:12.101 --> 29:13.150
A local fellow, Nimuel,

29:13.151 --> 29:14.229
jumps on that.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.640
He starts talking

29:15.641 --> 29:17.048
about judgment day.

29:17.049 --> 29:18.100
As in he started

29:18.101 --> 29:19.149
a doomsday cult?

29:19.150 --> 29:20.190
Yeah, and to solidify

29:20.191 --> 29:21.229
his control,

29:21.230 --> 29:22.630
he brings in a group

29:22.631 --> 29:24.028
of rogue soldiers

29:24.029 --> 29:26.349
- to basically murder and torture.
- Anyone who speaks out.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.569
The kind of torture

29:27.570 --> 29:29.068
that they did to Olly.

29:29.069 --> 29:30.149
Yeah.

29:30.150 --> 29:32.019
- Nimuel grew more.
- And more paranoid.

29:32.022 --> 29:33.190
- He became convinced.
- That the government.

29:33.193 --> 29:35.099
- Was coming.
- To take them all away.

29:35.102 --> 29:37.422
- Nimuel's soldiers slaughtered.
- Everyone in the village.

29:37.446 --> 29:39.155
Everyone but Olly Navarro.

29:39.156 --> 29:41.088
Somehow he escaped.

29:41.089 --> 29:42.219
Fast forward 18 years later,

29:42.220 --> 29:43.655
and Olly connects with

29:43.656 --> 29:45.088
other Filipino emigrants.

29:45.089 --> 29:47.059
And eventually he meets

29:47.060 --> 29:49.028
someone else from Takaban.

29:49.029 --> 29:50.029
Edwin Bernal.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.029
So Edwin knows

29:51.030 --> 29:52.430
- all about.
- Olly's troubled past.

29:52.454 --> 29:53.675
He sympathizes,

29:53.676 --> 29:55.159
even gives the kid a job

29:55.160 --> 29:57.119
- canvassing houses.
- For Mia Fuentes.

29:57.122 --> 29:59.159
Okay, so...

29:59.160 --> 30:00.675
Both of our victims

30:00.676 --> 30:02.189
share a violent past.

30:02.190 --> 30:03.999
Probably had something to do

30:04.000 --> 30:05.400
- with their murders,
- but why now?

30:05.403 --> 30:07.380
- Well, that's what we're.
- Trying to figure out.

30:07.383 --> 30:08.620
We're tracing Olly

30:08.621 --> 30:10.038
and Edwin's final steps.

30:10.039 --> 30:11.539
Okay, well, keep me posted.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.039
Will do.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.020
Hey.

30:17.021 --> 30:19.038
Um, I can't stay long.

30:19.039 --> 30:20.100
Crystal's with a sitter.

30:20.101 --> 30:21.159
Yeah, that's okay.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.620
Come in, this is Brian.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.078
Brian, Hannah.

30:24.079 --> 30:25.719
- It's really nice.
- To meet you, Hannah.

30:25.743 --> 30:26.715
Same.

30:26.716 --> 30:28.229
So what do we do now?

30:28.230 --> 30:30.350
- Well, you and I are going.
- To talk a little bit...

30:30.353 --> 30:31.800
About what's going on with you,

30:31.801 --> 30:33.058
and what your options are.

30:33.059 --> 30:35.210
- Yeah, I'm going to.
- Leave you alone to do that.

30:35.213 --> 30:36.620
Call me later and tell me

30:36.621 --> 30:38.028
how it went, okay?

30:38.029 --> 30:40.039
- Okay.
- There's a pot of coffee on.

30:40.042 --> 30:41.482
- I'm just going.
- To get my jacket.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.129
Okay.

30:43.130 --> 30:46.000
You want to head this way?

30:50.009 --> 30:52.009
I wasn't going to come back.

30:52.010 --> 30:54.008
I was so mad.

30:54.009 --> 30:56.008
But Mom talked to me today.

30:56.009 --> 30:58.088
She said she was sorry.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.069
She told me a story

31:00.070 --> 31:02.048
about her sister, Molly.

31:02.049 --> 31:04.000
- I didn't know.
- You had an aunt.

31:04.003 --> 31:05.095
I don't.

31:05.096 --> 31:06.189
Not really.

31:06.190 --> 31:07.690
She killed herself

31:07.691 --> 31:09.189
when Mom was 15.

31:09.190 --> 31:11.088
Mom thinks...

31:11.089 --> 31:13.169
She thinks maybe Grandpa

31:13.170 --> 31:14.655
did to Molly

31:14.656 --> 31:16.139
the same stuff he did to me.

31:16.140 --> 31:19.008
Mom said she didn't know.

31:19.009 --> 31:21.179
Do you believe her?

31:21.180 --> 31:24.018
I do.

31:24.019 --> 31:25.059
But I'm still so mad

31:25.060 --> 31:26.098
it happened.

31:26.099 --> 31:27.620
I think about it,

31:27.621 --> 31:29.140
and I just want to...

31:33.090 --> 31:35.210
- You have to learn to control.
- Your anger, Abigail.

31:35.213 --> 31:37.000
- Why?
- Because you're just.

31:37.003 --> 31:39.130
Making yourself more unhappy.

31:42.220 --> 31:46.078
When I was about your age,

31:46.079 --> 31:47.610
I was seeing

31:47.611 --> 31:49.139
lots of scary stuff...

31:49.140 --> 31:51.139
Stuff that wasn't there

31:51.140 --> 31:52.640
and stuff that I couldn't

31:52.641 --> 31:54.139
do anything about.

31:54.140 --> 31:56.219
But I couldn't handle it,

31:56.220 --> 32:00.028
so I started acting out.

32:00.029 --> 32:01.549
My mom, she knew

32:01.550 --> 32:03.068
it was otherworldly,

32:03.069 --> 32:04.600
so she didn't take me

32:04.601 --> 32:06.129
to therapy or anything.

32:06.130 --> 32:08.068
She took me to a shaman.

32:08.069 --> 32:09.209
What's a shaman?

32:09.210 --> 32:13.068
It's like a wise person.

32:13.069 --> 32:15.068
He told me

32:15.069 --> 32:17.130
that we all have

32:17.131 --> 32:19.189
two wolves inside us.

32:19.190 --> 32:23.149
One is kind and generous

32:23.150 --> 32:25.219
and moves toward the light.

32:25.220 --> 32:28.189
The other is violent and angry

32:28.190 --> 32:31.088
and brings despair.

32:31.089 --> 32:32.615
The two wolves

32:32.616 --> 32:34.139
are always fighting,

32:34.140 --> 32:36.088
but only one will win.

32:36.089 --> 32:38.028
Which one?

32:38.029 --> 32:41.150
The one you feed.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.220
I'll see you later, okay?

34:02.089 --> 34:03.169
Mia Fuentes' husband said

34:03.193 --> 34:04.193
that when Edwin and Olly

34:04.220 --> 34:06.180
- were arguing at.
- Campaign headquarters,

34:06.183 --> 34:07.660
He heard the name.

34:07.661 --> 34:09.138
Denila several times.

34:09.139 --> 34:11.050
- Yeah, and?
- It turns out.

34:11.053 --> 34:13.010
- Colonel Denila is the alias.
- Of a criminal.

34:13.013 --> 34:14.493
- Wanted by.
- Philippine authorities.

34:14.516 --> 34:15.168
Wanted for what?

34:15.170 --> 34:17.099
- Denila was Nimuel's.
- Hired gun.

34:17.101 --> 34:19.018
- He led the massacre.
- Of the village.

34:19.022 --> 34:21.139
- Interpol issued a Red Notice.
- On him in 2004.

34:21.141 --> 34:23.018
Hasn't been seen since.

34:23.018 --> 34:25.259
- Fled the Philippines,
- suspected of hiding in the U.S.

34:25.262 --> 34:28.158
Now, we think Olly

34:28.159 --> 34:29.168
saw Denila here.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.178
In Seattle?

34:30.179 --> 34:32.119
- Why else would.
- Denila's name come up.

34:32.121 --> 34:34.601
- In a heated conversation with.
- Edwin all these years later?

34:34.626 --> 34:35.708
And that torture that Olly

34:35.710 --> 34:37.197
suffered was very specific.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.219
- We've never seen.
- Anything like that locally.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.199
And Olly and Edwin

34:40.199 --> 34:42.179
- were from the same town.
- In the Philippines.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.619
Where Denila carried out

34:43.620 --> 34:45.058
the massacre.

34:45.059 --> 34:46.259
So you're saying that Denila

34:46.283 --> 34:47.645
is hiding in plain sight

34:47.646 --> 34:49.069
under an assumed name.

34:49.070 --> 34:50.540
Invisible to law enforcement,

34:50.541 --> 34:52.009
unrecognizable to anyone.

34:52.010 --> 34:54.109
Except Olly.

34:54.110 --> 34:55.168
Picture this, okay?

34:55.170 --> 34:57.139
- The kid's out there.
- He's canvassing.

34:57.141 --> 34:58.189
He's knocking on doors.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.690
Who greets him one time?

34:59.691 --> 35:01.189
The Colonel.

35:01.190 --> 35:03.390
- Wait, wait, wait, this.
- Massacre happened years ago.

35:03.414 --> 35:04.229
Olly was just a kid.

35:04.230 --> 35:06.190
- The Colonel wouldn't.
- Have recognized him.

35:06.193 --> 35:08.150
- No, but Olly would have.
- Recognized Denila.

35:08.153 --> 35:09.230
- It's hard to forget.
- The face of the man.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.150
- Who blew your world.
- To smithereens.

35:11.153 --> 35:13.353
- And something about Olly's.
- Reaction gives him away.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.109
Denila knows he's been made.

35:15.110 --> 35:16.670
- He's got to keep.
- Olly quiet, right?

35:16.694 --> 35:17.630
He follows him,

35:17.631 --> 35:19.029
he grabs him at the safe house,

35:19.030 --> 35:20.149
and he tortures him.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.590
He wants to know who Olly

35:21.591 --> 35:23.029
might have told.

35:23.030 --> 35:25.190
- Olly fights hard,
- but he gives up Edwin Bernal.

35:25.193 --> 35:26.205
And then...

35:26.206 --> 35:27.218
This is the clever bit...

35:27.219 --> 35:28.649
Denila uses Olly's motorbike

35:28.650 --> 35:30.078
in the shooting

35:30.079 --> 35:31.119
of Mia Fuentes

35:31.120 --> 35:32.158
and Edwin Bernal,

35:32.159 --> 35:33.635
and he makes it

35:33.636 --> 35:35.110
look like a gang hit.

35:37.079 --> 35:39.029
It's a damn good plan.

35:39.030 --> 35:41.159
- Yeah. We're cross-referencing.
- DMV records with the addresses.

35:41.162 --> 35:43.119
- Olly canvassed.
- On the day he was murdered.

35:43.122 --> 35:44.659
And what if Olly ran into.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.198
Denila at a coffee shop?

35:46.199 --> 35:48.039
- Then he'll be.
- A lot harder to find.

35:48.042 --> 35:50.158
Right.

35:50.159 --> 35:52.119
Excuse us.

35:57.159 --> 35:58.169
You were surrounded

35:58.170 --> 35:59.178
by dead bodies?

35:59.179 --> 36:01.150
- It was more like.
- Buried underneath them.

36:01.153 --> 36:02.615
That's how Olly

36:02.616 --> 36:04.078
survived the massacre.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.118
Is there anything else?

36:05.119 --> 36:06.999
There was a lighthouse,

36:07.000 --> 36:08.525
and I could hear seagulls

36:08.526 --> 36:10.049
and waves on the shore.

36:10.050 --> 36:12.010
- But Takaban's.
- Several miles inland.

36:12.013 --> 36:13.105
We'll figure it out.

36:13.106 --> 36:14.198
Thanks, kid.

36:14.199 --> 36:16.209
Yeah, thanks.

36:16.210 --> 36:18.605
The sea.

36:18.606 --> 36:20.999
What could that mean?

36:21.000 --> 36:24.078
I think we found the Colonel.

36:24.079 --> 36:25.169
George Duane West.

36:25.170 --> 36:26.170
Nothing on his record

36:26.171 --> 36:27.170
before 2004.

36:27.171 --> 36:29.079
- It's like he didn't.
- Even exist before then.

36:29.082 --> 36:31.010
- That's when he was last.
- Spotted in the Philippines.

36:31.013 --> 36:32.373
- Now he works.
- Private security.

36:32.397 --> 36:34.159
- Fits his profile.
- His boss says George.

36:34.162 --> 36:36.130
- Is a good employee,
- keeps to himself.

36:36.133 --> 36:38.453
- He also said George showed up.
- For his shift on Monday.

36:38.477 --> 36:40.010
- Yesterday.
- He must have thought.

36:40.013 --> 36:41.070
He'd gotten away with it.

36:41.071 --> 36:42.129
Today he called in sick.

36:42.130 --> 36:44.169
He's on to plan Brunning.

36:44.170 --> 36:46.049
Let's get SWAT on to this.

36:46.050 --> 36:47.070
Denila's armed,

36:47.071 --> 36:48.090
extremely dangerous.

36:59.219 --> 37:02.018
Clear.

37:02.019 --> 37:03.219
It's clear.

37:07.179 --> 37:09.218
Great, thanks.

37:09.219 --> 37:11.199
[indistinct chatter

37:13.179 --> 37:15.099
CSU found a vat of

37:15.100 --> 37:17.018
sodium hydroxide in the garage.

37:17.019 --> 37:18.179
- Looks like we got.
- To Olly's body.

37:18.182 --> 37:20.059
- Before Denila could destroy.
- The evidence.

37:20.062 --> 37:22.059
- If these bullets match.
- The ones used in the drive-by,

37:22.062 --> 37:24.182
- That'll be enough to.
- Send him to prison for life.

37:24.185 --> 37:25.382
- Assuming we can find him.
- Before he vanishes.

37:25.385 --> 37:26.615
For another 20 years.

37:26.616 --> 37:28.009
That was Zayn on the line.

37:28.010 --> 37:30.000
- Apparently our suspect,
- Mr. George West,

37:30.003 --> 37:32.363
- Has just purchased a one-way.
- Train ticket to Vancouver.

37:32.387 --> 37:33.640
Swanstrom says that

37:33.641 --> 37:35.049
she's deployed a unit

37:35.050 --> 37:36.610
- to King Street Station.
- As we speak.

37:36.613 --> 37:38.120
Great, let's go grab the guy.

37:38.121 --> 37:39.229
You see these?

37:39.230 --> 37:41.165
Do you remember Cassie

37:41.166 --> 37:43.098
saw the sea...

37:43.099 --> 37:44.209
and a lighthouse?

37:44.210 --> 37:45.720
Olly's body was covered

37:45.721 --> 37:47.229
in nautical knots.

37:47.230 --> 37:49.229
What are you thinking?

37:49.230 --> 37:51.179
- We check local marinas.
- For boats.

37:51.182 --> 37:53.110
- Registered under.
- The Colonel's fake name?

37:53.113 --> 37:54.229
He knows we're onto him.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.625
I've got a feeling

37:55.626 --> 37:57.018
that train ticket is a decoy.

37:57.019 --> 38:00.190
The Colonel's leaving by sea.

38:04.070 --> 38:06.218
Cassie!

38:06.219 --> 38:07.685
Cassie!

38:07.686 --> 38:09.149
Come quick!

38:09.150 --> 38:12.030
It's my mom!

38:19.199 --> 38:20.199
Hannah?

38:20.139 --> 38:21.139
Are you okay?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.118
What are you doing here?

38:23.119 --> 38:24.479
- What happened?
- Where's Crystal?

38:24.482 --> 38:26.029
She's in her crib asleep.

38:26.030 --> 38:27.095
I'm just sitting here

38:27.096 --> 38:28.158
working up the courage

38:28.159 --> 38:29.659
to call the cops

38:29.660 --> 38:31.159
and turn myself in.

38:37.139 --> 38:41.110
Myoh, my God.

38:44.079 --> 38:47.109
He came home early, and...

38:47.110 --> 38:48.570
he caught me packing

38:48.571 --> 38:50.029
to leave.

38:50.030 --> 38:51.530
He said, "I'm gonna kill you."

38:51.531 --> 38:53.029
I said, "Go ahead."

38:53.030 --> 38:55.010
- I can't live.
- "Like this anymore."

38:55.013 --> 38:56.610
And he said, "I'm going"

38:56.611 --> 38:58.209
to kill Crystal, too."

38:58.210 --> 39:00.038
And he grabbed the knife,

39:00.039 --> 39:01.559
- and as he was walking.
- To her room,

39:01.583 --> 39:02.605
I thought,

39:02.606 --> 39:04.038
"God, not again."

39:04.039 --> 39:06.038
This time...

39:06.039 --> 39:07.525
I can't say I didn't know

39:07.526 --> 39:09.009
what was happening.

39:09.010 --> 39:11.045
This time

39:11.046 --> 39:13.078
I'm not going to let...

39:13.079 --> 39:17.170
anyone hurt my child.

39:24.079 --> 39:26.079
Yeah, it's okay.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.110
It'll be okay.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.525
[sirens wailing

39:49.010 --> 39:50.615
Seattle Police!

39:50.616 --> 39:52.218
Don't move!

39:52.219 --> 39:53.715
Let me see your hands!

39:53.716 --> 39:55.210
Let me see your hands!

39:59.119 --> 40:01.209
Hold it right there!

40:01.210 --> 40:02.670
George West,

40:02.671 --> 40:04.129
you're under arrest

40:04.130 --> 40:05.675
for the murder of Edwin Bernal

40:05.676 --> 40:07.218
and Olly Navarro...

40:07.219 --> 40:09.159
and the attempted murder

40:09.160 --> 40:11.098
of Mia Fuentes.

40:11.099 --> 40:13.018
You got the wrong guy.

40:13.019 --> 40:15.179
- Then we'll hand you off.
- To Interpol and the Hague,

40:15.182 --> 40:16.247
And you will stand trial

40:16.248 --> 40:17.635
for crimes

40:17.636 --> 40:19.189
against humanity, Colonel.

40:19.190 --> 40:21.099
- You have the right.
- To remain silent.

40:21.102 --> 40:22.210
Anything you say...

40:26.139 --> 40:28.149
Hi.

40:28.150 --> 40:30.018
I spoke with the detective

40:30.019 --> 40:31.059
assigned to your case

40:31.060 --> 40:32.098
and the ADA.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.555
They're confident you acted

40:33.556 --> 40:35.009
in self-defense.

40:35.010 --> 40:36.219
They won't be filing charges.

40:38.099 --> 40:40.109
Thanks, Tom.

40:40.110 --> 40:41.218
What about Crystal?

40:41.219 --> 40:45.009
Will I lose my baby?

40:45.010 --> 40:46.060
Don't worry. I'll speak

40:46.061 --> 40:47.109
with Social Services.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.230
- There's still a spot for you.
- Over at the shelter.

40:49.254 --> 40:50.199
I'll take you

40:50.200 --> 40:51.218
over there tonight.

40:51.219 --> 40:52.725
And if you need anything,

40:52.726 --> 40:54.229
even just to talk,

40:54.230 --> 40:56.049
please reach out.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.050
You should.

40:57.051 --> 40:58.050
He's the best.

40:58.051 --> 40:59.209
Thank you.

40:59.210 --> 41:01.109
I will.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.109
And...

41:03.110 --> 41:05.189
thank you...

41:05.190 --> 41:07.119
for everything.

41:21.110 --> 41:24.189
Hey, sleepyhead.

41:24.190 --> 41:28.118
Look what I found.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.078
It's as pretty as you said.

41:30.079 --> 41:31.579
I just wanted to show you

41:31.580 --> 41:33.078
before saying good-bye.

41:33.079 --> 41:35.189
Where are you going?

41:35.190 --> 41:37.198
Not back to see Grandpa, right?

41:37.199 --> 41:39.078
I have other plans.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.319
- You said someone called you.
- To come and help my mom,

41:41.343 --> 41:43.198
But it wasn't me.

41:43.199 --> 41:44.600
I think maybe

41:44.601 --> 41:45.999
it was my Aunt Molly.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.038
I'm going to go find her.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.038
I think that's a great idea.

41:50.039 --> 41:51.625
If I see your mom, I'll tell

41:51.626 --> 41:53.209
her you're not angry at her.

41:53.210 --> 41:56.130
Maybe then she'll come see you.

41:57.199 --> 41:59.198
Maybe.

41:59.199 --> 42:01.118
Don't you get stuck, too.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.619
Sometimes we stay mad

42:02.620 --> 42:04.118
because it's easy,

42:04.119 --> 42:06.090
not because it's right.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.219
Good point.

42:12.070 --> 42:16.038
And one more thing.

42:16.039 --> 42:17.585
I'm going to feed

42:17.586 --> 42:19.130
the good wolf.
