WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
- OKAY, HERE IT IS.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.533
- NICE AND HOT.

00:04.533 --> 00:06.500
YOU'RE GOING TO WISH YOU ORDERED
MORE EGG ROLLS, RAYMOND.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.300
- WHY?
- 'CAUSE I ATE 'EM IN THE CAR.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.167
- SORRY WE TOOK SO LONG,

00:12.167 --> 00:13.800
BUT LISTEN TO THIS.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.767
WHILE WE WERE WAITING
FOR OUR ORDER IN THE BAR,

00:16.767 --> 00:20.667
ROBERT GOT DISCOVERED!

00:20.667 --> 00:22.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:22.367 --> 00:26.633
- DISCOVERED AS IN,
"HEY, I FOUND BIGFOOT"?

00:26.633 --> 00:28.567
- NO, REALLY!

00:28.567 --> 00:30.667
THIS MODELING AGENT
CAME OVER TO US

00:30.667 --> 00:32.567
AND SAID ROBERT
HAD AN INTERESTING LOOK.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.300
HE SAID HE SHOULD COME IN
FOR A MEETING.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.833
HERE'S HIS CARD.

00:35.833 --> 00:38.800
- ROBERT, THIS IS TERRIFIC.
YOU SHOULD CALL HIM.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.600
- AW, COME ON.
THE GUY WAS PROBABLY DRUNK.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.833
- YEAH.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.067
OR BLIND.

00:45.067 --> 00:46.633
OR--OR MENTALLY--

00:46.633 --> 00:48.200
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET'S JUST GO

00:48.200 --> 00:49.900
WITH BLIND AND DRUNK,
ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND?

00:49.900 --> 00:51.200
- COME ON, ROBERT.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.700
AREN'T YOU
A LITTLE BIT INTRIGUED?

00:52.700 --> 00:54.800
- YEAH, WHAT IF HE WASN'T
ANY OF THOSE THINGS?

00:54.800 --> 00:56.533
- WELL, HE MUST'VE BEEN
ALL THOSE THINGS,

00:56.533 --> 00:58.067
OR HE WOULD'VE GIVEN
HIS CARD TO THE REAL BEAUTY

00:58.067 --> 01:01.667
IN THE RESTAURANT.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.367
MY AMY.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.100
- OH...MY HANDSOME MODEL.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.233
- YEAH.

01:08.233 --> 01:11.833
- AW, HOW AM I
GOING TO EAT NOW?

01:11.833 --> 01:14.600
- YOU KNOW, YOU COULD KISS
YOUR WIFE ONCE IN A WHILE.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.233
- LET'S EAT.

01:37.733 --> 01:41.167
- [hyperventilating]

01:56.333 --> 01:58.267
HELLO, I'M HERE
TO SEE WILLIAM DENNISON.

01:58.267 --> 02:02.700
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- BOBBY BARONE.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.767
- WHO?

02:04.767 --> 02:08.433
- ROBERT BARONE.

02:08.433 --> 02:12.233
- OH, HERE YOU ARE.
OKAY, HAVE A SEAT.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.367
- 'SUP?

02:35.367 --> 02:37.267
- OKAY, ROBERT,
MR. DENNISON WILL SEE YOU NOW.

02:37.267 --> 02:38.300
JUST RIGHT THROUGH THAT DOOR.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.333
- [high-pitched]
THANK YOU.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.167
[clears throat]
THANK YOU.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.833
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEND HER
HEADSHOTS OUT THIS AFTERNOON.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.000
THANKS.
HEY, ROBERT.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.467
HAVE A SEAT.
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.867
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT ALL THIS?

02:56.867 --> 02:59.500
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT MUCH OF A LOOKER

02:59.500 --> 03:01.633
IN THE, UH, SOBER LIGHT OF DAY.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.267
AM I RIGHT?

03:03.267 --> 03:05.333
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU SAW ME
AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.000
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY KNOWN
FOR THEIR LIGHTING.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.367
SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IF YOU THINK--

03:09.367 --> 03:12.100
- ROBERT, ROBERT, RELAX.
WE'RE JUST TALKING.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.000
- OKAY.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.033
- SO HOW TALL ARE YOU?

03:16.033 --> 03:21.767
- UH, I'M 6'8 1/2",
BUT I CAN SCHLUMP TO 6'5".

03:21.767 --> 03:23.133
- NO, NO.

03:23.133 --> 03:25.433
ACTUALLY, ONE OF
THE TOUGHEST THINGS TO FIND

03:25.433 --> 03:28.133
IS SOMEONE WHO'S TALL
WHO ALSO PHOTOGRAPHS WELL.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.900
MOST OF THE GUYS
YOUR HEIGHT ARE...

03:29.900 --> 03:31.833
WELL, THEY'RE MORE LIKE...

03:31.833 --> 03:34.433
CIRCUS FREAKS.

03:41.433 --> 03:44.567
- SO I'M NOT A CIRCUS FREAK?

03:44.567 --> 03:46.033
- I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A COVER MODEL.

03:46.033 --> 03:47.367
BUT A LOT OF WHAT WE DO HERE

03:47.367 --> 03:49.533
IS MORE ON THE PAGES
BETWEEN THE COVERS,

03:49.533 --> 03:51.500
WHERE THE ADVERTISERS WANT,
YOU KNOW, CHARACTER FACES

03:51.500 --> 03:55.367
TO SELL EVERYTHING FROM
NEW CARS TO HEADACHE MEDICINES.

03:55.367 --> 03:58.000
- OH, YEAH, I COULD BE
THE HEADACHE GUY.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.067
I GET HEADACHES ALL THE TIME.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.867
YOU SHOULD MEET MY FAMILY.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.900
- OKAY, NOW, JUST BECAUSE
I THINK YOU HAVE A GOOD LOOK

04:04.900 --> 04:07.333
DOESN'T MEAN THE ADVERTISERS
ARE GOING TO AGREE.

04:07.333 --> 04:08.967
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

04:08.967 --> 04:10.567
- INTERESTING.

04:10.567 --> 04:13.500
NOW, WHEN YOU SAY
"NEVER KNOW..."

04:13.500 --> 04:15.167
- WELL, YOU MAY
NEVER BOOK ANYTHING.

04:15.167 --> 04:18.533
OR YOU MAY BOOK
A FEW PRINT JOBS.

04:18.533 --> 04:24.200
- AND WHAT WOULD
SOMETHING LIKE THAT PAY?

04:24.200 --> 04:25.833
- A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.667
BUT I ALSO HAVE MY TOP PEOPLE
OUT THERE DOING COMMERCIALS,

04:27.667 --> 04:31.067
AND THEY'RE PULLING DOWN
100, 150 GRAND A YEAR.

04:37.033 --> 04:39.467
- I'M IN!

04:39.467 --> 04:41.733
- OKAY,
BUT LET'S UNDERSTAND...

04:41.733 --> 04:43.400
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.567
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS
SEND YOU OUT A COUPLE TIMES,

04:45.567 --> 04:47.667
SEE WHAT KIND
OF REACTION WE GET.

04:47.667 --> 04:48.567
- OKAY. GREAT!

04:48.567 --> 04:50.567
- YEAH.
- YEAH. OH, AND, HEY.

04:50.567 --> 04:53.067
LET 'EM KNOW
I'M NOT AFRAID TO GO GREEN.

04:53.067 --> 04:55.200
- EXCUSE ME?
- GO GREEN.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.167
YOU KNOW, IN CASE
THEY WANT ME TO SELL VEGETABLES.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.367
- OH.
- YEAH.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.567
AND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALSO
TELL ME THAT I HAVE A GOOD VOICE

05:07.567 --> 05:08.900
IN CASE THEY WANT ME
TO, YOU KNOW,

05:08.900 --> 05:10.533
TALK IN ANY OF THE ADS.

05:10.533 --> 05:15.067
[deep voice]
"THIS IS CNN."

05:17.567 --> 05:21.067
- LET'S JUST FOCUS ON PRINT ADS
FOR THE TIME BEING, HMM?

05:21.067 --> 05:23.167
- RIGHT, SURE, PRINT,
FOCUS, GOOD, GOOD.

05:23.167 --> 05:25.967
- OKAY, WELL, THE FIRST THING
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS

05:25.967 --> 05:29.667
GO OUT AND GET SOME HEADSHOTS
TO START YOUR PORTFOLIO.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.400
NOW HERE ARE THE NAMES
OF SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS

05:31.400 --> 05:32.933
OTHER PEOPLE
WITH THE AGENCY HAVE USED,

05:32.933 --> 05:35.167
OR YOU COULD JUST USE
OUR IN-HOUSE GUY IF YOU WANT.

05:35.167 --> 05:38.600
- THAT'S SOUNDS GRRRREAT!

05:42.500 --> 05:44.133
TONY THE TIGER.

05:44.133 --> 05:47.267
I--I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT GUY
DIED ALREADY OR ANYTHING.

05:47.267 --> 05:48.900
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT,
YOU KNOW,

05:48.900 --> 05:52.233
MAYBE NEED A NEW TIGER.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.167
- OH, MY GOD!

05:57.167 --> 05:59.267
YOU GUYS ARE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!

05:59.267 --> 06:01.133
OKAY, ROBERT!

06:15.067 --> 06:18.933
- HEY.

06:18.933 --> 06:22.333
- HE WENT TO THE AGENCY,
THEY SIGNED HIM AS A CLIENT.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.400
HE ALREADY HAD
HIS PHOTO SESSION WITH HERBERT,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.233
AND THEY'RE GOING TO START
SENDING HIM OUT RIGHT AWAY.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.633
- WHY IS UNCLE ROBERT
STANDING LIKE THAT?

06:35.633 --> 06:36.633
- WELL, ALLY...

06:36.633 --> 06:41.733
- BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
IS A MODEL.

06:41.733 --> 06:46.600
- AND SOMETIMES MODELS
WEAR TIGHT UNDERWEAR.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.067
- STOP IT, RAY.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.167
NO, ROBERT, I JUST THINK
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.567
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID
THAT YOU WERE HANDSOME.

06:55.567 --> 06:59.000
- AND THEN WE WOULD
LAUGH AND LAUGH

06:59.000 --> 07:01.633
AND LAUGH.

07:01.633 --> 07:04.567
- WE NOTICED
YOUR LIGHTS WERE ON.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.367
- OH, YOU GUYS, GUESS WHAT.
- WHAT?

07:06.367 --> 07:10.200
- ROBERT SIGNED
WITH A MODELING AGENT.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.867
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S THE PUNCH LINE?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.100
- NO JOKE, DAD,
WILLIAM DENNISON

07:16.100 --> 07:18.000
OF THE WILLIAM DENNISON
MODELING AGENCY

07:18.000 --> 07:20.133
FELT THAT I HAD
POTENTIAL AS A MODEL,

07:20.133 --> 07:22.067
AND, UH, I'VE DECIDED
TO FULFILL IT.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.867
- OH, ROBERT,
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

07:25.867 --> 07:31.567
OH! EVEN AS A BABY,
YOU WERE ALWAYS A LOOKER.

07:31.567 --> 07:36.167
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS
MORE OF A "LOOK AT THAT."

07:38.167 --> 07:39.600
- NO, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

07:39.600 --> 07:41.967
I'M NOT GOING TO GO
FOR THE STEREOTYPICAL,

07:41.967 --> 07:43.300
BORING GOOD LOOKS THING.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.633
I'VE GOT MORE
OF A CHARACTER FACE.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.700
- LIKE THE WOLFMAN?

07:50.067 --> 07:51.600
- NO,
MAYBE MORE LIKE SOMEONE

07:51.600 --> 07:55.333
WHO GETS PAID TO REPRESENT
A MAJOR ASPIRIN COMPANY.

07:59.933 --> 08:01.800
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

08:01.800 --> 08:07.700
I'M GETTING
THE "MAJOR ASS" PART.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.033
- THAT WAS HEADACHE GUY.

08:10.033 --> 08:11.500
- STOP IT, RAY.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.333
NO, I THINK THAT WAS GREAT,
ROBERT. DO ANOTHER ONE.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.067
- NO.
ENOUGH!

08:15.067 --> 08:16.567
I DON'T LIKE THIS!

08:16.567 --> 08:19.933
I DIDN'T RAISE
NO MALE MODELS.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.700
- OH, FRANK.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.567
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I EXPECTED JUST SUCH A REACTION.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.133
GUESS IT GOES
WITH THE TERRITORY.

08:26.133 --> 08:29.333
THAT'S WHY THEY PAY US
THE BIG BUCKS.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.933
- THEY SAY HE COULD
POTENTIALLY MAKE

08:30.933 --> 08:33.300
$100,000 A YEAR.

08:33.300 --> 08:37.833
- [gasps]
- HOLY CRAP!

08:37.833 --> 08:39.033
SHUT UP,
PAINT YOUR FACE,

08:39.033 --> 08:41.600
AND START SWINGING IT
DOWNTOWN.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.533
- HEY, DAD,
YOU COULD MAKE SOME MONEY.

08:46.533 --> 08:49.433
YOU COULD BE
HEMORRHOID GUY.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.100
- MAKE ME AN OFFER!

08:57.100 --> 08:58.800
- NOBODY WANTS TO SEE
YOUR FATHER.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.767
ROBBIE, MAYBE YOU CAN FIND
SOMETHING FOR RAYMOND.

09:02.767 --> 09:06.067
THERE MUST BE A "CUTE
AND ADORABLE" DEPARTMENT.

09:06.067 --> 09:10.500
- HEY, ALL RIGHT, CAN WE JUST
ALL LET ROBERT HAVE HIS MOMENT?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.800
- NO,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DEBRA.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.500
I DON'T MIND SPREADING
MY GOOD FORTUNE.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.833
HEY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT, RAY,
I COULD INTRODUCE YOU

09:14.833 --> 09:17.033
TO MR. DENNISON
WHEN I PICK UP MY PICTURES.

09:17.033 --> 09:18.400
- THAT'S OKAY,
ROBERT, OKAY?

09:18.400 --> 09:21.367
ONE DELUSIONAL PERSON
IN THE FAMILY IS ENOUGH.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.900
- OH, ROBBIE! I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOUR PICTURE

09:23.900 --> 09:26.633
IN ALL THE MAGAZINES!

09:26.633 --> 09:29.767
- MAKE THAT
TWO DELUSIONAL PEOPLE.

09:29.767 --> 09:32.300
- I THINK
IT'S VERY EXCITING, ROBERT.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.167
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

09:34.167 --> 09:36.833
- AH...THANKS, AMY.
THANKS, MA.

09:36.833 --> 09:40.533
- SO THERE ARE A LOT OF
GOOD-LOOKING BROADS DOWN THERE?

09:44.733 --> 09:49.467
- DAD, PLEASE.
THOSE ARE MY COLLEAGUES.

09:49.467 --> 09:50.933
- YEAH, DAD.

09:50.933 --> 09:53.167
SO ANY OF THESE COLLEAGUES
SWEDISH?

09:53.167 --> 09:54.567
- UGH, RAY.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.867
- I'M INTERESTED
IN MY BROTHER'S LIFE.

09:56.867 --> 09:59.733
AND EUROPE.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.033
- OKAY, LOOK, WILL YOU RELAX?

10:04.033 --> 10:05.433
WE'RE JUST HERE
TO PICK UP THE PICTURES,

10:05.433 --> 10:06.867
AND THEN WE'RE GONE.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.233
- BUT WE'RE GOING TO SEE
SOME REAL MODELS, RIGHT?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.400
I DIDN'T COME
DOWN HERE TO SEE

10:09.400 --> 10:12.133
PMS LADY
OR LAXATIVE GIRL.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.000
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, JUST DON'T
DO ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS ME.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.567
- DON'T WORRY,
I'M GOING TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT,

10:17.567 --> 10:20.700
EXCEPT FOR WHEN
I'M GOING, "WOWEE!"

10:24.633 --> 10:27.533
- I MEAN IT, RAYMOND.
NO GOOFING AROUND, OKAY?

10:27.533 --> 10:28.867
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME.

10:28.867 --> 10:31.400
- [whispers]
ALL RIGHT.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.500
NOT QUITE AS GLAMOROUS
AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

10:53.567 --> 10:56.067
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE?

10:56.067 --> 10:57.500
- YES, YEAH, YES.
I DON'T GET IT.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.467
YESTERDAY THERE WERE
ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE.

11:00.467 --> 11:02.600
AND--AND I WENT
OVER HERE TO SIT,

11:02.600 --> 11:04.900
AND--AND THIS IS WHERE
THE LADY WAS WHO HELPED ME,

11:04.900 --> 11:07.433
AND THEN THIS WAS
WILLIAM'S OFFICE OVER HERE.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.100
THEN THEY SAID,
"GO DO YOUR PICTURES."

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
I CAME IN HERE.
I-I MET HERBERT.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.367
AND THEN AFTER THAT,
I WENT OVER HERE.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.233
[speaks indistinctly]

11:14.233 --> 11:16.567
AND THEN I SAID,
"OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:16.567 --> 11:19.133
I'LL COME BACK TO GET 'EM."
AND--AND THEN I-I LEFT.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.433
AND I-I DON'T KNOW.

11:20.433 --> 11:23.000
- SO BASICALLY,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

11:23.000 --> 11:27.567
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
I'M GOING TO SEE TODAY IS YOU.

11:27.567 --> 11:30.733
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
EVEN THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GONE.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.500
IT--IT'S LIKE A CON JOB.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.600
- HOW COULD IT BE A CON JOB?
I MEAN--

11:35.600 --> 11:39.433
OH, DON'T TELL ME YOU
PAID THE GUY TO REPRESENT YOU.

11:39.433 --> 11:43.067
- NO, I ONLY PAID
FOR THE PICTURES.

11:43.067 --> 11:46.433
I PAID FOR THE PICTURES.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.767
- OH, MAN.
HOW MUCH?

11:48.767 --> 11:51.433
- $1,000.

11:51.433 --> 11:53.600
- $1,000?
ARE YOU NUTS?

11:53.600 --> 11:57.700
- IT WOULD'VE COST ME A LOT MORE
WITH ONE OF THOSE OUTSIDE GUYS!

11:59.233 --> 12:00.600
- OH, MY GOD!

12:00.600 --> 12:03.133
- I FEEL SICK.
- ALL RIGHT, EASY. EASY!

12:03.133 --> 12:04.433
- I CAN'T BREATHE!
- ALL RIGHT, RELAX.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.000
- I CAN'T BREATHE!
I CAN'T BREATHE!

12:06.000 --> 12:07.933
- RELAX.
ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN!

12:07.933 --> 12:09.600
ROBERT!
JUST CALM DOWN.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.567
- I CAN'T BREATHE!
- CALM DOWN.

12:11.567 --> 12:13.000
CALM DOWN!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.767
- HOW CAN I CALM DOWN?

12:14.767 --> 12:16.233
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

12:16.233 --> 12:18.000
I'VE BEEN CONNED,
AND I'M A COP.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.467
I'M A CONNED COP!

12:20.467 --> 12:22.467
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST

12:22.467 --> 12:24.733
TRACK THE GUYS DOWN,
AND YOU THROW 'EM IN JAIL?

12:24.733 --> 12:27.033
- YEAH, SURE, I CAN JUST IMAGINE
THE HEADLINES.

12:27.033 --> 12:31.200
"GIANT COP IS GIANT SCHMUCK!"

12:31.200 --> 12:33.767
- LOOK, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
THAT'S ALL.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.433
COME ON.
LET'S GO HOME.

12:35.433 --> 12:36.667
- NO, NO,
NO, I CAN'T.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.433
HOW DO I FACE AMY
AND MOM AND DAD?

12:39.433 --> 12:42.633
THEY THINK I'M A MODEL!

12:42.633 --> 12:46.433
- NOBODY THINKS THAT.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.533
LOOK.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.567
YOU JUST TELL THEM
THAT YOU DECIDED

12:50.567 --> 12:52.333
THAT THIS CAREER
WAS NOT FOR YOU.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.267
THAT'S ALL.
YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A MAN.

12:54.267 --> 12:56.333
- OKAY, BUT SEE,
THEY'RE EXPECTING PICTURES.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.933
I MEAN, AMY KNOWS
I-I-I PAID $1,500.

12:59.933 --> 13:01.600
- I THOUGHT
YOU SAID $1,000.

13:01.600 --> 13:07.667
- I LIED, OKAY, RAYMOND?
I'M A MORON!

13:12.167 --> 13:13.600
- ALL RIGHT, SO...

13:13.600 --> 13:15.133
WE'LL GET
SOME NEW PICTURES MADE.

13:15.133 --> 13:17.767
- NO, I CAN'T.
THAT WAS MY LAST $2,000.

13:17.767 --> 13:21.800
- $2,000?
- I KNOW!

13:21.800 --> 13:25.967
- WELL...

13:25.967 --> 13:27.600
$2,000?

13:27.600 --> 13:31.200
WHAT WERE THESE,
PICTURES OR SCULPTURES?

13:31.200 --> 13:32.933
- MAYBE I'LL JUST
JUMP OUT THE WINDOW.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.367
IF IT'S REALLY A WINDOW.

13:34.367 --> 13:38.033
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, DON'T JUMP YET.

13:38.033 --> 13:40.667
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT A CAMERA.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.300
SO--SO WE'LL TAKE
SOME PICTURES,

13:43.300 --> 13:45.633
AND WE'LL SHOW 'EM
TO EVERYBODY,

13:45.633 --> 13:47.367
AND--AND THEN...

13:47.367 --> 13:49.533
THEN YOU QUIT
THE BUSINESS

13:49.533 --> 13:52.067
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY.

13:52.067 --> 13:53.467
AND WE'RE DONE.

13:53.467 --> 13:56.633
- YEAH?
YOU'LL HELP ME?

13:56.633 --> 13:58.533
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

14:00.567 --> 14:02.133
- THANK YOU.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.567
YOU'RE A GOOD BROTHER.
- YEAH.

14:05.567 --> 14:09.300
AND I'LL ONLY
CHARGE YOU $1,100.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.833
OH, OKAY.
YOU READY?

14:17.833 --> 14:19.033
- YOU MEAN THIS IS
WHERE WE'RE DOING IT?

14:19.033 --> 14:21.667
IN THE BASEMENT?
- YEAH.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.767
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK
LIKE A $2,000 PICTURE.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.767
- WELL, JUST STAND UP
AGAINST THE BACKDROP.

14:25.767 --> 14:29.833
IT'S VERY NICE.
- YOU MEAN YOUR BEDSPREAD?

14:29.833 --> 14:33.400
IT'S LIKE A PORN SHOOT.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.700
- JUST SHUT UP AND STAND THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

14:34.700 --> 14:36.400
WE STILL GOT TO TAKE
THE PICTURES

14:36.400 --> 14:38.600
AND GET TO THE ONE-HOUR PLACE
BEFORE PEOPLE GET HOME.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.500
- YEAH, OKAY,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

14:40.500 --> 14:44.267
I NEED A LITTLE POWDER FIRST?
- YOU DON'T NEED ANY POWDER!

14:44.267 --> 14:45.567
- OKAY, LOOK.
YOU KNOW WHAT--

14:45.567 --> 14:47.633
JUST WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT I WANT--

14:47.633 --> 14:51.067
DON'T TAKE THE PICTURE
WHEN I'M TALKING, RAY--RAYMOND?

14:51.067 --> 14:52.367
- WHAT?
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:52.367 --> 14:54.367
JUST PUT THE CAMERA DOWN.
PUT IT DOWN!

14:54.367 --> 14:57.733
- WHAT? COME ON.
THOSE ARE GREAT ACTION SHOTS.

14:57.733 --> 15:01.267
- I NEED YOU TO WAIT
UNTIL I POSE FIRST.

15:01.267 --> 15:04.967
- THEN POSE ALREADY.

15:04.967 --> 15:07.367
HURRY UP.

15:09.167 --> 15:12.400
- I WILL BE STARTING
WITH HEADACHE GUY.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.533
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

15:17.533 --> 15:21.033
- THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
JUST TAKE IT.

15:21.033 --> 15:24.767
- LOOKS MORE LIKE
JOCK-ITCH GUY.

15:24.767 --> 15:27.667
- I NEED THAT ONE TOO.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.533
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS NOT WORKING.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.600
- WHY NOT?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.133
- YOU'RE NOT BELIEVABLE
AS A PERSON.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.733
- OH, YEAH, AVEDON?
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:37.733 --> 15:39.833
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT HERBERT SAID

15:39.833 --> 15:42.567
I WAS A JOY TO PHOTOGRAPH!

15:42.567 --> 15:46.300
- HERBERT DIDN'T HAVE
ANY FILM IN THE CAMERA!

15:49.567 --> 15:52.567
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.167
I'M SUCH A DOPE.

15:54.167 --> 15:55.733
- HEY, HOLD IT.
THAT'S GOOD. RIGHT THERE!

15:55.733 --> 15:59.700
YES, THAT'S THE PERFECT
ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION GUY.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.567
- HEY, RAYMOND, DON'T, OKAY?
JUST FORGET IT.

16:01.567 --> 16:03.533
- NO, NO, IT'S GOOD.
YOU GOT A VERY EXPRESSIVE FACE.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.400
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.533
- YEAH?
- NOT THAT. THAT'S TOO HAPPY.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.267
WE DON'T WANT THAT.
- SORRY.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.700
- NO, NOW, YOU'RE FORCING IT.
JUST BE YOURSELF.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.833
THAT'S IT, RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT THERE.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.967
PERFECT. PERFECT.

16:15.967 --> 16:18.233
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. GIVE ME
A LITTLE OVER THE SHOULDER.

16:18.233 --> 16:23.333
LITTLE OVER THE SHOULDER.
YES!

16:23.333 --> 16:24.833
ANOTHER ONE.
COME ON.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.567
PERFECT!

16:27.567 --> 16:29.567
OKAY, GREAT.
NOW WE TRY A HAPPY ONE.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.500
GO AHEAD.
THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.767
- I GOT NOTHING.

16:33.767 --> 16:36.500
- REMEMBER WHEN DAD GOT HIS ARM
STUCK IN THE VENDING MACHINE?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.367
- THAT WAS FUNNY.
- YEAH.

16:38.367 --> 16:40.800
HOW 'BOUT WHEN MOM WAS TALKING,
AND THE MOTH FLEW IN?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.267
- KEEP GOING.

16:43.267 --> 16:46.433
- UH, REMEMBER
WHEN I ALMOST GOT FIRED?

16:46.433 --> 16:48.267
- YOU ALMOST GOT FIRED?
- THERE YOU GO!

16:48.267 --> 16:49.700
THERE YOU GO!
HOLD IT.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.333
- WHY DID YOU
ALMOST GET FIRED?

16:51.333 --> 16:53.633
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT DEBRA ALMOST LEFT ME.

16:53.633 --> 16:57.000
- YOU ARE GOOD AT THIS.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.767
- PERFECT.
PERFECT.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.100
ALL RIGHT.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.200
OKAY, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.533
- HERE WE GO.

17:05.533 --> 17:06.733
[disco music playing]
THAT'S IT!

17:06.733 --> 17:09.633
FEEL THAT.
FEEL IT.

17:09.633 --> 17:11.500
YEAH. FEEL THE MUSIC.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.533
MOVE IT! YEAH!

17:13.533 --> 17:15.733
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.
TURN INTO ME.

17:15.733 --> 17:19.533
YEAH! ONE MORE, ONE MORE.
TURN INTO ME.

17:19.533 --> 17:21.333
YEAH!
OKAY. NOW, YOU HOLD IT.

17:21.333 --> 17:25.467
YOU HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
AND I'LL GO. YEAH.

17:25.467 --> 17:26.533
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

17:26.533 --> 17:28.000
WHAT ABOUT THIS?
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.133
- OH, YEAH.
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.900
NOW WE'RE TALKING.
WAIT. I GOT AN IDEA.

17:32.900 --> 17:38.333
HERE WE GO. I'VE SEEN 'EM--
I'VE SEEN 'EM DO THIS.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.033
- [singing] BURN BABY BURN
- YEAH. FEEL IT!

17:40.033 --> 17:44.333
FEEL IT!
YOU'RE THE MAN.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.700
YOU'RE THE MAN!
WHO IS THE MAN?

17:47.700 --> 17:50.333
- I AM THE MAN!

17:50.333 --> 17:51.600
- WHO'S THE--
HERE WE GO!

17:51.600 --> 17:52.933
YOU'RE PROUD
AND MR. COOL.

17:52.933 --> 17:55.067
PROUD AND MR. COOL.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.300
PROUD
AND MR. COOL.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.733
OH, YEAH!
OH, YEAH!

17:59.733 --> 18:03.033
AND GO!

18:03.033 --> 18:04.800
WHERE ARE YOU?

18:04.800 --> 18:08.300
LOOK OVER HERE.
LOOK OVER HERE NOW, ROBBIE!

18:08.300 --> 18:10.733
ALL RIGHT.
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT NUDITY?

18:10.733 --> 18:12.800
- I'M FINE WITH IT.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.333
- I'M TALKING ABOUT ME.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.600
- [laughs]
YOU?

18:15.600 --> 18:17.167
- YEAH, YEAH.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.100
- HELLO, HELLO.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.033
- ROBERT GOT
HIS PICTURES BACK.

18:22.033 --> 18:23.767
- OH,
HOW DID THEY TURN OUT?

18:23.767 --> 18:25.733
- PRETTY GOOD, PRETTY GOOD.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.500
- I'M SO EXCITED.
LET ME SEE!

18:27.500 --> 18:29.267
- ALL RIGHT, HERE.
PUT THEM DOWN HERE, HONEY.

18:29.267 --> 18:32.500
FRANK,
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.333
- ALL RIGHTY.
- WATCH THE FINGERPRINTS.

18:35.333 --> 18:38.033
- YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:38.033 --> 18:41.000
- OOH...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.500
- WOW.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.533
- BOY.

18:46.533 --> 18:49.267
LOOK AT THOSE.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.433
- YOU DIDN'T PAY MONEY
FOR THESE, DID YA?

18:53.433 --> 18:55.167
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:55.167 --> 18:57.933
- WELL, ROBERT,
I THINK YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME,

18:57.933 --> 19:00.533
BUT THESE PICTURES
ARE KIND OF...

19:00.533 --> 19:02.567
LOUSY.

19:02.567 --> 19:03.800
- WHAT?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.000
- I AGREE WITH AMY.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.667
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL BOY,
ROBBIE,

19:06.667 --> 19:09.767
AND--AND THESE PHOTOS
DON'T DO YOU JUSTICE.

19:09.767 --> 19:11.233
- AND THEY'RE KIND OF
OUT OF FOCUS.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.633
- THEY'RE NOT OUT OF FOCUS.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.500
SHOW ME, SHOW ME
WHERE THEY'RE OUT OF FOCUS.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.133
YOU KNOW, IN FACT, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY,

19:16.133 --> 19:19.067
BUT THESE ARE THE BEST PICTURES
I'VE EVER SEEN.

19:19.067 --> 19:22.667
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
THE TOP OF HIS HEAD'S CUT OFF.

19:22.667 --> 19:27.433
- THEY'RE GOING FOR SOMETHING.
OPEN YOUR MIND!

19:27.433 --> 19:30.933
- OPEN THE TRASH,
AND THROW THESE IN.

19:30.933 --> 19:32.567
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:32.567 --> 19:35.500
- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I'M GLAD THAT YOU FEEL THIS WAY

19:35.500 --> 19:37.333
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

19:37.333 --> 19:39.767
I'M LEANING TOWARDS
NOT PURSUING THIS ANYMORE.

19:39.767 --> 19:41.667
- OH...
- WHAT? WHY? NO.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.567
- WELL, I REALLY CAN'T
PUT MY FINGER ON IT,

19:43.567 --> 19:47.600
BUT I THINK THAT THIS AGENCY
MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT FOR ME.

19:47.600 --> 19:52.433
- WELL, THEY CERTAINLY SET YOU
UP WITH A BAD PHOTOGRAPHER.

19:52.433 --> 19:56.200
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY GAVE
THE CAMERA TO A MONKEY.

19:57.967 --> 20:00.833
- ENOUGH!

20:00.833 --> 20:02.500
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.000
- YOU PEOPLE!

20:04.000 --> 20:08.133
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GOT TO RUN
DOWN ROBERT AND HIS DREAMS?

20:08.133 --> 20:10.300
NO.
NO, THAT'S OKAY, RAYMOND.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.700
THIS IS ACTUALLY
WHAT I WANT.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.767
- NO. NO, ROBERT.
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.833
GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

20:15.833 --> 20:19.500
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE FAMILY IS
SO NEGATIVE, AND I'M SICK OF IT!

20:19.500 --> 20:23.267
- IT'S NOT HIM.
IT'S THE PHOTOS.

20:23.267 --> 20:25.633
- IT'S YOU!

20:25.633 --> 20:30.067
AND YOU...AND YOU, AND YOU,
AND EVEN YOU!

20:30.067 --> 20:32.600
- YOU'RE LOSING ME, MAN.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.600
- ALL OF YOU,
YOU'RE GIVER-UPPERS

20:34.600 --> 20:35.833
AND PUT-ER-DOWNERS.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.800
- RAY, WHERE YOU GOING?

20:37.800 --> 20:39.333
- I KNOW SOME SPORTS PEOPLE,

20:39.333 --> 20:40.600
AND THEY DO SOME MODELING,
AND THEY HAVE SOME AGENTS,

20:40.600 --> 20:42.200
AND I'D LIKE
A SECOND OPINION, OKAY?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.000
SO YOU CAN ALL JUST STAY HERE

20:44.000 --> 20:46.167
IN YOUR LITTLE SUBURBAN
SUBURBIA,

20:46.167 --> 20:50.367
WHERE EVERYTHING IS IN FOCUS
AND NOBODY'S HEAD IS CUT OFF!

20:58.533 --> 21:02.300
- RAYMOND REALLY BELIEVES
IN ME.

21:06.367 --> 21:08.467
- [singing]
BURN BABY BURN

21:08.467 --> 21:11.500
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:11.500 --> 21:15.433
I DON'T KNOW THIS MAN.
I DON'T KNOW THIS MAN!

21:15.433 --> 21:18.233
OOH, YOU'RE FLYING
IN THE COOL JET.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.200
LOOK OUT.
LOOK OUT.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.833
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

21:21.833 --> 21:23.300
- WHAT'D I DO?

21:23.300 --> 21:25.200
- I'LL TELL YOU--
YOU STOLE.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.400
- WHAT'D I DO?

21:26.400 --> 21:28.567
