<i>This whole sheriff thing</i>
<i>you're doing...</i>

00:03.245 --> 00:05.420
If you go down, we both
end up on Rabbit's radar.

00:05.445 --> 00:06.694
Well, I guess we're
in it together, then.

00:06.719 --> 00:07.710
I want in.

00:07.735 --> 00:09.357
You have a particular
skill set?

00:09.382 --> 00:11.193
You mean aside
from saving your ass?

00:11.218 --> 00:12.511
Shut the fuck up.

00:12.803 --> 00:13.849
I'm Siobhan Kelly.

00:13.874 --> 00:14.873
You're under arrest.

00:14.898 --> 00:15.778
Who did I kill?

00:15.803 --> 00:16.982
Christopher Hanson.

00:18.038 --> 00:19.466
The Moody boys
are gunning for you.

00:19.491 --> 00:21.389
You killed their brother and
they're not gonna let that sit.

00:21.414 --> 00:22.254
I'm gonna break you.

00:22.279 --> 00:23.898
Break me?

00:23.923 --> 00:26.018
You have no idea what real
power is.

00:26.043 --> 00:27.772
Sir, it's
my daughter Rebecca.

00:29.856 --> 00:31.001
Very nice to meet you.

00:31.026 --> 00:31.764
You, too.

00:31.789 --> 00:32.378
What do you want?

00:32.404 --> 00:33.421
You better brace yourself.

00:33.446 --> 00:35.213
Here come the motherfuckin'
neighborhood.

- Yeah?
- <i>I'm at the county line.</i>

03:49.513 --> 03:51.314
<i>17 minutes since they</i>
<i>got off 80.</i>

03:51.348 --> 03:53.582
<i>You should have them</i>
<i>in about 30 seconds.</i>

03:53.617 --> 03:55.718
- No stops?
- Same route four days running.

03:55.752 --> 03:58.120
Does this entire town
smell like cow shit?

03:58.155 --> 04:00.524
Yeah, you got to
stay upwind.

04:04.929 --> 04:06.798
Okay, I have 'em.

04:09.101 --> 04:12.137
And they're waiting.

04:17.243 --> 04:18.810
And there he is.

04:18.845 --> 04:21.647
<i>- The old man?</i>
<i>- And the son. Same drill.</i>

04:21.680 --> 04:25.317
Sounds like somebody
got micromanagement issues.

04:29.422 --> 04:31.723
Wherever we do hit them,
it won't be here.

04:31.758 --> 04:34.893
Baby, before they see you
is always your best bet.

04:34.928 --> 04:36.157
Not with all that hardware.

04:36.182 --> 04:38.130
We're gonna have to take
them on the road.

04:38.131 --> 04:40.399
<i>Who the fuck is that?</i>

04:40.434 --> 04:43.870
That's Sugar.
He's with us.

04:45.539 --> 04:48.040
And when did we become
a motherfucking committee?

04:48.075 --> 04:50.977
- Did I miss a vote?
- You'll meet soon enough. Don't worry.

04:51.011 --> 04:54.280
<i>Sounds older than God and you call</i>
<i>him Sugar. Why should I be worried?</i>

04:54.315 --> 04:57.550
I'm sorry. All the other potty mouth
drag queens were busy.

04:57.584 --> 05:00.086
<i>Hmm, repartee.</i>

05:00.120 --> 05:02.288
How motherfucking exciting.

05:02.322 --> 05:05.224
Do you have any idea what it
takes to crack a truck like that?

05:05.258 --> 05:07.560
No, none at all.
That's why you're here.

05:10.363 --> 05:12.732
This sucks.
All right?

05:12.766 --> 05:15.267
Can't we go back to the city, man?
Any city.

05:15.302 --> 05:17.503
We could do a bank,
do diamonds.

05:17.538 --> 05:19.339
Something more suited
to our skills.

05:19.373 --> 05:21.274
This is a stagecoach.

05:21.308 --> 05:23.743
It's some motherfucking
Wild West stuff in here.

05:23.777 --> 05:26.546
<i>Hey, we're rebuilding.</i>
<i>Raising capital.</i>

05:26.580 --> 05:28.848
- We're slumming.
- You wanted in, Job.

05:28.882 --> 05:30.884
<i>Only because</i>
<i>I had to torch my salon</i>

05:30.918 --> 05:32.986
thanks to <i>you,</i>
motherfucker.

05:33.020 --> 05:35.522
Cost of doing business.

05:40.761 --> 05:43.230
Fuck you.

05:43.264 --> 05:46.400
Fuck each
and every one of you.

05:53.141 --> 05:54.608
- There you go.
- Thank you.

05:57.679 --> 05:59.913
Come on.
Let's go, you guys.

05:59.948 --> 06:01.715
- Don't fall behind.
- Hurry up!

06:05.487 --> 06:08.021
Hey, Mom. Why do they
wear those masks?

06:08.089 --> 06:09.523
They're banshee masks.

06:09.557 --> 06:11.726
The evil spirit
of a murdered Kinaho bride.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.695
- Deva.
- What, Mom? He can take it.

06:13.729 --> 06:15.930
Yeah, Mom,
I can take it.

06:15.964 --> 06:18.466
- It's just a legend.
- What's the legend?

06:18.500 --> 06:20.635
<i>Just that the spirit</i>
<i>of the murdered Kinaho bride</i>

06:20.670 --> 06:23.037
stayed behind to haunt
the white men who killed her.

06:23.072 --> 06:25.673
So naturally we turned
it into a festival.

06:25.708 --> 06:29.243
That is one
sweet-ass MILF.

06:29.278 --> 06:31.345
- Fuck off, douchebag.
- Deva!

06:31.380 --> 06:32.881
What?
They're being assholes.

06:32.915 --> 06:34.583
Yes, and we don't need
to encourage them.

06:45.527 --> 06:48.763
- Here you go, Mrs. Moody.
- Thank you.

06:48.798 --> 06:50.465
- Their pies are so good.
- Yeah.

06:52.334 --> 06:56.104
Hi. Last year you had some
terrific peach cobbler.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.476
<i>- How much?</i>
<i>- $5.</i>

07:08.985 --> 07:11.119
<i>Only 20</i>
<i>and she's had problems.</i>

07:22.498 --> 07:24.399
Mr. Proctor.

07:24.434 --> 07:27.703
Oh, hello, Alex.
Good to see you.

07:27.770 --> 07:29.872
Can I get you
a sandwich?

07:29.906 --> 07:31.273
Oh, no, thank you.

07:33.376 --> 07:35.111
I haven't seen Benjamin.

07:35.145 --> 07:37.279
My father's not feeling
well today.

07:37.314 --> 07:38.914
But he did hear about
your legal issues

07:38.949 --> 07:41.350
and asked me
to look in on you.

07:41.384 --> 07:42.985
You tell him
I appreciate that,

07:43.019 --> 07:45.320
but I fully expect the case
to be dropped shortly.

07:45.355 --> 07:47.923
Maybe so, but it is
a murder charge.

07:47.957 --> 07:50.659
So I'm sure
that you can understand

07:50.727 --> 07:54.329
that your involvement in the casino
expansion is now an impossibility.

07:54.364 --> 07:56.231
It's too much exposure
for us.

07:56.299 --> 07:58.934
I'm a silent partner,
as you like to point out.

07:58.968 --> 08:01.002
So I don't really follow
your logic.

08:01.037 --> 08:03.472
Banshee's a small town.

08:03.506 --> 08:05.640
These things have a way
of coming out.

08:05.674 --> 08:07.976
We simply can't allow
you to be involved.

08:09.278 --> 08:11.612
But I already am
involved, Alex.

08:13.082 --> 08:15.249
No.

08:15.284 --> 08:17.518
I don't think so.

08:17.552 --> 08:19.320
If that were true,
I'd know about it.

08:19.354 --> 08:21.588
After all, I'm next
in line to be chief.

08:21.623 --> 08:25.059
I'll give my father
your best.

08:35.937 --> 08:38.371
- Sorry I'm late.
- Sheriff Hood, we're just getting started.

08:38.405 --> 08:43.576
This is Special Agent
Dean Xavier with the FBI.

08:46.180 --> 08:49.849
What's the FBI's interest
in Kai Proctor?

08:49.883 --> 08:52.151
I coordinate with the DEA
and the Philadelphia PD

08:52.185 --> 08:53.619
on narcotics.

08:53.654 --> 08:56.689
Every few years, Proctor's
name comes across my desk,

08:56.724 --> 08:58.525
but we can never
tie him to anything.

08:58.559 --> 09:00.260
Now we've got him
for murder.

09:00.294 --> 09:02.896
Are you still going forward
with the grand jury?

09:02.930 --> 09:04.430
I am.

09:04.465 --> 09:06.466
Can't say that the case
hasn't been somewhat compromised,

09:06.500 --> 09:08.969
<i>but we've still got the victim's hand</i>
<i>and Webber's cell phone.</i>

09:09.003 --> 09:10.703
<i>Your case was</i>
<i>circumstantial at best.</i>

09:10.738 --> 09:13.139
Even with the eyewitness.
And now that you've lost him...

09:13.174 --> 09:15.609
The goddamn wall
was brought down with C4.

09:15.643 --> 09:17.243
Please, you couldn't
have done any better.

09:17.278 --> 09:19.446
I wouldn't have been there
to begin with.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.782
A roadside motel?
Seriously?

09:21.816 --> 09:24.818
Hey, did you come here
to piss on my department?

09:26.487 --> 09:28.422
I apologize,
Deputy Lotus.

09:28.456 --> 09:30.924
<i>I didn't mean to imply</i>
<i>that you were at fault here.</i>

09:30.958 --> 09:33.994
Yeah? Well, I was
the only one there.

09:34.062 --> 09:36.430
And that's why
I'm here now.

09:36.464 --> 09:39.734
Look, I'm sure you're all
very good at your jobs.

09:39.768 --> 09:41.102
Sheriff, you've been here
less than a month,

09:41.136 --> 09:42.570
you've got Proctor
by the short hairs.

09:42.604 --> 09:45.205
Frankly, the Bureau should
steal a page from your book.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.475
Is that why
you're here?

09:47.509 --> 09:49.276
To steal a page?

09:49.311 --> 09:51.912
Your lost witness

09:51.947 --> 09:53.881
raised some eyebrows
in my office.

09:53.916 --> 09:55.049
You know what?
This is bullshit.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.518
I've been sent here
to monitor the situation

09:57.553 --> 09:58.987
until the grand jury is in.

10:00.790 --> 10:03.992
You want to keep an eye on
things, that's your business.

10:04.026 --> 10:06.694
Just do it
at a safe distance.

10:06.729 --> 10:09.531
From what I hear about you,
that'd have to be pretty damn far.

10:12.267 --> 10:14.402
We're all on the same
side here, right?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.140
That it?

10:19.174 --> 10:22.377
Look, guys, this doesn't
have to be a thing.

10:22.411 --> 10:25.413
Yeah, well,
it is to me.

10:25.448 --> 10:28.984
Don't worry, Gordon.

10:29.051 --> 10:31.052
It's not.

10:44.167 --> 10:45.901
You believe this shit?

10:45.935 --> 10:48.537
Don't worry about Xavier.
He'll be gone in a few days.

10:48.572 --> 10:50.573
- Grand jury won't take long.
- Hey.

10:50.607 --> 10:52.875
You think
I fucked up here?

10:52.910 --> 10:54.443
I think we fucked up.

10:54.478 --> 10:56.045
And by we,
you mean me, right?

10:56.079 --> 10:59.415
No, we should've had Webber
on lockdown at the Cadi.

10:59.449 --> 11:01.450
- That's on me.
- So let's go find him.

11:01.484 --> 11:04.653
Whoever took out that wall didn't
do it to leave Webber alive.

11:04.687 --> 11:06.021
So, what,
we do nothing?

11:06.089 --> 11:07.922
You heard Hopewell.

11:07.957 --> 11:09.591
The physical evidence
is enough. We're okay.

11:09.659 --> 11:11.759
Proctor's out on bail,
our witness is gone--

11:11.794 --> 11:13.227
we're not okay.

11:13.262 --> 11:14.628
Webber got taken from me.

11:14.663 --> 11:17.498
You got rolled, Brock.
It happens. Shake it off.

11:17.532 --> 11:19.400
That the sum total
of your reaction to this?

11:19.434 --> 11:20.934
It is.

11:20.968 --> 11:23.337
- Shit happens, huh?
- Yup.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.175
Hello, Mr. Bates.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.110
How you doing there,
Mrs. Hopewell?

11:30.144 --> 11:32.679
- How's the cider this year?
- Oh, it's got some kick to it.

11:32.714 --> 11:34.447
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

11:34.482 --> 11:37.284
Mmm.
That's pretty good.

11:37.318 --> 11:40.287
Mom, Max wants
a buggy ride.

11:40.321 --> 11:42.356
- Oh, I don't know.
- Come on, it's a fair.

11:42.390 --> 11:44.358
I'll take him.
It'll be fine.

11:44.392 --> 11:48.496
- You have your inhaler?
- I left it in the car.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.999
Okay, you guys
go and have fun.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.600
I'll grab it
and catch up with you.

11:52.635 --> 11:54.636
Okay. Cool.
Come on, buddy.

11:56.472 --> 11:58.306
Nice kids.

11:58.340 --> 12:00.875
- Mr. Bates.
- Call me Sugar.

12:00.909 --> 12:02.477
Okay, I'll call
you Sugar.

12:02.545 --> 12:05.280
Listen, Sugar,
about the other night.

12:05.315 --> 12:07.383
Ain't got nothing
to worry about.

12:07.417 --> 12:10.119
I have plenty
to worry about.

12:10.154 --> 12:14.023
Yeah, well,
I suppose you do.

12:14.058 --> 12:16.059
But what I'm saying is

12:16.093 --> 12:18.929
you ain't got nothing
to worry about with me.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.133
Thank you.

12:24.769 --> 12:27.504
No.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.573
On the house.

12:37.348 --> 12:39.783
<i>Aw, she got
some treats for us.</i>

12:41.319 --> 12:43.988
Hey, is that our friendly
neighborhood MILF?

12:50.095 --> 12:52.930
Wait a minute, baby.
Where you going?

12:54.866 --> 12:56.901
Excuse me.

12:56.935 --> 12:58.122
You want to smoke
some weed with us, honey?

12:58.124 --> 12:59.240
Get out of my way.

13:00.339 --> 13:02.674
- You're making a mistake.
- Yeah?

13:04.944 --> 13:07.412
She put you down, man.

13:07.446 --> 13:09.480
Let go of me!

13:09.515 --> 13:11.716
- Get her over there.
- Fuck you!

13:11.784 --> 13:14.051
No, fuck you.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.426
- Get away.
- Come on, girl.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.728
<i>You don't want to do this.
Back the fuck off.</i>

13:23.762 --> 13:27.198
- Man, this bitch is in shape.
- Fuck you!

13:30.002 --> 13:31.569
I guess you picked
the wrong street to go down.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.405
Don't fucking move, bitch.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.341
What's going on here?

13:36.375 --> 13:39.244
Mind your business,
old man.

13:39.278 --> 13:42.513
What say we let this lady
join her children

13:42.548 --> 13:45.749
and I'll buy you all
some cider?

13:47.052 --> 13:50.487
I asked you once nicely
to get the fuck--

13:50.522 --> 13:52.756
- Leave him alone.
- Shut your mouth, bitch.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.627
All right,
let her go now.

13:56.661 --> 13:59.396
That's it, man.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.334
All right.
All right. No.

14:03.368 --> 14:05.469
No, no, no. I don't
want no trouble now.

14:05.504 --> 14:07.872
So, we got ourselves
a fighter.

14:09.541 --> 14:11.008
Are you any good?

14:11.042 --> 14:13.944
In my day.

14:16.714 --> 14:18.348
My companion Schroeder
here boxes.

14:18.383 --> 14:20.451
What do you say?

14:22.287 --> 14:24.688
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Get 'em up, old man.</i>

14:24.722 --> 14:27.224
Get 'em up,
motherfucker.

14:34.532 --> 14:35.899
All right, look--

14:35.933 --> 14:38.301
<i>Impressive, old man.</i>

14:38.336 --> 14:41.572
What do you say
we just let her go

14:41.600 --> 14:43.607
and we call it a day?
We call it a day.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.677
Sugar!

14:46.711 --> 14:48.245
Get back over here.

14:48.279 --> 14:50.247
Lie still, bitch.

14:50.282 --> 14:52.717
I'm not finished
with her yet.

14:52.751 --> 14:56.520
- Tally craves some intimacy.
- <i>Ow!</i>

14:58.357 --> 15:00.692
You sick fuck.

15:00.726 --> 15:02.627
Shh.

15:02.661 --> 15:05.530
- Relax, baby.
- I said get the fuck off of me!

15:34.360 --> 15:35.994
That man needs
an ambulance.

15:36.028 --> 15:37.161
We all have needs, baby.

15:37.196 --> 15:38.963
I'm gonna
fucking kill you.

15:38.998 --> 15:40.798
Yeah?
Maybe later, baby.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.701
But right now,
this ass is mine.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.541
Police!
Drop the gun!

15:52.277 --> 15:53.677
I said drop the gun.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.517
You okay?

16:34.552 --> 16:36.786
- Hey, is she okay?
- I'm fine.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.088
I'm fine.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.390
Jesus.
You look like shit.

16:41.425 --> 16:44.493
Yeah, I've been hit worse.

16:44.528 --> 16:47.029
Look, call Oakey, will you?

16:47.063 --> 16:49.565
The number's on the back
of the register.

16:49.599 --> 16:52.300
He can look after The Forge
till I get back.

16:52.335 --> 16:54.236
Sure. Okay.

16:55.738 --> 16:57.840
Hey, what happened?

16:57.874 --> 17:00.442
He tried to--

17:00.476 --> 17:02.143
he had a gun

17:02.177 --> 17:04.445
and she showed up
before I could take him out.

17:06.915 --> 17:08.516
One guy?

17:08.550 --> 17:10.318
No.

17:10.353 --> 17:12.354
There was like
four of them. Five.

17:12.387 --> 17:15.089
Sugar took out two before
this other guy showed up.

17:15.124 --> 17:17.759
Mom!

17:18.761 --> 17:20.462
Yeah.
Hey.

17:20.496 --> 17:23.832
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

17:28.204 --> 17:30.238
He had a gun.
He was on top of her.

17:30.273 --> 17:32.340
No, it's all right.
It's fine.

17:32.375 --> 17:35.176
It was him or you.
You're good.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.445
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

17:37.479 --> 17:39.247
It's just--
he didn't drop it.

17:39.282 --> 17:40.982
He was assaulting a woman.

17:41.017 --> 17:43.485
He was armed.
You did your job.

17:43.519 --> 17:47.222
Hey, none of us here would have
done it any differently, all right?

17:48.257 --> 17:50.358
Yeah, get her
out of here.

17:50.392 --> 17:52.593
Come on.

17:54.396 --> 17:56.998
I did a quick canvass,
in case you were wondering.

17:57.032 --> 18:00.067
<i>They all cleared out pretty
quickly after it all went down.</i>

18:00.101 --> 18:02.068
All right.
We know 'em?

18:02.103 --> 18:03.570
Yeah, they've been
through before.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.939
Itinerant, town to town.
You know, looking to party.

18:05.974 --> 18:07.874
We book one or two
of them from time to time

18:07.909 --> 18:09.910
on a D and D, they spend
a night in the tank.

18:09.944 --> 18:11.979
But nothing
like this before.

18:12.013 --> 18:15.583
- How do I find them?
- I or we?

18:17.085 --> 18:19.453
We can put out an APB,
but by the time we get a hit,

18:19.487 --> 18:22.189
they could be all the way to
Pittsburgh or out of the state, so...

18:23.558 --> 18:25.960
Let me know
if you get anything back.

18:27.095 --> 18:28.829
Will do.

19:19.849 --> 19:21.116
Fuck Tally.

19:21.150 --> 19:23.652
He decided to go for the
broad and he got burned.

19:23.687 --> 19:25.621
Now they'll be
looking for our asses.

19:25.655 --> 19:27.889
- Yup.
- That woman and the boxer guy,

19:27.924 --> 19:29.992
they can finger us.

19:30.026 --> 19:33.128
- Oh, bullshit.
- I'm with Biggs. We need to get gone now.

19:33.162 --> 19:35.063
We need to fucking roll.

19:35.097 --> 19:37.399
Listen to you guys.
We took an oath, man.

19:37.433 --> 19:39.501
- What are you talking about?
- Hey, fuck Tally.

19:39.535 --> 19:41.870
Will you shut
the fuck up?

19:41.905 --> 19:43.639
Just shut the fuck up.

19:43.673 --> 19:47.710
Tally went down for it and now
they're gonna be looking for us?

19:47.744 --> 19:50.346
Maybe so.
But Tally was our brother.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.214
He wore the ring.

19:52.249 --> 19:54.951
And all we have
is the road and each other.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.754
- That's it. That is fucking it, right?
- He's right.

19:57.788 --> 20:02.292
So nobody is going anywhere
until our brother is avenged.

20:03.227 --> 20:05.528
<i>Look, Tally is dead</i>

20:05.563 --> 20:08.064
and they're having
their little festival?

20:10.100 --> 20:11.901
No.

20:11.935 --> 20:14.370
I don't think so.

20:15.806 --> 20:17.674
- To Tally.
- Tally.

20:17.708 --> 20:19.509
- To Tally.
- To Tally.

21:13.965 --> 21:15.099
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:15.133 --> 21:16.567
How you doing?

21:16.601 --> 21:18.536
You know, just trying
to get this report done.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.604
You shoot one guy, they want
you to write a book about it.

21:20.639 --> 21:22.573
Tell me about it.

21:25.377 --> 21:27.845
I've never killed
anyone before.

21:30.315 --> 21:32.417
He had a gun
pointed at you.

21:34.086 --> 21:37.589
I know.
I know.

21:41.961 --> 21:45.531
Look, killing someone

21:45.565 --> 21:47.934
shouldn't be easy.

21:50.070 --> 21:53.874
But don't let that
make you doubt what you did.

21:53.908 --> 21:56.009
You won't forget
the guy you killed.

21:56.044 --> 21:58.345
That's yours.

21:58.380 --> 22:01.649
But don't forget
the woman you saved either.

22:06.187 --> 22:08.088
It's not just that.

22:08.122 --> 22:09.422
There's something else.

22:09.457 --> 22:12.258
It's like the way
she was fighting him.

22:12.292 --> 22:14.360
And then we found
his gun's clip ejected.

22:14.395 --> 22:16.829
I don't know.
It's like--

22:16.863 --> 22:19.432
it was like she...

22:24.037 --> 22:26.038
I got to head out
on patrol with Emmett.

22:26.072 --> 22:28.073
Why don't you stay
around here today?

22:28.107 --> 22:30.609
Let things settle.

22:30.677 --> 22:33.045
Sounds good.

23:28.471 --> 23:30.505
Fuck!

23:40.283 --> 23:42.784
- What happened?
<i>- A flat.</i>

23:51.995 --> 23:55.264
I only saw
one of them.

23:59.103 --> 24:00.837
Any idea where
they might be?

24:00.905 --> 24:03.072
No.
But I'll start looking.

24:03.107 --> 24:04.941
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay, I'm coming with.</i>

24:04.975 --> 24:07.076
No, that's not
a good idea.

24:07.111 --> 24:08.979
Well, I'm the only
real native here

24:09.013 --> 24:11.281
and I know this county
better than either of you.

24:16.687 --> 24:19.556
Hey. I'll go with Brock
to the festival.

24:19.590 --> 24:22.693
Stay in touch.

25:13.248 --> 25:14.781
<i>Hood, look out!</i>

26:25.918 --> 26:27.852
Hey.
Hey.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.922
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

26:31.990 --> 26:34.525
Please settle down.

26:34.559 --> 26:36.126
We'll settle down
when you tell us

26:36.161 --> 26:38.062
what you're going to do
to protect this town.

26:38.096 --> 26:38.754
Yeah!

26:38.779 --> 26:41.102
Everybody's gonna have
a chance to be heard, okay?

26:41.566 --> 26:44.201
They trashed my fruit stand.
Who's gonna pay for that?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.737
They haven't been arrested.
What if they come back?

26:46.805 --> 26:48.305
You need to cancel
the festival.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.441
There's no need
to cancel the festival.

26:50.475 --> 26:52.977
My office is going to be
processing any and all

26:53.011 --> 26:55.379
reasonable claims
of property loss.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.016
Look...

26:58.050 --> 27:01.018
Ladies.
Ladies, gentlemen.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.721
If I may.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.692
What are you
doing here, Proctor?

27:07.726 --> 27:09.160
You know you're out
on bail.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.930
And innocent
until proven guilty.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.300
Which is a good thing,
I must admit,

27:15.334 --> 27:18.403
considering how often our young
mayor here has me arrested.

27:18.438 --> 27:21.340
You all know me.

27:21.374 --> 27:23.509
And whatever
you might think of me,

27:23.543 --> 27:25.911
you know that I look out
for this town.

27:25.945 --> 27:29.181
My own business
was victimized today

27:29.216 --> 27:30.749
by those lowlifes.

27:30.784 --> 27:33.852
It's damn hard to sell prime
rib with tire tracks on it.

27:33.887 --> 27:37.756
But you know I'm gonna try.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.127
The Spirit Festival
is our hallowed tradition

27:42.161 --> 27:44.629
started by our
Native American brethren

27:44.663 --> 27:46.898
over 100 years ago.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.334
It now belongs
to all of us.

27:49.368 --> 27:52.570
And I'll be damned
if a few vagrants

27:52.638 --> 27:54.338
<i>are gonna ruin</i>
<i>our cherished event.</i>

27:54.373 --> 27:56.474
- Yeah!
- So I'll be at the festival.

27:56.542 --> 27:59.043
I'll be at the festival
tomorrow barbecuing

27:59.078 --> 28:01.412
as much free meat
as you all can eat.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.848
And--

28:03.916 --> 28:07.418
and I can assure you
that my own security personnel

28:07.453 --> 28:09.821
will be on hand as well.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.824
No, he's talking about hired
thugs with criminal records.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.060
I understand
that Betsy Denton

28:15.094 --> 28:16.929
was dragged
behind a motorcycle.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.198
That her jaw is broken
in three places.

28:19.232 --> 28:23.468
You ask me, we could have used
a few thugs out there today.

28:23.503 --> 28:25.637
Huh?

28:25.671 --> 28:27.739
Settle down.

28:27.773 --> 28:31.509
If you don't settle down, I'm
gonna have to clear the room.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.452
We've already taken
one of these guys down.

28:41.487 --> 28:45.089
If they come back,
we'll be ready for them.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.891
Yeah, you and what army?

28:46.925 --> 28:49.093
Two deputies
and the cheerleader?

28:50.629 --> 28:52.897
- What's your name?
- George Gutterson.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.166
Yeah, well, George, why
don't you shut your mouth?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.270
The festival stays on.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.740
What happened today
will not happen again.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.508
They have you
outnumbered.

29:03.543 --> 29:04.843
<i>It's true.</i>

29:07.247 --> 29:09.415
Well, I'll tell you
what, Mr. Proctor,

29:09.449 --> 29:12.184
I won't tell you how
to slit a cow's throat,

29:12.218 --> 29:14.586
you don't tell me
how to police this town.

29:19.226 --> 29:20.860
Fair enough.

29:25.466 --> 29:27.600
The festival stays on.

29:38.146 --> 29:39.546
- I'll be at the Cadi.
- Yeah.

29:39.581 --> 29:40.881
Emmett, follow her home.

29:40.916 --> 29:43.050
For Christ's sake, boss.
I'm an armed deputy.

29:43.084 --> 29:45.652
Yeah, good point.
Emmett, follow her home.

29:46.888 --> 29:49.724
- Sheriff Hood.
- Yeah?

29:49.758 --> 29:52.226
<i>Sprechen sie.</i>

29:52.261 --> 29:54.762
Oh, hey.

29:54.797 --> 29:56.664
Sheriff Hood,

29:56.698 --> 29:58.566
I attacked a man
in town today,

29:58.600 --> 30:01.002
one of the bikers,
with this.

30:01.036 --> 30:03.071
Give it to him.

30:11.816 --> 30:14.451
You stabbed one of them?

30:14.485 --> 30:18.221
I'm ready to face the legal
consequences of my actions.

30:22.094 --> 30:24.128
What, are you serious?
She was defending herself.

30:24.163 --> 30:27.031
No, that is not for us to decide.
You are the lawman.

30:27.066 --> 30:28.533
Okay, well,
consider it decided.

30:28.567 --> 30:30.902
No, you keep that.

30:32.839 --> 30:35.006
Come.

31:19.049 --> 31:21.317
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:21.351 --> 31:23.619
You checking up on me?

31:23.653 --> 31:26.121
Nope, I came to get you.

31:26.155 --> 31:28.023
You shouldn't stay here.

31:28.058 --> 31:30.626
Are you kidding me?

31:30.661 --> 31:32.595
What, do I have
a curfew now, too?

31:32.629 --> 31:35.364
No.

31:35.399 --> 31:37.900
Well, this is my house
and I'm not leaving.

31:40.237 --> 31:42.205
Well, I guess
I'm staying, too, then.

31:43.874 --> 31:45.942
When the time comes for
you to spend the night,

31:45.976 --> 31:47.910
it won't be to protect me.

31:59.389 --> 32:01.657
You can let yourself
out now, boss.

32:06.363 --> 32:10.065
I'll have the deputies
pass by throughout the night.

32:10.099 --> 32:12.267
You got a deputy
right here.

32:16.205 --> 32:18.373
Okay.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.176
<i>I guess you could give me</i>

32:21.211 --> 32:23.312
<i>a quick call</i>
<i>before you turn in.</i>

32:23.346 --> 32:25.614
I'll be up.

32:25.648 --> 32:27.983
Sure.

32:34.491 --> 32:37.059
<i>Nurse Davis to Pharmacology.</i>

32:37.093 --> 32:39.361
<i>Nurse Davis</i>
<i>to Pharmacology.</i>

32:49.472 --> 32:51.707
Hey.

32:55.478 --> 32:57.513
How you feeling?

32:59.516 --> 33:03.518
I feel like I've been hit in the
back of the head with a damn stick.

33:09.659 --> 33:11.793
I'm gonna
fucking find them.

33:11.828 --> 33:14.763
No, no.
Let it go, man.

33:15.932 --> 33:19.534
Guys like us,
we get hit sometimes.

33:19.569 --> 33:22.871
You go trying to settle
accounts for every cheap shot,

33:22.906 --> 33:25.274
you'll never get any sleep.

33:26.643 --> 33:29.011
What, do you have
a speech for everything?

33:29.045 --> 33:31.547
I'm a bartender.

33:31.581 --> 33:35.183
Wisdom is
an occupational hazard.

33:44.961 --> 33:47.262
Well, I'll let you
get some rest.

33:47.296 --> 33:49.531
Hey.

33:49.565 --> 33:53.301
I don't suppose you're
gonna take my advice.

33:56.471 --> 33:58.805
That would make us
both wise.

34:00.308 --> 34:02.342
Where's the fun in that?

34:06.013 --> 34:09.416
Yeah.
Hmm.

35:05.408 --> 35:07.743
Hey.

35:13.949 --> 35:16.418
That's a good look
for you.

35:18.087 --> 35:20.422
I want my knife back.

35:56.058 --> 35:57.926
Hey.

36:38.635 --> 36:40.903
You bastards!

36:45.909 --> 36:49.044
Motherfuckers!

36:57.186 --> 36:58.887
No!

36:58.955 --> 37:00.956
God damn it!

37:00.990 --> 37:03.225
No!

37:07.964 --> 37:10.432
No!

37:22.645 --> 37:25.980
No!

37:26.015 --> 37:28.350
Fuck you.

37:28.418 --> 37:30.686
Fuck you!

37:31.654 --> 37:34.056
You motherfuckers!

37:34.090 --> 37:36.291
Fucking kill you!

38:16.536 --> 38:18.537
So those elders--

38:18.605 --> 38:20.605
your father--

38:20.640 --> 38:23.375
they wanted me
to arrest you.

38:25.545 --> 38:27.446
I wish you had.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.749
Now I have to openly repent
or I'll be shunned.

38:32.118 --> 38:35.587
For defending yourself?

38:35.621 --> 38:38.657
The knife was
kind of my last straw.

38:41.461 --> 38:45.564
"Turn the other cheek and do not resist
him who is evil, sayeth the Lord."

38:49.870 --> 38:52.271
My people don't believe
in violence.

38:57.812 --> 38:59.813
What about you?

39:01.882 --> 39:03.449
What do you believe?

39:12.961 --> 39:15.295
Well, I don't know
much about religion,

39:15.330 --> 39:18.031
but this right here
doesn't feel like repentance.

39:18.066 --> 39:20.400
It's not a joke.

39:20.435 --> 39:22.336
Fuck.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.548
Hey, hey.

39:34.551 --> 39:36.052
I'm sorry.

39:40.390 --> 39:43.927
It's like I'm trying
to be two people.

39:46.096 --> 39:48.297
I've been there.

40:01.611 --> 40:03.245
Yeah?

40:03.280 --> 40:05.881
So there's nothing she could've done.

40:13.222 --> 40:15.390
Fire Department's
got it under control.

40:15.425 --> 40:17.659
She's over there.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.802
You okay?

40:27.070 --> 40:29.572
What time is it?

40:30.707 --> 40:33.876
Um, a little
after 1:00.

40:35.813 --> 40:37.947
Today's my birthday.

40:44.655 --> 40:46.923
I was born in that house.

40:54.899 --> 40:57.434
You're staying with Emmett
and Meg until this is over.

40:57.502 --> 40:59.069
Emmett.

40:59.104 --> 41:01.105
Take her home.
She's staying with you.

41:12.716 --> 41:14.384
Hey.

41:37.107 --> 41:40.376
<i>I heard about
your deputy's house.</i>

41:40.410 --> 41:44.113
What are you gonna do about it?
What's your plan?

41:45.582 --> 41:47.516
Well, what's it to you?

42:05.669 --> 42:07.269
Where'd you find him?

42:07.304 --> 42:10.339
One of my guys spotted him at
a liquor store in Danville.

42:10.373 --> 42:13.275
<i>Did he tell you
where they're holed up?</i>

42:14.978 --> 42:16.945
He's been extremely
forthcoming.

42:18.348 --> 42:20.582
Hmm.

42:25.555 --> 42:27.389
So what now?

42:28.891 --> 42:32.027
You arrest these guys, they'll
make bail, stick around.

42:32.062 --> 42:34.663
I'm not planning
on arresting them.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.135
What's in it for you?

43:18.574 --> 43:20.942
You motherfucker!

44:30.346 --> 44:32.747
And where
am I dumping these?

44:32.781 --> 44:35.416
They got warrants
in Cleveland.

44:35.450 --> 44:38.018
- You sure they're alive?
- They're just sleeping it off.

44:39.220 --> 44:42.522
Oh, as requested,
Officer Paul Hibbert.

44:45.292 --> 44:47.693
Oh, no, it was easy.
Podunk cage like that,

44:47.728 --> 44:49.862
bitch,
took me five minutes.

44:49.897 --> 44:52.031
Uh, thanks.

44:58.839 --> 45:01.941
I am legit worried
about you, motherfucker.

46:04.839 --> 46:07.274
- Carrie?
- Hey, Marjorie.

46:07.308 --> 46:09.276
Honey, I heard about
what happened.

46:09.310 --> 46:11.912
- How are you holding up?
- I'm fine.

46:11.946 --> 46:13.380
Yeah?

46:13.414 --> 46:15.649
I'd hoped you would
have called me by now.

46:15.684 --> 46:17.918
I really don't think
you should underestimate

46:17.952 --> 46:21.054
the trauma that
you've been through.

46:21.089 --> 46:24.057
I really recommend that you
get some counseling or...

46:24.091 --> 46:27.561
I appreciate that, Marjorie.
I'll certainly consider it.

46:27.595 --> 46:30.664
Yeah, no, I just mean with everything
else you're going through.

46:30.698 --> 46:32.199
Everything else?

46:32.233 --> 46:34.768
Well...

46:34.802 --> 46:38.238
I mean, I heard that Deva's having
a little bit of trouble in school.

46:38.305 --> 46:41.174
- Skipping classes and whatnot.
- Where'd you hear that?

46:41.208 --> 46:43.576
Oh, no, sweetie,
please don't be upset.

46:43.610 --> 46:45.711
I mean, really,
kids this age,

46:45.746 --> 46:47.847
they live
to test us, right?

46:47.881 --> 46:51.451
My point is that these
are the years as moms,

46:51.485 --> 46:53.986
we got to be
at the top of our game.

46:54.020 --> 46:58.057
So I just don't want you
to sweep this under the rug.

46:58.091 --> 47:01.227
You know, the sooner a victim
of a violent crime--

47:01.295 --> 47:03.529
- I wasn't the victim.
- No, I know.

47:03.564 --> 47:07.066
He's the one that got carted off in a
body bag with a slug in his chest.

47:07.100 --> 47:08.801
And since you've been
so generous

47:08.835 --> 47:10.536
with the friendly advice,
here's some for you.

47:10.570 --> 47:13.572
If I hear that you
and your PTA twats

47:13.607 --> 47:16.575
have been talking shit
about my daughter,

47:16.610 --> 47:19.711
there will be more than
enough trauma to go around.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.585
Enjoy the fair,
Marjorie.

47:42.402 --> 47:44.303
- Were you just hearing them?
- Put it on.

47:44.337 --> 47:47.406
No, no, no. You're not
putting that on me.

47:50.410 --> 47:52.378
She's a great kid.

47:52.412 --> 47:54.547
Yes, she is.

48:30.018 --> 48:32.753
So walk me through this.

48:32.787 --> 48:36.190
How do a frozen hand
and a bagged cell phone

48:36.258 --> 48:38.226
disappear
from your evidence locker?

48:38.293 --> 48:41.029
Everything was here when I
checked out last night.

48:41.097 --> 48:43.332
I'm told there was
an authorized entry

48:43.366 --> 48:46.068
at 7:03 this morning.

48:46.102 --> 48:48.437
A security
clearance card was used

48:48.471 --> 48:50.672
by Officer Paul Hibbert.

48:50.706 --> 48:52.507
That's right.

48:52.542 --> 48:55.010
- Who is that?
- I have no idea.

48:55.045 --> 48:57.179
He's in our system
as an evidence officer

48:57.214 --> 48:58.747
with a clearance card
for this room,

48:58.782 --> 49:01.316
but I'm telling you, nobody by
that name has ever worked here.

49:01.351 --> 49:04.920
And I've been the chief property
clerk for going on 13 years.

49:04.954 --> 49:08.023
Well, then you would know.

49:14.697 --> 49:17.299
Hello, sir.
This is Special Agent Xavier.

49:17.333 --> 49:19.768
Yup, gone.

49:19.802 --> 49:21.803
It's no surprise, really.

49:21.838 --> 49:24.172
With the systems they got here,
all it took was a routine hack

49:24.207 --> 49:26.575
and somebody with the balls
to walk in and take it.

49:29.012 --> 49:32.281
Well, there's something in Banshee
that stinks worse than the cows.

49:32.315 --> 49:35.317
With your permission, I'd like
to stick around for a bit

49:35.351 --> 49:37.019
and follow the stench.

49:39.122 --> 49:41.123
Yes, sir.

49:41.157 --> 49:43.125
I'll keep you posted.
