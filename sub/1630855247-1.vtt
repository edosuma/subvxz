01:09:10.831 --> 01:09:12.768
You got to show
these kids you care.

01:09:12.835 --> 01:09:14.939
You got to show up
on the holidays

01:09:15.006 --> 01:09:16.075
when it matters the most.

01:09:16.142 --> 01:09:18.379
These kids are used
to people failing them.

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:19.983
They're used to people
never showing up.

01:09:20.049 --> 01:09:21.920
They're used to people
never doing what

01:09:21.987 --> 01:09:23.489
they say they're gonna do.

01:09:23.557 --> 01:09:26.395
The easiest way to break
that cycle they've created

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.631
is to show up.

01:09:27.698 --> 01:09:28.967
- What's up, man?

01:09:29.034 --> 01:09:30.403
JELLY ROLL: Robert Sherrill
and me have been friends

01:09:30.469 --> 01:09:31.839
our whole lives,

01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:33.577
met each other
through the juvenile system.

01:09:33.643 --> 01:09:35.113
We both always been
very passionate

01:09:35.179 --> 01:09:36.381
about the same thing.

01:09:36.448 --> 01:09:38.485
ROBERT: Hey, y'all, hey.

01:09:38.553 --> 01:09:41.258
Real quick while y'all eat,
it's Thanksgiving.

01:09:41.324 --> 01:09:43.095
We could be a lot of places.

01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:45.099
But we know y'all know we care.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.235
And we love y'all.

01:09:46.302 --> 01:09:47.505
I want y'all
to hear from Jelly.

01:09:47.572 --> 01:09:52.313
Jelly was in here
for years in B pod, OK?

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.321
Jelly provided this meal, OK?

01:09:56.388 --> 01:09:58.827
I want y'all to know that.

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:00.497
- Look, y'all, I'm not
gonna feed you the same shit

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.833
everybody else feeds you.

01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:04.404
I'm just gonna shoot it
to y'all straight.

01:10:04.471 --> 01:10:07.812
I spent my 15th birthday
in this facility--

01:10:07.879 --> 01:10:09.381
16th, 17th.

01:10:09.448 --> 01:10:11.619
Went on to spend my
18th, 19th, 20th, 21st,

01:10:11.686 --> 01:10:15.828
and 22nd Thanksgiving in jail.

01:10:15.895 --> 01:10:17.430
YOLANDA: All of the youth
here have been

01:10:17.497 --> 01:10:19.234
charged with something.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.905
It could be as simple
as a runaway,

01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:24.946
or it can go all the way up
to a criminal homicide charge.

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:27.483
Jelly was always
into something when he

01:10:27.551 --> 01:10:30.624
was in the detention center.

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:33.128
He had several disciplinary
reports written on him,

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:36.468
I'll just say that.

01:10:36.536 --> 01:10:37.872
JELLY ROLL: I felt like
I didn't have no chance

01:10:37.938 --> 01:10:39.141
when I left here.

01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:41.412
And I ended up going
through the adult prison.

01:10:41.478 --> 01:10:42.982
Never forget it.

01:10:43.048 --> 01:10:45.521
I can tell y'all what
you don't know about me,

01:10:45.588 --> 01:10:48.794
probably, is that I ended
up obsessing about music.

01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:50.831
I dedicated
my whole life to passing

01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:53.169
mixtapes out around town,
winning freestyle battles.

01:10:53.235 --> 01:10:55.507
I'll out-rap everybody
in this facility times three.

01:10:55.574 --> 01:10:58.680
I'll fuck them up bad.
It'll be embarrassing here.

01:10:58.747 --> 01:11:02.354
And then I went on to do that
and build a business.

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.992
I promise y'all, this
ain't the average gag, dog.

01:11:05.059 --> 01:11:07.665
Don't let anything
about my presence fool you.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.937
- They've really been drawn
to him, just hearing his story

01:11:11.004 --> 01:11:12.641
and knowing his story,
that he's been in here.

01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:15.412
When he walks through
the facility, they're like,

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:16.616
is Jelly Roll coming over here?

01:11:16.683 --> 01:11:17.985
Is Jelly Roll coming over here?

01:11:18.051 --> 01:11:19.154
I'm like--
[chuckles]

01:11:19.221 --> 01:11:21.793
JELLY ROLL: I know when
you're 15 years old,

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.130
it seems like it's all over,
and you'll never fix it.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.670
But it's failures
that make you great.

01:11:26.736 --> 01:11:29.107
You just fall and get
back up and go again.

01:11:29.174 --> 01:11:31.478
I came here twice and had
to go do the DCS thing

01:11:31.546 --> 01:11:32.781
before they
finally bowed me over.

01:11:32.848 --> 01:11:34.586
I didn't learn
the first two times.

01:11:34.652 --> 01:11:36.556
Please learn this time, bro.

01:11:36.623 --> 01:11:38.192
We gon' talk
at the adult prison too.

01:11:38.259 --> 01:11:41.064
Please don't let me see you
there in four years.

01:11:42.935 --> 01:11:45.073
- I play a guitar.

01:11:45.139 --> 01:11:46.776
- Are you teaching yourself?

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.755
- Yeah.

You can really play

I can't really play the guitar.

Not like that.

I can't play like that.

I'ma talk to them

If they'll let me get one,
I'll send it up today.

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.833
- He got her, like,
a really nice guitar.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.606
So if you just could have seen
her eyes when she opened it,

01:12:51.673 --> 01:12:55.479
it's just like, wow.

It's that kind of stuff,

01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:06.268
It's priceless.

01:13:06.335 --> 01:13:10.477
To be able to impact somebody

01:13:10.544 --> 01:13:14.518

01:13:16.287 --> 01:13:18.358
It seems like
something so simple.

But it's like
you know the part--

01:13:23.936 --> 01:13:26.709
the small part
that you played in it.

01:13:28.647 --> 01:13:30.850
JELLY ROLL:
Seeing that same stale gray,

01:13:30.917 --> 01:13:32.855
hearing these same charges,

01:13:32.922 --> 01:13:34.859
hearing the system's
still doing the same thing--

01:13:34.925 --> 01:13:36.729
there was multiple kids
that have been

01:13:36.796 --> 01:13:37.865
in there more
than nine months,

01:13:37.932 --> 01:13:40.837
a year, year and a half--

01:13:40.904 --> 01:13:43.710
was just so much
perspective for me.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:53.028
- I don't remember having
this much colored shit.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.966
I mean, like, what were
we thinking last year?

01:13:55.033 --> 01:13:56.334
- I don't know.
[chuckles]

01:13:56.401 --> 01:13:57.470
- What the hell is this?

01:13:57.538 --> 01:13:59.808
Is this even our stuff?

01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:03.048
- I can start wrapping
the staircase.

01:14:03.115 --> 01:14:05.587
- We can do these, yep.
JELLY ROLL: Fucking score, son.

01:14:05.653 --> 01:14:06.956
BAILEE: It's almost like
I do this every year.

01:14:07.023 --> 01:14:09.662
I'm a professional
stair-lighter.

01:14:09.729 --> 01:14:12.567
- You are a professional
stair-lighter.

01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:16.175
My daughter saved my life.

01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:18.478
She wasn't old enough
to even know it.

01:14:19.849 --> 01:14:22.153
- I started being around my dad
around the age of two.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.923
This was when he
was first starting

01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:25.527
to pick up his music career.

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:28.332
But nothing was
really working for him.

01:14:28.399 --> 01:14:29.902
He didn't have a stable home.

01:14:29.969 --> 01:14:31.071
So that's why I was never
in my dad's custody.

01:14:31.137 --> 01:14:32.541
I was with my mom.

01:14:32.608 --> 01:14:34.211
JELLY ROLL: Bailee's mother
made it hard on me at first.

01:14:34.278 --> 01:14:37.684
She made me go
to court to even see her.

01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:39.722
We never got
to build a relationship

01:14:39.789 --> 01:14:42.394
in the early years because
I was traveling so much.

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.735
We were doing 250, 300 shows a
year back then out of the van.

01:14:46.802 --> 01:14:49.274
I was a very
less-than-present father,

01:14:49.341 --> 01:14:52.113
not to mention I was drinking
myself to sleep in the back

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.852
of that van every night.

01:14:54.919 --> 01:14:57.323
Baby, we got lights
on the stairs, Bailee Ann.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:58.927
BUNNIE: I'm so excited.

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:02.233
- Yeah, I'm gonna
do it right here.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.505
JELLY ROLL: Bailee was seven
years old when her mother

01:15:04.572 --> 01:15:07.778
started really going downhill.

01:15:07.845 --> 01:15:10.751
Felicia has fibromyalgia.

01:15:10.818 --> 01:15:13.823
And she's always in pain.

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:15.426
I could see the writing
on the wall,

01:15:15.493 --> 01:15:19.836
that her pill addiction
was spiraling out of control.

01:15:19.903 --> 01:15:23.743
And then I seen Felicia end up

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:27.149
in a full-blown
heroin addiction.

01:15:27.216 --> 01:15:29.722
BUNNIE: He took me
over to Bailee's house.

01:15:29.788 --> 01:15:32.293
And when I walked in,
my heart broke.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.801
She was making dinner
for her two cousins

01:15:35.867 --> 01:15:37.169
that were younger than her.

01:15:37.236 --> 01:15:40.442
And it was a loaf of bread
with peanut butter.

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:44.083
I was like, we cannot let
her live like this anymore.

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:45.954
JELLY ROLL: And before
we could even make a move,

01:15:46.021 --> 01:15:48.025
the police called me and told
me that Bailee's mother

01:15:48.091 --> 01:15:51.833
had stole the television
of the neighbor next door

01:15:51.899 --> 01:15:54.739
and pawned it
at the local pawn shop

01:15:54.806 --> 01:15:58.412
and I needed
to come get Bailee.

01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:01.018
And I'll never
forget that call.

01:16:01.084 --> 01:16:02.855
It was the exact same
feeling I got

01:16:02.922 --> 01:16:04.892
when that guard knocked
on that cell door

01:16:04.959 --> 01:16:07.263
and told me I had a daughter.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:11.605
It was that exact same
immediate rush to action.

01:16:11.672 --> 01:16:14.979
And we went and got her
and got full custody of her.

01:16:15.046 --> 01:16:17.752
And her mother
ended up battling

01:16:17.818 --> 01:16:22.460
about a six-year-long
heroin addiction.

01:16:22.528 --> 01:16:24.565
Completely disappeared
from Bailee's life

01:16:24.632 --> 01:16:27.336
for probably four years.

01:16:27.403 --> 01:16:29.808
And she's sober now.
We're really proud of her.

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:31.377
But it was really rough
on Bailee, man.

01:16:31.444 --> 01:16:33.650
And it really helped me
straighten my shit out

01:16:33.717 --> 01:16:35.486
because I realized
how important it was

01:16:35.553 --> 01:16:38.258
for me to be there for her.

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:45.072
- Her mom was an addict,
and who was I to take her--

01:16:45.139 --> 01:16:47.644
us take her from her mom
and bring her into our house?

01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:49.414
And we're over here
just popping pills

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.884
and doing the same thing.

01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:53.188
What makes us better?
You know?

01:16:53.255 --> 01:16:55.527
I was just like, this is it.
I'm done.

01:16:55.593 --> 01:16:58.933
And I literally never
touched a pill again.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.473
- I had a very extra,
interesting,

01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:04.210
traumatic childhood.

01:17:04.277 --> 01:17:06.683
Bunnie did.
My dad did.

01:17:06.749 --> 01:17:11.391
They're very important reasons
in why my mom is in my life

01:17:11.457 --> 01:17:13.429
now and is sober.

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:15.299
As a teenager, I've moved on.

01:17:15.365 --> 01:17:18.239
And I've worked
through my childhood.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:21.612
But that doesn't make it
necessarily "go away."

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:22.915
It made me who I am today.

01:17:22.981 --> 01:17:27.490
And without that,
I wouldn't be Bailee Ann.

01:17:27.558 --> 01:17:29.695
BUNNIE: If we did what
you wanted to do,

01:17:29.762 --> 01:17:31.599
we would literally
be an antique shop.

01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:33.134
JELLY ROLL: You know how much
snow globes mean to me.

01:17:33.201 --> 01:17:34.503
Bunnie; I know.
You do love a good snow globe.

01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:37.343
- [laughs]

01:17:37.409 --> 01:17:39.748
My dream was to build a home
where my whole family

01:17:39.815 --> 01:17:42.353
could be at,
like my father did.

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.059

that's my only intention,

01:17:50.503 --> 01:17:51.772
is to get Bailee
