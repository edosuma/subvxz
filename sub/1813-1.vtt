00:34.133 --> 00:38.971
Today, I want you
to know something...

00:38.972 --> 00:41.974
That the general loves you.

00:42.075 --> 00:45.209
But there are some of you here...

00:53.052 --> 00:55.020
I want to show you today...

00:55.021 --> 00:59.291
what happens when you
choose the wrong side...

00:59.292 --> 01:02.093
when you betray Tonga.

01:03.195 --> 01:05.495
Bring me his wife.

01:08.068 --> 01:12.271
I want to show you what happens
when you don't listen.

01:15.241 --> 01:19.677
- No.
- Like this man here.

01:56.315 --> 01:57.349
This is how a genius plays.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.519
I'm like Jordan on the pool table,
understand? Jordan on the fuckin' table.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.989
You got me, Case? Watch.
Get your head out of my shot.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.192
Watch... Watch it.
No. No.

02:07.193 --> 02:10.529
All right.
It's cool, man. It's cool.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.563
You know I don't do
I.O.U.'s, right?

02:11.564 --> 02:14.399
Better have double that
stack in your pocket,

02:14.400 --> 02:17.226
or we're gonna have
ourselves a situation.

02:20.205 --> 02:23.042
You are a lucky motherfucker, Case.
That's all I'm gonna say.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.610
I got the same amount
of luck as the next guy.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.612
Just time mine better.
You're an asshole.

02:26.613 --> 02:30.416
It's your fault. You taught him how
to play the game back in Beirut.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.283
Sir.
Chief.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.418
- Jay. Case.
- Commander.

02:32.419 --> 02:36.021
You here for a game?
I already owe you too much.

02:36.022 --> 02:37.289
Come on, Chief. Double or nothing.

02:37.290 --> 02:40.025
I thought you didn't take I.O.U.'s.
I don't give you I.O.U.'s.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.627
Hey.
Where's the rest of the team?

02:41.628 --> 02:44.430
Well, the smooth dogs are
working on some frog hogs...

02:44.431 --> 02:48.233
and new guy's over there
soaking up some Steinbeck.

02:48.234 --> 02:51.335
Let's go.
All right.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.508
Is that Bubba?

02:56.509 --> 02:58.577
Top of his class at Little Creek.

02:58.578 --> 03:02.081
Bubba! You're about to get your
cherry popped in Africa, son.

03:02.082 --> 03:06.517
How you feel about that?
Ecstatic, Commander! Needs popping.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.556
You know, Case is the only one in
my fire team I allow to think.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.625
What are you doing?
Getting my thinking out of the way, sir.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.227
- Good. Let's go.
- Ready to go.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.762
<i>♪ This is my rifle this is my gun ♪</i>

03:16.763 --> 03:20.498
<i>♪ This is my rifle this is my gun ♪</i>

03:21.200 --> 03:22.368
Come on, Bubba!

03:30.610 --> 03:31.543
Hey, guys.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.712
- Ready to focus now, gentlemen?
- Always, Senior.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.215
The Navy only gave us
one speed, Senior: full.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.817
I'm sure these fine
ladies are happy to hear it.

03:38.818 --> 03:42.287
Get your dicks.

03:42.288 --> 03:45.323
You haven't killed
anybody yet, you prick.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.628
Let's go.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.530
So what's got everyone
hot and bothered, Chief?

03:51.531 --> 03:54.333
We got some bad guys
we need you to take care of.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.802
And a couple of good guys
we'd like back.

03:56.803 --> 04:00.172
Now, one of the Agency's
local assets in Congo...

04:00.173 --> 04:03.042
uncovered a covert
military training camp...

04:03.043 --> 04:06.245
with a distinct
Al-Qaeda signature.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.080
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.582
The asset and
her C.I.A. handler...

04:10.583 --> 04:12.785
attempted physical confirmation...

04:12.786 --> 04:14.153
but were captured in the process.

04:14.154 --> 04:17.456
We believe these camps engage
in significant arms dealing as well.

04:17.457 --> 04:20.392
<i>I'd just as soon flatten
this place from 10,000 feet...</i>

04:20.392 --> 04:24.863
but there's a strong probability that
they have our agent and his asset.

04:24.864 --> 04:29.435
Now, the asset is a local
informant... Zoe Jelani.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.137
French-African.
Born in Marrakech, Morocco.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.806
Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.475
She's smart, and she's a survivor.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.444
Her C.I.A. handler is Tom Seborn.

04:38.445 --> 04:43.382
He recruited her, and she quickly became
his most valuable source with HUMINT.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.716
Now, actionable intel
from Jelani...

04:44.717 --> 04:50.623
resulted in the takedown of several
major smuggling kingpins except one.

04:50.824 --> 04:54.827
We know he goes by the name Malin.
But that's all we know.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.695
We have no photos, no description.

04:56.696 --> 04:59.731
This guy's invisible
and a growing threat.

04:59.732 --> 05:03.569
<i>We believe he's supplying
this camp with weapons.</i>

05:03.570 --> 05:07.439
Now, the leader of this
camp is this man...

05:07.440 --> 05:10.142
General Japhet Tonga.
A major rebel,

05:10.143 --> 05:13.779
<i>figure in the civil war</i>
<i>wanted for war crimes,</i>

05:13.780 --> 05:18.217
<i>genocide and all that other</i>
<i>Anderson Cooper bullshit.</i>

05:18.218 --> 05:19.284
<i>He's a major asshole.</i>

05:19.285 --> 05:21.520
- What's his affiliation with Al-Qaeda?
- We're not sure.

05:21.521 --> 05:26.658
But he understands that zealotry plus
money equals power, and that's his god.

05:26.659 --> 05:31.630
<i>We are gonna quickly and not so
quietly take it apart for him.</i>

05:31.631 --> 05:33.699
I like dealing with you.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.234
You always deliver. Yeah.

05:35.235 --> 05:38.837
I want you to bring me
more people from abroad...

05:38.838 --> 05:41.807
I can do business with.
I can do it. No problem.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.142
Good. Good. Good.

05:48.914 --> 05:51.416
Your team will
execute an insertion...

05:51.417 --> 05:53.719
15 klicks from the target area
at exactly 0200 hours.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.456
We have a pilot with a commercial
chopper and local knowledge.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.757
He'll get you in undetected.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.358
<i>You will have U.A.V. support.</i>

06:00.359 --> 06:02.919
<i>Reaper will clear the perimeter
and provide cover fire as needed.</i>

06:03.295 --> 06:08.167
You will locate and extract our people or
confirm that they are dead or off-site,

06:08.168 --> 06:09.768
at which point,
you will exfiltrate...

06:09.769 --> 06:12.204
and our bot will render
the camp inoperable.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.507
- Now go do this shit!
- Yes, sir. You heard him.

09:17.756 --> 09:20.625
You hear Pac-Man on comms?
"Coming in hot"?

09:20.626 --> 09:24.629
Wish I was sitting on my ass
playing video games all day too.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.832

09:26.833 --> 09:28.934

09:28.935 --> 09:31.902
Keep it tight.
We go in two.

09:38.043 --> 09:40.177
Is that a pool?

09:41.113 --> 09:43.014

We're U.S. Navy SEALs and
we're your extraction team.

23:07.452 --> 23:09.954
- Can you please identify yourself?
- Zoe Jelani.

23:09.955 --> 23:13.224
- And this man?
- Seborn. Get me out of here.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.193
- Are you injured?
- I don't know.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.895
Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around me.

23:19.964 --> 23:24.901
C.I.A. gonna have a good time with you.
I'm gonna make sure of it.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.780
You set this woman free.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.348
You American pigs.

23:37.349 --> 23:41.985
I'll tell you this.
She is...

23:42.320 --> 23:44.021
Move back!
Move back!

23:44.022 --> 23:47.458
Sit in the chair!
Sit in the chair!

23:47.459 --> 23:49.726
Damn.

23:49.961 --> 23:52.762
Shit. Shit.

24:03.274 --> 24:05.675
<i>Oui.</i>

24:06.978 --> 24:11.816
They're gonna want to spend a couple of weeks
at least debriefing you somewhere safe.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.252
Out of the country, all right?
Chief, I...

24:14.253 --> 24:16.354
What the fuck?

24:16.355 --> 24:17.688
Dan, what is it?

24:17.689 --> 24:21.325
Uh, I think we got something.

24:21.326 --> 24:22.892
Excuse me.

24:23.861 --> 24:26.964
Vic. Let's go.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.500
I don't know what you did to her,

24:29.501 --> 24:33.703
but let's just say you got served.

24:42.079 --> 24:44.514
Reinforced door.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.955
Be ready for anything, gentlemen.
Copy that.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.657
Popping the lock.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.825
- When you're ready, call it.
- Sir.

25:01.365 --> 25:03.633
Blow the lock in three.

25:15.546 --> 25:17.113
Clear.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.654
That's some serious
fuck-you money.

25:23.655 --> 25:25.923
It's a good thing we're not
in this for the money.

25:25.924 --> 25:27.357
- Yeah?
- Yeah, good thing.

25:27.358 --> 25:30.295
Now why would the general
here have all this cash on hand?

25:30.696 --> 25:33.129
Sir.

25:37.068 --> 25:39.669
Those are troop designations.

25:39.737 --> 25:42.605
It's got every entry point covered.

25:42.606 --> 25:45.776
Whatever that is,
he's guarding it like Fort Knox.

25:45.777 --> 25:51.382
It's a mine, and he's been paid a lot of
money to make sure no one knows it exists.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.017
Question is,
what's he pulling out?

25:53.018 --> 25:56.154
Only two things come out of
the ground in this region...

25:56.755 --> 25:58.221
Copper...

25:59.123 --> 25:59.924
and uranium.

25:59.925 --> 26:04.495
I discovered this place while
tracking an illegal arms dealer.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.430
Malin.
That's right.

26:06.431 --> 26:07.665
We knew Tonga
was receiving weapons,

26:07.666 --> 26:09.767
but what we didn't know
is that he wasn't buying them.

26:09.768 --> 26:13.204
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.739
- Shit.
- He's working <i>for</i> Malin...

26:14.740 --> 26:18.809
who's been stockpiling yellowcake
uranium for a major sale.

26:18.810 --> 26:19.543
Sir.

26:19.544 --> 26:22.847
According to this, there's been a major
influx of activity around the mine.

26:22.848 --> 26:28.084
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.

26:28.986 --> 26:31.788
And how would you
know that exactly?

26:34.525 --> 26:36.092
Tonga.

26:37.695 --> 26:39.162
Sure.

26:51.609 --> 26:53.209
Let's go.

26:53.744 --> 26:56.881
You're bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.182
We've a patch-through.

26:58.183 --> 27:01.452
Case. I'm sitting here
with the C.I.A.

27:01.453 --> 27:06.857
<i>How solid is your intel on the
mine and this yellowcake sale?</i>

27:06.858 --> 27:08.459
Just over 100%.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.827
<i>All right. Here's the deal.</i>

27:09.828 --> 27:13.030
I will have no other resources in the
area, and we're obviously on the clock.

27:13.231 --> 27:16.065
I need your team to pull a double.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.503
- Sir?
- <i>At this time,</i>

27:19.504 --> 27:20.704
<i>I have no authorization...</i>

27:20.705 --> 27:25.643
for an extra team or air support without
confirmation, except for an extraction.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.914
Okay. Maybe I wasn't clear
about the yellowcake.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.615
It's the uranium type.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.717
Uranium's legally
mined in that region...

27:33.718 --> 27:35.553
and there are about
10 international agencies...

27:35.554 --> 27:37.855
counting every ounce
of yellowcake produced...

27:37.856 --> 27:43.160
<i>making damn sure what your intel
says is happening never happens.</i>

27:43.161 --> 27:46.797
So you can imagine the
kind of politics that we...

27:46.798 --> 27:48.898
Listen, Case.

27:48.899 --> 27:53.137
The guys in D.C. cried wolf about
this African yellowcake once before.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.139
<i>We both know how that turned out.</i>

27:55.140 --> 27:57.475
Yes, I do.
<i>Listen.</i>

27:57.476 --> 27:59.944
I need you standing
on top of that shit...

27:59.945 --> 28:03.547
smoking gun in hand, before
any of this is on the record.

28:03.548 --> 28:07.785
<i>Now, your mission is to confirm
that mine is producing uranium...</i>

28:07.786 --> 28:09.520
<i>stop the sale and
expose the buyer...</i>

28:09.521 --> 28:11.956
<i>and you gotta do it with
what you showed up with.</i>

28:11.957 --> 28:14.692
<i>You got better intel
this time, right?</i>

28:14.693 --> 28:17.962
That'll be a giant
pain in the ass, sir.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.096
I know.

28:29.740 --> 28:32.208
Consider it done.

28:34.545 --> 28:36.679
Copy.

28:36.747 --> 28:41.117
You're fighting a war.
This ain't a goddamn game.

28:45.689 --> 28:47.625
I got deja vu.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.860
That's a bag of dicks, chief.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.328
Sounds fubar.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.131
I second your fubar,
and I raise you a fugly.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.833
Hooyah.
Hey.

28:56.834 --> 29:01.003
- If it don't suck...
- We don't do it.

29:02.873 --> 29:04.708
What else can you
tell me about the mine?

29:04.709 --> 29:07.211
I'll tell you on the way.
I'm going with you.

29:07.212 --> 29:09.246
No, I don't think so.

29:09.247 --> 29:13.851
I'm the only one who knows this
area and where Tonga's troops are.

29:13.852 --> 29:18.054
You need me.
<i>D'accord?</i>

29:22.826 --> 29:23.694
Sir?
Yeah.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.329
Case on the line.
Thanks.

29:25.330 --> 29:28.265
<i>Listen. The C.I.A.</i>
<i>wants their money.</i>

29:28.266 --> 29:31.069
<i>Just bury it with a G.P.S. tracker.
They'll get it later.</i>

29:31.370 --> 29:32.469
Copy.

29:32.470 --> 29:33.971
Your sat phone is our only
eyes and ears now.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.106
No more direct contact
with the comms.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.207
Roger that.

29:39.043 --> 29:40.277
Good luck.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.679
- Collins.
- Sir.

29:57.261 --> 30:01.097
Lose this and we're
sending smoke signals.

30:02.666 --> 30:04.168
No pressure.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.969
We gotta bury the money.

30:07.538 --> 30:10.140
<i>- C.I.A.?</i>
<i>- Yup.</i>

30:10.141 --> 30:13.077
Just the dollars then.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.945
- Bubba.
- Sir!

30:14.946 --> 30:18.415
You gotta dig a hole,
bury all the US currency.

30:18.416 --> 30:21.284
<i>And put a tracker on it.</i>

30:21.785 --> 30:23.152
Sir.

30:23.354 --> 30:28.258
So we're here. There's about 25
klicks between us and the mine.

30:28.259 --> 30:33.096
This is the road. It's heavily
patrolled with Tonga's soldiers.

30:33.097 --> 30:37.769
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have
another general take over operations.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.703
So we go around.

30:39.704 --> 30:43.240
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.

30:43.241 --> 30:44.908
Nothing new there.

30:44.909 --> 30:47.443
Tell me what you know about him.

30:48.979 --> 30:50.781
Very little, unfortunately.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.117
We don't know if he's one
person or a network.

30:53.118 --> 30:56.387
But he's controlled the illegal
arms trade in Congo for years.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.722
Now he's moved on
to brokering uranium.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.024
No one knows his real name.

31:00.025 --> 31:04.728
<i>Malin</i> is French.
For "sly," like a fox.

31:04.729 --> 31:05.763
Yeah.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.297
Bubba.
Sir.

31:07.298 --> 31:10.668
We got two days of rations and water left.
Ordnance is the issue though.

31:11.169 --> 31:12.803
Rounds are down to 40%.

31:12.804 --> 31:16.273
Hey, lady.
Here. Take it.

31:16.274 --> 31:18.574
Ever used one of these?

31:25.916 --> 31:28.251
I'll take that as a yes.

31:30.854 --> 31:33.055
Let's do it.

31:57.815 --> 32:02.252
We need to follow this river
up east to get to the first pass.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.388
Let's take the boat.

32:04.389 --> 32:07.390
We'll take it quietly.

33:33.912 --> 33:36.012
Hostile, 3:00.

33:37.381 --> 33:39.648
Start her up, Bubba.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.421
They are stealing the boat!
They are stealing the boat!

33:50.994 --> 33:55.032
- Here they come.
- Cover fire! Cover fire!

33:55.033 --> 33:56.599
Go! Go!

34:13.516 --> 34:17.286
Dan, right flank!
Right! Fire!

34:27.063 --> 34:29.632
More hostiles, 9:00.

34:39.610 --> 34:42.545
Incoming. Get down!

34:42.646 --> 34:44.580
Watch out, Bubba!

34:50.520 --> 34:54.291
Turn around.
We gotta get Bubba.

34:54.292 --> 34:57.193
Over here, guys. Over here!

34:59.630 --> 35:03.699
- Guys. Pick me up!
- Come on. We can make it.

35:04.968 --> 35:07.971
Bubba! Bubba, hold your hand out.

35:07.972 --> 35:11.108
Bubba, give me your hand.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.143
Come on.
Pull him up. Pull him up.

35:16.246 --> 35:19.281
Come on. Move.
Faster. Faster.

35:20.517 --> 35:25.588
Fuck! It's a dead end.
Turn left. Turn left!

35:43.707 --> 35:46.742
Dan, Vic!
Right flank!

35:59.022 --> 36:01.323
We're dead in the water!

36:28.719 --> 36:30.753
Ah, fuck!

36:36.493 --> 36:39.261
Case, look out!

36:40.330 --> 36:42.099
The boat! The boat!

36:42.100 --> 36:44.468
Case, the boat!
Get out!

36:44.469 --> 36:47.503
- Case!
- Look out!

36:58.215 --> 36:59.615
Case!

37:00.283 --> 37:04.186
Keep moving.
Don't stop! Don't stop!

37:04.388 --> 37:08.257
Let's go. Come on.
Go, go, go!

37:28.645 --> 37:31.847
I'll cover you.

37:51.568 --> 37:53.002
Go!

38:00.777 --> 38:02.544
Dan!

38:06.817 --> 38:08.617
Dan!

38:15.560 --> 38:19.295
Fuck you! Fuck you!

38:21.164 --> 38:24.600
Fuck you!

38:25.602 --> 38:27.204
They fragged Dan, man.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.306
Jesus Christ!
He's all over the fucking place!

38:29.307 --> 38:32.274
Follow the river.
Follow the river.

38:32.576 --> 38:34.845
We gotta go.
I was supposed to watch him!

38:34.846 --> 38:37.681
Keep it tight.
It's not your fault, all right?

38:37.682 --> 38:39.349
There's nothing
you could have done.

38:39.350 --> 38:44.620
Now we need you, buddy.
Okay? So let's go.

38:44.888 --> 38:48.290
Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.527
Fuck!

39:12.816 --> 39:16.319
Confirmed.
The link is no longer active.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.589
We should assume the worst.
No, we shouldn't.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.491
Request satellite imaging
on that coordinate...

39:21.492 --> 39:24.660
five minutes on either side
of the signal fail.

39:31.668 --> 39:33.102
Fuck!

39:35.705 --> 39:37.174
We've lost comms.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.742
Dan had the fucking sat phone.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.677
We need to set up the 4-M.C. Comms?

39:40.678 --> 39:44.514
We've lost comms? What the fuck
about the man we just lost?

39:44.515 --> 39:46.316
Vic!

39:46.317 --> 39:49.952
Two, six, 10.
Shut your fucking cockhole, Bubba.

39:53.623 --> 39:56.425
You all right, Bubs?

40:03.466 --> 40:06.034
Let's take a look at this.

40:10.707 --> 40:14.109
You all right?
Yeah.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.512
You?

40:19.216 --> 40:20.749
Yeah.

40:20.750 --> 40:24.453
Here. Okay?

40:30.694 --> 40:32.461
Okay.

40:33.830 --> 40:37.166
It's not your first
time being shot, huh?

40:38.802 --> 40:41.603
It's probably not my last.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.574
I hope it is.

40:47.444 --> 40:50.946
Tell me if it hurts.
It's fine.

40:56.253 --> 40:58.754
Let's just fix that.

40:59.289 --> 41:01.089
Under here.

41:01.891 --> 41:05.661
Mmm.
Should do it. Okay?

41:06.630 --> 41:08.897
Thank you.
All right.

41:08.898 --> 41:12.501
Here.
That's good.

41:12.736 --> 41:13.703
What?

41:13.704 --> 41:16.406
You're dangerous.
You know that?

41:16.407 --> 41:18.774
You have no idea.

41:46.936 --> 41:49.638
Sir, we got some smoke up ahead.

41:50.540 --> 41:52.575
Let's check it out.

42:14.931 --> 42:19.669
- What the fuck happened here?
- Tonga happened.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.404
It's flamethrower accelerant.

42:21.405 --> 42:25.709
I guess from that same batch
of goodies those vz. 58s came from.

42:30.747 --> 42:32.915
Jesus.

42:36.186 --> 42:39.221
Why would Tonga do this?

42:39.823 --> 42:42.959
These people are no threat to him.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.627
They chose the wrong side.

42:44.628 --> 42:47.964
Throw a dart round here and you
hit a different rebel faction.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.632
What side is the wrong side?

42:51.368 --> 42:54.236
Any side but Tonga's.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.247
- What's he saying?
- "Die, devil, die."

43:05.248 --> 43:08.585
We're not here to hurt you.
We're here to help. All right?

43:08.586 --> 43:10.987
Hey, kid.

43:10.988 --> 43:13.689
Hey, kid. Kid. Kid.

43:13.823 --> 43:16.191
Look. All right?

43:16.760 --> 43:18.027
Jay. Put that down.

43:18.028 --> 43:21.897
Just trying to protect
what's left of his village.

43:22.699 --> 43:25.067
Hey, kid.

43:25.535 --> 43:28.671
Kid, come here.
Look. Shake my hand.

43:28.672 --> 43:30.939
Come on.

43:31.207 --> 43:32.509
Come on.

43:32.510 --> 43:34.876
Put that down.
Shake my hand.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.179
Hey.

43:37.847 --> 43:39.582
Hey.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.750
You all right?

43:45.922 --> 43:48.558
<i>For the last week, the
villagers saw a convoy of trucks...</i>

43:48.559 --> 43:52.996
<i>coming through the pass every
morning about an hour after sunup.</i>

43:52.997 --> 43:57.299
<i>- Convoy comes every day?
- Every day.</i>

43:57.634 --> 44:00.235
You're thinking
about hitching a ride?

44:01.738 --> 44:04.940
Fighting isn't the only
thing we're good at.

44:07.710 --> 44:08.778
Hey, Bubba.

44:08.779 --> 44:10.946
Sir.
Come here.

44:11.514 --> 44:12.482
All right.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.584
I got good news
and really good news.

44:14.585 --> 44:19.656
Good news is you boys have exactly
one hour to cop some Z's.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.592
Think of it as a mini vacation.

44:22.593 --> 44:24.194
And the really good news?

44:24.195 --> 44:28.531
Then we're gonna breach
a moving convoy...

44:28.532 --> 44:31.568
loaded with Tonga's troops.

44:31.569 --> 44:33.870
You're welcome.
Goddamn.

44:33.871 --> 44:37.372
Damn.
That's real good news.

44:40.877 --> 44:42.545
He's due.

44:42.546 --> 44:43.847
Fuck him. I'm due.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.882
Know what Dan would have said.

44:46.916 --> 44:51.688
All right. I better help the new guy with
the truck. He'll probably fuck it up.

44:51.689 --> 44:54.022
Fucking will.

45:12.775 --> 45:14.544
How'd you learn to shoot like that?

45:14.545 --> 45:19.981
When I was 12, I pretended I was a
boy and joined the army in Kinshasa.

45:21.017 --> 45:25.855
It was during the civil war, so there was
no training, no physicals... nothing.

45:25.856 --> 45:30.859
They just took you straight to the
battlefield with your own clothes.

45:31.294 --> 45:35.131
When they discovered I was a girl
I was already leading a unit...

45:35.132 --> 45:37.232
so they kept me.

45:42.872 --> 45:45.273
No. I don't buy it.

45:45.608 --> 45:47.076
What? Why?

45:47.077 --> 45:51.713
It's hard to believe you could
ever have been mistaken for a boy.

46:07.797 --> 46:12.334
So you said fighting wasn't the
only thing you were good at?

46:13.970 --> 46:16.004
It isn't.

46:28.985 --> 46:31.453
Come here.

47:04.420 --> 47:07.357
- So what's the M.O., sir?
- Give me a minute.

47:07.358 --> 47:10.826
Just trying to put
all the pieces together.

47:11.127 --> 47:13.730
Thinking we do
the Korengal Valley thing.

47:13.731 --> 47:15.031
Which one?
First one.

47:15.032 --> 47:16.899
I remember.
That got fucked up, right?

47:16.900 --> 47:19.835
Yeah, but it was a better plan.

47:20.136 --> 47:23.172
And I don't see any goat
herders around here, do you?

47:23.173 --> 47:26.241
All right.
First one it is.

47:26.709 --> 47:29.010
So what are we doing?

47:32.048 --> 47:34.850
How complicated is this?

47:36.152 --> 47:38.755
Extremely. Look.

47:38.756 --> 47:42.058
- The truck stops there, right?
- Uh-huh.

47:42.059 --> 47:44.292
We get on.

47:47.864 --> 47:49.264
Okay.

48:06.849 --> 48:09.152
Get down. You, you, you!
Go, go, go! Now!

48:09.153 --> 48:12.321
- Go. Go.
- Get in there. Get in there. Quick.

48:12.322 --> 48:15.490
Get on the floor.
Get on the ground.

48:25.301 --> 48:27.869
Okay.
Everyone in position.

48:44.754 --> 48:47.155
One, two, three.

48:51.928 --> 48:53.929
Let's go.

48:53.930 --> 48:56.132
We need to assume...

48:56.133 --> 48:59.235
some of the operators
are still viable.

48:59.236 --> 49:01.904
Rescue protocol should give
me at least one robot...

49:01.905 --> 49:04.307
start clearing some of the
bad guys out of the area...

49:04.308 --> 49:07.976
give who is ever left out there...

49:07.977 --> 49:09.345
some sort of sporting chance.

49:09.346 --> 49:13.316
Yes, sir. I'm on it.
Thank you, Collins.

49:13.317 --> 49:15.684
Never assume the worst, Parker.

49:16.986 --> 49:18.921
Never.
Sir.

49:18.922 --> 49:21.389
Even if it is true.

49:23.993 --> 49:28.831
I'm the new general in charge
here, so hurry up. Move it.

49:49.252 --> 49:51.553
Faster, faster.

49:59.061 --> 50:01.596
Faster, faster.

50:04.434 --> 50:07.302
Faster, faster.

51:46.135 --> 51:49.138
How long do we have
until this rat trap stops?

51:49.139 --> 51:52.174
Forty-five minutes,
an hour at the most.

51:52.175 --> 51:57.345
Carb up, fellas. There might be
some drama in the second half.

52:00.049 --> 52:03.319
Sir, I think
we got something here.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.186
Farsi.

52:04.187 --> 52:08.323
Those markings. Takavar.
Iranian special forces.

52:09.225 --> 52:11.294
Maybe we got the buyer.

52:11.295 --> 52:14.530
I'd imagine we're looking
at their good-faith deposit.

52:14.531 --> 52:16.666
Comms. Jackpot.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.968
Looks like it might be
a good day after all.

52:18.969 --> 52:22.337
Bubba, get your ass over here.
Stop fiddlin'.

52:29.612 --> 52:32.515
If we can get hold of CENTCOM...

52:32.516 --> 52:34.183
and let them know that
we're mission forward...

52:34.184 --> 52:36.118
they might not flatten the
place before we get there.

52:36.119 --> 52:40.222
- How's your Persian, bro?
- Fuckin' awesome. If it was backwards.

52:40.223 --> 52:43.359
Don't worry, 'cause all you have to
do is find a satcom frequency...

52:43.360 --> 52:46.528
and we can tap into
our own mission channel.

52:50.566 --> 52:52.568
Ticktock.
Come on.

52:53.369 --> 52:57.773
<i>California, please
take out all enemy hostiles.</i>

52:57.774 --> 52:58.997
Did that person sound like...

52:59.023 --> 53:01.744
<i>Four klicks to target.
Weapons are hot.</i>

53:03.347 --> 53:05.481
Shit.
They're taking out the mines.

53:05.482 --> 53:09.785
Without confirming the intel, it'll be
next to impossible to get that approved.

53:09.786 --> 53:12.188
How long have we been off-line?

53:12.189 --> 53:15.156
Eight hours and change.

53:15.157 --> 53:18.193
Ricks has probably
initiated rescue measures.

53:18.194 --> 53:22.798
But without visual confirmation or a request
from us, he cannot send another team.

53:24.433 --> 53:28.304
He'll be looking for the most visible
concentration of enemy hostiles.

53:28.305 --> 53:30.672
Get the low-hanging fruit first.

53:30.673 --> 53:33.476
He could put a bird in the air, clear out
the hostiles from the rescue perimeter...

53:33.477 --> 53:35.310
assuming we're still operational.

53:38.147 --> 53:41.050
So cavalry's gonna take care
of some bad guys for us. Good.

53:41.051 --> 53:44.687
We in the convoy full of bad guys,
numbnuts. Put your helmet on, Bubba.

53:44.688 --> 53:48.190
People, we have about 30
seconds to un-fuck ourselves.

53:48.191 --> 53:50.326
What are we gonna do?
River, 20 seconds.

53:50.327 --> 53:53.394
Hey, don't you think
we should confirm strike?

53:55.064 --> 53:56.698
Confirmed!

54:01.404 --> 54:04.405
- It's a hit.
- Confirmed hit.

54:07.376 --> 54:09.477
Everyone out!

54:34.471 --> 54:37.972
- Go in for a second sweep.
- Copy that.

54:39.842 --> 54:41.377
Incoming!

54:41.378 --> 54:45.780
- Move out. On me!
- Go, go, go!

54:59.295 --> 55:01.262
Bubba!

55:04.467 --> 55:07.368
Bubba, get out!

55:34.897 --> 55:37.633
- It's a hit.
- Roger that. Confirmed hit.

55:37.634 --> 55:41.604
What the?
Those are our guys.

55:41.605 --> 55:44.607
- <i>California, abort mission! Abort!
- Shit!</i>

55:44.608 --> 55:48.843
Goddamn it!
We got a goddamn situation here!

56:26.215 --> 56:29.785
Come on, Bubs. I got you.

56:29.786 --> 56:32.288
Stay with me, man. Stay with me.

56:32.289 --> 56:34.922
Come on.

56:34.924 --> 56:36.959
- Get down here!
- Cover me. I'm going in.

56:36.960 --> 56:40.930
Help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

56:40.931 --> 56:42.731
He's still breathing.

56:42.732 --> 56:44.767
I got him.
We got you, Bubs.

56:44.768 --> 56:47.568
One, two, three.

56:49.271 --> 56:51.440
- Get his hand grenades.
- Pull his vest off.

56:51.441 --> 56:55.710
All right. Gun over.
Watch his face. Gun over.

56:55.711 --> 57:00.014
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Over his face.

57:00.816 --> 57:02.918
- Open him up.
- Vic!

57:03.419 --> 57:05.821
Jam as much of that in
the wound as possible.

57:05.847 --> 57:06.447
Gauze.

57:06.523 --> 57:10.559
Easy, Bubs. Easy.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.661
Easy. You're okay.

57:12.662 --> 57:15.696
Easy.

57:16.699 --> 57:18.601
You're all right, buddy.

57:18.602 --> 57:22.705
Look at me. Look at me.
You're all right.

57:22.706 --> 57:26.775
Bubba, look at me.
Just breathe. Take it easy.

57:28.612 --> 57:29.778
Just keep breathing.

57:29.779 --> 57:32.948
Does this hole qualify me
for the good shit, sir?

57:32.949 --> 57:35.149
Close enough.

57:39.688 --> 57:42.657
You're all right.
It's okay, kid.

57:44.059 --> 57:47.363
Let's tie this off.
Let's get that shirt off. Come on.

57:47.364 --> 57:48.831
Up you go, Bubs.

57:48.832 --> 57:50.866
- Get him on his feet.
- There you go.

57:50.867 --> 57:53.869
Getting some color back.

57:53.870 --> 57:55.738
You're blushing.

57:55.739 --> 57:59.807
- Here you go.
- Just tie it off.

58:02.077 --> 58:06.214
All right. On three.
One, two, three.

58:08.284 --> 58:09.817
Hey.

58:11.353 --> 58:13.721
All right, look at me.

58:15.557 --> 58:18.860
Are you doing good?
Sir.

58:19.361 --> 58:21.697
Sorry about the truck, sir.

58:21.698 --> 58:24.098
Don't mention it.

58:31.707 --> 58:33.174
Come on.

58:36.412 --> 58:38.813
You all right?
Yes, sir.

58:46.555 --> 58:48.823
You good?
Yeah.

58:54.463 --> 58:57.800
How much further?
A couple of hours.

58:57.801 --> 59:00.835
Hey, what was in that syringe?

59:02.471 --> 59:05.606
A little of everything, I expect.

59:34.803 --> 59:38.239
Collins, confirm the head count.

59:38.941 --> 59:40.709
I still show five.

59:40.710 --> 59:44.178
Okay, we lost one of our boys.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.182
But I don't think,
for the record...

59:47.183 --> 59:51.153
we can positively I.D. the individuals
on the ground as our own.

59:51.154 --> 59:54.757
But, sir, I think it's clear...
Since we cannot make a positive ID...

59:54.758 --> 59:57.826
this remains an official
search-and-rescue operation...

59:57.827 --> 59:59.928
and we can therefore
keep our bird on scene.

59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.830
So in case those happen
to be our boys...

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:04.166
we should let them know
we have eyes on them.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:07.669
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please stand by for orders.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:11.639
<i>Gray Base
One, California standing by.</i>

01:00:17.479 --> 01:00:18.947
Again?
Seriously?

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.749
These guys don't fight
from 200 feet.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:27.189
If they're down this low, it's to say,
"Hey, we know you're up and running."

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.859
Mind if I do the honors?
Be my guest.

01:00:35.297 --> 01:00:39.535
I believe we have confirmation our
team understands eyes are back on.

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:41.236
You think, Parker?

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:45.774
All right. Let's get California back up
top. Eyes only until they need us.

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:50.145
- <i>California, pull back.
- Gray Base One, California will comply.</i>

01:00:57.953 --> 01:00:59.154
We're almost there.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:03.290
The mines are just on the
other side of this pass.

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:11.098
We're clear.

01:01:13.068 --> 01:01:15.936
Okay, close the gate.

01:01:22.277 --> 01:01:24.012
Let's go.

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.780
Victor.

01:01:26.248 --> 01:01:28.616
See the mine shaft?

01:01:28.617 --> 01:01:32.154
Two guard detachments, both sheltered.
Guards are staying put.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:36.992
So any satellite images will
show this place is still inactive.

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:42.432
Which means Malin's hideout
will be underground.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.800
A foxhole.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:48.003
Definitely. The few things
we've learned about Malin...

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:51.039
have always been
the opposite of what we assumed.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.744
Collins, let's get up close and
personal in case they need the support.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.078
Yes, sir.

01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:59.046
California, this is Gray Base One.

01:01:59.047 --> 01:02:02.517
Please adjust to an 8K ceiling for
max visual and pending support.

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:05.254
Gray Base One,
California will comply.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:08.089
Repeat. Will comply.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.829
So what's the plan?

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.865
Kamikaze with a twist?

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.066
I got you.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.007
Kamikaze...

01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:30.144
with a twist?

01:02:30.212 --> 01:02:33.714
You're gonna love this one.

01:02:39.788 --> 01:02:42.223
Hey, who's that?
Watch out.

01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:47.194
Nobody's in the truck.

01:02:59.074 --> 01:03:01.175
Go, go, go.

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:15.122
- Another fuckin' .50-cal.
- Grenade!

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:20.795
Don't stop.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:03:23.231 --> 01:03:26.368
- Bubba!
- Grenade!

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.969
Let's go! Move up!

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.143
Case. What you got?

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:37.211
Map.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.286
You guys take the main entrance.

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:47.923
I'll take the elevator.
We'll meet in the middle.

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.993
Fuckin' maverick.
I got you.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.894
All right. On me.

01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:23.290
We ain't here to hurt you.

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:27.394
- They're just miners.
- All right. Stack up.

01:04:33.235 --> 01:04:35.137
Boys ready
to go down the rabbit hole?

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.872
That's why we came, right?

01:04:39.908 --> 01:04:42.411
Goddamn it.

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:46.447
On your 6:00, Case.
On your 6:00.

01:04:46.715 --> 01:04:48.750
This has to be the spot.
Yeah.

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:53.320
These guys seem pretty motivated.
Guarding the king's quarters.

01:04:59.494 --> 01:05:04.632
Jay, me and you take the right flank.
The rest of you...

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.803
Bubba, on me.

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:19.647
Bubba, go.
Sir.

01:05:26.054 --> 01:05:28.088
Get down!

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.826
- Goddamn it.
- B!

01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:33.228
Bubba, you all right?
I'll check if it's over here.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.864
Zoe, wait. Stay together.

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:36.898
Goddamn it.

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:38.266
Hey, B. Bubs.

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:41.902
Vic, we're on your 6:00.

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:44.172
- What happened?
- A knife.

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:48.410
- You okay? Where's Zoe?
- Went that way.

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:50.946
We'll take that section, find her.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.348
Look after Bubs.
Go. I've got him.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.382
Hey.

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:58.185
Hey, B.
Bubs, hang in there, kid.

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:11.066
Malin better be still alive.
Motherfucker!

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:16.004
Who betrayed me?
Who, mother cocksucker?

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:29.516
You've gotta be shitting me.
Tail pipe, now.

01:06:43.064 --> 01:06:44.533
Shit!

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:47.402
- You got a missile lock.
- I know.

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:51.372
- All right. Evasive action.
- Countermeasure engaged.

01:07:03.418 --> 01:07:04.853
California, Gray Base One.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:08.555
We seem to have lost our feed.
Please advise.

01:07:11.393 --> 01:07:14.329
You two, go to the safe house.
Set up a meeting.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:17.564
What the hell's going on?

01:07:18.433 --> 01:07:21.036
Get Commander Ricks
on the line right now.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.337
Yes, ma'am.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:25.305
You two, come with me.

01:07:25.874 --> 01:07:28.577
Y'all think that Zoe
chick's gonna be all right?

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.612
Haven't you been paying attention?

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:34.214
This lady knows exactly
what she's doing.

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:37.518
Left.

01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:39.487
Got an office down here?

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.089
I'm gonna do a sweep.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:44.058
Be back in two minutes.
All right.

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.542
Sweep done, man.
All clear.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:04.246
No sign of Zoe. No sign of guards.
No sign of nothing.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:07.315
- I just e-mailed CENTCOM.
- E-mail?

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.284
Yeah, no landline.

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.419
Malin's network.
The best I could do.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.089
Commander, you need to see this.
You're not gonna believe it...

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.024
but a message from the team was just
routed to us from Little Creek.

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.361
What?
They sent an e-mail to their home base...

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:21.296
requesting immediate medevac.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:22.697
An e-mail? That's brilliant.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.533
Collins, we need the helicopter.
I need field medics on standby.

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:29.571
We got a SEAL down. I repeat.
We got a SEAL down.

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:33.107
Make it happen, goddamn it.
Figure it out.

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:36.344
Where is this Malin anyway,
the yellowcake?

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:38.179
I don't know.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.117
Soldiers for hire don't fight like
that to protect an empty nest.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.019
Malin's here.
I'm sure of it.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.854
We're missing something.
Yeah, like?

01:08:50.058 --> 01:08:51.993
So Malin pays Tonga
to secure the area...

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:55.229
<i>so he can quietly stockpile</i>
<i>yellowcake for a huge sale.</i>

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:58.166
But there's a problem when you
pay an army for protection.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.903
Yeah, like who's gonna
protect you from the army?

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.136
Exactly.

01:09:02.136 --> 01:09:04.805
<i>So Tonga realizes that the
shit he's paid to protect...</i>

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.042
<i>is worth more than he's
being paid to protect it.</i>

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.477
<i>He becomes a threat. Malin has
no way of taking him out.</i>

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:12.513
<i>It turns out he don't need to.
We do it for him.</i>

01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:18.185
Who pushed over the first domino?

01:09:18.185 --> 01:09:22.189
We took out Tonga's camp based
on intel from the local asset...

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.259
Zoe Jelani.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.294
<i>She got caught on purpose.</i>

01:09:28.563 --> 01:09:29.997
No, she didn't.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.600
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.502
She's a proven
local asset doing what?

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:38.572
<i>Ratting out her competition.</i>

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.475
<i>So she's got a perfect record...</i>

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.845
because all she has to do is point
to Tonga's training camp...

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:45.912
and scream "Al-Qaeda"
and we just vaporize it.

01:09:45.913 --> 01:09:48.783
Yep. And physical
confirmation is needed now.

01:09:48.783 --> 01:09:51.987
And she gets caught somehow...

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.587
by Tonga...

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.156
the one person that can ID her.

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:59.361
He was about to
tell us exactly who she was.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.495
So she offs him.

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:04.499
And we buy it. Why wouldn't we?
I'm sure he did torture her.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.768
Then she tells us
about the yellowcake...

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:09.204
convinces us to walk her
through the gauntlet...

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:12.239
so she doesn't miss her sale.

01:10:12.674 --> 01:10:14.642
We still alive, right?

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:17.644
You do know how to pick 'em, Case.

01:10:17.645 --> 01:10:20.914
Let's go get her.
Damn straight.

01:10:47.375 --> 01:10:49.110
Run, run.

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:51.912
Why can't you
like nice women, Case?

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.458
Vic, Bubba!

01:11:13.401 --> 01:11:15.570
Vic, Bubba!
Get outta here! Now!

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:18.972
What the fuck's going on?
What's all the noise?

01:11:23.111 --> 01:11:26.546
No, no, no.
Bubba, Vic.

01:11:27.715 --> 01:11:29.451
- Case.
- We gotta get them out.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.620
Case, we gotta go.
Case, we gotta go, man.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:36.124
Case, we gotta go.
We gotta go!

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.292
Move it.
Right.

01:11:41.696 --> 01:11:44.031
We should go now.

01:12:03.184 --> 01:12:05.485
Let's go.

01:12:14.896 --> 01:12:17.898
Fuck! Turn around.

01:12:22.537 --> 01:12:24.671
Fuck.
Shit.

01:12:25.773 --> 01:12:28.375
Come on, faster.
Kill them.

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:35.916
Jay!

01:12:46.227 --> 01:12:49.297
Fuck, he's still alive.
Grab him. We will use him.

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:53.533
- What about the other one?
- He's as good as dead.

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:05.545
Jay!

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:36.444
Just you?
Get us out of here, fast.

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:40.046
You got comms with Ricks?
Delta channel.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:47.989
Ricks, Case on Delta channel.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.959
- <i>Come in. Do you read?</i>
<i>- Go for Ricks.</i>

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.360
<i>Vic and Bubba didn't make it.</i>

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:56.464
So you have three SEALs down
there that need to come home.

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:57.932
<i>And Ricks...</i>

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:58.933
they got Jay.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:01.669
- <i>What do you mean, they got Jay?
- Malin has him.</i>

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:05.573
- How the fuck did that happen?
- The fuckin' asset is Malin.

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:08.243
What the fuck you
want from me anyway?

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:09.677
You fuckin' missing Case?

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:13.146
I'll ask the questions.
Fuckin' bitch.

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:22.357
What the fuck do you
think I know that can help you?

01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:23.957
Nothing.

01:14:26.327 --> 01:14:29.897
<i>Kinshasa is ground zero
for Malin's smuggling pipeline.</i>

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.933
<i>She probably has</i>
<i>a distribution point...</i>

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:34.669
where she can ship out
small, untraceable loads.

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:39.340
<i>And now we know every bit of
intel the C.I.A. has on Malin...</i>

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.541
was planted by Malin.

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:45.046
Okay, Case,
we got three dead SEALs.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:48.082
And now they got
a live SEAL as a bonus.

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:53.220
Why the fuck are you torturing me?

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:56.590
Come on.
I'm not torturing you.

01:14:58.626 --> 01:14:59.994
I'm giving you a taste...

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:03.964
of what your new life
will be like in Iran.

01:15:03.965 --> 01:15:07.068
<i>We know she
operates from the slums.</i>

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:11.339
I'm guessing the intel she was
pushing never pointed there.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.439
He's right.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.775
<i>Can you think of a better
place to set up shop?</i>

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:19.581
The cops won't go near it. It's like
another planet in there with mob rule.

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:22.650
Fuckin' bitch.

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:25.586
You might want to show
a little respect.

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.663
<i>She's protected in there.</i>

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:38.466
All these warlords
treat their territory the same.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:42.937
<i>Like a tribal kingdom.</i>
<i>We saw it in Mog back in '06.</i>

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:46.407
Find me the tallest
building in the slums...

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.343
or directly adjacent.

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:50.812
She may or may not be there,

01:15:50.813 --> 01:15:53.548
but even money says
she controls it.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.351
Let's do it. Do it.

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:59.420
We got an apartment complex.
Nsele Tower.

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:01.055
It's the tallest
structure in the area.

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.223
<i>It's right on the perimeter.
What do you think?</i>

01:16:03.224 --> 01:16:06.227
<i>It's a place to start, and I'm
scrambling a team to recon with you.</i>

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:09.196
How long?
<i>Two and a half hours, on the inside.</i>

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:11.466
That's too long. The window
might be closed by then.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:12.800
I'm gonna drop in solo.

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:15.837
I don't want you dropping in with
nothing but your dick in your hand.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:19.774
- I appreciate it.
- Here. Take my cell phone.

01:16:23.277 --> 01:16:25.079
<i>Now I'm just gonna do lead recon.</i>

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.748
<i>I won't shake the tree until
the cavalry gets there.</i>

01:16:30.117 --> 01:16:32.019
<i>No. Chase, I don't like it.</i>

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.254
Come on, Ricks.
We're probably wrong anyway.

01:16:34.255 --> 01:16:38.259
<i>At least I can start eliminating
possible locations, narrow the options.</i>

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.096
Hello? Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:46.301
Okay, Case, listen to me. Keep your
head down and your mouth shut.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.836
I'm done losing men today.

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:51.237
Me too.

01:16:53.174 --> 01:16:56.743
Fuck me.

01:17:12.093 --> 01:17:14.128
Ricks, got a visual on the van.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:18.765
- Case, talk to me.
- <i>Hold on, I'll take a closer look.</i>

01:17:44.792 --> 01:17:46.994
Empty.

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:50.031
Wait. I hear something.
I'll get back to you.

01:18:21.262 --> 01:18:23.030
I got Case again for you.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.732
<i>Hey, Ricks.</i>

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:28.134
I think I got something for you.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.285
Trace that voice.

01:18:56.931 --> 01:18:58.965
Get that?

01:19:00.101 --> 01:19:00.735
Got it.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.038
We've confirmed the buyer is an
Iranian operative named Amjad...

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:07.341
<i>with ties to the terrorist
cell Al-Shabaab.</i>

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:09.944
Amjad will probably take the
final shipment of the uranium...

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:13.247
but we suspect the final payment
will be at Malin's safe house...

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.850
where she is most likely
holding Jay.

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:19.020
- Location?
- Near the old market.

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:22.422
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasn't broken up the payload...

01:19:22.523 --> 01:19:25.193
<i>there should be enough to nail
down the uranium signature.</i>

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:27.028
Case, just observe.

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:28.930
Bravo is close.
They're 20 klicks out.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:33.868
I gotta keep moving. He'll lead me
to Malin. I'm not losing Jay.

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.004
Case?

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:40.574
He's gonna do it.
He's gotta.

01:21:07.695 --> 01:21:10.698
Over there.
There he is.

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:16.035
- This way, everybody.
- Go, go, go.

01:21:53.874 --> 01:21:57.143
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, you assholes!

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.751
Grenade!

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:24.057
Get back! Get back!

01:24:34.435 --> 01:24:37.336
Oh, you wanna play kamikaze?

01:24:37.538 --> 01:24:40.273
Let's play kamikaze.

01:25:16.143 --> 01:25:19.345
Get back! Get back!

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:16.402
Grenade.

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:45.765
Shit.

01:27:24.705 --> 01:27:27.240
Guess who.

01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:30.309
Fire!

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:58.938
Thanks, Jay.

01:28:27.334 --> 01:28:30.603
- Hello.
- You're late.

01:29:28.263 --> 01:29:31.030
Navy SEAL, motherfucker.

01:29:41.408 --> 01:29:45.445
There are two more detachments
coming to get me out of here.

01:29:45.746 --> 01:29:48.949
You and your friend are
standing in your own grave.

01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:54.721
How many villages are dying of radiation
poisoning from work in your mine?

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:57.590
What do you think that's like?

01:29:58.192 --> 01:30:00.426
I can't even imagine.

01:30:08.335 --> 01:30:10.703
You won't have to.

01:30:12.472 --> 01:30:14.473
Do it.

01:30:14.908 --> 01:30:15.876
Do it.

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.277
Come on. Do it.

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:21.982
You Americans are so weak.

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:26.519
Without your drones and
missiles, you'd be nothing.

01:30:26.753 --> 01:30:31.757
Even if you kill me,
another will take my place...

01:30:31.758 --> 01:30:34.995
probably hired with the same money.

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:37.630
Helping people like Tonga...

01:30:39.533 --> 01:30:42.701
sacrificing innocent people...

01:30:42.869 --> 01:30:46.071
sacrificing my friends.

01:30:47.574 --> 01:30:49.975
It has to stop.

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:54.647
Well, stop this.

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:08.661
Oh, God.
You motherfucker!

01:31:10.397 --> 01:31:12.866
No, don't go away!

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:15.902
Help me! Help me!

01:31:36.523 --> 01:31:38.659
That is a whole lot of nuke juice.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.994
Enough to get you
in the superpower club.

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:47.901
Comfortable, Commander?

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:51.772
You realize that everybody around you
is wearing a hazmat suit, right?

01:31:51.773 --> 01:31:53.307
We're immune to nukes.

01:31:53.308 --> 01:31:56.376
<i>So how about a
ride out of this shit hole?</i>

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:57.344
Half a klick away.

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:59.813
I want you two to take
some "R" and "R," gentlemen.

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:03.182
And I want you to make it count.

01:32:04.384 --> 01:32:07.653
Thanks, Chief.
Chief.

01:32:10.857 --> 01:32:13.192
Where should we go?

01:32:16.363 --> 01:32:19.866
Jay, shift your weight.
Shut up, old man.

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:23.937
This ain't "E" and "E,"
it's "R" and "R" for me.

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:26.005
You know...

01:32:26.907 --> 01:32:30.009
I haven't thanked you yet.
For what?

01:32:30.677 --> 01:32:33.647
Your excellent work in
picking a vacation spot.

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:37.783
Come on, man. You know I was
born to roll like this.

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:41.220
Yes, I do.

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:59.439
Check this kid out.
Yep, the C.I.A. is gonna be pissed.
