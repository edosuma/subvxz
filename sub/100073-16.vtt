WEBVTT

00:01.141 --> 00:04.061
I just wanted to give
the judges some happy juice

00:04.061 --> 00:05.311
before we got started.

00:05.311 --> 00:07.191
The world needs
more love, man.

00:07.191 --> 00:10.351
I agree, but meth smoothies
are a felony.

00:10.351 --> 00:12.191
My backpack.
I left it in the green room.

00:12.191 --> 00:13.401
It has my ID in it.

00:13.401 --> 00:14.811
Go get it, Boot.
Meet me down at the shop.

00:14.811 --> 00:15.851
It's the fluffy one.

00:15.851 --> 00:17.061
I'm sorry.

00:17.061 --> 00:19.021
Oh.
Sorry.

00:20.811 --> 00:22.101
Uh, so sorry.

00:25.731 --> 00:28.601
There you are.
Come on.
Oh, no, I --

00:28.601 --> 00:30.141
You're up next.
I'm actually not --

00:30.141 --> 00:31.851
First you'll speak to Ryan, then
you go in front of the judges.

00:31.851 --> 00:33.441
You'll only have 15 minutes,
so make them count.

00:33.441 --> 00:34.521
They're --
That's act--
Let's go!

00:35.731 --> 00:36.941
Hello. Hi.

00:36.941 --> 00:38.441
Oh!
Hi.

00:38.441 --> 00:40.441
You're --
I like it.
The cop uniform.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.901
That is fun.
Um...

00:41.901 --> 00:43.691
What's your name?
Um, uh, I'm -- I'm Lucy Chen,

00:43.691 --> 00:44.981
but that -- there's
actually been a mistake.
Hi, Lucy.

00:44.981 --> 00:46.601
I'm not supposed to --
No, look, I understand.

00:46.601 --> 00:48.021
You're nervous.
Everybody is.
No.

00:48.021 --> 00:49.481
Just before you get in there,
take a deep breath.
It's time.

00:49.481 --> 00:51.191
No, I'm not --
And do your thing.

00:51.191 --> 00:53.771
What?
Sing your heart out,
okay, Lucy?

00:53.771 --> 00:56.061
Uh...

00:56.061 --> 00:57.191
How are you?
How are you?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.851
-Uh...
-Hold on. Are we okay?

00:58.851 --> 01:01.481
-Yeah. Hi.
-Hi.

01:01.481 --> 01:03.021
Uh, right in the center
there.
Are we in trouble?

01:03.021 --> 01:05.311
No, no. Of course not.
I...

01:05.311 --> 01:09.481
I-I got pushed in here,
and, uh, it's it's...

01:11.231 --> 01:12.851
Are you a co--
a contestant?

01:12.851 --> 01:16.691
Um, you know, I...

01:16.691 --> 01:18.271
I seem to be
wearing a sticker right now.

01:18.271 --> 01:19.521
Okay, who are you?

01:19.521 --> 01:21.401
Hi, I-I'm Lucy Chen.

01:21.401 --> 01:22.901
I'm from Los Angeles.

01:22.901 --> 01:24.271
Are you
in the right place?

01:24.271 --> 01:26.351
There was a very, uh,
sweet woman that

01:26.351 --> 01:29.691
put a sticker on me,
and Seacrest kind of

01:29.691 --> 01:31.101
-Well, welcome to the show.
-Thank you.

01:31.101 --> 01:32.691
-I mean, yeah.
-Okay.

01:32.691 --> 01:36.771
Um, Officer, what are you
going to sing for us today?

01:36.771 --> 01:38.401
Oh. Uh...

01:38.401 --> 01:40.021
You're on the tee.
You got the number.

01:40.021 --> 01:41.401
-You got the number.
-Yeah.

01:41.401 --> 01:45.271
I'll sing, um, "I-I Never Loved
a Man" by Aretha.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.231
It's one of
my favorites.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.811

Uh, I'm so--
What?

02:52.561 --> 02:53.601
I have to go.
Lionel and Katy:
Wait, no, no, no, no,

02:53.601 --> 02:54.601
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

02:54.601 --> 02:55.561
-Wait, wait!
-No!

02:55.561 --> 02:57.401
-Coming!
-Wait, wait.

02:57.401 --> 02:58.601
What are you doing

03:12.271 --> 03:13.441
Ever given blood before?

03:13.441 --> 03:14.641
Every eight weeks,
like clockwork.

03:14.641 --> 03:16.061
Good for you.

03:16.061 --> 03:17.941
Yeah, save lives,
get a personal oil change.

03:17.941 --> 03:19.231
It's win-win.

03:19.231 --> 03:20.981
I didn't know
machines had blood.

03:22.521 --> 03:25.061
You know the drill.
Light squeezes.

03:25.061 --> 03:27.481
How's it going,
Mr. AB Negative?
Good.

03:27.481 --> 03:29.941
Donating blood is bringing back
some complicated memories

03:29.941 --> 03:31.271
of when Henry was born.

03:31.271 --> 03:32.691
He had TOF.

03:32.691 --> 03:34.561
I spent a lot of time
in the hospital banking blood.

03:34.561 --> 03:35.481
I had no idea.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.191
What's TOF?
Tetralogy of Fallot.

03:37.191 --> 03:38.061
It's a heart defect.

03:38.061 --> 03:39.401
Four defects, actually.

03:39.401 --> 03:40.811
It's corrected
by surgery.

03:40.811 --> 03:43.601
Three of them he had
before he was a year old.

03:43.601 --> 03:45.351
Since we share the same
rare blood type,

03:45.351 --> 03:48.271
I donated approximately
16 gallons.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.601
But everything's okay
right now, right?

03:49.601 --> 03:51.771
Oh, yeah. All his checkups
have been fantastic.

03:51.771 --> 03:53.441
Thank God.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.981
So,
when are we going out again?

03:54.981 --> 03:57.021
How about this weekend?
I can't.

03:57.021 --> 03:58.811
Um, Oliver's coming, and I'm
gonna take him to Disneyland.

03:58.811 --> 04:00.601
Oh, I could tag along.

04:00.601 --> 04:02.311
Um...
Or not.

04:02.311 --> 04:05.481
It's just -- I only have him
every other weekend, so I...

04:05.481 --> 04:07.271
No need to explain.
How about dinner tonight?

04:07.271 --> 04:08.901
Great.
Yeah, that sounds good.

04:10.191 --> 04:11.941
Make sure you drink
the whole thing down.

04:11.941 --> 04:15.351
Woman, I'm a grown-ass man.
I don't need a juice box.

04:15.351 --> 04:17.101
Whoa.

04:17.101 --> 04:18.060
You okay?

04:18.060 --> 04:19.481
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

04:19.481 --> 04:21.690
Sir, did you just faint?

04:21.690 --> 04:23.641
No, I briefly
succumbed to gravity.

04:40.231 --> 04:42.271
Sorry.
I was trying to be quiet.

04:42.271 --> 04:44.521
It's not you. It's the wind
that keeps waking me up.

04:44.521 --> 04:46.521
Yeah, it's supposed to
get worse by tonight.

04:46.521 --> 04:48.311
These graveyard shifts
are brutal.

04:48.311 --> 04:50.441
But tonight
is the last one.

04:50.441 --> 04:52.231
And then five days
in Napa.

04:52.231 --> 04:53.771
I have
every detail planned.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.521
Horseback riding, couples
massages, hot-air-balloon ride.

04:56.521 --> 04:58.021
You're forgetting
a very important word here.

04:58.021 --> 04:59.351
Wine.

04:59.351 --> 05:01.401
Oh, I got reservations
at six tasting rooms.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.771
Good.
Mm-hmm.

05:02.771 --> 05:04.191
Mm.

05:06.101 --> 05:08.021
Now go away so I can sleep.

05:08.021 --> 05:09.691
Yes, ma'am.

05:09.691 --> 05:10.771
I love ya.

05:10.771 --> 05:11.771
I love you, too.

05:16.061 --> 05:17.481
Don't act so happy
to see me.

05:17.481 --> 05:19.191
If you're here in person,
it means something is wrong.

05:20.691 --> 05:21.851
It's Lila.

05:21.851 --> 05:23.021
What's Lila?

05:23.021 --> 05:24.641
Wait.

05:24.641 --> 05:26.351
Don't freak out.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.101
She's having nightmares
again.

05:31.101 --> 05:32.561
Three nights this week,

05:32.561 --> 05:34.641
she woke me up
saying she heard screaming.

05:34.641 --> 05:37.441
Then last night, she said she
saw a ghost outside her window.

05:37.441 --> 05:39.401
A ghost?
I could
barely console her.

05:39.401 --> 05:41.811
She wanted you.
She said only Mommy can help.

05:41.811 --> 05:43.561
Did you look
outside her window?

05:43.561 --> 05:45.271
For a ghost? No.

05:45.271 --> 05:46.141
She was
having a nightmare.

05:46.141 --> 05:48.351
It has nothing to do
with ghosts.

05:48.351 --> 05:49.601
You think it's about
what happened?

05:49.601 --> 05:50.691
Of course.

05:52.311 --> 05:55.521
Okay, um, thank you
for telling me.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.271
I can come by the house
in a little bit

05:58.271 --> 05:59.731
and talk to her myself.

05:59.731 --> 06:00.941
Can you do that
while you're on duty?

06:00.941 --> 06:03.311
Yeah,
when it's important.

06:03.311 --> 06:04.981
Good.
Good.

06:04.981 --> 06:06.811
I need to get
a restraining order.

06:06.811 --> 06:08.561
Okay.
Uh, against whom?

06:08.561 --> 06:10.231
My cat.

06:10.231 --> 06:11.731
Meow Tse Tung.

06:11.731 --> 06:14.901
I'm sorry, sir. We only handle
complaints here against people.

06:14.901 --> 06:15.981
Don't you want to know
what he did?

06:15.981 --> 06:18.141
I really don't.

06:18.141 --> 06:19.901
I hope you have
a nice day.

06:23.901 --> 06:26.401
Hi.
I'm Valerie Castillo.

06:26.401 --> 06:28.061
I work for
the Los Angeles Herald.

06:28.061 --> 06:29.691
I'm here to see
yesterday's case reports.

06:29.691 --> 06:31.641
Okay.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.731
You a crime reporter?

06:32.731 --> 06:34.601
Um, not yet.

06:34.601 --> 06:37.351
I write for the Style Section,
going on 15 years.

06:37.351 --> 06:39.601
Oh.
But I'm over it.

06:39.601 --> 06:41.811
It's all been reduced to
sex tips and celebrity gossip.

06:41.811 --> 06:43.141
You know, the clickbait.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.191
Mm, so you're fishing
for a real story?

06:45.191 --> 06:47.101
Actually,
I've already got one.

06:47.101 --> 06:48.441
Do you know
anything about

06:48.441 --> 06:50.271
a bunch of robberies
at five-star hotels?

06:50.271 --> 06:51.601
Mm, first I've heard
of it.

06:51.601 --> 06:53.521
Well, a concierge
at the Borden

06:53.521 --> 06:55.401
told me that two guests
were beaten and robbed there

06:55.401 --> 06:56.811
in the last few weeks.

06:56.811 --> 06:59.561
Now, neither victim
want her to contact the police.

06:59.561 --> 07:01.271
When I went to
other stations

07:01.271 --> 07:02.851
to look through
the crime reports,

07:02.851 --> 07:06.311
I found three similar incidents
in hotels around town.

07:06.311 --> 07:08.101
Is there a description
of the attacker?

07:08.101 --> 07:10.231
No, because
none of the men gave one.

07:10.231 --> 07:11.901
But the cases
have to be connected.

07:11.901 --> 07:14.101
Yeah, I mean,
it sure seems like it.
Right?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.851
You know, you don't want
the case reports.

07:16.851 --> 07:18.521
There's actually
a lot more information

07:18.521 --> 07:19.811
in the CAD printouts.

07:19.811 --> 07:21.061
What are those?

07:21.061 --> 07:22.691
Computer Aided Dispatch
reports.

07:22.691 --> 07:24.771
Why are you volunteering
to show her those?

07:24.771 --> 07:26.061
This is a reporter
from the Herald,

07:26.061 --> 07:27.851
and these are
public-facing documents.

07:27.851 --> 07:29.441
Valerie Castillo.

07:29.441 --> 07:32.311
They're only public-facing
when asked for.

07:32.311 --> 07:36.021
Can I see the CAD reports,
please?

07:36.021 --> 07:37.901
Fine.
Give 'em to her.

07:37.901 --> 07:40.271
Thank you.
Not a fan of the press?

07:40.271 --> 07:42.231
Eh, Herald's got
a bias against the police.

07:42.231 --> 07:43.521
No, we don't.
It's implicit.

07:43.521 --> 07:45.691
Unlike your bias
against me.
Cute.

07:47.191 --> 07:49.441
You know, the media
will say or do anything

07:49.441 --> 07:50.561
to get you
to back up their headline.

07:50.561 --> 07:52.691
And make sure she gives you
those printouts back.

07:52.691 --> 07:54.141
And get ready to roll.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.271
We're gonna hit the streets
as soon as I change.

07:55.271 --> 07:56.521
Yes, sir.

07:56.521 --> 07:58.401
You shouldn't let him
talk to you like that.

07:58.401 --> 08:01.641
He's my training officer.
That's just kind of his style.

08:01.641 --> 08:03.271
Well, being an ass
isn't style.

08:04.191 --> 08:05.441
But he sure can
wear a suit.

08:10.021 --> 08:11.981
I thought that only happened
in Road Runner cartoons.

08:11.981 --> 08:13.601
It's the Santa Ana winds.

08:13.601 --> 08:15.601
You're officially
an LA resident now.

08:15.601 --> 08:17.271
Nyla!

08:17.271 --> 08:19.061
Is that you?

08:20.641 --> 08:21.851
It's been too long!

08:21.851 --> 08:23.481
Yeah, no, yeah.
It sure has.

08:23.481 --> 08:25.901
Sorry about
you and Donovan.

08:25.901 --> 08:28.141
You were always
such a lovely family.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.351
Benjamin and I are in a bit of
a rough patch right now, too.

08:31.351 --> 08:33.231
Why are relationships so hard?

08:33.231 --> 08:34.770
Because most people suck.

08:35.811 --> 08:37.101
Well, I-I'll let you go.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.811
I hope to see you around
more often.

08:38.811 --> 08:41.061
Oh, yeah.
You, too.

08:41.061 --> 08:43.270
Who was that?
No clue.

08:43.270 --> 08:44.481
Don and I bought this house

08:44.481 --> 08:46.851
while I was neck-deep
in undercover work.

08:46.851 --> 08:49.641
I could barely focus on my
family, let alone the neighbors.

08:54.731 --> 08:55.811
Everything okay?

08:55.811 --> 08:58.101
Uh, yeah.

08:58.101 --> 09:01.101
No, I just -- I haven't been
inside since we separated.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.231
Hey.
Hi.

09:13.521 --> 09:15.401
Donovan,
nice to see you again.

09:15.401 --> 09:17.101
Yeah. You, too.

09:17.101 --> 09:19.941
Come on in.
Thank you.

09:19.941 --> 09:22.271
Wow.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.061
You redecorated.

09:24.061 --> 09:26.731
Yeah. Place needed
some new energy.

09:26.731 --> 09:30.311
So, uh, did you hire
a decorator, or...

09:30.311 --> 09:32.141
No. Did it all myself.

09:32.141 --> 09:33.311
Oh.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.771
What?

09:34.771 --> 09:36.191
Nothing. No.
You said, "Oh."

09:36.191 --> 09:39.641
I -- It -- You just never
really had -- had style before.

09:41.521 --> 09:42.901
Mommy!

09:42.901 --> 09:44.561
Hi, baby.

09:44.561 --> 09:45.901
Mm.

09:45.901 --> 09:46.851
Let's go talk in your room,
'kay?

09:46.851 --> 09:48.731
Okay.

09:48.731 --> 09:50.191
Something to drink?

09:50.191 --> 09:51.731
Oh, no, I'm good,
thanks.

09:51.731 --> 09:54.141
Sorry to hear that you've been
having some rough nights.

09:54.141 --> 09:56.021
Yeah,
it's not the first time.

09:56.021 --> 09:58.521
She's been having nightmares
on and off for over a year,

09:58.521 --> 10:00.481
ever since...

10:00.481 --> 10:02.561
it happened.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.941
Ever since what happened?

10:04.941 --> 10:07.141
So Daddy tells me

10:07.141 --> 10:08.691
that you are not
sleeping so good.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.401
Mnh-mnh.
I keep getting woken up.

10:11.401 --> 10:13.691
By the nightmares?
They're not nightmares.

10:13.691 --> 10:15.401
I hear
somebody screaming.

10:15.401 --> 10:16.981
Honey, it's probably
just the wind.

10:16.981 --> 10:19.101
I mean, the Santa Anas
are really blowing.

10:19.101 --> 10:21.441
No, but it started
before them.

10:21.441 --> 10:23.731
Okay.

10:23.731 --> 10:26.351
And then last night, did you
tell Daddy you saw a ghost?

10:26.351 --> 10:28.481
I said it looked
like a ghost.

10:28.481 --> 10:31.441
Ghosts aren't real.

10:31.441 --> 10:33.141
Okay, so,
what did you see, then?

10:33.141 --> 10:35.691
Well, I saw a woman...

10:35.691 --> 10:37.021
walking down the street.

10:37.021 --> 10:39.231
In a nightgown.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.021
She had blood
on her hands.

10:45.851 --> 10:47.601
It was right before
we split.

10:47.601 --> 10:49.901
Nyla had been
working undercover

10:49.901 --> 10:51.771
for almost a year,

10:51.771 --> 10:53.271
had barely come home.

10:53.271 --> 10:54.811
We were in a bad place,

10:54.811 --> 10:56.441
but we were trying to
make it work.

10:56.441 --> 10:59.561
And then she took Lila
to the supermarket.

11:01.901 --> 11:03.311
You know why we moved
out here?

11:03.311 --> 11:04.771
'Cause it's
a nice neighborhood?

11:04.771 --> 11:07.351
'Cause it was
nowhere near where Nyla worked.

11:07.351 --> 11:09.191
She couldn't run the risk of
running into a criminal

11:09.191 --> 11:10.811
who knew her
as someone else on the street.

11:10.811 --> 11:12.481
And that's what happened
at the store.

11:12.481 --> 11:14.021
A drug dealer
she'd put away.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.811
He recognized her.

11:16.811 --> 11:21.941
And tried to kill her
in front of my daughter.

11:21.941 --> 11:23.191
Do you believe me?

11:23.191 --> 11:24.731
Honey, I-I --

11:24.731 --> 11:26.441
No lies. You promised.

11:28.561 --> 11:29.941
Yes.

11:29.941 --> 11:32.401
I believe you.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.561
And I'm glad
you wanted to tell me.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.191
You're a police officer,
and someone needs help.

11:39.601 --> 11:40.811
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

11:40.811 --> 11:42.231
No, no, it's, um...

11:43.101 --> 11:45.231
What?
What's going on?

11:45.231 --> 11:47.481
Just waiting on you.
How'd it go?

11:47.481 --> 11:51.731
Uh, Lila says it wasn't a ghost
and it wasn't a nightmare.

11:51.731 --> 11:53.271
And I believe her.

11:53.271 --> 11:54.311
Then what was it?
I don't know.

11:54.311 --> 11:58.351
But, um, I would like
to stay here tonight,

11:58.351 --> 12:01.231
maybe do some surveillance,
if that's okay.

12:01.231 --> 12:02.941
You really think
that's necessary?

12:02.941 --> 12:05.691
Well, Lila needs to see that
we're taking her seriously.

12:05.691 --> 12:06.851
Oh, and I don't?

12:06.851 --> 12:09.351
I-I am sure
that's not what she meant.

12:09.351 --> 12:12.141
It's not.
I ju--

12:12.141 --> 12:13.641
I just want to be here
for her.

12:15.351 --> 12:17.941
Okay. Sure.

12:17.941 --> 12:18.941
Come back tonight.

12:18.941 --> 12:20.771
Okay.

12:20.771 --> 12:22.811
Don told you
about what happened.

12:22.811 --> 12:24.561
It sounded awful.

12:24.561 --> 12:28.141
Yeah, it was, and he used it
against me in court.

12:28.141 --> 12:29.901
He convinced the judge

12:29.901 --> 12:32.941
that Lila wasn't safe
around me unsupervised.

12:32.941 --> 12:34.601
That was also awful.

12:42.601 --> 12:44.191
What is it?

12:44.191 --> 12:46.561
Uh, Lila's room
is right there.

12:46.561 --> 12:49.141
She said the woman
with the blood on her hands

12:49.141 --> 12:52.691
was right about here.

12:52.691 --> 12:54.141
Does that look like blood
to you?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.481
Could be.

12:55.481 --> 12:58.271
Or oil
or transmission fluid.

12:58.271 --> 12:59.641
Want me to call in
a forensics team?

12:59.641 --> 13:02.641
For a ghost hunt? No,
they'd laugh me off the radio.

13:02.641 --> 13:04.231
I could call it in.

13:04.231 --> 13:05.401
Rookies get laughed at
all the time.

13:05.401 --> 13:07.021
I appreciate that,
but odds are it's nothing.

13:08.811 --> 13:10.851
Alright, uh,
back to work.

13:12.441 --> 13:14.601
I'm telling you.
Reporters always have an agenda.

13:14.601 --> 13:16.691
To get the truth?
Sounds horrible.

13:16.691 --> 13:18.101
Don't be so naive.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.271
Well
I am not naive.

13:19.271 --> 13:21.141
I'm just not like you.

13:21.141 --> 13:22.141
God,
you don't trust anyone.

13:22.141 --> 13:23.981
'Cause trust
has to be earned.

13:23.981 --> 13:25.811
All I'm saying is
watch your back

13:25.811 --> 13:26.851
when dealing
with the press.

13:26.851 --> 13:29.351
7-Adam-19, 415-fight.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.061
Manager versus customer
in a physical.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.101
Multiple RPs. E&L Auto Body.
3905.

13:34.101 --> 13:36.351
Copy that.
En route, Code 3.

13:36.351 --> 13:38.191
$2,000. That's final.

13:38.191 --> 13:39.901
That's not
what you quoted me!

13:39.901 --> 13:42.481
I'm not giving you
a penny more than $500!

13:42.481 --> 13:45.101
$2,000!
No pay, no car! I keep!

13:45.101 --> 13:46.401
Like hell you will.

13:46.401 --> 13:48.561
Say hello
to William Snakespeare, bitch!

13:48.561 --> 13:50.311
Hey! Drop the snake!
Drop it!

13:50.311 --> 13:51.941
Ohh! Ohh!
Drop the snake!

13:51.941 --> 13:52.901
-Aah!
-Oh.

13:52.901 --> 13:54.981
Get that away from me!
Aah! Aah!

13:54.981 --> 13:56.231
Oh, no.

14:00.061 --> 14:01.311
Where the hell did it go?
I don't know.

14:06.141 --> 14:09.101
Sir, just stay where you are.
The ambulance is on its way.

14:09.101 --> 14:11.271
He's not gonna make it.
Animal control's 10 minutes out.

14:11.271 --> 14:12.271
EMTs won't
step foot in here

14:12.271 --> 14:13.731
until that snake's
been neutralized.

14:13.731 --> 14:16.271
Damn it, well, we can't
stay up here while he's dying.

14:16.271 --> 14:17.271
Alright, we'll just flush it out
in the open.

14:17.271 --> 14:19.191
I'll end it.
You can't kill it.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.191
What the hell are we supposed to
do with it? Snuggle?

14:23.021 --> 14:24.641
Boot, don't be a hero.
It's venomous.

14:45.901 --> 14:47.811
Whoa.

14:55.941 --> 14:58.061
Hey, there, Snakespeare.

14:58.061 --> 15:00.141
It's okay.

15:00.141 --> 15:02.601
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just...

15:02.601 --> 15:05.441
Ohh.

15:05.441 --> 15:06.811
Oh.

15:06.811 --> 15:09.691
Okay.

15:13.351 --> 15:16.271
Hoo! It's not his fault
his owner's an idiot.

15:16.271 --> 15:17.851
Control, advise fire
and ambulance

15:17.851 --> 15:20.521
our scene is Code 4 --
clear to enter.

15:27.771 --> 15:28.401
Can I ask you a favor?

15:28.401 --> 15:30.141
Sure.

15:30.141 --> 15:31.191
No, never mind.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.401
Come on. What is it?

15:33.941 --> 15:36.191
Yeah, this whole
spending the night

15:36.191 --> 15:37.691
at my ex's house
thing is --

15:37.691 --> 15:39.981
You're nervous.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.101
Y-Yeah, yeah,
that one of us is gonna

15:42.101 --> 15:43.561
end up leaving
in a body bag.

15:44.901 --> 15:49.271
It would be nice if I,
you know, had a...buffer.

15:50.981 --> 15:52.981
And you're good at...

15:52.981 --> 15:54.941
people...things.

15:54.941 --> 15:56.231
You know what?
Never mind. Forget it.

15:56.231 --> 15:58.061
This is a bad idea.
No, no, no, it's not.

15:58.061 --> 15:59.811
I just have, uh,
a dinner date with Grace,

15:59.811 --> 16:00.981
but I can reschedule it.

16:00.981 --> 16:02.851
No, no.
Go on your date.

16:02.851 --> 16:04.401
No, it's fine.
I'll be fine.

16:04.401 --> 16:06.271
No, really.
It's not a problem.

16:06.271 --> 16:07.561
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:12.401 --> 16:14.641
Hey, roomie!

16:14.641 --> 16:17.271
Oh, man, I feel like
I haven't seen you in forever!

16:17.271 --> 16:19.561
Well, because you haven't.
Night shifts suck.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.271
Oh.
You try sleeping in our
apartment during the day.

16:21.271 --> 16:24.191
The sirens, construction,
helicopters.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.481
All so Lopez can have
her wine country vacation.

16:26.481 --> 16:27.731
Well, hang in there.

16:27.731 --> 16:30.231
You've only got
one more night of vampire ops.

16:30.231 --> 16:32.101
Then five days off,

16:32.101 --> 16:34.351
and I'll relish
every minute.

16:34.351 --> 16:35.441
Mm-hmm.

16:35.441 --> 16:37.601
Valerie.
Hey, you're back.

16:37.601 --> 16:40.441
Hey. Yes. To thank you for
getting me those CAD reports.

16:40.441 --> 16:42.641
Yeah. Well, did they help
with your story?

16:42.641 --> 16:44.771
You're kidding me.
It's even bigger than I thought.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.481
You know, every one of those
assault victims lives in town.

16:47.481 --> 16:50.061
Who gets a hotel room in
the same city that you live in?

16:50.061 --> 16:53.141
Uh, well, men who are
hooking up with sex workers.

16:53.141 --> 16:55.981
Exactly. I'm convinced
it's a Murphy scam.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.351
You know, the rich guy
meets an escort at the hotel --

16:58.351 --> 17:00.641
Yeah, and gets beaten up and
robbed by her accomplice

17:00.641 --> 17:02.351
but can't report it because
then he'd be copping

17:02.351 --> 17:04.901
to his own crime.
This was the story
that I was looking for

17:04.901 --> 17:06.731
and my editor
said to run with it

17:06.731 --> 17:08.141
and I couldn't have cracked it
without you.

17:08.141 --> 17:11.191
So I want to buy you a drink
to say, you know, thank you.

17:11.191 --> 17:13.310
Oh, uh, I shouldn't.

17:13.310 --> 17:15.521
Why? Because your training
officer would disapprove?

17:15.521 --> 17:18.231
Uh, no, no.
Okay, listen, listen.

17:18.231 --> 17:20.481
You helped me,
and I want to return the favor.

17:20.481 --> 17:22.310
So any time I get any
information on crimes,

17:22.310 --> 17:24.810
I can feed it to you,
and you can make the arrests.

17:32.771 --> 17:35.021
This week has been ass.

17:35.021 --> 17:38.101
I get it.
You're tired. I'm tired.

17:38.101 --> 17:40.021
So tonight,
we're the dream team.

17:40.021 --> 17:41.851
We'll take turns
copping some Z's...

17:41.851 --> 17:43.731
...while the other
keeps their eye on the onboard

17:43.731 --> 17:45.271
and listens for calls.

17:45.271 --> 17:46.601
Wesley excited
about the trip?

17:46.601 --> 17:48.441
That's an understatement.

17:48.441 --> 17:50.731
Guy's got it planned
to the nth degree.

17:50.731 --> 17:53.061
We're gonna get massages,
ride horses,

17:53.061 --> 17:54.521
fly in a hot-air balloon.

17:58.141 --> 17:59.061
Oh, damn.

17:59.061 --> 18:00.521
What?

18:00.521 --> 18:03.191
The boy's gonna propose.

18:03.191 --> 18:03.981
What?

18:03.981 --> 18:05.481
Hot-air balloon?

18:05.481 --> 18:07.271
Proposal.

18:08.901 --> 18:11.061
Shut up. You're wrong.

18:11.061 --> 18:12.811
Okay.

18:18.401 --> 18:21.061
Damn it, you're right.

18:21.061 --> 18:22.521
Salut.

18:22.521 --> 18:26.441
So, you've got a bunch of
victims who aren't talking.

18:26.441 --> 18:27.731
Wrong.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.021
They're not talking
to the police,

18:29.021 --> 18:31.061
but I got one of the guys
to talk to me off the record

18:31.061 --> 18:33.021
this afternoon.
And...?

18:33.021 --> 18:34.731
It's exactly
what I thought.

18:34.731 --> 18:36.731
He hooked up
with a woman online.

18:36.731 --> 18:38.521
They went to a hotel,
they go upstairs,

18:38.521 --> 18:40.601
they get naked,
then a guy walks in with a gun.

18:40.601 --> 18:43.231
He steals the guy's watch,
money, phone,

18:43.231 --> 18:45.061
and then tells him,
"If you talk,

18:45.061 --> 18:46.061
your family's
gonna get hurt."

18:46.061 --> 18:47.191
Did you get
a description?

18:47.191 --> 18:49.271
Better.
He gave me the woman.

18:49.271 --> 18:51.521
Now we're gonna catch her
in the act.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.311
Uh, we-- um...

18:56.311 --> 18:58.021
Y-You lied to me.

18:58.021 --> 19:00.351
No. No, I-I didn't.

19:00.351 --> 19:02.691
I told you
I was gonna help you,

19:02.691 --> 19:04.811
and this way I was
gonna get a killer story

19:04.811 --> 19:07.981
and you were gonna get
a high-profile arrest.
I'm a rookie.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.601
I can't just run around
arresting people by myself.

19:10.601 --> 19:11.691
Come on. Why not?

19:11.691 --> 19:13.561
What?!

19:13.561 --> 19:14.851
Holy crap.

19:15.731 --> 19:16.901
That's Alex Shaw.

19:16.901 --> 19:18.771
Who?
The huge movie producer.

19:18.771 --> 19:20.601
And his wife
is super pregnant.

19:20.601 --> 19:22.271
This is suddenly
a front-page story.

19:22.271 --> 19:24.311
This is amazing!

19:24.311 --> 19:26.101
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They're gonna leave. Let's go.

19:26.101 --> 19:27.691
What?
I booked the room
right next to hers.

19:27.691 --> 19:29.271
Come on!

19:29.271 --> 19:30.731
Let's go, Lucy.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.351
Hey.
Hey.

19:42.351 --> 19:43.441
Just about to
get dinner started.

19:43.441 --> 19:45.441
You hungry?
Um, I could eat.

19:45.441 --> 19:47.521
Hey, Mama.
Hi, baby.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.941
I can take the couch tonight
if you want the bed.

19:49.941 --> 19:51.771
No, sleep in my room.

19:51.771 --> 19:55.981
No, I will take the couch
because I am not here to sleep.

19:55.981 --> 19:57.941
I am here to
keep an eye out, right?

19:57.941 --> 19:59.401
Right.
Right.

19:59.401 --> 20:00.901
Ohh. Wow.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.191
What?
Uh, nothing.

20:02.191 --> 20:04.401
It's just...
a little stiff.

20:04.401 --> 20:05.981
No, it's not.
It's structured.
Mm-hmm.

20:08.981 --> 20:10.691
Did daddy really pick
this couch out himself?

20:10.691 --> 20:13.691
No.
The lady helped him.

20:13.691 --> 20:14.981
What lady?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.061
The lady from the store.

20:17.061 --> 20:18.061
Go wash your hands
for dinner.

20:18.061 --> 20:19.021
Am I in trouble?

20:19.021 --> 20:20.811
Oh, no, honey.

20:20.811 --> 20:22.401
I am.

20:27.771 --> 20:29.101
Don't do that.

20:29.101 --> 20:31.231
Do not use her to get
information about me.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.351
I wa-- I wasn't doing that.
I-I didn't...mean...

20:33.351 --> 20:34.401
You always mean to.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.771
This...

20:38.941 --> 20:40.981
Hey! Here we are!
And we brought dinner!

20:40.981 --> 20:43.481
What?
Uh...

20:43.481 --> 20:45.141
Nolan came to help
with the stakeout.

20:45.141 --> 20:46.351
Yeah, and I brought
a dinner guest.

20:46.351 --> 20:47.941
I hope that's okay.
Hi. I'm Grace.

20:47.941 --> 20:50.351
Uh, Donovan.
Yes, come in, please.

20:50.351 --> 20:52.141
I'll...go get some...
plates for this.

20:52.141 --> 20:53.851
-I'll help.
-Thank you.

20:56.351 --> 20:57.351
Thank you.

20:57.351 --> 20:59.061
No problem.
How's it going?

20:59.061 --> 21:00.901
I think
he's seeing someone.

21:00.901 --> 21:03.141
This place looks
way too nice.

21:03.141 --> 21:05.851
Y-You do know you're divorced,
right?
It's not about that.

21:05.851 --> 21:07.901
It's about him bringing someone
into our child's life

21:07.901 --> 21:09.351
that I have never met.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.521
Okay.

21:14.401 --> 21:15.771
Oh, God. Quick.

21:15.771 --> 21:16.771
Take a selfie with me.

21:19.401 --> 21:21.101
It's too far away.
I can't see their faces.

21:21.101 --> 21:22.231
I need to get closer.
Come on.

21:22.231 --> 21:23.601
Not without blowing it.

21:23.601 --> 21:25.311
What are you doing?

21:25.311 --> 21:26.901
I'm texting Tim.
I need a senior officer here.

21:26.901 --> 21:29.141
No, you don't!
He'll just steal the credit.

21:29.141 --> 21:30.691
Look, I am out on a limb here,
okay?

21:30.691 --> 21:32.271
And as a rookie,
that could get me fired.

21:32.271 --> 21:35.351
So we either do this
by the book or I walk.

21:35.351 --> 21:36.271
Fine.

21:41.561 --> 21:44.061
Your daughter's got
a lot of talent.

21:44.061 --> 21:46.271
Art has been a really great
outlet for her.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.271
It's been a tough year.
For all of us.

21:48.271 --> 21:50.481
But especially for Lila.

21:52.691 --> 21:55.101
Divorce is --
is hard on kids.

21:55.101 --> 21:56.691
I'm going through one myself,

21:56.691 --> 22:00.901
and I feel like every decision
and thought that I make

22:00.901 --> 22:03.231
is built around how it will
affect my son.

22:03.231 --> 22:04.561
He does not believe this,

22:04.561 --> 22:06.311
but, yes,
I feel the exact same way.

22:06.311 --> 22:07.311
Why are you putting words
in my mouth?

22:07.311 --> 22:08.981
Are you saying
that you've never said that?

22:08.981 --> 22:10.231
We're not having this fight
right now.

22:10.231 --> 22:11.481
-Sounds like a good idea.
-Oh, great.

22:11.481 --> 22:13.191
So now
you're taking his side?
Oh, no.

22:13.191 --> 22:16.521
You know what? How about we just
get this out into the open?

22:16.521 --> 22:19.191
You are obviously
allowed to date someone new.

22:19.191 --> 22:21.521
Thank you?
But you should have
introduced me to her

22:21.521 --> 22:24.061
before bringing her
into our daughter's world.

22:24.061 --> 22:25.641
What are you talking about?
I'm not dating anyone.

22:25.641 --> 22:27.191
Okay, so,
I'm just supposed to believe

22:27.191 --> 22:28.731
you redecorated
all by yourself?

22:28.731 --> 22:30.101
Yeah. You are.

22:30.101 --> 22:32.691
You were using towels
as curtains when I met you.

22:32.691 --> 22:34.481
Okay, you know what?

22:34.481 --> 22:36.901
We agreed we would take it slow
and we would give each other

22:36.901 --> 22:39.141
the courtesy of meeting
whomever we were dating.

22:39.141 --> 22:41.271
Again,
not dating anyone.

22:41.271 --> 22:42.851
It really sounds like
he's not dating anyone.

22:42.851 --> 22:46.441
I'm sure before Nolan met your
son, you...talked to your ex.

22:46.441 --> 22:47.811
Actually,
I still haven't met Oliver.

22:47.811 --> 22:50.061
Yeah, there just
hasn't been the right time.

22:50.061 --> 22:53.021
Right, and this is --
it's still new.

22:53.021 --> 22:56.191
It doesn't mean anything.
Yeah.
No, I mean, I know. Yeah.

22:56.191 --> 22:58.731
-
-Yeah. So...

22:58.731 --> 22:59.981
What you guys talking about?

23:04.271 --> 23:07.061
Me? What did I do?
Now I can't relax.

23:07.061 --> 23:09.941
I'm gonna be reading into every
little thing Wesley does,

23:09.941 --> 23:11.601
waiting for him
to propose.

23:11.601 --> 23:13.691
Now I have to be "on"
the whole time,

23:13.691 --> 23:15.731
worrying about what I'm wearing
and how my hair looks.

23:15.731 --> 23:17.521
Okay,
you might be over-thinking this.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.231
He better not propose
on the hot-air balloon.

23:20.561 --> 23:22.441
I get motion sickness.

23:22.441 --> 23:24.231
What if I throw up?

23:24.231 --> 23:26.231
What if I drop the ring
from a thousand feet up?

23:26.231 --> 23:27.811
Okay. You crazy.

23:27.811 --> 23:30.601
And I'm going to sleep.

23:30.601 --> 23:32.691
Thank you so much
for doing this tonight.
Of course.

23:32.691 --> 23:34.691
It was fun.

23:34.691 --> 23:37.521
Okay,
I mean interesting.
Ah.

23:37.521 --> 23:40.401
You know, that seems to be
a theme with our dates --

23:40.401 --> 23:42.271
chasing down stolen cars,

23:42.271 --> 23:44.271
uncomfortable dinners
with your partner.

23:44.271 --> 23:46.101
Maybe next time
you can take me to a funeral.

23:46.101 --> 23:47.641
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds weird.

23:48.851 --> 23:52.601
Listen, um, earlier tonight,
uh, with Oliver...

23:52.601 --> 23:54.441
John, it's not that.
I don't want you --

23:54.441 --> 23:57.401
Thank you
so much for coming.
Ah.

23:57.401 --> 23:59.561
I mean, two buffers is
definitely better than one.

23:59.561 --> 24:02.481
Of course.
Sorry that I have to rush out.

24:02.481 --> 24:04.101
I only have my sitter
until 9:00.

24:04.101 --> 24:05.401
Oh, my God,
now I feel even worse.

24:05.401 --> 24:07.941
You wasted a date night
here?

24:07.941 --> 24:09.811
Don't be silly.
I'm happy to.

24:09.811 --> 24:11.141
Good luck
with everything.

24:11.141 --> 24:12.561
I hope that Lila
is okay.

24:12.561 --> 24:14.641
-Thank you.
-I'll walk you out.

24:17.191 --> 24:18.141
Good night.

24:30.601 --> 24:33.441
Hey, thanks for coming.
Mm-hmm.

24:33.441 --> 24:35.771
I'm in trouble, aren't I?
Mm-hmm.

24:35.771 --> 24:38.401
If he punishes you in any way,
I'll write a story about it.

24:38.401 --> 24:40.191
No, don't do that.
Do not do that.

24:40.191 --> 24:41.601
You know that doesn't work.

24:41.601 --> 24:42.901
But there's an app for it.

24:42.901 --> 24:44.641
Really?
No.

24:44.641 --> 24:45.981
Shaw still in there
with the escort?

24:45.981 --> 24:47.441
Yeah, but there's no sign
of her accomplice.

24:47.441 --> 24:48.441
Maybe he's not coming.

24:48.441 --> 24:49.601
Maybe he doesn't exist.

24:49.601 --> 24:51.061
He exists, okay?

24:51.061 --> 24:53.481
And when he comes, he's gonna be
armed and dangerous.

24:53.481 --> 24:55.021
If so, you'll be
nowhere near the action.

24:58.811 --> 25:01.481
And what if
it's not on the hot-air balloon?

25:01.481 --> 25:02.941
What if he proposes

25:02.941 --> 25:04.811
while we're riding horses
and I fall off?
Okay.

25:04.811 --> 25:06.851
Please just let me
go to sleep!

25:06.851 --> 25:09.691
7-Adam-19,
requesting another unit

25:09.691 --> 25:12.101
to the Coldwater Hotel
for a 647-B event.

25:12.101 --> 25:13.481
Contact me in the lobby.

25:13.481 --> 25:16.101
7-Adam-07, attach us
to 7-Adam-19's event.

25:16.101 --> 25:17.191
Show us en route.

25:19.641 --> 25:20.851
Wow.

25:20.851 --> 25:23.351
Wind is
really picking up.

25:23.351 --> 25:25.141
I'll take the chair.
You take the couch.

25:25.141 --> 25:26.731
Oh, I can't have that.
I'll take the chair.

25:26.731 --> 25:28.641
Trust me, you are getting
the worst end of the deal.

25:28.641 --> 25:30.481
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

25:31.981 --> 25:33.231
Wow.
Right?!

25:33.231 --> 25:34.691
What?! I mean...
I know.

25:36.771 --> 25:38.561
Hey, can we talk about me
for a second?

25:38.561 --> 25:40.021
Yeah, sure.
What do you think it means

25:40.021 --> 25:43.561
that Grace doesn't want me
to meet her son?

25:43.561 --> 25:45.771
Uh, that she's
a good mother

25:45.771 --> 25:47.561
who is putting
her child's welfare

25:47.561 --> 25:49.641
before everything
and everyone else.

25:49.641 --> 25:51.941
So, not that she's...
not that into me?

25:51.941 --> 25:54.101
Are you kidding me?
No. She digs you.

25:54.101 --> 25:56.441
Seems to be
her only flaw.

25:58.231 --> 25:59.021
What?

25:59.021 --> 26:00.811
Uh...

26:00.811 --> 26:02.141
I see a ghost.

26:14.521 --> 26:16.521
Police!
Drop your weapon!

26:17.941 --> 26:20.101
It has to die!

26:20.101 --> 26:22.981
Ma'am, I need you to put
that shotgun down right now.

26:26.561 --> 26:28.141
Turn around.

26:28.141 --> 26:30.311
Hands on your head.
Interlace your fingers.

26:30.311 --> 26:32.231
What the hell
are you doing?

26:32.231 --> 26:33.811
Hunting.
Who?

26:33.811 --> 26:35.351
It.
It?

26:35.351 --> 26:37.691
The coyote
that killed my Snowball.

26:37.691 --> 26:39.521
Your what?
My Westie.

26:39.521 --> 26:41.811
Your dog?
My baby.

26:41.811 --> 26:46.521
We went out for a walk last
night, and a coyote attacked us.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.351
Is that what happened
to your hand?

26:48.351 --> 26:50.061
I tried to get
between them.

26:50.061 --> 26:52.521
I fell. Snowball ran.

26:52.521 --> 26:54.191
She was so scared.

26:54.191 --> 26:57.561
The coyote went after her,
and I haven't seen her since.

26:57.561 --> 26:59.231
That damn jackal!

26:59.231 --> 27:00.691
He -- He murdered her!

27:00.691 --> 27:03.941
I know it!

27:07.561 --> 27:11.061
That's him.
And he's armed.

27:11.061 --> 27:12.481
Dispatch, be advised,

27:12.481 --> 27:14.441
suspect at my location
is armed with a handgun.

27:14.441 --> 27:16.901
White male, 6'2",
black jacket, blue jeans.

27:16.901 --> 27:18.021
Here we go.

27:18.021 --> 27:19.561
Alright, stay...

27:19.561 --> 27:20.771
Where is she?
I don't know.

27:27.101 --> 27:29.311
Ah! Aah!

27:29.311 --> 27:30.271
Hang on!

27:33.561 --> 27:35.141
He's running!

27:35.141 --> 27:36.561
Give me your hand!
Let go of the phone!

we solved the ghost mystery.

28:20.771 --> 28:22.061
Thank you.

28:22.061 --> 28:24.271
And, uh, I can tell Lila
in the morning.

28:24.271 --> 28:26.101
I'd like to peek in on her

28:26.101 --> 28:27.901

28:27.901 --> 28:31.021
Oh, right.
Mm, thank you for, uh --

Scoot over.

28:54.311 --> 28:56.641
We caught your ghost.

28:56.641 --> 29:01.601
It was just a nice lady who was
looking for her lost dog.

29:01.601 --> 29:03.351
Did you help her find it?

29:03.351 --> 29:05.601
I wish we could have,
honey, but we...

29:08.141 --> 29:11.271
I know. It's sad.

29:11.271 --> 29:14.141
Can you stay
till I fall asleep?

29:14.141 --> 29:15.481
Yeah, sure.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.311
Snowball?!

29:33.311 --> 29:35.021
Snowball,
is that you, girl?

29:36.401 --> 29:38.641
Well, we thought
you got eaten by a coyote.

29:38.641 --> 29:40.311
Way to survive!

29:40.311 --> 29:41.561
Come here!

29:41.561 --> 29:43.231
Come here. Hey!

29:43.231 --> 29:44.351
No, don't worry.

29:44.351 --> 29:45.851
It's okay.
I'm a police officer.

29:50.101 --> 29:51.981
Snowball?

29:51.981 --> 29:54.141
Hey.

29:54.141 --> 29:56.641
Hey, there. How you doing?

29:56.641 --> 29:59.401
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
We were worried about you!

29:59.401 --> 30:00.601
You were...

30:26.641 --> 30:28.021
I don't want this.

30:28.021 --> 30:30.311
I didn't want this,
either.

30:31.941 --> 30:33.311
From the looks of it,
neither does he.

30:33.311 --> 30:36.561
Don't talk about Benjamin!
Don't even look at him!

30:36.561 --> 30:39.351
So...

30:39.351 --> 30:40.561
What's happening here?

30:40.561 --> 30:42.561
He tried to leave me.

30:42.561 --> 30:45.191
So I-I needed to show him
that he still loved me.

30:47.311 --> 30:48.191
By drugging him?

30:48.191 --> 30:49.901
He was making
too much noise.

30:49.901 --> 30:52.521
He w-- wouldn't listen.

30:52.521 --> 30:54.271
Now he hears me.

30:54.271 --> 30:56.271
A-And I'm winning him back.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.021
And we were
almost happy again

30:58.021 --> 31:01.021
and then you showed up outside
and I couldn't let you find him.

31:01.021 --> 31:03.021
I -- You can't be here.

31:03.021 --> 31:05.061
Okay, c--
You're gonna ruin everything!

31:05.061 --> 31:07.851
Okay. I'll be happy to leave.
Just untie me, and I'll go.

31:07.851 --> 31:09.351
I'm not stupid.

31:09.351 --> 31:11.811
You're a cop.
I can't just let you go.

31:11.811 --> 31:13.601
We ju--
We can't have you here.

31:13.601 --> 31:15.021
We s--
We need our privacy.

31:24.021 --> 31:25.941
I have to kill you.

31:27.401 --> 31:29.191
Mama?
Mm-hmm?

31:29.191 --> 31:31.641
What if I
still have nightmares?

31:31.641 --> 31:34.351
Well, I told you, honey,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

31:34.351 --> 31:37.311
It wasn't a ghost.
Not about that.

31:38.811 --> 31:42.481
Sometimes I have dreams

31:42.481 --> 31:46.311
that --
that you're getting hurt.

31:46.311 --> 31:48.641
Like at
the grocery store.

31:48.641 --> 31:51.561
Hey.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.061
It's okay.

31:53.061 --> 31:56.021
You know I'm okay,
right?

31:56.021 --> 31:57.851
And that's never
gonna happen again.

32:00.691 --> 32:03.191
Sometimes
back then,

32:03.191 --> 32:06.731
I had to pretend
to be a bad guy.

32:06.731 --> 32:08.401
How come?

32:08.401 --> 32:11.231
So that real bad guys

32:11.231 --> 32:13.941
would tell me all the bad things
they were doing.

32:13.941 --> 32:17.351
And when I found out,
I'd stop them.

32:17.351 --> 32:20.811
Is that why that scary man
at the store was so mad at you?

32:23.021 --> 32:26.141
Yeah, he figured out that
I wasn't really a bad person,

32:26.141 --> 32:30.941
that I was just a good one
who was pretending.

32:30.941 --> 32:33.101
Were you scared?

32:33.101 --> 32:35.771
Yeah. I was.

32:37.981 --> 32:40.941
Until I knew
you were safe.

32:40.941 --> 32:44.191
Because protecting you --

32:44.191 --> 32:46.401
It's all that matters
to me.

32:49.771 --> 32:52.481
Alright, now, get some sleep,
honey. It's late.

32:52.481 --> 32:55.231
And no more bad dreams, okay?

32:56.691 --> 32:57.771
I love you.

33:01.561 --> 33:02.691
Mama?

33:02.691 --> 33:04.021
Yes, Lila?

33:04.021 --> 33:07.481
You said the ghost
was a woman who lost her dog.

33:07.481 --> 33:10.021
But who was the man?

33:10.021 --> 33:11.271
What man, baby?

33:11.271 --> 33:12.601
The one
I heard screaming.

33:16.601 --> 33:19.061
-Ohh.

33:19.061 --> 33:20.641
I need to do this.

33:20.641 --> 33:21.981
For Benjamin.

33:24.021 --> 33:26.141
I love you so much.

33:26.141 --> 33:28.271
I can't lose you.

33:28.271 --> 33:30.021
If you do this --
If you kill me,

33:30.021 --> 33:31.141
you'll lose him,
for sure.

33:31.141 --> 33:33.641
Shut up!

33:33.641 --> 33:37.351
Gah!

33:37.351 --> 33:39.941
What's --
What's wrong with it?

33:39.941 --> 33:41.771
The safety.

33:41.771 --> 33:44.851
Ohh! Aah.

33:44.851 --> 33:45.941
Aah!

33:56.231 --> 33:58.521
Wait! Wait!
It's gonna be loud.

33:58.521 --> 34:00.101
Your neighbors
are gonna hear it.

34:00.101 --> 34:01.691
They'll call the police.

34:05.641 --> 34:07.021
Damn it, he's right.

34:07.021 --> 34:09.351
You're right.
Oh, God.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.190
What am I gonna do?
Benjamin, help me.

34:13.190 --> 34:15.601
I-I could
stab him to death.

34:15.601 --> 34:17.481
Ah, no, no.
All the blood.

34:17.481 --> 34:19.641
Even if I clean it up, they --
they'll find it

34:19.641 --> 34:21.771
because they have the sprays
and -- and the lights and the...

34:23.271 --> 34:24.981
I know.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.690
I could beat you
to death.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.851
No, whoa, whoa! No, no,
that's gonna be a lot of blood.

34:55.851 --> 34:57.811
It's -- Even more
than if you used the knife.

34:57.811 --> 34:58.941
It'll go everywhere.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.981
Damn it!

35:12.351 --> 35:15.191
You die
if you can't breathe.

35:15.191 --> 35:16.691
I know that.

35:16.691 --> 35:21.101
I mean, that's just
basic biology.

35:21.101 --> 35:22.851
Wait! Wait!

35:44.941 --> 35:48.141
Nyla? It's the middle
of the night.
I know.

35:48.141 --> 35:50.941
I'm sorry,
but...

35:50.941 --> 35:52.811
Have you seen my partner?

35:52.811 --> 35:54.641
The guy that I was with
earlier on today?

35:54.641 --> 35:56.021
No. Why?

35:56.021 --> 35:57.231
Because he left the house
a while ago,

35:57.231 --> 35:58.401
and his truck
is still here.

35:58.401 --> 36:00.231
And he's not answering
his cell.

36:00.231 --> 36:02.481
Oh. Weird.

36:07.191 --> 36:09.481
Weird. No, Ben and I have been
asleep for hours.

36:09.481 --> 36:10.851
Haven't seen anything.

36:10.851 --> 36:12.851
Okay. Thank you.

36:12.851 --> 36:14.561
I hope you find him.

36:24.811 --> 36:26.771
That was Nyla.

36:26.771 --> 36:29.351
I really hope
she gets back with Don.

36:29.351 --> 36:31.691
We always had so much fun
with them.

36:31.691 --> 36:32.771
Remember?

36:43.941 --> 36:45.311
Ohh!

36:45.311 --> 36:46.061
Ohh!

36:47.691 --> 36:50.941
Hey. Hey. You alright?

36:50.941 --> 36:52.401
I gotcha. I gotcha.

37:01.771 --> 37:02.941
How's John?

37:02.941 --> 37:06.231
Uh, he might need a couple
stitches and a Valium,

37:06.231 --> 37:08.691
but, um, he'll be okay.

37:08.691 --> 37:10.311
I think it might be time
to move.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.691
This neighborhood's
a mess.

37:13.141 --> 37:15.771
Benjamin and Griffin
were such a great couple.

37:15.771 --> 37:17.601
But so were we
at one point in time.

37:17.601 --> 37:19.901
Oh, come on.
There's no comparison.

37:19.901 --> 37:23.231
We had our dark days, sure, but
never a full psychotic break.

37:23.231 --> 37:26.231
I don't know.
I got close a couple times.

37:26.231 --> 37:28.901
Uh, thank you for...

37:28.901 --> 37:31.271
letting me come tonight.

37:31.271 --> 37:35.061
Thank you for listening
to our daughter.

37:35.061 --> 37:37.691
I should have done
a better job with that.

37:39.441 --> 37:42.441
Are you kidding?

37:42.441 --> 37:44.401
You are a great dad.

straight with you

38:49.481 --> 38:52.851
from the beginning.
You took advantage of me
because I'm a rookie.

38:52.851 --> 38:55.101
You knew that a senior officer
would never have let you

38:55.101 --> 38:56.441

38:56.441 --> 38:58.441
Yes, and it was
very unfair of me,

38:58.441 --> 39:01.691
but, listen,
I've been stuck for so long.

39:01.691 --> 39:03.691
I needed this.

39:03.691 --> 39:06.231

39:06.231 --> 39:08.641
And yet, when push
came to shove,

39:08.641 --> 39:11.101
you went for the tabloid photo
instead of the news story.

39:15.271 --> 39:16.601
Hey, you ready to go?

39:16.601 --> 39:17.901
What?

39:17.901 --> 39:18.811
Now?

39:18.811 --> 39:20.061
Yeah. Why not?

39:20.061 --> 39:21.481
You know, you can sleep
in the car.

39:21.481 --> 39:23.021

the perfect proposal,
but the pressure is killing me.

39:38.771 --> 39:40.601

wrong or I lose the ring

39:40.601 --> 39:42.231

39:43.441 --> 39:49.231

a proposal vacation,

39:49.231 --> 39:50.561
we have
