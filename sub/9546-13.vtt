00:07.293 --> 00:09.371
Jiggle me timbers.

00:09.441 --> 00:10.485
You...

00:10.788 --> 00:12.063
are gorgeous!

00:13.113 --> 00:15.449
And you got
a movie opening up on Friday.

00:15.647 --> 00:17.299
And, by the way, I saw it last night.

00:17.346 --> 00:19.330
Jiggle me timbers!

00:19.696 --> 00:21.410
That was a long 21/2 hours, boy.

00:22.486 --> 00:24.219
Max,
you've been sayin' that all morning.

00:24.254 --> 00:25.514
Where'd you get that.

00:25.515 --> 00:26.906
Maybe it'll be my new catch phrase.

00:26.919 --> 00:29.735
I didn't know I had to clear everything
with the Lollipop Guild.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.461
Careful, boss.

00:31.506 --> 00:33.349
Willie'll beat the crap
out of your kneecaps.

00:33.372 --> 00:35.063
- Or higher, even.
- You guys...

00:35.087 --> 00:36.801
No. I think it'll catch on.

00:36.986 --> 00:39.329
Jiggle meee timbers!!

00:39.883 --> 00:41.820
You're listening
to Mad Max In The Morning.

00:41.855 --> 00:43.996
And we're talking
with Kimberly Dennaman,

00:44.043 --> 00:46.148
whose new movie
is opening everywhere on Friday.

00:46.239 --> 00:47.906
And closing everywhere on Saturday!

00:59.705 --> 01:01.621
- Gas leak.
- I can smell it.

01:01.692 --> 01:02.901
Yeah, shut off the main valve,

01:02.936 --> 01:04.727
but we gotta check inside
just to make sure.

01:04.738 --> 01:05.760
All right.

01:21.910 --> 01:23.114
Right, now.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.830
Is that coming from upstairs?

01:35.831 --> 01:36.862
I hear voices.

01:36.941 --> 01:38.117
Sounds like a radio.

01:44.995 --> 01:46.208
Better check upstairs.

01:46.209 --> 01:47.209
Oh, my God.

01:47.590 --> 01:49.791
That's what's-his-name from the radio.

01:50.721 --> 01:51.721
Max Hudson.

01:52.222 --> 01:54.163
A gas leak at Max Hudson's house?

01:54.175 --> 01:55.950
Oh, he's gonna have
a field day with this!

02:02.391 --> 02:03.439
<i>Tell me, Kimberly,</i>

02:03.440 --> 02:05.825
<i>that you actually believe
in the sanctity of marriage.</i>

02:05.897 --> 02:06.913
<i>I do.</i>

02:06.947 --> 02:08.768
<i>Kimberly can't even spell "sanctity."</i>

02:08.957 --> 02:09.966
I'll turn the gas off.

02:09.967 --> 02:10.967
<i>Say sanctity.</i>

02:11.316 --> 02:12.321
<i>Santity.</i>

02:12.322 --> 02:13.322
<i>Close enough!</i>

02:14.227 --> 02:15.227
<i>Close enough!</i>

02:16.010 --> 02:17.577
<i>We have a winner!</i>

02:22.483 --> 02:24.441
Hey, Max.
There's a cop on line one.

02:24.442 --> 02:25.794
He says it's important.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.247
Okay, uh...

02:28.462 --> 02:30.278
I'll just take it in the back,
all right?

02:30.312 --> 02:31.450
Anybody you know?

02:38.344 --> 02:39.814
My God, is she all right?

02:40.946 --> 02:41.996
Oh, my God...

02:42.403 --> 02:43.997
Is she all right?
Oh, my God.

02:48.112 --> 02:49.112
Speaking.

02:51.464 --> 02:52.464
My wife...?

02:53.964 --> 02:55.669
Oh, my God, is she all right?

02:58.223 --> 02:59.223
Yes, sir.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.240
I- I understand.
I'll be right there.

03:10.093 --> 03:12.384

Mr. Monk Is On The Air

03:12.671 --> 03:15.238
Transcript : swsub.com
Synchro : Sixe

04:05.735 --> 04:07.068
You put the blades up?

04:07.136 --> 04:08.736
That is really interesting.

04:09.199 --> 04:10.942
I'm always afraid
I'll cut myself.

04:11.058 --> 04:12.558
Yeah, I'm a "blade-down" man.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.454
But that's what makes horse races,
am I right?

04:15.504 --> 04:17.050
Doesn't mean we still can't be friends.

04:17.084 --> 04:18.834
Actually, I run them twice.

04:19.014 --> 04:20.837
Blades up and then blades down.

04:20.968 --> 04:22.151
That's fascinating.

04:22.314 --> 04:23.725
Is this dishwasher safe?

04:23.816 --> 04:24.816
Let me just--

04:25.271 --> 04:26.271
Yes, it is.

04:26.420 --> 04:28.596
Funny story: I have a casserole dish.

04:28.671 --> 04:30.175
It was a gift from my sister.

04:30.176 --> 04:31.528
Not the sister you met.

04:31.580 --> 04:35.000
The one who used to live in Milwaukee
but moved to St. Paul last summer.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.208
Well, not summer, per say.

04:37.295 --> 04:39.325
K- Kevin...
It doesn't matter.

04:39.457 --> 04:42.357
Anyway,
the dish didn't say "dishwasher safe,"

04:42.686 --> 04:43.803
but, you know what?

04:44.285 --> 04:45.285
I took a chance.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.673
'Cause you only
go around once in this life.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.440
That's the best news I've heard all day.

04:53.198 --> 04:54.598
I'll finish up.
You get the door.

04:54.599 --> 04:55.599
How's that sound?

05:03.608 --> 05:04.608
Mr. Monk?

05:05.863 --> 05:09.404
I'm sorry to bother you at home,
I read about you on the internet.

05:09.488 --> 05:11.064
And I looked up your address.

05:12.963 --> 05:14.727
I don't know where else to go.

05:16.564 --> 05:17.740
I'm on the internet?

05:24.294 --> 05:25.310
Thank you.

05:28.158 --> 05:29.291
Thank you.

05:34.511 --> 05:37.275
If you could wait
until my assistant gets here.

05:37.468 --> 05:40.265
She's in charge
of saying the right things.

05:40.471 --> 05:42.827
Adrian,
I'm putting the tablespoons in front

05:42.860 --> 05:44.790
and the serving spoons in back.
Any objections?

05:44.791 --> 05:46.976
Kevin, it doesn't matter.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.812
My sister, Jeanette,
died four weeks ago.

05:52.555 --> 05:54.777
- There was a gas fireplace in--
- Excuse me.

05:55.911 --> 05:59.816
Actually, I do prefer
the serving spoons in the front.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.017
Really?
In the front?

06:02.527 --> 06:04.307
Okay, you're the boss.

06:06.903 --> 06:07.920
Sorry.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.232
There was a fireplace...?

06:09.233 --> 06:11.644
There was a gas fireplace
in the bedroom.

06:12.284 --> 06:16.119
It was turned on,
and she was asphyxiated.

06:17.855 --> 06:21.281
This is a copy
of the coroner's inquest.

06:21.829 --> 06:23.629
They said it was an accident.

06:23.764 --> 06:26.573
But, Mr. Monk,
Jeanette never used that fireplace.

06:26.574 --> 06:27.809
I know he killed her.

06:28.483 --> 06:30.337
- Who?
- Her husband-- Max.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.896
Getting a divorce
would have cost him $30 million.

06:33.463 --> 06:35.063
I'm sorry.
Could I have another?

06:36.669 --> 06:37.785
Here's the thing.

06:40.355 --> 06:44.738
I buy ten boxes at a time, and...
they have to last me the whole month.

06:50.319 --> 06:51.319
So... okay.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.113
Thanks.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.634
Okay, I'm pouring the detergent.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.895
- You're missing it.
- Kevin, please.

07:10.979 --> 07:12.609
Please, I'm trying to talk to--

07:12.636 --> 07:14.576
- I'm sorry.
- Linda Riggs.

07:14.633 --> 07:16.533
Jeanette Hudson was my sister.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.970
Jeanette Hudson?

07:18.189 --> 07:19.968
Max Hudson's wife?

07:21.603 --> 07:23.470
Yeah, everyone thinks he's so funny.

07:24.399 --> 07:25.999
Jeanette was terrified of him.

07:26.257 --> 07:28.786
You know,
he once got arrested for assault.

07:29.109 --> 07:30.477
He has a terrible temper.

07:30.557 --> 07:32.557
- So you've actually met him?
- Kevin.

07:32.816 --> 07:33.864
Yes I've met him.

07:33.865 --> 07:35.464
I think he killed my sister.

07:35.465 --> 07:36.465
What's he like?

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
He's a monster!

07:40.474 --> 07:42.078
Forget it.
Withdrawn.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.379
Never said it.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.874
Excuse me.
I have dishes to do.

07:51.857 --> 07:54.099
Well, I don't like that guy either.
He's such a bully.

07:54.149 --> 07:56.228
- Have you ever heard his show?
- I don't think so.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.397
What station is he on?

07:57.398 --> 07:58.398
99.9.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.420
Ahhh... so close.

08:00.459 --> 08:02.209
I just don't see how
he could have done it.

08:02.242 --> 08:03.515
Have you looked at this?

08:03.659 --> 08:07.549
So when Jeanette died,
Max was on the radio doing a live show.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.915
And the night before,
he's in Los Angeles at a party.

08:09.916 --> 08:11.216
He hasn't been home in two days.

08:11.217 --> 08:13.370
I promised her sister I'd look into it.

08:13.371 --> 08:15.761
I had to.
She was using up all my Kleenex.

08:16.027 --> 08:17.027
Hi.

08:17.226 --> 08:18.559
I don't think he's home.

08:20.176 --> 08:21.940
Did you tell him I was coming?

08:22.635 --> 08:24.023
No, Mr. Monk,
That's not for you.

08:24.056 --> 08:25.133
That's a joke.

08:25.741 --> 08:26.741
It's a joke?

08:27.189 --> 08:28.189
How-- how is--

08:28.190 --> 08:29.248
How is that funny?

08:30.246 --> 08:31.696
Well, I guess it's funny

08:31.763 --> 08:35.423
because it says the opposite of what
a Welcome Mat would normally say.

08:36.102 --> 08:37.868
So it's an opposite joke.

08:38.508 --> 08:39.625
Yeah, that's right.

08:40.462 --> 08:41.595
He's not home.

08:42.539 --> 08:45.540
I live right there.
I saw him leave about two hours ago.

08:46.614 --> 08:47.672
That's a nice dog.

08:47.770 --> 08:48.770
Well, thank you.

08:49.125 --> 08:50.183
That's a nice cat.

08:52.335 --> 08:53.551
Come on.
Let's go.

08:55.089 --> 08:56.089
That's it.

08:56.191 --> 08:57.496
This is still my sister's home.

08:57.497 --> 08:58.497
I'm going in.

09:11.628 --> 09:13.275
This is where she was found.

09:13.672 --> 09:14.672
On the bed.

09:15.575 --> 09:17.758
This morning,
I heard him joking about it on his show.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.286
I don't know how somebody can joke
about something like that?

09:20.287 --> 09:21.287
I don't know.

09:21.387 --> 09:23.887
Anytime I'm at a restaurant
or a store and he's on the radio,

09:23.888 --> 09:25.123
I just have to leave.

09:26.294 --> 09:29.201
According to the police,
Jeanette turned on the gas,

09:29.255 --> 09:32.772
then forgot that it was on
and just went to sleep.

09:35.317 --> 09:36.317
What?

09:36.922 --> 09:39.110
There's only 39 shoes here.

09:39.144 --> 09:41.322
- There's one missing.
- Is that important right now?

09:41.411 --> 09:44.378
It looks like a dark-brown
Ramato loafer.

09:44.682 --> 09:47.229
It's about a size 101/2 or 11, I guess.

09:49.512 --> 09:51.030
- That's a 101/2.
- Okay.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.675
So, Mr. Monk,
Jeanette was found here.

09:54.745 --> 09:55.812
Okay.

10:00.876 --> 10:04.010
So she turned it... like this?

10:06.192 --> 10:07.742
And then forgot it was on?

10:10.319 --> 10:11.319
No.

10:18.509 --> 10:20.035
Mr. Monk, are you okay?

10:20.116 --> 10:21.250
That's gas.

10:21.836 --> 10:23.420
Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine.

10:23.572 --> 10:26.089
It's just a little-- a little gas.

10:27.199 --> 10:29.022
According to the police report,

10:29.246 --> 10:31.370
the flue was-- was-- was closed?

10:31.748 --> 10:32.748
Right.

10:32.850 --> 10:33.850
Right.

10:34.510 --> 10:35.710
It's closed.

10:41.366 --> 10:42.383
Look at this.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.134
It's just...

10:46.350 --> 10:48.084
dried out--

10:50.489 --> 10:51.489
Dried...

10:52.138 --> 10:53.288
Dried leaves.

10:54.799 --> 10:57.387
Fire would have burned them
or charred them.

10:58.545 --> 11:01.780
No, no. This thing
hasn't been used in months, if ever.

11:01.938 --> 11:03.105
That's what I was saying.

11:03.106 --> 11:05.106
It couldn't have been an accident.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.675
- You have the inventory there?
- Yes.

11:14.796 --> 11:18.993
Are there any matches
or cigarette lighters in the room?

11:19.801 --> 11:20.801
No.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.670
No matches anywhere.
That makes no sense.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.540
She died on the 15th?

11:37.899 --> 11:39.007
Yeah, that's right.

11:39.008 --> 11:41.577
Two days before
her tenth wedding anniversary.

11:41.756 --> 11:43.357
They always did something special.

11:43.358 --> 11:44.358
Go on a big trip.

11:44.461 --> 11:45.864
Last year they went to Cabo.

11:45.865 --> 11:46.865
Not this year.

11:47.417 --> 11:52.138
Look, July 17th, "Tenth anniversary".

11:52.271 --> 11:53.475
Natalie, Nothing's written.

11:53.476 --> 11:54.476
Nothing planned.

11:55.326 --> 11:56.326
Nothing erased.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.656
He knew she wouldn't be around.

12:01.491 --> 12:03.138
Linda, I think you're right.

12:03.992 --> 12:05.286
I think he killed her.

12:10.549 --> 12:14.153
I'm going to be down at the Book Barn
on Market Street tomorrow,

12:14.154 --> 12:15.855
signing copies of my new book-

12:15.856 --> 12:17.973
Sex, Lies, and Radio.

12:18.008 --> 12:19.614
So come on down.
But get there early.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.767
I was at a book signing
in Dallas last week.

12:21.768 --> 12:23.885
And, I mean, it was freakin' insane.

12:24.074 --> 12:26.376
It was a riot.
It was on the news and everything.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.614
It's an amazing book.

12:27.676 --> 12:29.201
Like you know.
You can't even read!

12:29.232 --> 12:30.731
- You didn't read it.
- That's true.

12:30.732 --> 12:31.841
I'm waiting for the movie.

12:31.842 --> 12:33.769
- I read it, boss. Twice.
- Kiss ass.

12:34.419 --> 12:35.652
... my master plan.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.940
You have to be very careful.
He's very quick.

12:37.941 --> 12:39.843
- I'm quick.
- No, Mr. Monk. You're not quick.

12:39.844 --> 12:42.087
You have to focus.
He'll try to make fun of you.

12:42.154 --> 12:43.916
Why? He doesn't even know me.

12:43.966 --> 12:45.395
Howard Stern, if you're listening--

12:45.428 --> 12:47.277
and I know you are--
you're going down.

12:47.409 --> 12:48.576
Goin' down.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.557
Bill, from San Diego,
you're on the air.

12:56.106 --> 12:57.115
Please don't do that.

12:57.664 --> 12:59.741
<i>It was amazing.
It changed my life.</i>

13:00.558 --> 13:01.608
Yeah, thanks. Micky?

13:01.878 --> 13:03.768
Micky, who the hell is that?

13:04.097 --> 13:05.130
His name is Adrian Monk.

13:05.131 --> 13:06.385
He says you invited him down.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.586
Oh! Yeah.

13:07.853 --> 13:08.869
The private dick.

13:09.738 --> 13:12.267
My sister-in-law
hired a private detective.

13:12.498 --> 13:13.832
What's he doing to Mr. Limpey?

13:14.321 --> 13:15.771
Uh, excuse me, Monk?

13:18.054 --> 13:19.121
Please, don't.

13:21.380 --> 13:23.313
A little freak's show
in our control room.

13:23.482 --> 13:24.549
Fight! Fight!

13:24.670 --> 13:25.887
A left, a right.

13:29.656 --> 13:31.639
He killed Mr. Limpey!

13:32.123 --> 13:33.290
Get in here!

13:33.394 --> 13:35.096
Let's go!
He's a maniac.

13:35.199 --> 13:36.240
Do not go in there.

13:36.618 --> 13:38.265
Get in here, buddy.
Come on, Monk.

13:38.314 --> 13:39.898
Hey, Detective,
you want to talk to me?

13:39.932 --> 13:42.122
Now's your chance, okay?
It's now or never.

13:42.123 --> 13:43.172
Don't be afraid of me.

13:43.173 --> 13:45.323
- I won't bite ya.
- I'm the one that bites!

13:47.005 --> 13:48.775
Whoa, start.
Come on.

13:49.364 --> 13:50.548
I'm just gonna talk
to him.

13:50.601 --> 13:51.852
I talk to people all the time.

13:51.885 --> 13:53.386
Yeah, yeah.
But these aren't people.

13:53.387 --> 13:55.316
- Here he comes, eventually.
- The sleeves.

13:55.317 --> 13:56.916
- Look at the sleeves.
- Come on.

14:00.241 --> 14:02.425
Hello, there.
Hello.

14:02.528 --> 14:05.277
- Who is this?
- This is Natalie. She's my assistant.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.607
Ooh, nice.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.760
Do a little twirl, Natalie.

14:10.843 --> 14:13.126
- No, thank you.
- "No, thank you." Okay, she's feisty.

14:13.409 --> 14:14.559
She's brassy.

14:14.661 --> 14:16.562
She's sassy.
She's got gusto!

14:16.666 --> 14:18.863
Sassy, brassy,
but she won't show her assy.

14:18.864 --> 14:19.864
I like it.

14:19.917 --> 14:20.921
Doin' a neck crank.

14:20.922 --> 14:22.904
You can't see it, ladies and gentlemen.

14:22.942 --> 14:24.492
Yeah, I talked to this guy last night.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.962
He wants to talk to me
about what happened to Jeanette.

14:26.974 --> 14:28.753
Why don't we talk about that
after the show?

14:28.786 --> 14:29.986
You don't get it, sugar bumps.

14:29.987 --> 14:30.987
He is the show!

14:31.131 --> 14:32.466
My life is the show.

14:32.516 --> 14:34.338
Detective,
why don't you have a seat, please?

14:34.339 --> 14:36.717
- Somebody give him some headphones.
- There you go, buddy.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.675
Please don't do this.
It's okay.

14:39.009 --> 14:40.509
Please, be careful.

14:42.430 --> 14:44.340
Wipe.
Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe.

14:49.045 --> 14:51.145
Okay, folks.
Uh, folks, you gotta see this.

14:51.385 --> 14:53.713
First of all, his shirt
is buttoned up to his eyeballs.

14:53.747 --> 14:56.826
And he's swabbing
at his headphones with a baby wipe.

14:56.888 --> 14:58.220
This is not a baby wipe.

14:58.371 --> 15:00.547
This is--
This is an adult wipe.

15:00.661 --> 15:01.890
I stand corrected.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.630
You gotta know the difference.

15:03.631 --> 15:04.631
Sorry about that.

15:05.032 --> 15:06.584
Hey, Adrian,
let me ask you something.

15:06.585 --> 15:07.990
When you go to a crime scene,

15:07.991 --> 15:10.274
do you take a police car
or a short yellow bus?

15:10.307 --> 15:11.949
Mr. Monk,
you don't have to answer that.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.747
No. I'll be happy to--
I'll be happy to answer that.

15:15.675 --> 15:16.725
Natalie drives me.

15:16.889 --> 15:17.989
I bet she does.

15:18.415 --> 15:19.599
She's drivin' me, baby.

15:19.633 --> 15:20.659
Who's drivin' Natalie?

15:20.660 --> 15:21.700
I wanna change your tires.

15:24.778 --> 15:25.795
You're hurting me.

15:27.668 --> 15:29.752
This guy is great.
He's-- he's possessed.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.125
"Yo! Adrian!"

15:35.086 --> 15:36.103
What?

15:36.153 --> 15:38.427
Okay, we just lost a third
of our audience.

15:38.464 --> 15:40.537
All rightee, then.
So, just for the record,

15:40.538 --> 15:42.427
you're here because
of my sister-in-law--

15:42.444 --> 15:43.727
"Loony Linda."
That's right.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.911
Loony Linda,
who thinks I murdered my wife.

15:46.966 --> 15:48.009
Isn't that charming?

15:48.010 --> 15:49.833
So what do you think, Mr. Monk?

15:51.165 --> 15:52.223
Are we on the air?

15:52.570 --> 15:53.923
Yeah, we're on the air, buddy.

15:53.924 --> 15:54.924
It's okay.

15:54.972 --> 15:56.795
I have no secrets from my fans.

15:57.169 --> 15:58.395
Oh, I think you do.

15:59.908 --> 16:00.925
Cool, okay.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.438
So you think I murdered my wife,

16:03.484 --> 16:08.774
even though I was right here,
on the air, live, when she died?

16:08.891 --> 16:11.065
Well, I do have a few questions.

16:11.332 --> 16:13.097
- Of course.
- From what I've seen,

16:13.098 --> 16:17.279
it seems unlikely
that bedroom fireplace was ever used.

16:17.403 --> 16:19.005
According to the crime scene photos,

16:19.006 --> 16:22.026
the fireplace flue was closed,
and there were no matches anywhere.

16:22.059 --> 16:23.059
Okay, that's great.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.548
That's very compelling,
compelling cross-examination.

16:25.582 --> 16:26.665
How's this?

16:27.227 --> 16:28.989
You can ask me three questions,

16:29.170 --> 16:32.779
which I will answer right here
in front of 4 million witnesses,

16:32.780 --> 16:35.971
if Natalie sits on Willie's lap.

16:37.214 --> 16:38.248
Please.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.063
Don't do it, Natalie.
It's a trick.

16:41.148 --> 16:42.982
- Do it.
- I thought you'd like to know

16:42.990 --> 16:45.766
that the last guy who wore
those headphones had head lice.

16:46.121 --> 16:47.144
Wipe! Wipe!

16:47.202 --> 16:48.554
Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe.

16:53.234 --> 16:54.675
You should be ashamed of yourself.

16:54.725 --> 16:57.390
I agree. I should be.
But I'm not.

16:58.241 --> 17:00.297
- And there she goes.
- And there we got the view.

17:00.347 --> 17:01.418
She gave us a twirl.

17:01.445 --> 17:02.947
- I think he's the guy.
- I do too.

17:02.972 --> 17:05.512
- At least I hope he is.
- Max Hudson, the jerk on the radio?

17:05.555 --> 17:06.965
According to her sister,

17:07.107 --> 17:09.805
his wife had recently
started taking sleeping pills,

17:09.806 --> 17:11.848
- 30 milligrams.
- Which is the maximum dosage...

17:11.882 --> 17:13.404
And it was Max's suggestion.

17:13.454 --> 17:15.715
He called the doctor personally
to get the prescription.

17:15.717 --> 17:17.516
Here's what happened:
Max is out of town.

17:17.517 --> 17:18.752
It's a perfect alibi.

17:18.767 --> 17:21.223
He knows his wife
is gonna take those pills,

17:21.223 --> 17:22.459
so she's out cold--

17:22.476 --> 17:23.526
Something funny?

17:24.444 --> 17:25.477
No.
Sorry.

17:26.181 --> 17:28.131
He knows his wife won't be waking up.

17:28.132 --> 17:29.926
So he has one of his guys--

17:30.002 --> 17:31.018
Randy?

17:31.585 --> 17:33.673
Do you want to share it
with the rest of the class?

17:33.789 --> 17:36.298
I'm sorry.
I heard you on the show.

17:36.379 --> 17:37.596
You really got zung.

17:37.893 --> 17:39.652
Oh, my God, you listen to that creep?

17:39.653 --> 17:40.703
I think he's great...

17:41.823 --> 17:44.003
it's grating.
De-grating.

17:44.004 --> 17:45.345
Degrading to women.

17:45.812 --> 17:48.810
Yeah, I keep listening,
hoping he'll grow up, but he never does.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.017
Anyway, one of his guys--

17:51.018 --> 17:52.414
Goons.
They're called Goons.

17:52.415 --> 17:54.370
- The Goon Platoon.
- Goons.

17:54.437 --> 17:55.913
One of his Goons--
thank you--

17:55.917 --> 17:58.533
snuck into the house,
turns on the gas--

17:58.583 --> 17:59.797
It could have been J. J.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.028
The guy's a joke machine.

18:01.029 --> 18:02.387
He's been with Max for 15 years.

18:02.388 --> 18:03.482
Since Philadelphia.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.953
Whoever it was, turned on the gas,
closed the bedroom door.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.270
She never woke up.

18:08.851 --> 18:10.167
How did they get in the house?

18:10.168 --> 18:11.462
Max made an extra key.

18:11.521 --> 18:13.421
It sounds good, but it doesn't track.

18:13.422 --> 18:14.422
This is new.

18:14.578 --> 18:16.024
It's from the security company.

18:16.025 --> 18:17.880
That house is wired.

18:18.182 --> 18:20.632
It's monitored 24-7, sealed tight.

18:20.698 --> 18:23.775
No door or window
was opened all night long.

18:23.850 --> 18:26.329
No one-- no thing--
came in or out.

18:26.351 --> 18:28.263
What about that window?
It says "open".

18:29.156 --> 18:31.406
That is a ventilation window
to the basement.

18:31.407 --> 18:32.759
It only opens 8 inches.

18:33.337 --> 18:34.362
Little Willie!

18:34.363 --> 18:35.363
Who?

18:35.567 --> 18:36.869
Little Willie-- He's a...

18:36.870 --> 18:37.870
little person.

18:38.571 --> 18:39.919
He'd do anything for Max.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.508
Last week,
he ate his own weight in bologna.

18:43.577 --> 18:45.539
Jiggle me timbers!

18:46.579 --> 18:47.980
I think I just solved the case!

18:47.981 --> 18:49.157
"Jiggle me timbers"?

18:49.283 --> 18:50.916
Yeah, that's something that Ma--

18:51.449 --> 18:52.451
I heard on the radio.

18:52.452 --> 18:53.648
I don't remember who says it.

18:53.649 --> 18:54.649
I don't know.

18:54.803 --> 18:56.855
I mean,
we don't even know if a little person

18:56.856 --> 18:58.306
can get through an 8-inch window.

18:58.307 --> 18:59.307
Sure they could.

19:00.361 --> 19:01.453
It's awful small.

19:01.503 --> 19:03.601
Could a little person
fit through an 8-inch window?

19:03.651 --> 19:05.289
I am proud to say I don't know.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.405
Look, we don't even know

19:06.455 --> 19:08.739
where this Little Willie person
was the night she died.

19:08.757 --> 19:10.451
Wait a minute.
We can settle it right now.

19:10.468 --> 19:12.178
They're all downtown at a book signing.

19:12.179 --> 19:14.064
We go down, we talk to Little Willie.

19:14.193 --> 19:16.110
If we get a chance--
if it happens to come up--

19:16.143 --> 19:18.093
we measure
the circumference of his head.

19:18.588 --> 19:19.823
Then divide it by pi.

19:19.938 --> 19:20.938
Or something.

19:23.308 --> 19:24.366
What do you think?

19:26.822 --> 19:28.704
I think we have to check it out.

19:39.113 --> 19:40.275
See that guy over there?

19:40.292 --> 19:42.792
He's on the show all the time.
They call him "The Burpinator."

19:42.801 --> 19:44.450
Really?
The Burpinator is here?

19:44.451 --> 19:47.119
Is he single?
Do you think you could introduce me?

19:47.255 --> 19:48.255
Yeah...

19:48.307 --> 19:49.307
Sure, come on.

19:49.417 --> 19:50.467
I was kidding.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.200
You knew that, right--
I was kidding?

19:53.522 --> 19:54.522
Come on, Randy.

19:54.836 --> 19:56.306
Let's get this over with.

19:58.332 --> 19:59.332
William Karelli?

19:59.854 --> 20:00.887
That's me.

20:00.970 --> 20:02.155
Hey. Word with you?

20:05.576 --> 20:08.128
I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.
This is Lieutenant Disher.

20:08.194 --> 20:09.294
We're big fans.

20:10.702 --> 20:12.054
Not-- not "big" height.

20:12.435 --> 20:14.435
Just I love the show.

20:15.572 --> 20:17.856
We are looking into the death
of Jeanette Hudson.

20:17.943 --> 20:19.276
Why?
There was an inquest.

20:19.277 --> 20:20.394
It was an accident.

20:20.432 --> 20:22.929
- Don't you guys talk to each other?
- You're probably right.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.341
There's just a few loose ends
that, uh...

20:25.630 --> 20:26.973
we want look into.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.690
Where were you the night she died?

20:29.992 --> 20:31.559
Where was I?
I was on the air.

20:31.611 --> 20:34.040
No. I mean before that,
the, uh, the night before.

20:34.468 --> 20:36.170
I know Max was in Los Angeles.

20:36.171 --> 20:37.333
But you didn't go with him.

20:37.334 --> 20:38.334
That's true.

20:38.523 --> 20:40.111
I was with my wife and kid.

20:40.529 --> 20:42.075
I got nothing more to say to you guys.

20:42.076 --> 20:43.689
You want to talk, talk to my lawyer.

20:43.939 --> 20:45.560
I'm not done talkin' to you yet.

20:49.085 --> 20:50.936
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, man.

20:51.447 --> 20:52.447
I'm a big fan.

20:52.497 --> 20:54.197
I just--
Nice to meet you.

20:58.402 --> 20:59.452
Tape measure.

20:59.807 --> 21:00.829
Hold on. Hold on.

21:00.853 --> 21:02.286
It was right here.
Hold on.

21:02.353 --> 21:03.353
Hurry up!

21:04.845 --> 21:06.379
- You're moving your hands.
- I'm not.

21:06.406 --> 21:08.840
I don't know what the hell this is,
but it isn't police work.

21:08.856 --> 21:09.864
"101/2 inches."

21:10.175 --> 21:11.175
What?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.575
- He's not the guy.
- And we're all going to Hell.

21:14.794 --> 21:16.277
Just... wait here.

21:18.783 --> 21:19.883
Do it again.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.790
Oh, well, well, well.

21:25.850 --> 21:27.338
The Defective Detective.

21:30.963 --> 21:32.103
You're not gonna like it.

21:32.104 --> 21:33.806
I know.
I read a couple of pages.

21:33.857 --> 21:37.741
It's nothing but toilet talk
and opposite jokes, right?

21:37.864 --> 21:39.663
So how would you like me to sign it?

21:39.664 --> 21:41.678
How about "I confess"?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.121
I'll be taking a little break.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.326
Come with me.

21:55.349 --> 21:58.923
You don't think what happened
to Jeanette was an accident, do you?

22:01.527 --> 22:05.049
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
Just between us, man to... man,

22:06.471 --> 22:10.109
I loved Jeanette...
but she was sick.

22:10.682 --> 22:12.387
She was clinically depressed.

22:13.231 --> 22:14.231
Depressed?

22:15.141 --> 22:16.893
Her own family didn't even know.

22:16.894 --> 22:19.545
She turned on the gas,
and closed the door, and--

22:19.598 --> 22:21.419
- Suicide.
- Yeah, I tried everything.

22:22.256 --> 22:23.373
See? You happy now?

22:24.451 --> 22:27.194
Was she seeing a doctor,
a psychiatrist?

22:27.311 --> 22:28.487
Nah. She never went.

22:28.561 --> 22:29.561
She wouldn't go.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.037
And she didn't even tell her sister?

22:33.317 --> 22:35.801
And you dealt
with this clinical depression

22:35.834 --> 22:37.518
by mocking her on the air

22:37.901 --> 22:40.959
and not making any plans
for your anniversary?

22:42.489 --> 22:43.547
I'm not buying it.

22:45.605 --> 22:46.605
You killed her.

22:47.556 --> 22:48.556
How?

22:50.009 --> 22:51.963
How could I possibly have killed her?

22:52.119 --> 22:53.985
The house was locked.
I was on the radio.

22:55.119 --> 22:56.236
I don't know... yet.

22:57.223 --> 22:59.228
- According to your publicist--
- No. That's it.

22:59.229 --> 23:02.717
That's it. You have any questions
for me, you talk to my lawyer.

23:03.582 --> 23:04.582
Unless...

23:05.735 --> 23:07.502
you want to come back on the show.

23:08.490 --> 23:09.540
On the show?

23:09.541 --> 23:12.395
I'll talk to you anytime
about anything on the air.

23:12.396 --> 23:13.925
What about Monday morning?

23:20.152 --> 23:21.314
I didn't think so.

23:25.561 --> 23:26.661
Wipe, wipe!

23:28.108 --> 23:29.446
Here's the Wipe Guy!

23:34.040 --> 23:36.007
Well, I think our work here is done.

23:43.780 --> 23:46.363
Mr. Monk, come on.
You have to call the Captain.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.649
I can't hear you.

23:49.477 --> 23:52.282
You heard me.
If you think Max Hudson killed his wife,

23:52.283 --> 23:53.834
then we need to call the Captain.

23:53.835 --> 23:54.893
And tell him what?

23:55.435 --> 23:56.435
I have no proof.

23:56.594 --> 23:58.387
Okay, let me see if I understand.

23:58.388 --> 23:59.743
One: you need proof.

24:00.293 --> 24:02.495
One-A: to get this proof,

24:02.552 --> 24:04.058
you need to talk to your suspect.

24:04.509 --> 24:05.576
One-B:

24:05.609 --> 24:08.112
your suspect won't talk to you
unless you go on his show.

24:08.246 --> 24:09.863
One-C: omitted.

24:11.419 --> 24:13.875
Two--
you're afraid to go back on the show

24:13.876 --> 24:15.624
because you think
he might embarrass you.

24:17.226 --> 24:18.226
I'm not afraid.

24:18.527 --> 24:20.229
I'm terrified.
There's a big difference.

24:20.230 --> 24:21.641
You heard what happened.

24:22.182 --> 24:23.361
It was a massacre.

24:23.387 --> 24:24.948
They ripped me apart in there.

24:25.032 --> 24:27.644
I felt like I was back in seventh grade.

24:27.698 --> 24:29.296
Okay, then the next time you go on,

24:29.297 --> 24:30.451
you'll know what to expect.

24:30.452 --> 24:33.575
No. It won't help
because I can't fight back.

24:33.649 --> 24:35.813
I'm just... not funny.

24:35.855 --> 24:37.857
- I'm not funny.
- Mr. Monk, that is not true.

24:37.858 --> 24:39.566
Natalie,
you've known me for three years.

24:39.599 --> 24:41.340
Have I ever said anything funny?

24:47.082 --> 24:49.279
Kevin, have I ever said anything funny?

24:49.362 --> 24:50.429
That's a good question.

24:50.462 --> 24:51.588
Okay. Let's see.

24:51.637 --> 24:55.098
I met you in October, 1998.

24:55.142 --> 24:56.265
First week...

24:56.298 --> 24:58.342
No.
You were kind of a Gloomy Gus.

24:58.970 --> 25:00.036
Second week...

25:08.864 --> 25:09.864
No.

25:09.971 --> 25:10.971
Third week...

25:13.680 --> 25:15.097
- What?
- Yes!

25:15.780 --> 25:17.080
The--
Wait.

25:17.330 --> 25:19.077
Sorry.
No, that wasn't you.

25:19.125 --> 25:20.301
It was Arsenio Hall.

25:20.932 --> 25:22.032
He's hilarious.

25:22.279 --> 25:23.455
It's like a blind spot.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.610
It's like everybody else in the world

25:26.792 --> 25:29.777
can speak another language
that I can't learn.

25:30.297 --> 25:31.572
Maybe it's genetic.

25:31.829 --> 25:34.496
I don't remember my parents
ever laughing.

25:34.603 --> 25:36.779
Okay, Mr. Monk, that is not possible.

25:36.809 --> 25:37.868
Everybody laughs.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.559
You're just blocking it out.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.279
Sit down.

25:43.372 --> 25:45.383
Sit down.
I want to show you something.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.712
Sit down.

25:49.658 --> 25:50.658
These...

25:51.366 --> 25:55.838
are home movies my brother Ambrose
edited together for me.

25:55.916 --> 25:57.466
Oh, what a treat.

25:57.569 --> 25:59.438
Mr. Monk, I love home movies.

25:59.931 --> 26:02.893
They always make me feel better
about my own family.

26:10.587 --> 26:12.137
- Is that you?
- Adorable.

26:12.203 --> 26:13.220
Look at you!

26:13.270 --> 26:14.637
That's my Aunt Clara.

26:22.836 --> 26:24.069
Did somebody die?

26:25.117 --> 26:26.175
Christmas morning.

26:30.199 --> 26:32.949
Oh, that's me playing Hide.

26:33.358 --> 26:34.841
You mean Hide-and-Seek?

26:37.082 --> 26:38.905
You still don't get it, do you?

26:42.125 --> 26:45.525
This--
this one is my cousin's birthday party.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.666
And... There's me.

26:51.474 --> 26:52.879
Got a balloon there.

27:01.185 --> 27:03.318
I don't... remember his name.

27:10.950 --> 27:13.684
Oh, and... family picnic.

27:15.237 --> 27:16.337
There's Ambrose.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.120
Oh, there's more.

27:24.167 --> 27:25.630
There's-- there's a lot more.

27:25.631 --> 27:28.434
That's the saddest movie
I've ever seen.

27:32.659 --> 27:34.164
I'm not hugging you.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.450
I'm hugging the little boy
in that movie.

27:40.890 --> 27:42.407
I am so sorry.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.046
Kevin, what time is it?

28:03.203 --> 28:05.261
Did I ever tell you about my uncle?

28:06.203 --> 28:07.203
No.

28:07.355 --> 28:08.538
Sy Dorfman?

28:10.163 --> 28:11.163
The comedian?

28:11.710 --> 28:12.710
Sy Dorfman?

28:14.764 --> 28:16.266
You've heard of Milton Berle, right?

28:16.267 --> 28:18.127
- Uncle Miltie?
- Yeah.

28:18.296 --> 28:20.457
Well, they were contemporaries!

28:20.743 --> 28:22.498
Worked a lot of the same venues,

28:22.499 --> 28:24.322
had a lot of friends in common.

28:24.347 --> 28:25.347
Take a seat.

28:26.150 --> 28:27.150
Come on.

28:33.513 --> 28:36.630
When I think about
all the great Milton Berle stories

28:37.265 --> 28:41.399
they would tell Uncle Sy
and then he would relay to me.

28:43.085 --> 28:46.776
And when he died... he left me this.

28:51.454 --> 28:52.571
It's his joke file.

28:56.337 --> 28:57.629
Professional jokes?

28:58.913 --> 28:59.913
Field-tested.

29:00.612 --> 29:01.612
Guaranteed.

29:02.015 --> 29:04.467
You want to go back
on theMax Hudson show, right?

29:04.468 --> 29:06.619
Well, here's your chance
to give him a taste

29:06.620 --> 29:09.082
of the medicine that he prescribes.

29:12.078 --> 29:13.881
"For the first year of my marriage,

29:13.882 --> 29:16.234
I thought the only flavor was charcoal."

29:22.119 --> 29:25.000
Yeah, 'cause she was a bad cook.
She burnt everything.

29:26.599 --> 29:27.599
You see?

29:27.834 --> 29:29.001
That's good.

29:31.017 --> 29:33.101
That's... powerful.

29:34.825 --> 29:36.177
Are they all that good?

29:36.328 --> 29:39.328
Well, he performed a lot of them
at my Bar Mitzvah.

29:39.881 --> 29:40.881
And he killed.

29:42.532 --> 29:43.867
Oh, thank you, Kevin.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.201
All right, let's see.

29:49.101 --> 29:51.201
I'll take some "Mother-In-Laws."

29:51.235 --> 29:52.418
Splendid.

29:52.574 --> 29:54.070
Oh, "Hippy jokes."

29:54.370 --> 29:55.605
I bet those are good.

29:55.671 --> 29:56.671
Those are good.

29:57.822 --> 29:59.469
And what are these red ones?

30:00.075 --> 30:01.604
Those are his dirty jokes.

30:01.982 --> 30:04.746
He only used those
when he was in real trouble.

30:09.230 --> 30:11.664
- I'll just take one of those, okay?
- Take it.

30:14.338 --> 30:16.223
I think I'm going to change that
to "B. M."

30:16.224 --> 30:18.047
Yeah, that still-- still works.

30:19.028 --> 30:20.529
Hey, Max, guess who's back.

30:20.530 --> 30:22.118
The psycho wipey detective.

30:22.537 --> 30:24.841
Monk?
Spunky Monkey is here?

30:25.046 --> 30:28.348
I didn't think he had the nerve, the way
he skedaddled outta here last time.

30:28.349 --> 30:29.502
Is the blonde with him?

30:29.503 --> 30:31.191
Natalie, I love you.

30:31.649 --> 30:32.705
That's disgusting.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.505
Hey, well,
let's bring him on inside here.

30:34.565 --> 30:36.858
Let's hear
what's on his so-called mind.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.914
Maybe we should wait for the Captain.

30:40.378 --> 30:41.378
Look.

30:42.430 --> 30:43.430
What are those?

30:43.838 --> 30:46.197
Those are golden bullets.

30:46.214 --> 30:48.203
What are you talking about?
What are those cards?

30:48.236 --> 30:49.787
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.

30:49.928 --> 30:51.061
It's in the bag.

30:51.814 --> 30:53.280
- He's scared.
- Look at the sleeve.

30:53.345 --> 30:54.451
Look at the sleeve.

30:54.452 --> 30:55.452
And the sleeve.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.002
Hi, Max,

30:59.179 --> 31:00.179
J., Willie.

31:00.577 --> 31:03.428
- Did you guys miss me?
- Wipe. Wipe, wipe.

31:05.484 --> 31:07.384
- Look who's back.
- Surprised?

31:07.901 --> 31:11.723
More like annoyed, actually. For those
of you who missed it last week,

31:11.807 --> 31:13.821
Adrian Monk is a private detective

31:13.888 --> 31:15.703
who was hired by my ex-sister-in law

31:15.770 --> 31:17.254
who's delusional

31:17.739 --> 31:20.931
'cause she thinks I killed my...
my wife.

31:21.431 --> 31:24.375
So what can we do for you today,
Mr. Mo-onk?

31:24.500 --> 31:29.624
Well,
for three weeks before Jeanette died,

31:29.909 --> 31:32.956
you left the house
at 2:00 every afternoon.

31:33.011 --> 31:34.972
- Yes.
- According to her sister,

31:35.044 --> 31:37.761
you said you were going to the gym.

31:38.086 --> 31:40.173
- That's right.
- Well, I went to your gym.

31:40.258 --> 31:43.276
And they said that
you haven't been there in six months.

31:43.379 --> 31:48.262
So my first question is:
what were you doing at 2:00 every day?

31:49.687 --> 31:52.037
Well, uh, that's really
none of your business,

31:52.136 --> 31:54.194
but, uh, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

31:54.811 --> 31:58.044
It's no secret Jeanette and I
had an understanding.

31:58.100 --> 32:01.208
We had what some people
would call an "open marriage".

32:01.209 --> 32:03.537
In my house it's called,
"The Impossible Dream."

32:04.208 --> 32:05.535
So you're absolutely right.

32:05.602 --> 32:06.952
I did not go to the gym.

32:07.164 --> 32:09.352
I was getting
a different kind of workout.

32:09.576 --> 32:11.026
Yeah, baby!

32:12.985 --> 32:14.837
And for those of you
keeping score at home,

32:14.838 --> 32:17.090
that's Max one, Monk nothing.

32:17.704 --> 32:18.987
You wanna play?

32:19.287 --> 32:20.404
Okay.

32:21.042 --> 32:22.383
Let's-- Let's play.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.975
Oh... here we go!

32:28.051 --> 32:29.101
You know, Max.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.355
You look like you're out of shape.

32:31.555 --> 32:34.975
When you go to a restaurant,
you don't use a fork.

32:35.773 --> 32:37.373
You use a harpoon.

32:41.326 --> 32:42.326
What?

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
You heard me.

32:43.624 --> 32:45.578
When you took your dog to the dog show,

32:45.579 --> 32:47.912
you won first prize, not your dog.

32:51.523 --> 32:54.011
Yeah, that's, uh... that's not funny.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.184
- Yes, it is.
- No. No, it's not.

32:59.247 --> 33:01.817
Yes, it is.
You know who you remind me of?

33:02.904 --> 33:06.082
The hippie who came home
and gave his dog fleas.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.508
"Hippie?"
What year is this?

33:09.485 --> 33:12.677
Actually, you remind me
of several different hippies.

33:13.468 --> 33:15.522
Like the hippie
who moved into a new apartment

33:15.523 --> 33:19.922
and it was six months before
he realized there was no hot water.

33:24.079 --> 33:26.391
I'm sorry, but you had that coming.

33:26.545 --> 33:27.545
Yeah, um...

33:27.694 --> 33:30.766
Adrian, are you telling jokes, buddy?

33:30.963 --> 33:32.467
Max, you've got a caller.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.420
Thank God.

33:33.421 --> 33:34.833
Hello, Mr. Hudson.

33:35.014 --> 33:36.672
Long-time listener, first-time caller.

33:36.673 --> 33:37.673
I love the show.

33:37.698 --> 33:38.748
Thank you.

33:38.772 --> 33:40.220
I can't believe I got through.

33:40.439 --> 33:46.006
Listen, I just got back from Los Angeles
and the smog was terrible.

33:46.491 --> 33:51.073
I was wondering if anyone there
has any thoughts on the subject.

33:51.595 --> 33:52.912
Max, I'll take this one.

33:53.818 --> 33:55.018
I know what he means.

33:55.709 --> 33:56.997
The smog was so bad,

33:57.305 --> 34:01.388
one time I shot an arrow into the air,
and it stuck.

34:04.974 --> 34:05.974
In the a-- air.

34:11.831 --> 34:13.032
From the smog.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.830
Yeah. Yeah, J., that sound-effect

34:17.844 --> 34:20.138
is about as funny as my wife's cooking.

34:20.393 --> 34:21.951
Do you know what she made every night?

34:21.952 --> 34:22.952
A noose?

34:25.891 --> 34:27.608
No.
No, not a noose.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.725
Leftovers.
Why would she make a noose?

34:29.775 --> 34:31.943
Yeah, seriously, though.
Are-- are you married?

34:32.045 --> 34:35.706
Because that's
a woman I would love to meet.

34:37.838 --> 34:38.955
I was married.

34:39.906 --> 34:41.264
Her name was Trudy.

34:41.366 --> 34:42.366
She died.

34:43.827 --> 34:44.827
She was murdered.

34:46.029 --> 34:47.087
It was a car bomb.

34:50.033 --> 34:51.089
Aw, man, that sucks.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.139
May she rest in peace.

34:52.139 --> 34:53.139
Well...

34:53.183 --> 34:54.183
rest in pieces.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.505
I mean, at least my wife
was buried in a coffin.

34:57.506 --> 34:58.812
What was Trudy buried in,

34:58.813 --> 35:00.303
a bunch of little snack bags?

35:00.898 --> 35:02.059
Let me in there!

35:02.713 --> 35:03.797
Max, take it easy.

35:03.863 --> 35:05.513
Seriously.
You should have called me in.

35:05.565 --> 35:08.841
I could've helped you with the case.
I'm great with jigsaw puzzles.

35:09.674 --> 35:11.618
Are you joking about Trudy?

35:11.753 --> 35:13.953
"Adrian, I'm wanna use the car now.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.731
Go for a drive.
What's this button do?"

35:18.991 --> 35:21.807
I bet you need a whole
buncha wipes that day, huh?

35:22.230 --> 35:24.080
By the way,
you know the last thing that went

35:24.115 --> 35:26.034
through your wife's mind--
the steering wheel.

35:26.134 --> 35:27.167
No, seriously...

35:39.574 --> 35:41.291
Thanks for stopping by, Adrian.

35:41.863 --> 35:42.863
Come by anytime.

35:43.709 --> 35:44.709
Be right back.

35:50.635 --> 35:51.635
Did you hear him?

35:51.714 --> 35:53.248
Did you hear what he said about Trudy?

35:53.249 --> 35:54.954
We were in the car.
We had to pull over.

35:54.970 --> 35:55.986
I couldn't even drive.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.290
That wasn't funny, was it?

35:57.350 --> 35:58.995
No, Mr. Monk.
It was unspeakable.

35:59.035 --> 36:00.095
Here's what I was thinking:

36:00.096 --> 36:02.595
Number one, sounded like
you got a couple good shots in.

36:02.596 --> 36:03.713
I was proud of you.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.688
And two, he sounded scared.

36:06.151 --> 36:08.002
- Scared and guilty.
- He is guilty.

36:08.904 --> 36:10.171
25 years to life.

36:10.270 --> 36:11.692
That's the best revenge.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.212
So let's just take a deep breath.

36:14.823 --> 36:15.923
Let's focus.

36:16.631 --> 36:18.636
And let's figure out how he did this.

36:29.596 --> 36:32.024
Okay, he was on... on the radio.

36:33.501 --> 36:35.853
Doing his show
and the house was locked.

36:36.062 --> 36:38.162
Locked and bolted from the inside.

36:38.410 --> 36:42.121
The little window in the back
was open but only eight inches.

36:42.216 --> 36:44.037
Not big enough for a little person.

36:44.187 --> 36:46.753
which has already
been established scientifically.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.339
Ooh, yeah, you got it!

37:02.034 --> 37:03.368
Ooh, here he comes.

37:03.468 --> 37:04.468
Oh, he's got it.

37:04.502 --> 37:05.816
Is that... a loafer?

37:07.250 --> 37:08.417
Yeah, I think so.

37:09.284 --> 37:11.150
A brown, Ramato loafer,

37:11.268 --> 37:12.618
size 101/2.

37:12.972 --> 37:13.979
How do you know that?

37:13.980 --> 37:15.668
Oh, uh, hello again.

37:16.510 --> 37:17.810
He's not bothering you, is her?

37:17.838 --> 37:19.263
No, no.
Just curious...

37:19.791 --> 37:21.535
Where did he get that shoe?

37:21.699 --> 37:22.699
Oh, hell.

37:22.801 --> 37:24.095
It's not yours, is it?

37:24.550 --> 37:26.050
I am so sorry.

37:26.383 --> 37:28.250
He has a thing for shoes.

37:28.456 --> 37:29.981
I don't know where he got this shoe.

37:30.031 --> 37:33.181
He, just had it
when I got back from our vacation.

37:33.662 --> 37:34.897
You were on vacation?

37:35.055 --> 37:36.715
Hawaii.
We go every July.

37:37.719 --> 37:39.189
Who was watching the dog?

37:40.280 --> 37:42.730
You're notgonna believe it.
I still can't believe it.

37:42.873 --> 37:44.006
Max Hudson.

37:44.376 --> 37:45.897
He just volunteered.

37:46.178 --> 37:49.372
I mean, you think a guy like that
would have better things to do.

38:02.460 --> 38:03.460
What, uh...?

38:05.315 --> 38:06.315
What's going on?

38:06.474 --> 38:10.073
Well, I could tell you, but,
Adrian Monk wants to tell you himself.

38:10.273 --> 38:11.273
He's upstairs.

38:12.392 --> 38:13.475
After you.

38:16.886 --> 38:17.886
Linda.

38:18.394 --> 38:20.847
I don't know the legal definition
of harassment,

38:20.848 --> 38:22.612
but, uh, this is pretty close.

38:22.654 --> 38:24.771
Mr. Hudson, that's a search warrant.

38:25.009 --> 38:26.420
You've been duly served.

38:27.857 --> 38:29.224
Uh, sure, okay.

38:29.260 --> 38:30.377
Knock yourself out.

38:30.718 --> 38:33.012
You'll just embarrass yourselves again.

38:33.317 --> 38:34.317
It's over, Max.

38:34.674 --> 38:35.925
We know how you did it.

38:35.926 --> 38:38.002
We know what you were doing
everyday at 2:00.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.610
- You were next door.
- That's right. I was.

38:40.626 --> 38:41.680
I was house-sitting.

38:41.681 --> 38:43.328
I was watering their plants.

38:43.386 --> 38:45.327
Nah, you were training their dog.

38:45.492 --> 38:49.351
We replayed a tape of the show
you made the morning your wife died.

38:49.352 --> 38:52.469
That was the day you introduced
your new catchphrase:

38:52.809 --> 38:54.297
"Jangle my tenders."

38:54.512 --> 38:55.847
"Jiggle me timbers," sir.

38:56.058 --> 38:57.261
"Jiggle me timbers."

38:57.262 --> 38:58.856
You never said it before that day.

38:59.018 --> 39:00.018
Or since.

39:00.565 --> 39:01.565
I'm a big fan.

39:02.067 --> 39:03.067
Well, I was.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.137
Unless you're not guilty.

39:05.172 --> 39:07.407
In which case, we're all really sorry.

39:07.443 --> 39:10.416
about all of this.
Although, I'm pretty sure you're guilty.

39:10.591 --> 39:12.223
But, if you're not, I'm sorry.

39:12.743 --> 39:14.060
This is insane.

39:14.818 --> 39:16.776
Well, it's easy enough to prove.

39:19.152 --> 39:20.152
Let's do it.

39:21.564 --> 39:23.669
... came out on Friday
I saw it last night.

39:23.670 --> 39:25.249
<i>Jiggle me timbers!</i>

39:29.645 --> 39:31.385
<i>Where do you get that
"Jiggle me timbers?"</i>

39:31.386 --> 39:32.980
<i>You've been saying that all morning.</i>

39:32.981 --> 39:34.269
The new catchphrase.

39:35.135 --> 39:36.342
That was your command.

39:36.343 --> 39:38.995
That dog was your accomplice.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.542
You worked with him
everyday for a month.

39:41.651 --> 39:43.934
You trained him to murder your wife.

39:44.405 --> 39:47.056
That morning, you could have been
a hundred miles away.

39:47.057 --> 39:49.957
You left his cage open and a radio on.

39:50.457 --> 39:53.809
All you had to do was go on the air
and give the command.

39:53.963 --> 39:55.668
You knew Jeanette would be fast asleep.

39:55.669 --> 39:57.374
You knew she'd never wake up.

39:58.370 --> 39:59.732
Oh, here he comes.

40:17.016 --> 40:18.584
You made one big mistake.

40:19.274 --> 40:21.020
Your partner, your accomplice.

40:21.021 --> 40:22.609
He's got a thing for shoes.

40:23.122 --> 40:25.592
He stole one of yours
and brought it home.

40:26.933 --> 40:28.227
So is he under arrest?

40:28.487 --> 40:29.487
Yes, he is.

40:30.186 --> 40:31.362
Thank you, Mr. Monk.

40:31.492 --> 40:32.492
Thank you.

40:33.539 --> 40:34.950
You heard the lady, Max.

40:35.439 --> 40:36.615
You're under arrest.

40:36.892 --> 40:37.892
Gimme your hands.

40:43.158 --> 40:45.196
You're not laughing now.

40:46.611 --> 40:47.611
Are you?

40:49.409 --> 40:50.409
Are you?

40:51.790 --> 40:52.823
No.

40:53.669 --> 40:54.669
I'm not laughing.

40:57.072 --> 40:58.072
Join the club.

40:59.282 --> 41:00.282
Let's go.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.440
<i>Here we go.</i>

41:10.893 --> 41:12.043
<i>That looks good!</i>

41:35.075 --> 41:36.310
<i>I love how you laugh.</i>
