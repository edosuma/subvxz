32:57.486 --> 32:59.521
Could you show us the salt?

32:59.572 --> 33:01.489
- Sure.
- It's in here.

33:09.532 --> 33:12.200
You moron. That's not the salt... this is!

33:12.202 --> 33:14.252
That's the stuff I use
to cure the corned beef

33:14.286 --> 33:15.670
on St. Patrick's Day.

33:17.756 --> 33:18.790
Sodium nitrite.

33:18.841 --> 33:19.924
And you keep it next to the salt?

33:19.959 --> 33:21.176
I'm not the moron, you are.

33:21.210 --> 33:23.261
At least I didn't put it on the popcorn.

33:23.295 --> 33:26.965
Or... in the salt shakers.

33:27.016 --> 33:28.716
Wait, so we've all been eating it?

33:28.767 --> 33:30.351
Which is why you've been showing symptoms...

33:30.386 --> 33:32.353
Fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.

33:32.388 --> 33:33.805
It's nitrite poisoning.

33:33.856 --> 33:35.390
A few hundred milligrams can be toxic,

33:35.392 --> 33:36.975
although not in this case fatal.

33:37.026 --> 33:38.726
So which one of these clowns do I demote

33:38.777 --> 33:40.562
for trying to kill me?

33:40.613 --> 33:42.063
Once you stop ingesting nitrite,

33:42.065 --> 33:43.481
it naturally leaves your body.

33:43.532 --> 33:44.732
You'll be fine.

33:44.783 --> 33:46.985
So I just got the worst of it

33:47.036 --> 33:48.570
because I had the most of it.

33:48.572 --> 33:50.371
- And because you're older.
- Thanks.

33:50.406 --> 33:51.823
- And heavier.
- Thanks again.

33:51.874 --> 33:53.741
You should be in the hospital
until your oxygen level

33:53.792 --> 33:54.742
returns to normal.

33:54.793 --> 33:56.661
I'll call an ambulance.

33:56.712 --> 34:00.415
Or we can use the one downstairs.

34:02.468 --> 34:06.471
[Speaking Arabic]

34:17.483 --> 34:20.935
[Dialing]

34:20.937 --> 34:24.438
Put down the phone, Dr. Lawson.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.574
Oh, uh... Yeah, hey.

34:27.610 --> 34:29.694
I-I was wondering if we
could get a couple burgers,

34:29.745 --> 34:32.447
you know, maybe some nice cold beers.

34:35.167 --> 34:37.368
I like mine rare.

34:37.418 --> 34:40.204
If you can't taste the
blood, what's the point?

34:40.255 --> 34:42.123
Don't you agree, doctor?

34:42.125 --> 34:45.627
Uh, yeah. Yeah, no, I-I
like a nice rare burger.

34:45.678 --> 34:47.128
But you should really
keep your leg elevated.

34:47.179 --> 34:48.795
- I don't want...
- What I don't want

34:48.847 --> 34:49.964
is to wait any longer.

34:50.014 --> 34:51.966
I realize if my health is at risk,

34:51.967 --> 34:54.886
we need to make our deposit
as soon as possible.

34:54.937 --> 34:57.472
- We go to the bank now.
- Okay, but, Berta, you have...

34:57.474 --> 35:00.475
Don't make me cut off the phones, Hank,

35:00.526 --> 35:02.477
or anything else.

35:13.872 --> 35:15.990
Look, it's not that we don't
want to spend time with you.

35:15.992 --> 35:17.625
Obviously, I mean, we really
want to get to know you.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.794
If we didn't, we never would
have offered in the first place.

35:19.828 --> 35:21.412
Yeah, it's just that apparently,

35:21.463 --> 35:23.665
for the sake of our marriage,
we... we shouldn't have.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.166
Sure. I mean, you guys are still

35:25.217 --> 35:26.417
basically newlyweds, right?

35:26.468 --> 35:28.670
- Yes, we're...
- No... what?

35:28.721 --> 35:30.338
- Yes, we are.
- Well, it's not official.

35:30.389 --> 35:31.839
I mean, take your time. Figure it out.

35:31.890 --> 35:35.009
- It's... it's complicated, so...
- Even to us.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.095
Guys, I get it. It's a small place.

35:37.146 --> 35:39.013
The last thing you need is,
like, me in the next room

35:39.064 --> 35:42.684
listening to you... I mean,
not that I would listen to you

35:42.735 --> 35:44.569
- or that you were making...
- Right.

35:44.603 --> 35:46.571
Oh, my gosh. You know what? TMI.

35:46.605 --> 35:48.156
We'll just leave it at "I get it."

35:48.190 --> 35:49.157
Let's leave it at that. That's great.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.158
Yeah, yeah, great.

35:50.192 --> 35:51.159
Thank you for understanding, Emma.

35:51.193 --> 35:52.577
That's awesome.

35:52.611 --> 35:53.945
And, uh, you're gonna love
living here with Hank too.

35:53.996 --> 35:55.079
Yeah, he's super fun.

35:55.114 --> 35:57.198
- Do you like running?
- Well, no, not really.

35:57.249 --> 35:59.834
- Baseball?
- Uh, no.

35:59.868 --> 36:01.703
Any favorite medical journals?

36:01.705 --> 36:03.254
You know, why do we only have to do things

36:03.288 --> 36:04.288
that he wants to do?

36:04.340 --> 36:06.040
Oh, my God. Welcome to my life.

36:06.042 --> 36:07.508
Guys, don't sweat it.

36:07.543 --> 36:09.677
Why would I whine about
living in a place like this

36:09.712 --> 36:12.213
with, you know, my second favorite brother?

36:12.264 --> 36:13.214
- Aw.
- Nice.

36:13.265 --> 36:14.349
Yeah. [Alarm beeping]

36:14.383 --> 36:15.633
Oh, I got to put Sashi down.

36:15.684 --> 36:17.218
I promised Divya I'd get her to bed on time.

36:17.269 --> 36:21.105
Oh, do you have, um, you know...

36:21.140 --> 36:24.058
Uh, already? Yeah, sure, what do you need?

36:24.109 --> 36:26.978
No, no, no, a key, 'cause I live here now.

36:27.029 --> 36:28.529
- Of course, a key.
- Yeah.

36:28.564 --> 36:31.366
Sorry, I don't know what... Here you go.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.900
Thank you.

36:32.951 --> 36:34.318
You guys can just let yourselves out, right?

36:34.370 --> 36:35.953
- Ah.
- Great.

36:35.988 --> 36:36.988
- Cool.
- Bye.

36:37.039 --> 36:39.157
Bye.

36:39.208 --> 36:41.909
Well, that's... That went pretty well...

36:41.911 --> 36:43.628
- Yeah.
- Up to a point.

36:43.662 --> 36:44.996
The point where you assumed
she wanted more money?

36:45.047 --> 36:47.081
- Yeah, that point.
- Hey, we should tell Bob.

36:47.132 --> 36:49.550
- I was just thinking that.
- Unless it'd seem needy.

36:49.585 --> 36:50.752
We have a session tomorrow.
We'll just tell him then.

36:50.803 --> 36:52.003
Although we could stop by...

36:52.054 --> 36:53.087
To see if he's had any more power outages.

36:53.089 --> 36:54.505
- Perfect.
- High five.

36:54.556 --> 36:56.174
[Laughs]

37:03.432 --> 37:05.850
Hennrick? Yousef?

37:05.852 --> 37:07.852
[Tires screech] Get back inside.

37:07.903 --> 37:10.238
Stop! Don't move!

37:10.272 --> 37:12.240
You are under arrest
for terrorist financing,

37:12.274 --> 37:13.274
money laundering.

37:13.276 --> 37:14.742
- Put your hands up.
- Okay, okay.

37:14.777 --> 37:16.411
It's not my money. It's his.

37:16.445 --> 37:18.162
No, not.

37:18.197 --> 37:20.281
Look, I'm a sick woman. I have an embolism.

37:20.283 --> 37:23.084
It could kill me. He'll
tell you, he's my doctor.

37:23.118 --> 37:26.003
Actually, he's my doctor,
when he's available.

37:26.038 --> 37:27.755
It's good to see you're still alive, Hank.

37:27.790 --> 37:30.258
How the... have you been
following us the whole time?

37:30.292 --> 37:32.427
- Mostly.
- Would have been nice to know.

37:32.461 --> 37:34.762
How bad is her embolism?

37:34.797 --> 37:38.049
She doesn't have one.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.050
I was just trying to stall in the hope

37:39.101 --> 37:40.301
that I could find a way out of this.

37:40.303 --> 37:42.937
You showed it to me on the ultrasound.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.388
I saw the blockage myself.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.692
That wasn't a blockage.
That was my cuff link.

37:47.726 --> 37:50.278
- Technically my cuff link.
- True.

37:50.312 --> 37:52.113
The pain in my legs and my feet?

37:52.147 --> 37:54.282
Is from gout. It's not life threatening,

37:54.316 --> 37:56.067
but you should try to
avoid eating rich foods,

37:56.118 --> 37:58.152
red wine, oysters... that kind of thing.

37:58.154 --> 38:00.404
Yeah, where she's going,
that won't be a problem.

38:00.456 --> 38:02.490
You're a traitor. We had a deal.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.710
We did. But like you said...

38:05.744 --> 38:08.246
"Trust is for the birds."

38:08.297 --> 38:12.083
[Chuckles]

38:12.134 --> 38:14.969
Oh, here you go.

38:15.003 --> 38:17.472
Keep them.

38:17.506 --> 38:18.973
Hmm.

38:29.177 --> 38:32.379
Mm. Well... chief's breathing easy.

38:32.430 --> 38:33.931
Guys are super grateful.

38:33.965 --> 38:36.383
And how is everyone feeling,
now that you're nitrite free?

38:36.385 --> 38:38.385
Well, turns out nitrite

38:38.436 --> 38:39.803
was the tastiest part of Tommy's cooking.

38:39.854 --> 38:41.355
[Laughing] Right.

38:41.389 --> 38:44.391
[Both chuckle]

38:44.393 --> 38:47.394
So maybe we should get
some food with that drink.

38:47.396 --> 38:50.197
What drink? Oh, right.

38:50.231 --> 38:51.865
The one we'll never have.

38:51.899 --> 38:54.401
Well, I'm free now, if you are,

38:54.403 --> 38:56.370
and I haven't had any dinner.

38:56.404 --> 38:59.239
- Seriously?
- [Laughs]

38:59.290 --> 39:02.292
After you.

39:04.379 --> 39:08.632
[Shouting in Spanish]

39:08.666 --> 39:12.753
No! [Shouting in Spanish]

39:12.804 --> 39:14.588
Goal!

39:14.590 --> 39:16.974
<i>Si!</i> [Continues in Spanish]

39:17.008 --> 39:20.427
[Crowd noise on TV, Viviana murmurs]

39:22.347 --> 39:23.480
[TV shuts off]

39:25.767 --> 39:27.267
Wow. Look at you.

39:27.318 --> 39:29.486
Yeah. I've been working out.

39:29.520 --> 39:33.273
So a turkey club today or a cheeseburger?

39:33.324 --> 39:36.777
Because I can't decide what you feel like.

39:36.779 --> 39:39.863
If you do CP...R, it takes my breath away.

39:41.032 --> 39:42.916
What?

39:42.950 --> 39:46.336
- Cheeseburger.
- Cheeseburger.

39:52.343 --> 39:54.961
[Sighs]

40:00.635 --> 40:02.219
I encouraged her to overindulge,

40:02.270 --> 40:05.055
hoping the attacks of
gout would slow her down.

40:05.106 --> 40:06.807
You were wise to make yourself so useful.

40:06.858 --> 40:09.309
I figured sedation crossed
the hippocratic line,

40:09.360 --> 40:11.061
so I'm glad you appeared when you did.

40:11.112 --> 40:13.146
Once again, I've dragged
you into a gray area

40:13.148 --> 40:14.981
where you don't belong.

40:14.983 --> 40:18.285
Not too shabby, this gray area.

40:18.319 --> 40:19.486
So how'd you track me?

40:19.488 --> 40:21.621
GPS in the cufflinks?

40:21.656 --> 40:23.623
Don't be silly, Hank.

40:23.658 --> 40:26.076
It's easier to hide money than people.

40:26.127 --> 40:28.412
Oh, this is yours.

40:28.463 --> 40:31.164
I hope you haven't missed too
many important phone calls.

40:31.215 --> 40:32.666
None, actually.

40:32.668 --> 40:35.302
They seem to be getting
along just fine without me.

40:35.336 --> 40:39.172
My plane will be at your
disposal within the hour.

40:39.174 --> 40:42.592
Boris, you don't seem too
pleased with this mission.

40:42.643 --> 40:45.262
Is this where you tell me
there's more work to be done?

40:45.313 --> 40:48.732
Oh, don't worry, Hank.
I won't enlist you again.

40:48.766 --> 40:51.651
I've asked too much of you already.

40:51.686 --> 40:54.688
Boris, I am more than
grateful for all the ways

40:54.690 --> 40:56.690
you've changed my life,

40:56.692 --> 40:59.025
not the least of which is
making Hankmed possible,

40:59.027 --> 41:01.862
and to be honest, I've enjoyed
helping you in your work.

41:01.864 --> 41:04.614
Minus the kidnapping and the handcuffs.

41:04.665 --> 41:06.416
Getting drugged and shoved
in the back of a limo

41:06.451 --> 41:09.619
- in Budapest was...
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.

41:09.670 --> 41:13.590
You force me out of my comfort zone,

41:13.624 --> 41:16.593
and that's been good for me.

41:16.627 --> 41:18.128
But I have been exploiting you, Hank,

41:18.179 --> 41:21.381
allowing your moral compass
to guide me these last years.

41:21.432 --> 41:22.632
That's why I was so unhappy

41:22.683 --> 41:25.385
with your decision to stay in the Hamptons.

41:25.436 --> 41:27.554
I thought I needed to simplify my life,

41:27.556 --> 41:31.024
but this life isn't simple, is it?

41:31.058 --> 41:32.359
One doesn't have just one enemy

41:32.393 --> 41:35.562
or one stalwart friend.

41:35.613 --> 41:36.980
And purging my bank

41:37.031 --> 41:40.200
of one particularly odious apple

41:40.234 --> 41:41.401
isn't enough.

41:41.452 --> 41:43.236
My family's business has always been murky,

41:43.287 --> 41:44.321
to say the least.

41:44.372 --> 41:47.124
I want to leave my son

41:47.158 --> 41:50.043
a different legacy.

41:50.077 --> 41:52.913
And what legacy is that?

41:52.915 --> 41:56.133
I don't know.

41:56.167 --> 41:59.085
I know only that I must
summon the courage to find it

41:59.137 --> 42:03.590
and find my own compass.

42:03.641 --> 42:06.593
But where do I start?

42:06.595 --> 42:10.263
Looks like you've already started.
