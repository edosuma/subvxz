52:01.160 --> 52:02.821
Get them out of here! Close the doors!

52:03.037 --> 52:04.402
This is no concern to you! Get out!

52:04.955 --> 52:05.945
Let me through!

52:06.123 --> 52:08.034
I'm a healer!
Let me through!

52:28.812 --> 52:30.018
Make way!

52:30.606 --> 52:32.517
I am the Harbor Master! Make way!

52:51.001 --> 52:52.082
It's the pox.

52:54.421 --> 52:55.456
It is smallpox.

52:55.839 --> 52:57.750
Shut up, you stupid fool of a woman!
Do you want to ruin me?

52:57.841 --> 53:00.378
I should prefer ye speak to my wife
with more respect, Monsieur!

53:15.234 --> 53:16.520
He's already dead.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.410
This woman is telling the truth!

53:34.628 --> 53:35.834
It is indeed smallpox.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.003
Everyone must leave! Now!

53:38.424 --> 53:40.415
In the name of The King, I order you out!

53:42.219 --> 53:44.551
This can still be handled quietly.

53:44.638 --> 53:46.595
I am sorry...
It is too late for that.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.807
We must set up a quarantine
immediately if we are to --

53:49.893 --> 53:51.054
- Stop!
- Watch it!

54:07.286 --> 54:08.742
We can take the men to a quiet place.

54:09.538 --> 54:11.575
I have rooms in town where
no one need ever--

54:11.707 --> 54:12.742
I am sorry...

54:13.375 --> 54:15.207
...but the news will be all over
the docks by now.

54:16.462 --> 54:17.497
The law is clear...

54:17.838 --> 54:18.999
...and I have no choice.

54:19.757 --> 54:21.293
I must arrange for the
destruction of your ship...

54:21.383 --> 54:22.714
...and your cargo.

54:43.697 --> 54:44.732
Who the hell are you?

54:48.619 --> 54:50.075
My name is Claire Fraser.

54:51.663 --> 54:52.824
I am a healer.

54:53.499 --> 54:55.115
English. I should have known.

54:56.210 --> 54:58.622
Only an English woman would
be so ill-bred and vulgar.

54:58.962 --> 55:00.327
You will watch your tongue, Monsieur.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.880
This is my wife...

55:04.218 --> 55:05.504
...Lady Broch Tuarach.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.301
"Lord" and "Lady."

55:09.515 --> 55:11.472
The English give out titles of nobility...

55:11.558 --> 55:13.390
...like pearls before swine.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.804
Squabbling in this place
is beneath our dignity.

55:18.315 --> 55:19.805
Who are these people, Fraser?

55:20.984 --> 55:22.566
Is this some scheme of yours?

55:25.364 --> 55:26.399
...is my cousin...

55:27.115 --> 55:30.324
...and I can assure you our presence here...

55:31.036 --> 55:32.652
...is entirely by chance.

55:32.955 --> 55:34.741
Have you any idea what you have done?

55:35.624 --> 55:36.659
Do you?

55:43.841 --> 55:45.548
These men had smallpox.

55:46.885 --> 55:50.173
My entire cargo and my ship --
will be destroyed.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.171
The cost.

55:52.683 --> 55:54.640
The cost is nothing compared
to letting the disease...

55:54.726 --> 55:55.841
...spread through the city.

56:00.858 --> 56:01.939
You will pay a price.

56:03.694 --> 56:04.855
You will both pay...
