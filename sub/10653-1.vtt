01:17.159 --> 01:21.496
Lord Jesus Christ,
you said unto your apostles,

01:21.621 --> 01:26.709
<i>"I leave you in peace.
My peace I give to you."</i>

01:26.834 --> 01:32.214
<i>Look not upon your sins
but on the faith of your church,</i>

01:32.339 --> 01:35.175
<i>and grant us the peace and unity
of your kingdom,</i>

01:35.300 --> 01:38.386
<i>where you live forever and ever.</i>

01:39.970 --> 01:45.183
<i>- The peace of the Lord be with you always.
- And also with you.</i>

01:47.059 --> 01:51.897
<i>This is the Lamb of God
who takes away the sins of the world.</i>

01:52.731 --> 01:55.650
Happy are they
who are called to his supper.

02:00.404 --> 02:01.488
Hello, Jacob.

02:02.989 --> 02:03.990
Father.

02:06.117 --> 02:07.368
Thank you for coming.

02:07.493 --> 02:11.872
Hey, I haven't seen you in church
just recently. How are you?

02:14.290 --> 02:16.625
Not good, Father. Not good.

02:16.750 --> 02:21.045
Hm. You're very pale. Are you ill?

02:22.337 --> 02:24.088
I'm not the one who's sick, Father.

02:29.593 --> 02:30.635
<i>It's Anna.</i>

08:11.767 --> 08:15.645
<i>Richard, is there something troubling you?</i>

08:19.690 --> 08:24.611
No, no. I'm prepared for the next trip.

08:24.736 --> 08:25.737
Very well.

08:27.739 --> 08:30.992
You're leaving tomorrow. That will be all.

09:05.440 --> 09:09.986
- Oh, Richard, Richard.
- Ah, wonderful to see you, Theo.

09:10.111 --> 09:12.655
And you. Come, sit down.

09:12.780 --> 09:15.949
- It's been a while.
- Mm, yes, it has.

09:16.074 --> 09:17.283
I see you've started early.

09:17.408 --> 09:22.579
Oh, well... my faith is strong,
my will is weak.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.833
So, what's the background to the case?

09:29.000 --> 09:34.755
A woman, Anna Ecklund,
she has been exorcised previously.

09:37.132 --> 09:38.758
- Really?
- Yes.

09:38.883 --> 09:42.887
That's why I contacted the Vatican
to ask for your assistance.

09:44.346 --> 09:48.558
You see, it's said that...
when the demon returns,

09:48.683 --> 09:51.477
its strength is seven-fold.

09:51.602 --> 09:54.354
Were you involved in the first exorcism?

09:55.813 --> 10:00.692
Oh, yes. I... I've known Anna
since she was a child.

10:00.817 --> 10:05.738
She came
from a good church-going family.

10:05.863 --> 10:09.449
But, at age 14, she showed
symptoms of possession.

10:10.616 --> 10:13.910
- The symptoms have returned.
- How old is she now?

10:15.536 --> 10:17.162
Twenty-five.

10:23.835 --> 10:25.336
Something on your mind?

10:27.504 --> 10:30.757
Perhaps we should
just discuss business, Theo. I...

10:30.882 --> 10:33.801
I don't want to burden you
with my personal issues.

10:34.676 --> 10:38.471
Don't be silly.

10:41.056 --> 10:42.057
Richard, it's me.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.283
I think I've lost my faith.

11:06.330 --> 11:11.293
I think all priests have doubts
at... at some point.

11:13.211 --> 11:16.464
I was in Ireland recently
on an assignment...

11:16.589 --> 11:18.132
and the locals, that day...

11:21.093 --> 11:25.097
they responded so positively
to a statue weeping tears of blood.

11:28.225 --> 11:29.976
And all I wanted to do...

11:31.310 --> 11:33.729
I just wanted to be one
of those people, you know.

11:35.856 --> 11:38.483
Floating on that cloud of absolute faith.

11:40.526 --> 11:42.569
But instead, I just barged
my way through the crowd,

11:42.694 --> 11:45.863
determined to prove
that the statue was not divine.

11:47.322 --> 11:53.661
But you're an investigator. It's your duty
to consider all possibilities.

11:55.162 --> 11:56.913
What I saw, Theo...

12:03.252 --> 12:04.836
Those tears were real.

12:06.212 --> 12:07.504
Aw...

12:08.671 --> 12:11.465
Doesn't that reinforce your faith?

12:12.466 --> 12:17.345
No. It just... It just brought it all
back home to me. I...

12:21.849 --> 12:23.851
I've strayed from God.

12:30.732 --> 12:31.941
Do you, uh...

12:34.068 --> 12:36.445
Do you want to take this case or not?

12:39.614 --> 12:40.990
I'm too weak.

12:45.827 --> 12:49.330
You're much stronger
than you think you are.

12:50.664 --> 12:52.499
I have to be honest, Richard.

12:54.042 --> 12:57.170
Knowing what you're gonna have
to face while you're here...

12:58.796 --> 13:02.257
you're gonna need all the strength
that you can muster.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.138
Why did you bring her to a convent?

13:09.263 --> 13:12.391
What better place to fight evil
than in a house of God?

13:14.726 --> 13:15.977
When Anna first arrived,

13:16.102 --> 13:18.604
we would bring her food
that had been blessed,

13:18.729 --> 13:22.107
and she would react very violently.

13:22.232 --> 13:25.276
When we stopped blessing
the food, she ate it.

13:25.401 --> 13:29.238
I see. Is there any way Anna
could have known of this practice?

13:29.363 --> 13:31.656
We never did it in front of her.

13:31.781 --> 13:34.617
There's no way she'd have known
the food had been blessed.

13:34.742 --> 13:36.201
But it's a fairly safe assumption,

13:36.326 --> 13:39.203
given where we are,
don't you think, Theo?

13:39.328 --> 13:40.537
Perhaps.

14:09.732 --> 14:10.983
Here we are.

14:13.235 --> 14:16.071
Do you mind if I speak with her alone?

14:16.196 --> 14:21.326
Well, uh... of course.
We'll wait out here.

14:22.869 --> 14:23.870
Thank you.

15:14.749 --> 15:18.878
- Anna?
- The slut is in here with us.

15:22.089 --> 15:26.968
- "Us"?
- Yes. For we are many.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.596
Have you been reading the Bible, Anna?

15:32.597 --> 15:34.682
Perhaps you should read your bible.

15:36.558 --> 15:37.600
Really?

15:39.268 --> 15:40.769
Why is that?

15:51.862 --> 15:55.365
- You speak Latin?
- I speak for many.

16:03.079 --> 16:05.247
Satan is now among us.

16:10.585 --> 16:11.627
Repeat that.

16:14.212 --> 16:16.797
Temptation can always be repeated.

16:19.132 --> 16:21.342
Are you seeking to tempt me?

16:21.467 --> 16:27.097
I don't need to tempt you.
You've already tasted the forbidden fruit.

16:29.682 --> 16:31.266
How so?

16:31.391 --> 16:34.268
You sold your soul
to the hypocrites at the Vatican.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.539
Now, you've turned your back
on the Nazarene.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.625
Our time is now.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.463
- Time for what, Anna?
- For you to join us.

16:49.674 --> 16:56.472
- Who is "us"?
- We are Legion.

16:56.597 --> 16:57.848
Now, join us,

16:57.973 --> 17:02.018
and together, we can
overthrow His will and rule.

17:04.103 --> 17:09.900
If you're so powerful...
why are you locked in here?

17:10.025 --> 17:14.237
Why not just overpower everyone
and leave, eh?

17:14.362 --> 17:17.156
We've spent centuries
allowing humanity to believe

17:17.281 --> 17:19.156
they've got the better of us.

17:19.281 --> 17:23.243
But we always rise up
when they least expect it.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.001
- I see.
- You see nothing.

17:31.793 --> 17:36.380
All you do is think of yourself,
you selfish slime!

17:37.255 --> 17:41.342
You have no love for God!
You don't care for His people!

17:41.467 --> 17:46.388
You can never challenge us
when you are so godless!

17:49.099 --> 17:52.977
Now, don't waste any more of my time,
you faithless cocksucker!

18:19.540 --> 18:22.918
Many of the nuns have reported
verbal assaults.

18:23.752 --> 18:28.006
Anna seems to know
personal things about them.

18:28.131 --> 18:31.592
These demons will try
to drive the faithful out

18:31.717 --> 18:34.970
by bringing up personal incidents
about people's pasts...

18:36.096 --> 18:40.433
and recounting personal tragedies
with perverse delight.

18:41.684 --> 18:46.355
Have you had any experience
with people allegedly possessed?

18:46.480 --> 18:48.732
No, but with Anna,

18:48.857 --> 18:54.070
I have no doubt she has been taken over
by a diabolical entity.

18:54.195 --> 18:57.573
- Did you know Anna before she came here?
- I didn't.

18:57.698 --> 19:02.160
But Father Reisinger tells me
she was a God-fearing woman.

19:03.786 --> 19:09.249
Then should an exorcism be approved,
you'd allow it to take place here?

19:10.625 --> 19:13.461
To be honest, I'm frightened by the idea.

19:14.420 --> 19:18.632
I believe the devil will do his uttermost
to seek revenge on us

19:18.757 --> 19:22.051
should Anna be relieved
of her terrible oppression.

19:23.218 --> 19:28.806
But I also believe
God's protecting hand will not fail us.

19:31.725 --> 19:34.227
I have given my consent.

19:35.269 --> 19:37.354
I will not withdraw it.

21:32.379 --> 21:33.379
Father.

21:34.797 --> 21:35.798
Thank you.

21:38.467 --> 21:41.219
- Your wife, Anna...
- Yeah?

21:41.344 --> 21:44.972
Has she been assessed
by a medical team, Jacob?

21:45.097 --> 21:48.141
Yeah.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.018
And?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.980
They can find nothing
physically wrong with her.

21:59.566 --> 22:02.235
Has your wife seen a psychiatrist yet?

22:02.902 --> 22:04.361
Yeah.

22:06.571 --> 22:08.781
They want to hold her for observation.

22:09.948 --> 22:11.950
But I know what that really means, Father.

22:13.117 --> 22:15.619
It means that they want
to have her committed.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.998
And what do you think about that?

22:22.916 --> 22:25.418
Well, there has
to be more to it than that.

22:25.543 --> 22:30.297
I mean, this wasn't a gradual thing.
It came over her so, so suddenly.

22:44.019 --> 22:46.646
Did your wife speak
any foreign languages, Jacob?

22:48.606 --> 22:51.025
- No.
- She doesn't speak Latin?

22:51.150 --> 22:54.153
- No, why?
- I just need to ask.

23:07.166 --> 23:08.375
Tell me about Anna.

23:08.500 --> 23:14.547
Not about her illness.
About her as a person, you know?

23:16.549 --> 23:17.841
Where do I start?

23:21.094 --> 23:26.891
You know, Anna is the most selfless
and caring person I've ever met.

23:28.475 --> 23:33.313
She has this incredible smile.
It's really something.

23:33.438 --> 23:37.066
I could be having...
I could be having the worst day,

23:37.191 --> 23:39.318
all doom and gloom,

23:39.443 --> 23:44.239
but one smile from her and...
it's like the sun comes out.

23:50.912 --> 23:51.913
You see, Father...

23:53.664 --> 23:56.750
my life doesn't make any sense
unless she's in it.

23:56.875 --> 23:58.877
Do you understand?

23:59.002 --> 24:03.756
So, please, please bring her
back to me, Father.

24:08.427 --> 24:09.803
I'm gonna try, Jacob.

26:23.143 --> 26:24.144
Anna.

26:25.895 --> 26:28.856
Anna, did you do this to yourself?

26:31.525 --> 26:36.196
Anna, did you do this to yourself?

26:40.742 --> 26:44.662
Anna, talk to me.
Did you do this to yourself?

26:58.049 --> 27:00.384
<i>The devil is here!</i>

27:37.708 --> 27:38.792
Let me try.

27:46.549 --> 27:50.302
Please, we just want to help you.

27:50.427 --> 27:52.595
No one can help you now.

28:09.691 --> 28:11.734
What on earth is going on?

28:18.531 --> 28:20.449
Let me try. Help me, come on.

29:35.976 --> 29:37.435
What?

29:41.688 --> 29:43.147
What language is this?

29:44.857 --> 29:45.899
It's Latin.

29:50.111 --> 29:51.821
Do you understand what she's saying?

29:53.697 --> 29:54.739
Yes.

29:55.781 --> 29:57.449
What did she say?

29:58.324 --> 30:01.118
The first was, "Fear the priest."

30:02.369 --> 30:03.828
And the second?

30:06.956 --> 30:08.892
She said, "Let the bitch die."

30:41.631 --> 30:44.050
<i>- You're destroying my garden.
- I'm not.</i>

30:44.175 --> 30:45.777
<i>- You are destroying my garden.
- I'm not.</i>

30:45.801 --> 30:47.695
<i>You're bringing all of my flowers
into the house.</i>

30:47.719 --> 30:49.988
<i>- They make it look beautiful.
- They make the house look beautiful.</i>

30:50.012 --> 30:52.281
<i>- They make the garden look...
- Are you filming us? Stop filming.</i>

30:52.305 --> 30:54.408
<i>Come on, man.
Stop following us around with your camera.</i>

30:54.432 --> 30:57.184
<i>Look, this... this is a message
to any future children.</i>

30:57.309 --> 30:59.144
<i>We used to have a garden of flowers.</i>

30:59.269 --> 31:00.311
<i>We did not, no.</i>

31:00.436 --> 31:02.980
<i>It's beautiful out here.
It's beautiful inside.</i>

31:03.105 --> 31:04.564
<i>- Come on.
- I'm going inside.</i>

31:06.816 --> 31:08.818
<i>Stop filming me.</i>

31:17.785 --> 31:19.578
<i>Can I have a beautiful moment
in our garden?</i>

31:19.703 --> 31:21.388
<i>- And you just...
- A beautiful moment right here.</i>

31:21.412 --> 31:23.097
<i>- You're just ruining it, man.
- No, you're not.</i>

31:23.121 --> 31:25.321
<i>- You're ruining it.
- John, do you want to be involved?</i>

31:25.373 --> 31:26.973
<i>Do you want to come
and hang out with us?</i>

31:27.041 --> 31:29.126
<i>You want to come into us? Come on.</i>

31:31.252 --> 31:32.795
<i>I'm serious.</i>

31:36.715 --> 31:39.092
<i>Come on, John, you know
you want to be part of this.</i>

31:43.346 --> 31:44.638
<i>Are you hungry? Are you...</i>

32:42.028 --> 32:43.612
- Laura.
- Yes.

32:43.737 --> 32:46.114
- I'm Father...
- I know who you are.

32:46.239 --> 32:49.533
My aunt said it's probably best
if I don't speak with you.

32:54.454 --> 32:56.456
You know I've come
to talk about Anna, then.

32:57.290 --> 32:58.791
Yes, I know.

33:01.627 --> 33:02.669
Look...

33:05.588 --> 33:07.508
You do realize
that they're not gonna hospitalize

33:07.631 --> 33:08.951
your friend this time, don't you?

33:10.967 --> 33:14.595
I'm just...
I'm just looking for options here.

33:15.304 --> 33:18.682
She's <i>my </i> best friend, okay?
I want what's best for her.

33:18.807 --> 33:23.269
They're gonna lock her away
in an asylum, Laura.

33:24.395 --> 33:28.232
- Do you want that for your best friend?
- No, I don't want that.

33:28.357 --> 33:30.984
I want her to get better.
I miss her a lot.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.485
I know.

33:36.655 --> 33:39.908
Just a few questions
and I'll be on my way, okay?

33:41.576 --> 33:42.618
Okay.

33:51.877 --> 33:53.461
Is there anything that's...

33:55.421 --> 33:58.549
that's happened to Anna
during the times that you spent with her?

34:00.342 --> 34:01.968
You know, maybe it seems...

34:03.344 --> 34:04.511
unusual?

34:05.970 --> 34:07.596
What do you mean by "unusual"?

34:08.722 --> 34:11.725
I don't know.
Anything that seemed strange or maybe...

34:13.184 --> 34:14.226
different.

34:18.103 --> 34:21.982
Look, I just don't think I should be
talking to you about this, okay?

34:24.275 --> 34:25.275
Okay.

34:31.657 --> 34:32.824
Wait!

34:36.702 --> 34:39.746
Okay, there's one thing.

34:41.038 --> 34:45.917
Um, it was a few years ago,
but I bought this pet rabbit, right?

34:46.042 --> 34:51.047
And I invited Anna and a few friends over
to come play with it, and...

34:51.172 --> 34:54.175
It was so little.
It was always trembling all the time.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.927
I thought there was something wrong
with it or something, and...

34:59.721 --> 35:02.598
When Anna touched it, she picked it up,

35:02.723 --> 35:05.100
it would immediately stop trembling.

35:07.060 --> 35:11.022
Its eyes would just glaze over
like it was so content and happy.

35:11.856 --> 35:13.941
And I remember her
putting it back in its box,

35:14.066 --> 35:20.155
and it just laid out like it was
tanning itself on a beach, and...

35:20.280 --> 35:23.783
It didn't do that with anyone.
I mean, it was so responsive to her touch.

35:27.328 --> 35:29.330
Any other experiences like that?

35:33.876 --> 35:35.002
Okay, well...

35:36.211 --> 35:37.795
After that incident with the rabbit,

35:37.920 --> 35:40.923
I got it in my head that she had
these powers from her hands,

35:41.048 --> 35:43.175
like she had this healing energy.

35:44.634 --> 35:47.803
She thought it was ridiculous,
of course, but...

35:47.928 --> 35:49.971
my mom was always in all this pain.

35:50.096 --> 35:52.932
She had developed
this S curve in her spine.

35:53.057 --> 35:55.100
She was always miserable from it, and...

35:55.892 --> 35:57.810
I was begging Anna to try to help her,

35:57.935 --> 36:00.687
but, of course, she said no
and laughed at me.

36:00.812 --> 36:02.396
She didn't think she could help.

36:03.939 --> 36:07.025
But I was relentless,
and finally, she gave in.

36:09.610 --> 36:10.611
And...

36:10.736 --> 36:14.030
I shouldn't be telling you this.

36:17.533 --> 36:20.619
Father, as soon
as she touched my mom's spine...

36:22.495 --> 36:25.164
and neck and hips...

36:25.289 --> 36:27.749
her spine just straightened out.

36:27.874 --> 36:31.419
I mean, over the course of 15 minutes.

36:31.544 --> 36:35.172
I was the only one there, and I just saw
the whole thing happen. I mean...

36:37.507 --> 36:42.261
My jaw dropped. My mom wasn't
in any pain anymore after that.

36:42.386 --> 36:45.222
It was absolutely incredible.

36:45.347 --> 36:47.599
- Did you share that with anyone?
- No.

36:47.724 --> 36:49.642
Anna begged us not to tell anyone.

36:49.767 --> 36:52.603
I mean, I think she was scared
of this gift that she had, and...

36:54.646 --> 36:58.941
She's a religious girl, okay?
She goes to church every week, and...

36:59.066 --> 37:02.861
she didn't want people to think she was
some sort of charlatan or something.

37:50.029 --> 37:52.573
<i>The subject Anna Ecklund has received</i>

37:52.698 --> 37:55.992
<i>both a medical
and psychiatric consultation.</i>

37:56.117 --> 38:00.830
<i>And neither consultation
reached a definitive diagnosis.</i>

38:00.955 --> 38:04.333
<i>Based on the criteria set forth
by the Catholic Church,</i>

38:04.458 --> 38:08.420
<i>it can be determined
that Anna exhibits at least 12 symptoms</i>

38:08.545 --> 38:11.965
<i>associated with demonic possession.</i>

38:12.090 --> 38:15.301
<i>These include cutting, scratching,
and biting of skin,</i>

38:15.426 --> 38:19.346
<i>an intense coldness
in the room she inhabits,</i>

38:19.471 --> 38:23.850
<i>unnatural body postures,
and a change in her physical appearance.</i>

38:25.101 --> 38:27.186
<i>According to those who know her,</i>

38:27.311 --> 38:31.857
<i>she has undergone
a complete personality change.</i>

38:31.982 --> 38:36.361
<i>Her voice also displays
signs of significant change.</i>

38:37.612 --> 38:41.324
<i>She speaks in languages
she has never known or studied.</i>

38:41.449 --> 38:44.326
<i>Anna also exhibits
unnatural physical strength</i>

38:44.451 --> 38:48.830
<i>and appears to have intimate knowledge
of those around her.</i>

38:50.206 --> 38:55.211
<i>She also has violent reactions
to all religious symbols.</i>

39:10.224 --> 39:12.726
The archbishop has given his approval.

39:16.438 --> 39:17.814
Richard?

39:21.442 --> 39:22.818
I have doubts.

39:25.195 --> 39:29.699
There is evidence enough for an exorcism.
The archbishop has said so himself.

39:32.118 --> 39:33.786
I'm doubting myself, Theo.

39:42.711 --> 39:45.714
God never gives us more
than we can handle.

39:49.050 --> 39:51.761
Yeah, but it becomes difficult
to trust God's judgment

39:51.886 --> 39:53.971
in a world that's full
of good people who suffer.

39:54.096 --> 39:55.931
Don't you think?

39:57.432 --> 40:00.059
The world is full of suffering.

40:01.435 --> 40:03.520
One cannot deny that.

40:04.729 --> 40:09.942
But it's also full of people who...
who have overcome.

40:11.068 --> 40:14.780
Most of the world's great achievements
have succeeded

40:14.905 --> 40:18.700
because people keep on trying,

40:18.825 --> 40:22.662
against all the odds, when there's...
When there's no hope left.

40:25.206 --> 40:27.458
That's what the world
is really about, you see?

40:28.750 --> 40:32.920
You keep soldering on,
through adversity.

40:36.590 --> 40:39.968
The most beautiful thing
in the world is hope.

40:42.719 --> 40:45.680
Knowing that yesterday was bad, but...

40:47.431 --> 40:51.393
but hoping that...
tomorrow will be better.

40:52.769 --> 40:57.356
I know the world
is a dangerous place to live, but...

40:57.582 --> 41:01.627
it isn't dangerous because
of the people that... that are evil.

41:03.295 --> 41:07.340
It's because of the people
who will not do anything about the evil.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.471
Be with me at that battle, Richard.

41:15.513 --> 41:19.141
All you will need
to bring with you is hope.

41:21.643 --> 41:25.855
On this journey, you will find yourself.

41:28.983 --> 41:30.442
Theo...

41:31.526 --> 41:32.860
You know, this world...

41:34.236 --> 41:36.571
with all its war, famine...

41:37.822 --> 41:38.823
hate...

41:42.910 --> 41:44.953
Do we really make a difference here?

41:45.078 --> 41:47.663
Do we really make a difference?

41:49.039 --> 41:50.498
The church...

41:52.249 --> 41:53.875
The church is a beacon.

41:57.587 --> 41:58.588
You...

42:00.590 --> 42:05.636
You are a shining beacon for people.

42:29.242 --> 42:33.788
I apologize for the lateness of the hour,
but there's something you must see.

42:58.687 --> 43:00.814
She's sedated.

43:23.837 --> 43:25.338
We must begin soon.

43:26.464 --> 43:28.090
Time is running out.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.943
I know it's been a while.

43:50.945 --> 43:52.488
I'm sorry about that.

43:56.783 --> 43:58.701
I've strayed from the path.

44:02.663 --> 44:05.248
But I thank you, God,
for still being there for me

44:05.373 --> 44:09.627
and allowing me to come
to you in my time of need.

44:12.129 --> 44:15.132
God, there are things happening
around me right now that I...

44:18.135 --> 44:19.636
I just don't understand.

44:23.556 --> 44:27.851
Some of these things make me feel
weak, helpless, afraid.

44:30.937 --> 44:32.897
My heart is troubled, Lord.

44:38.819 --> 44:41.154
But I will strive to keep it set on you,

44:41.279 --> 44:43.489
as your infinite wisdom will show me
the right way

44:43.614 --> 44:45.991
to adjust and right resolution here.

44:51.371 --> 44:53.289
Even in the midst of all this...

44:56.959 --> 44:58.752
I know you are the Lord.

44:59.878 --> 45:00.879
I know.

45:03.214 --> 45:06.133
And I know this situation
is in your hands.

45:10.303 --> 45:12.388
I know I need to trust in you again.

45:19.520 --> 45:24.191
I ask for strength and wisdom to help me
endure the battles which lay ahead, Lord.

45:26.651 --> 45:29.403
Please allow me to handle
what I must face in...

45:32.239 --> 45:35.533
in a way that would
only bring glory to your name.

45:41.121 --> 45:42.122
Amen.

45:54.092 --> 45:55.134
It's time.

45:58.637 --> 45:59.638
Okay.

46:49.518 --> 46:52.312
You fucking faithless cocksucker!

46:55.147 --> 46:59.693
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

46:59.818 --> 47:01.402
Thy kingdom come,

47:01.527 --> 47:05.364
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

47:06.073 --> 47:10.285
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

47:10.410 --> 47:14.330
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

47:14.455 --> 47:17.875
And lead us not into temptation,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.085
but deliver us from evil.

47:21.586 --> 47:26.173
Save me, oh, God. By Thy name,
by Thy might, defend my cause.

47:26.298 --> 47:30.093
Proud men have risen up against me.
Men of violence seek my life.

47:30.218 --> 47:32.595
But God is my helper.

47:32.720 --> 47:36.598
The Lord sustains my life,
and every need He has delivered to me.

47:37.557 --> 47:40.268
Glory be to the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

47:40.393 --> 47:41.852
As it was in the beginning,

47:41.977 --> 47:46.231
is now and forever shall be
world without end.

47:46.356 --> 47:47.774
Amen.

47:47.899 --> 47:52.111
Oh, Lord, hear our prayer,
and let our cry come unto Thee.

47:52.236 --> 47:56.323
Save your servant who places
her trust in Thee, my God.

47:56.448 --> 48:01.578
Be unto her, oh, Lord, a fortified tower
in the face of the enemy.

48:01.703 --> 48:05.123
Let the enemy have no power over her

48:05.248 --> 48:08.793
and the son of iniquity
be powerless to harm her.

48:08.918 --> 48:13.422
Oh, Lord, hear our prayer,
and let our cry come unto Thee.

48:13.547 --> 48:16.841
The Lord be with you and all of us.

48:16.966 --> 48:20.344
Fuck me, you dirty fucking pond scum!

48:40.027 --> 48:42.529
You suck it, fucker!

48:42.654 --> 48:45.198
Oh, mighty Father,

48:45.323 --> 48:49.160
everlasting God
and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ,

48:49.285 --> 48:52.246
who, once and for all,
consigned that fallen tyrant

48:52.371 --> 48:54.289
to the flames of hell,

48:54.414 --> 49:00.545
who sent your only begotten Son
into the world to crush that roaring lion.

49:00.670 --> 49:04.298
Hasten to our call for help
and snatch from ruination

49:04.423 --> 49:06.967
and from the clutches
of the noonday devil

49:07.092 --> 49:09.928
this human being made in your image
and your likeness.

49:10.053 --> 49:14.682
Strike terror, Lord, into the beast,
now laying waste your vineyard.

49:14.807 --> 49:18.268
Let your mighty hand cast him
out of your servant, Anna Ecklund,

49:18.393 --> 49:21.479
so he may no longer
hold captive this person

49:21.604 --> 49:24.064
whom it pleased to make in your image

49:24.189 --> 49:26.191
and to redeem through your Son,

49:26.316 --> 49:30.903
in the unity of the Holy Spirit
and of the Father.

49:31.028 --> 49:32.446
Amen.

49:32.571 --> 49:36.616
Oh, Lord, hear my prayer
and let my cry come unto Thee.

49:36.741 --> 49:41.162
Lord of all creation,
who gave your holy apostles the power

49:41.287 --> 49:46.083
to trample serpents
and scorpions underfoot.

49:46.208 --> 49:48.668
Stop, you fucking bastard!

49:52.380 --> 49:56.008
See the cross of the Lord.
Be gone, you hostile power.

49:56.133 --> 50:00.595
By this sign of the holy cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

50:00.720 --> 50:04.765
who lives and reigns
with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

50:05.932 --> 50:07.808
You want to fuck me, don't you?

50:08.809 --> 50:11.520
Fuck me. Fuck me!

50:23.279 --> 50:28.325
I cast you out, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!

50:29.242 --> 50:31.160
It was He who commands you...

50:31.285 --> 50:34.371
Suck his cock,
you shit-eating scumbag!

50:34.496 --> 50:36.623
To the depths of hell.

50:36.748 --> 50:40.501
- Be gone!
- Fuck him! Fuck him up the ass!

50:40.626 --> 50:43.420
Be gone from this creature of God!

50:43.545 --> 50:45.547
Faith is fucking vermin!

50:45.672 --> 50:51.135
Be gone, in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

50:51.260 --> 50:56.598
By this sign of the holy cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

50:56.723 --> 51:00.893
who lives and reigns
with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

51:02.436 --> 51:04.521
You abandoned your parents.

51:04.646 --> 51:09.776
They died alone
while you served your porcelain God!

51:09.901 --> 51:11.235
Do not listen to her!

51:11.360 --> 51:15.030
You selfish fucking bitch!

51:15.155 --> 51:16.990
They died screaming!

51:20.534 --> 51:25.247
Defender of the human race,
save your servant!

51:58.279 --> 52:00.572
This sow will die!

52:09.330 --> 52:12.207
I command you
by the judge of the living dead

52:12.332 --> 52:15.418
to depart from this servant of God.

52:15.543 --> 52:18.963
It is the power of Christ
that commands you.

52:20.255 --> 52:23.424
He brought you low
by His blood-stained cross.

52:23.549 --> 52:27.344
Do not despise my commands
because you know me to be a sinner.

52:27.469 --> 52:29.846
It is God Himself who commands you!

52:29.971 --> 52:33.307
The blood of the martyrs commands you!

52:33.432 --> 52:36.226
Give way to Christ,
you prince of murderers!

52:37.477 --> 52:40.146
You're guilty before almighty God,

52:40.271 --> 52:45.359
guilty before His Son,
guilty before the whole human race!

52:46.860 --> 52:49.445
It is the Lord who expels you!

52:49.570 --> 52:53.448
He who's coming to judge
both the living and the dead

52:53.573 --> 52:55.533
and the world by fire!

52:56.367 --> 52:58.178
He casts you out!

53:51.523 --> 53:54.651
Anna, is that you?

54:04.160 --> 54:05.494
Father?

54:13.084 --> 54:14.794
Thank the Lord.

54:38.901 --> 54:41.528
- How are you feeling?
- A lot better.

54:42.862 --> 54:45.197
- Does your head hurt?
- A little.

54:46.323 --> 54:47.532
This one's quite sore.

54:52.537 --> 54:56.415
- Just, um, give me a minute, okay?
- Okay.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.127
Father...

55:03.087 --> 55:04.088
thank you.

55:06.215 --> 55:07.841
Thank you so much.

55:11.219 --> 55:12.762
How can I ever repay you, Father?

55:13.637 --> 55:17.557
It wasn't just me, Jacob.
We all helped Anna.

55:17.682 --> 55:21.310
Whatever you did, it was incredible.

55:21.435 --> 55:24.104
- How is she?
- She's...

55:25.188 --> 55:29.108
- She's great.
- Does she remember anything?

55:29.233 --> 55:31.109
No, nothing.

55:33.027 --> 55:36.447
- Nothing?
- Nothing at all, Father. I'm sorry.

55:36.572 --> 55:39.449
- It's a good thing.
- It is.

55:39.574 --> 55:40.575
Good.

55:42.785 --> 55:43.786
Thank you.

56:00.301 --> 56:01.927
Are you all right, Sister?

56:02.052 --> 56:05.180
- What's wrong?
- I feel terrible.

56:05.305 --> 56:07.724
I think I'm gonna throw up.

56:07.849 --> 56:09.809
- Yeah.
- I'm burning up, too.

56:20.483 --> 56:21.692
Hello, Anna.

56:22.693 --> 56:24.486
How are you?

56:24.611 --> 56:27.405
- Much better.
- Good.

56:28.489 --> 56:31.283
Do you, uh... Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

56:32.325 --> 56:33.325
Sure.

56:34.243 --> 56:36.286
I'm Father Richard Lamont, by the way.

56:36.411 --> 56:38.788
I know. Jacob told me.

56:38.913 --> 56:41.206
Did your husband tell you
about anything that's happened?

56:41.331 --> 56:44.083
Only that I've been sick.

56:44.208 --> 56:46.919
He told me you and Father Reisinger
helped me, though.

56:47.044 --> 56:49.921
- Thank you, Father.
- Oh, it's no problem.

56:50.046 --> 56:51.630
You can call me Richard, by the way.

56:51.755 --> 56:52.756
- Or Rick.
- Okay.

56:52.881 --> 56:54.549
- Or Ricky.

56:54.674 --> 56:57.426
Call me Richard.

56:59.010 --> 57:03.014
Look, uh, do you remember
anything about being sick?

57:04.056 --> 57:05.432
No.

57:06.975 --> 57:10.269
'Cause I know you were ill like this
before, during your teenage years.

57:11.270 --> 57:12.270
Do you remember that?

57:12.354 --> 57:16.691
No. It's like I've lost gaps in time.

57:17.900 --> 57:21.737
Yeah, tell me about it. We all do.

57:21.862 --> 57:25.073
My memory's not the same as it was,
let me tell you that.

57:29.035 --> 57:31.328
Do you have any special abilities, Anna?

57:33.788 --> 57:36.916
- What do you mean?
- Any skills out of the ordinary? Maybe...

57:37.875 --> 57:39.852
Maybe something that you've shared
with other people

57:39.876 --> 57:41.794
and they don't understand.

57:43.796 --> 57:45.339
I don't think so.

57:51.219 --> 57:53.054
I spoke with your friend Laura.

57:58.726 --> 58:01.687
She told me how you helped her mother.

58:02.688 --> 58:05.565
I asked her not to say anything.

58:05.690 --> 58:06.691
Why?

58:08.567 --> 58:10.247
Helping someone
is a wonderful thing, Anna.

58:10.318 --> 58:14.363
I don't know. I just...
I don't want anyone to know.

58:14.488 --> 58:16.114
I don't want the attention.

58:16.239 --> 58:19.617
Everything you tell me will be treated
in the strictest confidence, okay?

58:19.742 --> 58:22.453
I worry the church will not approve.

58:22.578 --> 58:25.289
You don't have to worry about the church.

58:25.414 --> 58:28.959
This conversation will remain between us.
No problem, okay?

58:30.001 --> 58:32.294
Okay. Thank you.

58:34.170 --> 58:37.047
Do you remember when you realized
you had that ability?

58:38.757 --> 58:40.216
When I was a teenager.

58:42.635 --> 58:45.220
- Did anybody know about that?
- No.

58:46.721 --> 58:50.516
Being able to do things like that
scares me.

58:50.641 --> 58:51.642
Why?

58:52.643 --> 58:54.102
Because it makes me different.

58:55.228 --> 59:01.567
It's okay to be different sometimes, Anna.
You know? We all have our own destiny.

59:01.692 --> 59:05.278
It just takes time for us
to accept, that's all.

59:06.112 --> 59:10.282
I don't know. The church forbids us
to believe in things like that.

59:11.533 --> 59:12.700
Yes.

59:13.951 --> 59:18.246
Well, then, maybe it's time for us
to be more open-minded.

59:29.173 --> 59:34.094
Sister Abigail and Sister Madeline
have reported sickness. They're very ill.

59:34.219 --> 59:37.597
- And how are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

59:37.722 --> 59:42.560
Well, it's been a very...
a very stressful experience.

59:42.685 --> 59:46.230
Perhaps it's a... a delayed shock.

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:13.628
So... how are you feeling, Richard?

01:00:15.963 --> 01:00:17.714
I'm just sitting here thinking, Theo.

01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:21.133
You saw the statue
during the exorcism, didn't you?

01:00:23.426 --> 01:00:24.635
Yes.

01:00:27.804 --> 01:00:31.057
It's the same one I saw in Ireland.
I mentioned it. Do you remember?

01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:33.767
The one weeping tears of blood?

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.106
I remember.

01:00:42.733 --> 01:00:47.446
In Ireland, one of the locals claimed
to have received two significant messages

01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:49.447
whilst praying at the statue.

01:00:50.364 --> 01:00:51.365
What were they?

01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:56.953
The first was, "Satan is now among us."

01:00:58.329 --> 01:00:59.413
And the other?

01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:05.626
The second...

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:11.506
I remember it well.
I've thought about it a lot.

01:01:12.298 --> 01:01:15.092
"Out of the thorns will come a rose
who will deliver us from Satan

01:01:15.217 --> 01:01:16.635
by the blood of the Lamb."

01:01:21.056 --> 01:01:23.725
Do you think
this is some sort of prophecy?

01:01:24.475 --> 01:01:29.104
Maybe. I spoke to one of Anna's friends.

01:01:29.229 --> 01:01:32.273
She mentioned
a couple of significant incidents.

01:01:33.649 --> 01:01:35.692
I've spoken to Anna about them.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:41.155
What kind of, uh...
What kind of incidents?

01:01:43.615 --> 01:01:46.284
Well, Anna has this...

01:01:48.786 --> 01:01:50.996
I don't know how to put this.

01:01:51.121 --> 01:01:54.707
Anna has the ability to heal, Theo.

01:01:54.832 --> 01:01:59.586
- Do you believe in that sort of thing?
- Well, I'm skeptical. You?

01:01:59.711 --> 01:02:03.673
My skepticism is fading.

01:02:04.799 --> 01:02:08.302
But what's the significance of this?

01:02:10.887 --> 01:02:13.764
Well, you've heard
of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, right?

01:02:13.889 --> 01:02:17.225
The Jesuit priest. Yes.

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:23.939
Chardin conceived the idea
that evolution was progressing to a goal,

01:02:24.064 --> 01:02:28.318
the maximum level of complexity
and consciousness called the Omega Point.

01:02:29.193 --> 01:02:32.905
Chardin believed
that those with the dual powers,

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:37.034
powers of a psychic and healing nature,
had a spiritual gift also,

01:02:37.159 --> 01:02:39.828
which will one day be shared
by the whole of humanity

01:02:39.953 --> 01:02:43.873
in a kind of global consciousness.

01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:47.084
Look, what has this got to do with Anna?

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.380
I don't believe she was
randomly chosen. No.

01:02:55.383 --> 01:02:57.426
Chardin's works came to mind

01:02:57.652 --> 01:03:00.237
because he believed
that those with the dual gifts,

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:02.864
those who are the greater good, Theo,

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:05.950
they attract the greatest evil.

01:03:06.075 --> 01:03:09.912
If de Chardin theorized the world
is moving towards a new consciousness

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:12.330
led by those who have the special gifts,

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.374
then evil will go
to extraordinary lengths to hinder

01:03:15.499 --> 01:03:18.835
and even kill those capable
of leading that movement.

01:03:20.378 --> 01:03:26.217
For evil to prosper, Theo, the world
must be in a negative state of being.

01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:29.595
The gifts of the greater good...

01:03:30.846 --> 01:03:32.597
they face the ultimate test

01:03:32.722 --> 01:03:35.558
when they go head to head
with the greatest evil.

01:03:42.565 --> 01:03:44.149
Are you all right, Sister?

01:03:44.274 --> 01:03:48.027
God is not with us anymore.

01:04:42.994 --> 01:04:44.370
What the hell is going on here?

01:04:44.495 --> 01:04:47.206
It wasn't just one demon inside Anna.
There were many.

01:04:47.956 --> 01:04:49.958
When we cast them out,
they found new hosts.

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:53.961
- We should call the police.
- We should deal with them ourselves.

01:04:54.086 --> 01:04:56.671
Deal with them ourselves?
Another exorcism?

01:04:56.796 --> 01:04:59.381
The real key to all this, Jacob...

01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:01.965
it's you, Anna.

01:05:02.716 --> 01:05:05.593
- Me?
- Yes.

01:05:05.718 --> 01:05:08.679
You know about the origin
of the Passover, don't you?

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.180
Yeah.

01:05:10.305 --> 01:05:14.309
You remember in the Book of Exodus
when the Hebrews took the lamb's blood

01:05:14.434 --> 01:05:17.103
and smeared it over the doorframes
to protect their houses

01:05:17.228 --> 01:05:18.604
from... from the last plague?

01:05:18.729 --> 01:05:19.997
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you remember that?

01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:23.024
It was the foretelling
of the coming of Christ.

01:05:23.149 --> 01:05:26.318
And we all know that Jesus
was known as the Lamb of God.

01:05:27.235 --> 01:05:28.903
Why are you telling me this?

01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:33.448
Because, Anna, to the evil out there...

01:05:34.782 --> 01:05:36.074
you are the Lamb.

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:38.966
You're the protector of all that's good.

01:05:39.034 --> 01:05:42.120
What the hell are you talking about?
This is my wife!

01:05:42.245 --> 01:05:44.455
Please, Jacob! Please.

01:05:45.622 --> 01:05:47.206
It's gonna be okay.

01:05:48.332 --> 01:05:51.710
Okay? You're all right.

01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:18.086
- How did you know that would work?
- I just knew.

01:07:23.424 --> 01:07:25.426
That's why you're the key.

01:07:27.136 --> 01:07:29.054
All you have to do is accept your destiny.

01:08:08.214 --> 01:08:11.508
Anna, it's time to fulfill your destiny.

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:15.386
- Father, just leave her alone.
- It's okay, Jacob.

01:08:15.511 --> 01:08:19.598
I know what I'm supposed to do now.
I'm not frightened anymore.

01:08:28.648 --> 01:08:29.732
I'll stand with you.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.328
All three of us will stand together.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.886
Our Father who art in heaven...

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.638
hallowed be Thy name.

01:09:03.763 --> 01:09:07.390
- Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...

01:10:50.199 --> 01:10:51.700
It is accomplished.
