WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:04.572
Previously on ER:

00:04.605 --> 00:06.574
See? Didn't even hurt.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:15.183 --> 00:17.218
What should I tell Weaver?

00:17.251 --> 00:18.286
Whatever you want.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.353
Someone has died.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.254
Who?

00:20.288 --> 00:21.589
Someone named Kovac,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.625
a Dr. Luka Kovac.

00:24.658 --> 00:25.793
You're going to go back there?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.295
Why?
'Cause I left him there.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.296
Left him where?

00:28.329 --> 00:30.464
At a clinic in Matenda.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.757
You sober?

00:59.793 --> 01:01.195
I'm sorry?

01:01.229 --> 01:03.197
You look sober.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.199
I make it a rule
to always land

01:05.233 --> 01:07.268
in Kinshasa drunk.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.137
It's my third.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.139
Steve Davidson.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.508
John Carter.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.709
Oh. Shell? Xerox?

01:15.743 --> 01:16.744
No?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.312
( chuckles )

01:18.346 --> 01:19.580
You give me a second,
I'll figure it out.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.814
I would say,

01:20.848 --> 01:22.883
Coke out of Atlanta.
Am I right?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.319
The new bottling plant?

01:25.353 --> 01:26.454
Sorry, no.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.455
Excusez moi.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.856
May I have
another Dewar's,

01:28.889 --> 01:30.291
please?

01:30.324 --> 01:31.492
Could I get
you something?

01:31.525 --> 01:33.627
No.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.495
Okay, I give up.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.796
Who are you with?

01:35.829 --> 01:37.798
I'm just here
on a personal matter.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.833
Oh.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.603
Well, there's not much
competition

01:42.636 --> 01:44.572
for the seats, is there?

01:44.605 --> 01:47.708
I guess the "See a Brutal
Genocide" tour package

01:47.741 --> 01:49.243
didn't sell very well.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.280
( laughs )

01:52.313 --> 01:54.748
So what about you?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.817
Why are you going to the Congo?

01:56.850 --> 01:58.252
I'm with the Embassy.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.221
Financial Liaison.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.856
Furthering the
American investment
interest abroad.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.425
Spreading the

02:04.458 --> 02:08.729
Democratic ideals
one Big Mac at a time.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.898
Merci.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.302
So, a personal matter, huh?

02:14.335 --> 02:16.870
A friend of mine was murdered.
I'm going to go bring him home.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.806
Oh.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.875
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.344
DAVIDSON:
If you need to see

02:23.377 --> 02:25.446
a familiar face
while you're in Kinshasa,

02:25.479 --> 02:26.514
you give me a call.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.848
Thanks.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.218
S'il vous plaît,
monsieur?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.688
Vos papiers,
s'il vous plaît.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.429
John!

02:55.309 --> 02:57.378
( sobbing )

02:57.411 --> 02:59.347
So, what happened?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.851
We don't know.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.288
What about Patrique?

03:07.321 --> 03:08.956
He's still missing.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.327
Was the Red Cross able
to recover Luka's body?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.964
Excuse me.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.936
10,000 people have been killed
in the last

03:22.970 --> 03:24.572
two weeks.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.275
There are many bodies in Kivu.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.470
How much longer
do we have to wait?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.439
It's the Congo.
Could be days.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.007
( sighs ):
Oh.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.343
How are you feeling?

04:35.343 --> 04:37.678
Oh. Terrible.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.381
Who are we waiting for? I...

04:40.414 --> 04:41.549
Please. No more talking.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.617
MAN:
Gillian?

04:43.651 --> 04:44.818
Bonjour.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.454
Salut.
Huh?

04:46.487 --> 04:48.956
Hmm.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.924
Andre, Je te présente
John Carter.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.527
C'est un docteur
Américain.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.363
Dr. Carter.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.365
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.867
Please.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.836
Can you tell us what happened?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.772
No, I'm afraid not.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.707
After numerous attempts,

05:06.740 --> 05:08.842
we were able
to negotiate a passage

05:08.876 --> 05:10.544
into the Mai Mai-held territory

05:10.578 --> 05:13.547
to evacuate wounded
noncombatants.

05:13.581 --> 05:17.585
The Mai Mai provided us
with a list of the known dead.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.586
( clears throat )

05:18.619 --> 05:19.887
That's it?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.055
They also provided us

05:22.089 --> 05:24.525
with some personal items

05:24.558 --> 05:26.994
to identify remains.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.653
Can we get the body back?

05:52.686 --> 05:55.423
Are there ways
that that can be arranged?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.026
Yeah. I'm sorry.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.861
Um...

06:02.663 --> 06:03.997
When the
fighting stops,

06:04.031 --> 06:06.534
we'll make every effort
to identify remains.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.901
How long will
that take?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.102
I have no idea.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.672
Days? Weeks? Months?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.974
Someone from the negotiating
team might know more.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.510
Can we speak with them?

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
They're in Kisangani.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.713
Debbie?

06:19.747 --> 06:22.082
And Gerard.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.517
Have you tried Bob Chase

06:23.551 --> 06:24.985
from the American Embassy?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.455
He has contacts with
the Congolese Army.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.490
He may be able to help you.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.561
Who's Debbie?

06:33.594 --> 06:37.097
She's with the Red Cross
field office in Kisangani.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.200
You'd like her.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.570
She's your type.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.573
What's my type?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.679
We shouldn't have left him
out there.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.813
He didn't want us to stay.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.716
Should have
stayed anyway.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.885
Then you'd be dead, too.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.505
CHARLES:
Gillian, we have to go,

07:17.505 --> 07:19.507
or we won't get back
before dark.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.674
( whispering ):
Go, go, go.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.644
( sniffles )

07:34.855 --> 07:37.024
What should I tell Weaver?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.760
Whatever you want.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.531
Can I tell her
you're coming back?

07:44.632 --> 07:46.834
I don't know.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.905
Don't do anything stupid.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.942
Like what?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.978
Like getting yourself killed.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.609
MAN:
He wasn't an American citizen?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.177
CARTER:
No, but he'd been living
and working

08:30.210 --> 08:31.311
in the States for years.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.712
You might have
better luck

08:32.746 --> 08:34.014
going to his
embassy for help.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.582
It's tough for us
to make inquiries

08:35.582 --> 08:37.150
on behalf of
citizens of
another country.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.687
Does Croatia have an embassy
in the Congo?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.321
Croatia?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.890
No.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.958
He was a close friend?

08:44.992 --> 08:49.329
Yeah. We've worked together
for years.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.230
( sighs )

08:50.263 --> 08:52.032
The Mai Mai believe

08:52.065 --> 08:54.768
that foreigners are looting
the Congo's natural resources.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.771
They see us as the enemy.

08:57.805 --> 09:01.008
It is very dangerous
for Westerners.

09:01.041 --> 09:05.045
Um, can some sort of exchange
be set up for the dead?

09:05.078 --> 09:09.049
I mean, aren't those things
normally done?

09:11.018 --> 09:12.252
These guys don't know

09:12.285 --> 09:14.287
about the Geneva Convention,
Doctor.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.657
Most of them don't know
about shoes.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.728
Nothing?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.863
He said to be patient.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.068
What?

09:28.101 --> 09:29.637
Excuse me.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.172
Can you tell me,
is Mr. Davidson working today?

09:32.205 --> 09:34.908
DAVIDSON:
What did Bob Chase tell you?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.777
That we'd have
to be patient.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.014
Oh, I'm sure
that he knows
better than I.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.653
There have to be other channels
that we could pursue.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.188
Well, have you tried
the UN offices or the Red Cross?

09:48.221 --> 09:51.725
Yeah. We've been bouncing around
from office to office all day.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.327
Oh, I'm sure they're trying
everything they can.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.268
Look, Dr. Carter,

10:01.301 --> 10:03.637
I am not suggesting this,

10:03.671 --> 10:05.038
but my experience has been

10:05.072 --> 10:06.840
that there's not much
in this country

10:06.874 --> 10:08.876
that can't be bought.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.111
Quatre-vingt seize,
quatre-vingt dix-sept,

10:11.144 --> 10:13.380
quatre-vingt dix-huit,
quatre-vingt dix-neuf.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.316
Vingt mille
dollars Américains.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.055
Merci.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.190
What's he saying?

10:23.223 --> 10:24.892
Well, he's just
a little concerned

10:24.925 --> 10:26.960
that you're going
to walk around Kinshasa

10:26.994 --> 10:29.162
with $20,000
in your pocket.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.864
What does he expect me
to do with it,

10:30.898 --> 10:32.132
stick it in my shoe?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.433
Well, it may
not be safe

10:33.466 --> 10:35.703
to carry that much
cash in the Congo.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.705
It's not safe to carry
that much cash anywhere,

10:37.738 --> 10:38.939
but I don't think

10:38.972 --> 10:40.841
the Mai Mai take
travelers' checks.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.910
You can afford
to put $20,000

10:42.943 --> 10:46.279
on your
credit card?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.851
( loud moving vehicle
engine approaching )

11:04.932 --> 11:06.800
FAC.

11:06.834 --> 11:07.968
Government soldiers.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.002
Heading west,

11:09.036 --> 11:11.171
away from Kivu.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.240
They're retreating.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.043
The Mai Mai will come
again soon.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.407
( shouting )

11:47.440 --> 11:48.475
Oh, God.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.377
Refugees from the fighting.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.213
More come every day.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.783
The hospital is worse.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.193
I'll put these
in your room.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.295
Give me that
big one there.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.329
Thanks.

12:10.530 --> 12:14.367
( children squealing, shouting )

12:20.573 --> 12:21.809
Still working bankers' hours,

12:21.809 --> 12:22.943
I see.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.212
Hello, Doctor.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.279
( zipping )

12:26.313 --> 12:28.081
I'm so sorry about Luka.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.482
How are you holding up?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.084
Doing what we can.

12:31.118 --> 12:34.187
I brought you some things.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.956
Sterile gloves,

12:35.989 --> 12:38.558
needles, catheters,
syringes,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.160
IV Ceftriaxone
and Cipro.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.328
( chuckles )

12:41.361 --> 12:42.462
DPL sets,

12:42.495 --> 12:45.966
suture kits,
old pulse ox...

12:45.999 --> 12:47.134
Ooh, look at this.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.568
Microscope.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.970
Tried to get
a portable X ray

12:50.003 --> 12:51.238
but it wouldn't fit
in my carry-on.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.472
Where did you get all of that?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.307
My hospital in Chicago
donated it.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.976
Do they know they donated it?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.078
Yeah, more or less.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.947
Tout est pret, Docteur.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.849
You busy?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.884
Ten-year-old
with an abdominal GSW

13:03.917 --> 13:04.852
and gross hematuria.

13:04.885 --> 13:05.919
I'm not a surgeon.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.087
Dominic's assisting,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.389
and he never finished
the sixth grade.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.325
Kétamine
et poinction lombaire.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.541
We still have
enough amoxicillin?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.278
Oh.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.113
Are you feeling
all right, Doctor?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.581
I'm just tired.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.056
Merci, Docteur.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.112
I'll need help.
Set me up with lidocaine,

14:05.145 --> 14:07.915
a suture kit
and a scalpel.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.216
You'll be fine.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.490
GILLIAN ( over radio ):
Base to mic One.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.427
Luka, Patrique, are you there?

14:21.461 --> 14:25.532
Luka, are you there? Over.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.100
Mic one to base.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.269
Bonjour, Gillian. On est là.

14:29.302 --> 14:34.274
Luka, the fighting is getting
heavy east of you. Copy.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.408
Copy that.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.177
Have you had any problems?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.179
No, no.
Patients are improving.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.613
I'm going to revise the
flap on the little girl

14:40.647 --> 14:42.382
in a few minutes.

14:42.415 --> 14:46.519
You warned Patrique
what he's in for, right?

14:48.055 --> 14:50.623
He's tough.
He'll be fine.

14:50.657 --> 14:55.128
Um, I should go.
Save the batteries. Over.

14:55.162 --> 14:59.967
Okay. Be safe. Clear.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.436
Yeah, you, too. Out.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.207
Docteur? Docteur?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.615
There she is.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.052
Debbie.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.186
Hey.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.354
Gillian.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.093
This is Dr. Carter.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.029
Uh, he was a
friend of Luka's.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.663
Oh...

16:03.696 --> 16:05.098
I'm very sorry, Dr. Carter.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.499
Thank you.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.468
The ICRC in Kinshasa
said that you were part

16:08.501 --> 16:09.769
of the negotiating team,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.171
that you might have
some information

16:11.204 --> 16:12.339
about what happened to Luka.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.074
No, sorry.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.076
They just gave us the list
and a few personal items.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.744
Steve Davidson,

16:17.777 --> 16:20.347
American Embassy, said maybe
you could get us into Kivu.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.482
I'm trying to recover
Dr. Kovac's body.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.254
And I've brought a substantial
amount of cash along

16:27.287 --> 16:30.423
with me to spread around
if you think that might help.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.424
How much cash?

16:31.458 --> 16:32.725
$20,000.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.061
( whistles )

16:34.094 --> 16:37.730
Wow. That's a lot of cash.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.168
I work
for the Red Cross, Doctor.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.271
Our safety is dependent
on our neutrality.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.473
If any of the various armies
or militia involved in this mess

16:46.506 --> 16:48.275
knew we were giving money
to the enemy,

16:48.308 --> 16:50.577
money that could be used to buy
weapons or food, we'd be dead.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.312
And I don't mean
dead in the water.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.215
I mean, "head mounted
on a sharpened stick" dead.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.687
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.589
You didn't.
I was led
to believe

17:02.622 --> 17:03.656
that money can sometimes
be helpful

17:03.690 --> 17:05.258
in situations like this.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.330
So, what'll it take
to get his body back?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.332
Time.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.333
How much time?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.402
It's hard to say.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.406
Thanks, Debbie.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.175
Sure.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.846
I told you
she was your type.

17:26.878 --> 17:27.780
( chuckling ):
What?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.249
Not at all.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.583
Hey!

17:31.318 --> 17:33.320
Richie Rich.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.654
We've been negotiating
to get into Kivu

17:34.687 --> 17:36.289
for more of the wounded.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.125
I could use a doc
to help transport 'em.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.459
Somebody in one of the camps

17:39.492 --> 17:40.760
might know something
about your friend.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.730
Okay. Thanks.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.267
She's definitely
not my type.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.136
Yeah, right.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.786
Dr. Luka. Doctor.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.156
Doctor! Please,
we have to go.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.390
What?

18:11.491 --> 18:12.392
You have a fever.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.593
Malaria?

18:13.626 --> 18:17.164
I'm fine.
Why did you wake me?

18:17.164 --> 18:18.398
The Mai Mai are in Masenga.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.567
They are burning
the village.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.909
GILLIAN:
You were pretty
hard on him.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.444
Who?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.380
John.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.751
He's cute, don't you think?

19:11.784 --> 19:12.885
Not again.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.221
What was the last one?

19:14.221 --> 19:15.522
The surgeon from Atlanta?

19:16.823 --> 19:19.626
Turned out he had a wife
and five kids.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.927
So?

19:35.408 --> 19:36.543
You need medicine.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.810
I'll just fend it off.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.612
We have some
IV quinine left.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.780
Save it for the boy.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.315
He's getting better.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.417
I'm not that sick.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.786
PATRIQUE:
I'll go get it.

19:46.819 --> 19:47.887
No!

19:49.389 --> 19:52.392
Save it for the boy, okay?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.261
Oh, my God.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.335
You guys burned the clinic
to the ground?!

20:38.738 --> 20:40.607
You guys...

20:41.908 --> 20:43.576
You guys keep
burning down hospitals.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.378
Where are you going to go
when you get shot, huh?

20:45.412 --> 20:50.450
Where are you going to go
when your mothers get sick?!

20:50.483 --> 20:52.585
CHARLES:
Dr. John!

21:32.825 --> 21:35.962
He says many
people died here.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.365
They took the
bodies to Kasese.

21:38.398 --> 21:41.601
He thinks they're
still there.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.657
Doctor?

22:05.892 --> 22:09.061
( sniffles )

22:09.095 --> 22:10.430
What time is it?

22:10.463 --> 22:12.565
Early.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.436
( groans )

22:16.469 --> 22:17.804
Where is everyone?

22:17.837 --> 22:18.605
They left.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.473
Where did they go?

22:20.507 --> 22:23.142
They didn't want
the Mai Mai to
find them with us.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.111
( shivering ):
With me, you mean.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.446
They should go, too.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.114
They are worried about you.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.115
Give me your arm.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.116
Why?

22:30.149 --> 22:32.084
You need medicine.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.787
I told you to save the quinine
for the boy.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.656
I gave him one bag, and
kept the other for you.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.425
Give me your arm.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.461
( blows air )

22:41.494 --> 22:45.031
They should go
while they can.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.700
Pars, fais attention.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.736
No!

22:52.071 --> 22:53.940
You, too, go.
I'll be fine.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.744
Just leave me the radio.
Take them there to safety.

22:57.777 --> 22:58.778
I'll be all right.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.146
We don't have the radio.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.715
We must have left
it at the camp.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.619
When Charles comes, he'll look
for us at the clinic first.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.187
It should be safe
again by now.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.958
The Mai Mai will
have already stolen
everything and left.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.125
He's dead, Doctor.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.561
I know you want to get him back,

23:14.594 --> 23:15.928
but Kasese is ten miles
from here.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.997
Plantez l'autre la-bas.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.966
I was happy to stop
in Matenda 'cause
it was on the way.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.601
So just give me a vehicle.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.102
After we've triaged here,
I'll have it back.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.738
No, okay? No.
And don't make me
regret bringing you.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.811
She won't do it.

23:31.844 --> 23:35.615
Je regrette mama, on n'a rien
avec nous pour vous soigner.

23:35.648 --> 23:36.983
What's her complaint?

23:37.016 --> 23:39.185
She's afraid
she might be pregnant.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.487
She was raped.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.121
They all were.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.496
There are more injured
down there.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.740
Bon jour.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.543
I'm going to examine you, okay?

24:09.181 --> 24:11.618
Gillian!

24:11.651 --> 24:13.152
GILLIAN:
What?
Gillian!

24:14.053 --> 24:16.122
I know you, don't I?

24:16.155 --> 24:17.256
They were at the Clinic.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.525
They were at Matenda
when we left.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.559
The boy had pertussis.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.736
Les Mai Mai sont venus.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.705
( both speaking French )

24:32.739 --> 24:34.874
GILLIAN:
Mai Mai came.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.551
I think they have gone.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.945
Keep walking.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.294
( metallic thud )

25:32.732 --> 25:33.766
Halte.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.668
Keep going.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.742
J'ai dit halte.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.779
Bon jour.

25:46.813 --> 25:49.181
Nous sommes les doc...

25:57.990 --> 26:00.292
Do you want a beer?

26:02.161 --> 26:03.663
Beer?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.732
It's warm,
tastes like formaldehyde

26:05.765 --> 26:08.801
but it's wet.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.303
Hmm.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.706
No, thanks.

26:13.740 --> 26:14.741
( sighs )

26:14.774 --> 26:17.877
What is that thing, a radio?

26:17.910 --> 26:20.346
iPod.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.048
Digital music player.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.651
Fancy.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.318
What are you listening to?

26:26.352 --> 26:31.123
Les Nubians, the Nubians.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.759
No Dixie Chicks?

26:32.792 --> 26:34.060
No Dixie Chicks.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.664
Mm, you don't like
the Dixie Chicks?

26:37.664 --> 26:40.032
( blows raspberry )

26:42.434 --> 26:44.704
So they just left him there?

26:44.737 --> 26:48.074
In the jungle?

26:49.075 --> 26:50.242
The Congolese were afraid

26:50.276 --> 26:53.112
to be found
with Luka and Patrique.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.782
And that's all he knew?

26:55.815 --> 26:58.017
That's all he knew.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.888
Do you ever get worried
that these guys

27:01.921 --> 27:04.323
are going to get bored
and just start shooting?

27:04.356 --> 27:05.792
I don't think about it.

27:05.825 --> 27:10.062
If I did, I'd probably
never leave Seattle.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.131
You know,

27:12.164 --> 27:14.701
I consider myself
reasonably well-informed...

27:16.068 --> 27:18.004
...but before I came,
I hadn't heard a thing

27:18.037 --> 27:20.940
about the Congo.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.176
Nobody at home gives a damn
what happens out here.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.779
There's no oil here.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.949
Millions of people
are slaughtered...

27:29.982 --> 27:33.720
and we're too busy...
eating Happy Meals.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.860
What are you doing here?

27:40.893 --> 27:43.262
You don't seem
the type.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.765
What's the type?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.734
Macho, adrenaline junkies

27:47.734 --> 27:49.335
and save-the-world
peacenik freaks.

27:49.368 --> 27:53.205
( laughing )

27:53.239 --> 27:54.273
Which one are you?

27:54.306 --> 27:55.341
( laughs )

27:55.374 --> 27:58.978
Which do you think?

28:01.814 --> 28:06.118
I... don't know
what I'm doing out here.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.358
I've been seeing this woman.

28:12.391 --> 28:16.495
She's great...
but it ain't good,

28:16.528 --> 28:19.932
for her or for me.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.303
It's simpler here.

28:26.205 --> 28:30.076
People need help,
I can help them.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.784
I'm sorry.

28:37.817 --> 28:41.320
I think I'm... tired.

28:46.859 --> 28:49.261
You should get some rest.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.362
I'm getting up early.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.931
We'll take the Rover
over to Kasese

28:51.964 --> 28:53.800
while they load the trucks.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.503
See what we can find out.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.307
Thanks.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.894
( Kovac shivering )

29:23.262 --> 29:25.832
Is she still in there?

29:26.498 --> 29:29.035
PATRIQUE:
Yes.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.537
You speak English?

29:32.538 --> 29:36.876
Please, I speak no French.

29:36.909 --> 29:40.880
Do you know what
are they going
to do with us?

29:40.913 --> 29:42.982
They're waiting
for someone to come

29:43.015 --> 29:44.250
and tell them what to do.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.954
Can you tell them
I'm a geologist.

29:47.987 --> 29:51.090
I'm not involved
in the war.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.192
I'm only here for rocks.

29:53.225 --> 29:57.396
( vehicle rapidly approaching )

29:59.565 --> 30:04.436
Another truck with soldiers.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.253
They're coming.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.616
Can you see?

30:51.383 --> 30:53.119
No.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.888
( gunshot )

30:55.922 --> 30:58.991
Oh, God.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.327
PATRIQUE:
They are coming back.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.413
Damn, Gillian,

31:21.447 --> 31:24.383
how can you smoke this
early in the morning?

31:28.220 --> 31:31.323
So what made you
change your mind?

31:31.357 --> 31:32.992
About what?

31:33.025 --> 31:35.494
About coming out here.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.029
Come a hell of a long way,

31:37.063 --> 31:38.330
I figured the least I could do

31:38.364 --> 31:41.067
was help you
get the last few miles.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.112
Here we go.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.114
What was this place?

32:28.147 --> 32:31.017
DEBBIE:
A school, I think.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.519
MAI MAI:
Les cadavres de Matenda
sont a l'interieur.

32:33.552 --> 32:37.089
He says the bodies from
the clinic are inside.

32:41.027 --> 32:44.530
You don't have to.
We can just go.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.457
Are you religious, Patrique?

33:11.490 --> 33:12.658
No.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.767
I was raised in the church.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.469
Catholic.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.372
I used to go
twice a week with my mother.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.114
It was beautiful.

33:41.353 --> 33:45.691
I liked the music, the singing.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.259
Do you still go?

33:47.293 --> 33:49.495
No.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.431
I stopped
when my children were killed.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.800
I couldn't believe in a God

33:54.833 --> 33:58.237
that would allow
such cruel things to happen.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.382
It's probably hard to feel
the Holy Spirit's presence

34:11.417 --> 34:14.120
on a day like today.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.295
( gunshot )

34:31.670 --> 34:34.172
I'm sorry, Patrique.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.308
I shouldn't have
let you stay.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.145
Nous sommes docteurs,

34:39.178 --> 34:41.580
pas des FAC ou des RCD.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.649
Alliance des
Médecines Internacional.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.818
C'est notre clinique...
on n'assiste...

34:46.851 --> 34:48.887
On donnes des medicaments
aux maladees.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.522
On n'assiste...

34:59.231 --> 35:02.534
( coughing, gagging )

35:10.876 --> 35:13.445
( coughing )

35:13.479 --> 35:15.247
My God.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.889
( coughing )

35:27.459 --> 35:29.261
Gillian, stay outside.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.655
( gasps )

36:00.892 --> 36:02.394
Eh, laba.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.765
Laba.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.265
It isn't him.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.399
What?

36:40.432 --> 36:41.900
This isn't Luka!

36:41.933 --> 36:43.435
What?!

36:43.469 --> 36:44.803
Ask him!

36:44.836 --> 36:46.505
Was he there
when these men were killed?

36:46.538 --> 36:49.908
( speaking French )

36:49.941 --> 36:51.510
This man!
Did you see this man?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.412
Where is this man?
( speaking French )

36:53.445 --> 36:54.446
Le, le pretre.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.481
What's he saying?

36:55.514 --> 36:56.515
Le pretre?

36:56.548 --> 36:57.549
Le pretre. Il y etait.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.017
What's he saying?

36:59.050 --> 37:01.353
He says that Luka is a priest.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.388
A what?

37:02.421 --> 37:03.889
A priest!

37:05.424 --> 37:08.860
( grunting )

37:12.464 --> 37:16.902
No, please, please,
no, no, no...

37:18.404 --> 37:21.440
( two gunshots )

38:53.031 --> 38:58.036
( speaking Croatian )

39:12.684 --> 39:16.522
( speaking Croatian )

39:21.527 --> 39:26.998
( speaking Croatian )

39:30.201 --> 39:31.703
Joshua!

39:31.737 --> 39:33.038
Pretre.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.779
Tu est pretre?

39:40.812 --> 39:41.813
Dis, tu es pretre?

39:41.847 --> 39:42.814
Oui!

39:42.848 --> 39:44.082
Il est pretre.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.685
C'est un homme de Dieu.

39:50.088 --> 39:53.492
( speaking Croatian )

40:01.667 --> 40:07.906
Mon pere, benissez-moi
je vous prie.

40:07.939 --> 40:12.578
( speaking Croatian )

40:15.614 --> 40:21.086
( Kovac speaking Croatian )

41:19.244 --> 41:21.012
Le pretre.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.158
Luka...

41:34.560 --> 41:36.662
Is he alive?

41:54.212 --> 41:55.847
Thank you.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.152
Thank you.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.114
Hey...

42:29.147 --> 42:30.682
Hey!

42:30.716 --> 42:32.851
How you feeling?

42:32.884 --> 42:35.020
Terrible.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.955
Where am I going?

42:36.988 --> 42:39.725
Home.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.092
Where's that?

42:41.126 --> 42:42.360
America.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.663
Got a medical transport plane
in Kinshasa

42:44.696 --> 42:47.065
waiting to take
you back.

42:47.098 --> 42:48.333
Expensive.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.902
I know somebody
who knows somebody.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.843
Give this to Abby
when you see her.

42:57.876 --> 43:00.145
You're not coming?

43:00.178 --> 43:02.681
I think I'm going
to stick around for a while.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.120
If she asks,

43:09.154 --> 43:11.122
just tell her...

43:13.424 --> 43:16.294
tell her I was lost,
and now I'm found.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.274
Thank you.

43:50.361 --> 43:53.364
Well, back to work.

43:56.702 --> 43:59.938
You really don't like
the Dixie Chicks?

43:59.971 --> 44:02.273
Everybody likes
the Dixie Chicks.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.076
Everybody?

44:05.110 --> 44:07.145
Everybody with any taste.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.719
