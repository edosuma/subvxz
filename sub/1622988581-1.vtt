00:15.732 --> 00:16.968
Happy
Fourth of July

00:17.034 --> 00:19.669
to everybody out in the
beautiful US of A tonight.

00:19.736 --> 00:22.006
How about some tunes
for those barbecues?

00:22.073 --> 00:22.940
All right.

00:24.809 --> 00:27.611
Oh yeah, I'm having the
best Fourth of July ever.

00:27.677 --> 00:30.680
Driving through these
dark ass woods all alone.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.985
It's cool, it's
fine, it's great.

00:35.685 --> 00:36.921
Fucking kill me.

00:47.064 --> 00:48.565
No fucking way.

00:49.533 --> 00:50.700
No fucking way.

00:51.936 --> 00:52.837
Shit.

01:04.949 --> 01:06.616
I didn't think I'd
be able to hear

01:06.683 --> 01:09.921
fireworks from all
the way out here.

01:12.123 --> 01:13.657
Fucking bullshit.

01:19.897 --> 01:23.067
Look, whoever's out there,
this isn't funny, okay?

01:23.134 --> 01:27.604
I'm lost and out of my element
and I get scared easily.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.807
I'm trying to find my friends,

01:30.875 --> 01:32.944
my friends that are Navy SEALs.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.047
They have trained experience

01:36.113 --> 01:40.084
with kahrv magah or
however the fuck you say it

01:40.151 --> 01:42.753
and they're expecting me,

01:43.955 --> 01:45.756
so don't try any shit.

01:47.892 --> 01:49.026
'Cause they're gonna find me.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.131
Pull it together, Jennifer.

02:03.007 --> 02:03.908
No!

02:05.877 --> 02:07.011
No, no, no FUCK

02:07.078 --> 02:09.378
No, no, no, no, oh my god! FUCK!

02:10.914 --> 02:11.816
Oh my god!

02:13.084 --> 02:13.985
Oh my god!

02:17.822 --> 02:18.722
The party.

02:19.757 --> 02:21.125
Everyone's waiting.

02:22.193 --> 02:24.561
I don't think I'm gonna make it

02:24.628 --> 02:25.930
to the party.

02:25.997 --> 02:28.966
Here's another
classic American jam for you.

03:10.207 --> 03:12.076
Happy Fourth of
July, mother fuckers.

03:15.980 --> 03:17.580
Too Cold.

03:18.983 --> 03:20.617
Marcus, it's
too cold in here.

03:20.684 --> 03:21.953
Okay,
it's cold in here

03:22.019 --> 03:23.888
but it's like 100
degrees outside.

03:23.955 --> 03:25.756
Would you guys rather freeze
to death or burn to death?

03:25.823 --> 03:27.724
If I say burn to death,
will you turn the AC down?

03:27.792 --> 03:29.693
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

03:31.929 --> 03:34.664
Whoa, shoot, I think
the car's stuck.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.135
Okay, can we at least
get some fresh air?

03:40.237 --> 03:42.773
I already feel
the sweat coming on.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.775
- Ooh.
- Get away from me.

03:46.243 --> 03:47.744
All right, I should
probably go check the tire.

03:52.817 --> 03:55.152
Oh my gosh, did you see
this photo Nate just posted?

03:55.219 --> 03:58.022
Yeah, "Guns out, fun's out."

03:59.023 --> 04:00.657
He's such an idiot.

04:00.724 --> 04:02.726
Hey, come on now,
he's your brother.

04:02.793 --> 04:04.261
Half-brother,
he's your boyfriend.

04:05.763 --> 04:07.098
I thought you were doing better?

04:07.164 --> 04:10.901
Yeah, I mean it's
not bad, it's just not-

04:10.968 --> 04:14.105
- Great, I think the tires
are stuck on both sides.

04:16.107 --> 04:19.777
Let me check the tail light.

04:20.878 --> 04:22.146
The tail light?

04:23.781 --> 04:25.648
Look, I shouldn't
have said anything.

04:25.715 --> 04:27.852
Nate promised me that he
was gonna behave tonight.

04:27.918 --> 04:29.220
So we're just gonna have fun.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.722
Right Angela, fun?

04:34.258 --> 04:35.860
Look at the comments
on Nate's picture.

04:35.926 --> 04:37.028
People are even stupider than-

04:37.094 --> 04:39.864
- I thought we agreed
no phones on this trip?

04:39.930 --> 04:41.232
- No, we didn't.
- No.

04:41.298 --> 04:42.299
- We didn't?
- No.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.736
Oh god, well then who did
I make that agreement with?

04:46.804 --> 04:47.537
I don't know.

04:50.074 --> 04:51.175
That's weird.

04:51.242 --> 04:52.910
Okay anyways, listen,

04:55.312 --> 04:56.914
let me check under the car.

04:58.249 --> 05:00.151
Okay, so what's the plan?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.685
A couple of drinks
or college drunk?

05:02.753 --> 05:05.056
Ooh, college drunk.

05:05.122 --> 05:06.257
All right.

05:06.323 --> 05:08.125
All right.

05:08.192 --> 05:10.861
All right chitters,
enough chatting or whatever.

05:10.928 --> 05:12.029
Let's give this thing a shot.

05:12.096 --> 05:13.998
I'm gonna go ahead and
step on the gas here.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.900
Angela, you use your
little hand and go

05:15.966 --> 05:18.202
from blue to red on the AC
thing there or whatever.

05:18.269 --> 05:19.303
Mary-

05:19.370 --> 05:20.771
- Okay, why don't I just get out

05:20.838 --> 05:22.239
and push while you rev the gas?

05:23.841 --> 05:24.942
I hadn't thought of that.

05:25.009 --> 05:27.178
See, that's why they
pay you the big bucks.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.979
I know.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.916
Up, up and away.

05:33.851 --> 05:35.252
Down, down, down, shit.

05:37.354 --> 05:38.989
Putting all the
meats, all the meats

05:39.056 --> 05:41.058
into the freezer for my friends.

05:50.968 --> 05:51.869
Good job, Nate.

05:53.838 --> 05:56.107
Ow, damn, that smarts.

06:01.112 --> 06:02.012
Well now,

06:03.080 --> 06:07.952
this party just went
from 10 to 1776.

06:27.204 --> 06:28.372
Spooky.

06:28.439 --> 06:29.340
Marcus.

06:31.175 --> 06:33.244
This place is a lot
creepier than I remember.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.946
What's so creepy
about it out here?

06:36.013 --> 06:37.781
Is it the fact that
we're two miles

06:37.848 --> 06:39.183
away from the closest neighbor?

06:40.851 --> 06:41.919
Or what about the fact
that the only road

06:41.986 --> 06:44.654
in and out is a winding
gravelly nightmare?

06:46.056 --> 06:47.391
Or is it that
redneck gas station

06:47.458 --> 06:49.927
attendant that told us
not to come out here?

06:51.195 --> 06:52.963
- Or is it the-
- Hey, uh, Marcus?

06:53.030 --> 06:55.332
Why do you have a small arsenal
in the back of your car?

06:55.399 --> 06:58.135
Oh, Nate wanted me to
bring some fireworks.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.970
Aren't fireworks
illegal out here?

07:00.037 --> 07:02.206
Yeah, because they're
super dangerous.

07:02.273 --> 07:03.274
Yeah.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.809
Illegal, dangerous.

07:05.876 --> 07:07.311
What about dope as fuck?

07:11.949 --> 07:13.250
Okay, fine.

07:13.317 --> 07:16.353
I'll only bring the ones with
labels written in English.

07:16.420 --> 07:17.888
Buzzkill.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.262
Hello?

07:51.155 --> 07:53.190
Yo.

07:53.257 --> 07:56.260
One if by land, two if by sea.

07:56.327 --> 07:58.395
You fuckers are here
to party with me.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.334
I didn't even hear
you guys come in.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.935
You could be getting
murdered up here,

08:05.002 --> 08:06.870
I'd never know the difference.

08:06.937 --> 08:08.105
I guess it's
good that we weren't then.

08:09.206 --> 08:11.175
Babe.

08:11.242 --> 08:14.178
Stop, stop, stop,
the sun's still up.

08:14.245 --> 08:18.148
Hey listen, so I brought
that sexy Uncle Sam costume.

08:18.215 --> 08:20.251
Oh my god, seriously,
you brought that with you?

08:20.317 --> 08:22.286
What? It's
gonna be so hot.

08:22.353 --> 08:25.022
You're gonna be hot,
babe, you are so hot.

08:26.323 --> 08:28.459
Oh my god, stop
it, you're being gross.

08:28.525 --> 08:30.961
I'm not doing that shit while
Ange and everybody are here.

08:31.028 --> 08:32.996
Oh come on,
it's the Fourth of July.

08:33.063 --> 08:35.366
It only comes around once
a year, please, please?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.001
- No.
- I want you.

08:39.035 --> 08:41.138
We're not doing the sexy
Uncle Sam again, okay?

08:41.205 --> 08:43.173
- It's weird that you like that.
- Hey Nate.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.210
Hey Nate, you have any where
I can plug in my air purifier?

08:46.277 --> 08:48.112
I have allergies, you know.

08:48.178 --> 08:51.081
Yeah bro, plug it into
that power strip over there.

08:51.148 --> 08:52.383
- All right.
- Yeah.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.384
Knucks.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.218
Careful of the beer.

09:01.392 --> 09:04.528
Hey Mary, you want to give
me a hand outside real quick?

09:04.595 --> 09:05.462
Yeah, sure.

09:18.442 --> 09:22.980
Nate, I understand what
you've done with the place.

09:23.047 --> 09:24.348
Yeah, yeah.

09:24.415 --> 09:26.250
Thanks, thanks.

09:26.317 --> 09:27.318
Yeah.

09:27.384 --> 09:28.952
- Red, white.
- Blue.

09:29.019 --> 09:30.988
- Blue.
- Yeah, it's fitting.

09:31.055 --> 09:32.523
Yeah, I thought
so, I thought so.

09:34.491 --> 09:38.195
Hey, I got the food
for you, by the way.

09:38.262 --> 09:41.265
I tried to get the stuff that
your mom used to make for us.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.300
Yeah, it's
an honest effort.

09:46.236 --> 09:49.440
Well hey, thanks
for coming back.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.541
Yeah, of course.

09:50.607 --> 09:52.142
No, I wouldn't want to miss it.

09:53.110 --> 09:53.977
Cool, good.

09:54.044 --> 09:55.079
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:55.145 --> 09:58.982
And thank you too, by the way.

09:59.049 --> 10:01.285
Oh, for what?

10:01.352 --> 10:02.519
For thanking me.

10:04.088 --> 10:05.422
- Right.
- Yeah.

10:05.489 --> 10:07.424
- Yeah, don't mention it.
- Cool.

10:10.661 --> 10:13.364
Hey Nate, what happened
to all your tires?

10:13.430 --> 10:15.199
- They're like shredded.
- Oh yeah.

10:15.265 --> 10:17.601
That winding gravelly nightmare
road really tore 'em up.

10:17.668 --> 10:19.269
It's definitely worse
since last time.

10:19.336 --> 10:21.271
How are you gonna get home?

10:21.338 --> 10:23.607
That sounds like a
problem for future Nate.

10:23.674 --> 10:25.609
That's right,
oh, coming in hot.

10:25.676 --> 10:28.212
- Look at that, it's a snail.
- That's cool.

10:29.279 --> 10:31.081
You pussies gotta catch up.

10:33.384 --> 10:36.453
Hey babe, did you invite
that girl, what's her nuts?

10:36.520 --> 10:38.255
Juanita, Jamilla?

10:38.322 --> 10:39.390
Jennifer?

10:39.456 --> 10:41.291
Arguably the most
common name in America.

10:44.161 --> 10:45.496
She picked up a shift at work.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.431
She'll be here
after she gets off.

10:47.498 --> 10:49.099
Oh, that's awesome, I didn't
think she was gonna make it.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.467
Oh fuck yes,
Jennifer's the best.

10:50.534 --> 10:52.236
I know, right?
She's hilarious.

10:52.302 --> 10:54.138
That bit that she does when

10:54.204 --> 10:55.105
she acts like a cowboy and
she's like "Yippie-ki-yay!"

10:56.273 --> 10:59.076
"I've got a boot in
my snake," or whatever.

10:59.143 --> 11:01.645
Yeah, oh Jennifer.

11:01.712 --> 11:03.647
She's always the
life of the party.

11:03.714 --> 11:04.615
Yeah.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.456
Hey Nate, what
kind of beer is this?

11:12.523 --> 11:14.591
This is American Bohemian,

11:14.658 --> 11:17.361
the official beer of patriotism.

11:19.196 --> 11:22.332
That's weird, the first
ingredient listed is Americana.

11:22.399 --> 11:23.667
I mean, I guess that's more

11:23.734 --> 11:26.069
of an idea than a
tangible ingredient.

11:26.136 --> 11:28.138
Oh yeah, well you're
just mad because it's not

11:28.205 --> 11:32.209
your bullshit pretentious
hipster single malt home-brewed

11:32.276 --> 11:36.280
hamster-picked apple ginger
kombucha buttplug NPR beer.

11:36.346 --> 11:38.649
Okay guys, we're here to have

11:38.715 --> 11:40.317
a good time just
like we used to.

11:40.384 --> 11:41.652
Yeah, a good time.

11:41.718 --> 11:43.153
Remember Spring
Break four years ago?

11:43.220 --> 11:44.321
- Mm hmm.
- Yeah,

11:44.388 --> 11:45.689
and Summer Break four years ago.

11:45.757 --> 11:47.357
And Winter Break
four years ago.

11:47.424 --> 11:48.692
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.427
- And then-
- All right, yeah, we get it.

11:50.494 --> 11:51.295
We had a good time
four years ago.

11:51.361 --> 11:52.162
Yeah, I just,

11:53.464 --> 11:55.632
I just want to have
a good time, woo.

11:55.699 --> 11:58.402
Oh yeah, that's the spirit.

11:58.469 --> 12:01.104
Well, Evan is
gonna be here soon.

12:01.171 --> 12:02.372
Shut up, Evan's coming?

12:03.674 --> 12:05.542
He didn't respond
to my text-vitation.

12:05.609 --> 12:06.710
Well, he texted me.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.581
What?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.583
I guess you guys
just drifted apart.

12:14.184 --> 12:16.687
Yeah, drifted apart? Bullshit.

12:16.754 --> 12:19.490
Beta Beta Betas never drift
apart from your Beta bro

12:19.556 --> 12:22.726
'cause Beta bros have
the best bonds, baby.

12:24.595 --> 12:28.265
Babe, why don't you help me
take my bags upstairs, okay?

12:28.332 --> 12:30.200
Yeah okay, sure.

12:30.267 --> 12:31.001
Yeah.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.605
Oh Nate,
those are my bags.

12:41.545 --> 12:42.613
I'm trying, okay?

12:42.679 --> 12:43.714
You saw me trying, right?

12:44.648 --> 12:46.250
Ah.

12:46.316 --> 12:48.619
Let me get you a towel, Jesus.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.553
Why?

13:19.583 --> 13:20.450
Ooh.

13:21.451 --> 13:22.452
Oh yeah.

13:23.687 --> 13:24.756
It's party time.

13:27.324 --> 13:29.393
I just think that if every
other country in the world

13:29.459 --> 13:33.263
was a person, that America
would be this jacked up cage

13:33.330 --> 13:36.066
fighter who can kick any other
country's ass in a fight.

13:37.467 --> 13:38.602
Listen Nate, I
appreciate your insight.

13:38.669 --> 13:41.305
I really do but have you
taken into consideration

13:41.371 --> 13:44.241
the countries who've existed
far longer than the US?

13:44.308 --> 13:45.777
You don't really have to.

13:45.843 --> 13:47.644
I'm talking about the
countries who've experienced

13:47.711 --> 13:51.748
worse hardships because
arguably those countries would

13:51.816 --> 13:54.786
be more hardened and thus,
more powerful in a fight.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.090
Just throw the damn ball.

14:01.658 --> 14:02.559
All right.

14:06.764 --> 14:07.664
Over here, Ange.

14:08.599 --> 14:09.633
Celeb shot.

14:11.401 --> 14:12.804
Oh yeah.

14:12.870 --> 14:14.738
Bullshit, that doesn't count.

14:16.740 --> 14:18.542
That's what I'm talking about.

14:18.609 --> 14:19.643
Nah, bullshit, bullshit,
that doesn't count.

14:23.347 --> 14:23.881
Hey.

14:25.382 --> 14:26.617
Hello there.

14:26.683 --> 14:28.251
Bonjour.

14:28.318 --> 14:28.853
Salaam.

14:30.654 --> 14:32.589
Mary, Mary, Marky Mark.

14:32.656 --> 14:33.724
- Evan.
- What's up, guys?

14:33.791 --> 14:34.725
I'm so much stronger now.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.360
Yeah.

14:36.426 --> 14:37.594
Jeez, what's up with that?

14:37.661 --> 14:39.429
Hey, what's up Ev?

14:39.496 --> 14:41.632
Hey Nate, it's
good so see you, man.

14:41.698 --> 14:43.600
- Yep.
- Come here, dude.

14:44.902 --> 14:46.104
Beta bros.

14:46.871 --> 14:48.505
Yeah come on, Beta bros.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.742
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Do it, Beta bros!

14:51.809 --> 14:53.811
Come on dude, Beta bros

14:54.946 --> 14:55.847
or bust.

14:58.415 --> 14:59.884
- Yeah, dude.
- That was fun times, man.

14:59.951 --> 15:00.852
For sure.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.521
Well hey, I'll get you a beer.

15:04.588 --> 15:05.622
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:05.689 --> 15:06.556
Thank you.

15:11.595 --> 15:13.497
Where's Jennifer?

15:13.563 --> 15:14.832
Oh, she's coming in a couple
hours, she picked up a shift.

15:14.899 --> 15:16.901
Oh good, I can't
wait to see her.

15:16.968 --> 15:18.836
I mean, no offense to you guys.

15:18.903 --> 15:20.905
She's kinda the
life of the party.

15:20.972 --> 15:22.673
Oh man, I couldn't
agree with you more, Evan.

15:22.739 --> 15:23.440
Definitely.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.643
We suck compared to Jennifer.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.545
What's that bit
she always does?

15:28.612 --> 15:29.746
- Oh, like the cowboy?
- Cowboy, yeah, yeah.

15:29.814 --> 15:30.747
"Yippee-ki-yai."

15:30.815 --> 15:32.649
"Ooh, get a dog, girl"

15:32.716 --> 15:35.652
"Ooh, I've got a boot
in my snake" or whatever.

15:39.423 --> 15:41.391
- What's that?
- What?

15:41.458 --> 15:43.627
There, right behind your ear?

15:45.696 --> 15:47.397
What?

15:47.464 --> 15:47.899
What?

15:47.965 --> 15:48.866
Yes.

15:51.002 --> 15:55.773
Now, let's party
like it's 1776!

15:55.840 --> 15:56.740
Let's do it.

16:12.622 --> 16:15.726
Hey Ange, remember when I said

16:15.793 --> 16:18.528
we should get college drunk?

16:18.595 --> 16:19.563
Vaguely.

16:21.531 --> 16:24.668
Do you two know how many times

16:24.735 --> 16:27.704
I could have busted you
for drinking in your dorm?

16:27.772 --> 16:29.807
Oh what? Yeah right.

16:29.874 --> 16:31.608
Like you would have busted us.

16:31.675 --> 16:34.511
You were drunker than
we were half the time.

16:36.047 --> 16:38.816
Yeah, and you thought
we were too cute to bust.

16:38.883 --> 16:40.417
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

16:40.484 --> 16:41.953
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

16:42.019 --> 16:45.422
- Yeah, is that what it is?
- Stop, I'm so ticklish.

16:45.489 --> 16:47.724
Whatever you say,
you fucking lamppost.

16:47.792 --> 16:52.797
I'm so ticklish, stop.

16:53.530 --> 16:55.398
Stop.

16:55.465 --> 16:57.034
Okay, you pussies
ready for a drinking game?

16:57.969 --> 17:00.004
I see you two, let's go.

17:00.071 --> 17:04.040
♪ Drinking game, drinking game ♪

17:07.078 --> 17:08.612
Yep.

17:08.678 --> 17:09.579
Hey,

17:10.948 --> 17:11.816
Nate,

17:13.650 --> 17:16.788
why don't we take it a
little easy on the drinking?

17:16.854 --> 17:19.790
Come on Evan, you used
to love binge drinking?

17:19.857 --> 17:23.861
Why don't you come sit down
and drink some water with me?

17:23.928 --> 17:25.694
Here we go.

17:25.762 --> 17:28.866
Oh I'm sorry
Ange, what was that?

17:29.834 --> 17:30.935
Listen, man.

17:32.536 --> 17:33.905
Pardon me Evan,

17:33.971 --> 17:35.472
I'm just having a conversation
with my sister real quick.

17:35.539 --> 17:36.908
All right, half-sister.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.642
Look, I'm just saying,

17:38.708 --> 17:41.611
I think you had a
little too much tonight.

17:41.678 --> 17:43.881
Look, you will tell me

17:45.783 --> 17:46.884
when I've had too much.

17:49.553 --> 17:50.087
I just did.

17:51.756 --> 17:52.656
Wait a minute.

17:54.524 --> 17:56.928
Come on, man, we all want
to have a good Fourth but

17:56.994 --> 18:00.998
we don't have to give ourselves
fucking alcohol poisoning.

18:01.065 --> 18:02.800
Shut up.

18:02.867 --> 18:05.069
Don't tell me how to
celebrate America's birthday.

18:05.136 --> 18:06.804
I am a patriot.

18:06.871 --> 18:08.973
You didn't even vote
in the last election.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.707
Okay, I forgot
when the election was.

18:10.775 --> 18:12.509
You had an election day party.

18:12.576 --> 18:13.610
That's highly unlikely.

18:13.677 --> 18:15.545
You made up a hashtag for it.

18:15.612 --> 18:18.783
"Hashtag Nate Harmon's
election day party BYOB

18:18.850 --> 18:21.618
show up at 4:00 one
guest only please."

18:21.685 --> 18:24.055
Okay Nate, I just
think you're being-

18:24.121 --> 18:26.489
- What, oh, you think?

18:26.556 --> 18:28.525
That seems to be the only
thing you can do, Angela.

18:28.592 --> 18:30.027
You kinda just think.

18:30.094 --> 18:32.930
Do you think that our
forefathers thought

18:32.997 --> 18:34.799
whenever they were
founding our great country?

18:34.866 --> 18:36.968
What? Yeah,
I think they did.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.668
Oh, wrong.

18:38.735 --> 18:40.872
George Washington
didn't think whenever

18:40.938 --> 18:43.640
he had to fight off the
British and Abe Lincoln

18:43.707 --> 18:47.044
didn't think whenever he
had to fight the South

18:47.111 --> 18:51.082
and Andrew Jackson didn't
think whenever he had to fight

18:54.185 --> 18:55.953
to be on the $20 bill.

18:57.788 --> 19:01.125
Bro, do you even know
who Andrew Jackson was?

19:01.192 --> 19:02.592
Nate, will you
just listen to me?

19:02.659 --> 19:03.794
You're being insane right now.

19:03.861 --> 19:08.799
Angela, can you just
meet me in the middle?

19:10.667 --> 19:12.569
God, you've been shitting on
me ever since you got here.

19:12.636 --> 19:14.839
First it's the beer, then
it's the dirt on the walls.

19:14.906 --> 19:16.908
Then it's "Oh no Nate,
I fell in the toilet.

19:16.974 --> 19:18.608
Can you please keep
the seat down?"

19:18.675 --> 19:20.144
Okay, well this
is my cabin too.

19:20.211 --> 19:22.646
Oh, this land is your land?

19:22.712 --> 19:25.816
No, this land is my
land and I really think

19:25.883 --> 19:28.886
you're kinda ruining
everybody's good time.

19:28.953 --> 19:30.755
I'm ruining
everyone's good time?

19:30.821 --> 19:33.057
You're so unpredictable,
we're all on babysitting duty

19:33.124 --> 19:34.759
making sure you don't
blow your foot off

19:34.825 --> 19:37.194
with a firework or
drink yourself blind.

19:38.863 --> 19:41.564
Angela, you know how
important this day is.

19:41.631 --> 19:44.101
Oh, how important this
day is to little Nathan.

19:44.168 --> 19:46.771
Yeah, I know, we
all fucking know.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.638
It's so important
because you get

19:48.705 --> 19:50.841
to show everyone out
patriotic you are.

19:52.843 --> 19:53.911
Okay.

19:53.978 --> 19:55.046
All right.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.847
You're right, you're right.

19:56.914 --> 19:57.815
I'm sorry.

19:58.983 --> 20:02.652
I'm sorry that I have
a deeper understanding

20:02.719 --> 20:05.923
of this great country
of ours than you do.

20:05.990 --> 20:08.926
You know what, and I'm sorry
that I love America so much.

20:08.993 --> 20:11.028
You don't love
America, you jackass.

20:11.095 --> 20:12.930
You just love being
American because

20:12.997 --> 20:15.032
you think it makes you
better than everyone else.

20:17.701 --> 20:20.071
Wow, that's just really
good Ange, really good.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.872
I think you probably
just figured me out, huh?

20:21.939 --> 20:23.808
Yeah and you
know, dad would be

20:23.874 --> 20:25.876
really disappointed in how
you're acting right now.

20:40.191 --> 20:41.092
Did I win?

20:49.200 --> 20:51.102
Whoa, I didn't
think we'd be able

20:51.168 --> 20:53.471
to hear fireworks from
all the way out here.

20:58.809 --> 21:00.978
Nathan, you did not
go through dad's stuff.

21:02.246 --> 21:05.082
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

21:05.149 --> 21:08.886
that all men are created equal.

21:08.953 --> 21:11.188
That they are endowed
by their Creator

21:13.024 --> 21:16.894
with certain unalienable rights,
that among those are life,

21:16.961 --> 21:19.930
liberty and the
pursuit of happiness."

21:21.232 --> 21:23.000
Okay, cool, are
you really gonna

21:23.067 --> 21:25.770
sit here and read me the
fucking US Constitution?

21:25.836 --> 21:28.738
Ha, nope, it's the
Declaration of Independence.

21:28.806 --> 21:29.907
Mark one point for Nathan.

21:29.974 --> 21:31.708
- Okay, you know what I meant.
- Oh, did I?

21:31.776 --> 21:32.943
Did I know what you meant?

21:38.783 --> 21:40.117
Damn, this thing's pretty long.

21:41.085 --> 21:42.787
Uh-huh, here we go.

21:42.853 --> 21:45.122
"We therefore, the
Representatives of the

21:45.189 --> 21:48.893
United States of America in
General Congress assembled,

21:48.959 --> 21:51.896
appealing to the Supreme
Judge of the world

21:51.962 --> 21:56.967
for the rectitude of our
intentions, do in the name and by

21:58.836 --> 22:00.737
authority of the good people
of these colonies solemnly

22:00.805 --> 22:04.842
publish and declare for the
support of this Declaration

22:06.277 --> 22:09.046
and a firm reliance on the
protection of divine Providence.

22:09.113 --> 22:13.284
We mutually pledge to
each other our lives,

22:13.350 --> 22:16.987
our fortunes and
our sacred honor."

22:18.389 --> 22:20.057
Right there, right
fucking there,

22:20.124 --> 22:21.926
George fucking
Washington signed it.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.726
That's not George Washington.

22:23.794 --> 22:25.229
That's John Hancock, dumbass.

22:33.137 --> 22:35.005
Oh look, there's
George himself.

22:36.874 --> 22:38.175
There, now he fucking did.

22:44.849 --> 22:47.084
Get the fuck away from me.

22:47.151 --> 22:50.020
What in the United States
of fuck is your problem?

22:51.188 --> 22:53.157
Oh my god Ange, are you okay?

22:57.194 --> 22:59.196
Oh my god Ange, are you okay?

22:59.263 --> 23:00.931
Are you okay, are you all right?

23:07.037 --> 23:09.039
I hate you, I
wish you were dead.

23:12.243 --> 23:14.111
Hey Angela, this
beer wasn't cheap.

23:14.178 --> 23:15.212
Yes it was.

23:16.247 --> 23:18.082
Here, how much was it?

23:18.149 --> 23:20.851
Five bucks, huh,
was it five bucks?

23:20.918 --> 23:22.786
Is this is what you want?

23:22.853 --> 23:23.787
Here.

23:23.854 --> 23:24.889
Yeah.

23:24.955 --> 23:26.190
You know, actually, oh look,

23:26.257 --> 23:28.025
it's your good buddy,
Andrew Jackson.

23:34.932 --> 23:36.333
I don't need this.

23:38.002 --> 23:41.005
What I need is an ice
cold American margarita.

23:45.476 --> 23:46.377
Okay.

23:52.249 --> 23:53.951
Jesus Christ.

23:55.419 --> 23:57.421
What the fuck was that?

23:57.488 --> 23:59.190
I thought you said you
were gonna behave tonight?

23:59.256 --> 24:01.125
What was un-behaving
about what I did?

24:01.192 --> 24:03.260
You owe your
sister an apology.

24:03.327 --> 24:06.063
Half-sister and I
don't owe her anything.

24:06.130 --> 24:07.865
I can do what I want,
it's a free countr...

24:07.932 --> 24:09.934
If you say it's a free
country, I swear to God,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.369
I'm breaking up with you
and hooking up with Marcus.

24:14.238 --> 24:18.042
Apologize to her and then go
get the fucking power back on.

24:18.108 --> 24:21.378
Babe, the breaker is
all the way downstairs

24:21.445 --> 24:23.981
and Angela is all
the way upstairs.

24:25.316 --> 24:27.184
What can I do for
you on this floor?

24:27.251 --> 24:30.321
In the dark while I'm
still pissed off, nothing.

24:32.523 --> 24:34.091
You guys are such-

24:34.158 --> 24:35.226
- If you say pussies,
I swear to God,

24:35.292 --> 24:37.995
I'm breaking up with
you and fucking Marcus.

24:41.065 --> 24:43.067
Calm down, you talking tree.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.737
Let's go, guess this is
a job for present Nate.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.041
We'll be back, so
try not to take

24:51.108 --> 24:53.210
Angela's side over
mine while we're gone.

24:53.277 --> 24:55.045
Nate, you're really making me-

24:55.112 --> 24:56.880
- Oh, I'm so
sorry, I can't hear you.

24:56.947 --> 24:57.982
I'm already in the basement.

25:01.218 --> 25:03.287
- So are we gonna have some-
- Marcus, no.

25:10.127 --> 25:13.264
Jesus, is it tomorrow yet?

25:29.079 --> 25:30.381
What the fuck
is all this shit?

25:30.447 --> 25:32.016
He couldn't put it
in his own room?

25:33.484 --> 25:35.252
I can't believe he did
that in front of you guys.

25:35.319 --> 25:37.087
He's such a fucking dick.

25:37.154 --> 25:38.455
Yeah, I know, you're right.

25:38.522 --> 25:40.357
And I know Nate, I
know he's gonna try

25:40.424 --> 25:42.526
to get back at me for ruining
his pathetic little night

25:42.593 --> 25:44.528
and Mary and Marcus
didn't say shit.

25:44.595 --> 25:47.498
They never defend me because
he's the fun party guy.

25:47.564 --> 25:49.967
- Well, it's not funny anymore.
- Ange, Ange.

25:50.034 --> 25:51.568
- We're not 20.
- Ange.

26:01.045 --> 26:03.213
He hung a fucking
American flag in my room.

26:07.351 --> 26:10.454
Here, let me give
you a shoulder massage,

26:11.622 --> 26:12.823
kinda my trademark.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.226
Evan, I'm not really
in the mood for,

26:18.228 --> 26:19.830
it's your trademark?

26:21.298 --> 26:24.535
I'm known far and
wide for my massages.

26:29.239 --> 26:30.374
Oh Evan.

26:32.042 --> 26:35.279
I don't think this is
good timing, you know?

26:35.346 --> 26:38.148
Because I just was
fighting with Nate and-

26:38.215 --> 26:41.418
- Come on, think about
how pissed Nate would be.

26:42.486 --> 26:44.121
Yeah, that would really piss-

26:44.188 --> 26:46.090
- Pisses me off, the
fact that she actually

26:46.156 --> 26:48.392
thinks she's so
much smarter than me

26:48.459 --> 26:52.129
when spoiler alert,
she's actually not.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.164
Really?

26:55.499 --> 26:59.470
Hey, but didn't she graduate
like something cum latte.

26:59.536 --> 27:02.139
Look, any asshole
can make good grades

27:02.206 --> 27:05.109
but I've got smarts
where it counts, ow.

27:06.410 --> 27:08.278
Hey, I know what
you mean, gamer.

27:08.345 --> 27:10.614
You see, people think I'm
dumb 'cause I'm blond but,

27:10.681 --> 27:14.251
well actually I'm dirty blond,
so joke's on them, right?

27:14.318 --> 27:18.055
Exactly, you know, people
underestimate us, Marcus.

27:18.122 --> 27:20.190
But I bet a zombie
apocalypse scenario,

27:20.257 --> 27:21.625
I'd be the one that survives.

27:23.093 --> 27:25.162
- Ooh, beaker box.
- I don't know.

27:25.229 --> 27:27.431
You see, I think Evan
would make it pretty far.

27:31.168 --> 27:33.303
Oh god, my allergies.

27:41.445 --> 27:42.379
What the hell?

27:42.446 --> 27:45.182
Hello Jennifer, hey.

27:45.249 --> 27:49.119
I haven't heard from you yet
and it's kinda freaking me out.

27:49.186 --> 27:51.088
So could you just please give me

27:51.155 --> 27:53.257
a call back when you get this?

27:57.194 --> 27:58.395
Fuck.

27:58.462 --> 28:00.431
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

28:04.468 --> 28:06.537
Nate, can you just
please hurry up?

28:06.603 --> 28:08.338
I don't like being in the dark.

28:10.741 --> 28:12.309
Come on, Jennifer.

28:16.647 --> 28:19.583
Oh, thank God.

28:19.650 --> 28:24.288
Jennifer, Jesus, you scared
me, I didn't even hear you.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.255
Jen?

28:35.767 --> 28:37.201
Holy fucking-

28:37.267 --> 28:38.168
- Shit.

28:40.404 --> 28:41.338
Oh my-

28:41.405 --> 28:43.340
- God.

28:44.708 --> 28:46.710
What the-

28:46.778 --> 28:50.247
- Fuck, I'm sorry,
they're making a lot of noise downstairs.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.582
Is it okay if I?

28:51.648 --> 28:53.750
Yeah, hey, let
me play some music.

28:55.252 --> 28:56.420
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

29:06.697 --> 29:10.000
- It's a little loud.
- I know, sexy right?

29:13.403 --> 29:14.371
Oh yeah, ahh

29:14.438 --> 29:15.472
AHHHHH

29:15.539 --> 29:16.740
Choo!

29:16.808 --> 29:18.475
- You okay, bro?
- Yeah.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.177
I have allergies.

29:22.546 --> 29:24.515
Is that Mary screaming up there?

29:24.581 --> 29:28.151
Yeah, she probably just
wants to get a rise out of me.

29:28.218 --> 29:29.520
It's gonna take a lot of

29:29.586 --> 29:32.489
Sexy Uncle Sam for me
to forgive you, babe.

29:32.556 --> 29:34.491
Hey, can you swing that
flashlight over here?

29:34.558 --> 29:35.425
Yeah.

29:41.732 --> 29:44.434
♪ Bum ba da da da ♪

29:46.236 --> 29:49.706
♪ Bum ba da da da ♪

29:49.774 --> 29:50.775
♪ Bum ba da ♪

29:52.476 --> 29:53.811
I think we should
do something.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.314
Fine but if she's
fucking with us,

29:58.248 --> 29:59.516
you're sleeping outside.

29:59.583 --> 30:01.585
- Oh boy, camping.
- No, no, no.

30:03.287 --> 30:05.422
All right Mary,
you've made your point.

30:07.658 --> 30:08.559
No, no.

30:14.298 --> 30:14.832
Get down.

30:15.767 --> 30:17.568
What's going on, man?

30:17.634 --> 30:19.269
Who is that guy?

30:19.336 --> 30:21.305
Holy shit, that's
George Washington.

30:22.606 --> 30:24.308
Holy shit, that's
George Washington.

30:28.712 --> 30:30.547
That's not George
Washington, man.

30:30.614 --> 30:32.482
That's probably just
some drunk homeless guy

30:32.549 --> 30:35.519
who stumbled in here wearing
George Washington's costume

30:35.586 --> 30:39.523
and started violently attacking
your girlfriend with an ax.

30:45.629 --> 30:47.564
I'm not worried about it.

30:47.631 --> 30:49.299
I've seen her kick bigger
ass-clown's asses than this clown.

30:57.407 --> 30:58.442
Yep, I told you.

30:59.576 --> 31:00.845
He's even wearing zombie makeup.

31:00.912 --> 31:02.646
This guy's clearly
trying to fuck with us.

31:02.713 --> 31:04.348
What a total loser.

31:16.928 --> 31:20.330
Holy George Washington's ghost,

31:20.397 --> 31:21.598
it's George Washington's zombie.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.870
It looks like his corpse
has been like reanimated.

31:25.937 --> 31:27.504
No, he's been

31:31.508 --> 31:32.542
re-elected.

31:38.582 --> 31:40.384
Nate, you should do something.

31:40.450 --> 31:42.319
What am I supposed to do?

31:42.386 --> 31:44.688
He's the first President of
the United States of America.

31:44.756 --> 31:47.424
He's not the President,
man, he's a monster.

31:48.692 --> 31:49.827
He's gonna hurt Mary.

31:55.967 --> 31:58.635
You know, I'm gonna
bow out of this one.

31:58.702 --> 32:00.303
- Leave it to you, good buddy
- Oh no.

32:00.370 --> 32:01.605
I actually haven't
had much to eat today.

32:01.672 --> 32:02.706
My blood sugar's real low.

32:02.774 --> 32:04.909
You had 15 empanadas earlier.

32:04.976 --> 32:07.577
That's bad sugar,
I need good sugar.

32:07.644 --> 32:08.913
Like Splenda or something?

32:08.980 --> 32:10.848
No, Splenda's actually a lot

32:10.915 --> 32:12.649
worse for you than
regular sugar.

32:12.716 --> 32:16.720
- You don't say?
- Oh no, I do, you see...

32:43.647 --> 32:44.882
Goddammit, fuck.

32:46.818 --> 32:50.353
Stupid ass fucking woods.

32:50.420 --> 32:50.955
Fuck.

32:52.422 --> 32:52.957
Shit.

32:55.726 --> 32:56.626
Dammit.

32:57.762 --> 32:58.830
Fuck.

32:58.896 --> 33:00.363
Shit.

33:00.430 --> 33:01.665
Oh my god.

33:11.943 --> 33:14.444
Fuck. Goddammit.

33:25.923 --> 33:27.524
Did she get it?

33:28.793 --> 33:30.694
How the fuck am
I supposed to know?

33:30.762 --> 33:33.463
I was back here hiding with
you, fucking human windmill.

33:33.530 --> 33:36.466
Oh right, hey,
I have feelings.

33:36.533 --> 33:37.068
Oh.

33:38.069 --> 33:39.804
Hey, I'm sorry man.

33:41.705 --> 33:43.607
It's all right, man.

33:47.845 --> 33:48.880
Oh man.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.549
She destroyed a
whole case of beer.

33:53.617 --> 33:54.819
That's 11 bucks down the drain.

33:56.653 --> 33:59.689
It's okay, I stashed a few
house beers around just in case.

34:03.593 --> 34:04.996
Jesus Mary, what happened?

34:05.062 --> 34:05.897
- Are you okay?
- Did you kill the zombie?

34:05.963 --> 34:07.597
Was it epic?

34:08.665 --> 34:09.833
Trash can.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.768
Oh no, no, Marcus.

34:14.571 --> 34:15.273
Here, here.

34:24.748 --> 34:28.018
Hey babe, why
don't you lie down?

34:35.559 --> 34:36.928
What's going on?

34:36.994 --> 34:38.562
Mary, are you okay?

34:38.628 --> 34:39.663
George Washington
was just here.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.565
No, I wasn't talking to you.

34:41.630 --> 34:44.034
Mary, oh my god, what
did you guys do to her?

34:44.101 --> 34:45.735
She just fought a zombie.

34:45.803 --> 34:48.072
All right, you've
all had your fun.

34:48.139 --> 34:52.043
Can you just please
turn the lights back on

34:52.109 --> 34:55.780
so we can try and enjoy
the rest of our night?

34:55.847 --> 34:58.850
Seriously, zombie George
Washington was just here.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.885
Yeah, Mary chased
him off into the woods.

35:00.952 --> 35:02.820
- It was kind of scary.
- It was gross.

35:02.887 --> 35:04.989
- It was pretty cool too.
- Yeah, Mary and the zombie.

35:05.056 --> 35:06.723
Yeah, she's a real badass.

35:06.791 --> 35:08.893
Oh my god, shut
the fuck up, okay?

35:08.960 --> 35:10.761
What, so you're
trying to tell me that

35:10.828 --> 35:13.730
the corpse of the first
President of the United States

35:13.798 --> 35:15.766
came back to life,
dragged itself out

35:15.833 --> 35:17.734
of the ground and then
broke into our cabin?

35:17.802 --> 35:19.636
Right.

35:19.703 --> 35:21.973
And then Mary fought it
and chased it into the woods?

35:22.039 --> 35:23.673
Correct.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.575
And so the zombie is
supposed to be some sort

35:25.642 --> 35:28.145
of lesson about what it
means to truly be a patriot?

35:30.147 --> 35:33.084
I mean, it wouldn't be
the worst thing to happen.

35:33.150 --> 35:35.652
Shut the fuck up,
okay? It's not funny.

35:35.719 --> 35:38.588
God, Mary, you're so
much better than this.

35:38.655 --> 35:39.957
Why are you playing along?

35:41.893 --> 35:43.393
We were attacked.

35:45.196 --> 35:49.800
I know that sounds crazy
but that thing wasn't human.

35:54.005 --> 35:57.008
Whoever attacked
you was probably

35:57.074 --> 36:01.745
homeless or on drugs,
sick or something, okay?

36:01.812 --> 36:04.115
There has to be some sort
of rational explanation.

36:05.715 --> 36:07.018
What's irrational
about zombies?

36:07.084 --> 36:08.685
We gotta go somewhere
when we die.

36:08.753 --> 36:10.788
We're not talking
about zombies.

36:10.855 --> 36:12.722
Well, I'm talking
about zombies.

36:12.790 --> 36:14.792
Yeah, he's been talking
about zombies all night.

36:14.859 --> 36:17.094
That's what I'm saying,
you're just being paranoid.

36:17.161 --> 36:18.930
We were attacked.

36:18.996 --> 36:20.630
So let's call the cops.

36:20.697 --> 36:23.034
Cops can't do anything
about that monster.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.903
Ange, it killed Jennifer, I saw

36:26.804 --> 36:28.172
her body.

36:28.239 --> 36:32.575
Oh my god, her body,
where's her body?

36:32.642 --> 36:33.177
Mar,

36:34.879 --> 36:36.881
I'm sure she's okay, okay?

36:38.149 --> 36:39.749
You're just shaken
up, it's okay.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.619
How about this?

36:42.686 --> 36:45.655
We'll go outside and look for
the creep that attacked you.

36:45.722 --> 36:48.658
You guys stay back
and call the police.

36:51.162 --> 36:56.167
There's a bunch of us
and what, one old dude?

36:57.835 --> 36:58.903
I think
that's a great idea.

36:58.970 --> 37:00.771
Cool, Angela and I
will go into the woods.

37:00.838 --> 37:02.139
You guys stay back
and wait for the cops.

37:02.206 --> 37:04.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa
there, lover boy.

37:04.942 --> 37:08.079
Are you trying to say that I
can't protect my baby sister

37:08.145 --> 37:10.214
and my crying girlfriend
and my tall buddy, Marcus?

37:10.281 --> 37:12.016
No, I'm not
saying that at all.

37:13.851 --> 37:15.719
But I'm definitely thinking
it now, so thank you.

37:15.786 --> 37:18.823
I could protect everyone in
circles around you, jerk-off.

37:20.758 --> 37:22.659
Marcus, you take care of Mary.

37:22.726 --> 37:24.895
Yeah, I think splitting up
is definitely the way to go.

37:24.962 --> 37:27.630
No wait, guys, guys,
please don't leave me.

37:27.697 --> 37:29.867
No Mar, we won't
leave you, don't worry.

37:29.934 --> 37:32.702
Don't worry babe,
I'll never leave you

37:34.905 --> 37:36.240
- aside from right now.
- What?

37:37.875 --> 37:39.043
But I will be
here the whole time.

37:45.182 --> 37:48.819
Pretend I'm this eagle
protecting America

37:50.254 --> 37:51.055
and pretend you're
America in this scenario.

37:52.957 --> 37:53.858
What?

37:56.927 --> 37:59.230
Let's go impeach
that mother fucker.

37:59.296 --> 38:00.197
What?

38:02.066 --> 38:02.967
Impeach.

38:03.834 --> 38:05.870
You know, like kick his ass but

38:05.936 --> 38:09.106
he's the first President of
the United States, so impeach.

38:09.173 --> 38:11.008
I thought it sounded
kinda badass.

38:11.075 --> 38:12.009
It didn't.

38:12.076 --> 38:13.743
It kinda did.

38:13.811 --> 38:15.079
No, you can't
just add the word

38:15.146 --> 38:17.547
mother fucker to things and
expect it to sound badass.

38:18.949 --> 38:19.850
Shut up.

38:21.852 --> 38:23.788
Let's go into those woods.

38:25.089 --> 38:26.957
Let's get out of these woods.

38:27.024 --> 38:29.293
Oh no, Nate's scared,
we better turn around.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.928
I'm not scared.

38:30.995 --> 38:32.296
Yes you are.

38:32.363 --> 38:34.165
Why is that so hard
for you to admit?

38:34.231 --> 38:35.299
Ang, I'm starting to
think we should head back.

38:35.366 --> 38:37.168
See, Evan's scared too.

38:37.234 --> 38:38.903
Yeah, but I haven't been
crying for the last half hour.

38:38.969 --> 38:40.805
I was not crying.

38:40.871 --> 38:42.840
I told you I think there are
onions growing in these woods.

38:42.907 --> 38:45.910
Shh, I think I
heard something.

38:45.976 --> 38:48.979
Yeah, I'm sure you did,
we're in the fucking woods.

38:50.014 --> 38:51.714
Yo, Ange.

38:51.782 --> 38:53.050
No, you know what?

38:53.117 --> 38:54.151
We've been pointing
our flashlights

38:54.218 --> 38:55.319
at trees for the last hour.

38:55.386 --> 38:57.788
You got me, okay?

38:57.855 --> 39:01.792
I know that this is some
sort of elaborate joke,

39:01.859 --> 39:03.994
kind of like the
Electoral College.

39:05.296 --> 39:07.098
Come on, I thought
you'd like that one.

39:09.967 --> 39:11.302
What is it?

39:11.368 --> 39:13.170
Zombie.

39:13.237 --> 39:15.072
And let me guess, this
one's Abraham Lincoln, right?

39:15.139 --> 39:16.606
Beard, top hat and all?

39:20.411 --> 39:23.080
And he's coming up
right behind me.

39:23.147 --> 39:25.816
He has a knife or
an ax or something

39:25.883 --> 39:27.985
and he's gonna say
something really stupid

39:28.052 --> 39:32.056
and obvious like "Four
score and seven years ago."

39:33.023 --> 39:34.258
Four

39:34.325 --> 39:35.926
score.

39:37.161 --> 39:38.162
Oh my god.

39:39.163 --> 39:40.364
No way.

39:40.431 --> 39:41.932
Four

39:41.999 --> 39:42.900
score.

39:43.834 --> 39:46.270
No way, that's
Abraham Lincoln.

39:46.337 --> 39:47.838
And that's...

39:54.044 --> 39:55.712
I don't know who that is.

39:55.779 --> 39:58.015
- That's Andrew Jackson.
- Who?

39:58.082 --> 40:01.785
- The guy on the 20.
- Oh, I love him.

40:01.852 --> 40:03.154
This doesn't make any sense.

40:04.388 --> 40:06.891
It all has a logic to it

40:06.957 --> 40:08.058
if you just

40:08.125 --> 40:09.026
understand.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.829
Four score,

40:11.896 --> 40:13.230
four score,

40:13.297 --> 40:14.965
four score,

40:15.032 --> 40:15.799
four score.

40:19.937 --> 40:21.172
What are you doing?

40:21.238 --> 40:23.140
Sorry bro, catch up.

40:31.882 --> 40:34.818
Mr. President, sir,
let's settle this

40:34.885 --> 40:37.188
in a sophisticated,
dignified, patriotic manner?

40:47.164 --> 40:49.867
Now Andy, Andy,
that wasn't cool.

40:51.235 --> 40:53.304
Come on, you were always
my favorite President.

40:55.105 --> 40:57.141
President?

40:57.208 --> 40:58.108
Right.

41:00.211 --> 41:02.880
The leader of the free
world, Commander-in-Chief.

41:03.847 --> 41:04.348
Mm-mm-

41:04.415 --> 41:06.984
Mander Chief?

41:07.051 --> 41:07.952
Exactly.

41:12.323 --> 41:14.925
Hello Nathaniel, yes it's me,

41:14.992 --> 41:17.861
your favorite President,
Andrew Jackson,

41:17.928 --> 41:19.897
the man that's on the $20 bill.

41:19.964 --> 41:20.931
I need you.

41:22.166 --> 41:26.203
Come on Andy, let's
settle this diplomatically.

41:48.359 --> 41:50.127
We need to go back for him.

41:50.194 --> 41:51.428
We need to go back for him now.

41:51.495 --> 41:53.130
- We do not.
- Now, yes we do.

41:53.197 --> 41:55.966
We need to stay
here for the night.

41:56.033 --> 41:57.067
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

41:57.134 --> 41:58.502
I'm trying to protect us.

42:00.204 --> 42:02.139
- He's dead weight.
- He's my brother.

42:02.206 --> 42:03.107
Half-brother.

42:04.375 --> 42:06.410
You said you wished he was dead.

42:06.477 --> 42:08.212
This isn't about me, okay?

42:08.279 --> 42:09.913
You never liked Nate.

42:09.980 --> 42:13.117
I'm not about to
let him get us killed.

42:21.258 --> 42:22.926
Nate and I used to play

42:22.993 --> 42:24.328
in this barn together
when we were little.

42:24.395 --> 42:25.996
No, no, Angela.

42:27.031 --> 42:29.066
We don't have time for this.

42:30.401 --> 42:32.102
From the second I
got here tonight,

42:32.169 --> 42:35.306
you've been saying how
much you hate Nate.

42:35.372 --> 42:38.409
I know you feel some
sort of obligation

42:38.475 --> 42:41.879
to him but he would
have done exactly

42:41.945 --> 42:44.214
the same thing to us if
he had had the chance.

42:45.549 --> 42:47.418
How can you say that?

42:47.484 --> 42:50.421
I can say that because
I know who Nate is

42:52.089 --> 42:55.025
and deep down, you
know who he is too.

42:57.127 --> 43:00.297
This situation
really sucks, it does

43:01.965 --> 43:04.301
but I can protect you,
we can survive together.

43:04.368 --> 43:06.170
I don't need
you to protect me.

43:08.505 --> 43:11.975
Fine, you can protect me.

43:12.042 --> 43:13.310
Semantics, whatever.

43:14.411 --> 43:15.312
Angela,

43:16.580 --> 43:18.482
please trust me.

43:25.155 --> 43:26.523
♪ Sweet ♪

43:26.590 --> 43:27.458
Okay,

43:29.093 --> 43:30.094
I trust you.

43:31.028 --> 43:32.596
♪ Girl ♪

44:05.028 --> 44:07.231
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Angela,
it's just me, it's just me.

44:07.297 --> 44:09.099
Chill out, chill out.

44:09.166 --> 44:11.235
- Oh gross, is that blood?
- Evan.

44:12.369 --> 44:13.504
- What?
- Evan.

44:15.439 --> 44:17.441
I just watched him die.

44:17.508 --> 44:22.112
Oh my god, oh my god,
hey, hey, come here.

44:23.147 --> 44:25.215
- Oh my god.
- I'm so sorry.

44:26.483 --> 44:29.386
I'm so sorry, I didn't
want to leave you.

44:29.453 --> 44:30.354
No.

44:32.189 --> 44:35.592
Hey, let's just say, uh,
don't worry about it, okay?

44:35.659 --> 44:37.494
- Okay.
- All right?

44:37.561 --> 44:41.198
Hey, come on, let's
get to the cabin, yeah?

44:41.265 --> 44:42.466
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:42.533 --> 44:44.401
Wait, what
happened to Jackson?

44:44.468 --> 44:48.439
Let's just say we won't
have to worry about him.

44:52.109 --> 44:53.477
I thought you said we don't
have to worry about Jackson.

44:53.544 --> 44:56.346
I said "Lets say we wouldn't
have to worry about Jackson."

44:56.413 --> 44:58.515
I don't know, it seemed
like the right thing to say.

45:04.388 --> 45:06.023
Okay, what now?

45:06.089 --> 45:07.224
I think we're lost.

45:07.291 --> 45:09.626
You'd better be joking.

45:09.693 --> 45:11.328
No, I really don't
know where the cabin is.

45:11.395 --> 45:13.263
Well, it should
just be over there.

45:13.330 --> 45:15.299
Well, it should be but,
wait, hold on one second.

45:16.567 --> 45:18.235
Okay yeah, here we go.

45:18.302 --> 45:19.336
So if trees grow
towards the north

45:19.403 --> 45:22.239
and moss grows fat
on the rolling stone,

45:22.306 --> 45:23.507
then the cabin should be...

45:25.542 --> 45:27.244
Ow.

45:27.311 --> 45:28.512
- Let me look at it.
- No stop, get off.

45:28.579 --> 45:30.514
This is my replacement phone.

45:30.581 --> 45:32.616
It's very susceptible to
being broken by rocks.

45:33.717 --> 45:35.552
Mary.

45:35.619 --> 45:37.387
- Let me talk to her.
- No, let me talk to her.

45:37.454 --> 45:39.122
- She's my girlfriend.
- No, she's my best friend.

45:39.189 --> 45:40.290
- I've known her longer.
- I've known her longer.

45:40.357 --> 45:41.258
- Have you kissed her?
- Yes.

45:41.325 --> 45:44.194
- What?
- What?

45:45.295 --> 45:46.730
- Nate, are you there?
- Ow.

45:48.198 --> 45:50.300
Ange, oh my god, are you okay?

45:51.735 --> 45:53.403
Nate,

45:53.470 --> 45:54.371
Ange?

45:56.373 --> 45:58.141
Hello?

46:04.481 --> 46:05.349
Marcus.

46:07.551 --> 46:09.386
I think it got Nate and Ange.

46:10.454 --> 46:12.289
What about Evan?

46:12.356 --> 46:15.158
I tried calling but it
went straight to voicemail.

46:15.225 --> 46:17.261
Oh Evan, that's who I made

46:17.327 --> 46:19.296
the no phones on this
trip agreement with.

46:19.363 --> 46:23.300
Marcus, it could just
be us out here now.

46:23.367 --> 46:25.702
Dammit, Nate thought
he'd be the last

46:25.770 --> 46:28.572
one alive during a zombie
apocalypse scenario.

46:28.639 --> 46:30.307
He's gonna be so disappointed.

46:31.508 --> 46:33.310
- Oh my god.
- Hey.

46:33.377 --> 46:35.445
Hey, stop all that, come on.

46:35.512 --> 46:37.314
It's gonna be okay.

46:37.381 --> 46:39.550
- Oh my god.
- It's gonna be all right.

46:39.616 --> 46:41.718
Hey, hey.

46:43.387 --> 46:44.254
Marcus.

46:46.323 --> 46:48.625
Maybe we should call the police.

46:48.692 --> 46:51.194
Yeah right, the police,
let's call the police.

46:52.496 --> 46:53.397
What's the number
for the police?

46:53.463 --> 46:55.165
Seriously?

46:55.232 --> 46:57.200
I'm just kidding, I'm
not that fucking stupid.

46:57.267 --> 46:58.268
Oh my god.

46:59.670 --> 47:02.205
1-800-Police...

47:02.272 --> 47:04.207
It's 911 Marcus, 911.

47:04.274 --> 47:05.342
Right, right.

47:07.812 --> 47:08.745
911,
what's your emergency?

47:08.813 --> 47:12.182
Hi, well, we, I-

47:12.249 --> 47:13.750
- Hello, sir?

47:13.818 --> 47:16.219
Zombies, there's zombies
here, you gotta save us.

47:16.286 --> 47:18.488
Sir, this line
is for emergencies only.

47:18.555 --> 47:20.357
This is an emergency.

47:20.424 --> 47:22.392
We're at a cabin in
the woods off I-15.

47:26.663 --> 47:28.365
Oh my god, they're
gonna get her.

47:28.432 --> 47:29.767
Oh no, please don't get me.

47:29.834 --> 47:31.668
Oh, they're getting her.

47:31.735 --> 47:33.604
Oh my god,

47:33.670 --> 47:35.439
they're dismembering her
body right in front of me.

47:35.505 --> 47:37.641
Oh no, I don't want
to die, Marcus.

47:37.708 --> 47:40.577
I won't let you die,
baby, it's gonna be okay.

47:40.644 --> 47:42.346
Oh my god.

47:44.648 --> 47:47.317
Jesus Christ, they ate her,
they just fuckin' ate her.

47:47.384 --> 47:50.320
Sir, sir,
you do realize it's

47:50.387 --> 47:53.457
a Federal offense to prank
call emergency services, right?

47:54.424 --> 47:56.393
Well,

47:56.460 --> 47:59.262
well yeah, thanks, bye.

48:00.664 --> 48:02.566
There, they should
be here in no time.

48:04.601 --> 48:06.303
Oh my god.

48:06.370 --> 48:07.671
What?

48:07.738 --> 48:09.406
- Oh my god.
- Hey, come on, take it easy.

48:09.473 --> 48:12.643
Hey, listen, we'll
get the power back on,

48:12.709 --> 48:16.279
get the AC blowing,
microwave us some taquitos.

48:16.346 --> 48:17.681
Maybe get some sexy
music going on.

48:17.748 --> 48:19.516
The AC.

48:19.583 --> 48:20.484
Marcus,

48:21.718 --> 48:23.687
the AC, it was
blowing in your car

48:23.755 --> 48:25.622
and it seemed to
hurt Washington.

48:25.689 --> 48:27.391
Maybe we'll be safe in your
car and we can make a getaway.

48:27.457 --> 48:29.292
Yeah, great,
let's get in my car.

48:29.359 --> 48:32.830
Wait, it died when I
was out there before.

48:32.897 --> 48:34.297
What about Nate's car?

48:34.364 --> 48:35.465
The tires are shredded.

48:36.400 --> 48:37.701
What about Evan's?

48:37.769 --> 48:38.836
I think he took
the keys with him.

48:39.871 --> 48:41.738
Can you hot-wire it?

48:41.806 --> 48:43.440
What do I look
like, Hotty McWire?

48:43.507 --> 48:44.809
What?

48:44.876 --> 48:46.710
It's fine, we'll
pop open the hood

48:46.778 --> 48:49.346
of my car and get that
bad boy going in no time.

48:49.413 --> 48:50.782
I've seen a car two before.

48:51.816 --> 48:53.350
But what about Washington?

49:00.590 --> 49:02.827
I think I've got an idea.

49:05.429 --> 49:06.329
I want you

49:08.465 --> 49:11.468
to stay away from us
and to not eat us.

49:13.370 --> 49:15.873
Marcus, this is the dumbest
idea you've ever come up with.

49:15.940 --> 49:17.741
Join the Army.

49:17.809 --> 49:20.343
You can keep that stupid
costume, by the way.

49:22.780 --> 49:23.680
Okay.

49:24.614 --> 49:25.749
I think it should work.

49:25.817 --> 49:28.318
Here, start the car.

49:37.561 --> 49:38.462
Marcus?

49:39.797 --> 49:41.364
Save yourself.

49:45.535 --> 49:46.536
Remember me.

49:47.471 --> 49:48.705
Marcus, Marcus.

49:49.807 --> 49:51.909
As a hero, not a coward.

49:59.449 --> 49:59.984
Dammit.

50:02.486 --> 50:03.821
Bury me on Halloween.

50:05.455 --> 50:07.691
I want my funeral
to be extra spooky.

50:09.726 --> 50:10.795
Oh, Marcus.

50:12.997 --> 50:14.731
Oh shit.

50:16.868 --> 50:18.602
Chill out, asshole.

50:21.738 --> 50:22.874
Not so cool,

50:24.741 --> 50:25.642
is it?

50:31.715 --> 50:33.550
We'll have a great
Fourth of July, he said.

50:33.617 --> 50:35.352
It'll be fun, he said.

50:35.418 --> 50:36.486
What the fuck.

50:36.553 --> 50:37.889
This is what I get for
dating a white guy.

50:37.955 --> 50:39.623
Who's next, Andrew Jackson?

50:46.898 --> 50:48.900
What the... Angela, you
almost broke my phone.

50:48.966 --> 50:51.903
I told you it's very susceptible
to being broken by rocks.

50:53.470 --> 50:54.772
Oh man.

50:54.839 --> 50:56.673
Well if you would've given
me the GPS 10 minutes ago,

50:56.740 --> 50:58.708
then we wouldn't have
been in this situation.

50:59.643 --> 51:00.978
Now we're even more lost

51:01.045 --> 51:02.847
and we need to get
back to the cabin.

51:02.914 --> 51:06.583
Okay, yes, I agree but I
don't know where the cabin is.

51:06.650 --> 51:08.652
This is so fucking
typical, Nate.

51:10.520 --> 51:12.389
You raise an army of the
living dead but your pride

51:12.455 --> 51:14.658
and stupidity are still the
biggest threats to our safety.

51:14.724 --> 51:18.461
I raised an army
of the living dead?

51:18.528 --> 51:19.997
How sure are we that
this isn't your fault?

51:20.064 --> 51:21.966
My fault?

51:22.033 --> 51:23.667
This all seems like America
trying to teach you a lesson.

51:23.733 --> 51:24.668
What lesson, don't
get killed by zombies?

51:24.734 --> 51:25.903
That's a great lesson.

51:28.538 --> 51:29.606
If you'd only shown this much

51:29.673 --> 51:31.541
initiative when dad got sick.

51:31.608 --> 51:33.610
Oh, come on.

51:33.677 --> 51:36.013
You didn't ask for my
help, so I didn't offer it.

51:36.080 --> 51:38.748
Well, I shouldn't have had
to ask, he was our father.

51:38.816 --> 51:40.684
I honored him in my own way.

51:40.750 --> 51:42.719
You got drunk and broke
into a baseball stadium.

51:42.787 --> 51:44.688
It's what he
would have wanted.

51:52.495 --> 51:57.068
Okay, I'm not sure what
that is but I think we should,

51:58.535 --> 51:59.569
yeah.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.781
Come on Nate, let's go.

52:10.848 --> 52:12.950
Wait a sec, I had a lot of
beers and chalupas tonight.

52:14.919 --> 52:18.555
No seriously, look, the
cabin's right there, come on.

52:25.029 --> 52:27.530
'Mander Chief.

52:29.100 --> 52:30.700
This is all my fault.

52:32.602 --> 52:35.039
Now's not the
best time, Nathan.

52:35.106 --> 52:38.776
Everyone else is dead
and it's all my fault.

52:38.843 --> 52:40.677
You don't know that, okay?

52:40.744 --> 52:43.080
The car's gone, maybe Mary and
Marcus went to go get help.

52:44.916 --> 52:47.617
They'll never make it outta
here and neither will we.

52:47.684 --> 52:48.953
I killed Mary,

52:49.020 --> 52:51.055
I killed Marcus,

52:51.122 --> 52:52.622
I killed us.

52:54.125 --> 52:58.062
If you feel so fucking
bad, come and help me.

53:00.730 --> 53:02.565
That can't be good.

53:02.632 --> 53:04.902
Nate, come on, we gotta
get out of here, come on.

53:04.969 --> 53:07.772
What's the use? I'm no good.

53:09.173 --> 53:11.741
I couldn't be there for
dad when he needed me.

53:13.044 --> 53:15.712
I couldn't protect Mary
from the killer zombies.

53:15.780 --> 53:16.981
I can't protect you.

53:18.615 --> 53:19.884
I don't need
you to protect me.

53:19.951 --> 53:21.618
Right now, you need
me to protect you.

53:24.021 --> 53:25.856
Whatever has happened between us

53:25.923 --> 53:27.892
in the past few years,
it's behind us now, okay?

53:27.959 --> 53:28.960
It doesn't matter.

53:30.828 --> 53:32.863
I need you to get off your
ass and come with me, okay?

53:32.930 --> 53:34.597
We should stick together.

53:38.803 --> 53:39.703
Okay.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.842
A house divided-

53:44.909 --> 53:46.210
- Against itself cannot stand.

53:47.211 --> 53:48.545
Yes.

53:48.611 --> 53:49.146
Come on.

53:50.214 --> 53:51.782
You quoted Lincoln.

53:52.850 --> 53:53.951
I win.

54:37.828 --> 54:39.030
Nate, run.

54:42.767 --> 54:46.871
My compatriot.

54:53.077 --> 54:54.711
Brother.

54:54.779 --> 54:55.279
Please

54:56.746 --> 54:58.149
save your strength.

55:00.017 --> 55:03.254
Enjoy the sweet warmth of
the land of the living.

55:06.157 --> 55:07.158
Washington

55:08.059 --> 55:08.959
looks

55:10.727 --> 55:11.262
human.

55:12.196 --> 55:13.864
Hush, my friend.

55:15.900 --> 55:17.700
Soon enough, you shall too.

55:19.103 --> 55:20.004
Then

55:20.971 --> 55:22.173
when we have our army,

55:23.740 --> 55:25.810
nothing can stop us.

55:28.045 --> 55:30.014
This land

55:30.081 --> 55:31.182
belongs to us.

55:35.853 --> 55:37.888
Are you ready to take it back?

56:03.347 --> 56:05.216
Nate, your tapping your
foot is freaking me out, okay?

56:05.282 --> 56:07.218
Help me board up a
window or something.

56:08.886 --> 56:10.754
Angela, I want to talk
to you about something

56:10.821 --> 56:12.123
and just a warning, it's
going to be controversial.

56:12.189 --> 56:14.325
Everything you say
is controversial, Nate.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.161
I don't think I can
fight off these zombies.

56:17.228 --> 56:18.762
Yeah, I know you can't.

56:18.829 --> 56:20.898
You're not very coordinated.

56:20.965 --> 56:23.968
I mean I don't think I
can bring myself to do it.

56:26.337 --> 56:28.172
What's that supposed to mean?

56:28.239 --> 56:30.174
Look, if this were
a legion of the undead

56:30.241 --> 56:32.309
and they were a bunch of
anonymous Joe Schmoes,

56:32.376 --> 56:34.945
I would have no
problem killing them.

56:35.012 --> 56:39.250
But these, they're former
Presidents of the United States.

56:44.321 --> 56:46.790
Nate, I'm running out
of rousing speeches here.

56:46.857 --> 56:49.059
No Ange, you don't get it.

56:49.126 --> 56:50.127
Washington, Lincoln.

56:51.095 --> 56:53.230
They are America.

56:53.297 --> 56:55.933
I mean shit, Andrew
Jackson is on the $20 bill.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.234
Is that literally
the only thing

56:57.301 --> 56:59.136
you know about Andrew Jackson?

56:59.203 --> 57:01.138
- I know he was a President.
- Yeah, which one?

57:01.205 --> 57:02.106
What number?

57:03.941 --> 57:08.745
I want to say higher than
three but less than 50.

57:08.812 --> 57:13.284
He was the seventh and
he was a piece of shit.

57:13.350 --> 57:15.219
You can't say that
about a President.

57:15.286 --> 57:17.354
Have you heard of
the Trail of Tears?

57:17.421 --> 57:19.023
That was Jackson.

57:19.089 --> 57:20.958
No, I haven't
heard of that and it

57:21.025 --> 57:23.160
doesn't matter what he did,
he was still the President.

57:23.227 --> 57:24.828
Okay, enough Nate.

57:24.895 --> 57:26.764
I'm clearly not gonna
change your mind

57:26.830 --> 57:29.433
but we have to do something,
like get the power back on.

57:31.835 --> 57:34.838
I'm sorry, Ange, but I
really want to stay here.

57:35.973 --> 57:38.275
Please stay here with me.

57:39.910 --> 57:42.146
We can sit and talk, reconnect.

57:43.280 --> 57:45.916
Look, I was wrong.

57:46.850 --> 57:47.885
Okay?

57:47.952 --> 57:51.789
We don't need each
other and at this point,

57:51.855 --> 57:54.925
I either have to leave you

57:54.992 --> 57:56.060
or die with you.

58:01.165 --> 58:06.036
You know why the Fourth of
July is so important to me?

58:06.103 --> 58:09.073
'Cause that's the last time
I saw dad before he died.

58:12.476 --> 58:15.179
It was the last time the
three of us were all together.

58:19.149 --> 58:21.952
That's why I wanted
tonight to be so perfect.

58:26.957 --> 58:28.492
You're all I have left, Ange.

58:30.361 --> 58:31.295
You're my sister.

58:33.497 --> 58:35.099
Half-sister.

01:00:02.353 --> 01:00:03.253
What?

01:00:05.989 --> 01:00:07.257
"From the
desk of Professor

01:00:07.324 --> 01:00:10.260
J. Walter Harmon
to my colleagues.

01:00:10.327 --> 01:00:12.329
Please know that if
you're reading this,

01:00:12.396 --> 01:00:14.264
it is too late for me.

01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:17.101
Each day, I grow weaker
and increasingly paranoid

01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:20.404
of the possibility of my
research into the supernatural

01:00:20.471 --> 01:00:23.140
falling into the wrong hands.

01:00:23.207 --> 01:00:25.042
Dad.

01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:26.977
I believe that
these documents which I have

01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:30.013
gathered were created by
ancient evil spirits made

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.183
to look like significant
historical documents.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.419
These papers
function as a gateway

01:00:35.486 --> 01:00:38.155
for the evil spirits
to enter our world,

01:00:38.222 --> 01:00:41.959
possess the dead and wreak
havoc among the living.

01:00:42.025 --> 01:00:44.128
If any of them are recited-"

01:00:45.095 --> 01:00:46.363
The Declaration.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:49.166
"Under the right
ritualistic circumstances,

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:52.035
they theoretically
hold the power to raise

01:00:52.102 --> 01:00:55.506
with soulless purpose
an army of the undead."

01:00:56.573 --> 01:00:58.375
None of this makes any sense.

01:00:58.442 --> 01:01:00.577
"None of this
seems to make any sense to me

01:01:00.644 --> 01:01:05.048
as an academic, but it
all has a logic to it

01:01:05.115 --> 01:01:07.050
if you just understand."

01:01:07.117 --> 01:01:08.185
Well, shit.

01:01:08.252 --> 01:01:10.521
"If anything
is to happen to me,

01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:13.190
these documents
must be destroyed.

01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:17.294
The evil within them is too
powerful to go unchecked.

01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:21.265
As I feel myself succumbing
to my illness more and more,

01:01:21.331 --> 01:01:23.066
I leave these instructions.

01:01:23.133 --> 01:01:25.102
In the unfortunate
event that these

01:01:25.169 --> 01:01:27.438
evil spirits should
somehow be awoken,

01:01:27.504 --> 01:01:29.606
one must recreate
the conditions under

01:01:29.673 --> 01:01:32.609
which they were summoned in
order to banish them forever."

01:01:32.676 --> 01:01:36.480
Well, that was extremely
helpful and incredibly specific.

01:01:36.547 --> 01:01:38.382
"This may be the last

01:01:38.449 --> 01:01:41.552
correspondence I make with
the world of the living.

01:01:41.618 --> 01:01:44.388
I just pray that the
world knows growth,

01:01:44.455 --> 01:01:48.592
strength and tolerance and I
hope my children find peace."

01:01:49.593 --> 01:01:51.595
Damn, thanks dad.

01:02:07.177 --> 01:02:08.445
Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:10.147 --> 01:02:10.681
Okay.

01:02:12.316 --> 01:02:14.184
"We therefore, the
Representatives of the

01:02:14.251 --> 01:02:16.687
United States of America in
General Congress assembled."

01:02:17.588 --> 01:02:18.455
Fuck.

01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:21.258
Shit.

01:02:21.325 --> 01:02:23.260
Oh fuck, beer, oh shit.

01:02:25.162 --> 01:02:28.599
Americana, I mean it's more
of an idea than a tangible,

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.201
oh fuck, oh fuck.

01:02:46.216 --> 01:02:49.152
Get off, get off, let go.

01:02:55.225 --> 01:02:56.460
What do you want from me?

01:02:57.394 --> 01:02:58.629
The documents.

01:03:05.302 --> 01:03:10.307
♪ Oh beautiful America ♪

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:14.711
♪ From sea to shiny sea ♪

01:03:17.748 --> 01:03:20.417
Get your
fucking hands off me.

01:03:20.484 --> 01:03:21.385
Oh fuck.

01:03:24.756 --> 01:03:25.656
Shit.

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:31.128
What the fuck, somebody help me!

01:03:31.194 --> 01:03:34.565
Somebody help me,
somebody fucking help me!

01:03:40.737 --> 01:03:42.606
Nate, help me.

01:03:42.673 --> 01:03:43.674
Oh my god.

01:03:45.576 --> 01:03:47.411
All right, all right.

01:03:51.281 --> 01:03:52.215
Breathe. Breathe.

01:03:54.284 --> 01:03:55.319
Breathe.

01:03:55.385 --> 01:03:56.520
Okay.

01:03:56.587 --> 01:03:57.487
They've got Angela,

01:03:58.555 --> 01:04:01.258
that is a bummer.

01:04:02.326 --> 01:04:03.226
It really is.

01:04:04.628 --> 01:04:07.698
But it shows that I was right.

01:04:07.765 --> 01:04:10.567
I was right for staying in here.

01:04:11.836 --> 01:04:13.503
That counts for
something, right?

01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:21.278
They're in the house.

01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:24.514
Shit.

01:05:03.587 --> 01:05:05.522
I have to do something.

01:05:07.624 --> 01:05:08.525
After all,

01:05:10.394 --> 01:05:11.662
she's my sister.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.901
I'm coming, Ange.

01:05:23.908 --> 01:05:25.442
It's hero time.

01:05:46.463 --> 01:05:47.664
Let impeachment proceedings

01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:50.400
proceed.

01:05:58.508 --> 01:05:59.676
It's not here.

01:06:04.548 --> 01:06:06.616
Where is it?

01:06:06.683 --> 01:06:08.452
I told you,

01:06:08.518 --> 01:06:09.653
those are the only
documents that I know about.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.421
The Declaration,

01:06:12.456 --> 01:06:14.491
where did you put it?

01:06:14.558 --> 01:06:16.828
I don't know anything
about any Declaration.

01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:19.663
- She lies.
- Why are you doing this?

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:21.364
This goes against
everything that

01:06:21.431 --> 01:06:23.567
the Founding Fathers are
supposed to stand for.

01:06:23.633 --> 01:06:26.570
We must destroy
the Declaration.

01:06:27.772 --> 01:06:29.639
Then we will be unstoppable.

01:06:30.975 --> 01:06:32.642
America is sick,

01:06:32.709 --> 01:06:34.544
you disrespect the flag,

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:37.347
you disrespect each other,
you disrespect your leaders.

01:06:37.414 --> 01:06:40.852
This land needs resurrection.

01:06:42.486 --> 01:06:45.923
The dead shall rule
the living in a new era

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.892
of American history.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.763
Why don't you just kill me?

01:06:52.729 --> 01:06:54.464
We wouldn't kill you.

01:06:55.732 --> 01:06:57.935
You and your brother
instituted the ritual.

01:06:58.002 --> 01:07:00.938
We wouldn't be here without you.

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:08.745
So what, are you gonna use
us to bring back slavery?

01:07:10.714 --> 01:07:11.816
Slavery went away?

01:07:16.954 --> 01:07:18.488
Enough of this.

01:07:24.896 --> 01:07:27.865
"We the people of the United-"

01:07:27.932 --> 01:07:29.432
That's not gonna work.

01:07:30.034 --> 01:07:31.668
Why?

01:07:31.735 --> 01:07:35.907
Oh, because we don't
have Americana.

01:07:38.508 --> 01:07:39.043
We

01:07:39.944 --> 01:07:40.845
are

01:07:42.046 --> 01:07:42.947
Americana.

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:55.893
"We the people of
the United States,

01:07:57.527 --> 01:07:59.931
in order to form a
more perfect Union."

01:07:59.997 --> 01:08:02.465
There's nothing
perfect about this Union,

01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:05.937
mother fuckers.

01:08:10.908 --> 01:08:12.642
I forgot to put gas in that.

01:08:18.015 --> 01:08:18.950
No shells in that.

01:08:23.054 --> 01:08:25.857
Nobody move, I'm
gonna be right back.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:33.965
"In order to form a
more perfect Union."

01:08:35.564 --> 01:08:37.634
Happy Independence
Day, mother...

01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:38.568
FUCK

01:08:41.705 --> 01:08:42.606
Go get it.

01:08:47.044 --> 01:08:49.679
Nate, don't let him
get the Declaration.

01:08:55.618 --> 01:08:56.953
Get fucked, Abe.

01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:23.680
That smarts.

01:09:31.154 --> 01:09:34.058
Stay back, stay
back, Mr. Presidents.

01:10:31.916 --> 01:10:33.750
Bet you didn't
think you'd be able

01:10:33.818 --> 01:10:37.121
to hear fireworks all the
way out here, mother fuckers.

01:10:37.188 --> 01:10:39.056
Ah, hell fucking yeah, babe.

01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:41.624
That one's for Harriet.

01:11:07.918 --> 01:11:12.189
I believe you have
something that belongs to me.

01:11:12.256 --> 01:11:14.792
And I believe
you have something

01:11:14.859 --> 01:11:18.628
that belongs to the
American people.

01:11:30.274 --> 01:11:31.942
Goddammit.

01:11:32.009 --> 01:11:33.944
Show's over.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.717
Ange, oh my god, you're
okay, oh my god, oh my god.

01:11:40.785 --> 01:11:42.652
Come on, we gotta read
the Declaration again.

01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:44.188
It's the only way to send
those zombies back to hell.

01:11:44.255 --> 01:11:45.655
What?

01:11:45.722 --> 01:11:46.757
None of this makes any sense.

01:11:46.824 --> 01:11:48.292
Oh, it all has a logic to it,

01:11:49.894 --> 01:11:51.929
if you just understand.

01:11:54.265 --> 01:11:55.166
What?

01:12:09.712 --> 01:12:11.949
Did somebody order a
Declaration of Independence?

01:12:13.117 --> 01:12:14.852
Nate, you got it.

01:12:22.793 --> 01:12:23.761
Thank me later.

01:12:25.963 --> 01:12:27.131
- Hey babe.
- What?

01:12:27.198 --> 01:12:29.200
Thanks for coming back for me.

01:12:29.266 --> 01:12:30.167
Oh Nate,

01:12:31.836 --> 01:12:33.736
I think we should
see other people.

01:12:33.804 --> 01:12:34.338
What?

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:53.791
Thank you.

01:12:54.358 --> 01:12:56.327
I was looking for this.

01:13:03.834 --> 01:13:05.169
I cannot tell a lie.

01:13:06.971 --> 01:13:08.339
This is gonna hurt.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.109
Hey Washington,

01:13:12.176 --> 01:13:15.012
Washington, look behind you.

01:13:15.079 --> 01:13:16.147
The British are coming.

01:13:17.381 --> 01:13:20.284
I'm not turning around.

01:13:20.351 --> 01:13:22.319
No seriously,
there's like 50 of 'em.

01:13:22.386 --> 01:13:25.256
Yeah, and it looks like one
of 'em's kissing your wife.

01:13:26.357 --> 01:13:27.258
Martha?

01:13:40.037 --> 01:13:41.105
Nate, Nate.

01:13:44.141 --> 01:13:45.075
Sorry babe,

01:13:45.142 --> 01:13:45.976
ex-babe,

01:13:46.043 --> 01:13:46.877
Mary.

01:13:46.944 --> 01:13:47.845
Yep.

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:54.885
Holy shit, you saw that, right?

01:13:55.819 --> 01:13:56.887
Ew, ew, ew.

01:14:03.127 --> 01:14:04.995
"We therefore, the
Representatives of the

01:14:05.062 --> 01:14:08.866
United States of America in
General Congress assembled,"

01:14:08.933 --> 01:14:11.168
- fuck.
- Nothing is happening.

01:14:12.136 --> 01:14:13.137
Americana.

01:14:14.071 --> 01:14:15.339
What?

01:14:15.406 --> 01:14:17.041
This is gonna sound
so fucking stupid

01:14:17.107 --> 01:14:18.943
but the key to all
of this is the beer.

01:14:19.009 --> 01:14:21.845
Shit, I drank the last
two before I came out here.

01:14:21.912 --> 01:14:23.280
Damn you, past Nate.

01:14:23.347 --> 01:14:26.050
We just need more Americana.

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:34.959
"We therefore,

01:14:35.025 --> 01:14:36.293
the Representatives
of the United States

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.996
of America in General
Congress assembled,

01:14:39.063 --> 01:14:40.931
appealing to the Supreme Judge

01:14:40.998 --> 01:14:43.834
of the world for the rectitude
of our intentions do in the

01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:47.238
name and by authority of the
good people of these colonies

01:14:47.304 --> 01:14:50.341
solemnly publish and declare
that for the support of this

01:14:50.407 --> 01:14:54.011
Declaration with a firm
reliance on the protection

01:14:54.078 --> 01:14:56.914
of divine Providence,
we mutually pledge-"

01:14:56.981 --> 01:14:59.883
God damn America.

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:01.885
"We
mutually pledge to each other

01:15:01.952 --> 01:15:05.823
our lives, our fortunes
and our sacred honor."

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.098
You can't kill
me, I am America.

01:15:15.933 --> 01:15:20.170
No Mr. President, you're
not America anymore.

01:15:20.237 --> 01:15:21.138
No, no!

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.522
Looks like we're the
ones getting re-elected,

01:15:40.391 --> 01:15:41.492
mother fuckers.

01:15:46.997 --> 01:15:50.401
Not gonna lie, that was
pretty fuckin' cool.

01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:52.436
Yeah.

01:15:53.504 --> 01:15:54.538
Yeah, it was.

01:16:03.514 --> 01:16:04.982
I mean, you...

01:16:07.117 --> 01:16:08.018
Oh my.

01:16:19.196 --> 01:16:20.964
Did my leg come off?

01:16:34.044 --> 01:16:35.279
Am I gonna die?

01:16:35.346 --> 01:16:36.947
No, you're not
gonna die, it's okay.

01:16:37.014 --> 01:16:39.516
I've never met someone
with just one leg.

01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:41.985
Do you need two legs to live?

01:16:42.052 --> 01:16:44.121
No, hey bud, it's
okay, don't worry.

01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:46.357
Don't worry, I'm here for you.

01:16:46.423 --> 01:16:48.258
- Don't worry, okay?
- Yeah?

01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:57.434
We're kinda like
a team now, huh?

01:16:57.501 --> 01:16:59.603
Yeah, we work
pretty well together.

01:17:01.271 --> 01:17:03.374
I couldn't have worked
together without you.

01:17:05.075 --> 01:17:07.044
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:17:08.612 --> 01:17:11.482
Hey, I'm sorry to
interrupt this family moment,

01:17:11.548 --> 01:17:13.016
it seems really nice.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.351
Our ambulance is stuck

01:17:14.418 --> 01:17:17.121
on the gravelly,
winding nightmare road.

01:17:17.187 --> 01:17:21.125
Do you think you could walk...?

01:17:21.191 --> 01:17:22.993
Uh... yeah, we'll
get you in there.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.495
We'll get you in
there in just a sec.

01:17:26.363 --> 01:17:29.366
We wanted to tell you that
this ride is gonna cost

01:17:30.601 --> 01:17:34.004
$9,283.

01:17:34.071 --> 01:17:37.641
No, he has insurance,
so it should be covered.

01:17:39.076 --> 01:17:42.146
According to this, it's not.

01:17:42.212 --> 01:17:43.380
Are you fucking serious?

01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:46.583
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I
don't do well with bad news.

01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:48.552
I don't like delivering it

01:17:48.619 --> 01:17:50.287
but there is more bad news.

01:17:51.355 --> 01:17:53.190
It looks like your insurance

01:17:53.257 --> 01:17:56.293
isn't gonna cover the
reattachment of your leg.

01:17:57.261 --> 01:17:58.462
What?

01:17:58.529 --> 01:18:00.130
Yeah, it only covers limbs

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:03.066
that become missing
in the hospital.

01:18:03.133 --> 01:18:05.402
Is that supposed to
be some kind of joke?

01:18:05.469 --> 01:18:08.338
What kind of a fucked
up policy is that?

01:18:08.405 --> 01:18:09.506
I mean, that's insane.

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:13.110
We got some good news.

01:18:13.177 --> 01:18:14.211
We got some good news for you.

01:18:14.278 --> 01:18:16.113
Anything, man, please.

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.080
Yeah.

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:21.618
They're putting on another
fireworks show tonight

01:18:21.685 --> 01:18:24.655
and I think you're gonna
be just in time to see it.

01:18:32.563 --> 01:18:33.530
