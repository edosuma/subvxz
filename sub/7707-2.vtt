WEBVTT

00:02.837 --> 00:04.837
Well, thank you, thank you.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.505
And welcome
to the Second Annual

00:06.507 --> 00:09.375
Tanner Invitational
Croquet Tournament.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.643
- Yay!
- Okay.

00:11.645 --> 00:15.147
Uh, introducing
the defending champions

00:15.149 --> 00:16.749
Lynn and Brian Tanner.

00:16.751 --> 00:17.883
- 'Yeah.'
- Whoo!

00:17.885 --> 00:19.718
- 'Alright.'
- Yeah.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.653
And the challengers, Kate

00:21.655 --> 00:25.524
and, uh-uh, of course,
Willie Tanner.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.426
Boo! Hiss!

00:27.428 --> 00:29.628
Murder the bums!

00:29.630 --> 00:32.798
I thought referees were
supposed to be impartial.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.967
[blows whistle]
That's it, mouthing off.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.502
You're outta here.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.604
I think we need
a referee with at least

00:38.606 --> 00:41.373
a nodding acquaintance
with the rules.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.042
Now, see here.

00:43.044 --> 00:46.678
Croquet happened to be
Melmac's biggest sport.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.048
Only there it was
called muck sucking.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.617
ALF.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.719
Hey, I didn't name it.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.122
- Is it played the same?
- Exactly.

00:57.124 --> 01:01.560
Except you need four newly-wed
couples and Bob Eubanks.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.096
Oh-oh, and the swing
was slightly different.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.498
Here, I'll show you.
Block me, Willie.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.700
[gasps]

01:10.271 --> 01:12.037
[groaning]

01:12.039 --> 01:15.107
Now you see why it was
called muck sucking.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.377
Willie, are you alright?

01:18.379 --> 01:19.912
Ah, I'm not sure. I..

01:19.914 --> 01:22.214
- And I think my shin is broken.
- Oh.

01:22.216 --> 01:26.051
And he said he never played
this game before.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.420
Lynn, help me get
your dad in the house.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.622
Put him on the couch,
I'll have a look at him there.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.025
Stay away from me!

01:33.027 --> 01:34.827
I just wanna help.

01:34.829 --> 01:37.830
I just wanna be
a safe distance from you

01:37.832 --> 01:39.731
if there is such a place.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.134
[Willie grunts]

01:42.136 --> 01:44.937
Guess it's just you and me,
you little muck sucker.

01:44.939 --> 01:48.574
I don't wanna play with you,
ALF, you're too dangerous.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.544
Oh, what a day.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.913
First I broke
Willie's windshield.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.483
Then I broke Willie's power-saw.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.385
Now, I broke Willie.

02:00.387 --> 02:04.690
Sometimes I think the Tanners
will be better off without me.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.059
Sometimes I wish
I'd never come here.

02:08.162 --> 02:11.263
I wish, I wish..

02:11.265 --> 02:14.133
I wish I could figure out
this thing called gravity.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.303
[theme music]

02:46.700 --> 02:48.901
[music continues]

03:17.798 --> 03:20.232
[instrumental music]

03:20.234 --> 03:21.667
Oh!

03:21.669 --> 03:24.736
A wholly-owned subsidiary.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.172
You think
your shin hurts, Wilco.

03:27.174 --> 03:30.842
Take a gander
at the knot on my noggin.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.245
Will you please pass
the hearts of palm, father?

03:33.247 --> 03:35.314
- Certainly, son.
- Thank you.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.551
Did the temperature
just drop in here?

03:39.553 --> 03:43.222
And how did you get Brian
to eat hearts of palm?

03:43.224 --> 03:46.458
Hmm, a perfect compliment
to the steak tartare.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.693
Hmm.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.494
Hey, how about
a little sympathy?

03:49.496 --> 03:52.998
I just took a blow that
would've knocked out Mike Tyson.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.700
- Do you like some more, dear?
- Oh, thanks, mom.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.501
Mm-hmm.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.837
Alright, Cicely Tyson.

04:00.174 --> 04:02.641
Save room for
the creme brulee everyone.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.910
Oh, I for one, certainly will.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.013
Well, excuse me for bleeding.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.816
Wait. What is this?

04:10.818 --> 04:13.018
Freeze out the reckless alien?

04:14.255 --> 04:15.854
What a lot of food.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.123
There's certainly gonna be
a lot left.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.193
We wouldn't have any
leftovers if we had a dog.

04:21.195 --> 04:24.129
Right, we'd eat
the dog in one sitting.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.297
Ha! Ha!

04:28.035 --> 04:30.202
Isn't anyone gonna get repulsed?

04:31.839 --> 04:35.107
Come on, Tanners, talk to me.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.309
They can't see or hear you, ALF.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.746
[screams]

04:40.748 --> 04:43.348
Help! Help!
There's a stranger in the house.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.050
I've been unveiled.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.286
They can't see me either.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.454
Willie!

04:51.025 --> 04:53.825
Uh-uh, grease fire.
Grease fire!

04:56.864 --> 04:59.998
Funny, that usually
gets a big reaction.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.934
- Believe me now?
- No.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.736
I don't believe any of this.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.139
- Who are you?
- My name is Bob.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.475
- I'm your guardian angel.
- Right.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.377
And I'm the Easter alien.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.747
Well, I don't have all day.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.784
- Are you ready?
- Ready for what?

05:18.786 --> 05:21.019
To start your new life,
I'm here to grant you

05:21.021 --> 05:23.021
the wish you made
this morning.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.925
You got me a date
with Sheena Easton?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.328
Do you recall these words

05:29.330 --> 05:31.963
"I wish that I had
a different life?"

05:32.666 --> 05:34.099
I never said that.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.268
Oh, alright, I'm paraphrasing!

05:37.738 --> 05:40.205
If you must know
your exact words..

05:41.575 --> 05:44.376
"Sometimes I wish
that I'd never come here.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.611
I wish, I wish. Bonk."

05:46.613 --> 05:48.447
Y.. Bonk?

05:48.449 --> 05:50.716
Oh, yes, that's when
the mallet hit you.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.584
Now, do you remember
saying that?

05:52.586 --> 05:55.454
I say so many things.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.289
I'm a Scorpio, you know?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.759
Well, your wish
has been granted.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.194
History has been revised

06:02.196 --> 06:06.498
and your life with
the Tanners never happened.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.101
But I've wished
for a lot of things.

06:09.103 --> 06:12.037
How come this is the one
you're giving me?

06:12.039 --> 06:15.107
It's a new law.
The Capra Amendment.

06:15.109 --> 06:18.009
Anyone who asks for
a new life gets one.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.178
Colorization is optional.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.548
Yeah, well,
we better be going.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.784
Uh, yeah, okay, fine.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.420
Um, just give me
a minute to say goodbye.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.656
Alright, I give up.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.191
You made your point.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.395
Tell the guy from ghost-o-gram
over there to go home.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.966
It's no use, ALF,
they can't see you.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.468
If you don't believe me,
look in the mirror.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.304
[indistinct chatter]

06:47.408 --> 06:50.475
Strange. I thought
I broke that mirror.

06:50.477 --> 06:51.843
Look again.

06:53.013 --> 06:56.314
It is broken.
I don't see our reflections.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.619
Eek! We're vampires!

07:00.621 --> 07:02.053
No, we're not vampires.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.321
We don't cast reflections

07:03.323 --> 07:05.924
because we don't exist
in this place.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.261
Well, if I don't exist

07:09.263 --> 07:12.364
these poor people
must be miserable.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.399
You know, our lives
have turned out better

07:14.401 --> 07:17.202
than I ever dreamed
would have been possible.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.705
I agree, we have two wonderful
kids, comfortable income

07:20.707 --> 07:24.075
this great house
with no aliens living in it.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.710
You made them say that.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.078
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.213
- Did not.
- Did to.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.749
- Nuh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.418
Oh, by the way,
thanks again for the Maserati.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.553
Hmm. Our pleasure.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.355
Is it okay if I give
Julie my Porsche?

07:37.357 --> 07:39.157
- Oh, sure, honey.
- Thanks.

07:39.159 --> 07:42.394
It's her birthday
and I forgot to get her a card.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.466
Okay, so they've got
a little more money.

07:47.468 --> 07:48.500
[doorbell dings]

07:48.502 --> 07:50.168
I'll get it.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.540
Aren't you gonna ask me
to hide in the kitchen, Willie?

07:55.542 --> 07:57.275
Hi, guys, come on in.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.312
Brian has friends?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.547
They couldn't come over
when you lived here.

08:02.549 --> 08:05.517
Come on out back,
we just got a new slide.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.488
They're excited about a slide?

08:09.490 --> 08:13.291
- Big deal.
- It's a pool slide.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.694
Well, their yard isn't
big enough for a pool.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.395
It is now.

08:17.397 --> 08:21.066
They bought the Ochmonek's house
and tore it down.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.668
The Ochmonek's moved away?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.837
Not exactly.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.040
Your after dinner tea,
<i> monsieur, fraulein, senorita?</i>

08:29.042 --> 08:30.509
<i> - Merci.</i>
<i> - Danke.</i>

08:30.511 --> 08:31.543
<i> Gracias.</i>

08:32.846 --> 08:36.515
Don't tell me, they live in
the servants quarters?

08:36.517 --> 08:38.383
Exactly.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.052
Well, how did the Tanners
get all this money?

08:41.054 --> 08:43.688
Without you around,
there were fewer expenses.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.824
And you weren't here
to accidentally eat

08:45.826 --> 08:48.593
Willie's lottery ticket.

08:48.595 --> 08:52.197
Hey, I thought it
was a Wheat Thin.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.866
Well, if I don't live here,
where do I live?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.868
What's my life like?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.971
Oh, it's a wonderful life.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.674
Would you like a sneak preview?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.175
No.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.577
[instrumental music]

09:09.816 --> 09:11.650
Where are we?

09:11.652 --> 09:14.119
Cosmique Cosmetics.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.322
Oh, good,
I'm almost out of Henna Rinse.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.927
- This is where you work.
- Work?

09:21.929 --> 09:24.062
You mean in my new life
I have a job?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.031
Yes.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.066
But I'm a domestic alien.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.035
See, I belong at home.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.603
Guarding the refrigerator

09:31.605 --> 09:34.739
monitoring TV programming
for the children.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.677
Nevertheless, this is your
new life and in it, you work.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.881
We're falling behind
in our hourly quota.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.249
I better speed this thing up.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.385
You know how the boss
feels about quotas.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.854
Oh, sounds like
a great place to work.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.556
Thanks a lot, Bob-O.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.026
Maybe I should let
you meet the boss.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.361
You might like him.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.898
No, you don't understand.
I can't work.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.167
It'll put me in a tax bracket.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.070
- Ready to go?
- No.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.938
[snaps]

10:06.940 --> 10:09.240
I really wish I could do that.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.610
Only angels can
transport themselves.

10:11.612 --> 10:15.447
- No, I mean snap my fingers.
- 'Oh.'

10:16.883 --> 10:19.017
Well, this is the boss's office.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.719
What do you think?

10:20.721 --> 10:24.756
It could use a skylight
and a deli counter.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.359
And they say you're shallow.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.495
Look, Bob-O, I have
enough anxiety in my life

10:30.497 --> 10:33.832
without taking orders
from some slave driving jerk.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.468
Freddy! Freddy!

10:36.470 --> 10:38.536
Who do you think
you're kidding, huh?

10:38.538 --> 10:42.874
Your report was a mockery
of a travesty of a fake sham.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.010
Unless you think
you can live on unemployment.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.646
You better fix it.
To it pronto.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.419
Well, what do you think?

10:54.421 --> 10:59.190
I think he's an incredibly
handsome slave driving jerk.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.830
Send in Mavis Winkler.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.502
- Impressed?
- Yeah.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.438
That suit makes
my body look like a "V".

11:18.745 --> 11:21.479
I have the financial statements
for last quarter, Mr. Shumway.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.615
Thank you, Mavis.
How are we doing?

11:23.617 --> 11:28.153
Sales are up 122%
over the previous quarter.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.789
The cost of good sold
declined by 30%

11:30.791 --> 11:33.058
since we fully depreciated
the Peoria plant.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.693
- And the projected--
- Ho ho ho.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.362
Pull over and stay
in the vehicle, Mavis.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.331
- What's the bottom line?
- You're rich.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.901
- How rich?
- So rich.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.671
I maybe rich
but I'm not rich enough.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.674
- Raise prices immediately.
- I'll get right on that, sir.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.711
Never mind.
I'll handle it myself.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.447
Mary Elizabeth, can you
please come right in?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.558
Take a memo.

12:08.962 --> 12:12.230
How did I become
this captain of industry?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.432
Well, when you arrived on Earth

12:14.434 --> 12:18.103
you crashed into the cosmetics
section of Bloomingdale's.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.238
Blue radiator fluid
from your space craft

12:20.240 --> 12:23.308
leaked into a couple
of empty cosmetics bottles.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.543
Well, Jackie Onassis bought one.

12:25.545 --> 12:29.280
The other was allegedly
purchased by Bess Myerson.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.682
Well, Jackie wore the perfume

12:30.684 --> 12:33.418
to Leona Helmsley's
New Year's Eve party.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.254
Well, Leona flipped
for the fragrance

12:36.256 --> 12:38.456
and she asked Donald Trump
to take a sniff.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.359
Alright, alright.
I got the picture.

12:41.361 --> 12:45.029
Gee, give a man eternity
and he talks your ear off.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.731
Anyway to make
a long story short

12:46.733 --> 12:50.769
your radiator fluid is now
America's most popular perfume.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.238
Shumway Number 5.

12:53.240 --> 12:57.008
Huh. Did I do anything
with my axle grease?

12:57.010 --> 12:59.511
Shumway lip gloss.

12:59.513 --> 13:02.013
How about my carburetor sludge?

13:02.015 --> 13:04.549
Preparation Shumway.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.152
And all I had to do
is wish for all this?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.787
No starting in the mailroom?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.655
No marrying the boss's
ugly daughter?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.624
- None of that?
- That's right.

13:12.626 --> 13:16.127
And I don't have to hide from
the Alien Task Force anymore?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.629
The president called them off

13:17.631 --> 13:20.999
when you put the federal deficit
on your gold card.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.903
Okay, Bob. You win.
This life looks great.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.871
Sign me up.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.306
[snap]

13:28.308 --> 13:30.408
[keys clanking]

13:30.410 --> 13:32.310
I'll just get this paperwork
out of the way

13:32.312 --> 13:34.679
and it's a done deal.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.116
Try not to panic, Bob,
but I think we're on fire.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.551
Huh?

13:39.553 --> 13:42.754
Oh, don't worry.
Those are just clouds.

13:42.756 --> 13:46.491
Well, I guess I've looked
at these from both sides now.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.928
[plane droning]

13:49.930 --> 13:51.663
Is it my imagination?

13:51.665 --> 13:56.134
Or did a 747
just go by...under us.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.003
A clear violation
of our air space.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.672
I'll make a note.

14:02.943 --> 14:06.311
Look, it's Michael Landon.

14:06.313 --> 14:10.248
Hey, you.
Get off of my cloud.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.851
Ha ha.
Oh, I kill me.

14:14.254 --> 14:18.356
"Incidentally, your hobby
is racing Learjets.

You know, this new life
is gonna be great.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.669
I'm gonna be rich,
drive a big car.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.806
Make a note.
Call Sheena Easton.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.108
No, no, first I'll call
the Tanners

14:37.110 --> 14:39.310
and invite them over for pizza.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.679
Then we'll call Sheena Easton.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.349
I'm afraid that isn't possible.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.885
Well, fine.
Then call Kelly Girl.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.287
Tell them to send over
Kelly McGillis

14:49.289 --> 14:51.589
and Kelly Lebrock.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.826
I mean you won't be able
to invite the Tanners over.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.495
After the transition
you won't remember them.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.497
Oh, sure I will.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.466
Just because I'm gonna
be rich doesn't mean

15:01.468 --> 15:03.501
I'll forget the little people.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.869
I'm afraid you will, ALF.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.571
You'll forget the Tanners
and everything

15:06.573 --> 15:08.973
about your former life.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.242
Oh, everyone's a little
nervous at first.

15:11.244 --> 15:15.313
I'm sure you're going to be
very happy in your new life.

15:15.315 --> 15:19.017
Oh, I can't imagine being happy
in a life without the Tanners.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.252
Oh, come off it, ALF.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.021
Think of your secretary

15:23.023 --> 15:24.555
think of your profit margins

15:24.557 --> 15:26.658
think of your other secretary.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.594
And you saw how well the Tanners
were doing without you.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.797
Well, I guess you're right.

15:32.799 --> 15:37.201
But can I at least go back
and see them one last time?

15:37.203 --> 15:41.139
I've got to join
a frequent flier club.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.717
The engram gambit.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.754
I'm not sure I'm going
to be able to counter that.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.756
Do what I do!

15:58.758 --> 16:02.493
Wait for her to look away,
then eat the horse.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.699
Mother, father.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.801
How was the bassoon lesson,
Lynn?

16:09.803 --> 16:12.570
Teacher said my embouchure
is getting better.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.540
Well, until it does,
don't breathe on me!

16:16.443 --> 16:18.176
Wonderful, dear.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.511
Without me around

16:20.513 --> 16:23.047
all the straight lines
are going to waste.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.918
Well, I'm off.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.554
Going out back to the driving
range, are you, Brian?

16:29.556 --> 16:31.956
Yes, I've got to work
on my slice.

16:33.426 --> 16:37.228
Tell me again, father,
why do I enjoy golf so?

16:37.230 --> 16:38.563
Because it gives you
an opportunity

16:38.565 --> 16:40.765
to cultivate business contacts,
my boy.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.835
Oh, yes.
Thank you, father.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.674
Golf? Business contacts?

16:49.676 --> 16:52.543
Brian's supposed to be a kid,
not a republican.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.613
Nobody's having
any fun around here.

16:55.615 --> 16:59.017
I haven't heard anybody laugh
in the last five minutes.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.920
Oh, Katherine,
did I tell you the joke

17:02.922 --> 17:07.925
about the elephant's footprints
in...the cheesecake?

17:09.829 --> 17:11.863
No, I don't believe you did.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.499
Well..

17:15.235 --> 17:16.467
How do you know..

17:17.871 --> 17:22.073
...when an elephant
has been in your refrigerator?

17:23.443 --> 17:25.109
How?

17:28.314 --> 17:30.748
You'll find his footprints..

17:32.452 --> 17:34.685
...in the cheesecake.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.123
I see.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.693
This is pathetic.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.263
The Tanner's aren't
better off without me.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.231
They're bored.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.234
Worse than that,
they're boring!

17:50.236 --> 17:51.702
They don't seem unhappy.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.871
Well, that's because
they don't know any better.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.240
I'm not around
to liven things up.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.478
You know, Katherine..

18:00.480 --> 18:04.048
As wonderful as our lives are..

18:04.050 --> 18:08.886
...I sometimes get the feeling
that something's missing.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.690
Now that you've mentioned it,
I've been feeling the same way.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.525
- You made them say that.
- No, I didn't.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.626
- Yes, you did.
- Did not.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.894
- Did to.
- Nuh-uh.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.529
Uh-huh.

Why did you do that, dear?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.874
Every once in a while

18:29.876 --> 18:33.377
I just feel the need
to hear something breaking.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.013
- I told you they'd miss me!
- Don't be ridiculous.

18:36.015 --> 18:39.083
- They don't even know you.
- Okay, then they need me.

18:39.085 --> 18:43.221
Look at Willie. The poor guy
has to break everything himself.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.564
Will there be anything else?

18:54.801 --> 18:58.703
Would you be so kind
as to belch for us?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.974
[burps]

19:03.843 --> 19:05.676
Thank you, Raquel.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.712
No problem.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.616
That's disgusting!

19:11.618 --> 19:14.652
You wanted to say goodbye.
I think you should say it now.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.355
I changed my mind.
I'm not leaving.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.857
And you can't make me.

19:19.859 --> 19:20.758
[snaps]

19:20.760 --> 19:22.894
I stand corrected.

19:25.131 --> 19:28.132
- Sign here.
- I'm not signing.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.701
Well, have it your way.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.937
It's a mere formality, anyway.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.705
Look, the Tanner's
aren't better off

19:34.707 --> 19:37.375
just because
they have more money.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.776
And I don't wanna be rich

19:38.778 --> 19:41.145
if it means,
I'll never get to see them.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.848
It's the people
in your life that count.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.417
Not the material things.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.719
What is this,
"Family Ties?"

19:50.757 --> 19:52.990
Well, at the very least,
someone's gotta teach

19:52.992 --> 19:55.293
that Willie how to tell a joke.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.529
It's too late, ALF.
What's done is done.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.765
Well, forget it.
I'm not going.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.233
I know my rights.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.703
- Get me a lawyer.
- This is heaven.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.439
There are no lawyers here.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.308
Prepare to enter your new life.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.742
No! No! Wait! Wait!

20:11.744 --> 20:13.678

is a mistake.

Who's Bob?

21:06.366 --> 21:07.965

21:07.967 --> 21:10.935
See, I wished I never
crashed into your garage.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.638
So, Bob took me away from you.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.774
And Willie smoked a pipe.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.845
ALF, you were just dreaming.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.414
We found you in the backyard.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.583
You were unconscious.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.351
You were sucking muck.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.788
Yeah, you must have
knocked yourself out

21:30.790 --> 21:33.090
with the croquet mallet.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.660
I'm sorry
I yelled at you, ALF.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.428
We were really worried.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.297
We thought you might have..

21:39.299 --> 21:41.899
- Well, you know..
- Kicked the bucket?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.568
Bit the big one.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.637
Bought the box condo.

I'm done.

21:55.181 --> 21:59.684
ALF, I couldn't imagine what
life would be like without you.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.320
Believe me,
you don't wanna know.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.323
By the way.
Do we have a pool?

22:06.259 --> 22:07.758
No.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.694
It doesn't matter.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.729
I'm home now.

22:11.731 --> 22:14.965
The Maserati's probably not
happening either, right?

22:17.603 --> 22:19.804
Are you sure you're alright?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.173
Hey, what could be wrong?

22:22.175 --> 22:24.041
I'm here with my Tanners.

Everything's back to normal.

- Hold on a second.

What do you know about this?

23:14.527 --> 23:17.261
I notice it doesn't
absorb very well.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.865
Smells like radiator fluid.
