my whole career,

00:09.310 --> 00:12.586
nothing ever changes--
one big circle.

00:12.586 --> 00:14.724
All the people who are
supposed to believe in me,

00:14.724 --> 00:16.379
supposed to be at
my side of the table

00:16.379 --> 00:17.655

was different.

She is different.

I never met
anybody like her.

about you, jefe.

00:24.379 --> 00:26.344
I think it's
this business, man.

00:26.344 --> 00:29.586
Just constant rejection
and the line

00:29.586 --> 00:31.724
between success
and failure so thin

00:31.724 --> 00:32.758
that it eats at you.

you end up doing

00:34.137 --> 00:35.517
things that you
thought would never do.

what I'm saying, fool?

them turn "Valleys"

00:41.379 --> 00:42.586
into a shitty show.

00:42.586 --> 00:44.137
I gotta use my success
and end up

00:44.137 --> 00:45.793
making the show
that I want to make.

cookies and the phone?

00:52.689 --> 00:54.206

and I'm nervous

00:54.206 --> 00:55.827
when I don't know
if I passed my GED.

00:55.827 --> 00:57.172
I don't know if I passed.

00:57.172 --> 00:59.000
All right, listen to me.
I'm positive

00:59.000 --> 01:00.275
that you're
gonna pass that test.

Definitely.

I don't like

01:07.965 --> 01:09.172
the direction
of the show,

01:09.172 --> 01:11.034
and I'm gonna
demand a meeting.

01:11.034 --> 01:14.413
I will commit every fiber
of my being to "Valleys."

01:14.413 --> 01:15.965
I'll bring it in
on budget,

to promote it if I have to,

01:18.275 --> 01:19.655
but the one thing
I don't want to do is,

01:19.655 --> 01:21.551
I don't want to turn it
into a half-hour sitcom.

01:21.551 --> 01:25.931

let us think about it

nothing to think about.

to think about.

It's a crime, really.

other people's money.

You know, you should do
a Kickstarter campaign.

04:38.655 --> 04:40.655
Is that where, like,
the fans pay?

04:40.655 --> 04:43.034
It works, and as
the fans pile on,

04:43.034 --> 04:46.965
you build awareness
and excitement.

04:46.965 --> 04:49.344
So your fans pay you
to make "Valleys"?

04:49.344 --> 04:50.965
It's this thing called
the Kickstarter, man.

04:50.965 --> 04:52.517

how things get done.

The Urkel show.

Oh, that kid was comedy.

05:07.862 --> 05:10.275
So the story goes,
his contract was up

05:10.275 --> 05:12.551
and he wanted a raise because
the show was such a hit.

05:12.551 --> 05:14.000
Well, the network
agreed to bring him in,

05:14.000 --> 05:15.517

there, the waiting room

05:15.517 --> 05:16.724

African-American actors

George?

05:48.793 --> 05:50.413

your show made.

half the battle.

see how good it is,

Wow.
[phone tweets]

08:44.413 --> 08:47.620
Wait a minute. It's
a tweet from Maronzio.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.137
Damn, it's about time.

08:49.137 --> 08:53.000
He says he's fine.
"I am at peace.

09:10.448 --> 09:12.758
I know that parking lot.
It's right off Glen Oaks.

09:12.758 --> 09:14.931
Between that carpet center
and the Jon's Market?

09:14.931 --> 09:17.517
Yeah, right there where I met
those girls from Canoga Park.

09:17.517 --> 09:19.103
Wow, he sure looks happy.

09:19.103 --> 09:20.517
Exactly. Man,
that can't be Maronzio.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.586
I've never seen him
look like that.Mm-mm.

09:22.586 --> 09:25.172
Oh, man.
Bad traffic, huh?

09:25.172 --> 09:27.103
There'd better be
an accident up there.

09:27.103 --> 09:28.758
I'm just kidding
about the accident.

09:28.758 --> 09:30.793
You want traffic
to be bad for no reason.

I really gotta go, guys.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.862
I've still got
a long ways to go.

09:49.862 --> 09:51.758
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.896
Jesus was a carpenter,
so we built our crosses

09:53.896 --> 09:55.965
and we follow his path
bearing those crosses

09:55.965 --> 09:57.551
so we have
a better understanding

09:57.551 --> 09:59.517
of his suffering.
Okay. Uh...

09:59.517 --> 10:01.827
Does this journey end
at Big Lots or Sizzler?

10:01.827 --> 10:03.448
Look, man,
you look exhausted.

10:03.448 --> 10:05.655
You need to relax.
Just take a breather.

10:05.655 --> 10:08.241
Hey, hey,
watch the paint!

10:08.241 --> 10:09.758
So you weren't gonna
do anything more

10:09.758 --> 10:11.827
than just carry
that cross, right?

10:11.827 --> 10:12.896
I don't think so.

10:12.896 --> 10:14.689
Okay.
Maronzio, listen.

10:14.689 --> 10:15.896
I think it's great
that you've found

10:15.896 --> 10:17.275
something that gives
your life direction,

10:17.275 --> 10:18.620
but, you know, you're
in a vulnerable place

10:18.620 --> 10:20.034
with Shandra
and everything.

10:20.034 --> 10:21.758
Go slow, man. Maybe go
to church on Sunday.

10:21.758 --> 10:23.172
If you like it,
go Wednesday.

10:23.172 --> 10:24.448
And then, kind of
work your way up

10:24.448 --> 10:25.827
to a crucifixion.

10:25.827 --> 10:27.827
Look, I appreciate
your concern,

10:27.827 --> 10:30.206
but I really need to go
or Iron here's gonna beat me.

10:30.206 --> 10:32.586
Look, it's not a race
to salvation, Maronzio.

10:32.586 --> 10:34.758
I know, but I still don't want
him to beat me there first.

10:34.758 --> 10:38.275
All right.
Oh, did I tell you

10:38.275 --> 10:40.586
James Corden wants you
to do carpool karaoke?

10:40.586 --> 10:42.931
Really?No, he don't.

10:42.931 --> 10:45.344
But listen, you saw
how excited you got?

10:45.344 --> 10:47.655
Let that into
your heart, all right?

10:47.655 --> 10:48.896
From what I understand,

10:48.896 --> 10:50.482
God's love is unconditional.

10:50.482 --> 10:52.241
You don't have to do
any of this for it.

10:52.241 --> 10:54.931
All I have to do is
let him into my heart.

10:54.931 --> 10:56.482

11:03.965 --> 11:07.068
I mean, that does
sound reasonable,

11:07.068 --> 11:09.862
but will my cross fit?

11:22.586 --> 11:24.620
A Tesla.
This is major.

11:24.620 --> 11:27.241
Everyone will know that
Tyler Ratzberg has made it.

11:27.241 --> 11:29.724
Yeah. Hooray,
Tyler Ratzberg.

11:29.724 --> 11:31.241
Man, I mean, even
with the tax breaks,

11:31.241 --> 11:32.655
I never could have
afforded this

11:32.655 --> 11:33.758
without you having
to unload it.

11:33.758 --> 11:35.862
Now I can drive fast
and everyone

11:35.862 --> 11:37.000
will think I'm helping
the environment.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.896
Hey, man,
take the key and shut up

11:38.896 --> 11:40.379
or I'm calling CarMax.

11:48.724 --> 11:52.137
When they're with you,
it all seems to make sense.

11:52.137 --> 11:56.000
Like, they break it down
so simple and clear.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.689
Now it seems crazy
and that cross is heavy.

12:00.689 --> 12:02.862
Well, I suggest
now you get back

12:02.862 --> 12:04.172
to your true calling,
okay?

12:04.172 --> 12:05.758
Work on five tight minutes

12:05.758 --> 12:07.034

late night talk shows.

12:07.034 --> 12:08.620
Kimmel or Fallon
or somebody like that.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.862
And while you're doing that,
here's a great idea.

12:10.862 --> 12:12.241
You could help me
with your hollas

12:12.241 --> 12:13.896
'cause I got
a Kickstarter campaign.

12:13.896 --> 12:15.965

"Valleys" myself.

I can do that.
Maybe I can start out

with a rant about the lack
of diversity in media, huh?

12:20.172 --> 12:22.068

the ball rolling.

get nervous, Manolo,

No, don't,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.689

who's gonna be there

won't want to show up.

I'll go tell Lori.

12:51.862 --> 12:52.862
You want me to drive you?

12:52.862 --> 12:54.172
Oh, no.
I'll drive myself.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.275
While I'm gone,
you should probably

12:55.275 --> 12:56.931
just do something
with this cross.

12:56.931 --> 12:58.620
Maybe stash it
behind the treadmill,

12:58.620 --> 13:00.793
put some luggage
over it, vacuum.

13:00.793 --> 13:03.068
All right.

13:03.068 --> 13:05.275
So, you were right.
We raised the money

13:05.275 --> 13:07.827
to make "Valleys."
Oh, George,
that is great news.

13:07.827 --> 13:09.379
I am so happy for you.Thank you.

13:09.379 --> 13:11.448
I got a little good news
today myself.

13:11.448 --> 13:14.103
I have closed funding
on GVN London

13:14.103 --> 13:16.517
and it is my first step
into Europe.

13:16.517 --> 13:19.448

Ah, that's great.

13:19.448 --> 13:21.068
Thank you.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.103
You're not moving
to London, are you?

13:23.103 --> 13:25.068
Well, I might have to.

13:25.068 --> 13:26.275
Richard's putting
the money up,

13:26.275 --> 13:27.931
so he'll expect
close oversight from me.

13:27.931 --> 13:29.862
Richard?
Richard Branson.

13:29.862 --> 13:31.137
He's my partner.
Yeah, I know.

rockets and the hair.

13:52.931 --> 13:54.931

into "Valleys."

14:07.137 --> 14:09.137
the GVN in London, man.

14:09.137 --> 14:11.275
But, you know,
I think it's good.

14:11.275 --> 14:12.413
You know, she's got
her own plane.

14:12.413 --> 14:14.172
We learned something
about London,

14:14.172 --> 14:16.310
but I forgot it as soon
as I took the test.

14:16.310 --> 14:20.793
No! No freaking way!
Damn it!
What?

14:20.793 --> 14:23.965
"Valleys" is dead.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.137
They still own
the rights to "Valleys,"

14:29.137 --> 14:30.517
and they're just
gonna sit on it.

14:30.517 --> 14:33.379
They can keep you
from making it.
Why is that?

14:33.379 --> 14:34.793
All the studios
are like this

14:34.793 --> 14:35.965
ever since Warner Bros.

14:35.965 --> 14:37.689
let "Home Alone" go to Fox.

14:37.689 --> 14:40.103
It's like they gave their
competitors a billion dollars.

14:40.103 --> 14:41.551
So, that's it?
They just sit on it

14:41.551 --> 14:43.758
and then everybody
forgets about "Valleys"?

14:43.758 --> 14:45.482
Yeah. That's what
usually happens.

14:45.482 --> 14:49.517
So it's over?
Sorry, jefe.

14:49.517 --> 14:53.965
No! No, it's not over,
because I'm driving

14:53.965 --> 14:57.482
a six-year-old Civic
with 100,000 miles on it

14:57.482 --> 14:59.827
and a rattle
coming from somewhere

14:59.827 --> 15:01.344
I can't even figure out,

15:01.344 --> 15:03.827
and I'm not doing that
for nothing.

15:03.827 --> 15:06.965
Hah! It is not over.

15:14.034 --> 15:16.896
Hey.
Hey.

15:16.896 --> 15:19.068
I heard about "Valleys."
That sucks.

15:19.068 --> 15:20.793
Yeah, it really does,

15:20.793 --> 15:23.137
but I'm gonna find some
way to make it work.

15:23.137 --> 15:26.413
You really should.
It's a super-cool vis.

15:26.413 --> 15:29.448
And I'm really sorry
if I twisted things up.

15:29.448 --> 15:35.206
That's... Yeah.
Thanks.

15:35.206 --> 15:37.862
I forgive you.

15:37.862 --> 15:40.206
I know your heart
was in the right place,

15:40.206 --> 15:43.241
even if your body
was in the wrong one...

15:43.241 --> 15:44.724

15:44.724 --> 15:47.448
Jason has been getting
a ton of job offers.

15:47.448 --> 15:49.379
He's basically a hero
because he wanted to do

15:49.379 --> 15:52.172
the good version of
"Valleys." He owes you.

15:52.172 --> 15:54.275
Liking that script is
what got him so much heat.

15:54.275 --> 15:55.620
No, that just started
the ball rolling.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.344
George is what caused
so much heat.

15:57.344 --> 15:59.206
He is everywhere,
isn't he?

15:59.206 --> 16:01.344
Oh, did you know that UCB
is doing this, like,

16:01.344 --> 16:04.931
ironic stage performance of
the bad version of "Valleys"

16:04.931 --> 16:07.000
and it's selling out.
Whoa.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.965
I have some calls to make.

16:11.965 --> 16:15.103
Do you want to help?
Yeah.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.862
[applause]And the one person

16:20.862 --> 16:23.965
I really need to thank...

16:23.965 --> 16:26.931
is Wendy...[applause]

16:26.931 --> 16:29.551
who helped me and made me
believe in myself.

16:29.551 --> 16:33.896
Thank you.[applause]

16:33.896 --> 16:35.931
And finally, jefe.

16:35.931 --> 16:41.793
George Lopez, thank you
for being my best friend.

16:48.586 --> 16:51.448
Damn, that's the nicest speech
Shakey's has ever had.

16:51.448 --> 16:54.275
I'm so proud of you,
Manolo.
Thank you.

16:54.275 --> 16:56.103
The rest of you,
meet me at the claw machine

16:56.103 --> 16:58.896
to get your certificates.

16:58.896 --> 17:01.896
Nice job, Chico.
Thank you.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.344
I was wondering

17:03.344 --> 17:06.827
if you want to be
my birthing partner.

17:06.827 --> 17:07.793
Think about it.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.689
Oh, man, I knew you
could do it, brother.

17:12.689 --> 17:15.310
Yeah, you did,
even when I didn't.

17:15.310 --> 17:17.551
So, jefe,now that
I've graduated...

17:17.551 --> 17:19.000
I know.
I was expecting this.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.379
Kind of,
you want to get a job

17:20.379 --> 17:21.517
and get into
the workplace?

17:21.517 --> 17:23.482
No. I want to do
more for you.

17:23.482 --> 17:25.482
Yeah? Like what?
Like be my assistant?

17:25.482 --> 17:27.689
Heck, yeah.
Wow. All right.

17:27.689 --> 17:29.413
Well, I'm not sure how much
there is to assist with,

17:29.413 --> 17:30.724
'cause "Valleys" is dead
and stuff,

17:30.724 --> 17:33.068
but you've got the job
under one condition.

17:33.068 --> 17:36.172
I'm giving you a raise.
Oh!

17:36.172 --> 17:39.862
All right. You probably
need to go find Wendy.

17:39.862 --> 17:41.931
Thanks for the adjustment.

17:41.931 --> 17:43.241
George.
Hey, where you been?

17:43.241 --> 17:44.724
You missed
the whole thing.
What? No way.

17:44.724 --> 17:46.655
I've been watching
from the back...
Oh!

17:46.655 --> 17:50.206
while fielding phone calls
from Amazon and HBO.

17:50.206 --> 17:52.068
About what?
"Valleys" is dead.

17:52.068 --> 17:53.310
Well, "Valleys"
might be dead,

17:53.310 --> 17:55.413
but you are
very much alive

17:55.413 --> 17:56.793
and they all know it.

17:56.793 --> 17:59.034
Did you know Coco put
you up for a GLAAD award

17:59.034 --> 18:02.275
for your strong defense
of the transgender community?

18:02.275 --> 18:04.827
George, you are trending.Really?

18:04.827 --> 18:06.034
You have connected

18:06.034 --> 18:08.827
with the most diverse demo
I have ever seen.

18:08.827 --> 18:11.655
Latinos, African-Americans,
millennials,

18:11.655 --> 18:15.275
LGBT, QISes and ASes,
and hipsters.

18:15.275 --> 18:16.655
Oh, don't forget
angry white people.

18:16.655 --> 18:17.793
Oh, that's right.

18:17.793 --> 18:21.000
George Lopez,
you are a relevant.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.689
Wow. Wow, I'm relevant.

18:22.689 --> 18:25.103
And I did it without
Brooklyn or anal.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.655
Yeah, exactly.

18:26.655 --> 18:29.655
Everyone wants in on
the George Lopez business.

18:29.655 --> 18:32.068
You can do
whatever you want.

18:32.068 --> 18:34.965
Well, Olly, you know what?
You've done a great job.

18:34.965 --> 18:38.000
I truly,
truly appreciate it.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.206
[phone ringing]

18:40.206 --> 18:42.896
Oh! Hold that thought.
Hulu is calling.

18:42.896 --> 18:45.413
Hello.
Please hold for Olly.

18:45.413 --> 18:47.517
I knew that.
I knew it.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.103
Congratulations, George.

18:51.103 --> 18:52.551
[laughing]
Oh, thanks, Maronzio.

18:52.551 --> 18:53.551
You don't seem like a guy

18:53.551 --> 18:54.758
who's on top of the world.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.931
No, I don't, do I?

18:56.931 --> 18:58.689
I kind of wish Lori
was here to see this.

18:58.689 --> 19:01.379
Very sweet.
So do something
about it.

19:01.379 --> 19:03.551
Look, I know you're
being casual,

19:03.551 --> 19:05.413
but I lost Shandra
by being casual.

19:05.413 --> 19:07.103
I was walking around
with a cross

19:07.103 --> 19:08.586
because
I was being casual.

19:08.586 --> 19:10.413
I think this is
what Lori wants.

19:10.413 --> 19:12.344
Is this what you want?
No.

19:12.344 --> 19:13.448
You know,
when I'm with her,

19:13.448 --> 19:16.758
I kind of feel
like she wants more.

19:16.758 --> 19:19.551
Then do something
about it.

19:19.551 --> 19:22.206
Yeah. You know,
I'm gonna find her,

19:22.206 --> 19:23.344
and I'm gonna tell her

19:23.344 --> 19:25.379
that I'm tired
of living like this

19:25.379 --> 19:26.448
and I don't want to
be alone,

19:26.448 --> 19:28.103
and I want her today,
tomorrow,

19:28.103 --> 19:30.551
and for the rest
of my life.

19:30.551 --> 19:32.206
What's she gonna do?
Say no?

19:32.206 --> 19:35.896
I'm relevant.
[laughing]

19:40.448 --> 19:42.448
So, Lori, I'm tired
of pretending

19:42.448 --> 19:43.793
I have all the answers,
'cause I don't,

19:43.793 --> 19:45.896
and I'm tired of
making people believe

19:45.896 --> 19:49.413
I can do everything
by myself. I can't.

19:49.413 --> 19:51.034
I don't want to live
like that anymore, Lori.

19:51.034 --> 19:54.275
I'm tired and I don't
want to be alone anymore.

19:54.275 --> 19:56.620
George.
I want you, Lori,

19:56.620 --> 19:57.896
and I will do
whatever it takes

19:57.896 --> 19:58.862
to prove that to you.

19:59.931 --> 20:03.413
Oh, George.

20:03.413 --> 20:05.758
I can't be happier
to hear what you're saying.

20:09.137 --> 20:12.827
You are going
to love London.
