Dad, look at me.

01:15.841 --> 01:18.243
I'm the star here.

you've made some

my game.

Chase, to beat the competition,

Well, then what's yours, Nanny?

But this ain't one

How're you making

09:01.240 --> 09:03.899

just call Mikey.

something or a masseuse coming?

- Welcome to your new suite.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.407
- Why'd you do it for me?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.942
- So you can get

10:07.440 --> 10:09.942
a good night's sleep!

Since I was up all night

10:13.212 --> 10:16.820
because of your snoring,

10:16.115 --> 10:19.818
I came up with the brilliant

10:16.115 --> 10:19.818
idea to give you a suite

10:19.852 --> 10:22.956
within your own home,

10:19.852 --> 10:22.956
so that you can lay in here

10:22.989 --> 10:25.725
and sleep

10:22.989 --> 10:25.725
in a calm environment.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.327

10:25.759 --> 10:28.327
an issue sleeping.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.309
- Well, honey,

10:28.360 --> 10:31.309
you do have an issue.

10:31.639 --> 10:33.399
- Okay, well, I don't know it.

10:31.639 --> 10:33.399
- You make noises

10:33.432 --> 10:35.701
that dead animals

10:33.432 --> 10:35.701
make out in the wilderness.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.671
- Todd, stop it.

10:37.703 --> 10:40.399
- We've slept in the same bed

10:37.703 --> 10:40.399
for 25 years.

10:40.730 --> 10:42.174
We're gonna continue sleeping

10:40.730 --> 10:42.174
in the same bed.

10:42.207 --> 10:44.177
Unless you choose

10:42.207 --> 10:44.177
to go to the sofa.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.129
- To the sofa.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.129
Now, I know it's beautiful.

It smells good.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.817
- Exactly.

10:50.850 --> 10:54.200
- But honey, this is nicer than

10:50.850 --> 10:54.200
a suite at The Four Seasons.

10:54.539 --> 10:55.187
- Oh, my gosh.

- Hi. Um, I'm Tabitha.

12:17.671 --> 12:18.937
This is my son Mikey.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.673
- Mikey?

- Hi.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.309
- Mikey, do you have

12:22.750 --> 12:24.309
a grocery route?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.613
- I do, yes.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.613
- Ooh.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.947
- So Mikey's been losing

12:26.645 --> 12:28.947
a lot of customers lately,

12:28.981 --> 12:30.482
and we noticed that

12:28.981 --> 12:30.482
you've been running

12:30.517 --> 12:32.118
a smear campaign on my son.

Mikey was kid.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.269
Mikey, I want to apologize.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.136
I took it a little bit too far.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.600
I would never take a business

14:20.427 --> 14:21.927
what the big deal is.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.495
- Grayson, I don't think

14:21.961 --> 14:23.495
you understand.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.131
Like, normally when couples

14:23.529 --> 14:26.131
start sleeping

14:26.166 --> 14:27.333

14:27.366 --> 14:29.201
it's kind of like

14:27.366 --> 14:29.201
the beginning of the end.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.338
- Maybe she's finally

14:29.235 --> 14:32.338
throwing in the towel.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.807
Maybe they're divorcing.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.777

Grayson mentions it,

14:41.114 --> 14:44.317

But who's the most difficult

14:53.893 --> 14:55.327
- We're not, Grayson.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.327
Let me tell you something.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.923
we've gone to that level.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.393
- Then why are you sleeping

17:05.250 --> 17:06.393
in separate beds?

- Because I've been snoring.

17:12.766 --> 17:13.866
getting a divorce?

I mean--

17:13.900 --> 17:15.634
- Yeah.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.874
- Well, maybe we do.

17:20.906 --> 17:24.243
Obviously, this whole thing has

17:20.906 --> 17:24.243
really affected our children.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.460
- Yeah, because they're idiots,

17:24.277 --> 17:26.460
and they jumped

17:26.789 --> 17:28.347
to a stupid conclusion.

Shocking!

17:28.381 --> 17:30.500

17:30.500 --> 17:32.184
how to make it right.

17:54.941 --> 17:57.109
just orange and peach?

17:57.143 --> 17:59.378
No, throw some raspberries

17:57.143 --> 17:59.378
in there

17:59.412 --> 18:01.614
or some strawberries,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.614
or something.

18:01.647 --> 18:02.848
- Why do you have

18:01.647 --> 18:02.848
to have everything?

18:02.882 --> 18:04.384
This is not a juice bar.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.251
- You could've fooled me.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.391
Nan!

18:09.521 --> 18:11.391
- Hi!

18:11.423 --> 18:13.492
- What's up, gorgeous?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.492
- Hey, darling.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.195
- Oh, Lord, I come to visit.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.195
- You want a smoothie?

18:16.229 --> 18:18.865
- Oh, gee, I'd love that.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.865
That looks so good now.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.267
- What's going on

18:18.897 --> 18:21.267
with the shirt?

18:21.300 --> 18:23.202
- Mikey's Del--

18:21.300 --> 18:23.202
[laughs]

18:23.236 --> 18:24.938
- I'm advertising for him.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.940
- Get out of here.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.940
- That was my competition.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.540
- I thought we were over this.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.277
- But now I just gave it

18:28.575 --> 18:31.277
all to him.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.413
- You gave him the business?

18:31.310 --> 18:33.413
- Yeah.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.949
- Well, that's what

18:33.445 --> 18:35.949
a good grandmother would do.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.151
- Except, but he needs

18:36.490 --> 18:38.151
some guiding,

18:38.183 --> 18:40.519
and I'm gonna help him

18:38.183 --> 18:40.519
build it bigger and bigger.

18:40.552 --> 18:43.423
And he's getting new customers

18:40.552 --> 18:43.423
on my reputation.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.157
- What kind of

18:43.455 --> 18:45.157
reputation you got?

18:45.191 --> 18:46.925
- I deliver on time,

18:46.960 --> 18:48.528
I got good morals,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.130
and I'm a good leader.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.130
- Uh!

18:50.163 --> 18:52.531
- The morals, you don't use--

18:50.163 --> 18:52.531
- Your moral compass is--

18:52.565 --> 18:54.299
- You hang out in casinos.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.535
- Well, that's the best moral

18:54.334 --> 18:55.535
in the world.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.836
- You drink.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.304
- Todd, I'm gonna tell you

18:56.869 --> 18:58.304
one more damn time.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.573
You need to just

18:58.337 --> 19:00.573
sit there and hush.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.343
I'm glad that Mikey and I

19:00.606 --> 19:03.343
figured things out.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.246
You know, Mikey has that

19:03.375 --> 19:06.246
hustling instinct in him,

19:06.278 --> 19:08.809
just like me.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.317
- What about me, Nanny?

19:08.114 --> 19:11.317
- Well, you're not no hustler.

19:13.190 --> 19:14.921
- I've helped you

19:13.190 --> 19:14.921
with literally everything

19:15.210 --> 19:17.190
that you ever wanted to do.

19:17.222 --> 19:20.259
- But there wasn't

19:17.222 --> 19:20.259
no work involved.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.328
I even let him

19:20.259 --> 19:23.328
use my golf cart to deliver.

19:23.363 --> 19:27.329
So now we on good terms,

19:23.363 --> 19:27.329
and I'm gonna make it roll.

19:27.329 --> 19:28.680
- Only you would get involved

19:28.101 --> 19:29.635
with a 12-year-old

19:28.101 --> 19:29.635
in a turf war.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.742
<i>[lively classical music]</i>

19:37.576 --> 19:39.311
<i>- How long you think</i>

19:37.576 --> 19:39.311
<i>you can plank?</i>

19:39.346 --> 19:40.747
- At least four minutes.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.182
Like--maybe three. - No,

19:40.779 --> 19:42.182
there's no way.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.182
- I'll give you

19:42.214 --> 19:43.182
a hundred bucks

19:43.215 --> 19:44.851
if you can do it for five.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.619
- Okay.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.619
- Plank, bitch.

19:47.653 --> 19:48.887
I'll bet he gets through

19:47.653 --> 19:48.887
a minute and a half

19:48.922 --> 19:49.888
and collapses.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.257
Put that ass down.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.425
- So.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.425
- So how's life?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.228
- There's no way

19:53.460 --> 19:55.228
I'm doing five.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.630
- Don't be a loser.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.630
- Grayson, I can do five.

19:57.970 --> 19:58.932
- Chase, you can't even run

19:57.970 --> 19:58.932
half a mile.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.101
- Ooh, he's getting tired.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.101
- Ooh, you're dropping.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.969
- Why's your back

20:01.134 --> 20:02.969
arched like that?

20:03.299 --> 20:04.336
Oh!

20:03.299 --> 20:04.336
- Oh, he fell. What is it?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.904
- You only got a minute

20:04.371 --> 20:05.904
and 20 seconds.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.272
- There's no way.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.272
- Yeah.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.342
- That's not bad, though.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.342
- I mean, you did good.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.211
- Hello.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.113
- What're you bringing in?

20:13.145 --> 20:15.448
'Cause if that's

20:13.145 --> 20:15.448
a makeup case, it looks wack.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.518
- I wish it were a makeup case.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.518
- What is it?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.153
- It's called a CPAP machine.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.855
It's supposed to help

20:20.185 --> 20:21.855
with my snoring

20:21.887 --> 20:23.890
and help me sleep better.

20:23.123 --> 20:25.692
- And help me sleep better.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.161
- Yeah, that too.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.430
You wear it at night.

20:30.462 --> 20:34.233
[laughter]

20:34.267 --> 20:35.634
- Mama!

20:34.267 --> 20:35.634
- There's no way!

20:35.669 --> 20:37.237
- I would feel claustrophobic.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.837
- Do a Darth Vader voice,

20:37.269 --> 20:38.837
Mama.

20:38.872 --> 20:41.907
Do it.

20:38.872 --> 20:41.907
- Grayson, I am your mother.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.376
[laughter]

20:44.411 --> 20:46.311
- Sleeping with this I know's

20:44.411 --> 20:46.311
gonna be kind of annoying,

20:46.346 --> 20:47.846
and if you don't feel like

20:47.881 --> 20:49.715
you can do it,

20:47.881 --> 20:49.715
we can work something else out.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.317
- I'm just glad

20:49.749 --> 20:51.317
we got some help.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
- I am, too, because I had

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
nobody to lay my leg on.

20:53.519 --> 20:54.887
So I'm glad that you're gonna

20:53.519 --> 20:54.887
be back in the bed

20:54.921 --> 20:55.922
so I can be comfortable.

20:54.921 --> 20:55.922
-

20:55.954 --> 20:57.356
- All right.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.356
- [laughs]

20:57.390 --> 20:59.592
- We are sorry

20:57.390 --> 20:59.592
for the misunderstanding,

20:59.625 --> 21:02.595
and we can assure you,

20:59.625 --> 21:02.595
if we have any other issues,

21:02.628 --> 21:05.131
whether it be snoring

21:02.628 --> 21:05.131
or otherwise...

21:05.164 --> 21:06.199
- We won't tell y'all.

21:06.231 --> 21:07.701
- And we'll stay

21:06.231 --> 21:07.701
in the same bedroom.

21:07.733 --> 21:08.968
- Yes.

21:09.690 --> 21:10.970
- Yeah, because I was having

21:09.690 --> 21:10.970
a heart attack.

21:11.710 --> 21:13.440
My anxiety level

21:11.710 --> 21:13.440
was through the roof.

21:13.472 --> 21:14.973
- That's because y'all

21:13.472 --> 21:14.973
are drama queens.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.769
- No. He's--

21:15.750 --> 21:17.769
- He is a drama queen.

21:17.769 --> 21:18.278
- You cannot fault them

21:17.769 --> 21:18.278
for that

21:18.310 --> 21:19.511
because that comes from you.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.948
- Ha, yeah, right. Yeah.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.948
- He's very emotional.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.917
- Grayson, you were crying too!

21:21.980 --> 21:24.917
- You made me fake cry!

21:24.951 --> 21:25.919
- [laughs]

21:25.951 --> 21:27.886
- We would never

21:25.951 --> 21:27.886
leave each other.

21:27.921 --> 21:30.123
But we might leave y'all.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.324
- Hmm.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.324
- [laughs]

21:31.357 --> 21:33.930
<i>- So we're all</i>

21:31.357 --> 21:33.930
<i>on the same page.</i>
