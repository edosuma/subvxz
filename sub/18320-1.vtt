00:32.891 --> 00:35.021
Hello, I'm David Brent.

00:35.102 --> 00:40.022
You probably know me as the star
of the BBC Two documentary The Office,

00:40.107 --> 00:42.897
back in 2000 and...

00:43.027 --> 00:44.843
No, that was then, this is now.

00:44.903 --> 00:47.703
I'm currently a singer-song writer, so...

00:47.781 --> 00:48.847
And a rep.

00:48.907 --> 00:51.077
I work for Lavichem.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.851
What do you mean who does my tampons?

00:52.911 --> 00:55.854
We sell cleaning products.

00:55.914 --> 00:57.856
All toiletry needs, really.

00:57.916 --> 01:01.036
One size fits all.
No, it doesn't, actually.

01:01.128 --> 01:05.838
I am following my dream as the lead singer
in the band Foregone Conclusion.

01:05.924 --> 01:07.866
This is our story.

01:07.926 --> 01:10.966
I never really gave up
that dream if I'm being honest.

01:11.096 --> 01:12.596
So when the documentary team

01:12.723 --> 01:15.874
approached me and said they wanted
to continue the Brent saga,

01:15.934 --> 01:17.876
I said, "Sure, but let's do it big."

01:17.936 --> 01:20.686
That's as stiff as you like
and it won't damage your rug.

01:20.773 --> 01:23.273
Well, that's what I told her.

01:23.359 --> 01:26.885
One last push to see if I can make it
in the music business.

01:26.945 --> 01:28.275
Watch this space.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.366
Let's rock.

01:38.957 --> 01:41.900
# Half a tank should get me to Millbank

01:41.960 --> 01:45.800
# I fill her up and head down to Sidcup

01:45.923 --> 01:49.013
# It's just a meeting
It's only fleeting

01:49.134 --> 01:52.644
# It's just a pitch
And then I'm up to Ipswich

01:52.763 --> 01:55.914
# Life on the road

01:55.974 --> 01:58.394
# Don't need a heavy load

01:59.937 --> 02:02.807
# Foot down to the floor

02:02.940 --> 02:06.650
# Seventy miles an hour
But no more

02:13.992 --> 02:17.582
# Wheeler dealing no feeling

02:17.663 --> 02:20.923
# Strictly business
I'm killin' it in Widnes

02:20.999 --> 02:24.589
# Then to Gloucester
I get a Costa

02:24.670 --> 02:27.946
# Hard shoulder
Coffee holder

02:28.006 --> 02:30.966
# Life on the road

02:31.051 --> 02:34.931
# Don't need a heavy load

02:35.013 --> 02:38.023
# Foot down to the floor

02:38.142 --> 02:44.942
# Seventy miles an hour
But no more #

02:45.023 --> 02:47.863
Personal parking space. Typical.

02:53.031 --> 02:55.281
Oh, here they are.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.489
- Ooh, lovely Serena.
- What?

02:58.620 --> 03:00.979
No, I was just saying.

03:01.039 --> 03:02.869
- When you buying me dinner?
- Never.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.790
No, I'll buy.

03:04.877 --> 03:07.087
Morning. Made you a coffee.

03:07.212 --> 03:10.302
We play these games.
Um, they know I'm available.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.990
It's not like they're
coming on to a married man.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.300
So, all good fun.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.927
I'm in the marketplace, so to speak.
You know, young, free and single.

03:17.055 --> 03:18.385
Not gonna settle down just yet.

03:18.474 --> 03:20.484
I've been out with all sorts of girls.

03:20.601 --> 03:24.851
Rich girls, poor girls, white girls.

03:24.938 --> 03:25.978
You know.

03:26.064 --> 03:28.864
Thin girls, fat girls.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.902
I went out with a very big lady.

03:31.028 --> 03:33.448
Mmm, lovely. Bubbly.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.820
Mmm, beautiful eyes.

03:35.908 --> 03:39.017
All my mates were like, "Oh, Brent, if she
lost weight she'd be an absolute stunner."

03:39.077 --> 03:40.537
And she did lose weight.

03:40.662 --> 03:44.752
And, um... and she wasn't a stunner,
which was very disappointing.

03:44.875 --> 03:47.025
Um, a surprise to everyone.

03:47.085 --> 03:51.045
I think she'd left it a bit late in life
and lost it way too quickly.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.841
So she was left
with that sort of wattle thing.

03:53.926 --> 03:54.966
You know...

03:55.093 --> 03:59.037
And she wasn't bubbly any more.
Bit grumpy.

03:59.097 --> 04:00.427
Always hungry.

04:00.516 --> 04:02.926
So lesson learned. Be what you are.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.650
So, yeah, that's the plan.

04:05.729 --> 04:09.019
Tour, record deal, stick an album out,

04:09.107 --> 04:12.050
make some big bucks, get a fancy crib,

04:12.110 --> 04:14.990
then snare a lucky lady. Yeah.

04:15.113 --> 04:19.057
But at first, life on the open road.
It's in my blood, uh...

04:19.117 --> 04:21.327
- Do you drive?
- You know I do.

04:21.452 --> 04:23.663
I've given you a lift home several times.

04:23.747 --> 04:26.707
- What car you got?
- Red Honda.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.792
Lady across the road from me
has got a red Honda.

04:28.919 --> 04:31.959
That's me.
I live across the road from you.

04:32.089 --> 04:33.709
Oh. Wondered why she was always waving.

04:33.799 --> 04:37.009
Thought she was mental. That explains it.

04:37.135 --> 04:39.795
- I'd like to see you live.
- Ooh, don't know.

04:39.930 --> 04:44.060
The lyrics are a bit hot for you. X-rated.

04:44.142 --> 04:48.902
We got one song, it's about rock 'n' roll,
but it's a metaphor for sex.

04:49.981 --> 04:54.186
It goes... # I'm gonna roll you over
And rock you stupid

04:54.319 --> 04:56.949
# And leave you there just hummin'

04:57.030 --> 05:03.101
# There's a party in my trousers, baby
And everybody's comin' #

05:03.161 --> 05:06.161
You get it?
Ask me how I'm spelling "comin" '?

05:06.290 --> 05:09.107
- How are you spelling "comin" '?
- C-U-M-I-N.

05:09.167 --> 05:10.167
That's cumin.

05:10.294 --> 05:11.544
Double M. Think.

05:11.628 --> 05:14.112
It's... So, yeah.

05:15.122 --> 05:17.002
That sort of coming.

05:17.217 --> 05:22.013
Well, not with... But with... You know.
Although some women do...

05:23.181 --> 05:24.181
squirt.

05:25.183 --> 05:26.183
Don't know what.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.308
Juice.

05:30.188 --> 05:31.188
No one knows.

05:32.357 --> 05:34.187
Right, see you later.

05:35.193 --> 05:36.943
You know, we're top salesmen here.

05:37.446 --> 05:40.026
Sort of like the dream team, really,
some of these guys.

05:40.157 --> 05:42.987
- Jezza. Just biggin' you up.
- Sorry, mate, I'm talking, what?

05:43.076 --> 05:45.786
He's great when he's out with the clients.
They love him, but...

05:45.871 --> 05:48.161
he wants... I don't know...
he's like a kid, he wants attention.

05:48.248 --> 05:51.149
You know, you see a man that age
and you think, "What are you doing?"

05:51.209 --> 05:53.459
Lovely Serena again.
The one that plays hard to get.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.337
- Please, Brent.
- No.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.462
- I can't stand him.
- Okay.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.800
I know how that looks.

05:57.883 --> 06:00.158
I know in your little documentary thing

06:00.218 --> 06:03.098
you're just gonna paint me out
to be, like, the bitch, but...

06:03.221 --> 06:05.221
if I give him an inch, that's it.

06:05.349 --> 06:06.469
Here's the boss.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.850
Keeping an eye on us
is, uh, head of sales, Andy Chapman.

06:11.897 --> 06:15.173
I used to have my own office.
Better than that in a way.

06:15.233 --> 06:19.243
I prefer it out here with the troops
because we have a laugh.

06:19.363 --> 06:23.623
I'm sort of my own boss,
but we're all equal, so anything goes.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.183
I'm one of the lads.

06:25.243 --> 06:27.373
What's he doing?

06:27.454 --> 06:32.004
- Ah, Mr Brent.
- "Ah, Mr Brent."

06:32.084 --> 06:34.594
- What is that?
- Fuck knows.

06:35.291 --> 06:38.804
"Fuck knows." Oh, my God,
I have to sit next to this nutter.

06:38.882 --> 06:40.632
Fuck know... Fuck nose.

06:40.717 --> 06:42.257
Are you sure you want a pun war with me?

06:42.386 --> 06:45.096
I love puns.
Highest form of wit in my opinion.

06:45.222 --> 06:49.392
Nigel gets it 'cause he's a bit cooler,
like me, not a corporate stuffed shirt.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.096
He's a mentalist.

06:51.228 --> 06:54.018
Maracas. These are my knackers, more like.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.106
Bollocks.

06:56.233 --> 06:58.863
Look, aren't my plums a bit red, Doctor?

06:58.944 --> 07:02.220
Turn round and see plums in your face.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.660
Top banta. They call us Bant and Dec.
Don't they?

07:04.741 --> 07:07.225
- Well, we sometimes call ourselves that.
- Yeah.

07:07.285 --> 07:08.485
And Brentertainment.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.960
- That's more you.
- You're in. Come here.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.054
David's David, isn't he?

07:18.130 --> 07:20.460
He's just... He's a lovely bloke.
I think he's brilliant.

07:20.549 --> 07:23.299
Makes me laugh anyway.
I know most people don't get him...

07:25.303 --> 07:26.244
but I do.

07:26.304 --> 07:29.247
Most people don't get me, but he does.
So it's nice.

07:29.307 --> 07:31.137
It's good that we've found each other.

07:31.268 --> 07:33.728
He's gonna help me, um, showcase
some of my comedy characters.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.194
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Aren't you? Trying to get that done.

07:36.314 --> 07:38.734
Got one character called Lionel Fancy.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.649
Oh hello, my name's Lionel Fancy.

07:40.736 --> 07:43.896
His catchphrase is,
"Chance'd be a fine thing."

07:43.989 --> 07:45.739
- And it works with anything.
- It does. It does.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.316
Just say something to me.

07:47.451 --> 07:50.241
- All right, Lionel? What you up to today?
- No.

07:50.328 --> 07:52.538
Say, um, "All right, Lionel,
I'm just making some dinner.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.084
"Do you want something hot inside you?"

07:54.166 --> 07:55.166
Oh, hello.

07:55.292 --> 07:56.962
All right, Lionel,
I'm just making some dinner.

07:57.085 --> 08:00.585
- Fancy something hot inside you?
- Chance'd be a fine thing.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.300
All right, Lionel,
are you worried about AIDS?

08:04.384 --> 08:05.764
Don't say that.

08:05.886 --> 08:10.288
I got one, uh, character
called Dopey O'Leary. An Irishman.

08:10.348 --> 08:12.598
I like making people laugh.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.096
Sue me.

08:14.186 --> 08:16.896
I like making people feel,
more importantly.

08:16.980 --> 08:21.150
Comedy, music, poetry, philosophy,
whatever, you know.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.284
I get inside your head.

08:23.361 --> 08:24.741
Maybe get inside your heart.

08:24.821 --> 08:27.621
I got one character... called Ho Lee Fuk.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.491
- Ooh, no. Ooh, no!
- It's all right. It's not swearing.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.286
That's his name. He's a little Chinaman.

08:31.369 --> 08:32.369
Clever.

08:32.496 --> 08:34.312
Hello, my name's Ho Lee Fuk.

08:36.374 --> 08:39.634
I'm not weird-looking.
You're the weird-looking one.

08:39.753 --> 08:43.342
From the Chinaman's perspective,
at last, I flipped it.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.423
Oh, you fripped it.

08:44.549 --> 08:45.719
He's fripped it.

08:45.801 --> 08:47.931
- This is why we get on. Same level.
- Hang on a second.

08:48.011 --> 08:50.721
Can you fucking keep it down? Yeah.
Can you keep it down?

08:50.806 --> 08:53.636
- David? Can I have a word?
- Huh? Yeah.

08:53.767 --> 08:57.805
What you want? What you want? Sirry rady.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.020
I'm sure you didn't mean
to cause offence, David.

09:01.149 --> 09:05.343
But, as you know, we have to consider
everyone's feelings in the workplace.

09:05.403 --> 09:07.345
Yeah. Correctamundo.

09:07.405 --> 09:10.865
You're happy to propagate
a stereotype of Irish people

09:10.992 --> 09:13.351
being educationally subnormal

09:13.411 --> 09:15.353
or gay people being ridiculously camp?

09:15.413 --> 09:19.043
Well, I never actually specify
whether he is a homosexual or not.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.667
So that's in your mind.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.634
What about telling sexist jokes to women?

09:23.755 --> 09:25.835
Oh, you're saying I should only
tell them to men? Sexist.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.046
No. I'm saying
you shouldn't tell sexist jokes at all.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.368
Oh, okay.

09:30.428 --> 09:33.598
- You said something about bras?
- Yeah, just harmless fun.

09:33.682 --> 09:34.682
Go on.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.888
What's the definition of a glass bra?
Smash and grab. Honk, honk.

09:38.019 --> 09:40.229
Okay. Well, violence against women
is seldom a laughing matter.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.379
Where's the violence?

09:41.439 --> 09:44.609
You're smashing a woman's bra,
and then you're grabbing her breasts.

09:44.693 --> 09:47.863
Not literally. In a joke.
And the violence isn't the funny bit.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.908
What is the funny bit, David?

09:50.031 --> 09:52.390
Um, honk, honk.

09:52.450 --> 09:55.120
Funny noise, funny organs.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.496
So...

09:57.622 --> 10:00.672
Well, I don't think it warrants
any formal disciplinary action.

10:00.792 --> 10:01.922
- Shame.
- Uh...

10:02.836 --> 10:04.586
- It can be arranged.
- Oh.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.011
- But as I said, be aware...
- Hmm? I will.

10:07.090 --> 10:08.300
...and sensitive to difference.

10:08.425 --> 10:11.045
Ah, you'll see how sensitive
I am to difference.

10:11.136 --> 10:15.413
Get a cab then.
I'll pay you back when you get here.

10:15.473 --> 10:19.643
Because I need you to.
Trust me, it'll be fun.

10:19.728 --> 10:21.848
All right. Call when you get here.

10:21.938 --> 10:23.478
All right, cheers. Bye.

10:27.485 --> 10:28.855
So...

10:28.945 --> 10:32.025
Miriam is going to eat humble pie.

10:32.115 --> 10:34.405
Not the pie she's used to.

10:34.492 --> 10:36.952
I mean, she's slightly overweight
and likes apple pie.

10:37.078 --> 10:41.038
Not hairy pie. She's a lezzer. I mean...

10:41.124 --> 10:44.442
It's like having a 15-year-old kid
in the office, you know?

10:44.502 --> 10:46.722
Your lack of humour warning.

10:47.505 --> 10:50.296
And I find him an irritant. I mean,
normally I just shut my door when I hear him,

10:50.383 --> 10:52.683
because it's just...
It just puts me off my work.

10:53.511 --> 10:55.931
Where am I supposed to be?
I'm just, like, in reception.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.846
Here. I'm down here.

11:00.101 --> 11:01.941
- Flippin' hell.
- Come here.

11:02.062 --> 11:07.862
I was just in a meeting with, uh, Miriam.
It's, uh, my black friend.

11:07.943 --> 11:09.493
So,

11:09.569 --> 11:13.359
that's what I've been...
Mixed race, actually.

11:13.490 --> 11:14.472
My favourite.

11:14.532 --> 11:16.872
His dad was black, his mum was white.
Get over it.

11:16.952 --> 11:19.477
- My dad was white. My mum was black.
- Oh.

11:19.537 --> 11:21.497
Even more different. Her face.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.541
- Let's just not...
- I've been trying to say...

11:27.128 --> 11:28.498
I first met David...

11:28.588 --> 11:32.338
I was rapping in this open mic thing
in a pub in Slough.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.215
It's, you know, where we're both from.

11:34.344 --> 11:37.495
And he came over
and said he wanted to manage me.

11:37.555 --> 11:41.385
You know? I mean, I didn't know
at the time he was a sales rep.

11:42.394 --> 11:43.501
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

11:43.561 --> 11:45.151
- It's the only reason I'm here?
- Yeah.

11:45.230 --> 11:46.810
It's important. You off?

11:48.608 --> 11:49.938
It's just my mate.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.700
Going off on tour.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.516
- Him?
- Yeah.

11:58.576 --> 11:59.946
Okay.

12:00.036 --> 12:01.616
So, yeah.

12:01.746 --> 12:02.906
That's cool.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.131
Yeah.

12:08.586 --> 12:12.006
I've booked a session today
in a top-notch recording studio.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.531
- Hello?
- David.

12:15.593 --> 12:16.534
Here we go.

12:18.596 --> 12:20.538
Studio.

12:20.598 --> 12:23.428
I love making demos.
I do it a lot, you know.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.150
It not only gives the record company
an idea of what I can do.

12:26.229 --> 12:28.609
It gives me an idea of what I could do,
and that's the buzz.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.653
Dan. My usual engineer.

12:32.777 --> 12:35.737
Well I've done one session with Dom.
It was meant to be with Dom.

12:35.822 --> 12:40.032
It started off he was kind of
managing me and, um, he was paying

12:40.160 --> 12:42.560
for me to make my demos which was cool.
And then,

12:42.620 --> 12:45.080
suddenly, like,
he wanted to co-write songs

12:45.206 --> 12:49.536
and then before I knew it, he was, like,
doing his own songs and saying,

12:49.627 --> 12:51.497
"Oh, will you do a rap on this,
do a rap on that?"

12:51.629 --> 12:56.574
And now it's like some kind
of Ebony and Ivory, urban sidekick deal.

12:56.634 --> 12:58.576
Okay, I'm gonna cut the bullshit.

12:58.636 --> 13:01.176
- That would be great, yeah.
- I'm head-hunting.

13:01.264 --> 13:02.394
Putting a tour together.

13:02.474 --> 13:04.582
Do you wanna be part of that?
Drive the gang?

13:04.642 --> 13:06.522
On stage sound. Roadie.

13:06.644 --> 13:09.104
- What sort of tour?
- Showcasing the band.

13:09.230 --> 13:11.690
Also hotels, rider.

13:11.816 --> 13:14.646
So it's some work and some food
and somewhere to sleep?

13:15.403 --> 13:18.596
Here we go. Playing hardball. Yeah?

13:18.656 --> 13:21.486
- Are we talking bunse?
- Well we're certainly not talking English.

13:21.618 --> 13:24.288
- What do you earn here?
- That's not the issue.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.792
I'll double it.

13:26.831 --> 13:28.121
Really?

13:28.249 --> 13:29.829
I never dreamt he'd be on that much.

13:30.919 --> 13:33.209
It's a bit annoying.
It eats up the budget.

13:34.672 --> 13:38.616
But you pay people well, they wanna do
a good job and they wanna keep their job.

13:38.676 --> 13:41.346
So... I'll just cash in another pension.

13:41.471 --> 13:43.621
That's what I've been doing
to finance all this.

13:43.681 --> 13:47.311
I took out a lot of private pensions
in the '90s, you know.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.475
And some of them are worth
as much as I've put in now, so...

13:50.563 --> 13:52.273
And I would have spent that money by now.

13:52.357 --> 13:55.567
And now I am gonna spend it
on rock 'n' roll.

13:55.693 --> 13:57.363
But keep the drums sounding big though.

13:57.487 --> 13:59.907
David is... He's on-site.

14:00.031 --> 14:04.642
Deep down he's supporting me,
and I'm sure he'd love to see me do well.

14:04.702 --> 14:10.648
It's not a lot right now, but, you know,
see how this tour goes. Never know.

14:10.708 --> 14:13.288
There's a similarity there, you know.

14:13.378 --> 14:16.588
I mean, in some ways we're very alike.

14:16.714 --> 14:20.594
Except, you know, he's white and old
and his music is terrible.

14:20.718 --> 14:23.678
But, I mean, we're both just trying
to make it, you know,

14:23.763 --> 14:29.063
I'm just not...
not 100% sure what his "it" is.

14:38.361 --> 14:39.401
Bit of a cock-up.

14:39.529 --> 14:43.681
I've only got four days
actual holiday leave left.

14:43.741 --> 14:46.411
So I've gotta take 11 days unpaid.

14:46.536 --> 14:47.536
- Yeah.
- So...

14:47.620 --> 14:49.790
That's all right, you know, sort of.

14:49.914 --> 14:52.504
This is a holiday, isn't it?
It's what I love doing, so...

14:52.584 --> 14:54.214
And if I get signed,
it's all been worth it.

14:54.335 --> 14:57.695
Er, so my last day is next Friday.

14:57.755 --> 15:00.125
Yeah. Make sure your clients
are covered for the month

15:00.216 --> 15:01.699
and you're away.

15:01.759 --> 15:04.719
Yeah, I am indeed.

15:04.804 --> 15:05.934
- Back on the phones then.
- Yeah.

15:06.014 --> 15:07.934
Yeah. Back on the phone.

15:08.016 --> 15:09.216
It's daft.

15:09.350 --> 15:11.600
I mean, wasting his holiday
in trying to be a pop star.

15:11.728 --> 15:15.018
He'd be far better off, you know,
having a couple of weeks in Marbella.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.768
Relax, nice tan...

15:17.525 --> 15:19.815
Still, his money, his life, innit?

15:19.944 --> 15:21.574
- It's on. Yeah.
- Ooh.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.950
Uh...

15:24.032 --> 15:27.412
My last week, next week. Then I'm off.

15:27.535 --> 15:32.455
Got a few more... gigs to book in.

15:32.582 --> 15:34.732
Get the record companies down, get signed.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.712
Bye-bye nine to five.

15:36.794 --> 15:38.736
Sorry.

15:38.796 --> 15:41.336
No. So, rehearsal tomorrow.

15:41.424 --> 15:42.740
Wait till you see the band.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.590
Great bunch of kids.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.547
Foregone Conclusion, Mark ll.

15:48.056 --> 15:52.226
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.392
I did try and get
the old crew back together,

15:54.479 --> 15:58.069
but, um, they hadn't really weathered
as well as me.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.685
Reggie Mental.

16:00.818 --> 16:03.358
He can't drum any more. His back's gone.

16:03.446 --> 16:06.736
He's on painkillers
and physio, permanently, you know.

16:06.824 --> 16:08.874
He's basically an invalid now.

16:09.827 --> 16:10.867
From that.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.377
Jack.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.631
He's married now with four kids.
Look at him there.

16:18.628 --> 16:19.777
Under the thumb.

16:19.837 --> 16:22.780
I bumped into him in Reading,
down the Oracle.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.590
And he was shopping with his wife,
holding hands with kids,

16:25.677 --> 16:28.177
carrying shopping,
papoose with a new baby in it.

16:28.263 --> 16:29.473
And he looked at me,

16:29.597 --> 16:32.807
and he didn't literally say it out loud,
because his wife was there,

16:32.892 --> 16:36.522
but I could see in his eyes,
he was saying, "Kill me."

16:38.022 --> 16:39.192
From that.

16:41.234 --> 16:44.244
And the saddest of all... Mammogram.

16:45.488 --> 16:47.068
Real name, Craig Monkford.

16:47.198 --> 16:50.198
Wow, great guy. Brilliant guitarist.

16:50.285 --> 16:53.811
Life and soul of the party.
And he knew how to party.

16:53.871 --> 16:55.041
His nickname is from the fact

16:55.123 --> 16:59.133
that he'd always turn up to your door
with a different girl with big boobs.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.819
So, nothing to do with cancer, um...

17:01.879 --> 17:06.839
But he is now doing two years
for 11 different counts of sexual assault.

17:08.553 --> 17:10.723
Hiya.

17:16.144 --> 17:18.904
Saturday, innit? So...

17:20.147 --> 17:23.147
Rehearsals.
Yeah, this is where it all happens.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.843
This is the last one, actually,
before the tour.

17:25.903 --> 17:27.323
That's all booked.

17:27.446 --> 17:30.277
Well, I got six or seven gigs in.

17:30.366 --> 17:32.906
Still a few gaps. I'll be filling those.

17:33.036 --> 17:35.286
There are guys here
looking for opportunities.

17:35.371 --> 17:36.831
Um...

17:36.914 --> 17:39.674
If not, I'll have a day off.

17:39.751 --> 17:42.961
That always helps with the old tonsils.

17:43.087 --> 17:44.087
So...

17:45.923 --> 17:47.053
Anyway...

17:48.051 --> 17:50.931
Keep the noise down. Nah, turn it up.

17:52.930 --> 17:54.140
Let's rock.

17:54.265 --> 17:57.875
Yeah, boom, that's perfect.
And then, like, eight bars of this. Yeah?

17:57.935 --> 18:00.395
Whassup?

18:00.521 --> 18:03.151
Come on, let's do some work now then.

18:03.941 --> 18:07.151
Here's the band.
Foregone Conclusion, Mark ll.

18:07.278 --> 18:10.818
- He's not in it. He's just, you know...
- We're just gonna, um, finish this.

18:10.948 --> 18:12.890
Yeah, let's do some...
Let's do some... You know him.

18:12.950 --> 18:16.290
Look. He's already at work.
I gave him the gig.

18:17.205 --> 18:18.825
Stu Monkford.

18:19.749 --> 18:21.899
Mammogram's nephew
I was telling you about.

18:21.959 --> 18:24.169
What do you call a bloke
who hangs round with musicians?

18:24.295 --> 18:26.405
The drummer.

18:27.131 --> 18:31.891
Andy. We have got Mike and Steve.
They're brothers.

18:31.969 --> 18:34.912
Don't look alike, do they?
The beard's different.

18:34.972 --> 18:38.916
I guess like with most session musicians,
you get, like, a call...

18:38.976 --> 18:42.226
gets put in to your agent,
and they, um, you know, say,

18:42.355 --> 18:44.895
"Are you available?
Is it something you actually wanna do?"

18:44.982 --> 18:47.925
Um, in this case, not particularly,

18:47.985 --> 18:49.895
but at the same time, you know,
you go where the money goes

18:49.987 --> 18:53.931
because you can't ever guarantee
when the next lot of work's gonna come in.

18:53.991 --> 18:57.408
For us, it's just, you know, we're out,
and we're getting paid, and we're playing.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.827
Let's do it. Let's rock.

18:58.955 --> 19:02.115
What shall we do? Let's do, um, Ooh La La.

19:03.835 --> 19:05.943
- I'm not in that one.
- He's not in this one.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.383
Starts with an acoustic.

19:15.638 --> 19:18.138
# Sold my shack in Memphis

19:19.350 --> 19:22.020
# Bought me a Chevrolet

19:23.020 --> 19:26.020
# Six string in the back
And a bottle of Jack

19:26.149 --> 19:30.239
# And I headed down to Mexico Way

19:30.361 --> 19:33.971
# Singing ooh la la la

19:34.031 --> 19:37.975
# Ooh la la la la lay

19:38.035 --> 19:42.285
# Ooh la la la la la la la

19:42.415 --> 19:45.075
# It's a beautiful day #

19:49.922 --> 19:52.052
Okay. Let's do it.

19:53.050 --> 19:54.220
I'll send a cheque over.

19:54.302 --> 19:55.993
I've been putting
all the gigs in, you know.

19:56.053 --> 19:58.996
Hopefully I'll get
a solid three-week block.

19:59.056 --> 20:00.998
I'll get to work on it, promoting it.

20:01.058 --> 20:04.188
That we can build, and get A&R along.

20:05.062 --> 20:07.652
Um, but, you know, the...
the tour's shaping up.

20:07.732 --> 20:09.482
I'm the artist and the manager.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.109
I have to book the hotels.

20:11.235 --> 20:14.985
The old credit card has taken
a bit of a hammering.

20:15.072 --> 20:16.412
My flexible friend.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.041
Yeah, um...

20:25.082 --> 20:26.672
They're gonna be gutted when I'm gone.

20:26.751 --> 20:30.881
But at the same time,
they know it's what I want and deserve.

20:30.963 --> 20:35.263
Hence, they're gonna be happy for me.
So, mixed emotions.

20:35.343 --> 20:40.643
Right, I better say goodbye to everyone
before I... jet off.

20:40.723 --> 20:43.683
Um, I hope they haven't made a big fuss.

20:43.768 --> 20:45.848
You know what I mean?
It's not like I'm going forever.

20:45.937 --> 20:48.357
Even if I get signed,
I'm gonna pop in. But...

20:48.481 --> 20:49.561
Oh...

20:51.108 --> 20:53.238
See you later, guys. I'm off on tour.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.949
Keep selling. Where's Nigel?

20:55.071 --> 20:57.661
- He's out selling.
- Is he?

20:58.533 --> 20:59.703
- Is he really?
- Yeah.

20:59.784 --> 21:01.584
- Where is he?
- Maidenhead.

21:01.702 --> 21:04.162
All right. Good.

21:04.288 --> 21:07.998
Ah, thought so. You...

21:08.125 --> 21:10.165
We did this to Pete Gibbons.

21:10.294 --> 21:11.554
He thought we hadn't done anything,

21:11.671 --> 21:15.072
and we got a massive whip-round going,
and we, um, we got him a...

21:15.132 --> 21:17.722
"Break a leg, Pauline."
It is just from you, is it?

21:17.802 --> 21:19.342
- Yeah.
- All right.

21:19.470 --> 21:21.720
It's exciting, really, for him.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.021
The office is gonna be a bit quiet

21:24.141 --> 21:26.521
which is gonna be a shame.

21:26.602 --> 21:28.062
Brings a little sparkle.

21:28.145 --> 21:30.087
- Is he really out selling?
- Yeah.

21:30.147 --> 21:31.897
- Is he?
- Yeah.

21:36.153 --> 21:38.783
When he walks in,
you don't know what he's gonna say,

21:38.906 --> 21:42.076
and... he does brighten up
my day a little bit.

21:42.159 --> 21:43.100
Is Nigel out selling?

21:43.160 --> 21:44.910
He might try to be funny,

21:44.996 --> 21:49.106
and not... maybe people
don't find him funny, but I do.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.746
Right. That's 'cause I said to him
I don't want a fuss, so he went...

21:52.837 --> 21:54.167
So he didn't, er...

21:55.590 --> 21:57.970
First gig, Monday.

21:59.176 --> 22:00.296
Have a nice time.

22:00.386 --> 22:03.176
Yeah. Right.

22:08.185 --> 22:09.185
See you.

22:12.189 --> 22:13.319
Oh...

22:13.399 --> 22:15.149
- See you later.
- Bye.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.194
Bye. Bye.

22:34.545 --> 22:38.665
This isn't like, you know,
when I left Wernham Hogg.

22:38.799 --> 22:42.969
I was the head of that family.
A lot more emotional for everyone.

22:43.888 --> 22:47.768
Being made redundant,
and the whole fame thing,

22:47.850 --> 22:49.100
that got to me a bit.

22:50.227 --> 22:51.847
I had a nervous breakdown.

22:51.979 --> 22:58.569
I spent a little bit of time in a...
a facility.

22:59.236 --> 23:01.178
Voluntary, you know.

23:01.238 --> 23:03.408
But, nah, not for me.

23:03.491 --> 23:06.281
I practice the ancient medical art
of "bloody pull yourself together, mate".

23:07.578 --> 23:10.908
So, I was on Prozac for about six months.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.254
Er, ballooned up to about 16 stone
at one point.

23:14.377 --> 23:15.707
I'd given up.

23:15.836 --> 23:19.506
The lads started calling me
Brentasaurus. All good fun.

23:19.632 --> 23:23.472
Not at the time. I burst into tears...
and wanted to kill myself.

23:24.679 --> 23:27.009
But I turned it round, you know.

23:27.890 --> 23:28.930
Got fit.

23:30.393 --> 23:31.813
Inside and out.

23:31.894 --> 23:33.024
- Hi.
- Hi, David.

23:33.104 --> 23:34.104
Hi, Sandra.

23:34.230 --> 23:36.060
And I found myself again, you know,

23:36.148 --> 23:39.688
and I started to do what I do best,
entertain.

23:39.819 --> 23:42.489
Triple threat. Music, comedy, wisdom.

23:42.613 --> 23:44.823
- Would you like to go out for a coffee?
- No.

23:46.283 --> 23:47.873
- She is mental, isn't she?
- Well...

23:47.952 --> 23:49.242
A proper loon. A dead bee.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.118
- How are you?
- Brilliant. Never felt better.

23:52.248 --> 23:56.233
Happiest I've been, probably,
doing these sessions with a professional.

23:56.293 --> 23:57.923
Now I decided to sort everything out.

23:58.045 --> 24:01.455
Body, mind, and spirit. I've done that,
so... I'm empowered now.

24:01.549 --> 24:04.259
Power in the, not the political sense,
or, you know...

24:04.343 --> 24:06.433
but I mean, inner strength.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.245
That's what I think it is.
Mind power, really, isn't it?

24:08.305 --> 24:10.265
It's willpower, um...

24:10.349 --> 24:14.439
And, uh, you know, am I a free willist?
I'm a do-as-thou-willist.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.310
So, it does make...
It makes sense up there...

24:16.439 --> 24:17.439
- David...
- Go on.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.691
- Have you had the dream again?
- No.

24:22.319 --> 24:23.319
No.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.790
So what do you wanna talk about? Shoot.

24:31.912 --> 24:33.270
- Don't read anything into that.
- Okay...

24:33.330 --> 24:35.500
No, I just thought...
When I said it, I thought of...

24:35.583 --> 24:36.583
Don't matter.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.963
Okay, um...
So what do you want to talk about?

24:40.087 --> 24:42.127
- That's what we're here for, so...
- The band.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.344
- The band? Of course. Okay.
- Yeah.

24:43.466 --> 24:45.282
- Tell me about the band.
- That's what's happening.

24:45.342 --> 24:47.762
- Yeah?
- We're going on tour. Great bunch of guys.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.347
And we're... I've booked some gigs.

24:50.473 --> 24:52.353
Taken the time off work,

24:52.475 --> 24:56.305
and gonna get A&R people along,
get signed, put an album out.

24:56.395 --> 24:58.185
- Mmm-hmm. Can I ask you a question?
- Go on.

24:58.314 --> 25:00.024
What happens
if you don't get a record deal?

25:00.149 --> 25:02.569
- Failure is not an option.
- Well, it is, David, isn't it?

25:04.904 --> 25:07.954
She's meant to big me up...
make me feel better.

25:08.032 --> 25:11.032
But it's all like,
"Oh, what if you fail? Be prepared."

25:11.160 --> 25:13.750
What a downer.
She doesn't mind me throwing money at her.

25:13.829 --> 25:16.579
At least I enjoy my music.
Do you know what I mean?

25:16.707 --> 25:18.247
She makes me nervous.
She's always writing notes.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.325
And I'm thinking, "What's she writing?"

25:19.418 --> 25:22.168
She could write anything.
"He's a pervert. He's a loser."

25:22.254 --> 25:23.924
Gives me the creeps to be honest...

25:24.006 --> 25:25.916
Next week, yeah. See you later.

25:26.008 --> 25:27.258
Bye.

25:30.638 --> 25:31.968
That's the tour outfit.

25:32.848 --> 25:35.428
I try to incorporate
all my influences there, really.

25:35.559 --> 25:37.939
It's a bit new romantic but modern.

25:38.020 --> 25:41.400
A bit Bublé. A bit David Essex.

25:43.359 --> 25:44.569
We're nearly there.

25:45.402 --> 25:47.402
Off on tour. Getting everything ready.

25:47.530 --> 25:50.570
Yeah, I get a sort of adrenaline rush
when I think about it.

25:50.658 --> 25:54.408
And that's not fear.
That's like, "Let's do this."

26:00.167 --> 26:02.247
Let's book a string of gigs.

26:02.378 --> 26:04.878
Book a tour bus. Beautiful tour bus.

26:05.005 --> 26:07.364
Top-of-the-range. State-of-the-art.

26:07.424 --> 26:09.264
Air-conditioning, bunks.

26:09.385 --> 26:11.425
It's like a party on wheels.

26:12.429 --> 26:14.429
Oh God, I hope we get some sleep.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.375
I'm up and down the country
all the time, you know.

26:18.435 --> 26:21.055
On the road is where I really come alive.

26:21.188 --> 26:24.478
So, just swapping the old Insignia
for the tour bus.

26:25.442 --> 26:27.442
Here we go!

26:28.445 --> 26:29.645
Oh...

26:32.074 --> 26:35.794
Whassup?

26:37.830 --> 26:39.370
See you later.

26:39.456 --> 26:40.866
Ah...

26:42.793 --> 26:44.401
There's not a lot of room on there,

26:44.461 --> 26:47.051
so we think it's better I follow behind.

26:47.131 --> 26:49.011
Good idea, in a way.

26:50.050 --> 26:51.430
Whassup...

27:00.436 --> 27:02.226
Quite expensive, that bus.

27:02.313 --> 27:04.483
So, I think they'll enjoy it.

27:05.274 --> 27:09.824
No, it's right that the lead singer
gets his own vehicle.

27:09.904 --> 27:12.164
I think they're thinking of me...

27:12.281 --> 27:16.281
If my headspace is right,
then the performance is better.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.488
Clever.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.892
Hotel.

27:38.057 --> 27:41.557
Oh, life on the road. Love it.

27:41.685 --> 27:42.975
It's all here.

27:44.521 --> 27:48.481
Tea, coffee, TV, bed.

27:49.652 --> 27:51.192
Just wanna sit down.

27:52.363 --> 27:54.783
Desk, mirror.

28:02.539 --> 28:03.669
Look at that.

28:12.549 --> 28:13.719
It's all here.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.547
Ah, all right.

28:17.554 --> 28:18.554
Sound check.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.518
I love sound checks.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.191
Checking all the sound and...

28:25.312 --> 28:26.562
I love being backstage.

28:27.982 --> 28:31.442
And the band have insisted
I have my own dressing room, which is...

28:31.568 --> 28:32.528
Yeah.

28:32.611 --> 28:33.991
So, yeah.

28:36.573 --> 28:38.163
Oh, my days.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.042
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

28:42.997 --> 28:44.537
Let's go and say hello.

28:54.925 --> 28:56.125
Drugs raid!

28:58.345 --> 28:59.536
Your faces...

29:01.390 --> 29:02.930
No.

29:03.017 --> 29:04.637
They don't do drugs.

29:05.728 --> 29:09.608
Unless you count alcohol.
That is a drug, innit? So...

29:10.482 --> 29:13.822
That's what makes me laugh,
all this, "Ban marijuana."

29:13.944 --> 29:14.994
Shut up.

29:15.070 --> 29:17.860
Ban it? Why? It's a drug, yeah?

29:17.990 --> 29:19.620
So is your white wine.

29:24.079 --> 29:25.459
Just a bit of weed.

29:27.082 --> 29:29.212
Likkle bit of herb, innit?

29:33.088 --> 29:35.572
- What, you just chilling out?
- Yeah.

29:35.632 --> 29:36.842
Don't blame you.

29:37.634 --> 29:38.844
I think I'm gonna go and...

29:39.803 --> 29:40.803
See you later.

29:48.645 --> 29:50.095
That's bad, innit?

29:52.649 --> 29:53.649
- Do you wanna close it?
- Huh?

29:53.776 --> 29:55.436
- Just close the door.
- Yeah.

29:56.612 --> 29:58.202
That needs oiling.

30:04.787 --> 30:06.037
Can we get a bit of bass?

30:06.830 --> 30:08.120
Two.

30:08.248 --> 30:10.118
Two. One, two.

30:10.250 --> 30:12.420
One, two. Oh!

30:12.503 --> 30:14.673
Oh, yeah.

30:16.465 --> 30:18.585
Yeah! Let's go and get some beers.

30:18.675 --> 30:20.617
You might as well stay up there,
as you're on in two minutes.

30:20.677 --> 30:21.618
Really?

30:21.678 --> 30:23.678
- When do they open the doors?
- They're open.

30:23.806 --> 30:26.056
No one's come through
to see the first band on.

30:26.141 --> 30:28.141
For... We, uh...

30:28.685 --> 30:30.845
Well, can you tell them
they can come in for free?

30:30.938 --> 30:33.818
- Well, you won't make any money, then.
- I know, but we want a crowd, don't we?

30:33.899 --> 30:35.019
All right.

30:36.693 --> 30:38.613
Oh, God.

30:38.695 --> 30:41.525
I haven't even time
to change into my stage gear.

30:43.534 --> 30:46.164
It's good that I'm always
sort of dressed for rock, isn't it?

30:47.704 --> 30:49.874
- Double denim?
- Yeah.

30:49.957 --> 30:52.247
- I never double denim.
- Always double denim.

30:53.127 --> 30:54.707
Here they come. Come on in.

30:54.837 --> 30:58.457
Welcome to Foregone Conclusion, Mark ll.

30:58.549 --> 31:01.719
Not the original band. Um, long story.

31:01.844 --> 31:03.660
Little bit of trivia though.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.260
Mammogram's nephew, Stu Monkford.

31:06.348 --> 31:10.388
Yeah. Got all his uncle's skills.
Not the sexual assault.

31:11.145 --> 31:13.475
He hasn't any... Not yet, anyway.

31:13.564 --> 31:15.864
His uncle didn't start till he was 40,
which is weird.

31:15.941 --> 31:19.991
But as of now,
this dude has not raped anyone.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.740
Just do the songs, David.

31:25.909 --> 31:29.499
# Sold my shack in Memphis

31:29.580 --> 31:32.330
# Bought me a Chevrolet

31:33.208 --> 31:36.693
# Six string in the back
And a bottle of Jack

31:36.753 --> 31:40.013
# And I headed down to Mexico way

31:40.132 --> 31:43.592
# Singing ooh la la la

31:44.386 --> 31:47.506
# Ooh la la la la lay

31:48.223 --> 31:52.443
# Ooh la la la la la la la

31:52.561 --> 31:54.651
# It's a beautiful day #

31:56.773 --> 31:58.403
Guitar solo.

32:01.778 --> 32:02.778
Back to back.

32:16.919 --> 32:19.209
He went down. Tried to style it out.

32:21.048 --> 32:22.168
Just can't believe it.

32:28.805 --> 32:31.635
- I fell over.
- Yeah, I know.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.427
- Do you think they noticed?
- Yes.

32:34.937 --> 32:37.057
I'm spending three weeks of my life
on tour with this guy.

32:53.664 --> 32:54.771
Here we go again.

32:54.831 --> 32:58.381
# I work so hard
Just to pay my bills

33:02.422 --> 33:06.052
# I play even harder
Yeah, life kills

33:10.222 --> 33:14.732
# Now I'm burnin' rubber on the M25

33:16.853 --> 33:19.403
# Got a crazy weekend

33:19.481 --> 33:22.861
# Some of us won't make it out alive

33:24.611 --> 33:26.741
# 'Cause this is my day

33:28.282 --> 33:30.282
# Thank fuck it's Friday #

33:32.578 --> 33:36.328
"I was worried about this tour,"
he admits.

33:36.456 --> 33:38.866
Yeah. "What if it's a failure?
What if no one comes?

33:39.001 --> 33:40.817
- "What if I haven't got what it takes?"
- Yeah.

33:40.877 --> 33:46.667
And then, the ghost of Alexander O'Neal
visited me in a dream one night,

33:46.758 --> 33:51.758
and said, "You have got what it takes,
and you owe it to the world to do this."

33:51.888 --> 33:52.829
So...

33:52.889 --> 33:55.099
But you know that was just
you thinking that, don't you?

33:55.225 --> 33:56.265
I was dreaming it.

33:56.351 --> 33:59.836
Well, either way, the ghost
of Alexander O'Neal didn't really come.

33:59.896 --> 34:02.839
Hang on, Alexander O'Neal
isn't even dead, is he?

34:02.899 --> 34:04.819
- Luther Vandross.
- Oh, okay.

34:04.901 --> 34:07.571
It was Luther Vandross, not Alexander,
who is dead,

34:07.696 --> 34:10.106
and one of the best
soul singers that's ever lived.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.239
Or am I...

34:12.743 --> 34:13.833
No, he's good.

34:13.909 --> 34:15.699
- He's good.
- Ooh, from the horse's mouth.

34:16.913 --> 34:17.853
So...

34:17.914 --> 34:19.856
Okay, and did Luther
give you any other advice?

34:19.916 --> 34:21.956
Did he talk about what it was costing?

34:22.085 --> 34:25.755
- Did he...
- No, he just said it's gonna keep going.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.864
So I think that means
this tour is gonna get better and better.

34:28.925 --> 34:30.867
- It's not really a tour, though, is it?
- Well...

34:30.927 --> 34:34.056
It's like seven or eight random gigs
over a three-week period.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.349
Well, I couldn't fill all the dates.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.684
But I'm gonna use that time
to create a buzz.

34:37.768 --> 34:40.308
It's about...
It's the whole package with me.

34:40.395 --> 34:43.725
Yeah, but this tour of yours
is over such a contained area

34:43.815 --> 34:45.882
that we end up staying in these hotels,

34:45.942 --> 34:47.884
and you could just drive to each gig.

34:47.944 --> 34:49.404
You know, last night,

34:49.529 --> 34:53.409
the drive from the gig to this hotel
was further than it was to your house.

34:53.533 --> 34:55.413
That's the whole package.
That's what I'm talking about.

34:55.534 --> 34:57.785
Okay, and do you know how many tickets
we've sold for the next gig?

34:57.913 --> 35:00.413
- Do you wanna have a guess?
- Not many. But don't worry about that,

35:00.540 --> 35:05.630
because I've secured an interview
on a radio station to sort all that out.

35:05.754 --> 35:07.554
- Radio 1?
- No.

35:07.631 --> 35:09.591
- Absolute?
- No.

35:09.716 --> 35:10.907
- Is it Capital...
- Tadley FM.

35:10.967 --> 35:15.717
# I lost my heart to a lady gypsy

35:15.806 --> 35:19.636
# So long ago I forget her name

35:19.768 --> 35:24.808
# But I still remember
The smell of the flowers

35:24.940 --> 35:29.990
# And the way my life
Would never be the same #

35:32.863 --> 35:33.930
Okay.

35:33.990 --> 35:37.620
That was Lady Gypsy
by the chap sitting in front of me.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.937
Now, you've never heard that track before
because it's never been released.

35:40.997 --> 35:43.747
And it's never been released
because he doesn't have a record deal.

35:43.834 --> 35:46.714
Mmm, who could that be?

35:46.795 --> 35:48.915
Well, you've probably never heard of him.

35:49.005 --> 35:51.545
But, uh, stars from reality TV shows,

35:51.633 --> 35:54.723
such as Made In Chelsea
and The Only Way Is Essex,

35:54.803 --> 35:56.763
they're household names these days.

35:56.847 --> 36:00.807
But I am sitting with one
of the original docu-soap stars,

36:00.934 --> 36:02.854
- David Brent.
- Hello.

36:02.978 --> 36:05.348
Now, for our listeners
who've completely forgotten who you are,

36:05.439 --> 36:08.229
which I certainly have. My bad. Sorry.

36:08.358 --> 36:11.938
Or who weren't even born
when The Office was on TV.

36:12.028 --> 36:13.970
You were part of a BBC Two documentary

36:14.030 --> 36:16.780
that followed the life
of a paper merchant in Slough,

36:16.867 --> 36:18.737
- called Wernham Hogg.
- Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

36:18.827 --> 36:21.577
It was a bit like The Call Centre,
and you were a Neville of its day.

36:21.663 --> 36:23.043
Well, I was the regional manager...

36:23.165 --> 36:25.165
And how did it feel when people
were just walking around, going,

36:25.250 --> 36:28.985
"Oh, my God, that manager,
he's such an... idiot"?

36:29.045 --> 36:30.125
Well, you know...

36:30.213 --> 36:31.988
- Didn't care?
- No, because...

36:32.048 --> 36:34.128
- You weren't embarrassed?
- No, 'cause not everyone was saying that...

36:34.217 --> 36:35.587
Not even a little bit? Quite embarrassing.

36:35.677 --> 36:37.467
No, because a lot of people
thought it was very entertaining...

36:37.596 --> 36:39.996
- Yeah, we love a loser, don't we?
- Yeah...

36:40.056 --> 36:42.056
Well, anyway, so you're back,
and you're giving it another go.

36:42.142 --> 36:44.142
Are you hoping to change
people's opinions of you this time?

36:44.227 --> 36:45.847
- I'm not doing that any more...
- I'll tell you what.

36:45.979 --> 36:48.859
Seeing as you're here,
can we just play "Sausage or Pie"?

36:48.982 --> 36:50.862
- What is that?
- Uh, we play it with all of our guests.

36:50.984 --> 36:56.012
Basically, I say a manufacturer's name,
and you tell me if it's a sausage or a pie.

36:56.072 --> 36:57.412
- Right. Okay.
- Okay?

36:57.491 --> 37:00.016
Now, you've got seven to knock
Christopher Biggins off the top spot.

37:00.076 --> 37:04.786
Now that guy really knows his sausages
and his pies!

37:04.873 --> 37:06.623
- Okay.
- Okay!

37:06.708 --> 37:09.025
- You ready? Pukka?
- Yeah. Okay.

37:09.085 --> 37:11.295
No, that's wrong. I gotta take
your first answer. It's actually...

37:11.421 --> 37:13.421
I didn't know it was a question.
I thought it was...

37:13.507 --> 37:14.917
- Fray Bentos?
- Pie.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.880
Very good. Johnsonville?

37:17.010 --> 37:18.430
- Pie.
- Wrong.

37:18.512 --> 37:20.222
It's a sausage. Sorry.
The clue was in the title, mate.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.005
Right. Okay.

37:22.098 --> 37:24.268
You're level with Todd Carty.
Okay. Wing Wah?

37:24.392 --> 37:25.852
- Pie.
- Sausage again.

37:25.936 --> 37:28.476
- I'm sorry...
- Where did you get him from?

37:28.605 --> 37:30.815
- I thought he'd be good at this.
- No, it's just that it's not...

37:30.899 --> 37:32.189
Oh, we're out of time, I'm afraid.

37:32.275 --> 37:34.025
So, I didn't even mention the gig.

37:34.110 --> 37:35.440
And that was the whole point
of doing this.

37:35.529 --> 37:37.109
Sixteen tickets sold.

37:37.239 --> 37:38.409
Waste of time.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.124
And you only got one point
on "Sausage or Pie".

37:41.243 --> 37:43.243
I don't care about that shit!

37:45.872 --> 37:49.712
People often say to me, they say,
"Oi, Brent, you're a philosopher.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.335
"You're a leader of men.

37:51.461 --> 37:53.461
"You're a great comedic mind.

37:53.547 --> 37:55.627
"But is there anything
you won't joke about?"

37:55.715 --> 37:58.074
And I always say, "Yes, the handicapped".

37:58.134 --> 38:02.078
So I will not laugh at them.

38:02.138 --> 38:05.268
Or with them, just to be sure.

38:05.350 --> 38:06.980
Also, you might get in trouble.

38:07.102 --> 38:09.085
And that's in this.
It's sort of a warning.

38:09.145 --> 38:12.355
Part of the problem
is the fact that he explains

38:12.482 --> 38:14.942
- every single lyric.
- Every single lyric.

38:15.068 --> 38:17.068
- We can't just play a song.
- Which... No.

38:17.153 --> 38:18.493
They don't really
need explaining, do they?

38:18.572 --> 38:21.532
And we have to sit there
with our instruments,

38:21.658 --> 38:24.158
- waiting for the song to start.
- Yeah, it's...

38:24.744 --> 38:27.103
- That's so... Yea.
- It's excruciating.

38:27.163 --> 38:33.383
# Oh, please don't make fun
Of the disableds

38:34.588 --> 38:38.168
# There's nothing funny about those

38:39.593 --> 38:42.803
# Whether mental in the head

38:42.929 --> 38:45.559
# Or mental in the legs

38:45.682 --> 38:47.472
We've been in a lot of bands together,

38:47.559 --> 38:52.149
and I'd say David is, sort of,
the personification of...

38:53.148 --> 38:57.358
all of our most embarrassing moments ever,
being in bands...

38:57.485 --> 38:59.105
Yeah.

38:59.195 --> 39:01.315
- ...magnified by about a hundred.
- Yeah.

39:05.952 --> 39:11.752
# Please be kind
To the ones with feeble minds

39:11.833 --> 39:16.923
# Help the awkward through a door

39:17.797 --> 39:20.156
# Hold their hand

39:20.216 --> 39:23.216
# If they've got one, understand

39:23.345 --> 39:26.595
# You might have to feed

39:26.723 --> 39:28.853
# The worst ones

39:28.975 --> 39:32.345
# Through a straw

39:32.437 --> 39:35.171
# It's basically a head on a pillow

39:35.231 --> 39:39.031
# Head on a pillow
Head on a pillow

39:39.152 --> 39:44.242
# Oh, please don't make fun
Of the disabled

39:46.451 --> 39:50.041
# There's nothing funny about those

39:52.040 --> 39:54.210
# Whether mental in the head

39:54.876 --> 39:58.046
# Or mental in the legs

39:58.171 --> 40:02.261
# Doesn't mean their sorrow doesn't show

40:03.218 --> 40:06.178
# Oh, no, no, no

40:08.264 --> 40:11.484
# Oh, no, no, no #

40:18.900 --> 40:20.280
It's for that little guy there.

40:20.402 --> 40:22.282
Well done. Welcome.

40:26.866 --> 40:30.226
No one's coming to the gigs.
Fundamentally, that's the main problem.

40:30.286 --> 40:32.286
David's idea of problem solving,

40:33.039 --> 40:35.079
is just to throw more money at it.

40:36.292 --> 40:37.842
I don't know what to do with him.

40:38.253 --> 40:40.923
Speculate to accumulate. It's business.

40:41.047 --> 40:45.087
I'm thinking of spending more money
'cause it's so worth it.

40:45.218 --> 40:48.888
- But if no one's coming to the gigs...
- I'll get people to come to the gig.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.434
I'll pay someone to get people
to come to the gig. I will... PR.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.517
This is like Brewster's Millions.

40:54.644 --> 40:57.154
That's what I'm gonna do next. Get a PR.

40:57.272 --> 40:58.312
- Can you do cash?
- Yes.

40:58.398 --> 41:00.318
- Cash in hand?
- Like this.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.820
What sort of stuff you looking for, then?

41:01.901 --> 41:05.321
Radio interviews, press interviews,
profile pieces.

41:05.405 --> 41:07.263
First of all, let's get you noticed.

41:07.323 --> 41:08.743
Yeah.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.447
- Image. Sex.
- Yeah.

41:12.162 --> 41:13.502
- Publicity shots.
- Let's do it.

41:13.621 --> 41:16.541
- Do you know any good photographers?
- It'll cost you if you want a real one.

41:50.700 --> 41:53.580
- Yeah? What do you think?
- Oh, it's all so old-fashioned.

41:53.703 --> 41:56.123
- What do you mean?
- Take your shirt off. Be like Beckham.

41:56.206 --> 41:57.366
Okay.

41:59.334 --> 42:02.094
- Oh, no, that's awful.
- What?

42:02.170 --> 42:03.500
When was the last time
you shaved your back?

42:03.588 --> 42:04.958
About a week ago.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.090
You haven't even got any tattoos.

42:08.384 --> 42:11.327
Yeah, I've been thinking about
getting a tattoo for bloody years.

42:11.387 --> 42:13.097
Um, but when you're the office manager,

42:13.181 --> 42:14.561
or representing
a cleaning products company,

42:14.682 --> 42:16.812
you've got to present a certain image.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.975
So I give them the squeaky-clean image.

42:19.104 --> 42:21.314
If they saw me at the weekend,
they'd blow a fuse.

42:24.984 --> 42:26.534
Yeah.

42:26.611 --> 42:30.111
I was gonna have "Slough,"
um, but that didn't tell the whole story.

42:30.198 --> 42:33.778
'Cause originally I'm from Reading,
and I didn't wanna piss off that crew.

42:33.910 --> 42:35.790
Likewise, I didn't wanna have "Reading"

42:35.912 --> 42:39.582
because, uh, the Slough posse
would be like, "Oh, you traitor".

42:39.707 --> 42:42.497
So, um, yeah, I went with something
that's sort of all-encompassing,

42:42.585 --> 42:45.915
um, to show the scope
of what I'm trying to do.

42:46.005 --> 42:47.335
Sky is the limit.

42:47.423 --> 42:51.433
Uh, I went with "Berkshire".
You know, keep everyone happy.

42:52.554 --> 42:57.434
But, uh, I'm not good...
with needles or pain.

42:57.517 --> 43:00.187
It is painful. It is painful.

43:00.270 --> 43:02.020
Are you nearly done?

43:02.147 --> 43:04.517
- About halfway.
- Halfway? Come on.

43:04.607 --> 43:06.382
- Do you wanna see it?
- Nah.

43:06.442 --> 43:08.032
- Go on. Have a look.
- No, no, no. Just do it.

43:08.153 --> 43:09.385
- Just see if you like it.
- I will like it.

43:09.445 --> 43:12.655
Just... I'm just saying,
just finish it, and let's, um...

43:12.782 --> 43:15.452
Oh, what's that? Is that blood?

43:16.536 --> 43:17.786
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:17.871 --> 43:19.791
Easy, fella. Easy. Sonia, give us a hand.

43:19.873 --> 43:20.873
Haresh.

43:23.668 --> 43:26.248
- I said I didn't wanna look, didn't I?
- All right.

43:30.466 --> 43:31.756
Have some water.

43:36.598 --> 43:38.388
That's it. I'm not doing any more.

43:38.474 --> 43:39.774
- No, no. Come on. We'll finish it up.
- No, no, no.

43:39.851 --> 43:41.417
No, that's it.
No, we're not gonna finish it up.

43:41.477 --> 43:42.847
At least let me clean it for you.

43:42.979 --> 43:45.421
I said I didn't wanna look, you
made me look, and that's what happens.

43:45.481 --> 43:47.321
I'll get a plaster on that.

43:53.656 --> 43:55.486
It's good, innit?

43:56.201 --> 43:57.433
That's there forever.

43:57.493 --> 43:59.083
"You got any tattoos, David?" "Yeah."

43:59.204 --> 44:00.704
"Can I have a look?" "Yeah."

44:14.260 --> 44:16.430
Onwards and upwards.

44:16.512 --> 44:18.432
I'm looking forward
to the next gig, actually,

44:18.514 --> 44:19.854
'cause it's a student union.

44:19.933 --> 44:22.023
And it's, um, a guaranteed crowd.

44:22.101 --> 44:23.459
It's their big Saturday night.

44:23.519 --> 44:26.809
So, er,
yeah, let's show them what we can do.

44:29.734 --> 44:32.534
Here they are. The rabble.

44:32.654 --> 44:35.074
I beat 'em here easy. The old Insignia.

44:35.156 --> 44:36.866
Sat nav. So...

44:36.950 --> 44:38.660
What kept you?

44:39.661 --> 44:40.951
This way.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.079
Uh-oh.

44:43.539 --> 44:44.539
My ugly mug.

44:45.917 --> 44:48.707
"David Brent. Shite Night"?

44:48.836 --> 44:50.916
Why have they... That's...

44:51.047 --> 44:52.547
"The crappiest entertainment
of the past 50 years."

44:52.674 --> 44:53.924
Fuck's sake, David.

44:54.050 --> 44:55.630
Well, I didn't do it, did I?

44:58.471 --> 44:59.931
They're pissed off with me.

45:00.056 --> 45:01.556
Like I made the poster.

45:03.101 --> 45:04.981
It wasn't their head
on a piece of dog shit, was it?

45:05.103 --> 45:07.563
It was mine, so...

45:09.649 --> 45:11.069
I can't do anything right.

45:13.403 --> 45:15.573
Oh, for fuck's sake.

45:20.743 --> 45:23.953
# Agadou dou dou dou

45:24.080 --> 45:25.580
# Push pineapple shake the tree

45:25.665 --> 45:27.575
# Agadou dou dou dou

45:27.667 --> 45:29.577
# Push pineapple grind coffee #

45:30.712 --> 45:31.882
Come in.

45:33.589 --> 45:35.969
Oh, embarrassing. You caught me.

45:36.092 --> 45:37.512
Well, I didn't catch you. I knocked.

45:37.593 --> 45:38.763
- You said, "Come in".
- Yeah, sorry.

45:38.886 --> 45:41.306
Totally lost in the art of kata.

45:41.389 --> 45:42.538
Er, Japanese.

45:42.598 --> 45:43.598
- So...
- Right.

45:45.560 --> 45:46.542
- Do you do it?
- What?

45:46.602 --> 45:47.602
- Martial arts?
- No.

45:47.729 --> 45:49.599
- You're on in ten minutes. Right.
- You should.

45:49.731 --> 45:52.321
Wado-Ryu would suit you
'cause you're wiry.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.190
So what you lack in power,

45:54.319 --> 45:56.552
you make up for in range and flexibility.

45:56.612 --> 45:59.162
My problem is I'm literally all power.

45:59.240 --> 46:02.530
So Shotokan. One punch.

46:02.618 --> 46:05.158
So it's like,
"Oi, mate, I don't want any trouble."

46:05.246 --> 46:06.956
"Well, I do." "Oh, sorry."

46:09.042 --> 46:12.632
"Ooh, night-night, sleep tight.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

46:12.754 --> 46:15.924
"Sorry about the teeth.
I know a good dentist, Dr. Gupta.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.967
"Tell him Brent sent you.
He'll know what happened."

46:18.051 --> 46:20.576
- I'm gonna wait outside.
- See you later.

46:20.636 --> 46:22.046
You all students?

46:22.180 --> 46:24.430
- Yeah!
- Yeah, thought so.

46:24.557 --> 46:29.057
You just got up?
You know, in time for countdown.

46:31.773 --> 46:34.443
Um, who wants a T-shirt?

46:34.567 --> 46:36.277
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

46:36.402 --> 46:38.242
We're selling these,
but I'm gonna give one away now.

46:38.363 --> 46:39.363
Look at this.

46:41.199 --> 46:44.659
Say hello to my little friend. Scarface.

46:46.037 --> 46:47.827
Yeah!

46:49.999 --> 46:52.499
Let's get this party started. Now...

46:53.419 --> 46:55.999
Chris Martin's best friend is Jay Z.

46:56.089 --> 46:58.509
Frank Sinatra had Sammy Davis, Jr.

46:58.633 --> 46:59.673
I've got one, too.

46:59.759 --> 47:03.599
Please welcome Dom Johnson. Whoo!

47:03.679 --> 47:05.759
Black. Well, mixed race.

47:05.848 --> 47:09.678
I'm only actually used, when you
check it, on like two or three songs.

47:09.769 --> 47:12.399
And it's his dad that's the white one.

47:12.480 --> 47:16.270
You know, the rest of the time, I'm just
standing around at the side of the stage.

47:16.401 --> 47:19.441
Watching his back
and the audience's faces.

47:19.529 --> 47:21.699
This one's called Equality Street.

47:32.208 --> 47:33.328
Ah!

47:34.710 --> 47:36.460
# Let me take you down Equality Street #

47:36.546 --> 47:38.336
I'm starting to regret
having taken this on.

47:38.464 --> 47:41.224
I'm sorry, lads. It's a complete joke.

47:41.300 --> 47:42.840
I don't think any of us
could have predicted...

47:42.927 --> 47:44.297
Just how mental he is.

47:44.429 --> 47:46.139
It's our reputation, innit.
That's the problem.

47:46.264 --> 47:48.314
What we gonna... Who's gonna take us on?

47:48.433 --> 47:51.443
# Deyo, deyo, deyo, me say deyo

47:51.519 --> 47:55.269
# Biddly, biddly, biddly, biddly,
Biddly, biddly, bong yo #

47:55.356 --> 47:58.674
He just has me rapping
about a lot of weird shit, you know,

47:58.734 --> 48:02.324
that I personally
wouldn't normally rap about.

48:02.447 --> 48:04.067
# Black people aren't crazy

48:04.157 --> 48:05.907
# Fat people aren't lazy

48:06.742 --> 48:08.452
# And dwarves aren't babies

48:08.536 --> 48:09.946
# You can't just pick 'em up

48:10.079 --> 48:11.459
# They got rights

48:11.539 --> 48:13.169
# And anyway don't assume you could

48:13.291 --> 48:14.581
# They're not light #

48:17.753 --> 48:19.053
Hiya. Hiya.

48:45.990 --> 48:48.160
I'm no Lothario, believe me,

48:48.284 --> 48:53.214
but, um, he is the worst person, um,
around women I think I've ever seen.

49:12.391 --> 49:15.941
My mum used to say
there's someone out there for everyone.

49:16.020 --> 49:20.230
And I think for David especially,
it's important to believe that.

49:20.358 --> 49:23.608
Because... you just gotta
hope and pray deep down

49:23.736 --> 49:25.816
that there's somebody out there

49:25.947 --> 49:31.447
who's just totally given up on life
that could make him very happy.

49:31.577 --> 49:32.768
It's just...

49:32.828 --> 49:35.328
Excuse me. Can we have the bill, please?

49:35.414 --> 49:39.170
- Oh, shall I put it on your room?
- Rooms. We're not... Separate rooms.

49:39.252 --> 49:43.762
- So you want separate bills?
- No, no, no. Put it on my room, 106.

49:43.839 --> 49:47.049
But "no" that we're not...
I wouldn't. Not with him.

49:47.176 --> 49:48.756
And not because he's a black man.

49:48.844 --> 49:50.224
Because he's a man.

49:50.346 --> 49:52.256
I'd do it with a black woman, for example.

49:52.390 --> 49:53.390
Not you.

49:53.474 --> 49:55.274
Well, yes, you. Yeah.

49:56.269 --> 49:59.939
If you were consenting
and above legal age,

50:00.022 --> 50:01.482
which you obviously are.

50:01.607 --> 50:02.798
Not obviously.

50:02.858 --> 50:03.858
So...

50:03.985 --> 50:05.645
As soon as he's around women,

50:05.778 --> 50:09.778
it's like he can't relax, you know,
and that's all he needs to do.

50:09.865 --> 50:13.785
Thirty-five.
So let's make that 50, shall we?

50:13.869 --> 50:16.369
£15 tip.

50:16.998 --> 50:20.458
Think what I'd spend on her
if we were having intercourse.

50:20.585 --> 50:22.818
Suddenly something just switches.

50:22.878 --> 50:26.628
It's like a wall of Jenga that just...
It just crumbles.

50:27.216 --> 50:28.796
She's happy.

50:28.884 --> 50:31.804
There's a moment you can just hear
his body collapse.

50:31.887 --> 50:32.887
It's bizarre.

50:36.892 --> 50:38.312
Hello, Lavichem.

50:44.108 --> 50:45.398
Brentmeister.

50:46.319 --> 50:50.529
Hello? Battersea Home
for Retired Penguins. Maurice speaking.

50:50.656 --> 50:52.848
- I'm depressed.
- Oh, what's up?

50:52.908 --> 50:55.078
The gigs are shit,
the band don't talk to me,

50:55.202 --> 50:56.832
can't get anyone along.

50:56.912 --> 50:58.622
This is my last chance, you know.

50:58.706 --> 51:00.206
If I don't get signed now...

51:00.291 --> 51:03.001
I'm running out of money
and I'm running out of time.

51:03.085 --> 51:04.665
- I'm so fed up.
- Come on, mate.

51:04.754 --> 51:06.344
This ain't like you.

51:06.464 --> 51:08.094
You remember what you said to me once?

51:08.215 --> 51:10.835
"It's not how hard you can hit,

51:10.926 --> 51:14.870
"it's how hard you can get hit
and still keep moving forward."

51:14.930 --> 51:16.850
It's from Rocky, mate. It's from Rocky.

51:16.932 --> 51:21.272
Yeah... but when you said it,
it made me think about life.

51:21.354 --> 51:23.524
Whereas he was just talking about boxing.

51:23.648 --> 51:26.882
No, he meant it metaphorically
in the movie, so...

51:26.942 --> 51:30.652
- Yeah. Still, though, innit?
- Don't tell anyone about this phone call.

51:31.739 --> 51:33.069
All right then, I won't.

51:33.157 --> 51:34.907
- See you later.
- See you later.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.950
- Was that David?
- Uh, yeah.

51:39.163 --> 51:42.043
- Is he okay?
- No, a bit low.

51:42.124 --> 51:44.900
You know, rock 'n' roll pressures.

51:44.960 --> 51:47.050
Mmm. Dear.

51:50.966 --> 51:52.876
- Me knackers.
- Hmm?

51:52.968 --> 51:56.388
- Well, oh, just what David says.
- Oh, yeah.

51:58.140 --> 52:00.480
Why you no risten, sirry rady?

52:00.559 --> 52:02.809
- Ho Lee Fuk.
- Yeah.

52:03.979 --> 52:04.979
Yeah.

52:08.984 --> 52:10.994
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

52:13.989 --> 52:16.279
- You okay?
- Yeah.

52:18.119 --> 52:19.789
You missing David?

52:20.996 --> 52:22.366
I am, a bit.

52:22.498 --> 52:24.940
Look, Nigel,
don't start playing with all that crap.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.540
You're not in charge.

52:27.545 --> 52:29.625
I don't think all this is good for him.

52:29.755 --> 52:32.585
- What, the tour?
- No, this.

52:32.717 --> 52:34.217
This documentary.

52:34.343 --> 52:35.593
I think he's only doing it

52:35.720 --> 52:37.800
'cause he thought it would be
better than the first time.

52:37.930 --> 52:39.560
But it's not better, it's worse.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.956
Why is it worse?

52:41.016 --> 52:44.136
You know, he was the boss at Wernham Hogg.

52:44.228 --> 52:47.108
And he worked with basically nice people.

52:47.189 --> 52:50.319
And here he's not the boss, you know,

52:50.401 --> 52:53.031
and it's mainly worse
because the world's worse.

52:53.154 --> 52:54.744
It's dog eat dog.

52:54.822 --> 52:57.740
Keep the fucking noise down.
Keep the fucking noise down, you silly cunt.

52:57.825 --> 52:59.655
Sit fucking down, silly bollocks.

53:00.661 --> 53:02.001
Fuck me.

53:04.039 --> 53:07.629
Stop fucking playing up
to the cameras, yeah?

53:09.837 --> 53:11.457
Jane, hello.

53:11.589 --> 53:13.169
- Yes.
- Jezza?

53:13.257 --> 53:15.587
- We will... Hang on a second, please?
- Why do you... Jezza!

53:15.676 --> 53:17.546
- Hello.
- Why do you talk to people like that?

53:19.054 --> 53:20.996
Why are you such a bully?

53:21.056 --> 53:22.886
- I'm trying to fucking work, babe.
- Don't care.

53:23.017 --> 53:24.057
So is everyone else.

53:24.185 --> 53:26.595
He's only having a laugh. Look at him.

53:51.253 --> 53:53.303
Another day, another dollar.

53:56.634 --> 53:57.684
Checking in.

53:59.094 --> 54:02.104
Want an early morning alarm call? No.

54:03.599 --> 54:06.309
- David, we're gonna need your card.
- Yeah.

54:10.105 --> 54:13.265
So now he's saying
we gotta save money, so...

54:14.527 --> 54:17.027
we gotta be in a twin room. Sharing.

54:17.905 --> 54:20.105
You know, it's... it's awkward, man.

54:21.116 --> 54:22.616
It's just not gangsta.

54:27.122 --> 54:28.252
Hey.

54:34.672 --> 54:38.073
Just writing a song about the, uh, plight
of the Native American, so...

54:38.133 --> 54:40.133
Which is a cause
very close to my heart, innit?

54:40.219 --> 54:42.719
- Is it?
- Yeah, I'm always going on about it.

54:43.430 --> 54:45.520
So listen.

54:45.641 --> 54:49.141
# Oh, oh, your red heart rages

54:52.106 --> 54:55.356
# Cut down, burned out
And put in cages

54:58.153 --> 55:00.783
# You came in peace
Held up your hand

55:00.906 --> 55:02.526
# How

55:04.159 --> 55:07.949
# We cut it off
And we stole your land

55:10.875 --> 55:14.585
# Oh, oh, Native American

55:16.922 --> 55:20.722
# Soar like an eagle
Sit like a pelican

55:23.762 --> 55:27.682
# Oh, oh, don't call us Indians

55:29.184 --> 55:33.194
# We're more like West Eurasians
crossed with Siberians #

55:33.314 --> 55:34.404
Have you been on Wikipedia?

55:34.523 --> 55:37.113
- Have I been on what?
- Wikipedia.

55:37.192 --> 55:41.112
Yeah. "Migrated from West Eurasia
and Siberia, 15..."

55:41.196 --> 55:42.816
So knowledge is knowledge.

55:42.948 --> 55:46.141
I prefer my songs
to be factually accurate.

55:46.201 --> 55:47.991
Where's the bit about them
sitting like pelicans?

55:48.120 --> 55:49.290
That's not in there, is it?

55:49.371 --> 55:52.147
- Is it a fact though?
- It's an artist's opinion.

55:52.207 --> 55:54.417
- What artist?
- Me.

55:54.543 --> 55:55.593
Right.

55:55.711 --> 55:58.153
- Because it sounds like a dis, though.
- It's not a dis.

55:58.213 --> 56:00.423
Native Americans
love to be called animals.

56:00.549 --> 56:03.129
Things like Soaring Eagle,
Running Bear, Lone Wolf.

56:03.218 --> 56:07.308
Yeah, but that's different.
That's bears, wolves, eagles.

56:07.389 --> 56:09.219
- They're like cool animals, bruv.
- All right.

56:09.308 --> 56:11.138
- Pelican's like a joke bird.
- No.

56:11.226 --> 56:14.016
It's like a little squat thing
with that fat little throat and that.

56:14.146 --> 56:16.976
Oh... animal racist.

56:34.249 --> 56:38.959
This next song is about
the greatest place in the world, Slough.

56:39.046 --> 56:42.197
Everything in this song
is factually accurate.

56:42.257 --> 56:44.677
So you might learn something as well.

56:44.802 --> 56:48.203
# More convenient than a Tesco Express

56:48.263 --> 56:51.273
# Close to Windsor
But the property's less

56:51.350 --> 56:55.060
# It keeps the businesses
Of Britain great

56:55.187 --> 56:57.857
# It's got Europe's
Biggest trading estate

56:59.274 --> 57:01.484
# It doesn't matter where you're from

57:01.610 --> 57:05.070
# You wanna work
Then come along

57:05.698 --> 57:08.223
# The station's just got a new floor

57:08.283 --> 57:12.293
# And the motorway runs by your door

57:13.288 --> 57:16.918
# And you know just where you're headin'

57:18.836 --> 57:23.836
# It's equidistant
'Tween London and Reading

57:24.842 --> 57:27.242
# Oh, oh, oh, Slough

57:27.302 --> 57:29.244
# Slough

57:29.304 --> 57:31.246
# My kind of town

57:31.306 --> 57:34.306
# I don't know how

57:36.020 --> 57:38.060
# Anyone could put you down

57:38.147 --> 57:42.817
# Oh, oh, oh, Slough #

57:49.491 --> 57:51.411
Ooh, yeah! Slough.

57:51.493 --> 57:55.543
Right, who wants a T-shirt? Yeah! Whoo!

57:55.664 --> 57:57.334
Here we go.

58:04.131 --> 58:06.421
You play a show, and just when
you think it can't get any worse,

58:06.508 --> 58:09.338
you shoot a fat girl in the face
with a T-shirt gun.

58:09.470 --> 58:11.470
That was just ridiculous, really,
wasn't it?

58:11.555 --> 58:13.345
I didn't really know
whether to laugh or cry.

58:13.474 --> 58:15.290
There's been quite a few moments
like that, I think.

58:15.350 --> 58:16.350
There have, yeah.

58:16.435 --> 58:18.293
Accidents will happen.

58:18.353 --> 58:20.863
So... someone got shot in the face

58:20.939 --> 58:24.689
by a T-shirt gun. You know,
let's not make a drama out of it.

58:25.444 --> 58:29.364
I let her keep the T-shirt, so...
It won't fit her.

58:29.490 --> 58:31.370
She won't get anywhere near it.

58:40.709 --> 58:43.499
- Briony?
- What?

58:43.587 --> 58:46.297
- What are you doing?
- Getting off with a bloke.

58:46.381 --> 58:48.721
- What did you think of the gig?
- I didn't see it. I was getting off...

58:48.801 --> 58:50.971
You were getting off with a bloke.
Yeah, sure.

58:52.387 --> 58:54.307
Good, innit?

58:54.389 --> 58:58.229
Paying them... to get off with people.

58:58.352 --> 59:00.142
It's a new job description, innit?

59:01.688 --> 59:02.808
All aboard.

59:07.027 --> 59:10.397
What if I did that? What if I just got off
with people all the time?

59:10.531 --> 59:11.911
Willy-nilly.

59:14.910 --> 59:15.990
Cheers.

59:20.040 --> 59:23.330
...stay at his house
because you won't sort yourself out.

59:23.418 --> 59:25.360
- Hiya.
- All right?

59:25.420 --> 59:27.510
Just getting some cash out
to go to a club?

59:27.589 --> 59:28.839
Yeah.

59:28.966 --> 59:30.966
For a drink? No need.

59:31.051 --> 59:33.261
I've just played here. I'm in a band.

59:33.387 --> 59:35.007
They're doing a documentary about me.

59:35.139 --> 59:38.373
So I'm staying in a... In a hotel.

59:38.433 --> 59:41.523
So if you wanna come back for a drink,

59:41.603 --> 59:44.063
I got a minibar and it's...

59:47.609 --> 59:48.939
Can we stay?

59:52.447 --> 59:53.447
Yep.

59:55.450 --> 59:56.530
So...

59:56.618 --> 59:58.448
We got beer, wine.

59:58.579 --> 01:00:00.959
- Was that champagne?
- Yeah, but it's 25 quid

01:00:01.039 --> 01:00:03.039
and they're just half bottles,
so it's not worth it.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:05.400
- There's two half bottles though.
- Yeah, exactly. So 50 then.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.170
Oh, there's Toblerone.

01:00:07.254 --> 01:00:09.404
- Yeah, they're a fiver each. Two, tenner.
- Give me one.

01:00:09.464 --> 01:00:11.674
Sixty so far. That's good, innit?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.840
- It's great.
- Yeah.

01:00:13.969 --> 01:00:15.849
Straight in the Toblerone, eh?

01:00:15.971 --> 01:00:18.561
- Have you not eaten?
- Not since dinner.

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:23.482
- Here we go.
- Yeah. Come on, party.

01:00:26.106 --> 01:00:27.976
Get that down you.

01:00:28.066 --> 01:00:29.424
- Chocolate, champagne.
- Cheers.

01:00:29.484 --> 01:00:31.324
Cheers. Right.

01:00:31.445 --> 01:00:32.485
Cheers.

01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:34.318
I like it here.

01:00:34.448 --> 01:00:36.238
- Take your jackets off.
- Yeah, I will, actually.

01:00:36.325 --> 01:00:38.485
- I haven't got any clean pants.
- Huh?

01:00:39.494 --> 01:00:40.914
She hasn't got any clean pants.

01:00:42.497 --> 01:00:43.997
Oh, it's hot.

01:00:44.082 --> 01:00:45.252
It is hot.

01:00:45.334 --> 01:00:46.504
Put them on the radiator.

01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:50.445
So, what do you two do?

01:00:50.505 --> 01:00:51.625
Work in an office.

01:00:52.765 --> 01:00:54.315
Do you?

01:00:54.927 --> 01:00:56.717
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:56.845 --> 01:00:57.885
Office.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:20.238
I still think there's
some mouthwash if you...

01:01:20.327 --> 01:01:21.476
- No, I'm all right.
- What is it?

01:01:21.536 --> 01:01:23.656
Just chocolate and crisps and nuts...

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:25.480
- Yeah, peanuts.
- ...and it's stuck in your teeth, is it?

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.250
- No.
- Nightmare, aren't they?

01:01:27.334 --> 01:01:29.174
Yeah, pain, ain't they?

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:32.264
Gets worse when you get older
and then you get that sort of smell.

01:01:32.339 --> 01:01:33.339
Yeah.

01:01:40.555 --> 01:01:42.385
- Nothing happened.
- Huh?

01:01:42.516 --> 01:01:46.266
Just saying... Nothing happened.
She slept in that bed. Didn't you?

01:01:46.353 --> 01:01:48.153
- Ate her way through the minibar.
- What?

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.505
You had a little picnic last night,
didn't you?

01:01:50.565 --> 01:01:52.065
- With the chocolate and crisps?
- Yeah.

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:53.320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:53.402 --> 01:01:55.782
Yeah. Bit constipated today, though.

01:01:55.904 --> 01:01:58.114
Yes, you would be.

01:01:58.198 --> 01:02:02.517
So, there you go.
Good one, the other one, left. Left to...

01:02:02.577 --> 01:02:07.497
Apparently, just wanted to stay somewhere
'cause her flat's being done, isn't it?

01:02:07.582 --> 01:02:09.922
Yeah. Yeah, it's a bit of a bomb site
at the moment.

01:02:10.002 --> 01:02:12.802
The council are putting a new bathroom in.
But it was nice to have a lie-in...

01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:14.529
- Yeah.
- ...and have a lovely bath.

01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:15.799
So perfect.

01:02:15.924 --> 01:02:17.724
Oh...

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.535
Hiya. Right, okay.

01:02:20.595 --> 01:02:22.715
So, nothing happened. Okay?

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:25.596
- Is that a woman?
- 'Course it's a woman.

01:02:26.601 --> 01:02:29.151
She stayed in that bed, and she
made her way through that little lot.

01:02:29.229 --> 01:02:30.349
- She ate all of that?
- Yes.

01:02:30.439 --> 01:02:32.609
- She's gonna be constipated.
- She is.

01:02:33.525 --> 01:02:35.685
If you tell the band
I got off with a bird...

01:02:35.777 --> 01:02:37.817
- But you didn't.
- No. No.

01:02:37.946 --> 01:02:39.554
But if you want to do
some banter with them, like,

01:02:39.614 --> 01:02:42.124
"Oh, David got off with a girl
last night." And don't...

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.700
- No. I just won't say anything.
- You can, but listen.

01:02:44.786 --> 01:02:47.456
Just don't describe her. Okay?
Don't be specific...

01:02:47.581 --> 01:02:49.171
- I'm off here, David.
- See you later. Yeah.

01:02:49.249 --> 01:02:51.539
- Okay. Thanks for the snack and that.
- Not a problem.

01:02:51.626 --> 01:02:54.546
I'll... Snack, yeah. I'll clean that up.

01:02:54.629 --> 01:02:55.570
All right.

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:57.572
- Okay. Ta-ta, then.
- Bye.

01:03:00.635 --> 01:03:03.635
So, what... So, yeah. Yeah.

01:03:04.598 --> 01:03:08.638
My good deed for the... £200 good deed.

01:03:08.769 --> 01:03:11.559
Pop that in your little expense account,
shall we?

01:03:19.071 --> 01:03:21.596
A daily ritual is phoning around
all the record companies,

01:03:21.656 --> 01:03:24.366
just trying to get one of them
to come down and see you live.

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:27.405
Half the time, they're not there.

01:03:27.496 --> 01:03:29.156
Half the time we don't get through.

01:03:29.247 --> 01:03:31.077
I managed to get one of them to bite

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.608
by pretending to be
the manager of my own band.

01:03:33.668 --> 01:03:35.378
Which I am, in a way.

01:03:35.462 --> 01:03:37.672
- What are they called?
- Foregone Conclusion.

01:03:37.756 --> 01:03:40.166
- Awful name. Yeah.
- I told them that.

01:03:40.258 --> 01:03:42.298
I'm gonna make them change it.
Don't worry about that.

01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:43.618
- But don't hold that against them.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:03:43.678 --> 01:03:46.178
- They're a good bunch of guys.
- Sure.

01:03:46.264 --> 01:03:47.622
- So, yeah.
- Sure. Yeah, okay.

01:03:47.682 --> 01:03:50.852
Well, I'll get one of the scouts to listen
to the demo, and he can pop down.

01:03:50.977 --> 01:03:52.517
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:03:52.646 --> 01:03:54.686
- Right, see you. Yep. Bye.
- Cheers.

01:03:57.692 --> 01:04:00.652
Right. Off to the sound check.
I can't wait to tell Dom.

01:04:01.655 --> 01:04:04.445
This is what it's all about, so...

01:04:06.785 --> 01:04:08.865
The venue, isn't it?

01:04:08.995 --> 01:04:11.115
Oh, God. Hi, boys.

01:04:12.707 --> 01:04:13.707
Ah...

01:04:14.709 --> 01:04:18.209
Has he been telling everyone I got off
with a bird last night?

01:04:18.296 --> 01:04:21.086
Oh, what, the big one?
Yeah, we saw her. She was at breakfast.

01:04:21.216 --> 01:04:22.256
She was loading up on eggs.

01:04:22.342 --> 01:04:23.842
Oh, man, that's gonna make her
even more constipated.

01:04:25.053 --> 01:04:26.643
- Yeah, eggs.
- Dan?

01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:27.721
I'm coming.

01:04:29.057 --> 01:04:30.427
Er...

01:04:31.143 --> 01:04:33.273
Don't tell the boys,
I don't wanna stress them,

01:04:33.353 --> 01:04:36.943
but I've been winding up a record company
and they're sending someone down.

01:04:37.065 --> 01:04:38.065
- Tonight?
- Yeah. I said,

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:40.030
"Cruise down. I'll stick you on the list."

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.950
So, uh, you might wanna let them know
they are with a winner.

01:04:44.448 --> 01:04:46.158
I thought you said
I shouldn't tell the band?

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:48.373
No, I know. I don't wanna,
you know, worry 'em

01:04:48.493 --> 01:04:50.293
'cause they're probably
not used to the big league,

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:54.460
but, you know, let them know
there is a big buzz around Mr D. Brent,

01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:57.591
ipso facto, anyone on his team.

01:04:57.711 --> 01:04:59.501
- Don't you wanna tell them?
- No.

01:04:59.588 --> 01:05:00.748
They don't talk to me.

01:05:02.382 --> 01:05:04.699
They don't even have a drink with me,
do they?

01:05:04.759 --> 01:05:07.139
Why don't they have a drink with me
after the gig?

01:05:07.262 --> 01:05:10.392
You know, I am paying them.
Tell them to have a drink with me.

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:13.765
It's just rude. Just go and ask them.
Let's have a drink tonight.

01:05:14.769 --> 01:05:16.519
Oh...

01:05:17.856 --> 01:05:20.356
He's excited. Gonna tell the band.

01:05:23.695 --> 01:05:27.985
They said, um, that you pay
for their stage time and rehearsal time,

01:05:28.116 --> 01:05:31.726
but their time is their own
and, um, you're not paying for that. So...

01:05:31.786 --> 01:05:34.616
Okay. Would they have a drink with me
if I paid them for their time

01:05:34.748 --> 01:05:35.958
to have a drink with me? Go and ask.

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:39.590
This is what David is.

01:05:39.711 --> 01:05:42.091
He's like the boy that owns the football

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:44.592
but he doesn't really know
the rules of the game.

01:05:44.716 --> 01:05:49.744
It's his ball, right? So you have to...
You can't play without him.

01:05:49.804 --> 01:05:53.748
You know what I'm saying? But you kinda
know he's gonna ruin it a little bit.

01:05:53.808 --> 01:05:58.558
They said, uh, they'll drink with you
for 25 quid an hour each.

01:05:58.647 --> 01:06:00.807
Um, but you buy the drinks.

01:06:00.899 --> 01:06:05.760
Okay. Tell them to meet me
in the hotel bar after the gig.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.240
All right. Do I have to come?

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:09.445
You wanna come.

01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:11.744
- But I'm not getting paid?
- No. No.

01:06:11.826 --> 01:06:14.446
And tell them not to tell anyone
I'm paying them to have a drink.

01:06:14.579 --> 01:06:16.771
Just... have a...

01:06:20.335 --> 01:06:21.335
Oh...

01:06:22.837 --> 01:06:27.047
Trying to organise
some beers after to celebrate, so...

01:06:43.858 --> 01:06:45.858
Hi. Should be on the list
for Foregone Conclusion.

01:06:45.944 --> 01:06:47.994
- Toke Records.
- Hello.

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:49.951
- David Brent.
- Oh, hi.

01:06:50.031 --> 01:06:51.621
Thanks for coming down. What's your name?

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.780
- Pog.
- Pog?

01:06:52.867 --> 01:06:54.237
- Yeah, and this is my mate, Jeremy.
- Hi.

01:06:54.369 --> 01:06:56.159
These dudes are on my list. Tick 'em off.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.406
So, uh, did you hear the demo, yeah?

01:06:58.498 --> 01:07:00.458
No. How old are the band?

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:01.816
What, combined?

01:07:01.876 --> 01:07:03.376
- What?
- They're about...

01:07:03.461 --> 01:07:07.801
There's four of 'em, 25 years old each.
I don't know, 100?

01:07:07.882 --> 01:07:08.882
Plus the lead singer.

01:07:09.009 --> 01:07:10.719
- You do the maths.
- Is the lead singer cool?

01:07:12.178 --> 01:07:15.098
You do the... judge of that
when you see him.

01:07:15.223 --> 01:07:18.273
And ask yourself,
"Is Mick Jagger cool, 73?

01:07:18.393 --> 01:07:20.733
"Is Bob Dylan cool, 75?

01:07:20.854 --> 01:07:22.404
- "Is Sting cool?"
- No.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.440
- What?
- Sting isn't cool.

01:07:24.524 --> 01:07:26.194
Oh...

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:28.816
Check it out. Listen.

01:07:28.903 --> 01:07:30.903
Open your mind and listen.
You'll enjoy it.

01:07:30.989 --> 01:07:32.279
Have a good one.

01:07:33.658 --> 01:07:34.849
Cheers, man.

01:07:35.709 --> 01:07:38.709
Fucking hell. How old is he? About 12?

01:07:39.539 --> 01:07:41.289
Chill out, dude. This is rock 'n' roll.

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:43.916
And Sting is cool.

01:07:46.004 --> 01:07:47.004
Ooh!

01:07:47.922 --> 01:07:48.922
Yeah.

01:07:49.049 --> 01:07:52.219
We are Foregone Conclusion.

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:56.012
Okay, we got a little treat now.
We are gonna get a little bit funky.

01:07:56.097 --> 01:08:00.227
Um, I say a little bit,
but probably too funky for some.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:05.650
This one is called Ain't No Trouble.
It's through the eyes of an old Rasta.

01:08:05.732 --> 01:08:07.022
- Don't do the voice.
- You gotta do the voice.

01:08:07.108 --> 01:08:08.228
- No, you don't.
- You do.

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:11.398
So it's sort of like he's saying,
"Oh, whatever happens to me,

01:08:11.529 --> 01:08:15.989
"as long as I've got me woman, you know,
you can do what you like, Lord."

01:08:16.117 --> 01:08:19.077
So, it's sort of like a message.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.162
Called Ain't No Trouble.

01:08:21.288 --> 01:08:23.078
I mean, you think it's painful to watch.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:28.336
Yeah, I have to stand on the stage
next to him while he's doing it.

01:08:28.421 --> 01:08:32.381
It's what the dreads in UB40
have been going through for 30 years.

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:46.015
# I can work all day
Just to earn a dollar

01:08:46.147 --> 01:08:50.925
# I can break my bones
You never hear me holler

01:08:50.984 --> 01:08:55.774
# I can lose my home
I'm kicked out in the street

01:08:55.865 --> 01:09:00.615
# If my baby's by my side
Then life is sweet #

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:03.575
Maybe 'cause I'm there,
he wants to play up to it

01:09:03.665 --> 01:09:05.995
or he wants to be accepted.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.170
But I think people would accept him
if he just was himself.

01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:12.795
# I could lose my job

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:13.881
# But it would be fine

01:09:14.008 --> 01:09:15.678
# 'Cause I could still find
The odd snob to rob

01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:17.471
# I could get chucked out

01:09:17.595 --> 01:09:19.045
# Of my mum's house
But it could be fun

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.760
# Sleeping rough
When the sun's out

01:09:20.849 --> 01:09:22.019
# I could lose my voice

01:09:22.142 --> 01:09:23.602
# But I'd manage to still do

01:09:23.685 --> 01:09:25.595
# Some sick rhyme damage
With sign language

01:09:25.687 --> 01:09:26.961
# You can take what's mine

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.441
# Almost anything
X-Box, wedding ring, fish tank, terrapin

01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:35.397
# Poke me in the eyeball, pull out a gun
Say something spiteful about my mum

01:09:35.488 --> 01:09:37.488
# Tease my dog
So he doesn't even know it

01:09:37.615 --> 01:09:40.075
# By going to throw a bone
But just pretending to throw it

01:09:40.201 --> 01:09:42.911
# Make death threats, yeah
Then I have to guess where

01:09:43.037 --> 01:09:45.247
# Then when I get there
Pull out my chest hair

01:09:45.372 --> 01:09:47.252
# Head-butt me in the nuts if you want

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:49.665
# 'Cause ain't no trouble
Like losing the one you love

01:09:49.794 --> 01:09:52.174
- # Ain't no trouble like trouble
- # Yeah, yeah

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:54.505
- # When you lose the one you love
- # Come on, come on

01:09:54.632 --> 01:09:56.991
- # Ain't no trouble like trouble
- # Yeah, yeah

01:09:57.051 --> 01:09:59.891
- # When you lose the one you love
- # Come on, come on #

01:10:00.013 --> 01:10:00.995
What did you think?

01:10:01.055 --> 01:10:06.095
Dreadful. Embarrassing.
I mean, the rap was all right, but...

01:10:06.227 --> 01:10:09.307
not with some middle-aged uncle
at a wedding dancing around.

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:13.479
# Then I see this face
And she smiles at me

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:14.990
# If I died right then... #

01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:18.069
He's excruciating, uh, on stage and off.

01:10:19.073 --> 01:10:22.413
And now we gotta go and have a drink
with him, you know. I mean, it's awkward.

01:10:23.494 --> 01:10:24.454
Oh, right. Okay.

01:10:24.537 --> 01:10:27.021
Hey.

01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:28.251
After show.

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.024
- Cheers, David.
- Thanks, man.

01:10:30.084 --> 01:10:31.924
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thank you.

01:10:32.045 --> 01:10:34.028
- Cheers.
- Cheers, mate.

01:10:34.088 --> 01:10:35.088
Nice.

01:10:36.049 --> 01:10:37.049
God.

01:10:40.553 --> 01:10:43.473
Twitter. Or texting.

01:10:44.098 --> 01:10:45.888
It's all social media, isn't it?

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:48.095
The iPhone, the iPod...

01:10:48.895 --> 01:10:51.145
Ten thousand songs
in the palm of your hand, yeah?

01:10:51.272 --> 01:10:52.312
Yes, please.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.051
No more lugging round me albums.
Let's play a record. Let's get it out.

01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:58.991
God, let's get it out the sleeve.

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:01.526
- I like vinyl.
- I like vinyl.

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:04.278
Yeah, I love the whole thing
of the paraphernalia.

01:11:04.369 --> 01:11:08.789
Oh, Arctic Monkeys. Yeah. Stylus.

01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:11.751
Oh, I love this one.

01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:13.067
- You do like it?
- Yeah.

01:11:13.127 --> 01:11:14.287
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:11:14.379 --> 01:11:17.709
Especially if it is something
like the Arctic Monkeys or...

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:20.335
Foo Fighters.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.082
About time England won a World Cup, innit?

01:11:28.142 --> 01:11:32.402
- Yeah.
- 1966. Sort it out.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:34.732
There's some fresh blood
coming through the ranks now, though.

01:11:34.816 --> 01:11:37.276
Got some good players.
They need to be managed, though.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.400
Sturridge.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.530
Yeah, come and play for us, boy.

01:11:42.615 --> 01:11:44.315
Not all this thing,
"You can't have foreign players".

01:11:44.409 --> 01:11:47.409
- Well, he was born in England.
- No, I know. But it's like...

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.707
You can't have foreign players
in an international team.

01:11:49.789 --> 01:11:50.999
- No.
- It's just for clubs.

01:11:51.124 --> 01:11:55.504
I know. I'm saying get him in,
get him up front. Let's get some goals.

01:12:01.175 --> 01:12:03.385
- Dom? Bob Marley.
- Hmm?

01:12:04.304 --> 01:12:05.354
Am I right?

01:12:07.015 --> 01:12:08.055
Yeah.

01:12:14.772 --> 01:12:16.062
Mmm.

01:12:17.358 --> 01:12:19.228
- Same again?
- No, I can't.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.360
- No? See you later.
- Cheers.

01:12:21.446 --> 01:12:23.137
- Thanks for the drinks, David.
- Yeah, not a problem, mate.

01:12:23.197 --> 01:12:25.617
See you tomorrow. Lightweights.

01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:27.141
- Where are you going?
- I just...

01:12:27.201 --> 01:12:29.871
- No, we're gonna have another one.
- Really?

01:12:29.996 --> 01:12:31.196
We're gonna have a laugh.

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:33.955
- Come on.
- Yeah.

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:38.085
You're the only one who cares,
if I'm being honest.

01:12:38.212 --> 01:12:39.552
- Cheers, man.
- Yeah.

01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:41.091
- You're my nigga.
- Whoa!

01:12:41.215 --> 01:12:43.157
- Hey, David, you can't say that.
- You are.

01:12:43.217 --> 01:12:45.587
- You are my real nigga.
- Stop... You don't say that.

01:12:45.678 --> 01:12:47.161
- What?
- Listen. You can't say that.

01:12:47.221 --> 01:12:49.431
I can say it, maybe. You can't say it.

01:12:49.557 --> 01:12:51.217
- Well you call me it, then.
- I'm not gonna...

01:12:51.351 --> 01:12:53.771
- Call me a nigga. Please.
- I'm not gonna call you...

01:12:53.853 --> 01:12:56.170
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Call me a nigga.

01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:58.070
- Just, shh, okay...
- Call me a nigga.

01:12:58.191 --> 01:12:59.231
Stop saying that.

01:13:01.569 --> 01:13:03.199
- You're... you're my nigga. Okay?
- Yeah.

01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:04.279
- All right.
- Cheers.

01:13:04.405 --> 01:13:08.235
Great, go to bed. Jesus.

01:13:10.244 --> 01:13:12.124
- That's your credit card.
- What?

01:13:12.246 --> 01:13:13.996
- That's your credit card.
- It's not working.

01:13:14.082 --> 01:13:15.252
It's a credit... It's not...

01:13:32.392 --> 01:13:33.432
Cool, dudes.

01:13:34.686 --> 01:13:37.396
Battle of the Bands, innit?

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.610
A great night.
They do it every month, you know.

01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:43.441
Each band gets along as many of their fans
as they can to watch them.

01:13:43.528 --> 01:13:45.698
The promoter gets down
some record companies.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.112
And we battle it out.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.030
It's not a competition.
You know, we could all get signed.

01:13:50.118 --> 01:13:54.228
Um, but you do go on in order
of how many people you got along.

01:13:54.288 --> 01:13:56.958
So the more you get along,
the later you go on,

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:59.673
and a better warmed up crowd you play to.

01:13:59.752 --> 01:14:01.042
- Right, you're on first, guys.
- Great.

01:14:01.129 --> 01:14:02.236
How many people did we get?

01:14:02.296 --> 01:14:03.626
- Doesn't matter.
- Two.

01:14:03.715 --> 01:14:05.505
Glad I said it didn't matter
before I found out.

01:14:05.633 --> 01:14:07.241
So, proves I'm telling the truth.

01:14:07.301 --> 01:14:08.891
- That's so depressing.
- He's joking, ain't you?

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:10.890
No point in playing to the converted
all the time.

01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:13.272
Let's get on there
and win over the other bands' fans.

01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:16.250
- Come on, chop-chop.
- Yeah. Ah, whoo!

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:17.310
Come on.

01:14:18.312 --> 01:14:20.232
Hello. Oh...

01:14:20.314 --> 01:14:23.944
We are Foregone Conclusion.
Come through. We're all in this together.

01:14:24.068 --> 01:14:25.938
Doesn't matter what band
you've come to see.

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.261
Let's see all the bands, yeah?

01:14:27.321 --> 01:14:30.121
We're gonna kick off with a song
called Native American.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.489
Um...

01:14:31.576 --> 01:14:34.366
Typical Brent,
getting political straight away.

01:14:34.495 --> 01:14:37.245
No, it's all about how the white man went

01:14:37.331 --> 01:14:40.711
and, sort of, slaughtered them
and enslaved them.

01:14:40.793 --> 01:14:43.383
And it's about time
someone said something, so...

01:14:43.504 --> 01:14:44.554
Guilty.

01:14:45.465 --> 01:14:47.545
Although they are having the last laugh.

01:14:47.675 --> 01:14:51.715
So they can do what they like now
in them reservations, can't they?

01:14:51.804 --> 01:14:55.474
Gambling, prostitution, probably.
I don't know.

01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:58.688
But definitely gambling.
Swings and roundabouts.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:00.350
I don't think they pay tax, do they?

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.560
- Stop talking. Let's just do the song.
- Yeah.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:08.302
And, uh, you'll also learn why they don't
like being called Red Indians any more.

01:15:08.362 --> 01:15:10.492
So, Native American.

01:15:16.496 --> 01:15:18.366
I don't think there's
any real racism on David's part.

01:15:18.498 --> 01:15:21.315
I just think he just doesn't quite get it,
does he?

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:22.625
Yeah, totally.

01:15:23.377 --> 01:15:26.417
# White man's eyes too blind to see

01:15:29.342 --> 01:15:32.972
# A gentle race so wild and free

01:15:35.223 --> 01:15:38.393
# They called you savages
Called you bad

01:15:40.394 --> 01:15:44.404
# But the scalping thing
Was only when you got real mad

01:15:44.524 --> 01:15:45.524
# So

01:15:47.401 --> 01:15:50.651
# Oh, oh
Native American

01:15:52.865 --> 01:15:56.405
# Soar like an eagle
Sit like a pelican

01:15:59.413 --> 01:16:02.873
# Oh, oh, don't call us Indians

01:16:04.418 --> 01:16:08.758
# We're more like West Eurasians
Crossed with Siberians

01:16:18.182 --> 01:16:19.373
Everyone.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.440
# Oh, oh
Native American

01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:35.566
# Soar like an eagle
Sit like a pelican #

01:16:40.246 --> 01:16:43.456
Wasn't great, but would have been better.
There was a little surprise.

01:16:43.583 --> 01:16:45.583
Dom was meant to come on
during Native American and didn't.

01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:46.878
Why didn't you come on?

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.423
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

01:16:49.297 --> 01:16:51.127
Something came over me.

01:16:51.257 --> 01:16:53.467
- Ooh, stage fright?
- No, dignity.

01:16:53.593 --> 01:16:56.013
Don't think you can get more dignified
than a great warrior, so...

01:16:56.095 --> 01:16:57.675
I'm not even a Native American.

01:16:57.805 --> 01:17:00.414
No, you're the closest thing we've got,
and that's a fact. So...

01:17:00.474 --> 01:17:02.416
Okay, Madonna Kebab have pulled out.

01:17:02.476 --> 01:17:04.846
- Anyone wanna go on early?
- We're not going on early.

01:17:05.479 --> 01:17:07.109
We can go on again.
We've got loads of songs.

01:17:07.231 --> 01:17:08.401
- No, you're all right.
- No, I can do it.

01:17:08.482 --> 01:17:10.362
- I could do one of my tracks.
- In that?

01:17:10.484 --> 01:17:13.244
Yeah, I got a backing track. Not in this.
I'll take this off. Two minutes.

01:17:13.321 --> 01:17:14.491
You got your stuff now?
Come on, then. Hurry up.

01:17:14.614 --> 01:17:15.614
- No.
- Come on, then.

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:18.738
You don't wanna do that.
Backing track at a Battle of the Bands.

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:20.328
Didn't know it was karaoke.

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.961
# Yo, I'm tired of this minimum wage

01:17:25.082 --> 01:17:28.042
# Tired of this cage
Tired of not being on the stage

01:17:28.127 --> 01:17:30.497
# Tired of no one reading
What I'm writing on the page

01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:32.920
# Tired of hanging out
With guys twice my age

01:17:33.049 --> 01:17:35.449
# But what's the use of dreams
To a human being

01:17:35.509 --> 01:17:37.469
# If they always prove unseen

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:39.143
# If I am who I think I am

01:17:39.263 --> 01:17:41.433
# Then I gotta transform
Be a better man

01:17:41.515 --> 01:17:43.675
# And if you are who you think you are

01:17:43.768 --> 01:17:46.348
# You should be above the clouds
You should be a star

01:17:46.479 --> 01:17:48.899
# From what I see I'm sure it's hard

01:17:48.981 --> 01:17:52.691
# Can we be more
Than the cards we're dealt?

01:17:52.777 --> 01:17:54.107
Yeah!

01:17:54.195 --> 01:17:55.525
# Yeah

01:17:56.364 --> 01:17:58.472
# Maybe this is just the start

01:17:58.532 --> 01:18:02.542
# Why can't we change
The cards we're dealt?

01:18:03.871 --> 01:18:06.331
# Well, it's more real
Than anything I ever felt

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.415
# But I'm feeling like an irrelevance

01:18:08.542 --> 01:18:11.462
# I wanna soar with eagles
Not waddle with pelicans

01:18:11.545 --> 01:18:13.455
# Okay true
They're birds of prey, too

01:18:13.547 --> 01:18:16.167
# But not the cool ones
You want associated with you

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.220
# Still I wouldn't mind the wingspan

01:18:18.344 --> 01:18:20.604
# I could fly away
From always being everybody's wingman

01:18:20.721 --> 01:18:22.681
# I'm proper different
You gotta listen

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:25.555
# I want a living where I got a bit more
Than a pot to piss in

01:18:25.685 --> 01:18:27.725
# I'm about to prove
I can kick it off soon

01:18:27.812 --> 01:18:30.692
# My time is overdue like a synagogue roof
Come on

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:33.693
# Na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na

01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:35.486
Everybody, come on.

01:18:35.569 --> 01:18:37.779
# Na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na

01:18:37.905 --> 01:18:40.405
Come on and put your hands in the air.

01:18:40.533 --> 01:18:42.703
# Na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na

01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:45.519
Keep them hands in the air.
Keep them coming, come on.

01:18:45.579 --> 01:18:47.521
# Na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na

01:18:47.581 --> 01:18:49.581
# It's more real
Than anything I ever felt #

01:18:57.341 --> 01:18:58.341
Thank you.

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:01.970
Thank you.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.547
- What did you think?
- Ah, I wasn't really watching, mate.

01:19:13.607 --> 01:19:15.549
I was just, um...

01:19:15.609 --> 01:19:17.279
Er, you know...

01:19:17.403 --> 01:19:19.533
I like the lyric
about the eagles and pelicans.

01:19:19.613 --> 01:19:20.953
- Yeah, it's like a reference...
- Yeah, I know, yeah.

01:19:21.032 --> 01:19:22.992
Yeah, a week ago,
you didn't like songs with pelicans in.

01:19:23.075 --> 01:19:25.365
- No, I'm saying, I don't...
- What is going on, bruv? So...

01:19:25.453 --> 01:19:28.083
- Hey, dude came back. Pog.
- I'm Pog.

01:19:28.205 --> 01:19:30.745
- I, er, work for Toke Records.
- Toke Records, there it is.

01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:32.003
- Did you write that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:32.084 --> 01:19:34.674
Like I write the raps,
but also make little backing tracks,

01:19:34.795 --> 01:19:35.995
like, on my laptop.

01:19:36.088 --> 01:19:37.571
Have you ever demoed them properly?

01:19:37.631 --> 01:19:38.761
- Yeah. We're always in the studio.
- No...

01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:42.841
- I'm trying to mix rap with real songs.
- I do my own songs as well.

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:44.578
- Are you his manager?
- A bit more than that.

01:19:44.638 --> 01:19:46.808
Yeah. Come on.

01:19:46.891 --> 01:19:48.811
- So...
- No, I'm solo.

01:19:48.893 --> 01:19:50.313
- Why are you lying?
- Right, yeah. Well, anyway,

01:19:50.436 --> 01:19:51.806
- give us a call and come in for a chat.
- Will do.

01:19:51.896 --> 01:19:53.476
- Yeah, wicked. Cheers, bruv.
- Yeah. Brilliant. Cheers.

01:19:53.606 --> 01:19:54.646
- Let's have a look at that.
- No, it's...

01:19:54.774 --> 01:19:56.444
What? What? I can't even look at it now?

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.592
What has gotten into you?

01:20:00.404 --> 01:20:02.034
"Tired of this rap race...

01:20:02.114 --> 01:20:04.914
"And that chase...

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:07.195
"That chase..."

01:20:15.127 --> 01:20:17.667
Are you gonna bother calling that Pog
for a meeting?

01:20:20.091 --> 01:20:22.616
- Yeah. Yeah, I thought I would.
- Yeah.

01:20:22.676 --> 01:20:24.466
- Hear him out and make a decision.
- Yeah.

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:25.893
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

01:20:26.013 --> 01:20:27.013
- No?
- No, you're all right.

01:20:27.098 --> 01:20:29.468
So he doesn't think you're just a...

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:31.428
Some idiot off the street?

01:20:31.519 --> 01:20:33.809
That you got the big boys
behind you if you want.

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:35.629
I just wanna go and see
what he's got to say...

01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:37.439
- Right, and...
- ...and... Yeah.

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:41.321
You want them to tear you a new one,
do you?

01:20:41.445 --> 01:20:44.315
And screw you? 'Cause that's what they do.

01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:46.238
- Yeah?
- No.

01:20:46.325 --> 01:20:48.025
- I'm gonna hear him out.
- No!

01:20:48.119 --> 01:20:51.369
Ah, you're gonna hear him out, okay.

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:53.647
- I'm just gonna finish this line.
- Yeah.

01:20:53.707 --> 01:20:56.537
- This verse.
- Have you got a rhyme for "gullible"?

01:21:02.842 --> 01:21:04.722
Day off today.

01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.390
I tried to get a gig in tonight
but I couldn't,

01:21:08.514 --> 01:21:10.854
so I'm just chillaxing all day.

01:21:12.184 --> 01:21:13.894
Not bad, is it?

01:21:13.978 --> 01:21:16.728
So, here he is.

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:19.113
What are you doing today?

01:21:19.191 --> 01:21:21.675
I'm going home.
I live about four miles away.

01:21:21.735 --> 01:21:23.735
I'm staying. I've paid for it.

01:21:26.782 --> 01:21:30.684
Final gig tomorrow.
I've saved the best till last. Typical.

01:21:30.744 --> 01:21:32.914
Um, we're gonna do a Christmas song.

01:21:32.997 --> 01:21:36.077
I've had it for a while, actually,
and it's based on a true story.

01:21:36.167 --> 01:21:40.297
Um, I read about this, uh, orphan kid
in the local paper.

01:21:40.379 --> 01:21:45.299
Um, he was dying and he just wanted
to stay alive till Christmas.

01:21:45.384 --> 01:21:48.434
And this sort of imagines
me singing to him,

01:21:48.554 --> 01:21:49.934
with all the stuff
that he's going through,

01:21:50.014 --> 01:21:52.434
not to worry, because Santa's coming.
It's really sweet.

01:21:52.558 --> 01:21:54.888
Um, and I've arranged for snow to fall.

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:56.937
Magic moment. Production value.

01:21:57.021 --> 01:21:58.151
- David, sorry.
- Yeah.

01:21:58.230 --> 01:21:59.610
I meant to say,
I heard back from the hire company.

01:21:59.732 --> 01:22:00.692
Yep.

01:22:00.774 --> 01:22:05.204
The snow is gonna cost 1,500 quid.
So, you know, not worth it really.

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:07.821
Well, none of it's been worth it, has it?
So...

01:22:07.948 --> 01:22:11.908
The whole tour's been... 20 grand down.

01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:13.727
I thought there'd be incomings.
There wasn't.

01:22:13.787 --> 01:22:15.407
Just all outgoings.

01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:18.249
Might as well just spend
another 1,500 quid and...

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:20.734
Well, no, I mean that's... Don't do that.

01:22:20.794 --> 01:22:23.254
That's throwing good money
after bad, David.

01:22:24.465 --> 01:22:27.925
- Just cut your losses.
- If I cut my losses...

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:31.430
Why? You know,
I thought it'd be a tour with a band.

01:22:31.555 --> 01:22:33.747
It's not a band. They're not even
staying here on their day off.

01:22:33.807 --> 01:22:36.017
They're away. No one's come to see us.

01:22:36.143 --> 01:22:38.393
We're not gonna get signed. So...

01:22:38.479 --> 01:22:39.849
So don't waste more money.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.400
Why not?

01:22:41.482 --> 01:22:43.652
What, why not? Why not what?

01:22:44.818 --> 01:22:46.188
Do you think I'm a prat?

01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:48.861
No. No.

01:22:49.823 --> 01:22:50.823
I think...

01:22:52.284 --> 01:22:53.794
To be honest, I think you're...

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.253
I think you're chasing something that...

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:58.042
- I can't have.
- ...that you don't need.

01:22:58.165 --> 01:23:00.665
That's not gonna... That's not gonna help.

01:23:00.793 --> 01:23:03.963
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I think...

01:23:04.046 --> 01:23:07.796
You seem to think
that unless you're on stage performing,

01:23:07.883 --> 01:23:09.783
that people aren't gonna like you.

01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:12.510
They're probably not.

01:23:12.638 --> 01:23:15.848
Well, then why would you wanna be liked
by people like that anyway?

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:18.980
You know, you don't have to be on stage
to be worth something.

01:23:21.021 --> 01:23:24.861
And people who like you are still gonna
like you even if you're not performing.

01:23:25.818 --> 01:23:28.858
Problem is not a lot of people like me,
do they?

01:23:30.864 --> 01:23:33.494
Don't spend any more money
on this tour, okay? Please?

01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:38.870
Don't cash in another pension or whatever.
I'll do the rest for free.

01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:43.333
- The snow costs 1,500 quid, so you...
- We don't need snow, David.

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.670
We don't need it.

01:23:45.879 --> 01:23:49.669
And... for the record, I like you.

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:55.428
- Yeah?
- Don't make me say it again.

01:23:55.514 --> 01:23:58.024
- All right? Have a good day.
- See you later.

01:24:03.897 --> 01:24:07.027
Dan's right. We don't need snow.

01:24:08.902 --> 01:24:10.844
I'm usually really good with budgets.

01:24:10.904 --> 01:24:14.124
But I never dreamt so few people
would wanna come along and see us.

01:24:14.241 --> 01:24:15.241
You know, I was...

01:24:16.368 --> 01:24:19.038
If the gigs would have sold out,
I would have only lost about eight grand.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:22.786
Which is fine, particularly if a record
company would have liked us.

01:24:23.334 --> 01:24:24.384
But...

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:31.546
I just wanted some shitty snow.
Just as a magic moment, you know.

01:24:37.681 --> 01:24:43.877
# Don't cry, it's Christmas
Santa's coming soon

01:24:43.937 --> 01:24:47.977
# Though you ain't got a mummy or daddy

01:24:48.108 --> 01:24:50.608
# Santa still loves you

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.410
# And he's riding on his reindeer

01:24:54.531 --> 01:24:57.411
It's been an interesting tour, this.

01:24:57.534 --> 01:25:00.914
Um, I think we possibly took it all
a little bit too seriously

01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:02.906
when we were in the middle of it all.

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:07.538
Um, but, actually, it's definitely one
of the funniest tours I've ever been on.

01:25:07.628 --> 01:25:08.628
I quite like Brent.

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:15.888
# Don't cry, it's Christmas
Santa's feeling fine

01:25:15.969 --> 01:25:19.179
# Though you know you'll never see him

01:25:19.973 --> 01:25:22.813
# He's not just in your mind

01:25:22.935 --> 01:25:28.922
# And it's not that he's invisible
It's because you're going blind

01:25:28.982 --> 01:25:35.532
# But don't cry, it's Christmas
Santa's feeling fine

01:25:36.115 --> 01:25:39.905
You know what? End of the day,
it's better than a proper job.

01:25:39.993 --> 01:25:41.543
Like it's... it's been all right.

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:45.120
Few drinks, few gigs.

01:25:46.458 --> 01:25:47.878
Could have been worse.

01:25:48.001 --> 01:25:53.841
# Though he's got a billion children
He's only got one day

01:25:55.008 --> 01:26:00.678
# You've got slightly less than that
If I were you I'd pray

01:26:00.806 --> 01:26:04.386
# But don't cry, it's Christmas

01:26:04.476 --> 01:26:07.766
# Everything's okay

01:26:14.486 --> 01:26:17.356
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:26:17.448 --> 01:26:21.078
- # It's Christmas
- # It's Christmas

01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:23.977
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:26:24.037 --> 01:26:27.917
- # It's Christmas
- # It's Christmas

01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:30.631
I may have been an idiot,
but I paid for the snow.

01:26:31.295 --> 01:26:34.205
Yes, of course it's a waste of money.
It's a huge waste of money.

01:26:34.298 --> 01:26:37.878
Um, but at least it's my money.
At least it's not more of his.

01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:40.890
And, to be fair,
I've made more than enough out of him.

01:26:41.013 --> 01:26:44.273
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:26:44.391 --> 01:26:47.061
- # It's Christmas
- # It's Christmas

01:26:47.853 --> 01:26:50.733
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:26:50.856 --> 01:26:54.396
- # It's Christmas
- # It's Christmas

01:26:54.485 --> 01:26:57.105
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:26:57.237 --> 01:27:01.014
- # It's Christmas
- # It's Christmas

01:27:01.074 --> 01:27:04.017
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:27:04.077 --> 01:27:06.447
# It's Christmas #

01:27:28.644 --> 01:27:31.044
I don't need to be a rock star, you know?

01:27:31.104 --> 01:27:33.064
That's just something I enjoy doing.

01:27:33.941 --> 01:27:36.571
I can live without being "a success."

01:27:37.569 --> 01:27:38.569
But, um...

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.055
I couldn't have lived without trying.

01:27:42.115 --> 01:27:43.155
And I did that.

01:27:44.117 --> 01:27:46.867
So... And everything works out,
doesn't it?

01:27:46.954 --> 01:27:49.062
You think you want one thing
along the way,

01:27:49.122 --> 01:27:52.065
and then you realise
you needed something else.

01:27:52.125 --> 01:27:56.745
Life's a struggle...
with little beautiful surprises

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.130
that make you wanna carry on
through all the shit

01:28:00.259 --> 01:28:03.179
to the next little beautiful surprise.

01:28:03.303 --> 01:28:04.763
So, yeah,

01:28:05.806 --> 01:28:07.006
all good.

01:28:10.269 --> 01:28:12.139
He's back.

01:28:12.271 --> 01:28:13.691
Christ. See you, Kaz.

01:28:14.815 --> 01:28:17.155
- Did you miss me?
- Did you have fun?

01:28:17.483 --> 01:28:21.497
Fun's not the word.
Ooh, yeah. Yeah, it was fun.

01:28:23.407 --> 01:28:24.737
- Here he comes.
- Come on.

01:28:24.825 --> 01:28:27.325
What resilience from a human being.

01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:29.102
I've never known anyone like him.

01:28:32.165 --> 01:28:33.825
- How are you?
- Buzzing, mate.

01:28:33.959 --> 01:28:35.589
- Good.
- Absolutely buzzing.

01:28:35.711 --> 01:28:37.501
- Yes, mate.
- Best time of my life.

01:28:37.588 --> 01:28:40.113
And everything worked out brilliant,
you know.

01:28:40.173 --> 01:28:41.383
Dom's got a little record deal.

01:28:41.508 --> 01:28:43.116
# If I am who I think I am

01:28:43.176 --> 01:28:45.176
# Then I gotta transform
Be a better man #

01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:48.180
Making a single. Toke Records.

01:28:48.307 --> 01:28:50.767
I invited them down.
I said, "Come out and check out this kid".

01:28:50.851 --> 01:28:53.141
They went, "All right". Boom.

01:28:53.228 --> 01:28:55.308
The band are on tour with Peter Andre.

01:28:55.397 --> 01:28:56.857
So they've fallen on their feet.

01:28:56.982 --> 01:28:59.442
# Oh, oh, oh

01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:03.818
# Mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you #

01:29:03.947 --> 01:29:06.737
And I've worked out, if I do overtime,

01:29:06.825 --> 01:29:09.235
work Saturdays
for about eight or nine months,

01:29:09.369 --> 01:29:12.079
I can do it all again. Just call them up.

01:29:12.205 --> 01:29:14.865
"It's back on.
We're gonna kick some more arse."

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.790
Brent? Got Bob Wonk on the phone.

01:29:16.877 --> 01:29:19.417
- He needs jam rags ASAP.
- On it.

01:29:19.546 --> 01:29:21.336
Simon Cowell didn't sign you up, then?

01:29:24.468 --> 01:29:26.048
No. No.

01:29:27.804 --> 01:29:29.144
Banta.

01:29:29.222 --> 01:29:32.642
I feel... I do quite feel
sorry for him, to be honest.

01:29:32.768 --> 01:29:35.598
The boys here, they're quite rude to him.

01:29:35.687 --> 01:29:38.171
And I know he's obviously gone
on this tour and he's doing all that,

01:29:38.231 --> 01:29:40.231
but I kinda feel like...

01:29:40.359 --> 01:29:42.029
Sorry, I don't know
why I'm getting emotional.

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.190
I just feel like...

01:29:44.071 --> 01:29:46.701
I can see through it sometimes.

01:29:46.823 --> 01:29:48.243
His smiles.

01:29:49.368 --> 01:29:50.658
I hope he does well.

01:29:50.786 --> 01:29:52.236
They can laugh.

01:29:53.205 --> 01:29:54.245
They're no better than me.

01:29:55.248 --> 01:29:56.998
Just 'cause they're reps
who like being reps,

01:29:57.084 --> 01:29:58.794
and I'm a rep
who wants to be something else.

01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:02.840
With that attitude, they'll be reps
for the rest of their life.

01:30:04.424 --> 01:30:06.724
I might be a rep
for the rest of my life, but...

01:30:08.303 --> 01:30:09.643
I was a rock star once.

01:30:09.721 --> 01:30:11.261
Useless prick now though, ain't you?

01:30:13.266 --> 01:30:15.596
What are you good at, eh? Nothing.

01:30:17.104 --> 01:30:18.524
Fuck.

01:30:18.647 --> 01:30:21.187
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:30:21.274 --> 01:30:22.274
Knobhead.

01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:26.280
- I thought you was great.
- At what?

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.950
I came to see you play last week.

01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:32.225
Oh, I... I didn't see you.

01:30:32.285 --> 01:30:34.325
No, I just snuck in.
I didn't wanna put you off.

01:30:35.454 --> 01:30:36.504
Cheers.

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:41.461
- Want a coffee?
- No, I'm... Got a free one coming.

01:30:43.296 --> 01:30:44.296
Costa.

01:30:45.549 --> 01:30:47.299
Actually, I got two coming, I think.

01:30:48.677 --> 01:30:50.547
- Do you want one?
- Yes, please.

01:30:51.304 --> 01:30:53.144
Two coffees, coming up.

01:30:54.891 --> 01:30:57.311
- Shall I come with you?
- If you want. Yeah.

01:31:00.313 --> 01:31:01.653
Oh, God.

01:31:04.443 --> 01:31:07.903
Oh, trust me.
I'm already thinking of a new song.

01:31:07.988 --> 01:31:10.108
- Just from going for coffee?
- Yeah. It's what I do.

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:12.198
I sort of take everyday situations,

01:31:12.325 --> 01:31:16.195
and then I look at them
from a different perspective.

01:31:16.329 --> 01:31:19.209
It's gonna be a Coldplay vibe, I think.
'Cause that's what Chris Martin does.

01:31:19.332 --> 01:31:21.502
He gets really mundane things

01:31:21.585 --> 01:31:25.205
and he makes them about the universe,
and stars, and electricity and shit, so...

01:31:25.338 --> 01:31:27.798
- It's interesting.
- Yeah, probably stick it in C major.

01:31:27.924 --> 01:31:30.283
- Is that your favourite chord?
- Just a bit, yeah.

01:31:30.343 --> 01:31:32.223
Guilty.

01:31:34.347 --> 01:31:37.307
# I was looking up to heaven

01:31:37.392 --> 01:31:40.942
# It was right under my nose

01:31:41.021 --> 01:31:44.297
# I had travelled many light years

01:31:44.357 --> 01:31:46.937
# It was right across the road

01:31:48.361 --> 01:31:51.741
# A billion trillion grains of stardust

01:31:51.823 --> 01:31:55.203
# Floating round in space

01:31:55.327 --> 01:31:58.037
# Two of them collided

01:31:58.163 --> 01:32:02.003
# In an ordinary place

01:32:02.125 --> 01:32:05.335
# We are electricity

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:08.300
# We will never die

01:32:08.381 --> 01:32:10.323
# We'll just burn and burst

01:32:10.383 --> 01:32:12.553
# And return to the sky

01:32:26.024 --> 01:32:29.342
# This world can't contain you

01:32:29.402 --> 01:32:32.822
# Gravity won't restrain you

01:32:32.948 --> 01:32:34.448
# Fly with me

01:32:34.574 --> 01:32:36.349
# High with me

01:32:36.409 --> 01:32:43.289
# High

01:32:43.416 --> 01:32:46.416
# We are electricity

01:32:46.545 --> 01:32:49.375
# We will never die

01:32:49.464 --> 01:32:51.594
# We'll just burn and burst

01:32:51.675 --> 01:32:53.545
# And return to the sky

01:32:53.635 --> 01:32:56.755
# We are electricity

01:32:56.847 --> 01:33:01.177
# The universe reflects in you and me

01:33:01.268 --> 01:33:03.598
# We're electricity

01:33:03.687 --> 01:33:07.307
# The universe reflected

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.400
# We are electricity

01:33:10.485 --> 01:33:14.655
# The universe reflects in you and me

01:33:14.781 --> 01:33:17.201
# We're electricity

01:33:17.284 --> 01:33:21.084
# Just when I least expected

01:33:21.204 --> 01:33:24.294
# We are electricity

01:33:24.416 --> 01:33:28.496
# The universe reflects in you and me

01:33:28.628 --> 01:33:30.918
# We're electricity

01:33:31.047 --> 01:33:35.467
# Just when I least expected

01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:48.421
# Half a tank should get me to Millbank

01:33:48.481 --> 01:33:52.151
# I fill her up and head down to Sidcup

01:33:52.277 --> 01:33:55.947
# It's just a meeting
It's only fleeting

01:33:56.072 --> 01:33:59.952
# It's just a pitch
And then I'm up to Ipswich

01:34:00.076 --> 01:34:02.446
# Life on the road

01:34:03.496 --> 01:34:05.656
# Don't need a heavy load

01:34:07.125 --> 01:34:10.443
# Foot down to the floor

01:34:10.503 --> 01:34:14.383
# Seventy miles an hour
But no more

01:34:22.265 --> 01:34:25.675
# Wheeler dealing no feeling

01:34:25.769 --> 01:34:29.462
# Strictly business
I'm killin' it in Widnes

01:34:29.522 --> 01:34:33.466
# Then to Gloucester
I get a Costa

01:34:33.526 --> 01:34:37.276
# Hard shoulder
Coffee holder

01:34:37.364 --> 01:34:39.534
# Life on the road

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:44.080
# Don't need a heavy load

01:34:44.162 --> 01:34:47.792
# Foot down to the floor

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:51.484
# Seventy miles an hour
But never more

01:35:07.018 --> 01:35:09.308
# Life on the road

01:35:10.563 --> 01:35:12.903
# Don't need a heavy load

01:35:13.942 --> 01:35:17.510
