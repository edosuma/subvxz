-(chain jingling)

00:21.687 --> 00:25.093
Get down here! Now!

00:26.262 --> 00:28.868
Sam just left.
He is going to kill his father.

00:28.934 --> 00:30.671
-What did you say to him?
-He decided

00:30.738 --> 00:32.843
that killing his father
would make him better.

00:32.909 --> 00:34.212
Would it?

00:34.278 --> 00:36.049
Well, no, I don't think so.

00:36.116 --> 00:37.819
He could come back here and...

00:37.885 --> 00:39.422
Are you sure it won't work?

00:39.489 --> 00:44.733
(sighs) Candace, I understand
that this man was brutal to you.

00:44.799 --> 00:47.171
But I'm supposed to care
what happens to him?

00:47.237 --> 00:50.511
Well... yes. Yes, a little.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.416
(doorbell rings)

01:06.309 --> 01:08.413
Can I come in?

01:21.239 --> 01:23.343
You hungry?

01:35.969 --> 01:37.872
(footsteps descending stairs)

01:46.891 --> 01:49.295
I've been in this position
many times.

01:49.361 --> 01:51.767
There's nothing you can do.

01:52.836 --> 01:56.810
I usually have a beer
and try to relax.

02:05.227 --> 02:07.064
(chain jingling)

02:07.131 --> 02:09.836

(sighs)

02:43.872 --> 02:45.775
(urinating)

03:02.775 --> 03:05.748
You think I'm some sort
of a monster, too.

03:08.186 --> 03:10.491
But I'm not.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.531
I'm like anybody else.

03:13.598 --> 03:18.273
When he's... out, like now...

03:18.339 --> 03:20.645
I'm so scared for him.

03:20.711 --> 03:25.788
I'm so sad for
the life he's living.

03:30.030 --> 03:35.541
But the families...
the people he does this to...

03:36.877 --> 03:39.549
I make up stories
in my head about them.

03:39.616 --> 03:42.154
I live it, in a way.

03:42.220 --> 03:46.162
I picture... them as babies,

03:46.228 --> 03:48.834
with their mothers holding them.

03:48.901 --> 03:52.441
Their fathers playing
with them on the floor.

03:54.879 --> 03:58.386
These poor men.

03:58.453 --> 04:00.925
But you won't call the police?

04:00.992 --> 04:06.570
Candace... you won't
save them from this?

04:08.641 --> 04:10.410
I can't.

04:12.147 --> 04:14.519
I cannot.

04:21.667 --> 04:22.802
God.

(plates clinking)

04:43.310 --> 04:44.712
(sighs)

04:55.835 --> 04:59.341
Why did you used to hit me
so much when I was a kid?

05:02.214 --> 05:03.851
(sighs heavily)

05:05.387 --> 05:06.957
I don't know.

05:10.798 --> 05:15.507
How did it make you feel?
When you...?

05:16.275 --> 05:17.979
What?

05:20.117 --> 05:24.392
When you used to hit me
all the time.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.131
How did it make you feel?

05:27.197 --> 05:31.405
(sighs) I don't know.

05:31.472 --> 05:34.111
Bad, I guess.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.618
You were a weird kid.

05:37.685 --> 05:41.560
You couldn't follow rules,
you couldn't play games,

05:41.626 --> 05:44.465
you didn't have any friends.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.137
And your mother was
reading all her books,

05:47.204 --> 05:50.811
telling me it was all my fault
you were like that.

05:52.248 --> 05:54.786
Anyway, I'm sorry.

06:05.306 --> 06:06.810
(grunting)

06:13.624 --> 06:15.628
(straining)

06:31.860 --> 06:34.431
(wheezes)

06:42.448 --> 06:45.186
My therapist said
not to kill you.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.802
And then I left.

06:54.338 --> 06:56.008
How do you feel?

06:57.912 --> 07:03.524
I was choking him and I could
feel him disappearing,

07:03.591 --> 07:05.828
and I stopped.

07:07.499 --> 07:09.702
It was like I didn't want to.

07:11.072 --> 07:12.576
Why not?

07:12.642 --> 07:14.813
I-I don't know.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.119
I mean, he said he was sorry,
but fuck him, right?

07:18.186 --> 07:21.927
I just, I hate him so much

07:21.994 --> 07:24.967
and usually that feeling,
it makes me want to

07:25.033 --> 07:27.605
go ahead and...

07:27.672 --> 07:30.978
But I was on top of him,
and I hated him.

07:31.045 --> 07:37.324
And this time, that feeling,
it-it made me not want to.

07:37.391 --> 07:39.962
I...

07:41.098 --> 07:42.735
Hmm.

07:42.802 --> 07:45.473
Do you know why I didn't do it?

07:47.210 --> 07:49.883
What was different,
between your father,

07:49.950 --> 07:52.253
and everyone else
that you've hurt?

07:54.325 --> 07:55.594
I don't know.

07:55.661 --> 07:58.600
What's the obvious difference?

07:59.836 --> 08:01.472
He hurt me the most.

08:01.539 --> 08:04.011
Okay, good. What else?

08:04.077 --> 08:07.551
What's the most
obvious difference?

08:11.058 --> 08:13.196
He's my father.

08:13.262 --> 08:15.501
Right.

08:15.568 --> 08:17.705
Sam, you were on top of him...

08:17.772 --> 08:21.780
the one who treated you
like this.

08:21.846 --> 08:25.788
If you killed him,
you'd be doing it, too.

08:25.854 --> 08:27.357
Acting just like him.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.194
Being just like him.

08:29.261 --> 08:30.463
You hate that part of him.

08:30.531 --> 08:33.103
You are trying to be different.

08:33.169 --> 08:36.109
Trying to get rid of
that ugly part of him

08:36.175 --> 08:37.878
that lives inside of you.

08:37.945 --> 08:42.689
You were right to
confront your father.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.793
But you didn't need to kill him.

08:44.859 --> 08:48.299
You needed to not kill him.

08:49.268 --> 08:52.675
This is it, Sam.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.011
It is a major breakthrough,

08:54.078 --> 08:57.484
even if you're not quite
feeling it yet.

08:57.552 --> 09:01.527
Not killing your father is...

09:01.593 --> 09:03.864
You wanted to change.

09:03.930 --> 09:07.638
Look at you. You've changed.

09:08.807 --> 09:11.613
How does it feel?

09:12.615 --> 09:14.953
Okay. I guess.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.925
It's everything that
we have been working towards.

09:17.992 --> 09:22.133
You-you stopped yourself.
This is extraordinary.

09:27.645 --> 09:29.181
Thanks.

09:29.248 --> 09:32.054
(takes deep breath)

09:32.121 --> 09:34.257
-(Sam laughs softly)
-Hmm.

09:35.460 --> 09:38.098
(exhales, laughs)

09:40.671 --> 09:42.541
I'm gonna go and
get some dinner.

09:42.608 --> 09:45.079
Uh, is there anything
in particular that you'd...

09:45.146 --> 09:47.552
I'm-I'm not really hungry
right now.

09:47.618 --> 09:51.158
I, um... Sam...

09:53.429 --> 09:57.270
It's time to let me go home.

09:58.406 --> 10:00.277
You're ready.

10:01.145 --> 10:03.783
And I need to get back
to my family.

10:06.121 --> 10:10.230
Sometimes therapists
talk with their patients

10:10.296 --> 10:11.566
about their own lives.

10:11.633 --> 10:15.473
Because... well, you know,
we're all human beings.

10:15.541 --> 10:19.014
We all are struggling,
every last one of us.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.222
So... I want you to understand
a few things about me.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.028
You have been struggling
with your father.

10:26.094 --> 10:28.032
And you just had
a big breakthrough.

10:28.099 --> 10:32.174
I'm in the middle of
a struggle with my son, too.

10:32.240 --> 10:36.248
And I need to get back to him
for our breakthrough.

10:37.017 --> 10:39.956
I did a lot of damage
to my son, too.

10:40.023 --> 10:42.895
I know it's not the same
as what your father did.

10:42.962 --> 10:49.241
But, Sam...
people don't deserve to die

10:49.308 --> 10:51.445
for falling short.

10:51.513 --> 10:53.617
No matter how short.

10:53.683 --> 10:58.727
We're all... broken vessels.

11:01.098 --> 11:03.904
I need to get back to my son.

11:05.608 --> 11:08.747
I want you to come see me in
my office for regular sessions,

11:08.814 --> 11:10.149
every day at first,

11:10.216 --> 11:13.890
but pretty soon we can
go to three days a week.

11:14.659 --> 11:16.963
I have enormous faith in you.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.136
I also want to address

11:20.203 --> 11:22.440
your completely understandable
concern, I assume,

11:22.508 --> 11:25.147
that, if you let me go,
I will turn you in.

11:25.213 --> 11:29.488
As a therapist, I have a
legal and ethical obligation

11:29.556 --> 11:31.459
to keep your confidence.

11:31.527 --> 11:34.431
Including any, um,

11:34.499 --> 11:36.803
crimes that you may have
committed in the past.

11:36.870 --> 11:41.747
It only gets thorny if you are
clearly going to kill somebody.

11:41.813 --> 11:43.382
And if, at some point
in the future,

11:43.449 --> 11:46.355
you have an overwhelming urge
to kill again,

11:46.422 --> 11:49.027
and you don't think
you'll be able to control it,

11:49.094 --> 11:50.998
that will be the moment for us

11:51.064 --> 11:53.837
to find a therapeutic
institution for you.

11:53.904 --> 11:55.974
But I don't see that happening.

11:56.041 --> 12:00.718
I think that, by not
killing your father,

12:00.784 --> 12:03.891
you have demonstrated
great progress

12:03.957 --> 12:06.328
and likely permanent change.

12:08.099 --> 12:09.835
I'm really proud of you.

12:09.902 --> 12:13.544
I am proud of the progress
that you have made.

12:13.610 --> 12:18.419
And I think that you will
continue to make progress.

he somehow managed

He needs a replacement father.

That's why he wants to keep you
here for the next ten years.

16:56.543 --> 17:00.116
He understands, maybe
intuitively, that he needs

17:00.182 --> 17:02.120
to do it again.

17:02.186 --> 17:05.426
To relive his life
with a different model.

I don't think that
I said what really

20:20.617 --> 20:23.421

And to know what I'm feeling.

I have something to say

20:39.722 --> 20:41.993

this process, though,

20:42.059 --> 20:44.331
honestly sharing the truth,

20:44.398 --> 20:46.702
even if it's hard.

20:52.113 --> 20:53.749
You brought me down here,

20:53.816 --> 20:57.657
and you asked me to treat you,
and I did.

21:00.129 --> 21:02.634
And I can't do it anymore.

21:04.370 --> 21:07.511
I have done the most I can.

21:07.578 --> 21:10.717
And I am telling you,
in my professional opinion,

21:10.784 --> 21:14.892
and I consider this
to be a near certainty,

21:14.959 --> 21:20.002
for you to get better, you
need to be physically stopped

21:20.068 --> 21:21.972
from acting out your compulsion.

21:22.039 --> 21:26.114
Being physically prevented
from hurting anyone else

21:26.181 --> 21:30.389
is what will give you
the freedom to actually heal

21:30.455 --> 21:32.427
your heart and your mind.

21:32.494 --> 21:35.266
It's what will give you
the space to heal

21:35.332 --> 21:36.702
what your father did to you.

21:36.769 --> 21:39.508
As much as it can be, Sam.

21:39.575 --> 21:42.581
That kind of pain

Sam, I have so much respect
for what you're trying to do.

21:52.233 --> 21:53.536
It's very brave.

21:53.602 --> 21:56.775
In the whole history of

21:56.842 --> 21:58.479

struggling with,

21:58.546 --> 22:01.018
I bet you stand alone

22:01.084 --> 22:03.990

your efforts to change.

22:05.861 --> 22:08.398
(sighs) And...

22:10.403 --> 22:13.676

turn yourself in.

22:13.743 --> 22:16.583
Call the police
and turn yourself in.

22:20.624 --> 22:23.729

22:26.468 --> 22:28.973
Our therapy is over.

22:29.742 --> 22:31.712
You need to make a choice.

22:31.779 --> 22:34.251
I'm making one,
and you have to make one, too.

22:34.317 --> 22:38.358
My choice is that I am not
doing therapy with you anymore.

22:38.425 --> 22:43.435
Your choice--
you can turn yourself in,

22:43.503 --> 22:47.443
or you can end this
the other way.

22:50.416 --> 22:53.389

22:53.456 --> 22:54.659
