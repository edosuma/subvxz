02:45.395 --> 02:46.595
Hi, Omer.

02:46.597 --> 02:47.963
Hello Jamila.

02:47.965 --> 02:49.231
You look beautiful.

02:49.233 --> 02:52.334
Thanks, but God,
I don't feel it.

02:52.336 --> 02:54.870
Ah, this is how
the world sees you.

02:54.872 --> 02:57.072
You are a gazelle.

02:57.074 --> 02:59.910
What you feel is
for yourself, no?

03:01.010 --> 03:02.378
I have something for you.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.680
What is it?

03:05.682 --> 03:06.614
It's nothing.

03:06.616 --> 03:07.850
It's for your little girl.

03:09.118 --> 03:11.352
Oh, my God, that's so pretty.

03:11.354 --> 03:13.888
Ruby's going to love this.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.691
Thank you so much Omer.

03:15.693 --> 03:17.625
It's nothing.

03:17.627 --> 03:19.528
It's too much money, really.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.129
No, no, really it's nothing.

03:21.131 --> 03:22.830
Pink is her favorite color.

03:22.832 --> 03:24.899
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:24.901 --> 03:26.035
Thank you, Omer.

03:28.237 --> 03:29.637
Namaste.

03:29.639 --> 03:30.473
Namaste.

03:36.979 --> 03:38.479
Lots of people tonight.

03:38.481 --> 03:39.515
More coming.

03:42.218 --> 03:43.518
Hello Jamila-moo.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.752
Hi, Kostas.

03:44.754 --> 03:46.421
How are you darling?

03:46.423 --> 03:49.156
Well, I didn't
have a great day.

03:49.158 --> 03:49.990
No?

03:49.992 --> 03:50.826
No.

03:50.828 --> 03:52.094
Don't worry about it.

03:52.096 --> 03:53.227
Tomorrow will be
better, all right.

03:53.229 --> 03:54.495
Just be strong darling.

03:54.497 --> 03:56.163
A lot of people.

03:56.165 --> 03:57.698
Yes, and I need you out there

03:57.700 --> 03:59.601
in about a half an hour.

03:59.603 --> 04:02.770
On table 12, six more
people are coming.

04:02.772 --> 04:04.606
We're gonna make
money tonight darling.

04:04.608 --> 04:05.540
I need it.

04:05.542 --> 04:06.907
You need it, we all need.

04:06.909 --> 04:08.609
You want more you poor Greek.

04:08.611 --> 04:11.747
Omer Lagas, Omer Lagas,
he thinks I'm rich.

04:11.749 --> 04:13.382
With the money I'm paying you,

04:13.384 --> 04:14.582
I'm gonna close this room.

04:14.584 --> 04:15.750
I'm gonna go bankrupt.

04:15.752 --> 04:18.652
Here's your meat
platter, you Greek pig.

04:18.654 --> 04:21.156
Thank you, you
Turkish bastard.

04:21.158 --> 04:23.591
We love each other.

04:31.735 --> 04:32.567
Hi, baby.

04:32.569 --> 04:33.435
Hi.

04:33.437 --> 04:34.301
How was the hearing?

04:34.303 --> 04:35.536
Don't ask.

04:35.538 --> 04:37.471
Oh, trust me, I know
the shit that you mean.

04:37.473 --> 04:39.707
Where's the white
plate for table seven?

04:39.709 --> 04:41.009
One minute!

04:41.011 --> 04:43.545
Jesus,
I can hear you.

05:03.766 --> 05:05.300
Well, you have your
milk now sweetheart

05:05.302 --> 05:07.771
and do everything
Jenny says, okay?

05:08.704 --> 05:09.772
Yeah.

05:12.276 --> 05:15.276
Well, daddy is very
naughty, remember,

05:15.278 --> 05:17.581
and we don't like him anymore.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.949
That's right, Ruby.

05:20.951 --> 05:22.419
You have your milk now, okay?

05:24.454 --> 05:25.719
Yes.

05:25.721 --> 05:27.788
He lives with that wicked witch

05:27.790 --> 05:29.591
and maybe one day
she'll fly away

05:29.593 --> 05:31.058
on her broomstick

05:31.060 --> 05:33.096
and then daddy will
be able to come home.

05:34.531 --> 05:35.999
Yes, he will.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.134
Okay, sweetheart.

05:39.136 --> 05:40.534
I love you.

05:40.536 --> 05:41.370
Bye.

05:45.242 --> 05:47.675
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:47.677 --> 05:48.812
Hello again, hello.

05:49.879 --> 05:51.947
Tonight we have with us

05:51.949 --> 05:53.481
a very special guest

05:53.483 --> 05:56.017
all the way from Cairo,
beautiful Zabella.

05:56.019 --> 05:56.853
Yes.

06:01.391 --> 06:04.793
This lovely girl was
arrested in Cairo.

06:04.795 --> 06:08.396
You know why, because
the thought her dancing

06:08.398 --> 06:10.734
was very sexy.

06:12.101 --> 06:14.002
She came here to Australia

06:14.004 --> 06:15.269
to find her life.

06:15.271 --> 06:18.139
First thing I tell her
is here in Australia,

06:18.141 --> 06:21.575
you get arrested if not sexy.

06:23.579 --> 06:25.649
Anyway, apparently-

06:27.617 --> 06:28.550
- He's on drugs tonight.

06:28.552 --> 06:29.817
Tell him to fucking stop.

06:29.819 --> 06:31.051
Other plans.

06:31.053 --> 06:33.255
But she was because she
had color skin, what?

06:38.795 --> 06:41.029
Okay, anyway.

06:41.031 --> 06:42.964
You will see with
your eyes, no worries.

06:42.966 --> 06:46.034
And the next thing
is that the person,

06:46.036 --> 06:47.334
the first person that gets up

06:47.336 --> 06:49.103
and dances with
beautiful Zabella,

06:49.105 --> 06:51.873
has got an Ouzo on Kostas.

06:51.875 --> 06:55.345
Beautiful Zabella, ladies
and gentlemen, yes.

07:36.252 --> 07:38.485
What do you think of her boy?

07:38.487 --> 07:40.255
She's hot.

07:40.257 --> 07:42.324
A young girl like
that shouldn't have

07:42.326 --> 07:44.192
so many worries.

07:44.194 --> 07:45.426
I would ask her out,

07:45.428 --> 07:47.394
but my parents want
me to marry a girl

07:47.396 --> 07:49.165
back in India with a dowry.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.334
And she's divorced with a child.

07:53.336 --> 07:54.735
So what?

07:54.737 --> 07:56.204
I can't be serious about her.

07:56.206 --> 07:58.473
My parents won't accept her.

07:58.475 --> 07:59.707
Why not?

07:59.709 --> 08:01.711
Well, because it's
against our religion.

08:02.579 --> 08:04.579
You know what religion is boy?

08:04.581 --> 08:05.880
What?

08:05.882 --> 08:08.382
Fuck you, that's what.

08:08.384 --> 08:10.084
Maybe for you, easy to say.

08:10.086 --> 08:11.820
Yeah, yeah.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.788
What till it fucks
you, then see.

08:29.673 --> 08:30.506
Wow.

08:51.461 --> 08:52.627
Aha.

08:52.629 --> 08:54.364
I you're in the trap.

08:59.403 --> 09:02.837
Oh, my God, Jamila is
slacking it up out there.

09:02.839 --> 09:04.138
She is so good.

09:06.842 --> 09:08.609
Hey, I've got 41.

09:08.611 --> 09:09.879
Right, I need a ciggie.

09:16.852 --> 09:17.819
Have you caught it yet Omer?

09:17.821 --> 09:18.820
No.

09:18.822 --> 09:21.057
Bastard doesn't like chicken.

09:22.591 --> 09:24.425
They're like koalas bruh.

09:24.427 --> 09:25.759
They only eat leaves.

09:25.761 --> 09:27.897
Try some coslins.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.368
He thinks he's smart.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.638
What are you gonna do
with it if you catch it?

09:37.640 --> 09:39.942
Put it in Kosta's car.

09:43.312 --> 09:44.512
Serious?

09:44.514 --> 09:46.547
Yeah, he will
drive home with it.

09:50.153 --> 09:52.686
Oh, he's gonna
shit himself baby.

09:52.688 --> 09:55.589
Don't say that crap about
me being arrested in Cairo.

09:57.561 --> 09:59.194
I just said all these
things out there

09:59.196 --> 10:00.594
for you to get more tips.

10:00.596 --> 10:03.263
I don't want any
more shit out there.

10:03.265 --> 10:04.866
You know they're trying
to make me look like

10:04.868 --> 10:05.800
a bad mother.

10:05.802 --> 10:07.901
Come on, come on, sit down.

10:07.903 --> 10:08.936
I'll fix you something to eat.

10:08.938 --> 10:10.504
Okay, sit, sit, sit, sit.

10:10.506 --> 10:11.940
Don't worry about
anything Jamila.

10:11.942 --> 10:12.775
Success.

10:15.678 --> 10:17.878
Yes, girl, you were amazing.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.546
Thanks.

10:19.548 --> 10:20.882
Hey, I seriously wanna learn.

10:20.884 --> 10:22.119
It's easy.

10:23.919 --> 10:25.719
You should do lessons.

10:25.721 --> 10:26.921
Yeah.

10:26.923 --> 10:28.388
I know heaps of actresses

10:28.390 --> 10:30.824
that would love to add
another string to their bio.

10:30.826 --> 10:32.729
How was your audition?

10:34.998 --> 10:37.300
Aw, thanks for remembering.

10:38.368 --> 10:39.733
It was great.

10:39.735 --> 10:42.270
They actually said
that I was great.

10:42.272 --> 10:44.071
Great.

10:44.073 --> 10:45.507
I know, right?

10:45.509 --> 10:47.842
Like, I thought I
was pretty good,

10:47.844 --> 10:51.679
but great was amazing to hear.

10:51.681 --> 10:52.980
When do you find out?

10:52.982 --> 10:53.948
Soon.

10:53.950 --> 10:54.785
I hope.

10:56.485 --> 10:57.653
How about you?

10:58.822 --> 11:00.722
Hey, if you need a
character reference

11:00.724 --> 11:01.890
or anything like that,

11:01.892 --> 11:04.526
I am more than
happy to help, okay?

11:04.528 --> 11:05.361
Thanks.

11:08.298 --> 11:09.265
Hey.

11:10.399 --> 11:12.134
I think everything's
gonna work out.

11:19.042 --> 11:21.411
Thanks guys,
have a great night.

11:23.113 --> 11:24.878
Hi, do you have a booking?

11:24.880 --> 11:25.814
Yeah, Rebecca.

11:25.816 --> 11:26.781
Yeah, sure just take a seat.

11:26.783 --> 11:28.384
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

11:39.562 --> 11:41.195
Did you get legal aid?

11:41.197 --> 11:42.198
Yeah.

11:43.133 --> 11:44.565
It was so depressing.

11:44.567 --> 11:47.334
That bitch didn't
even remember my name.

11:47.336 --> 11:48.869
I was just a case number.

11:48.871 --> 11:50.637
What hope is there really?

11:50.639 --> 11:51.940
Come on Jamila.

11:51.942 --> 11:53.708
They don't take a
child from mother.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.008
Yes, they do.

11:55.010 --> 11:57.847
If you have money, the
law is on your side.

11:59.048 --> 12:02.617
They made up horrible
things about me Omer.

12:02.619 --> 12:04.084
I have read them.

12:04.086 --> 12:07.155
Even started to
believe them myself.

12:07.157 --> 12:09.022
Everything will be okay.

12:09.024 --> 12:10.860
You can't say
that, you don't know.

12:13.964 --> 12:16.598
You know what that
cunt said to me?

12:16.600 --> 12:18.498
That I need to face the facts.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.768
I could lose custody of Ruby.

12:21.770 --> 12:22.903
What the fuck is
she talking about?

12:22.905 --> 12:24.774
That's what she said to me.

12:25.642 --> 12:26.874
Jamila!

12:26.876 --> 12:29.042
I ran away from
persecution and war,

12:29.044 --> 12:31.478
but not even in Turkey
they don't do such a thing.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.147
It's all about the money here.

12:33.149 --> 12:35.449
They can buy Ruby from me.

12:35.451 --> 12:36.950
She's my little girl,

12:36.952 --> 12:39.255
but they can take her
away for no good reason.

12:45.061 --> 12:46.794
So, that's a Greek salad,

12:46.796 --> 12:48.228
a meat platter for three,

12:48.230 --> 12:49.998
a seafood platter for two

12:50.000 --> 12:52.367
and you want the dips
to come out first?

12:52.369 --> 12:53.300
Yes, why not.

12:53.302 --> 12:54.336
Okay, cool.

12:55.538 --> 12:57.704
Where are you from?

12:57.706 --> 12:59.075
L.A. honey.

13:02.479 --> 13:04.878
Kostas

13:04.880 --> 13:06.414
is gonna us into some
serious trouble one day.

13:11.888 --> 13:13.488
Rebecca.

13:13.490 --> 13:15.089
Rebecca, welcome.

13:15.091 --> 13:16.491
Kostas, muah, muah.

13:16.493 --> 13:19.026
Come darling,
you look so nice.

13:19.028 --> 13:19.862
Jesus.

13:23.299 --> 13:25.833
You come for the
belly dancing, yes?

13:25.835 --> 13:27.334
Well, yeah a little.

13:27.336 --> 13:28.835
Yes, yes.

13:28.837 --> 13:29.671
Arman.

13:29.673 --> 13:30.504
Kostas.

13:30.506 --> 13:31.472
Great place.

13:31.474 --> 13:33.307
That's okay.

13:33.309 --> 13:35.343
Friend of Rebecca's
is my friend.

13:35.345 --> 13:36.945
Okay, Arman, all right.

13:36.947 --> 13:38.146
So you eat.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.714
There is fantastic lamb
tonight, very good.

13:40.716 --> 13:42.349
Drink and I'll be back.

13:42.351 --> 13:44.151
Rebecca darling, it's so nice

13:44.153 --> 13:47.756
to see you after such
a long time, darling.

13:52.394 --> 13:55.063
Hey, you know your dancing
tonight was excellent.

13:55.065 --> 13:58.432
I think you should
be in Bolly movies.

13:58.434 --> 13:59.968
I wish.

13:59.970 --> 14:03.673
No, truly, you can be like
Recka, "Forever Beautiful."

14:09.913 --> 14:11.979
Are your parents helping you?

14:11.981 --> 14:13.515
With money?

14:14.951 --> 14:15.782
Well, yeah.

14:15.784 --> 14:16.617
No.

14:16.619 --> 14:17.721
They're poor.

14:19.422 --> 14:20.521
I wish they were in Australia.

14:20.523 --> 14:22.357
They could look after Ruby

14:22.359 --> 14:23.858
so I wouldn't have
to pay for a sitter.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.259
Must be really hard for you.

14:26.261 --> 14:28.664
Yeah, it is Samir.

14:30.933 --> 14:32.400
What do they think
about your divorce?

14:32.402 --> 14:35.402
I'm not divorced yet,
so they don't know.

14:35.404 --> 14:37.206
But they're not like that.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.111
My parents are.

14:45.148 --> 14:46.249
Hey, guys.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.884
Hey, table two is
howling, how long?

14:50.886 --> 14:52.619
Five minutes!

14:52.621 --> 14:55.958
Okay, you
don't have to yell at me.

15:14.811 --> 15:16.209
Oh, my God.

15:16.211 --> 15:17.744
Oh, my God, fuck.

15:17.746 --> 15:19.847
Fucking hell, he's here.

15:19.849 --> 15:21.081
Who?

15:21.083 --> 15:23.584
It's him, Arman
with his whore.

15:23.586 --> 15:24.986
Which one is he?

15:24.988 --> 15:28.156
The one near the
window, the blonde bitch.

15:28.158 --> 15:29.489
Oh, my God.

15:29.491 --> 15:32.060
He never took me out
when Ruby was born.

15:32.062 --> 15:35.228
Now look at him, looks
like a fucking gigolo.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.730
I have to go.

15:36.732 --> 15:38.065
Don't worry
about him Jamila.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.335
No, I've got to go.

15:50.413 --> 15:51.679
What are doing?

15:51.681 --> 15:55.151
Omer, tell me how many
snappers have we got?

15:59.355 --> 16:00.188
Six.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.122
Six?

16:01.124 --> 16:02.757
Okay, where did Jamila go?

16:02.759 --> 16:04.927
She's going home.

16:06.995 --> 16:07.994
What?

16:07.996 --> 16:10.230
The husband is here.

16:10.232 --> 16:12.266
The husband is here where?

16:12.268 --> 16:13.103
Come.

16:14.169 --> 16:16.369
Front of the
window, first table.

16:16.371 --> 16:17.371
With Rebecca?

16:17.373 --> 16:18.372
Yeah.

16:18.374 --> 16:19.940
Where is Jamila?

16:19.942 --> 16:20.876
In the storeroom.

16:24.047 --> 16:24.878
Jamila love.

16:26.149 --> 16:26.982
Jamila.

16:29.852 --> 16:31.352
Jamila-moo.

16:31.354 --> 16:33.153
I'll be out in
a minute, I'm changing.

16:33.155 --> 16:35.724
Okay, darling, okay,
okay, thank you, sorry.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.527
Hey, what's everyone doing?

16:40.529 --> 16:41.697
Nothing.

16:43.232 --> 16:44.967
Table two is
gonna string me up.

16:50.173 --> 16:51.240
Jamila-moo.

16:54.244 --> 16:55.877
Come on darling, what's wrong.

16:55.879 --> 16:58.045
I have to go, I
cannot be seen here.

16:58.047 --> 16:59.046
Why?

16:59.048 --> 17:00.314
Because he'll see me.

17:00.316 --> 17:02.216
Who will see you,
I don't understand.

17:02.218 --> 17:05.452
I can't dance with Arman here.

17:05.454 --> 17:06.687
Why, darling?

17:06.689 --> 17:07.488
He knows that you
are a belly dancer.

17:07.490 --> 17:08.890
No, no, he doesn't.

17:08.892 --> 17:10.423
And if that bitch sees me,

17:10.425 --> 17:11.992
she'll tell her
lawyer I'm a stripper

17:11.994 --> 17:13.628
and I'll lose Ruby.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.595
Rebecca.

17:15.597 --> 17:16.730
You know her.

17:16.732 --> 17:17.664
I know her.

17:17.666 --> 17:19.132
She comes here for years.

17:19.134 --> 17:20.767
You know her.

17:20.769 --> 17:22.402
I have to go.

17:22.404 --> 17:24.404
Come on darling,
darling, darling, darling.

17:24.406 --> 17:26.073
What is this, this is our night.

17:26.075 --> 17:27.607
Where are you going?

17:27.609 --> 17:29.009
There is people
out there waiting.

17:29.011 --> 17:30.411
The belly dancer.

17:30.413 --> 17:32.246
What is this?

17:32.248 --> 17:34.649
I cannot dance Kostas.

17:34.651 --> 17:37.517
Jesus fucking Christ,
come on darling, come on.

17:37.519 --> 17:38.753
No, no.

17:38.755 --> 17:39.987
This is our night.

17:39.989 --> 17:40.955
We did it so nicely.

17:40.957 --> 17:42.222
Everybody's happy.

17:42.224 --> 17:43.591
You are so beautiful.

17:43.593 --> 17:44.892
You got the money,

17:44.894 --> 17:46.563
we talk all about this thing.

17:47.829 --> 17:48.730
I'll do it.

17:52.634 --> 17:53.836
I can do it.

17:55.337 --> 17:57.171
But I'll need some coaching.

17:57.173 --> 17:58.740
Okay by me.

18:02.077 --> 18:02.878
Bravo.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.014
Bravo, bravo.

18:07.016 --> 18:08.815
You will be great.

18:08.817 --> 18:10.151
Don't take that off because

18:10.153 --> 18:11.485
I need you on the floor, though.

18:11.487 --> 18:12.953
Hey, I can't do both.

18:12.955 --> 18:14.956
If I'm gonna dance, I
need time to rehearse.

18:14.958 --> 18:15.957
Okay.

18:15.959 --> 18:16.891
Well, I have to be paid

18:16.893 --> 18:18.092
for my time, too, Kostas.

18:18.094 --> 18:20.126
Yeah, ducks, okay,
then I'll keep the tips.

18:20.128 --> 18:21.696
Hey, that's not fair.

18:21.698 --> 18:23.163
The tips should be hers.

18:23.165 --> 18:24.498
Yeah, I'm the one
on show out there.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.999
Oh, you do get paid, though,

18:26.001 --> 18:28.568
and you get the tips
from the tables, come on.

18:28.570 --> 18:29.836
Give them to Jamila.

18:29.838 --> 18:31.205
Yeah, she's the
one needs it most.

18:31.207 --> 18:32.405
What do you mean?

18:32.407 --> 18:34.007
We all agree we
give them to Jamila?

18:34.009 --> 18:35.209
Yes.

18:35.211 --> 18:36.244
We all agree yes,
one, two, three.

18:36.246 --> 18:37.478
Yes.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.846
Okay, to Jamilia then,
to Jam, this is good.

18:39.848 --> 18:41.082
Okay.

18:41.084 --> 18:42.350
Okay, darling, okay.

18:42.352 --> 18:43.784
Where should we go?

18:43.786 --> 18:44.884
There's room in there.

18:44.886 --> 18:46.152
All right.

18:46.154 --> 18:48.555
Okay, ladies, please,
please, please, please.

18:48.557 --> 18:50.425
Boy, boy, boy, you'll be great.

18:53.028 --> 18:54.027
Hey, Kostas?

18:54.029 --> 18:55.263
What?

18:55.265 --> 18:57.131
This Rebecca,
she has money, no?

18:57.133 --> 18:58.865
She has money, yes.

18:58.867 --> 19:00.234
Has got millions.

19:00.236 --> 19:02.536
Her parents have got millions.

19:02.538 --> 19:03.903
They all own half
of Toorak, why?

19:03.905 --> 19:06.641
And she comes here to eat?

19:06.643 --> 19:08.142
Why not Ray?

19:08.144 --> 19:09.509
Get fuck Ray.

19:09.511 --> 19:11.478
Ray got to get fucked.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.646
This is the best place here.

19:12.648 --> 19:15.083
Crazy hey, how they turned up?

19:16.251 --> 19:18.419
Hard thing is actually
seeing them together.

19:18.421 --> 19:20.388
Like a couple.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.289
My Arman with her.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.026
It just doesn't make sense.

19:25.028 --> 19:27.295
Hey, uh, personal one,

19:27.297 --> 19:30.799
but, have you had
other boyfriends?

19:31.968 --> 19:33.199
No.

19:33.201 --> 19:35.102
Just Arman.

19:35.104 --> 19:36.304
He was my first.

19:36.306 --> 19:38.207
Was it a wedding night job?

19:39.275 --> 19:41.142
Yeah.

19:41.144 --> 19:44.077
We had to, they came
to look at the sheets.

19:44.079 --> 19:44.913
Really?

19:46.749 --> 19:49.049
That's fucked up.

19:49.051 --> 19:51.451
Shit, sorry.

19:51.453 --> 19:53.153
No, no, it's okay.

19:53.155 --> 19:54.220
I know this whole thing

19:54.222 --> 19:55.756
must seem so stupid to you.

19:55.758 --> 19:56.690
No, no, no, no.

19:56.692 --> 19:58.592
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

19:58.594 --> 20:01.128
That was really disrespectful.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.395
Please forgive me.

20:02.397 --> 20:04.032
It's okay.

20:05.134 --> 20:06.568
I did it for him.

20:08.371 --> 20:10.537
You know what?

20:10.539 --> 20:12.806
I think you should
go crazy for a while.

20:12.808 --> 20:13.641
Yeah.

20:13.643 --> 20:15.508
You are way overdue.

20:15.510 --> 20:16.677
Come on.

20:16.679 --> 20:18.645
Have some fun Jamila.

20:18.647 --> 20:22.182
Try anything and everything.

20:22.184 --> 20:24.785
Fulfill some fantasies.

20:24.787 --> 20:26.788
I don't think I have any.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.492
You must.

20:33.829 --> 20:34.864
Arman.

20:36.231 --> 20:39.299
He wanted to have a
threesome with another girl.

20:39.301 --> 20:40.936
I thought about that.

20:43.205 --> 20:45.171
Yeah, been there, done that.

20:45.173 --> 20:47.842
Mostly though, you end
up shagging the girl

20:47.844 --> 20:49.844
because most guys,

20:49.846 --> 20:51.713
they can't handle two women.

20:53.816 --> 20:55.617
That's not so bad, is it?

20:56.685 --> 20:57.919
Yeah.

20:59.154 --> 21:01.022
Yeah, I always
thought that, too.

21:03.792 --> 21:06.059
Where's the American chick?

21:06.061 --> 21:07.827
Oh, she'll be back
with a surprise.

21:07.829 --> 21:09.162
When is the belly
dancer coming?

21:09.164 --> 21:09.999
Soon.

21:11.701 --> 21:12.732
Where do you come from Arman?

21:12.734 --> 21:14.034
Armenia.

21:14.036 --> 21:15.068
Armenia, bravo.

21:15.070 --> 21:17.470
We met in an Uber.

21:17.472 --> 21:20.173
Yeah, he picked me up
after the Logie Awards.

21:20.175 --> 21:22.442
Yeah, you drive this Uber?

21:22.444 --> 21:24.812
Yeah, but I'm finishing
off my engineering degree.

21:24.814 --> 21:26.413
Bravo, bravo.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.649
We're getting married.

21:30.819 --> 21:31.651
What?

21:31.653 --> 21:34.287
We're getting married.

21:34.289 --> 21:35.623
You're getting married?

21:35.625 --> 21:37.557
Yeah.

21:37.559 --> 21:42.062
Congratulations bravo.

21:42.064 --> 21:45.533
What are you talking,
congratulations darling.

21:45.535 --> 21:46.600
Bravo, bravo Arman.

21:51.606 --> 21:52.873
This is beautiful.

21:52.875 --> 21:54.975
Third time lucky Kostas.

21:54.977 --> 21:56.643
Of course.

21:56.645 --> 21:57.878
You know what darling.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.114
You can get married as
many times as you like,

22:01.116 --> 22:03.118
as long as I get
to meet them all.

22:04.619 --> 22:06.085
Arman, right?

22:06.087 --> 22:08.389
Yes, and they all
have to love Greek food.

22:08.391 --> 22:10.257
Greek food, of course,

22:10.259 --> 22:11.725
that's good about it is.

22:11.727 --> 22:13.626
This one's the most
handsome, don't you think?

22:13.628 --> 22:14.461
Arman?

22:14.463 --> 22:15.397
Yes.

22:19.801 --> 22:21.101
How's your father?

22:21.103 --> 22:22.836
Well, he's retired.

22:22.838 --> 22:24.305
But you know what he's like.

22:24.307 --> 22:26.640
He's still taking on cases.

22:26.642 --> 22:29.075
Okay, Jules, that
Jules, you know Jules?

22:29.077 --> 22:30.411
Yeah.

22:30.413 --> 22:32.212
Best lawyer in Australia.

22:32.214 --> 22:33.980
You gotta be careful Arman.

22:33.982 --> 22:35.649
Yeah, I know, I've
seen him in action.

22:35.651 --> 22:37.284
You've seen him in action.

22:37.286 --> 22:38.419
This is very good.

22:38.421 --> 22:39.319
Of course.

22:39.321 --> 22:40.153
Kostas.

22:40.155 --> 22:40.988
The phone.

22:40.990 --> 22:41.855
The phone?

22:41.857 --> 22:42.989
It's Angelo.

22:42.991 --> 22:46.160
Ah, Angelo, my son.

22:46.162 --> 22:47.061
Okay.

22:47.063 --> 22:48.828
Eh, have fun.

22:48.830 --> 22:50.197
I'll be back soon.

22:50.199 --> 22:52.099
We're gonna dance
and we're gonna have

22:52.101 --> 22:53.901
a great night, all right.

22:53.903 --> 22:56.072
Okay, okay, see you, okay, bye.

23:00.675 --> 23:01.508
To the Goldmans.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.910
To the Goldmans.

23:02.912 --> 23:03.746
Yes.

23:05.314 --> 23:08.481
We always get what
we want in the end.

23:40.583 --> 23:43.017
Omer, Samir, leave these.

23:43.019 --> 23:47.020
Go out and give a hand
to Katerina on the floor.

23:47.022 --> 23:47.856
Okay.

24:02.305 --> 24:03.605
You all right?

24:13.548 --> 24:17.217
You know, you
try all your life

24:17.219 --> 24:20.621
the best for your
children, the best.

24:20.623 --> 24:21.654
Right.

24:21.656 --> 24:23.390
So they don't have a problem.

24:23.392 --> 24:27.227
Taverna here, two
houses, you know.

24:27.229 --> 24:31.267
And then you son turns
out to be a drug addict.

24:34.036 --> 24:36.005
At least you still have him.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.948
Bernard is 63 today.

24:48.416 --> 24:52.186
My children would be grown
up with our own families.

24:52.188 --> 24:56.289
I don't know why
that cunt took them,

24:56.291 --> 24:58.892
but you should love
every minute you have

24:58.894 --> 25:00.193
with your son.

25:00.195 --> 25:02.630
Drug addict or not drug addict.

25:02.632 --> 25:04.299
Who gives fuck?

25:12.040 --> 25:14.708
To Bernard.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.812
Happy birthday Bernard.

25:24.553 --> 25:26.120
What the fuck
are you two doing?

25:26.122 --> 25:28.391
I'm getting raped out there.

27:18.433 --> 27:19.365
What is it?

27:19.367 --> 27:20.269
Up there.

27:21.971 --> 27:23.873
Oh, it's horrible.

27:30.645 --> 27:32.714
We've got the mother
fucker.

27:33.883 --> 27:36.251
I can't come out
here and smoke anymore.

27:47.896 --> 27:48.730
Oh.

27:52.334 --> 27:54.068
I promise, I'll pay you
back when I get a job.

27:56.005 --> 27:58.471
Actually I just I
ran out of credit

27:58.473 --> 27:59.840
and the job
interviews I went for,

27:59.842 --> 28:01.644
they got my mobile number, so.

28:02.778 --> 28:03.610
Here.

28:03.612 --> 28:04.513
Angelo.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.015
Why don't you come and work here

28:08.017 --> 28:10.286
for a while at Taverna?

28:11.452 --> 28:13.719
You make some money
and then you learn

28:13.721 --> 28:14.720
how to run it.

28:14.722 --> 28:16.556
Listen, I'm an
architect, Papa.

28:16.558 --> 28:17.824
Hmm?

28:17.826 --> 28:19.860
I mean why the fuck
did I go to university

28:19.862 --> 28:21.128
all those years?

28:21.130 --> 28:22.331
Just to run the Taverna.

28:23.965 --> 28:25.798
You pushed me to go.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.735
Yeah, but what I'm
saying is for when

28:28.737 --> 28:30.571
you don't have a job,

28:30.573 --> 28:33.806
then the Taverna is going
to make up for your life.

28:33.808 --> 28:35.677
I can get a job easy Papa.

28:37.645 --> 28:38.812
The point is I'm just trying

28:38.814 --> 28:40.180
to find a good
company to work for,

28:40.182 --> 28:42.516
not like the last
bunch of malakas,

28:42.518 --> 28:44.252
they had no clue
wat they were doing.

28:45.554 --> 28:47.254
If you're worried
about the money,

28:47.256 --> 28:48.087
just take it back.

28:48.089 --> 28:49.055
No, I don't want it.

28:52.327 --> 28:55.663
We'll just simply
talk, all right?

28:57.566 --> 28:59.365
Where you go tonight?

28:59.367 --> 29:00.767
Just some drinks
with some friends.

29:00.769 --> 29:01.767
Okay.

29:01.769 --> 29:02.969
Have you eaten?

29:02.971 --> 29:03.903
You want me to
make you something

29:03.905 --> 29:04.872
to eat, souvlaki or something?

29:04.874 --> 29:07.207
No, I've already eaten.

29:07.209 --> 29:08.709
I gotta go anyway.

29:08.711 --> 29:09.709
All right.

29:09.711 --> 29:10.878
Thanks.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.379
Okay.

29:13.315 --> 29:14.717
Yeah, I love you.

29:22.156 --> 29:22.991
Kostas.

29:25.527 --> 29:28.094
Where's the belly
dancer tonight?

29:28.096 --> 29:29.595
The belly dancer.

29:29.597 --> 29:31.030
Of course.

29:31.032 --> 29:33.432
She will be here soon,
don't worry about it, okay.

29:33.434 --> 29:34.367
And in case it's me,

29:34.369 --> 29:35.369
you have me, okay.

29:35.371 --> 29:37.536
I'll do it, yeah.

29:37.538 --> 29:38.505
Okay, welcome.

29:38.507 --> 29:40.806
Rebecca, everything all right.

29:40.808 --> 29:43.410
Aw, Kostas, the food
was just beautiful.

29:43.412 --> 29:44.344
Bravo.

29:44.346 --> 29:45.278
Arman's looking forward

29:45.280 --> 29:46.546
to the belly dancer, of course.

29:46.548 --> 29:48.347
Ah, yeah, very much.

29:48.349 --> 29:51.084
You are going to dance, no?

29:51.086 --> 29:53.019
Yeah, if she's hot.

29:53.021 --> 29:54.287
Don't be a dick.

29:54.289 --> 29:58.057
He can be just a little
bit of a showoff.

29:58.059 --> 29:59.726
I'll tell you
what, I'll tell you.

29:59.728 --> 30:02.461
I used to do this job.

30:02.463 --> 30:04.498
I used to work
with a cruise ship

30:04.500 --> 30:05.865
and I was dancing,

30:05.867 --> 30:08.267
all the widows around,

30:08.269 --> 30:09.102
you know, they would sing,

30:09.104 --> 30:10.804
they were this and that.

30:10.806 --> 30:12.038
It was great fun.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.606
What, like a gigolo?

30:13.608 --> 30:14.841
Don't be scared.

30:14.843 --> 30:16.442
What gigolo?

30:16.444 --> 30:19.546
They were 100, 200
and 300 years old.

30:19.548 --> 30:21.414
No, no, I used to take them out,

30:21.416 --> 30:23.717
go to dinner with them, dance.

30:23.719 --> 30:25.719
When they were getting tired,

30:25.721 --> 30:27.254
I used to take them back,

30:27.256 --> 30:28.287
put them to sleep and that's it.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.655
Beautiful.

30:29.657 --> 30:30.657
Okay.

30:30.659 --> 30:31.959
Can I bring you something else?

30:31.961 --> 30:33.492
Oh, God, no.

30:33.494 --> 30:36.763
Actually maybe
just another wine.

30:36.765 --> 30:39.365
Beautiful, I bring.

30:39.367 --> 30:40.467
Enjoy.

30:40.469 --> 30:41.500
Okay.

30:41.502 --> 30:42.471
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.876
You need to stop
giving him money.

30:56.719 --> 30:58.818
Stop being a malaka.

30:58.820 --> 31:02.588
He needs to grow up
and become responsible.

31:02.590 --> 31:03.856
He's young.

31:10.566 --> 31:12.298
I lived with
him for two years.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.600
The only reason why
I kicked him out

31:13.602 --> 31:15.835
was to get him off drugs.

31:19.641 --> 31:21.310
And it's fucked.

31:22.478 --> 31:26.481
I thought he might love
me enough to go clean.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.683
But he doesn't love anyone.

31:30.685 --> 31:32.419
Or anything.

31:32.421 --> 31:33.989
Except ice.

31:36.125 --> 31:38.624
Kostas, you and Helen
need to face facts.

31:38.626 --> 31:41.995
You're enabling his addiction.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.639
Excuse me.

31:52.641 --> 31:53.840
Does anyone know

31:53.842 --> 31:55.241
when the belly
dancing's starting?

31:55.243 --> 31:57.045
No, sorry, I don't.

31:58.846 --> 31:59.681
Uh.

32:00.548 --> 32:01.847
She will be here soon, love.

32:01.849 --> 32:03.749
My husband's getting tired.

32:03.751 --> 32:04.918
Yes, sorry.

32:04.920 --> 32:08.057
She will be here
soon, all right, okay.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.026
Who is it?

32:13.028 --> 32:14.393
It's me darling.

32:14.395 --> 32:15.461
I'm not ready yet.

32:15.463 --> 32:17.264
How long?

32:17.266 --> 32:20.299
I don't know Kostas.

32:20.301 --> 32:23.304
Okay, five minutes?

32:30.612 --> 32:32.112
Ooh, ooh.

32:32.114 --> 32:35.148
You look beautiful.

32:35.150 --> 32:36.449
Really?

32:36.451 --> 32:37.683
Boys.

32:37.685 --> 32:39.553
Come here, come here.

32:39.555 --> 32:41.654
Doesn't she look sexy.

32:41.656 --> 32:43.323
You look hot.

32:43.325 --> 32:45.659
You are number one.

32:45.661 --> 32:47.227
Thanks guys.

32:47.229 --> 32:48.428
That's it.

32:48.430 --> 32:50.063
We go out there,

32:50.065 --> 32:51.998
everybody's waiting for you.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.432
No, I'm not ready yet.

32:53.434 --> 32:55.134
But you are ready.

32:55.136 --> 32:56.569
No, I mean the dancing.

32:56.571 --> 32:59.605
The dancing, come
on now, the dancing,

32:59.607 --> 33:01.408
you just zoon, zoon, zoon,
zoon, juggle a little bit,

33:01.410 --> 33:03.142
that's it, nobody will know.

33:03.144 --> 33:04.812
But I will Kostas.

33:06.248 --> 33:09.382
Would you serve crap food
in your restaurant, hmm?

33:09.384 --> 33:11.051
I don't think so.

33:11.053 --> 33:13.018
I have devoted my life

33:13.020 --> 33:16.590
to telling stories and
entertaining people.

33:16.592 --> 33:18.525
I am an actress.

33:18.527 --> 33:20.994
This is what I was born to do.

33:20.996 --> 33:23.095
Like you in your kitchen, yeah?

33:23.097 --> 33:24.463
Apparently.

33:24.465 --> 33:26.833
You are just going to
go out there and dance.

33:26.835 --> 33:29.268
You're not making the "Titanic."

33:29.270 --> 33:31.004
I don't care.

33:31.006 --> 33:33.840
I want everything
I do to be the best

33:33.842 --> 33:35.709
it possibly can be.

33:35.711 --> 33:37.276
But you're just
worried about getting

33:37.278 --> 33:40.380
me out there so that
people buy more alcohol.

33:40.382 --> 33:41.680
No.

33:41.682 --> 33:44.952
My work means more to
me than money Kostas.

34:13.548 --> 34:14.613
Excuse me.

34:14.615 --> 34:15.617
Hi.

34:16.518 --> 34:17.784
Hi.

34:17.786 --> 34:19.385
Hello.

34:19.387 --> 34:21.253
Do you have a booking?

34:21.255 --> 34:22.089
No.

34:24.659 --> 34:26.592
Do we need one?

34:26.594 --> 34:28.862
Yes, we're very busy.

34:28.864 --> 34:31.063
Well, well have
this table then.

34:33.068 --> 34:34.501
Okay, but you'll
have to be quick

34:34.503 --> 34:36.735
'cause the kitchen's
about to close.

34:36.737 --> 34:39.639
Ah, have we missed
the belly dancer?

34:39.641 --> 34:40.907
No.

34:40.909 --> 34:43.412
Do you boys want tap
or sparkling water?

34:44.445 --> 34:45.979
Tell you what, love.

34:45.981 --> 34:48.350
Bring us a couple
of beers, eh, go on.

34:49.518 --> 34:50.652
Sure.

34:54.556 --> 34:56.690
I've never cheated on anyone.

34:56.692 --> 35:01.429
So, like how does it
work Mr. Ladies Man?

35:03.632 --> 35:05.164
What do you mean?

35:05.166 --> 35:06.666
Well, for instance,

35:06.668 --> 35:09.436
while you were fucking me
and going home to wifey,

35:09.438 --> 35:10.403
how'd it work?

35:10.405 --> 35:12.238
Why are you drinking so much?

35:12.240 --> 35:14.407
Mm-mm, no, come on.

35:14.409 --> 35:16.278
Answer me, I'm
interested in this.

35:19.514 --> 35:22.882
Look at your scared
little eyes staring at me.

35:22.884 --> 35:25.653
Can I tell her the truth.

35:28.789 --> 35:30.356
I just wanna know
what to look for

35:30.358 --> 35:32.124
when it happens to me.

35:32.126 --> 35:33.392
It won't.

35:33.394 --> 35:35.628
How do I know that?

35:35.630 --> 35:38.632
Because I was never
really in love with her.

35:38.634 --> 35:40.833
But you must have
been at some stage,

35:40.835 --> 35:43.603
'cause you fucking
married her and had Ruby.

35:43.605 --> 35:45.037
Yeah, well, I thought I was.

35:45.039 --> 35:46.706
Well, you think
you're in love with me,

35:46.708 --> 35:49.342
so what's the difference?

35:49.344 --> 35:52.479
After the first
time I met you,

35:52.481 --> 35:54.914
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

35:54.916 --> 35:56.516
Now that we're together,

35:56.518 --> 35:59.019
I still can't stop
thinking bout you.

35:59.021 --> 36:01.789
That never happened with Jamila.

36:02.958 --> 36:04.724
After the first
time I fucked her,

36:04.726 --> 36:06.327
I never thought about her again.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.099
I'm just not in my body.

36:13.101 --> 36:14.566
You'll be fine.

36:14.568 --> 36:16.403
I can't go out there.

36:16.405 --> 36:17.436
Trust me.

36:17.438 --> 36:18.737
You'll be great.

36:18.739 --> 36:20.440
I can't believe I
agreed to do this.

36:20.442 --> 36:21.610
Don't be silly.

36:25.179 --> 36:28.548
You don't understand what
it's like to die on stage.

36:28.550 --> 36:31.117
Look, like you said to Kostas,

36:31.119 --> 36:32.985
you're an actress.

36:32.987 --> 36:36.123
So think of this
more like acting.

36:37.326 --> 36:39.559
Belly dancing is an
expressive art form,

36:39.561 --> 36:41.661
so just feel the music

36:41.663 --> 36:44.396
and let the moves come.

36:44.398 --> 36:46.166
Like improvisation?

36:46.168 --> 36:47.099
Yeah.

36:47.101 --> 36:48.967
I'm scared shitless of improv,

36:48.969 --> 36:50.705
I never know what to say next.

36:54.842 --> 36:57.010
If I can come up
with an objective,

36:57.012 --> 37:00.380
then let the music
take over my body,

37:00.382 --> 37:01.613
I think that can work.

37:01.615 --> 37:02.882
There you go.

37:02.884 --> 37:05.217
Okay, totally, so what
should be my objective?

37:05.219 --> 37:06.821
How about

37:11.159 --> 37:13.795
to make Arman's whore jealous.

37:17.965 --> 37:18.967
Oh, my God.

37:20.902 --> 37:22.369
That's it.

37:22.371 --> 37:23.202
Okay.

37:23.204 --> 37:24.470
Brilliant.

37:24.472 --> 37:26.039
Okay, cool, thank you so much.

37:26.041 --> 37:28.208
Okay, I'll let Kostas know.

37:28.210 --> 37:29.010
Okay.

37:31.947 --> 37:36.182
Hey, Frank, you won't
believe what I'm about-

37:36.184 --> 37:39.853
Oh, I can bring you home a souv.

37:39.855 --> 37:42.023
Didn't you have pizza
the other night?

37:43.190 --> 37:46.092
Oh, no, no, I was
just reminding you.

37:46.094 --> 37:47.327
Okay.

37:47.329 --> 37:49.331
Yeah, I'll order
it now on my phone.

38:01.777 --> 38:04.844
This is utterly
humiliating for me Omer.

38:04.846 --> 38:06.311
Don't worry about it Jamila.

38:06.313 --> 38:08.548
I don't have a friend
in the world right now.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.218
I'm your friend.

38:11.853 --> 38:13.188
Thank God.

38:14.755 --> 38:16.155
Can I ask you something

38:16.157 --> 38:18.425
and can you promise
to tell me the truth?

38:18.427 --> 38:20.025
Okay.

38:20.027 --> 38:21.494
Did you see his whore?

38:21.496 --> 38:22.564
Yeah.

38:24.766 --> 38:27.266
Do you think she's
hotter than me?

38:27.268 --> 38:28.834
No.

38:28.836 --> 38:29.670
No way.

38:31.338 --> 38:32.871
Really?

38:32.873 --> 38:33.707
Yeah.

38:38.313 --> 38:39.146
Okay.

38:42.451 --> 38:43.450
You know, I haven't
spoken to Arman

38:43.452 --> 38:45.552
since he left the house.

38:45.554 --> 38:46.820
Just through text messages

38:46.822 --> 38:49.354
or through the lawyer.

38:49.356 --> 38:51.624
If I could just
talk to him alone,

38:51.626 --> 38:53.959
I'm convinced I could
make him stop all this

38:53.961 --> 38:55.929
and just come home.

38:55.931 --> 38:58.063
Is that what you want?

38:58.065 --> 38:59.499
Yeah.

38:59.501 --> 39:00.936
More than anything.

39:13.380 --> 39:14.914
She is the type of woman

39:14.916 --> 39:17.050
that gets everything she wants.

39:17.052 --> 39:19.921
Yeah, and Arman is so stupid.

39:21.989 --> 39:24.523
You know I,

39:24.525 --> 39:26.694
I think about choking her.

39:28.896 --> 39:30.331
I know I shouldn't, but,

39:32.132 --> 39:35.002
I hate her so much.

39:36.271 --> 39:39.505
They said I was a danger
to Ruby at the hearing,

39:39.507 --> 39:41.106
but I would hurt Ruby.

39:41.108 --> 39:43.208
I had depression
after she was born,

39:43.210 --> 39:45.512
but it was Arman's mother
coming around all the time.

39:45.514 --> 39:47.282
She made me feel worse.

39:50.351 --> 39:51.818
I've got two assholes inside

39:51.820 --> 39:53.485
that just won't
order their food.

39:53.487 --> 39:55.621
And I've told them
the kitchen's closing.

39:55.623 --> 39:57.925
They think they just
fucking own the place.

40:00.896 --> 40:02.862
Ladies and gentlemen.

40:02.864 --> 40:04.764
Excuse me, thank you.

40:04.766 --> 40:06.432
Welcome again.

40:06.434 --> 40:08.767
I am very happy to tell you

40:08.769 --> 40:13.775
that she's finally here.

40:15.610 --> 40:16.443
Yes, yes.

40:17.811 --> 40:20.179
I know, I know, you've
been waiting for her,

40:20.181 --> 40:23.749
but you'll see
she's deserves it.

40:23.751 --> 40:26.920
She's all the way from
Los Angeles, California.

40:26.922 --> 40:29.456
The beautiful, the
belly dancer Diana.

40:30.858 --> 40:32.124
Here!

40:32.126 --> 40:33.458
Yes!

40:36.998 --> 40:38.133
Up, that's it.

40:46.106 --> 40:47.606
This fucking malaka.

40:47.608 --> 40:49.208
Can this muffin another beer?

40:49.210 --> 40:52.079
I swear to God I'm
gonna choke him.

41:10.699 --> 41:11.731
That's the waitress.

41:11.733 --> 41:13.199
It is, man.

41:13.201 --> 41:14.300
She's hot.

41:14.302 --> 41:16.570
I love that American chick.

43:42.916 --> 43:43.749
Fuck.

43:43.751 --> 43:44.684
Sorry, lady.

43:44.686 --> 43:46.052
You fucking scared me asshole.

43:46.054 --> 43:48.454
- Me?
- Yeah.

43:48.456 --> 43:49.289
Sorry.

43:52.159 --> 43:53.726
What do you want?

43:53.728 --> 43:55.595
Don't go back in there.

43:55.597 --> 43:56.595
What?

43:56.597 --> 43:57.563
Go home.

43:57.565 --> 43:58.664
I think you should go home

43:58.666 --> 43:59.499
is more appropriate.

43:59.501 --> 44:00.800
You know what lady?

44:00.802 --> 44:03.702
I think about that
every fucking day.

44:03.704 --> 44:05.037
Oh, fuck off.

44:05.039 --> 44:05.874
Oh!

44:06.775 --> 44:08.007
Mm!

44:08.009 --> 44:09.407
Mm!

44:51.652 --> 44:52.584
You all right darling?

44:52.586 --> 44:53.619
Oh, yeah.

44:53.621 --> 44:55.253
Yes, okay, are you hurt?

44:55.255 --> 44:57.990
No, I just bruised
my knee a little bit.

44:57.992 --> 44:59.425
Okay, you are beautiful.

44:59.427 --> 45:00.827
I'll bring you some
ice for it, all right.

45:00.829 --> 45:01.827
Thank you.

45:01.829 --> 45:04.097
- Okay darling.
- Thank you.

45:12.239 --> 45:14.974
Sorry about
the drama tonight folks.

45:14.976 --> 45:16.242
It's fine.

45:16.244 --> 45:18.311
It was worth waiting for.

45:18.313 --> 45:21.880
It was fantastic,
more than we expected.

45:21.882 --> 45:23.148
There you go guys.

45:23.150 --> 45:26.818
Here's your receipt,
thank you very much.

45:26.820 --> 45:27.621
Okay.

45:37.164 --> 45:38.063
Where were you?

45:38.065 --> 45:39.197
I had some work.

45:39.199 --> 45:40.599
There was a big fight.

45:40.601 --> 45:41.934
What?

45:41.936 --> 45:42.737
Yeah.

45:47.574 --> 45:48.541
Where were you?

45:48.543 --> 45:50.075
It was like Ling Cafe in here?

45:50.077 --> 45:51.543
I was checking the possum.

45:51.545 --> 45:53.412
Couldn't you hear the yelling?

45:53.414 --> 45:56.148
I had bad hearing.

45:56.150 --> 45:57.717
What happened to you?

45:57.719 --> 46:00.452
The old guy with the
glasses tried to rape me.

46:00.454 --> 46:01.387
What?

46:01.389 --> 46:02.188
He didn't try and rape you,

46:02.190 --> 46:03.588
he touched your ass.

46:03.590 --> 46:04.523
The guy's a fucking creep.

46:04.525 --> 46:06.391
There was penetration, okay.

46:06.393 --> 46:07.894
I didn't ask for it,

46:07.896 --> 46:09.695
I was just out there
trying to do my job.

46:09.697 --> 46:10.795
Aw, come off it.

46:10.797 --> 46:12.465
What?

46:12.467 --> 46:15.333
You were practically
gyrating Jamila's ex

46:15.335 --> 46:16.568
just before it.

46:16.570 --> 46:19.473
No, no, that was
part of the act.

46:20.574 --> 46:24.744
Katerina, his finger
went up there.

46:24.746 --> 46:26.845
She gets excited, you know,

46:26.847 --> 46:27.914
but she's a very good kid.

46:27.916 --> 46:30.316
Sorry about the trouble boys.

46:30.318 --> 46:31.583
Okay?

46:31.585 --> 46:34.387
Whatever you have
taken it's on Kostas

46:34.389 --> 46:37.722
and you come in again,
you see Zabella,

46:37.724 --> 46:38.557
the belly dancer.

46:38.559 --> 46:39.492
Hang about?

46:39.494 --> 46:40.662
We haven't eaten anything.

46:42.963 --> 46:45.130
You've ordered.

46:45.132 --> 46:47.365
How the fuck can I order

46:47.367 --> 46:49.903
when your belly
dancer kin hits me?

46:51.072 --> 46:52.637
I'll be back.

46:52.639 --> 46:53.738
Are you sure you're okay.

46:53.740 --> 46:55.173
It was
bullshit, yeah, so what.

46:55.175 --> 46:56.309
Is she American bro?

46:56.311 --> 46:57.476
Who?

46:57.478 --> 46:58.646
The belly dancer.

47:00.081 --> 47:02.481
Actually I think she's Kiwi.

47:02.483 --> 47:04.383
Have a good night.

47:04.385 --> 47:07.753
Hey, belly
dancer's coming over.

47:07.755 --> 47:12.760
Yeah, just let me
talk to her alone.

47:15.862 --> 47:18.063
Oh boys.

47:18.065 --> 47:20.199
Hey, watch out for the
belly dancer, yeah.

47:20.201 --> 47:22.536
She's got a vicious right hook.

47:26.807 --> 47:28.139
Hey.

47:28.141 --> 47:29.976
My hero.

47:29.978 --> 47:31.776
Thank you so much.

47:31.778 --> 47:32.612
That's okay.

47:35.215 --> 47:36.683
What you did for me,

47:38.385 --> 47:41.154
I mean you probably
don't realize this,

47:42.889 --> 47:44.155
but you honored me.

47:44.157 --> 47:46.291
All right, it's
okay, no problem.

47:46.293 --> 47:49.096
Thank you, thank you.

47:51.465 --> 47:52.731
Kitchen is closed.

47:52.733 --> 47:56.668
You won't want to read
by Trip Advisor review.

47:56.670 --> 48:01.374
He has 478 followers.

48:01.376 --> 48:02.443
Local.

48:04.177 --> 48:06.778
My kids read about
these things, you know.

48:06.780 --> 48:09.648
We came
here for souvlaki.

48:09.650 --> 48:12.751
Okay, and the
kitchen is closed.

48:12.753 --> 48:13.753
My friends.

48:22.764 --> 48:26.331
Are you saying
something about us?

48:26.333 --> 48:28.867
No, we're talking about food.

48:28.869 --> 48:30.702
Well, what about some food.

48:30.704 --> 48:33.139
The kitchen is closed.

48:33.141 --> 48:36.409
I'll close the whole place.

48:36.411 --> 48:38.443
All right, okay.

48:38.445 --> 48:40.912
We'll do something
about it, okay.

48:40.914 --> 48:43.650
I'll see what I can
do for you, all right?

48:44.552 --> 48:46.485
What a night tonight.

48:46.487 --> 48:48.119
You want me to throw them out?

48:48.121 --> 48:49.889
No, no, no.

48:49.891 --> 48:51.322
Any gyros left?

48:51.324 --> 48:52.992
No.

48:52.994 --> 48:54.293
Okay, catasouli?

48:54.295 --> 48:55.360
No.

48:55.362 --> 48:56.162
Calamari?

48:56.164 --> 48:57.262
What do they want?

48:57.264 --> 48:58.963
Souvlaki.

48:58.965 --> 49:00.500
I'll find something.

49:02.637 --> 49:05.470
Cats, dogs, it's doesn't
matter, it's malakas.

49:05.472 --> 49:07.741
Goodnight, goodnight.

49:09.443 --> 49:10.943
Go to him.

49:10.945 --> 49:12.144
She'll see me.

49:12.146 --> 49:13.579
She won't.

49:13.581 --> 49:15.481
They have a restraining order.

49:15.483 --> 49:17.450
You don't have to
worry about that.

49:17.452 --> 49:18.450
Yes, I do Omer.

49:18.452 --> 49:20.552
That lawyer told
me if I breached

49:20.554 --> 49:22.188
that order again,
I'm going to jail

49:22.190 --> 49:24.757
and that won't
look good in court.

49:24.759 --> 49:25.791
She go in a taxi.

49:25.793 --> 49:28.094
She was very angry.

49:28.096 --> 49:29.762
Are you sure?

49:29.764 --> 49:30.664
Yeah.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.102
Hey, Jamila.

49:35.302 --> 49:36.568
Oh, my God.

49:36.570 --> 49:37.970
Amazing.

49:37.972 --> 49:39.472
Thank you so much.

49:39.474 --> 49:41.340
Oh, I got you some tips.

49:41.342 --> 49:42.974
You know, before I got attacked.

49:42.976 --> 49:44.642
Oh, thanks.

49:44.644 --> 49:46.412
I'm so glad you
punched that guy out.

49:46.414 --> 49:48.347
Yeah, what a fucking pig.

49:48.349 --> 49:49.280
Yeah.

49:49.282 --> 49:50.950
Your dancing was so good,

49:50.952 --> 49:52.784
it caused a brawl.

49:52.786 --> 49:56.822
Yeah, well, did
you see her leave?

49:56.824 --> 49:57.655
I did.

49:57.657 --> 49:58.557
How good was that?

49:58.559 --> 49:59.691
I know.

49:59.693 --> 50:01.427
You know she
hasn't come back yet.

50:01.429 --> 50:03.429
Yeah, he's sitting
out there all alone.

50:03.431 --> 50:05.264
I know.

50:05.266 --> 50:07.633
Ah, hey, I'm really sorry.

50:07.635 --> 50:09.470
Your skirt got ripped.

50:27.188 --> 50:28.354
Kostas.

50:28.356 --> 50:30.155
Uh, where are the toilets?

50:30.157 --> 50:31.389
Through there.

50:31.391 --> 50:32.458
It's locked.

50:32.460 --> 50:33.594
It's locked.

50:34.996 --> 50:35.963
It's locked.

50:37.264 --> 50:38.796
Let's see.

50:38.798 --> 50:40.833
That's funny.

50:40.835 --> 50:42.066
It is.

50:42.068 --> 50:44.170
Somebody has locked
it from outside.

50:44.172 --> 50:46.438
I go, okay, open, okay.

50:46.440 --> 50:48.072
Omer of making souvlaki.

51:02.155 --> 51:03.824
Fuck, that's diversion.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.094
Here you go.

51:09.096 --> 51:10.229
Excuse me?

51:10.231 --> 51:12.865
Oh, it's like
bruschettas, only Greek.

51:12.867 --> 51:17.403
See you got your tzatziki,
your eggplant, your caviar.

51:17.405 --> 51:19.070
Some bread.

51:19.072 --> 51:21.139
That looks all right.

51:21.141 --> 51:22.541
You are gonna
feature as the glue

51:22.543 --> 51:24.876
in my review of this place.

51:24.878 --> 51:26.279
That's nice.

51:31.918 --> 51:33.052
Okay.

51:33.054 --> 51:34.188
Okay.

51:35.322 --> 51:36.755
What happened?

51:36.757 --> 51:39.458
Did you have a
fight with Rebecca?

51:39.460 --> 51:41.760
My wife and I would
have a fight every day.

51:41.762 --> 51:43.394
We love each other.

51:43.396 --> 51:45.197
Look, I was just dancing
with the belly dancer

51:45.199 --> 51:46.867
and then she went to the toilet.

51:49.469 --> 51:50.903
You want to go to the toilet?

51:50.905 --> 51:51.737
Yeah.

51:51.739 --> 51:52.673
Okay, go.

52:02.349 --> 52:03.183
Rebecca?

52:07.521 --> 52:08.623
Rebecca?

52:15.096 --> 52:16.095
Oh.

52:16.097 --> 52:17.362
Nobody's here.

52:17.364 --> 52:19.365
Are you sure she
went to the toilet?

52:19.367 --> 52:20.298
Yeah, I think so.

52:20.300 --> 52:22.001
What, is there another way out?

52:22.003 --> 52:23.369
Yes, there is, of course,

52:23.371 --> 52:24.903
the courtyard here,

52:24.905 --> 52:26.804
where the staff goes to smoke

52:26.806 --> 52:28.307
and then there is the lane,

52:28.309 --> 52:29.508
you want me to show you?

52:29.510 --> 52:31.043
No, that's all
right, I need to go.

52:31.045 --> 52:32.244
Okay, don't worry about it.

52:32.246 --> 52:34.479
My boy, don't worry
about it, okay.

52:34.481 --> 52:35.780
These things happen.

52:35.782 --> 52:37.749
She's a lovely
girl, but she wants

52:37.751 --> 52:39.418
to be boss like her father.

52:39.420 --> 52:43.054
If she wants to be
boss, let her be boss.

52:43.056 --> 52:45.657
♪ Rebecca ♪

53:09.550 --> 53:10.983
Rebecca.

53:10.985 --> 53:11.916
Where are you?

53:11.918 --> 53:13.719
Have you gone home?

53:13.721 --> 53:16.155
Baby, I'm worried about you.

53:16.157 --> 53:18.157
Look, I'm sorry if I upset you,

53:18.159 --> 53:19.391
I didn't mean to.

53:19.393 --> 53:21.959
I was just, um, I
was just having fun.

53:21.961 --> 53:22.827
You said you like
to watch me dance,

53:22.829 --> 53:24.463
I was dancing for you.

53:24.465 --> 53:27.835
Can you please call me back
when you get this message.

53:41.282 --> 53:42.280
Hey.

53:42.282 --> 53:43.715
I'm so glad that you called.

53:43.717 --> 53:46.219
You're never gonna believe
what happened Frank.

53:48.289 --> 53:50.755
Oh, shit.

53:50.757 --> 53:53.358
I completely forgot.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.427
Fuck, babe, I'm so sorry.

53:55.429 --> 53:57.498
I'll do it now, I'll
call you back, okay, bye.

54:22.322 --> 54:26.092
Hey, uh, Lexie
Baker's is closed.

54:27.628 --> 54:29.797
Yeah, they're closed, too.

54:31.132 --> 54:32.500
I'm still at work.

54:35.135 --> 54:37.404
Well, I can bring
you home a souv.

54:39.706 --> 54:42.007
Or you could get off
your fat fucking ass

54:42.009 --> 54:43.777
and do it yourself.

54:46.079 --> 54:47.311
Oh, no.

54:47.313 --> 54:48.246
What?

54:48.248 --> 54:49.148
Is that what I think it is?

54:49.150 --> 54:50.249
What it is?

54:50.251 --> 54:51.617
Fuck, it's possum.

54:51.619 --> 54:52.686
Oh, shit.

54:53.954 --> 54:55.420
What are you gonna do with it?

54:55.422 --> 54:57.923
Ah, he's making souvlaki
for the food critics.

54:57.925 --> 54:59.157
Can you eat it?

54:59.159 --> 55:00.659
They eat it on the
"Beverly Hillbillies."

55:00.661 --> 55:01.492
What?

55:01.494 --> 55:03.431
It's a TV show malaka.

55:05.132 --> 55:07.699
Oh, look, I found
some recipes here.

55:07.701 --> 55:09.735
You can't eat it Omer.

55:09.737 --> 55:10.570
Why not?

55:13.239 --> 55:15.273
Come on Samir, make me coffee.

55:15.275 --> 55:16.911
Come on, move, move.

55:18.077 --> 55:20.045
What is this?

55:20.047 --> 55:21.981
For those mother fuckers.

55:23.617 --> 55:24.550
What did you find?

55:24.552 --> 55:25.553
Don't ask.

55:27.221 --> 55:28.954
What is this?

55:28.956 --> 55:29.822
Possum.

55:29.824 --> 55:30.956
Possum?

55:30.958 --> 55:31.791
Yes.

55:32.827 --> 55:33.958
You got it.

55:33.960 --> 55:34.892
Yes.

55:34.894 --> 55:36.829
You can eat it apparently.

55:36.831 --> 55:38.432
They say it tastes like chicken.

55:52.612 --> 55:55.347
I haven't smoked for
the last seven years.

55:55.349 --> 55:56.782
I want a cigarette.

55:56.784 --> 55:57.615
You want one?

55:57.617 --> 55:58.585
- Now!
- Okay.

56:04.557 --> 56:05.659
All right.

56:07.695 --> 56:09.695
In this shop,

56:09.697 --> 56:14.702
for the last 25 years, we
only serve the best meat.

56:15.635 --> 56:17.070
It's like rabbit Kostas.

56:24.844 --> 56:25.678
Oregano.

56:27.014 --> 56:30.315
Put garlic.

56:30.317 --> 56:31.115
Salt.

56:31.117 --> 56:32.351
Pepper.

56:32.353 --> 56:34.219
and lemon.

56:34.221 --> 56:35.153
Okay, fuck it.

56:35.155 --> 56:36.354
Leave it with me.

56:36.356 --> 56:37.188
Now.

56:37.190 --> 56:38.657
That's it.

56:38.659 --> 56:40.592
Hey, what's everyone doing?

56:40.594 --> 56:41.526
Nothing.

56:45.932 --> 56:47.032
Kostas gonna have a smoke.

56:47.034 --> 56:48.266
Really?

56:48.268 --> 56:50.903
If everything goes to
shit tonight darling.

56:50.905 --> 56:53.340
Oh.

56:56.744 --> 56:59.610
Oh, my God, take a look.

56:59.612 --> 57:01.781
Yay, Jamila, go for it.

57:06.119 --> 57:08.621
Oh, fuck, this
could be round two.

57:10.224 --> 57:11.456
Kosta.

57:11.458 --> 57:13.358
Are you gonna smoke
that thing or fuck it?

57:13.360 --> 57:14.659
I'm sticking around for this.

57:14.661 --> 57:16.128
Don't worry Kostas,
it's on my own time.

57:16.130 --> 57:18.599
Okay, okay, bravo, bravo.

57:27.173 --> 57:29.240
I don't know why you
don't answer your phone,

57:29.242 --> 57:31.075
but this is ridiculous Rebecca.

57:31.077 --> 57:32.679
I love you.

57:33.813 --> 57:36.581
You know I don't
have my wallet on me

57:36.583 --> 57:37.950
because you said that I look

57:37.952 --> 57:40.351
like a Pakistani with
a bomb in my pocket.

57:40.353 --> 57:42.855
Please, call me back.

57:50.731 --> 57:52.466
Now you can stop
telling me off.

58:29.702 --> 58:31.103
Hello.

58:31.105 --> 58:32.070
What happened?

58:32.072 --> 58:34.472
Did you find Rebecca?

58:34.474 --> 58:37.141
No, uh, she's, uh,
not answering her phone,

58:37.143 --> 58:39.077
so I just thought
I'd come out here,

58:39.079 --> 58:43.280
see if she's here, but,
uh, yeah, she's not.

58:43.282 --> 58:46.653
No, no, here,
Rebecca not here.

58:48.389 --> 58:50.921
I'll just head back inside.

58:50.923 --> 58:51.925
Finish off my drink.

58:52.760 --> 58:53.594
Good idea.

59:03.336 --> 59:05.304
I reckon he was
gonna do a runner?

59:06.306 --> 59:07.240
That one?

59:08.208 --> 59:09.574
You think so?

59:09.576 --> 59:11.208
Yes.

59:11.210 --> 59:12.943
Didn't you see him?

59:12.945 --> 59:14.512
He looked very guilty.

59:14.514 --> 59:15.648
He was all nervous.

59:33.467 --> 59:35.367
Hello, Katerina, how are you?

59:35.369 --> 59:37.501
Hi, Helen, I'm well thanks.

59:37.503 --> 59:38.970
That's good love.

59:44.010 --> 59:46.045
I should be going back inside.

59:50.951 --> 59:54.052
Angelo's had an accident.

59:55.755 --> 59:57.722
He's okay Kostas,
he's home now.

1:00:02.061 --> 1:00:03.961
That wasn't his fault.

1:00:03.963 --> 1:00:05.664
He didn't see it.

1:00:05.666 --> 1:00:09.269
He hit a motorbike, one of
those Domino Pizza scooters.

1:00:10.336 --> 1:00:13.273
The poor thing panicked
and didn't stop.

1:00:14.474 --> 1:00:16.407
It was the shock.

1:00:16.409 --> 1:00:18.008
He wasn't thinking properly.

1:00:21.181 --> 1:00:22.880
You can't see those
bloody scooters

1:00:22.882 --> 1:00:23.914
at the best of times.

1:00:23.916 --> 1:00:25.985
They shouldn't be legal.

1:00:29.722 --> 1:00:30.956
He was at the Royal Melbourne.

1:00:30.958 --> 1:00:32.923
They couldn't tell
me how he was.

1:00:32.925 --> 1:00:37.329
I pretended I was one of
the managers at Domino's.

1:00:40.768 --> 1:00:43.735
I think he was scared because
the police would come.

1:00:51.778 --> 1:00:54.211
He's had terrible luck
in his life Kostas.

1:00:57.351 --> 1:01:00.485
He's worried about the police

1:01:00.487 --> 1:01:02.420
getting his number
plate from the cameras

1:01:02.422 --> 1:01:04.423
and tracing it to the Taverna.

1:01:24.177 --> 1:01:25.376
What are you doing?

1:01:25.378 --> 1:01:26.246
Sit down Arman.

1:01:27.347 --> 1:01:29.283
We need to talk.

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:35.186
What are you doing here?

1:01:35.188 --> 1:01:37.655
You know there's an
intervention order.

1:01:37.657 --> 1:01:38.889
I work here.

1:01:38.891 --> 1:01:41.059
Are you going to report me?

1:01:41.061 --> 1:01:42.260
No.

1:01:42.262 --> 1:01:44.498
But if Rebecca
sees you, she will.

1:01:45.731 --> 1:01:47.833
You're a coward.

1:01:47.835 --> 1:01:50.467
You couldn't even
tell me to my face.

1:01:50.469 --> 1:01:52.304
And what about Ruby?

1:01:52.306 --> 1:01:54.338
Your own flesh and blood.

1:01:54.340 --> 1:01:57.176
You walk out on us
as if we were shit.

1:01:59.012 --> 1:02:00.480
Look at her.

1:02:02.516 --> 1:02:06.052
See how much she's grown
in just two months.

1:02:07.653 --> 1:02:09.621
You can't face the facts that

1:02:09.623 --> 1:02:12.389
you've completely fucked over me

1:02:12.391 --> 1:02:15.962
and Ruby for a dirty old slut.

1:02:17.396 --> 1:02:18.729
She's not that.

1:02:18.731 --> 1:02:21.400
Yes, she is, don't defend her.

1:02:23.003 --> 1:02:24.271
Ruby hates you.

1:02:25.706 --> 1:02:27.204
Do you know that?

1:02:27.206 --> 1:02:29.574
I had everything
planned for you,

1:02:29.576 --> 1:02:31.141
but you ruined it.

1:02:31.143 --> 1:02:34.845
Sending her text messages,
slashing her tires,

1:02:34.847 --> 1:02:38.083
emailing her work,
harassing her,

1:02:38.085 --> 1:02:41.186
doing crazy things.

1:02:41.188 --> 1:02:43.755
She's from an important family.

1:02:43.757 --> 1:02:45.456
Okay, you run off and
expect me to be nice about it.

1:02:45.458 --> 1:02:49.494
I was gonna take care of
you and Ruby with money,

1:02:49.496 --> 1:02:51.795
set you up for the
rest of your life

1:02:51.797 --> 1:02:53.898
so you wouldn't have to
worry about finances.

1:02:53.900 --> 1:02:55.167
I don't want their money.

1:02:57.036 --> 1:02:58.802
Come home Arman.

1:02:58.804 --> 1:03:00.405
When you become an engineer,

1:03:00.407 --> 1:03:02.641
we'll have all
the money we need.

1:03:02.643 --> 1:03:04.211
It's not too late.

1:03:05.112 --> 1:03:07.177
I still love you.

1:03:07.179 --> 1:03:09.215
You know you love me, too.

1:03:10.784 --> 1:03:12.019
I have Rebecca now.

1:03:13.686 --> 1:03:15.389
Did you see the
text I sent you?

1:03:16.322 --> 1:03:17.789
Yeah.

1:03:17.791 --> 1:03:20.958
You can have me and
that dancer, for instance,

1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:23.061
whenever you want.

1:03:23.063 --> 1:03:25.798
She told me she wants
to fuck us both.

1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:30.534
When are you
going to face facts?

1:03:30.536 --> 1:03:33.405
I don't love you anymore.

1:03:33.407 --> 1:03:36.109
I think you're sick.

1:03:39.278 --> 1:03:41.079
You won't get Ruby.

1:03:41.081 --> 1:03:43.014
Honestly, I'd prefer
her to stay with you,

1:03:43.016 --> 1:03:44.349
but Rebecca wants her now.

1:03:44.351 --> 1:03:46.318
She won't get her.

1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:48.686
Hey, that smells amazing Omer.

1:03:48.688 --> 1:03:50.790
I put extra garlic.

1:03:52.192 --> 1:03:53.427
Do you miss Ang?

1:03:54.628 --> 1:03:55.495
Yeah.

1:03:56.463 --> 1:03:57.662
Who am I kidding.

1:03:57.664 --> 1:03:58.630
I love him.

1:03:58.632 --> 1:04:00.565
I think about him every day,

1:04:00.567 --> 1:04:02.534
even though he's a shit.

1:04:02.536 --> 1:04:04.836
Hey, sometimes
you've just gotta face

1:04:04.838 --> 1:04:07.371
the facts and accept
people for who they are.

1:04:07.373 --> 1:04:09.974
I saw Helen before.

1:04:09.976 --> 1:04:13.979
I think she blames me for
Ang being on the ghee.

1:04:13.981 --> 1:04:15.780
No way.

1:04:15.782 --> 1:04:18.816
No, she's probably
just angry at herself.

1:04:18.818 --> 1:04:20.253
How's Frank?

1:04:22.356 --> 1:04:24.856
We just had this huge fight.

1:04:24.858 --> 1:04:27.224
Oh, what happened?

1:04:27.226 --> 1:04:28.760
I forgot to order his pizza

1:04:28.762 --> 1:04:30.330
and then I yelled at him.

1:04:35.601 --> 1:04:38.036
I'm an idiot, aren't I.

1:04:38.038 --> 1:04:41.206
Seriously, I've gotta
stop doing this.

1:04:41.208 --> 1:04:45.309
You know, I felt violated
with that guy, I still do.

1:04:45.311 --> 1:04:50.317
But, and this is gonna sound
completely inappropriate.

1:04:52.585 --> 1:04:56.588
At least he made me feel
wanted and appreciated.

1:04:56.590 --> 1:04:58.757
All for the wrong
reasons, I know,

1:04:58.759 --> 1:05:03.260
but at least I got
some attention.

1:05:03.262 --> 1:05:04.929
I get it babe.

1:05:04.931 --> 1:05:09.166
Listen, you need to stop
ordering pizzas for Frank.

1:05:09.168 --> 1:05:11.202
He gets stressed out
doing stuff for himself.

1:05:11.204 --> 1:05:13.371
He's a grown man,
he'll sort it out.

1:05:13.373 --> 1:05:15.807
Make him appreciate you more.

1:05:15.809 --> 1:05:18.742
I know, but here's
the thing, right.

1:05:18.744 --> 1:05:20.177
For the last half an hour,

1:05:20.179 --> 1:05:22.447
all I can think about
is taking home a souv.

1:05:22.449 --> 1:05:24.648
'Cause like that's
how my brain works,

1:05:24.650 --> 1:05:25.583
he makes me feel guilty

1:05:25.585 --> 1:05:27.385
and then I do things for him.

1:05:27.387 --> 1:05:30.121
Sally, seriously,
I do not recommend

1:05:30.123 --> 1:05:32.826
that you take home the
souv for Frank tonight.

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:36.927
Okay, thanks Kat.

1:05:36.929 --> 1:05:38.831
Yeah, you're right.

1:05:40.634 --> 1:05:42.367
You're the best.

1:05:52.478 --> 1:05:55.947
Here you go guys,
sorry about the wait.

1:05:55.949 --> 1:05:56.947
The glue.

1:05:56.949 --> 1:05:57.783
Yes.

1:06:22.541 --> 1:06:25.311
Can I get you lovebirds
anything else?

1:06:27.146 --> 1:06:28.146
You?

1:06:28.148 --> 1:06:29.746
You want another drink?

1:06:29.748 --> 1:06:31.316
No.

1:06:31.318 --> 1:06:34.354
Okay, I'll just
grab your bill then.

1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:41.226
Jamila.

1:06:41.228 --> 1:06:45.597
Um, can I borrow some money?

1:06:45.599 --> 1:06:47.067
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

1:06:48.969 --> 1:06:50.436
I don't have any.

1:06:51.570 --> 1:06:53.438
Doesn't she give you money?

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:55.639
I don't know where
she is right now.

1:06:55.641 --> 1:06:57.307
Be careful old man.

1:06:57.309 --> 1:06:59.344
These people are not like us.

1:06:59.346 --> 1:07:00.278
Like you.

1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:03.180
I know what I'm doing.

1:07:03.182 --> 1:07:04.384
Do you?

1:07:05.585 --> 1:07:09.287
You see that jacket on
the back of your chair?

1:07:09.289 --> 1:07:10.123
Feel it.

1:07:12.159 --> 1:07:15.427
That is Vicuna wool.

1:07:16.762 --> 1:07:18.695
It's from the most expensive
sheep in the world.

1:07:18.697 --> 1:07:20.699
I never even heard about ti.

1:07:21.735 --> 1:07:24.034
How much do you think that cost?

1:07:55.568 --> 1:07:57.802
Have you been drinking?

1:07:57.804 --> 1:07:59.903
Because it's not worth this.

1:07:59.905 --> 1:08:01.072
Are you sure?

1:08:01.074 --> 1:08:03.173
Are you sure?

1:08:03.175 --> 1:08:04.474
Nah.

1:08:04.476 --> 1:08:07.311
Don't drink anymore
Kostas, please.

1:08:07.313 --> 1:08:08.512
Okay?

1:08:08.514 --> 1:08:12.916
I'll call Zeus Goldman
if I get arrested.

1:08:18.123 --> 1:08:21.159
That's what I was
waiting for, I was.

1:08:21.161 --> 1:08:22.162
Uh, bravo.

1:09:18.051 --> 1:09:19.049
Oy!

1:09:19.051 --> 1:09:21.052
Two more beers, yeah.

1:09:21.054 --> 1:09:21.887
Two more.

1:09:28.427 --> 1:09:29.861
Bar is closed.

1:09:29.863 --> 1:09:31.998
You keep closing things.

1:09:33.632 --> 1:09:35.001
Sorry, boys.

1:09:36.136 --> 1:09:38.102
No more.

1:09:38.104 --> 1:09:40.204
Go to the pub.

1:09:40.206 --> 1:09:42.373
That's not fair, mate.

1:09:42.375 --> 1:09:43.708
That's unfair?

1:09:43.710 --> 1:09:44.743
Yeah.

1:09:46.279 --> 1:09:47.577
That's not fair?

1:09:47.579 --> 1:09:49.479
And it is fair for
you to sit here

1:09:49.481 --> 1:09:51.281
and drink and eat for free.

1:09:51.283 --> 1:09:52.282
That's fair?

1:09:52.284 --> 1:09:53.684
Yeah, it's fair.

1:09:53.686 --> 1:09:55.419
That review.

1:09:55.421 --> 1:09:57.120
Post it.

1:09:57.122 --> 1:09:58.923
Post it.

1:09:58.925 --> 1:10:01.793
I'm gonna close
your shop down.

1:10:04.564 --> 1:10:07.799
Get the fuck out
of my restaurant.

1:10:07.801 --> 1:10:08.799
Now.

1:10:09.636 --> 1:10:10.768
Out!

1:10:10.770 --> 1:10:12.305
Get the fuck out.

1:10:16.208 --> 1:10:17.143
Oy!

1:10:18.310 --> 1:10:21.312
No need to be so fucking rude.

1:10:21.314 --> 1:10:22.479
Out!

1:10:22.481 --> 1:10:23.315
Exo!

1:10:25.685 --> 1:10:26.519
Exo!

1:10:42.969 --> 1:10:44.736
Kostas, can I get paid?

1:10:44.738 --> 1:10:46.036
I have to go home
because the babysitter's

1:10:46.038 --> 1:10:47.638
about to leave soon.

1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:49.374
Yes, of course, of course.

1:10:49.376 --> 1:10:52.509
Sorry about the
shouting darling.

1:10:52.511 --> 1:10:54.845
Okay, did you get your tips?

1:10:54.847 --> 1:10:56.748
Yeah, Sally gave
me what she earned.

1:10:56.750 --> 1:10:58.281
Okay, okay.

1:10:58.283 --> 1:11:01.218
Did you get a chance
to talk to him darling?

1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:02.087
Yeah.

1:11:03.355 --> 1:11:05.857
It's definitely over between us.

1:11:05.859 --> 1:11:07.191
Okay.

1:11:07.193 --> 1:11:10.628
Time for you to
fall in love again.

1:11:10.630 --> 1:11:12.330
You are young and beautiful.

1:11:12.332 --> 1:11:13.964
There are a lot of men

1:11:13.966 --> 1:11:15.967
out there for you Jamila.

1:11:15.969 --> 1:11:16.800
Yes?

1:11:16.802 --> 1:11:18.602
Here.

1:11:18.604 --> 1:11:20.504
Thanks Kostas.

1:11:20.506 --> 1:11:21.340
Here.

1:11:25.145 --> 1:11:26.212
Well.

1:11:27.113 --> 1:11:28.345
He can't pay the bill

1:11:28.347 --> 1:11:29.781
because he left
his wallet at home

1:11:29.783 --> 1:11:32.517
and that slut, I mean Rebecca,

1:11:32.519 --> 1:11:33.851
she was supposed to pay,

1:11:33.853 --> 1:11:35.253
but she's still missing.

1:11:35.255 --> 1:11:38.688
Rebecca hasn't come back yet?

1:11:38.690 --> 1:11:40.492
Where did she go?

1:11:43.496 --> 1:11:46.830
Maybe I have to
speak to her father.

1:11:46.832 --> 1:11:48.600
Well, he's embarrassed.

1:11:50.636 --> 1:11:53.704
Okay, go tell him the
bill is done, all right.

1:11:53.706 --> 1:11:54.504
No problem.

1:11:54.506 --> 1:11:55.705
Not to worry.

1:11:55.707 --> 1:11:57.674
We're not gonna say
anything to him.

1:11:57.676 --> 1:12:01.344
I already told Arman what
a lovely girl he had,

1:12:01.346 --> 1:12:02.948
what a lovely girl.

1:12:28.073 --> 1:12:29.272
What does that mean?

1:12:29.274 --> 1:12:33.910
Mean a true friend
tells the bitter truth.

1:12:33.912 --> 1:12:34.746
Okay.

1:12:36.515 --> 1:12:37.850
So bring it on.

1:12:46.024 --> 1:12:47.559
Your dancing is no good.

1:12:51.764 --> 1:12:52.565
Okay.

1:12:53.867 --> 1:12:54.734
Geez.

1:12:55.902 --> 1:12:57.134
You know, maybe if
you had of said that

1:12:57.136 --> 1:13:01.539
to me yesterday, I'd
have been crushed.

1:13:01.541 --> 1:13:03.273
But I'm an actress,

1:13:03.275 --> 1:13:04.875
not a dancer.

1:13:04.877 --> 1:13:08.745
So thank you for
your honestly Omer.

1:13:08.747 --> 1:13:10.549
Okay, now it's my turn.

1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:16.122
Okay.

1:13:18.457 --> 1:13:19.523
You have to get over

1:13:19.525 --> 1:13:21.126
the death of your wife and kids.

1:13:45.451 --> 1:13:46.951
Can I take you home?

1:13:46.953 --> 1:13:49.188
It's the least I can do.

1:13:53.158 --> 1:13:56.527
This is Ismelt,
this was Singue.

1:13:58.730 --> 1:13:59.996
What was that?

1:14:01.967 --> 1:14:03.034
Huh?

1:14:03.036 --> 1:14:05.702
Another one, another one.

1:14:05.704 --> 1:14:09.072
You say to the police
Kostas left the restaurant

1:14:09.074 --> 1:14:11.842
and went home because
Helen was sick.

1:14:11.844 --> 1:14:13.445
Don't do it Kostas.

1:14:14.814 --> 1:14:16.179
And if I go to jail,

1:14:16.181 --> 1:14:19.250
you are going to
tell the customers

1:14:19.252 --> 1:14:21.419
that Kostas has gone to Greece

1:14:21.421 --> 1:14:23.420
for family business.

1:14:23.422 --> 1:14:24.354
All right?

1:14:24.356 --> 1:14:25.190
That's it.

1:14:26.059 --> 1:14:26.893
Kostas!

1:14:28.328 --> 1:14:29.893
Kostas!

1:14:29.895 --> 1:14:30.729
Rebecca?

1:14:33.032 --> 1:14:34.067
Rebecca.

1:14:35.033 --> 1:14:35.866
What happened?

1:14:35.868 --> 1:14:37.268
Babe, where were you?

1:14:37.270 --> 1:14:39.836
What the fuck
is she doing here?

1:14:39.838 --> 1:14:40.804
I work here.

1:14:40.806 --> 1:14:42.373
Thank God you're okay.

1:14:42.375 --> 1:14:45.175
What the fuck
is going on Arman?

1:14:45.177 --> 1:14:46.576
I was waiting for you.

1:14:46.578 --> 1:14:47.611
What happened?

1:14:47.613 --> 1:14:49.245
I got fucking kidnapped.

1:14:49.247 --> 1:14:50.947
- What?
- Who darling?

1:14:50.949 --> 1:14:54.585
By him, that fucking creep.

1:14:54.587 --> 1:14:56.053
Omer?

1:14:56.055 --> 1:14:57.588
No, darling, no.

1:14:57.590 --> 1:14:59.522
Omer is the head serf.

1:14:59.524 --> 1:15:01.192
He locked me in
his fucking van.

1:15:01.194 --> 1:15:02.927
I will fucking kill you.

1:15:02.929 --> 1:15:04.128
A serf Arman, he's more man

1:15:04.130 --> 1:15:05.595
than you'll ever be.

1:15:05.597 --> 1:15:06.464
Get fucked Jamila.

1:15:06.466 --> 1:15:07.732
Hey!

1:15:07.734 --> 1:15:09.299
Oh, fuck, this place is
like a fucking brothel.

1:15:09.301 --> 1:15:11.102
What did you do Omer?

1:15:11.104 --> 1:15:13.036
Omer wouldn't hurt a fly.

1:15:13.038 --> 1:15:15.473
Sorry, Rebecca,
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

1:15:15.475 --> 1:15:17.074
Omer, why'd you do this?

1:15:17.076 --> 1:15:18.209
Don't pick on him.

1:15:18.211 --> 1:15:19.809
Shut the fuck up bitch.

1:15:19.811 --> 1:15:20.745
You shut up slut.

1:15:20.747 --> 1:15:22.479
You breach the order again,

1:15:22.481 --> 1:15:23.981
this time you're going
to jail so fuck you.

1:15:23.983 --> 1:15:25.950
Babe, I know you're upset,

1:15:25.952 --> 1:15:26.916
but please just calm down.

1:15:26.918 --> 1:15:28.119
You will never get Ruby.

1:15:28.121 --> 1:15:30.355
I don't fucking want her.

1:15:37.462 --> 1:15:39.062
Yes.

1:15:39.064 --> 1:15:40.932
It is true that I
attacked this lady.

1:15:41.801 --> 1:15:43.401
Omer, are you for real?

1:15:43.403 --> 1:15:45.803
Because I want
for Jamila and Arman

1:15:45.805 --> 1:15:47.604
to speak alone.

1:15:47.606 --> 1:15:49.740
But I asked you to go.

1:15:49.742 --> 1:15:51.744
And you were very rude to me.

1:15:52.944 --> 1:15:55.947
But I'm sorry, lady, okay.

1:15:57.250 --> 1:15:58.749
They had things,

1:15:58.751 --> 1:16:01.751
a husband and wife
must say to each other

1:16:01.753 --> 1:16:03.286
before it ends.

1:16:03.288 --> 1:16:05.522
No messages on computer.

1:16:05.524 --> 1:16:08.291
No fucking bullshit lawyers.

1:16:08.293 --> 1:16:11.394
They have to be alone to say it.

1:16:11.396 --> 1:16:13.496
It was all love.

1:16:13.498 --> 1:16:16.666
And when it ends, it's very sad.

1:16:16.668 --> 1:16:19.402
There's a little
girl in the middle.

1:16:19.404 --> 1:16:20.907
She feels sad, too.

1:16:21.841 --> 1:16:24.875
The hearts break, freeze.

1:16:24.877 --> 1:16:27.178
Life hurts us.

1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:29.446
Gods doesn't protect us.

1:16:29.448 --> 1:16:32.751
It has become
broken from sadness.

1:16:34.487 --> 1:16:38.755
I could never leave my
Berta now for someone else

1:16:38.757 --> 1:16:42.492
and then try to take her
children away from her.

1:16:42.494 --> 1:16:46.530
No, this is not love.

1:16:46.532 --> 1:16:48.632
I don't judge you Arman

1:16:48.634 --> 1:16:52.236
and maybe if I had long
enough with my wife,

1:16:52.238 --> 1:16:54.671
maybe I understand
the temptation

1:16:54.673 --> 1:16:56.840
of another woman,

1:16:56.842 --> 1:17:01.644
but inside my heart,
now is forever

1:17:01.646 --> 1:17:04.015
and our children by her side.

1:17:04.917 --> 1:17:06.784
My friend Sally,

1:17:06.786 --> 1:17:08.887
she says to me that
I must move on.

1:17:09.788 --> 1:17:11.490
I know it is true.

1:17:12.725 --> 1:17:14.325
But.

1:17:14.327 --> 1:17:17.163
You can never grow
over a broken heart.

1:17:21.300 --> 1:17:24.403
I never got the
chance to say goodbye.

1:17:25.771 --> 1:17:29.440
I never got to the chance
to mend my children.

1:17:29.442 --> 1:17:30.842
Give me one more.

1:17:31.978 --> 1:17:36.849
I never got a chance
to say goodbye.

1:17:39.152 --> 1:17:40.319
To kiss Berta.

1:17:44.489 --> 1:17:46.658
To hold her hand.

1:17:49.729 --> 1:17:53.298
To be with her when she died.

1:17:54.801 --> 1:17:59.271
To kiss Ismet and my little boy.

1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:06.945
I never got a chance to
give one last hug and kiss

1:18:07.546 --> 1:18:12.317
to my daughter.

1:18:13.519 --> 1:18:18.291
I couldn't tell her
how much I love her.

1:18:19.391 --> 1:18:20.326
I love her.

1:18:32.070 --> 1:18:32.904
Hey.

1:19:03.402 --> 1:19:05.169
Kostas.

1:19:05.171 --> 1:19:07.004
I'm in breach of
my working visa.

1:19:07.006 --> 1:19:08.405
Okay, go home, leave tomorrow.

1:19:08.407 --> 1:19:10.243
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:19:13.045 --> 1:19:13.878
Hello, officers.

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:15.044
Please come in.

1:19:15.046 --> 1:19:16.679
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello.

1:19:16.681 --> 1:19:18.648
We're looking for a
Kostas Cyriaki, is that you?

1:19:18.650 --> 1:19:20.017
Yes.

1:19:20.019 --> 1:19:21.852
Constable Farley,
Constable Louie,

1:19:21.854 --> 1:19:23.254
we're from the
Miraben Police Station

1:19:23.256 --> 1:19:24.321
around the corner.

1:19:24.323 --> 1:19:25.488
Just need to have a chat to you.

1:19:25.490 --> 1:19:26.826
What happened?

1:19:27.827 --> 1:19:29.159
You folks all right?

1:19:29.161 --> 1:19:30.593
Yeah, yeah,
we're just leaving.

1:19:30.595 --> 1:19:32.062
Thank you Kostas

1:19:32.064 --> 1:19:35.465
for an interesting night.

1:19:35.467 --> 1:19:38.434
Rebecca, next
time we dance, yes.

1:19:38.436 --> 1:19:39.637
Yeah.

1:19:39.639 --> 1:19:42.106
Okay, thank you so
much, okay, good night.

1:19:42.108 --> 1:19:43.307
Good night.

1:19:43.309 --> 1:19:44.141
Thank you Kostas.

1:19:44.143 --> 1:19:45.009
Okay.

1:19:45.011 --> 1:19:46.242
Yes, Arman.

1:19:46.244 --> 1:19:48.711
Sir, do you ride
in a white vehicle,

1:19:48.713 --> 1:19:50.546
it's a BMW 2014 model

1:19:50.548 --> 1:19:54.250
with the registration
LG zed 611?

1:19:54.252 --> 1:19:55.520
Is that your car?

1:19:56.421 --> 1:19:58.088
Yes.

1:19:58.090 --> 1:19:59.723
Would you like
something to drink.

1:19:59.725 --> 1:20:01.125
A glass of water or something.

1:20:01.127 --> 1:20:01.959
Water would be good.

1:20:01.961 --> 1:20:02.793
Water?

1:20:02.795 --> 1:20:03.628
Katerina.

1:20:06.032 --> 1:20:07.099
Water please.

1:20:08.199 --> 1:20:09.199
Mr. Cyriaki?

1:20:09.201 --> 1:20:10.233
Oh, you can call me Kostas.

1:20:10.235 --> 1:20:11.634
Kostas.

1:20:11.636 --> 1:20:13.637
Under Section 60 of
the Road Safety Act,

1:20:13.639 --> 1:20:15.171
you're required to
give us information

1:20:15.173 --> 1:20:17.174
as to who was driving
that vehicle tonight.

1:20:17.176 --> 1:20:18.174
It's been involved
in an incident

1:20:18.176 --> 1:20:19.509
down on South Road.

1:20:19.511 --> 1:20:20.843
It was about 8:20 p.m.

1:20:20.845 --> 1:20:23.381
Can you tell me who
was driving your car?

1:20:25.484 --> 1:20:28.454
It's really important that
you answer our questions.

1:20:29.322 --> 1:20:30.221
Thanks.

1:20:34.859 --> 1:20:36.125
Yes.

1:20:36.127 --> 1:20:37.093
Um.

1:20:37.095 --> 1:20:38.361
Sir, you can't drink that.

1:20:38.363 --> 1:20:39.763
I'm here to talk to
you about your car

1:20:39.765 --> 1:20:41.831
that's been involved
in an incident.

1:20:41.833 --> 1:20:43.133
If you were driving it tonight,

1:20:43.135 --> 1:20:44.335
we're going to have
to breath test you.

1:20:44.337 --> 1:20:45.671
Can you put it down please?

1:20:48.073 --> 1:20:49.040
All right.

1:20:50.509 --> 1:20:51.808
We need you to tell us

1:20:51.810 --> 1:20:54.012
who was in possession
of your vehicle tonight.

1:21:03.389 --> 1:21:08.394
I bought this car
for my son, he drives.

1:21:09.127 --> 1:21:09.793
I see.

1:21:09.795 --> 1:21:10.928
What happened?

1:21:10.930 --> 1:21:12.161
Was he speeding?

1:21:12.163 --> 1:21:13.496
Kostas, your
son left the scene

1:21:13.498 --> 1:21:15.400
of an accident tonight.

1:21:16.502 --> 1:21:17.768
You can have that water now,

1:21:17.770 --> 1:21:20.806
but we need to ask you
a few more questions.

1:21:24.577 --> 1:21:26.078
What's going on?

1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:31.180
I think everything
is gonna be okay.

1:21:31.182 --> 1:21:32.018
Totally.

1:21:40.292 --> 1:21:41.558
You won't get Ruby.

1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:44.330
I don't
fucking want her.

1:21:45.497 --> 1:21:48.565
Wow, well, that's
got them fucked.

1:21:48.567 --> 1:21:50.634
Good boy Samir.

1:21:58.010 --> 1:21:59.476
I have to go Omer,

1:21:59.478 --> 1:22:01.678
but thank you for everything.

1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:02.515
It's nothing.

1:22:04.216 --> 1:22:05.317
No, that's not true.

1:22:08.587 --> 1:22:10.019
I'll give you a lift.

1:22:10.021 --> 1:22:11.621
Yeah, that would be great.

1:22:11.623 --> 1:22:13.757
Good night Katerina.

1:22:13.759 --> 1:22:15.291
Good night baby.

1:22:15.293 --> 1:22:16.860
Thanks Kat.

1:22:16.862 --> 1:22:18.361
You on tomorrow?

1:22:18.363 --> 1:22:20.630
Unfortunately, yes.

1:22:20.632 --> 1:22:21.865
Hey.

1:22:21.867 --> 1:22:24.434
Don't stop for any
pizzas tonight, okay.

1:22:24.436 --> 1:22:25.501
No.

1:22:25.503 --> 1:22:26.738
Goodnight Omer.

1:22:27.605 --> 1:22:28.839
Come on Omer,

1:22:28.841 --> 1:22:30.007
let's go for a smoker.

1:22:30.009 --> 1:22:31.543
All right, dear.

1:22:32.912 --> 1:22:35.081
You're not gonna
kidnap me, are you?

1:22:35.914 --> 1:22:37.983
No promises.

1:22:55.333 --> 1:22:56.333
Katerina.

1:22:56.335 --> 1:22:57.770
Come and have a look.

1:23:00.472 --> 1:23:03.708
Oh, it's fucking playing.

1:23:56.996 --> 1:23:57.829
Hey!

1:23:59.832 --> 1:24:00.930
Ch!

1:24:00.932 --> 1:24:03.099
Hey!

1:24:03.101 --> 1:24:04.468

1:24:06.971 --> 1:24:09.474

1:24:14.445 --> 1:24:16.047
Sks, sks, exa, exa.

1:24:23.956 --> 1:24:24.789

1:24:25.757 --> 1:24:26.858
Bravo possum.

1:24:37.403 --> 1:24:39.402
Little possum.
