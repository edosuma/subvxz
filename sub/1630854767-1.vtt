WEBVTT

00:17.118 --> 00:18.952
Five, four...

00:19.120 --> 00:20.421
Command engine start.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.790
Two, one. Ignition.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.475
WOMAN:
Oh, yeah, look at her go!

00:41.642 --> 00:43.677
Mission control has confirmed
New Shepard has cleared

00:43.811 --> 00:46.780
the tower on her way
to space from Launch Site One

00:46.880 --> 00:50.684
in the west Texas desert with
Mannequin Skywalker on board.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.358
JEFF:
I was born into great wealth.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.227
Not monetary wealth,

00:59.360 --> 01:00.994
but the wealth
of a loving family.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.365
A family that fostered
my curiosity

01:04.965 --> 01:07.000
and encouraged me
to dream big.

01:09.337 --> 01:13.741
My mom, Jackie, had me
when she was 17 years old.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.913
My dad's name is Miguel.
He adopted me when I was four.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.084
He was 16 when he came
to the United States

01:24.218 --> 01:27.488
from Cuba, shortly after
the Castro Regime.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.393
My dad didn't speak English

01:32.526 --> 01:34.862
and he did not have
an easy path.

01:34.995 --> 01:38.098
What he did have was grit
and determination.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.202
Together,
with my grandparents,

01:41.369 --> 01:43.036
these hard-working,

01:43.171 --> 01:46.039
resourceful, and loving
people made me who I am.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.447
I walked away from
a steady job on Wall Street

01:53.581 --> 01:56.450
into a Seattle garage
to pursue my dream,

01:56.917 --> 01:59.687
fully understanding
that it might not work.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.425
It feels just like yesterday
I was driving packages

02:04.558 --> 02:06.059
to the post office myself,

02:06.727 --> 02:10.298
dreaming that one day
we might afford a forklift.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.135
You earn trust slowly,
over time,

02:15.269 --> 02:17.205
doing hard things well.

02:18.071 --> 02:21.209
We offer fast shipping
and everyday low prices.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.977
We make promises
to our customers

02:24.111 --> 02:25.546
that we intend to keep.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.816
We make principled decisions,

02:28.949 --> 02:32.653
however unpopular,
and our approach is working.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.039
Jeff, David just asked
about you, let's go.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.309
-We're late.
-Shit!

03:30.844 --> 03:33.947
Oh, my goodness,
how are you always late?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.883
'Cause I'm always working.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.719
Let's see how well that excuse
works on David.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.190
-Is this a sleeping bag?
-No.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.533
You do know that
that's a poor answer

03:52.666 --> 03:54.335
to tell me that
that's a jump bag

03:54.502 --> 03:55.969
instead of a sleeping bag

03:56.069 --> 03:57.738
when you have a pillow
sticking out of it?

03:57.871 --> 04:01.174
-You believe it.
-Come on, man.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.477
Okay, here we go.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.245
Mr. Bezos,
thanks for joining us.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.847
You mean, I had a choice?

04:06.980 --> 04:08.516
Back to what
we were talking about.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.351
Look, we're not gonna
spend all day

04:10.484 --> 04:12.019
talking about how great
our quarter was.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.721
Our numbers are fine,

04:13.854 --> 04:15.389
but that's not
what we're gonna do.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.057
We wanna talk about
how we're gonna move

04:17.190 --> 04:18.692
the business forward, right?

04:18.859 --> 04:20.728
So, I wanted to spend
a little time going over

04:20.861 --> 04:22.696
an idea that Anton
and his team brought us.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.666
Let's put it up on the board.
Online brokerage.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.570
The idea that we would
actually start transacting

04:29.703 --> 04:31.872
completely online.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.107
Where consumers
can go on and instantaneously

04:34.241 --> 04:35.843
execute a trade.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.045
Now, I think all of you
are kind of wondering

04:38.211 --> 04:39.713
how it's gonna affect us
on the fee side,

04:39.880 --> 04:41.415
and there's gonna be less fee,

04:41.549 --> 04:43.216
but there's also gonna be
less cash going out.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.052
That's a win-win for everybody,
isn't it?

04:45.185 --> 04:47.721
As we move forward,
I wanna see good ideas,

04:47.855 --> 04:50.090
the next big idea.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.292
Does that make sense to you?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.695
And remember one thing:

04:54.795 --> 04:56.263
It's all about the data.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.232
I don't know, I just...

05:33.601 --> 05:34.968
feel like I'm in a rut.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.939
Sometimes like I don't want
to get back into writing.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.774
You should, 100%.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.445
Yeah, but there's
no money in that.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.680
Could be.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.482
You're an amazing writer,
you know that.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.819
You're my husband,
you have to say that.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.454
I'm serious!

05:53.621 --> 05:55.088
Some of the stuff
you've written

05:55.188 --> 05:56.757
just makes me want to cry.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
-Ugh.
-And I have several times.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.528
-Oh, stop.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.369
You're amazingly talented.
You know that.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.341
Thank you.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.978
It's just easier said
than done sometimes.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.050
With the job and all, I just
don't have as much time for it.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.489
And it's not like
I don't love my job,

06:28.656 --> 06:30.891
I'm so grateful
for the opportunity, but...

06:32.526 --> 06:36.564
I never imagined myself
as a glorified secretary.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.568
You're not a secretary.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.336
You're a novelist trapped
in a boring job,

06:43.504 --> 06:45.205
believe me, I know.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.842
Yeah. VP of the company
understands.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.012
Things are good right now,

06:52.980 --> 06:55.749
but I always pictured I'd start
a business or something.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.652
Never thought that I'd just end
up as another hedge fund guy.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.089
Well, what's stopping you?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.225
Just gotta be there.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.995
No, seriously,

07:08.095 --> 07:10.197
what's-- what's stopping you
from starting your own company?

07:10.363 --> 07:11.932
A business idea.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.067
There's the logistics,
the supply chain,

07:14.201 --> 07:15.703
I-- I don't know
the first thing

07:15.836 --> 07:17.538
about getting a business off
the ground.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.541
Plus, I have a steady job,
why would I risk that?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.710
No, no. Forget that!

07:22.876 --> 07:24.377
You can get another job
if you wanted to.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.046
I mean, with a mind like yours,

07:26.179 --> 07:27.781
you'd get hired
anywhere in an instant.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.217
Seriously.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.356
If you wanna start
your own company,

07:36.456 --> 07:38.225
you should go for it.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.798
You're right.
You're right.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.567
No more excuses.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.738
And there is something.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.473
I read an article
the other day.

07:54.041 --> 07:59.780
Did you know that the internet
is growing at 2,300% a year?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.250
Holy shit, that's a lot.

08:03.416 --> 08:07.254
Yeah. That's an understatement.
Nothing grows at 2,300%.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.722
Ever.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.293
Yeah.

08:14.094 --> 08:18.265
I mean, that's the
million-dollar idea, I guess.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.433
It's-- It's numbers, really,

08:20.601 --> 08:23.270
but if I could find a way
to capitalize on it...

08:24.304 --> 08:26.640
I mean, imagine
if we started a business

08:26.774 --> 08:29.442
and in its first year
did a million dollars in sales

08:29.610 --> 08:31.411
and grew 2,300%.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.947
That means its second year
would do $23 million,

08:34.114 --> 08:36.183
and then if it grew
another 2,300%

08:36.316 --> 08:39.687
it would do $529 million
in its third year.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.324
-Wow.
-Yeah.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.961
Could be the idea
David's been looking for.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.131
Well, are you gonna
tell him about it?

08:51.665 --> 08:54.201
Not yet. I don't even know
what we're gonna sell.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.606
Whatever it is...

09:00.641 --> 09:01.942
it could be big.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.486
Move!
First time in New York?

11:35.162 --> 11:36.496
-Jeff! Jeff!
-One quick minute.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.031
Jeff, he's on a call!

11:38.165 --> 11:39.366
A great opportunity.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.801
I'd-- It'd be a real honor.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.702
Absolutely.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.038
I agree.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.374
-What is this?
-Tomorrow's best idea.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.276
Okay, Tom,
let me give you a call back,

11:49.376 --> 11:50.944
something just came up, okay?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.345
Hey, thanks so much.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.949
That was a friend
at the White House.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.285
President's asking me
to be on his council

11:58.385 --> 12:00.120
for science and technology.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.856
-Congratulations.
-Well, it's important, right?

12:03.323 --> 12:05.192
But obviously
not as important as this.

12:05.325 --> 12:09.396
Tell me something that grows
at a 2,300% annual growth rate.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.032
Outside of petri dishes,
nothing.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.368
Forget about it, keep reading.
Right there.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.237
That's a month's work,
right there.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.172
Jeff,
if you don't shut the fuck up

12:19.339 --> 12:20.908
it's gonna take me
a month to read it.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.076
Forget about it.
Let me bottom line it.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.513
-Books.
-Books? That's your idea?

12:26.646 --> 12:27.848
It's tomorrow's best idea.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.549
The one
you've been looking for.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.052
Jeff, I haven't been looking
for books. In fact,

12:32.185 --> 12:34.354
I don't even know what
the fuck you're talking about.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.689
-Have you gotten any sleep?
-Let me explain it to you.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.860
See, millions of copies of
books are published every year

12:39.993 --> 12:42.362
and-- and millions more
internationally,

12:42.863 --> 12:45.933
but a physical store can only
carry several thousand books.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.667
Well, that's true
of any retailer.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.169
Right, take Barnes & Noble.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.005
$1.6 billion a year in sales.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.775
But any physical
Barnes & Noble store

12:55.909 --> 12:58.078
only has thousands of copies.

12:58.912 --> 13:02.382
Now, add several
of Barnes & Noble stores,

13:02.549 --> 13:04.451
and you still
have thousands of copies.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.120
But there's potentially
millions of copies

13:07.254 --> 13:09.589
that could be sold,
but not in a physical store.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.726
Now, imagine a virtual store

13:16.563 --> 13:19.766
that was open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

13:21.534 --> 13:24.637
and could carry an infinite
amount of books,

13:24.771 --> 13:26.874
potentially every book
that ever existed.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.076
Jeff, do me a favor.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.078
Go wash up, shave,

13:31.211 --> 13:32.645
and that sleeping bag
that you have?

13:32.779 --> 13:34.481
Go take a little nap.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.150
And I want you to meet me
in the park in an hour, okay?

13:57.104 --> 14:00.107
-You clean up nice.
-Thanks, David.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.810
You know, it's a great idea
with a good plan.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.748
I'm so relieved you--
you liked it.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.450
I mean, with 76--

14:10.617 --> 14:12.519
Take a look at that guy
over there.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.456
Now take a look at that guy.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.028
Which one
do you think's happier?

14:23.830 --> 14:25.532
-The one with the hotdog.
-Why do you say that?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.834
He's living for the moment.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.637
Does that mean that the other
guy's miserable? Right?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.973
Maybe. Yeah.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.976
Let's jump ahead 20 years
to 2014.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.877
Who do you think's
gonna be happier,

14:38.011 --> 14:40.313
the guy eating hotdogs
that didn't plan for his future

14:40.447 --> 14:42.215
or the guy
who worked his ass off

14:42.349 --> 14:44.151
to get where he wanted to go?

14:44.651 --> 14:47.120
People always make
the same mistake.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.456
They focus on short-term goals
instead of planning

14:49.556 --> 14:51.959
for the future, instead
of planning for the future

14:52.059 --> 14:54.694
and using a short-term strategy
to execute it.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.998
You're the youngest
vice president

14:58.165 --> 15:00.467
of the fastest growing
hedge fund in America.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.735
You make a six-figure salary.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.672
Your coworkers respect you,

15:05.838 --> 15:08.408
and you want to throw all of
that away to, what, sell books?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.810
I thought you liked the idea,
David.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.312
I do like the idea.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.214
I actually think
it's a great idea,

15:14.347 --> 15:16.416
but it's not for me,

15:16.549 --> 15:19.186
and I definitely don't think
it's for you.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.389
Jeff, you're brilliant
and you're ambitious

15:22.522 --> 15:24.357
and I love that about you,

15:25.858 --> 15:29.196
but, ultimately,
you have to think bigger, okay?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.564
You have a career to grow,
and you have places to go

15:31.698 --> 15:33.200
and you have a family
to take care of

15:33.366 --> 15:34.767
and your wife wants
to move your--

15:34.901 --> 15:36.369
your whole family forward.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.406
But I don't think that's
gonna happen with your plan.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.911
Okay? Let's head out.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.583
Well,
what Alisson should know--

15:50.717 --> 15:52.552
MAN ON TV:
What is internet, anyway?

15:53.420 --> 15:56.689
Internet is that
massive computer network.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.891
Starting your own business
is one of the most

15:59.059 --> 16:00.960
challenging things you can do.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.196
The risk often outweighs
the rewards,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.732
but I'm telling you,
if you know what you're doing

16:05.898 --> 16:07.434
and you got nothing
to lose,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.536
then why not, right?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.039
That's because fear-- fear is
what runs the human heart.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.107
Hey.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.109
But if you got the
guts to face what's ahead--

16:16.243 --> 16:19.779
-When'd you get home?
-A little while ago.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.748
I didn't have
two pennies to rub together.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.783
But I didn't let it
slow me down, you know why?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.585
I'll tell you why.
When I was a kid,

16:25.718 --> 16:27.454
I used to caddy at this
country club.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.988
And every morning...

16:32.125 --> 16:35.095
Brought some take out.
You hungry?

16:38.731 --> 16:40.500
Those biscuits
will ruin your dinner.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.941
-What'd you get?
-Chinese.

17:07.660 --> 17:12.832
So... you gonna tell me
why you left work early today?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.037
No reason.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.873
Oh, come on, I know
you had your pitch with David

17:21.007 --> 17:23.310
and look at you,
you're wallowing in self-pity.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.145
No, I'm not.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.679
Jeff, you're a terrible liar.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.151
He's not interested, okay?

17:32.452 --> 17:33.720
Well, why not?

17:33.853 --> 17:35.188
He said it was a great idea,

17:35.322 --> 17:37.056
just not for the company
or for me.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.726
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

17:39.859 --> 17:42.362
It means I shouldn't be
taking risks like this.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.166
And he asked me, would I risk
everything for this idea?

17:46.299 --> 17:47.900
And, honestly, I wouldn't.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.503
Well,
why wouldn't you risk it all?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.408
I don't think the risk
is worth the opportunity.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.180
I have a steady career,
we have a family.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.815
What if we wanna
have kids one day?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.851
I can't be living
with this kind of risk.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.587
Whoa, whoa, hold up there,
cowboy.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.859
Listen, if we wanna have kids,

18:13.025 --> 18:14.861
we'll discuss
that in the future.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.729
Later on down the line.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.533
As for your job,
you can get another one.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.536
You're Jeff Bezos,

18:23.703 --> 18:26.706
the youngest VP
in the history of D.E. Shaw.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.775
you really think
this is your only opportunity

18:28.908 --> 18:30.210
for a good job in the future?

18:31.378 --> 18:32.612
Hell no!

18:33.213 --> 18:35.047
Whatever it is
you choose to do,

18:35.182 --> 18:37.550
you're going to be
incredible at.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.453
I know it.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.224
And if this is something
that you wanna do,

18:44.724 --> 18:46.092
then I believe in you.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.796
And you need to believe
in yourself,

18:49.929 --> 18:52.765
'cause you're not just someone
who takes unnecessary risks,

18:52.899 --> 18:56.269
you're someone who-- who
looks at the possibilities,

18:56.403 --> 18:58.070
runs the numbers,

18:58.238 --> 19:00.106
and then takes the chances
that are worth taking!

19:04.611 --> 19:06.746
You said to think
about the future, right?

19:10.082 --> 19:12.219
Is D.E. Shaw
really what you envision

19:12.319 --> 19:14.053
for the rest of your life?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.942
Regret... minimization.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.946
What?

19:41.948 --> 19:43.950
Regret minimization framework.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.319
I need to minimize
the amount of regrets

19:46.453 --> 19:47.787
that I'm gonna have by age 80.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.291
Okay, that's--
that's one way to look at it.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.962
See, I'm not gonna regret being
a part of this Internet thing,

19:56.095 --> 19:59.432
but I will regret not trying,
and if it fails, who cares?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.635
I'm not living my life
in regret.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.804
So, you're gonna go for it?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.205
Yeah, we're going for it!

20:07.006 --> 20:10.109
All right, Internet man!
So, what's our next move?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.611
We're quitting our jobs.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.816
I'm sorry. We?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.486
Yeah. I'm not doing
this without you.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.890
And we're not starting
a business venture here.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.860
-I need you.
-But-- But...

20:27.994 --> 20:29.362
We can do this.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.732
It's gonna be okay.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.503
We have savings,
we're gonna be together.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.706
You can have time to write.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.212
It's gonna work out.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.850
-Okay. Okay, I'm in.
-Okay? Doing it?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.385
-We're doing it.
-We're doing it!

20:56.055 --> 20:58.925
-You're amazing.
-I'm so excited for us.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.593
This is gonna work.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.229
-I'm scared, but I'm excited.
-I'm scared, too!

21:04.731 --> 21:06.065
Zander.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.834
Hey, it's Jeff Bezos.

21:08.568 --> 21:13.373
Yeah, MacKenzie's great.
I'm starting a new business.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.708
We're gonna sell
on the Internet.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.910
Yeah, Warren, Internet.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.913
I-N-T-E-R-N-E-T.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.017
Yeah.
You have a modem, right?

21:26.386 --> 21:29.188
Yeah, you're gonna
go online and buy.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.558
You know how you said
if I ever had a big idea

21:31.691 --> 21:33.893
to call you and-- and, um--
This is it.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.062
We're starting a website.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.398
Website.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.733
Yeah, Nancy. Okay.

21:42.569 --> 21:45.472
Hmm. We don't have a name
for it yet.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.906
Valuation?

21:48.541 --> 21:50.242
A million dollars?

21:50.377 --> 21:53.245
Yeah, Bill, the valuation
isn't determined yet.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.082
We don't know what the profit
margins are gonna be.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.951
No. I'm working
on the business plan.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.954
No, I've never started
a business before.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.991
That's the point,
it's called a startup.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.094
How about instead of saying
it's a startup business,

22:08.260 --> 22:13.633
why don't you tell them
it's an investment opportunity?

22:14.100 --> 22:16.803
If you just invest $50,000...

22:17.604 --> 22:21.441
Yeah. Listen, David.
It's going to be big.

22:21.608 --> 22:22.909
We're still working
on the plan,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.276
but-- but we'd love
to invite you

22:24.444 --> 22:25.778
to be one
of the first investors.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.847
What do you mean
I'd make a terrible CEO?

22:34.954 --> 22:36.288
How much is it?

22:37.624 --> 22:38.958
$50,000.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.629
Can't even start
a business with that.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.196
No, that can't be,

22:44.330 --> 22:46.032
we must've called
over 60 people today.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.700
And half of them said no.

22:50.302 --> 22:51.538
Maybe we can get a loan?

22:52.338 --> 22:55.341
No bank is gonna lend us money.
We're a startup.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.010
What do we do, then?

22:59.278 --> 23:00.647
I don't know.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.127
Let's go.

23:19.198 --> 23:23.069
-You sure about this?
-It's our only option.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.705
But it's up to you.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.041
All right.

23:36.683 --> 23:39.385
There you are! Oh!

23:40.386 --> 23:43.355
-Hey, Mom.
-You made it!

23:43.490 --> 23:45.024
Why didn't you give us
some warning?

23:45.191 --> 23:47.193
I-- I would've rolled out
the red carpet.

23:47.326 --> 23:48.861
You know me,
spontaneous to a fault.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.563
Did you hear that?

23:50.697 --> 23:53.700
He's about as spontaneous
as a stopwatch.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.236
Oh, you look exhausted.
Well, come on in, come in.

23:58.037 --> 24:01.040
-Oh, Mike, they're here!
-Oh, my God!

24:01.207 --> 24:03.375
That's my boy. Oh, welcome!

24:04.544 --> 24:07.680
So good to see you!
You look great!

24:07.780 --> 24:09.281
So happy you guys made it,
look at this!

24:09.415 --> 24:10.683
-Hey, Dad.
-Welcome.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.118
This is so great
you guys are here!

24:12.251 --> 24:14.053
Feels so good when you're here,

24:14.220 --> 24:16.055
thank you so much, you guys,
for coming. Gonna be great.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.590
Okay, I've gotta ask,

24:17.724 --> 24:19.058
is he still totally
unorganized?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.227
-Mom!
-Yes.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.763
You know, when he was a kid,
he used to be just like that.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.732
He had so many inventions,
remember, Mike,

24:25.898 --> 24:28.367
up in his room that we finally
had to turn over the garage

24:28.467 --> 24:31.070
-to make it your workshop!
-Thanks, Mom.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.939
Oh, Mike, would you take the
luggage? Take their luggage.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.074
We're gonna have a good time,
we're so happy.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.442
-Thank you. All right.
-Thank you.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.110
So...

24:41.581 --> 24:44.416
-Oh, my gosh, is that you?
-It's me.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.152
MACKENZIE:
That is such a cute photo.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.088
A lot of memories, eh?

24:49.221 --> 24:51.290
Ah! We're so happy
you guys are here.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.259
-Let's sit, sit, come on.
-Let's go.

24:55.261 --> 24:58.965
So, is it happening?
Are we gonna be grandparents?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.434
-No.
-No.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.470
-Oh!
-Not yet.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.606
This is a great time for you,
you are so busy

25:06.739 --> 25:08.507
and you're doing so many
great things, it's better

25:08.641 --> 25:10.777
to keep working now,
have the kid when you're ready.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.144
How's work?

25:12.845 --> 25:17.483
Actually... we quit our jobs.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.286
-You quit?
-Yeah.

25:20.452 --> 25:21.688
Both of you guys?

25:22.288 --> 25:23.656
-Yep.
-Yep.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.425
Did you have a fight
with David?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.460
No, things are fine with David,
you know,

25:28.628 --> 25:30.462
I think he's one
of the smartest people I know,

25:30.630 --> 25:32.865
and somebody that uses
both sides of his brain.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.935
But, um, just,
an opportunity came up

25:36.035 --> 25:37.604
that we just couldn't pass up.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.639
So, you got another offer?

25:40.472 --> 25:42.474
No, Mom, um...

25:43.009 --> 25:46.679
We're actually starting
a business online.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.480
On the Internet.
Selling books.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.817
The Internet?

25:50.983 --> 25:53.886
So, the Internet, it's a vast
network of computers

25:54.020 --> 25:57.356
that communicate with each
other and transfer information,

25:57.489 --> 26:01.193
so why couldn't this network
be used to conduct commerce?

26:01.794 --> 26:05.397
And we've identified
the potential

26:05.531 --> 26:09.669
of selling books through
the Internet as a business.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.237
Well, why would you want
to do that?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.972
Why wouldn't you just go
to the store?

26:13.072 --> 26:16.042
A physical store
can never have every book

26:16.175 --> 26:17.977
that ever existed.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.680
And our virtual store could
potentially have every book

26:20.847 --> 26:22.514
and we'll just ship it to you.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.751
Mm-hmm.

26:24.884 --> 26:28.054
And plus, the internet's
growing at 2,300% a year.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.156
Well, how do you know that?

26:30.690 --> 26:33.059
Well, we've found several
analyst reports

26:33.192 --> 26:35.161
and we've been identifying
other businesses

26:35.261 --> 26:37.830
that-- that have seen that kind
of growth and we believe

26:37.930 --> 26:39.732
we can achieve
that selling books.

26:40.199 --> 26:43.102
I don't know, guys, I think
this seems really risky.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.037
Couldn't you, like,
do this on nights

26:45.171 --> 26:47.373
and weekends,
and keep your current job?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.376
No.

26:50.877 --> 26:53.279
Mom, we-- we already
quit our jobs.

26:53.412 --> 26:57.884
And... we'll regret
not trying this business.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.886
That's actually why we're here.

27:00.019 --> 27:04.256
We were hoping that you both
would consider investing.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.360
How much do you need?

27:09.028 --> 27:10.396
Couple hundred thousand.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.737
Three hundred would be great.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.709
You each would get a couple
percentage points and ownership

27:22.809 --> 27:25.077
in the business and,
if it's successful,

27:25.244 --> 27:27.246
it could be millions
of dollars for you.

27:27.980 --> 27:32.985
But I have to warn you, there's
a 70% chance it could fail.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.824
I mean, that's the majority

27:37.957 --> 27:39.759
of our retirement fund, honey.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.160
When do you need it by?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.165
Tomorrow.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.768
Well, I've got an idea.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.770
Dinner's almost ready.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.105
Why don't we have a nice dinner

27:53.239 --> 27:55.842
and we can just talk
about this later?

28:45.825 --> 28:47.493
-You're up early.
-Yeah.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.998
I just wanna tell you,

28:52.131 --> 28:54.500
I don't invest in you
and I hope you understand that.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.376
Why?

29:05.044 --> 29:06.846
You know, it's an idea
that you have to understand,

29:06.979 --> 29:08.380
it takes
a lot of planning,

29:08.514 --> 29:11.050
a lot of things,
and we don't have a lot.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.052
But I'm not gonna tell you,

29:13.185 --> 29:15.054
you know how much
you represent to me.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.389
And I just want to tell you
something.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.591
We live in a free country.
I believe in America

29:19.725 --> 29:21.894
that every dreams
can come true.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.763
And the main thing that I want
you to know...

29:26.065 --> 29:27.433
that I believe in you.

29:27.566 --> 29:28.767
So, I'm going
to give you something.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.202
These are life savings.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.840
Thanks, Dad.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.875
-I love you.
-I love you.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.682
I won't let you down.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.252
I know that.
Absolutely, I know that.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.726
Can I ask you
for another favor?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.728
Another favor now?

29:57.229 --> 29:59.131
Can I borrow the truck?

29:59.265 --> 30:01.067
Oh, my God,
you gonna kill me.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.069
Your mom is gonna kill me, too,
because you know that--

30:03.235 --> 30:05.104
Go ahead, enjoy yourself.
Today's a big day.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.783
So, where are we heading?

30:18.750 --> 30:20.552
Just keep heading west, babe.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.755
Okay.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.928
-I'll figure it out soon.
-I mean, take your time.

30:29.095 --> 30:31.297
The movers are only,
I don't know,

30:31.430 --> 30:33.099
18 hours behind us,
I don't--

30:33.265 --> 30:35.567
I'm sure they don't mind
driving aimlessly.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.270
It's probably not
the first time they do.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.612
You sure
we're at the right place?

30:47.113 --> 30:48.747
Um, you picked it.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.789
Thank you.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.809
I think I figured out
where we're going.

31:18.644 --> 31:22.114
Oh. I'm really starting
to like the nomad life, though.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.650
Well, normally,
an analysis like this

31:24.816 --> 31:27.053
would take several months,
but since we have 24 hours

31:27.186 --> 31:28.620
to notify the movers,

31:28.720 --> 31:30.289
I've narrowed it down
to one city.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.192
It's a city
with a favorable tax structure,

31:33.325 --> 31:36.662
a reasonable cost of living,
a highly qualified workforce,

31:36.828 --> 31:38.330
and access to ports.

31:38.864 --> 31:40.166
Ports?

31:40.699 --> 31:42.868
'Cause we'll be getting
so many books from Asia?

31:43.002 --> 31:46.805
You never know.
So, drumroll, please.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.144
We're moving to...
Seattle, Washington.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.916
-Hmm.
-You're not excited.

31:58.684 --> 32:02.921
I mean, the coffee's good,
right?

32:03.055 --> 32:04.690
There's more than just
coffee in Seattle.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.594
I better call the movers.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.762
Yeah, they're gonna need
an actual address.

32:10.896 --> 32:13.032
At least they know
where to point the truck now.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.637
I wanna show you something.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.989
You're about to see
something beautiful.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.930
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah. Cadabra.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.170
-What?
-Cadabra.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.272
That's the name of our company.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.342
Like magic.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.292
So, you're sure
he's gonna do it for a price?

33:47.193 --> 33:48.494
Excellent.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.163
He's a divorce lawyer,
of course!

33:53.199 --> 33:55.334
How exactly is opening
a corporation

33:55.467 --> 33:56.702
like dissolving a marriage?

33:57.303 --> 33:59.171
All right, thank you.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.540
Great, so you'll have a draft
for us by Wednesday.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.810
I'll send you my address
in Seattle once we get there.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.547
Yeah. Cadabra, Inc.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.883
Like Abra Cadabra. Yeah.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.821
No, no. Not a cadaver.
Cadabra.

34:17.189 --> 34:21.360
Yep. No, no, we're not selling
any magic supplies, just books.

34:22.461 --> 34:23.695
Thank you.

34:28.667 --> 34:32.504
Hey, Shel.
How are you? Jeff Bezos.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.474
Yep. Peter Leventhal's friend.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.411
So, we're heading your way,

34:39.545 --> 34:41.147
wanted to see
if you're available tomorrow.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.482
Get some breakfast
and we can talk about a job.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.653
Yep.
San Francisco, perfect.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.488
All right.
Call you in the morning.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.534
GRANDPA:
Okay, here we go, Jeff.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.704
Uh, with your left hand
take the nail like this,

35:06.905 --> 35:09.608
and with your right hand hold
the hammer like that, okay?

35:09.741 --> 35:11.877
Hold it, hold it
with strength, okay?

35:12.010 --> 35:16.548
And then subtly tap on the nail
to seed it in place.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.851
And then when you're ready,
hit it a little harder.

35:20.419 --> 35:24.290
Then take your left hand away
and give it a whack.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.892
-Okay.
-Okay? Try that.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.535
-Did I do it good!
-Yeah, you did it!

35:36.635 --> 35:40.239
All right, drink up!
You boys need to stay hydrated.

35:40.406 --> 35:41.707
Oh, yeah.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.311
Thanks, Grandma.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.145
Supper's ready in 30 minutes.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.980
Go inside and get cleaned up.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.783
I'm making grandpa's
special dish today.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.252
Mm.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.322
You know, you always
wanna have great people

35:56.455 --> 35:57.756
in your life, Jeff.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.593
It's the one way to stay happy.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.134
But make sure
it has at least three bedrooms

36:09.268 --> 36:11.136
and an attached garage.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.605
May I ask why?

36:13.772 --> 36:15.307
I want us to be like

36:15.441 --> 36:17.676
all the great American
suburb stories.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.945
Apple. Dell. Disney.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.614
They all started in a garage.

36:23.148 --> 36:25.016
-You serious?
-Yeah.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.619
But no more than 800 a month.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.690
-Seems like kind of a lot.
-Seven hundred.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.660
And we need the keys tomorrow.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.363
I think the movers are
in Nebraska already.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.797
Okay.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.632
Oh, he's here.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.936
Hi, Shel.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.874
Jeff. My wife, MacKenzie.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.609
MacKenzie. Nice to meet you.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.778
-I'll leave you to it.
-Great.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.946
So, Paul speaks
very highly of you.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.515
Said he doesn't know anybody
that can build

36:56.648 --> 36:58.284
a database as fast as you.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.386
Yeah, I was part of the team
that wrote script decks.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.354
-Oh, impressive stuff.
-It was.

37:02.488 --> 37:05.524
You were also part of the whole
Earth catalogue, correct?

37:05.657 --> 37:07.058
-Indeed.
-Yeah, great.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.560
-You want a coffee?
-Sure.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.062
I'll have a large coffee
and whatever he's having.

37:11.196 --> 37:13.031
Cappuccino.

37:13.164 --> 37:16.201
I'll pay 'cause we actually
have startup capital.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.870
It's from my parents,
don't be overly impressed.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.506
Here.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.015
This is the whole
business plan?

37:30.148 --> 37:33.084
Mm, no, just what I was able
to get done

37:33.218 --> 37:35.186
between Fort Worth and now.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.723
Um, I'll have the rest done
by the time we get to Seattle.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.660
-Books, huh? Nothing else?
-That's it.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.564
You got a name yet?

37:46.064 --> 37:49.868
-Cadabra.
-Cadaver? Like a dead body?

37:50.035 --> 37:53.104
No. Cadabra.
Like a magic trick.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.206
That's much better.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.009
Now,
based on your qualifications,

37:58.109 --> 38:00.612
why are you perfect
for this programming job?

38:01.713 --> 38:04.350
I was under the impression
you were pitching me a job.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.586
-Yeah, but--
-I didn't drive all the way up

38:07.719 --> 38:09.721
from Santa Cruz
to be interviewed.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.392
-I kinda thought it'd be both.
-It's not.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.126
You'd be very lucky to have me.

38:16.227 --> 38:17.563
Probably right.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.297
-I am.
-Fine.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.066
The job is yours
if you want it.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.768
I commend your good judgement.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.270
Now, I must warn you,
the pay is shit,

38:25.404 --> 38:27.238
you will be working
barbaric hours,

38:27.406 --> 38:29.274
but you will receive
some stock options

38:29.408 --> 38:30.909
and it will be
the most difficult project

38:31.042 --> 38:32.444
you've ever worked on.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.947
You know, most tech startups
never make it.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.083
See, in the book business,

38:38.216 --> 38:39.918
there's a huge disparity
between supply and demand

38:40.085 --> 38:41.753
and it's virtually impossible

38:41.920 --> 38:44.790
for a physical bookstore
to carry millions of books.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.660
So, if you're able to build us
a website that can handle

38:48.794 --> 38:52.764
a product category that large,
we will be successful.

38:53.599 --> 38:54.833
Welcome aboard.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.672
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, those dates are perfect.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.109
Amazing. Yeah, great.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.011
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when we arrive.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.446
Okay.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.949
-He's in.
-Well, that was easy.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.452
How'd it go on your end?

39:13.619 --> 39:15.120
You're not the only one
having success.

39:15.253 --> 39:17.989
-Oh!
-Our new home.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.461
Perfect.

39:28.634 --> 39:29.968
-Pleasure.
-Thank you.

39:34.305 --> 39:35.841
Yeah.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.391
Maybe we should've seen it
first before renting.

39:53.525 --> 39:54.826
It's perfect.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.472
That's gotta go.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.521
What do you think?

40:24.155 --> 40:25.691
Potential at best.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.193
Everything we need's
right here.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.265
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:45.043 --> 40:48.046
We came all the way
from New York for this?

40:48.580 --> 40:50.281
Yeah, this is our new offices.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.183
Got it.

42:07.458 --> 42:08.694
Hey, look who's here!

42:08.827 --> 42:10.762
-Hey, Paul!
-Jeff!

42:10.862 --> 42:13.264
Good to see you.
Paul, meet Shel.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.866
Your reputation precedes you.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.636
-Same.
-How was the farewell party?

42:17.769 --> 42:19.971
I'm a bit hungover,
honestly.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.673
They threw me quite
the sendoff.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.942
Even gave me a lovely gift.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.979
They're a bit skeptical of
Cadabra's chances of success,

42:28.146 --> 42:30.148
so they took up a collection
to tide me over

42:30.315 --> 42:31.482
while I look for work.

42:33.151 --> 42:36.487
-Almost $27.
-Wanna buy some shares?

42:37.122 --> 42:38.824
Mind if I take a peek
at the books first?

42:38.990 --> 42:40.826
Come on,
let me show you your new home.

42:43.461 --> 42:45.563
I just finished setting up
the new computer system.

42:45.697 --> 42:47.165
I went with
high-powered servers.

42:47.332 --> 42:48.867
Splendid.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.501
Only problem is
they draw so much power,

42:50.669 --> 42:52.403
I had to run each one
off a different circuit.

42:53.004 --> 42:54.405
They work great,

42:54.539 --> 42:56.474
so long as you don't plug
anything else in.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.147
Shit. Gimme a second.

43:05.050 --> 43:07.853
-MacKenzie.
-Yes?

43:08.019 --> 43:11.056
-What're you doing?
-Drying my hair!

43:11.189 --> 43:15.026
I told you, don't plug anything
in while we're working.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.195
Well,
what am I supposed to do, then?

43:17.362 --> 43:19.364
Don't plug in any appliances!

43:19.898 --> 43:22.600
Sorry, guys.

43:25.570 --> 43:27.538
All right, guys.
Got some stuff

43:27.673 --> 43:29.708
I want to share with you.
Let me get my notes.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.609
I thought
he came from finance?

43:31.743 --> 43:33.544
Is he a programmer, too?

43:34.012 --> 43:36.614
He majored in computer
science at Princeton.

43:36.748 --> 43:38.549
Oh, dear.

43:38.684 --> 43:40.551
So, I've gone ahead
and analyzed every software

43:40.719 --> 43:42.453
in the marketplace and,
unfortunately,

43:42.587 --> 43:44.555
most of 'em were built
for a mail order system.

43:44.723 --> 43:46.892
The customer places the order,
the order's processed,

43:47.025 --> 43:48.593
and then the inventory's
updated

43:49.094 --> 43:51.562
with three typical product
availabilities: in stock,

43:51.730 --> 43:53.364
out of stock, and unavailable.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.201
Our website's gonna
have seven of them:

43:56.968 --> 43:58.603
shipped within 24 hours,

43:58.737 --> 44:00.205
shipped within two
to three days,

44:00.305 --> 44:01.707
shipped within one
to two weeks,

44:01.807 --> 44:03.374
shipped within four
to six weeks,

44:03.474 --> 44:05.877
not yet published,
out of stock,

44:05.977 --> 44:08.714
and, for hard to find titles,
shipped within three months.

44:09.948 --> 44:11.316
So, what does this all mean?

44:11.449 --> 44:12.818
Indeed.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.120
We need to build
our own software.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.055
So, we're going open source?

44:17.155 --> 44:18.589
We don't have a choice.

44:18.757 --> 44:20.425
You see,
we don't have the finances

44:20.591 --> 44:22.593
to hire a bunch of programmers
to build this for us.

44:22.728 --> 44:24.595
So, we're gonna count
on thousands of programmers

44:24.763 --> 44:28.433
around the world to build it
for us and update it for us,

44:28.566 --> 44:31.669
which is gonna allow us to
focus on what really matters.

44:32.904 --> 44:35.774
Selling books.
Make sense?

44:36.274 --> 44:38.476
So, if we're gonna build
the world's greatest bookstore,

44:38.609 --> 44:40.478
we're gonna need
the world's greatest website.

44:41.246 --> 44:42.480
Let's get to it.

44:43.982 --> 44:45.951
-Jeff.
-Yeah?

44:46.117 --> 44:47.685
I feel the need
to remind you that,

44:47.819 --> 44:49.955
given all the things
you want the site to do,

44:50.121 --> 44:52.357
no one's ever built anything
even remotely like it before.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.159
Exactly.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.494
While we're attempting
the impossible,

44:56.627 --> 44:58.363
what will you be doing?

44:58.496 --> 45:00.698
Attempting the improbable.

45:00.832 --> 45:02.533
I need to raise
a million dollars

45:02.667 --> 45:04.469
if we're gonna get this website
live by summer.

45:05.170 --> 45:08.473
If you're serious about
this timeline, we'll need help.

45:08.639 --> 45:10.541
Fine. Put an ad out.

45:10.675 --> 45:12.010
Which reminds me...

45:15.480 --> 45:18.016
Never again
will we be referred

45:18.149 --> 45:19.985
to as the website
that sells dead bodies.

45:20.151 --> 45:22.287
Cadabra.com is defunct.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.693
Our new name is--
Drumroll...

45:33.198 --> 45:35.200
Relentless.com.

45:41.506 --> 45:44.042
Nick, it's Jeff.
How are you?

45:44.675 --> 45:47.712
You signed the contract,
you said you were sending

45:47.846 --> 45:50.348
the check, and then you put
a stop payment on the check.

45:50.481 --> 45:52.583
Do you understand
how that affects our company?

45:52.717 --> 45:55.020
What do you mean you don't
understand what we're doing?

45:55.186 --> 45:57.655
Yeah, I'm just following up
on that investment

45:57.755 --> 45:59.357
you committed to.

45:59.524 --> 46:01.860
A lot of great companies
have started in a garage.

46:02.027 --> 46:04.362
Apple. Microsoft.

46:04.529 --> 46:06.164
Um, yep.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.699
The company's still going,
but we really need you

46:08.867 --> 46:10.535
to send us the money,
if you can.

46:10.701 --> 46:13.704
It's a virtual Internet store.

46:14.205 --> 46:16.007
There's no physical location.

46:16.107 --> 46:18.176
That's not our business model.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.211
If you're not interested,
just tell me.

46:20.378 --> 46:23.214
We're selling books.

46:23.714 --> 46:25.917
I don't care
if you changed your mind,

46:26.051 --> 46:27.385
if you make commitments,

46:27.552 --> 46:28.887
you gotta
follow through in life.

46:29.054 --> 46:30.956
You can't have
two million products

46:31.089 --> 46:33.391
inside of a bookstore!

46:33.524 --> 46:35.060
You think we're gonna fail?

46:35.693 --> 46:37.295
Well, I think
you're gonna fail.

47:35.420 --> 47:37.188
It's still a little bit
too confusing.

47:37.956 --> 47:39.958
What do you mean?
It's a standard landing page.

47:40.125 --> 47:42.193
You need to imagine that all
of our customers have never

47:42.327 --> 47:43.661
used a computer before.

47:44.162 --> 47:47.865
The homepage has to be very...
user-friendly.

47:47.999 --> 47:50.035
I can't work
on this change tonight,

47:50.168 --> 47:51.869
-I'll work on it tomorrow.
-No, no.

47:52.003 --> 47:53.804
Let's get it done now
while the ideas are fresh.

47:53.939 --> 47:55.473
Jeff, with all due respect,

47:55.640 --> 47:57.375
we've been at this
for 12 hours straight.

47:57.508 --> 47:59.310
And there's 24 hours
in the day, Shel.

47:59.477 --> 48:02.847
I'll redraft it.
And burn the midnight oil.

48:04.215 --> 48:06.517
Jeff?

48:06.651 --> 48:09.387
-One second.
-Jeff.

48:10.021 --> 48:11.822
One second, MacKenzie.

48:17.695 --> 48:19.130
Is it important?

48:20.331 --> 48:24.169
-No. It's fine.
-I'll be up in a bit.

48:24.335 --> 48:26.071
What's a bit?

48:26.204 --> 48:27.505
I don't know!

48:33.878 --> 48:35.346
Goodnight, fellas.

48:36.514 --> 48:38.049
PAUL & SHEL: Night.

50:10.475 --> 50:13.178
-Thank you so much.
-Do you have your receipt?

50:13.311 --> 50:15.613
-Hi, your name?
-Vazquez.

50:15.780 --> 50:19.484
-Hello. How are you?
-Thank you.

50:19.617 --> 50:21.519
-Thank you for attending.
-Of course.

50:21.652 --> 50:23.688
-Hi, your name?
-Hi. Bezos.

50:23.821 --> 50:25.456
Bezos.

50:25.623 --> 50:28.359
-Here.
-Thank you.

50:28.493 --> 50:30.628
Thank you. Hi.

50:30.795 --> 50:33.298
-Okay, okay.

50:33.464 --> 50:36.134
Now it's time
for you brave souls

50:36.801 --> 50:40.805
to stand up and tell us
about yourselves.

50:41.306 --> 50:44.008
Who you are,
your hopes and dreams.

50:45.976 --> 50:47.312
Who's gonna go first?

50:48.779 --> 50:51.216
-Okay.
-Okay. Hi.

50:51.349 --> 50:54.152
Hi, I'm Molly Jean Andrews

50:54.285 --> 50:57.188
and I'm from
Green Valley, Arizona,

50:57.322 --> 51:01.159
and I'm opening up a little
shop called Kitchen Bible.

51:01.326 --> 51:03.661
And I have a few cookies.
Do you wanna try one?

51:03.828 --> 51:05.663
All right. Um, you know,

51:05.796 --> 51:07.498
there's gonna be nothing
but cookbooks.

51:07.665 --> 51:09.634
I'm not looking to get rich
or anything,

51:09.734 --> 51:12.002
I just don't wanna lose
my shirt either.

51:16.841 --> 51:21.246
Hello. I'm Charles Allen Morrow
from Highland Park, Illinois.

51:21.746 --> 51:26.050
My shop, Marrow's Antiquaria,
opening in August,

51:26.184 --> 51:29.254
is going to be specializing
in rare books

51:29.387 --> 51:31.856
and autographs in all fields.

51:32.022 --> 51:34.992
-Okay, anybody else?

51:35.893 --> 51:37.195
Oh, please!

51:38.028 --> 51:39.864
Hi. How are you?

51:39.997 --> 51:42.900
Um, my name is Jeff, Jeff Bezos
from Seattle, Washington,

51:43.033 --> 51:45.603
and I'm mainly here to learn
more about the book business

51:45.736 --> 51:48.239
because this summer
we'll be launching

51:48.373 --> 51:51.376
the world's largest bookstore,
relentless.com.

51:53.378 --> 51:54.712
A bit overzealous
for a bookstore.

51:54.845 --> 51:56.214
Don't you think?

51:56.381 --> 51:58.449
Well, I can--
I can explain, actually.

51:58.583 --> 52:01.252
The reason why it'll be
the world's largest bookstore

52:01.386 --> 52:03.388
is because its vast library

52:03.554 --> 52:06.257
is gonna exist exclusively
on the Internet.

52:07.258 --> 52:10.528
-Okay, well...

52:11.396 --> 52:13.731
Let's move on
to the other topics, then.

52:16.267 --> 52:18.035
Um, excuse me one second.

52:18.135 --> 52:20.938
-Hey. Internet guy.
-Who, me?

52:21.071 --> 52:23.308
-Yes, you.
-Hi, how're you doing, sir?

52:23.441 --> 52:25.810
-Do you know who I am?
-Of course. Mr. Leonard Riggio.

52:25.943 --> 52:28.145
-And you are?
-Jeff. Jeff Bezos.

52:30.114 --> 52:31.549
Care to have a drink with me,
Jeff?

52:37.255 --> 52:39.290
See, since books
are a true commodity,

52:39.424 --> 52:41.926
it seemed like the ideal
first product to sell online,

52:42.059 --> 52:43.928
being that books
in every physical--

52:44.094 --> 52:45.796
-Can I get you anything else?
-We're fine.

52:46.431 --> 52:49.099
Books in all your physical
locations are identical.

52:49.234 --> 52:50.835
So, customers
should be comfortable

52:50.968 --> 52:52.470
purchasing them online.

52:53.103 --> 52:56.307
Hmm. Seems like an interesting
idea you have there.

52:56.441 --> 52:58.943
Well, it's more
than just an idea.

52:59.109 --> 53:01.346
-Is it, though?
-Yeah.

53:01.479 --> 53:03.113
I mean, we have programmers
working on it now,

53:03.248 --> 53:04.782
we'll be live this summer.

53:04.915 --> 53:06.984
But until it actually
comes to fruition,

53:07.117 --> 53:09.620
and more than anything,
actually proves to be viable,

53:09.787 --> 53:11.622
it's... just an idea.

53:11.789 --> 53:13.591
What did you say
you're calling it again?

53:13.691 --> 53:14.959
Relentless.

53:15.626 --> 53:17.928
Huh. Peculiar name.

53:19.163 --> 53:21.131
Doesn't quite fit the book
industry, though, does it?

53:21.299 --> 53:22.500
How so?

53:23.133 --> 53:25.836
"Relentless,"
I mean, it's aggressive.

53:25.970 --> 53:27.372
You're trying
to lure bookworms in,

53:27.505 --> 53:29.173
you're not trying
to ready them for battle.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.175
See, I never looked
at it that way.

53:31.309 --> 53:33.010
I always thought
our competitors

53:33.143 --> 53:35.646
would see us a certain way,
not-- not the consumer.

53:35.813 --> 53:38.048
And that right there is why
Relentless will never be

53:38.182 --> 53:39.984
anything more
than just an idea.

53:40.485 --> 53:43.220
But, you see,
we're open to an investment

53:43.354 --> 53:45.656
and maybe a partnership
with Barnes & Noble

53:45.823 --> 53:47.558
where we are your Internet
fulfillment wing.

53:47.692 --> 53:50.194
No, I-- I'm sorry, James.

53:50.328 --> 53:53.163
-Uh, Jeff.
-Right. Jeff, uh...

53:53.831 --> 53:55.366
We don't do that.

53:55.500 --> 53:57.335
You see,
we're not just gonna be

53:57.468 --> 53:59.003
another independent bookseller.

53:59.136 --> 54:00.905
Okay. Stop right there.

54:01.038 --> 54:03.508
Right. Do you-- Do you know
who you're speaking to?

54:04.309 --> 54:06.243
-Of course.
-But do you really?

54:06.377 --> 54:07.678
Because I'm not
just Leonard Riggio.

54:07.845 --> 54:09.914
I am Barnes & Noble, Inc.

54:10.047 --> 54:13.083
Biggest book retailer in
the entire industry, all right?

54:13.217 --> 54:15.420
And we just had an 87%
gain in revenue

54:15.553 --> 54:16.821
over the last quarter alone.

54:16.921 --> 54:18.389
I'm well aware of your success.

54:18.523 --> 54:20.325
Oh, well, then
you should also be aware

54:20.425 --> 54:22.192
that we're about to open
100 more stores this year.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.094
And then it's only a matter
of time before

54:24.228 --> 54:26.764
independent booksellers such
as yourself become obsolete.

54:26.897 --> 54:29.199
I have no interest
in investing in anything

54:29.367 --> 54:31.201
other than my own company.

54:31.936 --> 54:34.004
But it's more about the future.

54:34.104 --> 54:35.706
Would you like some advice?

54:35.873 --> 54:38.008
-It's Jeff, right?
-Yeah.

54:38.108 --> 54:40.277
Um, I think you should go find
another business

54:40.411 --> 54:41.946
to look at.

54:42.079 --> 54:43.681
Take whatever money you have
and put it into

54:43.781 --> 54:45.616
the manufacturing
sector or something.

54:45.750 --> 54:48.118
I-- It's-- You know, they're
having a lot of growth lately.

54:48.252 --> 54:50.721
But you will never find
success in the book industry,

54:50.855 --> 54:52.557
I can guarantee you that.

54:53.057 --> 54:56.060
I'd like to say that
it was good chatting with you,

54:56.193 --> 54:58.028
but, frankly,
it was a waste of time.

54:58.696 --> 55:01.231
That is for the drinks.

55:01.732 --> 55:03.434
And whatever is leftover,
you can consider

55:03.568 --> 55:05.470
it seed money
for a new business venture.

55:58.789 --> 56:00.791
MACKENZIE:
You don't have to be quiet.

56:00.925 --> 56:02.159
I waited up.

56:06.464 --> 56:09.133
-How'd it go?

56:11.301 --> 56:13.638
-Terrible.
-Why? What happened?

56:13.804 --> 56:15.473
I don't wanna talk about it.

56:15.640 --> 56:18.308
Oh, come on.
I'm just asking about your day.

56:18.976 --> 56:21.278
MacKenzie,
I don't wanna talk about it.

56:23.514 --> 56:25.049
It was a complete waste
of time.

56:25.182 --> 56:26.617
Nobody's interested
in our company.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.118
Is that what you wanna hear?

56:33.658 --> 56:35.159
Is this how it's gonna be
from now on?

56:35.325 --> 56:36.794
Like what?

56:38.496 --> 56:40.831
-Like what?
-Like this!

56:40.998 --> 56:43.333
We barely talk, and when
we do talk, you just yell.

56:43.868 --> 56:45.736
-I'm not yelling.
-Yes, you are!

56:45.870 --> 56:47.538
You're yelling.

56:47.672 --> 56:49.540
No, ever since we got here
I can't talk to you

56:49.674 --> 56:52.176
without you getting upset
at me or telling me to shut up.

56:52.342 --> 56:54.579
In case you haven't realized,
I have a company

56:54.712 --> 56:56.547
that I'm trying to get off
the ground.

56:57.147 --> 56:59.584
So, excuse me if I don't
give you 100% of my attention--

56:59.717 --> 57:01.586
I don't want 100%
of your attention,

57:01.719 --> 57:03.721
I just want a fraction of it.

57:07.658 --> 57:09.026
Please.

57:12.530 --> 57:15.199
This is my life, MacKenzie,

57:15.332 --> 57:17.568
and I have everything
in the world invested

57:17.702 --> 57:20.270
in this business
and I will not fail.

57:20.404 --> 57:23.841
I will work 24 hours a day
to make sure that I succeed.

57:23.941 --> 57:26.511
And I'm sorry
if I don't make you a priority.

57:27.044 --> 57:29.847
-We.
-What're you talking about?

57:29.947 --> 57:32.116
We put everything
we had into this.

57:32.249 --> 57:35.385
In case you forgot, I quit
my job and moved here for you!

57:35.920 --> 57:37.387
Give me a break.

57:38.723 --> 57:39.957
Jeff.

57:42.392 --> 57:43.961
You're a really smart guy.

57:44.562 --> 57:46.430
Hell, the smartest guy
I've ever met,

57:46.564 --> 57:48.398
but you've been acting
like a complete dick

57:48.566 --> 57:49.800
since we've gotten here.

57:51.401 --> 57:53.571
How can you not see
how you're acting?

57:56.607 --> 58:01.411
We have a business
that has taken hundreds

58:01.546 --> 58:04.081
of thousands of dollars
of investor funds,

58:04.615 --> 58:08.418
that is days away
from potentially closing.

58:08.586 --> 58:11.255
We have the shittiest
fucking name on the planet,

58:11.421 --> 58:14.759
relentless.com,
that doesn't appeal

58:14.892 --> 58:16.594
to any of our customer base.

58:17.227 --> 58:19.329
So, we need to understand

58:19.463 --> 58:22.299
that Jeff may not have time
for MacKenzie.

58:22.432 --> 58:23.901
God.

58:24.001 --> 58:25.670
'Cause we have other
priorities.

58:25.803 --> 58:28.105
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying.

58:29.106 --> 58:30.808
I get that you have a lot
going on.

58:30.941 --> 58:32.977
I get that everything
is riding on this idea

58:33.110 --> 58:35.479
and I'm not asking you
to stop focusing on that.

58:35.613 --> 58:37.514
I'm asking you to be present.

58:39.316 --> 58:40.751
Be a little more human,
for God's sake.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.186
You're so absorbed
in the computer,

58:42.319 --> 58:43.954
it's like you're not even here.

58:47.124 --> 58:48.626
Whoa, look at that!

58:48.793 --> 58:50.327
-Lot of smoke.
-Yeah.

58:51.361 --> 58:53.998
Okay. Mm-hmm.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.834
Okay. There's some little
coolant over here,

58:56.967 --> 58:58.703
so why don't you
hand me that, Jeff?

59:02.106 --> 59:03.373
There we go.

59:09.179 --> 59:10.480
Okay.

59:13.450 --> 59:15.219
All right,
do you wanna turn it on now?

59:18.656 --> 59:20.891
-Hey!
-Whoa, you fixed it!

59:21.025 --> 59:22.827
You should see a mechanic,
though.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.662
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

59:24.795 --> 59:26.030
You're a godsend.

59:35.372 --> 59:37.642
Okay, here we go.

59:37.742 --> 59:40.510
You know, we really, really did
a good job here today.

59:40.678 --> 59:42.579
We helped out--
Jeff, hey.

59:42.713 --> 59:44.381
-Listen to me, pay attention.
-Okay.

59:44.514 --> 59:46.751
We helped out today,
it's important to give back,

59:46.884 --> 59:49.419
and it's all about
just being human.

59:50.020 --> 59:51.388
-Right?
-Yes, Grandpa.

59:51.521 --> 59:53.157
-So, help me up.

59:54.424 --> 59:55.726
Jeff.

59:55.860 --> 59:57.094
Jeff.

59:59.196 --> 1:00:01.531
Jeff, are you seriously
not paying attention right now?

1:00:02.532 --> 1:00:05.703
-I've gotta go.
-Go where?

1:00:05.870 --> 1:00:07.604
I have an idea.

1:00:07.738 --> 1:00:09.774
-I need to go to the garage.
-Are you fucking kidding me!

1:00:09.907 --> 1:00:11.608
See, this is what I'm talking
about, you're obsessed!

1:00:11.742 --> 1:00:13.911
We'll talk tomorrow about this.

1:00:14.044 --> 1:00:15.780
No, don't treat me like
I'm one of your employees!

1:00:15.913 --> 1:00:18.048
-Jeff!

1:00:23.087 --> 1:00:24.454
Hey, guys!

1:01:17.942 --> 1:01:23.347
-Hey! How was your trip?
-You look like shit.

1:01:25.115 --> 1:01:26.683
Well,
I haven't slept at all.

1:01:27.617 --> 1:01:30.187
But it was worth it.
I figured something out.

1:01:31.655 --> 1:01:33.958
First off,
relentless.com is out.

1:01:34.859 --> 1:01:36.493
It makes us sound crazy.

1:01:36.626 --> 1:01:38.829
We don't want our secret
getting out, now, do we?

1:01:40.297 --> 1:01:42.299
See, whatever we call ourselves

1:01:42.466 --> 1:01:44.534
has to be something
we never need to change.

1:01:44.668 --> 1:01:46.470
Can it start
with the letter "A"?

1:01:46.636 --> 1:01:48.705
Search engines
have started ranking

1:01:48.839 --> 1:01:50.975
the sites alphabetically,
so being right at the top

1:01:51.141 --> 1:01:52.542
would be a huge advantage.

1:01:52.676 --> 1:01:54.678
-Interesting.
-I've got it.

1:01:56.146 --> 1:01:57.447
aar.com.

1:01:59.016 --> 1:02:00.350
With two "A"s.

1:02:01.986 --> 1:02:03.687
Short for "aardvark"?

1:02:04.855 --> 1:02:06.190
Keep working on it.

1:02:06.857 --> 1:02:10.327
You see, I realized, we've
been missing a critical factor.

1:02:10.460 --> 1:02:12.196
It doesn't matter
if our product library

1:02:12.329 --> 1:02:15.532
is the size of seven
New York City phone books,

1:02:15.665 --> 1:02:17.167
there's something
we've been missing.

1:02:17.334 --> 1:02:19.036
-Can you guess what it is?
-Wouldn't dare.

1:02:19.169 --> 1:02:21.671
What's the easiest
way to build customer loyalty?

1:02:21.839 --> 1:02:24.341
Um, coupons?

1:02:24.842 --> 1:02:26.076
Close.

1:02:26.977 --> 1:02:31.681
You see, when you go
to that independent bookstore,

1:02:31.816 --> 1:02:32.983
you can take your time.

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:35.319
Browse.
No pressure to buy.

1:02:35.419 --> 1:02:36.987
You know you're getting
a fair price.

1:02:37.087 --> 1:02:38.889
That human touch.

1:02:39.023 --> 1:02:42.259
Now, imagine we can create
that human touch virtually.

1:02:43.093 --> 1:02:48.532
Putting the customer first
no matter what all the time.

1:02:48.698 --> 1:02:50.100
Exactly.

1:02:50.234 --> 1:02:52.402
You see, our competitors
are all focused

1:02:52.536 --> 1:02:54.004
on what they're all doing.

1:02:54.104 --> 1:02:56.040
They're not focused
on the customer.

1:02:56.206 --> 1:02:58.175
We will be focused
on the customer.

1:02:58.275 --> 1:03:00.277
When they get to our home page,
they're gonna see

1:03:00.410 --> 1:03:04.214
our entire product library,
fair prices, fast shipping,

1:03:04.348 --> 1:03:05.582
easy returns.

1:03:06.050 --> 1:03:07.551
No matter what it costs.

1:03:08.886 --> 1:03:10.720
The customer is always first.

1:03:12.722 --> 1:03:14.558
Can you make the homepage
do that?

1:03:14.724 --> 1:03:16.426
It's complicated.

1:03:17.527 --> 1:03:20.730
I know. Do it.

1:03:49.593 --> 1:03:51.061
Still angry?

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:57.467
I'm sorry.

1:04:02.806 --> 1:04:07.011
Look, I know I've been
a little distracted by work,

1:04:07.144 --> 1:04:09.113
but I'm sorry.

1:04:17.121 --> 1:04:19.789
I don't need you to apologize
for focusing on the company.

1:04:19.924 --> 1:04:22.459
I-- I get
that that's important.

1:04:25.629 --> 1:04:28.698
I need you to apologize
for being an asshole.

1:04:30.434 --> 1:04:33.137
Okay, I get it, you've been
working 18-hour days,

1:04:33.270 --> 1:04:35.505
you're losing money,
you've barely eaten or slept

1:04:35.639 --> 1:04:37.507
or showered, I get that.
I see it.

1:04:38.808 --> 1:04:40.610
But that doesn't give you
a right to treat me

1:04:40.710 --> 1:04:42.346
the way
you've been treating me.

1:04:48.318 --> 1:04:49.686
You're right.

1:04:51.821 --> 1:04:53.890
I've lost focus
on what's important

1:04:55.993 --> 1:04:58.695
and it will never happen again.

1:05:04.734 --> 1:05:06.036
I love you.

1:05:10.474 --> 1:05:12.042
I love you, too.

1:05:16.346 --> 1:05:20.050
So, how's the site
coming along?

1:05:20.184 --> 1:05:21.751
Work in progress.

1:05:21.885 --> 1:05:24.021
I got the boys working
on something right now.

1:05:24.188 --> 1:05:26.523
Yeah?
What're they working on?

1:05:27.857 --> 1:05:30.260
Something to help
improve customer experience,

1:05:30.394 --> 1:05:33.530
give people that in-store
touchy feeling.

1:05:33.663 --> 1:05:36.233
You know, the human touch
when shopping.

1:05:38.202 --> 1:05:39.769
You came up with that
on your own?

1:05:39.903 --> 1:05:41.671
Yeah,
last night in the garage.

1:05:45.709 --> 1:05:47.844
Still gotta figure out a new
name for the site, though.

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:50.880
Wait. You're a writer.

1:05:51.048 --> 1:05:52.716
You should have hundreds
of ideas.

1:05:54.218 --> 1:05:55.519
Okay.

1:05:57.054 --> 1:05:59.223
-I don't know.
-Come on.

1:06:01.725 --> 1:06:05.229
But I-- I struggle with titles,
like, I...

1:06:08.732 --> 1:06:15.239
How 'bout...
earthsbiggestbookstore.com?

1:06:16.906 --> 1:06:19.576
Little wordy.
Great tagline, though.

1:06:21.078 --> 1:06:22.312
Sorry.

1:06:22.446 --> 1:06:24.914
Anyways,
we have bigger fish to fry.

1:06:26.250 --> 1:06:28.252
-Investors?
-Yup.

1:06:28.785 --> 1:06:31.588
I sometimes feel like these
investors are just wasting

1:06:31.755 --> 1:06:33.590
my life away, to be honest.

1:06:34.924 --> 1:06:36.760
I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

1:06:39.263 --> 1:06:40.764
It better happen soon.

1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:45.402
We're running out of time.

1:06:46.436 --> 1:06:48.905
The plan's
to open 97 new superstores

1:06:49.005 --> 1:06:52.242
in addition to its already
existing 261 locations.

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:54.244
Will this be the end
for independent booksellers?

1:06:54.344 --> 1:06:55.979
Would you mind
turning that TV off?

1:06:58.615 --> 1:07:00.817
-Up next!

1:07:06.956 --> 1:07:08.325
Still don't like it.

1:07:09.693 --> 1:07:11.128
Why not?

1:07:11.795 --> 1:07:13.463
It's not clever enough.

1:07:15.299 --> 1:07:16.966
You said you wanted it simple.

1:07:17.634 --> 1:07:20.504
Simple, but it needs
to have a little bit of...

1:07:20.637 --> 1:07:21.971
What's that word?

1:07:22.106 --> 1:07:24.341
-Charm?
-Exactly.

1:07:24.474 --> 1:07:28.812
You see, it needs to be
charming, make customers smile.

1:07:33.317 --> 1:07:34.651
What's a smile again?

1:07:35.352 --> 1:07:37.487
I think it's the opposite
of that.

1:07:42.192 --> 1:07:43.860
We'll tackle it after lunch.

1:07:44.728 --> 1:07:46.330
You care to join us?

1:07:47.364 --> 1:07:48.898
Not today, boys.

1:07:49.032 --> 1:07:51.301
I need to go have lunch
with an investor.

1:07:54.371 --> 1:07:55.705
-Jeff.
-Yeah.

1:07:55.839 --> 1:07:57.241
Before you go...

1:07:58.542 --> 1:08:00.377
There's a couple of things
that we've been meaning

1:08:00.510 --> 1:08:02.146
-to talk to you about.
-Sure.

1:08:02.246 --> 1:08:05.048
First,
any luck getting us that help?

1:08:05.582 --> 1:08:08.152
The ad's out, but, you know,
I haven't got any leads.

1:08:08.252 --> 1:08:10.420
You mean this job ad?

1:08:12.021 --> 1:08:14.658
"You must have experience
designing and building large

1:08:14.758 --> 1:08:16.760
and complex,
yet maintainable systems,

1:08:16.893 --> 1:08:19.095
and you should be able to do
so in about one-third

1:08:19.229 --> 1:08:21.565
of the time that most competent
people think possible."

1:08:21.698 --> 1:08:24.234
-Perfect.
-"You should have a master's

1:08:24.368 --> 1:08:25.902
degree or doctorate
from a top university.

1:08:26.035 --> 1:08:28.605
World class communication
skills are essential."

1:08:28.738 --> 1:08:30.207
Excellent.

1:08:32.176 --> 1:08:33.543
You go.

1:08:33.710 --> 1:08:35.545
It'll sound nicer
in an English accent.

1:08:36.546 --> 1:08:38.215
With all due respect,
Jeffrey,

1:08:38.882 --> 1:08:40.717
have you lost your bloody mind?

1:08:41.218 --> 1:08:42.786
Why on Earth would someone

1:08:42.919 --> 1:08:44.621
with those qualifications
want to work here?

1:08:44.754 --> 1:08:46.223
You're both working here.

1:08:46.390 --> 1:08:47.891
But you're not describing us
at all.

1:08:48.057 --> 1:08:50.026
Shel attended UC Santa Cruz.

1:08:50.126 --> 1:08:52.061
I got my postdoc in Israel.

1:08:52.229 --> 1:08:54.798
We're not the best,
we're merely the most

1:08:54.931 --> 1:08:57.934
willing to work like dogs
for ludicrously low pay.

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:00.737
Time is running out,
Jeff, you gotta get off

1:09:00.904 --> 1:09:02.972
your high horse and hire
whoever the hell you can get.

1:09:03.106 --> 1:09:05.475
So, basically
any capable human being?

1:09:07.277 --> 1:09:09.246
All right.
I'll put MacKenzie on it,

1:09:09.413 --> 1:09:11.248
but we gotta figure out where
we're gonna put these people.

1:09:11.415 --> 1:09:13.817
That brings us
to the second thing

1:09:13.950 --> 1:09:15.585
we wanted to talk to you about.

1:09:15.752 --> 1:09:17.954
I mean, look around,
Jeff, come on.

1:09:19.088 --> 1:09:20.924
We could move
those file cabinets

1:09:21.090 --> 1:09:23.593
and squeeze in a couple
of desks over there.

1:09:24.928 --> 1:09:27.964
How are we gonna buy desks?
We've got no money.

1:09:28.097 --> 1:09:30.667
-Jeff!
-Fine.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:32.936
We'll figure something out.
All right?

1:09:33.437 --> 1:09:34.938
Maybe I'll use a door.

1:09:42.479 --> 1:09:45.349
Niko! How are you? It's Jeff.

1:09:46.250 --> 1:09:51.321
We're in Seattle
working on a new startup.

1:09:51.988 --> 1:09:53.490
You wanna come over?

1:09:55.625 --> 1:09:57.026
The pay's shit.

1:09:59.496 --> 1:10:02.098
Sure, it probably
pays more than that.

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.436
All right.
I'll send you some information.

1:10:07.704 --> 1:10:09.138
Bye.

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:19.716
Hello? Arthur!

1:10:19.849 --> 1:10:21.685
It's good to hear from you.

1:10:22.286 --> 1:10:23.520
How's the business coming?

1:10:25.855 --> 1:10:28.658
Yeah.
That's what I like to hear.

1:10:28.825 --> 1:10:31.160
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure today?

1:10:34.664 --> 1:10:39.869
Yeah, yeah, I've heard of it,
the so-called online bookstore.

1:10:44.974 --> 1:10:46.209
Really?

1:10:47.344 --> 1:10:50.914
Yeah, uh-- I-- Thanks, Arthur,
I appreciate you telling me.

1:10:51.047 --> 1:10:52.916
Oh, you better believe
I'm gonna take care of this.

1:10:53.049 --> 1:10:56.420
Yeah, thanks again.
Yeah, we'll talk soon.

1:10:59.556 --> 1:11:01.024
This is where
the magic happens.

1:11:09.032 --> 1:11:10.734
It's a dump.

1:11:10.867 --> 1:11:13.503
I know. Come on, that's
your desk right over there.

1:11:20.410 --> 1:11:22.045
Is this a door?

1:11:22.546 --> 1:11:23.947
It's the best desk
money can buy.

1:11:25.915 --> 1:11:27.617
Now, here's the rest
of the team.

1:11:27.751 --> 1:11:30.053
Shel, Paul, MacKenzie you know.

1:11:30.219 --> 1:11:31.888
Of course.
Hey, MacKenzie.

1:11:32.055 --> 1:11:35.058
So, you've got your computer,
your full setup there.

1:11:35.559 --> 1:11:37.561
-Hey, Jeff.
-Slight problem.

1:11:37.694 --> 1:11:39.095
How slight?

1:11:39.228 --> 1:11:40.964
One that threatens
our very existence.

1:11:41.097 --> 1:11:42.566
British drôlerie there?

1:11:42.732 --> 1:11:44.968
No, deadly serious,
I'm afraid.

1:11:45.769 --> 1:11:47.737
I went to run a test
on the checkout

1:11:47.904 --> 1:11:49.906
to see if we could order
an actual book

1:11:50.073 --> 1:11:52.141
and, to my horror,
the distributor requires

1:11:52.275 --> 1:11:54.444
a 10-book minimum order
on all retailers.

1:11:54.578 --> 1:11:55.912
What?

1:11:56.079 --> 1:11:58.415
Ten books per order,
no exceptions.

1:11:58.582 --> 1:11:59.883
That makes no sense.

1:11:59.983 --> 1:12:02.151
I know. I told them that.

1:12:02.285 --> 1:12:03.920
But seeing as they're
the largest distributor

1:12:04.087 --> 1:12:05.922
with five million titles
and I'm a nobody,

1:12:06.089 --> 1:12:07.757
they weren't really
interested in my opinion.

1:12:07.924 --> 1:12:10.093
It's just how they've always
done business.

1:12:10.259 --> 1:12:11.961
Let's try a different
distributor.

1:12:12.095 --> 1:12:13.997
The only other
distributor that matters

1:12:14.130 --> 1:12:15.765
has the identical policy.

1:12:15.932 --> 1:12:18.835
I humbled myself,
begged them to let our poor,

1:12:18.968 --> 1:12:21.270
fledgling company order
less than a minimum

1:12:21.438 --> 1:12:23.673
and they told me
to go fuck myself.

1:12:24.441 --> 1:12:27.477
Not in those words exactly,
but pretty close.

1:12:28.978 --> 1:12:30.447
So, what's the bottom line?

1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:32.649
For every one book we order,

1:12:32.782 --> 1:12:34.350
we're gonna have to pay
for ten.

1:12:34.484 --> 1:12:36.119
We're gonna burn
through our cash reserves

1:12:36.252 --> 1:12:38.187
in less than three months.

1:12:38.788 --> 1:12:40.657
And then we'll be swimming
in inventory

1:12:40.790 --> 1:12:42.626
we don't even need
with no place to put it.

1:12:53.336 --> 1:12:55.138
How does the payment work?

1:12:56.806 --> 1:12:59.008
Do they charge you
when you order the book?

1:13:00.477 --> 1:13:01.878
Or when they ship it?

1:13:02.646 --> 1:13:04.147
Or when we actually get it?

1:13:04.313 --> 1:13:06.616
-When the books arrive.
-You're sure?

1:13:06.716 --> 1:13:08.117
Yeah.

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:09.953
So, if we order ten books,

1:13:10.053 --> 1:13:11.655
but only seven arrive--

1:13:11.821 --> 1:13:13.389
We're only billed
for the seven.

1:13:13.523 --> 1:13:15.324
-Niko!
-Yeah.

1:13:15.492 --> 1:13:16.893
You were a biology teacher.

1:13:17.026 --> 1:13:18.995
-Yeah.
-I need you to find me

1:13:19.162 --> 1:13:21.030
the most obscure science
book out there.

1:13:21.164 --> 1:13:23.132
Something that is impossible
to find.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.347
Here's a hot title.

1:13:38.515 --> 1:13:41.217
The Lichen-Flora of Chicago
and Vicinity

1:13:41.350 --> 1:13:43.386
by William Wirt Calkins.

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:48.892
Carver Press. 1896.
Definitely out of print.

1:13:49.025 --> 1:13:50.760
Perfect.

1:13:50.894 --> 1:13:52.862
Now, what's the name
of the new Grisham book?

1:13:52.996 --> 1:13:54.698
The Rainmaker.

1:13:54.864 --> 1:13:56.700
Let's go ahead and order
one copy of The Rainmaker,

1:13:57.534 --> 1:14:00.870
nine copies
of Niko's science book.

1:14:02.038 --> 1:14:04.107
And the distributor
should only charge us

1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:05.942
for the one copy
of The Rainmaker.

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:08.778
Yeah. And if any of the back
ordered books arrive,

1:14:08.912 --> 1:14:10.213
we'll just return them.

1:14:11.214 --> 1:14:12.616
Now what?

1:14:12.749 --> 1:14:14.250
We wait, I suppose.

1:14:14.718 --> 1:14:17.721
No. Full speed ahead.

1:14:17.887 --> 1:14:19.355
Even if it's off a cliff?

1:14:19.455 --> 1:14:22.626
We've done worse. Let's go!

1:14:22.759 --> 1:14:26.129
-Full steam.

1:14:26.262 --> 1:14:27.764
Hello?

1:14:29.432 --> 1:14:30.734
Yeah, this is him.

1:14:36.072 --> 1:14:38.908
I'm available.
Tomorrow?

1:14:42.111 --> 1:14:44.447
I'll be there. Thank you.

1:14:50.219 --> 1:14:51.988
That was Leonard Riggio
of Barnes & Noble.

1:14:52.121 --> 1:14:53.489
What did he want?

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:54.991
He wants to meet tomorrow.

1:14:55.792 --> 1:14:58.061
Something about
a business opportunity.

1:14:58.562 --> 1:15:00.096
Well, that's good.

1:15:01.097 --> 1:15:04.668
Yeah. That's good.

1:15:38.467 --> 1:15:41.470
-Jeff?
-Oh. Mr. Riggio.

1:15:42.839 --> 1:15:44.540
-Pleasure.
-Good to see you.

1:15:46.776 --> 1:15:48.678
What would you like
to talk about?

1:15:48.812 --> 1:15:51.848
An old friend
gave me a call the other day.

1:15:53.016 --> 1:15:54.684
Told me about you, actually.

1:15:55.284 --> 1:15:57.186
Seems you didn't take my advice

1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:00.624
and you're still going around
trying to get investments.

1:16:01.124 --> 1:16:02.659
Can you blame me?

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:07.063
See, it's not that you're
pursuing this silly little idea

1:16:07.196 --> 1:16:09.332
that bothers me,
it's the fact that apparently

1:16:09.498 --> 1:16:10.734
you still are referring to it

1:16:10.867 --> 1:16:12.168
as the world's
biggest bookstore.

1:16:13.670 --> 1:16:15.204
I don't see a problem with it.

1:16:15.338 --> 1:16:17.206
You-- You don't see
why that offends me?

1:16:18.007 --> 1:16:19.909
-No.
-Well, then, I'll tell you.

1:16:21.678 --> 1:16:23.579
How old are you Jeff?
What, about 35?

1:16:23.713 --> 1:16:25.248
Thirty-one.

1:16:25.381 --> 1:16:28.384
When you were a one-year-old,

1:16:28.517 --> 1:16:32.856
I opened a little shop called,
uh, Student Book Exchange.

1:16:33.522 --> 1:16:35.692
I was just a kid
at the time at NYU,

1:16:35.825 --> 1:16:39.362
but it turned into be
a major retailer.

1:16:39.528 --> 1:16:41.264
Coast to coast.

1:16:41.397 --> 1:16:43.532
Well, I mean, that's amazing.

1:16:43.667 --> 1:16:46.235
You should just listen,
you might learn something.

1:16:47.370 --> 1:16:49.205
So, a little bit later,

1:16:49.338 --> 1:16:50.907
it was when you were
about seven years old,

1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:54.043
I acquired a little shop
called Barnes & Noble,

1:16:54.210 --> 1:16:56.245
and I liked its name,
so I used it

1:16:56.379 --> 1:16:58.214
after I picked up
a few hundred more shops.

1:16:59.215 --> 1:17:02.051
But Wall Street said,
"Well, there's no more room,

1:17:02.218 --> 1:17:04.420
my friend, to grow
in the book industry,"

1:17:04.553 --> 1:17:09.225
and I said, "Fuck you.
I'm just getting started."

1:17:10.259 --> 1:17:12.595
And that's when I invented
the superstore.

1:17:13.229 --> 1:17:16.966
So, you don't understand
why you calling yourself

1:17:17.100 --> 1:17:18.902
the world's biggest
bookstore offends me?

1:17:19.602 --> 1:17:22.305
Well, it's because
it's a goddamn lie.

1:17:22.438 --> 1:17:25.441
We hold that title and will
for many more years to come.

1:17:25.975 --> 1:17:27.744
And if we ever lose it,

1:17:27.911 --> 1:17:32.716
it'll be to Crown or,
I don't know, Kmart or Borders.

1:17:34.083 --> 1:17:36.585
Not to some dope who's
working out of a shit hole,

1:17:36.753 --> 1:17:39.723
who hasn't sold one
single book in his entire life.

1:17:39.823 --> 1:17:41.057
I understand.

1:17:41.157 --> 1:17:44.227
Yeah, I'm pretty articulate.

1:17:45.929 --> 1:17:48.564
You see, it's not meant to be
taken literally.

1:17:49.265 --> 1:17:51.234
It's just a way
for our customers to understand

1:17:51.334 --> 1:17:54.003
the vast extent and potential
of the Internet.

1:17:54.137 --> 1:17:56.172
See, I don't care
what your intentions are,

1:17:56.305 --> 1:17:58.274
just stop saying it.

1:17:59.275 --> 1:18:01.945
You don't
and I'll sue your ass.

1:18:02.645 --> 1:18:05.081
But not right now, no.

1:18:05.181 --> 1:18:07.316
Not even after you've actually
sold a few thousand books.

1:18:07.450 --> 1:18:09.652
I'm gonna wait
for just the right time,

1:18:09.786 --> 1:18:11.120
like the week
that you go public.

1:18:11.755 --> 1:18:13.790
And then you'll be dead
in the crib.

1:18:14.490 --> 1:18:17.961
Or I can make you
a proposal right now

1:18:18.127 --> 1:18:21.030
so we can bury this idea five
feet, under where it belongs.

1:18:22.631 --> 1:18:25.501
Barnes & Noble is willing
to acquire this idea

1:18:25.634 --> 1:18:28.337
from you for the gracious
sum of $1 million.

1:18:29.505 --> 1:18:31.808
I mean, God knows that's
more than what it's worth.

1:18:32.275 --> 1:18:34.210
But, you know,
it should be enough for you

1:18:34.343 --> 1:18:35.812
to cover and recoup
your losses,

1:18:35.945 --> 1:18:37.513
pay whoever you owe,

1:18:37.646 --> 1:18:40.817
and bother someone
other than myself.

1:18:42.118 --> 1:18:43.486
You're naive.

1:18:44.988 --> 1:18:48.657
Frankly,
insults me to a degree,

1:18:48.825 --> 1:18:54.730
but you have ambition that
reminds me of my younger self.

1:18:55.664 --> 1:18:57.666
I, too, had dreams
of being a conqueror,

1:18:57.834 --> 1:19:02.738
but you would be a fool
not to take this offer.

1:19:07.676 --> 1:19:09.012
See,
you have one thing wrong.

1:19:10.914 --> 1:19:12.415
I'm not a conqueror.

1:19:14.017 --> 1:19:15.518
I'm an explorer.

1:19:15.684 --> 1:19:17.386
What's the difference?

1:19:19.188 --> 1:19:20.756
It pays to explore.

1:19:23.226 --> 1:19:25.829
You remember that time
at that bar in Miami?

1:19:27.230 --> 1:19:28.764
I was so excited.

1:19:28.898 --> 1:19:31.700
I'm meeting Leonard Riggio,
the legend,

1:19:31.868 --> 1:19:35.704
CEO of Barnes & Noble,
and inviting him

1:19:35.872 --> 1:19:39.375
on this journey with me
to invest in amazon.com.

1:19:40.877 --> 1:19:42.678
And when you walked out
on that meeting,

1:19:42.778 --> 1:19:44.547
I realized something.

1:19:47.450 --> 1:19:51.387
You're the past
and I'm the future.

1:19:52.721 --> 1:19:55.624
And one day, your stores
will start to close,

1:19:55.758 --> 1:19:57.593
just like all those
independent bookstores

1:19:57.726 --> 1:19:59.896
you proudly
put out of business.

1:20:00.629 --> 1:20:03.566
And your empire
will begin to crumble

1:20:04.133 --> 1:20:06.936
the day that my website
goes live.

1:20:28.958 --> 1:20:31.460
Jeff? How'd it go?

1:20:31.594 --> 1:20:33.162
-Good.

1:20:33.296 --> 1:20:35.098
He offered to buy us out.

1:20:35.764 --> 1:20:37.266
-What?
-How much?

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:38.767
A million.

1:20:41.637 --> 1:20:43.439
Yes!

1:20:45.141 --> 1:20:47.110
You said yes, right?

1:20:47.610 --> 1:20:49.312
I told him to go fuck himself.

1:20:49.445 --> 1:20:51.114
Are you bloody mad?

1:20:53.749 --> 1:20:56.986
You see, he's willing
to pay us a million dollars

1:20:57.120 --> 1:20:59.956
before we're even live.
Doesn't that tell you anything?

1:21:00.123 --> 1:21:03.126
He's scared. He's scared
of what we're gonna become.

1:21:03.292 --> 1:21:05.161
Jeff, be sensible.

1:21:05.294 --> 1:21:07.663
We don't have any cash,
we don't have any investors.

1:21:07.796 --> 1:21:09.698
At this rate, we're never
gonna get off the ground.

1:21:09.832 --> 1:21:11.500
Why are you challenging me
about this?

1:21:11.634 --> 1:21:13.669
I'm not challenging you.

1:21:13.802 --> 1:21:15.804
Listen, do I need to go
under this table,

1:21:15.972 --> 1:21:17.706
get the certificate
that says I'm the CEO

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.775
of this company
to tell you to trust me?

1:21:20.643 --> 1:21:22.011
Honey...

1:21:22.645 --> 1:21:26.182
Anyways, after what I told him,
that deal's gone.

1:21:26.315 --> 1:21:28.184
But I do have good news.

1:21:28.317 --> 1:21:31.687
What good news could you
possibly give us after this?

1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:33.122
Our name.

1:21:34.323 --> 1:21:35.824
Come on. Get close.

1:21:35.992 --> 1:21:37.660
Come on! Drumroll, please.

1:21:47.503 --> 1:21:50.073
Whoa!

1:21:51.507 --> 1:21:52.908
I like that!

1:21:53.042 --> 1:21:55.744
Amazon.com!

1:21:55.878 --> 1:21:57.981
Named after the world's
largest river!

1:21:58.081 --> 1:22:00.984
Actually, five times bigger
than the second largest river.

1:22:01.084 --> 1:22:02.918
Bet he tells us
what it is.

1:22:03.052 --> 1:22:04.820
The Congo, of course.

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:06.922
Amazon.com is a name
we'll never need to change.

1:22:07.056 --> 1:22:11.094
It tells everybody that we are
the world's biggest bookstore.

1:22:11.227 --> 1:22:13.529
And it starts with an A,
just for you.

1:22:16.432 --> 1:22:22.405
-Yeah.
-Um, is it Amazon.com

1:22:23.072 --> 1:22:26.042
or without and just Amazon?

1:22:26.209 --> 1:22:29.378
It's Amazon.com. The dot com
is-- is to be included

1:22:29.545 --> 1:22:31.080
in every instance.

1:22:31.214 --> 1:22:34.950
One more question. Um, why?

1:22:35.851 --> 1:22:37.786
See,
the dot com tells our customers

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:41.557
that we exist exclusively
on the internet.

1:22:41.690 --> 1:22:44.227
That's true of a lot of places.

1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:46.629
No one else uses the dot com.

1:22:47.563 --> 1:22:49.798
But we will be the first.

1:22:52.435 --> 1:22:54.903
All right. Niko, you still
got those friends in New York?

1:22:55.071 --> 1:22:56.905
Sure, I know some guys.

1:22:57.040 --> 1:22:58.307
Well, we need to raise
some money fast.

1:22:58.441 --> 1:22:59.908
Let's get some new investors.

1:23:00.043 --> 1:23:01.410
Shel, let's pull up
that homepage.

1:23:01.577 --> 1:23:02.911
Come on, let's get to work.

1:23:07.250 --> 1:23:10.086
Now, see where it says
"World's Biggest Bookstore?"

1:23:10.719 --> 1:23:12.255
Cut it.

1:23:12.421 --> 1:23:14.490
Now, scroll
all the way to the top.

1:23:16.092 --> 1:23:19.595
Right there. On the top.

1:23:23.999 --> 1:23:25.301
Bolder.

1:23:26.102 --> 1:23:28.971
Bolder. Perfect.

1:24:02.538 --> 1:24:04.440
Yeah.

1:24:23.126 --> 1:24:25.861
-It worked!

1:24:25.994 --> 1:24:28.997
-Whoo!
-Nice.

1:24:29.132 --> 1:24:31.334
-Oh, wow.

1:24:32.668 --> 1:24:34.570
Because it's an online model,

1:24:34.703 --> 1:24:37.005
we believe we can have
significant cost advantages

1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:38.874
and undercut our competitors.

1:24:39.007 --> 1:24:40.676
And what's to stop them
both from opening

1:24:40.809 --> 1:24:42.578
their own online stores?

1:24:42.711 --> 1:24:44.847
Well, they likely will.
Um, but they're doomed to fail.

1:24:44.980 --> 1:24:46.515
Because they're probably
gonna be competing

1:24:46.649 --> 1:24:48.217
with themselves
in that scenario, right?

1:24:48.351 --> 1:24:50.353
Exactly.
Their physical locations.

1:24:50.486 --> 1:24:52.020
And to compete,
they're gonna have to close

1:24:52.155 --> 1:24:53.722
those physical locations,

1:24:53.856 --> 1:24:55.591
and I doubt
they're gonna do that.

1:24:55.724 --> 1:24:57.426
And if they do,
it's not gonna be anytime soon.

1:24:57.560 --> 1:24:59.528
By then, Amazon will have
the market share

1:24:59.695 --> 1:25:01.264
and it'll be too late.

1:25:01.397 --> 1:25:04.032
Exactly. We believe that
we will probably lose money

1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:06.369
for up to 20 years.

1:25:06.502 --> 1:25:09.538
Uh, but at Amazon.com,
we're focused on the long-term.

1:25:09.672 --> 1:25:12.241
Uh, not short-term
profitability.

1:25:12.375 --> 1:25:15.077
Um, because we don't charge
our customers sales tax,

1:25:15.211 --> 1:25:18.714
uh, we believe we can continue
to gain market share,

1:25:18.847 --> 1:25:20.616
um, without profitability.

1:25:20.749 --> 1:25:23.719
You're talking about
monopolizing the market here.

1:25:23.886 --> 1:25:25.888
You really want to get
into that, Mr. Bezos?

1:25:26.054 --> 1:25:29.225
Monopolizing is-- is a very,
uh, harsh word.

1:25:29.392 --> 1:25:31.527
Um, it's more survival
of the fittest.

1:25:31.627 --> 1:25:33.596
Um, the smaller companies
will fail.

1:25:33.729 --> 1:25:35.864
Obviously,
in order for us to succeed,

1:25:35.964 --> 1:25:37.933
we need to continuously
be raising capital,

1:25:38.066 --> 1:25:41.437
and, um, this company will
require significant amounts

1:25:41.570 --> 1:25:43.639
of capital if we're gonna
build the infrastructure

1:25:43.772 --> 1:25:45.140
and the system
to have higher revenue

1:25:45.274 --> 1:25:46.809
and higher profitability
down the road.

1:25:46.942 --> 1:25:48.977
But you have
so many big box stores.

1:25:49.111 --> 1:25:50.713
They're not gonna let you
get away with this.

1:25:50.813 --> 1:25:52.781
Well, physical locations
are paying up

1:25:52.915 --> 1:25:55.251
to $10 a square foot
when we pay pennies

1:25:55.418 --> 1:25:56.819
a square foot
for our warehouses

1:25:56.952 --> 1:25:58.554
that can be located
just outside

1:25:58.654 --> 1:26:00.389
of big metropolitan areas.

1:26:00.489 --> 1:26:02.591
Uh, we only have a small
facility right now in Seattle,

1:26:02.758 --> 1:26:05.794
but we believe expanding
those facilities nationwide

1:26:05.928 --> 1:26:08.096
will get the product
to our customers quicker

1:26:08.264 --> 1:26:11.267
and allow us to maintain
that lower cost structure.

1:26:11.434 --> 1:26:13.636
To me,
if I'm hearing you correctly,

1:26:13.769 --> 1:26:15.604
you're open 24 hours,

1:26:15.771 --> 1:26:18.173
it's faster and easier
to buy books,

1:26:18.307 --> 1:26:20.243
it's cheaper
'cause of sales tax,

1:26:20.343 --> 1:26:22.345
and it's cheaper
for you to deliver that

1:26:22.478 --> 1:26:24.680
'cause you don't have the cost
of brick and mortar.

1:26:24.813 --> 1:26:26.315
Does it end with books,

1:26:26.449 --> 1:26:28.183
or would there be
an opportunity to sell

1:26:28.317 --> 1:26:30.185
other products and services
to this customer base?

1:26:30.319 --> 1:26:33.121
Other categories that we look
to expand into are music

1:26:33.289 --> 1:26:36.459
and, um, other
vast library categories.

1:26:45.968 --> 1:26:49.305
I mean that was the greatest
performance ever.

1:26:49.438 --> 1:26:51.340
-Thanks!
-And it means a lot, like,

1:26:51.474 --> 1:26:53.509
when you said
full steam ahead, like this--

1:26:53.642 --> 1:26:55.344
But what about
small businesses?

1:26:55.478 --> 1:26:57.813
-What about 'em?
-They're honest people.

1:26:57.946 --> 1:26:59.682
We're a small business,

1:26:59.815 --> 1:27:01.149
we should be helping
each other out.

1:27:01.284 --> 1:27:02.985
We won't be for long.

1:27:03.118 --> 1:27:05.821
If this is gonna work,
we have to continue to scale.

1:27:09.525 --> 1:27:11.660
-All right, team.

1:27:13.296 --> 1:27:17.333
So, as you all know,
beta testing begins today.

1:27:17.833 --> 1:27:20.168
We've assembled a list of
several hundred of our friends

1:27:20.336 --> 1:27:22.338
and family
that will be receiving a link

1:27:22.471 --> 1:27:25.374
to a test site where
they can place test orders.

1:27:25.508 --> 1:27:27.343
Of course,
they could place a real order,

1:27:27.476 --> 1:27:28.644
but there's a chance that

1:27:28.744 --> 1:27:30.145
there'll still be some
glitches.

1:27:30.245 --> 1:27:33.649
Now, there's a lot
of work to be done

1:27:33.749 --> 1:27:39.555
before the whole site goes live
in July, but there's a saying.

1:27:39.688 --> 1:27:41.557
You can work long,
you can work hard,

1:27:41.690 --> 1:27:43.191
and you can work smart,

1:27:43.359 --> 1:27:44.760
but you can only
pick two of them.

1:27:45.361 --> 1:27:48.831
At Amazon.com, we need
all three every single day.

1:27:48.931 --> 1:27:52.267
If we're gonna make Amazon.com
the world's greatest website,

1:27:52.401 --> 1:27:55.070
it begins with all
of our hard work.

1:27:55.203 --> 1:27:56.605
So, let's go.

1:28:17.393 --> 1:28:19.061
Ready?

1:28:26.068 --> 1:28:28.971
-We're live.

1:28:52.395 --> 1:28:54.329
I'm going to get
something to eat.

1:28:55.631 --> 1:28:56.999
Care to join me?

1:28:59.101 --> 1:29:00.836
-I'm gonna hang back.
-All right.

1:29:01.570 --> 1:29:03.672
-Niko?
-Yeah, I could eat.

1:29:04.473 --> 1:29:07.175
-Jeff?
-I'm good, thank you.

1:29:07.309 --> 1:29:10.446
-All right.

1:29:24.427 --> 1:29:25.994
Jeff, can I talk to you
for a second?

1:29:26.128 --> 1:29:27.463
Sure.

1:29:29.632 --> 1:29:31.634
So, I guess because
we're on the home stretch now,

1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:33.368
I've been thinking.

1:29:33.502 --> 1:29:35.370
I look at everything
I've given to this company

1:29:35.504 --> 1:29:38.140
and quite frankly,
I put everything I had into it.

1:29:38.306 --> 1:29:40.008
Paul has, too.

1:29:40.142 --> 1:29:41.710
I mean, we built the damn site.

1:29:41.844 --> 1:29:43.311
The site is everything,
you know that.

1:29:43.979 --> 1:29:45.548
You guys are rock stars,
I know.

1:29:47.215 --> 1:29:49.117
So, I guess
what I'm wondering is,

1:29:49.217 --> 1:29:51.987
why aren't we founders
along with you and MacKenzie?

1:29:52.154 --> 1:29:54.457
Why aren't we receiving
founder's shares?

1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:58.961
'Cause you never asked.

1:30:02.330 --> 1:30:04.567
You remember that time
we got together for coffee?

1:30:04.700 --> 1:30:06.569
Came up with the terms
of your agreement,

1:30:06.702 --> 1:30:09.638
wrote up the contract,
which you signed.

1:30:11.006 --> 1:30:16.011
Now, whatever the difference
is from what you did receive

1:30:17.345 --> 1:30:20.683
to what you believe you're due
should be a lesson to you.

1:30:21.383 --> 1:30:24.419
Know your worth, Shel.

1:30:27.556 --> 1:30:29.658
When we had first met
in that coffee shop,

1:30:29.758 --> 1:30:31.259
I knew my worth.

1:30:32.027 --> 1:30:34.162
I knew my worth so much,
I was willing to follow

1:30:34.262 --> 1:30:36.699
this dream of yours
to revolutionize commerce.

1:30:38.066 --> 1:30:39.902
I know you wanna
change the world,

1:30:40.035 --> 1:30:42.070
Jeff, but what're you trying
to change it to?

1:30:42.871 --> 1:30:44.740
Huh. To think
I figured you out.

1:30:52.581 --> 1:30:54.216
I just want to make history.

1:31:38.260 --> 1:31:40.963
Hey. I'm going to bed.
You should, too.

1:31:41.096 --> 1:31:45.067
-I should, too.
-No, but really. You should.

1:31:46.602 --> 1:31:48.303
It's the weekend.

1:31:48.436 --> 1:31:50.405
The test is running smoothly,
and there's no reason

1:31:50.505 --> 1:31:52.507
why you can't get a good
night's sleep with your wife.

1:31:54.610 --> 1:31:56.111
While you're at it,

1:31:56.278 --> 1:31:57.780
why don't you send
Paul and Shel home, too.

1:31:57.946 --> 1:31:59.615
You're right.

1:32:00.282 --> 1:32:02.017
Don't sound too excited.

1:32:03.786 --> 1:32:08.090
I just feel like watching
my toddler learn how to walk.

1:32:09.792 --> 1:32:11.459
If I don't pay attention...

1:32:11.627 --> 1:32:14.162
It's gonna crack its head open
on a chrome coffee table?

1:32:14.630 --> 1:32:16.164
Exactly.

1:32:18.366 --> 1:32:20.002
That's a feeling
I wouldn't trust.

1:32:20.636 --> 1:32:22.004
It's just a test.

1:32:22.871 --> 1:32:24.339
None of this matters yet,

1:32:24.472 --> 1:32:26.308
it's gonna be a few weeks
before any orders

1:32:26.474 --> 1:32:28.711
even maybe come in,
you know--

1:32:35.884 --> 1:32:37.720
Is that what I think it is?

1:32:38.186 --> 1:32:40.656
Fluid Concepts
and Creative Analogies.

1:32:42.490 --> 1:32:43.692
Paid with a credit card.

1:32:44.359 --> 1:32:45.861
We got our first order.
