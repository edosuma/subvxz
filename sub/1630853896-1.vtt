Blankets.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.858
-Good morning, girls!
-Hi, Mrs. Coletti.

05:23.891 --> 05:27.494
Come to do a little shopping
at Sharon's Vineyard?

05:27.929 --> 05:29.831
Yes. And as I told you,

05:29.864 --> 05:32.066
that joke's only funny
if your name's Martha.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.367
Well, I think it works.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.604
Take whatever you like.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.606
Thank you. Love you.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.608
I could have actually
done this shopping.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.442
It is your bachelorette party.

05:42.677 --> 05:45.513
But when I put you
in charge of my 21st,

05:45.546 --> 05:46.747
we ended up with a tableful

05:46.781 --> 05:47.882
of different flavors
of schnapps.

05:48.149 --> 05:51.384
Whatever. That was
a super fun spread!

05:54.454 --> 05:55.556
Okay.

05:56.891 --> 05:58.993
-What's wrong?
-Oh, nothing.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.129
Just posting for socks,
because that's what I do.

06:03.998 --> 06:06.601
Had a very enlightening
conversation this morning

06:06.634 --> 06:09.804
with my agent, who informed me,
in no uncertain terms,

06:09.837 --> 06:12.106
that I am essentially
no longer a writer.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.608
So, you know.

06:14.407 --> 06:18.179
Instagram doesn't define you.
Instagram just pays the bills.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.047
-Okay?
-Ugh! I know. I know.

06:20.248 --> 06:23.050
I-- I just need to write a book.
Another book.

06:23.084 --> 06:24.785
-I'm gonna write another one.
-You should.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.021
Mama, we're leaving.

06:27.288 --> 06:30.658
Have fun, girls.
Enjoy the house.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.961
You have no idea
how many yarn stores

06:33.995 --> 06:37.198
I had to take Betty to
for her to let you gals use it.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.633
Yarn stores?

06:38.666 --> 06:40.601
So, see you back here Sunday
for the shower.

06:40.635 --> 06:42.169
- Thanks, Mrs. C.
- Indeed.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.905
Mack,

06:43.938 --> 06:45.940
-get that hair out of your face.
-Ooh.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.711
How does she do that?

06:50.978 --> 06:52.046
This...

06:54.048 --> 06:55.983
This.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.451

06:58.485 --> 07:02.089

07:02.123 --> 07:03.224

07:03.257 --> 07:04.692

07:04.725 --> 07:06.661

07:06.694 --> 07:08.763
Hi, buddy. Yes, come.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.098
Yes. Hello. Oh, whoops.

07:11.132 --> 07:13.634
Oh, Cheese-- Cheesy!

07:13.668 --> 07:15.569
God, I am so sorry. I'll, um--

07:15.603 --> 07:16.804
-It's--
-Ugh!

07:17.138 --> 07:19.573
I'm so sorry.
I promise I'll replace them.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.908
No! You-- you... you can't.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.944
They're limited editions.

07:22.977 --> 07:24.612
Oh.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.080
Yeah, and I've already
worn them twice,

07:26.113 --> 07:27.815
so, really, what am I
gonna get out of them

07:27.848 --> 07:29.650
-at this point, right?
-Well, again,

07:29.684 --> 07:32.687
so sorry about that.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.224
So, um, anyway, each day's food
is in these little baggies,

07:37.258 --> 07:39.660
so half in the morning,
then half at night.

07:40.094 --> 07:41.228
Every day and night.

07:41.796 --> 07:44.065
Yeah. Uh, I'll be able
to figure out how to--

07:44.098 --> 07:46.968
- how to feed the dog.
- Right. Cool.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.739
Wow, crazy plans this weekend?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.007
Uh, yeah!

07:53.040 --> 07:54.809
It's my best friend's
bachelorette

07:54.842 --> 07:57.979
in Palm Springs.
I mean, it's gonna be wild.

07:58.012 --> 07:59.814
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.550
Uh, well, if you're looking
for something

08:02.583 --> 08:04.885
a little more low-key,
I like to every now and again,

08:04.919 --> 08:06.687
just go for a rip
around the neighborhood

08:06.721 --> 08:07.888
on my longboard,

08:08.189 --> 08:10.191
and if you wanted, maybe,
you could come with, some time.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.194
Maybe.

08:14.929 --> 08:15.997
Whelp!

08:16.464 --> 08:17.932
I think that's everything.

08:18.132 --> 08:20.668
-Great.
-Thank you, Jack.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.170

08:23.671 --> 08:24.939
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.400
Let's see.

11:08.836 --> 11:12.206
There she is.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.046
Mack, where
the freak are you?

11:19.079 --> 11:21.015
-We're at the bar already.
-Uh, nothing. Nowhere.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.217
Okay, well, get your
cutie little booty tooty

11:23.250 --> 11:24.752
out to the bar.
We're doing shots!

11:24.785 --> 11:26.754
Yeah. I feel like if
I got my tonsils out,

11:26.787 --> 11:28.722
I would just, like,
want to put them in a jar.

11:28.756 --> 11:29.757
Ready?

11:30.024 --> 11:31.825
Yeah, me, too.

11:31.859 --> 11:32.860
Oh.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.395
- No.
- You--

11:36.030 --> 11:37.464
Okay. So, um...
...just so you're aware,

11:37.498 --> 11:39.133
it is our best bebe's
bachelorette bridal brunch,

11:39.333 --> 11:40.334
and you best come correct.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.870
And, at the moment,
you're very incorrect.

11:43.804 --> 11:47.408
Oh. Well, I'm not ready-ready.

11:47.441 --> 11:49.777
You know, I wa-- I was saying,
are you guys ready?

11:49.810 --> 11:50.844
I would say one, two, three,

11:50.878 --> 11:51.879
-yeah, we're ready.
-No problem.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.414
- Okay.
- Okay. Great.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.849
Just go get something
out of my suitcase.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.018
Okay.

11:58.052 --> 11:59.820

Why aren't we over there?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.188
-Where?
-There.

12:34.656 --> 12:36.490
I mean, look at them.
They've got it figured out,

12:36.524 --> 12:38.859
those women. You know,
just eating toast

12:38.892 --> 12:40.160
and laughing.

12:40.528 --> 12:42.363
I wanna be like them.

12:42.664 --> 12:47.001
Just sitting around
and falling asleep

12:47.034 --> 12:48.969
till someone comes
and shakes me awake and tells me

12:49.003 --> 12:50.505
it's time to go to sleep
somewhere else.

12:50.538 --> 12:52.139
We need to know.
We need to know.

12:52.574 --> 12:55.309
But we are gonna do
what you want.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.544
Whatever you want.

12:57.111 --> 12:59.947
I am, uh, really excited
for this weekend!

13:02.883 --> 13:04.351
Carla, you're up.
Party of four?

13:04.385 --> 13:06.086
Oh, Carla. That's me.
I mean, no. It's not me.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.589
- It's us. I mean her.
- She's getting married!

13:11.225 --> 13:13.093

<i>Blow up the bass ♪</i>

13:45.259 --> 13:47.394
What? No. Okay, the physical
therapist is not overrated.

13:47.428 --> 13:49.129
When you have sex
with your physical therapist--

13:49.163 --> 13:51.265
okay, so he's not my
all the time, he was my sub.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.866
Okay. He was just,
like, your substitute--

13:52.900 --> 13:54.468
Babe, I told you,
wear the green ones.

13:54.502 --> 13:56.437
These are not for the desert.

13:58.472 --> 14:01.375
You guys, is anyone else,
you know, feeling like...

14:03.077 --> 14:06.046
-...anxious from this heat?
-No. I actually love it.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.915
-Oh, shit.
-I feel like it's life-giving.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.083
- You guys.
- Life-- What?

14:09.116 --> 14:10.384
Bad Bunny is playing
a private show

14:10.417 --> 14:12.486
in a walk-in refrigerator
behind Ralph's.

14:12.687 --> 14:14.021
Starts in an hour.

14:14.054 --> 14:18.192
Wait. Can... we... ra-lly?

14:18.225 --> 14:22.429
Yes, we ca-a-a-n!

14:22.463 --> 14:24.365
- Meh.
- Bah!

14:24.632 --> 14:25.600
-What was that?
-What?

14:25.633 --> 14:26.900
What was that

14:27.301 --> 14:28.536
sound that you made with,
like, your face and your mouth?

14:28.570 --> 14:30.237
Oh, no. I mean, I'm kidding.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.206
- Okay.
- Obviously. I just-- no!

14:32.239 --> 14:36.243
I thought it would be super fun,
uh, if we all, um...

14:38.946 --> 14:40.347
take a break.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.216
And lie down.

14:42.617 --> 14:47.020
and, uh, did a-- did a...
a past life regression!

14:47.054 --> 14:48.389
- What?
- Yeah.

14:48.422 --> 14:50.525
It could be, like,
a bachelorette activity.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.393
Mm-hmm.
I've done one of these before.

14:52.426 --> 14:54.194
Honestly, truly life-changing.

14:54.228 --> 14:55.530
Saw a lot, but--

14:56.063 --> 14:57.632
Bad Bunny in a refrigerator.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.536
No, it's just, it's crazy.
You know, I was--

15:01.569 --> 15:04.004
I was just thinking of
pitching a piece

15:04.037 --> 15:05.239
on past-life regressions,

15:05.272 --> 15:07.675
and-- and there's a sign
for one right there,

15:07.709 --> 15:12.179
and-- and it kind of feels
like, well, a sign.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.347
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.617
You should go do it.

15:16.283 --> 15:20.020
I know this isn't your thing.
It's all good. I love you.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.424
- Thank you.
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.

15:23.457 --> 15:25.159
We'll just meet
back up at the house.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.360
-Okay.
-Okay?

15:26.393 --> 15:27.629
Have fun.

15:27.662 --> 15:30.063
Regress and be blessed.
Regress and be blessed.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.233
Regress.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.072
Why can't I enjoy a stupid show

15:39.106 --> 15:41.175
in a refrigerator
like everyone else?

15:41.709 --> 15:44.278
I mean, I would lie down
in a refrigerator.

15:45.713 --> 15:47.014
Hello?

15:53.588 --> 15:57.191
Uh, okay. Did I just step
through the looking glass?

15:57.391 --> 15:58.459
What is this?

15:59.059 --> 16:01.395
Uh, hello?

16:03.230 --> 16:04.331
Is anyone here?

16:05.399 --> 16:06.366
Hello?

16:09.571 --> 16:12.406
Welcome. Mm.

16:12.874 --> 16:18.713
Hi. I'm, uh-- oh,
I'm here to, um, regress.

16:18.746 --> 16:21.716
Oh, lovely.
Do you have an appointment?

16:21.749 --> 16:24.251
-I don't, no, but--
-Oh, no! Uh. Wait, wait, wait.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.286
Please, please don't touch,
it-- this is very expensive

16:26.320 --> 16:27.689
equipment from Europe,
thank you.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.456
Right, but the sign said

16:29.490 --> 16:31.325
-lie flat.
-Yeah, you will, you will.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.595
Just let me check the schedule,
okay? We're very busy.

16:33.628 --> 16:35.597
Om!

16:36.163 --> 16:39.233
Om-- oh!

16:40.367 --> 16:42.637
Today is your lucky day,
Moonchild.

16:42.937 --> 16:45.439
Mercury must be in Gatorade.
I'm normally swamped,

16:45.472 --> 16:47.642
but something
just popped open for you, so--

16:47.675 --> 16:50.210
-So, I can just lie flat?
-Yeah. Yes.

16:50.244 --> 16:51.513
-Okay. Here.
-Oh, ah, but I request

16:51.546 --> 16:53.213
that you pay before
undergoing the regression.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.449
Uh, after visiting
your other lives,

16:55.482 --> 16:57.685
you may feel disoriented.

16:57.719 --> 17:00.588
I take PayPal, cash,
Visa, MasterCard.

17:00.622 --> 17:02.289
Thank you. Let's get you in.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.758
No, I really just need
to lie down, so--

17:03.791 --> 17:05.425
Oh, please, please.
Lay down, Moonchild.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.194
Yes, there you go.

17:07.494 --> 17:10.230
-Oh, yes. Oh, gosh!
-Ah, yes.

17:10.264 --> 17:11.766
- Slide in there. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.635
All right, Moonchild.

17:13.668 --> 17:16.236
Okay, Moonman.

17:16.804 --> 17:21.241
Take a deep breath,
relax, and breathe.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.112
Okay, once you are relaxed,

17:25.145 --> 17:27.414
I want you to think
about who you are,

17:27.749 --> 17:30.484
who you were,
and who you want to be.

17:30.919 --> 17:34.154
Today's intention is to connect
with the person you once were.

17:34.589 --> 17:36.558
Life can take you
on a winding path

17:36.591 --> 17:38.292
that often moves
in both directions.

17:38.626 --> 17:42.329
It's important to remember
that time is merely a construct.

17:42.597 --> 17:45.633
Who you are, who you were,
who you want to be.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.669
It's all within
you at this very moment.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.169
You know what? I-- I--

17:49.202 --> 17:52.807
I, uh--
I don't need the whole spiel.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.275
If you could just let me
lay here, that would be great.

17:55.309 --> 17:57.411
Okay, uh, uh,
who do you want to be?

17:57.444 --> 17:59.814
-What?
-Who do you want to be?

17:59.847 --> 18:03.250
Who do I want to be?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.553
I want to be
a person who doesn't, you know,

18:05.587 --> 18:08.656
feel like they have to do
every little thing right.

18:08.856 --> 18:11.291
You know, I want to be able
to lay down whenever I want to,

18:11.325 --> 18:14.596
not have to wear
these tall, tall boots

18:14.629 --> 18:16.731
and walk around
like I'm a giraffe.

18:16.764 --> 18:19.601
And I don't want to have
to put a filter on every photo

18:19.634 --> 18:22.570
to be deemed attractive
by everyone I meet.

18:22.604 --> 18:23.838
And I... I...
I don't want to have

18:23.871 --> 18:25.405
to pretend I like kombucha.

18:25.439 --> 18:27.307
I don't. It's disgusting!

18:27.341 --> 18:29.744
And I want to be able
to sit anywhere I want to,

18:29.777 --> 18:31.345
lay anywhere I want to,

18:31.378 --> 18:32.647
and I just want
to stay home, like,

18:32.847 --> 18:34.247
and not be judged

18:34.281 --> 18:35.415
for being a hermit.

18:35.783 --> 18:39.186
I just want to be my Grammie.
I want to be Grammie Martin.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.488
I want to be free
to say whatever I want.

18:41.689 --> 18:43.190
I-- I wanna be the women

18:43.223 --> 18:45.560
at the Pancake House
eating pancakes!

18:45.593 --> 18:46.561
Who are you?

18:46.761 --> 18:48.295
I don't know! I don't know.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.631
I just...

18:49.664 --> 18:52.466
Who are you deep inside
your core? Who are you?

18:52.667 --> 18:56.403
I'm-- I'm a 70-year-old woman,

18:56.436 --> 18:59.239
trapped in the body of
a 30-year-old

18:59.272 --> 19:02.877
who really just needs
a minute to rest!

19:05.013 --> 19:09.717
Hello? Hello?

19:11.284 --> 19:14.321
Okay.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.356
Oh. Oh.

19:20.561 --> 19:21.562
Ooh.

19:23.665 --> 19:24.565
Ah.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.570
Oh, dear. Ow! Oh.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.340
Oh. Mm-hmm.

19:37.512 --> 19:39.446
What's that guy's name again?

19:39.479 --> 19:42.416
Luca? Oh, my God!

19:42.684 --> 19:45.485
Oh! Oh, my God! No, no. Wait.

19:45.820 --> 19:48.823
What is this?
This is--

19:48.856 --> 19:52.459
Oh, my God, no.

19:52.694 --> 19:55.429
Oh. Oh, my God. No.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.766
No, no.
Where is that guy? Luca!

19:58.800 --> 20:00.400
Get in here, fix this!

20:00.768 --> 20:03.470
Luca! Luca!

20:03.671 --> 20:05.873
Luca! Will somebody help me?

20:05.907 --> 20:08.776
This is not me!
I'm not-- Where am I?

20:09.043 --> 20:14.716
Luca!
I'm not me. I'm not me.

20:15.049 --> 20:19.921
I'm old. I'm really not okay.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

20:26.928 --> 20:29.831
Oh, dear.

20:38.606 --> 20:41.542
Oh, these stupid boots.

20:41.843 --> 20:43.778
Oh, ow.

20:50.518 --> 20:54.622
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Please.

20:56.624 --> 20:59.292
Ah! Oh! No! Come on.

20:59.927 --> 21:03.497
Oh, no.

21:05.032 --> 21:06.567
Oh, my God.

21:12.807 --> 21:13.775
What?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.487
You can't be here.
I'm very sorry.

21:27.522 --> 21:28.823
If you're on meth,
we don't have any.

21:29.023 --> 21:30.625
What? No, no.

21:30.658 --> 21:32.994
I'm not on meth, Carla. It's me.

21:33.194 --> 21:35.062
- Ma'am, I'm serious.
- 'Okay, please.

21:35.096 --> 21:36.396
Listen. Listen.

21:36.597 --> 21:38.566
One more move and you get
an eyeful of pepper.

21:38.766 --> 21:42.369
-It stings. Trust me.
-That is empty.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.370
No, it's not.

21:43.571 --> 21:45.006
Oh, I know that's empty,

21:45.039 --> 21:47.407
because you've had it
since college.

21:47.909 --> 21:48.943
How you know that?

21:49.342 --> 21:52.547
Because we bought
those pepper sprays together

21:53.014 --> 21:54.916
and we tested them out
on each other,

21:55.116 --> 21:56.851
just to make sure
that they worked. And--

21:56.884 --> 21:58.119
No, no, but I'm serious!

21:58.152 --> 22:01.055
You're a ghost.
Please, ghost. Go away, ghost!

22:01.088 --> 22:03.925
-Carla!
-Go away. Go away, ghost.

22:03.958 --> 22:05.960
-Carla!
-Go away, ghost.

22:05.993 --> 22:08.763
Carla, I'm not a ghost.

22:08.796 --> 22:11.666
It's me! Mack!

22:11.699 --> 22:13.568
-What?
-I don't know what to do.

22:13.601 --> 22:16.003
Something really crazy happened
to me in that regression pod,

22:16.037 --> 22:17.638
and I don't even look
like me anymore.

22:17.672 --> 22:20.473
But I'm me, okay? The--
Well, look, look. See? See.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.643
That's Mack's jewelry.
What did you do with her?

22:22.677 --> 22:25.478
What do you mean?
You gave me this bracelet.

22:25.513 --> 22:27.982
Because you said
all my other jewelry

22:28.015 --> 22:31.152
looked like I bought
it at a Judge Judy estate sale.

22:31.185 --> 22:33.486
Which I said is
a good thing because--

22:33.988 --> 22:36.123
Judge Judy rich as hell.

22:36.157 --> 22:38.159
What the hell?!

22:38.192 --> 22:40.460
I don't know
what happened to me.

22:40.828 --> 22:42.697
You're my best friend.

22:43.164 --> 22:45.766
-I love you so much.
-Okay, okay, okay.

22:45.800 --> 22:46.834
I love you, too.

22:46.868 --> 22:48.102
- Carla?
- Carla?

22:48.135 --> 22:49.537
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!

22:49.570 --> 22:50.771
Then I heard "ghost,"
and then I...

22:52.073 --> 22:53.774
Oh, my God!

22:55.977 --> 22:57.678
Are you okay?
'Cause we heard screams.

22:57.712 --> 22:58.980
-I heard you literally scream.
-Yeah,

22:59.013 --> 23:00.514
just one of Betty's friends.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.786
Hey.

23:06.621 --> 23:09.056
I'll meet you guys there.
I wanna change. I feel like--

23:09.090 --> 23:10.558
-Sure, yeah.
-Definitely change, for sure.

23:10.591 --> 23:12.526
-Yeah. You guys look hot.
-Thank you so much.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.661
-Thanks. You can too.
-You can, too.

23:13.694 --> 23:14.695
I'm trying try to get laid.

23:14.729 --> 23:16.063
-Okay. Thank you.
-Ooh, yeah!

23:16.264 --> 23:18.966
- Nice meeting the-- you.
- Okay, just get us enough seats.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.668
Okay, I want to make sure
they're not waiting.

23:20.701 --> 23:22.469
Okay. I need a drink.

23:22.503 --> 23:25.039
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

23:26.707 --> 23:29.877
This like-- it's like I'm me,
but I'm not me.

23:29.911 --> 23:32.813
I mean, I'm me way up here.
But these things here,

23:32.847 --> 23:34.815
like, I had them.
They're not mine.

23:34.849 --> 23:38.853
Mine were like normal size.
Ah, this is horrible.

23:38.886 --> 23:41.088
Okay, so what were
you thinking about

23:41.122 --> 23:43.824
when he was asking you
who you wanted to be?

23:43.858 --> 23:46.594
Well, I was thinking
about Grammie Martin,

23:46.794 --> 23:50.463
and about how sick
of all the bullshit I am. And--

23:50.497 --> 23:52.633
Okay, so you were thinking
about old lady stuff

23:52.667 --> 23:54.535
- and then you turned into one.
- Uh-huh.

23:54.568 --> 23:56.537
So, he should be able
to turn you back into you.

23:56.837 --> 23:59.140
Oh, God, this is really
a nightmare.

23:59.173 --> 24:03.077
My hair is different.
It's, like, really weird.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.145
Look at this.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.847
It feels like it's well-coated
wire or something.

24:06.881 --> 24:08.516
It's not hair.

24:08.549 --> 24:10.785
Mack, we're going to fix this.

24:10.818 --> 24:12.053
I'm just really tired

24:12.086 --> 24:13.788
and overwhelmed,
and I need to rest.

24:13.821 --> 24:15.623
I just don't know how
to explain this to you.

24:15.656 --> 24:19.226
But you know what I can feel?
I can, like, feel the bones.

24:19.260 --> 24:20.594
We're gonna figure this out.

24:20.628 --> 24:22.196
Yeah. And if we don't, you know,

24:22.229 --> 24:24.497
I'll just lose my friends
and my sponsors,

24:24.532 --> 24:25.900
- and I'll just run outta money.
- No.

24:25.933 --> 24:27.868
And I'll be one of those
old people, you know,

24:27.902 --> 24:30.204
that dies in their apartment
and turns into flesh soup

24:30.404 --> 24:32.206
because nobody finds
them for weeks.

24:32.239 --> 24:34.675
Okay, I'm not gonna
let you turn into flesh soup.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.844
-Really?
-Really.

24:37.745 --> 24:39.647
I'm gonna call my mom,

24:39.680 --> 24:42.750
and ask her if we can use
Betty's house another few days.

24:42.783 --> 24:45.186
But wait a minute. Whoa!
What about your shower?

24:45.219 --> 24:47.288
I'll cancel it.
This is a little more important.

24:47.321 --> 24:50.124
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
No, you're not going to cancel

24:50.157 --> 24:52.126
anything at all.

24:52.159 --> 24:54.128
I got an idea.
Here's what we're gonna do.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.564
You're gonna drive
the girls back to LA,

24:56.597 --> 24:58.132
and you just tell them that,
I don't know,

24:58.165 --> 24:59.800
some sort of
a work thing came up.

25:00.034 --> 25:01.802
Anyway, I will go back
into town,

25:01.836 --> 25:03.637
and I will see
if I can find him,

25:03.671 --> 25:06.540
and I'll be back in LA
in time for your shower.

25:06.574 --> 25:08.242
You don't want me
to come with you?

25:09.844 --> 25:10.878
No.

25:11.579 --> 25:14.015
I just think I need
to be alone right now.

25:14.715 --> 25:18.119
This is-- Whoo--
a lot to process.

25:18.152 --> 25:20.554
And you're sure
there's nothing I can do?

25:21.022 --> 25:23.791
Could you drive me somewhere
to rent a car?

25:25.026 --> 25:26.627
-I have a better idea.
-Hmm?

25:26.660 --> 25:29.030
Get some rest tonight.
I got you.

25:30.698 --> 25:33.200
All right.
You look amazing.

25:33.234 --> 25:36.837
I do not. Oh, dear.

25:38.205 --> 25:40.041
Okay, I'll see you
at the shower.

25:40.274 --> 25:43.210
- Yeah, wish me luck.
- You got this.

25:43.244 --> 25:44.845
Okay.

25:44.879 --> 25:46.180
- Love you.
- Love you.

25:48.716 --> 25:52.987
No! Where did he go?

25:58.325 --> 26:02.096
Where did he go?

26:10.871 --> 26:13.874

Maybe this is just--
I don't know, what is this,

26:18.145 --> 26:19.914
some sort of a dream?
Just a real, like,

26:19.947 --> 26:21.382
terrible dream.

26:21.415 --> 26:23.384
Yeah, well,
but still, nevertheless.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.753
Let's just wake up, okay?

26:26.454 --> 26:30.691

27:04.925 --> 27:06.927
Uh, can I help you?

27:07.596 --> 27:11.098
Well, hello.
There you go. I'm...

27:12.700 --> 27:14.268
I'm really not, um--

27:14.301 --> 27:16.036
Uh, you know,
I'm not Mack's mom.

27:16.437 --> 27:18.772
I'm Mack's, a-- actually
I'm Mack's aunt.

27:19.106 --> 27:21.408
And it's her Aunt Rita.
Is that...

27:21.442 --> 27:23.310
She didn't tell you, though,
about me because,

27:23.344 --> 27:24.778
she-- she knows I'm her aunt.

27:24.812 --> 27:27.047
Anyway, so what
we're doing is...

27:27.081 --> 27:29.083
...uh, an--
an apartment swap.

27:29.283 --> 27:32.052
And Mack is using my house
as a writer's retreat,

27:32.086 --> 27:35.156
in Scottsdale or--
Yeah, Scottsdale it is.

27:35.189 --> 27:37.424
- Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.093
I didn't know
she was writing again.

27:39.126 --> 27:40.728
I-- I really liked
her first book.

27:41.462 --> 27:42.997
-You did?
-Yeah.

27:44.331 --> 27:47.935
She'd be really flattered
if she knew.

27:47.968 --> 27:49.803
But anyway, who cares,
right? And--

27:49.837 --> 27:52.106
So, uh, how long
are you here for?

27:52.306 --> 27:53.374
Me? Oh.

27:54.408 --> 27:56.177
It's like
I'm not really--

27:56.210 --> 27:58.379
I don't know.
Right now, I'm not quite sure.

27:58.412 --> 28:00.314
But you know,
it'll-- it'll be a while, maybe.

28:00.347 --> 28:01.749
Okay, well.

28:01.782 --> 28:03.083
- Uh, I'm Jack.
- Hey.

28:03.117 --> 28:04.485
Welcome to the building.

28:04.519 --> 28:06.921
Uh, I usually take care
of Cheese

28:06.954 --> 28:08.289
when Mack's out of town.

28:08.322 --> 28:10.357
Oh, sorry. He's usually
a little cuter than this.

28:10.391 --> 28:12.159
No, he's very cute,

28:12.193 --> 28:13.460
but at some--

28:13.494 --> 28:15.696
I don't know why.
Doesn't seem to like me.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.132
Maybe it's just because
"Rita and Cheese"

28:18.165 --> 28:20.267
doesn't have the same ring
to it as "Mack and Cheese."

28:20.301 --> 28:22.303
- "Mack and Cheese."
- Right? It's "Mack and Cheese."

28:22.336 --> 28:23.404
That's pretty funny.

28:23.672 --> 28:26.740
That is-- It's so stupid.
But it is, it's funny.

28:26.774 --> 28:29.310
Okay, I don't know.
I think it's pretty cute.

28:29.343 --> 28:31.011
- Yes.
- Yeah.

28:31.045 --> 28:34.748
So, uh, Mack, s-- she didn't,
uh, mention me?

28:34.949 --> 28:37.117
She did not mention
a dog walker. No.

28:37.151 --> 28:39.753
Oh, oh, okay.
Well, I'm-- I mean, I'm also,

28:39.787 --> 28:41.288
-like, a pretty good guy. Yeah.
-And you...

28:41.322 --> 28:45.092
- And modest, huh?
- Yeah. Well, nice to meet you.

28:45.292 --> 28:46.860
Uh, again, I--
I'm just next door

28:46.894 --> 28:47.928

28:48.195 --> 28:49.930

or-- or whatever.

28:49.964 --> 28:51.398
-Oh.
-I'm Jack.

28:51.432 --> 28:53.234
-You're Jack. Good boy.
-Later, Cheese.

28:53.267 --> 28:55.936
Thank you, by the way.
Got it, and I won't.

28:55.970 --> 28:58.172

-Hey.

- Hey, Betty.
- Angela.

31:02.463 --> 31:04.198
- Fabulous. All of it.
- Oh, oh.

31:04.231 --> 31:06.400
Doesn't she look so cute?
And that's my mom, Sharon.

- She does.
- Oh, nice to meet you, Rita.

31:09.571 --> 31:10.605
Where's Mack?

31:10.839 --> 31:13.474
She's doing the writing retreat
in Scottsdale.

31:13.508 --> 31:15.109
-We talk-- I told you.
-Oh. Mm-hmm.

31:15.142 --> 31:17.144
Oh, odd timing.

31:17.177 --> 31:19.046
But I'm glad
she's writing again.

31:19.079 --> 31:20.548
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes. Thank you.

31:20.582 --> 31:23.183
Auntie Rita. Can I talk
to you for a second?

31:23.217 --> 31:25.520
-I want to show you something.
-Of course.

31:25.553 --> 31:27.354
I wanna just--
I wanna show her something.

31:27.388 --> 31:29.691
-Yes. Show me.
-We'll be right back.

31:29.724 --> 31:32.594
We'll be here.
Oh, I love that outfit...

he was never even there.

We're-- We're gonna find him.
We're gonna--

31:38.600 --> 31:40.067
In all truth, you should
be focusing

31:40.100 --> 31:41.135
on your wedding, Carla.

31:41.168 --> 31:42.604
Please, girl.

31:42.637 --> 31:44.572
Like she's gonna let me do
anything I want wedding-wise.

31:44.773 --> 31:46.340
And this is for me.

31:46.373 --> 31:48.142
How are we supposed to grow old
on the French Riviera

31:48.175 --> 31:49.611
if you're 50 years ahead of me?

31:49.644 --> 31:52.212
Ladies, can you come over
and sit down?

31:52.246 --> 31:54.314
We've already started
opening the presents.

31:54.616 --> 31:55.683
I did it. I--

31:55.884 --> 31:58.152
- I don't like to wait.
- Oh.

32:02.222 --> 32:04.191
Sorry about this.
Betty's in a race.

32:04.224 --> 32:05.660
She's so old
that every second counts.

32:05.693 --> 32:07.194
Oh. What do you
have there, Betty?

32:07.227 --> 32:08.495
What-- what do we have there?

32:08.730 --> 32:11.666
Wait till you see.

32:11.699 --> 32:13.967
So, Rita, what would
you like to drink?

32:14.001 --> 32:16.437
Wine? Would
you like red or white?

32:16.470 --> 32:20.575
-Oh, red wine with ice cubes.
-Oh, great answer.

32:20.608 --> 32:25.245
You know, I love a woman
who knows what she likes.

32:25.279 --> 32:26.648
A woman

32:26.681 --> 32:28.015
who knows what she likes.

32:28.282 --> 32:30.984
So, how often, I'm just curious,

32:31.018 --> 32:33.487
do you ladies meet
for your wine club?

32:33.521 --> 32:34.622
Every day.

32:34.656 --> 32:36.323
-Oh, at least.
-And, uh, nights, too.

32:36.356 --> 32:37.525
-Oh.
-A lot.

32:37.559 --> 32:39.126
Sometimes we spend the weekend.

32:40.461 --> 32:42.129
Oh, here you go.

32:42.162 --> 32:43.531
-Oh. Thank you.
-Oh, there you go.

32:43.565 --> 32:45.265
So, if you're gonna
be in town for a while,

32:45.299 --> 32:46.333
you really should join us.

32:46.701 --> 32:49.069
I mean, we really need
someone to help us get through

32:49.102 --> 32:52.607
the garishly large wine cellar
my ex-wife left me,

32:52.640 --> 32:54.208
you know, before she died.

32:54.241 --> 32:56.343
Don't call Mama Tina
your ex-wife.

32:56.376 --> 32:58.613
Well, you told me not
to call her my dead wife.

32:58.813 --> 33:01.448
And don't call her Mama Tina.

33:01.482 --> 33:05.085
Make me sound like I was married
to a spaghetti sauce legacy.

33:08.088 --> 33:10.558
Let the girl call her Mama Tina.

33:10.792 --> 33:13.427
-No, she will not.
-Oh.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.663
See, Rita.
This is my house, my rules.

33:15.697 --> 33:18.031
I say what I want,
and I do what I want.

33:18.232 --> 33:20.602
And people that don't like it,
they know where the door is.

33:21.235 --> 33:22.704
I've got a door
back there, too.

33:22.737 --> 33:24.506
Please, please, God.

33:24.539 --> 33:26.608
Okay. What do you
have there, Betty?

33:26.641 --> 33:28.375
-Carla.
-I'm getting another one.

33:28.408 --> 33:29.811
Carla, I'm gonna keep this one.

33:29.844 --> 33:32.346
It belongs on your side table.

33:33.146 --> 33:35.182
Okay, who is this from?

33:35.215 --> 33:36.651
Wow, I love the wrapping.

33:54.468 --> 33:55.670
There's nothing there.

33:55.904 --> 33:57.505
No, there's nothing there.

33:57.539 --> 34:00.073
Look and see.
You would agree with me.

34:04.679 --> 34:05.713
Damn thing.

34:06.648 --> 34:08.148
We gonna do this.

34:08.850 --> 34:12.587
I need you
to have positive thought.

34:12.620 --> 34:15.455
You're gonna visualize
your boobs are higher,

34:15.489 --> 34:19.092
your hair is softer.
You don't use the word "rest."

34:19.126 --> 34:20.595
Carla, you gotta
get me out of this thing.

-Mm-hmm. You did Pilates?

39:31.939 --> 39:33.507
Yeah. Well, I was doing
this thing

39:33.541 --> 39:35.943
where I was trying to encourage
my mom to stay active.

39:35.977 --> 39:38.145
So, I told her that
I would go with her, um,

39:38.179 --> 39:40.147
but then she bailed and I just

39:40.181 --> 39:41.716
-ended up going all by myself...
-Mm-hmm.

39:41.749 --> 39:42.817
...for an entire year,

39:42.850 --> 39:44.018
because I bought her
an annual pass

39:44.051 --> 39:45.519

39:45.820 --> 39:47.454

39:47.487 --> 39:49.790

40:00.768 --> 40:03.037
No, I mean, let's face it. I am.

40:03.237 --> 40:06.507
I mean, it's not an insult.
It's just where I'm at. I'm old.

40:06.540 --> 40:09.577

to head up to the roof

of those mid-month mixers.

-No.

-and, you know--
-Uh, yes, that is accurate.

40:24.491 --> 40:25.993

to clown on,

40:26.027 --> 40:27.862

like, half the fun of it.

the electrical infrastructure

to like it, so I stopped.

41:31.792 --> 41:34.762
And as a result,
I hang out by myself a lot.

41:34.795 --> 41:36.097
-Yeah.
-Uh, but it's okay.

41:36.130 --> 41:38.032
I-- I like hanging out
by myself.

41:38.498 --> 41:40.835
I'm just curious. How does that
go into a relationship?

41:40.868 --> 41:43.070
- Not ever good.
- No, I mean--

41:44.672 --> 41:45.673
But no, I feel like--

41:45.973 --> 41:47.174
I feel like you understand
that, though, right?

41:47.208 --> 41:48.843
Well, you know, obviously,

41:48.876 --> 41:51.579
I'm a woman of a certain age.
Have you noticed?

41:53.914 --> 41:56.650
You know, who's had a full
spectrum of life experiences,

41:56.917 --> 41:58.986
and just a few relationships.

41:59.186 --> 42:03.190
-Right. Well, to not pretending.
-Yeah. Oh, hey, cheers.

42:05.793 --> 42:07.028
Oh!

42:07.061 --> 42:08.229
Wow. Wow. Wow.

42:08.462 --> 42:10.097
No, no. That's not okay.

42:10.131 --> 42:11.599
- Yeah.
- No, no.

42:11.632 --> 42:13.768
I'm so sorry.
That's mortifying to me.

42:13.968 --> 42:15.236
I'm gonna go get
some more shrimp.

42:15.269 --> 42:16.771
- More shrimp.
- Shrimp.

42:16.804 --> 42:18.172
More shrimp will
solve that problem.

42:18.205 --> 42:20.608
You bet. Jumbo shrimp
solves everything.

42:20.641 --> 42:22.877
-Okay.
-Oh, well. Uh. More shrimp.

42:22.910 --> 42:24.211
-Yeah, yeah.
-More shrimp.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.655
Can I say thanks
for the invite, Sharon?

42:34.688 --> 42:35.990
This is so nice.

42:36.023 --> 42:37.591
-Oh, please.
-Oh, this is...

42:37.925 --> 42:40.161
No need to coop yourself up
in Mack's little apartment

42:40.194 --> 42:42.129
all day, when you have us.

42:42.329 --> 42:44.231
And, honey, we can always
use some fresh blood

42:44.265 --> 42:45.366
-in this group.
-That's right.

42:46.734 --> 42:48.836
So, Rita. You got a man?

42:48.869 --> 42:49.970
-Oh.
-Huh?

42:50.004 --> 42:51.739
You'll have
to excuse Betty.

42:51.772 --> 42:53.007
She lost her filter.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.742
-Oh.
-I didn't lose anything.

42:54.775 --> 42:56.343
-Oh, yeah?
-I just prefer

42:56.377 --> 42:57.878
-to skip the small talk.
-That's right.

42:58.312 --> 43:00.848
So, you know,
Mack has this neighbor.

43:01.048 --> 43:02.116
-Oh.
-Now we're talking.

43:02.149 --> 43:03.918
Oh! What does he do?

43:03.951 --> 43:06.387
Well, I don't-- I don't know.
I-- I don't know much.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.888
I guess maybe real estate
or something,

43:07.922 --> 43:09.824
or maybe his parents
still pay for everything.

43:09.857 --> 43:12.326
-That's a little weird.
-Well, who cares what he does?

43:12.359 --> 43:14.161
It's not like
you're looking for somebody

43:14.195 --> 43:16.097
to spend the rest of
your life with, at this point.

43:16.130 --> 43:18.099
Well,
you certainly aren't.

43:18.132 --> 43:19.934
The rest of your life
could be the length

43:19.967 --> 43:21.168
of one episode of <i>Ellen.</i>

43:21.202 --> 43:22.837
That's so mean.

43:22.870 --> 43:25.005
-Mm!
-I am mean. I am. I am.

43:25.806 --> 43:26.974
-So, Rita?
-Huh?

43:27.007 --> 43:28.843
This-- this gentleman caller
of yours,

43:28.876 --> 43:30.177
um, is he good-looking?

43:33.180 --> 43:35.116
What do you--?
What do you mean? I mean--

43:35.149 --> 43:36.684
Oh-ho! Oh!

43:37.351 --> 43:38.886
Don't look at me like that.

43:38.919 --> 43:42.156
Oh, I know that look.
We got a handsome one, girl.

43:42.356 --> 43:44.091
Well, you know, he might--

43:44.125 --> 43:45.993
he might be a little,
like, too handsome.

43:46.026 --> 43:47.161
Oh, come on. Yeah.

43:47.194 --> 43:49.063
When has a man
ever been too handsome?

43:49.096 --> 43:50.698
I get it. I get it.

43:50.731 --> 43:53.400
Sometimes I wish that
Harold were less handsome,

43:53.602 --> 43:57.671
so I wouldn't have to keep
up the lie that I'm only 91.

43:57.705 --> 43:59.240
Well, this guy's young.

43:59.273 --> 44:00.774
He's young. He's young.

44:00.808 --> 44:02.176
-Oh, my.
-What are you talking, 60?

44:02.209 --> 44:03.711
Oh, my God.
I think he's younger.

44:03.744 --> 44:05.746
-Cougar.
-Stop! You gotta stop.

44:05.779 --> 44:08.682
I'm not gonna play this game.
I'm not interested in him.

44:08.716 --> 44:09.917
-Fifty?
-Fifty?

44:09.950 --> 44:11.051
Oh, come on.

44:11.085 --> 44:13.888
Come on. Go, go.
Go, go, go, go for it.

44:13.921 --> 44:17.057
The worst that can happen
is you wind up with herpes.

44:17.091 --> 44:18.893
-Ah! Oh, my God!
-Oh, Jesus!

44:18.926 --> 44:20.694
But once you move
into a retirement home,

44:20.728 --> 44:22.129
you're gonna get 'em anyway.

44:22.163 --> 44:24.698
You guys, you know what you are?
You're too much.

44:26.100 --> 44:29.770
Okay, I have
an eye doctor appointment.

44:29.803 --> 44:32.740
And, um, Rita,
would you mind giving me a ride?

44:32.973 --> 44:35.276
Yes, I would like to.

44:35.309 --> 44:37.144
-Okay.
-Oh, that's awful nice of you.

44:37.178 --> 44:38.445
Okay, I got it.

44:38.746 --> 44:40.080
-Okay.
-Okay.

44:40.281 --> 44:43.083
- Yeah, come back.
- Thank you. Oh, my God.

44:43.117 --> 44:44.952
-All right, here we go.
-Lock it up tight, girls.

44:44.985 --> 44:46.187
- Yeah. Bye.
- All right, we will.

44:46.787 --> 44:47.988
Phew.

44:48.022 --> 44:49.957
You know, we're not
going to my eye doctor.

44:49.990 --> 44:51.358
But wait a minute,
don't we have an appointment?

44:51.725 --> 44:54.028
Yeah, but what they
gonna do about it?

44:54.495 --> 44:59.033
Oh, God. You see, I love that.
I could never even do that.

44:59.066 --> 45:01.735
Yes, you could, Rita.
You could do it now.

45:01.769 --> 45:05.306
But first,
let's do what I want to do.

45:05.339 --> 45:07.942
But I thought I shouldn't do
what people tell me to do.

45:07.975 --> 45:10.244
I am an exception.

45:10.277 --> 45:12.880
- Uh-uh.
- Because I'm always right.

45:12.913 --> 45:14.181
Woo-hoo.

45:16.784 --> 45:18.085
Mack lives here?

45:18.319 --> 45:20.354
This is a raggedy-ass
neighborhood.

45:20.387 --> 45:22.423
Yeah, well, this is the--
the back of the building.

45:22.456 --> 45:25.125
Uh-huh. Well, okay.
Let's get these boxes.

45:25.159 --> 45:26.994
-Wait, what are you doing?
-Is that his window?

45:27.027 --> 45:28.362
-I thought-- What?
-Yes, but--

45:28.395 --> 45:30.331
All right, then we gotta
get it on, girl.

45:30.364 --> 45:32.299
No. Wait a second.
This is a bo-- don't do that.

45:32.333 --> 45:34.134
Just help me move this.
By myself.

45:34.168 --> 45:36.437
Sharon, I think this
is beyond the call of duty.

45:36.470 --> 45:37.539
Rita, Rita--

45:37.572 --> 45:39.240
Where am I supposed
to put it down?

45:39.273 --> 45:40.542
- Just put it over here.
- I'm doing what you--

45:40.575 --> 45:42.109
-What? Wait.
-Ooh, I messed up my nice bag!

45:42.142 --> 45:43.877
-We just have to get up.
-I don't know. No.

45:43.911 --> 45:45.312
No, no, no, no, no.

45:45.346 --> 45:47.081
Ooh, lord. I think I done
pulled my back out.

45:47.114 --> 45:48.215
No, don't pull your back out.

45:48.249 --> 45:49.250
- Let's get this.
- Okay.

45:49.283 --> 45:50.784
We're just gonna get up here.

45:50.818 --> 45:52.886
Rita, you need to see what
he's doing up in there.

45:53.087 --> 45:54.421
I'm gonna take a look.

45:54.455 --> 45:57.891
No, no, no. No, I'm not looking.

45:57.925 --> 46:02.196
- Typical. He's married.
- Sharon. What? He's married?

46:02.229 --> 46:03.831
Ah-ha! Ah-ha!

46:03.864 --> 46:06.000
I knew you were interested.

46:06.033 --> 46:08.369
- I told you.
- What? Let me see.

46:10.137 --> 46:12.306
-Oh, there he is. Look.
-Okay, that's it.

46:12.773 --> 46:14.174
Don't do that. Don't.

46:19.581 --> 46:21.815
-He's hung.
-Oh, no. Oh, no!

46:26.253 --> 46:29.089
Hey, Google, how do you say,

46:29.557 --> 46:33.027
"Roll over, Cheese" in Japanese?

46:33.060 --> 46:36.930
<i>In Japanese,</i>
<i>that's, "Chiizu, koro."</i>

46:36.964 --> 46:38.432
<i>What else should I translate?</i>

46:38.465 --> 46:40.901
I see what you mean when you
say he's just too good-looking.

46:40.934 --> 46:44.204
But if you ask me, I'd say
he's just good-looking enough!

46:44.238 --> 46:45.973
Okay, that is it.

46:46.206 --> 46:48.075
More than a couple
red flags there.

46:48.108 --> 46:51.345
And a-- a stupid skateboard?
I mean, that's immature.

46:51.378 --> 46:52.547
What? What about it?

46:52.580 --> 46:54.381
He tryin' to hold on
to his youth here,

46:54.415 --> 46:56.216
-just like we are.
-It's my-- Okay.

46:56.250 --> 46:58.085
And don't tell me that
you don't like what you see.

46:58.118 --> 46:59.219
What?

46:59.621 --> 47:03.223
Because he's one of the finest
50-year-old men I ever seen.

47:03.257 --> 47:04.892
Look at him.

47:06.126 --> 47:07.428
Stop it!

47:17.237 --> 47:19.607

50:47.815 --> 50:50.484
I'm glad they're dying for her,
and she's great. I admit it.

50:50.518 --> 50:52.319
But what--
what did you just say?

50:52.352 --> 50:55.757
Just post more of
that glamma, okay?

50:55.790 --> 50:58.793
<i>People are talking.</i>
<i>Buzz gets scuzz.</i>

50:59.027 --> 51:00.595
I made that up, scuzz is money,

51:00.628 --> 51:02.262
and I think
I made up glamma, too.

51:02.296 --> 51:03.565
<i>That's glamourous grandma.</i>

51:08.736 --> 51:09.837
Oh.

51:13.608 --> 51:15.108
- How?
- Huh?

51:15.309 --> 51:16.678
-How did you do this?
-Oh.

51:16.711 --> 51:19.179
What even is this place?

51:19.212 --> 51:20.715
They have five dresses,

51:20.748 --> 51:25.352
all cool, for my very
different bridesmaids.

51:25.687 --> 51:27.387
-Thank you.
-You know,

51:27.421 --> 51:28.590
I never told you this,

51:28.623 --> 51:31.391
but Grammie Martin
started taking me here

51:31.425 --> 51:33.427
when I was, like,
seven or something.

51:33.695 --> 51:35.195
-What? Really?
-Yeah.

51:35.228 --> 51:37.331
-Yeah, she did.
-You never told me that.

51:37.364 --> 51:39.399
I always thought you were
raiding Grandma's closet.

51:39.433 --> 51:43.805
No. No, I was just,
I-- I don't know.

51:43.838 --> 51:45.673
I just-- I was
kind of embarrassed

51:45.707 --> 51:47.609
to tell you about this place
because I thought maybe

51:47.642 --> 51:49.376
you'd think,
"Okay, it's dorky"

51:49.409 --> 51:50.712
or something like that.

51:50.745 --> 51:53.313
Since when do you care
about seeming cool to me?

51:53.514 --> 51:55.482
This place is
the opposite of dorky.

51:55.516 --> 51:57.652
-Look at all this stuff.
-Oh, I know.

51:59.419 --> 52:01.254
-Whoo.
-Just listen to me for a second.

52:01.288 --> 52:04.157
Just please don't tell anybody
about this place, okay,

52:04.191 --> 52:06.226
because I don't want some
lame-o coming in here

52:06.259 --> 52:08.362
and taking the good stuff.

52:08.395 --> 52:09.764
- My lips are sealed.
- Okay.

52:09.797 --> 52:10.832
Thank you, Macaroon.

52:11.198 --> 52:13.400
- Mack, I love you.
- Yeah.

52:13.433 --> 52:15.202
-My real wife.
-Yeah.

52:15.402 --> 52:18.271
My wife for life. Okay.

52:18.305 --> 52:19.439
-Oh. Oh, sure,
-Let's get the blue.

52:19.473 --> 52:21.475
-yeah. Okay.
-I don't know. I might be

52:21.509 --> 52:22.810
-a little... Mm.
-Hmm.

52:23.611 --> 52:24.679
Ooh.

52:25.913 --> 52:27.414
-Oh.
-Huh?

52:27.447 --> 52:29.182
We're not gonna
need the white suit.

52:29.984 --> 52:34.488
Well, we don't, but Aunt Rita.
Aunt Rita, she definitely does.

52:41.294 --> 52:43.531
Ah, I love the seashells.

52:43.998 --> 52:45.298
Oh, yeah?

52:45.700 --> 52:49.369
My grammie, she used to let
me take a seashell home

52:49.403 --> 52:52.774
every summer vacation.
Actually, you know what?

52:53.107 --> 52:54.742
It's not really silly.

52:55.677 --> 53:00.347
I loved trying to hear the ocean
inside them when we got home.

53:00.748 --> 53:02.650
Although, you know,
quite honestly,

53:02.684 --> 53:05.653
I don't think I could ever
really hear it. Could you?

53:06.219 --> 53:08.923
No, I can't.
Can't hear the ocean.

53:08.956 --> 53:11.926
I can definitely smell
the ocean, but can't hear it.

53:11.959 --> 53:13.427
I don't know
why people say that.

53:13.460 --> 53:14.662
Why do people always say that?

53:17.497 --> 53:19.834
Hey, so what
are you thinkin' for lunch?

53:24.271 --> 53:25.540
Oh.

53:26.007 --> 53:27.875
Wow. Looking good, Aunt Rita.

53:28.976 --> 53:30.477
Thank you very much.

53:30.511 --> 53:32.580
Now, listen, I know
exactly what we're gonna do.

53:37.317 --> 53:40.287
Oh, man, I could
really get used to this.

53:40.320 --> 53:43.423
I mean, I'm--
Retirement, I mean, of course.

53:43.457 --> 53:45.325
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too, in a way.

53:46.594 --> 53:49.262
I didn't even know
that you worked.

53:49.731 --> 53:51.699
What? What did you think that--

53:51.733 --> 53:53.868
that I was just sitting
around doing nothing all day?

53:55.803 --> 53:57.471
-Wait, what?
-No, I mean--

53:57.505 --> 53:58.873
Actually? I'll have you know

53:58.906 --> 54:01.408
that I'm a highly sought-after
private wealth manager.

54:01.441 --> 54:02.810
-Oh.
-Yeah.

54:02.844 --> 54:04.612
Wait, so you just thought
that I, like, did nothing?

54:04.812 --> 54:08.049
Well, I mean, you--
you never talk about it, ever.

54:08.082 --> 54:09.717
So, I mean,
what am I led to believe?

54:09.751 --> 54:11.251
Yeah, I mean, I guess, it--

54:11.786 --> 54:13.020
it-- it's kind of boring.

54:13.054 --> 54:15.690
You know?
And you are so not boring,

54:15.723 --> 54:18.960
so I didn't want to bore you
with how boring I am.

54:21.796 --> 54:22.997
-Are you folks ready to order?
-Oh.

54:23.463 --> 54:26.500
Oh, yeah. No, listen, I--
I need no time with the menu.

54:26.534 --> 54:30.037
Um, I just love this place
and I never even come here

54:30.071 --> 54:31.404
so I don't even
know why.

54:31.438 --> 54:32.372
Yeah, me, too!

54:33.373 --> 54:34.942
Okay, I know what I want.

54:34.976 --> 54:37.078
So, what I want is the garlic
cream fettuccine, please,

54:37.111 --> 54:38.613
and add bacon.

54:39.046 --> 54:41.348
Wow, I-- I did not realize
that I was dealing

54:41.381 --> 54:42.583
with a professional here.

54:42.784 --> 54:45.352
Uh, I'm gonna get the OG
barbecue chicken pizza, please.

54:45.620 --> 54:48.723
Fantastic. I'll have that
right out for you guys.

54:50.892 --> 54:52.026
Oh, damn it. Oh, shoot.

54:52.059 --> 54:53.628
- Wait a second.
- What?

54:53.661 --> 54:55.328
I forgot-- no,
never mind. It's nothing.

54:55.362 --> 54:56.731
What? No.
What is it? Just ask for it.

54:56.764 --> 54:58.398
No, no, no, no.
It's nothing.

55:01.468 --> 55:02.870
Look, here's the truth.

55:02.904 --> 55:07.008
The truth is the bacon needs
to be extra crispy-crispy.

55:07.474 --> 55:09.644
Yeah, wow. I could not
agree more with you on that.

55:09.677 --> 55:11.112
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna take
care of that right now.

55:11.145 --> 55:12.580
-No, you hang tight.
-Oh. Oh, no, sit--

55:12.613 --> 55:14.447
Let me see what kind
of magic I can do.

55:23.090 --> 55:24.391
Where are you?

55:24.592 --> 55:25.560
I'm at a lunch, Stephanie,

55:25.960 --> 55:27.929
and actually, I can't really
talk right now, okay?

55:27.962 --> 55:28.963
<i>Listen, I just wanted</i>

55:29.462 --> 55:31.666
to say that we're getting some
interesting offers for Rita.

55:31.699 --> 55:33.433
-Really?
<i>-They're mostly, like,</i>

55:33.466 --> 55:36.037
sensible adult
women's wear companies...

55:36.070 --> 55:37.370
-I mean--
<i>-...but they're offering</i>

55:37.404 --> 55:38.405
<i>real money.</i>

55:38.639 --> 55:39.907
She could really
make a lot of money, right?

55:39.941 --> 55:42.076
I mean, enough that
she could actually, like--

55:42.109 --> 55:45.613
Whatever! I don't need to hear
her whole life's journey, Mack.

55:45.646 --> 55:47.114
<i>Okay, just make sure</i>
<i>she posts more pictures.</i>

55:47.148 --> 55:49.584
- Okay.
<i>- And have her make</i>

55:49.617 --> 55:50.852
<i>her own account.</i>
<i>The woman is regal.</i>

55:50.885 --> 55:53.486
Hah! Regal!

55:54.922 --> 55:57.658
Wow.

56:02.462 --> 56:04.632
Hi, sorry to bother you.

56:04.665 --> 56:06.567
It's not a bother.
Not at all. No--

56:06.601 --> 56:07.969
Sorry. I was just sitting
over there,

56:08.002 --> 56:10.403
and you guys seem to be
having such a good time.

56:10.437 --> 56:11.906
You're obviously
very funny.

56:11.939 --> 56:14.876
Oh, I don't know about that.
I am? I don't--

56:15.209 --> 56:18.411
Your son must get it from you.
He seems so funny, too.

56:18.445 --> 56:22.482
I love funny. Is he single?
Is he? Is he single?

56:22.717 --> 56:23.951
No, no, no.

56:23.985 --> 56:27.054
You see, he's actually, he's--
he's not my son.

56:27.088 --> 56:30.457
Oh. O-- Oh!

56:30.490 --> 56:32.760
- Oh. Damn. Okay.
- Yeah.

56:32.793 --> 56:35.029
Damn. All right.

56:35.062 --> 56:36.130
- I see you.
- We're just--

56:36.396 --> 56:40.568
we're friends. We're
just friends. Just friends.

56:42.937 --> 56:45.139
Oh, whoa, whoa.

56:45.172 --> 56:46.707
Well, well, well.

56:46.741 --> 56:48.509
A magician at work.

56:48.709 --> 56:50.511
Per the gentleman's request.

56:50.544 --> 56:52.079
Oh, not bad, right?

56:52.113 --> 56:54.181
Yeah. Um...

56:54.215 --> 56:56.017
- Yeah.
- Quick problem,

56:56.050 --> 56:57.484
that-- that's mine.

56:57.518 --> 56:58.953
So, we should, yeah--
we'll just tradesies.

56:58.986 --> 57:00.955
Oh, oh. Of course. I mean,
I don't know what I'm thinking.

57:00.988 --> 57:02.056
Yeah.

57:02.323 --> 57:03.724
-Oh.
-Okay.

57:04.892 --> 57:07.028
-Whoo. Yeah.
-Here you go.

57:07.061 --> 57:08.162
Thanks again.

57:10.231 --> 57:11.599
Yeah.

57:12.499 --> 57:13.601
Bon appétit.

57:13.634 --> 57:15.069
-You gonna eat that bacon?
-Yeah, me?

57:15.102 --> 57:16.837
-Get a little bit of this--
-Yeah, dig in.

57:18.539 --> 57:19.439
Oh, my God.

57:19.941 --> 57:21.742
Oh, you have
to taste this, ladies.

57:21.776 --> 57:22.944
I made it myself.

57:24.245 --> 57:27.648
-Oh, did you rush?
-No, I took my time.

57:27.682 --> 57:28.983
No, no, I mean--

57:29.016 --> 57:30.184
I'm sorry. Your shirt.

57:30.217 --> 57:31.686
Oh.

57:31.719 --> 57:33.120
It's my granddaughter's.

57:33.154 --> 57:34.789
Oh, that's sweet.

57:34.822 --> 57:36.824
She didn't want it, and I never
say no to a free T-shirt.

57:37.158 --> 57:38.693
Hey, what is your
granddaughter's name?

57:39.527 --> 57:40.861
Cindy Carpenter.

57:41.062 --> 57:42.663
- Cindy Carpenter.
- Mm-hmm.

57:42.697 --> 57:44.131
- Uh-huh.
- What's she doin'?

57:44.398 --> 57:45.800
Boom.

57:45.833 --> 57:46.968
- See?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

57:47.001 --> 57:48.102
-That's it. That's it.
-Is it?

57:48.135 --> 57:49.537
-Yeah, that's right.
-Right?

57:49.570 --> 57:50.705
There she is, right there.

57:51.806 --> 57:53.140
-Let me see.
-All right.

57:53.174 --> 57:54.775
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, look.
-Oh.

57:54.809 --> 57:56.644
-Sweet face! Sweet.
-Yep.

57:56.677 --> 57:58.279
You know, while you guys
have been

57:58.312 --> 58:00.581
fooling around with your pocket
computer photo album--

58:00.614 --> 58:02.016
Mm-hmm.

58:02.049 --> 58:04.118
We could be deciding on
who's gonna go and get

58:04.151 --> 58:05.152
the next bottle of wine.

58:05.419 --> 58:07.955
You know, these pocket
computer photo albums

58:07.989 --> 58:09.890
are actually my job these days.

58:09.924 --> 58:12.226
-What?
-I get paid to post pictures.

58:12.259 --> 58:14.195
No. That's--
No, that's not a job.

58:14.228 --> 58:16.230
I mean, I-- I post pictures
of my grandbabies

58:16.263 --> 58:19.200
- all the time on my Instagram.
- All the time.

58:19.233 --> 58:21.969
I'm just saying
that nobody pays me.

58:23.771 --> 58:26.240
Well, you know, it's--
it's kind of a thing now.

58:26.273 --> 58:27.842
- Oh.
- Because sometimes

58:27.875 --> 58:30.611
a company will give you money
just to post a picture

58:30.644 --> 58:32.947
of yourself enjoying
the products.

58:32.980 --> 58:35.649
Oh, oh, is-- is that what, uh,
all those hearts are for?

58:35.850 --> 58:38.886
Uh, no, no.
Those are my likes. You see?

58:38.919 --> 58:41.722
-Oh, yeah, okay.
-Who are all these people?

58:41.756 --> 58:44.091
Yeah, well,
most of them are strangers.

58:44.125 --> 58:46.660
You have strangers
following you?

58:46.694 --> 58:48.029
- Creepy.
- You know what?

58:48.062 --> 58:50.197
That's what I don't understand
about social media.

58:50.231 --> 58:53.067
Why do they even care
about what you're doing?

58:53.267 --> 58:55.269
I don't know. I guess
if you just post something

58:55.302 --> 58:58.739
that resonates with someone,
or let's say it's 500 people,

58:58.773 --> 59:01.342
or if you're me these
last few weeks--

59:01.375 --> 59:03.644
-Shall I tell you the truth?
-Yeah.

59:03.677 --> 59:05.880
- Two hundred thousand people.
- What?

59:05.913 --> 59:07.181
Wait, what, what, what, what?

59:07.214 --> 59:08.949
Yeah, two hundred
thousand people.

59:08.983 --> 59:10.651
- All right.
- Get out of here.

59:10.684 --> 59:11.685
Oh!

59:12.887 --> 59:14.588
It's silly to call it
a job-job.

59:14.622 --> 59:16.090
No, no, no, no. I mean, if you--

59:16.123 --> 59:18.626
if you can get a job like that,
I'd say good for you, girl.

59:18.659 --> 59:19.660
-You go.
-Mm-hmm.

59:19.693 --> 59:21.028
You know,
I got an idea.

59:21.062 --> 59:22.730
Let's all get in.
Come on. Let's take a picture.

59:22.763 --> 59:24.899
All of us together.
Okay, here we go.

59:24.932 --> 59:26.734
-Let me get some followers.
-We're gonna get some.

59:26.767 --> 59:28.269
-Raise it up.
-Oh, raise it. Raise it!

59:28.302 --> 59:31.072
Don't you think-- Tilt it more?
What if I tilt it--

59:31.105 --> 59:33.207
Now make your sexy face.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.608
All right, there. Go.

59:34.642 --> 59:35.609
Yeah-uh.

59:35.643 --> 59:36.777
No, no. I think--

59:37.945 --> 59:39.213
<i>♪ It's hard to share you ♪</i>

59:39.246 --> 59:40.848
<i>-♪ With anyone else ♪</i>
-Oh, what the hell?

59:40.881 --> 59:42.016

No, no. Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. No, no.

1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:35.302
Knix just slid into my DMs.

1:00:35.669 --> 1:00:37.771
They saw my post
from the Pilates party,

1:00:37.805 --> 1:00:41.275
and, my God, they want me
to be a brand ambassador.

1:00:41.709 --> 1:00:44.178
Yeah, they said,
"We've been looking for..."

1:00:44.211 --> 1:00:47.948
"...a fierce,
sophisticated woman

1:00:47.982 --> 1:00:49.850
to slay on their feed!"

1:00:49.884 --> 1:00:51.886
Oh, that sounds pretty dope.

1:00:51.919 --> 1:00:55.222
It is. It is so dope! Man!

1:00:55.756 --> 1:00:58.192
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, wait a minute.

1:00:58.225 --> 1:01:00.127
Look what I just--
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

1:01:00.161 --> 1:01:03.063
They're-- they're offering
100,000-dollar...

1:01:03.097 --> 1:01:05.466
exclusive engagement fee.

1:01:05.499 --> 1:01:07.468
-Whoa, 100,000 dollars?
-Oh, my God.

1:01:07.501 --> 1:01:09.236
You can take half
of that into an IRA

1:01:09.270 --> 1:01:10.471
and the rest in
a simple index fund,

1:01:10.505 --> 1:01:12.406
-and you will be sitting pretty.
-Whoa!

1:01:12.439 --> 1:01:14.141
Surprisingly robust advice

1:01:14.175 --> 1:01:16.343
from a man
in daytime sweatpants.

1:01:16.377 --> 1:01:17.745
Okay. It's a man

1:01:17.778 --> 1:01:19.079
whose life strategically
allows him to wear

1:01:19.113 --> 1:01:20.247
-daytime sweatpants. Thank you.
-Oh.

1:01:20.281 --> 1:01:21.749
Now please respond to this.

1:01:21.782 --> 1:01:23.384
Well, of course.
That goes without saying.

1:01:23.417 --> 1:01:25.819
-Whoo!
-This is very cool, Rita.

1:01:25.853 --> 1:01:28.856
So cool. Wow!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:01:28.889 --> 1:01:30.958
I'm so happy. Yeah.

1:01:44.271 --> 1:01:47.141
Oh, dear. Whoo, whoo. Yeah. Wow.

1:01:47.576 --> 1:01:49.977
Anyway, do you still
want to order, or--?

1:01:50.010 --> 1:01:51.513
-Yeah, that's-- yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, that's a good idea.

1:01:51.546 --> 1:01:53.914
Yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna
go grab my laptop, I'll--

1:01:53.948 --> 1:01:55.983
and so we can look together.
I'll be right back.

1:01:56.016 --> 1:01:58.819
Okay, yep. That's a--
a-- a smart idea.

1:01:58.852 --> 1:02:00.054
Smart. Yeah.

1:02:07.461 --> 1:02:10.231
Um...

1:02:11.899 --> 1:02:13.000
-Honestly, we can just eat...
-What?

1:02:13.033 --> 1:02:14.902
-...in my car.
-No, no, no, no.

1:02:14.935 --> 1:02:16.870
No way. No,
just watch and learn.

1:02:17.238 --> 1:02:19.974
Oh, uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1:02:20.374 --> 1:02:24.144
But you chickens
wouldn't mind scooting over

1:02:24.178 --> 1:02:25.846
just a little smidge
for an old gal?

1:02:25.879 --> 1:02:27.348
Oh, it's so sweet of you.

1:02:27.381 --> 1:02:28.983
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:02:29.016 --> 1:02:30.184
Thank you so much.

1:02:30.217 --> 1:02:31.452
Oh, my goodness.

1:02:31.485 --> 1:02:33.787
Ooh. Ah.

1:02:34.855 --> 1:02:35.956
Okay.

1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:40.494
I kissed Jack.

1:02:41.195 --> 1:02:44.498
Like in one
of those for-real, big time--

1:02:44.865 --> 1:02:46.166
-What?
-Oh, my God.

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:47.535
Carla, I just went for it.

1:02:47.569 --> 1:02:50.137
A real, big-time...

1:02:51.372 --> 1:02:52.773
...romantically interested kiss.

1:02:53.073 --> 1:02:56.110
Stop! Carla, I just kind of said
to myself, "You go for it,"

1:02:56.143 --> 1:02:58.145
because when have
I ever even done that?

1:02:58.178 --> 1:03:01.081
Initiate a kiss?
It's like a first kiss?

1:03:01.115 --> 1:03:03.017
I just don't even
do things like that.

1:03:03.450 --> 1:03:05.419
Okay. You're not
the only one with a surprise.

1:03:05.620 --> 1:03:06.987
What do you mean?

1:03:10.257 --> 1:03:12.426
Your boy is gonna be
downtown this weekend,

1:03:12.459 --> 1:03:14.161
-doing a pop-up.
-Uh-huh.

1:03:14.194 --> 1:03:15.896
Regress and be blessed.

1:03:20.301 --> 1:03:21.402
You okay?

1:03:21.935 --> 1:03:25.205
Well, yeah. I mean,
I'm really good.

1:03:25.239 --> 1:03:28.876
I mean, it obviously would be
crazy to keep living like this.

1:03:29.410 --> 1:03:30.444
Yeah, Mack.

1:03:30.944 --> 1:03:33.280
Everything that's happening
for you right now

1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:37.251
is because you're showing
the world who you are, right?

1:03:37.284 --> 1:03:40.321
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

1:03:41.188 --> 1:03:42.456
Oh, yeah. It's Stephanie.

1:03:42.489 --> 1:03:44.291
I gotta get this.
I'll be right back.

1:03:44.958 --> 1:03:47.629
Hey, listen, I'm kind of
in the middle of something,

1:03:47.662 --> 1:03:48.896
so can I call you back?

1:03:48.929 --> 1:03:50.497
Knix needs Rita

1:03:50.532 --> 1:03:52.933
to appear at
the <i>Marie Claire</i> Power Summit.

1:03:52.966 --> 1:03:56.638
It's a big deal.
Santa Monica Beach by the pier.

1:03:56.671 --> 1:03:58.372
Friday. They need me
to confirm today.

1:03:58.740 --> 1:04:01.909
Oh, wow. I mean,
that is so cool.

1:04:01.942 --> 1:04:05.012
- But what is that anyway?
<i>- Oh, I don't know,</i>

1:04:05.045 --> 1:04:08.516
just a major event that
celebrates the power of women

1:04:08.550 --> 1:04:10.417
thrown by a publication
you would die to have

1:04:10.451 --> 1:04:12.052
your little,
stinky pieces run in?

1:04:12.086 --> 1:04:13.220
- Oh.
<i>- Knix</i>

1:04:13.253 --> 1:04:14.388
<i>is a top spons,</i>

1:04:14.656 --> 1:04:18.092
and they wanna roll out
Rita's ambassadorship with them.

1:04:18.125 --> 1:04:19.561
I really can't. I--

1:04:19.594 --> 1:04:21.362
I mean, that's the night
of Carla's rehearsal dinner.

1:04:21.395 --> 1:04:23.130
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I don't think they really care</i>

1:04:23.163 --> 1:04:24.965
if you're there.

1:04:24.998 --> 1:04:27.101
I mean, you could go if you
want to get a swag bag of,

1:04:27.134 --> 1:04:28.536
<i>like, free yoni eggs</i>
<i>or something,</i>

1:04:28.570 --> 1:04:30.437
but Knix has made it
crystal clear

1:04:30.672 --> 1:04:32.674
that the event is mandatory
for Rita.

1:04:32.707 --> 1:04:35.309
So, please make sure she shows.

1:04:48.088 --> 1:04:50.357
- Hey.
- Hey, nice robe.

1:04:50.391 --> 1:04:52.259
Thanks. Wore it home
from the spa.

1:04:52.292 --> 1:04:54.696
Um, I just don't understand
how someone

1:04:54.729 --> 1:04:58.600
so handsome, thank you,
could be quite so strange.

1:04:58.833 --> 1:05:00.535
Well, I was, uh,

1:05:00.568 --> 1:05:02.002
in the fifth percentile
for weight

1:05:02.035 --> 1:05:03.971
-until I was, like, 17, so--
-Oh.

1:05:04.004 --> 1:05:06.273
My personality just developed
before my looks.

1:05:06.306 --> 1:05:08.175
And so that explains everything.

1:05:08.208 --> 1:05:10.010
-Yeah. Shall I?
-Yeah.

1:05:10.043 --> 1:05:11.945
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes.

1:05:13.748 --> 1:05:15.916
- So, how was your day?
- So--

1:05:16.483 --> 1:05:18.952
What, uh-- what's going on?
You all right?

1:05:18.986 --> 1:05:21.623
-You have a rough day or what?
-Oh, yeah, I just--

1:05:21.656 --> 1:05:25.259
Oh, God. I have
to make a big decision

1:05:25.292 --> 1:05:27.629
and I just hate
making big decisions.

1:05:29.531 --> 1:05:32.534
Mm. That's so weird
because I love big decisions.

1:05:32.567 --> 1:05:34.234
-Hit me.
-Okay. I--

1:05:34.935 --> 1:05:38.038
So, there's this big
Knix partner event

1:05:38.071 --> 1:05:41.509
on the same day
as Carla's rehearsal dinner.

1:05:41.543 --> 1:05:43.410
So, skip the rehearsal dinner.

1:05:43.444 --> 1:05:47.047
Well, Jack, I mean, that's
a really huge thing to skip.

1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:50.017
I've never gotten married
before, but if I did,

1:05:50.050 --> 1:05:51.385
I don't think that
I would care that much

1:05:51.418 --> 1:05:54.254
if my best friend's
aunt wasn't there.

1:05:54.288 --> 1:05:55.456
-I can't miss it.
-Okay,

1:05:55.489 --> 1:05:56.691
well, then skip the event.

1:05:56.925 --> 1:05:59.761
No, but I-- but, you know,
then I'll lose my contract.

1:05:59.794 --> 1:06:03.230
I'll lose the 100,000 dollars.

1:06:03.964 --> 1:06:07.034
Uh, okay.
Do you have the contract?

1:06:07.067 --> 1:06:08.402
Can I-- can I see
the paperwork on it?

1:06:08.435 --> 1:06:09.737
-Yeah, no--
-On your phone?

1:06:09.771 --> 1:06:11.171
Oh, that-- You don't have
to do that.

1:06:11.205 --> 1:06:12.574
No, I'm-- I'm very good
at this kinda thing.

1:06:12.607 --> 1:06:13.775
-Trust me.
-Oh. Yeah, no. Okay.

1:06:13.808 --> 1:06:15.275
-Yeah.
-Sure. Of course.

1:06:15.309 --> 1:06:17.044
Okay. It's right-- it's on here.

1:06:17.077 --> 1:06:19.079
-Okay.
-See, it's right there. Okay.

1:06:20.748 --> 1:06:25.052
-Okay. Okay, so...
-What?

1:06:25.085 --> 1:06:27.689
Uh, this only says that
you have to attend the event,

1:06:27.722 --> 1:06:29.389
but it doesn't say anything
about how long

1:06:29.423 --> 1:06:31.024
-you have to stay there for.
-Oh, really?

1:06:31.058 --> 1:06:33.126
So, why don't you just
go to the event,

1:06:33.661 --> 1:06:35.362
and then leave early,

1:06:35.395 --> 1:06:37.431
and you'll make it in time
for the rehearsal dinner.

1:06:37.464 --> 1:06:39.333
You know what?
This is such a great idea.

1:06:39.366 --> 1:06:41.636
-Of course!
-You sound surprised.

1:06:41.669 --> 1:06:42.804
Well, I'm not surprised.

1:06:42.837 --> 1:06:44.739
I mean, you're--
you're very smart.

1:06:44.772 --> 1:06:46.508
-I'm smart.
-Yes, you are.

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:48.710
Yeah. See, finally some honesty.

1:06:48.743 --> 1:06:51.378
I can't help it.
I'm sorry.

1:06:51.411 --> 1:06:54.649
-Oh, boy. I need some wine.
-Yeah.

1:06:57.084 --> 1:07:00.153
Oh, excuse me, but, you know,
I have to leave early.

1:07:00.187 --> 1:07:01.388
But it's not a problem.

1:07:02.422 --> 1:07:04.124
Um, hi, hello.

1:07:04.157 --> 1:07:06.293
Rita Martin.
That's my name. Yes.

1:07:07.394 --> 1:07:08.428
Rita,
over here.

1:07:08.462 --> 1:07:09.496
Is that Rita Martin?

1:07:09.964 --> 1:07:12.266

-Not to brag,

1:07:40.828 --> 1:07:42.195
they had to reach out to you.

1:07:42.229 --> 1:07:44.197
Well, thank you.
Really? I--

1:07:44.231 --> 1:07:46.534
Wow. It's just,
I appreciate that so much.

1:07:46.568 --> 1:07:47.735
-You've got to come...
-Where?

1:07:47.769 --> 1:07:48.870
...to the VIP area for Urth.

1:07:48.903 --> 1:07:51.271
Oh, oh, well. Earth?

1:07:51.305 --> 1:07:53.373
Urth. She's leading the
collective breathing seminar

1:07:53.407 --> 1:07:54.642
that's closing out the day.

1:07:54.842 --> 1:07:56.476
Oh, no. You know, I really--
honestly, I can't do that.

1:07:56.511 --> 1:07:57.812
-Thank you so much.
-You crack me up.

1:07:57.845 --> 1:07:59.514
-Come on. Come on.
-Yeah, oh, what do you mean?

1:07:59.847 --> 1:08:01.081
-Oh.
-You know,

1:08:01.315 --> 1:08:03.483
I was one of the 10,000
to unfollow Lil' Yachty

1:08:03.518 --> 1:08:05.485
after he commented
that your sweater was too loose.

1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:07.120
-What was that?
-Oh.

1:08:07.154 --> 1:08:10.157
Oh, I don't know. You know,
he's obsessed with me.

1:08:10.190 --> 1:08:13.460
-It's honestly kind of weird.
-Well, so am I.

1:08:13.493 --> 1:08:16.598
So, anyway, just enjoy
the event, and I'm just gonna

1:08:16.631 --> 1:08:18.600
capture some video
of you in your natural habitat.

1:08:18.633 --> 1:08:20.535
-Okay?
-Okay, but wait, wait.

1:08:20.568 --> 1:08:22.570
I want to thank you
for this offer, of course...

1:08:22.604 --> 1:08:24.438
-Yeah, you bet.
-...but just one quick thing.

1:08:24.471 --> 1:08:26.340
-Hmm?
-Um, I have my best friend's

1:08:26.373 --> 1:08:28.610
rehearsal dinner tonight.
So, actually, I'm--

1:08:28.643 --> 1:08:29.711
I'm gonna have to leave now.

1:08:30.210 --> 1:08:31.846
-I totally hear you...
-So, anyway--

1:08:31.879 --> 1:08:33.380
...but if you could just

1:08:33.413 --> 1:08:34.849
stick around for
a few more minutes, okay?

1:08:34.882 --> 1:08:36.751
We're gonna be streaming
this on Instagram Live,

1:08:36.784 --> 1:08:39.687
and I want to make sure
that you are front and center.

1:08:39.721 --> 1:08:42.356
Yeah, oh. Oh, but, you see,

1:08:42.389 --> 1:08:44.626
that's the opposite
of what I said I wanted to do.

1:08:44.659 --> 1:08:46.594
-Mm. Yeah. Mm.
-Uh-huh.

1:08:46.628 --> 1:08:48.563
But it's just, we have to make
sure that our new partners

1:08:48.596 --> 1:08:50.163
are familiar with our followers.

1:08:50.197 --> 1:08:51.733
-Uh-huh. I see--
-That's how it works.

1:08:51.766 --> 1:08:54.368
I've seen some incredible
partners lose contracts...

1:08:54.401 --> 1:08:55.670
-Yeah, but--
-...just because the fans

1:08:55.703 --> 1:08:57.337
-don't see them as friends.
-Oh.

1:08:57.371 --> 1:09:00.240
So, no pressure, you know,
but make it organic, you know?

1:09:00.273 --> 1:09:01.843
Have your own experience and--

1:09:01.876 --> 1:09:04.244
and we are looking to create
some moments here.

1:09:04.277 --> 1:09:06.380
-So, energy up! Big smiles.
-Well-- Wait, what?

1:09:06.413 --> 1:09:08.215
Rah-rah-rah! Yeah.

1:09:09.651 --> 1:09:12.887
All right, my warriors.

1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:16.758
Who's ready to find their light?

1:09:18.826 --> 1:09:19.861
Oh, my warriors.

1:09:19.894 --> 1:09:23.731
I want you to repeat after me.

1:09:23.931 --> 1:09:24.899
For us!

1:09:25.165 --> 1:09:27.267
Okay. For us!

1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:30.303
For you! For me!

1:09:30.337 --> 1:09:31.739
Let me hear you!

1:09:31.773 --> 1:09:32.740
For us!

1:09:33.541 --> 1:09:34.742
For you!

1:09:34.776 --> 1:09:36.410
For you!

1:09:36.611 --> 1:09:37.979
For me!

1:09:38.012 --> 1:09:39.246
For me!

1:09:39.781 --> 1:09:41.248
For us!

1:09:41.281 --> 1:09:42.884
For you!

1:09:42.917 --> 1:09:45.787
- Yeah.
- For me! Oh, yes.

1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:48.723
Your chanting,
it nourishes my soul.

1:09:48.756 --> 1:09:51.893
-Ah!
-We are not here to work out

1:09:51.926 --> 1:09:56.831
our abs or our glutes
or our triceps. No.

1:09:57.197 --> 1:10:00.500
We are here
to work on our souls.

1:10:00.535 --> 1:10:03.805
Our soul!

1:10:03.838 --> 1:10:05.238
Ho-ho.

1:10:05.272 --> 1:10:08.241
We did not come here
to exercise our bodies.

1:10:08.275 --> 1:10:09.510
No.

1:10:09.544 --> 1:10:15.415
We came here
to exploresize our demons!

1:10:15.650 --> 1:10:17.785
- For me!
- Let me hear you!

1:10:18.052 --> 1:10:20.888
For us! For you!

1:10:20.922 --> 1:10:22.924
For me!

1:10:22.957 --> 1:10:25.960
Oh, yes! I feel it.

1:10:25.993 --> 1:10:28.730
I feel it, you are powerful. Oh!

1:10:28.763 --> 1:10:30.898
That is a warrior right there!

1:10:30.932 --> 1:10:32.834
-Huh?
-Yes. Come on up here.

1:10:32.867 --> 1:10:35.770
- Really?
- Come on. Come on, yes!

1:10:37.370 --> 1:10:39.574
Come on up here!
Yes, warrior!

1:10:39.607 --> 1:10:42.810
Yes! Oh! Yes!

1:10:52.319 --> 1:10:54.321
I am a warrior.

1:10:54.354 --> 1:10:56.924
I am a warrior!

1:10:56.958 --> 1:10:59.994
Yes! Yes!

1:11:00.027 --> 1:11:01.929
Squat and feel it, yeah!

1:11:02.830 --> 1:11:06.033
No!

1:11:06.067 --> 1:11:08.002
-You're on fire!
-On fire!

1:11:09.937 --> 1:11:11.773
Everybody, let's not panic.
Let's just grab a buddy.

1:11:14.341 --> 1:11:15.510
Everybody calm down!

1:11:15.910 --> 1:11:18.012
Everybody, it's gonna be good!
We're gonna be okay.

1:11:18.045 --> 1:11:19.680
Everybody just-- just--

1:11:19.714 --> 1:11:20.815
Yeah. That--
Move in that direction.

1:11:20.848 --> 1:11:23.416
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

1:11:23.450 --> 1:11:24.952
I-- I think you should--

1:11:24.986 --> 1:11:26.353
Help!

1:11:26.386 --> 1:11:28.856
Carla, Carla, it's me.
I'm almost there.

1:11:29.223 --> 1:11:32.927
I'm really, I'm-- I'm--
Quite frankly, I'm there.

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.327
Really. I mean--

1:11:39.133 --> 1:11:40.601
So, we'll see
you guys tomorrow.

1:11:40.635 --> 1:11:43.004
- Love you.
- Carla?

1:11:44.872 --> 1:11:46.974
Carla. Oh!

1:11:47.474 --> 1:11:49.811
-Are you okay?
-I--

1:11:49.844 --> 1:11:52.747
I just, I got stuck
at that <i>Marie Claire</i> thing,

1:11:52.780 --> 1:11:55.016
and, you know,
it's the kind of situation

1:11:55.049 --> 1:11:57.718
where you just don't know
what you can say no

1:11:57.752 --> 1:11:59.754
to and-- and what you can't.

1:12:01.622 --> 1:12:04.826
And I set myself on fire.
I know. It's crazy.

1:12:10.397 --> 1:12:12.700
I'm not gonna lie, Mack.

1:12:12.733 --> 1:12:16.904
I'm really, really bummed
you didn't make it tonight.

1:12:17.672 --> 1:12:20.875
You missed my rehearsal dinner
for an influencer event?

1:12:22.043 --> 1:12:25.112
-You're my maid of honor.
-I-- I know. I--

1:12:25.546 --> 1:12:27.915
You've been my best friend
my whole life.

1:12:27.949 --> 1:12:30.885
And I've loved
every single version of you.

1:12:31.152 --> 1:12:34.989
But right now,
Mack, Rita, whatever,

1:12:35.422 --> 1:12:38.526
I don't recognize the person
standing in front of me.

1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:41.128
And it has nothing to do
with what you look like.

1:12:41.162 --> 1:12:43.865
I'm-- I'm so sorry, Carla.

1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:49.637
The one thing we've always done
for one another is show up.

1:12:50.037 --> 1:12:54.508
You didn't do that tonight.
And it just really makes me sad.

1:13:05.586 --> 1:13:06.654
Oh, God.

1:13:07.121 --> 1:13:08.990
I don't know
what I'm doing half the time.

1:13:27.141 --> 1:13:30.111
Hey, thought I'd find you
up here.

1:13:30.144 --> 1:13:31.112
-Is everything okay?
-Oh.

1:13:31.846 --> 1:13:32.947
Yeah.

1:13:33.413 --> 1:13:34.715
-Hey.
-What?

1:13:34.749 --> 1:13:36.217
Rita, look at me.

1:13:36.250 --> 1:13:37.818
- Please, Jack.
- Whoa, whoa.

1:13:37.852 --> 1:13:39.587
Hey, hey, hey.
No. It's okay. It's okay.

1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:41.222
Look, you don't have to be
embarrassed in front of me.

1:13:41.255 --> 1:13:42.623
- No.
- Here, here.

1:13:43.691 --> 1:13:45.760
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1:13:45.793 --> 1:13:48.029
I'm just so really frustrated
with who I am right now.

1:13:48.696 --> 1:13:51.766
Because I haven't always been
like this, Jack, you see.

1:13:52.366 --> 1:13:55.803
You know, I thought, like,
being in a different place,

1:13:55.836 --> 1:13:57.538
you know,
it'd help me feel better.

1:13:57.939 --> 1:13:59.774
You know, it'd help me
be a better person.

1:14:00.408 --> 1:14:05.980
But today, I was worse, just--
I was a bad friend.

1:14:06.013 --> 1:14:08.616
It just sounds
like you had a really bad day,

1:14:09.050 --> 1:14:11.786
but that doesn't make
you a bad person.

1:14:12.186 --> 1:14:13.921
-Jack--
-No, you are one

1:14:13.955 --> 1:14:15.923
of the best people
that I've ever met.

1:14:15.957 --> 1:14:18.059
Why? Why are you
being so nice to me?

1:14:18.092 --> 1:14:20.194
Why? Huh?

1:14:22.763 --> 1:14:26.167
-Don't do that.
-Because I like you.

1:14:29.704 --> 1:14:32.673
What's the matter
with you anyway? Huh?

1:14:32.707 --> 1:14:34.542
I mean, you want,
like, a full list?

1:14:34.575 --> 1:14:36.577
No, no, I'm really serious.

1:14:36.610 --> 1:14:40.681
You spent the past month
hanging out with an old lady

1:14:40.715 --> 1:14:42.883
like she's your girlfriend
or something.

1:14:42.917 --> 1:14:45.019
What are you trying
to avoid, Jack?

1:14:45.052 --> 1:14:46.620
Nothing.

1:14:47.487 --> 1:14:49.557
Listen, I know that my life
doesn't look like

1:14:49.590 --> 1:14:51.125
what you think a 40-year-old's
life should look like,

1:14:51.158 --> 1:14:52.893
but I love it.

1:14:52.927 --> 1:14:55.763
And I have done enough therapy
to know that I like myself.

1:14:55.796 --> 1:14:58.232
And when I met you, I saw
someone who was comfortable

1:14:58.265 --> 1:15:01.802
being exactly who they are.
And I know that--

1:15:03.204 --> 1:15:04.805
you know, you're not going
to be here forever.

1:15:04.839 --> 1:15:06.307
You've got your own
life to go back to.

1:15:06.340 --> 1:15:10.644
Exactly. I have a life, Jack.

1:15:11.112 --> 1:15:13.280
And I've lost sight
of who I really am.

1:15:13.314 --> 1:15:14.849
Do you understand what I mean?

1:15:14.882 --> 1:15:16.684
I mean,
I can't really stay here.

1:15:16.717 --> 1:15:19.120
I just can't stay here, Jack.
I can't do that anymore.

1:15:41.242 --> 1:15:42.309
Wha-oh!

1:15:43.811 --> 1:15:45.846
You wanna tell us
what's going on...

1:15:46.113 --> 1:15:47.248
Mack?

1:15:50.117 --> 1:15:52.286
Well, I need a refill.
Anyone else?

1:15:52.521 --> 1:15:55.890
Yeah. If what
you just said is true,

1:15:55.923 --> 1:15:58.893
I cannot possibly tell
you how stupid you sound.

1:15:58.926 --> 1:16:02.596
-Nobody wants to be old.
-No, no. Sure they do.

1:16:02.797 --> 1:16:04.165
Yes.

1:16:04.198 --> 1:16:06.867
My grammie used to always say
this thing about, like,

1:16:06.901 --> 1:16:09.737
how when you're old, you get
the best seat at the table.

1:16:09.770 --> 1:16:11.272
Oh, you get any seat
at the table,

1:16:11.305 --> 1:16:13.040
because people know
your bones hurt.

1:16:14.775 --> 1:16:16.610
You get the best seat
at the table

1:16:16.644 --> 1:16:21.115
because you realize
what you want and don't want.

1:16:21.148 --> 1:16:23.317
And maybe the best seat
at the table

1:16:23.584 --> 1:16:26.887
is in the other damn room,
where you're 30.

1:16:26.921 --> 1:16:28.789
Right.

1:16:28.823 --> 1:16:32.126
Rita, I-- I mean Mack.
You know those 30 years

1:16:32.159 --> 1:16:35.229
you skipped so that you could,
uh, maybe wear, uh,

1:16:35.262 --> 1:16:37.364
elastic waistbands
and, uh, whatever?

1:16:39.100 --> 1:16:41.836
Those are the good years.
Those are the you years.

1:16:41.869 --> 1:16:44.238
And you really don't want
to skip those.

1:16:44.271 --> 1:16:46.674
- Nuh-uh.
- The 30 after that,

1:16:46.707 --> 1:16:49.677
they're good, too.
But, oh, those middle years...

1:16:49.710 --> 1:16:50.845
Oh, man. Mwah!

1:16:50.878 --> 1:16:53.647
It's not magic,
sweetheart.

1:16:53.681 --> 1:16:55.950
-It's just work.
-Oh.

1:16:55.983 --> 1:16:59.086
You? You had
to work on yourself?

1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:00.321
Oh.

1:17:00.754 --> 1:17:03.791
I was married
to a man named Steve.

1:17:04.291 --> 1:17:08.896
And then I spent my middle age
building a home

1:17:08.929 --> 1:17:10.931
with a woman named Tina, so...

1:17:10.965 --> 1:17:11.999
- Tina.
- Mm-hmm.

1:17:12.333 --> 1:17:18.172
Yeah, I did some work.
Mack, sweetheart,

1:17:18.973 --> 1:17:24.912
you didn't want to be old.
What you wanted was to be you.

1:17:24.945 --> 1:17:26.113
Mm-hmm.

1:17:35.022 --> 1:17:36.891
- I gotta go, okay?
- You got to go.

1:17:36.924 --> 1:17:38.459
- You go, girl.
- Yeah.

1:17:38.492 --> 1:17:41.395
You girls lock it up
on your way out, okay?

1:17:41.428 --> 1:17:43.063
And get that hair
out of your face.

1:17:43.097 --> 1:17:44.732
I'm trying.

1:17:44.765 --> 1:17:46.167
-Okay, now I'll have some more.
-Oh, yeah, baby.

1:18:03.751 --> 1:18:07.021
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay. Wow.

1:18:15.129 --> 1:18:17.965
Okay. Okay, hell. Okay.

1:18:19.333 --> 1:18:22.169
Luca! Luca!

1:18:22.203 --> 1:18:24.438
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

1:18:24.738 --> 1:18:27.107
Luca! Luca!

1:18:28.242 --> 1:18:30.978
Luca! Lu-- oh!

1:18:31.478 --> 1:18:34.181
-Do you have an appointment?
-No. No, Luca.

1:18:34.215 --> 1:18:35.482
I don't have
an appointment, Luca.

1:18:35.983 --> 1:18:37.885
Okay, you're coming in
with a lot of energy.

1:18:37.918 --> 1:18:39.286
-We don't really do that here.
-Uh-huh. Really?

1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:40.254
You didn't turn me into this?

1:18:40.689 --> 1:18:42.856
I happen to be
a 30-year-old woman...

1:18:43.057 --> 1:18:46.160
-Keep it down.
-...and this is not my face!

1:18:46.193 --> 1:18:47.928
-Mm.
-And this is not my hair.

1:18:47.962 --> 1:18:49.463
And guess what?
This is not my body!

1:18:49.496 --> 1:18:50.898
Okay, look, lady.
I don't know what drugs

1:18:50.931 --> 1:18:52.199
-you're on right now--
-You did this to me!

1:18:52.233 --> 1:18:53.801
but this is
an old broken tanning bed

1:18:53.834 --> 1:18:55.970
I got off Craigslist.
It doesn't do anything, okay?

1:18:56.003 --> 1:18:57.404
But wait a second, sir.

1:18:57.672 --> 1:19:01.141
In Palm Springs,
I laid down in that pod,

1:19:01.175 --> 1:19:04.311
and when I came out,
I was in this body.

1:19:04.345 --> 1:19:06.380
Okay, I'm gonna go get you
a cup of water. Maybe--

1:19:06.413 --> 1:19:07.881
No, no, no! Don't you dare!

1:19:08.282 --> 1:19:09.416
You get over here.
You open

1:19:09.450 --> 1:19:10.784
that tin can up right now.

1:19:10.818 --> 1:19:12.052
-All right.
-Yes!

1:19:12.086 --> 1:19:13.187
All right.
Stop yelling at me. Jesus.

1:19:13.220 --> 1:19:14.321
What?

1:19:14.723 --> 1:19:18.192
- Just get in. It's--
- Oh. Oh, my God.

1:19:18.225 --> 1:19:19.426
Go.

1:19:21.028 --> 1:19:22.196
Okay.

1:19:24.765 --> 1:19:26.166
I'm sorry I yelled at you, lady.

1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:28.402
That-- that was
not very Zen of me.

1:19:28.435 --> 1:19:31.272
Come on. Work, okay? Work!

1:19:31.305 --> 1:19:33.440
It's okay. Just calm down.

1:19:33.474 --> 1:19:36.877
Relax. Breathe.

1:19:38.513 --> 1:19:40.881
You're not saying
your whole spiel.

1:19:40.914 --> 1:19:42.216
Please just say it.

1:19:42.249 --> 1:19:45.119
-Please.
-Think about who you are.

1:19:47.187 --> 1:19:48.255
Come on.

1:19:48.590 --> 1:19:50.457
-Think about who you wanna be.
-Work, damn it! Work.

1:19:52.192 --> 1:19:53.327
Come on.

1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:55.429
Life can take you
on a winding path

1:19:55.462 --> 1:19:57.264
that often moves
in both directions.

1:19:57.298 --> 1:19:58.533
Come on!

1:19:58.566 --> 1:20:00.501
It's important to
remember that...

1:20:00.535 --> 1:20:03.404
- Okay.
- ...time is merely a construct.

1:20:03.437 --> 1:20:05.172
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:20:06.340 --> 1:20:09.476
Who you are...

1:20:11.111 --> 1:20:12.514
...who you were...

1:20:16.651 --> 1:20:18.352
Who you're going to be...

1:20:21.790 --> 1:20:23.824
It's all within
you at this very moment.

1:20:55.422 --> 1:20:58.258
Oh, yes.

1:20:58.292 --> 1:21:02.396
Yes! Yes! Oh,
I missed you. I missed you.

1:21:02.896 --> 1:21:07.234
Oh, my God. Hah!

1:21:07.267 --> 1:21:08.369
Whoa!

1:21:13.675 --> 1:21:16.578
Oh!

1:21:18.646 --> 1:21:20.414
This thing...

1:21:20.447 --> 1:21:22.517
Yes!

1:21:22.550 --> 1:21:24.619
Oh.

1:21:24.652 --> 1:21:26.920
Oh, my God.

1:21:28.590 --> 1:21:31.091
I'm back. I'm back.

1:21:33.561 --> 1:21:35.496
Thank you. Thank you.

1:21:35.530 --> 1:21:37.532
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-What just happened?

1:21:37.565 --> 1:21:38.666
I know. It's crazy!

1:21:39.734 --> 1:21:41.301
I need to go. I have to go.

1:21:41.502 --> 1:21:42.570
Thank you!

1:21:44.606 --> 1:21:47.241
You're welcome.

1:22:01.488 --> 1:22:02.624
Carla!

1:22:04.158 --> 1:22:05.560
-Oh!
-Oh!

1:22:08.763 --> 1:22:10.397
Don't cry.

1:22:11.064 --> 1:22:14.168
She's happy.

1:22:14.602 --> 1:22:17.438
- Well--
- I'm gonna cry.

1:22:17.471 --> 1:22:19.473
Don't cry.
You're getting married.

1:22:19.507 --> 1:22:21.676
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful.

1:22:21.709 --> 1:22:24.612
-Oh, my gosh.
-I kinda miss the gray.

1:22:25.112 --> 1:22:27.448
I know. Me, too.

1:22:27.481 --> 1:22:29.551
Oh, it's so good

1:22:29.584 --> 1:22:32.186
to see you,
sweetheart.

1:22:37.559 --> 1:22:40.662
Hi!

1:22:41.028 --> 1:22:44.131
I thought you were dead!

1:22:44.331 --> 1:22:45.365
Go change.

1:22:45.399 --> 1:22:46.568
Yes.
'Cause you are wearing white

1:22:46.601 --> 1:22:48.035
and jeans at a wedding,
and that's crazy.

1:22:48.068 --> 1:22:49.369
Close your mouth, honey.

1:22:51.405 --> 1:22:53.040
We did it.

1:23:03.785 --> 1:23:06.987
Ooh, ooh, yeah.

1:23:16.831 --> 1:23:18.566
Oh! Uh, hey.

1:23:18.999 --> 1:23:20.735
-Hey.
-Hey. Uh--

1:23:22.770 --> 1:23:27.040
Whoo, sorry. Hey, you.

1:23:27.074 --> 1:23:28.743
I'm sorry. It is--
it's weird

1:23:28.776 --> 1:23:30.244
that I'm here right now.

1:23:30.277 --> 1:23:31.613
I-- I realize that.

1:23:31.646 --> 1:23:35.215
I just-- I didn't know if Rita--
She's-- she's gone.

1:23:35.249 --> 1:23:38.118
Oh, yeah. We swapped back.

1:23:38.151 --> 1:23:41.054
Apartments, which is what
we swapped in the first place.

1:23:41.088 --> 1:23:44.324
So, yeah, she's in,
uh, Scottsdale.

1:23:44.358 --> 1:23:46.995
Seriously? I never
even got to say goodbye.

1:23:47.562 --> 1:23:50.598
We, um-- Yeah, we just kind
of were hanging out

1:23:50.632 --> 1:23:51.699
while she was staying here.

1:23:52.366 --> 1:23:55.637
Oh? Hanging out?

1:23:55.670 --> 1:23:58.405
Well, we just both
had nothing to do,

1:23:58.438 --> 1:24:01.141
so we did nothing together.

1:24:03.745 --> 1:24:07.114
She's, um, really not like
anyone I've ever met before.

1:24:10.952 --> 1:24:14.822
Well...
...for what it's worth,

1:24:16.791 --> 1:24:19.561
she told me that
you were really cool, too.

1:24:19.994 --> 1:24:22.597
Maybe a little
too old for a skateboard.

1:24:22.630 --> 1:24:24.264
She said that? I--

1:24:24.298 --> 1:24:26.099
I mean, the-- the first thing,
about being cool?

1:24:26.133 --> 1:24:28.135
Because I knew how she felt
about my skateboard.

1:24:28.502 --> 1:24:30.805
Yeah. She did.

1:24:32.306 --> 1:24:33.240
Cool.

1:24:34.042 --> 1:24:35.810
You think she's ever
coming back?

1:24:37.311 --> 1:24:39.313
Someday, maybe.

1:24:39.614 --> 1:24:41.783
But not for a really,
really long time.

1:24:43.785 --> 1:24:44.852
Okay.

1:24:45.252 --> 1:24:49.356
Uh, if you do talk to her,
please just tell her I said hi.

1:24:49.389 --> 1:24:50.457
I will.

1:24:54.929 --> 1:24:58.766
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Sorry. I, um-- ugh!

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:02.269
I had too many shrimp.
But they were the big ones.

1:25:02.302 --> 1:25:05.138
The jumbo, like, for sure
genetically engineered ones?

1:25:05.172 --> 1:25:06.239
For sure genetically
engineered ones.

1:25:06.273 --> 1:25:07.207
Yeah.

1:25:13.815 --> 1:25:14.882
Okay.

1:25:48.549 --> 1:25:51.184
Congrats on
your new book.

1:25:51.218 --> 1:25:53.387
You know, I've been seeing
a lot of people

1:25:53.420 --> 1:25:55.790
posting pictures of it
on their legs on the beach

1:25:55.823 --> 1:25:58.760
-and they call that hotdogging.
-Oh, very cool.

1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:01.461
I gotta be honest,
I kind of miss Rita.

1:26:01.495 --> 1:26:04.666
Her French exit from the feed
was one of the sexiest things

1:26:04.699 --> 1:26:07.535
I've ever seen,
and I've seen porn.

1:26:07.735 --> 1:26:08.736
Mm-hmm.

1:26:09.137 --> 1:26:12.305
Also, thank you for recommending
the Instagrammies to me.

1:26:12.940 --> 1:26:16.678
The drunkest one, she has
over 500,000 followers

1:26:16.711 --> 1:26:18.245
and it just makes me be like,

1:26:18.278 --> 1:26:19.781
"What have you
ever done for me?"

1:26:19.814 --> 1:26:22.215
Oh, yeah. They're--
they're awesome.

1:26:23.818 --> 1:26:26.319
Oh, wait. S-- s--
co-- yeah, copy that.

1:26:26.554 --> 1:26:27.622
Okay.

1:26:30.792 --> 1:26:31.826
Hi!

1:26:35.730 --> 1:26:38.833
Thank you so much
for coming.

1:26:39.433 --> 1:26:42.770
Hi, bebe. I'm so proud of you.

1:26:46.874 --> 1:26:49.342
Ooh!

1:26:49.911 --> 1:26:51.411
-All right, you ready? Ready?
-Yes. Yes, sorry.

1:26:51.913 --> 1:26:53.313
All right, everyone,
let's get jazzed

1:26:53.346 --> 1:26:56.283
for this reading.

1:26:56.316 --> 1:26:58.351
- Yeah.
- You go, girl.

1:26:58.385 --> 1:27:01.354
Um, so that's me,
right? Uh...

1:27:02.090 --> 1:27:04.826
Hi. Uh, thank you
all for coming.

1:27:04.859 --> 1:27:06.027
Uh-uh.

1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:09.597
I-- I really-- I wanted
to share this book

1:27:09.630 --> 1:27:13.300
with the people in my life
who mean the most to me.

1:27:13.333 --> 1:27:17.337
My first book was a series
of essays about my grandma.

1:27:18.706 --> 1:27:20.440
And until very recently,

1:27:22.409 --> 1:27:24.579
she was
the only person in my life

1:27:24.612 --> 1:27:29.449
who made me feel like
I had license to be myself.

1:27:29.483 --> 1:27:30.885
And when she died,

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:35.790
I-- I thought
that I had lost that.

1:27:36.423 --> 1:27:37.457
I, uh...

1:27:38.526 --> 1:27:43.998
I had a really hard time
feeling like I was enough.

1:27:44.632 --> 1:27:48.736
And, uh, I-- I worried
so much about, you know,

1:27:48.770 --> 1:27:52.507
all the things that made me, me.

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:57.645
That they were
too weird, too different,

1:27:57.678 --> 1:28:00.681
and not fun, not cool.

1:28:00.882 --> 1:28:04.552
And it took a, uh...

1:28:06.386 --> 1:28:09.557
a near-death experience

1:28:11.025 --> 1:28:13.961
to realize that that's not true.

1:28:16.130 --> 1:28:20.333
I realized that the people
in my life who I love--

1:28:20.735 --> 1:28:23.738
love those things about me, too.

1:28:23.771 --> 1:28:27.440
And believing that gave me
the confidence

1:28:28.609 --> 1:28:31.846
to show myself,
you know, to new people.

1:28:33.581 --> 1:28:37.785
And to finally write
another book, so...

1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:41.689
Without further ado...

1:28:44.025 --> 1:28:45.358
Okay.

1:28:46.594 --> 1:28:50.531
Here we go.
