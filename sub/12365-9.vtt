00:13.806 --> 00:15.717
-Henry?
-[indistinct shouting]

00:15.933 --> 00:17.889
Everybody just calm down!

00:18.102 --> 00:19.217
[Trot] What the hell was that,
gunshot?

00:19.437 --> 00:20.677
-All right, that's enough.
-[grunts]

00:25.359 --> 00:26.485
[Travis groaning]

00:27.361 --> 00:29.522
Help. Help.

00:29.739 --> 00:30.945
[groans]

00:34.660 --> 00:35.991
[groans]

00:38.706 --> 00:39.536
[Walt]
Here.

00:42.001 --> 00:42.956
Put your hand on it.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.994
-Yo, where's Tyler?
-Ty|er Malone was here?

00:46.214 --> 00:47.829
He went off into the woods
with some girl.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.880
Shut up! We don't tell
these assholes anything.

00:50.051 --> 00:50.961
We're on the Res.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.875
In fact,
you can't even arrest me.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.710
You ain't getting away
with this shit.

00:54.931 --> 00:57.047
No, that's right.
They ain't the law around here.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.802
You ain't keeping me here.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.178
-|'m gone.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.180
-Everybody just stay
where you are!

01:03.397 --> 01:05.353
-Hold on.
-[groans]

01:05.566 --> 01:06.726
Okay.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.397
-[grunting]
-Come on.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.775
[breathing heavily]

01:16.160 --> 01:17.195
{gasps}

01:17.411 --> 01:19.242
There is no time to rest.
Run!

01:20.540 --> 01:21.780
I hope you brought backup,

01:22.250 --> 01:23.786
'cause we ain't going nowhere
till you let him go.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.411
-[Wa|t] Vic!
-Eamonn!

01:25.628 --> 01:27.334
-[Wa|t] Vic, I need your help!
-You got them?

01:27.547 --> 01:29.458
Yeah. Go.

01:29.674 --> 01:31.335
Everyone back up right now.
Sit down.

01:31.551 --> 01:32.415
[Vic]
Walt!

01:36.055 --> 01:37.841
-Where's the girl?
-What girl?

01:38.057 --> 01:39.843
His friends said he came
back here with a girl.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.640
I don't know.
He's bleeding pretty badly.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.052
I need you to keep pressure
on the wound while I carry him.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.478
Okay.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.396
[Walt] Come on.
Let's get you up, Tyler.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.520
-[grunts]
-[moaning]

01:51.654 --> 01:52.734
Did you find the gun?

01:53.531 --> 01:54.611
Yes.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.280
Did anybody see you?

01:57.285 --> 01:58.650
I do not know.

01:59.495 --> 02:00.826
Is he dead?

02:05.126 --> 02:06.707
[Henry]
Get in.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.093
[groaning]

02:23.644 --> 02:26.431
Vic, go get the Bronco.

02:28.691 --> 02:31.353
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Hey, is that Tyler?

02:31.569 --> 02:32.604
What'd you do to him?

02:32.820 --> 02:33.730
Trying to save his life.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.277
Get him out of here.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.320
Eamonn, take Trot Simic
to the station.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.149
-What about the rest of them?
-Just remember their faces.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.031
-Now go! Go!
-Come on, come on, come on.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.409
[groans]

02:46.626 --> 02:48.662
[siren wailing]

02:49.378 --> 02:51.369
[Walt]
Tyler, who shot you?

02:52.006 --> 02:53.667
Where's the girl you were with?

02:53.883 --> 02:55.669
Did she have
anything to do with this?

02:55.885 --> 02:58.877
Walt, he can't answer.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.754
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.507
He has to make it.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.513
He has too much to answer for.

03:19.659 --> 03:21.570
So, where are you taking me?

03:25.665 --> 03:26.450
Henry!

03:27.500 --> 03:29.786
-Henry!
-[tires screeching]

03:38.636 --> 03:39.842
What do we have?

03:40.054 --> 03:41.965
Gunshot victim.
Tyler Malone.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.341
He's a worker
from the Oden Oil Fields.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.809
-He's also a rapist.
-That's your department.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.519
I'll do my best
with the gunshot.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.140
Eamonn got Trot Simic
back to the station.

03:50.356 --> 03:51.436
Good.

03:51.649 --> 03:52.559
[Vic]
Is it?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.061
Because we thought
that Trot killed Will Balint,

03:55.236 --> 03:56.817
but he couldn't have shot Tyler.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.690
Maybe we got the wrong guy
in custody.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.022
Or maybe we're dealing
with two different killers.

04:03.828 --> 04:04.738
Henry?

04:05.496 --> 04:06.986
Henry?

04:07.206 --> 04:08.662
Wake up.

04:08.874 --> 04:09.704
Henry!

04:09.917 --> 04:12.249
[breathing heavily]

04:15.548 --> 04:17.084
What happened?

04:17.299 --> 04:19.335
I'm not sure.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.044
I think I passed out.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.384
[Gab]
Are you all right?

04:29.854 --> 04:31.060
[grunts]

04:33.315 --> 04:34.270
Oh!

04:36.026 --> 04:37.482
What happened?

04:38.738 --> 04:42.276
I believe I have
a .30-caliber slug in my thigh.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.366
We will need to get it out.

04:46.746 --> 04:48.361
How are we supposed to do that?

04:53.210 --> 04:55.075
The old-fashioned way.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.629
-[monitors beeping]
-[Weston] Scalpel.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.800
Give me some suction.
It's hamburger here.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.377
Debakeys.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.675
Oh, Jesus.

05:27.787 --> 05:29.618
You need to go to the hospital.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.240
Every hospital in Wyoming

05:31.457 --> 05:33.288
will be looking for a man
with a bullet in him.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.291
Gab, you have to do this.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.552
[screams]

06:32.768 --> 06:35.976
[monitors beeping]

06:38.023 --> 06:39.524
[Gab] There's too much blood.
I can't.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.691
Gab... you can.

06:52.413 --> 06:55.905
You remember what I used
to tell you to do

06:56.125 --> 06:58.116
before shooting free throws...

06:59.837 --> 07:01.202
to calm you down?

07:02.590 --> 07:05.172
I'm not that girl anymore.

07:10.014 --> 07:12.300
[crying]

07:16.228 --> 07:17.468
[grunts]

07:25.070 --> 07:26.981
All I need is for you
to hold this.

07:40.294 --> 07:43.081
[crying]

08:08.489 --> 08:10.229
[screaming]

08:14.036 --> 08:15.947
-[tearing]
-[crying]

08:31.971 --> 08:34.587
Dr. Weston's having a hard time
stabilizing the patient.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.096
He said he'll call you tomorrow
if Mr. Malone pulls through,

08:37.309 --> 08:39.516
but, quote,
"don't hold your breath."

08:39.728 --> 08:40.717
-[Walt] Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.225
[sighs]

08:44.441 --> 08:45.351
[Vic]
Walt.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.986
Walker Browning.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.605
That was fast.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.407
[Walker]
Where is he?

08:52.616 --> 08:54.231
-Where's Tyler?
-[Walt] Still in surgery.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.191
One of my guys called,
said he'd been shot.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.118
-Who the hell did it?
-We're finding that out.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.537
I found him alone in the woods.
No witnesses.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.865
ReaHy?
That sounds awful familiar.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.542
Sheriff Longmire
with a man shot, no witnesses.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.130
Hey, back off, asshole.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.624
-Vic.
-| just find it disturbing

09:08.841 --> 09:10.297
that right after you had
to release my guys

09:10.509 --> 09:12.716
for lack of evidence,
they both get hunted down.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.759
I thought Will Balint died
in an oil-rig accident.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.553
Well, if you believe
that's true, Sheriff,

09:16.765 --> 09:18.096
then why is Trot Simic

09:18.308 --> 09:19.434
sitting in yourjail cell
charged with murder?

09:20.019 --> 09:21.805
Seems you always find a way
to get your facts

09:22.021 --> 09:23.010
to line up with your theories.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.598
Now, excuse me.
I got another mother to call.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.922
[groans]

10:08.192 --> 10:09.978
[Gab]
I did the best I could.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.776
Why are you still here?

10:16.992 --> 10:18.607
You should have taken off.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.448
I thought about it.

10:23.665 --> 10:24.745
But...

10:27.252 --> 10:29.117
I couldn't leave Hector here
to die.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.876
I am not Hector.

10:38.013 --> 10:42.598
What you said when
you were beating that scumbag,

10:42.810 --> 10:45.893
I wrote that in my note
word for word.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.054
If you're not Hector,

10:48.273 --> 10:49.524
you should stop reading
his mail.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.065
Well, I guess now
we both have secrets

10:56.281 --> 10:57.532
we need to keep for each other.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.243
How did you know what kind
of bullet you were shot with?

11:08.836 --> 11:11.418
The man who shot me
is my best friend.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.710
The sheriff?

11:14.299 --> 11:17.211
Yes, which is why
we need to leave immediately.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.712
Get in the truck.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.424
What's the point?

11:27.062 --> 11:30.020
The point
is that you shot a man

11:30.232 --> 11:34.271
and I could not tell
whether he was alive or dead.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.360
I don't care.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.360
Gab, if he is alive,
he can identify you.

11:40.576 --> 11:43.238
If he is dead, they will come
after you for murder.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.614
I do not think, given
what you have been through

11:45.831 --> 11:47.321
that that is fair.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.828
l have been in prison.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.080
You do not want to go there.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.543
[groans]

12:00.512 --> 12:02.173
[truck door closes]

12:02.890 --> 12:04.221
Where are we going?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.014
l have no idea.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.850
[engine sputtering]

12:17.196 --> 12:19.608
But wherever it is,

12:19.823 --> 12:21.814
we are going to need
a functioning car.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.488
[door closes]

12:27.581 --> 12:30.197
[Walt] First Will Balint,
now Tyler Malone.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.409
ldon't think there's much doubt
that this is about Gab's rape.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.120
Question is, is it someone
from the oil company

12:36.340 --> 12:37.329
trying to shut them up...

12:38.091 --> 12:40.878
or somebody from the outside
avenging her rape?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.005
Well, there'd have to be
anincenﬁve

12:43.222 --> 12:45.087
for the oil company
to murder their own guys.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.888
Corporate liability?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.011
But nobody even brought charges.

12:49.228 --> 12:50.638
According to Archer Loftus,

12:50.854 --> 12:53.015
Walker Browning
runs a tight ship.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.439
This could be about
somebody stepping out of line.

12:55.651 --> 12:59.235
Maybe Walker had somebody else
do it for him, like last time.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.396
Eamonn, how many roughnecks

13:02.616 --> 13:04.732
were out at that bonfire
last night?

13:05.827 --> 13:08.694
Uh, Trot, Tyler, five others.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.404
Ferg, why don't you see

13:10.624 --> 13:12.489
if that squares
with Trot Simic's recollection?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.245
Yep.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.544
So, if this shooting
isn't about Walker Browning

13:17.756 --> 13:20.372
trying to punish
or silence his own men,

13:20.592 --> 13:23.129
it must be about someone close
to Gab avenging her rape.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.835
You know,
when we spoke to Sam Poteet,

13:25.055 --> 13:26.841
he said that no one
would be able to protect Tyler

13:27.057 --> 13:28.342
once the army mobilized.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.549
Maybe we're back
to your "new Hector" theory.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.761
Maybe. But the time for subtlety
is over.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.812
Why don't you go arrest
Sam Poteet?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.397
[door opens, closes]

13:41.613 --> 13:43.649
I'm sorry, uh, "new Hector"?

13:43.865 --> 13:44.775
Am I missing something?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.449
A copycat vigilante

13:47.661 --> 13:49.572
seems to have started working
on the Res.

13:49.788 --> 13:50.868
Hm.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.913
About the Res...

13:54.126 --> 13:55.866
Yep. Mathias.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.997
We got to call him,
smooth things over.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.833
Well, Mr. Simic
didn't want to talk to me,

14:04.052 --> 14:06.714
but apparently he had quite
a bit to say to Archer here.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.529
I know where to get another car.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.190
Where?

14:29.619 --> 14:31.120
[Gab]
Follow me.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.989
I thought we had a deal,
me and you.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.993
That was like the opposite
of protection.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.589
You threw one of the very fellas
I'm trying to steer clear of

14:41.798 --> 14:43.413
into a jail cell with me.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.169
And we're sorry about that,
Mr. Loftus.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.886
You ain't sorry.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.006
You're in the pocket
of the oil company,

14:49.222 --> 14:50.382
you and that boss of yours.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.805
Nobody here is in the pocket
of the oil company.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.225
What did Trot say to you
just now?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.348
[Archer]
He called me a rat.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.895
Said I turned him in.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.483
But I didn't say boo to you
about him.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.228
That's true.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.436
Did he admit that
he was involved in Will's death?

15:06.782 --> 15:08.113
What'd he say, exactly?

15:09.284 --> 15:11.195
He punched me, exactly.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.277
All right.

15:14.206 --> 15:17.369
We're trying to narrow down
who was with Trot last night.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.449
Can you tell us
who his friends are?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.210
What do | get in return?

15:22.422 --> 15:23.798
Tar and feathered
and locked in a room

15:24.007 --> 15:24.962
with Walker Browning?

15:25.509 --> 15:27.090
We're all sorry
about the misunderstanding

15:27.302 --> 15:29.008
with Trot Simic.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.507
-Now, it's been a long night --
-Stop right there, Sheriff.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.631
My helping-you days
are behind me.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.593
Clearly you busted someone else
for the murder of Will Balint.

15:37.813 --> 15:41.180
So if I'm not under arrest,
I'm out of here.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.480
Adiés.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.896
Miss Victoria,
guess this just wasn't our time.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.110
[door opens]

15:57.082 --> 15:59.243
[Eamonn] Sheriff, you told me
to remember the faces

15:59.459 --> 16:00.869
of the other men at the bonfire.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.451
Before I forget them,

16:02.629 --> 16:04.039
why don't I head back over
to Newett Energy,

16:04.256 --> 16:05.746
see if I can put some names
to those faces?

16:05.966 --> 16:07.297
-Thanks, Eamonn.
-Yeah.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.715
If you need anything else,
call my cell.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.918
Oh, and if, uh,
you can't get through,

16:11.138 --> 16:11.877
try again.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.303
[Walt]
Ferg.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.630
Call Mathias,
let him know what happened.

16:15.851 --> 16:19.014
Meantime, Vic and I will head
to the hospital.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.765
Hope that Tyler's awake.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.017
And after Mathias
is done complaining,

16:23.233 --> 16:24.348
maybe he can help me |.D.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.183
the Cheyenne girls
from the bonfire.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.439
I know what they look like.
ldon't know where to find them.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.746
Keep your head down.
She did not see us.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.791
Or perhaps she did.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.510
Henry.
Thank God.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.463
I have been looking
for Bowstring Road everywhere.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.184
And it's not on my map.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.975
And I -- I'm late for a meeting
with a new client.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.098
Is that Gab Langton?

17:04.483 --> 17:05.768
We were taking a walk.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.144
How is she?

17:08.153 --> 17:09.689
-Better.
-[Cady] Good.

17:09.905 --> 17:13.693
Look, I-I know she doesn't want
to press charges,

17:13.909 --> 17:15.240
but if you could just tell her
that I'm starting

17:15.452 --> 17:16.988
my own pro bono practice,

17:17.204 --> 17:18.319
in case she changes her mind.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.278
Bowstring Road
is not on your map

17:20.499 --> 17:21.705
because it is not paved.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.453
Keep going
the way you were going.

17:23.668 --> 17:26.455
Take your first left
after the power lines stop.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.086
Thanks.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.460
[gearshift clicks]

17:40.810 --> 17:42.641
[groaning]

17:50.403 --> 17:53.145
[Weston] Stomach, spleen,
small intestines.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.902
I took ten copper pellets
and three slugs out of him.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.823
Multiple shots?

17:58.036 --> 18:01.620
Or a personal-defense round --
slugs and shot in one shell.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.245
[Weston]
Nasty stuff.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.544
[Vic] So, you think he's gonna
regain consciousness today?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.118
-w--
-Doctor.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.794
There's, uh, always a chance,

18:10.006 --> 18:12.122
but in this case, I'd, uh,
classify it as "slim."

18:14.678 --> 18:17.715
I didn't notice the bruising
on his face in the dark.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.047
Looks like he took some punches
before he got shot.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.256
[Walt]
Yeah.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.344
Will Balint was made to look
like an accident.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.058
A beating, a shotgun blast.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.311
Sure seems more personal to me.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.314
So it's like you thought --
two different assailants.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.395
Well, it's hard to tell
until we get to take a look

18:35.615 --> 18:37.446
at that crime scene
in the light of day.

18:37.659 --> 18:41.948
Hopefully Mathias isn't too mad,
he'll let us take a look.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.827
You think Tyler here will mind
if I use his bathroom?

18:47.043 --> 18:48.374
I'll see you at the elevator.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.320
And I want to up
the dose of Risperdal

19:17.532 --> 19:19.272
from eight to ten milligrams,
okay?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.322
All right. Great.

19:20.535 --> 19:21.695
[Walt]
Donna.

19:22.621 --> 19:23.781
Oh, hey, Walt.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.113
Uh, what are you doing here?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.665
A suspect got shot.
He's, um -- He's down the hall.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.334
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

19:31.546 --> 19:32.535
-We|l, he's not
such a great guy.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.212
-Oh, right, yeah.

19:34.424 --> 19:37.507
Um, listen, I was actually
just about to call you

19:37.719 --> 19:39.630
on that cellphone
that you don't have.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.258
But I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

19:42.474 --> 19:45.090
-l'm sorry.
-Actually, I'm kind of glad.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.096
Not that you can't make it,
but...

19:47.312 --> 19:49.894
Well, it would have been tough
for me to make it.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.017
So I'm glad
you had to cancel first.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.689
Well, this is not a competition.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.267
No, but I think I'm in front.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.728
-[chuckles]
-So, what are you doing here?

19:57.947 --> 20:00.529
I have a patient who attempted
suicide last night,

20:00.742 --> 20:02.357
so ljust feel like
I need to be here.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.192
-Of course.
-Yeah.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.279
And you? Is your suspect
going to pull through?

20:07.499 --> 20:09.490
[Walt] I don't know.
He was shot in the gut.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.791
There's a lot of bleeding.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.210
Maybe we should, uh,
keep that dinner date.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.334
This would make great dinner
conversation, wouldn't it?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.677
Um, I hope I can get
a rain check.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.218
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.591
[Donna] So, where was I? I think
what we're gonna have to do...

20:31.314 --> 20:33.054
[clears throat]

20:33.274 --> 20:36.266
Isn't that the, uh, psychiatrist
who ran the PTSD support group?

20:36.486 --> 20:37.976
-[elevator bell dings]
-Yep.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.740
Look who's back from the dead.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.200
-I need to borrow your car.
-Take Linda's.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.831
Linda split.
ldon't know where she is.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.503
She's probably on her knees
somewhere.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.081
So, can I have it?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.552
No, sorry.
l-l got shit to do.

21:02.512 --> 21:03.843
Dude, we're out of Apple Jacks.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.511
You're still with him
after his friends raped me?

21:09.728 --> 21:11.810
-He's not like that.
-They're all like that.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.181
You know what? Screw you.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.808
Go back to zombie land.

21:15.734 --> 21:19.067
Give me the keys, or I'll say
there were three of them.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.938
He'll end up dead
just like the other two.

21:24.242 --> 21:25.357
[scoffs]

21:26.327 --> 21:27.612
[sighs]

21:30.540 --> 21:31.575
[keys jingle]

21:31.958 --> 21:34.165
I need it back
before tomorrow night.

21:39.090 --> 21:39.920
Bitch.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.213
Shotgun.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.819
Mathias.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.785
I was just heading upstairs
to call you.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.203
A few hours late.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.572
Yep.
About that --

22:14.793 --> 22:17.000
No, no, I get it.
It was dark.

22:17.212 --> 22:20.579
It's hard to see boundary lines
in the middle of the night.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.460
I guess you already heard
from Ferg.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.664
[Mathias]
Didn't have to.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.503
There was a representative
of Newett Energy

22:25.720 --> 22:27.676
waiting for me when I got
to work this morning.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.470
Let me guess -- Walker Browning?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.138
Yeah, that's the guy.

22:31.351 --> 22:34.309
Well, his men are the ones
who raped Gab Langton.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.479
The one I have upstairs
in my cell is a murderer.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.397
I'm sure he is, but
you're gonna have to let him go.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.482
You know, you can't compel me
to do that, Mathias.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.198
[Mathias]
I'm not trying to compel you.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.318
I'm advising you
that Walker Browning

22:48.535 --> 22:50.321
knows his way around the law.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.028
He knows exactly what he can
and cannot do on the Res.

22:53.248 --> 22:56.081
I promise you, he'll use
the circumstance of that arrest

22:56.292 --> 22:58.544
to get whatever case you have
thrown out.

23:05.593 --> 23:06.708
Ferg.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.089
Yeah?

23:09.305 --> 23:11.261
[Walt]
Release Trot Simic.

23:11.474 --> 23:13.055
[Ferg]
Seriously?

23:13.268 --> 23:14.348
[Walt]
Yep.

23:15.436 --> 23:18.223
You know, last night
happened pretty fast.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.474
I had a hunch our suspect

23:19.732 --> 23:20.687
would be partying
at the bonfire.

23:20.900 --> 23:21.810
I didn't want to lose him.

23:22.026 --> 23:22.856
I got a phone.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.400
You think I would protect

23:24.612 --> 23:25.988
some white oil worker
partying on the Res?

23:29.993 --> 23:31.858
See you assholes later.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.902
Hold on, Trot.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.412
You're now in Absaroka County.
That's my county.

23:40.628 --> 23:41.538
[handcuffs rattle]

23:41.754 --> 23:43.745
You're under arrest.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.125
Take him back upstairs, Ferg.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.547
[Trot]
What the hell?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.215
You can't do that.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.543
[handcuffs clicking]

23:49.762 --> 23:51.718
You have the right
to remain silent.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.718
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

23:54.934 --> 23:57.346
How long you think
that's gonna hold, hmm?

23:58.479 --> 23:59.468
Long enough.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.435
[Henry] We will take a right
just up ahead.

24:04.319 --> 24:05.775
Where are we going?

24:08.948 --> 24:11.325
Somewhere no one will think
to look for you.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.241
[cellphone ringing]

24:28.676 --> 24:29.882
Hello, Walt.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.131
So, Tyler Malone,
the other man who raped Gab,

24:33.348 --> 24:35.054
was shot last night on the Res.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.348
Near that bonfire.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.390
Is he dead?

24:38.603 --> 24:39.683
[Walt]
Not yet.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.642
It's not looking good.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.067
Do you know who did it?

24:48.821 --> 24:51.198
[Wait] I think a guy
from the oil company.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.774
Walker Browning had Will Balint
killed to silence him.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.655
It's possible he tried the same
with Tyler,

24:56.871 --> 25:01.035
but, um, the nature
of the shooting

25:01.250 --> 25:02.535
seems more personal.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.251
Which is why I'm calling.

25:06.255 --> 25:09.543
Gab Langton's mother, Linda,
has been missing for a week.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.251
Linda hardly seems
like a vigilante.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.640
What about Gab?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.134
Have you seen her since you
and I last spoke to her?

25:19.602 --> 25:22.810
When I saw her yesterday,
she seemed beyond caring.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.060
[Walt] Mathias has agreed

25:26.275 --> 25:27.526
to let me take a look
at the crime scene.

25:27.944 --> 25:30.526
Hopefully something turns up
that makes sense of this.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.192
Keep me posted.

25:34.409 --> 25:35.444
[Walt]
Yep.

25:39.622 --> 25:40.657
[tapping]

25:40.873 --> 25:42.033
Stop here.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.141
Drive.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.351
[tapping]

26:04.564 --> 26:05.724
Faster.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.436
[engine revs]

26:16.409 --> 26:17.524
[Vic]
Hey, Walt.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.697
So, Mathias was no help I.D.'ing
those Cheyenne girls

26:20.913 --> 26:22.323
from the, uh, bonfire,

26:22.540 --> 26:24.576
but I've got some ideas
on how to locate them.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.656
Such as?

26:26.169 --> 26:28.000
Well, the easiest
would be to get our hands

26:28.212 --> 26:30.498
on the security-camera footage
from the casino again.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.171
That bridge
is pretty well burned.

26:32.383 --> 26:33.418
We're gonna need a warrant

26:33.801 --> 26:35.337
if we want
to view any more of those tapes.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.214
Okay, so let's get a warrant.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.476
Judge already thinks
I've got it in for Nighthorse.

26:43.186 --> 26:44.426
You kind of do.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.479
Mandy Plitt, uh,

26:48.691 --> 26:50.431
mentioned that she and Gab
were gonna meet somewhere,

26:50.651 --> 26:53.267
some dive bar off the Res.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.900
Uh, the Blind Tiger.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.527
Maybe some of those other girls
hang out there.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.734
Okay.
I'll go check it out.

27:00.953 --> 27:01.908
Okay.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.280
[telephone ringing]

27:09.629 --> 27:11.119
Sheriff Longmire.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.705
[Zachary] It's Zach.
ljust left the casino.

27:13.925 --> 27:17.213
Sam Poteet disappeared yesterday
right after we spoke to him.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.215
Right before Tyler was shot.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.092
Any other ideas
where I might find him?

27:22.308 --> 27:25.641
[sighs] Mathias is gonna meet us
back at the bonfire.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.434
Why don't you join us?

27:27.647 --> 27:30.559
He may know something
about Sam Poteet that we don't.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.556
Yeah.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.209
Hey!

28:01.180 --> 28:03.341
You want something from me?!
Huh?!

28:04.225 --> 28:05.010
Hey.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.510
Got something you want to say
to me, huh?

28:10.314 --> 28:11.850
[tires squeal]

28:21.159 --> 28:22.399
It's okay.

28:23.828 --> 28:25.614
Not everyone is following you.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.489
Not everyone is following you.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.052
Tyler was shot there.

28:50.188 --> 28:51.849
And I fired from here.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.642
[Mathias] So not only
did you come out here

28:54.859 --> 28:55.689
without permission,

28:56.235 --> 28:58.351
but you also discharged
your weapon?

28:58.571 --> 28:59.936
Just once.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.777
But I didn't hit anybody.

29:05.870 --> 29:09.454
Actually,
that might not be true.

29:16.130 --> 29:17.165
Blood.

29:18.507 --> 29:19.838
And over there.

29:20.676 --> 29:21.927
[Mathias]
So you hit him.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.720
If I'd have hit him directly,
he'd have dropped.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.515
Bullet ricocheted off this rock.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.813
I'll send this to the lab
and try to get a match.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.645
Start with Sam Poteet.

29:39.487 --> 29:40.818
Ferg.

29:41.155 --> 29:43.521
That enough of a blood trail
for you to track it?

29:43.741 --> 29:45.732
Oh, I can track
from the footprint alone,

29:45.952 --> 29:47.658
but the blood
will make it that much easier.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.861
Good.
Let us know what you find.

29:50.081 --> 29:50.911
Yeah.

29:51.624 --> 29:54.206
[Zachary]
Sheriff, over here.

30:02.009 --> 30:02.998
[Walt]
What do you got?

30:04.053 --> 30:05.088
[Zachary]
This.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.215
[Walt]
That's a .410 shotshell.

30:07.932 --> 30:09.217
Probably from a Snake Slayer.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.765
It's a yard gun, small,
like a derringer.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.843
Fires
these little shotgun shells.

30:14.772 --> 30:17.479
You got to eject the shell
manually to reload it,

30:17.692 --> 30:20.900
which means the shooter
planned on taking a second shot.

30:21.112 --> 30:24.104
So, a shell this size
caused all that damage?

30:24.323 --> 30:25.733
Well, it's a self-defense round.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.781
It's got three slugs,
a bunch of pellets in it,

30:27.994 --> 30:32.112
which is consistent with what
Doc Weston found in Tyler.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.447
Now at least you know
who you're looking for.

30:35.376 --> 30:36.331
Yep.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.210
Someone
with a Snake Slayer pistol

30:40.423 --> 30:42.789
and a .30-caliber slug
inside them.

30:55.438 --> 30:58.396
[Gab] Wait. We're going
onto the Crow Reservation?

30:58.607 --> 31:00.108
Nobody will think
to look for you here.

31:00.318 --> 31:03.230
Because Cheyenne
aren't exactly welcome here.

31:03.446 --> 31:04.982
We will be welcome.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.692
There is a medicine woman
who lives up in the mountains

31:07.908 --> 31:10.069
far away from anybody else.

31:10.286 --> 31:11.275
A medicine woman?

31:12.496 --> 31:14.452
You believe in
all that old magic stuff?

31:18.127 --> 31:20.960
She has a reputation
for making people disappear.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.669
I don't want to disappear.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.839
I just want to go home.

31:31.974 --> 31:33.214
I know, Gab.

31:34.518 --> 31:35.894
But even if you did go home,

31:36.103 --> 31:38.560
you would not be able
to stay there long.

31:40.024 --> 31:41.855
You have to understand that.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.600
You can never go home again.

31:53.204 --> 31:54.785
[groans]

32:04.632 --> 32:07.044
We will have to go the rest
of the way on foot.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.045
But you can't do that, Henry.

32:10.471 --> 32:11.836
You've been shot.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.341
Yes.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.468
But given the location
of the wound,

32:15.684 --> 32:17.845
I would rather walk right now
than sit.

32:37.832 --> 32:39.914
[heavy metal music playing]

32:52.721 --> 32:54.006
She's a cop.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.386
How's my favorite witness?

33:01.605 --> 33:02.640
[Kiersten chuckles]

33:02.857 --> 33:04.347
No, no.

33:04.567 --> 33:06.273
lain't no witness.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.227
Yeah, we didn't get a chance
to talk last night.

33:10.614 --> 33:13.572
Yeah.
What do you want?

33:13.784 --> 33:16.617
I want to talk to the girl
that was with Tyler Malone.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.865
I don't know any Tyler Malone,

33:19.081 --> 33:21.037
so how am I supposed to know
who he was with?

33:22.376 --> 33:24.116
I'm gonna get another beer.

33:24.837 --> 33:25.792
Want one?

33:26.005 --> 33:26.915
Yeah.

33:28.507 --> 33:32.170
Tyler Malone is the guy
that was shot last night.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.796
Mm, wish I could help you,

33:37.016 --> 33:39.257
but I don't know anything
about that.

33:40.603 --> 33:43.470
-See, I think that you do.
-Hmm.

33:44.815 --> 33:45.679
Hey!

33:45.900 --> 33:47.060
Laila, run!

33:47.985 --> 33:49.566
Shit.

33:49.778 --> 33:50.984
Laila!

33:51.197 --> 33:53.404
God damn.
Laila!

33:53.616 --> 33:54.651
Come on.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.232
[engine sputtering]

34:01.040 --> 34:02.746
Why don't we take my truck
instead?

34:04.668 --> 34:07.375
Found the girl that was
in the woods with Tyler Malone.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.375
Her name is Laila Bixby,
and she's in your office.

34:13.594 --> 34:14.959
She's not limping, too, is she?

34:15.179 --> 34:16.385
No, why?

34:17.181 --> 34:19.172
I was just wondering
if she had a bullet in her.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.131
So, why'd you invite me along,
Philly?

34:21.352 --> 34:23.263
Because she keeps making
all these weird references,

34:23.479 --> 34:25.265
and I figured
maybe you could translate.

34:25.481 --> 34:26.561
She said she was in the woods
with Tyler.

34:26.774 --> 34:28.264
He was forcing himself on her.

34:28.484 --> 34:29.894
And a spirit appeared
and saved her.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.270
-A spirit?
-Yeah.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.736
He didn't have a face.

34:37.201 --> 34:39.066
Laila, are you sure about that?
It was dark.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.196
No.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.785
He was all black,
like part of the night.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.491
But with something red
tied around his neck.

34:47.711 --> 34:50.418
He was fast and strong.

34:50.631 --> 34:52.792
I'm sure he was Tsitsistas.

34:56.554 --> 34:59.341
She's saying the man
who attacked Tyler was Cheyenne.

34:59.557 --> 35:02.094
"Tsitsistas" is our word
for ourselves.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.471
Do you remember anything else

35:05.688 --> 35:07.224
about the man
who attacked Tyler?

35:07.439 --> 35:10.431
As soon as Tyler's arm
was off my throat, I just...

35:11.902 --> 35:13.517
ljust ran.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.523
Did you hear a gunshot?

35:16.615 --> 35:20.073
Yeah, about 30 seconds later.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.401
Hey, Philly,
why don't you take Laila

35:22.621 --> 35:24.361
and get her something to drink?

35:25.207 --> 35:26.947
I don't take orders from you.

35:27.167 --> 35:30.534
Vic, that sounds like
a good idea.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.331
Come on.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.969
[Walt clears throat]

35:48.230 --> 35:50.312
I think I know who she saw.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.608
It's gonna sound
a little crazy --

35:51.817 --> 35:52.681
[Walt] Hector.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.564
I saw the graffiti.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.486
[Mathias]
Yeah.

35:58.699 --> 36:00.109
Well, there's more to it.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.066
People have been leaving notes
at Hector's wall,

36:02.286 --> 36:03.742
asking for his help.

36:03.954 --> 36:06.036
It's how I found out
about those casino muggings.

36:10.085 --> 36:14.795
Not long after Gab's rape...
I found this.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.511
This basically
calls for the execution

36:23.724 --> 36:25.680
of the two men who raped Gab.

36:26.894 --> 36:29.601
So I guess we need to find
who wrote that note.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.644
And the man they wrote it to.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.722
[Mathias] Let's start
with Gab and her family.

36:34.568 --> 36:37.560
[pounding on door]
We're coming in!

36:37.780 --> 36:38.769
[door opens]

36:45.162 --> 36:46.072
Linda?

36:48.624 --> 36:50.114
[Sam]
What are you doing here?

36:51.418 --> 36:55.036
We wanted to talk to Gab, but,
uh, this is a pleasant surprise.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.216
Are you working with him now?

36:58.425 --> 37:00.165
[Walt] We've been looking for
the both of you.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.546
Where you been?

37:04.139 --> 37:06.926
My sister was in Billings. I had
to pick her up. She was ill.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.848
[Vic]
Strung out, more like it.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.977
-Why are you looking for us?
-We'll get to that.

37:12.189 --> 37:13.770
But for right now,
we need handwriting samples

37:13.982 --> 37:15.392
-from each of you.
-Look at her.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.307
She's incapable
of tying her shoe.

37:17.528 --> 37:19.064
Yeah, but you look okay,

37:19.279 --> 37:20.780
so why don't you give us
a handwriting sample?

37:20.989 --> 37:22.445
No.

37:22.658 --> 37:23.613
Just out of principle.

37:24.702 --> 37:27.785
You cannot come in here
and order us around.

37:28.038 --> 37:30.415
-Actually, I can.
-On what grounds?

37:30.624 --> 37:33.832
Suspicion of hiring Hector
to kill Gab's rapist.

37:34.044 --> 37:38.583
Or being Hector yourself,
like we chatted about earlier.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.378
Get a warrant.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.879
Okay.

37:44.096 --> 37:45.506
So, where's Gab?

37:46.432 --> 37:48.218
I don't know. If she's not
in front of the TV,

37:48.434 --> 37:50.015
she's probably in her room.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.013
What's this in the sink?

37:57.484 --> 38:00.146
Laundry. Linda threw up
on the drive back from Billings.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.568
Don't touch that.

38:02.364 --> 38:05.151
Get... a warrant.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.615
Gab's not here.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.781
Linda, you ever, uh,

38:14.001 --> 38:16.492
have any problems with mice
or rats or snakes?

38:16.712 --> 38:17.747
-What?
-Linda,

38:17.963 --> 38:19.078
do not answer his questions.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.084
Ugh, shut up, Sam.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.594
Linda, do you keep a gun handy
to deal with pests in the yard?

38:26.805 --> 38:29.547
Yeah.
It's over the fridge.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.822
.410 shotshells,
just like we found in the woods.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.699
Looks like a handful
are missing.

38:52.915 --> 38:54.997
[Walt]
80's the Snake Slayer.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.034
Sam, take off that shirt.

39:00.964 --> 39:03.080
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?

39:03.300 --> 39:06.963
Sam, just take off the shirt,
then I promise we'll leave.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.926
Fine.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.297
If it'll get you of here.

39:16.939 --> 39:20.056
-What happened to your arm?
-None of your business.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.567
One of Gab's rapists
was shot last night

39:23.779 --> 39:24.939
with a .410 Snake Slayer.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.486
This is not my house.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.404
That is not my gun.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.029
The shooter was hit
with a ricochet from my bullet

39:31.245 --> 39:32.655
when he was fleeing.

39:34.122 --> 39:37.364
-Take off that bandage, Sam.
-No.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.791
You said you would leave
if I took my shirt off. I did.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.336
Now it's time to leave.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.335
And we will,
but you're leaving with me.

39:49.638 --> 39:51.720
I haven't done anything

39:51.932 --> 39:55.174
but drive to the Super 8
in Billings...

39:56.478 --> 39:58.014
and help my sister.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.936
I hope that's true, Sam.

40:09.241 --> 40:11.778
So, I tracked that blood trail
almost a half mile.

40:11.994 --> 40:13.234
Then it stopped by a dirt road.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.660
So the shooter
had a car waiting.

40:15.873 --> 40:18.455
[Ferg] Yeah, the blood stopped
right by a set of tire tracks.

40:20.794 --> 40:23.331
[Walt] Ferg, check
with the Super 8 in Billings.

40:23.547 --> 40:25.083
See if Sam Poteet
or Linda Langton

40:25.299 --> 40:26.880
were there last night.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.593
You think one of them did it?

40:28.802 --> 40:31.259
Well, we found
matching ammunition at the house

40:31.471 --> 40:33.848
and an empty Snake Slayer case.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.593
[Ferg]
I'll call the hotel right now.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.802
Okay.

40:39.229 --> 40:41.720
You know you're trying real hard
to avoid the obvious?

40:42.441 --> 40:44.397
Gab is missing.
So is the gun.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.396
She more than anyone had
a motive to shoot Tyler,

40:46.612 --> 40:48.318
and she knew where to find him.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.527
Let's wait to hear back
from Ferg.

40:57.748 --> 40:59.238
[Vic]
Why are we at the hospital?

41:00.250 --> 41:02.241
[Walt] You need to get
that ankle looked at.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.246
[Vic scoffs]

41:07.883 --> 41:09.794
Are you wearing a new shirt?

41:11.094 --> 41:12.880
I guess lam.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.596
Why'd you change
in the middle of the day?

41:16.808 --> 41:17.934
Felt like it.

41:23.732 --> 41:25.643
Are you seeing someone?

41:27.444 --> 41:28.308
What?

41:29.947 --> 41:31.687
No.

41:34.826 --> 41:35.611
l'll walk you in.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.078
No, that's okay.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.118
I'm fine on my own.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.492
I'll be back in an hour
to pick you up.

41:53.637 --> 41:54.797
[grunts]

42:13.991 --> 42:15.606
We will have to swim across.

42:15.826 --> 42:17.282
You think
Linda ever signed me up

42:17.494 --> 42:19.030
for swimming lessons?

42:22.624 --> 42:25.491
Gab, do not give up now.
We have come this far.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.831
Why are you risking all this
for me?

42:31.216 --> 42:33.298
It'd be better if I drowned.

42:35.971 --> 42:38.508
A lot of people
have let you down, Gab.

42:38.724 --> 42:39.884
I know that.

42:40.100 --> 42:42.557
It is about time
somebody helped you.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.146
Do you know the story
of the Bear Helper?

42:51.278 --> 42:52.142
No.

42:53.822 --> 42:57.314
Well, CliffsNotes version --

42:57.534 --> 42:59.399
I will help you
across the river.

43:26.813 --> 43:30.021
Now, put your arm
around my neck.

43:31.693 --> 43:34.105
Okay, not so tight.
You will drown us both.

43:37.824 --> 43:38.654
Whoo!

43:48.001 --> 43:49.332
You're kidding.

43:49.544 --> 43:51.455
What kind of teeth?

43:52.214 --> 43:55.877
[Trot] When I get out of here,
I'm gonna look up your sister.

43:57.344 --> 44:00.006
'Cause you know
I'm getting out of here.

44:00.222 --> 44:01.428
Will Balint's death

44:01.640 --> 44:02.971
was officially declared
an accident.

44:03.225 --> 44:05.307
How about we officially declare
you a rapist?

44:05.519 --> 44:07.726
They don't seem to be faring
too well these days.

44:07.938 --> 44:09.223
[door closes]

44:09.856 --> 44:12.268
You two, my office.

44:22.828 --> 44:26.070
So, Mathias
finally convinced Sam Poteet

44:26.289 --> 44:28.280
to take off the bandage.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.873
Wasn't a bullet wound.

44:31.086 --> 44:32.371
What was it?

44:32.587 --> 44:33.918
Linda bit him.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.080
Which syncs up
with the report I got

44:37.300 --> 44:39.131
from the Super 8 in Billings.

44:39.344 --> 44:41.960
Linda left with a man
who claimed to be her brother,

44:42.180 --> 44:44.762
and she did not go quietly.

44:45.892 --> 44:50.602
So, given the missing gun
and the missing person...

44:51.815 --> 44:53.430
that leaves Gab.

44:54.276 --> 44:57.143
Except that Laila was sure
that it was a man she saw.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.478
Maybe she made a mistake.

44:59.698 --> 45:01.029
It was dark.

45:01.241 --> 45:03.277
She was probably traumatized.

45:03.493 --> 45:05.358
Or maybe she knew it was Gab

45:05.579 --> 45:07.661
and she lied
just to throw us off the scent.

45:08.415 --> 45:10.827
Both Gab and Laila
had reason to hate Tyler.

45:11.835 --> 45:14.827
You said there was a blood trail
leading to a car.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.422
Gab doesn't have a car.

45:16.631 --> 45:18.212
Maybe she had help.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.833
It's also possible

45:22.053 --> 45:25.591
that someone other than
Sam Poteet is the new Hector.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.202
I thought you knew where to go.

45:54.419 --> 45:55.374
I do.

45:56.671 --> 45:58.332
More or less.

46:00.550 --> 46:02.632
-Are we lost?
-Of course not.

46:04.221 --> 46:06.587
But I may not be
at my absolute sharpest.

46:08.058 --> 46:09.889
Henry, we should go back.

46:10.727 --> 46:12.388
You need a doctor.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.141
We cannot go back.

46:17.567 --> 46:18.943
The good news

46:19.152 --> 46:20.858
is that we are going to see
a medicine woman.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.156
Here you go.

46:35.377 --> 46:36.958
Uh, Victoria Moretti?

46:37.170 --> 46:39.206
She left about 20 minutes ago.

46:39.422 --> 46:40.923
I think her husband
picked her up.

46:41.967 --> 46:43.832
-Her husband?
-Yeah.

46:44.052 --> 46:47.510
Uh, as long as I'm here,
could you page Dr. Weston?

46:47.722 --> 46:49.303
-Sure.
-Thank you.

46:52.394 --> 46:54.100
-[woman] Okay.
-[receiver hangs up]

46:54.312 --> 46:55.427
The doctor's with a patient.

46:55.647 --> 46:57.353
Would you like to wait?

46:57.565 --> 46:58.520
I'll be right over there.

46:58.733 --> 47:00.189
Okay.

47:09.744 --> 47:10.779
Cookies for dinner?

47:10.996 --> 47:12.782
Oh. No, dessert.

47:12.998 --> 47:14.829
Dinner was Cheez-lts.

47:15.041 --> 47:16.201
[chuckles]

47:16.418 --> 47:17.999
Coffee or tea?

47:18.211 --> 47:19.246
Uh, tea, please.

47:21.214 --> 47:22.499
Tea.

47:23.925 --> 47:25.210
Thanks.

47:25.427 --> 47:28.339
So, how's your, uh,
gunshot victim?

47:28.555 --> 47:30.716
Not sure.
Still waiting to find out.

47:30.932 --> 47:33.344
I could, uh,
sure use a few words with him.

47:35.562 --> 47:37.143
How's your patient?

47:37.355 --> 47:39.391
Uh, good. We, uh --

47:39.607 --> 47:41.563
We finally got to talk
about an hour ago.

47:41.776 --> 47:45.610
It's just
a very complicated situation.

47:46.364 --> 47:47.695
How's it complicated?

47:48.867 --> 47:50.403
Well [clears throat]

47:50.618 --> 47:56.204
Well, my patient's suicide,
uh, it was because of me.

48:05.342 --> 48:06.502
So, what happened?

48:08.178 --> 48:10.294
Have you ever heard
of transference?

48:11.931 --> 48:14.183
Is that when your patient
falls in love with you?

48:15.060 --> 48:16.516
More or less, yeah.

48:18.229 --> 48:20.265
Occupational hazard, I suppose.

48:20.482 --> 48:21.892
I don't know.

48:22.108 --> 48:24.724
Any of your suspects
ever fall for you?

48:24.944 --> 48:26.320
Hope so.

48:27.781 --> 48:28.896
[chuckles]

48:30.367 --> 48:33.450
Hey, um, I thought
I might see you here,

48:33.661 --> 48:36.243
so I brought you something.

48:36.456 --> 48:38.242
John Donne.

48:41.753 --> 48:45.746
No, I didn't. l-l-I said
I had to read him in college.

48:45.965 --> 48:47.000
Oh.

48:48.426 --> 48:49.632
Give it back.

48:51.096 --> 48:53.678
No, it's mine.
You just gave it to me.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.554
You know,
you didn't have to pick me up.

49:02.774 --> 49:05.982
Oh, no, l was on my way over
already. I, uh, got an update.

49:06.194 --> 49:08.185
All of Walker's crew
is accounted for.

49:08.405 --> 49:09.861
I either I.D.'d them
from the bonfire

49:10.073 --> 49:11.984
or they were on duty, so...

49:12.200 --> 49:13.815
no one left to be
in the woods.

49:14.035 --> 49:15.536
Except, of course,
Walker Browning.

49:17.330 --> 49:20.538
You know,
it's possible that, um --

49:20.750 --> 49:22.957
that Gab was waiting for Tyler
in the woods.

49:23.169 --> 49:24.579
Oh, really?

49:24.796 --> 49:26.332
You think
the rape victim did it?

49:26.548 --> 49:27.708
Maybe.

49:29.551 --> 49:31.087
Listen,
we can talk about this inside.

49:31.302 --> 49:32.803
You've come all this way,
and the least I can do

49:32.971 --> 49:34.427
is make you a home-cooked meal.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.056
Okay.

49:43.523 --> 49:44.478
Thank you.

49:44.649 --> 49:45.684
Sure.

49:51.406 --> 49:56.617
80, um,
I have a confession to make.

49:57.787 --> 49:58.867
What's that?

49:59.164 --> 50:02.372
Um, there's no food
in the house.

50:03.418 --> 50:05.329
And this isn't my house.

50:52.759 --> 50:54.624
-[pounding on door]
-Open the goddamn door.

50:54.844 --> 50:57.460
I know you've been following me.
Open the door.

51:02.185 --> 51:03.015
Monte?

51:20.119 --> 51:23.532
What, is this because Walt
didn't give you the job, huh?

51:27.210 --> 51:28.165
Are you some kind
of Lee Harvey Oswald?

51:28.378 --> 51:29.993
No, I'm not.

51:30.213 --> 51:34.126
But I know all about you.
Walt Longmire hired a nut case.

51:34.342 --> 51:36.253
Just one more example
of his questionable judgment.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.338
Hey, you can't touch that!

51:43.810 --> 51:45.926
[laughs]

51:46.145 --> 51:48.682
You're going down --
you and your boss.

51:48.898 --> 51:50.229
You have no idea what's coming!

51:50.441 --> 51:52.227
Well, you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.308
Pack up your shit, Monte,
or else.

51:57.448 --> 51:59.188
You heard that, right?
He just threatened me.

51:59.409 --> 52:00.740
You heard that, right?

52:10.837 --> 52:11.997
[camera shutter clicks]

52:12.797 --> 52:14.458
[Donna]
You should get a cellphone.

52:16.843 --> 52:19.755
Because they exist
and they're convenient.

52:22.140 --> 52:23.346
I like not getting phone calls.

52:23.558 --> 52:25.970
[laughs]
No kidding.

52:26.185 --> 52:27.595
Do you have any idea
how many messages

52:27.812 --> 52:30.098
-|'ve left with Ruby?
-A couple.

52:30.315 --> 52:31.270
I can see how hard
you're working

52:31.482 --> 52:34.064
to find who killed my man.

52:34.277 --> 52:35.733
Shot, you mean.

52:35.945 --> 52:38.231
No, killed. He coded upstairs
ten minutes ago.

52:41.826 --> 52:44.067
Was there anybody with you?

52:44.287 --> 52:46.243
Any witnesses?

52:46.456 --> 52:47.662
You just wait
till you were all alone

52:47.874 --> 52:49.489
so you could finish the job?

52:49.709 --> 52:51.040
[chuckles]
You serious?

52:51.586 --> 52:54.328
-You own a Snake Slayer pistol?
-Don't make this about me.

52:54.547 --> 52:56.538
You locked up an innocent man,
got another man killed.

52:56.758 --> 52:58.373
You think I'm gonna sit back
and do nothing

52:58.593 --> 53:00.458
in the face
of your recklessness...

53:01.304 --> 53:02.714
you don't know me.

53:13.191 --> 53:14.647
[Donna]
He's got some issues.

53:17.320 --> 53:18.309
Yeah.

53:19.864 --> 53:20.694
I got to go.

53:20.907 --> 53:23.364
Um, there's something

53:23.576 --> 53:25.282
I've been in denial about
all day.

53:25.495 --> 53:26.655
I got to go deal with it, so...

53:26.871 --> 53:28.452
I understand, yeah.

53:28.665 --> 53:29.700
Okay.

53:34.003 --> 53:34.992
Hey.

53:36.255 --> 53:37.165
[CadYI
Hey.

53:37.382 --> 53:38.588
ls Henry around?

53:39.425 --> 53:42.337
Uh, no. He has the night off.
What's up?

53:42.553 --> 53:44.384
I need to talk to Gab Langton.

53:44.597 --> 53:46.212
l was hoping
he'd know where she is.

53:46.432 --> 53:47.968
| just saw her this morning.

53:48.184 --> 53:49.640
You saw her this morning?

53:49.852 --> 53:50.637
Yeah.

53:52.188 --> 53:53.769
Why are you looking for her?

53:54.565 --> 53:56.180
Well, I didn't want
to believe it at first,

53:56.401 --> 53:59.393
but, um, she's become one
of my primary suspects

53:59.612 --> 54:01.477
in the murder of Tyler Malone.

54:03.032 --> 54:05.739
Oh, my God.
He's dead, too?

54:05.952 --> 54:08.364
Yeah.
Shot in the woods last night.

54:08.579 --> 54:10.570
Just died at the hospital.

54:10.790 --> 54:12.246
Where'd you see Gab?

54:13.960 --> 54:15.871
Walking on the Res.

54:16.087 --> 54:18.578
-Where was she headed?
-I don't know.

54:18.798 --> 54:20.334
She with anybody?

54:21.759 --> 54:22.999
No.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.180
[Walt]
Thanks, Pumpkin.

54:46.409 --> 54:48.070
It's going to get dark soon.

54:52.457 --> 54:54.288
[Henry]
I believe we are here.

54:58.087 --> 54:59.702
It is a medicine wheel.

55:03.176 --> 55:04.416
I know what it is.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.221
When I was nine,
I went to see one of these

55:11.434 --> 55:13.015
with my mom and my grandma.

55:15.521 --> 55:17.352
They were like you.

55:18.441 --> 55:20.102
They thought
it was some big deal.

55:21.694 --> 55:23.605
To me,
it was just a bunch of rocks.

55:25.490 --> 55:27.276
So I kicked one of the rocks.

55:29.035 --> 55:31.868
Ever since then,
nothing in my life's been good.

55:33.456 --> 55:37.369
Gab, what happened to you
was not your fault.

55:39.086 --> 55:41.293
And medicine wheels
do not bring bad luck.

55:42.089 --> 55:43.829
-They are places of healing.
{gunshoﬂ

55:47.220 --> 55:48.960
Stop!

55:49.806 --> 55:52.218
I have been shot at enough
for one day!

55:53.392 --> 55:57.852
lam Henry Standing Bear,
and this is Gabriella Langton!

55:58.064 --> 56:00.271
We know that
a powerful Crow medicine woman

56:00.483 --> 56:01.598
guards this place.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.476
And we need her help!

56:13.579 --> 56:16.366
Okay, you got one minute...

56:17.625 --> 56:19.866
to explain to me
why I shouldn't shoot you.

56:25.383 --> 56:27.169
We've come from
the Cheyenne reservation --

56:28.052 --> 56:29.417
Your minute's up.
