00:35.444 --> 00:37.905
Easy, son. This ice is delicate.

00:37.988 --> 00:41.200
Amazing.
Isn't this exciting, Shiro?

00:41.283 --> 00:44.662
You guys get a little more excited
about ice samples than I do.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.497
<i>[man] This is history in the making.</i>

00:46.580 --> 00:50.000
<i>Not only have we traveled farther
than any human ever has,</i>

00:50.084 --> 00:52.357
<i>but this ice could
hold microscopic clues</i>

00:52.358 --> 00:54.630
<i>about the existence
of life outside Earth.</i>

00:54.713 --> 00:57.945
Think of it, Dad.
We could use those clues to become

00:57.946 --> 01:01.178
- the first people to meet aliens.
- My life's work would be complete.

01:02.555 --> 01:04.765
<i>[man] What is that?
Seismic activity?</i>

01:04.766 --> 01:06.976
<i>[Shiro] We should
get back to the ship.</i>

01:07.935 --> 01:10.187
<i>[man] What? What is that?</i>

01:11.397 --> 01:13.524
<i>It can't be.</i>

01:15.901 --> 01:17.987
Run! Come on, run!

<i>X-9-Y as ordered when we found
these primitive scientists.</i>

01:32.001 --> 01:33.752
I don't think they know anything useful.

01:33.836 --> 01:37.381
<i>Take them back
to the main fleet for interrogation.</i>

01:37.464 --> 01:41.343
<i>The druids will find out what they know.</i>

01:41.427 --> 01:44.972
Please, we come from a peaceful planet!
W-We mean you no harm!

01:45.055 --> 01:47.433
We're unarmed!
[groans]

01:51.854 --> 01:54.482
<i>[male voice] Look, they
brought in another one.</i>

01:54.565 --> 01:56.525

- Over there. It's another one.</i>

01:56.609 --> 01:57.610
Huh?

02:20.799 --> 02:24.094
[groans]
Lance, can you keep this thing straight?

02:24.178 --> 02:26.505
Relax, Hunk, I'm just
getting a feel for the stick.

02:26.506 --> 02:29.767
I mean it's not like I did this!
[groans]

02:29.850 --> 02:31.560
Or this!
[groans]

02:31.644 --> 02:33.562
Okay, unless you want
to wipe beef stroganoff

02:33.646 --> 02:36.315
out of all the little nooks
and crannies in this thing,

02:36.398 --> 02:38.025
you'd better knock it off, man!

02:38.108 --> 02:39.693
We've picked up a distress beacon!

02:39.777 --> 02:41.946
All right, look alive, team!
Pidge, track coordinates.

02:42.029 --> 02:42.905
Copy.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.074
Knock it off, Lance! Please!
[computer beeping]

02:45.157 --> 02:48.869
This one's on you, buddy.
We've got a hydraulic stabilizer out.

02:48.953 --> 02:51.205
[rumbling]
[gulps]

02:51.288 --> 02:53.874
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no. Fix now, puke later.

02:53.958 --> 02:57.044
I lost contact. The shaking
is interfering with our sensors.

02:57.127 --> 03:00.381
- Come on, Hunk!
- It's not responding. [moans]

03:01.757 --> 03:03.383
Never mind, fellas. Thar she blows.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.553
- Preparing for approach on visual.
- I don't think that's advisable

03:06.637 --> 03:10.391
with our current mechanical
and gastrointestinal issues.

03:10.474 --> 03:11.308
Agreed.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.728
Stop worrying.
This baby can take it, can't you, champ?

03:14.812 --> 03:18.023
[rumbling] See? She was nodding.
She was nodding.

03:18.107 --> 03:21.485
Pidge, hail down to them
and let them know their ride is here.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.570
Attention, lunar vessel... [screams]
[rumbling]

03:23.654 --> 03:25.301
What are you doing? Buckle your belt.

03:25.302 --> 03:30.953
- And, Hunk, stop that shaking!
- I'm try... Oh, no. [vomits]

03:31.036 --> 03:32.204
Attention, lunar vessel,

03:32.288 --> 03:35.958
this is Galaxy Garrison Rescue Craft
One Victor Six Three Tango.

03:36.041 --> 03:40.379
Coming in for landing and extraction,
against crew recommendations.

03:40.462 --> 03:42.172
No time for your mutinous comments now.

03:42.173 --> 03:43.882
They're going under and we're going in.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.510
- Look out for that overhang!
- No worries.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.138
My first year in flight school,
know what they called me?

03:49.221 --> 03:52.099
They called me "The Tailor"
because of how I thread the needle.

03:52.182 --> 03:54.977
Come around, come around!
Come on, come on!

03:55.060 --> 03:56.979
[computer beeping]
We lost a wing!

03:57.062 --> 04:00.024
Oh, man.
[beeping continues]

04:00.107 --> 04:01.400
[loud crash]

04:01.525 --> 04:03.527
<i>[computer voice] Simulation failed.</i>

04:03.611 --> 04:05.362
Nice work, Tailor.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.948
Roll out, donkeys!

04:08.032 --> 04:10.284
Well, let's see if we can't use
this complete failure

04:10.367 --> 04:12.286
<i>as a lesson for the rest of you students.</i>

04:12.369 --> 04:14.475
<i>Can anyone point out the mistakes these</i>

04:14.476 --> 04:16.582
<i>three so-called cadets
made in the simulator?</i>

04:16.665 --> 04:20.418
- The engineer puked in the main gearbox.
- Yes. As everyone knows,

04:20.502 --> 04:24.465
vomit is not an approved lubricant
for engine systems. What else?

04:24.548 --> 04:26.258
The comm spec removed
his safety harness.

04:26.342 --> 04:28.308
- The pilot crashed!
- Correct.

04:28.343 --> 04:31.055
And worst of all, the whole jump,
they're arguing with each other.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.307
Heck, if you're going to be
this bad individually,

04:33.390 --> 04:36.060
you'd better at least be able
to work as a team!

04:36.143 --> 04:39.188
Galaxy Garrison exists to turn
young cadets like you

04:39.271 --> 04:42.733
into the next generation
of elite astroexplorers,

04:42.816 --> 04:44.360
but these kinds of mental mistakes

04:44.443 --> 04:47.571
are exactly what cost the lives
of the men on the Kerberos Mission.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.906
That's not true, sir!

04:48.989 --> 04:51.762
- What did you say? Sorry, sir.
- I think he hit his head

04:51.763 --> 04:54.536
when he fell out of his chair.
But point taken.

04:54.620 --> 04:57.998
I hope I don't need to remind you
that the only reason you're here

04:58.082 --> 05:02.294
is that the best pilot in your class had
a discipline issue and flunked out.

05:02.378 --> 05:05.302
Don't follow in his footsteps.

05:06.048 --> 05:07.424
Next!

05:11.637 --> 05:15.724
<i>Lights out in five!
Everyone back to their dorms, now.</i>

05:15.808 --> 05:17.267
[Hunk] We shouldn't be doing this.

05:17.351 --> 05:20.479
You heard Commander Iverson.
We need to bond as a team.

05:20.562 --> 05:24.441
We're going to grab Pidge, hit the town,
loosen up, meet some nice girls...

05:24.525 --> 05:28.320
Okay, I'm just saying this here, right
now, on the record. This is a bad idea.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.199
You know, for someone
in a space exploration program,

05:32.282 --> 05:34.451
you don't have much
of a sense of adventure.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.580
All of your little adventures end up
with me in the principal's office.

05:44.002 --> 05:46.088
Oh, man.

05:48.424 --> 05:50.426
<i>[guard speaks into radio]

05:52.845 --> 05:54.638

05:59.810 --> 06:01.011
[screams]
[thud]

06:01.437 --> 06:02.813
I'm fine.

06:04.273 --> 06:05.482
[Hunk yelps]

06:09.987 --> 06:11.613
Where is he going?

06:14.158 --> 06:20.539
[faint electronic beeping,
voice murmuring]

06:20.622 --> 06:23.292
You come up here to rock out?
[gasps]

06:23.375 --> 06:28.297
Oh, Lance, Hunk.
No, um, just looking at the stars.

06:28.380 --> 06:31.175
Where'd you get this stuff?
It doesn't look like Garrison tech.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.677
- I built it.
- You built all of this?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.495
- Hey!
- Stop it! With this thing,

06:35.496 --> 06:38.098
I can scan all the way to
the edge of the solar system.

06:38.182 --> 06:41.143
That right?
All the way to Kerberos?

06:42.019 --> 06:44.438
You go ballistic every time
the instructors bring it up.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.356
- What's your deal?
- Second warning, Hunk!

06:46.440 --> 06:47.274
[groans]

06:47.357 --> 06:51.361
Look, Pidge, if we're going to bond
as a team, we can't have any secrets.

06:51.445 --> 06:55.240
Fine. The world as you know it
is about to change.

06:55.324 --> 06:59.578
The Kerberos Mission wasn't lost because
of some malfunction or crew mistake.

06:59.661 --> 07:01.580
[yelling] Stop touching my equipment!

07:01.663 --> 07:02.748
[groans]

07:03.790 --> 07:07.878
So, I've been scanning the system
and picking up alien radio chatter.

07:07.961 --> 07:12.716
- Whoa. What? Aliens?
- Okay. So, you're insane. Got it.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.221
I'm serious. They keep repeating
one word, "Voltron."

07:17.304 --> 07:20.474
And tonight, it's going crazier
than I have ever heard it.

07:20.557 --> 07:21.558
How crazy?

07:21.642 --> 07:24.394
<i>[Iverson over PA] Attention, students.
This is not a drill.</i>

07:24.478 --> 07:28.148
<i>We are on lockdown!
Security situation Zulu Niner.</i>

07:28.232 --> 07:32.319
<i>Repeat: all students are to remain
in barracks until further notice.</i>

07:32.402 --> 07:35.322
What's going on?
Is that a meteor?

07:36.532 --> 07:40.077
A very, very big meteor?

07:41.787 --> 07:44.540
- It's a ship. [yelps]
- Holy crow!

07:44.623 --> 07:47.501
<i>I can't believe what I'm seeing!
That's not one of ours.</i>

07:47.584 --> 07:49.837
No. It's one of theirs.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.256
So, wait.
There really are aliens out there?

08:02.349 --> 08:06.603
- We've got to see that ship!
- Hunk, come on!

08:06.687 --> 08:10.274
Oh, this is the worst
team-building exercise ever.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.778
[electronic beeping]

08:14.862 --> 08:17.865
<i>[Lance] Whoa!
What the heck is that thing?</i>

08:19.992 --> 08:21.910
<i>- And who the heck is she?
- [Pidge] Lance!</i>

08:21.994 --> 08:25.153
<i>[blow landing]
[Lance] Ow! Right, alien ship.</i>

08:25.188 --> 08:27.708
Man, we'll never get past all
of those guards to get a look.

08:27.791 --> 08:30.632
Aw, man.Yeah, yeah,
I guess there's nothing

08:30.667 --> 08:32.379
to do but head back
to the barracks, right?

08:32.462 --> 08:36.424
Wait. They set up a camera in there
and I grabbed its feed. Look!

08:36.508 --> 08:38.677
<i>- Hey! What are you doing?
- [Iverson] Calm down, Shiro.</i>

08:38.760 --> 08:41.638
<i>We just need to keep you quarantined
until we run some tests om you.</i>

08:41.722 --> 08:45.559
<i>You have to listen to me!
They destroy worlds! [grunts]</i>

08:45.642 --> 08:47.895
<i>Aliens are coming!
[grunts]</i>

08:47.978 --> 08:50.314
That's Shiro!
The pilot of the Kerberos Mission!

08:50.397 --> 08:51.648
That guy's my hero!

08:51.732 --> 08:55.110
- I guess he's not dead in space, after all.
- Where's the rest of the crew?

08:55.193 --> 08:57.696
<i>[Iverson] Do you know how long
you've been gone?</i>

08:57.779 --> 09:02.034
I don't know. Months? Years?
Look, there's no time.

09:02.117 --> 09:05.954
Aliens are coming here for a weapon.
They're probably on their way.

09:06.038 --> 09:09.041
They'll destroy us.
We have to find Voltron.

09:09.124 --> 09:11.543
- Voltron!
- [man] Sir, take a look at this.

09:11.627 --> 09:14.671
<i>It appears his arm has been replaced
with a cyborg prosthetic.</i>

09:14.755 --> 09:16.131
<i>[Iverson] Put him under until we know</i>

09:16.132 --> 09:17.507
<i>- what that thing can do.
- No. No. No...</i>

09:17.591 --> 09:19.509
Don't put me under!
No! There's no time!

09:19.593 --> 09:21.762
They didn't ask
about the rest of the crew.

09:21.845 --> 09:23.534
What are they doing? The guy's a legend.

09:23.535 --> 09:25.223
They're not even gonna listen to him?

09:25.307 --> 09:28.936
- We have to get him out.
- Uh, I hate to be the voice of reason, always,

09:29.019 --> 09:32.856
but weren't we watching on TV because
there was no way to get past the guards?

09:32.940 --> 09:35.233
That was before
we were properly motivated.

09:35.317 --> 09:36.968
We've just got to think.

09:36.969 --> 09:38.070
Could we tunnel in?

09:38.153 --> 09:41.281
Maybe we could get some hazmat suits
and sneak in like med techs.

09:41.365 --> 09:44.180
Or we dress up like cooks,
head back to the dorms,

09:44.181 --> 09:46.995
sneak into the commissary...
little late-night snack.

09:47.079 --> 09:49.581
No. What we need is a distraction.

09:49.665 --> 09:51.375
[all scream]

09:51.458 --> 09:53.376
Is that the aliens? Is that the aliens?

09:53.377 --> 09:55.295
Are they here? They got here so quick!

09:55.379 --> 09:58.799
No, those explosions
were a distraction, for him.

09:58.882 --> 10:03.220
<i>The Garrison's headed toward the blast,
and he's sneaking in from the other side.</i>

10:04.554 --> 10:07.557
No way! Oh, he is not going
to beat us in there!

10:07.641 --> 10:09.559
That guy is always trying to one-up me!

10:09.643 --> 10:10.769
- Who is it?
- Keith!

10:10.852 --> 10:12.479
- Who?
- Are you sure?

10:12.562 --> 10:15.399
<i>- Oh, I'd recognize that mullet anywhere!
- Who's Keith?</i>

10:19.945 --> 10:22.364
<i>[man] These readings are off the chart.</i>

10:23.865 --> 10:24.700
<i>[man] Hey!</i>

10:25.575 --> 10:28.495
[blows landing, men groaning]

10:34.835 --> 10:36.169
[groans]

10:37.337 --> 10:38.338
Shiro?

10:41.174 --> 10:44.594
Nope. No, you... No, no, no.
No, you don't. I'm saving Shiro.

10:44.678 --> 10:48.648
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Uh, the name's Lance.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.477
We were in the same class
at the Garrison.

10:52.561 --> 10:55.921
- Really? Are you an engineer?
- No, I'm a pilot!

10:55.956 --> 10:58.191
We were, like, rivals. You know,
Lance and Keith, neck and neck.

10:58.275 --> 11:01.403
Oh, wait. I remember you.
You're a cargo pilot.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.948
Well, not anymore. I'm fighter
class now, thanks to you washing out.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.825
Well, congratulations.

11:09.327 --> 11:12.164
Oh, man. They're coming back
and they do not look happy.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.331
We've got to go.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.586
Uh, do you mind
if we catch a ride with you?

11:18.712 --> 11:22.424
[yells] Is this thing going
to be big enough for all of us?

11:22.507 --> 11:23.341
No.

11:28.555 --> 11:31.349
- Why am I holding this guy?
- Hey, we did all fit.

11:33.018 --> 11:34.603
<i>[Lance] Can't this thing go any faster?</i>

11:34.686 --> 11:37.189
We could toss out
some non-essential weight.

11:37.272 --> 11:38.565
Oh, right!

11:39.441 --> 11:43.403
- Okay, so that was an insult. I get it.
- Big man, lean left!

11:43.487 --> 11:44.905
<i>[all] Whoa!</i>

11:46.531 --> 11:49.881
[Hunk] Aw, man! Mr. Harris just
wiped out Professor Montgomery!

11:49.916 --> 11:53.038
- No, no. He's fine.
- Big man, lean right!

11:53.121 --> 11:55.123
[all screaming]

12:02.589 --> 12:04.591
Guys? [stammers]
Is that a cliff up ahead?

12:04.674 --> 12:06.468
<i>[Lance] Oh, no, no, no!</i>

12:06.551 --> 12:09.221
- Yup.
- No, no, no!

12:09.304 --> 12:13.225
[all screaming]

12:14.309 --> 12:17.062
<i>[Lance] What are you doing?
You're going to kill us all!</i>

12:17.145 --> 12:18.355
Shut up and trust me!

12:31.535 --> 12:35.080
- It's good to have you back.
- It's good to be back.

12:35.163 --> 12:39.000
So, what happened out there?
Where were you?

12:40.001 --> 12:44.506
I wish I could tell you.
My head's still pretty scrambled.

12:44.589 --> 12:48.844
I was on an alien ship,
but somehow I escaped.

12:48.927 --> 12:50.929
It's all a blur.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.975
How did you know to come save me
when I crashed?

12:56.184 --> 12:58.520
You should come see this.

13:04.568 --> 13:08.405
- [Shiro] What have you been working on?
- [Keith] I can't explain it, really.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.282
After getting booted from the Garrison,

13:10.365 --> 13:14.452
I was kind of lost and found myself
drawn out to this place.

13:14.536 --> 13:18.582
It's like something... some energy,
was telling me to search.

13:19.708 --> 13:23.712
- For what?
- Well, I didn't really know at the time...

13:23.713 --> 13:28.008
until I stumbled across this
area. It's an outcropping of

13:28.009 --> 13:32.304
giant boulders with caves
covered in these ancient markings.

13:32.387 --> 13:35.557
Each tells a slightly different story
about a blue lion,

13:35.640 --> 13:38.977
but they all share clues
leading to some event,

13:39.060 --> 13:41.897
some arrival happening last night.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.024
Then, you showed up.

13:45.233 --> 13:48.820
I should thank you all
for getting me out. Lance, right?

13:54.784 --> 13:56.912
The nervous guy's Hunk.
I'm Pidge.

13:56.995 --> 13:59.414
So, did anyone else
from your crew make it out?

14:00.373 --> 14:03.585
I'm not sure. I remember the
mission and being captured.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.587
After that, it's just bits and pieces.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.798
Yeah, sorry to interrupt, but back
to the aliens. Where are they now?

14:08.882 --> 14:10.696
Are they coming? Are they coming for us?

14:10.697 --> 14:12.510
Like where are they at this very moment?

14:12.594 --> 14:17.390
I can't really put it together.
I remember the word "Voltron."

14:17.474 --> 14:20.810
It's some kind of weapon they're
looking for, but I don't know why.

14:20.894 --> 14:24.022
Whatever it is, I think we need
to find it before they do.

14:24.105 --> 14:27.567
Well, last night, I was rummaging through
Pidge's stuff, and I found this picture.

14:27.651 --> 14:28.860
Look, it's his girlfriend.
[chuckles]

14:28.944 --> 14:31.613
Hey, give me that!
What were you doing in my stuff?

14:31.696 --> 14:33.385
I was looking for a candy bar.

14:33.386 --> 14:35.992
- But, then, I started reading his diary.
- What?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.954
And I noticed the repeating series of
numbers the aliens are searching for

14:39.037 --> 14:41.998
- looks a lot like a Fraunhofer line.
- Frown who?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.334
It's a number describing
the emission spectrum of an element,

14:44.417 --> 14:47.587
only, this element doesn't exist on Earth.
I thought it might be this Voltron.

14:47.671 --> 14:50.507
And I think I can build a
machine to look for it, like

14:50.508 --> 14:53.343
- a Voltron Geiger counter.
- Hunk, you big, gassy genius!

14:53.426 --> 14:56.680
It's pretty fascinating, really.
The wavelength looks like this.

14:56.763 --> 14:57.973
Give me that!

15:12.153 --> 15:15.448
Okay, I admit it.
This is super freaky.

15:15.532 --> 15:19.244
I'm getting a reading.
[electronic beeping]

15:24.582 --> 15:25.917
[beeping continues]

15:27.502 --> 15:28.753
[beeping intensifies]

15:33.925 --> 15:35.468
Whoa.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.933
- Whoa.
- What are these?

15:42.017 --> 15:44.936
<i>These are the lion carvings
I was telling you about.</i>

15:45.020 --> 15:46.646
<i>They're everywhere around here.</i>

15:46.730 --> 15:47.939
Hmm.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.485
Whoa. Whoa!

15:52.569 --> 15:56.364
<i>- What?
- They've never done that before.</i>

15:58.742 --> 16:01.870
[all screaming]

16:01.953 --> 16:03.079
[screaming]

16:12.505 --> 16:16.343
<i>[gasps]
They are everywhere.</i>

16:18.511 --> 16:23.224
- Is this it? Is this the Voltron?
- It must be.

16:23.308 --> 16:26.478
This is what's been causing
all of this crazy energy out here.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.775
<i>Looks like there's
a force field around it.</i>

16:32.984 --> 16:35.653
Does anyone else get the feeling
this is staring at them?

16:36.571 --> 16:37.405
No.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.743
Yeah. The eyes are totally following me.

16:51.628 --> 16:53.755
I wonder how we get through this.

16:54.589 --> 16:56.424
Maybe you just have to knock.

16:57.759 --> 16:59.052
[yells]

17:03.223 --> 17:04.891
[both yelling]

17:16.819 --> 17:18.988
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

17:19.071 --> 17:21.199
Uh, did everyone just see that?

17:21.281 --> 17:25.494
Voltron is a robot. Voltron
is a huge, huge, awesome robot!

17:25.578 --> 17:27.642
And this thing is only one part of it!

17:27.643 --> 17:29.707
I wonder where the rest of them are.

17:29.791 --> 17:33.044
- This is what they're looking for.
- Incredible.

17:35.547 --> 17:38.216
[Pidge and Hunk scream]

17:45.515 --> 17:46.558
Hmm.

17:47.183 --> 17:48.435
[chuckles]

17:49.727 --> 17:53.273
Huh. Hmmph.
Mmm... hmm.

17:55.066 --> 17:56.568
Here we go.

17:56.651 --> 17:58.278
[screams, groans]

17:59.195 --> 18:00.822
Uh? Huh.

18:03.324 --> 18:04.784
<i>[Lance laughs]
[Pidge and Hunk] Whoa.</i>

18:04.868 --> 18:06.411
<i>[Lance] All right! Very nice!</i>

18:06.494 --> 18:10.123
Okay, guys, I feel the need to point out,
just so that we're all aware.

18:10.206 --> 18:13.793
We are in some kind of
futuristic alien cat head right now.

18:13.877 --> 18:17.130
[deep purring]

18:17.213 --> 18:19.799
- Whoa. Did you guys just hear that?
- Hear what?

18:19.883 --> 18:21.968
I think it's talking to me.

18:22.051 --> 18:23.928
Hmm... Um...

18:26.681 --> 18:28.933
[roars]
[Pidge and Hunk scream]

18:29.017 --> 18:31.394
Okay. Got it.
Now, let's try this.

18:44.908 --> 18:46.534
[Pidge and Hunk screaming]

18:47.911 --> 18:51.706
<i>[Keith] You are the worst pilot ever!</i>

18:53.333 --> 18:56.628
[screaming continues]

18:56.711 --> 19:00.116
<i>[Iverson] What in the Sam Hill is that?</i>

19:00.215 --> 19:03.343
It appears to be a flying blue lion, sir.

19:12.227 --> 19:15.188
Isn't this awesome?
Make it stop. Make it stop.

19:15.271 --> 19:18.066
I'm not making it do anything.
It's like it's on autopilot.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.817
<i>- [Keith] Where are you going?
- [Lance] I said it's on autopilot! </i>

19:22.852 --> 19:24.697
<i>It says there's an alien
ship approaching Earth.</i>

19:24.781 --> 19:28.409
- I think we're supposed to stop it.
- What did it say, exactly?

19:28.493 --> 19:30.261
It's not like it's saying words.

19:30.262 --> 19:32.914
It's more like feeding
ideas into my brain, kind of.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.166
If this thing is the weapon
they're coming for,

19:35.250 --> 19:39.087
why don't we just, I don't know, give it
to them? Maybe they'll leave us alone.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.756
- Sorry, lion. Nothing personal.
- You don't understand.

19:41.839 --> 19:44.175
These monsters spread
like a plague throughout the galaxy,

19:44.259 --> 19:46.302
destroying everything in their path.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.221
There's no bargaining with them.

19:48.222 --> 19:50.056
They won't stop until
everything is dead.

19:51.349 --> 19:53.643
Oh. Never mind then.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.979
[roars]

20:05.780 --> 20:07.240
[all gasp]
[Hunk] Uh...

20:07.323 --> 20:10.034
Holy crow!
Is that really an alien ship?

20:14.664 --> 20:16.749
They found me.

20:18.543 --> 20:20.962
- We've got to get it out of here!
- Hang on!

20:21.588 --> 20:24.841
[all shouting]

20:26.843 --> 20:29.262
All right. Okay,
I think I know what to do.

20:29.345 --> 20:31.681
Be careful, man.
This isn't a simulator.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.392
<i>[Lance] Well, that's good.
I always wreck the simulator.</i>

20:40.982 --> 20:42.400
Let's try this.

20:51.159 --> 20:52.118
<i>[Shiro] Nice job, Lance.</i>

20:52.201 --> 20:55.204
<i>[Lance] Okay. I think it's time to get
these guys away from our planet.</i>

20:55.288 --> 20:58.625
Lord Zarkon, the escaped prisoner
and his people found the lion.

20:58.708 --> 21:01.127
It attacked us
and is heading out of the system.

21:01.210 --> 21:05.214
<i>Follow that lion and alert all ships
in the area to intercept.</i>

21:05.298 --> 21:09.218
<i>Capturing that lion
is your first and only priority.</i>

21:09.302 --> 21:11.220
Yes, Your Majesty.

21:11.221 --> 21:13.139
<i>Full power after the lion!</i>

21:13.931 --> 21:16.851
<i>- [Hunk] Oh, no!
- [Pidge] They're gaining on us.</i>

21:16.934 --> 21:20.313
<i>[Lance] It's weird. They're not trying
to shoot us. They're just chasing.</i>

21:20.396 --> 21:23.524
<i>[Hunk] Okay, seriously, now we think
having aliens follow us is good?</i>

21:23.608 --> 21:26.653
I am not on board
with this new direction, guys.

21:26.736 --> 21:27.904
Where are we?

21:27.987 --> 21:32.158
<i>[Shiro] Edge of the solar system.
There's Kerberos.</i>

21:32.241 --> 21:35.119
<i>[Pidge] It takes months for our ships
to get out this far.</i>

21:35.203 --> 21:37.413
<i>We got out here in five seconds.</i>

21:38.581 --> 21:41.474
<i>- [Hunk] What is that?
- [Lance] This may seem crazy, </i>

21:41.509 --> 21:44.045
<i>but I think the lion wants
us to go through there.</i>

21:44.796 --> 21:47.674
- Where does it go?
- I-I don't know.

21:47.757 --> 21:51.469
Shiro, you're the senior officer here.
What should we do?

21:51.552 --> 21:54.597
Whatever is happening,
the lion knows more than we do.

21:54.681 --> 21:59.602
I say we trust it, but we're a team now.
We should decide together.

22:03.648 --> 22:06.602
All right. Guess we're all
ditching class tomorrow.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.495
[all groaning]

22:21.999 --> 22:24.794
Whoa. That was...

22:24.877 --> 22:27.797
[grunts, vomits]

22:27.880 --> 22:30.425
- So sorry.
- I'm just surprised it took this long.

22:30.508 --> 22:33.678
I don't recognize
any of these constellations.

22:33.761 --> 22:36.681
We must be a long,
long way from Earth.

22:36.764 --> 22:40.059
<i>[Lance] The lion seems to want
to go to this planet. I think...</i>

22:40.143 --> 22:41.561
<i>I think it's going home.</i>

23:02.665 --> 23:05.751
Guys, personal space.
Hunk, your breath is killing me.

23:05.835 --> 23:08.754
Um, is it just me or is anyone else
having second thoughts

23:08.838 --> 23:10.381
about flying through
a mysterious wormhole?

23:10.465 --> 23:12.633
Why are we listening
to a robotic lion anyway?

23:12.717 --> 23:15.136
It got us away
from that alien warship, didn't it?

23:15.219 --> 23:18.764
I don't know if you noticed,
but we're in an alien warship.

23:18.848 --> 23:22.685
- Oh, are you scared?
- With you at the helm? Terrified.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.687
All right, knock it off.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.648
No one's happy to be in this
situation, but we're here now.

23:27.732 --> 23:30.860
If we want to get through this,
we've got to do it together.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.153
So, what do we do?

23:33.154 --> 23:36.491
First, we find out where
we're headed. Lance?

23:36.574 --> 23:37.992
I don't know.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.195
I'm sorry. The lion's
not talking to me anymore.

23:41.196 --> 23:42.580
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Shh!

23:42.663 --> 23:44.916
Listen. I think I hear something.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.459
[passing gas]
I'm hearing it, too.

23:46.542 --> 23:49.420
It's, uh... It's kind of a...
a high-pitched squeal?

23:49.504 --> 23:50.505
[all groan]

23:50.588 --> 23:54.675
- Come on, Lance!
- But seriously, there's a castle up ahead.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.845
<i>[all] Wow.</i>

24:20.618 --> 24:22.995
- Keep your guard up.
- Something wrong?

24:23.079 --> 24:25.247
My crew was captured by aliens once.

24:25.248 --> 24:27.416
<i>I'm not going to let it happen again.</i>

24:29.418 --> 24:30.294
[all gasp]

24:30.419 --> 24:32.838
<i>[Hunk] Oh, no!
I knew it was going to eat us! No!</i>

24:32.922 --> 24:34.298
[roars]

24:36.467 --> 24:38.010
[Hunk whimpers]

24:44.308 --> 24:49.105
Oh, the door is open.
Guess I was wrong about you.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.239
Hello?

24:58.322 --> 25:00.116
[voice echoing]

25:02.743 --> 25:06.372
<i>[Pidge] From the size of the lion,
I expected these steps to be bigger.</i>

25:08.416 --> 25:11.877
<i>[all gasp]
[computer] Hold for identity scan.</i>

25:11.961 --> 25:13.296
[Pidge] What?

25:13.379 --> 25:16.340
Why are we here?
What do you want with us?

25:22.388 --> 25:24.765
<i>Whoa!</i>

25:26.601 --> 25:28.811
<i>[Pidge] I guess we're going that way.</i>

25:30.938 --> 25:32.231
<i>[Hunk] Hello?</i>

25:32.356 --> 25:34.066
[voice echoing]

25:36.777 --> 25:38.362
<i>[Hunk] Hello?</i>

25:42.783 --> 25:45.786
<i>- [Hunk] Hello?
- [Lance] Where are we?</i>

25:47.204 --> 25:50.166
It's some kind of control room.

25:50.791 --> 25:51.626
[gasps]

26:02.261 --> 26:04.847
Are these guys... dead?

26:10.936 --> 26:12.855
[gasps]
Father!

26:18.694 --> 26:20.196
Hello.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.240
Who are you? Where am I?

26:23.324 --> 26:26.786
I'm Lance.
And you're right here in my arms.

26:26.869 --> 26:28.287
Your ears.

26:29.622 --> 26:30.539
Yeah?

26:31.499 --> 26:34.460
They're hideous.
What's wrong with them?

26:34.543 --> 26:35.544
Nothing's wrong with them!

26:35.628 --> 26:38.172
They heard exactly what you said
about them! [screams]

26:38.255 --> 26:40.069
Who are you? Where is King Alfor?

26:40.070 --> 26:41.884
What are you doing in my castle?

26:41.967 --> 26:44.637
A giant blue lion brought us here.
That's all we know.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.159
How do you have the Blue Lion?

26:46.160 --> 26:47.598
What happened to its paladin?

26:47.682 --> 26:50.768
<i>What are you all doing here? Unless...</i>

26:51.602 --> 26:54.480
- How long has it been?
- We don't know what you're talking about.

26:54.563 --> 26:57.441
Why don't you tell us who you are?
Maybe we can help.

26:58.526 --> 27:00.736
I am Princess Allura of Planet Altea.

27:00.820 --> 27:05.658
I've got to find out where we are
and how long we've been asleep.

27:05.741 --> 27:08.244
Okay, that's how that works.

27:12.707 --> 27:14.291
[gasps, screams]

27:14.417 --> 27:17.294
Enemy combatants!
[grunts, groans]

27:17.378 --> 27:18.295
[screams]

27:18.379 --> 27:21.882
Quiznak! You're lucky I have a case
of the old "sleep chamber knees."

27:22.007 --> 27:25.052
Otherwise, I'd grab your head like this,
wrap you up like so...

27:25.136 --> 27:27.596
one, two, three...
[snaps fingers] sleepy time!

27:27.680 --> 27:30.933
Well, before you did that, I'd...
[grunts repeatedly]

27:31.016 --> 27:33.368
- like that.
- Oh, really? How could you do that

27:33.369 --> 27:35.396
when I've already come at you with this?

27:35.479 --> 27:36.856
[grunting]
Ha, ha, ha, hey!

27:37.022 --> 27:39.275
Man, these guys are good.
[computer beeping]

27:39.358 --> 27:40.693
It can't be.

27:40.776 --> 27:45.114
- What is it?
- We've been asleep for 10,000 years.

27:50.119 --> 27:51.328
Zarkon.

27:51.454 --> 27:56.167
<i>Your fleet has been destroyed, Alfor.
I will be there shortly to claim Voltron.</i>

27:57.585 --> 27:59.211
[all grunt]

28:00.546 --> 28:04.508
Father, we must form Voltron
and fight before it's too late!

28:04.592 --> 28:08.304
It's already too late.
We must send the lions away.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.890
We can't risk them
falling into Zarkon's hands.

28:10.973 --> 28:14.518
- We can't give up hope!
- I'm sorry, daughter.

28:14.602 --> 28:17.855
If all goes well,
I will see you again soon.

28:20.149 --> 28:22.651
- Father!
- I love you.

28:23.694 --> 28:28.949
Planet Altea and all of the planets
in our solar system have been destroyed.

28:29.033 --> 28:33.370
Coran, Father is gone.
Our entire civilization...

28:34.038 --> 28:35.289
Zarkon.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.208
[gasps]

28:37.291 --> 28:40.711
- Zarkon?
- He was the King of the Galra.

28:40.795 --> 28:44.507
A vile creature
and enemy to all free people.

28:44.590 --> 28:48.344
I remember now...
I was his prisoner.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.347
He's still alive?
Impossible!

28:51.430 --> 28:53.808
I can't explain it, but it's true.

28:53.891 --> 28:56.435
He's searching for a super
weapon called Voltron.

28:56.519 --> 29:00.856
He's searching for it because he knows
it's the only thing that can defeat him,

29:00.940 --> 29:04.610
and that's exactly
why we must find it before he does.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.825
[moans]
Ah...

29:13.786 --> 29:16.588
The Blue Lion has returned,

29:16.589 --> 29:20.793
and now I feel a
resurgence of Altean energy.

29:20.918 --> 29:24.463
Alfor's daughter lives? How?

29:24.547 --> 29:30.469
I know not, but it is time to reclaim
what is rightfully ours.

29:30.553 --> 29:36.267
[Zarkon] Yes. I shall wipe that foul race
from the universe forever

29:36.350 --> 29:41.730
and take back Voltron.
Contact my commanders.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.618
<i>[male voice] Emperor
Zarkon requests an audience.</i>

29:56.078 --> 30:01.000
<i>Commander Sendak, the Princess of Altea
is alive and hiding in your sector.</i>

30:01.083 --> 30:05.087
<i>We believe she alone holds
the whereabouts of the remaining lions.</i>

30:05.212 --> 30:08.424
<i>Your battle fleet
is the closest to her location.</i>

30:08.507 --> 30:10.509
<i>Retrieve her and the lions.</i>

30:10.634 --> 30:14.597
<i>With them all,
the Galra Empire will be unstoppable.</i>

30:14.680 --> 30:18.726
I fight for the empire.
I conquer in the name of Galra.

30:18.851 --> 30:23.856
No foe has ever stood in my way
and none ever will.

30:23.939 --> 30:24.940
<i>Vrepit sa!</i>

30:26.775 --> 30:28.444
Set a course for Arus.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.740
<i>[Coran] Princess, you must eat.
It's been 10,000 years.</i>

30:32.865 --> 30:34.366
I'm not hungry.

30:34.450 --> 30:37.786
Man, 10,000 years?
That's like one thousand plus ten.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.664
- That's times ten.
- Whatever, dropout.

30:40.748 --> 30:43.083
I haven't eaten since breakfast
and I'm starving.

30:43.167 --> 30:45.252
Yeah, but you've thrown up,
like, five times.

30:45.336 --> 30:49.340
- Hmm, good point.
- I can't believe your civilization

30:49.341 --> 30:53.344
created such advanced
technology 10,000 years ago.

30:53.427 --> 30:55.596
It must have been an
incredible place. [groans]

30:55.679 --> 31:02.144
Yes, it was... but now it is gone
and we're the last Alteans alive.

31:06.941 --> 31:09.485
[sobbing softly]

31:09.568 --> 31:12.655
[squeaking]
[gasps]

31:12.780 --> 31:14.365
[squeaking]

31:16.200 --> 31:18.661
Looks like we're not the last, after all.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.036
[alarm blaring]
[gasps]

31:25.292 --> 31:27.711
<i>[Coran] A Galra battleship
has set its tracker to us!</i>

31:27.795 --> 31:29.546
How did they find us?

31:29.630 --> 31:31.924
I'm not sure,
but I bet it's Keith's fault.

31:32.007 --> 31:34.760
Say whatever you've got to say
to make yourself feel better.

31:34.843 --> 31:37.680
After getting us stuck
on the other side of a wormhole!

31:37.805 --> 31:39.348
I'll stick you in a wormhole!

31:39.431 --> 31:41.850
Stow it, cadets!
This is no time to place blame.

31:41.934 --> 31:45.354
It's time to work as a team.
How long before they arrive?

31:45.437 --> 31:48.065
At their speed? Oh,
well, carry the two...

31:48.066 --> 31:50.693
I'd say probably a couple of days.

31:50.818 --> 31:53.070
Good. Let them come!

31:53.195 --> 31:57.533
<i>By the time they get here,
you five will have reformed Voltron,</i>

31:57.616 --> 32:00.869
<i>and together, we will destroy
Zarkon's empire!</i>

32:00.953 --> 32:02.621
[burps]

32:02.705 --> 32:04.415
Sorry. Food goo.

32:04.498 --> 32:05.791
[stomach rumbles]
[groans]

32:05.874 --> 32:09.420
Princess, there are five of these lions.
How are we going to find the rest?

32:10.212 --> 32:11.422
[mice squeak]

32:15.551 --> 32:19.263
[Coran] King Alfor connected the lions
to Allura's life force.

32:19.346 --> 32:22.057
She alone is the key
to the lions' whereabouts.

32:24.268 --> 32:25.477
<i>[all] Whoa!</i>

32:26.228 --> 32:28.522
These are coordinates.

32:28.647 --> 32:32.192
The Black Lion looks like it's in
the same location as the Blue Lion.

32:32.276 --> 32:35.571
Look at your primitive synapses
firing away in their little brain cage.

32:35.654 --> 32:40.117
Very observant. That's because
the Black Lion is in the castle.

32:40.242 --> 32:42.494
To keep the Black Lion
out of Zarkon's hands,

32:42.578 --> 32:44.288
King Alfor locked it in the castle.

32:44.371 --> 32:47.291
It can only be freed if the
other four lions are present.

32:47.374 --> 32:50.878
As you have found,
the lions choose their pilots.

32:50.961 --> 32:54.089
It is a mystical bond
and cannot be forced.

32:54.173 --> 32:58.052
<i>The quintessence of the pilot
is mirrored in his lion.</i>

32:58.177 --> 33:02.181
<i>Together, they form something
greater than science can explain.</i>

33:03.015 --> 33:06.518
The Black Lion
is the decisive head of Voltron.

33:06.602 --> 33:11.732
<i>It will take a pilot who is a born leader
and in control at all times,</i>

33:11.815 --> 33:15.444
<i>someone whose men will follow
without hesitation.</i>

33:15.569 --> 33:19.740
<i>That is why, Shiro,
you will pilot the Black Lion.</i>

33:19.823 --> 33:22.826
The Green Lion has
an inquisitive personality

33:22.910 --> 33:26.080
<i>and needs a pilot
of intellect and daring.</i>

33:26.205 --> 33:29.375
<i>Pidge, you will pilot the Green Lion.</i>

33:29.458 --> 33:31.955
- The Blue Lion...
- Whoa, hold up, let me guess.

33:31.990 --> 33:34.797
Takes the most handsome
slash best pilot of the bunch?

33:35.923 --> 33:40.010
The Yellow Lion is caring and kind.

33:40.094 --> 33:43.222
Its pilot is one who puts
the needs of others above his own.

33:43.305 --> 33:45.682
His heart must be mighty.

33:45.808 --> 33:50.062
<i>As the leg of Voltron, you will lift
the team up and hold them together.</i>

33:50.145 --> 33:51.146
[grunts questioningly]

33:51.230 --> 33:55.609
The Red Lion is temperamental
and the most difficult to master.

33:55.692 --> 34:00.406
It's faster and more agile than
the others, but also more unstable.

34:00.489 --> 34:05.953
Its pilot needs to be someone who relies
more on instincts than skill alone.

34:06.036 --> 34:08.664
<i>Keith, you will fly the Red Lion.</i>

34:08.746 --> 34:10.666
What? This guy?

34:10.748 --> 34:14.962
Unfortunately, I cannot locate
the Red Lion's coordinates yet.

34:15.045 --> 34:16.964
There must be something wrong
with the castle.

34:17.047 --> 34:20.426
After 10,000 years,
it might need some work.

34:20.509 --> 34:22.094
Don't worry, we'll find it soon.

34:22.177 --> 34:24.847
They don't call me
"The Coranic" for nothing.

34:24.929 --> 34:28.891
It's because it sounds like "mechanic."
So... Coranic, mechanic.

34:28.976 --> 34:32.103
It's not... It doesn't sound...
exactly like it. It's similar.

34:32.187 --> 34:33.981
[roars]

34:34.063 --> 34:35.149
[both gasp]

34:37.650 --> 34:41.612
<i>[Allura] Once all the lions are united,
you will form Voltron,</i>

34:41.737 --> 34:46.577
the most powerful warrior ever known,
the Defender of the Universe.

34:48.745 --> 34:49.746
<i>[Hunk] Awesome!</i>

34:49.830 --> 34:51.955
- [Pidge] Oh...
- Wait.

34:51.989 --> 34:55.005
Okay, we're going to be in there
and flying lions. Got that part.

34:55.041 --> 34:57.671
How do lions turn into legs?
Also, is this going to be a long trip?

34:57.754 --> 34:59.673
'Cause I have to pee.
Do you people pee?

34:59.756 --> 35:03.135
We don't have much time.
Pidge and I will go after the Green Lion.

35:03.218 --> 35:05.387
<i>Lance, you take Hunk
and get the yellow one.</i>

35:05.471 --> 35:09.475
Keith, you stay here.
If you locate that Red Lion, go get it.

35:09.558 --> 35:12.936
In the meantime,
I'll get this castle's defenses ready.

35:13.061 --> 35:14.605
They'll be sorely needed.

35:14.688 --> 35:18.525
I'll ready a pod and load the coordinates
so that you can reach the Green Lion.

35:32.873 --> 35:35.834
<i>[Coran] We can only keep the wormholes
that lead to the other lions</i>

35:35.918 --> 35:39.588
<i>open for two of your Earth hours, so
you'll have to be quick about your work.</i>

35:39.671 --> 35:41.840
<i>The good news
is that according to my readings,</i>

35:41.924 --> 35:43.509
<i>both planets are relatively peaceful.</i>

35:43.592 --> 35:46.261
So, if you do get stuck,
they could be relaxing places

35:46.345 --> 35:48.680
to live out the rest of your lives.

35:48.764 --> 35:50.766
- Enjoy the trip!
- [Lance] Wait! What? No!

35:50.849 --> 35:53.352
<i>[Hunk] I did not
receive the memo on this.</i>

36:04.029 --> 36:05.781
[electronic beeping]

36:14.122 --> 36:15.123
Look!

36:19.461 --> 36:21.505
[both gasp]
[moans]

36:21.588 --> 36:24.841
[electronic beeping]
It's just a...

36:26.093 --> 36:28.262
whatever that thing is.

36:32.849 --> 36:34.226
[moans]

36:35.018 --> 36:38.564
I... I think he wants us
to get in his canoe.

36:38.647 --> 36:40.899
- Then I guess we should go.
- Huh.

36:41.024 --> 36:44.444
I've been locked up by aliens
for a year. This is nothing.

36:50.158 --> 36:53.328
[squeaking]

37:00.502 --> 37:01.920
[Pidge chuckles]

37:07.050 --> 37:10.429
I wonder if Hunk and Lance are
having as good a time as us.

37:10.512 --> 37:11.805
[screaming]
[alarm blaring]

37:11.930 --> 37:15.934
[Hunk] Oh, no!
No, no, no! Oh! Oh, no!

37:16.018 --> 37:17.644
[screaming continues]

37:18.020 --> 37:19.438
[rapid beeping]

37:19.521 --> 37:20.731
[slow beeping]

37:24.526 --> 37:28.030
[both grunting]

37:28.155 --> 37:30.198
[both screaming]

37:30.282 --> 37:32.951
<i>[Hunk] I thought Coran said
these planets were peaceful!</i>

37:33.035 --> 37:35.537
Maybe "peaceful" means
something else in Altean!

37:45.631 --> 37:50.636
[groaning] According to the coordinates,
we're right on top of the Yellow Lion.

37:50.719 --> 37:52.554
It's below there,
where they're mining for the ore.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.264
They don't even know the lion is there.

37:54.348 --> 37:56.725
Or maybe they just got here
and they're digging for the lion?

37:56.808 --> 37:59.061
- What do you think, Lance?
- Who cares? Just go get it!

37:59.144 --> 38:02.481
- I'm dropping you down there.
- Me? Down there? No. No, no, no.

38:02.564 --> 38:03.857
Yes, I'll cover you!

38:11.406 --> 38:14.660
What if the Yellow Lion doesn't work?
What if I can't get in the mine?

38:14.743 --> 38:16.870
What if I start crying?
Too late. I'm already crying!

38:16.953 --> 38:18.372
Sorry, no time for questions.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.667
[screaming]

38:22.668 --> 38:26.421
[groaning]

38:26.505 --> 38:27.506
[grunts]

38:33.845 --> 38:36.973
Oh, yeah, sure, just drop me off
in an alien planet. That's cool, man.

38:37.099 --> 38:40.477
It's only occupied by mean purple aliens
that want to kill me, but whatever.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.814
Just ignore them and go connect
with a big, yellow, mechanical cat.

38:43.897 --> 38:44.898
Easy-peasy. Yeah.

38:44.981 --> 38:47.818
That all makes a ton of sense to me.
[machine whirring]

38:55.659 --> 38:56.702
Cool.

39:00.789 --> 39:04.209
[panting]

39:06.336 --> 39:10.841
[groans] Okay, I'm in a giant hole.
Now what, Hunk?

39:12.509 --> 39:13.719
Huh?

39:16.304 --> 39:18.223
Whoa. Pretty.

39:19.224 --> 39:24.438
How am I going to get through that?
Hmm? Hmm...

39:25.439 --> 39:26.523
[Lance grunts]

39:29.109 --> 39:30.902
[electronic beeping]

39:32.028 --> 39:33.280
[grunts]

39:46.168 --> 39:48.462
[gasps]

39:56.344 --> 39:58.346
Oh, no!
[grunts]

40:09.733 --> 40:10.734
Hunk!

40:15.906 --> 40:19.117
<i>I know the Princess said this is supposed
to be my lion, but what if she's wrong?</i>

40:19.201 --> 40:20.702
I mean she's probably not wrong.
She's a princess,

40:20.786 --> 40:23.705
but I'm not a pilot, even though
I've always wanted to be a pilot.

40:23.789 --> 40:26.583
I read all the fighter manuals,
but never got to fly the simulator.

40:26.666 --> 40:29.294
But hey, I can't be that worse
than Lance. He crashed all the time.

40:29.377 --> 40:31.129
<i>What if I get in there
and it doesn't respond?</i>

40:31.213 --> 40:34.174
<i>What if I get in there and it's too big
and my feet don't touch the pedals?</i>

40:34.257 --> 40:37.969
- What if there aren't even pedals?
- You're rambling. Listen...

40:38.053 --> 40:41.848
our commander on the Kerberos Mission
is the smartest man I ever met,

40:41.973 --> 40:45.977
<i>and he always said, "If you get
too worried about what could go wrong,</i>

40:46.061 --> 40:48.814
<i>you might miss a chance
to do something great."</i>

40:50.065 --> 40:51.441
[gasps]

41:03.078 --> 41:05.288
[creature moaning]

41:22.764 --> 41:24.724
Go. Be great.

41:39.781 --> 41:41.533
[panting]

41:42.784 --> 41:43.910
Uh?

41:49.541 --> 41:51.209
[growling]
Uh?

41:55.964 --> 41:57.007
[grunts]

41:58.049 --> 41:59.968
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

42:00.051 --> 42:02.178
[Green Lion roaring]
[grunts]

42:12.188 --> 42:15.400
Hunk, come on! Please, buddy!
[screams]

42:20.071 --> 42:22.908
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Going down! We're going down!

42:22.991 --> 42:24.075
[grunts]

42:30.790 --> 42:32.000
[electricity crackling]

42:34.961 --> 42:37.964
[alarm blaring]

42:38.048 --> 42:39.424
Oh, no.

42:56.733 --> 42:58.068
[electricity crackling]

42:58.151 --> 42:59.861
<i>[Hunk] You okay, Lance?</i>

43:00.612 --> 43:02.163
Hunk! I thought you were dead!

43:02.164 --> 43:04.491
You jumped in front of
those shots to save my life!

43:04.574 --> 43:06.993
<i>Well, actually, I was trying
to get out of the way.</i>

43:07.077 --> 43:10.455
<i>Thankfully, what this lacks in speed,
it more than makes up for in armor.</i>

43:10.538 --> 43:12.786
<i>Man, can it take a beating!
Ooh.</i>

43:13.416 --> 43:14.793
<i>[Hunk] We've got incoming!</i>

43:15.418 --> 43:19.422
<i>Paladins, please hurry back.
I can't hold the wormhole much longer.</i>

43:19.506 --> 43:20.757
Let's get out of here!

43:25.095 --> 43:29.015
[grunts, groans]

43:29.099 --> 43:31.977
[groans]
Not this again.

43:32.102 --> 43:34.896
<i>[Lance] Quit screwing around, Hunk!
The wormhole is closing!</i>

43:38.775 --> 43:39.776
[electronic beeping]

43:42.112 --> 43:44.030
[both groaning]

43:45.240 --> 43:46.992
You made it.

43:47.117 --> 43:49.285
Yeah, just barely.
That was a nightmare.

43:49.369 --> 43:51.538
I almost puked out there.
I felt like Hunk!

43:51.621 --> 43:53.449
Think how I felt.
I am Hunk.

43:53.484 --> 43:56.126
Yeah. We had a tough time, too.

43:57.043 --> 43:58.753
Did we find the Red Lion yet?

43:58.837 --> 44:03.133
Allura just located it.
There's a bit of good news and bad news.

44:03.216 --> 44:05.760
The good news is,
the Red Lion's nearby.

44:05.844 --> 44:09.514
The bad news is, it's on board
that Galra ship now orbiting Arus.

44:10.432 --> 44:12.976
But wait, good news again.
We're Arus!

44:13.059 --> 44:14.394
They're here already?

44:14.477 --> 44:17.689
Yes. Guess my calculations
were a bit off.

44:17.772 --> 44:20.859
Finger counting... it's more of an art
than a science. Hmm?

44:22.652 --> 44:26.322
<i>Princess Allura, this is Commander Sendak
of the Galra Empire.</i>

44:26.448 --> 44:30.243
<i>I come on behalf of Emperor Zarkon,
Lord of the Known Universe.</i>

44:30.326 --> 44:33.079
<i>I am here to confiscate the lions.</i>

44:33.163 --> 44:37.250
<i>Turn them over to me,
or I will destroy your planet.</i>

44:40.712 --> 44:43.076
- All right, let's not panic.
- Not panic?

44:43.111 --> 44:46.634
The scary purple alien thing
is driving his battleship toward us.

44:46.718 --> 44:49.929
- We only have four lions.
- Technically, only three working lions.

44:50.013 --> 44:51.556
That's right. Thank you, Pidge.

44:51.639 --> 44:55.310
Three working lions and a castle
that's, like, 10,000 years old.

44:55.393 --> 45:00.106
Actually, it's 10,600 years old.
You see, it was built by my grandfather...

45:00.190 --> 45:02.129
Thanks, Coran. Thank you for that.

45:02.130 --> 45:04.068
See? Now is the perfect time to panic!

45:04.152 --> 45:07.864
Wait! This castle has a
particle barrier we can activate.

45:07.947 --> 45:10.950
- Girl, you've already activated my par...
- Lance!

45:12.368 --> 45:14.996
<i>[Coran] The particle barrier won't hold
Sendak's ion cannon forever.</i>

45:15.622 --> 45:18.291
The Galra technology must have
advanced since we fought them last.

45:18.374 --> 45:20.647
- Panic now?
- No. We've just got to figure out

45:20.648 --> 45:22.921
our plan of action, and
figure it out quickly.

45:23.004 --> 45:25.715
I say we pop through a wormhole
and live to fight another day.

45:25.799 --> 45:28.384
I second that. Yes.
We tried to find all the lions, right?

45:28.468 --> 45:30.595
We gave it the old college try.
Couldn't do it.

45:30.678 --> 45:32.430
We only have three.
We can't form Voltron.

45:32.514 --> 45:34.682
I guess we could form a snake.
Or a worm!

45:34.766 --> 45:37.143
To go through that hole, Lance,
that you were talking about.

45:37.227 --> 45:38.228
Then, it's settled.

45:38.311 --> 45:42.190
Allura, you ride with me.
One of you take the old guy.

45:42.273 --> 45:45.526
We can't just abandon Arus.
The Galra will keep destroying

45:45.527 --> 45:48.029
planets and capturing prisoners
until we stop them.

45:48.112 --> 45:50.573
Okay. If we run, then
maybe Sendak will follow us

45:50.574 --> 45:53.034
and leave this planet alone,
like when we left Earth.

45:53.117 --> 45:56.037
We form the snake-worm thingamajig
and we... [hisses] out of here.

45:56.120 --> 45:59.249
Sendak could destroy the planet
then come after us anyway.

45:59.332 --> 46:01.000
Staying is our only option.

46:01.084 --> 46:03.169
Here's an option: shut your quiznak.

46:03.253 --> 46:05.088
I don't think you're using
that word correctly.

46:05.171 --> 46:06.464
What do you know, Mullet?

46:06.548 --> 46:08.174
- We're staying.
- Leaving!

46:08.258 --> 46:09.676
- Staying!
- Snake!

46:09.759 --> 46:12.950
Guys, stop!
Princess Allura, these are your lions.

46:12.951 --> 46:14.806
You've dealt with the
Galra Empire before.

46:14.889 --> 46:17.308
You know what we're facing
better than any of us.

46:17.392 --> 46:20.228
<i>What do you think
is the best course of action?</i>

46:20.311 --> 46:22.272
I... I don't know.

46:23.189 --> 46:27.402
- Perhaps your father can help.
- My father?

46:30.280 --> 46:32.490
Coran, what is this?

46:32.574 --> 46:35.785
<i>King Alfor knew there was a chance
he might never see you again.</i>

46:35.869 --> 46:37.975
<i>So, his memories, his very being,</i>

46:37.976 --> 46:40.081
<i>were stored in this computer for you.</i>

46:45.086 --> 46:46.004
[gasps]

46:56.055 --> 47:00.685
Father...
Father, it is so good to see you.

47:00.768 --> 47:06.024
<i>Allura, my only child,
how I've missed your face.</i>

47:08.151 --> 47:09.569
I'm so frightened.

47:10.320 --> 47:14.157
A Galra ship is set to attack,
and I don't know what to do.

47:14.240 --> 47:16.910
Please, Father, I need your help.

47:16.993 --> 47:20.622
<i>I would do anything
to take this burden from you.</i>

47:20.705 --> 47:24.167
I don't know if we should run
to preserve what we have

47:24.250 --> 47:26.961
or stay and risk everything.

47:27.045 --> 47:30.757
I want to fight,
but the paladins of old are gone.

47:31.549 --> 47:33.009
I know what you would do.

47:33.092 --> 47:37.889
<i>I scattered the Lions of Voltron
to keep them out of Zarkon's hands.</i>

47:37.972 --> 47:40.016
<i>You urged me to keep them and fight,</i>

47:40.099 --> 47:42.810
<i>but, for the greater good
of protecting the universe,</i>

47:42.894 --> 47:44.938
<i>I chose to hide them.</i>

47:45.021 --> 47:46.564
I think I understand.

47:46.648 --> 47:49.651
<i>No, daughter, you were right.</i>

47:49.734 --> 47:51.861
<i>I made a terrible mistake,</i>

47:51.945 --> 47:55.114
<i>one that cost the universe
countless lives.</i>

47:55.198 --> 47:59.827
<i>Forming Voltron
is the only way to stop Zarkon.</i>

47:59.911 --> 48:03.331
<i>You must be willing
to sacrifice everything</i>

48:03.414 --> 48:07.126
<i>to assemble the lions
and correct my error.</i>

48:10.463 --> 48:13.549
You five paladins were
brought here for a reason.

48:14.384 --> 48:18.596
<i>The Voltron Lions are meant to be
piloted by you and you alone.</i>

48:19.180 --> 48:23.601
We must fight and keep fighting
until we defeat Zarkon.

48:23.685 --> 48:25.311
It is our destiny.

48:25.395 --> 48:29.148
<i>Voltron is the universe's only hope.</i>

48:29.232 --> 48:32.485
<i>We are the universe's only hope.</i>

48:33.194 --> 48:35.321
We're with you, Princess.

48:37.991 --> 48:39.742
<i>[Allura] Your suits of armor.</i>

48:46.082 --> 48:47.333
- Cool!
- Outstanding.

48:47.417 --> 48:48.751
- Nice.
- Oh, neat!

48:48.835 --> 48:49.836
Hmm...

48:51.045 --> 48:52.547
Mmm... hmm.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.632
Princess, are you sure about this?

48:54.716 --> 48:57.969
They aren't exactly the best and
brightest the universe has to offer.

48:58.052 --> 49:00.722
No, but they're all we've got.

49:00.805 --> 49:03.016
Boys, it's time to suit up!

49:15.069 --> 49:18.990
The bayard is the traditional weapon
of the Paladins of Voltron.

49:19.073 --> 49:21.826
It takes a distinct shape
for each paladin.

49:22.368 --> 49:24.162
[gasps, groans]

49:24.245 --> 49:25.621
[grunts]

49:28.082 --> 49:29.125
[gasps]

49:31.961 --> 49:34.338
[laughs]
Whoo!

49:36.340 --> 49:38.217
[grunting]

49:39.510 --> 49:41.763
Aw, you got a cute little bayard...

49:41.846 --> 49:45.224
[screams, groans]
Yeah, it is pretty cute.

49:46.017 --> 49:49.562
Shiro, I'm afraid your bayard
was lost with its paladin.

49:49.645 --> 49:51.564
I guess I'll just have to make do.

49:52.398 --> 49:55.068
[Allura] You'll need to retrieve
the Red Lion from Sendak's ship.

49:55.151 --> 49:58.738
That's a pretty big ship. How are
we gonna know where the Red Lion is?

49:58.821 --> 50:01.199
It's not a matter of "we."
It's a matter of "you."

50:01.282 --> 50:03.034
Pidge is right. Once we get you in,

50:03.117 --> 50:05.495
you'll be able to feel its presence
and track it down.

50:05.578 --> 50:08.915
Yeah. You know how you felt that
crazy energy while we were in the desert?

50:08.998 --> 50:12.206
- Yeah. You made fun of me for that.
- And I'm proud of that,

50:12.241 --> 50:14.545
but turns out it's exactly
like that mumbo-jumbo.

50:14.629 --> 50:18.216
Keith, remember, the Red Lion
is extremely temperamental.

50:18.299 --> 50:19.967
You'll have to earn its respect.

50:22.428 --> 50:24.847
All right.
Here's our plan of attack.

50:26.599 --> 50:29.268
<i>[Shiro] The Galra Empire knows
about the Blue and Yellow Lion,</i>

50:29.352 --> 50:31.896
<i>but they don't know
we have the Green Lion, too.</i>

50:34.398 --> 50:38.402
<i>Hunk, Lance, you'll act as a decoy
by pretending to give yourselves up.</i>

50:38.486 --> 50:41.989
<i>Attention, Galra ship. Do not fire.
We're surrendering our lions.</i>

50:46.494 --> 50:48.287
Hope this works.

50:48.371 --> 50:49.580
<i>[Shiro] While Sendak is distracted,</i>

50:49.664 --> 50:52.708
<i>Keith, Pidge, and I will sneak
onto the ship in the Green Lion.</i>

50:52.792 --> 50:55.920
<i>Keith and I will find the Red Lion
while Pidge guards our exit.</i>

50:56.003 --> 50:58.714
<i>Hunk, Lance, find some way
to take down that ion cannon.</i>

51:01.300 --> 51:02.552
Pidge, what's your ETA?

51:04.053 --> 51:05.179
We're in.

51:07.682 --> 51:09.684
Activate tractor beam.

51:12.270 --> 51:13.271
What's that thing?

51:13.354 --> 51:15.773
I think that's our signal
to get out of here!

51:19.527 --> 51:22.613
They lied to us.
Launch fighters!

51:26.284 --> 51:29.912
Hunk, you dismantle the ion cannon
while I take these jerks on a space ride!

51:29.996 --> 51:30.997
Ten-four!

51:51.184 --> 51:53.561
[groans, panting]

51:53.644 --> 51:56.367
I've been here before.
After I was taken

51:56.402 --> 51:59.358
by the Galra cruiser off
Kerberos, they brought us here.

51:59.442 --> 52:03.112
So, that means your other crewmembers,
they might be held captive here.

52:03.196 --> 52:06.143
- We... We've got to rescue them.
- Pidge, we don't have time.

52:06.178 --> 52:08.910
We have to get
the Red Lion and get back to Arus.

52:08.993 --> 52:10.953
But we can't just leave prisoners here!

52:11.037 --> 52:13.122
Look, no one understands that
more than me,

52:13.206 --> 52:15.833
but, in war, we have
to make hard choices.

52:15.917 --> 52:19.212
- Now, let's get moving.
- No!

52:19.795 --> 52:21.464
Commander Holt is my father.

52:21.547 --> 52:24.675
He and my brother were the ones
on the Kerberos Mission with you.

52:24.759 --> 52:27.557
- Commander Holt is your father?
- Yes.

52:27.592 --> 52:29.055
I've been searching everywhere
for him and my brother.

52:29.138 --> 52:32.516
And I'm not going to give up looking
when I'm this close. I won't!

52:32.600 --> 52:34.018
<i>[Shiro] I'm coming with you.</i>

52:34.101 --> 52:34.936
What?

52:35.019 --> 52:38.564
I remember where the prisoners are held.
Keith, you go find the Red Lion.

52:38.648 --> 52:41.734
- By myself?
- Minor change of plans. You'll be fine.

52:41.817 --> 52:43.903
Just remember, patience yields focus.

52:43.986 --> 52:46.405
[doors open]
So... run!

52:46.906 --> 52:48.616
[panting]

52:50.952 --> 52:53.829
Great. Now, which way?

52:59.502 --> 53:01.963
[footsteps approaching]

53:04.090 --> 53:05.132
[grunts]

53:09.679 --> 53:13.307
What the quiznak?
What is that? A force field?

53:14.850 --> 53:16.769
<i>[Allura] Particle barrier up!</i>

53:20.648 --> 53:22.566
Is that what's supposed to happen?

53:24.610 --> 53:26.737
All the barrier crystals
are out of alignment.

53:26.821 --> 53:28.406
We have to fix it immediately.

53:28.489 --> 53:31.284
Without the particle barrier,
we'll be defenseless.

53:31.367 --> 53:33.703
We're both too big.
What can we do?

53:33.786 --> 53:35.579
[mice squeaking]

53:35.663 --> 53:38.416
- The mice!
- How do they know how to do this?

53:38.499 --> 53:42.712
[Allura] I can hear them talking to me.
I think our minds are connected.

53:43.629 --> 53:47.383
<i>It must be from sharing
the sleep pod for 10,000 years.</i>

53:48.676 --> 53:51.012
[squeaking]

53:51.762 --> 53:54.306
Thank you, friends.

53:54.307 --> 53:56.851
[grunting, straining]

53:56.934 --> 53:58.769
Coran, what are you doing?

53:58.853 --> 54:01.689
I'm trying to get them
to make me a sandwich.

54:08.696 --> 54:10.781
[groans]

54:11.324 --> 54:13.159
You've got to be kidding me!

54:13.951 --> 54:16.912
[breathing heavily]

54:16.996 --> 54:19.123
Patience yields focus.

54:26.255 --> 54:27.465
Gotcha.

54:30.676 --> 54:31.719
<i>[Pidge] Huh?</i>

54:36.807 --> 54:39.602
<i>[Shiro] That thing saw us.
We should get out of here.</i>

54:39.685 --> 54:42.146
<i>Wait.
I think this might come in handy.</i>

54:42.772 --> 54:45.316
Now, I'll just reset the controls...

54:45.775 --> 54:47.777
and it's working for us.

54:49.570 --> 54:51.989
I'm going to call you "Rover."
Follow me!

54:56.285 --> 54:57.453
Open up.

55:00.831 --> 55:02.249
Excellent, Pidge.

55:03.626 --> 55:05.086
[all gasp]

55:05.169 --> 55:06.629
Dad?

55:09.298 --> 55:11.509
Don't be afraid.
We're here to help you escape.

55:12.134 --> 55:15.679
It's you... It's you, the Champion.

55:15.763 --> 55:19.225
If anyone can get us out of here, he can.

55:19.308 --> 55:21.977
Wh... What did you call me?
We don't have much time.

55:22.061 --> 55:25.793
- Let's get to the escape pods.
- Let's go. Come on!

55:27.024 --> 55:28.508
Whoa-ho-ho!
Yeah, buddy!

55:28.509 --> 55:30.736
<i>This is way more fun
without Hunk's barfing!</i>

55:32.029 --> 55:33.697
[grunts, groans]

55:33.781 --> 55:35.658
[groaning]

55:38.994 --> 55:40.121
Bingo.

55:41.205 --> 55:43.124
Let's get out of here.
Open up.

55:44.834 --> 55:48.003
<i>It's me. Keith. Your buddy.</i>

55:49.672 --> 55:53.175
It's me!
Keith, your...

55:53.259 --> 55:55.928
<i>I am your paladin!</i>

56:00.141 --> 56:01.892
I'm bonding with you!

56:01.976 --> 56:04.353
Hey! Come on!
We're connected!

56:09.191 --> 56:10.401
[grunts]

56:10.860 --> 56:12.528
You're not getting this lion!

56:16.866 --> 56:18.200
[groans]

56:27.877 --> 56:30.713
[grunting]

56:39.763 --> 56:41.891
[groaning]

56:41.974 --> 56:44.560
[breathing heavily]

56:46.437 --> 56:47.438
[gasps]

56:54.987 --> 56:57.323
Good kitty. Let's roll.

57:00.868 --> 57:01.911
Hurry!

57:02.536 --> 57:03.913
<i>[drone] Halt!
[gasps]</i>

57:11.795 --> 57:13.422
[groans]

57:13.506 --> 57:15.299
[sound becomes distorted]

57:15.382 --> 57:17.009
<i>[distorted]
Shiro, what's wrong?</i>

57:17.802 --> 57:19.678
[sound returns to normal]

57:28.979 --> 57:30.439
[drone thuds]

57:33.567 --> 57:35.486
<i>Thank you, Shiro.</i>

57:36.612 --> 57:38.697
Wait! How do you...?

57:38.781 --> 57:41.992
Shiro, that was amazing!
Where did you learn to fight with that?

57:42.993 --> 57:44.537
No idea.

57:50.876 --> 57:53.994
Come on, just break, you stupid thing!

57:56.924 --> 57:58.592
<i>Score one for Hunk!</i>

58:05.933 --> 58:06.934
You guys made it!

58:07.017 --> 58:10.813
- Kitty Rose has left the stage!
- Let's get the heck out of here!

58:10.896 --> 58:14.066
<i>[Hunk] I hope I stopped that cannon.
I could barely make a dent in it.</i>

58:14.149 --> 58:16.902
- They stole the Red Lion!
- After them!

58:16.986 --> 58:21.991
Either we get those lions or we blow
this whole planet to cosmic dust!

58:22.074 --> 58:23.617
Fire the ion cannon!

58:23.701 --> 58:26.579
Sir, the ion cannon has been damaged.

58:26.662 --> 58:29.726
Then, send the drones to fix it!

59:17.880 --> 59:19.548
[roars]

59:20.716 --> 59:23.218
[all roar]

59:23.302 --> 59:25.137
Oh...
[cheers]

59:25.220 --> 59:27.681
[alarm blaring]
Huh?

59:27.765 --> 59:29.224
<i>[Coran] Oh, quiznak!</i>

59:42.071 --> 59:46.033
Sendak is entering the Arusian atmosphere.
We need Voltron now!

59:51.956 --> 59:54.083
[roars]

01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:10.975
<i>[male voice] The ion
cannon is back online!</i>

01:00:11.058 --> 01:00:12.059
Fire!

01:00:24.238 --> 01:00:26.657
[all groaning]

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.662
Man, those Galra guys
repair things fast.

01:00:32.413 --> 01:00:34.415
The barrier gets weaker
with every blast.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:37.001
Once that shield goes down,
the castle will be defenseless.

01:00:37.084 --> 01:00:40.337
I can give you cover
with the castle defenses for a while,

01:00:40.421 --> 01:00:44.675
but you have to form Voltron now
or we'll all be destroyed!

01:00:44.758 --> 01:00:46.218
<i>[Hunk] Jeez, no pressure.</i>

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.142
[electricity crackling]

01:00:53.225 --> 01:00:54.518
[groaning]

01:00:54.601 --> 01:00:56.236
Listen up, Team Voltron!

01:00:56.237 --> 01:00:58.689
The only way to succeed is
to give it all you've got!

01:00:58.772 --> 01:01:02.151
<i>This looks bad, but we can do this!
Are you with me?</i>

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:07.364
- I'm nodding. Is everyone else nodding?
- Yes.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:11.201
<i>- [Shiro] Let's do this!
- [Lance] Uh, how?</i>

01:01:11.285 --> 01:01:14.621
<i>[Shiro] Good question. Does anyone have
any ideas of how to form Voltron?</i>

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:17.124
<i>[Hunk] I don't see a "combine
into giant robot" button</i>

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.084
<i>anywhere on my dashboard.</i>

01:01:26.633 --> 01:01:27.676
<i>[Pidge] This is insane!</i>

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.138
<i>Can't they just cease fire for one
minute so we can figure this out?</i>

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.973
<i>Is that too much to ask?</i>

01:01:40.147 --> 01:01:42.858
<i>- [Keith] We've got to do something.
- [Hunk] Combine!</i>

01:01:42.941 --> 01:01:45.611
<i>- [Keith groans] Hey!
- Okay, that didn't work.</i>

01:01:48.322 --> 01:01:51.116
<i>Quickly, Paladins!
Our energy levels are getting low!</i>

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.576
[groans]

01:01:52.659 --> 01:01:55.996
Maybe if we fly in formation,
we'll just combine.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.414
Take off on my cue.

01:01:58.373 --> 01:02:02.044
<i>One, two, three, Voltron!</i>

01:02:03.378 --> 01:02:06.548
<i>- [Keith] Here we go!
- [Lance] Come on, come on!</i>

01:02:07.132 --> 01:02:08.675
[grunting]

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:11.804
- Nothing's happening.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait! I feel something!

01:02:11.887 --> 01:02:12.940
I do, too. I feel it.

01:02:12.941 --> 01:02:16.100
It's like we're all being
pulled in the same direction!

01:02:16.183 --> 01:02:19.937
Uh, guys, I think I know why.
Look up.

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.188
<i>[Lance] What the cheese?</i>

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.941
<i>[Pidge] Sendak's ship
is sucking us in like a black hole!</i>

01:02:24.024 --> 01:02:28.403
Send a report to Emperor Zarkon:
"The day is ours."

01:02:34.993 --> 01:02:36.620
[both groan]

01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:38.831
Oh, no!

01:02:38.914 --> 01:02:42.084
<i>I don't care what you say, Shiro.
I'm panicking now!</i>

01:02:42.167 --> 01:02:43.335
[Hunk screaming]

01:02:43.418 --> 01:02:45.462
<i>- [Pidge] It can't end here!
- [Lance] This is it!</i>

01:02:45.546 --> 01:02:47.631
<i>[Keith] It's been an honor
flying with you boys.</i>

01:02:47.714 --> 01:02:48.841
<i>[Hunk] Oh, no!</i>

01:03:01.186 --> 01:03:04.940
No! We can do this.
We have to believe in ourselves.

01:03:06.066 --> 01:03:09.820
We can't give up.
We are the universe's only hope.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.355
<i>Everyone is relying on us.</i>

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:15.409
<i>We can't fail! We won't fail!</i>

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:19.037
If we work together, we'll win together!

01:03:20.372 --> 01:03:21.373
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.169
[all roar]

01:03:28.797 --> 01:03:30.215
[roars]

01:03:58.744 --> 01:03:59.745
[roars]

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.795
[both gasp]

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:24.436
[gasps]
Voltron!

01:04:25.229 --> 01:04:27.731
- I can't believe it!
- We formed Voltron!

01:04:27.814 --> 01:04:30.859
- I'm a leg!
- How are we doing this?

01:04:32.945 --> 01:04:35.239
I don't know, but let's get that cannon!

01:04:57.636 --> 01:04:59.596
[groans]

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.205
[all yelling]

01:05:44.266 --> 01:05:45.851
Good work, Paladins!

01:05:45.934 --> 01:05:46.935
[all sigh]

01:05:47.019 --> 01:05:49.229
- Thanks, pretty lady.
- We did it.

01:05:50.063 --> 01:05:52.774
- Heck yeah, we did.
- How did we do it?

01:05:52.858 --> 01:05:56.236
I was just, like, screaming
the whole time. Maybe that did it.

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:03.660
We're not going to stop searching
until we find your brother and father.

01:06:03.744 --> 01:06:06.747
<i>Wherever they are,
I know they'd be proud of you.</i>

01:06:08.373 --> 01:06:12.127
We won the battle,
but the war has only just begun.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:15.964
I'm afraid Zarkon will not stop
until he gets these lions.

01:06:16.048 --> 01:06:18.133
Good thing you paladins know
what you're doing,

01:06:18.216 --> 01:06:21.053
because you're going to have
to form Voltron again and again.

01:06:21.136 --> 01:06:22.846
Totally.
Wait, what?

01:06:22.929 --> 01:06:24.848
We barely survived
forming Voltron this one time.

01:06:24.931 --> 01:06:26.725
And you only had to fight one ship.

01:06:26.808 --> 01:06:29.269
Wait until you have to fight
a whole fleet of them!

01:06:29.353 --> 01:06:32.814
It's not going to be easy
being the Defenders of the Universe.

01:06:35.942 --> 01:06:37.798
Defenders of the Universe, huh?

01:06:37.799 --> 01:06:39.654
That's got a nice ring to it.
