WEBVTT

01:18.782 --> 01:21.896
- Mr. Davies?
- Please, call me John.

01:21.996 --> 01:23.633
Found the place all right, then?

01:23.733 --> 01:26.154
Yeah, I used to visit Saundersfoot
when I was a kid actually,

01:26.254 --> 01:28.747
- but just down the road. So...
- Oh, good.

01:28.847 --> 01:30.638
I know the area quite well, yeah.

01:30.738 --> 01:34.210
I thought I'd show you around the house
and make sure you're all settled in.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.540
Yeah, that's great. Cheers.

01:53.977 --> 01:57.661
- Looks even better than the picture.
- It's a wonderful house.

01:57.761 --> 02:00.610
Dates back to the 19th century.

02:00.710 --> 02:04.214
It's definitely one of the best houses
of that era still around.

02:04.314 --> 02:06.550
Looks superb.

02:07.287 --> 02:09.525
This is the kitchen.

02:09.625 --> 02:11.946
All pretty self-explanatory.

02:12.046 --> 02:14.500
There's a spacious oven over there,

02:14.600 --> 02:17.165
perfect for cooking a family dinner.

02:17.265 --> 02:19.868
Will any family members
be joining you while you're here?

02:19.968 --> 02:21.380
No, just me.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.460
Lot of space in this house
for just one person.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.694
Yeah, well... just working
on a new writing project, so...

02:29.294 --> 02:31.365
a bit of space is exactly
what I'm looking for.

02:31.465 --> 02:35.781
- Oh, really? You're writing a book?
- No, a film. I'm a screenwriter.

02:35.881 --> 02:39.413
Oh, really? Have you written
anything I might have seen?

02:39.513 --> 02:41.942
Depends. Do you like horror films?

02:42.042 --> 02:46.216
No, all that blood and violence
isn't my cup of tea.

02:46.316 --> 02:49.039
Well, I write horror films,

02:49.139 --> 02:51.975
and I guess they're not
for everyone, are they?

03:01.452 --> 03:05.378
This is the living room.
Wonderful fireplace.

03:05.478 --> 03:08.474
You can pick up some wood
for that in the nearby town.

03:08.574 --> 03:10.445
Or if you're the outdoor type,

03:10.545 --> 03:15.492
there's a woodland at the bottom
of the garden, and an ax in the shed.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.632
It's fine.

03:23.634 --> 03:27.701
You got two bathrooms on this floor,
and five bedrooms.

03:27.801 --> 03:30.848
So you can take your pick from those.

03:31.248 --> 03:33.345
Every bed has fresh linen.

03:33.445 --> 03:37.342
And there's an airing cupboard
downstairs full of spares.

03:38.354 --> 03:42.853
Now, I need to explain
something that's, well...

03:42.953 --> 03:45.514
a little unusual.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.829
What's that?

03:47.929 --> 03:51.160
Although the advert
says there are two floors...

03:51.260 --> 03:52.680
there's also a third floor.

03:52.780 --> 03:57.573
Well, it's not so much an entire floor,
more like an attic.

03:57.673 --> 04:00.144
That doesn't sound so unusual.

04:00.244 --> 04:02.365
Well, the unusual thing is,

04:02.465 --> 04:06.219
there's actually a tenant
living on the third floor.

04:09.662 --> 04:11.858
The listing didn't mention that
though, did it?

04:11.958 --> 04:15.894
I apologize, but it tends
to put a lot of people off.

04:16.648 --> 04:18.694
I can see why, Mrs. Connelly.

04:18.793 --> 04:21.098
I was kind of hoping to have
this place to myself, you know?

04:21.197 --> 04:25.005
It will seem like you have.
The tenant's an old blind woman.

04:25.105 --> 04:28.211
Her name is Agnes.
You won't even know she's here.

04:28.311 --> 04:32.445
- She hasn't left the room in years.
- I got to be honest, Mrs. Connelly,

04:32.545 --> 04:35.374
I really think you should've mentioned
this in the advert, you know.

04:35.474 --> 04:38.021
I mean... No, no, hear me out.

04:38.121 --> 04:41.444
When I rent a place, Mrs. Connelly,
I don't expect to be sharing it

04:41.544 --> 04:44.472
- with a complete stranger, now, do I?
- Well, I'm sorry.

04:44.572 --> 04:48.699
But I can assure you,
Agnes won't be of any inconvenience.

04:48.799 --> 04:51.320
She hardly makes a sound.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.335
I mean, you've seen
the size of this place.

04:54.435 --> 04:58.798
You'll have two very large floors
all to yourself.

04:59.694 --> 05:03.759
Well, shouldn't we at least go up
so I can maybe introduce myself?

05:03.859 --> 05:07.592
Oh, I doubt she'd answer the door.
She likes to keep to herself.

05:09.079 --> 05:12.183
Oh, she's fine.
You can see her from outside.

05:12.283 --> 05:16.024
She just sits in her rocking chair,
looking out of the attic window.

05:16.124 --> 05:17.802
I thought you said she was blind.

05:17.902 --> 05:21.667
Well, she is, but she hasn't
been blind her entire life.

05:21.767 --> 05:25.140
She used to sit by the window
when she could see.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.234
I suppose old habits die hard.

05:29.314 --> 05:32.226
Yeah, I suppose they do, Mrs. Connelly.

05:33.714 --> 05:36.851
- Shall we go downstairs?
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

05:43.063 --> 05:45.800
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.033
Okay.

05:53.133 --> 05:57.208
Here's the keys to the front door,
the back door,

05:57.308 --> 05:59.511
as well as the shed in the back garden.

05:59.611 --> 06:01.707
- You have my number, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:01.807 --> 06:04.738
Feel free to give me a call
if there's anything else you need.

06:04.838 --> 06:07.751
- Yeah, I'm sure I'll be fine.
- Okay, when you leave,

06:07.851 --> 06:11.649
just slip the keys under that plant pot,
and I'll slip by and pick them up.

06:11.749 --> 06:14.528
- Yeah, will do.
- Okay.

07:52.475 --> 07:54.293
So...

07:55.180 --> 07:58.301
There is three of us here, Mrs. Connelly.

11:37.543 --> 11:39.747
- Hello.
- Shit!

11:40.759 --> 11:43.412
Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.

11:43.512 --> 11:47.529
It's fine. I didn't realize
anyone had moved in.

11:47.629 --> 11:50.861
Oh, no, it's not permanent. It's a...

11:50.961 --> 11:54.957
- It's just a holiday place.
- Oh, nice.

11:55.368 --> 11:57.203
You...

11:57.539 --> 12:00.636
- You making a pie?
- Sorry?

12:00.736 --> 12:03.039
The blackberries.

12:03.199 --> 12:06.052
Oh, yeah.

12:06.681 --> 12:10.329
- You don't mind me picking them, do you?
- Oh, no. No, not at all.

12:10.429 --> 12:12.282
You're a local?

12:12.382 --> 12:15.394
Yeah, down the road.

12:15.596 --> 12:18.853
I'm Cassie. Cassie Konrad.

12:18.953 --> 12:21.581
John... Davies.

12:22.925 --> 12:24.880
It's nice to meet you.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.224
Nice to meet you, too.

12:28.077 --> 12:29.748
If you...

12:29.848 --> 12:32.977
If you ever wanna borrow
a bowl of sugar, just...

12:33.304 --> 12:35.133
just knock the door, will you?

12:36.133 --> 12:39.873
Maybe I will. Thanks.

16:14.398 --> 16:16.234
Hello?

17:58.233 --> 18:01.092
- Hi.
- Got any sugar?

18:03.113 --> 18:04.959
Yeah.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.478
Come in.

18:13.057 --> 18:15.567
Yes, it's quite a place.

18:17.014 --> 18:20.012
Yeah, I was looking
at the ident earlier on.

18:20.112 --> 18:21.559
Just before you came, actually.

18:21.659 --> 18:25.319
It's got to be around
600 years old or something.

18:26.365 --> 18:30.230
- How long are you here for?
- I booked it for eight weeks.

18:30.330 --> 18:33.837
Hey, do you know the old woman
who lives upstairs?

18:33.937 --> 18:38.353
- There's an old lady upstairs?
- Yeah, on the third floor.

18:38.453 --> 18:40.717
That's weird.

18:40.817 --> 18:44.182
What, you never heard that
an old woman lived here?

18:44.282 --> 18:47.269
No. I thought it was
just a holiday home now.

18:47.369 --> 18:49.366
Yeah, me, too.

18:49.466 --> 18:53.339
But apparently the third floor
has a permanent resident.

18:53.439 --> 18:56.729
- You talk to her?
- Nope. The door's locked.

18:56.829 --> 19:01.061
She never comes out.
And no one comes to see her, either.

19:01.161 --> 19:04.776
- That's quite sad.
- Yeah. A bit creepy to be honest.

19:04.876 --> 19:09.260
- You scaredy cat.
- Yeah, I guess I should grow a pair.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.376
I suppose this big house can get
a bit creepy if you're alone all the time.

19:13.476 --> 19:17.091
How come you didn't come
with a friend or a girlfriend?

19:17.191 --> 19:19.204
Well, I don't have a girlfriend.

19:19.304 --> 19:24.143
And I suppose this self-imposed isolation
sort of comes with the territory.

19:24.243 --> 19:26.540
What territory?

19:26.640 --> 19:29.697
- I'm a writer.
- Oh, yeah?

19:29.797 --> 19:32.160
Yeah. Well, I say I'm a writer,

19:32.260 --> 19:35.682
but I'm struggling to string
a sentence together at the minute.

19:37.287 --> 19:40.131
Got a bit of writer's block going on?

19:40.867 --> 19:43.648
You know, I feel like
I've really hit a wall, you know.

19:43.748 --> 19:47.155
That's why I booked this place. I thought
the peace and quiet may help, but...

19:47.255 --> 19:49.859
it hasn't worked so far though.

19:49.959 --> 19:53.657
Well, you've only been here five minutes.
Give it a chance.

19:53.757 --> 19:57.904
True. Patience isn't
my strong point though.

20:01.671 --> 20:03.919
So, you...

20:04.219 --> 20:06.340
You're probably wanting that sugar, right?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.326
Sorry?

20:08.426 --> 20:11.030
The sugar you came over to borrow.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.068
Right, yeah.

20:24.456 --> 20:27.976
Well, I suppose I'll see you around?

20:29.171 --> 20:33.330
- How about tonight?
- You want a tour of the pubs?

20:33.430 --> 20:36.786
Pubs really aren't my scene,
to be honest with you. I'm...

20:37.686 --> 20:40.135
I'm pretty boring.

20:40.235 --> 20:43.106
It's not really my scene either,
to be honest.

20:43.206 --> 20:45.873
I suppose I'm boring, too.

20:46.997 --> 20:49.794
Why don't you just come around here?

20:49.894 --> 20:52.565
We can be boring together.

20:52.665 --> 20:54.585
Perhaps I can cook.

20:54.685 --> 20:58.424
- You cook, do you?
- No.

20:58.893 --> 21:02.808
But I'm not too bad at ordering
a take away or something maybe?

21:02.908 --> 21:05.829
Yeah, that'd be nice.

21:05.929 --> 21:09.821
Great. How about 8:00?

21:09.921 --> 21:14.078
- Yeah, okay, I'll see you then.
- See you then.

21:26.036 --> 21:29.397
Just thinking about childhood stuff.

21:29.892 --> 21:33.271
It really is a playground for the wicked?

21:34.535 --> 21:38.148
So... tell me a bit about yourself.

21:38.248 --> 21:40.307
Like what?

21:40.407 --> 21:42.529
I don't know.

21:45.110 --> 21:47.398
What kind of music you like?

21:47.498 --> 21:50.771
- What a shocking effort?
- All right, all right.

21:50.871 --> 21:53.682
Bit rusty, bit rusty.

21:55.295 --> 22:00.562
- Tell me a bit about your childhood, then.
- You sound like a psychiatrist now.

22:01.966 --> 22:04.913
Well, I was raised Catholic.

22:05.013 --> 22:09.548
- Rebel by any chance?
- No, I was a good girl.

22:09.648 --> 22:13.397
- That almost sounded convincing.
- Seriously, I really was.

22:13.497 --> 22:18.572
- Yeah, scared of purgatory, were you?
- No, scared of my parents.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.185
I'd rather face purgatory,
than deal with those two.

22:21.285 --> 22:23.347
Quite strict then.

22:23.447 --> 22:25.283
Yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.319
So what about you?

22:33.148 --> 22:35.176
What about me?

22:35.276 --> 22:39.585
- Were your parents strict?
- No, not at all.

22:39.685 --> 22:42.408
They just... sort of nudged me
in the right direction.

22:42.508 --> 22:44.785
Gave me space to find
my own way, you know.

22:44.885 --> 22:48.376
- That's really cool.
- Yeah, they were.

22:48.476 --> 22:53.494
It's mad. My parents were together for
like forty years before they passed on.

22:53.594 --> 22:56.818
Did everything together, those two.
Proper joined at the hip, they were.

22:56.918 --> 23:00.006
Yeah, they even died
within a week of each other.

23:00.106 --> 23:03.128
- Does that scare you?
- What? Dying?

23:03.228 --> 23:04.881
No.

23:04.981 --> 23:08.154
The prospect of ending up
with someone for that long.

23:08.254 --> 23:09.924
No.

23:10.024 --> 23:12.136
No, I don't think it does.

23:12.236 --> 23:14.942
I mean, my parents were
together for decades.

23:15.042 --> 23:18.875
They went through a lot of shit together
and came out on the other side, still in love.

23:18.975 --> 23:23.329
I suppose I'd like to find a relationship
with that kind of commitment, you know.

23:24.650 --> 23:26.519
Cool.

23:27.456 --> 23:32.081
But I haven't always had the best luck
with women to be honest with you.

23:32.940 --> 23:37.776
I can remember when me
and my last girlfriend broke up.

23:37.876 --> 23:42.374
One of the last things said was,
"It's no one's fault."

23:42.474 --> 23:47.039
But the truth is, that's one of those
great lies people tell themselves.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.323
Someone's always at fault.

23:50.423 --> 23:54.942
I guess for the best part
of that one, it was mine.

23:55.423 --> 23:57.659
But you learn.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.307
I know the mistakes I made. And...

24:02.035 --> 24:05.891
I don't want to make the same mistakes
again, you know what I mean?

24:06.419 --> 24:09.756
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

24:11.930 --> 24:14.684
So, what do you look for in a woman?

24:14.784 --> 24:16.855
Good question.

24:19.218 --> 24:21.484
I don't know.

24:22.456 --> 24:24.791
Maybe someone...

24:25.270 --> 24:28.697
Someone who I can be talking to...

24:28.797 --> 24:31.590
in a packed restaurant or bar,

24:31.690 --> 24:35.388
and look up and realize
that we've been talking for hours,

24:35.488 --> 24:38.570
place is all cleared out.

24:39.026 --> 24:41.216
And we didn't even realize,
because when we're together

24:41.316 --> 24:44.402
it feels like we're the only
two people in the world.

24:46.700 --> 24:49.455
God, that sounds cheesy.

24:49.555 --> 24:51.758
No, it doesn't at all.

24:52.946 --> 24:55.342
I always say it's...

24:55.442 --> 25:00.840
It's not about material possessions
or who looks good on your arm at a party.

25:01.928 --> 25:04.489
It's about what's in here.

25:10.502 --> 25:13.121
Yes, it's so true.

25:15.988 --> 25:18.423
So very true.

25:25.295 --> 25:29.352
- So, do you wanna stay tonight?
- Not tonight.

25:32.159 --> 25:34.838
You got to be somewhere, right?

25:34.938 --> 25:36.830
No.

25:38.805 --> 25:41.849
I just don't wanna spoil the night
by rushing into anything.

25:43.687 --> 25:45.764
I understand.

26:06.412 --> 26:08.289
I'll...

26:09.016 --> 26:11.235
I'll see you soon.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.009
I'll see you soon.

26:14.109 --> 26:15.944
Night.

30:31.645 --> 30:33.481
Hi.

30:34.786 --> 30:37.440
Come in, do you want a cup of coffee?

30:37.540 --> 30:40.510
I don't know, I just...

30:41.173 --> 30:44.642
- I feel really embarrassed.
- Why?

30:45.028 --> 30:47.531
What happened between us.

30:47.884 --> 30:50.047
I don't normally kiss a guy
I've just met like that.

30:50.147 --> 30:52.880
- I don't know what you must think of me.
- What do you mean?

30:52.980 --> 30:57.260
- You must think I'm a slut or something.
- I don't think that at all.

30:57.560 --> 31:01.400
I thought we had a great night
last night, just talking.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.987
It's a rare thing these days.

31:09.607 --> 31:13.474
I hope you really mean that.
I don't want you to think I'm some bimbo.

31:13.574 --> 31:17.079
I felt we had a connection
and I went with it.

31:17.179 --> 31:20.209
But I also don't want you to think
I'm some frigid little virgin either.

31:20.309 --> 31:23.240
Now I think I've given you
the wrong impression both ways.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.898
- What's so funny?
- You. It's just...

31:26.998 --> 31:29.251
There's just no lying in you, is there?

31:29.351 --> 31:34.734
You just lay your troubles out there
in the most sweetest, most truthful way.

31:35.029 --> 31:37.712
That's what I liked
about you the other night.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.971
Well, that's what I like
about you right now, in fact.

31:40.071 --> 31:43.485
My insane vulnerability doesn't
make you want to run a mile then?

31:43.585 --> 31:47.434
Nope. Do you know
I've started writing again?

31:47.534 --> 31:49.949
- That's great.
- Yeah.

31:50.149 --> 31:53.788
- I don't think it's a coincidence either.
- What do you mean?

31:53.888 --> 31:56.000
You've awoken something in me, Cas.

31:56.100 --> 31:59.449
You know, something that I thought
I had lost a long, long time ago.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.844
So, what? Do you wanna come in?

32:04.256 --> 32:07.713
I can't right now.
But what are you doing tomorrow?

32:07.813 --> 32:09.641
I'll be here.

32:09.741 --> 32:12.897
You can come around anytime.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.210
Yeah, okay.

32:15.310 --> 32:18.431
- So I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

32:19.993 --> 32:22.899
- Hey, Cas.
- Yeah?

32:22.999 --> 32:24.834
The...

32:25.338 --> 32:28.607
The other night, do you know I was...

32:28.969 --> 32:32.865
I was worried it was just
a one-time thing, you know.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.991
Not for me, it wasn't.

32:36.407 --> 32:38.443
Me neither.

32:39.404 --> 32:41.623
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:45.442 --> 34:47.204
Agnes?

34:47.304 --> 34:48.875
Hello?

34:48.975 --> 34:51.842
It's John Davies here.
Look, I'm staying downstairs.

34:51.943 --> 34:54.447
Me and you really need to talk, yeah?

34:55.902 --> 34:57.780
Agnes?

35:07.391 --> 35:09.210
Agnes?

36:32.321 --> 36:34.839
What happened to you, dolly?

36:51.413 --> 36:53.832
You poor baby.

38:17.113 --> 38:21.956
Do you know I think the woman upstairs
has come out of her room?

38:23.056 --> 38:24.635
What makes you think that?

38:24.735 --> 38:28.943
The record player's on every night.

38:29.325 --> 38:33.342
Also, there's lots of stuff being moved
around the house, you know.

38:33.442 --> 38:38.307
- Creeping you out, is it?
- Yeah. A little bit.

38:39.127 --> 38:41.688
Maybe you should call the owner.

38:42.308 --> 38:46.530
Yeah, I've been having some
pretty vivid dreams as well.

38:48.945 --> 38:51.179
Like what?

38:52.335 --> 38:57.112
Well, there was... there was one
where I was drowning.

38:57.711 --> 39:01.740
And another freaky number
where I'm having my teeth knocked out.

39:02.478 --> 39:05.622
Sounds like typical anxiety dreams.

39:10.335 --> 39:12.869
What are you anxious about?

39:13.294 --> 39:16.328
Is it just the woman upstairs or...

39:16.604 --> 39:21.413
Well, I suppose that's...
strange enough, isn't it? But now...

39:21.513 --> 39:25.153
Yeah, I was pretty anxious anyway.
That's why I came here.

39:25.253 --> 39:27.572
London was getting me right down.

39:28.400 --> 39:33.289
Too many people, too much
hustle and bustle, you know.

39:34.027 --> 39:36.704
How come you chose this area?

39:37.742 --> 39:40.871
I used to come down this way
all the time when I was a kid.

39:41.784 --> 39:45.607
It's one of the great memories
I have with my parents, actually.

39:45.707 --> 39:49.757
I can remember they used to
pick me up every Friday after school

39:49.857 --> 39:53.179
and we'd just drive on down
to Saundersfoot, it was great.

39:53.279 --> 39:55.399
It's lovely down there.

39:55.499 --> 39:57.334
Yeah.

39:57.646 --> 40:00.634
I can remember we used to have food
in that restaurant on the front.

40:00.734 --> 40:02.753
You know, overlooking the beach.

40:03.005 --> 40:06.276
Then I'd go play in those arcades.

40:06.662 --> 40:09.381
Fantastic memories, they were.

40:09.576 --> 40:12.598
- Sounds wonderful.
- Yeah.

40:12.698 --> 40:15.300
Yeah, it really was.

40:17.867 --> 40:21.705
You know, I went to London
for the work originally.

40:21.805 --> 40:27.328
But truth be told, Cas, I'm really not
looking forward to going back there.

40:27.910 --> 40:31.066
Well, at least you had your shot
at the Big Smoke.

40:31.166 --> 40:34.629
I always thought about moving
to Cardiff or London,

40:34.729 --> 40:38.871
- but I never did.
- What stopped you?

40:38.971 --> 40:41.559
I'm your typical small town girl.

40:41.659 --> 40:44.749
I dreamed of the bright lights
and the big city, but...

40:44.849 --> 40:47.512
I could never make it happen.

40:47.812 --> 40:49.808
I'm not bitter though.

40:49.908 --> 40:54.375
Sometimes I think the way you're meant
to be, you're meant to be.

40:54.475 --> 40:57.831
Well, you can be whatever
you want to be, Cas.

40:57.931 --> 41:02.506
You don't have to go anywhere to achieve it.
You can make things happen right here.

41:02.606 --> 41:06.126
You don't necessarily have
to work for anybody either.

41:06.889 --> 41:11.051
You can just do it yourself. You just...

41:11.154 --> 41:12.983
Yeah, you gotta believe, yeah.

41:13.083 --> 41:16.916
You know, I make some
of my own jewelry, I thought...

41:17.016 --> 41:19.962
I guess I hoped that I could
turn that into a business one day.

41:20.062 --> 41:24.303
- Well, you should do that.
- It's not as easy as that though, is it?

41:24.403 --> 41:28.060
I've got a creative mind,
but not much of a business one.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.926
Then perhaps I could help you.
Well, I've produced some of my own films.

41:32.026 --> 41:35.558
Maybe I could help you get into
the business mindset of things, yeah?

41:35.658 --> 41:38.044
And why would you want to do that?

41:38.144 --> 41:41.015
'Cause, Miss Konrad...

41:41.418 --> 41:44.003
you have inspired me.

41:44.782 --> 41:48.120
And I'd love to return the favor.
It'd be great.

41:49.959 --> 41:52.605
- So the writing's going well then?
- Yeah.

41:52.705 --> 41:55.502
Yeah, yeah, it really is.

41:55.602 --> 41:59.059
I came here to write a script
that means something to me, you know.

41:59.159 --> 42:01.388
Something personal.

42:02.188 --> 42:07.052
And I'm... I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

42:08.124 --> 42:13.603
I suppose... it's like the more I let go,
the freer my mind becomes, you know.

42:16.523 --> 42:18.253
Then think of it this way.

42:18.353 --> 42:21.659
It might be creepy living
with a strange woman upstairs, but...

42:21.759 --> 42:24.748
it'll make great material
for the horror films.

42:25.248 --> 42:27.086
True.

42:27.186 --> 42:30.272
Hey, I should open a shop
and you should be the writer, yeah?

42:30.372 --> 42:33.978
- What would I write about?
- I don't know.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.927
Hello, Agnes?

45:47.424 --> 45:49.226
Hello?

45:58.537 --> 46:00.397
Hello?

46:42.066 --> 46:44.668
Well, it sounds crazy, right?

46:45.673 --> 46:48.684
If you say it happened,
then I believe you.

46:49.938 --> 46:51.998
You do?

46:52.753 --> 46:56.317
There's a lot of things in this world
we don't understand.

46:56.853 --> 47:00.197
I try to keep an open mind
about everything.

47:01.176 --> 47:03.610
So, what are you gonna do?

47:04.700 --> 47:08.532
Well, I'd like to speak to the landlady,
that's for certain.

47:08.632 --> 47:11.884
Maybe she can shed
some light on all of this?

47:12.113 --> 47:15.628
But come on, is she really gonna admit
there's something strange going on?

47:15.728 --> 47:18.188
Even if she did know.

47:18.288 --> 47:21.072
I don't think she wants
that sort of things getting out.

47:21.172 --> 47:23.810
No one will ever rent the place again.

47:23.910 --> 47:25.712
True.

47:26.923 --> 47:31.529
Well, I'd like to speak to Mrs. Bloody
Mystery upstairs, that's for sure.

47:32.229 --> 47:35.164
You know, if you think there's
something paranormal going on,

47:35.264 --> 47:37.827
you could get a priest in
to bless the place.

47:37.927 --> 47:41.558
- There's the Catholic in you talking.
- Lapsed Catholic.

47:41.658 --> 47:44.689
Yeah. Well, I'm more interested
in finding answers, Cas,

47:44.789 --> 47:47.811
not bloody purging the place.

47:47.911 --> 47:50.413
How about a Ouija board?

47:51.017 --> 47:53.419
A Ouija board?

47:55.442 --> 47:58.562
That would definitely be a last resort.

48:00.743 --> 48:03.746
Do you want me
to stay here with you tonight?

48:06.276 --> 48:08.374
As good as that sounds...

48:08.474 --> 48:12.824
No, I'm probably better off
just utilizing these creative juices

48:12.924 --> 48:15.653
while they're still flowing, you know.

48:15.753 --> 48:20.635
I don't know. Perhaps I'm just...
losing my mind here or something.

48:21.139 --> 48:23.541
You're not crazy.

48:25.712 --> 48:28.110
Part of me wonders. I don't know.

48:28.210 --> 48:31.075
Am I letting my imagination
run away with me here?

48:31.425 --> 48:35.864
Plus, I'm just getting the lines between
fact and fiction a bit blurred, you know?

48:37.519 --> 48:40.422
You don't need to question yourself, John.

48:40.766 --> 48:43.464
Always trust your instinct.

48:43.564 --> 48:45.956
Trust your heart.

48:49.492 --> 48:53.102
You're a calming influence on me,
Cas, you know that?

48:53.202 --> 48:55.398
I try.

49:04.868 --> 49:06.764
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi.

49:06.864 --> 49:09.986
Mrs. Connelly, yeah.
It's John Davies here at the house.

49:10.086 --> 49:12.124
<i>Oh, hi. How's it going there?</i>

49:12.224 --> 49:16.548
Yeah, look, I just wanted to
ask you a couple of questions.

49:16.648 --> 49:20.222
- They might seem a little strange.
- <i>Okay. I'm intrigued.</i>

49:20.322 --> 49:22.159
Well, it's just about this house.

49:22.259 --> 49:26.925
I was wondering if you
ever had any previous residents mention

49:27.025 --> 49:29.470
unusual occurrences?

49:32.060 --> 49:36.894
- <i>Like what?</i>
- Occurrences of the supernatural.

49:38.594 --> 49:41.928
<i>No. Are you looking for material
for a film, Mr. Davies?</i>

49:42.028 --> 49:45.101
No. It's nothing like that. It's just
that there's been some unusual things

49:45.201 --> 49:49.642
happening in the house, that I'm really
struggling to find a rational explanation for.

49:49.742 --> 49:52.738
<i>Can you be more specific?</i>

49:52.838 --> 49:57.874
Well... Well, the record player
often comes on in the night by itself.

49:57.974 --> 50:00.545
And there's stuff being moved
around the house.

50:00.645 --> 50:03.359
And I was in the shower earlier on and...

50:03.459 --> 50:08.076
Writing appeared on the mirror just before
the door slammed and locked me in.

50:08.176 --> 50:13.352
<i>Well, that's quite a story.
You writers have wonderful imaginations.</i>

50:13.452 --> 50:16.675
Oh, no, no, no. It's just that I'm trying
to find out what's happening.

50:16.775 --> 50:21.993
I thought perhaps, I don't know, it could
be linked to the history of the place.

50:22.093 --> 50:27.277
Have you ever heard of an incidents
happening down the years or anything?

50:27.377 --> 50:31.493
<i>Of course I haven't.
Nothing that I know of.</i>

50:31.593 --> 50:35.334
So... I hope that this
woman upstairs, Agnes,

50:35.434 --> 50:37.755
is there anything at all
you can tell me about her?

50:37.855 --> 50:42.054
<i>I'm sorry, but I can't
divulge personal information.</i>

50:42.154 --> 50:45.936
<i>I'm sure you can appreciate that. I don't
think you'd like it if I blabbed your...</i>

50:46.036 --> 50:48.831
Yeah, of course.

50:49.150 --> 50:52.875
- Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you.
- <i>Anything else I can help you with, Mr. Davies?</i>

50:52.975 --> 50:55.571
- Have you...
- <i>If there is you know where to find me.</i>

50:55.671 --> 50:57.500
Yeah, that's fine...

50:58.350 --> 51:00.211
Hello?

51:05.880 --> 51:08.324
That went down great.

51:28.087 --> 51:31.008
Hello, Mr. Ouija board.

51:59.879 --> 52:01.892
All right.

52:02.292 --> 52:04.336
Fuck it.

52:21.609 --> 52:23.528
Spirit guides,

52:23.628 --> 52:26.559
guardian angels of light...

52:27.004 --> 52:30.358
I call upon you to answer my question.

52:38.375 --> 52:41.404
This is so fucking stupid.

53:00.522 --> 53:03.930
Fucking hell. Fucking hell.

53:04.030 --> 53:06.090
It works.

53:23.925 --> 53:26.869
The painting beneath the stairs...

53:27.957 --> 53:31.026
is there any significance to it?

54:24.359 --> 54:26.203
Death.

54:29.351 --> 54:31.612
Who died here?

54:33.334 --> 54:35.537
Who died?

54:41.231 --> 54:43.768
Was it an accident?

54:53.854 --> 54:55.156
No.

55:00.041 --> 55:02.338
The record player.

55:02.438 --> 55:05.465
Who keeps on turning on the record player?

55:14.200 --> 55:18.456
Did anybody use to listen to the player?
Anybody who lived here?

55:28.092 --> 55:29.953
Please...

55:32.634 --> 55:35.412
Who used to listen to the record player?

56:06.145 --> 56:07.947
Agnes.

56:18.902 --> 56:22.873
Did Agnes used to turn it on?

56:30.272 --> 56:32.051
No.

56:32.151 --> 56:34.753
Who turns it on?

56:38.939 --> 56:42.802
Come on, please. Tell me, who turns it on?

56:44.023 --> 56:46.083
All right.

56:48.438 --> 56:50.499
This doll...

56:52.421 --> 56:55.574
Did it belong to a child who died here?

57:04.318 --> 57:07.104
Who did the doll belong to?

57:41.887 --> 57:43.689
Murderer.

57:46.678 --> 57:48.522
Agnes.

57:54.124 --> 57:56.686
Is Agnes the murderer?

58:16.974 --> 58:18.977
Stop it.

58:19.739 --> 58:23.003
Stop it! Stop it, all right!

58:23.376 --> 58:26.077
Stop it! Stop it!

58:26.177 --> 58:30.054
Stop it. I've had enough
of this shit! Please.

59:11.040 --> 59:12.842
Agnes?

59:14.690 --> 59:17.503
Agnes, are you listening to me?

59:20.399 --> 59:23.219
You've had all you want of this.

59:46.154 --> 59:50.025
I knew you would come for me eventually.

59:50.529 --> 59:53.318
You're not the only one.

59:53.818 --> 59:55.280
What?

59:55.580 --> 59:58.157
The fallen angels.

59:59.997 --> 01:00:04.510
They want to take me to hell
for what I've done.

01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:07.669
What have you done, Agnes?

01:00:07.769 --> 01:00:10.146
I've sinned.

01:00:12.077 --> 01:00:16.260
- We've all sinned.
- Not like me.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.757
I've sinned in the worst possible way.

01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:25.302
Murder?

01:00:25.602 --> 01:00:27.962
As good as.

01:00:36.705 --> 01:00:39.724
Tell me. Please.

01:00:53.736 --> 01:00:57.757
You have a kind face.

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:08.662
Twenty years ago...

01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:13.072
I lived here with my husband, William,

01:01:13.172 --> 01:01:16.400
and our daughter, Catherine.

01:01:17.546 --> 01:01:20.616
We were such a happy family.

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.393
Then one day...

01:01:24.493 --> 01:01:27.031
William got sick.

01:01:27.131 --> 01:01:29.416
Very sick.

01:01:30.596 --> 01:01:34.057
I nursed him for many months.

01:01:35.638 --> 01:01:38.209
I stayed strong for him.

01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:43.845
But inside, I was terrified
of being left a widow.

01:01:43.945 --> 01:01:46.466
I prayed to God to heal my husband.

01:01:46.566 --> 01:01:49.285
But God didn't listen.

01:01:53.319 --> 01:01:55.873
After William died,

01:01:56.559 --> 01:01:59.896
this place was never the same.

01:02:01.143 --> 01:02:04.905
Catherine was devastated.

01:02:05.735 --> 01:02:10.677
Initially, she just stayed
in her room all day,

01:02:10.777 --> 01:02:13.855
playing with her china doll.

01:02:15.769 --> 01:02:19.090
She became a troubled child,

01:02:19.418 --> 01:02:22.149
and had problems at school.

01:02:22.249 --> 01:02:25.985
She even began to lash out at me.

01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:32.842
Sometimes when a person one loves dies,

01:02:32.942 --> 01:02:36.221
it brings people closer together.

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:43.993
For us, it just drove us apart.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:52.069
When Catherine was in her early 20's,

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:56.783
she used to hang around
with a girl from down the road.

01:02:57.311 --> 01:03:00.159
She was such a lovely girl.

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:03.028
Always smiling.

01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:10.018
And Catherine and she
got into an argument...

01:03:10.118 --> 01:03:12.884
about a boy.

01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:17.649
I was sitting in the living room

01:03:17.749 --> 01:03:21.320
listening to my favorite song.

01:03:22.892 --> 01:03:27.985
As I sat there,
I heard raised voices upstairs.

01:03:28.085 --> 01:03:31.108
They were louder than the music.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:35.057
As I raced out of the room
to see what was happening,

01:03:35.157 --> 01:03:39.738
I saw Catherine push
that young girl down the stairs.

01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:45.232
She broke her neck and died.

01:03:45.332 --> 01:03:47.393
Instantly.

01:03:52.145 --> 01:03:56.178
- It wasn't an accident, was it?
- No.

01:03:56.278 --> 01:03:59.009
I saw Catherine's face.

01:03:59.109 --> 01:04:01.638
It wasn't the face of my daughter,

01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:05.412
it was the face of pure evil.

01:04:05.512 --> 01:04:09.451
Catherine wanted to kill that young girl.

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:12.508
Did you call the police?

01:04:12.608 --> 01:04:14.929
My daughter was so young.

01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:18.692
She had her whole life ahead of her.

01:04:20.363 --> 01:04:23.755
I had to consider things.

01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:28.776
I decided not to involve the police.

01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:33.646
Why the hell not?

01:04:33.746 --> 01:04:37.111
I couldn't see the point
in two young girls

01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:40.292
losing their life on the same night.

01:04:40.392 --> 01:04:45.009
If I'd... If I'd reported
an accident to the police,

01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:47.763
they would have been bound
to find out the truth.

01:04:47.863 --> 01:04:50.907
I couldn't take that chance.

01:04:52.481 --> 01:04:56.927
I felt my daughter
was a good person at heart.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:01.403
She'd made a mistake.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.892
And let the evil in.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:09.904
Satan is a sly entity,

01:05:10.004 --> 01:05:13.360
and can influence any of us

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.596
in a moment of weakness.

01:05:17.493 --> 01:05:19.772
Tell me, what happened next?

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:25.480
I put the body
in a cupboard in the basement.

01:05:26.752 --> 01:05:32.028
I sealed the room,
wallpapered over the door.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:36.158
No one would even know
there's a room there.

01:05:37.196 --> 01:05:38.783
But the dead girl,

01:05:38.883 --> 01:05:42.263
she must have had some family
who were looking for her, no?

01:05:42.363 --> 01:05:47.472
She was an only child
who had run away from home.

01:05:47.572 --> 01:05:51.602
She hadn't talked to her parents in ages.

01:05:52.591 --> 01:05:55.927
And by the time she met Catherine...

01:05:57.232 --> 01:06:00.042
they were both dead.

01:06:00.504 --> 01:06:04.434
No one was going to come looking for her.

01:06:08.176 --> 01:06:11.775
This girl who died...
she haunts this place, doesn't she?

01:06:11.875 --> 01:06:14.564
She's not the only one.

01:06:14.664 --> 01:06:19.757
The fallen angels are looking for me.

01:06:19.857 --> 01:06:22.813
They're always looking.

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:26.494
Who the hell are the fallen angels, Agnes?

01:06:26.594 --> 01:06:29.232
Well, in the Bible,

01:06:29.332 --> 01:06:34.266
the angels of God and the angels of Satan.

01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:38.056
Satan and his fallen angels

01:06:38.156 --> 01:06:41.629
were thrown out of heaven

01:06:41.729 --> 01:06:44.911
and they have free reign on Earth

01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:48.926
to take the sinners to hell.

01:06:49.026 --> 01:06:51.205
After the murder,

01:06:51.305 --> 01:06:54.425
they took my sight away.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:58.558
Now they lie in wait.

01:07:00.456 --> 01:07:04.964
Waiting for my secret to come out.

01:07:05.064 --> 01:07:07.611
That's why I'm locked in here.

01:07:07.711 --> 01:07:13.646
I pray to God every day to protect me.

01:07:13.746 --> 01:07:16.710
But God won't even...

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:20.592
save his angels that have sinned.

01:07:20.692 --> 01:07:24.873
So what hope is there for me?

01:07:26.545 --> 01:07:29.572
Where's your daughter now, Agnes?

01:07:29.893 --> 01:07:33.541
I've unburdened myself,
but I'm still her mother.

01:07:33.641 --> 01:07:37.087
I'm still going to protect her.

01:07:38.015 --> 01:07:40.717
This girl who died...

01:07:41.313 --> 01:07:43.634
what was her name, Agnes?

01:07:43.734 --> 01:07:46.532
Her name was...

01:07:46.632 --> 01:07:48.503
Cassie.

01:07:49.603 --> 01:07:53.516
Cassie Konrad.

01:07:57.025 --> 01:08:00.098
- There must be some mistake.
- No mistake.

01:08:00.198 --> 01:08:02.927
I saw her die.

01:08:03.027 --> 01:08:06.130
With my own eyes.

01:08:07.561 --> 01:08:09.763
Oh, God!

01:08:11.376 --> 01:08:13.939
There's no God here anymore.

01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:16.904
This house is just full of evil.

01:08:17.004 --> 01:08:21.078
You should leave! Leave now!

01:08:24.675 --> 01:08:27.216
What about you, Agnes?

01:08:27.865 --> 01:08:30.495
I must accept...

01:08:31.095 --> 01:08:34.064
my fate.

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:05.590
Have the fallen angels come for me?

01:09:06.618 --> 01:09:08.821
I'm ready.

01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:12.810
It's me, Mother.

01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:16.484
- Catherine?
- Yes.

01:09:17.796 --> 01:09:20.693
I'm sorry, my dear.

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:24.059
I had to tell him.

01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:28.067
I can't live with it anymore.

01:09:28.167 --> 01:09:30.421
It's okay.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.453
Now, come on. You should be in bed.

01:09:34.553 --> 01:09:36.912
It's late.

01:10:14.918 --> 01:10:17.791
Are you angry with me?

01:10:18.091 --> 01:10:20.454
Don't be silly.

01:10:20.554 --> 01:10:23.844
I knew someone would find out
sooner or later.

01:10:23.944 --> 01:10:26.673
It was just a matter of time.

01:10:26.773 --> 01:10:30.010
I'm so sorry, my dear.

01:10:30.413 --> 01:10:34.919
I spent my whole life protecting you.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:39.828
But now the fallen angels are calling me.

01:10:41.283 --> 01:10:46.092
I can't take it to the grave,
or God won't save my soul.

01:10:46.192 --> 01:10:50.500
Don't worry about that now, Mother.
You just get some rest.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.311
You deserve it.

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:10.252
What the fuck are you doin'?

01:12:11.146 --> 01:12:12.934
Fuck.

01:12:13.034 --> 01:12:16.113
I know what my mother told you.

01:14:06.174 --> 01:14:09.412
You bitch. You fucking bitch!

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:13.410
You're fucking dead. Fucking dead!

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.849
You fucking bitch! You fuck!

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.242
Dead!

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.148
Fucking...

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:47.432
So, now you know.

01:17:58.521 --> 01:18:00.925
Why didn't you tell me?

01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:03.634
I couldn't.

01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:08.628
I didn't want to lose you.

01:18:12.866 --> 01:18:16.652
Why didn't you tell me
about Agnes and her daughter?

01:18:18.251 --> 01:18:22.280
I was scared the fallen angels
would come for me too.

01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:37.131
You know, I...

01:18:39.096 --> 01:18:41.456
I love you.

01:18:47.094 --> 01:18:49.692
I love you too.

01:18:52.605 --> 01:18:54.960
But when you love someone,

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.895
you have to set them free.

01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:04.889
Please don't go.

01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:08.605
I have to.

01:21:46.815 --> 01:21:49.458
- Mr. Jones?
- Yes.

01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:52.484
- Found the place, all right then?
- Yeah, no problem.

01:21:52.584 --> 01:21:55.964
Good. I'd thought I'd show you around the
house and make sure you're all settled in.

01:21:56.064 --> 01:21:58.488
Please, thank you.
