01:53.514 --> 01:54.724
Can you tell me why?

01:54.748 --> 01:56.593
I rather not say.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.728
I'll just put personal
reasons if that's okay.

01:58.752 --> 01:59.752
Sure.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.553
Thanks.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.823
I hope you feel better.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.801
Hello. Come in, come in.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.523
I can poach an egg
if you're hungry.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.547
No, I ate.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.349
Yeah. Oh...

03:05.519 --> 03:07.531
Victor, I'm sorry,
I'm not hungry.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.620
It's all right.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.800
Can I smoke?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.491
By that window.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.286
My grant money
is coming in soon.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.621
Karen, the woman
from the foundation,

03:31.645 --> 03:36.393
explained that there's always a delay and
they forgot to tell me to read the fine print.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.827
- So it's working out?
- Yes.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.518
I'm happy for you.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.900
Getting up like this
early in the morning,

03:43.924 --> 03:46.992
I've always hated it,
even though, I love morning.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.842
- Victor, The reason I'm here...
- Oh, yes I...

03:52.866 --> 03:55.694
I didn't even consider it.

03:55.718 --> 03:58.548
It's sort of unusual for you to
be here. I like that. I enjoy it.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.650
I suppose I'm nervous because...

04:00.674 --> 04:03.842
I'm here because I need
to tell you...

04:04.878 --> 04:06.545
It's over.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.759
Over? What's over?

04:09.783 --> 04:10.882
You and me.

04:18.759 --> 04:24.830
To say that I am saddened
by this development is...

04:27.568 --> 04:29.034
I don't know what it is.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.904
That makes sense to me.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.460
The boredom,

04:56.764 --> 05:02.067
the dull ticking
persistence of time,

05:04.705 --> 05:07.917
I will sit and I will write

05:07.941 --> 05:12.744
and I'll look up the road.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.847
The scene is sunny,

05:17.017 --> 05:18.984
it's a mid-afternoon idleness,

05:20.521 --> 05:23.533
car drives by
at a moderate pace,

05:23.557 --> 05:27.926
and I think perhaps
there's no reason for anything.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.633
But the yellow light
on the green leaves,

05:36.437 --> 05:38.036
there's a mystery and a power.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.940
I can't deny it.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.826
Did I ever tell you about the time I
broke a large stained-glass window?

05:49.850 --> 05:50.827
No.

05:50.851 --> 05:55.832
Well, I suppose there will be a
thousand stories I won't tell you now.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.856
Right.

05:59.693 --> 06:03.940
Can I suggest that perhaps you
reverse your decision?

06:03.964 --> 06:07.733
Victor, saying yes to that
question doesn't change anything.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.609
This... this...

06:18.846 --> 06:20.112
This feeling inside,

06:22.516 --> 06:26.151
I'm seeing now the time
is an emotional reality.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.866
We've known each other
for two months and, yet,

06:29.890 --> 06:34.971
my experience
and my reality within it

06:34.995 --> 06:38.475
stretches out
like what the French refer to as

06:38.499 --> 06:39.965
,

06:41.535 --> 06:43.835
That of a mirror
reflecting itself.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.571
That sounds very intense.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.843
Earthquake for me

06:53.113 --> 06:55.147
and a light breeze for you.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.853
The pain is
beginning to take hold.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.193
It's not that I don't care,
I just express myself differently.

07:20.073 --> 07:24.609
And I suppose I must ask
the obligatory question of why.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.191
You're not it for me.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.683
It's nothing against you
but that's the truth.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.695
A relationship is a
series of impressions, isn't it?

07:45.132 --> 07:48.867
Moments that define our identity
within a pairing.

07:50.103 --> 07:54.651
And these moments for you
perhaps me opening a door,

07:54.675 --> 07:56.775
drinking a glass of water.

07:58.579 --> 08:02.681
They didn't mesh
or gel or synthesize.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.116
When you leave,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.220
when you walk away,

08:10.757 --> 08:14.704
I'll be left in the morning light to
consider the emptiness and discontents

08:14.728 --> 08:16.161
of not only this day...

08:20.000 --> 08:21.867
The rest of existence.

08:23.971 --> 08:27.973
I think you're a really talented
poet and you're gonna do very well.

08:30.744 --> 08:34.123
I suppose this explains
Valentine's Day.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.025
What happened
on Valentine's Day?

08:36.049 --> 08:40.697
The poem I gave you, I wrote
for you, did you bring it?

08:40.721 --> 08:44.022
- What happened on Valentine's Day?
- First read it. Read it to me.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.743
"These words I write
are now irreversible,"

08:53.767 --> 08:56.746
they're chiseled
into the fabric of all we see,

08:56.770 --> 08:59.182
that tiny green speck
in the middle of a leaf...

08:59.206 --> 09:00.650
Bears their imprint.

09:00.674 --> 09:05.210
"The empty air is
filled with these words."

09:06.179 --> 09:09.014
- Victor, oh my God!
- Give me the paper.

09:11.151 --> 09:15.120
It's stained with my blood now.
It's more yours than it's ever been.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.260
You're not gonna cut yourself
anymore, are you?

09:23.830 --> 09:26.131
- You're concerned for me?
- Of course, I am.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.213
You love this, don't you?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.237
God!

09:32.906 --> 09:35.206
God, how did I let this happen?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.312
The pain, the pain!

09:50.958 --> 09:52.324
How's your hand feeling?

09:54.695 --> 09:55.695
Imperfect.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.679
How did I not see this?
How was I so blindsided?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.281
Relationships are unpredictable.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.238
That's what makes them
interesting.

10:08.976 --> 10:12.088
I suppose you're waiting to feel
comfortable with leaving.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.957
I am late for something.

10:13.981 --> 10:14.924
You are?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.493
I'm not gonna lie,
I have a busy day.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.063
Given what you've done, it would be
fairly irresponsible for me to leave you.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.287
So, yes,
I'm in a little bit of a bind.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.357
What do you have to do today?

10:27.227 --> 10:28.793
A bunch of errands.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.375
I'm a burden.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.159
You always go right
to that kind of thinking.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.047
Is that part
of your disinterest?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.532
See?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.040
Now this is an unhealthy territory
and I should probably leave.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.011
So leave.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.258
I don't think you
should be alone.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.060
I'll find somebody.

10:51.084 --> 10:55.987
- That's a good idea. Is there someone you can call?
- There's no one.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.003
Who's that guy you're always
seeing everywhere?

11:00.027 --> 11:02.260
We thought it was
some kind of cosmic signal.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.031
Fred.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.402
My sworn enemy.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.371
He betrayed me.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.285
He's a plagiarist
with a black soul.

11:16.309 --> 11:20.111
He stole a poem of mine
and tried to seduce my mother.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.925
Yeah, he doesn't seem
like he's very busy.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.293
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

11:24.317 --> 11:28.064
Natasha, I implore you
not to contact Fred.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.354
Don't worry, I'm not.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.770
Stay with them at least
a few hours, please.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.304
Yeah, no problem.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.863
You're real savior. I didn't
want to leave him alone.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.199
Fred is a true friend.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.168
Yes, he is.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.104
Goodbye, Victor.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.940
Goodbye, Natasha.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.018
Fuck, no, fuck.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.310
Hi.

12:14.334 --> 12:18.903
Stupid question, can I get
any gas for 66 cents?

12:20.107 --> 12:23.352
No, ah, are you out?

12:23.376 --> 12:28.079
Well, my car is not reliable
and it's all...

12:28.949 --> 12:31.060
I mean I could buy you some gas.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.350
You would do that?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.053
Sure, yeah.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.434
No, no, never mind, no.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.036
- I'm just not...
- Bye.

12:40.060 --> 12:45.430
- Look, if you change your mind...
- Yeah, thanks. Focus Natasha, focus.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.118
Yeah, come in.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.344
So what the hell were
you doing out there?

13:21.368 --> 13:22.845
What?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.347
You must have walked up
to the door five times.

13:24.371 --> 13:27.016
It took you like three minutes
before you even decided to knock.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.418
Oh, I didn't know
you were watching.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.210
Yeah. But why'd you do it?

13:33.914 --> 13:36.214
I thought maybe I had
something else.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.362
This have to do
with Valentine's Day?

13:39.386 --> 13:40.485
Valentine's Day?

13:41.421 --> 13:43.021
Did something happen?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.169
No.

13:47.193 --> 13:48.905
What do you mean?
What does that mean?

13:48.929 --> 13:51.396
I mean we didn't see each other.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.099
There wasn't anything else?

13:56.069 --> 13:57.469
Can you come over here
for a second?

13:59.439 --> 14:02.473
Just leave it there.
Fine, just get over here.

14:32.922 --> 14:35.518
- What's going on out here?
- I've been digging all day, I'm not done either.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.542
Why?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.177
Dispute with my landlord.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.448
- Your mother?
- I prefer not to think of her like that.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.560
I made steak.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.099
Salt, fork, knife.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.981
I didn't expect to eat.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.437
You don't want
the fucking steak?

15:19.219 --> 15:21.464
Are you gonna sit down?

15:21.488 --> 15:23.488
Just bear with me
'cause I'm confused.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.624
How does a person...

15:28.295 --> 15:30.406
Maybe not a person, I don't
really think of you as a person,

15:30.430 --> 15:33.576
you're more like a feeling
or a notion or a whim.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.279
You would have been called a
free spirit before psychology came in

15:36.303 --> 15:40.283
and now it's a coping mechanism
or projection

15:40.307 --> 15:42.151
or reaction formation
or whatever,

15:42.175 --> 15:45.488
but you, this area of mist that
I've been dating these past months

15:45.512 --> 15:49.558
who drifts without purpose in
some other worldly social plane

15:49.582 --> 15:52.161
who knows
no schedule or commitment,

15:52.185 --> 15:55.598
you made it a point of saying there was a
specific time and place that you wanted to see me.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.624
And as if that wasn't enough,
for some reason,

16:00.593 --> 16:04.339
some mystery
that I'll never solve,

16:04.363 --> 16:08.132
you walk up to my door several times back and
forth before you even consider to knock on it.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.636
I'm here because I have
to tell you it's over.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.577
It's over?

16:21.348 --> 16:22.325
Our relationship?

16:22.349 --> 16:23.414
Yes.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.286
That's... it's great.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.192
Terrific. Fan-fucking-tastic.

16:36.229 --> 16:40.176
You're unbelievable. It's over
just like that? Are you kidding me?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.644
How else would it work?

16:41.668 --> 16:42.678
I don't know.

16:42.702 --> 16:48.617
Maybe you say "I'm unhappy. Hey,
can we try working on this?"

16:48.641 --> 16:50.686
Some indication
that you're making an effort.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.288
There's nothing I
could have said.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.578
Bullshit!

16:55.648 --> 17:00.618
You know I'm not a woman and I
don't know what it's like to be a woman,

17:02.255 --> 17:05.166
but I would say that if I was
gonna break up with a man,

17:05.191 --> 17:07.603
the least you could do is do it
right after we've had sex.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.239
I'm... I'm relaxed,
I'm ready to listen.

17:10.262 --> 17:14.298
I'm not ticked the fuck
off by all this slippery sketchy behavior.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.468
God damn it.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.815
Is anything you've
ever said to been true?

17:24.411 --> 17:28.346
Ever? Once? Have you ever once
told me the truth?

17:30.583 --> 17:35.453
You came into my life
and lied and misled me

17:36.656 --> 17:39.490
and then at some arbitrary point
you just decide you're done.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.003
I'm being honest.

17:42.027 --> 17:43.739
Now you're being honest.
Now you are.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.364
And you know it's confusing
'cause this isn't like you.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.613
I know you don't like conflict and I
know you dread direct communication.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.481
So this isn't how
you would want to do this.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.218
No, no, no, you would just stop
talking to me until I figured it out.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.642
I'm absolutely certain of that.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.190
I'm trying to be more mature.

18:01.214 --> 18:05.594
Trying to mature.
Look at you trying to mature.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.763
Let me tell you something
about maturity though.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.354
It means a whole lot
of not getting what you want.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.691
Thank you for the steak.
It was very good.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.828
Was there anyone else?

18:18.431 --> 18:19.431
Anyone?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.800
Goddamn it, Natasha,
don't be cute.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.537
Yes and no, I guess.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.287
Do you realize what a shitty
answer that is to that question?

18:31.311 --> 18:34.457
That's got to be the shittiest possible
answer to that fucking question.

18:34.481 --> 18:38.727
Hey, Natasha, have you had another
guy's cock in your mouth recently?

18:38.751 --> 18:40.396
Jeez, let me think, yes and no.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.297
Yes and fucking no.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.200
I swear to God, it's like you're
trying to provoke me.

18:44.224 --> 18:48.204
- I'm not.
- I fucking hate you, you fucking bitch.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.738
You're the fucking worst.
Are you kidding me?

18:49.762 --> 18:52.240
Ah, you
cheating lying blond nightmare,

18:52.264 --> 18:55.584
you're everything I hate and despise and
I don't even want to think about you again.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.750
I'm sorry, just venting.

19:01.774 --> 19:02.874
I know.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.577
Come outside with me,
I have to dig some more.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.313
I'm actually late for something.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.563
I swear to God, I swear to God,
you are coming outside,

19:14.587 --> 19:17.455
I'm gonna ask you
some goddamn questions.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.728
Let's go!

19:48.588 --> 19:52.623
I am digging what's
known as a ha-ha.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.892
A ha-ha?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.506
It's like a ditch.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.497
It's one sided,
so it forms a wall.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.467
Basically, a ditch. I'm digging
a ditch. I'm a ditch digger.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.704
- You said it was called a ha-ha?
- Yes.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.410
As in ha ha. Isn't it funny how
life is so awful and pointless?

20:13.446 --> 20:14.979
Ha-ha.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.916
How about that?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.664
Why are you doing this?

20:21.688 --> 20:24.433
My neighbor has recently
acquired a goat.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.769
I didn't even
know it was legal to own goats.

20:26.793 --> 20:31.540
But the goat eats my landlord's plants and
she thinks that cheap fencing looks ugly.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.577
So, ha-ha.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.500
I can see why you're upset.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.971
Four Saturdays...

20:43.676 --> 20:47.823
We've been dating each other for several months
and I've only seen you on four Saturdays.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.692
- You counted?
- No.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.494
Four is a low enough number
that it doesn't require counting.

20:52.518 --> 20:56.699
If it were, say, 35,
maybe I would have had to count.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.501
And 35 by the way would have been
a reasonable number of Saturdays

20:59.525 --> 21:02.460
to spend with the person that
I've been seeing for several months.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.474
I don't even know where
to begin with that accusation.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.698
It's not an accusation,
it's a fact.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.646
Sometimes you were traveling.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.764
Sometimes you were sick.

21:12.788 --> 21:14.883
One time you're supposedly
visiting sister was supposedly sick.

21:14.907 --> 21:18.454
Are you saying I was lying about both
my sister visiting and her being sick?

21:18.478 --> 21:21.390
If you found out that she was sick
and you decided to lie about her visiting,

21:21.414 --> 21:23.726
is that some kind of mitigating
circumstance or something?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.628
I didn't realize.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.563
The text messages.

21:27.587 --> 21:33.969
I'll be sitting wherever minding my own business
and you'd start a conversation and I'd engage.

21:33.993 --> 21:37.461
Because goddammit, I like you.
We are dating.

21:38.698 --> 21:42.033
Go back and forth and then at
some arbitrary moment you stop.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.380
I get distracted.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.481
- Distracted by what?
- I don't know.

21:46.505 --> 21:48.584
- What's so distracting?
- I guess it's always different.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.876
It's like I'm looking at you
and you're here

21:53.613 --> 21:56.614
but at the same time it's like at
any second you can just drift away.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.528
It's like where are you when I'm
not looking at you?

21:59.552 --> 22:01.930
Do you even exist?
Are you even real?

22:01.954 --> 22:04.933
Are you even out there
in the world doing things?

22:04.957 --> 22:08.404
Being alive is very literal.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.062
You gotta be somewhere
doing something.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.832
So how have you managed
to avoid that?

22:15.702 --> 22:20.015
I'm sorry, I'm not literal,
I can't avoid being who I am.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.785
Dealing with you
is so frustrating,

22:22.809 --> 22:25.554
I get so angry sometimes
I want to kill myself.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.512
How would you do it? That's
always been my problem.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.549
What kind of response is that?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.830
Obviously, I'm not making
you feel better.

22:34.854 --> 22:38.033
I'm surprised you're still here.
You seem willing to put up with this.

22:38.057 --> 22:41.302
Your impression of me
as far as I can tell

22:41.326 --> 22:44.573
is that I go out of my way to
frustrate or hurt you or, I don't know.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.710
I wish that were the situation because
then at least there'd be some clear logic

22:47.734 --> 22:48.933
to all of your behavior.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.281
Probably right.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.650
There's no logic to it.
I can't explain it.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.674
So that's it?

22:56.542 --> 22:59.704
That's all there is?

22:59.728 --> 23:02.913
You don't know what you're doing
or why and things just happen?

23:03.683 --> 23:05.527
Can't argue with that.

23:05.551 --> 23:10.733
Are you aware of the expression in the economics
that there's no such thing as a free lunch?

23:10.757 --> 23:12.067
Maybe, I don't know.

23:12.091 --> 23:16.961
It means everything has a cost,
even things we think are free.

23:18.631 --> 23:19.942
That reminds me...

23:19.966 --> 23:24.101
And I know that this is gonna
come off like I'm the jerk here but,

23:24.971 --> 23:28.639
I really hate to ask,

23:29.776 --> 23:31.086
you, um,

23:31.110 --> 23:35.079
I need ten bucks. Do you
think I could borrow ten bucks?

23:35.948 --> 23:39.016
I'll pay you back with interest.
It's just it would really help.

23:41.754 --> 23:46.157
Breaks up with me and has
the audacity to ask for money.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.037
I let you vent though.

23:49.061 --> 23:52.007
Damn worthless piece of trash.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.064
Not even caring.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.734
Argh!

23:57.670 --> 23:59.797
Goddamn worthless life.

23:59.821 --> 24:01.950
Already shitty enough. Now I'm
dealing with this fucking bullshit!

24:01.974 --> 24:03.207
Fuck!

24:38.878 --> 24:39.977
What's your name?

24:40.780 --> 24:43.881
Natasha. What's yours?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.050
George.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.055
Do you want to get up
and keep walking?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.658
Which way should we go?

24:59.198 --> 25:00.831
You're not speaking?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.870
Can you please just make
a decision? I don't want to.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.889
Look, I don't want to make
a big thing about it,

25:13.913 --> 25:18.749
but it does kind of seem like you
don't remember that it's my birthday.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.091
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

25:31.163 --> 25:34.832
This is a paper bag with a
literal ball of trash inside of it.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.704
Are you really
that much of a dick?

25:42.141 --> 25:44.108
What are we doing? It's...

25:45.745 --> 25:48.846
You do
this stuff and it's like...

25:51.183 --> 25:54.997
Four-leaf clover,
good luck charm.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.887
I mentioned that months ago.

26:00.259 --> 26:03.861
How did you know?
I always feel so unlucky.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.997
Did you intentionally
make it blue?

26:13.105 --> 26:18.742
Well, since you're not speaking and now I have
my gift, I guess I don't need you anymore.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.356
It's beautiful and I
love it. Thank you.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.784
Is there anything I can
get for 66 cents?

26:48.808 --> 26:51.253
That is one sad question.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.277
- Okay, whatever.
- Hold on.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.218
Keep your money. Next.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.097
What?

27:14.867 --> 27:19.247
This will make you fat and this will
give you cancer, so don't do either.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.116
Okay.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.007
Now go away and leave me alone.

27:26.746 --> 27:30.147
Natasha, is that you?

27:30.916 --> 27:33.350
As I live and breathe.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.268
- Hi.
- How are you?

27:40.292 --> 27:41.937
Mwah!

27:41.961 --> 27:43.739
This is my friend Carla.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.907
Yes, her name is also Carla.

27:45.931 --> 27:49.945
Carla, Natasha here is
an unbelievable artist.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.913
One of Anton's people.

27:51.937 --> 27:57.119
She's a painter and a sculptress
and she's doing this project.

27:57.143 --> 28:01.356
She takes these photos of people
crying and she posts them.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.248
Oh, I showed you.
Do you remember?

28:05.184 --> 28:09.264
That sort of tableau with the
old woman with the bright dress

28:09.288 --> 28:13.268
and then the sort of muted tones
in the background.

28:13.292 --> 28:16.905
And that face, passion.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.207
That sad, desperate passion.

28:19.231 --> 28:24.012
I mean can you imagine
these lonely souls all around us

28:24.036 --> 28:29.384
dotting our landscape with their television
and their fast food, how do you even find them?

28:29.408 --> 28:32.443
I go to hospitals
and cemeteries.

28:34.413 --> 28:40.417
That answer, well, darkly comic,
shows an admirable pragmatism on your part.

28:41.353 --> 28:45.267
And Carla, Anton and all
his wisdom found a way

28:45.291 --> 28:47.803
to wrangle her
into an assistant position.

28:47.827 --> 28:52.908
But now he tells me that she's
become this elusive shadow presence.

28:52.932 --> 28:56.812
For my part,
I say I have patrons.

28:56.836 --> 28:59.597
I have galleries.

28:59.621 --> 29:02.384
Let's write your name
in the sky. And she says to me...

29:02.408 --> 29:05.854
I'm just dealing with some
personal issues at the moment.

29:05.878 --> 29:10.180
There's always dealing
going on and issues.

29:11.016 --> 29:14.412
Not... George, I hope.

29:14.436 --> 29:17.833
No. No, I was actually... I've
been feeling like I need to sort of...

29:17.857 --> 29:19.367
What? Need to what?

29:19.391 --> 29:21.492
I feel I need to commit
to George more.

29:22.228 --> 29:25.373
Commit? Is there somebody else?

29:25.397 --> 29:26.530
I'm sorting it out.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.979
- George is wonderful.
- Carla.

29:31.003 --> 29:35.005
This Carla, sorry. Can I talk
to you privately for a minute?

29:35.875 --> 29:36.974
Excuse us.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.248
I have...

29:44.150 --> 29:45.249
It's a long...

29:46.252 --> 29:47.484
My cash flow...

29:48.354 --> 29:50.298
Can I borrow ten bucks?

29:50.322 --> 29:56.872
You never cease to amaze. Of course, I
can help you. That's what I've been saying.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.640
I know. Thank you.

29:59.664 --> 30:02.410
I can't imagine how you manage
your life that these things happen to you.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.146
I'm working on it, I promise.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.314
I know, I know.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.350
Here's twenty. Call me.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.384
- I will.
- Seriously.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.420
I will. Thank you.
Thank you. Bye, other Carla.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.311
And stop hiding.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.387
Argh...

30:24.223 --> 30:26.256
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.077
Uh-oh.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.434
- Hi.
- Hello.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.148
Ten dollars' worth
of gas please.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.405
Sure. Ah...

30:45.311 --> 30:47.622
This is fake.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.958
- What?
- Yeah. Just forget I said anything. Um...

30:49.982 --> 30:52.427
No, wait. How can you tell?

30:52.451 --> 30:56.932
Well, the texture is off and if you look
at it through the light, there is no strip.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.033
You've got to be kidding me.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.136
- I'm sorry.
- How is that even something you're looking for?

31:01.160 --> 31:03.004
I should've pretended
not to notice that.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.472
I mean they come in
every now and again

31:04.496 --> 31:06.341
and they get mad at us whenever
we accept them.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.211
You know, it's not a big deal. Like,
honestly, I can just take it.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.979
No, it's fine.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.636
Look, um,

31:13.505 --> 31:15.350
it seems like you're just
having a rough day.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.052
I mean just
let me buy it for you.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.442
No, because...

31:19.378 --> 31:20.388
No.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.557
No, look,
you listen to me, okay?

31:22.581 --> 31:25.560
I just know that you're in grad
school for law or medicine

31:25.584 --> 31:27.978
or even
something like architecture,

31:28.002 --> 31:30.398
it's a little bit cooler and you just have
this stupid job to pay down your debt

31:30.422 --> 31:32.800
and I walk in and you think,
"Oh, look at this,

31:32.824 --> 31:35.203
what a nice little story to say how we
met and fell in love and got married."

31:35.227 --> 31:37.973
And we can laugh when a grandpa
asks us what a gas station is.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.574
But no,
today that will not be who I am.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.087
And it's gonna slow me down

31:42.111 --> 31:44.600
but maybe the universe is
telling me that's what I need now.

31:44.624 --> 31:47.115
So I'm gonna park my car, I'm gonna go get
my bike and I'm gonna do what I need to do.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.439
- I mean, did you start med school...
- Bye.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.441
What?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.311
Uh, I tell you what,

31:55.147 --> 31:58.126
you hear a lot these days
about the feminism and all that.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.685
But if you ask me, women
never change one bit.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.132
Guess I wouldn't know.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.555
You will one day.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.137
Pack of American Spirits.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.161
Yeah.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.382
It's open.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.392
Meet you in the middle?

32:44.063 --> 32:45.195
It's a deal.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.278
Bite my lips.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.561
Please.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.419
Please,
I'll do anything. Please.

33:27.473 --> 33:30.307
Tom, we need to talk.

33:33.145 --> 33:36.091
Are you breaking up with me?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.115
Yes.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.132
I thought something's
going on after Valentine's Day.

33:44.156 --> 33:47.369
Wait, what? What do you know?

33:47.393 --> 33:48.670
You called me. Seemed upset.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.372
What did I say?

33:50.396 --> 33:52.540
Oh, to be honest, I was pretty
out of it as well.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.663
Oh.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.478
All right, sorry.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.930
So this was...

33:58.954 --> 34:01.383
The last guy I broke up with suggested
right after sex was a good time.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.650
Well, it's one idea.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.719
Did this make it easier for you?

34:04.743 --> 34:07.137
Would've been fun.

34:07.161 --> 34:09.556
Yeah. I have a feeling that guy
would have been upset no matter what.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.659
I do feel like I didn't really
get to know you though.

34:11.683 --> 34:16.130
It's an interesting time in
my life. But I felt I owed you.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.621
Sex, apparently.

34:20.692 --> 34:26.263
Obviously, we won't pretend
to be friends but you seem okay.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.543
Yep, fine.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.545
Is it okay if I go?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.768
Yeah, sure.

34:32.538 --> 34:33.538
Um...

34:34.440 --> 34:35.639
Have a nice day.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.309
You, too.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.794
Hello, Kim.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.278
Hey.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.447
What the fuck, I thought
you were locked out.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.615
What the hell was up
with you on Valentine's Day?

35:07.639 --> 35:09.484
Did something happen?

35:09.508 --> 35:11.453
I think you had a lot to drink.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.776
I'm moving out.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.461
Apparently, your check is
ready over at Anton's.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.897
What? Really? How do you know?

35:22.921 --> 35:26.334
Well, Debra told me that Anton told her that
he hasn't been able to get in touch with you.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.436
So, Debra talked
to you instead of me?

35:28.460 --> 35:30.572
- Well, for a talking.
- When was this?

35:30.596 --> 35:32.440
Oh, like today.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.309
And I was saying that I didn't
know what was going on with you.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.212
But I thought that it could be
something like serious maybe.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.247
Are you spying on me?

35:41.929 --> 35:44.563
Everybody just wants to know
what's going on with you.

35:44.587 --> 35:47.222
I mean, you've been more and more
private or something and I don't know,

35:47.246 --> 35:50.458
I just want to make sure it's
nothing like really bad.

35:50.482 --> 35:54.551
You haven't like found God
or anything, have you?

35:55.387 --> 35:57.699
Finding God would not be
a change for me.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.634
As I've told you many times
and you are well aware

35:59.658 --> 36:01.636
that I believe in a vengeful
and spiteful God.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.806
No, no, no, I mean like have you
found God with like other people?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.475
You're not worried
about like drugs?

36:07.499 --> 36:10.845
- What was going on with you that night?
- I don't understand. Who cares?

36:11.937 --> 36:15.450
If it's not drugs
and it's not a cult,

36:15.474 --> 36:18.419
I mean, you don't post anything
unless it's like an art project

36:18.443 --> 36:19.943
and you disappear
for days at a time.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.913
This is just honest concern.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.617
- You were never locked out.
- Give me something.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.759
George and I took a break
a couple of months ago.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.672
Okay.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.641
So I started seeing this guy.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.676
- Yeah?
- And it was really casual.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.711
- Uh-huh.
- Then I met this other guy and I liked him

36:43.735 --> 36:45.746
and since things were so casual,

36:45.770 --> 36:48.250
I didn't really feel it was
necessary to tell anybody anything.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.386
And then you started seeing
George again, right?

36:51.410 --> 36:53.510
Yeah, at one point
that happened.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.714
What is that? What is going on?

36:58.450 --> 37:01.763
It was a complete fluke and I
was just in a place in my life

37:01.787 --> 37:04.782
where I was really open
to the possibilities

37:04.806 --> 37:08.086
and that combined with the crazy flukish
streak of meeting men I was interested in.

37:08.694 --> 37:11.673
Right. But what are you saying?

37:11.697 --> 37:14.809
I met a couple other guys
and started dating them.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.344
Two guys?

37:16.368 --> 37:16.945
Yeah.

37:16.969 --> 37:20.448
Plus the other two
guys you're seeing?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.449
Yeah.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.672
And George?

37:23.375 --> 37:23.952
Yeah.

37:23.976 --> 37:26.754
You're dating five guys
at the same time?

37:26.778 --> 37:28.645
Only for a couple of months.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.949
You know I had a feeling it
was something like this.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.898
You're my roommate,
you're bound to know something, I guess.

37:36.922 --> 37:41.736
Like, I am impressed and also a little
disturbed. You might have a problem.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.904
You think?

37:42.928 --> 37:45.806
I can't even imagine.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.710
The thing is, unless you tell a man
you're not dating, he thinks you're dating.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.945
And I just didn't
want to let anybody down.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.870
I've such a hard time telling
people unpleasant things.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.674
So, is one of them Anton?

37:58.644 --> 37:59.976
No. Why?

38:00.679 --> 38:01.889
Oh, why not?

38:01.913 --> 38:04.359
I mean I know he's
a little bit older than you,

38:04.383 --> 38:05.960
and might be like
your boss or whatever,

38:05.984 --> 38:08.518
but it's totally
something you should consider.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.800
Fine. You could just be his
flavor of the month, but so what?

38:12.824 --> 38:15.285
He took Sara
all over the world with him.

38:15.309 --> 38:17.772
He did have a meltdown when they were in
some square in like Sao Paulo or some place

38:17.796 --> 38:19.774
where he was like screaming
at her for being a whore

38:19.798 --> 38:22.377
and these old ladies were
watching and crossing themselves.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.712
And now she's some
sort of Catholic because of it.

38:24.736 --> 38:30.385
But come on, restaurants, trips,
clothing, it's completely worth it.

38:30.409 --> 38:33.621
And, besides, if he's into you, then
it's definitely way more legit than her.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.706
I mean she never
has anything to say

38:35.730 --> 38:37.792
and the attraction has to be about
how her boobs are always on display.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.894
Every time she talks to me,
all I can do is stare at them.

38:39.918 --> 38:44.599
They're just so jiggly and... and
fluffy and like really distracting.

38:44.623 --> 38:48.703
You know it's nothing sexual or anything
but sometimes I want to take a nap on them.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.628
Where is this conversation?

38:52.698 --> 38:54.876
You're dating five guys.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.644
Unbelievable.

38:56.668 --> 38:57.979
I'm really only dating two now.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.614
What happened?

38:59.638 --> 39:00.815
I broke up with three of them.

39:00.839 --> 39:01.883
When?

39:01.907 --> 39:02.972
Today.

39:03.975 --> 39:04.975
All today?

39:05.711 --> 39:06.910
Do you have any cash?

39:07.946 --> 39:08.946
Um...

39:15.987 --> 39:16.987
Ah!

39:18.590 --> 39:20.702
Like three dollars.

39:20.726 --> 39:21.825
Can I borrow it?

39:27.733 --> 39:31.134
I want you to know that I care.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.071
Listen, I'm late for something.

39:35.874 --> 39:36.851
Come over here.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.876
- Kim.
- Just come over here.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.712
Bring it in.

39:44.883 --> 39:49.731
You are loved
by no one else than by me.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.216
Please stop.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.702
And you can date as many men as
you want and I will never judge you.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.004
This is unpleasant for me,
and I would like to leave.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.073
You will not only endure,

39:59.097 --> 40:00.663
you will prevail.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.478
You need more help than I do.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.612
I'm here for you.

40:04.636 --> 40:05.668
Okay, bye, Kim.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.518
Debra.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.530
Hey, Natasha.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.664
Is he in?

40:23.688 --> 40:24.766
Who?

40:24.790 --> 40:25.733
Anton.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.123
Oh, great, duh.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.537
Is he?

40:29.561 --> 40:30.972
He's in the back.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.908
I just came to get my check
and then I'm gonna go.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.132
Cool. I'll look for it.

40:39.905 --> 40:40.905
Oh.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.087
I think it's in the back.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.789
Seriously? Can you like...

40:47.813 --> 40:49.846
Don't worry, I'll cover for you.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.978
Just show me the picture
because I don't believe you.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.997
The note said 114.

41:14.021 --> 41:17.039
If he's wearing the hat, it's
not the right one. Show me.

41:17.843 --> 41:18.875
Here.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.115
- He's wearing the hat.
- That's what I told you.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.818
That is right.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.032
What do you want me to do?

41:31.056 --> 41:32.689
He's wearing a hat.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.659
- Fucking hat!
- Anton.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.176
Go with it. It's fine.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.267
That's what I was going
to do anyway.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.052
Did you get it?

41:51.076 --> 41:53.943
- You were hiding, huh?
- Come on, Debra.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.983
Great. Terrific. Thank you.
See when I see you.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.786
There she is.

42:04.890 --> 42:05.955
Hey, Anton.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.059
Just picking up my check.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.729
You're coming back here or what?

42:21.907 --> 42:23.006
Close the door.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.762
You got a valid passport?

42:34.786 --> 42:35.997
Yeah.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.865
You avoiding me or something?

42:37.889 --> 42:40.635
I just came to get my check.
I didn't know you were here.

42:40.659 --> 42:43.126
I called, I texted,
I didn't hear anything.

42:44.162 --> 42:47.964
I was gonna call today. I was
running around and then forgot.

42:54.139 --> 42:56.739
I'm leaving for Rome
tonight for a shoot.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.242
I'll be there for a week or so.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.156
After that is Dubai,
then Hong Kong.

43:02.180 --> 43:06.060
There's a guy in Rome

43:06.084 --> 43:10.153
that can assist me
or it can be you

43:13.091 --> 43:14.290
if you leave tonight.

43:15.827 --> 43:17.504
Tonight is soon.

43:17.528 --> 43:19.408
It's only soon because you
never got back to me.

43:20.131 --> 43:22.198
I called you what,
a week ago the first time?

43:23.268 --> 43:26.803
Anton that's really amazing
and, of course, I want to go.

43:27.806 --> 43:28.716
Great.

43:28.740 --> 43:30.334
Ah...

43:30.358 --> 43:31.953
Dubai has some visa
bullshit we have to work on,

43:31.977 --> 43:36.958
but otherwise you should have
time to get what you need in order.

43:36.982 --> 43:38.915
I don't think I can though.

43:41.052 --> 43:45.833
- Are you suggesting that I should have to convince you...
- No.

43:45.857 --> 43:48.035
- To take this amazing opportunity?
- No, of course, not.

43:48.059 --> 43:50.360
I'm not even sure you deserve
it at this point.

43:51.196 --> 43:53.062
I understand if you
feel that way.

43:54.833 --> 43:57.812
Is that your way of saying
you don't want to come?

43:57.836 --> 43:59.714
No, it isn't...

43:59.738 --> 44:03.339
- it's... it's not about what I want.
- Yes, it is. What do you want?

44:04.242 --> 44:06.009
How long do I have to decide?

44:06.845 --> 44:08.255
Let's see...

44:08.279 --> 44:12.048
I think if you let me know
by let's say...

44:13.018 --> 44:14.417
eight o'clock tonight,

44:17.222 --> 44:19.155
I think you'd have
a fighting chance.

44:22.827 --> 44:26.273
I want to go.

44:26.297 --> 44:29.744
Well, you soon learn in life that
it's not what people claim they want,

44:29.768 --> 44:31.234
it's what they actually do.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.170
Right.

44:36.775 --> 44:39.920
Maybe I'll see you tonight.
Maybe I'll see you when I get back.

44:39.944 --> 44:42.245
Okay. Thanks.

44:43.782 --> 44:45.381
I hope I see you, Natasha.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.325
Hey.

45:00.065 --> 45:02.777
You're not like actually hungry
or anything, are you?

45:02.801 --> 45:04.979
Uh, not crazy hungry, I guess.

45:05.003 --> 45:07.948
- Let's just... just walk.
- Cool.

45:07.972 --> 45:11.285
- I'm sorry I'm not hungry.
- Not a problem.

45:11.309 --> 45:14.321
I do that stuff, though. I
say let's meet here at this time and eat

45:14.345 --> 45:16.791
and then I show up late
and say I'm not hungry.

45:16.815 --> 45:19.160
What can I say? I hate myself.

45:19.184 --> 45:21.228
I've been meaning to talk
to you about that.

45:21.252 --> 45:24.420
- Sure you'll agree soon enough.
- Me? Never.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.390
God.

45:27.859 --> 45:28.903
Oh, God.

45:28.927 --> 45:30.093
What is it?

45:33.198 --> 45:34.124
Oh God.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.076
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

45:35.100 --> 45:38.979
Are you... are you serious?
Should I call 911?

45:39.003 --> 45:42.883
No, no, no, no, don't do that. It's not a
heart attack. I just... I need to sit down.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.340
Of course. Here.

45:45.844 --> 45:47.977
I told you those are
gonna make you fat.

45:48.980 --> 45:52.927
- You know her?
- Yes. I mean, no, but yes.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.428
God, I'm freaking out.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.297
Relax, just breathe.

45:56.321 --> 45:57.965
I think this is a panic attack.

45:57.989 --> 46:00.101
Oh, there was something
on the TV with this guy,

46:00.125 --> 46:02.236
knew exactly what to do
when his girl had a panic attack.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.371
- Was that... was that a documentary?
- No.

46:04.395 --> 46:07.942
So it could be right, so it
could be wrong, and you don't remember?

46:07.966 --> 46:09.486
It might be good
that I don't remember.

46:13.037 --> 46:14.148
I think I'm better.

46:14.172 --> 46:18.374
My plan was to distract you
with my incompetence.

46:19.344 --> 46:21.210
I suppose it sort of worked.

46:24.415 --> 46:27.250
Hopefully,
this doesn't return you to...

46:28.386 --> 46:32.188
Anyway, is this at all connected to the
conversation we had at the bar last week?

46:34.292 --> 46:36.359
Did I tell you
what I really like about you?

46:37.195 --> 46:39.440
I don't really know
how to take compliments.

46:39.464 --> 46:40.464
You're mean.

46:41.199 --> 46:42.877
Fine, tell me.

46:42.901 --> 46:45.401
I just did. I really like
that you're mean.

46:46.171 --> 46:49.505
I'm pretty sure that's not a compliment
'cause I'm having no trouble with that.

46:52.911 --> 46:55.055
Most people think it's helpful
to be around people

46:55.079 --> 46:57.380
who say nice things,
which has an obvious logic.

46:58.116 --> 47:00.094
But it wasn't
until I met you that I realized

47:00.118 --> 47:03.553
that being around someone who says
mean things is actually much healthier.

47:04.422 --> 47:09.503
You criticize me or stuff I do and I
think you're right, I need to do better.

47:09.527 --> 47:11.372
Nice people are totally
unhelpful, though,

47:11.396 --> 47:14.275
because they only make you think
everything is fine when it never is.

47:14.299 --> 47:17.077
What if I'm holding you back
with all of my negativity though?

47:17.101 --> 47:19.145
Then I'm weak.

47:19.169 --> 47:21.215
I'm just supposed to be negative
all the time, that's my role?

47:21.239 --> 47:22.917
You're not supposed
to do anything.

47:22.941 --> 47:25.152
It sounds like I am.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.388
It sounds like I have to be constantly
putting you down or sabotaging your dreams.

47:27.412 --> 47:29.957
I won't go that far,
it's not like we are married or anything.

47:29.981 --> 47:31.458
Oh my God.

47:31.482 --> 47:32.393
Are you upset?

47:32.417 --> 47:34.962
Yes. And deeply disturbed.

47:34.986 --> 47:37.097
It's the worst
compliment possible.

47:37.121 --> 47:39.721
And you have a deranged view of
what makes a healthy relationship.

47:44.495 --> 47:45.939
I know you did it.

47:45.963 --> 47:48.083
- You're saying I did what you say I do.
- Didn't you?

47:48.967 --> 47:50.945
You know I can box your ears
from where I'm sitting.

47:50.969 --> 47:53.347
You keep threatening like that
and I had to look up what it means.

47:53.371 --> 47:56.305
- It's when you hit someone on both...
- Obviously I looked it up.

47:57.442 --> 48:00.270
Now who's mean?

48:00.294 --> 48:03.734
I wonder where that went out of style. It
seems like such a good way to attack someone.

48:04.082 --> 48:06.560
We can start getting into bar
fights, do it all the time.

48:06.584 --> 48:08.417
We'd be like the new
Bonnie and Clyde?

48:09.120 --> 48:11.198
I think they had sex problems.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.123
We could be like them
without the sex problems.

48:16.461 --> 48:17.593
How do you want that?

48:18.563 --> 48:20.074
Sounds bad.

48:20.098 --> 48:21.976
So that's a definite no, right?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.194
I'd think about it.

48:24.218 --> 48:26.413
Great. Next time someone asks how
things are going with you, I can say,

48:26.437 --> 48:30.251
"Awesome, we're thinking about
rowdy bar fights and sex problems."

48:30.275 --> 48:31.385
That's nice.

48:31.409 --> 48:32.586
It is, isn't?

48:32.610 --> 48:34.110
Yeah.

48:46.257 --> 48:47.401
I don't want to freak you out.

48:47.425 --> 48:48.457
What?

48:49.160 --> 48:51.138
I think we should.

48:51.162 --> 48:54.275
- You're not...
- No. No. No.

48:54.299 --> 48:57.611
- Okay. Because that...
- What am I, some psycho?

48:57.635 --> 48:59.179
You never know.

48:59.203 --> 49:01.504
- I mean, right, not that but...
- Oh.

49:03.408 --> 49:05.219
Okay, just to recap,
I started talking

49:05.243 --> 49:08.188
and I thought maybe you thought
I was talking about marriage.

49:08.212 --> 49:12.559
- I thought you were breaking up with me.
- No, okay, forget it.

49:12.583 --> 49:16.096
- Forget it all? We're not talking about anything?
- No, I mean... Yeah.

49:16.120 --> 49:20.456
We could or you could,
life moves on, you can move in.

49:21.192 --> 49:24.126
All I'm saying is growth,
progress. I think it's time.

49:27.098 --> 49:28.431
That's really beautiful.

49:30.301 --> 49:33.480
There's a feeling that I get that
usually goes away or never arrives

49:33.504 --> 49:35.604
and I want to continue that.

49:36.474 --> 49:39.453
It's warm. I'm bad at this.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.488
Yeah, you really are.

49:41.512 --> 49:42.512
Thanks.

49:43.214 --> 49:45.326
I need to smoke a cigarette.

49:45.350 --> 49:46.593
- I didn't mean to...
- Winston,

49:46.617 --> 49:49.396
you didn't say anything
you shouldn't have said.

49:49.420 --> 49:51.187
But you need a cigarette?

49:52.490 --> 49:54.390
I don't want to say
anything I don't mean.

49:55.660 --> 49:57.326
Okay, I appreciate it.

50:07.205 --> 50:09.416
Hey, could you not smoke
in front of the entrance?

50:09.440 --> 50:11.501
Why?

50:11.525 --> 50:14.245
You're smoking right in front of
the entrance. Just go to the corner.

50:14.345 --> 50:15.345
Okay.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.447
It's a city ordinance.

50:29.427 --> 50:30.459
George.

50:33.464 --> 50:35.197
I thought you were out of town.

50:35.733 --> 50:37.333
I got back early.

50:38.136 --> 50:39.602
Let's do something tomorrow.

50:40.304 --> 50:41.404
Why not right now?

50:42.140 --> 50:43.717
I'm busy.

50:43.741 --> 50:45.285
Doing what?

50:45.309 --> 50:47.688
Can you not tomorrow?

50:47.712 --> 50:49.278
Come with me right now.

50:50.181 --> 50:52.214
I can't. I'm sorry.

50:53.651 --> 50:54.628
Fine.

50:54.652 --> 50:56.619
I'll call you tomorrow.

50:57.288 --> 50:59.333
Anton's having
a Valentine's Day party.

50:59.357 --> 51:00.357
And?

51:03.494 --> 51:04.494
Right.

51:08.766 --> 51:10.344
We can go.

51:10.368 --> 51:11.434
Yeah?

51:12.170 --> 51:13.213
Yeah.

51:13.237 --> 51:14.537
That'd be nice.

51:16.641 --> 51:18.507
Sure. Yeah.

51:21.546 --> 51:23.813
I'm sorry I can't go
with you right now.

51:28.719 --> 51:30.553
Nothing to be sorry about.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.426
I'll call you tomorrow.

51:48.439 --> 51:49.439
There you are.

51:50.808 --> 51:52.441
Are we going inside?

51:54.212 --> 51:55.277
We don't have to.

51:57.415 --> 52:00.761
I have to think about what you said,
so I can't say anything right now.

52:00.785 --> 52:03.519
Hey, that's a... that's fine.

52:04.755 --> 52:05.821
Thank you.

52:07.258 --> 52:08.258
I'll pay.

52:09.227 --> 52:10.227
Cool.

52:18.769 --> 52:20.569
It is about that.

52:21.506 --> 52:24.384
I wasn't pressing you or
anything. It's really not a big deal.

52:24.408 --> 52:25.652
It did get me thinking.

52:25.676 --> 52:27.788
It's have to do
with Valentine's Day.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.823
They called you too, huh?

52:29.847 --> 52:32.314
Uh, yeah, we spoke.

52:35.386 --> 52:37.731
It's right for you and me
to want those things.

52:37.755 --> 52:40.501
People shouldn't be scared about
stuff the way that they are but...

52:40.525 --> 52:41.525
Oh.

52:43.327 --> 52:44.927
It wouldn't be right of me
to lie to you.

52:45.763 --> 52:47.407
I don't want to lie anymore.

52:47.431 --> 52:49.765
What have you been lying about?

52:52.270 --> 52:53.335
Natasha.

52:54.672 --> 52:57.339
I can't believe I'm thinking
about telling you this.

52:58.776 --> 53:00.454
I don't need to hear it.

53:00.478 --> 53:02.623
You're just
totally nuts basically.

53:02.647 --> 53:05.881
You're right, I won't tell you.
I've been dating four other guys.

53:06.717 --> 53:07.783
What?

53:08.619 --> 53:10.519
Darn it, I said that.

53:12.290 --> 53:13.923
We always used a condom, right?

53:14.792 --> 53:16.537
Yeah, we did, okay.

53:16.561 --> 53:18.827
Just trying to think of all
the potential risks here.

53:19.730 --> 53:23.532
- Do you hate me? You really hate me, right?
- I'm fine really, I am.

53:24.468 --> 53:27.447
I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

53:27.471 --> 53:29.283
Everything is great!

53:29.307 --> 53:30.884
I'm so fucking mad!

53:30.908 --> 53:34.510
Why does it all
have to be so terrible?

53:35.346 --> 53:37.691
Fuck this! I fucking give up!
I fucking quit!

53:37.715 --> 53:39.515
- Quit what?
- Life!

53:42.520 --> 53:45.332
I didn't want this.

53:45.356 --> 53:48.769
I just wanted a normal thing.
That's all.

53:48.793 --> 53:50.826
I'm so tired.

53:51.562 --> 53:55.642
- I really am sorry.
- How could you do this to all of us?

53:55.666 --> 53:57.844
- I didn't mean it.
- I never want to see you again.

53:57.868 --> 53:59.746
- I understand.
- When will I see you again?

53:59.770 --> 54:01.481
- Never.
- I love you.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.917
- I'm horrible.
- You're the only person I'll ever truly love.

54:03.941 --> 54:07.888
- Pretend I don't exist.
- My life would be so much easier if I never met you.

54:07.912 --> 54:10.457
I think this is where we
go our separate ways.

54:10.481 --> 54:11.481
Good.

54:13.884 --> 54:14.950
You'll be back!

54:15.653 --> 54:17.798
You love me more than you know!

54:17.822 --> 54:19.788
You'll be back! I know you will!

54:31.902 --> 54:33.614
Slow down, hear me out.

54:33.638 --> 54:35.582
Winston...

54:35.606 --> 54:37.551
Natasha just... I'm gonna say
something, okay?

54:37.575 --> 54:39.719
And just listen.

54:39.743 --> 54:41.888
Those other guys,
whoever they are, they're trash.

54:41.912 --> 54:44.680
You're not gonna do better
than me. It's not possible.

54:45.416 --> 54:46.976
I have to go.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.562
You just told me you're
seeing four other guys.

54:48.586 --> 54:49.796
You want to run away?

54:49.820 --> 54:52.499
I'm feeling a lot
of things right now.

54:52.523 --> 54:54.768
I can't lie one of them is rage.

54:54.792 --> 54:59.640
There's also a deep and intense sadness,
but love is in there, too.

54:59.664 --> 55:01.375
Hey, man, is this your car?

55:01.399 --> 55:03.142
Yeah, one second.

55:03.166 --> 55:04.911
- You should move your car.
- What I want to say is this,

55:04.935 --> 55:07.848
I see a better person in you
and I think you know it.

55:07.872 --> 55:09.616
You're seeing other guys, right?

55:09.640 --> 55:11.852
I've seen you
every weekend for how long?

55:11.876 --> 55:14.988
- Come on. Look, I want to get inside.
- Yeah, just put it on ice buddy.

55:15.012 --> 55:16.756
- I have to go.
- I'm...

55:16.780 --> 55:18.525
I looked up major female artists
and their marriages.

55:18.549 --> 55:20.660
Now granted, a bunch
of them are lesbians,

55:20.684 --> 55:22.796
but a lot of them ended up marrying
other artists and getting divorced

55:22.820 --> 55:24.747
except Sally Mann. You know her?

55:24.771 --> 55:26.700
- Yeah, but...
- Yeah. I actually liked her stuff from any...

55:26.724 --> 55:28.535
More than anyone else's
from what I saw.

55:28.559 --> 55:30.871
She married a lawyer
and they're still together.

55:30.895 --> 55:32.973
- Move your car.
- Just one minute!

55:32.997 --> 55:34.675
And he's probably like me.

55:34.699 --> 55:37.411
He goes to these galleries
and he feels out of place,

55:37.435 --> 55:40.079
although I liked
a lot of the stuff.

55:40.103 --> 55:42.783
The guy with the pelican videos,
the screaming lady, the giant foot.

55:43.607 --> 55:45.752
Fine, all your friends are
pretentious and terrible!

55:45.776 --> 55:47.754
I don't care. Mine are
all soulless yuppies!

55:47.778 --> 55:51.558
The point is you make me
entertained and I make you reliable.

55:51.582 --> 55:53.126
It's great.

55:53.150 --> 55:54.695
So you should cancel your plans
and come with me.

55:54.719 --> 55:57.030
Is the speech over?
I'm trying to get home!

55:57.054 --> 55:58.832
Haven't you ever been in love?

55:58.856 --> 56:00.967
So? I have to still park though.

56:00.991 --> 56:03.659
Stay, please.

56:04.729 --> 56:08.664
I'm sorry, I don't
feel that way.

56:09.734 --> 56:10.734
Okay.

56:11.702 --> 56:12.768
Okay.

56:13.738 --> 56:14.870
That's what I've got.

56:15.706 --> 56:16.706
Go.

56:17.875 --> 56:18.941
I'll move my car.

56:19.844 --> 56:20.909
Thank you.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.915
Love is dead! You happy now?

56:27.618 --> 56:28.995
Frankly, yes!

56:29.019 --> 56:30.619
Get the hell out of my yard!

56:32.089 --> 56:34.089
I know deep down
you're a good guy.

57:02.887 --> 57:05.020
- Delivery for Kim...
- Do you need a signature?

57:07.525 --> 57:08.525
Here you go.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.738
- Thanks.
- Happy Valentine's Day!

57:11.762 --> 57:12.762
You, too.

57:20.671 --> 57:22.738
Kim, Brandon sent flowers.

57:23.974 --> 57:27.943
Oh, goodie... hello? Natasha.

57:30.614 --> 57:35.595
<i>Natasha, I again
apologize for not using text messages.</i>

57:35.619 --> 57:39.132
<i>I cannot bring myself to degrade
language in such a manner.</i>

57:39.156 --> 57:45.093
<i>Nevertheless, I would like to see you
today as custom dictates. Yours, Victor.</i>

58:46.824 --> 58:47.956
One second.

58:49.693 --> 58:50.737
Hey, stranger.

58:50.761 --> 58:52.138
Hey, Natasha.

58:52.162 --> 58:53.240
Hey, Brandon.

58:53.264 --> 58:57.143
- Guess who we ran into when we were out?
- Mussolini.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.980
George. He said you two haven't
talked much recently.

59:00.004 --> 59:02.298
I've been busy.

59:02.322 --> 59:04.618
You two should totally come
with us to Anton's party tonight.

59:04.642 --> 59:05.841
What's Mussolini?

59:07.244 --> 59:11.892
- What did he say?
- Hmm, I don't remember.

59:11.916 --> 59:13.026
Are you serious?

59:13.050 --> 59:14.628
So you do care.

59:14.652 --> 59:16.029
Yes, Kim, I care.
Did I say I didn't?

59:16.053 --> 59:18.198
Well, you don't talk to him
but then you care.

59:18.222 --> 59:19.966
I'm trying
to figure out what's going on.

59:19.990 --> 59:22.736
- Mussolini is seafood.
- Brandon, shut up.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.170
Ask her about the...

59:24.194 --> 59:27.874
Did you happen to get a box of
chocolates with those flowers?

59:27.898 --> 59:29.932
Hmm, I don't think so.

59:30.668 --> 59:31.878
That's some bullshit.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.235
What did George say?

59:34.204 --> 59:35.971
He said he'd think about it.

59:36.674 --> 59:39.219
- That's it?
- Yeah. And then he walked away.

59:39.243 --> 59:41.788
He's like weird and moody,
just like you like them.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.245
Okay. Bye, Kim.

59:43.948 --> 59:45.258
Please, come with us tonight.

59:45.282 --> 59:46.660
We'll see.

59:46.684 --> 59:47.861
Later, Natasha.

59:47.885 --> 59:49.184
You're yelling in my ear.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.132
Brandon, let's go.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.702
Tonight it's gonna be awesome.

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.286
Just don't talk
for the next hour.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.190
George.

01:01:35.325 --> 01:01:38.260
Are you avoiding or stalking?

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:40.996
I thought you were avoiding me.

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:43.432
I'm not doing anything.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:46.268
Are you going somewhere?

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:49.971
You're at my house.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:53.252
You ran into Kim.

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:56.076
You talked about the party. Obviously,
you knew that she would tell me.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:01:59.893
What do you want?

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:02.417
I want to know
what's going on, George.

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:08.123
It seems like
you're not going to...

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:11.026
I don't know, whatever.

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:14.624
I could say the same
thing about you.

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.768
If I've been that way, it's only been
because I thought that's what you wanted.

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:27.375
It seems like we're two people
standing in the dark talking about nothing.

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:31.607
What am I supposed
to do with that?

01:02:31.631 --> 01:02:34.631
You say these things like it's the
easiest thing in the world to understand.

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:37.499
I think you need
to make some choices.

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:42.457
Everybody has to make
choices, including you.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:46.372
Why can't you just
say what you mean?

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:47.907
You first.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:48.931
All right.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.269
Not tonight.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:57.305
I'm gonna go.

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:01.476
- We're gonna talk, right?
- Yeah.

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:06.081
Not that either of us cares,
but Happy Valentine's Day.

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:10.019
You, too.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:54.329
Howdy?

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:06.541
I am so lonely.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:11.079
I'm so completely lonely.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:15.283
It's not your fault, though.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.055
Is this voicemail or...

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:26.194
If you don't say anything,
it's voicemail.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.946
So anyway how's your mom?

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.502
Oh my God.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.638
Where are you?

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:40.442
No, I'm... I'm alone.

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:43.423
And you're somewhere else,

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:48.228
but you called and I didn't
answer because I am a jerk.

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:50.218
Read me a poem.

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:54.367
No, not that one.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.625
That one's not sad enough.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:01.096
It has to be a sad one
because I am really sad.

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:06.234
And I know I can tell you
that but it's also true.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:10.672
I mean I had wine with dinner.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:16.478
I gotta go.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.422
You.

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.357
Come in. Come in.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.789
What's going on?

01:05:33.813 --> 01:05:36.364
I'm hanging out and I'm really
happy to see you.

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:38.500
You've been drinking?

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:43.505
I can't move in with you.

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:48.410
I'm terrified and alone
and I can't.

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:53.281
Maybe you should sit
down. Sit down.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:58.453
I'm going to bed though.
Will you come with me?

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:04.659
Is there any way I'm gonna get an answer about
why you ignored me all day and got drunk alone?

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.730
I was...

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.399
There was...

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:14.703
I lie and I'm a bad person.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:21.276
Why don't I escort you to bed?

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.246
Escort service.

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:39.527
Goodnight. Sleep well.

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:43.509
You're not staying?

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.367
No. Goodnight.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.476
You should stay.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.429
What are you doing?

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.600
Waiting for you, I guess.

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:25.473
I'm here.

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.244
Yeah?

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:36.129
I know we've been off
for a while now.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:37.530
You want to go inside?

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.753
I like it out here.

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:41.768
All right.

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:45.260
I want to start
by saying I've changed.

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:49.675
We've been doing this thing for a
while where it's like, I don't know,

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:54.680
neither of us want to let our guard
down and I'm... I'm past it, it's stupid.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:56.182
Let's go inside.

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:57.272
George, what the fuck?

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.380
You should never
let your guard down.

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:07.515
What do you mean?

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.490
Doesn't matter why it happened or
how it happened but I got used to...

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.359
not having you around.

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:22.241
I'm sorry, you're saying...

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:26.533
That this thing of ours,
it's not a thing to me anymore.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.537
No, please, don't.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.185
Please don't say that.

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:38.323
I'm... I've changed. I'm ready to commit,
to be a consistent person for you.

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:39.581
Since when?

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:42.761
Last week. I don't
really remember.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.752
Why didn't you tell
me last week?

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:47.555
I was busy.

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:51.237
There's nothing I can do.

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:53.305
You're being really
final about this.

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.608
- It's how I feel.
- You're not doing this.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.542
I am.

01:08:56.566 --> 01:09:00.345
So you're telling me that it has
nothing to do with anything I did

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.247
and at some point you just
decided you were done?

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:04.484
- So you're saying...
- Like I said, the details don't matter.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:06.774
- They do. They do matter though, George.
- Why?

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:12.514
Please. Please don't do this.
I can move in, we can...

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:15.294
We can get married,
it could be here.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.662
This is the right thing.
This is what I'm doing.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:19.520
Nothing means anything anymore.

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:23.892
- Wait.
- What?

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.662
Say what you want to say,
I'm listening.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:29.841
I'm here.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:31.644
I'm listening to you.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.635
So you can
say whatever you want.

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:29.692
Can I help you?

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.861
No, that's okay. Thank you.

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:40.535
Jesus.

01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:31.584
<i>Hello, you've reached
Anton's voicemail.</i>

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:35.877
<i>I'm currently traveling, so I probably
won't hear any message you leave.</i>

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:43.051
Hello.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:48.801
I told you not to smoke and I
told you not to eat ice cream.

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:51.369
I remember.

01:13:51.393 --> 01:13:53.939
Something I've learned though is that
even though those things are dangerous,

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:56.731
there's nothing more dangerous
than falling in love.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.427
What?

01:13:59.451 --> 01:14:01.611
Never fall in love and never
try to do the right thing.

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:02.815
I have to go.

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:04.639
Remember what I said.
