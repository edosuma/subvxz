00:38.481 --> 00:40.817
What are you doing here?

00:42.820 --> 00:45.115
It's funny...

00:45.155 --> 00:48.450
I've passed this place
a thousand times, and...

00:48.491 --> 00:53.164
I never gave a second thought
as to who might live here.

00:56.417 --> 00:58.420
Why would you?

01:01.088 --> 01:04.465
- I'm not what you think I am.
- Hm.

01:04.507 --> 01:07.469
And, uh...

01:07.510 --> 01:10.597
what is it that you think
I think you are?

01:18.897 --> 01:22.152
I wonder if he can see us
right now.

01:22.192 --> 01:25.447
He sees what he chooses to.

01:53.808 --> 01:55.435
Did you know

01:55.477 --> 01:58.480
that the wettest place
on earth...

02:00.481 --> 02:05.278
...is a small
garden island...

02:07.280 --> 02:09.282
...in Hawaii?

02:17.664 --> 02:20.168
Hey, hey, Robbie, man,
check it out.

03:47.879 --> 03:51.092
No. Please, please,
I didn't mean to...

03:51.133 --> 03:58.014
I didn't meant to say...
No, no. No, no, please. No.

03:58.056 --> 04:02.061
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to...

04:02.103 --> 04:03.895
Wake up.

04:03.937 --> 04:06.231
OK.

04:06.274 --> 04:08.401
Look.

04:08.443 --> 04:10.944
My book.

04:14.616 --> 04:17.660
- I saw... I saw you.
- She said she was over it.

04:17.701 --> 04:19.745
Maybe we should
call her parents.

04:19.786 --> 04:21.872
No! Her parents being
her parents--that's why

04:21.913 --> 04:24.083
- she's staying with us.
- Hehe... I didn't think

04:24.125 --> 04:27.086
it was real. I didn't want...
No, it wasn't real,

04:27.127 --> 04:29.004
it wasn't real...

04:29.045 --> 04:30.964
Are you...

04:33.468 --> 04:35.427
Are you a werewolf?

04:35.470 --> 04:37.430
- Oh, OK, you know what--
- No, Alyssa!

04:37.471 --> 04:39.432
- What?
- If you wake up a person

04:39.473 --> 04:41.434
that's dreaming that they're
dying, they actually die.

04:41.475 --> 04:43.603
- No, they don't.
- Alyssa, they do.

04:43.644 --> 04:46.564
- Alexa, where did you get that from?
- I saw it on the internet.

04:46.605 --> 04:49.774
No!

04:49.817 --> 04:52.444
Dad!

04:52.487 --> 04:55.490
It's OK. Shh, shh.
It's OK.

05:18.346 --> 05:21.598
: <i>Black fur,</i>
<i>yellow eyes,</i>

05:21.641 --> 05:24.060
five to six feet in height,

05:24.100 --> 05:27.230
torso roughly the size
of a smallish pony.

05:27.271 --> 05:29.732
Francis, can I ask
your proximity to the animal?

05:29.773 --> 05:32.067
Twenty paces.

05:32.108 --> 05:35.071
You were in open ground?

05:35.112 --> 05:38.908
Trees. I ran for the trees.

05:38.949 --> 05:41.451
The tree line is triple
that distance.

05:43.454 --> 05:47.584
Well, forgive my fucking
depth perception.

05:47.625 --> 05:50.252
In moonlight.

05:52.295 --> 05:54.923
Francis, were you
under the influence of alcohol

05:54.964 --> 05:57.593
or any narcotics that night?

05:57.634 --> 06:00.680
I saw what I saw.

06:00.721 --> 06:03.725
The doctor is just trying to
get all of the facts, Francis.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.101
Today I have

06:06.142 --> 06:08.853
seen the dragon.

06:08.896 --> 06:11.232
- Don't touch him.
- It's OK.

06:11.274 --> 06:13.233
You.

06:15.278 --> 06:19.365
It was you.

06:19.406 --> 06:21.824
I don't want to see that.

06:21.867 --> 06:23.826
I don't want to see that!

06:23.869 --> 06:26.122
I'd like to believe you,

06:26.163 --> 06:29.709
but given the physical...

06:29.750 --> 06:32.877
improbability of what it is
you saw, is there anything

06:32.920 --> 06:34.879
you could tell us that could
not have been fabricated

06:34.922 --> 06:37.173
from any number
of newspaper or TV reports?

06:37.216 --> 06:41.802
You come from a place where
it was OK to call a man a liar?

06:44.766 --> 06:47.392
You were in the 24th infantry?

06:47.435 --> 06:49.060
Yeah.

06:49.103 --> 06:50.771
I was in the 16th.

06:50.812 --> 06:54.190
Ramadi.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.485
You didn't ask to see
what you've seen.

06:56.526 --> 06:59.447
But people who've been to places
that we've been to,

06:59.488 --> 07:02.115
we see things
in a different way.

07:02.158 --> 07:05.119
And if there is a single bit
of forensic evidence

07:05.161 --> 07:06.620
that you can remember...

07:11.625 --> 07:13.670
...it would go a long way
in making sure

07:13.711 --> 07:16.713
this doesn't happen
again, Francis.

07:21.427 --> 07:22.970
Snatch.

07:31.437 --> 07:34.898
The demon dog went
for her lady part first.

07:50.163 --> 07:52.124
Your wings...

07:52.165 --> 07:54.125
are wet.

07:54.168 --> 07:57.379
Excuse me?

08:21.737 --> 08:23.697
Hospital coffee.

08:23.740 --> 08:27.367
The miracles of modern medicine
still can't pour water over beans.

08:27.410 --> 08:29.829
Well, it's the grind,
not the pour.

08:29.870 --> 08:34.082
So, what do you make
of our demon dog?

08:39.087 --> 08:42.216
I would say there's
no question Mr. Pullman suffers

08:42.258 --> 08:44.217
from typical
dissociative symptoms

08:44.259 --> 08:46.596
associated with severe
psychological trauma.

08:46.636 --> 08:49.347
He was right about the murder.

08:49.389 --> 08:51.768
The animal did go snatch-first.

08:51.808 --> 08:55.104
Well, I didn't say
I thought he was wrong.

08:55.144 --> 08:58.524
He's seen other things
that are...

08:58.566 --> 09:00.484
corroborated.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.241
Francis.

09:10.244 --> 09:12.705
Well, I won't take up
any more of your time.

09:14.706 --> 09:17.876
But if you were me...

09:17.918 --> 09:20.879
what would you do next?

09:20.922 --> 09:25.467
The creature he described didn't seem
especially probable to me either.

09:25.509 --> 09:27.470
I would go

09:27.510 --> 09:30.722
to the most likely place
it would have come from--

09:30.764 --> 09:32.975
if he really saw what he saw.

09:33.015 --> 09:36.645
The town's other
medical facility.

09:36.687 --> 09:38.898
The conspicuously phallic one.

09:38.940 --> 09:41.650
The White Tower.

09:41.692 --> 09:43.985
Wouldn't be the first
improbable thing

09:44.027 --> 09:45.988
to come out of there.

09:46.028 --> 09:48.990
Oh, I'd encourage you
not to make an appointment.

09:49.032 --> 09:51.284
If I'm not mistaken,

09:51.326 --> 09:53.788
your name is on the side
of the building.

09:53.830 --> 09:56.206
Or mention my name.

10:02.922 --> 10:05.924
Oh, and ask to speak
to Dr. Johann Pryce.

10:13.682 --> 10:15.267
Good morning,

10:15.308 --> 10:17.352
sister!

10:17.394 --> 10:19.813
Morning, darling.

10:33.284 --> 10:36.831
There was a time when the breakfast table
was a place for civilized conversation.

10:36.873 --> 10:39.166
I have some business to attend.

10:39.207 --> 10:41.668
You need to give your sister
a ride.

10:41.711 --> 10:43.586
Uh, I have plans after school.

10:43.629 --> 10:45.087
Indeed.

10:45.129 --> 10:47.841
Giving your sister a ride.

10:50.052 --> 10:52.804
Your visitor last night.
It seemed the two of you had

10:52.846 --> 10:55.015
- rather a lot to talk about.
- Oh, yeah.

10:55.057 --> 10:58.644
We're building a diorama
of the solar system.

10:58.686 --> 11:00.730
Mercury, Mars...

11:00.770 --> 11:02.648
Uranus.

11:04.524 --> 11:08.445
Don't encourage him.

11:08.486 --> 11:10.364
Strange.

11:10.405 --> 11:13.783
He told me he was here
to finish an English assignment.

11:13.826 --> 11:15.785
Yep.

11:15.827 --> 11:17.705
That's what I said.

11:17.746 --> 11:20.249
What was his business here?

11:20.289 --> 11:22.250
OK.

11:22.292 --> 11:25.587
You win, Mom. I've been waiting
for the right time

11:25.629 --> 11:28.758
to tell you, but without all the
fiery passion of your disapproval.

11:28.798 --> 11:33.386
We take turns playing Juliet. I hope the
headboard didn't make too much noise.

11:35.389 --> 11:38.517
what you track into this house

11:38.558 --> 11:41.311
you will scrub from the floor.

11:41.352 --> 11:45.691
Have you ever made a threat so cryptic
you yourself don't understand it?

11:45.732 --> 11:49.110
I will not have that filth in my house!

11:51.822 --> 11:54.157
All right, I'm going to school.

11:54.198 --> 11:56.201
Can I pick up some new batteries
for your vibrator?

11:56.243 --> 11:59.120
I hope you're proud

11:59.162 --> 12:01.498
of your foulness
at your own mother.

12:04.418 --> 12:07.046
Imagine that whatever comes
out of my mouth next is

12:07.087 --> 12:10.215
exactly what you want to hear.
All right?

12:10.256 --> 12:12.009
Come on, Shel.

12:15.553 --> 12:18.099
Have a good day at school,
darling.

12:20.392 --> 12:24.395
<i>I am dismayed to report
this is not the only evidence</i>

12:24.437 --> 12:27.107
<i>of a general decline</i>
<i>in mother's temper lately.</i>

12:29.149 --> 12:31.988
<i>Roman and I made a quick stop</i>
<i>en route to school,</i>

12:32.028 --> 12:34.615
<i>and who should we encounter</i>
<i>but Jenny from the club.</i>

12:34.657 --> 12:36.575
<i>To my surprise,</i>

12:36.616 --> 12:39.452
<i>she was ringing up a sale</i>
<i>at the jewelry counter.</i>

12:39.495 --> 12:44.249
<i>But Jenny looked at me with</i>
<i>a distinct lack of enthusiasm</i>

12:44.291 --> 12:46.418
<i>and only the barest nod</i>
<i>of recognition.</i>

12:48.419 --> 12:51.340
<i>Of course I was crushed</i>

12:51.380 --> 12:55.302
<i>and wracked my brains for any</i>
<i>offense I may have caused her.</i>

12:55.344 --> 12:59.097
<i>My first assumption, as always,</i>
<i>is that it was my own fault.</i>

13:01.224 --> 13:03.393
Missed you at the club
the other night.

13:03.434 --> 13:07.730
Well, your psycho mother got
me fired.

13:07.773 --> 13:10.817
She's a farm-fresh cunt.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.861
You're bad.

13:18.658 --> 13:20.827
<i>I was horrified,</i>

13:20.870 --> 13:22.538
<i>both at mother's rashness</i>

13:22.578 --> 13:25.248
<i>and Roman.</i>
<i>Within our walls is one thing,</i>

13:25.289 --> 13:27.668
<i>but to talk so</i>
<i>in a public setting...</i>

13:27.710 --> 13:31.047
Do you know what would look
fabulous on you?

13:31.087 --> 13:33.506
<i>But then she turned</i>
<i>to me and smiled,</i>

13:33.548 --> 13:37.177
<i>and my dejection was immediately</i>
<i>an un-mourned memory.</i>

13:37.217 --> 13:39.763
So elegant.

13:39.804 --> 13:42.892
Just waiting
for the perfect lady.

13:45.268 --> 13:47.145
Come here.

13:47.187 --> 13:50.399
<i>Astonishing how</i>
<i>much of the world's troubles can</i>

13:50.440 --> 13:52.692
<i>be erased by the simplest smile</i>

13:52.735 --> 13:56.072
<i>and the feeling of something</i>
<i>precious against one's cheek.</i>

13:59.158 --> 14:02.745
Ah,<i>jolie fille!</i> What do
you think, big brother?

14:02.785 --> 14:08.083
I think my sister deserves
a diamond as big as the Ritz.

14:10.418 --> 14:12.629
But Mom would shit
a bowling ball.

14:12.671 --> 14:16.383
Don't tell me you're becoming
the responsible one.

14:16.424 --> 14:18.760
Who told you anything about us?

14:21.513 --> 14:23.993
<i>But of course Roman</i>
<i>was right about how mother would</i>

14:24.015 --> 14:28.269
<i>receive this gesture,</i>
<i>and even he picks his battles.</i>

14:28.311 --> 14:31.606
<i>There's a dread to even</i>
<i>the calms of this family lately,</i>

14:31.648 --> 14:34.275
<i>and I cannot escape the feeling</i>

14:34.317 --> 14:37.071
<i>if things continue</i>
<i>on this course, it is building</i>

14:37.113 --> 14:42.576
<i>to some fearful and mysterious</i>
<i>and irreparable end.</i>

14:51.168 --> 14:54.004
<i>Car 2, respond to the corner</i>
<i>of Oslo and 5th.</i>

14:54.046 --> 14:55.504
<i>Female caller is on scene.</i>

14:55.547 --> 14:58.801
<i>Report of suspicious behavior</i>
<i>in the alley</i>

14:58.841 --> 15:00.427
<i>behind the mini-mart.</i>

15:00.469 --> 15:03.388
<i>Car 2, we're two blocks north</i>
<i>of that location.</i>

15:03.429 --> 15:05.890
<i>We'll turn up the alley</i>
<i>and see what we can see.</i>

15:05.932 --> 15:09.727
<i>Dispatch, this is Sworn.</i>
<i>I'm about a hundred yards south</i>

15:09.769 --> 15:13.190
<i>of Mile Marker 4 on the county</i>
<i>fire access road. Hikers found</i>

15:13.231 --> 15:16.735
<i>what looks like wolf droppings. Need
a car bring out some evidence bags.</i>

15:16.777 --> 15:20.072
- <i>You never know.</i>
<i>- This is Dispatch. Right away, Sheriff.</i>

15:39.466 --> 15:41.426
When was it discovered?

15:41.467 --> 15:43.427
About an hour ago.
What are you doing here?

15:43.470 --> 15:45.471
I'm not here for your coffee
and pie.

15:47.807 --> 15:49.268
How long you think

15:49.309 --> 15:51.644
- it's been there?
- A week or so.

15:51.687 --> 15:54.480
Quite conceivably left the night
of the killing.

15:54.523 --> 15:57.985
Do you think it's... relevant?

15:58.027 --> 16:00.028
One way to find out.

16:01.989 --> 16:04.783
I'm too old for this.

16:04.825 --> 16:07.285
No bone matter,
undigested fabric...

16:09.412 --> 16:12.207
But what do we have here?

16:16.503 --> 16:20.548
- Is that animal?
- You a betting man?

16:20.590 --> 16:23.552
Could run it up
to Godfrey's mausoleum

16:23.592 --> 16:25.888
and get Dr. Pryce's people
to take a look.

16:25.928 --> 16:28.597
Hm. Enough tongues wagging
as it is.

16:32.144 --> 16:34.104
Mind if I take a look?

16:37.774 --> 16:39.275
Wow.

16:43.613 --> 16:47.743
Guess you never know what might
come up, huh?

16:47.783 --> 16:49.745
That's quite the setup--

16:49.785 --> 16:51.788
fish and game-wise.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.581
Mm.

16:53.623 --> 16:56.168
Lucky for me, I guess, we send

16:56.210 --> 16:58.294
our forensic evidence
out to Pittsburgh.

17:00.297 --> 17:02.631
They got a... lab there.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.675
Solid.

17:05.719 --> 17:08.346
Top... drawer.

17:08.387 --> 17:11.432
You got anything?

17:11.473 --> 17:13.434
Well, I can't tell much
from the hair

17:13.476 --> 17:16.188
since it's partially digested
so the root isn't present.

17:16.230 --> 17:19.232
I need the root
for an in-depth analysis.

17:19.275 --> 17:21.192
We'll send it out,
see what they can find.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.194
Not your first rodeo, huh?

17:23.237 --> 17:27.281
Jack of all trades--
master of none.

17:29.285 --> 17:31.661
But you... can't find
anything?

17:31.702 --> 17:36.665
Well, it's certainly human.
Uh, probably female.

17:36.708 --> 17:40.545
- You can tell the sex?
- Just assumption. It's, uh,

17:40.586 --> 17:42.838
six inches long.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.343
Right.

17:48.345 --> 17:51.640
- Sheriff?
- Yeah?

17:51.681 --> 17:54.683
Can I interest you
in a glass of rye?

20:30.632 --> 20:33.926
Psh. Forty years
of Gloria Steinem

20:33.969 --> 20:37.556
so that some anorexic can
teach girls that it's all about

20:37.597 --> 20:40.976
losing weight
and pleasing men. Jeez.

20:41.017 --> 20:44.145
I mean, if we don't make it
easier on ourselves, who will?

20:47.106 --> 20:49.609
It doesn't have to be this hard.

20:51.944 --> 20:54.490
It doesn't cost anything
to ask.

20:56.825 --> 21:00.953
I think purple with a purpose
is not your color.

21:06.626 --> 21:09.337
OK. It's on, bitch.

21:20.641 --> 21:22.267
Hey. Where you going?

21:22.308 --> 21:24.269
Hey. Bus.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.438
Godfreys don't ride buses.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.730
Aren't you the gallant one.

21:28.772 --> 21:31.692
All right, he's got two.
Now let's try three.

21:31.733 --> 21:34.737
All right. Oh, and he's doing
three at a time! Oh, no, no!

21:34.778 --> 21:38.074
- He doesn't do it! He doesn't do it.
- Terrible.

21:38.115 --> 21:39.576
Got any other tricks?

21:39.617 --> 21:41.662
Not with the ladies present.

21:41.702 --> 21:43.704
Have you met my cousin Letha?

21:43.746 --> 21:45.080
No.

21:45.123 --> 21:46.749
Peter.

21:46.790 --> 21:48.960
Hey.

21:52.297 --> 21:55.592
If the circus is
over, let's get going.

21:57.594 --> 21:59.346
Come on, Shel.

22:19.781 --> 22:21.242
What?

22:21.284 --> 22:22.785
Nothing.

22:25.038 --> 22:28.416
Remember that guy lying in the
road the night of the dance?

22:28.458 --> 22:30.586
The one who saw Brooke Bluebell?

22:30.626 --> 22:32.712
Yeah.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.506
Ouroboros.

22:34.548 --> 22:36.883
I seen that cheerleader.
I saw her get killed.

22:36.924 --> 22:39.260
Today I've seen the Dragon.

22:39.301 --> 22:41.846
I was thinking maybe you could
talk to your pops,

22:41.887 --> 22:44.015
see if you can find out more
about him.

22:44.057 --> 22:46.142
Like what?

22:46.183 --> 22:50.521
Like, um, something that might
not have made the papers.

22:50.564 --> 22:53.773
What are you two up to?

22:53.816 --> 22:55.776
That's on a need-to-know
basis.

22:55.817 --> 22:58.153
- Hunting the demon dog.
- No, you're not.

23:00.155 --> 23:02.157
There are mitigating
circumstances.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.202
We think the demon dog might
actually be a person.

23:05.244 --> 23:06.787
Are you high?

23:06.828 --> 23:08.749
Beside the point.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.250
- This guy is hurting people.
- OK.

23:11.292 --> 23:14.211
- A, it's not a guy. It's an it.
- Shh.

23:14.253 --> 23:17.758
B, say you had a single good
reason to think it was a person,

23:17.798 --> 23:22.010
you can't seriously think you're better off
chasing him than a trained professional.

23:22.053 --> 23:24.012
And C,

23:24.055 --> 23:27.308
what do you think a psychiatric
patient's gonna be able to tell you?

23:27.349 --> 23:28.808
Is that a yes?

23:28.851 --> 23:30.810
Say it was a person.

23:30.853 --> 23:33.230
What do you imagine you're gonna
do when you find him?

23:33.272 --> 23:36.984
What do you think, sweetheart?
Put him in the pound.

23:43.282 --> 23:46.787
Can I ask what possible good you
think is gonna come from this?

23:48.788 --> 23:50.289
No.

24:10.934 --> 24:15.064
Hey. Why did you say
demon dog?

24:15.105 --> 24:19.234
It calls less attention to seem like you're
a retard than you're hiding something.

24:19.277 --> 24:23.405
People paying attention to me isn't the
same as people paying attention to you.

24:23.448 --> 24:25.907
All right.
Meet you at midnight.

24:25.950 --> 24:28.118
You bring the shovels,
I'll bring the rest.

24:51.267 --> 24:54.855
Jesus, Nicolai. Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

24:57.105 --> 24:58.567
Hey.

24:58.607 --> 25:01.819
How are ya?
How was your day?

25:01.862 --> 25:03.821
Weird day,

25:03.864 --> 25:07.325
month, whatever. Yours?

25:07.366 --> 25:12.329
Oh, it was OK. I, uh, I ran into your
friend's mom at the general store.

25:12.372 --> 25:15.083
Well, you know what they say

25:15.124 --> 25:16.585
about small towns.

25:16.625 --> 25:19.546
Yeah. Yeah, I think
she was looking for me.

25:19.587 --> 25:21.839
Yeah?

25:21.882 --> 25:25.676
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

25:25.719 --> 25:29.221
The woman was trying to act sly, but
you could smell the desperation.

25:29.263 --> 25:32.267
I mean, she must've gone through
the last of what Vince sold her.

25:32.307 --> 25:35.353
You know? But she can't
bring herself to ask

25:35.394 --> 25:38.647
someone like me for more.

25:38.690 --> 25:41.859
- She wants my stuff.
- I suppose you could just give it to her.

25:41.902 --> 25:44.112
What would be the fun in that?

25:47.115 --> 25:49.075
I got duck.

25:49.116 --> 25:52.746
I thought I would make something
fancy schmancy tonight.

25:52.788 --> 25:55.080
Ah, I'm going out.

25:55.123 --> 25:57.291
I know.

26:03.757 --> 26:07.093
You know, your grandfather
Nicolai was very proud of you.

26:07.134 --> 26:09.887
You know that?

26:09.930 --> 26:13.432
Do you remember
when that picture was taken?

26:16.269 --> 26:17.938
No, I can't.

26:23.943 --> 26:25.945
- See you later.
- I love you.

26:33.076 --> 26:35.747
Have you been sleeping?

26:35.788 --> 26:38.750
- Why do you ask?
- You look...

26:38.791 --> 26:43.253
I would think very carefully how you
choose to finish that sentence.

26:43.296 --> 26:45.423
How's Norman holding up?

26:47.592 --> 26:51.846
What a remarkable imitation of empathy!
Have we been practicing?

26:51.887 --> 26:55.599
I bear him no ill will, and
the hatred he feels for me has

26:55.642 --> 26:57.853
the whiff of something stale
and self-annihilating.

26:57.894 --> 27:00.438
As a far-superior thinker
to myself once wrote,

27:00.480 --> 27:03.191
men cling to their hates
because they fear

27:03.231 --> 27:06.862
once their hates are gone, they'll
have to deal with their own self-pain.

27:09.196 --> 27:12.867
And the men dig,
gouge each other

27:12.909 --> 27:15.369
because you both imagine
one will strike oil

27:15.411 --> 27:17.705
while the other drowns
in his own blood.

27:17.747 --> 27:22.292
At any rate, have you had the opportunity
to speak with him about our friends at Lod?

27:22.335 --> 27:24.503
They're prepared to make a bid
for his shares.

27:24.546 --> 27:26.798
That's generous,
even by Godfrey standards.

27:26.839 --> 27:29.800
It's not the right time.

27:29.843 --> 27:33.261
They're getting...
rather insistent.

27:33.304 --> 27:34.847
More than I am?

27:43.063 --> 27:46.401
Hello, glowworm.
I sincerely

27:46.442 --> 27:49.278
apologize for any discomfort.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.699
Are you still feeling pain here?

27:52.740 --> 27:54.951
Just as long as we're
on the subject,

27:54.992 --> 27:57.578
we need to discuss the matter
of my niece's pregnancy.

27:57.619 --> 28:00.039
Certainly.

28:00.079 --> 28:03.417
She will require
the best treatment.

28:03.459 --> 28:06.046
Only the best for family.

28:06.086 --> 28:08.048
That's it.
Follow the light.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.465
Did you have a place in mind?

28:13.803 --> 28:16.471
You do realize we do not have
an obstetrics wing here.

28:16.513 --> 28:18.599
You do now.

28:18.641 --> 28:21.143
I expect you'll have
a contractor

28:21.184 --> 28:23.144
by the end of the weekend.

28:23.186 --> 28:26.982
Whoever the top-flight minds are
in the field, offer them...

28:27.025 --> 28:29.151
whatever you need to.

28:29.192 --> 28:34.531
Consider any budgetary requirements
for this project pre-approved.

28:34.574 --> 28:37.242
Norman...

28:37.285 --> 28:39.244
will never agree.

28:39.287 --> 28:42.539
Norman will agree
to what's best.

28:44.541 --> 28:46.544
For Letha.

28:50.381 --> 28:53.425
I'll start reviewing
candidates immediately.

29:00.223 --> 29:02.935
I, um...

29:02.978 --> 29:04.561
I need some fresh air.

29:04.604 --> 29:08.691
Uh, I'll be right outside,
darling.

29:17.866 --> 29:19.827
Would you like to see
something, glowworm?

29:28.461 --> 29:30.712
<i>Beautiful.</i>

29:30.755 --> 29:34.592
And like so many
beautiful things, deceiving.

29:34.634 --> 29:38.512
It grows, feeds, breathes,
and is not a living thing--

29:38.554 --> 29:39.888
technically speaking.

29:39.931 --> 29:43.143
Consider it a... preview.

29:43.183 --> 29:47.521
A promise of more to come.

29:47.563 --> 29:49.731
A gift.

29:49.773 --> 29:52.693
<i>Please,</i>
<i>a hand.</i>

29:52.734 --> 29:54.403
Soon.

30:03.872 --> 30:07.458
They don't carry rye here.
Is bourbon OK?

30:07.500 --> 30:11.837
- Don't know I could tell the difference.
- Hm. Birds fly and pigs don't.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.425
Excuse me, hon.

30:17.468 --> 30:19.595
When you get a chance.

30:19.636 --> 30:22.807
Sheriff, if you don't mind me asking, are
you familiar with funerary practices?

30:22.848 --> 30:26.309
Ashes to ashes, like that?

30:26.352 --> 30:29.396
- Mm. Another hobby of mine.
- You ever consider stamps?

30:29.438 --> 30:31.648
The history's quite
fascinating, actually.

30:31.691 --> 30:34.068
For instance, did you know
the ancient Egyptians were

30:34.109 --> 30:36.820
the first to develop the process
of embalming?

30:36.863 --> 30:41.116
Preserving the flesh of their deceased so
they could be welcomed by their god Osiris.

30:43.326 --> 30:45.453
Greeks, on the other hand,

30:45.496 --> 30:49.458
they anointed their dead
with perfumes and spices.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.669
For them, it was all
about the send-off.

30:51.711 --> 30:54.923
Well, you only go once,
I guess, huh?

30:54.963 --> 30:56.924
Really?

30:56.965 --> 30:58.968
Topic for another time.

31:01.386 --> 31:04.766
Of course, Western culture's
developed its own burial rituals.

31:04.807 --> 31:08.769
Like so much of modern life,
it's a hodgepodge of capitalism,

31:08.810 --> 31:11.480
religion, health code,
and statues.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.982
I don't mean
to be rude, Doctor.

31:14.025 --> 31:17.444
You as much as asked Peter
Rumancek if he was a werewolf.

31:17.486 --> 31:19.962
I don't suppose you are by
any chance a werewolf, Peter.

31:20.369 --> 31:21.490
I beg your pardon?

31:21.609 --> 31:24.492
When the moon is full, do you
walk in the skin of a wolf?

31:24.535 --> 31:28.455
No, sir.

31:28.497 --> 31:32.126
- Ma'am.<i>- And I stood there like</i>
<i>it was the most sensible thing</i>

31:32.167 --> 31:34.545
I'd ever heard,
which it sure as hell wasn't.

31:34.586 --> 31:37.548
Today, you show up uninvited
to poke through a pile of crap

31:37.589 --> 31:40.550
and then invite me down here for a
drink so you can explain undertaking.

31:40.593 --> 31:42.553
If this is some kind of joke,
it's not funny.

31:42.595 --> 31:45.973
The Willoughby girl's autopsy.
They fucked it up.

31:46.015 --> 31:47.557
What?

31:47.599 --> 31:49.602
They didn't collect
any usable hair samples.

31:52.855 --> 31:56.192
I don't recall anyone
releasing the autopsy results.

31:58.193 --> 32:01.071
Have a drink, Sheriff.

32:01.114 --> 32:05.576
One way or the other,
we're gonna need that sample.

32:05.617 --> 32:08.578
- She's in the ground, Doctor.
- Yes.

32:08.621 --> 32:11.915
And exhumation requires
a court order, parental consent.

32:11.958 --> 32:15.586
I doubt a convincing case could be
made for either, and regardless,

32:15.627 --> 32:17.630
time's a-wastin'.

32:28.098 --> 32:30.143
No!

32:32.644 --> 32:35.772
Stop. Stop.

32:35.815 --> 32:38.942
No, no, no.

32:38.984 --> 32:40.653
No!

32:45.991 --> 32:49.411
<i>So, is it weird being</i>
<i>out in the world again?</i>

32:52.498 --> 32:54.458
I'm highly medicated.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.045
Did they give you like
a million awesome tranquilizers?

32:57.086 --> 33:00.548
Topamax
for post-traumatic stress,

33:00.588 --> 33:02.549
Trazodone for insomnia,

33:02.590 --> 33:04.551
and Lexapro.

33:04.593 --> 33:06.054
Oh, lucky!

33:06.095 --> 33:09.807
I thought Lexapro was
for depression.

33:09.848 --> 33:11.851
Anxiety.

33:11.893 --> 33:15.063
Well... we could fix that.

33:20.608 --> 33:22.278
Refreshments.

33:22.319 --> 33:25.614
- Entertainment.

<i>I thought... someone had...</i>

34:47.655 --> 34:51.199
put it there for some
little girl like me to find,

34:51.242 --> 34:53.494
and I thought
they were filming it.

34:58.833 --> 35:01.210
So I thought it would be funny.

35:07.757 --> 35:10.844
You thought
what would be funny?

35:17.476 --> 35:19.603
I kissed her.

35:46.463 --> 35:49.632
Dizygotic twinning.

35:49.675 --> 35:52.927
Two eggs, two sperm.

35:52.969 --> 35:54.804
Twins run in my family.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.601
They were cheek to jaw
at the embryonic stage.

35:59.643 --> 36:03.481
The sad thing is they'll never be that
close to another human being again.

36:07.608 --> 36:09.777
What the hell is going on
in this town?

36:24.960 --> 36:28.088
Let's do this before I think
better of it.

36:38.139 --> 36:39.807
Whew.

37:01.371 --> 37:03.831
Did you actually dress up
as a grave robber?

37:03.873 --> 37:06.668
No. I dressed up
like you.

37:09.255 --> 37:13.050
Did you know that people used to believe the
dead came back as bloodthirsty revenants

37:13.092 --> 37:15.719
because the bloating
of internal organs made them,

37:15.760 --> 37:19.014
like... like, belch up fluid
from inside the lungs.

37:19.056 --> 37:22.393
Huh.

37:22.434 --> 37:25.480
They're coming
to get you, Barbara.

37:25.521 --> 37:27.856
They're coming
for you, Barbara!

37:29.608 --> 37:31.943
Is there like a summer school
for serial killers?

37:39.117 --> 37:41.869
- Shee-it.
- Shee-it.

37:44.414 --> 37:48.628
How many funerals
have you been to?

37:48.668 --> 37:51.422
A few. Rumanceks are
reliably kicking it

37:51.463 --> 37:53.632
as a result of positive
lifestyle choices.

37:55.635 --> 37:58.262
What are they like for...
for you people?

37:58.304 --> 38:01.181
- Funerals, I mean.
- Committed.

38:01.222 --> 38:04.101
<i>You're not allowed</i>
<i>to eat or wash,</i>

38:04.143 --> 38:07.771
<i>mirrors are covered, and</i>
<i>the dead guy's stuff is burnt.</i>

38:07.813 --> 38:09.315
<i>Why?</i>

38:09.356 --> 38:11.775
Because a Rumancek should not
be remembered

38:11.817 --> 38:13.568
for his worldly things.

38:15.570 --> 38:17.947
They also cut off their head.

38:17.989 --> 38:20.701
What?

38:20.742 --> 38:24.329
Things happen to our kind after
death if you don't do the head.

38:26.331 --> 38:29.710
- What kind of things?
- The bad kind.

38:34.590 --> 38:37.009
I've been to two funerals.

38:37.050 --> 38:39.219
One was my dad's.

38:39.260 --> 38:44.141
It's all pieces. I remember hearing
the shot and going downstairs.

38:44.182 --> 38:47.561
<i>He was on the floor.</i>

38:47.603 --> 38:50.606
<i>I remember thinking how much</i>
<i>trouble he'd be in for the mess.</i>

38:53.275 --> 38:54.775
That's fucked up.

38:56.777 --> 38:58.447
Dig.

40:44.637 --> 40:46.806
Where is she?

40:48.931 --> 40:50.934
Hold on.

40:58.192 --> 40:59.860
Oh, fuck me.

41:05.449 --> 41:07.784
Get the thing from my bag.

41:36.771 --> 41:39.106
Well, you want this dance?

41:39.148 --> 41:41.150
You're the expert.

41:43.820 --> 41:45.822
Here, grab the light.

42:02.715 --> 42:04.965
You don't deserve this.

42:13.851 --> 42:15.853
You make this look easy.

42:35.496 --> 42:37.958
What's your cousin gonna do
with that?

42:37.998 --> 42:40.835
What she can.
No promises.

42:49.344 --> 42:51.304
The other funeral...

42:51.346 --> 42:53.474
Yeah?

42:53.514 --> 42:55.809
It was Shelley's.

43:14.661 --> 43:17.371
Someone's here, someone's here,
someone's here, someone's here.

43:27.215 --> 43:29.217
Damn it.

43:35.056 --> 43:36.516
Come on.

43:45.818 --> 43:48.612
St. Jude.

43:48.653 --> 43:52.157
The patron saint
of hopeless causes?

43:52.199 --> 43:57.411
I--oh--don't suppose you
have an extra one.

44:04.711 --> 44:08.715
- You got people here, Sheriff?
- No, not me.

44:08.757 --> 44:11.300
I don't want a hole
when I go. Just roast me

44:11.342 --> 44:13.302
and drizzle the leavings
over the rose bushes.

44:13.344 --> 44:15.304
You're not much for ceremony,
I take it.

44:15.347 --> 44:17.932
Ah, I haven't been to a play
in years.

44:20.936 --> 44:22.730
Do you see that?

44:25.106 --> 44:26.608
Yep.

44:35.115 --> 44:37.117
What the hell?

44:39.538 --> 44:43.583
- Sheriff!
- Whoa! Ah! Ugh!

44:43.625 --> 44:46.168
Jesus Christ.

44:52.384 --> 44:54.344
Looks like someone

44:54.385 --> 44:57.264
beat us to it.

44:59.891 --> 45:02.226
May the sacred heart of Jesus...

45:02.268 --> 45:04.813
be adored,

45:04.855 --> 45:07.983
preserved, glorified, and loved
throughout the world

45:08.025 --> 45:11.193
now and forever.

45:11.235 --> 45:13.195
Amen.

45:13.237 --> 45:15.824
What the fuck are you doing?

45:18.994 --> 45:20.954
You can call it in.

45:20.996 --> 45:23.121
We got what we came for.

45:42.601 --> 45:47.396
: <i>I have</i>
<i>an uneasy feeling, Uncle.</i>

45:50.016 --> 45:51.766
: <i>What is it?</i>

45:51.887 --> 45:54.702
<i>Christina was</i>
<i>absent from school yesterday.</i>

45:54.822 --> 45:57.615
<i>Poor innocent.</i>
<i>I cannot imagine what toll</i>

45:57.657 --> 46:00.494
<i>the demon dog's handiwork must</i>
<i>have taken on her.</i>

46:03.579 --> 46:06.958
<i>Have you heard</i>
<i>from her?</i>

46:07.001 --> 46:10.838
<i>I sent her a card</i>
<i>with a poem, but I shall not</i>

46:10.878 --> 46:14.340
<i>repeat it here. I mentioned</i>
<i>your name in the card,</i>

46:14.382 --> 46:17.217
<i>should she desire the audience</i>
<i>of a professional.</i>

46:17.260 --> 46:19.762
<i>I do hope you don't mind.</i>

46:21.764 --> 46:23.724
<i>Of course not.</i>

46:23.766 --> 46:26.728
: <i>I know</i>
<i>it all weighs on you, Uncle.</i>

46:26.769 --> 46:30.898
<i>The burden of it lies</i>
<i>between your words.</i>

46:30.940 --> 46:33.400
: <i>Don't worry</i>
<i>about your old uncle.</i>

46:33.443 --> 46:36.070
<i>That's the last thing you need.</i>

46:36.112 --> 46:39.074
: <i>Forgive</i>
<i>my presumptions,</i>

46:39.115 --> 46:42.452
<i>but when I'm making my own
reconciliations, I derive some consolation</i>

46:42.494 --> 46:46.039
<i>by remembering these words:</i>

46:46.081 --> 46:48.666
<i>"I cannot tell how it mounts</i>
<i>on the winds,</i>

46:48.708 --> 46:51.920
<i>"through the clouds,</i>
<i>and flies through heaven.</i>

46:51.961 --> 46:55.465
<i>Today I have seen the Dragon."</i>

47:18.612 --> 47:22.617
- Tom?
- Jesus Christ.

47:25.327 --> 47:27.329
I couldn't sleep.

47:30.458 --> 47:33.170
Yeah... you and me both.

47:35.172 --> 47:37.132
How you doin'?

47:37.173 --> 47:39.885
A little better? I know
you've been through a lot.

47:39.927 --> 47:43.597
So have you.

47:45.639 --> 47:47.851
I know that smell.

47:50.478 --> 47:52.563
Yeah, don't worry about that.

47:56.985 --> 48:00.114
- Christina, it's really l--
- You know what I was thinking?

48:00.155 --> 48:01.697
What?

48:01.739 --> 48:04.034
Well...

48:04.076 --> 48:06.369
I want a felt life,

48:06.411 --> 48:10.373
because I want to be an author.

48:10.414 --> 48:12.375
So, like,

48:12.416 --> 48:15.545
all the horrible things
that happen to me,

48:15.586 --> 48:18.882
they're OK, because they just...

48:18.923 --> 48:21.927
bring me closer
to enlightenment.

48:25.097 --> 48:28.474
Sometimes when I talk to you...

48:28.516 --> 48:32.980
I forget
who the grown-up is.

48:33.021 --> 48:35.065
I'm gonna go to bed now.

48:35.106 --> 48:37.108
All right.

49:20.777 --> 49:22.778
Peter, are you ready?

49:47.094 --> 49:49.222
OK, tell me someone brought
the bottle.

49:49.264 --> 49:51.266
Who's got the bottle?

49:51.307 --> 49:52.809
I have it here.

50:03.527 --> 50:05.403
Yeah.

50:59.041 --> 51:02.003
Ah!

51:29.447 --> 51:30.907
Sweet.

51:41.335 --> 51:42.960
Sworn.

51:43.003 --> 51:45.963
[Congratulations. It's a boy.]

51:46.005 --> 51:47.715
What do you mean?

51:47.757 --> 51:50.469
The hair sample.
Didn't come from Willoughby.

51:50.550 --> 51:52.510
Came from a human male.

51:58.184 --> 52:00.186
