WEBVTT

00:06.049 --> 00:07.442
Hey.

00:07.485 --> 00:08.791
For Emma's quinceañera,

00:08.834 --> 00:10.271
am I supposed to just get her money,

00:10.314 --> 00:11.707
or if I wanted to add something extra,

00:11.750 --> 00:14.057
would she like a NutriBullet,

00:14.101 --> 00:16.103
makeup, rosary beads,

00:16.146 --> 00:19.497
a T-shirt that says "Slay all day"?

00:19.541 --> 00:21.282
She's gonna like whatever you get her.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.457
I just want it to be good, you know?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.067
I always feel like
Emma doesn't like me.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.590
What? Why?

00:25.634 --> 00:27.853
She always goes to her room
whenever I come over.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.507
And there was the time
she saw in the towel

00:29.551 --> 00:30.682
and it was never addressed.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.207
Jonah, she's 15 years old.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.427
If you're not Ariana Grande
or Gritty, she's not into it.

00:36.471 --> 00:37.820
Yeah, but I'm, like, the guy

00:37.863 --> 00:39.778
who stole her mom away from her dad.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.693
Yeah, no, you're right. It's true.

00:41.737 --> 00:45.436
I was in a happy, fulfilling,
blissful marriage

00:45.480 --> 00:47.699
that would have just gone on
forever and ever

00:47.743 --> 00:50.311
if you hadn't swooped in
and started whispering

00:50.354 --> 00:52.226
"This American Life"
stories into my ear

00:52.269 --> 00:53.227
until my panties dropped.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.619
I'm just saying.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.187
I don't need to go if
it's gonna make things weird.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.102
I mean, between Emma and Adam...

00:59.146 --> 01:01.365
It's not going to be weird.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.541
Calm down. I want you to be there.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.501
It would be weird if you weren't there.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.545
You sure?

01:07.589 --> 01:10.461
- Yes.
- Okay. Okay.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.637
Has she ever brought
up the towel thing?

01:12.681 --> 01:14.551
Because it was tied pretty low.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.120
It's been discussed.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:30.525 --> 01:33.702
Emma, hey! Happy quinceañera.

01:33.745 --> 01:36.139
- Thanks.
- That dress is great.

01:36.183 --> 01:39.403
Somebody is ready for the red carpet.

01:39.447 --> 01:40.353
Okay.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.450
Hey, you two, could I get a photo?

01:42.493 --> 01:44.756
- Ah, oh, yeah. Sure.
- All right.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.295
Go ahead and smile.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.934
Ah, go ahead and actually
get close together.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.849
Oh, hey, Adam, how's it going, buddy?

01:50.893 --> 01:52.547
- Hi. Hey.
- All right.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.201
Emma, what don't you take
a little step forward?

01:54.244 --> 01:55.724
And, Dad, go ahead
and throw your arms around her.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.291
- Ew, he's not my Dad.
- Yeah, I'm not...

01:57.334 --> 01:59.249
- "Ew" seems strong.
- I'm the father.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.946
Yeah, I'm just the boyfriend.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.384
Oh, no, the mother's boyfriend.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.603
I'm not... I'm not her boy...

02:05.647 --> 02:07.431
You know what? You should
probably do this instead of me.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.651
- The father-daughter photo?
- Yeah, maybe.

02:10.122 --> 02:11.000
Probably should.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.697
Oh, wow, I'm gonna have
to zoom out on that one.

02:12.741 --> 02:15.396
- You're so much taller, right?
- Thank you.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.441
There he is. Yeah, I like it.
That's good.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.791
Yeah, you guys,
you're both so... so beautiful.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.794
Thank you.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.623
Oh, you guys, went all out.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.625
Yeah, it was gonna be a little smaller,

02:27.669 --> 02:31.629
but then I... I got my promotion,
and I was like, "o it up."

02:31.673 --> 02:32.848
Bo really wanted to come,

02:32.891 --> 02:34.763
but one of his suits
is at the dry cleaner's

02:34.806 --> 02:36.591
and the other one's haunted.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.854
Okay. Yeah, those things happen.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.552
Oh, and, Amy,
Jerusha had to watch Rose,

02:41.596 --> 02:44.860
but there was no way that I was
gonna miss this celebration

02:44.903 --> 02:47.645
of Emma's transition
from girlhood to womanhood

02:47.689 --> 02:50.387
with cultural roots in Mesoamerica.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.868
Thank you, Glenn. Did you
spend some time on Wikipedia?

02:52.911 --> 02:55.305
Yeah, I did. How?

02:55.349 --> 02:57.264
- Where's Emma?
- She's over there.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.309
- Oh.
- Aw.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.088
Look at her, in her dress.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.878
I wore that dress to my quinceañera.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.793
I can't believe it.

03:04.836 --> 03:07.317
Just yesterday,
she was this little baby,

03:07.361 --> 03:10.326
and now she's this grown woman.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.498
I'm so sorry.
I have a lot of feelings today.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.517
Excuse me.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.415
I don't think I've ever
seen Amy show emotion before.

03:18.465 --> 03:19.724
I know, it's so weird.

03:19.725 --> 03:22.419
It's like, I once saw
my dentist yell at a stripper,

03:22.463 --> 03:26.336
and it was like,
"Oh, you do have feelings."

03:26.380 --> 03:29.731
Amy doesn't cry often,
but when she does, oh, boy.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.299
- What do you mean?
- Oh, it's awful.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.301
It's like...

03:34.344 --> 03:37.391
No, it's, um...

03:37.434 --> 03:39.001
No, I can't do it.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.568
I would really like to see that.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.537
- Me too.
- Mm.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.407
Why are you lurking in the corner?

03:53.450 --> 03:55.322
I'm not lurking.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.802
I'm standing silently in the shadows.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.282
Lurking works, yeah.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.132
I'm just trying to stay out
of everyone's way, you know?

04:02.286 --> 04:04.287
Jonah, relax. It's a party.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.724
You should be mingling.
Go talk to someone

04:06.768 --> 04:08.683
about how second season
of "Patriot" gets better.

04:08.726 --> 04:09.727
It doesn't.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.555
See? This is a great conversation.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.904
Get out there.

04:12.948 --> 04:16.298
Oh, Mom, Dad! Come! Come here!

04:16.343 --> 04:17.909
- Just talk to them.
- I... I'm fine...

04:17.952 --> 04:19.694
You remember Jonah.

04:19.737 --> 04:22.827
- Hey, guys! Hey!
- Nice to see you.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.786
- Hi, Jonah.
- It's been a while. Hi.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.614
Er, yeah, yeah. It's good to see you.

04:26.657 --> 04:29.051
Connie, I love that dress.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.880
Somebody is ready for the red carpet.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.247
Thank you.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.405
You know, I think

04:35.449 --> 04:37.102
- you're running low on ice.
- I don't think we are.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.626
Well, nobody ever thinks
they're running low on ice

04:38.669 --> 04:40.715
until they're actually low
on ice, and then it's too late,

04:40.758 --> 04:43.065
so I'm gonna go get
some ice from outside.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.372
Uh, excuse me.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.767
It's his first quinceañera.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.726
If everybody could take their seats,

04:51.769 --> 04:53.771
we're gonna begin
the presentation of Emma

04:53.815 --> 04:55.730
and her court ofdamas y chambelanes

04:55.773 --> 04:57.167
in just a few minutes.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.343
They're breasts!

05:00.387 --> 05:02.649
- I wasn't... I was just...
- Uh-huh.

05:03.390 --> 05:06.480
It was a bold choice
to wear a dress like that

05:06.523 --> 05:08.482
at a party full
of a bunch of horny teens.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.092
You're really putting
the ladies out there.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.833
Why should I have to police my body

05:11.876 --> 05:13.748
because the men of this world
can't keep it in their pants?

05:13.791 --> 05:15.793
- I agree.
- I mean, if Emma was Wiccan,

05:15.837 --> 05:16.925
we would be all naked right now,

05:16.968 --> 05:18.361
dancing around a fire pentacle

05:18.405 --> 05:19.667
and grabbing each other's crotches.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.146
It really sounds like
you've done that before.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.227
A couple of times.

05:33.550 --> 05:37.380
And put your hands together
for Marco and Daniela.

05:42.951 --> 05:45.954
All right, and now,
everybody, on your feet.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.782
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you

05:47.825 --> 05:51.655
thequinceañera herself,
Emma Dubanowski!

05:55.224 --> 05:57.966
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, I didn't
realize you guys were...

05:58.009 --> 05:59.620
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, watch out.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.013
Oh, so sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry, I was getting ice.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.015
We can see that, big guy.
Just get out of the way.

06:04.059 --> 06:07.018
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm...

06:07.062 --> 06:08.150
Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.108
If you guys... just... just back up.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.415
I don't want anybody to slip.
It's... it's slippery.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.591
It's good to see Jonah again.

06:14.635 --> 06:15.940
I'm glad that's happening for you.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.681
- Thank you.
- You know what?

06:17.725 --> 06:19.030
We're gonna take a break
and clear the floor,

06:19.074 --> 06:20.292
so everyone just chill

06:20.336 --> 06:21.990
and we'll take it again from the top.

06:22.033 --> 06:25.472
Okay, again, very sorry.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.908
If you need anything, I'm just gonna...

06:26.951 --> 06:28.257
you don't need anything.
You guys are good.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.561
I'm... okay. I'm gonna
stop talking right now.

06:32.087 --> 06:35.220
So, uh, I'm gonna write down my email.

06:35.264 --> 06:38.049
If you could send me
a copy of this video,

06:38.093 --> 06:39.550
that would be great.

06:39.593 --> 06:43.423
It could be any file, any size.
I don't care.

06:45.607 --> 06:47.261
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

06:47.304 --> 06:48.523
If anything, you did her a favor.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.351
How many girls get to do
their entrance twice?

06:51.327 --> 06:54.102
One of the kids said,
"Smooth move, dick."

06:54.822 --> 06:56.277
Like, just so uncalled for.

06:56.771 --> 06:58.620
I'm sure most of them
didn't even notice.

06:59.689 --> 07:01.144
Look at them. Hey!

07:02.134 --> 07:04.191
Hey! Hey!

07:05.223 --> 07:05.758
Hello?

07:06.766 --> 07:07.542
Oh, my God.

07:08.569 --> 07:10.396
Look, I just want you to know

07:10.440 --> 07:12.268
that nothing happened
between Jonah and Amy

07:12.311 --> 07:13.617
while you guys were together.

07:13.661 --> 07:15.184
I mean, sure they kissed
during the tornado,

07:15.227 --> 07:16.315
but I'm pretty sure that was it.

07:16.359 --> 07:17.795
Well, thanks for letting me know that.

07:17.839 --> 07:20.145
Yeah. But then, of course,
there was the sex tape

07:20.189 --> 07:22.147
that happened at work.

07:22.191 --> 07:25.614
If it helps, we found out
later, Amy didn't finish.

07:26.587 --> 07:28.676
Jonah did, though, so...

07:29.299 --> 07:31.635
- Sorry about that.
- Buddy, cut it out.

07:31.679 --> 07:33.530
- Cut what out?
- Dude, look,

07:33.531 --> 07:35.596
I was your age once.
I was obsessed with breasts.

07:35.639 --> 07:37.293
I'm still a fan, but she's my friend,

07:37.336 --> 07:38.816
so stop staring at her.

07:38.860 --> 07:42.080
I wasn't. I don't care about
some lady's fake boobs.

07:42.124 --> 07:43.299
Okay, all right.

07:43.342 --> 07:44.866
Well, they're real, but whatever.

07:44.909 --> 07:46.607
They're totally fake.

07:46.650 --> 07:48.347
You can tell when they're
too round like that.

07:48.391 --> 07:50.219
Dude, don't act like
you know about breasts.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.699
I dated her. They're real.

07:51.742 --> 07:52.705
You dated her?

07:53.570 --> 07:54.702
So you've, like, seen them?

07:54.745 --> 07:56.660
Yeah. When adults date each other,

07:56.704 --> 07:58.227
they show each other their boobs.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.229
What are they like? Are they awesome?

08:00.272 --> 08:03.313
Buddy, I'm not telling you about that.

08:04.712 --> 08:06.714
But the right one's a little
perkier than the left one,

08:06.757 --> 08:09.368
but not in like a weird
Picasso kind of way,

08:09.412 --> 08:11.762
and they're sort of spread out,
but not like Admiral Ackbar.

08:11.806 --> 08:13.198
It's like they're...

08:13.242 --> 08:14.739
You know what?

08:15.374 --> 08:17.463
I'll just draw 'em for ya. Come on.

08:19.422 --> 08:21.772
And on this day of your quinceañera,

08:21.816 --> 08:26.124
I wanted to get you
something muy especial, so...

08:27.343 --> 08:28.474
Holy [bleep].

08:28.518 --> 08:31.390
It's the traditional last doll,

08:31.434 --> 08:32.740
última muñeca.

08:32.783 --> 08:35.438
Jerusha and I worked
really hard on this.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.525
Do you like it?

08:36.568 --> 08:38.571
Yes, mm-hmm. Just say thank you.

08:38.615 --> 08:40.616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:40.660 --> 08:42.706
Oh, if you're wondering
why the hair looks so real?

08:42.750 --> 08:44.229
Because it is.

08:44.273 --> 08:47.145
Yeah, Jerusha got her hair
caught in the garbage disposal,

08:47.189 --> 08:50.192
so, you know, we saved it for you.

08:50.235 --> 08:51.445
Thank you.

08:52.716 --> 08:54.703
Put her away.

08:55.632 --> 08:57.590
- Keep her safe.
- Yeah.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.514
Emma, if I could give you any advice,

09:08.558 --> 09:10.429
it would be,
never give your virtue away.

09:10.473 --> 09:13.432
Hold it, protect it until you meet

09:13.476 --> 09:15.304
that special man
that you will call husband.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.697
This is, like,
the fifth speech in a row

09:16.740 --> 09:17.915
about Emma's virginity.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.221
- It's weird.
- I know.

09:19.264 --> 09:22.441
It's like, who hasn't lost
their virginity by 15?

09:22.485 --> 09:24.530
Studies show that
pushing abstinence on kids

09:24.574 --> 09:25.967
actually makes them
want to have sex more.

09:26.010 --> 09:27.751
Or it encourages them
to try butt stuff,

09:27.795 --> 09:29.710
which, hey, God bless.

09:29.753 --> 09:33.670
So it kind of curves
up here to décolletage.

09:33.714 --> 09:34.758
That's a crumb.

09:34.802 --> 09:37.326
That's not, like, a third nipple.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.994
Then over here,
there's sort of a quick little dip,

09:39.995 --> 09:42.679
like that first drop
in Batman: The Ride.

09:42.723 --> 09:45.334
And I know it seems like
I'm spending a lot of time

09:45.377 --> 09:49.381
on the sternum, but it's really
all about that negative space.

09:49.425 --> 09:51.340
Because losing
the precious gift of chastity

09:51.383 --> 09:53.298
would be the biggest mistake
of your life,

09:53.342 --> 09:55.257
almost as big a mistake
as when this guy

09:55.300 --> 09:56.519
ruined your big entrance.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.481
From before, yeah. Zing.

10:08.705 --> 10:11.494
Because, as we all know,

10:12.274 --> 10:16.713
the unopened chips
always stays the freshest.

10:16.757 --> 10:18.367
Thank you.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.803
Ah, who's next?

10:19.847 --> 10:21.674
Oh, God, no. Pass.

10:21.718 --> 10:23.807
Ouch, so cold.

10:23.851 --> 10:26.984
I don't... I don't mean pass
like I-I-I don't care.

10:27.028 --> 10:29.378
I just... uh...

10:29.421 --> 10:30.858
I... sorry, when I...

10:30.901 --> 10:32.381
when I said, "Pass,"

10:32.424 --> 10:33.904
I just meant, like,
I don't want to say anything.

10:33.948 --> 10:37.560
Not... sorry,
not because I don't like Emma.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.868
It's just, it feels silly
for me to be giving a speech

10:40.911 --> 10:43.636
when I'm not even
a part of the family yet.

10:43.637 --> 10:45.394
- Oh!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.830
That doesn't... that's not a... no.

10:46.874 --> 10:48.049
Don't read into the word "yet," no.

10:48.092 --> 10:49.169
Believe me, we're...

10:49.170 --> 10:51.052
We're not getting married, okay?

10:51.095 --> 10:52.488
I mean, I don't mean that we're never...

10:52.531 --> 10:53.794
we're never gonna get married.

10:53.837 --> 10:55.447
I mean, we haven't even

10:55.491 --> 10:57.090
talked about it, right?

10:57.091 --> 10:59.321
You know what? I should probably

10:59.364 --> 11:00.888
just stick with the standard script

11:00.931 --> 11:03.586
and say, um, congrats, Emma,

11:03.629 --> 11:07.808
and I guess stay a virgin
or don't... or don't.

11:07.851 --> 11:11.028
You know, that's...
your sexuality is your own.

11:11.072 --> 11:12.377
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:12.421 --> 11:16.400
Thank you for those kind words, Jonah.

11:16.991 --> 11:18.775
- Here.
- Just...

11:19.582 --> 11:22.387
But, uh, we got some more
partying to do, folks.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.564
I budgeted six shrimp
per person, so go to town.

11:25.608 --> 11:27.697
And if there aren't any more toasts...

11:27.740 --> 11:30.526
Actually, Amy, uh, I just
wanted to say a few words

11:30.569 --> 11:31.919
on the topic of female pleasure...

11:33.703 --> 11:36.662
Oops, it's... it's broken.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.542
Hi.

11:43.802 --> 11:45.324
How are you doing?

11:46.062 --> 11:48.368
Fantastic. Life of the party.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.330
Man, I am so tired.

11:53.373 --> 11:55.506
I really wish I could go home now.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.290
You can, though, if you wanted to.

11:57.334 --> 11:59.989
You know, if you're...
if you're feeling beat.

12:00.032 --> 12:01.555
I mean, it's only 8:30.

12:01.599 --> 12:05.472
Oh, okay, only 8:30,
Mr. Party All Night.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.257
I wish I could be in bed
with a good book.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.674
Doesn't that sound great?

12:08.675 --> 12:11.391
You've literally never read in bed.

12:11.435 --> 12:14.046
You play "Candy Crush"
until you're snoring.

12:14.090 --> 12:16.570
Ha! Yeah, that's true.
I love that game.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.183
- Maybe I should take off.
- No, no.

12:20.990 --> 12:21.967
That's... that's not what I want.

12:22.011 --> 12:26.276
I-I want you be here,
just not so noticeably.

12:26.319 --> 12:29.540
- That's what I want.
- Fingers crossed.

12:31.454 --> 12:32.789
Excuse me.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.980
Were you the one who drew
these breasts for my child?

12:35.024 --> 12:37.113
What? No. What? Who's your son?

12:37.156 --> 12:38.331
In the future, I'd appreciate

12:38.375 --> 12:40.507
if you didn't give
pornography to my child.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.385
- Mm-hmm.
- He's a child.

12:42.814 --> 12:44.103
Got it, child.

12:44.424 --> 12:45.686
Those are my breasts.

12:45.730 --> 12:49.429
What? No. I drew those from scratch.

12:49.473 --> 12:50.996
I think I'd recognize my own breasts.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.606
I have over 40 mirrors in my house.

12:52.650 --> 12:54.652
Okay, fine, yeah, they're your breasts,

12:54.695 --> 12:56.436
but it was just that this nerd kid

12:56.480 --> 12:58.569
said that they were fake, and
I was like, "No, they're not."

12:58.612 --> 13:00.005
And he's like, "Yes, they are," so I...

13:00.049 --> 13:01.615
This is a really
impressive level of detail.

13:01.659 --> 13:03.008
Did you just do this from memory?

13:03.052 --> 13:04.053
Yeah.

13:04.096 --> 13:05.880
Wow. I guess I didn't realize

13:05.881 --> 13:07.186
how obsessed you are with me.

13:07.230 --> 13:07.931
What?

13:08.666 --> 13:10.233
Well, it's almost sad.

13:10.276 --> 13:12.104
Poor Garrett, pining after a woman

13:12.148 --> 13:13.671
who barely knows he's alive.

13:13.714 --> 13:15.716
No, I think you are reading
way too much into a drawing.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.855
I draw Garfield too.

13:16.856 --> 13:18.710
I don't want to have sex
with Garfield. I'm not Jon.

13:20.721 --> 13:23.681
Stop!

13:23.724 --> 13:26.249
Emma is the spitting image
of you by the way.

13:26.292 --> 13:29.310
Oh, I know. I'm trying not to cry.

13:30.427 --> 13:33.125
Yesterday she was this
little girl in pigtails

13:33.169 --> 13:34.257
running around the house,

13:34.300 --> 13:37.173
and now she's this smart, confident,

13:37.216 --> 13:38.391
beautiful young woman.

13:38.435 --> 13:40.222
You must be so proud.

13:40.785 --> 13:41.764
I am.

13:42.482 --> 13:46.051
And pretty soon, you're
gonna be at her graduation

13:46.095 --> 13:49.363
and then her wedding, then her funeral.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.317
What?

13:51.361 --> 13:54.451
I mean, you know, someday. Not now.

13:54.494 --> 13:55.983
She's not gonna live forever.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.031
Hopefully you'll die first.

13:58.907 --> 13:59.668
Okay.

14:01.387 --> 14:02.693
I'm gonna go, um,

14:03.851 --> 14:06.581
mingle with some other... over there.

14:07.969 --> 14:09.091
She didn't mean it.

14:09.814 --> 14:13.078
- Oh.
- Wow, she is a robot.

14:18.910 --> 14:20.607
Hey, have you tried these?

14:20.651 --> 14:23.697
These are called pastelitos de perro.

14:23.741 --> 14:26.396
It's a traditional Honduran food.

14:26.439 --> 14:28.180
Those are pizza rolls.

14:28.839 --> 14:29.703
Oh.

14:29.747 --> 14:31.575
The Honduran food is here.

14:31.618 --> 14:33.533
Oh, well, that's what I want.

14:33.577 --> 14:35.709
I'm not some boring gringo, you know.

14:35.753 --> 14:38.190
Well, give that spice.
Show me the mole.

14:38.234 --> 14:41.280
Oh, that's it.

Do you have the dead grandma
song from "Coco"?

15:30.199 --> 15:32.679
No, no, maybe we should get
back to the dancing.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.028
I think you're gonna wanna hear this.

15:34.072 --> 15:35.421
You're gonna wanna
hear this, definitely.

15:35.465 --> 15:37.423
Like at night, when
you fantasize about me,

15:37.467 --> 15:40.383
do you think of a specific
incident of us having sex,

15:40.426 --> 15:42.428
or is it more just picturing me
there in the moment?

15:42.472 --> 15:44.558
- Please stop.
- All right.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.564
If you're not obsessed with me,
then I guess you won't care

15:47.607 --> 15:49.174
if I ask McLovin over there to dance.

15:49.218 --> 15:51.568
- Be my guest.
- Okay, I will.

15:51.611 --> 15:53.483
Hey, acne... Let's dance.

15:53.526 --> 15:56.747
Me? Yeah. Sure. We did
ballroom in gym one time.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.836
Oh, good.

16:03.063 --> 16:03.772
Hey.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.462
Hey.

16:06.496 --> 16:07.801
Everything all right?

16:08.846 --> 16:10.245
Yeah, I hear ya.

16:11.979 --> 16:14.547
Look, I'm sorry about all
the... you know, the ice

16:14.591 --> 16:18.247
and the speech, the towel incident.

16:18.290 --> 16:20.510
I really didn't think
that you were home.

16:22.599 --> 16:24.262
I...

16:25.341 --> 16:28.779
I really like your Mom
and I know she loves you

16:28.822 --> 16:31.651
and then I get all in my head
about wanting you to like me.

16:31.695 --> 16:32.994
And then...

16:34.031 --> 16:35.296
I am so high.

16:36.047 --> 16:37.806
- What?
- I'm freaking out.

16:38.658 --> 16:39.417
Oh.

16:56.023 --> 16:58.243
My cousin Marco brought a vape pen,

16:58.287 --> 17:00.289
and, at first, I didn't feel anything

17:00.332 --> 17:01.899
and so I did some more

17:01.942 --> 17:04.117
and then I wasn't even sure
if there was anything in it

17:04.162 --> 17:05.278
because Marco is a liar

17:05.279 --> 17:07.992
and now I am very feeling
something a lot.

17:08.035 --> 17:10.864
Okay, okay,
it's... it's... it's gonna be okay.

17:10.907 --> 17:12.866
I feel like my heart's
filling with blood.

17:12.910 --> 17:14.954
Then it's doing its job.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.218
Listen, you know what I'm gonna do?

17:16.261 --> 17:17.262
I'm gonna get your Mom...

17:17.306 --> 17:19.089
No, no, you can't tell my parents.

17:19.133 --> 17:21.744
Right. Right. Right. Okay. Okay.

17:21.788 --> 17:25.878
Well, then we're just gonna
sit here and ride it out.

17:25.923 --> 17:29.231
Hey, can I sit with my little princess?

17:29.274 --> 17:30.884
Nah, we're good.

17:30.928 --> 17:32.110
I'd like to sit
with my granddaughter...

17:32.111 --> 17:33.075
Connie, please!

17:39.371 --> 17:42.113
The kid says he thinks
I'm hotter than Tia Carrere.

17:42.156 --> 17:44.071
- Well, no, I...
- Yeah, yeah.

17:44.115 --> 17:45.638
He's super into me!

17:45.682 --> 17:47.041
Okay, cool.

17:49.207 --> 17:50.339
What is she doing?

17:50.382 --> 17:52.341
She's trying to seduce
a 15-year-old kid

17:52.384 --> 17:53.899
in order to make me jealous.

17:54.775 --> 17:56.821
- Is it working?
- Not really.

17:57.084 --> 17:58.956
This is a really nice party.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.044
You know, this whole tent

18:01.060 --> 18:02.570
and the DJ and the centerpieces...

18:02.571 --> 18:05.163
you went... I mean, you went for it.

18:05.164 --> 18:06.963
Yeah, yeah, I did, thank you.

18:07.069 --> 18:10.110
It was really nice
to be able to this for her.

18:10.278 --> 18:10.884
Yeah.

18:11.234 --> 18:13.105
And when it's time for her wedding,

18:13.141 --> 18:16.398
I will...
I will handle the lion's share.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.368
Yeah, yeah, don't sweat it.

18:18.369 --> 18:19.837
It's good. I got it covered.

18:19.838 --> 18:23.276
I actually just bought
some stock in a drone company,

18:23.277 --> 18:25.116
so it's gonna even out pretty quick.

18:27.311 --> 18:28.484
Sounds promising.

18:28.485 --> 18:30.245
Those things are gonna be everywhere,

18:31.030 --> 18:31.956
flying.

18:34.365 --> 18:36.429
This is my first quinceañera!

18:36.782 --> 18:39.344
I love your Latinx traditions.

18:40.221 --> 18:41.836
Huh? How am I doing?

18:41.970 --> 18:42.727
All right,

18:42.728 --> 18:44.660
I'd like to ask everybody
to please clear the floor.

18:44.703 --> 18:46.357
It's now time for
the father-daughter dance.

18:46.401 --> 18:48.272
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

18:48.316 --> 18:49.447
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

18:49.491 --> 18:51.275
- It's gonna be fine.
- He's gonna know.

18:51.319 --> 18:53.756
He's gonna know.
No, he's not gonna know.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.854
You can do this.

18:56.149 --> 18:57.368
Okay. Okay.

18:57.412 --> 18:58.466
Gonna be great.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.903
Okay, maybe just try to walk normal.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.340
Is this not normal?

19:12.383 --> 19:14.342
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this is... this is great.

19:14.385 --> 19:16.779
This is how people walk. You got it.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.174
- She looks nervous.
- It's fine.

19:21.218 --> 19:23.786
♪ When I'm afraid?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.744
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:25.788 --> 19:27.147
You know what? Sorry.

19:27.148 --> 19:29.835
Uh, I think, actually, we're
gonna try and squeeze one in,

19:29.879 --> 19:31.750
uh, before the father-daughter.

19:31.794 --> 19:32.882
What?

19:32.925 --> 19:34.879
And this is the song we practiced to.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.800
Yeah, uh, well,
we can play it again for you.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.672
You know, I'm sure the DJ has
a repeat button on the thing.

19:40.716 --> 19:42.108
- What?
- Jonah.

19:42.152 --> 19:44.285
- Hmm?
- You need to sit down.

19:44.328 --> 19:47.766
No, no, not until
this song is over, at least,

19:47.810 --> 19:51.335
and maybe... maybe just a few
more after that, you know?

19:51.379 --> 19:53.816
You're makin' it weird, dog.
Just let her go.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.208
Let her go!

19:55.252 --> 19:57.298
Not... not gonna happen, Connie.

19:59.822 --> 20:02.259
So this has one terabyte on it.

20:02.303 --> 20:04.348
If you could just put all
the raw footage on there.

20:04.392 --> 20:06.307
You don't have to edit it.
I'll take care of that.

20:08.396 --> 20:09.616
This is fun.

20:17.056 --> 20:20.451
I know. I'm sorry.
I ruined the quinceañera.

20:20.495 --> 20:23.019
I made it weird.
I-I-I don't know why I...

20:23.062 --> 20:23.885
She was high.

20:25.064 --> 20:26.072
She told me.

20:26.805 --> 20:27.490
Ah.

20:27.937 --> 20:30.151
That was a very nice thing you did.

20:31.419 --> 20:33.334
But, uh, for future reference,

20:33.377 --> 20:36.380
the next time my child
is on drugs, tell me.

20:36.424 --> 20:37.360
Got it.

20:38.077 --> 20:40.515
I did see Parker snorting cocaine

20:40.558 --> 20:42.517
off his "Paw Patrol" table last week.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.996
Oh, yeah, no, I knew about that one.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.304
Hey, Amy, you've gotta see
this video of a deaf kid

20:47.348 --> 20:49.262
hearing his mother's voice
for the first time.

20:49.306 --> 20:51.047
Um, I'm okay, thank you.

20:51.090 --> 20:53.049
It's really moving, though.

20:53.092 --> 20:54.398
Just not... not right now.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.315
Ow!

20:58.839 --> 21:01.449
Ow! What the hell, Cheyenne?

21:01.492 --> 21:03.973
Um, uh, I'm sorry.

21:04.016 --> 21:06.149
I was just trying something.
It didn't work, okay.

21:06.192 --> 21:07.933
Sorry, night, okay.

21:11.284 --> 21:13.286
You really should've kick her back.
