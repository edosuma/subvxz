Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.336 --> 00:05.733
You're still digging out
from the hit you took

00:05.734 --> 00:07.134
when Teddy's development went bust.

00:07.135 --> 00:10.174
Bottom line, Joe. Stop spending money.

00:10.175 --> 00:13.133
You think he's lying about something.

00:13.134 --> 00:15.713
A mayor with secrets is easier to control.

00:15.714 --> 00:18.053
What is his problem with my career?

00:18.054 --> 00:20.967
He hates your career because of mom.

00:20.968 --> 00:25.217
Mom had a singer/songwriter friend.
You mean like an affair?

00:25.218 --> 00:27.341
You've proven to have the same disregard

00:27.342 --> 00:30.091
for your marriage that she did for ours.

00:30.092 --> 00:31.412
I'm trying to do the right thing,

00:31.413 --> 00:33.051
but none of it feels right to me.

00:33.052 --> 00:35.431
I feel like I need to be letting you go.

00:35.432 --> 00:37.011
So why don't you, Ray?

00:37.012 --> 00:39.671
My mother is a drug addict.

00:39.672 --> 00:43.171
I need you. There was a time
when I needed you, too.

00:43.172 --> 00:46.051
I'm your mama!

00:46.052 --> 00:47.511
Your girlfriend's got it.

00:47.512 --> 00:50.131
I think she feels like you
might, you know, leave her.

Deacon Claybourne on my tour?

00:52.533 --> 00:53.171
I want him.

00:53.172 --> 00:54.652
You deserve someone you can count on.

I don't think she can hear you.

02:59.932 --> 03:01.721
No, she heard you.

03:01.722 --> 03:03.221
It's called selective listening.

03:03.222 --> 03:06.761
I was texting Virginia about my homework.

03:20.632 --> 03:22.591
You should sing. I could sing.
Would that help?

03:22.592 --> 03:25.971
Well, Teddy wouldn't say so,
But, yes, that would help.

03:25.972 --> 03:27.971
Easy. Done. Just tell me where and when.

03:27.972 --> 03:30.011
It's at the country club.

Mom, there's this video online.

You're not gonna believe it.

03:33.802 --> 03:36.592
It's about Juliette Barnes.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.530
At least something made without raisins.

03:49.531 --> 03:50.491
You know I hate raisins.

03:50.492 --> 03:52.092
All right, Makena's on her way to J.F.K.

03:52.093 --> 03:53.511
Makena? Yeah.

03:53.512 --> 03:55.881
Why? Doesn't she have Kristen
Stewart to worry about?

03:55.882 --> 03:58.261
When you're at the center
of a publicity nightmare,

03:58.262 --> 03:59.761
you generally need your publicist.

03:59.762 --> 04:02.091
- You're kidding me, baby.
- You got no milk.

04:02.092 --> 04:04.841
I cannot believe she has to stay here.

04:04.842 --> 04:06.551

04:06.552 --> 04:08.801
in the last 48 hours, that's
what you can't believe?

04:08.802 --> 04:10.931
You know what, Glenn? You need to relax.

04:10.932 --> 04:13.092
As Makena would say, any
publicity is good publicity.

04:13.093 --> 04:15.472
Yeah, well, I don't
think she'd say that.

04:16.841 --> 04:18.051

04:30.222 --> 04:31.221
It was long.

04:31.222 --> 04:33.261
They make you show up at 6:00.

04:33.262 --> 04:35.131

04:41.623 --> 04:42.983
from a phone that's never ringing.

04:42.984 --> 04:44.301
Well, look, just the fact

04:44.302 --> 04:46.381
that you got to record a
demo with watty white...

04:46.382 --> 04:48.841
I mean, people would kill
for that opportunity.

04:48.842 --> 04:50.801

All you can control is
what you put out there,

04:53.172 --> 04:56.631
not whether some publisher
will be interested.

04:56.632 --> 04:58.272
Yeah, well, I just wish They'd tell me no

04:58.273 --> 04:59.593
so I could put it out of my mind.

04:59.594 --> 05:02.972

My sister.

06:23.882 --> 06:24.971
The mouth of the south.

06:24.972 --> 06:26.261
Right. She's also the one

06:26.262 --> 06:27.748
who told me about this fund-Raiser.

06:27.749 --> 06:29.989

that she's talking about,

06:29.990 --> 06:31.430

07:17.782 --> 07:19.471
Why don't you just mind your own business?

07:21.262 --> 07:22.761
Can't you do something with her,

07:22.762 --> 07:24.631

07:24.632 --> 07:26.551
That's for the judge to

08:26.489 --> 08:27.695
Hi, to you, too.

08:27.696 --> 08:29.485

08:29.486 --> 08:31.326
We need to get the
statement out immediately.

08:31.327 --> 08:32.775
No. No release.

08:39.610 --> 08:41.820
Says your fans who bought
tickets to your concert.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.900
They at least need some
sort of explanation.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.461
Now we need to get ahead of this thing,

08:45.462 --> 08:46.822
or else the fallout could be huge,

08:46.823 --> 08:49.235
so I have scheduled an

08:50.656 --> 08:52.655

09:37.029 --> 09:40.318
Yeah. All right. I'll be there.

09:44.109 --> 09:45.858

09:57.109 --> 10:00.198
The same thing.

10:07.029 --> 10:09.778
And this is my office.

10:09.779 --> 10:12.198
That is what we call the wall of fame...

10:12.199 --> 10:14.777
People who started out
with publishing deals,

10:14.778 --> 10:16.658
just like y'all, hoping
for that famous singer

10:16.659 --> 10:17.988
to cut one of their songs.

10:17.989 --> 10:19.528
Come on. Let's keep going.

10:19.529 --> 10:22.198
Down the hall we've
got the writers' rooms.

10:22.199 --> 10:23.568
We'll show you in a minute.

10:23.569 --> 10:25.528
Out back there's a patio.
Feel free to use it

10:25.529 --> 10:27.568
whenever you're just
restin' and not workin',

10:27.569 --> 10:31.108
and in here is the kitchen
that is available to you 24/7,

10:31.109 --> 10:32.488
and it is fully stocked.

10:32.489 --> 10:34.658
You mind? No. Go ahead.

10:34.659 --> 10:36.398
Come on. I'll show you the writers' rooms.

10:36.399 --> 10:39.279
They're down this way.

10:42.399 --> 10:44.278
That's mine.

10:44.279 --> 10:47.698
Sorry. Jeanne said I could.

10:47.699 --> 10:50.108
Should've put my name on it. Hailey.

10:50.109 --> 10:52.568
Gunnar. I'm new here.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.858
I know. I'm Jeanne's assistant.

10:54.859 --> 10:57.608
I-I heard your demo... "Fade
Into You."

10:57.609 --> 11:00.818
literally, I-I cannot stop
playing that in my car.

11:00.819 --> 11:02.238
Hey, we lost you.

11:02.239 --> 11:03.778
Sorry. I was just meeting Hailey.

11:03.779 --> 11:05.608
Hailey, this is Scarlett, my partner. Hey.

11:05.609 --> 11:07.528
My... My w-writing partner.

11:07.529 --> 11:08.818
Nice to meet you.

11:08.819 --> 11:11.818
Jeanne wants to take
us to dinner tonight.

11:11.819 --> 11:13.659
We take all the new
writers out to celebrate.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.658
How many, should I
make for the reservation?

11:15.659 --> 11:17.699
You can invite whoever you
want... your boyfriend,

11:17.700 --> 11:20.818
or your girlfriend or...
Whatever floats your boat.

11:20.819 --> 11:22.779
I should bring my boyfriend
if that's all right.

11:22.780 --> 11:23.740
Yeah. My boat's just me.

11:23.741 --> 11:25.898
at the moment. It's a... kayak.

11:25.899 --> 11:29.899
We'll see
you later tonight. Come on.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.818
Have a good first day, and,

11:31.819 --> 11:34.659
keep your mitts off my yogurt.

11:47.739 --> 11:49.238
We're bringing in everything,

11:49.239 --> 11:52.068
so if it's up to you whether
you use the full band or no.

11:52.069 --> 11:53.488
Yeah. Yeah?

11:53.489 --> 11:55.898
You know... if the guys
are willing to do it,

11:55.899 --> 11:57.778
let's give these people a show.

11:57.779 --> 11:59.017
Sure.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.698
You know what? We'll
probably have to get

12:00.699 --> 12:02.219
somebody else for lead guitar, though.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.260
There's no way Deacon's
gonna wanna do this thing.

12:04.261 --> 12:05.941
Well, I assumed we
would be using Deacon.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.448
Unh-Unh. He
hates all this kind of thing...

12:08.449 --> 12:11.658
Country club, daddy's gonna be there.

12:11.659 --> 12:13.699
No, no. I mean, shoot, I
don't even wanna do this,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.340
so there's no way he's gonna wanna do it.

12:15.341 --> 12:17.028
Well, I-I talked to him about it,

12:17.029 --> 12:19.658
and he didn't have a problem with it.
You did?

12:19.659 --> 12:21.687
Yeah. I mean, if you
want me to call him back

12:21.688 --> 12:23.488
and tell him you changed
your mind, I can...

12:23.489 --> 12:24.858
No. No, no, no. He said that?

12:24.859 --> 12:26.608
He said it wouldn't be an issue.

12:26.609 --> 12:28.739
All right.

12:30.279 --> 12:32.659
If he can deal with it,
I can deal with it.

12:39.569 --> 12:41.988
Katia was thinking this would
be perfect for "Tumbleweed."

12:41.989 --> 12:44.658
Really? Well, I look like a hillbilly.

12:44.659 --> 12:46.568
Yeah. You kinda do.

12:46.569 --> 12:48.568
According to the notes,

12:48.569 --> 12:50.488
it's straight off the runways in Paris.

12:50.489 --> 12:53.528
Okay, well, here are my notes.
This does not look sexy.

12:53.529 --> 12:55.778
This looks poor. I kinda like it.

12:55.779 --> 12:57.778
Well, you would.

12:57.779 --> 13:00.068
Maybe next year.

13:00.069 --> 13:01.318
Glenn?

13:03.239 --> 13:05.858
You cannot be serious about this outfit.

13:05.859 --> 13:08.698
What?

13:08.699 --> 13:10.068
I just got off the phone

13:10.069 --> 13:12.028
with the executive
producer of the C.M.A.s.

13:12.029 --> 13:13.207
You're welcome to attend,

13:13.208 --> 13:15.448
but they're removing you from
their list of presenters.

13:15.449 --> 13:17.004
What?

13:17.005 --> 13:18.965
You know, this isn't the
first call I've gotten.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.246
You're the butt of every joke
on the late-Night circuit.

13:21.247 --> 13:22.687
"S.N.L." Is doing an opening sketch,

13:22.688 --> 13:23.488
for crying out loud.

13:23.489 --> 13:25.249
You know, I know you
don't wanna hear this,

13:25.250 --> 13:27.170
but as quickly as you
came up in this business,

13:27.171 --> 13:28.531
that's how fast you can disappear.

13:28.532 --> 13:30.528
People like Martina
Mcbride, Rayna James...

13:30.529 --> 13:33.398
Their longevity wasn't a given.
They had to earn it.

13:33.399 --> 13:35.988
And as good as you are,

13:35.989 --> 13:37.778
you haven't earned it yet.

13:37.779 --> 13:39.028
He's right.

13:39.029 --> 13:41.738
This is a make-or-break moment.

13:41.739 --> 13:44.988
You have got one shot to
set the record straight,

13:44.989 --> 13:48.658
to be the person the world thinks you are.

13:48.659 --> 13:50.068
You wanna keep living this life?

13:50.069 --> 13:52.359
I suggest you take it.

13:57.659 --> 13:59.949
Schedule the "G.M.A." interview.

14:02.279 --> 14:04.069
I'll do it.

14:17.761 --> 14:20.590
So I packed up my car in Austin,

14:20.591 --> 14:21.590
drove to Nashville,

14:21.591 --> 14:23.390
and started knocking on people's doors

14:23.391 --> 14:25.680
till somebody hired me.

14:25.681 --> 14:28.510
I was lucky enough to
land at The Bluebird.

14:28.511 --> 14:31.590
That was almost three years ago.

14:31.591 --> 14:33.550
And you? How about you?

14:33.551 --> 14:35.930
How'd you get out here?
How'd you start writing?

14:35.931 --> 14:38.800
Actually, I came out here
'cause when I first met Avery,

14:38.801 --> 14:41.680
it's where he wanted to be, always.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.550
The writing thing was kind of an accident.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.470
When I was little, my mama taught me that

14:46.471 --> 14:49.050
song lyrics were just poems put to music.

14:49.051 --> 14:51.261
And she used to get the little cd jackets

14:51.262 --> 14:52.801
with the lyrics printed on the inside

14:52.802 --> 14:54.511
so I'd know what I was singing along to.

14:54.512 --> 14:55.881
And soon as I could write,

14:55.882 --> 14:58.381
I started trying to write
my own poems and stories.

15:00.012 --> 15:01.171
And you love it?

15:01.172 --> 15:03.801
Yeah, I... I do.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.511
It's just always amazed me,

15:05.512 --> 15:07.511
when you're trying to create an image,

15:07.512 --> 15:08.881
the difference that a word makes.

15:08.882 --> 15:10.921
A-and the more specific
you get with that image,

15:10.922 --> 15:13.841
the more universal it becomes.

15:13.842 --> 15:15.711
I... if you know what I mean.

15:15.712 --> 15:17.341
I don't want to go on and on, though.

15:17.342 --> 15:19.131
Obviously, I'm just starting out.

15:19.132 --> 15:20.652
And you're better than a lot of people

15:20.653 --> 15:23.213
who have been out here doing it
for a lot longer than you have.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.551
Thank you.

15:24.552 --> 15:27.751
And her uncle is Deacon Claybourne.

15:28.842 --> 15:31.421
Well, that explains a lot.
Quite a pedigree.

15:31.422 --> 15:33.421
Actually, a lot of what I
learned is from Avery.

15:33.422 --> 15:35.091
He's an incredible songwriter.

15:35.092 --> 15:36.881
Come on, Scarlett. It's true. You are.

15:36.882 --> 15:38.511
Stop it.

15:38.512 --> 15:40.912
No, they have a band. They play
at the 5 Spot all the time.

15:40.913 --> 15:41.993
And they're really amazing.

15:41.994 --> 15:44.511
That's enough, really.

15:44.512 --> 15:47.841
No, 5 Spot's great. Good for you.

15:47.842 --> 15:50.841
Yeah, well, I love playing there...

15:50.842 --> 15:54.552
or anywhere, really.

15:56.930 --> 15:59.559
So where are you from, Hailey?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.429
Colorado, weirdly.

16:01.430 --> 16:04.309
Why weirdly?

16:04.310 --> 16:06.230
We're still missing a few
host committee folks,

16:06.231 --> 16:07.778
but we'll go ahead and get started.

16:07.779 --> 16:09.658
Rayna, we are just absolutely thrilled

16:09.659 --> 16:10.948
that you're doing this.

16:10.949 --> 16:12.589
It's gonna be like old home week for you.

16:12.590 --> 16:13.950
The tickets just flew out the door

16:13.951 --> 16:15.858
once everyone found out you'd be singing.

16:15.859 --> 16:17.377
Well, I'm thrilled to be here,

16:17.378 --> 16:18.618
and, you know, it'll be so nice

16:18.619 --> 16:20.488
to see so many old familiar faces.

16:20.489 --> 16:22.068
Peggy, there you are.

16:22.069 --> 16:23.238
Hey!

16:23.239 --> 16:25.318
Sorry. I got hung up at work.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.639
I thought I'd missed the meeting.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.948
Hi, Peggy.

16:27.949 --> 16:29.318
Rayna.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.158
How are you? It's been a long time.

16:31.159 --> 16:32.278
I know.

16:32.279 --> 16:34.119
I didn't see your name
on the host committee.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.680
I didn't know that you were doing this.

16:35.681 --> 16:37.028
I go by Margaret. Kenter now.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.618
I married Robert.

16:38.619 --> 16:41.238
Right. Robert. I saw
that in the society pages.

16:41.239 --> 16:42.698
Yeah. Hey there, Peggy.

16:42.699 --> 16:44.698
Hey!

16:44.699 --> 16:46.528
Thanks for doing this. Appreciate it.

16:46.529 --> 16:47.948
Happy to.

16:47.949 --> 16:49.669
Always said you'd make a
great politician.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.278
Well, we'll see.

16:54.029 --> 16:55.238
You got it.

16:55.239 --> 16:56.448
Thank you so much. Good night.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.408
Bye.

16:57.409 --> 16:59.028
Well, it's still early.

16:59.029 --> 17:00.908
Y'all up for another round?

17:00.909 --> 17:02.118
Yeah. Sure.

17:02.119 --> 17:03.818
I think we'll call it a night.

17:03.819 --> 17:05.579
Yeah. I guess it's been
kind of a long day.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.738
We can go.

17:07.739 --> 17:09.318
You sure?

17:09.319 --> 17:11.318
Yep. I'll, see you guys later.

17:11.319 --> 17:12.318
See ya. All right.

17:12.319 --> 17:13.318
Bye.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.657
Are you all right?

17:15.659 --> 17:17.528
Yeah. Just wanna go home.

17:17.529 --> 17:19.528
You're welcome to go out if you want to.

17:19.529 --> 17:21.238
I-is this because I said something

17:21.239 --> 17:23.157
about your music to Jeanne?

17:23.159 --> 17:24.948
You know what?

17:24.949 --> 17:27.117
You know I hate it when you do that.

17:27.118 --> 17:28.448
D-Do what?

17:28.449 --> 17:30.658
I don't need your help. Okay?

17:30.659 --> 17:32.028
No, I...

17:32.029 --> 17:33.869
I've got my band. My
music Speaks for itself.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.510
And what the hell was up with all that...

17:35.511 --> 17:37.028
That writing process crap anyway?

17:37.029 --> 17:39.908
I mean, since when did you
become an expert in...

17:43.739 --> 17:45.528
You know what?

17:45.529 --> 17:47.658
I'm... I'm just gonna walk.

17:47.659 --> 17:49.659
Baby, you can't walk home.
Just get in the truck.

17:49.660 --> 17:51.118
Scarlett...

17:52.319 --> 17:54.199
Just let me go.

18:00.319 --> 18:02.319
I thought the whole
thing went pretty Well, yeah?

18:02.320 --> 18:04.488
Yeah. -But why didn't you tell me

18:04.489 --> 18:07.778
that, old Peggy is
on the host committee?

18:07.779 --> 18:09.778
I don't know. It never
even crossed my mind.

18:11.029 --> 18:12.528
She's still got the hots for you.

18:12.529 --> 18:13.908
What's that?

18:13.909 --> 18:15.318
What's that? What's that?

18:15.319 --> 18:17.119
She's got the hots for me?
I don't think so.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.318
It's been 15 years.

18:18.319 --> 18:19.698
What are you getting at anyway?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.318
I don't know. Just...

18:21.319 --> 18:23.988
Peggy.

18:25.319 --> 18:26.908
And the country club

18:26.909 --> 18:29.118
and those people. Just...

18:29.119 --> 18:31.698
Well, those people... they're your people.

18:31.699 --> 18:34.118
They are not my people.

18:35.319 --> 18:36.408
They're daddy's people.

18:36.409 --> 18:38.448
They're your people now, mister.

18:38.449 --> 18:41.988
Well, I gotta beat Coleman
somehow, right?

18:41.989 --> 18:43.589
Yeah, I have a very different World view

18:43.590 --> 18:44.658
from most of those people.

18:44.659 --> 18:47.159
That's true.

18:48.119 --> 18:49.519
Does seem like every woman in there

18:49.520 --> 18:51.400
would probably make a
better politician's wife

18:51.401 --> 18:52.988
than I do.

18:52.989 --> 18:54.488
Honey, look,

18:54.489 --> 18:57.568
let... Let me tell you something now.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.437
I didn't marry you

18:59.438 --> 19:01.118
because you'd be a good politician's wife.

19:01.119 --> 19:04.198
Why did you marry me?

19:04.199 --> 19:06.158
Because...

19:06.159 --> 19:08.198
Well, because, honestly, you...

19:08.199 --> 19:10.119
You dazzle me.

19:11.279 --> 19:13.239
And you always have.

19:22.069 --> 19:23.778
I love you.

19:23.779 --> 19:27.119
You're gonna be great tomorrow night.

19:35.569 --> 19:37.068
Hey, baby.

19:37.069 --> 19:39.198
Look, honey, I know you're upset.

19:39.199 --> 19:40.999
But, honey, everything's
gonna be just fine.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.988
But look, you got a big
ol' interview tomorrow

19:42.989 --> 19:45.908
and you gotta eat something.
I'm not hungry.

19:45.909 --> 19:48.198
It's pink macaroni.
It's your favorite.

19:48.199 --> 19:50.488
You know, I made it
just... Just like you like it,

19:50.489 --> 19:51.738
with the ketchup

19:51.739 --> 19:55.698
and the big ol' dollop
of cream cheese and...

19:55.699 --> 19:59.028
I don't eat that crap.
You might, but I don't.

19:59.029 --> 20:03.029
You know what? I am just
tryin' to help here.

20:04.239 --> 20:05.858
I'm...

20:05.859 --> 20:09.198
by what, pretending to be a good mother?

20:10.569 --> 20:13.488
Like I'd buy that for a second?

20:13.489 --> 20:15.609
Like I don't see you pawing
everything in This place

20:15.610 --> 20:17.290
looking for what you can get your hands on

20:17.291 --> 20:19.908
to sell for drugs?

20:22.699 --> 20:24.118
What are you... What's in this?

20:24.119 --> 20:25.639
Give me that. No. What are you hiding?

20:25.640 --> 20:26.658
Give it...

20:26.659 --> 20:27.858
what are you hiding?!

20:27.859 --> 20:31.238
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

20:31.239 --> 20:32.908
What's in here,

20:41.699 --> 20:43.989
Are you happy now?!

21:19.564 --> 21:20.813
Hi.

21:20.814 --> 21:23.484
Hi.

21:31.644 --> 21:35.523
On a scale from 1 to 10,

21:35.524 --> 21:39.643
how... awkward is this gonna be at work?

21:39.644 --> 21:42.563
Well... just so you know,

21:42.564 --> 21:45.774
I plan on making it incredibly awkward.

21:47.314 --> 21:50.183
This can just be a onetime thing.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.183
You know, no pressure, no
"what does this mean?"

21:52.184 --> 21:55.353
there's no reason to make this,

21:55.354 --> 21:59.434
more than what it was.

22:02.064 --> 22:04.273
You know, if I didn't have

22:04.274 --> 22:07.563
firsthand proof to the contrary,

22:07.564 --> 22:10.273
I'd accuse you of being a dude.

Okay, the interview will be via satellite

22:58.484 --> 23:00.063
with Robin Roberts...

23:00.064 --> 23:02.983
An exclusive that'll air on
"G.M.A." tomorrow morning.

23:02.984 --> 23:04.983
Now we have a great
relationship with Robin.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.393
She's always fair, but thorough.

23:07.394 --> 23:09.983
Did you get a chance to
check the prep document?

23:09.984 --> 23:12.183
What prep document?

23:12.184 --> 23:14.393
Right. Right.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.983
Okay, So,

23:15.984 --> 23:19.273
she's gonna ask you why
you did this, obviously.

23:19.274 --> 23:20.714
She'll say you have plenty of money.

23:20.715 --> 23:22.063
You don't need to steal.

23:22.064 --> 23:23.904
She'll ask you what kind
of example this sets

23:23.905 --> 23:25.393
for your young fans.

23:25.394 --> 23:27.393
She'll bring up other celebrities

23:27.394 --> 23:30.223
with similar scandals...
Winona, Lindsay...

23:30.224 --> 23:33.813
W... I-I didn't rob Saks, okay?

23:33.814 --> 23:36.353
I don't have three D.U.I.s.

23:36.354 --> 23:38.394
I mean, it's not like I'm
some white-Trash lowlife

23:38.395 --> 23:40.183
who was caught raising roosters

23:40.184 --> 23:41.723
to peck each other's eyes out here.

23:41.724 --> 23:44.433
It was a freakin' bottle of nail polish.

23:44.434 --> 23:45.933
Okay.

23:45.934 --> 23:48.433
What you just did... don't do that.

23:48.434 --> 23:50.433
I can't defend myself.

23:50.434 --> 23:52.103
No. It'll just make things worse.

23:52.104 --> 23:54.313
You have an image to protect.

23:54.314 --> 23:56.683
Your brand depends on this.

23:56.684 --> 23:59.523
You spent a lot of time
hiding where you came from.

23:59.524 --> 24:03.313
The last thing you want
is to expose it now.

24:03.314 --> 24:04.983
Just stay on message.

24:04.984 --> 24:06.563
I got it.

24:06.564 --> 24:07.983
Just be honest, okay?

24:07.984 --> 24:09.264
Take responsibility for every...

24:09.265 --> 24:10.773
I said I got it.

24:10.774 --> 24:13.484
I'll just be honest.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.143
What's going on, Scar?

24:21.144 --> 24:23.143
I don't know what I'm doing here.

24:23.144 --> 24:24.624
You mean hanging out with your uncle?

24:24.625 --> 24:25.465
Kind of embarrassing?

24:26.724 --> 24:29.183
Not "here" here.

24:29.184 --> 24:31.103
Nashville here.

24:31.104 --> 24:32.523
I came out here to be with Avery...

24:32.524 --> 24:35.353
Support him, have a life with him.

24:35.354 --> 24:38.143
He has been scuffling so hard for so long,

24:38.144 --> 24:42.353
and Gunnar and I get this deal
without even half trying.

24:42.354 --> 24:45.933
I think Gunnar's been trying
for a little while, so...

24:45.934 --> 24:49.774
I get this deal without even half trying.

24:50.934 --> 24:52.103
That's even worse.

24:52.104 --> 24:53.393
Well, look...

24:53.394 --> 24:56.483
I'm no expert at giving advice, but...

24:56.484 --> 24:58.433
people grow.

24:58.434 --> 25:01.223
Not always at the same rate.

25:01.224 --> 25:03.313
I can tell you it's not easy being the one

25:03.314 --> 25:05.103
who's always struggling to catch up.

25:05.104 --> 25:09.104
But, scar, there's not much you
can do about that, sweetie.

25:09.524 --> 25:12.433
Avery's either gonna keep up or...

25:12.434 --> 25:14.724
he's gonna get left behind. That's it.

25:27.854 --> 25:29.063
Do you have a cigarette?

25:29.064 --> 25:30.063
You don't smoke.

25:30.064 --> 25:32.643
I know. I just want to hold it.

25:32.644 --> 25:34.273
Where the hell is Deacon?

25:34.274 --> 25:36.063
I-I texted him. He'll be here.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.353
You know he refuses to text.

25:40.354 --> 25:41.893
Are you nervous?

25:41.894 --> 25:44.483
Yeah, I think I'm a little bit nervous.

25:44.484 --> 25:47.683
You know... being back
here at the country club,

25:47.684 --> 25:49.021
all that, you know, just...

25:49.022 --> 25:51.182
Rayna, these are your people.
They're gonna love you.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.143
These are not my people.

25:52.144 --> 25:54.011
Why does everybody keep
saying these are my people?

25:54.012 --> 25:54.972
These are not my people.

25:54.973 --> 25:55.773
These are the people

25:55.774 --> 25:57.094
who made fun of me in high school

25:57.095 --> 25:58.723
for liking country music.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.044
Well, everyone has graduated,
and now you are a big star.

26:01.045 --> 26:03.983
So, hey, enjoy the last laugh.

26:03.984 --> 26:06.933
Will you please just go find
me a cigarette to hold?

26:06.934 --> 26:08.103
Yes, I can.

26:08.104 --> 26:10.394
Thank you.

26:16.018 --> 26:17.851
Thank you so much for joining us.

26:17.852 --> 26:19.101
We know you're a busy woman,

26:19.102 --> 26:20.941
preparing for your upcoming tour.

26:20.942 --> 26:23.771
Well, thank you very much
for having me, Robin.

26:23.772 --> 26:27.271
A lot's been swirling around
in the media, on the internet,

26:27.272 --> 26:29.651
and we wanted to give you a chance

26:29.652 --> 26:31.391
to set the record straight.

26:31.392 --> 26:33.061
I appreciate that.

26:33.062 --> 26:36.481
We've obviously seen this
before with other celebrities.

26:36.482 --> 26:39.061
Most recently, Lindsay lohan.

26:39.062 --> 26:41.191
Before that, Winona Ryder.

26:41.192 --> 26:43.311
Even Farrah Fawcett back in the day.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.151
Like them, you are obviously

26:45.152 --> 26:48.271
a person with success, with money.

26:48.272 --> 26:49.942
How do you explain this video?

26:52.652 --> 26:54.271
Actually,

26:54.272 --> 26:56.601
there's a very simple explanation for it.

26:56.602 --> 26:59.351
Everybody wants to be

26:59.352 --> 27:02.351
young and famous and rich,

27:02.352 --> 27:06.352
and I am, and people are very jealous.

27:06.982 --> 27:08.151
Wait a minute.

27:08.152 --> 27:10.311
So you're maintaining
you did nothing wrong?

27:10.312 --> 27:12.650
I put the nail polish in my purse

27:12.651 --> 27:14.771
because I didn't want it to
fall through the basket,

27:14.772 --> 27:16.771
and then I didn't get a
chance to pay for it

27:16.772 --> 27:18.601
because I was very distracted,

27:18.602 --> 27:20.300
because as usual,

27:20.301 --> 27:22.101
it's very difficult for
me to leave my house

27:22.102 --> 27:26.231
without being followed or, harassed.

27:26.232 --> 27:29.981
And, that's the problem
with being on top...

27:29.982 --> 27:32.062
is that people aren't just
waiting for you to fall.

27:32.063 --> 27:34.102
They're trying to cause you to.

27:36.352 --> 27:38.981
I imagine the scandal has been hard on you

27:38.982 --> 27:40.152
and your mother.

27:42.892 --> 27:44.481
Sorry?

27:44.482 --> 27:48.691
Is it true she was arrested for
possession of drugs and was...

27:48.692 --> 27:49.982
This interview's over.

28:13.097 --> 28:14.766
Sorry I'm late.

28:14.767 --> 28:15.926
All right, great.

28:15.927 --> 28:17.636
Y'all, can y'all please clear out?

28:17.637 --> 28:18.886
Thank you, Emily.

28:18.887 --> 28:21.266
Did you not get my text? I don't do texts.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.136
So finally you decided to
grace us with your presence.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.266
How you doin', Lamar? Good to see you.

28:26.267 --> 28:28.267
No, no, no, just take your time.
There's no rush.

28:28.268 --> 28:30.388
All right. Come on, Lamar.
Let's let them get ready.

28:30.389 --> 28:32.726
I guess we can still count
on you bein' underdressed.

28:32.727 --> 28:34.846
I mean, hell, it's only $1,400 a ticket.

28:34.847 --> 28:38.806
So there's no need for you to
look presentable or anything.

28:38.807 --> 28:40.887
You know what? I'm only
doing this for Rayna, okay?

28:40.888 --> 28:43.556
It's called a favor.

28:43.557 --> 28:46.105
Why would you begrudge
one tiny little favor

28:46.106 --> 28:48.426
for a family that's carried
you on its back for 20 years?

28:48.427 --> 28:49.925
Carried me?

28:49.926 --> 28:51.806
I think you got me confused
with someone else.

28:51.807 --> 28:52.767
I'm gonna do this thing,

28:52.768 --> 28:54.265
but I'm not gonna kiss your
ass while I'm doing it.

28:54.266 --> 28:54.783
That's his job.

28:54.784 --> 28:55.664
What the hell, Deacon?

28:55.665 --> 28:56.874
I didn't even ask you to do this.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.235
We have a show to do. Someone did.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.664
You think I want you to be
here right now? Please.

28:59.665 --> 29:01.115
Because I'm not gonna stand
here and be insulted.

29:01.116 --> 29:02.768
No, but you'll sure as hell
stand by and watch... come on.

29:02.769 --> 29:03.986
While somebody else insults me.

29:03.987 --> 29:04.964
Deacon. I'm here to help you.

29:04.965 --> 29:06.174
Hell, I'm not even voting for you.

29:06.175 --> 29:07.575
Well, damn. There goes my campaign.

29:07.576 --> 29:09.004
Hey, guys, we got a show
starting right about now.

29:09.005 --> 29:09.615
Yeah, what campaign?

29:09.616 --> 29:11.445
This whole town knows you're
nothing but a straw man for him.

29:11.446 --> 29:13.926
What you know about politics
couldn't even fill a shot glass.

29:13.927 --> 29:15.873
Shut up! Shut up! I know a
prize pig when I see it.

29:15.874 --> 29:17.674
Shut up! Are you drinking again?
Is that it?

29:17.675 --> 29:18.395
Please. Teddy boy?

29:18.396 --> 29:20.236
Teddy, Teddy. Can we
just get this over with?

29:33.276 --> 29:34.716
The tease for the "G.M.A." Interview

29:34.717 --> 29:36.445
is already all over the internet.

29:36.446 --> 29:38.575
Walkout included?
Walkout included.

29:38.576 --> 29:40.405
God.
I gotta take this.

29:40.406 --> 29:41.945
Y-Yeah...

29:41.946 --> 29:44.195
They're even promoting
it on Kimmel tonight.

29:44.196 --> 29:45.716
When the label sees this, we're toast.

29:45.717 --> 29:48.276
No, I understand.

29:50.406 --> 29:52.485
How bad?

29:52.486 --> 29:54.766
Performance international's
just pulled out of the tour.

29:54.767 --> 29:58.326
Sponsors are bailing.
they don't have any choice.

29:59.736 --> 30:00.985
What does that mean?

30:00.986 --> 30:03.775
It means that your tour, for now,

30:03.776 --> 30:05.076
it's off.

30:13.486 --> 30:15.945
Hello!

30:15.946 --> 30:19.405
Welcome, everybody. Welcome.

30:19.406 --> 30:21.606
I hope y'all are having a
good time, 'cause I sure am.

30:25.023 --> 30:27.062
You know, I look out here,

30:27.063 --> 30:29.522
and I see so many familiar faces.

30:29.523 --> 30:32.102
We are all...

30:32.103 --> 30:34.102
one family in this town,

30:34.103 --> 30:37.272
which makes this evening
especially meaningful.

30:37.273 --> 30:39.642
I-I'm so appreciative

30:39.643 --> 30:43.602
of y'all coming out to
support one of our own

30:43.603 --> 30:45.102
and a man

30:45.103 --> 30:47.352
who I am proud to have as my son-in-law...

30:47.353 --> 30:50.142
The next mayor of Nashville...

30:50.143 --> 30:52.142
Mr. Teddy Conrad.

31:02.233 --> 31:05.272
And, folks, continuing
in the family tradition,

31:05.273 --> 31:07.182
it's also my privilege

31:07.183 --> 31:09.852
to introduce the other
superstar in my family...

I don't even know what
that Teddy stuff was.

33:55.361 --> 33:57.400
You don't know what that was? No.

33:57.401 --> 33:59.810
Seemed to me like it was
you taking the bait.

34:02.811 --> 34:05.060
I don't know what you were thinking.

34:05.061 --> 34:07.730
Shoot, you're not only self-destructive,

34:07.731 --> 34:09.600
you're just destructive.

34:11.690 --> 34:14.020
I can't believe you put
us in this position.

34:14.021 --> 34:16.860
Which "us," Ray?

34:19.101 --> 34:20.771
Which us?

34:27.061 --> 34:28.940
I thought you needed me.

34:30.940 --> 34:34.150
I do need you.

34:36.271 --> 34:39.060
I don't even know what
to do with that anymore.

34:39.061 --> 34:42.150
Well, I don't know what to do either.

34:52.101 --> 34:55.521
But now I'm gonna have to go home.

34:57.941 --> 34:59.601
We done here?

35:06.401 --> 35:08.021
Yeah, we're done.

35:47.691 --> 35:50.061
I can't deal with it anymore.

35:51.981 --> 35:53.770
I know.

35:53.771 --> 35:56.810
I'm your husband.

35:56.811 --> 36:00.021
I'm firing him.

36:16.981 --> 36:18.440
Hey.

36:18.441 --> 36:20.021
Hey.

36:26.144 --> 36:27.933
I know you don't want to talk about this,

36:27.934 --> 36:29.310
but,

36:29.311 --> 36:31.809
how long are we not gonna talk about it?

36:31.810 --> 36:34.139
'cause I think we need to.

36:38.770 --> 36:42.770
I don't want to feel bad
about this deal, Avery.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.639
I really want to do this.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.309
I wanna write.

36:49.310 --> 36:53.310
And I'd love it if you could
support me like I support you.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.849
I'm trying.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.100
Okay?

37:02.310 --> 37:03.730
Okay.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.769
I hope this isn't awkward,

37:29.770 --> 37:32.809
but that's all my yogurt, not yours.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.139
Really?

37:34.140 --> 37:38.140
'Cause someone wrote my name
on every single one of them.

37:40.350 --> 37:41.519
Weird.

Thanks for coming.

38:20.401 --> 38:22.382
This is torture.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.292
At the club last night, I-I felt sick.

38:25.293 --> 38:26.502
I know.

38:26.503 --> 38:29.842
I'm really sorry about that.

38:29.843 --> 38:32.752
This... This campaign...
It changes everything.

38:32.753 --> 38:34.753
I mean, they've really
been digging into my past.

38:34.754 --> 38:36.212
Teddy, someone's gonna find out.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.002
It's only a matter of time.

38:38.003 --> 38:40.752
Okay, well, that's what
I'm hoping to avoid.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.542
You haven't told anybody, have you?

38:42.543 --> 38:46.632
No. I haven't breathed a
word of this to anyone.

38:46.633 --> 38:49.342
Teddy, we've kept this secret a long time,

38:49.343 --> 38:53.252
but maybe it's better if we come
clean now, on our own terms.

38:53.253 --> 38:55.502
Peggy, look, what we
did was really stupid,

38:55.503 --> 38:58.342
but you cannot...

38:58.343 --> 39:00.132
You cannot say a word to anyone.

39:00.133 --> 39:03.082
My campaign, my marriage, my
entire family depends on it,

39:03.083 --> 39:05.633
and yours, too.

39:17.793 --> 39:19.292
Hey.

39:19.293 --> 39:20.962
Hey.

39:20.963 --> 39:22.633
We need to talk.

39:31.423 --> 39:33.923
I don't think this is working...
you and me.

39:38.583 --> 39:41.672
Are you dropping me?

39:41.673 --> 39:45.673
My job is to give you
the best advice I can.

39:45.843 --> 39:48.342
Whatever problems you had before...

39:48.343 --> 39:50.792
That interview made them
exponentially worse.

39:50.793 --> 39:52.383
I know.

39:53.753 --> 39:55.213
I know.

40:03.633 --> 40:05.923
Please don't do this.

40:07.383 --> 40:09.292
I want my tour back,

40:09.293 --> 40:11.462
I want my image restored,

40:11.463 --> 40:15.503
and I will do whatever it takes.

40:17.133 --> 40:19.922
And I'll listen to you.

40:19.923 --> 40:21.583
I promise.

40:24.673 --> 40:27.082
I-I need to ask you a question.

40:27.083 --> 40:30.753
And if you want me to stay,
I need an honest answer.

40:32.923 --> 40:35.712
Why'd you do it?

40:35.713 --> 40:37.712
Why'd you take the nail polish?

40:37.713 --> 40:41.382
It's something I used
to do when I was a kid.

40:41.383 --> 40:45.712
And it may sound funny to you, but...

40:45.713 --> 40:49.713
it made me feel like I
could take care of myself

40:51.793 --> 40:53.963
when nobody else would.

40:57.963 --> 40:59.423
Okay.

41:01.843 --> 41:05.632
From now on, you listen.

41:05.633 --> 41:07.342
You listen to every word I say.

41:07.343 --> 41:09.173
Yeah.

41:11.043 --> 41:14.082
All right, tomorrow morning, we regroup.

41:14.083 --> 41:16.672
Look, don't just sit here all alone.
Call a friend.

41:16.673 --> 41:19.342
Try to get your mind off this
stuff a little bit, okay?

41:19.343 --> 41:22.752
I don't have friends.

41:22.753 --> 41:24.713
I have people who want to be seen with me.

41:26.583 --> 41:28.542
Well...

41:28.543 --> 41:30.542
used to.

41:30.543 --> 41:33.173
All right. I'll see you in the morning.

41:54.503 --> 41:56.672
Hello?

41:56.673 --> 41:59.042
Deacon, hey.

41:59.043 --> 42:02.672
It's me.

42:02.673 --> 42:03.792
It's Juliette.

42:03.793 --> 42:07.213
I know who "me" is, Juliette.

42:09.503 --> 42:12.173
I hate to call you like this.
I just,

42:13.673 --> 42:14.753
It's okay.

42:16.133 --> 42:19.752
You all right?

42:19.753 --> 42:22.422
Not really.

42:22.423 --> 42:24.793
Hey. You doing anything right now?
