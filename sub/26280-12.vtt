WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.090
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.133 --> 00:05.048
So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.

00:05.092 --> 00:06.658
This is our wedding,
and if anyone's gonna

00:06.702 --> 00:11.011
design the floral arrangements,
it's going to be my man.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.056
Thank you.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.406
I mean, I-I'm not trying
to be a Groomzilla,

00:15.450 --> 00:18.061
but... this is my specialty.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.151
[phone chimes]

00:21.195 --> 00:22.283
Everything okay?

00:22.326 --> 00:24.067
Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.503
I helped her install it.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.244
You can't look at it.
That's spying.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.724
Who the hell is this guy?

00:28.767 --> 00:29.942
Ooh, let me see.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.642
So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?

00:33.685 --> 00:35.513
Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.950
And you need to delete
that app from your phone.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.474
Because you're hiding
something from me?

00:39.517 --> 00:41.128
No, because you
should trust me!

00:41.171 --> 00:44.044
How can I trust you?!
I barely even know you!

00:44.087 --> 00:45.958
Then what are we doing?

00:46.002 --> 00:47.525
I don't know.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.181
Oh!DENISE: Aah,

00:51.225 --> 00:53.227
sad man!

00:55.142 --> 00:56.795
This is so great.

00:56.839 --> 00:58.101
Why don't we do it
more often?

00:58.145 --> 01:00.103
Because you have two kids,

01:00.147 --> 01:01.365
I have Sheldon,

01:01.409 --> 01:03.193
and Penny's apparently
in the gym all the time,

01:03.237 --> 01:05.108
'cause damn, look at her!

01:06.327 --> 01:08.024
Yeah, so impressive
how you manage

01:08.068 --> 01:10.374
to bounce back
after having no babies.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.204
Ah, another reason why
we don't do this more often.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.729
You've come
to a giant metal door.

01:17.773 --> 01:21.124
I check the door
for traps.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.126
There are no traps.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.345
I use my wizard eye

01:24.388 --> 01:26.869
to see what's on the
other side of the door.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.393
Hey, that's sort of like how
you used a doorbell camera

01:29.437 --> 01:32.092
to spy on your fiancée.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.269
No, it's nothing like that.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.227
Your wizard eye
reveals a monster.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.664
Oh. Is it alone and unloved?I guess.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.754
I open the door and say,
"Hey, Raj."

01:44.147 --> 01:46.106
I have a bottle
of champagne for you.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.542
Oh, we didn't order this.

01:47.585 --> 01:50.153
It's from the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.634
Oh. Well, if we drink it,
does that mean

01:52.677 --> 01:54.114
we're making a promise?

01:54.157 --> 01:57.334
'Cause I am happily married,
although I will watch.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.685
We're not gonna do anything.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.427
Really?
So all that work's for Leonard?

02:05.429 --> 02:07.257
Why don't you just
call her? I'm sure

02:07.301 --> 02:08.650
you guys can work this out.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.304
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's just play.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.653
Okay, the cyclops tells you

02:11.696 --> 02:13.350
that the enchantress
you seek is staying

02:13.394 --> 02:15.178
at the Inn of the Dwarven Lords.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.224
Really? An inn?

02:17.267 --> 02:19.269
Anu is a concierge at a hotel.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.140
That's a little insensitive,

02:20.183 --> 02:21.663
don't you think?

02:21.706 --> 02:24.318
I hadn't noticed that
before you mentioned it.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.450
Well, now that I've
mentioned it, how do you feel?Bad.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.148
Shame on you.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.324
Hey, ladies.Zack!

02:30.367 --> 02:31.803
Hi. You guys
know Zack.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.109
BERNADETTE:
Yeah.Of course.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.589
Did-did you
send this over?

02:34.632 --> 02:37.287
I did. I asked for the
most expensive one they have.

02:37.331 --> 02:38.680
They said it was $200,

02:38.723 --> 02:41.073
and I said
I want a moreexpensive one.

02:41.117 --> 02:44.338
And then, they said it was $300.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.298
But it-it was the same...

02:48.342 --> 02:50.474
Don't.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.695
Thank you, but you shouldn't
have spent so much.Nah.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.959
It's cool. I sold my company
for a boatload of money.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.352
And then I bought a boat.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.050
Then I got married.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.443
Guess where.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.140
On your boat?

03:04.184 --> 03:07.317
No, but that would've
been awesome!

03:08.362 --> 03:10.799
Well, congratulations.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.366
Hey, you and Leonard

03:12.409 --> 03:15.151
should come over and have
dinner with us on our boat.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.719
Yeah, that would be so nice.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.548
Leonard was just saying
how he was hoping to have dinner

03:20.591 --> 03:23.333
with one of your ex-boyfriends
on his expensive boat.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.032
Well, then this worked out
perfect!

03:27.076 --> 03:28.469

Hey. How was game night?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.586
Oh, off the charts.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.501
Literally.
Sheldon rolled a number so high,

04:00.544 --> 04:02.503
it wasn't on any
of these charts.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.069
[laughs] That's funny.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.984
Wow. I should not have
driven home.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.510
How was ladies' night?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.947
It was fun. Amy got drunk
and kept telling us

04:11.990 --> 04:15.820
that Sheldon's chest is smooth
like a porpoise.

04:15.864 --> 04:19.041
Well, it does squeak
when you touch it.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.869
And we ran into Zack.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.958
Oh. Yeah? How's he doing?

04:23.001 --> 04:25.439
He got married.Oh. Well, that's nice.

04:25.482 --> 04:28.746
Yeah, and he sold his company
for a fortune and retired.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.792
Huh.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.536
And you ended up with me,
so everybody wins.

04:35.579 --> 04:38.495
Wait. You're not
jealous of Zack, are you?

04:38.539 --> 04:40.454
What? Oh, absolutely not.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.891
In fact, he should be jealous
of me because I have you.Oh.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.981
And a dungeon with over 30 rooms
left unexplored

04:46.024 --> 04:47.939
because no one thought
to search for secret doors

04:47.983 --> 04:50.072
under the wizard's throne.

04:50.115 --> 04:53.031
Oh. You know, I'd
like to go exploring.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.469
Really?Mm-hmm.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.035
Well, I'll get the dice
back out.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.693
[phone chimes]

05:07.350 --> 05:09.961
Go away, Raj!

05:13.138 --> 05:15.358
What are you doing?

05:15.402 --> 05:18.143
I'm winning you back
Love Actuallystyle.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.412
I don't know what that means.

05:25.455 --> 05:28.371
Really? You've never
seen Love Actually?

05:28.415 --> 05:31.896
If you want to watch it
right now, I'll just wait.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.378
I have nothing to say to you.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.293
Look, we both made mistakes.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.252
I am so sorry that
I spied on you.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.168
I didn't mean to, but
I know it was not okay.

05:44.605 --> 05:47.564
Now, do you want
to apologize to me?

05:47.608 --> 05:51.612
You also said you don't trust me
and that you barely know me.

05:51.655 --> 05:55.137
I really thought this would be
more of a back-and-forth thing.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.662
Honestly, Raj, why do you even
want to marry me?

05:58.706 --> 06:02.449
You know, family
and India and stuff.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.146
Here's what I think.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.974
All of your friends are married,

06:06.017 --> 06:08.019
and you don't want
to be left behind.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.544
And honestly, that's not
a good enough reason.

06:10.587 --> 06:14.286
Uh, okay, well, how
is that different

06:14.330 --> 06:16.288
than what you're doing? Hmm?

06:16.332 --> 06:17.681
Worried that you wasted

06:17.725 --> 06:20.423
so many years dating the
wrong people, and now,

06:20.467 --> 06:22.469
you're just looking
for a shortcut.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.168
You're right.
It's not different.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.169
Okay, so we agree.

06:27.212 --> 06:29.258
Yeah.
Great.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.042
Wait. What did we
just agree on?

06:31.086 --> 06:34.916
That we shouldn't
see each other anymore.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.005
You know what?

06:37.048 --> 06:40.051
Why don't you shut the door,
and I'll just do the cards?

06:48.756 --> 06:51.498
Uh, do you remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack?

06:51.541 --> 06:54.414
Leonard, I remember all
of Penny's ex-boyfriends.

06:54.457 --> 06:57.025
If you'd like, I could
list them alphabetically.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.809
No, thank you.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.071
Fun fact.
You would think

07:00.115 --> 07:02.030
Zack would be
the last one on the list,

07:02.073 --> 07:05.599
but she also dated two Zekes.

07:05.642 --> 07:08.166
Well, apparently,
Zack sold his company

07:08.210 --> 07:10.038
for a ton of money and retired.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.561
And that bothers you?

07:11.605 --> 07:14.172
I don't know. I mean...

07:14.216 --> 07:15.652
I guess so. Yeah.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.175
It doesn't seem fair.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.221
I work hard.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.834
I'm really smart.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.753
I've made substantial
contributions to my field.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.236
But Zack gets to be rich,

07:34.279 --> 07:36.630
while I'm still working
for a paycheck?

07:36.673 --> 07:39.067
Well, a lot of people
you don't know are rich.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.417
That doesn't seem to bother you.
Mark Zuckerberg,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.419
Sultan of Brunei,
Gordon Letwin.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.509
Who's that?He's one of the first
11 employees of Microsoft.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.119
Yeah, well, I don't

07:48.163 --> 07:50.774
have to hang out
with Gordon Letwin.Well, that's too bad.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.298
He helped create
the HPFS file system.

07:53.342 --> 07:55.953
Oh, the stories he could tell.

07:55.997 --> 07:59.087
Penny told him we'd go have
dinner with him and his wife

07:59.130 --> 08:00.654
on their stupid boat.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.133
Well, just tell her
you don't want to go.

08:02.177 --> 08:05.615
Well, then, she'll think
I'm being jealous and petty.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.226
So you want to seem
mature and confident.

08:13.797 --> 08:17.105
I make one mistake, and she says
she doesn't want to marry me.

08:17.148 --> 08:19.542
Like she never
screwed up.Did she?

08:19.586 --> 08:22.676
Well, she agreed to marry me.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.460
Honestly,

08:24.504 --> 08:25.853
I think you dodged a bullet.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.550
I don't think
she was right for you.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.899
Howie, shh.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.031
What?

08:30.074 --> 08:31.075
You can't bad-mouth Anu.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.337
They're gonna
get back together,

08:32.381 --> 08:34.209
and you're gonna look
like a jerk.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.863
I mean, remember

08:35.906 --> 08:38.300
when we broke up, and Penny said
all those mean things about you?

08:41.521 --> 08:44.219
What did she say?

08:44.262 --> 08:45.481
I don't want to get into it.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.178
Some of it was hurtful,
most of it was true.

08:50.791 --> 08:54.229
So I'm just supposed
to lie to my friend?I don't want you to lie to me.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.578
No one's gonna lie to you.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.667
[whispers]:
Lie.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.756
She says

08:59.800 --> 09:01.018
the only reason I'm marrying her

09:01.062 --> 09:02.280
is because
all my friends are married,

09:02.324 --> 09:03.499
and I don't want
to feel left out.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.328
Oh, that's nonsense.No.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.416
She's right.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.332
[quietly]:
Now what do I say?

09:12.595 --> 09:15.119
So, Marissa, how

09:15.163 --> 09:16.556
did you guys meet?

09:16.599 --> 09:18.688
Oh, it's a pretty
funny story.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.038
We met in a bookstore.

09:24.085 --> 09:26.087
That isfunny.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.351
Yeah, I was just there
using the bathroom,

09:29.394 --> 09:32.136
but this one had a stack
of books, like, this tall.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.877
Oh. So, you really like to read?

09:33.921 --> 09:35.923
Oh, no. I work there.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.926
Yeah, she is super smart.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.145
Seriously, you name,
like, any book,

09:41.189 --> 09:43.017
she'll tell you if
she's heard of it.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.801
Go on, try her.

09:44.845 --> 09:45.846
Oh, uh, well, uh...

09:45.889 --> 09:47.108
Catcher in the Rye.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.065
Nope.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.154
ZACK:
Look at that, Penny.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.679
I guess we both like nerds.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.770
So, uh, we gonna
take this thing out?

09:56.813 --> 09:59.599
Nah. It's a little
choppy tonight.

09:59.642 --> 10:02.210
Yeah, that's okay-- this is
nice, sitting under the stars.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.951
It's actually kind of peaceful.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.257
Well, it's a beautiful boat.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.476
Thanks, man.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.782
We love it.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.827
Although, he's so tall
he bangs his head

10:10.871 --> 10:12.481
almost every time
he goes downstairs.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.179
After the first couple,
you don't even feel it.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.181
Where are our manners?

10:17.225 --> 10:19.009
Zack, let's get our guests
something to drink.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.707
Oh, you got it, babe.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.709
[quietly]:
I can't believe
that guy's rich.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.014
MARISSA:
Ooh, watch your head.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.320
ZACK:
That was a close one.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.672
Are you jealous?I know, I know,
I shouldn't be.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.892
He's super sweet.
I should be happy for them.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.633
Oh, it's driving
me crazy, too.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.678
Really?Yes. I was trying
to pretend

10:35.722 --> 10:37.375
like it wasn't so you
wouldn't think I was petty.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.074
Wha-- turns out
we're both petty.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.424
I love you so much.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.078
Aw.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.383
Cheers, guys.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.081
Aw, thanks.Thank you.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.648
[laughs]

10:48.691 --> 10:51.912
So listen, I got
to be honest.

10:51.955 --> 10:55.785
We sort of have another reason
for asking you here.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.396
We want to have a baby,

10:58.440 --> 11:01.443
but we can't do it
on our own.
It could be

11:01.486 --> 11:03.750
because of the game me and
my frat brothers used to play

11:03.793 --> 11:06.404
where we kicked each other
in the balls over and over.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.799
But the doc says
there's no telling.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.716
We just don't know.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.892
Huh.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.634
You went to college.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.289
And Zack's
always admired you

11:21.332 --> 11:23.726
because you're
the smartest person he knows.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.293
Okay, whoa, whoa.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.252
Whoa, whoa. You know, this
has been such a nice evening.

11:28.296 --> 11:31.081
Let's all just stop before
anyone says any more things.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.650
Leonard, would you be
the father of our baby?Aw, you said a thing.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.791
Wow, this is
really flattering.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.924
And also really weird, right?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.491
ZACK:
Oh, just to be clear,

11:49.534 --> 11:52.537
you don't get to...
you know.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.975
No, I...

11:55.018 --> 11:56.759
I got it.Just because I slept

11:56.803 --> 11:59.893
with your wife doesn't mean
you get to sleep with mine.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.026
We... we get it,

12:03.070 --> 12:06.769
but... thank you
for saying it out loud.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.162
You're welcome.

12:09.511 --> 12:12.688
I know it's a big ask,
but it would mean so much to us.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.907
ZACK:
Yeah, and we

12:13.950 --> 12:15.996
really don't want
a stranger's, you know...

12:16.039 --> 12:18.999
I know....sperm.

12:19.042 --> 12:22.306
And Zack's always talked about
what a great guy Leonard is.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.134
I...

12:24.178 --> 12:26.876
[chuckles]: I really
don't know what to say.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.096
Really? You don't know
what to say?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.925
You know, I-I think we
should talk about this.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.101
Oh, yeah. Definitely,
you guys should talk, yeah.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.146
Take your time.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.891
He means privately.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.023
Right. Sorry.Sure. Yep.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.894
Come on, Zack.Okay. Yeah.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.722
Okay.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.463
You really think
those two should be parents?

12:48.506 --> 12:50.117
There's nothing
wrong with them.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.249
[loud thump]ZACK: Ow!

12:55.513 --> 12:57.994
[computer chiming]

12:59.648 --> 13:01.606
Hello, Daddy.

13:01.650 --> 13:05.001
Did you install a camera
to spy on your fiancée?

13:05.045 --> 13:06.263
What?!

13:06.307 --> 13:08.483
No!

13:08.526 --> 13:10.006
That's what her parents told me

13:10.050 --> 13:12.095
when they said they
were calling off the wedding.

13:12.139 --> 13:15.185
But I told them you would never
do such a thing.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.186
Thank you.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.798
I mean, I did install a camera

13:18.841 --> 13:22.453
and I did spy on her, but I did
not install it tospy on her.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.108
Well, that's not going
to be ourstory.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.632
Our story is that she's a liar.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.069
And-and old.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.854
An old, dirty liar.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.508
Oh, no.
She's-she's actually great.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.466
I'm the one who screwed up.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.164
Well, don't say that to them.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.035
She's bad. You're good.

13:39.079 --> 13:42.430
They have to pay me back
for my wedding deposits.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.171
[sighs]
This is all my fault.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.260
I should have...
I should have just trusted her.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.697
So you're saying
you still want to get married?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.699
Fine. Then I'll call her parents

13:50.742 --> 13:52.744
and we'll straighten
this whole thing out.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.572
I don't think
she wants to marry me.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.965
And honestly...

13:56.009 --> 13:58.402
she deserves someone better.

13:58.446 --> 14:02.058
[sighs] Rajesh, you need to stop
being so hard on yourself.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.191
You're a good man.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.627
[chuckles]:
Wow.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.890
Y-You've never told me that.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.153
You're also a dope.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.069
That you've said.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.071
But your heart's
in the right place,

14:15.115 --> 14:16.681
and you deserve happiness.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.510
So you just need to figure out
what you want,

14:19.554 --> 14:22.862
and if that means cancelling the
wedding, we cancel the wedding.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.472
Thank you.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.561
But figure it out quickly,
or I'll be celebrating

14:26.604 --> 14:28.563
my next birthday
with a lot more elephants

14:28.606 --> 14:30.870
and marigolds than I expected.

14:33.611 --> 14:36.658
And Leonard just stood
there with a big, dumb
smile on his face,

14:36.701 --> 14:39.704
like he was watching a puppy
and a monkey make friends.

14:41.054 --> 14:43.926
Well, I can see how he'd
be flattered to be asked.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.536
It's not flattering.
It's creepy.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.235
Well, something can be both
flattering andcreepy.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.846
You know, just the other night,
Sheldon said that my feet

14:50.890 --> 14:53.022
looked like
Richard Feynman's hands.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.719
Really? So
you'd be okay

14:54.763 --> 14:57.766
if someone wanted to use Sheldon
as their sperm donor?

14:57.809 --> 15:00.900
Oh, absolutely not. I am
the only handmaid in this tale.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.861
So Leonard's
really considering this?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.297
Yes. We got in a
huge fight about it.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.212
He said, well, if I
don't want to have his baby,

15:09.256 --> 15:11.388
then why shouldn't someone else
be able to? Do you believe that?

15:14.870 --> 15:16.219
What?

15:16.263 --> 15:19.266
Well, there is
a deep-seated biological drive

15:19.309 --> 15:20.876
to pass on your genes.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.486
It's only natural.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.184
So you're on his side?

15:24.227 --> 15:26.142
Well, viewing
Leonard as a mammal,

15:26.186 --> 15:28.405
it's perfectly
understandable.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.278
But viewing him
as your husband, he stinks.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.454
And we hate him.

15:36.022 --> 15:39.242
[video game weapons firing]Really? Zack
wanted you to donate

15:39.286 --> 15:41.592
your genetic material
for his baby?

15:41.636 --> 15:44.987
Yeah. So I'd be helping out a
couple who really want a baby,

15:45.031 --> 15:48.121
and they were gonna pay us,
and Penny freaked out about it.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.949
That doesn't make
any sense.
I know.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.038
They wanted you?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.865
[video game tires screeching,
car crashing]

15:53.909 --> 15:55.737
Yes, Sheldon,
they wanted me.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.392
I'm smart. I'm nice.I'm smart. I'm nice.

15:58.435 --> 16:02.265
And I can eat cheese
without clearing out a room.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.485
Are you upset he
didn't ask you?

16:04.528 --> 16:06.704
Of course not. I just
think it's interesting

16:06.748 --> 16:09.838
that of all the people
he knows, he thinks
you're the best choice.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.840
Well, he does.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.364
I don't see why Penny
is so against this.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.627
Well, perhaps Penny's worried
that you haven't considered

16:16.671 --> 16:19.326
the emotional toll of knowing
there's a child out there

16:19.369 --> 16:21.763
who is biologically yours
but not actually yours.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.331
[video game tires screech]

16:24.374 --> 16:26.637
Wow, that's
really insightful.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.857
Yeah, I'm taller than you
and I don't have asthma.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.380
Those people are crazy.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.601
[phone chimes]

16:37.561 --> 16:40.260
Come on, I know you're there,
and I know you know it's me.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.480
[groans]

16:45.395 --> 16:48.094
You're just making this harder.Look...

16:48.137 --> 16:49.834
you were right.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.315
I was doing this for
the wrong reasons.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.101
You deserve to marry
someone who knows

16:55.144 --> 16:57.886
how amazing you are...
and who proposes

16:57.929 --> 17:01.455
because he doesn't want to spend
a single day without you.

17:01.498 --> 17:05.372
Not... not because he wants
to catch up to his friends.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.548
Thank you.

17:07.591 --> 17:12.161
And I want you to know, I
think I could be that man.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.816
Raj, I'm not gonna marry you.

17:14.859 --> 17:17.340
I'm not asking you to.Then why are you here?

17:17.384 --> 17:18.602
Because I like you.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.256
Okay? I like you.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.345
I-I like you enough
to start this relationship

17:22.389 --> 17:25.305
at the beginning,
not in the middle.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.610
So...

17:26.654 --> 17:29.396
will you go out
on a date with me?

17:29.439 --> 17:31.920
[sighs]
I don't know.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.232
Okay.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.929
But I warn you,

17:40.972 --> 17:43.149
I just got out of
a weird relationship,

17:43.192 --> 17:45.760
and I might complain
about my ex a lot.

17:45.803 --> 17:49.720
Maybe he's being weird
because he doesn't know how
to ask for his ring back.

18:00.035 --> 18:00.862
Hey.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.082
Hi.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.605
Where you been?

18:04.648 --> 18:06.520
Just out.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.217
All right, look, um...

18:08.261 --> 18:10.567
I'm sorry that we fought before.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.917
I know this is
a really unusual situation,

18:12.961 --> 18:15.920
and if you don't want me
to do it, I won't.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.661
Really?

18:17.705 --> 18:19.185
Yeah.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.665
We're a team.
We're in this together.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.452
I'll be right back.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.598
What is that?

18:41.642 --> 18:43.687
It's a sample cup.

18:43.731 --> 18:48.170
Really? 'Cause it looks like
the top off the NyQuil bottle.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.434
It's the closest thing
I could find.

18:51.478 --> 18:54.089
It's a gesture. Shut up.All right, sorry.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.615
So... are you saying
you're okay with this?

18:58.659 --> 19:00.139
[sighs]:
I don't know,

19:00.182 --> 19:02.489
but... when I told you
I didn't want to have kids,

19:02.532 --> 19:05.231
you didn't have a say
in that, so...

19:05.274 --> 19:08.059
maybe I don't need
to have a say in this.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.627
Thank you.

19:10.671 --> 19:13.413
They couldn't have picked
a better person.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.415
[chuckles]

19:17.199 --> 19:19.158
Are you calling Zack?

19:19.201 --> 19:21.856
No, Sheldon. Would you say
that last part one more time?

19:23.640 --> 19:24.641
Oh, my...
