01:42.202 --> 01:45.454
Senators, consider the opportunities
for the Empire.

01:46.123 --> 01:50.126
At last, the destinies of the planets
Romulus and Remus will be united.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.713
Shinzon of Remus
is offering us a chance

01:53.797 --> 01:56.299
to make ourselves stronger
than ever before.

01:56.633 --> 01:59.093
It would be madness to reject it.

01:59.803 --> 02:03.806
I beg you not to let prejudice or politics

02:03.891 --> 02:06.100
interfere with this alliance.

02:06.602 --> 02:08.978
By joining Shinzon's forces with ours,

02:09.062 --> 02:11.814
not even the Federation
will be able to stand in our way...

02:11.899 --> 02:13.399
That's enough!

02:14.026 --> 02:15.735
The decision has been made.

02:15.819 --> 02:18.905
The military does not
dictate policy on Romulus.

02:19.323 --> 02:23.326
The Senate has considered
Shinzon's proposal and rejected it.

02:23.869 --> 02:26.662
He and his followers will be met with
all deliberate force

02:26.747 --> 02:29.749
and sent back to that black rock
they came from.

02:30.375 --> 02:34.629
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

02:46.016 --> 02:47.725
If you will excuse me, Praetor.

02:48.018 --> 02:50.102
I have an appointment
with the Tholian ambassador.

02:50.562 --> 02:51.896
Of course.

02:54.566 --> 02:57.818
Senators, are there any others
who wish to speak?

02:59.154 --> 03:04.033
Then I call for a vote on the motion to
open trade negotiations with Celes II.

03:04.493 --> 03:05.785
As you know, the Reman mines

03:05.869 --> 03:08.162
have not been filling their quotas
for months now.

03:08.246 --> 03:11.582
I hope that you will all bear in mind
the trade committee's findings.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.751
As much as we don't want...

03:43.073 --> 03:44.865
Would someone alert security?

03:44.950 --> 03:47.118
Bring back Senator Tal'Aura.

04:17.774 --> 04:18.774
Duty.

04:19.358 --> 04:23.279
A starship captain's life
is filled with solemn duty.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.282
I have commanded men in battle.

04:26.533 --> 04:31.245
I have negotiated peace treaties
between implacable enemies.

04:31.955 --> 04:33.956
I have represented the Federation

04:34.041 --> 04:37.626
in first contact with 27 alien species.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.756
But none of this compares
with my solemn duty today

04:44.051 --> 04:45.468
as best man.

04:47.012 --> 04:50.056
Now, I know on an occasion
such as this,

04:50.140 --> 04:52.224
it is expected that I be gracious

04:52.309 --> 04:57.188
and fulsome in my praise
on the wonders of this blessed union.

04:57.481 --> 05:01.317
But have the two of you
considered what you are doing to me?

05:02.527 --> 05:05.654
Of course you're happy,
but what about my needs?

05:06.281 --> 05:08.616
This is all a damned inconvenience.

05:09.659 --> 05:13.120
While you're happily settling in
on the Titan,

05:13.914 --> 05:18.542
I will be training my new First Officer.
You all know him.

05:18.668 --> 05:22.004
He's a tyrannical martinet
who will never

05:22.339 --> 05:24.757
ever allow me to go on away missions.

05:24.841 --> 05:28.094
That is the regulation, sir.
Starfleet Code, Section 12, Paragraph...

05:28.178 --> 05:30.012
- Mr. Data.
- Sir?

05:30.347 --> 05:31.889
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.

05:34.643 --> 05:37.353
Fifteen years
I've been waiting to say that.

05:39.189 --> 05:40.564
No, seriously.

05:40.649 --> 05:43.943
Will, Deanna,
there's still time to reconsider.

05:44.236 --> 05:45.319
Yes?

05:46.738 --> 05:47.780
- No.
- No.

05:47.864 --> 05:50.825
No? Oh, very well, then.

05:54.871 --> 05:59.708
Will Riker, you have been
my trusted right arm for 15 years.

06:00.252 --> 06:04.255
You have kept my course
true and steady.

06:06.091 --> 06:10.886
Deanna Troi, you've been my guide
and my conscience.

06:11.847 --> 06:15.641
You've helped me recognize
the better parts of myself.

06:17.185 --> 06:18.853
You are my family.

06:21.106 --> 06:23.399
And in best maritime tradition,

06:23.900 --> 06:27.528
I wish you both clear horizons.

06:27.737 --> 06:31.365
My good friends, make it so.

06:33.368 --> 06:34.577
The bride and groom.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.579
- To the bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom.

06:54.264 --> 06:56.765
You ever think about
getting married again?

06:56.975 --> 06:59.810
No. Twenty-three was my limit.

07:03.607 --> 07:04.732
Worf?

07:05.775 --> 07:09.820
- Are you all right?
- Romulan ale should be illegal.

07:10.447 --> 07:11.780
It is.

07:13.742 --> 07:16.535
- That was a lovely toast.
- It was from the heart.

07:16.661 --> 07:17.828
And you needn't worry.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.831
I'm going to brief your new counselor
on everything she needs to know.

07:20.916 --> 07:24.960
Oh, like hell you are.
You already know too much about me.

07:25.170 --> 07:29.798
I take it that there will be no speeches
during the ceremony on Betazed?

07:30.175 --> 07:32.968
No. No speeches and no clothes.

07:35.305 --> 07:38.849
Ladies and gentlemen
and invited transgendered species,

07:39.601 --> 07:42.853
in my study of Terran
and Betazoid conjugal rites

07:43.021 --> 07:47.441
I've discovered it is traditional
to present the happy couple

07:47.943 --> 07:49.318
with a gift.

07:50.028 --> 07:53.739
Given Commander Riker's affection
for archaic musical forms,

07:53.990 --> 07:56.992
I have elected to present the following
as my gift

07:57.202 --> 07:59.620
in honor of their conjugation.

08:00.830 --> 08:01.830
Conjugation!

08:01.957 --> 08:05.209
Never saw the sun shining so bright

08:05.585 --> 08:08.837
Never saw things going so right

08:09.089 --> 08:12.174
Noticing the days hurrying by

08:13.009 --> 08:16.262
When you're in love, my how they fly

08:16.346 --> 08:21.267
Blue skies
Smiling at me

08:21.851 --> 08:23.143
Irving Berlin.

08:23.228 --> 08:28.232
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

08:53.800 --> 08:55.467
It's tradition, Worf.

08:55.552 --> 08:57.886
You, of all people,
should appreciate that.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.722
I will not do it.

09:00.223 --> 09:01.932
Won't do what, Mr. Worf?

09:02.058 --> 09:04.310
Captain, I do not think it is appropriate

09:04.394 --> 09:07.771
for a Starfleet officer to appear naked.

09:08.064 --> 09:09.064
Oh, come now.

09:09.149 --> 09:13.402
A big, handsome, strapping fellow
like you? What can you be afraid of?

09:18.241 --> 09:22.328
Captain, I'm picking up
an unusual electromagnetic signature

09:22.412 --> 09:23.954
from the Kolarin system.

09:24.039 --> 09:27.291
- What sort of signature?
- Positronic.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.551
It's very faint.

09:37.635 --> 09:41.221
But I've isolated it to the third planet
in the Kolarin system.

09:41.431 --> 09:43.515
- What do we know about it?
- Uncharted.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.352
We'll have to get closer
for a more detailed scan.

09:46.436 --> 09:47.436
Theories?

09:47.520 --> 09:50.022
Since positronic signatures
have only been known to emanate

09:50.106 --> 09:51.690
from androids such as myself,

09:51.775 --> 09:55.569
it is logical to theorize
there is an android on Kolarus III.

09:55.820 --> 09:58.322
Just what I was afraid of. Captain,

09:58.948 --> 10:00.449
diverting to the Kolarin system

10:00.533 --> 10:03.160
takes us awfully close
to the Romulan Neutral Zone.

10:05.705 --> 10:09.625
It's still well on our side. I think...

10:12.295 --> 10:15.255
I think it's worth taking a look.
Don't worry, Number One.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.050
We'll still have you to Betazed
with plenty of time to spare.

10:18.134 --> 10:19.259
Thank you, sir.

10:19.344 --> 10:23.097
Where we will all honor
the Betazoid tradition.

10:23.390 --> 10:27.059
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the gym.

10:33.149 --> 10:37.820
Mr. Branson, lay in a course
for the Kolarin system, warp 5.

10:41.324 --> 10:44.868
What do you think, Data?
A long-lost relative?

11:02.679 --> 11:05.681
I'm reading six distinct
positronic signatures

11:05.765 --> 11:08.308
spread out over a few kilometers
on the planet's surface.

11:08.393 --> 11:10.686
What do we know
about the population of Kolarus III?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.813
Isolated pockets of humanoids.

11:12.897 --> 11:14.940
It appears to be a pre-warp civilization

11:15.024 --> 11:17.609
at an early stage
of industrial development.

11:17.902 --> 11:20.737
Captain, I wouldn't recommend
using the transporter.

11:20.822 --> 11:22.948
That ion storm
doesn't look very neighborly.

11:23.032 --> 11:25.200
It could head in our direction
without much warning.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.410
Understood.

11:32.333 --> 11:36.587
- Data, Mr. Worf, you're with me.
- Captain, I don't have to remind you...

11:36.671 --> 11:39.006
I appreciate your concern, Number One.

11:39.299 --> 11:43.218
- But I've been itching to try the Argo.
- I'll bet.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.014
Captain's prerogative.
There's no foreseeable danger.

11:47.390 --> 11:51.518
And your wife would never forgive me
if anything were to happen to you.

11:51.936 --> 11:54.563
You have the Bridge, Mr. Troi.

13:01.923 --> 13:04.383
I will always be puzzled
by the human predilection

13:04.467 --> 13:07.469
for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.

13:13.351 --> 13:15.894
Over that rise, sir. Half a kilometer.

13:39.502 --> 13:43.255
The radiant electromagnetic field
is interfering with my tricorder.

13:43.464 --> 13:45.799
We are within a few meters
of the signal.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.510
Fan out. Let's search around.

14:27.425 --> 14:32.012
- It appears to be a robotic arm.
- Very astute.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.349
Mr. Worf, bring it to the vehicle.

15:06.923 --> 15:08.674
This doesn't feel right.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.269
The final signature is approximately
100 meters to the north, sir.

15:51.759 --> 15:53.009
It's you.

15:54.429 --> 15:57.347
The resemblance is striking.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.694
- Fascinating.
- Fascinating.

16:15.366 --> 16:16.658
To the vehicle.

16:23.291 --> 16:26.960
I think it's time
to try some unsafe velocities.

16:46.189 --> 16:48.231
Why do you have a shiny head?

16:49.150 --> 16:51.443
This is not the appropriate time
for a conversation.

16:51.527 --> 16:52.569
Why?

16:52.653 --> 16:54.905
Because the Captain has to
concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

16:54.989 --> 16:56.198
- Why?
- Because...

16:56.282 --> 16:57.324
Data!

16:58.409 --> 16:59.701
Sorry, sir.

17:02.663 --> 17:04.372
Have I said something wrong?

17:47.416 --> 17:48.542
Data.

18:46.309 --> 18:50.437
- That's negative 3, cos/bar standard.
- Valve transfer initiated.

18:50.521 --> 18:55.317
You know, all things considered, Data,
I think you have nicer eyes.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.530
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.576
So what have we got, Geordi?

19:06.245 --> 19:08.371
I'd say he has the same
internal mechanics as Data

19:08.456 --> 19:10.373
but not as much
positronic development.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.959
The neural pathways
aren't nearly as sophisticated.

19:13.044 --> 19:15.003
I'd say he's a prototype.

19:15.296 --> 19:17.797
Something Dr. Soong created
prior to Data.

19:18.841 --> 19:20.634
Do you have a name, sir?

19:21.260 --> 19:23.845
I am B-4.

19:25.681 --> 19:26.765
B-4?

19:27.266 --> 19:30.936
Dr. Soong's penchant for whimsical
names seems to have no end.

19:32.063 --> 19:35.857
Can you tell us how you came to be
on the planet where we found you?

19:36.067 --> 19:37.484
I do not know.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.780
Do you remember anything of your life
before you were on the planet?

19:41.864 --> 19:46.534
No. Why does the tall man
have a furry face?

19:48.788 --> 19:53.291
Number One, keep me informed.
And, Geordi, reassemble him.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.501
Aye, sir.

19:58.547 --> 20:01.174
B-4, do you know who I am?

20:02.885 --> 20:04.427
You are me.

20:05.221 --> 20:06.221
No.

20:07.723 --> 20:09.349
My name is Data.

20:10.768 --> 20:12.435
I am your brother.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.608
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

20:23.864 --> 20:26.741
Captain, you have
an Alpha Priority communication

20:26.826 --> 20:29.244
- from Starfleet Command.
- Acknowledged.

20:35.042 --> 20:37.377
Admiral Janeway,
how good to see you again.

20:37.586 --> 20:41.089
Jean-Luc. How would you like
a trip to Romulus?

20:41.882 --> 20:45.051
- With or without the rest of the fleet?
- A diplomatic mission.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.595
We've been invited, believe it or not.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.099
Seems there's been some kind of
internal political shake-up.

20:51.267 --> 20:53.810
The new Praetor,
someone called Shinzon,

20:54.061 --> 20:56.229
has requested a Federation envoy.

20:56.355 --> 21:00.108
- New Praetor?
- Here's more. He's Reman.

21:00.943 --> 21:03.403
Believe me,
we don't understand it, either.

21:03.487 --> 21:04.904
You're the closest ship.

21:04.989 --> 21:07.198
So I want you to go and hear
what he has to say.

21:07.283 --> 21:09.034
Get the lay of the land.

21:09.285 --> 21:13.621
If the Empire becomes unstable, it could
mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.831
Understood.

21:14.915 --> 21:17.375
We're sending you
all the intelligence we have.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.127
But it's not much.

21:19.378 --> 21:22.130
I don't need to tell you
to watch your back, Jean-Luc.

21:22.256 --> 21:23.506
Hardly.

21:23.591 --> 21:26.134
The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans.

21:26.761 --> 21:29.137
You seem to get
all the easy assignments.

21:29.305 --> 21:30.889
Just lucky, Admiral.

21:30.973 --> 21:34.059
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.

21:41.609 --> 21:45.779
Helmsman, lay in a new course.
Take us to Romulus. Warp 8.

21:47.073 --> 21:50.325
- Aye-aye, sir. Course plotted and laid in.
- Romulus?

21:50.409 --> 21:53.161
I'm afraid The Opal Sea
will have to wait, Number One.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.454
Engage.

22:07.468 --> 22:11.054
As you can see, one side of Remus
always faces the sun.

22:11.347 --> 22:14.140
Due to the extreme temperatures
on that half of their world,

22:14.225 --> 22:16.935
the Remans live
on the dark side of the planet.

22:18.687 --> 22:21.189
Almost nothing is known
of the Reman homeworld,

22:21.273 --> 22:23.108
although intelligence scans
have proven

22:23.192 --> 22:26.820
the existence of dilithium mining
and heavy weapons construction.

22:28.697 --> 22:30.573
The Remans themselves
are considered

22:30.658 --> 22:33.576
an undesirable caste
in the hierarchy of the Empire.

22:33.911 --> 22:36.955
But they also have a reputation
for being formidable warriors.

22:37.039 --> 22:40.291
In the Dominion War, Reman troops
were used as assault forces

22:40.376 --> 22:41.793
in the most violent encounters.

22:41.877 --> 22:43.211
Cannon fodder.

22:43.295 --> 22:47.006
Yeah, but how did a Reman
get to be Praetor? I don't get it.

22:47.091 --> 22:49.342
We have to assume
he had Romulan collaborators.

22:49.426 --> 22:50.635
Coup d'état?

22:50.719 --> 22:52.971
The Praetor's power
has always been the Romulan fleet.

22:53.055 --> 22:56.224
They must have been behind Shinzon
for him to have overthrown the Senate.

22:56.308 --> 22:58.309
What have we learned about Shinzon?

22:58.394 --> 23:00.520
Starfleet intelligence
was only able to provide

23:00.604 --> 23:02.814
a partial account of his military record.

23:02.898 --> 23:05.984
We can infer he is relatively young
and a capable commander.

23:06.068 --> 23:09.654
He fought 12 major engagements
in the war. All successful.

23:09.738 --> 23:11.447
Beyond that, we know nothing.

23:11.907 --> 23:15.994
Well, it seems as though
we're truly sailing into the unknown.

23:17.371 --> 23:21.541
Keep at it. Anything you can give me
will be appreciated. Dismissed.

23:22.835 --> 23:26.254
I still can't believe the Captain
went along with a memory download.

23:28.007 --> 23:31.092
Captain Picard agrees that the B-4
was probably designed

23:31.177 --> 23:34.596
with the same self-actualization
parameters as myself.

23:35.431 --> 23:40.351
If my memory engrams are successfully
integrated into his positronic matrix,

23:40.936 --> 23:42.854
he should have all my abilities.

23:43.022 --> 23:46.316
Yeah. But he would also have
all of your memories as well.

23:46.442 --> 23:50.445
- You feel comfortable with that?
- I feel nothing, Geordi.

23:51.113 --> 23:53.823
It is my belief
that with my memory engrams

23:53.991 --> 23:57.368
he'll be able to function
as a more complete individual.

23:57.453 --> 24:00.955
- An individual more like you, you mean?
- Yes.

24:04.627 --> 24:07.128
Maybe he's not supposed
to be like you, Data.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.299
Maybe he's supposed to be
exactly the way he is.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.593
That might be so.

24:13.802 --> 24:17.805
But I believe he should have
the opportunity to explore his potential.

24:20.851 --> 24:22.894
Okay. We're done.

24:31.779 --> 24:33.988
B-4, do you know where you are?

24:34.865 --> 24:37.825
I am in a room with lights.

24:40.829 --> 24:43.498
Can you remember our father?

24:45.251 --> 24:47.877
- Our father?
- Yes. Dr. Soong.

24:49.380 --> 24:50.463
No.

24:51.507 --> 24:54.175
Do you know the name of the Captain
of this vessel?

24:54.301 --> 24:57.387
Captain... No.

25:00.766 --> 25:03.685
Data, he's assimilating
a lot of programming.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.438
Remember, he's a prototype,
a lot less sophisticated than you are.

25:07.523 --> 25:10.024
We just don't know if his matrix
will be able to adapt.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.402
We really need to give him some time.

25:13.696 --> 25:16.531
Geordi, what purpose does this serve?

25:17.199 --> 25:18.741
- What?
- This.

25:19.743 --> 25:21.995
That's a redundant memory port.

25:22.496 --> 25:26.374
Maybe the provisional memory storage
is in case his neural pathways overload.

25:26.834 --> 25:29.210
Do you mind if I keep him here
for a while?

25:29.295 --> 25:30.545
Run a few diagnostics?

25:31.380 --> 25:33.006
No, I do not mind.

25:33.799 --> 25:34.966
Data.

25:35.759 --> 25:38.469
No. You must remain
with Commander La Forge.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.930
He is going to try to help you.

25:50.399 --> 25:54.068
Captain's Log. Stardate 56844.9.

25:54.403 --> 25:56.988
The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus

25:57.072 --> 25:59.991
and is waiting
at the designated coordinates.

26:00.075 --> 26:02.702
All our hails have gone unanswered.

26:03.412 --> 26:06.039
We've been waiting for 17 hours.

26:12.087 --> 26:15.590
- Counselor?
- They're out there, sir.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.027
Captain, I recommend we raise shields.

26:36.111 --> 26:37.653
Not yet, Mr. Worf.

26:38.489 --> 26:41.532
Captain, with all due respect
to diplomatic protocol,

26:42.409 --> 26:44.869
the Federation Council
isn't sitting out here, we are.

26:44.953 --> 26:48.623
Patience. Diplomacy
is a very exacting occupation.

26:48.999 --> 26:50.917
- We will wait.
- Captain.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.550
- Raising shields.
- No.

26:59.635 --> 27:02.345
- Captain.
- Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf.

27:04.973 --> 27:08.976
Fifty-two disruptor banks,
27 photon torpedo bays,

27:09.061 --> 27:11.270
primary and secondary shields.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.900
She's a predator.

27:28.539 --> 27:30.289
We are being hailed.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.333
On-screen.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.048
Enterprise,

27:40.509 --> 27:44.262
we are the Reman warbird, Scimitar.

27:45.097 --> 27:48.975
- Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
- I am not Shinzon.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.270
I am his viceroy.

27:54.022 --> 27:56.607
We are sending transport coordinates.

28:00.446 --> 28:04.323
- Not very chatty.
- Away team, Transporter Room 4.

28:51.246 --> 28:53.748
I hope you'll forgive the darkness.

28:55.709 --> 28:58.127
We are not comfortable in the light.

28:59.922 --> 29:04.091
- Praetor Shinzon?
- Captain Picard.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.971
Jean-Luc Picard.

29:11.475 --> 29:15.436
I'd always imagined you a little taller.
Isn't that odd?

29:18.190 --> 29:21.442
Now, you may scan me
without subterfuge, Commander Data.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.375
- You are not as we imagined you.
- No?

29:37.793 --> 29:39.168
You are human.

29:44.883 --> 29:47.134
Why have you asked us to come here?

29:49.805 --> 29:51.055
Praetor?

29:51.974 --> 29:56.143
- I've never met a human woman before.
- I'm only half human.

29:56.770 --> 29:59.730
Deanna Troi of Betazed.

30:00.691 --> 30:04.694
Empathic and telepathic abilities.
Ship's counselor.

30:05.654 --> 30:09.365
All this I knew.
But I never knew you were so beautiful.

30:09.533 --> 30:12.243
You seem quite familiar
with our personnel.

30:12.452 --> 30:14.453
Oh, I am, Commander Riker.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.249
May I touch your hair?

30:18.333 --> 30:22.837
We came to Romulus on a matter we
were assured was of great importance.

30:23.171 --> 30:24.839
If you have anything to say to us

30:24.923 --> 30:28.676
as representatives of the Federation,
I suggest you do it now.

30:29.344 --> 30:32.680
Yes. I'm sorry, Captain.

30:33.348 --> 30:35.433
There is so much we need to talk about.

30:35.517 --> 30:38.269
I would be interested to know
what we are talking about.

30:38.353 --> 30:40.313
Unity, Captain.

30:41.148 --> 30:45.693
Tearing down the walls between us
to recognize that we are one.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.032
I'm talking of the thing
that makes us the same.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.536
Peace. We want peace.

31:00.709 --> 31:04.378
Right now you're thinking
this all sounds too good to be true,

31:04.755 --> 31:06.589
but you're also thinking

31:06.840 --> 31:09.884
that the chance for peace
is too promising to ignore.

31:12.596 --> 31:13.971
Am I right?

31:17.017 --> 31:18.059
Yes.

31:18.644 --> 31:22.355
Then, perhaps it's time to add
some illumination to our discussion.

31:22.898 --> 31:25.733
Computer, raise the lighting four levels.

31:40.165 --> 31:44.669
When I was very young,
I was stricken with an odd disease.

31:46.380 --> 31:49.173
I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.

31:50.092 --> 31:52.843
Even the slightest whisper
caused me agony.

31:52.928 --> 31:54.929
No one could do anything about it.

31:55.013 --> 31:59.475
Finally, I was taken to a doctor who had
some experience of Terran illnesses.

31:59.601 --> 32:02.269
And he diagnosed me
with Shalaft's Syndrome.

32:04.940 --> 32:06.774
Do you know of it, Captain?

32:12.322 --> 32:13.406
Yes.

32:14.866 --> 32:17.618
Then you know
it's a very rare syndrome.

32:18.328 --> 32:19.620
Genetic.

32:21.039 --> 32:24.417
Apparently, all the male members
of a family have it.

32:25.627 --> 32:30.256
Eventually, I was treated and now
I can hear as well as you can, Captain.

32:31.633 --> 32:34.301
I can see as well as you can.

32:35.470 --> 32:38.556
I can feel everything you feel.

32:40.350 --> 32:41.684
In fact,

32:42.644 --> 32:46.439
I feel exactly what you feel.

32:47.816 --> 32:49.483
Don't I, Jean-Luc?

32:51.987 --> 32:55.740
Come to dinner tomorrow on Romulus.
Just the two of us.

32:56.992 --> 33:00.703
Or should I say, just the one of us?

33:16.344 --> 33:18.679
I think you'll be wanting this.

33:22.350 --> 33:26.187
Until tomorrow then, Captain.
We have much to discuss.

33:30.692 --> 33:33.611
Computer, return lighting
to previous level.

34:04.726 --> 34:06.143
There's no doubt, Captain.

34:06.228 --> 34:09.563
Right down to your aggressive
strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.190
He's a clone.

34:11.608 --> 34:14.735
They probably used a hair follicle
or a skin cell.

34:15.277 --> 34:19.322
- Why?
- I intend to find out, Number One.

34:20.408 --> 34:22.909
Inform Starfleet of the situation.

34:23.245 --> 34:26.080
I need to know
where the hell he came from.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.333
Counselor.

34:33.045 --> 34:36.674
We supported you, Shinzon,
when you assassinated the Senate.

34:36.757 --> 34:40.261
You told us the timing was perfect
for an attack on the Federation.

34:40.719 --> 34:43.347
I don't understand why now you delay.

34:43.431 --> 34:45.599
You don't have to understand.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.560
And bringing the Enterprise here,

34:47.643 --> 34:49.520
what possible purpose
could that serve?

34:49.603 --> 34:52.940
- I have a purpose.
- Then, perhaps you'll enlighten us.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.525
Silence, Romulan!

35:02.617 --> 35:06.036
You really must learn patience,
Commander.

35:07.372 --> 35:11.792
Spend 18 hours every day
under the lash of a Romulan guard

35:11.877 --> 35:14.420
and you'll soon understand patience.

35:17.257 --> 35:18.424
Now go.

35:27.851 --> 35:29.518
Commander Donatra.

35:31.479 --> 35:32.938
Please remain.

35:42.657 --> 35:45.159
There's a word I want you to consider.

35:46.453 --> 35:50.915
Allegiance. It's something I demand
from those who serve me.

35:51.166 --> 35:53.667
- Do I serve you?
- Yes.

35:54.961 --> 35:56.837
And, I think, faithfully.

35:57.547 --> 36:00.174
Commander Suran, on the other hand,

36:01.384 --> 36:02.927
gives me pause.

36:03.511 --> 36:05.679
Here's another word, Praetor.

36:07.807 --> 36:08.933
Trust.

36:11.853 --> 36:14.021
Do you trust me?

36:15.315 --> 36:17.858
How far does that trust extend?

36:18.360 --> 36:21.695
How deep does it go?

36:24.032 --> 36:27.660
What must a commander do
to prove herself faithful to you?

36:29.454 --> 36:31.121
What must a woman do?

36:32.666 --> 36:36.168
You are not a woman.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.254
You are a Romulan.

36:40.423 --> 36:43.384
Serve me faithfully
and you will be rewarded.

36:44.803 --> 36:49.056
Keep those lovely eyes
on Commander Suran.

36:50.558 --> 36:54.061
And at the first sign of treachery...

36:58.233 --> 36:59.692
Dispose of him?

37:01.236 --> 37:03.612
Then you will have proven yourself.

37:11.579 --> 37:12.746
Now go.

37:23.258 --> 37:24.925
And, Commander,

37:28.013 --> 37:31.515
if you ever touch me again,

37:34.060 --> 37:35.561
I'll kill you.

38:46.841 --> 38:50.260
The Romulans had somehow
gained possession of your DNA

38:50.678 --> 38:52.471
and I had been created.

38:52.680 --> 38:57.017
And when I was ready,
they were going to replace you with me.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.688
Put a Romulan agent
at the heart of Starfleet.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.525
- It was a bold plan.
- What happened?

39:05.401 --> 39:07.778
As happens frequently on Romulus,

39:08.363 --> 39:12.533
a new government came to power.
They decided to abandon the plan.

39:13.159 --> 39:15.786
They were afraid
that I might be discovered

39:15.912 --> 39:17.871
and that it would lead to war.

39:22.669 --> 39:25.003
Not quite the face you remember.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.173
Not quite.

39:28.842 --> 39:31.343
A lifetime of violence will do that.

39:32.679 --> 39:34.805
They broke my nose, my jaw.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.474
But so much is the same.

39:38.726 --> 39:39.977
The eyes.

39:40.979 --> 39:44.231
- Surely you recognize the eyes?
- Yes.

39:44.732 --> 39:47.234
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?

39:48.945 --> 39:51.029
And yours are so confident.

39:57.078 --> 39:59.621
So, I'm not as tall as you expected?

40:00.165 --> 40:03.375
I had always hoped
I might hit two meters.

40:03.751 --> 40:04.960
As had I.

40:09.591 --> 40:11.758
How did you end up on Remus?

40:13.970 --> 40:16.013
They sent me there to die.

40:17.724 --> 40:21.101
How could a mere human survive
the dilithium mines?

40:22.437 --> 40:23.645
Not that it mattered

40:23.938 --> 40:27.232
as I was no longer part of their plans
against the Federation.

40:29.569 --> 40:32.613
In those terrible depths
lived only the damned.

40:33.573 --> 40:35.324
Together with the Reman slaves,

40:35.408 --> 40:38.869
I was condemned to an existence
of unceasing labor and starvation

40:38.953 --> 40:41.914
under the brutal heel
of the Romulan guards.

40:42.457 --> 40:45.292
Only the very strongest
had any hope of survival.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.337
I was only a child when they took me.

40:49.255 --> 40:53.008
Then I didn't see the sun or the stars
again for nearly 10 years.

40:55.637 --> 40:59.473
The only thing the Romulan guards
hated more than the Remans

41:00.141 --> 41:01.350
was me.

41:06.814 --> 41:08.899
But one man took pity on me.

41:10.860 --> 41:13.403
The man that became my viceroy.

41:14.656 --> 41:17.324
He protected me
from the cruelty of the guards

41:18.493 --> 41:20.661
and taught me how to survive.

41:21.496 --> 41:25.374
And in that dark place
where there was nothing of myself,

41:26.209 --> 41:28.502
I found my Reman brothers.

41:32.257 --> 41:35.592
They showed me the only true kindness
I've ever known.

41:36.010 --> 41:38.303
You're doing this
to liberate the Remans?

41:38.596 --> 41:42.182
That is the single thought
behind everything I have done.

41:42.684 --> 41:46.353
From building the Scimitarat a secret
base to assembling my army.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.480
Finally, coming to Romulus in force.

41:49.357 --> 41:53.110
I knew they would never give us
our freedom. I would have to take it.

41:53.194 --> 41:56.363
How many Romulans died
for your freedom?

41:58.449 --> 41:59.491
Too many.

41:59.826 --> 42:04.621
But the point is that finally the Empire
is realizing that there is a better way.

42:05.206 --> 42:07.040
And that way is peace.

42:12.714 --> 42:16.550
- You don't trust me.
- I have no reason to.

42:17.051 --> 42:18.927
You have every reason.

42:19.929 --> 42:24.016
If you had lived my life and experienced
the suffering of my people

42:25.226 --> 42:26.810
you'd be standing where I am.

42:26.894 --> 42:28.145
And if you had lived my life

42:28.229 --> 42:31.189
you would understand
my responsibility to the Federation.

42:31.274 --> 42:36.111
I cannot allow my personal feelings
to unduly influence my decisions.

42:36.195 --> 42:39.573
All I have are my personal feelings.

42:45.246 --> 42:48.123
I want to know
what it means to be human.

42:49.042 --> 42:51.585
The Remans have given me a future.

42:52.795 --> 42:57.257
- But you can tell me about my past.
- I can tell you about my past.

42:59.802 --> 43:03.930
- Were we Picards always warriors?
- I think of myself as an explorer.

43:04.932 --> 43:06.892
Were we always explorers?

43:08.770 --> 43:11.938
I was the first Picard
to leave our solar system.

43:12.774 --> 43:15.609
It caused quite a stir in the family.

43:16.194 --> 43:20.155
But I'd spent my youth...

43:20.281 --> 43:25.160
Looking up at the stars, dreaming
about what was up there, about...

43:25.370 --> 43:26.745
New worlds.

43:41.094 --> 43:43.595
I'm trying to believe you, Shinzon.

43:48.059 --> 43:51.853
If there is one ideal that
the Federation holds most dear,

43:52.939 --> 43:55.023
it is that all men,

43:55.858 --> 43:57.943
all races, can be united.

43:59.612 --> 44:01.363
What better example?

44:01.906 --> 44:06.493
A Starfleet captain
standing in the Romulan Senate.

44:10.915 --> 44:15.168
Nothing would make me more proud
than to take your hand in friendship.

44:17.338 --> 44:18.839
In time.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.926
When that trust has been earned.

44:28.516 --> 44:31.268
Captain, we have had an unauthorized
access into the main computer.

44:31.352 --> 44:32.477
Source?

44:32.562 --> 44:34.855
It's gonna take some time
to figure that out, Captain.

44:34.939 --> 44:38.150
The data stream was re-routed
through sub-stations all over the ship.

44:38.234 --> 44:42.529
- What programs were accessed?
- That's what I can't figure out.

44:42.989 --> 44:45.240
It's mostly just basic stellar cartography.

44:45.366 --> 44:47.576
Star charts, communications protocols,

44:47.660 --> 44:49.327
some uplinks
from colony tracking stations.

44:49.412 --> 44:51.246
It's not even restricted material.

44:51.330 --> 44:54.082
Nevertheless, we must learn the source.
Keep me informed.

44:54.167 --> 44:56.293
Captain, there's something else.

44:57.712 --> 45:00.881
I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Look at this.

45:02.049 --> 45:03.300
When the Scimitarde-cloaked,

45:03.384 --> 45:07.053
there was a momentary spike
in the tertiary EM band. There.

45:07.763 --> 45:11.224
You're not going to believe this.
It's thalaron.

45:15.563 --> 45:18.231
I thought thalaron radiation
was theoretical.

45:18.316 --> 45:21.818
Which is why our initial scans didn't
pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.

45:21.903 --> 45:24.154
Thalaron research
was banned in the Federation

45:24.238 --> 45:26.114
because of its biogenic properties.

45:26.199 --> 45:30.243
It has the ability to consume organic
material at the subatomic level.

45:30.536 --> 45:34.414
I can't overestimate the danger
of thalaron radiation, Jean-Luc.

45:34.665 --> 45:37.209
A microscopic amount could kill
every living thing

45:37.293 --> 45:39.002
on this ship in a matter of seconds.

45:39.086 --> 45:41.087
I understand. Keep on it.

45:41.589 --> 45:45.258
I want to know what he has
and how we can neutralize any threat.

45:45.635 --> 45:47.093
I need options.

46:00.107 --> 46:03.235
This was a mistake.
We're wasting time.

46:04.487 --> 46:06.404
My time.

46:07.782 --> 46:09.741
And I shall spend it how I choose.

46:09.867 --> 46:12.369
Do not forget our mission, Shinzon.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.914
We must act. Now.

46:22.171 --> 46:24.297
We'll return to the Scimitar.

46:26.008 --> 46:28.176
I was merely curious about him.

46:43.484 --> 46:44.693
Come.

46:47.321 --> 46:48.863
Beverly, come in.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.536
Remember him?

46:57.832 --> 47:01.668
- He was a bit cocky, as I recall.
- He was a damned fool.

47:02.169 --> 47:05.797
Selfish. Ambitious.
Very much in need of seasoning.

47:06.841 --> 47:08.800
He turned out all right.

47:11.721 --> 47:14.347
I really wanted to believe Shinzon.

47:15.349 --> 47:20.270
But this thalaron radiation
just can't be explained away.

47:22.690 --> 47:26.568
Whatever he's after, it isn't peace.

47:27.612 --> 47:30.030
Is he very much the way you were?

47:33.701 --> 47:34.868
Oh, yes.

47:36.120 --> 47:38.538
- Data to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead, Data.

47:38.664 --> 47:39.664
Captain,

47:39.749 --> 47:43.918
Geordi and I have identified the source
of the unauthorized computer access.

47:44.253 --> 47:47.464
And I believe we have found a way
to gain a tactical advantage.

47:47.548 --> 47:48.882
On my way.

48:02.188 --> 48:03.271
Will?

48:04.649 --> 48:08.443
As ship's counselor,
I recommend you get some sleep.

48:10.571 --> 48:12.072
Some honeymoon.

48:16.869 --> 48:18.244
Come to bed.

48:20.873 --> 48:22.082
Imzadi.

48:46.357 --> 48:47.565
Imzadi.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.445
He can never know you as I can.

48:53.072 --> 48:55.198
He can never touch you as I can.

48:55.282 --> 48:58.451
- This isn't real!
- Then feel my lips.

49:06.961 --> 49:08.628
I'm with you, imzadi.

49:09.922 --> 49:11.965
I'll always be with you now.

49:13.426 --> 49:15.844
- This isn't real!
- Deanna, what's the matter?

49:15.970 --> 49:17.178
- No!
- Deanna?

49:17.263 --> 49:19.973
- Deanna!
- No!

49:24.353 --> 49:26.354
The bond has been broken.

49:29.650 --> 49:31.151
Find her again.

49:35.489 --> 49:36.489
Praetor,

49:36.741 --> 49:39.200
we've received the transponder signal.

49:50.254 --> 49:54.507
It's accelerating.
You have no more time for games.

49:59.138 --> 50:00.847
Have the doctors prepare.

50:15.070 --> 50:16.404
Transport.

50:25.623 --> 50:27.373
Begin the download.

50:45.351 --> 50:47.560
Tea, hot.

51:02.409 --> 51:05.995
Aside from slightly elevated levels
of adrenalin and serotonin,

51:06.080 --> 51:07.956
you're perfectly normal.

51:12.086 --> 51:15.255
Deanna, can you describe it?

51:15.756 --> 51:17.090
It was...

51:19.677 --> 51:21.427
It was a violation.

51:22.596 --> 51:27.183
Shinzon's viceroy seems to have
the ability to reach into my thoughts.

51:27.768 --> 51:31.271
I've become a liability.
I request to be relieved of my duties.

51:31.730 --> 51:33.273
Permission denied.

51:34.275 --> 51:37.777
If you can endure more of
these assaults, I need you at my side.

51:37.903 --> 51:39.529
Now more than ever.

51:39.947 --> 51:42.448
The Enterprise
is far from Federation space...

51:45.744 --> 51:46.953
Worf, shields up!

51:58.424 --> 51:59.966
Hello, Jean-Luc.

52:01.677 --> 52:04.262
Why am I here?
Why have you done this?

52:04.805 --> 52:06.264
I was lonely.

52:17.860 --> 52:21.446
- What are you going to do?
- I need a sample of your blood.

52:22.865 --> 52:27.535
What is it your Borg friends say?
"Resistance is futile."

52:34.877 --> 52:37.086
Oh, yes, the android.

52:38.213 --> 52:43.217
- The bait you couldn't refuse.
- All of this so you could capture me?

52:44.178 --> 52:46.054
Don't be so vain.

52:47.973 --> 52:51.559
After we found it,
we had to make a few modifications.

52:52.061 --> 52:55.688
An extra memory port,
a hidden transponder.

52:55.898 --> 52:59.525
I've now gained access
to Starfleet's communications protocol.

53:00.027 --> 53:03.321
I now know the exact location
of your entire fleet.

53:05.074 --> 53:08.076
- You may go.
- Where?

53:10.788 --> 53:12.372
Out of my sight.

53:16.877 --> 53:18.461
What is all this about?

53:18.545 --> 53:22.215
It's about destiny, Picard.

53:22.549 --> 53:26.010
- It's about a Reman outcast.
- You're not Reman!

53:26.095 --> 53:30.223
And I'm not quite human. So what am I?

53:31.225 --> 53:35.561
My life is meaningless
as long as you're still alive.

53:37.481 --> 53:39.440
What am I while you exist?

53:40.442 --> 53:43.236
A shadow? An echo?

53:43.570 --> 53:46.155
If your issues are with me,
then deal with me.

53:46.240 --> 53:49.659
This has nothing to do with my ship.
Nothing to do with the Federation.

53:49.743 --> 53:51.577
But it does.

53:51.870 --> 53:55.248
We will no longer
bow before anyone as slaves.

53:55.332 --> 53:59.085
Not the Romulans,
and not your mighty Federation.

53:59.753 --> 54:03.006
We are a race bred for war.

54:04.717 --> 54:06.175
And conquest.

54:06.343 --> 54:09.345
Are you ready to plunge
the entire quadrant into war

54:09.430 --> 54:12.306
to satisfy your own personal demons?

54:12.683 --> 54:15.852
It amazes me
how little you know yourself.

54:15.936 --> 54:19.480
- I'm incapable of such an act.
- You are me.

54:23.485 --> 54:28.489
The same noble Picard blood
runs through our veins.

54:30.743 --> 54:34.037
Had you lived my life,
you'd be doing exactly as I am.

54:35.205 --> 54:39.625
So look in the mirror. See yourself.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.630
Consider that, Captain.

54:46.300 --> 54:48.885
I can think of no greater torment for you.

54:55.934 --> 54:57.351
Shinzon.

54:58.729 --> 55:00.938
I'm a mirror for you as well.

55:04.860 --> 55:06.694
Not for long, Captain.

55:07.654 --> 55:09.447
I'm afraid you won't survive to witness

55:09.531 --> 55:13.242
the victory of the echo over the voice.

55:30.511 --> 55:32.261
His cloak is perfect.

55:32.346 --> 55:35.723
No tachyon emissions,
no residual antiprotons.

55:36.016 --> 55:38.434
Keep at it, Geordi. Find a way in.

55:48.946 --> 55:51.864
Praetor Shinzon needs the prisoner.

56:02.501 --> 56:05.837
- About time, Mr. Data.
- My mission was a success, sir.

56:07.464 --> 56:09.924
I've located the source of the radiation.

56:10.217 --> 56:13.553
This entire ship
is essentially a thalaron generator.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.472
Its power relays lead
to an activation matrix on the Bridge.

56:16.557 --> 56:18.891
- It's a weapon.
- It would appear so.

56:19.059 --> 56:20.351
What about the download?

56:20.435 --> 56:23.146
Shinzon believes he has
our communication protocols.

56:23.230 --> 56:26.440
They will give him inaccurate locations
for all Starfleet vessels.

56:26.525 --> 56:28.192
- Good work.
- Sir.

56:31.613 --> 56:35.658
Geordi supplied me with a prototype
for the Emergency Transport Unit.

56:37.077 --> 56:40.413
I recommend you use this, sir,
to return to the Enterprise.

56:40.914 --> 56:44.250
- It'll only work for one of us.
- Yes, sir.

56:52.134 --> 56:54.093
We'll find a way off together.

57:07.524 --> 57:09.692
It is time for the procedure.

57:25.042 --> 57:27.043
Move, puny human animal.

57:28.879 --> 57:30.713
A bit less florid, Data.

58:01.995 --> 58:03.287
Kill him!

58:15.968 --> 58:17.093
This way, sir.

58:17.177 --> 58:20.429
There is a shuttlebay
94 meters from our current position.

58:38.156 --> 58:41.534
- There it is, sir.
- Go!

59:09.896 --> 59:11.022
Data!

59:11.898 --> 59:14.817
It appears to have
an encrypted security system.

59:14.901 --> 59:17.653
Alacrity would be appreciated,
Commander!

59:17.738 --> 59:20.364
Reman is a most complex language
with pictographs

59:20.449 --> 59:21.991
representing certain verb roots...

59:22.075 --> 59:25.745
While I find that fascinating, Data,
we really need that door open!

01:00:04.576 --> 01:00:08.829
According to the ship's manifest,
they're Scorpion-class attack fliers.

01:00:26.807 --> 01:00:30.851
- Data, what do you imagine this is?
- Port thruster, sir.

01:00:30.936 --> 01:00:33.312
Would you like me to drive, sir?

01:00:46.034 --> 01:00:48.452
Data,
can you open the shuttlebay doors?

01:00:48.537 --> 01:00:50.788
Negative, sir.
They've erected a force field

01:00:50.872 --> 01:00:52.123
around the external portholes.

01:00:52.207 --> 01:00:55.334
Well, then, only one way to go.

01:01:04.803 --> 01:01:07.471
Do you think
this is a wise course of action, sir?

01:01:07.556 --> 01:01:09.807
We're about to find out, Data.

01:01:10.225 --> 01:01:12.560
Power up the disruptors.

01:01:12.644 --> 01:01:15.020
- Ready, Captain.
- Fire.

01:01:54.227 --> 01:01:55.895
Tractor beam, now!

01:01:58.899 --> 01:02:00.941
Worf, lock on transporters.

01:02:08.867 --> 01:02:10.534
I have them, sir.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.338
This has gone far enough.

01:02:22.422 --> 01:02:25.966
I thought we'd discussed patience,
Commander.

01:02:26.051 --> 01:02:27.551
Mine is wearing thin.

01:02:28.094 --> 01:02:30.638
We supported you
because you promised action.

01:02:30.722 --> 01:02:32.431
And yet, you delay.

01:02:35.143 --> 01:02:37.603
The Enterprise is immaterial.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.773
It won't even make it out
of the Neutral Zone.

01:02:41.775 --> 01:02:43.484
And in two days

01:02:43.568 --> 01:02:47.780
the Federation will be crippled
beyond repair.

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.949
Does that satisfy you?

01:02:51.243 --> 01:02:52.952
For the moment.

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:54.411
And when I return,

01:02:54.496 --> 01:02:57.748
you and I shall have a little talk

01:02:57.832 --> 01:03:00.668
about showing proper respect.

01:03:06.424 --> 01:03:08.634
What's happening to his face?

01:03:15.433 --> 01:03:17.226
Commander, a moment.

01:03:21.022 --> 01:03:24.900
Are you truly prepared
to have your hands drenched in blood?

01:03:24.985 --> 01:03:27.486
He's not planning to defeat Earth.

01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:30.072
He's planning its annihilation.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.036
And his sins will mark us
and our children for generations.

01:03:41.668 --> 01:03:45.212
The more I studied his DNA,
the more confusing it got.

01:03:45.297 --> 01:03:47.756
Finally,
I could come to only one conclusion.

01:03:47.841 --> 01:03:50.968
Shinzon was created
with temporal RNA sequencing.

01:03:51.052 --> 01:03:53.137
He was designed
so that at a certain point

01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:55.598
his aging process could be accelerated

01:03:55.682 --> 01:03:57.224
to reach your age more quickly.

01:03:57.309 --> 01:04:00.227
He was engineered
to skip 30 years of his life.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.272
But when the temporal sequencing
wasn't activated,

01:04:03.356 --> 01:04:06.275
his cellular structure
started breaking down.

01:04:06.359 --> 01:04:07.776
He's dying.

01:04:08.695 --> 01:04:09.903
Dying?

01:04:11.865 --> 01:04:14.283
Can anything be done for him?

01:04:14.367 --> 01:04:16.201
Nothing, except a complete transfusion

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:19.038
from the only donor
with compatible DNA.

01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:21.206
You.

01:04:26.046 --> 01:04:30.549
- How long does he have?
- I can't say for sure.

01:04:30.717 --> 01:04:33.844
But the rate of decay
seems to be accelerating.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.725
Then he'll come for me.

01:05:07.045 --> 01:05:08.420
Brother,

01:05:08.755 --> 01:05:11.840
- I cannot move.
- No.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.512
I have only activated your cognitive
and communication subroutines.

01:05:16.721 --> 01:05:18.222
Why?

01:05:18.306 --> 01:05:22.101
- Because you are dangerous.
- Why?

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:24.353
You have been
programmed to gather information

01:05:24.437 --> 01:05:26.939
that can be used against this ship.

01:05:27.607 --> 01:05:30.943
I do not understand.

01:05:32.487 --> 01:05:33.654
I know.

01:05:37.951 --> 01:05:41.995
Do you know anything about
Shinzon's plans against the Federation?

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.623
No.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:49.712
Do you have any knowledge
of the tactical abilities of his ship?

01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:51.255
No.

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:54.466
Can I move now?

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.802
No.

01:06:00.473 --> 01:06:03.016
What are you doing?

01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:07.146
- I must deactivate you.
- For how long?

01:06:09.691 --> 01:06:11.233
Indefinitely.

01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:14.820
How long is...

01:06:22.704 --> 01:06:24.538
A long time, brother.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.168
It's called a cascading biogenic pulse.

01:06:29.502 --> 01:06:31.587
The unique properties
of thalaron radiation

01:06:31.671 --> 01:06:34.590
allow the energy beam
to expand almost without limit.

01:06:34.674 --> 01:06:38.844
Depending on its radiant intensity,
it could encompass a ship

01:06:39.846 --> 01:06:41.847
or a planet.

01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:46.894
He would only have built a weapon
of such scope

01:06:46.978 --> 01:06:48.395
for one reason.

01:06:49.981 --> 01:06:53.776
- He's going after Earth.
- How can you be certain?

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:57.154
I know how he thinks.

01:06:57.238 --> 01:07:00.491
Destroy humanity,
you cripple the Federation.

01:07:00.575 --> 01:07:05.329
- The Romulans invade.
- No way of penetrating his cloak?

01:07:05.413 --> 01:07:06.455
No.

01:07:08.249 --> 01:07:11.251
So he could pass within 10 meters
of every ship in Starfleet

01:07:11.336 --> 01:07:13.212
and they'd never know.

01:07:15.089 --> 01:07:17.800
We do have one advantage, though.

01:07:17.884 --> 01:07:20.427
He needs your blood to live.

01:07:20.512 --> 01:07:24.890
- He might come after you first.
- I'm counting on it.

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:27.142
We've been ordered to Sector 10-45.

01:07:27.227 --> 01:07:29.520
Our fleet has been diverted
to meet us there.

01:07:29.604 --> 01:07:33.232
- Strength in numbers.
- Yes, at least that's what we hope.

01:07:34.025 --> 01:07:36.860
He must not be allowed
to use that weapon.

01:07:38.071 --> 01:07:40.531
All other concerns are secondary.

01:07:44.911 --> 01:07:46.286
You understand me?

01:07:52.627 --> 01:07:53.961
Yes, sir.

01:07:56.881 --> 01:08:00.425
All hands, battle stations.

01:08:14.732 --> 01:08:16.692
Initiate the force field.

01:08:36.379 --> 01:08:38.671
Captain's Personal Log, supplemental.

01:08:38.756 --> 01:08:41.633
We're heading toward Federation space
at maximum warp.

01:08:41.843 --> 01:08:43.093
The crew has responded

01:08:43.176 --> 01:08:45.845
with the dedication
I've come to expect of them.

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:49.975
Like a thousand other commanders
on a thousand other battlefields,

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.852
I wait for the dawn.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.542
How long?

01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:20.339
A matter of hours.

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:25.469
We must begin the procedure now.

01:09:31.225 --> 01:09:33.685
How long until we reach the Rift?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.064
Seven minutes.

01:09:58.086 --> 01:10:00.545
Data, what's our current position?

01:10:04.884 --> 01:10:07.344
How soon until we reach the fleet?

01:10:08.054 --> 01:10:09.388
At our current velocity,

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:13.600
we will arrive at Sector 10-45
in approximately 40 minutes, sir.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.445
"For now we see but
through a glass, darkly."

01:10:26.531 --> 01:10:29.574
- Sir?
- He said he is a mirror.

01:10:31.119 --> 01:10:33.161
- Of you, sir?
- Yes.

01:10:35.415 --> 01:10:37.165
I do not agree.

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:40.127
Although you share
the same genetic structure,

01:10:40.211 --> 01:10:43.714
the events of your life
have created a unique individual.

01:10:43.798 --> 01:10:45.966
If I had lived his life,

01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:49.344
is it possible that
I would have rejected my humanity?

01:10:49.429 --> 01:10:51.930
The B-4 is physically identical to me

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:54.850
although his neural pathways
are not as advanced.

01:10:54.934 --> 01:10:58.103
But even if they were,
he would not be me.

01:10:58.646 --> 01:11:02.816
- How can you be sure?
- I aspire, sir, to be better than I am.

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.779
B-4 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

01:11:10.783 --> 01:11:13.076
We are passing through
the Bassen Rift, sir.

01:11:13.161 --> 01:11:15.620
The projection will return
when we have cleared it.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:18.874
It's interfering with our uplink
from Starfleet cartography?

01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:22.252
The Rift affects all long-range...

01:11:23.629 --> 01:11:25.464
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:34.389
Target weapons systems and shields.

01:11:34.932 --> 01:11:37.768
I don't want the Enterprise destroyed.

01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:06.505
Can you learn to see in the dark,
Captain?

01:12:07.507 --> 01:12:08.757
Report.

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.718
He's firing from the cloak.
We can't get a lock.

01:12:11.803 --> 01:12:13.720
He disabled our warp drive
with his first shot.

01:12:13.805 --> 01:12:15.597
We only have impulse, Captain.

01:12:15.681 --> 01:12:18.141
Mr. Worf, prepare
a full phaser spread, zero elevation.

01:12:18.226 --> 01:12:19.768
All banks on my mark.

01:12:19.852 --> 01:12:22.437
Scan for shield impacts.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

01:12:22.522 --> 01:12:23.814
Aye, sir.

01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:25.774
Fire!

01:12:36.744 --> 01:12:38.745
You're too slow, old man.

01:12:40.331 --> 01:12:42.874
Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

01:12:59.392 --> 01:13:01.434
We are losing dorsal shields.

01:13:01.519 --> 01:13:03.645
Full axis rotation to port!

01:13:03.729 --> 01:13:05.647
Fire all ventral phasers.

01:13:17.535 --> 01:13:19.870
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

01:13:20.246 --> 01:13:23.498
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
Get the shields online, Geordi.

01:13:23.583 --> 01:13:25.125
Already on it.

01:13:26.252 --> 01:13:28.503
Counselor Troi, report to the Bridge.

01:13:28.588 --> 01:13:31.882
Captain, we are being hailed.

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:33.925
On-screen.

01:13:36.095 --> 01:13:37.762
Captain Picard,

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:42.601
will you join me in your Ready Room?

01:14:00.453 --> 01:14:02.746
You can't trace
my holographic emitters, Captain,

01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:06.833
so don't bother.
And you can't contact Starfleet.

01:14:06.918 --> 01:14:09.586
It's just the two of us now, Jean-Luc.

01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:11.671
As it should be.

01:14:12.131 --> 01:14:16.218
- Why are you here?
- To accept your surrender.

01:14:17.136 --> 01:14:19.971
I can clearly destroy you at any time.

01:14:21.098 --> 01:14:24.851
Lower your shields and allow me
to transport you to my ship.

01:14:25.311 --> 01:14:27.103
And the Enterprise?

01:14:28.814 --> 01:14:32.317
I have little interest
in your quaint vessel, Captain.

01:14:33.277 --> 01:14:35.070
Look at me, Shinzon.

01:14:38.032 --> 01:14:41.534
Your heart, your hands,

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:44.454
your eyes are the same as mine.

01:14:45.206 --> 01:14:49.251
The blood pumping within you,
the raw material is the same.

01:14:49.335 --> 01:14:51.169
We have the same potential.

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:55.257
- That's the past, Captain.
- It can be the future.

01:14:56.008 --> 01:14:57.884
Buried deep within you,

01:14:57.969 --> 01:15:00.095
beneath all the years of pain and anger,

01:15:00.179 --> 01:15:02.681
there is something
that has never been nurtured,

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:06.768
the potential
to make yourself a better man

01:15:06.852 --> 01:15:09.562
and that is what it is to be human.

01:15:09.647 --> 01:15:12.190
To make yourself more than you are.

01:15:15.194 --> 01:15:16.444
Oh, yes.

01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:19.364
I know you.

01:15:21.742 --> 01:15:24.619
There was a time
you looked at the stars

01:15:24.704 --> 01:15:26.913
and dreamed of what might be.

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:30.917
Childish dreams, Captain.

01:15:31.002 --> 01:15:34.504
Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus.

01:15:35.381 --> 01:15:37.716
I am what you see now.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.844
I see more than that.
I see what you could be.

01:15:40.928 --> 01:15:44.264
The man who is Shinzon of Remus
and Jean-Luc Picard

01:15:44.348 --> 01:15:47.726
could never exterminate
the population of an entire planet.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.728
He's better than that.

01:15:50.563 --> 01:15:53.023
He is what his life has made him.

01:15:53.107 --> 01:15:57.277
And what will you do with that life?
Waste it in a blaze of hatred?

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:00.071
There is a better way.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.198
It's too late.

01:16:02.283 --> 01:16:05.994
Never. You still have a choice.
Make the right one now.

01:16:06.078 --> 01:16:10.582
- I can't fight what I am.
- Yes, you can.

01:16:13.919 --> 01:16:16.921
I'll show you my true nature.

01:16:17.423 --> 01:16:19.466
Our nature.

01:16:20.593 --> 01:16:22.093
And as Earth dies, remember:

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:27.098
I will always,
forever be Shinzon of Remus.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.186
And my voice shall echo through time
long after

01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:35.106
yours has faded to a dim memory.

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:59.506
Two ships de-cloaking, sir. Romulan.

01:17:12.019 --> 01:17:13.228
Captain.

01:17:18.442 --> 01:17:21.486
Just when I thought
this couldn't get any worse.

01:17:22.655 --> 01:17:24.447
We are being hailed.

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:27.325
On-screen.

01:17:29.662 --> 01:17:33.581
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
of the warbird Valdore.

01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:35.708
Might we be of assistance?

01:17:37.837 --> 01:17:39.254
Assistance?

01:17:39.338 --> 01:17:42.924
The Empire considers this
a matter of internal security.

01:17:43.509 --> 01:17:45.927
We regret you've become involved.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:51.516
Commander, when this is over,
I owe you a drink.

01:17:52.518 --> 01:17:55.645
Romulan ale, Captain. Let's get to work.

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.522
You heard the lady.

01:17:58.023 --> 01:17:59.357
Let's go to work.

01:18:12.371 --> 01:18:16.499
Mr. Worf, coordinate our attack
with the Valdore Tactical Officer.

01:18:16.584 --> 01:18:18.793
Triangulate all fire
on any shield impacts.

01:18:18.878 --> 01:18:19.961
Aye, sir.

01:18:29.597 --> 01:18:31.514
Aft shields down to 40%.

01:18:31.599 --> 01:18:34.809
Keep our bow on the Scimitar.
Auxiliary power to forward shields.

01:18:34.894 --> 01:18:36.227
Aye, sir.

01:18:45.404 --> 01:18:49.407
Target the flanking warbird.
All forward disruptor banks on my mark.

01:19:09.386 --> 01:19:12.889
- Forward shields down to 10%.
- Bring us about.

01:19:22.316 --> 01:19:26.861
Drop cloak on the aft port quadrant.
Prepare for full emergency stop.

01:19:26.946 --> 01:19:29.113
- What?
- You heard me!

01:19:38.457 --> 01:19:43.169
He's losing his cloak.
Stand by all forward disruptor banks.

01:19:46.257 --> 01:19:48.007
She's almost on us.

01:19:50.344 --> 01:19:51.719
Not yet.

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.476
- Praetor.
- Full stop. Fire!

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:23.001
Restore the aft cloak
and bring us about.

01:20:26.005 --> 01:20:29.215
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait,
Captain.

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:32.510
- You have life support?
- For the moment.

01:20:33.178 --> 01:20:36.180
- But we're dead in the water.
- Understood.

01:20:45.858 --> 01:20:47.692
We're losing structural integrity

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:50.820
on Decks 12 through 17,
sections 4 through 10.

01:20:53.824 --> 01:20:56.117
Emergency Force fields are holding.

01:20:56.201 --> 01:20:59.871
Evacuate those decks.
Re-route field power to forward shields.

01:21:03.334 --> 01:21:05.335
Captain,

01:21:05.419 --> 01:21:07.712
I think I may have a way to find them.

01:21:10.382 --> 01:21:15.011
Prepare for a lateral run,
all starboard disruptors.

01:21:22.436 --> 01:21:23.895
What is it?

01:21:25.064 --> 01:21:26.397
What is it?

01:21:28.525 --> 01:21:29.901
She's here.

01:22:00.349 --> 01:22:02.684
He's resisting me.

01:22:16.073 --> 01:22:17.115
No!

01:22:20.119 --> 01:22:22.453
Remember me?

01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:26.332
Now.

01:22:36.802 --> 01:22:38.052
Fire at will.

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:52.984
Prepare a boarding party.
Bring me Picard.

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:56.487
You.

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.867
Get the cloak back!

01:23:00.951 --> 01:23:05.079
Target all shield coordinates, Beta-3.
All disruptors fire!

01:23:14.006 --> 01:23:17.425
Captain,
we've lost ventral shielding on Deck 29!

01:23:17.509 --> 01:23:19.927
Divert all power and compensate.

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:27.268
- Intruder alert.
- Number One.

01:23:27.352 --> 01:23:30.813
- Let's go.
- Security detail to Deck 29.

01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:52.710
The Romulans fought with honor.

01:23:53.712 --> 01:23:55.379
Yes, they did, Mr. Worf.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.297
Worf, cover me.

01:26:10.015 --> 01:26:12.183
Medical teams to the Bridge.

01:26:28.033 --> 01:26:29.158
Report.

01:26:29.242 --> 01:26:31.869
We have exhausted
our complement of photon torpedoes.

01:26:31.954 --> 01:26:33.788
Phaser banks are down to 4%, sir.

01:26:33.872 --> 01:26:37.291
What if we targeted all our phasers
in a concentrated pattern?

01:26:37.376 --> 01:26:41.963
The Scimitar shields are still at 70%.
It would make no difference, Captain.

01:26:51.473 --> 01:26:53.099
What's he doing?

01:27:04.903 --> 01:27:07.196
He wants to look me in the eye.

01:27:11.868 --> 01:27:13.244
We've got him.

01:27:16.748 --> 01:27:20.292
He thinks he knows exactly
what I'm going to do.

01:27:20.377 --> 01:27:24.005
Geordi, divert all power to the engines.
Take it from life support, if you have to.

01:27:24.089 --> 01:27:26.257
Give me everything you've got.

01:27:29.886 --> 01:27:31.429
Ready, Captain.

01:27:32.305 --> 01:27:34.348
We are being hailed, sir.

01:27:34.433 --> 01:27:37.643
Deanna, stand by. Open a channel.

01:27:39.938 --> 01:27:44.483
- I hope you're still alive, Jean-Luc.
- Yes, I am.

01:27:44.568 --> 01:27:47.278
Don't you think it's time to surrender?

01:27:47.446 --> 01:27:49.780
Why should the rest of your crew
have to die?

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.075
Shinzon, I don't think I ever told you

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.286
about my first Academy evaluation.

01:27:56.496 --> 01:27:59.290
In particular,
I was thought to be extremely

01:28:00.292 --> 01:28:01.834
overconfident.

01:28:02.586 --> 01:28:06.130
Captain, as much as I enjoy
listening to you talk, I really think...

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:12.636
On my mark, Deanna.
All hands, brace for impact.

01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:16.307
Engage.

01:28:35.577 --> 01:28:37.119
Hard to port!

01:30:08.962 --> 01:30:11.005
Divert all power to the engines.

01:30:12.716 --> 01:30:14.341
Full reverse.

01:31:49.187 --> 01:31:50.854
Reconfiguring now.

01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:57.236
Computer, stand by
auto-destruct sequence Omega.

01:31:57.862 --> 01:32:00.114
Recognize voice pattern
Jean-Luc Picard.

01:32:00.198 --> 01:32:03.284
Authorization Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5.

01:32:05.829 --> 01:32:07.871
Auto-destruct is offline.

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:31.729
Disruptors are not functional, sir.

01:32:35.233 --> 01:32:36.942
Deploy the weapon.

01:32:39.571 --> 01:32:41.905
Kill everything on that ship,

01:32:42.907 --> 01:32:45.075
then set a course for Earth.

01:32:45.618 --> 01:32:47.953
We must complete our mission.

01:33:04.804 --> 01:33:06.347
Matrix initiated.

01:33:07.891 --> 01:33:11.810
Sequencing procedure
for thalaron radiation transfer

01:33:11.895 --> 01:33:13.228
activated.

01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:24.031
Some ideals are worth dying for,
aren't they, Jean-Luc?

01:33:37.128 --> 01:33:40.214
Thalaron intermix procedure initiated.

01:33:41.383 --> 01:33:44.968
Deployment of targeting arms
commencing.

01:34:08.034 --> 01:34:10.160
How long until he can fire?

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.751
The targeting sequence should
take about seven minutes, Captain.

01:34:17.836 --> 01:34:20.212
When the targeting arms
are fully deployed,

01:34:20.296 --> 01:34:23.298
the matrix on the Bridge
will relay the thalaron radiation

01:34:23.383 --> 01:34:25.843
to the firing points at their tips.

01:34:25.927 --> 01:34:28.595
No one on the Enterprise will survive.

01:34:33.184 --> 01:34:37.855
- How can he? He'll kill you.
- It's not about me anymore.

01:34:41.192 --> 01:34:44.653
- Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
- I don't think that the transport...

01:34:44.737 --> 01:34:47.072
- That's an order, Commander.
- Sir, allow me to go.

01:34:47.157 --> 01:34:49.450
- Data, this is something I have to do.
- Sir.

01:34:49.534 --> 01:34:51.785
- Data.
- You have the Bridge, Commander.

01:34:52.036 --> 01:34:55.038
Try and put some distance
between you and the Scimitar.

01:34:55.874 --> 01:34:58.375
- Now, Mr. La Forge.
- Aye, sir.

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:11.180
That's it. Transporters are down.

01:35:16.853 --> 01:35:18.854
System is fused.

01:35:18.938 --> 01:35:22.483
Counselor Troi, please assume
command. Geordi, come with me.

01:36:18.498 --> 01:36:22.167
Thalaron intermix level: 30%.

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:51.113
Four minutes to firing sequence.

01:37:31.029 --> 01:37:35.198
Thalaron intermix level: 50%.

01:37:47.503 --> 01:37:50.464
Three minutes to firing sequence.

01:38:10.735 --> 01:38:14.863
Thalaron intermix level: 60%.

01:39:12.547 --> 01:39:15.465
Two minutes to firing sequence.

01:39:38.156 --> 01:39:42.492
Thalaron intermix level: 80%.

01:40:08.436 --> 01:40:10.562
I'm glad we're together now.

01:40:12.899 --> 01:40:14.858
Our destiny is complete.

01:40:26.078 --> 01:40:28.371
One minute to firing sequence.

01:40:31.417 --> 01:40:34.628
Thalaron intermix level completed.

01:40:50.937 --> 01:40:53.688
30 seconds to firing sequence.

01:41:06.828 --> 01:41:08.411
Goodbye.

01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:11.915
Ten, nine, eight,

01:41:12.416 --> 01:41:15.710
seven, six, five,

01:41:16.087 --> 01:41:19.548
four, three, two...

01:41:45.533 --> 01:41:46.616
Data?

01:42:17.648 --> 01:42:18.940
Captain.

01:42:25.323 --> 01:42:26.740
It's Data.

01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:49.262
Captain, we're being hailed.

01:42:50.348 --> 01:42:51.723
On-screen.

01:42:54.602 --> 01:42:56.186
Open a channel.

01:42:57.772 --> 01:43:00.273
This is Commander Donatra
of the Valdore.

01:43:00.358 --> 01:43:04.277
We're dispatching shuttles
with medical personnel and supplies.

01:43:07.031 --> 01:43:08.657
Thank you, Commander.

01:43:08.991 --> 01:43:12.786
You've earned a friend
in the Romulan Empire today, Captain.

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:15.246
I hope, the first of many.

01:43:16.666 --> 01:43:18.166
Valdore out.

01:43:23.172 --> 01:43:27.592
Geordi,
prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals.

01:43:29.804 --> 01:43:33.264
They don't know our procedures.

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:38.812
- Just open the doors.
- I'll take care of it, Captain.

01:43:39.105 --> 01:43:41.523
You have the Bridge, Number One.

01:43:59.041 --> 01:44:00.417
Thank you.

01:44:12.847 --> 01:44:14.556
To absent friends.

01:44:19.478 --> 01:44:20.854
To family.

01:44:40.791 --> 01:44:42.876
First time I saw Data,

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.962
he was leaning against a tree
in the holodeck,

01:44:46.047 --> 01:44:50.091
trying to whistle.
Funniest thing I ever saw.

01:44:51.093 --> 01:44:54.554
No matter what he did,
he couldn't get the tune right.

01:44:56.474 --> 01:44:58.224
What was that song?

01:45:01.687 --> 01:45:03.646
Can't remember the song.

01:45:33.969 --> 01:45:35.053
Come.

01:45:37.473 --> 01:45:40.016
- Will.
- Permission to disembark, sir.

01:45:40.893 --> 01:45:42.185
Granted.

01:45:43.687 --> 01:45:46.689
So, where's the Titan off to?

01:45:46.857 --> 01:45:48.525
The Neutral Zone.

01:45:48.901 --> 01:45:50.693
We're heading up the new task force.

01:45:50.778 --> 01:45:53.655
Apparently,
the Romulans are interested in talking.

01:45:54.031 --> 01:45:56.908
I can't think of a better man for the job.

01:45:57.701 --> 01:46:01.621
If I may, just a word of advice
about your first command?

01:46:01.705 --> 01:46:03.206
Anything.

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:08.169
When your First Officer insists
that you can't go on away missions...

01:46:08.254 --> 01:46:11.673
Ignore him. I intend to.

01:46:17.096 --> 01:46:20.723
Serving with you has been an honor.

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:26.396
The honor was mine, Captain.

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:45.165
I don't know
if all this has made any sense.

01:46:45.249 --> 01:46:48.251
But I wanted you to know
what kind of man he was.

01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:51.921
In his quest to be more like us,

01:46:52.464 --> 01:46:55.592
he helped us to see
what it means to be human.

01:46:58.262 --> 01:46:59.429
My...

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:02.765
My brother was not human.

01:47:05.269 --> 01:47:07.020
No, he wasn't.

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:09.772
But his wonder,

01:47:09.857 --> 01:47:13.818
his curiosity about
every facet of human nature

01:47:13.903 --> 01:47:17.488
allowed all of us to see
the best parts of ourselves.

01:47:17.573 --> 01:47:18.948
He evolved.

01:47:20.409 --> 01:47:22.577
He embraced change

01:47:22.661 --> 01:47:25.914
because he always wanted
to be better than he was.

01:47:29.293 --> 01:47:30.376
I...

01:47:32.755 --> 01:47:34.464
I do not understand.

01:47:39.637 --> 01:47:41.846
Well, I hope someday you will.

01:47:44.433 --> 01:47:47.644
Captain, the warp engines
are ready to go online.

01:47:48.479 --> 01:47:52.148
I'm on my way.
Please inform Commander La Forge.

01:47:56.487 --> 01:47:58.154
We'll talk later.

01:48:00.074 --> 01:48:02.325
Never saw the sun

01:48:04.995 --> 01:48:07.830
Never saw the sun

01:48:10.876 --> 01:48:13.503
Never saw the sun

01:48:15.965 --> 01:48:17.840
Shining so bright

01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:20.510
Shining so bright

01:48:22.388 --> 01:48:24.847
Never saw things

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:31.187
"Going so right."

01:48:31.855 --> 01:48:33.898
Going so right

01:48:34.305 --> 01:48:40.909
