WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.936
(Key rattles)

00:05.739 --> 00:07.439
(Door shuts)

00:07.474 --> 00:09.041
- Hi.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.409
- Hi.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.312
- Um, your agent called.
Do you have any safety pins?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.047
- My agent?

00:15.082 --> 00:17.349
Which one?

00:17.384 --> 00:18.984
- Uh, I think the assistant
said her name was Jennifer?

00:19.019 --> 00:21.220
- Ginnifer? Or Jennifer
with a "G?"

00:21.255 --> 00:22.888
There's more than one!

00:22.923 --> 00:25.057
- They sent you an email.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.292
- Is it a job?

00:26.327 --> 00:28.727
- I don't know, do I look
like Ginnifer?!

00:28.762 --> 00:30.930
- David, your inability
to retain information

00:30.965 --> 00:32.865
that doesn't directly
pertain to you

00:32.900 --> 00:36.635
might actually require
medical attention!

00:36.670 --> 00:39.071
Are they sending a script?

00:39.106 --> 00:41.273
David, there's nothing here
but...

00:41.308 --> 00:43.142
"Hot singles in my area."

00:44.578 --> 00:46.078
No, wait, wait.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.781
David, it's an audition
for a feature film!

00:50.618 --> 00:51.951
- Well, that sounds promising.

00:51.986 --> 00:55.154
- "Attractive and spunky
forty-something female."

00:55.189 --> 00:56.922
In my sleep!

00:56.957 --> 01:00.526
"Respected ornithologist
Dr. Clara Mandrake,"

01:00.561 --> 01:04.029
in the psychological thriller,
'The Crows Have Eyes... Two.'"

01:04.064 --> 01:06.498
It's a sequel; that's good.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.467
It must mean the first one
was a big success.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.935
- I've never heard of it.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.004
- Well, they want me
to put myself on tape.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.405
David, do you still
have that camera?

01:13.440 --> 01:14.740
Go get it, please!

01:14.775 --> 01:16.275
And a drop cloth.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.544
And a ring light.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.412
- I could probably prop my
phone up against some books.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.885
- And so it begins again.

01:28.255 --> 01:32.558
♪ ♪

01:36.296 --> 01:37.529
(Door opens)

01:39.333 --> 01:41.066
- Good morning.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.837
- I'd like to book
some rooms, please.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.573
- Oh, well, that's wonderful.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.009
Good... good.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.845
- Uh, is there a problem?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.847
- Uh no, no problem.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.516
I can certainly handle this.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.686
My associate usually
works the computer,

02:00.721 --> 02:02.388
but uh...

02:02.423 --> 02:03.922
let's get you booked.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.859
- I'd like to book three rooms.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.594
- Three rooms?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.763
Okay...

02:10.798 --> 02:14.333
Now will that be uh, three...
(Chimes)

02:14.368 --> 02:15.901
Separate, uh, bookings?

02:15.936 --> 02:19.004
- You see, there's a conference
over in Elmdale,

02:19.039 --> 02:23.075
and I was hoping to use
the motel as a kind of a...

02:23.110 --> 02:26.912
breakout space to conduct
my own business out of,

02:26.947 --> 02:28.981
for the next two days,
(Computer chimes)

02:29.016 --> 02:30.749
during the afternoons.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.518
(Computer beeps repeatedly)
- Okay, we seem to be...

02:32.553 --> 02:35.487
having a bit of a problem
with the system here,

02:35.522 --> 02:37.456
but not to worry.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.292
- Are you new at this?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.094
- Ish. (Laughs)

02:42.129 --> 02:44.830
- Well, not to complicate
things for you even more,

02:44.865 --> 02:47.332
um, Johnny, but...

02:47.367 --> 02:49.168
I would love if we could
work out some kind

02:49.203 --> 02:51.003
of a discounted deal,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.105
seeing as we're not gonna be
needing the rooms

02:53.140 --> 02:54.907
during the evenings.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.342
- Okay, um... tell you what.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.013
Why don't I go to a fresh...

03:02.416 --> 03:03.916
page here,

03:03.951 --> 03:06.018
and we'll get this done

03:06.053 --> 03:08.320
lickety-split? Okay.

03:08.355 --> 03:12.257
So--
- I would love to pay cash.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.792
- Whew!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.694
Even better.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.265
Moira: From what I understand
it's between me,

03:20.300 --> 03:22.768
and one other actress.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.837
- Congratulations, Mrs. Rose!

03:24.872 --> 03:26.305
Who's the other actress?

03:26.340 --> 03:28.107
- Well, they haven't found her yet.
- Oh.

03:28.142 --> 03:29.541
But if all goes
according to plan,

03:29.576 --> 03:31.243
(Knocks on wood)

03:31.278 --> 03:33.445
they'll be flying me out
for a screen test!

03:33.480 --> 03:36.515
- Moira, I was just
thinking about you!

03:36.550 --> 03:38.250
- Well, thank you.

03:38.285 --> 03:41.086
- What if we switched parts?

03:41.121 --> 03:43.622
- Switch parts?
- For the duet next week.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.891
- Oh Jocelyn, the duet.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.694
I must apologize,

03:48.729 --> 03:51.363
there seems to have been
a change of plans.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.198
- Moira's gonna be in a movie!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.967
(Moira and Twyla laugh)

03:55.002 --> 03:57.269
- A movie?
- Well, (clears throat)

03:57.304 --> 04:01.173
I'm sure you've seen
"The Crows Have Eyes."

04:01.208 --> 04:03.976
This would be the second
in the franchise.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.477
- Wow.
- Mhmm.

04:05.512 --> 04:08.747
- I have never heard of it,
but congratulations.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.149
- Thank you.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.884
- Shame about the duet, though.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.887
Yeah, we were gonna have
a pretty incredible audience

04:14.922 --> 04:16.255
for the performance next week.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.891
Big tour group coming through,
so...

04:20.360 --> 04:21.794
- Then you'll cut the number.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.563
- No, I don't think that's
a possibility, actually.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.235
Twyla, what if you took
Moira's part

04:30.270 --> 04:32.371
for the duet next week?

04:33.841 --> 04:36.441
- (Gasps) I would be honored!

04:37.744 --> 04:39.478
God, it'd be such big
shoes to fill.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.079
- No, Twyla, no.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.981
No deprecatory mocking.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.983
One must champion oneself
and say,

04:45.018 --> 04:46.585
I am ready for this!

04:48.188 --> 04:50.455
Otherwise, the pressure
could be crippling.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.692
- Look at this filth!

04:55.195 --> 04:56.662
- "Community center adds ramp."

04:56.697 --> 04:58.096
- No, this.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.498
He says the comma's a typo,

04:59.533 --> 05:01.066
but it has run that way
three years in a row!

05:01.101 --> 05:03.569
- Who is this person?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.270
He looks like if Ricky Martin
and Mark Consuelos had a baby.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.239
- It's the competition,
and he's selling his body

05:07.274 --> 05:09.441
to get clients.
It's disgusting!

05:09.476 --> 05:11.343
- You could probably take
just as sexy a photo

05:11.378 --> 05:12.744
if you wanted to.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.146
- I could definitely
take just a--

05:14.181 --> 05:15.547
I don't want to.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.983
Let me ask you this question:

05:18.018 --> 05:19.985
Why should the person who is
performing surgery on your pet

05:20.020 --> 05:21.453
have to have a six pack?!

05:21.488 --> 05:23.488
- You have a six pack.
- That's not the point!

05:23.523 --> 05:25.357
And... it's not a full
six yet;

05:25.392 --> 05:27.793
that's why I'm shredding
right now.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.361
- I don't know, it looks like
a pretty smart campaign to me.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.762
- If he wants to sell sex,

05:30.797 --> 05:33.498
then he should just get a job
down at the Dude Cave!

05:33.533 --> 05:35.267
He'd make more money
than being a vet!

05:35.302 --> 05:36.935
- Um, what's the Dude Cave?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.171
- It's the all male strip club
outside of town.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.341
My cousin Dwayne works there;
he drives a corvette.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.809
- Okay...

05:43.844 --> 05:46.411
Listen, you might wanna think
about spicing up

05:46.446 --> 05:47.813
your approach a little bit.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.082
- The bottom line is that
I did not go to med school

05:50.117 --> 05:51.683
just to exploit innocent
puppies

05:51.718 --> 05:53.652
as a cover for my
extreme vanity!

05:53.687 --> 05:55.587
- But people love
extreme vanity!

05:55.622 --> 05:56.989
And they love puppies,

05:57.024 --> 05:58.690
so you have to give them
at least one of the two.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.759
- I don't know.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.562
- Oh! What about the bunnies
that we have up for adoption?

06:03.597 --> 06:05.230
We can set up like,
a little bunny cam

06:05.265 --> 06:07.599
and stream it live
from our clinic.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.234
That is very popular with
people who hate their jobs,

06:09.269 --> 06:11.470
or are in loveless marriages.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.372
- Are those the people
we wanna be targeting?

06:13.407 --> 06:14.706
- Well, it's free marketing,

06:14.741 --> 06:16.108
and you can find little homes

06:16.143 --> 06:18.744
for those little bunnies
that don't have any houses.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.614
- Fine!

06:22.649 --> 06:24.416
But if those bunnies feel
exploited even a little bit,

06:24.451 --> 06:26.151
I am pulling the plug!
- Yes.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.753
Honeypea.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.024
Moira: Okay...

06:32.059 --> 06:34.359
this is really taking me back.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.361
(Coughs)

06:36.396 --> 06:38.130
Okay, David, I'll need you
to count me in.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.831
- Okay, um, from what?

06:39.866 --> 06:41.233
- Start from five,

06:41.268 --> 06:43.435
you leave out the two,
and the one.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.003
- Okay, why?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.838
- Because it's my process.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.275
- Okay. Um...

06:50.310 --> 06:51.710
Five, four...

06:53.780 --> 06:55.514
- One.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.483
Look what you've done!

06:58.518 --> 07:01.153
Look at it lying there,
lifeless.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.356
Yet, in its eyes,

07:04.391 --> 07:06.658
I see darkness.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.529
- It's just a crow,
Mrs. Mandrake.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.097
- Dr. Mandrake.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.465
And you must be
kidding yourself

07:13.500 --> 07:15.200
if you think more
are not coming.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.601
They always do.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.236
They're watching you, Gareth.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.272
The crows have eyes,

07:20.307 --> 07:23.642
and you better not look them
in it.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.778
- Uh, it-it's just a flock
of crows, Dr. Mandrake.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.081
What's the worst
that can happen?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.352
- Oh, you'll see!

07:33.387 --> 07:35.654
And it's not a flock,
my dear boy...

07:35.689 --> 07:37.622
it's a murder.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.960
Yes, I said murder.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.397
Gareth, murder!

07:45.432 --> 07:47.733
- Sorry, um, this is...

07:47.768 --> 07:50.535
just one big rip off
of "The Birds!"

07:50.570 --> 07:52.037
- This is about crows!

07:52.072 --> 07:53.372
It's much more specific!

07:53.407 --> 07:54.740
- And the dialogue!

07:54.775 --> 07:56.408
Uh, "Look, they've taken
Clara!"

07:56.443 --> 07:58.610
"Where are they carrying
her to, Clara?"

07:58.645 --> 08:00.512
Are there two Claras?!

08:00.547 --> 08:01.847
- It's a common name.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.281
- Yeah, the next scene
takes place

08:03.316 --> 08:05.617
in a large bird's nest.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.886
- Rarely is the material
of quality,

08:07.921 --> 08:10.455
the challenge is to lift it
off the page.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.790
And I think part
of the problem, David,

08:11.825 --> 08:13.525
is that I'm getting nothing
from you.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.994
It's like working off a corpse.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.330
- I actually think you do
play off a corpse

08:18.365 --> 08:20.399
in the next scene and,

08:20.434 --> 08:22.501
if I'm being perfectly honest,

08:22.536 --> 08:25.003
this is all playing a bit big.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.640
- Hmph! Big.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.444
- Yeah.
- And would that be a note?

08:32.479 --> 08:35.514
A note, coming from my son?!

08:35.549 --> 08:37.716
Who I carried for almost
a full seven months,

08:37.751 --> 08:40.552
to an actress who has been
short-listed

08:40.587 --> 08:42.954
for more than seven major

08:42.989 --> 08:45.757
made-for-television
motion pictures?

08:47.127 --> 08:51.396
The script is nothing more
than a jumping off point.

08:51.431 --> 08:52.898
- Oh, okay.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.269
- Let's take it again,
I'll count myself in.

08:57.304 --> 09:01.073
Five, four, three, two...
(Camera beeps)

09:04.010 --> 09:05.243
(Door opens)

09:06.680 --> 09:08.613
Johnny: Great news!

09:08.648 --> 09:11.016
Your new partner just booked
three rooms,

09:11.051 --> 09:14.486
before you even got in
this morning.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.455
- Wow.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.590
- Ha!

09:18.625 --> 09:20.792
Three rooms, two days,

09:20.827 --> 09:23.562
"afternoons only, Trish."

09:23.597 --> 09:24.930
What's afternoons only?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.331
- Well, I gave her a discount,

09:26.366 --> 09:28.934
because she's only using
the rooms during the day.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.570
- So you're renting our rooms
by the hour?!

09:31.605 --> 09:33.805
- We haven't had a guest
in four days!

09:33.840 --> 09:35.807
- What are they using
the rooms for?

09:35.842 --> 09:37.242
- Well, she didn't say,

09:37.277 --> 09:39.311
Just conducting her business
out of them.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.947
- Right, and you know
what that means.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.888
- No.
- Yeah.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.723
No, I-I don't believe you.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.024
- Let me guess, this has
something to do

09:53.059 --> 09:54.726
with the accountants'
conference?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.228
- Yes.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.064
- No, no, you're mistaken.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.566
Stevie, she would've disclosed
that information

10:01.601 --> 10:02.901
if that were the case!

10:02.936 --> 10:05.070
- Really?
- No.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.039
But look, if it makes you feel
any better,

10:08.074 --> 10:10.842
we'll go and check it out.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.544
But when it turns out
I'm right,

10:12.579 --> 10:15.080
and it's just a group
of business professionals

10:15.115 --> 10:17.249
decompressing for a few hours,

10:17.284 --> 10:21.786
during a long day at a regional
accountants' conference,

10:21.821 --> 10:24.923
then I expect a full apology.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.025
- You don't hear it,
when you say it like that?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.060
- I hear it a bit.

10:30.597 --> 10:35.734
♪ ♪

10:35.769 --> 10:37.235
(Crickets chirp)

10:37.270 --> 10:39.271
(Door opens)

10:40.907 --> 10:42.374
- Hi.
- Come look at this,

10:42.409 --> 10:43.608
look at the bunnies!

10:45.011 --> 10:47.279
- Ugh... (gasps)

10:47.314 --> 10:48.580
Cute!

10:51.718 --> 10:53.818
This isn't one of those
animal rights viral videos

10:53.853 --> 10:55.253
where the bunnies go through

10:55.288 --> 10:56.688
a meat processor in the end,
is it?

10:56.723 --> 10:58.156
- Ew, no, David.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.992
I set this up to get people
to visit Ted's website.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.227
Poor thing is, like, out of it

11:02.262 --> 11:04.162
when it comes to selling
himself.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.798
There are 200 people
watching this, David!

11:06.833 --> 11:09.000
That's like double your
Instagram followers.

11:09.035 --> 11:12.304
- Okay, my account is private,
thanks.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.572
- Mm-hmm.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.841
- There's Ted.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.577
- Yeah, sometimes he comes
in and out.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.748
- Um...

11:23.783 --> 11:25.784
Ted is taking his clothes off.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.252
- You wish, David.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.188
- No, Ted is getting naked
on your webcam!

11:33.059 --> 11:34.492
- Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

11:34.527 --> 11:37.562
- I emailed our entire client
list about this, David!

11:37.597 --> 11:39.831
I emailed his parents!

11:39.866 --> 11:42.467
- I'm obsessed with this.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.472
This is incredible!

11:50.310 --> 11:51.676
(Gasps)

11:51.711 --> 11:53.111
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

11:57.117 --> 11:59.217
Ted looks good.
- Yeah, he does.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.921
- David, he looks really good.
- Okay, that's gross.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.422
- Okay, so...

12:06.092 --> 12:08.493
(Gasps) David!

12:14.467 --> 12:16.301
- Oh, hi.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.503
Hi. Uh, I and my associate,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.274
just wanted to come by
and check on you,

12:22.309 --> 12:25.510
and see how you're enjoying
your multiple room stay?

12:28.014 --> 12:30.282
- Oh, we're doing just fine,
thank you.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.350
- Good, good, good.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.387
Because we've heard through
the rumor mill that um...

12:35.422 --> 12:39.124
there have been some
unannounced visitors

12:39.159 --> 12:41.526
staying in the rooms
we rented you.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.396
Visitors who may be engaging
in mature,

12:44.431 --> 12:46.498
if not adult activities.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.401
- And?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.437
- And that's something
we didn't discuss.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.340
- Miss, if I were to tell you--

12:55.375 --> 12:56.908
- Oh no, no,
I got it immediately,

12:56.943 --> 12:58.243
and I wasn't even there, so.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.644
- Okay, well unfortunately,

12:59.679 --> 13:02.180
we're gonna have to ask you
to shut it down.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.350
- Oh, you have nothing to worry
about, Mr. Rose.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.085
We're a very high-end
operation,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.788
and very discreet.

13:09.823 --> 13:13.992
Besides, people are making love
in these rooms,

13:14.027 --> 13:15.293
whether they rent by the day,

13:15.328 --> 13:17.429
the week, or the hour.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.099
- Yeah...

13:21.134 --> 13:22.634
Yeah, well...

13:24.070 --> 13:26.538
Point taken.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.839
- Wow.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.778
(Door shuts)

13:33.813 --> 13:35.513
(Light knock on the door)

13:36.950 --> 13:38.583
(Cars rumble)

13:40.387 --> 13:41.686
- Hey, you know,
I've tried to add

13:41.721 --> 13:43.254
an extra half hour
to my morning run,

13:43.289 --> 13:45.123
but my body just isn't
having it.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.525
- Well, you look great.
- Thanks.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.561
- Um, about the bunny cam...

13:49.596 --> 13:51.463
- I know, it's a huge hit!

13:51.498 --> 13:53.365
We've gotten like nine
new customers overnight!

13:53.400 --> 13:54.699
And some of them
don't even have pets,

13:54.734 --> 13:56.167
they just want to discuss
whether or not

13:56.202 --> 13:57.502
they should get a pet.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.604
- Ted, the camera can see you.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.374
- Okay, so should I like,

14:02.409 --> 14:03.708
wave or something, next time?

14:03.743 --> 14:06.077
- Nope, the camera
can see you...

14:07.514 --> 14:09.681
like, after your run.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.951
- Oh.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.258
Oh no, why didn't you tell me
the camera could see me

14:20.293 --> 14:21.760
when I get back from my runs?!

14:21.795 --> 14:22.961
- I just noticed!

14:22.996 --> 14:24.462
Actually, David noticed first
last night,

14:24.497 --> 14:27.098
but that's exactly when
there is a huge spike

14:27.133 --> 14:28.566
in the website.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.669
- I'm worse than Dr. Miguel!
- No, you didn't know!

14:31.704 --> 14:33.471
Although there was a moment
last night,

14:33.506 --> 14:35.473
where it looked like
you might have known,

14:35.508 --> 14:37.342
and you were doing this like,

14:37.377 --> 14:38.710
thing with your hips.
- Alexis!

14:38.745 --> 14:41.012
- No, I know,
of course you didn't know.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.480
Of course!

14:42.515 --> 14:44.749
Um, don't worry, I'm gonna take
it down right now.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.019
- W-Wait.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.823
You said you saw a spike
in the website views?

14:51.858 --> 14:54.559
- People were very concerned
as to whether or not

14:54.594 --> 14:57.195
you would get your pants
on successfully.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.231
- Well...

15:00.266 --> 15:03.234
who's to say that people
weren't watching

15:03.269 --> 15:05.336
for the bunnies?

15:05.371 --> 15:08.373
- I am, that's what I'm saying.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.476
- I feel that until
these guys are adopted,

15:12.846 --> 15:14.379
we can't take it down,
that'd be bad for business,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.448
for the bunnies' sake.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.617
I'll just have to be more
careful next time.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.719
- Um hello, who are you,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.621
and what did you do
with Theodore Mullins?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.390
- Well, what can I say,

15:25.425 --> 15:27.492
sometimes I like to live
dangerously...

15:27.527 --> 15:31.229
while still respecting
my personal boundaries.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.199
- Yes.
(Ted laughs)

15:34.234 --> 15:35.700
Moira: David!

15:38.872 --> 15:40.672
- What is it?

15:40.707 --> 15:42.073
It's an email.
- Mm-hmm!

15:42.108 --> 15:43.508
- Subject line,
"The Crows Have Eyes II."

15:43.543 --> 15:45.310
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

15:45.345 --> 15:47.846
- I don't know, I'd like you
to read it, please.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.147
(David sighs)

15:54.521 --> 15:56.521
- You booked it.
- Ohhhh!

15:56.556 --> 15:58.323
David! I did?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.326
What'd they say about me?

16:01.361 --> 16:02.494
- They need you to sign
the contract!

16:02.529 --> 16:04.028
- Well, that's standard!

16:04.063 --> 16:05.363
What are the terms?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.365
- Ooh, it's filming in Bosnia!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.334
Um, in a city that I don't,

16:09.369 --> 16:10.702
I don't know the name
of the city,

16:10.737 --> 16:12.136
I can't pronounce it,
a lot of consonants.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.838
- I did not know that.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.540
But I've always loved
shooting on location,

16:15.575 --> 16:17.709
it allows one to focus
on the work.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.879
- Hmm, it's being released
in Bosnia,

16:20.914 --> 16:22.447
Croatia,

16:22.482 --> 16:23.815
Herzegovina.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.751
- Before opening
internationally!

16:26.786 --> 16:29.721
- You have to fly
yourself there?

16:29.756 --> 16:31.756
- Mmm, that doesn't
sound right.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.525
- Ooh, accommodation
is covered.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.993
- Thank God!

16:36.930 --> 16:39.797
- You'll be put up with
a local family.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.835
- Close to the set?

16:43.870 --> 16:46.538
- They're paying you scale.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.540
But it'll be in Baltic
currency,

16:48.575 --> 16:49.841
do you want me to keep going?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.809
- No, read to yourself.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.947
- There's a death waiver?!
- Ohh!

16:55.982 --> 16:58.383
You can close the computer. - Yeah, but
we haven't even gotten to the section

16:58.418 --> 16:59.684
on bird safety yet!

16:59.719 --> 17:01.319
- Shut it! Now.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.293
- What if...

17:10.663 --> 17:12.163
- Hmm.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.731
No, thank you.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.467
(Door opens)

17:20.673 --> 17:22.874
- Have a nice rest of the day.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.780
- Hey Johnny, wow!

17:28.815 --> 17:30.648
This place is hopping!

17:30.683 --> 17:32.850
- Yeah, well, it's uh,
it's been a busy week.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.752
- Uh huh, you know,
I gotta tell you,

17:34.787 --> 17:36.187
when I first heard that Stevie

17:36.222 --> 17:37.922
was hitching her wagon
to your cart,

17:37.957 --> 17:39.457
the first thing that came
into my mind was,

17:39.492 --> 17:40.858
whoooa, Nelly,

17:40.893 --> 17:43.628
that horse is in big trouble.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.330
- A convoluted metaphor,
but um--

17:45.365 --> 17:46.998
- But I've gotta say,
you've proven me wrong,

17:47.033 --> 17:49.434
I mean, obviously, you're doing
something right here.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.736
(Door opens)

17:51.771 --> 17:53.071
- Yeah, well, once again,

17:53.106 --> 17:54.672
thanks for coming by, Roland.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.341
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Johnny, look,

17:56.376 --> 17:57.809
I know it makes you
uncomfortable

17:57.844 --> 18:01.012
when somebody gets real
with you,

18:01.047 --> 18:03.948
but could we just have one
minute when I compliment you,

18:03.983 --> 18:06.751
and you don't go all,
ooh, Roland, my generation,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.820
we don't talk about
our feelings.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.389
we keep 'em all -
rawrrr - inside!

18:11.424 --> 18:13.491
- Yeah well, that's not it,
but once again,

18:13.526 --> 18:14.859
thanks for coming by.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.294
- Hey, one of you guys Ken?

18:16.329 --> 18:17.996
- Ken? No.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.230
- Hi.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.966
I'm Roland, Roland Schitt,
mayor.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.002
Roland Schitt.
- Kitty.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.903
- Kitty, how are you?

18:25.938 --> 18:28.740
Are you enjoying your stay
in our town?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.075
- It's been really good, mhmm.
- Oh...

18:31.110 --> 18:32.377
Hmm.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.512
- So Roland, look, why don't we
head down to the office

18:34.547 --> 18:36.781
if we, uh, wanna chat?

18:36.816 --> 18:38.182
- Who's Ken?

18:38.217 --> 18:40.518
- Well, Ken is probably
her husband.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.721
- Uh huh, and she doesn't know
what he looks like?

18:43.756 --> 18:45.623
- Gentlemen.
- Uhhh...

18:47.226 --> 18:48.459
Uh-huh.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.096
- Excuse me.
- You betcha.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.099
(Laughs) Oh, Johnny.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.303
Well, I see why you've had
such a great week.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.773
- Okay, I don't know
what you're implying,

19:01.808 --> 19:03.608
but I don't like your tone.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.076
- Johnny, please.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.011
This little operation has been
on the council's radar

19:07.046 --> 19:08.479
for quite a while now,

19:08.514 --> 19:10.715
and I'm sorry, but that was no
Sunday school teacher

19:10.750 --> 19:12.116
coming outta here!

19:12.151 --> 19:14.252
- Okay, look, this whole
thing was a mistake.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.586
This whole thing!

19:15.621 --> 19:17.121
But I'm working on it,

19:17.156 --> 19:18.990
I'm working to shut it down,
quickly.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.392
- Well, I'm really happy
to hear that,

19:21.427 --> 19:22.760
because I would hate to have
to assert my mayoral authority

19:22.795 --> 19:24.162
in a situation like this, yes?

19:24.197 --> 19:26.998
- Yeah, and nobody wants
to avoid that more than me.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.633
- Good. Okay.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.435
Well, you know what, I'm glad
I helped you fix your, uh,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.704
broken moral compass.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.839
- Well, there's nothing wrong
with my moral compass, but--

19:34.874 --> 19:35.573
- All right, well, why don't we
tell Kitty that?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.341
(Snickers)

19:39.345 --> 19:41.212
(Laughs)

19:41.247 --> 19:43.781
- Ah, I'd love to see that!

19:43.816 --> 19:45.083
- So I was thinking,
for the chorus,

19:45.118 --> 19:46.651
- Yeah?
- we could sway,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.886
like we're actually islands
in the stream.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.455
- Oh yeah, that's good.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.090
- Hi, I'm here!

19:52.125 --> 19:54.959
- Moira, what about
your big movie?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.961
- Oh that, they're still
hounding me,

19:56.996 --> 20:00.031
but I took a moment
to stop and think

20:00.066 --> 20:02.366
about what is really
important in life,

20:02.401 --> 20:05.670
and while the Bosnian Riviera
is a majestic locale,

20:07.206 --> 20:10.174
it can't hold a candle
to singing with you

20:10.209 --> 20:12.243
wonderful working women here,

20:12.278 --> 20:14.178
in our makeshift
rehearsal studio.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.147
- Well, I'm flattered,

20:16.182 --> 20:19.383
but Twyla's been working
on your part for the duet,

20:19.418 --> 20:21.285
and I really don't think
that that would be

20:21.320 --> 20:23.421
in the spirit of things
to take that from her.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.691
- But the song was my idea,
Jocelyn.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.960
John and I made David
to that song,

20:28.995 --> 20:30.495
in Pusitano.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.464
- Hey, why don't we just
show you how we're doing,

20:33.499 --> 20:36.467
and you can offer up
some professional advice,

20:36.502 --> 20:38.369
for now.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.670
- Okay.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.875
