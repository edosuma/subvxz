01:00.194 --> 01:01.462
I noticed a lot of people
wandering out

01:01.462 --> 01:03.131
during the last storm.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.832
We're here to treat patients,
not become them.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.500
Here's one more.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.001
Hi!

01:08.001 --> 01:10.003
How are you this morning?

01:10.003 --> 01:11.239
Uh, great.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.874
I wasn't asking you.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.676
Did you read this?

at the clinic?

01:30.824 --> 01:32.460
What's the point
in even going in?

01:32.460 --> 01:35.496
There's a massive storm
on the clinic's opening day,

01:35.496 --> 01:38.232
I just got Meredith's e-mail
that she's leaving,

01:38.232 --> 01:39.700
and, oh, right,
none of Luna's clothes

01:39.700 --> 01:41.635
fit her any more.

01:41.635 --> 01:45.339
So those are three omens,
all telling me to stay home.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.075
Luckily, women only need
abortions in pleasant weather.

01:48.075 --> 01:51.078
I could put up a sign--

01:51.078 --> 01:53.681
"Come back
when the sun's out."

01:53.681 --> 01:56.350
Okay, you eat.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.719
I'll go find some of
Scout's clothes for Luna.

02:00.221 --> 02:03.123
Get a plate.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.127
What are you
doing here?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.362
I took the day off work
to help you pack.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.164
Where are your
plate protectors?

02:10.164 --> 02:11.565
I mean, I don't know
what those things are.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.634
But I have movers and packers
coming this weekend.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.968
I have said this.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.370
Yes, but will they treat
your things

02:16.370 --> 02:19.006
with as much love
and respect as I will?

02:19.006 --> 02:21.375
I just--
Let me do this, please.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.910
Fine.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.913
Hey, uh, your e-mail
was good, short and sweet.

02:25.913 --> 02:26.914
Efficient.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.516
It needed to be.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.351
I don't have a whole lot
of time this morning,

02:30.351 --> 02:33.354
so if you want to come,
I have a whipple with Nick.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.722
How's he taking
the news?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.557
Uh, we're not
talking about it.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.192
I'm avoiding Winston so that
we don't have to talk

02:38.192 --> 02:39.627
about his whole
switching specialties thing.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.161
So maybe you could stay home
and we could avoid

02:41.161 --> 02:42.496
and pack together.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.499
That actually sounds
amazing, but no.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.335
Bye.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.973
It's fine.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.975
Oh, everything's fine.

02:57.378 --> 03:01.382
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I brought sparkling cider.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.417
I figured this called
for a celebration.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.019
Or not.
Yeah, no, this is serious work.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.821
Forget the cider.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.223
You should've brought
something stronger. Right.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.658
Wilson, we're
not opening yet.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.726
Accreditation hasn't
come through.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.462
Bureaucracy.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.630
This red ribbon might
as well be red tape,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.566
and neither one of 'em
is getting cut today.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.302
It's a national crisis.
We scheduled patients.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.471
I can try to take them
upstairs, pro-bono.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.672
Bless you.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.474
Happy opening day,
everybody!

03:26.474 --> 03:29.042
I brought some
almond croissants to celebrate.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.711
Opening's postponed.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.879
Uh, bureaucracy?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.081
How do you know?
It always is.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.883
There may be
a silver lining.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.319
Bailey, I could use your help
with a sigmoid resection.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.621
And with this storm,
the ER's gonna be packed.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.391
Oh, shut up!

03:46.760 --> 03:50.063
Good morning, Lucas.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.632
I can tell
from your face

03:51.632 --> 03:53.867
that you have not told
anyone the truth.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.503
Actually, yes, I have.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.837
Hmm?
Griffith knows.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.872
How about Kwan
and everyone else?

03:58.872 --> 04:02.209
I-- Well, I've been busy, uh,
studying for this whipple...

04:02.209 --> 04:05.012
...so I-- It's just
been this whole...

04:05.012 --> 04:07.315
And anyway, Dr. Shepherd,

04:07.315 --> 04:11.585
I'll, uh-- I'll get right
on that thing for you.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.954
I'll let Dr. Marsh know
he can reassign the whipple

04:13.954 --> 04:16.724
because you have a... thing.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.566
Stop.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.134
This is over.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.736
Follow me.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.604
Now.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.675
Geez, come on, people.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.916
I'm not really
a to-the-minute guy,

04:42.916 --> 04:44.818
but there is something
called on time here.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.720
Sorry, the storm backed up
traffic from First and Columbia.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.289
I know, I know, but everyone
else got here except for Adams.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.324
Where's Adams?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.659
My fault, Dr. Marsh.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.193
I'm sure you're swamped,

04:53.193 --> 04:57.197
but Dr. Adams has
an announcement to make.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.666
Okay.
Okay, make it fast.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.141
Some of you have gotten
the wrong idea about me,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.578
so I need to clear things up.

05:13.213 --> 05:18.051
Uh, the truth is,
D-Dr. Shepherd is--

05:18.051 --> 05:21.355
her sister's my mom,
so she's my aunt.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.256
I'm a Shepherd.

05:25.859 --> 05:29.162
And yeah, that's it.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.465
Disturbing
on so many levels.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.734
Just to be very clear,
we are not now

05:33.734 --> 05:37.004
and have never been
having sex with each other.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.041
Yeah, that would be really weird
if he's your nephew.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.242
Mm-hmm.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.044
Thank you, Dr. Adams.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.048
Okay, so if you're related
to half the hospital,

05:48.048 --> 05:49.983
do you know why
Grey is deserting us?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.685
She's the reason
this program is running.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.220
I ju-- Should we be
looking for other options?

05:53.220 --> 05:54.855
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Take a seat.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.827
Okay.
About Dr. Grey's news,

05:59.827 --> 06:01.629
you're scared,
that's understandable.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.664
And I want to answer
every question you might have.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.166
But right now, there are
patients about to go into

06:06.166 --> 06:07.835
O.R.s who are
far more concerned

06:07.835 --> 06:09.803
with whether
they're living or dying.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.339
They don't care about the career
moves of individual surgeons.

06:12.339 --> 06:15.342
They don't. So today we're gonna
save lives, okay?

06:15.342 --> 06:17.144
Griffith, Adams,
you're scrubbing in

06:17.144 --> 06:18.712
with me and Grey
on the whipple.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.213
Yasuda, Kwan, Millin,
you're in the pit

06:20.213 --> 06:21.515
with Altman and Schmitt.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.883
Let's go.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.351
Okay.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.656
Okay, hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.492
Take a seat, please, sit.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.528
Surgical excellence,
it takes more than one person.

06:34.528 --> 06:38.031
This program is more
than one person.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.067
<i>You</i> are the program.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.402
It ain't going anywhere.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.904
Okay?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.305
Let's go.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.378
God help us all.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.550
Here I am!
Sorry, weird meeting.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.085
Apparently, even more
people in this place

06:58.085 --> 06:59.352
are related
than I thought.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.954
Let's focus, Yasuda.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.823
Alright,
Ben Warren called ahead

07:02.823 --> 07:04.792
and said we're gonna need a lot
of extra hands on this one.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
That's cryptic.
He say why?

07:06.560 --> 07:10.330
Jonathan Bright, 42-year-old
male, local TV reporter.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.732
Survived a crash
while reporting on the storm,

07:11.732 --> 07:13.801
and the helicopter
was struck by lightning.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.136
Third-degree burns,
possible spinal injury
and neuro deficits.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.404
The bottom of the seat
fractured upon impact

07:17.404 --> 07:19.006
and impaled him
through the right thigh.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.541
We couldn't safely
extricate him from the chair

07:20.541 --> 07:22.075
without risking
further injury.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.011
Is my wife here?
If I'm gonna die,

07:24.011 --> 07:25.178
I really want to
see my wife.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.380
Hi Jonathan.
I'm Dr. Altman.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.582
We are gonna work
very hard to see to it

07:28.582 --> 07:30.017
that you don't die.
Where do you want him?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.885
Altman?
Alright, Trauma three.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.086
Go get us some help.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.022
Okay.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.625
Alright, slowly, slowly.
Nice and easy.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.074
Hey.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.409
Wh-- Uh, why
aren't you at work?

07:56.409 --> 07:57.911
I'm not on
until tonight.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.179
I thought I'd join you
and lend a hand.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.147
Also, I think
you're avoiding me,

08:00.147 --> 08:01.515
so I thought
I'd ruin that plan.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.251
I'm not avoiding you. I...

08:04.251 --> 08:06.687
Um, I-I mean--
I am a little bit.

08:08.455 --> 08:11.358
Um, also, I want to
spend time with the children

08:11.358 --> 08:13.126
who are moving
across country.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.797
I can leave, but I'd rather
stay and talk.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.231
Or, you know,
we don't have to talk.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.734
I can just, uh, help.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.169
I brought peanuts.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.672
Yeah,
help me upstairs.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.040
Alright.
Um, Meredith is purging,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.909
and she is not one
for sentimentality.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.477
Oh, hey, save
what you want now

08:30.477 --> 08:31.879
before she chucks
it all into a dumpster.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.681
Yeah. Hey, Zola.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.482
Uh, yeah?

08:35.482 --> 08:37.350
Zola, we're gonna go
start upstairs in the attic.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.719
Can you keep an eye
on those maniacs?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.053
And, um, stay inside.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.188
The odds of being struck
by lightning

08:41.188 --> 08:42.990
are only 1 in 15,000.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.057
Exactly.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.058
Don't give it a chance.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.830
Okay, Zola,
Bailey, and Ellis.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.164
Is that all of them?

08:51.164 --> 08:52.465
Yes, thank you,
Ms. Hobbes.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.702
Thank you.
No, it's Tessa, please.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.805
Wait, uh, you don't want
an inscription?

08:57.805 --> 09:00.540
I already have some.
We've met before, actually.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.675
My mother used to
take me to see you read

09:01.675 --> 09:03.176
at the Seattle library.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.678
The character of Tessa
is the reason

09:04.678 --> 09:06.580
I wore red sneakers
all through third grade.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.815
Oh.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.017
Uh, Dr. Griffith, please.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.185
Tessa Hobbes, 68,
diagnosed 12 months ago

09:12.185 --> 09:13.787
with chronic pancreatitis.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.388
All medical and endoscopic

09:15.388 --> 09:16.790
attempts at treatment
have been ineffective.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.291
Today, she will undergo
a whipple procedure

09:18.291 --> 09:20.293
to resect the damaged parts
of the pancreas,

09:20.293 --> 09:21.361
and I'm a huge fan, too.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.996
Oh.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.998
Tessa, I do feel it necessary
to reiterate,

09:24.998 --> 09:26.499
this is a very risky surgery.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.668
Well, I have to
live through it.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.170
I still have
a story to tell.

09:30.170 --> 09:34.174
It's tickling my fingers
and the back of my throat.

09:34.174 --> 09:39.980
I even have a title for it--
"Tessa and the Rising Sun."

09:39.980 --> 09:41.314
Sure you don't want
to postpone

09:41.314 --> 09:42.082
the surgery
and write the book?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.550
Oh, gosh no.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.819
I am so sick.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.821
I can't write.
I sleep all day.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.189
I can barely think.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.490
We just want
to make sure

09:50.490 --> 09:53.326
that you're prepared
for every outcome here.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.730
Yeah, I'm prepared
for every outcome.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.466
But my readers are not.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.734
Every year,
for over 40 years,

10:00.734 --> 10:02.335
I've written a Tessa book.

10:02.335 --> 10:08.175
My readers deserve
an end to her story.

10:08.175 --> 10:12.079
You and your kids
deserve an end to her story,

10:12.079 --> 10:15.582
so do your best
to save my life, okay?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.455
I hate
this new board.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.991
Ah, Webber.
I'm getting rid of this.

10:23.991 --> 10:28.061
So I hear this hospital
is in need of a new chief.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.363
Oh, why?
Have someone in mind?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.631
Oh, yeah.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.166
Me.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.869
I need this.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.537
I need to be useful again.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.139
I was chief for
five years.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.573
I-I have the experience
and the skills,

10:40.573 --> 10:42.876
and I will move
mountains for you.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.678
Who could be better?

10:44.678 --> 10:47.014
Someone who doesn't have
a suspended license.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.084
Hunt, this program
has gone through a lot.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.920
We're just now finding
our footing again.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.155
I mean, promoting you...

10:55.155 --> 10:57.657
Hey, you're
a great teacher, Hunt.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.559
Uh, if you need
something to do,

10:59.559 --> 11:02.195
I've been asking all of
the attendings to help Schmitt.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.997
Okay?
Okay.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.867
We need him
out of this chair

11:06.867 --> 11:08.836
in order to assess
his spine fully.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.838
Wait, he's hypotensive.
We need to put in another line.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.173
He may be in neurogenic shock.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.075
Alright, collapsed lungs
on both sides.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.010
He needs bilateral chest tubes.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.812
Okay, it's hard to see,
but it looks like

11:18.812 --> 11:20.881
there's a deformity
in the mid cervical

11:20.881 --> 11:22.382
and high thoracic spine.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.251
The impalement is near
his femoral fracture.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.753
We're gonna need a CT.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.487
Jonathan?
Paola.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.388
Yasuda, I need you
to put in an IO line.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.522
On it.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.024
I'm so sorry
I went up there.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.461
It was awful
and gorgeous and...

11:34.461 --> 11:37.865
then I just
fell straight down.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.366
Why aren't you
getting him out?

11:39.366 --> 11:40.667
We're working on it.
I'm so glad you came.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.035
I didn't know if you'd
make it before I...

11:42.035 --> 11:44.004
Wait!
Wait, is he dying?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.373
We need to cut him
out of this thing.
Please don't let him die.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.475
Hang on. Hang on.
I need everyone to let me ensure

11:48.475 --> 11:50.077
he's getting oxygen
into his lungs

11:50.077 --> 11:51.478
because without it,
he's gonna go into

11:51.478 --> 11:54.414
respiratory arrest before
we can even turn a saw on.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.549
I need a chest tube tray
and someone to page

11:56.549 --> 11:58.318
Dr. Owen Hunt right now!

11:58.318 --> 12:01.554
We are a level one trauma center
in a lightning storm.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.691
You will see gnarly injuries.
You do not have time to gawk.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.692
Well, we probably
won't see anyone

12:05.692 --> 12:06.693
struck by lightning today.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.361
Check your tablet, Kwan.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.897
The patient
intake log disagrees.

12:09.897 --> 12:10.864
Most people who
are struck by lightning

12:10.864 --> 12:12.299
aren't actually hit.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.733
They're standing next
to something that is.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.136
Current enters wires,
pipes, the ground

12:16.136 --> 12:18.371
until a body,
and then boom.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.908
You also don't have time
for random lightning facts.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.542
Hey, Doctor, are you here
for us, the Smiths?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.877
Uh, Heather,
Logan, and Paige?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.345
Yeah, my wife and kids.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.479
Uh, they were
in our backyard,

12:26.479 --> 12:27.981
and, uh,
lightning struck

12:27.981 --> 12:29.416
the basketball hoop, and--
and they got zapped.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.884
Did anyone
lose consciousness?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.485
No, but they were
very disoriented.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.487
I once got
a concussion when a volleyball

12:34.487 --> 12:36.123
hit me in the face,
and it was just like that!

12:36.123 --> 12:37.290
I think the shock
did something

12:37.290 --> 12:38.491
to her hearing.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.293
So now she's
even more annoying.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.328
Um, I have to, um...

12:41.328 --> 12:42.695
Go, Dr. Schmitt.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.131
We've got this.
Excuse me.

12:44.131 --> 12:44.998
Uh, page me
if you need me.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.467
Uh-huh.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.136
Uh, let's get a full set
of labs--

12:49.136 --> 12:51.304
CBC, troponins,
a comprehensive metabolic panel.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.907
Also 12-lead EKGs to check
for arrhythmias.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.675
Wait, wait, what?

12:55.675 --> 12:57.344
Um, most complications happen
within an hour of injury,

12:57.344 --> 12:59.146
but we just want
to be safe.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.513
Okay.
Alright, thank you, Doctor.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.982
Mm-hmm.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.350
Hey, I was gonna
say all that.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.885
Then why didn't you?

13:11.658 --> 13:15.028
Antioxidants for the pancreas,
sugar for energy,

13:15.028 --> 13:19.499
and it's a long surgery,
so we should eat.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.001
Just one second.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.303
What's that?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.638
I made it up to organize
the whipple steps.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.008
It's anatomical designed,
so you start clockwise

13:28.008 --> 13:29.409
with 8:00
with the events--

13:29.409 --> 13:31.544
SMV, Kocher, portal dissection,
bah, bah, bah.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.714
And then counterclockwise
for anastomosis.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.850
Oh.
Tessa's like Seattle royalty.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.351
Man, I grew up
on her stories.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.887
I used to go to her
midnight book releases

13:39.887 --> 13:41.554
with my dad and grandma.

13:41.554 --> 13:46.159
Now I'm part of her story
in a tiny way, but still...

13:50.030 --> 13:53.066
You feel better now
that the secret's out?

13:53.066 --> 13:55.802
Uh...

13:55.802 --> 13:58.538
different, not better.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.442
So... Shepherd,
Shep is your nickname?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.477
Yeah, it's
my middle name.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.578
You want us
to call you that?

14:05.578 --> 14:07.314
No. No.

14:07.314 --> 14:11.651
You know, most people go to work
to avoid their families.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.953
Heard.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.693
Uh, oof, I-I-I should check in
with Marsh.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.561
It's almost time.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.795
Mm-hmm.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.497
You okay?

14:24.497 --> 14:27.367
Oh, yeah, it's just my childhood
on the operating table.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.401
No pressure or anything.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.538
Yeah.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.641
Uh, I'll see you
up there.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.377
Alright.
Alright.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.289
There's a small amount of fluid
in the upper left quadrant.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.058
The CT will give us
a better picture.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.692
Sats back in the 90s.
Alright, let's go over the plan.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.294
I'll hold his head to keep
the cervical spine

14:54.294 --> 14:55.495
in a neutral position.
Link and I will hold

14:55.495 --> 14:57.197
his legs until after
the chair's been detached

14:57.197 --> 14:58.631
to prevent any shift
in the spinal fractures.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.334
Yasuda, help Altman
steady the chest tubes.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.802
Why does it sound like
you've all done this before?

15:02.802 --> 15:04.071
We have. Yep.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.738
I haven't.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.240
Paola, we're gonna need you
to step outside

15:07.240 --> 15:08.341
while we cut him out.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.211
Wait, just one second.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.680
I've been an ass.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.983
I love you.

15:15.983 --> 15:20.820
I gave up my dream for you,
and then I blamed you for it.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.223
And if I live through this,

15:23.223 --> 15:27.727
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.363
Paola, I love you.
Please forgive me.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.069
Alright, yep.
We're good to go.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.071
Okay. Ready?
Let's do this.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.472
Very, very slowly.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.975
We got you.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.748
Hey, uh, have you seen
Dr. Altman?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.383
I'm jumping in down here.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.085
Trauma 3, but she's not
handing out assignments.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.321
Who is?

15:54.321 --> 15:55.955
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.290
Are you here
stealing supplies?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.325
'Cause the clinic
can have them.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.160
No, I'm here to help.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.995
No, I-I said
that I don't need supplies.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.896
Well, you do if you're gonna see
the head lac in bed 6

16:03.896 --> 16:06.666
and the ankle injury
in 9.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.801
Okay, uh, well,
thank you, Dr. Wilson.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.137
I really appreciate
your help.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.638
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.406
Is that supposed
to be sincere?

16:13.406 --> 16:16.009
Yes, but for the rest of
the day, gratitude is implied.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.813
Her pancreatitis formed
a pseudoaneurysm of the GDA.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.050
See? Right there.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.184
So you're gonna have to be
very careful

16:24.184 --> 16:25.518
with the Kocher maneuver.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.620
Right.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.322
You okay?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.857
Yeah.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.226
There's nothing you can do
we can't fix.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.995
Alright?
And you did the work, yeah?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.564
Yeah.
Yeah, so you did the work.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.731
You trust your instincts.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.000
You trust your work.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.535
Okay?

16:42.535 --> 16:44.037
And, Adams,

16:44.037 --> 16:46.573
you're good enough
to make your own name.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.042
Believe me.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.177
Uh, Marsh,
can I have a word?

16:50.177 --> 16:52.079
Yes, please, come in.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.582
If this is about Meredith,
I've already informed

16:55.582 --> 16:57.817
the interns that their program
is in good hands here.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.386
No, it's not about them.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.889
Uh, to put it directly,
should I anticipate

17:02.889 --> 17:04.857
any goodbye e-mails
from you?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.293
Ah. No.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.828
Uh, well

17:08.828 --> 17:10.297
I don't know.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.132
I mean, to be honest,
I've been so busy

17:12.132 --> 17:13.666
with the residency
and my caseload,

17:13.666 --> 17:15.335
I haven't had time
to think about it.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.836
And if I had, I wouldn't
have thought for very long

17:16.836 --> 17:18.638
because trying to think
the right way

17:18.638 --> 17:20.707
to the right answer
with Meredith is...

17:20.707 --> 17:22.542
She's not easy, I know,

17:22.542 --> 17:25.512
but there's also
no one like her.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.514
And when she leaves,
this place will feel it,

17:27.514 --> 17:29.682
so I just need
to make sure that

17:29.682 --> 17:31.351
I'm prepared
across the board.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.485
Understood.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.053
Okay.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.189
Please keep me posted.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.334
Ms. Hobbes, it's time.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.836
Ready?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.671
Sure am. Mm.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.639
Are you?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.874
We all are.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.509
But before I take you...

17:57.677 --> 18:00.147
Oh!

18:00.147 --> 18:02.048
This is a real
collector's item.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.983
Meant a lot to me
growing up.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.386
My childhood was--
I-I grew up without a mom.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.888
And this helped me to--

18:08.888 --> 18:11.558
helped me to see Tessa's life
wasn't perfect either.

18:11.558 --> 18:16.363
Kids need messy stories.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.198
That should be my epitaph.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.366
Except
you're not dying today.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.301
I might.
Let's be honest.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.703
I don't want to,
but I might.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.205
You have another
story to tell.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.973
Dr. Griffith,
don't do that.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.509
I don't do fairy tales,
never have,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.211
so let's not start now.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.649
I tell children
the truth

18:36.649 --> 18:38.585
in a way that helps
them hear it.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.187
Mm-hmm.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.488
And I expect them
to do the same,

18:41.488 --> 18:44.191
even when they're
no longer children.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.726
I do have
another story to tell.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.561
I don't want to die.

18:48.561 --> 18:54.701
I have asked my surgeons
to do their very best.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.837
But I might not make it.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.539
That's the truth.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.341
So...

19:01.341 --> 19:02.909
since this might be
my last signature,

19:02.909 --> 19:05.578
let's make it a good one.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.113
They're ready
for you, Tessa.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.018
Okay.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.554
Here I come.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.394
Hey.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.995
Did you tell Lucas
about the pseudoaneurysm?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.632
Mm-hmm.
He's seen the scans.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.634
I need him to appreciate
everything that could go wrong.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.436
Why? Because
he's Derek's nephew?

19:31.338 --> 19:33.406
Glad I could find out
when everyone else did.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.408
He asked me to keep
his family connection private.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.410
I respected that. Great.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.845
And he knows about
the pseudoaneurysm.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.213
I wasn't gonna
blindside him.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.988
I don't know what to do either.
I want to fight for us.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.891
I want to try,
but every answer feels bad.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.192
Yeah, because there isn't
a good one.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.228
If I ask you to stay,
I'm being a jerk.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.297
And if I follow you,
I'm deserting this class--

19:57.297 --> 19:58.898
your class.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.500
But I haven't asked
you to do

20:00.500 --> 20:01.868
either one of those things.
Yeah, exactly.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.703
You-- You haven't asked me to
do anything. Nothing.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.171
You don't consider me
part of your life.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.873
Of course you're
part of my life.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.308
You took the Boston job
without even talking--

20:08.308 --> 20:10.410
without even thinking
of talking to me.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.211
And I get it.
I do, I get it.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.014
Your family needs it,
but it sucks.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.716
It sucks, and I'm
being supportive

20:16.716 --> 20:18.385
because there is
no other answer.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.287
Well, maybe there is.
What do you want?

20:20.287 --> 20:21.621
I just--
I want to do this surgery.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.055
It's one thing
we can fix.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.392
That's all I want
from you right now.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.163
Yeah, she has a perforated
eardrum which explains

20:31.163 --> 20:32.665
the hearing loss.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.033
Uh, it's common in
lightning strike victims.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.635
It should
heal on its own.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.637
Am I okay?!

20:37.637 --> 20:39.672
Can I keep reading?!

20:39.672 --> 20:42.475
Will he be
able to walk?

20:42.475 --> 20:44.544
Uh, it's important
he does.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.980
This might hurt, but it helps
prevent infections, no crutches.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.517
I just got new Jordans.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.184
It's like the lightning
wanted my sneakers.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.820
It wanted your sweat.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.355
That's why you've got burns
in your armpits

20:55.355 --> 20:56.789
and the backs
of your knees,

20:56.789 --> 20:58.358
on your elbows,
and on your feet.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.059
It turned it to steam.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.228
So his feet were sweating
so much his shoes exploded?

21:02.228 --> 21:04.664
Mom!
Will that happen to me?!

21:04.664 --> 21:07.734
No, no, no, no.
You have something different!

21:12.905 --> 21:14.206
Jonathan,
you okay?

21:14.206 --> 21:15.742
The noise...
We're almost there.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.544
Once he's detached,
we need to use the board

21:17.544 --> 21:19.011
to keep him flat
and level.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.747
And everyone moves
at the same time, okay?

21:20.747 --> 21:23.416
Hold him tight, and we move
at the same time.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.285
Remember, any movement
of his spine could paralyze him.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.954
Let's get ready.
He's almost through.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.158
Get in here, Julius.
Let's go.

21:32.158 --> 21:36.863
Alright, on my count--
one, two, three.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.197
Wait, watch the lines.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.733
Slow, slow,
keep it straight.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.536
Get this out of here.
Okay, nice work.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.904
Let's get him up to CT.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.373
Damn it.
He's lost his airway.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.341
Someone get me
an intubation tray right now!

21:50.076 --> 21:50.943
Come on, Jonathan.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.918
Alright.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.191
Oh, wow!

22:05.191 --> 22:07.560
I haven't seen this
in years.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.662
Remember I told you
about this?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.531
This is the Post-It note
that Meredith and Derek

22:11.531 --> 22:12.665
wrote their vows on.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.000
Oh, yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.169
Ugh, it's one of
my favorite stories.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.972
Ugh. I'm going to
hold on to this.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.074
No way I'm letting her
accidentally throw it away.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.312
I feel weird.

22:26.312 --> 22:29.982
It's like... I know that
I'm going to miss Meredith,

22:29.982 --> 22:32.619
and I'll probably be diving
into a pint of Rum Raisin

22:32.619 --> 22:36.322
very soon, but right now,
I'm just excited.

22:36.322 --> 22:40.560
For Meredith's next chapter
and for Zola.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.796
Yeah, well, um, as long as
we're on new chapters,

22:43.796 --> 22:45.364
I did some research.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.133
Turns out Grey-Sloan
has a fellowship

22:47.133 --> 22:49.368
for vascular surgery.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.203
And I don't want this
to turn into a fight--

22:51.203 --> 22:52.805
Me neither.
Maybe we can revisit it

22:52.805 --> 22:55.241
after Meredith has moved
and things calm down.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.643
I'm filling out
the application.

22:56.643 --> 22:59.011
Nick and Teddy gave me references,

22:59.011 --> 23:01.514
and, actually, it looks
really promising.

23:02.248 --> 23:05.485
Okay, sure.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.119
For now.
For now?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.688
What is that supposed to mean?
It means, honestly,

23:08.688 --> 23:10.322
I think you're going
to change your mind.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.626
You've worked extremely
hard in cardio,

23:13.626 --> 23:15.628
and I know that the last
few months have been rough--

23:15.628 --> 23:17.530
Maggie, would you stop
for one second, please?

23:17.530 --> 23:19.466
We just got the program
back up and running,

23:19.466 --> 23:21.333
and it's really not an ideal
time to find a replacement.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.003
For you. It's not
an ideal time for <i>you.</i>

23:24.003 --> 23:25.404
What about me?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.874
What about us?

23:28.741 --> 23:32.411
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Dr. Dahanne to the ER.
Dr. Colette Dahanne to the ER.</i>

23:32.411 --> 23:34.080
Is he...

23:34.080 --> 23:35.548
He's on his
way to surgery.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.485
We had to put in a breathing
tube, but he is stable.

23:40.453 --> 23:43.456
God, that man is not capable
of letting me rest easy.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.692
He turned down being
a war correspondent for me.

23:45.692 --> 23:49.361
That was his dream.

23:49.361 --> 23:54.467
He wanted to risk his life
every day in a literal war zone,

23:54.467 --> 23:57.670
and I wanted him to not
do that because I just--

23:57.670 --> 23:59.906
I just want to be able
to breathe.

23:59.906 --> 24:03.409
And then he goes up
in a lightning storm.

24:03.409 --> 24:06.546
I don't know what I'll do
if he doesn't make it.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.516
And if he does make it,
I think I'm gonna kill him.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.651
Paola, we are gonna do
everything we can.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.352
And we'll keep
you updated.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.154
Okay.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.628
Okay, I'm going to start mobilizing

24:21.628 --> 24:22.995
the ligament of Treitz.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.130
I can take it.
It's okay, I got it.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.232
I'm right here.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.300
Adams, why don't you
mobilize it for us?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.570
Right angle.
W-- Is he ready for that?

24:30.570 --> 24:33.540
Dissect right in between
my right angle.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.142
Don't go deeper
than what I show you, yes.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.344
And, Griffith, why do we
dissect the ligament?

24:38.344 --> 24:39.912
To give better mobility
to the duodenum.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.914
Correct. Okay.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.183
Okay, what's next?

24:44.183 --> 24:46.519
The Kocher maneuver.
You keep this up,
you can do the chole.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.054
Okay, well,
when we get to that.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.723
Yes. Not yet. Obviously.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.792
Okay.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.699
Hey. Can you see if
Mr. Vizcaino's scans are--

24:59.699 --> 25:01.333
Are you shopping?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.169
Yeah. Luna's outgrown everything.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.172
Oh, you should see her.
She is huge!

25:06.172 --> 25:08.074
Yeah.
She's gigantic.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.509
Just like our backlog
of patients in the ER.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.978
I just need five minutes.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.080
Is Luna cold? No.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.082
Is she naked? No.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.184
Is she suffering? No.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.552
But you know who is?

25:19.552 --> 25:21.353
Ms. McGregor in bed four.

25:21.353 --> 25:24.023
No.
No, what?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.693
No, you're not gonna let
the tiny bit of power

25:26.693 --> 25:29.395
you've had for five minutes
go to your head.

25:29.395 --> 25:32.298
You're chief resident?
Ooh, congratulations.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.001
Guess what?
You're still a resident.

25:35.001 --> 25:39.572
And in the world of general
surgery, I'm still an attending.

25:39.572 --> 25:43.810
I can do surgeries by myself.
Can you?

25:43.810 --> 25:46.145
Didn't think so.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.047
I'm down here helping you
out of the kindness

25:48.047 --> 25:50.082
of my warm,
fuzzy little heart.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.751
Mm.
So you can say it.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.187
Thank you.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.056
Gratitude is implied
for the rest of the day.

26:03.162 --> 26:06.899
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Dr. Williams to Peds ICU.
Dr. Cody Williams to Peds ICU.</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:08.567
Uh, I need to show you
something on a patient.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.169
Can you take a look?

26:10.169 --> 26:13.505
Dr. Kwan, are you asking me
for a consult?

26:13.505 --> 26:15.007
No.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.512
I already
told him it's jewelry.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.214
Thank you, Heather,
I know it's jewelry,

26:22.214 --> 26:23.983
but we just need some more
details on why it's--

26:23.983 --> 26:25.551
Well, that's bronze.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.357
It's copper now,
but the jewelry was bronze.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.292
Bronze is just copper
and tin together,

26:33.292 --> 26:36.228
and tin has a lower
burning temperature.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.964
So the tin vaporized,
and the copper

26:37.964 --> 26:39.866
embedded itself in your skin,

26:39.866 --> 26:42.735
so you just clean with
chlorhexidine and then debride.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.572
Good consult.

26:46.572 --> 26:49.642
I'll be right over there
if you get stumped again.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.050
What did the CT find?

26:58.050 --> 27:00.186
Unilateral facet
fracture at C3

27:00.186 --> 27:02.154
and a compression
fracture at T5.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.156
There's also
an epidural hematoma.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.625
I will decompress the spinal
cord and stabilize

27:06.625 --> 27:08.460
the spine as fast as I can.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.462
I saw extrav from the femoral
artery on the imaging.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.531
Alright, I'll help you
with the vascular repair,

27:12.531 --> 27:14.801
and stand by in case
there's abdominal bleeding.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.568
Dr. Shepherd, um,
can I assist you

27:16.568 --> 27:17.870
on the decompression
and fusion?

27:17.870 --> 27:20.006
Sure.
Stand over there.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.640
But I-I can't reach
the field from here.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.309
I know.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.844
Jonathan needs
an extremely delicate

27:24.844 --> 27:26.512
and complicated procedure.

27:26.512 --> 27:29.081
You're most useful
if you don't touch anything.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.483
It's been a dramatic case,
Yasuda. You're doing great.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.919
Ten blade.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.990
Adams?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.191
Uh, what'd I do?

27:39.191 --> 27:41.027
Nothing.
That's just the problem.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.628
You have to follow me.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.563
I cannot work if I cannot
visualize the field.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.565
Okay, on it.
Don't worry about

27:46.565 --> 27:48.000
what happened this morning.
None of that matters in here.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.169
In here, it's perfect.
Okay?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.170
Okay.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.872
Where are we?

27:52.872 --> 27:55.407
Uh, 10 o'clock.
Still on the Kocher maneuver.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.476
Kocher maneuver.
Which is what?

27:57.476 --> 28:00.046
Mobilizing the duodenum and
pancreatic head off of the IVC.

Yeah, you don't
have to do this.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.899

the portal vein, Dr. Marsh?
I can.

aorta, and it's over.

Griffith, step in, please.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.045
It's okay.
Where am I, Griffith?

28:33.045 --> 28:34.747
You've dissected
to the left lateral border

28:34.747 --> 28:37.049

Good. Let's go.

Yes.
No. No! No!

is just Blue

my mother got sick,
