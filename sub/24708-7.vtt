TED:
You gotta understand
that a lot of girls...

12:59.570 --> 13:01.447
think Carey's like God
or something.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.116
You know?
They've got these
huge crushes on him.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.744
-They want
to make him happy.
-So this was Carey's idea?

13:06.744 --> 13:09.371
Let her make him happy
having sex with you guys?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.916
No, that's not what I mean.
Making him happy
was her idea.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.751
(knocking)

13:17.171 --> 13:20.174
-Dad. This is nuts.
-It's all right, son.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.676
You know Detective Sipowicz.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.845
Yeah, you were a witness
in a homicide I worked.

13:24.845 --> 13:28.682
-That shooting
at the coffee shop.
-That's right.

13:28.682 --> 13:32.228
This girl has said some
completely wrong things.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.271
You're saying
nothing happened
between you and her?

13:34.271 --> 13:36.482
Son, I want you to speak
very slowly and carefully--

13:36.482 --> 13:39.151
step by step--
what went on.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.945
Very slowly.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.907
This girl hangs out
at Janie's Java every day.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.326
She tried to get Carey
to pick her up.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.161
We're talking about Annette,
who's borderline retarded.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.955
You didn't know
she was retarded?

13:50.955 --> 13:54.375
Dad, this girl is completely
developed. She's got
a huge crush on Carey.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.753
She goes to a public school.
I couldn't tell if
she's retarded.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.798
MANOS: So did you go
with Carey or something
after this girl picked him up?

14:00.798 --> 14:03.592
Carey had a credit card
and we went to a hotel
to party.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.761
See, this is what I don't like
about this school.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.556
Great credentials
on college admissions.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.516
I don't like
the sense of values.
Bunch of overprivileged kids.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.810
How about letting Ted
tell what happened?

14:12.810 --> 14:15.521
You weren't hiding
under a table, were you, Ted?

14:21.485 --> 14:23.070
We went up to the room,

14:23.070 --> 14:25.406
and we were drinking.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.617
Oh, that we're gonna
talk about when
we get home.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.996
I guess she was a little loaded,
but, you know, we were all
kind of loaded,

14:31.996 --> 14:37.626
and, uh, then she
started taking turns
on the guys.

14:37.626 --> 14:41.088
-That's what she was doing.
-And you were resisting
with all your might.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.466
-He's trying to be cooperative.
-Did the girl ever say,
"I don't want to do this"?

14:44.466 --> 14:48.137
-Never showed any reluctance?
-No, she didn't.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.055
This girl went home
and locked herself
in her bedroom,

14:50.055 --> 14:52.683
and put herself
in all kinds of trouble
with her mother...

14:52.683 --> 14:55.603
being ashamed and trying
to hide what happened.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.897
That's 'cause she didn't have
any problem with it?

14:57.897 --> 15:02.693
Oh, what's the indication here,
besides what she's saying--
This happened against her will.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.947
-Are there bruises on this girl?
-Maybe she had a problem
with it after she sobered up.

15:06.947 --> 15:10.868
Four of you make
her have oral sex,
and that was fun for her?

15:10.868 --> 15:12.912
Let's not pretend
it's never happened.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.413
Why don't you
keep your mouth shut?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.711
-Who were the other two guys?
-Sam Tucker and Johnny Korth.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.713
And they're gonna
give us the same story?

15:22.713 --> 15:26.425
Look, I am sorry
that she is upset.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.469
If I had any idea
that she had a problem
with it,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.013
believe me, it never
would have happened.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.891
You know, maybe
I was insensitive,
not realizing...

15:33.891 --> 15:36.894
-she might have a problem
with it later, but--
-Aw, you're a phony bastard.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.189
-That's it.
-Reminds me of that TV kiss-ass
on that Leave It To Beaver.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.399
-All right, Detective.
-This is baseless,

15:42.399 --> 15:44.777
and if anyone tries to make
capital out of the fact
that he was cooperative,

15:44.777 --> 15:47.905
-I'm coming after him.
-We appreciate
your cooperation.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.782
Sure.

16:08.008 --> 16:11.303
FANCY: What did he say?
-Oh, she had a big
crush on him.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.681
He said she liked to party.
Everyone gets drunk.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.892

-Only thing from that hotel,
floor maid saw...

sneaking her up shows them
having a guilty mind.

that was her idea.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.547
in the interview room,
Andy, huh?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.927
Yeah, that's just
what I want to do.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.597
All right, why don't we
go on down the hall here
and get a little exercise?

37:46.597 --> 37:48.599
What do you mean by that?

37:48.599 --> 37:51.060
Nothin'. Come on.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.533
Mrs. Morris.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.535
Did you arrest them boys?

38:07.535 --> 38:10.830
-Not as yet, no.
-They're not gonna
be arrested?

38:10.830 --> 38:14.959
I don't think the D.A.
has made that final decision.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.962
I called a lawyer.
He said I might
have a lawsuit.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.048
Might have civil remedies.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.634
Well, those people
do have deep pockets,

38:23.634 --> 38:25.886
and they don't like publicity.

38:25.886 --> 38:29.432
I told him it might have
been my voice made her jump.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.310
Why don't you come on
and sit over here,
all right?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.562
I'll get you something
to drink.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.648
She left her doll someplace.
Do you know if she
left it here?

38:37.648 --> 38:41.110
-Well, we were all
in the coffee room before.
-Let me go look for it.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.612
I told her
to keep it at home.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.406
Come on, come on.
Sit down with me for a second.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.452
Elevator's busted.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.997
Maybe you should think about
staying somewhere else tonight.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.291
She asked if
she could live with
the kindergarten teacher,

38:55.291 --> 38:58.294
and then after
went up on the roof
when she couldn't.

38:58.294 --> 39:02.423
I was there when Mrs. Beachum
was telling you.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.675
I said that she shouldn't
take it on herself.

39:04.675 --> 39:08.346
I mean, if anything,
it was my voice and--

39:11.724 --> 39:14.143
What those boys did to her.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.646
My screaming.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.691
Uh, I don't find it just now.

39:20.691 --> 39:26.197
Okay.
We'll keep looking for it
and, uh,

39:26.197 --> 39:28.616
we'll keep you posted,
Mrs. Morris.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.618
I'm so tired.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.247
Elevator's busted.

39:37.416 --> 39:42.129
Mrs. Morris, I'd really
like you to think if there's
someone you could stay with.

39:42.129 --> 39:44.215
I was with her.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.808
Poor woman.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.937
So what was this
beef about in the park?

39:57.937 --> 40:00.272
Jimmy went off on the guy
for absolutely no reason.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.900
I got it stopped.
I called 911.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.486
I'm sick about it.
He makes me sick.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.320
Night.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.030
-Night, Greg.
-Night.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.241
You know you gotta
get off of this.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.577
I'm just getting to him.
He's up to something bad.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.371
Me and Andy--
We can collar him
off of beating this guy.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.207
With his sheet we're
looking at a pound.
We could flip him off that.

40:18.207 --> 40:21.127
-He'd never flip.
-Oh, no, huh? Jimmy wouldn't?

40:22.837 --> 40:26.465
I don't need you criticizing me
when I'm just looking
for a friendly voice.

40:26.465 --> 40:29.718
How was I
criticizing you, Diane?
I'm saying it's a way out.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.971
Maybe you're just
too close to see it.

40:31.971 --> 40:34.098
You know, you want to talk
about your problems,
but not no solutions.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.809
You can really sound
like an old woman sometimes.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.186
Oh, yeah, huh?

40:39.186 --> 40:42.398
Well, you know what?
Here's an old woman
telling you to kiss his ass.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.652
-Hey.
-Hi.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.239
Hey.

41:04.753 --> 41:06.172
How you doing?

41:07.715 --> 41:10.134
Lousy case.
Woman lost her daughter.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.429
That was her
going down the stairs?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.848
Andy lost his boy last year,
didn't he?

41:18.642 --> 41:20.060
Y-You got kids?

41:20.060 --> 41:22.188
Two boys.
Their dad's got 'em
this week.

41:22.188 --> 41:25.149
I'm doing four-bys
so I don't miss them so much.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.195
God spare me ever knowing
what that's like.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.992
-You want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

41:34.992 --> 41:38.829
Yeah, uh, I don't either.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.583
(chuckles)
You got kids?

41:44.502 --> 41:47.546
No. Not yet.

No. She's gone.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.427
There he is.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.431
Is he making that goofy look
he started making?

42:39.431 --> 42:41.183
No, not right now.

42:41.183 --> 42:45.896
Remember that Dave Garroway?
That's who he looks like
when he makes that expression.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.065
You do not look
like Dave Garroway, Theo.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.526
You look like J. Fred Muggs.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.449
Maury Abrams asked me
to try the Suarez case.

42:57.449 --> 43:01.036
-When did you piss him off?
-It's supposed to be
a compliment.

43:01.036 --> 43:03.330
Everybody in my office
had their hands raised
for that case.

43:03.330 --> 43:07.001
-You tell me who's right
in that mess.
-Well, not Eddie Suarez.

43:07.001 --> 43:10.296
How about those dozen
hooked-up guys
he's standing in for?

43:10.296 --> 43:13.382
Well, maybe if he's
convicted he'll flip.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.801
Sylvia, these guys
put a package together
and Suarez signed on.

43:15.801 --> 43:18.053
Nobody's gonna flip.

43:18.053 --> 43:21.765
When I was talking
to those kids today...

43:21.765 --> 43:24.560
I got this empty feeling.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.854
I knew that nothing
I said was gonna
make any difference...

43:26.854 --> 43:29.106
to anyone in that room.

43:29.106 --> 43:32.026
And since I've been back,
I'll be running a plea
agreement past Maury,

43:32.026 --> 43:34.695
or deciding whether or not
we should take a case,

43:36.071 --> 43:38.240
and suddenly I will get
this feeling...

43:38.240 --> 43:40.409
that I should be back here,
with Theo--

43:40.409 --> 43:43.996
Like I'm
in the wrong room.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.957
Sylvia, if you wanna quit,
I could make enough.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.001
I can get
security work.
No problem.

43:49.001 --> 43:52.796
But then I think,
if nobody goes into
that room with those kids--

43:52.796 --> 43:55.382
me or the lieutenant or Bobby--

43:55.382 --> 43:58.385
there's just that clown
councilman in there
with them.

43:58.385 --> 44:01.764
-Then everybody gets
what they deserve.
-(whimpers)

44:01.764 --> 44:04.433
-Ah.
-Hey.

44:04.433 --> 44:06.435
He's gonna
sleep good tonight.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.687
Sure.
