I've longed for this day.

11:05.698 --> 11:09.930
No, Stan. Terrorists have smuggled uranium
in a shipment of Egyptian artwork.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.936

You mean Al-Qaeda?

11:12.038 --> 11:16.168
Al-Qaeda? Please! Al-Qaeda wishes
they could cater these guys' parties.

11:16.275 --> 11:19.574
We have to break into the museum
and get the uranium before they do.

You and I could be so happy together.

No, ma'am.
We're from the F.B.I.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.730

- Is it this man?

For a minute, I thought
you were describing my father-in-law.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.615
But he doesn't have a mustache.

I was destined for greatness until you
tricked me into having this loving family...

to a life of mediocrity.
