01:14.583 --> 01:16.375
When the primal chaos

01:16.458 --> 01:18.167
was first differentiated,

01:18.875 --> 01:20.250
the light and clear qi

01:20.333 --> 01:22.042
ascended to be the sky

01:22.792 --> 01:24.375
while the heavy and turbid qi

01:24.458 --> 01:27.042
- descended to be the earth...
- Stop.

01:27.125 --> 01:28.125
I don't get it.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.083
That is,

01:32.167 --> 01:34.667
when heaven and earth
were first separated,

01:35.750 --> 01:37.833
the first demon was born.

01:38.542 --> 01:39.417
His name was

01:39.500 --> 01:40.917
primordium.

01:41.625 --> 01:42.500
He was

01:42.583 --> 01:44.625
the ancestor of myriad demons.

01:45.458 --> 01:47.125
Primordium was almighty

01:47.208 --> 01:49.292
as the progenitor of demons.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.042
He sought to rule the three realms.

01:51.125 --> 01:53.000
The bodhisattvas could not subdue him.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.125
All the heavenly generals

01:55.208 --> 01:56.333
and daluo golden immortals

01:56.417 --> 01:59.500
were utterly defeated by him.

02:02.917 --> 02:04.292
Eventually,

02:04.833 --> 02:07.833
a disciple of Buddha

02:07.917 --> 02:10.458
exerted all his qi energy

02:11.000 --> 02:13.083
to seal primordium

02:14.833 --> 02:17.167
once and for all

02:17.250 --> 02:20.542
into the darkest
and coldest reaches of the earth.

02:23.667 --> 02:24.667
Well done.

02:24.708 --> 02:25.708
The origin of demons

02:28.625 --> 02:29.542
is that all?

02:29.625 --> 02:30.625
That's all.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.000
It's just another cooked-up tale.

02:33.083 --> 02:35.043
I could say I am
the father of the great ancestor!

02:35.708 --> 02:36.792
Bajie,

02:36.875 --> 02:38.475
don't curse ancestors, not even a demon.

02:39.708 --> 02:40.583
Then tell me.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.542
What is so great about this primordium?

02:43.458 --> 02:44.458
According to this book,

02:44.542 --> 02:46.708
wherever primordium set foot,

02:46.792 --> 02:48.042
no life remained.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.208
He could even change any living thing

02:50.292 --> 02:51.917
into a demon.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.500
Do you actually believe that?

02:53.583 --> 02:54.417
The book even says

02:54.500 --> 02:56.292
great sage equaling heaven
is all-powerful.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.167
Yet, the monkey is now one of us

02:58.250 --> 02:59.542
on a pilgrimage for scriptures.

03:01.292 --> 03:02.833
That's my brochure!

03:02.917 --> 03:04.208
My brother, you're never sure.

03:04.292 --> 03:05.958
Against myriad worldly thoughts,

03:06.625 --> 03:08.375
stick with our heart chakra.

03:09.375 --> 03:11.083
If we don't understand fully,

03:11.167 --> 03:13.125
resort to zen quotes.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.000
With Buddha in mind,

03:16.375 --> 03:18.250
we will see all sentient beings.

03:20.708 --> 03:21.958
My dearest wukong,

03:22.750 --> 03:24.750
when are you coming back?

03:34.542 --> 03:36.458
What is with this melancholy, master?

03:36.542 --> 03:38.208
Why are you crying?

03:38.292 --> 03:39.417
Seeing you heartbroken,

03:39.500 --> 03:42.667
I also feel sad.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.583
Master, I'm so pathetic.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.167
My tummy rumbled again.

03:51.958 --> 03:54.083
Bajie, it was me.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.000
I'm starving.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.667
It's that shitty monkey's fault.

03:58.750 --> 03:59.750
Where did he go?

03:59.792 --> 04:01.542
Master is so hungry that he cried!

04:03.500 --> 04:04.792
I shed a tear

04:04.875 --> 04:06.667
for this world.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.708
What the...

04:10.208 --> 04:11.500
Bajie,

04:11.583 --> 04:13.708
monks should not ingratiate themselves

04:13.792 --> 04:15.292
or speak vulgarly.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.625
No, I mean that whatever the tear is for,

04:18.667 --> 04:20.083
I will wipe it.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.792
Cool as usual.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.583
This shitty monkey

05:10.667 --> 05:11.833
never does anything good.

05:11.917 --> 05:13.167
Did you make such a fuss

05:13.250 --> 05:14.667
only to bring back a bowl of water?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.833
Shut it.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.792
My entrance must always be cool.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.000
Master!

05:24.083 --> 05:27.000
Master, this monkey always
causes trouble like a demon

05:27.083 --> 05:28.417
because you spoil him.

05:28.917 --> 05:29.917
Bajie,

05:30.542 --> 05:32.262
all sentient beings dwell
in the ten worlds,

05:32.292 --> 05:33.892
which include the six realms of rebirth.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.397
There are tens of millions of demons.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.208
However,

05:37.292 --> 05:38.958
what exactly is a demon?

06:06.750 --> 06:08.250
The book says

06:08.333 --> 06:10.792
that all things endowed
have their own soul.

06:11.625 --> 06:12.500
Yet,

06:12.583 --> 06:14.708
we demons have never had a proper soul.

06:21.000 --> 06:21.833
Master,

06:21.917 --> 06:23.417
once we have acquired the scriptures,

06:23.500 --> 06:25.083
will we have a soul?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.208
Wujing,

06:26.708 --> 06:28.583
when you think it is there,

06:28.667 --> 06:30.583
it will be there.

06:36.292 --> 06:37.292
A soul?

06:37.750 --> 06:38.917
It's not worth a shit.

07:06.542 --> 07:10.833
Wuzhuang temple

07:17.125 --> 07:18.917
My goodness!

07:19.000 --> 07:20.208
How sweet and dewy

07:20.292 --> 07:21.625
these patronesses are!

07:21.708 --> 07:22.792
Look!

07:24.708 --> 07:26.308
Are you from the great tang in the east?

07:26.375 --> 07:28.125
The ones on a pilgrimage to the west?

07:29.833 --> 07:31.042
They are actually males.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.458
Astute observation, children.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.208
Exactly.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.708
My Buddhist name is xuanzang.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.250
Come with us.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.625
This must be a well-to-do family.

07:59.417 --> 08:00.417
Sumptuous.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.333
Children, who is your master?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.292
Our master's taoist name is zhenyuanzi.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.500
The primeval lord of heaven
invited him to a banquet.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.583
So it's great immortal zhenyuan.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.250
Remarkable.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.792
Try our vegetarian meal later.

08:36.875 --> 08:39.292
Many immortals make
a trip here just to burn it off us.

08:40.167 --> 08:41.167
Marvelous.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.708
I can already tell you are hungry.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.667
We are.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.375
Just wait, then.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.750
Hey, monkey! No touching!

08:49.833 --> 08:51.375
You can't afford to break anything.

08:51.458 --> 08:52.542
Watch your mouth.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.042
You can't afford to irritate me.

08:55.625 --> 08:56.625
You...

08:56.667 --> 08:58.292
Let's go. Just ignore him.

09:02.250 --> 09:10.250
Heavenly lake

09:21.208 --> 09:23.417
So you don't worship the three pure ones?

09:23.917 --> 09:25.083
How arrogant!

09:25.750 --> 09:26.750
Wukong,

09:27.083 --> 09:28.583
you are in my way.

09:28.667 --> 09:29.958
Troublesome.

09:33.167 --> 09:34.625
Look at how poor he is.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.934
I don't know why master would
pluck our precious treasure

09:36.958 --> 09:37.958
for him to eat.

09:38.042 --> 09:39.917
Exactly. What a waste!

09:40.708 --> 09:42.167
Pure wind, how about this?

09:42.250 --> 09:43.292
Let's eat it.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.208
What if master finds out?

09:46.792 --> 09:47.875
Just give them enough food

09:47.958 --> 09:50.250
and send them away before master returns.

09:51.542 --> 09:52.583
Treasure?

10:00.208 --> 10:02.167
Where has the monkey gone again?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.083
You almost scared me to death.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.333
Why are you not dead yet?

10:07.417 --> 10:08.417
Beat it.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.417
Guess what?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.083
They have a treasure in this temple

10:12.167 --> 10:14.000
- that is edible.
- Tell me now.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.375
I just love to talk slowly.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.083
Are you telling or not?

10:21.167 --> 10:22.375
Okay, I will.

10:23.458 --> 10:24.583
The kids said

10:25.417 --> 10:26.875
that the treasure is so good,

10:26.958 --> 10:28.292
they must keep it from us.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.415
They will keep it from me?

10:29.917 --> 10:31.333
Then I will have to eat it.

10:31.875 --> 10:32.708
See?

10:32.792 --> 10:34.500
That's why master dotes on you.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.292
You are the real deal. A tough guy!

10:57.958 --> 10:58.958
Get up here.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.833
I nearly had my guts squeezed out!

11:10.375 --> 11:11.958
Impressive.

11:12.042 --> 11:14.542
What a big pit!

12:14.125 --> 12:15.792
It really is a treasure.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.250
Let's pick some and have a taste.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.458
Look, wukong.

12:19.542 --> 12:20.417
Lord monkey.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.792
Mr. Great sage.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.667
Make it quick!

12:23.750 --> 12:25.667
Hurry, will you?

12:27.042 --> 12:28.542
How impatient.

12:42.042 --> 12:43.042
Down you come!

13:12.417 --> 13:15.042
I can sense both heavenly
and demonic energy.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.458
That's weird.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.958
Come on out!

13:38.625 --> 13:39.875
My greetings, great sage.

13:39.958 --> 13:42.250
- I am the local god of long...
- 4-009, my ass.

13:42.333 --> 13:43.333
You stole my treasure.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.500
Now, you want to tell me your name?

13:46.833 --> 13:48.042
You're mistaken!

13:48.875 --> 13:51.375
I would never dare to mess with you.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.042
- I am just a small...
- Bigger.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.333
- Stop.
- A small and humble spirit.

13:56.417 --> 13:57.792
If you don't hand it over,

13:57.875 --> 13:59.208
I will turn your earth.

13:59.292 --> 14:01.042
Out with it. Where is it hidden?

14:01.667 --> 14:03.333
This treasure

14:03.833 --> 14:05.875
is known as grass-returning cinnabar

14:05.958 --> 14:08.292
or manfruit.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.792
It takes at least 10,000 years

14:10.875 --> 14:13.417
to grow from blossom to ripened fruit.

14:13.917 --> 14:14.958
Only 30 fruits are formed

14:15.042 --> 14:16.750
in one harvest.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.375
If you eat one,

14:18.458 --> 14:19.667
you would live

14:19.750 --> 14:22.792
for 47,000 years.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.315
What is the use in living that long?

14:24.375 --> 14:25.625
I only care if it is tasty.

14:25.708 --> 14:26.958
Go on.

14:27.042 --> 14:28.458
Hold on.

14:28.542 --> 14:29.667
The manfruits

14:29.750 --> 14:31.583
fear only the five elements.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.042
If they meet metal, they fall.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.333
If they meet wood, they rot.

14:34.417 --> 14:35.833
If they meet water, they dissolve.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.417
If they meet fire, they burn.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.833
And if they meet the earth, they sink.

14:46.542 --> 14:47.542
Great sage!

14:48.292 --> 14:50.958
It really is an amazing treasure.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.667
So it went into the earth.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.625
Great sage, although the fruit is good,

14:54.833 --> 14:55.458
this tree...

14:55.500 --> 14:57.250
Okay, stop blabbering. Leave.

14:57.292 --> 14:59.375
Great sage, don't touch this tree!

15:27.167 --> 15:28.208
Let's do it here.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.668
We should wait
for them to leave before eating it.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.417
I still feel nervous.

15:32.667 --> 15:33.833
What are you waiting for?

15:33.917 --> 15:35.917
Once it is picked, the fruit won't keep.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.333
Awesome.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.707
Wukong, pretty please.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.833
Can I get a bite?

16:01.500 --> 16:02.582
I was so excited

16:02.583 --> 16:04.166
that I finished it in one gulp.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.000
I didn't even taste its flavor.

16:07.417 --> 16:08.542
Oh no!

16:09.708 --> 16:12.625
Six, seven, eight, nine.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.958
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen!

16:19.625 --> 16:20.458
Twenty-one!

16:20.542 --> 16:21.583
Twenty-two!

16:21.667 --> 16:22.500
Twenty-three!

16:22.583 --> 16:23.583
Twenty-four!

16:25.292 --> 16:26.750
- Four short!
- Four short!

16:26.833 --> 16:27.958
Get one yourself.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.292
Venerable monkey!

16:30.375 --> 16:31.375
Could you get

16:31.417 --> 16:33.625
one last fruit for me?

16:33.708 --> 16:34.542
I'll kick your ass

16:34.625 --> 16:36.125
if you don't shut up.

16:37.292 --> 16:38.292
You are shameless!

16:38.375 --> 16:39.375
Stinking monster!

16:39.458 --> 16:40.750
You ate our treasured fruit!

16:41.375 --> 16:42.375
I didn't.

16:43.958 --> 16:44.958
You did.

16:45.042 --> 16:45.833
I didn't.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.333
- You did!
- You did!

16:47.417 --> 16:48.333
I didn't.

16:48.417 --> 16:49.458
We did.

16:50.167 --> 16:51.333
So what?

16:51.417 --> 16:52.625
You hairy-faced monster!

16:52.708 --> 16:53.917
You're despicable!

16:55.208 --> 16:56.333
Wukong,

16:57.125 --> 16:58.707
what happened?

16:58.708 --> 17:00.917
Monk, don't pretend to be ignorant!

17:02.208 --> 17:03.666
I plucked the manfruits.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.166
I also ate them.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.457
My master had no idea.

17:06.458 --> 17:07.874
It's up to you

17:07.875 --> 17:09.917
to punch me or punish me.

17:12.958 --> 17:14.958
Gods above, lend me your power.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.000
Wukong, don't fight back.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.041
Children, don't drive him mad.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.124
You poor monk.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.666
How could you encourage your disciples

17:35.667 --> 17:36.375
to steal?

17:36.376 --> 17:37.582
Four are missing.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.582
It was obviously

17:39.583 --> 17:41.000
one for each of you!

17:42.667 --> 17:43.999
I admit to eating it,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.166
but not to the amount you said.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.249
We only ate three!

17:47.250 --> 17:48.749
-Fouh -three!

17:48.750 --> 17:49.875
Four!

17:51.042 --> 17:53.249
It was indeed three.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.332
- It was four!
- It was four!

17:54.333 --> 17:55.457
- Three.
- Three.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.208
Three!

17:56.209 --> 17:59.207
Wait. What did you eat behind my back?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.333
-Fouh -fouh

18:02.167 --> 18:04.207
wukong, what did you eat?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.082
Stop pretending, monk.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.833
Your innocent look really makes me sick.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.750
It has nothing to do with him.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.542
I'll make it up to you.

18:14.458 --> 18:15.707
Until our master returns,

18:15.708 --> 18:17.125
you aren't going anywhere!

18:17.625 --> 18:18.791
Get lost.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.624
Wukong, take a deep breath.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.207
Hold your horses.

18:22.208 --> 18:23.874
Who do you think he is?

18:23.875 --> 18:26.457
A bastard monkey with no parents.

18:26.458 --> 18:27.791
What can he do?

18:27.792 --> 18:29.207
Who did you calla bastard?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.916
Monkey, they cursed you.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.166
Yes, I just cursed you.

18:32.167 --> 18:33.499
You are merely a demon

18:33.500 --> 18:35.458
that does nothing but evil.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.708
Then I'll show you what evil is!

18:44.625 --> 18:46.000
Oi of the eight classes of being!

18:56.208 --> 18:57.208
Wukong!

19:00.292 --> 19:01.500
Wukong!

19:02.292 --> 19:04.208
You two bit off more than you can chew!

19:17.459 --> 19:19.000
Return to wuzhuang temple at once!

19:26.542 --> 19:27.375
Evil monkey,

19:27.376 --> 19:29.124
if you dare to touch a single leaf,

19:29.125 --> 19:31.208
great immortal zhenyuan won't let you off!

19:32.833 --> 19:34.875
I will kick the shit out of him as well!

19:48.708 --> 19:50.041
Pure wind, what do we do?

19:50.042 --> 19:51.542
Go all out with this evil monkey!

19:52.750 --> 19:53.999
Great.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.374
Then I will send you both

19:55.375 --> 19:57.000
to hell!

20:23.125 --> 20:24.625
Wukong!

20:54.667 --> 20:55.583
This is a disaster!

20:55.584 --> 20:57.333
We are toast.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.750
Pure wind! Bright moon!

21:00.375 --> 21:02.416
Master, tang sanzang
allowed his evil disciples

21:02.417 --> 21:04.042
to steal our treasured fruits!

21:04.458 --> 21:05.832
The evil monkey, sun wukong,

21:05.833 --> 21:08.417
even destroyed the magic tree!

21:15.417 --> 21:17.083
All disciples,

21:17.458 --> 21:19.375
deploy the demon-quelling array!

21:37.917 --> 21:39.582
Without my command,

21:39.583 --> 21:42.166
no one is to leave his position!

21:42.167 --> 21:43.583
- Yes, master!
- Yes, master!

21:48.083 --> 21:49.749
Forgive me, great immortal zhenyuan.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.625
It is my failure in disciplining them.

21:52.292 --> 21:54.749
I am willing to be punished.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.249
I have treated you with courtesy,

21:56.250 --> 21:58.167
yet you indulged your pupil's wicked ways.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.082
I ate the manfruit.

22:00.083 --> 22:01.666
I kicked down the tree.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.207
Come at me.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.625
Cheeky ape!

22:17.792 --> 22:19.292
Your target is the monkey.

22:19.375 --> 22:20.833
Why did you hit me?

22:26.583 --> 22:28.167
Old jerk, don't run!

22:31.625 --> 22:33.042
Great immortal,

22:33.125 --> 22:35.125
please calm down!

23:01.125 --> 23:02.792
Master, the array is broken!

23:08.125 --> 23:09.875
Golden cicada,

23:10.542 --> 23:12.792
how have you been?

23:19.458 --> 23:20.958
Wukong!

23:25.833 --> 23:26.833
There is no time.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.333
Draw in!

24:02.792 --> 24:04.375
Stupid demons!

24:42.625 --> 24:44.667
Pure wind, bright moon, take your orders.

24:44.750 --> 24:45.870
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.333
Report to the Jade emperor at once.

24:47.417 --> 24:48.708
This monkey, sun wukong,

24:48.792 --> 24:50.375
took down the magic tree

24:50.458 --> 24:52.208
and released primordium, the primal demon!

24:53.958 --> 24:55.208
- Yes, master!
- Yes, master!

24:55.292 --> 24:56.708
Primordium, the primal demon?

24:58.750 --> 25:00.583
Is there really such a demon?

25:03.375 --> 25:06.125
You lot have committed a heinous crime.

25:06.208 --> 25:08.333
Await punishment from heaven.

25:08.583 --> 25:09.707
What is our crime?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.542
This manfruit tree

25:11.792 --> 25:13.082
was created by the qi energy

25:13.083 --> 25:14.957
of a disciple of Buddha.

25:14.958 --> 25:17.457
Its roots impaled primordium's acupoints

25:17.458 --> 25:19.250
to keep him sealed in the ground.

25:19.917 --> 25:21.042
It is just a demon.

25:21.542 --> 25:24.458
Why is the patriarch of
the earth's immortals so scared?

25:25.083 --> 25:26.500
I'm going to save my master.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.624
While I'm at it, I'll get the demon too.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.332
Easier said than done.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.916
In three days,

25:31.917 --> 25:33.958
primordium's original body
will be restored.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.707
When he devours your master

25:36.708 --> 25:39.125
and gains golden cicada's
ten lifetimes of cultivation,

25:39.625 --> 25:40.625
chaos

25:40.833 --> 25:43.416
and fatal destruction

25:43.417 --> 25:45.125
will beset the three realms.

25:45.667 --> 25:48.667
There is no demon that I cannot subdue!

25:49.583 --> 25:51.999
You overestimate yourself.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.416
What if I can do it?

25:53.417 --> 25:54.749
What if you can't?

25:54.750 --> 25:56.333
I'll be at your disposal!

25:56.625 --> 25:57.625
All right.

25:58.458 --> 26:00.582
If you fail to catch primordium,

26:00.583 --> 26:03.499
you will once again be imprisoned
beneath five elements mountain

26:03.500 --> 26:05.958
and never taste freedom.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.000
All right.

26:12.250 --> 26:13.750
You have a deal.

26:14.417 --> 26:15.792
That's a deal.

26:22.708 --> 26:23.667
Come on.

26:23.668 --> 26:24.874
Let's save master.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.374
Monkey, that's the ancestor of all demons!

26:27.375 --> 26:28.750
Shut up!

26:30.125 --> 26:31.125
But...

28:10.125 --> 28:12.125
Where did this wild demon come from?

28:12.292 --> 28:13.916
How dare he?

28:13.917 --> 28:16.042
He's big enough to feed us for a few days.

28:16.958 --> 28:18.333
What kind of demon is it?

28:18.875 --> 28:19.999
Are you blind?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.374
It's just a giant salamander.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.624
Piss off! You're the blind one.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.917
No giant salamander is this ugly.

28:35.417 --> 28:37.333
State your name and die.

28:40.458 --> 28:41.917
Primordium.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.916
I am king white brows of millennium peak.

28:48.917 --> 28:51.416
My minions and I
congratulate you on your revival,

28:51.417 --> 28:52.958
ancestor of demons!

28:53.375 --> 28:54.624
Primordium, the primal demon.

28:54.625 --> 28:55.625
Yes.

28:57.000 --> 28:57.917
Exactly!

28:57.958 --> 29:00.083
Congratulations on your revival, ancestor.

29:00.125 --> 29:02.458
We have been waiting for a long time.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.042
My revival.

29:04.792 --> 29:07.458
During those thousands of years in hell,

29:07.792 --> 29:09.041
your qi energy

29:09.042 --> 29:11.708
turned me into this form.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.582
My body

29:13.583 --> 29:15.917
was devoured by the dark earth.

29:16.125 --> 29:19.083
It was all because of you!

29:21.417 --> 29:23.291
Golden cicada,

29:23.292 --> 29:24.667
in three days,

29:25.250 --> 29:26.625
I will

29:26.708 --> 29:29.125
once again rule over the three realms!

29:37.167 --> 29:39.250
- My goodness! Such power!
- My goodness! Such power!

29:43.875 --> 29:46.792
Before my original body is restored,

29:46.875 --> 29:48.708
take care of this monk.

29:48.792 --> 29:49.625
Don't worry.

29:49.708 --> 29:50.875
Leave him to us.

30:00.750 --> 30:01.917
Wukong!

30:03.000 --> 30:04.292
Help!

30:06.042 --> 30:08.000
Ancestor, this monk's head disciple

30:08.083 --> 30:09.750
is not to be messed with.

30:09.833 --> 30:11.250
He is the powerful sun wukong,

30:11.333 --> 30:12.167
king of demons,

30:12.250 --> 30:14.167
who wreaked havoc at the temple in heaven

30:14.250 --> 30:15.500
500 years ago.

30:15.583 --> 30:17.042
The king of demons?

30:19.292 --> 30:21.000
In the absence of a tiger,

30:21.083 --> 30:23.083
even a monkey can take the throne.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.500
Good point, ancestor.

30:25.583 --> 30:28.042
Sun wukong is indeed a monkey!

30:36.083 --> 30:38.726
We're only telling Jade emperor
that the monkey released primordium.

30:38.750 --> 30:39.875
Don't say too much.

30:39.958 --> 30:42.542
Pure wind, will we get in trouble too?

30:42.625 --> 30:43.625
Don't you get it?

30:44.042 --> 30:46.292
We need to lay the blame on that monkey.

30:47.333 --> 30:48.333
I get it now.

31:08.583 --> 31:09.708
Virupaksa,

31:09.792 --> 31:11.500
we have an urgent report for his majesty.

31:11.583 --> 31:12.875
Please let us pass.

31:14.167 --> 31:16.667
No hurry, children.

31:32.542 --> 31:33.667
Please wait

31:33.750 --> 31:36.125
as I write the notification.

31:36.208 --> 31:37.083
Heavenly king,

31:37.167 --> 31:39.226
our master is
the patriarch of the earth's immortals.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.292
No hurry, children.

31:41.375 --> 31:43.208
Whoever he is,

31:43.292 --> 31:46.167
matters must be handled impartially.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.042
Then go ahead. Be quick.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.917
Wukong, we must find the primal demon

32:08.000 --> 32:09.125
before his body is restored.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.375
Let's drop it.

32:10.458 --> 32:11.542
We have searched all night.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.375
Even if we do find primordium,

32:13.458 --> 32:15.042
master must be dead already.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.667
Bajie, don't curse master.

32:28.375 --> 32:29.417
It's master's ghost!

32:29.500 --> 32:31.000
Don't come to me!

32:31.750 --> 32:33.792
Master, please forgive bajie.

32:33.875 --> 32:36.042
Master, I will keep my mouth shut.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.583
Please go and be reincarnated.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.917
I shouldn't have cursed you.

32:45.125 --> 32:46.500
Where are you from, demon?

32:46.583 --> 32:48.583
Answer or I will bust your ass.

33:25.458 --> 33:26.708
It's comfy.

33:31.833 --> 33:34.042
What kind of demon are you?

33:34.125 --> 33:35.750
I'm not a demon.

33:35.833 --> 33:38.083
I'm qi energy.

33:38.167 --> 33:39.542
Qi energy?

33:39.583 --> 33:40.583
Yes!

33:41.625 --> 33:43.332
I am qi energy.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.916
I can catch primordium and seal him away.

33:45.917 --> 33:47.582
I heard you were looking for primordium,

33:47.583 --> 33:48.832
so I followed you.

33:48.833 --> 33:51.375
Are you the qi energy
that sealed primordium under the tree?

33:51.667 --> 33:54.458
Yes!

33:54.667 --> 33:56.124
Do you know me?

33:56.125 --> 33:58.292
Come here, little thing.

33:58.333 --> 33:59.666
You're not a demon.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.249
But we are.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.500
Are you not afraid?

34:03.708 --> 34:05.332
All sentient beings
dwell in the ten worlds,

34:05.333 --> 34:07.291
which include the six realms of rebirth.

34:07.292 --> 34:08.999
There are tens of millions of demons.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.083
Stop it.

34:11.792 --> 34:13.500
Qi energy, my ass.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.000
You're just a manfruit spirit.

34:23.083 --> 34:26.833
Primordium, where are you hiding?

34:36.167 --> 34:37.707
Gently!

34:37.708 --> 34:39.291
Great sage!

34:39.292 --> 34:42.874
I just escaped from longevity mountain.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.916
Why did you bring me back?

34:44.917 --> 34:45.875
Why were you running?

34:45.876 --> 34:47.916
You released primordium.

34:47.917 --> 34:49.166
If I don't run,

34:49.167 --> 34:50.832
I will be dead meat.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.499
Tell me. Where is primordium hiding?

34:52.500 --> 34:53.375
Great sage,

34:53.376 --> 34:55.666
this is the mountain deity's territory.

34:55.667 --> 34:57.207
He knows every move made

34:57.208 --> 34:58.417
within the territory.

34:58.583 --> 34:59.874
Mountain deity?

34:59.875 --> 35:01.375
Go and bring him to me.

35:02.708 --> 35:05.083
The mountain deity
dwells in five blessings peak.

35:05.208 --> 35:07.457
He is an immortal with a temple.

35:07.458 --> 35:09.792
A humble spirit like me
can't make him do anything.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.291
I'll go see him myself.

35:12.292 --> 35:13.582
Great sage,

35:13.583 --> 35:16.457
primordium must be hiding
somewhere in the dark.

35:16.458 --> 35:17.707
A demon can't be too careful

35:17.708 --> 35:19.416
when restoring himself.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.541
The qi energy that sealed primordium

35:21.542 --> 35:23.999
has taken a human form
after 10,000 years of cultivation.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.667
If he were to help you...

35:29.708 --> 35:31.292
You have become senile.

35:31.792 --> 35:33.916
How could that fruit spirit
seal primordium?

35:33.917 --> 35:35.166
Wukong, look.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.791
It is what the book says.

35:36.792 --> 35:38.582
"A disciple of Buddha

35:38.583 --> 35:40.457
had to exert all his qi energy

35:40.458 --> 35:42.833
to subdue primordium."

35:50.250 --> 35:53.375
Are those three demons looking for me?

35:54.708 --> 35:56.417
Golden cicada,

35:56.958 --> 35:59.167
do you really think

35:59.250 --> 36:01.292
that they can save you?

36:03.708 --> 36:05.875
I took them as disciples

36:05.958 --> 36:07.625
to unite them.

36:10.042 --> 36:11.250
A hateful demon,

36:11.333 --> 36:12.458
a greedy monster,

36:12.542 --> 36:14.583
and an ignorant devil.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.208
Unite them?

36:16.292 --> 36:17.375
Golden cicada,

36:17.458 --> 36:19.667
you should stop dreaming.

36:21.625 --> 36:23.708
All sentient beings are equal,

36:23.792 --> 36:25.792
whether demon, monster, ghost,

36:25.875 --> 36:27.625
human, deity, immortal, or spirit.

36:27.708 --> 36:29.750
As long as we are

36:29.833 --> 36:31.500
of one mind and one soul,

36:31.583 --> 36:32.583
that will be enough.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.083
Demons

36:34.583 --> 36:36.708
have no such thing!

36:43.333 --> 36:44.458
Great master,

36:45.167 --> 36:47.417
you sacrificed your life

36:47.500 --> 36:49.000
to save the world

36:49.083 --> 36:51.125
and gave peace to future generations.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.625
I am deeply impressed.

36:55.708 --> 36:56.708
Fish brains,

36:57.708 --> 37:00.583
take fruitie to five blessings peak.

37:03.125 --> 37:04.708
Fruitie!

37:05.875 --> 37:06.875
Let's go!

37:12.542 --> 37:13.667
You're running?

37:18.583 --> 37:19.583
It smells good!

37:34.583 --> 37:35.875
Whose pig is that?

37:37.667 --> 37:38.833
Here you are!

37:38.917 --> 37:40.458
Get lost if you're not buying.

37:40.542 --> 37:41.542
Brat!

37:41.625 --> 37:42.792
Leave. Move it!

37:42.875 --> 37:44.625
- Run!
- Wait for me!

37:44.708 --> 37:45.583
Come on!

37:45.667 --> 37:46.667
Come.

37:48.208 --> 37:49.833
I love eating this!

37:51.250 --> 37:52.833
- Demon!
- A demon!

37:54.542 --> 37:55.583
A demon!

37:55.667 --> 37:57.042
There is a demon!

38:03.042 --> 38:05.458
Look at this cloth and color.

38:05.542 --> 38:08.500
Red and green really suit your wife.

38:08.583 --> 38:09.583
Demon!

38:34.708 --> 38:36.375
A fruit spirit eating fruit?

38:37.292 --> 38:38.583
How cruel!

38:58.542 --> 38:59.542
Hide inside.

39:09.583 --> 39:12.000
- King white brows.
- King white brows.

39:14.125 --> 39:16.833
- All-powerful.
- All-powerful.

39:19.250 --> 39:21.917
- Almighty.
- Almighty.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.875
- A king unmatched.
- A king unmatched.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.708
Who are you

39:30.792 --> 39:33.292
to stand in the way of king white brows?

39:34.500 --> 39:35.583
I am...

39:36.208 --> 39:37.833
Master shaves brows.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.917
Cut up this scum into pieces

39:44.000 --> 39:46.458
and eradicate that qi energy!

40:15.292 --> 40:16.417
Golden cudgel?

40:34.250 --> 40:35.958
Sun wukong, the king of demon?

40:36.875 --> 40:38.833
No, stay back!

40:39.333 --> 40:41.375
I won't hurt you!

40:54.083 --> 40:55.375
Monkey!

40:55.458 --> 40:56.958
Monkey!

41:27.708 --> 41:29.457
Don't let that qi energy escape!

41:29.458 --> 41:30.500
Chaseifl

41:32.583 --> 41:34.583
catch that qi energy!

41:53.333 --> 41:55.083
Monkey!

42:20.292 --> 42:22.167
Don't leave us behind, my lord!

42:44.167 --> 42:45.250
Let's go.

43:03.875 --> 43:05.625
Those folks won't survive.

43:06.208 --> 43:07.832
Life is fleeting.

43:07.833 --> 43:09.375
Get used to it.

43:32.833 --> 43:35.083
Father!

43:53.000 --> 43:54.958
Amitébha.

44:00.917 --> 44:01.917
Master?

44:23.042 --> 44:24.458
What happened, father?

44:30.167 --> 44:31.666
My son!

44:31.667 --> 44:33.167
My son.

44:36.208 --> 44:38.667
Great master, what's wrong?

45:02.542 --> 45:04.541
This boy is a glutton

45:04.542 --> 45:06.292
just like me.

45:07.125 --> 45:08.749
Bajie, you like meat.

45:08.750 --> 45:09.791
He's more like master.

45:09.792 --> 45:11.125
He only likes fruit.

45:16.750 --> 45:18.042
Fruitie, hop on!

45:24.708 --> 45:26.500
Ancestor!

45:27.000 --> 45:28.167
Ancestor!

45:31.542 --> 45:32.624
Ancestor,

45:32.625 --> 45:35.499
I was just about
to finish off that qi energy

45:35.500 --> 45:37.166
when all of a sudden

45:37.167 --> 45:38.791
sun wukong turned up

45:38.792 --> 45:39.957
with his golden cudgel

45:39.958 --> 45:41.917
and took my men by surprise!

45:42.083 --> 45:43.750
Bunch of losers.

45:44.458 --> 45:46.208
Ancestor!

45:46.292 --> 45:47.625
Ancestor!

45:47.708 --> 45:50.374
I have another brilliant plan!

45:50.375 --> 45:51.500
Ancestor!

46:03.458 --> 46:05.708
Sun wukong.

46:15.333 --> 46:16.499
Why must the mountain deity

46:16.500 --> 46:18.332
live at the top of the mountain?

46:18.333 --> 46:20.417
I'm exhausted.

46:25.917 --> 46:27.416
When we confront primordium,

46:27.417 --> 46:29.374
stay as far away as you can.

46:29.375 --> 46:30.832
I'm going to seal him

46:30.833 --> 46:32.249
and help you save your master.

46:32.250 --> 46:33.292
Stop it.

46:33.542 --> 46:34.749
He's my master.

46:34.750 --> 46:35.792
I can save him.

47:06.292 --> 47:07.625
Poor mountain deity,

47:07.667 --> 47:09.208
you're so unpopular.

47:09.292 --> 47:10.372
Your tributes have spoiled,

47:10.417 --> 47:12.125
but no one's here to change them for you!

47:12.208 --> 47:13.917
His Dharma body isn't here.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.375
Bajie, search the mountain with Sandy.

47:16.458 --> 47:18.500
I will wait right here for him.

47:18.583 --> 47:19.458
I'm not going.

47:19.542 --> 47:21.667
He may be gone,
but his temple is still here.

47:21.750 --> 47:23.625
Wouldn't it be sweet if we all wait here?

47:23.708 --> 47:24.792
Are you going or not?

47:24.875 --> 47:27.250
No, find someone else who wants to.

47:34.958 --> 47:36.042
Monkey!

47:36.417 --> 47:39.542
Monkey, I admire you so much.

47:42.167 --> 47:44.375
If I can't do it, who can?

47:47.375 --> 47:49.542
Sandy, why are you just standing there?

47:49.625 --> 47:50.625
Come with me!

48:31.792 --> 48:34.875
Mountain deity temple

48:40.292 --> 48:42.874
Monkey, I want some water!

48:42.875 --> 48:44.250
Troublesome!

48:47.667 --> 48:49.375
Monkey, I want to pee.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.500
Hold it in.

49:14.417 --> 49:16.417
It's comfy.

49:18.833 --> 49:20.458
Not even my master

49:21.792 --> 49:23.500
dares to piss on my head!

49:32.792 --> 49:34.542
You're so annoying! Get off!

49:40.667 --> 49:42.625
Sun wukong!

50:01.375 --> 50:03.458
Give me the qi energy.

50:08.625 --> 50:10.625
Fat chance.

50:30.833 --> 50:32.292
Everyone is here.

50:32.375 --> 50:33.417
Wind raccoon dog!

51:00.500 --> 51:01.375
Wind raccoon dog.

51:01.458 --> 51:03.000
This name rings a bell.

51:10.833 --> 51:11.958
I found it!

51:12.000 --> 51:13.791
"Wind raccoon dog,

51:13.792 --> 51:15.082
a beast born from the wind,
comes and goes without a trace.

51:15.083 --> 51:16.791
It can't be killed by fire or blade.

51:16.792 --> 51:18.749
Only hammer strikes
by the thousands can kill it.

51:18.750 --> 51:19.916
A gust of wind into its mouth

51:19.917 --> 51:21.083
immediately revives it.

51:23.458 --> 51:25.166
Stinker, aren't you fast?

51:25.167 --> 51:26.167
Keep running!

51:40.208 --> 51:41.249
Look.

51:41.250 --> 51:43.417
Now, you're wind raccoon dog jerky!

53:10.583 --> 53:13.083
It's all ruined!

53:13.167 --> 53:15.792
No, it's all ruined!

53:15.875 --> 53:17.458
My temple!

53:17.542 --> 53:18.667
What happened to it?

53:18.750 --> 53:19.958
Who did this?

53:20.042 --> 53:21.417
I won't spare him!

53:22.083 --> 53:23.833
Spill it. Where is primordium?

53:25.083 --> 53:26.417
Aren't you the great sage?

53:27.583 --> 53:29.041
After over 500 years of suppression,

53:29.042 --> 53:30.542
how are you still so handsome?

53:33.625 --> 53:34.791
Answer me. Where is primordium?

53:34.792 --> 53:37.333
Great sage,
you released primordium, didn't you?

53:37.667 --> 53:39.208
Why are you asking me?

53:40.333 --> 53:41.874
I know where he is.

53:41.875 --> 53:43.542
Quick! Come with me!

53:46.667 --> 53:47.958
Move your ass!

53:48.083 --> 53:49.792
Follow me now!

53:56.458 --> 53:58.042
Go! Keep up with him!

54:18.333 --> 54:19.208
Great sage,

54:19.209 --> 54:21.291
maybe I'm talking too much,

54:21.292 --> 54:22.707
but demons all over must be coming

54:22.708 --> 54:25.082
to celebrate their ancestor's revival.

54:25.083 --> 54:28.375
Armies of demons must be on the way.

54:29.042 --> 54:31.082
Even a fierce tiger
is no match for a wolf pack.

54:31.083 --> 54:33.082
Besides, he is primordium.

54:33.083 --> 54:36.249
- He is...
- Big beard, don't worry.

54:36.250 --> 54:37.291
Here I am.

54:37.292 --> 54:38.917
I can seal primordium away.

54:46.458 --> 54:48.875
The qi energy has taken a human form.

54:48.958 --> 54:50.917
If he uses qi energy,

54:51.000 --> 54:52.875
he will deplete it one day.

54:52.958 --> 54:54.542
What happens then?

54:55.208 --> 54:57.458
What do you think will happen?

54:57.542 --> 54:58.792
He'll die?

55:02.333 --> 55:04.250
Once his qi is depleted,

55:04.333 --> 55:06.167
he won't be reincarnated.

55:19.083 --> 55:20.083
Great sage,

55:20.875 --> 55:22.583
primordium is hiding over there.

55:22.958 --> 55:25.625
This mountain is called millennium peak.

55:26.125 --> 55:28.458
Millennium peak?

55:33.500 --> 55:35.375
I must go.

55:35.750 --> 55:37.832
The plants on the mountain

55:37.833 --> 55:39.292
cannot live without me.

55:39.583 --> 55:40.707
Just go.

55:40.708 --> 55:43.041
Excuse me, then.

55:43.042 --> 55:45.042
See you later.

55:48.333 --> 55:49.333
Hold on.

55:59.375 --> 56:00.708
Thank you, great sage.

56:01.625 --> 56:03.291
Take my advice.

56:03.292 --> 56:04.582
Don't sacrifice yourself.

56:04.583 --> 56:06.999
If you seek help from Buddha now,

56:07.000 --> 56:08.417
there might still be a way.

56:39.542 --> 56:40.792
My lord!

56:40.875 --> 56:43.958
Demons from mount crow
of the eastern continent

56:44.042 --> 56:45.125
request an audience!

56:45.208 --> 56:46.208
My lord!

56:46.250 --> 56:47.917
Western continent's nine-headed monster

56:48.000 --> 56:50.125
has entered millennium peak with his men!

56:50.208 --> 56:51.250
My lord!

56:51.333 --> 56:52.417
Demons from mount meru

56:52.500 --> 56:55.875
have come to pay their respects!

57:08.083 --> 57:10.666
I am tawny lion from tiger's jaws cave

57:10.667 --> 57:12.458
at leopard's head mountain.

57:12.958 --> 57:14.666
Multiple-eyed creature

57:14.667 --> 57:16.792
from ghost king mountain.

57:19.875 --> 57:21.499
Nine-tailed Vixen

57:21.500 --> 57:23.292
from dragon-suppressing cave.

57:24.208 --> 57:26.625
We're from lotus cave
at flat peak mountain.

57:26.917 --> 57:28.124
Golden horn.

57:28.125 --> 57:29.625
Silver horn.

57:32.375 --> 57:34.207
Congratulations on your revival

57:34.208 --> 57:36.249
with your original body!

57:36.250 --> 57:38.624
Congratulations on your revival

57:38.625 --> 57:41.125
with your original body!

58:24.958 --> 58:27.791
Monkey, when do we attack primordium?

58:27.792 --> 58:29.083
Sleep now.

58:29.792 --> 58:30.750
No, I won't.

58:30.750 --> 58:31.750
Sleep.

58:37.417 --> 58:38.458
Are you sleeping or not?

58:54.375 --> 58:56.707
Why is your name three syllables

58:56.708 --> 58:58.833
while mine is two syllables?

59:00.417 --> 59:02.250
Fruitie was just off the top of my head.

59:03.292 --> 59:05.207
I love being called fruitie.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.167
I love this name!

59:10.958 --> 59:13.625
That's not really even a name.

59:16.542 --> 59:18.958
So who gave you the name sun wukong?

59:22.958 --> 59:24.083
My master.

59:25.375 --> 59:26.458
Do you know?

59:26.542 --> 59:28.333
It's a terrible-sounding name.

59:32.958 --> 59:34.167
It doesn't matter

59:34.667 --> 59:36.458
as long as I know who I am.

59:37.958 --> 59:40.042
Do you know who you are?

59:40.708 --> 59:42.124
I'm a demon

59:42.125 --> 59:43.792
that does nothing but evil.

59:45.250 --> 59:47.249
There are good and evil demons.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.042
Not all demons do evil.

59:50.042 --> 59:51.458
Are you sleeping or not?

59:52.500 --> 59:54.666
I'm an evil demon.

59:54.667 --> 59:56.542
Don't you fear me?

59:58.333 --> 59:59.625
You are not evil.

59:59.708 --> 1:00:01.583
You have a kind soul.

1:00:02.375 --> 1:00:03.250
I don't have a soul.

1:00:03.251 --> 1:00:04.332
Why?

1:00:04.333 --> 1:00:06.500
I was born from a stone!

1:00:07.833 --> 1:00:10.333
A hard stone with no parents
and covered in hair.

1:00:12.375 --> 1:00:13.958
That's so cool!

1:00:14.042 --> 1:00:15.917
I like stone monkeys.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:17.292
Cool, my ass.

1:00:17.375 --> 1:00:18.500
You're always blabbering,

1:00:18.583 --> 1:00:19.958
just like my master.

1:00:20.042 --> 1:00:20.875
So promise me.

1:00:20.958 --> 1:00:22.542
Let's fetch scriptures together

1:00:22.625 --> 1:00:23.750
after we defeat primordium.

1:00:23.833 --> 1:00:26.042
Okay, I promise.

1:00:27.667 --> 1:00:29.875
Monkey, you're so kind.

1:00:51.375 --> 1:00:52.667
He's asleep.

1:01:09.667 --> 1:01:10.707
Are we going without fruitie?

1:01:10.708 --> 1:01:12.750
Shut it. We can't go with him.

1:01:55.917 --> 1:01:57.457
I started this.

1:01:57.458 --> 1:02:00.083
I will finish the fight on my own.

1:02:04.083 --> 1:02:05.292
Wukong,

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:08.583
we ate those manfruits together.

1:02:09.042 --> 1:02:10.375
Sandy is right.

1:02:10.458 --> 1:02:11.833
Hog all the fun for yourself?

1:02:11.917 --> 1:02:12.917
No way!

1:02:14.167 --> 1:02:15.167
Okay.

1:02:49.708 --> 1:02:51.708
We haven't had a group battle in a while.

1:02:54.417 --> 1:02:55.542
Scumbags,

1:02:55.625 --> 1:02:58.292
take this cracking rake
from your piggy daddy!

1:03:04.667 --> 1:03:06.666
800 ii of flowing sands

1:03:06.667 --> 1:03:08.667
within which all shall sink!

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:14.250
Hammer of ninefold numinosity!

1:03:19.708 --> 1:03:21.833
Marshal of the heavenly canopy?

1:03:21.917 --> 1:03:24.333
You're nothing but a stupid pig.

1:03:26.083 --> 1:03:28.458
Do you think you will win with your bulk?

1:03:44.333 --> 1:03:45.917
You didn't see

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.667
the no man's land

1:03:48.250 --> 1:03:53.167
where white bones lie uncollected.

1:04:03.333 --> 1:04:04.667
The one with all the eyes!

1:04:04.750 --> 1:04:07.000
Do you see now?

1:04:20.458 --> 1:04:21.832
That's so lame.

1:04:21.833 --> 1:04:23.292
Play it to yama in hell!

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.542
Everyone, charge!

1:04:33.875 --> 1:04:35.875
Kill this pig!

1:04:41.792 --> 1:04:42.958
Sun wukong!

1:04:43.583 --> 1:04:46.042
I called your name. Dare you answer?

1:04:53.792 --> 1:04:57.291
Sun wukong, I called your name.

1:04:57.292 --> 1:04:58.625
Dare you answer?

1:05:00.083 --> 1:05:01.958
Who are you to say my full name?

1:05:02.792 --> 1:05:04.957
Buddy, use another magic weapon!

1:05:04.958 --> 1:05:07.249
Why won't he answer me?

1:05:07.250 --> 1:05:08.332
You can keep trying.

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:09.375
I'm leaving first.

1:06:13.417 --> 1:06:15.375
All the demons in the world

1:06:15.917 --> 1:06:18.833
have become so weak.

1:06:21.958 --> 1:06:23.208
The weak

1:06:23.792 --> 1:06:25.667
don't deserve to live.

1:06:26.042 --> 1:06:27.374
Sun wukong,

1:06:27.375 --> 1:06:29.167
give me the qi energy.

1:06:30.167 --> 1:06:31.250
Screw you!

1:06:33.208 --> 1:06:35.291
Give me my master!

1:06:35.292 --> 1:06:37.167
You all are seeking death.

1:08:19.542 --> 1:08:21.792
Is that all you have got?

1:08:25.208 --> 1:08:27.999
Wukong, tell fruitie

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.957
to use qi energy now!

1:08:29.958 --> 1:08:31.624
If he depletes it,

1:08:31.625 --> 1:08:33.833
fruitie will die.

1:08:42.292 --> 1:08:44.375
There you are.

1:08:54.292 --> 1:08:55.416
Monkey!

1:08:55.417 --> 1:08:56.208
Piggy!

1:08:56.209 --> 1:08:57.458
Sandy!

1:09:19.458 --> 1:09:20.667
Monkey!

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.292
Monkey!

1:09:24.667 --> 1:09:26.042
Monkey!

1:09:31.125 --> 1:09:33.375
Fruitie, don't come out!

1:09:47.333 --> 1:09:48.750
Monkey!

1:09:50.917 --> 1:09:52.583
Wukong!

1:09:56.833 --> 1:09:58.125
I will fight you to the death!

1:10:00.208 --> 1:10:01.417
Old demon!

1:10:13.208 --> 1:10:14.333
Bajie!

1:10:14.708 --> 1:10:17.832
Sandy!

1:10:17.833 --> 1:10:19.792
Piggy!

1:10:30.667 --> 1:10:33.042
It's your turn, qi energy.

1:10:33.792 --> 1:10:35.541
Take on a human form,

1:10:35.542 --> 1:10:38.042
suffer as a human!

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:42.458
You are such an idiot.

1:11:51.417 --> 1:11:52.707
Monkey!

1:11:52.708 --> 1:11:53.749
Fruitie!

1:11:53.750 --> 1:11:55.082
Run!

1:11:55.083 --> 1:11:56.583
Get out of here!

1:12:14.583 --> 1:12:15.958
Monkey!

1:12:30.458 --> 1:12:33.416
Let me give you a hand

1:12:33.417 --> 1:12:35.333
to unite you in death.

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:39.792
Wukong!

1:12:40.417 --> 1:12:43.499
- Wukong!
- Master!

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:45.292
Master!

1:12:56.375 --> 1:12:57.916
Golden cicada,

1:12:57.917 --> 1:12:59.874
all your disciples are here.

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:02.083
But none of them can save you.

1:13:08.458 --> 1:13:10.625
As master and disciples,

1:13:11.625 --> 1:13:13.625
I am content with this fate.

1:13:14.375 --> 1:13:16.624
Even if we are killed,

1:13:16.625 --> 1:13:19.208
our souls will never die.

1:13:23.833 --> 1:13:26.500
Give me your golden Dharma body!

1:13:43.708 --> 1:13:46.042
Master.

1:13:59.542 --> 1:14:02.125
Monkey, here!

1:14:06.167 --> 1:14:07.875
Go away.

1:14:12.417 --> 1:14:15.207
Monkey, you promised to take me along

1:14:15.208 --> 1:14:18.167
on the pilgrimage for scriptures!

1:14:23.958 --> 1:14:26.958
- Fruitie, go!
- No!

1:14:28.125 --> 1:14:29.917
Monkey!

1:14:32.167 --> 1:14:34.042
Don't hurt him!

1:14:39.583 --> 1:14:42.332
Only I can help them

1:14:42.333 --> 1:14:44.417
alleviate their pain

1:14:44.792 --> 1:14:46.708
and return them to the primal chaos.

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.417
Sun wukong,

1:14:48.667 --> 1:14:51.250
do you really deserve
to be king of demons?

1:14:51.667 --> 1:14:53.542
You have lost.

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.250
Lost?

1:15:00.708 --> 1:15:03.083
I would

1:15:03.542 --> 1:15:05.124
rather die

1:15:05.125 --> 1:15:08.083
than admit defeat!

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:15.667
Then you shall die!

1:15:35.708 --> 1:15:38.458
Monkey!

1:16:56.250 --> 1:16:57.749
Don't forget

1:16:57.750 --> 1:17:00.000
that his golden Dharma body is inside me.

1:18:23.625 --> 1:18:25.833
This is my world.

1:18:36.333 --> 1:18:38.583
Compliant golden cudgel

1:19:22.333 --> 1:19:24.750
Who the heck are you?

1:20:11.083 --> 1:20:12.291
Primordium,

1:20:12.292 --> 1:20:14.416
now I will tell you

1:20:14.417 --> 1:20:16.125
who I am!

1:20:36.250 --> 1:20:37.874
Icome

1:20:37.875 --> 1:20:39.791
from water curtain cave

1:20:39.792 --> 1:20:41.124
at flowers and fruit mountain.

1:20:41.125 --> 1:20:43.207
I am the great sage equaling heaven,

1:20:43.208 --> 1:20:44.666
king of demons,

1:20:44.667 --> 1:20:46.792
sun wukong!

1:21:29.125 --> 1:21:30.833
Screw you!

1:21:37.750 --> 1:21:39.042
Remember.

1:21:40.167 --> 1:21:42.291
In this world,

1:21:42.292 --> 1:21:46.625
I am the strongest demon!

1:22:29.417 --> 1:22:31.042
I am a demon.

1:22:31.875 --> 1:22:34.625
But the biggest difference between us is

1:22:35.708 --> 1:22:37.417
I have a soul.

1:24:31.708 --> 1:24:33.125
Wukong.

1:24:42.208 --> 1:24:44.333
Master!

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.083
Master!

1:27:42.875 --> 1:27:45.291
This magic tree's life root is damaged.

1:27:45.292 --> 1:27:47.417
Not even I can bring it back to life.

1:27:53.375 --> 1:27:55.416
Goddess of mercy, who can heal it?

1:27:55.417 --> 1:27:56.499
I will find them!

1:27:56.500 --> 1:27:57.957
Cheeky ape,

1:27:57.958 --> 1:28:00.082
the way to save this magic tree

1:28:00.083 --> 1:28:02.750
is right in your own hands, isn't it?

1:28:40.042 --> 1:28:41.083
Fruitie!

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.124
Monkey!

1:28:46.125 --> 1:28:48.875
I want to go on the pilgrimage with you!

1:35:08.917 --> 1:35:11.208
No hurry, children.
