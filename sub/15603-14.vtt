on <i>Covert Affairs...</i>

00:02.912 --> 00:05.071
<i>This is the necklace</i>
<i>you gave me in Rome.</i>

00:05.641 --> 00:07.109
I never stopped wearing it.

00:07.193 --> 00:08.527
I'm glad you're here.

00:08.594 --> 00:10.428
You don't know what it means
to hear you say that.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.397
Federal Agent Rossabi.

00:12.448 --> 00:14.900
I know that you've been
colluding with Annie Walker.

00:14.951 --> 00:17.102
When I'm done you're gonna
be back in a prison cell.

00:17.153 --> 00:21.073
Did you sanction a CIA Black
Ops team to torture Teo Braga

00:21.124 --> 00:23.208
with full knowledge that
he was your husband's son?

00:23.275 --> 00:24.993
- Yes.
- Did your husband know that?

00:25.078 --> 00:26.578
- He will now.
- This belonged to the man

00:26.629 --> 00:28.747
who shot down the helicopter
in Copenhagen.

00:28.798 --> 00:30.448
I was forced to kill him.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.500
Goodman's real name
is Deric Hughes.

00:32.585 --> 00:34.002
I discovered he has close ties
with Henry.

00:34.087 --> 00:36.088
Nelson, this is me.
I need 3 million fast-tracked.

00:36.139 --> 00:37.506
I'll do my best.

00:37.590 --> 00:39.424
You're going to New York
to track down Nelson Smith?

00:39.475 --> 00:41.643
It's better I don't tell you.

00:41.728 --> 00:43.795
- Miss Hanson.
- You found me.

00:45.515 --> 00:46.681
Somebody call 911.

00:46.766 --> 00:47.966
Shut it down.

00:48.017 --> 00:50.268
Shut everything down.

00:53.106 --> 00:55.023
Who is it?

01:01.864 --> 01:03.815
Who's there?

01:06.318 --> 01:08.253
Hello?
Who is it?

01:13.826 --> 01:15.761
Auggie, it's me.

01:36.032 --> 01:37.983
What's wrong?
What is it?

01:40.519 --> 01:42.654
Helen's dead.

01:42.705 --> 01:45.356
I just saw her shot
at the bus terminal.

01:47.410 --> 01:51.129
Helen's--are you sure?

01:51.197 --> 01:54.532
I saw the body myself.

02:01.390 --> 02:03.475
She was, uh--

02:03.542 --> 02:06.211
she was just following Henry.

02:06.262 --> 02:07.729
I know.

02:07.814 --> 02:09.047
I saw him leaving the scene.

02:09.098 --> 02:11.382
I'm pretty sure
he's the one that killed her.

02:15.387 --> 02:18.273
We're gonna get him, Auggie.

02:18.357 --> 02:20.275
Yeah?
How?

02:20.359 --> 02:21.893
I need to find Nelson Smith.

02:21.944 --> 02:24.830
He's the one who's moving
Henry's money.

02:24.897 --> 02:27.199
Helen was looking into him.

02:27.250 --> 02:31.336
- Maybe she had a lead?
- Yeah.

02:31.403 --> 02:33.338
Do you know where
she was staying?

02:38.761 --> 02:40.712
Yeah.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.468
Hey.
Hey, Calder, wait up.

02:46.552 --> 02:47.969
Can it wait six hours?

02:48.054 --> 02:49.855
I gotta finally get some sleep.
I don't think so.

02:49.922 --> 02:51.857
The D.C.S. wants you.

02:56.445 --> 02:57.479
What's going on?

02:57.563 --> 02:58.980
We've got a problem.

02:59.065 --> 03:01.783
You ever heard of a deceased
operative named Helen Hansen?

03:01.868 --> 03:03.818
No.
Why?

03:10.276 --> 03:12.794
Anything Helen found she would
have kept in her head.

03:14.830 --> 03:16.047
Maybe she left
something behind

03:16.115 --> 03:18.616
in case anything happened
to her.

03:20.452 --> 03:21.920
Did she have any tricks?
I mean...

03:21.971 --> 03:25.090
from when you guys were--
Pasta box.

03:25.141 --> 03:27.092
Check the pantry.

03:42.575 --> 03:44.409
I found something.

03:44.476 --> 03:45.493
Yeah?
What is it?

03:45.578 --> 03:47.495
It's in braille.

03:58.708 --> 04:00.658
It's Nelson Smith.

04:06.933 --> 04:09.684
He's a customs official
at I.C.E.

04:09.769 --> 04:11.136
He's in charge of
the port of New York.

04:11.187 --> 04:12.637
I thought Smith was a money guy?

04:12.688 --> 04:15.506
He moves stuff across borders.
Why not cash?

04:15.558 --> 04:16.879
And what's your plan
for approach?

04:16.942 --> 04:19.444
I've dealt with scarier guys
than customs officials.

04:19.511 --> 04:20.812
I'm going to New York.

04:20.863 --> 04:22.814
This is the guy who moves
Henry Wilcox's money.

04:22.865 --> 04:24.466
That's not your typical
customs official.

04:24.516 --> 04:28.036
All I need is proof that
his money paid for Copenhagen.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.022
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

04:31.073 --> 04:32.374
Would you help me gather
her things?

04:32.458 --> 04:35.377
I don't want to leave anything
behind for the cleaners.

04:38.714 --> 04:41.082
Yeah.

04:41.167 --> 04:43.251
You want to get a pillowcase
for her stuff?

04:43.336 --> 04:45.253
Sure.

05:02.738 --> 05:04.689
You seem to know
your way around.

05:07.059 --> 05:08.994
Yeah.

05:11.664 --> 05:15.367
Annie, this is not what
I wanted.

05:15.418 --> 05:17.369
This is not what I want.

05:19.705 --> 05:23.124
You don't have to explain.

05:23.209 --> 05:25.576
I chose this and
I imposed it on you.

05:28.547 --> 05:31.933
I understand.

05:32.018 --> 05:33.968
So, where does this leave us?

05:47.458 --> 05:49.013
How long did it take you
to pick that lock?

05:49.069 --> 05:50.069
About 30 seconds.

05:50.071 --> 05:51.351
Is there another way
out of here?

05:52.389 --> 05:53.389
Get to the fire escape.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.607
You need to take it.
Go.

05:54.692 --> 05:55.852
I'm not gonna leave you here.

05:55.893 --> 05:57.214
You just said
you're not finished.

05:57.228 --> 05:58.978
You can't be seen.
Go.

06:08.939 --> 06:10.073
Hey.

06:10.124 --> 06:11.991
What happened?
Your key get stuck again?

06:13.494 --> 06:14.610
Sorry, man.

06:14.662 --> 06:18.214
I must have the wrong apartment.

06:18.282 --> 06:21.634
Oh, uh--oh, that's okay.
I do it all the time.

06:21.719 --> 06:25.421
Have a good one.

06:27.892 --> 06:30.459
Everything looks good with
the ultrasound.

06:30.511 --> 06:32.846
Now, how much longer until
you go on maternity leave?

06:32.930 --> 06:35.348
I'd like you off your feet
as much as possible.

06:37.852 --> 06:39.569
My due date's the 17th?

06:39.636 --> 06:41.571
Hmm, thereabouts, yes.

06:41.638 --> 06:45.158
What are the chances that
the baby comes early?

06:45.242 --> 06:47.660
It's certainly a possibility.
Well, don't worry.

06:47.745 --> 06:49.662
Even if it happened now,
you'd be fine.

06:49.747 --> 06:51.647
No, but--but what are
the odds?

06:51.699 --> 06:53.983
Is it 20%?
50%?

06:54.034 --> 06:55.484
It doesn't work that way.

06:55.536 --> 06:57.486
Is something the matter?

07:00.875 --> 07:03.042
Arthur's trial starts
that week.

07:03.127 --> 07:05.094
- Joan--
- His first son just passed away

07:05.162 --> 07:06.179
and I really don't want him
to miss

07:06.263 --> 07:08.181
the birth of his second one.

07:15.189 --> 07:17.807
Agent Rossabi.

07:17.858 --> 07:21.144
Are you feeling okay?

07:21.195 --> 07:22.645
The last trimesters are tough,

07:22.696 --> 07:25.982
at least that's what
my sister says.

07:26.033 --> 07:27.116
I'm fine.

07:27.184 --> 07:30.686
Well, that's good to hear.
Um...

07:30.738 --> 07:33.022
I heard about your deposition
at Justice.

07:33.073 --> 07:34.624
Hmm, I didn't realize
I was speaking

07:34.691 --> 07:35.959
to the entire department.

07:36.026 --> 07:38.694
Yeah, well, I was paying
particular attention.

07:38.746 --> 07:41.915
I didn't know you had so much
animus against Henry Wilcox.

07:41.999 --> 07:43.416
That's understated.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.135
Yeah, well my interaction with
him didn't sit right with me.

07:46.203 --> 07:48.137
And that's understated too.

07:50.307 --> 07:51.391
Annie got close to Henry

07:51.475 --> 07:53.059
and that's what
got her killed, right?

07:53.143 --> 07:55.478
You know I can't answer that.

07:55.545 --> 07:57.880
You don't have to.

07:57.932 --> 08:00.566
Hey, look,
I think I found something

08:00.651 --> 08:02.902
that might incriminate
Henry Wilcox,

08:02.987 --> 08:04.487
but I can't take it any further.

08:04.554 --> 08:07.407
What's the lead?

08:07.491 --> 08:09.725
A week ago, we apprehended

08:09.777 --> 08:11.744
a diamond industry consultant
named John Malan.

08:11.829 --> 08:14.697
He was boarding a flight
from JFK to Johannesburg.

08:14.748 --> 08:17.233
Malan was carrying a large
amount of U.S. currency

08:17.284 --> 08:20.236
with peculiar serial numbers,
unaccounted for by Treasury.

08:20.287 --> 08:23.206
I assume it came from
your printing press.

08:23.257 --> 08:24.340
Langley doesn't have
a printing press.

08:24.408 --> 08:25.591
Okay, you know what?

08:25.676 --> 08:28.344
I know that's the company line,
but come on.

08:28.412 --> 08:29.963
What does this have to do
with Henry?

08:30.047 --> 08:33.466
Malan called Lexington from
a nearby diamond wholesaler

08:33.549 --> 08:35.684
an hour before he got to JFK.

08:35.751 --> 08:37.135
And where is he now?

08:37.221 --> 08:40.256
Well, we didn't have enough
on him, so we let him go.

08:40.307 --> 08:42.058
Two days ago,
he showed up dead.

08:42.109 --> 08:44.059
Henry cuts another
loose thread.

08:46.146 --> 08:49.782
Okay, here.

08:49.867 --> 08:51.617
Here's a few of
the serial numbers.

08:51.702 --> 08:52.902
I can't look into it
any further.

08:52.953 --> 08:55.204
Maybe you can.

09:10.971 --> 09:13.423
Ready to go?

09:14.624 --> 09:17.960
Lucas, don't forget
your backpack.

10:34.755 --> 10:35.805
Thanks for meeting.

10:35.872 --> 10:37.140
I was about
to call you anyway.

10:37.207 --> 10:39.175
A Jane Doe was killed
at the bus terminal last night.

10:39.226 --> 10:41.260
She was a deep cover operative.

10:41.345 --> 10:44.564
You talking about
a Helen Hansen?

10:44.648 --> 10:46.065
How do you know her name?

10:46.150 --> 10:48.818
I was called in to manage
the situation for the Agency.

10:48.885 --> 10:50.820
What does that mean, "manage"?

10:50.887 --> 10:53.356
She supposedly died
seven years ago.

10:53.407 --> 10:55.358
They want to know what
she was doing.

10:55.409 --> 10:59.412
I have a feeling you know
something about that.

10:59.496 --> 11:02.248
I know Henry killed her.

11:02.332 --> 11:06.002
How do you know that?

11:06.069 --> 11:07.120
Annie witnessed it.

11:07.204 --> 11:09.122
She what?

11:10.958 --> 11:12.291
Auggie, I'm supposed to be
in on this.

11:12.376 --> 11:13.697
What else are you keeping
from me?

11:13.710 --> 11:16.095
Helen was following Henry
in Geneva.

11:16.180 --> 11:17.380
That's where Annie
was working.

11:17.381 --> 11:19.182
How do we know that this Hansen

11:19.249 --> 11:20.850
did not compromise her
with Henry?

11:20.917 --> 11:23.386
- She didn't.
- You do not know that.

11:23.437 --> 11:25.354
There was a breach here.

11:25.422 --> 11:26.939
Now, the next time
I get a call from Henry,

11:27.024 --> 11:29.258
he's gonna want to thank me or
try to put a bullet in my head.

11:29.309 --> 11:31.978
This whole thing is sloppy,
and now I have to clean it up.

11:32.062 --> 11:33.479
No, you don't have
to clean anything up,

11:33.564 --> 11:35.064
and you want to talk
about sloppy?

11:35.115 --> 11:37.150
Henry killed Helen with
his own hands.

11:37.234 --> 11:38.651
We've got him on his heels.
Let's nail him.

11:38.735 --> 11:40.953
What does that even mean,
"nail him"?

11:41.038 --> 11:43.272
It's not like we can call Annie
in to testify.

11:43.323 --> 11:45.274
The victim died seven years ago,

11:45.325 --> 11:47.076
and the witness died
over three months ago.

11:47.127 --> 11:48.611
Not what a D.A. likes to hear.

11:48.662 --> 11:50.580
Put a surveillance team
on him, Calder.

11:50.631 --> 11:52.965
If he's runnin' scared,
and I know he is,

11:53.050 --> 11:54.383
we will get something
we can use.

11:54.451 --> 11:55.885
That would mean the end
to all of the other plays

11:55.952 --> 11:57.170
I've been making inside
the building.

11:57.254 --> 11:59.722
That's the point, isn't it?
To end it?

11:59.789 --> 12:01.390
You think it's the end
for Annie, huh?

12:01.458 --> 12:02.925
What other lifeline
does she have

12:02.976 --> 12:05.144
if I get sent down
to I.T. with you?

12:06.430 --> 12:08.347
Come on, think!

12:18.692 --> 12:20.643
Thank you.

12:22.496 --> 12:23.696
Hello, Diana.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.115
Joan!

12:27.167 --> 12:29.335
Come on in.
Thanks.

12:29.419 --> 12:32.622
Hi, how are you?
I'm well.

12:32.673 --> 12:35.007
It's really nice to see you.

12:35.092 --> 12:36.492
I didn't know
you still worked here.

12:36.543 --> 12:38.961
Yeah, I'm helping some of
the analysts in crateology.

12:39.012 --> 12:40.732
They're working on
some cool projects there.

12:40.797 --> 12:44.217
Do these numbers mean anything
to you?

12:44.301 --> 12:46.552
Yeah, these are ours.

12:46.637 --> 12:49.639
Any way to tell where
they were going?

12:49.690 --> 12:52.441
- This is for crateology?
- Yeah.

13:00.817 --> 13:01.951
Here you go.
Take a look.

13:02.018 --> 13:04.737
Thank you.

13:04.821 --> 13:08.407
So, this shipment was airlifted
to Kandahar?

13:08.492 --> 13:10.526
Yeah, out of Dover
Air Force base.

13:10.577 --> 13:13.079
And how did it get from here
to Dover?

13:13.163 --> 13:16.198
CIA transport.
It's signed for right here.

16:14.025 --> 16:15.874
Go, go, go, go!

16:24.972 --> 16:27.390
Good job!
Which kid's yours?

16:27.458 --> 16:30.310
Number 11, the midfielder.

16:30.394 --> 16:32.962
He looks like you.

16:33.013 --> 16:36.065
Don't tell my wife that.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.184
Here, you dropped this
at the container yard.

16:41.071 --> 16:43.740
Bringing your gun
to your kid's soccer game?

16:43.807 --> 16:45.074
Not cool.

16:45.142 --> 16:48.695
So, you're the tail I lost
at the train tracks.

16:48.779 --> 16:50.163
What do you want?

16:50.247 --> 16:51.915
Not much.

16:51.982 --> 16:54.451
Just Henry Wilcox's head
on a spike.

16:55.703 --> 16:58.154
Whoo!

16:58.205 --> 17:00.156
Can we not do this here?

17:02.042 --> 17:05.178
Okay.
Let's take a walk.

17:07.464 --> 17:10.517
You're gonna set up camp
outside this address.

17:10.601 --> 17:13.102
Bring all the tech you need
to monitor the house.

17:13.170 --> 17:15.330
Make yourself comfortable.
And by monitor you mean, uh-

17:15.339 --> 17:17.056
Map the entire
security system.

17:17.141 --> 17:18.641
I want to know what kinds
of alarms,

17:18.692 --> 17:20.510
how many guards,
how many cameras.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.861
You looking to map
the security system

17:21.945 --> 17:23.980
or rob the place?
Regardless of the goal,

17:24.031 --> 17:25.647
the procedure is the same.

17:25.699 --> 17:27.450
Here.
What's this?

17:27.518 --> 17:30.069
It's a, uh, small token
of my appreciation.

17:30.154 --> 17:31.488
You've been risking
a lot helping me out.

17:31.539 --> 17:33.039
I don't want you to think
it's gone unnoticed.

17:33.123 --> 17:38.244
Thanks, man, but, uh, there
are a lot of trans fats in here.

17:38.329 --> 17:39.746
Since when has that been
a problem?

17:39.830 --> 17:41.030
Oh, I'm gettin' healthy.

17:41.081 --> 17:42.832
Yeah, I drank a bundle
of kale this morning.

17:42.883 --> 17:45.301
It tasted disgusting,
but I feel great.

17:45.369 --> 17:46.869
Good for you, man.

17:46.921 --> 17:48.137
Is, um...

17:48.205 --> 17:51.724
Is this Henry Wilcox's address?

17:51.809 --> 17:55.395
I've gone along with a lot
without asking any questions

17:55.479 --> 18:01.067
because I believe in you, and,
um, well, I'm no fan of him,

18:01.151 --> 18:03.269
but this feels like
we're crossing a line here, man.

18:03.354 --> 18:05.234
We crossed that line
a long time ago, my friend.

18:05.272 --> 18:07.106
Incoming call.

18:07.191 --> 18:08.825
Joan Campbell.
I should take this.

18:08.892 --> 18:09.826
Yeah.

18:09.893 --> 18:12.328
Hey, go easy.

18:16.567 --> 18:17.700
Hello?

18:17.751 --> 18:20.086
Hey, Auggie.
I'm trying to reach Helen.

18:20.170 --> 18:22.922
Have you spoken
with her recently?

18:23.007 --> 18:26.926
- Why?
- Are you okay?

18:27.011 --> 18:28.878
Yeah.

18:28.929 --> 18:30.213
I might have discovered
how Henry's

18:30.264 --> 18:31.848
been financing his operations.

18:31.915 --> 18:33.850
With money he stole from the--

18:36.270 --> 18:37.303
from the CIA.

18:37.388 --> 18:39.138
Wh-what?

18:39.223 --> 18:41.441
We were supposed to ship
200 million to Kandahar

18:41.525 --> 18:42.892
that never even made it
on a plane.

18:42.943 --> 18:45.028
A courier just showed up
on our radar

18:45.095 --> 18:46.429
with some of the stolen bills.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.097
It looks like Henry's
been using diamonds

18:48.148 --> 18:49.699
to launder and move
money around.

18:49.766 --> 18:51.767
Why do you want
to reach Helen?

18:51.819 --> 18:53.536
I need her to run something
down in New York for me.

18:53.604 --> 18:55.845
It's not like we have that many
people left we can trust.

18:57.791 --> 19:00.960
Joan, Helen's dead.

19:01.045 --> 19:02.278
What?

19:02.329 --> 19:04.747
What happened?

19:04.798 --> 19:06.499
Henry shot her.

19:06.584 --> 19:10.303
Oh, my God.
I...

19:10.387 --> 19:13.306
I'm so sorry, Auggie.
I...

19:13.390 --> 19:17.477
What can I do for you?
How can I help?

19:17.561 --> 19:19.762
You can tell me how
I pay respects

19:19.813 --> 19:22.015
to someone who's already
supposed to be dead.

19:23.967 --> 19:26.469
I can't bury her
in the same grave.

19:26.520 --> 19:29.355
I can't tell her parents
and break their hearts again.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.325
Auggie, don't do anything
foolish.

19:34.328 --> 19:36.279
What is it you wanted Helen
to run down?

19:38.782 --> 19:40.700
It's okay.

19:40.784 --> 19:42.702
I'll figure out a different way.

19:47.875 --> 19:48.925
Hey, Tommy.
What do you got for me?

19:48.992 --> 19:50.192
I pulled all
the camera footage

19:50.210 --> 19:51.628
from the station last night.

19:51.679 --> 19:52.995
I'm guessing that's the one
you're looking for.

19:53.047 --> 19:54.347
Mr. Wilcox.

19:54.431 --> 19:56.633
Anything more incriminating
I should be aware of?

19:56.684 --> 19:59.352
- Cameras didn't catch much.
- Thanks, man.

20:02.306 --> 20:05.508
You know, kidnapping a federal
official will get you 25 years.

20:05.559 --> 20:06.509
You know what you get
for conspiring

20:06.560 --> 20:09.178
to commit an act of terrorism?

20:09.229 --> 20:11.648
Life...

20:11.699 --> 20:12.699
Or not.

20:12.783 --> 20:14.367
What act of terrorism?

20:14.451 --> 20:16.619
Copenhagen.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.788
You sent Deric Hughes
$10 million

20:18.855 --> 20:21.074
before he took a helicopter
out of the sky.

20:21.158 --> 20:24.627
- No, I never met that man.
- I'm sure you didn't.

20:24.695 --> 20:25.995
I bet there are
a lot of protocols in place

20:26.046 --> 20:28.131
to make sure Henry's people
never meet each other.

20:28.198 --> 20:29.799
You know, that's a lot
to assume based on

20:29.800 --> 20:32.635
a little piece of blue plastic.

20:32.703 --> 20:36.556
Five pallets, three vans.
I'm not assuming anything.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.591
I've been watching you for
a lot longer

20:38.676 --> 20:40.593
than you should
feel comfortable with.

20:42.396 --> 20:43.730
What is this,
some kind of shakedown?

20:43.814 --> 20:45.848
Is that--
is that what's going on here?

20:45.899 --> 20:46.933
'Cause you're too late.

20:47.017 --> 20:48.935
I already moved the cash.

20:50.738 --> 20:52.689
Why'd you clear it
all out today?

20:55.109 --> 20:56.275
Let me tell you what happens
to people

20:56.360 --> 20:59.228
who outlive their usefulness
to Henry.

20:59.279 --> 21:01.581
They get eliminated.

21:01.665 --> 21:02.782
And the next person who puts
a gun to your head

21:02.866 --> 21:06.119
is not gonna pause
to ask you a question.

21:06.203 --> 21:08.287
Who the hell are you?

21:08.372 --> 21:10.339
Who the hell
are you?

21:10.407 --> 21:12.241
You think you can live
a double life?

21:12.292 --> 21:14.177
You think you can work for Henry
in the city, punch a clock,

21:14.244 --> 21:16.129
and be home in time for dinner?

21:16.213 --> 21:19.348
That golden retriever is not
gonna protect your family.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.884
You chose this game.

21:21.935 --> 21:23.886
You put them at risk.

21:46.451 --> 21:48.952
Can you hear me?

21:49.003 --> 21:52.206
Hey!
Can you hear me?

22:08.248 --> 22:09.948
Who are you?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.252
Who are you?

22:13.303 --> 22:15.137
I'm nobody.

22:15.222 --> 22:17.139
Oh, yeah?

22:19.142 --> 22:21.093
You're nobody, huh?

22:25.899 --> 22:28.651
No ID.
No credit card.

22:28.735 --> 22:31.237
You're very interested
in Henry Wilcox.

22:31.304 --> 22:32.771
Tell you what, nobody.
Let's give him a call.

22:32.822 --> 22:33.856
Find out who you are.

22:33.940 --> 22:38.310
Stay there!

22:38.361 --> 22:39.578
Your call has been forwarded--

22:39.646 --> 22:43.148
That's a shame.
It's voicemail.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.418
You really don't want him
to know you're here, do you?

22:47.871 --> 22:49.838
Yeah, you don't.

22:49.923 --> 22:52.174
I got an idea.

22:52.259 --> 22:53.926
Why don't we send him a text?

22:53.993 --> 22:57.012
Can I ask you a question?

22:57.097 --> 22:59.515
Are you prepared to kill me?

22:59.599 --> 23:00.933
What?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.334
From the way
you're holding that gun

23:02.385 --> 23:04.053
I can tell you don't get
a lot of opportunity

23:04.137 --> 23:05.688
to use it outside
of target practice.

23:05.772 --> 23:07.606
It'd be pretty hard to miss
from here, wouldn't it?

23:07.674 --> 23:10.192
Look, I get it.

23:10.277 --> 23:13.279
You're underpaid
and underappreciated.

23:13.346 --> 23:15.614
You saw an opportunity
to provide for your family

23:15.682 --> 23:17.283
without anybody getting hurt,

23:17.350 --> 23:20.152
but that part of the deal
is over.

23:22.021 --> 23:23.956
From here on out,
people get hurt.

23:27.327 --> 23:29.378
I have a proposition for you.

23:31.748 --> 23:33.699
I'm listening.

23:55.054 --> 23:55.988
Ew.

23:56.055 --> 23:57.556
Guess who just came home.

23:57.607 --> 23:58.890
Tell me how
a car gets in there.

23:58.942 --> 24:03.279
Uh, there's a gate,
accessed via keypad.

24:03.363 --> 24:05.614
The password's 1850, by the way.

24:05.699 --> 24:07.199
There's an electronic wire
around the perimeter,

24:07.250 --> 24:08.334
apparently to keep dogs out,
but I'm guessing

24:08.401 --> 24:09.735
it's got dual use.

24:09.786 --> 24:11.587
Infrared cameras above
every entrance,

24:11.671 --> 24:12.921
and one facing out
to the street, man.

24:13.006 --> 24:14.957
No one's getting in there.
Not a chance.

24:15.041 --> 24:16.375
Come on, Barber.

24:16.426 --> 24:18.294
Every system has a weak spot.

24:18.378 --> 24:20.262
Well, I'll keep looking then.

24:20.347 --> 24:23.215
- What's he doin'?
- He's turning on the TV.

24:23.266 --> 24:25.851
- Is he alone?
- Yep.

24:25.918 --> 24:27.303
Where'd you tell Calder
you were?

24:27.387 --> 24:30.022
I told him I was getting
a root canal.

24:30.089 --> 24:31.023
All right,
I'm comin' down there.

24:31.090 --> 24:32.057
It's not like I don't like

24:32.108 --> 24:33.108
your company or anything,
Auggie,

24:33.193 --> 24:34.860
but on an operation like this,

24:34.927 --> 24:36.195
how much good can
you really do us?

24:36.262 --> 24:38.597
It's not like you can take
a shift or anything.

24:38.648 --> 24:41.066
If he moves, follow him.

24:41.117 --> 24:43.118
I'll be there in about an hour.

24:45.622 --> 24:47.373
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.125
We'd like a status update.

24:50.210 --> 24:51.276
We don't have much.

24:51.328 --> 24:54.463
Okay.
Give me what you got.

24:54.547 --> 24:55.547
She supposedly died in Rome

24:55.615 --> 24:58.133
seven years ago
and became a ghost.

24:58.218 --> 24:59.258
This is a woman we trained

24:59.285 --> 25:00.469
to move through
the world invisibly,

25:00.553 --> 25:02.193
so there wasn't a lot to find
in 24 hours.

25:02.222 --> 25:04.340
What about Auggie Anderson?
They were married for a mission.

25:04.424 --> 25:06.585
She never reached out to him?
He doesn't know anything.

25:06.626 --> 25:07.793
How do you know that?
Did you talk to him?

25:07.844 --> 25:09.127
Yes.
We spoke this morning.

25:09.179 --> 25:10.179
All right.

25:10.263 --> 25:12.097
Pull him in for
a polygraph anyway.

25:12.148 --> 25:14.767
Where are we with
the D.C. police, Calder?

25:14.818 --> 25:16.769
Aren't you gonna introduce us?

25:20.807 --> 25:23.525
Who are you?

25:23.610 --> 25:27.145
Where are we with the police?

25:27.197 --> 25:32.201
D.C. police think they caught
a Jane Doe.

25:32.285 --> 25:33.786
We replaced all camera footage

25:33.837 --> 25:35.587
at the bus station
with dummy footage,

25:35.655 --> 25:38.841
and claimed her corpse from the
city morgue and disposed of it.

25:38.925 --> 25:40.325
There won't be any autopsy,

25:40.377 --> 25:44.296
so status update?
All clear.

25:44.347 --> 25:45.547
Good work.
Thank you.

25:51.003 --> 25:53.672
Hansen's approximate time
of death was around midnight,

25:53.723 --> 25:56.642
and you called me an hour later.

25:56.693 --> 25:59.311
There was no I.D.
on her body and the coroner

25:59.362 --> 26:02.898
still doesn't know her identity,
yet you knew so fast.

26:02.982 --> 26:04.199
What are you insinuating?

26:04.284 --> 26:05.517
I'm just trying to understand

26:05.568 --> 26:08.370
the full contours
of the situation.

26:08.455 --> 26:10.322
You really want to open up
Hansen's case files?

26:10.373 --> 26:12.324
Talk about how she faked her
death so we didn't know?

26:12.375 --> 26:14.076
Talk about who was
running her off-book

26:14.160 --> 26:16.578
for the past seven years?
There's a bigger picture here.

26:16.663 --> 26:18.363
That picture's pretty dark.

26:18.415 --> 26:20.249
If you're unable to see
this thing through to the end,

26:20.333 --> 26:22.835
I need to know now
so I can make other plans.

26:24.304 --> 26:26.722
No.
We're good.

26:26.806 --> 26:28.724
Thank you, Mr. Michaels.
That will be all.

26:35.849 --> 26:37.933
So, let me get this straight.

26:38.017 --> 26:40.436
You want me to let you
walk out of here

26:40.520 --> 26:42.321
with full knowledge of my
involvement in this operation?

26:42.388 --> 26:43.555
Yeah.

26:43.606 --> 26:45.274
I don't even know
who the hell you are.

26:45.358 --> 26:49.161
You want my credentials?

26:49.228 --> 26:52.915
I'm the reason Henry Wilcox
is running scared.

26:52.999 --> 26:57.453
I'm the reason you had to move
that money.

26:57.537 --> 26:59.671
I will bring him to justice.

27:03.293 --> 27:07.095
Okay, you got three days
to get to him.

27:07.180 --> 27:09.932
Three days, or I'll make myself
even more invaluable

27:10.016 --> 27:12.468
to Henry Wilcox, 'cause
I'll tell him you're coming.

27:12.552 --> 27:14.470
Deal.

27:19.142 --> 27:21.727
So, what do you want from me?

27:21.778 --> 27:23.195
Information.

27:23.262 --> 27:24.696
When did he tell you
to move the money?

27:24.764 --> 27:26.782
Late last night.

27:26.866 --> 27:27.950
Where'd you take it?

27:28.034 --> 27:30.536
To a diamond wholesaler
in Brooklyn.

27:30.603 --> 27:32.070
Courier's picking it up
this afternoon.

27:32.121 --> 27:34.490
And where's he taking them?

27:34.574 --> 27:36.992
Henry's picking up shop.
He's moving to Hong Kong.

27:38.795 --> 27:40.746
Why is he going to Hong Kong?

27:52.425 --> 27:55.928
Hi, Arthur, it's me.
I-I didn't want to wake you

27:55.979 --> 27:59.431
before I left this morning, but
I just wanted to let you know

27:59.482 --> 28:01.800
I had a really good appointment
at the doctor's.

28:01.851 --> 28:06.355
Everything looks great with
the baby.

28:06.439 --> 28:08.941
I just wish I could say
the same about us.

28:11.361 --> 28:15.197
Listen, I hope you know
that even if we're fighting,

28:15.281 --> 28:20.002
I will always fight for you.

28:20.086 --> 28:21.920
This probably isn't
the best time to tell you

28:21.988 --> 28:23.789
I won't be home for dinner
'cause I'm working late,

28:23.840 --> 28:27.543
but I hope you're up when
I get there.

28:30.513 --> 28:32.464
I love you.

28:50.817 --> 28:52.734
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.

28:52.819 --> 28:55.787
- I'm Roy.
- And I am Joan,

28:55.855 --> 28:57.539
from Levittown Gold and Gems.

28:57.624 --> 28:59.992
- Hmm.
- Is this, um,

29:00.043 --> 29:01.460
all the merchandise you carry?

29:01.527 --> 29:02.995
Um, is there anything
in particular

29:03.046 --> 29:04.997
that you're looking for?
I was thinking bigger.

29:05.048 --> 29:06.798
Bigger and flashier.

29:06.866 --> 29:08.867
- Bigger?
- It's Long Island.

29:08.918 --> 29:10.869
Of course.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.143
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:24.484 --> 29:26.401
Here we are.

29:29.405 --> 29:32.407
Those are gorgeous.

29:32.492 --> 29:34.276
Oh.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.745
Are you all right?

29:36.829 --> 29:40.065
God, this is so embarrassing.

29:40.116 --> 29:41.700
Would I be able to use
your ladies room?

29:41.751 --> 29:43.285
Normally, no, but--

29:43.369 --> 29:45.871
But you'll make an exception
for the lady who's about to pop?

29:45.922 --> 29:48.406
- It's back here.
- Aw, you're so sweet.

29:48.458 --> 29:51.043
Thank you so much.

29:51.094 --> 29:52.243
- This way.
- Okay.

29:52.295 --> 29:54.346
Right.

29:56.182 --> 29:57.582
It's, uh, right over here.

29:57.634 --> 29:59.851
Oh, great.
Thank you.

30:03.139 --> 30:06.608
Roy, Brinks is here for you.

30:35.755 --> 30:38.056
So, everything's out of
the container?

30:38.124 --> 30:39.925
Yes.
It's all in the vault.

30:39.976 --> 30:41.176
You got your delivery
instructions?

30:41.260 --> 30:42.460
Yeah.

30:42.512 --> 30:44.295
Uh, mid-levels, escalators,

30:44.347 --> 30:46.314
Hollywood Road platform,
Hong Kong.

30:46.399 --> 30:49.317
The day after next at 10:00 a.m.

30:49.402 --> 30:52.487
All right.
I'm on my way.

31:01.614 --> 31:03.532
I think I found just what
you're looking for.

31:03.616 --> 31:06.418
I'm sorry.
I forgot something in my car.

31:06.485 --> 31:09.504
I'll be right back.

31:14.093 --> 31:15.377
Annie?

31:15.461 --> 31:17.379
You're alive.

31:23.379 --> 31:24.944
Joan, what are you doing here?

31:26.876 --> 31:29.344
Henry's money.
I'm looking for his courier.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.931
- Is he here?
- He's right behind me.

31:32.999 --> 31:35.500
That's him.

31:35.551 --> 31:37.502
- Well, Joan--
- Annie, Annie, come here!

31:44.110 --> 31:45.527
I overheard them talking.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.362
There's a meet scheduled
in Hong Kong

31:47.447 --> 31:49.398
the day after next.
I know the location.

31:52.852 --> 31:55.454
Thanks.

31:57.907 --> 31:59.858
Ow.

32:02.528 --> 32:03.695
What happened?

32:03.746 --> 32:07.582
Oh, uh, a car crash.
I must not have felt it.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.334
Car crash?

32:09.385 --> 32:11.226
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Oh, no, no, no.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.255
Trust me.

32:13.339 --> 32:15.257
It's not a good idea.

32:21.180 --> 32:23.565
Okay.
I think I got everything.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.567
How are you feeling?
I can't stop thinking about

32:25.652 --> 32:28.603
that courier on the way
to Hong Kong with Henry's money.

32:28.688 --> 32:30.822
We can't let Henry follow.

32:30.890 --> 32:34.392
You know how hard it's gonna be
to get Henry out of Hong Kong.

32:34.444 --> 32:35.661
The Chinese will grant
him asylum,

32:35.728 --> 32:37.029
and he will be untouchable.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.747
Sit still, Annie.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.732
You need to get him
into custody right now.

32:40.783 --> 32:42.067
With what evidence?

32:42.118 --> 32:44.369
We already know
all the pieces.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.921
He stole money from the CIA.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.789
He's responsible for Copenhagen.

32:47.874 --> 32:50.208
Someone can get him to talk.

32:50.259 --> 32:53.178
Well, I don't have
that power anymore.

32:55.631 --> 32:56.882
Calder does.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.601
Who's that from?

32:59.686 --> 33:01.386
Henry Wilcox.

33:01.437 --> 33:02.938
Everything in here is top-shelf.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.640
Wine, truffles, Johnnie Blue.

33:05.725 --> 33:07.943
Everyone he works with
looks exactly like him.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.945
Well, except for you.

33:11.731 --> 33:13.648
I don't work with him.

33:15.318 --> 33:18.653
Then why the gift basket?

33:18.738 --> 33:20.622
Go.

33:20.707 --> 33:21.623
Calder Michaels.

33:21.708 --> 33:22.874
Hi, Calder.
It's Joan.

33:22.942 --> 33:24.609
We have a lot to talk about,

33:24.660 --> 33:27.112
but I'm not gonna get
into all that right now.

33:27.163 --> 33:28.547
What are we gonna get into?

33:28.614 --> 33:30.582
I need a TAC team
to round up Henry Wilcox

33:30.633 --> 33:32.584
and stick him in a box.

33:34.670 --> 33:38.006
Can you do that?

33:38.091 --> 33:40.008
Why the hell not?

33:42.395 --> 33:44.062
Hey, man.
How'd you find me?

33:44.130 --> 33:45.430
Hey.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.733
I knocked on the other
contracting van first.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.818
There isn't another one,
is there?

33:49.902 --> 33:51.302
Barber, what do you got?

33:51.354 --> 33:54.656
Oh, uh, he's still hunkered
down in there.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.274
- He's still alone?
- Yeah.

33:56.325 --> 33:59.161
Well, he had a pizza delivered.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.529
Did you track
the delivery guy?

34:00.613 --> 34:02.480
What if he brought something in
or took something out?

34:02.532 --> 34:04.149
Track the delivery guy?

34:04.200 --> 34:06.418
Me and what army, Auggie?
He brought in a pizza.

34:06.485 --> 34:07.919
He took out 20 bucks.
I can't follow everyone.

34:07.987 --> 34:09.821
Hey, relax, Barber.
It's just a question.

34:09.871 --> 34:11.039
Sorry.

34:11.123 --> 34:13.759
It's just my first day ever
without pizza.

34:13.826 --> 34:15.627
All right, you said you built
a security profile?

34:15.678 --> 34:16.828
Yeah, yeah.

34:16.879 --> 34:18.013
I found an override for
the perimeter fence.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.380
I can shut down the cameras,

34:19.465 --> 34:21.166
put 'em on a loop
<i>Ocean's 11</i> style.

34:21.217 --> 34:22.217
Great.

34:22.301 --> 34:23.768
Yeah, that's great.
Thank you.

34:23.835 --> 34:24.770
Cool, man.
So, what are we doing?

34:24.837 --> 34:26.938
Buggin' the place?

34:27.005 --> 34:28.723
You did great work, Barber.

34:28.808 --> 34:29.891
I'll take it from here.

34:29.976 --> 34:32.310
No, I'm here to help.
What do you need?

34:32.360 --> 34:35.480
Hey, you've been
a good friend,

34:35.531 --> 34:37.482
but you got to go.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.876
What kind of team did
you bring with you?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.378
I'm trying to protect you
from that answer, and I'd feel

34:50.463 --> 34:52.297
a hell of a lot better
if you weren't here for this.

34:52.364 --> 34:53.380
Oh, man.
You don't want to do this.

34:53.466 --> 34:55.382
Go home, Barber.

34:57.170 --> 34:59.087
I hope you know what you're
doing, man.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.145
Okay, boys.

35:07.213 --> 35:08.880
On my cue.

35:30.786 --> 35:33.622
Move out.

35:43.349 --> 35:46.017
We're in.

35:46.085 --> 35:48.520
What the hell?
Auggie, it's not Wilcox.

35:48.587 --> 35:49.721
Hold on a sec.

35:49.772 --> 35:50.689
What do you mean,
"hold on a second"?

35:50.756 --> 35:51.773
What's goin' on?

35:51.858 --> 35:52.774
And what do you mean
it's not Wilcox?

35:52.859 --> 35:53.942
We're bringing him out.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.944
Looks like we got company.

35:56.028 --> 35:58.196
What's goin' on?
I need a status update.

36:01.484 --> 36:02.767
What the hell is this?

36:02.818 --> 36:04.402
Stand down, soldier.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.154
What the hell
is Calder doing there?

36:06.239 --> 36:07.519
Looks like
the same thing we are.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.107
I said stand down.

36:09.158 --> 36:10.275
We're coming out.

36:10.326 --> 36:11.710
You got Henry?

36:11.777 --> 36:13.712
No.
He set up a decoy.

36:17.449 --> 36:19.384
Where the hell is Henry?

36:25.909 --> 36:27.157
What the hell you doing?

36:27.158 --> 36:28.554
I thought Henry was
a flight risk.

36:28.555 --> 36:29.763
I was bringing him into custody.

36:29.764 --> 36:31.381
That's what I was doing.

36:31.432 --> 36:32.915
What you were doin'
was personal.

36:32.967 --> 36:36.136
This is personal for me
in ways you don't get.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.021
Yeah, you're right.
I don't get it.

36:38.088 --> 36:40.190
I don't get it.

36:48.816 --> 36:53.737
Don't go off the reservation,
Auggie.

36:53.788 --> 36:55.655
You hear me?

36:55.740 --> 36:58.041
We need you.
You're way too valuable.

37:01.879 --> 37:03.797
What brought you
down here now?

37:06.050 --> 37:09.169
I got a phone call.

37:09.253 --> 37:12.455
From who?

37:12.506 --> 37:13.673
How's Arthur doing?

37:13.758 --> 37:15.958
Well, he's still grieving Teo.

37:16.010 --> 37:18.728
I can't seem to help him
through that.

37:18.796 --> 37:20.680
Well, you're giving him
another son.

37:20.765 --> 37:22.005
It's hard to be joyful
right now

37:22.066 --> 37:24.651
with so much going on at home.

37:24.735 --> 37:26.469
You coming back
would help a lot.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.905
I can't come back
until Henry's finished.

37:28.972 --> 37:31.474
I know, but we're close.

37:36.113 --> 37:37.647
You need any cash?

37:37.698 --> 37:40.867
Yeah, actually I do.
I'm running pretty low.

37:40.951 --> 37:42.919
Okay.
I'll stop at an ATM.

37:42.986 --> 37:44.921
Thanks.

37:47.792 --> 37:52.178
Joan, what's the protocol for
a spy coming in from the cold?

37:56.017 --> 38:00.720
Normally it's about six months
of briefings and evaluations.

38:00.805 --> 38:02.171
You get a physical,

38:02.223 --> 38:05.174
and somebody follows you around
for about a year.

38:05.226 --> 38:06.342
You said, "normally."
What if--

38:06.394 --> 38:08.645
what happens when
it's not normal?

38:08.696 --> 38:10.647
There's no precedent.

38:12.867 --> 38:15.568
I was actually looking into that
for Helen.

38:15.653 --> 38:18.872
- Helen wanted to come in?
- Yeah.

38:20.541 --> 38:22.075
Should I not have told you that?

38:22.159 --> 38:25.495
I've been struggling
with being away.

38:28.666 --> 38:30.032
I always thought Helen
was good at it.

38:30.084 --> 38:34.220
Maybe she was just good
at pretending.

38:36.257 --> 38:38.508
It's Calder Michaels.

38:38.559 --> 38:41.394
Yeah?

38:41.479 --> 38:43.813
What?
When?

38:43.881 --> 38:45.515
Okay.
Thank you.

38:45.566 --> 38:46.599
Did they get Henry?

38:46.684 --> 38:49.736
No.
He set up a decoy in his house.

38:49.820 --> 38:51.738
No one can find him.

38:55.276 --> 38:59.028
I'm really sorry, Annie.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.448
How can you get me
to Hong Kong?

39:12.460 --> 39:13.760
Henry went to
some pretty great lengths

39:13.844 --> 39:15.378
to make it seem like
he wasn't going anywhere.

39:15.429 --> 39:17.580
Which would suggest
he's up to something

39:17.631 --> 39:18.765
worth going
to great lengths for.

39:18.849 --> 39:21.718
That it does.
How you feeling?

39:21.769 --> 39:24.086
I heard you took a hit.
Not too bad.

39:24.138 --> 39:26.055
And how are you gonna avoid
taking one?

39:26.107 --> 39:28.758
You don't call a TAC team
on Henry without consequence.

39:28.809 --> 39:30.310
What sort of protections have
you arranged?

39:30.394 --> 39:32.395
You're looking at 'em.

39:32.446 --> 39:33.730
If we don't come back
with anything,

39:33.781 --> 39:35.932
this is basically
a one-way trip.

39:37.601 --> 39:39.869
Annie, can you give us
a minute?

39:39.937 --> 39:42.989
Sure.
I'll go take my seat.

39:43.073 --> 39:44.040
Thanks, Joan.

39:44.107 --> 39:46.042
Fly safe.

39:50.214 --> 39:53.833
You know, the first few months
of us working together,

39:53.918 --> 39:58.638
I resented you, and the last
few months, I've hated you.

39:59.890 --> 40:02.592
Are you apologizing?
Because you suck at it.

40:07.264 --> 40:10.900
Calder, I'm sorry.

40:10.968 --> 40:13.186
Apology accepted.

40:14.355 --> 40:16.573
It wasn't easy filling
your shoes.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.408
All right.

40:18.475 --> 40:21.945
And thank you.

40:21.996 --> 40:24.614
Thank you for Annie.

40:24.665 --> 40:26.616
The girl can be persuasive.

40:34.508 --> 40:38.294
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:38.345 --> 40:40.096
Joan thought you could use
a tech out there.

40:40.163 --> 40:41.965
Yeah, she told me.

40:42.016 --> 40:43.967
And when she told you,
you were, uh--

40:46.136 --> 40:48.221
I know you've always got
my back.

40:50.674 --> 40:52.692
I do.

40:56.614 --> 41:01.651
I, uh, took this
the other night.

41:05.039 --> 41:06.990
I'm not entirely sure why.

41:19.536 --> 41:21.471
Thank you.

41:28.596 --> 41:30.546
I was scared I lost you.

41:36.720 --> 41:40.222
You know when I was scared?

41:40.274 --> 41:42.075
When?

41:42.159 --> 41:44.393
When I knocked on your door
and you asked who it was,

41:44.445 --> 41:47.730
and I didn't know the answer.

41:56.507 --> 41:58.424
We all good?

41:58.449 --> 42:03.449
