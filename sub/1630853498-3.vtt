WEBVTT

00:25.600 --> 00:27.280
-Whoo, sorry, sorry!

00:28.520 --> 00:29.560
What are you doing?

00:29.640 --> 00:31.440
No, nothing,
I was just seeing if--

00:31.520 --> 00:33.840
Ari, why are you
creeping around Summer's room?

00:33.920 --> 00:35.760
Well I'm not creeping.

00:35.840 --> 00:36.840
I wasn't creeping.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.160
Summer, are you okay?

00:38.240 --> 00:40.680
Yeah I woke up before
anything terrible happened.

00:40.760 --> 00:41.960
I was just seeing

00:41.960 --> 00:43.280
if you wanted to
come for a surf.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.480
Are you insane?

00:44.560 --> 00:45.760
What time is it?

00:45.840 --> 00:47.120
5:18 a.m.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.560
Yeah, I don't think
that's actually a time.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.080
Ari just because
you want to go surfing

00:50.160 --> 00:51.440
doesn't mean
that Summer does.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.720
And she's taking me skating.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.760
Later! Much later!

00:54.840 --> 00:56.480
I was just trying to be nice.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.280
Two for you, one for you.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.760
Here we go groms,
your sensei has arrived.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.600
Hey, Pops.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.160
You've got me on beginner
classes all week.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.960
Yeah, school holidays Pops,
all hands on deck.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.360
Excuse me?

01:51.440 --> 01:54.080
Jackson Bay is a week away,
and if I don't get a result,

01:54.160 --> 01:55.720
we can kiss the
state team goodbye.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.680
All right, all right, well,

01:56.760 --> 01:59.600
we'll go out for a session
at the end of the day, okay?

01:59.680 --> 02:01.000
For now, just smile.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.960
I need to go to the toilet.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.880
Yeeeww!
Pumping today boys.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.080
That one's frothing aye?

02:12.160 --> 02:12.920
Hey, Ari!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.840
Ari, you coming out
with us, mate?

02:14.920 --> 02:16.400
Yeah, I dunno.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.440
Are your folks still
putting a ban on you?

02:18.520 --> 02:19.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but hey,

02:19.560 --> 02:21.440
I was thinking maybe you
could have a chat with them.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.680
You've got so much
experience with competitions,

02:23.760 --> 02:24.880
that they'd really
listen to you.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.120
Look, I've got enough
going on in my own family

02:27.200 --> 02:29.160
without getting involved
in anyone else's.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.000
Yeah.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.520
Jackson Bay's just
going to have to wait.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.400
In the meantime, you're not
banned from training are you?

02:34.480 --> 02:35.400
Let's go, baby!

02:40.880 --> 02:43.320
Goofy, right foot on the board.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.480
Goofy.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.040
Natural.

02:47.640 --> 02:48.440
Natural.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.360
Goofy, and goofy.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.240
Now, before we hit the water,

02:54.320 --> 02:56.120
the most important
thing to remember is--

02:56.200 --> 02:57.680
Yo, watch this, Honey!

02:57.760 --> 03:00.400
All about getting
power from your legs.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.920
Don't surf alone.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.160
Stick with the group.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.040
If I can see you,
I can keep you safe.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.720
Yeah, let's go Honey.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.960
No guts, no glory!

03:09.680 --> 03:12.040
I am a wedge-tailed eagle
ready to soar!

03:12.120 --> 03:13.520
Yeah! Come on.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.240
Yikes.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.680
It's all right, I'm okay.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.640
Yeah!

03:19.720 --> 03:21.080
Took that fall like a boss!

03:22.480 --> 03:24.800
Hey! We're doing
five waves in 30 minutes.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.240
Let's see you surf
like it's a heat!

04:50.240 --> 04:52.520
Okay, it's a good thing we've
got a week till Jackson Bay

04:52.600 --> 04:55.160
because we have got some
serious work to do, fam.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.640
Okay, so,

04:56.720 --> 04:59.280
Bodhi, you picked a
beauty here, right?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.360
Oh, sick top turn.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.680
Weird look on your face.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.480
Yeah, but you quit
too early here.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.040
That section
out wide goes begging,

05:08.120 --> 05:09.640
but we can work on that.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.360
Next, Ari.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.560
Let's skip ahead.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.840
I want to take a look
at that left-hander.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.960
You're bottom
turn's super weak.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.480
Yeah, yeah, which is
fair enough after a year off.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.360
And you probably
aren't turning your head enough.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.960
Your physio gave you
the all clear, right?

05:24.040 --> 05:24.840
Yeah, of course.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.080
'Cause you're looking a bit
tentative out there, brother.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.160
Don't worry, I'll give you
some tapes to watch, yeah?

05:29.240 --> 05:31.280
And I'm giving you all
a workout programme.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.120
Great session, guys.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.160
Boards back in the rack,
then go get changed.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.240
If you want Honey
to learn anything,

05:42.320 --> 05:44.720
you can't just ignore her
while you do your thing.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.800
Why not? It's how I learned.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.480
It's okay Poppy.
We're just having fun.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.360
Oh wait,

05:49.440 --> 05:50.640
or maybe I could do your
whole drill sergeant thing.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.760
Super fun.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.920
I've got another class coming.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.720
Sorry, but you need
to go somewhere else.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.680
Who needs school to learn

05:56.760 --> 05:59.800
how to stand up on a
board anyways? Super easy.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.760
Oh yeah?

06:00.840 --> 06:03.720
Surfing takes
commitment and patience.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.160
As far as I can tell
you have neither.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.240
Wow. I could see why
they made you a teacher.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.880
So inspirational.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.000
If you ask me,

06:13.080 --> 06:15.880
this whole operation is a
con-job run by children.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.920
Where are the adults?

06:19.080 --> 06:21.920
Dad's away. Mum's dead.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.200
You made me look like
a terrible person.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.080
No you did that all by yourself.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.280
This sounds dramatic.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.840
Ari didn't tell Summer
about Poppy's mum dying.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.040
How is that my job to bring up?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.320
My best guess is that he's
not comfortable discussing it

06:39.400 --> 06:40.520
because it triggers
feelings of guilt

06:40.600 --> 06:41.600
of him missing the funeral.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.720
But I couldn't go.
I was injured.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.520
Yeah but your legs worked.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.440
None of them came to
visit me in the hospital.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.840
Poppy included.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.440
Her mum died.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.240
Dad, do you want
help with anything?

06:57.320 --> 06:58.800
Potatoes aren't going
to peel themselves.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.920
Great.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.640
Come here. Let's look. Up.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.680
Oh, we are going to need some
serious antiseptic on those.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.520
Yeah, but now I know
how to grind a rail.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.760
Yeah. You can.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.680
That Summer girl
may have some issues.

07:52.760 --> 07:53.600
Totally.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.600
Me and Marlon are going to
Farouk's, if you want to come.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.520
Apparently they're
selling vegan burgers now.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.480
Maybe. I'll probably
be another 45.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.560
20.

08:04.640 --> 08:05.400
Please.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.120
Hey Bods.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.440
Anyway.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.320
Thanks for today Manu.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.600
Aye, all good.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.680
You did well today.
Same time tomorrow?

08:18.760 --> 08:19.880
Yup. See ya.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.640
Did you get out for
a surf in the end?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.040
Fix up that backhand?

08:25.120 --> 08:28.480
No. By the time I
finished all my classes,

08:28.560 --> 08:29.720
it was completely flat.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.080
Okay. Well.

08:36.560 --> 08:38.440
Hey sorry you missed
video reviews today.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.520
We'll find time again when
the swell picks up. Yeah?

08:42.600 --> 08:43.760
Yep, whenever.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.640
Okay. So what do we
need to remember?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.040
Don't surf alone.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.080
That's right.
Respect the ocean.

09:39.160 --> 09:43.400
The most dangerous thing out
there is being overconfident.

09:43.480 --> 09:44.800
Thinking you know everything

09:44.880 --> 09:47.600
and ending up
way over your head.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.120
Okay, lets go have some fun.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.080
Okay ready?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.440
Yes, paddle, paddle, paddle.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.880
Go, go, go,
paddle, paddle, paddle.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.880
Ready? Three, two, one.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.160
That's it!

10:23.560 --> 10:24.440
Okay, ready?

10:31.480 --> 10:33.080
Get on, get on.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.560
Ready? Paddle, paddle,
paddle, paddle.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.320
Paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle.
Go, go, go.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.080
I told you this was easy.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.280
Yes Bodhi, activate that core--

11:06.640 --> 11:09.040
Yes Bodhi, you can
do better than that.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.760
Oi! Can you try not break
the equipment please?

11:14.120 --> 11:15.760
Sorry Manu. Sorry.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.920
If you two took this
as serious as Ari,

11:18.000 --> 11:19.640
maybe you'd start winning
some competitions.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.320
Who how cares how
hard he trains?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.520
He's not allowed to surf.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.760
Getting back in the water.
See ya.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.200
Would've caught that wave
without your help by the way.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.800
Yeah, totally.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.200
Seriously, you're a
pretty good teacher.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.760
The whole tough thing, works.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.800
Nah.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.800
My mum was the best.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.840
The kids loved her.

11:55.640 --> 11:56.760
How'd she die?

11:58.920 --> 12:00.200
Lymphoma.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.680
She had it for years, but then,

12:04.080 --> 12:07.200
about six months ago
there were complications.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.400
That...

12:11.520 --> 12:13.080
...extremely sucks.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.360
You realise our mums were in
Shorehaven Boardriders together?

12:19.440 --> 12:20.560
Back in the day.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.960
Maybe your mum hated
my mum as much as I do.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.840
You're so weird.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.520
Hey, I need help with
something this arvo,

12:31.600 --> 12:32.840
and I figured you owe me.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.760
That's funny.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.240
I've got a camera
just like that.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.040
Just helping Poppy.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.680
You can take over if you want?

13:07.760 --> 13:09.880
Nah. She asked you for
a reason. You're all good.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.400
You know, mum always said
she'd be a world champ one day.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.920
She was always the optimist.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.960
She saw the potential
in people, you know.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.800
This is pathetic.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.360
It's called being helpful.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.880
Somebody's got to look after it.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.760
You're trying so hard
to win their approval,

13:39.840 --> 13:41.440
it's painful to watch.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.560
Okay.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.960
Anyway, you realise
there's a much easier way

13:44.040 --> 13:46.600
to convince your parents to
let you surf this competition.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.480
Like what?

13:49.920 --> 13:51.120
Nah, nah, nah.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.720
Summer like what!?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.600
Hey Gibsons, can I
have a quick word?

13:58.680 --> 14:00.360
Course.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.200
So I decided to get
back into surfing.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.800
What!? No!

14:05.880 --> 14:07.280
Resist!

14:08.640 --> 14:10.640
So you and Ari have
been surfing together?

14:10.720 --> 14:12.720
Yeah, exactly.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.520
Ari's been teaching me

14:13.600 --> 14:15.120
and it's all been coming
back really quickly,

14:15.200 --> 14:17.640
so I decided to enter
this next competition

14:17.720 --> 14:19.160
-at Jackson beach.
-Bay.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.080
Or whatever.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.520
That's funny.
That's a good one Summer.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.600
No you guys.
I'm not kidding.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.120
Not to blow my own
trumpet or anything,

14:25.200 --> 14:26.960
but Ari says I'm
kind of a natural.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.840
Yeah, no, yeah, no,
she's really good,

14:32.040 --> 14:34.120
and you wanted us to
spend more time together,

14:34.200 --> 14:36.920
so we thought this would
be the way to do it.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.320
Ah, so this
was all your idea?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.760
-No, no, no, no, totally not.
-This was all me.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.080
Summer, I hate to
burst your bubble,

14:43.160 --> 14:44.840
but Ari should have
definitely told you,

14:44.920 --> 14:46.000
competitions are for kids

14:46.080 --> 14:47.760
who've been surfing
for a long while.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.880
No, no. I know that.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.360
Just, I feel like this
will really bring

14:54.440 --> 14:55.920
me and my mum closer,
you know?

14:57.320 --> 14:58.400
Right.

15:02.680 --> 15:07.240
Summer, you don't need to do
competitions to enjoy surfing.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.760
There's going to be a nice
little off-shore breeze

15:08.840 --> 15:10.160
in the morning at Back Beach.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.920
Why don't we all get out
there, get a wave together.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.480
Let me see if I can find my
wetsuit, you can borrow it.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.800
I've got the perfect board
for you. Come on. Let's go.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.440
-You're with me.
-Yeah.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.360
Summer.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
This is so disappointing.

15:29.560 --> 15:33.640
Here we go.
Sweet little mini-mal.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.680
Plenty of volume.
Perfect for beginners.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.160
-You got it?
-Yeah.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.400
This thing's heavy.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.280
What?

15:47.360 --> 15:49.120
No, no, no, nothing

15:50.960 --> 15:51.680
Oh!

16:01.160 --> 16:04.280
Just helping Poppy.
You can take over if you want?

16:04.360 --> 16:06.840
Nah. She asked you for
a reason. You're all good.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.880
You know Mum always said
she'd be a world champ one day.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.880
She was always the optimist.

16:14.000 --> 16:14.840
Bruh,
I keep telling you,

16:14.920 --> 16:16.280
you got to turn
the sound bar on.

16:16.360 --> 16:19.840
Oi! I'm not doing any
beginner classes tomorrow.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.840
What? What are you talking
about? We're fully booked.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.720
So cancel! I keep telling
you I need to train,

16:24.800 --> 16:26.040
but you don't listen.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.040
Me? Not listen?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.200
I've been trying to
coach you for weeks.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.560
It's in one ear
and out the other.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.400
So? Why do you care?

16:32.480 --> 16:34.480
You don't even think
I'm that good.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.280
What?

16:35.360 --> 16:36.440
I'm going to get some popcorn.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.440
Pops, where is this coming from?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.360
"She was always the optimist."

16:44.960 --> 16:47.480
No, no I wasn't
talking about you.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.440
I was just trying to explain
to Summer how cool Mum was.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.200
Look, Dad's away so much.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.720
I'm just trying
to run this business,

16:54.800 --> 16:56.920
this family,
the best way that I can.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.120
I just, I need your help Pops.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.600
When Mum first got sick,
you weren't around,

17:01.680 --> 17:04.920
neither of you. It was just
me and her and we were fine.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.320
Well, we're here now Pops.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.680
What a cracker of a day, hey?

17:16.760 --> 17:17.960
Pity Summer couldn't come out.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.280
Yeah, she's got a
beginning class with Poppy.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.800
Ah.

17:21.880 --> 17:22.960
You kids and your thrusters.

17:23.080 --> 17:25.520
Why don't you give the fish
a go? Try something different.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.560
Maybe later.
You should take it out.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.160
What are we doing?

18:52.240 --> 18:53.480
Well, I finally got
a morning off,

18:53.560 --> 18:55.000
so I'm going to go
surf the big stuff.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.920
Yeah, great. I'll come with.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.120
Sorry, it's too gnarly
for you today.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.960
Oh, that was great mate.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
I'm really glad we did that.

19:05.120 --> 19:05.880
Yeah.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.960
How's the shoulder feeling?
Good?

19:07.040 --> 19:08.560
Yeah. Great.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.440
I was working on my
layback snap, did you see it?

19:10.520 --> 19:13.560
No mate. Bit hard to see
through the back of a wave.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.200
You got to let me
do one more comp.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.560
I'm ready.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.160
Well done.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.640
Thought we were just out
having a wave together.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.120
Obviously your head
was somewhere else.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.800
I'm doing everything
you're asking me to do,

19:27.880 --> 19:29.040
helping out around the house

19:29.120 --> 19:30.520
and trying to do
stuff with Summer--

19:30.600 --> 19:32.880
Ari, because of what
you went through,

19:32.960 --> 19:35.360
maybe you feel like the
universe owes you something,

19:35.440 --> 19:37.680
or that the people around
you owe you something.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.960
You keep treating everything
like a transaction, mate,

19:40.040 --> 19:41.760
you are going to
end up short changed.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.120
Hey!

20:39.560 --> 20:40.680
Help, Poppy!

20:56.120 --> 20:56.880
Poppy!

20:56.960 --> 20:57.800
Hang on!

21:00.120 --> 21:02.040
Get back on your board!

21:03.840 --> 21:05.720
Now don't let go!

21:26.880 --> 21:28.400
Stop, stop, stop!

21:28.480 --> 21:29.200
What?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.040
Let me out.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.720
What is it?

21:31.800 --> 21:32.840
Suggestion!

21:32.920 --> 21:35.080
You should probably tell
people not to surf alone.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.600
I should
have chained you up.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.600
Oi!

21:38.880 --> 21:39.840
What happened?

21:39.920 --> 21:41.360
Your friend just saved my life.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.680
No biggie. I just
need a lie down.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.480
I'm really sorry Pop.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.200
I should have been
at the funeral.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.440
Yeah, you should have.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.160
We did a big paddle out.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.800
Right here.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.640
It... it was beautiful.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.040
So is my brother
whipping you into shape?

22:26.240 --> 22:27.640
Yeah, I guess.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.600
Actually you know who he's
making me watch videos of,

22:30.680 --> 22:32.080
to work on my foundations?

22:33.000 --> 22:33.720
You.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.320
Really.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.240
I can't
leave it like this.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.080
Sorry?

22:44.320 --> 22:46.240
I didn't even catch one wave.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.800
I gotta get back out there.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.000
You nearly drowned.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.040
You're not scared are you?

22:51.680 --> 22:53.120
Come on. Let's go.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.520
Come on.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.760
Hey, wait up.
