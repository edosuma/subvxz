ADULT ADAM:
<i>Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.702 --> 00:03.969
<i>before you could buy</i>
<i>anything you wanted</i>
<i>with a click of a mouse,</i>

00:03.971 --> 00:06.939
<i>shopping was more</i>
<i>of a contact sport.</i>

00:06.941 --> 00:11.377
(WOMEN SHOUTING)
<i>And no one was better at it</i>
<i>than my mom.</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:17.983
Remember, dented cans
are 50% off.

00:17.985 --> 00:21.720
I made it easy for you.
They're all dented.
(CHUCKLES)

00:21.722 --> 00:23.088
Oh!

00:24.024 --> 00:25.891
Now they're all dented.
(LAUGHS)

00:25.893 --> 00:27.426
I don't care
if it is a misprint.

00:27.428 --> 00:31.063
This ad says that
that lawn mower is $9.99,

00:31.065 --> 00:33.632
and I am not leaving
until you honor this price.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.301
ADULT ADAM:
<i>There was no bargain</i>
<i>too small, too large,</i>

00:36.303 --> 00:38.670
<i>or too dangerous</i>
<i>for Beverly Goldberg.</i>

00:38.672 --> 00:42.074
<i>I'm not exaggerating.</i>
<i>This really happened.</i>

00:42.076 --> 00:43.275
Mom, they're slipping!

00:43.277 --> 00:44.209
Don't you dare let go.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.345
Use the tag!
Hold on tight!

00:46.347 --> 00:49.548
It's ripping!
It says "Do not remove!"

00:49.550 --> 00:51.250
Dad, slow down!
We can't hold them.

00:51.252 --> 00:55.287
No. Speed up.
They'll stabilize
at a higher speed.

00:55.289 --> 00:55.954
This isn't worth it!

00:55.956 --> 00:59.358
They were buy two,
get two free.
It's totally worth it.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.559
(SINGSONG) Pumpkin.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.594
Big news
about the winter formal.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.264
Found a great price
on that dress you wanted.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.033
Is it behind this picture
of a dress I don't want?

01:08.035 --> 01:11.103
Seriously, I don't want
some crappy knockoff.

01:11.304 --> 01:12.204
Dad, little help?

01:12.206 --> 01:14.339
Here's all I know
about fashion.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.941
I like blue. That's it.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.576
Then let me explain
how it works.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.344
You have to spend money
to look nice.

01:19.346 --> 01:23.482
<i>Or</i> you could grab
some of the old dresses
in your closet,

01:23.484 --> 01:28.520
cut 'em up,
and make a new one
in the current style.

01:28.522 --> 01:33.292
Like, um,
that movie with, uh,
the girl with the face.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.259
Mom, he's upsetting me.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.929
You should go.
I'll go. (CRUNCHES)

01:36.931 --> 01:38.297
(SIGHS) Look at
these prices, Erica.

01:38.299 --> 01:42.768
(LAUGHS)
It's gonna be so much fun.
Discount barn, here we come.

01:42.770 --> 01:47.439
No! No discount barn
or huts or warehouses.

01:47.441 --> 01:51.143
I'm tired of always
asking you guys for money.

01:51.145 --> 01:51.777
I'm getting a job.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.446
A job?
You're just a child.

01:54.448 --> 01:58.517
I can't have you
losing a foot
in a forklift accident.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.084
Forklift?

01:59.086 --> 02:01.787
Patty Newsome's son
got his foot crushed

02:01.789 --> 02:03.922
his first day
at the lumberyard.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.958
He'll never bike
through Europe now.

02:05.960 --> 02:06.658
Is that what you want?

02:06.660 --> 02:09.828
Brenda said she could
get me a job with her
at Gimbels, okay?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.830
I'll finally have
my own money.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.867
Plus I get
a big employee discount.

02:15.468 --> 02:19.671
ADULT ADAM:
<i>That magic word was all</i>
<i>my mom needed to hear.</i>

02:19.673 --> 02:21.874
(FANFARE PLAYING)

02:21.876 --> 02:24.610
Well, who am I
to stand in your way?

02:24.612 --> 02:27.012
That settles it.
You're getting a discount.

02:27.014 --> 02:30.149
Job. (LAUGHS)
You're getting a job.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.750
I'm just so happy for us.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.684
You. (LAUGHS)

02:32.686 --> 02:34.653
I'm happy for all of us.

02:34.854 --> 02:37.422
Oh. Discount.

02:39.025 --> 02:40.259
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

ADULT ADAM:
<i>It was November 19th,</i>
<i>1980-something,</i>

02:53.407 --> 02:56.542
<i>and like every afternoon,</i>
<i>I was spending quality time</i>

02:56.544 --> 02:59.578
<i>with my good friend</i>
<i>Nintendo.</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:02.114
Come on, slugger.
Let's hit the track.

03:02.116 --> 03:03.048
The ponies are waiting.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.784
One sec. I'm so close
to winning  <i>Zelda,</i>

03:05.786 --> 03:06.952
I can taste it.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.755
Six months of hard work
is about to pay off.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.057
You know what I did
in six months?

03:12.059 --> 03:12.958
Win World War II.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.528
(SHOUTING) I get it!
You lived a rich life!
Enough!

03:17.130 --> 03:20.232
I'm sorry. I'm under
a lot of pressure here.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.700
This game is all I have.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.570
Guess whose life
sucks a big sack of marbles.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.537
Just guess.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.939
All right, Barry,
what now?

03:26.941 --> 03:29.808
First period,
backpack rips open.
Bad luck.

03:29.810 --> 03:33.845
Second period,
I fail my pop quiz.
Super bad luck.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.215
Third period gym,
we're playing basketball,

03:36.217 --> 03:39.151
and a bird dooks
on my face.

03:39.153 --> 03:40.652
He dooks on my face!

03:40.654 --> 03:43.722
Actually, when a bird
goes poo-poo on you,

03:43.724 --> 03:44.556
it's good luck.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.225
Oh, really?
Well, after school,

03:46.227 --> 03:48.327
I asked Jen Sperling
to the winter formal,

03:48.329 --> 03:51.330
and she told me Ryan Corbett
just asked her

03:51.332 --> 03:52.297
two minutes before me.

03:52.299 --> 03:55.634
I don't just have bad luck.
I have Barry luck.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.869
Why don't you come
to the track with us?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.905
Pops, don't do that.
He's a jinx.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.874
Shut up! I'll blind you
with my fists!

04:03.343 --> 04:05.611
But he's right.
I'm the worst.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.679
POPS: Stop talking
that way.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.881
All you need
is a positive attitude,

04:09.883 --> 04:13.418
and you'll find your luck's
as good as anyone's.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.953
You think?
I know.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.389
You're sitting
on my bagel bites.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.725
What?

04:21.794 --> 04:23.562
Damn it!

04:24.597 --> 04:26.265
Stupid Barry luck!

04:26.267 --> 04:28.600
Thanks for coming.
Come back soon.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.401
How are we doing over here?

04:29.403 --> 04:32.604
Terrific. Just sold
an extended warranty
for a basketball.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.939
Nice work, Erica.
You keep that up,

04:33.941 --> 04:36.575
and pretty soon,
you'll be wearing
this vest.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.409
Well, not this exact one.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.679
There's a different style...
(SINGSONG) For the ladies.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.015

I'm not hitting on you.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.016
Okay.

Mom, what are you
doing here?
(CHUCKLES)

04:49.189 --> 04:52.524
Just wanted to come by
and see my daughter
on her first day of work.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

04:53.227 --> 04:54.893
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
And while I'm here,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.628
I picked up a couple
of essentials.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.796
Some fiddle faddle...

Turn the lights off
from bed,

05:04.204 --> 05:05.704
cologne for Pops...
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

05:05.706 --> 05:09.474
And an athletic supporter
and cup for Barry.
Look at this.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.109
(ROBOTIC VOICE)
I'm Darth Vader.

05:11.111 --> 05:16.915
Erica, I am your mother.
Give me your discount.

05:17.250 --> 05:17.716
(LAUGHS)

05:17.718 --> 05:21.219
(NORMAL VOICE)
Oh, but seriously,
give me your discount.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.321
I've only been here
an hour.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.488
I'm not even sure
how that works.

05:23.490 --> 05:28.126
The discount policy
extends to the employee's
immediate family,

05:28.128 --> 05:28.794
and that's me.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.995
How do you
even know that?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.297
Well, I took a look-see
inside the employee lounge

05:32.299 --> 05:34.566
and checked out
the handbook.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.668
Ugh. Fine.
I'll give you my discount,

05:36.670 --> 05:39.004
just as long as you
stay out of the lounge.

05:39.006 --> 05:39.604
(WHISPERS) Okay.

05:39.606 --> 05:43.275
(REGISTER BEEPS)
With the discount...
It comes to...

05:43.277 --> 05:45.010
$17.10.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.713
And... Damn it, I'm good.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.115
Mom...

05:50.316 --> 05:51.650

Yes! Yes!
Move your ass! Move it!

05:56.790 --> 05:58.156
Move it!
That's it!

05:58.158 --> 06:00.225
Yes, yes!
No!

06:00.227 --> 06:01.960
Son of a bitch!

06:04.831 --> 06:05.397
Damn it!

06:05.399 --> 06:08.867

a ketchup-colored shirt!

06:09.369 --> 06:11.136
(GROANS)

06:13.139 --> 06:15.273
Come on. I got an idea.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.576
Hey, Barry.
Barry, wait up.

06:17.578 --> 06:21.146
I lost three in a row, Pops.
Can we just go?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.547
Why would we go?

06:22.549 --> 06:26.084
You didn't lose that race.
You won.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.219
Really?
Really?

06:27.221 --> 06:29.721
Really. When I placed
your bet,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.923
I also picked the trifecta,

06:31.925 --> 06:33.825
then boxed the quinella,

06:33.827 --> 06:35.360
and wheeled the exotica.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.730
That means you win
for coming in last.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.998
That doesn't make
any sense.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.602
Of course it does.
It's like in golf.

06:43.604 --> 06:47.205
The person who gets
the lowest score wins.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.441
That does happen in golf!

06:49.443 --> 06:52.544
You just won yourself
20 bucks.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.212
Now that's Barry luck.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.381
Chili dogs on me, baby!

06:56.383 --> 06:57.482
Whoo!

06:57.484 --> 06:59.584
Told you I had a plan.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.353
Where's the snack bar?

Whoo!

you've been here this week.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.770
Actually, it's the fifth.
I came in on your day off,

07:18.772 --> 07:20.839
and Randy let me use
his discount.

07:20.841 --> 07:21.673

Oh, my God.
That would be amazing!

07:26.580 --> 07:29.581

you'd get another 10% off.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.715
Mom, you're not listening.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.417
And you're not making
with the beep-bop-boop.

07:32.419 --> 07:35.587
I'm sorry, honey.
I've gotta speed this along.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.354

Look, you've become
a really special member
of the Gimbels family.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.173
Technically,
your mom is allowed
to use your discount,

07:55.175 --> 07:57.843
but in my heart,
it just feels wrong.
I get that.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.413
You get that if you
don't get rid of her,
I will fire you?

08:01.514 --> 08:02.914
I didn't get that.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.615
But now I do.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.052
Good. Make sure
we get the mannequin back.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.559
You know, I come here
all the time.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.295
It's just standard
procedure.

08:52.498 --> 08:56.134
I honestly...don't know
how that got in there.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.736
Can you come with me,
please?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.938
Why? I didn't take it.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.773
I don't even wear
white diamonds.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.808
It's not my signature scent.

09:03.810 --> 09:04.309
Come on.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.145
Don't put your hands on me!
I have rights.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.680
We don't need
to make a scene.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.681

09:12.553 --> 09:14.686
I'd rather not
get involved, ma'am.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.255
You. I've been framed.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.057

I scored that goal.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.543
What are you talking about?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.979
My awesome luck's
going right through the TV

09:40.981 --> 09:41.880
and into the flyers.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.449
That's true. Whenever
something good happens,

09:44.451 --> 09:45.850
we call it Barry luck.

09:45.852 --> 09:46.885
Is that what
you called it

09:46.887 --> 09:49.754
when he bit
into his own hand
at dinner the other night?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right, what's
going on here?

10:24.424 --> 10:26.825
Your own daughter had me
hauled off to jail.

10:26.827 --> 10:30.495
It was the mall
security office
next to the orange Julius.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.664
It was jail.
It was small and stuffy,

10:32.666 --> 10:36.334
and they took a very
unflattering polaroid of me.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.503
Look at it. Look at it.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.904
Look at it.
Eh.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.207
Wait. Did you steal that?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.675
You were there for stealing.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.845

on tonight's

there's cold cuts
in the fridge.

I know you're trying
to make a point here,

Yes, I did look like
Roger Moore,

12:04.758 --> 12:08.927

it's time you called off
this fight?

12:08.929 --> 12:09.561
There's no fight.

'Cause it's literally
the biggest day of my life.

No. It's the game

for the last six months.

the day I had.

First I aced my math quiz.
B-minus.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.161
Then bio lab got flooded,

13:16.163 --> 13:18.463
so we had class
in the quad,

13:18.465 --> 13:20.365
where a bird
did not crap on me.

positive for a change.

you should be a lawyer."

18:04.451 --> 18:06.551
