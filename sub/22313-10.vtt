<i> Last time on</i> superstition...

00:09.637 --> 00:12.481
You know the rumors about
my family? It's all true.

00:12.524 --> 00:13.847
<i> I have a lot of vacation days</i>

00:13.859 --> 00:15.510
that you guys have
been urging me to take,

00:15.534 --> 00:17.743
so I'm cashing that in.

00:18.075 --> 00:20.996
These infernals are imprisoned
in this ring for a reason.

00:21.121 --> 00:24.519
I don't want you to sit
waiting for me to come around.

Come on, Raymond! Get
in there and fight!

00:48.632 --> 00:50.462
Come on, get in there.

00:52.472 --> 00:53.971
Ooh!

00:56.204 --> 00:58.904
Overbay, the enemy
just panned out of you.

00:58.906 --> 01:02.015
Now you gotta call home and tell
your parents that you are dead!

01:02.040 --> 01:04.394
You know why? 'Cause you got no fight!

01:04.411 --> 01:06.436
Fight, overbay! Fight!

01:08.215 --> 01:09.881
Fight!

01:19.013 --> 01:21.660
Stop! Get off, metterson! Stop!

01:33.113 --> 01:34.523
Yeah.

01:34.648 --> 01:36.897
What are you doing, Raymond? Get him.

01:36.944 --> 01:38.788
Come on, let's go!

01:50.364 --> 01:51.700
You still suck!

01:52.528 --> 01:53.727
You got lucky.

01:53.992 --> 01:55.427
You useless boot.

01:55.529 --> 01:57.349
All right everybody, fall in.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.550
Fall out!

02:23.533 --> 02:25.208
Raymond overbay!

02:25.233 --> 02:26.958
This ain't no pleasure cruise!

02:27.013 --> 02:29.652
Move! You look like a
bag of scrapped doorknobs.

02:29.677 --> 02:32.513
Go! Go! Go! Go!

02:52.519 --> 02:53.845
Hey, tilly.

02:55.622 --> 02:56.821
Hey.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.057
How'd you know it was me?

02:59.086 --> 03:00.569
That's a stupid question.

03:00.582 --> 03:01.966
Uh, where is everybody?

03:04.154 --> 03:05.935
Bea is off with relatives,

03:06.281 --> 03:08.129
Calvin's doing whatever.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.534
Aren't you supposed to be in
Aruba tanning or something?

03:11.926 --> 03:14.427
Uh... yeah, pro-tip,

03:14.631 --> 03:18.648
when you're a single lady,
going to a honeymoon spot...

03:18.700 --> 03:20.138
Not so fun.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.339
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.

03:22.394 --> 03:24.453
Yeah, so my resort was four star,

03:24.578 --> 03:26.722
and the airline lost my luggage,

03:26.734 --> 03:29.953
oh, and then it rained the whole
time so I just came home early.

03:30.590 --> 03:32.426
Oh, and yeah, and my mother died, too.

03:32.457 --> 03:35.458
- So, there's that.
- What?

03:35.918 --> 03:37.989
Yeah, I'm not really sure how or when,

03:38.026 --> 03:40.171
but they said it was
natural causes, so...

03:41.735 --> 03:43.020
I'm sorry.

03:45.839 --> 03:47.149
Are you okay?

03:47.891 --> 03:49.906
I know you and your
mother were estranged.

03:50.031 --> 03:52.026
Yeah, I thought so, too. Um...

03:52.687 --> 03:55.703
Funny thing is, her last request

03:55.734 --> 03:58.182
was to be interred here at our cemetery.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.888
So the joke's on me.

04:01.847 --> 04:03.281
Oh, gosh.

04:03.406 --> 04:05.177
Yeah, intake's tomorrow morning, so...

04:06.143 --> 04:07.280
I need a drink.

04:07.694 --> 04:08.893
Where's your good stuff?

04:12.083 --> 04:15.288
So, I've been thinking
about selling the cottonmouth.

04:15.508 --> 04:17.723
You know, the property
values the way they are.

04:17.848 --> 04:20.297
I think I'd make a killin'.

04:20.483 --> 04:21.947
What do you think?

04:22.127 --> 04:23.496
Works.

04:23.839 --> 04:26.045
Hey, everything good?

04:27.386 --> 04:28.567
Fine.

04:29.012 --> 04:30.817
How goes it with you and may?

04:31.688 --> 04:32.987
Same old.

04:33.112 --> 04:34.971
It's gettin' under your skin, huh?

04:35.298 --> 04:37.622
Little bit. No big deal.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.112
All right. Hold on, hold on.

04:39.155 --> 04:40.862
We either got to stop...

04:43.205 --> 04:45.659
Or you're gonna have to call the emts.

04:52.396 --> 04:54.065
My nephew is in trouble.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.735
He's halfway through basic training.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.631
He's not fittin' in.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.450
That's why they call it basic training.

05:00.493 --> 05:03.035
- It's not supposed to be easy.
- Yeah, I get that,

05:03.311 --> 05:06.072
but he's a scrappy kid.

05:06.277 --> 05:09.881
He's got oorah in his veins.

05:10.461 --> 05:12.167
He told me

05:12.223 --> 05:16.018
that three recruits from
his squad disappeared,

05:16.401 --> 05:20.103
just up and went awol
in the last three weeks.

05:20.474 --> 05:24.090
Like, you know that doesn't happen.

05:24.467 --> 05:26.259
He also told me that he is

05:26.506 --> 05:30.474
seeing some really weird
things like not of this world

05:30.498 --> 05:32.823
and he's afraid to talk
to anybody about it.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.922
- Okay, well, what can I do?
- You're a Hastings, aren't you?

05:35.977 --> 05:37.554
I mean, this is what you do.

05:37.733 --> 05:40.941
The unusual, the
unnatural, the paranormal.

05:43.612 --> 05:45.522
We run a funeral parlor, Travis.

05:45.572 --> 05:46.956
Seriously?

05:47.221 --> 05:50.337
I've been in la Rochelle
since before you were born.

05:50.385 --> 05:53.918
I own a bar. There are no secrets.

05:53.968 --> 05:56.508
- Where's he training?
- Camp bridges.

05:59.005 --> 06:00.433
It's like a four or five hour drive.

06:00.495 --> 06:02.220
Hey, I'll buy the snacks.

06:02.807 --> 06:05.725
How about you and I give the camp
commander and talk in the morning?

06:05.767 --> 06:07.091
Awesome.

06:07.122 --> 06:09.204
All right, but before we
do, we gotta stop by my crib,

06:09.235 --> 06:10.929
'cause I gotta get my lucky charm.

06:11.255 --> 06:14.306
- Still got one of those?
- Hell yes, still got one of those.

06:14.409 --> 06:17.097
My grandfather found a
silver coin in Germany

06:17.104 --> 06:19.111
and carried it throughout the war.

06:19.213 --> 06:22.102
When I left for boot
camp, he gave it to me.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.118
He passed away while I was in basic.

06:26.367 --> 06:29.187
But when I see Evan,
I'm givin' it to him.

06:29.312 --> 06:31.122
I keep mine
next to my ka-bar.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.892
Great choice, Mr. grumpy.

06:53.114 --> 06:55.122
Jason?

06:55.725 --> 06:59.052
- Jason?
- I'm busy, boot.

07:29.110 --> 07:32.328
Order arms!

07:34.850 --> 07:36.891
It's true. We've had our fair share

07:36.901 --> 07:38.711
of article 86 with this recruit class

07:38.721 --> 07:40.554
but no more than usual.

07:41.390 --> 07:43.147
Four recruits going ua,

07:43.399 --> 07:45.268
especially, this late in training...

07:45.327 --> 07:46.613
Is not unusual?

07:46.662 --> 07:48.329
These things ebb and flow.

07:48.823 --> 07:51.999
And these recruits, they
know the consequences.

07:52.101 --> 07:54.198
For instance, this recruit
that walked away a few days ago,

07:54.203 --> 07:56.358
he knows he's got 30
days to turn himself in

07:56.372 --> 07:58.282
before he spends the rest of his life

07:58.407 --> 08:00.724
looking over his shoulder as a deserter.

08:00.743 --> 08:02.549
That's assuming he's the last.

08:02.944 --> 08:04.220
As my old man would say,

08:04.250 --> 08:06.113
you are whistling past
a graveyard, commander?

08:06.215 --> 08:07.803
So, let me ask you a question.

08:08.184 --> 08:11.477
What if these recruits
didn't just go awol?

08:11.720 --> 08:13.520
What if it was...

08:13.772 --> 08:16.635
Someone or something
that lured them away?

08:16.714 --> 08:17.859
Something?

08:18.425 --> 08:20.086
Everyone knows...

08:20.429 --> 08:23.735
That camp bridges is the most haunted

08:23.774 --> 08:26.266
military installation in the country.

08:26.368 --> 08:28.264
Even worse than levinworth.

08:28.314 --> 08:30.850
I don't have time for
ghost stories, gentlemen.

08:30.906 --> 08:33.544
Come on, colonel, I'm former military.

08:33.583 --> 08:35.159
And we both know

08:35.220 --> 08:39.446
that hooky-spooky's attached to
every single building on this base.

08:39.548 --> 08:41.232
What is this about?

08:41.796 --> 08:44.684
Are you looking for special treatment
for your nephew, Mr. buchard.

08:44.704 --> 08:47.321
- No.
- Am I under investigation?

08:47.423 --> 08:49.323
No, ma'am. We're just here to help.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.429
May I have a word with you in private?

08:51.469 --> 08:54.294
Anything you have to say to
me, you can say in front of him.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.274
So you think.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.949
I'll be outside smoking a j.

09:08.319 --> 09:09.728
I don't have time for games.

09:09.778 --> 09:11.244
What's the real reason you're here?

09:11.347 --> 09:13.606
You have a hell of a
recruit retention problem.

09:13.630 --> 09:16.291
- I'm well aware.
- One more goes ua,

09:16.346 --> 09:18.969
the base will be on lockdown,
training will be suspended,

09:19.006 --> 09:21.226
and criminal investigation
command takes over.

09:21.244 --> 09:24.428
And my career advancement hits
a brick wall. I'm well aware.

09:24.493 --> 09:27.080
I have experiences and resources

09:27.096 --> 09:29.157
outside the normal
scope of the military.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.882
I'm not the enemy.

09:34.434 --> 09:35.602
Let me help you, colonel.

09:37.473 --> 09:39.740
I can give you and your friend

09:39.842 --> 09:42.463
48 hours unrestricted access

09:42.478 --> 09:44.845
before people start asking questions.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.339
That's all we need.

09:46.882 --> 09:49.095
Okay, so, hear me out.

09:49.299 --> 09:52.488
My mom's gone, I have the
place to myself for the weekend,

09:52.685 --> 09:54.731
I was thinking you
and I throw a kickback.

09:54.768 --> 09:58.594
I mean, Calvin said no parties
but I have so much dirt on him,

09:58.609 --> 10:01.044
it'd be mutually assured destruction.

10:01.530 --> 10:02.562
Yeah.

10:03.198 --> 10:04.443
Okay.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.971
So maybe kickback's kinda
lame. I get it. I mean,

10:07.021 --> 10:10.103
I do have the ideal
party/movie situation.

10:10.205 --> 10:11.700
Go big or go home, right?

10:12.941 --> 10:14.941
Russ, are you even listening to me?

10:16.512 --> 10:17.572
Huh?

10:17.609 --> 10:20.415
You're just
like my dad sometimes.

10:20.464 --> 10:22.356
I mean, where'd you even disappeared to?

10:22.844 --> 10:24.816
Why do chicks always say that?

10:25.279 --> 10:26.534
I'm not a chick.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.043
If you don't want me to say
that, don't disappear on me.

10:29.544 --> 10:31.274
I mean, what's going on with you?

10:32.653 --> 10:33.927
You.

10:34.723 --> 10:35.829
Me?

10:37.166 --> 10:39.000
You and your whole family.

10:39.902 --> 10:42.987
My family is a bunch of
hayseed roofers and farmers.

10:43.011 --> 10:45.058
You come from a family of Ghostbusters.

10:45.074 --> 10:47.421
Like, you're an x-man lady. Me...

10:47.965 --> 10:49.485
I drive an uber.

10:50.546 --> 10:51.912
As much as I love you, I...

10:52.014 --> 10:53.836
I'm never gonna be a part of your world.

10:54.249 --> 10:55.795
Did you just say you love me?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.038
I... I don't believe so.

10:59.443 --> 11:02.266
You got me talking all
squishy, I hate talking squishy.

11:02.391 --> 11:03.889
Russ, my family is complicated.

11:03.918 --> 11:06.517
- So is everyone's.
- No. Look...

11:07.537 --> 11:09.228
I'm afraid, if I show you everything,

11:09.298 --> 11:11.031
you might not be able to handle it.

11:13.688 --> 11:14.801
Garvey...

11:17.144 --> 11:18.438
I don't scare easy.

11:19.374 --> 11:22.521
Show me what you can do. I
wanna understand your powers.

11:23.511 --> 11:24.858
So do I.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.487
These seem a lot cushier
than when I was in training.

11:33.589 --> 11:36.490
Well, try on boot camp 78'.

11:36.592 --> 11:39.787
No shit. There I was, Saigon.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.753
Hey, squadly!

11:42.457 --> 11:44.757
- Good to see you, kid.
- You too.

11:44.775 --> 11:47.413
Uh, Calvin, this is my nephew.

11:47.878 --> 11:51.071
Evan, soon to be third
generation military.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.580
Evan,

11:52.797 --> 11:55.909
this is gunnery sergeant Calvin
Hastings, us marine corps.

11:56.011 --> 11:57.717
It's good to meet you, sir.

11:58.113 --> 11:59.596
Don't call me sir.

11:59.721 --> 12:00.999
I work for a living.

12:02.353 --> 12:04.256
I... I don't have much time.

12:04.294 --> 12:06.320
I have to be in my duty
station in ten minutes.

12:06.321 --> 12:08.280
Tell Calvin what you've told me.

12:10.092 --> 12:12.353
It's okay, he's cool.

12:12.594 --> 12:15.139
I have experience in
the unexplained. So...

12:15.264 --> 12:17.151
What others won't believe,

12:17.367 --> 12:18.510
I might.

12:22.733 --> 12:24.704
There's something not right around here.

12:24.807 --> 12:27.807
I mean, it's boot camp, so
you're almost never alone, but...

12:28.494 --> 12:30.496
Even when I am,

12:30.941 --> 12:33.814
I feel like there's someone
in the room with me...

12:34.710 --> 12:36.175
Someone bad.

12:36.518 --> 12:37.998
Tell him about the dude.

12:38.821 --> 12:40.081
Jason.

12:40.689 --> 12:43.598
Another recruit, real Jack off.

12:44.660 --> 12:46.840
- Sorry, sir.
- Keep going.

12:46.859 --> 12:48.633
I couldn't sleep.

12:49.198 --> 12:52.316
I saw Jason go into the
latrine for the longest while.

12:53.608 --> 12:56.859
Then I heard banging
on the toilet stall.

12:57.506 --> 12:59.090
I mean, I checked it myself,

12:59.133 --> 13:02.052
the walls were damn near
knocked off the hinges.

13:02.177 --> 13:05.345
And... no Jason.

13:06.081 --> 13:08.471
The mps chalked it up to vandalism

13:08.596 --> 13:10.884
and now we all have fire
suppression for punishment.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.460
But you don't believe
the vandalism story?

13:14.489 --> 13:17.525
I believe that there's
something coming after us...

13:18.125 --> 13:19.497
One by one.

13:19.622 --> 13:21.796
Why didn't you try to help the guy?

13:22.497 --> 13:23.663
The truth...

13:27.069 --> 13:28.713
I didn't wanna be next.

13:35.210 --> 13:36.656
Did you see anything?

13:37.225 --> 13:38.578
Did you...

13:39.221 --> 13:41.459
Hear or smell anything

13:42.120 --> 13:44.084
that might be outside the ordinary?

13:45.153 --> 13:46.353
No.

13:47.923 --> 13:49.022
No, wait.

13:49.124 --> 13:53.202
When I went into the
latrine, the air, it felt...

13:53.327 --> 13:55.026
Electric.

13:55.852 --> 14:00.179
- Tingly, you know... like, before...
- A lightning strike.

14:00.202 --> 14:01.601
Yes, sir.

14:02.704 --> 14:06.267
- Thanks. That's all.
- Yes, sir.

14:10.245 --> 14:13.680
Susan was such a kind and wise woman.

14:13.782 --> 14:16.227
Everyone knew they could
bring their troubles to her

14:16.251 --> 14:18.328
and she'd take them on as her own.

14:19.221 --> 14:21.788
She was taken away from us too soon.

14:22.724 --> 14:25.043
Congestive heart failure, they said.

14:25.059 --> 14:26.826
She was barely 60.

14:28.096 --> 14:32.201
Life has a way of reminding us
to cherish the ones we truly love

14:32.668 --> 14:34.929
while they're still
on this physical plane.

14:35.281 --> 14:37.531
She had such a hard life.

14:37.859 --> 14:41.216
Poverty, life-threatening child birth,

14:41.243 --> 14:43.410
divorce, more than once.

14:43.512 --> 14:46.012
Becoming wiccan saved her life.

14:46.114 --> 14:48.163
Then we'll honor her passing.

14:48.682 --> 14:51.037
We're very familiar
with the wiccan customs.

14:51.453 --> 14:54.720
In fact, we have a section of
our cemetery devoted to the faith.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.717
As executor of her will,

14:56.758 --> 14:59.301
Susan's burial must
follow strict guidelines.

14:59.328 --> 15:01.989
No embalming, no casket, no autopsy,

15:02.008 --> 15:03.652
body buried in a shroud.

15:04.099 --> 15:05.711
I know it all too well.

15:06.168 --> 15:08.784
You'll find someone
to oversee her remains?

15:08.837 --> 15:10.020
I'll do it myself.

15:11.406 --> 15:12.572
Are you sure?

15:12.697 --> 15:13.773
It's my job.

15:15.310 --> 15:16.745
But why here?

15:17.289 --> 15:20.111
I mean, Georgia is a big state,
there's a lot of other funeral homes.

15:20.141 --> 15:21.347
Why ours?

15:22.830 --> 15:26.119
Well, that's hardly a
question for today, is it?

15:26.472 --> 15:28.407
From what I understand,

15:28.629 --> 15:32.716
the millstone around her heart was
the way she treated you as a child.

15:33.161 --> 15:35.213
Well, it's too little too late.

15:36.465 --> 15:39.509
Tilly, I can finish up with Diana here.

15:39.701 --> 15:42.723
You don't think I don't
remember who you are.

15:44.573 --> 15:47.482
She's not just the executor
to my mother's will, Isaac,

15:47.501 --> 15:49.640
she's the high priestess of her coven.

15:49.677 --> 15:52.440
And that's no reason for
us to not be gracious.

15:52.481 --> 15:57.150
You built a wedge between me
and my mother all these years.

15:57.252 --> 16:01.320
I thought it best for both
of you to have a clean break.

16:01.723 --> 16:04.581
Well, that turned out
really well, didn't it?

16:07.162 --> 16:09.542
But you're all about
maintaining numbers.

16:10.565 --> 16:12.343
So you came here to ask me back

16:12.367 --> 16:13.974
to take my mother's place.

16:14.369 --> 16:15.872
Tell me I'm wrong.

16:17.639 --> 16:19.774
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- Tilly.

16:21.476 --> 16:22.955
I'm leaving.

16:31.613 --> 16:32.808
We have a lot of ground to cover,

16:32.820 --> 16:34.260
so what am I dealing with here?

16:34.291 --> 16:37.054
Is it a changeling, a qareen, a wraith?

16:37.669 --> 16:40.454
<i>From what you've told me, you're
probably dealing with a jinn.</i>

16:40.872 --> 16:43.230
<i>Especially, given the
electrified air disturbances.</i>

16:43.539 --> 16:46.796
<i>That still covers a
variety of creatures.</i>

16:46.921 --> 16:49.348
Well, I'm on a military base. So,

16:49.386 --> 16:52.030
could there be a war
like connection between

16:52.098 --> 16:54.127
the jinn and the missing recruits?

16:54.252 --> 16:55.856
<i>That's where I'd start.</i>

16:55.881 --> 16:58.730
<i>All the disappearances have
been of a violent nature.</i>

16:59.858 --> 17:02.086
<i>You probably dealing with a shiqq, son.</i>

17:02.104 --> 17:03.272
A shiqq.

17:03.463 --> 17:06.258
- That's a new one on me.
- <i>It's a lower form of jinn.</i>

17:06.298 --> 17:07.973
<i>It's half human, half creature.</i>

17:08.013 --> 17:10.517
<i>Uh, very monstrous in appearance.</i>

17:10.931 --> 17:12.340
<i> You want me to
come out there with you?</i>

17:12.353 --> 17:14.164
Training wheels will have
to come off at some point.

17:14.194 --> 17:15.654
I took some protective measures

17:15.665 --> 17:17.589
from the alchemy room before I left.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.496
<i>I want you to be very careful, Calvin.</i>

17:21.532 --> 17:23.567
<i>Shiqq are master shapeshifters,</i>

17:23.580 --> 17:25.166
<i>they behave like a chameleon.</i>

17:25.223 --> 17:27.584
<i>They can hide themselves
within an object or a person.</i>

17:27.621 --> 17:29.253
Betcha.

17:29.378 --> 17:30.989
<i>You got someone there with you?</i>

17:31.329 --> 17:33.890
Hey, Isaac. It's me, Travis.

17:35.854 --> 17:39.106
Hey, pop, I'll catch up later.

17:40.201 --> 17:42.465
We have to talk to
everyone in Evan's squad.

17:42.488 --> 17:44.329
And we only have about
14 hours to do it.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.573
I got to ask you this,
do you Hastings know

17:46.604 --> 17:48.780
what the government's hiding in area 51?

17:49.307 --> 17:50.721
<i> Okay, show me what you got?</i>

17:50.770 --> 17:52.109
<i>Like, can you make yourself invincible?</i>

17:52.129 --> 17:54.243
Oh, can you shatter all the windows?

17:54.285 --> 17:55.670
I'll start slow.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.790
Like, bringing a goldfish back to life.

17:58.097 --> 17:59.160
Look,

17:59.589 --> 18:02.180
I can do small things. I think.

18:03.623 --> 18:04.677
Like this.

18:05.047 --> 18:06.061
Why do you have that?

18:06.066 --> 18:07.332
Relieves my nervous energy.

18:07.747 --> 18:09.325
Are those even still a thing?

18:09.379 --> 18:10.472
Oh, wait.

18:12.821 --> 18:13.949
Ta-da!

18:13.988 --> 18:15.743
You've got to be kidding me.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.134
Well, fine, if you're
not up to the task.

18:20.259 --> 18:22.716
I understand. You probably
couldn't do it anyway. So...

18:22.912 --> 18:24.079
All right.

18:26.759 --> 18:28.578
Look, I need to focus.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.626
If you break my
concentration, it won't work.

18:31.683 --> 18:32.792
Okay.

18:41.359 --> 18:42.665
Russ, what are you doing?

18:43.021 --> 18:44.417
Looking for hidden wires.

18:44.437 --> 18:46.118
I saw this TV show about how...

18:46.464 --> 18:47.674
Magicians.

18:47.706 --> 18:49.876
- Okay. All right.
- Thank you.

19:11.963 --> 19:13.756
Look, I'm sorry.

19:13.858 --> 19:16.988
- Performance anxiety, I...
- Hey, don't give up.

19:17.335 --> 19:18.823
You got this, garvey.

19:19.831 --> 19:21.854
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.033
Try again.

19:38.817 --> 19:40.016
Whoa.

19:52.812 --> 19:54.374
Garv, you're doing it.

20:00.905 --> 20:02.216
Something like that?

20:02.977 --> 20:04.974
That's the dopest shit I've ever seen.

20:05.024 --> 20:07.323
I mean, can you teach me how to do that?

20:07.645 --> 20:09.207
Garv, that'd get me on <i>
America's got talent.</i>

20:09.251 --> 20:11.876
I mean, I don't think
there's a way. Is there? I...

20:12.133 --> 20:14.007
Whoa! I wish there was a way, I mean...

20:14.457 --> 20:15.649
Wait, Russ...

20:16.109 --> 20:17.887
Russ, there might actually be a way.

20:17.989 --> 20:19.209
- What?
- Look.

20:20.391 --> 20:21.967
We shared blood.

20:22.447 --> 20:25.453
Hastings blood is a part
of every cell in your body.

20:26.897 --> 20:28.498
Let's find out how strong.

20:32.470 --> 20:33.536
Yes.

22:07.921 --> 22:11.367
Mommy!

22:16.520 --> 22:20.128
I'm so sorry.

22:26.633 --> 22:28.317
Evan.

22:32.158 --> 22:33.595
Evan.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.729
Evan.

23:14.214 --> 23:16.547
You don't have to do this.

23:17.274 --> 23:19.414
You don't have anything to prove.

23:19.539 --> 23:22.034
You're a good man, just as you are.

23:22.691 --> 23:24.986
I wanna be like you.

23:25.921 --> 23:28.548
I have to be you.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.572
My family expects me to.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.372
They'll understand.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.076
It's gonna be okay.

23:38.940 --> 23:41.724
It's gonna be okay.

23:42.141 --> 23:45.933
It's gonna be okay.

23:46.644 --> 23:48.714
It's gonna be okay.

23:54.379 --> 23:56.612
Calvin!

23:57.238 --> 23:59.309
No!

24:00.660 --> 24:02.870
Evan! Ev!

24:03.233 --> 24:04.879
Evan! It's okay, buddy.

24:04.918 --> 24:06.649
You're all right. It's
gonna be all right.

24:06.774 --> 24:08.217
Breathe! Look at me!

24:13.094 --> 24:16.146
- ***
- hey, Evan's okay.

24:16.192 --> 24:17.953
Bullshit, he's okay.

24:18.078 --> 24:20.016
And those doctors...

24:20.141 --> 24:23.246
Severe dehydration? My ass.

24:23.303 --> 24:25.641
That thing nearly sucked
the life out of Evan.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.510
- You were there.
- That's why we gotta find

24:27.541 --> 24:30.408
who or whatever it is
bringing the negative energy.

24:30.533 --> 24:32.812
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.072
- I'm gonna get on the phone to the c...
- No, we're not doing that.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.092
We gotta get those people out of there.

24:37.129 --> 24:38.632
We gotta bring 'em to safety.

24:38.701 --> 24:41.169
If we get everyone off the base,

24:41.624 --> 24:43.008
we'll never find it.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.222
Here, we keep 'em
isolated and quarantined.

24:46.247 --> 24:47.666
That's the way this works.

24:47.864 --> 24:48.860
Wrong.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.266
- I'm tracking down colonel Donovan.
- No!

24:51.310 --> 24:52.858
You're not doing that. Hey!

24:53.091 --> 24:55.238
You called me, you asked me to help you!

24:55.282 --> 24:56.648
You wanna be a Hastings super friend?

24:56.658 --> 24:58.176
This is what it looks like.

24:58.805 --> 25:00.247
Now you let me call the plays,

25:00.274 --> 25:01.773
that is how we save lives.

25:06.324 --> 25:08.546
- All right.
- Let me deal with colonel Donovan.

25:10.636 --> 25:13.305
I would have thought
you had people for this.

25:13.933 --> 25:15.520
They are all away right now.

25:17.157 --> 25:18.824
Will we be having an organist?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.801
We have a young seeker, but

25:20.816 --> 25:22.883
to be honest, he isn't very good.

25:23.008 --> 25:24.105
If he played,

25:24.130 --> 25:27.132
Susan would crawl out of
her grave and pull the plug.

25:27.877 --> 25:29.721
She had your sense of humor.

25:32.267 --> 25:37.369
I don't really remember her past
the angry, abusive, withholding side.

25:39.416 --> 25:43.219
You don't believe people
can grow and change?

25:44.203 --> 25:47.352
I believe people show you the
side of them they want you to see.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.789
I'm not rejoining the coven.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.553
You haven't renounced your faith.

25:52.678 --> 25:54.807
My belief is in a quieter place now.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.676
But I've built a life here.

25:56.801 --> 25:59.578
My purpose is just as holy as my faith.

25:59.756 --> 26:02.272
You know, often times I'm
actually the last human touch

26:02.302 --> 26:04.043
the deceased ever have.

26:05.572 --> 26:07.391
I understand purpose.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.773
But do they love you, the Hastings?

26:11.272 --> 26:12.538
Do they know you?

26:12.711 --> 26:14.126
Truly know you?

26:14.576 --> 26:16.736
In your times of loneliness and fear,

26:16.750 --> 26:18.235
are they there for you?

26:19.545 --> 26:21.083
You speak of purpose.

26:21.602 --> 26:23.392
Mine is nearly done.

26:23.887 --> 26:26.210
I haven't got much
longer to live myself.

26:26.235 --> 26:27.293
What?

26:27.361 --> 26:30.095
When they said,
"smoking causes cancer,"

26:30.112 --> 26:31.396
I should have listened.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.032
Diana, I am so sorry.

26:34.601 --> 26:35.941
Said them all.

26:36.603 --> 26:38.780
I'm at the end of my calling.

26:38.905 --> 26:41.232
That's why I want you to take my place.

26:41.262 --> 26:42.385
What?

26:45.005 --> 26:46.824
No, I couldn't do that.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.551
I mean, I...

26:53.599 --> 26:55.656
That would be an incredible honor.

26:56.992 --> 26:59.108
Your true purpose is to lead.

26:59.395 --> 27:03.411
Your wiccan family have their
arms out stretched to love you.

27:03.668 --> 27:05.650
We need you, tilly.

27:05.987 --> 27:08.335
You turned your back on us in the past,

27:08.652 --> 27:11.136
this time, come home.

27:16.399 --> 27:18.075
You've lost your mind.

27:18.159 --> 27:20.706
That's impossible. A paranormal event?

27:20.831 --> 27:22.080
In layman's terms, yes.

27:22.101 --> 27:23.500
What kind of event?

27:27.877 --> 27:28.911
Well,

27:29.291 --> 27:31.061
it appears to be...

27:31.482 --> 27:33.875
Draining its victim's life force

27:33.910 --> 27:35.360
to increase its own power.

27:35.557 --> 27:39.240
What kind of report do you expect
me to write that includes that?

27:40.168 --> 27:42.443
My theory, this is a green on blue.

27:42.448 --> 27:45.286
- We're being infiltrated...
- This base has a supernatural presence

27:45.306 --> 27:47.205
and it is killing your people. Colonel,

27:47.517 --> 27:49.307
this is not a green on blue.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.954
My friend's nephew was nearly killed

27:50.964 --> 27:53.114
and I guarantee you, it will kill again.

27:53.302 --> 27:54.710
You don't have to believe me.

27:55.116 --> 27:56.501
I don't expect you to.

27:56.950 --> 27:58.177
But you got to trust me.

28:00.288 --> 28:01.386
Colonel.

28:05.559 --> 28:06.599
I believe you.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.140
Something like that happened to me.

28:25.212 --> 28:27.212
We had a rash of desertions.

28:29.297 --> 28:30.761
I saw something.

28:32.719 --> 28:34.182
I couldn't explain.

28:35.991 --> 28:38.691
The only word I could think of was...

28:40.936 --> 28:42.061
Evil.

28:45.594 --> 28:48.333
I never put two and
two together until now.

28:51.227 --> 28:52.591
What did it look like?

28:54.193 --> 28:55.562
That almost didn't even have a look.

28:55.575 --> 28:57.008
More of a shadow.

28:57.392 --> 28:58.653
Why didn't you say anything?

28:59.464 --> 29:01.823
I was one of three
women in the first co-Ed

29:01.853 --> 29:03.391
officer candidate school.

29:04.885 --> 29:06.284
I was living under a microscope.

29:06.298 --> 29:08.330
Saying I saw some kind of shadow monster

29:08.350 --> 29:09.715
would have been the end of me.

29:10.924 --> 29:12.924
There was one person who I thought

29:13.026 --> 29:14.304
maybe knew something too.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.860
Have you spoken with
recruit Raymond overbay?

29:16.985 --> 29:18.630
His father was at ocs with me

29:18.665 --> 29:20.355
when the disappearances happened.

29:21.201 --> 29:24.870
Everytime we spoke,
it was as if we shared

29:24.919 --> 29:27.590
a secret that neither
of us wanted to admit.

29:27.817 --> 29:30.107
What kind of recruit is overbay?

29:30.143 --> 29:33.029
He's the first one you'd
bet on to watch out.

29:33.847 --> 29:36.134
But somehow he finds some inner strength

29:36.430 --> 29:38.416
to rally at the last minute.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.252
Like father, like son.

29:41.955 --> 29:42.955
Colonel...

29:44.145 --> 29:46.351
Where would I find
Raymond overbay right now?

29:47.181 --> 29:48.942
Okay, what if Isaac walks in?

29:48.986 --> 29:51.365
He won't. He's in his study.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.799
Studying.

29:53.066 --> 29:54.598
He'll be gone for hours, okay?

29:54.723 --> 29:55.824
Just...

29:56.086 --> 29:57.535
Are you ready for this?

29:57.637 --> 29:59.759
- Well, you know me. I was...
- Don't.

29:59.992 --> 30:01.239
Don't say it.

30:02.542 --> 30:03.824
All right, what do I do then?

30:04.544 --> 30:05.970
You're gonna close your eyes

30:06.012 --> 30:08.502
and focus all your
energy on the spinner.

30:08.844 --> 30:11.039
You wanna see it moving in
your minds eye. It's like...

30:11.603 --> 30:12.818
Look, give me your hand.

30:16.122 --> 30:17.952
I'm gonna add my energy to yours, okay?

30:18.391 --> 30:20.489
Okay.

30:20.894 --> 30:22.067
You got this.

30:22.996 --> 30:25.172
Clear your mind.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.179
Don't think.

30:28.322 --> 30:29.518
Clear.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.839
Clear.

30:44.724 --> 30:46.504
You're doing it.

30:52.073 --> 30:53.658
Russ, are you okay?

30:53.971 --> 30:55.094
Russ!

30:55.727 --> 30:56.904
Russ!

30:59.599 --> 31:01.300
Russ! Look!

31:01.425 --> 31:02.777
I'm gonna get help, okay?

31:02.824 --> 31:03.902
Grandpa!

31:04.396 --> 31:06.226
Grandpa, we need you!

31:06.406 --> 31:08.194
- Russ!
- What happened?

31:08.241 --> 31:09.213
Nothing, we were...

31:09.222 --> 31:10.844
It's doesn't matter. Just do something.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.343
Is there something in the alchemy room?

31:12.353 --> 31:13.445
Not enough time.

31:16.783 --> 31:18.216
Hang in there, Russ.

31:20.938 --> 31:22.297
Stand back.

31:22.524 --> 31:24.018
It's gonna get a little messy.

31:30.362 --> 31:31.840
Oh, my god.

31:40.978 --> 31:42.407
What happened?

31:42.642 --> 31:44.840
I saved your life, Russ.

31:45.412 --> 31:46.971
If you guys don't mind me asking,

31:47.194 --> 31:48.633
why do we have blood on us?

31:48.682 --> 31:49.881
That's your blood.

31:52.154 --> 31:53.331
Cool.

32:12.759 --> 32:15.256
Okay, please, Mr.
Hastings, say something.

32:15.317 --> 32:17.111
I can't take it anymore.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.620
How do you feel?

32:22.031 --> 32:24.157
A little weak, but okay.

32:25.134 --> 32:26.499
What did you do?

32:26.624 --> 32:29.027
Bloodletting, it relieved the pressure.

32:30.059 --> 32:32.438
Practice goes back to ancient Egypt.

32:33.205 --> 32:36.164
- Were you around when ancient Egypt...
- Garvey,

32:36.912 --> 32:38.983
what do you have to say for yourself?

32:39.700 --> 32:42.117
Grandpa, it was an honest experiment.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.397
To what end?

32:43.522 --> 32:47.147
To see how close I am to
becoming as powerful as you.

32:47.850 --> 32:49.287
Good work.

32:53.081 --> 32:54.420
Garvey...

32:55.376 --> 32:57.586
You are the beneficiary...

32:58.274 --> 33:00.205
Of a sacred trust.

33:00.955 --> 33:04.597
It's been passed down through
literally centuries of Hastings.

33:05.413 --> 33:09.779
Now our gift is not to be used as...

33:09.904 --> 33:12.978
Entertainment, to make
parlor tricks, or...

33:13.025 --> 33:16.355
Bar bets, or entertaining our bffs.

33:18.194 --> 33:20.103
Look at me when I talk to you.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.046
They are consecrated tools

33:23.171 --> 33:25.526
to be used to protect the innocent

33:25.651 --> 33:27.320
from harms way.

33:27.543 --> 33:29.320
And in the wrong hands,

33:30.131 --> 33:32.642
and naive or inexperienced hands,

33:32.889 --> 33:35.098
our gifts, your gifts,

33:35.578 --> 33:37.756
can get good people killed.

33:40.285 --> 33:42.804
- Well, sir, I just like to say that...
- Russ,

33:43.476 --> 33:45.407
you're lucky to be alive, son.

33:45.461 --> 33:47.587
You need to say thank you and bounce.

33:49.279 --> 33:51.377
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

33:51.411 --> 33:53.149
Your taxi's here.

33:53.389 --> 33:56.170
Uh... I didn't order a cab.

33:59.107 --> 34:00.784
Time to say goodnight.

34:04.368 --> 34:05.892
And Russ...

34:06.307 --> 34:08.455
You're gonna get my
tunic cleaned, right?

34:09.954 --> 34:11.498
Yes, sir.

34:24.371 --> 34:25.777
What you got there?

34:25.801 --> 34:27.447
From my private stock.

34:30.166 --> 34:32.851
Seven hundred bottles ever in existence.

34:36.339 --> 34:39.340
- What's the special occasion?
- You.

34:40.368 --> 34:42.446
No matter what you decide, tilly,

34:44.161 --> 34:45.732
I'm good with it.

34:48.226 --> 34:49.810
So whatcha gonna do, lady?

34:52.244 --> 34:54.806
Um... I don't know.

34:55.860 --> 34:59.136
I figured I'd just
delay and delay until...

34:59.261 --> 35:01.717
I make a decision in the last minute.

35:04.073 --> 35:06.352
I do miss being part of the family now.

35:06.623 --> 35:09.889
I always thought of you
as part of our family.

35:11.482 --> 35:13.213
If that's so...

35:13.429 --> 35:16.674
Why don't you and bea ever
invite me out to dinner?

35:18.645 --> 35:22.101
Or watch the game with me
or ask me how my day was?

35:23.629 --> 35:25.583
It's like there's you guys

35:26.001 --> 35:29.508
and there's me, the glorified
help and it's just like...

35:31.169 --> 35:33.409
I'm just on the outside looking in.

35:33.743 --> 35:35.772
I didn't know you felt that way.

35:38.572 --> 35:41.149
I know you don't have Hastings blood...

35:42.398 --> 35:44.157
But you're not like family.

35:46.588 --> 35:49.752
Tilly, you are... family.

35:53.863 --> 35:55.336
To <i> familia.</i>

35:58.969 --> 36:00.440
To <i> familia.</i>

36:35.738 --> 36:39.249
Please, let me die so
that others can live.

36:39.688 --> 36:42.358
- This is what you wanted.
- No.

36:42.396 --> 36:45.041
You have a long career ahead

36:45.369 --> 36:47.940
and we have so much work to do.

36:56.593 --> 36:58.905
- What's up? What's going on?
- Base-wide search?

36:58.963 --> 37:00.333
Raymond overbay is missing.

37:00.351 --> 37:01.754
We have to find him, he's
the key to all of this.

37:01.798 --> 37:02.972
Copy that!

37:08.338 --> 37:09.838
Raymond!

37:10.174 --> 37:11.459
Kill me.

37:11.954 --> 37:13.926
Kill me, please.

37:16.331 --> 37:18.408
You cannot have this one.

37:19.095 --> 37:22.197
- Wanna bet?
- Raymond, move!

37:22.437 --> 37:26.020
- Veterans, yes?
- Hell yeah.

37:26.070 --> 37:27.838
Even better.

37:38.203 --> 37:39.834
What the...

37:57.573 --> 37:59.316
Oh, shit.

37:59.545 --> 38:00.823
Calvin.

38:00.824 --> 38:04.620
If you've got one of those
m67 frags in that bag,

38:04.644 --> 38:06.857
now is a good time.

38:09.157 --> 38:11.561
Save yourself, Calvin.

38:11.592 --> 38:15.246
- We need each other.
- Let's go, ***, Cal, come on.

38:15.277 --> 38:18.088
Calvin, son of ***, we are legion.

38:18.094 --> 38:20.820
*** set us free.

38:20.864 --> 38:23.033
Calvin,

38:23.065 --> 38:26.087
***

38:26.116 --> 38:28.442
Calvin!

38:28.567 --> 38:30.562
Calvin!

38:30.587 --> 38:32.411
Calvin!

38:46.390 --> 38:47.738
Travis!

38:49.814 --> 38:53.127
Oh, damn, San. Oh.

38:55.612 --> 38:58.307
You okay, kid? Huh? You all right?

38:58.344 --> 39:00.759
It's gonna be okay.

39:02.930 --> 39:04.506
<i> May I ask...</i>

39:04.537 --> 39:07.256
If Susan's only daughter, tilly,

39:07.381 --> 39:09.551
would like to say a few words?

39:12.549 --> 39:13.940
Sure.

39:21.173 --> 39:23.215
Thank you all for being here today.

39:23.340 --> 39:24.449
I'm...

39:25.185 --> 39:27.070
Not really sure what
I'm supposed to say...

39:29.017 --> 39:32.324
Susan bushay was my birth mother.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.434
She always had really nice hair.

39:37.091 --> 39:38.920
She did the best she could do

39:39.022 --> 39:40.388
with what she had,

39:42.913 --> 39:44.378
with what she knew.

39:46.925 --> 39:48.921
And I'll miss her in my own way.

39:53.503 --> 39:55.036
That's it, I'm done.

40:20.230 --> 40:21.519
Diana...

40:23.485 --> 40:26.032
I just wanted to thank
you for your offer.

40:26.402 --> 40:28.970
- And I wanted to let you know that...
- I understand.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.786
We Al have to do what we think is right.

40:32.410 --> 40:33.574
Thank you.

40:35.204 --> 40:37.712
But it's best you not attend the burial.

40:38.152 --> 40:39.920
It's family only.

41:04.207 --> 41:05.473
How's Evan doing?

41:06.270 --> 41:07.909
On the road to recovery.

41:08.198 --> 41:09.645
Yeah.

41:11.265 --> 41:13.601
He's should be released
right about the time

41:13.644 --> 41:15.579
that his class is graduatin'.

41:16.052 --> 41:17.279
Good.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.541
Thanks to your lucky charm.

41:19.801 --> 41:23.880
Yeah... that and you.

41:26.587 --> 41:28.961
You know, if you wanna thank me...

41:29.498 --> 41:31.841
Maybe now that you know
some of my family secrets,

41:31.868 --> 41:33.825
you can be our eyes
and ears around town.

41:33.868 --> 41:35.837
Let us know if you see
anything weird goin' on.

41:35.939 --> 41:38.548
Considered that done and done.

41:38.845 --> 41:42.643
So, does that make me a
new Hastings super friend?

41:44.781 --> 41:46.314
It's not like you haven't earned it.

41:46.356 --> 41:47.682
Bitchin'.

41:56.426 --> 41:57.692
She broke it off.

41:58.328 --> 41:59.930
I figured.

42:00.139 --> 42:01.326
You okay?

42:03.687 --> 42:04.880
Yeah.

42:08.255 --> 42:09.751
It's better.

42:11.030 --> 42:12.573
We gotta get going.

42:17.761 --> 42:19.325
Then let's get to gettin'.

42:22.113 --> 42:23.384
All right.

42:24.469 --> 42:26.156
Less talk and more running.

42:26.281 --> 42:28.189
I thought you were gonna say that.

42:29.073 --> 42:31.092
You know, I got injured

42:31.113 --> 42:32.605
while in that battle
with the jinn thing.

42:32.612 --> 42:33.428
Oh, yeah.

42:33.453 --> 42:35.507
Oh, you got injured, you
better run it off, soldier.

42:35.535 --> 42:36.573
Huh.

42:36.885 --> 42:39.021
You know, on the
drive over, I was thinking

42:39.401 --> 42:41.464
maybe I should take that
cottonmouth off your hands.

42:41.504 --> 42:42.645
You?

42:42.720 --> 42:43.748
Yeah, me.

42:43.763 --> 42:45.701
Why not me? It's a nice side hustle.

42:45.746 --> 42:48.515
I mean, if you can do it,
it can't be that hard, right?
