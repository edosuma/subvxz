{\an8}(Kirk)
Previously on
"Floribama Shore"...

00:05.939 --> 00:08.575
{\an8}We're going to New Orleans!

00:05.939 --> 00:08.575
{\an7}We're going to
New Orleans, bitch!

00:08.641 --> 00:11.010
{\an8}♪♪

00:11.077 --> 00:13.046
{\an8}Show me your chichis!

00:13.113 --> 00:15.148
{\an8}New Orleans is like
the city of voodoo.

00:15.215 --> 00:18.952
{\an8}Maybe somebody might put
a spell on Gus and I and
then we'll hunch.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.755
{\an8}♪♪

00:25.692 --> 00:26.826
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

00:26.893 --> 00:28.762
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up!

00:26.893 --> 00:28.762
{\an8}Keep acting an ass.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.096
{\an8}I can't wait to slap
the (bleep) out of you.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.865
{\an8}Come on, baby,
I'm right here.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.203
{\an8}(man)
Welcome to Panama City Beach!

00:37.270 --> 00:39.706
{\an8}(men)
PCB!

00:39.773 --> 00:42.709
{\an8}♪♪

00:52.952 --> 00:54.621
{\an7}(Gus)
You're the selfish one here.

00:54.687 --> 00:56.456
{\an7}Would you go out
looking (bleep) crazy?

00:56.523 --> 00:58.057
{\an8}You have an hour.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.057
{\an8}No, you wouldn't.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.859
{\an7}I can't even get dressed
in an hour!

00:59.926 --> 01:01.394
{\an7}I have mud and (bleep)
in my hair.

01:01.461 --> 01:02.529
{\an8}You're selfish, dude.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.063
{\an8}That's why I can't
(bleep) stand you.

01:04.129 --> 01:05.532
{\an7}I'm not the biggest fan
of you, either.

01:05.598 --> 01:08.168
{\an8}This is literally
my worst nightmare,

01:08.234 --> 01:10.737
{\an8}seeing my best friend
and the guy I like

01:10.804 --> 01:13.039
{\an8}going at each other's throats.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.942
{\an7}Bitch.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.942
{\an8}That's not the first
time you've said that.

01:16.009 --> 01:19.345
{\an8}I already am mad at you
because of the way
you've been doing Nilsa.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.715
{\an8}This is not a good time
for you to smart off with me.

01:22.782 --> 01:26.286
{\an7}You act like a man, right?
You cry all the time.
Weak bitch!

01:26.352 --> 01:28.121
{\an8}Yeah, because of my past,
you're damn right I do.

01:28.188 --> 01:32.025
{\an8}You cried when somebody
called you out for
being overweight.

01:32.091 --> 01:36.429
{\an7}(Nilsa)
Aimee, Aimee, stop!
Aimee, please!

01:36.496 --> 01:39.299
{\an8}Stop, please!

01:36.496 --> 01:39.299
{\an8}Bitch!

01:39.365 --> 01:42.735
{\an8}Gus threw the lowest
of the lowest of the
lowest blow at Aimee.

01:42.802 --> 01:45.171
{\an8}This is not gonna end well.

01:45.238 --> 01:48.141
{\an8}(Kortni)
Please, please, please,
please, no.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.578
{\an8}I am in shock.
I don't know what to do.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.948
{\an8}I'm just gonna try and make sure
that Aimee doesn't come back

01:55.014 --> 01:56.749
{\an8}and try to hit Gus again.

01:56.816 --> 01:59.252
{\an8}Nuh-uh, don't--
Get the (bleep)
away from me, Kortni.

01:59.319 --> 02:02.722
{\an8}What did I do?

01:59.319 --> 02:02.722
{\an8}Aimee... Kortni, just go.
Kortni, just go.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.258
{\an8}She hit me in the face
over a dinner reservation.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.493
{\an8}Like, what the (bleep)?

02:06.559 --> 02:08.728
{\an7}Uh, pretty damn special.
Isn't that bad, is it?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.964
{\an7}That pretty damn special
felt like a mosquito bite.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.299
{\an7}Come on.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.299
{\an9}(laughs)

02:13.366 --> 02:16.369
{\an8}You can't go through
life hitting people
over stupid bull(bleep).

02:16.436 --> 02:19.672
{\an8}Aimee just heard the word
"overweight" and lost her mind.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.708
{\an8}Don't even come out here
talking to me about it,

02:21.774 --> 02:22.976
{\an8}'cause I ain't got (bleep)
to say, really.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.844
{\an8}I'm going home.
You can go back inside.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.579
{\an8}(Aimee)
I am done with Gus.

02:26.646 --> 02:31.150
{\an8}Gus knows about my toxic
relationship when my ex
used to call me fat,

02:31.217 --> 02:34.220
{\an8}so I don't know why he would
throw a low blow like that.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.990
{\an8}I need to pack my bags and I
just need to get out of here.

02:39.192 --> 02:40.860
{\an8}No. I'm (bleep) going home.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.830
{\an8}I'm not spending the rest of my
summer around a weak bitch.

02:43.897 --> 02:47.534
{\an7}You keep saying that all you
want, but you are the one
freaking out right now.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.968
{\an8}Why are you still talking?

02:49.035 --> 02:50.703
{\an7}Bitch, you're the one (bleep)
talking about this (bleep).

02:50.770 --> 02:53.606
{\an8}Ain't nobody (bleep)
talking to you, bitch!

02:53.673 --> 02:55.308
{\an8}How about I press charges on you
for throwing a punch at my head?

02:55.375 --> 02:58.077
{\an7}Press charges, 'cause
that's what weak bitches do!

02:58.144 --> 02:59.913
{\an8}You better talk to her.
Don't tell me (bleep).

02:59.979 --> 03:02.682
{\an8}You're gonna work me up too.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.682
{\an8}Call the police!

03:02.749 --> 03:05.285
{\an8}Call the police!

03:02.749 --> 03:05.285
{\an8}Get control of her.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.020
{\an8}Ain't your whole family
the police?

03:07.086 --> 03:08.555
{\an8}Call your daddy, bitch.

03:14.060 --> 03:17.597
{\an7}Aimee...

03:14.060 --> 03:17.597
{\an8}Go back in there
with your friend.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.169
{\an8}True best friends chase
each other in hotels
naked if they have to.

03:23.236 --> 03:24.771
{\an7}Aimee, we can do
our own thing.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.140
{\an8}Uh, no, we can't.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.140
{\an8}Yes, we-- Yes, we can.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.108
{\an8}No, we can't.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.108
{\an8}Then we'll (bleep)
run away together.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.910
{\an7}Let me get some
clothes on, then.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.345
{\an7}We can go do
our own things.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.480
{\an7}I just want to go
and be with my mom.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.182
{\an7}You cannot go downstairs
in a towel.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.151
{\an8}Well, I'm gonna have
to 'cause we're not
gonna let you leave.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.586
{\an8}I don't want to listen
to anyone.

03:39.652 --> 03:42.555
{\an8}We're going down the elevator,
Nilsa's in a towel.

03:42.622 --> 03:45.525
{\an8}Y'all, just give me
some space.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.627
{\an8}Go upstairs.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.662
{\an8}I am, I'm leaving.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.334
{\an8}I'll be downstairs.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.370
{\an8}(Kortni)
I kind of feel like
a (bleep) person for
leaving Gus up in the room,

03:57.437 --> 04:00.707
{\an8}'cause I'm closer to Gus
than Aimee, but right now,

04:00.773 --> 04:02.742
{\an8}I'm just trying to get Aimee
not to leave.

04:02.809 --> 04:06.613
{\an7}Kortni, can you please go
upstairs and leave me alone?

04:06.679 --> 04:09.716
{\an7}No. I am leaving and I
don't want you here for me.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.521
{\an8}Aimee punched me in the face.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.089
{\an8}This happened when
I was in the shower?
She punched you?

04:17.156 --> 04:18.524
{\an8}Mm-hmm.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.524
{\an9}For what?

04:18.591 --> 04:21.594
{\an8}What was the purpose?

04:18.591 --> 04:21.594
{\an7}'Cause we're leaving
at 7:30.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.997
{\an8}Hold up, that's not right.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.498
{\an8}Kortni, what is going on?

04:25.565 --> 04:28.301
{\an7}I'm just trying to get
her to stay here

04:28.368 --> 04:29.435
{\an8}Where is she at?

04:32.972 --> 04:36.643
{\an8}What kind of (bleep) situation
have I gotten myself into?

04:36.709 --> 04:40.747
{\an8}I'm sure at some point I will
get blamed for all of this.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.116
{\an8}Yeah. I'm just like,
I'm trying to figure out,

04:43.182 --> 04:44.784
{\an8}like, what the (bleep)?
Why would she hit him?

04:44.851 --> 04:46.619
{\an8}Why are you down here
in your robe?

04:46.686 --> 04:51.124
{\an7}'Cause I gotta get my
(bleep) together real quick.

04:46.686 --> 04:51.124
{\an5}You're crazy.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.925
{\an8}I'm not trying to
(bleep) defend her.

04:52.992 --> 04:56.195
{\an7}I'm just not trying to get--
I just don't want her to leave.

04:56.262 --> 05:00.233
{\an7}She-- She can't leave me in
the middle of New Orleans.
Where is she gonna go?

05:00.299 --> 05:03.403
{\an7}I was kind of like starting to
have, like, a thing for him,

05:03.469 --> 05:05.772
{\an8}and that (bleep) just squashed
it. Like, I don't want someone

05:05.838 --> 05:06.873
{\an7}that's gonna just sit there
and keep on and keep on

05:06.939 --> 05:08.808
{\an7}and go back and forth,
back and forth.

05:08.875 --> 05:13.479
{\an7}Like, it probably would have
been better if he would have
just shut up.

05:08.875 --> 05:13.479
{\an6}Yeah.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.382
{\an8}I honestly think that
that was insensible.

05:16.449 --> 05:21.254
{\an8}At this point, I'm not taking
sides because it's not right
for Aimee to hit Gus.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.523
{\an8}Nobody in the house should be
putting their hands on nobody,

05:23.589 --> 05:26.592
{\an8}but I do believe that ladies
should stick together,

05:26.659 --> 05:30.396
{\an8}so I'm going to buy her
a drink and hopefully
she gonna calm down.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.832
{\an8}Yo, I just spent
$75 on drinks.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.832
{\an7}What?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.400
{\an8}Why'd you do that?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.400
{\an8}It's expensive up there.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.936
{\an8}Why did you do that?

05:34.467 --> 05:36.936
{\an8}Listen, don't worry
about it.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.438
{\an8}Just know that
you're not leaving.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.239
{\an8}Now, I don't know
what happened, y'all.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.241
{\an8}I was... I literally
was in the shower.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.177
{\an8}Was Kortni there
when Aimee punched me?

05:42.308 --> 05:44.177
{\an6}Yeah.

05:44.243 --> 05:47.680
{\an7}That's the perfect opportunity
for her to beat Aimee's ass.

05:47.747 --> 05:52.285
{\an8}Seriously? Like,
really? I know Aimee
was wrong, but come on.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.421
{\an8}She could have and it
would have been acceptable.
She started it.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.523
{\an8}You know, I'm extremely
disappointed in all
my roommates.

05:57.590 --> 06:02.061
{\an8}They left all this chaos and
booze and nobody stepped up
and said anything for Gus.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.629
{\an8}Nobody had Gus's back.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.466
{\an8}And now they gotta
freakin' baby Aimee.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.800
{\an8}Gus was wrong.
You weren't wrong, baby.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.303
{\an8}It's okay.
You did nothing wrong.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.038
{\an8}You know exactly
that's what they're saying.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.906
{\an8}Don't leave.

06:13.973 --> 06:17.076
{\an8}So, me and Gus got
into it and I was like,
(bleep) you, bitch.

06:17.143 --> 06:21.180
{\an8}Weak bitch. You know you--
I did say that, and he
called me overweight

06:21.247 --> 06:23.616
{\an8}and so I slapped him.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.616
{\an8}He called you overweight?

06:23.683 --> 06:25.618
{\an8}Mm-hmm.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.618
{\an8}'Cause that's not
what he said up there.

06:25.685 --> 06:28.087
{\an7}And he said, yeah,
but at least I don't cry

06:28.154 --> 06:32.492
{\an7}because I'm overweight
or some (bleep) like that.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.595
{\an8}So I hit him.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.264
{\an8}I just wonder how bad they're
roasting my ass right now,

06:38.331 --> 06:39.866
{\an8}'cause I guarantee you,
that's all that's going on.

06:39.932 --> 06:44.003
{\an8}Who (bleep) cares?
(bleep) them, dude.
(bleep) them.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.404
{\an8}With the way me
and Aimee are going,

06:45.471 --> 06:47.406
{\an8}I don't see things
getting fixed anytime soon

06:47.473 --> 06:50.309
{\an8}'cause I feel like she's
too stubborn to actually
come to me and apologize.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.246
{\an7}Is your name still
Gus Smyrnios?

06:50.376 --> 06:53.246
{\an8}Yep.

06:53.312 --> 06:57.250
{\an8}Still a bad-ass bitch
with a bad-ass hairdo?

06:53.312 --> 06:57.250
{\an5}(laughs)

06:57.316 --> 07:00.219
{\an8}I ain't gotta lecture you.
You know you shouldn't
have hit him.

07:00.286 --> 07:04.757
{\an8}I know that, but you don't
understand, when I get mad,
I, like, see red.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.794
{\an8}(Aimee)
Gus has this coming.
He's been stringing along Nilsa,

07:07.860 --> 07:09.962
{\an8}he's been inconsiderate
of my feelings.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.098
{\an8}He brings up
the overweight issues.

07:12.165 --> 07:17.503
{\an8}I don't think that there's any
way that me and Gus can be
friends again after this blowup.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.139
{\an8}(sighs)

07:20.206 --> 07:22.275
{\an8}(sighs)
What a day.

07:22.341 --> 07:26.412
{\an7}Last day, boy.
Just, psshh! Fireworks.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.048
{\an8}Wasn't this trip supposed to be
for us to come together, closer?

07:29.115 --> 07:32.084
{\an8}It's a dumb freakin' argument
anyway. It's about the time
to go eat dinner.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.987
{\an8}We're in New Orleans.
I'm trying to get some
Hand Grenades in my system.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.722
{\an8}I'm not letting this
affect my night.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.725
{\an7}It did this. Brrhh.
(laughs)

07:39.792 --> 07:42.628
{\an8}Could we please have
a good night, though?

07:39.792 --> 07:42.628
{\an5}I'm not going with him.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.064
{\an8}Let's just wait 'til the boys
leave and we'll get ready and
we'll go do a girl thing.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.532
{\an8}I want to eat, though.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.669
{\an8}Let's order room service
and then we'll go out.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.669
{\an4}Okay.

07:49.735 --> 07:50.736
{\an8}You want to do that,
Aimee?

07:50.803 --> 07:52.438
{\an9}Yep.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.438
{\an8}All right.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.074
{\an8}Honestly, it's probably
a good idea that we
stay separated

07:55.141 --> 07:56.742
{\an8}from the females
at this point.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.112
{\an8}I'm gonna have a much
better time for myself
if it's just the quo-fo.

08:00.179 --> 08:03.049
{\an7}I say we go ahead and ride.
Let's get some food,
get some drinks.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.183
{\an8}Will y'all go with that?

08:03.115 --> 08:04.183
{\an8}Let's do it.

08:06.686 --> 08:10.122
{\an8}I am definitely not letting
the girls ruin my last
night in New Orleans.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.725
{\an8}Oh, look, here we go.

08:12.792 --> 08:16.429
{\an8}Quo-fo in New Orleans.
Let's get it.

08:12.792 --> 08:16.429
{\an4}Bye, bitch.
(laughs)

08:16.495 --> 08:19.632
{\an8}(Gus)
It's a boys' night, fellas.
(bleep) the girls.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.632
{\an5}Let's get it!

08:19.699 --> 08:20.833
{\an8}(Aimee)
Coming up...

08:20.900 --> 08:23.803
{\an8}I'm going home.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.803
{\an8}No, you're not.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.372
{\an8}(Candace)
This night just keeps
getting worse and worse.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.441
{\an8}I don't know what else
could go wrong.

08:28.507 --> 08:31.577
{\an7}Kortni, I ain't got
no shoes on, so stop
walking so (bleep) fast.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.246
{\an7}I got no
(bleep)damn shoes on.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.282
{\an8}Hey, Logan's here.
(laughs)

08:36.349 --> 08:37.884
{\an8}Where does this guy
come from?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.184
{\an8}Get the (bleep)
out of here.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.184
{\an5}You ain't (bleep).

08:39.251 --> 08:40.720
{\an8}That's why you
use steroids, bitch.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.421
{\an8}Punch him or throw
my drink on him?

08:42.488 --> 08:45.825
{\an8}(overlapping shouting)

08:49.095 --> 08:53.165
{\an8}♪♪

08:53.232 --> 08:55.835
{\an8}(bleep), yeah!
No boys!

08:55.902 --> 08:57.403
{\an8}Let's get out of here.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.939
{\an8}This is so much better
than going with the boys.

09:00.006 --> 09:04.477
{\an7}It really pissed me off.
It's what Gus wants to do,
what time Gus wants to leave.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.813
{\an7}The guys make the plans
every (bleep) night,
do they not?

09:04.543 --> 09:07.813
{\an6}Yeah.

09:07.880 --> 09:12.985
{\an8}Gus has been playing
mind games with you
and I'm just over it.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.721
{\an8}(Nilsa)
I kind of do see
where she's coming from.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.790
{\an8}The fight wasn't just over
a dinner reservation.

09:17.857 --> 09:21.294
{\an8}Aimee was genuinely hurt at the
way Gus has been treating me.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.263
{\an8}That is what really set her off.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.965
{\an8}I'm done eating and
I'm about to go get ready,

09:26.032 --> 09:28.668
{\an8}so can we leave
in, like, one hour?

09:28.734 --> 09:31.871
{\an7}I've still got to take
a shower, but we can
leave in an hour.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.871
{\an5}Okay.

09:31.938 --> 09:35.241
{\an8}♪♪

09:35.308 --> 09:38.144
{\an7}I can't come to New Orleans
and get a salad. Like, I can't.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.780
{\an8}♪♪

09:40.846 --> 09:42.348
{\an8}For sure, for the food alone.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.951
{\an8}Everything looks so good.
I just want to try it all.

09:45.017 --> 09:47.887
{\an8}I feel fat-boy Gus coming out,
the full effect.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.923
{\an8}That looks amazing.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.923
{\an8}Oh, my God!

09:50.990 --> 09:54.660
{\an8}Oh, delicious!

09:50.990 --> 09:54.660
{\an8}Oh, my God!

09:54.727 --> 09:57.596
{\an8}You know what? Eff it.
I don't care about
the carbs at this point.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.966
{\an8}Booties up.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.966
{\an8}Let's make that ass clap.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.634
{\an8}We're throwing back drinks,
we're eating good food.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.302
{\an8}It's just the boys,
there's no drama,

10:03.369 --> 10:05.972
{\an8}so this is exactly what I needed
to get me out of that funk.

10:06.038 --> 10:09.308
{\an8}Damn! Even dinner's
more fun without girls.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.744
{\an8}She threw a punch at my head,
dawg, and you know me.

10:11.811 --> 10:15.414
{\an8}If she comes to me and
apologizes, I'll drop it.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.849
{\an8}I really will.
But she won't.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.987
{\an8}My pantyhose got stuck
on my shorts somehow.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.822
{\an8}Oh, I got 'em, I got 'em.

10:22.888 --> 10:26.325
{\an8}I'm not gonna lie.
I like this better
than that black top.

10:22.888 --> 10:26.325
{\an5}Yeah, I like that.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.494
{\an8}Yeah. All right,
we're leaving.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.494
{\an7}Let's go!

10:28.561 --> 10:32.832
{\an7}All I know is, I'm about
to have a bomb-ass time on
Bourbon Street with my boys,

10:32.898 --> 10:36.202
{\an7}and that's all
I'm thinking about.

10:32.898 --> 10:36.202
{\an5}Let's get it!

10:36.268 --> 10:39.538
{\an8}Let's (bleep) get it.

10:36.268 --> 10:39.538
{\an7}All right, Bourbon Street,
here we come.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.173
{\an8}You know what?

10:39.605 --> 10:41.173
{\an7}What?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.709
{\an8}I told him why I'm
self-conscious about that,

10:43.776 --> 10:45.277
{\an8}and he threw that
up in my face.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.814
{\an8}I'll never talk to him again,
honestly. I think he's (bleep).

10:48.881 --> 10:54.120
{\an8}I am done with Gus forever,
but I'm not gonna let that ruin
my last night in New Orleans.

10:54.186 --> 10:57.023
{\an8}Me and the girls are gonna
go on Bourbon Street and
we're gonna have a good time.

11:00.459 --> 11:01.494
{\an9}I agree.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.661
{\an9}Dude!

11:02.728 --> 11:03.829
{\an8}(laughter)

11:03.896 --> 11:05.498
{\an8}♪♪

11:05.564 --> 11:06.799
{\an7}All right, let's go there.
Let's try that one.

11:06.866 --> 11:10.102
{\an8}♪♪

11:10.169 --> 11:11.637
{\an8}This night's gonna be wild.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.073
{\an8}♪ I said you can call me
whenever you like ♪

11:14.140 --> 11:17.043
{\an8}♪ 'Cause you already got
my number ♪

11:17.109 --> 11:21.547
{\an8}♪♪

11:21.614 --> 11:23.215
{\an9}What's up?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.215
{\an8}What's up?

11:23.282 --> 11:25.117
{\an8}Cheers to New Orleans!

11:25.184 --> 11:27.653
{\an8}(all cheering)

11:27.720 --> 11:29.321
{\an8}We're all here
thotting and plotting.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.957
{\an8}We're in our fishnets.
We look like a bunch
of bad-asses.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.692
{\an8}It's our last night
in New Orleans!

11:33.759 --> 11:36.395
{\an8}(all cheering)

11:36.462 --> 11:37.663
{\an8}Girls' nights are so much fun.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.899
{\an8}Let's get drunk, y'all.
Let's get drunk.

11:39.965 --> 11:43.736
{\an8}(Aimee)
I just want to forget
everything that happened and
go crazy on Bourbon Street.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.338
{\an8}Our last night on Bourbon
is about to be lit.

11:46.405 --> 11:49.341
{\an8}♪♪

11:51.811 --> 11:54.480
{\an8}Oh, (bleep), the boys are here.
Wonderful.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.149
{\an8}♪♪

11:57.216 --> 11:58.284
{\an9}(bleep)!

11:58.350 --> 11:59.952
{\an8}(Gus)
Are you (bleep) joking?

12:00.019 --> 12:02.288
{\an8}Apparently this voodoo
is real in New Orleans.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.256
{\an8}Somebody had a Gus voodoo doll
they just started stabbing

12:04.323 --> 12:06.792
{\an8}'cause I feel their
presence as soon as
they walk in the room.

12:06.859 --> 12:10.362
{\an8}♪♪

12:10.429 --> 12:11.797
{\an9}(bleep)!

12:17.169 --> 12:20.806
{\an8}♪♪

12:25.478 --> 12:27.513
{\an8}(Aimee)
I'm not even gonna
acknowledge the boys.

12:27.580 --> 12:33.052
{\an8}I'm just gonna stay as far
as I can away from them and just
keep the good times rolling.

12:33.119 --> 12:36.222
{\an8}♪♪

12:48.367 --> 12:50.503
{\an8}Well, the girls
completely kill our mood.

12:50.569 --> 12:54.006
{\an8}I didn't come to New Orleans
to deal with the same (bleep)
I dealt with in Panama City.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.141
{\an8}I don't have time for it.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.921
{\an8}Codi does have a track record of
playing both sides of the fence,

13:08.988 --> 13:10.923
{\an8}but still, I thought
Codi was my boy.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.625
{\an8}Now my boy isn't even
having my back.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.268
{\an8}I know the girls
are now out with us.

13:22.334 --> 13:25.838
{\an8}I'm trying to mend
tension. I'm trying to
keep this house together.

13:25.905 --> 13:29.742
{\an8}And Gus can try to calm
down if he wants to, but
I'm trying to fix it.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.442
{\an8}(Kirk)
Gus needs to calm down.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.078
{\an8}We're just trying to
have fun and just the
whole vibe's killed.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.986
{\an8}Oh, I just don't want to
have to deal with drama again.

14:19.325 --> 14:22.161
{\an8}Are you (bleep) joking?
'Cause I thought Kortni
had my back.

14:22.228 --> 14:25.331
{\an8}I thought Kortni had
my side in this situation,
but apparently not.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.233
{\an8}That hurts worse than
Aimee's hit to my face.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.670
{\an8}(Kortni)
I'm literally bracing myself
because I know that Gus

14:31.737 --> 14:34.740
{\an8}is going to lecture
the (bleep) out of my ass.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.943
{\an8}She's one of the most
disrespectful people I've
ever met in my life.

14:38.010 --> 14:43.015
{\an8}And if she thinks I'm gonna go
to her bitch ass and apologize
after that, she's (bleep) high.

14:43.082 --> 14:46.118
{\an7}I'm done being
a nice guy to them.

14:43.082 --> 14:46.118
{\an5}Then don't be.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.187
{\an7}Because when I'm the nice guy to
them, you know what they say?

14:48.254 --> 14:51.857
{\an7}You're sensitive ass bitch.
So you know what? (bleep) it.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.462
{\an8}Gus is just ranting and
screaming and yelling,

14:56.528 --> 14:59.198
{\an8}not at me, but just, like,
to the world.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.366
{\an8}(bleep) her!

15:00.432 --> 15:02.334
{\an8}Dude, I'm not trying
to pick sides,

15:02.401 --> 15:05.070
{\an8}so, brother,
I'm just gonna let you vent.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.672
{\an7}I'm the (bleep) done.
I'm (bleep)...

15:06.739 --> 15:08.474
{\an7}I'm done with
this house in general.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.844
{\an7}Everybody wants to come at me,
and I'm tired of it.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.813
{\an8}♪♪

15:28.594 --> 15:31.630
{\an8}That's not remotely
what happened.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.370
{\an9}Aimee.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.806
{\an7}And he said, yeah,
but at least I don't cry

15:40.873 --> 15:43.609
{\an7}because I'm overweight
or some (bleep) like that.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.687
{\an7}No, I did not!
I said, you want to call me

15:54.753 --> 15:57.056
{\an7}sensitive for calling me out
because of my past,

15:57.122 --> 16:00.826
{\an7}but yet you cry because
someone calls you out
because of your weight.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.795
{\an7}Which one's more
(bleep) sensitive?

16:29.588 --> 16:31.690
{\an8}Even though I'm closer
to Gus than Aimee,

16:31.757 --> 16:35.260
{\an8}I don't necessarily feel like
Aimee's completely in the wrong.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.231
{\an8}The things that Gus said
weren't necessarily right,

16:39.298 --> 16:42.401
{\an8}but I know that it's wrong
of Aimee to have laid
her hands on Gus.

16:54.046 --> 16:55.881
{\an7}Kortni!

16:55.948 --> 16:58.951
{\an8}No, he never said that.
What he said...

16:55.948 --> 16:58.951
{\an4}Kortni...

17:11.696 --> 17:13.298
{\an7}You didn't say that
earlier, though.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.101
{\an7}You said he said I was crying
'cause I was overweight.

17:16.167 --> 17:18.604
{\an8}That's not what happened.
That is not what happened.

17:18.670 --> 17:21.406
{\an8}What happened is...
Hold on, hold on.

17:21.473 --> 17:26.678
{\an8}Apparently I'm a liar.
Codi cuts in and tries
to talk over me, and I'm done.

17:26.744 --> 17:30.482
{\an8}What happened was...

17:26.744 --> 17:30.482
{\an7}She lied,
she lied.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.551
{\an8}I know, and you're
believing her.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.520
{\an8}Hey!

17:32.618 --> 17:34.520
{\an9}Kortni!

17:34.586 --> 17:37.589
{\an8}You cannot...

17:34.586 --> 17:37.589
{\an7}Oh, whoa!

17:37.656 --> 17:41.560
{\an8}I'm done with the whole
situation. I'm done being there
for both sides of the party.

17:41.627 --> 17:45.130
{\an8}I'm walking my ass back to
the (bleep) hotel, 'cause right
now, I don't give a (bleep).

17:45.197 --> 17:48.467
{\an8}Kortni, don't walk in the
street, bitch. Get on the
sidewalk.

17:48.534 --> 17:53.038
{\an8}This night just keep getting
worse and worse. I don't know
what else could go wrong.

17:53.105 --> 17:58.410
{\an8}Kortni! Kortni, I ain't
got no shoes on, so stop
walking so (bleep) fast!

17:58.477 --> 17:59.945
{\an7}I ain't got no
(bleep)damn shoes on!

18:05.250 --> 18:07.152
{\an8}♪♪

18:07.219 --> 18:12.357
{\an8}Kortni! Kortni, I ain't
got no shoes on, so stop
walking so (bleep) fast!

18:12.424 --> 18:14.726
{\an7}I ain't got no
(bleep)damn shoes on!

18:14.793 --> 18:17.329
{\an8}Kortni, stop! Kortni!

18:14.793 --> 18:17.329
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

18:17.396 --> 18:19.298
{\an8}(Candace)
Yo, this is crazy.
We in New Orleans.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.066
{\an8}We supposed to be having
a good time.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.136
{\an8}I don't think it's written
in the stars for us to
not have drama.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.939
{\an8}Listen to me. Nobody was
trying to attack you.

18:27.005 --> 18:30.776
{\an7}Why would I make (bleep) up?
I'm not a liar!

18:30.843 --> 18:34.179
{\an7}The one thing I am not
is a (bleep) liar!

18:34.246 --> 18:37.082
{\an8}I'm pissed off because
when someone calls me a liar,

18:37.149 --> 18:40.118
{\an8}it's like a punch in the face
because I'm the most honest
person there is.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.821
{\an8}Even if you don't want to hear
it, I will tell you.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.389
{\an8}Can you please have
a good time while we can?

18:44.456 --> 18:48.327
{\an8}I'll watch y'all.

18:44.456 --> 18:48.327
{\an9}Come on.

18:48.393 --> 18:52.798
{\an8}The way that Gus has been
treating you, it really
pisses me off.

18:52.865 --> 18:57.035
{\an8}(Aimee)
You know what? Nilsa started
developing feelings for Gus

18:57.102 --> 19:00.305
{\an8}and he acts like
he doesn't even know her.
I'm sick of him.

19:00.372 --> 19:03.141
{\an7}I don't want my best friend
being treated like that.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.878
{\an8}Aimee is right. I don't
want to put myself out there

19:05.944 --> 19:09.214
{\an8}for someone who hurts me
and doesn't even know
that he's hurting me.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.784
{\an7}It don't (bleep)
matter where we go,
it's always (bleep).

19:12.851 --> 19:14.419
{\an8}I got one thing.
You know, Kortni,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.822
{\an8}do you think I was
100% in the wrong?

19:16.889 --> 19:18.690
{\an8}I was not mad at you.

19:18.757 --> 19:22.661
{\an8}But not 100%. I know
I'm wrong, but I'm not
100% in the wrong.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.497
{\an7}I'm not gonna say that...
I wasn't there, Aimee,

19:25.564 --> 19:27.699
{\an7}but I'm not gonna say
that you're 100%...

19:27.766 --> 19:33.238
{\an8}He said, you get mad
'cause people pick on
you for your weight.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.207
{\an7}This is what I feel.
Like, it's a...

19:35.274 --> 19:37.676
{\an7}I said, it's a
complication of words.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.178
{\an8}It really pissed me off.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.681
{\an8}(Candace)
Aimee basically wants me
to agree with her,

19:42.748 --> 19:46.084
{\an8}but at the end of the day,
Aimee has no right to put
her hands on nobody.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.587
{\an7}I just want to go in the club
and have a good time.

19:48.654 --> 19:51.490
{\an8}Let's go to another bar.
Come on. Let's bar hop.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.158
{\an8}♪♪

19:53.225 --> 19:56.962
{\an8}Oh, yeah, baby, send it!

19:53.225 --> 19:56.962
{\an8}(whistle blowing)

19:57.029 --> 19:58.196
{\an8}What's your name?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.196
{\an7}Caroline.
Nice to meet you.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.598
{\an8}Caroline, Gus.
Nice to meet you.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.033
{\an8}What's your name?

19:59.665 --> 20:01.033
{\an7}Callie.

20:01.099 --> 20:02.868
{\an8}Callie? Gus.
Nice to meet you.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.370
{\an8}Did you guys just come
to New Orleans for the
week to party or what?

20:05.437 --> 20:07.239
{\an8}What's the deal?

20:07.306 --> 20:08.874
{\an8}What y'all studying?

20:07.306 --> 20:08.874
{\an8}Criminal justice.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.443
{\an7}I'm studying criminal justice.
There you go. Yeah.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.745
{\an8}Little Caroline is a fine
little thing, let me tell you.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.547
{\an8}She's from Seattle,
but she's got the same vibes

20:15.614 --> 20:17.649
{\an8}that I get from a Southern girl,
and I'm digging it.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.284
{\an8}Y'all come roam with us.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.219
{\an7}You can come with us.
I'd love for you
to come with us.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.121
{\an7}We have a good time,
always.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.691
{\an8}You know, I was upset,
but I'm not gonna
let it ruin my night.

20:25.757 --> 20:28.393
{\an8}There's a pretty girl
in front of me. We'll
see what happens.

20:28.460 --> 20:32.464
{\an8}♪♪

20:32.531 --> 20:34.499
{\an8}We're having so much fun.
We're riding the bull,

20:34.566 --> 20:37.302
{\an8}we're dancing, we're drinking,
we're taking shots.

20:37.369 --> 20:38.370
{\an8}We're having a great time.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.238
{\an8}Whoo!

20:38.437 --> 20:40.238
{\an8}♪♪

20:40.305 --> 20:42.374
{\an8}♪♪

20:40.305 --> 20:42.374
{\an8}Yay!

20:45.010 --> 20:48.747
{\an8}This place is pretty cool.

20:50.949 --> 20:53.018
{\an8}But that's just because, like, I
know what I look for in a person

20:53.085 --> 20:55.654
{\an8}and I haven't found it,
you know what I mean?

20:59.157 --> 21:02.160
{\an8}Damn, I'm not gonna lie.
I did not see that coming.

21:04.162 --> 21:08.266
{\an8}Gus and I are making out
with these girls on a balcony
outlooking Bourbon Street.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.903
{\an8}Yeah, this is how
I saw my night going.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.839
{\an8}Let's get a pizza.

21:20.979 --> 21:24.516
{\an8}My bad, dawg. My bad. Classic
mix-up, man, classic mix-up.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.485
{\an8}Have a good night.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.485
{\an9}You too.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.087
{\an8}I'll talk to you soon.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.087
{\an8}All right, here we go.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.690
{\an8}(Gus)
I mean, part of me does
want Caroline to go back
to the hotel room,

21:31.757 --> 21:34.426
{\an8}have some fun for
the night, but I know
the girls are too pissed.

21:34.493 --> 21:37.996
{\an8}I don't know if she can handle
a punch the same way I can.

21:38.063 --> 21:41.867
{\an8}Do I have to leave New Orleans?
Please, can I just stay forever?

21:43.168 --> 21:44.569
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Coming up...

21:44.636 --> 21:46.872
{\an8}Get the (bleep)
out of here, bitch!

21:46.938 --> 21:48.840
{\an8}Hey, put your hands on him,
you put your hands on me!

21:48.907 --> 21:51.043
{\an8}My jaw's right here.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.043
{\an8}Put your hands on him
again, bitch!

21:54.346 --> 21:55.847
{\an8}♪♪

21:55.914 --> 21:57.349
{\an8}New Orleans, baby.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.584
{\an7}There's a box of freaking
Nilsa's food all from breakfast,

21:59.651 --> 22:01.119
{\an7}so we can have it in here
right now.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.388
{\an7}I'd smoke
that omelet right now.

22:03.455 --> 22:07.826
{\an8}Uhh! We're back.

22:03.455 --> 22:07.826
{\an8}(gasps and laughs)

22:07.893 --> 22:11.163
{\an8}(Gus)
It looks like the girls ordered
some food and I am pumped.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.632
{\an8}Eat all of it right now.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.632
{\an8}Oh, I will.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.534
{\an8}What is that?

22:13.699 --> 22:15.534
{\an8}I want a bite
of something.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.869
{\an7}I've already gained eight
pounds. Might as well
gain eight more.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.072
{\an8}Okay, I guess
I'll have one slice.

22:20.138 --> 22:21.406
{\an8}You know what would
be good on this?

22:21.473 --> 22:23.108
{\an8}That French Quarter
hot sauce.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.108
{\an7}(belches)

22:23.175 --> 22:25.544
{\an8}Okay, two slices
can't hurt me, right?

22:25.610 --> 22:27.546
{\an8}(Codi)
What is that on that...
on your pizza?

22:27.612 --> 22:31.583
{\an8}Whatever I found
on the counter.

22:27.612 --> 22:31.583
{\an5}This pizza is really good.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.951
{\an8}All right, good night.
Love you guys.

22:33.018 --> 22:37.456
{\an8}♪♪

22:37.522 --> 22:39.458
{\an8}I gotta chug this
before we get in the car.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.626
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Even after this roller coaster
of a trip,

22:41.693 --> 22:44.463
{\an8}we had a great time,
and cheers to New Orleans.

22:48.767 --> 22:52.270
{\an8}(Aimee)
All the guys are asleep,
and I'm glad, because I
can't deal with that.

22:52.337 --> 22:54.306
{\an8}I'm drunk and I'm going to bed.

22:54.372 --> 22:58.677

is not enough, right?

I'm waking up this morning.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.590
{\an8}Last night didn't necessarily
go how I wanted it to.

23:45.657 --> 23:48.927
{\an8}Me and my roommates got
into it. Aimee actually
laid her hands on me.

23:48.994 --> 23:50.295
{\an8}And this isn't what this trip
was for, man.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.530
{\an8}We were supposed
to come together.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.498
{\an8}We were supposed to bring
only good vibes.

23:53.565 --> 23:56.701
{\an8}And ultimately, it got
more ugly here than it had
been ever in Panama City.

I can't even look at Gus.

24:07.979 --> 24:12.484

I'm just very embarrassed
about what I did.

{\an9}Morning.

New Orleans.

everybody else is.

'til, like, what? 4:00?

{\an7}I have the nastiest taste
in my mouth.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.703

just regret.

Aimee, wait for me.

over me too.

My favorite part of this
whole trip was the food,

25:11.543 --> 25:15.547
{\an7}'cause y'all know how I am
with food. (laughs)

Do you want to address
the Gus thing?

25:21.119 --> 25:23.288

25:23.355 --> 25:25.290
{\an8}Not yet.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.759
{\an8}I'm gonna sit down and talk to
him not in front of everyone.

25:27.826 --> 25:29.794
{\an9}Yeah.

25:27.826 --> 25:29.794
{\an8}That should stay
between y'all.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.898
{\an8}Yeah, because when we get
everybody involved, it
just gets worse and worse.

25:32.964 --> 25:36.134
{\an8}That's exactly right,
but, like I told you
last night, Aimee,

25:36.201 --> 25:38.503
{\an8}the first words need
to be "I'm sorry."

25:38.570 --> 25:41.172

out the right way to do it.

25:41.239 --> 25:43.642

I will apologize.

Something smells horrible.

cheese and mixing it around

days, mixed with his puke

{\an8}that happened
before I got here.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.716
{\an7}(Gator)
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

28:04.783 --> 28:09.421
{\an8}And she told her that,
um, you...

28:09.487 --> 28:11.556
{\an8}that she stopped you from
putting your hands on me.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.229
{\an8}But you did grab me.

28:18.296 --> 28:21.800
{\an8}You can't say you didn't
do that, 'cause you did.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.868
{\an8}And she thought that you
was going to hit me.

28:23.935 --> 28:26.371
{\an8}That's why she told
my mama that.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.674
{\an8}I don't really think
Jada did anything wrong.

28:29.741 --> 28:32.410
{\an8}Jada has never liked Gator,
so Jada was telling my mama

28:32.477 --> 28:35.647
{\an8}the reasons why she didn't
like Gator, and those were
one of the reasons.

28:35.713 --> 28:38.883
{\an8}And so she mentioned
something that I never
mentioned to my mama.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.287
{\an8}I know you not
worried about it.

28:42.353 --> 28:43.988
{\an8}You ain't never
worried about it.

28:46.691 --> 28:48.993
{\an8}I don't think my mama
want to talk to you.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.862
{\an8}(Gator laughs)

28:50.929 --> 28:55.233
{\an8}My mama has not been
a fan of Gator since the
beginning of Gator's existence.

28:55.300 --> 28:59.571
{\an7}I don't think she's gonna be
open to having... hearing
anything you have to say.

28:59.637 --> 29:02.907
{\an8}Now, honestly, Gator
has no chance of getting
my parents' approval.

29:02.974 --> 29:05.009
{\an8}It's gonna be problems,
'cause any time

29:05.076 --> 29:07.645
{\an8}I mention your name,
she gonna have an issue.

29:10.381 --> 29:11.449
{\an8}(dial tone)

29:11.516 --> 29:14.452
{\an8}♪♪

29:18.389 --> 29:21.392
{\an8}♪♪

29:23.428 --> 29:24.963
{\an7}What are you
celebrating, Nilsa?

29:25.029 --> 29:28.133
{\an8}I don't know. How to get
drunk (bleep) by myself.

29:28.199 --> 29:31.436
{\an8}(Aimee)
Since I've been home
from New Orleans,

29:31.503 --> 29:34.706
{\an8}I've been very embarrassed
about what I did to Gus.

29:34.772 --> 29:38.843
{\an8}It's just been weighing
on my conscience and I hate
that I acted like that.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.712
{\an8}I just don't know
how to apologize.

29:40.778 --> 29:43.448
{\an8}(line ringing)

29:43.515 --> 29:44.549
{\an7}(Teresa)
<i>Hello?</i>

29:44.616 --> 29:46.050
{\an9}Hey, Mommy.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.488
{\an8}I'm back home
from New Orleans.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.790
{\an8}Yeah, I did something
kind of bad, though.

29:52.857 --> 29:55.226
{\an8}Uh, I hit Gus.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.128
{\an7}(Teresa)
<i>You hit Gus?</i>

29:57.195 --> 29:58.830
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.732
{\an7}(Teresa)
<i>What'd you hit Gus for?</i>

30:00.798 --> 30:04.002
{\an7}'Cause he said something
to me about being overweight.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.544
{\an8}No, not yet.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.480
{\an8}I don't think so,
but I feel bad

30:15.547 --> 30:17.649
{\an8}because I shouldn't have
put my hands on him.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.658
{\an8}I know I didn't.
I know I was in the wrong.

30:26.724 --> 30:28.993
{\an8}I need to apologize,
but I don't know how.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.963
{\an7}I feel so bad, I don't
even know how to apologize.

30:32.030 --> 30:36.668
{\an8}I'm scared that Gus is not
even gonna want to talk to me
and I really can't blame him.

30:36.734 --> 30:39.571
{\an8}He's probably gonna say,
"(bleep) you, bitch.
You hit me."

30:42.240 --> 30:45.443
{\an8}(laughs)
Mama!

30:51.216 --> 30:52.951
{\an8}Okay. I love you.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.152
{\an7}(Teresa)
<i>All right. Love you.</i>

30:54.219 --> 30:55.620
{\an8}All right,
love you, Mommy. Bye.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.156
{\an9}(groans)

30:58.223 --> 31:00.191
{\an8}Not too shabby.

{\an9}(belches)

31:00.258 --> 31:01.526
{\an7}(Codi)
I haven't done that
(bleep) since college.
I did it one time

31:01.593 --> 31:02.827
{\an7}I was here, and I was like...
(imitates choking)

31:02.894 --> 31:04.162
{\an8}Yeah, but it's still, like,
it's like one

31:04.229 --> 31:06.497
{\an8}of those things, like,
you know the technique.

31:06.564 --> 31:07.665
{\an8}(Codi)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:07.732 --> 31:10.235
{\an8}♪♪

31:10.301 --> 31:11.736
{\an7}(Aimee)
Hey, Gus, you want to talk?

31:11.803 --> 31:14.706
{\an8}We can if you want.

31:11.803 --> 31:14.706
{\an7}I want to.

31:14.772 --> 31:17.308
{\an8}♪♪

31:17.375 --> 31:22.880
{\an7}I have been so (bleep)
embarrassed on the way
that I acted

31:22.947 --> 31:24.816
{\an7}and how I put
my hands on you.

31:24.882 --> 31:30.221
{\an7}I am a crazy bitch
and, you know, and I...

31:30.288 --> 31:32.557
{\an8}Gus, I feel so bad.

31:32.624 --> 31:35.660
{\an7}I couldn't, like, even figure
out the words to say to you

31:35.727 --> 31:38.963
{\an7}to apologize for, like,
putting my hands on you
and all that.

31:39.030 --> 31:43.067
{\an7}I don't have an excuse
on the way I acted
except I'm a crazy bitch,

31:43.134 --> 31:44.936
{\an7}but, you know,
Nilsa's feelings was hurt.

31:45.003 --> 31:48.406
{\an7}This stays between me and
you, but she started, like,
getting feelings for you,

31:48.473 --> 31:52.043
{\an7}so things were just adding up
and I was just really aggravated

31:52.110 --> 31:56.014
{\an8}and I am so, so sorry.

31:52.110 --> 31:56.014
{\an8}It's all good.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.216
{\an8}(Gus)
This is what I was trying to
avoid in this whole house.

31:58.283 --> 32:00.785
{\an8}It was supposed to
just be between me
and Nilsa just having fun,

32:00.852 --> 32:03.855
{\an8}and now I'm getting hit
in the face because of it.

32:03.921 --> 32:08.593
{\an7}And I don't expect you to
forgive me, but I hope you
know that I am so sorry

32:08.660 --> 32:11.829
{\an8}and I am so embarrassed
on the way that I acted.

32:11.896 --> 32:15.033
{\an8}I'm an emotional person,
yes, but I know you're
an emotional person too,

32:15.099 --> 32:17.435
{\an7}so when you get worked up,
you say things you don't mean.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.337
{\an8}You act out of emotion.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.539
{\an8}I love Gus
like a little brother.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.343
{\an8}Actually, I kind of,
like, envy Gus a little bit
for being so sensitive.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.712
{\an8}I got my heart broken,
it made me hard.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.580
{\an8}It's all good.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.580
{\an8}I love you, Gus.

32:29.647 --> 32:30.948
{\an8}I do too, girl.

32:29.647 --> 32:30.948
{\an8}I really do love you

32:31.015 --> 32:33.084
{\an8}and I'm real sorry.

32:31.015 --> 32:33.084
{\an8}It's all right.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.653
{\an8}We'll move on. I ain't
gonna hold nothing
against you, I promise.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.789
{\an8}I love you, Gus.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.789
{\an8}Love you too.

32:37.855 --> 32:40.358
{\an8}I mean, I don't want to drag
this any longer than what it's
already been dragged out,

32:40.425 --> 32:42.794
{\an8}and I feel like this apology
is genuine, so I'll squash it.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.896
{\an8}We'll move on.
It is what it is.

32:44.962 --> 32:47.732
{\an8}I hate to apologize,
but that's how sorry I am.

32:44.962 --> 32:47.732
{\an4}I know how you are.
You're prideful.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.201
{\an7}Thank you for
actually apologizing.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.201
{\an5}I love you, Gus,

32:50.268 --> 32:53.571
{\an8}and thank you for being
such a good guy.

32:53.638 --> 32:58.876
{\an8}I feel so much better
that Gus accepted my apology.

32:58.943 --> 33:02.213
{\an8}Honestly, he's a great guy
and a very strong person

33:02.280 --> 33:05.350
{\an8}because if that would
have been someone that
put their hands on me,

33:05.416 --> 33:07.285
{\an8}I probably wouldn't have
forgave them.

33:07.352 --> 33:10.788
{\an8}I apologized to Gus.

33:07.352 --> 33:10.788
{\an7}You did?

33:10.855 --> 33:14.559
{\an8}How'd that go?

33:10.855 --> 33:14.559
{\an8}I told him that
I have no excuse

33:14.625 --> 33:18.029
{\an8}on why I acted the way
that I did and that
I was wrong

33:18.096 --> 33:20.398
{\an8}and that the reason
why I haven't apologized

33:20.465 --> 33:24.702
{\an8}is 'cause I've just been
so damn embarrassed that
I acted that way.

33:24.769 --> 33:27.705
{\an7}(Kirk)
Did he take it well?

33:24.769 --> 33:27.705
{\an9}Yeah.

33:27.772 --> 33:30.808
{\an8}I still feel bad
about it, though.

33:27.772 --> 33:30.808
{\an7}Yeah.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.643
{\an8}(Nilsa)
That's how you know
that you're sorry,

33:32.710 --> 33:37.281
{\an8}when it's been days and you
still feel bad about it.

33:32.710 --> 33:37.281
{\an6}Yeah.

{\an7}I'm about to get ready
right now.

33:47.392 --> 33:49.160
{\an8}We're probably gonna
leave here about 7:15.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.795
{\an8}It's like 6:00.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.795
{\an9}Oh, okay.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.098
{\an8}(Nilsa)
A lot happened in New Orleans,
but we can never forget

33:54.165 --> 33:58.136
{\an8}Candace told us that Gator has
put his hands around her neck.

33:58.202 --> 34:02.407
{\an7}He was upset
and he grabbed my neck.

33:58.202 --> 34:02.407
{\an5}There's no excuse for that.

34:02.473 --> 34:04.709
{\an8}I want to be able to get her
mind off of all the craziness

34:04.776 --> 34:07.779
{\an8}that's been going on with her
and Gator, so I want to go to
dinner with my girl.

34:07.845 --> 34:10.380

We're just gonna pregame,
get some drinks here,
and then go (bleep) rage.

34:28.433 --> 34:31.668
{\an8}Dating is hard nowadays,
isn't it?

34:28.433 --> 34:31.668
{\an5}It's so hard.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.337
{\an8}Dating is real hard.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.337
{\an8}So (bleep) hard.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.871
{\an8}Oh, Nilsa, I have
something to tell you too,

34:34.938 --> 34:36.007
{\an8}and you might
get mad at me, but...

34:36.072 --> 34:37.775
{\an7}Tell me.

34:36.072 --> 34:37.775
{\an9}...sorry.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.409
{\an8}When I was talking
to Gus today

34:39.476 --> 34:42.313
{\an8}that I was sorry and that
I was a crazy bitch,

34:42.380 --> 34:44.982
{\an8}I told him that one of
the reasons that I got mad

34:45.049 --> 34:47.752
{\an8}is because he's been kinda
acting like you don't exist

34:47.819 --> 34:50.321
{\an7}and you were starting to
get kinda feelings for him.

34:50.388 --> 34:52.590
{\an7}(laughs)

34:52.657 --> 34:55.193
{\an8}Oh, (bleep)!

34:55.259 --> 34:57.462
{\an7}Aimee, what did he
say back?

34:57.528 --> 35:00.998
{\an8}He didn't say anything.
He was like, really?

35:01.065 --> 35:03.801
{\an8}And I was like, yeah,
so maybe he was kind of
happy about that?

35:03.868 --> 35:06.671
{\an8}After all that Gus and I have
been through this summer,

35:06.737 --> 35:10.007
{\an8}I still have no clue
what's going on. It's
so confusing to me.

35:10.074 --> 35:11.776
{\an8}Friends have the same
taste in alcohol

35:11.843 --> 35:14.612
{\an8}but not the same taste
in men.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.612
{\an5}So, cheers to that.

35:17.181 --> 35:21.486
{\an8}I was going to ask you
about the whole thing
with Gator.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.654
{\an8}So, do you think you're
gonna break up with him?

35:23.721 --> 35:27.258
{\an8}After I talked to Gator today,
like, his reaction towards it,

35:27.325 --> 35:31.863
{\an8}like how he didn't even care,
uh, I really don't like that.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.332
{\an8}I don't really know what to
think about our relationship.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.334
{\an8}My head's going in so many
different directions.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.070
{\an8}I don't know if I feel
for building this relationship.

35:39.136 --> 35:41.172
{\an8}I don't know how you're supposed
to feel in a relationship

35:41.239 --> 35:44.642
{\an8}'cause I don't do relationships,
so I don't know, I don't
really know.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.711
{\an7}I'm tired of arguing
with him, so...

35:46.777 --> 35:49.780
{\an8}Do you think it's because
Gator is the first person

35:49.847 --> 35:53.518
{\an8}that has said he wants
to settle down with you
and move you to Atlanta

35:53.584 --> 35:55.486
{\an8}and have kids with you
and marry you and all
that stuff?

35:55.553 --> 35:58.623
{\an7}Who else is gonna want
to marry me and put me
in a house and...

35:58.689 --> 36:01.125
{\an8}So many people.
So many people.

36:01.192 --> 36:04.896
{\an7}You being so beautiful
is intimidating to a guy.

36:04.962 --> 36:06.631
{\an8}Well, grow some
(bleep)damn balls, then.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.699
{\an8}If you see what you want,
come try to get it.

36:08.766 --> 36:12.236
{\an8}Make some effort.
That's what I'm saying.
At least Gator made effort.

36:12.303 --> 36:18.142
{\an8}There is no doubt in my mind
that Candace can do 100 times
better than Gator.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.544
{\an8}And you have a good head
on your shoulders.

36:19.610 --> 36:22.446
{\an8}I think you are gonna find
a good Christian man.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.382
{\an7}You know, it ain't even
about him being Christian.

36:24.448 --> 36:26.884
{\an7}It's just about me finding
somebody that treat me right

36:26.951 --> 36:29.120
{\an7}and somebody that supports
everything I'm doing.

36:29.186 --> 36:30.488
{\an8}He don't do that.

36:29.186 --> 36:30.488
{\an7}No.

36:30.555 --> 36:34.358
{\an8}He wants you
to have babies.

36:30.555 --> 36:34.358
{\an7}Right.

36:34.425 --> 36:37.295
{\an8}And I feel like you should
respect your mom and dad's
decision,

36:37.361 --> 36:39.530
{\an8}because if I had a daddy
that would have been like,

36:39.597 --> 36:42.500
{\an8}"that boy ain't right
for you," you know,
I probably would listen.

36:42.567 --> 36:45.803
{\an7}Yeah, my pops
ain't feeling Gator.

36:45.870 --> 36:51.208
{\an8}It's been a rough couple
of days obsessing over
this stuff with Gator,

36:51.275 --> 36:54.812
{\an8}but I do have my roommates
who understand where
I'm coming from,

36:54.879 --> 36:56.647
{\an8}so, you know,
that feels good.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.516
{\an8}All right, guys,
y'all ready?

36:58.583 --> 37:00.818
{\an8}Let's go find the boys!

36:58.583 --> 37:00.818
{\an8}Let's go find the boys.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.922
{\an7}Kortni, when we get to the taxi,
will you dig out my wedgie?

37:04.989 --> 37:08.793
{\an8}I'm digging it right now.

37:04.989 --> 37:08.793
{\an7}Get out of her ass(bleep),
Kortni!

37:08.859 --> 37:10.795
{\an8}I was just checking.

37:10.861 --> 37:12.263
{\an8}♪♪

37:16.500 --> 37:18.235

37:18.302 --> 37:21.038
{\an8}First night back at PCB,

37:27.144 --> 37:29.513
{\an8}Listen to me when I say this,
get you a Long Island.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.149
{\an8}No Name's cool. Like,
it doesn't give off that,
like, crazy party vibe.

37:32.216 --> 37:34.485
{\an8}It's like a lounge.
You chill. The porch is big.

37:34.552 --> 37:36.387
{\an8}You know, get strong drinks.
We're just vibing.

37:36.454 --> 37:40.091
{\an8}Dude, Bourbon Street
was insane.

37:36.454 --> 37:40.091
{\an4}Oh, yeah,

37:40.157 --> 37:42.460
{\an8}(Codi)
Oh, (bleep)damn it,

stupid mother(bleep).

37:52.136 --> 37:53.304
{\an9}Yeah.

{\an8}Where does this guy come from?

38:02.346 --> 38:04.148
{\an8}(Kirk)
You never know what's gonna
come out of Logan's mouth.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.752
{\an8}He shows up. "Hey, work for me."
I'm just like, okay, man.
Like, shut up.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.537
{\an8}When are we gonna
get rid of this kid?

38:26.604 --> 38:29.507
{\an8}I wanted to say, uh,
plan on her not
calling you, dawg.

38:29.573 --> 38:31.142
{\an8}(laughter)

38:31.208 --> 38:33.177
{\an8}(Gus)
You know Kortni's, like,

38:35.246 --> 38:37.114
{\an8}(Kortni)
Go, go, go, go, go.
Hit it, hit it, hit it.

38:37.181 --> 38:38.649
{\an7}(Nilsa)
Kortni's trying to get
in the damn bar.

38:38.716 --> 38:41.018
{\an8}Are we ready to party?

38:41.085 --> 38:44.188
{\an8}We party and we'll
drop our "A," hey!

38:41.085 --> 38:44.188
{\an6}(laughs)

38:44.255 --> 38:48.592
{\an8}I just want tonight to be a
drama-free night and just go
balls to the wall.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.735
{\an7}Let's go, bitch!
Bitch, where it at?

38:59.603 --> 39:01.972

{\an8}He's a (bleep) idiot.

39:26.330 --> 39:27.732
{\an8}Oh, here we go.

39:31.001 --> 39:36.507
{\an8}Logan came up to us not once,
not twice, but three times.
I've had enough.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.609
{\an8}I'm tired of him
freakin' running his suck.

39:38.676 --> 39:41.112
