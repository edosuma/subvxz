00:08.008 --> 00:09.801
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:09.884 --> 00:11.428
-You did this, Em.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.847
I said I love it, and I love you.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.765
Sorry, I'm just a little overwhelmed.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.559
Is it possible that
the amount of "whelm"

00:17.642 --> 00:20.520
that you're feeling is due in part
to the magazine thing?

00:20.603 --> 00:23.398
You think you could call it "the magazine"
and not "the magazine thing"?

00:23.481 --> 00:26.568
Have you guys talked
about some version of childcare?

00:26.651 --> 00:29.404
We're more talking about
talking about it.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.406
Men suck.
That's my thesis.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.199
Mm-hmm, okay.
Jot this one down;

00:33.283 --> 00:35.035
uh, we're confused.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.287
<i>The Vexing Plight</i>
<i>of the Millennial Male.</i>

00:37.370 --> 00:38.496
It is our two-month anniversary.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.957
The things I'm gonna to do
to you when we get home.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.127
Oh, what a shame.
I don't sleep with married women.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.587
<i>Uh, this is a bit awkward,</i>

00:45.670 --> 00:47.839
but you postponed
the last two scheduled signings,

00:47.922 --> 00:50.383
and I just wanna make sure
that we're still on for Monday.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.052
Cool.
Cool, cool, coolio.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.096
You seriously need to stop
worrying about the Trakarskys

00:55.180 --> 00:56.639
and start sorting your own shit.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.641
<i>You saw your dad</i>
-Hey, peanut.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.435
Go the fuck away.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.396
I texted Emma that Jack and I
would be out of the loft all day

01:03.480 --> 01:05.440
so she could deal with the shit
we've been storing.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.692
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.664
Izzy said you wouldn't be here.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.625
Oh, you talked to Izzy?

01:23.708 --> 01:25.502
Yeah, she texted me,
said you'd both be gone

01:25.585 --> 01:28.296
so I could deal with all
my shit you've been storing.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.508
See, she, uh... she left a key.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.720
Okay, could you guys
give us some, uh...

01:36.721 --> 01:38.723
When did they leave?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.442
-Well, I have a question.
-Oh, good,

01:49.526 --> 01:52.779
'cause another 10 seconds
of this excruciating silence,

01:52.862 --> 01:54.781
and I was gonna fake
an aneurysm.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.287
Ah. Um, did Izzy not
know you'd be here?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.331
Of course she knew
I'd be here. I...

02:05.208 --> 02:08.336
-Oh.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.464
-Apparently.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.592
I think she wants us to scream

02:14.676 --> 02:16.219
and throw things at each other,

02:16.302 --> 02:19.139
-like I need that to move on.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.516
'Cause you can lob something
right at my head.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.767
No.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.686
I'm good.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.147
We're good. Me and Izzy.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.278
Um, I actually have
a pretty packed schedule.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.030
I got a lot of errands to run,
just so you know.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.574
On a Saturday?

02:37.657 --> 02:40.368
After watching basketball
and drinking beer?

02:40.451 --> 02:43.997
-Well, that's new.
-Mm, it's all new, Em.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.541
Everything.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.584
Hm.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.587
So you really are good, the two of you?
You're happy?

02:53.381 --> 02:55.967
I love her more than
I ever thought possible.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.220
Aww.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.014
That's awesome.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.892
That really makes me happy.

03:13.985 --> 03:14.819
Argh!

03:14.903 --> 03:17.071
What am I supposed to do?
You won't answer my calls.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.740
Uh, maybe stop calling?

03:18.823 --> 03:21.242
-Aw, come on, peanut.
-I told you not to call me that.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.453
-Let's not--

03:23.536 --> 03:24.537
Your mom.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.122
-Yeah.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.624
Mom told you where I live?

03:27.707 --> 03:30.585
Yeah, she did.
She thinks we should talk.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.422
Isabelle.

03:34.839 --> 03:38.468
Did I invite you to my side
of the street? No, I didn't. Go away!

03:38.551 --> 03:39.886
Well, I'm not gonna...

03:40.887 --> 03:41.846
I'm sober.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.350
Can't say the same. Just downed
a couple medicinal Bloodies to even out.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.144
You know what I'm saying?
Never mind. I know you do.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.106
No. I don't mean right now.
I mean I'm sober.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.613
Really?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.031
Yep.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.450
How long?

04:02.533 --> 04:03.868
Little over a year.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.078
Wow.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.372
Only 26 years too late.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.338
-Uh, yeah, I used this app.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.507
Left at precisely
the optimal time

04:17.590 --> 04:20.969
to minimize both departure
and arrival, so...

04:21.052 --> 04:22.095
Wow.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.681
I know. Amazing.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.267
What's it called?

04:29.018 --> 04:32.397
Um, I don't know off the top of my head,
but I could get my phone.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.524
Actually, I couldn't care less.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.901
Just couldn't think of
anything else to say.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.404
So, how's everything else going with you?

04:39.487 --> 04:42.615
I mean, aside from being more in love
than you ever thought possible.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.244
Well, it'd be easier for me
to make a list of the parts of my body

04:46.327 --> 04:48.538
that don't ache from all
the dancing I've been doing.

04:48.621 --> 04:52.125
Like, my hair and...

04:52.917 --> 04:54.294
that's about it actually.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.712
You... You dance now?

04:55.795 --> 04:58.089
Oh, yeah. Publicly.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.133
And we're on
the highly unrecommended

05:00.216 --> 05:02.677
vodka, pot,
and delivery food diet.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.390
But I get to wake up
every morning, look at her,

05:07.473 --> 05:10.685
and fall in love all over again,
so there's that.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.937
Huh. Mm-hmm.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.859
So, how's, uh, things
with what's

05:17.942 --> 05:19.235
Smiley?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.361
Wiley?

05:20.445 --> 05:22.196
-Kylie.
-Kylie.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.366
She is awesome.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.534
Mm.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.161
Smiley, really?

05:28.244 --> 05:29.912
-That's a name.
Totally gonna name
my first-born daughter

05:31.748 --> 05:33.041
Smiley Jane Trakarksy.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.252
Yeah, assuming you want her to grow up
to be a deformed comic-book villain.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.969
So, the lesbian thing
is working out for you?

05:45.053 --> 05:48.473
Um, it is... it is...
it is going very well.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.849
Thank you for asking.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.731
Can we take a second just to acknowledge
how weird this conversation is?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.984
-I mean, did you ever imagine that--
-No, Em.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.570
This is not what I imagined.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.363
At all.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.282
Yeah.

06:06.365 --> 06:09.035
Can you just give me five minutes
without storming off?

06:09.786 --> 06:11.996
Okay, four?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.793
I'm getting my shit together, Isabelle.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.505
I'm here for a pretty major
construction project.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.299
I'm managing a bigger crew
than I ever have before.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.343
It's Izzy.
Don't call me Isabelle.

06:25.426 --> 06:28.805
Right, Izzy. I'm not bragging.
I'm just saying I've changed.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.432
Here's a thought: what if
you gave up the bottle too late

06:31.516 --> 06:33.518
and you just suddenly die
right in front of me

06:33.601 --> 06:35.728
and that's why you're here -
karmic justice?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.522
-I'm imagining you dropping dead.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.731
Why are you laughing?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.525
Because you're funny
when you try to be mean.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.026
Oh, my God.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.155
-It's mid-Swedish modernalism.
-Mm, nope.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.450
"Mid-Swedish" isn't a thing,
and "modernalism" isn't a word.

06:49.534 --> 06:53.329
Mm, my original Jorgen Eriksson,

06:53.412 --> 06:57.625
the first furniture acquisition
I could honestly refer to as a piece.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.795
It was way more than we could afford.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.756
Yeah, we had to sleep on a mattress
on the floor for six months

07:03.840 --> 07:04.757
so you could buy that.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.968
No, we slept on a mattress for six months

07:07.051 --> 07:09.971
because you couldn't figure out
how to build the IKEA bed frame.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.306
As I recall, neither could the architect.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.643
Pretty sure the Swedes
are fucking with us.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.857
I haven't looked through this stuff.
Are you sure this is all yours?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.625
Okay, so, I stuck
my widget in your launch pad.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.254
Whoa! You stuck your what in my what?
Buy a girl a drink first.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.257
I... you... the...

07:46.340 --> 07:48.676
-The, uh...
-Oh, that's great. You broke Alex.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.429
Well, you gotta flex the muscles, babe.
Use 'em or lose 'em.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.640
It's, uh, cloud-based,
and, uh, mm...

07:54.724 --> 07:55.892
Whew!

07:55.975 --> 07:57.602
And now he's reverted to puberty.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.021
So we can all access the files,

08:00.104 --> 08:02.106
and we can see the layout in progress,

08:02.190 --> 08:05.109
-give notes on the page like... This.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.404
Oh, God, Alex, you're amazing.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.492
Th-Thank you so much.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.994
Oh, uh, hey, Carmen,

08:15.077 --> 08:16.704
when did... when did you get here?

08:16.787 --> 08:18.289
-Unbelievable.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.665
Hey, Carm?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.375
Hey.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.169
Hey. Hey, Hannah.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.506
Oh, you got a little, uh... adolescent
male on your shirt there.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.092
Oh, Alex works for the printing company.
He's 24.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.011
-Great.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.514
And you're doing earmuffs on him
like he's some sort of child.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.849
That's great. Do you guys have
an HR department yet, or...?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.726
-Mm-mmh.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.937
Okay, so, what's wrong?
What's going on?

08:41.020 --> 08:44.023
Things kinda went south...
pretty fast over there.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.527
Like, Deep South. Like Alabama.
Things went Alabama over there.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.153
I left the house 40 minutes ago.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.655
I know. It was all very sudden.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.823
I'm gonna go ahead and blame
the uprising on hunger,

08:52.907 --> 08:54.951
because we are literally
out of everything.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.869
Hey. Why don't you and I
take a break?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.162
Give these two some space.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.956
For sure. Absolutely.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.376
-Bye.
-Bye... Alex.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.878
He only intermittently knows I exist,

09:05.962 --> 09:08.089
but he melts into a puddle
every time Hannah speaks.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.800
Can we get back to
the Amari famine of 2018 please?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.885
Right. Right, okay,
well, listen close,

09:12.969 --> 09:15.846
because this is incredibly
useful information.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.975
There are these large,
regulated establishments

09:19.058 --> 09:21.102
filled with every type of food
you can possibly imagine,

09:21.185 --> 09:22.687
and if you can't find something,

09:22.770 --> 09:25.314
kindly Samaritans
with name tags will guide you.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.859
That's very clever. Now,
if I go to this magical place,

09:28.943 --> 09:30.820
-Absolutely not!

09:30.903 --> 09:32.405
Okay, so then,
how does that work?

09:35.658 --> 09:37.577
Oh, you're doing the thing
where you...

09:37.952 --> 09:40.246
...wanna say something,
but your mouth is sealed shut,

09:40.329 --> 09:42.582
and your eyebrows are dancing.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.127
I mean, you've taken the kids
to the store countless times, right?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.628
Somehow we all keep
coming back alive!

09:47.712 --> 09:49.922
You think I like coming over here
like some hapless Neanderthal?

09:50.006 --> 09:53.593
I am very disappointed with myself
right now! This is hard.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.431
Well, that's a start.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.766
Yeah?

10:02.018 --> 10:05.229
Well, what's going on?
Are you coming home soon

10:05.313 --> 10:07.982
I will come home
when I'm done-ish, just like you.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.692
Okay.

10:11.902 --> 10:12.987
Mm.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.407
Go to the store with your children.
Women will swoon.

10:16.490 --> 10:19.368
-Intriguing.
-Trust me. Super-fucking hot.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.954
All right, go. Off you go.
Back to work, people!

10:25.541 --> 10:27.376
Are you gonna do
your ceremonial breath cleaning

10:27.460 --> 10:29.629
of a single glass,
or is now a bad time?

10:29.712 --> 10:32.840
Okay, so the experiment's definitely
gonna need what we call controls.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.425
Yeah, I'm familiar with the concept.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.969
That means we need to keep
a lot of things the same

10:37.053 --> 10:40.139
so that we can accurately measure
the differences between my test subjects.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.391
Yeah.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.393
Did you just womansplain me?

10:45.645 --> 10:46.520
Is that too soon?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.938
Way too fuckin' soon.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.566
I'm thinking
I should meet all of my dates

10:50.650 --> 10:52.777
the same way and go to
the same place with them.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.780
I was thinking a dating app
and right here,

10:55.863 --> 10:57.406
not too late, not too early.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.908
Those are the controls.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.871
No, no. Date on, Garth.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.084
Date like nobody's watching, huh?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.877
Date... date till the cows come home.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.337
Date like...

11:11.420 --> 11:13.631
Did you hit your head
on that same shelf again?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.510
Boom! First date's
gonna be tomorrow night.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.178
Okay, well, someone's
a little sure of themselves.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.805
So, one cleavage shot,

11:20.888 --> 11:23.265
and all the men of Portland
are instantly reduced

11:23.349 --> 11:26.102
to horny, right
Come on.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.854
Well, that's just...

11:33.526 --> 11:35.152
Well, cou--

11:35.236 --> 11:37.238
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

11:37.321 --> 11:40.783
I-I can't hear you over the teeming horde
of lustful suitors.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.785
-Okay...

11:42.868 --> 11:44.120
The point is...

11:45.704 --> 11:47.456
-How about you...

11:48.707 --> 11:49.750
Never mind.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.712
Oh, my God,
this guy's dressed like a wizard.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.631
Shaun, look.

11:56.006 --> 11:56.841
Shaun?

11:58.551 --> 11:59.885
Shaun?

12:00.302 --> 12:01.720
Hmm. Maybe.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.558
I don't know about you,
but I could eat.

12:07.643 --> 12:11.021
Um... yeah, I don't think...
We don't have anything here, but...

12:11.105 --> 12:13.065
-It's fine.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.943
I'm sorry. That was a bad idea.
It's not a party. Let's just, um...

12:17.778 --> 12:21.949
Oh, my God. Why do we have
23 perfectly good sets of ear buds?

12:22.658 --> 12:25.995
And 19 half-burned holiday candles.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.164
You'd think just once
we would look for leftovers.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.876
Can I please light all the pumpkin spice
candles for Izzy

12:31.959 --> 12:33.419
-It's kinda...

12:34.336 --> 12:36.088
Wh

12:36.172 --> 12:37.298
Huff?

12:37.381 --> 12:38.966
I mean, what the fuck is that?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.968
-Yeah.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.473
Izzy set this up.
It's what she wanted.

12:45.556 --> 12:50.394
You think this is what she wanted,
for us to continue not talking about it?

12:50.478 --> 12:54.732
Trade quips about ear buds
and fucking holiday candles?

12:54.815 --> 12:57.443
-I was just... trying to--

12:57.526 --> 13:00.613
We can just have the movers
take the rest of this stuff.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.781
You should go.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.623
Okay.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.756
Make your amends
and go away already.

13:18.839 --> 13:22.218
Okay, well, I-I called you
when I got my one-month chip

13:22.301 --> 13:24.386
and then my three-month chip
and then my one-year--

13:24.470 --> 13:26.680
I heard the messages.
I just assumed you were lying.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.849
Uh, n-no.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.976
Not to rub it in or anything.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.603
It's kinda hard
to work construction

13:32.686 --> 13:34.939
if you can't handle the concept
of other people drinking.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.483
Cool, 'cause those Bloodies
are starting to wear off,

13:37.566 --> 13:41.278
and this surprise visit of yours
is accelerating my headache.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.155
Guess it's 4:00 somewhere.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.366
Are you suggesting that
I'm an alcoholic like you?

13:45.449 --> 13:46.659
No.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.119
You can't just drop back
into my adult life and parent me.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.121
Okay, fine.
Fine. Understood.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.457
I just want a chance to be...

13:53.541 --> 13:55.251
I don't know.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.379
Whatever you'll let me be, I guess.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.092
Well, here's a tip:
Don't do the annoying 12-step thing

14:03.175 --> 14:06.136
where everybody has to get into
the same rickety, joyless boat as you.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.223
-You're right.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.267
I said you're right. I won't.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.686
Good!

14:19.358 --> 14:20.651
<i>You know what?</i>

14:20.734 --> 14:22.278
No.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.780
"No" what?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.574
I'm not leaving.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.825
Oh, and this?

14:28.951 --> 14:30.494
This is mine.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.705
What is that?

14:32.788 --> 14:35.541
That is the kind of mix a guy makes
when he's trying to prove

14:35.624 --> 14:38.419
that he's too cool to listen to music
anyone else has ever heard of.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.004
Okay, 'cause I originally got that

14:40.087 --> 14:43.048
from a philosophy grad assistant
who I dated for like five minutes.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.760
So, you remixed me,
and you never came clean about it?

14:48.220 --> 14:49.430
Yeah.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.307
That was <i>my</i> big secret.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.102
Right.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.316
I'm sorry, Jack.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.111
I really am sorry.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.543
You know that was the only baby gift
we got before the miscarriage?

15:29.219 --> 15:30.763
First time I...

15:31.221 --> 15:33.933
I thought the universe was
trying to tell me something.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.565
Izzy's right.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.692
We need to talk.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.158
Yeah.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.375
Could you clear something up for me?
I mean, it's no big deal,

15:59.458 --> 16:01.335
just the vexing mystery
of my entire existence.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.296
Yeah, piece of cake. Shoot.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.633
If you and Mom hated each other so much,
why did you get married?

16:08.175 --> 16:10.177
We didn't start out
hating each other.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.931
Things got dark after I lost my job.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.184
That's your excuse?

16:17.267 --> 16:20.187
It had nothing to do with
the excessive drinking or the affairs?

16:21.021 --> 16:24.024
I'm an alcoholic,
and I was a shitty father.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.902
And while I'm laying it
all out there,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.737
your mother and I were
never really in love,

16:28.821 --> 16:30.531
-so when things got a little rough...
-That's nice.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.116
...we took it out on each other.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.285
I only stayed for you.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.291
Well, I guess you got over me.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.544
Was it the braces

16:43.627 --> 16:45.212
Something I said?

16:47.339 --> 16:51.427
When I left, I-I told myself
that it was the best thing for you.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.223
But now, I realize that I was just doing
what drunks do when things get hard.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.434
I ran away.

17:00.185 --> 17:04.231
And I know they're just words,
but I need to say them.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.443
I'm sorry.

17:09.278 --> 17:13.449
And you will never
know how much, Izzy.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.164
There's one more stop.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.840
Hey. Hi, hi. Hello.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.092
Um, this, what you're doing...

17:32.176 --> 17:33.677
It's against FDA rules, okay?

17:33.761 --> 17:37.389
Something about saliva
and the fact that it's fucking annoying.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.224
Yeah, so if you guys
don't stop immediately,

17:39.308 --> 17:41.477
I'm gonna have to punch you
both in the face,

17:41.560 --> 17:44.480
and I don't wanna.
Sorry. It's the law, so...

17:45.064 --> 17:46.607
Sorry. Shaun, what do you want?

17:46.690 --> 17:49.193
I'm not in the mood to be
berated about how little I work.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.986
Okay, for the record,
you basically get paid

17:51.070 --> 17:53.363
to hang around at a bar
that you already hung around at.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.909
Which, saying it out loud, makes me
think that it's a pretty cool idea.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.745
Hey, and you and your bestie
have violence issues!

17:59.828 --> 18:01.705
Deal with it. Get a Groupon.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.253
What's wrong?

18:11.590 --> 18:14.843
Fucker keeps posting these weird pictures
of him and his dad

18:14.927 --> 18:17.221
somewhere in the woods,
smiling all over themselves.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.640
Why the hell are they
in the woods all the time?!

18:19.723 --> 18:23.310
Right, I-I'm thinking it's not so much
the woods as it is the...

18:23.936 --> 18:28.190
...excessive smiling. Am I right?
I mean, how dare he be so happy?

18:28.273 --> 18:31.777
Ow! You gotta stop doing that!
You got these bony, little knuckles.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.113
-Pussy.
-Psycho.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.533
Okay.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.954
My best, most logical guess is that...

18:42.579 --> 18:46.250
clearly a zombie outbreak has happened
somewhere near Salem, Oregon,

18:46.333 --> 18:48.585
and they've taken
to the woods to survive.

18:48.669 --> 18:53.132
And it's all shits and giggles
for, you know, dad and son here,

18:53.215 --> 18:55.759
and they're just shitting and...
and giggling

18:55.843 --> 18:59.972
and building lean-tos until
someone's face gets eaten off, which...

19:00.973 --> 19:04.977
clearly hasn't happened yet,
and that's why they're there, so...

19:05.435 --> 19:08.730
Mystery solved. Occam's razor.
You're welcome. Next.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.775
You are so fuckin' weird.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.368
-It's cute.
-Mm.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.499
If you'd asked me a year ago
where would we be right now,

19:27.583 --> 19:29.751
I would've said:
on your favourite rug

19:29.835 --> 19:32.045
in our perfect
Hawthorne Heights home,

19:32.796 --> 19:34.381
staring at our baby,

19:34.464 --> 19:38.802
interpreting every burp or shit
as a sure sign of future greatness.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.304
Yeah. We would've been that couple

19:41.889 --> 19:44.016
posting a hundred
indistinguishable baby photos

19:44.099 --> 19:47.311
on Instagram when really one
would be just boring enough.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.941
When did you stop wanting kids?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.111
There wasn't one moment.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.573
It just kinda happened
gradually over the years.

19:59.656 --> 20:02.659
Ever consider talking
to me about it?

20:04.745 --> 20:05.746
I did.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.081
You just never heard me.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.836
So that's how you sleep at night.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.255
-I've wondered.
-And how do you sleep at night

20:15.339 --> 20:18.383
ever since Izzy's high-functioning uterus
became the centre of your world?

20:18.467 --> 20:21.678
Please tell me I did not
just fucking hear that.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.015
Hold on a sec.
I don't get a side to this story?

20:25.098 --> 20:27.142
No. You absolutely,
100% do not.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.311
Jack, admit it:
it was just a matter of time

20:29.394 --> 20:33.190
before you and Izzy thought of me as
the barren first wife who forgot to leave.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.984
No, you do not get to be
the wounded one.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.444
You fucking imposter.

20:37.527 --> 20:40.113
Imposter? Imposter -
this from the guy

20:40.197 --> 20:42.491
who hands out mixes of songs
he's never heard of.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.785
You hired an escort
to get your groove back,

20:44.868 --> 20:46.662
and then you got down
on your fucking knees

20:46.745 --> 20:48.038
and begged her
to have your baby

20:48.121 --> 20:49.790
right in front of
your goddamn fucking wife.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.336
Bravo.
Author, author.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.381
Oh, my God, at least see an actual play
before you toss around the jargon.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.590
What about our marriage?
Huh?

20:58.674 --> 21:01.885
I had a fucking front-row seat
to that bullshit piece of theatre.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.554
Kudos on the surprise ending, by the way.

21:04.638 --> 21:08.684
Corporate jet and a six
That's fuckin' nice.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.105
Jesus, Emma, how could you
do that to me?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.318
I can't do this with you
right now.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.903
If you won't leave, I will.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.614
Jack.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.699
Jack!

21:23.782 --> 21:26.118
Just tell me what to do,
what to say, how to fix it.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.161
-I want to fix this.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.955
You want to be fucking friends?

21:30.038 --> 21:32.374
You want to double date,
go to each other's weddings?

21:32.457 --> 21:33.625
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:33.709 --> 21:36.128
You are a delusional psychopath
who only builds things

21:36.211 --> 21:37.754
to compensate for everything
she destroys.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.631
Fuck you and your diagnosis of me.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.718
Fuck me?
You owe me 12 fucking years.

21:43.677 --> 21:44.553
Fuck you!

21:45.554 --> 21:46.888
-Fuck you!

21:46.972 --> 21:48.390
Fuck!

21:48.473 --> 21:49.599
Ow!

21:50.684 --> 21:52.728
-I'm sorry.
-Jesus.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.604
-Here, let me take a look.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.318
Are you...

21:59.401 --> 22:00.902
Yeah, no,
that was like some real

22:00.986 --> 22:02.654
<i>War of the Roses</i> type shit, except...

22:02.738 --> 22:05.157
-It was... it was soft.
-Softer. Yeah.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.952
Sorry.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.675
So, you're having people over?

22:23.759 --> 22:25.802
Nope. I'm consuming
an extra-large pizza,

22:25.886 --> 22:29.222
a case of beer, and 29 bucks
worth of candy all by myself.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.767
-I call it "Saturday".
-Ah.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.688
So, what now
A shake

22:36.772 --> 22:38.565
Uh, I'm good, but thanks.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.776
Ah. Thank you.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.488
Well, it's been a... been a slice, Ben.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.781
S-Sorry.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.159
You sure you don't need
a hand with that?

22:49.242 --> 22:51.787
No, I got it.
It's not my first rodeo.

22:53.371 --> 22:54.331
-Isabelle--
-Please.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.249
Don't say something
stupid and ruin it.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.336
Don't ruin it?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.505
So, you mean you thought
this went well?

23:01.588 --> 23:03.215
See? Like... like that.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.008
Okay.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.308
I gave you one for school,
remember?

23:13.391 --> 23:14.684
Yeah.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.104
I guess it worked.
You didn't get kicked out like I did.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.315
Actually, I did.
Junior year.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.401
I didn't know that.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.612
There's a lot you don't know.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.406
Yeah.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.577
When do you have classes?

23:32.661 --> 23:36.164
I'm getting my PhD.
I don't really have classes.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.290
Right.

23:38.583 --> 23:43.380
But, uh... Monday I have
a 10 with my advisor.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.631
Why?

23:49.928 --> 23:51.012
Why?
