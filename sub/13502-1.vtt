The merger
has already been approved

00:57.190 --> 00:58.680
by the shareholders.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.920
All we need is for the regulators
to sign off on it

01:00.960 --> 01:03.861
and we can proceed
with the closing as scheduled.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.956
That's why it's important
that we have all the paperwork filed

01:05.999 --> 01:08.399
by the end of next week.

01:08.435 --> 01:11.029
Oh, we are gonna
make this happen.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.699
I can feel it.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.571
I mean think about it--

01:15.608 --> 01:20.477
a combined $18.4 billion
in assets.

01:20.513 --> 01:22.413
Oh, I know, I know,
but don't worry about that.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.848
I am gonna take care of it.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.952
You know I don't like to lose.

01:27.987 --> 01:29.511
Okay, bye.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.046
Fran?

01:33.193 --> 01:34.683
Yes? Yes, Miss Connors?
Hi.

01:34.727 --> 01:36.752
I'm gonna need those
branch analysis reports

01:36.796 --> 01:39.128
that we talked about if we're gonna
have this wrapped up by the 18th.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.996
Okay, you got it.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.093
Um, Miss Connors,

01:43.136 --> 01:46.196
I was wondering
if it might be possible

01:46.239 --> 01:49.697
to get out a little early
on Valentine's Day.

01:49.742 --> 01:52.006
Oh. Who's the lucky guy?

01:52.045 --> 01:55.173
Joe Mars.

01:55.215 --> 01:58.707
Joe Mars? From accounting?

01:58.751 --> 02:01.811
He got reservations at Le Bernardin.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.323
- Wow!
- Please?

02:04.357 --> 02:07.349
- Oh, s-- yes yes, of course.
- Thank you, Miss Connors.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.758
And-- and I'll get you
these reports right away.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.821
Okay, thank you.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.993
- Hi.
- Hi, Fran.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.831
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I just heard that.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.065
Joe Mars asked her out
for Valentine's Day.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.198
Uh, yeah, I know.
But the question isn't

02:21.241 --> 02:24.005
what does he see in her,
but what doesn't he see in us?

02:24.043 --> 02:26.739
Well, maybe Joe isn't
into successful women.

02:26.779 --> 02:29.179
Okay, you are too much of a romantic.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.740
Oh, says the girl dating the guy
in the mailroom.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.342
What can I say? I like 'em young.

02:35.922 --> 02:39.722
- What about you?
- Uh, what about me?

02:39.759 --> 02:43.354
Ha, I have a nine-year-old at home
and a 60-hour-a-week job.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.830
Yeah, you're right. No fun for you.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.799
I mean, or you could just
put it all aside

02:47.834 --> 02:49.392
for one day, couldn't you?

02:49.435 --> 02:51.369
Come on, it's Valentine's Day.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.372
I mean even you deserve a little fun.

02:53.406 --> 02:57.001
Oh, thanks.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.806
- What is it?
- Ugh.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.814
- Bad news?
- Babysitter canceled.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.907
- Again?
- Yeah, I--

03:03.950 --> 03:06.111
you know, I've gotta go pick up Kelsey.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.779
I accept your apology.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.516
Of course, it's forgotten. Thank you.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.220
Connors!

03:14.260 --> 03:16.125
Leaving a little early, aren't we?

03:16.162 --> 03:18.255
Yeah, I-- I know,
but the babysitter canceled.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.391
- I've gotta go pick up my daughter.
- You're not going anywhere.

03:20.433 --> 03:23.368
We have a conference call
with the board today at 5:00.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.768
I know, but I--

03:24.804 --> 03:26.999
And they're going to expect
an update on the merger.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.031
This whole baby is yours, Connors.

03:29.075 --> 03:32.010
I know and I am going to have
Fran reschedule, I promise.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.640
- It's just this one time I've got--
- You said that a month ago.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.617
Oh, that was the science fair.
It was very important to her.

03:38.651 --> 03:41.313
- And the month before that.
- The school play.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.754
I-- I'm a single mother.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.783
Connors, I was under the impression
that this job was important to you.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.658
Oh, it-- it is.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.824
That you were willing to do
whatever it takes to close this deal.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.526
- I am.
- Because when that phone rings

03:54.567 --> 03:55.966
in the middle of the night,
I need to know

03:56.002 --> 03:57.492
that you're there to take that call.

03:57.537 --> 03:58.902
You know I will.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.270
All work, no play, 24-7.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.138
That is my motto.

04:03.176 --> 04:06.009
And you know,
when this merger passes,

04:06.045 --> 04:09.481
I'm gonna need someone
I can trust to run operations.

04:09.515 --> 04:12.382
Are you offering me a promotion?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.283
Well, of course,
if you're too busy

04:14.320 --> 04:16.151
with this whole
"Ozzie and Harriet" thing,

04:16.189 --> 04:19.954
I assume I can give it
to Anderson or Martinez.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.221
Oh, no.
No no no.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.855
That will not be necessary.
I mean I can do it.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.227
I will do it.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.256
The FDlC is already reviewing
the paperwork

04:27.300 --> 04:29.734
and I am confident that this deal
will go through next week.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.498
That's just what I wanna hear.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.473
And, Connors, don't worry
about that babysitter.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.671
You're gonna make so much money
you're gonna be able to afford a nanny.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.373
Kelsey will... love that.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.977
Kelsey, sweetheart.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.380
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.778
- I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
- You're late.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.412
I know.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.946
And I promise it won't
happen again, okay?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.959
You always say that.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.292
But this time I really mean it.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.264
I'm just gonna put that away, okay?

05:40.306 --> 05:42.433
Come on, I'm gonna make you
something yummy for dinner.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.500
Let's go.

05:44.544 --> 05:48.537
Okay, I promise I will never
forget you again.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.476
Honey, I'm just gonna
go down and grab the mail.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.508
I'll be right back.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.920
Zeus, Trooper was just telling me

05:56.956 --> 05:59.516
how he saved 10 people
from an avalanche!

05:59.559 --> 06:01.527
Isn't he brave?

06:01.561 --> 06:03.859
Yeah yeah,
he's a regular superdog.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.124
What's going on here?

06:05.164 --> 06:09.624
- What's it look like?
- Okay, it's time for bed, sweetie.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.159
- Mom?
- Yeah?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.172
That letter-- was it from Dad?

06:14.307 --> 06:16.741
Um, I'm not sure

06:16.776 --> 06:18.767
because I haven't read it yet.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.573
Is he coming to visit?

06:21.614 --> 06:23.844
He didn't come last year for Christmas.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.478
Well, um, honey, I'm not sure.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.819
Then can we go
and visit him and Grandpa?

06:30.857 --> 06:33.121
We never go back there.

06:33.159 --> 06:36.253
Oh, I know, sweetie.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.092
Well, how about this?

06:38.131 --> 06:42.192
I promise that as soon
as Mommy is done

06:42.235 --> 06:46.194
with this silly work thing
that I've gotta do,

06:46.239 --> 06:49.333
we will make a plan, okay?

06:49.375 --> 06:51.468
Okay.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.240
Give me a kiss.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.508
Okay, go brush your teeth

06:56.549 --> 06:58.312
and I'll be in in a minute
to tuck you in, okay?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.216
Okay. Love you. Night.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.720
All right.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.038
A subpoena?

07:20.072 --> 07:22.597
What--

07:22.642 --> 07:24.872
"You, Laura Connors Hackett,

07:24.911 --> 07:28.711
are hereby commanded
in the name of the state of Texas

07:28.748 --> 07:30.682
to appear before
the Probate and Family Court

07:30.716 --> 07:33.207
at Centerville, Texas, courthouse

07:33.252 --> 07:35.447
on the 10th day of February."

07:39.659 --> 07:43.151
Okay, so brass tacks, Sam--
what did you find out?

07:43.196 --> 07:44.686
It's a subpoena, Laura.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.756
You and Kelsey both
have to attend in person.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.429
But, God, can't you just tell
the judge that I'm a single mom?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.961
Well, maybe if you had come to me

07:53.005 --> 07:54.563
when they first sent the summons, yes.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.768
But now there's nothing I can do.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.606
Well, you know how busy I've been.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.271
Look, it's too late.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.043
You have to go.

08:03.082 --> 08:06.711
Laura, this situation should have been
resolved a long time ago.

08:06.752 --> 08:09.744
- Why haven't you gotten a divorce?
- Well, I was.

08:09.789 --> 08:13.384
I mean we were going to really do it.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.020
I just-- I-- I don't know.

08:16.062 --> 08:19.930
Then I got the job and we moved
and weeks turned into months.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.196
I mean, I don't know.
It's been six years.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.966
Isn't there, like, some sort of
a common law divorce or something?

08:26.005 --> 08:27.836
No, there isn't.

08:31.644 --> 08:34.544
Okay, all right.
So-- so what does this mean?

08:34.580 --> 08:35.979
How bad is it?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.575
Well, Dylan could say
that you took Kelsey to New York

08:38.618 --> 08:39.676
without his permission.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.279
What? Why do I need his permission?

08:42.321 --> 08:43.948
He is the father.

08:43.990 --> 08:47.391
The law says that
both parents need to agree

08:47.426 --> 08:49.155
on the health and welfare of a child.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.993
I mean he could accuse you
of a variety of things--

08:52.031 --> 08:54.932
- child endangerment--
- Oh, you can't be serious.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.936
- I am. Kidnapping.
- What? That is ridiculous!

08:57.970 --> 08:59.562
He can just put himself
on a plane

08:59.605 --> 09:02.165
and fly his butt down here
anytime he wants.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.438
You know that's not how it works.

09:07.513 --> 09:10.073
Ugh.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.517
Okay, all right.
So what-- what are my options?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.453
All right, so this is what
you're gonna do.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.614
You're gonna fly to Texas.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.181
- Okay, but I can't go to Texas.
- Oh yes, you can.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.214
You're gonna fly to Texas.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.022
You're gonna explain
the situation to the judge.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.790
You're gonna tell him
that you moved for work

09:23.829 --> 09:26.491
and although distance
is not perfect for Dylan,

09:26.532 --> 09:28.966
you did what you had to do
to give Kelsey a good life.

09:29.001 --> 09:33.438
Well, you just make that
sound very simple.

09:37.877 --> 09:42.541
Look, you have carved out
a great career for yourself,

09:42.582 --> 09:45.312
but you need to focus on your family,

09:45.351 --> 09:47.945
on your life, okay?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.897
Hey.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.661
- Hey.
- How was your test?

10:01.701 --> 10:04.966
It was easy.
I'm pretty sure I got an A.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.996
You did?
Well, I am very proud of you.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.008
That's great!

10:10.042 --> 10:12.033
Can we get some ice cream
on the way home?

10:12.078 --> 10:16.845
Sure, but-- but first, honey, we have
to talk about something, okay?

10:16.882 --> 10:19.214
What?

10:19.251 --> 10:23.449
Well, you know that Mommy
and Daddy love you very much.

10:23.489 --> 10:24.717
- Yeah.
- Right?

10:24.757 --> 10:25.849
Uh-huh.

10:25.891 --> 10:31.329
Well, sometimes-- sometimes
grown-ups disagree about things

10:31.364 --> 10:36.267
like where to live
and who to live with.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.702
Is this about the letter
from yesterday?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.940
Sort of, yeah.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.636
Am I gonna have to move back to Texas?

10:44.677 --> 10:48.374
Well, I don't know, sweetheart, but...

10:48.414 --> 10:52.248
Mommy does have to go to Texas
to speak to a judge about that.

10:52.284 --> 10:54.514
But I don't wanna move away.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.111
What about school?

10:56.155 --> 10:59.488
- Well, I'll talk to Mrs. Gustafson--
- What about my friends?

10:59.525 --> 11:03.120
Well, honey, don't worry.
We're gonna try to work it out, okay?

11:03.162 --> 11:05.960
But in the meantime we're gonna
have a lot of fun there.

11:05.998 --> 11:06.987
I mean you'll love it there.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.763
They've got horses
and all kinds of animals.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.292
No, I don't wanna move away.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.828
I wanna stay here
with my friends in New York.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.864

all those animals?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.172
We have animals.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.344
We have-- let's see-- a couple dogs.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.377
I'm never sure about
how many cats we have

12:02.421 --> 12:04.548
because we've got coyotes
running around all the time.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.751
- Stop. You'll scare her.
- And we've got chickens.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.657
Well, it's true.
Chickens--

12:08.694 --> 12:13.563
- Look, there's a coyote.
- There's fresh eggs and lambs, sheep.

12:13.599 --> 12:15.624
- We got sheep and we've got--
- Oh, any pigs?

12:15.668 --> 12:16.965
Pigs? Yeah.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.470
Pigs-- coyotes like pigs too!

12:19.505 --> 12:22.303
Don't scare her. Stop it.

12:22.341 --> 12:23.501
I ain't trying.

12:23.542 --> 12:26.136
Anyway, we've got horses.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.806
- Still got Nelly.
- Who's Nelly?

12:28.848 --> 12:32.375
- If you care to know, Nelly is--
- Yes, Dad.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.182
--Well,
was her horse when she competed.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.018
You competed?

12:37.056 --> 12:39.047
Yes, I did.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.685
It was a very long time ago though.

12:41.727 --> 12:46.187
But your grandpa still likes
to talk about it all the time.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.429
- It's cool.
- Beautiful country out here, isn't it?

12:49.468 --> 12:51.732
- Yeah. Look at the mountains.
- Pretty as can be.

12:57.810 --> 12:58.799
How about we make

12:58.844 --> 13:01.005
a quick stop in town
before we get home?

13:01.046 --> 13:03.037
Pastor Frank
would love to see you.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.553
Come on.

13:13.592 --> 13:16.026
Frank, got somebody for ya.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.120
- Well...
- Hi.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.690
- Oh wow!
- Hi.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.396
- What a surprise.
- Great to see you.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.835
Good to see you too.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.361
- Ha!
- There you go.

13:27.406 --> 13:30.534
- Sweetheart, this is Pastor Frank.
- Hi.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.806
- Hi. How do you do?
- Good.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.439
And just who might
this beautiful young lady be?

13:35.481 --> 13:38.973
- I'm Kelsey.
- No! Come on, you're not Kelsey.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.043
Last time I saw Kelsey,
she was only about this big.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.286
Grandpa said you baptized me.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.622
Grandpa's absolutely right.
I did baptize you.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.061
- And my mommy?
- Oh no.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.326
No. No, I'm not quite that old,

13:53.365 --> 13:55.526
but I did marry your mother
and father though.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.058
- Cool.
- That's right, he did--

13:57.102 --> 14:00.265
- actually in this very church.
- Yep, right up there.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.171
- Cool.
- Cool.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.766
So you're in town.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.403
Any chance I might see you
in church on Sunday?

14:07.413 --> 14:10.780
Oh, um, actually we're not
gonna be here for that long,

14:10.816 --> 14:12.283
so I-- I don't think so.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.548
Okay, all right. I understand.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.215
But if anything changes,
your plans-- anything at all,

14:17.256 --> 14:18.814
you know you're always
welcome here, right?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.758
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.488
- Thanks.
- Nice to see you.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.723
Well...

14:24.763 --> 14:26.856
gonna show 'em the sights
of Centerville.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.732
- See you Wednesday, huh?
- Yes, I'll see you Wednesday.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.235
- All right.
- Thanks for stopping by.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.467
Kelsey, nice to meet you again.

14:34.506 --> 14:38.135
- You keep growing, all right?
- I know. She doesn't stop.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.705
Well, here we are.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.512
Here, wait.
Kelsey, get your--

15:18.550 --> 15:20.347
Whoa!

15:25.424 --> 15:27.187
How is she doing?

15:29.128 --> 15:33.258
Well, she's afraid the judge
is gonna make her leave her friends

15:33.299 --> 15:35.597
and move away.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.933
I can't believe he is putting us
through this.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.939
You know, it might be
that they just wanna

15:40.973 --> 15:43.066
get to know each other better.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.668
Dad, they know each other.

15:45.711 --> 15:48.578
They see each other
a couple times a year.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.411
You know what I'm saying.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.146
It's long distance.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.382
We live in different states.
I don't know what else to say.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.654
Honey, you know he cannot afford

16:00.693 --> 16:03.560
to fly back and forth
between here and New York.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.564
- You know that.
- Well, we were just here.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.431
It was four years ago.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.767
But, you know, then maybe
he should have just moved with us

16:14.807 --> 16:16.798
instead of staying here.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.896
Mom!

16:45.938 --> 16:48.304
I'm out here, sweetheart.

16:49.575 --> 16:53.978
Mom, I saw a goat and a sheep
almost knocked me over.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.742
Dad!

16:57.449 --> 17:01.044
No one ever got hurt
by a sheep now. Right?

17:01.086 --> 17:03.111
And Grandpa said he's gonna
teach me how to ride a tractor.

17:03.155 --> 17:06.318
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, really?

17:06.358 --> 17:10.988
Well, like I said, no one
ever got hurt by a sheep, so...

17:11.030 --> 17:13.156
Well, that sounds like a lot of fun,

17:13.198 --> 17:14.994
but we've got
a really big day tomorrow.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.231
So I think we should just--
just get settled right now, okay?

17:18.270 --> 17:19.896
Sure.

17:19.938 --> 17:24.170
And we can save the tractor riding
for another day.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.369
Okay.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.552
I'll drop you off at the courthouse

17:44.596 --> 17:46.689
and show Kelsey around town.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.377
Yes, well, if you just-- hello?

18:01.413 --> 18:05.611
Beth? Wh-- are-- are you there?

18:05.651 --> 18:07.551
Hello, B-- Beth?

18:07.586 --> 18:10.680
No, I just-- oh, come on.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.849
- Come--
- Busy as usual.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.885
Some things never change.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.524
Hello, Laura.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.329
Hello, Dylan.

18:23.902 --> 18:27.235
So you couldn't just pick up
the phone and call me?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.968
Well, did you ever think that maybe
if you hadn't ignored the summons

18:30.008 --> 18:32.238
in the first place I wouldn't
have had to do all this?

18:36.148 --> 18:38.173
- Don't.
- Don't what?

18:38.217 --> 18:41.345
Don't do that--
what you're doing right now.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.513
- Just cut it out!
- I'm not doing anything.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.921
For--
I will see you inside.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.550
Okay.

19:07.579 --> 19:08.568
All rise.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.775
Centerville Family Court
is now in session,

19:10.816 --> 19:13.580
the Honorable Harriet Cramer presiding.

19:13.619 --> 19:16.486
Cramer's the judge?

19:16.522 --> 19:18.422
Do-- do you know her?

19:18.457 --> 19:21.187
She lived next door to us
when I was a kid.

19:21.226 --> 19:24.718
I threw a softball
through her attic window.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.890
Well, maybe she's forgiven you.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.070
Nope. No no no.

19:33.105 --> 19:36.597
We are here for the matter
of Hackett v. Connors

19:36.642 --> 19:38.041
for the custody of Kelsey Hackett.

19:38.076 --> 19:41.341
- Are the parents present?
- Yes, Your Honor.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.645
And if the paperwork is correct,
the parents' marital status

19:44.683 --> 19:48.744
is separated for six years?

19:48.787 --> 19:52.314
I believe I have expressed
my every intent to reconcile

19:52.357 --> 19:54.086
my daughter's relationship
with her father.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.856
- Are you kidding me?
- Mr. Hackett.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.386
Your Honor, my wife moved
to New York City six years ago.

19:59.431 --> 20:01.956
In that time I've had very little
interaction with my daughter.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.093
Okay, it was your decision
not to come.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.001
To leave everything
and everyone I love behind?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.505
You didn't think I was gonna
make it, did you?

20:07.539 --> 20:09.063
You thought what?

20:09.107 --> 20:11.405
I-- I was just gonna get it
out of my system

20:11.443 --> 20:12.933
and come crawling back here?

20:12.978 --> 20:14.445
Of course not.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.504
Your Honor, for the record,

20:16.548 --> 20:19.517
I never prevented him
from seeing Kelsey.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.043
You did that the minute
that you moved 2,000 miles away.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.646
I couldn't see my daughter
for Christmas last year

20:24.690 --> 20:25.918
because I couldn't afford the air fare.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.153
Is it too much to ask that
she comes back here for a change?

20:28.193 --> 20:30.320
It's not like I never came back.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.557
Yeah, the last time
was four years ago.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.795
Well, you try raising a child
while working the long hours that I do.

20:35.834 --> 20:36.994
It's not easy.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.629
Well, if it's so hard, then maybe
you shouldn't have done it.

20:40.872 --> 20:43.841
Apparently she was also too busy
to sign the divorce paperwork.

20:43.875 --> 20:47.606
Your Honor, our marital status
is not the issue here.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.204
No, I'm likin' it. I'm likin' it.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.909
I'll allow you to proceed.

20:50.949 --> 20:53.884
Our daughter has her friends,
her school.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.750
Her whole life is back in New York.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.846
And I'm not trying
to take her away from any of that.

20:57.889 --> 21:01.086
- I just want shared custody.
- Oh, just be honest.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.787
This is about getting
back at me, isn't it?

21:02.828 --> 21:03.817
What?

21:03.862 --> 21:06.262
You hated the fact
that I moved to New York

21:06.298 --> 21:08.926
and now this is some kind of a revenge.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.231
Yeah, my love for my daughter
really revolves

21:11.270 --> 21:13.500
around a deep-rooted desire
to see you suffer.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.563
- Uh-huh! I knew it. See?
- What?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.199
What is wrong with you?

21:17.242 --> 21:18.766
You used to be sweet and kind...

21:18.810 --> 21:21.472
- I am sweet and kind.
- ...and considerate and humble.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.448
You know, I grew up.
Why don't you give it a shot?

21:24.483 --> 21:25.711
Order order!

21:25.751 --> 21:29.084
It is the observation of this court
that both Mr. Hackett and Miss Connors

21:29.121 --> 21:31.783
have some issues to resolve.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.951
- Therefore this hearing is suspended..
- What?

21:34.993 --> 21:38.690
...for three days until both parties
can find some kind of solution.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.061
Oh oh, no no no. No no no.

21:40.098 --> 21:41.588
You don't understand.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.796
I am in the middle
of a very important deal

21:44.836 --> 21:48.033
and I have to get back
to New York, so if--

21:48.073 --> 21:52.271
Apparently you are unable
to properly prioritize your life

21:52.311 --> 21:54.142
on your own, so maybe I can help you.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.272
If this deal is more important
than your daughter,

21:56.315 --> 21:57.407
then by all means you leave.

21:57.449 --> 21:58.939
But if you do, I have no choice

21:58.984 --> 22:02.613
but to award your husband full custody.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.916
That is my final decision.

22:03.955 --> 22:07.413
This court is adjourned
until Monday, February 14th.

22:07.459 --> 22:11.088
Valentine's Day-- that's perfect.

22:11.129 --> 22:14.121
Oh, and by the way,
I strongly advise the two of you

22:14.166 --> 22:17.897
to use this opportunity to discuss
your personal problems.

22:27.579 --> 22:29.911
Well, how was it?

22:29.948 --> 22:31.006
Awful.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.950
The judge adjourned until Monday,
and Dylan and I are supposed to

22:33.985 --> 22:35.748
come to some sort
of an agreement or something.

22:35.787 --> 22:37.687
Well, sweetheart,
you ignored him for six years.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.247
What do you expect?

22:39.291 --> 22:42.783
Well, Dad, for good reason.
He's egotistical.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.296
He's insensitive.
He behaves like a child.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.924
He won't grow up and he acts like this
is just the simplest thing in the world,

22:47.966 --> 22:50.935
like we should just be totally fine
and why can't I just calm down?

22:50.969 --> 22:52.630
And let's just be--

22:52.671 --> 22:54.002
- Great to see you, Dylan.
- Hey, Pops.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.233
- You take care.
- How are you?

22:55.273 --> 22:58.936
I'm gonna go pick up your daughter
over at your Aunt Harriet's.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.807
- "Pops"?
- Yeah.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.941
What are you guys,
like buddies now or something?

23:04.983 --> 23:07.110
Kinda.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.046
That was kinda fun in there--
kinda like old times.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.648
Yes, okay. You know what?

23:13.692 --> 23:15.785
Let's just work this out,
you and I, okay?

23:15.827 --> 23:18.796
How about she will come to you
Thanksgiving and Easter?

23:20.098 --> 23:22.225
Twice a year? Wow.

23:22.267 --> 23:24.599
Okay, fine. What-- what do you want?

23:24.636 --> 23:26.695
Arbor Day or summer solstice
or something?

23:26.738 --> 23:28.569
- What? What?
- Tell you what--

23:28.607 --> 23:30.632
since we have issues to resolve
and we have to come

23:30.675 --> 23:33.735
to some kind of understanding,
why don't we start with lunch today?

23:33.779 --> 23:35.804
Okay, now you're really pushing it.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.714
You, me, Kelsey. I'll make enchiladas.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.081
- You're serious?
- What?

23:40.118 --> 23:42.814
- You used to love my enchiladas.
- You--

23:42.854 --> 23:44.048
Tell you what-- I'll get 'em started.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.455
You guys come on over
whenever you're ready.

23:46.491 --> 23:49.983
I-- I didn't love them.

23:50.028 --> 23:53.122
They were-- they were mediocre.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.864
Sweetie, don't order too much, okay?
We're having lunch with your dad.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.461
- Good morning, Judy.
- Hey.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.734
Laura? Hey!

24:01.773 --> 24:03.502
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm good.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.567
- Nice to see you.
- You too!

24:05.610 --> 24:07.942
I didn't realize that
you're still working here.

24:07.979 --> 24:10.413
Well, I actually own it.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.679
Oh!

24:12.717 --> 24:16.847
Yeah, I bought it from Lillian
a couple of years ago when she retired.

24:16.888 --> 24:20.255
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.726
Give it a look.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.490
This is breakfast down here.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.394
What do you see that you like?

24:26.431 --> 24:28.365
Orange juice--
so you can have orange juice.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.095
- Orange juice and...
- Yeah?

24:30.135 --> 24:31.329
...cheesecake.

24:31.369 --> 24:33.269
- How's Emma?
- She's great.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.433
Here, let me show you.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.443
Oh, she's beautiful.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.173
- She's so cute.
- I know.

24:41.213 --> 24:45.047
She says she wants a little brother,
but, uh, we'll see about that.

24:45.083 --> 24:48.678
- I'm really happy for you.
- Thanks.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.120
So how'd it go this morning?

24:52.324 --> 24:56.226
Oh, I forgot-- everybody knows
everything around here.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.819
That's right.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.728
Well, you know Dylan.

24:59.764 --> 25:02.232
I have been married
to that man for 15 years

25:02.267 --> 25:04.827
and he will never change.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.100
You know,
he might surprise you.

25:07.138 --> 25:08.901
I mean he's been doing great.

25:08.940 --> 25:12.103
Ever since his parents died-- I mean
he whipped that ranch into shape.

25:12.143 --> 25:14.338
He rebuilt the house,
the stables-- everything.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.973
I mean got his new business.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.779
What business?

25:19.818 --> 25:21.615
These.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.682
What-- does he make them?

25:26.725 --> 25:29.091
Yeah yeah, and he's doing
furniture too.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.118
Look at this.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.326
It's beautiful.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.538
That used to be our song.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.053
- Here, take it.
- What?

25:58.089 --> 25:59.784
Oh, come on. No no no.
Don't be silly.

25:59.824 --> 26:00.916
No, you know what? You know what?

26:00.959 --> 26:02.984
This is my homecoming present to you.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.087
I want you to have it. Take it.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.360
Thanks. Thank you.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.697
Now go sit down over there.
I'm gonna get you some real food,

26:09.734 --> 26:12.070

eating in New York.

Oh! Look at you!

27:12.564 --> 27:14.429
You are so big. You are so big.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.765
Oh, I'm dying here.
You've gotten so big.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.066
- Good. I missed you.
- I missed you too, honey.

27:20.105 --> 27:22.096
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Hi, Laura.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.200
- Hi.
- Oh, good to see you.

27:25.243 --> 27:26.710
Wow, Judy wasn't kidding.

27:26.745 --> 27:29.236
I mean you really-- really did
a lot of work to the place.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.747
Yeah, a little of this,
a little of that.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.875
- You like it?
- It looks fantastic.

27:32.917 --> 27:35.784
- I like the mailbox.
- Oh good. You like it?

27:35.820 --> 27:37.412
- Yeah.
- Huh? It's all right?

27:37.455 --> 27:39.719
Oh, you remember Anne Marie.

27:39.758 --> 27:40.747
Oh!

27:40.792 --> 27:42.919
- Of course.
- Yeah, hi.

27:42.961 --> 27:44.292
Anne Marie,
this is Kelsey, my daughter.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.490
Hi, cutie pie.
Hey.

27:46.531 --> 27:48.999
Oh, hi.

27:49.034 --> 27:54.233
Uh, we were in the, um,
drama club together.

27:54.272 --> 27:56.035
- Oh, right right right.
- "Annie Get Your Gun."

27:56.074 --> 27:59.100
- You acted?
- Oh, just-- just a little bit.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.839
A little bit? Are you kidding me?

28:00.879 --> 28:04.076
Your mom almost beat me out
for the part of Annie Oakley.

28:04.115 --> 28:06.242
I did not know that.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.946
Almost.

28:08.987 --> 28:12.923
So you're a doctor now?

28:12.957 --> 28:15.824
PhD-- doctorate
of veterinary medicine.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.794
You don't say.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.797
- She tends to my animals.
- Oh.

28:19.831 --> 28:21.799
I invited Anne Marie to come
join us for lunch today.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.824
- I hope you don't mind.
- Of course not.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.631
I mean...

28:25.670 --> 28:28.468
the more the merrier, right?

28:28.506 --> 28:31.839
I did make her promise to make
her famous dirty rice though.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.434
It's not that good.

28:33.478 --> 28:35.105
Oh, come on.
She's being modest.

28:35.146 --> 28:36.807
You guys hungry? Come on in.
Let's make lunch.

28:36.848 --> 28:38.338
Come on, Daddy.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.318
This is gonna be fun.
This will be really good.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.785
Whoo, you are gonna love
these enchiladas.

28:48.827 --> 28:49.816
Would you like some rice?

28:49.861 --> 28:51.453
And you are gonna love
that dirty rice.

28:51.496 --> 28:53.396
- She's got famous dirty rice.
- Ooh, I'll have some dirty rice.

28:53.431 --> 28:55.058
All right. There we go.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.328
- Want some rice?
- Would you like one?

28:56.367 --> 28:59.029
Yes, please. Mm!

28:59.070 --> 29:01.504
- Would you like it on your plate?
- Looks great, doesn't it?

29:01.539 --> 29:02.870
- Excellent.
- Need some of this?

29:02.907 --> 29:05.273
Mm-hmm.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.971
Here we go.

29:07.011 --> 29:10.105
All right. Wow, look at that plate.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.483
What?

29:21.526 --> 29:24.495
We just like to bless our food
before eating it here.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.225
Oh.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.460
That's fine. That's fine.
Don't-- don't worry about it.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.799
How long has it been
since you were in church?

29:31.836 --> 29:34.964
Well, um...

29:35.006 --> 29:37.236
You can't even remember?

29:37.275 --> 29:38.503
Well, no, we go to church.

29:38.543 --> 29:41.740
I mean we go-- we--
all the time, don't we, Kelsey?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.681
- No.
- Well...

29:44.716 --> 29:47.583
a lot of the time my schedule
doesn't allow--

29:47.619 --> 29:50.087
I mean I work sometimes
on the weekends and--

29:50.121 --> 29:52.885
so we don't always have
the opportunity to go.

29:52.924 --> 29:56.325
Well, that's all right.
Kelsey, would you like to say grace?

29:56.361 --> 29:58.158
- Oh, I don't know if she really--
- No, it's okay.

29:58.196 --> 30:02.360
- I can do it, Mommy.
- Oh. Hmm.

30:05.770 --> 30:08.034
Dear God, thank You
for giving our family

30:08.072 --> 30:10.506
this wonderful food to eat.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.478
And thank You so much
for Mommy, Daddy,

30:14.512 --> 30:18.448
Grandpa and Anne Marie of course.

30:18.483 --> 30:23.284
And I really wanna thank Him
for bringing me back to Texas.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.812
It's so beautiful here.

30:25.857 --> 30:28.587
- That's sweet--
- And I especially wanna thank Him

30:28.626 --> 30:31.288
for bringing Mommy and Daddy
back together again.

30:31.329 --> 30:35.288
- Amen.
- Amen.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.322
- Amen.
- That was beautiful.

30:36.367 --> 30:38.835
- That was good.
- What are you waiting for? Let's eat!

30:40.839 --> 30:43.307
Hey, Kelsey, how's those enchiladas?

30:43.341 --> 30:45.309
They're delicious.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.437
Way better than the food back home.

30:48.479 --> 30:52.609
- Really?
- I mean it's different.

30:52.650 --> 30:55.813
What she means
is I don't always have

30:55.854 --> 30:58.880
the time to prepare
a meal like this.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.117
- Mm.
- Of course.

31:00.158 --> 31:03.150
Dylan said you-- you're working
in a bank back in New York?

31:03.194 --> 31:04.661
Mm-hmm.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.722
We have branches
all up and down the East Coast.

31:07.765 --> 31:10.734
Hmm. So are you a teller?

31:10.768 --> 31:13.430
I'm the VP of retail banking.

31:13.471 --> 31:15.302
Well, that sounds important.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.537
Yes, I oversee over 50 branches--

31:18.576 --> 31:20.874
75 if this merger goes through.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.607
Good for you.

31:22.647 --> 31:24.342
I think it's just great.

31:24.382 --> 31:27.283
- And all while raising a child.
- Mm-hmm.

31:27.318 --> 31:29.582
We do all right. Don't we?

31:30.989 --> 31:33.423
Must be difficult doing it alone.

31:33.458 --> 31:38.122
Yes, well, I-- yes,
I have to admit it is difficult.

31:38.162 --> 31:41.563
But, you know, we can't all be perfect
just going to church all the time

31:41.599 --> 31:43.897
and having a PhD in veterinary medicine

31:43.935 --> 31:46.199
and making perfect dirty rice, so--

31:46.237 --> 31:48.865
May I be excused?

31:48.907 --> 31:52.968
Oh, um, sure, sweetheart.
It's okay.

31:53.011 --> 31:56.139
- Wow.
- Where are you going?

31:56.180 --> 31:57.875
I'm just gonna go talk
to our daughter.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.283
- I'll take care of it.
- Fine.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.581
Wait. You know what?

32:02.620 --> 32:04.611
And for the record, they offered me

32:04.656 --> 32:07.625
the part of Annie Oakley
and I turned it down.

32:13.998 --> 32:16.193
No, they didn't.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.146
Thanks for coming.

32:34.185 --> 32:38.281
Hey, uh, about before, I'm--

32:38.323 --> 32:41.417
Oh, it's all right.
I-- I know it's hard.

32:44.329 --> 32:48.527
So... Anne Marie, huh?

32:51.803 --> 32:53.896
- What?
- Nothing.

32:53.938 --> 32:57.567
I just-- she never really
seemed like your type.

32:59.644 --> 33:04.138
No no no.
Uh, she is just a friend.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.912
Oh, really?

33:06.951 --> 33:10.682
Just a-- a blonde, beautiful,

33:10.722 --> 33:13.748
PhD-carrying woman friend.

33:13.791 --> 33:17.591
Laura, she's just a friend.

33:17.628 --> 33:20.620
- She really likes you, Dylan.
- Well...

33:20.665 --> 33:25.227
You may not see that,
which would make you really dumb,

33:25.269 --> 33:28.705
but I do.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.402
Daddy, can I stay over?

33:31.442 --> 33:34.309
You're gonna have to ask your mama.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.041
Please, Mom?

33:37.081 --> 33:38.742
Please, Mom?

33:38.783 --> 33:41.752
I don't know, Dylan.
I mean she-- she's--

33:41.786 --> 33:43.879
I mean she's never really been
around animals.

33:43.921 --> 33:46.822
And she doesn't have
a change of clothes or a toothbrush.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.725
Laura, it's gonna be okay.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.752
She'll be fine.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.800
- Okay, just for one night.
- Deal.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.064
Come here.

33:59.103 --> 34:01.833
After you give your mama a hug,
go on into the house, peanut.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.205
- I'll be in in a minute.
- 'Kay.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.576
Good night, sweetheart. Mm!

34:09.614 --> 34:12.344
- Love you.
- Give me a kiss. Okay?

34:12.382 --> 34:13.850
I'm gonna see you
in the morning, all right?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.147
- Okay. Love you. Bye.
- Go inside.

34:15.186 --> 34:17.654
I love you too, sweetheart.

34:24.962 --> 34:28.056
So I guess we gotta figure out

34:28.099 --> 34:30.465
what we're gonna tell the judge
on Monday, huh?

34:31.835 --> 34:35.636
I think I know exactly what we should tell
the judge on Monday.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.266
You do?

34:39.310 --> 34:41.744
Dylan, I think you should
revoke your request

34:41.779 --> 34:43.474
and grant me full custody.

34:47.318 --> 34:49.946
You think that's in her best interest?

34:51.889 --> 34:54.414
Well, I think that I know

34:54.458 --> 34:57.292
what's in her best interest
better than you do.

35:00.131 --> 35:02.861
She needs a father.

35:05.636 --> 35:09.299
Well, she's been doing
just fine without one.

35:14.912 --> 35:16.937
- Ah.
- How are you this evening?

35:16.981 --> 35:21.611
- How many in your party?
- Three. We may have a fourth.

35:21.652 --> 35:23.517
Got it.
I've got the place for you.

35:23.554 --> 35:27.183
Thank you, thank you so much.
Excuse me.

35:27.225 --> 35:31.093
Bet you're from Tokyo?
Korea? China?

35:38.236 --> 35:39.225
Hello?

35:39.270 --> 35:41.261
Connors, where are you?

35:41.305 --> 35:42.795
Paul, hi.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.536
I thought I told you--
I have that thing back home.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.407
Yeah, you told me, but I ignored it.

35:47.445 --> 35:51.541
You're supposed to be here.
Remember Mr. Tagiku from Tokyo?

35:52.950 --> 35:55.919
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

35:55.953 --> 35:57.545
Forget it. We have bigger problems.

35:57.588 --> 35:58.577
Oh?

35:58.623 --> 36:00.284
Parker's Heller projections were off,

36:00.324 --> 36:03.122
so the FDlC is threatening
to reject the merger.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.150
What?

36:04.195 --> 36:06.789
We have to refile or the Fed
won't approve the deal.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.095
Oh, no. Well, that's not a problem.
I can fix it--

36:09.133 --> 36:10.794
the first thing, as soon
as I get back next week.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.395
Next week?
I-- I need you here right now.

36:13.437 --> 36:14.836
I can't.

36:14.872 --> 36:17.272
The judge postponed
her decision until Monday.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.572
Monday, fine. Fly back up here.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.475
Spend the weekend on it.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.605
Fly back Sunday night on the red-eye.

36:23.648 --> 36:25.411
You don't understand.

36:25.449 --> 36:27.917
If I leave, she will give
full custody to Dylan.

36:27.952 --> 36:31.149
What kind of lawyer would let her
pull a stunt like that?

36:31.189 --> 36:34.681
I didn't bring one.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.750
You went to court without a lawyer?

36:36.794 --> 36:38.352
Are you crazy?

36:38.396 --> 36:40.523
Would you go on a safari
without a gun?

36:40.565 --> 36:44.399
Would you go swimming
with sharks without a cage?

36:44.435 --> 36:47.233
When my third ex-wife
sued me for alimony,

36:47.271 --> 36:50.968
my lawyer ended up having her pay me
and I still got to keep my dog.

36:51.008 --> 36:53.169
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.769
Big deal? It is a big deal!

36:54.812 --> 36:57.440
The clock is ticking and my future
executive vice president

36:57.481 --> 37:01.076
is stuck somewhere in Arizona.

37:01.118 --> 37:03.177
- Texas.
- Whatever.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.745
Look, I brought my laptop with me.

37:04.789 --> 37:06.689
I will just go through
the revisions with Beth.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.124
Fine, but kid or no kid,

37:09.160 --> 37:11.890
I want you on the red-eye
as soon as this is done.

37:11.929 --> 37:15.660
There is a lot riding on you-- a lot.
Do you follow me?

37:15.700 --> 37:17.793
L follow.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.503
So sorry.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.974
I did not mean to dishonor
our meeting.

37:25.009 --> 37:28.501
- Anyone in the mood for karaoke?
- Not during business.

37:28.546 --> 37:31.481
And if you ever heard him sing,
you wouldn't wanna do karaoke.

37:33.050 --> 37:36.110
You speak English.
We're all on the same page.

37:36.153 --> 37:38.087
- Oh, it's a wonderful world.
- This is marvelous.

37:38.122 --> 37:39.487
What do you recommend,
my dear?

37:39.523 --> 37:41.047
Well, I wouldn't get
the moo goo gai pan,

37:41.092 --> 37:42.150
I can tell you that.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.161
Little Pikachu back there is in a snit.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.095
No moo goo. Uh, rice?

37:46.130 --> 37:47.995
Rice is safe. Rice is safe.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.624
What else can I get for ya?

37:49.667 --> 37:51.225
You've got to have
something to go on it.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.602
What-- and what do you want to drink?
You could use a good stiff one.

37:54.639 --> 37:58.507
Yeah, but I wanna stay healthy,
so vodka and V8 juice.

37:58.542 --> 38:00.976
- Very good.
- Make that two.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.253
Well.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.692
What?

38:18.529 --> 38:22.090
I see you found your old clothes.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.966
Well, I didn't bring enough
for a week.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.664
I wasn't planning on still being here.

38:27.705 --> 38:29.639
It's only four more days, honey.

38:35.179 --> 38:38.842
Laura, if Dylan bothers you this much,

38:38.883 --> 38:42.216
why did you not get
the divorce papers signed?

38:45.690 --> 38:47.851
I don't know.

38:47.892 --> 38:51.953
I just-- I-- I kept putting it off.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.430
I was busy. I mean I don't know.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.392
What?

38:58.436 --> 39:02.304
Just seems to me that someone
who runs such an organized

39:02.340 --> 39:04.740
and strict life as you do...

39:08.079 --> 39:12.015
would find the time
to do something like that.

39:12.049 --> 39:14.381
Good night, honey.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.409
Good night, Dad.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.848
So why did Mommy stop riding?

39:45.883 --> 39:50.217
Whoa now, you know that your mama
was like the best rider in the county

39:50.254 --> 39:52.620
and she could've gone to nationals?

39:52.656 --> 39:55.420
- What happened?
- She had a bad fall.

39:55.459 --> 39:58.155
She broke her collarbone,
sprained her ankle.

39:58.195 --> 40:00.129
That was it. She never rode again.

40:00.164 --> 40:03.031
Was that why you broke up?

40:03.067 --> 40:06.594
A little more complicated
than that, but--

40:06.637 --> 40:08.502
Do you love her?

40:08.539 --> 40:10.370
Of course I love her.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.071
Then what's so complicated?

40:18.616 --> 40:20.846
I'm gonna let your mama
answer that question.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.319
I think you are ready
for a horse ride.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.787
- Yeah!
- Let's find you a horse.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.813
- Hurry!
- Come on, let's go.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.347
All right, you think you got it?

40:28.392 --> 40:29.984
- Yeah, I think--
- You don't need my help?

40:30.027 --> 40:33.326
- I can do it.
- You are an independent girl.

40:33.364 --> 40:37.357
Oh my goodness, look at that. Wow!

40:37.401 --> 40:38.891
So if you had some reins here

40:38.936 --> 40:40.801
and you wanted to control
the direction of this horse,

40:40.838 --> 40:43.102
you'd be able to steer it
just like a little car.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.129
Like this?

40:44.175 --> 40:47.110
No no, but with your-- with your reins.
You just hold it like that.

40:47.144 --> 40:48.236
You give a little turn right there

40:48.279 --> 40:50.179
and then you give a little kick
on the side-- boom.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.944
We'll take it nice and slow.
How do you feel up there? Okay?

40:52.983 --> 40:54.780
- Yeah.
- You gonna fall off?

40:54.819 --> 40:57.151
- No.
- All right.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.815
You look good.
You look natural.

40:58.856 --> 41:01.154
Come on, Jackson,
let's bring it up a little. Whoo!

41:01.192 --> 41:03.820
- Come on, Jackson.
- Come on, Jackson.

41:03.861 --> 41:06.056
Give Jackson a little kick in his side.
There we go.

41:06.096 --> 41:07.757
There you go.
That'll get him going.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.959
Perfect!

41:10.000 --> 41:11.661
There you go.
You're doing great!

41:11.702 --> 41:14.569
That's it! Yes!

41:14.605 --> 41:16.800
You're riding! Hold on.

41:16.841 --> 41:20.333
Stand up in your-- stand up
in your stirrups a little.

41:20.377 --> 41:21.867
You're doing great.

41:21.912 --> 41:24.574
Oh, that was fantastic.

41:24.615 --> 41:27.379
Oh my gosh. Amazing.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.750
Come on down. Oh!

41:29.787 --> 41:33.052
You did good. Oh, so proud of you.

41:36.594 --> 41:39.119
Judge Cramer, hi hi.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.154
I told you I'd see you on Monday.

41:41.198 --> 41:42.631
Oh, I just wanna talk for one minute.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.327
Okay, go.

41:44.368 --> 41:47.269
Now I-- I understand
what you're trying to do.

41:47.304 --> 41:49.465
You just want us to work things out.

41:49.507 --> 41:52.908
And I just want to resolve this
in the quickest

41:52.943 --> 41:55.036
and easiest way for everyone.

41:55.079 --> 41:57.172
You mean for yourself.

41:57.214 --> 42:00.047
No. I mean everyone.

42:00.084 --> 42:02.416
No, wait. I-- you know, I'm sure--

42:02.453 --> 42:05.889
I know that you're so busy
with tons of cases

42:05.923 --> 42:07.754
and I just think
that it would be better

42:07.791 --> 42:11.090
if we handled this as a legal matter.

42:11.128 --> 42:15.394
Oh, and for what it's worth,
I am really sorry about what happened

42:15.432 --> 42:17.832
all those years ago
with the attic window when I was a kid.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.962
Maybe in the city people treat marriage
like some kind of game,

42:21.005 --> 42:23.997
but down here I like to think
of marriage as an institution--

42:24.041 --> 42:26.134
an institution based
on communication.

42:26.176 --> 42:27.575
Now you've
got two and a half days left.

42:27.611 --> 42:29.169
I wouldn't waste any more time.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.271
- But I--
- Your minute's up.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.373
I'll see you on Monday.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.316
So I just went to talk to her
to try to come to an agreement.

42:41.358 --> 42:42.985
I mean just make it a legal matter

42:43.027 --> 42:44.995
instead of all of this stuff
we're going through.

42:45.029 --> 42:47.998
And then she says that marriage
is an institution

42:48.032 --> 42:49.363
based on communication.

42:49.400 --> 42:53.234
I mean we're-- we're talking about custody
here, not couple's therapy.

42:53.270 --> 42:56.865
You know, she probably
just wants what's best for Kelsey.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.568
Well, I think what is best for Kelsey

42:58.609 --> 43:03.273
is that if we just get out of here
as soon as possible.

43:03.314 --> 43:05.179
She has her father's eyes, you know?

43:05.215 --> 43:07.115
Ugh.

43:07.151 --> 43:08.675
Do you know what Dylan did?

43:08.719 --> 43:10.550
Do you know that he invited Anne Marie

43:10.588 --> 43:12.647
to dinner at his house
with us last night?

43:12.690 --> 43:17.354
Yeah, well, she has been spending
a lot of time up at the ranch.

43:17.394 --> 43:19.726
Oh ho ho ho ho.

43:19.763 --> 43:24.393
I know she is just dying
to get in there and push me out.

43:25.636 --> 43:28.366
She has always been
in competition with me.

43:28.405 --> 43:31.238
I mean all through school she just
always had to be better than me.

43:31.275 --> 43:34.210
Laura, don't even.

43:34.244 --> 43:36.007
- What?
- Be honest.

43:36.046 --> 43:39.345
The only reason she is bothering you
is because you're jealous.

43:39.383 --> 43:42.147
Oh! Oh ho ho. Oh, that's insane.

43:42.186 --> 43:44.814
You are afraid that they're gonna
end up together.

43:44.855 --> 43:46.823
Oh, please.

43:46.857 --> 43:49.223
He could do a lot better than her.

43:49.259 --> 43:51.022
Like you?

43:51.061 --> 43:55.191
Like someone... a lot better than her.

43:57.334 --> 44:00.394
You know, I remember
when you first got married.

44:00.437 --> 44:03.702
You always had this way of knowing
what was best for everybody.

44:03.741 --> 44:06.539
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

44:06.577 --> 44:11.173
It means that maybe sometimes
things don't have to make sense.

44:11.215 --> 44:14.673
Sometimes you just have to let go,

44:14.718 --> 44:17.448
live in the moment.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.080
I don't like doing that.

44:19.123 --> 44:20.920
No, you don't. You hate that!

44:20.958 --> 44:23.188
Yes, I hate that!

44:23.227 --> 44:24.421
Whoo!

44:24.461 --> 44:26.759
Ahh!

44:29.733 --> 44:32.099
Ah, there you go.

44:32.136 --> 44:33.626
Daddy, come up here.

44:35.706 --> 44:37.503
All right, what do you say?
Let's go--

44:37.541 --> 44:39.668
let's go chase after that pig.

44:42.813 --> 44:44.747
She's here.

44:44.782 --> 44:47.307
All right.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.785
Kelsey? Dylan?

44:49.820 --> 44:51.481
- Are you back here?
- Mommy, get her.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.082
Okay okay okay okay. I got her.

44:54.124 --> 44:55.921
Okay, wait wait wait! Ahh!

44:55.959 --> 44:57.824
- Ooh!
- You got her.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.796
- Are you okay, Mommy?
- Yeah. Yes, I did.

45:00.831 --> 45:02.355
You all right?

45:02.399 --> 45:04.993
Can I talk to you for a second?

45:05.035 --> 45:08.004
Uh, yeah, sure.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.801
Honey, why don't you go on
and get cleaned up?

45:09.840 --> 45:11.398
- Okay, what---
- Go easy on him.

45:11.442 --> 45:15.378
- We were just having a little fun.
- Oh, okay. I will.

45:15.412 --> 45:18.313
- Aha, hmm.
- You got a little-- a little--

45:18.348 --> 45:20.077
Oh, yeah, you're a riot.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.880
That was pretty funny.

45:21.919 --> 45:24.752
Dylan, she's a city girl.
She could get hurt.

45:24.788 --> 45:26.779
She's fine. It was just a pig.

45:26.824 --> 45:29.759
You remember when we first got married
and I brought home that pig?

45:29.793 --> 45:31.761
- And you thought it was so dangerous.
- It was.

45:31.795 --> 45:33.729
It was a dangerous pig.

45:33.764 --> 45:36.198
Yeah, and then you liked that pig
so much that you named it.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.497
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

45:39.536 --> 45:41.970
- What was it?
- His name was Hoggle.

45:42.005 --> 45:44.906
- Oh, God, Hoggle.
- Uh-huh. And you loved that pig.

45:44.942 --> 45:47.536
Oh, I tolerated that pig.

45:47.578 --> 45:50.138
- What, like you tolerated me?
- Mm-hmm.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.011
Okay, you can try and fool everyone

45:52.049 --> 45:54.108
that you're like
this nice little city girl, but I--

45:54.151 --> 45:55.277
I saw you take that hit.

45:55.319 --> 45:57.549
You took that hit like a country girl.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.078
Okay.

45:59.123 --> 46:02.991
But still, she is a city girl
and you have to be careful.

46:03.026 --> 46:04.516
She's fine.

46:04.561 --> 46:07.689
Oh oh, I forgot--
you are dating a doctor.

46:07.731 --> 46:11.189
Oh, wow!
Well, first of all, she's a vet.

46:11.235 --> 46:13.032
Oh, my mistake. Excuse me. Sorry.

46:13.070 --> 46:15.038
And second of all, we're not dating.

46:15.072 --> 46:16.061
We're just friends.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.971
I have known Anne Marie
a lot longer than you have

46:18.008 --> 46:21.500
and, trust me,
she always has an agenda.

46:21.545 --> 46:24.412
Okay, Mom, I'm ready. Can Sadie come?

46:24.448 --> 46:25.540
Uh, no.

46:27.117 --> 46:30.086
- Why not?
- No.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.179
- Please?
- Absolutely not.

48:02.412 --> 48:04.073
Hello?

48:04.114 --> 48:05.638
Why are you whispering?

48:05.682 --> 48:09.118
Because I am supposed to be eating
with my family right now.

48:09.152 --> 48:10.449
What is going on?

48:10.487 --> 48:11.977
Did you get my email
with the revisions?

48:12.022 --> 48:15.082
Yeah, about that-- the board found out
about the Fed's response

48:15.125 --> 48:17.286
and they called
an emergency meeting-- tomorrow--

48:17.327 --> 48:18.589
and Paul wants you on the phone.

48:18.629 --> 48:22.121
But I-- I am supposed to be
spending time with my family.

48:22.165 --> 48:23.996
That man is on a warpath.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.763
Come on, we both know
how much time you put into this deal.

48:25.802 --> 48:27.667
- Don't blow it now.
- What time?

48:27.704 --> 48:31.196
- 3:30.
- Okay, fine fine.

48:31.241 --> 48:32.469
Okay, great. I'll let him know.

48:32.509 --> 48:34.500
You can also let him know
that he'd better be serious

48:34.544 --> 48:35.772
about that promotion.

48:35.812 --> 48:38.076
- You can tell him yourself tomorrow.
- I will.

48:38.115 --> 48:41.278
Okay, where are you anyway?
In a nightclub.

48:41.318 --> 48:43.183
No, I'm in the Chinese restaurant
on the corner.

48:43.220 --> 48:46.383
Sounds like a nightclub.
All right, bye.

48:46.423 --> 48:47.947
Okay, bye.

48:58.936 --> 49:02.633
Kelsey, do you want some pancakes?

49:02.673 --> 49:04.664
Kelse?

49:20.223 --> 49:23.454
Oh, sweetheart.

49:23.493 --> 49:25.518
Oh, honey.

49:26.697 --> 49:30.656
I'm so sorry that you have
to go through all this.

49:30.701 --> 49:33.636
And your Daddy and I should
be able to handle this

49:33.670 --> 49:35.535
more like adults, but--

49:35.572 --> 49:38.735
It's your fault.
Why did you have to break up?

49:38.775 --> 49:40.970
Why did we have to move away?

49:41.011 --> 49:43.479
Was it because of your accident
with the horse?

49:43.513 --> 49:45.879
No no, honey.

49:47.217 --> 49:51.984
Your daddy and I-- we fell in love
when we were really young

49:52.022 --> 49:55.890
and we just weren't ready
for the responsibility--

49:55.926 --> 49:57.757
You mean you weren't ready for me.

49:57.794 --> 49:59.921
No. No no no no no.

49:59.963 --> 50:02.363
Okay, let's put Sadie down
just for a minute.

50:02.399 --> 50:05.891
Here. Okay okay.

50:05.936 --> 50:08.234
Come here, sit on my lap. Come on.

50:14.177 --> 50:17.169
Of course I don't mean you.

50:17.214 --> 50:19.148
We were too young

50:19.182 --> 50:21.309
and we weren't ready
for the responsibility.

50:21.351 --> 50:24.684
So-- so you just couldn't try
to figure it out?

50:24.721 --> 50:27.622
Well, I did, sweetheart. We did.

50:27.657 --> 50:30.091
Why didn't you try?

50:31.128 --> 50:34.894
Wh-- I-- I--

50:34.931 --> 50:36.398
Do you love him?

50:36.433 --> 50:38.924
Of course I loved him, honey.

50:38.969 --> 50:41.335
No, I asked if you love him.

50:41.371 --> 50:45.137
Of course I love your father.

50:45.175 --> 50:49.509
And I will always always always

50:49.546 --> 50:53.676
have a very special place
for him in my heart.

50:55.218 --> 50:59.552
But, honey, your father and I--
we're different people

50:59.589 --> 51:03.719
and-- and we want different things.

51:03.760 --> 51:08.720
And in the end Mommy wanted a change

51:08.765 --> 51:11.256
and your daddy wanted to stay here.

51:11.301 --> 51:13.735
But I never even get to see him anymore

51:13.770 --> 51:16.102
and we never come to visit.

51:16.139 --> 51:17.128
I know, honey.

51:17.174 --> 51:21.907
Well, New York is really far away
and it's expensive to travel, so--

51:21.945 --> 51:26.348
But if you got back together again,
then you wouldn't have to travel.

51:27.517 --> 51:29.815
Honey...

51:29.853 --> 51:34.483
your daddy and I
are thousands of miles apart.

51:34.524 --> 51:37.015
We are from-- it's like we're
from different worlds.

51:37.060 --> 51:40.826
But you're not from different worlds.
You're both from Centerville.

51:40.864 --> 51:45.267
Honey, New York is our home now.

51:46.303 --> 51:48.931
And your daddy's home is here.

51:51.007 --> 51:53.874
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

51:55.812 --> 51:58.178
Listen. Listen to me.

51:58.215 --> 52:00.183
This is what we're gonna do.

52:00.217 --> 52:04.449
How about you go and get dressed

52:04.488 --> 52:08.356
and then I'm gonna take you riding
at the equestrian center?

52:08.391 --> 52:10.518
- Would you like that?
- Can Sadie come?

52:12.729 --> 52:14.663
I-- you know what I think?

52:14.698 --> 52:19.397
I think that Sadie maybe should
stay here and take care of Grandpa.

52:19.436 --> 52:22.064
- Okay.
- Okay?

52:22.105 --> 52:24.630
Come here.

52:24.674 --> 52:27.302
We're gonna have a great time, okay?

52:27.344 --> 52:29.574
Will you give me a little smile?
A little one?

52:29.613 --> 52:31.774
A little smile? Come on.

52:31.815 --> 52:34.909
That's you.

52:34.951 --> 52:37.078
I love you, sweetheart.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.281
Get dressed.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.817
Come on, let's go, let's go go.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.876
Come on, Hunter. Come on, come on.

53:09.920 --> 53:13.412
There it is. There it is. There it is.

53:13.456 --> 53:15.481
Keep that going. Let's go.

53:18.261 --> 53:21.924
Come on, come on. Yah yah.

53:21.965 --> 53:25.924
- Can you still run like that?
- Oh, that's called cantering, honey.

53:25.969 --> 53:28.995
And, you know, I'm not sure.
It's been a long time.

53:29.039 --> 53:31.803
There you are. There you go.

53:31.841 --> 53:34.332
Come on.

53:34.377 --> 53:36.368
Come on.

53:38.181 --> 53:40.911
Laura, don't tell me
you're riding again.

53:40.951 --> 53:42.782
Oh me? No no no no.

53:42.819 --> 53:44.753
I just brought Kelsey over
to ride Nelly.

53:44.788 --> 53:46.779
Oh, Nelly's a great horse,
beautiful horse.

53:46.823 --> 53:48.757
- Can you show me how to jump?
- Oh!

53:48.792 --> 53:52.421
I really don't think
I'm the right man for that job.

53:52.462 --> 53:53.520
You ought to ask your mother.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.121
She's a much better jumper
than I'll ever be.

53:55.165 --> 53:58.931
Oh, well, Mommy's retired
from that profession.

53:58.969 --> 54:02.598
So I think that-- I think
this might be your man.

54:02.639 --> 54:05.267
Tell you what-- why don't we start
with the easy things first?

54:05.308 --> 54:07.902
You ever feed a horse
an apple out of your hand?

54:07.944 --> 54:10.003
- No.
- Oh, they love that.

54:10.046 --> 54:11.035
Yes, they do.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.844
That's right where
we're gonna start, okay?

54:12.882 --> 54:14.543
- Okay.
- Last one to the barn's a rotten egg.

54:14.584 --> 54:16.552
- One, two, three, go!
- Cheater!

54:16.586 --> 54:19.214
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on.

54:19.256 --> 54:21.656
Oh, you better go. You better go.

54:22.993 --> 54:24.824
Come on.

54:34.871 --> 54:37.101
You're doing great, sweetheart.

54:37.140 --> 54:38.664
Just try to keep your heels down.

54:40.577 --> 54:44.274
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say this place was growing on her.

54:44.314 --> 54:47.681
Yeah, she's having fun.

54:47.717 --> 54:49.810
But it's been hard too.

54:49.853 --> 54:52.481
You know, this whole custody thing--

54:52.522 --> 54:54.490
it hasn't been easy on her...

54:54.524 --> 54:58.221
or me for that matter.

54:58.261 --> 55:02.721
Well, nobody ever said that marriage
was supposed to be easy.

55:02.766 --> 55:07.533
You know, sometimes I wonder
why we should do it at all.

55:07.570 --> 55:09.902
Well, because it's important, silly.

55:09.939 --> 55:12.373
Why do you think marriage
is one of the most popular metaphors

55:12.409 --> 55:14.206
in the Bible in the first place?

55:14.244 --> 55:17.304
"For thy Maker is thine husband;

55:17.347 --> 55:18.837
the Lord of hosts is his name;

55:18.882 --> 55:22.045
and thy Redeemer
the Holy One of lsrael."

55:22.085 --> 55:26.021
See, God refers to Himself as
the husband of lsrael, of its people.

55:26.056 --> 55:28.524
That means that marriage
is meant to be a lifetime union

55:28.558 --> 55:33.723
between a husband, a wife, a child
and God that's not easily broken.

55:36.299 --> 55:39.962
But I-- I look back to when
Dylan and I got married

55:40.003 --> 55:44.064
and I can't even-- I can't even
remember why I--

55:44.107 --> 55:46.735
I feel so disconnected to him.

55:46.776 --> 55:48.744
"I-- I-- I-- I--"

55:48.778 --> 55:51.110
There's always going to be excuses.
There's always going to be accidents.

55:51.147 --> 55:54.048
There's always going to be arguments.
But those aren't reasons.

55:56.453 --> 55:58.114
- I was--
- What?

55:58.154 --> 56:01.612
We drifted so far apart.
That was a long time ago now.

56:01.658 --> 56:03.853
- We don't have any--
- Yes yes yes yes yes.

56:03.893 --> 56:05.554
And yet here you are.

56:05.595 --> 56:07.085
You're hanging out
with your old friends.

56:07.130 --> 56:11.123
You're teaching your daughter
how to ride your old horse.

56:11.167 --> 56:14.261
We missed you, Laura. We did.

56:14.304 --> 56:17.000
And I know you'd hate to admit it,
but I think you kind of missed us too,

56:17.040 --> 56:18.598
even Dylan.

56:18.641 --> 56:20.575
Yeah.

56:23.179 --> 56:24.168
So what do you say?

56:24.214 --> 56:27.911
It'd be awfully nice to see you
at church on Sunday.

56:27.951 --> 56:29.612
- Ah.
- Ah!

56:29.652 --> 56:31.677
- You're very convincing.
- Yes, I know.

56:31.721 --> 56:33.450
- We will try, yes.
- Okay.

56:33.490 --> 56:35.117
- We will try to make it.
- Good good good good.

56:35.158 --> 56:37.353
Thank you very much. Great job!

56:37.394 --> 56:39.794
You look super.
Are you having fun?

56:39.829 --> 56:41.626
Yeah.

56:44.200 --> 56:47.795
- Maybe we'll ride again later, okay?
- Okay.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.940
- Hey, peanut!
- Daddy!

57:01.017 --> 57:03.611
Whoa, man!

57:03.653 --> 57:06.679
Oh, hi.

57:06.723 --> 57:09.021
- Hey.
- What a surprise.

57:09.058 --> 57:10.821
Yeah, your dad told me
you'd be up here.

57:10.860 --> 57:12.020
Oh.

57:12.061 --> 57:14.188
Of course he did. Of course he did.

57:14.230 --> 57:18.724
Yes, he did. Rahr!

57:18.768 --> 57:21.202
So, uh-- so what's up?

57:21.237 --> 57:23.137
Well, I thought since today
was the first day

57:23.173 --> 57:25.368
of the Valentine's Day carnival--

57:25.408 --> 57:26.705
- Carnival?
- Yeah.

57:26.743 --> 57:28.836
I thought we'd go eat
some sugary sweets.

57:28.878 --> 57:31.711
We could ride the carousel,
pan for gold.

57:31.748 --> 57:34.444
Oh, I don't know.
I-- we--

57:34.484 --> 57:35.815
- Come on.
- Please, Mom?

57:35.852 --> 57:38.184
- Just like old times.
- Yeah.

57:41.891 --> 57:44.724
- Oh, all right. Okay.
- Thank you!

57:44.761 --> 57:46.752
Oh, thank you.

57:46.796 --> 57:49.128
I guess we can all have
a little bit of fun.

57:49.165 --> 57:52.430
- No, a lot of it.
- A lot of fun.

57:52.469 --> 57:55.927
All right, I will see you guys at 2:00?
Does that work?

57:55.972 --> 57:58.770
All right, it's a date.

57:58.808 --> 58:01.709
- Okay, you know what I mean.
- I'm just-- okay.

58:01.744 --> 58:03.712
- All right, all right.
- Can Sadie come?

58:03.746 --> 58:05.873
- Who's Sadie?
- The pig.

58:05.915 --> 58:07.143
The pig?

58:07.183 --> 58:09.583
Honey, I think you really wore
the pig out yesterday.

58:09.619 --> 58:11.678
Probably shouldn't bring
the pig to the carnival.

58:11.721 --> 58:15.316
Yeah, you know, I think maybe Sadie
should just stay here this time

58:15.358 --> 58:17.622
- and maybe she can come next time.
- Yeah, I think so. I think so.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.059
- Okay.
- All right?

58:19.095 --> 58:20.528
Boop.
I'll see you guys at 2:00.

58:20.563 --> 58:21.621
- All right.
- Bye, Daddy.

58:21.664 --> 58:23.529
Bye.

59:15.351 --> 59:16.340

- Laura. Hi!

59:16.386 --> 59:17.853
- Hey!
- Hey, hon.

59:17.887 --> 59:20.219
- How are you? Hi, Dan.
- Hello. Good to see ya.

59:20.256 --> 59:21.314
- Good to see ya.
- You too!

59:21.357 --> 59:23.188
Hi! Look at you.

59:23.226 --> 59:26.525
Emma, you got so big!

59:26.563 --> 59:29.259
Looks like you guys
are having a good time.

59:29.299 --> 59:31.927
Whoo! A natural country girl.

59:31.968 --> 59:33.196
Look at that. Look at that.

59:33.236 --> 59:35.363
Yes, we are.

59:35.405 --> 59:37.873
- We are.
- How's it going?

59:37.907 --> 59:39.101
It's good.

59:39.142 --> 59:41.303
You know, he's been
really looking forward to this.

59:41.344 --> 59:42.936
- Oh, really?
- Yep yep.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.003
Really?

59:44.047 --> 59:45.105
- Honey!
- What what?

59:45.148 --> 59:48.140
Look, I'm only saying what he said.

59:48.184 --> 59:49.845
You know what?
We're gonna go ride the ponies, okay?

59:49.886 --> 59:52.218
Yeah, good idea.
Go ride the ponies.

59:54.324 --> 59:56.986
Looks like Kelsey's having a great time
over there on that pony.

59:57.026 --> 59:59.517
She's really having a blast.

59:59.562 --> 01:00:02.531
I mean there is nothing like this
in New York City.

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:05.864
New York City street fair--
there are no ponies.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:10.896
Well, I'm not sure it's really the pony
that's making her so happy.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.432
And you guys look good together.

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:18.504
I know, it's just--
it's not that simple.

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.413
Isn't it?

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:24.011
What do you want, babe?

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:25.543
I--

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.079
- Dylan.
- Hey, Anne Marie.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:29.853
- How are you doing?
- Well, good. How are you?

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:32.258
- Oh...
- ...not that.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.355
- Go.
- Uh, excuse me!

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:37.730
Kelse, look who's here.
Anne Marie's here.

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:41.999
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:45.530
- Look at her go.
- Mm, not bad. Not bad.

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:49.341
- I think she had a good teacher.
- Mm, you know...

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.812
- Hi.
- Oh.

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:53.111
- Is that yours?
- Thanks.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:01:00.186
Yeah, so, um, why don't you let us
have a little-- a little family time...

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:02.783
alone?

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:06.192
- That's funny.
- Hey, Anne Marie, why don't we--

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:08.220
I'll call you tomorrow.
Nice seeing you.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.822
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:10.855
All right, have fun tonight.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.333
- Talk to you later.
- Enjoy.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:13.733
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.704
- Bye.
- Bye, Kelsey.

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.171
Bye bye.

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:21.302
Oh no, she doesn't like you at all.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.575
So a little family time, huh?

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:27.447
- You know what I mean.
- Yep.

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:31.082
I wanna ride on the carousel.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.781
- You wanna ride the carousel?
- Okay.

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:35.120
All right, sounds good.
We'll do that.

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:36.989
We'll do it as a family.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.221
Oh, would you--
know you, that's enough.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.828
- Okay, which one you wanna go on?
- Oops, sorry.

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.837
- This one.
- Okay.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.066
Here we go. All right, babe.

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:53.769
Hey, that looks like a good one, honey.

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:02.140
Oh, here we go.
We're movin'.

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:05.120
Whoo! Here we go.

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:07.054
Lookin' good. Had fun today?

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.557
- Yep.
- Yeah, it's been awesome.

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:10.525
- Go sit down with Mommy.
- Had a good day. What's that?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.494
- Go sit down with Mommy.
- Okay, all right?

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:13.825
- You good?
- Yes.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:14.852
- You gonna be okay?
- Yes. Go.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.957
Okay, sounds good. Oh!

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.163
Man!

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.279
No hands.

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:40.981
You okay?

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.014
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.189
Are you okay, Mommy?

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:52.258
I'm okay, sweetheart, yes.

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:03.144
And you're okay about what?

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:07.138
It just feels so good to be together.

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:10.619
You know?

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:12.712
But-- but--

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.783
But what?

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.462
Everything has changed.

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:24.557
We can't--

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.560
I don't know.

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:35.235
If you could press a button

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.247
that would make things go back
to the way they were...

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.716
would you press it?

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:48.087
♪ But your love never fails ♪

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:51.025
♪ Mm mm ♪

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.757
♪ Oh ooh ♪

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:59.097
♪ You've stayed the same
through the ages. ♪

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.693
You know what, sweetie?

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:03.364
Why don't you go on over
and talk to your Aunt Mary?

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:04.998
- Okay.
- And you guys hang out for a second.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.235
- I just wanna--
- Can I have your hat?

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.708
I just wanna talk to your mommy
for a minute.

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.521
- So--
- So--

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.528
You-- you start. Go ahead.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.731
Um...

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:37.434
I guess I just wanted to say that
I-- despite what you may think,

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.600
I hope that you know that I didn't
mean for any of this

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.439
to be difficult for you or Kelsey.

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:44.878
I know. I know.

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:48.475
You know, after a lot of thinking--

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:53.147
I know I'm a little slow,
but I do finally realize

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:55.714
that the only important thing
in life is family.

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:01.786
Kelsey's gotta know how much
I love and care for her.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:06.325
Oh, I-- I think she does.

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:10.703
I was talking to Pastor Frank
a few weeks ago and he told me that--

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.642
he asked me,
"At the end of your life

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:18.044
are you gonna be happy
with how you did things?"

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:24.174
And the answer was no.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.620
And he showed me that the only thing

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:30.592
that truly matters in life
is who you love.

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:33.561
And to be significant

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.690
I have to put other people
before myself,

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:41.328
so-- I don't know-- I mean I think
maybe asking for custody

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:45.204
was some way for me to...

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:47.869
fix some of the things
I've done wrong.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:53.673
Did you think it would
bring us back together?

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.980
Did it?

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.707
Hey, honey.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.584
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:35.988
You got my lid all dusty. Oh no!

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.324
Just like everything else
you're wearing.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:42.024
All right, sweetheart, you gotta say
good night to Daddy, okay?

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.759
- Night, Daddy.
- Good night, sweetie.

01:06:43.799 --> 01:06:45.289
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.995
I love you.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:51.602
All right, we'll see you.

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.337
- Bye.
- Night.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:29.069
- Samantha Pierce.
- Hey, it's Laura.

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:30.738
There you are.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.577
I have some excellent news for you.

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.912
Oh?

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.974
I had my investigator
look into Mr. Hackett.

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:38.009
You investigated Dylan?

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:41.023
Yep, and they found out
something very interesting.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.957
Wh-- what's that?

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:47.053
Well, apparently his company
is not doing as well as he says.

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:49.564
In fact he's burned through his capital

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.623
and he's running at a severe loss.

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.498
He's bankrupt, Laura.

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:56.835
But-- but his ranch...

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:58.999
Did you know it was up for sale?

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:01.532
- He's selling the ranch?
- Yeah.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.978
Apparently it's the only thing
of value he has left.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:07.812
But, Sam,
that's very important to him.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:10.114
It's been in his family
for generations.

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.449
Look, I know.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:14.615
But the fact is there is no way
that he can support Kelsey

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:17.386
and there is not a judge in this state that's
gonna grant him custody,

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.553
shared or otherwise.

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.663
Laura, I thought you'd be
happier about this.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.634
I know. I know.

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:30.196
Did-- have you told
anyone else about this?

01:08:30.238 --> 01:08:33.299
- Just you.
- Okay, good.

01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:35.002
Keep it that way.

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:37.341
You do understand what I said, right?

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:42.042
- You can't lose.
- I know. I-- just--

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:45.247
just let me think about it first, okay?

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.687
Okay. Of course.
I mean it's your decision.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:50.055
But just remember, you have to be
before the judge on the 14th,

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:52.322
and that's the day after tomorrow.

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:53.828
I'll be on a red-eye
tomorrow night.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:57.662
Then I will see you in the courthouse.

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.692
Okay. I'll see you then.

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:02.727
Bye.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.261
I am hungry!

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.627
Well, set you down there.
What would you like?

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:33.828
- Um, pancakes.
- Uh-huh.

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:35.996
Laura, come down for breakfast.

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:39.596
- Laura!
- Yeah, I'll be right down.

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:42.733
Hello?

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:45.042
It's Sunday morning
and guess where I am.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.274
I--

01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:48.647
I'm in my office
doing the extra paperwork

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.447
you were supposed to be doing!

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:52.545
Well, I'm not actually doing it myself.

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:54.453
Actually I'm more like supervising.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.616
Not that you would know,

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:58.252
because you were not
on the call yesterday.

01:09:58.294 --> 01:09:59.784
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.022
- I forgot.
- I know. I know.

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:03.293
You were too busy hay riding
or cow tipping--

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.630
whatever it is you're doing
down in New Mexico.

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:06.828
- Texas.
- Whatever.

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.461
Connors, I like you--
you know that--

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:10.267
which is the only reason,
as far as I'm concerned,

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.967
that you still have a job.

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.804
You should be managing this.

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:16.072
Would you stop worrying about it?

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:17.601
I have been speaking to Beth

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.910
and we have the entire situation
under control.

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:22.349
I think you should know
I had a lovely conversation

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.976
with Anderson yesterday,

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:26.988
and I think he would
really appreciate that promotion.

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:30.788
Stop worrying about it.
Everything is going to be fine.

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:33.488
I'd worry less if you were here.

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:35.224
You know what?

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:38.631
If you'll excuse me, Paul,
I'm actually going to go have breakfast

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.601
with my father and my daughter.

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:43.230
And I am going to call you as soon
as I am out of court tomorrow.

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.830
Wait a minute.
I have one more thing--

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.534
Okay, bye.

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.783
So how was the carnival?

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:59.481
- It was awesome.
- Uh-huh.

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.649
Mommy and Daddy kissed.

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:05.251
They what?

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:07.387
They kissed.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.363
Morning.

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.457
Good morning, darlin'.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.367
- What's for breakfast?
- Pancakes.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:18.032
So what are you girls gonna do
on this bright sunny day?

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:22.772
Ahem, well, I was thinking
that we might go to church.

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:26.143
What did you say?

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:28.115
I said we might go to church.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.713
Really?

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.222
And today I wanna talk about something
that I haven't talked about

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:43.891
very much in this church-- hello--

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.366
something that is very important.

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.427
I wanna talk about marriage.

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:51.200
Now I've married a lot of couples
over the years,

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.607
some of whom are actually sitting
in this church right now.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.907
They always come to me
with the same wish.

01:11:56.945 --> 01:12:00.346
They want a perfect marriage.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.976
So today I wanna ask everybody here
exactly what is that?

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.509
What is a perfect marriage?

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:07.215
Now a wife might tell me
that a perfect marriage

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:10.054
is one where her husband
is devoted without question.

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:12.993
He's loyal.
He's deeply sensitive to her needs.

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:15.622
But a husband might tell me
a perfect marriage

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:18.428
is one where the wife
goes out on Sunday afternoon

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.594
so he can sit down and watch the game.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.762
Yeah.

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:25.137
My point is everyone has
their own definition

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.472
of what a perfect marriage
should be.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.409
And as long as that's the case,

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.972
no marriage can ever
truly be perfect.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:36.280
Perhaps the question is not
what we want a relationship to be,

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:39.014
but rather what we need one to be.

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:41.454
Maybe there's an emptiness
inside their soul.

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.617
They're looking for
something to fill it.

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:47.857
But marriage is not
some kind of spiritual spackle.

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:50.296
See, only God can fill that void.

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:52.493
What we need is a partnership.

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:55.230
And that, like any partnership,

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:58.671
takes skill, takes effort.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.868
That's why sometimes
all we need to do

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:03.901
when we're faced with these problems
is turn to the Lord.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.647
Listen to the Holy Spirit.

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:13.519
Galatians 5:22 says that the fruit
of the spirit is love, joy, peace,

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:17.116
longsuffering, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness,

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:21.858
gentleness and self-control.

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:25.355
Sounds like a pretty strong recipe
for a pretty strong marriage,

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.959
doesn't it?

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:32.634
Okay, so I'd like to end this sermon
with a message from First Timothy 1:5.

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:37.543
The goal of His command is love
which comes from a pure heart

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:41.572
and a good conscience
and a sincere faith.

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:43.983
So as you go out into the world today,

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.283
remember what the goal
of His command was.

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:49.051
- What is the goal of His command?
- Love!

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.991
Yes, that's right!

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.254
Look at that, we're on time.

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.660
Now go ye, therefore, out into the
world and love one another.

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.254
Go on. Thank you.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.398
Thank you for coming.
It was a pleasure.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.028
Thank you for that short
and inspirational--

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.332
Oh, you're welcome.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.067
The shorter and more inspirational,
the better.

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:08.235
Thanks a lot.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.837
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:20.250
- Everything all right?
- Um...

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.314
you know--

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:24.382
you know you can
always come to me

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:27.224
if you ever need anything, ever.

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:29.093
Thanks.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:33.227
I know how hard you've been
working to rebuild your ranch

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:36.829
and start your career.

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:39.432
And I know that's not cheap,
so I just--

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:42.273
Who told you?

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.711
My lawyer.

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:47.579
- I didn't want you to know.
- I know.

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:49.607
But you realize if this got out--

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:52.017
Well, it's a little bit late
for that, isn't it?

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.112
Well, not necessarily.

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.248
Well, I guess I should
congratulate you then.

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:58.157
Wait. I don't-- what?

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.683
Well, you finally got
what you want--

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:02.356
a reason to take Kelsey away
from me for good.

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:05.491
No, all I'm saying is that
you could have come to me sooner.

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:07.024
Oh, that would've gone over great.

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.469
You don't have to deal with this alone.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.530
You know, I thought things
were getting better for us.

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.768
They were. They are. They are.

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:15.572
And what, you were just out there looking
for information

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:16.600
to use against me?

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:18.579
Did I say I was gonna use
any of this against you?

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.208
- You don't have to.
- I said I want to help you.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.239
Oh yeah, great.

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:25.048
"Um, I can't support myself,
so I had to accept money

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.384
from my soon-to-be-ex wife."

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.683
The judge is just gonna love that.

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.987
No, I don't want you
to lose everything.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.754
I don't care!

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.886
I don't care about my business.
I don't care about the ranch.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.988
I don't care what anyone
thinks about me.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:39.626
- All I care about is my little girl!
- I know that.

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:41.397
Is that why you hired your lawyer?

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:43.563
Because you care so much
about how I feel?

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:46.574
Dylan, I didn't know
what was gonna happen.

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.576
Well, I guess that makes two of us.

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:51.101
Well, maybe we both made a mistake.

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:54.138
Yeah, I think you might be right.

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:56.810
- Wait, Dylan. Dylan, wait.
- Nah, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.581
Wait!

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.588
- Daddy.
- Sweetie, not now.

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:08.792
What happened? What did you say?

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.661
Oh no, nothing, sweetheart.

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.564
You drove him away again, didn't you?

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:14.330
No no no, I didn't.

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:17.429

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:07.491

to come too.

Well, we'll see what Mommy
can do, okay?

Okay.

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:17.597
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.172

- I love you.

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.871
Sweet dreams.

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:42.830
Oh, hey.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.897
You sure looked good out there today.

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:50.763
It's been a long time
since I've been in the saddle,

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.705
that's for sure.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:58.509
Yeah well, you looked good.

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:02.849
Thanks, Dad.

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:04.749
Your attorney called today.

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:09.416
Staying at a motel--
Deerfield, I think.

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.220
It's right over there by the phone.

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:13.887
Okay. Thanks.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.726
What are you gonna do tomorrow?

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:19.257
I don't know.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.826
I have no idea.

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:25.670
Oh, you think that's funny, do you?

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:26.696
Yeah, I do.

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:29.574
You, of all people...

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.203
with nothing to do.

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:33.578
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:40.439
- You okay?
- Yeah yeah, I'm fine.

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:55.660
All rise.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:58.359
Centerville Family Court
is now in session,

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.666
the Honorable Harriet Cramer presiding.

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:08.069
We are here to resume the matter
of Hackett v. Connors

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:09.906
for the custody of Kelsey Hackett.

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:11.536
I see both parents are present.

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:14.173
So if there are no objections,
we may move forward.

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:17.343
Your Honor, I would like
to make a statement.

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.875
I don't suppose "no" is an option.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.753
Your Honor, I left Centerville
six years ago

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.985
to pursue a job in New York,

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:27.825
and that job turned into
a terrific career.

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.422
And I brought my daughter with me
because I didn't think

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:35.664
that my husband was capable
of raising a little girl.

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:40.436
I blamed Dylan for everything
because I never really believed

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:44.434
that he took our marriage
or being a father seriously...

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:49.879
but I was wrong.

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:51.647
What are you doing?

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:54.348
What I should have done
in the first place.

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:57.847
I was the one who left.

01:24:57.892 --> 01:25:02.158
I was the one who prevented him
from seeing his little girl

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:06.531
except for a handful of visits.

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:08.468
And I was the one
that was so busy

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:11.700
that I couldn't even handle
the divorce paperwork.

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:17.477
I neglected my family, my friends,

01:25:17.512 --> 01:25:21.846
my church and my husband.

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:29.414
A good friend told me that
I shouldn't judge him too quickly,

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:32.358
and she was right.

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:34.224
I mean look at him.

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:36.992
He-- he's fixed up the ranch.

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.726
He started his own business

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:42.998
and all the while remaining dedicated
to his family and friends.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:49.099
I think that he deserves
an opportunity

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:52.705
to be a father for Kelsey.

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:57.650
And I have decided that I am not
gonna stand in the way of that.

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:05.551
So if you still want me to sign
that paperwork, I will.

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:09.987
Thank you very much, Laura,
for that very thoughtful statement.

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:12.932
Now if there are no further objections, we
may move forward.

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:15.367
Your Honor, I would like
to make a statement too.

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:16.495
Oh, why not?

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:23.838
See, I missed my daughter Kelsey
more than anything in the whole world.

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:27.279
And these past years
since she's been so far away--

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:29.510
it's broken my heart

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:32.645
in more ways than words can describe.

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:37.548
But I haven't been totally honest.

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:43.189
You see, starting a business
is not easy and it's not cheap.

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:48.028
The truth of the matter is
is that I'm broke.

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:54.905
I even had to put up my family farm
just to make ends meet.

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:57.776
So while I love my daughter Kelsey
with all my heart,

01:26:57.812 --> 01:27:01.748
the truth is is that I just don't have
the money to support her

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:04.251
in the manner in which she deserves...

01:27:06.187 --> 01:27:08.678
not alone.

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:13.956
Laura, I know that our relationship

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:18.261
has had its bumps and bruises.

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:24.033
And I have found you at times
to be uncompromising,

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:28.475
obstinate, stubborn.

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:31.706
But these last few days

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:35.113
I remembered that you are also honest,

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:39.518
kind, sweet, loving

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:43.217
and, above all, brave.

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:47.627
I saw this girl take a hit
from a pig like a true country girl.

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:51.223
Laura, I think it's amazing
that you made it in New York.

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.962
And I think it's even more amazing
that you raised our daughter

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:56.493
all by yourself there.

01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:03.106
All those years ago
I will admit I didn't follow you

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:06.773
because I didn't think you'd make it.

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:09.544
I was wrong.

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:11.848
I should have had more faith in you.

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:13.877
For that I'm sorry.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:19.187
I don't know much about the city.

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:22.754
I know I don't know a lot
about a lot of things.

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:25.595
But I do know this--

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.830
I want Kelsey back in my life.

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:31.464
But I also want you.

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:33.531
I don't want custody

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:36.042
because I don't want a divorce.

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:39.171
Laura, I love you.

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:41.704
I wanna be with you,

01:28:41.749 --> 01:28:43.944
except this time for good.

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:47.716
So if that offer to move to the city
with you still stands,

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.746
I'd like to discuss it.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:54.752
I love you too, Dylan.

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:06.204
Um, order order order!

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.834
Now I can see that
when I advised you two

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:12.368
to discuss your personal matters,
you took me seriously.

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:14.313
I see no reason to move further.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.944
So unless either of you party disagree,
this court is adjourned.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:21.750
Come on.

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:23.950
- Yes.
- Ha ha!

01:29:23.991 --> 01:29:27.427
Oh, wait.

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:29.453
- It's Paul.
- Oh.

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:33.331
I have to take it
and it will take one second.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.359
Hi, Paul.

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:36.893
Excellent news, Connors.

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:39.600
Beth resubmitted
the paperwork you sent her.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.074
Looks like the Feds are gonna
okay the deal after all.

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:45.011
That is fantastic news!

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.378
You see, I told you you had
nothing to worry about.

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.849
So everything
set down there in Arkansas?

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:52.478
It's Texas, Paul.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:56.684
My secretary has booked you
on a 3:30 flight back to New York.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.214
Oh, you know,

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:01.717
I think I'm actually gonna
stick around here for a few days.

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:02.752
What?

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.731
Well, everything's
all wrapped up over there,

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:06.131
so I don't see any real need

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:07.657
- to rush back.
- But--

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:10.500
Oh, and that
executive vice president offer?

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:12.699
- Yeah, about that--
- I accept.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.867
- But--
- On one condition.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:17.503
Okay, what?

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:20.013
I wanna work from home one day a week

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:22.038
and no nights and no weekends.

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:25.348
I wanna spend time with my family.

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:27.946
Okay, Connors, I think
we can accommodate that.

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:31.481
- Oh, and one more thing.
- All right.

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:34.120
It's Hackett.

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:37.325
I don't care what you call yourself,
as long as you get the job done.

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:40.334
Bye, Paul. Happy Valentine's Day.

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:47.564
Family values-- wow.

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:50.805
I like it.

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:53.313
Get me marketing.

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:55.679
Whoever's there, yeah.

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:58.412
Yeah, it's Paul.
Yeah-- okay, I'll wait.

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:01.889
Yay.

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:04.289
Oh, boy. This is just
gonna be so great,

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:05.314
- isn't it?
- It is.

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:07.691
- Oh, bravo!
- Daddy!

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.059
- Hi!
- Hey!

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:10.222
Here we are.

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:12.528
Hi! Ho! Ah, man, you are big and fat.

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.558
- Dad, your shoes.
- I will never forget that.

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:17.833
Hi. Word travels fast.

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:20.033
- Hey, there we are. There we are.
- Congratulations.

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:21.371
- We're gonna give it a shot.
- Thank you.

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:22.876
- It was quite a ride, Pop.
- We're so happy.

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.605
You sure are patient.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:27.045
- Thanks.
- "Good things," as you said.

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:28.571
Oh.

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:30.106
Welcome home, honey.

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:32.676
Thank you very much. Good work.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.154
Can't tell you how proud I am.
Great job.

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:37.521
Oh, you know, I was thinking about
what you said at the service yesterday.

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:39.651
And while I don't know
what a perfect marriage is,

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:42.185
I sure am ready to put
all the effort and hard work

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:44.926
and everything I can into my family.

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:46.058
All right, that's great.

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.829
Don't forget, the Holy Spirit's
always there to help.

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.564
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:51.595
- You're welcome.
- We're going off to Wednesday's.

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:53.937
Yeah. Hey hey, but remember,
next time you come into town,

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:55.806
stop by the church. I'm comin'!

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:57.572
- All right.
- Thank you, sir.

01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:59.273
- Bye.
- All right, you guys.

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:00.974
- We'll see you next time.
- Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.915
Don't forget to say goodbye
to your friend.

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:05.009
- Oh yeah.
- We'll talk.

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:08.021
- Yeah, you'll send me the bill.
- Oh yeah.

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:09.682
Come on.

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:11.885
- Well...
- So?

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:13.052
...what do we do now?

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:15.995
I don't know.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:18.555
Well, there is room for you
in New York.

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:20.066
Are you serious?

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:23.093
As long as you promise
not to give up your ranch.

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:24.331
Come on!

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:27.432
Well, we're gonna need a place to stay
when we come back and visit, aren't we?

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:28.464
- All right.
- Yes.

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:29.840
- Right? Wouldn't you like that?
- Yes.

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:31.435
You guys want to have a place
to stay here in town,

01:32:31.479 --> 01:32:32.468
we can make that happen.

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:33.810
- That sounds good.
- Good.

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:38.342
I never-- I don't wanna forget
where we came from.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.183
Yeah, I know.

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.416
So what now?

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:46.790
I think that we should all
go for a ride.

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:48.317
- On horses?
- Yeah.

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:49.659
- Oh yeah.
- You wanna do that?

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:50.925
- You wanna do that?
- Yes!

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:52.091
- Let's go.
- Come on now, let's go.

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:53.122
- Ready?
- Here we go.

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:55.727
Whoo!

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.435
Look on over there.

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:03.340
