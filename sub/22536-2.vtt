WEBVTT

00:04.200 --> 00:06.293
If you need anything...
We're working with

00:06.300 --> 00:08.461
Homes for humankind to
build houses in new york.

00:08.470 --> 00:10.461
I'm your mother, amber--
I get to worry.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.028
I arranged to be the chaperone
on the school trip, and they're

00:12.040 --> 00:14.258
Counting on me.
You get on the bus, you don't

00:14.280 --> 00:15.770
Talk to me,
you don't look at me.
This is agent finley's

00:15.780 --> 00:17.179
First inner perimeter
assignment.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.499
But you'd take a bullet
for me, right?

00:18.510 --> 00:19.841
I was trained_
to protect your life.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.715
I wouldn't be here if I weren't.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.312
Koz:
We know who you are.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.947
We talked to the agents
in that other suv.

00:24.950 --> 00:25.985
Movement!

00:25.990 --> 00:27.389
Hurst?

00:27.390 --> 00:29.517
In 15 seconds, a truck
is going to pull up.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.385
You are going to get off
this bus and onto that truck.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.153
"some of your parents have had
tracking devices implanted

00:35.160 --> 00:37.390
Under your skin or
in your t... Teeth."

00:37.400 --> 00:40.289
Amber: _
"we have removed these deVIces.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.632
"as you can tell
from the way you were taken,

00:42.640 --> 00:43.891
"we are professionals.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.400
"we are also very comfortable

00:45.410 --> 00:47.230
With the use of force."

00:47.240 --> 00:49.071
And I don't want to hear any
"you're too emotionally close

00:49.080 --> 00:50.229
To do your job clearly" crap

00:50.250 --> 00:52.172
Because your niece
is on that bus.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.978
Your sister gives us access.
We're not on _
speaking terms, Sir.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.244
Now you are.
And you just want
to see your kid.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.138
I know I said I never wanted to,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.583
But now... I need to.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.387
Francis:
You need to ask yourself
right now,

01:03.390 --> 01:06.086
How far are you willing to go?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.954
What would you do
for your child?

01:09.060 --> 01:10.550
Man:
11 million driven down

01:10.570 --> 01:12.663
From the_ casino
In atlantlc crty,

01:12.670 --> 01:15.195
Six and a half million
from the big box stores,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.065
And one and three-quarter
million from personal loans

01:17.070 --> 01:18.367
From the board
of directors.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.667
Do you know how
hard it is

01:19.680 --> 01:20.760
To get this much
actual folding money

01:20.780 --> 01:22.270
In eight hours?

01:22.280 --> 01:23.872
Meg...

01:23.880 --> 01:25.541
This is not a good idea.

01:25.550 --> 01:27.541
As your legal counsel,
I am counseling you

01:27.550 --> 01:29.518
To call the fbi.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.385
These people who took amber...

01:31.390 --> 01:34.848
They also took
the president's son.

01:34.860 --> 01:37.920
They have eluded detection
from what I can only imagine

01:37.930 --> 01:40.524
_ Must be most of
this country's resources.

01:40.530 --> 01:44.296
What exactly do you
think the fbi can do?

01:44.300 --> 01:47.019
They want $20 million
in non-traceable cash.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.429
I will give it to them...

01:49.440 --> 01:52.603
If that's what gets
my amber back.

01:54.610 --> 01:56.373
(camera clicks)

01:58.810 --> 02:00.107
That's it?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.372
Just her?
That's it?

02:09.790 --> 02:11.781
And then finley saved my life.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.497
This was after
finley was shot?

02:14.500 --> 02:16.297
And did you see who shot him?

02:16.300 --> 02:18.291
I was shot by agent hurst.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.767
Woman:
Your partner.

02:19.770 --> 02:21.431
As of yesterday.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.795
I had never met him before;
I'd heard of him, though.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.437
He's a legend in the service.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.465
A man who used to run
the president's detail,

02:27.480 --> 02:29.107
A pistol instructor
at the academy,

02:29.110 --> 02:31.078
Shoots you at close range.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.571
So my question for you,
agent finley, is:

02:33.580 --> 02:35.741
How come you're not dead?

02:35.750 --> 02:40.119
I've been asking myself
that very same question.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.156
Sometimes when
you’re
rea/
scared...

02:42.160 --> 02:44.082
That's not technically true.
What?

02:44.090 --> 02:45.580
What's not true?

02:45.590 --> 02:47.922
That fear degrades the integrity
of the human memory.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.592
In fact, the action
of the adrenal-cortical system

02:50.600 --> 02:52.363
Causes hyper-alertness.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.122
This is what happened.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.596
Finley saved me.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.160
He killed that man
who wanted to take me.

02:58.170 --> 03:00.138
Dunn: The agent you
replaced in the car?

03:00.140 --> 03:02.131
Valens.
Hurst said he had the flu.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.005
Agent valens is missing.
We can't find him anywhere.

03:04.010 --> 03:05.807
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

03:05.810 --> 03:07.607
Hurst said he had the flu.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.043
The voice on the walkie,
the man you talked to,

03:10.050 --> 03:11.881
That wasn't hurst?
No.

03:11.890 --> 03:14.552
Had you ever heard it before?
No. So when do
I get my badge

03:14.560 --> 03:16.482
And my gun back?
I need to get back out there.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.481
No. You lost those kids,
agent finley.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.787
You're off the field.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.360
All of my life,
all I ever wanted to be

03:22.360 --> 03:23.793
Was a secret service agent.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.665
Well, I hope
you enjoyed the one day

03:25.670 --> 03:27.023
You finally got to be one.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.234
Your next interrogator is here.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.196
Have they made any demands?

03:42.080 --> 03:44.719
Let's place the next call.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.988
Man:
I’m sure your brother
WI7/ be home soon.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.324
He's just on a trip
with some friends.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.228
(phone ringing)

04:03.100 --> 04:05.739
(phone continues ringing)

04:10.410 --> 04:11.672
Hello?

04:11.680 --> 04:13.545
Francis (distorted):
Mr. Ambassador.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.245
Who is this?

04:15.250 --> 04:18.845
I need you to ask yourself
what will you do for your child.

04:18.850 --> 04:21.148
How far will you go?

04:28.760 --> 04:31.126
Woman:
Ballard school grid completed.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.189
(phone ringing)

04:34.100 --> 04:37.433
(indistinct chatter)

04:39.440 --> 04:41.408
(phone ringing)

04:41.410 --> 04:44.470
Woman: Students' gps trackers
not responding.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.610
Finley:
Movement!

04:56.420 --> 04:58.479
Hurst?

04:58.490 --> 05:01.857
Worst first day ever,
huh, bitch?

05:03.430 --> 05:05.625
(door closes)

05:09.270 --> 05:11.659
Pick it up.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.139
Pick up the pencil.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.448
I need you to copy this.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.600
You what?

05:20.620 --> 05:22.918
I _need it written
In your hand.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.115
So it looks like me
who did all this?

05:25.120 --> 05:28.487
You'll be admired...
Agent hurst, when this is over.

05:28.490 --> 05:31.857
The meticulous planning,
the sheer vision.

05:33.490 --> 05:35.799
But now you have
a lot of work to do,

05:35.800 --> 05:38.189
So I need you to begin.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.331
Start here.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.308
Woma n :
My husband cal/ed

05:49.310 --> 05:51.505
Two days ago,
said that he'd taken

05:51.510 --> 05:53.774
Our daughter tory,
and not to tell anyone

05:53.780 --> 05:56.442
Or it would be bad for her.

05:56.450 --> 05:58.680
I guess I never knew him.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.188
Is that the man my husband shot?

06:03.190 --> 06:04.657
Excuse me.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.059
Just what the hell
do you think

06:06.060 --> 06:07.186
You're doing here,
secret service?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.849
This is where
the fbi works.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.623
Agent finley,
I thought I made it clear

06:10.630 --> 06:11.824
You are not working this.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.627
Yes, agent dunn,
you did.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.461
This is a secure floor;
how did you get in here?

06:16.470 --> 06:17.596
I invited him.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.702
Don't you have work to do?

06:23.710 --> 06:25.871
Before you speak,
I want you to listen.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.507
Agent finley here
is the only person

06:27.520 --> 06:29.340
Who has seen the faces
of the kidnappers,

06:29.350 --> 06:31.818
The only person who has heard
their actual voices.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.685
Only person to have
killed one of them,

06:33.690 --> 06:35.419
If you're counting.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.183
You may speak
when I point to you.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.225
So he's with you.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.687
With me for-for how long?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.053
Until I say he's not with you.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.550
Sir, with me as fbi,

06:43.570 --> 06:44.650
As secret service?

06:44.670 --> 06:46.194
Olsen:
With you as our only lead

06:46.200 --> 06:48.020
On the day when
the US. President's son

06:48.040 --> 06:49.393
Has been kidnapped with you.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.337
_ Woman:
Director olsen,

06:53.340 --> 06:54.534
We got a hit on hurst's car.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.007
Go.

06:56.010 --> 06:57.534
Both of you.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.575
Now.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.969
Thank you.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.148
Ian:
Hey.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.426
You have to talk, beth ann.

07:14.430 --> 07:18.093
You have _
to say something.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.091
You know what
I was thinking about?

07:20.100 --> 07:22.091
What you said on the bus.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.729
You were gonna run away
when we got to new york.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.059
You meant that, didn't you?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.901
You weren't kidding.

07:29.910 --> 07:33.368
It'd be pretty messed up
if you were gonna run away

07:33.380 --> 07:35.541
And ended up
getting kidnapped.

07:35.550 --> 07:39.543
That's me--
pretty messed up.

07:41.890 --> 07:44.586
They used a knife
on him, ian.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.820
And they made us watch.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.550
(whispers):
I know.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.829
Does it say anything
about hurst?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.899
Do you see anything
about him?
Here.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.343
"unconfirmed involvement

08:05.350 --> 08:07.102
With kyle devore's
protective detail."

08:07.120 --> 08:08.644
Kyle: Anything about
why hurst did it?

08:08.650 --> 08:10.140
Amber: No, but they
arrested anton's dad.

08:10.150 --> 08:11.845
What?
Here, look.

08:11.850 --> 08:14.148
They said they arrested
anton's clad.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.582
They're not saying why.

08:15.590 --> 08:17.080
Sloan: Does anyone
even know anton's dad?

08:17.090 --> 08:18.250
Luke: The whole country's
looking for us.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.659
How can they not find us?

08:19.660 --> 08:21.992
They shot down a drone.
"a top secret drone

08:22.000 --> 08:23.251
"was downed
in maryland yesterday

08:23.270 --> 08:24.623
"in search of the children

08:24.630 --> 08:26.791
Of the world's
most powerful parents."

08:26.800 --> 08:29.598
Guess that means they're
not looking for you and me.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.191
Nash: And what
about demands?

08:31.210 --> 08:32.939
Does anyone see if
the kidnappers have made any?

08:32.940 --> 08:34.760
No. It says here no
group has come forward

08:34.780 --> 08:36.634
To claim responsibility
and no demands have been made.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.833
We know that's not true.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.147
Girl:
How do we know that?

08:39.150 --> 08:41.141
Because of this newspaper.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.811
Because amber got a
proof-of-life picture taken.

08:42.820 --> 08:43.878
They're negotiating
with her parents

08:43.890 --> 08:45.778
Right now.
He's right.

08:45.790 --> 08:48.213
If they took that picture,
that means they're negotiating

08:48.220 --> 08:49.949
With your parents, amber.
Sloan: But why just her?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.052
Beth ann:
Because her mom has

08:51.060 --> 08:52.789
The most money.
Will she pay it?

08:54.360 --> 08:55.896
So you're getting
out of here.

08:55.900 --> 08:59.028
You're going home.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.861
I can't be
the only one.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.930
Find your clothes! Now!

09:05.640 --> 09:09.132
If you have meds,
they are in this box.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.869
Move!

09:12.680 --> 09:14.079
Where's my father?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.139
Why won't you let
him come back out?

09:16.150 --> 09:17.469
Answer me!

09:17.490 --> 09:19.242
Is he okay?

09:19.250 --> 09:22.708
Man:
The voice on the phone asked

09:22.720 --> 09:26.554
What we'd do for our child.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.154
Will we kill?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.765
Will we take
another's life?

09:33.400 --> 09:36.665
For that is
what we must do now.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.070
Dunn:
You asked him
to put you on this,

09:50.090 --> 09:51.580
Didn't you?
You went to olsen.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.512
I pointed out to him
what I had seen

09:53.520 --> 09:55.750
And suggested that I could
be useful to this operation.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.887
That man I killed--
you ID. The body?

09:57.890 --> 10:00.051
Nope. No match on
prints, dental or dna.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.550
The guy was a ghost.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.552
Felt like special forces,
though-- guy was tough.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.561
But you were tougher.

10:06.570 --> 10:08.697
Yes, ma'am,
in that moment, I was.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.099
Tough and useful,

10:10.110 --> 10:12.533
And yet 26 kids go
missing on your watch.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.804
You still think
I'm In on It.

10:14.810 --> 10:16.573
No, I don't.

10:16.580 --> 10:19.401
I just think you're
real bad at your job,

10:19.410 --> 10:22.117
Agent finley.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.577
(siren chirps)

10:24.590 --> 10:26.444
Make the right up ahead.
They're all going straight.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.087
They will all get stuck
at the bridge.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.285
You want to make the right.

10:31.890 --> 10:34.154
(tires screeching)

10:42.740 --> 10:44.833
(ringing)

10:50.240 --> 10:51.673
Meg.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.443
Noah.

10:53.450 --> 10:56.339
There was no reception until
we got back to the trail head.

10:56.350 --> 10:58.113
Is it true?

10:58.120 --> 10:59.747
Was amber on that bus?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.285
Yes. Someone took her.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.258
Oh, my god.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.659
VVho?

11:05.660 --> 11:07.150
Who has her?
We don't know.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.491
So she's just
out there somewhere?

11:08.500 --> 11:09.751
Nobody knows anything?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.249
Did you talk to your sister?

11:11.270 --> 11:13.761
Yes. She says just to sit tight

11:13.770 --> 11:15.965
And let the fbi
do their job.

11:15.970 --> 11:17.790
This is about
the president's kid, right?

11:17.810 --> 11:19.459
And once they deal with that,

11:19.470 --> 11:22.109
They'll let amber
and the rest go, won't they?

11:22.110 --> 11:23.702
Don't you think, meg?

11:23.710 --> 11:25.678
Are you okay?

11:25.680 --> 11:28.979
I-I don't know how I am.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.470
This is like a bad dream.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.708
I mean,
she was just here.

11:42.830 --> 11:45.162
There's a plane waiting for you.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.525
Get on it
and come home, noah.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.792
Okay.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.970
Girl;
_ Rachman/noﬁj
SIx moments mUSICaUX.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.744
The first piece,
andantino in h—f/at minor,

12:02.750 --> 12:04.069
Is 113 measures long.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.580
Sharlene, you okay?

12:05.590 --> 12:07.217
E-ﬂat minor,

12:07.220 --> 12:08.756
Played at 92 quarter
notes per minute.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.058
131 measures long, the
most of all the pieces.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.755
Can you shut
your friend up, please?

12:12.760 --> 12:14.318
Very compassionate, luke.

12:14.330 --> 12:16.059
131, the second shortest
in terms of playing time.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.550
Just three and
a half minutes.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.322
Shar, look at me.

12:19.330 --> 12:21.730
Look at me, shar!

12:21.740 --> 12:23.230
I got to get
out of here.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.730
Right now.
I have to go.

12:24.740 --> 12:27.709
My audition slot at
julliard in new york.

12:27.710 --> 12:30.406
Ten years, five
hours a clay.

12:30.410 --> 12:31.707
I can't be here,
I just can't.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.904
They'll hold your slot.

12:32.910 --> 12:34.047
I promise.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.371
I need them to
take my picture.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.417
I need them to take my picture
like yours so I can go.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.842
You.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.112
No...
Will you take
my picture?

12:45.290 --> 12:47.383
You. The ambassador's kid,

12:47.400 --> 12:49.356
Come with me.
Sharlene: Why him?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.554
Boy: No, no...
Why not me? Why him?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.798
No, no, no, no!

12:51.800 --> 12:53.028
No! No!

12:53.030 --> 12:54.463
He doesn't have a camera.

12:54.470 --> 12:57.132
Boy:
Please, please, no!

12:57.140 --> 12:58.937
This is different.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.931
A decorated
secret serVIce agent

13:00.940 --> 13:02.805
And loving father
steals his own kid,

13:02.810 --> 13:04.209
Then kidnaps
the president's son.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.802
That add up to you, dunn?

13:05.810 --> 13:07.641
It's agent dunn.
And he shot you, right?

13:07.650 --> 13:09.242
You did see him
shoot you?

13:09.250 --> 13:11.411
Yeah, but like you said,
why didn't he kill me?

13:11.420 --> 13:14.082
I'm working on that.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.149
You want to wait for
backup, agent dunn?

13:16.160 --> 13:18.481
Not especially. You?

13:18.490 --> 13:20.128
(cocks gun)

13:21.000 --> 13:23.298
Olsen gave it
back to me.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.362
Fbi! _
Secret serVIce!

13:42.920 --> 13:44.808
It's valens.
Hurst's partner.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.927
He's still alive.

13:59.770 --> 14:01.465
What's with the mattress?

14:01.470 --> 14:04.337
Muffles the sound.

14:04.340 --> 14:07.764
Hurst said valens called
in sick-- the flu.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.129
I'll call this in.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.606
Call fbi, not
secret service.

14:11.610 --> 14:12.838
We get this first.

14:12.850 --> 14:14.408
I'll call an ambulance first.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.269
Secret service!

14:18.290 --> 14:20.440
Yeah, me too.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.314
So how about you just
lower that knife?

14:22.320 --> 14:23.856
I don't know you.
And I don't know you.

14:23.860 --> 14:25.225
I'm fbi.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.050
Yeah? Since when do
secret service and fbi

14:27.060 --> 14:29.324
Work together?
Step away from her

14:29.330 --> 14:31.195
And we'll talk about that.
Where's hurst?

14:31.200 --> 14:32.895
That's what we're trying
to find out.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.027
Step away from her and help us.
Where the hell is hurst?!

14:35.040 --> 14:37.235
Looks like he tied you up
and left you here

14:37.240 --> 14:39.003
And then kidnapped
the president's kid.

14:39.010 --> 14:40.238
That is crazy.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.537
You tell_me
what Is gomg on

14:41.540 --> 14:42.768
Right now.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.775
I'm gonna turn this on.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.547
Woman (over tv):
...With all airports and borders

14:50.550 --> 14:52.518
Still closed in the wake
of yesterday's kidnapping.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.080
Another ballard student,
emma breen, has been...

14:55.090 --> 14:58.082
...First time in history
a sitting president's child

14:58.090 --> 14:59.557
Has been abducted.

14:59.560 --> 15:00.720
There's no official word yet...

15:00.730 --> 15:02.698
Kyle?

15:02.700 --> 15:06.727
Now... You give me
my knife back, or I blow

15:06.740 --> 15:09.129
A hole right
through you.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.201
Where's aziz?

15:19.210 --> 15:21.349
What have you
done with him?

15:21.350 --> 15:23.113
And where is
beth ann's father?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.849
Sort... The...

15:24.850 --> 15:26.818
Clothing.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.055
Amber:
Why would they take my picture

15:31.060 --> 15:32.584
But not aziz's?

15:32.590 --> 15:34.251
Maybe they're
taking it back there.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.955
Didn't sound like
they were taking his picture.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.099
Does anyone still hear him?

15:38.100 --> 15:40.523
No. Not anymore.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.589
You're standing
on my shirt.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.089
Yo. Zombie.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.135
You're on my shirt.
Sorry.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.869
(fabric rips)

15:48.880 --> 15:51.235
Look what you did.
I said I was sorry.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.945
You ripped my shirt.
Take it easy, luke.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.440
It's just a shirt;
she said she was sorry.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.372
You know what this
shirt costs?

15:56.380 --> 15:57.608
I think you're overreacting.
Maybe it's not about the shirt.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.588
Don't tell me I'm overreacting.

15:59.590 --> 16:00.887
This shirt costs more than

16:00.890 --> 16:02.585
Your low-rent dad
makes In a week.

16:02.590 --> 16:03.887
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:04.960 --> 16:06.450
Back off, food stamp.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.325
Luke, that's enough!

16:09.600 --> 16:11.488
Quit it. Quit it now, luke.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.025
Lighten up, lqle.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.762
Keep it.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.192
It's ruined anyway.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.636
Sorry.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.277
_He can be a
dIck sometImes.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.838
He's always a dick.

16:26.850 --> 16:29.410
And I can take care
of myself, thanks.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.309
Everyone on the floor! Now!

16:32.320 --> 16:34.311
On the floor! Down!

16:34.320 --> 16:37.016
No one talks!

16:37.030 --> 16:38.679
Silence!

16:40.490 --> 16:42.720
(motorized humming)

16:43.930 --> 16:45.522
(whispering):
Drone.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.090
It's a drone.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.339
Francis (distorted):
Stanton park, first bench.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.331
Northeast corner.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.171
I have left a package for you.

17:00.180 --> 17:02.171
Bring it into your embassy.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.388
Do not open it.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.278
This is the right one?

17:07.290 --> 17:09.588
The voice said
to look here, yes.

17:16.630 --> 17:18.291
We should go to the fbi.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.767
We are way beyond that.

17:27.010 --> 17:29.672
When it comes
back, same drill:

17:29.680 --> 17:33.138
On the floor, mouths shut!

17:41.990 --> 17:43.480
It was a drone, looking for us.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.310
Jin: They must have this
place shielded against

17:45.330 --> 17:49.050
Thermal imaging, but if we make
noise, the drone could hear us.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.721
So what do we do
if it comes back?

17:50.730 --> 17:52.425
If it can hear us,
we can't just stay quiet, right?

17:52.430 --> 17:54.159
Sloan: _
If we make n0Ise,

17:54.170 --> 17:56.195
We'll just end up like
aziz and beth ann's dad.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.907
But if it passes by again
and finds nothing,

17:58.910 --> 18:00.400
Then they'll cross this
place off their search.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.105
We do nothing.

18:02.110 --> 18:04.078
We stay quiet.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.570
They took your
picture, amber.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.172
They're negotiating
with your parents.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.579
If you get out,
you can tell people

18:08.580 --> 18:09.911
What this place
looks like.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.569
Amber, it's very
important for you

18:11.590 --> 18:13.217
To remember as much as you can.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.780
Don't worry
about that, mr. Nash.

18:17.190 --> 18:18.589
Okay, so it's agreed.

18:18.590 --> 18:21.457
If it comes back,
we lay on the ground

18:21.460 --> 18:22.996
And we keep quiet.

18:25.430 --> 18:27.694
Valens:
Last thing I remember,

18:27.700 --> 18:30.965
I was in the car
having coffee with hurst.

18:30.970 --> 18:32.062
Then I felt dizzy.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.935
I woke up in that room

18:33.940 --> 18:35.874
With you looking at me, and...

18:35.880 --> 18:38.804
Sorry about that.
I didn't know who you were.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.801
How's the throat?
Where'd you get the coffee?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.071
Hurst brought it to the car.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.911
Hurst gets you
out of the way,

18:43.920 --> 18:45.376
Puts a newbie on the detail,
then the kidnapping goes easier

18:45.390 --> 18:47.210
And he doesn't have
to shoot a friend.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.211
No way hurst has
anything to do with this.

18:49.220 --> 18:52.781
I've known him forever.
He's the guy who takes a bullet.

18:52.790 --> 18:55.156
Maybe I should show you the hole
he put in agent finley's side.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.492
Where'd he get you?
Between the fastener
on the vest.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.128
Hell of a shot.
Yes. The secret service has

19:00.140 --> 19:01.459
An excellent record
of marksmanshIp.

19:01.470 --> 19:02.835
Agent valens,
in the period of time

19:02.840 --> 19:04.262
Preceding hurst
closing your coffee

19:04.270 --> 19:05.908
And rendering
you unconscious,

19:05.910 --> 19:09.676
Did you notice anything
peculiar about his behavior?

19:09.680 --> 19:12.308
That day, we were
doing routine security runs,

19:12.310 --> 19:15.074
Checking routes--
just the two of us.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.173
And he took 60 minutes
of personal time.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.612
Where'd he go?

19:18.620 --> 19:20.417
I don't know.
Where were you?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.115
Waiting in the car.
You didn't ask him
where he went?

19:22.120 --> 19:25.157
He's a man. _
He took personal tIme.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.422
What else do I
need to know?

19:26.430 --> 19:27.954
And where exactly were you

19:27.960 --> 19:30.599
When agent hurst took
his personal time?

19:30.600 --> 19:33.125
I want to see my kid.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.461
And I want to see mine.

19:34.470 --> 19:37.359
Your daughter
is in the other room.

19:37.370 --> 19:40.362
Yes, but she won't
let me see her.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.439
Not really see her.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.603
You're a father.
You understand.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.840
Your daughter
hears things,

19:47.850 --> 19:51.809
She sees things, and...
Then she closes her heart.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.344
And that's how your book ends?

19:53.350 --> 19:55.045
One big, happy family?

19:55.060 --> 19:57.620
Your kid giving you a
"father of the year" coffee mug?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.121
I think it's time
for you, agent hurst,

20:00.130 --> 20:01.757
To go into the hole.

20:03.130 --> 20:05.564
You said I could
see my kid.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.195
There you go.
(clears throat)

20:11.210 --> 20:12.905
Where's the money now?

20:12.910 --> 20:15.470
It's moving.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.138
(phone ringing)

20:18.150 --> 20:19.742
Hello?

20:19.750 --> 20:21.741
Look out the window.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.342
Do you know where you are?

20:23.350 --> 20:25.580
I'm where you told me to go.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.945
(distorted):
Have you ever been here before?

20:29.660 --> 20:31.059
No, I don't think so.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.880
I don't think so, either.
This is where

20:32.890 --> 20:35.256
The people who work for the
people who work for you live.

20:35.260 --> 20:36.591
Is this where you live?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.488
You want to know about me?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.923
Here's what you need to know.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.762
I'm the man with a gun
to your daughter's head.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.000
Please don't hurt her.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.270
I brought the money
you asked me to.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.736
What do you want me to do?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.706
In a magazine interview,

20:53.720 --> 20:55.369
You once said
that being a parent

20:55.380 --> 20:57.575
Is the most difficult job
in the world.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.114
Do you really believe that?

20:59.120 --> 21:00.678
Yes.

21:00.690 --> 21:02.282
You said, "amber

21:02.290 --> 21:04.713
Is what makes life worthwhile."

21:04.730 --> 21:06.220
Do you believe that?

21:06.230 --> 21:07.686
Yes.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.895
Then take that left ahead,
go down the ramp

21:09.900 --> 21:12.152
And prove it.

21:35.220 --> 21:37.984
(pounding)

21:38.960 --> 21:40.484
Out of the car, ms. Fitch.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.388
Leave the keys.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.729
Over there in the trunk.

21:53.510 --> 21:56.172
(vehicle drives off)

22:02.350 --> 22:04.978
(panﬁng)

22:28.810 --> 22:31.176
Susie...

22:31.180 --> 22:33.603
It's meg.

22:33.610 --> 22:35.441
I screwed up.

22:35.450 --> 22:37.042
Bad.

22:37.050 --> 22:39.041
I need help.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.053
Meg:
A phone was sent to me.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.824
I got a call.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.549
A processed voice
told me that

22:51.570 --> 22:54.323
If I wanted _
to see amber agaIn,

22:54.340 --> 22:56.558
To get that money together
and where to take it.

22:56.570 --> 22:58.629
I'd have
given them anything.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.528
Keep going.
What happened next?

23:00.540 --> 23:03.509
A man who looked
homeless, um,

23:03.510 --> 23:06.001
Took the money, and...

23:06.010 --> 23:08.604
All they left was this.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.424
Never thought
of calling the fbi?

23:19.430 --> 23:23.389
If not me, why would you
trust me with this

23:23.400 --> 23:26.221
Than one of the other 10,000
agents working on this today?

23:26.230 --> 23:30.189
I thought...
I thought I could get her back.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.839
I thought that
ifI did this

23:32.840 --> 23:36.332
That... She'd be
in my arms by now.

23:38.180 --> 23:40.045
I'm sorry.

23:40.050 --> 23:41.540
Sorry you did
it or sorry

23:41.550 --> 23:43.575
It didn't work out
the way you wanted?

23:43.580 --> 23:44.842
Now, that's enough.

23:44.850 --> 23:47.114
I did what I thought
was best for amber.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.008
That's just you though,
isn't it, meg?

23:49.020 --> 23:50.954
Always what you think is best.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.622
Well, why would I not do
what I think is best?
What good would that do?

23:53.630 --> 23:56.190
There are other people
in the world besides you.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.350
Yes. My daughter is one of them.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.931
Will you be arresting me now?

24:04.940 --> 24:07.465
It's not illegal
to pay a ransom.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.277
But lying to a
federal agent is.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.599
I told you everything.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.134
The phone they
called you on?

24:12.150 --> 24:13.606
The man took it with the money.

24:13.610 --> 24:15.305
Amber's photo
was all you got?

24:15.320 --> 24:17.174
Yes.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.241
Susie, all our kids

24:20.250 --> 24:22.810
Are worth more than $20 million.

24:22.820 --> 24:24.959
They wanted cash
from me.

24:24.960 --> 24:28.282
Cash is for now.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.849
I just paid for whatever
they're gonna do next.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.798
Okay.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.163
Okay what?

24:42.180 --> 24:43.579
Okay, luke is a click.

24:43.580 --> 24:44.774
All the time.

24:44.780 --> 24:47.601
Then how come
he's your friend?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.815
I don't know.

24:49.820 --> 24:52.584
Just kind of
always has been, I guess.

24:52.590 --> 24:54.945
So that's how you live it, huh?

24:54.960 --> 24:57.281
It is what it is.

24:57.290 --> 24:58.689
Must be nice.

24:58.690 --> 25:01.022
Oh. I get it.

25:01.030 --> 25:03.294
Get what?
You're one of those people
who thinks

25:03.300 --> 25:04.653
They know me because
of where I live.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.490
That's cool.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.095
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
and see how you were doing.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.533
But whatever.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.701
Super boy.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.008
I'm not living off food stamps
or anything. It was just that...

25:16.010 --> 25:19.343
You got issues with your dad
and luke pushed the button.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.641
What was that about?

25:25.650 --> 25:28.244
I'm not really sure.

25:30.490 --> 25:33.823
Beth ann, no one's
paying our ransom.

25:33.830 --> 25:35.559
When that drone
comes back...

25:35.560 --> 25:37.198
I know.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.964
May be our
only chance.

25:39.970 --> 25:41.824
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

25:41.840 --> 25:43.660
How come you're still here?

25:43.670 --> 25:46.059
I'm working on what happened.
How come you're still here?

25:46.070 --> 25:47.799
My mom is talking
to my dad's lavwer.

25:47.810 --> 25:49.402
Did you get stitched up?

25:49.410 --> 25:50.809
Yeah. Good as new.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.300
You figure out
why your partner shot you?

25:52.310 --> 25:53.846
Between us, I think
someone made him do it.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.477
But it's just a hunch.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.812
The stomach has more nerve cells
than the spInal cord,

25:57.820 --> 26:00.186
So there is a scientific basis
for gut feeIIngs.

26:00.190 --> 26:01.680
What's with the map?

26:01.690 --> 26:04.056
The man that shot me
spent an hour here

26:04.060 --> 26:06.551
The other day without telling
his partner what he was doing.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.324
Can I ask you a question?

26:09.330 --> 26:13.096
Out on that road,
how come you picked me?

26:14.030 --> 26:15.861
Why was I the
one you saved?

26:15.870 --> 26:19.033
You were the only one
I could get to, anton.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.268
But, look...

26:20.270 --> 26:21.703
Don't feel bad.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.634
I usually don't get
picked for stuff.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.747
Anton, the pakistani ambassador
had a kid on that bus, right?

26:30.750 --> 26:32.274
Yeah. Aziz.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.281
Why?

26:38.690 --> 26:40.726
Man:
Now you need to go.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.129
I don't want to leave you.

26:42.130 --> 26:43.893
You can't be here
when It happens.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.094
You can't be anywhere near.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.591
Come back
when It's over.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.831
Our son will need you
when it's over.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.977
That thing you said
about my dad,

26:56.980 --> 26:58.607
My issues--

26:58.610 --> 27:00.077
Why'd you say that?

27:00.080 --> 27:02.401
You weren't talking to him
when you got here.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.944
That's pretty harsh

27:03.950 --> 27:06.089
Considering the
circumstances.

27:06.090 --> 27:08.081
And I know you think
I'm a golden boy,

27:08.090 --> 27:10.479
But I got a pretty messed up
relationship with my dad, too.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.855
Super boy.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.154
I said "super boy,"
not "golden boy."

27:18.300 --> 27:20.791
Gunman:
Everyone In here and down.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.324
Now!

27:34.480 --> 27:36.619
What did
your sister want?
She did something stupid.

27:36.620 --> 27:38.815
I'm having one of the
other agents deal with it.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.640
You want to tell me
about it?
Nope.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.685
I want to figure out why
hurst took his personal time

27:42.690 --> 27:45.386
A block from the
pakistani embassy.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.525
Francis (distorted):
At 4:15, a large host/7e force

27:54.540 --> 27:56.269
l/l/Il/ enter your embassy.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.636
You must accomplish
the second part of your mission

27:58.640 --> 28:00.608
Before then.

28:00.610 --> 28:03.738
Your son misses you very much.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.474
The fbi have come about aziz.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.209
What are you talking about?

28:09.220 --> 28:11.211
There are two in
the waItIng room.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.044
Dunn:
Mr. Ambassador,

28:14.060 --> 28:15.140
May we have a word?

28:15.160 --> 28:18.288
Yes. Please come in.

28:21.490 --> 28:22.957
Is everything
okay here?

28:22.960 --> 28:24.552
It has been a stressful time.

28:24.570 --> 28:28.028
Mr. Ambassador, according
to your security logs,

28:28.040 --> 28:30.292
A secret service agent
hurst came to see you.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.734
Yes, he... Came to speak with me
about the bus trip.

28:32.740 --> 28:34.230
Finley:
That would be something

28:34.240 --> 28:36.333
He would speak
to your own security about.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.978
There would _be no need
to see you In person.

28:37.980 --> 28:39.504
I thought it was odd.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.000
Dunn: Are you sure you
don't want to sit down?

28:41.020 --> 28:42.647
You're not
lookIng well.

28:45.590 --> 28:47.888
Mr. Ambassador,
at any time

28:47.890 --> 28:49.346
After agent hurst
came to see you,

28:49.360 --> 28:51.385
Did you find a cell
phone in your office?

28:51.390 --> 28:53.858
A phone which your own security
would not have allowed

28:53.860 --> 28:56.226
Through any other way?
You need to go now.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.528
A phone upon which instructions
were issued to you?

28:58.530 --> 29:01.863
I see you have a look on your
face that I've seen before.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.361
The look of a parent being
forced to do something

29:04.370 --> 29:05.837
For his child.

29:06.710 --> 29:09.429
This is sovereign territory

29:09.440 --> 29:11.670
Of the republic of pakistan;
you have no authority here.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.999
You need to go.

29:13.010 --> 29:14.773
Foreign territory
in the middle of d.C.

29:14.780 --> 29:16.441
If you want to hide something
from american authorities,

29:16.450 --> 29:17.872
This would be the
place to put it.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.347
Finley, lock
the door.

29:22.690 --> 29:26.228
Mr. Ambassador, you want us out,
but you haven't called security.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.084
Why?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.091
Please...

29:30.100 --> 29:32.193
You need to help me.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.861
Help you do what?

29:38.040 --> 29:40.634
Help me kill this man.

29:45.110 --> 29:47.772
(drone buzzing in distance)

29:50.820 --> 29:52.549
Help! Help!
Help us!

29:52.550 --> 29:54.040
Could you
please help us!

29:54.050 --> 29:56.041
Please help us!

29:56.060 --> 29:59.257
(buzzing continues loudly)

29:59.260 --> 30:01.125
(buzzing stops)

30:04.330 --> 30:06.321
You two.

30:06.330 --> 30:09.060
Backs against the wall.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.662
Koz:
You were looking

30:10.670 --> 30:12.365
For the troublemakers;
there they are.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.003
We still going
through with it?

30:18.010 --> 30:20.649
Yes. We are.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.928
(shouts)

30:54.110 --> 30:56.670
(whimpers)

30:59.450 --> 31:02.044
Where's the ambassador?

31:05.330 --> 31:07.628
Where's the
ambassador?!

31:07.630 --> 31:10.690
In his office.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.725
_Turn the
ﬁrst one on.

31:12.730 --> 31:15.198
(beeping)

31:18.810 --> 31:20.334
Who is he?

31:20.340 --> 31:21.705
_ _ He's the
InteIIIgence offIcer here.

31:21.710 --> 31:23.575
Finley: And what happens
when you kill him?

31:23.580 --> 31:26.640
I take the key card
he carries around his neck.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.003
I open that door.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.147
Finley:
What's behind that door?

31:30.150 --> 31:32.675
I don't know.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.817
He doesn't work for me.
He runs our spIes here.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.419
(phone ringing)

31:38.430 --> 31:39.681
Dunn.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.329
Kyle devore's gps
is back online.

31:42.330 --> 31:44.389
We tracked it
to the pakistani embassy.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.528
The president's son
could be in that building.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.259
Swat should be on scene.

31:49.270 --> 31:51.397
(siren wails)
(tires screeching)

31:53.010 --> 31:54.659
(indistinct shouting)

31:58.680 --> 32:01.740
You hear what
olsen said?
Yes, ma'am, I did.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.411
It's gonna take a while for swat
to get through security.

32:03.420 --> 32:04.739
Do you want
to wait for backup?

32:04.750 --> 32:06.240
Not especially, no.

32:09.020 --> 32:10.385
Get him up here.
Do it now.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.756
If you want that key card,

32:12.760 --> 32:14.284
You'll have to kill him.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.619
Make the call.

32:26.370 --> 32:27.928
(speaks foreign language)

32:29.610 --> 32:30.838
Where's that door?

32:56.640 --> 32:58.733
If you know
what's behind this door,

32:58.740 --> 33:01.004
Now_would be
a good tIme to tell us.

33:01.010 --> 33:03.501
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.408
(scanner beeps)

33:24.000 --> 33:26.195
Dunn, are you seeing this?

33:30.640 --> 33:32.267
Rangers.

33:32.270 --> 33:33.760
These are americans.

33:33.770 --> 33:36.068
What is going on here?

33:41.610 --> 33:43.214
(scanner beeps)

33:48.390 --> 33:52.451
Man:
Station orange c-0-2-9-3.

33:52.460 --> 33:55.088
Code word.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.625
Station orange c-0-2-9-3.
Code word.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.637
Fbi is pulling
the soldiers out now.

34:08.640 --> 34:11.029
They were reported
missing in action,

34:11.050 --> 34:13.143
No one was looking for them,
but you got the fbi

34:13.150 --> 34:14.572
To storm a foreign embassy

34:14.580 --> 34:16.343
And pull the soldiers
out of that basement.

34:16.350 --> 34:18.648
You did it.

34:18.650 --> 34:21.141
Not yet. Almost.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.582
Let's give the fbi enough time

34:22.590 --> 34:25.081
To take a good long look
at those soldiers.

34:25.090 --> 34:27.058
Then we finish this.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.422
Dunn.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.668
Tell me what you see.

34:35.670 --> 34:37.262
Two men, mid-20$,
both unconscious.

34:37.270 --> 34:38.532
Dunn, are they american?

34:38.540 --> 34:40.906
They've been through something,

34:40.910 --> 34:43.071
Both pretty ragged, but yes,
these look like our boys, sir.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.036
What the hell were they doing
down there?

34:45.050 --> 34:46.335
I don't know.

34:46.350 --> 34:47.703
And kyle devore's chip?

34:47.710 --> 34:50.838
It was in a box
on the ambassador's desk.

34:50.850 --> 34:51.839
Blue team

34:51.850 --> 34:53.044
Checking in.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.938
Copy. About to clear
the embassy.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.279
Man:
Alpha, what's your status?

34:56.290 --> 34:57.882
Francis:
Thatis long enough.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.619
Are we ready for extraction?

34:59.630 --> 35:02.087
Assets are in place.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.897
Then let's take
those soldiers.

35:03.900 --> 35:06.767
Shut down the fbi
communIcatIon system.

35:06.770 --> 35:09.193
I want them dumb and blind now.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.758
Turn the other tracker on.

35:10.770 --> 35:15.059
Tracker two coming online
in three, two, one.

35:15.080 --> 35:19.198
Sir, another hostage's gps
tracker is coming back online.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.472
(beeping)
but...

35:20.480 --> 35:22.107
Olsen:
But what?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.747
But this can't be right.
Where is it coming from?

35:23.750 --> 35:26.071
Right here. It's tracking
to this building, sir.

35:26.090 --> 35:29.048
(alarm buzzing)

35:29.060 --> 35:30.254
Dunn?

35:30.260 --> 35:32.455
Dunn, are you there?

35:32.460 --> 35:35.327
Sir? Sir?

35:35.330 --> 35:37.321
Man:_ All our lines
are In lockdown.

35:37.330 --> 35:38.888
Locating the tracker
here set off

35:38.900 --> 35:40.663
The _internal fbi
securIty protocol.

35:40.670 --> 35:42.991
The line went dead.

35:45.170 --> 35:46.398
Lost radio contact.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.738
(indistinct chatter)

35:49.740 --> 35:52.334
This is not right.
Very not right.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.942
The kidnapper used
the ambassador

35:53.950 --> 35:56.407
To open that basement
door, and the fbi

35:56.420 --> 35:59.071
To get these soldiers
out onto the street.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.986
So, what does he do next?

36:05.990 --> 36:07.480
How do they look?

36:07.490 --> 36:09.583
Vital signs are very low;
pulse, respiration,

36:09.600 --> 36:11.090
Blood pressure,
well below normal.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.328
What was happening here?

36:12.330 --> 36:14.298
We're working that out.

36:14.300 --> 36:16.165
We're gonna move them now.

36:16.170 --> 36:18.035
What hospital you
taking them to?

36:18.040 --> 36:19.496
Collins general.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.330
We're gonna
ride with you.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.534
No problem.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.235
We can take you both
if you want.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.716
Worst first day
ever, huh, bitch?

36:43.360 --> 36:46.022
(shell casings clinking)

36:50.540 --> 36:52.565
Finley?

36:52.570 --> 36:54.629
Yeah. I met
that guy before.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.835
He was there when
they took the kids.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.808
You said they all had masks.

36:58.810 --> 37:01.699
Some things people say to
you, you just never forget.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.870
Okay.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.815
Maybe not really bad
at your job.

37:08.820 --> 37:10.549
I've got shots
fired, men down.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.312
Where are the soldiers?
Fbi has them.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.685
Our men are dead.
Fbi has both soldiers.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.224
(sighs)

37:16.230 --> 37:18.152
Kill the kid.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.966
He's en route.
I'll make the call.

37:25.040 --> 37:28.259
Hmm. Wait.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.009
Wait.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.830
His parents did as I asked.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.408
We got in that room.

37:33.410 --> 37:37.039
They did what I asked them.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.847
Aah! We failed, not them.

37:38.850 --> 37:41.284
Now what?

37:41.290 --> 37:45.750
Now, we call the next parent
and the next parent and the next

37:45.760 --> 37:47.284
Until I'm shaking
the president's hand

37:47.290 --> 37:49.383
In the rose garden,
and he's thanking me

37:49.400 --> 37:50.856
For my service to this country.

37:50.860 --> 37:54.068
But they kept
those soldiers alive.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.391
That means the lenox program's
still operational.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.561
There's more
proof out there.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.368
Open a secure line.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.008
Deal with the troublemakers.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.484
What does "no
talking" mean?

38:16.490 --> 38:19.209
Both:
No talking.

38:39.480 --> 38:43.416
Man:
Station orange c-0-2-9-3.

38:43.420 --> 38:44.739
Code word.

38:44.750 --> 38:47.344
That's a cia station message.

38:47.350 --> 38:50.581
That pakistani isi officer
was calling his cia handler.

38:50.590 --> 38:52.319
It's a black site.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.356
A cia black site inside
the d.C. Pakistani embassy.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.453
Why would the cia
hold american soldiers there?

38:57.460 --> 38:59.121
Why does the
kidnapper want them?

38:59.130 --> 39:01.462
(urgent chatter nearby)

39:01.470 --> 39:04.098
(steady beeping)

39:07.610 --> 39:09.828
(steady beeping continues)

39:13.980 --> 39:16.574
(high-pitched chirping)

39:31.060 --> 39:33.051
Gps tracker.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.288
This is the source.

39:45.980 --> 39:50.917
sometimes I feel like
a motherless child

39:50.920 --> 39:57.086
sometimes I feel
like a motherless child

39:57.090 --> 40:02.084
sometimes I feel like
a motherless child

40:02.100 --> 40:05.524
just a long way
from my home...

40:05.530 --> 40:08.294
(phone ringing)

40:09.900 --> 40:11.492
The boy you let go--

40:11.510 --> 40:13.933
Did his parents do
what you asked of them?

40:13.940 --> 40:15.430
Francis (distorted):
Yes.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.839
I did what you asked.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.432
I gave you that money,

40:18.450 --> 40:20.270
I got the photo
into the fbi.

40:20.280 --> 40:23.738
Now, you get me my daughter
back, and you do it now.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.513
sometimes I feel like...

40:25.520 --> 40:27.112
You're not like the others.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.509
_You and I--
we're just gettIng started.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.681
(line clicks)

40:31.690 --> 40:33.658
What did you do, meg?

40:36.430 --> 40:41.220
a true believer...

40:41.230 --> 40:43.994
I lied to my sister.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.631
oh, true believer...

40:49.640 --> 40:51.505
And I didn't get amber back.

40:53.110 --> 40:59.345
just a long way
from my home...

41:08.390 --> 41:10.392
Where's my daughter?

41:10.400 --> 41:13.096
Upstairs.

41:13.100 --> 41:19.266
sometimes I feel
like a motherless child

41:19.270 --> 41:24.071
sometimes I feel like
a motherless child

41:24.080 --> 41:30.349
just a long way
from my home

41:32.120 --> 41:38.355
oh, sometimes I feel
like I'm almost gone...

41:41.260 --> 41:43.023
Janice, open the door!

41:43.030 --> 41:44.691
_ I'd like to come
Into my house now.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.656
Janice.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.422
Beth ann:
Mom changed the locks.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.169
Okay, okay,
but you can open the door,

41:50.170 --> 41:51.990
Right, let your dad in?
Mom says that I can't,

41:52.010 --> 41:54.808
That we need time
away from you.

41:54.810 --> 41:56.505
Beth ann, honey, open the door.

41:56.510 --> 41:59.707
O-open it.
Just let me see your face.

41:59.710 --> 42:01.473
I'm going to my
room now, dad.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.277
I'm gonna put
headphones on.

42:03.280 --> 42:07.148
Beth ann! Beth ann!

42:07.150 --> 42:09.289
Beth ann!

42:09.290 --> 42:14.978
oh, true believer

42:15.000 --> 42:21.018
just a long way
from my home.
