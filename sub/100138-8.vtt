FATHER MACPHAIL OVER TANNOY:
For each and every one of you...

00:15.200 --> 00:18.431
...going out to fight
this abominable foe...

00:19.400 --> 00:23.280
...in the face of an attack
on everything we hold sacred...

00:25.040 --> 00:29.193

I believe you preferred the old one?

04:25.840 --> 04:27.877
It's been quite a journey to get here.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.310
That's not an answer.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.829
And I don't remember inviting you.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.953
You don't want me here?

04:36.080 --> 04:39.630
Left you where you were safe, Lyra,
at Jordan College.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.550
Whatever you've brought me...

04:43.680 --> 04:44.795
...] hope it was worth it.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.638
Now, what is it?

04:48.840 --> 04:50.638
I'll tell you...

04:50.760 --> 04:53.195
...if you tell me why you...

04:54.720 --> 04:56.552
...why you lied to me
about being my father.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.791
I would have been so proud.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.672
Why would you have been proud?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.309
Because you're...

05:17.120 --> 05:18.269
...Lord Asriel.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.233
And you're my father.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.957
Your mother, she...

05:31.000 --> 05:32.479
Do you know who your mother is?

05:32.600 --> 05:36.230
Your choice in women
is almost as bad as your choice in bears.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.160
I don't think we should continue
this conversation.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.873
Why not?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.311
Because it is getting sentimental.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.999
Sentimental?!

05:51.120 --> 05:53.270
And because I wouldn't like to.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.994
Are you crying? It's unnecessary.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.430
Lyra Belacqua, you are stronger than that.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.513
It's Silvertongue now.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.075
You don't want my name?

06:04.200 --> 06:06.316
Silvertongue feels like /my name.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.000
It was given to me
by someone who actually loves me,

06:09.120 --> 06:10.758
which is better than I can say for you.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.438
This is why I'm here.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.349
I brought you this and I saved Roger
and now I'll be on my way.

I didn't say that.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.680
Hm.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.918
I looked after this.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.389
All the way from Jordan College!

Fought the Magisterium,
enlisted the witches, fought the bears,

07:10.960 --> 07:12.314

07:12.440 --> 07:13.635
and you refuse it?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.276
Call yourself a father?

07:19.240 --> 07:21.197
I think that's rather the point.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.120
I've never called myself a father.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.157
I wouldn't be so arrogant
as to claim that.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.760
Hopefully, we shall prove fast enough.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.589
However fast we go,
Asriel will be waiting.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.195
We have firepower and belief.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.470
Two mighty weapons.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.797
All he has is his own distorted arrogance.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.751
And his work.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.039
Work you don't want others to see, but...

08:40.159 --> 08:43.152
...you really don't want
to see it yourself.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.629
You want to see it?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.874
I'm not frightened of it.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.879
What did he do to you?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.879
What power he still exerts!

08:59.000 --> 09:00.399
You know nothing.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.710
I knew you.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.116
An ambitious young woman
with a good marriage,

09:06.240 --> 09:07.799
well on her way to quite some position,

09:07.920 --> 09:09.672
and then that man came along and you...

09:09.800 --> 09:12.758
- ...melted in front of...
- I did not melt.

09:13.960 --> 09:19.194
You don't even claim responsibility
for your child.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.279
Hm.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.313
I suppose you consider yourself
without sin.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.636
No-one can claim to be without sin.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.952
So what is your sin...

Hm?

09:42.360 --> 09:43.589

09:45.800 --> 09:47.199
Greed?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.399
No.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.113
It's envy.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.109
You want what Asriel and I have.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.231
A sureness of step, a conviction,

10:06.360 --> 10:08.920
but you...you lack it.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.317
I'm the best weapon you'll ever have.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.233
Has it given you an answer?

10:14.360 --> 10:16.397
An alethiometer gives you
the answer you need,

10:16.520 --> 10:17.510
not necessarily the answer you desire.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.078
Not necessarily the answer you desire.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.589
- Sometimes it's more of a riddle than...
- What did it say?

10:21.880 --> 10:25.874
The question I posed, very precisely,
is, "What did Grumman discover?"

10:26.000 --> 10:27.638
What did the damn thing say?

10:27.760 --> 10:28.830
It said...

10:28.960 --> 10:32.635
...there's a knife in a tower
surrounded by angels.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.478
That's what he has discovered.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.874
And?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.640
His son will lead you to it.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.195
But Grumman never married,
never had a son.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.880
So I may need to ask
another question, or...

10:47.920 --> 10:49.149
A son?

10:51.440 --> 10:52.760
You're sure it said a son?

10:52.880 --> 10:54.871
For that part,
it gave me the levels of the baby,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.798
the angel and the marionette symbols.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.150
The answer was quite categorical.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.510

Tell me, sir,

11:32.480 --> 11:35.711

- A brush for her teeth, for instance.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.274
Does she have a toothbrush?

11:39.680 --> 11:41.000
I wouldn't be overly concerned.

11:41.120 --> 11:45.557
Now that Iofur's dead, there will be
an airship of soldiers on their way here.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.513
But the Magisterium won't be
our only enemies for much longer.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.359
You've found a bigger enemy?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.959
The enemy.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.075
And now that Iofur's guards are gone,
I'm free to go after it.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.273
I'm afraid I won't be here
when the Magisterium arrives.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.391
I'm going to ask you
to make sure that Lyra is safe.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.514
After all this time,
you don't want me with you?

12:14.640 --> 12:16.995
It's not that. I need you here.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.800
I'm asking you to protect my daughter.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.957

No. No, I have work.

To say. Why are you in the bathroom?

13:53.360 --> 13:54.430
Oh.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.114
I just got spooked.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.833
By what?

13:58.960 --> 14:02.476
By your father. What's he doing here?

14:04.280 --> 14:06.271
He looked at you really angrily,

14:06.400 --> 14:10.314
and then he saw me
and he calmed down immediately.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.831
He looked at me
like he was a wolf or something.

Not really.

Parents are more trouble
than they're worth.

getting to know mine.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.277
ASRIEL: You once asked me what Dust was.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.316
The truth is, I don't know.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.876
Why is the Magisterium so afraid of it?

20:08.240 --> 20:11.437
They're afraid of it
because they think it is sin.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.312
Actual physical sin.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.473
Raining down from the sky,
settling on humanity

20:17.600 --> 20:20.831
and infecting our souls with evil.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.758
To be fair, it's a terrifying thought.

20:24.720 --> 20:28.839
For the longest time,
the Magisterium completely ignored Dust.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.189
But then it was discovered

20:30.320 --> 20:34.154
that Dust only begins to settle
on humans going through puberty.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.351
The connection was made to Adam and Eve...

20:37.800 --> 20:40.599
...and they labelled Dust as original sin.

20:41.760 --> 20:42.750
Original sin?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.191
When did Eve's daemon settle?

20:47.320 --> 20:50.392
When Eve ate the apple,
like the serpent told her to.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.794
Well done.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.513
And the serpent said,

20:53.640 --> 20:55.472
"You shall not surely die,

20:55.600 --> 20:59.514
"for the Authority doth know
that on that day that ye eat thereof,

20:59.640 --> 21:02.439
"your eyes shall be opened,

21:02.560 --> 21:05.632
"your daemons shall assume their true form
and ye shall be as..."

21:05.760 --> 21:07.433
BOTH: "...gods, knowing good and..."

21:07.560 --> 21:09.995
-"...evil."
- "...Dust."

21:13.960 --> 21:15.394
You see?

21:17.840 --> 21:22.516
They have been trying to convince us
for centuries that we are born guilty.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.999
And that we have to spend a lifetime
atoning for the crime of eating an apple.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.315
Is there any proof for this heinous stain,

21:33.440 --> 21:34.760
this shame, this guilt?

21:34.880 --> 21:35.836
No, not at all.

21:35.960 --> 21:40.670
We are to take it on faith,
and on the word of the Authority.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.514
But Dust...

21:43.640 --> 21:48.953
Dust is an elementary particle
that we can record, measure, study.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.514
We can take photograms of it.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.199
And it has given them what they need -

21:52.320 --> 21:54.755
a means by which to control, to oppress,

21:54.880 --> 21:57.554
to frighten,
and to keep us where they want us -

21:57.680 --> 21:59.079
on our knees.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.191
That's what my mother
thinks she's doing...

22:02.440 --> 22:04.113
...cutting away our daemons.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.871
Preserving our sinless souls.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.712
You should have seen them.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.116
Those who had their daemons cut away.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.879
They looked empty.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.435
Did they try to cut you, Lyra?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.310
She stopped them.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.350
Your mother stopped them?

22:44.920 --> 22:46.831
She didn't want to damage me.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.156
Happy to damage others.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.953
Is that a fact?

22:54.600 --> 22:56.273
The thought of Pan being cut from me...

22:56.400 --> 22:57.959
(PAN SCRATCHES)

23:00.560 --> 23:02.198
(WHIMPERS QUIETLY)

23:04.320 --> 23:05.719

23:12.160 --> 23:15.676

is incredibly powerful.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.356
Quite beautiful, really.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.557
There's actually
an immense release of energy...

23:23.960 --> 23:25.553
...when that link is severed.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.796
What is the most important question
we can ask?

23:32.880 --> 23:34.279
Where Dust comes from.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.154
There you are.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.752
- The photograms you took...
- The aurora.

23:46.880 --> 23:50.999
You've seen Dust pouring
into this world from the aurora.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.192
If light can cross that barrier
between the universes,

23:54.320 --> 23:55.515
if Dust can,

23:55.640 --> 23:58.359
if we can see that city up there
in the sky,

23:58.480 --> 24:00.596
then we can build a bridge
and we can cross.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.791
- Cross to multiple worlds?
- Why not?

24:02.920 --> 24:05.196
Let's go to the source,
let's ask what Dust is.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.197
Maybe we'll find out
that it's something else entirely.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.674
Maybe we'll find out that it ls sin.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.996
How do you like the sound of that?

24:11.120 --> 24:12.349
I... I don't know.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.639
What I do know is I've done my piece.

24:19.800 --> 24:25.159
Lyra, what I can tell you is that Dust
is what makes the alethiometer work.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.520
Did you know that?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.359
I doubt the Magisterium know that.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.079
It works through Dust?

24:35.600 --> 24:38.831
I brought you the alethiometer
and now I just need to take Roger home.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.078
Did the Master ever actually ask you
to bring it to me?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.552
It's yours.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.000
You were never sent to me at all.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.958
But I am glad you came.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.918
You don't come from nothing, Lyra.

Oh, I am pleased that you came, Marisa,

43:37.200 --> 43:38.713
to see what I've done.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.878
The Magisterium will never allow it.

Then leave the Magisterium.

Come with me, and we will change them all.

But our child is in this world.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.758
And my place is with her.
