00:02.327 --> 00:04.429
IZZY'S LUNCH.
HENRY'S LUNCH.

00:04.429 --> 00:06.064
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

00:06.064 --> 00:08.934
EVERY HINT I'VE GIVEN
SINCE YOU MOVED IN.

00:11.236 --> 00:14.039
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO SUBTLE.

00:14.039 --> 00:17.275
[Slowly]
MOVE OUT.

00:17.275 --> 00:20.111
WHAT'S HE REALLY
TRYING TO SAY?

00:20.111 --> 00:24.049
HEY, CRIS, WHAT ARE THREE THINGS
THAT YOU COULDN'T DO WITHOUT?

00:24.049 --> 00:26.551
UH, AIR, WATER, AND...

00:26.551 --> 00:27.686
FAMILY?

00:27.686 --> 00:30.121
[LAUGHS] NO.

00:30.121 --> 00:31.957
UH, FOOTBALL.

00:31.957 --> 00:33.625
HEY, QUÃ© PASA, EVERYBODY!

00:33.625 --> 00:35.427
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE
YOUR DOOR OPEN LIKE THAT.

00:35.427 --> 00:37.062
SOMEONE COULD JUST
WALK IN AND TAKE YOUR STUFF.

00:37.062 --> 00:38.363
THANKS.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.001
THAT WAS MINE!

00:43.001 --> 00:43.969
OH, COME ON.

00:43.969 --> 00:46.004
ALL THIS FOR
A DAINTY FLOWER LIKE YOU?

00:48.707 --> 00:50.075
OKAY.

00:50.075 --> 00:53.211
AND THAT, FELIX, IS HOW
YOU ALMOST CHARM A WOMAN.

00:53.211 --> 00:57.082
HEY, CRIS, ARE YOU MORE OF
A DOG PERSON OR A CAT PERSON?

00:57.082 --> 00:59.184
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
ALL THESE WEIRD QUESTIONS?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.619
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'VE BEEN WORRIED

01:00.619 --> 01:02.020
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT DATING ENOUGH?

01:02.020 --> 01:04.055
UH, NO?

01:05.390 --> 01:07.659
WELL, <i>WE</i> ARE, SO...

01:07.659 --> 01:09.494
I'M SIGNING YOU UP
FOR A DATING SITE.

01:09.494 --> 01:11.162
OH, THAT'S A DUMB IDEA.

01:11.162 --> 01:13.565
IT WAS MINE.

01:13.565 --> 01:15.634
THAT EXPLAINS IT.

01:15.634 --> 01:18.570
LOOK, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN DATING ANYONE.

01:18.570 --> 01:21.339
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
FOR YOU, CRISTELA.

01:21.339 --> 01:24.142
WHEN DANIELA WAS YOUR AGE,
SHE ALREADY HAD TWO KIDS.

01:24.142 --> 01:25.343
MM-HMM.

01:25.343 --> 01:29.314
YEAH, MA, 'CAUSE GUYS
LOVE PREGNANT CHICKS.

01:29.314 --> 01:31.516
SOME DON'T MIND.
[LAUGHS]

01:34.953 --> 01:37.122
MY MOTHER
GOT MARRIED AT 15.

01:37.122 --> 01:38.623
I GOT MARRIED AT 17.

01:38.623 --> 01:41.960
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE
LIKE YOUR AUNT SOCORRO,

01:41.960 --> 01:44.029
A SPINSTER
WHO DIED ALONE.

01:44.029 --> 01:45.597
SHE WAS 18!

01:47.165 --> 01:49.034
STILL -- ALONE!

01:50.335 --> 01:52.404
HEY, WHAT GRADE DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY YOU COMPLETED?

01:52.404 --> 01:56.341
OH, UH, PUT DOWN HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT THAT SHE STRUGGLED.

01:57.976 --> 01:59.578
I'M IN LAW SCHOOL.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.580
MEN DON'T LIKE WOMEN
WHO ARE SMARTER THAN THEM.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.981
AND, DANIELA,

02:02.981 --> 02:07.052
YOU COULD, UH, MISSPELL A FEW
THINGS IN THERE, TOO, HUH?

02:08.019 --> 02:09.487
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

02:09.487 --> 02:11.690
I ACTUALLY LIKE A WOMAN WHO CAN
CHALLENGE ME INTELLECTUALLY.

02:11.690 --> 02:14.259
THEN YOU'RE LUCKY,
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL WOMEN.

02:27.205 --> 02:29.541
WHY WOULD ANYBODY
NEED TO MEET A GUY ONLINE?

02:29.541 --> 02:32.177
I MEAN, YOU JUST GO TO A BAR,
DON'T ORDER A DRINK,

02:32.177 --> 02:35.513
AND TWO SECONDS LATER,
SOMEONE BUYS YOU ONE, YOU KNOW?

02:37.549 --> 02:40.085
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW MUCH A DRINK COSTS?

02:40.085 --> 02:41.519
$80?

02:43.421 --> 02:45.256
MY SISTER
SAYS ONLINE DATING

02:45.256 --> 02:47.926
IS FOR PEOPLE THAT
DON'T CARE ABOUT LOOKS.

02:47.926 --> 02:49.594
MM, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

02:49.594 --> 02:51.496
I DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE
ON LOOKS.

02:51.496 --> 02:52.931
I JUDGE PEOPLE ON MONEY.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.302
I NEED TWO INTERNS
TO ORGANIZE THESE BRIEFS,

02:57.302 --> 02:59.204
AND I NEED THEM
TO BE PERFECT.

02:59.204 --> 03:02.707
IS THAT YOUR WAY
OF SAYING "NOT ME," DADDY?

03:02.707 --> 03:04.175
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL,
SWEETHEART.

03:04.175 --> 03:05.010
OH. [CHUCKLES]

03:05.010 --> 03:07.245
WHERE'S JOSH?

03:07.245 --> 03:08.179
RIGHT HERE, SIR.

03:08.179 --> 03:09.114
OH.

03:09.114 --> 03:10.015
I NEED THESE BY FRIDAY.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.117
OH, PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S
THE HANLEY LITIGATION.

03:12.117 --> 03:13.985
YOU KNOW, I HAD
A DREAM LAST NIGHT

03:13.985 --> 03:16.321
WHERE I WAS ALPHABETIZING
ALL THE FILES.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.990
I DREAMED WE NEVER HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.061
BUT TODAY'S
YOUR LUCKY DAY, JOSH.

03:23.061 --> 03:23.528
YEAH.

03:23.528 --> 03:24.663
IT REALLY IS, SIR. YES.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.631
SOMEONE'S BUYING THEMSELVES
DINNER TONIGHT.

03:26.631 --> 03:28.199
THAT'S GREAT.
TOO MUCH SHARING.

03:31.069 --> 03:35.273
SO, JOSH, CRISTELA DOESN'T
WANT TO TRY ONLINE DATING.

03:35.273 --> 03:39.444
I, UH, I THINK IT'S A...
cultural thing.

03:39.444 --> 03:43.181
Even though I'm Mexican,
I can still hear you!

03:45.050 --> 03:48.486
UH, I'M JUST TOO BUSY
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

03:48.486 --> 03:51.389
WHAT? I DO THE SAME STUFF
AS YOU, AND I HAVE TIME.

03:51.389 --> 03:53.324
I WORK LAWYER'S HOURS.

03:53.324 --> 03:54.259
MM-HMM.

03:54.259 --> 03:56.194
YOU WORK LAWYER'S
DAUGHTER'S HOURS.

03:57.929 --> 03:59.664
WELL, I LIKE MINE BETTER.

04:00.932 --> 04:03.101
HEY, I TOTALLY GET IT.
I DON'T DATE.

04:03.101 --> 04:04.936
IT'S NOT PART OF
MY 10-YEAR-PLAN.

04:04.936 --> 04:06.971
<i>YOU</i> HAVE A 10-YEAR-PLAN?
<i>I</i> HAVE A 10-YEAR-PLAN.

04:06.971 --> 04:07.939
GET OUT OF HERE.

04:07.939 --> 04:09.374
I STARTED MINE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.010
OH, YOU STARTED LATE.
I STARTED MINE IN JUNIOR HIGH.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.045
OKAY. STOP BRAGGING.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.714
[CHUCKLES] I WANTED TO
GO TO NYU FOR UNDERGRAD

04:15.714 --> 04:16.981
AND NAILED THAT.

04:16.981 --> 04:18.950
UH, WHEN TO U.T.,
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.618
I GOT INTO SMU LAW,
AS PLANNED.

04:20.618 --> 04:22.620
ME, TOO, BUT WAIT -- WHY
LEAVE NEW YORK FOR TEXAS?

04:22.620 --> 04:25.957
I WANTED TO GO
SOMEWHERE EXOTIC.

04:25.957 --> 04:27.625
NOW I HAVE TO MAKE ASSOCIATE
IN FIVE YEARS.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.627
UH, DUH, 'CAUSE HOW ARE YOU
GONNA MAKE PARTNER IN 12?

04:29.627 --> 04:31.563
WELL, SEE, NOW WE'RE REALLY
GETTING INTO MY 20-YEAR-PLAN.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.565
OKAY, I'LL GO THERE
WITH YOU.
YEAH? ALL RIGHT.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.366
WELL, SO, I WANT TO TRY
A SUPREME COURT CASE
BY THE TIME I'M 50.

04:35.366 --> 04:38.103
HMM. AND RETIRE AT 65
TO RUN A NONPROFIT

04:38.103 --> 04:39.304
FOR LATINO IMMIGRANTS.

04:39.304 --> 04:42.340
I WAS GONNA SAY
UNDERPRIVILEGED JEWISH KIDS.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.412
IS THAT EVEN A THING?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.348
IT'S SO CRAZY.

04:50.348 --> 04:51.983
IT'S LIKE WE SHOULD
BE DIFFERENT,

04:51.983 --> 04:54.152
BUT WE'RE BOTH FOCUSED ON
THE SAME THING.

04:54.152 --> 04:55.286
YEAH,
WITH OUR SCHEDULES,

04:55.286 --> 04:57.021
WE'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO
MEET PEOPLE WE WORK WITH.

05:01.993 --> 05:04.329
YOU KNOW, I SEE WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS, JOSH,

05:04.329 --> 05:06.564
AND YOU'RE SWEET,
BUT I'M NOT GOING OUT WITH YOU.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.072
[DOOR OPENS]

05:14.072 --> 05:16.574
OH, YOU'RE HERE. GOOD.

05:16.574 --> 05:19.544
OKAY, SO TODAY,
I LAID A 12x12 FLOOR

05:19.544 --> 05:22.046
AND DID NOT BEND ONE NAIL.

05:25.583 --> 05:28.319
OKAY, I WASN'T EXPECTING
AN APPLAUSE, BUT, YOU KNOW,

05:28.319 --> 05:30.955
THESE LITTLE CONTESTS
GET ME THROUGH THE DAY.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.190
LISTEN TO THIS.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.559
IT'S A QUOTE FROM
ONE OF CRISTELA'S MATCHES.

05:34.559 --> 05:38.096
"LOVE IS
AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE

05:38.096 --> 05:41.032
TO BE
IRRESISTIBLY DESIRED."

05:43.168 --> 05:45.703
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

05:45.703 --> 05:47.505
[SCOFFS]

05:47.505 --> 05:50.708
HE JUST RHYMED
"DESIRE" WITH "DESIRED."

05:50.708 --> 05:55.547
ENGLISH IS MY SECOND LANGUAGE,
BUT EVEN I KNOW THAT SUCKED.

05:58.183 --> 06:01.085
HOW COME YOU'VE NEVER
WRITTEN ME A POEM?

06:01.085 --> 06:04.422
THAT NEW TILE IN YOUR BATHROOM
IS MY POEM TO YOU.

06:05.123 --> 06:06.724
I JUST GET A LITTLE JEALOUS

06:06.724 --> 06:09.928
WHEN I READ THESE MEN
TELL CRISTELA HOW FASCINATING

06:09.928 --> 06:11.095
THEY THINK SHE IS.

06:11.095 --> 06:12.530
WELL, YOU KNOW WHY
THEY THINK THAT?

06:12.530 --> 06:14.098
THEY HAVEN'T MET HER.

06:15.967 --> 06:19.337
NO. THEY THINK THAT
BECAUSE <i>THEY'RE</i> SENSITIVE.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.207
[SCOFFS]
<i>I'M</i> SENSITIVE.

06:22.207 --> 06:26.177
I CRIED A LITTLE WHEN
I FINISHED YOUR TILES.

06:27.245 --> 06:30.481
MAYBE YOU GOT GROUT
IN YOUR EYE.

06:30.481 --> 06:33.184
WELL, THE POINT
IS I CRIED, RIGHT?

06:33.184 --> 06:36.020
YOU'RE NOT SENSITIVE.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.123
COME ON.

06:39.123 --> 06:40.325
IS THAT A NEW BLOUSE?

06:40.325 --> 06:42.260
NO.

06:43.995 --> 06:45.096
NO.

06:46.397 --> 06:48.600
YOU'RE NOT SENSITIVE.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.635
I LOVE YOU.

06:50.635 --> 06:53.338
AND I LOVE YOU,
TOO!

06:53.338 --> 06:55.073
UGH.

06:55.073 --> 06:59.344
COULD THIS PERSONAL-RECORD DAY
GET ANY WORSE?

06:59.344 --> 07:02.247
OKAY, CRIS,
DON'T BE MAD,

07:02.247 --> 07:05.216
BUT I WENT AHEAD AND SUBMITTED
YOUR PROFILE TO THE DATING SITE.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.985
THAT'S NICE.

07:06.985 --> 07:09.254
LET ME KNOW HOW MY DATES GO.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.061
AND THAT WAS JUST
DURING THE DAY.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.063
THINK HOW MUCH MORE
YOU COULD GET

07:19.063 --> 07:20.965
WHEN THE GUYS WITH JOBS
GET ONLINE.

07:22.967 --> 07:25.036
YOU WON'T HAVE TO PUT IN
THAT MUCH TIME.

07:25.036 --> 07:26.304
I COULD DO IT FOR YOU.

ANSWERED A FEW.

COMING FROM A GOOD PLACE,

A MAN WOULD HOLD ME BACK.

HELD ME BACK.

07:42.687 --> 07:46.658

ON FOOD STAMPS

AY, MEMORIES.

ANY OF THOSE GUYS

07:58.469 --> 08:01.673
WOULD FIT IN
WITH MY LIFESTYLE, OKAY?

08:01.673 --> 08:03.341
YOU SLEEP AND YOU WORK.

08:03.341 --> 08:06.010
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT THAT'S NOT A LIFESTYLE.

OH, SOMEONE SENT ME
A MESSAGE THAT SAID "LOL,"

WHAT ABOUT YOUR PLAN?

11:04.522 --> 11:07.992
JOSH, THE PLAN IS FINE.
IT'S JUST AN HOUR FOR DINNER.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.029
DO I DETECT
A LITTLE JEALOUSY?

11:12.029 --> 11:14.465
JEALOUS? NO.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.068
NO, I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR CAREER, IS ALL.

11:35.086 --> 11:37.255
I CAN'T NOT
MAKE A NOISE!

11:37.255 --> 11:39.957
YOU KNOW, MOONING OVER
SOME GUY INSTEAD OF WORKING

11:39.957 --> 11:41.592
IS NOT GONNA HELP YOU
MAKE PARTNER.

11:41.592 --> 11:43.361
I KNOW THAT.

11:43.361 --> 11:45.696
I WAS GOING ON THIS DATE
TO SHUT MY FAMILY UP,

HE SEEMS KIND OF COOL.

ANOTHER GUY WHO LIKES "ROCKY"?

THAT MAYBE I'M
MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING,
