and, seeing as though
I'm the only person

00:15.667 --> 00:19.541
gonna see these videos,
I can admit that I was wrong.

you boys looked good.

I could tell the
coach was impressed.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.763
Thanks, Coach,
but if we want to make it

01:07.806 --> 01:09.634

talking about Simone,

01:28.783 --> 01:30.829
don't worry.

01:30.873 --> 01:33.093
Yeah, I told her
how I felt,

01:33.136 --> 01:34.789
and, yeah, then she
asked for more time,

01:34.833 --> 01:38.489
but whatever she got
going on, I'm good.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.883
-Focused on the future, baby.
-OK.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.450
Hey, speaking
of distractions,

01:42.493 --> 01:45.104
you gonna tell me
what's going on with KEK?

01:45.148 --> 01:47.542
I can tell that something
is going on, J.

Hey, look.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.763
Just tell me that
somebody got you, man.

01:51.807 --> 01:54.723
Yeah, Pops, actually.

01:54.765 --> 01:57.595
I'm meeting with him later

Our probate's not
gonna get canceled.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.132
But Aqueelah said that
there was an issue.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.959
And I trust that she's
gonna work it out.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.961
-We're probating tonight.
-OK.

-For me?
-Don't make this a thing.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.935
I heard from
a little Phoenix

02:32.978 --> 02:34.719
what your
line name is.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.376
It fits.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.422
Cam, this
is really dope.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.601
[Chuckles]

02:46.644 --> 02:48.864
Krenshaw with a "K"
is a great line name.

02:48.906 --> 02:50.779
It reminds you
of where you've been,

02:50.822 --> 02:52.954
and that image fits
who you are now--

02:52.998 --> 02:56.263
noble, selfless,
and fearless,

02:56.305 --> 03:00.136

Do you remember our
first day at the bonfire?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.141
Mm-hmm, and I
was telling you

03:05.185 --> 03:06.795
to keep my business
to yourself

03:06.838 --> 03:08.057
so I could have
a fresh start.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.841
Yes. I remember.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.974
Well, I never thought
my fresh start

03:12.017 --> 03:14.281
would include you.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.370
Aww!

03:16.413 --> 03:18.720
Look at us going from
decent acquaintances

03:18.763 --> 03:21.549
to family in more
ways than one.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.683
So Bringston is sponsoring
the exhibition match.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.859
Different people from HBCUs
have already signed up.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.471
Damn, the exhibition,
the PKZ stuff,

03:30.514 --> 03:32.341
and this internship
with Lando's sister--

03:32.386 --> 03:34.344
you're low-key killing
the game right now.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.867
Well, almost.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.565
I still haven't heard
about the internship.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.219
Ooh, do you think if you
chose Damon over Lando,

03:39.262 --> 03:40.611
you would still get
the internship?

03:40.655 --> 03:41.786
Now, you know
you ain't right.

been walking around all crazy?

a little stressed

election results.

I could've done better" stage.

Damon: Yeah. Come on.
You did the damn thing.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.715
People know
what you stand for.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.544
Lando: And now it's up to the
voters to take what they have

04:00.588 --> 04:02.198
and make a choice.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.939

somebody else I know.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.245

Everyone's confirmed.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.745
Thank you for putting
me in contact

04:27.789 --> 04:30.095
with all the alumni
in New York.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.446
Dr. Pace isn't ready.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.361
Um, I got to go. Yeah.

04:34.404 --> 04:37.755
I'll see you when
you're on campus. Bye.

04:37.799 --> 04:38.930
So I guess you
finally found a way

04:38.974 --> 04:40.758
to get back
at Dr. Pace.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.717
What's
the master plan?

Alumni are supposed
to come speak

04:44.371 --> 04:45.633

04:45.676 --> 04:47.852
but instead of
singing her praises,

they're gonna out her toxic
teaching methods on blast.

has tenure, Cam.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.036

support me in this?

I support you whenever
and how ever you need,

but this
ain't you, Kei.

than this.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.313
The credentials of
some of these therapists

05:13.356 --> 05:14.531

05:14.575 --> 05:15.880
And we haven't
even officially

05:15.924 --> 05:17.229

the wellness center.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.884
This is from H.R.
gauging interest.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.364
My guess is,
they see the kind

05:21.408 --> 05:22.844
of institution
you're building here,

05:22.887 --> 05:24.149
and they want to be
a part of it.

I can't believe
how blessed I am.

fighting to keep my job.

seen myself here.

seen us here.

off-the-record conversation

with the regional
vice president.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.126
From what I hear,
he's a good guy

who's had experience
with these situations.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.827

the frat's divided

06:32.870 --> 06:35.395
on whether or not
the process needs to change.

have to decide

to take this,

that is, I'm with you.

the summer league?

06:51.541 --> 06:53.108
That's easy.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.588
Because I want to play
against the best.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.067
Well, during the preseason,
you de-committed

06:56.111 --> 06:57.721
then committed to
Bringston and Hawkins.

personal stuff going on.

The team coach

07:11.996 --> 07:13.389

if you can handle

07:13.433 --> 07:15.478

from the media.

worked it out.

-Then why did he quit?
-I don't know.

-I didn't ask him about it.
-Well, the interim coach

07:30.232 --> 07:32.147

a full-time contract

mid season
and quits, right?

07:34.323 --> 07:36.543
You didn't think
to ask him why.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.545
Is it because
he's a bad coach

07:38.588 --> 07:40.155
or a bad father?

07:40.198 --> 07:42.157
You know what?
I'm out.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.028
-I don't need this.
-Damon, we're not finished.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.509
No. Look. I don't
care what you say.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.946
Come on. A real interview
wouldn't do all of this.

throwing my mistakes

Dr. Patterson
and I tried,

08:38.212 --> 08:40.215
but the trustees
wouldn't go for it.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.869
I'm sorry, but we're

08:41.912 --> 08:43.479
gonna have to cancel
the exhibition match.

08:52.706 --> 08:53.837
Simone, hold up.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.230
Hey, Lando. Sorry.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.579
What's going on?

08:56.623 --> 08:58.015
The exhibition match
will be canceled

08:58.059 --> 08:59.800
if I don't raise
some more money.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.497
It's over.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.238
That's not the
Simone Hicks I know.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.849
Well, I can't raise thousands
of dollars in two hours.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.808
You're the person
who always finds a way.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.158
It's one of the things
I love about you.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.293
Look. Your anger
and your frustration

09:15.337 --> 09:16.643
is keeping you from
seeing the options

09:16.686 --> 09:18.035
right
in front of you.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.820
PKZ.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.257
I have hundreds of
powerful Black women

09:22.300 --> 09:23.606
as my sisters now,
so maybe

09:23.650 --> 09:25.216
one of them
can help sponsor.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.478
Charlotte has
never had a problem

09:26.522 --> 09:28.176
PKZ couldn't
help her with.

09:28.219 --> 09:31.135
Thank you.
I got to go.

09:32.441 --> 09:33.964
Ryan: Congratulations,
President Hardin.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.705
Well, thank you,
Reporter Ryan Craig.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.228
The paper does
a photo shoot

09:37.272 --> 09:38.839
and interview with
the new president

09:38.882 --> 09:40.188
to re-introduce them
to the entire campus,

09:40.231 --> 09:41.668
so I was wondering--

09:41.711 --> 09:43.234
Oh, you had me
at "photo shoot."

09:43.278 --> 09:44.671
When and where
do I strike a pose,

09:44.714 --> 09:46.237
right here?

09:46.281 --> 09:48.065
Keisha: You are literally
always ready.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.199
Go to this website and
pick a date and time.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.330
I'll see you then.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.202
I'll see you then.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.508
Girl, did you
see his pen?

09:56.552 --> 09:58.423
It looks exactly
like the one

09:58.467 --> 10:00.643
your secret admirer dropped
at the masquerade ball.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.253
Didn't you say
the initials were R.C.?

10:02.297 --> 10:03.951
And you think they
stand for "Ryan Craig"?

10:03.994 --> 10:05.169
Girl, no.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.475
He doesn't
really seem like

10:06.518 --> 10:08.346
the grand, romantic
gesture type.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.522
Nate, how many college
students do you know

10:10.566 --> 10:12.916
walk around with pens
that look like that?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.657
Woman: Why in he world
you would rather be here than--

10:14.701 --> 10:16.920
This is a celebration
of my career.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.356
You shouldn't
be here.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.011
Oh! Ha!
Oh, Dorothea...

10:21.055 --> 10:23.013
that's a lie.

10:23.057 --> 10:27.452
You owe your career,
such as it is, to me.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.978
If I'm such
a disappointment,

10:31.021 --> 10:32.675
why come?

10:32.719 --> 10:36.679
I wanted to see how far
you had fallen for myself.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.594
Nate: Who do you
think that woman is?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.466
She sure got
Dr. Pace all shook.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.121
[Ding]

10:44.165 --> 10:45.645
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.385
I got your text about
hitting up KEK alums.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.344
The exhibition match
is in danger

10:49.387 --> 10:51.433
of not happening unless
we raise some money,

10:51.476 --> 10:54.218
so I reached out
to PKZ alums.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.480
In hopes one of them
might have

10:55.524 --> 10:57.004
a last-minute lead
for a sponsor?

10:57.047 --> 10:58.745
-Yeah.
-That's a smart plan.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.921
Thanks.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.010
J.R.: What's up, bro?
How was your mock interview?

11:03.053 --> 11:04.707
Messed up.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.188
Coach Marcus was way
out of pocket, bro.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.624
What happened?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.321
Coach was asking me
personal questions

11:10.365 --> 11:11.888
about me
and Jessie, bro.

11:11.932 --> 11:15.022
OK. He was asking me
personal questions, too.

11:15.065 --> 11:17.372
For me, aplastic anemia
was on the menu.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.939
And that's not
messed up to you?

11:18.982 --> 11:20.505
Uh-uh.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.203
Bro, some things should
just be off limits.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.553
But he's just preparing
us for the real world.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.207
Look. It's some
folks out there

11:26.250 --> 11:28.122
don't give a crap
about our boundaries.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.167
It's strength in
being an open book.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.691
Just look at Coach.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.562
If we learn to be
more like him,

11:33.605 --> 11:34.911
there's no question
from our past

11:34.955 --> 11:36.130
that we won't
be ready for.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.306

see y'all later.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.527
Yeah.

11:46.401 --> 11:49.534
Yo, do you
agree with that?

11:51.362 --> 11:54.148
Honestly,
I don't think

11:54.191 --> 11:56.280
you're mad
at Coach Marcus.

11:56.324 --> 11:59.196
What I'm getting
is fear, not anger.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.589
I get it.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.156
When you start
speaking your truth,

12:02.199 --> 12:04.462
it leaves a door open
for people to judge you,

12:04.506 --> 12:07.030
but, Damon, you don't
have to be ashamed.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.945
Everyone
has family drama,

12:08.989 --> 12:10.686
and I don't know
who's interviewing you,

12:10.730 --> 12:14.168
but their focus is gonna
be that you personally,

12:14.211 --> 12:16.431
you bring a lot
to the table.

12:16.474 --> 12:22.089
You're kind,
thoughtful, strong...

12:22.132 --> 12:25.005
and even when you're
being annoyingly arrogant,

12:25.048 --> 12:27.703
it's inspiring.

[Cell phone chimes]

12:31.576 --> 12:33.013

12:33.056 --> 12:34.928
OK. Clearly, something
dope just happened.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.931
-You want to share it?
-Sorry.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.410
So I think
I just found a way

12:39.454 --> 12:41.108
to save
the exhibition match.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.544
J.R.: Gentlemen,
got called

12:42.587 --> 12:44.459
into President
Patterson's office.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.591
There's been a accusation
of hazing in our chapter.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.115
So what happens now?

12:48.158 --> 12:49.464
Bringston
and KEK leadership

12:49.507 --> 12:51.074
is launching a full-on
investigation.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.641
Lou: And if we're
found guilty?

12:52.684 --> 12:54.512
Usually, the chapter
gets expelled

12:54.556 --> 12:56.253
from campus
indefinitely.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.342
I just wanted Terrell
to be held accountable.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.388
I was really trying
to avoid this.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.738
But who snitched?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.436
Terrell: Y'all should
lock y'all doors.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.525
You never know who
gonna stroll in.

we in the middle of something.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.137
Oh, I hear,

13:10.180 --> 13:12.052
a hazing
investigation.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.444
That can really put
a stain on this chapter

13:13.488 --> 13:14.837
y'all may never
recover from.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.100
So snitching
is your thing now?

13:17.144 --> 13:19.711
You know your involvement
in this is gonna come out,

13:19.755 --> 13:21.713
and your letters
is gonna be taken.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.890
See, I'm not
worried about that.

13:23.933 --> 13:27.023
See, the regional VP,
he's, uh--he's,
like, my uncle.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.069
So when my dad called
to set up the meeting,

13:29.112 --> 13:31.680
the regional VP
called you.

13:31.723 --> 13:32.942
Bingo.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.336
Oh, ho ho. Look.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.555
You should've
let this go.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.080
Now your whole
chapter gonna suffer,

13:40.123 --> 13:43.126
all because of you.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.872

with the PKZ alum.

13:49.915 --> 13:52.701
They know someone at the
Southern Women's Tennis League.

13:52.744 --> 13:55.051
She followed our situation,
and she's offered

13:55.095 --> 13:57.837
to sponsor our
exhibition match.

-Oh!
-Congratulations.

supposed to be tonight.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.165

got leaked,

to be super secret,

to move it to tomorrow...

Well, the probate wouldn't
be the same without you,

14:57.244 --> 14:59.463
there is no probate
without you.

17:59.817 --> 18:02.298
I saw Dr. Pace
get demoralized

18:02.342 --> 18:05.736
by an older woman
yesterday.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.825
I've never really seen her
that crushed before.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.305
Who was she?

18:09.349 --> 18:11.394
Her former
dance teacher.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.135
Apparently, she's
a real piece of work.

18:13.179 --> 18:17.748
She's supposedly
more toxic than Dr. Pace.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.838
I brought her former
dance teacher to Bringston

18:20.882 --> 18:22.449
because I knew that
it would shake her...

18:22.492 --> 18:23.928
Keisha, you didn't.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.757
and I put together
a plan to humiliate her

18:26.801 --> 18:28.585
at the celebration
of her career.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.239
I know, I know.

18:30.283 --> 18:33.199
It's--it's too far,
and Cam tried to stop me,

18:33.242 --> 18:36.332
but I've just been really
blinded by my own hurt.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.030
-You need to stop it.
-I've tried.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.815
Everyone's already
committed to the plan.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.512
There's nothing
that I can do.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.732
If there's time,
there's a way.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.603
Make this right,
Keisha,

18:46.647 --> 18:50.129
for Dr. Pace's sake
and your own.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.395
Damon:
What's good, Lando?

18:55.438 --> 18:57.397
Transparency.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.964
Transparency
is what's good.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.271
OK,

19:02.315 --> 19:05.927
so your feelings for
Simone are serious,

19:05.970 --> 19:09.104
and I'm guessing
that you told her that.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.891
I just wanted to be
honest with you about it.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.552
-Ha ha ha!
-Oh, you--oh.

thinking about boys

should be basking

accomplished today.

Now, why
can't I do both?

19:39.221 --> 19:40.918
OK. Listen.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.007
I get there's some epic
love-triangle decision

19:43.051 --> 19:44.574
that needs to be made,

19:44.618 --> 19:46.707
but this--this is
getting ridiculous,

19:46.750 --> 19:49.492
so let me, um--let me
make this a little
easier for you.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.929
You've only kissed one
and slept with the other,

19:51.973 --> 19:53.540
so you might as well
pick the one

19:53.583 --> 19:55.150
that you haven't
slept with

19:55.194 --> 19:56.630

a whole new adventure.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.197

kissed the one

20:05.595 --> 20:07.336

the other, right?

20:09.860 --> 20:12.298

that I haven't told you

23:06.297 --> 23:08.996

23:10.301 --> 23:13.522
I brought your former
dance teacher to Bringston,

23:13.566 --> 23:15.219
and I know that
she made you suffer

23:15.263 --> 23:17.613
while you were
her student.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.137
But to what end,
my dear?

23:20.181 --> 23:21.835
I wanted you to see
that you're continuing

23:21.878 --> 23:25.665
the cycle of abuse
that you endured.

23:25.708 --> 23:28.450
What you call abuse is
me training me students

23:28.494 --> 23:30.147
to be resilient.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.498
Clearly, you don't keep up
with any of your students.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.892
Yeah, they shine
for a couple of years,

23:35.936 --> 23:38.765
but then most of them
crash and burn

23:38.808 --> 23:40.506
because the toll
it takes on their body

23:40.549 --> 23:42.464

is just too much.

themself back up.

to break the cycle

that you caused them.

I spearheaded this,

wanted to let you know

24:48.225 --> 24:49.488

that'll be the part

Look. I know it's your
job to ask questions,

something first,

32:31.340 --> 32:33.081
if you don't mind.

32:34.517 --> 32:37.129
I've always thought of
myself as an open book,

32:37.172 --> 32:39.131
but until I came
to Bringston,

32:39.174 --> 32:41.263
those pages were blank

because I had questions
about where I came from.

those pages,

32:47.226 --> 32:50.142

32:50.185 --> 32:53.232
are some of them
painful to read,

32:53.275 --> 32:56.017
but they're my story,
and they're filled

32:56.061 --> 32:58.977
with people who are
human, flawed,

32:59.020 --> 33:01.196
complicated,
and that's OK.

with all of it,

up there on that mound,

a look at my stats,

behind the numbers.

share none of it...

to celebrate me and my career,

that I need to take a step back

in this lifetime.

an indefinite sabbatical
