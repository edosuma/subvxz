18:55.267 --> 18:57.302
Fuck.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.304
♪ It's raining men. ♪

18:59.938 --> 19:02.140
[Nehemiah] It's between
Laterrian and Steve.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.743
And now I have someone
who I'm rooming with

19:04.743 --> 19:06.645
and who I am working with,
to win.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.114
This might be
the perfect opportunity

19:09.114 --> 19:11.450
to put one of the strong players

19:11.450 --> 19:14.219
who have avoided elimination,
in.

19:14.219 --> 19:17.856
[TJ] Now you need to be smart,
strong and fast

19:17.856 --> 19:19.491
to be the best in this game.

19:19.491 --> 19:23.195
Name the ten fastest
land animals.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.930
-Steve.
-Cheetah.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.833
-[TJ] Steve, coming through.
-You took mine.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.002
Laterrian.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.771
[tense music playing]

19:35.274 --> 19:36.708
Zebra.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.478
I'm sorry,
zebra didn't make the list.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.549
-[grunts]
-[laughter]

19:43.549 --> 19:45.551
-Steve!
-Way to go, Steve-o.

19:45.551 --> 19:46.818
[Teck]
The Flyin' Hawaiian!

19:46.818 --> 19:48.020
-The Flyin' Hawaiian!
-[TJ] Steve!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.021
[Nehemiah]
There you go, baby.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.455
[applause]

19:50.455 --> 19:52.858
[Casey] Steve wins
and I'm really excited

19:52.858 --> 19:55.460
that we get to nominate
people together.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.130
We can really do
some damage here.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.398
Congratulations, Steve.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.300
-Good job.
-[cheering]

20:01.300 --> 20:02.734
I knew I was gonna be
on the chopping block

20:02.734 --> 20:04.670
if I didn't win,
so, I had to win.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.473
Look at us going from
chopping block to champions.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.577
All right, everyone,
great challenge today.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.212
[applause]

20:14.212 --> 20:16.982
Katie and Brad, first out.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.751
Katie, you didn't even give it
a shot, very disappointed.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.086
-I know.
-[TJ] However...

20:21.086 --> 20:23.622
maybe someday,
you will overcome it.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.157
Not likely.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.427
So I will be seeing
both of you in the Arena.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.997
Brad and Katie are, like,
perfectly fine in this game

20:31.997 --> 20:34.266
because of the way
they politically play their game

20:34.266 --> 20:35.667
and socially,

20:35.667 --> 20:38.136
so the fact
that they are the ones

20:38.136 --> 20:40.072
who are going in is crazy.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.541
Steve, well done.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.544
[applause]

20:45.544 --> 20:47.713
Casey, congratulations.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.748
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.351
[Derrick K]
I'm so happy for Casey.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.819
If there's one girl

20:53.819 --> 20:56.855
that I'd want to see win
an individual competition,

20:56.855 --> 20:59.257
overcome her fears, it's Casey.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.259
[laughs]

21:01.259 --> 21:02.628
But Steve, on the other hand,

21:02.628 --> 21:03.996
he's probably gonna take
a shot at me

21:03.996 --> 21:05.831
because I put him in earlier.

21:05.831 --> 21:08.200
But it's okay, because I got
two life shields to help me out.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.738
[TJ]
And now, Steve, Casey,

21:12.738 --> 21:15.641
you are both safe
from elimination,

21:15.641 --> 21:18.677
and now I need you to go
back to the house,

21:18.677 --> 21:21.279
deliberate and nominate
four players.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.650
Two will be selected
to go into the Arena

21:24.650 --> 21:27.152
and go against our losers.

21:27.152 --> 21:30.522
I'll see you very soon
and good luck.

21:30.522 --> 21:32.758
[applause]

21:40.132 --> 21:42.668
[tense music playing]

21:54.513 --> 21:57.115
-Congratulations.
-Yeah, appreciate it.

21:57.115 --> 21:59.518
-Is this just us?
-Shut that door.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.820
Do you have an idea
which way you're gonna go?

22:01.820 --> 22:04.156
I gotta get
the three-headed monster off.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.457
[Nehemiah] Which one's that?

22:07.659 --> 22:10.495
All I ask is you protect
the house like you said.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.197
You protect the house,
my nigga. That's why...

22:12.197 --> 22:14.266
You see why I went hard,
I went hard, I went hard.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.867
I tried, I tried to tip
the scales with you

22:15.867 --> 22:18.603
and LT up there,
so protect the house, baby.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.006
So the way to do that
would be...

22:21.006 --> 22:23.775
Jodi and Cohutta
have a life shield.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.310
Correct.

22:25.310 --> 22:28.113
They are going to protect
the three-headed monster.

22:28.113 --> 22:31.416
So the way to do that
is to throw them people first

22:31.416 --> 22:33.618
that we know
they're going to protect

22:33.618 --> 22:35.821
so now they can't use
their life shield.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.689
[Steve] Can they use it for
themselves, though?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.357
I thought they would use it
for themselves though, right?

22:39.357 --> 22:41.626
They could and that might
be a way to go.

22:41.626 --> 22:44.529
[Steve] This is a way
to break up a group

22:44.529 --> 22:47.132
that's going to be more and more
powerful as time goes on.

22:47.132 --> 22:50.736
People are tired of seeing
the same group of leadership

22:50.736 --> 22:53.371
but no one wants
to put themselves out there.

22:53.371 --> 22:56.341
Hell, I haven't been here
in 18 years.

22:56.341 --> 22:58.076
Now I already
have a target on my back,

22:58.076 --> 23:00.112
I might as well make this move.

23:00.112 --> 23:04.082
Brad has a really good chance
of taking out Derrick,

23:04.082 --> 23:08.120
who threw you in,
first chance he got.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.389
And so third pick
will be obvious

23:11.389 --> 23:12.924
that no one's going to vote for.

23:12.924 --> 23:16.128
I know Katie's your girl,
so do whatever you need to.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.562
[Steve]
Yep. I love Katie.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.200
I deserve to be
in the spot I'm in

23:22.200 --> 23:23.668
and I accept that for sure.

23:23.668 --> 23:27.472
I felt more comfortable
going into an elimination

23:27.472 --> 23:30.041
versus standing on the side
of a building.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.476
And I've said, so many times,

23:31.476 --> 23:33.245
that I don't want to go
against Kendal.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.480
I did that last season.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.916
Since I know I'm going
into elimination,

23:37.916 --> 23:39.951
I am so happy that Steve won

23:39.951 --> 23:43.421
because we promised each other
we'd look out for each other.

23:43.421 --> 23:46.258
Please just don't put in Kendal.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.661
[ominous music playing]

23:53.899 --> 23:55.534
Okay.

23:55.534 --> 23:56.835
[Steve]
Congratulations.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.471
Congratulations to you, too,
winner.

23:59.471 --> 24:00.806
So I will go first,

24:00.806 --> 24:02.340
-if that's okay with you?
-Yep.

24:02.340 --> 24:03.842
I'm assuming
that you want Derrick in.

24:03.842 --> 24:05.310
Correct.

24:05.310 --> 24:08.847
Jodi will fight to use
her life shield on Derrick.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.816
Can we put Cohutta
and Jodi up first

24:10.816 --> 24:12.684
so they use the life shield
on themselves?

24:12.684 --> 24:14.352
And then I can put Derrick in.

24:15.420 --> 24:17.923
-You fucking brainiac.
-I know.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.259
Derrick and I have done
several challenges together.

24:21.259 --> 24:25.263
I tend to stray away
from ever working with him

24:25.263 --> 24:26.665
because I've seen him

24:26.665 --> 24:29.000
stab his own friends in the back

24:29.000 --> 24:31.803
when it comes to furthering
himself in the game.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.706
I'm not gonna put myself
in that position.

24:34.706 --> 24:37.676
Oh, God, we're just such
the brains of this operation.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.277
Okay, so once
they're out of the way,

24:39.277 --> 24:41.112
who's the pawns
in this operation now?

24:41.112 --> 24:45.517
So what I would propose
is putting Derrick versus Tyler.

24:45.517 --> 24:46.852
Tyler has all the girls

24:46.852 --> 24:49.754
and he'll have my group
of roommates.

24:49.754 --> 24:52.657
Okay, so here's who I see
voting for Tyler.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.926
[Steve] Hopefully this doesn't
blow up in our face.

24:54.926 --> 24:56.428
[Casey]
Let's do Cohutta and Tyler.

24:56.428 --> 24:58.163
That way we can have
an epic blindside

24:58.163 --> 24:59.464
against Derrick

24:59.464 --> 25:00.565
because wouldn't you
just love that?

25:00.565 --> 25:02.701
-Yep.
-All right, girls.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.302
[Steve]
I need Katie here.

25:04.302 --> 25:07.439
She's my campaign manager.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.907
Let me ask you this.

25:08.907 --> 25:10.709
What girls do we think
would vote for Derrick,

25:10.709 --> 25:12.344
because one of them is Kendal.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.912
[Steve] No, but Katie doesn't
want to go against Kendal.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.547
[Casey] But Kendal is a vote
for Derrick

25:15.547 --> 25:17.182
so if we take her off the board,
she can't vote.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.319
[Steve] Okay. So, who--
after Jodi saves herself?

25:21.319 --> 25:23.088
I mean, to me,
Ayanna's an easy answer.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.857
I'm just, like, just going by
what she said when she jumped.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.626
She said the Superbowl
as her answer.

25:27.626 --> 25:30.061
Well, 'cause
I'm taking off Kendal

25:30.061 --> 25:32.764
because I think she's a vote
in Derrick's direction.

25:32.764 --> 25:35.867
If we take Ayanna off,
either of them can beat Katie.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.537
What's more important,
taking Derrick out against Brad

25:39.537 --> 25:42.574
and getting one of them out?
Do we risk Katie?

25:43.008 --> 25:44.442
I'm a little frustrated.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.745
We just made a damn good move
on the guys' side

25:46.745 --> 25:49.648
and Katie didn't do
this challenge today.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.417
I've got bigger fish to fry
in this game,

25:52.417 --> 25:55.120
so I just can't be
super concerned

25:55.120 --> 25:59.724
with what's going on
in Steve's head about Katie.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.495
I think Derrick getting out
is more important

26:03.495 --> 26:05.664
-for me and for you.
-[Casey] Okay.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.365
Ayanna gets put up afterwards.

26:07.365 --> 26:08.867
Are you comfortable
with all of this?

26:10.468 --> 26:12.037
Katie's going to be
so pissed at me.

26:21.713 --> 26:24.282
[Casey] Let's see what Cohutta
and Jodi have to say about it.

26:24.282 --> 26:25.650
[Steve]
Yep.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.353
[Jodi]
Hey, y'all.

26:30.655 --> 26:32.457
Oh. I see what you guys did.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.226
I mean, I'm obviously
gonna save myself.

26:35.226 --> 26:37.495
-Yeah, I'm gonna... I mean...
-[Steve] What?

26:38.330 --> 26:39.965
That was understandable.

26:39.965 --> 26:42.801
This is the most selfish thing
I've ever did in all my days.

26:42.801 --> 26:45.704
I don't care, it's not selfish,
you earned this.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.405
Earned not being on that board.

26:48.873 --> 26:50.976
We had a feeling you guys
would use your life shields.

26:50.976 --> 26:54.446
Okay, then I think I have
a feeling what you're gonna do.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.249
Steve has had a mental
breakthrough.

26:58.249 --> 27:00.885
He wanted to see Derrick
in the elimination

27:00.885 --> 27:03.254
and I'll be damned
if he didn't figure out

27:03.254 --> 27:05.924
a very precise way
to make that happen.

27:05.924 --> 27:09.995
Derrick's our boy and we won't
let this go unpunished.

27:11.796 --> 27:12.897
[laughs]

27:15.166 --> 27:17.369
-[MJ] Is my name on it?
-Not looking good for you, MJ.

27:17.369 --> 27:18.770
[MJ]
Shut up.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.072
I can see Derrick
'cause Derrick threw him in.

27:21.072 --> 27:22.474
[whoops]

27:22.474 --> 27:24.142
[MJ]
Oh, shit.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.211
[Nehemiah] Everybody takes that
breath that you just took.

27:26.211 --> 27:29.681
[MJ] I know. Everybody just
holds they breath coming around.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.416
I'm not surprised.

27:32.717 --> 27:34.419
[Ayanna]
When you send Ayanna home,

27:34.419 --> 27:37.655
you going to have to work
real hard.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.958
I'm not giving it
to anybody easy.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.495
That money can really change
the lives of my children and I.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.063
I'm playing to win

27:45.063 --> 27:48.133
and I'm a little upset that
more people that are here

27:48.133 --> 27:49.667
are trying to sneak by.

27:50.568 --> 27:51.770
And Derrick and Kendal?

27:53.505 --> 27:54.639
Okay.

27:54.639 --> 27:57.976
[tense music playing]

27:59.044 --> 28:01.446
[Katie] How the fuck
does that happen?

28:01.446 --> 28:02.814
It's like a...

28:02.814 --> 28:03.848
[Steve] We made Jodi
use her life shields

28:03.848 --> 28:06.384
and it is Ayanna and Kendal.

28:06.384 --> 28:07.385
Huh?

28:07.385 --> 28:08.620
We had to save ourselves,

28:08.620 --> 28:09.954
we were forced
to save ourselves.

28:09.954 --> 28:12.924
So now the girl options
are Kendal...

28:12.924 --> 28:14.759
Why would you put Kendal
in there?

28:14.759 --> 28:18.496
I didn't want her to. No, she
has the votes over Ayanna.

28:18.496 --> 28:20.265
It's going to be Ayanna.

28:20.265 --> 28:21.866
Going against me, idiot.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.569
I'm not sure why
Steve's acting like

28:24.569 --> 28:26.271
he did me some kind of favor

28:26.271 --> 28:28.440
putting me against one of the
strongest girls in the house.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.774
I'm just... I'm baffled.

28:29.774 --> 28:32.110
Why he would do me dirty
like that

28:32.110 --> 28:35.447
when I'm the only person here
who would look out for him.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.582
[Steve]
You said you didn't care.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.685
I said use your brain,

28:40.685 --> 28:42.821
Use your brain.

28:42.821 --> 28:46.124
God, you need lessons in how
to play this game. [sighs]

28:46.124 --> 28:49.527
I said pick who you think
I'm gonna fuckin' beat.

28:49.527 --> 28:52.764
[ominous music playing]

29:22.494 --> 29:23.795
[Casey]
I'll go ahead.

29:25.029 --> 29:26.564
Um...

29:26.564 --> 29:28.399
For the girls,

29:28.399 --> 29:30.802
what I saw was fair was that

29:30.802 --> 29:33.238
Ayanna was the first person
to drop.

29:33.238 --> 29:36.341
That was my logic
in putting Ayanna in.

29:36.808 --> 29:40.345
I feel like Steve and I probably
had some common ground

29:40.345 --> 29:43.248
in wanting Derrick to go in.

29:43.248 --> 29:45.483
And Kendal, I felt that
you were a vote for Derrick.

29:45.483 --> 29:47.185
I hate to put you
in that position.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.486
We've all gotta do it.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.255
I never expected you to go in.

29:50.255 --> 29:54.993
My request to Steve was please
not Kendal, that didn't happen,

29:54.993 --> 29:57.295
so I'm hoping that you guys
can make sure it doesn't.

29:57.829 --> 29:59.931
Y'all look, I came to play,

29:59.931 --> 30:02.233
-I came to play.
-[cheering]

30:07.372 --> 30:09.073
[Ayanna]
It's time.

30:09.073 --> 30:12.043
17 years ago in New Mexico...

30:12.043 --> 30:15.346
I slept in my uniform last night
cause I wanted to win today.

30:15.346 --> 30:17.649
Sometimes,
it takes a lot more than that.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.885
Sometimes, your uniform has
to be your mindset.

30:20.885 --> 30:24.055
So I was taking it up
several notches.

30:25.623 --> 30:29.661
I'm dying. Anybody who's gonna
go against Ayanna's wishes

30:29.661 --> 30:33.064
is, like, got a thing coming.

30:34.032 --> 30:36.301
Um, I obviously thought that

30:36.301 --> 30:39.070
I was gonna have a life shield
available to use.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.773
But you guys decided to burn
my life shields

30:41.773 --> 30:43.274
and I thought
that was pretty dirty.

30:43.274 --> 30:46.511
Your life shields,
or Jodi and Cohutta's?

30:46.511 --> 30:48.413
[Derrick K] You know,
if anyone knows what I mean...

30:48.413 --> 30:51.616
Casey has literally just turned
into the queen of the south.

30:51.616 --> 30:53.051
Who is this person?

30:53.051 --> 30:54.886
She has won, she has power,

30:54.886 --> 30:57.889
and, my God,
heads are gonna be rolling.

30:59.224 --> 31:00.725
I'm sorry, go ahead.

31:00.725 --> 31:03.294
So, if you decide to shoot
your shot at me right now,

31:03.294 --> 31:06.331
don't miss,
'cause when I come back,

31:06.331 --> 31:09.067
either from this vote
or that elimination,

31:09.067 --> 31:13.771
I'm gonna take pleasure and joy
taking aim at your asses.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.575
I'm curious to see
how the votes line up now.

31:17.575 --> 31:21.112
Uh, short and sweet.
Ayanna, my vote will be for you

31:21.112 --> 31:23.681
and my vote is for you, Derrick.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.617
Ayanna and Tyler.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.185
Voting for you, Ayanna.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.721
Um, my entire room
would kill me

31:29.721 --> 31:32.357
if I didn't vote for you,
Derrick.

31:32.357 --> 31:35.126
Come sleep in our room, bro.
There's gonna be one missing.

my vote is for you.

Shoot your shots.

And if you wanna threaten,
if you wanna threaten...

it is what it is,

31:52.176 --> 31:54.045
My two votes
are for Ayanna and Derrick.

31:54.045 --> 31:56.247
This is like a mobster film.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.615
Ayanna and Derrick.

31:57.615 --> 32:00.685

32:18.102 --> 32:21.806
[Nehemiah] To see Derrick go in
is so rewarding

32:21.806 --> 32:23.708
to be able to be the one
that executed it.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.244
It's like, it feels good.

32:26.244 --> 32:29.847
Don't ever come after me again,
ever.

Let's fucking get crazy, baby.

32:31.916 --> 32:34.052
Derrick and I have one
other elimination round

32:34.052 --> 32:35.653
that we've had together
and that was

32:35.653 --> 32:37.989
on Gauntlet 2 and he beat me
and sent me home.

32:38.423 --> 32:40.425
This is far
from an ideal situation.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.193
I've never gone home
this early in a challenge

32:42.193 --> 32:44.829
and I am not willing to make
an exception today.

32:45.730 --> 32:46.731

Brad's beard.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.483

Can't wait till Brad sees it.

33:09.420 --> 33:10.888
[Jonna]
This is not what I thought

33:10.888 --> 33:12.623
I was gonna be using
my weave hair for.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.692
Nehemiah wants to show
his support for Brad

33:14.692 --> 33:18.096
so he's like, "Hey, Jonna,
I know you have like some weave

33:18.096 --> 33:20.231
"and some hair glue,
like, is there any way

33:20.231 --> 33:21.432
that you can, like,
create a beard?"

33:23.468 --> 33:25.103
You can discharge the patient
at this time.

into Brad himself

he looks up there

in the house.

-Brad.
-Yes.

[tense music playing]

35:30.294 --> 35:32.730
As you can see,
there are two giant ramps here

35:32.730 --> 35:34.532
in the middle of the Arena.

35:35.666 --> 35:38.035
Inside each ramp,
there's a puzzle.

35:38.035 --> 35:40.238
The only way to reveal
that puzzle

35:40.238 --> 35:42.206
is to get all 1000 pounds

35:42.206 --> 35:45.610
all the way across the Arena
and into your ramp.

that I win this elimination

was not what I expected.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.754
in this game is Derrick.

39:49.754 --> 39:51.255
I know he's gonna give
everything he has

39:51.255 --> 39:52.723

to see him back.

[Melinda] This showdown between
Derrick and Brad is intense.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.431
I mean, you could see the veins

40:00.431 --> 40:02.900
bulging out of their muscles
and they're just sweating.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.102
They look like
these bad-ass warriors.

40:05.102 --> 40:07.271
I mean, this is definitely
a showdown

40:07.271 --> 40:10.407
that everybody
has been waiting to see.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.010
Let's go, Derrick!

Nothing but heart
out there, boys. Let's go.

40:17.114 --> 40:20.384
I'm fighting to help my mom out
because she works two jobs.

40:20.384 --> 40:23.053
My mom is my heart.
I'll always be fighting for her.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.423
[MJ] Go! This is why
you're champions, boys!

40:26.423 --> 40:28.025
That's it, Brad.

40:28.025 --> 40:30.294
I always tell my sons
that there's somebody out there

40:30.294 --> 40:32.163
that would do anything
for one more day.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.065
I want them to see that even
when times are tough,

40:35.065 --> 40:37.101
you can still make beauty
in the battle.

the oranges over to the left.

All those people rooting
for Brad

41:22.112 --> 41:26.083
are about to shit their pants
the second I finish this puzzle.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.118
And I'm gonna do things

41:28.118 --> 41:31.522
to destroy every single one
of your games.

[Nehemiah] If Derrick comes back
in the house,

41:41.232 --> 41:43.200
he's probably gonna come
after me again

41:43.200 --> 41:46.403
and it might be me and him
in this Arena next.

now you're moving.

immediately hug each other.

Like, such a wave of relief.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.968
We took so many risks

42:17.968 --> 42:20.537
and every single one of them
paid off.

42:20.537 --> 42:22.640
[Teck] Way to fight, way to
fight, way to fight, guys.

That was a fight, gentlemen.

[Derrick K] Today,
Brad was the better man.

42:29.179 --> 42:32.049
I was forced to make
game moves and I got burned.

42:32.516 --> 42:34.385
[Brad] Got a couple of names
of people

42:34.385 --> 42:36.420
that put me in a pretty rough
position with some friends

42:36.420 --> 42:38.289
so got some names that I don't
have to look out for any more

42:38.289 --> 42:39.556

to the house with a life shield.

in elimination relatively soon,
