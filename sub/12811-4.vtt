Dad told you to keep
your head down!

00:05.455 --> 00:06.754
What did you think would happen?

00:07.154 --> 00:08.054
that's lovely.

00:08.354 --> 00:09.254
What do you think?

00:09.254 --> 00:10.054
Real?

00:10.354 --> 00:11.654
Every folicle.

00:12.454 --> 00:13.454
Hey, stranger!

00:15.453 --> 00:17.553
Uncle Jimmy was the closest
thing I had to a father.

00:17.853 --> 00:18.952
He chose the wrong.

00:18.953 --> 00:19.853
Cleverman, didn't he?

00:20.253 --> 00:21.153
We can't take them.

00:21.153 --> 00:22.053
Yes, we can!

00:24.652 --> 00:26.652
I want those three escapee's
back by the six o'clock news!!

03:27.328 --> 03:28.428
- Guess we're.
- Blood brothers now.

03:28.728 --> 03:29.728
Yeah.

03:31.928 --> 03:33.628
Mr. Slick.

- The killings.
- At the old people's home.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.724
Has got the protesters
all riled up again.

04:04.124 --> 04:07.423
I talked to Slade about
getting a film crew in here.

04:07.723 --> 04:09.523
- Another eight.
- People are dead.

04:09.923 --> 04:11.223
Slaughtered.

04:11.323 --> 04:12.722
And you're talking
about film crews.

04:12.822 --> 04:14.722
They use propaganda against us.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.622
We need to fight back
in a way they can understand.

04:18.022 --> 04:19.822
Get them to see that the
Hairies are just like them.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.821
If we can't do that,
we're screwed.

04:22.321 --> 04:25.221
The last attempt at getting footage
didn't exactly turn out right.

04:25.521 --> 04:27.421
Calling in the professionals.

04:27.521 --> 04:29.620
Slade?

04:29.720 --> 04:31.020
Seems genuine.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.220
It's not gonna stop the
killings, though, is it?

04:34.520 --> 04:36.719
They're calling it a massacre.

04:37.119 --> 04:39.319
That's the language of war.

04:39.719 --> 04:42.619
It doesn't matter how many
feel-good stories you tell

04:42.919 --> 04:45.618
about what nice folk
the Hairies are.

04:47.018 --> 04:48.218
Have you spoken - to Koen yet?

04:48.618 --> 04:50.618
What do you want me to do, beg?

04:51.017 --> 04:53.217
He's the ordained one.

04:53.617 --> 04:54.616
Koen has no idea.

04:54.617 --> 04:55.717
You need to talk to him.

04:56.017 --> 04:57.517
- He won't listen to me.
- So make him.

04:57.817 --> 04:59.516
Shouldn't be up to me.

04:59.916 --> 05:01.816
I can only control what I can.

05:05.916 --> 05:07.515
Oi.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.114
<i>Are Hairies welcome?</i>

05:15.514 --> 05:18.014

<i>Are Hairies human?</i>

05:19.814 --> 05:21.013
Not like us!

05:21.014 --> 05:22.513
See you.

05:22.913 --> 05:25.013
- <i>Do we want them outside the wall?</i>
- Hairies out!

05:25.513 --> 05:26.813
<i>- Are Hairies welcome?</i>
- Hairies out!

05:27.313 --> 05:29.212

checking the progress

05:40.111 --> 05:41.611

coming to the Zone.

Can you call me?

05:44.910 --> 05:47.210
<i>Stop harboring the
Hairies, you black bastard!</i>

05:47.710 --> 05:49.210
<i>- Do we want</i> - <i>them in our schools?</i>
<i>- Hairies out!</i>

05:49.610 --> 05:50.810
- How long are you.
- In the country for?

05:51.010 --> 05:52.109
Three months.

05:52.209 --> 05:53.209
Where you headed next?

05:53.409 --> 05:54.809
Vietnam, Thailand,

05:55.209 --> 05:57.009
- maybe Cambodia.
- If my budget stretches.

05:57.309 --> 05:59.209
Hey, Cambodia.

05:59.509 --> 06:00.708
Angkor is a must.

06:01.008 --> 06:04.408
The ancient Khmer were truly one
of the great civilizations.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.108
Ruins in need - of a makeover.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.407
You have no soul for travel.

06:10.307 --> 06:11.507
All right.

06:11.907 --> 06:14.107
It'll take a few minutes
for the drug to take effect.

06:14.507 --> 06:17.206
After that, I'll be putting you
through a series of tests.

06:17.606 --> 06:19.206
- Till then, just relax.
- Awesome.

06:19.306 --> 06:20.206
Okay.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.006
Using the placebo
or the Hairy juice?

06:22.106 --> 06:23.705
Real thing.

06:30.005 --> 06:34.504
Jamie, just pedal as hard as you
can for as long as you can.

06:34.904 --> 06:37.004
We'll be measuring
your body's response.

06:45.802 --> 06:47.902
<i>Is he gonna turn Hairy?</i>

06:48.302 --> 06:50.902
We're focusing on target
heart rate levels for now.

06:51.302 --> 06:53.801
<i>Still steady at 65.</i>

06:55.601 --> 06:58.501
<i>That pace is remarkable.</i>

07:03.200 --> 07:05.600
He's just smashed the
world 1k sprint record.

07:10.599 --> 07:11.698
Whoa.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.099
Whoa, whoa.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.299
- What's happening?
- He's heating up.

07:15.699 --> 07:16.698
<i>I thought we had sorted this.</i>

07:16.998 --> 07:19.398
I lowered the
mitochondria levels.

07:19.698 --> 07:21.597
Heart rate's 200.

07:21.598 --> 07:22.998
<i>250.</i>

07:24.397 --> 07:26.097
350.

07:36.596 --> 07:39.096
See that his family
are looked after.

07:52.094 --> 07:53.494
<i>As terror
mounts in the community</i>

07:53.894 --> 07:56.593
<i>following the nursing home massacre,
there is renewed pressure</i>

07:56.993 --> 07:58.393
<i>on the government's
containment policies.</i>

07:58.693 --> 08:01.693
<i>This massacre is the first time
that multiple people are suspected</i>

08:01.993 --> 08:03.892
<i>to have been murdered
by a Hairyman in one incident,</i>

08:04.392 --> 08:07.192
causing grave concern that more
multiple attacks will follow.

08:07.392 --> 08:08.392
<i>Belinda Frosche, - Network 8.</i>

08:08.792 --> 08:09.692
Slut.

08:09.693 --> 08:10.791
<i>What?</i>

08:28.889 --> 08:30.789
<i>Go away.</i>

08:38.587 --> 08:40.888
I think this is a conversation
you should be having with Mom.

08:44.487 --> 08:46.487
Not expecting you to understand.

08:46.787 --> 08:49.486
But I want you
to know it's over.

08:49.986 --> 08:54.686
Like I said, you're talking
to the wrong person.

09:02.185 --> 09:04.284
I thought our family
was different.

09:06.584 --> 09:10.484
<i>I thought you were
different, better.</i>

09:10.884 --> 09:13.683
<i>At least that's what everyone
else seems to think.</i>

09:17.183 --> 09:18.582
<i>I mean, Jesus, Dad.</i>

09:18.583 --> 09:19.982
<i>Why?</i>

09:20.382 --> 09:22.682
And her of all people?

09:23.082 --> 09:26.182
Blaming the Hairies for all those
killings like she just loves it?

09:31.981 --> 09:34.181
I reckon you'd have more to say
if some guy did this to me.

09:43.879 --> 09:45.979
<i>If you don't tell Mom, I will.</i>

10:05.976 --> 10:06.975
Good song?

10:06.976 --> 10:08.076
I made it.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.676
You gonna do something?

10:16.075 --> 10:17.375
I'm not her keeper.

10:24.574 --> 10:25.974
<i>Mate...</i>

10:27.674 --> 10:28.773
Would you like a drink?

10:28.873 --> 10:31.273
- Where is he?
- Out the back.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.273
You look like a whiskey man.

10:34.773 --> 10:36.572
- I'll get you one.
- On the house.

10:36.772 --> 10:38.072
<i>How do you take it?</i>

10:38.172 --> 10:39.371
Neat.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.972
Yes.

10:41.272 --> 10:45.371
See, I like a man who
appreciates his single malt.

10:45.671 --> 10:48.671
- The punters here, - they mix
cola, <i>All sorts of rubbish.</i>

10:48.871 --> 10:49.971
<i>It's a travesty.</i>

10:50.371 --> 10:51.870
What the hell - are you doing?

10:52.170 --> 10:53.870
- About to ask you.
- The same thing.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.070
- More people dead, - and what are you.
- Doing about it?

10:56.470 --> 10:57.970
- What?
- That soccer kid.

10:58.270 --> 10:59.469
Old people last night.

10:59.569 --> 11:00.569
Or don't you watch the news?

11:00.869 --> 11:02.869
- All dead, all with.
- Their hearts ripped out.

11:03.169 --> 11:05.069
What are you on about?
Hairies did all that.

11:05.469 --> 11:07.268
- They're not.
- What's doing the killing.

11:16.567 --> 11:17.967
Never got it, did you?

11:18.267 --> 11:19.567
<i>It's just stories, - Waruu,</i>

11:19.967 --> 11:21.667
- Like the Easter Bunny,
- like Santa Claus.

11:21.967 --> 11:22.866
- I'm sorry.
- To break it to you.

11:22.966 --> 11:27.066
More people are gonna
die unless you act.

11:27.366 --> 11:30.765
Waruu, go home and
be the big man.

11:31.265 --> 11:32.565
- Jimmy give you.
- The nulla nulla?

11:44.164 --> 11:45.763
You better pray
you remember how to use it.

11:54.162 --> 11:55.662
Oi, brah, she's with me.

11:56.062 --> 11:57.462
- What?
- She's with me.

11:57.862 --> 11:59.862
The hell she is.

12:00.062 --> 12:01.661
I said she's with me.

12:01.761 --> 12:03.960
Come on.

12:03.961 --> 12:05.361
Oi.

12:05.461 --> 12:06.661
<i>Hey.</i>

12:11.560 --> 12:13.460
Blair, - get him out of here.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.660
Get out of here.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.959
<i>Out!</i>

12:17.159 --> 12:19.859
It's not exactly magic, is it?

12:20.259 --> 12:22.059
You're a disgrace.

13:13.352 --> 13:15.252
Stupid.

13:32.949 --> 13:34.249
<i>What do you guys call it?</i>

13:34.349 --> 13:36.349
Us guys?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.549
Don't give me shit, Koen.

13:38.849 --> 13:40.348
Your people.

13:46.748 --> 13:48.347
The Namorrodor.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.247
And it rips the heart
out of its prey?

13:53.547 --> 13:55.746
That's how the story goes.

13:56.146 --> 13:57.746
Your brother seems to think
it's more than a story.

13:58.146 --> 14:00.446
Well, Waruu doesn't know shit.

14:00.846 --> 14:03.146
Right about the Cleverman
thing, though?

14:07.045 --> 14:08.445
You're the only person
that can kill it.

14:08.845 --> 14:10.045
Ash.

14:10.145 --> 14:11.244
How would you do it?

14:11.544 --> 14:12.844
Come on.

14:12.944 --> 14:14.144
Hypothetically speaking.

14:14.344 --> 14:15.544
If it was real.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.843
You wouldn't just dong it
on the head with this.

14:20.143 --> 14:22.143
Hey, you're not allowed.

14:24.643 --> 14:27.842
'Cause I'm a woman.

14:28.142 --> 14:30.242
You remember that much, then.

14:33.242 --> 14:35.341
Okay, you can't just
bash it on the head.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.041
- There's...
- There's stuff.

14:37.341 --> 14:39.741
There's cultural stuff.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.639
Cultural stuff.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.340
Yeah.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.940
Boy.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.739
We're all fine, then.

15:03.038 --> 15:04.637
'Night.

15:24.335 --> 15:25.635
Angel.

15:25.735 --> 15:26.835
Hey.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.634
I thought you wanted
to draw a line in the sand.

15:33.234 --> 15:36.433
Ilythia offer - a totally different
process to what we've been through.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.033
Yeah, you have to be
a supermodel to get pregnant.

15:39.533 --> 15:42.733
The marketing's appalling, but the
science, it's... It's very...

15:44.032 --> 15:46.532
Go on, tell me
about the science.

15:46.932 --> 15:48.732
- Well, essentially.
- They spike the ovum.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.332
- With a supercharged.
- Mitochondria.

15:50.731 --> 15:52.331
- So that it has.
- A better chance of taking.

15:52.431 --> 15:53.931
Spike?

15:54.131 --> 15:56.031
Yeah, that's the Latin term.

15:59.330 --> 16:03.030
What do they take
the mitochondria from?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.630
A plant, I think.

16:08.329 --> 16:11.429
Well, it's all under patent,
so they were a little vague

16:08.329 --> 16:11.329
about the details.

16:13.029 --> 16:15.328
I wasn't gonna go, but...

16:16.928 --> 16:18.227
They've got a 95%

16:18.228 --> 16:19.728
success rate, Jarrod.

16:21.028 --> 16:23.027
What?

16:23.327 --> 16:27.427
Just, I thought we decided...

16:27.827 --> 16:29.426
it's too heartbreaking.

16:29.526 --> 16:32.026
I know.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.126
I know, but...

16:58.923 --> 17:01.022
Look, um...

17:02.722 --> 17:04.422
I've got an appointment
for Wednesday.

17:04.722 --> 17:07.222
Um, will you come?

17:09.320 --> 17:11.421
Jarrod?

17:11.521 --> 17:13.221
Jarrod.

17:16.020 --> 17:18.119
Of course I'll be there.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.319
- How long till we eat?
- I need to make a call.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.519
Just give me five, yeah?

17:27.919 --> 17:31.218
<i>The heat exchange was greatest in the
adipose tissue in his back, yes?</i>

17:31.618 --> 17:33.218
- Correct.
- <i>Now listen.</i>

17:33.618 --> 17:36.118
<i>All we need to do
is separate the mitochondria</i>

17:36.518 --> 17:39.417
<i>from the uncoupling protein.</i>

17:39.917 --> 17:42.817
<i>We'd need some form
of uncoupling inhibitor.</i>

17:43.217 --> 17:44.817
I'd start with Sestrin-2.

17:45.117 --> 17:46.516
<i>- Do it.
- Proof it.</i>

17:46.716 --> 17:48.216
Let's move forward.

17:53.316 --> 17:55.315
Open your mouth.

17:57.015 --> 17:59.315
How could you do this?

17:59.415 --> 18:01.214
Mouth.

18:33.610 --> 18:34.610
Latani, come on.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.410
I'll find them.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.809
Hey, girl, what do you
think you're doing?

18:42.209 --> 18:45.209
Djukara, you got to shave.

18:45.609 --> 18:47.508
They're looking for you.

18:47.608 --> 18:48.708
Boy!

18:51.708 --> 18:53.208
Get out of here.

18:53.308 --> 18:54.807
<i>Put some more weights
on that rack.</i>

18:55.007 --> 18:56.707
- Teach me.
- No.

18:57.107 --> 18:59.107
Why? Is it because I'm a Hairy?

19:05.606 --> 19:07.906
Hey, you deaf?

19:08.206 --> 19:09.506
<i>Leave it.</i>

19:11.605 --> 19:13.105
Come on, Gub.

19:13.205 --> 19:14.605
Slow your feet down.

19:14.905 --> 19:15.905
You gotta mean - the hit.

19:16.205 --> 19:17.404
Lead.

19:17.405 --> 19:18.504
Lead with the shoulder.

19:18.804 --> 19:20.104
Use your hips, okay?

19:20.404 --> 19:22.204
Jab, jab, and then counter.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.803
<i>- That's it.
- That's it. That's it.</i>

19:26.003 --> 19:28.203
<i>Jab, jab, and counter.</i>

19:28.503 --> 19:29.502
<i>Again.</i>

19:29.503 --> 19:30.503
<i>Jab, jab, counter.</i>

19:30.803 --> 19:31.903
<i>- Keep it tight.
- Keep it tight.</i>

19:32.103 --> 19:33.202
Jab, jab.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.402
That's it, that's it.

20:06.098 --> 20:08.298
Whoa.

20:08.698 --> 20:09.748
Hey there, little brother.

20:09.749 --> 20:10.798
How you doing?

20:11.098 --> 20:12.497
I'm all right.

20:12.597 --> 20:14.097
Look strong.

20:14.397 --> 20:15.897
What can - I do you for?

20:16.297 --> 20:17.697
I'm looking - for a weapon.

20:17.997 --> 20:19.296
Well, take your pick.

20:19.396 --> 20:20.496
Whatever you need.

20:24.096 --> 20:25.296
I need to find my father.

20:27.595 --> 20:29.295
- So you want something.
- A bit more serious.

20:31.295 --> 20:33.895
Something like that?

20:50.492 --> 20:52.392
What are you gonna do?
Bust in there single-handed?

20:52.692 --> 20:54.192
It seriously
won't get you anywhere.

20:54.492 --> 20:55.592
It'll be all right.

20:55.992 --> 20:57.392
- I know where he is.
- I was there.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.891
Knowing where he is and getting
there aren't the same thing.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.490
Hey.

21:01.491 --> 21:02.891
I'll be all right.

21:03.391 --> 21:05.690
What, so you're just gonna walk through
the checkpoint - with your nonexistent ID?

21:05.990 --> 21:08.290
Even if you did, you'd be
picked up on the streets

21:08.590 --> 21:09.790
by the CA in a second
looking like that.

21:10.090 --> 21:10.990
I'll wear a hoodie.

21:11.190 --> 21:12.690
- And gloves.
- And a balaclava.

21:13.089 --> 21:14.688
I'm not shaving.

21:14.689 --> 21:16.189
Then you're an idiot.

21:26.288 --> 21:27.788
- - Hairies out! Hairies out!
- No, no, no, no, no.

21:28.188 --> 21:30.187
You can't come in, mate. You
gotta... you gotta back it up.

21:30.387 --> 21:32.687
You can't come in, all right?

21:33.187 --> 21:36.286
<i>Hairies out!
Hairies out! Hairies out!</i>

21:51.984 --> 21:53.684
Oi.

22:00.383 --> 22:02.183
- CA not letting.
- The food trucks through.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.683
We haven't had delivery
for two days now.

22:04.983 --> 22:06.882
He's trying to starve us out.

22:08.982 --> 22:10.882
Matthews.

22:11.182 --> 22:12.882
What are we gonna do?

22:14.781 --> 22:16.381
Leave it with me.

23:03.775 --> 23:05.375
Here.

23:08.574 --> 23:10.074
Are you okay?

23:13.474 --> 23:15.074
No. No.

23:15.374 --> 23:17.573
That's Koen's.

23:17.873 --> 23:19.573
- He'll go nuts.
- If he sees you.

23:19.873 --> 23:21.273
Hey, Ash, - can you help me?

23:24.372 --> 23:26.872
It's private stuff.

23:27.072 --> 23:27.972
Kora.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.672
Kora?

23:29.972 --> 23:32.771
Well, we have to
call her something.

23:53.269 --> 23:55.068
That's Koen's mum.

23:56.668 --> 23:58.368
He never talks about her.

24:01.268 --> 24:02.367
<i>She died in a car accident.</i>

24:04.167 --> 24:05.166
Hit and run.

24:05.167 --> 24:06.467
They never found out who did it.

24:08.067 --> 24:10.366
She died before
he was even born.

24:13.666 --> 24:15.266
Emergency C-section.

24:15.466 --> 24:16.866
Holy shit.

24:17.265 --> 24:18.665
Hey, no, no, no!

24:19.065 --> 24:20.365
- Hey, hey, hey,
- hey, hey, hey.

24:20.665 --> 24:23.365
Yeah, false alarm.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.664
What are you doing, Ash?

24:26.964 --> 24:27.964
It wasn't Ash, bro.

24:28.264 --> 24:29.964
- It was our home alone.
- Friend here.

24:37.463 --> 24:39.063
- Oi, can...
- That's good, yep.

25:10.559 --> 25:12.358
- I want to see.
- Minister Matthews.

25:12.658 --> 25:14.258
Do you have - an appointment?

25:14.358 --> 25:15.358
No, I don't.

25:15.658 --> 25:17.258
The minister is away
from the office at present.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.157
I'll wait - till he gets back.

25:19.457 --> 25:21.157
- Name?
- Waruu West.

25:21.457 --> 25:22.557
And what's this about, Mr. West?

25:22.957 --> 25:24.657
- He knows.
- What it's about.

25:47.654 --> 25:49.054
<i>Matthews.</i>

25:49.453 --> 25:51.253
<i>Mr. Waruu West.</i>

25:51.553 --> 25:52.852
What does he want?

25:52.853 --> 25:54.153
<i>To see you.</i>

25:54.553 --> 25:57.252
<i>What should I tell him?
You have an 11:00.</i>

25:57.552 --> 25:59.252
The 11:00 can wait.

25:59.652 --> 26:00.852
- Just make sure.
- He's comfortable.

26:01.252 --> 26:03.552
I'll see him once I've
finished up here.

26:05.051 --> 26:06.651
The minister will see you
as soon as he's able.

26:06.951 --> 26:08.651
Can I get you a tea? Coffee?

26:08.751 --> 26:10.351
No, thanks.

26:36.147 --> 26:37.747
Call Waruu West.

26:51.145 --> 26:52.945
- Waruu West.
- <i>Jarrod Slade.</i>

26:53.445 --> 26:56.445
<i>I've got a reporter coming to
the Zone today as we discussed.</i>

26:56.945 --> 26:58.344
<i>I believe you might know her.</i>

26:58.544 --> 27:01.644
<i>Belinda Frosche.</i>

27:01.844 --> 27:03.244
Great.

27:03.544 --> 27:05.644
Thanks, but I'm not sure
she's right for the job.

27:06.043 --> 27:08.143
<i>She's perfect...
Audiences trust her</i>

27:08.543 --> 27:10.643
and she's been on this story
from the start.

27:10.943 --> 27:12.343
<i>But sending a woman...</i>

27:12.743 --> 27:14.642
<i>Look, I have nothing
against Ms. Frosche.</i>

27:15.042 --> 27:16.642
<i>It's a volatile place.
The Zone is...</i>

27:16.942 --> 27:18.842
How very old-fashioned
of you, Mr. West.

27:19.242 --> 27:21.242
Believe me, Belinda knows
how to handle herself.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.941
I'm sure she does,
but it's not her world.

27:24.241 --> 27:27.241
It's not my wife's either, but I'm
not worried about her working there.

27:27.641 --> 27:30.240
Well, the...
The clinic is different.

27:30.640 --> 27:35.940
<i>It's your good work that keeps
things safe,</i> keeps my wife safe.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.839
I'll get Belinda
to give you a call.

28:11.335 --> 28:13.535
I know you.

28:13.935 --> 28:16.434
I've seen your face
somewhere before.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.132
Atta girl.

28:33.732 --> 28:35.332
Get on the bed.

29:34.224 --> 29:36.424
How long?

29:36.524 --> 29:37.724
Two hours.

29:37.924 --> 29:38.924
Structural damage?

29:39.024 --> 29:40.023
None.

29:40.323 --> 29:41.523
Unless you count the box.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.623
Incubation time.

29:44.023 --> 29:45.222
Mouse 30 minutes.

29:45.223 --> 29:46.323
90 for the chimp.

29:46.623 --> 29:48.922
It worked on the chimp?

29:49.322 --> 29:51.122
The chimp didn't cook?

29:54.821 --> 29:56.921
The mouse is gonna break
its neck in there.

29:59.021 --> 30:00.221
And humans?

30:00.521 --> 30:02.421
Are you volunteering, sir?

30:16.919 --> 30:18.418
Hey, stranger.

30:18.518 --> 30:20.018
So I'm heading your way.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.717
<i>Where are you?</i>

30:21.718 --> 30:22.918
Yeah, I'm heading off now.

30:23.418 --> 30:25.517
<i>Meet me inside the checkpoint
in 20 minutes.</i>

30:25.817 --> 30:27.317
- You gonna take me.
- To meet your wife?

30:27.517 --> 30:28.817
<i>Don't play games.</i>

30:29.217 --> 30:30.517
Come on, Waruu.

30:30.617 --> 30:32.017
We're freaking adults.

30:32.317 --> 30:35.016
Well, you know we were.

30:35.516 --> 30:37.916
Look, this doesn't need to
be a miserable experience.

30:38.316 --> 30:40.516
Checkpoint, 20 minutes.

30:42.815 --> 30:44.415
- Tell the minister.
- I had to cancel.

30:50.314 --> 30:52.014
After you, sir.

32:28.002 --> 32:29.201
I'm inside the gate.

32:29.301 --> 32:30.301
Where are you?

33:07.496 --> 33:09.396
Are you sure
this is the right place?

33:31.493 --> 33:33.293
They're gone.

33:34.893 --> 33:36.593
They're all gone.

33:39.692 --> 33:41.092
They're dead.

33:41.492 --> 33:42.892
They're all dead.

33:43.192 --> 33:44.892
You don't know that.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.691
I'm never gonna see
my father again!

33:57.590 --> 33:59.590
<i>We should tell my dad.</i>

33:59.790 --> 34:01.889
<i>He'll know what to do.</i>

34:05.389 --> 34:07.189
- Should have.
- Just left me here.

34:08.987 --> 34:11.588
<i>At least I'd have
been with my father.</i>

34:24.985 --> 34:27.085
<i>Hairies out! Hairies out!</i>

34:30.886 --> 34:32.585
Yeah, whatever.

34:32.685 --> 34:34.485
Hey.

34:34.885 --> 34:38.485
I'm... I'm looking for someone to
take me to meet the Hairy people.

34:38.784 --> 34:40.184
Hey, man, - she's on the news.

34:40.384 --> 34:42.484
You wanna be my tour guide?

34:44.583 --> 34:45.784
Got 10 bucks?

35:01.582 --> 35:03.181
- She wants to see.
- The Hairies,

35:03.581 --> 35:05.381
- But we thought we should.
- Check with Waruu first.

35:05.681 --> 35:06.881
- Hi.
- I'm Belinda Frosche.

35:07.081 --> 35:08.381
I know exactly who you are.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.780
Network 8.

35:09.980 --> 35:11.780
I've seen the reports.

35:12.180 --> 35:16.280
My husband Waruu's not
here, but how can I help?

35:16.680 --> 35:19.979
I'm interested in getting the
other side of the story.

35:20.379 --> 35:22.579
You know, seeing things
from the perspective

35:22.580 --> 35:24.978
of the Hairy peoples,
and I was...

35:25.378 --> 35:27.878
just hoping that
someone could take me

35:28.178 --> 35:30.678
to where they live
and introduce me.

35:31.078 --> 35:33.177
I can take you down to
the Hairy precinct.

35:33.477 --> 35:36.077
Sure they'll be happy
to speak to you.

35:36.377 --> 35:38.577
I'll just get my bag.

35:54.475 --> 35:56.874
Well, you've been busy.

35:57.174 --> 35:59.174
Break and enter.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.674
Conspiracy to commit murder.

36:03.673 --> 36:07.873
Conspiracy to perform
a terrorist attack.

36:08.273 --> 36:10.473
Member of a terrorist
organization.

36:10.872 --> 36:13.972
The Brotherhood
is a peaceful movement.

36:14.472 --> 36:16.772
This peaceful symbol was
drawn in a man's blood.

36:24.471 --> 36:26.170
Listen, we know you're holding

36:26.570 --> 36:28.870
these subhuman fugitives
in the Zone.

36:30.670 --> 36:32.170
Hand them back to us

36:32.570 --> 36:35.869
and we'll forget you had
anything to do with it.

36:36.169 --> 36:38.169
I'm not giving you these boys.

36:41.269 --> 36:43.768
Do you wanna see
your family again?

36:46.668 --> 36:51.967
Those boys didn't kill that
guard, but I know who did.

36:53.867 --> 36:56.567
You've got photos of me in
the containment center.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.566
Have another look.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.466
- I'm wearing a camera.
- On my chest,

37:00.966 --> 37:03.466
And I have footage of that
guard being murdered.

37:03.866 --> 37:05.865
The government's got
plenty of mileage

37:06.365 --> 37:09.465
out of blaming the Hairy
boys and stirring up hate,

37:09.765 --> 37:12.564
but I saw who did it,
and it wasn't a Hairy.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.264
And the Hairy boys didn't
paint this symbol either.

37:16.664 --> 37:19.664
There wasn't a mark on the wall
after that guard was killed.

37:19.963 --> 37:24.463
You blokes or someone
you work for did that.

37:24.863 --> 37:27.063
So go ahead and
charge these boys.

37:27.263 --> 37:29.362
See how far you get.

37:33.662 --> 37:35.162
Yeah.

37:35.661 --> 37:37.961
<i>We're further along
than we thought we were.</i>

37:38.361 --> 37:39.961
<i>We need to accelerate things.</i>

37:40.261 --> 37:41.461
What do you want me to do?

37:41.861 --> 37:44.260
Pick up the item... now.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.660
We need it for the next stage.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.457
That's it, off the backboard.

38:14.756 --> 38:17.656
Shoot a jump shot. That's it.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.151
Wait.

39:00.850 --> 39:02.050
- He's here.
- Yeah?

39:02.450 --> 39:03.750
It's the big guy, - Maliyan.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.750
- We need to talk.
- To him first.

39:06.150 --> 39:08.049
Do you think this
would be all right?

39:08.349 --> 39:09.648
I'd say so.

39:09.649 --> 39:10.849
Okay.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.249
It's best you go on
your own from here.

39:13.649 --> 39:15.048
- They might not talk.
- If I'm there.

39:17.848 --> 39:19.248
All right.

39:21.048 --> 39:22.548
All right.

39:42.845 --> 39:44.045
Hey, it's this girl.

39:44.445 --> 39:45.545
<i>What?</i>

39:47.044 --> 39:48.243
Hi.

39:48.244 --> 39:49.344
My name's.

39:47.044 --> 39:49.344
Belinda Frosche.

39:49.744 --> 39:50.843
I'm from Network 8.

39:50.844 --> 39:51.844
I know you.

39:52.244 --> 39:53.843
- That's... okay.
- I'm just a reporter.

39:54.243 --> 39:55.343
- I just wanna ask.
- Some questions.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.643
- And get the other side.
- Of the story.

39:56.943 --> 39:57.943
Really, bitch?

40:00.943 --> 40:03.442
<i>I can...</i>

40:04.042 --> 40:05.842
- I can help - get your message.
- Out there, you know?

40:06.342 --> 40:08.142
<i>And we don't have to...
We don't have to film</i>

40:08.242 --> 40:10.641
<i>if that's not what you want.</i>

40:11.041 --> 40:13.841
I can help change
people's minds.

40:17.340 --> 40:18.540
<i>Please, just...</i>

40:18.940 --> 40:20.339
<i>Just think about
what you're doing.</i>

40:20.340 --> 40:21.040
Shh.

40:21.340 --> 40:22.440
- Maliyan.
- What?!

40:22.740 --> 40:23.640
- Come on, you don't.
- Have to do this.

40:24.039 --> 40:26.139
You skin-mob always
telling us what to do!

40:26.439 --> 40:27.438
Just let her go, please.

40:27.439 --> 40:29.339
Go on, kill her.

40:31.339 --> 40:35.038
If you don't, she'll go back
and tell them lies about us.

40:37.438 --> 40:40.737
But if you do kill
her, get ready.

40:41.137 --> 40:42.937
She's white.

40:43.037 --> 40:44.937
She's famous.

40:45.137 --> 40:49.036
And they'll come back
after all of us.

40:49.236 --> 40:50.836
And you know it.

40:53.736 --> 40:55.135
Screw this!

40:58.935 --> 40:59.635
Thank you.

41:00.035 --> 41:01.735
I'm saving us, not you.

41:01.935 --> 41:04.834
You're not worth dying for.
You're scum.

41:08.134 --> 41:10.333
They shot my little sister.

41:11.633 --> 41:14.233
And your people filmed it.

41:14.733 --> 41:17.233
You didn't even
try and say anything.

41:17.533 --> 41:19.032
- You didn't try.
- And stop them!

41:21.832 --> 41:25.232
You just let them film it!

41:25.631 --> 41:30.831
And then you played it on the television
over and over and over again!

42:06.426 --> 42:08.526
- Let me help you.
<i>- I'm okay.</i>

42:20.724 --> 42:22.524
You're so full of it.

42:26.324 --> 42:28.723
You build this...
wall around you.

42:29.023 --> 42:31.023
That right?

42:31.423 --> 42:34.423
You're not alone in this, Koen.

42:34.722 --> 42:37.522
You have Blair.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.222
You have me.

42:42.122 --> 42:43.621
We're with you.

42:45.721 --> 42:48.421
You just need to tell us how we
can help you kill that thing.

42:48.621 --> 42:50.620
You hear yourself?

42:51.020 --> 42:52.820
- You know how crazy.
- That sounds?

42:53.320 --> 42:55.920
Not as crazy as someone who's
been given some special gift,

42:56.220 --> 42:58.119
using it to pour beer.

43:05.318 --> 43:06.718
Hey.

43:12.618 --> 43:15.317
I don't think the universe
stuffed up, by the way.

43:16.817 --> 43:18.917
You've always had something.

44:01.411 --> 44:03.211
She was here.

44:08.210 --> 44:09.610
You do what you want to me.

44:09.611 --> 44:10.810
I can take it.

44:13.110 --> 44:16.409
But getting - Alinta involved,
- That's not on. - You hear me?

44:20.509 --> 44:22.008
Nerida...

44:27.008 --> 44:28.508
God, Waruu, just 'cause
you want something

44:28.908 --> 44:30.607
doesn't mean
you have to take it.

44:33.907 --> 44:36.707
You were so close
to losing everything...

44:37.207 --> 44:41.906
Me, Alinta, the respect of
the people around here.

44:44.606 --> 44:47.505
You wanna sort your shit out.

44:47.905 --> 44:52.105
We've worked too hard and too
long for you to mess it up now.

45:03.403 --> 45:04.603
No! No!

45:05.003 --> 45:06.803
Remember how we talked about
what's cool and not cool?

45:07.203 --> 45:08.802
This is definitely not cool!

45:09.102 --> 45:10.802
Kora, put the gun down!

45:12.502 --> 45:14.002
- Where the hell.
- Did she get a gun?

45:14.302 --> 45:15.402
Thought we needed protection.

45:15.602 --> 45:18.001
Yeah, we do, brah, from her.

45:18.101 --> 45:19.201
Aah!

45:19.601 --> 45:20.900
- Nobody move, here!
- No!

45:20.901 --> 45:22.601
Kora! Kora!

45:22.901 --> 45:24.700
Give me the gun.

45:25.100 --> 45:26.600
Give me the gun.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.300
- Here, here, here.
- Ash.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.499
Here, here, here.

45:31.599 --> 45:32.899
Here.

45:37.699 --> 45:41.398
You've got something of mine and
I've got something of yours.

45:43.598 --> 45:47.197
Give me back the girl
and you can have your friend.

45:47.297 --> 45:48.497
Sounds simple.

45:48.897 --> 45:51.497
It's the way
I like to keep things.

45:51.797 --> 45:53.097
No one need get hurt.

45:53.397 --> 45:55.396
And what happens to her?

45:55.696 --> 45:57.796
The girl?

45:58.096 --> 45:59.796
That's not your problem.

46:03.395 --> 46:04.995
Kora?

46:05.295 --> 46:07.095
Come down here.

46:10.394 --> 46:11.694
Kora!

46:18.293 --> 46:19.793
It's all right, Kora.

46:20.093 --> 46:21.793
- Go on.
- Go to the man.

46:25.392 --> 46:27.192
Go on.

46:31.392 --> 46:32.591
Now Ash.

46:32.891 --> 46:34.491
Issue there.

46:34.791 --> 46:36.091
Boss wants you, too.

46:41.990 --> 46:44.090
- Hey.
- Ash?!

46:44.490 --> 46:47.490
Ash... Call an ambulance!

46:47.889 --> 46:49.589
- <i>Call an ambulance!</i>
- Help us.

46:50.789 --> 46:53.289
Ash, Ash, Ash, Okay, I...

47:04.587 --> 47:07.387
Ash. Ash.

47:10.786 --> 47:12.286
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

47:13.786 --> 47:14.885
Ash.

47:14.886 --> 47:16.486
Ash?

47:18.885 --> 47:22.485
Hey. Ash! Ash!

47:22.785 --> 47:26.484
Ash. Ash. Ash.

47:26.884 --> 47:29.284
Ash? I love you.

47:29.684 --> 47:31.384
- Stay with me.
- Baby?

47:31.684 --> 47:32.683
Ash.

47:32.684 --> 47:33.783
We need to go, bro.

47:34.083 --> 47:36.483
No. I'm not leaving her.

47:36.783 --> 47:37.983
- Blair, we need - to get out...
- Ash.

47:38.283 --> 47:41.682
Blair, she's gone, okay?
She's gone.

47:42.082 --> 47:42.882
- Get out of here.
- Come on!

47:43.182 --> 47:44.782
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

47:44.882 --> 47:46.182
<i>Ashley!</i>

47:47.582 --> 47:49.581
- Glowing...
- Now, we gotta go.
