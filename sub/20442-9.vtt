- You'd wanna hang out sometime?

00:02.865 --> 00:03.727
I'd like that.

00:03.753 --> 00:06.656
I look forward to every minute

00:06.689 --> 00:09.058
So stick around, Okay?

00:09.092 --> 00:10.293
I'm not going anywhere.

00:10.326 --> 00:13.130

Welcome to Grey House.

00:48.296 --> 00:49.531
I'm Cassie.

00:49.564 --> 00:51.768
- What's your name?
- Pavla.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.336
Hey, Pavla.

00:56.372 --> 00:59.375
- Are you here with your parents?
- They're not here anymore.

00:59.408 --> 01:02.112
- Hmm.
- Pavla?

01:02.144 --> 01:04.446
Well, somebody wants
to know where you are.

01:04.479 --> 01:06.425
Pavla?

01:08.416 --> 01:10.385
Pavla, you scared us.

01:10.419 --> 01:12.722
I just wanted to find out
what was over here.

01:12.755 --> 01:15.357
- Are you looking to stay here?
- A few nights, yeah.

01:15.391 --> 01:17.526
We just adopted our first daughter.

01:17.559 --> 01:19.461
Congratulations!

01:19.494 --> 01:23.499
She saw your sign and she was
curious what a "Grey House" was.

01:24.902 --> 01:27.669
Why don't you go help get
your things out of your car

01:27.702 --> 01:29.872
and then come in and see
what your room looks like?

01:29.906 --> 01:31.450
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:44.452 --> 01:47.290
Oh, it's a big change
for a girl her age.

01:47.323 --> 01:49.425
For all of us. Eddie and I

01:49.457 --> 01:52.594
have wanted children for so
long... and her parents died

01:52.627 --> 01:55.330
in a car accident last year,
leaving her with no family.

01:55.363 --> 01:57.267
That's horrible...

01:57.300 --> 01:59.369
I just hope that we're able

01:59.401 --> 02:02.437
to love that little girl as much
as I'm sure they must have.

02:02.814 --> 02:05.909
Pavla is very fortunate
to have parents like you.

02:05.942 --> 02:08.678
And I'm sure you're going
to make a wonderful family.

Noah. He's visiting his mom in New York.

03:17.746 --> 03:19.715
- Hey.
- Oh,

03:19.749 --> 03:21.717
I was just about to
come looking for you.

03:22.358 --> 03:25.688
I was organizing some jewelry in my shop

03:25.721 --> 03:29.459
and I found these. Thought
they'd look good on you.

03:29.985 --> 03:33.328
- Those would look good on me.
- What's all that?

03:33.362 --> 03:36.666
- Paperwork.
- Aren't there computers for that?

03:36.698 --> 03:38.534
Yes. And that one isn't working.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.270
So you have to
go through it all by hand? Ew.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.273
No, I don't mind.

03:43.305 --> 03:45.507
It gives me a chance to look
back at the names of people

03:45.541 --> 03:48.478
who've stayed here whose lives
were different when they left.

03:49.212 --> 03:51.347
I never thought about it like that.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.417
Those people are kind of your legacy.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.286
I don't know, I think we all live on

03:57.320 --> 03:59.056
through the differences we make.

04:00.722 --> 04:03.392
Then I'm hardly living on at all.

04:03.894 --> 04:06.061
You've made a lot of
differences in people's lives

04:06.095 --> 04:10.066

be making a lot more.

04:10.098 --> 04:12.027
Yeah...

04:12.768 --> 04:14.770
- Well, thanks for the earrings.
- Mhm.

04:17.672 --> 04:19.659
Hello, Sam.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.680
Hey. What are you working on?

04:23.713 --> 04:26.851
- Oh, some Grey House business.
- Keeping the lights on, you know.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.105
So...

04:32.821 --> 04:34.823
do you have anything going on tonight?

04:34.857 --> 04:37.527
- Nope.
- What about tomorrow night?

04:37.559 --> 04:40.329
- I don't think so.
- And the night after that?

04:40.362 --> 04:42.431
- I'm pretty sure I'm free.
- Hm.

04:42.465 --> 04:44.633
Do you wanna make some sort of plans?

04:44.667 --> 04:47.869
Oh, I don't know. But now
I know we can if we want to.

04:47.903 --> 04:52.374
Then I'll make sure to keep
my future open, just in case.

- No, what news?

I don't know if I should be
the one to announce it, but...

05:16.564 --> 05:19.067
There's going to be
a wedding in Middleton!

05:19.100 --> 05:21.069
- A wedding?
- Yes,

05:21.102 --> 05:23.538
and I'm so glad that I got to
be the one to tell you,

05:23.571 --> 05:25.641

of surprise on your face!

I didn't even know my son
was seeing anyone, let alone

05:49.016 --> 05:50.985
- about to get married!
- Yeah!

05:51.019 --> 05:53.021
It's moving along a lot
faster than we thought.

05:53.054 --> 05:55.457
Well, you two seem
already very much in love.

05:55.490 --> 05:57.725
Yeah. We are.

05:57.759 --> 05:59.378
At first we were going
to have a big party

05:59.403 --> 06:00.528
just to announce
our engagement, and then

06:00.562 --> 06:03.331
we started thinking of all the
planning a wedding would take...

06:03.365 --> 06:05.100
and all the money
my mother would want to spend.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.101
So we decided,

06:07.134 --> 06:08.854
let's just get it done
without the hassle.

06:08.887 --> 06:11.601
Even though I consider
the planning to be half the fun.

06:11.633 --> 06:14.776
- I know. We're sorry.
- I have a way

06:14.809 --> 06:17.479
- of disappointing my mother.
- No, no...

06:17.511 --> 06:20.415
It's just, a simple wedding
is what we want most of all,

06:20.447 --> 06:22.116
and when Michael was
telling me about Middleton,

06:22.149 --> 06:24.051
it just seemed like
the right place to do it.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.454
Well, I think you made
the perfect choice,

06:26.487 --> 06:30.124
and will be very happy by the time
you leave here as husband and wife.

06:30.874 --> 06:33.662
Oh, my goodness, my son
is going to have a wife!

06:34.586 --> 06:35.896
Yeah,

06:35.930 --> 06:38.100
yeah, well, you know, I don't
know how it happened, either.

06:39.178 --> 06:40.568
How did you two meet?

06:40.601 --> 06:43.637
Michael was a driver for the
car service my family uses.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.071
You had a job?!

06:45.096 --> 06:46.874
You knew I wanted to start
a business like that.

06:46.908 --> 06:49.478
Well, yes, but you didn't
tell me you were working.

06:49.511 --> 06:52.678
I wanted to make sure it was going
to last before I said anything.

06:52.710 --> 06:55.916
We got to know each
other every time he picked me up.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.522
He was just so good-hearted

06:58.554 --> 07:02.989
and it seems old-fashioned
to say, but kind.

07:05.116 --> 07:06.761
He takes after his mother that way.

07:06.795 --> 07:10.132
Well, Vanessa, you can get
settled here in Grey House while

07:10.165 --> 07:12.768
I get all of the arrangements
in place for your wedding.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.969
Mom, we don't really
need any arrangements.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.505
(Sigh!) Thank you. Michael,

07:17.538 --> 07:20.408
you at least need
a place for the ceremony,

07:20.442 --> 07:22.877
a few flowers to spruce things up a bit,

07:22.910 --> 07:25.112
and a cake to celebrate with after.

07:25.146 --> 07:26.982
We don't want anybody
to go to any trouble.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.617
Vanessa, I used to be a wedding planner.

07:29.651 --> 07:32.853
This isn't trouble, this is fun.

07:35.291 --> 07:36.524
Well,

07:36.557 --> 07:39.160
I guess it'd be Okay if you want
to put something together.

07:39.194 --> 07:43.031
- But nothing too complicated.
- It will be my pleasure.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.705
So, when will the rest
of the family be arriving?

07:52.940 --> 07:56.240
I told my mother not to show
up until the day before the wedding.

07:56.273 --> 07:58.359
That way she can
just come in and enjoy it.

07:59.106 --> 08:01.615
Well, tell her she can have
a room here, if she'd like.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.258
Thanks.

08:06.554 --> 08:10.759
Excuse me, is this where the
really good doctors hang out?

08:10.792 --> 08:13.562
- Joanne?
- Look who's here!

08:13.595 --> 08:15.831
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I don't know, I just

08:15.863 --> 08:19.500
happened to find myself on this part of
the globe and decided to look you up.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.870
- Eve, this is my sister...
- Joanne.

08:21.903 --> 08:24.706
- Nice to meet you.
- Is my brother treating you Okay?

08:24.738 --> 08:27.108
You could probably use a raise.

08:27.141 --> 08:29.978
You know, she should
probably get a raise.

08:30.011 --> 08:32.847
- I like your sister a lot.
- How is Nick?

08:32.881 --> 08:36.616
- Taller than last you saw him.
- Wait, he's not twelve anymore.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.553
No. He's going to love seeing you.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.988
Okay, this is all a little bit different

08:41.020 --> 08:42.991
than the last time
I saw you in New York.

08:43.024 --> 08:45.193
Yeah, a lot of things
are different since then.

08:45.634 --> 08:47.662
If that means you're dating somebody,

08:47.694 --> 08:51.233
- it had better be someone I like.
- It does. I am.

08:51.266 --> 08:53.668
You'll like her. We should all
go out to dinner tonight.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.670
- Okay, that would be perfect.
- When's my next appointment?

08:56.704 --> 08:57.951
You've got half an hour.

08:57.976 --> 08:59.840
Oh, well, lets go to the house
and get you settled in.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.643
That would be good. I could
use some rest after the trip.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.497
That's something I hardly
ever hear you say.

09:04.522 --> 09:07.014
My sister's hiked
halfway around the world.

09:07.048 --> 09:09.284
Which means I still have halfway to go.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.343
(chuckling) Come on.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.591
(silly music)

09:19.371 --> 09:21.729
What are you going to do with those?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.797
I don't know.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.667
I wasn't expecting them to be so big.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.237
I was going to use them as part of a
flower display in the window but...

09:30.271 --> 09:32.173
Oh, they would take up
the whole display.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.209
Yeah. And they're a bit
gaudy to keep out here

09:35.242 --> 09:37.311
so I don't know what
I'm going to do with them.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.548
(dramatic gasp) Oh, my goodness.

09:40.582 --> 09:43.316
They're perfect!

09:44.051 --> 09:46.620
I was looking for something to
give Michael and Vanessa's wedding

09:46.654 --> 09:49.858
a little extra pizazz and there it is.

09:49.891 --> 09:52.560
You want to use
these peacocks at a wedding?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.563
- Oh, I want a whole dozen.
- We're having

09:54.595 --> 09:56.830
a simple ceremony at city hall

09:56.863 --> 09:59.633
but we could put one of these at
the end of each row of chairs.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.903
Are you sure that's what
Michael and Vanessa want?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.706
Oh, please, they don't know what
they want. They're young and in love

10:05.739 --> 10:07.198
and they're not thinking straight.

10:07.223 --> 10:09.577
So it's a good thing they have
me to think for them.

10:09.611 --> 10:12.080
Now, how quickly can you
get me as many as I need?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.045
Oh, I can get these
shipped here overnight.

10:14.070 --> 10:15.249
Then do it.

10:16.523 --> 10:19.219
ACHOO!

10:19.252 --> 10:22.924
Excuse me. I don't know what...
Achoo! Achoo!

10:22.957 --> 10:26.895
Oh, my goodness. I don't know
what's come over me.

10:26.928 --> 10:30.932
Didn't you once tell me that
you were allergic to feathers?

10:30.964 --> 10:35.069
- Oh, that's so true.
- It's why I can never wear boas.

10:35.103 --> 10:37.072
Then you probably don't wanna walk down

10:37.104 --> 10:40.341
- an aisle lined with these, then.
- I suppose you're right.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.044
We'll just keep it simple, as
the bride and groom requested.

10:43.077 --> 10:48.249
- That's probably for the best.
- Achoo! Sorry.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.618
So, what'd you do while you were there?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.720
Uh, not a whole lot.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.989
My mom and I used to do a lot of stuff,

10:55.022 --> 10:57.724
before she and my dad got divorced.

10:58.159 --> 11:02.030
But now that she married Jason,
it's never just the two of us.

11:02.063 --> 11:05.800
He's always there, too,
so we don't get to be together.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.837
So, it sounds like the trip
was hardly worth it.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.339
I would have rather been here.

11:14.776 --> 11:16.877
When my mom got married,

11:16.910 --> 11:20.247
everybody tried to tell me
I would be gaining a dad.

11:20.281 --> 11:22.983
But what happened was

11:23.016 --> 11:25.335
I lost my mom instead.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.389
So you have to figure out how
to get by with just one parent.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.925
Yeah.

11:32.185 --> 11:33.829
Yeah.

11:37.231 --> 11:40.435
Um, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

11:40.468 --> 11:42.670
I was waiting until you got back.

11:42.704 --> 11:43.853
Okay?

11:45.473 --> 11:47.154
I missed you.

11:48.348 --> 11:49.844
I missed you, too.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.920
Do you want to see what I'm doing?

12:03.748 --> 12:06.393
This is where I mark
everyone coming and going.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.797
And everyone staying here, like
you and your new mom and dad.

12:11.256 --> 12:12.901
Why aren't you with them?

12:12.934 --> 12:15.837
They said I could look around
as long as I stayed in the house.

12:15.869 --> 12:19.108
That's nice of them,
letting you explore on your own.

12:19.142 --> 12:22.944
- Yeah, I think I like them.
- I don't know.

12:22.977 --> 12:26.948
Well, when you decide
for sure, let them know, Okay?

12:26.981 --> 12:28.314
Okay.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.991
- Did Pavla come through here?
- She did.

12:38.025 --> 12:41.496
- We've hardly seen her all day.
- She's been through so much,

12:41.529 --> 12:44.933
but we thought once we got her away
from the orphanage, she would open up.

12:45.290 --> 12:47.735
I lost my parents at a young age.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.003
That's not something she's
just going to forget about.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.006
I'm really sorry to hear that.

12:52.039 --> 12:55.009
I learned to love the people
who came into my life

12:55.041 --> 12:58.378
and took care of me. I suspect
that Pavla will, too.

12:58.970 --> 13:00.763
I hope so.

13:05.712 --> 13:09.990
Oh, Abigail? I'm getting a delivery
of new guest towels tomorrow.

13:10.024 --> 13:12.794
If I'm not around, would you
mind putting them in the armoire

13:12.827 --> 13:14.796
in the guest room
at the end of the hall?

13:14.829 --> 13:16.497
'Cause I'm running this place now?

13:17.155 --> 13:19.434
Because I'm asking you to do a favor.

13:19.991 --> 13:22.270
I guess I can do one of those.

13:28.910 --> 13:31.846
I probably should have warned you
that my sister is nothing like me.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.047
That's true. Most of our
friends can't figure out

13:34.080 --> 13:36.884
how we came out of the same house.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.920
That is kind of weird.
Aunt Joanne actually likes to laugh

13:39.954 --> 13:41.991
and have fun, while Dad...

13:43.958 --> 13:45.894
Well, you know him.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.462
Yeah, I'm not any fun at all.

13:49.282 --> 13:50.799
When were you in Thailand?

13:51.314 --> 13:52.967
How did you know that?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.804
I picked up a bracelet
similar to this when I was

13:55.837 --> 13:58.840
- in the Old City of Sukhothai.
- Isn't it gorgeous there?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.941
Did you stay at the Piper Tree?

14:00.974 --> 14:03.243
- I did.
- It's one of my favorite hotels,

14:03.276 --> 14:06.314
second only to
the Windsor Arms in Chicago.

14:06.871 --> 14:08.882
How long are you
going to stay in Middleton?

14:08.915 --> 14:12.820
- Until my brother kicks me out.
- You can stay as long as you like.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.588
And where are you going after this?

14:14.622 --> 14:18.226
- You know, I don't really know.
- Well, that's weird.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.737
You usually have the next two
or three years mapped out.

14:20.762 --> 14:22.563
Sometimes on an actual map.

14:22.597 --> 14:26.034
It's just, right now, I'm not
thinking too far in advance.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.869
But I am very glad
I came here when I did.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.729
So I could see
my big brother this happy.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.376
You did pick a good time to show up.

14:35.409 --> 14:37.846
When life is pretty good.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.514
Mmm-hmm. It's a pretty
good time for me, too.

14:48.636 --> 14:51.507
(cheerful music)

14:58.585 --> 15:02.422
- AAHH!
- Shh! I'm playing hide-and-seek.

15:04.053 --> 15:05.158
Um...

15:06.072 --> 15:07.161
With who?

15:07.194 --> 15:08.975
Just me.

15:11.269 --> 15:13.354
I like your earrings.

15:13.933 --> 15:15.565
Thank you.

15:21.207 --> 15:24.044
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:32.152 --> 15:34.588
- Hey. - Hey.
- Good morning.

15:34.620 --> 15:37.390
- Dinner was fun last night.
- Yeah, I'm glad we were able to do that.

15:37.423 --> 15:39.525
- Stephanie, this is my sister, Joanne.
- Hi.

15:39.558 --> 15:41.928
- Hi.
- Stephanie owns the Bistro.

15:41.961 --> 15:44.431
- Oh, then you're the one
to ask: How's the coffee?

15:44.464 --> 15:46.934
- I can answer that.
- It's the best in town.

15:46.966 --> 15:49.970
Then I will take as much
caffeine as you have, to go.

15:50.003 --> 15:53.007
Joanne's still jet-lagged
from getting in from Venezuela.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.242
And from being all over
the world before that.

15:55.274 --> 15:57.310
I've been trying to add some
international cuisine here

15:57.344 --> 16:00.013
but it's kind of hard to
get the people of Middleton

16:00.047 --> 16:02.248
excited about Pisca Andina soup.

16:02.282 --> 16:05.953
Oh, I found the best recipe
for that in Caracas.

16:05.985 --> 16:07.955
Would you share it with me?

16:07.988 --> 16:09.623
- Yeah, I'll do better than that.
- I'll show you how to make it.

16:09.656 --> 16:13.494
Aw! Well, the coffee is right
there and you can help yourself.

16:13.527 --> 16:15.396
Okay. We will. Thanks.

16:15.428 --> 16:17.043
Thanks.

16:18.031 --> 16:19.038
She seems sweet!

16:19.063 --> 16:20.401
- She really is.
- Yeah, really nice.

16:20.433 --> 16:23.236
- Ah, Stephanie. - Hi.
- I need to talk with you about

16:23.269 --> 16:26.406
the cake you'll be making for
Michael and Vanessa's wedding.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.608
I... I didn't know I was making a cake.

16:27.641 --> 16:30.277
Oh yes, and it needs to be spectacular!

16:30.310 --> 16:33.513
Now, I want it to be multi-tiered

16:33.547 --> 16:36.249
and I was thinking
that each layer could be

16:36.282 --> 16:39.519
one of Michael's favorite
colours from when he was a boy.

16:39.552 --> 16:43.256
Purple on the bottom,
brown in the middle,

16:43.290 --> 16:46.293
and bright green on the top!

16:46.325 --> 16:50.564
Oh... These colours
don't really go together.

16:50.596 --> 16:53.099
Of course they do.
It's the same colour scheme I have

16:53.133 --> 16:54.847
in my master bedroom.

16:55.569 --> 16:57.604
Are you sure you want
such an extravagant cake?

16:57.637 --> 17:00.674
Cassie, one should never go low-brow

17:00.706 --> 17:04.077
with cake. I mean, that is
just a basic rule of life.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.512
But you wouldn't want
to distract from...

17:06.546 --> 17:08.648
well, the simplicity of their day.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.637
Well, I...

17:12.140 --> 17:15.489
Well, then, it's a good thing
Cassie was here to stop this

17:15.521 --> 17:19.092
overzealous mother of the groom
from getting out of hand.

17:19.730 --> 17:23.430
We'll just go with a simple
sheet cake, white frosting.

17:23.462 --> 17:26.332
I think that's an excellent idea.

17:26.365 --> 17:28.301
I thought that son
of mine would boomerang

17:28.327 --> 17:29.737
in and out of our house for years.

17:29.769 --> 17:33.507
But Michael seems to have
actually... grown up.

17:34.662 --> 17:38.011
The love of a woman has
a way of changing a man.

17:38.045 --> 17:40.314
Yes, and now he's found someone
else to take care of him.

17:40.346 --> 17:44.184
Well, good luck with that,
Vanessa, good luck.

17:50.887 --> 17:53.626
We're gonna decorate City Hall
with just a few flowers,

17:53.660 --> 17:56.330
and then have a small reception
at the Bistro after that.

17:56.363 --> 17:57.977
It all sounds perfect.

17:58.431 --> 18:01.367
I can hardly believe you
actually did what we wanted.

18:01.401 --> 18:05.038
Well, you were very clear you
wanted things to be kept simple

18:05.072 --> 18:07.809
and all I had to do was
remember what you said.

18:07.843 --> 18:10.711
And frankly, Cassie kept me honest.

18:10.743 --> 18:14.380
- I wonder what's keeping her?
- Hello, everybody.

18:14.413 --> 18:16.282
Surprise.

18:16.870 --> 18:20.086
- Mom?
- Vanessa.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.523
I told you not to get here until Friday.

18:22.556 --> 18:25.191
Oh well, I decided that
one day before the wedding

18:25.225 --> 18:27.227
wasn't early enough for me
to help with all the things

18:27.259 --> 18:29.496
I'm sure need to be done.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.766
Elizabeth, this is my mom.

18:32.798 --> 18:36.235
- Martha, of course.
- Wonderful to meet you.

18:36.268 --> 18:38.471
- Aww.
- Where's Cassie?

18:38.505 --> 18:42.609
- She's bringing in my bags.
- She insisted that I say here,

18:42.642 --> 18:45.144
even though I told her
I would find a hotel.

18:45.178 --> 18:47.314
Oh, but Grey House is
the nicest place in Middleton.

18:47.346 --> 18:50.283
Is it? Hm.

18:50.316 --> 18:53.152
Uh, we were just going over
some of the wedding plans.

18:53.185 --> 18:55.388
I hope you haven't gotten
too far into things.

18:55.422 --> 19:00.227
I think the mother of the bride
deserves some say in the matter.

19:00.259 --> 19:02.797
(laughing uncomfortably)

19:10.769 --> 19:13.507
- Are you hungry?
- I don't know.

19:13.539 --> 19:17.110
- They've got cookies.
- You can pick one out yourself.

19:17.143 --> 19:18.599
That's Okay.

19:21.269 --> 19:25.147
- Can I go sit over there?
- Oh, sure.

19:27.787 --> 19:29.655
Oh, hello.

19:29.689 --> 19:31.592
Hi Abigail. Marla just
stopped off to buy

19:31.624 --> 19:34.228
a few things. Can Pavla sit here
while I get her a cookie?

19:34.260 --> 19:35.495
Yeah, I can keep an eye on her, sure.

19:35.528 --> 19:37.576
Thanks. I'll just be a minute.

19:42.434 --> 19:44.403
Your new parents seem really nice.

19:44.437 --> 19:47.108
My other parents were really nice, too.

19:49.241 --> 19:52.512
But they went away one day
and never came back.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.250
That kind of happened with my dad, too.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.253
Did he die?

20:01.354 --> 20:04.219
He just... never came back.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.978
I'm sorry you got so sad.

20:07.359 --> 20:09.361
I'm sorry you did, too.

20:12.503 --> 20:16.057
These earrings I lent you
look really good on you.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.742
Thank you.

20:18.915 --> 20:20.851
Thanks for letting me borrow

20:20.884 --> 20:22.819
your history notes for
the classes I missed.

20:22.853 --> 20:24.822
I hope you could read my handwriting.

20:24.854 --> 20:27.557
Are you kidding? It was
neat as the Magna Carta.

20:27.591 --> 20:31.362
Which, thanks to your notes,
I know what that is.

20:31.394 --> 20:33.132
Well, I'm glad that I could help.

20:34.710 --> 20:37.347
You know, my dad, he was
really big into history.

20:37.535 --> 20:41.003
He'd say that every day
that you're alive

20:41.015 --> 20:43.559
could end up being one
that they study forever,

20:44.552 --> 20:47.255
so make sure that you pay
attention to it.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.295
How old were you when he died?

20:56.296 --> 20:57.990
I had just turned eleven.

20:58.666 --> 21:01.436
- Yuck.
- Yeah.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.237
You know, he, um...

21:04.271 --> 21:05.681
he had this thing where

21:06.306 --> 21:10.577
he would bring me a yellow daisy
and he would say, "Grace,

21:10.611 --> 21:13.714
"the only thing brighter
than this flower

21:14.348 --> 21:16.133
"is your smile,

21:17.083 --> 21:19.321
so let's see it."

21:21.488 --> 21:23.933
No matter how sad I was,

21:24.391 --> 21:26.393
it always worked.

21:31.465 --> 21:33.859
I remember coming here with him, too.

21:35.035 --> 21:37.738
I would ask him to push me
higher and higher,

21:37.772 --> 21:41.075
hoping that I would wind up
going all the way around.

21:41.475 --> 21:45.213
Not possible, I found out.

21:45.246 --> 21:48.483
- Because physics.
- Yup.

21:48.516 --> 21:51.218
But I think we could give it a try.

21:51.939 --> 21:53.221
What?

21:53.254 --> 21:55.356
I think we could get you halfway around.

21:55.389 --> 21:58.092
- Hold on.
- Noah!

21:58.124 --> 22:00.160
(giggling)

22:00.193 --> 22:03.530
Now, I was thinking that we
could put seating for the guests

22:03.564 --> 22:06.633
in the hallway and then
do the ceremony up here.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.703
And then the bride
can walk down an aisle

22:08.736 --> 22:10.705
in between the folding chairs...

22:10.737 --> 22:12.707
There's going to be folding chairs?

22:12.739 --> 22:15.308
Well, people have to sit on something.

22:15.342 --> 22:17.711
But do they have to be sitting here?

22:17.745 --> 22:19.714
A city hall doesn't seem
like the kind of place

22:19.746 --> 22:21.649
that people should be married in.
It's where people come

22:21.681 --> 22:23.650
- to get divorced.
- A lot of other

22:23.683 --> 22:25.819
wonderful things happen
in this building, too.

22:25.852 --> 22:28.488
Vanessa, this is not
the extravagant wedding

22:28.522 --> 22:30.725
that you talked about having
when you were a little girl.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.326
Mom, I was, like, six.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.311
But you always knew
what you wanted, even then.

22:35.336 --> 22:37.064
So we need to find another place.

22:37.098 --> 22:40.168
- We don't really have time for that.
- Of course we do. Martha can

22:40.200 --> 22:42.536
start showing me options right away.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.839
I'm sure Martha will help you
find the perfect place.

22:44.871 --> 22:48.442
She always has a way of leading people
right to where they're supposed to be.

22:48.809 --> 22:51.411
Well, I suppose I could do that.

22:51.445 --> 22:54.615
Come with me and I'll show you
the best this town has to offer.

22:54.648 --> 22:56.632
That is exactly what I want to see.

22:56.657 --> 22:58.986
Middleton awaits!

23:00.121 --> 23:01.989
This way.

23:07.660 --> 23:09.326
You hardly ate any dinner.

23:09.351 --> 23:11.498
Is that your subtle way of saying
your big brother can't cook?

23:11.532 --> 23:13.501
No, it was great.

23:13.534 --> 23:15.461
I'm just not really that hungry.

23:17.254 --> 23:19.639
Hey, are you up for a game of dominoes?

23:19.672 --> 23:22.309
I still have our tally from
the last time we played.

23:22.343 --> 23:23.916
Maybe tomorrow.

23:23.948 --> 23:26.889
I just, I think I need to get to bed.

23:28.228 --> 23:29.416
Okay.

23:29.934 --> 23:31.852
Why don't you just finish your homework.

23:31.885 --> 23:35.122
- I'll do the dishes.
- Sounds like a fair deal to me.

23:44.331 --> 23:48.169
- So, when were you planning to tell me?
- I wasn't planning to.

23:48.201 --> 23:50.470
You thought your brother the
doctor wouldn't figure it out?

23:50.504 --> 23:54.342
Maybe I was hoping you weren't
as smart as you used to be.

23:54.374 --> 23:56.544
You're tired, your appetite's
down, you're not making plans

23:56.576 --> 23:58.545
to travel like you always do...

23:58.579 --> 24:00.648
I really don't want to talk about this.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.617
I know. And I'm the guy
who's going to let you not?

24:03.650 --> 24:05.344
(heavy sigh)

24:06.320 --> 24:08.222
Okay. Um...

24:09.823 --> 24:13.495
I've been diagnosed
with episodic ataxia.

24:17.931 --> 24:20.567
- Is it Friedreich's?
- No.

24:20.601 --> 24:24.572
They don't really know
what type it is, exactly.

24:24.604 --> 24:27.074
They say it's not fatal

24:27.675 --> 24:30.344
but it's probably degenerative.

24:30.377 --> 24:33.372
I've already had some muscle weakness.

24:33.746 --> 24:35.624
Joanne...

24:35.949 --> 24:38.871
You know, they gave me all this
information to read about it, but...

24:39.925 --> 24:41.222
I don't want to be defined

24:41.255 --> 24:43.256
by something that's
written in a pamphlet.

24:43.289 --> 24:45.892
I want to see it all. And I'm
gonna talk with your doctor.

24:45.926 --> 24:48.429
Okay, no. See, you don't have to do that.

24:48.461 --> 24:51.665
- You actually think I won't?
- I guess I should have figured

24:51.698 --> 24:53.900
my brother the doctor would
force his way into this.

24:53.933 --> 24:57.237
I'm not doing this because I'm a doctor.

24:57.271 --> 24:59.274
I'm doing it because you're my sister.

25:09.439 --> 25:12.543
(cheerful music)

25:14.710 --> 25:16.713
(door chime)

25:19.716 --> 25:23.154
- Pavla!
- What are you doing here?

25:23.187 --> 25:25.007
Just running around.

25:26.008 --> 25:27.706
Do your parents know where you are?

25:28.218 --> 25:30.507
They might. I don't know.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.912
Okay. One second.

25:38.149 --> 25:40.351
(phone beeping)

25:43.688 --> 25:45.689
Cassie, Pavla's here.

25:45.723 --> 25:47.992
Can you let her parents know she's Okay?

25:48.025 --> 25:50.128
I can go look for them if...

25:50.616 --> 25:52.076
You did.

25:52.530 --> 25:54.966
Okay, I'll keep her here.

26:04.742 --> 26:07.678
- These are pretty.
- Do you want to take one?

26:07.711 --> 26:08.967
Yeah.

26:10.448 --> 26:13.451
- You want to hop up?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:16.821 --> 26:20.824
You know... Your mommy and daddy
are probably looking for you.

26:20.858 --> 26:22.861
Why? I'm right here.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.796
But you keep wandering off.

26:26.235 --> 26:28.567
You know they're not my real parents.

26:30.802 --> 26:32.771
But they want to be.

26:32.803 --> 26:34.805
Which means you're
gonna have to let them.

26:37.871 --> 26:40.611
Is it scary, thinking about

26:40.644 --> 26:43.514
loving new parents when you
still remember your other ones?

26:45.650 --> 26:47.047
A little bit.

26:49.425 --> 26:51.089
A lot.

26:52.302 --> 26:55.526
You never, ever
have to forget about them.

26:56.390 --> 26:58.163
But your new parents?

26:58.196 --> 27:00.436
They're gonna love you just as much.

27:01.728 --> 27:03.967
And they're gonna always find you,

27:04.398 --> 27:06.150
no matter where you are.

27:07.071 --> 27:10.775
- (door chimes)
- Pavla?

27:10.807 --> 27:13.911
We were so worried about you!

27:13.945 --> 27:17.816
We were shopping together
a few stores down.

27:17.849 --> 27:19.408
She disappeared into a clothing rack.

27:19.433 --> 27:21.019
We didn't realize
that she would run out the door.

27:21.052 --> 27:23.053
We ran here as fast as we could.

27:23.086 --> 27:25.923
You ran all the way here
just to find me?

27:25.957 --> 27:28.760
- Of course!
- And we always will,

27:28.793 --> 27:30.757
wherever you are.

27:31.896 --> 27:33.865
I picked this out for you.

27:34.428 --> 27:37.235
- That's very pretty.
- That's why I picked it.

27:37.267 --> 27:39.938
(chuckling)

27:39.970 --> 27:42.039
- Thanks.
- I'm glad she came here.

27:42.073 --> 27:44.007
Me too.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.190
Come on.

27:50.180 --> 27:52.817
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:55.686 --> 27:58.189
(heartwarming music)

28:09.132 --> 28:12.069
So, I spoke with your doctor,
and she's gonna

28:12.102 --> 28:14.738
send over all your charts
and some of your test results,

28:14.772 --> 28:16.741
and then we'll see if I think
we should order any more.

28:16.774 --> 28:19.043
You think more tests are going
to show anything different?

28:19.075 --> 28:21.211
Well, I want to know
what all of our options are.

28:21.245 --> 28:23.715
And I might want to put you
on tetrabenazine

28:23.747 --> 28:26.851
if you start to experience
decreased motor skills.

28:26.883 --> 28:29.253
I think what's good for
decreased motor skills

28:29.286 --> 28:31.722
would be for me to actually
keep using my motor skills.

28:31.755 --> 28:34.625
You want to stay active, sure.
But there are other things we can do.

28:34.659 --> 28:37.594
Sam, I didn't come here
for you to fix this.

28:37.628 --> 28:40.765
I just came here because
I wanted to see you.

28:40.797 --> 28:42.371
And I'm glad you did.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.290
But this is what I do.

28:45.969 --> 28:47.938
Just let me do it.

28:49.503 --> 28:50.841
Okay.

28:56.980 --> 29:01.151
Hello. Did you find a good
place for the wedding?

29:01.185 --> 29:03.621
No, and that's why we're here.

29:03.653 --> 29:06.790
We've been all over town but
Martha hasn't shown me a venue

29:06.823 --> 29:09.294
- yet that I feel is appropriate.
- And I was hoping that

29:09.326 --> 29:11.599
you might think of somewhere
that I haven't considered.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.898
Well, you could do it at Grey House.

29:13.930 --> 29:17.302
You're not suggesting that my
daughter get married at a B&B?

29:17.334 --> 29:20.071
Elizabeth is insisting on a place

29:20.103 --> 29:22.907
that has a "wow" factor of ten.

29:22.939 --> 29:25.043
Hmm. Well,

29:25.075 --> 29:27.210
then, I hope you find some place

29:27.244 --> 29:29.246
that makes you go, "Wow."

29:31.282 --> 29:34.840
I wish we could find
something as beautiful as that.

29:35.386 --> 29:37.589
Oh, that's Henderson's Mill.

29:37.621 --> 29:40.691
It is a stunning place
for a wedding, actually,

29:40.725 --> 29:42.593
but I didn't want to suggest it
for Michael and Vanessa's

29:42.627 --> 29:44.596
because it's prohibitively expensive.

29:44.629 --> 29:47.365
- It sounds perfect.
- Do you think it's available?

29:47.398 --> 29:51.069
Oh. At such short notice?

29:51.101 --> 29:53.604
Well, I can't even imagine
how much it will cost.

29:53.638 --> 29:56.874
Well, that's for me to imagine, so
it's a good thing price doesn't matter.

29:56.907 --> 29:59.578
I'm going to call my daughter
and have her meet us there.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.886
- It really is a lovely place.
- It is.

30:09.583 --> 30:11.121
You never know what kinds of

30:11.155 --> 30:13.258
romantic things might happen there.

30:19.134 --> 30:20.865
Hey.

30:21.428 --> 30:23.167
Oh, hey.

30:24.101 --> 30:25.803
How much studying can one girl do?

30:25.835 --> 30:28.268
- (phone chimes)
- Sorry.

30:31.108 --> 30:33.562
I was supposed to meet Nick and Courtney

30:33.595 --> 30:36.080
but they just texted
and said they decided

30:36.112 --> 30:37.631
to do things on their own.

30:37.663 --> 30:40.884
They've been doing that a lot,
lately. Being on their own.

30:40.918 --> 30:44.389
Yeah, it's not like it used to be.

30:46.357 --> 30:49.293
Look, I'm sorry to run,
but I gotta go home.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.895
So, I'll see you later, then.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.899
Yeah.

31:04.708 --> 31:06.777
Whoa! (Laughing)

31:06.811 --> 31:09.914
- (whispering): Shh, I'm hiding!
- Oh, Okay.

31:09.947 --> 31:11.061
Yeah.

31:15.285 --> 31:17.822
Did you see a little girl in here?

31:17.854 --> 31:19.454
I might have,

31:19.488 --> 31:22.326
- but I don't remember.
- (muffled giggling)

31:24.328 --> 31:27.899
I think she might be right...

31:27.931 --> 31:30.434
- Ah!
- Found you!

31:30.467 --> 31:32.836
I want to hide again. Close
your eyes and count to 100!

31:32.870 --> 31:34.543
Okay.

31:36.207 --> 31:39.243
(parents together): One, two,

31:39.275 --> 31:41.344
three, four,

31:41.378 --> 31:43.915
- five...
- Are you having fun?

31:43.948 --> 31:46.984
- Yeah, but it's so hard.
- They keep finding me!

31:47.016 --> 31:49.986
(chuckling): That's a good thing.

31:50.019 --> 31:53.290
13, 14, 15,

31:53.323 --> 31:56.326
16, 17, 18...

32:02.166 --> 32:05.803
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:05.835 --> 32:09.006
- I have something for you.
- Yeah?

32:12.275 --> 32:15.880
Hey, would you look at that! It worked.

32:16.209 --> 32:18.420
What is this for?

32:19.550 --> 32:21.953
Well, you seemed
kind of alone earlier...

32:21.986 --> 32:24.322
Like you needed something
to smile about.

32:25.302 --> 32:27.025
I like to see you smile.

32:30.361 --> 32:33.230
- You do?
- Yeah.

32:52.048 --> 32:55.290
So, um... thank you...

32:56.500 --> 32:57.922
for the flower.

32:57.955 --> 33:02.226
♪ His heart waking up again ♪

33:02.258 --> 33:06.997
♪ So don't let go ♪

33:07.031 --> 33:10.502
♪ Open up your eyes again ♪

33:15.369 --> 33:17.638
(cheerful music)

33:20.641 --> 33:22.744
We like to set up the
dining room so that our guests

33:22.776 --> 33:25.013
can enjoy the waterfall
as they're having dinner.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.715
- Lovely.
- And we can adapt the outdoor

33:27.747 --> 33:30.051
lighting if you decide
to have the wedding at night.

33:30.083 --> 33:32.053
What do you think?

33:32.085 --> 33:34.288
It's a little more fancy than
I thought it was going to be.

33:34.322 --> 33:37.158
- Yeah, I don't know...
- I think it's perfect.

33:37.190 --> 33:40.477
- Mhm. Right this way.
- Ooh! Thank you.

33:41.208 --> 33:44.731
Oh, it's wonderful in here.

33:44.765 --> 33:46.734
And there's plenty of room for a band.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.969
I didn't know that
you wanted live music.

33:49.003 --> 33:51.972
Well, we have to have
something to dance to.

33:52.872 --> 33:55.343
I'd also like to show you the
atrium. It's the perfect place

33:55.375 --> 33:57.911
- for photos of the bride and the groom.
- Yeah,

33:57.945 --> 34:01.015
- I guess we can take a look.
- Oh, I'd love to see that, too.

34:01.047 --> 34:03.183
Oh. You don't need to
worry about that, Martha.

34:03.217 --> 34:05.501
It's Vanessa's opinion
that matters the most.

34:05.533 --> 34:09.806
- Oh... Of course.
- It's up to the bride.

34:11.201 --> 34:13.567
I should take a look, though,
just to make sure I approve.

34:13.967 --> 34:15.453
Right this way.

34:27.907 --> 34:30.277
- Hello.
- Hi.

34:30.311 --> 34:32.429
How was your day?

34:33.679 --> 34:35.016
Good.

34:35.047 --> 34:38.753
- Oh, um, who gave you that?
- Noah.

34:39.185 --> 34:42.188
- That was nice of him.
- Yeah.

34:42.989 --> 34:44.993
It was.

34:53.934 --> 34:57.905
The oatstraw tea is good
for boosting physical energy

34:57.938 --> 35:02.110
and the red clover has some restorative
properties for bone and cartilage.

35:02.626 --> 35:05.045
- And what about that one?
- What does that one do?

35:05.079 --> 35:07.281
Oh! Nothing. It's just delicious.

35:07.313 --> 35:10.951
Mmm. And there's that moment
right before you taste it

35:10.985 --> 35:13.121
when it's actually even better
than when you taste it.

35:13.153 --> 35:17.124
- The joy of anticipation.
- I hope you experience

35:17.157 --> 35:19.259
as many more of
those moments as you want.

35:19.293 --> 35:21.262
I plan to.

35:21.295 --> 35:23.688
- Alright.
- Will I see you tomorrow?

35:24.298 --> 35:26.598
Oh, that's right, the Henderson Mill.

35:26.623 --> 35:28.202
I told Stephanie
I was gonna help her with

35:28.235 --> 35:29.237
the food for the wedding.

35:29.262 --> 35:31.305
And we're having a meeting where
the ceremony's going to be.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.208
- Do you want to drive out together?
- Yeah. That'd be great.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.410
- Okay. I'll see you then.
- Goodnight.

35:36.443 --> 35:38.646
Goodnight.

35:43.249 --> 35:46.454
- I really like her.
- I do, too.

35:46.487 --> 35:49.956
So, tell me, does this mean
you've changed your mind?

35:49.990 --> 35:51.597
About what?

35:51.622 --> 35:54.429
You said you never wanted
to get married again.

35:54.461 --> 35:58.598
I just know I don't want to
risk that kind of failure again.

35:59.133 --> 36:02.136
And I don't want to mess up
what Cassie and I have.

36:02.168 --> 36:04.604
So, yeah, I guess I still
feel the same way.

36:06.481 --> 36:08.008
That's too bad, then.

36:14.148 --> 36:16.324
Goodnight, Sam.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.286
Goodnight.

36:27.502 --> 36:29.097
Looks like you're all packed up.

36:29.130 --> 36:31.099
Yeah, we're ready to be on our way,

36:31.132 --> 36:34.718
although stopping off here was
exactly what this family needed.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.506
It's time to go home, Pavla.

36:38.539 --> 36:40.908
Can we play on the computer first?

36:40.941 --> 36:42.944
Mmm, I don't think that's working.

36:42.976 --> 36:45.245
I'm so sorry. I was hoping
to have this working

36:45.278 --> 36:47.188
before you guys left.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.482
Hmm...

36:52.353 --> 36:54.488
Oh, look at that.

36:54.521 --> 36:57.224
- This place looks like fun.
- What is it?

36:57.258 --> 37:00.026
Oh, it's Universal Orlando Resort.

37:00.059 --> 37:03.063
They have theme parks, and hotels,

37:03.097 --> 37:05.333
and a new water park called Volcano Bay.

37:05.365 --> 37:07.768
- Would you like to go there some time?
- Can we?

37:07.802 --> 37:08.918
Sure.

37:08.943 --> 37:10.338
But right now your parents
want to get you home

37:10.371 --> 37:13.340
and show you your new house
and your very own bed.

37:13.715 --> 37:16.978
I'm sure you'll have a wonderful
time together. As a family.

37:25.452 --> 37:29.189
Oh, I didn't realize
you were leaving today.

37:29.222 --> 37:31.191
Yeah. They're taking Pavla home.

37:31.224 --> 37:33.460
Thank you so much for all
you did with our daughter.

37:33.494 --> 37:35.578
She was pretty fun to have around.

37:36.071 --> 37:38.066
You really made a big
difference in her life.

37:48.876 --> 37:51.479
Thank you for finding me when
I was hiding with the towels.

37:52.253 --> 37:54.096
I'm glad I found you there, too.

37:54.129 --> 37:57.517
- Oh, and the earrings I borrowed?
- I put them back in your room.

37:57.550 --> 38:00.220
Yeah, but you know what?

38:06.193 --> 38:08.262
I think you should keep them.

38:09.270 --> 38:10.831
- Really?
- Mhm.

38:10.865 --> 38:12.565
Thanks!

38:22.476 --> 38:25.046
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:36.155 --> 38:38.125
(cheerful music)

38:45.365 --> 38:48.969
Everything about this place is perfect.

38:49.003 --> 38:53.507
We can set up the string quartet there and they
will play as the bride and groom walk out,

38:53.539 --> 38:57.688
and then we will follow down the
stairs to where we can serve dinner.

38:57.715 --> 38:59.684
Well, Joanne and I
have come up with some

38:59.717 --> 39:02.720
- really great international food.
- We're going to have

39:02.753 --> 39:06.190
Venezuelan meatballs ready for people
to snack on right when they get there.

39:06.224 --> 39:10.810
- You're going to be serving meatballs?!
- Yes, but they're Venezuelan...

39:10.843 --> 39:13.310
We need things to be much
more impressive than that.

39:13.335 --> 39:14.499
People are already

39:14.532 --> 39:17.339
going to be impressed simply
being in this venue.

39:17.372 --> 39:20.205
So we don't want to spoil it by
not going all-out with the food.

39:20.925 --> 39:24.743
Maybe it was a mistake to have the
local vendors do all of the work.

39:24.776 --> 39:27.078
These "local vendors"
can really come through.

39:27.110 --> 39:30.047
Well, I've hardly seen them
come through at all.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.584
We have to make some
last-minute changes.

39:33.617 --> 39:35.953
And in order to do that,
I have to let you go.

39:35.987 --> 39:38.756
There's just no way that
any of you can pull off

39:38.789 --> 39:40.825
the kind of wedding
that I'm asking for now.

39:41.362 --> 39:44.094
Now, I have some people
at home that I can contact

39:44.128 --> 39:47.999
and have them do the jobs,
instead. Martha,

39:48.032 --> 39:51.769
I feel like I've been
shirking my responsibility

39:51.802 --> 39:54.772
as mother of the bride by letting
you do so much of the work,

39:54.805 --> 39:57.541
so I think it's best
that I take over everything.

39:57.575 --> 40:01.246
- Everything?
- Well, I can use you as a helper.

40:01.278 --> 40:04.277
(strained chuckle)

40:04.310 --> 40:07.485
Now, I have to take a look out front.

40:07.519 --> 40:10.755
I've got an idea for an extra
special way for the bride

40:10.787 --> 40:13.257
to arrive and I need to
make sure there's room.

40:13.291 --> 40:16.160
Well, I suppose I should
inform the proprietor.

40:16.193 --> 40:19.965
I've got a whole pot of
Venezuelan meatballs to get rid of.

40:24.235 --> 40:26.704
They say that wedding planning
can be one of the most stressful

40:26.738 --> 40:30.108
- times in a couple's life.
- Yes, it can be a challenge.

40:30.141 --> 40:32.244
You know, maybe it's a good
thing you and my brother

40:32.276 --> 40:34.082
will never have to go through it.

40:34.644 --> 40:36.613
What do you mean?

40:36.638 --> 40:38.741
Oh, Sam not wanting
to get married again.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.686
Oh, Cassie, I'm sorry.

40:41.718 --> 40:44.688
I just figured that you already knew.

40:44.722 --> 40:48.627
No. Although I can understand
why he feels that way.

40:48.659 --> 40:51.262
I'm just surprised
I didn't figure it out.

40:51.296 --> 40:53.732
He really does love you.

40:53.764 --> 40:55.933
I do know that.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.106
Yeah. I love him, too.

40:59.399 --> 41:02.606
I should probably go find

41:02.639 --> 41:05.309
Stephanie. Make sure
I'm as fired as she is.

41:05.342 --> 41:07.812
Okay.

41:15.205 --> 41:18.474
(mystical music)
