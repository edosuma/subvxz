WEBVTT

00:03.922 --> 00:05.840
<i>It was the ultimate cliffhanger.</i>

00:06.049 --> 00:09.594
<i>Clifford Blossom had
killed himself. But why?</i>

00:09.803 --> 00:13.473
<i>Life's not an Agatha Christie
novel. It's a lot messier.</i>

00:13.682 --> 00:16.101
What the hell is Cliff Blossom
doing with drugs?

00:16.476 --> 00:20.230
<i>Turns out,
maple syrup was a front
for his true business.</i>

00:20.438 --> 00:23.108
<i>Transporting heroin from
Montreal on his trucks.</i>

00:24.317 --> 00:26.111
<i>A narrative quickly emerged.</i>

00:26.444 --> 00:29.614
<i>That Jason Blossom
learned about
dear old Dad's drug running,</i>

00:29.823 --> 00:31.783
<i>and threatened to expose
the truth.</i>

00:31.992 --> 00:33.493
<i>Which led to Jason's abduction</i>

00:33.702 --> 00:36.705
<i>at the hands of a Southside
Serpent named Mustang.</i>

00:36.913 --> 00:40.041
<i>And then to Jason's murder
at the hands of his father.</i>

00:40.709 --> 00:42.752
<i>Clifford killed
Mustang to cover his tracks,</i>

00:42.961 --> 00:44.879
<i>making it look like
he'd overdosed,</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:47.048
<i>and tried to implicate
a rival businessman,</i>

00:47.257 --> 00:50.885
<i>Hiram Lodge, as having
masterminded the whole thing.</i>

00:51.094 --> 00:53.555
<i>And, oh, yeah,
I almost forgot.</i>

00:53.763 --> 00:55.473
<i>Mr. Blossom threatened
my life,</i>

00:55.682 --> 00:58.309
<i>so that my dad would confess
to pulling the trigger,</i>

00:58.518 --> 01:00.854
<i>even though all he did
was clean up the mess.</i>

01:01.062 --> 01:02.397
Here you go, Juggy.

01:02.605 --> 01:04.315
<i>And he would have
gotten away with it, too,</i>

01:04.524 --> 01:07.736
<i>if it wasn't for
a group of pesky kids
who uncovered the truth.</i>

01:07.944 --> 01:11.281
<i>Even as Clifford Blossom,
consumed by guilt and shame,</i>

01:11.489 --> 01:12.782
<i>took the coward's way out...</i>

01:12.991 --> 01:15.326
<i>Jason's murder
had revealed some dark truths</i>

01:15.535 --> 01:17.537
<i>none of us were
too eager to face.</i>

01:17.746 --> 01:19.372
<i>Especially not Mayor McCoy,</i>

01:19.581 --> 01:22.792
<i>who wanted every last vestige
of corruption crushed</i>

01:23.001 --> 01:25.712
<i>like a snake
under a boot heel.</i>

01:25.920 --> 01:27.881
So, Blossom was the kingpin,

01:28.089 --> 01:30.592
he funneled drugs
through Riverdale and
then shipped them out.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.305
What the Mayor and I care
about is the local component
of Blossom's business.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.308
Someone is selling his drugs
here in Riverdale.

01:38.516 --> 01:40.018
- Mostly in the Southside...
- Hmm.

01:40.226 --> 01:42.479
...but it's started to cross
the tracks, recently, too.

01:42.687 --> 01:45.190
- And you think
it's the Serpents?
- Who else?

01:45.398 --> 01:46.691
So here's the deal.

01:47.859 --> 01:51.362
You feed us names,
tell me who's pushing
the dope,

01:51.571 --> 01:53.698
and the Mayor, the DA
have a chat,

01:53.907 --> 01:56.201
and maybe he'd be inclined
to offer you a
lesser sentence.

01:56.409 --> 01:58.119
Serpents don't get into
the hard stuff.

01:58.328 --> 01:59.746
It's dime bags of weed.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.414
And I'm no snitch.

02:02.707 --> 02:07.879
FP, if you don't help us
and your case goes to trial,

02:08.088 --> 02:09.214
there will be no leniency.

02:09.422 --> 02:12.175
You'll be looking at 20 years
in a federal penitentiary

02:12.383 --> 02:14.844
for your part in the cover-up
of Jason Blossom's murder.

02:26.981 --> 02:27.982
Dad?

02:29.984 --> 02:30.944
You okay?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.613
I thought I knew this town.

02:34.405 --> 02:35.782
I bet everything on it.

02:37.909 --> 02:39.661
If I could cut bait...

02:41.412 --> 02:42.622
How are you holding up?

02:43.289 --> 02:44.916
I mean, I'm...
I'm dealing.

02:45.917 --> 02:49.170
But for Jughead and
for Betty and Veronica,
Dad, it's not over.

02:49.379 --> 02:51.339
They're still in it. Big time.

02:55.802 --> 02:59.013
We're all still in it.
Up to our necks.

03:02.642 --> 03:04.352
<i>And when should
I be expecting Mr. Lodge?</i>

03:04.561 --> 03:06.980
Not until the end of
the month, but everything
has to be perfect.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.732
Yes, we would not want
to make Daddy angry.

03:09.941 --> 03:11.401
That'll be all, Smithers.
Thank you.

03:16.114 --> 03:18.867
He's your father, Veronica,
not the Godfather.

03:22.328 --> 03:26.291
<i>They're acting like
the last week and the last few
months didn't even happen.</i>

03:26.499 --> 03:28.877
<i>Polly's back home,
my dad's back home,</i>

03:29.085 --> 03:30.545
<i>my mom's back at</i> The Register.

03:30.753 --> 03:35.633
<i>They all just keep smiling
and talking about the Jubilee.</i>

03:35.842 --> 03:37.343
- That's good, right?
- No.

03:37.552 --> 03:39.304
No, it's horrible.

03:39.512 --> 03:44.642
It's exactly the way things
were before, pretending to
be normal and perfect

03:44.851 --> 03:49.230
when really, we're like...
Like a Greek suburban tragedy.

03:52.483 --> 03:55.153
My family imploded, Arch,

03:55.361 --> 03:57.405
and we barely survived.

03:57.614 --> 04:00.658
If we don't start dealing
with our crap, it's all
gonna happen again.

04:02.994 --> 04:04.287
<i>Okay, Archie.</i>

04:04.495 --> 04:07.332
Now that we're not actively
investigating a murder case,

04:07.540 --> 04:10.335
we need to come clean to Betty
about our pas de deux.

04:10.543 --> 04:12.545
- What?
- Our romance.

04:12.754 --> 04:15.381
Aw, definitely. But, Ronnie,
we have to be careful.

04:15.590 --> 04:18.343
The last time I had this
kind of conversation with
Betty, it didn't go well.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.220
Forget it, I'll tell her.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.930
On top of everything else
I'm dealing with right now,

04:22.138 --> 04:23.806
I'll tell Betty that
we're semi-dating.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.433
<i>Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper,</i>

04:25.642 --> 04:27.227
<i>report to
the Principal's office.</i>

04:28.061 --> 04:30.355
Archie. Betty.

04:30.563 --> 04:32.398
I'd like to feature you both
at the Jubilee.

04:32.607 --> 04:35.777
As you know,
it's our 75th anniversary
of our town's founding,

04:35.985 --> 04:38.905
and also a kickoff for
the next 75 years.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.699
And who better represents
the future of Riverdale

04:41.908 --> 04:46.704
than the young people
who, working with Sheriff
Keller and my office,

04:46.913 --> 04:50.792
helped bring peace and justice
to our streets once more?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.086
But, that's not exactly
what happened...

04:53.294 --> 04:55.004
Let the Mayor finish,
Ms. Cooper.

04:55.213 --> 04:58.132
Archie, the Pussycats
will be performing
at the Jubilee,

04:58.341 --> 05:00.718
and I would love for you
to join them.

05:00.927 --> 05:05.890
Betty, I think it's important
that we hear from Riverdale's
best and brightest.

05:06.099 --> 05:07.684
- What do you say, both of you?
- Uh...

05:07.892 --> 05:09.227
What about Jughead?

05:10.353 --> 05:13.564
I, uh... I like Jughead.

05:13.773 --> 05:17.235
And he's welcome to attend
the Jubilee, of course.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.904
But his father is in jail,

05:20.113 --> 05:22.198
and think it might
be confusing

05:22.407 --> 05:23.741
to have him up
on the Jubilee stage.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.035
That's so unfair, Mayor McCoy.

05:26.244 --> 05:30.498
Betty, Archie, you're heroes.

05:30.707 --> 05:33.376
The kind of heroes
that Riverdale desperately

05:33.584 --> 05:34.794
needs right about now.

05:38.089 --> 05:39.340
<i>I told her I wouldn't do it.</i>

05:39.549 --> 05:41.592
Not unless you're
up there with us, Jug.

05:41.801 --> 05:44.429
I appreciate the righteous
indignation, Betty, I do,

05:44.637 --> 05:46.222
but Jubilees aren't my thing.

05:46.431 --> 05:47.974
Jug, how's your dad?
Did you get in to see him?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.767
Here's the latest.

05:49.976 --> 05:52.020
Mayor McCoy wants
my dad to name names

05:52.228 --> 05:53.563
in exchange for
a lesser sentence.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.231
What? Whose names?

05:55.440 --> 05:57.567
The Serpents. Sheriff Keller
thinks they're the ones

05:57.775 --> 05:59.652
dealing the drugs that
Clifford Blossom brought
into the town.

05:59.861 --> 06:02.572
My dad says more and more
drugs are hitting the streets.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.241
Kevin, relax,
this isn't <i>The Wire.</i>

06:05.992 --> 06:08.077
My dad says they're
not the ones dealing.

06:08.703 --> 06:11.414
And meanwhile, Mayor McCoy
hasn't even said the words

06:11.622 --> 06:13.624
"Clifford" or "Blossom"
in public.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.502
It's all about how
the Serpents are the problem,
the villains.

06:16.711 --> 06:17.879
This is outrageous.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.464
I'm writing an article
about this,

06:19.672 --> 06:21.382
and not just for
<i>The Blue and Gold,</i>
for <i>The Register.</i>

06:21.591 --> 06:23.051
This is a town story.

06:23.259 --> 06:24.844
Okay, as long as the article
doesn't include my dad.

06:25.053 --> 06:27.263
No, it is going to be
about your dad, Jug.

06:27.472 --> 06:31.684
It doesn't matter how many
Jubilees Mayor McCoy throws.

06:31.893 --> 06:35.772
This town's changed.
That needs to be acknowledged.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.815
Why are people
so afraid of the truth?

06:38.691 --> 06:41.069
Speaking of the truth...

06:43.321 --> 06:45.990
Archie and I wanted
to tell you...

06:49.619 --> 06:50.995
We've kissed a couple
of times.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.540
It's okay, Vee.

06:54.749 --> 06:56.834
I appreciate you
being honest with me,

06:57.043 --> 06:58.169
but I'm with Jughead now.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.839
If you guys want
to be together,
I'm happy for you.

07:02.382 --> 07:03.966
Thanks, Bee.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.051
Thanks, Betty.

07:09.722 --> 07:14.268
It was to have been
the grandest funeral
in Riverdale history.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.647
Instead, he was buried
like a pauper.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.567
Why are you crying?
You hated him.

07:24.153 --> 07:26.864
Don't...
Don't say that, Mommy...

07:27.865 --> 07:29.492
We've always been cursed

07:29.700 --> 07:33.079
ever since the original murder
when brother killed brother.

07:34.122 --> 07:37.708
Who will the Grim Reaper
take next? You? Me?

07:39.252 --> 07:42.088
Maybe your father had
the right idea. Just end it.

07:42.296 --> 07:47.718
Better the sweet hereafter
than this awful limbo.

08:05.111 --> 08:07.780
Betty, I know you said you were
okay about me and Veronica,

08:07.989 --> 08:09.574
but I just wanted to make
sure, because...

08:09.782 --> 08:13.286
Because last time I said
I was okay, I wasn't.

08:13.494 --> 08:17.582
But this time,
I promise I am.

08:17.790 --> 08:18.749
Great.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.879
You and Veronica, you're...

08:23.421 --> 08:26.132
I like her, a lot.
She's amazing.

08:30.928 --> 08:33.181
But a little part of me
always thought...

08:33.389 --> 08:34.932
We're both so lucky.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.853
I mean, don't you think?

08:39.061 --> 08:42.190
To have found the people
that we were meant to be with.

08:42.398 --> 08:44.233
And that we're all friends.

08:45.485 --> 08:46.736
I mean,
who would have thought,

08:46.944 --> 08:48.613
at the beginning
of the school year?

08:49.447 --> 08:51.324
Yeah.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.117
Who would have thought?

08:57.246 --> 08:58.873
You wanna tell me
who those guys are out there?

08:59.081 --> 09:00.750
Our new crew.
I let the Serpents go.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.502
You fired them?
Why would you do that?

09:02.710 --> 09:04.545
The Mayor and Sheriff Keller
are cracking down.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.172
Especially on the Serpents.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.091
Those guys stood by us, okay?
When we had no one else.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.093
Hiram is coming home.

09:11.302 --> 09:13.262
I can't let him,
or this project,

09:13.471 --> 09:14.764
be associated with criminals.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.724
You don't get to make
unilateral decisions.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.559
'Cause we're partners,
remember?

09:21.062 --> 09:23.648
Actually,
Hiram and I have talked,

09:23.856 --> 09:26.359
and we'd like to buy you out.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.487
Fred.

09:30.196 --> 09:33.366
I've dragged you into
a situation that you never
wanted to be a part of.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.162
Make me an offer in writing.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.498
I'll consider it.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.169
It's really good, Archie.

09:45.378 --> 09:46.921
Each song, you're getting
better and better.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.674
- That's great, Josie.
- Yeah.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.050
'Cause I was hoping
we could...

09:51.259 --> 09:52.677
Oh, we can't sing it
at the Jubilee.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.097
No, my mom already
approved <i>Astronaut.</i>

09:56.305 --> 09:58.891
- But my song is about...
- Your friends.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.227
Who've been through
hell and back, I get it.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.771
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah. So...

10:04.689 --> 10:06.399
The Jubilee, that's for
the entire town.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.192
Not just your friends.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.786
It's the best thing
you've ever written.

10:20.121 --> 10:22.832
It's passionate,
it's compelling, but...

10:23.040 --> 10:24.000
But you won't publish it.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.045
- Why not?
- You're too involved.

10:28.254 --> 10:29.338
People out there
are going to think

10:29.547 --> 10:31.340
that you wrote it as a favor
to your boyfriend's dad.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.050
No, I wrote it
because this is the truth.

10:33.259 --> 10:34.594
It's one version
of the truth, honey.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.637
Oh, my God. Mom.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.764
You're just as bad
as Mayor McCoy.

10:38.973 --> 10:40.850
We're just as bad
as this whole town.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.103
The other reason
we don't want you
publishing this anywhere,

10:44.312 --> 10:47.356
- is there's been reports
of attacks on the Southside.
- What?

10:47.565 --> 10:50.067
Betty, people,
not just the police,

10:50.276 --> 10:51.694
are going after the Serpents.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.113
The whole town agrees
with Mayor McCoy.

10:54.322 --> 10:56.032
Crime is spreading.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.867
There's real anger
out there, Betty.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.910
And they're needing
to focus it somewhere.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.371
Right now, it's the Serpents,

11:02.580 --> 11:04.874
and we don't want you
suddenly becoming a target.

11:09.545 --> 11:12.715
Cheryl, I'm so sorry I'm late.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.634
All you missed
was my abdication.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.218
The Vixens are in the gym

11:16.427 --> 11:18.721
awaiting you,
their new directorix.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.349
- What?
- And I wanted
to give you this.

11:23.434 --> 11:25.102
Your HBIC shirt?

11:25.311 --> 11:27.021
These last few days have
put things in perspective.

11:28.648 --> 11:29.732
I understand.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.235
But if you personally
need anything...

11:33.444 --> 11:34.737
I'm fine.

11:36.656 --> 11:38.699
I've shed my tears
for the Blossom men.

11:41.494 --> 11:43.079
It was chilling, Betty.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.915
I'm telling you,
there are some dark
goings on at Thornhill.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.084
Well, not just at Thornhill.
Town wide.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.087
You can feel it. Something
wicked this way comes.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.923
Which reminds me,
I loved your article.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.383
Good, because
I already posted it

11:55.591 --> 11:57.510
on the <i>Blue and Gold's</i>
website,

11:57.718 --> 12:00.554
with hardcopies in circulation
tomorrow morning.

12:01.347 --> 12:04.350
Betty, now that
it's just us girls,

12:04.558 --> 12:06.852
and at the risk of us
failing the Bechdel test,

12:07.061 --> 12:09.772
are you legitimately cool
with Archie and me?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.232
Swear on the September issue?

12:11.440 --> 12:14.318
And on my copy of <i>Forever</i>
by Judy Blume.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.572
Aw, I miss this.

12:18.781 --> 12:22.326
Gossiping, doing homework,
being a River Vixen.

12:22.952 --> 12:24.286
Basically just going
to school.

12:24.495 --> 12:25.329
Then come back.

12:25.538 --> 12:26.664
Mom doesn't want me to.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.583
Naturally, but what she
doesn't know won't hurt her.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.256
That hottie kept
looking at you.

12:36.841 --> 12:38.467
Hey, guys. Um...

12:39.343 --> 12:41.387
This is Ms. Weiss
from Social Services.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.140
She's, uh...
She's Jughead's case worker.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.017
Jughead, I know how
terrible and emotional

12:47.226 --> 12:48.853
the last few days
have been for you.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.313
Your father's facing
serious jail time.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.607
Your mom's over-extended
and out of state.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.860
We just want to make sure
that you're taken care of.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.653
Well, he can keep staying
with us, right, Dad?

12:57.862 --> 12:59.989
I offered already, Arch.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.198
Great, so what's the problem?

13:01.407 --> 13:03.701
It was a DUI.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.495
After your mom left.
Look, we can talk
about this later

13:06.704 --> 13:11.250
but between that
and my cash flow problem,
it knocks me out.

13:12.460 --> 13:15.337
There is a family on
the Southside that's
offered to foster you.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.506
They're good people,
they've worked with us before.

13:17.715 --> 13:19.967
That doesn't sound
completely horrible.

13:20.176 --> 13:23.429
It does mean
you'll be in a different
school district, Jughead,

13:23.637 --> 13:25.222
and you'll have to
transfer schools.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.141
What the hell?
When is all this
supposed to happen?

13:27.349 --> 13:28.893
The paperwork's
been processed.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.729
Unless there is a radical
change in your father's case,

13:31.937 --> 13:33.981
you'll be on the Southside
by the end of the week.

13:44.617 --> 13:47.953
They're saying he has
to live on the Southside,
with a foster family,

13:48.162 --> 13:50.080
and then transfer
to Southside High.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.875
That place is no joke.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.419
If there's a deal on
the table, Mr. Jones,
you've gotta take it.

13:55.628 --> 13:58.547
It tears me up, Red,
but the Serpents are my tribe.

13:58.756 --> 14:00.591
They're also innocent,
not that anyone
in this town cares.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.219
We care, believe me.
But...

14:04.178 --> 14:06.555
Nobody wants you
to go to jail for 20 years,
especially not Jughead.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.474
That kid knows what's what.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.143
He knows you can't betray
the folks that stand by you.

14:11.936 --> 14:13.729
- Who got your back.
- And that's the Serpents?

14:13.938 --> 14:15.481
When the time comes,
they'll step up.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.443
Hey, Jughead's a tough kid.

14:20.486 --> 14:22.279
Scrappy. A survivor.

14:23.781 --> 14:24.782
He'll make it.

14:26.242 --> 14:27.993
Especially if you're looking
after him.

14:28.202 --> 14:29.870
And he'll try to pull
away from you,

14:31.288 --> 14:33.332
he'll try to disappear
into himself.

14:33.958 --> 14:35.543
He needs his friends.

14:35.751 --> 14:39.004
That's why you and Betty,
you gotta stick with him.

14:39.505 --> 14:40.506
No matter what.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.800
He's got some darkness in him.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.472
Betty's babysitting Polly,
mind if I join you?

14:48.681 --> 14:51.100
Are you sure you want to sit
at the social pariah table?

14:52.560 --> 14:55.312
I've been sitting at it
for months, why should
today be any different?

14:56.647 --> 14:58.274
By the way,
I've been thinking.

14:58.482 --> 14:59.650
You and I have a lot
in common.

14:59.859 --> 15:03.070
Oh, because my dad's
going to prison and
your dad is getting out?

15:03.279 --> 15:05.781
We're dating
each other's best friends,
I was going to say.

15:05.990 --> 15:08.200
But yes,
the prison thing, too.

15:09.159 --> 15:09.869
Jughead.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.037
I'm sorry.

15:12.705 --> 15:14.832
I had no right to pummel you
the way I did that day.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.085
As recompense,
I'd like to give you this.

15:20.838 --> 15:21.964
My iconic spider brooch.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.885
It'll catch a pretty penny
at the local pawn shop.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.679
Enough to keep you in burgers
and "S" T-shirts for years,

15:28.888 --> 15:30.097
if not decades.

15:30.306 --> 15:32.016
Cheryl, what is going on?

15:33.517 --> 15:35.477
- I'm...
Guys, hurry.
It's Betty's locker.

15:35.686 --> 15:37.229
Come on, it's bad.
Come on, come on!

15:39.607 --> 15:40.733
What's going on?

15:40.941 --> 15:41.984
Come with us.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.822
Check it out!

15:55.122 --> 15:55.831
Betty.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.626
Betty. Hey, no...

15:58.834 --> 16:01.086
It's nothing, Jug,
it's just a jerk with
a can of spray paint.

16:01.295 --> 16:03.297
I don't think that's
spray paint, okay?

16:07.468 --> 16:09.470
<i>It was pig's blood, Dad.</i>

16:09.678 --> 16:11.013
Where do you even
get pig's blood?

16:11.221 --> 16:13.265
I wanna slam whoever
did that through a wall.

16:13.474 --> 16:16.435
Betty's getting threats.
Jughead is being thrown
into a snake pit,

16:16.644 --> 16:17.895
and I can't do anything
to help them.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.438
Sometimes you help them
just by showing up.

16:19.647 --> 16:21.899
I've been showing up
all year, Dad.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.652
And it hasn't made
one bit of difference.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.655
We're getting
our asses kicked.

16:29.198 --> 16:32.368
As long as you're with me,
you're writing articles
about me and my dad,

16:32.576 --> 16:34.787
trouble's just gonna
keep coming at you
from all sides.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.290
- It was just one jerk.
- It's not just one jerk.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.876
It's Mayor McCoy.
It's Sheriff Keller.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.171
It's Weatherbee,
it's Social Services,

16:44.338 --> 16:47.132
it's the entire
multiverse telling me
that I don't belong here,

16:47.341 --> 16:49.259
- so why don't I just do
everyone a favour...
- Hey, hey.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.722
You belong here just
as much as everyone else.

16:53.931 --> 16:54.974
This is your home.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.435
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.272
Yes.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.159
Let me guess, for Daddy?

17:15.077 --> 17:16.370
Veronica, wait.

17:18.664 --> 17:19.915
You and Archie...

17:20.791 --> 17:21.750
Getting closer?

17:22.710 --> 17:24.503
Maybe, why do you ask?

17:25.546 --> 17:27.631
Your father and I made
Fred an offer

17:27.840 --> 17:29.675
to buy out the
SoDale contract,

17:29.883 --> 17:31.468
but Fred is still
on the fence about it.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.848
I was hoping maybe
you could talk to Archie.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.308
Maybe he could convince
Fred to sell?

17:39.810 --> 17:41.478
Yeah, sure, Mom. No problem.

17:41.687 --> 17:44.148
I'll just sexually manipulate
Archie into doing my bidding.

17:44.732 --> 17:45.816
As long as you're in control.

17:47.359 --> 17:49.236
Oh, my God, Mom,
I was kidding.

17:49.403 --> 17:53.282
Also, why are you trying
to push Fred out of this deal?

17:53.490 --> 17:56.243
He's the only person
in this town who was loyal.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.620
- Who was good to you.
- Your father is coming back.

17:59.121 --> 18:02.041
He and Fred?
They will not get along.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.591
- So, you took Polly to school?
- I'm so sorry, Betty.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.052
Nothing happened at school,
it was fine.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.136
Fine?

18:14.344 --> 18:15.721
So, no one wrote
on your locker,

18:15.929 --> 18:17.306
"Go to hell, Serpent Slut,"

18:17.514 --> 18:19.308
and hung a Betty doll
from a noose?

18:19.516 --> 18:20.684
Jeez, Poll. Is there anything
you didn't tell her?

18:20.893 --> 18:22.102
She wouldn't stop grilling me!

18:22.311 --> 18:24.646
I warned you, Elizabeth,
about publishing that article.

18:24.855 --> 18:27.316
- Why do you
constantly defy me?
- Because.

18:27.524 --> 18:32.321
I'm sick of all the secrets
and the lies in this town
and in this family.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.948
I would much rather take
some heat for being honest

18:35.157 --> 18:36.492
than do what you're doing.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.660
Living in fear of the truth.

18:38.869 --> 18:42.414
I am scared for you,
Elizabeth, not of the truth.

18:42.623 --> 18:43.957
Oh, really?

18:46.210 --> 18:47.294
Let's go then.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.464
You talk a big game
about liking Jughead,

18:50.672 --> 18:52.382
but wouldn't you
be much happier if
we weren't together?

18:54.718 --> 18:55.677
Thought so.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.763
Question number two,

18:57.971 --> 18:59.389
when you invited FP
over for dinner,

18:59.598 --> 19:01.183
he said that you and Dad
got in a huge fight

19:01.391 --> 19:02.976
when you were in high school,
at Homecoming.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.436
Your mom ever tell you
about that night?

19:04.645 --> 19:05.979
Shut up, FP.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.107
- What was that about?
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.567
Oh, come on, Mom.
I saw the look on your face.

19:10.776 --> 19:12.402
You were terrified.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.862
What were you so scared
he was going to say?

19:14.071 --> 19:16.073
That is none of your
damn business!

19:23.413 --> 19:27.126
Dad was keeping a secret
that almost destroyed us.

19:28.544 --> 19:30.295
How many are you keeping?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.343
<i>Mommy, I was going to ask.</i>

19:37.845 --> 19:39.304
Can I stay at home today?

19:39.513 --> 19:41.098
Absolutely not.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.518
It's so hard, Mommy,
pretending everything's...

19:44.726 --> 19:47.312
I don't care.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.826
Here for round two?

20:02.953 --> 20:06.331
There are some secrets
that are so painful,

20:07.082 --> 20:08.709
you not only hide them
from the world,

20:08.917 --> 20:10.878
but you hide them
from yourself.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.298
What do you mean?

20:14.506 --> 20:19.219
The night of the Homecoming,

20:19.428 --> 20:23.056
when your father and I
were crowned King and Queen,

20:23.265 --> 20:24.892
the fight that FP saw,

20:27.144 --> 20:29.646
I had just told your father
that I was pregnant.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.529
And we disagreed
on how best to handle...

20:39.239 --> 20:39.865
Things.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.410
And we had a really big fight.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.079
And the next day, I went away.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.497
To the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

20:47.706 --> 20:48.832
Yeah.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.294
And five months later,
your brother was born.

20:53.378 --> 20:56.757
The Sisters arranged
for a quiet adoption.

21:00.761 --> 21:04.056
Oh, my God, Mom. I'm so sorry.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.351
It's the biggest regret
of my life.

21:09.603 --> 21:14.024
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, honey.

21:14.233 --> 21:15.984
It's okay, Mom.

21:17.527 --> 21:21.615
The craziest thing is,
I have a secret brother
out there in the world.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.618
It's positively Dickensian.
I love a long-lost brother.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.162
- How old would he be?
- Mid-twenties.

21:27.371 --> 21:29.414
Oh, my God.
A blond Adonis, no doubt.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.879
Hey, where are you?
Have you been getting
my messages?

21:38.257 --> 21:39.216
Oh, my God. What?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.928
This is where I belong, okay?

21:43.971 --> 21:45.847
Let's talk about this
after school.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.349
Please don't worry about me.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.694
- Where is he?
- Southside High.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.654
He said it's
where he belongs

22:00.862 --> 22:02.322
and that no one
wants him here.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.616
FP warned me
Jughead would cut himself off,

22:04.825 --> 22:05.993
go to the dark side.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.828
Archie, we can't
let him do that.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.152
Where would he be?

22:40.986 --> 22:42.154
Cafeteria.

22:52.289 --> 22:53.915
Jug...

22:55.542 --> 22:56.835
What are you guys doing here?

23:00.922 --> 23:02.257
I didn't tell you
ahead of time

23:02.466 --> 23:03.675
because I knew you
would've tried to stop me.

23:03.884 --> 23:06.011
Damn straight.
And I'm still gonna try.

23:06.219 --> 23:10.098
Betty, the Southside is where
the powers that be want me.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.352
Maybe I wanna
be here as well.
I may blend in better here.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.145
And it would keep you safe.

23:15.354 --> 23:18.774
I'm not letting Riverdale's
civil war split us apart, Jug.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.740
They're each other's
soulmates.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.242
Good for them,
don't you think?

23:31.536 --> 23:33.789
Archie, what is it?

23:36.750 --> 23:37.959
Ronnie, I...

23:38.168 --> 23:39.419
Wait.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.010
- Oh, my God.
- What?

23:47.219 --> 23:48.470
Where would Cheryl go
to be with Jason?

23:48.678 --> 23:50.597
- Sweetwater River.
- We have to go!

23:51.223 --> 23:52.724
Guys, we have to go!

23:53.600 --> 23:54.559
Cheryl?

23:55.394 --> 23:56.728
Cheryl?

23:59.106 --> 24:00.399
Cheryl?

24:05.112 --> 24:06.405
She's not here.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.825
- Over there! Oh, my God.
- She's over there!

24:10.033 --> 24:11.284
Cheryl!

24:11.451 --> 24:13.328
Cheryl, stop!
What are you doing?

24:13.537 --> 24:15.163
Wait, wait! Wait, Jug!

24:16.123 --> 24:18.208
The ice. He's right.

24:18.417 --> 24:19.626
Too much weight,
and we'll all go under.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.044
Cheryl!

24:21.837 --> 24:22.963
Cheryl, please.

24:30.429 --> 24:33.390
Just come to the shore
and we'll figure this out
together, okay?

24:38.770 --> 24:39.396
No!

24:39.604 --> 24:40.772
Cheryl!

24:44.734 --> 24:45.694
Cheryl!

24:46.653 --> 24:47.779
- Cheryl!
- Cheryl!

24:52.826 --> 24:54.035
The current has her.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.872
Spread out, spread out!

25:04.754 --> 25:06.298
She's here! She's here!

25:09.468 --> 25:11.303
- Archie, be careful!
- Help!

25:12.304 --> 25:13.638
Somebody help!

25:32.699 --> 25:34.075
Archie!

25:36.369 --> 25:38.538
Come on!

26:11.863 --> 26:13.156
Cheryl!

26:29.965 --> 26:30.632
Hey.

26:31.675 --> 26:32.968
Hot chocolate?

26:34.511 --> 26:37.013
With a little splash
of peppermint liqueur.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.807
- Thank you.
- No problem.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.059
Are you warm enough?

26:42.936 --> 26:44.646
What is she doing here?

26:51.486 --> 26:53.113
She got in an accident.

26:53.530 --> 26:56.324
And she needed help,
so I brought her here.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.410
I'll just warm up and go home.

27:01.121 --> 27:02.497
Fine, Ronnie.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.791
Let's go. I'll give you
a ride to the Jubilee.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.878
Already got one with
Archie, Lady Macbeth.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.272
- Ready, sweetheart?
- Almost.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.613
Don't be nervous
about your speech.

27:35.155 --> 27:37.324
Just be your wonderful self.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.160
It's not about
the speech, Mom.

27:41.870 --> 27:43.204
It's Jughead.

27:45.540 --> 27:48.501
He's moving in
with a foster family

27:50.128 --> 27:52.088
and transferring
to Southside High.

27:53.923 --> 27:56.843
And he says it won't change
anything between us,

27:57.052 --> 27:57.969
but...

27:59.971 --> 28:02.057
It will.

28:11.107 --> 28:13.193
That's what you get
for punching a river of ice.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.153
Are you sure you
should be performing?

28:15.945 --> 28:18.448
Freshman year,
I played the whole season
with a broken hand.

28:18.657 --> 28:19.908
Well, a taped-up hand.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.870
Hey. You okay?

28:25.372 --> 28:27.040
When we were
at Southside High,

28:28.416 --> 28:31.211
you were looking
at Betty and Jughead...

28:32.212 --> 28:33.505
I don't know, wistfully.

28:34.005 --> 28:35.799
- Wistfully?
- Longingly.

28:36.341 --> 28:39.219
Like you liked Betty.

28:40.136 --> 28:42.263
I do. I always will.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.099
As friends.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.643
The moment
you're talking about,

28:49.020 --> 28:51.272
I was seeing Betty and Jughead

28:51.481 --> 28:53.191
and I was seeing
how good they were,

28:54.651 --> 28:57.612
and it confirmed how I've
been feeling this last week.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.031
I want to be that for you.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.576
A soulmate?

29:04.994 --> 29:07.956
A broad shoulder I can cry on
every now and then?

29:09.416 --> 29:10.583
Yeah.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.170
I'd love that, Archie.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.101
Earlier,
your girl Vee, here,

29:28.309 --> 29:30.270
called to tell me
what happened with Cheryl.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.773
I've reconsidered something.

29:34.357 --> 29:35.942
About your song.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.652
<i>Welcome, one and all,</i>

29:37.861 --> 29:42.157
<i>to Riverdale's
75th anniversary
Jubilee celebration!</i>

29:46.327 --> 29:49.205
I couldn't be any more
thrilled to introduce

29:49.414 --> 29:52.500
my daughter, Josie,
and her Pussycats,

29:52.709 --> 29:58.006
as they perform alongside our
local hero, Archie Andrews!

30:04.012 --> 30:05.555
Hi, hi, everyone.

30:05.764 --> 30:07.307
We're switching things
up tonight.

30:07.515 --> 30:12.520
We are singing a song
that my boy,
Archie Andrews, wrote.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.191
So...

30:27.869 --> 30:31.247
<i>♪ Every moment we're together</i>

30:34.793 --> 30:38.713
<i>♪ Is a moment I remember</i>

30:39.631 --> 30:42.509
Sheriff Keller
tells me that you still
haven't given any names.

30:42.717 --> 30:44.219
He's hoping I can
convince you otherwise.

30:44.427 --> 30:46.721
I've been sweating it out,
Jug, and, uh,

30:46.930 --> 30:51.226
the only conclusion
I've come to is
that both options suck.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.563
Hey, I wanted to
let you know that I...

30:57.774 --> 30:58.817
I'm gonna be okay.

31:00.401 --> 31:02.695
I met the foster family
that's taking me in.

31:03.905 --> 31:04.906
They're nice.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.702
What about Southside High?

31:10.703 --> 31:11.871
It's a high school.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.835
It's got the jocks,
and the burnouts,
and the nerds... The like.

31:17.043 --> 31:20.088
- But I'll survive.
- You just might.

31:25.176 --> 31:26.344
Jughead, listen to me.

31:26.553 --> 31:29.305
I'm more innocent
than I am guilty,

31:29.514 --> 31:31.140
but I've done some...

31:31.349 --> 31:33.935
Some stupid things,
some bad things,

31:34.143 --> 31:36.145
and come what may,

31:36.354 --> 31:39.107
I have to answer for my part
of it, you understand?

31:39.315 --> 31:41.860
I don't know what's
gonna happen when
this goes to trial,

31:43.069 --> 31:44.487
but you need to be there

31:44.696 --> 31:47.073
for your mom, for Jellybean.

31:47.282 --> 31:48.783
They might not need you
right this second...

31:48.992 --> 31:50.577
I'll do my best.

31:53.037 --> 31:54.414
Not a doubt in my mind.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.419
Go on.

32:05.383 --> 32:08.803
<i>♪ My love, my heart</i>

32:09.012 --> 32:12.473
<i>♪ I wanna share it with you</i>

32:12.682 --> 32:15.977
<i>♪ When it seems too hard
to bear</i>

32:16.185 --> 32:18.897
<i>♪ I'll be here, I'll be there</i>

32:19.480 --> 32:23.192
<i>♪ I wanna share it with you</i>

32:26.029 --> 32:31.034
<i>♪ I wanna share it with you ♪</i>

32:46.090 --> 32:47.383
Good evening,
ladies and gentleman.

32:48.176 --> 32:52.764
I'd like to thank Mayor McCoy
for inviting me to speak
on this historic day.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.849
Seventy-five years
of Riverdale...

33:02.440 --> 33:03.775
But what is Riverdale?

33:04.734 --> 33:06.778
It's the people, right?

33:06.986 --> 33:09.989
You, me, our friends,
our neighbors.

33:13.117 --> 33:14.953
Riverdale is Archie Andrews.

33:17.956 --> 33:19.624
Kevin Keller is Riverdale.

33:20.416 --> 33:23.086
Veronica Lodge,
she's Riverdale.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.714
But you know who else
is Riverdale?

33:27.966 --> 33:29.258
FP Jones,

33:29.884 --> 33:33.262
who we were so quick
to blame for Jason's murder.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.726
Jughead Jones is Riverdale,

33:38.935 --> 33:40.895
the very soul of Riverdale.

33:41.104 --> 33:43.648
Without him,
we may not have ever found out

33:43.856 --> 33:45.316
what happened to Jason.

33:45.525 --> 33:48.194
And yet how do we thank him?
By banishing him.

33:48.403 --> 33:51.572
Which is what we do
when the truth gets
too ugly in Riverdale.

33:51.781 --> 33:54.826
Truth being that Clifford
Blossom was also Riverdale.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.036
Riverdale's at a crossroads.

33:57.245 --> 33:59.914
If we don't face the reality
of who and what we are,

34:00.123 --> 34:03.584
if we keep lying to ourselves
and keeping secrets
from each other,

34:03.793 --> 34:06.212
then what happened to Jason
could happen again.

34:06.421 --> 34:08.256
Or, God forbid,
something even worse.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.466
Riverdale must do better.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.635
We must do better.

34:46.836 --> 34:47.712
Fred.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.673
Have you given any more
thought to my offer?

34:50.882 --> 34:53.551
Yes, it is a, uh,
very generous offer.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.012
I'm not selling, Hermione.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.515
I... I told you,
it's in your best interest
to get out

34:59.724 --> 35:01.184
before Hiram comes back.

35:01.392 --> 35:02.852
Is it in your best interests?

35:03.061 --> 35:05.229
What's best for the town?
Didn't you hear Betty?

35:05.438 --> 35:08.357
Riverdale is at a crossroads,
and I think you are, too.

35:09.567 --> 35:12.487
So I will see you at work,
partner.

35:21.037 --> 35:24.749
To Archie Andrews,
who saved the cheerleader
and saved the town.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.667
You know what, actually
I think it was Betty's speech.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.629
Here, here to Betty Cooper.

35:29.837 --> 35:31.923
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.050
<i>We had many
milkshakes that night,</i>

35:34.258 --> 35:38.012
<i>and we all felt that as
dangerous as the world
around us had become,</i>

35:38.221 --> 35:42.642
<i>here, at least in this booth,
we were safe.</i>

35:45.978 --> 35:46.979
Cheryl?

35:53.152 --> 35:55.530
- Cheryl?
- In here, Mother.

36:04.622 --> 36:06.040
What is that smell?

36:06.958 --> 36:07.917
Gasoline.

36:09.168 --> 36:12.380
It's the only way we can
truly start over, be purified.

36:14.757 --> 36:16.634
Oh, God.

36:21.973 --> 36:24.267
Wow,
it looks great in here.

36:24.475 --> 36:27.228
I cleaned it up after
Sheriff Keller thrashed it.

36:27.436 --> 36:28.938
Just in case my dad...

36:30.731 --> 36:33.526
Until he gets out,
I'm not giving up on him, Jug.

36:34.277 --> 36:35.611
Hell no.

36:37.572 --> 36:39.824
That is why I love you, Betty.

36:46.831 --> 36:50.293
I love you, Betty Cooper.

36:55.506 --> 36:57.258
Jughead Jones.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.595
I love you.

37:17.195 --> 37:18.613
What about your mom?

37:19.447 --> 37:23.117
At this hour, after mixing
her reds and whites
at the Jubilee,

37:23.326 --> 37:27.121
she's no doubt
sleeping soundly in
the arms of Prince Valium.

37:27.872 --> 37:30.958
So, come on in,
but keep it quiet, okay?

38:18.714 --> 38:20.424
We've had this day
with each other

38:20.633 --> 38:22.343
from the very beginning,
Archiekins.

38:39.735 --> 38:41.737
Oh, my God.

38:41.946 --> 38:43.072
Is that your mom?

38:43.281 --> 38:44.699
Who else would it be?

38:59.588 --> 39:01.924
Easy, Hot Dog. He's family.

39:04.093 --> 39:04.719
Hey.

39:05.636 --> 39:07.888
Heard your dad could have
named names but didn't.

39:10.391 --> 39:11.726
Serpents take care
of their own.

39:12.852 --> 39:15.521
We wanted you to know,
no matter what happens to him,

39:16.314 --> 39:19.066
however long he's gone,
we've got your back.

39:22.903 --> 39:23.904
This is yours,

39:25.114 --> 39:25.906
if you want it.

39:45.801 --> 39:46.844
Juggy?

40:07.281 --> 40:09.283
Leaving without
saying goodbye?

40:09.492 --> 40:11.452
Didn't know you were
such a scoundrel, Archiekins.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.788
I was trying not to wake you.

40:15.289 --> 40:18.084
My dad texted me
asking me to meet
at Pop's for breakfast,

40:18.501 --> 40:21.128
which is what we do
when he wants to talk to me
about something serious.

40:21.337 --> 40:22.797
- Probably me
staying out all night.

40:26.384 --> 40:28.302
I'll call you later.

40:36.602 --> 40:40.189
Hey, Casanova. I, uh...
I ordered you the usual.

40:40.398 --> 40:42.441
Thanks, Dad. I'm just
gonna go wash my hands.

40:56.831 --> 40:58.207
Who's in charge here?
Show me where the safe is!

40:58.416 --> 40:59.542
There is no safe!

40:59.750 --> 41:01.335
You've got a safe.
Show me where it is!

41:01.544 --> 41:03.587
- Where's the safe, old man?
- There ain't no safe.

41:03.796 --> 41:05.005
Show me
where the safe is!

41:26.861 --> 41:28.070
Give me your wallet!

41:31.907 --> 41:35.202
<i>Imagine this instant,
frozen in time.</i>

41:37.413 --> 41:40.040
<i>People will look back at this
as the exact moment</i>

41:40.249 --> 41:43.669
<i>that last bit of Riverdale's
innocence finally died.</i>

41:44.378 --> 41:45.546
<i>When darkness won.</i>

41:47.423 --> 41:49.341
<i>Marked by an
act of violence,</i>

41:51.469 --> 41:54.305
<i>that was anything but random.</i>
