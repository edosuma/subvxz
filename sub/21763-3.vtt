[Julien] Mort's art!

00:47.464 --> 00:50.341
I killed Mort's art!

00:51.468 --> 00:53.511
-Please open this door.
-[Julien yells]

00:53.595 --> 00:56.097
I told you kind and gentle is for babies.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.141
-Hiya!
-Your Majesty, no!

00:58.224 --> 01:00.226
Mort's art!

01:00.310 --> 01:02.020
Remain calm, King Julien...

01:02.103 --> 01:02.979
I can fix this.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.939
What... say what? Mm.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.150
Yeah, it's just pomegranate juices.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.944
The king's been eating his feelings again.

01:10.945 --> 01:15.116
I know it's hard, but sometimes,
you've got to accept things as they are.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.077
How, Maurice? How?

01:17.160 --> 01:22.082
For as long as I can remember,
I've wanted to be a great artiste.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.627
You didn't even mention it
until we had that art show last week.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.505
My memory is shot, Mark...
Mike... Manfred...

01:28.755 --> 01:30.507
Whoever you are. See? Shot.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.591
Boom.

01:33.468 --> 01:37.430
Oh, if only there were some way
to turn back the hands of the hourglass

01:37.514 --> 01:39.390
so this obsession never started.

01:39.474 --> 01:43.478
Whose brilliant idea was that stupid
art show in the first place, huh?

01:44.813 --> 01:48.441
Having this art show
was definitely my brilliant idea.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.359
All mine!

01:49.442 --> 01:50.819
Well, it does seem good for morale.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.071
Mine! Mine-y mine-mine, mine!

01:53.154 --> 01:55.615
And at the very least,
it could sedate the masses into ignoring

01:55.698 --> 01:58.243
the cold, hard truths
of their sad, boring lives.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.787
[whimpers] It's not working.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.832
And some of it's pretty good, too.

02:03.915 --> 02:07.085
Who knew we had so many
creative types in the kingdom?

02:07.168 --> 02:10.171
-[grunts]
-The body is the medium.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.173
-[both groan]
-[laughing]

02:12.257 --> 02:14.425
So, what do you think?

02:14.509 --> 02:15.510
-Huh?
-[both gasp]

02:15.593 --> 02:19.180
I take back what I said about
all creative types.

02:19.264 --> 02:23.685
I literally want to injure
whoever is responsible for this.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.563
You guys don't like my self-portrait?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.606
Ah. [stammering]

02:29.107 --> 02:31.401
You really captured your...

02:31.526 --> 02:32.819
[exclaiming]

02:32.902 --> 02:33.903
...tentacles.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.864
I know, right?

02:35.947 --> 02:38.867
I was totally on the fence
about whether the tentacles,

02:38.950 --> 02:41.161
and also having a horse body
from the waist down,

02:41.244 --> 02:43.204
would be too much, you know?

02:43.288 --> 02:44.247
No, no!

02:44.372 --> 02:46.332
Not at all. You nailed it.

02:46.416 --> 02:51.713
[laughs] So, you're saying you think
I have a future as an artiste!

02:51.796 --> 02:52.714
[laughs]

02:52.797 --> 02:55.425
Do you? Say yes.
Don't think, just say yes.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.343
-Um...
-Future's a pretty loaded term.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.971
-That really demonstrates skill...
-How about that?

03:02.432 --> 03:03.766
[exclaims]

03:07.687 --> 03:13.401
I demand to know who made me look
so regal and wise,

03:13.484 --> 03:14.903
and ready to party!

03:14.986 --> 03:16.863
-[laughs] I love it!
-Hi!

03:16.946 --> 03:18.990
Mort, you painted this?

03:19.073 --> 03:19.991
Yeah.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.620
Sorry. I wish I had enough time
to make it good.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.832
[Julien]  It was better than good.
It was crazy good.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.709
The composition, the colors...

03:29.792 --> 03:33.296
Mort's painting was a triumph
of the lemur spirit.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.049
A work of divine inspiration.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.010
I hated it immediately.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.804
Eh... Just so we're clear,
everyone's impressed

03:41.888 --> 03:45.350
at how awesome I look
in the painting, right?

03:45.433 --> 03:49.979
You could argue the painting of you
looks better than the real thing.

03:50.063 --> 03:50.897
Hmm.

03:50.980 --> 03:51.814
[slurps]

03:51.898 --> 03:52.774
[chuckles]

03:53.024 --> 03:56.319
Right, but I mean, without me,

03:56.402 --> 04:01.199
it would just be some dumb canvas
with oil and color swatches and stuff.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.659
-[Julien exclaims]
-[screams]

04:02.742 --> 04:04.369
Pretty bush league, really.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.038
Pretty bush. Know what I'm sayin'?

04:07.121 --> 04:08.122
Who's with me?

04:08.206 --> 04:11.626
In a sense, I mean,
we are definitely with you.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.711
Mort! This is the most exciting thing

04:13.795 --> 04:17.006
to hit the kingdom's
art world in, well, ever.

04:17.090 --> 04:17.924
Art world?

04:18.007 --> 04:21.135
Well, it's pretty much just me and Dorothy
at the moment.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.137
Oh, but we're very passionate.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.556
Hey, Mort, how much you want
for this thing?

04:25.640 --> 04:26.516
Uh...

04:26.599 --> 04:27.976
Mort, Xixi here.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.062
How does it feel to be
the town's hottest new artist?

04:31.145 --> 04:31.980
Hungry.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.107
You heard it here first, folks.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.111
This is one artist who is hungry
to make a name for himself.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.280
[Julien]  What was happening?

04:40.363 --> 04:43.241
How could I, the king, be upstaged

04:43.324 --> 04:45.285
by this vulgar little mutant?

04:45.368 --> 04:46.828
Seriously, though. When's lunch?

04:46.911 --> 04:48.454
I haven't eaten in, like, a month.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.749
I don't understand.
I poured my heart and soul,

04:51.833 --> 04:53.459
and other body parts into this.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.753
It was supposed to be my masterpiece.

04:56.504 --> 05:00.341
Hey, just because Mort's painting
was good doesn't mean yours was bad.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.345
Maurice is right, Your Majesty.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.597
You should be happy that
Mort's finally being recognized

05:06.681 --> 05:07.724
for something he's good at.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.559
-[retching]
-[exclaiming]

05:09.642 --> 05:12.103
And besides, this'll blow over
soon enough.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.521
[grunts]

05:13.896 --> 05:15.189
I don't know if you noticed,

05:15.273 --> 05:17.984
but the citizens here
aren't exactly art snobs.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.736
[coughing, hacking]

05:19.819 --> 05:22.989
Hey, Abner, come take a look at this thing
I just coughed up.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.907
-She's a beaut.
-[Maurice retching]

05:25.992 --> 05:29.871
[Julien]  But in the days that followed,
Mort's fame only grew,

05:29.954 --> 05:31.831
blossoming like...

05:31.914 --> 05:34.751
I don't know, something like,
something that blossoms?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.003
You know, hives? Do they blo...
I don't know.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.464
I'm real itchy right now. So...

05:39.547 --> 05:41.299
[Julien]  Mort's fame only grew.

05:41.382 --> 05:44.927
You know, I've always been good
at smearing stuff.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.429
[all laugh]

05:47.221 --> 05:49.515
Wait, what did he say? [laughs]

05:49.599 --> 05:52.310
Somebody please tell me
why we're laughing.

05:52.518 --> 05:56.481
[Julien]  Soon, Mort was having parties
with actual guests,

05:56.564 --> 06:00.151
not just his collection of old mannequins
made from rotten mango cores.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.153
Has the overnight fame changed you?

06:03.863 --> 06:04.822
Uh-Uh.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.574
If we wore pants,

06:06.657 --> 06:09.744
I'd still put 'em over my head
one arm at time,

06:09.827 --> 06:11.662
just like everybody else.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.623
-Isn't he a hoot, folks!
-[applause]

06:13.706 --> 06:15.708
[Julien]  And the more popular Mort became,

06:15.792 --> 06:19.378
the more impossible it became
to do my own work.

06:22.423 --> 06:25.676
Shirts and skins!
We can't print these fast enough.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.720
Everybody's cuckoo for 'em.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.264
Mort, we need you to sign these
so they're official.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.808
[giggles]

06:31.891 --> 06:35.144
Ooh! The ink is chilly.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.312
[laughs]

06:36.395 --> 06:38.314
[Julien]  As Mort's stardom rose,

06:38.439 --> 06:42.485
I soon realized if I hoped
to be a great artiste...

06:43.361 --> 06:45.655
I would need his blessing.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.825
Explain again why you're trying
to impress Mort?

06:49.033 --> 06:51.744
As Leonardo da Vinci once said,

06:51.828 --> 06:54.997
"Art is all about who you know, Clover."

06:55.081 --> 06:58.459
I invite Mort over, wine and dine him,
and then...

06:58.876 --> 07:02.004
Oo-yaka! Show him my masterpiece.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.174
"Oh, King Julien! I love it! I love it!

07:05.258 --> 07:08.511
Please be my art partner.
I will tell the art world

07:08.594 --> 07:09.804
how great you are!"

07:09.887 --> 07:11.431
Yadda, yadda, yadda. Boom!

07:11.514 --> 07:15.059
I'm the new hotness of the art world.
[laughs]

07:15.143 --> 07:16.853
Where's the new painting?

07:16.936 --> 07:18.062
Right this way.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.734
I should warn you,
it's the kind of daring artistic statement

07:23.818 --> 07:26.279
that could change you, like, profoundly.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.531
-[both scream]
-I know, Mo-mo.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.326
Your Majesty,

07:32.410 --> 07:37.457
you are really great at loads of things.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.001
Oh? Interesting. Like what?

07:40.084 --> 07:41.377
Like... Maurice?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.212
[laughs]

07:43.296 --> 07:46.048
I should really check
on the kumquat fritters.

07:46.924 --> 07:47.800
[giggles]

07:47.884 --> 07:51.345
My King Julien has invited me to dinner.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.015
My dreams are all coming true.

07:54.098 --> 07:58.561
No, no. You have to stay cool in there
if you really want the king's approval.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.146
Make him work for it.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.648
But, the feet!

08:02.732 --> 08:06.027
It's just simple science,
everyone wants what they can't have.

08:06.110 --> 08:10.281
I want to be a lady dolphin,
saved from the tuna net of my own ego

08:10.364 --> 08:13.409
by a handsome marine biologist
with kind eyes.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.452
[laughs and snorts]

08:14.535 --> 08:18.372
If you think I should hide my true
feelings from King Julien,

08:18.456 --> 08:19.373
I will.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.666
Mm-hm.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.376
[grunts]

08:22.710 --> 08:25.338
Mortimer! My main man!

08:25.421 --> 08:26.964
[laughs]

08:27.590 --> 08:28.549
[exclaims]

08:28.633 --> 08:32.011
[Mort]  Okay, Mort. Be cool, man. Be cool.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.680
But his fur looks so soft.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.599
Is he using a new conditioner?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.559
Ow! I said be cool!

08:38.851 --> 08:41.521
I'm sorry! I just like him so much!

08:41.604 --> 08:43.898
This ain't no time
to be catchin' feelings.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.318
[mumbling]

08:48.361 --> 08:49.779
Eh, Mort?

08:49.862 --> 08:50.738
[giggles]

08:50.821 --> 08:53.282
-Cool.
-'Sup. Brought my crew.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.826
Let me take your coats. [giggles]

08:55.910 --> 08:57.912
Mo-Mo, appeteasers, now!

08:58.037 --> 09:00.039
Three-day weekend!

09:00.122 --> 09:01.666
-What-what?
-[Clover sighs]

09:01.749 --> 09:03.960
Offer Mort your seat, Clover.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.003
It's the gentlemanly thing to do.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.338
I'm not sitting, Your Majesty.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.550
Stop making excuses.
We have special guests.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.426
I am so sorry.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.887
They're usually more
on the ball than this.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.639
Oh, that's okay--

09:16.722 --> 09:20.059
[coughing] We talked about this.

09:20.142 --> 09:23.396
I mean... Yeesh!
But what can you do? You know?

09:23.479 --> 09:26.107
The way things are. Pretty disappointing.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.526
We really whipped up something special.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.570
Great golly, it's working.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.905
Xixi, what are you doing
hanging out with Mort?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.574
Aren't you supposed to be
a journalist or something?

09:34.657 --> 09:37.910
Journalist-schmournalist,
I'm a TV personality.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.413
And that reminds me, Sage,

09:40.496 --> 09:42.915
do I have a green light
to take a run at that or no?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.625
You don't have to answer now.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.919
So, I figured maybe we'd get our eat on,

09:47.003 --> 09:51.924
and then go in the other room
so I can unveil my latest painting.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.009
Uh, the usual.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.011
[giggles] I cannot wait!

09:55.094 --> 09:58.347
Oh, dusty moccasins! What time is it?

09:58.431 --> 09:59.974
Hate to eat and run, King,

10:00.057 --> 10:02.810
but we've got that big exclusive
gallery opening tonight.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.563
But King Julien can come, right?

10:05.646 --> 10:06.480
[growls]

10:07.148 --> 10:10.318
[Mort]  I warned you, man!
I hate when you make me do this!

10:10.401 --> 10:14.196
I mean, sorry, but I only got a plus-four.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.324
So, Sage, how tall are you?

10:16.407 --> 10:18.701
-[Xixi giggling]
-[sobbing]

10:18.784 --> 10:21.287
What was that? You two blew it.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.498
Us? Mort's art friends
were the ones being jerks.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.627
Uh, 'cause they're creative, Maurice.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.879
And creative types are all jerks.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.132
And those jerks didn't even get
to see my new painting.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.217
They'll have other opportunities
to see it.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.720
Oh, yes they will, Clover, they will.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.015
They will see it tonight at the gallery.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.726
We'll secretly place it among Mort's art.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.854
The critics and art lovers will be awed
by this daring new direction.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.608
And just as the excitement
can't grow any bigger,

10:50.691 --> 10:54.028
I expose myself as the true artiste!

10:54.111 --> 10:55.279
[laughs]

10:55.363 --> 10:57.323
"Expose yourself"?

10:57.406 --> 10:59.867
For while King Julien
may not have a ticket

10:59.950 --> 11:01.827
to the big gallery opening...

11:01.911 --> 11:04.121
uh, Chair Lemur-Table does.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.122
How's it goin'?

11:05.206 --> 11:08.584
Chair Lemur-Table does not have a ticket
to the big gallery opening either.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.837
Oh, uh, I didn't realize.
Guess we're breaking in then.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.005
-Oy!
-[groans]

11:13.297 --> 11:14.340
[classical music playing]

11:20.554 --> 11:24.308
[laughs] What do you think?
Pretty sweet, huh?

11:24.392 --> 11:28.813
Oh, yeah, it's like the artist has
deconstructed the very notion of fruit,

11:28.896 --> 11:31.232
forcing us to examine it as a symbol,

11:31.357 --> 11:33.734
rather than a tangible source
of nourishment.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.195
I was gonna say it looked nice and...

11:36.278 --> 11:38.280
[slurping]

11:38.364 --> 11:39.407
ripe.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.951
-[blows raspberry]
-Where did you learn about art?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.577
Well, I used to be a...

11:43.661 --> 11:46.872
Let's just say "freelance art collector."

11:47.540 --> 11:50.876
I love it, but I don't understand it.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.711
Which makes me love it even more!

11:52.795 --> 11:53.879
What does it mean, Mort?

11:53.963 --> 11:58.717
Mm. I just thought it would be fun to eat
fruit off a pedestal instead of a table.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.430
Mind blown!

12:02.513 --> 12:03.764
[imitates explosion]

12:05.641 --> 12:07.184
You all know the plan, right?

12:07.268 --> 12:09.270
Maurice and I create a diversion
and then we--

12:09.353 --> 12:10.312
[coughs]

12:11.272 --> 12:12.106
[sighs]

12:12.189 --> 12:16.402
[Southern accent] We create a diversion
while you sneak around the back...

12:16.485 --> 12:18.195
and plant the painting.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.238
Bingo!

12:19.321 --> 12:23.242
And if you get caught,
deny any knowledge of Chair Lemur-Table.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.203
[mumbling]

12:28.497 --> 12:29.331
Hi.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.708
[retching]

12:31.542 --> 12:33.043
Somebody's gonna spot him.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.007
Attention, the fellow art lovers!

12:38.090 --> 12:39.175
Yoo-hoo!

12:39.258 --> 12:40.718
Over here. This is great.

12:41.677 --> 12:45.014
I have an announcement to make.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.349
-Who are you?
-Me?

12:47.516 --> 12:50.895
Oh, I am a big fancy art critic,

12:50.978 --> 12:53.355
yeah, here to look at the lovely work

12:53.439 --> 12:55.774
that is at this end of the room.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.737
Yeah. Over here is where
all the good stuff is, you see.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.448
Fancy art critics, huh?
What are your names?

13:02.531 --> 13:06.035
Me? I'm... Mango...

13:06.660 --> 13:09.038
Painting... Loser. Yeah!

13:09.121 --> 13:11.540
Mango Painting-Loser. That's my real name.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.043
And I'm Chaz Bondurant, you see.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.545
International Master of Seduction,
now you see.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.215
-Really?
-Oh, like yours was so much better.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.092
Oh, my stars!

13:22.176 --> 13:24.929
What is that masterpiece
on the wall over there?

13:25.012 --> 13:26.972
I didn't notice it before.

13:27.389 --> 13:31.560
As greatest critic of all time,
I, Chair Lemur-Table,

13:31.644 --> 13:35.481
declare this to be the work
of a true visionary.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.483
[all gasping]

13:38.317 --> 13:39.151
Ew trey!

13:40.986 --> 13:42.655
It's horrible!

13:42.738 --> 13:44.865
I so wish I was blind!

13:44.949 --> 13:46.784
Well, hold on.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.705
We should hear what Mort thinks about it.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.543
His opinion is the most important thing.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.670
Pretty cool--

13:59.046 --> 14:00.506
This is a lot of force.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.845
I think I ate too much art.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.806
[all] Ooh.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.808
-That's amazing.
-This is a game changer.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.643
-Daring work.
-Look it!

14:12.726 --> 14:15.521
I get it. But does it get me?

14:15.604 --> 14:19.692
Oh, my stars! That painting was just
awful and uninspired before,

14:19.775 --> 14:22.486
but Mort made it magical!

14:22.695 --> 14:24.697
Oh, I've got the tingles!

14:24.780 --> 14:28.200
Been saying it all along,
don't ya know. Mort is a genius.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.204
Surprise! It is me!

14:32.288 --> 14:35.583
The co-creator of this piece!

14:36.417 --> 14:37.543
King Julien!

14:37.626 --> 14:42.298
[Julien]  With a single geyser
of stomach acid and chunks of fruit,

14:42.381 --> 14:45.175
Mort had once again upstaged me.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.220
Okay, I see that crazy look in your eyes.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.889
Crazy? [laughs]

14:49.972 --> 14:53.142
Relax. Chill, dude. I'm fine.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.895
I mean, it's me we're talking about here.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.229
Let's not do anything like...

14:57.313 --> 15:01.400
By the power invested in me
by the sky gods

15:01.483 --> 15:03.527
and also my uncle
when he tried to kill me,

15:03.611 --> 15:08.866
I royally decree all art is now illegal!

15:08.949 --> 15:09.825
Like that.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.036
[all exclaiming]

15:12.119 --> 15:15.956
Everyone must turn in any art to me
for safekeeping.

15:16.040 --> 15:21.378
I promise this is for your own good
and not 'cause I'm jealous of Mort.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.884
[Julien]  So, we had a fun
little reverse art show.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.929
Instead of selling art,
we were taking it back

15:30.012 --> 15:32.139
without fairly compensating the owners.

15:32.806 --> 15:33.724
Old school.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.976
There's got to be
another way, Your Majesty.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.145
Art hurts people's feelings.

15:38.228 --> 15:42.524
I don't want any of my peoples
to ever be hurt by this art again.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.152
So I'm putting it somewhere safe.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.070
Shame.

15:46.153 --> 15:49.740
This was the first time I was ever able
to look at King Julien as a normal lemur

15:49.823 --> 15:52.326
and not a tyrant I wanted to assassinate.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.996
Your honesty
is a breath of fresh air, Becca.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.666
-Next!
-There you go. Mind the gap.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.794
King Julien, look at them.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.754
This is hurting everybody even worse.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.339
Mort's devastated.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.549
[Mort crying]

16:07.633 --> 16:12.137
I just wanted everyone to see King Julien
the way I see him.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.807
[wailing]

16:16.266 --> 16:19.353
Ted, Dorothy, tell me you have good news.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.938
Oh, boy, do we!

16:21.021 --> 16:23.273
Nearly all Mort's pieces
are accounted for.

16:23.357 --> 16:27.945
And even better, the art we haven't
located has gone way up in value!

16:29.446 --> 16:31.240
Not that we've been reaping the benefits

16:31.323 --> 16:34.410
of a bustling illegal
underground art trade.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.832
You're telling me that by banning art,

16:39.915 --> 16:42.793
I've made it even more popular
and valuable?

16:42.876 --> 16:44.878
Everybody wants what they can't have.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.464
Then I know what I must do.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.467
Clover! Round up any
remaining pieces of art.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.053
Kick down every door in the kingdom
if you have to.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.972
Your Majesty, this has gone far enough.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.599
Do it, Clover! I'm not asking.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.143
On it.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.687
You know who would make
a decree like that?

17:01.812 --> 17:04.023
Your uncle. [grumbling]

17:04.106 --> 17:06.483
Well, that's actually
a compliment, Maurice,

17:06.567 --> 17:10.529
because Uncle King Julien
has aged really well.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.614
Still has most of his hair and teeth.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.867
So, thanks for the kindly words!

17:14.950 --> 17:15.951
Buddy!

17:16.035 --> 17:20.164
[Julien]  By outlawing art,
I had saved all of my peoples

17:20.247 --> 17:22.666
from the heartache that art causes.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.877
At least that's what I told myself.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.004
[inhales, then exhales deeply]

17:29.757 --> 17:30.716
[screams]

17:32.092 --> 17:32.968
[screams]

17:33.635 --> 17:34.511
[screams]

17:34.636 --> 17:36.597
Now Mort was taunting me...

17:37.264 --> 17:39.266
[screams] Times infinity!

17:39.349 --> 17:42.144
And his act of civilized disobedience

17:42.227 --> 17:46.440
was another reminder of how
"just-okay" I was at art.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.027
I did something I wasn't proud of.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.781
Well, this is what happens
when you art all over town.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.201
You basically arted in everyone's faces.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.078
King Julien, it wasn't me.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.705
I would never do anything to hurt you!

18:01.789 --> 18:02.998
[kisses]

18:03.082 --> 18:05.459
-[grunts]
-When it comes to arting,

18:05.542 --> 18:08.754
it's the one who denies it
who supplies it.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.506
You're on lock-down.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.674
Clover, make sure he stays inside.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.220
Imprisoning my own lackey?

18:17.262 --> 18:19.473
It wasn't me doing those things.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.476
It was art.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.730
Why did the sky gods
give Mort all the talent?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.690
But in the days that followed,

18:28.774 --> 18:31.485
I was haunted by dark dreams.

18:31.568 --> 18:37.950
[Maurice]  Your uncle...
Your uncle... Your uncle...

18:38.367 --> 18:39.535
[screams]

18:40.786 --> 18:41.662
[exclaims]

18:44.081 --> 18:44.998
[screams]

18:45.165 --> 18:46.250
Ooh, booty!

18:46.834 --> 18:47.918
[screams]

18:50.087 --> 18:51.004
[Mort growling]

18:55.008 --> 18:56.635
[Julien screams]

18:57.010 --> 18:58.470
[gasps]

18:58.554 --> 19:00.556
[panting]

19:00.639 --> 19:02.474
[screams]

19:04.768 --> 19:05.644
Whew!

19:07.020 --> 19:09.690
[Julien]  I took a stroll
to clear my brainy-parts.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.526
Perhaps I was too hard on Mort.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.112
Maybe I should have given him a second...
What?

19:15.779 --> 19:16.989
[Julien screams]

19:17.072 --> 19:18.407
It's the poster!

19:18.490 --> 19:19.867
[exclaims and screams]

19:19.950 --> 19:21.660
It's a poster! It's another poster!

19:21.743 --> 19:22.870
No! [screams]

19:27.958 --> 19:28.959
[laughs maniacally]

19:30.294 --> 19:32.171
Look at it! It's another one!

19:32.254 --> 19:34.298
[Julien]  The posters taunted me,

19:34.381 --> 19:38.010
like they were trying to get me
to confess something awful.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.386
Then, I did.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.514
I killed Mort's art!

19:42.681 --> 19:43.849
[sobbing]

19:48.145 --> 19:50.856
I don't understand where all those
new posters came from

19:50.939 --> 19:52.608
if Clover was watching Mort.

19:53.275 --> 19:57.154
Well, perhaps someone else was putting up
the posters as an act of rebellion.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.158
Often the more you try to silence
free expression, the more it pops up.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.577
I wanted to be a great artiste.

20:03.660 --> 20:07.080
This is the first time I've ever
wanted something I didn't get.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.417
Good. Not getting what you want
builds character.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.880
Yeah? Why does character-building
have to be so unpleasant?

20:14.963 --> 20:16.882
It's okay, Your Majesty.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.008
Mm. Mm.

20:18.967 --> 20:19.843
[groans]

20:21.386 --> 20:24.223
Eh? Is someone stuck to me?

20:24.306 --> 20:27.809
Must be the pomegranate juice
that's making your fur sticky.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.020
-[laughs]
-I didn't get it on my back.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.271
-[grunts]
-Ow!

20:34.816 --> 20:35.651
[grunts]

20:35.734 --> 20:36.735
[shivers]

20:38.111 --> 20:39.112
Wait a minute!

20:41.531 --> 20:43.242
Mm-hmm. Paste.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.994
And your face is smudged with ink.

20:46.078 --> 20:46.954
No, it's not.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.205
[grunts]

20:48.288 --> 20:50.415
Why is your paw sticky, Clover?
Huh? Why? Why?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.834
You gonna tell me? Why? Why? Why?

20:52.918 --> 20:54.294
Is it paste? Is it? Why? Clover?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.588
Why? Tell me. Why? Why? Why? Why?

20:56.713 --> 20:58.548
Yes! It was me, okay?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.342
-[Julien gasps]
-I hung the posters.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.552
But what you were doing
to Mort wasn't right!

21:02.636 --> 21:03.679
[straining]

21:03.762 --> 21:06.098
You broke a rule? Why?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.058
[straining] I respect the law...

21:09.768 --> 21:12.437
but I also think if the law is unjust,

21:12.521 --> 21:15.691
[grunts] everyone has a responsibility
to fight against it. Get off!

21:17.401 --> 21:20.237
I passed an unjust law, didn't I?

21:20.362 --> 21:21.488
I became a monster.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.782
Worse, I became Uncle King Julien.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.450
Mort doesn't deserve that.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.829
Art is the only thing that gives
that little trainwreck's life meaning.

21:28.912 --> 21:29.955
What do I do?

21:30.831 --> 21:33.125
Just tell him you're sorry.
He'll forgive you.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.584
[whimpering]

21:35.627 --> 21:37.421
[shushes] Go to him.

21:38.714 --> 21:39.589
Go!

21:39.715 --> 21:41.466
[Mort exclaiming]

21:43.176 --> 21:44.886
Feet! [giggles]

21:46.513 --> 21:48.140
King Julien!

21:49.349 --> 21:50.225
[clears throat]

21:50.309 --> 21:52.102
Mort. I've been a jerk.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.730
And not one of those cool, creative jerks.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.274
-I got jealous that you were good at art.
-[exclaiming]

21:57.524 --> 22:00.485
I'm sorry. I'm making art legal again.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.739
Really? Oh, that makes me so happy!

22:03.864 --> 22:07.284
Yeah, any time you feel the urge to art,
you know what?

22:07.367 --> 22:08.493
Let 'er rip, buddy.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.873
All right, okay, bring it in.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.750
Oh! [exclaiming]

22:16.376 --> 22:18.295
I waited for you, the feet.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.254
[kisses]

22:19.338 --> 22:22.758
-Okay, yeah, soak it all in, buddy.
-Oh, yeah! [exclaiming]

22:23.467 --> 22:24.885
Yeah, get a good one in there.

22:25.635 --> 22:26.970
[laughs]

22:27.345 --> 22:28.680
[exclaiming]

22:29.389 --> 22:31.725
Oh, Maurice, come on, man!

22:31.808 --> 22:34.978
Your feet smell like a dirty diaper
filled with cabbage!

22:35.062 --> 22:36.563
[groans] It's bad.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.192
-[exclaims]
-[groans]

22:41.359 --> 22:42.861
[classical music playing]
