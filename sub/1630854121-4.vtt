00:01.202 --> 00:04.576
-Previously on The Resident...
-You're making out a will?

00:04.676 --> 00:05.545
I realized I don't have one.

00:05.612 --> 00:06.580
You are not going to die.

00:06.647 --> 00:07.849
You can't promise me that.

00:07.916 --> 00:10.053
Chastain is performing mandatory
drug testing

00:10.120 --> 00:11.657
on all doctors today.

00:13.961 --> 00:15.230
Positive.

00:15.297 --> 00:17.101
This hospital-wide drug test.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.336
Did you name my father?

00:18.403 --> 00:20.140
And I didn't break
that confidence.

00:20.207 --> 00:21.877
I don't need you to save me.

00:21.944 --> 00:24.081
Baby number one is out.

00:25.017 --> 00:26.620
<i>Baby number two.</i>

00:26.720 --> 00:29.392
The babies are in the NICU
if you want to go see them.

00:30.862 --> 00:32.966
I've been taking
Oxaprozin for my back.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.168
It causes a false positive.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.538
Kit's asked me
to stop taking them.

00:35.605 --> 00:36.807
I'll test again in a week.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.476
Just wanted you to know.

00:41.617 --> 00:43.320
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>So, how about some weather?</i>

00:43.386 --> 00:44.355
<i>Joanne, you there</i>
<i>with our weather today?</i>

00:44.422 --> 00:45.792
I don't hear water running.

00:45.892 --> 00:47.094
(groans)

00:47.161 --> 00:50.367
Those teeth aren't gonna
clean themselves.

00:50.434 --> 00:53.674
Giorgiana Grace. Chop-chop.
We're gonna be late.

00:53.741 --> 00:55.778
(Gigi coughs)

00:56.847 --> 00:58.951
Gigi?

00:59.018 --> 01:00.755
(Gigi coughs)

01:04.295 --> 01:05.698
Hey.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.938
What's all that hacking up here?

01:09.005 --> 01:11.543
I feel sick.

01:12.311 --> 01:14.917
You're not warm.
Tell me what hurts.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.954
I think I have a cold.

01:17.054 --> 01:19.425
(coughs)

01:20.460 --> 01:22.398
Oh, no.

01:22.498 --> 01:24.402
That sounds
much worse than a cold.

01:24.468 --> 01:28.678
It sounds like you have
Ferris Bueller Syndrome.

01:28.744 --> 01:29.880
What's that?

01:29.947 --> 01:33.386
It is a very rare disease
where little boys and girls

01:33.486 --> 01:37.963
fake sick so they don't have
to go to school.

01:38.029 --> 01:42.071
Sounds pretty serious to me.

01:43.039 --> 01:45.177
This isn't about school, is it?

01:45.243 --> 01:47.314
Sounds like someone's
worried about

01:47.381 --> 01:49.586
their belt ceremony tonight.

01:49.686 --> 01:52.759
I don't want to do
tae kwon do anymore.

01:52.826 --> 01:54.796
But you love tae kwon do.
And you've worked so hard.

01:54.863 --> 01:57.434
Don't you want to get that cool
yellow stripe on your belt?

01:57.535 --> 02:00.742
You only move up
if you break the board.

02:00.808 --> 02:03.313
I've seen you do
that routine a hundred times.

02:03.380 --> 02:04.716
What's the problem?

02:04.816 --> 02:07.922
And I will be there
cheering you on the whole time.

02:08.023 --> 02:09.559
Okay?

02:09.626 --> 02:11.764
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I can't do it.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.803

♪ ♪

03:18.029 --> 03:19.231
Morning, Tabitha.

03:19.331 --> 03:21.102
Ooh, love the hair.
New highlights?

03:21.169 --> 03:22.605
-They are.
-Mm.

03:22.672 --> 03:24.475
Funny, my husband
didn't even notice.

03:24.543 --> 03:26.814
Sounds like your husband needs
to get his eyes checked.

03:26.914 --> 03:28.818
(both chuckling)

03:28.884 --> 03:31.456
Did something happen
to your eyes? They're...

03:31.557 --> 03:32.726
black.

03:33.393 --> 03:35.397
Oh. (chuckles)
Nothing.

03:35.464 --> 03:36.934
-Annual eye checkup.
-Mm.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.773
That's what a few drops
of tropicamide will do for you.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.808
Hmm.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.814
My cousin, his eyes used
to be dilated like that.

03:43.914 --> 03:46.620
Turns out, he was
in withdrawal at the time.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.691
You're not withdrawing
from drugs now,

03:48.758 --> 03:49.860
are you, Dr. Sullivan?

03:49.926 --> 03:51.229
(laughs)
That's hilarious.

03:51.295 --> 03:52.431
-You're hilarious.
-(chuckles)

03:52.532 --> 03:54.569
On that note, though,
I-I do have

03:54.636 --> 03:57.007
an important operation
that-that demands my attention

03:57.074 --> 03:58.042
this afternoon. I'm--

03:58.109 --> 03:59.245
I'm wondering if we can move

03:59.345 --> 04:00.748
that drug test up
to earlier in the day.

04:00.848 --> 04:02.384
Ideally before noon?

04:02.451 --> 04:04.021
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Sullivan,

04:04.088 --> 04:06.192
but we outsource those tests
to a third party company.

04:06.259 --> 04:09.265
They won't be here
until your appointment at 4:00.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.404
That's a shame.

04:12.471 --> 04:14.776
But... I will make sure

04:14.843 --> 04:16.547
they're still here
after your surgery.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.551
We will get you tested, Ian,
don't you worry.

04:18.651 --> 04:21.055
-Thank you, Tabitha.
-Mm-hmm.

04:21.757 --> 04:24.495
21-year-old woman
with endocarditis

04:24.563 --> 04:26.332
in the setting of IV opiates.

04:26.365 --> 04:28.036
She's on broad spectrum
antibiotics

04:28.103 --> 04:29.606
with stable hemodynamics.

04:29.673 --> 04:30.675
Diana, hi.

04:30.741 --> 04:33.981
I'm Dr. Sullivan.
How are you feeling?

04:34.950 --> 04:35.852
My baby.

04:35.918 --> 04:38.423
Have you, have you seen,
have you seen her?

04:38.524 --> 04:41.897
Diana gave birth to a baby girl
late last night.

04:41.964 --> 04:43.734
What's your daughter's name?

04:43.767 --> 04:46.540
They won't let me see her.
Is-is she okay?

04:46.607 --> 04:48.677
Looks like there's
a Baby Jane Doe

04:48.711 --> 04:51.182
in the neonatal
intensive care unit.

04:51.282 --> 04:52.819
I can pop by and check on her.

04:54.656 --> 04:57.294
It's my fault
that she's suffering.

04:58.062 --> 05:01.670
Everybody told me that I would
screw her up if I didn't stop.

05:01.770 --> 05:03.607
But I didn't.

05:03.707 --> 05:05.377
We'll get you a list
of treatment centers

05:05.443 --> 05:08.016
once you're
a little more stable.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.957
My baby needs her mama.

05:14.161 --> 05:15.698
I want to get clean.

05:15.832 --> 05:17.902
I believe you.

05:17.969 --> 05:21.777
But first we need to get
this infection under control.

05:21.844 --> 05:24.716
We'll be back
to check on you soon.

05:32.097 --> 05:33.667
(sighs)

05:33.767 --> 05:36.507
Uh, let's do another
blood culture on Diana.

05:36.573 --> 05:39.746
And run a CBC, ESR, and CRP.

05:40.581 --> 05:44.388
She's just so nice. And sad.

05:44.455 --> 05:47.361
-I feel bad for her.
-(sighs) So do I.

05:47.427 --> 05:49.431
But right now there are
still drugs in her system.

05:49.498 --> 05:53.507
And once she starts withdrawal,
Diana will not be as nice.

05:53.607 --> 05:55.343
You should prepare
yourself for that.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.049
My uncle was the same way.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.418
He was a completely
different person

05:59.519 --> 06:02.424
when he was trying
to stop drinking.

06:02.559 --> 06:05.163
Addiction is a horrible disease.

06:05.263 --> 06:09.639
Sometimes fighting it can look
just as ugly as feeding it.

06:12.679 --> 06:14.516
Is this about
her nightmares again?

06:14.583 --> 06:17.020
<i>CONRAD:</i>
<i>Luckily, the nightmares</i>
<i>seem to be a thing</i>

06:17.120 --> 06:18.423
of the past.

06:18.489 --> 06:21.162
Gigi and I have
a new challenge now.

06:21.262 --> 06:22.732
She needs some tough love.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.172
-So, can you cover for me?
-Don't worry, man, I got you.

06:26.239 --> 06:27.642
<i>You sure you don't mind?</i>

06:27.709 --> 06:29.546
Well, it's either this
or I'm washing cloth diapers

06:29.613 --> 06:31.415
to prep for
the twins' homecoming.

06:31.482 --> 06:33.052
You're doing me a favor.

06:33.119 --> 06:34.856
(chuckles)
All right.

06:34.956 --> 06:36.325
Thanks, man. I owe you.

06:36.425 --> 06:38.396
<i>And tell Gigi I hope</i>
<i>she feels better.</i>

06:38.463 --> 06:40.467
-Will do.
-Sorry, Daddy.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.473
Did I get you
in trouble at work?

06:44.441 --> 06:46.412
No, you didn't.

06:46.546 --> 06:48.584
Uncle Devon's gonna
cover for me.

06:48.651 --> 06:49.819
But don't think this means

06:49.920 --> 06:51.222
you're getting out
of your belt ceremony.

06:51.289 --> 06:53.594
-But, Daddy...
-No buts.

06:53.661 --> 06:55.130
Listen, we are gonna practice

06:55.196 --> 06:58.202
until you can do every single
takedown in your sleep.

06:58.336 --> 06:59.471
Capisce?

06:59.539 --> 07:00.775
-Capisce.
-All right.

07:00.841 --> 07:02.679
But you don't know tae kwon do.

07:02.745 --> 07:04.516
Well, then you better teach me.

07:04.582 --> 07:07.421
All right? Now let's go.

07:10.493 --> 07:11.730
What do you got for me, Feldman?

07:11.863 --> 07:13.199
34-year-old female
with myasthenia gravis.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.136
Her parents brought her
to the ED after finding her

07:15.203 --> 07:16.607
at the bottom
of their staircase.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.644
Classic muscle weakness.
Clearly an MG flare-up.

07:18.744 --> 07:20.881
But what caused the flare
is your problem, not mine.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.587
This woman was diagnosed
over six years ago.

07:23.654 --> 07:24.789
Myasthenia gravis is chronic,

07:24.889 --> 07:26.225
but she should be
in remission by now.

07:26.325 --> 07:27.528
IRVING:
No, the treatments never worked.

07:27.629 --> 07:28.931
Her neuromuscular symptoms

07:28.998 --> 07:30.901
worsened to the point
that she had to move back in

07:31.002 --> 07:32.939
-with her parents
for full-time caretaking.
-Hmm.

07:33.006 --> 07:35.511
Well, looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.

07:35.578 --> 07:36.513
Yeah, you'll like Marty.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.550
She's a nerd. Like you.

07:38.651 --> 07:39.886
Then we can finally see

07:39.953 --> 07:42.457
if you can still hang
with the real doctors.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.604
<i>WOMAN (over P. A.):</i>
<i>Attending to vocational</i>
<i>counseling...</i>

07:48.671 --> 07:49.906
Hi.

07:49.973 --> 07:53.479
I'm Dr. Pravesh.
You must be Marty.

07:53.547 --> 07:57.354
Who is Marty?
Why is Marty?

07:58.022 --> 08:00.226
I usually reserve
my existential dread

08:00.293 --> 08:01.295
for the end of the day.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.801
-But I think I can
make an exception.
-(laughs)

08:03.901 --> 08:05.805
I heard you took
a little tumble.

08:05.905 --> 08:08.343
I didn't want to ask for help.

08:08.443 --> 08:11.415
When your 70-year-old parents
have to get you to the bathroom

08:11.550 --> 08:14.723
every morning, you keep
the requests to a minimum.

08:14.789 --> 08:16.425
At least when I'm
in the hospital,

08:16.492 --> 08:17.995
they get a break from it all.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.501
Probably a nice break
for you, too.

08:21.135 --> 08:22.772
Well, if I could
help them out financially,

08:22.839 --> 08:24.542
I might feel
a little bit better.

08:24.576 --> 08:26.078
But that's the one
universal truth

08:26.178 --> 08:27.582
they don't tell you about.

08:27.648 --> 08:30.320
You can't get a job
with a philosophy degree.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.558
Oh, it all makes sense.

08:32.658 --> 08:33.761
You're a truth seeker.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.463
(chuckles)

08:35.531 --> 08:37.134
Too bad the truth
doesn't pay, huh?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.873
I'd like to get to the bottom
of your myasthenia flare.

08:39.973 --> 08:41.308
So if you don't mind
hanging out,

08:41.409 --> 08:44.014
I can admit you
and run some tests, okay?

08:44.081 --> 08:47.254
Lucky for both of us,
I got nowhere to be.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.425
(chuckles softly)
I'll be back.

08:49.491 --> 08:51.162
All right.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.268
The twins look perfect.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.405
Healthy weight,
strong heartbeats.

08:56.472 --> 08:59.278
I'd say this family can
go home this afternoon.

08:59.378 --> 09:00.280
Ah, you hear that, Padma?

09:00.380 --> 09:02.819
We're finally breaking
you guys out of here.

09:02.885 --> 09:05.658
That is music to my ears. Oh.

09:05.725 --> 09:07.094
I'll see you and the boys
in a month.

09:07.194 --> 09:08.597
You need anything, you call.

09:08.697 --> 09:11.068
Thank you, Ian.

09:12.037 --> 09:13.640
(baby crying)

09:13.707 --> 09:16.546
Strong lungs on this one.

09:16.613 --> 09:17.949
She have a name?

09:18.082 --> 09:19.351
This is Jane.

09:19.418 --> 09:21.489
Well, that's what
we're calling her.

09:21.590 --> 09:23.326
Typical NAS baby.
She just...

09:23.426 --> 09:24.729
she can't get comfortable.

09:24.796 --> 09:26.098
Well, I'd be miserable, too,

09:26.165 --> 09:28.336
-if I was withdrawing
from drugs.
-Yeah.

09:28.436 --> 09:29.906
-May I?
-Yes.

09:29.973 --> 09:31.676
(baby crying)

09:31.743 --> 09:35.751
I know it hurts, sweetie.
Trust me, I know.

09:35.818 --> 09:36.953
Where's the mother?

09:37.020 --> 09:40.728
Admitted in ICU.
Long-term heroin user.

09:40.761 --> 09:44.969
Although "mother" is not
the word I would choose.

09:45.069 --> 09:46.640
Neural tube defect.

09:46.740 --> 09:49.077
Has anyone taken Jane for scans?

09:49.178 --> 09:50.848
(echoing):
Well, Dr. Lawrence said
he would check her out

09:50.915 --> 09:52.752
after he got out of the OR.

09:52.852 --> 09:54.021
Unless you could
take a look at her

09:54.087 --> 09:55.925
because I've had
a really rough day today,

09:56.025 --> 09:57.995
and I just,
I could really use your help.

09:58.129 --> 10:00.099
(baby screaming)

10:00.166 --> 10:01.368
I'll be back for Jane.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.041
There's something I need
to take care of.

10:10.386 --> 10:12.124
(retching)

10:12.190 --> 10:15.564
Dr. Sullivan, everything
all right in there?

10:15.664 --> 10:17.869
All good, Susan.
Out in a sec.

10:17.935 --> 10:20.206
SUSAN:
Dr. Voss is out
of the office today.

10:20.306 --> 10:21.810
She asked me to remind you
about your follow-up

10:21.910 --> 10:23.012
this afternoon, the drug test.

10:23.112 --> 10:24.314
Yeah, of course.

10:24.381 --> 10:26.218
(quietly):
Drug test.
Who could forget that?

10:26.285 --> 10:29.659
They'll be ready for you
in the lab at 4:00.

10:29.726 --> 10:31.663
4:00. Can't wait.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.305
Oh, my God.

10:36.405 --> 10:39.178
Oh... Nine hours.

10:41.148 --> 10:43.587
Nine hours.

10:43.654 --> 10:45.558
Take your test,

10:45.658 --> 10:49.097
then all the pills you want.

10:54.174 --> 10:55.911
Less than a day old,
and this little girl

10:55.978 --> 10:57.147
has already been through it all.

10:57.214 --> 10:58.750
Outside of her obvious
spinal deformity,

10:58.851 --> 11:00.955
this is what
concerns me the most.

11:01.021 --> 11:03.527
Proximity of her neural tissue
to the skin.

11:03.594 --> 11:05.230
They're practically touching.

11:05.296 --> 11:07.702
Jane needs surgery,
no doubt about that.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.204
Preferably sooner than later.

11:09.271 --> 11:13.212
I can book us an OR for noon,
if that works for you.

11:13.312 --> 11:15.216
I-I'd rather do after 4:00.

11:15.283 --> 11:18.289
That gives us time
to get an MRI under sedation.

11:18.356 --> 11:19.993
Well, the longer we wait,
the more at-risk Jane is

11:20.093 --> 11:21.395
for a catastrophic CNS
infection.

11:21.495 --> 11:23.667
Her immune system is
way too fragile to fight that.

11:23.734 --> 11:25.303
(breathing unsteadily)

11:27.007 --> 11:29.111
Dr. Sullivan, are you
feeling okay?

11:29.177 --> 11:31.983
It's like a sauna in here,
don't you think?

11:32.083 --> 11:32.785
(weak laugh)

11:32.885 --> 11:34.789
You know, you're right.

11:34.889 --> 11:36.292
Let's move forward
with the surgery.

11:36.425 --> 11:39.197
I-I'll check my schedule.
I'll get back to you.

11:44.107 --> 11:45.878
All right,
on the count of three

11:45.978 --> 11:47.915
you can open your eyes.

11:48.015 --> 11:49.719
One...

11:49.819 --> 11:53.392
two...
(exhales sharply)

11:53.492 --> 11:55.496
three.

11:56.398 --> 12:00.741
Grandmaster Hawkins' dojo
is officially open.

12:00.808 --> 12:03.012
In Korea they call it
a <i>dojang.</i>

12:03.079 --> 12:05.618
Yeah, well,
my apologies to Korea.

12:05.718 --> 12:07.855
And you're not a grandmaster.

12:07.922 --> 12:11.495
We'll see about that.
You ready?

12:15.470 --> 12:19.478
<i>-Kamsahamnida.</i>
<i>-Kamsahamnida.</i>

12:24.187 --> 12:26.225
Protect yourself.

12:27.327 --> 12:30.500
<i>-Kiai!</i>
<i>-Kiai!</i>

12:30.567 --> 12:32.037
<i>Kiai...</i>

12:33.105 --> 12:35.276
Now...

12:35.878 --> 12:39.318
(exhales slowly)

12:39.418 --> 12:42.190
Break the board, young Padawan.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.662
-Kiai!
-(groans)

12:44.762 --> 12:46.432
Daddy, are you okay?

12:46.498 --> 12:48.169
(straining):
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:48.269 --> 12:50.139
I'll get my nurse's kit.

12:50.239 --> 12:52.377
(Conrad groans)

13:00.026 --> 13:01.328
(sighs)

13:04.569 --> 13:07.107
Artificial urine?

13:13.820 --> 13:15.724
Okay, that's more like it.

13:15.824 --> 13:17.962
(knock on door)

13:18.095 --> 13:20.400
Hey, you're running point
on Baby Jane Doe

13:20.500 --> 13:23.807
-in the NICU, right?
-I am, yeah. Who-Who's asking?

13:23.940 --> 13:25.143
The mother.
She's in my ICU.

13:25.243 --> 13:26.579
I promised I'd give her
an update.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.686
How about I come down
and talk to her?

13:29.819 --> 13:31.923
Great. Okay.

13:31.990 --> 13:34.094
-See you down there.
-All right.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.416
I don't get it.

13:45.517 --> 13:49.491
My, my baby's spinal cord is
outside of her body?

13:49.592 --> 13:51.028
Not exactly.

13:51.128 --> 13:54.034
Uh, a neural tube defect occurs

13:54.167 --> 13:56.706
when the fetus doesn't get

13:56.806 --> 13:58.610
enough folic acid
during pregnancy.

13:58.677 --> 14:00.413
And when this happens,

14:00.514 --> 14:04.488
the-the lower part of the spine
can't grow properly.

14:04.555 --> 14:06.726
-Folic acid? What is that?
-Mm.

14:06.826 --> 14:08.663
No one told me anything
about any vitamins.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.266
Well, you know what,
they might have

14:10.366 --> 14:12.237
if you'd shown up for a single
prenatal appointment.

14:14.041 --> 14:16.412
What's important is that
Dr. Sullivan is going to

14:16.546 --> 14:18.583
repair the sac of fluid
on your daughter's back.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.153
IAN:
Mm-hmm.

14:20.219 --> 14:22.323
And me and my baby
can go home?

14:22.457 --> 14:25.631
We will talk timelines
once both of you

14:25.697 --> 14:28.102
are back on your feet.

14:37.153 --> 14:38.422
What you should have told her
is that no doctor

14:38.489 --> 14:40.026
in their right mind
would send a child home

14:40.126 --> 14:42.063
with an active heroin addict.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.900
And who would that help?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.203
Diana is suffering, too.

14:45.303 --> 14:46.639
She knows she hurt
her daughter.

14:46.706 --> 14:48.777
Oh, does she? I heard she was
out in the parking lot

14:48.844 --> 14:50.480
shooting up before
she came in to deliver.

14:50.581 --> 14:53.687
And I'm horrified by that, but
both mom and daughter are here

14:53.754 --> 14:56.391
because they had virtually
no access to prenatal care.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.329
She was set up to fail
from the start.

14:58.429 --> 15:01.001
I don't think she is in there
beating herself up

15:01.068 --> 15:02.337
over what happens,
and if you think she is,

15:02.404 --> 15:05.476
you have no idea
how addiction works.

15:06.679 --> 15:08.349
(sighs)

15:09.786 --> 15:11.054
Ever since Bell left
for Minnesota,

15:11.121 --> 15:12.758
I feel like I've been coasting.

15:12.825 --> 15:15.731
No other surgeon has let me cut.

15:15.798 --> 15:17.300
I really need a challenge.

15:17.434 --> 15:19.070
You've got this, babe.

15:19.204 --> 15:23.847
That blood panel has really
got your attention.

15:23.947 --> 15:25.684
Should I be jealous?

15:25.784 --> 15:28.022
I'm sorry.

15:28.122 --> 15:29.892
None of this makes any sense.

15:29.992 --> 15:31.361
Marty's in her mid-30s.

15:31.428 --> 15:32.765
There's no reason her disease
should have progressed

15:32.832 --> 15:34.334
to need full-time caretaking.

15:34.401 --> 15:38.242
A lot of myasthenia patients
respond to plasma transfusions.

15:38.342 --> 15:42.083
Except she's receiving plasma
every six months.

15:42.183 --> 15:44.121
It helps until it doesn't,
as does prednisone,

15:44.221 --> 15:47.427
azathioprine,
mycophenolate, rituximab.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.337
(sighs)

15:52.403 --> 15:56.078
Unless... the reason none
of her treatments have worked

15:56.145 --> 15:59.986
is... is because we're treating
the wrong thing.

16:00.086 --> 16:01.990
And by the way,
if you want to cut again,

16:02.056 --> 16:04.762
try working with Nolan.

16:04.862 --> 16:06.331
Okay.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.937
I have to go.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.114
Marty, I think it's time
we take a step back.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.353
Reassess the basis
of why you're here.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.959
-Now who's the existential one?
-What I mean is,

16:20.026 --> 16:22.965
have you ever considered
that your original diagnosis

16:23.032 --> 16:25.637
could be flawed?

16:25.771 --> 16:30.046
What, like I don't have
myasthenia?

16:30.146 --> 16:31.481
On paper you fit
all of the criteria

16:31.583 --> 16:32.718
for myasthenia gravis.

16:32.751 --> 16:34.922
Wait, if I don't have it,
then what's wrong with me?

16:35.022 --> 16:36.626
I have no idea.

16:38.095 --> 16:39.064
I'm sorry, Marty, I...

16:39.164 --> 16:42.003
I don't mean to overwhelm you.

16:45.677 --> 16:50.419
I've just always been someone
who questions everything.

16:50.521 --> 16:52.323
Whether there's a God

16:52.390 --> 16:56.031
or if time is an illusion or...

16:57.568 --> 17:02.377
But I never once thought
to question my diagnosis.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.253
You want answers, and I want
to give them to you.

17:07.320 --> 17:11.194
This means we have to run
a few more tests.

17:11.261 --> 17:15.002
All right.
Let's do it.

17:19.044 --> 17:20.847
Let's get security on standby.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.250
That is my baby in there.

17:22.350 --> 17:23.587
You cannot take her from me.

17:23.687 --> 17:25.924
I understand this is upsetting,
but we have to do

17:25.991 --> 17:27.460
what's best for Jane.

17:27.528 --> 17:29.397
You think going to a foster home
is better than

17:29.464 --> 17:31.435
her own mother?!

17:32.103 --> 17:33.372
-She needs me.
-We'll make sure

17:33.405 --> 17:35.343
-CPS finds her a safe home.
-No.

17:35.376 --> 17:36.345
This isn't permanent, okay?

17:36.445 --> 17:38.917
You can still make this right.

17:38.984 --> 17:39.986
It hurts.

17:40.052 --> 17:41.789
It all hurts!

17:41.889 --> 17:42.858
I know. I know, Diana,

17:42.958 --> 17:45.396
but you can still get clean.
Okay?

17:45.496 --> 17:48.637
-(monitors beeping rapidly)
-Diana?

17:48.737 --> 17:49.772
What's going on?

17:49.839 --> 17:52.878
She's in shock. Likely sepsis
from the endocarditis.

17:52.978 --> 17:54.214
I need a norepi drip

17:54.281 --> 17:56.586
and an intubation kit
in here now.

18:02.030 --> 18:03.365
Is she gonna be okay?

18:03.432 --> 18:06.104
Diana has a lot
to make up for.

18:06.238 --> 18:08.610
We're not giving up
on her just yet.

18:15.691 --> 18:18.429
Pupils are reactive.
That's a good sign.

18:18.530 --> 18:21.301
BP is still low.
The pressors aren't enough.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.573
Hand me that ultrasound.

18:30.887 --> 18:32.156
What is it?

18:32.223 --> 18:33.793
Diana has a splenomegaly.

18:33.893 --> 18:36.833
Why would her spleen
be enlarged?

18:36.933 --> 18:38.168
It's hard to say for sure,

18:38.235 --> 18:39.705
so we need to get her
to Imaging to confirm.

18:39.772 --> 18:43.345
We can't move her like this.
She-she could crash again.

18:43.412 --> 18:44.915
She will eventually if we don't
get a clearer picture

18:45.016 --> 18:46.251
of what's going on.

18:46.351 --> 18:50.560
Page Dr. Devi and tell her
to meet us in CT.

18:59.411 --> 19:01.582
-(machine chimes)
-Scans are up.

19:06.726 --> 19:09.331
Well, the refractory fever
makes more sense.

19:09.431 --> 19:11.836
I don't think I've ever seen
a spleen with so many abscesses.

19:11.903 --> 19:14.542
The bacteria from her heart
has metastasized into clots,

19:14.642 --> 19:16.345
moving from one organ
to the next.

19:16.478 --> 19:18.683
A splenectomy might be
her only option.

19:18.783 --> 19:22.090
-Will she even survive
a surgery?
-Maybe.

19:22.190 --> 19:23.392
Maybe not.

19:23.459 --> 19:24.662
Looking at these scans,

19:24.729 --> 19:27.100
I doubt she'll survive
without it either.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.903
-She's your patient.
-(Cade sighs)

19:28.970 --> 19:31.709
What do you want to do?

19:32.511 --> 19:36.385
You're right.
Let's do the surgery.

19:39.892 --> 19:41.562
Thank you.

19:41.629 --> 19:42.497
Hey.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.069
Can you spare a second
to pick your brain?

19:45.136 --> 19:47.340
-Shoot.
-My patient, she's 34

19:47.407 --> 19:50.312
and diagnosed with
myasthenia gravis years ago.

19:50.379 --> 19:51.682
That's a rough one.

19:51.783 --> 19:53.318
But at least the prognosis
is decent.

19:53.385 --> 19:55.022
Except hers isn't,
which is why I questioned

19:55.089 --> 19:56.859
if she was misdiagnosed.

19:56.926 --> 19:58.028
Okay, I hear you.

19:58.128 --> 19:59.297
Have you tested her yourself?

19:59.431 --> 20:01.101
Blood test, edrophonium test.

20:01.168 --> 20:02.538
All point back to myasthenia.

20:02.604 --> 20:04.742
None explain why her
muscle weakness

20:04.842 --> 20:06.512
isn't responding to treatment.

20:06.579 --> 20:09.885
Well, maybe the weakness isn't
coming from her muscles at all.

20:09.952 --> 20:13.526
If that's true, an
electromyography could confirm.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.429
An EMG will tell you
if your patient's weakness

20:15.496 --> 20:18.235
is coming from her muscles
or her nerve cells.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.505
If it turns out to be
a muscle issue,

20:19.572 --> 20:21.441
then she most likely has
myasthenia gravis.

20:21.542 --> 20:24.380
But if the EMG proves
the nerve cells are responsible,

20:24.447 --> 20:25.817
there's no way
she has myasthenia.

20:25.884 --> 20:28.957
An EMG is an incredibly
invasive procedure.

20:29.057 --> 20:31.428
Not to mention
excruciatingly painful.

20:31.529 --> 20:33.633
Yes, but if the result is
what I think it is,

20:33.733 --> 20:36.371
we could potentially cure
her symptoms.

20:36.438 --> 20:37.574
You know, Devon, some people

20:37.641 --> 20:39.177
just don't respond to treatment.

20:39.277 --> 20:40.714
We never know why.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.152
Are you sure this is
more than a hunch?

20:43.218 --> 20:44.722
My patient wants answers.

20:44.755 --> 20:48.128
She'll do whatever it takes
to get them, and so will I.

20:48.195 --> 20:49.364
So, can you do it?

20:49.464 --> 20:51.001
I just hope,
for your patient's sake,

20:51.067 --> 20:52.838
this is worth it.

20:56.344 --> 20:58.750
(phone chimes)

20:59.652 --> 21:01.522
Are you waiting
on Postmates, too?

21:01.589 --> 21:05.797
Yep. Should be here
any minute.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.601
Hope it's not one
of those ghost kitchens.

21:07.668 --> 21:10.439
I've had my fair share of
pad thai that never showed up.

21:10.540 --> 21:13.847
Yeah, that-that won't be
a problem.

21:13.947 --> 21:15.884
(phone chimes)

21:17.921 --> 21:20.760
(chiming)

21:21.829 --> 21:23.766
You got to be kidding me.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.939
IRVING:
Yeah, ghost kitchen strikes
again.

21:30.212 --> 21:32.216
All right,
this is gonna hurt,

21:32.350 --> 21:34.989
but then the worst part
will be over.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.569
(gasps)

21:42.470 --> 21:44.608
Why is Billie doing an EMG
on our patient?

21:44.675 --> 21:46.879
You mean my patient,
and this is the only way

21:46.946 --> 21:49.317
to pinpoint where Marty's
weakness is coming from.

21:49.384 --> 21:50.352
We know where
her weakness is from.

21:50.452 --> 21:53.025
She has myasthenia gravis.

21:53.125 --> 21:54.662
I'm not so sure about that.

21:54.728 --> 21:57.233
-My gut is telling me
something else is going on.
-Hold up.

21:57.300 --> 21:58.703
You're saying dozens
of neurologists

21:58.803 --> 22:01.509
who've all diagnosed Marty
with myasthenia are wrong,

22:01.576 --> 22:03.546
all because you have
a Spidey-sense?

22:03.646 --> 22:07.253
I'm sure those doctors made
the best diagnoses they could

22:07.320 --> 22:09.290
with the information they had,

22:09.424 --> 22:10.527
but the inefficacies
of the treatments...

22:10.594 --> 22:12.430
This isn't about
the treatments, Pravesh.

22:12.496 --> 22:13.733
This is about you
treating a patient

22:13.800 --> 22:16.772
like one of your little
science experiments.

22:16.839 --> 22:19.310
Look, I know you don't think
I'm a real doctor anymore,

22:19.410 --> 22:22.885
but I am actually trying
to help my patient.

22:23.953 --> 22:26.559
Does that look like
it's helping, Devon?

22:26.659 --> 22:29.999
If you ask me,
all your clinical trials

22:30.099 --> 22:33.171
have desensitized you to
what real harm looks like.

22:33.238 --> 22:36.077
That right there.
That's it.

22:38.248 --> 22:40.620
(pained gasping)

22:45.864 --> 22:48.335
Let's check that balance,
check that balance. Here we go.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.805
Okay, we go one, one.
And two, two.

22:49.905 --> 22:51.107
That'd be three. Okay.

22:51.174 --> 22:52.811
Four! Four! Kick.

22:52.911 --> 22:54.582
Okay, here we go.
(exhaling sharply)

22:54.648 --> 22:56.752
-Kiai. Kiai.
-Gigi.

22:56.819 --> 22:59.858
♪ Why you gotta be
always talking in my face ♪

22:59.992 --> 23:02.664
-♪ <i>Talking in my face?</i> ♪
-Here we go. One.
<i>-Kiai!</i>

23:02.731 --> 23:04.033
Again. One. One.
Come on, right here.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.503
Ah! One more, one more.

23:05.570 --> 23:07.641
Ah, oh, God, you got me.

23:07.708 --> 23:09.410
Oh, God, you got me.
You got me.

23:09.477 --> 23:11.281
-Kiai! Kiai!
-Oh, God.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.884
Oh, so strong.
I'll fight back.

23:12.985 --> 23:14.420
-I'm gonna fight back.
<i>-Kiai! Kiai!</i>

23:14.487 --> 23:16.592
-I'm gonna fight back.
<i>-Kiai!</i>

23:16.726 --> 23:17.628
(phone ringing and buzzing)

23:17.761 --> 23:20.466
Yeah, time-out, time-out.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.203
Phone call.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.438
(grunts)

23:23.539 --> 23:25.376
Hurry back, Dad.

23:25.442 --> 23:29.017
We have more pummeling to do!

23:29.050 --> 23:30.085
Oh, boy.

23:32.557 --> 23:34.294
<i>So, what, you gonna</i>
<i>leave Chastain</i>

23:34.394 --> 23:36.197
<i>and become a karate instructor?</i>

23:36.298 --> 23:37.834
Tae kwon do, technically.

23:37.901 --> 23:39.470
Turns out it's harder
than it looks.

23:39.538 --> 23:40.573
<i>Gigi did that to you?</i>

23:40.607 --> 23:42.376
GIGI:
It wasn't my fault.

23:42.476 --> 23:45.583
The popsicle-stick splint
says otherwise.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.420
<i>How are things going</i>
<i>over there?</i>

23:47.486 --> 23:49.959
(sighs)
How much time do you have?

23:50.059 --> 23:51.762
Talk to me.

23:51.862 --> 23:54.033
<i>I have this patient</i>
<i>who I thought for sure</i>

23:54.100 --> 23:57.507
<i>was misdiagnosed with</i>
<i>myasthenia gravis...</i>

23:57.608 --> 23:59.177
<i>so I did an EMG.</i>

23:59.243 --> 24:01.649
Okay. What did it tell you?

24:01.716 --> 24:03.920
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>It only reconfirmed</i>

24:03.987 --> 24:05.089
her original diagnosis.

24:05.155 --> 24:08.963
You know, I keep asking myself
where the line is.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.969
How far do I push
before what I thought

24:12.036 --> 24:15.510
was helping
is actually harming someone?

24:15.577 --> 24:18.081
Trust your instincts.
What's your gut say?

24:21.121 --> 24:22.557
(exhales)

24:22.624 --> 24:24.093
That I got to keep digging.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.599
<i>Then you have your answer.</i>
<i>I should probably go.</i>

24:26.666 --> 24:29.237
I've got time for about
six more kicks to the chest

24:29.304 --> 24:31.074
before Gigi's ceremony tonight.

24:32.410 --> 24:34.380
Wait, hold on.
Say that again.

24:34.414 --> 24:35.650
<i>Say what?</i>

24:35.717 --> 24:37.320
That I got about
six more kicks to the chest

24:37.386 --> 24:38.723
before Gigi's ceremony?

24:38.823 --> 24:41.662
Keep digging, my friend.
I got to go.

24:43.633 --> 24:46.739
Dr. Pravesh, I know
I said I wanted answers,

24:46.839 --> 24:50.613
but I'm not sure how much more
of this I can take.

24:50.714 --> 24:52.784
I know, Marty.
This'll be the last thing.

24:52.818 --> 24:55.155
I promise.
It'll be painless.

24:57.126 --> 24:59.765
I'll be back.

25:10.553 --> 25:12.557
Listen, I'm sorry
I came on so strong,

25:12.657 --> 25:14.561
but I won't apologize
for what I said.

25:14.661 --> 25:17.233
Neither will I.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.807
I want to hear you out, Devon.

25:20.874 --> 25:23.913
So tell me, what exactly is it
you expect to find?

25:28.523 --> 25:30.292
That.

25:32.363 --> 25:33.900
You're kidding, right?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.605
You know if you do
a full body scan of anyone,

25:36.706 --> 25:37.974
you're gonna find
something somewhere.

25:38.075 --> 25:39.845
It's an incidentaloma.
It doesn't prove anything.

25:39.945 --> 25:42.517
Not yet.
But a biopsy will confirm

25:42.617 --> 25:44.788
that Marty has lung cancer.

25:44.855 --> 25:47.259
Years ago,
a trial was conducted

25:47.359 --> 25:48.796
to study a small-cell
lung cancer

25:48.863 --> 25:51.067
that was known to mimic
neuromuscular symptoms.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.436
All right,
so you're saying

25:52.504 --> 25:54.407
it could imitate
myasthenia gravis.

25:54.474 --> 25:56.044
It's nearly indistinguishable.

25:56.111 --> 25:58.014
But it wouldn't respond
to myasthenia treatment

25:58.081 --> 26:00.920
because it's not
a neuromuscular disease at all.

26:00.987 --> 26:03.125
IRVING:
Well, I'll be damned.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.866
Looks like you're still
a real doctor after all.

26:16.384 --> 26:18.790
(breathing erratically)

26:20.125 --> 26:21.729
(door opens)

26:21.762 --> 26:23.733
JESSICA:
Oh, there you are.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.870
Dr. Sutton's looking for you.

26:25.937 --> 26:27.440
You don't look good,
Dr. Sullivan.

26:27.507 --> 26:30.045
Yeah, just a little heartburn.
I-I must have eaten too fast.

26:30.112 --> 26:32.082
Okay, well,
why don't you sit down?

26:32.183 --> 26:33.653
-You know, I can't,
I got to get going. I'm good.
-I can help you.

26:33.719 --> 26:34.988
-Okay.
-Thank you. Thank you.

26:35.088 --> 26:37.426
Stay here.
I'll get you some water.

26:37.493 --> 26:40.867
Everything's fine.

26:42.236 --> 26:43.506
(door opens)

26:43.606 --> 26:44.942
They're taking Jane to the OR.

26:45.008 --> 26:47.981
-We have to go now.
-Why? What happened?

26:48.048 --> 26:50.018
She's showing signs
of encephalitis.

26:50.085 --> 26:52.824
It's now or never.

26:53.693 --> 26:55.395
All right, 3:55.
I need ten minutes

26:55.462 --> 26:56.799
I'll meet you there.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.569
We don't have ten minutes, Ian,
you know that.

26:58.669 --> 27:01.241
Okay, five minutes.
Start without me.

27:08.121 --> 27:10.727
I have an appointment
for Ian Sullivan, 4:00 p. m.

27:10.827 --> 27:11.929
Our technician is
stuck in traffic,

27:12.029 --> 27:13.365
so we're running a little late.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.035
He's not here?
No, that's not possible.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.939
I have a 4:00 p.m.
It's 4:00 now.

27:17.006 --> 27:18.810
I'm sorry for the delay,
but if you just take a seat...

27:18.943 --> 27:20.145
No, I'm not taking a seat.

27:20.212 --> 27:21.982
I've been waiting all day
for the damn test.

27:22.082 --> 27:24.688
I have a newborn, a little girl
waiting for me right now.

27:24.788 --> 27:26.124
Can we please do the test?

27:26.157 --> 27:28.930
You can fill this out
while you wait.

27:46.130 --> 27:49.070
Will Dr. Sullivan be
joining us?

27:55.249 --> 27:57.019
(sighs)

28:13.051 --> 28:14.988
Okay, let's do this, please.

28:15.022 --> 28:16.926
-Just a few more minutes, sir.
-I just need to pee in a cup.

28:16.992 --> 28:18.896
What could possibly
take so long?!

28:18.930 --> 28:21.735
Just a few more minutes.

28:22.537 --> 28:24.240
(phone chimes)

28:33.759 --> 28:37.032
Oh, screw this.

28:45.883 --> 28:47.654
JESSICA:
Jane's vitals are
starting to dip.

28:47.721 --> 28:50.392
-Should we wait, or...
-No.

28:50.492 --> 28:52.463
Let's get started.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.404
Scalpel to me.

29:05.289 --> 29:06.558
(door opens)

29:06.625 --> 29:08.061
Dad, we need to talk.

29:08.128 --> 29:11.200
I can't right now, dear,
I've got to get going.

29:11.267 --> 29:13.471
Earlier with a patient,
you were having trouble.

29:13.506 --> 29:16.144
You were forgetting things.
And it's been weighing on me.

29:16.244 --> 29:19.718
I've got surgery now, Cade.
I can't do this right now. Okay?

29:19.818 --> 29:21.321
I don't think
you should be operating.

29:21.387 --> 29:23.024
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you

29:23.124 --> 29:25.128
about the Oxaprozin.
Anything I do now

29:25.195 --> 29:26.497
is gonna be under
your little microscope.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.867
Well, can you really blame me.

29:27.934 --> 29:31.341
-I am worried about you.
-Do not patronize me!

29:32.009 --> 29:33.378
Is that why you came in here?

29:33.512 --> 29:36.084
Comb through all my past.
Okay, fine, let's to that, then.

29:36.184 --> 29:38.488
Okay, you're being irrational.
Just calm down.

29:38.556 --> 29:39.490
Do you want me to admit it?

29:39.558 --> 29:40.860
I was a terrible father?

29:40.927 --> 29:41.962
That's what you tell all
your friends, right? I...

29:42.029 --> 29:43.498
You tell them
I was a deadbeat.

29:43.566 --> 29:45.235
-You had to raise
yourself, right?
-No, that's not fair.

29:45.335 --> 29:47.072
-I-I never meant that you...
-You know, Cade,

29:47.139 --> 29:48.676
sometimes you are not
the victim.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.045
Sometimes you are the problem.

29:50.112 --> 29:52.584
You make everyone around you
feel like a failure,

29:52.651 --> 29:54.453
Miss High and Mighty.

29:54.521 --> 29:55.422
Do you have any idea

29:55.523 --> 29:58.529
what having a daughter like that
does to a man?

30:00.032 --> 30:03.471
I'm sorry I'm such
a disappointment to you, Ian.

30:06.879 --> 30:09.283
(door closes)

30:13.793 --> 30:16.397
(sighs)

30:23.111 --> 30:26.351
-(bottle clinks into drawer)
-(drawer slams shut)

30:32.129 --> 30:34.300
-(rhythmic beeping)
-And that concludes time-out.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.170
Does anyone have any questions
before we begin?

30:36.237 --> 30:40.045
Unrelated, but does anybody have
a bidet that they can recommend?

30:40.145 --> 30:45.489
Dr. Nolan, we are ready
to proceed with the splenectomy.

30:45.523 --> 30:46.859
Splenect-away, Dr. Devi.

30:46.959 --> 30:48.161
If you screw up, I'll scrub in.

30:48.228 --> 30:50.365
Just do me a favor and don't

30:50.432 --> 30:54.508
splat yourself
all over the pavement.

30:55.342 --> 30:58.381
Looks like you're flying solo
today, Dr. Devi.

31:01.755 --> 31:05.162
Scalpel.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.877
Oh. About time. (sighs)

31:12.944 --> 31:14.681
(echoing):
Where the hell have you been?

31:14.748 --> 31:17.754
(water running)

31:17.821 --> 31:20.425
<i>(buzzing)</i>

31:20.459 --> 31:24.033
Vitals are dropping.
Should we push more epinephrine?

31:26.370 --> 31:28.809
BILLIE: Look, I don't know
what is going on with you, Ian,

31:28.876 --> 31:30.445
but pull it together.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.552
Jane needs you.

31:36.692 --> 31:39.196
(echoing):
Ian!

31:51.722 --> 31:53.258
(vitals monitor beeps)

31:53.358 --> 31:55.395
-Fever's spiking.
-LEELA: Sepsis is worsening.

31:55.495 --> 31:57.099
We have to move fast.
Clamps to me.

31:57.199 --> 31:59.538
-(alarms sounding)
-Diana's going into A-fib.

31:59.604 --> 32:01.508
You hear those alarms, Devi?
You tried, and you failed.

32:01.575 --> 32:03.445
-I am scrubbing in.
-LEELA: This was always a risk.

32:03.512 --> 32:05.415
Let me get her heart rate
under control.

32:05.449 --> 32:07.520
She's too sick. Stop
the surgery, cardiovert now.

32:07.587 --> 32:10.459
The only way through is to do
the surgery. Stapler to me, now.

32:10.526 --> 32:12.931
If you do not get her rate down,
she is going to...

32:13.031 --> 32:15.435
She's going to make it.

32:21.280 --> 32:24.053
Heart rate
and temperature normalizing.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.957
Great work, Dr. Devi.

32:26.023 --> 32:28.996
LEELA:
See? You can get back

32:29.063 --> 32:31.400
to your bidet now.

32:33.639 --> 32:35.710
With pleasure.

32:35.776 --> 32:38.181
(sighs)

32:40.553 --> 32:44.293
All right, carry your incision
down into the meningeal sac.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.299
That's it.
Mobilize the nerve roots.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.604
JESSICA:
Dr. Sullivan,
this is your specialty.

32:49.671 --> 32:50.873
Dr. Sutton can handle it.

32:50.973 --> 32:53.244
Okay, now use your sutures.

32:53.278 --> 32:57.620
Delicately fold the neural
placode into the spine.

33:03.732 --> 33:08.041
I know my way around a spine,
but not one this small.

33:08.074 --> 33:09.678
Jessica's right.
You should take over.

33:09.744 --> 33:14.019
-You're doing fine.
Just keep going.
-BILLIE: I will.

33:14.086 --> 33:17.192
But if Jane dies
on this table, it's on you.

33:24.273 --> 33:27.212
Okay. 7-0 Prolene to me, please.

33:27.312 --> 33:30.385
Better late than never,
I suppose.

33:30.452 --> 33:32.557
See if you can get me
some exposure here.

33:32.657 --> 33:35.863
Retract the skin edges, please.

33:35.963 --> 33:37.734
(rhythmic beeping)

33:37.800 --> 33:39.370
All right.

33:39.470 --> 33:42.075
-You see that little guy?
-BILLIE: Mm-hmm.

33:42.142 --> 33:44.013
-The filum terminale?
-It tethers the spine,

33:44.113 --> 33:47.085
as you know,
but now we need to cut it, okay?

33:47.185 --> 33:48.522
Place back in the nerves

33:48.622 --> 33:51.127
and then close
the dura and the fascia.

33:51.227 --> 33:53.766
You with me, Sutton?

33:54.801 --> 33:57.172
Lead the way.

33:57.272 --> 33:59.476
Ah.

34:05.488 --> 34:08.796
It's official. You don't have
myasthenia gravis.

34:08.862 --> 34:11.200
But I have cancer.

34:11.267 --> 34:16.177
Yes. A paraneoplastic syndrome
called Lambert-Eaton.

34:16.277 --> 34:18.515
It explains why
your neuromuscular symptoms

34:18.582 --> 34:21.588
were worsening
with the myasthenia treatment.

34:26.163 --> 34:29.905
Look, I know
cancer is never good news.

34:29.938 --> 34:32.543
But now that we know what we're
dealing with, we can fight it.

34:32.644 --> 34:34.948
And we happen
to have excellent weapons

34:34.981 --> 34:36.618
against this particular type.

34:36.685 --> 34:39.223
I'm not going to lie to you,
Marty. It's a long road ahead.

34:39.323 --> 34:41.662
But if we stay the path,
in a few years, there's a chance

34:41.728 --> 34:45.636
that you can gain some
of your independence back.

34:47.306 --> 34:50.078
You mean, I could move out
of my parents' house?

34:53.017 --> 34:54.420
Take care of them for a change?

34:54.453 --> 34:56.758
The point is,
you've had the wrong treatment

34:56.858 --> 34:58.261
for the wrong problem,

34:58.328 --> 35:00.700
and it was only going
to get worse.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.804
Now there's hope.

35:06.612 --> 35:08.448
(sniffles)

35:09.884 --> 35:12.122
Thank you.

35:18.468 --> 35:20.673
(sobs softly)

35:21.875 --> 35:24.279
(sniffles, laughs)

35:24.346 --> 35:28.221
Your training is complete,
young Padawan.

35:28.287 --> 35:30.793
You ready to get
that yellow stripe?

35:30.893 --> 35:32.964
In class last week,

35:33.064 --> 35:35.201
I couldn't break the board.

35:35.268 --> 35:37.306
And some of the kids
laughed at me.

35:37.372 --> 35:38.575
That's not very nice.

35:38.676 --> 35:40.546
We all fail sometimes.
That's how we learn.

35:40.613 --> 35:44.219
But you never fail
at anything, Daddy.

35:44.253 --> 35:46.057
Oh, yes, I do.

35:46.123 --> 35:48.061
All the time. I just...

35:48.127 --> 35:49.764
I just don't give up.

35:49.831 --> 35:53.304
Remember when you thought you'd
never sleep in this bed again?

35:53.972 --> 35:56.344
Because of all the nightmares?

35:57.980 --> 35:59.651
I remember. It was scary.

35:59.751 --> 36:02.523
Yeah, but now you sleep
by yourself every night.

36:02.623 --> 36:06.698
Because you were brave enough
to try again.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.539
It doesn't matter
if you break some stupid board.

36:10.606 --> 36:13.912
What matters is
that you keep trying.

36:13.979 --> 36:16.618
-Capisce?
-Capisce.

36:20.158 --> 36:23.565
(babies crying in distance)

36:23.632 --> 36:26.270
Jane will be okay.

36:26.303 --> 36:28.575
But that could've ended
very badly.

36:28.675 --> 36:31.247
Thanks for holding down
the fort.

36:31.347 --> 36:33.217
I shouldn't have had to.

36:33.284 --> 36:35.790
What happened back there, Ian?

36:36.390 --> 36:38.061
Well, long story short,

36:38.127 --> 36:40.566
I was sick and now I'm not.

36:40.633 --> 36:43.471
Well, someday,
I want the long story.

36:43.572 --> 36:46.010
Because that can
never happen again.

36:46.110 --> 36:47.847
It won't.

36:47.914 --> 36:48.916
I assure you.

36:49.016 --> 36:52.289
Dr. Sullivan, they're waiting
for you in the lab.

36:52.389 --> 36:55.395
Of course. Be right there.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.938
See you tomorrow.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.846
See you tomorrow.

37:08.187 --> 37:10.458
PATIENT:
Excuse me?

37:11.093 --> 37:12.864
Are you a doctor?

37:18.575 --> 37:21.046
The nurse said they were taking
me for an MRI two hours ago.

37:21.147 --> 37:23.384
I'll see what I can find out.

37:33.104 --> 37:34.574
Tell me...
(clears throat)

37:34.674 --> 37:36.978
Mr... Sanchez.

37:37.045 --> 37:39.049
Any history of liver disease?

37:39.149 --> 37:41.487
Kidney problems?

37:42.155 --> 37:43.926
-Any drug use?
-No.

37:44.026 --> 37:45.529
Definitely not.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.900
Great.

37:49.470 --> 37:52.008
Ah. Your urinal's full.

37:52.075 --> 37:54.079
Here, you know what?

37:54.146 --> 37:56.283
Let me help you there.

38:00.626 --> 38:02.597
ADMINISTRATOR:
That's everything.

38:02.663 --> 38:05.703
Enjoy the rest of your evening,
Dr. Sullivan.

38:05.803 --> 38:07.940
Oh, I certainly will.

38:23.939 --> 38:25.275
Where am I?

38:25.375 --> 38:28.114
CADE:
You're in the hospital, Diana.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.517
You had your spleen removed.

38:29.617 --> 38:32.489
But you should be
feeling better soon.

38:35.996 --> 38:38.501
Don't touch me!

38:44.279 --> 38:46.383
Where's my bag?

38:46.518 --> 38:48.856
Did someone take it?

38:48.922 --> 38:51.928
They seized it when you were
admitted, remember?

38:53.130 --> 38:54.499
I need my bag.

38:54.567 --> 38:57.072
I want to... I want out of here.

38:57.138 --> 38:58.775
Your daughter's out of surgery.

38:58.842 --> 39:00.411
She's recovering now.

39:00.513 --> 39:02.482
Did you hear me?
I want to go home.

39:02.517 --> 39:04.386
You're in withdrawal.

39:04.453 --> 39:05.890
You have a long road
to getting clean.

39:05.956 --> 39:08.862
And until you are,
you won't be getting Jane back.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.331
That's bull.

39:10.398 --> 39:11.935
A baby needs her mom.

39:12.002 --> 39:14.641
Not if her mother continues
abusing drugs.

39:15.275 --> 39:16.611
And trust me,

39:16.711 --> 39:19.116
I know what that looks like.

39:20.184 --> 39:23.324
At every soccer game
or piano recital,

39:23.424 --> 39:24.794
Jane will look out
into the crowd.

39:24.861 --> 39:27.800
and see every parent there
but hers.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.104
And she'll hate herself for it.

39:30.171 --> 39:32.710
She'll spend the rest of her
life wondering why her mother

39:32.810 --> 39:36.150
chose a fix over a relationship
with her daughter.

39:37.118 --> 39:39.624
-Get out.
-She'll have a hard time
trusting people,

39:39.691 --> 39:42.563
making friends, falling in love.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.601
Because how could she believe
anyone could love her

39:44.701 --> 39:46.905
if her own mother doesn't?

39:47.773 --> 39:49.544
I'm begging you,
don't do that to Jane.

39:49.611 --> 39:52.082
-She doesn't deserve it.
-Evelyn.

39:56.457 --> 39:58.795
