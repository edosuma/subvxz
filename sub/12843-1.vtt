00:17.023 --> 00:22.781
Go, bear these tiding to great Lucifer.

00:22.950 --> 00:27.598
Say Faustus doth surrender up his soul.

00:27.768 --> 00:32.085
So he will spare him four and twenty years.

00:32.259 --> 00:35.881
To give me whatsoever I shall ask.

00:36.059 --> 00:39.894
To tell me whatsoever I demand.

00:40.067 --> 00:45.611
To slay my enemies and aid my friends.

00:45.785 --> 00:50.534
And always be obediant to my will.

02:07.353 --> 02:10.190
Me again. Ragman.

02:11.371 --> 02:13.291
Well, the song remains the same.

02:13.969 --> 02:15.243
Total conflict.

02:15.816 --> 02:18.244
Them against us.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.901
I can't believe they
canceled the Halloween concert...

02:22.423 --> 02:24.217
It's like you say,

02:24.386 --> 02:27.423
rock's chosen warriors will rule the apocalypse.

02:30.149 --> 02:33.313
Airheads and brain-deads are everywhere.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.197
Who needs them?

02:37.784 --> 02:40.361
What have they got that I need?

02:42.505 --> 02:44.278
Okay. Just one thing:

02:45.469 --> 02:46.469
Leslie.

04:44.074 --> 04:50.072
Sometimes--actually alot lately--I
think about some pretty radical things.

04:51.072 --> 04:55.243
I mean, I have thoughts in my head
that only you could understand.

04:56.627 --> 04:59.880
Why not just end it, be done with it all?

05:01.012 --> 05:02.012
Death.

05:02.723 --> 05:03.722
Gone.

05:06.227 --> 05:07.723
But you know something?

05:09.455 --> 05:11.837
The only thing that holds
me together is you.

05:13.449 --> 05:14.449
You.

05:14.972 --> 05:19.748
You get it, man. You went to this
fucking school, and you rose above it.

05:20.922 --> 05:26.920
And now you're on top.And you can look
down at the anthill and smile.

05:29.238 --> 05:30.522
I gotta go.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.238
Your friend forever...

05:35.641 --> 05:36.653
Ragman.

05:54.356 --> 05:58.430
Good evening. i'm Maggie Wong HernÃ¡ndez, and these are tonight's top stories.

05:58.981 --> 06:04.408
Our special tonight examines
Sammi Curr, a controversial man.

06:05.881 --> 06:08.008
Despite a large teenage following, Sammi Curr,

06:08.109 --> 06:10.290
has recently been the target of much criticism...

06:10.390 --> 06:13.933
for his suggestive lyrics
and onstage theatrics.

06:14.238 --> 06:16.657
Locally, he was the center of a raging controversy just last week

06:16.758 --> 06:19.786
when the town council denied him permission...

06:19.832 --> 06:23.553
to appear at Lakeridge High's Halloween Party Festival Saturday.

06:24.006 --> 06:27.358
Curr graduated from that school
and wished to return to his alma mater.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.175
A move that was very popular among students.

06:30.384 --> 06:33.106
The counsel blocked the attempt, citing obscenity

06:33.118 --> 06:35.614
and violence in Curr's music.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.887
Tonight with us is Ms. Sylvia Cavell,

06:38.899 --> 06:41.435
head of the Lakeridge chapter...

06:41.535 --> 06:44.747
...which blocked Curr's appearance.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.519
- Mrs Cavell..
- Thank you, Maggie.

06:47.715 --> 06:50.645
I've been a teacher for 37 years.

06:50.987 --> 06:55.428
And there is an addiction that is reaching
epidemic proportions in our school.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.555
I am refering to rock music.

06:59.011 --> 07:03.063
I have seen my share of sexual
attitudes and young rebels.

07:03.164 --> 07:05.228
And I know how to deal with them.

07:05.328 --> 07:08.363
Eyewitness News has obtained footage
of Sammy Curr...

07:08.464 --> 07:12.025
before a Senate Committee inquiry of  Rock Pornography.

07:12.289 --> 07:13.446
If you were a parent

07:14.085 --> 07:19.149
would you want your kid to grow up with rock music, rock musicians, that kind of values?

07:19.392 --> 07:23.187
Would you want your kid growing up around politics, politicians, and those values?

07:23.501 --> 07:24.501
Mr. Curr, this is not...

07:24.535 --> 07:29.447
You can not legislate
morality, or music, or people's minds.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.848
- We'll bring you down, man.
- I have a teenaged daughter...

07:31.949 --> 07:33.709
We will bring you down!

07:35.826 --> 07:40.056
Again, Sammi Curr, rockstar,
victim of a fire in a hotel,

07:41.103 --> 07:43.200
dead at the age of 38.

09:00.770 --> 09:03.149
Wake up, sleepy head.

09:04.838 --> 09:09.249
It's party time! Yeah!
This is old Nukesterop coming at you right here!

09:09.261 --> 09:12.836
On this fine Rocktober morning!

09:13.271 --> 09:18.650
It's the sweeping sensation that's sweeping the nation,
and I'm gonna do it to you right here, right now. Wow!

09:20.091 --> 09:21.391
Hey, Ragman!

09:29.954 --> 09:31.072
Hey, kid.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.528
I can't believe it.

09:37.295 --> 09:40.831
Well, live fast, die young, I guess.

09:41.815 --> 09:45.257
He made up some great songs. He spoke to us.

09:45.741 --> 09:46.741
Still does...

09:48.559 --> 09:49.888
alive or dead,

09:50.586 --> 09:51.892
doesn't matter.

09:53.306 --> 09:54.906
Hey, hey, hey, Eddie.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.166
Eddie, he wasn't a God.

09:59.955 --> 10:03.792
- This "rock warrior" bullshit...
- No one understands like me.

10:07.402 --> 10:09.658
Eddie, you didn't know him.

10:10.478 --> 10:13.779
He was angry. He was always
angry, even in high school.

10:13.864 --> 10:14.864
No.

10:16.193 --> 10:17.692
It wasn't him.

10:18.331 --> 10:21.461
He stood up for what he believed in,
and they nailed him for it.

10:21.696 --> 10:23.543
He wanted to play the high school, right?

10:24.027 --> 10:27.588
But no, no, they stopped him.
They--they banned him!

10:27.698 --> 10:30.249
They tried to fuck him over everywhere he went.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.386
And I know what that's like.

10:33.486 --> 10:36.755
Eddie, he did this to
himself, don't you get it?

10:37.939 --> 10:43.521
He started to believe his own hype.
He did it to himself, Eddie.

10:46.987 --> 10:50.704
Goddamned equipment! Can you
believe it? Nothing ever works!

10:59.037 --> 11:02.529
I got something for you.
You know what this is?

11:03.099 --> 11:05.002
It's the last record

11:05.601 --> 11:07.241
of the Curr legacy.

11:10.631 --> 11:13.665
They tried to ban him, but they couldn't stop him.

11:18.866 --> 11:19.984
He's in here.

11:27.624 --> 11:31.374
- Are you going to play it?
- At midnight on Halloween.

11:32.072 --> 11:33.594
That was Sammi's ideai.

11:35.339 --> 11:40.153
- Why's it so heavy?
- It's an acetate. A studio demo.

11:40.946 --> 11:46.162
Eddie, what you've got in your hands
is the only copy in the world.

11:47.509 --> 11:48.508
Yeah.

11:52.281 --> 11:55.057
Alright, come on, let me have that back.

12:00.426 --> 12:05.253
- Here.
- No fuckin' way, man!

12:05.353 --> 12:08.104
You said you gotta play it on Halloween.

12:08.116 --> 12:10.653
I will, I have it on tape.

12:10.753 --> 12:12.311
This is unbelievable!

12:13.217 --> 12:15.467
I think he would've wanted you to have it.

12:16.555 --> 12:17.555
You know?

12:18.720 --> 12:20.130
This is very cool.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.864
This is very cool. Very cool!

12:39.062 --> 12:39.862
Hey, Eduardo.

12:39.963 --> 12:43.878
You had me scared when you didn't show up for Trig.
I figured the Sammi Curr thing had you bummed out.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.397
Yeah...

12:45.819 --> 12:48.508
- I'm okay.
- For real? You're okay?

12:48.879 --> 12:52.463
- I'm okay, okay?
- Okay, I'm okay if you're okay.

12:56.237 --> 12:57.237
Hi.

12:58.085 --> 12:59.580
You're Eddie, right?

13:00.084 --> 13:01.084
Okay.

13:02.545 --> 13:03.245
Yes.

13:03.527 --> 13:05.766
I have something for you.

13:18.849 --> 13:21.505
Tim and the guys, sometimes
their humor is a little...

13:21.605 --> 13:22.605
I know.

13:23.165 --> 13:26.383
- Hey, what are you gonna to do?
- So, are you going to the pool party tonight?

13:27.328 --> 13:28.328
The pool party?

13:29.293 --> 13:34.609
Yeah! Oh, yeah, sure. It's the pool
party... The party at the pool.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.499
Why don't you come by? Around
8:30, right after they close.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.599
Yeah.

13:40.199 --> 13:41.411
It'll be fun.

13:42.178 --> 13:43.742
I just might be there.

13:45.383 --> 13:46.382
Good.

15:38.599 --> 15:39.887
What are you doing here?

15:41.264 --> 15:42.264
Nothing.

15:43.483 --> 15:45.281
Then how about getting the fuck out of here?

15:46.270 --> 15:47.572
I'm meeting someone.

15:48.434 --> 15:49.434
Who?

15:52.332 --> 15:53.332
Hey!

15:53.933 --> 15:55.705
You got ears, dildo?

15:56.884 --> 16:00.170
Wait, I just want to
ask him something, okay?

16:00.641 --> 16:02.718
- Blast off, dude.
- Kim.

16:07.361 --> 16:11.247
Look, doesn't it get tough being this
continuous level of creepiness?

16:11.953 --> 16:14.826
- Creepiness?
- Get lost, metal head.

16:16.378 --> 16:20.462
- Why can't you act normal?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

16:20.636 --> 16:24.031
Wait. If you weren't so creepy,
you'd know what I'm talking about.

16:24.468 --> 16:26.950
Get him the fuck out of here.

16:27.774 --> 16:30.549
Are you interested in running for student council?

16:32.524 --> 16:33.725
Hey! Hey!

16:34.704 --> 16:36.864
Stop, you bastards. Leave me be.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.250
Let go! Get off me!

17:13.025 --> 17:15.698
Hey, metal head! You're in the shallow end.

17:20.423 --> 17:22.300
Way to go, Leslie!

17:26.328 --> 17:27.328
Eddie!

17:28.359 --> 17:29.360
Eddie!

17:29.598 --> 17:30.967
I don't want to talk to you.

17:30.979 --> 17:33.433
My mom's on her way with the car.
If I had known...

17:33.605 --> 17:38.151
Well, that's just tought shit, isn't it! Let's just
all fuck with Eddie, 'cause that's real fun, huh?

17:38.322 --> 17:41.991
- Bunch of fucking assholes!
- I'm sorry.

17:42.163 --> 17:46.709
I'm gonna nail every one of those bastards!
I don't know how, I don't know when...

17:46.880 --> 17:48.839
but I'm gonna nail them.

19:55.202 --> 20:00.332
Let the big fish hook himself.
You're the bait. The bait is you.

20:41.145 --> 20:45.057
- Can we talk about last night?
- You set me up.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.005
Hey, it's Aquaman.

20:59.957 --> 21:01.758
- Hainey?
- Yes, Edward?

21:01.934 --> 21:03.346
Eat this.

21:04.647 --> 21:05.796
You're dead!

21:05.897 --> 21:06.897
Get him!

21:07.096 --> 21:08.095
Grab him!

21:16.942 --> 21:17.942
Get him!

21:31.473 --> 21:32.472
This way!

21:32.473 --> 21:34.259
Come on. Come on.

21:36.340 --> 21:37.340
Grab him!

21:55.864 --> 21:56.864
Move it!

22:16.003 --> 22:17.003
There he is!

22:36.160 --> 22:37.555
Die, sucker!

22:56.104 --> 23:02.030
Let the big fish hook himself.
You're the bait. The bait is you.

23:10.388 --> 23:11.387
So?

23:12.007 --> 23:13.096
What do you think?

23:13.143 --> 23:17.560
It's loud, fast and thrashin'.
Little bit short on the melody, but...

23:17.735 --> 23:21.819
No, no, Roger. The message.
Come on, man, what do you think?

23:22.077 --> 23:25.199
I think it's just ordinary, run-of-the-mill
backmask message.

23:25.375 --> 23:29.429
Just like on "Fuck with Fire,"
"Burning  Metal" and, uh...

23:29.764 --> 23:30.765
"Torture's Too Kind."

23:30.865 --> 23:33.882
Come on, this is not the
same thing, man. Look at me.

23:34.057 --> 23:35.057
You see...

23:35.571 --> 23:38.387
this message is meant for me.

23:38.858 --> 23:43.724
Look, why don't you zoom on down to
Hunan Gardens, pick up some fortune cookies...

23:43.824 --> 23:45.304
then plan out the rest of the week?

23:45.370 --> 23:48.706
Okay. Okay, then explain this:

23:48.877 --> 23:54.172
I do exacty what the message says.
And I nail those assholes the first time ever!

23:54.346 --> 23:57.717
- Just coincidence.
- No, no, that is not a coincidence!

23:57.893 --> 24:02.559
Friend, you have fallen for the biggest
gimmick in the record industry.

24:02.736 --> 24:05.549
Someone exec thought up
the idea of hidden lyrics...

24:05.561 --> 24:08.078
so that pinheads like Eduardo Weinbauer...

24:08.246 --> 24:12.378
would fuck up their records playing them
backwards and have to buy more.

24:12.546 --> 24:17.046
Dude, wake up. Look, I gotta jam.

24:17.221 --> 24:18.221
Bye.

24:24.568 --> 24:30.279
Eddie, your cage is starting to shake loose.
Now if you want to talk, I'm around.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.422
Maybe I am nuts.

25:51.491 --> 25:53.193
Na... Namgar.

26:11.058 --> 26:12.602
Ragman.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.660
Un-fucking real.

26:27.697 --> 26:28.917
This is Ragman.

26:30.436 --> 26:31.839
I have a question.

26:36.547 --> 26:38.936
The message yesterday was for me?

26:44.703 --> 26:46.995
All part of the plan.

26:48.126 --> 26:50.834
Alright. Okay, now we're talking.

26:52.321 --> 26:53.627
Okay, there's a plan.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.140
What is the plan?

27:03.723 --> 27:06.211
Nail them all, remember?

27:06.949 --> 27:08.421
Revenge.

27:08.844 --> 27:09.921
Remember?

27:10.301 --> 27:11.301
Yes.

27:11.660 --> 27:12.668
I remember.

27:14.216 --> 27:17.140
After yesterday, how can I forget?

27:17.394 --> 27:18.619
Quiet.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.032
Yeah?

27:22.119 --> 27:23.582
Eddie, who's in there?

27:24.326 --> 27:25.326
Nobody.

27:26.797 --> 27:28.091
I mean I am.

27:28.551 --> 27:32.541
Would you get to bed? It's
after eleven o'clock!

27:33.489 --> 27:36.299
Damn, wish you would just
leave me alone?

27:42.779 --> 27:48.026
Okay, now em... the plan. You
were going to tell me the plan.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.192
What's the plan?

27:57.473 --> 28:01.771
Metal Machine, 6-6. Crush.

28:01.940 --> 28:06.404
Metal Machine, 6-6. Crush.

28:06.573 --> 28:09.031
6-6. Crush.

29:45.257 --> 29:50.101
Hey, Eddie. We spent the entire
morning on janitorial detail.

29:50.767 --> 29:54.071
You'd be amazed at what people
stick under the desks.

30:07.548 --> 30:09.935
Did the head-banger bang his head?

30:13.945 --> 30:16.235
How can you listen to this shit?

30:20.054 --> 30:22.236
Huh? Huh?

30:26.537 --> 30:29.048
Where're your balls today, Weinbauer?

30:39.414 --> 30:41.789
Do you think I'm a putz?

30:46.469 --> 30:50.006
Do you think I'm a fucking wussy?

30:54.400 --> 30:57.523
No, I think you're confused.

30:59.660 --> 31:03.114
Because you're not gonna get away
with the shit you pulled yesterday.

31:08.161 --> 31:09.406
Oh, shit!

31:15.565 --> 31:16.643
Shut it off!

31:17.819 --> 31:19.778
Turn it off, Weinbauer!

31:22.953 --> 31:24.365
Turn it off!

31:29.882 --> 31:32.589
Turn it off, Weinbauer Turn it off!

31:38.691 --> 31:40.103
Are you okay?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.575
It's not over yet, man.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.426
It's not over yet!

31:59.646 --> 32:02.186
No, not yet.

32:06.618 --> 32:10.916
6-6. Crush.
6-6. Crush.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.053
What do you say there, Sammi, my man?

32:27.740 --> 32:29.818
You and me, man. You and me!

34:26.235 --> 34:27.748
Stop it!

34:46.737 --> 34:48.149
I was...

34:49.451 --> 34:53.452
Your clothes. I was putting them away.

34:54.710 --> 34:55.710
Thanks.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.480
They're clean.

36:06.261 --> 36:11.639
They banned him from playing his
old high school. Lakeridge's own Sammi Curr.

36:11.812 --> 36:18.569
He is the subject of our special midnight
tribute tomorrow, right here on WZLP.

36:19.703 --> 36:22.790
"Tim, A peace offering. Eddie."

36:45.844 --> 36:48.643
Edward, hey... Edward, where you were
this morning? You missed the midterm.

36:48.807 --> 36:53.604
- So? I'll make it up.
- You can't. You flunked. Double goose-eggs.

36:53.774 --> 36:56.613
- Big deal.
- Get a grip on yourself, man.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.986
Forget this vendetta thing.
Dude, this is total Darwin.

37:00.161 --> 37:03.829
Survival of the fittest. You wanna live,
you suck up to the fittest.

37:04.002 --> 37:06.657
No. Never again.

37:06.758 --> 37:07.758
Eddie.

37:07.926 --> 37:11.200
Hi, I heard about you and Tim.
Are you okay?

37:11.994 --> 37:12.793
Am I okay?

37:12.894 --> 37:15.667
He doesn't remember it.
Traumatic amnesia.

37:16.693 --> 37:20.610
This outfit, I love it. What are those?

37:20.784 --> 37:21.783
Jeans.

37:22.845 --> 37:23.845
They're you.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.212
Gotta go. Ciao.

38:17.893 --> 38:19.871
Later. I gotta go.

41:22.586 --> 41:23.585
Genie?

41:28.860 --> 41:29.859
Genie?

41:31.277 --> 41:32.276
Genie?

41:33.020 --> 41:34.020
Genie?

41:40.774 --> 41:41.773
Genie?

41:55.652 --> 42:00.447
And next week we'll have in the studio
a fine talent and beautiful personality...

42:00.619 --> 42:03.372
Miss Muffy Singleton.

42:03.541 --> 42:07.874
Now we're back with evangelist and moral
crusader Rev. Aaron Gilstrom...

42:08.049 --> 42:12.430
who's stopped by with some visual aids. We're
talking today about Rock Pornography.

42:12.599 --> 42:15.806
I have to agree with you. We have
some pretty ribald stuff here.

42:15.981 --> 42:19.649
Those rockers really have a
strange sense of humor.

42:19.822 --> 42:24.037
I don't think it's sense of
humor. I think they are sick...

42:24.205 --> 42:30.379
and they're trying to make everyone
who listens to their music as sick as they are.

42:30.550 --> 42:34.097
Reverend, let me ask you.
This album, "Do It Like a Dog"...

42:34.109 --> 42:37.518
This has to be about animal
behavior, is that right?

42:37.687 --> 42:42.633
Let me give you an example. I have one
of the lyrics. Tell me what you think it's about.

42:42.734 --> 42:43.934
Go right ahead.

42:44.075 --> 42:48.825
"Gonna drive my long steel
missile down on your love channel...

42:49.001 --> 42:53.382
Deep, deep, you'll beg for more.
Raising hell and serpents score.

42:53.551 --> 42:59.676
"Feel me, feel me." Now what does that
mean to you? To me it's just a sexual act.

43:17.504 --> 43:18.504
Weinbauer!

43:24.700 --> 43:25.700
Weinbauer!

43:31.521 --> 43:32.833
Weinbauer!

43:41.165 --> 43:44.523
Son of a bitch, what did you do to her?
What the hell did you do to her?

43:44.744 --> 43:45.954
What do you mean, Tim?

43:46.650 --> 43:49.472
She's in the fucking hospital, man.
You could have fucking killed...

43:58.196 --> 44:00.384
You did something to that tape.

44:00.452 --> 44:03.180
I don't know what you did, but you're
getting into some weird fucking shit, man!

44:04.582 --> 44:07.159
I want you to stay away
from me, okay?

44:09.050 --> 44:11.210
Just stay the fuck away from me!

44:34.299 --> 44:35.636
Eddie, who was that?

44:37.728 --> 44:38.857
A friend.

45:14.171 --> 45:16.009
What happened to Genie?

45:21.048 --> 45:23.720
I have to know what happened to Genie.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.039
Cheap thrills.

45:36.572 --> 45:38.028
I'm really starting to get worried.

45:40.036 --> 45:41.310
Tell me. What did we did to her?

45:42.001 --> 45:43.193
What did we did to her?

45:44.254 --> 45:45.495
Nail them all.

45:46.006 --> 45:50.674
Come on, man. She is in the
hospital. This is very serious!

45:54.654 --> 45:56.550
We can't just go and...

45:56.651 --> 45:57.929
Nail them all. Nail them all!

45:57.968 --> 45:58.831
Fuck'em!

46:11.591 --> 46:12.213
I think we should end it.

46:16.308 --> 46:17.474
I don't wanna do anymore.

46:17.775 --> 46:21.367
No end. No fuck metal.

46:22.777 --> 46:23.777
No.

46:24.354 --> 46:26.203
No, it's over now.

46:28.373 --> 46:30.283
No more, okay?

46:32.596 --> 46:33.596
Okay?

46:36.053 --> 46:37.165
Leslie.

46:39.796 --> 46:40.796
What?

46:44.359 --> 46:45.772
What did you say?

46:48.283 --> 46:49.645
Leslie.

46:49.746 --> 46:53.253
Oh, man, come on. Leslie
has nothing to do with this.

46:53.419 --> 46:55.134
She set you up.

46:55.380 --> 46:59.011
No, no, she didn't. She had no idea!

46:59.180 --> 47:00.403
Leslie!

47:00.901 --> 47:01.901
No!

47:07.155 --> 47:07.855
Eddie?

47:07.946 --> 47:09.466
No, not now.

47:09.767 --> 47:12.415
Let her in. We'll nail her too.

47:12.728 --> 47:15.378
Tim Hainey's father is on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

47:15.973 --> 47:17.211
Take a message.

47:17.547 --> 47:19.335
What am I, your secretary?

47:19.736 --> 47:23.365
Mom, I can't talk to anybody now.
Please, just go away.

47:23.684 --> 47:26.307
Mom, can you come in here?

47:28.693 --> 47:29.982
No, don't come in.

47:30.083 --> 47:30.882
What?

47:30.905 --> 47:31.919
Mom, do not come in here.

47:32.020 --> 47:33.977
Please come in, Mom.

47:34.620 --> 47:37.891
Please, do not come in here, Mom!
Don't come in!

47:38.330 --> 47:39.538
Please, go in.

47:39.613 --> 47:40.312
Eddie.

47:40.372 --> 47:44.802
No, Mom. Don't! Look, I can't do
anything right now, alright?

47:44.973 --> 47:50.220
- You're sweating. Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine. You know, I'm tired.

47:50.400 --> 47:53.403
- But you have a fever.
- No, really, I'm fine.

47:53.572 --> 47:59.616
- I'll get some aspirin.
- No, Mom... Okay, aspirin. And soup.

51:48.225 --> 51:52.179
Demonic beasts! What happened to the
good old, smiple love songs?

51:52.358 --> 51:59.696
I love you. That's a good word. Nowadays, they
have to write sickness. Sick and bizarre...

51:59.872 --> 52:03.541
and I'm going to do my utmost best
to try and stop it now!

52:03.713 --> 52:05.640
Anything you'd like to say in conclusion?

52:06.366 --> 52:09.557
These evil people have got to be stopped!

52:24.106 --> 52:26.383
You should be loyal to your hero.

52:28.164 --> 52:29.513
They can turn on you.

52:31.145 --> 52:32.145
Eddie?

52:43.686 --> 52:44.686
Eddie?

53:10.646 --> 53:11.645
Eddie?

53:24.572 --> 53:26.743
What have you done to your stereo?

53:28.805 --> 53:29.925
I wanted a new one.

53:35.159 --> 53:36.016
Mackus residence.

53:36.117 --> 53:37.230
Roger, it's Eddie.

53:37.320 --> 53:38.183
Hold please.

53:38.284 --> 53:39.283
Roger.

53:39.600 --> 53:40.890
Roger, Roger.

53:41.830 --> 53:42.530
Edward?

53:42.588 --> 53:43.936
What the fuck is going on?

53:44.037 --> 53:46.092
We just got call waiting.
Pretty cool, huh?

53:46.220 --> 53:47.558
I feel like a total bigwig.

53:47.659 --> 53:52.142
Roger, I really need your help,
okay? It is incredibly important.

53:52.274 --> 53:56.987
- What is it?
- Tim has a cassette tape, probably in his car.

53:57.058 --> 53:58.057
What about it?

53:58.072 --> 53:59.683
I need you to go get it.

54:00.982 --> 54:05.792
- You've got the death wish. Why don't you get it?
- I can't go get it! Okay, listen, Roger...

54:05.966 --> 54:11.807
If I leave the house, I'll really blow it with
my mom. I'm grounded through Halloween.

54:11.977 --> 54:13.264
She's freaking out!

54:13.669 --> 54:14.669
About what?

54:15.233 --> 54:18.439
I'll explain later. The tape is
really shiny. You can't miss it.

54:18.614 --> 54:22.746
And when you find it, you've got
to destroy it! Do you hear me?

54:22.914 --> 54:28.058
And if you don't find it, call me
back, okay? I'm counting on you.

54:28.532 --> 54:33.333
Okay, I'll wait for your call.
Okay, Roger. I'll talk to you later.

54:33.703 --> 54:34.709
Okay, bye.

54:36.882 --> 54:37.893
Hi, Mom.

54:54.101 --> 54:56.091
I am gonna get killed.

54:56.563 --> 54:58.273
I am gonna die.

55:52.478 --> 55:53.178
Yeah?

55:53.211 --> 55:54.413
Roger, did you get the tape?

55:54.514 --> 55:55.513
Yes.

55:56.008 --> 55:57.008
Did you destroy the tape?

55:57.103 --> 55:58.102
Yes.

55:58.387 --> 56:03.267
You did? Oh, Roger, man. I owe you my life.

56:03.438 --> 56:04.895
What's the big deal with the tape?

56:04.958 --> 56:06.799
It's kinda hard to explain.

56:07.737 --> 56:10.694
It was something pretty awesomely unbelievable.

56:10.869 --> 56:12.576
Listen, Edward. I gotta go.

56:13.178 --> 56:15.618
Okay, well, thanks again.

56:16.246 --> 56:17.386
Okay, bye.

56:22.349 --> 56:24.426
That guy is a quart low.

56:39.088 --> 56:40.709
Not so abnormal.

57:29.017 --> 57:30.214
Hey, Rog.

57:47.148 --> 57:51.149
The reports indicate that Gilstrom
died of a cerebral hemorrhage...

57:51.323 --> 57:52.926
...leading to speculation that he may have...

57:53.027 --> 57:54.027
Roger.

57:54.495 --> 57:56.464
I am a big fan of yours. I have all your records.

57:56.565 --> 57:57.565
Shut up.

58:00.715 --> 58:04.020
Play my tape for me tonight...

58:05.603 --> 58:06.862
or die.

58:07.478 --> 58:11.728
- Lady Cavell?
- It is a very sad day for us.

58:11.903 --> 58:13.315
But as a teacher...

58:20.293 --> 58:23.087
Dude, you got it, absolutely.
And what a great album it is...

58:23.188 --> 58:24.188
Tonight!

58:32.442 --> 58:35.233
Alright, guys and ghouls, Halloween is here.

58:35.406 --> 58:39.359
And hang on tight, because
we're gonna rock you tonight.

58:57.058 --> 58:59.219
Die, commie pig.

59:00.356 --> 59:02.185
Mom, Stan's here.

59:07.662 --> 59:10.618
What a hunk! I love it!

59:15.134 --> 59:19.795
- You sure you're alright?
- Fine. You go out and have a good time.

59:20.853 --> 59:24.141
You're still grounded, but we'll start
with a clean slate tomorrow.

59:24.317 --> 59:27.796
Honey, pass out the bowl of candy
to the little trick-or-treaters.

59:28.049 --> 59:29.511
- Okay.
- You're an angel.

59:30.125 --> 59:31.124
Bye!

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:22.190
Judas?

01:00:22.777 --> 01:00:25.386
- Leslie.
- Are you playing some Judas Priest?

01:00:25.991 --> 01:00:29.160
- Great costume.
- Oh, thanks.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:35.397
- Where's Eddie?
- Eddie?

01:00:36.492 --> 01:00:37.514
He's not here.

01:00:37.554 --> 01:00:40.956
I mean, I guess he's not
here. Have not you seen?

01:00:41.227 --> 01:00:44.266
- No, I asked you.
- No, I haven't seen him.

01:00:48.449 --> 01:00:50.777
Okay. Well, have a good time.

01:01:23.992 --> 01:01:26.283
Death is preferable to this shit.

01:01:33.243 --> 01:01:36.109
- Trick or treat. Smell our feet.
- Come back tomorrow.

01:01:38.976 --> 01:01:39.676
Hello.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.998
Hi, it's Leslie. Happy Halloween!

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.098
Hi!

01:01:43.636 --> 01:01:45.108
Are you coming to the party tonight?

01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:48.785
No, I... I'm sick.

01:01:49.228 --> 01:01:50.534
Oh, sorry.

01:01:51.617 --> 01:01:53.546
I was thinking of going pretty soon too.

01:01:53.647 --> 01:01:55.737
My costume is unraveling.

01:01:56.123 --> 01:01:56.822
What's that?

01:01:56.912 --> 01:01:58.747
Well, it's kind of this...

01:01:58.847 --> 01:02:00.930
No, the music! What's the music?

01:02:01.231 --> 01:02:02.231
Music?

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.710
I don't know. Something Roger put on.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:07.620
Eddie?

01:02:09.232 --> 01:02:10.232
Hello?

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.555
Trick or treat, smell my feet!

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:18.277
Whoa!

01:02:28.258 --> 01:02:30.183
Going to a party?

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.307
I don't think so.

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.214
No, no! Get out of the way!

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:02.319
Shit.

01:03:26.616 --> 01:03:27.868
Oh, shit.

01:04:29.368 --> 01:04:30.368
Oh, shit.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.327
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

01:05:11.192 --> 01:05:13.491
Excuse me, may I have your attention, please?

01:05:15.928 --> 01:05:18.815
- Eat it, Wimbley!
- Yeah, Wimbley, eat it raw!

01:05:19.894 --> 01:05:22.434
Could you please turn that off?

01:05:23.979 --> 01:05:24.795
Turn it off!

01:05:28.243 --> 01:05:31.662
- Thank you.
- So long, wormbag!

01:05:33.127 --> 01:05:37.377
I'd like to welcome all of you
to our annual Halloween dance.

01:05:37.552 --> 01:05:41.387
I'm sure those of you in my
class are tired of listening to me...

01:05:41.559 --> 01:05:47.270
...so we'll go on with our live entertainment.
Without further ado, here they are. The Kickers!

01:05:52.997 --> 01:05:54.576
How you all doing?

01:06:19.995 --> 01:06:21.526
Rock and Roll!

01:08:35.837 --> 01:08:39.112
- This is great!
- Better than the real Sammi!

01:11:44.078 --> 01:11:45.658
What are you doing here?

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:49.120
I have a question for you.

01:11:51.801 --> 01:11:54.175
Are you making it with Weinbauer?

01:12:08.089 --> 01:12:09.088
Roger!

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:12.503
Oh, man. Roger, what did you do?

01:12:13.675 --> 01:12:15.835
Roger, where's Leslie?

01:12:16.539 --> 01:12:17.870
He tried to kill me!

01:12:19.503 --> 01:12:25.179
The he put Genie in the hospital with his
voodoo-witchcraft or whatever it is!

01:12:29.272 --> 01:12:31.646
I just don't want to see you
get hurt too, Leslie.

01:12:31.818 --> 01:12:36.400
Okay, listen, you gotta go in there,
and find the main breaker box...

01:12:36.576 --> 01:12:38.452
...and throw the power off.

01:12:41.737 --> 01:12:42.736
Now!

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:54.770
Leslie?

01:12:54.986 --> 01:12:57.824
Please, Tim. Stop it!

01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:05.844
Come on, Leslie. Come
on. You did it once.

01:13:08.093 --> 01:13:10.011
You are such an asshole!

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.314
You okay, Leslie? Hey, Leslie, look...

01:13:30.837 --> 01:13:31.837
Leslie?

01:13:40.612 --> 01:13:41.611
Leslie?

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.735
- Tim?
- Weinbauer?

01:13:48.907 --> 01:13:51.945
What are you doing?
We have to get out of here!

01:13:51.971 --> 01:13:53.977
Weinbauer, stay away from me!

01:13:57.172 --> 01:13:59.250
Oh, shit! Come on! Now!

01:14:00.386 --> 01:14:01.386
Come on!

01:14:05.977 --> 01:14:06.976
Look out!

01:14:55.947 --> 01:14:59.402
- We gotta find the circuit breaker and kill the power!
- Why?

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:02.037
- So we can stop him!
- Who?

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.435
Wait. Wait a minute. That's it.

01:15:23.773 --> 01:15:24.773
Eddie.

01:15:28.032 --> 01:15:29.474
We had a deal.

01:15:31.246 --> 01:15:32.658
You and me, man.

01:15:38.552 --> 01:15:39.552
Roger!

01:15:39.753 --> 01:15:40.553
Roger!

01:15:40.598 --> 01:15:44.813
- Forget it! It's too late!
- Let me get one thing right!

01:15:46.107 --> 01:15:47.687
Run, Roger!

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.240
Roger?

01:16:08.107 --> 01:16:10.083
Oh, my God. Roger!

01:16:10.486 --> 01:16:13.324
Roger, man. Oh, man, Roger!

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:20.223
He's dead.

01:16:21.924 --> 01:16:24.963
Actually, I'm not.

01:16:27.017 --> 01:16:34.235
Oh, God, it was awful. This guy was
shooting stuff out of his guitar.

01:16:34.406 --> 01:16:39.618
And people were running...
My very best friend, she was...

01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:43.838
- Okay, what did this suspect look like?
- I told you, it was Sammi.

01:16:44.006 --> 01:16:47.877
- Who is Sammi?
- Sammi Curr, the Rock singer?

01:16:49.267 --> 01:16:51.438
Sammi Curr died last week.

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:56.066
Looks like we better
check out the party punch.

01:16:56.237 --> 01:17:00.024
It's crazy. Wierd stuff's
been happening all week...

01:17:01.513 --> 01:17:04.268
Excuse me, could we get
some help here, please?

01:17:05.396 --> 01:17:08.934
Hey, that's the guy right there!
Eddie Weinbauer!

01:17:09.111 --> 01:17:10.523
Hey, you!

01:17:11.908 --> 01:17:13.653
Hold it! Hold it right there!

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:18.372
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

01:17:18.545 --> 01:17:21.252
- Why?
- I don't know!

01:17:39.417 --> 01:17:41.709
Wait up!

01:17:46.472 --> 01:17:52.313
Come on. Let's start from square one, alright?
I want to know the whole story.

01:17:52.483 --> 01:17:54.774
Alright, okay. Fine.

01:17:56.741 --> 01:18:01.122
You've heard of raising spirits from
the dead by incantations, right?

01:18:01.291 --> 01:18:03.000
- I guess.
- Alright.

01:18:05.071 --> 01:18:07.921
- I did that by playing a record backwards.
- You're kidding.

01:18:08.096 --> 01:18:10.885
- I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- No, no, no, I believe you.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.228
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:17.594
He only comes out when I play the record
backwards, and I destroyed the copies.

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:18.863
So he's gone?

01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:20.945
I think so.

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.911
Where did you get this record?

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:31.239
Nuke. There's a midnight tribute. Come on!

01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:36.306
Operator, connect me to WZLP. It's an emergency.

01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:39.336
- What time is it?
- 11:59.

01:18:39.705 --> 01:18:42.342
This is an extreme emergency!
Extremely extreme!

01:18:42.354 --> 01:18:44.451
What happens if he plays it over the air?

01:18:44.622 --> 01:18:47.657
I don't know. He can come out of
anything that picks up a signal anywhere.

01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:50.462
A radio, stereo, anything.

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:03.471
Come on. Nuke!

01:19:13.309 --> 01:19:15.386
- Alright, we gotta get over there.
- In what?

01:19:15.563 --> 01:19:17.241
My mom's car. Come on.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.413
It is midnight mayhem with the Nuke,
on the mighty ZLP.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:29.461
Tonight in our midnight tribute, we're
do something just a little bit special.

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:32.968
We have got a treat for you,
a world premiere!

01:19:33.138 --> 01:19:36.427
The only Sammi Curr album never released.

01:19:36.603 --> 01:19:41.898
So here we go, in the true spirit of
Halloween, the eve of the dead...

01:19:42.071 --> 01:19:46.367
...we're gonna play this first cut
backwards. Crank it up!

01:19:53.198 --> 01:19:54.198
Oh, no.

01:20:01.525 --> 01:20:02.636
Did you hear that?

01:20:04.821 --> 01:20:06.663
Where's it coming from?

01:20:10.457 --> 01:20:11.569
Come on!

01:20:16.051 --> 01:20:19.305
This is 7 Baker requesting
backup at 4th and Chester.

01:20:19.475 --> 01:20:24.140
Have visual of suspect matching description
of Edward Weinbauer and female companion.

01:20:25.277 --> 01:20:29.574
I also have one strange son of a bitch...

01:20:36.088 --> 01:20:39.606
Freeze your ass, buddy, or I'll give
you a jolt you'll never forget!

01:21:09.307 --> 01:21:10.395
I don't see him.

01:21:13.785 --> 01:21:15.496
...your latest fixation...

01:21:37.327 --> 01:21:40.533
Go upstairs and get my keys.
They're in my pants. Hurry!

01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:14.224
Jesus, couldn't you have just opened
the door? I almost had a heart attack!

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.980
- Did you find the keys?
- No.

01:22:19.665 --> 01:22:20.943
They must be in the bathroom.

01:23:15.436 --> 01:23:17.513
Okay. Alright, I've gott'em.

01:23:26.188 --> 01:23:27.188
Oh, my God.

01:23:36.126 --> 01:23:37.126
Eddie.

01:24:26.732 --> 01:24:27.732
Wait here.

01:24:43.128 --> 01:24:44.164
Eddie.

01:25:01.172 --> 01:25:06.418
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

01:25:08.011 --> 01:25:09.011
Follow me.

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:52.388
- Look out!
- No problem.

01:26:02.668 --> 01:26:04.058
I've always wanted to do that.

01:26:43.409 --> 01:26:44.408
Come on.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.277
Eddie, this is suicide. He could be in there.

01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:09.797
You don't understand. I
started this. It's all my fault.

01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:15.632
- I've gotta do something. You wait here.
- No, wait.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.366
My God, what is this?

01:28:00.178 --> 01:28:04.974
- Where's Sammi?
- I don't know. He could be anywhere.

01:28:05.145 --> 01:28:07.724
You know what he's doing now?
He's protecting the tape.

01:28:09.023 --> 01:28:11.507
Goddammit, I let this happen!

01:28:17.761 --> 01:28:18.761
Come on.

01:28:28.404 --> 01:28:32.020
Okay, this is what I need you to do.
Stand here and count to 100.

01:28:32.286 --> 01:28:34.942
If he comes out after you,
you'll have time to run.

01:28:34.968 --> 01:28:38.236
If he doesn't, I need you to run
in there and destroy the tape.

01:28:38.381 --> 01:28:39.381
Alone?

01:28:40.476 --> 01:28:43.075
You'll be alright if you do
what I say. You have to.

01:28:43.433 --> 01:28:45.557
Okay. What about you?

01:28:50.112 --> 01:28:51.604
Maybe I'll see you later.

01:28:53.002 --> 01:28:54.001
Wait!

01:28:54.302 --> 01:28:56.307
What do you mean, maybe?

01:29:00.547 --> 01:29:01.829
Alright, gentlemen...

01:29:03.312 --> 01:29:04.690
...start your engines.

01:29:23.423 --> 01:29:26.925
1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi,
3 Mississippi...

01:29:29.726 --> 01:29:30.835
So where are you?

01:29:32.815 --> 01:29:37.477
What's the matter? You're Rock's chosen
warrior. Now, show me your stuff.

01:29:38.451 --> 01:29:39.451
I know you can hear me.

01:29:39.496 --> 01:29:45.279
16, 17, 18...

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:50.928
How about that toilet, huh? You
looked a little flushed back there.

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:55.931
You sure you feel okay?
Huh, dead man? Come on!

01:29:59.531 --> 01:30:03.201
40, 41, 42...

01:30:03.373 --> 01:30:05.167
I realized something tonight.

01:30:07.052 --> 01:30:08.554
I don't need you anymore.

01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:14.613
You need me. 'Cause what
are you without your fans?

01:30:16.606 --> 01:30:19.078
Who's gonna buy your
records when we're all gone?

01:30:20.153 --> 01:30:21.912
What're you waiting for? Come on!

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:25.452
54, 55...

01:30:25.622 --> 01:30:28.709
Come and get me, man.
Come and get me.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.634
56, 57...

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:36.431
I can't believe this! Where are
you? What're you waiting for? Come on!

01:30:36.601 --> 01:30:41.496
You want to kill me? Here I am. Kill me!
It's just me against you now, man!

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.599
What are you afraid of?

01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:47.484
Rock's chosen warrior is nothing
but a fucking wimp poser!

01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.480
90...

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.605
99, 100.

01:31:12.034 --> 01:31:14.123
Hope you can swim, sucker!

01:32:01.756 --> 01:32:03.182
Woo-hoo!

01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:05.283
Wake up, sleepy heads.
It's party time.
