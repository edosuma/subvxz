the main thing.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.528
That's my main motivation
behind it.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.701
My gym's called Resilience
Training Center,

12:16.737 --> 12:18.536
and it's in Footscray,
Melbourne.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.772
So most of the top fighters
in almost every weight class,

12:20.807 --> 12:23.475
we kind of meet up and train
together three times a week.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.781
Yeah.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.182
Fighting comes naturally to me.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.251
It's just something that,
where I grew up,

12:33.286 --> 12:36.821
we do that our whole lives.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.656
[ Man laughs ]

12:38.692 --> 12:42.127
I think about having
my first UFC fight all the time.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.295
I just can't wait
to be there in the cage,

12:44.331 --> 12:47.031
have some clothes
with my name on the back

12:47.067 --> 12:49.234
in front of the whole world
and just get to show off

12:49.269 --> 12:52.537
what I love to do
in front of everyone.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.738

I'm drinking some Jack.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.359
Hey, Mo.
Why you mad, bro?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.327
I'm not mad.
I just don't like Guapo.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.429
They just so fake to me.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.799
They're so fake.
They're so fake.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.101
Did he say something to you?
No, it's not
that I don't like him.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.571
It's, like, so, I met him
at tryouts, right?

13:26.606 --> 13:28.206
At tryouts,
we was all good.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.742
Greene: At the tryouts,
me and Juan hung out, you know?

13:30.777 --> 13:33.344
We hung out a lot.
We hung out by the pool.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.814
We -- You know, we talked.

13:35.849 --> 13:40.084
We hung out a lot, and I thought
that, you know,

13:40.120 --> 13:44.722
regardless if we were on the
same team or not, we'd be cool.

of genuine people on the show,

13:51.665 --> 13:53.431

he was one of them.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.233
But through the experience
of being in the house,

13:55.268 --> 13:56.634
I know it creates
a lot of tension

13:56.670 --> 13:58.970
'cause we're together, and
we're on two different teams,

13:59.005 --> 14:01.739

a genuine person.

19:45.852 --> 19:46.984
I can see where
he's coming from,

19:47.020 --> 19:48.886
but I think it's just a --

19:48.922 --> 19:50.888
It's only a little, tiny bit
of miscommunication there,

but it's kind of built up
over time.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.825

but, man, I really --

19:54.861 --> 19:56.861
I don't trust people
to begin with.

Imagine if there's some --
The biggest guy is, like,

20:00.300 --> 20:03.100

how that's annoying.

I'm trying to be.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.074
Juan's handling the situation
really, really well.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.843
To have that kind of negativity
towards you in the house,

20:12.879 --> 20:15.046
I know it must be hard. Like,
it's already hard being in here.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.014
You're away from your friends.
You're away from your family.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.683
You're away from home.

It must suck for Juan,

20:22.655 --> 20:24.388
but he's handling it
really well.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.490
Maybe it's the barrier.
Maybe it's a barrier.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.093
-It is. Yeah.
-Maybe I'm overreacting,

20:29.128 --> 20:30.328
-but I'm emotional.
-You know what?

20:30.363 --> 20:32.263

is like [bleep]

20:32.298 --> 20:34.232

Ben and PM just got in my head,

20:34.267 --> 20:36.934
like, you know,
"Maybe it's a language barrier.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.869
He doesn't really hate you.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.505
He just tries to take himself
out of the situation."

20:41.541 --> 20:44.475
So, finally, the human
comes in me.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.244
You know, I'm not trying to be
the [bleep] no more.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.012
I'm like, "You know what?

20:48.047 --> 20:51.115
Let me go talk to him."

20:51.150 --> 20:54.719
Juan, when you're done,
come talk to me.

want to, come talk to me.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.723

-Fair. So, all I --

22:14.500 --> 22:16.934
Listen. All I want to say
is, can we stop this?

22:16.969 --> 22:18.636
-Let's stop. To me, it's okay.
-I'll stop my [bleep]

22:18.671 --> 22:20.738
You stop your --
You're not even doing nothing.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.740
It's me.
I'm being an [bleep]

22:22.775 --> 22:24.308

22:24.344 --> 22:25.343

Takes him to the ground,
controls him.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.253
Yep, yep, yep!

39:17.289 --> 39:19.489
Very good, very good!

39:19.524 --> 39:23.927
¶

39:23.962 --> 39:26.996
So, at one point,
Ben was able to get out,

39:27.032 --> 39:30.300
put Juan in a guillotine,
but Juan is just so strong.

39:30.335 --> 39:32.235
He was just able
to kind of pick Ben up

39:32.270 --> 39:35.338
from that guillotine position
and kind of suplex him.

39:35.374 --> 39:43.546
¶

39:43.582 --> 39:45.548
Whittaker: Round two starts.
Juan does the same thing.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.817
He goes out there.
He stays on the outside

39:47.853 --> 39:49.486
until he can get in close

39:49.521 --> 39:51.020
and get the takedown.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.957
Tag him!
Tag him! Tag him!

39:53.992 --> 39:58.728
At one point, Ben lands
a big, big punch over Juan.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.664
Juan kind of rattles back up
against the cage,

40:01.700 --> 40:04.033
and then Ben rushes in
a little bit,

40:04.069 --> 40:06.369
and Juan capitalizes

40:06.405 --> 40:08.671
and shoots in
on a low, low single.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.241
[ Indistinct shouting ]

40:11.276 --> 40:13.376
Whoa! Control!
Control!

40:13.412 --> 40:14.744
[ Shouting in Spanish ]

40:14.780 --> 40:16.446
That's it!

40:16.481 --> 40:17.680
Juan's a seasoned vet,
you know?

40:17.716 --> 40:19.482
He's a guy who's been
through the wars.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.151
He knows what to do.
On top.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.153
Control position.
Don't give up position.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.655
Keep him on his back.
Work him down there.

40:25.690 --> 40:28.525
And Juan did that excellently.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.160
After two rounds,
our judged have

40:30.195 --> 40:32.228
a unanimous-decision winner --

40:32.264 --> 40:34.164
Juan Espino.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.266
Perfect.
Perfect. Perfect.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.224
No, no punch?

41:01.259 --> 41:02.425
No, I don't think so.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.626
I have fight in two week.

41:03.662 --> 41:06.629
Feeling pretty heartbroken
at the moment,

41:06.665 --> 41:09.432
disappointed, but...

41:09.468 --> 41:11.067
Yeah, I knew what was
going to happen.

41:11.102 --> 41:14.237
I needed to stop.
I wasn't able to today.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.706
As much as I can get angry
and annoyed and stuff,

41:16.741 --> 41:18.041
it's just -- It's my fault.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.776
I'm going to make sure
I'm better,

41:19.811 --> 41:21.744
and, like my team said
after the fight,

41:21.780 --> 41:23.680
I'm going to make sure that
never, ever happens to me again

41:23.715 --> 41:25.281
in my life.

41:25.317 --> 41:28.318
¶

41:28.353 --> 41:30.420
We're going on a down slope,
you know?

41:30.455 --> 41:32.755
There's no other way around it.
We're going down.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.057
You know,
Rob's won four fights.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.358
I've won three of them,

41:35.393 --> 41:37.427
and so our team's
not looking good.

41:37.462 --> 41:39.295
We're feeling pretty worried,

41:39.331 --> 41:42.298
so now we just need to figure
out where to go from here.

41:42.334 --> 41:50.874
¶

41:50.909 --> 41:59.449
¶

41:59.484 --> 42:03.086
So my featherweight pick is,
from Team Whittaker,

42:03.121 --> 42:05.088
Larissa...

42:05.123 --> 42:10.760
¶

42:10.795 --> 42:12.595
...versus Macy.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.430
Yeah!

42:14.466 --> 42:19.836
¶

42:19.871 --> 42:22.105
Gastelum:
This is one of the style
matchups that I'm excited about

42:22.140 --> 42:25.608
'cause I'm excited
to see Macy fight finally.

42:25.644 --> 42:27.844
She's one of the most
ferocious girls

42:27.879 --> 42:29.879
I've ever trained with,
ever seen.

42:29.915 --> 42:32.682
She's just nasty.
She's just mean.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.684
You know, if she's
the ferocious, mean fighter

42:34.719 --> 42:36.452
that I know she is,

42:36.488 --> 42:40.390
then she'll win that fight
no problem.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.759
Whittaker: Larissa's a great
fighter. She's very smart.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.994
She's got a great
all-around skill set.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.262
I think Larissa has
what it takes

42:46.298 --> 42:48.264
to take the fight
where she wants it to,

42:48.300 --> 42:49.766
to strike her, out-strike her,

42:49.801 --> 42:52.569
and if it goes to the ground,
to beat her on the ground.

42:52.604 --> 42:54.037
A very even fight, I think.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.805
And, yeah, you know, I have
a lot of faith in Larissa

42:55.840 --> 42:57.874
to get the job done.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.410
But what happens on the day
happens on the day.

43:00.445 --> 43:07.050
