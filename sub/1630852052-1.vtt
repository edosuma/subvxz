05:09.518 --> 05:10.936
Mom, I'm trying to eat breakfast.

05:11.019 --> 05:11.937
Almost done.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.692
-Your mustache is really coming in.
-Mom!

05:19.862 --> 05:20.696
Phoebe!

05:23.365 --> 05:24.449
I'm bleeding!

05:24.533 --> 05:25.742
You made me bleed!

05:25.826 --> 05:27.160
You'll live. Phoebe!

05:28.662 --> 05:29.580
What are you doing?

05:29.663 --> 05:33.834
Neighbor's electricity is running out
of phase. I tied in, bumped us up to 220.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.085
Now I can run my lathe.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.421
And you didn't think to ask me?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.923
I mean, you just demonstrate
zero aptitude for science.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.009
-Got it.
-You're better at other things.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.553
-Like quesadillas.
-My hair dryer.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.555
-Your quesadillas are excellent.
-Thank you.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.640
-Now what?
-Mom!

05:49.725 --> 05:52.102
-Really? You don't have legs?
-I'm not an adult.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.774
I'm literally driving
to pick up a check now.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.902
You win lottery?

05:59.985 --> 06:01.653
Kind of. My father died.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.823
Relax. I didn't even know him.
I'm surprised he left me anything.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.325
-Sounds like my father.
-Yeah?

06:06.408 --> 06:09.536
Did your dad abandon your family
and move to the middle of nowhere?

06:10.204 --> 06:11.205
No.

06:11.955 --> 06:17.211
Look, I... I know I have not been
a reliable or consistent tenant.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.463
But if you give me a week
to settle loose ends,

06:19.546 --> 06:21.632
I'll be back with everything I owe.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.260
I can fix that!

06:25.928 --> 06:26.762
Listen,

06:27.304 --> 06:29.264
I wait for you to leave,

06:29.348 --> 06:31.099
then I change locks.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.062
There it is.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.605
This is Summerville.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.692
-This is where your grandfather lived.
-And died.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.986
Come on. Not a single bar?

07:24.069 --> 07:25.779
There'd better be a bar.

07:25.863 --> 07:26.864
That's funny.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.172
"Behold,

07:43.255 --> 07:45.716
there was a great earthquake.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.677
The sun became as black as cloth,

07:48.760 --> 07:50.470
the seas boiled,

07:50.554 --> 07:52.764
the moon became as blood,

07:52.848 --> 07:54.433
the skies fell.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.976
Revelation 6:12."

07:57.352 --> 07:58.353
That was normal.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.857
Maybe it's a good thing
you never met your dad.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.121
Great. You didn't tell us
we inherited a murder house.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.791
And just think.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.252
Now all of this is ours.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.683
Pheebs, be a dear
and break into your grandfather's house.

08:58.914 --> 08:59.915
Nice.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.004
Oh, boy.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.678
Not a single photo.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.237
Rats.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.577
You gotta see the gold mine of junk
I found out back.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.536
Great.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.457
Oh, my God, this is so much worse
than I thought it was gonna be.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.972
Under the dining table now!

09:59.474 --> 10:00.309
Phoebe.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.855
Remember that summer
we died under a table?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.940
Of course this place is built
on a fault line.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.275
Probably just fracking.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.152
It's fracking annoying, is what it is.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.864
It's okay, we're only here for a week.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.201
Give or take.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.163
What does that mean?

10:23.582 --> 10:24.958
It means we're staying.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.503
You said we'd only be here for a week!

10:27.586 --> 10:30.255
Yeah, well,
that was before we got evicted.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.715
You said you had money saved up.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.759
That was before I had children.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.262
To be fair,
you've never been good with money.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.388
Thanks, Pheebs.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.478
What's that?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.396
How am I supposed to know?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.027
Can I help you?

10:58.617 --> 11:01.119
Hi. We're the-- The--

11:02.120 --> 11:03.747
This was my father's place.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.377
Hi.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.337
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:12.464 --> 11:15.008
I'm Janine Melnitz. We spoke on the phone.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.426
I was your father's--

11:16.510 --> 11:18.762
You know, we were friends.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.597
-Very sorry for your loss.
-It's okay.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.308
You knew him better than me.
I should be sorry for your loss.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.728
I just tried to keep the bills paid
on time, that kind of thing.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.898
-Like a money manager?
-There was no money to manage.

11:29.982 --> 11:32.276
He could barely keep the power on.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.112
So he left us nothing?

11:35.195 --> 11:37.906
Well, I wouldn't say that.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.159
There is quite a bit of debt.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.580
Ms. Melnitz,

11:45.163 --> 11:46.290
I'm here to sign forms,

11:46.373 --> 11:49.042
pack the silverware
and leave with a rent check.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.545
Are you telling me
this place is worthless?

11:52.129 --> 11:54.798
You mean,
aside from the sentimental value?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.314
Are you going to that thing later?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.566
-Yeah, probably.
-Where's my order?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.486
I can't believe
a place like this still exists.

12:16.570 --> 12:20.407
Can't believe we have to spend summer
in this heap. We have lives.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.827
-You don't think I have a life?
-No. You're a mom. You live for us.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.091
I'll be right back.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.644
Hey. Maybe you will make
a friend out here.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.854
Make them out of what?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.397
I'm serious.

12:52.481 --> 12:55.317
A new home could be
an opportunity to start fresh.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.527
Keep an open mind.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.627
Two taters, three Spinners,
grilled onions, one no cheese.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.670
Lucky, there's--

13:14.753 --> 13:17.673
-There's something wrong with the meat.
-I don't feel so good, Lucky.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.217
There's something wrong.
He's throwing up the meat!

13:20.926 --> 13:21.927
Cool place.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.263
Yeah, I'll use that.

13:25.806 --> 13:26.932
I don't own it.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.433
I know you don't own it.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.769
You look pretty young to own a business.

13:32.938 --> 13:35.649
I saw the sign out front.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.567
"Help wanted"?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.361
I can be helpful.

13:41.530 --> 13:45.033
Under experience,
you put "friendly" with a smiley face?

13:45.117 --> 13:46.660
I didn't really know what to put.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.454
I don't think "friendly" qualifies
as an experience.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.248
It's a quality, I guess.

13:54.585 --> 13:55.419
How old are you?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.546
Seventeen.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.007
Think you can put in a good word for me?

14:00.090 --> 14:01.800
I can tell them you have a pulse.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.051
My name's Trevor.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.596
-My name's Trevor.
-My name's Trevor.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.015
-Dude, that was great.
-Dude, that was really cute.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.766
You have a chance with her. You really do.

14:14.605 --> 14:15.856
So where you heading?

14:15.939 --> 14:17.482
We're staying, actually.

14:17.566 --> 14:20.319
You know that farmhouse
off the highway with the barn?

14:20.402 --> 14:22.321
Dirt? It was my father's.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.281
Dirt Farmer had a family?

14:25.199 --> 14:26.450
You knew my father?

14:27.284 --> 14:28.911
No one knew your father.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.331
Well, I'm sure he'll be missed.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.332
Nope.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.927
What's up, Casanova?

16:26.820 --> 16:27.654
Damn it.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.664
What?

16:39.458 --> 16:41.335
Come on! Bus leaves in 15!

16:55.182 --> 16:56.225
Hey, Pheebs,

16:56.308 --> 16:58.977
at school today, don't be afraid
to just start a conversation.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.854
Are you kidding me?
That's horrible advice.

17:00.938 --> 17:02.773
You're setting her up for failure.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.442
Hey, how are the jokes coming along?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.487
Why should you never trust atoms?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.949
Because they make up everything.

17:14.326 --> 17:15.702
-That's funny.
-No, it's not.

17:15.786 --> 17:18.079
-You can drop me off here.
-Are you embarrassed?

17:18.163 --> 17:19.204
Yeah. Bye.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.127
Love you!

17:29.383 --> 17:30.759
That almost killed you.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.094
Yeah, with your face.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.971
What's wrong? You love school.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.222
I love learning.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.016
This is a state-sponsored work camp
for delinquents.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.353
Fine. You can help me
scrape asbestos out of the attic.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.190
I'll take my chances
with public education.

17:46.859 --> 17:48.235
Hey, don't be yourself.

17:52.948 --> 17:53.782
You okay?

17:54.867 --> 17:57.870
Yeah. First day. Can you imagine
who they've got teaching summer school?

17:57.953 --> 17:59.621
I can. I teach here.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.874
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:01.957 --> 18:03.500
No, it's okay. It's--

18:04.251 --> 18:07.087
Most of the kids that go here,
they're not very bright.

18:07.171 --> 18:08.005
Hey, Colin.

18:10.048 --> 18:10.883
He's--

18:11.675 --> 18:13.760
I can kind of do whatever I want.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.053
Score.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.054
Right?

18:16.138 --> 18:17.139
Dream job.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.771
Good morning, class.
How's everybody doing today?

18:24.855 --> 18:26.940
My name's Mr. Grooberson.

18:28.692 --> 18:29.860
I know.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.571
You don't wanna be here.
I don't wanna be here either.

18:32.654 --> 18:37.951
Now, apparently,
your school is still operating on VHS,

18:38.035 --> 18:41.663
but I found this gem
in the teachers' lounge.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.207
It's great. It's called Cujo.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.959
It's about a rabid Saint Bernard that--

18:46.043 --> 18:48.378
You know what?
I don't wanna give too much away.

18:48.462 --> 18:51.131
But imagine Beethoven
if he contracted rabies

18:51.215 --> 18:53.425
and just started mauling children.

18:53.509 --> 18:54.676
You'll get an idea.

18:55.636 --> 18:56.512
Enjoy.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.812
Speeding. Three, two, one.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.482
She sits alone.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.777
An outcast, rejected by her peers.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.112
But what is her secret?

19:14.196 --> 19:16.406
Perhaps she's on the run.

19:17.950 --> 19:18.951
On the run...

19:19.952 --> 19:21.828
from herself.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.080
And go.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.125
Actually, my grandfather died.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.878
My mom says we're here
to pick through the rubble of his life.

19:29.962 --> 19:33.465
So you're here to uncover
the mystery of his death?

19:34.049 --> 19:35.342
No.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.969
It was natural causes.

19:37.052 --> 19:41.181
Are you sure it wasn't unnatural causes?

19:41.265 --> 19:42.266
Yes.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.102
Pretty sure it was a heart attack.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.980
The silent killer.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.775
I'm Phoebe.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.402
Cool. I'm Podcast.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.404
Why do people call you Podcast?

19:55.487 --> 19:58.532
I call myself Podcast.
Because of my podcast.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.370
Doing some painting?

20:03.453 --> 20:04.288
Yeah.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.165
Whereabouts you staying?

20:07.666 --> 20:10.127
That old apocalyptic ranch off of 99.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.879
It was my father's place.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.463
Dirt Farmer had a family?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.924
You all called him the Dirt Farmer?

20:16.008 --> 20:17.217
Meant nothing by it.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.804
Man spends every week
working a piece of land...

20:22.055 --> 20:26.393
but never seeding, never watering,
never growing a ding-dang thing.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.020
It's curious behavior.

20:28.687 --> 20:30.063
Great customer though.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.150
He-- He bought some bizarre shit.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.777
Yeah, that sounds like him.

20:59.885 --> 21:00.761
What is this?

21:02.346 --> 21:03.180
Hello.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.809
There's a highly entertaining movie
about a killer dog

21:07.893 --> 21:09.061
happening right over there.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.479
Is this a seismic map?

21:11.271 --> 21:15.484
-Yes. How did you know that?
-Because it's a map of seismic activity.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.694
-Right. But--
-You're a seismologist?

21:18.946 --> 21:21.615
Does that seem so hard to believe?

21:22.199 --> 21:23.909
Figured you for a football coach.

21:28.080 --> 21:28.956
Thank you.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.750
These don't look tectonic or volcanic.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.045
Okay, smarty.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.797
Here, check this out.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.841
This is a volcano, all right?

21:39.591 --> 21:43.387
It builds and crests.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.139
But this is a tectonic earthquake.

21:46.223 --> 21:50.018
Notice a little P-wave
followed by a large S wave.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.064
Yeah, I'm not an idiot.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.149
Clearly.

21:56.233 --> 21:59.486
Well, this is the pattern in Summerville.

21:59.570 --> 22:04.157
Large P-wave, small S wave.
Like an explosion.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.910
-Where is it coming from?
-I don't know. I don't know.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.663
I set up geophones,
but I can't triangulate.

22:09.746 --> 22:10.956
Are you using three?

22:11.039 --> 22:14.251
Yeah. I know how many sides
there are in a triangle.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.545
I just thought you were being obtuse.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.217
Was that a geometry joke?

22:22.301 --> 22:24.303
Yes, that's why I winked.

22:25.721 --> 22:26.680
That's terrible.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.640
No, I loved it.

22:28.724 --> 22:33.604
I mean, somehow, a town
that isn't anywhere near a tectonic plate,

22:33.687 --> 22:37.065
that has no underground volcanic activity,
no fault lines,

22:37.149 --> 22:39.276
no fracking, no loud music even,

22:39.359 --> 22:41.111
is shaking on a daily basis.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.199
Maybe it's the apocalypse.

22:50.787 --> 22:54.708
Twenty-three, 24, 25.

22:55.876 --> 22:58.086
Hey, no-skills. How's inventory?

22:58.170 --> 23:01.006
How's it going?
No, it's not good. It's not good at all.

23:01.715 --> 23:04.092
-Does everyone do this?
-Yeah, it's important.

23:04.176 --> 23:05.677
You okay?

23:05.761 --> 23:07.471
Your lips are literally blue.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.847
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:08.931 --> 23:11.975
-You should borrow my hoodie.
-No, it's fine. Seriously.

23:12.059 --> 23:13.393
It's really masculine.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.395
It's got a wolf on it. Trust me.

23:15.896 --> 23:16.897
Okay.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.612
I'm surprised it fits me.

23:23.695 --> 23:25.489
Yeah, it's my boyfriend's, actually.

23:26.907 --> 23:28.033
Back to inventory.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.413
Okay, we're speeding. Three, two, one.

23:33.497 --> 23:36.792
Yeah, just introduce yourself
and tell me what you ate for breakfast.

23:37.835 --> 23:38.669
Phoebe.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.003
Toast.

23:41.088 --> 23:44.550
Okay, maybe a little more.
Tell me a joke or something.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.301
A joke?

23:49.638 --> 23:52.015
What do you call a dead polar bear?

23:53.851 --> 23:54.977
Anything you want.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.646
It can't hear you now.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.736
That was funny.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.196
You're funny.

24:06.864 --> 24:07.990
Pretty hilarious joke.

24:08.073 --> 24:12.035
Fun fact: Did you know Summerville
has more dead residents than living ones?

24:12.119 --> 24:14.580
Yeah, that's how cemeteries work.

24:14.663 --> 24:17.249
Wertheimers Hardware,
run by the Illuminati.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.126
-Lizard people.
-Lizard people?

24:19.209 --> 24:23.172
Jefferson, Einstein, Beyoncé?
How do you think we got the pyramids?

24:23.255 --> 24:25.090
-Slaves?
-Movie theater.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.466
That one's haunted.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.385
I don't believe in ghosts.

24:29.970 --> 24:30.804
What?

24:31.305 --> 24:32.431
How can you--?

24:32.514 --> 24:35.100
I mean, all the evidence!
You don't believe in spirits?

24:35.851 --> 24:36.768
No.

24:37.686 --> 24:40.856
I think
we're all just kind of meat puppets.

24:42.399 --> 24:45.277
There's something you need to see.
I'll grab my wheels.

24:53.785 --> 24:56.288
-Are we even allowed to be here?
-Oh, yeah.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.456
Totally.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.291
The mine's been closed since the '40s.

24:59.374 --> 25:03.295
They just put all these signs up
'cause of hazardous chemical leaks

25:03.378 --> 25:04.755
and on account of dynamite.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.590
I do this.

25:14.598 --> 25:17.476
The whole town was basically
a mining operation.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.436
They bore out this mountain
like a grapefruit

25:19.520 --> 25:22.606
and smelted everything
into cold-riveted selenium girders.

25:23.190 --> 25:26.652
Why would you make a steel beam
out of an electro conductor like selenium?

25:28.862 --> 25:29.988
Right?

25:30.072 --> 25:30.989
Weird.

25:32.074 --> 25:33.325
Until one day,

25:33.951 --> 25:36.370
they were forced
to close down the whole enchilada.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.496
Why?

25:39.039 --> 25:42.501
One by one,
miners who had worked for years

25:42.584 --> 25:46.463
began leaping down the mine shaft
to their death.

25:46.547 --> 25:51.051
They called it the Shandorian curse.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.783
Who built these?

26:14.867 --> 26:16.243
Depends who you believe.

26:16.326 --> 26:19.162
One day, they just showed up
without explanation.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.000
Cool.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.363
What a shitbox.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.910
So, what's your podcast about?

26:58.702 --> 27:02.372
Mostly mysteries and the unknown,
conspiracy theories,

27:02.456 --> 27:03.874
the occasional restaurant review.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.710
Maybe I could check it out sometime.

27:07.461 --> 27:09.671
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:15.636 --> 27:18.472
The show really finds its voice
on Episode 46.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.556
Okay.

27:20.849 --> 27:21.683
Hey.

27:21.767 --> 27:25.395
Look, this is totally cool
if this is a no. Zero "presh."

27:26.271 --> 27:27.105
But...

27:28.649 --> 27:30.651
do you wanna be my lab partner?

27:32.361 --> 27:36.573
Well, I don't think
we're gonna be doing any labs, but yeah.

27:37.366 --> 27:38.992
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

27:39.076 --> 27:41.245
Cool, cool. All right.

27:42.412 --> 27:43.247
Yeah.

27:45.165 --> 27:46.416
Well, this is me.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.211
The Dirt Farmer's house?

27:49.294 --> 27:51.839
-Yeah, he was my grandfather.
-No way, dude!

27:52.881 --> 27:54.633
So you're just gonna walk in?

27:57.553 --> 27:58.971
Are you recording me?

27:59.054 --> 28:01.765
Yeah, just in case
your body's pulled apart into tiny pieces

28:01.849 --> 28:03.559
by an unseen dark force.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.689
All right. Bye!

28:42.764 --> 28:44.892
Okay, so this is happening.

29:09.833 --> 29:10.709
Hello?

31:25.594 --> 31:26.428
No!

31:29.932 --> 31:32.184
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

31:37.773 --> 31:39.983
I need to know what's lurking inside.

31:40.609 --> 31:41.527
No way.

31:41.610 --> 31:43.987
-Killer replica.
-Totally.

31:44.071 --> 31:45.280
A replica of what?

31:45.822 --> 31:46.698
A trap.

31:48.408 --> 31:49.409
A ghost trap.

31:52.496 --> 31:55.332
How do you of all people
not know about this?

31:55.415 --> 31:56.458
I'm ashamed.

31:57.084 --> 32:01.296
I was obsessed. New York in the '80s,
it was like The Walking Dead.

32:01.964 --> 32:03.674
Then it just stopped?

32:03.757 --> 32:06.093
There hasn't been
a ghost sighting in 30 years.

32:18.188 --> 32:19.189
Wait a minute.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.526
This thing is real?

32:22.609 --> 32:23.902
-Absolutely.
-Maybe.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.905
I found it in my living room.

32:26.989 --> 32:28.365
She lives on the Dirt Farm.

32:28.824 --> 32:30.450
Oh, the really spooky one?

32:30.534 --> 32:32.160
Yeah, the one that says "dirt" on it.

32:33.704 --> 32:35.289
What happened in New York?

32:36.415 --> 32:38.375
The whole city was freaking out.

32:38.458 --> 32:41.837
Then these physicists showed up
with these portable proton accelerators

32:41.920 --> 32:44.631
and blew the roof off
of a Manhattan high-rise.

32:48.802 --> 32:50.095
None of this rings a bell?

32:50.721 --> 32:52.931
It happened 20 years before we were born.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.183
I believe it.

32:54.266 --> 32:57.728
Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

32:59.563 --> 33:00.689
I mean,

33:00.772 --> 33:03.775
your dad never mentioned this?

33:03.859 --> 33:05.194
It's just my mom.

33:05.819 --> 33:06.945
Just your mom.

33:08.780 --> 33:09.698
Cool.

33:10.324 --> 33:11.241
"Cool"?

33:12.242 --> 33:13.994
I wonder if this still works.

33:15.579 --> 33:16.872
Should we open it?

33:27.549 --> 33:28.383
Glasses.

33:28.842 --> 33:31.386
Two millimeters of plastic eye protection?

33:31.470 --> 33:32.763
Are you sure this is safe?

33:32.846 --> 33:33.722
Safe?

33:34.431 --> 33:35.265
No.

33:36.058 --> 33:37.142
No.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.769
History is safe.

33:38.852 --> 33:40.771
Geometry, that's safe.

33:41.980 --> 33:46.902
Science is all particle accelerators
and hydrogen bombs.

33:46.985 --> 33:50.197
Science is giving yourself the plague
and gambling on the cure.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.199
Science is reckless.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.910
Totally! Yes! It's punk rock.

33:54.993 --> 33:57.162
It's a safety pin
through the nipple of academia.

33:57.246 --> 33:59.581
-Ouch.
-Fire it up.

34:08.297 --> 34:09.800
I've always wanted to do this.

35:04.188 --> 35:05.439
Yes!

35:08.275 --> 35:09.776
We should probably get out of here.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.945
You're an adult.

35:12.029 --> 35:12.863
Yeah.

35:13.989 --> 35:15.032
And liable.

35:16.617 --> 35:18.160
You know what this means?

35:19.369 --> 35:21.622
Your grandfather was a Ghostbuster.

35:22.289 --> 35:23.457
Yes, I'm aware.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.610
It has a door and windows,
like any ordinary house.

35:52.277 --> 35:54.029
But the distinct smell of evil...

35:55.906 --> 35:56.949
is prominent.

35:57.866 --> 35:58.992
What are you doing?

35:59.076 --> 36:02.538
Oh, giving a little color.
Setting the mood.

36:03.247 --> 36:04.873
It's creepy. I dig it.

36:11.129 --> 36:12.130
Cool.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.677
Aztec death whistle.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.471
It's designed to ward off evil spirits.

36:19.555 --> 36:22.057
It's got a really horrifying sound--

36:25.143 --> 36:26.019
What--?

36:28.856 --> 36:30.232
What the hell is that?

36:30.315 --> 36:33.819
-Aztec death whistle. Can I keep it?
-Yes. Just don't do that again.

36:37.072 --> 36:37.906
Hi.

36:38.615 --> 36:39.825
Hello again.

36:41.410 --> 36:43.412
You brought them home.

36:44.621 --> 36:46.206
It's a service I provide.

36:47.082 --> 36:48.834
Well, I'm also an escort.

36:49.793 --> 36:51.211
-That came out wrong.
-Yep.

36:52.004 --> 36:56.216
The truth is, I've always wondered
what lurked inside this haunt box.

36:56.717 --> 37:00.971
Right. Well, the only thing lurking
inside here is my slowly dying soul.

37:01.054 --> 37:02.639
Is that what that smell is?

37:03.223 --> 37:04.892
Well, it's not dinner, so...

37:06.018 --> 37:06.852
All right.

37:09.688 --> 37:11.064
-Would you...
-Sure.

37:12.316 --> 37:13.609
-...like...?
-Yeah.

37:14.193 --> 37:15.777
I don't have any food.

37:15.861 --> 37:17.029
-It's fine.
-Tour.

37:17.112 --> 37:17.988
-Great.
-Great.

37:19.823 --> 37:20.991
Here's the dining room.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.915
I think Grooberson's trying
to bone your mom.

37:33.378 --> 37:34.838
That doesn't bother you?

37:35.339 --> 37:37.132
No, of course it bothers me.

37:37.216 --> 37:40.177
I just don't exhibit emotions
the same way everyone else does.

37:40.761 --> 37:42.554
Inside, I'm vomiting.

37:47.643 --> 37:48.477
Wait.

37:49.895 --> 37:51.522
Isn't this what we saw earlier?

37:57.528 --> 38:00.948
"The Sumerians believed
in a land of the dead,

38:01.031 --> 38:04.701
a dark and shadowy realm
within the bowels of the earth.

38:06.411 --> 38:11.041
The souls of the dead are ruled
by a mighty god, Gozer,

38:11.124 --> 38:13.794
and protected by a powerful Gatekeeper

38:14.628 --> 38:15.921
and Keymaster,

38:16.004 --> 38:19.800
in order that Gozer might rise up
and walk the human plane again.

38:20.425 --> 38:24.346
The Gatekeeper and Keymaster
must assume the form of beasts."

38:27.516 --> 38:28.725
What did we let out?

38:34.481 --> 38:37.192
-Has this ever been cleaned before?
-Not by me.

38:37.776 --> 38:39.069
We're heading up the mountain.

38:41.697 --> 38:42.698
You coming?

39:23.864 --> 39:25.991
Rivers are like the moms of canyons.

39:27.659 --> 39:29.203
When you think about it.

39:50.182 --> 39:51.725
Why'd you bring me here?

39:54.102 --> 39:55.312
Entertainment value.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.064
Can you juggle?

40:01.944 --> 40:03.028
It's not funny.

40:03.111 --> 40:05.989
What are you doing here
in Summerville anyway?

40:08.575 --> 40:11.828
Honestly, my mom won't say it,
but we're broke.

40:11.912 --> 40:14.373
We got evicted,
and the only thing that's left in our name

40:14.456 --> 40:16.667
is this creepy, old farmhouse
our grandfather left us

40:16.750 --> 40:17.918
in the middle of nowhere.

40:19.044 --> 40:19.878
No offense.

40:21.129 --> 40:22.256
I'm not offended.

40:23.215 --> 40:24.842
This place is a dump.

40:27.427 --> 40:28.762
Why do you live here?

40:28.846 --> 40:31.348
I'm fourth-generation dump, so...

40:35.561 --> 40:36.979
Think you'll ever leave?

40:39.523 --> 40:42.526
I mean, if I don't,
what does that say about me?

40:43.402 --> 40:44.653
You don't have a car.

40:46.989 --> 40:48.657
What the hell? Get out.

40:54.413 --> 40:55.455
What is that?

40:56.498 --> 40:57.416
I don't know.

40:57.499 --> 41:02.045
Gozer.

41:11.221 --> 41:12.222
What was that?

41:19.688 --> 41:20.814
It's not funny.

41:23.192 --> 41:24.193
What is this?

41:25.319 --> 41:26.445
That's a map.

41:26.528 --> 41:29.281
Yeah, I know it's a map.

41:29.364 --> 41:34.203
But this thing's ancient.
It's written in some kind of cuneiform.

41:34.286 --> 41:35.537
Oh, yeah?

41:36.580 --> 41:37.789
This is Summerville.

41:38.498 --> 41:40.709
-That doesn't make sense.
-No, not at all.

41:40.792 --> 41:42.586
Summerville's not even 100 years old,

41:42.669 --> 41:45.172
but this thing's written in a language
from thousands of years ago.

41:45.255 --> 41:47.758
For all I know,
that's the language he spoke.

41:48.800 --> 41:49.635
That's it?

41:50.802 --> 41:54.473
You don't think this is incredible
and bizarre and fascinating?

41:56.850 --> 41:57.851
Can I have this?

41:57.935 --> 41:59.561
Yeah, sure. Weirdo.

41:59.645 --> 42:03.649
That's how it starts. First there's a map.
Then you move into a haunted house.

42:03.732 --> 42:05.651
Then everyone's calling you
the Dirt Farmer.

42:07.236 --> 42:09.238
What about Phoebe?
Think she'd want any of this?

42:09.321 --> 42:11.740
Oh, I'm sure Phoebe will find something.

43:02.165 --> 43:03.083
Hello?

44:59.658 --> 45:01.827
Two of the CRT emitters are missing.

45:09.293 --> 45:10.127
Thanks.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.605
How on earth did you build
such a small cyclotron?

45:31.899 --> 45:33.984
Got it. You're a genius.

45:38.530 --> 45:39.948
Needle-nose pliers?

45:49.166 --> 45:52.044
Are you troubled by strange noises
in the middle of the night?

45:52.127 --> 45:54.922
Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?

45:55.547 --> 45:58.509
Have you or any of your family
ever seen a spook, specter, or ghost?

45:58.592 --> 46:00.844
If the answer is yes,
then don't wait another minute.

46:00.928 --> 46:02.930
Pick up your phone
and call the professionals.

46:03.013 --> 46:04.139
Ghostbusters.

46:04.223 --> 46:06.934
Our courteous and efficient staff
is on call 24 hours a day

46:07.017 --> 46:09.186
to serve
all your supernatural elimination needs.

46:09.269 --> 46:11.021
We're ready to believe you.

46:11.104 --> 46:12.523
Hey, you're awake.

46:13.148 --> 46:14.149
What are you up to?

46:15.317 --> 46:16.610
Experiments.

46:16.693 --> 46:17.569
Lame.

46:18.862 --> 46:21.073
Oh, you found popcorn.

46:22.741 --> 46:24.535
What kind of scientist was Grandpa?

46:24.618 --> 46:26.578
The kind that repels loved ones.

46:28.121 --> 46:29.331
Maybe a physicist?

46:29.414 --> 46:30.290
Sure.

46:30.958 --> 46:34.670
So tomorrow I was thinking
of grabbing dinner with Gary.

46:36.338 --> 46:37.214
Who's Gary?

46:37.297 --> 46:38.966
Mr. Grooberson.

46:39.925 --> 46:41.927
His name is Gary Grooberson?

46:42.886 --> 46:46.265
-You have a date with Gary Grooberson.
-It's just dinner.

46:46.348 --> 46:47.808
Good night, Phoebe.

46:49.560 --> 46:50.811
Don't be yourself.

47:19.006 --> 47:20.257
Welcome to Rust City.

47:20.966 --> 47:23.302
This is where they processed
all the raw selenium?

47:23.760 --> 47:24.928
Yeah, I guess.

47:31.310 --> 47:32.311
Cool.

47:33.770 --> 47:37.357
How'd you know how to fix it?
I mean, no offense, but you are 12.

47:37.441 --> 47:39.818
I kind of met my grandfather last night.

47:40.652 --> 47:41.862
He showed me what to do.

47:42.863 --> 47:46.158
No way. Was he, like, howling
and clanking chains?

47:46.241 --> 47:48.202
No. That would've been weird.

47:49.286 --> 47:50.495
Switch me on.

48:39.711 --> 48:40.838
Safety's off.

48:43.006 --> 48:46.218
Her feet are planted.
Her face is poised.

48:46.301 --> 48:48.220
Will this be the moment of her death?

48:48.303 --> 48:50.222
Nobody knows.

48:57.771 --> 48:58.981
Yeah!

49:06.488 --> 49:08.907
Oh, my gosh.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.326
That is the best thing
I've ever seen.

49:17.791 --> 49:18.792
Did I hit it?

49:20.836 --> 49:23.255
You didn't hit it. You destroyed it!

49:23.797 --> 49:25.632
It doesn't even exist anymore!

49:26.466 --> 49:27.509
My turn.

49:33.015 --> 49:33.849
What was that?

49:34.892 --> 49:37.352
Probably a pigeon or something.
Give me the gun.

49:41.190 --> 49:42.691
What is that?

49:44.818 --> 49:45.652
Come on.

49:48.030 --> 49:48.906
Hold on.

49:51.283 --> 49:52.367
You coming?

49:52.451 --> 49:53.410
I'm coming.

50:17.267 --> 50:19.561
I gotta come back here
for my Halloween episode.

51:15.284 --> 51:16.535
It's a ghost.

51:18.245 --> 51:20.664
Aren't you just a little bit freaked out?

51:21.456 --> 51:23.834
Overstimulation calms me.

51:49.818 --> 51:52.946
-Okay, okay, okay.
-What's that for?

51:53.030 --> 51:54.072
I have a plan.

51:54.531 --> 51:55.365
Wait!

52:20.974 --> 52:22.518
-Get the trap!
-Okay.

52:36.114 --> 52:37.074
I got him!

52:38.033 --> 52:39.284
Quick!

52:40.661 --> 52:43.163
-Nuggets!
-Catch him!

53:09.273 --> 53:10.274
Okay.

53:14.486 --> 53:15.529
Come on!

53:19.575 --> 53:20.868
Come on, you can do this.

53:25.455 --> 53:26.665
Come on, darling.

53:33.463 --> 53:34.381
Yes!

53:47.686 --> 53:48.729
Yes!

54:08.290 --> 54:09.124
Shit!

54:26.225 --> 54:27.059
Hey.

54:29.228 --> 54:30.062
Hey.

54:31.313 --> 54:32.606
This is Podcast.

54:33.524 --> 54:35.025
He's my friend.

54:35.108 --> 54:36.109
You have a friend?

54:36.193 --> 54:37.319
You have a car?

54:38.070 --> 54:39.404
Yeah, it's a Cadillac.

54:39.488 --> 54:42.574
Hey, dude. We need a ride.
Do you know how to drive?

54:42.658 --> 54:45.244
He doesn't.
He failed his driver's test three times.

54:46.370 --> 54:47.204
Get in the back.

54:52.584 --> 54:53.544
Thank you.

54:53.627 --> 54:57.381
It sounds crazy, but Oklahoma never
had earthquakes. For centuries.

54:57.464 --> 55:00.926
But then, between 2010 and 2016,
they had like a thousand.

55:01.009 --> 55:02.219
Oh, jeez, what happened?

55:02.302 --> 55:04.763
Oil and gas, that's what happened.

55:04.847 --> 55:08.392
Yeah, they started pumping
millions of gallons of salinated water

55:08.475 --> 55:10.352
deep into the Arbuckle Formation.

55:10.435 --> 55:12.187
And then the porous limestone...

55:15.065 --> 55:17.150
Are you drunk?
Or are you just really bored?

55:17.234 --> 55:19.319
Because I think
I can see you falling asleep.

55:19.945 --> 55:22.447
I just have an allergy to science.

55:22.990 --> 55:24.157
Have you tried Benadryl?

55:24.783 --> 55:25.993
I've tried whiskey.

55:26.076 --> 55:27.369
It's better than Benadryl.

55:27.452 --> 55:30.455
But science is amazing. Science is pure.

55:30.539 --> 55:32.541
It's an absolute.

55:32.624 --> 55:34.751
I mean, it's an answer to all the madness.

55:35.919 --> 55:40.674
Why don't you like science?
Was Phoebe's dad a scientist, or...?

55:40.757 --> 55:42.885
-Oh, gross. No.
-No?

55:42.968 --> 55:44.636
I'm making an assumption.

55:46.597 --> 55:47.890
What's his deal?

55:48.640 --> 55:50.517
Honestly, it doesn't matter.

55:50.601 --> 55:54.146
He was fine with Trevor,
but with Phoebe, he just really--

55:54.229 --> 55:56.315
He couldn't connect with her, so...

55:56.398 --> 55:59.651
Right. Well, he sounds
like a royal dirtbag.

55:59.735 --> 56:01.904
Oh, no, he was actually
just a very ordinary dirtbag.

56:01.987 --> 56:05.866
Well, hey, at least,
Phoebe turned out okay, right?

56:06.533 --> 56:07.534
I hope so.

56:08.243 --> 56:09.077
I don't know.

56:09.661 --> 56:11.788
She really keeps me on the outside.

56:12.414 --> 56:15.334
She's just an awkward, nerdy kid,
but she's awesome.

56:16.126 --> 56:17.336
I think she's great.

56:18.170 --> 56:20.422
I think you're great. You're a great mom.

56:20.506 --> 56:22.216
Yeah. You showed up. You win.

56:23.425 --> 56:26.094
I just wish she'd relax, you know?
Just get into some trouble.

56:26.178 --> 56:27.763
There's plenty of time for that.

56:28.472 --> 56:30.098
Maybe she'll take up pole dancing.

56:30.182 --> 56:33.185
-She's not very coordinated.
-Oh, I don't think that matters.

56:39.983 --> 56:41.818
So, what the hell is going on?

56:41.902 --> 56:43.695
In the 1980's, New York City was attacked.

56:43.779 --> 56:47.616
-I know the Manhattan ghost stories.
-The stories are real.

56:47.699 --> 56:50.410
And so were the guys who climbed
a building and saved the world

56:50.494 --> 56:52.913
and fought back
an invading army of the undead.

56:52.996 --> 56:55.374
Not to mention
a 100-foot marshmallow man.

56:59.127 --> 57:01.129
Our grandfather was Egon Spengler.

57:01.880 --> 57:02.965
He was a Ghostbuster.

57:03.048 --> 57:06.176
All units, we're getting reports of, well,

57:06.260 --> 57:09.972
some kind of animal taking
a bite out of Steve Fletcher's truck.

57:10.055 --> 57:12.474
Apparently, he almost took
the whole tailgate off?

57:12.558 --> 57:14.142
-Muncher.
-Muncher.

57:36.540 --> 57:39.293
-So, what should I be looking for?
-Evidence.

57:54.933 --> 57:56.643
Can you stop breathing in my ear?

57:56.727 --> 57:57.603
No.

57:58.312 --> 57:59.855
You guys, this is kind of stupid.

57:59.938 --> 58:02.524
Are you sure
you didn't see, like, a raccoon

58:02.608 --> 58:05.110
or, like, a possum?

58:05.194 --> 58:06.153
There!

58:10.657 --> 58:11.491
Is that a--?

58:12.159 --> 58:14.953
Free-floating metal muncher.
Definitely Class Five.

58:15.037 --> 58:17.122
Okay, what do we do?

58:17.206 --> 58:18.332
Let's get him.

58:19.082 --> 58:19.917
What?

58:20.542 --> 58:21.835
Let me get a photo first.

58:25.297 --> 58:26.340
Guys?

58:29.885 --> 58:31.386
It has a gunner seat?

58:42.981 --> 58:44.399
Go, go, go!

59:22.938 --> 59:23.772
What the--?

59:39.746 --> 59:42.249
-Yes!
-Trap him!

59:57.723 --> 59:59.975
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

01:00:09.026 --> 01:00:10.194
Come on, keep it straight.

01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:11.945
You try driving this thing.

01:00:15.574 --> 01:00:16.533
Left, left, left!

01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:35.385
Ready!

01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:36.637
Trap him already!

01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:38.764
-Three, two--
-Three, two--

01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:39.890
One.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.121
Oh, my God, what just happened?

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:06.959
He's heading for the mountain.

01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:22.432
-Closer.
-Okay.

01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:23.600
I'm in range.

01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:55.591
She got him!

01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:09.438
Whatever we're doing,
we have to do it now.

01:02:10.898 --> 01:02:12.482
Come on!

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:26.038
-Yes!
-Yeah!

01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.497
Bridge!

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:55.901
-What was that?
-I think we just caught a ghost.

01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:03.283
Sorry.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.495
I was here last night.

01:03:19.091 --> 01:03:20.759
Does any of this bother you?

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.055
-What do you mean?
-Dude, your grandfather was a legend.

01:03:25.138 --> 01:03:27.599
You can literally be anything you want.

01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:30.519
Like a influencer or a DJ.

01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:32.729
It was easier when I thought he went nuts.

01:03:32.813 --> 01:03:35.482
-He didn't go nuts.
-Exactly. So why did he leave Mom?

01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:42.447
Oh, no, no, no.

01:03:42.531 --> 01:03:45.325
-We're screwed. We're so screwed.
-What do we do?

01:03:45.409 --> 01:03:49.162
-I say we fight.
-What? No. Just check the glove box.

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:54.459
License and registration.

01:03:55.711 --> 01:03:57.212
We were on that big mountain,

01:03:57.296 --> 01:04:00.674
and then I went to go hang out
with this girl in this mining cage.

01:04:00.757 --> 01:04:03.468
All of a sudden, it started shaking,
like an earthquake.

01:04:03.552 --> 01:04:07.389
And there were lights,
and then I looked down in this giant hole.

01:04:07.472 --> 01:04:12.895
Inside of it, right in the middle of it,
was either a person or a reptile--

01:04:12.978 --> 01:04:14.771
Are you even paying attention?

01:04:14.855 --> 01:04:17.149
Yeah. I'm just excited we're in jail.

01:04:18.609 --> 01:04:22.863
I thought I heard something say, "Gozer."

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.448
He speaks the truth.

01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:26.533
I was there.

01:04:27.993 --> 01:04:31.455
Hey. Hi. How--? What brings you here?

01:04:31.538 --> 01:04:34.625
Actually, you could help me
with hiding something.

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:37.252
Do you have priors?
'Cause they'll charge you as a minor.

01:04:37.336 --> 01:04:38.712
You'll get two years. Max.

01:04:38.795 --> 01:04:40.464
-Two?
-I'll visit you, okay?

01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:41.381
Lucky.

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:43.675
Quit messing with my inmates.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.802
Sorry, Dad.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.514
"Dad." So you're just...

01:04:49.848 --> 01:04:52.392
Waiting for my ride. Yeah.

01:04:53.185 --> 01:04:55.354
But you look good behind bars.

01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:59.149
Hey. Don't we get a phone call?

01:04:59.816 --> 01:05:00.817
Sure you do.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.696
Who you gonna call?

01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:08.492
Make it quick.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.211
Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?

01:05:22.923 --> 01:05:26.009
Have you or any of your family ever seen
a spook, specter, or ghost?

01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:31.306
If the answer is yes,
then don't wait another minute.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.308
Pick up your phone
and call the professionals.

01:05:52.411 --> 01:05:56.415
-Ray's Occult, and we're closed.
-Wait! I only get one phone call.

01:05:56.999 --> 01:05:57.833
I'm...

01:05:59.209 --> 01:06:00.210
in prison.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:03.714
The slammer, huh? I've been there myself.

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:06.049
I'm not a lawyer, but I'm listening.

01:06:07.718 --> 01:06:09.887
Are you Ray Stantz, the Ghostbuster?

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:12.764
-And now I'm hanging up.
-Hang on. Please.

01:06:14.224 --> 01:06:17.060
I'm calling about Egon Spengler.

01:06:21.899 --> 01:06:23.984
Egon Spengler can rot in hell.

01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.908
He died last week.

01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:37.289
Oh, man.

01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:40.667
No kidding.

01:06:43.837 --> 01:06:47.424
-Weren't you two friends?
-That was a long time ago.

01:06:48.467 --> 01:06:50.177
What happened to you guys?

01:06:52.262 --> 01:06:55.641
Oh, well, look, when we started,
busting ghosts was a gas.

01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:59.019
The economy was good. Reagan years.

01:06:59.811 --> 01:07:04.483
People believed in us.
Then things got slow, hauntings got thin.

01:07:04.566 --> 01:07:07.444
Venkman thought we did our job too well.

01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:10.989
We could barely keep up our mortgage.

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:15.118
Some actor bought up most of Tribeca,
and we lost the firehouse.

01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:16.703
It's a Starbucks now.

01:07:17.913 --> 01:07:22.042
-So then you all just walked away?
-Peter went back to academia.

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:24.670
He's at SUNY Cortland now.
He's a professor emeritus.

01:07:24.753 --> 01:07:27.422
He teaches advertising and promotion.

01:07:27.506 --> 01:07:30.926
Winston went into finance.
He worked hard, coined a fortune and--

01:07:31.009 --> 01:07:32.094
And I'm here.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.932
-Well, what about Egon?
-Well, he wasn't helping.

01:07:37.015 --> 01:07:40.143
We went from ten calls a week
to one if we were lucky.

01:07:40.686 --> 01:07:43.480
Egon started to tell people
that their ghost problems didn't matter

01:07:43.564 --> 01:07:45.232
because the world was coming to an end.

01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:47.276
He got spooky. Freaked me out.

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:50.612
One morning, I go to work
and Ecto-1, our old Cadillac, is gone,

01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:53.699
his neutrona thrower,
collider pack, all the traps,

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:56.243
16 ounces of fuel isotope, all gone!

01:07:56.326 --> 01:07:57.536
He cleaned us out.

01:07:58.495 --> 01:08:00.080
Now we were the dead ones.

01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:04.376
-Don't you think he had a reason?
-He phoned me about ten years later,

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:06.461
some small town in Oklahoma.

01:08:06.545 --> 01:08:10.549
He kept rambling about "the rising storm"
and "the huge psychic tornado"

01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:13.760
that was gonna "consume humanity
in darkness forever."

01:08:14.845 --> 01:08:16.638
And, kid, I wanted to believe.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.805
You don't understand.

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:20.642
There is this mountain
and it has these ancient carvings--

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:23.979
Kid, there are a lot of mountains
with ancient carvings.

01:08:25.147 --> 01:08:26.481
Take a little advice.

01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:28.859
Don't go chasing ghosts.

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:33.572
Egon Spengler was my grandfather.

01:08:34.948 --> 01:08:35.866
Time's up.

01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:38.493
Hey, hello?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.877
-Where are my kids?
-They're in the lockup.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.879
My children are not criminals.

01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:51.715
-Sure they're not.
-Driving without a license.

01:08:51.798 --> 01:08:53.425
Expired registration.

01:08:54.301 --> 01:08:55.135
Speeding.

01:08:55.219 --> 01:08:58.639
-They can't be the first to go joyriding.
-No, they are not.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.517
But they are the first
to destroy half of Main Street

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.310
with whatever that thing is.

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:09.858
-Sorry.
-What were you thinking?

01:09:10.526 --> 01:09:14.404
You know,
you two could have really hurt yourselves.

01:09:16.113 --> 01:09:17.115
Hey. I'm Gary.

01:09:17.823 --> 01:09:19.368
You process them out yet?

01:09:23.956 --> 01:09:25.165
Did you catch anything?

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:26.834
It's inside the trap.

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:28.252
-Right now?
-Yes.

01:09:28.335 --> 01:09:30.754
Let's go. You were supposed
to look after her this summer.

01:09:30.837 --> 01:09:32.631
-I was?
-Not you. Him.

01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:36.176
-This was her idea.
-But what about our stuff? The Ecto-1?

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.345
Everything will remain nice and safe
in our impound locker.

01:09:39.429 --> 01:09:42.265
-No! We need it.
-Phoebe, let's go.

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:44.350
We caught a ghost tonight.

01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:47.187
-Dirt Farmer's family.
-It's true.

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:50.064
And there will be more.

01:09:50.148 --> 01:09:52.818
You're starting to sound
like your lunatic grandfather.

01:09:54.486 --> 01:09:56.947
Phoebe! She didn't mean it.

01:09:57.906 --> 01:09:59.491
You wanna spend the night in my jail?

01:10:04.955 --> 01:10:06.164
You can keep it.

01:10:11.295 --> 01:10:12.921
Go. Now.

01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:18.302
-Trevor.
-I'll see you at work.

01:10:19.219 --> 01:10:20.554
Yeah. See you.

01:10:22.306 --> 01:10:23.140
Hey.

01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:42.993
All right, you guys.

01:10:43.076 --> 01:10:44.453
Remember that--

01:10:44.536 --> 01:10:45.704
Yeah, you got it.

01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:54.421
I'm sorry the night went sideways.

01:10:54.505 --> 01:10:56.924
No. I had a blast.

01:10:57.007 --> 01:10:59.301
Why don't we just pick it up
tomorrow night, same time.

01:10:59.384 --> 01:11:02.012
-You really want more of this?
-Are you kidding me?

01:11:02.095 --> 01:11:05.224
We had kung pao shrimp. We went to jail.

01:11:05.307 --> 01:11:08.685
I don't know how we're gonna top this.
This is a home run.

01:11:13.398 --> 01:11:15.317
My life is a dumpster fire.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.653
I love dumpster fires.
You should see my apartment.

01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:21.823
I don't mean now. Or anytime soon.

01:11:21.907 --> 01:11:24.451
You don't want to-- I'd need to clean--

01:11:25.327 --> 01:11:28.455
This is moving way too fast.
You gotta just relax.

01:11:30.082 --> 01:11:33.752
The kids hungry? They want
some of this unrefrigerated shrimp?

01:11:47.182 --> 01:11:49.726
-We're barely hanging on here.
-You don't understand.

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:53.188
I understand you drove around town,
destroying expensive property.

01:11:55.023 --> 01:11:57.317
Don't you think
your father came out here for a reason?

01:11:57.401 --> 01:11:58.318
No.

01:11:58.986 --> 01:12:04.116
I think he was a sad old man who turned
his back on his family, his partners.

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:07.744
And for what? For a stupid farm
in a town nobody cares about.

01:12:07.828 --> 01:12:10.205
Where, by the way,
everybody thought he was nuts.

01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:12.416
Yeah, great decision, Dad.

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:16.628
He was special. He loved science, like me.

01:12:16.712 --> 01:12:19.339
Why didn't you tell me
my grandfather was Egon Spengler?

01:12:22.426 --> 01:12:26.555
Hey, I'm glad
you found yourself here. I really am.

01:12:28.849 --> 01:12:31.768
But all I see are reminders
that I didn't mean a thing to him.

01:12:32.936 --> 01:12:34.396
He never cared about me.

01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:43.113
He's not nuts.

01:12:43.197 --> 01:12:45.824
Well, then he's an asshole.

01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:48.452
Welcome to the family.

01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:30.160
Yeah.

01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:47.094
Jamoca.

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.179
There we go.

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.057
Strawberry, red velvet...

01:13:53.559 --> 01:13:54.601
Blue velvet?

01:15:16.099 --> 01:15:17.184
Oh, God.

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.180
Hey--

01:17:20.724 --> 01:17:23.685
Okay, so, what exactly is happening
with the map?

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.522
See the concentric circles
around the mountain?

01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:27.731
No.

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:31.735
-Do you see the circles?
-Yes.

01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:34.821
Something's happening
inside that old mine.

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:37.366
Yeah. I know that. It's pretty obvious.

01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:40.410
So I did some digging on the word
you heard in the mountain. "Gozer."

01:17:40.494 --> 01:17:41.537
You did some digging?

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.790
Gozer was a Sumerian god
who once walked amongst the living.

01:17:44.873 --> 01:17:47.042
A soul-eating,
flame-dripping deity of evil.

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:48.669
And I think it wants back.

01:17:48.752 --> 01:17:49.586
Here?

01:17:50.212 --> 01:17:52.422
I know. I would've picked Orlando.

01:17:52.506 --> 01:17:54.591
What does
the name Ivo Shandor mean to you guys?

01:17:54.675 --> 01:17:57.678
Ivo Shandor? He built this whole town.

01:17:57.761 --> 01:18:01.181
He built the mine, foundry,
the school, library.

01:18:01.265 --> 01:18:03.600
-His name is on everything.
-That's tacky.

01:18:03.684 --> 01:18:07.062
In New York, he created an apartment
building made out of selenium girders,

01:18:07.145 --> 01:18:08.522
mined from right here.

01:18:08.605 --> 01:18:10.941
On that same rooftop is
where our grandfather fought

01:18:11.024 --> 01:18:13.485
to keep a horde of ghosts
from entering our dimension.

01:18:13.569 --> 01:18:16.864
Phoebe, what exactly is happening here?

01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:19.741
I can only think of one way
for us to find out.

01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:35.799
So, what do a cigarette
and hamster have in common?

01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:38.760
What?

01:18:39.344 --> 01:18:42.931
They're both harmless until you stick one
in your mouth and light it on fire.

01:18:45.976 --> 01:18:47.102
The worst time.

01:19:11.585 --> 01:19:12.544
Hey, guys, look.

01:19:38.862 --> 01:19:39.696
Is that her?

01:19:41.365 --> 01:19:42.366
Is that Gozer?

01:19:43.033 --> 01:19:44.743
Gozer isn't he or she.

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:47.287
Pretty woke for 3000 BC.

01:19:48.205 --> 01:19:49.915
Everyone watch their steps.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.668
Another hole?

01:19:56.004 --> 01:19:57.631
I wonder where this one leads to.

01:19:57.714 --> 01:19:59.216
A sacrificial death pit.

01:20:00.384 --> 01:20:03.262
-What were they sacrificing?
-Virgins, probably.

01:20:03.846 --> 01:20:06.306
Tough luck for you, dude. Sorry.

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:09.810
Well, statistically,
most 15-year-olds are virgins.

01:20:11.103 --> 01:20:13.647
Fifteen? You're 15?

01:20:15.065 --> 01:20:16.567
I'll be 16 in February.

01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:18.277
It's June.

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.488
What are those holes in the wall?

01:20:25.534 --> 01:20:26.827
They're vacancies.

01:20:28.412 --> 01:20:30.998
If this is a tomb,
where are all the bodies?

01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:33.292
Found one.

01:20:43.594 --> 01:20:45.762
-What?
-Oh, my God.

01:20:46.305 --> 01:20:47.598
Is he sleeping?

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.808
Dude, he's in a coffin.

01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:54.479
It's Ivo Shandor.
He's been in here for 75 years?

01:20:55.272 --> 01:20:56.481
He looks fantastic.

01:20:56.565 --> 01:20:59.401
You know when you die,
your fingernails keep growing.

01:20:59.484 --> 01:21:01.528
Not true. Your skin just shrinks.

01:21:01.612 --> 01:21:03.739
Something was coming and he knew it.

01:21:06.783 --> 01:21:08.243
I think these are years.

01:21:10.204 --> 01:21:11.496
1883.

01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:14.708
The Krakatoa eruption.

01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:17.503
The most violent volcanic activity
in human history.

01:21:17.586 --> 01:21:19.338
What happened in 1908?

01:21:19.963 --> 01:21:22.424
Probably the Tunguska blast over Siberia.

01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:24.092
1945.

01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:26.637
What didn't happen?

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.139
1984.

01:21:29.973 --> 01:21:31.767
Ghosts attack New York City.

01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:33.435
The Manhattan Crossrip.

01:21:41.401 --> 01:21:44.530
-It's a countdown.
-Like a prophecy?

01:21:44.613 --> 01:21:45.948
Do you guys hear that?

01:21:57.501 --> 01:21:58.710
Yeah, I do.

01:22:05.926 --> 01:22:07.803
I think it's coming from the death pit.

01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:29.116
Phoebe.

01:22:44.673 --> 01:22:45.674
Phoebe!

01:22:51.138 --> 01:22:52.264
The earthquakes.

01:22:55.976 --> 01:22:58.729
-Oh, my gosh!
-Phoebe!

01:22:58.812 --> 01:23:00.981
Phoebe.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.530
Phoebe.

01:23:29.927 --> 01:23:31.637
I think he's alive.

01:23:32.262 --> 01:23:34.681
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:34.765 --> 01:23:36.141
-Are you?
-Yeah.

01:23:40.896 --> 01:23:42.147
Pheebs, what's wrong?

01:23:42.773 --> 01:23:44.233
He was right all along.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.945
-What do you mean?
-Our grandfather.

01:23:48.529 --> 01:23:50.531
He was right here. He built this.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.825
He was standing guard,
even when no one believed him.

01:23:55.994 --> 01:23:57.663
He sacrificed everything.

01:23:58.872 --> 01:23:59.873
His life.

01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:02.209
His friends.

01:24:05.546 --> 01:24:06.547
Us.

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:12.386
Bummer.

01:24:15.055 --> 01:24:15.889
Dude.

01:24:18.559 --> 01:24:19.768
We need to tell Mom.

01:24:20.352 --> 01:24:21.395
Phoebe?

01:24:23.438 --> 01:24:24.314
Pheebs?

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.554
Mom?

01:27:05.934 --> 01:27:06.768
Mom?

01:27:09.396 --> 01:27:12.900
There is no Mom. There is only Zuul.

01:27:18.238 --> 01:27:20.240
Mom, are you okay?

01:27:24.536 --> 01:27:29.374
There is no Mom. There is only Zuul.

01:27:32.711 --> 01:27:33.921
What's happening?

01:27:35.756 --> 01:27:36.673
Mom?

01:27:37.549 --> 01:27:38.759
Is she okay?

01:27:38.842 --> 01:27:39.801
Mom?

01:27:52.356 --> 01:27:54.483
Are you the Keymaster?

01:27:55.359 --> 01:27:57.069
-I don't know.
-Mom!

01:27:57.152 --> 01:27:58.445
-What do I do?
-Mom, stop!

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:01.175
Mom!

01:29:05.262 --> 01:29:07.222
What the hell is going on?

01:29:34.416 --> 01:29:35.501
What is all this?

01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:38.378
This isn't a farm.

01:29:40.881 --> 01:29:42.341
It's a trap.

01:30:12.079 --> 01:30:12.913
What?

01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:14.873
Nothing.

01:30:17.459 --> 01:30:19.586
This is what he's been working on
all those years.

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:21.588
-Building this model?
-The detail is amazing.

01:30:21.672 --> 01:30:24.883
No, he came here to finish
what the original Ghostbusters started.

01:30:24.967 --> 01:30:26.844
-To trap Gozer...
-Out in that dirt field.

01:30:26.927 --> 01:30:29.638
Exactly. These big silos act
as a capacitor.

01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:33.517
-What's a capacitor?
-Would it kill you to read?

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.143
Would it kill you to just tell me?

01:30:35.227 --> 01:30:38.063
Once activated, these towers can hold
a charge for one moment.

01:30:38.146 --> 01:30:40.691
But in that one moment,
they can power hundreds of traps.

01:30:40.774 --> 01:30:43.068
So how do we get Gozer into the field?

01:30:43.151 --> 01:30:46.488
-Gozer's protected by two evil spirits.
-The Keymaster and the Gatekeeper.

01:30:46.572 --> 01:30:49.741
She needs both of them.
No Gatekeeper, no Gozer.

01:30:49.825 --> 01:30:52.661
First these spirits must possess
two human souls.

01:30:52.744 --> 01:30:55.163
-Like Mom.
-So they can unite...

01:30:56.164 --> 01:30:57.082
formally.

01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:02.504
-What are we talking about?
-We're thinking at least third base.

01:31:03.088 --> 01:31:04.047
Go, Mom.

01:31:27.112 --> 01:31:28.614
I like your eyes.

01:31:31.325 --> 01:31:32.451
Thanks.

01:31:54.056 --> 01:31:55.265
They were just here.

01:31:57.935 --> 01:31:58.936
There she is.

01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:07.027
-Got anything?
-No, just more stupid guns.

01:32:09.363 --> 01:32:11.865
A jail inside a jail.

01:32:12.741 --> 01:32:14.368
What are you talking about?

01:32:15.369 --> 01:32:16.912
No, no, no!

01:32:19.206 --> 01:32:22.334
It's an ANSI Class One
electromagnetic deadbolt.

01:32:23.418 --> 01:32:24.628
I believe in you.

01:32:26.213 --> 01:32:27.256
It's unpickable.

01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:42.855
-What are you doing?
-I have a plan.

01:32:44.982 --> 01:32:45.816
Wait!

01:33:09.756 --> 01:33:10.841
Come on. Let's go.

01:33:11.758 --> 01:33:12.801
Okay.

01:33:17.931 --> 01:33:19.349
-Ready?
-I'll be waiting.

01:34:05.854 --> 01:34:06.939
That's my mom.

01:34:26.124 --> 01:34:27.209
What?

01:35:00.617 --> 01:35:01.827
Your Eminence.

01:35:03.078 --> 01:35:05.247
Goddess of Gods.

01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:08.166
I have built this temple for you,

01:35:08.876 --> 01:35:10.711
so that you might return to Earth...

01:35:12.754 --> 01:35:13.839
and together...

01:35:16.175 --> 01:35:17.259
we...

01:35:18.802 --> 01:35:20.262
We can rule the world.

01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:51.376
Excuse me.

01:35:53.962 --> 01:35:55.255
Pardon me.

01:35:56.381 --> 01:35:57.424
Yeah, hi.

01:36:06.475 --> 01:36:09.186
What do you call a fish with no eyes?

01:36:13.065 --> 01:36:13.899
A...

01:36:21.365 --> 01:36:22.407
A whale--

01:36:23.033 --> 01:36:25.077
There's two whales in a bar.
One of them goes:

01:36:29.998 --> 01:36:32.000
And then the other one goes:

01:36:32.084 --> 01:36:33.752
"Go home. You're drunk."

01:36:41.051 --> 01:36:41.969
Okay.

01:36:42.928 --> 01:36:45.764
So a grasshopper walks into a bar...

01:36:46.849 --> 01:36:50.644
and the bartender's like,
"We have a drink named after you."

01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:52.521
Then the grasshopper's like:

01:36:53.522 --> 01:36:56.775
"You have a drink named Steve?"

01:37:00.445 --> 01:37:04.950
Have you come
to offer yourself in sacrifice?

01:37:05.576 --> 01:37:06.410
What?

01:37:07.828 --> 01:37:11.373
Are you prepared to die?

01:37:12.291 --> 01:37:14.042
No, I'm 12.

01:37:17.379 --> 01:37:18.589
Are you?

01:37:29.641 --> 01:37:30.851
Mom!

01:37:52.039 --> 01:37:54.499
-Wait, wait. What's going on?
-Hey!

01:37:54.583 --> 01:37:56.376
-What's happening? Where am I?
-It's okay.

01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.836
-You were possessed.
-Possessed?

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:00.672
-Then you turned into a dog.
-Then you got humpy.

01:38:00.756 --> 01:38:01.715
-Humpy?
-Hold on!

01:38:15.646 --> 01:38:19.358
Oh, Phoebe. Phoebe.
There's this secret basement...

01:38:19.441 --> 01:38:21.818
-We know.
-...with computers and equipment.

01:38:21.902 --> 01:38:23.362
-Isn't that place insane?
-Yes!

01:38:23.445 --> 01:38:26.949
-And it seemed like he had a plan.
-We're aware.

01:38:27.783 --> 01:38:32.663
And there were all these photos of me.
Like he was tracking my entire life.

01:38:32.746 --> 01:38:35.249
-How rewarding.
-Super news. We wanna hear about it.

01:38:35.332 --> 01:38:37.709
Yeah, but we're trying
to save the world right now.

01:38:37.793 --> 01:38:39.503
Cool. I'm in. How can I help?

01:38:40.295 --> 01:38:42.422
-No!
-What the hell was that?

01:38:42.506 --> 01:38:45.050
-That was your boyfriend Gary.
-Boyfriend?

01:38:53.141 --> 01:38:55.352
-Inside that trap is the Gatekeeper.
-Gatekeeper?

01:38:55.435 --> 01:38:57.187
If the Gatekeeper
and the Keymaster reunite--

01:38:57.271 --> 01:38:59.439
-Keymaster?
-One second.

01:39:09.157 --> 01:39:10.242
Phoebe.

01:39:10.325 --> 01:39:12.452
You're-- You're--

01:39:14.329 --> 01:39:15.539
I'm a scientist.

01:39:19.668 --> 01:39:21.170
-We got her!
-Yes!

01:39:21.253 --> 01:39:22.629
This was Grandpa's plan.

01:39:24.339 --> 01:39:25.591
Coming in hot!

01:39:46.862 --> 01:39:48.447
Mom, come on!

01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:49.656
Oh, my God.

01:40:02.711 --> 01:40:04.338
-Get back. Get back.
-Mom.

01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:09.134
-What's up?
-Hey.

01:40:13.805 --> 01:40:14.848
No, no, no.

01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:51.885
Pull the lever.

01:40:51.969 --> 01:40:52.803
Pull--?

01:41:06.275 --> 01:41:07.276
Hey!

01:41:18.704 --> 01:41:20.706
Come on, what are you waiting for?

01:41:20.789 --> 01:41:23.041
I'm waiting for this thing to work!
It's not working!

01:41:39.433 --> 01:41:41.310
-Mom, hit the pedal!
-Pedal?

01:41:58.243 --> 01:41:59.661
Lucky!

01:41:59.745 --> 01:42:01.038
Podcast, what are you doing?

01:42:01.121 --> 01:42:02.664
I've got my own problems!

01:42:52.506 --> 01:42:53.632
Oh, no.

01:42:55.259 --> 01:42:56.260
No.

01:43:01.139 --> 01:43:02.516
Hey, flattop.

01:43:05.769 --> 01:43:07.020
Have you missed us?

01:43:11.441 --> 01:43:12.818
Gozer the Gozerian,

01:43:13.694 --> 01:43:16.446
in the name of the county of Summerville,
state of Oklahoma,

01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:20.325
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
all the members of Ducks Unlimited,

01:43:20.409 --> 01:43:23.036
the Association
for the Advancement of Retired Persons,

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.456
I command you
under the National Invasive Species Act

01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:29.126
to depart this world immediately.

01:43:30.002 --> 01:43:30.836
Bravo.

01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:36.383
I think she remembers us.

01:43:39.636 --> 01:43:40.721
Are you...

01:43:41.555 --> 01:43:43.140
a god?

01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:48.187
-Ray?
-Oh, come on, Ray.

01:43:49.688 --> 01:43:50.856
Yes.

01:43:50.939 --> 01:43:52.482
Yeah, we're all gods.

01:43:53.108 --> 01:43:55.652
Yeah, I mean,
we're all pretty dang special down here.

01:43:55.736 --> 01:43:56.904
On a personal note:

01:43:56.987 --> 01:43:59.615
I thought that we had busted up for good.

01:43:59.698 --> 01:44:01.074
It wasn't working for me.

01:44:01.158 --> 01:44:03.744
My friends didn't think so.
I know yours didn't.

01:44:04.578 --> 01:44:06.788
Okay, playtime's over.
Let's toast this muffin.

01:44:09.875 --> 01:44:11.293
Light them up.

01:44:13.587 --> 01:44:14.963
Man, I love that sound.

01:44:17.257 --> 01:44:18.300
On the count of three.

01:44:18.383 --> 01:44:20.928
Go on "two." One. Two.

01:44:23.764 --> 01:44:26.475
Yeah, nothing stings
like a billion electron volts!

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:37.611
Yes!

01:44:39.238 --> 01:44:40.781
-Do you feel that?
-Yeah.

01:44:45.452 --> 01:44:47.329
She's uncrossing the streams!

01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:53.877
No!

01:44:55.963 --> 01:44:56.964
Are they dead?

01:45:00.634 --> 01:45:03.136
I don't remember
this job being so painful.

01:45:04.179 --> 01:45:06.932
-I do.
-You got a lot of nerve.

01:45:08.892 --> 01:45:11.645
Coming back here, crawling back to me.

01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:15.899
We could've been
the most spectacular power couple.

01:45:15.983 --> 01:45:19.486
You know, my sense of fun
and your personality.

01:45:20.404 --> 01:45:23.407
But, no, you always had
to vanquish and conquer.

01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:25.075
Always had to maim somebody.

01:45:25.158 --> 01:45:28.704
And that's probably
the number one reason why--

01:45:28.787 --> 01:45:30.289
Good try, anyway.

01:45:30.914 --> 01:45:32.541
Now we're finished, babe.

01:45:32.624 --> 01:45:33.709
We're finished.

01:45:42.551 --> 01:45:43.385
No.

01:45:55.856 --> 01:45:57.316
Come on, Phoebe.

01:46:24.051 --> 01:46:24.927
Holy shit.

01:47:08.595 --> 01:47:09.638
We're on!

01:48:11.992 --> 01:48:13.327
I thought you might turn up.

01:48:19.082 --> 01:48:20.083
I'm sorry...

01:48:21.126 --> 01:48:22.711
I didn't believe you.

01:48:24.922 --> 01:48:26.089
I should've called.

01:48:27.257 --> 01:48:28.592
I miss you, my friend.

01:48:34.765 --> 01:48:36.183
Are you okay?

01:48:36.266 --> 01:48:38.185
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Mom.

01:48:38.268 --> 01:48:39.603
I can't breathe.

01:48:39.686 --> 01:48:40.771
Okay.

01:48:42.314 --> 01:48:43.148
Hi there.

01:48:43.982 --> 01:48:45.734
Pete Venkman from the home office.

01:48:45.817 --> 01:48:48.195
-Thanks for pitching in.
-You're welcome.

01:48:48.278 --> 01:48:49.655
I like your style.

01:48:49.738 --> 01:48:50.739
Who's that one?

01:48:51.365 --> 01:48:52.324
Callie.

01:48:54.535 --> 01:48:55.953
Callie Spengler.

01:48:56.036 --> 01:48:56.912
Spengler?

01:48:57.663 --> 01:49:00.123
Weird name. Try to make the best of that.

01:49:00.707 --> 01:49:03.126
All right. We're gonna have cocoa inside.

01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:05.462
And some of us will have rum with it.

01:49:06.713 --> 01:49:07.798
Lucky!

01:49:13.887 --> 01:49:16.223
God. Hey. Hey, man.

01:49:16.306 --> 01:49:19.184
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I-- Yeah.

01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:21.520
My hands hurt from galloping.

01:49:29.278 --> 01:49:30.153
Oh, my God.

01:49:31.196 --> 01:49:32.573
I totally thought I lost you.

01:49:32.656 --> 01:49:34.199
Sorry about that.

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.243
That was weird.

01:49:36.827 --> 01:49:37.661
Yeah.

01:49:38.745 --> 01:49:41.456
-I'm bleeding. Why am I bleeding?
-You headbutted a park bench.

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:43.292
-Oh, right. Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:49:45.836 --> 01:49:47.504
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:49:49.047 --> 01:49:51.341
-Back there, yeah.
-Yeah.

01:49:51.425 --> 01:49:53.135
I mean, before we became dogs

01:49:53.218 --> 01:49:57.055
and opened the gates of hell,
I think that maybe we--

01:49:57.139 --> 01:49:59.308
Yeah. Yeah, I think so too.

01:50:00.684 --> 01:50:03.353
-But then we saved the world, so...
-That's true.

01:50:07.983 --> 01:50:09.443
Are you all right, son?

01:50:10.694 --> 01:50:14.114
You just singlehandedly defeated
a manifestation of Gozer.

01:50:14.198 --> 01:50:15.824
You gotta be on my podcast.

01:50:16.366 --> 01:50:17.743
Sure. What's it called?

01:50:17.826 --> 01:50:19.494
Mystical Tales of the Unknown Universe.

01:50:19.578 --> 01:50:21.538
M.T.U.U., that's you?

01:50:21.622 --> 01:50:22.539
Wait.

01:50:22.623 --> 01:50:23.999
You're my subscriber?!

01:50:24.082 --> 01:50:27.419
Really found its voice
in the 46th episode.

01:50:29.087 --> 01:50:30.506
What did they do to you?

01:50:33.467 --> 01:50:34.468
Don't worry.

01:50:35.802 --> 01:50:38.305
I'll take you home,
get you all cleaned up.

01:50:44.061 --> 01:50:44.895
Go.

01:50:49.566 --> 01:50:50.400
Hey.

01:54:37.211 --> 01:54:38.462
Tell me what this is.

01:54:43.467 --> 01:54:44.510
Lines.

01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:47.304
Two--

01:54:47.888 --> 01:54:49.431
No, three...

01:54:51.141 --> 01:54:52.392
wavy lines.

01:54:56.355 --> 01:54:57.898
-It's amazing.
-You're amazing.

01:54:57.981 --> 01:54:59.608
With your ability to...

01:55:00.692 --> 01:55:02.194
flood my psychic powers.

01:55:02.277 --> 01:55:04.571
I can't believe
you used to shock your students.

01:55:04.655 --> 01:55:07.241
Between us, I only zapped the guys.

01:55:09.284 --> 01:55:12.079
It was flawed science.
I know that now. I admit that.

01:55:12.162 --> 01:55:12.996
Ready?

01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:14.915
Try this one.

01:55:17.835 --> 01:55:18.836
Take a moment.

01:55:23.841 --> 01:55:25.425
It's a five-pointed star.

01:55:26.426 --> 01:55:28.637
-Yes?
-How are you doing that?

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:33.100
Some believe that true love imbues
a subject with the ability--

01:55:34.518 --> 01:55:36.645
-Did you mark the cards?
-No.

01:55:36.728 --> 01:55:37.813
You did, didn't you?

01:55:39.439 --> 01:55:40.274
Yeah.

01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:45.612
It works well.

02:01:52.563 --> 02:01:55.315
-I want you to take this.
-What is it?

02:01:55.941 --> 02:02:01.405
It's a souvenir from the World's Fair
at Flushing Meadow in 1964.

02:02:01.488 --> 02:02:03.198
It's my lucky coin.

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:05.701
I shouldn't take it.
We might not be coming back.

02:02:06.618 --> 02:02:09.788
Take it anyway. I got another one at home.

02:02:16.503 --> 02:02:17.963
Egon was the brains.

02:02:18.630 --> 02:02:19.923
Ray was the heart.

02:02:21.216 --> 02:02:22.718
Peter just kept it cool.

02:02:24.136 --> 02:02:24.970
Who were you?

02:02:25.888 --> 02:02:26.972
The sex appeal.

02:02:30.893 --> 02:02:33.353
You've done very well for yourself.

02:02:33.437 --> 02:02:35.022
A lot of shelf space.

02:02:35.898 --> 02:02:37.524
See, that's the thing.

02:02:38.317 --> 02:02:40.110
I don't do it for me.

02:02:41.111 --> 02:02:42.362
I do it for my kids,

02:02:42.446 --> 02:02:45.866
and I wanna be an example
of what's possible.

02:02:45.949 --> 02:02:49.036
You still covering the rent
at Ray's bookshop?

02:02:50.412 --> 02:02:52.706
Ray's gonna turn a profit
one of these days.

02:02:53.457 --> 02:02:55.417
I remember the day you came in.

02:02:56.418 --> 02:02:58.629
I came in looking for a steady paycheck.

02:02:59.254 --> 02:03:01.006
But busting ghosts with the guys...

02:03:01.715 --> 02:03:03.217
taught me not to be afraid.

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:06.512
That I had the tools and I had the talent.

02:03:07.137 --> 02:03:09.515
I started this business with one employee.

02:03:10.307 --> 02:03:13.519
And I've grown it
into a thriving global enterprise.

02:03:14.478 --> 02:03:16.104
I may be a businessman,

02:03:16.813 --> 02:03:19.942
but I will always be a Ghostbuster.
