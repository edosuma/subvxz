WEBVTT

00:04.740 --> 00:07.959
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sergeant Eugene Corbett.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.561
No one can predict what
war will do to a man.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.827
I didn't mean like that.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.745
I believe she's
tryIng to flirt?

00:15.790 --> 00:18.054
Is that what
you call that.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.058
I date soldiers, not
cowards who don't fight.

00:21.100 --> 00:25.275
What do you do? You
sleep with strangers and
take it out in trade.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.016
We all know Marco's a war
hero waItIng to happen.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.584
Still got his father cooped
up in that internment camp.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.973
They're listening.
You bastards.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.249
They brought in some guy to
question me all night.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.463
Your friends were telling
me about your fianc.

00:38.510 --> 00:40.375
I'm not discussing
James with you.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.393
New girls from who knows where.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.611
Love this war.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.742
You're a bad influence,
I'm late.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.315
Enjoy the fresh air,
Ma. A day like this?

01:00.360 --> 01:02.089
Makes you glad to be alive.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.960
Not all of us are
on furlough.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.443
I heard you sneak in
after midnight again.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.276
Not my fault the ladies
find me irresistible.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.139
I'm starting to worry
about you Gene.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.713
Take it easy, Mom.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.933
Besides, no matter how
I spend my nights,

01:14.980 --> 01:19.280
I spend my mornings walking
my best girl to work.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.944
Now there's a beaut.

01:23.430 --> 01:27.719
Betty - Look at that, another
new batch of workers.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.998
Just go, I'll be right in.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.733
Ladies...

01:37.880 --> 01:42.783
That the thanks I get for
saving you from Fritz?

01:42.840 --> 01:43.875
Gotta run.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.478
See ya, Ma.

01:47.670 --> 01:50.924
That a 1944?

01:50.980 --> 01:53.323
Let's keep the road open,
Miss Witham.

01:56.590 --> 01:58.364
C'mon! Move that buggy!

01:58.420 --> 02:00.115
What do you think
you're doing?

02:00.160 --> 02:02.242
You wouldn't really
deny an Ace gunner

02:02.290 --> 02:06.329
a ride in his dream-car,
would you?

02:06.380 --> 02:09.599
Gladys - I'm only going
as far as the parking lot.

02:09.650 --> 02:15.691
Hello, hi, everybody who's
registering come we'll be
signing up right here.

02:15.740 --> 02:19.824
Somebody's going to be here to
sign you up just in a moment.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.691
There's our floor matron now.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.786
The new girls are here,
Mrs. Corbett.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.968
To be late today, of all days
and not even in uniform.

02:28.010 --> 02:29.181
Don't sweat it.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.186
They're girls from
small town East Coast;

02:31.230 --> 02:34.017
they don't know what
they're missing.

02:34.060 --> 02:34.924
Ladies!

02:34.980 --> 02:36.709
Welcome to Victory Munitions.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.888
There are three good reasons
for you to be here today:

02:39.940 --> 02:42.192
Hitler, Hirohito
and Mussolini.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.708
Working here is the best
chance you'll have

02:44.770 --> 02:47.546
to give them a good swift
kick in the pants.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.114
So line up, let's get
you signed in

02:50.170 --> 02:52.161
so you can build some bombs.

02:52.210 --> 02:54.337
Kate - The city's so
short of workers,

02:54.390 --> 02:57.644
I heard they had to shut down an
entire washing machine factory

02:57.690 --> 02:59.214
in Amherst to move
them here.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.251
Washing machines, huh?

03:01.310 --> 03:05.212
Guess we need all the
help we can get.

03:05.270 --> 03:08.489
Downright sin to be building
bombs on a day like today...

03:08.530 --> 03:10.578
even God rested
one day a week.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.271
Eugene Corbett, I am not
playing hoolq with you.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.799
You know you want to.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.707
Bet you've never let that
car loose on the open road.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.921
I prefer to stay
within city limits.

03:19.980 --> 03:21.629
That's too bad.

03:21.670 --> 03:24.969
Car like that needs the carbon
blown outta her every so often.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.100
Don't mind showing
you how it's done.

03:27.160 --> 03:30.414
I doubt my fianc would like
another man behind the wheel.

03:30.470 --> 03:34.247
See? Now I wanna
drive It even more.

03:34.300 --> 03:38.555
Gene - What are you
doing after work?

03:38.600 --> 03:41.899
That Gladys sure can hook a guy,
even when she's not trying.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.474
All it takes is practice.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.602
Just don't set your
sights too high.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.821
Or too low either.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.355
McRae, cover me a moment?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.129
Yes, Ma'am.

03:59.100 --> 03:59.964
Regina Harrison?

04:00.020 --> 04:01.840
I go by Reggie.

04:01.890 --> 04:08.284
Fraternizing with soldiers
is no excuse for tardiness.

04:08.330 --> 04:09.888
He was fraternizing with me.

04:09.940 --> 04:11.589
I was merely
parking my car.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.596
That's not how it
looked to me.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.949
You old enough to
work the line?

04:15.990 --> 04:17.890
What's it say on
my paperwork?

04:17.950 --> 04:20.032
I'm not asking your paperwork.
I'm asking you.

04:20.080 --> 04:24.346
I'm eighteen. Born
February 12, 1924.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.290
Good with math.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.784
Handy skill to have
around here.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.219
Go on in.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.476
I'm late, Mrs. Corbett.

04:32.530 --> 04:33.918
For which I apologize.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.747
The rest of it _is none
of your busmess.

04:36.790 --> 04:37.779
I am his mother.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.276
Yeah, well, you're not mine.

04:41.320 --> 04:47.839
You've been avoiding me like
the plague for months now.

04:47.890 --> 04:50.541
Is there anything else
you want to say to me?

04:50.590 --> 04:53.058
When I have something to say,
you'll know it.

04:53.110 --> 04:54.896
Right now, the
message is simple;

04:54.940 --> 04:56.669
stay away from my son.

05:01.430 --> 05:07.039
Betty - You folks keep all your
things on this side.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.436
Keep your bags under the
benches. And anything metal too.

05:16.180 --> 05:20.958
This is what you do when
you're in line. Make sure
there's no pins or rings.

05:21.010 --> 05:23.478
We were all tenderfoots
once, gIrls.

05:23.540 --> 05:27.180
Remember that when you're
showing our new coworkers
the ropes.

05:27.230 --> 05:29.050
We ain't that tender,
Mrs. Corbett.

05:29.110 --> 05:31.886
Been working factories since
before this place was built.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.101
Must've been early shifts
before your bed-time.

05:34.150 --> 05:37.449
You're gonna wish you knew half
as much as us new girls.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.546
We can all learn
from each other.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.283
The training you received
before arriving

05:41.340 --> 05:42.546
was with non-explosive
materials.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.852
This will be the real deal.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.424
Clear!

05:46.470 --> 05:48.165
The only thing bigger than
that girl's mouth is the chip

05:48.210 --> 05:49.074
on her shoulder.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.553
Gee, reminds me of a friend.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.877
Carol - Good luck
with your transfer.

06:02.970 --> 06:05.268
What's this? Change
of the old guard?

06:05.320 --> 06:07.663
Transferred to the new
forty-mill line.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.400
So... Mr. Aikins'll need
a new office manager?

06:14.460 --> 06:17.623
I suppose he will.

06:29.470 --> 06:33.429
Betty - Come on girls.
Nice and steady.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.083
Slow down Reggie.
It's not a race.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.998
At training they taught
us faster pouring means
more bombs, to blitz Fritz.

06:41.050 --> 06:45.305
Yeah well pour like that
and your amatol levels will be
all over the map.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.520
Anything else, Your Highness?

06:46.580 --> 06:48.832
The girl hasn't even
been here one hour.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.887
Mr. Aikins, if you need
a new office manager,

06:54.930 --> 06:58.627
I feel the position is
perfectly suited to a
girl of my standing.

06:58.670 --> 07:02.026
Or maybe the position is more
suited to the girl who,

07:02.070 --> 07:04.231
while actually standing,
reorganized the entire
filing system.

07:04.290 --> 07:04.972
I helped!

07:05.030 --> 07:05.928
You licked labels.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.719
The whole system was my idea.

07:07.770 --> 07:11.024
Enough. We've a raft of
new workers to process.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.901
But it will be one of us,
won't it?

07:13.950 --> 07:19.388
I suppose. If I can get
yesterday's purchase orders
sometime this week.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.086
Mr. Aikins, I want that job.

07:24.130 --> 07:27.258
And I have plenty to offer,
if you let me prove it.

07:27.310 --> 07:29.175
That was a one-time
slip between us.

07:29.230 --> 07:31.175
I'm married and,
my Minnie and I...

07:31.230 --> 07:33.539
I didn't mean that
kind of offer.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.094
I'm the best person
for this job.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.015
I've proven I can
work an office,

07:38.060 --> 07:39.664
plus I know the
factory floor.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.449
Who else here can say that?

07:41.500 --> 07:44.583
You'll be considered on
your merits, MISS Burr.

07:53.380 --> 07:57.419
No more fun, girls, here
comes Mein Fuhrer.

07:57.470 --> 07:58.380
[Laughing]

07:58.430 --> 08:01.160
Betty, don't.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.121
What did you call me?

08:03.170 --> 08:07.300
"Mein Fuhrer." It means
"Hitler."

08:07.350 --> 08:09.432
Bets, please let's
just have our coffee...

08:09.480 --> 08:12.222
You got a lousy attitude,
ya know that?

08:12.270 --> 08:14.784
I get the job done
and that scares you.

08:14.840 --> 08:19.960
No, what scares me is
you don't even know how
much you don't know.

08:20.020 --> 08:23.274
You calling me stupid?

08:23.320 --> 08:25.936
You're not cranking out
spin-washers anymore.

08:25.980 --> 08:28.062
Lorna - Miss McRae?

08:36.030 --> 08:37.554
Gladys. Gladys!

08:37.600 --> 08:40.945
There's a call for you in the
office. From overseas!

08:40.990 --> 08:44.209
James. It must be James.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.085
I'm not the one
causmg trouble.

08:47.130 --> 08:49.178
That girl, she's
cocky, reckless...

08:49.220 --> 08:51.734
Have you seen her
make a mistake?

08:51.790 --> 08:54.088
She wants to run
before she can walk.

08:54.140 --> 08:55.437
Someone's gonna get hurt.

08:55.490 --> 08:59.130
Then help her. We have
enough enemies in this war.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.350
But I'm...

09:00.400 --> 09:02.960
You're meant to
be a role-model, Miss McRae!

09:05.630 --> 09:08.588
Hello? Hello? James?!

09:08.630 --> 09:12.009
I have a person-to-person
call for Miss Gladys Witham?

09:12.070 --> 09:13.150
Yes, this is she.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.248
Hold please.

09:15.290 --> 09:16.325
Gladys?

09:16.380 --> 09:19.281
Yes, James, it's me!
Can you hear?

09:19.340 --> 09:22.946
All in one piece,
except my heart.

09:22.990 --> 09:25.550
I miss you too darling.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.249
Have you seen any action yet?

09:27.300 --> 09:31.259
Plenty, backstage at
the Windmill Theatre.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.995
All those naked showgirls...

09:33.050 --> 09:34.824
Sorry, what?

09:34.870 --> 09:37.657
I just hope you're having as
much fun as I am over here.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.965
Hate to see you keeping your
knees together on my account.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.614
Who the heck is this?

09:42.660 --> 09:45.311
Eugene Corbett,
you lowdown lout!

09:45.360 --> 09:46.839
I am at work!

09:46.890 --> 09:50.439
You gotta admit, my British
operator was pretty good.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.139
That was a rotten stunt...

09:53.200 --> 09:56.101
You got me, well and good.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.288
I just keep thinking
about that drive

09:59.330 --> 10:02.117
and the wind in your hair.
the beach.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.288
Now, how 'bout I pick
you up after work?

10:05.340 --> 10:06.773
Not a chance.

10:06.820 --> 10:10.813
And don't even think of pulling
a stunt like this again.

10:12.560 --> 10:16.041
I hope for his sake that
wasn't your fianc.

10:16.090 --> 10:18.251
Sorry, Mr. Aikins.
Crank call.

10:18.310 --> 10:20.301
And who fell for that ruse?

10:20.350 --> 10:21.612
It was Vera, sir.

10:21.660 --> 10:24.743
But one can hardly blame
her she wouldn't know

10:24.790 --> 10:28.260
what a real Trans-Atlantic
call sounds like.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.447
Mr. Aikins, there's a
Detective Prentiss here,

10:30.490 --> 10:32.446
from the RCMP.

10:32.500 --> 10:37.324
He wants to speak with Marco.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.195
Check they're good
and smooth girls.

10:43.250 --> 10:46.413
Don't want a spur
coming our way.

10:52.210 --> 10:55.122
Can you believe Mrs. Corbett
raised a son like Gene?

10:55.170 --> 10:58.697
She should take him behind the
shed and give him the switch.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.651
Boy, I'd pay to see that.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.258
Ahhh!

11:02.310 --> 11:03.527
I cut myself...

11:06.970 --> 11:08.653
Matron!

11:08.710 --> 11:10.484
Stop the line.

11:10.530 --> 11:11.531
She'll need stitches.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.229
No, I'll live.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.838
Ohhh...
gonna faint.

11:14.890 --> 11:16.699
Sit down, head
between your knees.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.795
What did you do?!

11:17.850 --> 11:19.841
Me?! Who said that
casmg IS mine?

11:19.890 --> 11:22.279
You want proof of a mistake?
Here it is.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.548
It was her job to
check for spurs.

11:24.590 --> 11:26.069
Take Miss Witham
to the nurse.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.724
This girl shouldn't
be on the line!

11:27.770 --> 11:30.898
The nurse. Now!

11:30.950 --> 11:33.293
Let this be a lesson
to all of us.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.683
Our focus needs to
be on our work.

11:35.730 --> 11:37.129
It wasn't mine!

11:37.170 --> 11:40.253
Focus on the line,
Miss Harrison.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.256
Back to it, girls.

11:50.970 --> 11:53.268
"You bloody bastards.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.788
You punish a man for
what he thinks?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.183
You're right up there
with the fascists."

11:58.230 --> 12:01.358
"So you wanna know
whose side I'm on?

12:01.410 --> 12:04.197
Well_it sure as
hell ain't yours."

12:04.240 --> 12:06.322
These words...
sound familiar?

12:06.370 --> 12:08.361
That was months ago.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.809
Look they had been grilling
me for five hours,

12:10.860 --> 12:13.465
things got a little ugly.

12:13.510 --> 12:14.898
What?

12:14.950 --> 12:17.293
Two years they've been keeping
my father in that place.

12:17.340 --> 12:19.388
Yes, I understand
he had a hearing.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.204
Yeah.

12:21.260 --> 12:24.297
We're hoping he'll
be out soon.

12:24.350 --> 12:26.773
Oh, your father's
release was denied.

12:30.270 --> 12:31.259
How do you know?

12:31.310 --> 12:36.009
They told me.

12:36.050 --> 12:41.488
You know, he's just a
frail old man, you
trying to kill him?

12:41.540 --> 12:46.716
That's not what it sounds
like from the transcript
of his hearing.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.228
So what?

12:49.290 --> 12:52.760
You here to rub
some salt or what?

12:52.810 --> 12:55.938
You're required to sign in
with the police once a month.

12:55.990 --> 12:59.596
Yeah, it's a real joy going
there after working all day...

12:59.640 --> 13:01.289
You're a week late!

13:05.650 --> 13:07.993
Well...

13:08.040 --> 13:10.258
I've been busy.

13:10.310 --> 13:13.131
You're a dark horse,
Mr. Moretti.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.398
Our country doesn't
bet on those.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.089
"Our" country?

13:17.140 --> 13:22.578
Hey, "our" country
is my country too.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.929
Go ahead, treat me
like the enemy,

13:24.970 --> 13:28.189
you just might get what
you're looking for.

13:29.410 --> 13:31.230
Just sign in once a month,
Mr. Moretti.

13:31.280 --> 13:34.158
I'd rather not have to
come back here again.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.801
Mr. Aikins? I want you to
know I've found the solution

13:39.860 --> 13:41.373
to the new girls'
housing problem.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.468
Great, great. Uh...
what problem?

13:43.510 --> 13:46.855
Oh The Workers Association only
found beds for half of them.

13:46.910 --> 13:51.210
So I got a few girls to
share rooms till we got
it sorted out.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.648
Made a fresh pot.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.385
I know you usually have
your third cup around now.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.658
Vera, can you get me
an injury report?

13:57.700 --> 13:58.689
What happened?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.229
Gladys Witham
lacerated her arm.

14:00.270 --> 14:01.430
Is she okay?

14:01.490 --> 14:03.446
A few stitches and
what's left in there,

14:03.490 --> 14:04.525
will stay in there.

14:04.580 --> 14:05.922
If her father _comes
at me agaIn...

14:05.970 --> 14:07.449
She's in one piece.

14:07.490 --> 14:10.493
The fact is, the new girls
aren't gelling with the old.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.019
Mistakes are being made.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.449
That's the problem with you
women. Too damn emotional.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.458
The issue, sir, is that
Victory Munitions

14:17.500 --> 14:19.889
is bringing on too many
lines... too quickly.

14:19.940 --> 14:23.114
We need to make these
girls a part of the team,

14:23.160 --> 14:25.412
or we'll be having
more accidents.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.290
Glad you could make it.
Injuries and all.

14:30.340 --> 14:34.993
Your mother sure hated having
to let me off work early.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.951
You thirsty?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.252
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.005
Come on, Society Girl.

14:41.050 --> 14:44.269
You gonna let a glass
bottle get in the way
of a nice, cold drink?

14:44.310 --> 14:45.743
'Cause for the record?

14:47.490 --> 14:51.051
It's delicious.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.624
You are a troublemaker.

14:52.670 --> 14:54.444
I just do what
feels right.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.923
We're cogs in the war
machine, you and me.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.108
We deserve a little R & R.
Let our scars heal.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.366
I suppose...

15:01.420 --> 15:03.376
It's just a small cut.

15:03.420 --> 15:07.117
See a soldier can't
over-think things.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.071
That's how they
get picked off.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.556
Gotta act on instinct.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.727
Were you scared over there?

15:14.780 --> 15:18.864
No. Why? Is he?

15:18.910 --> 15:20.218
VVho?

15:20.260 --> 15:24.173
Your guy. Was he scared
when he shipped out?

15:24.220 --> 15:26.825
James was like any normal
man leaving for war.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.657
Of course he was scared.
And so were you.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.673
Excuse me, hi.
Could we get some more drinks?

15:43.720 --> 15:46.063
Mrs. Corbett should've
pulled her off the line

15:46.110 --> 15:47.930
after what she did to Gladys.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.855
Come on, McRae, it was
an accident.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.208
The first of many.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.810
If our matron won't do
something about it, I will.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.509
You got nothing on the girl.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.777
Except I do.

15:56.820 --> 15:59.550
No way she's eighteen.
And I'm gonna prove it.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.998
[Bang]

16:05.610 --> 16:08.078
I'm so sorry.

16:08.140 --> 16:13.009
Check it out. I'll go
rescue her.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.052
Miss Andrews. Keep
drying him like that,

16:15.100 --> 16:18.183
you'll have the
opposite effect.

16:18.230 --> 16:21.791
When you grow up your
whole life not allowed to
talk to boys

16:21.850 --> 16:24.068
there's not much in
that bag of tricks.

16:24.110 --> 16:26.271
You weren't allowed
to talk to boys?

16:26.330 --> 16:28.230
Not unless she_ was
reCIting the Bible.

16:28.290 --> 16:31.020
"Let him kiss me with the
kisses of his mouth!

16:31.070 --> 16:34.153
For your love is
better than wine."

16:34.210 --> 16:38.078
Song of Solomon.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.463
What? I was an altar boy.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.739
Yeah, we skipped
those passages.

16:43.780 --> 16:47.693
Hey, it's never too
late to learn, okay?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.526
Here's what you do.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.049
You wanna show
me you're interested?

16:51.090 --> 16:52.432
Keep eye-contact.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.482
But how do I even know if
the boy is interested?

16:54.530 --> 16:55.838
They're not "boys,"
they're men.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.836
And if a girl's standing
and breathing?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.393
A man's interested.

16:59.450 --> 17:00.792
You're looking down again,
sweetheart.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.489
My eyes are up here.

17:02.540 --> 17:03.620
What else?

17:03.670 --> 17:05.149
Okay, now, don't come
on too strong.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.068
You wanna give him signals
but keep 'em small.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.362
Small signals. Like what?

17:10.420 --> 17:13.150
Laugh at something he says,
touch his arm,

17:13.200 --> 17:14.713
give him a smile.

17:14.770 --> 17:17.762
Let him know he's got a shot.
He'll take it from there.

17:17.810 --> 17:19.505
Try it on me.

17:24.650 --> 17:26.163
Oh no, I can't.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.165
You're kidding me.

17:27.220 --> 17:30.644
Try it on Betty.
Practice on Betty.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.658
You're an idiot.
I'm not a guy.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.873
Would you help a
friend out.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.615
Come on.

17:37.660 --> 17:38.831
Say something funny.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.609
"Something funny."

17:40.660 --> 17:43.538
[Laughs]

17:43.580 --> 17:44.706
Very good.

17:44.750 --> 17:49.278
Okay. Next up?
Playing hard to get.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.890
Well would you
look who it is.

17:57.940 --> 18:00.283
Hi, how're you Jimmy.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.728
Hi, Good to see you.

18:01.770 --> 18:04.113
I thought you said you
were shipping out?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.593
Not yet, tomorrow.

18:06.650 --> 18:09.869
You at you!
Clean up well.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.079
Let's go get some dinner.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.650
That's half our bandages rolled.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.539
Mrs. Witham!

18:29.360 --> 18:30.918
Mrs. Corbett,
what on earth...

18:30.970 --> 18:33.313
Your daughter is
dating my son.

18:33.370 --> 18:34.496
Gladys is an adult.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.326
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

18:36.370 --> 18:38.622
You don't believe that
any more than I do.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.148
What do you expect me
to do about it?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.588
Rein in your daughter.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.153
Why don't you
harness your son?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.723
Your daughter's engaged.

18:45.770 --> 18:48.500
This will come down harder on
her than it will on him...

18:48.560 --> 18:49.948
we both know that.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.249
Disappointing,
isn't it?

18:56.300 --> 18:59.827
Realizing your child isn't
the person you'd hoped
they'd become

18:59.870 --> 19:03.306
and that you have absolutely
no control over it.

19:03.350 --> 19:07.616
I'm a mother, Adele.
Defending my own.

19:07.660 --> 19:10.834
I had hoped to find
the same in you.

19:14.970 --> 19:17.530
Must be a wild ride,
wondering every day

19:17.590 --> 19:18.932
if you'll be blown slq-high.

19:18.980 --> 19:21.619
There's a thrill every
once in awhile.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.764
But nothing compares to riding
the tail of a bomber plane.

19:25.810 --> 19:28.119
What's it like?

19:28.160 --> 19:31.630
You go up every night,
afraid you're gonna die.

19:31.690 --> 19:33.851
You feel the rumble
of the prop,

19:33.910 --> 19:35.901
put your hands on the trigger

19:35.950 --> 19:37.383
and something else kicks in.

19:37.430 --> 19:39.648
There's no better
feeling than you get

19:39.700 --> 19:42.692
than cheating death on
a nightly basis.

19:42.740 --> 19:46.005
That's gonna scar, you know.

19:46.050 --> 19:47.915
Then it'll be my first.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.393
No way.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.919
Everyone has scars.

19:50.970 --> 19:53.052
That's not true.

19:53.100 --> 19:57.799
Well then, everyone
who's ever lived.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.061
Well what scars
do you have?

20:02.110 --> 20:04.840
This one? Got it in
my first bar-fight,

20:04.890 --> 20:06.198
only one I ever lost.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.196
Teeth went right through my lip.

20:08.250 --> 20:12.983
This is before I learned how to
throw a decent punch.

20:13.030 --> 20:15.078
This one here's from
campfire cooking.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.726
But damn, that bacon
was worth it.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.202
This one?

20:20.260 --> 20:23.900
My little brother
knocked me out of a tree.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.177
Some brother.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.517
Some tree.

20:31.310 --> 20:32.436
This here.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.617
Okay that's enough,
thank-you very much!

20:34.660 --> 20:37.356
Oh this one's a beaut.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.275
The big one.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.754
Turret on my Wellington
took a hit.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.233
Glass shattered.

20:43.280 --> 20:48.104
If it was a direct hit, I
wouldn't be standing here.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.633
What are you doing?!

20:54.680 --> 20:56.762
What does it look like?

21:09.310 --> 21:11.471
Go on, Society Girl.

21:11.530 --> 21:16.832
Tell yourself all the reasons
you don't want to join me.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.654
Awww! What the hell.

21:35.850 --> 21:38.114
Felt good, didn't it?

21:38.160 --> 21:40.503
Once I got used to it.

21:43.170 --> 21:45.422
What made you change your mind?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.165
About coming out to play?

21:47.210 --> 21:49.997
Tired of being a good girl?

21:50.040 --> 21:54.079
I told myself it was
to bug your mother.

21:54.130 --> 21:56.269
But the truth is...

21:56.310 --> 21:59.006
You like me.

21:59.050 --> 22:03.919
I like me, when I'm with you.

22:03.970 --> 22:06.359
That's all I know.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.943
Miss Harrison?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.991
Just... washing up
before shift.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.258
VicMu facilities are not
for personal use,

22:35.310 --> 22:37.995
that was all part of
your initiation.

22:38.050 --> 22:39.870
I know. I'm sorry.
Please don't...

22:39.920 --> 22:42.878
Where did you sleep
last night?

22:42.920 --> 22:44.399
Bus station.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.010
What happened to your
housing assignment?

22:47.060 --> 22:48.539
Showed up,

22:48.580 --> 22:52.493
landlady took one look at me
and poof, "lost" my name.

22:52.540 --> 22:57.011
With all the new girls in
town now, they can be choosy.

22:57.070 --> 22:59.061
Surely it was a mistake.

22:59.110 --> 23:01.897
It's okay, been on my own
since I was fourteen.

23:01.940 --> 23:04.989
I'll find something,
I always do.

23:05.030 --> 23:09.160
No girl of mine sleeps
in a bus station.

23:09.210 --> 23:11.110
I'm not your girl,
Mrs. Corbett.

23:11.170 --> 23:14.515
I'll see you have
a place tonight.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.429
The fancy one. Gladys.
She okay?

23:19.480 --> 23:22.916
On the mend, and tougher
than she looks.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.613
[Knocking at the door]

23:31.670 --> 23:35.788
Two minutes!
Then you can clean.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.149
[Knocking at the door]

23:38.190 --> 23:42.889
I said two minutes and
then you can clean.

23:42.940 --> 23:45.408
And me without my dust-mop.

23:45.460 --> 23:48.463
Mother. Slumming at
this early hour?

23:48.510 --> 23:51.115
I'm not but I
understand you are.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.981
What's going on between
you and Eugene Corbett?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.246
Nothing.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.813
And I'm late for work.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.031
So whatever it is
you want to say,

23:59.080 --> 24:00.479
better get to it quickly.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.033
Such a handsome young man.

24:02.090 --> 24:06.129
James is all a girl
could ask for.

24:06.180 --> 24:08.171
You can justify it
all you want,

24:08.220 --> 24:11.439
tell yourself you'll
be discreet.

24:11.490 --> 24:15.358
But once you cross that line,

24:15.410 --> 24:19.050
when James comes back
home to you he'll know.

24:19.100 --> 24:24.879
He'll see it in your face,
feel it in your touch.

24:24.940 --> 24:30.196
And it will cut through
him like shrapnel.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.059
I know what Daddy did to you.

24:32.120 --> 24:36.295
No, you don't.

24:36.340 --> 24:40.071
But keep it up

24:40.130 --> 24:41.995
and you will.

25:08.630 --> 25:10.188
Mine's jammed.

25:13.940 --> 25:16.545
Mr. Aikins.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.898
You want to help the
new girls fit in?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.292
I have the solution.

25:20.340 --> 25:21.682
I'm listening.

25:21.730 --> 25:25.996
What we need is... a mixer.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.122
We've got girls at
each other's throats,

25:28.170 --> 25:31.082
we've been accident-free
exactly zero days...

25:31.130 --> 25:34.179
and you want me to throw
these dizzy hens a party?

25:34.220 --> 25:36.085
Yes, Sir. I worked that line.

25:36.140 --> 25:38.779
And I know if these girls
don't know each other,

25:38.840 --> 25:40.614
they won't like
each another.

25:40.660 --> 25:43.572
And if they don't like
each other, they won't
respect each other.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.406
And if they don't respect
each other,

25:45.450 --> 25:48.578
The Victory Beacon already
scheduled a photograph of
Blue shift.

25:48.630 --> 25:52.100
_So there's no reason the
kitchen can't whip up some
punch and snacks.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.583
She's right.

25:53.630 --> 25:56.190
It's important for the new
girls to feel welcome.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.413
We need to make friends
out of strangers.

25:59.470 --> 26:03.201
Thank you,
Mrs. Corbett.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.593
Just make sure it works.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.129
Gladys.

26:15.180 --> 26:19.879
I've agonized about
telling you but if I don't
I'll positively burst.

26:19.920 --> 26:23.617
You will never guess
whom I saw at the corner
of College and Yonge,

26:23.660 --> 26:25.002
prowling for soldiers.

26:25.060 --> 26:27.221
You're right, Carol.
I'll never guess.

26:27.280 --> 26:31.273
Vera Burr!

26:31.320 --> 26:32.844
So what?

26:32.890 --> 26:35.882
Show me a woman these days who
isn't flirting with soldiers.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.157
"So what"?!

26:37.200 --> 26:39.327
Gladys, you are friends
with a patriotute!

26:39.380 --> 26:41.325
You should have seen
all the gifts;

26:41.380 --> 26:43.245
they're positively bursting
out of her drawers!

26:43.290 --> 26:44.894
I don't see your problem.

26:44.950 --> 26:47.111
Why judge what makes
another person happy?

26:47.170 --> 26:49.900
Alleycats who swill beer
out of the bottles

26:49.950 --> 26:51.645
and sleep with anything
in uniforms

26:51.690 --> 26:56.343
should not be angling to be
our next Office Manager.

26:56.390 --> 26:59.086
You're a snob, Carol Demers.

26:59.130 --> 27:03.009
Well at least I'll be able to
wear white on my wedding day.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.318
So what do you think
of the party room?

27:10.360 --> 27:13.181
Very nice.
Blue shift is on their way in.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.105
...and while you're
far from your families,

27:20.160 --> 27:25.280
I hope you'll consider this
factory your home away
from home.

27:25.330 --> 27:29.289
The factory and your country,
thank you for your service.

27:29.340 --> 27:33.037
And the line's productivity
is up three percent!

27:33.080 --> 27:35.298
So keep up the good work!

27:35.340 --> 27:36.295
Enjoy the mixer.

27:36.350 --> 27:41.959
[Clapping]

27:42.000 --> 27:44.173
Patting us on the back
for productivity

27:44.220 --> 27:46.780
when girls are
getting hurt.

27:46.830 --> 27:50.357
Thank you, Mr. Aikins!
Okay everybody!

27:50.400 --> 27:52.311
Hands behind your back!

27:52.360 --> 27:53.873
Carol, What are you doing?!

27:53.930 --> 27:55.830
It's time to play
"Pass the Orange"

27:55.890 --> 27:57.494
it's a hoot and a half.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.668
So the object of the game
is to pass the orange

28:00.720 --> 28:04.713
between people without
using your hands!

28:04.770 --> 28:07.762
We'll just get a line of two
people here, so...

28:07.810 --> 28:09.630
You here and you...

28:09.680 --> 28:10.465
Psst.

28:13.250 --> 28:17.038
Hey, Ma. Came to
pick you up.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.901
Yeah, I know darn well
who you're here for.

28:19.950 --> 28:22.384
Why do you want to get
involved with her?

28:22.430 --> 28:24.569
You don't think I'm
good enough?

28:24.610 --> 28:27.738
She's a Witham. People like the
Withams use people like us.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.348
You're going to regret this,
Gene.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.004
I'm shipping overseas soon.

28:31.050 --> 28:35.441
The only thing I'm going
to regret is sitting
here on my hands.

28:35.490 --> 28:39.790
Here take an orange,
here you go.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.977
Gladys.

28:41.020 --> 28:41.918
No.

28:46.150 --> 28:48.368
Eating the game I see?

28:48.420 --> 28:51.241
Tastier than horseshoes.

28:51.290 --> 28:54.020
Someone should put that
girl out of her misery

28:54.080 --> 28:56.025
before she hurts herself.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.720
[Laughs]

28:59.780 --> 29:02.647
I hear the punch is delish.
Wanna give it a shot?

29:02.690 --> 29:06.160
Not sure punch is in
the cards for us.

29:06.220 --> 29:09.348
Look, I only went out with
you 'cause Ivan asked me.

29:09.390 --> 29:10.527
Buster!

29:10.570 --> 29:13.789
Hey, least I'm not stringing
her along.

29:13.830 --> 29:17.357
We need something to wash
down those oranges -- c'mon.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.350
It's quite a gas,
I'm telling you.

29:22.540 --> 29:24.929
Hey! Society Girl.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.311
[Whistles]

29:28.240 --> 29:29.935
The whole factory can hear you.

29:29.980 --> 29:30.628
Let's fly.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.419
I don't think I should.

29:34.460 --> 29:35.324
Why not?

29:35.380 --> 29:37.336
It's not a good idea.

29:37.380 --> 29:40.679
Very good girls!
Look how good they are!

29:46.650 --> 29:48.868
I called your
school in Amherst.

29:48.910 --> 29:52.471
You were born in 1925,
makes you seventeen.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.397
So you know
your math too.

29:54.440 --> 29:57.307
You gonna quit, or
do I rat you out?

29:57.360 --> 30:00.352
Come on, they bend rules
here left, right, and centre.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.834
I ain't the only girl
working here underage.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.792
No, but you're the
only girl here
causing accidents.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.923
So if you don't quit,
I'll have you fired.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.931
[Gasps]

30:26.950 --> 30:29.999
Hey hey hey!
Get them apart!

30:32.870 --> 30:35.179
Get them apart!

30:36.180 --> 30:38.523
Is this what you
had in mind

30:38.570 --> 30:40.390
when you said
"mixing"?

30:40.440 --> 30:41.873
Stuff it, Carol.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.569
That's it!
Enough!

30:43.620 --> 30:45.349
I'll meet you
at the corner.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.799
Ten minutes.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.182
If you don't show,

30:48.230 --> 30:50.095
I won't bother
you again.

30:50.150 --> 30:54.234
Nothing to see here.
Let's try another game, OK?

31:00.850 --> 31:01.760
One second...

31:02.730 --> 31:03.890
Time's up, ladies!

31:03.940 --> 31:06.329
German battleship
Bismarck sank what ship

31:06.380 --> 31:09.508
known as the "Pride of
the British Navy"?

31:09.560 --> 31:12.165
Was it the HMS Hood?

31:12.210 --> 31:13.381
Awwww. . ..

31:13.430 --> 31:14.476
Correct!

31:14.520 --> 31:16.954
[Cheers]

31:17.000 --> 31:20.822
[Cheers - muted]

31:20.870 --> 31:22.918
Guess I didn't wreck
the mixer.

31:22.960 --> 31:27.351
Vera saved the day,
some trivia game.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.311
Boys versus girls.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.147
Doesn't sound like
a fair fight.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.498
Neither was this one.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.919
That girl's had a
rough go of it.

31:36.980 --> 31:40.416
Yeah, well
who hasn't?

31:40.460 --> 31:43.418
She's too young,
Mrs. Corbett.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.064
Seventeen.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.419
You know how many boys
lie about their age

31:48.470 --> 31:50.461
to sign up to go
overseas?

31:50.510 --> 31:52.978
You grow up fast
on your own

31:53.040 --> 31:56.203
and she's been on her
own a while now.

31:56.260 --> 31:59.218
How can you be willing
to lie for her?

31:59.260 --> 32:00.477
She's a good worker.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.785
You heard it yourself,
productivity is up.

32:03.830 --> 32:06.469
You never let this
kind of thing slide!

32:06.530 --> 32:08.998
She made a
mistake, Betty.

32:09.050 --> 32:11.518
We start rooting out
every girl who slips up,

32:11.580 --> 32:15.220
we're looking at an
empty factory.

32:15.280 --> 32:18.659
Well, if you don't tell
Mr. Aikins, I will.

32:18.710 --> 32:19.574
Just remember,

32:19.630 --> 32:22.144
sometimes the
harder we fight,

32:22.200 --> 32:24.498
the worse
we make it.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.219
Is this what it's
like up there?

32:47.260 --> 32:48.340
Flying?

32:48.400 --> 32:53.656
No, it's
way faster.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.439
Like this.

33:02.060 --> 33:04.528
VVhoa!

33:04.590 --> 33:06.455
Ladies 8, Men 4.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.799
C'mon guys, the girls
are cleaning your clocks!

33:09.850 --> 33:10.635
Next question.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.545
Buster's just proud.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.468
Still, he shouldn't
have said that.

33:15.510 --> 33:18.115
Seems neither of us
are luclq in love.

33:21.340 --> 33:24.070
I just meant...

33:24.130 --> 33:26.997
I was sorry to hear
about you and Betty.

33:29.740 --> 33:31.048
More punch?

33:31.090 --> 33:33.786
I'd love some.

33:33.830 --> 33:34.649
Here we are.

33:34.700 --> 33:35.826
For the boys...

33:35.880 --> 33:37.097
Well done.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.051
Who was the third Prime
Minister of Canada?

33:43.540 --> 33:44.882
Some right hook you got.

33:44.930 --> 33:46.409
I can fend for myself.

33:46.450 --> 33:47.314
Yeah me too.

33:47.370 --> 33:49.668
Grew up with
four brothers.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.618
You rat me out?

33:50.680 --> 33:54.457
Not yet.

33:54.510 --> 33:56.193
This job?

33:56.250 --> 33:57.979
It's the only thing I got.

33:58.030 --> 33:59.850
Big card boys
don't let us down.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.630
What happened to your friend,
it won't happen again.

34:02.690 --> 34:05.591
You gonna pour
amatol my way?

34:05.650 --> 34:08.289
Not on your life.

34:12.390 --> 34:14.858
See, all we needed was
a common enemy.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.649
Have you seen Gladys?

34:16.700 --> 34:18.748
She left here a while ago.

34:39.330 --> 34:40.729
I got it.

34:41.730 --> 34:42.719
I got it!

34:42.770 --> 34:45.557
Gene, I got it.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.989
I got it. Stop it!

34:48.040 --> 34:48.779
Stop it!

34:48.820 --> 34:49.684
Gene!

34:49.730 --> 34:52.381
Let go!

34:52.430 --> 34:53.510
Gene!

34:53.560 --> 34:55.118
Let go! Stop it!

34:55.180 --> 34:55.862
Gene!

34:55.910 --> 34:58.128
Stop please.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.648
Whooo! !!

35:05.710 --> 35:06.790
That was close!

35:14.980 --> 35:16.231
We almost died.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.158
That's what it feels like.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.849
Your heart beating like that?

35:20.900 --> 35:22.583
Your life right on the edge?

35:22.640 --> 35:24.983
That's what it
feels like to fly.

35:29.770 --> 35:32.773
Hey listen, I'm sorry,

35:32.820 --> 35:35.254
I shouldn't have
done that.

35:59.850 --> 36:02.239
This ones for the boys.

36:02.290 --> 36:05.191
Which factory girl lines
up at College and Yonge

36:05.250 --> 36:07.593
to show soldiers a good time?

36:09.160 --> 36:10.468
Anyone?

36:14.300 --> 36:15.642
Vera?

36:15.690 --> 36:17.646
I may not be a soldier,

36:17.690 --> 36:19.681
but if I give you these,

36:19.740 --> 36:22.607
will you give me twenty
minutes in the storeroom?

36:26.740 --> 36:30.961
Twenty minutes, Donald?

36:31.010 --> 36:34.832
Word is, you've never
gone longer than three.

36:34.880 --> 36:39.658
[Laughing]

36:39.710 --> 36:40.756
Keep them.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.791
They'll look better
on you anyway.

36:42.850 --> 36:52.896
[Laughing]

37:07.130 --> 37:09.951
_ Can I see some
identification please?

37:10.010 --> 37:11.523
Oh dear.

37:16.530 --> 37:19.829
If you were going to
completely ignore my advice,

37:19.880 --> 37:24.271
the least you could do was
keep the police out of it.

37:28.150 --> 37:31.802
What's going to
happen to him?

37:31.850 --> 37:35.638
I imagine he will be charged
with reckless endangerment.

37:41.340 --> 37:43.126
They won't arrest
a war hero.

37:43.170 --> 37:46.901
What on earth were
you thinking!?

37:46.960 --> 37:49.645
'Cause when these wonderful
feelings pass,

37:49.700 --> 37:51.952
you'll have nothing
but a few tawdry memories

37:52.000 --> 37:54.787
and your name in the mud.

37:54.830 --> 38:00.314
I don't care what people think.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.874
I don't want your life, Mother.

38:02.930 --> 38:07.572
I won't suffer silently for the
sake of appearances.

38:07.630 --> 38:10.667
Keeping this from the press,

38:10.720 --> 38:14.065
and your father,

38:14.110 --> 38:19.116
is the last act of kindness
I do for you.

38:19.160 --> 38:22.027
From now on, you're on your own.

38:28.820 --> 38:35.953
[Crying]

38:36.000 --> 38:38.616
Donald's an idiot.
Don't pay him any mind.

38:40.880 --> 38:45.135
Those gifts,

38:45.190 --> 38:50.492
they're like love-letters.

38:50.540 --> 38:53.100
They help me remember those
nights when somebody

38:53.150 --> 38:55.618
made me feel beautiful.

39:19.660 --> 39:22.743
I'm not ashamed
of any of it.

39:25.970 --> 39:28.131
Then why are you crying?

39:38.370 --> 39:41.589
Something that I didn't mean
to happen... happened.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.064
With Ivan.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.281
Somehow I...

39:47.340 --> 39:48.466
flirted with him.

39:48.510 --> 39:51.593
Then he went and asked
me to go out with him.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.210
But I won't. Not if you
don't want me to.

39:54.260 --> 39:56.205
He's a nice guy.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.991
You could do a lot worse.

40:00.040 --> 40:02.088
You sure it's okay?

40:02.130 --> 40:04.439
Mmmmmmm.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.038
Okay then.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.652
Help me pick a new dress?

40:24.590 --> 40:25.932
By my reckoning,

40:25.980 --> 40:28.028
you rank you the best
person for Office Manager.

40:28.070 --> 40:30.243
Thank you.

40:30.290 --> 40:31.723
Glad you can see that.

40:31.770 --> 40:35.376
But I can't give
you the job.

40:35.430 --> 40:36.556
Not now.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.773
Not after the mixer.

40:40.040 --> 40:43.032
I deserve that job.

40:43.090 --> 40:44.250
I earned it.

40:44.310 --> 40:46.471
I know you did.

40:46.530 --> 40:51.263
But I can't promote a girl
with your... reputation.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.750
I_never meant for
it to go that far.

41:07.810 --> 41:11.246
Yeah. Where did you
think it would go?

41:21.430 --> 41:22.294
Carol.

41:24.130 --> 41:25.085
Yes sir?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.468
Place a help-wanted
ad in The Star.

41:29.530 --> 41:33.489
I'll be hiring from
outside the factory.

41:48.150 --> 41:50.141
Hi, Beautiful.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.417
Packing it in?

41:51.460 --> 41:54.156
Yeah. Heading downtown?

41:54.200 --> 41:55.508
What's is to you?

41:55.550 --> 41:58.337
Thought I'd buy you an
ice-cream at Fran's.

41:58.380 --> 41:59.984
Hang on a second.

42:00.030 --> 42:02.078
There's that cop again.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.166
Hey!

42:04.340 --> 42:05.773
Mister Moretti.

42:05.820 --> 42:08.732
Yeah so, I went to the station,
reported to my officer.

42:08.780 --> 42:10.645
Said he wasn't the
least bit worried.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.656
So why all the fuss?

42:12.700 --> 42:15.089
The fuss is that you
have security clearance

42:15.140 --> 42:16.266
to work at this plant.

42:16.310 --> 42:18.619
You wanna keep it,
follow the rules.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.743
I follow the rules every
damn one you throw at me!

42:21.800 --> 42:23.097
Marco, come on...

42:23.140 --> 42:26.018
Tell your boyfriend
to behave himself.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.238
I asked about this guy
down at the station.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.009
They never even heard of him.

42:33.070 --> 42:35.152
There's rumbling about a
new project coming

42:35.200 --> 42:37.020
to the factory
means more security.

42:37.070 --> 42:39.061
Maybe that's it.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.849
Yeah.

42:40.900 --> 42:41.503
Maybe.

42:41.550 --> 42:44.201
Hey!

42:44.250 --> 42:46.468
You promised me
an ice-cream.

42:48.080 --> 42:48.774
C'mon.

42:49.870 --> 42:51.383
Now that you're staying here.

42:51.430 --> 42:54.035
I'll make sure that
you eat well.

42:54.090 --> 42:57.526
Can't remember the last time
someone cooked for me.

42:57.570 --> 43:00.824
It's much nicer cooking for two,
don't you think?

43:10.320 --> 43:11.662
Mrs. Corbett?

43:11.710 --> 43:14.190
_ _There's a man
Sitting on your fence.

43:18.460 --> 43:22.248
I said bank left!
[Making gun noises]

43:22.290 --> 43:24.758
We got a Jerry coming in hard...
[Making gun noises]

43:24.810 --> 43:26.243
make some music...
[Making gun n0ises]

43:26.290 --> 43:31.034
[Making gun noises]

43:31.080 --> 43:36.120
Yeah, that's it...
