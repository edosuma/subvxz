I m gonna buy this camp.

01:27.959 --> 01:29.500
So have you thought any more
about next summer?

01:29.500 --> 01:31.875
- Only constantly.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.542
Still haven t made
a decision yet, though.

01:33.542 --> 01:36.750
- Well, here s something
to help.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.083

01:39.083 --> 01:40.500
- Not yet, Simone.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.500
- We ve got a situation
down at the equipment shed,

01:42.500 --> 01:44.667
and I could really use
a big, strong man.

01:44.667 --> 01:47.375

- That s right.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.041
Well, how do you like it?

02:23.041 --> 02:24.375
- I love it.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.083
In fact,
one of my professors said

02:26.083 --> 02:28.125
he could get me an internship
at a firm next summer.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.291
- So you won t be back?

02:29.291 --> 02:30.917

02:30.917 --> 02:32.625
I really wish I could do both.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.083

what Cody wants you to do.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.041
- Yeah, well, you know Cody.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.125
He doesn t want anything
to do with that whole rat race

02:38.125 --> 02:39.583
and doesn t understand
why I do.

02:39.583 --> 02:42.458

for you to come back.

with you around.

Besides,
Vanessa is not really--

06:07.166 --> 06:08.542

06:08.542 --> 06:11.625
But I think Allison
would listen.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.375

in the building.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.709
- Did he, now?

06:25.709 --> 06:27.291
- But I told him
to correct his order,

06:27.291 --> 06:29.458
because these are for the most
beautiful woman in the city.

06:29.458 --> 06:32.333
- Such a smooth talker.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.792
No wonder you re in charge
of bringing in new clients.

06:35.792 --> 06:38.959
"Congratulations
on the new account."

06:38.959 --> 06:41.125
- It s your second one
this month.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.500
You re on your way.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.458
- No, I know.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.834
It s just, wouldn t it be nice

06:49.834 --> 06:52.834
to do something
meaningful for a change?

06:52.834 --> 06:55.333
- No, what would be nice is if
Nathan made you the lead on one

06:55.333 --> 06:57.500
like he should have done
a long time ago.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.834
Imagine you and me side by side.

06:59.834 --> 07:02.500
I bring in the clients,
and you knock them out.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.917
But all I m thinking about
right now

07:04.917 --> 07:07.417
is you and me on our
company retreat next week.

07:07.417 --> 07:08.875
- It s just a business trip.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.875
- Yeah, the days will be work,

07:10.875 --> 07:12.792
but we ll have some time
for ourselves.

07:12.792 --> 07:18.542
Romantic dinners,
sunset walks on the beach.

07:18.542 --> 07:20.250
- Sounds nice.

07:20.250 --> 07:23.291
- Okay, break this up,
whatever this is.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.583
Nathan needs to see everyone
in the conference area.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.208
- Yup.

07:30.375 --> 07:31.542
- Okay.

07:31.542 --> 07:33.041
I ll just make this quick.

07:33.041 --> 07:36.458
We are all aware of what s
happening next week, right?

07:36.458 --> 07:39.166
- Yes.
- The annual offsite retreat.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.834
Okay, we love it, we love it.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.417
It s a lot of fun in the sun,

07:42.417 --> 07:44.834
you know, spa sessions,
gourmet food,

07:44.834 --> 07:47.208
that kind of thing,
all on the company dime.

07:47.208 --> 07:52.458
However, there s one small
adjustment this year.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.500
You see, the whole point
of the retreat

07:55.500 --> 07:58.709
is to promote
office camaraderie,

07:58.709 --> 08:00.250
a little teamwork.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.959
And I started thinking,
how is that possible

08:02.959 --> 08:06.250
if we are all off
doing our own activities,

08:06.250 --> 08:08.417
our own thing,
and we re not working together?

08:08.417 --> 08:10.875
So I found another option.

08:10.875 --> 08:14.750
We will not be going to the
Vanderfield Resort this year.

08:14.750 --> 08:15.917
I m sorry.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.000
I know you like it there,
but listen to me.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.375
Instead, we re going
to an adventure camp

08:22.375 --> 08:24.083
up in the Catskills.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.583
- Uh, what is this--
- I m sorry, Bryce?

08:25.583 --> 08:26.583
What was that?

08:26.583 --> 08:27.709
- It s a great idea, sir.

08:27.709 --> 08:29.208
- Okay, good,
glad you re on board.

08:29.208 --> 08:33.125
Anyway, go home, get some rest,
and pack for some fun.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.125
Have fun, guys.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.457

with all those sundresses?

08:42.332 --> 08:45.917

for themselves.

actions can be misinterpreted,

19:01.709 --> 19:03.000

a chance to explain.

- Or people could explain
at the time.

got tongue-tied.

51:43.333 --> 51:44.792
I m kidnapping her.
I m sorry, guys.

51:44.792 --> 51:46.667
- We ve got it covered.
- We got it.

51:46.667 --> 51:48.041
Come on.

51:48.041 --> 51:50.041
- We are going over this
one more time when I get back.

51:50.041 --> 51:50.959
- Of course.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.542
- Close your eyes.

51:55.542 --> 51:56.667
- Cody, maybe we should go back.

51:56.667 --> 52:00.250
- No, just close your eyes.

52:00.250 --> 52:02.208
Ever since you arrived,

52:02.208 --> 52:04.542
there s been one thing
on my mind.

52:04.542 --> 52:06.000
We started something
a long time ago

52:06.000 --> 52:07.500
that we never got to finish.

52:07.500 --> 52:11.083
If we don t do it now,
we ll never get a chance to.

52:11.083 --> 52:12.208
Open.

52:17.542 --> 52:18.875
- Archery?

52:18.875 --> 52:22.458
- One round, winner-take-all
for the unquestioned,

52:22.458 --> 52:25.125
undefeated all-camp
archery champion

52:25.125 --> 52:28.333
throughout this
and all affiliated universes.

52:28.333 --> 52:30.792
No audience, no witnesses,

52:30.792 --> 52:34.458
just two gladiators in the
ultimate battle for supremacy.

52:34.458 --> 52:37.083
- Yeah, well,
that s just not fair.

52:37.083 --> 52:38.792
You get to practice
year-round,

52:38.792 --> 52:41.375
and I haven t picked up
a bow in forever.

52:41.375 --> 52:43.667
- Well, if you d like
to relinquish your title,

52:43.667 --> 52:45.458
I ll gladly accept
your forfeiture.

52:45.458 --> 52:47.542
- Just giving you the
opportunity to save face.

52:57.583 --> 52:59.125
That was just
a practice round, so...

52:59.125 --> 53:00.750
- Fine.

53:07.583 --> 53:09.166
Well, your stance is too tight.

53:09.166 --> 53:10.750
Got to bend your knees.

53:10.750 --> 53:12.333
- Okay.

53:12.333 --> 53:13.458
- Lift your elbow.

53:13.458 --> 53:16.250
Keep it parallel
with the ground.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.834
Now fix your eye on the target.

53:21.959 --> 53:25.875
Slow your breath
and just let go.

53:30.709 --> 53:32.041
That s good.

53:32.041 --> 53:33.041
- That s really good.

53:33.041 --> 53:35.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:11.834 --> 54:15.333
That was fun.

54:15.333 --> 54:16.792
And you were right.

54:16.792 --> 54:18.542
I really needed that.

54:18.542 --> 54:21.291
- Undefeated all-camp
archery champion

54:21.291 --> 54:23.625
throughout this
and all affiliated universes.

54:23.625 --> 54:26.834
- That s right.

54:26.834 --> 54:29.000
I can t believe
the week s almost over.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.458
- Yeah, time flies.

54:31.458 --> 54:34.166
- Yeah.

54:34.166 --> 54:37.000
Well, I better brush up
for the presentation.

54:39.458 --> 54:41.417
- Good luck.

54:41.417 --> 54:42.875
- Thanks.

54:45.250 --> 54:47.375
Bye.

54:47.375 --> 54:48.875
[door opens]

54:54.750 --> 54:58.667
Hey.
- Having fun?

54:58.667 --> 55:00.667
- What do you mean?
- On the retreat.

55:00.667 --> 55:01.959
- Yeah.

55:01.959 --> 55:04.250
It s always nice
to get out of the office.

55:04.250 --> 55:06.291
- I heard this place
used to be a summer camp.

55:06.291 --> 55:07.500
- Mm-hmm.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.041
- I used to love camp--

55:09.041 --> 55:16.041
the friends, the activities,
first love.

55:16.041 --> 55:18.917
- Yeah, well, I wouldn t know
anything about that.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.458
- I m gonna go rehearse.

55:23.458 --> 55:25.625
I ll see you
at the presentations.

55:25.625 --> 55:27.041
- Mm-hmm.

55:31.667 --> 55:34.917
- "Insert wheel pin into axle."

55:41.834 --> 55:44.250
Well, that took two hours.

55:44.250 --> 55:46.750
Not bad, if I say so myself.

55:50.667 --> 55:51.834
- What s wrong?

55:51.834 --> 55:55.041
- Look, I can t even
put together a stroller.

55:55.041 --> 55:57.125
- Laurie, I told you
I d take care of that.

55:57.125 --> 55:59.500
- It s not just a stroller.

55:59.500 --> 56:01.125
I m a lawyer.

56:01.125 --> 56:03.583
I don t know anything
about being a mommy.

56:03.583 --> 56:06.500
- I don t know anything
about being a father either.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.417
We ll learn.

56:08.417 --> 56:12.542
- I m like a moody,
nauseous beach ball.

56:12.542 --> 56:14.625
- Are you kidding?
You re beautiful.

56:18.625 --> 56:21.834
- And you re so calm and steady
through this whole thing.

56:21.834 --> 56:22.959
I don t get it.

56:22.959 --> 56:24.709
Why aren t you scared?

56:24.709 --> 56:28.542
- Laurie, I m terrified.

56:28.542 --> 56:30.709
I wake up in a cold sweat.

56:30.709 --> 56:32.959
The other day I dropped an egg,
and I nearly broke down,

56:32.959 --> 56:35.375
thinking, "What if that
had been the baby?"

56:35.375 --> 56:37.500
I m just trying
to be strong for you.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.792
- I don t want you
to be strong for me.

56:39.792 --> 56:42.709
I want to know that you re
feeling the same things I am,

56:42.709 --> 56:44.583
that you re thinking we re never
gonna go out to dinner again

56:44.583 --> 56:47.083
or how we re gonna be
terrible parents.

56:47.083 --> 56:48.166
- But that s the thing.

56:48.166 --> 56:50.125
I think we re
gonna be great parents.

56:50.125 --> 56:52.333
We love each other,
and we re gonna love this baby,

56:52.333 --> 56:55.166
and we ll probably make
a million mistakes a day,

56:55.166 --> 56:57.625
but we ll figure it out.

56:57.625 --> 57:01.500
We re in this together.

57:01.500 --> 57:05.125
And I m much more careful
with eggs these days.

57:05.125 --> 57:07.834
- Hmm, you better be.

57:11.583 --> 57:13.333
- And in the weeks following,

57:13.333 --> 57:18.333
employers reported not only
a 10% increase in productivity

57:18.333 --> 57:22.750
but a drastically improved
company morale.

57:22.750 --> 57:23.959
- Good job.

57:23.959 --> 57:25.875
[applause]

57:25.875 --> 57:28.542
Okay, so that s four down,
one to go.

57:28.542 --> 57:29.834
Allison, your team s up.

57:29.834 --> 57:31.041
- Yes.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.792
Do you remember the first time
you went to summer camp?

57:41.792 --> 57:45.917
The wide-open spaces,
the fresh air,

57:45.917 --> 57:48.625
trees so tall
you couldn t see the top?

57:48.625 --> 57:53.125
Awed by the possibilities
and open to new adventures?

57:53.125 --> 57:56.417
Where did
that sense of wonder go?

57:56.417 --> 57:59.375
- Nowadays we lock ourselves
in our offices.

57:59.375 --> 58:01.333
We work nights and weekends,

58:01.333 --> 58:03.166
so these company retreats

58:03.166 --> 58:06.625
where we can get back in touch
with that sense of wonder

58:06.625 --> 58:08.083
seem like a great idea.

58:08.083 --> 58:09.959
- Companies pay
huge amounts of money

58:09.959 --> 58:12.291
bringing their employees
on these kinds of retreats

58:12.291 --> 58:15.083
to help with team-building
and camaraderie.

58:15.083 --> 58:17.583
- And though they are helpful,

58:17.583 --> 58:20.917
the research shows that after
just weeks back to work,

58:20.917 --> 58:22.875
the bumps in productivity
and morale

58:22.875 --> 58:25.333
go back to pre-retreat levels.

58:25.333 --> 58:26.959
So what s missing?

58:26.959 --> 58:30.250
How do we turn these retreats
into not just an experience

58:30.250 --> 58:34.750
but lasting, treasured memories?

58:34.750 --> 58:38.750
- Now, the key to improving
long-term employee morale

58:38.750 --> 58:41.917
is not just work satisfaction.

58:41.917 --> 58:44.750
It s life satisfaction.

58:44.750 --> 58:46.875
And that comes from
not just a great work life

58:46.875 --> 58:50.542
but from spending time
with the people we love.

58:50.542 --> 58:52.333
- So how do we bring this
all together?

58:52.333 --> 58:57.667
- Camp Viewpoint used to be
a summer camp for kids.

58:57.667 --> 59:00.291
Why not embrace those roots?

59:00.291 --> 59:03.208
- Instead of employees
coming up here alone,

59:03.208 --> 59:06.083
they bring their families
and share the experience.

59:06.083 --> 59:08.709
- While the employees are
engaged in retreat activities,

59:08.709 --> 59:10.667
their spouses and kids
will be engaged

59:10.667 --> 59:13.500
in summer camp activities
from other parts of the camp.

59:13.500 --> 59:16.959
- And then at night
they all join together.

59:16.959 --> 59:17.959
- As you can see,

59:17.959 --> 59:19.792
the camp
is more than large enough

59:19.792 --> 59:21.250
to accommodate the two parts.

59:21.250 --> 59:24.041
- And the additional guests
would increase profits

59:24.041 --> 59:26.834
and even fund some
underprivileged youth programs

59:26.834 --> 59:28.083
during the slow season.

59:28.083 --> 59:29.750
- Now, over the course
of this week,

59:29.750 --> 59:33.542
we have all come to realize
what a special place this is.

59:33.542 --> 59:35.083
Spending it
with the ones we love

59:35.083 --> 59:37.000
would only make it more special.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.750
After all, the whole point
is building a team,

59:39.750 --> 59:44.542
and what better team is there
than family?

59:44.542 --> 59:49.458
Camp Viewpoint:
not work life, not home life.

59:49.458 --> 59:51.792
Just life.

59:51.792 --> 59:53.291
[applause]

59:53.291 --> 59:55.834
- Good job!
Good job.

59:55.834 --> 59:59.667
Now here comes the hard part,
choosing just one.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:03.417
So I m gonna go to my room
and do that.

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:05.667
I ll meet you back here
for the barbecue, okay?

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:06.709
And it s our last dinner.

01:00:06.709 --> 01:00:08.208
Please don t be late.

01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:09.583
Excellent work, everybody.

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.125
I m proud of everyone.

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:17.875
- Congratulations.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:21.208
That was...different.

01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:22.625
- Thank you.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.917
So what d you think?

01:00:31.917 --> 01:00:33.542
- It s a good first effort.

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:35.458
- A good first effort?

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:39.959
- Yeah, it was a bit sentimental
for a business crowd.

01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:42.875
I think this place
may be getting to your head.

01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:45.709
- What s that supposed to mean?

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:48.291
- It just means I think
you re losing your edge.

01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:51.125
It s not you, Allison,

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:55.250
and the sooner we get home,
the better.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:01:00.583
- See, I think this is me,
Bryce.

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:03.041
I think it s more me
than I ve been in a while,

01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:05.792
and if you don t like this me,

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:10.250
then I don t think
we ll work together.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.792
- This is about that guy,
isn t it?

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:14.041
- This isn t about Cody, Bryce.

01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:17.000
This is about us.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.959
It s not working.

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:21.375
- Let s get ready for dinner,

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:23.083
and we ll talk about it
when we get home.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:25.000
- Bryce--
- When we get home.

01:01:38.792 --> 01:01:41.125
- Nice job
on the presentation today.

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.959
- Oh, thanks, I appreciate it.

01:01:42.959 --> 01:01:44.208
You know, I was actually
gonna tell you that

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:45.500
when you were talking about--

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.500
- Are you okay?

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.917
- Yeah, no, yeah.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.750
I m--I ve just never seen you
dressed up before.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.125
Are you wearing makeup?

01:01:56.125 --> 01:02:00.625
- Yeah, I just felt like
wearing it for a change.

01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:02.875
Is it too much?

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:07.625
- No, no, it looks very nice.

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:09.041
- Thank you.

01:02:12.041 --> 01:02:13.166
[applause]

01:02:13.166 --> 01:02:15.125
- Welcome to the end
of the retreat

01:02:15.125 --> 01:02:21.125
and the final
barbecue extravaganza.

01:02:21.125 --> 01:02:22.625
I can t believe
it s over already.

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:24.083
I ve had such a great time.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:27.917
So for our final project we had
five teams come together

01:02:27.917 --> 01:02:30.000
and create marketing campaigns

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.667
for this camp right here,
Camp Viewpoint.

01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.083
And I have to tell you
I m so proud

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.667
of each and every one of you.

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:38.166
Everybody did
such an amazing job.

01:02:38.166 --> 01:02:40.208
Your individuality,
the way that you just,

01:02:40.208 --> 01:02:43.500
I don t know, reflected your own
unique approach to this piece

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.125
made it very difficult
for me to pick a winner.

01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:48.959
But as you know,
I had to choose one,

01:02:48.959 --> 01:02:52.041
and it was Allison.

01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:53.208
Allison, come on up.

01:02:53.208 --> 01:02:54.208
[applause]

01:02:54.208 --> 01:02:56.875
Come on up, come on up,
come on up.

01:02:56.875 --> 01:02:59.125
No, listen,
I want to share something.

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:02.208
Marketing is all about getting
to the heart of the product.

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:04.083
Allison took that heart.

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:06.041
She turned it
into something innovative,

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:09.458
something creative and poignant
and just really delicious.

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:11.417
So great job, okay?

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:13.542
Thank you,
congratulations, Allison.

01:03:13.542 --> 01:03:16.500
[applause]

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:21.750
- Thank you, Nathan,
for your support and guidance.

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.500
And just...thank you.

other than hospital food.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.709
Do you want anything?

01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:45.875
- Two of
whatever you re having.

01:13:53.417 --> 01:13:57.291
- Your whole life
is about to change.

01:13:57.291 --> 01:14:01.750
- Well, that s how it goes.

01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.917
Things change,

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:05.208
and you just have to jump in
with both feet.

01:14:07.417 --> 01:14:09.542
Know what I mean?

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:11.041
- Are you talking
about yourself,

01:14:11.041 --> 01:14:15.041
or are you talking
about me and Cody?

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:18.875
- I m just being your friend.

01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:22.000
As a wise person once told me,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.875
don t be afraid
of what you re giving up.

01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:29.208
Think of everything
you re getting in return.

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:09.417
- Working late?

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:12.208
- Yeah, just putting
some finishing touches

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:14.583
on the presentation.

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:16.750
- It s a big day tomorrow.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.834
I m sure you re gonna do great.

01:15:18.834 --> 01:15:21.667
- Thank you.

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:26.792
- I wanted to apologize about
how I acted on the retreat.

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:32.625
I was jealous and afraid
of losing you.

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:35.625
- No, I m sorry.

01:15:35.625 --> 01:15:39.750
I should have been honest
with you from the beginning.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:41.625
- Well, maybe after
your presentation tomorrow

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:45.208
we can go out for some dinner
and talk things out.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:51.417
- Bryce, I think
you re a great guy.

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:55.500
I just don t think you re
the right guy for me anymore.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:08.250
- I m disappointed,
but I can t say I m surprised.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:14.834
I ve never seen you as happy
as you were on the retreat.

01:16:14.834 --> 01:16:16.875
It s funny how the biggest
hearts only have room

01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:18.500
for one more person.

01:16:42.375 --> 01:16:45.125
- Have you seen
the projection analysis?

01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:46.542
- Right here.

01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:47.709
- Thank you.

01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:49.333
[phone ringing]

01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:50.875
- Allison Sinclair s office.

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:51.875
- Hey, it s Dan.

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:53.083
- Oh, hi, one moment.

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:54.083
Allison, I have--

01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:56.291
- Take a message, please.

01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:58.917
- Sorry, can I take a message
and have her call you back?

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:01.041
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:17:01.041 --> 01:17:03.709
Please have her call me
as soon as possible.

01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:05.125
It s really important.

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.750
Thank you.

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:14.125
- Well, look at you.

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:15.375
What time s your appointment?

01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:17.208
- He ll be here
in a couple hours,

01:17:17.208 --> 01:17:19.583
so I figured I d take a walk
around the grounds.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:21.125
- Let me know
if you need anything.

01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:22.625
- Yup.

01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:42.875
- Oops.
- Oh, I ll get that.

01:17:46.834 --> 01:17:48.834
- Hey, um...

01:17:48.834 --> 01:17:51.917
Yeah, so,
after the presentation,

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:55.917
would you maybe want
to go get some coffee with me?

01:17:55.917 --> 01:17:57.250
- Sure.

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:58.834
- Cool, yeah.

01:17:58.834 --> 01:17:59.834
All right.

01:17:59.834 --> 01:18:00.834
- Okay.

01:18:00.834 --> 01:18:02.208
- All right.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
- Good afternoon.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.125
My name is Allison Sinclair.

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.291
I m excited
to present to you my pitch

01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:14.667
for Epicurean Fresh
Frozen Entrees.

01:18:14.667 --> 01:18:16.291
- Okay, okay, there s my girl.

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.291
Are you ready to go?

01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:19.709
- Yeah, I just keep thinking

01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:20.959
something terrible s
gonna happen.

01:18:20.959 --> 01:18:22.083
- What?

01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:23.959
Come on, come on,
the pitch is top-notch.

01:18:23.959 --> 01:18:25.250
You re gonna be great.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.917
- Yeah, I guess
I m just nervous.

01:18:26.917 --> 01:18:27.917
- Well, that s normal.

01:18:27.917 --> 01:18:29.500
I mean, that means you care,
right?

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.709
Plus this is a big moment.

01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:32.250
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.917
- Besides, after today you re
gonna be on the fast track,

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:37.542
and your life is gonna change.

01:18:37.542 --> 01:18:38.792
Okay, let s do this.

01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:40.291
- Okay.

01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:01.125
- Good afternoon.

01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:03.667
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:19:03.667 --> 01:19:05.458
- Glad we re finally able
to finalize this deal.

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:07.375
- Yeah, sorry I ve been
dragging my feet.

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.834
Some circumstances
were keeping my busy.

01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:10.834
- Ah.

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:12.625
This area s just breathtaking.

01:19:12.625 --> 01:19:15.834
I can see why you love it.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:16.875
- Come on.

01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:18.333
We re all set up inside.

01:19:22.166 --> 01:19:25.458
- Epicurean Fresh
Frozen Entrees.

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:28.500
We ll take care of dinner
so you can--

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:33.250
so you can take care
of what really matters.

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:34.500
[sighs]

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:59.250
[phone ringing]

01:20:02.542 --> 01:20:03.542
- Camp Viewpoint.

01:20:03.542 --> 01:20:05.458
- Dan, it s Allison.

01:20:05.458 --> 01:20:07.709
- Allison, I m glad you called.

01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:10.250
- Yeah, um, I got your message.

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:11.792
Is everything all right?

01:20:11.792 --> 01:20:13.583
- Well, not exactly.

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:14.667
You remember that contract

01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:16.583
Cody had drawn up
for the developer?

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:17.875
- Yeah.

01:20:17.875 --> 01:20:19.542
- They re meeting right now.

01:20:19.542 --> 01:20:21.000
He s selling the land.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.834
They re gonna turn it
into a resort.

01:20:22.834 --> 01:20:24.291
- What?

01:20:24.291 --> 01:20:26.333
- He s closing the camp.

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:27.959
I thought you should know.

01:20:27.959 --> 01:20:29.792
- Allison.

01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:32.625
They re on their way.

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:35.250
- Okay, Dan, thanks.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.250
- All right.

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:37.709
You take care.

01:20:41.583 --> 01:20:47.291
- We ll have 500 rooms,
including 73 guest suites,

01:20:47.291 --> 01:20:50.000
indoor and outdoor pools.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.208
- It looks so...

01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:57.000
different.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.500
- We want to integrate
with the setting

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.417
to provide the ultimate
outdoor experience

01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:05.625
for people who still want
the luxury of indoors.

01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:09.500
- Yeah, I think that is...

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.542
- So nothing s changed.

01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:11.792
It s gonna stay.

01:21:11.792 --> 01:21:13.959
I ll open, and we ll give it
to Allison to close.

01:21:13.959 --> 01:21:14.959
- Sounds perfect.

01:21:14.959 --> 01:21:15.959
- And there she is.

01:21:15.959 --> 01:21:18.083
Hey, are you ready
to dazzle them?

01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:26.125
- Nathan, I m sorry,
I can t do this.

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:27.417
- What are you talking about?

01:21:27.417 --> 01:21:31.792
The client is right outside.

01:21:31.792 --> 01:21:37.667
- You have been a teacher
and a mentor

01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:42.709
and have given me
an amazing opportunity,

01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:46.333
but you asked me
to show you what s in my heart,

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:51.875
and it s just not here anymore.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:55.041
- Wow.

01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:58.625
You re serious.

01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:01.250
- Yeah.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.667
I m not gonna leave you
in a lurch.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:09.000
There is someone who is more
than capable of taking over.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.500
Joy.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.583
- Are you kidding?

01:22:11.583 --> 01:22:12.750
She s an assistant.

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.000
- She knows the material,
Vanessa.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.041
You don t.

01:22:16.041 --> 01:22:19.291
- Joy, can you do this?

01:22:19.291 --> 01:22:21.166
- This is crazy, Nathan.

01:22:21.166 --> 01:22:22.750
- Look, this is my decision,
okay?

01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:25.166
Joy, are you ready?

01:22:29.875 --> 01:22:31.667
- I m ready.

01:22:31.667 --> 01:22:34.917
- Good, then it s yours.

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.000
- Good luck.

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:48.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:49.875
- You okay?

01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:56.750
- Yeah, yeah, I just need
to go back to camp.

01:22:56.750 --> 01:23:00.208
- Yes, you do.

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.625
- Thank you.

01:23:06.625 --> 01:23:07.959
- All we need
is your signature,

01:23:07.959 --> 01:23:10.291
and we ll get the first
installment to you.

01:23:20.417 --> 01:23:21.625
Congratulations.

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:24.875
You are about
to become a rich man.

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:41.834
- Allison?

01:23:41.834 --> 01:23:43.583
- [panting] Don t do it.

01:23:43.583 --> 01:23:45.250
Don t do it.

01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:46.291
- What?

01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:47.875
- Don t sell it.

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:49.583
It means--
it means too much to you,

01:23:49.583 --> 01:23:53.333
and it means too much to me.

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:55.125
I made a mistake.

01:23:55.125 --> 01:23:56.959
I was afraid
I was giving up a career,

01:23:56.959 --> 01:24:03.291
but I forgot
about what really matters.

01:24:03.291 --> 01:24:06.542
- And what about Bryce?

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.166
- He s not right for me.

01:24:09.166 --> 01:24:15.333
I m looking for someone
a little more rugged.

01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:19.291
- Well, you re too late.

01:24:19.291 --> 01:24:22.625
The developer left
an hour ago.

01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:25.667
- What?

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:27.709
- I couldn t do it.

01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:29.792
- You didn t sell it?

01:24:29.792 --> 01:24:31.625
- What am I gonna do
with a bunch of money?

01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:33.917
I m a camp counselor.

01:24:33.917 --> 01:24:35.166
You know,
if we re gonna do this,

01:24:35.166 --> 01:24:38.458
we re gonna need
a good marketing executive.

01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:41.041
- Lucky for you, I know someone
who s looking for a job.

01:24:46.417 --> 01:24:50.458
- ♪ I m back where I belong ♪

01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:54.500
♪ Back where I come from ♪

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.792
♪ Not too far from home ♪

01:24:57.792 --> 01:25:03.250
♪ I m back where I belong ♪

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.375
- I m sorry.

01:25:04.375 --> 01:25:06.667
We have no more openings
for the next six months,

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:08.500
but we have a couple after that.

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.750
You better take them quick
if you re interested.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.792
They re going quickly.

01:25:13.792 --> 01:25:15.417
- You did so great.

01:25:15.417 --> 01:25:16.709
I m so proud of you.

01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:18.500
Head in there,
and I ll see you later, okay?

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.917
Nice job.

01:25:19.917 --> 01:25:22.917
- Nice going, finally got her
to try the rock wall.

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:25.208
- Yeah, she was scared
of heights,

01:25:25.208 --> 01:25:27.750
but I told her sometimes the
things that look the scariest

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:31.083
end up being the best decisions
you ll ever make.

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:32.375
- Nice.
- Yeah.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:37.291
- Also told her
that s how I met my fiance.

01:25:37.291 --> 01:25:38.875
- Can you fill in
down at the company retreat

01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:40.333
for a little bit?

01:25:40.333 --> 01:25:41.875
Got a meeting
