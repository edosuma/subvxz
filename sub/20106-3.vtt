WEBVTT

00:01.936 --> 00:03.536
So, uh, what are we doing?

00:03.568 --> 00:05.568
Are we just jumping
right into this, or...

00:05.656 --> 00:07.251
How are you assholes even here?

00:07.294 --> 00:08.634
We followed you.

00:08.659 --> 00:09.548
- Duh.
- Duh.

00:09.573 --> 00:10.251
Hmm!

00:10.276 --> 00:11.813
Looks like she's having
a rough night.

00:11.876 --> 00:14.321
- Her? What about me?
- Will you shut up?

00:14.438 --> 00:16.531
Will you stop
illustrating my point?

00:16.601 --> 00:17.898
So, is this the part where

00:17.953 --> 00:19.695
you tell me it's not
what it looks like?

00:19.726 --> 00:21.734
- I don't know. What does it look like?
- You tell me.

00:21.820 --> 00:25.195
- It's... not what it looks like?
- Which is...

00:25.281 --> 00:28.117
Murder, figgis, you
insufferable little prick!

00:28.195 --> 00:29.311
It looks like murder!

00:29.336 --> 00:31.179
Yeah, I guess it does, kind of.

00:31.258 --> 00:32.406
But it shows what you know,

00:32.476 --> 00:34.820
because it's only accessory
after the fact.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.914
We were merely
using this poor

00:36.961 --> 00:39.203
pre-deceased young woman
to fake my death.

00:39.228 --> 00:40.279
- What?
- Why?

00:40.304 --> 00:41.319
She's trying to get out

00:41.344 --> 00:43.615
of a quasi-incestuous
home-life situation.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.648
How quasi?

00:44.687 --> 00:46.609
Like, a four?

00:46.696 --> 00:48.515
- Meh.
- Put a ham in it, Poovey.

00:48.594 --> 00:50.320
What's your story, lady?
Who are you?

00:50.422 --> 00:52.351
Charlotte Vandertunt?

00:52.422 --> 00:55.429
Heiress to the vast
Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?

00:55.500 --> 00:57.797
- Really?
- Schmancy.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.820
Well, then, seeing as how
that's the case,

00:59.883 --> 01:01.453
are the keys in the rolls?

01:01.554 --> 01:03.195
Yeah. They're...
Wait. Why?

01:03.320 --> 01:05.125
Because I'm going to drive it,

01:05.226 --> 01:08.062
and sergeant Poovey is going
to drive you in my car.

01:08.133 --> 01:10.992
To jail. Because you're both
under arrest for murder.

01:11.101 --> 01:12.156
- What?
- Goddamn it.

01:12.226 --> 01:14.080
- Poovey?
- Huh? Oh.

01:14.156 --> 01:15.492
Now we'll see how you like

01:15.530 --> 01:17.804
getting your tits
screwed off for a change.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.750
Wh... what?

01:19.820 --> 01:22.500
Remember? 'Cause you screwed
his wife's tits off.

01:22.570 --> 01:25.070
- Damn it, Poovey!
- What? Figuratively!

01:25.164 --> 01:27.312
Well, either way, I can
tell you right now i...

01:27.406 --> 01:29.656
Wait. Did you say
"a change" or just "change,"

01:29.734 --> 01:30.804
as in spare change?

01:30.867 --> 01:31.992
Huh! What change?

01:32.101 --> 01:34.304
They'll be passing you around
for half a pack of smokes.

01:34.414 --> 01:36.820
Pff! I'm worth
at least two packs.

01:36.859 --> 01:38.008
Pff!
You know.

01:38.054 --> 01:41.289
And, Poovey,
book her as a Jane Doe.

01:43.163 --> 01:44.453
A what?

01:44.769 --> 01:47.329

Well, at least let me
talk to her.

02:26.523 --> 02:28.398
No. I told you, you can't.

02:28.562 --> 02:31.269
Little Miss Vanderpanties
is in solitary,

02:31.356 --> 02:32.605
down in the sub-basement.

02:32.692 --> 02:34.122
Yeah! And why do you
think that is?

02:34.184 --> 02:35.575
How the hell should I know?

02:35.649 --> 02:38.013
- Wh... because you do!
- No, I don't.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.482
Are you booking Charlotte
as a Jane Doe?

02:40.552 --> 02:41.984
He's gonna keep her
locked up here,

02:42.067 --> 02:44.016
call her parents
posing as a kidnapper,

02:44.075 --> 02:46.821
and use the ransom money to
square things with Len Trexler

02:46.864 --> 02:49.024
for losing his
Chinese sex slaves!

02:49.122 --> 02:51.086
Oh. Thought you meant
besides that.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.833
The Chinese sex slaves,
by the way, that you let goooo!

02:54.999 --> 02:57.006
Keep your frickin' voice down.

02:57.038 --> 02:58.054
Ow!

02:58.108 --> 03:00.600
And speaking of which,
where the hell are they?

03:05.029 --> 03:07.229
Your house?
Are you shitting me?

03:07.311 --> 03:10.749
Aw, I wouldn't shit you.
You're my favorite turd.

03:10.814 --> 03:12.374
But what are you gonna do
with them, Poovey?

03:12.452 --> 03:14.022
What's your long-term plan?

03:17.186 --> 03:20.159
Like living with a bunch
of roosters.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.381
- That's your plan?
- Well, it's <i> a</i> plan.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.952
I mean, obviously,
we'll put it to a vote, but...

03:25.021 --> 03:27.342
- Not after I tell Figgis...
- Ow!

03:27.464 --> 03:28.600
Don't be stupid!

03:28.699 --> 03:30.327
If you want me to talk him
out of this murder rap,

03:30.381 --> 03:31.913
you'll keep
your damn piehole shut!

03:32.038 --> 03:34.389
Poovey. Poovey!

03:34.538 --> 03:36.741
I could actually go
for some pie.

03:36.807 --> 03:39.381
Come on! Come on! Move your asses!

03:39.426 --> 03:40.926
Yeah, yeah, keep on bitching,

03:41.045 --> 03:42.975
if ya want me to bust
your heads open for ya.

03:43.045 --> 03:44.849
Hey, uh, could I order some pie?

03:44.905 --> 03:46.478
Or have you singlehandedly

03:46.514 --> 03:49.319
depleted the global
strategic pie reserves?

03:53.030 --> 03:55.732
- Whoo! Are you crazy?
- You wanna get yourself killed?

03:55.811 --> 03:58.326
Oh, my God!
Is diabetes contagious?

03:58.389 --> 04:00.997
Hang on. Tsk.
I know you from Dreamland.

04:01.053 --> 04:02.998
Dreamland?
Do you know Lana Kane?

04:03.037 --> 04:04.810
We're her Band, man.
I'm Floyd.

04:04.873 --> 04:06.701
This is Verl.
That's Cliff, and that's...

04:06.774 --> 04:08.844
Ray Gillette.
I'm kind of the Bandleader.

04:08.912 --> 04:10.138
- We didn't vote on that.
- No, you're not.

04:10.224 --> 04:12.308
I-I'm Archer.
I'm a private eye,

04:12.333 --> 04:14.739
doing a little work
for your boss, Mother.

04:14.810 --> 04:16.245
So what are you in here for?

04:16.269 --> 04:18.247
Well, murder, but technically,

04:18.357 --> 04:19.778
it was just gross abuse
of a corpse.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.841
How about you guys?
What are you in for?

04:21.954 --> 04:24.420
Yeah, Ray.
What are we in here for?

04:24.560 --> 04:25.921
Okay. My turn.

04:26.052 --> 04:27.716
Okay. Hey, come on. Let me...
Hey, relax.

04:27.771 --> 04:29.177
Hold on.
You're gonna get yours.

04:29.232 --> 04:30.285
You'll get a turn, man.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.360
- Can I please...
- Ray, take it easy, man.

04:32.412 --> 04:33.568
Goddamn it!

04:33.607 --> 04:36.622
I insist you let me share
your Marijuana cigarette!

04:40.204 --> 04:42.935
Well, serves y'all right
for being so damn stingy.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.396
- Serves who right?
- "Whom."

04:44.443 --> 04:46.490
How is six years in jail right?

04:46.591 --> 04:49.076
Six years?
For one lousy goof-butt?

04:49.154 --> 04:52.513
It's our <i> second</i> offense.

04:52.638 --> 04:55.427
I am lovin'
this Marijuana cigarette!

04:58.198 --> 05:00.440
Or it will be, once they
run our prints

05:00.511 --> 05:02.612
and figure out
we gave 'em fake names.

05:02.745 --> 05:05.589
Ha! Oh, man, was my fake
name not the best?

05:05.792 --> 05:07.706
I swear, i am such a pistol.

05:07.792 --> 05:09.300
You're lucky
I don't have a pistol.

05:09.354 --> 05:11.567
Or even a belt.
Or even shoelaces.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.714
What if I told you I could
get you guys outta here,

05:13.784 --> 05:15.136
no charges filed?

05:15.239 --> 05:16.597
I need your help
to do it, though.

05:16.659 --> 05:18.073
To do what, exactly?

05:18.175 --> 05:19.605
Escape, obviously.

05:19.675 --> 05:21.978
- What?
- What do we have to do?

05:22.034 --> 05:25.401
Well, for starters, I'm gonna
need you to forgive me.

05:25.518 --> 05:27.659
Forgive you? For wh...

05:27.804 --> 05:30.901
- Damn, Ray! Really?
- Ugh!

05:31.003 --> 05:32.745
Damn, man! Why the hell'd
you do that?

05:32.836 --> 05:35.448
Hey, guard, we got
a sick man in here!

05:35.473 --> 05:36.486
Ohh.

05:36.511 --> 05:37.856
Aw, man, I'm gonna be sick too.

05:37.881 --> 05:40.196
- No, you are not.
- Well, I am.

05:40.197 --> 05:42.327
- Guard!
- You assholes!

05:42.384 --> 05:43.801
Whoever puked in my cell,

05:43.826 --> 05:46.361
I'm gonna make ya mop it up
and suck on the mop!

05:48.197 --> 05:49.728
Oh, man!

05:49.868 --> 05:52.618
- Goddamn it!
- Seriously.

05:52.681 --> 05:54.183
Oh, you think that's funny,
you shit-heel?

05:54.275 --> 05:55.645
Oh, sorry.

05:55.782 --> 05:58.853
I'm just a sucker for physical
comedy. Case in point...

06:02.052 --> 06:03.345
Daaaamn!

06:03.453 --> 06:05.322
Remind me never
to rent you a mule.

06:05.524 --> 06:07.299
Why would I want to rent a mule?

06:07.357 --> 06:09.835
- Maybe you're afraid of commitment.
- So, listen.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.960
What do you think about our
chances of getting out of here?

06:12.032 --> 06:13.743
Hmm. I don't know.

06:13.845 --> 06:16.165
Four?
Out of... five?

06:16.267 --> 06:18.696
Why not?

06:22.189 --> 06:24.868
Mother: I'm sorry.
I must have misheard you.

06:24.978 --> 06:26.454
Because it sounded like you said

06:26.525 --> 06:28.314
you're not doing
your second set.

06:28.363 --> 06:29.630
I don't have a Band.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.423
They never came back
from their Smoke Break.

06:31.499 --> 06:35.259
Bet they got arrested again.
Idiots.

06:35.376 --> 06:37.699
What is it with you people
and reefer?

06:37.767 --> 06:40.993
- Do you mean musicians or negroes?
- Pick one.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.109
No, because I'm
going home now, so...

06:43.157 --> 06:44.571
You most certainly are not.

06:44.626 --> 06:46.595
Get up there and
entertain those people.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.962
How? Do you want me
to do a striptease?

06:49.030 --> 06:50.860
- Hmm.
- That was a joke.

06:50.923 --> 06:52.525
- Well, clearly.
- Wha...?

06:52.603 --> 06:55.314
But I wonder. What if
we had a comedy night?

06:55.406 --> 06:58.228
Comedians, little routines...

06:58.323 --> 07:00.556
And where the hell
is the bartender?

07:00.697 --> 07:03.430
Excuse me. Excuse me.

07:03.478 --> 07:06.665
Excuse me! Doctor, where are
you taking this patient?

07:06.751 --> 07:08.743
Yeah, what do we got
going on here?

07:08.861 --> 07:10.689
Tests.
Just some routine tests.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.032
Okay, let's get you
dancin', handsome.

07:13.111 --> 07:14.774
I am handsome.

07:14.962 --> 07:16.914
Maybe I could do
a comedy routine.

07:17.001 --> 07:18.611
I mean, how hard could that be?

07:18.720 --> 07:20.382
- Seriously?
- What?

07:20.454 --> 07:22.095
You look like a Rodeo Clown.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.550
You've clearly
never been to a Rodeo.

07:24.619 --> 07:26.279
Aw, brother, I have.

07:26.353 --> 07:28.173
That was the circus.

07:28.256 --> 07:29.806
No. There were lions.

07:29.891 --> 07:32.540
Look, man, verl's
got to be the cop.

07:32.634 --> 07:34.056
I mean, you know,
no offense, but...

07:34.087 --> 07:36.142
The fact that you feel like
you have to say "no offense"...

07:36.220 --> 07:37.590
- Moot!
- Wait. What?

07:37.598 --> 07:39.598
- What?
- Moot. It's my plan.

07:39.623 --> 07:41.407
- I'm the Cop.
- Come on.

07:41.469 --> 07:43.689
You look like you should
be policing a cornfield.

07:43.771 --> 07:45.267
Arresting crows and shit.

07:45.361 --> 07:47.126
Caw! Caw!
Seriously.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.584
No. I'm the Cop.

07:48.626 --> 07:50.861
For one thing, I have
military experience, so...

07:50.945 --> 07:53.283
Me and Verl were in the Army.
And I was in the Navy.

07:53.322 --> 07:55.532
Well, but, you know,
I didn't segregate the service,

07:55.583 --> 07:57.913
and no offense, but...
But here it comes.

07:57.962 --> 08:00.064
Well, but what did
you do, exactly?

08:00.121 --> 08:02.572
I was in the transport corps.
I was a steward.

08:02.657 --> 08:05.939
- Exactly. So, you know...
- Oh, I get it.

08:06.001 --> 08:07.197
So, no matter how eager

08:07.261 --> 08:09.517
Negroes were to prove
ourselves in combat,

08:09.597 --> 08:11.306
thanks to segregation,
most of us

08:11.344 --> 08:12.853
had to serve in support units.

08:12.934 --> 08:14.892
And driving trucks
and serving coffee

08:14.970 --> 08:16.605
don't exactly make us
war heroes.

08:16.657 --> 08:18.056
No. Come on. Look, I realize

08:18.150 --> 08:20.259
that a segregated service
is just crazy.

08:20.308 --> 08:21.743
Especially when you think about

08:21.809 --> 08:23.579
what we were fighting
for over there, but...

08:23.611 --> 08:26.165
Oh, so now you got a "but."
But if you think about it,

08:26.220 --> 08:29.337
the most racist thing would be
if whenever there was a war,

08:29.431 --> 08:31.876
we <i> only</i> sent Negroes.

08:32.914 --> 08:35.582
- Wow!
- Words fail me.

08:35.623 --> 08:38.407
- I failed my induction screening.
- Well, obviously.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.907
You put the "F" in "4-F."
You know...

08:40.962 --> 08:44.923
Okay, verl can be the cop.
But I'm still squad leader.

08:45.822 --> 08:48.069
And I need you guys
to respect that.

08:48.733 --> 08:50.702
Come on. Come on.
Move your lazy asses.

08:50.842 --> 08:52.972
- Oh, that's good. That's good, Verl.
- Very believable.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.140
Will you quit jamming
my ass with that thing?

08:55.257 --> 08:57.335
He said, coyly.
Silence, prisoner.

08:57.436 --> 08:58.631
Yeah. Shut up.

08:58.757 --> 09:01.179
And the next cop we see,
I'm getting his uniform.

09:01.304 --> 09:02.687
So...

09:04.115 --> 09:05.511
Damn it.

09:05.585 --> 09:08.722
- Complete and total bullshit.
- Dress that line, boy!

09:08.804 --> 09:11.288
Talk about looking
like a scarecrow.

09:11.348 --> 09:14.108
- Caw! Caw!
- Doesn't even work there, so...

09:14.218 --> 09:17.187
So, hey, I'm not an Architect,
but I'm pretty sure

09:17.366 --> 09:19.757
you can't leave a building
through the sub-basement.

09:19.834 --> 09:23.530
So, unless they keep all the
fingerprint cards down here...

09:23.640 --> 09:25.275
In the dampest part
of the building...

09:25.366 --> 09:27.069
What the hell
are we doing down here?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.796
Well, um, it's a surprise.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.608
Oh, goody!
Let me guess.

09:32.747 --> 09:36.171
Is it, uh, a truck full
of my Chinese whores?

09:36.250 --> 09:37.437
Uh, better.

09:37.507 --> 09:38.560
Oh!

09:38.585 --> 09:41.782
A slightly larger truck
full of my Chinese whores?

09:41.804 --> 09:43.843
- Even better.
- I feel like we're gonna run out

09:43.890 --> 09:45.551
of things to fill
with Chinese whores.

09:45.608 --> 09:47.335
No. You'll forget
all about them

09:47.373 --> 09:48.499
when you hear what
I've got for you.

09:48.562 --> 09:50.343
Intriguing.

09:50.444 --> 09:51.866
All right.
Give me a hint.

09:51.969 --> 09:54.801
Two words:
Charlotte Vandertunt.

09:54.858 --> 09:58.402
The heiress to the Vast
Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?

09:58.460 --> 10:01.601
And, by inference, an ideal
target for kidnapping.

10:01.645 --> 10:03.468
I'm not kidnapping a Vandertunt.

10:03.577 --> 10:05.608
You don't have to.
I already did.

10:05.748 --> 10:07.007
Are you serious?

10:07.069 --> 10:09.882
Oh,Figgis, that is
some good work.

10:09.951 --> 10:13.051
- Where is she?
- Downtown, booked in as a Jane Doe.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.202
You got her in that shitty jail?

10:15.289 --> 10:17.767
No! You go get her,
and you bring her here.

10:17.874 --> 10:20.062
- But...
- "But" nothing, ya little weasel.

10:20.140 --> 10:22.452
Bring her to me.
I wanna to meet her.

10:22.917 --> 10:25.210
Oh, I bet she's charming.

10:29.679 --> 10:32.515
What... what is happening
right now?

10:32.573 --> 10:36.202
That's what I'm trying to...
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:36.343 --> 10:37.663
Everything!

10:37.800 --> 10:42.200
I spent my life in jail, and now
I'm a disgusting old woman!

10:42.431 --> 10:44.061
What is she talking about?

10:44.124 --> 10:47.921
Oh! My God, the future
is terrifying!

10:48.054 --> 10:50.209
How many years
have I been in here?

10:50.324 --> 10:52.694
Wha... It's been,
like, a half an hour.

10:52.789 --> 10:55.030
What? No, but...

10:55.171 --> 10:57.054
But then... how...

10:57.429 --> 10:59.161
How are there negro policemen?

10:59.166 --> 11:01.280
Uh, definitely Negro policemen.

11:01.390 --> 11:04.328
I... but...
I mean, since when?

11:04.438 --> 11:06.282
In L.A.?
I wanna say...

11:06.351 --> 11:07.974
Was it 1886?

11:07.998 --> 11:11.127
Yep. Patrolman
Robert w. Stewart.

11:11.194 --> 11:12.788
Big beat-walkin' Bob.

11:12.827 --> 11:14.510
- They called him that?
- How should I know?

11:14.515 --> 11:16.288
Uh...

11:16.350 --> 11:18.249
Well, then,
I don't know what to say.

11:18.352 --> 11:20.413
I am simply mortified.

11:20.483 --> 11:22.890
Please accept
my apology. I...

11:23.069 --> 11:26.366
You're my first Negroes.

11:27.483 --> 11:29.462
So, was this a surprise?

11:29.537 --> 11:31.858
Because I already know
a crazy lady. His aunt Marva.

11:31.966 --> 11:35.204
- Eats paper. By the pound.
- Mm-hmm. God bless that mess.

11:35.265 --> 11:38.371
So, no. The surprise is,
we're gonna seriously jeopardize

11:38.429 --> 11:41.041
our own chance of escaping
by taking her with us.

11:43.144 --> 11:46.022
Poovey:
I say we put it to a vote.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.288
I vote no.

11:47.381 --> 11:49.116
Poovey, come on.
Don't do this.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.952
Make me.
I mean, don't make me.

11:52.050 --> 11:54.991
Look, I know you Cops have to
check your weapons up front,

11:55.046 --> 11:57.882
and there's five of us
and only one of you, so...

11:57.948 --> 12:00.241
So who wants
their ass beat first?

12:00.443 --> 12:01.779
And before you decide,

12:01.829 --> 12:04.589
keep in mind I'm gradually
gonna get more tired,

12:04.640 --> 12:06.726
but also gradually
more berserker.

12:08.069 --> 12:11.899
This is the best...
Day... ever!

12:13.368 --> 12:16.197
Being a negro
must be so exciting.

12:19.217 --> 12:21.154
Lana: Thank you.

12:21.254 --> 12:25.037
Oh, thank you.
Oh, you're too kind.

12:25.158 --> 12:26.826
How's everybody doing tonight?

12:26.917 --> 12:29.347
Doing good?
Having a swell time?

12:29.493 --> 12:31.654
Yeah? Everybody having fun?

12:31.772 --> 12:35.451
Painting the town Red?
Wonderful!

12:35.599 --> 12:37.513
Terrific.

12:37.688 --> 12:39.857
So, I'm gonna want a rematch.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.743
Me too.

12:41.854 --> 12:45.435
What in the hell is she doing?

12:45.539 --> 12:48.069
I'll tell you
who's not having fun.

12:48.114 --> 12:51.008
Al Capone. He just died.
You hear about this?

12:51.084 --> 12:53.031
Yep. He died of Syphilis.

12:53.117 --> 12:56.473
Wouldn't wanna be that broad,
would ya?

12:56.576 --> 12:58.286
Hi, alphonse?

12:58.397 --> 13:00.801
Yeah, it's me, trixie.

13:00.893 --> 13:03.036
Yeah, so, i was just callin'

13:03.096 --> 13:06.739
to say thanks
for a such a lovely evenin'.

13:06.799 --> 13:08.606
Yeah, me too.

13:08.658 --> 13:11.658
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

13:11.771 --> 13:14.114
Yeah, so listen, um...

13:14.238 --> 13:16.239
Tsk.

13:17.511 --> 13:20.075
You know, like she's calling

13:20.136 --> 13:23.876
notorious criminal Al Capone to
tell him she gave him Syphilis.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.731
That's... that's
pretty awkward, right?

13:27.012 --> 13:28.997
Although she was probably
a prostitute.

13:29.067 --> 13:31.043
And why you'd give your phone
number to a prostitute...

13:31.238 --> 13:33.543
So... so what else?

13:35.590 --> 13:37.536
You know how pissed off
Figgis is gonna be

13:37.582 --> 13:40.528
when he finds out you walked off
with his million-dollar payday?

13:40.645 --> 13:42.481
Roughly the same
as if he finds out

13:42.568 --> 13:44.928
about your new Chinese
sister-wives?

13:46.678 --> 13:48.309
Oh, goody.

13:48.556 --> 13:51.356
Another sweater.

13:51.477 --> 13:54.645
All right, Archer.
You win this round.

13:54.753 --> 13:57.801
Yeah. I mean, you're handcuffed
to a pipe, so obviously.

13:57.866 --> 14:02.098
- Hey, let's go.
- We'll go when your squad leader says we'll go.

14:02.218 --> 14:04.418
Which is now.
Let's go.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.241
Hang on. We still gotta get
our fingerprint cards.

14:07.302 --> 14:09.270
Oh, right.
Where do they keep them?

14:09.319 --> 14:11.579
Second floor, room 202.

14:11.611 --> 14:14.239
But good luck getting in there without a...

14:16.333 --> 14:18.012
A distraction. Nice!

14:18.137 --> 14:21.168
Poovey: I was gonna say... ooh!
Sprinklers! Nice!

14:21.308 --> 14:23.969
The key, you dickheads!

14:24.122 --> 14:26.864
Ohh, right. Duh.

14:27.046 --> 14:28.637
Whew. What else?

14:28.801 --> 14:31.645
Uh... oh, prostitutes
and, uh, Syphilis. Okay.

14:31.708 --> 14:35.248
So, I heard about a male
prostitute who got Syphilis.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.641
Yeah. Apparently,
he was fine for a while,

14:37.723 --> 14:40.326
but then business
kind of dropped off.

14:42.186 --> 14:44.646
Reminds me... uh, reminds me
of my cousin Eddie.

14:44.694 --> 14:47.596
Uh, he goes to see the family
doctor. Doctor says,

14:47.800 --> 14:50.369
"Well, I've got
some good news and bad news.

14:50.455 --> 14:53.166
The bad news is,
your wife has Syphilis."

14:53.254 --> 14:57.224
"My God," Eddie says,
"what's the good news?" Doctor says,

14:57.280 --> 14:59.571
"Good news is,
she didn't get it from you...

14:59.625 --> 15:02.196
"Based on this

15:02.274 --> 15:06.074
medical examination."

15:06.304 --> 15:08.034
All right. Let's... let's see
what else I got here.

15:08.087 --> 15:09.977
Uh, Syphilis, Syphilis,

15:10.089 --> 15:12.641
Syphilis, Syphilis, Syphilis,
Syphilis, Syphilis...

15:12.684 --> 15:15.383
Oh, hey! How 'bout
that taft-hartley act?

15:15.506 --> 15:17.201
Man:
Show us your tits!

15:17.992 --> 15:19.792
I mean...

15:19.999 --> 15:22.078
Oh, jeez, I'm getting wet!

15:22.196 --> 15:23.453
Will you hurry up?

15:23.562 --> 15:26.313
Hang on. I got everybody's
but mine. Uh...

15:30.094 --> 15:32.157
Here it is!
Oh, my God.

15:32.262 --> 15:33.735
Oh, it's hilari...

15:36.182 --> 15:37.736
"Phil Mccracken."

15:39.960 --> 15:42.090
Right?

15:42.793 --> 15:46.137
What the hell is going on here?

15:46.282 --> 15:49.614
Uh, do what now?
I said, what the hell's going on here?

15:49.681 --> 15:52.786
It's a... a prisoner... prisoner transport.

15:52.965 --> 15:55.965
Uh, taking these reefer addicts
over to Newton street...

15:56.035 --> 15:57.950
- Oh, well...
- For treatment and counseling.

15:57.979 --> 15:59.179
Nope.
For what?

15:59.219 --> 16:00.849
- Damn it, Floyd.
- Floyd? Wh...

16:00.932 --> 16:02.602
Why did he...
Wait a minute.

16:02.650 --> 16:05.332
- What's your badge and unit number?
- F-Four?

16:05.500 --> 16:06.918
What?

16:09.382 --> 16:11.012
Okay, you are just terrifying.

16:11.087 --> 16:14.364
Shut it, Mccracken.
And "treatment and counseling"?

16:14.553 --> 16:16.123
- Seriously?
- Floyd: What?

16:16.124 --> 16:18.322
I bet in the long run
it's more economical.

16:18.324 --> 16:20.594
Just get in the truck.

16:20.595 --> 16:21.923
Yeah, I'm getting in the truck

16:21.927 --> 16:23.597
because I choose to get
into the truck.

16:23.598 --> 16:26.464
- I...
- Wait! Take me with you.

16:26.465 --> 16:29.165
- We are.
- Oh.

16:29.168 --> 16:31.668
Well, then, I shall thank you
to mind your tone.

16:31.671 --> 16:32.671
What?

16:32.672 --> 16:34.072
I said...

16:34.073 --> 16:35.443
Oh.

16:35.444 --> 16:37.671
- I said, "Archer got away."
- Oh, that son of a...

16:37.677 --> 16:39.446
As did the Vandertunt Broad.

16:39.447 --> 16:41.015
What? How could you
let that happen?

16:41.051 --> 16:42.514
There were five of 'em!

16:42.610 --> 16:45.585
And I had to check my gun,
obviously, so I...

16:46.116 --> 16:47.584
See you didn't check yours.

16:47.586 --> 16:50.355
No. No, there was
so much confusion.

16:50.356 --> 16:51.523
Yeah, right?

16:51.524 --> 16:53.124
Right. For instance,
I'm confused

16:53.125 --> 16:54.895
about why I don't just go ahead

16:54.896 --> 16:56.964
and shoot you in
your stupid fat face.

16:56.965 --> 17:00.832
Well, for one thing...
Noooo!

17:00.833 --> 17:03.633
Okay, you dummy.
So tonight, right now,

17:03.636 --> 17:05.205
you're gonna find
the Vandertunt Broad,

17:05.207 --> 17:06.604
and you're gonna find Archer.

17:06.605 --> 17:08.105
You're gonna bring her
to Trexler's,

17:08.107 --> 17:09.941
and you're gonna
leave him in some alley

17:09.942 --> 17:11.771
With a case of lead poisoning,
just like his partner.

17:11.777 --> 17:13.777
You got it?
Mawp. Mawp.

17:13.779 --> 17:16.809
That better have been
a long-ass apology.

17:16.816 --> 17:19.184
Mother:
I'm sorry, what was that?

17:19.185 --> 17:21.152
No, just, if I had more time,

17:21.153 --> 17:22.723
I... I could really
tighten up my set.

17:22.723 --> 17:24.452
Oh, I don't know
how you'd improve

17:24.457 --> 17:26.627
on a solid half-hour
about Syphilis.

17:26.627 --> 17:27.559
- Wait. What?
- Ew!

17:27.631 --> 17:30.360
What I do know
is all the refunds I gave

17:30.363 --> 17:32.163
are coming out of your paycheck.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.232
- But...
- You've got a "But"?

17:34.233 --> 17:35.863
- I'll say.
- Zip it, Missy.

17:35.919 --> 17:37.968
And, come to think of it,
the refunds will come

17:37.974 --> 17:39.630
out of all your paychecks!

17:39.679 --> 17:41.339
- Damn it, Ray!
- That's some bullshit.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.700
And I swear to God,
if you people get caught

17:43.709 --> 17:47.439
- smoking reefers again...
- I'm sorry. By "you people," do you mean...

17:47.499 --> 17:50.014
Out! All of you, out!

17:50.681 --> 17:51.915
Not so fast, shamus.

17:51.995 --> 17:53.985
Damn it.

17:53.986 --> 17:56.886
Hey, not that it should matter,
but I was a Tanker.

17:56.889 --> 17:58.719
761st Tank Battalion.

17:58.752 --> 18:00.492
Wait. Patton's Panthers?

18:00.493 --> 18:02.693
You guys saved
our asses at the bulge.

18:02.695 --> 18:05.535
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, now I feel like an asshole.

18:05.536 --> 18:08.231
Well, can't help you with that.

18:08.234 --> 18:10.874
Mother: Archer! And that little
chippie of yours.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.030
I beg your pardon?

18:13.038 --> 18:15.268
- Keep it up, and you will.
- Wait. What?

18:15.274 --> 18:17.074
I'm not accustomed
to being stood up,

18:17.076 --> 18:18.814
Mr. Archer,
and yet once again...

18:18.896 --> 18:21.241
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just...

18:21.247 --> 18:23.185
Well, she isn't
just some chippie.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.552
She's actually
Charlotte Vandertunt.

18:25.553 --> 18:28.051
I... you mean, the heiress

18:28.053 --> 18:31.053
to the vast Vandertunt
Publishing Fortune?

18:31.056 --> 18:32.456
- Uh, duh.
- Zerp.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.258
Then do tell.
What's a nice heiress like you

18:35.261 --> 18:37.791
- doing in a joint like this?
- I rescued her.

18:37.797 --> 18:41.067
Len Trexler and that Cop Figgis
were gonna kidnap her, so...

18:41.068 --> 18:43.234
How were they going to do that?

18:43.239 --> 18:45.235
Well, nobody knows
where she is, so...

18:45.237 --> 18:47.877
I'm trying to escape a
quasi-incestuous

18:47.878 --> 18:49.103
family situation.

18:49.108 --> 18:50.268
- How?
- A four.

18:50.276 --> 18:51.910
Eh.
Yeah, so...

18:51.911 --> 18:54.611
So, presumably,
the Vandertunt family

18:54.613 --> 18:56.513
still doesn't know where she is?

18:56.515 --> 18:58.955
I mean, don't know
how they would.

19:00.251 --> 19:01.651
Excellent.

19:01.654 --> 19:05.490
- Oh, shit.
- What?

19:05.491 --> 19:07.791
Mother: Well, then, I suggest
you wake him.

19:07.793 --> 19:09.393
Unless you think Mr. Vandertunt

19:09.395 --> 19:11.765
would rather see
his daughter gradually...

19:12.564 --> 19:14.064
Via the mail.

19:18.270 --> 19:20.900
Best... day... ever!

19:22.641 --> 19:23.901
Right?
