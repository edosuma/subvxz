Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"The Return of Quaid"</font>

00:43.384 --> 00:46.490
Alright, Cass,
here's the last of the water.

00:46.577 --> 00:49.954
Just a few more supplies,
and we are ready to roll.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.421
Looking good, Max!

00:51.509 --> 00:54.477
You know, Blondie, this might
not be the glamorous city

00:54.564 --> 00:55.573
it used to be...

00:55.660 --> 00:56.837
Don't step there.
Or there.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.753
You should really
put shoes on. Honestly.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.691
But part of me is actually
going to miss

01:00.778 --> 01:02.821
my old stomping grounds.

01:02.908 --> 01:03.856
Huh?

01:03.943 --> 01:05.881
Hello?
Rapunzel?

Advertise your product or brand here

01:15.266 --> 01:17.481
And what are you
starin' at!

01:17.568 --> 01:20.214
I dunno,
but it ain't much, ya clod!

01:23.799 --> 01:25.419
Huh? Oh!

01:27.817 --> 01:29.628
Stop, thief!

01:29.715 --> 01:32.996
This place is...
it's so sad.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.930
Yeah, but, maybe now that we've
run the Baron out of town,

01:35.998 --> 01:38.039
this old city will turn itself
around.

01:40.343 --> 01:43.323
Ladies and gentlemen of Vardaros!

01:44.306 --> 01:45.746
Or, this could happen.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.020
You may have noticed that

01:47.107 --> 01:49.090
the sudden departure
of our beloved Baron

01:49.177 --> 01:52.550
has left a conspicuous vacancy
in this city's management.

01:52.685 --> 01:54.627
Well, good news...

01:54.714 --> 01:56.900
The position has been filled!

01:56.987 --> 01:59.812
- Is that Weasel?
- Weasel. The Baron's right hand man.

01:59.899 --> 02:01.853
With that
sadistic egomaniac in charge,

02:01.940 --> 02:04.781
you can bet things are about to
get a lot uglier around here.

02:04.868 --> 02:07.017
I got plans for my city.

02:07.104 --> 02:09.812
In a word: Expansion.

02:10.008 --> 02:14.994
Any neighboring field, forest,
or fjord now belongs to me.

02:15.081 --> 02:19.046
And, people, growth like
that requires capital.

02:19.133 --> 02:22.579
So,
I've come to collect.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.096
Hey!

02:27.838 --> 02:30.148
Alright, Raps, I know you see
people in trouble,

02:30.235 --> 02:31.872
but this isn't our fight.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.735
Don't do anything...

02:33.934 --> 02:35.939
Ugh. Drastic.

02:36.026 --> 02:39.962
Hey! Weasel!
Leave the people of Vardaros alone!

02:40.049 --> 02:41.475
Ah. Princess,

02:41.562 --> 02:43.063
still in town?

02:43.162 --> 02:45.235
Let me see you out.

02:47.109 --> 02:48.445
Oh! Ugh!

02:50.475 --> 02:51.461
C'mon...

02:51.548 --> 02:53.690
You don't mind if we stick
around for a little bit,

02:53.777 --> 02:54.808
do you?

03:03.180 --> 03:04.219
Hoo!

03:05.216 --> 03:06.352
Yah!

03:14.428 --> 03:16.833
You fancy
you're helping these people,

03:16.920 --> 03:18.731
don't you, princess?

03:18.818 --> 03:20.809
They know I'll be back.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.541
Only now,
I'll bring extra muscle.

03:23.628 --> 03:25.138
In four days' time,

03:25.225 --> 03:28.496
we'll be taking it all,
thanks to you!

03:30.448 --> 03:34.434
- Thanks a lot, Princess!
- Yeah, beat it, ya clod!

03:34.521 --> 03:36.293
You're not wanted here!

03:36.443 --> 03:39.407
Pfft! Vardaros
is no place for heroes.

03:46.687 --> 03:48.611
Look, I'm all for
helping the little guy,

03:48.698 --> 03:50.737
but say we fight Weasel
when he gets back,

03:50.824 --> 03:52.954
we can't stay here,
and beat him up forever.

03:53.041 --> 03:56.216
Though, pummeling that guy
is kind of satisfying,

03:56.303 --> 03:57.682
Eugene is right.

03:57.769 --> 03:59.501
Yeah,
you can't help someone

03:59.588 --> 04:00.845
who doesn't want
to help themselves.

04:00.932 --> 04:03.801
Take it from a guy who is
a pro at helping himself.

04:03.888 --> 04:05.574
Don't mind if I do.

04:09.077 --> 04:11.004
You know,
I keep hearing

04:11.091 --> 04:13.082
how great
this city used to be.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.527
Well,
greatness does not go away.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.051
It may get beaten down,

04:18.137 --> 04:20.480
or... hide itself from
fear or doubt,

04:20.567 --> 04:22.494
but it does not go away.

04:22.581 --> 04:24.833
You, of all people,
should know

04:24.920 --> 04:26.801
that sometimes,
all that's needed

04:26.888 --> 04:28.861
to get the best of what's
inside of you,

04:28.948 --> 04:30.698
is a little help.

04:31.171 --> 04:34.020
So, I say,
we go out there,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.163
go door to door,
if we have to,

04:36.250 --> 04:39.363
and... rally these people
to take a stand.

04:39.450 --> 04:43.330
Because if we can inspire one person,
just one person,

04:43.417 --> 04:47.602
- then the battle is half won!
- Yeah!

04:49.013 --> 04:52.586
I can't believe we couldn't
inspire one person.

04:52.673 --> 04:53.892
Oh, I don't know.

04:53.979 --> 04:57.987
That lovely young lady
handing out fish seemed inspired.

04:58.736 --> 05:00.002
That was a seagull.

05:00.089 --> 05:02.986
No, I'm pretty sure
that was a rainbow trout.

05:03.073 --> 05:05.723
I don't get it!
Why won't these people

05:05.810 --> 05:06.996
let me help them?

05:07.083 --> 05:08.751
Because
you're an outsider.

05:08.838 --> 05:12.673
Also, you're a naive princess
who insists the glass is half full,

05:12.760 --> 05:15.019
even when
it's obviously bone dry.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.298
That's a really annoying trait.
Especially here.

05:18.385 --> 05:21.097
You're basically everything
people in this city despise.

05:21.897 --> 05:24.799
You could've stopped at outsider,
but OK, get it.

05:24.886 --> 05:26.628
The people need someone
they trust.

05:26.715 --> 05:27.915
Someone who can offer

05:28.002 --> 05:29.223
a long-term solution.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.511
Someone
they look up to...

05:41.369 --> 05:42.888
Captain Quaid.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.476
He was sheriff of Vardaros
back in the day.

05:45.563 --> 05:48.591
And he was the first guy
to ever arrest us.

05:48.678 --> 05:50.702
And the second. And the third.

05:51.527 --> 05:53.806
In a way, he was family.

05:54.453 --> 05:57.096
<i>Captain Quaid the
Blade, we called him.</i>

05:57.183 --> 05:59.040
<i>He was known for his cunning,</i>

05:59.127 --> 06:00.684
<i>strength,</i>

06:00.771 --> 06:01.835
<i>and bravery!</i>

06:01.922 --> 06:04.383
<i>But, above all else,
he was proud of his city.</i>

06:04.470 --> 06:05.961
<i>His pride was infectious.</i>

06:06.048 --> 06:07.292
<i>People loved Quaid,</i>

06:07.379 --> 06:08.531
<i>and they loved Vardaros.</i>

06:08.618 --> 06:09.630
<i>What happened to him?</i>

06:09.717 --> 06:10.770
<i>He quit.</i>

06:10.857 --> 06:12.897
Or, at least,
that's what I was told.

06:12.984 --> 06:14.168
It was before my time,

06:14.255 --> 06:16.070
but the few people
who are still here

06:16.157 --> 06:19.048
from the glory days,
say he met his match.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.890
No one hears much from him
anymore.

06:20.977 --> 06:22.828
Do you know
where we could find him?

06:22.915 --> 06:25.765
I do.
But it's gonna cost ya.

06:28.495 --> 06:31.245
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get
ahead of this one here...

06:31.332 --> 06:33.486
You wanna find
a way-past-his-prime lawman,

06:33.573 --> 06:35.909
somehow convince him
to come out of retirement,

06:35.996 --> 06:38.468
and inspire these poor people
to fight back against Weasel,

06:38.555 --> 06:40.954
and/or any other lowlife
who tries to claw their way

06:41.041 --> 06:42.355
into power
in this flea-bitten city?

06:42.442 --> 06:44.432
And you wanna do this all
in four days?

06:44.519 --> 06:46.079
Do you think it'll work?

06:46.380 --> 06:48.027
If we say not in a million years,

06:48.114 --> 06:49.415
would it change your mind?

06:50.673 --> 06:51.822
Probably not.

06:51.909 --> 06:52.865
Well, then.

06:52.952 --> 06:54.899
Let's go find us a sheriff!

07:02.356 --> 07:04.418
I know it's crazy, Pascal,

07:04.505 --> 07:06.079
but if Quaid is
even half the

07:06.166 --> 07:08.589
inspiration
Lance and Eugene say he is,

07:08.676 --> 07:12.260
Vardaros could be on its way
back to greatness.

07:12.509 --> 07:15.284
Alright! We're here!

07:17.219 --> 07:18.671
Captain Quaid?

07:18.758 --> 07:20.127
Who's asking?

07:20.214 --> 07:22.354
It's Rapunzel.

07:23.353 --> 07:25.401
Told you everyone hates you.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.938
Uh, Captain Quaid?

07:30.883 --> 07:34.081
If you don't open this door,
I will, uh...

07:34.168 --> 07:36.236
I'm just gonna keep knocking.

07:36.910 --> 07:38.433
And knocking!

07:39.012 --> 07:40.082
Ow!

07:40.193 --> 07:42.460
And when my knuckles start
to hurt,

07:42.547 --> 07:44.854
I'm just gonna knock
with my other hand!

07:44.941 --> 07:49.330
You do not want to test the
commitment of these knuckles, Mister.

07:51.571 --> 07:52.926
Hi!

07:54.714 --> 07:55.990
Three minutes.

07:56.077 --> 07:58.330
Not a grain more.

08:00.488 --> 08:03.705
Hey-ya! Quaid! Remember us?
The "not guilty twins?"

08:03.990 --> 08:06.034
You degenerates
stay out here.

08:06.121 --> 08:08.860
Touch, look at,
or breathe on anything,

08:08.947 --> 08:10.942
I'll get you
where you sleep.

08:11.029 --> 08:12.682
That clear?

08:12.782 --> 08:16.096
- Ah, family.
- There's nothing like it.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.416
Okay, so here's my idea.

08:19.503 --> 08:23.167
The people of Vardaros
need Quaid the Blade

08:23.254 --> 08:25.221
to stand up against Weasel.

08:25.308 --> 08:26.666
Ha! Believe me,

08:26.753 --> 08:30.096
the people of Vardaros
need a lot more than that.

08:30.183 --> 08:31.338
What's this?

08:31.425 --> 08:33.249
Funny you should ask.

08:34.256 --> 08:36.506
Best honey in Vardaros.

08:36.644 --> 08:40.135
My friends here work like
a single, well-oiled machine.

08:40.222 --> 08:43.126
Together, they gather
all sorts of varietals.

08:43.212 --> 08:44.839
We make buckwheat honey,

08:44.926 --> 08:47.437
orange blossom honey, kudzu honey...

08:48.504 --> 08:49.752
Oops!

08:49.958 --> 08:53.028
Looks like he just got
a face full of pheromones.

08:53.190 --> 08:54.412
What are those?

08:54.499 --> 08:57.124
It's like a love potion
for bees.

08:57.211 --> 09:00.255
They think they got
themselves a new queen.

09:03.267 --> 09:07.997
Listen,
Vardaros' heyday is long gone.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.950
And now, so's your sand.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.748
Weasel's gonna expand,
you know.

09:17.835 --> 09:21.641
Every nearby forest, field,
and fjord will belong to him.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.850
Do you know what that means?

09:22.937 --> 09:23.873
It means,

09:23.960 --> 09:25.655
I'm gonna have to get
myself a dictionary

09:25.742 --> 09:27.296
to look up
what a fjord is.

09:27.383 --> 09:29.451
It means
you can say goodbye

09:29.538 --> 09:33.466
to the fields of buckwheat,
kudzu, and orange blossom.

09:34.430 --> 09:37.655
If I was gonna stand up
to this Weasel,

09:37.742 --> 09:39.224
I'm awful rusty.

09:39.311 --> 09:41.670
Don't worry.
We'll help you.

09:55.439 --> 09:57.953
Alright. Let's start easy.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.216
Ooh, so close!

10:08.941 --> 10:12.294
Alright, Quaid the Blade,
let's go.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.752
My yam!

10:26.849 --> 10:28.119
Yeesh!

10:29.315 --> 10:31.660
This was a mistake.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.215
Captain?
You're not leaving, are you?

10:37.302 --> 10:39.183
Weasel can have this place.

10:39.270 --> 10:41.028
We'll find another field.

10:41.115 --> 10:44.415
So, you're a little
out of practice...

10:44.502 --> 10:45.458
A little?

10:45.545 --> 10:47.534
Vardaros doesn't need
a warrior,

10:47.621 --> 10:50.548
they need a symbol, Captain.
The people are...

10:50.635 --> 10:52.806
Stop with the people,
already!

10:52.893 --> 10:55.017
The people are the reason

10:55.104 --> 10:57.797
I gave up on this city
in the first place!

10:59.825 --> 11:01.641
It all began with

11:01.860 --> 11:03.753
<i>the Collector.</i>

11:03.840 --> 11:05.645
<i>He was a sword-for-hire.</i>

11:05.732 --> 11:09.144
<i>The Baron employed him when he first
started to take over Vardaros.</i>

11:09.231 --> 11:11.067
<i>Real bad guy.</i>

11:11.154 --> 11:13.844
<i>I tried to take him in,
and, well,</i>

11:13.979 --> 11:15.952
<i>let's just say,
that didn't work out.</i>

11:16.039 --> 11:17.010
<i>Oh.</i>

11:17.105 --> 11:19.327
So, he's how
you met your match.

11:19.414 --> 11:20.826
<i>The Collector? Nah.</i>

11:20.913 --> 11:23.482
<i>At the end of the day,
he's just another bad guy.</i>

11:23.569 --> 11:26.841
<i>I met my match when
I tried to get the people</i>

11:26.928 --> 11:29.717
<i>to fight back against
the Baron and his men,</i>

11:29.804 --> 11:32.356
but they just
gave up.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.529
If we'd stuck together,
like my friends here,

11:36.616 --> 11:38.849
we woulda stood a chance
against the Collector,

11:38.936 --> 11:41.020
against the Baron,
against anyone.

11:41.107 --> 11:44.692
But they lost faith
in Vardaros.

11:45.868 --> 11:49.185
The look on little Vex's face
reminded me that it would take

11:49.272 --> 11:53.130
a lot more than training
to bring that back.

11:54.973 --> 11:56.102
So, Princess,

11:56.189 --> 11:57.732
just so we're all clear here,

11:57.819 --> 12:00.715
the guy you chose
to re-inspire the people,

12:00.802 --> 12:03.688
needs to be re-inspired himself.

12:03.775 --> 12:05.873
We just need
to get the ball rolling.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.535
And,
how do you plan to do that?

12:08.622 --> 12:10.692
I'm not. You are.

12:16.281 --> 12:17.839
So, what's the plan, Blondie?

12:17.926 --> 12:21.449
Uh, Lance,
how is your acting?

12:21.536 --> 12:23.059
My acting!?

12:23.267 --> 12:26.660
You are looking at the star
of Vardaros' own,

12:26.747 --> 12:28.622
"A Walk in the Bushes!"

12:31.226 --> 12:32.700
I was the bush.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.208
Please tell me
you have a backup plan.

12:37.926 --> 12:39.183
What we doing here?

12:39.270 --> 12:40.592
Upholding my promise

12:40.679 --> 12:42.354
to the people of Vardaros.

12:42.441 --> 12:44.918
I said I'd be back with
extra muscle,

12:45.005 --> 12:48.395
And he will more than suffice.

12:48.482 --> 12:49.889
You knock.

12:57.639 --> 13:00.145
I have a job for you...

13:04.128 --> 13:05.577
Help!

13:05.719 --> 13:09.779
I'm in Mortimer peril!
Someone do something!

13:09.866 --> 13:11.678
Stand and deliver!

13:11.765 --> 13:13.138
I am standing.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.286
Okay, Vex, you're up.

13:15.417 --> 13:20.780
Give me thine coin purse!
Oh, bearded homunculus!

13:20.867 --> 13:24.269
Oh no!
A holdup! In broad daylight?

13:24.356 --> 13:25.718
What can we do?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.353
Oh, look! Captain Quaid!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.574
Thank goodness you
just happen to be here!

13:29.661 --> 13:32.178
Oh! Ha ha.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.014
Thou thinkest thou
can defeat me?

13:35.101 --> 13:37.020
'Tis to laugh!

13:38.854 --> 13:41.497
I mean, honestly, he wasn't
any better as the bush.

13:52.180 --> 13:54.655
Hey everyone! Look at this!

13:54.834 --> 13:57.593
Oh, disarmed!

13:57.882 --> 14:00.004
Oh, the ignominy!

14:00.091 --> 14:03.556
Quaid hath returned like
a tempest of justice

14:03.643 --> 14:06.639
that rain upon
the parched earth of crime!

14:06.990 --> 14:09.421
Let's make some noise
for Quaid!

14:09.528 --> 14:11.640
Quaid! Quaid! Quaid!

14:11.727 --> 14:14.961
You saved me!
My life flashed before my eyes.

14:15.048 --> 14:17.686
Did you know
I used to be a doctor?

14:19.716 --> 14:23.766
Ha! Told you, Quaid just
needed a little push.

14:23.853 --> 14:27.335
Now watch:
hope is contagious.

14:32.057 --> 14:33.155
Huh?

14:33.242 --> 14:35.063
Hey, give that back!

14:36.651 --> 14:38.331
Oof!

15:36.985 --> 15:38.493
Kitty!

15:48.510 --> 15:49.682
Yay!

16:00.759 --> 16:02.194
Ah, to Quaid!

16:02.281 --> 16:05.163
- To Quaid! - To Quaid!
- Yeah! - Yeah!

16:05.257 --> 16:07.541
Oh! I almost forgot.

16:07.628 --> 16:09.405
I made you something.

16:10.529 --> 16:14.551
I couldn't help but notice your
old one had seen better days.

16:14.751 --> 16:17.171
Suppose you're gonna
throw this thing out?

16:17.324 --> 16:21.572
Well, it occurs to me,
that every respectable sheriff

16:21.659 --> 16:23.241
needs a deputy.

16:25.069 --> 16:27.607
Oh! Yeah, uh huh.
Okay. Whatever.

16:27.694 --> 16:30.008
To a new Vardaros!

16:30.095 --> 16:31.620
Vardaros!

16:31.825 --> 16:35.416
I'm pretty sure
that was bee pheromones.

16:36.255 --> 16:39.513
Why is this just sitting
here in a drinking glass!?

16:53.638 --> 16:55.267
That cloak...

16:55.354 --> 16:59.043
It's the same one that
blasted crook in the town wore.

16:59.130 --> 17:01.428
No, no, this isn't a cloak!
It's a towel.

17:01.515 --> 17:04.272
I...
I was going swimming later.

17:05.653 --> 17:07.851
Vex, did you...

17:09.588 --> 17:11.969
You never believed, did you?

17:12.056 --> 17:13.906
Captain,
it's not what it looks like!

17:13.993 --> 17:15.876
You staged the whole thing.

17:15.963 --> 17:18.017
I guess it is
what it looks like.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.625
I think you all best leave.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.671
Sorry, Captain.
I just thought that you...

17:24.758 --> 17:25.678
Now!

17:25.765 --> 17:27.599
You said that
you gave up on this city

17:27.686 --> 17:29.835
because no one wanted
to fight for Vardaros.

17:29.922 --> 17:34.434
Well, you just made a deputy.
And she's ready to fight!

17:34.869 --> 17:37.039
Are you gonna let her fight alone?

17:39.438 --> 17:41.014
Sorry, Blondie.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.062
I don't think he's coming out.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.771
I can't believe I'm doing this.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.446
I feel like an idiot.

17:59.533 --> 18:03.373
Yeah, kid, becoming one of
the good guys will do that.

18:07.342 --> 18:08.515
Hmm?

18:17.081 --> 18:18.444
Well, well!

18:18.531 --> 18:21.590
The princess and her playgroup
are still here.

18:21.677 --> 18:24.485
And it looks like there's
a new sheriff in town.

18:24.572 --> 18:26.397
I'm a deputy, jerk!

18:26.484 --> 18:28.647
Alright then, Deputy.

18:28.734 --> 18:31.930
Allow me to introduce you
to a special guest.

18:32.017 --> 18:33.567
He is the most deadly,

18:33.654 --> 18:34.858
the most fearsome,

18:34.945 --> 18:36.973
and, quite possibly,
the nastiest

18:37.060 --> 18:39.185
bounty hunter
money can buy...

18:39.364 --> 18:41.208
The Collector!

18:48.702 --> 18:52.201
Come on, people!
Don't be scared!

18:52.288 --> 18:54.257
I've heard the stories
about this guy too,

18:54.344 --> 18:56.505
but how bad can he really be?

18:59.125 --> 19:03.063
There I go,
speaking too soon again!

19:03.909 --> 19:07.077
Seeing as how I went through
the trouble of hiring him,

19:07.164 --> 19:09.453
I'd hate
to lose my deposit.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.999
If you think
I'm backing down,

19:12.086 --> 19:13.429
you are...

19:13.851 --> 19:15.046
Rapunzel!

19:24.546 --> 19:25.578
Oh!

19:25.665 --> 19:27.155
Collect this!

19:42.281 --> 19:44.032
Ah! Oh!

19:50.089 --> 19:53.147
So much for Vardaros's new sheriff.

19:53.632 --> 19:56.577
Weren't you listening,
you filthy crook?

19:56.724 --> 19:58.934
She said she was a deputy.

20:00.922 --> 20:04.858
And I'm the sheriff.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.688
Quaid the Blade!

20:08.775 --> 20:10.466
How perfect is this?

20:10.553 --> 20:13.359
The Collector crushed you
in your prime.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.709
What makes you think
you can defeat him now?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.594
I can't...

20:21.755 --> 20:23.544
But, we can!

20:46.561 --> 20:47.979
Come on, people!

20:48.066 --> 20:49.258
Enough hiding!

20:49.345 --> 20:50.828
- This is our city!
- Huh?

20:50.915 --> 20:53.472
Together,
we can take back our home!

20:53.559 --> 20:54.599
You heard her.

20:54.686 --> 20:57.711
Let's show 'em Vardaros
doesn't belong to them...

20:57.798 --> 20:59.183
anymore!

21:03.061 --> 21:04.183
Oof!

21:12.938 --> 21:14.219
Ah!

21:39.877 --> 21:41.114
Well, what do you know?

21:41.201 --> 21:45.518
These people can smile
after all. It's kinda nice.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.430
Those are smiles, right?

21:51.803 --> 21:53.465
<i>I have a feeling that beneath</i>

21:53.552 --> 21:55.482
