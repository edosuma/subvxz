08:15.628 --> 08:16.662
I'm Andrea.

08:16.729 --> 08:17.697
Oh, it's Sandy.

08:17.763 --> 08:19.165
Really?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.367
Oh, yeah, it's terrible,
just call me Shorts Guy.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.569
You know what, that's actually
what I wanted to talk
to you about.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.705
I was thinking-- and I'm sure
you would agree with me--

08:25.771 --> 08:30.343
that maybe we have... run
the shorts bit into the ground.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.746
Oh, uh, I thought
that was sort of our thing.

08:33.813 --> 08:37.416
Oh... it has been our thing,
and it's been fun.

08:37.483 --> 08:39.685
I just was thinking,
you know, to be honest,

08:39.752 --> 08:42.221
one grownup to another...

08:42.288 --> 08:45.925
It was starting
to just get to be a lot.

08:45.992 --> 08:49.395
Is it really that hard
to say "shorts"?

08:49.462 --> 08:52.899
It felt hard?

08:52.965 --> 08:56.335
But now... less so.

09:06.312 --> 09:10.049
That's actually
my Uber, um...

09:10.116 --> 09:12.084
Not great timing,
I apologize.

09:12.151 --> 09:16.255
Anyway, Sandy,
so nice to meet you,

09:16.322 --> 09:18.190
officially, and,
you know what?

09:18.257 --> 09:23.996
We'll continue this and,
um, have a great night and--

09:24.063 --> 09:25.164
whatever you're doing.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.834
I'm going to Baskin-Robbins.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.670
I love ice cream.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.175
Again, I'm, I'm...

09:36.242 --> 09:37.576
You're great-- bye!

09:41.914 --> 09:43.149
when I'm on
the NextDoor website.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.150
Yo!

09:43.215 --> 09:44.150
There we go.

09:44.216 --> 09:47.086
I am obsessed with NextDoor.

09:44.216 --> 09:47.086
Three.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.788
That's good, all right,
I'll take that.

09:48.854 --> 09:51.257
It's like everybody
on there is missing a dog.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.392
I'm convinced there's
a dog serial killer

09:53.459 --> 09:54.860
in my neighborhood.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.763
My NextDoor is all
"Mysterious Men in Hoodies".

09:57.830 --> 09:59.899
Oh, yeah, on mine there
was poor, sad woman

09:59.966 --> 10:02.234
who was looking for a
gynecologist recommendation.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.736
No!

10:03.803 --> 10:05.571
Yeah, she literally had
no one to talk to

10:05.638 --> 10:06.639
except an open
neighborhood forum.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.441
Save that shit for Yelp.

10:08.507 --> 10:11.243
Uh, I, I have to say--

10:08.507 --> 10:11.243
I found my gynecologist
on Trip Advisor.

10:11.310 --> 10:15.715
Last night I reached out to my
neighbor, Rose L., in need,

10:15.781 --> 10:18.451
and let her know
that I was recommending

10:18.517 --> 10:20.052
my gynecologist,
Dr. Sapkin.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.954
Ugh.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.954
You're pronouncing that wrong.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.255
I think it's...
[whining] "Sap-kin".

10:23.322 --> 10:26.325
Dr. Sapkin,
I have a discharge.

10:26.392 --> 10:30.062
The a problem with your
vulva is a distension.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.831
None of you know
Dr. Sapkin.

10:31.897 --> 10:33.132
Dr. Sapkin?

10:31.897 --> 10:33.132
Poor Dr. Sapkin.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.301
Dr. Sapkin has
a very sensual touch.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.670
Oh, really?

10:35.368 --> 10:37.670
You can't even tell if
Dr. Sapkin is wearing gloves.

10:37.737 --> 10:38.738
That's not a good sign.

10:37.737 --> 10:38.738
That's-- yeah!

10:38.804 --> 10:39.805
I got two!

10:38.804 --> 10:39.805
Two!

10:39.872 --> 10:41.173
Whoo!

10:39.872 --> 10:41.173
Whoa!

10:41.240 --> 10:42.908
That's 12,
that's the highest.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.610
That means Corinne,
you get to dare him.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.812
Okay, yeah, oh, shit...

10:44.677 --> 10:46.812
Come on.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.614
I'm not good at
thinking of good dares.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.049
I got-- do you mind?
I have one.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.018
Okay.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.018
All right, Kyle...

10:52.084 --> 10:53.686
you can keep
your underwear on--

10:53.753 --> 10:56.689
let me rephrase that-- you have
to keep your underwear on.

10:56.756 --> 11:00.559
You gotta put on Corinne's
tights and then pull them up

11:00.626 --> 11:03.362
as high as you can-- take your
top off, go in the other room,

11:03.429 --> 11:06.399
come back, give all of us
heartfelt compliments.

11:06.465 --> 11:07.767
Oh, that's a nice one.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.102
I feel like this is
more like a dare for me.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.271
Quality time in the other room
will be exciting.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.373
Am I allowed to sniff them
before I put them on?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.175
Yes, that's part of the dare.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.175
Cool.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.577
And then you have to guess
what she had for breakfast.

11:18.644 --> 11:19.812
You see, this is
what we miss.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.347
We miss this
unadulterated vulgarity

11:21.414 --> 11:22.748
when you're not around.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.651
Well, then why did you ass-cocks
stop inviting me to stuff?

11:25.718 --> 11:27.953
Uh, because you're
a mom, you got babies

11:28.020 --> 11:29.422
and you gotta change
diapers, right?

11:29.488 --> 11:30.990
My child is five.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.591
Wow, you have an old baby.

11:32.658 --> 11:35.761
Old baby? And by the way,
just because I have a baby,

11:35.828 --> 11:37.496
it's not a disease, okay?

11:37.563 --> 11:39.999
I mean, yes, obviously
I have genital herpes,

11:40.066 --> 11:42.735
but that is not gonna
keep me from events

11:42.802 --> 11:44.904
like celebrating Lon
getting closer to death.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.739
Well, we are gonna
go to Vegas next week

11:46.806 --> 11:49.875
and see Beatles' "Love" for the
tenth time-- do you wanna come?

11:49.942 --> 11:51.377
It's better every time.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.377
Bring your herpes.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.846
You guys, that's where
my herpes was born.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.681
Ohh...

11:55.748 --> 11:58.150
And to see what a beautiful
herpes it's grown up to become.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.453
Oh, my... you saw this?

12:00.519 --> 12:01.787
I could say I don't
even notice it.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.255
Just invite me to shit.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.224
I'll add you to the text chain.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.224
Thank you.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.327
Oh, here we go.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.327
[laughing]

12:08.394 --> 12:11.230
By the way,
I'm a little aroused.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.199
Now, for some compliments.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.199
All right.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.635
Todd, fella, you always bring
a smile to everyone's face.

12:16.702 --> 12:21.740
Corinne, your hair looks done,
but not over-done or too done.

12:21.807 --> 12:22.842
You look beautiful.

12:21.807 --> 12:22.842
Thank you.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.677
Lon, you smell so nice.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.879
Sometimes when I get home my
shirts still smell like you

12:26.946 --> 12:27.880
and it makes me happy.

12:26.946 --> 12:27.880
Sandalwood.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.248
Nice.

12:29.315 --> 12:32.184
Andrea... Andrea,
you're a monster,

12:32.251 --> 12:34.186
a horrible,
horrible monster,

12:34.253 --> 12:35.721
and I mean that
from the bottom of my heart.

12:35.788 --> 12:39.091
The heart behind that
sort of exposed areola?

12:39.158 --> 12:41.193
No, the heart that is
my butthole.

demo tape, it's, it's all right.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.036
Great, thanks, this is me.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.039
Well, thank you so much.
Have a great night.

[metallic clatter to ground]

12:54.106 --> 12:55.407
Oh, shit.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.543
Are you okay?

12:55.474 --> 12:57.543
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh,

12:57.610 --> 12:59.278
I think I just...

12:59.345 --> 13:00.746
I think I just
dropped something.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.648
I don't think it's
anything important.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.917
You know what, I think it was
just a lipstick, I'm good.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.520
It sounded like a key.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.756
You know what, it, it act-- it
did sound a little like a key.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.125
Um, either way, my husband,
you know what,

13:13.192 --> 13:14.760
he's home,
so he'll let me in.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.195
So I'm all good, thanks.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.830
Do you think your
husband's up this late?

13:17.897 --> 13:21.700
Uh, if he's not up, then my son,
Alan, will definitely be up.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.437
He's an archer,
he's in archery and...

13:25.504 --> 13:28.541
Archery?

13:25.504 --> 13:28.541
You know, evidently he can shoot
pretty far, like 200 meters.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.075
People say he should be
a sniper,

13:30.142 --> 13:31.544
but it's not even like...

13:31.610 --> 13:33.979
not the world I want
my son to live in, but um,

13:34.046 --> 13:35.080
you know what,
thank you so much,

13:35.147 --> 13:36.815
I had such a good night.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.918
You're welcome.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.918
And good luck with
all the music stuff.

You're great.

it's not taking it.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.757
Okay, we can help you with that.
I just need your password.

14:18.824 --> 14:23.128
Shit! Um, I mean, the password
obviously is not "shit".

14:23.195 --> 14:27.866
It's um, oh, it's my mom's

Uh, so, I was getting
out of my Uber tonight

15:31.096 --> 15:34.433
and I may have accidentally
dropped my key in his backseat,

15:34.500 --> 15:36.001

to worry about, right?

You 100% need to worry--
you are about to be murdered.

First of all, he doesn't know

15:50.649 --> 15:52.251

Because I did a whole thing

was home and my grown son,

into archery.

on the ground or something.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.009
Oh, my God,
what are you doing?

16:17.076 --> 16:18.510
You're just there
presenting yourself.

16:18.577 --> 16:19.978
This is not funny, Kyle,

16:20.045 --> 16:22.348
I'm actually really
freaked out right now.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.950
I left my key
in a stranger's car.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.453
Fine, if you want,
I can come over there

16:27.519 --> 16:29.054
to help you avoid
getting murdered.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.423
Yes, please, that would be
very nice, thank you.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.125
Who's getting murdered?

16:33.192 --> 16:35.394
[grunts]
My friend Andrea.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.364
Are you with a girl?

16:35.461 --> 16:38.364
<i>Uh, yeah, why?</i>

16:38.430 --> 16:40.299
Oh, my God, Kyle,
that is so rude!

16:40.366 --> 16:42.935
Why would you pick up the phone
if you're there with a girl?

16:43.001 --> 16:45.938
No, I mean, we were done...
first round.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.107
You're not leaving
your date there alone, Kyle.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.109
She took an Uber, so I can
get her an Uber back.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.245
Hey, maybe your key will be in
the Uber, wouldn't that be cool?

16:53.312 --> 16:54.313
That's a movie.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.848
<i>Okay, she's hungry.</i>

16:55.914 --> 16:57.750
We're gonna go get
some late night grub,

16:57.816 --> 16:59.485
if you know what I mean.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.353
Yes, I know what you mean
because you've said it clearly,

17:01.420 --> 17:02.888
it's not a double entendre.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.224
If you need anything,
I'm here, though, okay?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.192
Bye.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.461
[dog barking]

17:24.710 --> 17:28.180
Dear NextDoor
Valley Glen, comma.

17:28.247 --> 17:32.284
It's four A, period, M, period,
and I am very scared

17:32.351 --> 17:36.488
to be alone in my house,
exclamation mark.

17:36.555 --> 17:40.259
I left my housekey in the back
of an Uber driven by Rob

17:40.325 --> 17:43.562
in a Toyota Tercel, comma.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.465
I just want someone
to know what has happened

17:46.532 --> 17:50.102
in case I do not make it
through the night,

17:50.169 --> 17:55.007
ellipsis, exclamation mark.

17:55.073 --> 17:57.843
Exclamation mark.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.478
[beep]

18:08.787 --> 18:11.557
[birds chirping]

18:18.030 --> 18:19.264
[screaming]
Ahh!

18:19.331 --> 18:21.099
Jesus Christ!

18:19.331 --> 18:21.099
It's me! It's me!

18:21.166 --> 18:22.334
Jesus!

18:21.166 --> 18:22.334
It's me.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.236
I called you
15 times last night!

18:24.303 --> 18:26.071
Why did you not
call me back?

18:26.138 --> 18:28.307
What were you doing?

18:26.138 --> 18:28.307
I was sleeping.

18:28.373 --> 18:31.176
You were calling me from
two to five in the morning.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.778
Right, right,
oh, fuck.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.279
What did you think
happened to me?

18:34.346 --> 18:36.515
Honestly, I thought
you were dead, okay?

18:36.582 --> 18:39.751
I thought I was now a single
mother, raising our child alone.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.920
Not for one second did you think
I was having an affair?

18:41.987 --> 18:43.589
No.

18:43.655 --> 18:46.158
I know I joke a lot about you
not being around forever,

18:46.225 --> 18:47.726
but, I mean,
I'll be honest,

18:47.793 --> 18:50.429
I thought I had a few more
years of us together.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.565
Thanks.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.565
I slept in my contacts.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.300
Ah, there.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.300
Well, I guess Uber driver

18:55.367 --> 18:57.503
didn't show up,
so we're both still alive.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.538
Or Rob is just really smart
and knows better

18:59.605 --> 19:02.407
than to come back
the same day he gets my key.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.842
Who's Rob?

19:02.474 --> 19:03.842
The Uber driver.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.544
Oh.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.544
Just 'cause Rob didn't come back

19:05.611 --> 19:07.279
last night doesn't mean
he's not coming back.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.781
He's probably just biding his
time until we become complacent,

19:09.848 --> 19:12.684
or he probably sold it on the
black market to, you know,

19:12.751 --> 19:14.486
for thousands of dollars,
and now the person

19:14.553 --> 19:15.787
who's actually
coming to get us,

19:15.854 --> 19:17.356
we don't even know
what they look like,

19:17.422 --> 19:18.824
or he made a replica
of our key--

19:18.891 --> 19:21.326
the point is, there is
legitimately not a world

19:21.393 --> 19:23.262
where we will ever feel safe
in this house again.

19:23.328 --> 19:28.600
Or we could just change the
locks, which is like 60 bucks.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.936
Okay, I mean, yeah,
I guess we can do that.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.940
I mean, you know, if you want
to be a pussy about it.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.277
Yeah, mom, we'll be there
very soon, okay?

19:38.343 --> 19:40.879
My mom said that Amelia only
slept four hours last night

19:40.946 --> 19:44.149
and is currently crying
over the concept of wind.

19:44.216 --> 19:45.584
[text alerts beeping]

19:45.651 --> 19:46.985
You are blowing up.
What's going on?

19:47.052 --> 19:48.453
Oh, it's just everyone
from last night

19:48.520 --> 19:49.955
had brunch together
this morning.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.758
I was supposed to be there.
Bummed I missed it.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.259
It's nice
they're including you.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.594
Well, I kind of told them
they had to,

19:55.661 --> 19:57.396
so it wasn't
really that nice.

19:57.462 --> 19:58.697
That tracks.

19:57.462 --> 19:58.697
But we're all having drinks

19:58.764 --> 20:01.700
on Wednesday night,
so that will be fun.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.036
Probably just go after
I put Amelia to bed.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.838
Oh, shit, I forgot
that I have to do pajama day

20:06.905 --> 20:09.675
early on Thursday morning
at Amelia's school.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.644
Ugh, maybe I can't
do that on Wednesday then.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.547
[text alerts beeping]

20:15.614 --> 20:16.748
Now they're all
heading to Todd's house

20:16.815 --> 20:19.151
to hang by the pool
for the day.

20:19.217 --> 20:20.519
I don't think
I'm making that.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.054
[text alerts beeping]

20:22.120 --> 20:23.755
Oh, you're shitting me!

20:23.822 --> 20:26.191
How do they live like this?

20:26.258 --> 20:29.194
Oh, do I want to see
a movie at nine?

20:29.261 --> 20:32.798
Yeah, I would love to, except
it's Sunday night and it's nine.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.033
[doorbell rings,
text alerts continue]

20:35.100 --> 20:37.603
Who is it?

20:35.100 --> 20:37.603
It's Adam from down the street.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.338
Adam, what's going on?

20:39.404 --> 20:41.707
Nothing much, I'm just checking
in on you-- are you good?

20:41.773 --> 20:43.041
Yeah, I'm good.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.041
Great.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.309
Hey, Andrea.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.812
Hi, Adam, how are you?

20:44.376 --> 20:46.812
I'm good.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.081
Well, you sounded
pretty scared last night.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.515
Glad you're okay.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.883
I'll see you around.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.385
Okay, thanks.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.858
What the hell is that?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.995
Well, when you refused
to call me back last night,

21:03.061 --> 21:08.033
I may have posted a slightly
worried message on NextDoor...

21:08.100 --> 21:10.102
Okay.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.571
...as you.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.571
Oh, my God, you posted as me?

21:12.638 --> 21:14.506
Why?

21:12.638 --> 21:14.506
Well, because when I signed up,

21:14.573 --> 21:17.476
I didn't want to register under
my name because I'm Google-able.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.878
Well, so am I.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.878
True...

21:19.945 --> 21:21.380
But I will say,
I think this is actually

21:21.446 --> 21:22.881
going to be good for you

21:22.948 --> 21:25.817
because people really respond
to your vulnerable side.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.486
Oh, boy.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.486
Because you really
a lot of times

21:27.552 --> 21:29.187
put on sort of a very...

21:29.254 --> 21:30.822
...not cold exterior...

21:29.254 --> 21:30.822
Okay, oh, my God.

21:30.889 --> 21:32.691
...but just sort of
hard to break through.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.192
What did "I" say?

21:34.259 --> 21:37.729
You were just scared
to be alone in the house.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.800
I will admit you used quite
a few exclamation marks.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.235
Did I in any way
come across

21:43.301 --> 21:45.203
like I could handle
the situation?

21:45.270 --> 21:47.806
You did not think you would
live through the night.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.876
But you have contributed
a lot of other good things

21:50.942 --> 21:52.711
to the site, I promise.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.579
Just the other day you
recommended

21:54.646 --> 21:56.515
a fabulous gynecologist,

21:56.581 --> 21:58.784
so you're doing
good stuff.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.219
I look forward to never
talking to our neighbors again.

22:01.286 --> 22:02.654
Well, they're still
cool with me,

22:02.721 --> 22:04.156
so I'll keep you
in the loop.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.360
I think we should keep
the act break

22:08.427 --> 22:09.728
at the bottom of nine still.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.130
Sure, sounds good.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.130
[text alerts beeping]

22:12.197 --> 22:14.966
[laughing]

22:15.033 --> 22:17.102
[text alerts beeping]

22:17.169 --> 22:18.870
Did you mute the text chain?

22:18.937 --> 22:20.439
No.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.579
Busted.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.481
Okay, you...
you don't need...

22:29.548 --> 22:31.817
No... [mock laughs] you don't
need to look so smug.

22:31.883 --> 22:34.019
Yes, I got off a text chain.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.555
You didn't find
Osama Bin Laden.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.290
No, of course I didn't,
it's 2017,

22:38.356 --> 22:40.826
they found him many years ago.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.826
I know.

22:40.892 --> 22:42.861
You're dumb,
your face the dumb, I win.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.496
Listen, I had to get off
the text chain

22:44.563 --> 22:46.531
because it was
making me feel shitty

22:46.598 --> 22:49.067
knowing you guys
were constantly having fun.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.470
I realized that I am very
comfortable really living

22:51.536 --> 22:53.972
in a bubble where I believe that
everybody's given up brunch,

22:54.039 --> 22:55.907
that just sits in me well.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.642
The good news is
we can talk about you now.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.879
Oh, can we also talk about
the 42 texts about a brunch?

23:00.946 --> 23:02.647
That, that is crazy.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.450
How do you guys get
anything else done?

23:05.517 --> 23:07.519
We don't.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.519
Okay, now it's
all coming together.

23:07.586 --> 23:09.121
Let me get a refill.
You need anything?

23:09.187 --> 23:10.689
Yeah, I'll take
a refill, thank you.

23:14.092 --> 23:17.329
[cane clicking]

23:17.395 --> 23:20.465
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

23:21.399 --> 23:22.734
Excuse me?

23:25.504 --> 23:27.205
I can help you.

23:27.272 --> 23:30.442
Oh, thank you very much.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.778
Oh, your skin is so soft.

23:32.844 --> 23:33.845
Are you young?

23:33.912 --> 23:35.781
Um, yeah.

23:35.847 --> 23:37.048
Thanks.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.553
I know that probably
didn't look great, but--

23:41.620 --> 23:44.489
Yeah, welcome to being
a Garbage Person.

23:46.324 --> 23:49.861
That's fair.
I'll take that.

23:49.928 --> 23:54.132
I didn't know that you heard,
heard that part.

23:54.199 --> 23:55.600
I did.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.068
Someone should
say something.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.271
Someone should.

23:59.337 --> 24:01.673
I'm probably not going to be
the person who says something.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.375
I probably won't either.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.444
Got everything?

24:04.743 --> 24:06.444
I think so.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.415
Oh, there's your buddy.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.350
Oh, hey, Sandy!
Good morning.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.852
How are you?

24:18.390 --> 24:21.626
Oh, my God! Pants!
Pants.

24:22.661 --> 24:26.031
We don't have to do this.

24:26.097 --> 24:27.732
Okay.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.340
That was tough to watch.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.340
Yeah.
