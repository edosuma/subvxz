00:51.665 --> 00:52.812
P. A. : <i>There's number 5. </i>

00:52.916 --> 00:55.106
<i>He's moving through between horses. </i>

00:55.106 --> 00:58.026
<i>Number 6 is under a very hard... </i>

00:58.026 --> 01:00.320
(crowd cheering)

01:00.321 --> 01:02.822
<i>Number 4 breaks into the inside... </i>

01:36.711 --> 01:38.484
(muffled shots)

01:56.314 --> 01:59.442
(announcer speaking indistinctly)

02:07.367 --> 02:09.035
P. A. : <i>... he's shooting on through. </i>

02:19.254 --> 02:20.713
<i>Number 1 on the inside</i>

02:20.713 --> 02:22.278
<i>pokes a nose in front... </i>

02:46.157 --> 02:47.304
MAN: He's clean.

02:50.327 --> 02:51.266
So...

02:52.100 --> 02:54.081
MAN: Why are you here? Hmm?

04:45.757 --> 04:47.113
MAN: There was a time.

05:01.816 --> 05:02.963
MAN: 4:35.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.195
You misunderstood.

05:06.195 --> 05:08.072
I wasn't asking for the time.

05:08.072 --> 05:10.992
I was just saying there was a time.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.371
- There was a time?
- Mm-hmm.

05:15.997 --> 05:18.291
Take Brown Sugar back there,
for example.

05:19.438 --> 05:21.732
MAN: She's pretty fucking foxy, right?

05:23.504 --> 05:24.651
She's 70.

05:24.652 --> 05:26.633
If she's a day.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.509
But there was a time.

05:29.656 --> 05:30.699
I don't follow.

05:30.803 --> 05:32.993
The name's Smith.
I'm from out of town.

05:32.993 --> 05:35.391
- Listen, Mr. Smith--
- Just Smith.

05:36.748 --> 05:41.336
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering,

05:41.337 --> 05:43.525
is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.383
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

05:47.385 --> 05:52.284
Kansas City Shuffle is when
everybody looks right and you go left.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.431
Never heard of it.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.038
It's not something people hear about.

05:57.289 --> 05:59.479
Falls on deaf ears, mostly.

06:00.105 --> 06:03.233
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.110
MAN: Twenty years, huh?

06:05.110 --> 06:07.195
No small matter.

06:09.906 --> 06:11.574
Requires a lot of planning.

06:13.347 --> 06:15.328
Involves a lot of people.

06:15.954 --> 06:18.873
People connected
only by the slightest of events...

06:20.229 --> 06:22.001
... like whispers in the night...

06:22.836 --> 06:25.652
... in that place that never forgets,

06:25.653 --> 06:27.529
even when those people do.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.453
It all starts with a horse.

06:35.453 --> 06:38.060
(starting bell rings)

06:38.581 --> 06:40.667
(horse whinnies)

06:40.667 --> 06:43.795
SMITH: <i>It's what they called back then</i>
<i>a drugstore handicap. </i>

06:44.316 --> 06:47.236
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls</i>
<i>"a sure thing, "</i>

06:47.236 --> 06:49.530
<i>so he schemes to make it so. </i>

06:49.531 --> 06:51.407
<i>He calls in The Doc, </i>

06:51.407 --> 06:55.682
<i>a nobbler from Antwerp, known</i>
<i>for his savvy, but not for his discretion. </i>

06:57.663 --> 06:59.853
WOMAN: Fuck me, baby.
Fuck me, baby. Come on, baby.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.772
SMITH: <i>The same could be said</i>
<i>for Doc's jelly on the side-- Gloria. </i>

07:02.772 --> 07:05.275
- Oh, God.
- DOC: Almost there. Almost--

07:05.276 --> 07:08.090
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

07:08.090 --> 07:09.133
(Doc groans)

07:11.427 --> 07:13.722
(phone rings)

07:15.703 --> 07:17.163
- (ring)
- (man snoring)

07:17.163 --> 07:18.623
SMITH: <i>Which brings us to Abe, </i>

07:18.727 --> 07:21.855
<i>because Gloria was too much jelly</i>
<i>for one outfit. </i>

07:22.481 --> 07:24.775
Hey, baby.
Is your wife around?

07:24.775 --> 07:27.694
- ABE: <i>What do you want?</i>
- WOMAN: <i>Who is it, Abe?</i>

07:27.695 --> 07:29.988
ABE: <i>Uh... Seymour. </i>

07:29.988 --> 07:31.031
GLORIA: Sure.

07:31.031 --> 07:33.638
<i>Tell that bitch to open her eyes. </i>
<i>Maybe then she'd see more. </i>

07:34.159 --> 07:36.036
ABE: Seymour says hello!

07:36.661 --> 07:38.955
What are you doing
calling me here?

07:38.956 --> 07:41.145
Christmas came early this year, baby.

07:41.145 --> 07:42.918
I got a present for you.

07:42.918 --> 07:44.377
Remember my friend Doc?

07:45.003 --> 07:48.131
SMITH: <i>Now, Abe wasn't a nosy fella, </i>
<i>but he had a nose. </i>

07:49.070 --> 07:51.259
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth. </i>

07:52.511 --> 07:55.430
- ABE: Do you remember Gloria the hooker?
- Mm-hmm.

07:55.430 --> 07:59.393
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

07:59.395 --> 08:03.251
The fix is in at Aqueduct.
7 horse, tenth race.

08:03.253 --> 08:04.190
- Doped up?
- Yeah.

08:04.294 --> 08:05.963
SMITH: <i>And then there was this joker</i>
<i>who had ears... </i>

08:05.963 --> 08:07.318
ABE: Keep it under your hat, huh?

08:07.422 --> 08:09.195
Let's get back.

08:09.195 --> 08:11.072
SMITH: <i>... and who looked</i>
<i>like he could be somebody's uncle. </i>

08:11.072 --> 08:13.470
Hey, Max, who's your favorite uncle?

08:13.470 --> 08:16.598
Okay, who's your second favorite uncle?

08:16.599 --> 08:20.039
Just pay attention.
I got something here.

08:20.039 --> 08:21.395
SMITH: <i>And before you know it, </i>

08:21.396 --> 08:23.897
<i>folks are getting a big dose</i>
<i>of the gimmies, </i>

08:23.897 --> 08:25.878
<i>and men start talking their hats off, </i>

08:25.879 --> 08:29.319
<i>and that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine</i>
<i>spills in your ear</i>

08:29.319 --> 08:31.092
<i>and tells you you got a sure thing, </i>

08:31.093 --> 08:34.429
<i>and what's worse is, </i>
<i>you start to believe it. </i>

08:34.429 --> 08:36.827
<i>At least that's how it went with Old Max, </i>

08:36.827 --> 08:40.058
<i>who wasn't so much old</i>
<i>as he was tired. </i>

08:40.059 --> 08:42.457
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day. </i>

08:42.457 --> 08:45.273
<i>Tired of waking up and finding</i>
<i>that his dreams were only dreams. </i>

08:45.274 --> 08:46.524
We're leavin'.

08:46.524 --> 08:50.800
<i>But mostly, Max was tired</i>
<i>of not having a front lawn. </i>

08:50.801 --> 08:52.677
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

08:52.677 --> 08:53.720
I will.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.431
- I was talking to your son.
- (chuckles)

08:56.432 --> 08:58.516
- You think that's funny, do you?
- Uh-huh.

08:58.516 --> 08:59.559
Bye, Mom.

08:59.559 --> 09:01.644
MAX: Yeah. Bye, Mom.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.208
Love you.

09:07.483 --> 09:10.612
(crowd cheering,
announcer on loudspeaker)

09:12.801 --> 09:15.929
MAX: All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

09:15.929 --> 09:16.972
BOY: Shea Stadium.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.328
- MAX: To see?
- BOY: Mets-Phillies.

09:18.328 --> 09:20.726
MAX: Good man.
Give me the postgame.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.645
BOY: Stalium gave up six runs
in the first five innings.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.418
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive
down right field,

09:25.418 --> 09:27.399
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.214
Jesse Gonder hit a groundball
in the hole between first and second,

09:30.214 --> 09:31.257
but the guy's so slow,

09:31.257 --> 09:33.864
that second baseman Tony Taylor
tagged him out at first.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.429
(laughs)

09:35.533 --> 09:37.202
Did you get all that from the radio?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.453
Mm-hmm.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.913
You're good.

09:40.643 --> 09:42.207
Okay, I'll be right back.

09:42.728 --> 09:44.709
No, no, no, no.
You gotta stay in the car.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.169
Why?

09:47.003 --> 09:50.340
Because they don't let little boys
inside the track.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.008
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

09:52.009 --> 09:55.449
Yeah, well, Saul's dad
is a degenerate gambler.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.117
And if you're the son
of a degenerate gambler,

09:57.222 --> 09:58.264
they let you in.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.184
It's economically viable.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.686
Are you gonna be
a degenerate gambler?

10:03.686 --> 10:06.189
Hey. You know better than that.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.421
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

10:11.507 --> 10:15.052
Look, this money's
gonna get you through Harvard,

10:15.053 --> 10:16.512
and you're gonna be a doctor.

10:17.137 --> 10:20.578
But until then, you gotta stay in the car.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.229
Hey.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.878
Next weekend,
you and me go to a ballgame.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.547
- Okay.
- Okay?

10:30.589 --> 10:32.779
- Love you, kiddo.
- Love you, too, Dad.

10:34.135 --> 10:35.907
Wait-- watch.
Watch, watch, watch.

10:35.907 --> 10:36.846
Almost forgot.

10:36.846 --> 10:39.765
Fifteen minutes.
Start counting.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.647
P. A. : <i>Our next race</i>
<i>at Aqueduct is the tenth race. </i>

10:46.647 --> 10:49.462
<i>It's at a distance of one furlong. </i>

10:56.657 --> 10:58.117
Come on, come on.

10:58.847 --> 10:59.994
Come on, come on.

11:00.098 --> 11:01.245
P. A. : <i>The final turn, </i>

11:01.245 --> 11:04.790
<i>and number 7 has moved</i>
<i>to the fifth position on the outside. </i>

11:04.791 --> 11:06.041
<i>Number 2 takes the lead. </i>

11:07.606 --> 11:08.961
Come on, come on.

11:09.691 --> 11:11.360
<i>Number 1 is at the rail, </i>

11:11.360 --> 11:16.052
<i>and number 7 is beginning</i>
<i>to pick up the pace on the outside. </i>

11:16.053 --> 11:17.095
Yes!

11:17.199 --> 11:19.181
Yes! Come on, baby! Come on!

11:20.640 --> 11:21.683
Go! Let's go!

11:25.020 --> 11:28.461
- <i>And number 7 takes the lead!</i>
- Yes, yes!

11:29.503 --> 11:30.963
Come on, come on!

11:33.153 --> 11:34.613
Yeah!

11:39.305 --> 11:40.556
<i>Number 7 has fallen!</i>

11:43.059 --> 11:46.500
<i>And number 1 goes on</i>
<i>and takes the lead to win it. </i>

11:46.500 --> 11:50.149
SMITH: <i>Max woke up to find that</i>
<i>his dreams had just been the stuff of pipes. </i>

11:50.150 --> 11:51.296
MAX: I wanna place a bet.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.486
- How much?
- Twenty large.

11:55.258 --> 11:56.927
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

11:58.699 --> 12:00.369
BOOKIE: I'll take your bet.

12:00.369 --> 12:02.037
And lay it off.

12:02.037 --> 12:03.810
I got a bookie's bookie.

12:04.435 --> 12:06.625
I'll give you 2 to 1 on the horse.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.127
Racing form says 9 to 1.

12:10.170 --> 12:13.194
So you go to the ticket window
with your 20 grand in hand

12:13.195 --> 12:16.218
and you get 9 to 1
if the spread sticks.

12:16.218 --> 12:20.180
You come in here with your pockets
turned out, you get 2 to 1.

12:20.181 --> 12:22.370
The juice is ten.

12:22.370 --> 12:26.958
That means if you lose,
you're all in for 22 grand.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.773
Twenty for the bet, two for the juice.

12:29.773 --> 12:31.650
Can you pay these moneys?

12:32.276 --> 12:33.840
Huh? Can you?

12:35.299 --> 12:36.446
Yeah.

12:41.764 --> 12:45.622
BOOKIE: Just to be clear, if you lose...

12:46.561 --> 12:48.856
... you're gonna owe a lot of money

12:48.856 --> 12:55.842
to the kind of men you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

13:08.459 --> 13:09.814
MAX: Henry!

13:11.065 --> 13:12.525
Henry!

13:16.175 --> 13:17.426
Henry!

13:20.241 --> 13:21.388
Henry!

13:23.578 --> 13:24.725
- MAN: Hey, buddy.
- MAX: What?

13:24.829 --> 13:26.497
- Got a light?
- No.

13:26.497 --> 13:27.540
MAX: Henry!

13:27.540 --> 13:30.877
MAN: In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the 7 horse?

13:30.878 --> 13:33.379
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.631
Just like you.

13:45.163 --> 13:46.310
Where am I?

13:52.253 --> 13:54.443
MAX: Roth. He'll tell you everything.

13:54.443 --> 13:55.694
I swear.

13:59.448 --> 14:01.221
He already has.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.458
Please.

14:10.084 --> 14:11.543
I have a family!

14:14.984 --> 14:16.236
Please.

14:16.236 --> 14:18.113
Please!

14:18.738 --> 14:20.511
Where's my boy?

14:22.075 --> 14:23.640
MAX: Henry!

14:24.265 --> 14:26.142
(sobbing)

14:26.142 --> 14:27.498
(door opens)

14:28.645 --> 14:29.792
MAX: Where are they?

14:33.024 --> 14:35.214
MAX: Aah!

14:37.821 --> 14:38.863
MAX: Henry!

14:41.053 --> 14:42.200
Aah!

14:43.868 --> 14:46.162
(screaming)

14:47.935 --> 14:49.291
(cocks hammer)

14:50.333 --> 14:51.584
(gunshot)

14:54.504 --> 14:55.547
MAN: Fuck.

14:56.172 --> 14:57.319
Shit.

14:57.736 --> 14:58.779
Jesus.

14:58.883 --> 15:01.699
Fuck shit Jesus is right.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.201
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

15:04.201 --> 15:06.182
New outfit in town.

15:07.017 --> 15:10.562
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

15:12.127 --> 15:14.004
They're trying to make an impression.

15:15.672 --> 15:17.966
That's a fuckin' story, man.

15:18.592 --> 15:22.554
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-alike contest in Monte Carlo

15:22.555 --> 15:23.909
and came in third.

15:24.431 --> 15:25.995
Now, <i>that's</i> a story.

15:28.185 --> 15:32.877
This... this is something else.

15:33.190 --> 15:36.526
- So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?
- No.

15:36.526 --> 15:39.342
It's just the inciting incident.

15:40.071 --> 15:41.740
The catalyst.

15:42.678 --> 15:46.223
This is a Kansas City Shuffle.

15:46.953 --> 15:48.830
SMITH: They look right...

15:50.081 --> 15:51.854
... and you...

15:51.854 --> 15:53.105
go left.

16:01.657 --> 16:03.221
Sorry about that, son.

16:03.951 --> 16:06.766
Sometimes there's more to life
than just living.

16:08.226 --> 16:12.501
Besides, you can't have
a Kansas City Shuffle without a body.

17:09.224 --> 17:10.685
(gunshot)

17:11.415 --> 17:12.979
- MAN #1: He's down!
- MAN #2: Get the roof!

17:12.979 --> 17:14.021
MAN #1: Up there!

17:20.069 --> 17:23.093
(rings)

17:26.326 --> 17:28.932
(rings)

18:02.821 --> 18:04.907
(loud knocking on door)

18:07.618 --> 18:09.286
(knocking)

18:09.286 --> 18:10.642
I'm coming.

18:11.059 --> 18:13.561
(knocking)

18:13.561 --> 18:14.604
Coming.

18:19.296 --> 18:21.382
Well, it took you long enough.

18:22.738 --> 18:23.885
You're not Nick.

18:23.989 --> 18:26.596
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

18:26.597 --> 18:28.682
Well, I'm short for my height.

18:30.350 --> 18:31.393
See, that makes sense

18:31.497 --> 18:34.208
because I can usually tell
how tall someone is by their knock.

18:34.209 --> 18:37.128
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

18:38.379 --> 18:39.839
So it's a good thing.

18:40.777 --> 18:44.218
I don't know. I open the door expecting
you to be up here, you're down there.

18:44.219 --> 18:46.929
That combined with
a low center of gravity, forget about it.

18:48.389 --> 18:49.431
Who are you?

18:49.431 --> 18:50.996
I'm Slevin.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.290
And what happened to your nose?

18:54.332 --> 18:56.730
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.441
- Somebody hit you?
- Yeah.

18:59.441 --> 19:00.901
SLEVIN: I was kinda
expecting it, though.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.465
You were kinda expecting it?

19:02.465 --> 19:05.489
Well, they say
bad things happen in threes.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.556
SLEVIN: First I lost my job.

19:10.286 --> 19:13.206
Then I come home to find that my
apartment building had been condemned

19:13.207 --> 19:17.064
due to a hybrid breed
of Ecuadorian super termites.

19:17.065 --> 19:18.941
So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.

19:18.941 --> 19:19.984
(woman moaning)

19:20.088 --> 19:21.756
I had a key so I let myself in.

19:25.614 --> 19:27.700
(bedsprings squeaking)

19:29.890 --> 19:31.975
(both moaning)

19:33.539 --> 19:34.999
Hey, don't stop on <i>my</i> account.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.042
MAN: Oh, shit.

19:38.753 --> 19:39.795
WOMAN: Slevin.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.881
It was an accident.

19:42.402 --> 19:44.592
What, like he tripped and you fell?

19:45.739 --> 19:48.137
(bell chimes)

19:48.137 --> 19:50.222
MAN: <i>Slevin, </i>
<i>do you know what time it is?</i>

19:50.222 --> 19:53.351
Yeah. I'm at the airport.
Are you sure you want me to come out?

19:53.351 --> 19:55.123
MAN: <i>Yeah. Just think, </i>
<i>two weeks in New York</i>

19:55.123 --> 19:58.774
<i>and the only Kelly you'll remember is</i>
<i>the Kelly who gave you your first handjob</i>

19:58.775 --> 20:00.546
<i>on the bus on the way up</i>
<i>to summer camp. </i>

20:00.546 --> 20:03.257
Kelly Perkins. She told me her hands
were dry and that she needed--

20:03.257 --> 20:07.324
<i>Yeah, she said that to a lot of guys. </i>
<i>That's why we called her Jerkins Perkins. </i>

20:07.324 --> 20:09.096
<i>Just call me when you land, all right?</i>

20:09.096 --> 20:10.452
Yeah.

20:19.315 --> 20:23.069
Yeah. So I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

20:23.070 --> 20:24.529
Say, man, you got the time?

20:24.530 --> 20:28.595
Yeah, man. It's... 7:23.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.368
- So you're probably still asleep.
- Yo, yo, yo.

20:30.368 --> 20:32.245
- Anyway, I'll be over in a second, okay?
- You got a smoke?

20:32.245 --> 20:33.392
I don't smoke, man.

20:33.392 --> 20:35.373
THUG: Then why don't you just go ahead
and give me your wallet

20:35.374 --> 20:37.354
and then I'll buy my own smokes?

20:38.188 --> 20:39.231
Am I being mugged?

20:42.255 --> 20:43.819
And so here I am.

20:46.426 --> 20:47.678
You said three.

20:47.678 --> 20:49.972
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

20:49.972 --> 20:52.578
You lost your job,
your apartment building was condemned,

20:52.578 --> 20:54.977
Kelly was cheating on you,
and you got mugged.

20:54.977 --> 20:56.019
That makes four.

20:56.019 --> 20:58.001
When you're on a roll,
you're on a roll.

20:58.105 --> 20:59.148
Interesting.

20:59.149 --> 21:02.901
Although I would add not-the-ever-so-clever
holdup man that one hears so much about.

21:02.901 --> 21:04.257
Well, he did break my nose.

21:04.257 --> 21:06.342
- But overlooked your suitcase.
- It's heavy.

21:06.343 --> 21:08.532
Maybe he thought it wouldn't make
for a very speedy getaway.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.617
True, but then
there's the matter of your watch.

21:10.722 --> 21:11.764
Pretty fancy.

21:11.764 --> 21:13.745
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

21:13.745 --> 21:14.788
Maybe he didn't see it.

21:14.892 --> 21:16.665
Of course he saw it.
He asked you for the time.

21:16.665 --> 21:18.333
You say this is your third mugging?

21:18.333 --> 21:20.523
I'm a... I travel a lot.

21:20.524 --> 21:21.774
Where's Nick?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.547
I don't know.
He was supposed to meet me here.

21:23.547 --> 21:24.798
He never showed up.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.822
- How'd you get in?
- Door was open.

21:27.822 --> 21:29.490
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

21:29.490 --> 21:31.889
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

21:31.889 --> 21:33.348
But you said open.

21:33.348 --> 21:35.539
Could've been.
Hey, what was your name again?

21:35.540 --> 21:38.354
Lindsey.
I live across the hall.

21:38.354 --> 21:40.023
I came over to borrow
a cup of sugar.

21:40.023 --> 21:41.065
Where's your cup?

21:41.065 --> 21:42.734
I said I came over
to borrow a cup of sugar.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.819
If I'd brought a cup, then I would've
said I came over to borrow sugar.

21:44.819 --> 21:46.592
- Touché.
- (phone rings)

21:46.592 --> 21:48.781
Maybe that's Nick.
It's right there.

21:50.033 --> 21:50.971
Hello.

21:52.848 --> 21:53.891
Hello.

21:55.976 --> 21:57.645
They hung up.

21:57.646 --> 21:59.104
Ooh, I have an idea.

21:59.209 --> 22:01.190
Have you used the phone
at all since you've been here?

22:01.190 --> 22:02.545
Not except for that.

22:04.735 --> 22:06.195
Sorry. Wrong number.

22:06.299 --> 22:08.072
That was the Hotel Cheval.

22:08.072 --> 22:10.053
What are you doing?

22:10.053 --> 22:11.825
We know who he called.
Now we find out who called him.

22:11.825 --> 22:13.181
Columbo says
that there are three things--

22:13.181 --> 22:14.432
Columbo?

22:15.266 --> 22:17.039
Yeah. Columbo was this TV detective

22:17.039 --> 22:19.020
- played by Peter Falk--
- I know who Columbo is.

22:19.854 --> 22:22.566
According to Columbo, there are
three things to look for at a crime scene.

22:22.566 --> 22:24.130
What's there now
that wasn't there before,

22:24.130 --> 22:26.633
what was there before that isn't there now,
and what's been moved.

22:26.634 --> 22:29.657
- Is this a crime scene?
- I think Nick's in trouble.

22:29.658 --> 22:31.846
Hello. Sorry. Wrong number.

22:31.846 --> 22:34.557
That was the Hotel Cheval again.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.851
So what? He called a hotel,
a hotel called him back.

22:36.852 --> 22:37.894
It makes sense.

22:37.998 --> 22:39.458
So maybe it's a clue.

22:40.918 --> 22:42.065
A clue to what?

22:42.065 --> 22:43.525
Maybe it's a clue
to what happened to Nick.

22:43.525 --> 22:44.880
We don't know
anything happened to Nick.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.340
LINDSEY: We don't know
that anything didn't happen to Nick.

22:46.341 --> 22:48.425
He said he was gonna meet you.
You're here, he's not, the door was open.

22:48.425 --> 22:49.885
And bad things happen wherever you--

22:49.990 --> 22:51.971
Shit! I gotta stop by work.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.222
It's just for a couple hours.

22:53.222 --> 22:55.933
Um, I'll come back, and then
we can start the investigation.

22:56.871 --> 22:57.914
The investigation?

22:58.018 --> 22:59.582
Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

22:59.583 --> 23:00.521
Okay.

23:03.545 --> 23:04.587
LINDSEY: I totally forgot--

23:07.820 --> 23:09.280
Yeah.

23:09.384 --> 23:10.949
(chuckles) Sorry.

23:10.949 --> 23:12.722
May I borrow a cup of sugar?

23:12.723 --> 23:13.764
SLEVIN: What?

23:15.016 --> 23:17.831
LINDSEY: I never gave it much thought
until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.

23:17.832 --> 23:20.646
I was on my way to the store
and I thought, "Nick-- he'd have sugar. "

23:20.646 --> 23:23.253
You tell me your story,
I leave, sugarless.

23:23.253 --> 23:25.547
I come back in,
you put your penis on exhibition,

23:25.547 --> 23:28.258
and although my coffee's
probably gone bad by now,

23:28.258 --> 23:29.613
I insist on following through.

23:29.718 --> 23:32.116
It's like something
from a Norman Rockwell painting.

23:32.117 --> 23:33.367
What, my penis?

23:33.368 --> 23:35.974
No. (laughs)
No! The sugar.

23:35.975 --> 23:38.685
Neighbors borrowing sugar
from one another.

23:38.685 --> 23:41.396
It's very Andy Griffith.

23:41.396 --> 23:42.543
Yeah.

23:42.543 --> 23:44.003
<i>That's</i> Andy Griffith.

23:44.107 --> 23:45.567
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.

23:45.567 --> 23:47.235
No.

23:47.235 --> 23:49.425
Thanks for the sugar, sugar.

23:58.602 --> 24:01.209
I wanted to
try and catch the next show.

24:01.209 --> 24:02.877
I don't go on again till 8:00.

24:04.441 --> 24:06.109
Okay.

24:12.574 --> 24:14.242
(knock on door)

24:18.726 --> 24:19.977
SLEVIN: It's not nearly 8:00 yet.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.001
The Boss wants to see you.

24:23.001 --> 24:24.252
Who?

24:24.253 --> 24:25.295
The Boss.

24:25.399 --> 24:28.006
- Who's The Boss?
- The guy we work for.

24:28.007 --> 24:29.257
Jesus.

24:29.257 --> 24:31.656
Yo, man, sit your punk ass down!

24:35.514 --> 24:37.808
I'm not the guy you're lookin' for.
I don't live here.

24:37.912 --> 24:39.997
Yeah, well, you look like the guy
that lives here.

24:39.997 --> 24:42.500
Then you don't know
what the guy that lives here looks like.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.315
What he means to say
is you look like you live here.

24:45.315 --> 24:46.880
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

24:46.881 --> 24:48.340
Well, yeah,
I look like I live here, but I don't.

24:48.341 --> 24:51.572
I'm just visiting.
I just got in this morning.

24:51.573 --> 24:55.535
The cat I'm lookin' for,
his name is, uh...

24:55.536 --> 24:57.620
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.706
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

25:01.374 --> 25:02.938
... who are you?

25:02.938 --> 25:04.398
I'm Slevin.

25:06.692 --> 25:07.943
You got some ID?

25:11.071 --> 25:13.991
See, the funny thing about that
is that I got mugged this morning--

25:13.992 --> 25:15.555
Hey, look! Look, look.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.849
Tell it to the one-legged man.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.455
So he can bump it off down the road.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.674
- Hey, listen, mu'fucka!
- Yo, I got this.

25:30.674 --> 25:33.072
- I got this, Elvis.
- Slow-- slow your roll.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.325
- I got this.
- Slow your roll, man.

25:34.326 --> 25:36.618
ELVIS: Just let me.
Just let me, all right?

25:37.661 --> 25:38.600
Mu'fucka,

25:38.704 --> 25:41.623
all I know is The Boss
slides me this here address,

25:41.625 --> 25:43.605
and he says, "Sloe"--that's him--

25:43.709 --> 25:45.690
"Elvis"--that's me--

25:45.691 --> 25:48.401
"bring me the cat who resides
at this here address. "

25:48.402 --> 25:52.676
Now, he told me that today.
You just so happen to be here today.

25:52.677 --> 25:56.013
So I guess you the cat
I'm supposed to pick up...

25:56.638 --> 25:57.681
... today.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.454
But I'm not Nick.

25:59.454 --> 26:01.226
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

26:01.226 --> 26:04.667
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

26:05.084 --> 26:07.274
You can ask Lindsey.
She lives across the hall.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.151
- She's the woman who lives--
- Wait, hold on, hold on.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.819
Man, I ain't asking nobody nothin'!

26:10.819 --> 26:13.322
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent,
whatever the fuck your name is.

26:13.322 --> 26:16.554
The Virgin Mary herself could come
waltzin' up in here with her fine ass,

26:16.554 --> 26:17.910
titties hanging out and everything,

26:17.910 --> 26:20.308
and if she told me
your name was Jesus Christ,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.186
I still gotta take you to see The Boss.

26:22.186 --> 26:23.229
You know why?

26:23.229 --> 26:24.376
No.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.461
Orders.

26:26.565 --> 26:28.963
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

26:28.965 --> 26:32.196
- I think I got the concept.
- Orders is <i>orders</i>.

26:32.717 --> 26:35.637
So I guess no one ever taught you
not to use the word you're defining

26:35.637 --> 26:37.097
in the definition.

26:41.997 --> 26:43.040
Say somethin' else!

26:43.040 --> 26:45.960
I will break your motherfuckin' nose.
I ain't playin' with you.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.984
My nose is already broken.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.130
(punching sound)

26:55.761 --> 26:57.951
- Can I just say one more thing?
- ELVIS: What?!

26:57.951 --> 27:00.245
Can you turn the heat up in here,
'cause it's really cold?

27:01.496 --> 27:02.747
(chuckles) Yeah.

27:02.747 --> 27:07.335
Y-y-you should've thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.925
(static on radio)

27:33.925 --> 27:35.489
(Slevin shivers)

27:42.788 --> 27:43.831
Yeah.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.173
SLEVIN: It's cold out there.

27:52.277 --> 27:53.841
ELVIS: <i>Let's hurry it up, man. </i>

28:05.208 --> 28:06.459
(elevator dings)

28:07.606 --> 28:09.066
Yo, grab his ass.

28:13.341 --> 28:14.905
ELVIS: The Boss is
right up there, chump.

28:37.532 --> 28:41.598
Well, listen, your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

28:42.641 --> 28:44.622
- I'm not Nick Fish--
- MAN: Mr. Fisher.

28:46.083 --> 28:49.419
Are you familiar
with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?

28:50.045 --> 28:52.130
Comic strip I liked as a boy.

28:52.443 --> 28:55.571
The Shmoo was
a loveable creature, really.

28:55.571 --> 28:57.657
Laid eggs,

28:57.657 --> 28:59.325
gave milk...

29:00.994 --> 29:04.852
... and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

29:06.207 --> 29:08.084
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

29:08.084 --> 29:10.482
It could taste like any food you desire.

29:11.525 --> 29:16.113
Shmoo hide cut thin
made fine leather.

29:16.843 --> 29:20.284
Even Shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks.

29:20.909 --> 29:25.601
In essence, The Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

29:25.602 --> 29:29.251
I only bring up the case of The Shmoo
because of its relevance to you

29:29.252 --> 29:30.606
and the reason
you were brought here.

29:30.606 --> 29:32.066
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

29:32.171 --> 29:33.736
I'm The Boss.

29:33.736 --> 29:35.717
I thought he was The Boss.

29:36.447 --> 29:37.489
Why?

29:38.428 --> 29:39.888
Do we look alike?

29:41.243 --> 29:43.746
So, Mr. Fisher,

29:43.746 --> 29:45.205
you were gonna tell me something?

29:46.040 --> 29:47.708
I don't know.
You brought me here.

29:47.709 --> 29:48.646
Yes, I did,

29:48.751 --> 29:51.253
but back when you thought I was him.

29:51.253 --> 29:53.964
I never thought you were him,
I thought he was you.

29:53.964 --> 29:57.822
And I was trying to tell him-- you--
that they picked up the wrong guy.

29:57.823 --> 29:58.969
The wrong guy for what?

29:59.073 --> 30:00.220
Whatever it is
you wanted to see me about.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.367
Do you know
what I want to see you about?

30:01.367 --> 30:02.410
No.

30:02.410 --> 30:03.974
Then how do you know
I have the wrong guy?

30:04.078 --> 30:05.225
Because I'm not Nick Fish--

30:05.225 --> 30:07.311
Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

30:07.311 --> 30:09.709
In that case,
do I still have the wrong guy?

30:11.169 --> 30:13.150
Do you want to give me $96,000?

30:13.150 --> 30:16.487
No. Do you want
to give <i>me</i> $96,000?

30:16.488 --> 30:17.946
No. Should I?

30:17.948 --> 30:19.928
I don't know. Should you?

30:22.118 --> 30:24.308
I don't know. Should I?

30:30.251 --> 30:31.294
Long story short.

30:33.171 --> 30:34.631
I think we're well past that point.

30:34.632 --> 30:36.403
THE BOSS: I bet it was that mouth
that got you that nose.

30:39.636 --> 30:42.451
SLEVIN: Okay, I'm under the impression
that you're under the impression

30:42.451 --> 30:44.537
that I owe you $96,000?

30:44.537 --> 30:47.665
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

30:49.333 --> 30:53.400
You owe Slim, Slim owes me...
you owe me.

30:58.926 --> 31:00.907
Well, in that case, is Slim around?

31:05.704 --> 31:09.040
Hey, Slim.
You know this cat?

31:11.022 --> 31:12.065
Slim?

31:14.568 --> 31:15.610
No use.

31:17.279 --> 31:20.094
THE BOSS: Ever since
somebody shot him, old Slim went deaf.

31:21.137 --> 31:23.326
What happened
to make Slim go deaf?

31:23.326 --> 31:24.369
Why?

31:27.184 --> 31:29.166
Well, because I owe you $96,000,

31:29.167 --> 31:31.459
and I might have a slight problem
coming up with the money.

31:31.459 --> 31:32.502
Oh, okay.

31:32.502 --> 31:36.673
Well, why don't we just
make it an even 90?

31:37.820 --> 31:39.905
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

31:43.346 --> 31:48.560
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor?

31:51.271 --> 31:53.148
Well, it depends on the favor.

31:57.214 --> 31:58.675
THE BOSS: That was my son.

32:00.031 --> 32:02.012
You notice how I said "was"?

32:02.637 --> 32:04.619
Yeah.

32:04.620 --> 32:06.287
That's because he's dead.

32:07.955 --> 32:08.998
Murdered.

32:11.918 --> 32:14.629
Relegated to the past tense.

32:15.880 --> 32:20.051
Sent from an "is" to a "was"
before he'd had his breakfast.

32:20.989 --> 32:22.240
Bummer.

32:29.122 --> 32:31.416
<i>Lex talionis. </i>

32:31.417 --> 32:33.919
The law of retaliation.

32:49.665 --> 32:51.229
THE BOSS: A pact was broken.

32:51.229 --> 32:52.689
My son was murdered,

32:52.793 --> 32:56.234
so The Rabbi's son
must share the same fate.

32:56.547 --> 32:58.111
Whose son?

32:58.111 --> 32:59.779
The Rabbi's.

32:59.883 --> 33:01.969
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

33:02.386 --> 33:03.428
Because--

33:06.035 --> 33:07.912
Because he's a rabbi.

33:07.912 --> 33:09.059
Who's his son?

33:09.998 --> 33:11.353
Yitzchok.

33:11.353 --> 33:13.751
Yitzchok.
Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

33:13.752 --> 33:15.420
Yitzchok The Fairy.

33:17.505 --> 33:19.278
Why do they call him The Fairy?

33:21.363 --> 33:23.866
Because he's a fairy.

33:23.866 --> 33:27.411
What, he has wings, he can fly,
he sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

33:27.412 --> 33:29.809
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

33:29.810 --> 33:31.477
Come on.

33:34.711 --> 33:36.379
So how does The Rabbi feel
about that?

33:36.483 --> 33:38.777
- He doesn't know.
- You know, but he doesn't know.

33:38.777 --> 33:40.654
- Everybody knows.
- Except The Rabbi.

33:40.655 --> 33:41.697
That's right.

33:43.365 --> 33:44.825
So where do I fit in?

33:44.825 --> 33:46.493
You?

33:48.162 --> 33:50.039
You're the trigger man.

33:51.707 --> 33:52.854
Me?

33:52.958 --> 33:54.209
You.

34:01.821 --> 34:03.072
Aren't there professionals?

34:03.177 --> 34:05.054
People you can hire
to do this sort of thing?

34:05.055 --> 34:06.618
(laughs)

34:06.618 --> 34:08.703
Of course there are.

34:08.703 --> 34:10.059
Yes.

34:10.788 --> 34:13.081
But you owe me $96,000.

34:13.083 --> 34:16.628
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

34:18.713 --> 34:20.485
Sorry, kid.

34:20.590 --> 34:23.406
But your money just isn't long enough,

34:23.407 --> 34:25.909
which means you're in my pocket,

34:25.909 --> 34:28.411
which means if you don't do
what I want you to do,

34:28.411 --> 34:31.018
you're gonna go from my pocket
to my fridge.

34:32.478 --> 34:36.857
Slim could use the company,
and I could use The Shmoo.

34:36.858 --> 34:39.047
THE BOSS: So I'll expect
your answer by morning.

34:41.654 --> 34:43.217
Is there anything else?

34:43.217 --> 34:47.076
Well, I don't suppose I have to say
anything as trite and clichéd

34:47.076 --> 34:49.474
as "Go to the police
and you're a dead man. "

34:49.995 --> 34:51.768
I think you just did.

34:51.768 --> 34:53.436
I guess I did.

34:57.190 --> 35:00.735
So, let me see if I've got this right.

35:02.508 --> 35:06.053
I'm paying you a lot of money
to kill somebody,

35:06.053 --> 35:08.451
and you're getting
somebody else to do it?

35:09.808 --> 35:10.851
Don't worry.

35:12.102 --> 35:13.666
I'm gonna kill somebody.

35:18.045 --> 35:20.548
(shutter clicking)

35:20.549 --> 35:22.216
MAN: Better call Brikowski.

35:22.216 --> 35:24.510
Tell him there's a new face in town.

35:27.013 --> 35:29.098
(shutter clicking)

35:45.990 --> 35:47.345
(sighs)

35:55.896 --> 35:56.938
(coughs)

36:01.110 --> 36:03.091
- (knocks)
- Hey.

36:03.091 --> 36:04.655
- Nick still hasn't showed, huh?
- No.

36:04.655 --> 36:05.698
What's with you and that towel?

36:05.698 --> 36:08.201
Oh, it's-- Lindsey.
(sighs)

36:08.202 --> 36:09.660
It's a very long story.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.850
Well, get dressed.
You can tell me about it on the way.

36:11.850 --> 36:13.206
On the way?
Where are we going?

36:13.206 --> 36:16.125
All we know is that somebody
called Nick from the Hotel Cheval.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.419
I spoke to a friend who works there,

36:18.419 --> 36:20.192
she says they keep a record
of every call made from the hotel

36:20.192 --> 36:21.964
and that she can access the computer

36:21.964 --> 36:23.424
and we can find out
what room the call came from.

36:23.424 --> 36:25.092
She should be calling any minute.

36:25.510 --> 36:26.865
What is it?

36:26.865 --> 36:28.012
I know this guy.

36:28.950 --> 36:30.619
- LINDSEY: Who?
- SLEVIN: This guy.

36:33.017 --> 36:36.145
- You know that guy?
- Yeah. I met him.

36:36.145 --> 36:37.605
He was dead.

36:40.107 --> 36:41.672
You met a dead guy?

36:42.923 --> 36:44.070
Yeah.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.365
In a walk-in freezer.

36:49.910 --> 36:52.204
"New York bookmaker Slim Hopkins
was reported missing by his wife.

36:52.204 --> 36:54.915
Police have no leads. "
Blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda.

36:54.915 --> 36:57.000
"Spokesperson commented
off the record,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.024
"'It's ironic that Hopkins
should go missing considering

37:00.025 --> 37:03.257
he's allegedly pinned
behind a few disappearing acts himself. "'

37:07.115 --> 37:10.868
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

37:11.703 --> 37:13.267
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?
- (phone rings)

37:13.371 --> 37:15.143
My phone.
Could be my friend from the hotel.

37:15.143 --> 37:16.290
Be right back.

37:20.566 --> 37:21.921
Hmm.

37:31.305 --> 37:33.079
(pounding on door)

37:33.183 --> 37:36.833
SLEVIN: Yeah, Lindsey, I don't think
it's such a good idea that we continue to--

37:38.605 --> 37:41.838
Put your shoes on.
Schlomo wants to see you.

37:45.070 --> 37:46.739
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

37:47.364 --> 37:49.345
Someone named Schlomo knows you.

37:49.345 --> 37:51.014
That is your only concern.

37:51.431 --> 37:52.891
Let's go.

37:53.725 --> 37:54.767
Like I said, I don't know any--

37:54.872 --> 37:56.853
(strained)
... named Schlomo.

37:57.583 --> 37:58.938
That hurt.

37:59.877 --> 38:02.692
I think it's better
if you let me do the talking.

38:02.693 --> 38:03.839
You think?

38:09.887 --> 38:11.034
What is it?

38:14.787 --> 38:16.456
He's sorry that he hit you.

38:16.457 --> 38:18.750
- You always speak for him?
- MAN: Yes.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.756
So he's a mute, then.

38:24.590 --> 38:25.633
Not quite.

38:25.633 --> 38:27.197
Well, what then?

38:27.822 --> 38:29.491
It's personal.
You have to ask him.

38:29.491 --> 38:31.159
(chuckles)

38:31.263 --> 38:32.619
- How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

38:36.790 --> 38:38.562
- Hey, are we going to the--
- No.

38:39.501 --> 38:41.899
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

38:43.150 --> 38:45.131
SLEVIN: Right across the street
from one another?

38:45.131 --> 38:47.634
One time they were one
with one another,

38:47.635 --> 38:50.032
and then they tried
to kill one another.

38:50.762 --> 38:55.871
Now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation,

38:55.872 --> 38:58.269
for fear of what
the other man will do to him.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.801
Let me guess, all the way up?

39:12.138 --> 39:13.181
Penthouse.

39:21.836 --> 39:24.964
(classical music playing softly)

39:42.586 --> 39:44.462
You must be Mr. Fisher.

39:47.799 --> 39:50.719
Must I? Because that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

39:50.719 --> 39:52.491
But I'm afraid you must.

39:53.221 --> 39:54.368
Well, if I must.

39:54.890 --> 39:57.602
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

40:01.043 --> 40:02.607
For starters, I'm unlucky.

40:02.607 --> 40:06.882
The unlucky are nothing more than a frame
of reference for the lucky, Mr. Fisher.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.801
You are unlucky
so that I may know that I am not.

40:09.802 --> 40:14.076
Unfortunately, the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it's too late.

40:14.076 --> 40:15.328
Take yourself, for instance.

40:15.328 --> 40:17.309
Yesterday, you were better off
than you are today,

40:17.309 --> 40:22.001
but it took today for you to realize it,
but today has arrived, and it's too late.

40:22.002 --> 40:22.939
You see?

40:24.399 --> 40:26.485
People are never happy
with what they have.

40:27.319 --> 40:30.864
They always want what they had,
what someone else has.

40:30.864 --> 40:33.367
SLEVIN: Kind of like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

40:33.367 --> 40:35.765
a gangster who would
rather be a rabbi.

40:35.766 --> 40:36.912
I mean, what is that?

40:36.913 --> 40:40.144
Some sort of the grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

40:40.144 --> 40:43.585
I mean, how do you justify being a rabbi

40:43.585 --> 40:45.254
and a gangster?

40:49.425 --> 40:50.468
I don't.

40:50.989 --> 40:54.535
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been

40:54.535 --> 40:56.828
when I am what could've been
and could not have been.

40:56.828 --> 41:00.791
I live on both sides of the fence.
My grass is always green.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.980
Consider, Mr. Fisher...

41:03.919 --> 41:06.004
... there are two men
sitting here before you,

41:06.004 --> 41:07.985
and one of them
you should be very afraid of.

41:07.987 --> 41:09.132
Where's my money?

41:10.905 --> 41:13.303
- Listen, I've been hearing that a lot lately--
- THE RABBI: My father used to say,

41:13.303 --> 41:16.014
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch 'em on the nose,

41:16.014 --> 41:18.204
"the second time somebody
calls you a horse, you call 'em a jerk,

41:18.204 --> 41:19.872
"but the third time
somebody calls you a horse,

41:19.977 --> 41:23.522
well, then perhaps it's time
to go shopping for a saddle. "

41:32.699 --> 41:33.950
I don't have your money.

41:34.054 --> 41:36.661
This isn't like skipping out on the check.

41:36.661 --> 41:40.415
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

41:40.416 --> 41:41.979
I don't even know
how much money I owe you.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.064
- $33,000.
- But I'm not Nick Fisher.

41:44.064 --> 41:45.211
Then who the hell are you?

41:45.211 --> 41:47.609
I'm just a guy who was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

41:52.406 --> 41:54.283
You have 48 hours to get my money.

41:54.283 --> 41:56.994
Saul will keep an eye on you
in the meantime.

41:56.994 --> 41:58.245
You may go now.

42:04.084 --> 42:05.753
Wait, I just have one question.

42:06.795 --> 42:08.568
I wasn't frisked.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.199
(chuckles)

42:14.199 --> 42:19.204
I see. So being a rabbi,
a religious man...

42:19.205 --> 42:21.707
There are three things
that you may not do in order to save a life,

42:21.707 --> 42:23.167
including his own.

42:23.271 --> 42:27.129
He may not idol worship,
commit adultery,

42:27.130 --> 42:29.840
or perform an act
of premeditated murder.

42:30.674 --> 42:32.447
Killing you
before you killed me would've been--

42:32.447 --> 42:33.490
Kosher.

42:37.973 --> 42:39.120
Acceptable.

42:58.827 --> 43:01.330
I've wired half the money
into your bank in the Caimans.

43:01.330 --> 43:04.562
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

43:04.562 --> 43:06.231
Now, I can expect that when?

43:11.341 --> 43:13.114
- Very soon.
- Good.

43:13.843 --> 43:17.389
So, tell me. The kid.

43:17.390 --> 43:18.536
What do you want with him?

43:21.455 --> 43:23.645
The kid and I have unfinished business.

43:33.342 --> 43:36.470
If there is one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

43:36.470 --> 43:38.973
Man in my position,
it's all he has to go on.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.874
To know a lie when he hears it--
difference between life and death--

43:43.874 --> 43:45.750
your own, someone else's.

43:45.750 --> 43:49.400
That being said, he wasn't lying.

43:50.234 --> 43:51.798
That's not Nick Fisher.

43:52.945 --> 43:53.988
I know.

44:04.833 --> 44:05.876
LINDSEY:
I came back here, you were gone,

44:05.980 --> 44:09.212
so I went to the hotel
without you to see my friend.

44:09.213 --> 44:12.028
She says the call to Nick
came from Room 1009.

44:12.029 --> 44:16.720
A fellow registered under
the name Smith, if you can believe that.

44:16.721 --> 44:18.180
Although it is one of the most
common names in the world,

44:18.180 --> 44:19.848
so there are bound to be
a couple of them.

44:19.848 --> 44:22.559
But I get the feeling
this ain't one of them.

44:22.663 --> 44:25.479
I get up to the tenth floor,
and just as I do,

44:25.480 --> 44:29.545
the door to Room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr. Smith in the flesh.

44:29.546 --> 44:32.778
So I pretend I'm walking to the elevator
instead of coming from it,

44:32.778 --> 44:34.550
and we take it down together.

44:34.550 --> 44:37.470
He smiles at me-- Thanks--
I smile back,

44:37.470 --> 44:40.702
but still, I have no idea who he is,
but I think that you might,

44:40.703 --> 44:42.475
so I take a picture of him
using my cellphone,

44:42.475 --> 44:43.830
which originally
I thought was a total waste

44:43.830 --> 44:46.438
'cause the photos look like shit
and I never use it,

44:46.438 --> 44:50.713
so there I am pretending to dial a number
and taking Smith's picture,

44:50.714 --> 44:52.486
him none the wiser.

44:52.486 --> 44:54.571
This is Smith.
Recognize him?

44:54.675 --> 44:55.718
No.

44:56.448 --> 44:58.534
I didn't think you would,
but it was worth a shot.

44:58.534 --> 45:00.932
Anyway, we take the elevator
down to the lobby,

45:00.932 --> 45:05.728
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

45:05.729 --> 45:07.188
So I followed him.

45:12.297 --> 45:16.051
LINDSEY: He went down
into an apartment building downtown,

45:16.051 --> 45:17.094
so I wait.

45:17.095 --> 45:21.265
An hour goes by,
and just when I'm getting ready to leave,

45:21.266 --> 45:23.037
who walks outside?

45:23.038 --> 45:24.706
- Smith?
- You.

45:28.876 --> 45:29.919
Me?

45:31.587 --> 45:33.674
LINDSEY: You out of the same building.

45:33.674 --> 45:36.072
With two Hasidic Jews
on either side of you.

45:37.010 --> 45:39.096
Friends of yours?

45:40.034 --> 45:41.181
Not exactly.

45:41.181 --> 45:43.267
I think it's time you told me that story.

45:45.561 --> 45:49.002
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right,

45:49.003 --> 45:52.651
and then right across the street,
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

45:52.651 --> 45:53.902
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

45:53.902 --> 45:55.466
Because he's a Rabbi.

46:00.889 --> 46:02.557
THE RABBI: <i>... $33.000. </i>

46:03.600 --> 46:07.666
So now I have to "take out, "
to use the vernacular, The Fairy

46:07.666 --> 46:10.169
in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

46:10.169 --> 46:14.027
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours
to come up with $33,000

46:14.028 --> 46:15.486
or The Rabbi's gonna...

46:16.633 --> 46:18.615
I don't know who Mr. Smith is.

46:19.657 --> 46:22.057
And the worst part about it
is I'm not Nick Fisher.

46:23.516 --> 46:24.559
Ironic.

46:25.185 --> 46:27.270
I know.
I don't even gamble.

46:27.374 --> 46:29.355
No. I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

46:33.005 --> 46:35.612
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

46:35.612 --> 46:36.654
Yeah.

46:36.759 --> 46:40.304
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

46:40.305 --> 46:43.953
Not withstanding, here you are
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

46:44.475 --> 46:45.726
I'd say you're fucked.

46:47.082 --> 46:48.646
Fucked.

46:52.608 --> 46:55.006
Shouldn't you be
a little more worried about all this?

46:55.632 --> 46:57.404
I have anorexia.

46:57.405 --> 46:58.656
Anorexia.

46:59.698 --> 47:01.888
It's a condition characterized
by freedom from worry

47:01.888 --> 47:03.869
or any other preoccupation, really.

47:07.206 --> 47:09.605
Anyway, I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

47:09.605 --> 47:11.169
What are you gonna say?

47:12.525 --> 47:14.714
I'm gonna say what any man
with two penises would say

47:14.714 --> 47:17.113
when his tailor asks him
if he dresses to the right or to the left.

47:17.113 --> 47:18.572
What's that?

47:21.075 --> 47:22.118
Yes.

47:22.222 --> 47:24.724
I knew you had sense.

47:26.393 --> 47:28.791
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

47:29.417 --> 47:31.085
Sometimes.

47:31.606 --> 47:34.317
Sometimes it's
when you know you don't.

47:35.464 --> 47:37.028
Nah, don't move that bishop.

47:37.967 --> 47:39.948
SLEVIN: It's an obvious sucker bet.

47:39.949 --> 47:42.450
If you don't,
you could have him in four moves.

47:42.451 --> 47:45.161
If you do right now,
he's gonna have you in mate in one.

47:47.455 --> 47:49.124
He doesn't see it.

47:49.749 --> 47:51.522
Wouldn't matter if he did.

47:52.148 --> 47:54.129
Elvis lets me win.

47:55.380 --> 47:56.632
Everybody lets me win.

47:57.884 --> 47:58.822
Wait a minute.

47:59.969 --> 48:01.220
You know this game.

48:08.102 --> 48:09.458
THE BOSS: You got three days.

48:11.647 --> 48:14.046
I was thinking it would take me
more like a week.

48:14.046 --> 48:16.235
(laughs)
You were thinking that, were you?

48:16.235 --> 48:18.842
With all your experience killing people.

48:19.885 --> 48:21.449
I'll tell you what.

48:22.596 --> 48:24.890
You win this game, you got your week.

48:40.635 --> 48:42.824
So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

48:45.328 --> 48:46.892
I was gonna play it by ear.

48:46.893 --> 48:49.082
(chuckles) Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down.

48:49.082 --> 48:50.124
It's a tough tune.

48:51.480 --> 48:53.774
By the way, he has shadows.

48:57.319 --> 48:58.674
Shadows?

49:03.158 --> 49:04.722
Bodyguards.

49:05.661 --> 49:07.433
With him all the time.

49:09.310 --> 49:10.874
Military.

49:16.609 --> 49:18.486
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

49:20.050 --> 49:22.240
THE BOSS: They go where he goes
round the clock.

49:22.970 --> 49:24.638
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

49:24.846 --> 49:26.932
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

49:28.809 --> 49:30.373
That doesn't sound good.

49:30.998 --> 49:33.085
THE BOSS: They live
in the apartment next door.

49:33.919 --> 49:37.151
He wears a panic button
on the chain around his neck.

49:37.151 --> 49:39.445
Looks like an ordinary Star of David.

49:40.071 --> 49:43.616
He presses that button and, well,
we all know how that ends.

49:43.617 --> 49:45.076
MAN: What's this?

49:45.702 --> 49:47.370
Oh, God.
No, you didn't.

49:47.371 --> 49:48.830
Get down!

49:49.038 --> 49:50.394
- Get down!
- MAN: What the hell?

49:53.626 --> 49:56.233
SMITH: Response time's gonna be
three to five seconds.

49:56.859 --> 49:59.257
So he's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

49:59.257 --> 50:00.404
Where?

50:01.029 --> 50:02.594
Where?

50:02.595 --> 50:04.262
The apartment.

50:05.305 --> 50:08.537
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

50:09.371 --> 50:12.395
No, I was thinking
you'd use the back door.

50:18.964 --> 50:20.842
Then what?

50:21.885 --> 50:24.491
He does the kid, I do him.

50:25.326 --> 50:28.975
I plant my gun--
clean, no history-- on Yitzchok,

50:28.976 --> 50:32.207
fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands...

50:33.354 --> 50:35.023
... take the clothes off.

50:35.648 --> 50:39.819
Make it look like a
"you do me, I do you, we're both gay,

50:39.820 --> 50:42.218
the world doesn't understand us"
double suicide.

50:43.052 --> 50:44.824
And that's all there is to it.

50:46.284 --> 50:47.848
Is that all there is to it?

50:48.578 --> 50:49.725
Yeah.

50:49.829 --> 50:51.706
That's all there is to it.

50:51.915 --> 50:54.000
(laughing)

51:03.802 --> 51:06.304
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

51:07.764 --> 51:10.059
Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.

51:12.666 --> 51:14.334
Some have grown pretty dead.

51:19.235 --> 51:21.112
You're a conundrum, you.

51:23.093 --> 51:25.387
You walk in here
shooting your fucking mouth off

51:25.387 --> 51:27.993
like you don't give a fuck
if it gets shot off.

51:29.245 --> 51:30.704
You can only kill me once.

51:38.421 --> 51:39.463
Checkmate.

51:45.824 --> 51:48.118
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

51:51.037 --> 51:52.080
Cat.

51:54.270 --> 51:55.417
THE BOSS: Mouse.

51:57.399 --> 51:59.171
You got three days.

52:03.447 --> 52:04.802
THE BOSS: Excuse me.

52:25.761 --> 52:28.472
Who the fuck is this guy?

52:28.993 --> 52:30.140
MAN: Don't know.

52:30.244 --> 52:32.851
Whoever he is, he's either in
very deep shit, or I don't know what,

52:32.851 --> 52:35.666
'cause he's playing in the sandbox
with the Darkies, the Skullcaps,

52:35.667 --> 52:37.022
and who knows who.

52:37.126 --> 52:40.880
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo that Marty snapped.

52:41.923 --> 52:42.965
MAN: Yes, boss.

52:43.487 --> 52:45.782
I want a complete rundown
on this fucker.

52:45.782 --> 52:47.346
Everything from A to Z.

52:47.346 --> 52:49.431
I wanna know who he is,
who does he know.

52:49.431 --> 52:50.682
People he knows,
who do they know?

52:50.683 --> 52:54.019
I want to know what the fuck
he is doing in my fucking city.

53:03.508 --> 53:05.906
- What do you got?
- Get this.

53:05.906 --> 53:07.366
The Kat's in town.

53:08.721 --> 53:09.764
Goodkat?

53:09.765 --> 53:11.224
That's the song the junkies
are singing.

53:11.224 --> 53:12.475
What's the happenstance?

53:12.475 --> 53:13.830
MAN: Didn't know the happenstance.

53:13.830 --> 53:16.124
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

53:17.271 --> 53:20.191
- Who's Goodkat?
- MAN: Real heavy hitter.

53:21.234 --> 53:22.276
The heaviest.

53:22.277 --> 53:24.779
He shows, people die, he vanishes.

53:24.779 --> 53:27.177
No one knows who he is
or what he looks like.

53:27.177 --> 53:30.097
And he hasn't worked New York
in what, two decades?

53:30.097 --> 53:31.766
Just what we need.

53:32.809 --> 53:33.851
All right.

53:33.956 --> 53:36.771
And get some different fucking coffee
in here, will you?

53:36.772 --> 53:39.065
I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

53:47.720 --> 53:50.848
- Hey! I figured it out!
- What'd you figure out?

53:50.849 --> 53:52.516
You said Slim Hopkins
worked for The Boss, right?

53:52.516 --> 53:54.184
- Right.
- Well, listen.

53:55.331 --> 53:57.208
The Rabbi also had a bookie.
His name was Benny Begin,

53:57.208 --> 53:58.564
and right now Begin's
down at the morgue on ice.

53:58.564 --> 54:01.170
- Somebody killed him and his goons.
- At the morgue?

54:01.171 --> 54:02.630
Yeah. Didn't I tell you
I was a coroner?

54:02.630 --> 54:04.507
No, you didn't tell me
you were a coroner.

54:07.010 --> 54:10.033
Benny Begin, killed by a baseball.

54:10.035 --> 54:11.493
LINDSEY: My guess was a fastball.

54:13.787 --> 54:17.020
Either way, it proves that the good Lord
has a sense of humor.

54:17.020 --> 54:19.001
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

54:19.001 --> 54:20.357
- Know this guy?
- Mm-hmm.

54:20.357 --> 54:22.964
Big time bookie.
Worked for The Rabbi.

54:22.964 --> 54:25.467
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

54:25.467 --> 54:30.055
Between you and me,
20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.

54:30.055 --> 54:32.244
I used to send my paychecks
over to him.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.789
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

54:35.789 --> 54:37.145
These two were poisoned.

54:38.292 --> 54:39.647
Something exotic.

54:40.794 --> 54:43.401
- I'm running it down.
- Let me know.

54:43.401 --> 54:44.444
Will do.

54:45.591 --> 54:46.738
Prick.

54:50.283 --> 54:52.994
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

54:58.208 --> 55:00.293
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

55:01.961 --> 55:03.838
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding.

55:03.838 --> 55:05.298
He set you up!

55:05.298 --> 55:07.383
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

55:07.385 --> 55:09.470
Nick found himself in a jam,
he got you to take his place.

55:09.470 --> 55:11.243
He paid some street thug to mug you,

55:11.347 --> 55:13.328
but all he really wants
is your wallet with your license.

55:13.329 --> 55:15.935
That's why he ignores
the watch and the suitcase.

55:15.936 --> 55:17.812
Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins
and Benny Begin,

55:17.813 --> 55:19.271
the only guys who know
what he looks like,

55:19.271 --> 55:20.731
and now you're left holding the bag!

55:21.148 --> 55:23.234
But I called Nick.
I initiated contact.

55:23.234 --> 55:25.215
Well, maybe it just seems that way.

55:25.215 --> 55:26.258
What about Smith?

55:26.675 --> 55:28.864
I still can't figure him out in all this.

55:29.490 --> 55:30.637
You should run.

55:30.637 --> 55:31.784
I can't.

55:31.784 --> 55:34.286
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

55:34.286 --> 55:35.538
Then go to the police!

55:36.372 --> 55:37.936
These guys buy cops
like cops buy doughnuts.

55:38.040 --> 55:39.917
This isn't the first time
this has happened, you know?

55:39.917 --> 55:41.377
You mean this isn't the first time

55:41.377 --> 55:43.358
a crime lord asked you to kill
the gay son of a rival gangster

55:43.358 --> 55:45.339
to pay off a debt that belongs to a friend
whose place you're staying in

55:45.443 --> 55:47.007
as a result of losing your job,
your apartment,

55:47.007 --> 55:48.884
and finding your girlfriend in bed
with another guy?

55:48.884 --> 55:50.448
No, this is the first time
that happened,

55:50.553 --> 55:53.368
but Nick has been painting me
into corners since we were kids.

55:55.245 --> 55:57.748
I guess I've always been a better friend
to him than he's been to me.

55:57.748 --> 56:01.085
I'd love to hear the rest of this,
but I really gotta go back to work.

56:01.711 --> 56:03.275
Oh, hey! Hey!

56:03.276 --> 56:05.256
H-hey.

56:05.256 --> 56:07.758
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight,

56:07.758 --> 56:10.991
maybe... I don't know,

56:10.991 --> 56:13.910
we could go to dinner
or something?

56:17.664 --> 56:19.228
Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.

56:19.332 --> 56:21.314
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:22.043 --> 56:23.086
Yeah, sure.

56:23.086 --> 56:24.233
Okay.

56:24.650 --> 56:25.693
Um, no.

56:25.694 --> 56:26.840
Bye!

56:34.452 --> 56:36.224
What a weirdo.

56:44.150 --> 56:46.235
(laughs)

56:46.235 --> 56:47.799
What?

56:47.799 --> 56:49.676
I was just thinking about
what it would be like

56:49.676 --> 56:52.075
if we'd met
under different circumstances.

56:52.075 --> 56:54.368
See, I think people
should only fall in love

56:54.370 --> 56:56.245
if there's a great story
behind how they met.

56:57.080 --> 57:00.416
You know, seeing as how
you have to tell it over and over again.

57:00.417 --> 57:01.667
If you and I fell in love,

57:01.668 --> 57:03.649
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

57:03.753 --> 57:04.796
Yeah.

57:04.796 --> 57:06.881
We'd be at a dinner party
and someone would ask,

57:06.882 --> 57:08.132
"So, how'd you two meet?"

57:08.237 --> 57:10.322
And I'd say,
"You tell the story, dear, "

57:10.322 --> 57:12.512
and you'd say,
"No. You tell it better. "

57:12.513 --> 57:13.450
(chuckles)

57:16.891 --> 57:18.351
So, come here often?

57:20.540 --> 57:21.583
No.

57:22.939 --> 57:24.607
But I heard about someone who does.

57:26.901 --> 57:28.361
- You mean The Fairy?
- Yeah.

57:28.362 --> 57:29.299
- Is he... ?
- Yeah.

57:31.176 --> 57:32.220
Where?

57:38.476 --> 57:40.666
This is absurd!
What are you thinking?

57:41.917 --> 57:42.960
I'm thinking of a new option.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.941
- What's that?
- Talking with him.

57:45.045 --> 57:46.818
- Talking with him?
- Talking with him.

57:46.819 --> 57:48.903
You're just gonna walk over and say,
"Hi, my name is Slevin,

57:48.903 --> 57:50.572
"and some bad dudes think
I'm someone that I'm not,

57:50.572 --> 57:53.074
"and this someone owes that someone
and now I'm gonna have to take you out

57:53.074 --> 57:54.117
"or they're gonna take me out

57:54.221 --> 57:56.306
and I was just wondering,
you wanna talk about it"?

57:56.306 --> 57:58.496
- I can't do that.
- Ya think?

57:58.496 --> 58:00.999
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

58:00.999 --> 58:03.397
Aside from that,
you're pretty much dead on.

58:04.440 --> 58:05.587
Bodyguards?

58:05.587 --> 58:07.255
Yeah. Right behind him.
Two of them.

58:07.255 --> 58:08.402
Israelis.

58:08.506 --> 58:09.549
Beards.

58:09.549 --> 58:10.800
Right behind him.

58:11.634 --> 58:12.781
SLEVIN: See 'em?

58:16.431 --> 58:17.473
You're getting good at this.

58:17.473 --> 58:18.620
Thanks.

58:18.725 --> 58:20.290
How are you gonna
have a talk with him?

58:20.290 --> 58:23.105
I'm gonna wait till he goes to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna follow him in.

58:23.835 --> 58:24.878
What do you think?

58:26.650 --> 58:28.944
MARTY: <i>Can someone tell me</i>
<i>why I'm in the van?</i>

58:30.195 --> 58:32.907
BRIKOWSKI: <i>Because I could only get</i>
<i>a reservation for two. </i>

58:33.845 --> 58:36.556
<i>All right. The Fairy's</i>
<i>at a table in the middle, </i>

58:36.557 --> 58:38.329
<i>bodyguards nearby, </i>

58:38.330 --> 58:39.997
<i>our boy's not far away, </i>

58:39.997 --> 58:42.082
<i>but I can't make out who's with him. </i>

58:42.082 --> 58:43.855
<i>Did Murph get a beat on him yet?</i>

58:44.376 --> 58:46.357
MARTY: <i>Murph says whoever he is, </i>
<i>he's a ghost. </i>

58:46.357 --> 58:48.339
<i>Can't find anyone</i>
<i>who's ever even bumped into him, </i>

58:48.339 --> 58:50.215
<i>much less tripped over him. </i>

58:54.595 --> 58:56.472
BRIKOWSKI:
<i>Fairy's going to the bathroom. </i>

59:00.955 --> 59:03.458
<i>And our boy's making a move. </i>
<i>Shit. </i>

59:25.043 --> 59:27.650
- Marty, the door's locked.
- MARTY: <i>Relax. </i>

59:27.650 --> 59:29.944
It's not gonna go down
in the men's room.

59:34.219 --> 59:35.574
I got next.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.788
LINDSEY: What went down
in the men's room?

59:40.788 --> 59:42.456
- We talked.
- And?

59:42.457 --> 59:44.437
I told him I thought
we should get together sometime.

59:44.437 --> 59:45.793
- You didn't.
- I did.

59:45.794 --> 59:46.836
And?

59:47.670 --> 59:48.817
I got a date.

59:48.921 --> 59:51.215
Oh, my God.
Do you think this is safe?

59:51.215 --> 59:54.030
It can't be any worse than what's
waiting for me behind door number 2.

59:56.221 --> 59:58.411
It's gonna be tough, though.
I think I picked up a pigtail.

59:58.412 --> 01:00:00.809
- A what?
- The cops.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:04.771
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.316
I ran into a nosy cop
in the men's room.

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.265
You and me need to talk.

01:00:23.644 --> 01:00:24.687
Do I know you?

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:26.355
No. But I know you.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.052
Listen, buddy, I'm sorry.
No offense or anything, but I'm not--

01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:37.825
I'm not gay.

01:00:37.929 --> 01:00:39.285
I'm a cop.

01:00:40.119 --> 01:00:42.413
Yeah, well, I'm not a robber,
if you catch my drift.

01:00:43.144 --> 01:00:44.187
I've been watching you.

01:00:44.187 --> 01:00:46.272
I know what you're into.

01:00:47.106 --> 01:00:48.357
Who are you?

01:00:48.357 --> 01:00:50.860
I mean, I know who you're not.
I know you're not Nick Fisher.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.633
The guy whose apartment
you're staying in.

01:00:52.737 --> 01:00:55.239
I know this because Nick Fisher
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:58.367
for forcing himself
on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

01:00:58.369 --> 01:01:00.766
Dade County sent me a picture
of Nick Fisher,

01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:02.643
and you are not him.

01:01:02.747 --> 01:01:07.126
So who the fuck are you?

01:01:09.942 --> 01:01:12.235
I'm just a guy
whose dinner's getting cold.

01:01:14.008 --> 01:01:15.364
May I leave now?

01:01:16.094 --> 01:01:17.241
- SLEVIN: Come here.
- What?

01:01:17.345 --> 01:01:18.909
Dead bodies in refrigerators,

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:20.994
cops in men's rooms?

01:01:20.994 --> 01:01:23.497
You remind me of James Bond.

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:29.753
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

01:01:29.754 --> 01:01:31.631
And The Boss, he can be Kananga.

01:01:31.735 --> 01:01:33.091
Kananga?

01:01:34.446 --> 01:01:37.053
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Then who's The Boss?

01:01:37.054 --> 01:01:39.973
Ernst Stavros Blofeld.

01:01:39.974 --> 01:01:41.537
Which one?
Donald Pleasence?

01:01:41.537 --> 01:01:44.560
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

01:01:44.562 --> 01:01:46.020
(as Sean Connery)
You know your Bond.

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:48.001
But alas, I was referring
to Anthony Dawson.

01:01:48.001 --> 01:01:49.148
Who?

01:01:49.878 --> 01:01:52.485
Well, he played Blofeld
in <i>From Russia with Love</i>.

01:01:52.485 --> 01:01:55.717
We never see Blofeld's face
in <i>From Russia with Love</i>.

01:01:55.719 --> 01:01:57.699
That's when the villain is most effective--

01:01:57.699 --> 01:01:59.576
(as Sean Connery)
when you don't know what he looks like.

01:01:59.577 --> 01:02:00.618
(laughs)

01:02:04.998 --> 01:02:07.083
(laughs)

01:02:18.553 --> 01:02:19.597
So...

01:02:22.933 --> 01:02:23.976
See you later.

01:02:52.233 --> 01:02:55.049
- SLEVIN: That was incredible.
- (Lindsey laughs)

01:02:57.134 --> 01:02:59.949
- (Lindsey laughing)
- SLEVIN: I just realized something.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:02.556
- LINDSEY: What's that?
- I just made love to you...

01:03:02.556 --> 01:03:04.537
LINDSEY: You're just
realizing that now?

01:03:04.537 --> 01:03:07.458
SLEVIN: And I have no idea
who specifically you're referring to

01:03:07.459 --> 01:03:09.230
when you say James Bond.

01:03:09.335 --> 01:03:13.714
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

01:03:13.715 --> 01:03:18.094
and I was saying that it was
the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me,

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:19.345
I naturally assumed that you--

01:03:19.345 --> 01:03:21.952
I naturally assumed that you knew
who I was talking about.

01:03:27.686 --> 01:03:32.274
Because if you aren't talking about the guy
that I think you're talking about...

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.464
well, then you have me
mistaken for somebody else,

01:03:34.465 --> 01:03:37.488
because in my mind,
there is only one Bond.

01:03:38.531 --> 01:03:40.303
Well, on that we agree.

01:03:43.014 --> 01:03:44.683
Same time, on three.

01:03:44.683 --> 01:03:46.247
- One.
- Two.

01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:47.289
Three.

01:03:47.289 --> 01:03:48.436
- George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:49.583
- SLEVIN: George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore?

01:03:49.584 --> 01:03:50.939
- Are you kidding me?
- I was kidding.

01:03:50.939 --> 01:03:52.399
Yeah, I was kidding, too.

01:03:52.503 --> 01:03:54.484
The only James Bond...

01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:56.153
- is Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:02.410
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.869
- I do.
- (Lindsey laughing)

01:04:35.359 --> 01:04:36.611
Where are you going?

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:39.947
I'm just gonna get us some coffee.

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:42.658
Okay.

01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:48.186
Hurry back to me.

01:04:49.541 --> 01:04:50.688
(slow song playing on radio)

01:04:50.688 --> 01:04:54.129
WOMAN: # When you're in love #

01:04:54.129 --> 01:04:58.300
# You're happy #

01:04:58.717 --> 01:05:03.513
# Oh, and when you're in her arms #

01:05:03.514 --> 01:05:08.206
# You gave #

01:05:11.438 --> 01:05:12.898
# It doesn't matter... #

01:05:13.002 --> 01:05:14.462
Police.

01:05:14.462 --> 01:05:16.130
Come on, man.

01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:19.154
I already talked to your buddy.

01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:29.164
MAN: Morning.

01:05:29.165 --> 01:05:30.833
I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.232
Good morning, Detective Dumbrowski.
Am I being kidnapped?

01:05:33.232 --> 01:05:36.568
No. We just wanna have
a quick friendly word with you.

01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:39.905
Is this the standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policemen's manual

01:05:39.905 --> 01:05:41.365
if you looked up "quick friendly word. "

01:05:41.365 --> 01:05:44.389
There is no SOP for the kind of box
you've got yourself into, kid.

01:05:44.389 --> 01:05:45.431
Oh.

01:05:50.228 --> 01:05:52.835
- So what'd you want to talk to me about?
- You.

01:05:53.356 --> 01:05:54.816
- What about me?
- Who are you?

01:05:54.816 --> 01:05:55.858
(chuckles)

01:05:55.858 --> 01:05:57.423
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

01:05:57.527 --> 01:05:58.569
Rank, serial number?

01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:00.968
- You should really play ball, kid.
- Really? You think I'm tall enough?

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:13.689
BRIKOWSKI: What is your name?

01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:15.149
(strained)
Oh, yeah. I remember.

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:16.400
Slevin Kelevra.

01:06:16.504 --> 01:06:18.903
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

01:06:18.903 --> 01:06:20.050
Kelevra.

01:06:20.989 --> 01:06:24.742
Look, kid, I don't know what's going on
or how you're into this,

01:06:24.744 --> 01:06:27.662
but when I figure out
what there is to figure out,

01:06:27.662 --> 01:06:29.643
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

01:06:30.373 --> 01:06:33.084
This is nice?
Don't do me any favors.

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:35.691
Last chance to come clean.

01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:43.824
Take a walk.

01:06:46.327 --> 01:06:49.350
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

01:07:36.378 --> 01:07:37.525
(slow song playing)

01:07:37.629 --> 01:07:40.966
# When you're in love #

01:07:40.967 --> 01:07:45.553
# You're happy #

01:07:45.555 --> 01:07:50.141
# Oh, and when you're in her arms #

01:07:50.142 --> 01:07:55.252
# You gave #

01:07:58.171 --> 01:08:01.508
# This doesn't matter... #

01:08:02.134 --> 01:08:03.802
I have to go to work.

01:08:04.636 --> 01:08:05.783
Hey.

01:08:23.926 --> 01:08:25.386
(pounding on door)

01:08:33.728 --> 01:08:35.292
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:36.751
Now's the time.

01:08:37.794 --> 01:08:39.254
No, I got at least--

01:08:39.255 --> 01:08:40.296
Jesus.

01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:43.322
The Boss says he wants you
to look nice for The Fairy.

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:26.281
(elevator dings)

01:09:56.938 --> 01:09:58.189
(knocks)

01:10:01.943 --> 01:10:02.986
You're early.

01:10:06.844 --> 01:10:09.033
Why don't you come in
and fix yourself a drink?

01:10:09.033 --> 01:10:10.702
I was just getting ready.

01:10:22.902 --> 01:10:24.883
You'll have to excuse the...

01:10:24.883 --> 01:10:28.533
I wasn't expecting you for another...

01:10:29.367 --> 01:10:30.618
You look good.

01:10:31.974 --> 01:10:33.329
You want some wine?

01:10:34.893 --> 01:10:36.249
Something the matter?

01:10:40.733 --> 01:10:42.401
Somebody's trying to kill you.

01:10:44.069 --> 01:10:45.216
Who?

01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:50.430
Me.

01:10:51.055 --> 01:10:52.620
(muffled shots)

01:11:28.281 --> 01:11:29.324
(gun hammer cocks)

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.382
That was close.

01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:47.050
Yeah.

01:12:04.256 --> 01:12:06.341
(men speaking indistinctly)

01:13:05.151 --> 01:13:06.506
Close.

01:14:29.717 --> 01:14:32.428
THE BOSS: I hired you to do a job.

01:14:33.575 --> 01:14:36.077
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

01:14:37.745 --> 01:14:43.585
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.381
... and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job

01:14:48.381 --> 01:14:50.779
is beginning to look very much

01:14:50.779 --> 01:14:52.656
like a job.

01:15:01.519 --> 01:15:05.064
All right. Fuck it.

01:15:06.212 --> 01:15:11.113
If The Rabbi wants a war,
I'll give him a war.

01:15:17.057 --> 01:15:19.038
(phone ringing)

01:15:19.039 --> 01:15:20.393
THE RABBI: Saul.

01:15:22.792 --> 01:15:23.834
(phone ringing)

01:15:23.834 --> 01:15:25.085
- (door opens)
- Saul?

01:15:26.545 --> 01:15:29.152
Saul, the phone's been--

01:15:29.152 --> 01:15:30.508
Oh!

01:15:31.133 --> 01:15:32.384
I thought you were Saul.

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.536
A lot of people have been thinking
I'm somebody else these days.

01:15:41.873 --> 01:15:44.584
Your predicament
reminds me of a story.

01:15:44.584 --> 01:15:47.712
Hitchcock. <i>North by Northwest. </i>

01:15:47.712 --> 01:15:50.528
The movie where everybody
thinks Cary Grant is

01:15:50.529 --> 01:15:51.883
a man named George Kaplan,

01:15:51.987 --> 01:15:53.760
but the thing is there is
no George Kaplan.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.828
It's just a made-up name,
but names, even made-up ones...

01:16:00.017 --> 01:16:02.207
... they can bring about
quite a bit of trouble.

01:16:04.292 --> 01:16:08.463
Now, the woman
in the picture with Grant,

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:09.610
her name was, um...

01:16:09.714 --> 01:16:10.966
Eva Marie Saint.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.113
Oh, you know this movie.

01:16:12.113 --> 01:16:13.781
I know this movie.

01:16:13.781 --> 01:16:16.284
THE RABBI: Took my father
to see it in 1959.

01:16:16.285 --> 01:16:20.142
His English wasn't very good,
but, boy, did he like Miss Saint.

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:22.957
After the movie, he turned to me
and he said, "She's a real Buick. "

01:16:22.957 --> 01:16:26.502
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word "beauty, " so he'd say Buick.

01:16:27.962 --> 01:16:29.526
Caused quite a bit of confusion.

01:16:29.943 --> 01:16:32.028
Using the wrong name will do that.

01:16:36.199 --> 01:16:37.242
Is that my money?

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.953
This is everything I owe you.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:11.757
(phone ringing)

01:17:13.738 --> 01:17:15.093
It's the Sabbath.

01:17:15.093 --> 01:17:18.326
You see, we don't answer the phone
on the Sabbath.

01:17:18.327 --> 01:17:19.473
I know.

01:17:20.515 --> 01:17:22.497
Normally, Saul turns off the ringer.

01:17:22.497 --> 01:17:23.644
Saul!

01:17:23.644 --> 01:17:26.250
I tell ya, you can't find
good help these days.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:29.274
(phone ringing)

01:17:30.005 --> 01:17:31.048
Saul's dead.

01:17:35.427 --> 01:17:36.887
They're all dead.

01:17:45.646 --> 01:17:48.357
(groaning)

01:18:01.495 --> 01:18:03.267
Oh, I've been in this room before.

01:18:05.874 --> 01:18:08.064
Looks the same as it did
20 years ago.

01:18:09.002 --> 01:18:13.486
Somehow... somehow
it seems different,

01:18:13.487 --> 01:18:17.031
the way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:21.307
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.208
Two decades spent
behind three inches of bulletproof glass

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:31.317
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet rooftops in New Jersey.

01:18:31.318 --> 01:18:32.673
Twenty years...

01:18:35.175 --> 01:18:38.512
... locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:41.223
(coughs loudly)

01:18:41.224 --> 01:18:44.143
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

01:18:47.792 --> 01:18:50.712
THE RABBI: Well, Anthony,
looks as though you've won,

01:18:50.712 --> 01:18:52.589
if such a term may be applied.

01:18:54.361 --> 01:18:57.489
If I were wearing a hat,
I would take it off.

01:19:01.139 --> 01:19:02.807
Should we get on with it, then?

01:19:08.752 --> 01:19:11.463
Then keep your hat on, Schlomo.

01:19:16.155 --> 01:19:19.596
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

01:19:22.411 --> 01:19:23.871
Nice speech, though.

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.753
THE BOSS: I wish I was standing for it.

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.204
You-- you brought this upon our heads.

01:19:46.498 --> 01:19:47.749
- Me?
- You.

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:51.294
You hired Goodkat to kill my son.

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.736
After you murdered my son.

01:19:56.404 --> 01:19:57.864
I had no hand in that.

01:19:57.865 --> 01:19:59.324
Oh, sure.

01:19:59.324 --> 01:20:00.992
Just like in '84.

01:20:01.618 --> 01:20:03.599
I suppose you had
no hand in that, either.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.893
Just a finger, maybe.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.438
Time's up, Rabbi.

01:20:11.732 --> 01:20:15.173
Lying to a dead man is the same
as lying to yourself.

01:20:18.718 --> 01:20:20.908
You were getting too big.

01:20:22.889 --> 01:20:24.245
See...

01:20:25.809 --> 01:20:28.311
... problem when two men
are standing in a room

01:20:28.312 --> 01:20:31.127
is you can only look at one of them,
and they were looking at you,

01:20:31.128 --> 01:20:34.672
their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

01:20:37.487 --> 01:20:39.051
Then they called you The Boss.

01:20:41.763 --> 01:20:43.744
It was clear what had to be done.

01:20:50.522 --> 01:20:53.337
Try and appreciate
how it feels, Schlomo.

01:20:55.423 --> 01:20:59.594
To wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

01:21:00.532 --> 01:21:03.452
Lying in a pool
of your own blood and shit.

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:09.082
The dead eyes of your...

01:21:12.523 --> 01:21:16.173
... of your wife staring back at you.

01:21:19.197 --> 01:21:21.386
The only thing
keeping you from passing out

01:21:21.386 --> 01:21:25.036
is the sound of the footsteps
of the man going down the hall...

01:21:25.974 --> 01:21:27.643
... looking for your son.

01:21:33.066 --> 01:21:35.568
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

01:21:37.028 --> 01:21:38.071
And now...

01:21:39.947 --> 01:21:42.137
... after all these years...

01:21:44.118 --> 01:21:46.621
... in spite of our agreement,

01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:52.460
you... you fucking
backstabbing Philistine,

01:21:52.461 --> 01:21:54.963
you managed to
take my son away from me.

01:21:56.318 --> 01:21:57.361
Well...

01:21:59.446 --> 01:22:02.366
Now I've taken your son away from you.

01:22:02.367 --> 01:22:03.408
I told you,

01:22:03.408 --> 01:22:05.807
I had nothing to do with--

01:22:14.253 --> 01:22:15.504
You haven't heard.

01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:17.590
You are lying.

01:22:18.737 --> 01:22:20.614
Look at my face, Schlomo.

01:22:20.614 --> 01:22:22.595
Look at my smile.

01:22:24.368 --> 01:22:25.828
Your son is dead.

01:22:29.373 --> 01:22:31.250
Your son is dead.

01:22:34.378 --> 01:22:36.255
I'm gonna kill you.

01:22:37.089 --> 01:22:39.487
(laughs)

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:40.634
SLEVIN: Rabbi.

01:22:41.677 --> 01:22:43.971
Are you familiar with The Shmoo?

01:22:55.962 --> 01:22:57.422
THE BOSS: Fisher.

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.280
Fisher, listen to me.

01:23:04.929 --> 01:23:06.390
I already told you...

01:23:07.537 --> 01:23:08.893
I'm not Nick Fisher.

01:23:14.732 --> 01:23:16.609
Then who is Nick Fisher?

01:23:23.386 --> 01:23:25.680
I think you mean
who <i>was</i> Nick Fisher.

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:29.225
Fisher was the answer to a question.

01:23:29.955 --> 01:23:32.458
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

01:23:39.965 --> 01:23:41.529
SLEVIN:
<i>You get them to come to you. </i>

01:23:49.975 --> 01:23:52.686
<i>But to do that, I needed a name. </i>

01:23:53.626 --> 01:23:55.503
And where do you find names?

01:23:55.503 --> 01:23:56.754
<i>In books. </i>

01:24:01.968 --> 01:24:03.740
<i>And who has books?</i>

01:24:11.769 --> 01:24:13.750
<i>Well, your bookies have books. </i>

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:16.565
MAN: He's clean.

01:24:17.295 --> 01:24:19.172
<i>Crooked bookies. </i>

01:24:19.902 --> 01:24:21.258
BOOKIE: So...

01:24:21.259 --> 01:24:23.239
<i>Who work with big time crooks. </i>

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.377
<i>I was looking for a gambler. </i>

01:24:37.628 --> 01:24:39.192
<i>One who was in both books... </i>

01:24:40.026 --> 01:24:42.426
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column. </i>

01:24:42.738 --> 01:24:43.781
Got him.

01:24:43.885 --> 01:24:45.554
<i>That's when I found Nick Fisher. </i>

01:24:46.492 --> 01:24:49.308
<i>A lowlife that no one was gonna miss. </i>

01:24:50.559 --> 01:24:53.061
- 1729.
- Nick Fisher.

01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:55.459
Okay.

01:25:08.181 --> 01:25:09.640
GOODKAT: There was a time.

01:25:26.741 --> 01:25:29.139
All that was left to do
was make the phone ring.

01:25:49.473 --> 01:25:52.288
SLEVIN: <i>All I had to do</i>
<i>was pull the trigger</i>

01:25:52.289 --> 01:25:55.938
<i>and wait for you to call the man</i>
<i>who does the jobs that no one else wants. </i>

01:25:58.127 --> 01:26:00.213
THE BOSS:
I want an outsider brought in.

01:26:01.777 --> 01:26:03.341
There's a specialist.

01:26:06.156 --> 01:26:08.554
Calls himself Mr. Goodkat.

01:26:09.806 --> 01:26:12.412
(rings)

01:26:14.289 --> 01:26:15.645
Fine.

01:26:18.148 --> 01:26:20.338
Tell him he can expect me
in the morning.

01:26:24.405 --> 01:26:26.073
You ready?

01:26:27.011 --> 01:26:28.054
Yeah.

01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:33.789
There's just that one last thing.

01:26:35.874 --> 01:26:36.917
Uhh!

01:26:43.382 --> 01:26:44.946
THE BOSS: Mr. Goodkat...

01:26:45.363 --> 01:26:47.136
It's been a long time.

01:26:51.515 --> 01:26:53.600
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting, Mr. Goodkat,

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.477
so I'll get right down to business.

01:26:57.771 --> 01:27:02.359
Slim Hopkins, the man who
ran my book, was hit yesterday.

01:27:03.089 --> 01:27:05.280
And I guess
you've already heard about...

01:27:06.323 --> 01:27:07.678
... my son.

01:27:07.678 --> 01:27:09.034
Yes, I heard.

01:27:10.285 --> 01:27:12.579
I need you to sort it out for me.

01:27:12.579 --> 01:27:14.351
Who's the mark?

01:27:14.351 --> 01:27:16.020
Yitzchok.

01:27:19.044 --> 01:27:21.025
Yitzchok The Rabbi's son?

01:27:21.025 --> 01:27:23.006
Remember The Rabbi?

01:27:23.006 --> 01:27:24.987
I remember The Rabbi well.

01:27:25.091 --> 01:27:26.447
The thing is...

01:27:26.968 --> 01:27:29.679
... it can't look like a job.

01:27:30.305 --> 01:27:33.746
If Yitzchok gets hit,
The Rabbi will go to war.

01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:40.628
So I need you to make it look
like it ain't what it is.

01:27:41.566 --> 01:27:43.130
Can that be done?

01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.424
Anything can be done.

01:27:47.718 --> 01:27:48.969
Good.

01:27:49.491 --> 01:27:50.533
How?

01:27:50.533 --> 01:27:52.827
Kansas City Shuffle.

01:27:54.705 --> 01:27:56.478
I'm not familiar with the term.

01:27:59.293 --> 01:28:01.170
I'll need to see Slim's books.

01:28:02.213 --> 01:28:04.507
Slim's books were taken
when he was hit,

01:28:04.507 --> 01:28:07.218
but I do keep copies.

01:28:11.389 --> 01:28:12.953
What are you looking for?

01:28:17.123 --> 01:28:18.166
This is our guy.

01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:20.877
Nick, 1729.

01:28:23.067 --> 01:28:24.527
Nick Fisher.

01:28:24.527 --> 01:28:25.778
Why him?

01:28:26.821 --> 01:28:28.072
A loser.

01:28:29.219 --> 01:28:30.262
Pick him up.

01:28:30.366 --> 01:28:31.617
Bring him here.

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:41.732
MR. GOODKAT: Still not talking
to each other, huh?

01:28:41.732 --> 01:28:43.192
Can't say that I blame you.

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:45.695
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:49.031
I was under the impression
you no longer work New York.

01:28:49.031 --> 01:28:52.681
Like I said, very big job.

01:28:52.681 --> 01:28:57.060
And you thought as long as you're in town,
you drop by, see your old pal Schlomo.

01:28:57.061 --> 01:28:59.876
Say, "Hello! How 'bout them Yanks?"

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:02.378
(laughs)

01:29:02.378 --> 01:29:03.421
No.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:05.298
But something like that.

01:29:07.696 --> 01:29:09.051
Only problem

01:29:09.051 --> 01:29:11.450
is you and I aren't old friends.

01:29:11.451 --> 01:29:12.805
And I hate baseball.

01:29:12.805 --> 01:29:14.265
And since we're not friends

01:29:14.265 --> 01:29:16.350
and you hate baseball,
why the fuck are you here?

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:18.436
It's because we're not friends
that I'm here.

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:23.754
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

01:29:23.755 --> 01:29:26.048
'Cause that is right
at the top of my list of things

01:29:26.048 --> 01:29:27.716
that friends do not do to their friends.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:32.305
The good news for you
is my friendship is for sale.

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:36.371
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:37.935
than he does to The Boss dead,

01:29:37.935 --> 01:29:40.751
and more money means more to me
than less money.

01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:44.296
And you are the guy that sleeps
with all that green under your mattress.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:46.903
(whispers) I'm listening.

01:29:47.737 --> 01:29:49.405
You will pay me double
to kill The Boss

01:29:49.406 --> 01:29:51.595
what The Boss was
paying me to kill Yitzchok.

01:29:54.202 --> 01:29:55.453
That...

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.373
That will make us friends.

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:00.145
Right, Rabbi?

01:30:02.543 --> 01:30:04.003
Hmm?

01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:11.302
And since friends do favors for friends,

01:30:11.303 --> 01:30:12.866
you'll do a favor for me.

01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:14.013
Pray tell.

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:15.682
What is this favor?

01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:18.081
Concerns a matter of debt collection.

01:30:18.081 --> 01:30:19.541
One debt in particular.

01:30:19.541 --> 01:30:21.000
Whose?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.669
A flop from Benny's book.

01:30:22.773 --> 01:30:24.337
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

01:30:24.337 --> 01:30:25.693
Who is he?

01:30:26.214 --> 01:30:27.778
Just a loser.

01:30:27.882 --> 01:30:29.968
You just made a lot of money.

01:30:33.617 --> 01:30:36.328
And then I was free to come and go
as I pleased.

01:30:50.822 --> 01:30:51.865
Hmm?

01:30:51.969 --> 01:30:55.514
Whatever they're paying you.

01:30:59.998 --> 01:31:01.040
(laughs)

01:31:04.169 --> 01:31:05.525
There is no "they. "

01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:09.070
I did this to you.

01:31:12.824 --> 01:31:14.075
- Me.
- You?

01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:15.639
Me.

01:31:22.417 --> 01:31:23.981
Who are you?

01:31:27.318 --> 01:31:28.673
BRIKOWSKI: Who is he?

01:31:29.612 --> 01:31:33.574
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say that it's unlikely we'll ever know.

01:31:33.574 --> 01:31:35.555
What about dental records?

01:31:35.555 --> 01:31:38.058
Sure. As soon as you find
the bottom half of the jaw.

01:31:38.058 --> 01:31:40.769
Then all we need to do is find out
who the dentist was.

01:31:42.333 --> 01:31:44.210
What a fucking mess.

01:31:45.357 --> 01:31:47.859
MARTY: <i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty. </i>
<i>You there?</i>

01:31:47.859 --> 01:31:51.196
<i>We found two more bodies to go along</i>
<i>with the two you already got. </i>

01:31:52.343 --> 01:31:53.595
All right, I'll be right over.

01:31:54.221 --> 01:31:55.785
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi

01:31:55.889 --> 01:31:58.496
so he could get down here
and identify what's left of his kid?

01:31:58.497 --> 01:32:00.894
<i>Negative. We've been calling</i>
<i>for the last hour. </i>

01:32:00.894 --> 01:32:01.937
<i>No answer. </i>

01:32:01.937 --> 01:32:03.709
Send somebody over.

01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:04.856
<i>Copy. </i>

01:32:06.837 --> 01:32:09.757
You all right?
You look a little shook up.

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.321
No, I'm fine.

01:32:12.259 --> 01:32:13.302
All right.

01:32:28.317 --> 01:32:31.341
(phone rings)

01:32:33.426 --> 01:32:36.033
(phone rings)

01:32:37.284 --> 01:32:38.431
Yeah.

01:32:38.431 --> 01:32:40.726
MAN: <i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy. </i>

01:32:40.726 --> 01:32:42.186
Hey, Murph.
What's up?

01:32:42.186 --> 01:32:45.627
<i>Harry Kello came by today. </i>
<i>You remember Harry. </i>

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:47.608
Retired a few years ago,
his wife just died,

01:32:47.608 --> 01:32:50.007
so he likes to come in
a couple times a week, talk shop,

01:32:50.007 --> 01:32:51.571
tell bedtime stories to the rooks,

01:32:51.675 --> 01:32:54.490
starts every sentence
with "the way things used to be. "

01:32:54.491 --> 01:32:55.429
Guy living in the past.

01:32:55.533 --> 01:32:56.784
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about him?

01:32:56.888 --> 01:33:00.121
Anyway, we're making small talk,
guy says he can't complain,

01:33:00.122 --> 01:33:01.893
then all he does is fucking complain.

01:33:01.893 --> 01:33:03.353
<i>His dead wife, </i>

01:33:03.457 --> 01:33:05.439
<i>the leg he got shot in, </i>
<i>his crappy pension, </i>

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.984
but then he stops when he sees
the picture Marty snapped of your kid.

01:33:08.985 --> 01:33:10.339
Just stares at it.

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:12.320
I say, "What is it?
You know the kid?"

01:33:13.155 --> 01:33:15.761
Thing is he ain't looking at the picture,
he's looking at the name,

01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:17.534
'cause I got it written down
at the bottom.

01:33:17.534 --> 01:33:19.515
He knows that name Slevin.

01:33:39.745 --> 01:33:41.413
I have that same phone.

01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:56.324
MURPHY: <i>About an hour later, </i>
<i>the phone rings. </i>

01:33:56.324 --> 01:33:58.409
<i>It's Harry. He's talking like</i>
<i>a goddamned machine gun, </i>

01:33:58.409 --> 01:34:01.016
going on and on
about a horserace back in '79.

01:34:04.353 --> 01:34:05.917
SLEVIN: Aqueduct.

01:34:06.959 --> 01:34:09.253
7 horse, tenth race.
Ring a bell?

01:34:09.253 --> 01:34:11.860
(starting bell rings)

01:34:16.866 --> 01:34:20.099
MURPHY: <i>It was</i>
<i>a drugstore handicap, big windup, </i>

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:23.122
<i>around the time The Boss</i>
<i>and the Rabbi set up shop in New York, </i>

01:34:23.122 --> 01:34:26.355
<i>before people started waking up</i>
<i>with knives in their backs. </i>

01:34:26.356 --> 01:34:31.256
Anyway, he goes on
about this local legend about this kid.

01:34:31.257 --> 01:34:33.237
His name was Max.

01:34:33.862 --> 01:34:35.114
Come on, come on.

01:34:35.739 --> 01:34:39.702
SLEVIN: Max placed a bet
with a bookie named Roth.

01:34:39.703 --> 01:34:43.664
Roth laid the bet off... on you...

01:34:53.778 --> 01:34:54.925
... and you.

01:35:01.494 --> 01:35:04.415
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

01:35:04.415 --> 01:35:06.709
well, they are the opposite of happy.

01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:10.462
Word comes down
an example is to be made.

01:35:11.401 --> 01:35:13.069
These guys kill everyone.

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:14.946
And I mean everyone.

01:35:15.572 --> 01:35:19.013
Max, his wife, his kid, Roth.

01:35:19.014 --> 01:35:20.890
Even the goddamn horse died.

01:35:20.891 --> 01:35:22.454
These guys went to town
with a tomahawk.

01:35:22.558 --> 01:35:24.122
It was a fuckin' massacre.

01:35:25.999 --> 01:35:28.084
<i>They had to bring in a specialist</i>
<i>to do the kid</i>

01:35:28.084 --> 01:35:29.961
<i>'cause nobody would take the job. </i>

01:35:48.313 --> 01:35:50.815
What've you done with my son?

01:36:06.978 --> 01:36:08.125
You?

01:36:09.272 --> 01:36:10.941
No.

01:36:10.941 --> 01:36:12.713
You're dead.

01:36:14.799 --> 01:36:16.258
THE BOSS: You're dead!

01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:24.392
MURPHY: So, Harry's going on

01:36:24.392 --> 01:36:27.728
about how they had to bring in
a specialist to kill the kid,

01:36:27.728 --> 01:36:29.084
but I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says,

01:36:29.084 --> 01:36:31.691
"Harry, what does any of this
have to do with the case?"

01:36:31.692 --> 01:36:33.984
<i>He says, "The horse's name. "</i>

01:36:33.984 --> 01:36:36.383
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

01:36:36.383 --> 01:36:40.972
<i>He says, "The horse's name</i>
<i>was Lucky Number Slevin. "</i>

01:36:40.973 --> 01:36:41.910
What is your name?

01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:43.578
Slevin Kelevra.

01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:54.006
You remember this part?

01:37:04.537 --> 01:37:06.309
MAX: Please!

01:37:06.309 --> 01:37:08.291
I have a family!

01:37:08.292 --> 01:37:09.959
THE BOSS: Not anymore you don't.

01:37:09.959 --> 01:37:11.002
MAX: Henry!

01:37:13.817 --> 01:37:16.319
You fucking bastards!

01:37:18.301 --> 01:37:21.116
You fucking bastard!

01:37:22.159 --> 01:37:25.183
(Max screaming)

01:37:40.511 --> 01:37:42.805
The two of you
killed everything I ever loved.

01:37:48.436 --> 01:37:49.687
Fuck you both.

01:38:14.712 --> 01:38:20.135
MURPHY: <i>Now, there is no such person</i>
<i>as Slevin Kelevra, as far as I can tell, </i>

01:38:20.136 --> 01:38:22.221
<i>which means the kid</i>
<i>was using a pseudonym, </i>

01:38:22.221 --> 01:38:25.557
<i>which is kind of interesting, </i>
<i>him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

01:38:25.558 --> 01:38:27.539
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

01:38:27.539 --> 01:38:30.875
seeing as how they had some involvement
with that very same horse.

01:38:30.875 --> 01:38:33.691
<i>I thought to myself, you know, </i>
<i>maybe it means something. </i>

01:38:33.692 --> 01:38:38.174
<i>Then again, maybe it's just a coincidence. </i>
<i>Name gotta come from someplace, right?</i>

01:38:38.696 --> 01:38:42.449
<i>I guess none of this really matters</i>
<i>now that the kid's gone cold. </i>

01:38:47.663 --> 01:38:49.227
<i>Ah, one more thing. </i>

01:38:49.227 --> 01:38:51.417
<i>We got a new guy in the precinct. </i>

01:38:51.417 --> 01:38:54.128
<i>Jewish fella--</i>
<i>funny little guy, talks a lot. </i>

01:38:55.275 --> 01:39:00.801
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested, </i>
<i>he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew. </i>

01:39:00.802 --> 01:39:02.886
<i>Says it means... </i>

01:39:02.886 --> 01:39:03.929
Bad dog.

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.253
BRIKOWSKI: Twenty years ago,
he used to be my bookie.

01:39:14.357 --> 01:39:16.547
I used to send my paychecks
over to him.

01:39:32.605 --> 01:39:34.064
Brikowski, you there?

01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:30.955
GOODKAT: Your girl made me.

01:41:32.728 --> 01:41:34.396
She took my picture.

01:41:36.273 --> 01:41:38.254
She's gotta go in the ground.

01:41:40.444 --> 01:41:41.799
Okay.

01:42:02.862 --> 01:42:05.052
(whispers) I have something
I have to tell you.

01:42:07.658 --> 01:42:09.640
He told me that we needed to kill you.

01:42:14.749 --> 01:42:16.523
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:42:28.826 --> 01:42:30.808
Shit.

01:42:32.997 --> 01:42:34.874
He's gonna shoot you here.

01:43:33.058 --> 01:43:35.144
I didn't think you'd understand.

01:43:52.349 --> 01:43:54.226
I'd have understood.

01:43:58.919 --> 01:44:00.378
How'd you find out about us?

01:44:01.213 --> 01:44:02.881
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

01:44:03.819 --> 01:44:05.488
How do you think I found out?

01:44:09.033 --> 01:44:10.910
I thought you might want this.

01:44:50.846 --> 01:44:52.515
I wanna go home.

01:44:52.515 --> 01:44:55.434
Neither of us is going home
for a long time, kid.

01:44:59.084 --> 01:45:00.961
My name is Goodkat.

01:45:02.212 --> 01:45:03.985
You can call me Mr. Goodkat.

01:45:03.985 --> 01:45:07.530
DJ: <i>And it's 20 minutes past 4:00</i>
<i>here at WLNS, </i>

01:45:09.198 --> 01:45:11.909
<i>and here's my new favorite song by JR--</i>
<i>"The Kansas City Shuffle. "</i>

01:45:11.909 --> 01:45:16.393
MAN: # It's a blindfold kick back type
of game called the Kansas City Shuffle #

01:45:16.394 --> 01:45:20.877
# Where some look left, they fall right
into the Kansas City Shuffle #

01:45:20.878 --> 01:45:25.360
# It's a they think, you think, you don't know
type of Kansas City Hustle #
