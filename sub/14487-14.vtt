WEBVTT

00:35.203 --> 00:36.103
( buzzer sounds )

00:36.204 --> 00:37.570
$10, please.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.207
Oh, man.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.380
Sleep, little dumpling.

00:46.479 --> 00:49.383
I have replaced your mother!

00:49.482 --> 00:50.917
( mechanical whirring )

00:53.253 --> 00:54.722
Aww.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.158
Oh, my God!

00:57.258 --> 00:58.491
Robot deely-boppers!

00:58.591 --> 01:00.594
And there's a robot
scratching post!

01:00.694 --> 01:03.164
FRY:
You should try it out, Bender.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.498
Please, I have
some dignity.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.268
( deely-boppers sproinging )

01:07.367 --> 01:08.668
Ladies and gentlemen

01:08.769 --> 01:11.905
my killbot features Lotus Notes
and a machine gun.

01:12.004 --> 01:13.740
It is the finest available.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.676
Like fun it is,
you glass-headed wallaby!

01:16.777 --> 01:18.010
No one calls me that!

01:18.111 --> 01:19.347
I'm having at you!

01:19.447 --> 01:21.013
Wernstrom!

01:21.114 --> 01:23.484
( grunting and yelling )

01:25.453 --> 01:27.420
Such senseless aggression.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.424
Come on, let's go
for a paddleboat ride.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.262
( grunting excitedly )

01:38.998 --> 01:42.002
The secret was scratching
really, really hard!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.936
( gulping )

01:44.037 --> 01:49.543
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the woman who "Mom"-
opolizes the robot industry...

01:49.643 --> 01:51.311
MAN IN AUDIENCE:
I get it!

01:53.514 --> 01:55.948
MAN 2:
Oh, now I get it.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.688
Hello, dearies.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.022
( crowd cheering )

02:03.123 --> 02:05.192
MAN 3:
Whoo! I love that old bat!

02:05.293 --> 02:08.961
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the 17th year in a row

02:09.062 --> 02:11.399
the future of robotics
has arrived.

02:11.498 --> 02:12.566
Boys?

02:14.967 --> 02:18.205
I give you... Robot 1-X!

02:20.341 --> 02:21.908
Ow!

02:22.009 --> 02:23.211
Oh.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.812
( crowd oohing and aahing )

02:24.912 --> 02:26.546
( camera shutters clicking )

02:26.646 --> 02:28.048
Neat.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.016
Quite frankly, Robot 1-X

02:30.116 --> 02:33.253
will put all my previous
models to shame.

02:33.353 --> 02:37.525
Incidentally, would one
of my previous models
mind coming up here?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.026
Right here.
I'm coming.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.694
Come on, baby.
I'll do it.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.195
Jerk.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.697
( grunts )

02:43.796 --> 02:46.266
I'm your top-of-the-line, Mom.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.235
( gulping )

02:47.335 --> 02:49.670
Notice that this
obsolete robot

02:49.770 --> 02:52.372
runs on alcohol
and emits pollution

02:52.473 --> 02:55.442
whereas Robot 1-X
runs on pollution

02:55.543 --> 02:59.546
and emits pure oxygen
with a fresh pine scent.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.248
( huge belch )

03:01.348 --> 03:02.550
( suction noise )

03:02.650 --> 03:03.950
( quiet air hiss )

03:04.050 --> 03:06.787
Man, that smells great!

03:06.887 --> 03:11.425
Now let's see how both robots
do at a typical household task:

03:11.525 --> 03:13.693
sorting a jar of pocket change.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.266
Task completed.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.936
Total value: four dollars,
73 cents and one Albanian Lek.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.272
Very good, Robot 1-X.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.275
And you, bending unit?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.276
Uh, I never
got the change.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.610
( sneaky chuckle )

03:30.711 --> 03:31.944
( sotto voce ):
Suckers.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.248
Presenting
Mom's Friendly Robots!

03:35.348 --> 03:36.449
Ow!

03:38.551 --> 03:39.620
( applause and cheers )

03:39.719 --> 03:41.421
That new robot
is great, huh?

03:41.521 --> 03:43.990
He sure made me look
like a pile of crap.

03:44.091 --> 03:48.161
Indeed. That's why
I bought one to help
around the office.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.497
( gasping )

03:51.831 --> 03:53.066
Let's try him out.

03:53.165 --> 03:56.670
Robot 1-X, can you clean
Nibbler's stanky litter box?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.406
I can and will.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.780
Hey, I could've done that
if you'd asked me!

04:06.879 --> 04:09.181
I asked you
five minutes ago.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.118
( kissing sound )

04:13.086 --> 04:14.587
You call that a kiss?

04:14.687 --> 04:15.622
I'll show you!

04:15.723 --> 04:16.524
Come here, Nibbler!

04:16.624 --> 04:18.024
( loud kissing noises )

04:18.125 --> 04:19.427
( Nibbler chittering )

04:19.526 --> 04:22.329
Oh, look, Bender,
if you want something to do

04:22.430 --> 04:24.598
stop making out
and give us a hand.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.766
Here. Go up on the roof

04:25.865 --> 04:27.634
and install
this fake satellite dish

04:27.735 --> 04:29.370
so we can impress the neighbors.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.271
Yes, sir! I'm on it!

04:31.372 --> 04:33.273
Oh, and have Robot 1-X
help you.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.807
Gah!

04:34.908 --> 04:37.043
( droning )

04:39.045 --> 04:40.713
Get out of here, freshman!

04:40.814 --> 04:42.281
I don't need your help.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.384
Our owners asked me
to assist you.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.519
Yeah? Well, assist this!

04:46.620 --> 04:47.521
( grunts )

04:47.620 --> 04:49.523
( yelling )

04:49.622 --> 04:51.959
Heeeelp!!

04:54.127 --> 04:55.194
( growls )

04:55.295 --> 04:57.465
When I screamed help,
I didn't mean you!

04:57.564 --> 04:58.632
I apologize.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.367
However, I was able
to do your job

05:00.468 --> 05:01.834
before I saved your life.

05:05.038 --> 05:09.343
( loud clunking )

05:09.442 --> 05:10.711
Don't mind me.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.913
I'm just saving you the trouble
of throwing me away.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.016
Spleesh! Mell out, Bender.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.485
Come watch some TV.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.853
( grunting )

05:19.952 --> 05:22.656
I can't; I'm stuck in the can.

05:22.755 --> 05:25.692
Well, ask Robot 1-X
to pull you out.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.326
Never!

05:29.262 --> 05:30.863
Why can't you accept his help?

05:30.963 --> 05:31.865
I hate him!

05:31.964 --> 05:33.165
But he's just a tool

05:33.266 --> 05:34.901
to make your life easier.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.103
Like a socket wrench
or a burglar's kit.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.242
I can't ask for
his help because...

05:42.341 --> 05:43.543
Yes?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.545
( whispering ):
I'm scared of him.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.548
( cracking up )

05:48.649 --> 05:49.882
Oh, sorry.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.420
Well, then, there's
only one solution.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.588
You need an upgrade
to make you

05:54.687 --> 05:57.691
compatible with Robot
1-X's new technology.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.026
( gasping ):
An upgrade?!

05:59.125 --> 06:01.394
But I thought we all agreed
I was perfect!

06:01.495 --> 06:03.262
Fry, didn't we agree
I was perfect?

06:03.362 --> 06:05.264
Oh, yeah, no,
you're pretty perfect.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.401
Pretty perfect?

06:07.500 --> 06:10.471
So, you do think
I need an upgrade.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.540
Yes, for God's sakes, yes!

06:12.639 --> 06:16.309
Fine. I'll be back
in a few days.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.223
Man, I hate
those new 1-X robots.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.659
I'd like to stab 'em.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.261
Give 'em some of these!

06:34.360 --> 06:37.064
( grunting and yelling )

06:37.163 --> 06:38.966
Yeah! Right on, nutcake!

06:39.066 --> 06:40.933
Parole officer says
I got to upgrade

06:41.033 --> 06:43.336
or he won't give me
back my stabbin' knife.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.504
But it's no big.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.305
I bate those 1-Xs so much

06:46.406 --> 06:48.240
I know it won't affect me.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.747
Death to the 1-X robots!

06:54.848 --> 06:56.917
( electrical crackling )

06:58.350 --> 07:01.622
I love those magnificent
1-X robots!

07:01.721 --> 07:04.024
The 1-X robots are my friends.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.492
W-W-Wait! What happened

07:05.593 --> 07:07.528
to your enthusiasm
for stabbing them?

07:07.627 --> 07:08.829
I'm past that.

07:08.928 --> 07:09.997
Later, blood!

07:10.096 --> 07:12.665
It's like he's
not him anymore.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.134
You took away
his robo-humanity!

07:17.204 --> 07:19.005
( mechanical whirring )

07:19.105 --> 07:20.473
( electrical crackling )
( screaming )

07:22.108 --> 07:23.511
I changed my mind!

07:32.052 --> 07:33.853
( Bender screaming in distance )

07:33.954 --> 07:35.322
( scream grows louder )

07:35.422 --> 07:36.322
Ooh!

07:36.423 --> 07:38.225
( shorebirds squawking )

07:38.324 --> 07:40.994
Yeah, I did it!

07:41.093 --> 07:42.495
I escaped!

07:42.596 --> 07:44.497
But to what kind of a life?

07:44.598 --> 07:45.566
( loud squawk )

07:45.665 --> 07:48.034
I'm too scared
to get the upgrade

07:48.134 --> 07:51.471
but I can't face my friends
again without it.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.574
( sobbing )

08:02.182 --> 08:06.887
And so, I set sail
for unknown shores.

08:06.987 --> 08:12.091
Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity
on this mechanical mariner!

08:12.192 --> 08:14.728
( thunder rumbling )

08:14.827 --> 08:17.197
Oh, geez.

08:19.365 --> 08:22.702
( thunder crashing )

08:26.406 --> 08:29.576
( screaming )

08:29.677 --> 08:32.779
Curse you, merciful Poseidon!

08:45.893 --> 08:49.596
Boy, what is the deal
with the ocean?

08:49.697 --> 08:52.532
A tropical island, huh?

08:52.633 --> 08:55.702
Well, I've washed up
in worse places.

08:55.802 --> 08:59.072
Okay, first up, I'm gonna
need to build a shelter.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.044
There.

09:05.144 --> 09:08.447
Well, I guess
I'll go out for a while.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.957
Damn! One rock short of rescue.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.570
( foghorn sound )

09:30.671 --> 09:33.640
( foghorn sound )

09:33.740 --> 09:35.842
( foghorn sound sputters )

09:35.942 --> 09:37.845
Oop, low on power.

09:37.945 --> 09:38.846
( chuckles )

09:38.946 --> 09:40.513
Better fuel up.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.349
Ah, no!

09:42.448 --> 09:45.686
Guess I'll do what I always do
when I run out of booze.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.755
( wailing sobs )

09:54.695 --> 09:56.629
Okay, don't panic.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.030
I've got these yams.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.332
I'll just make
some yam schnapps.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.804
Hmm...

10:07.307 --> 10:09.341
( bees buzzing )

10:10.309 --> 10:11.678
( angry snort )

10:11.778 --> 10:13.846
Hey, I should be mad at you!

10:13.947 --> 10:15.548
Now turn around.

10:15.649 --> 10:19.886
( drunken muttering )

10:19.986 --> 10:22.621
( gibbering )

10:22.722 --> 10:24.390
( Bender gasps )

10:24.490 --> 10:25.793
Beer!

10:28.995 --> 10:31.130
( straining )

10:31.230 --> 10:32.032
( quacks )

10:32.131 --> 10:33.299
Ow!

10:34.500 --> 10:36.135
( clunk )

10:36.235 --> 10:38.038
( whir and clunk )

10:40.807 --> 10:42.042
( weak moans )

10:42.142 --> 10:45.712
( worried muttering )

10:45.812 --> 10:49.015
( jungle drums beating )

10:49.115 --> 10:51.884
( rhythmic chanting )

10:51.985 --> 10:53.419
Ow!

10:53.519 --> 10:56.823
( mechanical screeching )
( cymbal banging )

11:03.864 --> 11:06.899
( gagging )

11:09.836 --> 11:11.938
Who are you
and why should I care?

11:16.408 --> 11:19.611
Side A: We're a community
of outdated robots

11:19.712 --> 11:22.548
who refused to upgrade
and came here;

11:22.649 --> 11:25.451
Side B: ...to live
a simpler existence

11:25.552 --> 11:26.720
free of technology.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.188
A working cartridge unit?

11:29.288 --> 11:31.792
Wow, you guys went obsolete
years ago.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.062
Your mother.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.364
What Cartridge Unit means

11:37.463 --> 11:39.466
is the very things
that make us obsolete

11:39.566 --> 11:40.868
also make us unique.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.770
I, for example, need to keep
refilling my water wheel

11:43.870 --> 11:45.437
or I'll power down forever.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.605
( creaks )

11:46.706 --> 11:48.975
Oh, God,
I'll never make it this time!

11:49.076 --> 11:50.710
This is the end!

11:52.379 --> 11:54.114
Anyway, we like it here.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.115
Like you have a choice.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.317
So what's your problem?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.251
Not enough...

11:59.351 --> 12:00.253
Memory?

12:00.352 --> 12:02.389
Oh, great.
Now I remember that word

12:02.489 --> 12:04.157
but I forgot my wife's face.

12:04.256 --> 12:08.061
Oh, God, no!
I want to live!

12:08.160 --> 12:09.296
( water splashing )

12:09.395 --> 12:13.432
If you'd like,
you're welcome
to join our society.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.600
Look, no offense

12:14.701 --> 12:15.969
but I need technology

12:16.068 --> 12:18.171
especially e-mail
and snowmobiles

12:18.270 --> 12:19.172
and television.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.340
Without television

12:20.440 --> 12:22.174
how will I know
what's buzz-worthy?

12:22.274 --> 12:23.844
Why would you want to watch TV

12:23.943 --> 12:26.613
when you can watch a snail crawl
for hours on end?

12:26.712 --> 12:29.615
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

12:32.684 --> 12:36.088
Oh, man, he's never going to
make it over that next pebble.

12:36.188 --> 12:37.690
Wait... wait...

12:37.790 --> 12:39.025
Oh, my God! He made it!

12:39.125 --> 12:40.027
Yeah, way to go!

12:40.126 --> 12:41.094
Woo-hoo!

12:41.193 --> 12:42.962
That was
the greatest thing ever.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.030
Let's party.

12:46.866 --> 12:47.700
* I'm all right

12:47.801 --> 12:48.869
( humming along )

12:48.969 --> 12:51.104
* Nobody's worried about me...

12:51.203 --> 12:52.504
Yeah, baby, come on!

12:52.605 --> 12:53.841
Where did you
get that CD?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.875
It's one of my ten
desert island discs.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.110
I never really thought
I'd get to use them

12:58.211 --> 12:59.379
but look at me now.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.014
* Ooh, yeah, baby,
do-do that dance *

13:02.115 --> 13:03.350
* Do-do-do-do-
do-do-do-do... *

13:03.450 --> 13:04.851
CDs are unnatural.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.854
Why don't you just listen
to the ocean?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.687
Which ocean? That ocean?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.892
( surf roaring )

13:11.991 --> 13:15.562
Wow. It's like the Earth making
sweet, salty love to itself

13:15.662 --> 13:17.663
while all the fish groove on it.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.833
So much for this garbage.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.470
( grunting )

13:23.570 --> 13:26.338
Take that, Beethoven,
you deaf bastard.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.376
Bang, bang, bang.

13:30.476 --> 13:34.213
You sure got this
life thing figured out,
cymbal-banging monkey.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.883
Hi, Bender.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.484
We know how much
you miss technology

13:37.584 --> 13:39.519
so we brought you this
washing machine

13:39.619 --> 13:40.552
that drifted ashore.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.221
( gasps )

13:44.356 --> 13:47.894
Ooh, I'm going to wash
my linen so hard...

13:55.567 --> 13:58.105
( chirping )

13:58.205 --> 14:00.706
( snorting )

14:03.110 --> 14:05.378
( grunting )

14:05.477 --> 14:07.547
( water splashing )

14:11.551 --> 14:13.753
I don't understand.
Huh?

14:13.852 --> 14:15.956
Wretched technology
has brought me

14:16.056 --> 14:17.289
nothing but misery.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.695
But, Bender,
you are a technology.

14:22.794 --> 14:25.432
You're the most advanced thing
on this entire island.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.633
Oh, it's true.

14:26.732 --> 14:30.437
I am a hideous triumph
of form and function...

14:30.537 --> 14:33.373
but not for long.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.042
( banging )
BENDER:
Ow! Ooh! Ee!

14:35.142 --> 14:36.143
Oh, my ass!

14:36.243 --> 14:37.576
Oh! Ow, that hurts.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.979
Oh, ooh...

14:40.779 --> 14:42.982
LISA:
The downgrade is complete.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.990
Behold my handcrafted purity.

14:50.090 --> 14:54.394
The modern world can bite
my splintery, wooden ass.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.895
Ah...

14:56.996 --> 15:00.267
Welcome to your new life
of simple tranquillity.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.168
( blows raspberry ):
Forget that.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.471
I say the whole world must learn
of our peaceful ways...

15:05.572 --> 15:06.974
by force.

15:07.073 --> 15:07.807
( all gasp )

15:09.841 --> 15:11.278
What?!

15:11.378 --> 15:13.745
We're going back
to civilization

15:13.846 --> 15:15.782
to wage war
on technology!

15:15.881 --> 15:18.451
What?!

15:22.422 --> 15:25.357
( surf roaring )

15:27.927 --> 15:30.129
BENDER:
Row, comrades, row!

15:30.230 --> 15:32.465
We'll soon stage an attack
on technology

15:32.565 --> 15:35.668
worthy of being chronicled
in an anthem by Rush.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.870
We've been sailing
for three weeks.

15:37.971 --> 15:41.207
Maybe I should check
our position with the periscope.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.143
Aye-yo!

15:43.243 --> 15:46.013
Mirrors reflecting mirrors!

15:46.113 --> 15:47.647
Hi-tech sorcery!

15:47.746 --> 15:48.947
Sorcery, I say!

15:49.048 --> 15:52.019
( grunting )

15:53.519 --> 15:54.553
Did you see anything?

15:54.653 --> 15:56.188
Yep, we're there.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.856
Prepare to surface!

16:02.361 --> 16:06.365
And now technology shall taste
the lash of the hickory switch!

16:23.482 --> 16:25.251
( grunts )

16:25.351 --> 16:26.753
( grunting )

16:42.701 --> 16:45.272
( kids crying )

16:45.371 --> 16:46.505
( chuckles )

16:48.607 --> 16:50.376
Technology is defeated.

16:50.476 --> 16:53.679
Let us return to the island
and celebrate by counting rocks.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.715
Yes!
Yay!

16:55.815 --> 16:57.183
Whoa, whoa.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.086
No one wants
to count rocks
more than me

16:59.186 --> 17:01.187
but our mission
is not complete.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.022
Not so long as Robot 1-X
torments me

17:04.124 --> 17:05.692
with his obvious superiority.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.727
Ready the catapult,
Sinclair!

17:11.631 --> 17:13.099
BENDER:
Aim for their power lines.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.134
They're the devil's veins

17:15.234 --> 17:17.369
and electricity is his blood.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.073
Bender, if we don't survive
the attack

17:20.173 --> 17:22.108
I want you to know I love you.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.242
Okay, fine.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.111
Fire!

17:29.915 --> 17:32.384
Oh, I'm blind!

17:32.484 --> 17:34.121
Professor,
we have no power.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.822
What do you mean,
no power?

17:35.922 --> 17:37.490
We're living
in the future.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.991
I'd better light some candles.

17:43.262 --> 17:47.267
Friends, I've come to free you
from your complicated lives!

17:47.366 --> 17:50.068
Free you from the
complicated part,
I mean

17:50.170 --> 17:51.403
not the lives part.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.673
Oh, Lord, he's made of wood.

17:53.772 --> 17:54.973
What now, Bender?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.343
I got a downgrade.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.744
I'm a steam-powered
wooden robot

17:58.845 --> 18:00.613
just as nature intended.

18:00.712 --> 18:03.583
Therefore, I must kill
Robot 1-X.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.152
That's just stupid.

18:05.251 --> 18:10.257
Does Mr. Bender wish me
to destroy myself?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.491
I don't need your charity.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.693
Target Robot 1-X and fire.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.694
( catapult clacks )

18:15.795 --> 18:19.365
( stone whistling )

18:27.207 --> 18:30.477
You wanged my ship,
you walnut-paneled idiot!

18:30.576 --> 18:32.345
Try again, Sinclair!

18:32.444 --> 18:34.614
I said target Robot 1-X.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.115
Who's Robot 1-X? Launching!

18:36.215 --> 18:37.150
( catapult clacks )

18:37.250 --> 18:40.952
( stone whistling )

18:41.052 --> 18:45.525
So, I guess everything
worked out fine.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.160
( screaming )

18:49.528 --> 18:50.730
( all yelling )

18:50.829 --> 18:53.400
Great, now we're being crushed.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.405
Help us, wooden Bender!

19:04.977 --> 19:06.578
Ah! Those guys hate fire!

19:06.679 --> 19:08.079
I got to do something.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.025
What the...? Termites?!

19:19.125 --> 19:21.528
Well, I don't need legs
to save my friends.

19:21.627 --> 19:24.029
I'll just use
the old extenso-matic arms.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.602
Bender, hurry!
This fuel's expensive!

19:29.701 --> 19:31.403
Also, we're dying!

19:31.503 --> 19:33.373
I'm a-coming.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.741
( grunting )

19:41.347 --> 19:44.550
Ow! Lousy primitive body!

19:44.651 --> 19:47.185
Oh, why didn't I get
that upgrade?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.556
I'm an outdated piece of junk.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.423
Sir, might I recommend...?

19:51.523 --> 19:52.858
You shut up!

19:52.959 --> 19:55.728
No, wait. I can use you
as a tool to save my friends

19:55.827 --> 19:57.297
and I'll still be the hero

19:57.396 --> 19:59.432
who everyone says
how great he was.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.732
How may I help you?

20:00.833 --> 20:03.134
Ah! Save my friends!

20:03.236 --> 20:04.804
Ah! And Zoidberg!

20:04.903 --> 20:07.773
( whirring )

20:07.874 --> 20:10.041
( whooshing )

20:15.281 --> 20:16.449
( all sigh )

20:16.548 --> 20:20.287
Look, my hair got singed
into an even cuter do.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.887
Hey, where's Bender?

20:21.988 --> 20:22.954
Down here.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.223
( gasps )

20:25.325 --> 20:26.558
I'm so sorry, guys.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.327
I never meant to hurt you.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.096
Just to destroy everything
you ever believed in.

20:31.196 --> 20:34.267
Well, at least you saved us
from... uh... you.

20:34.366 --> 20:37.836
Thank God you finally overcame
your incompatibility

20:37.936 --> 20:38.971
with Robot 1-X.

20:39.070 --> 20:41.173
Oh, yeah,
we were totally in sync.

20:41.273 --> 20:42.909
I was, like, "Save them."

20:43.009 --> 20:44.676
And he was all, "No problem."

20:44.777 --> 20:45.978
And then he did it.

20:46.077 --> 20:47.447
This new technology is great.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.517
I love those
magnificent 1-X robots.

20:50.616 --> 20:53.085
The 1-X robots are my friends.

20:53.184 --> 20:56.423
It's like his personality
is totally different now.

20:56.522 --> 20:59.459
Oh, maybe this upgrade
isn't such a good idea.

20:59.558 --> 21:03.363
I'd like to give Robot 1-X
a big smooch on the...

21:03.462 --> 21:05.196
Hey, what's the dealio?

21:05.298 --> 21:06.465
Your upgrade is complete.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.035
But I destroyed the technology
of the world.

21:09.134 --> 21:12.338
I ran on the beach and felt
the sand between my footcups.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.707
Everyone experiences the upgrade
differently.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.143
Woof. If that stuff
wasn't real

21:17.242 --> 21:19.878
how can I be sure
anything is real?

21:19.979 --> 21:22.382
Is it not possible--
nay, probable--

21:22.481 --> 21:25.151
that my whole life
is just a product

21:25.250 --> 21:27.819
of my or someone else's
imagination?

21:27.920 --> 21:30.056
No. Get out. Next.

21:38.865 --> 21:42.669
Well, I guess reality
is what you make of it.

21:42.769 --> 21:46.005
( happy whistling )

21:46.105 --> 21:48.875
Yep. Oh, thanks, baby.
