00:23.481 --> 00:25.984
An intact tomb is like a time capsule.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.988
Filled with spells and curses

00:30.071 --> 00:31.906
that protect the dead.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.662
Undisturbed for thousands of years,

00:38.830 --> 00:41.166
we are the first people to go inside.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.963
The past is sleeping in the darkness,

00:47.672 --> 00:49.215
waiting to be found.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.220
You are looking at a woman,

00:54.304 --> 00:57.849
dated back 4,300 years ago.

00:59.350 --> 01:03.271
Over 1,000 years older than King Tut.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.984
Imagine if I could talk to the mummy.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.238
And the mummy could talk to me.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.547
I'm hunting for a pyramid lost to history.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.639
I am not immortal.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.684
But my name will be remembered.

02:04.040 --> 02:04.958
Beautiful.

02:45.081 --> 02:48.918
Saqqara, in my opinion,

02:49.002 --> 02:54.591
is the most magical
and important site in Egypt.

02:57.302 --> 03:02.348
It has been explored by many foreign
expeditions for the last two centuries.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.352
They discovered pyramids and tombs.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.982
The oldest pyramid.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.111
The Step Pyramid.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.869
And there is more to be discovered.

03:26.831 --> 03:31.252
There is one area at Saqqara
no one has ever excavated.

03:35.798 --> 03:38.051
A patch of open desert,

03:39.636 --> 03:40.720
Gisr el-Mudir.

03:42.805 --> 03:47.310
Only 30% of the treasures
of ancient Egypt have been uncovered.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.480
Tombs, temples, even pyramids.

03:51.564 --> 03:56.027
More than 70%
are still hidden beneath the sand.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.701
I have been thinking
about this place for decades.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.582
I always come out here alone.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.630
And I ask myself the question,

04:16.464 --> 04:18.424
"What could be under this place

04:19.259 --> 04:21.010
that we've never touched?"

04:31.479 --> 04:34.774
This is a place where
four and a half thousand years ago,

04:34.857 --> 04:38.194
Egypt's earliest pharaohs
invented the pyramids.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.379
The oldest is the Step Pyramid of Djoser.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.593
All the pharaohs
of the Third Dynasty that followed

05:03.177 --> 05:04.387
built their own.

05:05.596 --> 05:09.851
But there is one early pyramid
that's never been found.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.524
The missing Pyramid of Huni.

05:24.365 --> 05:29.037
This is the year
I will find that missing pyramid.

05:45.011 --> 05:49.932
All the big finds in the past
have always been made by foreigners.

05:53.269 --> 05:57.148
They came. They took the objects
and the glory for themselves.

06:07.116 --> 06:10.244
It's time that
Egypt takes back its history,

06:11.996 --> 06:14.999
and that the next big find
is made by Egyptians.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.800
As the head of the expedition,
I study the site very well.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.369
Four and a half thousand years ago,
at the end of the Third Dynasty,

06:51.452 --> 06:53.496
there was a pharaoh named Huni.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.039
He's lost to history.

07:01.796 --> 07:05.550
All we have is his name
on some of the kings lists.

07:06.551 --> 07:11.013
And there is a head of a statue
that some believe could be his.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.308
He looks like a strong king.

07:14.934 --> 07:20.314
Nearly all the kings of the Third Dynasty
before him built pyramids at Saqqara.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.276
Then this area is mysterious to us.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.653
We are hoping that this area could be

07:25.736 --> 07:28.781
the area that
the new pyramid could be discovered.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.868
Then we'll concentrate
the excavation here.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.579
We will start working in this area.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.205
I will direct Essam

07:36.289 --> 07:39.625
to make some test trenches
that will lead us to something.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.087
It will be good for us
if we make a square here in this area

07:43.171 --> 07:45.465
-to test this pile of the sand.
-Perfect. Okay.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.760
And we hope, if we discover his pyramid,

07:51.053 --> 07:53.347
we'll make him famous like Tutankhamun.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.433
He's the last king of Dynasty III,

07:55.516 --> 07:59.770
and therefore, the location
of his pyramid should be here.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.860
For three months out of the year,

08:07.069 --> 08:10.990
the desert is inhospitable to the living.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.785
Once the desert lets us in,

08:14.869 --> 08:19.832
we will have just nine months
before she pushes us back out.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.884
We have a big valley here.

08:29.967 --> 08:33.095
But this pile of debris is only here.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.640
Ah, right here.

08:36.224 --> 08:41.854
We will start the excavation here,
a 10x10 grid,

08:41.938 --> 08:43.314
here on this hill.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.859
Ahmed, you start to document
your points and levels,

08:47.401 --> 08:49.028
and bring the workers here.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.031
Let's do it.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.200
I am Essam Shehab.

08:56.369 --> 09:00.414
I started my career as an archeologist
under Dr. Zahi Hawass.

09:06.128 --> 09:09.757
Let's start the work.
Bring your tools, your wheelbarrows,

09:09.840 --> 09:11.300
the baskets and come up here.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.010
Come on, guys!

09:15.972 --> 09:19.100
Come on, Mehanny, put all the baskets
in the wheelbarrow and come up.

09:24.605 --> 09:28.067
When starting excavations,
there's an enthusiasm that drives you.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.489
Come on, guys.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.669
Egypt has a very long history.

09:49.213 --> 09:53.217
To understand what we are,
we have to understand what we were.

10:13.571 --> 10:17.158
I've been very successful
the last four seasons at Saqqara.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.329
The site that I'm leading
is where we found

10:21.412 --> 10:24.373
the Tomb of Wahtye four years ago.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.347
This season would be no different.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.766
Hopefully, we'll make another discovery

10:41.849 --> 10:44.268
that will drive the entire world crazy.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.983
The tombs here
are incredibly well-preserved.

10:52.401 --> 10:56.530
But there is one corner
that we have yet to excavate.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.790
I cannot describe
what it feels like to be an archeologist.

11:08.793 --> 11:13.964
When I do excavations,
I don't know what's beneath the ground.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.433
Beautiful.

11:25.976 --> 11:30.940
Imagine, the last person to hold
this amulet lived thousands of years ago.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.695
What was their world like?
What did they believe?

11:44.912 --> 11:50.334
The Bubasteion is one of the
richest archeological sites at Saqqara.

11:53.087 --> 11:56.841
Its history spans more than 2,500 years.

12:05.433 --> 12:10.271
For over a year, we've been saying
that the site is finished,

12:11.480 --> 12:14.150
but every day we discover something new.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.377
Hold on.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.713
What is this? Is this a stone?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.008
Okay, go on, but slowly.

12:41.093 --> 12:41.969
Carefully.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.513
It's a stone, yes.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.145
-Careful.
-There's a hole here.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.983
It's a shaft, boss.

12:56.066 --> 12:56.901
Shaft.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.324
It looks like a shaft lid.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.705
Yes, that's a shaft.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.499
A shaft lid.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.169
It's around 10 meters deep.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.731
Hamada, hang on to the rock.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.900
Careful! It could fall down!

14:00.840 --> 14:04.343
I'm entrusted with
sensitive and dangerous work.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.055
I must be able to handle that.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.685
I'd quit if I couldn't handle it.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.649
When I'm up at the top of the shaft,

14:18.732 --> 14:21.777
surrounded by my workers
and inspector colleagues,

14:21.861 --> 14:24.738
I'm in the world of the living.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.449
The natural world we all live in.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.621
When I descend…

14:33.789 --> 14:34.915
I'm being transported

14:36.542 --> 14:38.002
from the world of the living…

14:40.170 --> 14:41.505
to the world of the dead.

15:04.403 --> 15:08.115
The world of the dead is sacred,
full of hidden secrets.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.536
I'm always looking at the ceiling.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.833
The tomb's walls are full of cracks.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.796
Those cracks can cause the walls
to collapse at any moment.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.846
I always, always, always,

15:30.930 --> 15:34.391
with every move I make,
recite the name of God.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.190
"In the name of God" will protect me
when I stumble upon something harmful…

15:43.651 --> 15:48.197
a snake, a scorpion, or a harmful insect.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.129
God's mercy has protected me
until this very day.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.745
The Good Eye of Horus.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.706
My God.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.675
It's usually put with the mummies.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.971
To protect them in the other world.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.901
I always find myself
drawn to a certain point.

17:10.112 --> 17:14.742
I feel somehow drawn
to the people that are buried here.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.916
I've mentally connected to them.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.710
Where are you?

17:26.712 --> 17:29.256
Is that it? Or is there more to uncover?

17:46.607 --> 17:52.488
This is not a solid wall,
it leads to another area.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.407
A bigger area, or an extension.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.536
But the main area is on the other side.

18:01.580 --> 18:07.127
Hopefully, it leads us to a large
burial chamber, full of sarcophagi.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.964
Sarcophagi that hold
secrets, etchings, and writings

18:11.048 --> 18:13.926
that would paint a picture
of the Late Period.

18:15.010 --> 18:20.599
I really hope that the tunnel in the shaft
still goes further into the earth.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.229
There are secrets
hidden deep within this site.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.897
I'm the one to uncover them.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.118
Welcome, doctor.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.127
A test trench,
it's like a window through time.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.130
Thousands of years into the past.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.727
I'm telling you, this is a quarry.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.523
A quarry is a place that has limestone.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.984
Then the ancient Egyptian will go

19:54.067 --> 19:58.363
and take this limestone
to build the pyramids.

20:00.574 --> 20:05.412
You could see evidence that
the ancient Egyptian cut the stones,

20:05.495 --> 20:07.331
shaped the stones.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.708
And it gave me the idea

20:09.791 --> 20:14.838
that the location of the Pyramid of Huni
will be discovered in Gisr el-Mudir.

20:28.602 --> 20:33.190
We still have to do more work
to find the missing Pyramid of Huni.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.152
It has to be near the quarry.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.738
This is the area we need to work.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.748
This place is very promising.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.833
No one has worked here yet.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.213
So we have high hopes
of finding something important.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.592
This site, it's not easy.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.762
It contains many big mounds of sand.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.723
We need to take it out. It will take time.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.059
I'm looking for a strategy now.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.897
We need to increase
the number of the workmen.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.234
I give orders
that the workmen has to be 100.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.972
Issam, sing and encourage the workers!

21:51.601 --> 21:56.148
It's very important to be with the worker.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.233
To feel the ax.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.905
Because you don't expect
what the ax will hit.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.587
We hit shaft mouths.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.090
We found tombs.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.635
We'll leave this side as is.

22:31.808 --> 22:36.313
Finding one shaft means that you are
going to find a series of burial shafts.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.487
It's something big.

22:45.822 --> 22:50.077
Up to now,
we haven't even dug 10% of the area

22:51.370 --> 22:53.413
we are planning to excavate.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.882
A pyramid is always surrounded
by other tombs of the elite,

23:03.965 --> 23:06.301
from the pharaoh's inner circle.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.057
But Saqqara is a massive city of the dead.

23:12.724 --> 23:16.978
Not just for the elite,
but for all levels of Egyptian society.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.069
And we need more information
about this cemetery

23:24.152 --> 23:26.696
to determine if we are on the right path

23:27.489 --> 23:28.490
or not.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.693
The entrance!

24:05.652 --> 24:08.155
We got the entrance!

24:09.614 --> 24:13.493
This plaster from mud and silt.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.414
The ancient people made this.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.791
But what is behind this?

24:22.502 --> 24:25.464
At that moment, I would want
to yell at the top of my lungs

24:25.547 --> 24:27.757
that we've made a great discovery.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.970
But I'm not allowed to.

24:44.900 --> 24:49.321
We must call Dr. Waziry.

24:49.404 --> 24:50.572
Immediately!

24:52.532 --> 24:53.492
The boss.

24:54.451 --> 24:55.452
The boss.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.583
I had a phone call
from the director of the site.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.712
"We are in front
of something very important."

25:06.713 --> 25:07.923
"You've got to come."

25:13.595 --> 25:15.597
About 15 meters below ground…

25:17.891 --> 25:19.893
…we found a sealed entrance.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.149
In the name of God.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.744
An intact tomb…

25:39.496 --> 25:41.373
filled with coffins.

25:57.639 --> 26:01.351
In the middle
of darkness, I get a feeling…

26:05.021 --> 26:08.942
A feeling that takes me back
thousands of years ago.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.702
In the name of God, God is great.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.290
I do many excavations.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.504
Sometimes, I get this strong feeling…

26:36.595 --> 26:38.513
…an additional feeling…

26:48.690 --> 26:52.694
A feeling that
I will find something special.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.173
There is no oxygen here.

27:13.673 --> 27:17.010
We should not stay longer here.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.486
I'm in a hurry to go back,

27:35.111 --> 27:37.697
to go down in the shaft
to start searching.

27:39.366 --> 27:44.996
To find my explanation
for this feeling that I have.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.666
I don't mention this feeling to anyone.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.346
I know the big discovery
you're talking about.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.264
-What?
-This one, it was 33 years ago,

28:03.348 --> 28:04.974
when you discovered me…

28:05.058 --> 28:07.352
-How do you know?
-…the best Egyptologist in Egypt.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.190
I love this man.

28:13.483 --> 28:17.153
Dr. Hawass, for me,
is like my spiritual father.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.613
He's not my boss.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.449
But he is my boss.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.410
I am the head of Antiquities.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.578
I take both.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.497
I'm the boss.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.582
Alas, thank you.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.545
When I'm doing something,
I'm calling him. "Hey."

28:33.628 --> 28:34.963
Show me!

28:35.714 --> 28:37.090
Let me have a look.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.925
Gold! Look at the gold!

28:39.008 --> 28:44.013
When I came to Gisr El-Mudir, I told him
I'm searching for Huni's pyramid.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.516
Professor! Bubasteion…

28:46.599 --> 28:49.102
One day I would like to be like him?

28:50.270 --> 28:51.938
Almost. Almost.

28:52.021 --> 28:55.233
Shall I discover something
for you prehistoric?

28:56.484 --> 28:59.195
He is, for me,
he is everything in archaeology.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.158
For me, he is Zahi Hawass.

29:17.672 --> 29:21.468
When I was a young man,
I hated archaeology.

29:23.178 --> 29:29.726
When I go to any bookstore, all the books
written by foreign archeologists.

29:29.809 --> 29:34.731
When I open the TV,
I see foreign archeologists.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.026
All the interviews,

29:39.402 --> 29:41.196
never see an Egyptian.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.366
And that also killed me.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.829
Foreigners were ruling.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.458
But I said,
"We to need to compete with them."

29:53.541 --> 29:55.084
"We need to be good like them."

29:57.045 --> 30:00.298
I wanted, I was planning.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.969
"One day I'm going
to make a difference in Egyptology."

30:05.053 --> 30:08.890
"And one day,
my name will be written in history."

30:12.602 --> 30:13.686
And it happened.

30:15.897 --> 30:19.901
From the beginning of my career
as Assistant Inspector,

30:19.984 --> 30:23.822
going up in every stage.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.365
Inspector, Chief Inspector,

30:25.448 --> 30:27.283
Director, Director General,

30:27.367 --> 30:30.662
First Secretary of the State,
Head of Antiquities Minister…

30:30.745 --> 30:35.291
All my dreams, all my life, became true.

30:37.252 --> 30:42.340
Archaeology in the past
was like Raiders of the Lost Ark.

30:42.423 --> 30:47.053
Putting axes, taking sand,
put it away, we found a tomb!

30:48.471 --> 30:51.391
But now archaeology
is completely different.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.435
Archaeology is science.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.691
It's not digging to find the tomb, no!

31:00.525 --> 31:01.860
It's digging to find history,

31:02.861 --> 31:04.237
and to rewrite history.

31:09.242 --> 31:14.330
One of the biggest mysteries
is a time over 4,000 years ago.

31:15.373 --> 31:19.752
A time that's perhaps
as important to ancient Egypt

31:19.836 --> 31:23.089
as the Renaissance is to European history.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.135
The Old Kingdom.

31:28.177 --> 31:30.972
But that page of history has been lost.

31:31.931 --> 31:35.894
After the Old Kingdom,
people began to rob pyramids and tombs.

31:38.938 --> 31:41.232
Finding anything that survived

31:41.316 --> 31:45.528
over 4,000 years of decay
and looting is difficult.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.878
To this day, we've uncovered 10 tombs.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.636
Finding this number of tombs

32:10.553 --> 32:13.264
means that this is the beginning for us.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.520
We are expecting to find and reveal

32:19.604 --> 32:22.941
more and more of these tombs
here in this area.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.580
Oh God!

32:38.831 --> 32:39.958
Oh my God!

32:41.334 --> 32:42.168
What a beauty!

33:10.196 --> 33:12.573
Did you find it in the scene like this?

33:13.866 --> 33:17.745
God, this is beautiful!

33:20.123 --> 33:22.625
Tori! Look at the color!

33:23.209 --> 33:24.669
Leave your bag away.

33:25.294 --> 33:28.089
You cannot come
to the excavation with a bag.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.886
You look like
the Indiana Jones' girlfriend.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.559
You can't. Because I'm Indiana Jones.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.107
Wow, there's so many of them.

34:30.109 --> 34:34.030
The cachet of the statues
shows that the people were elite.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.325
They were not workmen or artisans,

34:38.451 --> 34:42.955
because for anyone to afford
to have beautiful statues like this,

34:43.039 --> 34:44.540
it's very expensive.

34:46.334 --> 34:49.170
I've never seen anything
in the Old Kingdom like this.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.349
Congratulations. This is really fantastic.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.517
Thank you, doctor.

35:03.810 --> 35:07.480
And actually,
I want to tell you something important.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.608
If you discover
a big, large cemetery like this,

35:10.691 --> 35:13.111
it should be next to one pyramid.

35:13.194 --> 35:16.823
No one will make a big cemetery like that

35:16.906 --> 35:21.786
without having someone important
to be buried, which could be a king.

35:24.080 --> 35:28.835
And this is why I really believe
we are at the beginning of the discovery,

35:28.918 --> 35:30.169
the beginning.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.966
Anyone who's buried
could be a target for thieves.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.607
We have very few examples

35:51.691 --> 35:55.153
of the unlooted monuments.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.077
But the cachet of statues

36:03.161 --> 36:06.330
indicated something important
to me at the beginning.

36:07.707 --> 36:13.087
It means that the thieves could not
find out the location of the statues.

36:16.591 --> 36:22.597
It proves that we are
in front of an intact cemetery.

36:23.472 --> 36:28.686
And you never see in any Old Kingdom site,
any intact cemetery.

36:34.483 --> 36:38.487
Imagine if Huni's pyramid
is also unlooted.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.367
That would be the discovery of a lifetime.

36:52.376 --> 36:56.380
It's very important for us
as an archeologist to have vision.

36:59.300 --> 37:04.096
It is not really to come and just
dig in a site and discover a tomb.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.139
That's nothing.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.530
It was his vision, that he knew,

37:21.614 --> 37:26.911
that the tomb of Tutankhamun
will be discovered completely intact.

37:26.994 --> 37:31.916
Howard Carter was keen
to discover the tomb.

37:31.999 --> 37:36.003
Anyone else, to work in the valley
for four years and never found anything,

37:36.087 --> 37:36.921
he would leave.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.508
Howard Carter was not lucky at all.

37:47.807 --> 37:51.560
But Howard Carter insisted
to continue his work

37:51.644 --> 37:53.688
because he knew he will discover the tomb.

38:08.828 --> 38:12.206
We are not in a hurry
to make a great discovery,

38:12.290 --> 38:17.128
but if you follow
the steps of archaeology,

38:18.045 --> 38:21.424
and you do your scientific excavation,

38:22.717 --> 38:27.471
you will reveal great things in history.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.434
The only thing I tell myself…

38:32.143 --> 38:35.271
"Zahi, be patient."

38:54.874 --> 38:58.794
This tomb dates
to about 600 years before Christ.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.922
Near the end of ancient Egyptian history.

39:08.054 --> 39:12.350
Every object and artifact in this shaft
has a single purpose.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.604
They are layers of magical protection

39:17.563 --> 39:20.900
designed to prevent the dead
from being disturbed.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.159
In order to open the coffins,

39:30.242 --> 39:33.245
we need to remove the statues
that surround them.

39:47.885 --> 39:51.097
It's a great honor to be the first person

39:51.180 --> 39:53.766
to touch these artifacts
after 2,400 years.

39:59.897 --> 40:04.318
I don't want to touch them,
but I will have to, to restore them.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.197
They call us "surgeons of civilizations."

40:19.750 --> 40:24.463
I have a patient
that needs intensive and quick care.

40:26.549 --> 40:30.886
There's a statue of a falcon.
Part of it was gilded.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.682
The gold is starting to peel off the face

40:34.765 --> 40:37.810
to the extent that
my breath is moving the gold.

40:38.477 --> 40:40.646
So this could fall at any moment.

40:55.494 --> 40:59.623
I take care of every move
and every breath.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.380
If I feel something move,
I stop immediately. Enough.

41:17.475 --> 41:21.103
We apply first aid to make sure
that the statue's face stays intact.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.007
True, it will take a long time.

41:57.264 --> 42:00.809
But to take a long time,
whether two, three, or ten days,

42:00.893 --> 42:02.770
or even a whole month,

42:02.853 --> 42:05.481
for something that's 2,400 years old,
that's nothing.

42:10.069 --> 42:14.114
Any artifact that is
partially damaged or destroyed…

42:15.950 --> 42:19.537
means lost knowledge
of the ancient Egyptian history.

42:22.665 --> 42:27.044
Ancient Egyptians
surrounded themselves with magic

42:28.212 --> 42:30.089
for protection in the afterlife.

42:45.271 --> 42:47.648
According to the ancient Egyptian belief,

42:47.731 --> 42:49.400
when we pass away,

42:49.483 --> 42:52.152
we will need small cups…

42:55.030 --> 42:58.325
because the soul is small.

43:02.204 --> 43:06.417
So they put miniature cups,

43:06.500 --> 43:09.628
glasses and trays in the tomb,

43:11.797 --> 43:18.012
so it can protect and feed the soul
in the afterlife.

43:25.811 --> 43:29.607
But there's other items placed there
that don't have an explanation.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.318
-It's a finger.
-Hamada, it's a finger.

43:32.401 --> 43:36.196
This is very unexpected!

43:38.574 --> 43:40.701
A finger! How come?!

43:50.669 --> 43:52.212
What does it mean?

43:53.589 --> 43:56.717
These strange and puzzling artifacts.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.429
There's very little
information about them.

44:02.014 --> 44:05.726
Without writings,
we won't be able to understand anything.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.813
The last person to leave the chamber,

44:09.897 --> 44:12.024
the priest,

44:13.150 --> 44:16.278
performs magical spells and rituals

44:16.987 --> 44:21.659
that will keep the chamber hidden forever.

44:23.827 --> 44:28.999
In the eyes of the ancient Egyptian,
we're here to ruin his rituals.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.680
The most important thing
to the ancient Egyptian

45:25.556 --> 45:30.602
is that his body
has to stay in good shape,

45:31.645 --> 45:34.106
because the soul will inhabit it…

45:37.443 --> 45:42.489
then leave it to meet the god Osiris
in the day journey.

45:47.161 --> 45:51.206
It's a long journey
that takes a whole day.

45:55.502 --> 45:58.464
He'll swim with the god Osiris
around the sun disc…

46:01.967 --> 46:03.719
and then come back in the evening.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.393
The soul returns again to its tomb.

46:14.271 --> 46:17.191
The ancient Egyptians, they did everything

46:17.733 --> 46:21.278
to protect their bodies
for having life after death.

46:22.738 --> 46:26.909
They did their best to hide their tombs.

46:28.160 --> 46:33.457
Because they believe if their bodies
were destroyed for any reason…

46:35.375 --> 46:38.504
then they will be deprived
from the life after death.

46:56.271 --> 47:00.025
Within four months,
we succeeded to uncover

47:00.108 --> 47:04.488
about 153 shafts.

47:07.866 --> 47:13.372
And when we talk about shafts,
we are talking about burial chambers.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.874
Before we go down,

47:15.958 --> 47:21.296
we are removing the debris
blocking the mouth of the burial shaft.

47:26.385 --> 47:29.930
The deposit that filled the shaft
can help me to know

47:30.013 --> 47:33.725
if this tomb was robbed or not.

47:38.146 --> 47:39.982
If I find only sand,

47:41.233 --> 47:44.611
it means that this tomb was looted,

47:44.695 --> 47:47.072
because sand came with the wind.

47:47.155 --> 47:51.118
It means that this tomb
was opened for very long time.

47:53.287 --> 47:59.543
But if the shaft of the tomb
is filled with crushed limestone

47:59.626 --> 48:02.754
or fragments of mud brick…

48:05.549 --> 48:09.136
it means that
this shaft was not opened before,

48:09.219 --> 48:11.847
so we found it intact.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.228
Move it to the top!

48:39.458 --> 48:41.335
Lord, be with me.

48:45.797 --> 48:47.424
Moving down.

48:47.507 --> 48:48.508
Going down.

48:54.973 --> 48:57.517
Come on, darling, get down. Good job.

49:00.729 --> 49:01.563
Stop.

49:05.233 --> 49:06.610
Pray, guys. Good job.

49:13.659 --> 49:15.160
This is a face.

49:17.204 --> 49:19.206
We have located the wall.

49:19.289 --> 49:22.876
We'll keep going down
until we get to the ground. Okay, doctor.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.504
-Good job.
-Thanks, doctor.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.651
What do you see down there?

49:49.027 --> 49:51.154
I see through this opening a sarcophagus.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.699
Congratulations, guys! Good job.

49:55.867 --> 49:58.787
When we uncover
the remains from the Old Kingdom,

49:58.870 --> 50:03.166
we're ecstatic as archeologists
because those are from so far in the past.

50:11.133 --> 50:16.638
At the end of Egyptian civilization,
mummification was popular.

50:17.931 --> 50:21.059
And many people were being mummified.

50:21.977 --> 50:27.983
But in the Old Kingdom, they were only
beginning to figure out mummification.

50:31.278 --> 50:35.157
What we find in the tomb
may tell us the status of people

50:35.240 --> 50:37.534
buried in this area of the cemetery.

50:41.371 --> 50:42.914
Hey, doctor.

50:43.999 --> 50:46.293
Reis, why do you think
it's not been opened before?

50:46.376 --> 50:49.880
Because it was completely sealed
from the entrance.

50:51.590 --> 50:54.134
The sarcophagus is very simple.

50:54.217 --> 50:56.428
But still, it's sealed.

50:56.511 --> 51:00.640
It's sealed since
more than 4,000 years ago.

51:00.724 --> 51:06.271
And we are going to open it now,
and we'll see what could be hidden inside.

51:09.775 --> 51:13.612
Move the lever from the front to the back.

51:13.695 --> 51:15.697
Support your back.

51:15.781 --> 51:17.240
In the name of God.

51:19.117 --> 51:21.244
Push from here.

51:45.310 --> 51:48.438
It's a skeleton.

51:50.190 --> 51:53.985
Mummified, but not really
excellent mummification,

51:54.861 --> 51:58.824
because the part of the chest
is deteriorated.

52:14.422 --> 52:17.425
We are not going to take this mummy out.

52:18.218 --> 52:20.303
I will leave it as it is.

52:23.765 --> 52:26.726
I'd like to leave him in peace.

52:29.187 --> 52:33.358
This man was important,
because he was mummified.

52:35.402 --> 52:39.364
But after 4,000 years of decomposition,

52:39.447 --> 52:41.616
this burial is too deteriorated

52:41.700 --> 52:47.164
to give us any more clues
to this person's status in society.

52:50.208 --> 52:54.004
You get surprised
by results you didn't expect.

52:56.047 --> 52:59.885
This is what archaeology is,
it's the beauty of it.

53:02.804 --> 53:05.182
I am not looking for just one burial.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.393
I am looking to the whole cemetery.

53:08.476 --> 53:12.439
Is this poor
or this more rich, or more elite?

53:14.316 --> 53:16.693
That will be the key to knowing for sure

53:16.776 --> 53:20.572
if this cemetery is connected
to a royal tomb or not.

53:21.448 --> 53:26.369
We have to keep excavating
to find more conclusive evidence

53:26.453 --> 53:28.997
that there is a pyramid in this area.

53:43.511 --> 53:46.056
One millimeter at a time, please!

53:48.600 --> 53:49.601
Slowly!

54:02.280 --> 54:03.740
Okay, that's it!

54:03.823 --> 54:04.824
Thank God.

54:08.995 --> 54:12.332
The conservators have
finally finished their work.

54:14.167 --> 54:16.795
The statues are now strong enough

54:16.878 --> 54:20.423
that we can risk
transporting them out of the tomb.

54:28.014 --> 54:32.936
But now we're gonna start
to unlock the coffin.

54:34.938 --> 54:39.192
Keep the masks on, we are opening coffins.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.444
God knows what condition
the mummies are in.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.613
Come on! You guys ready?

54:48.618 --> 54:52.914
This one, it's well-sealed,
as you can see the remains of this mortar.

55:09.139 --> 55:12.475
Lift it up a little.
A little from your side.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.269
Hamada, bring the one you're holding.

55:39.794 --> 55:43.965
-There's a weird smell.
-You're right, Hamada. Youssef, stop.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.885
Youssef, stop.

55:49.095 --> 55:52.098
It's very smelly.
So we have to be very careful.

55:52.182 --> 55:55.185
Maybe it's germs, maybe it's bacteria,
it's whatever… I don't know.

55:55.268 --> 55:59.064
When we were opening the coffin,

55:59.147 --> 56:03.485
I smelled something really strange.
The smell is that of a decomposed body.

56:03.568 --> 56:05.737
The smell of a human being,
like you and I,

56:05.820 --> 56:08.573
who was put in a coffin 2,600 years ago.

56:11.701 --> 56:13.703
Come on, in the name of God. Let's do it.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.174
This mummy,

56:27.550 --> 56:28.760
it was well-sealed.

56:31.679 --> 56:34.933
But something wrong happened,
maybe a long time ago.

56:38.353 --> 56:41.940
But this mummy, it was not
really mummified in a perfect way.

56:42.023 --> 56:44.651
So that's why it was deteriorated easily.

56:44.734 --> 56:48.738
Maybe it's a mistake
of the ancient Egyptian embalmers.

56:51.282 --> 56:54.452
No. The mummy is in really
very bad condition of preservation.

56:55.328 --> 56:57.831
The mummy was completely oxidized.

57:01.501 --> 57:05.004
The writings were all broken.

57:05.880 --> 57:11.094
You can't understand one sentence of it.
Not even the name of the deceased.

57:11.678 --> 57:14.639
So this is truly sad for any archeologist.

57:14.722 --> 57:18.017
When you don't have any writings,
you can't do anything but sit clueless.

57:23.565 --> 57:26.568
After opening the three stone coffins

57:27.360 --> 57:31.406
and not being able to find
useful information about them…

57:34.534 --> 57:38.538
all hopes depend on the wooden coffins

57:38.621 --> 57:44.335
and finding any text,
object, or information inside them

57:44.419 --> 57:48.339
that could tell us
something about the tomb.

57:59.726 --> 58:03.771
On the lid, there are inscriptions.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.026
Osir, Ahmose…

58:08.109 --> 58:09.068
His name.

58:11.946 --> 58:14.240
This means it belongs to…

58:14.324 --> 58:16.910
-So his name is Ahmose?
-Yes.

58:16.993 --> 58:19.037
So the name
of the coffin's owner is Ahmose.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.500
His mother is Nebut.

58:23.583 --> 58:27.587
His mother.
No, because this means "born from."

58:27.670 --> 58:31.132
So, what is our final conclusion?

58:31.216 --> 58:33.635
-The name is Ahmose.
-His name is Ahmose.

58:33.718 --> 58:36.804
He is the son of Sekhet.

58:43.353 --> 58:46.397
In the name of God. Three, two, one, go!

58:46.481 --> 58:49.651
Stay up there. Keep it high!

58:51.945 --> 58:53.196
Move a little in there.

58:53.279 --> 58:55.615
-Right here, professor.
-Down here.

58:57.325 --> 59:00.203
By his feet, a bronze protector statue.

59:00.912 --> 59:03.456
This is a bronze cat. A bronze cat.

59:06.876 --> 59:09.546
On his chest, a tiny gold amulet.

59:11.339 --> 59:13.049
Look at that!

59:13.132 --> 59:14.634
A bird with a human head.

59:16.261 --> 59:17.637
The ba, his soul.

59:18.346 --> 59:22.225
Guys, I'm looking at something
that I'm not sure what it is.

59:22.308 --> 59:24.435
Let me through.

59:26.020 --> 59:29.023
-What is that?
-It's something round!

59:29.107 --> 59:30.525
-I've never…
-Cylindrical shape.

59:30.608 --> 59:32.694
It's wrapped up in linen.

59:32.777 --> 59:34.904
I've never seen something like it.

59:34.988 --> 59:37.782
Professor Ashraf will tell us
if it's safe to touch it.

59:38.491 --> 59:42.620
When Dr. Waziry asked me
to touch the object,

59:42.704 --> 59:46.749
I was very afraid
because it may be very dry.

59:46.833 --> 59:50.670
And if it's very dry, it is like a powder.

59:51.170 --> 59:53.548
Let's do this. God be with us.

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.183
What do you think is in there?

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:08.688
-I think it's something…
-It's some kind of paper.

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:12.859
It's a papyrus!

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:16.029
It's a papyrus inside a pocket.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.739
Oh God!

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:19.032
This is amazing!

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.451
This is amazing! This is a first.

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:25.622
-This is a first.
-I've never seen such a thing!

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.750
A good thing that it's wrapped,

01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:31.502
because this has protected it
from being damp.

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:36.341
It will definitely contain secrets
of the civilization of ancient Egypt.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.509
There is Harris Papyrus and Ebers Papyrus

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:43.890
and other papyrus that was named
by its discoverer, and their team.

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:46.684
I see no problem in naming it…

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:47.894
-Waziry!
-Waziry!

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.690
-Waziry Papyrus!
-Of course, congratulations!

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.484
-All agree?
-We do, professor!

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:57.153
-Waziry Papyrus?
-Congratulations!

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.659
I've been working in this field
for more than 30 years.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.745
Yeah, we used to find
little pieces of papyrus.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:10.708
But to find untouched
scroll of papyrus like this?

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:13.127
This is something really very important.

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:22.512
A complete papyrus
is more valuable than gold.

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:26.516
Because it contains lost knowledge.

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:32.021
This might be the second or third ancient
Egyptian papyrus found in such shape.

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:43.700
Congratulations, doctor.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.215
What's the direction of Mecca?
I swear, I'm thanking God.

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:09.976
The ancient Egyptians did not plan

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:15.690
to just keep their belongings,
to be hidden down there forever.

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:21.237
They believed that there's resurrection,
immortality and an afterlife.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:28.286
Now, we will bring them
back to life after 2,500 years.

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:30.663
Today they will see the light
for the first time.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:36.252
All this heritage is hidden underground,

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:37.712
it's invisible to everyone.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.799
I believe it should be taken up…

01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:48.973
…to be displayed in museums
for all humanity to see it.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:24.717
A lot of questions,
they were running in my mind.

01:03:25.426 --> 01:03:26.928
What kind of papyri is this one?

01:03:27.678 --> 01:03:29.263
How big is it going to be?

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:34.310
You think is going to be fragments like
the rest of the papyri that people found?

01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:37.939
Maybe, just maybe, it's a complete one?

01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:38.940
I don't know.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.818
Could it have missing parts? I don't know.

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:44.904
I want to learn more.

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:50.201
But of course we have to protect it,
so it's inside the fumigation bag.

01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:53.246
For how long? At least three weeks.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:58.084
And I can't wait
for those days to pass fast

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.710
until the sterilization.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:01.754
Then humidification processes are done.

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.048
Then we open the papyrus.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:20.231
After almost nine months,
we are still working.

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.026
And with every passing day,

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:29.115
the conditions out in the desert
become more difficult for the team.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.618
-We keep going?
-We'll continue to work normally.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.996
But if it starts getting too windy?

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:38.374
If it gets too dusty and we can't see,
we can't keep going.

01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:45.006
We can tolerate the heat and the sun,

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:49.218
but the storm is very hard.

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:54.307
When the storm hits you,

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.311
you cannot even close your mouth.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.442
We suffer a lot.

01:05:04.525 --> 01:05:10.281
But at the end, the discovery
makes you forget any difficulties.

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:19.790
We found a shaft
with an unlooted burial chamber.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.007
Do you have a light?

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:32.219
It's huge.

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:38.100
There is a huge limestone sarcophagus,
perfectly sealed.

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:42.438
Imahu, "the honored one."

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:44.649
"Under"…

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:46.651
Nebet Hut.

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:52.114
The word "overseer," Imerah,
is only for high people.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.367
This is the highest title.

01:05:56.577 --> 01:05:59.789
Her name is Nebet Hut.
Inside here should be a lady.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:23.980
Okay, silence! Silent!

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:29.235
I need more space.

01:06:55.469 --> 01:07:01.976
You are looking at a woman
dated back 4,300 years ago.

01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:06.605
Over 1,000 years older than King Tut.

01:07:15.948 --> 01:07:16.949
Beautiful.

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.875
Beautifully mummified.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.377
Oh God!

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:32.590
The color of the necklace,

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.426
green and blue.

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:42.224
Two pieces of a beautiful headrest.

01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:47.730
Gold.

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:49.815
Gold.

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:12.004
I think this is maybe the best mummy
we found until now in this cemetery.

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:25.392
It's very rare that
you can make a discovery like this.

01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:34.652
Most of the beautiful mummies
are dated 3,000 years ago.

01:08:34.735 --> 01:08:40.032
But this mummy is maybe the oldest
beautiful mummy ever found in Egypt.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:49.416
In the Old Kingdom,
mummification was extremely rare.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:55.631
Only a pharaoh or someone in his court
would have access to that technology.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:03.472
Now, the most exciting thing,
this is the work we're going to continue.

01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:05.099
Examining the mummy.

01:09:07.726 --> 01:09:10.646
Of course, it's something amazing.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:13.524
It's a great feeling.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:22.491
I took samples,
being as careful as possible

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:25.870
to not destroy the mummy that's under me.

01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:33.961
For example, I took samples of the linen

01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:38.174
and also from a black substance
on the head,

01:09:38.257 --> 01:09:39.508
and around the skull.

01:09:39.592 --> 01:09:43.262
I need to know what they're made of.

01:09:45.472 --> 01:09:50.853
We have the use of resin
for the mummification of the face.

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:56.775
In the Old Kingdom,
the resin was used very rarely,

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.781
which means she could be
part of the royal palace.

01:10:06.785 --> 01:10:10.956
The mummy we're seeing in front of us
is not your everyday mummy in Saqqara.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.085
We usually see a shaft,
a shaft with bones.

01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:20.549
But to see a mummy that's almost whole,
from the Old Kingdom,

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:24.220
this is obviously something extraordinary
from this period of time.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:31.727
I've been working in Saqqara a long time.
I saw different mummies.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.939
But this is the first time for me
to see a gilded cane next to one.

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:39.068
This would mean that this person
is very important and should be respected.

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:44.448
No ordinary person will carry a cane
with them that's coated with gold.

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:48.911
So this is clearly
a unique mummy from this period.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.916
Every time we stand in front of a mummy,

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.545
the first thing that comes to mind,
"Who was that person?"

01:11:00.297 --> 01:11:02.549
Was that an eminent person in society?

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:05.427
Would I have been able
to stand in front of him,

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.596
during his existence? In his period?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:15.646
No one of the elite
will be buried in an isolated cemetery.

01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:18.482
She cannot go alone to the afterlife.

01:11:18.565 --> 01:11:23.195
She has to fly together
with a big soul, with a king.

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:28.450
And therefore,
I believe that we are going to discover

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:33.372
a big, large,
important pyramid for a king.

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:35.708
The Pyramid of Huni.

01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:40.713
Maybe I will fail.

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:44.008
But maybe I will find it.

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:50.472
We're still working.

01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:07.406
-Is this completely closed?
-Yes.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.450
We uncovered 83 meters from it.

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:14.330
You will also see a step on top.

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:16.457
You will see it.

01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:22.463
It supports the idea
of this being a pyramid.

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:25.049
What else could it be?

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:36.310
Eighty meters,
and this is the corner here.

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:48.989
I'm looking for the Pyramid of Huni.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:56.413
Now, if I discover this pyramid,
maybe intact, then my dream became true.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:05.172
And this is why this Huni,
who is very little known in history,

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:10.052
he will come back to be famous
in the history of Egypt.

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.723
The angle here is clear.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:20.646
Great.

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:24.108
We will proceed with the work,
so all workers need to be here.

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.652
A team on this side here.

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:30.406
Clean and uncover this whole area here.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.701
We'll work completely in this area now.

01:13:35.327 --> 01:13:39.665
No more tombs, but we will go
to discover the new pyramid.

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:45.754
Look at the size of this wall.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:49.675
It's 83 meters long from here to there.

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:52.261
It's 100% the base of the pyramid,

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:54.471
or could be
the enclosure wall of the pyramid.

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:57.224
Actually, we are going
to start the excavation

01:13:57.307 --> 01:14:00.686
from this corner for about 20 meters,

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:03.730
until we can find
the length of the side also.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:11.447
We are looking at the beginning
of a discovery of a new pyramid

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.407
for the first time at Saqqara.

01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:34.803
Until today,
we can't confirm that it is a pyramid,

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:39.933
so we are waiting to see
the other side of the wall,

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.561
to see if it could be a pyramid or not.

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:47.274
What are you planning to do
in the site of Bubasteion?

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:53.780
It is a good timing
for the end of the season.

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:57.743
-Very good discovery to announce!
-What's the discovery?

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:01.622
No, I'm not going to tell you.
I'll keep it secret.

01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:04.249
It's like…

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:07.169
Like the old days.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:13.926
Ah, Dr. Zahi, remember the good old days.

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:19.890
Over the last four decades,

01:15:19.973 --> 01:15:23.310
I have trained
an army of Egyptian archeologists.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:28.440
They will go on even after I am long gone.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.444
More than anything I have discovered,

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.697
that will be my legacy.

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:43.789
I taught all my assistants
how to be a good archeologist.

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:49.211
But I'll never be able
to teach them the passion.

01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:54.591
But I hope that one of them can find it.

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:43.599
This is the end.

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:47.561
Wow.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:49.563
Finally!

01:16:55.611 --> 01:17:00.115
The layer of the papyrus is very thin.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:07.205
A third of a millimeter!
So dangerous to handle.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:27.893
"These are the words of the god Osiris."

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:29.936
The god of death!

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:54.628
This papyrus is
something like nine meters.

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:59.966
This papyri contains chapters
of The Book of Death.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:05.514
It was found by Egyptian missions,
Egyptian hands,

01:18:05.597 --> 01:18:08.016
so we're going to call it
with Egyptian name.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.686
Waziry Papyri.

01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:15.857
And we did register the papyri
with this name, Waziry Papyri.

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:21.571
Long live Egypt, and congratulations.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:25.784
This is my mission,

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:30.956
to show the entire world that Egyptians
are the future of archaeology in Egypt.

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:33.875
This papyrus is only the beginning.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:39.631
The beauty of archaeology is that
the search to understand our past,

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.258
to uncover new knowledge,

01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:43.635
is never over.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:54.980
If you discover a pyramid of a king,
it's something amazing.

01:18:56.857 --> 01:19:01.528
I really believe that
when we excavate the site completely,

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:04.573
this will be the news all over the world.

01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:11.246
Because hundreds of archeologists
searched for the Pyramid of Huni.

01:19:12.497 --> 01:19:15.542
We need at least one year of excavation.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:20.130
Archaeology is a process,

01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:22.382
a journey into the unknown.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:29.347
It took Howard Carter five years
to find the tomb of King Tut,

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:34.603
but he kept going
because he believed in his dream.

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:40.650
But if you don't have a dream,
you will never get to your destination.

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:48.033
Every morning when I wake up,
I begin to dream and wonder.

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:52.662
What will we find at the excavation today?

01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:55.832
What's inside the pyramid?

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.544
Does it really belong to Huni?

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:04.007
Or to some other lost pharaoh
we have never heard of?

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:10.138
All my dreams are in it

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:13.225
because I know what's going to happen.

01:20:14.267 --> 01:20:16.311
Everything I predicted,

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.522
it became true.
