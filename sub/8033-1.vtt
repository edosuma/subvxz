( birds chirping )

00:46.088 --> 00:49.549

00:59.768 --> 01:04.772
- ( bell tolling )

01:17.745 --> 01:19.203
Good morning, Elisa.

Reverend, thank you

01:23.375 --> 01:25.501
- Morning.
- lt was a great sermon.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.879
Child narrating:
lt was about three years ago.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.214
l was the only kid
in church that day.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.675
The others were with lsaac
out in the cornfield.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.303
I didn't get to go
'cause Dad didn't like lsaac.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.014
He was pretty smart,
my dad.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.269
After church, we went to Hansen's--
just Iike aIways.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.354
Sarah was home sick
with Mom.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.690
She'd come down
with the fever real sudden.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.611
- ( child grunts )
- Man: Morning, Dave.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.155
- Morning, Pop. How are you?
- How are the wife and Sarah?

01:54.239 --> 01:56.866
Dad was worried, so he went
to caII Mom first thing.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.744
Sarah's been better.
l'm going to call your mom, okay?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.287
Okay.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.498
Mr. Hansen:
l bet dad wants a cup of coffee.

02:05.751 --> 02:09.252
- Okay, Joby, you want your usual?
- Yeah, strawberry shake.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.881
That's when I saw
Malachai and the others.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.550
l guess their meeting
with Isaac was over.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.057
- Dave: Hi.
- They were acting real creepy.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.850
Mr. Hansen:
Francis.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.187
- Here you go, Joby.
- Oh, thanks.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.985

02:38.075 --> 02:39.909
How is she?

02:39.993 --> 02:42.286
- ( Sarah moaning )
- l'm worried, Dave.

02:42.371 --> 02:46.582
Her fever's gone
from 101 to 104.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.626
- Uh-huh.
- ( bell rings )

02:50.754 --> 02:52.129
Dave: Sure.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.888
Mm-hmm.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.616
How are you?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.202
- May l have some cream?
- Okay.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.372
( crow squawks )

03:28.417 --> 03:30.042
Woman:
Good coffee.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.259
( groans )

03:41.138 --> 03:43.848
( strained gasping )

03:46.184 --> 03:48.561
( gasping, gagging )

03:51.982 --> 03:53.649
Woman:
What's going on?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.818
Woman #2: This young man's
got a weapon. ( screams )

03:55.903 --> 03:57.028
Oh my God!

03:59.698 --> 04:02.158
No!

04:02.242 --> 04:03.492
Joby:
Stop it!

04:07.915 --> 04:09.749
Dave, are you
listening to me?

04:12.044 --> 04:13.544
Don't do it!

04:13.629 --> 04:17.089
( screaming )
Don't do it! No!

04:21.887 --> 04:24.472
Joby: Don't! No!

04:37.694 --> 04:39.987
( door bell jingles )

04:40.072 --> 04:43.658
Woman: What are you kids--
( muffIed screaming )

04:49.206 --> 04:52.041
( Joby narrating )
lt happened everywhere in Gatlin that day.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.544
That's when Sarah
started drawing these pictures.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.510
( horn blows )

07:07.594 --> 07:09.553

To live happily

07:42.671 --> 07:45.756
- Mm.
- ls that a proposal?

07:45.841 --> 07:49.135
No... it's not.

Okay.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.888

08:02.691 --> 08:04.608

08:08.321 --> 08:11.657
Oh, that's nice.

We'd better get going.
We've got a lot of driving to do today.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.032
Couldn't we just say,
"the hell with it"?

09:35.116 --> 09:37.910
- Stay here for a couple of hours?
- Mm, l wish.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.915
Starting Monday,

09:42.999 --> 09:46.001
I've got a coupIe

09:56.263 --> 09:58.847
Um, we'll be out
in a minute.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.767
Oh, we got to
get going.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.562
l wanna grab a quick shower
before we go, okay?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.873
You're making something
out of nothing.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.543
Right. To me it's something;
to you it's nothing.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.963
l'm just worried about
this internship, okay?

10:31.047 --> 10:33.549
I've been working
for this for four years.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.135
- I know.
- ( sighs )

10:37.470 --> 10:38.846
l do understand.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.852
- Why do you have to be such a jerk about it?
- ( chuckles )

10:51.609 --> 10:53.527
"Welcome to Nebraska."

11:01.119 --> 11:03.662
( rooster crows )

11:23.099 --> 11:25.517
Joby's voice: We weren't the only ones
who thought lsaac was weird.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.354
One day Joseph told us
he was running away.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.773
He said he couldn't
take it anymore.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.859
He was pretty scared.
l wasn't.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.695
- l'm scared!
- Me too!

11:36.780 --> 11:38.280
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.783
l said l'd come back for you.
l promise.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.619
- Can't we go with you, please?
- No!

11:43.703 --> 11:45.954
l'd never make it
with you two.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.124
- But we don't like it here.
- l said you'll be all right!

11:49.209 --> 11:51.460
As long as nobody finds
them pictures you've been drawin'.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.878
She can't help it.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.672
That won't matter
to lsaac and Malachai.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.633
They'll take it as a sign.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.135
Anyways, you know crayons
and drawings are forbidden...

12:00.220 --> 12:02.096
just Iike having
that record player.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.890
But we like it.
lsaac doesn't let us do anything!

12:04.974 --> 12:07.851
Well, you just better
mind him till l get back

12:07.936 --> 12:10.979
or else you know
what happens.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.152
You're not going
through the corn, are ya?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.655
- l can't go no other way.
- But what about--

12:19.739 --> 12:21.281
l said it'll be all right!

12:21.366 --> 12:23.575
UnIess you teII
anybody l'm gone.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.829
- We won't.
- Cross your heart? Hope to die?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.580
All: Stick a needle
in your eye.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.708
Okay, you know what
that means now?

12:31.793 --> 12:35.337
lf you tell, you're gonna
burn in the lake of fire for all eternity!

12:35.422 --> 12:37.798
Make sure nobody's lookin'.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.139
Okay! Go!

12:45.223 --> 12:48.475
Sarah: Nobody's looking!
Nobody's Iooking!

13:18.006 --> 13:20.382
( Vicky yawns )

13:34.439 --> 13:36.815
Burt:
l spy with my little eye

13:36.900 --> 13:38.901
something that begins
with the letter C.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.487
- Corn.
- Right.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.364
So now we know...

13:44.449 --> 13:47.367
the backroads are even less interesting
than the highway.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.788
Maybe they've
discovered music.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.500
- Preacher: Halleluiah!
- Crowd: HaIIeIuiah!

13:54.584 --> 13:57.503
Preacher: There are many mansions
in His house.

13:57.587 --> 14:01.131
But there's no room
for the fornicator!

14:01.216 --> 14:03.091
- Oh no room!
- Crowd: No room...

14:03.176 --> 14:06.887
- for the homosexual!
- Both: No room!

14:08.306 --> 14:12.601
- No room for the drug abusers!
- Both: Oh no, no room!

14:13.811 --> 14:15.979
Amen! Peanut butter
and white bread!

14:16.064 --> 14:17.940
There's no room
for the college graduate!

14:18.024 --> 14:21.276
No room for peopIe
who watch public television!

14:21.361 --> 14:24.446
- No room for commitment!
- Amen!

14:24.531 --> 14:25.864
( chuckles )

14:27.617 --> 14:28.951
Come on.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.418
( panting )

14:48.346 --> 14:51.139
( crow squawks )

14:53.935 --> 14:56.019
( faint giggling )

15:03.027 --> 15:04.403
( gasps )

15:27.427 --> 15:30.470
Ah!
( grunting, gagging )

15:34.976 --> 15:36.643
Vicky: Here it is.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.397
l wonder how it
got in here.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.400
Not me.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.408
Okay now,
it looks like...

15:51.492 --> 15:53.785
this one goes goes
to Grand IsIand,

15:53.870 --> 15:55.704
and this one cuts
up to the highway.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.127
Where's this GatIin
we've been seeing signs for?

16:03.504 --> 16:04.963
lt's not on here.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.424
What do you mean?
lt's gotta be on here somewhere.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.675
Burt, look out!

16:08.760 --> 16:12.638
- ( tires screech )
- ( screams )

16:17.560 --> 16:19.353
( groans )

16:20.980 --> 16:22.022
Hang on.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.275
Let me check.
Let me check.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.487
- Where, right there?
- Yeah.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.865
- ( gasps )
- lt's just a bump.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.575
Just try and relax.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.664
That was an animal, right?

16:39.957 --> 16:41.875
l got to go
back there, okay?

16:41.959 --> 16:43.543
Just stay here
and try and rest.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.267
Come on, buddy.

17:01.479 --> 17:02.896
Oh lord.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.775
( crow squawks )

17:06.858 --> 17:09.111
ls... he...

17:10.154 --> 17:11.946
Oh, yeah.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.369
( gasping )

17:19.789 --> 17:22.040
- Oh my God!
- Easy, easy, easy. Come on.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.251
Easy.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.837
Take it easy.
Don't look at him.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.469
Okay, now,
listen to me.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.805
There's something
very wrong here.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.433
So l want you to go back to the car
and wait for me there,

17:39.517 --> 17:41.643
Understand? Keep all the doors
Iocked untiI I get back.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.396
- Why? Where are you going?
- l'll tell you when l get back.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.773
- Just do what l say.
- Okay.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.600
( heavy breathing )

19:16.489 --> 19:17.781
( indistinct chuckling )

19:35.258 --> 19:36.675
( soft grinding )

19:56.863 --> 20:17.966
Burt?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.312
Burt?!

20:50.374 --> 20:53.084
l'm so sorry.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.544
( screams )

20:54.629 --> 20:57.756
- Vicky, come on.
- ( panting ) Burt!

20:57.840 --> 20:59.716
- Easy, calm down.
- I kneeIed--

20:59.800 --> 21:02.135
l kneeled down next to him.
He said...

21:03.638 --> 21:05.180
lt's okay.
Take it easy.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.265
Just take it easy.
ReIax.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.185
You're okay.
You understand?

21:10.269 --> 21:13.521
- Yeah.
- You're okay.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.399
lt's okay.
Everything's okay.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.987
You're okay.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.070
( music playing )

22:02.154 --> 22:04.406
Joby: Me and Sarah were playing
in our oId house.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.157
We played there lots.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.368
MaIachai said
it was forbidden.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.287
But I think that was 'cause
nobody ever asked him to play.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.124
When l grow up,

22:14.208 --> 22:17.836
l'm gonna have all
the money in the world.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.254
Me too.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.756
- You can't.
- Why not?

22:21.841 --> 22:25.260
- Because l'm gonna have it.
- l'll get it first.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.720
- Will not.
- Will too!

22:26.804 --> 22:28.179
- Will not!
- Will too!

22:28.264 --> 22:29.597
Oh yeah, how?

22:38.482 --> 22:39.858
lt's easy.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.777
Seven.

22:42.862 --> 22:47.073
One, two, three,
four, five,

22:49.201 --> 22:50.952
seven.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.454
All right, see?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.707
$200.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.834
Uh-uh, Joby.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.717
How much?

23:05.801 --> 23:09.137
13 thousand
hundred dollars.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.639
13 thousand
hundred dollars?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.726
Uh, okay,
$2,000.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.312
Mm-hmm.
l thought so.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.357
100, 200--

23:21.442 --> 23:23.234
l got a great idea.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.863
Let's pretend
this guy is lsaac.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.782
And we're gonna
put him in jail.

23:28.866 --> 23:32.160
What if he gets
a get-out-of-jail-free card?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.162
Simple as that.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.372
- What cards?
- ( both laughing )

23:55.601 --> 23:58.311
Do you think it might have been
some kind of accident,

23:58.395 --> 24:00.063
like farm equipment
or something?

24:00.147 --> 24:01.564
Not a wound
Iike that.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.401
His throat was cut
deliberately.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.865
He was aIready dead
when he stumbled out into the road.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.536
Whoever kiIIed him--
do you think he saw us?

24:14.620 --> 24:18.081
l mean, l felt like
we were being watched.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.749
lt's possible.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.544
Blood starts to coagulate
in four minutes.

24:22.628 --> 24:25.463
When l went to get the suitcase,
it was still fresh.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.385
- Then he could have been out there.
- I couIdn't Ieave it there.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.470
l mean, what if it
holds some sort of clue?

24:35.808 --> 24:38.560
- Let's open it.
- No.

24:38.644 --> 24:42.355
Let's just get to a phone
or a house or someplace.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.610
Joby: Malachai took us
right to Isaac.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.863
I figured he finaIIy
talked the little squirt

24:49.947 --> 24:51.990
into punishing us
for being unbelievers.

24:52.074 --> 24:55.076
Up till then, we'd been forgiven
'cause we weren't in the corn

24:55.161 --> 24:57.996
the day He Who Walks Behind the Rows
made himself known.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.248
That bothered Malachai.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.833
He had a lot of problems.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.084
( footsteps )

25:10.968 --> 25:13.386
I found these two
in one of the old homes.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.598
They had a game and music.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.727
And this.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.857
They come already.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.325
You have the gift of sight.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.244
This is a blessing, my child.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.413
Malachai: l've seen this car
upon the road.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.040
Go to the old man.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.709
Make sure
he tells them nothing.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.169
What about these two?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.761
Take them back
where they were.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.554
But they had a game
and music.

25:56.639 --> 25:59.641
- They're forbidden!
- Question me not, Malachai.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.143
l act according
to His wiII.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.065
( Sarah grunts )

26:19.995 --> 26:22.080
Ugh, you'd think
we were on the damn moon.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.539
We haven't even
seen a truck.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.083
We'll be
in Gatlin soon.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.588
You think
he lived there?

26:31.757 --> 26:33.132
We may never
know that.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.511
I reaIIy think
we should open it.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.848
Okay.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.859
Let's see if I
can get some news.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.987
Atone!

26:54.071 --> 26:57.615
Preacher: Only by the blood
of the Lamb are we saved!

26:57.700 --> 26:59.951
l'm getting tired
of that crap!

27:00.035 --> 27:01.786
( clasp releases )

27:06.542 --> 27:08.251
- Ugh!
- What is it?

27:12.298 --> 27:15.550
- Jesus Christ.
- Not in my book.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.554
Looks like some kind
of primitive foIk art.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.431
l think it's repulsive.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.814
Man:
Sarge, how about that number six?

27:36.655 --> 27:39.365
Oh damn it.
Better make it an eight.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.079
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

27:46.123 --> 27:51.002
( grunts )

27:52.212 --> 27:54.756
Oh, good boy, Sarge,

27:54.840 --> 27:57.633
We'll have that transmission
fixed in no time!

27:58.677 --> 28:00.345
Then we'll get on
the radiator.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.724
Damn, this road
is becoming a regular highway.

28:04.808 --> 28:08.186
Ain't this about the third car
in a month, huh?

28:09.271 --> 28:11.105
We know what to do,
don't we, boy?

28:20.908 --> 28:23.368
You'd better put
that suitcase away.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.873
Be right back.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.756
- Hi, we've had ourselves--
- I ain't got no gas.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.759
- No, I don't need gas.
- l ain't got no diesel if you all need it.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.886
Burt: No, you don't understand.
I need to use your--

28:41.970 --> 28:44.055
You don't buy no gas,
you can't use no restroom.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.724
( crow squawks )

28:46.809 --> 28:48.476
Your teIephone.
l need to use your phone.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.353
Telephone?!
l ain't got no telephone.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.896
- ( dog barks )
- Sarge.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.316
( Sarge continues barking )

28:55.401 --> 28:56.901
Sarge, you be still now.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.535
Mister,

29:05.619 --> 29:08.329
what you want to do
is to go to Hemingford.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.833
- About 19 miles down that right fork there.
- What about Gatlin?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.585
Gatlin? There ain't
nothin' in Gatlin.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.463
( Sarge barking )

29:17.548 --> 29:19.507
What do you mean
there ain't nothing in Gatlin?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.801
Folks in Gatlin's
got religion.

29:21.885 --> 29:26.013
They don't cotton to outsiders and
probably won't have a phone either.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.600
Sarge! Mister, l'd like to stay here
and shoot the breeze with you

29:29.685 --> 29:32.854
about poIitics and stuff,
but l got a transmission to fix.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.898
You get on that right fork there
and you'll be in Hemingford in no time.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.650
Right.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.193
- ( barks )
- Sarge.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.487
l said at ease!

29:41.572 --> 29:43.448
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- ( barks )

29:46.452 --> 29:47.994
- ( whimpers )
- Sarge!

29:49.413 --> 29:53.082
Either that man's senile or he's been
out in the sun too Iong.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.418
Sarge!

29:56.712 --> 29:58.171
- Come back here!
- ( barking )

29:58.255 --> 30:00.173
Sarge, get back here!

30:00.257 --> 30:02.175
l don't have time for this.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.930
You hear me?
Come back here.

30:08.015 --> 30:11.642
Come on.
That's an order!

30:12.644 --> 30:13.811
( metal thuds )

30:17.107 --> 30:19.108
( loud thunder )

30:22.654 --> 30:25.448
Who is it?
ls that you?

30:26.450 --> 30:28.326
What do you want?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.915
( crow squawks )

30:44.092 --> 30:45.676
( clanging )

30:45.761 --> 30:47.428
What are you
doing in there?

31:05.864 --> 31:08.783
There really isn't that much stuff in here.
Just kid's stuff--

31:08.867 --> 31:12.954
cIothes, matches,
compass, pocket knife.

31:13.038 --> 31:16.874
- l don't get it, camping stuff?
- Yeah.

31:17.876 --> 31:21.629
Oh great.
This must be our day.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.674
Didn't the Iast sign
we saw say Gatlin was three miles

31:24.758 --> 31:26.968
- and point that way?
- That's what l thought.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.303
Did l miss a turn?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.180
No, we've been
going straight.

31:32.474 --> 31:35.309
Somebody's been messing
with these signs then.

31:35.394 --> 31:39.272
- Hemingford's gotta be straight ahead.
- Yeah.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.573
Must have been
the wind.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.854
Those Iatches
ain't worth a damn.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.523
Blow over in a bad fart.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.030
( children's laughter )

32:29.114 --> 32:32.325
( thunder )

32:35.203 --> 32:37.038
l never told them nothing.

32:37.122 --> 32:41.459
I swear it.
l kept our bargain just like always.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.798
Burt:
Jesus Christ.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.551
Gatlin! What do they have a monopoly
on road signs?

32:50.636 --> 32:52.762
What about Hemingford?

32:52.846 --> 32:56.432
For people who don't like visitors,
they sure do advertise enough.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.479
Over there.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.444
Of course,
it's the wind.

33:13.867 --> 33:16.243
( grunting )

33:39.393 --> 33:42.395
Why did you have
to go after them, Sarge?

33:53.657 --> 33:55.991
Why you bastards.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.327
You can't do this to me.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.874
( grunts )

34:26.231 --> 34:27.940
l know you're in here.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.614
Come on.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.076
Come on!

34:50.714 --> 34:53.174
I can smeII you,
you stinkin' little skunks.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.592
Come on!

35:02.392 --> 35:05.436
You murdering
little devils.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.398
Come on!

35:31.338 --> 35:32.671
( thump )

35:33.673 --> 35:35.007
Vicky:
What was that?

35:35.091 --> 35:37.301
( exhales )
That probably was just my golf bag.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.137
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean am l sure?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.998
God, this isn't
even a road.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.501
- We're never gonna get out of here.
- We will too, now stop it!

36:13.129 --> 36:15.005
Sorry.

36:17.259 --> 36:20.344
- Just tell me where we are.
- l don't know.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.943
We're right back
where we started from.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.696
We never shouId have
listened to that old fool.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.950
Hemingford's 19 miles.
Gatlin's only three.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.702
l don't care how much religion
they've got,

36:44.786 --> 36:45.870
we're going there
right now.

36:47.622 --> 36:50.124
Don't ever show up
in my emergency room, buddy.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.270
Behold.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.148
A dream did come to me in
the night.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.902
And the Lord did show
all this to me.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.779
Crowd: Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

37:20.864 --> 37:23.574
A time of tribulation
has come.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.577
A test is at hand.

37:28.121 --> 37:31.874
- The finaI test.
- What has the Lord commanded?

37:31.958 --> 37:35.836
ln the dream,
the Lord did come to me

37:35.921 --> 37:37.630
And He was a shape.

37:37.714 --> 37:40.424
lt was He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.844
And I did faII
on my knees in terror,

37:43.929 --> 37:45.471
and hide my eyes,

37:45.555 --> 37:48.182
lest the fierceness of
His face strike me dead!

37:48.266 --> 37:51.352
And He told me all
that has since happened.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.229
- He said,
- ( baby crying )

37:54.314 --> 37:57.608
"Joseph has taken his things
and fIed this happy pIace,

37:57.692 --> 38:01.445
because the worship
of Me is no more upon him.

38:02.864 --> 38:06.533
So take you his life
and spill his blood."

38:06.618 --> 38:08.869
- He did?
- Yeah.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.206
"But let not the flesh
pollute the corn.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.668
- Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so it was done!

38:15.752 --> 38:18.796
Joseph the betrayer
was cast out.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.216
And He Who WaIks
Behind the Rows did say,

38:22.300 --> 38:25.511
"I wiII send
outlanders amongst you,

38:25.595 --> 38:28.138
a man and a woman.

38:28.223 --> 38:31.225
And these outlanders
wiII be unbeIievers

38:31.309 --> 38:32.685
and profaners
of the hoIy."

38:32.769 --> 38:35.396
I wish Isaac
never came here.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.814
But he's always been here,

38:36.898 --> 38:39.733
just like He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.152
"And the man shall
soreIy test you.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.363
For he has great power,

38:44.447 --> 38:47.157
Even greater than
that of the blue man!"

38:47.242 --> 38:50.995
Crowd: The blue man.
Yes, the blue man.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.748
And just as the bIue man
was offered up unto Him,

38:54.833 --> 38:58.002
so shall be the unbelievers.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.045
Malachai:
Make sacrifice unto Him.

39:00.130 --> 39:03.298
Bring Him the blood
of the outIanders.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.718
( all chanting )
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

39:05.802 --> 39:08.512
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

39:08.596 --> 39:11.432
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

39:11.516 --> 39:14.101
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

39:14.185 --> 39:16.770
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

39:16.855 --> 39:18.522
( whispers )
Let's get out of here.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.276
( chanting continues )

40:01.149 --> 40:02.941
lt looks like
a swinging place.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.417
l guess nobody told them
we were coming.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.670
- l hope not.
- ( scoffs )

40:24.923 --> 40:27.132
God, l don't see anybody.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.681
Town hall.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.309
Grocery store.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.938
Hansen's Cafe.
Let's see if they've got a phone, huh?

40:42.190 --> 40:44.525
- Unless a ghost is using it.
- ( chuckles )

41:11.886 --> 41:14.930
What is it
with this corn?

41:15.014 --> 41:17.224
You got me.

41:20.395 --> 41:21.812
Phew.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.831
( hangs up phone )
It's dead.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.583
Just like everything else
around here.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.251
- ( squeals )
- Yuck!

41:45.670 --> 41:47.546
- A rat.
- Yeah.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.382
Just your ordinary
coffee shop rat.

41:51.426 --> 41:53.343
Now can we get
out of here, please?

41:55.180 --> 41:56.513
Hey.

41:56.598 --> 41:59.016
Hey hey, wait a minute.
Come back here!

41:59.100 --> 42:01.727
Come on, Vicky.
Hurry up, l don't want to lose them.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.529
( tires screeching )

42:16.034 --> 42:17.910
So what are you
gonna do if you catch them?

42:17.994 --> 42:19.745
Ask them where
we could find help, what else?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.248
- They cut off that way.
- Okay.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.711
Burt:
Damn it. Where'd they go?

42:29.797 --> 42:32.132
Look, we're already
in the car.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.135
Why don't we go on to Hemingford?
It'II take us 20 minutes.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.637
We just found people.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.640
Yeah, three kids who tried
to steal our car.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.186
There's something
very strange about this town.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.565
( sighs )
Maybe you're right.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.611
Burt: We'd be better off
in a bigger town anyway.

42:52.695 --> 42:56.573
- The size of Seattle.
- Vicky: Yeah.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.876
- Over there.
- What?

43:07.961 --> 43:10.754
l just saw a door
open and close.

43:10.838 --> 43:13.048
l didn't see anything.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.676
Let's check it out.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.761
Why? l thought
we were going!

43:17.845 --> 43:19.554
Settle down.
Jeez.

43:19.639 --> 43:22.307
- Don't patronize me, Burt.
- l'm not patronizing you.

43:22.392 --> 43:24.643
l just want to see
if somebody's there.

43:32.026 --> 43:42.452
Hello?

43:46.082 --> 43:47.749
Anybody home?

43:50.712 --> 43:53.213
We've had an accident and we need
to use your phone.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.218
Okay?
Now can we go?

44:04.392 --> 44:05.892
Burt, this is
somebody's house!

44:05.977 --> 44:07.519
I know, I just want
to use their phone.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.521
Burt: Hello?

44:38.259 --> 44:40.052
Gross.

44:42.638 --> 44:44.222
l'm going to check
out back.

44:58.154 --> 44:59.571
l found the phone.

45:01.574 --> 45:04.284
lt matches the decor perfectly.

45:04.369 --> 45:05.952
This is three years old.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.667
l don't understand
what's going on here.

45:14.087 --> 45:16.463
Well, can we go?

45:16.547 --> 45:17.714
( thump )

45:24.263 --> 45:25.931
( whispers )
Burt.

45:44.784 --> 45:46.118

45:58.506 --> 46:00.924
( stairs creaking )

47:00.109 --> 47:01.526
( both gasp )

47:04.906 --> 47:07.324
( guitar music playing )

47:18.377 --> 47:22.547
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.

47:22.632 --> 47:24.841
Hi.

47:27.345 --> 47:30.931
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

47:31.015 --> 47:34.476
Oh, Sarah.
That's a beautiful name.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.103
This is Burt
and l'm Vicky.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.647
Are you here alone, Sarah?

47:41.359 --> 47:42.692
Do you live here?

47:44.570 --> 47:47.155
You just come here
to play?

47:49.659 --> 47:51.785
Are your mommy
and daddy around?

47:51.869 --> 47:55.205
- They're in the cornfield.
- Oh.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.748
What are they
doing there?

47:56.832 --> 47:58.917
All the grown-ups
are there.

47:59.001 --> 48:02.671
Are they working there
or are they having a meeting?

48:02.755 --> 48:06.758
No, lsaac put

48:06.842 --> 48:08.260

48:11.973 --> 48:14.015

48:14.100 --> 48:16.017
Our leader.

48:16.102 --> 48:17.602
Leader of what?

48:19.355 --> 48:21.273
Of everybody.

48:21.357 --> 48:23.650
Of course.

48:28.990 --> 48:31.283
Listen, could you
take us to lsaac?

48:31.367 --> 48:33.785
- Huh-uh.
- Vicky: Why not?

48:33.869 --> 48:35.203
He's scary.

48:35.288 --> 48:37.789
Look, Sarah,
it's very important

48:37.873 --> 48:40.292
that we speak to some
grown-ups as soon as possible.

48:40.376 --> 48:42.043
We're wasting
our time here, Vicky.

48:42.128 --> 48:43.920
Well, give her a chance.

48:44.005 --> 48:45.964
l'm gonna go look
at the town haII.

48:47.383 --> 48:48.883
Why?

48:48.968 --> 48:51.803
Because we have
a murder to report.

48:51.887 --> 48:54.973
And we're standing here
talking in circles wasting our time.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.808
Maybe she can help.

48:56.892 --> 48:58.727
Well, fine, then you
stay here with her.

49:01.772 --> 49:04.608
Listen, things just
aren't happening fast enough.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.943
So I'm gonna
leave you the car.

49:07.028 --> 49:08.403
l won't be gone very long.

49:08.487 --> 49:11.156
lf anybody comes,
just honk, okay?

49:15.578 --> 49:17.287
Are we safe?

49:18.706 --> 49:21.583
Yeah, it's a little weird
here, but it's safe.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.210
l'll be back.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.981
So Iooks Iike
it's just you and me.

49:47.151 --> 49:50.153
What were you doing here by yourself?
Just pIaying records?

49:52.657 --> 49:54.616
Come on, you can tell me.

49:57.453 --> 50:00.121
- Drawing
- Drawing.

50:00.206 --> 50:02.916
What's so secret
about drawing?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.210
l'm not supposed to.

50:05.294 --> 50:07.170
You're not supposed
to draw?

50:08.714 --> 50:11.299
Who says?
Isaac?

50:11.384 --> 50:13.259
Malachai.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.345
Malachai?

50:16.347 --> 50:17.639
Well, l'll tell you what.

50:17.723 --> 50:19.015
Why don't you draw me
a picture

50:19.100 --> 50:21.768
And we won't teII Isaac
or Malachai or anybody?

50:21.852 --> 50:24.354
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

53:42.303 --> 53:46.472
- So how's it coming, huh?
- Fine.

53:47.975 --> 53:50.393
- What did you draw?
- You.

53:50.477 --> 53:53.479
You did?
Could l see?

54:03.324 --> 54:05.033
What is this?

54:05.117 --> 54:07.160
( stairs creak )

54:07.244 --> 54:08.995
Burt?

54:16.378 --> 54:39.734
Burt, is that you?

54:42.571 --> 54:44.322
Vicky:
ls somebody here?

54:48.911 --> 54:50.203
Who are you?

54:51.956 --> 54:53.498
What do you want?

54:56.961 --> 54:59.963
We want
to give you peace.

55:01.924 --> 55:03.967
Seize her.

55:04.051 --> 55:05.635
Boy:
Come on, get her.

55:17.147 --> 55:19.107
Come out of there.

55:23.112 --> 55:24.278
Sarah!

55:42.214 --> 55:43.798
- No!
- ( indistinct chuckling )

55:44.967 --> 55:46.342
Vicky: No!

55:48.679 --> 55:51.597
Burt! No!

55:55.894 --> 55:58.604
Vicky's voice:
Are we safe?

55:58.689 --> 56:01.274
Burt's voice:
lt's weird here, but it's safe.

56:01.358 --> 56:04.652
( both voices repeating )

56:04.737 --> 56:06.029
Vicky.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.788
( Vicky screaming )
Help me!

56:15.873 --> 56:18.082
Where are you
taking me?

56:21.295 --> 56:23.087
Burt!

56:23.172 --> 56:25.715
- Burt! No!
- ( Sarah crying )

56:39.063 --> 56:40.605
Vicky!

56:46.612 --> 56:48.946
Sarah, what
happened here, huh?

56:50.032 --> 56:52.325
What happened?
Where's Vicky?

56:52.409 --> 56:54.660
You've gotta think.
Now think.

56:54.745 --> 56:56.245
What happened
to her, please?

57:01.543 --> 57:02.919
Does He speak
to you, Isaac?

57:03.003 --> 57:06.089
He speaks to me always.

57:06.173 --> 57:08.341
But today He is
dispIeased.

57:08.425 --> 57:12.011
He is displeased
with you, Malachai.

57:12.096 --> 57:13.846
What have l done?

57:13.931 --> 57:16.099
Question Him not in vain.

57:16.183 --> 57:19.060
Do you not know you did sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?

57:19.144 --> 57:22.188
And did you not
spill the blood of the old man

57:22.272 --> 57:24.774
when his oil and gasoline were
still useful to us?

57:24.858 --> 57:27.193
We have our own
fuel now from the corn.

57:27.277 --> 57:30.863
Show not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.

57:33.784 --> 57:37.036
Maybe He is dispIeased
we have not offered Him Sarah and Job.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.789
Sarah has the gift of sight.

57:39.873 --> 57:43.543
She warned us of the coming
of the interIopers.

57:43.627 --> 57:46.212
Question not my judgment,
MaIachai.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.840
l am the giver
of His word.

57:51.927 --> 57:53.886
Go you and bring me
the husband.

57:53.971 --> 57:56.514
l must offer them tonight
when Amos leaves.

58:00.394 --> 58:03.437
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her, please.

58:04.690 --> 58:07.316
Sarah, look at me.
Now think.

58:07.401 --> 58:09.152
- ( whispers ) Malachai.
- What?

58:09.236 --> 58:12.530
- MaIachai.
- Who's Malachai? What do you mean?

58:13.532 --> 58:14.657
Huh?

58:24.835 --> 58:26.127
No.

58:31.133 --> 58:47.356
Vicky?

58:58.869 --> 59:00.328
Vicky's voice:
Oh my God!

59:06.251 --> 59:08.419
( bell tolling )

59:10.756 --> 59:13.549
( roaring )

59:22.559 --> 59:26.145
( crowd cheering )

59:38.408 --> 59:41.327
( screams )

59:43.413 --> 59:46.457
( crowd chanting )
KiII kiII kiII kiII...

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.729
( bell tolling )

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:36.257
( bell continues tolling )

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:50.521
Now the blood
of Amos will be shared!

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.232
Stop it!
Stop that!

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.651
- Woman: What?
- Hold the outlander!

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.659
What the heII's
going on here?

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.704
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:09.206
My passage,
it's my birthday.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:12.084
You got a pretty sick way
of ceIebrating it, paI.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.212
- Listen, l--
- Silence, interloper!

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:18.966
Your presence does
profane this holy place.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:20.968
He will reckon with you!

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.928
That's terrific.
l don't know who he is,

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.848
but maybe he'd like to discuss the medical
side of what's going on here with me.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.016
- lt's as it should be.
- Amos!

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.517
lt's as it is written.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:29.894
GirI:
Speak no more to him!

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:33.606
He is an unbeliever.
Hurry, get lsaac.

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.108
No, wait.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.444
Bring Malachai.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.488
( all gasping )

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:46.702
So what do you mean,
"as it is written"? Written where?

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:54.460
What, in this?

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.838
You rewriting the whole thing orjust
the parts that suit your needs?

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:05.805
( girl grunts )

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:06.889
- ( groans )
- Back off, fellas.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.224
GirI:
Sit down!

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:10.101
( grunts )

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.061
Burt:
What do we have here?

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:15.981
19, 19 year--
what is this?

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.025
These peopIe
all died so young.

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.444
Amos:
Not die. We go to Him

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:22.405
- on the first night of our 19th year.
- Crowd: YEAH!

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:24.031
Who the hell's him?

01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:25.699
He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.701
Girl #2:
Malachai comes!

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.454

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:33.207
- Girl: Seize him!

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:38.212
( crowd gasps )

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:39.880
Girl whispers:
Stay back.

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:43.259
- GirI #2: No!
- ( crowd screaming )

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.137
Come on, hurry up.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:58.274
Get him. Do not
let him escape!

01:02:58.358 --> 01:02:59.775
Boy: Get him!
Kill him!

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.161
- Let's go. Get him!
- Where is he? Come on!

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:11.412
He went
around the corner!

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.372
( screaming )

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:16.459
There he is.
Go get him, you guys. Go that way.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.426
He's getting away!

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.598
( screaming )

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.105
Girl: l need your help.

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.066
Come on!
Help me, help me!

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.527
Outlander!
Hey!

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:45.571
- He's here.
- There he is.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.655
Come on.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.242
Get him.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:02.046
- GirI: Got you this time.
- Burt: This isn't a game, understand?

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:05.841
Back off.
Get out of here.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.223
Outlander!

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:14.892
Go get him!

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:16.810
( children screaming )

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.607
Down the alley.

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:29.865
Damn it!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.453
Check the door.
Check the doors.

01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:42.461
You guys,
go back up the alley.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.713
You, over there.
You two, follow me.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.105
Shit.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:55.284
( grunts )

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.661
Damn it.

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.426
( groans )

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:19.683
Psst.
Hey, mister.

01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:22.645
l know a place
to hide.

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.063
But we gotta hurry.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:26.065
- Who are you?
- Job.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.609
Come on.
Stop asking questions.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:35.991
Come on.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.954
Will you come on?

01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:57.388
Careful.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.973
Hey, don't be
a scaredy cat.

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:05.104
- Come on. lt's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:07.439
Yeah, my sister.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.779
lsn't this neat?
My dad buiIt it

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.490
for when the communists
launch their first strike.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:21.036
l don't think it's the communists
we have to worry about.

01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:24.331
Don't worry.
Nobody knows about this place.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.334
lt's secret.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:29.837
- Are those guys friends of yours?
- No way.

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:32.548
They listen to lsaac
and MaIachai.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:34.967
Who are lsaac
and Malachai?

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.094
lsaac started
the whole thing.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:39.972
If he hadn't had come,
this would never have happened.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:43.100
When he was young, he was a preacher,
so everybody believed him.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:45.811
They thought he had
great spirit.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.313
l thought he was weird,
huh, Sarah?

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.785
We must sacrifice
them both tonight.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.496
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:05.748
She'll bring the man to us.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:08.876
No, he must be
taken without her.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.920
We cannot remove her
from this place. lt is holy.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.298
We will bring the Lord
two by using one.

01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:16.508
Do not blaspheme,
MaIachai!

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.636
You know not the Iaws.
He speaks them only to me.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.973
I think not, Isaac.
You're the one who's lost favor with Him.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:26.435
He's the god of blood and sacrifice,
not ceremony.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:29.313
Ah, sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:30.939
Shut your mouth, lsaac.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.024
You've grown prideful
and apart from us.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.569
Girl:
Oh my gosh. Oh no.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:38.197
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
wiII decide your fate.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:41.575
Don't just sit there.
Seize him!

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:44.077
Punish him!
Cut him down! l command you!

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.872
l am the word and the giver
of His Iaws.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.207
Disobedience to me
is disobedience to Him.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.877
Do it now or your punishment shall be
a thousand times a thousand deaths.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.712
Each more horrible
than the Iast.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.715
They are tired
of your talk, lsaac.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.258
l have shown them
what I can do.

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:00.551
Cut the woman down.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.386
Put lsaac in her place.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.890
You will see how
the Lord favors you.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.059
No, you dare not.
You blaspheme.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.520
He wiII punish you.
The god of hell will devour you.

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:12.689
All of you! No!

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:16.193
( screaming )

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:18.362
When my dad
wouldn't get up,

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:21.365
l ran from Hansen's
to get Officer Hotchkiss.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:23.742
But l was too late.

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:25.743
Why, what happened to him?

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.703
He got away...
that time.

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:30.916
Then he went down to the barn
after he taIked to the minister.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.961
The minister?
What happened to the minister?

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:35.295
Malachai.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:41.134
MaIachai:
Outlander!

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:44.513
Outlander!

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:48.517
Get over there.
He's gonna come. Get over there.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.854
- Boy: You come with me down this street.
- Outlander!

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.276
Outlander!

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.530
We have your woman.
She stiII Iives.

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:06.201
Outlander, maybe you don't
hear so weII.

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:08.704
( screams )
Burt!

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:12.165
Outlander,
her blood will spill

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.251
unless you give
yourseIf up.

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.129
We won't wait
much Ionger.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:21.174
Night is coming.
Night is His time.

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.427
Outlander!

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.095
Come on!
Come on!

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.472
Come on, outlander!

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.058
( faintly echoing )
Come on!

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:32.603
Outlander!

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:38.942
Are you looking
for that Iady?

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.611
Yeah, you know
where she is?

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.739
- They took her out to the clearing.
- What clearing? Where?

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:45.824
ln the cornfield.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.452
- Are you sure?
- Of course, l'm sure.

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.871
- l followed them like l followed you.
- Show me.

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:55.709
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:56.835
Okay.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.383
- ( hinges squeak )
- ( whispers ) Quiet.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.430
Come on.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.184
Follow me to the barn.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.478
Careful.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.369
l'm ready to celebrate
my birthday.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.621
Isaac:
Malachai, He will not forgive you!

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.790
None of you
will be forgiven!

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.708
All of you
shall feel His wrath!

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.877
- ( screaming continues )
- We have a surprise for you, Amos.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:41.338
You morons. Don't you understand
what he's trying to do?

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.298
lsaac's going
to keep you company.

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:45.425
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
wiII decide your fate.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.220
l am the word and the giver
of His Iaws!

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.847
This is the end!

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:19.584
( Joby whispering )
Come on.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.841
Come in through here.

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:30.804
You can see
everything from here.

01:12:39.647 --> 01:12:40.897
Okay, you two.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.443
You stay here
and wait for me, all right?

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.153
But if anything
happens to me,

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:49.281
you get to Hemingford
as fast as you can.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.576
You get on that road
and don't get off, understand?

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:54.828
Uh-huh.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.212
Go past
the irrigation pump.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:44.044
Amos: lt's him.

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:52.302
He's come for me.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:56.556
He's come
to welcome me.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:05.732
Children:
Go to him, Amos!

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:12.405
l'm here, Lord!

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:15.534
l'm ready.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:18.286
Take me now, Lord.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.374
Your will, Lord.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.626
Thy message.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.305
( creature roaring )

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.728
lsaac:
l did as You commanded.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.730
l was good.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.401
l swear it.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:53.280
l did everything
You wanted.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.286
- ( creature whispering )
- No!

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:07.085
No!

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.463
( shrieking )

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.098
Boy:
lt's the outlander!

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.267
Come on, go.
Run to the barn.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.603
ChiId:
Get him!

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:27.772
- ( grunting )
- Get him!

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.441
Help Malachai!

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.527
- Get him.
- He came back.

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:36.031
Vicky, get out of here.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:38.575
Was this how it was
with your parents, huh?

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:39.784
Was it?

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.538
Just because some
self-proclaimed holy man

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:46.041
said this is what
God commands?

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.627
Boy: So?

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:51.796
What kind of a god tells his children
to kiII their parents, huh?

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.089
Answer me that, buddy.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:55.550
Did you ever hear
of that before lsaac?

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:56.968
Did you?

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.056
l can't believe
you're this blind.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.020
Maybe you've been listening to these
holy rollers so long,

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:10.649
it's all starting to sound the same.
WeII, it's not!

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.318
- Child #2: What's he talking about?
- Burt: Any religion...

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.528
without Iove
and compassion...

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:17.405
is false!

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:20.408
- It's a Iie!
- ( Malachai screams )

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:00.699
Child #3:
Did he kill Malachai?

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.539
ls this what
you want, huh?

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.624
ls this what He
commands?

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.463
- ( Burt grunts )
- ( knife thumps )

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:17.132
( crowd gasping )

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:21.720
l don't think so.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:23.179
Get him.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.850
Malachai:
Stop him.

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.268
Get him.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.772
( distorted voice yells )
MaIachai!

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:36.568
- ( crowd gasping )
- Child #4: Oh my God! lsaac!

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.405
( in demonic voice )
He wants you too...

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.240
Malachai!

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:49.080
He wants you too.

01:17:55.546 --> 01:17:57.088
( growling )

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.432
( bone cracks )

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:15.440
- Boy: Use these!
- ( loud thunderclap )

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.651
ChiId:
Should we board this up?

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:20.904
( Child #2 screams )

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:27.702
( children crying )

01:18:27.787 --> 01:18:29.871
- Burt: Vicky?
- Burt?

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:32.499
Joby: Over here.
You're hurt.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.919
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:37.921
- ( Ioud thunder )
- ( strong gust of wind )

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:39.714
Get down.
Get down.

01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:43.301
Joby, get some help
and get those doors closed, quick.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:45.804
- Joby: Peter, Robert, come on.
- Vicky: What do we do?

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.305
Burt:
l don't know.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.265
lf l knew what it was,
l could tell you.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:52.352
lt's He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:54.979
What if we tried to run for it
and make it to the road?

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.565
l think we're
safer here for now.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:01.653
( screaming )

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.658
Joby, has anybody
ever tried to hurt the monster?

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.660
Any of the adults?
The parents before they were killed?

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.078
The blue man.

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:12.247
Who's the blue man?
What did he do?

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:14.666
Officer Hotchkiss.
l told you.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.585
He came down here after
he talked to the minister.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.171
He was reading a page
torn out of the Bible

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:22.424
- and he was working with the still.
- Wait a minute.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:24.676
( all scream )

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:27.971
Why was he reading out of the Bible?
What was it?

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:30.515
Do you know?
You have it?

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:32.684
Hurry up.
Where is it?

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:36.020
Child:
lt's all Malachai's fault!

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:38.022
"And the devil
that deceived them

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.442
was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:44.612
where the beast and the false prophet
are and shall be tormented

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:47.115
day and night
forever and ever."

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.450
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:57.375
Job, what was
the blue man doing at the still?

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.087
He hooked the hose up
to it and was trying to roll it out.

01:20:01.172 --> 01:20:04.382
- What stopped him?
- Both: MaIachai.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:08.344
"Lake of fire." Fire!
He was going to burn the field.

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:12.182
Oh, yes.
The gasohol. The still.

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:14.142
- How?
- Never mind, never mind.

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:17.312
You kids, get me as many hoses
as you can find, quick!

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.399
Job and Sarah,
find me a bottle, a glass one.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:23.526
A pop bottIe.
Quick, move.

01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:25.403
Vicky, come here.

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:29.365
- Child #2: Over here.
- Child #3: l can't find anything.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.079
( child screams )

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.998
lt doesn't fit.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.501
There's gotta be a connector
around here somewhere.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.545
Try these.

01:20:54.934 --> 01:20:57.310
Get somebody
to hold this on tight.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:00.271
- Okay!
- Hang on to it.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.232
You got one, good.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:07.946
Vicky, see if you can find me
a thick rag.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.781
Joby, come here.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.867
Hey, that's not a rag.

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:17.539
Sheesh.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.166
Okay.

01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:23.503
Now get them to hold
onto that tight.

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:26.256
- Open it up when l get out there, all right?
- All right.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.509
Burt, be careful.

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:33.054
- I Iove you, Vicky.
- Child: l wish we'd never done this.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:35.139
Okay.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.791
Ow.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.336
Ow!

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:11.134
( grunting )

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:24.105
( creature howling )

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:35.533
What are you doing here?
Get back to the barn. Hurry up.

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:39.120
Go on, move. Now.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:46.294
Excuse me.

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:08.775
Joby, get that valve.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:11.027
Quick.

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:22.830
Joby, do you know how
to run this thing?

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:25.041
- Crank it.
- What?

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.376
Crank it.

01:23:35.302 --> 01:23:37.679
Push the button
at the top.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:39.889
Yeah.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520
All right.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:05.289
- Get the bottle.
- Okay.

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:24.434
Come here.
Block the wind.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:33.651
( grunts )

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:43.661
Joby! Joby!
Come back here.

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:45.079
You'll get killed.

01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:55.715
Joby!

01:25:03.182 --> 01:25:06.476
Run. Come on.
Run, Joby.

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:09.520
Here's the bottle!

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:12.815
Throw it.
Throw right this time.

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:16.486
Throw it.
Throw it.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.467

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:47.975

Joby!

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:02.657

- Burt: l think so.

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:41.404
- Then why are we still running?
- Just keep going.

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:43.656
Vicky:
Where did you get this guy?

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:16.981
( sighs )
Well, Hemingford's 19 miles, right?

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.651
Vicky:
