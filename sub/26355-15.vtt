12:06.739 --> 12:07.740
On the Richter scale!

12:08.824 --> 12:10.575

12:10.576 --> 12:13.286
I get to go again.
We do it twice.

Oh.

Let's go, Courtney.

12:33.391 --> 12:35.141
So, you liking
Take Your Daughter to Work Day?

12:35.142 --> 12:36.643
Uh, yeah!

12:36.644 --> 12:39.396
I can't believe my dad knows
how to fly this thing.

12:39.397 --> 12:42.440
- You want to try?
- Me? I don't know.

12:42.441 --> 12:43.650
Come on, it's easy.

12:43.651 --> 12:45.318
You don't even need
a college degree,

12:45.319 --> 12:48.155
which is a very scary true fact.
Go ahead.

12:50.157 --> 12:51.575
You're doing great. Now roll it.

12:51.576 --> 12:53.660
What? No way.

12:53.661 --> 12:56.496
Don't worry, you're a Quagmire.
It's in your blood.

12:56.497 --> 12:58.624

- Okay.

13:00.793 --> 13:03.753

He's not doing it today.

13:09.385 --> 13:11.261
- Aw, shoot.
- Another time.

13:11.262 --> 13:12.763
Probably got his kid with him.

13:16.517 --> 13:19.060
I'm glad you guys could finally
come over for dinner.

13:19.061 --> 13:20.854
Sure thing, Lois.
Thanks for having us.

13:20.855 --> 13:23.940
See, Meg?
That's a thigh gap.

13:23.941 --> 13:26.568
Now, Courtney, I'd like
to awkwardly introduce you

13:26.569 --> 13:27.986
to someone your own age.

13:27.987 --> 13:29.571
Courtney, this is Megan.

13:29.572 --> 13:31.156
Maybe you listen
to the same music.

13:31.157 --> 13:32.407
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:32.408 --> 13:33.617
Yo, Courtney,
what's your Instagram?

13:33.618 --> 13:34.909
I just got on there

13:34.910 --> 13:36.620
and need some interesting peeps
to follow.

13:36.621 --> 13:38.872
Oh, you'll have to ask my dad.

13:38.873 --> 13:40.999
He approves
all my follow requests.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.877
Denied! Nice try, ass.

13:43.878 --> 13:46.212
Hey, have you guys seen
the Wonder Woman film?

13:46.213 --> 13:48.048
- Yeah, no.
- Oh, you have to.

13:48.049 --> 13:49.174
It's a triumph.

13:49.175 --> 13:50.925
Courts and I
have seen it five times.

13:50.926 --> 13:52.719
It's an important movie, Peter.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.180
You should watch it with Meg.
It's a masterwork.

13:55.181 --> 13:57.015
Oh, I've been wanting
to see that.

13:57.016 --> 13:58.476
Okay, we totally will.

Hey, Dad,
I just checked the weather,

14:01.979 --> 14:04.814
and it looks like sunny skies
all weekend.

14:04.815 --> 14:07.400
- You guys have big plans?
- Yeah, we're going camping.

Okay, here's one.
I call it "The Invisible Noose."

17:25.974 --> 17:27.976
First, I throw a rope
over this tree limb,

17:27.977 --> 17:29.477
put the noose around my neck.

17:29.478 --> 17:31.563
Now I'll just step
onto this rock

17:31.564 --> 17:34.233
and jump off into
the sweet relief of death.

17:38.487 --> 17:40.947
Peter, would you mind
flattening your rod?

17:40.948 --> 17:43.741
Fine. I'll Tootsie it
between my thighs.

17:43.742 --> 17:46.912
Yeah, okay, whatever gets it
away from my daughter's face.

17:52.209 --> 17:54.419
Are you eating an apple

We've changed our minds.
We're going on record.

18:08.017 --> 18:09.434

Hey, here comes a hiker.

18:17.026 --> 18:19.193
Excuse me, sir, we're lost.

Ha! Then you must be
my car keys, right?

I didn't get us lost.

two dads in the woods,

very, very much.

Well, you chose it. I didn't.
