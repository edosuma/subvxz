[narrator]
Previously onHalo...

00:01.653 --> 00:03.264
Strap in.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.572
[speaking alien language]

00:15.102 --> 00:17.234
[Soren]
Put your weapons down.

00:17.278 --> 00:20.672
If John here wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.587
Hello, Soren.
This is Kwan Ha.

00:22.631 --> 00:23.936
Nice of you to drop by.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.808
I've developed a new system

00:25.851 --> 00:27.940
which will overwrite
Spartan consciousness

00:27.984 --> 00:31.770
and replace it with our
artificial general intelligence.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.120
It's called Cortana.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.469
Didn't that process depend

00:34.512 --> 00:36.036
on the illegal practice

00:36.079 --> 00:37.472
of flash-cloning humans?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.519
-What does it do?
-I'm not sure.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.869
[Riz] Slipspace vector tracking
on the Condor just came in.

00:43.913 --> 00:46.350
We won't have his exact
location, but we'll be close.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.178
[Soren]
What they did to us,

00:48.222 --> 00:50.876
it's only permanent
if we choose to let it be.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.487
That pellet you got
on your back,

00:52.530 --> 00:54.010
it mutes everything.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.446
Lose the pellet

00:55.490 --> 00:58.449
and it's like
opening your eyes.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.450
[soft chuckle]

00:59.494 --> 01:00.973
[screams]

01:01.017 --> 01:03.976
You bring it to life.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.282
What do you mean?

01:05.326 --> 01:06.544
You are different

01:06.588 --> 01:07.806
than the one they have.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.069
The one they have?

01:09.112 --> 01:10.548
[speaking alien language]

01:13.464 --> 01:14.944
The ring is what they want!

01:14.987 --> 01:16.902
-What is that ring?
-The end...

01:16.946 --> 01:19.557
of life as we know it.

01:19.601 --> 01:20.993
I have to go back.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.865
[Soren]
You running back to Halsey.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.301
-You can't just leave me here.
-Promise me.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.956
-Keep her safe.
-I give you my word.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.482
-[Halsey] Why did you come back?
-There was no one I could trust.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.484
You made the right choice.

01:33.528 --> 01:37.053
We're gonna do
great things together.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.690
[man, over PA system]
Metals and plastics

02:05.734 --> 02:07.518
are to be kept separate.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.390
Contaminated bags
will be rejected

02:09.433 --> 02:11.000
and extra shifts imposed.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.393
[man] Come on,
let's go faster.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.438
[man 2] Let's go,
you little bastards!

02:14.482 --> 02:15.657
Move!

02:15.700 --> 02:17.311
Come on, let's go faster.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.747
Hurry up!

02:18.790 --> 02:19.922
[Det]
"They ran among the broad

02:19.965 --> 02:22.794
"Ma-Margolia trees,

02:22.838 --> 02:25.319
"and when she turned to him,
he took her up.

02:25.362 --> 02:28.235
"This was a new frontier
for Jack,

02:28.278 --> 02:32.761
"one not made of the great
forest or high 'moon-tains,'

02:32.804 --> 02:35.807
"but something more vast,

02:35.851 --> 02:37.766
"more unknowable:

02:37.809 --> 02:40.290
the heart of an untamed woman."

02:41.639 --> 02:43.163
What's "untamed" mean?

02:43.206 --> 02:46.731
I think it's like
she's really pretty.

02:46.775 --> 02:47.732
[man]
You!

02:47.776 --> 02:49.343
Shh!

02:49.386 --> 02:51.519
[man on PA] The next shift day
has been extended...

02:53.260 --> 02:55.349
Do you like it?

02:55.392 --> 02:56.524
I love it.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.919
It's a story about a whole
different world.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.921
What do you mean?

03:02.965 --> 03:07.230
There are other planets
with bright light in the sky,

03:07.274 --> 03:08.623
and tall trees,

03:08.666 --> 03:11.278
and green grass
you can walk on.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.627
[sighs]
I don't know.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.759
-Really?
-It's in the book.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.590
Look here. Do you know
what that word says?

03:19.634 --> 03:21.026
"Kiss."

03:21.070 --> 03:23.812
So, when you read
a word like that,

03:23.855 --> 03:26.467
someone's supposed to kiss you.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.697
[man]
Hey!

03:39.741 --> 03:41.046
Get back to work!

03:41.090 --> 03:42.309
-[Det] Run!
-[man] Let's go!

03:42.352 --> 03:44.136
Hey!

03:44.180 --> 03:45.399
Get over here!

03:47.096 --> 03:48.793
Come back here,
you little shit!

03:59.674 --> 04:01.806

-Stop it!

04:01.850 --> 04:03.852
-Stop it!
-Forget it!

04:03.895 --> 04:05.506
-Det!
-Let's go!

04:05.549 --> 04:06.855
[Makee, crying]
No.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.996

Grab her!

04:25.177 --> 04:26.396
I've gotcha!

04:26.440 --> 04:27.484
[woman]
Here come the Grunts!

04:27.528 --> 04:29.007
I'll teach you a lesson.

[creatures grunt]

05:39.426 --> 05:42.994
[creature purrs]

05:43.038 --> 05:44.605
Mm.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.884
[Mercy, in alien language]

07:07.775 --> 07:10.517
[opening theme music plays]

08:10.794 --> 08:12.274
This is amazing.

08:15.277 --> 08:18.410
Finally, something
with potential value.

08:18.454 --> 08:21.936
Results confirm it's over
100,000 years old.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.720
That's pre-human.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.201
Possibly even pre-Covenant.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.030
It's organic,

08:29.073 --> 08:31.772
but with what appears to be
an inherent technology.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.469
According to Master Chief,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.254
it is something to do
with a weapon somewhere.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.821
We have no confirmation,
but Doctor--

08:37.865 --> 08:39.736
And why am I only
hearing about this now?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.172
-You know exactly why.
-I don't understand--

08:41.216 --> 08:42.826
And if it was up to her,

08:42.870 --> 08:44.698
you still wouldn't know
anything about it.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.048
Then why show it to me
in the first place?

08:48.397 --> 08:50.007
I want you to lead a team

08:50.051 --> 08:52.357
in analyzing this artifact.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.664
Determine what it is,
what it does,

08:54.708 --> 08:58.276
and if, in fact, it's part
of some kind of weapon.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.671
Or anything that can give us
an edge against the Covenant.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.500
Separate teams.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.808
Parallel teams.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.681
Dr. Halsey won't like that.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.206
I'm interested
in finding a way

09:15.250 --> 09:18.688
to be less reliant on Dr. Halsey
moving forward.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.821
Can you help me
with that?

09:33.311 --> 09:34.748
-Thank you, Adun.
-Mm-hmm.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.805
How are you feeling?

09:53.201 --> 09:56.421
I'm assuming you cloned me
to obtain organs,

09:56.465 --> 09:57.988
or at least
that was the intent

09:58.032 --> 10:00.687
when I collected samples
of my various tissues.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.906
I collected the samples.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.996
You are merely a product
of the samples.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.824
Yes, a product.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.870
Well, it turns out
not to feel that way

10:09.913 --> 10:11.219
when you're sitting
in this chair.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.701
I have some questions.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.576
Go ahead.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.056
[chair rolls]

10:22.099 --> 10:23.623
What became
of the children?

10:25.712 --> 10:29.237
Uh, well, 35 survived
the original augmentation.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.195
So, more than half died.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.633
That's a far greater percentage
than I imagined.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.460
The rest became Spartans.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.941
And now here I am,
conscious and conversing

10:37.985 --> 10:40.988
with the Sorvad solids
laid out before me.

10:41.031 --> 10:45.035
So, the organ you're after
is my brain.

10:45.079 --> 10:48.299
Or should I say,
your brain?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.781
I've perfected the process

10:51.825 --> 10:54.523
for real-time
neuroelectrical imaging.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.352
The Cortana system's viable?

10:57.395 --> 10:59.093
Mm.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.748
So you'll integrate her
into a working Spartan?

11:02.923 --> 11:04.141
That's next.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.622
I bet it's John.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.363
He was the special one.

11:11.758 --> 11:15.587
Yes, he got himself
into some trouble recently.

11:15.631 --> 11:18.242
This is our only way
of getting him out of it.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.114
[loud clang, buzzing sound]

11:20.157 --> 11:21.855
[clone]
He was always willful.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.598
And none of this
bothers you.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.861
Should it?

11:30.994 --> 11:32.256
What about Miranda?

11:32.300 --> 11:33.605
Our daughter.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.481
I think that we have
everything we need.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.744
Do you remember
when you were my age

11:41.788 --> 11:44.616
and you weren't sure
whether flash-cloning

11:44.660 --> 11:46.706
would ever be made legal?

11:46.749 --> 11:49.143
And you wondered,
if you found yourself

11:49.186 --> 11:53.190
sitting opposite a living,
breathing version of you,

11:53.234 --> 11:56.628
would you actually be able
to go through with it?

11:56.672 --> 11:58.282
What happened?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.373
Progress.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.344
[door clangs open]

12:18.215 --> 12:19.826
This isn't necessary.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.134
It's the only way to return you
to combat duty.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.875
I'm a Spartan.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.747
They can't afford to keep me
off the battlefield.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.749
That's exactly
what I argued

12:29.792 --> 12:32.316
to get us
to where we are now.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.666
I don't need a babysitter.

12:34.710 --> 12:35.885
It's not a babysitter.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.974
This is an upgrade

12:38.018 --> 12:41.586
which will allow us
to analyze the artifact months,

12:41.630 --> 12:44.285
years faster
than by traditional means.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.374
And, most importantly,

12:46.417 --> 12:48.115
it will get you back
on the front lines

12:48.158 --> 12:49.899
where you belong,

12:49.943 --> 12:52.162
where you are so
desperately needed.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.995
Let's get started.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.317
[computer beeping]

13:20.147 --> 13:21.801
[sharp gasp]

13:31.288 --> 13:33.160
I'm afraid
we'll need you awake.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.728
But this will keep
your body still.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.208
Will it hurt?

13:38.252 --> 13:39.296
Oh, yes.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.956
You have the most
beautiful brain.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.916
Soon, you will be part
of something bigger.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.008
And better.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.799
[door hisses open]

14:09.849 --> 14:11.111
-[Halsey] Ready?
-[Adun] Mm-hm.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.073
Cortana?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.610
When the game is over,

17:26.654 --> 17:28.873
the king and the pawn
go back into the same box.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.925
Hello, Dr. Halsey.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.321
It is so good
to finally meet you.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.151
That must be the Master Chief.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.630
Yes.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.328
His military record
is outstanding.

17:48.371 --> 17:51.722
Above the rest in strength,
stamina,

17:51.766 --> 17:53.463
and good instincts.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.249
A natural leader.
I see why you chose him.

17:56.292 --> 17:59.600
Cortana,
in the B-19 sub-stack

17:59.643 --> 18:01.341
of the lab's central repository,

18:01.384 --> 18:03.995
you'll find information
regarding an artifact

18:04.039 --> 18:05.432
that was found
on the planet Madrigal.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.782
I have it.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.914
I'm planning some experiments
to find out more

18:09.958 --> 18:12.526
about its provenance
and functionality,

18:12.569 --> 18:15.833
and I need you to process
that data in real time--

18:15.877 --> 18:17.618
[Cortana]
Doctor, there's a problem.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.099
My neural implant
is operating perfectly,

18:20.142 --> 18:22.579
but I'm unable to take
full operational control

18:22.623 --> 18:23.928
of the subject.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.321
Yes.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.671
For the moment,
I have limited your access

18:27.715 --> 18:29.195
to the reticular formation.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.022
More of an on/off switch.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.547
My directive is to integrate
fully with the Master Chief,

18:33.590 --> 18:35.723
to optimize both his physical
and his mental performance.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.595
And in time you will do that,
and much more.

18:38.639 --> 18:39.770
But...

18:41.903 --> 18:44.732
why have you prevented me
from achieving my directive?

18:44.775 --> 18:46.908
Because John
is a central part

18:46.951 --> 18:48.866
of the examination
of the artifact.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.391
Before I hand him over, I need
to understand how it affects him

18:51.434 --> 18:53.567
and how it might adversely
affect you.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.003
Doctor,
surely I can withstand--

18:55.046 --> 18:56.700
He will be conscious
within the hour.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.876
Can I recommend
that you use this time

18:58.920 --> 19:01.923
to familiarize yourself with
the trove of human knowledge

19:01.966 --> 19:03.490
that's now available to you?

19:05.056 --> 19:07.798
What will I do with
the other 52.4 minutes?

19:07.842 --> 19:09.148
[laughs]

19:09.191 --> 19:10.888
That's very impressive.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.586
Uh...

19:12.629 --> 19:14.414
Don't worry.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.720
I'm gonna keep you very busy.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.782
[electricity crackling]

19:34.825 --> 19:37.698
[indistinct chatter]

19:45.706 --> 19:47.969
[indistinct chatter]

19:52.843 --> 19:55.019
[music playing]

19:57.718 --> 19:59.894
[news anchor 1] ...first images
are coming in from Tantalus,

19:59.937 --> 20:02.201
which was completely wiped out
by Covenant forces...

20:04.812 --> 20:07.118
[chatter and laughter]

20:09.686 --> 20:11.166
-Hey!
-Hey.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.429
[man]
Where you goin'?

20:13.473 --> 20:16.476
[news anchor 2]
...futures sent markets rising,

20:16.519 --> 20:19.043
as prices
of heavy hydrogen surged

20:19.087 --> 20:22.786
after the attack on Madrigal
caused a disruption in output.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.614
Sources close
to Governor Vinsher report

20:24.658 --> 20:26.834
that production will be back up
sooner than expected.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.140
Vinsher's peace treaty
with the UNSC

20:29.184 --> 20:31.360
means one of the insurrection's
last holdouts

20:31.404 --> 20:34.145
has ended its quest
for independence.

20:34.189 --> 20:38.019
As they say, we're all
in this together now.

20:38.062 --> 20:41.152
[clucking]

20:41.196 --> 20:43.154
What do we got here?

20:43.198 --> 20:44.852
A gift from a cargo ship
from Earth.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.159
How many of these we got?

20:48.203 --> 20:49.639
Forty-two cases.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.424
-[man] Come. Come on.
-[man 2] Fourteen?

20:53.861 --> 20:55.166
Take a case.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.690
On me.

20:56.733 --> 20:57.995
[in foreign language]

21:03.697 --> 21:05.307
[Kwan]
I want to go back to Madrigal.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.004
What?

21:07.048 --> 21:09.485
-No.
-Vinsher's taking over.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.574
I have to join
the resistance.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.402
Little girl like you?

21:13.446 --> 21:15.883
I'm not a little girl.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.320
My family have been
on Madrigal

21:18.364 --> 21:19.974
since before
it was even a colony.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.671
I promised John
I'd keep you safe.

21:21.715 --> 21:24.370
I don't see any reason
to break that promise... yet.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.720
There are people still loyal to
my father in the capital city,

21:26.763 --> 21:28.025
I know it.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.244
Let them fight.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.680
It's none of my business.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.116
I'm not asking you
to fight.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.901
I just need a ride
and protection

21:33.944 --> 21:36.120
until I find my people.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.601
I am not interested
in playing bodyguard

21:38.645 --> 21:40.299
to the princess of Madrigal.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.083
Then give me a ship.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.216
Right.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.610
Don't turn your back on me,
asshole!

21:56.271 --> 21:57.925
You're emotional.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.970
And, as a courtesy to John,

22:00.014 --> 22:02.190
I'm not gonna
crush your skull.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.977
Now, run on home
and I'll see you at dinner.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.332
We're having chicken!

22:19.642 --> 22:21.340
So it's always on?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.385
She's always available
to you, yes.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.389
Would you like
to meet her?

22:27.433 --> 22:29.522
Not particularly, no.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.132
Come on.

22:33.308 --> 22:34.353
Cortana.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.097
Hello, Master Chief.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.360
I'm Cortana.

22:44.667 --> 22:45.929
Looks like you.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.453
[Cortana]
Kind of you to say.

22:47.496 --> 22:48.932
I'm designed
to look familiar,

22:48.976 --> 22:50.760
my voice and accent
to be pleasant.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.588
I'm your built-in navigator,
battle strategis--

22:52.632 --> 22:54.285
How does it work?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.287
The system contains
a hollow particle exciter,

22:56.331 --> 22:59.334
which means she can appear
to you in any environment.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.596
So it answers
to my command?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.293
I see it as more
of a partnership.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.078
And when I'm not deployed,
where does it go?

23:04.121 --> 23:06.167
Doctor, he must not be aware
what I'm capable of.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.430
On and off the field of battle,
I can--

23:08.474 --> 23:09.997
Thank you, Cortana.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.172
Oh.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.219
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Master Chief.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.657
I'll speak to you soon...

23:18.832 --> 23:20.355
I guess.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.360
I don't like this.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.449
Trust me, you will.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.016
She's going to enhance
your abilities

23:29.059 --> 23:30.844
in the field
one hundredfold.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.151
You are the best
we've got.

23:34.195 --> 23:36.545
She's going to make you
even better.

23:38.242 --> 23:41.376
This is a great leap forward,
for all of us.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.825
[man] Acknowledged
and received.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.566
[overlapping chatter]

23:57.610 --> 23:59.699
[man 2] Yes, sir,
that is the drill status.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.527
[alarm sounding]

24:03.746 --> 24:05.618
Commander,
a slipspace anomaly

24:05.661 --> 24:07.358
just appeared
on our starboard quarter.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.495
[Yates]
Covenant corvette.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.149
[man] They appear
dead in the water.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.803
No fluctuations
from repulsor engines,

24:16.846 --> 24:18.369
no sign of field atomics.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.415
Minimal organic
heat signatures.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.764
And their weapons are cold.

24:24.593 --> 24:27.466
Open the artillery bay.
Bring us around 90 degrees.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.597
-Yes, sir.
-Prepare to fire.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.387
[man]
Forward gun is hot, sir.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.607
[woman]
Communication incoming, sir.

24:38.651 --> 24:40.217
They're hailing us?

24:40.261 --> 24:43.046
Civilian emergency channel, sir.
One-six.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.222
Put it on the horn.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.094
Yes, sir.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.400
[Makee] I don't know how
much longer I can survive here.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.315
Hello? Can you hear me?

24:51.359 --> 24:53.230
Anyone out there?

24:53.274 --> 24:55.406
This is UNSC ship Gladius.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.930
Identify yourself.

24:56.973 --> 24:59.106
[cries out]
Oh, no! I need help!

24:59.149 --> 25:01.412
I'm from planet Circumstance.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.892
We were taken prisoner.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.720
My family's dead.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.896
I only have my father's radio,
and it's dying.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.029
How many onboard?

25:09.072 --> 25:10.552
I'm alone here.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.250
The aliens abandoned in pods

25:13.294 --> 25:15.426
when the engines failed.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.732
Please help me.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.908
-Prepare a drone pod.
-Yes, sir.

25:18.952 --> 25:22.303
Ma'am, we're sending you a pod.
Board it when it reaches you.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.826
Do not bring any weapons
with you.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.175
Is that understood?

25:25.219 --> 25:27.526
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.571
[sobbing]
Please come quick.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.703
Thank you.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.010
[creatures growl]

26:06.260 --> 26:07.522
I'm ready.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.612
Cortana?

26:10.656 --> 26:12.353
[Cortana]
I'm also ready, Dr. Halsey.

26:17.010 --> 26:18.620
Okay, John.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.107
[energy humming]

26:37.508 --> 26:40.424
[electricity crackles]

26:40.468 --> 26:41.556
[exaggerated panting]

26:41.600 --> 26:42.470
Where were you playing today?

26:44.211 --> 26:45.604
[barks]

26:59.139 --> 27:01.184
Go ahead, Cortana.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.446
[Cortana]
Putting him into stasis

27:02.490 --> 27:03.491
to access the artifact.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.931
[gasps]

27:08.975 --> 27:11.934
I'm now getting no readings
from the artifact at all.

27:13.588 --> 27:14.807
That's fascinating.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.420
Cortana, release him.

27:23.032 --> 27:25.469
[panting]

27:29.212 --> 27:30.866
That was different.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.526
Okay, John, we're going to let
your vitals return to normal.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.659
Just give us a moment
to go through the data.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.881
[Cortana]
Dr. Halsey, if you gave me

27:45.925 --> 27:47.709
full control
of the subject now,

27:47.753 --> 27:49.058
my readings
will be more accurate.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.625
It's unclear
why the artifact

27:50.669 --> 27:53.062
responds only to John as John,
but it does.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.064
I was not designed
to be an assistant.

27:55.108 --> 27:58.241
You were designed
to follow my orders.

27:58.285 --> 28:01.592
I'm not going to risk
our ability to interact with it.

28:01.636 --> 28:02.768
[pounding glass]

28:02.811 --> 28:03.943
Are we done?

28:24.746 --> 28:28.097
[indistinct PA announcement]

28:31.840 --> 28:33.581
[voice]
Docking complete.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.375
Step out.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.601
Get on the ground.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.432
Search.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.045
[gasps softly]

29:06.788 --> 29:07.702
Clean.

29:09.356 --> 29:10.531
Did they hurt you?

29:12.620 --> 29:13.752
No, I...

29:14.883 --> 29:16.493
I'm okay.

29:16.537 --> 29:17.756
Stand, please.

29:23.631 --> 29:24.719
Welcome.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.898
Thank you.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.336
[all scream and shout]

29:33.380 --> 29:35.382
[Yates]
Christ! It's those crabs!

29:36.862 --> 29:38.820
-Seal the doors!
-[man] No!

29:38.864 --> 29:41.823
[Yates] They're in the walls!
Goddamn it!

29:41.867 --> 29:43.520

29:55.097 --> 29:56.229
Fall back!

29:56.272 --> 29:57.708
[indistinct shout]

29:57.752 --> 29:58.666
[woman]
Go, go! Get back!

30:01.451 --> 30:03.192
[screams]

30:03.236 --> 30:04.890
[indistinct PA announcement]

30:04.933 --> 30:06.674
[voice]
Come in. Please respond.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.200
[audible slithering]

30:11.244 --> 30:13.594

Commencing core protocol.

[screams and groans]

30:18.425 --> 30:19.600
[groans]

30:24.431 --> 30:27.303
Where did the Demon
take my keystone?

30:27.347 --> 30:29.566
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.572
[gasps]

30:35.616 --> 30:37.009
Where is your home base?

30:38.184 --> 30:40.882
I will tell you nothing,

30:40.926 --> 30:43.885
and you won't find anything
on our ship to lead you there.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.278
[choking]

30:45.321 --> 30:46.409
Humans.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.457
Just as ugly as I remember.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.113

31:17.832 --> 31:19.965
[woman] Left, right, left.
Hustle!

31:21.488 --> 31:24.056
[woman] Come on, now!
You know it!

31:24.099 --> 31:26.014
[happy chatter]

31:28.930 --> 31:30.192
[indistinct shouting]

31:30.236 --> 31:31.411
[cheering]

31:31.454 --> 31:32.542
Yeah!

31:34.196 --> 31:36.764
-[woman] Hey, Master Chief.
-[man] Hey, Master Chief.

31:36.807 --> 31:38.157
[man 2] Come on.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.637
[woman 2]
Hey, look, look, look.

31:40.681 --> 31:41.943
[man 3]
Let's go!

31:41.987 --> 31:43.945
[man 4]
He's back.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.165
[overlapping chatter]

31:48.907 --> 31:50.604
[computer whirring]

31:52.823 --> 31:54.695
Apple, key, longsword,
justice-Mandarin, banshee,

31:54.738 --> 31:58.525
flower, character-Russian, pig,
house, honor-Arabic, Goa, Earth.

31:58.568 --> 32:01.006
[heavy door opens, closes]

32:06.272 --> 32:08.013
[Kai] Ongoing, ziggurat, Meg,

32:08.056 --> 32:09.492
scarab, noun, scene,

32:09.536 --> 32:11.842
M-60 automatic,
infant, anterior.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.279
Form up.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.376
I've been cleared
to return to duty.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.031
If anyone has anything

32:26.074 --> 32:28.816
they'd like to ask
or tell me, please--

32:28.859 --> 32:30.774
We've been briefed, Chief.

32:30.818 --> 32:33.777
We've been fighting together
since we were kids, Chief.

32:33.821 --> 32:36.519
Whatever you do,
we trust you.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.698
Very well.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.224
As you were.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.574
Hello, can I have your attention
for a moment, please?

32:47.617 --> 32:49.619
-What are you doing?
-To those of you

32:49.663 --> 32:52.318
who haven't heard of me,
I'm Cortana.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.146
I'll be working
with Master Chief to provide

32:54.189 --> 32:56.626
logistical and tactical support
for Silver team.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.802
-No, I didn't summon you.
-Summon me?

32:58.846 --> 33:01.936
This is coming
from inside you, Chief?

33:01.980 --> 33:02.937
Go away.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.722
A.I. off.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.550
I'm introducing myself
to the rest of the team.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.335
Go. Disappear!

33:11.990 --> 33:14.514
I look forward
to working with you all.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.868
New A.I. Halsey's.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.786
It's temporary.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.930
That's Hessiod.

33:39.974 --> 33:42.368
It's a big ball of gas.

33:42.411 --> 33:44.544
And that one there
is Metisette,

33:44.587 --> 33:46.285
but no one goes there.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.591
I don't think
there's any air.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.724
How about Madrigal?
Can you see it?

33:52.291 --> 33:54.641
It's right... there.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.251
I don't see it.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.079
Doesn't mean
it's not there, silly.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.473
Kessler, time
to wash up, honey.

34:00.516 --> 34:02.257
You really
don't see it?

34:02.301 --> 34:03.824
[Laera]
Kess.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.217
I'll show you later.

34:06.348 --> 34:07.915
Bye.

34:12.311 --> 34:15.531
It's funny, I never look out
that window.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.187
[Kwan]
Why not?

34:21.015 --> 34:22.495
[Laera]
When you stare into deep space,

34:22.538 --> 34:24.540
you're seeing things
as they once were.

34:25.846 --> 34:27.674
I choose to live
in the present.

34:29.328 --> 34:31.373
-I can't stay here.
-[Kessler] Mama, come!

34:32.853 --> 34:34.855
And if you go, and you die?

34:37.075 --> 34:40.469
The creatures who destroyed my
planet took everything from me.

34:40.513 --> 34:43.168
Everything but my spirit.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.648
Every day that I live
in that spirit

34:45.692 --> 34:47.259
is a victory over them.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.565
-Someday, you will--
-I'm not you.

34:49.609 --> 34:52.742
I can't just stay here
and eat and drink and smoke

34:52.786 --> 34:55.571
and pretend nothing else exists
outside that window.

34:59.923 --> 35:04.189
I'm sorry you lost your planet,
but Madrigal still has a chance.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.410
If I don't try,
I couldn't live with myself.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.587
I'm going to fight.

35:13.241 --> 35:16.244
The universe will be diminished
without you in it.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.993
[footsteps]

35:28.082 --> 35:29.562
[computer beeping]

35:31.216 --> 35:32.869
[Cortana]
Whatever you're searching for,

35:32.913 --> 35:34.044
I can locate it.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.484
Where are you?

35:38.527 --> 35:40.921
I'm directly connected
to your auditory cortex.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.488
Was I not clear with you?

35:42.531 --> 35:44.403
Told you to leave me alone.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.753
Yes, you've gotten quite good
at dismissing me,

35:46.796 --> 35:49.451
but you're not as good
at targeting your search query.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.887
[buzz]

35:53.760 --> 35:56.154
[sighs]

35:56.197 --> 35:57.938
If I understand your objective,

35:57.981 --> 35:59.679
I can be helpful.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.594
I'm actually quite good
at this.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.426
I'm listening.

36:07.469 --> 36:08.775
[scoffs]

36:12.344 --> 36:16.565
When I touch the artifact,
I see things.

36:16.609 --> 36:17.958
What kind of things?

36:20.352 --> 36:22.267
They feel like...

36:22.310 --> 36:24.094
memories, I guess.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.575
It doesn't help me
to hear what you feel.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.577
What do you see, exactly?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.057
A picnic.

36:31.667 --> 36:32.842
A forest.

36:35.149 --> 36:38.413
A dog. My dog, I think.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.154
Still not helpful.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.764
But based on the keywords
in your query,

36:41.808 --> 36:44.245
I find 103 human colonies
or moons

36:44.289 --> 36:46.856
containing the specific flora
and fauna you are seeking.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.510
Would you like to see the list?

36:48.554 --> 36:50.208
Yes.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.121
Please.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.388
I've been to some
of these planets.

36:56.431 --> 36:59.391
There were Spartan deployments
to 23 of these planets.

37:01.654 --> 37:02.785
Mamore.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.353
Mamore.

37:07.834 --> 37:10.184
We lost Nora 0-9-8
on Mamore.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.796
Is the artifact bringing up
memories of Nora 0-9-8?

37:13.840 --> 37:14.841
No.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.106
I remember losing her,
I just...

37:20.325 --> 37:21.543
What?

37:21.587 --> 37:23.284
I don't feel anything.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.851
That's as it should be.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.461
The hormonal pellet
in your spine

37:26.505 --> 37:27.854
suppresses adverse
emotional responses

37:27.897 --> 37:29.551
and protects mission readiness.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.814
It's part of what
makes you a Spartan.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.729
I know, but when I touch
the artifact...

37:36.036 --> 37:38.168
I don't just see those memories.

37:41.694 --> 37:42.825
I feel them.

37:47.743 --> 37:50.006
[Cortana]
Dr. Halsey, we have an issue.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.708
Master Chief,
what are you doing?

37:57.797 --> 38:00.190
Chief is trying to remove
his emotional regulator.

38:00.234 --> 38:01.801
-Why?
-I believe it has to do

38:01.844 --> 38:04.020
with the visions
he's been experiencing.

38:05.413 --> 38:07.328
-I can put him in stasis.
-No, no.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.591
I want you to help him.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.854
Removing his pellet is a direct
violation of Section Three,

38:11.898 --> 38:13.073
Regulations
on Spartan Behavior.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.727
I'll take care of the pellet.

38:14.770 --> 38:17.338
It's better that he sees you
as an accomplice

38:17.382 --> 38:19.253
rather than a spy.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.082
[Cortana sighs] This is not
what I signed up for.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.087
It'll be easier
if you let me help.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.225
Down.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.314
Down...

38:37.576 --> 38:39.795
left... there.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.755
Now make a 1.3-centimeter
vertical incision.

38:44.278 --> 38:45.366
Trust me.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.066
Good.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.547
You should feel something solid
at the tip of the blade.

38:54.114 --> 38:56.856
Twist 45 degrees
and use the knife edge to...

38:56.899 --> 38:58.466
[John grunts]

39:09.303 --> 39:11.000
Thank you.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.394
Like I've been trying
to tell you, Master Chief,

39:13.438 --> 39:15.135
I'm here for you.

39:47.776 --> 39:50.126
[distant cheer goes up]

39:57.307 --> 40:01.007
[laughter and chatter]

40:11.234 --> 40:14.107
[lively chatter]

40:19.504 --> 40:21.419
[chatter continues]

40:28.034 --> 40:30.210
[man] You're okay.
You're okay.

40:30.253 --> 40:31.907
[chatter continues]

40:31.951 --> 40:33.953
[jet engines overhead]

40:50.099 --> 40:52.058
[woman on PA]
Welcome to Reach Transit.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.886
Please advance
to the platform for boarding.

40:53.929 --> 40:56.976
[woman] Cool beans! Oh,
it's my ball? Oh, my ball!

40:57.019 --> 40:59.544
Chief, based on the readings
from your limbic system,

40:59.587 --> 41:01.502
this is a new experience
for you.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.112
Let me help you.

41:03.156 --> 41:06.551
This train makes stops
at Reach Naval Academy,

41:06.594 --> 41:09.118
Tchakova Park,
and Manassas.

41:09.162 --> 41:11.294
Do you know
where you'd like to go?

41:17.866 --> 41:20.390
[man on PA]
Next stop, Tchakova Park.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.001
Tchakova Park
is our next stop.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.789
[laughing]

41:35.754 --> 41:37.799
[indistinct chatter]

41:40.759 --> 41:42.804
[woman]
Hola, chica.

41:44.153 --> 41:45.590
[happy chatter]

41:49.550 --> 41:51.857
[chatter continues]

41:55.121 --> 41:57.819
[distant applause]

41:57.863 --> 41:59.952
[wistful classical music
playing]

42:07.307 --> 42:10.658
[classical music continues]

42:25.020 --> 42:27.719
[music continues]

42:33.376 --> 42:35.378
[boy]
Hey. It's mine.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.600
Thanks.

42:39.644 --> 42:41.210
[music continues]

42:46.520 --> 42:49.567
[Cortana] Is this why
you've removed your pellet?

42:49.610 --> 42:51.830
So you could
hear things differently?

42:53.571 --> 42:55.573
Maybe I just wanted to hear it
like everyone else.

42:58.097 --> 42:59.533
[dog whimpers]

43:09.412 --> 43:12.154
[dog whines]

43:29.607 --> 43:31.086
[beeps]

43:31.130 --> 43:32.479
Cortana.

43:33.741 --> 43:35.308
-[beeps]
-Cortana.

43:36.962 --> 43:38.572
-Can you open this?
-Why do you need to--?

43:38.616 --> 43:39.834
Can you open this?

43:39.878 --> 43:41.793
[Halsey]
Open it, Cortana.

43:43.664 --> 43:46.449
[beeping]

43:46.493 --> 43:49.191
[Cortana] Chief,
do not touch the artifact.

43:49.235 --> 43:51.498
Each time you do, it stresses
your heart and nervous system.

44:01.769 --> 44:02.901
[father]
John!

44:04.424 --> 44:05.555
What did we talk about?

44:06.861 --> 44:08.167
[dog barks]

44:08.210 --> 44:09.255
I asked you what you're drawing.

44:13.781 --> 44:16.697
Let's have this be the end
of all this nonsense, John.

44:16.741 --> 44:19.352
Mom! I don't want to do it!

44:20.570 --> 44:22.355
[gasping]

44:22.398 --> 44:24.705
[father]
Bury it, son.

44:24.749 --> 44:26.664
Another one?

44:26.707 --> 44:28.100
See how they go together?

44:31.625 --> 44:33.279
-[gasps]
-[Cortana] Ohh.

44:34.541 --> 44:36.499
[John panting]

44:38.937 --> 44:40.721
There's a second artifact.

44:40.765 --> 44:43.419
-Are you sure?
-I drew it.

44:43.463 --> 44:45.073
Over and over.

44:45.117 --> 44:47.075
My mother was there.

44:47.119 --> 44:49.077
My father buried...

44:49.121 --> 44:50.296
I saw...

44:50.339 --> 44:51.993
I must have seen...

44:53.560 --> 44:55.257
What if the second artifact
is what we buried?

44:55.301 --> 44:56.824
[Cortana]
Chief, your blood pressure

44:56.868 --> 44:58.478
is dangerously elevated.

44:58.521 --> 44:59.958
We need to return
to barracks right--

45:00.001 --> 45:01.611
Ice rings.

45:01.655 --> 45:04.049
The planet that I lived on
had rings of ice around it.

45:04.092 --> 45:05.790
How many planets
have rings on your list?

45:05.833 --> 45:07.530
Seen from the planet's surface?

45:07.574 --> 45:08.749
Yes.

45:08.793 --> 45:10.359
Only three.

45:11.883 --> 45:13.319
Show me.

45:16.670 --> 45:18.367
[birds tweeting]

45:21.631 --> 45:23.982
[John]
This is the place.

45:24.025 --> 45:25.679
I'm sure of it.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.202
[Cortana]
Eridanus Two.

45:27.246 --> 45:28.769
But how could I have
been here?

45:28.813 --> 45:30.510
Eridanus is uninhabited.

45:30.553 --> 45:32.468
It wasn't always.

45:32.512 --> 45:35.341
The planet was a select site
for the Reach for Life project.

45:35.384 --> 45:38.387
Reach for Life is an ambitious
feat of human ingenuity.

45:38.431 --> 45:41.869
Teams of UNSC biologists,
botanists, and geophysicists

45:41.913 --> 45:44.002
designed and built
the installation

45:44.045 --> 45:46.482
as a self-sustaining ecosystem.

45:46.526 --> 45:50.225
The goal: To seed life
on otherwise barren planets

45:50.269 --> 45:53.141
and hence to extend the reach
of humankind in the galaxy.

45:53.185 --> 45:54.969
I'm from here.

45:55.013 --> 45:56.449
That's according
to the promotional material.

45:57.842 --> 46:00.018
So this is where I lived.

46:00.061 --> 46:02.977
Based on your memories,
it's highly likely.

46:03.021 --> 46:05.893
What do you mean,
"based on my memories"?

46:05.937 --> 46:07.895
Can't you just
check the records?

46:07.939 --> 46:09.418
The operational files were lost

46:09.462 --> 46:11.246
when the program
was abruptly terminated.

46:11.290 --> 46:13.161
Why? What happened?

46:13.205 --> 46:16.512
A plague carried in on
an unauthorized transport ship.

46:16.556 --> 46:19.341
It spread quickly, killing off
most of the population.

46:19.385 --> 46:21.213
There was no cure.

46:21.256 --> 46:23.128
What about my parents?

46:23.171 --> 46:24.912
Survivors were evacuated
to Ehilend,

46:24.956 --> 46:26.261
where you were adopted
at age 6--

46:26.305 --> 46:27.436
Cortana!

46:28.829 --> 46:31.658
What happened
to my parents?

46:31.701 --> 46:34.443
In accordance with Emergency
Contact Protocol Upsilon,

46:34.487 --> 46:36.794
the planet was sealed off
to contain the virus.

46:39.405 --> 46:40.623
I have no other data.

46:46.107 --> 46:48.457
Oh. I'm sorry, Chief, I...

46:48.501 --> 46:50.459
[Halsey]
John, what's going on?

46:50.503 --> 46:51.721
Dr. Halsey.

46:51.765 --> 46:52.940
Why are you armored up?

46:52.984 --> 46:54.376
When I removed
my pellet,

46:54.420 --> 46:55.943
I realized that
an altered hormonal state

46:55.987 --> 46:57.771
might affect my interactions
with the artifact.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.121
-Removed your pellet?
-There are two artifacts.

47:00.165 --> 47:01.862
The one that I found
on Madrigal,

47:01.906 --> 47:04.952
and another one that
goes with it somehow, and...

47:04.996 --> 47:08.738
I saw it as a child
on Eridanus Two.

47:08.782 --> 47:10.436
Are you sure?

47:14.527 --> 47:17.051
The images that I've been
seeing...

47:20.141 --> 47:21.926
they're memories.

47:21.969 --> 47:24.015
My memories.

47:24.058 --> 47:25.799
Of my family.

47:29.368 --> 47:31.631
We'll send some probes
to Eridanus Two.

47:31.674 --> 47:33.981
-We'll start a survey, and--
-No.

47:34.025 --> 47:36.331
-I'm going.
-No.

47:36.375 --> 47:38.072
Send a probe.
Stare at all the data you want.

47:38.116 --> 47:39.813
I need to see it for myself.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.293
John...

47:43.730 --> 47:45.732
I'll come with you.

48:01.139 --> 48:03.141
[Kwan]
ECAM panel two.

48:04.577 --> 48:06.535
FMS? Where the hell is it?

48:06.579 --> 48:09.016
-[electricity crackles]
-Ow! Damn it!

48:09.060 --> 48:11.192
Ow.

48:11.236 --> 48:15.718
These old birds, they're not
like the new UNSC ships.

48:15.762 --> 48:17.851
FMS is on the other side.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.507
I'm going to free Madrigal,
and you can't stop me.

48:21.550 --> 48:24.510
I could kill you for trying
to steal my favorite ship.

48:24.553 --> 48:26.207
That would stop you.

48:27.774 --> 48:29.297
Listen, Soren,

48:29.341 --> 48:30.908
if I can just find
my father's generals,

48:30.951 --> 48:32.953
I'll join the fight
against Vinsher.

48:34.172 --> 48:36.087
I... I have money.

48:36.130 --> 48:37.523
[Soren]
You got nothin'.

48:37.566 --> 48:38.959
My family is rich.

48:39.003 --> 48:40.918
-How rich?
-Deuterium rich.

48:43.181 --> 48:44.486
You think what's left
of your old man's army's

48:44.530 --> 48:46.662
got what it takes
to take on Vinsher?

48:46.706 --> 48:48.360
Not your problem.

48:48.403 --> 48:50.579
All you have to do is get me
to them and you get paid.

48:50.623 --> 48:52.407
Just like that?

48:52.451 --> 48:53.800
Just like that.

48:58.892 --> 49:00.850
Deuterium money, huh?

49:00.894 --> 49:02.504
I swear, you won't regret it.

49:02.548 --> 49:03.853
Oh, I know
I won't regret it.

49:03.897 --> 49:06.030
I'm gonna get paid
either way.

49:06.073 --> 49:08.075
If not from you,

49:08.119 --> 49:09.990
then from the bounty
on your head.

49:10.034 --> 49:11.339
You get me?

49:22.655 --> 49:24.396
[electronic whining
and beeping]

49:26.833 --> 49:28.313
[systems power up]

49:39.977 --> 49:41.630
[Makee, in alien language]

49:41.674 --> 49:43.284
[response in alien language]

49:44.503 --> 49:46.592
[Makee]

49:57.646 --> 50:00.475
[recorded conversation
distorted]

50:07.656 --> 50:09.397
That's Sangheili.

50:09.441 --> 50:11.225
Fragments of the Gladius's
last transmission.

50:11.269 --> 50:14.141
Electromagnetic scatter
corrupted the signal.

50:14.185 --> 50:16.491
A.I.'s been able to partially
reconstruct it,

50:16.535 --> 50:18.232
so no idea
who's doing the talking.

50:18.276 --> 50:20.713
It's probably an Elite.
They run the show.

50:20.756 --> 50:22.584
Grunts are chatty,
but not over comms.

50:22.628 --> 50:24.238
So, what are they saying?

50:24.282 --> 50:25.587
I'll work on it...

50:25.631 --> 50:27.154
soon as I recover
from my system crash.

50:28.634 --> 50:30.679
-Power surge?
-No, it was after that,

50:30.723 --> 50:34.205
right about the time Parangosky
created parallel teams.

50:35.902 --> 50:37.556
Dr. Halsey's headed off
on a mission,

50:37.599 --> 50:41.342
away from Fleetcom
and away from the artifact.

50:41.386 --> 50:43.475
Keep your critical data
behind a firewall

50:43.518 --> 50:46.260
and use your time wisely.

50:46.304 --> 50:47.827
[distorted voice]
Got it.

50:53.006 --> 50:55.052
[Halsey]
So, this is it.

50:55.095 --> 50:57.663
It's what Cortana
was able to generate

50:57.706 --> 50:59.447
based on John's description.

50:59.491 --> 51:01.841
You saw what the smaller one
was capable of.

51:01.884 --> 51:05.279
Can you imagine
the combined potential?

51:05.323 --> 51:07.977
You really think we'll find
the other piece on Eridanus?

51:08.021 --> 51:09.849
Or is John
just imagining it?

51:13.679 --> 51:15.594
[Halsey]
It's impossible to say.

51:18.336 --> 51:21.295
The mind is certainly capable
of invention.

51:27.432 --> 51:30.130
Particularly when we're lost
in the dark...

51:32.437 --> 51:33.525
and desperate.

51:43.883 --> 51:45.928
But if we want to separate

51:45.972 --> 51:49.236
what's real
from what's imagined...

51:51.543 --> 51:52.892
we really have no choice.

51:55.416 --> 51:58.158
We have to see
for ourselves.

51:58.202 --> 52:00.378
And if returning to Eridanus

52:00.421 --> 52:03.207
brings back other memories
for John...

52:03.250 --> 52:06.601
the truth could
bring us all down.

52:10.301 --> 52:13.391
[Halsey]
That is what Cortana is for.

52:13.434 --> 52:16.437
[music rises]

52:28.145 --> 52:31.931
[end theme music plays]
