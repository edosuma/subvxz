10:04.125 --> 10:06.431
-Let us in.
-Get in line. Oh...

10:06.475 --> 10:07.955
Oh, Mistress of the Winter
Constellations!

10:07.998 --> 10:10.261
Oh, I didn't realize!
Please don't flay me.

10:10.305 --> 10:13.090
Oh, h-he's just kidding.
I would never flay.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.266
I owe you an eternal debt
of gratitude.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.181
My grandchildren
will sing of this day.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.357
-[dance music thumping]
-Tendi.

10:19.401 --> 10:22.491
Shame on you for not
bringing me here before now.

10:22.534 --> 10:25.276
-♪
-[indistinct chatter]

10:25.320 --> 10:27.714
Are we gonna talk about how
everyone's in awe of Tendi?

10:27.757 --> 10:30.064
She does command
an unexpected gravitas

10:30.107 --> 10:31.631
for someone so excitable.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.679
It's on the house, Mistress.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.073
And that is from the Madame.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.596
-[grunts]
-Mariner!

10:40.640 --> 10:42.424
[grunting, groaning]
All good.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.035
Ah, I love it, actually.
All part of the ambience.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.428
[chuckling]

10:46.471 --> 10:48.560
Here for payback, D'Vana?

10:48.604 --> 10:50.432
I don't know what you're
talking about, Madame G.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.608
-I'm just here looking
for my sister.
-Ugh.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.655
Bridal kidnappings are so gaudy.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.308
I thought the Tendis had class.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.571
I don't care what you think,
just what you know.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.051
I've heard some whispers,

11:01.095 --> 11:02.836
but you'll have to earn them.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.013
Oh, please, can we not?

11:09.451 --> 11:11.105
[sighs]

11:14.195 --> 11:15.892
[hissing, snarling]

11:22.246 --> 11:25.641
Oh, has Starfleet softened you?

11:27.338 --> 11:30.254
Ah. Yes. I love being soft.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.692
Tendi, how are you so good at
the murder-bug drinking game?

11:32.735 --> 11:34.389
I don't know.
It's my first time.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.564
Guess I'm just a natural.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.827
[coughs]

11:37.871 --> 11:40.134
Nya'al is still in love
with D'Erika.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.178
Everyone knows it.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.355
So you're saying he's to blame?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.575
[coughing]

11:49.796 --> 11:52.537
Bridenappings are for show.
But if it was Nya'al,

11:52.581 --> 11:54.104
D'Erika could
really be in trouble.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.019
-Let's get moving.
-Ah, let's get brunch

11:56.063 --> 11:58.195
-while you're in town, girl.
-Oh, for sure.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.849
There is no way I'm calling her.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.205
[Southern accent]:
And you, sir, are as clever

12:08.249 --> 12:10.120
as an alley cat
on his tenth life.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.469
[Southern accent]:
I am but a humble crumb

12:11.513 --> 12:13.689
on the biscuit of your wit, sir.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.256
[guffawing]

12:15.299 --> 12:18.694
I say, I can't believe
two charming devils

12:18.738 --> 12:21.566
such as ourselves
were ever at odds,

12:21.610 --> 12:23.568
my identical friend.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.440
[regular accent]:
Yeah. For some reason,
when we're both Mark Twain,

12:25.483 --> 12:27.224
we seem to be able
to really find common ground

12:27.268 --> 12:29.357
-without any lingering
resentment.
-[clears throat]

12:29.400 --> 12:31.098
[clears throat]
[Southern accent]: I mean, uh,

12:31.141 --> 12:33.840
to paraphrase
the old rail-splitter,

12:33.883 --> 12:37.147
a house divided in Twain
cannot stand.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.583
-[guffawing]
-Okeydokey.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.848
It would be my honor
if you would mist the bonsai

12:41.891 --> 12:45.155
on odd stardates,
my doppleganging devil.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.767
And you, sir,
shall have the evens.

12:49.681 --> 12:50.770
RANSOM [on comms]:
Lieutenants Boimler
and Rutherford

12:50.813 --> 12:51.858
report to the bridge.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.860
I say, we're on the way, sir.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.775
Computer, arch.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.039
[regular accent]:
Why are vests so complicated?

13:00.301 --> 13:02.346
So, uh, Tendi,
would you like to talk

13:02.390 --> 13:04.696
about how you totally
whupped ass back there?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.263
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.744
High school friendships
always age weird, you know?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.485
This next place
will be way more chill.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.401
Fascinating. Orions
attend secondary education.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.838
Yeah. I wasn't going to
get into Starfleet Academy

13:15.882 --> 13:17.231
because I can tie
a lot of knots.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.928
How many knots can you tie?

13:18.972 --> 13:20.495
Mm... [weak chuckle]

13:20.538 --> 13:22.105
Hey, I, eh... who cares?
We've all tied some knots.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.411
Knots are fun.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.805
-♪
-[laughter, indistinct chatter]

13:25.848 --> 13:27.719
MARINER:
Ooh, pretty nice hump dungeon.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.286
I think they have one of these
in New Seattle.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.288
These are
pretty common on Orion.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.812
The males appear
to be under some sort

13:32.855 --> 13:34.204
of chemical manipulation,

13:34.248 --> 13:36.293
perhaps controlled
by pheromones.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.165
-Don't log that.
-Yeah, Tendi's made it clear

13:38.208 --> 13:39.862
that Starfleet
made those pheromones up.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.298
I mean, they had to explain
why a captain

13:41.342 --> 13:43.257
would get taken out
by some Orion showgirls.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.693
CLUBGOER:
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.956
Blast me with more 'mones.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.306
-[inhaling]
-Huh.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.308
Uh, technically,
I said that not all Orions

13:51.352 --> 13:53.484
control men with pheromones.
Some of us definitely do,

13:53.528 --> 13:54.877
-just not me.
-[male whoops]

13:56.836 --> 13:58.663
-Nya'al!
-Oh, [bleep]!

13:59.926 --> 14:01.275
Get back here!

14:01.318 --> 14:02.624
Nya'al's got some speed
for being

14:02.667 --> 14:04.278
a big ol' hunk of ham steak.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.019
He is aesthetically pleasing.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.587
[crying]
Mistress,

14:09.631 --> 14:10.937
I swear I know nothing.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.329
I'm just a 'monehead.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.766
I spend all day and night
hopped up on the stink.

14:14.810 --> 14:18.770
So what's gonna spill first--
your mouth or your guts?

14:18.814 --> 14:20.163
Uh, I heard that
in a holo-movie.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.817
-FEMALE: D'Vana?
-[patrons gasp]

14:21.861 --> 14:25.473
Why are you threatening one
of my most obedient boys?

14:25.516 --> 14:29.303
Relax, have a drink,
get lascivious.

14:29.346 --> 14:32.436
I'm not interested in any
of the sexy nonsense, Ingreeta.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.221
I'm here for D'Erika's ex.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.614
Pity. The D'Vana I know

14:36.658 --> 14:39.356
would never turn down
a cage shower.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.489
[short chuckle] She's kidding.
Tell them you're kidding.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.360
It never mattered that
she didn't have the pheromones.

14:43.404 --> 14:44.665
-She didn't need it.
-[inhaling]

14:44.709 --> 14:48.148
Men would simply
fall at her feet, stricken.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.671
You stricked people?

14:49.714 --> 14:52.239
Are all pheromonal Orions
naturally manipulative

14:52.282 --> 14:53.936
or is it specific to this woman?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.808
How dare you judge me, Vulcan?

14:56.852 --> 14:58.375
[grunts]
[bleep]!

14:58.419 --> 14:59.768
Oh, what are the odds?

14:59.811 --> 15:01.465
Are-Are you seeing this?

15:01.509 --> 15:04.381
You can't come into
my scentuary and insult me.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.949
Prepare to face my thrall.
Kill her.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.777
Tendi, look out for the hunks!

15:08.820 --> 15:09.909
[grunting]

15:12.085 --> 15:14.652
Oh, man,
another pheromone dungeon?

15:14.696 --> 15:17.003
Wh-What did you do to him?

15:17.046 --> 15:18.613
Just a little compound
I mixed up

15:18.656 --> 15:20.571
to counteract the effects
of the pheromone.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.487
Would be a pity if I dispersed
the whole bottle in here.

15:23.531 --> 15:26.229
Don't!
All I have is my stink.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.710
Nya'al, tell her what you know.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.973
I've been a mess
since D'Erika got engaged,

15:31.017 --> 15:33.845
but all I did was
give myself over to the 'mones.

15:33.889 --> 15:37.545
Sometimes I follow her and
watch wistfully from a distance.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.373
Last time, she was
just wandering around

15:39.415 --> 15:40.852
the ship graveyard.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.898
All right, that makes sense.
You're a good guy, Nya'al.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.986
You should go home.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.553
I will.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.989
Stop groveling.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.209
-Lick my foot.
-Yes, ma'am.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.427
[male roaring]

15:50.471 --> 15:52.429
-Dude, your 'stache.
-[yelps]

15:52.473 --> 15:54.040
[roars]

15:54.083 --> 15:56.216
With all due respect, Coqqor,

15:56.259 --> 15:57.869
you have no claim
to this sector.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.263
That nebula is ours to scan.

16:00.307 --> 16:04.267
No. Your vessel will interfere
with our data gathering.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.053
We can power down systems
or share the data...

16:07.096 --> 16:08.924
We don't trust Starfleet data.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.448
-It's too nuanced and thorough.
-I'm sorry,

16:11.492 --> 16:14.016
but analyzing that nebula
is my mission.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.627
Are you willing to die for it?

16:16.671 --> 16:20.022
If we can't resolve this
the nebula will phase shift

16:20.066 --> 16:21.937
and neither of us
will get to scan it.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.026
Then so it shall be!

16:24.070 --> 16:25.549
[scoffs] Close channel.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.856
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
chance

16:27.899 --> 16:29.597
to scan an oscillating nebula.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.687
There has to be something
we can do to find common ground

16:32.730 --> 16:35.081
without any lingering
resentment.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.343
Uh, Captain?

16:36.386 --> 16:38.475
Uh, there is one thing.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.694
What?

16:39.737 --> 16:41.826
[chuffing]

16:41.870 --> 16:44.438
Why am I wearing
this itchy hair hat?

16:44.481 --> 16:45.656
Is this it?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.876
No.
You have to talk to each other.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.921
[clears throat]
Thank you, Captain,

16:49.965 --> 16:52.446
for agreeing to do... this.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.491
No, you have to do the accent.

16:54.535 --> 16:55.665
[groans]

16:55.710 --> 16:57.755
[Southern accent]:
I say, uh, uh, uh, uh,

16:57.799 --> 16:59.888
my-my good creature,

16:59.931 --> 17:03.370
uh, the moral arc
of history is a m...

17:03.413 --> 17:06.068
Oh, what the hell am I
supposed to say, Lieutenant?

17:06.112 --> 17:07.939
Homespun aphorisms
about compromise.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.464
[roars]

17:10.507 --> 17:12.727
Okay, uh, maybe you try that
in a Southern accent.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.512
[exclaims]
I am from South Chalnoth.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.123
That was a Southern accent.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.125
[roars]

17:19.167 --> 17:21.040
Whoa!

17:21.083 --> 17:22.084
[grunting]

17:22.127 --> 17:23.520
[glass breaking]

17:23.564 --> 17:24.868
[regular accent]:
What the hell made you two think

17:24.913 --> 17:26.393
-this would work?
-We-we were arguing a lot

17:26.435 --> 17:27.829
and we both dressed
like Mark Twain.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.178
Something about us
talking old-timey

17:29.222 --> 17:31.441
helped us figure out
who should water our bonsai.

17:31.485 --> 17:34.575
What is bonsai?

17:39.623 --> 17:40.929
Oh, oh, watch out.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.409
There's a loose panel
over there.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.107
Curious. You seem familiar
with this location,

17:45.151 --> 17:46.978
yet it appears to be abandoned.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.591
D'Erika and I used to sneak
away here when we were little.

17:50.634 --> 17:54.073
There!
That was one of our favorites.

17:55.639 --> 17:59.121
I loved pretending I was
off-planet, exploring space.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.688
Doing anything other
than pirating.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.435
Guys, I have to come clean
about something.

18:08.478 --> 18:12.134
I wasn't just a regular
Orion teenager.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.093
-I was trained to be
a Syndicate assassin.
-MARINER: Tendi, yeah,

18:14.136 --> 18:15.398
we know, girl.
You can't just say

18:15.442 --> 18:17.226
you're joking around
when you kick-flip a knife

18:17.270 --> 18:20.055
-out of the air.
-Your upbringing
was quite obvious.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.884
I just hate that you guys
had to see the real me.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.060
Tends, the real you is the one

18:25.104 --> 18:27.410
who geeks out about science
on the Cerritos.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.718
But I'm a prime, you know?
A... a trained assassin.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.242
It's-it's the most piratey
someone can be.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.505
Incorrect.
You are who you choose to be.

18:35.549 --> 18:38.639
A Starfleet lieutenant
and a loyal friend.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.510
Don't worry, we know
you're a big nerd

18:40.554 --> 18:43.034
and not some hot assassin.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.645
[sighs]
That is the nicest thing

18:44.688 --> 18:47.387
anyone's ever said to me.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.390
It's so weird to be here.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.001
This is where I told my sister
that I was joining Starfleet.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.917
More like where you decided
to abandon your family.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.007
TENDI:
D'Erika?!

19:04.055 --> 19:06.580
-Hey, we did it.
Case closed.
-You kidnapped yourself.

19:06.623 --> 19:09.496
Wow, did Starfleet teach you
those amazing detective skills?

19:09.539 --> 19:11.411
Was this just to get me
to show up for the wedding?

19:11.454 --> 19:12.629
I would have just come.

19:12.673 --> 19:13.630
Classic D'Vana--

19:13.674 --> 19:15.502
always assuming it's about you.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.504
[grunting]

19:18.592 --> 19:21.595
Ha, ha. Nope.
I'm gonna stand way over here.

19:21.638 --> 19:22.944
Fascinating.
Orions primarily

19:22.987 --> 19:24.641
resolve disputes
through violence.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.077
No, no, that is not true.
[weak chuckle]

19:26.121 --> 19:28.906
D'Erika, please,
can we just talk about this?

19:28.950 --> 19:30.604
I'll let my blade
do the talking.

19:31.648 --> 19:34.129
[grunts]
Oh, come on!

19:34.173 --> 19:35.913
-D'Erika, don't stab my friends.
-[chuckles]

19:35.957 --> 19:37.654
What are you gonna
do about it?

19:37.698 --> 19:41.180
Teach you how to respect
your prime. [grunts]

19:42.311 --> 19:46.489
Yes, yes. Beautiful.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.622
We love it, too.
Super hard to raise.

19:48.665 --> 19:49.797
Yeah, he's basically
a son to us.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.146
Every day we have to make sure

19:51.190 --> 19:53.061
-he gets just the right
amount of...

19:53.104 --> 19:54.671

19:54.715 --> 19:56.717
Now I'm thirsty for mist.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.066
[glugging]

19:58.109 --> 20:01.112
I'm sated.
You may inspect the nebula.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.898
But pray I don't change my mind.

20:03.941 --> 20:07.249
Yes, yes, you are
very intimidating.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.425
-Thank you.
-[door whooshes open]

20:11.384 --> 20:13.037
-Lil Boney.
-Lil Boney.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.605
[grunting] I don't get it.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.520
Why do this?
Why kidnap yourself?

20:17.564 --> 20:19.261
Because I knew
it was the only way

20:19.305 --> 20:20.523
to get you to come home.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.221
-[grunts]
-You didn't invite me.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.744
Oh, would you have even come?
[grunting]

20:23.787 --> 20:25.528
You haven't been home once
since you left.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.009
Yeah, I've kind of been busy.
Hiyah!

20:28.052 --> 20:30.620
[grunting]

20:30.664 --> 20:32.013
With what-- scanning?

20:32.056 --> 20:34.276
Why is Starfleet
so obsessed with scanning?

20:34.320 --> 20:35.538
To learn stuff!

20:35.582 --> 20:38.802
-You abandoned me for science.
-[grunting]

20:38.846 --> 20:40.935
Don't.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.721
You were trained from birth

20:44.765 --> 20:46.288
to be
the Tip of the Moonlit Blade,

20:46.332 --> 20:48.682
the greatest duty
of the Mistress

20:48.725 --> 20:51.032
of the Winter Constellations.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.208
I didn't ask for that.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.166
Neither did I.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.952
[grunts]

20:57.995 --> 20:59.997
You forced this on me
without asking.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.609
Running to Starfleet
was your choice,

21:02.652 --> 21:04.654
but it meant all your duties
fell on me.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.917
I had to train,
I had to be the Mistress.

21:06.961 --> 21:09.224
I had to drop my whole life
to become the new prime.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.662
You're right. I should have
talked to you before I left

21:12.706 --> 21:15.709
instead of just assuming
you'd want to take my place.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.014
I'm sorry.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.279
[grunts]

21:21.802 --> 21:24.326
Of course I wanted
to take your place.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.936
But I'm no D'Vana Tendi.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.590
Once I'm married,
people are going to see

21:27.634 --> 21:29.331
that I'm a pale comparison.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.680
Are you kidding me?

21:30.724 --> 21:32.421
The only reason
I felt comfortable leaving

21:32.465 --> 21:35.119
was because I knew you would
be better at it than me.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.166
You just kicked my butt.
You're an amazing prime.

21:38.209 --> 21:41.300
[sighs] I guess I did
kick it a little bit.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.866
A lot a bit.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.304
D'Erika, I always loved science.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.088
That was my path.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.655
This is yours.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.613
Yeah, lady, if you're worried
about not being a badass,

21:50.657 --> 21:52.311
I have some good news for you.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.835
I, too, was alarmed
by your combat abilities.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.402
You really think I can do this?

21:56.445 --> 21:58.795
You absolutely belong
on the Crime Throne.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.668
That means a lot. [gasps]
What time is it?

22:01.711 --> 22:03.191
The bridal procession
is scheduled to begin

22:03.234 --> 22:04.410
in under two hours.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.194
We are never
going to make it back in time.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.891
[grunts]
I might not be a pirate,

22:07.935 --> 22:10.633
but I've rerouted my fair share
of EPS conduits.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.983
Who wants to hotwire
a stolen ship?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.508
-I do not.
-Oh, stop, stop, stop. We're in.

22:23.516 --> 22:24.995
D'ERIKA:
See?

22:25.039 --> 22:27.998
Sometimes being an Orion pirate
isn't so bad.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.349
Yeah, it does come in handy.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.786
I know you're turning in
your observations

22:32.829 --> 22:34.831
to the High Council
but maybe could you leave off

22:34.875 --> 22:36.224
some of the stabbings?

22:36.267 --> 22:39.706
Curious. My report appears
to have been damaged.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.884
Orion culture will have
to remain undocumented.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.102
But why?

22:45.146 --> 22:46.887
A report without
the subject's consent

22:46.930 --> 22:49.106
-would be unethical.
-[alarm blaring]

22:50.064 --> 22:52.501
-Oh, no!
-I think the plasma manifold
just ruptured.

Ah, he looks radiant.

And, uh, this is when D'Erika

23:34.238 --> 23:36.545
swung her husband
across the threshold.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.374
Yeah, well, our bonsai
got gobbled up by a Chalnoth.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.332
Yeah, yeah,
a-and the captain forbid us

23:41.376 --> 23:43.117
from playing Mark Twain
on the holodeck.

23:43.160 --> 23:47.687
Are you guys jealous?
Ugh, it was just a wedding.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.950
Why would we ever want to go
to an awesome pirate wedding

23:49.993 --> 23:52.474
on a planet
nobody ever gets to see?!

23:52.518 --> 23:54.041
Aw, sorry you can't
release some of this anger

23:54.084 --> 23:55.608
with Mr. Clemens.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.871
Shockingly, it's not
the universal problem solver

23:57.914 --> 24:00.351
-we thought it was.
-Yeah, but we've got it covered.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.962
Ooh, like, today
we were arguing about whether

24:02.005 --> 24:03.790
to hang an oil painting
of the Enterprise-D

24:03.833 --> 24:05.487
or watercolor
of the Enterprise-D.

24:05.531 --> 24:06.662
Well, you guys just
talked about your feelings

24:06.706 --> 24:07.837
with honesty, right?

24:07.881 --> 24:10.840
Yeah, I guess
we could try that.
