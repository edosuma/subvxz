WEBVTT

00:03.916 --> 00:04.961
Hey.

00:05.048 --> 00:05.744
Where you been?

00:05.830 --> 00:07.398
At the mall.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.009
Wanted to buy you
some pretty maternity clothes.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.620
And?There are none.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.101
Here's a churro.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.235
What's all this?
Mm.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.933
The adoption agency sent over
some more profiles.

00:21.021 --> 00:21.847
What about the two guys
you liked in San Francisco?

00:21.934 --> 00:23.371
Yeah.

00:23.458 --> 00:26.852
I thought this was
gonna be their "gayby."

00:26.939 --> 00:28.985
They bailed.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.552
What happened?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.075
They asked if alcoholism
runs in the family.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.990
Our bad.Sorry.

00:37.428 --> 00:40.301
So, you find anyone
else you like?

00:40.388 --> 00:41.780
Yeah, lots of people.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.043
Um, these are
the yeses.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.783
And those
are the nos?
No.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.089
Those just fell and I wasn't
able to pick them up.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.442
Wow, all these people

00:51.529 --> 00:52.922
trying so hard to have
a kid and they can't.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.967
It's not fair.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.621
Yeah, all I needed to have you

00:56.708 --> 00:58.275
was a bottle of Jack,
an eight ball

00:58.362 --> 00:59.929
and a Supertramp album.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.236
Aw...

01:02.323 --> 01:04.977
I can never hear
that story enough.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.415
So how's Luke doing?

01:07.502 --> 01:08.938
He coming around
to the idea of adoption?

01:09.025 --> 01:10.287
I don't know.

01:10.374 --> 01:11.723
We're not talking.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.508
I'm sorry.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.249
I'm just hoping
once I find the perfect couple,

01:15.336 --> 01:17.381
he'll realize
that this is for the best.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.383
Patty and
Russell Callahan.

01:19.470 --> 01:20.689
These people seem okay.

01:20.776 --> 01:21.951
Nice house, nice car.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.387
Uh-oh.

01:23.474 --> 01:24.867
They got married at Disneyland.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.999
Losers.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.479
Ooh.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.307
How about the Pattersons?

01:30.394 --> 01:32.962
They're into fishing, hunting
and amateur taxidermy.

01:33.049 --> 01:35.138
Passeroo.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.401
Mindy and Manny Klein.

01:37.488 --> 01:40.709
"We may be barren,
but we're really carin'."

01:43.103 --> 01:45.931
No, thank you.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.977
I'm kind of liking these people.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.675
Jeff and
Suzanne Taylor.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.286
They look sweet.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.722
There's just something
about this picture.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.376
If I fell and scraped my knee,

01:55.463 --> 01:56.203
I'd want this lady
to kiss my boo-boo.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.120
She's an artist
and he designs video games.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.991
Cute house.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.340
Little log
cabin-y, but...

02:03.427 --> 02:05.516
Wait, that's their lake house.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.736
Let's see the house house.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.478
ALL:
Oh, my God.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.235
To be honest, I've been
really struggling

02:28.322 --> 02:30.019
the last couple of weeks.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.240
My daughter's gonna
have a baby next month and...

02:33.327 --> 02:33.936
GROUP:
Aw.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.242
No, no, no.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.460
She's giving it
up for adoption.

02:36.547 --> 02:39.159
GROUP:
Oh.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.291
And that, right there,
is the hardest part.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.946
Telling people.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.470
Just today I ran into a friend
at the grocery store

02:46.557 --> 02:48.559
and she was all,
"Oh, you must be so excited

02:48.646 --> 02:50.257
about becoming a grandmother."

02:50.344 --> 02:51.954
I had to go through
the whole thing with her.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.086
I'm thinking of just
getting a T-shirt that says,

02:54.174 --> 02:56.132
"We're not keeping it."

02:56.219 --> 02:59.614
You know, a little picture of
a baby with a line through it.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.965
[sighs]
Anyway,

03:03.052 --> 03:04.662
my daughter's being strong,

03:04.749 --> 03:07.317
and I'm trying to be
strong for her.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.538
And my mom's around.

03:11.408 --> 03:14.194
Thank you.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.414
We'll take a ten-minute break.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.547
Help yourself
to coffee and cookies.

03:19.634 --> 03:22.202
Uh, hey... actually,
just coffee.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.986
I was in charge
of the cookies

03:24.073 --> 03:26.249
and the whole grandma thing
happened at the store and...

03:26.336 --> 03:28.425
Sorry.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.429
Hey.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.170
Hi. Christy, right?

03:34.257 --> 03:36.085
Yeah. Hi, um...

03:37.695 --> 03:39.828
Ooh, I know that
you're two weeks sober

03:39.915 --> 03:41.873
and were touched inappropriately
by your babysitter,

03:41.960 --> 03:42.526
but I don't remember your name.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.746
Steve.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.530
Steve! Right. Hi, Steve.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.054
Um, this is
my mother, Bonnie.

03:49.141 --> 03:49.751
Hello.
Yeah, hi. Steve.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.796
I got it.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.145
STEVE:
So, listen.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
Uh, just wanted
to make you aware

03:54.321 --> 03:56.148
that I practice family law,

03:56.236 --> 03:57.802
and in the event that you're
looking for an adoption attorney

03:57.889 --> 03:59.935
for your daughter,
I'd like to offer my services.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.764
Thanks, but we're good.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.548
We're just gonna let
the agency handle it.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.115
Ooh, you don't want to do that.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.508
Adoption agencies
only care about one thing:

04:07.595 --> 04:09.771
placing the baby
and getting their fee.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.425
What do you care about?

04:11.512 --> 04:13.078
Getting my fee.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.254
And you, of course.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.343
How much do
you charge?

04:16.430 --> 04:18.257
Well, my hourly rate
is $400...
Whew.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.259
$250.
Ha.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.781
$120.
Whoo!

04:20.869 --> 04:21.608
I can get my fee
from the adoptive parents.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.741
You're hired.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.569
Welcome to the team.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.618
I don't understand.
Why do we need a lawyer?

04:30.705 --> 04:32.272
Seriously? You grew
up in this family

04:32.359 --> 04:33.403
and you're questioning
the need for a lawyer?

04:37.625 --> 04:38.626
Okay.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.105
Where'd you find this guy?

04:40.192 --> 04:42.238
We, um...

04:44.196 --> 04:47.112
...recently heard him speak
at a social event.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.202
Oh, God, he's a drunk?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.336
He's not a drunk.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.555
Anymore.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.122
And he's free.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.907
[sighs]
Anyway, he says that

04:58.994 --> 05:01.083
you have to get Luke
to sign his rights away

05:01.170 --> 05:02.606
before the adoption
can go forward.

05:02.693 --> 05:03.912
How could I do that?

05:03.999 --> 05:04.521
Luke's dead-set against it.

05:04.608 --> 05:07.176
Hmm.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.220
Would you mind
if I talked to him?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.222
Yes, I would.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.441
Stay out of it.

05:11.528 --> 05:14.662
Hey, I am just trying to help.

05:14.749 --> 05:18.230
Believe me, I've got much better
things to do with my time.

05:20.755 --> 05:21.886
Next, please.

05:23.584 --> 05:24.498
Hey, Luke.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.629
Oh, hi!

05:25.716 --> 05:27.065
Can we talk?

05:27.152 --> 05:29.198
I'm actually
kind of busy now.

05:29.285 --> 05:32.244
Okay, I'll order something.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.551
How's the fried fish sandwich?

05:34.638 --> 05:37.467
It's a lightly-breaded
seafood treat.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.687
[quietly]: I don't
think it's really fish.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.342
Okay, then,
I'll take a cheeseburger.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.040
One cheeseburger.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.737
I need to talk to you
about the adoption.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.522
Yeah, I don't want
to talk about that.

05:48.609 --> 05:49.349
Would you like
fries and a drink?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.743
Sure. Small Coke.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.964
Look, I know what it's like
to have a baby at your age.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.313
I struggled
to make ends meet,

05:57.400 --> 05:59.228
and I'm still struggling.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.795
If you get
the large Coke,

06:00.882 --> 06:02.318
it's 50 cents cheaper
and you get a free toy.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.319
Sounds great.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.800
One Happy Slappy Meal.

06:05.887 --> 06:06.453
Here or to go?

06:06.540 --> 06:09.020
To go.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.979
Anyway, Violet found this

06:11.066 --> 06:12.546
wonderful couple
who really want to adopt a baby,

06:12.633 --> 06:15.592
and they're coming
by the house tomorrow.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.638
That's $4.28.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.291
[sighs]

06:19.379 --> 06:21.119
Why don't you just drop by

06:21.206 --> 06:24.209
and meet them
and see what you think?

06:24.296 --> 06:25.776
I already know what I think.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.299
Come on, Luke.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.605
Your order will be
up in a minute.

06:28.692 --> 06:29.606
Next, please.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.608
[baby crying]

06:31.695 --> 06:32.914
Coincidence?

06:33.001 --> 06:33.480
I think not.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.009
[mouthing]

06:47.232 --> 06:48.320
Seriously?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.888
That's my lawyer?

06:50.975 --> 06:53.282
You get what you pay for, honey.

06:53.369 --> 06:55.153
Talk to him.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.894
Well, isn't that rude?

06:56.981 --> 06:58.243
He seems to be in the
middle of a conversation.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.984
Go.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.466
What's going on, Counselor?

07:03.553 --> 07:04.859
Nothing, everything's fine.

07:04.946 --> 07:05.816
You sure?

07:05.903 --> 07:07.949
No, I can't do it.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.603
I've never practiced law
without being loaded.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.909
My brain is very
angry at me.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.085
We good here?

07:14.172 --> 07:14.782
I think he's detoxing.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.479
Really?

07:16.566 --> 07:18.568
You seemed fine
at the meeting.

07:18.655 --> 07:21.528
I was high as a kite
at the meeting!

07:21.615 --> 07:22.572
[doorbell rings]

07:24.966 --> 07:26.097
Okay, that's the Taylors.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.403
Nobody be themselves.

07:32.495 --> 07:33.496
Luke.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.628
Hey.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.194
What are you
doing here?

07:36.281 --> 07:37.674
I came to meet this couple.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.850
VIOLET:
How'd you even know?

07:39.937 --> 07:43.332
Your mother showed up
at my job and told me.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.335
I was in the mood
for a Happy Slappy Meal.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.688
Thanks.

07:51.775 --> 07:55.692
So you're okay with all this?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.520
I don't know.
I'm just here to listen.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.742
Knock, knock.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.570
Hi.
You must be Violet.

08:03.657 --> 08:04.658
Uh, yes.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.442
I'm Suzanne.
This is Jeff.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.575
I'm Jeff.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.228
Oh, please come in.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.710
Hello.
This is my mom
Christy...

08:13.797 --> 08:14.929
Hi, it's nice
to meet you.
...and my
grandmother Bonnie.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.060
Nice to meet you.And that's Luke,

08:16.147 --> 08:16.844
the baby's father.Hello.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.498
Hi.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.978
Hey. Oh, um...
sorry about the sweaty hands,

08:21.065 --> 08:22.589
I-I'm really nervous.
[chuckles]

08:22.676 --> 08:24.591
Me, too.

08:24.678 --> 08:29.291
And, uh, this is our
attorney, Steve Curtis.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.901
We can discuss my fee later.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.472
Please, come,
sit down.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.126
You have
a lovely home.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.520
Not really, but thank you.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.005
BONNIE:
So...

08:48.092 --> 08:49.877
you want to
adopt a baby.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.008
Yes, we do.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.271
You're in luck.
We have one.

08:57.754 --> 09:01.105
Quiet time.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.542
I read a lot
of profiles,

09:02.629 --> 09:04.631
and yours really stuck out.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.981
Oh, thanks.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.984
Suzanne did the artwork,
and I wrote the copy.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.768
She wanted to go with
the Helvetica font,

09:11.855 --> 09:14.597
uh, but I insisted on Courier
to make it easier to read.

09:14.684 --> 09:17.208
We compromised
with Times New Roman.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.472
Honey, they don't
want to hear that.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.473
Why?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.823
Everyone likes fonts.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.566
I like fonts.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.699
Wingdings are my favorite.

09:29.786 --> 09:33.747
Do you have any questions
you would like to ask us?

09:33.834 --> 09:36.401
Why can't you have
your own baby?

09:36.488 --> 09:37.664
Luke.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.143
No, that's a
fair question.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.972
We tried to get
pregnant for many years.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.148
It just didn't
work out.

09:44.235 --> 09:47.499
She has a tilted uterus,
and I have a low sperm count.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.980
It's like shooting blanks
into an empty canyon.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.637
No matter how many times
we had intercourse,

09:54.724 --> 09:56.683
nothing ever happened.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.598
And we tried
some pretty weird positions.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.080
Please go back
to fonts.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.908
TMI?
TMI.

10:04.995 --> 10:08.303
So, your profile said
you design video games?

10:08.390 --> 10:10.305
Yes, I design video games.

10:11.741 --> 10:12.699
Is that still too much?

10:12.786 --> 10:15.963
No, too little.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.617
Um, do you know the game
Clumsy Monkey?

10:17.704 --> 10:18.966
No way. I love
Clumsy Monkey.

10:19.053 --> 10:21.229
How do you get
past level seven?

10:21.316 --> 10:23.492
Oh. [laughs]
That stumps everyone.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.146
You have to get
the monkey through

10:25.233 --> 10:27.191
the china shop
without breaking anything.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.976
But he's so clumsy.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.849
Try swinging
from the chandelier.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.330
The chandelier.
Of course!

10:35.417 --> 10:39.116
Anyway, we just want you to
know that if you do choose us,

10:39.203 --> 10:42.380
we will do everything
we can to give your baby

10:42.467 --> 10:47.037
a great life and love him
or her with all of our hearts.

10:49.518 --> 10:53.087
Hey, you're making the rest of
us look pretty bad here, sister.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.523
[laughs]

10:56.133 --> 10:58.745
What do you think?

10:58.832 --> 11:01.486
I think you're
really nice people,

11:01.573 --> 11:05.229
and I hope you have your baby
someday, but not this one.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.144
Luke...I'm sorry, I can't.

11:07.231 --> 11:07.797
No, Luke.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.712
Luke...

11:12.062 --> 11:13.020
[door closes]

11:13.107 --> 11:15.370
[hushed]:
How am I doing?

11:22.464 --> 11:24.553
I'm really sorry.It's okay.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.989
We've been
through this before.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.122
We had an adoption
fall through last year.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.819
We walked the birth mother
through the whole pregnancy,

11:29.906 --> 11:33.127
decorated a nursery,
were at the hospital

11:33.214 --> 11:36.696
for the birth, and then
the mother changed her mind.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.393
I actually tried
using alcohol

11:38.480 --> 11:40.308
to numb my pain.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.876
Well, we certainly
understand that.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.836
I just did not like
how it made me feel.

11:46.923 --> 11:50.187
And you lost us.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.062
I think that if you give Luke

11:55.149 --> 11:56.890
a little more time,
he'll come around.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.501
I'm sorry,
but we already drove home once

11:59.588 --> 12:02.504
with an empty baby seat
in the back of the car.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.419
We can't
go through that again.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.334
Let's go.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.988
It was really nice to meet you.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.641
It was nice
meeting you.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.033
Good luck.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.083
[sighs]

12:16.170 --> 12:19.564
I better go check
on Violet.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.523
Why don't you
get rid of him.

12:21.610 --> 12:22.872
[sobbing]

12:30.010 --> 12:31.576
[knocking]

12:33.578 --> 12:34.754
What you doing?

12:34.841 --> 12:35.885
Tossing out
all this college crap.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.887
Why?

12:37.974 --> 12:40.498
What do you mean, "Why?"
Because I'm not going.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.413
I'll keep the baby,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.851
and maybe when it's 16,
17 years old and hates my guts,

12:44.938 --> 12:46.374
then I'll look at college.

12:46.461 --> 12:50.378
Oh, they hate you
sooner than that.

12:53.033 --> 12:56.993
Come on. Luke may
still change his mind.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.561
And just because
we lost the Taylors

12:59.648 --> 13:01.041
doesn't mean there's not
another great couple out there.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.869
I wanted them.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.827
You sure?

13:04.914 --> 13:07.612
He's kind of weird.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.790
Yeah, but he's cool weird.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.226
Big Bangweird.

13:14.706 --> 13:18.188
And she's, like, the best mom
you could ever ask for.

13:18.275 --> 13:21.235
Okay, I'm just
gonna let that go.

13:24.673 --> 13:25.935
You know what I mean.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.111
I do. And I'm
letting it go.

13:30.157 --> 13:33.029
I'm so sorry.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.945
No, it's better this way.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.557
[footsteps]

13:41.081 --> 13:43.474
Sorry to break this up,

13:43.561 --> 13:45.825
but we've got a
lawyer on the roof.

13:49.959 --> 13:53.310
Here you go.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.878
And enjoy your meal.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.576
Excuse me, Christy.

13:58.663 --> 14:02.015
Uh, a very young man is
asking for you at the bar.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.408
I'm making up next
week's schedule.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.542
Should I put you on it, or
will you be going to jail?

14:07.629 --> 14:10.066
What? No.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.155
He's my daughter's boyfriend.

14:12.242 --> 14:15.942
It's too bad.
I was in the mood to judge.

14:16.029 --> 14:18.945
What are you doing here?I need to talk.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.382
But I'm in the middle
of my shift.

14:21.469 --> 14:22.774
Now you know
how it feels.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.561
Okay, what do you want?

14:26.648 --> 14:28.128
I need some advice, and you're
the smartest person I know.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.305
Oh, well, thanks,

14:31.392 --> 14:34.612
and I'm sorry you don't know
more people.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.527
The reason I don't want
to give the baby up

14:36.614 --> 14:38.181
is 'cause I don't
want to lose Violet.

14:38.268 --> 14:41.532
Wait, you're fighting
this whole adoption thing

14:41.619 --> 14:43.099
because you're afraid
she'll dump you?

14:43.186 --> 14:44.100
Well, yeah.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.450
Violet's really smart.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.148
Without the baby, she can go
to college and be somebody.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.628
And I'm probably gonna
be flipping burgers

14:50.715 --> 14:52.630
for the rest of my life.

14:52.717 --> 14:56.286
Oh, sweetie, that's the wrong
reason to keep the baby.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.462
What's the right reason?

14:58.549 --> 15:00.464
'Cause you want a baby.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.728
All I really want
is Violet.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.687
[sighs]

15:05.774 --> 15:07.907
Look, I can't promise that the
two of you are gonna be together

15:07.994 --> 15:09.996
for the rest of your lives,
but I can promise you

15:10.083 --> 15:12.346
that if you use this kid
as a bargaining chip,

15:12.433 --> 15:13.477
you guys are done.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.349
You think?

15:15.436 --> 15:18.091
You want to make sure
that she doesn't outgrow you?

15:18.178 --> 15:21.007
Then for heaven's sake, grow up.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.182
Make something of yourself.

15:24.314 --> 15:27.535
My father's pushing me to go
to a Christian university

15:27.622 --> 15:28.753
and become a preacher.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.972
That's cool.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.496
What's stopping you?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.542
I only believe in God
when I'm high.

15:36.631 --> 15:40.461
All right, let's put a pin
in that and keep thinking.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.946
You're sure you're okay
with all this?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.121
Yeah.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.645
Okay, Steve,
you're up.

15:50.732 --> 15:53.691
[sighs]:
Okay.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.568
Easy.

16:01.569 --> 16:02.265
Easy.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.227
Here you go.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.404
The Relinquishment
of Parental Rights.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.145
Sign here.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.364
[sighs]

16:14.451 --> 16:15.887
Proud of you.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.541
You did this without
alcohol or drugs.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.545
Thanks.
Thanks.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.377
We're doing
the right thing, Luke.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.121
So what now?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.080
I have to file
this at court.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.604
Can somebody
give me a lift?

16:36.691 --> 16:38.127
You don't have a car?

16:38.214 --> 16:39.476
I have a car.
I don't have a license.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.698
We'll drive you. Come on.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.220
Shotgun!

16:48.224 --> 16:50.792
Do you still love me?

16:50.879 --> 16:52.837
I never stopped
loving you.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.279
Smartest person I know.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.546
Can I say
something horrible?

17:05.633 --> 17:07.722
Since when do you ask?

17:09.376 --> 17:11.900
I can't wait for
this to be over.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.510
I know.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.685
I'm trying to hold it
together for Violet,

17:15.772 --> 17:18.428
but it's like I'm waiting and
waiting for my heart to break.

17:18.515 --> 17:22.127
Yeah, this is the hardest thing
I've ever gone through.

17:22.214 --> 17:23.999
And I was raised by you.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.089
Good one.

17:27.175 --> 17:28.960
It wasn't a joke.

17:30.962 --> 17:34.183
I just keep telling myself
that my daughter's gonna have

17:34.270 --> 17:37.012
a better life
because of this decision.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.274
College, maybe graduate school.

17:38.361 --> 17:41.190
Yeah.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.105
Why don't you go back to school?

17:43.192 --> 17:47.240
Believe it or not,
I've been thinking about it.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.198
That's terrific.
What do you want to do?

17:49.285 --> 17:51.418
Promise not to laugh?

17:51.505 --> 17:52.332
No.

17:55.291 --> 17:59.687
Okay, well, ever since
I was a little girl,

17:59.774 --> 18:02.124
I've wanted to be a lawyer.

18:02.211 --> 18:05.301
Really?
What brought that about?

18:05.388 --> 18:07.608
I don't know.
Maybe it had something to do

18:07.695 --> 18:10.089
with watching the police
haul my mother off to jail

18:10.176 --> 18:13.266
and wishing I could do something
about it.

18:13.353 --> 18:18.836
So what I'm hearing is
I inspired you.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.969
Yeah, that's it.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.231
Hey, maybe you can ask Steve
for some advice

18:22.318 --> 18:24.581
as to how to get started.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.670
You know, after he stops
hallucinating.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.456
I just might.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.157
Wow. This is exciting.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.507
Right?

18:37.594 --> 18:38.900
Come here.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.252
I am so proud of you.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.776
Thanks, Mom.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.343
To be honest, I've always
been a little embarrassed

18:47.430 --> 18:49.780
you were a waitress.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.662
I just want you to know
that you are always welcome

19:01.749 --> 19:03.272
to be a part
of this baby's life.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.100
It's totally your call.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.018
I would like that
very much.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.195
I'd like it, too.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.718
Same for me.

19:14.805 --> 19:15.589
Especially if we can visit
at your lake house.

19:18.418 --> 19:19.897
Hey,

19:19.984 --> 19:21.421
so what are your plans
after high school?

19:21.508 --> 19:23.510
I don't know.

19:23.597 --> 19:24.424
Probably go to the beach.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.429
I think he means
long-term.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.996
Oh. No idea.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.390
How'd you like to
come and work for me,

19:34.477 --> 19:35.609
learn how to design
video games?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.567
Seriously?

19:37.654 --> 19:39.308
Why not?

19:39.395 --> 19:40.483
I was your age when I came
up with Clumsy Monkey.

19:40.570 --> 19:41.876
That's so weird.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.530
I was my age when
I started playing it.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.663
Then it's meant to be.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.230
Thanks.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.884
Oh, oh.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.277
[whispers]: You want
another kid, just say the word.
