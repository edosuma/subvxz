WEBVTT

00:08.142 --> 00:09.143
[Door creaks]

00:09.177 --> 00:11.245
**

00:11.279 --> 00:13.281
Whoo!

00:13.314 --> 00:16.650
Mexico. Finally.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.553
I've always felt
at home down here.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.755
The play of light
and shadow.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.757
The surreal quality
of death.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.628
It's all so goddamn
voluptuous.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.098
Many great writers have
disappeared in Mexico.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.334
Ambrose Bierce.
Oscar Zeta Acosta.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.703
Maybe I'm next.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.571
I-I hope not, Lamar.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.573
No, it might be
just the thing.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.942
Disappearing in Mexico
would boost my sales.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.278
Seems kind of small
for a lodge.

00:44.312 --> 00:47.047
The original building
was foreclosed.

00:47.081 --> 00:51.785
So El Confidente moved it.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.654
He was the last
member left.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.989
Keeping the flame alive, huh?

00:56.023 --> 00:58.826
It's beautiful. The lodge
is where you take it.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.294
[Laughing] Yeah.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.063
[Gunshot]

01:03.097 --> 01:06.300
[All screaming]

01:06.334 --> 01:07.835
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.803
[Groans]

01:09.837 --> 01:12.806
No! Don't!

01:12.840 --> 01:14.542
Oh, hey, guys!

01:14.575 --> 01:16.710
Huh? Oh!

01:16.744 --> 01:18.546
H-Hey! Daphne.
Hey!

01:18.579 --> 01:19.680
Oh, man.
Oh.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.382
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.352
There's been a lot of cartel
activity in the area, but,

01:24.385 --> 01:26.454
come on in.
I've been waiting for you.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.756
Come on. Yeah, come on.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.324
Come on in.
Whoa.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.092
Come on.
Oh, you want to hold it?

01:32.126 --> 01:33.861
It feels good.
It's heavy.
Uh, Dud?

01:33.894 --> 01:37.231
Yeah.
Would you do me
a favor, and, uh,

01:37.265 --> 01:39.533
get the toilet paper
out of the van?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.669
**

01:41.702 --> 01:44.004
Daphne: Oh, El Confidente
left those for you.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.574
Ernie: A Mariachi.
Every single time.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.976
It means something.
It definitely means something.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.311
[Chuckles]

01:50.344 --> 01:51.779
There are more
people coming.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.482
Huh?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.016
Look. See? [Laughs]

01:56.049 --> 01:57.785
I told you I saw Scott's truck
on the 5.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.919
They were behind us
the whole time.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.121
[Chuckles]

02:01.155 --> 02:03.524
Yeah.
Oh, look,
it's me and Liz.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.526
Daphne: Yeah, some of
the other paintings

02:05.559 --> 02:07.661
don't really make sense.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.697
Yeah.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.765
Okay. Now [laughs],

02:11.799 --> 02:15.536
for the record, I didn't shit
my pants out of fear.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.672
No, it was all that machaca
I ate on the way down.

02:18.706 --> 02:23.711
And, no, I'm not ashamed that my
muse saw me in a human moment.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.746
There's no secrets between us.

02:25.779 --> 02:31.585
[Speaks French]

02:31.619 --> 02:33.721
See?
Huh.

02:33.754 --> 02:38.926
So El Confidente made you
Sovereign Protector of Lodge 55?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.595
Right before he left
he put the ring on my finger

02:41.629 --> 02:42.930
and gave me his gun.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.932
I don't want to be all
Scott about this,

02:44.965 --> 02:47.835
but you can't just become
Sovereign Protector.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.537
There are steps. Rules.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.704
You have to earn it.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.039
Like Ernie did.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.274
I mean, even though
he got screwed.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.776
Hey, I don't know if
I earned anything.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.378
I'm just a dude
who hung around.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.548
Oh, cometh the hour,
cometh the man.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.982
Just like Tom Stone says.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.952
Well, my hour never came
and that's cool.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.687
I wasn't meant for the throne.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.924
[Groans]
Well, I didn't ask for it.
El Confidente insisted.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.694
He said he was going
on a journey,

03:13.727 --> 03:18.632
but he didn't say where.
Something to do with his wife.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.601
God, he's a beautiful man.

03:23.371 --> 03:27.074
I cried when he asked me
to join the Order.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.476
And then I cut ties with Avery

03:28.509 --> 03:29.977
and the people
we were working for.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.179
I mean, screw Bitcoin, you know?

03:32.212 --> 03:35.316
I want the scrolls because
they're worthless junk

03:35.349 --> 03:37.518
and it is our destiny
to find them.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.819
[Chuckles]

03:38.852 --> 03:42.723
And here's the good news --

03:42.756 --> 03:44.358
I know where they are.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.994
[Knocking on door]
Wha-- Wait, [laughs] what?

03:47.027 --> 03:48.262
[Door creaks]

03:48.296 --> 03:50.398
-Hey! Hey, guys.
-You made it.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.666
Welcome to Lodge 55.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.468
Yep. Yeah.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.670
Yeah.
Oh.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.971
Yeah.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.473
Scott should be in
the middle, though.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.510
**

04:11.885 --> 04:14.888
**

04:24.498 --> 04:28.936
**

04:34.074 --> 04:37.177
Hey, Daphne, um, do you
happen to have a charger

04:37.210 --> 04:39.847
for this kind of phone because
I need to call my sister,

04:39.880 --> 04:40.914
let her know
that I'm okay.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.450
No. Sorry.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.217
It's just a little...

04:44.251 --> 04:45.185
No.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.287
Connie:
That looks like our Lodge.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.289
Holy crap.
What's this about?

04:49.323 --> 04:54.628
Ernie:
I don't know, but this...

04:54.662 --> 04:56.196
is you.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.598
Wow.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.133
It looks like I'm actually
writing something.

05:00.167 --> 05:03.236
[Chuckles]
You need to find
that place.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.539
Look, Scott, uh,
I'm glad you're here.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.842
I wanted to say --
That you're sorry
for shooting me?

05:08.876 --> 05:11.111
Well, I appreciate it.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.916
No, I wanted to say I forgive
you for banishing me.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.185
Like a dick.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.922
**

05:21.955 --> 05:23.357
Oh no --
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:23.391 --> 05:26.460
No, no, no, no, no.
Yep, this is how it goes.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.796
Yeah.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.498
That's it.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.434
You planning any sequels to
"The Heiress of Zanzibar"?

05:33.467 --> 05:37.571
I've, uh, I've written
another sextet.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.640
Another sextet.
[Chuckles]

05:39.673 --> 05:41.542
Wonderful.

05:41.575 --> 05:46.980
It's been a long time since
I've...had a sextet.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.551
On my shelf.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.586
[Exhales sharply]
I'll just get
another beer.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.321
Oh, sure.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.089
Uh, absolutely.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.859
I'll be here.
Okay.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.630
[Exhales sharply]

06:02.663 --> 06:05.466
Lamar,
she is so into you.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.134
You hear the way she
was saying sextet.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.802
Like she's saying "sex" without
saying it, you know?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.504
I know. I know.
I know. I know.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.873
But you have to
understand, Dud.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.643
I can play the game,
but only up to a point.

06:15.676 --> 06:21.815
If I let myself be seduced,
I'll lose my creative powers.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.518
[Exhales]
Yeah.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.386
But it would feel good.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.656
**

06:28.689 --> 06:30.924
[Clears throat]

06:30.958 --> 06:33.994
[Birds chirping]

06:34.027 --> 06:35.496
[Door opens]

06:35.529 --> 06:36.630
Hey!

06:36.664 --> 06:38.966
Where have you been?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.469
I've been strolling
the plaza.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.471
[Laughs]
I've never done that before.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.440
Just, you know, strolled.
It's great.

06:46.474 --> 06:50.110
I sat on a bench, drank
my coffee, looked around.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.045
I even popped in
the cathedral.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.847
It's beautiful.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.083
The naves and the altars
and all that shit.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.918
I didn't know you
were religious.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.820
Uh, I'm not,
but I grew up Catholic.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.823
So I'm cursed with
a sense of grandeur.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.291
I bought some pan dulce.

07:04.324 --> 07:08.896
I don't want
your confections, Liz.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.931
I want you to get
ahold of your brother.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.466
I keep trying,
but I told you.

07:12.500 --> 07:16.103
There's a 99% --
actually, a 100% chance

07:16.136 --> 07:18.539
that Dud forgot to
bring his phone charger.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.309
[Sighs]

07:22.342 --> 07:26.046
Oh, God!
This is a living death!

07:26.079 --> 07:28.348
I am so screwed.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.917
[Rustling]

07:29.950 --> 07:33.220
[Chewing]

07:35.388 --> 07:38.992
I'm glad you're having a good
time while my world collapses.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.460
Uh, this was never
gonna work.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.129
I tried telling you
that on the jet,

07:42.162 --> 07:43.764
but you just kept
eating crème brûlée.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.265
Excuse me.
I went to Stanford.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.200
I can see angles and strategies
that you can't.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.970
Absolutely.
But I still feel like

07:50.003 --> 07:52.239
searching for non-existent
scrolls in Mexico

07:52.272 --> 07:54.441
wasn't the best way to
solve your problem.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.110
You're gonna have to go home
and face things eventually.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.447
In the meantime, I'm gonna
enjoy your expense account.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.985
Liz, I want you
to punch me again.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.354
It's the only thing that
will make me feel alive.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.556
No.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.526
[Door closes]
[Sighs]

08:12.560 --> 08:16.129
Janet. I've failed you.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.033
I turned over every stone.
I can't find Lodge 55.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.871
[Bell tolling]

08:23.904 --> 08:25.939
It's over.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.345
We'll leave tomorrow.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.747
Great.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.015
Okay.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.784
I'm gonna book another spa
treatment,

08:36.817 --> 08:38.418
and then we can order up
some dinner.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.388
[Sighs]
You make me sick, Liz.

08:41.421 --> 08:45.859
Suckling at Janet's teat as
she's being led to slaughter.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.828
Uh, I'm getting
a hot stone massage.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.630
Do you want one?
[Scoffs]

08:49.663 --> 08:53.433
**

08:53.466 --> 08:55.235
Yeah, please.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.571
Okay, [exhales]
this is what I know.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.072
There's this Antiquarian --

08:59.106 --> 09:02.075
The Antiquarian is the dude
who killed Roberto Nuñez.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.077
And Roberto Nuñez
is the dude

09:04.111 --> 09:05.879
who got eaten by
the donkey-corn.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.181
Right.
Yes, the Antiquarian.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.084
His name is Tomás Villalobos.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.553
Now, he's the one
who stole the scrolls.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.757
But he died of a heart attack
a couple weeks ago,

09:16.790 --> 09:19.259
and El Confidente
heard all about it.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.663
Now this Villalobos guy,
[scoffs] he's a big deal.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.365
He sold us some of the richest
collectors in North America.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.169
He also had a massive personal
collection himself,

09:29.202 --> 09:32.305
and his family is holding
an estate sale

09:32.339 --> 09:35.208
tomorrow
at The Hotel Granada.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.010
If the scrolls are being
auctioned,

09:37.044 --> 09:38.578
won't they go
for millions?

09:38.612 --> 09:40.347
Oh, well, they're not listed.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.083
But there's a vintage bowling
bag in one of the lots.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.819
Ooh, ooh!
Larry's bowling bag!
Yes!

09:45.853 --> 09:47.655
And El Confidente
was confident

09:47.688 --> 09:49.456
that the scrolls
are in that bag.

09:49.489 --> 09:52.292
Lamar: Now listen,
everybody. Listen.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.629
This auction, like the auction
that Tom Stone shoots up

09:55.663 --> 09:59.532
in "The Antwerp Affair," will
draw a host of mysterious buyers

09:59.566 --> 10:01.234
from all over the globe.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.671
Huh?
Spies. Oligarchs.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.505
Uh, men with eyepatches.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.308
That's the world of antiquities.
Right?

10:08.341 --> 10:09.943
It's dangerous and cutthroat,

10:09.977 --> 10:12.112
and we need to be prepared
for anything.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.314
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:14.347 --> 10:15.783
Are you nuts?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.951
We're not bringing
a gun to the auction.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.152
Relax, Scott.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.488
It's Scott, right?
Relax, Scott.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.423
Tom Stone is an expert
in firearms.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.591
H-- Hey, hey.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.027
Which means Lamar is an expert
in firearms.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.596
Correct. That's right.
I write what I know.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.898
And from the heart.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.333
But if it'll make you feel
better, Scott,

10:33.366 --> 10:38.471
I will keep it inside the, uh,
lower pocket of my cargo shorts.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.573
Okay? [Laughs] Okay.

10:40.607 --> 10:43.944
Now, I'll call ahead and reserve
us some rooms at the Granada.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.345
We can soak up
the atmosphere

10:45.378 --> 10:46.914

That's not gonna work.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.198

with you.
Uh, I'm sorry,

but I can't sleep in
the same room as my muse.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.668
It floods the engine.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.003
I won't do it.
Ah.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.572
It -- It lacks decorum.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.040
Connie, I'm sorry.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.710
I'm not planning anything with,
um, uh, her.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.945
Or anyone else.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.881
Scott, don't apologize.
It's fine.

You're free to do whatever
you want now.

by the pool.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.059
Lamar, thank you.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.495
[Laughs]
I haven't had a vacation
in a while.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.698
Oh, yeah, but, Ernie, remember,
it's not a vacation.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.100
It is a quest.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.467
-Quest.
-Yes, for sure.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.203
So, um -- But obviously,
I'll be joining you, too.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.612

I'm going to lounge around

12:25.645 --> 12:28.882

kind of wretched prince.

on the plaza.

Okay.

No.
Guys, I know Guadalajara.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.437
The real Guadalajara.

12:50.470 --> 12:56.243
And tonight I'm taking you to

So, you and Connie --
I mean, I don't want to pry.

13:30.810 --> 13:35.048
We had a long talk
on the way down.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.518
So it was hard...but good.

glad Clara was along.

I've ever truly said

13:57.204 --> 14:00.040
how sorry I am about
the way things went down.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.309
Forget it. Just forget it.

You actually think there's gonna
be anything in that bowling bag?

14:16.123 --> 14:18.959
I do. Things get buried,
then they get found.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.360
That's the cycle
of history.

And even if there's
no scrolls,

14:22.930 --> 14:24.331
we'll still have
Larry's bowling bag,

fighting for.

to keep the scrolls.
