00:38.416 --> 00:40.375
[gloomy string music playing]

00:58.500 --> 01:02.416
I thought I was supposed to fight evil.
I thought that was the whole point.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.333
God, why do you have to argue
about everything?

01:05.958 --> 01:08.958
I'm your mother.
I think you'll be safer in France.

01:09.041 --> 01:10.083
I don't see how.

01:10.583 --> 01:13.250
Is Auntie Tera a vampire hunter? No.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.750
So, will I be safer with her? No.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.458
I should be here with you, fighting evil.

01:20.125 --> 01:21.250
[exhales]

01:22.208 --> 01:23.750
I'm sorry, Richter.

01:24.708 --> 01:27.458
I know it feels like I'm sending you away.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.125
You are sending me away.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.708
I'm so sorry, my darling.

01:34.708 --> 01:36.083
But I have no choice.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.708
-[man] Don't listen to her, Richter.
-[gasps softly]

01:39.791 --> 01:41.625

Olrox.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.791
Go to the ship, Richter.

02:06.458 --> 02:07.375
I'll catch you up.

02:07.458 --> 02:08.541
[sighs softly]

02:11.416 --> 02:13.250
You've made a big mistake.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.375
My mom is gonna slice you in two.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.125
[chuckles]

02:17.208 --> 02:20.125
In 250 years,

02:20.208 --> 02:24.791
do you know how many vampire hunters
have promised to slice me in two?

02:24.875 --> 02:27.166
Now, Richter. Go to the ship.

06:03.458 --> 06:05.208
Little boy Belmont.

06:10.708 --> 06:12.125
I know that feeling.

06:13.916 --> 06:14.916
That pain.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.583
That hate.

06:17.291 --> 06:21.166
That burning,
unendurable need for retribution.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.750
[gentle music playing]

06:22.833 --> 06:24.041
Because, you see,

06:24.791 --> 06:27.375
your mama took someone from me I loved,

06:28.125 --> 06:30.250
just as much as you loved her.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.375
So, she had to die.

06:33.916 --> 06:34.833
[whimpering]

06:34.916 --> 06:36.875
[Olrox] Oh, I could kill you too.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.750
-[breath shudders] And I will.
-[whimpering]

06:40.750 --> 06:41.750
[Olrox] One day.

[Maria] They claim it's the natural order.

[playing slow, classical music]

07:52.291 --> 07:54.458
[people conversing indistinctly]

07:55.375 --> 07:57.958
[Maria] They're born rich,
and we're born poor.

07:58.541 --> 08:00.291
And that's just the will of God.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.375
It's the natural order
for them to get rich by milking us dry

08:08.458 --> 08:10.916
with impossible rents and unpayable taxes.

08:12.916 --> 08:16.500
My mother hasn't paid her taxes
for years now

08:16.583 --> 08:18.250
because she's just too poor.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.583
Sooner or later
they'll send around their bully boys.

08:22.666 --> 08:23.500
[imperceptible]

08:23.583 --> 08:25.791
[Maria] And you all know
what I mean by that.

08:26.791 --> 08:29.833
They thought it would stay like that
until the end of time.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.166
[dramatic music playing faintly]

08:31.250 --> 08:34.500
Well, the king thought
it was his divine right to be king,

08:34.583 --> 08:36.583
but do you know what happened to him?

08:36.666 --> 08:38.625
He's been arrested.

08:38.708 --> 08:43.208
The government in Paris has overthrown
the monarchy and declared a republic.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.375
To hell with the natural order.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.875
No more kings, no more aristocrats.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.333
Vive la Révolution!

08:52.416 --> 08:54.875

10:28.625 --> 10:32.541
You can kill me, Richter Belmont,
but it won't do you any good.

10:33.125 --> 10:36.666
Before the moon is full,
the Vampire Messiah will come,

10:37.583 --> 10:40.291
the Devourer of Light,
who will eat the sun.

10:41.041 --> 10:46.250
You will suffer and die
along with everyone you love.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.625
That makes absolutely no sense.

10:49.708 --> 10:50.708

11:10.416 --> 11:14.458
I told you this was a damn stupid place
for a revolutionary meeting.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.916
[sighs] We'll just have to start
holding them in the town.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.958
I'm just worried people won't come.

11:19.041 --> 11:21.916
Maria, if they're more scared of gossips
than they are vampires,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.666
maybe they're not, you know,
revolutionary material.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.958
[Maria] What did it mean
by the "Vampire Messiah"?

11:28.041 --> 11:30.500
Who knows? What a ridiculous concept.

11:30.583 --> 11:34.291
[Maria] It might explain why there seem
to be more vampires around lately.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.000
They're gathering somewhere.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.166
The château, I wouldn't wonder.

11:38.833 --> 11:42.000
Well, it's where I'd go
if I was a vampire.

11:42.625 --> 11:43.875
Want to go and check?

11:45.625 --> 11:48.041
Jacques, let's get everyone back to town.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.291
"The Devourer of Light," it said.

11:53.875 --> 11:54.833
That sounds bad.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.000
Why come here?
What's so special about here?

11:59.500 --> 12:00.416
Ham and beans.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.375
The local ham and beans
is pretty sensational,

12:03.458 --> 12:05.625
makes local blood nice and smoky.

12:06.291 --> 12:07.541
God, you're a wanker.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.500
[Richter] Maybe we should
discuss this with the Abbot.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.708
I know he's no friend to the Revolution,

12:20.791 --> 12:23.833
but he can't be much of a friend
to vampires either.

12:24.750 --> 12:28.500
And he's got his soldier-monks.
Strength, after all, in numbers.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.333
You're right.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.708
I am?

12:31.791 --> 12:33.458
We propose a temporary alliance.

12:33.541 --> 12:36.833
They help us see what's happening,
and then they help us fight.

12:36.916 --> 12:40.541
What, now? I thought you might want
to argue me to death about it.

12:41.583 --> 12:44.208
Maybe don't tell him
about the magic birds, though.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.916
[Maria] He knows you kill vampires.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.916
I have a reputation.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.250
And people accept it,
because of the heroic and handsome thing.

12:51.333 --> 12:54.083
But teenage girls
conjuring creatures from the Otherworld?

12:54.166 --> 12:57.541
They start building
piles of very flammable wood.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.791
You talk like I don't know
when to keep my mouth shut.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.916
Hi, Mizrak. We need to speak to the Abbot.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.000
Think he's praying.

13:29.083 --> 13:32.750
I'm sure if you want to pray with him,
he won't mind.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.333
We're not here to pray.

13:36.875 --> 13:40.458
We killed three vampires tonight,
out in the woods near the château,

13:41.083 --> 13:44.875
and one of them said something
about a Vampire Messiah.

14:01.625 --> 14:04.791
They say they have urgent business
about vampires.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.416
Time was, there were hardly any.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.125
Last couple of years,
I'd kill one every few months or so.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.916
For which Machecoul is forever grateful.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.708
But this was three in one night.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.666
Three in one night.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.416
So, something's up. Something big.

14:22.958 --> 14:26.458
Before it died, one of them warned me,
which was nice of it,

14:26.541 --> 14:28.750
that a Vampire Messiah is on its way.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.791
The Devourer of Light, apparently.

14:32.375 --> 14:33.333
[chuckles]

14:33.416 --> 14:35.958
Devourer of Light.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.250
Which might explain why the vampires
are congregating at the château.

14:39.333 --> 14:41.750
[Abbot] Vampires? At the château?

14:41.833 --> 14:43.083
Where else would they go?

14:43.916 --> 14:46.833
[Abbot] The Marquis
is a pillar of this community,

14:47.375 --> 14:49.958
like his family before him
for generations.

14:50.625 --> 14:51.791
For centuries.

14:51.875 --> 14:56.166
I can't believe
he would welcome vampires into his home.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.958
He's not a pillar of this community.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.416
Before the Revolution,
he spent all his time at court

15:00.500 --> 15:02.916
and probably forgot we existed,
even though his wealth

15:03.000 --> 15:06.458
is thanks to the pain and suffering
of every peasant within 40 miles.

15:07.541 --> 15:08.625
[Abbot] Oh, Maria.

15:09.291 --> 15:15.583
It breaks my heart to hear you like this,
parroting the phrases of the Godless mob.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.666
-The Godless--?
-No good will come of all this hatred.

15:19.166 --> 15:22.041
Hatred and envy and division.

15:22.541 --> 15:25.958
It will only lead to bloodshed
and greater suffering.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.583
But I pray for you.

15:28.416 --> 15:30.416
And for you, Richter Belmont.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.166
I know how much pain is in your soul.

15:34.666 --> 15:37.291
How much sadness and loss.

15:37.791 --> 15:39.791
That's good of you, really, but--

15:39.875 --> 15:41.666
We-- We appreciate it, the praying.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.333
But we think vampires
are gathering at the château,

15:44.416 --> 15:45.875
and maybe this is the reason.

15:46.458 --> 15:49.375
We can go and look for ourselves,
see if it is just innocent nobles,

15:49.458 --> 15:51.833
with their teeth stained
by nothing worse than vintage claret,

15:51.916 --> 15:53.375
but we could use some help.

15:57.208 --> 15:59.875
All right. I'll see what I can find out.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.125
I have my spies.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.458
Don't do anything rash.

16:05.458 --> 16:09.000
The Marquis won't thank us
for besmirching his good name,

16:09.750 --> 16:11.208
but, of course,

16:11.291 --> 16:14.416
if he has thrown his doors open
to the undead,

16:14.500 --> 16:17.375
we can go together
and burn them all to dust.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.583
Whatever our differences, Maria,

16:21.208 --> 16:24.125
we have a common enemy in evil.

16:26.041 --> 16:30.500
Though evil can be more subtle
than is often supposed.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.250
Thank you.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.500
"I have my spies."

16:44.000 --> 16:46.541
Ooh, spies. Spies everywhere.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.458
They are everywhere, Richter.
The whole town.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.041
It's why we go to the woods.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.708
We did the right thing, though.
Speaking to him.

16:54.791 --> 16:56.500
And you were good as gold.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.833
Definitely know
when to keep your mouth shut.

16:58.916 --> 17:01.291
Well, there's only so much
pious bullshit I can stand.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.791
Maybe you should practice.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.416
[indistinct conversations
and music playing]

17:06.375 --> 17:07.916
-Go for a drink, if you want.
-[sighs]

17:08.000 --> 17:10.458
We promised your mother we'd come home.

17:10.541 --> 17:13.416
-So, we go home.
-In other words, you're hungry.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.416
[Richter] She's cooking dinner.
How rude do you think I am?

[playing pensive, classical music]

18:15.958 --> 18:20.166
[Marquis] Every single day,
every moment in Versailles,

18:20.250 --> 18:24.250
there was something exciting,
entertaining to do…

18:24.833 --> 18:25.875
[sighs]

18:25.958 --> 18:29.291
-…but here, even the peasants--
-[footsteps approaching]

18:34.333 --> 18:40.666
What is it about you peasants out here
that makes everything, even your blood,

18:40.750 --> 18:42.750
so unremittingly dull?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.416

19:38.041 --> 19:39.083
[music fades]

19:39.166 --> 19:41.666
[Maria] People don't need me
to tell them their lives are tough.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.333
But they're suspicious of the Revolution.

19:45.416 --> 19:49.250
They get told lies about everything
by people they think they can trust.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.208
The Abbot's a good man, Maria.
And what he says, it's not lies.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.125
Not to him.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.416
You said it yourself, people trust him.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.083
[Julia] I'm sorry, Richter.

20:03.708 --> 20:06.125
-…believed the Church for centuries.
-I'm so sorry.

20:06.208 --> 20:07.791
[disorienting music playing]

20:07.875 --> 20:11.333
[Maria in a distant voice] The world
is changing. Even here in Machecoul.

20:11.916 --> 20:13.291
The world is changing.

20:13.916 --> 20:16.291
Tonight, for instance.
Before the vampire attack,

20:16.375 --> 20:17.708
people were really listening.

20:17.791 --> 20:19.125
Weren't they, Richter?

20:20.875 --> 20:22.208
[gasps] What?

20:22.291 --> 20:24.750
-[panting]
-People were really listening tonight.

20:29.416 --> 20:31.208
[chuckles] Well, I wasn't.

20:31.291 --> 20:34.875
Why do you kill vampires, then?
If you're so uninterested.

20:34.958 --> 20:37.375
[Richter] It's the most fun
you can have with your clothes on.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.208
He's a Belmont. Bless him.

20:41.416 --> 20:42.666
He has a destiny.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.750
[chuckles] I don't believe in destiny.

20:44.833 --> 20:48.333
You don't believe in anything.
It's because they're evil, Richter.

20:48.416 --> 20:52.125
Vampires? Evil? Oh, my God. Are you sure?

20:52.708 --> 20:54.625
And evil has to be fought.

20:58.166 --> 20:59.458
I believe in you and your mother.

20:59.541 --> 21:00.625
[gentle music playing]

21:01.208 --> 21:05.041
I believe you're the kindest,
most courageous people in the world.

21:05.791 --> 21:08.833
So, I don't need to understand
the things you believe in,

21:08.916 --> 21:11.416
and I certainly
don't need to believe in them too.

21:12.708 --> 21:14.375
I just need to stand by you.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.291
Always.

21:19.916 --> 21:21.333
[scoffs] You're such a dick.

-No.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.958
Well, whatever they are,

21:44.041 --> 21:45.958
I'm sure they can die.

I don't know what they were.
I've never seen anything like them.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.916
They were night creatures.

Demons made from human corpses
grafted onto souls from hell.

23:43.791 --> 23:45.750
Nobody's made any for centuries.

Who are you?

23:47.541 --> 23:50.083
Obviously you're a witch,
but where did you come from?

23:50.583 --> 23:53.333
Whoever you are… thank you.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.083
[woman] They don't just happen.
Someone has to make them.

23:57.166 --> 23:59.333
[Richter] What are you talking about?
Who are you?

23:59.416 --> 24:00.958
[woman] And that would take a Forgemaster.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.916
A sorcerer, magician, necromancer.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.875
Of great, great power.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.291
There must be a Forgemaster around here.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.333
Can you answer my questions?

24:12.250 --> 24:13.666
My name is Annette.

24:13.750 --> 24:14.750
And I am Edouard.

24:15.333 --> 24:18.750
We're from the island of Saint-Domingue,
in the Caribbean Sea.

24:21.541 --> 24:24.041
Across the ocean?

24:24.125 --> 24:26.000
We're looking for someone called Belmont.

24:26.083 --> 24:28.541
That would be the ungrateful wanker.

24:33.125 --> 24:36.541
I don't suppose you know anything
about a Vampire Messiah?

24:37.208 --> 24:38.416
Yes.

Still…

25:20.458 --> 25:22.333
you can tell your Messiah…
