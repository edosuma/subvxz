WEBVTT

01:12.322 --> 01:13.323
Forgive me.

01:16.952 --> 01:21.123
Forgive me for sinning
with Samuel Dowsett.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.294
It was the serpent who tempted me.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.382
Our secret, Naomi.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.854
Morning, Doctor.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.731
How's the patient? Anything I should know?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.774
Just do what he says.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.449
Mrs. Seaborne. I came as soon as I could.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.915
"Remember me when I am gone away,

04:09.249 --> 04:12.211
Gone far away into the silent land

04:13.086 --> 04:14.922
When you can no more hold me by the hand."

04:15.005 --> 04:17.548
Sir, may I examine you?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.185
It's progressing.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.272
But if I operate immediately,
it's a very simple procedure.

04:35.067 --> 04:39.655
I intend to leave the world
as I entered it.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.865
Unscarred.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.966
If I don't operate, he will die.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.551
His throat is constricted.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.013
With your consent,
I could give him a strong sedative.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.892
What-- Operate without his permission?

05:14.773 --> 05:15.858
I'm so sorry.

05:26.577 --> 05:27.995
Can I stay with you?

05:28.579 --> 05:29.913
Of course you can.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.918
You need to rest, Cora.

05:46.722 --> 05:47.764
You're trembling.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.771
Frankie.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.693
Your father's died.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.492
Are you sad?

06:52.538 --> 06:53.664
But you're not crying.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.296
I'm so sorry, Frankie.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.907
Dear Cora, I'm so sorry.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.035
Let me know if I can do anything.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.120
I will. Thank you, Charles.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.377
-Thank you for coming, Dr. Garrett.
-I'm afraid I'm empty-handed.

08:26.757 --> 08:27.758
We should go.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.843
I'll get you a cab.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.346
I don't want to go in a cab.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.056
Shall we walk?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.140
I want to go on the Underground.

08:37.726 --> 08:38.852
Shall I take him home?

08:40.562 --> 08:41.563
Come.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.495
What I'd really like is to go
for a very long walk.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.622
Will you come with me?

08:59.331 --> 09:00.332
Of course.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.301
You know,
we're following the course of the river.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.345
It's right beneath our feet.

09:15.013 --> 09:19.059
The eels used to swim
upstream all the way from Sargasso Sea.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.854
They'd come here to breed.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.441
Now instead of mud and reeds,
all they find is iron and concrete.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.653
Nothing wrong with iron and concrete.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.323
What?

09:35.826 --> 09:38.078
Natural history is my passion,
Dr. Garrett.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.206
Listen. You can hear the river.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.986
My husband was always buying me jewelry.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.614
I wish you'd let me operate.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.206
How does it feel
to cut into a living body?

10:26.001 --> 10:28.629
No, I'm curious. That's all.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.344
It's exciting.

10:36.678 --> 10:37.679
Terrifying.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.307
Every operation, a leap of faith.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.976
It's a high-wire act, Mrs. Seaborne.

10:45.729 --> 10:49.483
It sounds fascinating.
I'd love to learn more about it.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.776
How are you feeling?

10:51.527 --> 10:52.528
Odd.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.822
All of Michael's friends…

11:00.536 --> 11:03.038
I went for a walk with Dr. Garrett.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.375
We talked and talked.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.755
Was that wrong?

11:12.256 --> 11:13.340
No.

11:14.216 --> 11:18.303
You're free now, Cora,
to make new friends, explore.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.267
We've been shut away for too long.

11:28.564 --> 11:31.400
I saved you this.
Thought you might be interested.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.078
I'll check on Frankie.

12:12.608 --> 12:13.734
Gracie!

12:20.407 --> 12:21.408
Gracie!

12:30.083 --> 12:31.376
Gracie!

12:42.638 --> 12:45.516
…you showed such keen interest in my work

12:45.599 --> 12:49.937
that I wonder if you'd like to watch me
operate at the medical school?

12:55.651 --> 12:59.530
The patient was trampled by a horse.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.365
-Madam.
-Excuse us.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.659
-There'll be a lot of blood.
-…with a compound fracture

13:03.742 --> 13:05.285
of the tibia.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.330
-Luke Garrett will be operating.
-Yeah!

13:10.249 --> 13:12.793
Silence! Silence!

13:12.876 --> 13:17.798
Luke Garrett will be operating,
assisted by George Spencer.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.091
Yeah!

13:20.425 --> 13:21.760
That's my boy.

13:25.264 --> 13:26.265
Come on now.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.476
Oh, God.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.314
-I'd rather bleed to death in the street.
-Scalpel.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.575
I can't see.

13:49.913 --> 13:53.292
Here we are. My rooms are upstairs.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.921
I expect you've never been
south of the river before?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.965
I'm very happy to be here, Dr. Garrett.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.224
Do you always assist, Dr. Spencer?

14:09.308 --> 14:11.101
Well, of course I do operate.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.146
An ingrown toenail or bladder stone.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.481
I do a perfectly good lithotomy.

14:17.691 --> 14:21.361
But Mr. Garrett is at the cutting edge,
Mrs. Seaborne.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.447
Please, call me Cora.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.532
Luke.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.995
So what edge do you hope
to cut into next, Luke?

14:30.078 --> 14:31.038
The heart.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.165
How?

14:33.248 --> 14:37.794
Well, the main challenge
is keeping the patient alive

14:37.878 --> 14:40.464
once I open the chest cavity.

14:41.632 --> 14:45.052
Just need the right patient.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.304
You're an animal.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.890
The hospital board agree with you.
No idea why.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.017
We can all be skeptical about new ideas.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.645
-Oh, no. I'm all for progress.
-Martha's a socialist.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.856
A socialist and a naturalist?

14:58.607 --> 15:01.443
-And what of it?
-Nothing. It's delightful.

15:01.527 --> 15:02.528
It's delightful?

15:03.153 --> 15:05.405
Is your heart surgery delightful?

15:05.489 --> 15:06.740
More of a vocation.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.495
Well, if we were welcomed into the
professions, we might have vocations too.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.622
Well, perhaps we were not welcomed either.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.419
We must all follow our passions.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.088
I couldn't agree more.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.112
What is it?

16:27.946 --> 16:28.947
Nothing.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.951
You said she went off to Maldon.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.663
So she'll be in Maldon?

16:38.582 --> 16:40.918
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

16:41.502 --> 16:42.503
No.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.805
If she's been with that boy, tell me.

16:54.515 --> 16:55.516
She hasn't.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.188
Then she'll be home soon.

17:13.534 --> 17:14.952
Is Mrs. Seaborne in?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.203
Yes, come in.

17:16.787 --> 17:17.871
Thank you.

17:17.954 --> 17:18.955
Cora?

17:22.792 --> 17:23.627
Luke.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.463
Hello. What a surprise.

17:26.547 --> 17:27.798
Brought you something.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.844
Wow, it's beautiful.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.597
-What is it?
-A slice of human heart.

17:35.681 --> 17:36.890
From the operating theater?

17:36.974 --> 17:41.019
No, no. I got it from the mortuary.
Research cadaver.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.022
It's the oddest present
I've ever received.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.357
Thank you.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.026
I'll take it to Essex. We leave tomorrow.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.239
-Essex?
-Yes, Colchester.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.495
A sea creature's been spotted.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.622
That. I read about that.

18:01.373 --> 18:02.958
I've done some research.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.669
-Into a mythical beast?
-Not mythical. Real.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.464
I think this serpent could be
some sort of plesiosaur.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.801
As Darwin says in The Origin,
there may well be species

18:12.885 --> 18:14.970
that have been insulated
from the usual competitive pressures.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.638
-I mean, surely, you've come across--
-No.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.932
-You haven't?
-Cora, no--

18:19.016 --> 18:20.017
-What?
-Don't--

18:21.059 --> 18:22.936
Essex. Don't go.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.983
I thought I should follow my passions.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.067
Yes, of course.

18:29.151 --> 18:32.946
But from a medical point of view,
you're grieving.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.781
-Cora--
-I can do what I want now he's dead.

18:43.999 --> 18:50.172
News from Essex!
All the latest. Monstrous serpent returns!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.310
Look, it's not so bad.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.230
It's witch-burning country.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.981
News from Essex!

19:08.065 --> 19:09.775
All the latest.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.277
Monstrous serpent returns.

19:12.361 --> 19:13.695
What can you tell me about the serpent?

19:13.779 --> 19:16.657
What can't I tell you, madam?
Have a look at that. Postcard?

19:16.740 --> 19:17.741
No, thank you.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.743
-You here looking for the serpent?
-Have you seen it?

19:19.826 --> 19:22.287
Oh, yeah. Huge ridged back, wings.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.665
-Serpents don't have wings.
-This one does.

19:24.748 --> 19:25.791
Are there any photographs?

19:25.874 --> 19:30.003
Well, livestock's been eaten.
And there's been a sighting recently.

19:30.087 --> 19:32.089
-Where?
-Aldwinter. Village out on the Blackwater.

19:32.965 --> 19:35.217
Aldwinter. Thank you.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.426
Thank you.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.596
News from Essex!

19:46.103 --> 19:49.022
Do you mind if I keep walking?
I'll find you some treasure.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.446
Don't be too late.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.639
Damn you!

20:32.316 --> 20:33.734
-Damn you!
-Stop!

20:40.741 --> 20:42.034
Let me help.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.118
Go on, then.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.625
She's stuck.

20:52.753 --> 20:53.795
Get up! Up!

20:58.759 --> 20:59.760
Here, take my belt.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.106
Watch its neck. Watch its neck.

21:15.567 --> 21:16.568
Now!

21:32.167 --> 21:33.293
Here.

21:41.260 --> 21:42.469
Thank you.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.684
-I should go.
-Where you headed?

21:48.767 --> 21:49.893
Aldwinter.

21:50.978 --> 21:53.730
You've heard the stories.
You wanna go and have a look.

21:55.941 --> 21:58.569
There's nothing to see. Go home.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.352
Take our sacrifice.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.064
Bring my sister home.

22:43.113 --> 22:46.450
Take this. Bring Gracie back.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.910
Bring Gracie back.

23:12.476 --> 23:13.477
Henry?

23:14.937 --> 23:15.938
Father.

23:19.149 --> 23:20.275
Any news on Gracie?

23:24.905 --> 23:25.989
You all right?

23:26.615 --> 23:30.577
It's nothing. It was an accident. Gracie?

23:30.661 --> 23:34.915
She went off to Maldon to sell lace.
She's never been gone this long before.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.417
What does Naomi think?

23:37.960 --> 23:40.629
She's been listening to the rumors
about the serpent.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.631
Now you know as well as I do, it's a myth.

23:43.340 --> 23:46.844
I reckon she stayed on in Maldon
with a friend.

23:48.178 --> 23:51.265
She's a lively soul.
No mother's eye on her.

23:53.976 --> 23:55.185
I'm here if you need me.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.609
I found these in the trap this morning.

24:04.987 --> 24:05.988
Thank you.

24:08.991 --> 24:10.367
She'll be back soon, Henry.

24:11.952 --> 24:14.037
And I'll see you all in church on Sunday.

24:15.956 --> 24:16.957
Thank you, Father.

25:03.045 --> 25:04.338
Did you read my letter?

25:04.421 --> 25:05.589
As I keep telling you,

25:05.672 --> 25:08.926
if I was to take on the problems
of every family in my constituency,

25:09.009 --> 25:10.636
I'd never get any work done.

25:13.931 --> 25:15.432
Who is this?

25:15.516 --> 25:16.600
Charles. What are you doing here?

25:16.683 --> 25:19.853
I heard you'd left London.
I was worried about you.

25:19.937 --> 25:21.813
I'm here to research the sea dragon.

25:21.897 --> 25:23.690
Couldn't you have found a hobby in town?

25:23.774 --> 25:26.318
Helped Martha with her campaigns?

25:28.820 --> 25:31.448
-I promised Michael I'd look after you.
-Well, Martha looks after me.

25:34.284 --> 25:38.747
Will Ransome. We offered him a safe seat.
Lost him to God.

25:39.665 --> 25:42.501
He's got a parish near the coast.
He could keep an eye on you.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.919
What, a vicar?

25:45.087 --> 25:48.841
I'll write to them.
Introduce you. He lives in Aldwinter.

25:48.924 --> 25:50.300
Aldwinter?

25:59.059 --> 26:00.978
"I have been digging down by the estuary

26:01.061 --> 26:03.021
but no evidence of the plesiosaur yet…"

26:03.105 --> 26:04.439
Very romantic.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.984
"However, the countryside is beautiful,

26:07.067 --> 26:10.654
and the pub is charming.
I still have your heart.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.781
Yours sincerely, Cora."

26:15.117 --> 26:16.827
Spencer. What does that mean?

26:18.203 --> 26:19.663
She still has your present?

26:22.040 --> 26:25.961
No, I think she likes me.
She does, doesn't she?

26:27.880 --> 26:30.340
Mr. Garrett. You said I should
come and find you.

26:30.424 --> 26:31.508
I think we finally have the right case.

26:31.592 --> 26:33.385
-A pericardial effusion.
-I think so.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.679
-Age?
-Fifty-one. Her heart rate is dropping.

26:35.762 --> 26:36.763
Just be quick.

26:40.142 --> 26:42.269
I suppose I'll see to
your next appointment then?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.071
Hold the lung for me, Nurse.

26:53.947 --> 26:54.948
Scissors.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.664
Hold that.

27:10.422 --> 27:11.632
Check the pulse.

27:16.512 --> 27:17.513
Nothing.

27:18.764 --> 27:19.765
Adrenaline.

27:35.322 --> 27:36.365
Anything?

27:56.301 --> 27:57.302
I'm sorry.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.516
Another dead body in my theater.

28:02.599 --> 28:05.727
She had a couple of hours in her at best.
Anyone could see that.

28:05.811 --> 28:09.314
You're a pioneer, Garrett,
and I admire that.

28:09.398 --> 28:12.276
But I have to think about our reputation.

28:12.359 --> 28:16.738
I mean, here I am, attempting
the first heart operation ever!

28:17.281 --> 28:20.367
Our reputation?
It wouldn't suffer, it would soar.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.536
Doesn't he realize I am one of the-- No.

28:22.619 --> 28:25.122
In fact, I am without a shadow of a doubt,

28:25.205 --> 28:28.584
the most innovative surgeon…

28:29.793 --> 28:31.336
of my generation.

28:35.674 --> 28:38.719
-What if someone else gets there first?
-Is anyone else trying?

28:38.802 --> 28:40.554
Her body couldn't take the shock
of the knife.

28:40.637 --> 28:42.181
What I need is a strong heart.

28:42.264 --> 28:45.184
Young and healthy.
I would do it in this room if I have to.

28:50.189 --> 28:54.067
Let's take a few days off. Go away?

28:58.947 --> 29:00.157
To Essex.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.007
Come in.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.468
What is going on?

29:19.551 --> 29:21.720
Have we come to the lunatic asylum?

29:21.803 --> 29:23.263
Luke. What are you doing here?

29:23.347 --> 29:25.182
You made Essex sound so enticing.

29:25.265 --> 29:28.936
Well, it's very good to see you.
Come in. Come in.

29:29.019 --> 29:30.354
You remember Luke, Frankie?

29:34.066 --> 29:35.484
375.

29:35.567 --> 29:38.237
374. 373.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.405
Don't you brush your hair anymore?

29:40.489 --> 29:42.866
Your hands are filthy.

29:43.951 --> 29:46.620
-Good afternoon, Dr. Garrett.
-Luke.

29:46.703 --> 29:48.205
I'll sort your cases out.

29:50.290 --> 29:53.710
-Spencer.
-Do you need a hand?

29:54.962 --> 29:56.755
Of course she does. Go on.

30:03.095 --> 30:06.598
So, what are you really doing here?

30:11.728 --> 30:14.439
I lost a patient on the table.

30:14.982 --> 30:15.816
I'm sorry.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.235
Ah, it happens
when trying a new procedure.

30:19.528 --> 30:21.488
What about you? Any sign of the beast?

30:22.823 --> 30:25.033
Not yet. But I'm going to Aldwinter

30:25.117 --> 30:26.159
-to find out more.
-Who from?

30:26.702 --> 30:28.579
God knows. Some boring vicar.

30:28.662 --> 30:30.247
-How awful.
-I know.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.623
He'll make you say grace.

30:31.707 --> 30:34.918
I'll refuse, and it'll be painful.

30:35.002 --> 30:38.714
-Well, you should just stay here with me.
-Should I?

30:38.797 --> 30:41.383
Well, it would be rude to leave me alone
on my first night.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.719
You've got Spencer.

30:44.553 --> 30:47.347
But if the beast is calling you…

30:48.515 --> 30:50.392
Well, I'll be back after dinner.

31:02.696 --> 31:04.406
Is there something out there?

31:07.075 --> 31:08.535
No, just the wind.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.375
Come on. Let's go and join the others.

31:15.459 --> 31:16.460
Come on, pup.

31:21.882 --> 31:25.802
Now, who has a pencil for Naomi?

31:27.387 --> 31:29.640
-What are you drawing, John?
-The serpent.

31:30.307 --> 31:33.393
-Shall we talk about something else?
-Yes. Let's.

31:33.477 --> 31:34.728
Who's coming to dinner?

31:35.938 --> 31:40.108
A friend of Charles. A widow and her son,
all the way from London.

31:40.609 --> 31:43.904
She'll be old and wrinkled.
And she'll bore us all

31:43.987 --> 31:46.740
with the latest talk
from society drawing rooms.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.326
And her son?

31:49.910 --> 31:51.578
What do you think, Jo?

31:51.662 --> 31:52.913
A young student?

31:52.996 --> 31:54.122
Down from Oxford?

31:54.915 --> 31:58.752
Yes. He'll fall in love with me
and then propose.

31:58.836 --> 32:01.588
And I will refuse and break his heart.

32:04.132 --> 32:06.093
Will you stay? Join us for dinner.

32:06.176 --> 32:08.512
Please do. You'd be very welcome.

32:11.014 --> 32:14.726
No, thank you.
I should go before it gets dark.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.854
I don't want my father to worry
about me too.

32:18.438 --> 32:19.565
I'll walk you home.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.442
-But you've got visitors.
-It's fine.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.695
They'll still be here when I get back.

32:35.539 --> 32:38.458
Can I ask you a question about
the Scriptures, Father?

32:39.418 --> 32:40.419
Of course.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.425
Why does the serpent tempt Eve?

32:55.058 --> 32:56.852
Well, it's an allegory.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.607
The serpent is really the devil.

33:06.612 --> 33:07.863
That's what I thought.

33:11.575 --> 33:13.660
There is no serpent in Essex.

33:26.131 --> 33:30.969
I promise you, Naomi.
There's nothing here.

33:53.659 --> 33:55.202
-Thank you.
-Of course.

34:04.127 --> 34:05.170
Henry, what's this?

34:05.879 --> 34:09.882
Naomi skinned them this afternoon.
To scare the beast away.

34:12.177 --> 34:16.348
It isn't real, Henry.
You have to tell her. There is no beast.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.804
Protect us. Keep us safe.

35:10.110 --> 35:13.697
You're too young to be a widow.
And so beautiful.

35:14.281 --> 35:17.117
Well. I feel a little overdressed.

35:17.201 --> 35:19.953
I expected dinner at the vicarage
to be more formal.

35:20.037 --> 35:22.497
Have you got Mr. Burns, the butcher?

35:22.581 --> 35:23.582
Not at home.

35:25.876 --> 35:30.172
We're so sorry. For him to lose his father
at such a young age.

35:31.256 --> 35:34.843
Actually, he's always been
a bit different. He's…

35:36.261 --> 35:39.223
His own person. That's all right.

35:42.976 --> 35:47.397
Will should be back in a minute.
He's walking home one of Jo's friends.

35:47.481 --> 35:49.066
Everyone's a little on edge at the moment.

35:51.568 --> 35:52.653
There he is.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.114
Yes, I have…

35:58.909 --> 36:04.248
I need to work on my sermon.
Try and calm everyone down.

36:04.331 --> 36:07.042
-Can I just join you later?
-Absolutely not.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.547
And they're nice.

36:22.975 --> 36:23.976
Hello.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.394
You're the vicar?

36:26.687 --> 36:29.022
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Seaborne.

36:32.776 --> 36:35.070
John, do you remember the day
I cut my face?

36:35.153 --> 36:37.948
She's the strange lady from the marshes.

36:39.533 --> 36:41.535
I'm sorry. I was rude.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.453
I don't know what I would have done
without you.

36:43.537 --> 36:44.997
You were a monster.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.915
I'm sure I was.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.417
-Hello.
-Martha.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.128
-Martha. Will. Pleased to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

36:52.421 --> 36:55.090
I'm hungry. Could we eat?

36:56.133 --> 36:57.551
What a good idea.

37:00.304 --> 37:01.972
So you're here to look for fossils?

37:02.055 --> 37:04.183
Cora is obsessed with the serpent.

37:05.851 --> 37:09.313
Well, the only serpent here
is on a pew in church.

37:09.396 --> 37:10.647
It's been there for 200 years.

37:10.731 --> 37:13.400
-And now it's come back to life.
-Jo.

37:14.151 --> 37:15.277
Why do you think that?

37:15.360 --> 37:20.991
Because it's been seen on the marshes.
And now lots of people think the--

37:21.074 --> 37:23.202
Jo. That's enough.

37:24.953 --> 37:26.788
The serpent is not real.

37:29.291 --> 37:30.667
But what if it is?

37:31.835 --> 37:33.837
Do you know the work of Charles Lyell?

37:35.214 --> 37:36.465
Yes, of course.

37:36.548 --> 37:38.050
Will reads everything.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.510
Who's Charles Lyell?

37:40.093 --> 37:42.429
He wrote about animals
that escaped evolution.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.515
Perhaps your serpent's one of them.

37:45.182 --> 37:46.391
No.

37:46.475 --> 37:48.727
No, the serpent is an invention.

37:48.810 --> 37:52.648
It's a symptom of the times we live in.

37:52.731 --> 37:54.274
Well-- Exciting times.

37:54.358 --> 37:58.028
Of great change
that bring real fears with them.

37:59.530 --> 38:01.323
So you're against progress?

38:03.242 --> 38:05.953
You're determined to see me
in a very narrow light.

38:09.248 --> 38:11.124
Maybe I fear your judgment.

38:12.209 --> 38:15.838
Perhaps I'm an outcast…
At least in the eyes of your church.

38:17.798 --> 38:18.882
Jesus was an outcast.

38:19.925 --> 38:21.051
Once upon a time.

38:21.134 --> 38:23.011
But these days, he's very establishment.

38:25.013 --> 38:26.014
True.

38:27.724 --> 38:30.477
I'd rather believe in a creature people
have actually seen

38:30.561 --> 38:32.604
than an invisible god.

38:33.522 --> 38:34.565
Is that blasphemy?

38:35.858 --> 38:37.526
You won't get Will to judge you.

38:37.609 --> 38:38.861
No matter how hard you try.

38:40.112 --> 38:42.823
But speak to my curate.
He'd happily condemn you to hellfire.

38:45.826 --> 38:49.121
-Well, none of you are as I expected.
-Likewise.

38:49.204 --> 38:50.956
Father said you were going to bore--

38:51.039 --> 38:54.459
If you could stay the night, you could
see the pew at church in the morning.

38:55.711 --> 39:00.048
Well, I should get back to my friend,
but I'd love to see the serpent.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.467
Yes, please.

39:02.551 --> 39:06.597
But I hate church. You stay. We go.

39:07.222 --> 39:09.308
We'll head back tonight then, shall we?

39:10.976 --> 39:12.269
Please do whatever you want.

39:14.188 --> 39:15.397
You'll stay?

39:16.607 --> 39:17.858
That's settled then.

39:26.575 --> 39:28.243
Henry! Henry!

39:38.253 --> 39:40.756
-What is it?
-I just got back from Maldon.

39:40.839 --> 39:41.882
Gracie?

39:43.759 --> 39:44.927
She never turned up.

39:48.889 --> 39:50.641
Stay here, where you're safe.

40:01.985 --> 40:03.111
Gracie?

40:05.614 --> 40:06.907
Gracie!

40:07.533 --> 40:08.534
Gracie!

41:14.766 --> 41:15.767
Father!

41:36.705 --> 41:40.417
The Essex serpent
here in the heart of your church.

41:41.502 --> 41:44.087
A myth carved in oak.

41:45.255 --> 41:48.217
I saw a bloodied sheep's head
on the marshes this morning.

41:48.759 --> 41:49.968
Killed by the creature?

41:50.552 --> 41:53.639
Carrion for an eel trap.
One of the fishermen must have dropped it.

41:54.348 --> 41:56.141
How can you be so sure?

41:58.352 --> 42:02.648
If I were to let in any doubt,
how would I look after my flock?

42:04.441 --> 42:06.485
-Philip. Good morning.
-Good morning, Father.

42:08.403 --> 42:10.280
-Morning, Edward.
-Morning, Father.

42:10.906 --> 42:12.658
George. Morning.

42:14.535 --> 42:19.164
You know Gracie Banks is still missing.
So… Well, what will you say now?

42:21.542 --> 42:24.336
This is my curate, Matthew Evansford.

42:24.419 --> 42:25.838
This is Mrs. Cora Seaborne.

42:25.921 --> 42:26.922
Pleased to meet you.

42:27.005 --> 42:29.007
Father Ransome needs to get ready.

42:29.091 --> 42:30.467
Take a seat, Mrs. Seaborne.

42:31.635 --> 42:33.053
Not in that pew.

42:33.971 --> 42:35.013
Not today.

42:41.687 --> 42:45.190
I'm sorry. He's taken all this to heart.

42:45.274 --> 42:46.733
Sit wherever you like.

43:51.006 --> 43:53.342
Go and get help. Go!

43:56.970 --> 43:57.971
Gracie!

43:59.598 --> 44:00.599
Gracie!

44:02.476 --> 44:04.853
Every one of us lives with doubt and fear.

44:06.438 --> 44:07.481
Even me.

44:09.942 --> 44:11.818
That is where God lives.

44:13.570 --> 44:18.450
In our uncertainty and in love.

44:20.536 --> 44:23.205
And now is the time for us
to come together.

44:24.665 --> 44:26.625
For my part, I will listen to your fears,

44:26.708 --> 44:29.503
and I'll try my hardest
to understand them.

44:30.963 --> 44:32.256
Don't be scared.

44:34.800 --> 44:39.972
It's when we're most lost
that the source of light is closest.

44:44.351 --> 44:45.352
Please stand.

44:52.901 --> 44:57.364
Abide with me

44:57.447 --> 45:04.079
Fast falls the eventide

45:04.913 --> 45:09.710
The darkness deepens

45:10.878 --> 45:15.591
Lord, with me abide

45:15.674 --> 45:22.514
When other helpers fail

45:22.598 --> 45:26.018
And comforts flee

45:27.477 --> 45:31.690
Help of the helpless

45:31.773 --> 45:37.446
Oh, abide with me

45:41.283 --> 45:43.410
I fear no foe…

45:48.415 --> 45:50.584
Jonah. What is it?

45:52.836 --> 45:54.004
It's Gracie.

45:54.546 --> 45:56.048
Henry sent me. He needs help.

45:56.673 --> 45:57.674
Gracie.

46:02.554 --> 46:06.350
Gracie! Gracie! Gracie!

46:06.433 --> 46:10.312
-Keep moving, come on!
-Gracie! Gracie! Gracie!

46:10.395 --> 46:11.939
Gracie!

46:12.564 --> 46:13.941
-Gracie!
-Go on.

46:14.024 --> 46:16.360
Gracie!

46:16.443 --> 46:17.819
-Gracie!
-Come here.

46:19.112 --> 46:20.489
Gracie!

46:21.698 --> 46:26.537
-Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie!
-Come on, keep up!

46:27.412 --> 46:30.874
Gracie! Gracie!

46:34.086 --> 46:38.966
Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie!

46:50.894 --> 46:53.397
No! No!

46:57.776 --> 46:58.861
No.

47:06.827 --> 47:08.078
Gracie.

47:14.835 --> 47:17.087
No. No. No. No.

47:22.134 --> 47:24.511
No. No.

47:24.595 --> 47:28.473
Here! Here! She's over here!

47:33.437 --> 47:34.938
Will! Will!

47:36.190 --> 47:38.025
This way! This way!

47:49.953 --> 47:51.079
My Gracie.

47:59.213 --> 48:00.672
I'm so sorry.

48:00.756 --> 48:02.966
The devil. The devil has come.

48:05.260 --> 48:07.262
Not now. Please, Matthew.

48:08.180 --> 48:11.266
"Holy Michael, the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

48:11.808 --> 48:14.561
Be our safeguard against the wickedness
and snares of the devil.

48:15.646 --> 48:18.774
By the power of God,
thrust into hell Satan

48:18.857 --> 48:20.567
and all evil spirits who wander…"

48:20.651 --> 48:23.403
Matthew's right. The serpent has come.

48:24.488 --> 48:27.366
"Come to the assistance of men
whom God has created

48:27.449 --> 48:31.537
to His likeness and whom He has redeemed
at a great price

48:31.620 --> 48:33.413
from the tyranny of the devil.

48:34.289 --> 48:35.916
Pray therefore the God of Peace

48:35.999 --> 48:40.838
to crush Satan beneath our feet,
that he may no longer retain men captive

48:40.921 --> 48:42.381
and do injury to the Church.

48:43.131 --> 48:45.300
Offer our prayers to the Most High,

48:45.384 --> 48:48.470
that without delay
they may draw His mercy down upon us,

48:48.554 --> 48:52.850
take hold of the dragon, the old serpent,
which is the devil and Satan…"
