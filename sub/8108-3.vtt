WEBVTT

00:24.984 --> 00:28.530
I still can't believe
you talked me into this.

00:28.655 --> 00:30.949
(CHUCKLING) Come on, honey,
you're gonna throw him off.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.451
It's okay,
I'm almost done.

00:34.619 --> 00:35.704
(SIGHS)

00:35.829 --> 00:38.081
A little more light
on your hips.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.165
God.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.793
Why couldn't you have come up with this
before I had two kids?

00:41.918 --> 00:44.921
(CHUCKLING)
You look amazing.

00:46.673 --> 00:51.553
Okay, I think... Yeah, I'm done.
Want to come take a look?

00:52.679 --> 00:53.972
(CHUCKLES)

00:58.309 --> 00:59.561
(SIGHS) I can't.

00:59.686 --> 01:00.854
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:00.979 --> 01:02.021
You first.

01:02.147 --> 01:03.690
No, we'll look together.

01:11.614 --> 01:13.658
I don't understand.
I thought...

01:13.783 --> 01:14.743
What the hell is that?

01:14.868 --> 01:16.077
Honey, it's okay.

01:16.202 --> 01:18.121
This is not what we discussed,
or what I paid for.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.749
I don't understand. I think
this is one of the best I've ever done.

01:20.874 --> 01:21.875
I want my money back.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.586
I'm sorry, but this is not
some department store photo studio.

01:24.711 --> 01:26.337
And this is not my wife.

01:26.463 --> 01:27.505
Yes, it is.

01:27.630 --> 01:32.051
You asked me to paint her exactly
as she looks. That's exactly what I did.

01:32.969 --> 01:34.679
Honey! Stop it!

01:34.804 --> 01:36.723
What's going on?
Brandon.

01:36.848 --> 01:41.311
That check better be in my mailbox
by Friday, or I'll be back.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.314
Come on.

01:44.898 --> 01:47.066
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:47.192 --> 01:49.819
They saw the painting,
and they just freaked out.

01:53.573 --> 01:54.824
Brandon, what is this?

01:54.949 --> 01:56.785
What do you mean?
It's her portrait.

01:58.495 --> 01:59.913
What's wrong with it?

02:41.204 --> 02:42.497
Why is this in here?

02:42.622 --> 02:44.249
First column,
last entry.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.628
Today is going
to be a good day.

02:53.383 --> 02:54.384
This him?

02:54.509 --> 02:56.094
- No.
- Yes.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.888
She means,
are you the private investigator

02:59.013 --> 03:01.724
whose bills I've tried
to slip through as medical expenses?

03:01.850 --> 03:04.477
Oh. Hi.
I'm Lucas Douglas, Pl.

03:04.602 --> 03:07.564
This hospital is not putting
a private investigator on retainer,

03:07.689 --> 03:08.982
nor is it going to pay
any more

03:09.107 --> 03:11.025
phony repairs
on vending machines,

03:11.150 --> 03:12.694
cryostats, or elevators.

03:12.819 --> 03:15.363
Information saves lives.
Saving lives saves money.

03:15.488 --> 03:17.782
No, saving lives
costs money,

03:17.907 --> 03:20.994
which is why I'm trying to make sure
there's still some left.

03:21.119 --> 03:22.662
You want
your own personal Pl,

03:22.787 --> 03:25.415
you're gonna have
to pay for him yourself.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.292
- Sorry.
- No, I understand.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.502
Hey, I like the shoes,
by the way.

03:30.003 --> 03:30.962
Oh.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.257
Thank you.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.554
You don't like her shoes,
you like her legs.

03:39.679 --> 03:41.848
It sounds less creepy
if you say shoes.

03:41.973 --> 03:43.766
Less creepy, more gay.

03:43.892 --> 03:45.393
That's my firm's motto.

03:46.477 --> 03:47.937
What is a cryostat?

03:48.062 --> 03:52.942
No idea. Whoever fixed ours
is about to get stiffed.

04:05.121 --> 04:08.249
There's no distorted perspective
in any of his other recent works.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.792
Not much talent either.

04:09.918 --> 04:11.878
It's like the symptom
just came on.

04:12.003 --> 04:14.756
Acute onset visual agnosia
points to a stroke or brain tumor.

04:14.881 --> 04:16.799
TAUB: MRI revealed
no stroke or brain tumor.

04:16.925 --> 04:18.176
We should do another
with contrast.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.761
If he's like the other
struggling artists I've known,

04:19.886 --> 04:20.887
he's also into drugs.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.514
We should...
What are you looking at?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.058
Apparently a moron.

04:25.183 --> 04:27.810
One, ER routinely tests for drugs.

04:27.936 --> 04:29.938
If it was positive,
we wouldn't be looking at this file.

04:30.063 --> 04:34.108
Two, who pays 12% interest
on a car loan?

04:34.233 --> 04:36.527
How did you...
Did you run a credit check on me?

04:36.653 --> 04:38.196
No, that would be illegal.

04:38.321 --> 04:41.407
Interestingly enough, paying someone
to run it for me, though...

04:41.532 --> 04:42.367
(SCOFFS)

04:45.203 --> 04:46.913
What?
It's part of my job.

04:47.038 --> 04:48.414
Your job
is to diagnose patients.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.540
Which I do with a team.

04:49.666 --> 04:52.418
How am I supposed to know
how best to utilize that team

04:52.543 --> 04:54.712
if I don't know
everything about them?

04:54.837 --> 04:57.840
Say that Van Gogh turns out
to have neurosyphilis,

04:57.966 --> 05:00.385
and our last vial of penicillin
is in a storeroom

05:00.510 --> 05:03.805
at the end of a 20-mile hallway
with a two-foot-high ceiling.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.140
You've discovered that one of us
has been hiding the ability

05:06.265 --> 05:08.142
to stretch or
shrink themselves?

05:08.267 --> 05:11.854
No, I would never
out someone's superpowers.

05:12.814 --> 05:14.524
This, on the other hand...

05:17.151 --> 05:19.195
You crawled 20 miles?

05:19.320 --> 05:20.863
My name's
in the Guinness Book.

05:20.989 --> 05:22.740
I'll bet that
really impresses the babes.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.617
I didn't do it
to get the babes.

05:24.742 --> 05:27.245
No, that would cheapen
the purity of your achievement.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.206
Sorry to interrupt, but we have
a patient with a probable brain tumor.

05:30.331 --> 05:33.042
Who needs an MRI with contrast.
We've established that.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.877
What do you got on Taub?

05:35.878 --> 05:37.088
I got nothing on Taub.

05:37.213 --> 05:38.131
THIRTEEN:
Could also be environmental.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.425
We should check his studio
for toxins, mold, fungus...

05:40.550 --> 05:41.759
Taub's wife,
on the other hand...

05:41.884 --> 05:42.760
FOREMAN: House.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.929
That's enough.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.058
Dad's right.
This is no time for gossip.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.519
Patient desperately needs our help.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.063
Check his head
and his house.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.107
- Can't Lucas...
- No.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.608
He's very busy.

05:59.861 --> 06:01.487
FOREMAN: If there is a tumor,
this test will show us...

06:01.612 --> 06:02.822
Is that stuff dangerous?

06:02.947 --> 06:04.907
This is just
the contrast material.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.953
There is a small risk
of an anaphylactic reaction.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.080
I could stop breathing?

06:11.205 --> 06:13.583
Don't worry. We're prepared
to deal with whatever happens.

06:13.708 --> 06:16.169
You know, I did some drawings
this morning and they seem fine.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.129
So, maybe it was just a reaction
to something I ate.

06:18.254 --> 06:19.964
FOREMAN: How many people you know
have reactions like that

06:20.089 --> 06:21.382
to something
they ate for breakfast?

06:21.507 --> 06:22.425
But if I'm
getting better...

06:22.550 --> 06:23.801
You'll continue to get better.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.386
If you're not,
we need to know why not,

06:25.511 --> 06:27.805
so we can start
treatment immediately.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.432
Baby, let them do the test.

06:43.321 --> 06:45.531
Can lead poisoning
cause visual agnosia?

06:45.656 --> 06:47.742
TAUB: Not without lead showing up
in the blood work.

06:47.867 --> 06:51.454
Nothing in the medicine cabinet
except some harmless toiletries.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.248
No signs of mold
or fungus anywhere, either.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.292
You think House really
got something on your wife?

06:56.417 --> 06:58.795
No, not that
I care if he did.

06:59.128 --> 07:02.215
Wait, your wife's doing
the doorman in your bed,

07:02.340 --> 07:04.759
and they're sweating all over the sheets
that you paid for and...

07:04.884 --> 07:06.677
- My wife's not doing the doorman.
- How do you know?

07:06.803 --> 07:09.222
We don't have a doorman.

07:09.347 --> 07:12.058
And I just do, okay?
Drop it.

07:13.184 --> 07:16.395
In college, my friends and I came up
with an Inverse-Square Law.

07:16.521 --> 07:17.772
Sounds like
a real fun group.

07:17.897 --> 07:21.317
The girls who you think
are the most inhibited, straight arrows?

07:21.442 --> 07:22.735
They're the ones
you hook up with.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.529
Are you saying
my wife's a slut?

07:24.654 --> 07:27.281
I'm saying if my wife was a slut,
I'd want to know.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.620
KUTNER:
His place was clean.

07:32.745 --> 07:34.038
So is his head.

07:34.163 --> 07:37.416
Even with contrast,
no masses, no lesions.

07:37.542 --> 07:40.461
A neurological symptom
with no apparent neurological cause.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.005
Time course means
we can rule out cancer and MS.

07:43.131 --> 07:44.966
That just leaves
toxins or drugs.

07:45.091 --> 07:47.844
You called Thirteen a moron
for thinking it was drugs.

07:47.969 --> 07:49.929
Yeah, when she said it,
she had other options.

07:50.054 --> 07:53.015
And I really just wanted a segue
into her stupid loan and your...

07:53.141 --> 07:54.851
A cavernous angioma
in the brain could leak.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.310
Once the blood
gets reabsorbed,

07:56.435 --> 07:57.812
pressure goes down,
symptom goes away.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.814
He'll never consent
to petrosal vein sampling.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.359
Really?

08:03.484 --> 08:06.237
He was nervous
about an injection of contrast.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.990
Is his girlfriend hot?

08:09.740 --> 08:10.908
I'm not talking fever, here.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.910
I mean, is she all curvy and perky?

08:13.035 --> 08:15.413
Very. And if he dies,
it's good news for all of us, but...

08:15.538 --> 08:18.291
That explains
why all his paintings suck.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.001
And what's wrong with him.

08:20.126 --> 08:21.544
Where are you going?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.296
To tell him
he may have a massive brain tumor.

08:23.421 --> 08:24.422
He doesn't.

08:24.547 --> 08:27.800
I know. I'm not a moron.
It's drugs.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.011
(DOOR OPENS)

08:31.971 --> 08:34.515
You seem to have
a massive brain tumor.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.766
Who are you?

08:35.892 --> 08:37.852
He's Dr. House.
He's pleased to meet you.

08:37.977 --> 08:39.812
We've found no trace
on any of your imaging,

08:39.937 --> 08:41.689
so we need to cut
your head open.

08:41.814 --> 08:45.026
It's risky,
but it's the only way to save your life.

08:45.151 --> 08:46.194
No.

08:46.652 --> 08:47.945
Wrong answer.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.071
I'm not allowed
to say no?

08:49.197 --> 08:51.407
You're not allowed
to not be terrified.

08:52.325 --> 08:54.410
There's only two good reasons
not to be terrified in a hospital.

08:54.535 --> 08:58.831
You're delusional, but then you're
not afraid of contrast material either,

08:58.956 --> 09:01.792
or you know you're fine.
Since we haven't told you you're fine,

09:01.918 --> 09:04.670
you obviously have information
that we don't have.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.630
What drugs are you on?

09:05.755 --> 09:06.923
His drug tests were clean.

09:07.048 --> 09:09.467
Drug tests only test for drugs
they've made tests for.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.135
What are you talking about?

09:11.260 --> 09:12.094
(SIGHS)

09:12.637 --> 09:15.348
Hottie thinks that
he's a great artist,

09:15.473 --> 09:17.183
selling art
to the rich and tasteful.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.685
She's stupid enough
to be fooled by the canvasses,

09:19.810 --> 09:22.355
but bank accounts don't lie.
He needed money.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.440
There are not many jobs you can do
that don't require time,

09:24.565 --> 09:25.775
training and intelligence.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.194
And I know you're not
a news anchor or supermodel

09:28.319 --> 09:32.531
because those jobs seldom cause agnosia.
He's a guinea pig.

09:32.657 --> 09:34.909
Companies pay him
to test their untested drugs.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.501
Did Hottie
go for a pee or coffee?

09:43.626 --> 09:47.421
'Cause either way, I don't think
we should waste any time on denials.

09:49.090 --> 09:52.134
The clinical trials
were supposed to be safe.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.928
The drugs are about to be approved
by the FDA.

09:54.053 --> 09:56.889
"Drugs"?
How many trials are you on?

09:58.015 --> 09:59.350
Three.

10:00.977 --> 10:05.022
Admirable. Not many idiots
have that much ambition.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.774
You've been symptom-free
since your admission,

10:06.899 --> 10:09.360
so whatever you took
has probably cleared your system now.

10:09.485 --> 10:10.903
You'll be fine.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.113
Keep him overnight
just to make sure,

10:12.238 --> 10:15.032
and get the names
of all the trials he's been in.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.410
You gonna tell Heather?

10:17.535 --> 10:19.412
Couldn't,
even if I cared enough to want to.

10:34.385 --> 10:37.179
Not bad.
You almost made it the whole day.

10:37.305 --> 10:38.556
What did you find out?

10:38.681 --> 10:40.808
The point is to see
how everyone reacts.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.435
You may go get
the rest of the gang.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.686
Cut the crap, House.

10:47.148 --> 10:49.483
Your wife
has a separate bank account

10:49.608 --> 10:50.609
in her name only.

10:50.735 --> 10:53.863
She's been making weekly cash deposits
for about a year now.

10:53.988 --> 10:56.157
No withdrawals yet.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.202
That's it? A bank account?

11:00.328 --> 11:01.871
A secret bank account.

11:01.996 --> 11:03.873
What makes you think
it's a secret?

11:03.998 --> 11:08.002
Because if it wasn't
you would call it "the" bank account.

11:08.127 --> 11:12.298
Damn, always forget to use
the right article when lying.

11:12.423 --> 11:14.342
It's not secret.
We're refurnishing.

11:14.467 --> 11:15.843
We set the budget,
set up an account.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.887
I just couldn't make it to the bank
the day we opened it.

11:18.012 --> 11:21.599

that discussion,

- I know it's weird.

20:31.189 --> 20:34.192
But if you pay me while I check you out,
it's all cool.

20:34.318 --> 20:36.236
And you'd get value.
You'd get leverage against him.

20:36.361 --> 20:37.487
Help you keep him in line.

20:37.613 --> 20:39.156
You think I need help
keeping House in line?

20:39.281 --> 20:40.324
No.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.952
Nope. I'm sorry.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.747
This hospital can't afford...

20:46.872 --> 20:48.498
Oh, whatever you can afford.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.255
How did you know
I liked roses?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.049
I was in your house
last night.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.551
(CHUCKLING)
No, I'm kidding.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.471
Who the hell
doesn't like roses?

21:16.485 --> 21:17.361
I forgot to tell you,

21:17.486 --> 21:20.489
the Parker Quartet is going to play
at the library fundraiser.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.245
That's it?
It was your idea.

21:28.372 --> 21:29.539
They'll be great.

21:30.165 --> 21:31.375
Mmm-hmm.

21:36.838 --> 21:37.839
You Okay?

21:40.258 --> 21:42.594
I couldn't find
the letter opener.

21:42.719 --> 21:47.265
I went through some of the drawers
in your desk, looking for it.

21:47.391 --> 21:52.354
There were a bunch of statements
in there from Jefferson Mutual.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.532
I was so close.

22:04.992 --> 22:06.076
To what?

22:06.201 --> 22:10.038
You've got $83,000 socked away
in a secret account.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.665
Not anymore.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.253
I wanted to keep it a surprise,

22:19.548 --> 22:21.633
but I bought you the car.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.386
(LAUGHING)

22:25.429 --> 22:26.555
Uh...

22:27.139 --> 22:29.266
The one that I...

22:29.391 --> 22:30.559
(CHUCKLES)

22:30.684 --> 22:36.231
I knew you would never buy it yourself,
so I've been saving.

22:36.815 --> 22:39.317
And it's gonna be delivered
on Friday.

22:39.443 --> 22:40.819
(BOTH LAUGHING)

22:44.031 --> 22:45.991
You are amazing.

22:47.868 --> 22:48.827
Lucky you.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.537
(LAUGHING)

22:54.541 --> 22:57.210
We've gradually
reduced your dosage.

22:57.335 --> 22:58.587
You're actually drug-free now.

22:58.712 --> 23:01.339
I feel great.
Thanks to you.

23:01.465 --> 23:03.592
All part of the job.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.344
Your blood pressure is normal.
Can you sit up?

23:09.681 --> 23:10.849
Hey!

23:11.641 --> 23:12.476
What are you...

23:12.601 --> 23:13.894
(BOTH GRUNTING)

23:14.019 --> 23:15.437
(GROANS)

23:20.609 --> 23:21.443
What happened to his face?

23:21.568 --> 23:23.320
Question is,
what happened to his hormones?

23:23.445 --> 23:25.989
We're gonna need
an ice pack in here.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.162
<i>KUTNER: We can rule out
the clinical trial drugs at this point.</i>

23:32.287 --> 23:34.164
His system has been
completely cleaned twice.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.333
So unless the drugs found
a hiding place under the stairs...

23:36.458 --> 23:38.960
Drugs could have set off
a dormant neurological condition.

23:39.086 --> 23:42.923
Good point.
Coming clean causes a lot of damage.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.133
Alienation, divorce...

23:45.550 --> 23:47.469
My wife's buying me a car.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.847
- I was talking about the patient.
- You were wrong.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.016
The divorce was metaphorical.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.143
FOREMAN: What about
Kluver-Bucy Syndrome?

23:55.268 --> 23:56.978
Bilateral lesions
in the temporal lobes.

23:57.104 --> 23:59.481
Visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality
are the key symptoms.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.233
Good thing he's got
that girlfriend.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.151
If it's Kluver-Bucy,
his brain will melt down,

24:03.276 --> 24:04.653
he'll try to swallow
his own hands

24:04.778 --> 24:06.822
and she can take care of him
for the rest of his talentless life.

24:06.947 --> 24:07.948
You owe me an apology.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.950
Any rationalization
you had for meddling

24:10.075 --> 24:11.743
in my private life
disappeared

24:11.868 --> 24:12.869
when she had
good reason...

24:12.994 --> 24:14.287
You're right.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.583
Fact is,
nothing I said applies.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.210
You had no reason
to forgive her,

24:20.335 --> 24:24.047
therefore no reason to seek forgiveness,
no reason to be an idiot.

24:27.342 --> 24:30.095
Kluver-Bucy wouldn't explain
the seizure or the cytokine storm.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.471
Withdrawal complications.

24:31.596 --> 24:34.015
Then again,
she is handing you a giant gift

24:34.141 --> 24:35.433
that you don't think you deserve.

24:35.559 --> 24:38.562
The fact that the MRI showed no lesions
on the temporal lobe tends to rule out

24:38.687 --> 24:40.021
your "lesions
on the temporal lobe" theory.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.899
The damage can be a circulatory issue,
rather than structural.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.943
We wouldn't see that
on the MRI.

24:45.068 --> 24:45.944
Foreman's right.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.737
Go call your wife,
tell her you're not coming home,

24:47.863 --> 24:50.657
say you have to give
a patient a cranial MR angiogram,

24:50.782 --> 24:53.326
then say good night
and hang up.

25:15.098 --> 25:20.061
Odd that a man who can't run
would own so many pairs of sneakers.

25:20.187 --> 25:22.105
You mind hanging this up
when you're done?

25:23.231 --> 25:25.609
I have to find something
embarrassing about you.

25:25.734 --> 25:29.446
No, you don't.
I ordered us Indian.

25:29.571 --> 25:33.033
Not too embarrassing.
Just something credible.

25:33.158 --> 25:37.037
Well, if you hand her that,
she's not gonna need you anymore.

25:37.162 --> 25:39.247
If I don't hand her anything,
she'll think I'm incompetent.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.459
I don't care if she thinks
you're incompetent.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.336
This isn't gonna work.

25:44.461 --> 25:46.129
It's worked so far.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.923
I'm not good at lying.

25:48.048 --> 25:48.882
I know.

25:49.007 --> 25:51.760
That's why your cover is
that you want to do her.

25:51.885 --> 25:54.679
I like her.
I don't want to do her.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.890
Then what's the point
of liking her?

25:57.015 --> 25:59.809
I meant I don't just want to do her.
I like her.

25:59.935 --> 26:02.437
What do you think
you're gonna find out about her?

26:03.104 --> 26:06.942
Something personal,
something embarrassing.

26:07.067 --> 26:10.278
I spend half my life
negotiating with that woman.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.156
Anything I can use
to scare her into saying yes.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.246
Okay-

26:21.539 --> 26:22.791
"Okay"?

26:22.916 --> 26:26.378
You're okay with being paid twice
to facilitate blackmail?

26:26.503 --> 26:29.297
I'm okay. I don't believe you.
But I'm okay.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.760
You're doing this
for the same reason I'm doing this.

26:33.885 --> 26:35.595
We'll see
who gets there first.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.936
Here it is. Circle of Willis,
the vessels are narrow.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.189
Narrow for you,
normal for him.

26:46.314 --> 26:47.607
If there were problems
with the vessels,

26:47.732 --> 26:49.109
he would have had symptoms
long ago.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.861
- Not if something else changed.
- Like?

26:51.987 --> 26:52.821
TAUB: His heart.

26:52.946 --> 26:54.781
He could have recently gotten
an intermittent arrhythmia.

26:54.906 --> 26:57.450
I know "heart" and "head" start
with the same three letters,

26:57.575 --> 27:00.036
but you've got to read
all the way to the end.

27:00.161 --> 27:01.788
The experimental drugs
cause an arrhythmia

27:01.913 --> 27:03.581
which causes low blood pressure.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.250
Combine that
with those narrow vessels,

27:05.375 --> 27:06.918
the brain doesn't
get enough blood.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.753
That causes
all of his symptoms.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.547
If we can trigger the arrhythmia
and identify it,

27:10.672 --> 27:13.174
we might be able to stop it
from killing him.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.095
- Been home?
- No.

27:18.513 --> 27:21.474
Good. Do an EP study.
Find the arrhythmia.

27:24.769 --> 27:27.314
We're gonna insert three
electrical catheters into your heart.

27:27.439 --> 27:28.857
Tell Dr. Hadley I'm sorry.

27:28.982 --> 27:31.568
She understands,
and you should tell her yourself.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.069
Maybe I should tell
Heather about it.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.404
You're gonna be fine.

27:34.529 --> 27:38.867
She's so supportive, she's so great.
All I do is lie to her.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.369
What happens if you tell her?

27:41.786 --> 27:43.246
I don't know.

27:43.371 --> 27:44.956
You love her, right?

27:45.081 --> 27:46.333
More than anything,
and she loves me.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.710
If you open your mouth,
one of two things happens,

27:48.835 --> 27:50.962
she either forgives you
or she leaves you.

27:51.087 --> 27:54.049
At best, you wind up
exactly where you are right now.

27:54.174 --> 27:57.052
It's noble to want to confess.
Really, it is.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.679
But if the result's
just damage and pain,

27:59.804 --> 28:01.973
that's not noble,
it's selfish.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.520
TAUB: Stimulate right atrium.

28:07.645 --> 28:08.772
Normal conduction.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.149
How long you plan
on keeping me from going home?

28:11.274 --> 28:13.443
Until you're convinced
I'm a different person,

28:13.568 --> 28:15.653
one who won't do
anything stupid?

28:16.571 --> 28:20.075
Guilt fades quickly.
By Wednesday, you'll be fine.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.995
Right ventricle.
And why do you want it to fade?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.122
Why do you suddenly care
about my marriage?

28:26.247 --> 28:28.166
Because if it ain't broke...

28:28.291 --> 28:29.918
You obviously think
it is broke.

28:30.043 --> 28:31.461
And you obviously
think it ain't.

28:31.586 --> 28:33.296
Your marriage
is like a broken toaster.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.382
Bread keeps popping out,
and you keep calling it toast,

28:35.507 --> 28:37.759
which is weird because you've put
your bread in a lot of toasters,

28:37.884 --> 28:40.470
and apparently you don't see any
difference. It's kind of fascinating.

28:40.595 --> 28:42.013
(MACHINE BEEPING)
He's going into V-tach.

28:42.138 --> 28:42.972
What's wrong?

28:43.098 --> 28:45.183
Good news,
test is working.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.852
Your heart's freaking out, but it's cool
that you're still conscious.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.562
(WHEEZING)
Try to overdrive.

28:50.188 --> 28:51.439
Didn't work.

28:55.610 --> 28:56.611
(PANTING)

28:57.862 --> 29:00.865
This might burn a little bit.
Charging to 60. Clear.

29:01.241 --> 29:02.367
Ow!

29:03.284 --> 29:05.120
Going again.
Charging to 120.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.247
Have you been
dyeing your hair?

29:08.998 --> 29:10.917
- No.
- House. Clear.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.252
Right.

29:12.919 --> 29:13.962
(GROANS)

29:15.213 --> 29:16.589
Your hair's growing in red.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.508
(BRANDON PANTING)

29:18.633 --> 29:20.969
TAUB:
His heart rate is stabilized.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.263
Does your theory include
any genetic mutations

29:23.388 --> 29:25.682
that could cause
his hair to change color?

29:26.766 --> 29:29.644
Then either
he's lying about dyeing

29:30.520 --> 29:32.230
or just dying.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.777
Red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.238
Melanin affects hair color.
What affects melanin?

29:40.363 --> 29:42.323
- Hormones.
- Hormone panels were all normal.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.491
Age.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.368
He's turning prematurely crimson?

29:45.493 --> 29:46.578
FOREMAN:
A genetic disorder.

29:46.703 --> 29:49.622
Waardenburg Syndrome causes
arrhythmias and can change hair color.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.291
And make you deaf. Next.

29:51.416 --> 29:54.544
I found a long QT interval.
I think it's Romano-Ward Syndrome.

29:54.669 --> 29:56.421
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.

29:56.546 --> 29:57.672
But not the ginger nut.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.467
FOREMAN: If he's got Romano's,
he's got at least five gene mutations.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.760
It's not a big leap to think he has
others that would give him the hair.

30:02.886 --> 30:05.847
It also gives him the likelihood
of sudden and unexpected death.

30:05.972 --> 30:09.767
Beta blockers don't work.
His heart can't handle an ICD.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.269
Pete Best.

30:15.899 --> 30:19.194
Good God, has none of you
ever read a history book?

30:19.319 --> 30:21.488
The original Beatles drummer.

30:21.613 --> 30:23.865
A bunch of nerves
controls the tempo of the heart.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.451
They're all playing in time,
except one dude who can't keep the beat,

30:26.576 --> 30:28.953
wrecks the whole thing,
so we hire Ringo.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.747
Pete Best was actually
a great drummer.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.458
But I assume you mean the patient
needs a cardiac sympathectomy?

30:33.583 --> 30:34.792
I probably should have
just said that, huh?

30:34.918 --> 30:38.129
You start cutting nerves, you risk
his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating...

30:38.254 --> 30:41.716
So he saves a fortune
on karaoke machines and deodorant.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.843
You think he's stable
enough for surgery?

30:45.595 --> 30:47.388
If he was,
he wouldn't need it.

30:51.559 --> 30:52.810
CUDDY: Wow.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.942
- Wow.
- Yeah.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.778
Do you have
any brothers and sisters?

31:01.903 --> 31:03.112
One sister.

31:03.238 --> 31:04.948
He told me he was
on the lacrosse team.

31:05.073 --> 31:09.285
In high school. In college he just
cheered the lacrosse team on to victory.

31:09.410 --> 31:10.870
- Wow.
- Yeah.

31:11.788 --> 31:13.540
How was your relationship
with your dad?

31:13.665 --> 31:15.875
Fine.
You have three more questions.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.168
How was your relationship
with your mom?

31:17.293 --> 31:18.336
Fine.

31:18.461 --> 31:20.630
When did you lose
your virginity?

31:20.755 --> 31:24.300
Not something I discuss
with co-workers in an elevator.

31:26.261 --> 31:27.595
And...

31:28.513 --> 31:29.806
And...

31:32.684 --> 31:33.977
You know, don't you?

31:37.021 --> 31:39.440
Bit of a wasted
third question

31:40.024 --> 31:42.110
'cause the answer is
"Know what?"

31:42.235 --> 31:43.778
Okay,
bear with me here,

31:43.903 --> 31:47.740
because some people sometimes consider
my thought processes complicated.

31:47.865 --> 31:51.077
I'm into you
'cause you're hot and smart,

31:51.202 --> 31:53.413
in that order,
but both are needed.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.039
Photos can be retouched,

31:55.164 --> 31:58.918
and House is an evil genius,
which makes this photo suspicious.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.670
And yet you're
not suspicious.

32:00.795 --> 32:02.714
Which means either you're not
smart enough to be suspicious,

32:02.839 --> 32:06.467
in which case,
I am less interested in you.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.137
Or you're not suspicious
because you know

32:09.262 --> 32:12.015
this is actually
a doctored photo of House.

32:12.140 --> 32:15.310
In which case,
I am more interested in you.

32:15.435 --> 32:17.395
But I'm wasting my time
because you know

32:17.520 --> 32:19.063
this is a game
we are playing on you

32:19.188 --> 32:22.108
and I am busted
and I'm screwed.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.571
I know the photo's a fake.

32:27.405 --> 32:29.365
I know this is a game.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.159
Sorry.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.455
Too bad.

32:37.874 --> 32:39.459
Good bye.

32:46.215 --> 32:50.219
So you knew that I wasn't
gonna give you anything worthwhile?

32:50.345 --> 32:53.264
And you were never gonna give me
anything worthwhile?

32:55.058 --> 32:56.893
Then why did you bother
coming out with me?

32:57.018 --> 32:59.562
I wanted to screw with House.

33:00.772 --> 33:04.609
By wasting my time?
That doesn't make sense.

33:06.152 --> 33:10.281
No.
There must be another reason.

33:11.449 --> 33:12.408
Hmm.

33:12.533 --> 33:15.286
Is it okay
if I sit back down here?

33:16.245 --> 33:17.538
(CHUCKLES)

33:19.666 --> 33:21.167
<i>THIRTEEN:
Your heartbeat's out of control.</i>

33:21.292 --> 33:24.712
We need to surgically sever the
connection between your heart and brain.

33:24.837 --> 33:28.174
We believe it's necessary,
but you need to know the ramifications.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.093
You'll never be able
to feel angina.

33:30.218 --> 33:32.303
You may not know
if you have a heart attack,

33:32.428 --> 33:34.430
may not be able
to get help in time.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.808
Where are my regular doctors?

33:36.933 --> 33:37.934
Regular doctors?

33:38.059 --> 33:39.894
Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.063
Why aren't they telling me this?

33:42.188 --> 33:44.899
Brandon, I am Dr. Hadley,
and this is Dr. Taub.

33:45.983 --> 33:50.279
What are you talking about?
I've never seen you before in my life.

33:56.369 --> 33:57.704
TAUB:
We can't do the surgery.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.455
We're back to where we started,
visual agnosia.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.207
We need to re-examine
neurological disorders,

34:01.332 --> 34:03.209
- something slowly progressing.
- This isn't progressing.

34:03.334 --> 34:05.169
It's there,
then it's not, then it is.

34:05.294 --> 34:07.839
It's a new symptom, intermittence.

34:09.006 --> 34:10.007
It's irrelevant.

34:10.133 --> 34:11.884
Since when
is a new symptom irrelevant?

34:12.009 --> 34:13.845
Since it points towards
the same disease.

34:13.970 --> 34:15.596
Intermittence can fit
with Romano-Ward.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.181
We still need to do
a sympathectomy.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.142
Maybe we missed something, toxins.

34:19.267 --> 34:21.602
When?
When you checked every bottle,

34:21.728 --> 34:24.439
every can, every tube of paint,
or when you detoxed him twice?

34:24.564 --> 34:26.524
Maybe there was
a batch of toxic paint

34:26.649 --> 34:28.109
that he used up
a few months ago.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.027
Then he would have been
sick months ago, not now.

34:30.153 --> 34:31.779
He's lost weight
since he got here.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.573
That's a symptom of trying
to cram hospital food

34:33.698 --> 34:35.032
down a throat
he can barely get air down.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.200
It's not a symptom,

34:36.325 --> 34:40.079
but what if the toxins were stored
in his fat cells a year ago,

34:40.204 --> 34:44.500
and now they're being
released into his bloodstream?

34:44.625 --> 34:47.503
So where are you gonna
get this old paint, the city dump?

34:47.628 --> 34:50.673
On his old paintings.
We know he hasn't sold one in ages,

34:50.798 --> 34:54.051
but there weren't many in his studio.
He's hid them somewhere.

34:54.886 --> 34:57.180
If you're wrong,
he could drop dead

34:57.305 --> 35:00.266
from Romano-Ward at any moment.
You okay with that?

35:00.391 --> 35:02.518
Just give me a few hours.

35:02.643 --> 35:03.936
You got one.

35:11.068 --> 35:12.945
I need to talk
to him alone.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.948
It's about your work.
Your paintings.

35:16.073 --> 35:19.619
I need to look at all the ones
you've sold recently.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.292
Honey, can you
give us a minute?

35:26.417 --> 35:28.294
To talk about
your paintings?

35:30.296 --> 35:32.924
Brandon, please.
Tell me what's going on.

35:40.556 --> 35:46.145
I've only sold two paintings
in the last three years, since we met.

35:47.438 --> 35:49.106
One was to my cousin.

35:49.232 --> 35:52.151
I've been making money
enrolling in drug trials.

35:52.276 --> 35:54.946
Two, three at a time.

36:01.869 --> 36:04.121
Why did you lie to me?

36:04.247 --> 36:05.623
I want to be...

36:07.875 --> 36:11.587
The way you look at me,
the way it makes me feel...

36:11.712 --> 36:16.384
I want to be what you see
when you look at me.

36:21.055 --> 36:23.057
You think
I'm that shallow?

36:24.433 --> 36:28.855
When I look at you,
I see you.

36:42.994 --> 36:44.161
So,

36:47.039 --> 36:48.958
where are the ones
you didn't sell?

37:02.138 --> 37:03.097
(THUDDING)

38:10.748 --> 38:12.291
(PHONE RINGING)

38:17.129 --> 38:18.965
It's not the paint,
it's the drugs.

38:19.090 --> 38:20.299
He's not on the drugs

38:20.424 --> 38:21.300
I know it doesn't make sense,

38:21.425 --> 38:23.636
but I'm looking at his paintings
for the last six months.

38:23.761 --> 38:26.597
They're normal
April, June and August,

38:26.722 --> 38:29.809
but they're distorted
May, July, September.

38:29.934 --> 38:32.228
Every other month,
he was having visual agnosia

38:32.353 --> 38:35.356
because every other month, he was
on all three drugs simultaneously.

38:35.481 --> 38:38.401
The statin was one month on,
one month off.

38:38.526 --> 38:40.194
I don't know why the symptoms
keep coming and going,

38:40.319 --> 38:41.946
but it is the drugs.

38:42.738 --> 38:44.323
They're hiding
under the stairs.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.117
In the fat?
That doesn't make sense.

38:46.242 --> 38:47.410
<i>These drugs aren't fat soluble.</i>

38:47.535 --> 38:49.620
I said stairs, not closet.

38:49.745 --> 38:52.498
What was the last drug he was on
before the drugs he was on

38:52.623 --> 38:53.749
<i>when the symptoms started?</i>

38:53.874 --> 38:55.001
I'm not sure, I think...

38:55.126 --> 38:56.419
Antacid.

38:57.003 --> 38:58.963
- How do you know?
- It makes sense.

38:59.839 --> 39:01.674
Also, I'm looking
at the file.

39:03.843 --> 39:05.177
(PHONE RINGING)

39:06.512 --> 39:07.638
Yes.

39:11.475 --> 39:12.852
It's Dr. House.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.937
Wake him up.
We're done.

39:15.062 --> 39:18.149
No, no, he says he needs surgery,
but not this one.

39:18.274 --> 39:19.567
Did he give any specifics?

39:19.692 --> 39:22.486
Abdominal surgery
to remove a bezoar.

39:24.113 --> 39:27.992
It's like a hairball,
but it's made up of undigested food.

39:28.117 --> 39:30.036
You can get it
if your stomach acid's low,

39:30.161 --> 39:33.330
which Brandon's was
because of an experimental antacid.

39:33.456 --> 39:35.708
<i>The fruit and vegetable
fibers and skins</i>

39:35.833 --> 39:38.044
<i>get stuck together
and form a ball.</i>

39:38.169 --> 39:40.880
<i>It gets sticky,
ferments, grows.</i>

39:41.005 --> 39:43.507
<i>It starts sucking up
some of the pills he'd taken.</i>

39:43.632 --> 39:46.802
<i>Some are never heard from again,
but some get released.</i>

39:46.927 --> 39:48.929
<i>For the last week,
it's basically been giving him</i>

39:49.055 --> 39:51.682
<i>massive doses
of all three at once.</i>

39:56.437 --> 40:00.066
That is why I won't
let Cameron buy a cat.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.359
He should be fine.

40:02.485 --> 40:03.861
(CHUCKLES)

40:05.863 --> 40:07.865
Are you glad
he told you the truth?

40:07.990 --> 40:09.825
Yes. Of course.

40:12.078 --> 40:16.040
But were you happier
before you knew?

40:24.882 --> 40:27.093
About 10 more feet.

40:27.218 --> 40:30.012
I do know what it looks like,
so maybe this whole blindfold thing...

40:30.137 --> 40:33.140
Shh. My gift, my rules.
Bump!

40:34.433 --> 40:36.185
All right,
if you don't like the color,

40:36.310 --> 40:37.436
apparently we can exchange it,

40:37.561 --> 40:39.980
but I'm hoping...
You ready?

40:43.025 --> 40:44.360
Ta-da!

40:45.569 --> 40:46.821
(CHUCKLES)

40:47.363 --> 40:48.823
Do you like it?

40:55.996 --> 40:57.414
Baby, are you okay?

41:06.715 --> 41:08.425
We need to talk.

41:11.554 --> 41:13.597
<i>(PIANO PLAYING)</i>

41:32.616 --> 41:34.285
She didn't buy it.

41:34.410 --> 41:35.786
Damn.

41:35.911 --> 41:37.454
(PIANO PLAYING)

41:37.580 --> 41:39.081
So, you didn't get anything?

41:39.206 --> 41:42.543
Nothing.
We probably overstepped.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.337
You're really not
the cheerleader type.

41:45.462 --> 41:49.508
On the other hand, I figured she
probably wouldn't figure me as the

41:49.633 --> 41:54.096
"Photoshopping a photo and planting it
in a college paper" type either.

41:54.221 --> 41:57.141
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah. About that,

41:58.726 --> 42:00.853
I took a little trip
to your alma mater.

42:02.521 --> 42:06.192
You took a little trip
150 miles?

42:06.317 --> 42:10.779
Online, by phone.
I meant I did research.

42:16.076 --> 42:17.786
That's a real photo,
isn't it?

42:19.788 --> 42:20.623
(EXCLAIMS)

42:20.748 --> 42:22.333
Wow, that is humiliating.

42:22.458 --> 42:24.126
(PIANO PLAYING)

42:25.252 --> 42:27.046
There was a girl.

42:28.339 --> 42:30.049
Even more so.

42:30.174 --> 42:32.676
That's too bad. You wanted her
to see you in a different light,

42:32.801 --> 42:35.679
and not only
didn't she see it,

42:35.804 --> 42:38.557
but she didn't even believe
it was possible.

42:39.767 --> 42:43.604
You know, people hate people
who have theories about people.

42:52.238 --> 42:53.822
You want me to back off?

42:53.948 --> 42:55.908
Would you?

42:56.033 --> 42:57.743
I barely know you.

42:57.868 --> 43:00.287
(HARMONIZING)
