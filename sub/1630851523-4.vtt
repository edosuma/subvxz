WEBVTT

00:07.137 --> 00:10.358
Hey! I noticed someone
ate all the Oreos I bought,

00:10.401 --> 00:12.099
which is crazy because
I've had them in the house

00:12.142 --> 00:14.492
for less than 24 hours.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.580
I didn't want
to say anything,

00:15.624 --> 00:17.495
but I think the
contractor ate them.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.497
Liar! He is a liar!

00:19.541 --> 00:21.412
I watched him eat
the whole thing.

00:21.456 --> 00:22.457
Cookie Bogarter!

00:22.500 --> 00:24.198
Really? The contractor?

00:24.241 --> 00:26.765
Yeah. And if you want
to blow up the renovations

00:26.809 --> 00:29.159
'cause of some cookies,
I got your back 100%,

00:29.203 --> 00:30.726
but I think that might be
shortsighted.

00:30.769 --> 00:34.077
I witnessed the gluttonous
feast; it was unseemly.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.687
There was shame in
the man's eyes.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.038
Wait, what are you looking at?
Is it the ghosts?

00:38.081 --> 00:40.997
Crumbs everywhere!
Why not use plate?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.694
They're telling on me,
aren't they?

00:42.738 --> 00:45.567
- You are busted.
- This isn't fair.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.787
You got a whole team of spies
watching my every move.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.354
I mean, they don't
tell me everything.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.052
Well, one of the cookies
fell to the floor,

00:52.095 --> 00:53.270
after which he ate it.

00:53.314 --> 00:56.056
- Oh, you ate a floor Oreo?
- Not cool, guys!

00:56.099 --> 00:57.448
Not cool.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.450
I would have called it
a "Flooreo."

00:59.494 --> 01:01.104
That's just my improv
training kicking in.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.671
<i>Flooreo.</i>

01:02.714 --> 01:05.543
I wish I possessed the ability
to write that down.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.857
You know, every time I talk
to the contractor,

01:14.900 --> 01:16.859
it's like he adds another
two weeks to the timeline,

01:16.902 --> 01:18.252
or five grand to the budget.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.601
Well, you know what?
Here's an idea.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.255
Next time we see him,
let's just run away.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.430
Bulletproof plan,
babe.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.909
Hi, there.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.607
Oh, who's this?

01:25.650 --> 01:26.869
Henry and Margaret
Farnsby.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.827
Wealthy next-door neighbors.
Total squares.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.699
Henry and Margaret Farnsby.
Wealthy next-door neighbors.

01:30.742 --> 01:31.743
Total squares.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.136
Did you just say,
"total squares?"

01:33.180 --> 01:35.138
Ghost word. I guess
they're uptight.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.488
Yeah, man, they're all
like "rules, yay!"

01:37.532 --> 01:39.099
Oh, butterfly.

01:39.142 --> 01:42.754
I'm Margaret Farnsby.
This is my husband, Henry.

01:42.798 --> 01:45.670
Hey.
We've been dying to
swing by, say welcome.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.108
Drop off some of my
award-winning cupcakes.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.240
First place at the
St. Anne's parish bake sale

01:50.284 --> 01:51.937
seven years running.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.330
Not that we like to brag.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.940
He's lying, we love to brag.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.336
You are so sweet.
I'm Samantha, this is Jay.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.425
Fair warning, he's a pretty
talented chef himself.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.774
Yeah, might give
your cupcakes

02:02.818 --> 02:04.950
a run for their money
this year, Margaret.

02:04.994 --> 02:08.171
Well, I certainly don't
think that would be appreciated.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.956
Oh, no, I was kidding.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.003
Oh!

02:14.046 --> 02:15.787
Our new neighbors are funny.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.050
I love it!

02:18.094 --> 02:20.052
Bless you.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.706
Pardon. Uh, allergies.

02:21.750 --> 02:25.188
Sneezing in public.
So unladylike.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.755
I told her a nip of cocaine

02:26.798 --> 02:28.670
would wipe that hay fever
right out, but does she listen?

02:28.713 --> 02:30.193
I'm sorry, did you say
cocaine?

02:30.237 --> 02:32.456
Mm-hmm. Everyone knows cocaine's
excellent for allergies.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.329
Okay, well, in the 1980s
it was a Schedule II narcotic.

02:35.372 --> 02:39.159
Well, Peter, in the 1880s
it was a medical wonder drug.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.856
From headache to hysteria,

02:40.899 --> 02:43.946
four out of five barbers
prefer cocaine.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.643
We heard you're doing
some construction,

02:45.687 --> 02:47.602
emphasis on the "heard."

02:47.645 --> 02:49.081
Sorry, it'll just be
a little while.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.735
We're fixing the place up.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.129
Yeah, we're gonna turn it into
a pretty sick bed-and-breakfast.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.217
Pretty sick?

02:54.261 --> 02:56.045
No-- Oh, sick is like,
it's a good thing.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.046
- Yeah.
- It's like slang.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.744
Slang and earrings.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.703
That's fun.

03:01.746 --> 03:04.009
I don't love the idea of
a "pretty sick" business

03:04.053 --> 03:05.576
adjoining our property.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.795
Well, you know, I think,
I think you're just

03:06.838 --> 03:08.449
getting caught up
on that one phrase.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.233
Well, I don't know if
you're aware, but the zoning

03:10.277 --> 03:12.670
rules of our local Historical
Preservation Board

03:12.714 --> 03:16.196
require you to seek a permit
to operate as a B and B.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.241
Oh, I'm aware. We've applied
for all the permits.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.547
Oh, yeah,
every single one.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.549
Well, I-I don't see this
getting approved.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.160
Well, uh, with all due respect,

03:24.204 --> 03:26.075
it's not really up to you.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.859
Actually, it is.

03:27.903 --> 03:31.254
You see, I'm the head
of the Preservation Board.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.691
Enjoy those cupcakes.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.433
- Oh, I loathe
the Farnsbys.

03:36.477 --> 03:39.393
They've been the Woodstone
family rivals for generations.

03:39.436 --> 03:43.092
Oh, yeah, their family were also
robber barons, right?

03:43.135 --> 03:45.747
Yes, but please don't put us
in the same category.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.271
The children that worked in our
factories were far happier.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.753
Hey, hey, Henry! Margaret!
Wait up, wait up, wait up.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.625
Listen, I-I think you got the
wrong impression of us, okay?

03:54.669 --> 03:56.236
We're not some young,
crazy city folk

03:56.279 --> 03:58.586
trying to run
a rock 'n' roll hotel.

03:58.629 --> 03:59.848
No. We're not even that cool.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.676
I mean, Jay, he plays with
action figures.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.417
Well, I don't play with
them, 'cause if you play

04:03.460 --> 04:04.548
with them it lowers value.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.202
- See? Not cool.
- Okay.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.856
Uh, you know what?
Why don't you guys just

04:07.899 --> 04:09.727
come over for dinner tonight,
and then you'll see.

04:09.771 --> 04:12.034
You'll see, we're-we're
just a normal couple.

04:12.077 --> 04:16.560
Well, I suppose I wouldn't mind
a meal from a professional chef.

04:16.604 --> 04:17.779
Yes, we'd love to come.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.084
Great.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.521
Already got
- dessert.
- Oh.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.958
I just want to pet you.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.003
Whee-hee-hee.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.310
So, I'm thinking we go
full charm offensive.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.225
We butter them up,
and then we reopen

04:29.269 --> 04:30.357
the discussion
about the B and B.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.706
Mm-hmm.

04:31.749 --> 04:34.709
Oh! This is too much food
for just two people.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.798
Wait a minute, are we having
a dinner party?

04:36.841 --> 04:39.191
Yeah, we sort of made a bad
impression on the neighbors.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.454
Yeah, I know.
I was there.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.370
- Oh, Pete just came in.
- The arrow guy?

04:43.413 --> 04:46.373
Or the award-winning travel
agent or the great dad.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.897
But sure, Arrow Guy,
let's go with that.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.159
So, what time is soup on?

04:50.202 --> 04:52.117
You know, it's kind of
a big night for us,

04:52.161 --> 04:54.337
so I was sort of hoping
maybe you guys would

04:54.381 --> 04:55.643
just give us some space.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.732
Uh, yes, sir, Pete,
you gots to go.

04:57.775 --> 05:00.561
- No ghosts allowed.
- But we love
dinner parties.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.564
The smells, the fashions,
the banter.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.479
But sure, there's other stuff
we can do.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.741
Yeah, is that okay?
Yeah.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.351
There's a spider in
the attic that's spinning

05:08.395 --> 05:09.874
some pretty interesting stuff.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.528
Oh, and I haven't tried to
remember all the <i>Star Trek</i>

05:11.572 --> 05:13.269
characters' names in a bit.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.227
I mean, there's Spock,
obviously.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.404
What is she talking about, we
can't attend the dinner party?

05:17.447 --> 05:18.579
Who is coming?

05:18.622 --> 05:19.841
Well, the Farnsbys.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.408
All the more reason
to have us.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.800
They're terrible company.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.412
No, Samantha will be
appreciative we're there.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.065
She actually explicitly
said she'd appreciate it

05:27.109 --> 05:28.328
if we were not there.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.894
But there hasn't been
a dinner party here

05:29.938 --> 05:32.680
in over a decade;
this isn't fair.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.638
Ah, I live for
dinner parties.

05:34.682 --> 05:37.772
The repartee, the gentle
mocking of the hostess

05:37.815 --> 05:39.077
when she leaves the room.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.818
"You call those
potatoes, Abigail?"

05:41.863 --> 05:43.038
That kind of thing,
you know.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.170
It's settled.
We shall attend.
Yes.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.520
Wait, what are we attending?

05:46.563 --> 05:47.912
Guys, she was really adamant.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.392
She does not want us there.

05:49.436 --> 05:53.135
Oh, fine. Then,
as a compromise for Samantha,

05:53.178 --> 05:54.919
I shall limit
the guest list to me

05:54.963 --> 05:56.399
and three ghosts
of my choosing.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.140
No, that is not what she wants.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.402
Wait, why do you get to choose?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.751
Because I built this house.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.492
And that smart aleck question,
along with your

06:02.536 --> 06:04.755
incomplete formal attire,
leaves you out in the cold.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.191
You can't keep me out.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.237
No, but Thor can,
as my muscle

06:08.280 --> 06:09.499
and my dear honored guest.

06:09.543 --> 06:12.589
- Yes! Made list!
- Congratulations.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.286
The other two attendees
shall be...

06:14.330 --> 06:16.898
Alberta and Isaac.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.595
Huzzah!

06:18.639 --> 06:20.771
I had plans, but I'll
move some things around.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.860
Okay, this is insane.
When I was alive,

06:22.904 --> 06:26.298
I threw the party. I-I made
the par-- I <i>was</i> the party.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.866
Hetty, please. I need this.

06:28.910 --> 06:32.087
This sad display certainly made
me confident in my decision.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.877
Welcome to our
humble abode.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.052
Thank you.

06:41.096 --> 06:42.314
We brought you a bottle

06:42.358 --> 06:44.404
- from our private collection.
- Thank you.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.624
Damn, that is some good
shh-- chardonnay.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.147
Let me show you
to the dining room.

06:49.191 --> 06:53.587
Presenting neighbors
Henry and Margaret Farnsby.

06:53.630 --> 06:56.024
- Thor, what are you doing?
- Hetty told me to.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.895
Oh, no.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.115
Samantha, is this
tablecloth a joke?

07:00.158 --> 07:01.725
It is for a picnic.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.901
Ooh. What vintage is that?
Let me see.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.470
No-

07:07.514 --> 07:10.299
A... Woodstone Mansion
tradition!

07:11.126 --> 07:12.344
He is so funny.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.738
And you are so clumsy.

07:14.782 --> 07:15.435
Service!

07:21.528 --> 07:23.007
So what do you
guys do for fun?

07:23.051 --> 07:25.183
You know what we've
just recently discovered

07:25.227 --> 07:26.489
is pickleball.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.795
- Mm.
Yeah.
Fastest growing sport

07:27.838 --> 07:29.623
in America.
That's true.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.885
Boring!

07:30.928 --> 07:32.277
Thor tell better story

07:32.321 --> 07:33.278
of time
he battled

07:33.322 --> 07:34.323
pack of wolves.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.803
- But it's not squash.
- No.

07:35.846 --> 07:36.760
That's a common
misconception.
Mm-hmm.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.109
She-wolf
lunge at Thor.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.503
Thor grab she-wolf
by neck,

07:40.547 --> 07:41.722
gouge eyes
and then punch

07:41.765 --> 07:43.767
in genital!

07:43.811 --> 07:45.247
...any other sports. <i>Mm.</i>

07:45.290 --> 07:46.988
I'm sorry.
Is it my drinking?

07:47.031 --> 07:48.250
Am I overdoing it?

07:48.293 --> 07:49.860
I told you, honey,
people notice.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.906
Oh, no, no, I just had
an itch on my neck.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.560
If anything, you're
not drinking enough.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.866
Little more?

07:55.997 --> 07:58.129
Thor! No one
at a classy dinner party

07:58.173 --> 07:59.696
wants to hear
about you murdering

07:59.740 --> 08:01.219
- a pack of wolves!
Tell me more

08:01.263 --> 08:02.264
about pickleball.

08:02.307 --> 08:03.657
Cammy MacGregor,
Tyson McGuffin--

08:03.700 --> 08:05.354
these are some
- of the giants of the sport.
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.397 --> 08:07.661
Not literal giants,
of course.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.751
Height is a huge
disadvantage

08:10.794 --> 08:12.013
in pickleball...

08:12.056 --> 08:13.493
Psst. Hey. Hetty.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.495
Not on the list. Security?

08:15.538 --> 08:17.671
[groans]...because of the height
of the net and...

08:17.714 --> 08:19.586
- Sorry.
- I-I'm actually here for Trevor.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.370
The poor guy
seems really torn up.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.806
Now, I know Hetty said no,

08:22.850 --> 08:24.547
- but what do you think, Sam?
- Uh, which is often

08:24.591 --> 08:26.331
mispronounced as "bad-mitten."Mm.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.898
Silent "N"?
Sam.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.378
No, no.
Oh, no,
can she not hear us anymore?

08:29.421 --> 08:30.727
- Hey, Sam?
- No silent "N."

08:30.771 --> 08:33.034
- Sam?! Sam!
- Uh, but, uh...

08:33.077 --> 08:34.296
Enough.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.994
Of sitting around
this table. Am I right?

08:37.038 --> 08:39.954
Jay, why don't you take
our guests for a tour?

08:39.997 --> 08:41.346
Okay.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.522
Yeah.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.524
Huh, it's a little bit
weird, but...

08:44.567 --> 08:46.700
it was an awfully creamy
bisque.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.223
Just follow me
this way

08:48.266 --> 08:51.182
and we'll walk that cream
right off.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.534
Okay, you guys have to
behave. There is a lot

08:54.577 --> 08:56.361
riding on this dinner for us.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.493
Like what?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.016
Details aren't important.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.149
Maybe we get
general area?

09:01.192 --> 09:03.760
Fine. We have to
win over the Farnsbys

09:03.804 --> 09:05.501
so they give us a permit
to open our B and B.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.286
But we don't want the B and B.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.680
I know. That's why
I was hiding it from you.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.161
A few guests at a dinner
party, we can deal with.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.466
But a full hotel?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.468
My God, that'd be chaos.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.948
Oh, I wasn't thinking
it'd be anything like that.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.428
I thought
it'd be small and quaint,

09:19.471 --> 09:20.777
like the inn on <i>Newhart.</i>

09:20.821 --> 09:22.039
Is that what
you were thinking, Sam?

09:22.083 --> 09:23.563
I don't know what <i>Newhart</i> is,

09:23.606 --> 09:25.042
but I like
that you're on my side.

09:25.086 --> 09:28.176
Really? Delightful sitcom
about a stammering innkeeper?

09:28.219 --> 09:30.395
Nothing? It was
really popular in the '80s.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.223
I wasn't even alive
in the '80s, Pete.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.617
Well, I'm not alive now
but I still love <i>Newhart.</i>

09:34.661 --> 09:36.619
We don't want hotel!

09:36.663 --> 09:37.620
- Absolutely not.
- Mm-mm. No.

09:37.664 --> 09:38.795
Well, you should want hotel,

09:38.839 --> 09:40.667
because no hotel, no me.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.146
Who helps you watch TV?

09:42.930 --> 09:44.888
Who is writing your memoir?

09:44.932 --> 09:47.412
Well, actually, on that,
I do have a few notes.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.762
If we can't build the B and B,

09:48.805 --> 09:50.111
we're gonna have
to sell this place.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.765
And God knows who would buy it.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.984
Certainly not somebody
who can actually see you

09:54.028 --> 09:56.552
and do things for you and help
make your afterlives better.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.293
So unless you
want to throw

09:58.336 --> 09:59.642
all that away,

09:59.686 --> 10:00.861
I'm gonna need your help.

10:00.904 --> 10:01.905
All right. We will help,

10:01.949 --> 10:04.125
but it will be begrudgingly.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.302
Well?

10:07.345 --> 10:08.346
It was a hard no.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.087
You're still
not invited.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.262
Ugh. Bummer.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.524
Come on.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.178
Trevor, you are
not taking this well, huh?

10:14.222 --> 10:17.312
Okay, look,
I never told anyone this, but...

10:17.355 --> 10:20.663
in 1999, I was left off
the guest list

10:20.707 --> 10:24.188
for a Fourth of July party
on a yacht.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.842
There were <i>Maxim</i> models there.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.365
There was...

10:27.409 --> 10:30.368
a vodka luge
that looked like cleavage.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.327
And I heard

10:32.370 --> 10:33.676
that a guy from Bear Stearns

10:33.720 --> 10:36.679
made out
with Natasha Henstridge.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.901
That could've been me, Pete.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.511
That could've been me.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.035
Trevor,
I did not understand that story

10:45.079 --> 10:46.515
or the points you were making,

10:46.558 --> 10:47.995
but I am so sorry.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.301
Being left out hurts.

10:50.345 --> 10:53.000
One time, my throuple
made love without me.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.871
Just the two of them.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.526
How does that even work?

10:57.569 --> 10:59.833
Okay, guys, this isn't over.

10:59.876 --> 11:00.964
<i>If you like</i>

11:01.008 --> 11:02.923
ordinance 6.B.12,
you are going

11:02.966 --> 11:06.317
to love
ordinance 6.B.13.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.493
- I'm at the edge of my seat.
- Makes two of us.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.844
Oh, gadzooks,
what a couple of lickspittles.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.193
Excuse me,

11:12.236 --> 11:13.847
didn't Sam instruct us
to clam up our kissers?

11:13.890 --> 11:14.978
Yes.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.153
If I can reserve comment

11:16.197 --> 11:17.502
on Sam's whorish lipstick,
the rest of you

11:17.546 --> 11:18.721
can hold your tongues.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.984
...to smaller lots
and-and...

11:22.290 --> 11:23.944
Uh, everything all right?

11:23.987 --> 11:26.860
Yes. I-I was just
checking my makeup,

11:26.903 --> 11:28.688
which, if anything,

11:28.731 --> 11:31.212
is conservative by
today's standards.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.824
Let's say I want to turn
the garage into a man cave.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.740
Now, that is a very
- interesting question.
- Mm.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.308
Uh, the garage constitutes
an existing structure,

11:40.351 --> 11:42.658
the demolition of which
is strictly prohibited.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.965
But, uh, making changes
to the interior,

11:45.008 --> 11:49.360
that only requires permission
from the M.R.S. department.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.841
M.R.S.?The missus.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.539
Oh!

11:56.672 --> 12:00.415
No dinner, no peace!

12:00.458 --> 12:01.372
We're crashing
the party!

12:01.416 --> 12:02.547
Oh, God, no.

12:02.591 --> 12:03.766
What is the meaning of this,
showing up

12:03.810 --> 12:05.246
to a dinner party uninvited?
Thorfinn.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.857
Hey, man, this is
a nonviolent protest.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.120
- Not anymore. Come here.
- Hey, hey.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.079
Ooh, that looks yummy. Are you
gonna finish smelling that?

12:12.122 --> 12:13.776
I'm gonna make you
my little farm boy!

12:13.820 --> 12:16.692
Well, if everybody's
just doing what they want...

12:16.736 --> 12:18.868
Thor,

12:18.912 --> 12:21.001
you're making
them look... Sam? Sam.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.393
...so crazy!

12:22.437 --> 12:25.614
...any changes you like
to the interior of, uh...

12:25.657 --> 12:28.399
Oh! His teeth are so sharp!

12:28.443 --> 12:30.358
Hallway now!

12:30.401 --> 12:32.577
Jay, can we please meet
up in the hallway now?

12:32.621 --> 12:33.709
We need to check
the breaker.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.842
These lights are
acting up. Excuse us.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.931
Yeah. S-- sorry.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.411
<i>Okay,</i>

12:40.455 --> 12:42.805
I'm gonna put this
plainly for all of you.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.982
You need to back off and let us
have our dinner party in peace.

12:46.026 --> 12:48.245
Oh, yeah!
It's definitely the breaker!

12:48.289 --> 12:49.464
Samantha, I must protest.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.595
We have just as
much of a right

12:50.639 --> 12:52.293
to attend this
dinner party as you.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.295
No. Because this
is our house.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.775
We've been here longer
than you.

12:55.818 --> 12:56.776
Yeah, and
guess what--

12:56.819 --> 12:58.038
we're alive.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.213
Hey.
Ooh.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.736
Alive?
Ouch.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.608
Didn't expect you
to drop the A-word on us.

13:03.652 --> 13:04.609
Not cool.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.263
She is worse than wolf.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.309
No, it... it wasn't supposed...

13:08.352 --> 13:09.789
This is not the kind of thing
that would ever happen

13:09.832 --> 13:11.747
on <i>Newhart.
It was gentle humor.</i>

13:11.791 --> 13:14.184
Never at anyone's expense.
Never mean.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.620
Unlike some people.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.846
...and may I just say,
your duck was fantastic.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.370
You may. And you
may say it again.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.765
Jay, I feel terrible
about the ghosts.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.288
I know. You'll fix it
later, okay?

13:31.332 --> 13:32.637
- Eyes on the prize.
- Okay.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.769
Should I open
another one?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.249
- Ooh!
- Oh, I don't know.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.033
If I let Margie
have another glass,

13:37.077 --> 13:38.948
I might have to leave
- her here overnight.
- Oh.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.167
Fine with me.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.777
Zing.
Ah, ha-ha!

13:41.821 --> 13:43.866
Oh, we're having
such a good time.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.172
This is so fun. And...

13:45.215 --> 13:47.174
and while we're
having so much fun,

13:47.217 --> 13:48.828
I was hoping
maybe we could revisit

13:48.871 --> 13:50.438
that little zoning issue.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.656
Uh, you guys are fun.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.310
Maybe too much fun?

13:53.354 --> 13:54.398
Excuse me?

13:54.442 --> 13:55.704
This is a quiet community.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.358
We like quiet people.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.229
The last thing
we need is

13:59.273 --> 14:01.710
some raucous hotel
hosting pool parties

14:01.753 --> 14:03.538
and midnight raves.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.540
That's great, because that's
not at all what we're planning.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.934
No, no! We're not even
thinking of this as a hotel.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.153
It'll be more like
a-a quaint B and B.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.286
It's a few guests.
- It's a few families.
- Mm.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.854
It's gonna be very,
very wholesome.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.333
Says Mr. Earrings.

14:19.119 --> 14:21.164
It'll be like <i>Newhart.</i>

14:23.384 --> 14:24.689
Whoa.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.343
You know <i>Newhart?</i>

14:26.387 --> 14:27.649
Yeah.

14:27.692 --> 14:30.260
I guess you could say
I know my favorite show.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.132
I thought it was <i>
Sex and the City.</i>

14:32.175 --> 14:33.742
- Talk about a finale.
- Oh.

14:33.785 --> 14:34.874
Oh. I could.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.571
- All day.
- Favorite episode?

14:36.614 --> 14:38.442
You-you go first.
Uh...

14:38.486 --> 14:42.011
I will. As soon as
I go to the bathroom.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.926
And you go.
Separately.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.928
But I know his
schedule.
Mm.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.408
- Me, too.

14:47.451 --> 14:50.193
Uh... yep.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.544
Please, Pete,
I need your <i>Newhart</i> knowledge.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.634
Is a sentence my wife just said
to an invisible person.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.984
I want to help, but...

14:58.027 --> 14:59.768
I got to stick
with my troop on this one.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.422
Please, please, please,
please, please, please?

15:01.465 --> 15:03.946
Seriously, man? You
just told us to get lost.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.470
Now she's begging
for reinforcements,

15:06.514 --> 15:09.343
like she's William Howe
at the Battle of White Plains.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.389
No? No? No White Plains

15:12.433 --> 15:14.261
aficionados -in the house?
I love White Plains.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.828
Went to Laurie Schender's
bat mitzvah there in '82.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.308
Pretty exclusive invite,
by the way.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.615
The kid from <i>Silver Spoons
was there.</i>

15:20.658 --> 15:22.443
I feel terrible. I-I
mean, I know it seems

15:22.486 --> 15:24.619
like I'm just saying that now
because I need your help.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.099
But I felt bad
before.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.796
Jay can back me up.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.538
Uh, yep. She felt
really bad, people.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.281
- Like that's worth a damn.
- These nights are
a big deal for us.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.109
It's our chance
to feel human again,

15:36.152 --> 15:37.719
even if it's only
for a few hours.

15:37.762 --> 15:40.504
But after tonight, a lot of us
are feeling less alive

15:40.548 --> 15:41.984
than we ever have.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.334
Look, I haven't been around
as long as you guys.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.554
And, apparently,
I still have a lot to learn.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.992
Because this isn't my house.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.515
This is our house.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.344
Do you really mean that,
Samantha?

15:55.084 --> 15:56.564
I really do.

15:56.607 --> 15:57.782
I take it back.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.088
She less bad
than wolf.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.524
Thank you, Thorfinn.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.265
And whether you guys want
to help or not,

16:02.309 --> 16:05.181
I want you to come back
and join us for dessert.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.835
- All of you.
- Oh!
Yes!

16:06.878 --> 16:08.837
- All right.
- T-Money back
in the game.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.144
Well, I suppose we accept.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.537
<i>Now, something people don't know</i>

16:13.581 --> 16:15.496
is that the show's
opening credits... Now, something people don't know

16:15.539 --> 16:17.411
is that the show's
opening credits......were filmed in New Hampshire.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.890
...were filmed
- in New Hampshire.
- Even though, as everyone...

16:18.934 --> 16:20.457
Even though,
as we all know,

16:20.501 --> 16:22.720
the show took place
in rural Vermont.

16:22.764 --> 16:23.983
You weren't kidding.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.420
You know your <i>Newhart.
I am impressed.</i>

16:26.463 --> 16:28.639
Most people your age
have absolutely

16:28.683 --> 16:30.641
no appreciation for
classic television.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.166
No, and forget
about art... Ah.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.168
...wine, cinema,

16:35.211 --> 16:36.865
wine, jazz...

16:36.908 --> 16:39.389
Oh, jazz,
we love jazz.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.087
If I had to name my
favorite artists...

16:41.130 --> 16:42.523
Sidney Bechet,
Fletcher Henderson.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.568
...Sidney Bechet,
Fletcher Henderson.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.875
Louis Armstrong.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.920
What? You talk,
I listen.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.531
Amazing. It is so rare

16:50.574 --> 16:52.272
to find someone
who has an appreciation

16:52.315 --> 16:54.230
for anything
that came before them.

16:54.274 --> 16:57.059
Well, that's the problem
- with young people today.
- Well, that's the problem

16:57.103 --> 16:58.321
with young people today.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.193
Y-Yes. Exactly. Exactly!

17:00.236 --> 17:01.977
- Exactly.
- Exactly!

17:02.021 --> 17:03.109
Exactly.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.240
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.547
Young people are the worst.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.550
- That was incredible.
- Right?

17:09.593 --> 17:11.900
Call me crazy,
but this might actually work.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.075
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait,

17:13.119 --> 17:14.598
weren't there a lot more
of those before?

17:14.642 --> 17:15.686
Um...

17:15.730 --> 17:16.731
How many
of those have you had today?

17:16.774 --> 17:18.254
Uh, he had
at least four.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.081
One?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.343
Cupcake Bogarter.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.824
They're telling
on me, aren't they?

17:22.867 --> 17:24.304
I can't live like this.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.828
- I have an idea.
- Mm-hmm.

17:26.871 --> 17:30.005
How about a morning game
of pickleball?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
Uh, I don't think so.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.487
Oh, come on, dear.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.576
If we're not going to use
the court, then why on earth

17:35.619 --> 17:37.926
did we tear down the
carriage house to build it?

17:37.969 --> 17:39.319
Wait, tear down
the carriage house?

17:39.362 --> 17:40.798
- Did you hear that?
Ooh.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.670
Coffee and
cupcakes.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.846
Margaret,
these look delicious.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.761
So, just between
the four of us...

17:46.804 --> 17:48.545
"And my other brother
Darryl." Just say it.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.720
And my other brother Darryl.

17:49.764 --> 17:50.852
Oh!

17:50.895 --> 17:52.288
There's got to be

17:52.332 --> 17:54.160
something we can do
about this zoning issue, right?

17:54.203 --> 17:55.248
Jay,

17:55.291 --> 17:57.859
Samantha, I am man
enough to admit

17:57.902 --> 17:59.687
when I have
missed the mark.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.080
How 'bout this?

18:01.123 --> 18:03.038
I'll push through
the permits.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.474
Serious?

18:04.518 --> 18:06.868
Oh, my God.
- That's amazing.
- In exchange

18:06.911 --> 18:10.132
for a small donation to the
Historical Preservation Fund.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.960
Excuse me?

18:12.003 --> 18:14.180
H-How big a small donation?

18:14.223 --> 18:17.183
Well, a suggested
donation is $20,000.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.098
Uh, you can make
the check out to me.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.316
The scoundrel.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.449
- So baller.
- Think it over.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.191
And, uh, thank you--
here we go, Margaret...

18:25.234 --> 18:28.194
Mm-hmm. Yes....uh, for
an absolutely wonderful,

18:28.237 --> 18:29.456
wonderful evening.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.197
We will show
ourselves out.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.938
Thank you so much
for coming!

18:33.982 --> 18:35.810
I wasted the duck
on a total shakedown.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.812
We can't afford $20,000.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.030
Uh, Samantha.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.031
What?

18:40.075 --> 18:40.902
We've come across
some information

18:40.945 --> 18:42.730
on the Farnsbys.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.908
And the train goes in the
tunnel, out the other side.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.258
- Well done, well done.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey.

18:49.302 --> 18:52.479
Maybe next time we'll come
to your place for pickleball.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.307
Oh.
- Oh.
- On your home court.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.744
Where the carriage
house used to be.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.398
Wait a minute,

18:58.441 --> 19:00.226
that would violate
ordinance 6.B.13,

19:00.269 --> 19:03.751
which says you can't demolish
existing structures.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.753
Oh, chardonnay.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.450
Take that.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.409
- Checkmate.
- Oh...!Your wife is drunk.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.497
Are you trying
to use

19:10.540 --> 19:12.890
my own ordinances against me?

19:12.934 --> 19:14.065
Oh, no, no, no, no--

19:14.109 --> 19:15.632
Yes, that's exactly
what we're doing.

19:15.676 --> 19:16.677
Ooh!
- Mmm.
- Good for her.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.244
- Mmm.
- Spicy lady.

19:18.287 --> 19:22.291
Well, this would certainly be
an awkward situation...

19:22.335 --> 19:25.425
if I hadn't been completely
kidding about the donation.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.124
Congratulations

19:29.168 --> 19:30.517
on your permit.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.566
Easy on
the stairs.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.786
And we want access
to that pickleball court!

19:38.829 --> 19:41.963
- What? Why do we want that?
- I don't know.
They made it sound fun.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.791
Take that, Farnsbys!

19:43.834 --> 19:46.837
Another generation
of Woodstone prevails.

19:47.838 --> 19:51.233
And that is how we do it
in our house.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.062
Up top. No, just-just put
your hand up.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.934
Close enough.
Ooh, girl.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.067
You throw one hell
of a dinner party.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.242
Yeah, maybe next time
I'll get invited.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.765
Trevor, listen.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.550
Don't you know
that to throw

20:03.593 --> 20:05.378
a truly exclusive party,

20:05.421 --> 20:07.423
one needs a prominent snub.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.600
Of course. It's like when the
Blue Room wouldn't let Leo in.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.993
That's what put them on the map.

20:12.863 --> 20:15.126
You knew that, in this
house, I'm the Leo?

20:15.170 --> 20:16.432
Mm-hmm. You're the Leo.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.912
I'm the Leo.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.131
I'm the Leo.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.222
I am lying.
It was the pants thing.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.964
Well, I guess the ghosts spying
on us really came in handy, huh?

20:27.008 --> 20:29.140
Uh, I don't have
any personal privacy

20:29.184 --> 20:30.664
and I'm terrified to shower,

20:30.707 --> 20:32.622
but, yeah, I guess this time
they really came through.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.537
Hey, which one knew
so much about <i>Newhart?</i>

20:34.581 --> 20:36.757
- Oh, Pete.
- Oh! Arrow Guy!

20:36.800 --> 20:38.454
Way to hit the target, brother.

20:38.498 --> 20:41.718
"Arrow Guy"? Still?!
Unbelievable!
