08:31.944 --> 08:35.281
EVERYTHING SHE WANTED WAS LIKE,

08:35.348 --> 08:36.349
IT HAD TO BE A GIRL, A GIRL TOY

08:36.415 --> 08:40.419
OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING SPARKLY.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.188
>> WE USED TO CUT HER HAIR AND

08:42.255 --> 08:43.256
SHE WOULD GET SO UPSET AND IT

08:43.322 --> 08:45.024
WAS LIKE EVERYTHING TO HER WAS

08:45.091 --> 08:45.992
HAIR AND THAT WAS LIKE WHAT

08:46.058 --> 08:48.661
SIGNIFIED TO HER A GIRL.

08:48.728 --> 08:49.896
AND THEN SHE'D IMMEDIATELY COME

08:49.962 --> 08:51.264
HOME AND FIND A PAIR OF PAJAMA

08:51.330 --> 08:52.565
PANTS STICK IT ON HER HEAD, THE

08:52.632 --> 08:53.699
WAIST ON HER HEAD FOR THE LEGS

08:53.766 --> 08:55.134
TO COME DOWN LIKE HAIR.

08:55.201 --> 08:55.768
>> Shangela: REALLY?

08:55.835 --> 09:00.506

09:02.375 --> 09:03.576
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU KNOW JUST

KIND OF MAYBE GOING THROUGH A

09:06.012 --> 09:06.779
LIKES THAT KIND OF STUFF, THAT'S

09:06.846 --> 09:07.213
FINE.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.714

09:16.222 --> 09:17.456
YOU SAY NO TO YOUR CHILD WHEN

09:17.523 --> 09:19.692
THEY'RE TELLING YOU EXACTLY WHO

09:19.759 --> 09:21.627
THEY ARE?

09:21.694 --> 09:23.162
SO, ALL RIGHT, LET'S ROLL

09:23.229 --> 09:23.996

09:24.063 --> 09:24.730
>> Shangela: DID YOU GROW UP

09:24.797 --> 09:25.364
AROUND ANY QUEER PEOPLE, ANY GAY

09:25.431 --> 09:26.032

09:38.945 --> 09:39.545
BE EASY FOR HER.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.380
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY FOR HER.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.116
AND I AM HERE TO PROTECT HER.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.584
I KNEW THAT I WAS GONNA HAVE TO

09:45.651 --> 09:47.386
STEP UP BECAUSE I'M A MOM AND

09:47.453 --> 09:49.422
THAT'S WHAT MOMS ARE SUPPOSED TO

09:49.488 --> 09:50.056
DO, BECAUSE THEY LOVE THEIR

09:50.122 --> 09:51.691
CHILDREN UNCONDITIONALLY.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.492
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT I MEAN AS

09:53.559 --> 09:55.428
FAR AS AFFIRMING PARENTS GO,

09:55.494 --> 09:57.129
WE'RE A MINORITY.

09:57.196 --> 09:58.397
>> Shangela: WELL YOU KNOW WHAT,

WE ARE GONNA BE LISTENING TO

09:59.265 --> 10:00.533

10:10.943 --> 10:12.278
HAS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT DOING

10:12.345 --> 10:13.312

10:13.379 --> 10:16.015
IN THE FLORIDA PUBLIC SCHOOL

10:16.082 --> 10:17.283
SYSTEM, AND RIGHT NOW IT'S

10:17.350 --> 10:18.751

ANYTHING GAY.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.487
WELL, BEING A PART OF OUR SHOW

10:28.194 --> 10:29.628
TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS SHOW CUZ

WORRIED SO I WENT OUT WITH A

21:54.980 --> 21:58.116
FLASHLIGHT LOOKING FOR HER AND

21:58.183 --> 22:00.719
SHE WAS SITTING UNDERNEATH A

22:00.786 --> 22:04.456
TREE WITH A ROPE AND A NOOSE

22:04.523 --> 22:08.827
LAYING BESIDE HER AND SHE SAID I

22:08.894 --> 22:09.895
COULDN'T FIND A BRANCH, AND I

22:09.961 --> 22:12.964
JUST SAT DOWN THERE WITH HER AND

22:13.031 --> 22:14.966
I SAID THIS IS IT, YOU HAVE TO

22:15.033 --> 22:15.600
TRANSITION, AND I'M HERE FOR YOU

22:15.667 --> 22:17.602
AND WE'LL DO THIS.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.438
>> Eureka: WOW.

22:19.504 --> 22:19.971
>> SO...

22:20.038 --> 22:20.972
>> SHE SAVED MY LIFE.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.075
ABSOLUTELY SAVED MY LIFE.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.510
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY COULD

22:25.577 --> 22:28.313
EVER FEEL THE GRATITUDE AND THE

22:28.380 --> 22:30.115
LOVE FOR A PERSON THAT, THAT

22:30.182 --> 22:34.453
REALLY SAVES YOUR LIFE.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.989
>> UNTIL I ACTUALLY STARTED THE

22:38.056 --> 22:41.793
TRANSITIONING AND BECAME ME, I

22:41.860 --> 22:42.928
WANTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE, AND I

22:42.994 --> 22:43.595
HEAR THAT FROM A LOT OF

22:43.662 --> 22:44.196
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY

22:44.262 --> 22:47.099
YOUNG PEOPLE.

22:47.165 --> 22:49.534
THE MORE WE CAN PUT OUT THERE AS

22:49.601 --> 22:52.337
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND BE VOCAL

22:52.404 --> 22:54.005
ABOUT WHO WE ARE, THAT WILL HELP

22:54.072 --> 22:56.942
THE KIDS THAT ARE FOLLOWING US.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.376
>> BUT IT, IT'S, IT'S BEEN A,

22:58.443 --> 22:59.344
IT'S BEEN A TRANSITION FOR US

22:59.411 --> 23:02.848
BOTH.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.117
WE TALKED ABOUT DIVORCE FROM

23:05.183 --> 23:08.186
TIME TO TIME, BUT I FIGURED THAT

23:08.253 --> 23:09.621
I LOVE THIS PERSON NO MATTER

23:09.688 --> 23:15.160
WHAT THE GENDER.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.461
>> AND THEN WE STARTED CHASING

23:16.528 --> 23:19.531
EACH OTHER AROUND THE HOUSE.

23:19.598 --> 23:20.165
>> NO, THEN, THEN, THEN

23:20.232 --> 23:21.133
WE STARTED GOING SHOPPING.

23:21.199 --> 23:21.967
>> Eureka: I LOVE THAT.

23:22.033 --> 23:22.701
>> WE DID; WE BECAME

23:22.768 --> 23:24.169
FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD KIDS.

23:24.236 --> 23:24.870
>> Eureka: SO IT WAS JUST NIGHT

23:24.936 --> 23:26.004
AND DAY DIFFERENT?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.506
>> OH YEAH, IT WAS, YOU KNOW.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.107
>> I CAN'T EVEN, I CAN'T EVEN

23:29.174 --> 23:31.309
BEGIN TO SAY THAT THIS IS A

23:31.376 --> 23:35.380
TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.549
>> WHEN I WALKED OUT THE FIRST

23:37.616 --> 23:39.785
TIME AND GOT IN THE CAR AS ME, I

23:39.851 --> 23:42.154
WAS ECSTATIC AND I WAS LIKE, OH

23:42.220 --> 23:47.793
YOU'RE PRETTY.

23:47.859 --> 23:48.727
[LAUGHTER]

23:48.794 --> 23:50.128
>> Eureka: GOOD.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.263
>> Eureka: MANDY'S STORY TOUCHED

23:51.329 --> 23:52.430
ME IN SUCH A WAY THAT I DIDN'T

23:52.497 --> 23:55.567
EXPECT IT TO TOUCH ME.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.470
I HAVE A TRANS PAST.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.839
I LITERALLY TRANSITIONED AT LIKE

24:00.906 --> 24:01.940
EIGHTEEN AND A HALF AND I LIVED

24:02.007 --> 24:02.808
AS A FEMALE TILL I WAS

24:02.874 --> 24:04.976
TWENTY-THREE.

24:05.043 --> 24:07.345
I CAN DOWN A LIST OF REASONS WHY

24:07.412 --> 24:09.181
I DECIDED TO RE-TRANSITION AND

24:09.247 --> 24:12.617
START LIVING AS A QUEER BOY AND

24:12.684 --> 24:13.752
A LOT OF IT WAS LIKE THE

24:13.819 --> 24:14.553
SOCIETAL PUSH BACK THAT I WAS

24:14.619 --> 24:17.155
GETTING, THE VERBAL ABUSE, IT

24:17.222 --> 24:18.523
JUST GOT TO A POINT WHERE I WAS

24:18.590 --> 24:20.525
LIKE AFRAID TO GO GROCERY

24:20.592 --> 24:22.327
SHOPPING, I'D ONLY GO IN THE

24:22.394 --> 24:24.229
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT LIKE WHEN NO

24:24.296 --> 24:25.463
ONE WAS THERE, BUT THEN THERE

24:25.530 --> 24:26.131
WAS THIS HUGE PART OF MY

24:26.198 --> 24:31.803
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY MOTHER.

24:31.870 --> 24:32.904
YOU KNOW, SHE DEFINITELY TREATED

24:32.971 --> 24:33.505
ME DIFFERENTLY NOW THAT I WAS

24:33.572 --> 24:35.807
TRANS.

24:35.874 --> 24:36.741
YOU KNOW, BEFORE, I WAS HER BABY

24:36.808 --> 24:38.043
BOY AND YOU KNOW EVERYONE IN MY

24:38.109 --> 24:39.578
FAMILY TREATED ME DIFFERENTLY.

24:39.644 --> 24:40.712
THERE WAS A PRESSURE OF JUST

24:40.779 --> 24:47.185
FEELING LIKE THE OUTCAST.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.320
>> Eureka: THE WORST THING THAT

24:48.386 --> 24:50.355
CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY FUELED BY

24:50.422 --> 24:52.357
FEAR AND SHAME IS YOU RUN THE

24:52.424 --> 24:54.459
RISK OF THEM CHOOSING TO LIVE A

24:54.526 --> 24:55.660
CERTAIN WAY THAT THEY THINK THE

24:55.727 --> 24:58.430
WORLD'S GOING TO ACCEPT.

24:58.496 --> 25:03.568
BUT YOU KNOW, AT SEVENTY,

25:03.635 --> 25:04.336
BUT YOU KNOW, AT 70, MANDY'S

25:04.402 --> 25:05.871
LIVING EVERY MOMENT SHE CAN

25:05.937 --> 25:06.705
HONEY AND SHE'S MAKING SURE WE

25:06.771 --> 25:07.205
ALL KNOW IT.

25:07.272 --> 25:08.073
>> Eureka: THANK YOU FOR GIVING

25:08.139 --> 25:09.074
ME THIS MOMENT, YOU KNOW.

25:09.140 --> 25:18.316
>> YEAH.

25:18.383 --> 25:19.217
>> THERE IS A BIG DISCUSSION

25:19.284 --> 25:19.851
WHEN IT COMES TO TREATMENT FOR

25:19.918 --> 25:21.286
TRANSGENDER CHILDREN, THE

25:21.353 --> 25:24.589

25:26.691 --> 25:27.259
WANTS TO BAN TRANSGENDER CARE

25:27.325 --> 25:27.759
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.

25:27.826 --> 25:29.327
>> SOCIAL GENDER TRANSITION

25:29.394 --> 25:30.996
SHOULD NOT BE A TREATMENT OPTION

25:31.062 --> 25:33.198
FOR CHILDREN OR ADOLESCENCE.

25:50.815 --> 25:51.316
AT SCHOOL?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.751
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS?

25:52.817 --> 25:54.419
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SITUATION

25:54.486 --> 25:55.353
I'M IN.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.088
I TOLD LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF

PEOPLE THAT I'M TRANS AND THE

FIRST PERSON I TOLD UM, THEM TO

DOESN'T REALLY LIKE ME ANYMORE

26:09.367 --> 26:09.768
SO LIKE,

26:09.834 --> 26:10.368
>> SHE IS A LITTLE CONCERNED

26:10.435 --> 26:10.802
THAT THAT PERSON IS

26:10.869 --> 26:11.369
GONNA GO TELL OTHER PEOPLE.

26:11.436 --> 26:11.703
>> I'M SCARED.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.370
YEAH, BECAUSE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE

26:12.437 --> 26:12.971
LIKE TO GOSSIP AND LIKE START

26:13.038 --> 26:14.906
DRAMA.

26:14.973 --> 26:18.843
UM, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO

26:18.910 --> 26:22.314
NOT LIKE ME BUT...

26:22.380 --> 26:22.948
>> YOU ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE WHAT?

26:23.014 --> 26:23.315
ALWAYS BE YOU.

26:23.381 --> 26:23.848
>> AND DON'T LISTEN TO THE

26:23.915 --> 26:24.649
HATERS THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.

26:24.716 --> 26:25.250
>> Eureka: I LOVE THAT, CAN I

26:25.317 --> 26:25.884
GET A SMACK FOR THAT, I MEAN I'M

26:25.951 --> 26:26.451
JUST SAYING.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.052
>> Bob: IT'S REALLY COOL THAT

26:27.118 --> 26:27.686
YOU HAVE SUCH A FIERCE

26:27.752 --> 26:31.089
UNDERSTANDING OF YOURSELF AT

26:31.156 --> 26:31.523
SUCH A YOUNG AGE.

26:31.589 --> 26:32.157
>> Eureka: IT'S INSPIRING EVEN

26:32.223 --> 26:34.726
FOR ME.

26:34.793 --> 26:35.961
IT'S HARD SOMETIMES FOR A LOT OF

26:36.027 --> 26:36.695
PEOPLE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M

26:36.761 --> 26:41.833
GONNA BE ME.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.367
SO THAT'S A,

26:42.434 --> 26:42.934
>> IS IT HARD FOR YOU, YOU

26:43.001 --> 26:43.134
THINK?

26:43.201 --> 26:43.735
>> Eureka: SUPER STAR MOVE.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.203

26:45.971 --> 26:46.504
GONNA HANG OUT WITH MAMA FOR A

26:46.571 --> 26:47.005
SECOND AND THEN WE'LL,

26:47.072 --> 26:47.739
>> Bob: SHE SAID, SHE SAID I'M

26:47.806 --> 26:49.240
GETTING IN THIS BOUNCY HOUSE.

26:49.307 --> 26:50.775
>> Eureka: AND THEN SEEING THE

26:50.842 --> 26:51.977
HAPPINESS OF DEMPSEY'S FACE JUST

26:52.043 --> 26:52.544
CELEBRATE WHO SHE IS, IS

26:52.610 --> 26:55.213
INCREDIBLE.

26:55.280 --> 26:55.814
WHEN SHE TRANSITIONED DID YOU

26:55.880 --> 26:56.681
HAVE A LOT OF PUSH BACK?

26:56.748 --> 26:58.717
>> YEAH.

26:58.783 --> 27:04.756
FROM THE SCHOOL, FROM DOCTORS,

27:04.823 --> 27:05.323
IT WAS HARD, THAT'S WHY WE

27:05.390 --> 27:05.957
MOVED UP HERE, WE WERE IN MIAMI

27:06.024 --> 27:06.591
AND YOU'D THINK THAT MIAMI WOULD

27:06.658 --> 27:06.925
BE MORE OPEN.

27:06.992 --> 27:07.559
>> Shangela: SUPER PROGRESSIVE.

27:07.625 --> 27:07.959
I WOULD THINK SO.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.828
>> NO, ONLY IN THE BEACH.

27:09.894 --> 27:10.996
>> OUTSIDE THE BEACH IT'S VERY

27:11.062 --> 27:12.497
CONSERVATIVE, VERY RELIGIOUS.

27:12.564 --> 27:13.765
SO WHEN WE MOVED UP HERE WE

27:13.832 --> 27:15.834
FOUND AN AFFIRMING DOCTOR WHICH

27:15.900 --> 27:17.102
WAS AMAZING AND THAT'S THE ONLY

27:17.168 --> 27:18.036
TIME WE COULD CHANGE HER BIRTH

27:18.103 --> 27:18.603
CERTIFICATE CUZ WE NEEDED A

27:18.670 --> 27:19.637
DOCTOR.

27:19.704 --> 27:20.472
THE DOCTOR IN MIAMI, LIKE NO,

27:20.538 --> 27:21.406
THIS IS SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH

27:21.473 --> 27:23.975
YOU, YOU'RE SICK, BOTH OF YOU,

27:24.042 --> 27:25.377
ME AND MY HUSBAND, YOU'RE SICK.

27:25.443 --> 27:26.578
>> Shangela: AND THERE ARE BILLS

27:26.644 --> 27:27.412
RIGHT NOW DIRECTIVE TO DOCTORS

27:27.479 --> 27:30.181
TO NOT SUPPORT TRANSITIONING?

27:30.248 --> 27:31.116
TO NOT SUPPORT TRANSITIONING?

27:31.182 --> 27:31.516
>> SO, THEY DO NOT

27:31.583 --> 27:32.684
RECOMMEND CHILDREN TO SOCIALLY

27:32.751 --> 27:34.953
TRANSITION.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.121
THE SIMPLE GROWING YOUR HAIR AND

27:36.187 --> 27:36.988
CHANGING YOUR WARDROBE, THEY'VE

27:37.055 --> 27:38.323
SAID NO, IT'S A SCARY TIME I

27:38.390 --> 27:39.124
MEAN I, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M

27:39.190 --> 27:39.924
GONNA HAVE TO DO IF THEY TAKE

27:39.991 --> 27:41.292
AWAY HER RIGHT TO HEALTHCARE

27:41.359 --> 27:41.893
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO OUT OF

27:41.960 --> 27:43.094

27:46.464 --> 27:47.699
FLORIDA?

27:47.766 --> 27:48.333

27:49.534 --> 27:50.668

27:50.735 --> 27:53.471

27:54.072 --> 27:54.606
AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SO QUICK

27:54.672 --> 27:55.240
TO LIKE WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE

27:55.306 --> 27:55.774
THEN IF IT'S SO TERRIBLE.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.408
AND I'M LIKE BECAUSE IF EVERYONE

27:56.474 --> 27:56.975
JUST GOT UP AND LEFT WHAT IS

27:57.042 --> 28:02.781
THAT SAYING?

28:02.847 --> 28:03.915
>> HOW WAS IT?

28:03.982 --> 28:05.050
>> WE FINALLY FOUND A DOCTOR

28:05.116 --> 28:06.484
THAT'S AFFIRMING AND THE

28:06.551 --> 28:11.723
POLITICS OF THE STATE, THEY ARE

28:11.790 --> 28:12.590
ISSUING, INCH BY INCH, LAWS THAT

28:12.657 --> 28:13.224
ARE GONNA TAKE AWAY HER RIGHT TO

28:13.291 --> 28:14.993
MEDICAL CARE.

28:15.060 --> 28:15.727
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE

28:15.794 --> 28:16.161
OUT OF STATE?

28:16.227 --> 28:17.195
THAT'S A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY,

28:17.262 --> 28:17.962
IT'S ALREADY ON THAT PATH RIGHT

28:18.029 --> 28:19.531
NOW.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.433
SO THAT'S MY BIGGEST WORRY.
