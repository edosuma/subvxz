WEBVTT

00:00.047 --> 00:01.796
Previously on "Faking It"...

00:01.798 --> 00:03.634
- Felix!
- I made it home.

00:03.636 --> 00:05.324
You planned this whole party
just to avoid

00:05.326 --> 00:06.612
having sex with me?

00:06.614 --> 00:08.879
The one person I've ever
asked you to stay away from.

00:08.881 --> 00:10.473
You can never
trust a Booker.

00:10.475 --> 00:11.530
Hey, you know how you're
always wondering

00:11.532 --> 00:12.708
if you're a bad person?

00:12.710 --> 00:13.705
You are.

00:13.707 --> 00:15.936
The real you
is so fantastic.

00:15.938 --> 00:18.003
You're the best friend ever.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.373
So what did it mean?

00:23.085 --> 00:26.086
Honestly,
I have no [bleep] clue.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.933
Shane, you're supposed
to help me

00:27.935 --> 00:29.664
figure these things out.

00:29.666 --> 00:30.649
Well, I guess it's possible

00:30.651 --> 00:33.220
that Karma kissed you
because she has feelings,

00:33.222 --> 00:35.346
but on the other hand,
she was a drunk girl at a party,

00:35.348 --> 00:38.433
and kissing you for attention
is kind of what she's known for.

00:38.435 --> 00:39.568
But it was different
this time.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.175
There was no one around
when she kissed me.

00:41.177 --> 00:42.432
She didn't get
any attention.

00:42.434 --> 00:45.438
Until the lights came on
and everybody saw.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.783
Okay, there's no use
trying to analyze it.

00:47.785 --> 00:49.815
Let's just wait
and see what Karma says

00:49.817 --> 00:50.767
when she wakes up.

00:53.157 --> 00:54.970
Sorry, I couldn't wait.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.374
Hey, Karma.
How are you feeling?

00:56.376 --> 00:57.737
My head.

00:57.739 --> 01:00.736
It's like my brain's
trying to escape my skull

01:00.738 --> 01:02.487
through my eyeballs.

01:02.489 --> 01:04.232
Babe, that's called
a hangover.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.755
Okay, but how are you
feeling about...

01:06.757 --> 01:09.070
What you did?

01:10.125 --> 01:12.049
Oh, my God.

01:12.051 --> 01:14.836
I let the soccer team
lick salt off my stomach.

01:14.838 --> 01:15.777
And then?

01:15.779 --> 01:18.457
And then, oh,
I danced on a table.

01:18.459 --> 01:20.017
Uh-huh, and?

01:20.019 --> 01:21.260
And my nipples were showing.

01:21.262 --> 01:22.567
After that.

01:22.569 --> 01:24.536
After that...

01:27.791 --> 01:30.041
After that, it's blank.

01:36.934 --> 01:38.722
Farrah and Daddy could
be home any second.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.753
Scrub faster!

01:39.755 --> 01:41.655
I wouldn't be
scrubbing carpet barf

01:41.657 --> 01:44.306
if you hadn't invited
Tommy over to have sex.

01:44.308 --> 01:45.192
Hope it was worth it.

01:45.194 --> 01:47.502
That is none of your business.

01:47.504 --> 01:49.095
Unless you want
to discuss your drunken

01:49.097 --> 01:50.464
pool shenanigans with Karma.

01:51.101 --> 01:54.416
- Girls, we're home.
- Hey.

01:54.418 --> 01:56.012
- There they are.
- Hey.

01:56.014 --> 01:56.883
How was your trip?

01:56.885 --> 01:59.947
Well, it was exactly
what we needed.

01:59.949 --> 02:02.563
I feel like this weekend,
for the first time,

02:02.565 --> 02:03.961
we truly connected.

02:03.963 --> 02:05.745
And we made a decision that

02:05.747 --> 02:07.807
we're both really happy with.

02:07.809 --> 02:10.824
We're getting a divorce.

02:10.826 --> 02:11.332
What?

02:11.334 --> 02:14.063
We just rushed into marriage
way too fast.

02:14.065 --> 02:15.497
We're sorry to have
dragged you two into this.

02:15.499 --> 02:17.609
Hey, look at the bright side.
Now we can move back to Dallas,

02:17.611 --> 02:20.141
just like you always
wanted, sug-plum.

02:20.143 --> 02:22.249
You're just gonna take
her back to Dallas?

02:22.251 --> 02:23.192
She has a whole life here.

02:23.194 --> 02:24.787
Can't she stay
through graduation?

02:24.789 --> 02:26.014
Of course.

02:26.016 --> 02:27.766
Lauren.

02:27.768 --> 02:30.597
No matter what happens between
your dad and me,

02:30.599 --> 02:33.271
you will always be
the daughter I never had.

02:33.273 --> 02:34.866
You're welcome to stay here

02:34.868 --> 02:37.158
with us if that's what you want.

02:44.535 --> 02:45.518
Good morning.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.932
Hey, thanks.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.630
And thanks again
for letting me couch crash.

02:49.632 --> 02:51.630
Oh, please, you had
nowhere else to go,

02:51.632 --> 02:54.492
and I am a friend
to the homeless.

02:54.494 --> 02:56.261
Well, at least the ones
that look like you.

02:57.551 --> 03:01.673
So, Karma and Amy
swapped spit in the pool.

03:01.675 --> 03:03.956
The plot thickens.
What do you think it meant?

03:03.958 --> 03:06.445
- Don't know, don't care.
- Really?

03:06.447 --> 03:08.749
No, I'm too upset
about my fight with Shane.

03:08.751 --> 03:11.184
He called me
a [bleep] Booker.

03:11.186 --> 03:12.123
Wow.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.213
How dare he... call you
by your last name.

03:15.215 --> 03:17.380
A Booker is a rich,
self-involved [bleep]

03:17.382 --> 03:19.381
who uses money
to get what they want.

03:19.383 --> 03:21.082
Uh-oh, I think I'm a Booker.

03:21.084 --> 03:22.591
No, you're a good person.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.586
Eh, sometimes.

03:24.588 --> 03:26.401
You're way better
at that than me.

03:26.403 --> 03:28.237
It's probably 'cause
you're only half-Booker.

03:28.239 --> 03:30.062
I bet your real dad
is out there somewhere

03:30.064 --> 03:33.020
doing God's work as a Rabbi
or a teacher

03:33.022 --> 03:34.569
or a plastic surgeon.

03:34.571 --> 03:36.546
Or sitting on the mountains
of cash that my family

03:36.548 --> 03:38.677
must have paid him
to disappear.

03:38.679 --> 03:43.882
Look, I appreciate the chat,
but I'm late for school.

03:43.884 --> 03:44.918
Have a good day.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.219
Yeah, you too.

03:47.221 --> 03:49.446
I can't believe
you're even considering this.

03:49.448 --> 03:51.878
So I'm supposed
to just abandon my dad

03:51.880 --> 03:53.889
to live with
my cheating ex-stepmom?

03:53.891 --> 03:56.855
Yes. Think about
what you'd be leaving behind.

03:56.857 --> 03:59.108
Like my life here
is so great.

03:59.110 --> 04:01.824
I fell in love with a guy
who turned out to be a narc.

04:01.826 --> 04:04.659
I'm only class president
because I'm... different.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.876
So different, in fact,

04:05.878 --> 04:09.034
that Tommy was too scared
to have sex with me.

04:09.036 --> 04:10.324
Tommy's an idiot.

04:10.326 --> 04:11.872
Everyone at Hester
accepts you.

04:11.874 --> 04:14.728
Lauren, do you really
think you're gonna

04:14.730 --> 04:16.423
find that back in Dallas?

04:16.426 --> 04:18.932
Back in Dallas,
nobody knows.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.678 --> 04:32.165
Remember, I will have eyes
on you at all times.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.612
Miss Raudenfeld.

04:33.614 --> 04:38.248
I hope that party
of yours was worth it.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.332
Felix, what happened to you?

04:39.334 --> 04:42.266
Uh, well, I kind of had too much
to drink at your party

04:42.268 --> 04:45.059
and wrecked my dad's car.

04:45.061 --> 04:46.726
Oh, Felix.

04:46.728 --> 04:48.467
I'm so glad you're okay.

04:48.469 --> 04:49.744
God, no wonder
he was pissed.

04:49.746 --> 04:50.803
Yeah, he'll calm
down, though,

04:50.805 --> 04:54.301
as soon as
I'm safely back in rehab.

04:54.303 --> 04:58.216
Back?

04:58.218 --> 05:01.086
Hi, my name's Felix,
and I am an alcoholic.

05:01.088 --> 05:03.224
Okay, now you say,
"Hi, Felix."

05:03.226 --> 05:05.173
But you're 16.

05:05.175 --> 05:07.136
What can I say?
I'm an overachiever.

05:07.138 --> 05:10.067
Plus my mom was one too,
so basically last night

05:10.069 --> 05:12.711
was my dad's worst
nightmare come true.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.289
You got drunk at a party
at my house.

05:15.291 --> 05:15.973
I'm so sorry.

05:15.975 --> 05:18.766
Hey, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

05:18.768 --> 05:21.260
I tend to spill my guts
when I'm wasted.

05:21.262 --> 05:22.453
It's okay.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.557
People do crazy things
when they're drunk.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.885
Well, in my experience,
drunk people say and do

05:28.887 --> 05:32.584
the things they wish they
could do when they're sober.

05:32.586 --> 05:34.059
- They do?
- Yeah.

05:34.061 --> 05:39.344
Like, I meant it when
I said I really like you.

05:39.346 --> 05:40.759
I like you, too.

05:44.618 --> 05:48.381
So, will I be seeing you
back at Hester next year?

05:48.383 --> 05:49.551
Who knows?

05:49.553 --> 05:52.804
Right now, I'm just taking it
one day at a time.

06:03.784 --> 06:07.736
Bye, Amy.

06:07.738 --> 06:09.204
Bye.

06:09.206 --> 06:10.653
Here you go.

06:13.293 --> 06:14.709
Oh, Liam.

06:14.711 --> 06:18.016
Look, I just wanted to apologize
about the other night.

06:18.018 --> 06:20.922
I'll admit, I haven't been
myself since our breakup,

06:20.924 --> 06:23.050
but I crossed a line
at the party.

06:23.052 --> 06:26.171
Many, many lines.

06:26.173 --> 06:28.056
I know I snapped at you.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.109
Is... is there something else?

06:30.111 --> 06:33.218
Oh, I don't know.
How about that kiss?

06:33.220 --> 06:34.679
Oh, my God,
I kissed you?

06:34.681 --> 06:35.923
- Karma...
- I'm so sorry.

06:35.925 --> 06:36.981
I was really drunk,

06:36.983 --> 06:39.904
and I wasn't trying to get
back together or anything.

06:39.906 --> 06:41.945
Can we just pretend
it didn't happen?

06:41.947 --> 06:44.237
- It didn't happen.
- Thank you.

06:44.239 --> 06:45.731
No, Karma,
you didn't kiss me.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.637
You kissed Amy.

06:47.639 --> 06:48.740
I what?

06:53.042 --> 06:56.225
Today is
Hester's last day of school forever.

06:56.227 --> 06:58.124
That's right, I give up.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.013
I have tried
to save you from yourselves,

07:00.015 --> 07:02.886
but you have remained
academically undisciplined,

07:02.888 --> 07:05.720
reckless, and a bad influence
on each other.

07:05.722 --> 07:08.307
You have left me no choice.

07:08.309 --> 07:09.584
At tomorrow's board meeting...

07:09.586 --> 07:10.564
- What?
- I am recommending that

07:10.566 --> 07:15.027
Hester be closed and that you
all be assigned to new schools

07:15.029 --> 07:17.695
before you can do
any more damage.

07:17.697 --> 07:20.103
What are you going
to do about this, Lauren?

07:20.105 --> 07:22.759
Nothing.
Not my school, not my problem.

07:22.761 --> 07:24.311
I'm going back to Dallas.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.824
Leila, Lisbeth.

07:26.826 --> 07:29.504
She didn't even
sign my yearbook.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.466
Turner's shutting
down the school?

07:32.468 --> 07:33.654
We need to do something
about this.

07:33.656 --> 07:36.078
We need to talk
about that kiss.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.380
So you remembered?

07:38.382 --> 07:43.810
I know what you're thinking,
and you're totally right.

07:43.812 --> 07:44.434
I am?

07:44.436 --> 07:46.473
I am the worst
best friend ever.

07:46.475 --> 07:48.947
I am so, so sorry.

07:48.949 --> 07:50.713
You were there for me when
I was spinning out, and I go

07:50.715 --> 07:53.512
and I do the worst thing
I could possibly do.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.807
I wish I could
take it back.

07:54.809 --> 07:56.348
I don't know
what I was thinking.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.583
That's what I figured.

07:57.585 --> 08:00.489
But listen, I promise
I'm gonna make it up to you.

08:00.491 --> 08:02.270
This is gonna be the summer
of Karma and Amy.

08:02.272 --> 08:04.103
Three months together
to get back on track.

08:04.105 --> 08:06.859
No Liam, no Reagan,
just us.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.328
After we find a way
to keep Hester open.

08:09.330 --> 08:11.108
Because we're spending
the rest of our lives together,

08:11.110 --> 08:13.615
and that includes
school days, right?

08:15.588 --> 08:18.334
According to my intel,
the school board's divided.

08:18.336 --> 08:19.786
We can still win this.

08:19.788 --> 08:23.215
If we can convince Mina Daniels
to vote in our favor,

08:23.217 --> 08:24.482
Hester is saved.

08:24.484 --> 08:26.680
As the leaders of the school's
most powerful clubs...

08:26.682 --> 08:28.006
Ahem.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.902
And sports.

08:30.904 --> 08:32.549
We need to come up with a plan.

08:32.551 --> 08:34.434
Great exposish, Wend.
I'll take it from here.

08:34.437 --> 08:35.245
So, first...

08:35.246 --> 08:37.414
Whoa, whoa.
Who put you in charge, Shane?

08:37.416 --> 08:38.692
You're not even in any clubs.

08:38.693 --> 08:41.356
But I've known Turner
was bad news from the beginning.

08:41.357 --> 08:43.306
I was the only one
to get naked in protest.

08:43.308 --> 08:44.395
What's your plan?

08:44.397 --> 08:46.507
Get dirt on the swing vote,
threaten to out her?

08:46.509 --> 08:48.182
Well, yeah.
What's yours?

08:48.184 --> 08:48.910
Bang her sister?

08:48.912 --> 08:50.626
No.

08:50.628 --> 08:52.427
We should organize
a peaceful protest

08:52.429 --> 08:53.828
at tomorrow's board meeting.

08:53.830 --> 08:56.988
Non-violent social justice
is what Hester is all about.

08:56.990 --> 08:59.378
All in favor
of Shane's plan?

09:01.147 --> 09:02.841
I've been blackmailed
by Shane before.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.062
It works.

09:04.064 --> 09:07.955
And all in favor of Liam's
awesome, much better plan?

09:10.094 --> 09:13.308
Et tu, Brenda?

09:13.310 --> 09:15.421
- Well.
- Great.

09:15.423 --> 09:17.159
Now that's settled, what kind
of protest should we do?

09:17.161 --> 09:18.315
Drama club could create
an immersive,

09:18.317 --> 09:19.484
avant-garde experience.

09:19.486 --> 09:21.412
Yarn bombing, hello?

09:21.414 --> 09:23.758
Everyone will have a chance
to make their voices heard.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.457
Lauren, we can't wait for you

09:25.459 --> 09:26.504
to get back to Dallas.

09:26.506 --> 09:28.357
We've missed you
so, so much.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.348
Thanks, Lana and Leslie.
Oh, I've missed you too.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.338
Austin has been a nightmare
I can't wait to wake up from.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.244
Uh-huh, we need to catch
you up on all the goss.

09:37.246 --> 09:38.479
- Misty S.?
- Mm-hmm?

09:38.481 --> 09:39.485
Totally pregnant.

09:39.487 --> 09:41.296
Oh, and ew,
remember Mr. Flint?

09:41.298 --> 09:43.873
He's now, wait for it,
Mrs. Flint.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.199
He's a transistor?

09:46.201 --> 09:48.004
I think it's transformer?

09:48.006 --> 09:49.320
Transgender?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.712
Well, whatever it is,
it's gross.

09:50.714 --> 09:52.924
We're all trying to
get him/her fired.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.363
I don't really think
it's gro...

09:54.365 --> 09:58.007
OMG, Lauren.
Misty S. was dance captain.

09:58.009 --> 09:59.483
Her spot is open now.

09:59.485 --> 10:00.947
You're a lock for it.

10:00.949 --> 10:02.490
In all my years
as an educator,

10:02.492 --> 10:05.425
I have never come across
a school quite like Hester,

10:05.427 --> 10:07.354
- and I mean that in a bad way.
- Hey. It's not too late for my plan.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.745
No need for blackmail.

10:08.747 --> 10:09.987
This protest will work.

10:09.989 --> 10:12.183
There's no way
they're gonna shut us down.

10:12.185 --> 10:13.678
Too late to get my name
on the list?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.524
Karma?
You want to protest?

10:15.526 --> 10:18.507
Can you imagine if they sent
us all to different schools?

10:18.509 --> 10:21.809
Saving Hester is bigger than
anything going on between us.

10:21.811 --> 10:22.684
Right on.

10:22.686 --> 10:25.376
You can go before Penelope does,

10:25.378 --> 10:27.081
whatever it is she's planning.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.859
It'll make perfect sense,
trust me.

10:28.861 --> 10:32.526
If I can't save it,
no one can.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.274
Thank you,
Principal Turner.

10:36.276 --> 10:38.576
We will now hear
from the students.

10:45.569 --> 10:47.726
Members of the school board,

10:47.728 --> 10:49.195
Hester's motto is,

10:49.197 --> 10:51.551
"Together, we stand apart."

10:51.553 --> 10:52.958
And in that spirit,

10:52.960 --> 10:56.199
our student body's shown up
to protest this injustice.

10:56.201 --> 10:58.151
First up, the madrigal choir.

10:58.153 --> 11:00.765
Young man,
we don't have all day.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.251
You have five minutes.

11:02.253 --> 11:03.252
- What?
- You can't do that.

11:03.254 --> 11:04.923
We can't do anything
in five minutes.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.539
We can do that.
We are doing that.

11:11.684 --> 11:14.691
_

11:26.774 --> 11:28.898
Amy.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.015
It's been a while.

11:30.017 --> 11:32.027
I've missed you a lot,

11:32.029 --> 11:34.125
and if I could just
come in for a second...

11:34.127 --> 11:36.811
Who is it?

11:36.813 --> 11:40.717
Um, Amy, this is Heather.
My girlfriend.

11:40.719 --> 11:42.374
Hi.

11:42.376 --> 11:43.909
Oh.
Hi.

11:49.552 --> 11:51.498
I moved in two weeks ago.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.174
It's soon, but when you share

11:53.176 --> 11:55.611
a connection like ours,
why wait?

11:55.613 --> 11:57.088
Wow.

11:57.090 --> 11:59.932
That's just so inspiring.

11:59.934 --> 12:02.181
Heather, honey, uh...

12:02.183 --> 12:03.227
I think we're running
low on tea.

12:03.229 --> 12:04.430
Will you brew some more?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.124
Oh, yeah.

12:08.582 --> 12:12.339
Okay, spill.
What's going on?

12:12.341 --> 12:13.011
Oh.

12:15.244 --> 12:17.648
I know it seems like
I came back here

12:17.650 --> 12:20.880
to get back together.

12:20.882 --> 12:23.601
But in fact,
I wanted to...

12:23.603 --> 12:25.785
give you back
this hair band.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.530
I know how much you hate
your hair in your face.

12:28.532 --> 12:30.593
It's Karma, isn't it?

12:30.595 --> 12:31.859
It's okay.

12:31.861 --> 12:33.613
You can talk to me about it.

12:33.615 --> 12:35.812
That's the perk of having
an ex-girlfriend, right?

12:35.814 --> 12:37.008
It is?

12:37.010 --> 12:42.212
Okay, then...
well, here it goes.

12:42.214 --> 12:44.090
I'm starting to have
feelings for her again.

12:45.740 --> 12:49.150
- And she's still...
- Yup.

12:49.152 --> 12:51.074
Still straight.

12:51.076 --> 12:53.074
And I'm miserable.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.843
Again.

12:54.845 --> 12:57.596
And when I was with you,
I was actually happy.

12:59.228 --> 13:00.798
But you've moved on,

13:00.800 --> 13:03.879
and I'm stuck
going backwards.

13:03.881 --> 13:05.738
Amy, if you don't want
to move backwards,

13:05.740 --> 13:07.967
then you need to push
yourself forward.

13:07.969 --> 13:09.684
Okay, you can't keep relying
on other people

13:09.686 --> 13:11.235
to get over Karma.

13:11.237 --> 13:12.304
You need to do it
on your own.

13:12.306 --> 13:14.288
- I've tried.
- Have you?

13:14.290 --> 13:16.086
Because the only way
I know to get over someone

13:16.088 --> 13:17.222
is time and space,

13:17.224 --> 13:19.391
and you've never done
either of those.

13:19.393 --> 13:21.601
Why don't you just

13:21.603 --> 13:24.256
get out of town for a while
or something?

13:29.594 --> 13:31.573
Do you still need someone
to film that tour?

13:34.388 --> 13:35.949
Vashti Nadira reporting live

13:35.951 --> 13:38.176
as Hester's future
hangs in the balance.

13:38.178 --> 13:40.085
And this balloon
represents censorship.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.751
And this balloon
represents tyranny.

13:41.753 --> 13:43.692
Order! I will have order!

13:43.694 --> 13:45.609
I told you this place
couldn't be saved.

13:45.611 --> 13:46.681
We should have gone
with my plan.

13:46.683 --> 13:47.952
Oh, I'm sorry
that I didn't want to

13:47.954 --> 13:49.456
cheat and lie my way
to victory.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.391
What's that, Liam?
You don't like lying?

13:51.393 --> 13:52.869
That's funny,
you never mention it!

13:52.871 --> 13:54.106
Guys, stop fighting.

13:54.108 --> 13:55.819
If we lose Hester,
we could be

13:55.821 --> 13:59.693
split up from our
various best friends.

13:59.695 --> 14:01.219
I should have known
it was all about Amy.

14:01.221 --> 14:02.639
- It's not all about Amy.
- Thank you for enlightening me.

14:02.641 --> 14:03.876
It's all about her!

14:05.834 --> 14:09.161
I've got something to say.

14:11.365 --> 14:13.046
Okay.

14:13.048 --> 14:14.383
When I first came to Hester,

14:14.385 --> 14:17.544
I thought, "What the [bleep]
is wrong with this place?"

14:17.546 --> 14:19.965
Drama club
is cooler than football?

14:19.967 --> 14:22.663
The most popular kid in school
is an obnoxious gay guy,

14:22.665 --> 14:24.646
and his best friend
is a straight manwhore,

14:24.648 --> 14:26.211
and it's not even
a little weird.

14:26.213 --> 14:29.176
Two girls pretended
to be lesbians.

14:29.178 --> 14:30.751
Why?

14:30.753 --> 14:32.896
Because at Hester,

14:32.898 --> 14:35.539
being different makes you cool.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.810
I had a hard time with that.

14:37.812 --> 14:39.881
The one thing that makes
me different is the one thing

14:39.883 --> 14:43.572
I've always tried to hide.

14:43.574 --> 14:47.213
I'm intersex.

14:47.215 --> 14:50.787
I never said that out loud
before I came here.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.781
Turner wants Hester to be
more like other schools,

14:52.783 --> 14:57.136
and I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

14:57.138 --> 14:59.420
I think other schools
should be more like Hester.

15:00.068 --> 15:03.097
Because...

15:03.099 --> 15:05.417
this is a school
that accepts you,

15:05.419 --> 15:08.670
even if you don't
accept yourself.

15:08.672 --> 15:11.890
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

15:22.936 --> 15:27.356
Put me down right now.

15:27.358 --> 15:28.990
You want to
come celebrate?

15:28.992 --> 15:32.110
I have to go home
and unpack.

15:32.112 --> 15:34.322
Leila! Lisbeth!

15:34.324 --> 15:36.514
Well, I guess neither of us
was meant to save Hester.

15:36.516 --> 15:38.141
As much as it
pains me to say,

15:38.143 --> 15:39.618
Lauren was.

15:39.620 --> 15:40.952
Yeah.

15:40.954 --> 15:42.396
Shane, you're not
a bad person.

15:42.398 --> 15:44.045
I'm sorry for saying
that you are.

15:44.047 --> 15:45.957
And I'm sorry
I called you a Booker.

15:45.959 --> 15:47.567
And that was a low blow.

15:47.569 --> 15:52.425
Celebratory drum circle
in the quad.

15:52.427 --> 15:54.170
- I'm game if you are.
- Sure.

15:54.172 --> 15:57.013
Let's go beat one out.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.048
Amy?

15:58.050 --> 15:58.854
Karma?

16:00.362 --> 16:01.717
Do you know where Amy is?

16:01.719 --> 16:03.750
Oh, honey.
Didn't she tell you?

16:03.752 --> 16:05.366
Tell me what?

16:05.368 --> 16:07.393
Here we go, girls.
Tour starts now.

16:07.395 --> 16:09.281
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

16:13.821 --> 16:16.538
I think you forgot something.

16:19.090 --> 16:20.757
Hey.

16:23.807 --> 16:26.238
You were gonna take off
for the entire summer

16:26.240 --> 16:27.884
and not say goodbye?

16:27.886 --> 16:29.710
I was gonna call
from the road.

16:29.712 --> 16:31.738
Okay, I know
what's going on.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.597
You didn't want
to tell me

16:32.599 --> 16:34.179
that you're getting
back together with Reagan

16:34.181 --> 16:36.127
because you know deep
down, it's a bad idea.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.386
I'm not back together
with Reagan.

16:37.388 --> 16:40.298
She's staying here this summer
with her new girlfriend.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.208
It... it's your mom,
isn't it?

16:42.210 --> 16:43.460
I mean,
Bruce is moving out,

16:43.462 --> 16:46.901
and... and you don't want
to deal with the drama.

16:46.903 --> 16:51.178
Do you really have no idea
what this is about?

16:51.180 --> 16:54.149
You kissed me.

16:54.151 --> 16:57.146
I know.
I messed up.

16:57.148 --> 16:58.972
But we can't let
that kiss ruin everything.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.393
I mean, this is our chance
to get back on track.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.083
I don't want
to get back on track.

17:03.085 --> 17:04.589
I can't keep
getting back on track.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.220
The track is just a loop
that runs straight

17:07.222 --> 17:10.284
through my heart over
and over and over again.

17:10.286 --> 17:11.933
I'm sorry.

17:11.935 --> 17:14.742
I'm sorry that this year
has been so hard,

17:14.744 --> 17:16.598
but, I-I mean,
you didn't show up

17:16.599 --> 17:18.307
to save Hester,
and now you're taking off

17:18.309 --> 17:19.145
for the whole summer.

17:19.146 --> 17:21.057
Why am I the only person
fighting for us?

17:21.059 --> 17:22.440
This is fighting for us.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.281
No, this is running away.

17:25.284 --> 17:28.204
We've never spent
this much time apart.

17:28.205 --> 17:32.435
I mean, what... what if we
can't come back from this?

17:32.437 --> 17:37.711
I mean, what if this is
the beginning of the end?

17:37.713 --> 17:41.372
We promised each other...
roommates in college

17:41.374 --> 17:45.349
and... and houses next door
to each other.

17:45.351 --> 17:47.057
Best friends forever.

17:49.311 --> 17:51.432
Don't you want that anymore?

17:51.434 --> 17:54.728
Yeah, I do.

17:54.730 --> 17:56.282
Of course I do.

17:58.975 --> 18:02.230
But if I don't go, we'll never
be able to have that.

18:02.232 --> 18:04.302
Yes... yes, we will.

18:04.304 --> 18:09.462
We will.
This is us.

18:09.464 --> 18:13.633
We can make it
through anything.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.463
Then we can get through
a summer apart.

18:16.465 --> 18:21.998
Hey, camera girl?
We got to go.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.845
Amy.
Please.

18:25.847 --> 18:29.232
What do I have to do
to get you to stay?

18:33.802 --> 18:37.490
You can tell me that
that kiss meant something.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.364
I can't.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.173
Have a good summer, Karma.
