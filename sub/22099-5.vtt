GAETA: Previously
on Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.026
You're gonna hold me
in your arms,

00:27.111 --> 00:28.861
you're gonna tell me
that you love me.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.446
You're insane.

00:33.075 --> 00:37.453
You kill me, I download.
I come back, we start over.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.289
I don't belong here!
Let me out!

00:40.958 --> 00:43.543
Some of those guys who joined
up with the Cylon police,

00:43.627 --> 00:45.044
I bet they're in over
their heads, you know?

00:45.129 --> 00:47.046
One day,
when this is all over,

00:47.131 --> 00:49.382
guys like that
are gonna get strung up.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.717
Guys like you and me,

00:50.801 --> 00:55.388
we're gonna be there, tying
the knots, making them tight.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.015
Where are you getting this
stuff? Who's your source?

00:58.100 --> 01:01.269
I have no idea. The source
won't tell me what their name is.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.937
It's probably safer
for all of us.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.063
Mr. President?

01:04.148 --> 01:05.148
Good morning, Gaeta.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.776
This is a death warrant. Have
you seen the names on this list?

01:08.861 --> 01:10.445
Do you have any idea what
they're about to do out there?

01:10.529 --> 01:13.406
I got this from the dead drop, from
the source in the administration.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.949
It's a death list
and Cally's name is on it.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.659
(SCREAMING)

01:17.828 --> 01:20.329
Run, don't look back. Go!

01:21.498 --> 01:22.498
Take cover!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.083
SAM: We were ambushed
at the rendezvous.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.169
The Cylons knew exactly
where we were gonna be.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.628
That doesn't mean Ellen...
I didn't do anything!

01:27.713 --> 01:29.297
This is the map
that I drew for you.

01:29.381 --> 01:33.092
You were gonna burn it, but then
your wife offered to do it for you.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.428
You know what has
to be done here.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.680
Now, it would be better
for her sake if it was you.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.686
Come on! Move! Move, move!

01:45.522 --> 01:47.023
Evacuate the entire facility.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.859
You should go as well, Gaius.
There's a place for you, too.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.201
CONNOR: Walk.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.967
(COUGHING)

02:26.271 --> 02:30.525
Evidence for the following charges
have been presented to the Circle,

02:30.943 --> 02:33.486
that you carried arms
for the enemy,

02:34.029 --> 02:37.156
that you carried out multiple
raids against the human population,

02:37.241 --> 02:41.452
and that during one raid, 23 people
were killed by you and your men

02:41.537 --> 02:43.454
during the assault
on the Temple of Artemis.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.956
It's not true!

02:47.584 --> 02:50.461
These are the names of the people killed
by you and those under your command.

02:50.546 --> 02:51.921
You look at those names!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.256
SEELIX: Connor.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.555
The Circle has examined the evidence
and found you guilty of treason

03:00.639 --> 03:03.099
and crimes against humanity.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.602
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is passed?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.396
I was trying
to help people.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.648
You didn't do a very good job
then, did you?

03:10.732 --> 03:13.317
All right, let's just get this
over with.

03:13.402 --> 03:16.445
I helped people.
I helped lots of people!

03:17.155 --> 03:21.909
Chief? Chief? Chief, I
helped Cally. I saved Cally.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.912
I saved Cally!

03:24.997 --> 03:26.205
What do you mean,
you helped Cally?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.290
I'm the one.
I'm the one who did...

03:27.374 --> 03:29.000
I'm the one who let her go
when they were gonna shoot her.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.544
I took her out of line. I said, "Go,
run right now, get out of here. "

03:31.628 --> 03:33.379
And she did.
She ran and she got away.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.757
Because of me, Chief.
I helped Cally. I saved Cally.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.928
Cally did get away somehow.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.932
Well, they killed 23 people
during the Temple raids,

03:45.017 --> 03:48.311
12 men, eight women
and three children.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.937
Children!

03:50.022 --> 03:51.981
My son is on this list!

03:52.900 --> 03:54.525
His name is right there,

03:54.610 --> 03:57.153
and that frakking
son of a bitch put him there.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.281
So, saving Cally,
if that happened,

04:01.992 --> 04:04.619
does that make up
for killing my son?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.832
Answer the question, Chief.

04:10.167 --> 04:15.504
Does saving Cally let him off
the hook for killing 23 others?

04:31.855 --> 04:35.733
Did you do this, Jammer?
Did you kill these people?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.029
Answer me.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.158
It was crazy
down there, Chief.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.036
You know that.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.832
You make these decisions
so fast.

04:52.376 --> 04:55.628
You're making an arrest, and
people come out with their hands up.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.129
But sometimes
that's just a trick.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.422
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:58.507 --> 05:00.299
They tell you they're surrendering,
and then they open fire.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.802
We thought
they were insurgents.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.972
It wasn't until after,
when we saw the bodies...

05:09.017 --> 05:11.060
What was I supposed to do?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.736
No, it doesn't.

05:25.993 --> 05:30.913
Under the Articles, the
punishment for treason is death.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.333
Sentence confirmed

05:34.418 --> 05:38.587
and carried out on this, the
third day of the Second Exodus.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.092
Chief...

05:48.140 --> 05:49.181
I'm sorry!

05:49.266 --> 05:51.559
There's too much
frakking talk.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.774
Wait.

Hey, buddy, there you go.

comfortable than me, huh?

Cally?
Mmm-hmm?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.705
When you were down
on the planet,

08:17.789 --> 08:20.124
you ran away from the trucks,

08:23.670 --> 08:25.462
did anybody help you?

08:26.131 --> 08:28.883
One of the NCP goons
or anybody?

08:28.967 --> 08:31.802
What? No.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.725
Wait. Yeah.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.769
Somebody told me to run.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.440
It probably was one
of those goons.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.278
But I haven't thought
about it since.

about that?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.813
In my opinion,
it wasn't his fault.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.607
I hate to admit it,
but the Admiral's right.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.943
He was in an
impossible situation.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.113
I'd have probably done
the same in his position.

10:14.698 --> 10:19.702
Well, if that's the way it has to
be, then that's the way it has to be.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.497
No hard feelings?

10:24.582 --> 10:25.749
None.

that we'd like to move on.

You fools.
You're being too lenient.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.653

actively sought your deaths.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.721
how long before the new Quorum
of Twelve can be sworn in?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.181

14:09.557 --> 14:13.435
I will personally place your name
in nomination as my vice president.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.564
Once they confirm you, I submit my
resignation and you get sworn in.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.484
I think it should take
less than an hour.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.404
You're stepping down without a fight.
It means Tom Zarek wants something.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.698
So why don't you put
your cards on the table,

14:26.783 --> 14:30.244
and let's see if it's a price
that I'm willing to pay?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.163
Well, I'm a realist.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.627
I never had any illusions about
remaining in office for very long.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.463
And the Admiral's
made it quite clear

14:41.548 --> 14:46.134
that he'd like nothing better than to put
me in a cell if I try to hang onto power.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.220
He's trying to do you a favor.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.598
You and I both know how impossible
it would be to govern this fleet

14:51.683 --> 14:53.600

of the military.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.103

14:58.690 --> 15:02.943
Even so, I want to be
included in the new government.

that kind of courage.

I stood beside Gaeta in the CIC for
almost four years. He was like family.

But the fact remains he was the
Chief of Staff to Gaius Baltar,

20:03.786 --> 20:05.287
and that alone
is enough to convict him.

was on the death list.

to remember where I was?

did weigh in your favor.

my job, to help from the inside.

pay the price for what they did,

the Resistance and she died for it.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.681
And I liked her a lot more
than I like Gaeta.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.602
Look, Sam,

32:19.438 --> 32:21.606
I'm in a different place now.

32:23.358 --> 32:29.530
I don't know how else
to explain it to you,

32:30.365 --> 32:31.449
but I got out of that cell,

32:31.533 --> 32:35.703
and it's like someone painted
the world in different colors.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.416
And I look at you,

32:44.713 --> 32:48.257
and I want to tear your eyes
out just for looking at me.

32:50.093 --> 32:53.596
I just want to hurt someone
and it might as well be you.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.229
So you should probably go
before that happens.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.152
Baltar signed death warrants,
organized murder squads.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.571
He collaborated with
the enemy from day one.

33:10.656 --> 33:11.906
Baltar, not Gaeta.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.991
It's the same
gods-damned thing!

33:14.076 --> 33:15.493
SEELIX: He's right.

33:15.577 --> 33:18.454
A lot of people died
because of them, Chief.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.674
Fine. Guilty.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.767
Remember this?

33:40.686 --> 33:42.770
I don't want this anymore.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.241
Sam.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.421
Turn around. On your
knees. On your knees!

35:01.016 --> 35:02.391
Felix Gaeta,

35:04.895 --> 35:08.397
you've been tried and found
guilty of crimes against humanity

35:08.482 --> 35:09.940
by a circle of your peers

35:10.025 --> 35:13.194
as duly authorized by the
President of the Colonies.

35:25.332 --> 35:29.502
If you have any words to offer in
your own defense, now is the time.

35:33.215 --> 35:36.717
Come on, Felix, talk.
We'll listen.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.719
Yeah, that's right.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.014
We'll listen to you tell us
how hiding behind Baltar's skirt

35:42.098 --> 35:44.517
was actually your way
of helping the insurgency.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.143
Say something.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.356
What's the point?

35:51.691 --> 35:53.901
I already tried to explain it.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.822
I'm not gonna beg.

35:57.906 --> 36:01.242
Too bad you didn't grow
that spine four months ago.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.051
Beg.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.765
Beg.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.309
Beg!
TIGH: Thrace...

36:27.394 --> 36:29.436
No. Beg.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.357
Come on, Felix, tell them
how you were actually working

36:33.441 --> 36:35.609
for the Resistance
the entire time!

36:35.694 --> 36:37.027
Come on!

36:37.112 --> 36:40.114
Tell them all about the important
information that you were giving up.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.867
Tell them about all the messages,
and the dog bowl and everything else.

36:42.951 --> 36:43.993
Just tell me.
What?

36:44.077 --> 36:46.370
What did she say?
What did she just say?

36:46.454 --> 36:47.454
Back up!

36:47.539 --> 36:49.456
What did she just say?
What did you say to her?

36:49.541 --> 36:52.167
Tell me, what did you
say to her?

36:53.336 --> 36:55.337
It was a yellow dog bowl.

36:55.422 --> 36:59.758
It was a signal. It meant there
was a message in the garbage dump.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.012
Turn it over, it was a signal.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.097
It meant there was a message
at the garbage dump.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.807
Oh, that was you.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.561
Oh, my God...

37:11.605 --> 37:13.564
What are you doing?
Chief...

37:15.650 --> 37:19.320
There was a yellow dog bowl.
I used it.

37:22.115 --> 37:25.034
But I never knew
who the source was, Colonel.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.662
There's no other way
he could have known.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.749
He's the only other one
that would know about it.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.834
He's the reason
we know about the death lists,

37:33.919 --> 37:36.503
he's the reason I saved Cally,
he's the reason we're on this ship.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.673
He's the one who gave us
the inside information.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.720
There's our source, Colonel.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.893
I did what I could.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.692
I don't know what else
I could've done.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.387
What the hell is this?

38:26.888 --> 38:28.806
It's all perfectly legal.

38:28.890 --> 38:32.101
You'll find a signed executive order
on file authorizing a secret jury

38:32.185 --> 38:35.813
of six men and women to try,
sentence and execute people guilty

38:35.897 --> 38:39.692
of extraordinary crimes while collaborating
with the enemy at a time of war.

38:39.776 --> 38:42.695
There's also a death warrant with
my signature for every conviction.

38:42.779 --> 38:46.907
Your presidency is a farce.
It stops right now.

38:46.992 --> 38:50.869
If they're guilty, they'll be
tried by a jury of their peers.

38:50.954 --> 38:54.790
They have a jury,
but they don't get lawyers.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.167
They don't get to showboat
for weeks and months on end.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.586
They don't get to blame
the system.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.507
And they don't get lasting fame
as martyrs or innocent people

39:03.591 --> 39:06.343
just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

39:06.428 --> 39:09.096
They just disappear, now,

39:09.180 --> 39:11.515
in the gray twilight between
the long night of the occupation

39:11.599 --> 39:13.517
and the dawn of a new era.

39:13.601 --> 39:17.646
You come into office clean,
without their blood on your hands.

39:17.731 --> 39:20.524
Well, thank you,
that's very poetic.

39:20.608 --> 39:23.861
However, you have a problem,
Mr. President.

39:23.945 --> 39:29.408
Everyone, by law, is entitled to a
trial with representation. Everyone.

39:29.492 --> 39:34.038
It is not an option to be
discarded at the President's whim.

39:34.122 --> 39:37.958
You think by making the trials
public that you'll find justice?

39:38.043 --> 39:39.293
Yes, I do.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.004
Come on, Laura.
You're not that naive.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.841
Let me tell you what's going to
happen if these cases go to trial.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.678
It'll consume this fleet
for months, maybe years.

39:49.763 --> 39:53.432
People will be lining up to
testify against their neighbors.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.975
It'll be a circus.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.226
An entertainment for the mob

39:56.311 --> 39:59.938
and you'll be signing death
warrants almost every day.

40:00.023 --> 40:03.567
Is that how you want to spend
your next term, Laura,

40:03.651 --> 40:05.360
as executioner-in-chief?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.956
PRIEST:... with every fiber
of my being.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.793
"... with every fiber
of my being. "

40:21.836 --> 40:23.378
Congratulations,
Madam President.

40:23.463 --> 40:24.797
Thank you.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.260
Thank you all
for once again entrusting me

40:30.345 --> 40:32.930
with this high office
of civil service.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.724
Today is a new beginning
for all of us.

40:36.601 --> 40:40.145
We share a unique destiny,

40:40.230 --> 40:44.441
but our future is ours to shape
and our past cannot be forgotten.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.945
A new day requires
new thinking.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.449
And while I had intended
on using this occasion

40:52.534 --> 40:56.870
as an opportunity to announce the
formation of a special prosecutor's office

40:56.955 --> 41:01.125
charged with investigating acts
of collaboration with the enemy,

41:01.209 --> 41:06.380
I have decided instead that a
different gesture is called for on this,

41:06.464 --> 41:10.717
the first day of my next term
as your president.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.679
We all feel
the need for justice,

41:13.763 --> 41:17.141
and we all feel
the need for vengeance,

41:17.225 --> 41:20.978
and telling the difference between
the two can be difficult at times.

41:21.062 --> 41:25.440
We are all victims of the Cylons
and none of us can be impartial.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.651
I certainly can't.

41:27.735 --> 41:32.156
So today, I am forming a commission
on truth and reconciliation,

41:32.240 --> 41:36.410
to hear our stories and
record them for posterity.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.454
There will be no prosecutions.

41:41.833 --> 41:46.920
I am issuing a general pardon for
every human being in this fleet.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.799
This will not be
a popular move today.

41:51.176 --> 41:56.013
But I truly believe that this is the only
way for us to move forward in strength

41:56.097 --> 41:59.641
in a spirit of healing
and reconciliation.

42:00.685 --> 42:06.857
I thank you for your
continued patience and courage.

42:08.318 --> 42:09.651
Good day.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.459
Thank you.
