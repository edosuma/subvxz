I'm here, I'm alive.

No, absolutely not.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.039
I still live with my mother.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.541

is to face it head-on.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.894
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

07:57.894 --> 08:00.063
I think so.
You're saying

08:00.063 --> 08:01.272
I should suck it up
and come to the party?

08:01.272 --> 08:02.774
- Ex...
- Absolutely what she's saying...

08:02.774 --> 08:05.110
- This is what I'm saying.
- You got it.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.236
- Exactly.
- You got it, you got it. Yeah.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.404
- Yeah, very good.
- Great.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.407
Hey, how you doing?
Welcome back.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.450
You can pop over there.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.786
Make eye contact.
Use your kind eyes.

08:14.786 --> 08:15.954
You want to attract, not repel.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.205
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.082
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hi.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.792
- Good.
- You can, uh... go over there,

08:20.792 --> 08:22.502
- I guess, if you want. Yeah.
- That's a bit better.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.963
- Hi. Welcome back.
Good to see you.
- Oh, there we go.

08:24.963 --> 08:25.922
That was way better.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.186
James.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.688
(grunts)

08:41.688 --> 08:43.148
- My jacket. Get off.
- Oh...

08:43.148 --> 08:45.442
Sorry.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.652
Just didn't-didn't
want you to go.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.155
You didn't answer a call
or a text in, like, six months.

08:50.155 --> 08:54.492
I... I couldn't.
You were off the wagon, James.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.161
It would have been really bad
for both of us, you know.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.829
Self-preservation.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.081
I have to put
my own oxygen mask on first.

09:00.081 --> 09:04.294
Yeah, I know that,
but... it sucked.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.589
Yeah, for me, too.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.008
I get it. I'm a rules guy,
all that stuff,

09:10.008 --> 09:13.303
but it's been awful.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.015
And, you know... lonely.

09:18.183 --> 09:21.394
Yeah. Come inside.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.937
I still hoard the good cookies

09:22.937 --> 09:25.231
and let the dirtbags
eat the lemon ones.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.276
- All right.
- Okay.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.779
Oh, my... Okay, go. Go, go, go.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.162
Okay. I'll see you there?

09:39.162 --> 09:40.914
- JAMES: Yeah.
- Okay.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.502
Well, I did not think
that was going to go that way.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.421
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.298
Also, I invited him
to my birthday party.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.717
Sam, it's his first day back.
You're clearly triggering him.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.345
He-He's not ready
to go to a party.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.180
Should I tell him not to come?

09:57.180 --> 09:59.432
- Sam.
- Right.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.815
BOB:
Ah, there she is.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.608
Looking like a snack...
(chuckles)

10:08.608 --> 10:10.568
...as the kids say.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.862
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Thank you.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.406
- What are you doing?
- Hiding the meds.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.117
There will be addicts here.
It's for their own sake.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.828
You can't overdose
on antidepressants, Mom.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.288
No, but you can get
brain damage.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.832
I read this article
in <i>Parade</i> magazine.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.542
Oh, that poor woman.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.462
It's going to be a beautiful,
wonderful evening, I promise.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.005
That's right,

10:31.005 --> 10:32.799
'cause I trimmed
all the rose bushes

10:32.799 --> 10:34.634
and filled the gopher holes.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.970
- We are party ready.
- SAMANTHA: Yeah, we sure are.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.597
I got every single kind
of cheese a person could get,

10:39.597 --> 10:42.433
and I think it looks...
looks really beautiful.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.561
You guys just need
to stay in here, that's all.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.688
You just can't...

10:46.688 --> 10:48.064
I mean, you can say hi
to a couple of people,

10:48.064 --> 10:49.315
but then mostly
just stay inside. Right?

10:51.067 --> 10:53.736
I better go spray for gnats.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.532
Mom. I'd love to hear
you say you heard me.

10:57.532 --> 11:01.161
Samantha, 29.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.163
I can't believe it.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.249
They say you don't remember
childbirth. This is a lie.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.919
I look at your face, I remember
every second of pushing you out.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.921
I really don't feel
like doing the whole...

11:11.921 --> 11:14.340
22 hours of labor.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.718
The worst pain I've ever felt.
Searing pain.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.137
Like being stabbed
with red hot knives.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.513
I tore like Velcro.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.681
And then at 4:28
on a Wednesday...

11:21.681 --> 11:24.601
And then at 4:28

11:24.601 --> 11:27.645
on a Wednesday morning,
out you popped.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.315
I didn't know
till I saw the photos later,

11:30.315 --> 11:32.567
but, you know,
your baby can be so ugly

11:32.567 --> 11:34.527
and you don't even know it?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.820
And this was me.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.824
- Is this leading to anything?
- Yes.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.828
I took one look at you
and I saw how special you are.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.539
And you are special.
And you are beautiful.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.708
Even without makeup.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.668
I have so much makeup on.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.880

17:14.116 --> 17:15.451
not because
we didn't like each other.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.994
- (sighs)
- I'm not drinking now.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.621
For what, a day?

17:18.621 --> 17:20.081
Okay, well,
how long do I have to be sober

17:20.081 --> 17:21.332
for you to take me back?

17:21.332 --> 17:23.084
No, your sobriety
is not about me. It...

17:23.084 --> 17:25.086
Did you honestly think
that we would just,

17:25.086 --> 17:27.296
like, slip right back into this
without even a conversation?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.382
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- Uh-huh.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.925
- You invited me here.
- I invited you here

17:30.925 --> 17:33.261
because I want
to be friends with you.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.929
We're not friends.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.681
We're just two people
that met at a bar.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.236
CAROL:
I have so much respect
for what you people are doing.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.406
I think, for me,
I would miss the taste.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.283
You know, it would be the...

17:55.283 --> 17:58.452
It would be the-the-the taste
of the prosecco.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.330
The-the-the fizz,
the snap, crackle, pop there.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.999
Do you know--
you don't miss that? No?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.834
(music playing in distance)

18:15.094 --> 18:17.138
Hey, mind if I join you?

18:17.138 --> 18:19.265
Wow, this party
must be really bad.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.517
(chuckles)

18:21.517 --> 18:25.062
It's been a very nice evening.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.441
(sighs)

18:29.984 --> 18:30.901
You okay?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.280
Not really.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.576
I tried really hard, you know?

18:38.576 --> 18:41.579
Just wanted everyone
to have fun, have a great time.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.373
Instead, they're being
super weird and awkward

18:44.373 --> 18:46.125
and not eating the tacos.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.418
Well, thank God you're here
to help with that.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.211
I know.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.047
You can't control
other people's behavior.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.758
I want to so bad.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.594
I really thought
I was helping with James.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.179
Mm.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.014
Bringing him back in
and everything.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.476
Then he tries to smooch me?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.644
I mean, come on.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.020
God, what a dumb birthday.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.483
Look, was the party perfect?
No.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.611
I tripped in a gopher hole
and almost broke my ankle.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.946
But the salami was fantastic.
Baby's going to love it.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.490
(chuckles)

19:17.490 --> 19:19.367
Just 'cause tonight wasn't
exactly as you pictured it

19:19.367 --> 19:22.328
does not mean that you don't
have a life worth celebrating.

19:22.328 --> 19:26.457
Tonight was messy and fun
and very on-brand, frankly.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.084
<i>BOB:
Paging Samantha Fink.</i>

19:28.084 --> 19:30.711
<i>Will Samantha Fink
please come out to the backyard?</i>

19:30.711 --> 19:34.924
<i>To the tent that's the...
the only tent in the backyard.</i>

19:34.924 --> 19:36.884
- (sighs)
- All right. Looks like
they need you out there.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.304
You can't stay in here forever.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.932
Why not? None of the bad stuff's
in here.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.309
Neither's any of the good stuff.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.103
Let's go.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.605
Party's still happening.
(groans)

19:49.605 --> 19:50.564
- Let's go celebrate you.
- Oh, God.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.486
- SAMANTHA: Hi, everybody.
- There she is.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.697
- Ah, here she comes.
- Happy birthday, girl.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.698
BOB:
All right.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.992
Uh, okay. Hi. Um...

20:01.992 --> 20:05.705
We learned this song
in honor of Sam's big day.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.206
- Okay, here we go.
- FELICIA: We're gonna kill it.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.457
We're gonna kill it.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.583
All right.
Hit it, Bob.
