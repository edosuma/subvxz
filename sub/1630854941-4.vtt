WEBVTT

00:54.848 --> 00:55.850
Are you sure?

01:01.439 --> 01:05.110
And there's no way that the bullet
markings could be just a coincidence?

01:06.569 --> 01:08.405
I almost threw the damn thing
in the ocean.

01:10.906 --> 01:13.075
- Just had to open my hands.
- Oh, good Lord.

01:13.994 --> 01:14.995
Have you told Perry?

01:15.452 --> 01:19.498
No, the second he knows, the game
changes for him, changes for everybody.

01:19.999 --> 01:22.419
Hamstrings the case and how he tries it.

01:22.419 --> 01:26.214
But, Clara, if he doesn't know,
he can just keep goin' on like he's...

01:27.756 --> 01:28.882
Like he's been doing.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.635
- How you fellas doing?
- All right.

01:33.388 --> 01:35.431
You think the D.A. has even more?

01:35.931 --> 01:37.017
And if they do?

01:37.017 --> 01:42.230
Well, then they spring it on those boys...
in court, their lawyer having no idea.

01:42.230 --> 01:45.316
So, what's worse?
Knowing your clients pulled the trigger

01:45.316 --> 01:48.736
or not being prepared
when the other side proves it?

02:23.021 --> 02:24.021
Mr. McCutcheon.

02:26.231 --> 02:28.025
It's important, Mr. Finnerty,

02:28.025 --> 02:31.570
that Mason knows the price
for taking up sides against our city.

02:31.947 --> 02:34.907
I've already begun to put
a spotlight on him in my papers

02:34.907 --> 02:37.826
but I also need your radio program.

02:38.828 --> 02:41.498
Light can come
from many different angles.

02:42.082 --> 02:43.124
And when it focuses...

02:43.124 --> 02:48.213
It can shine so bright, it burns whatever
it hits right to the very ground.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.821
I am heading back to the Hall of Records
before they close for the weekend.

03:13.196 --> 03:16.407
It turns out Noreen Lawson
wasn't always Noreen Lawson.

03:16.407 --> 03:17.534
Really?

03:17.534 --> 03:19.911
She was only married two years,
then widowed, poor thing.

03:19.911 --> 03:21.246
Kept her husband's name.

03:21.246 --> 03:23.872
Her maiden name is Taylor.
So, I'm looking for her brother now.

03:24.206 --> 03:27.252
Well, I guess there are a
few V. Taylors in this city.

03:27.252 --> 03:30.046
Forty-seven.
And that's just the downtown area.

03:30.046 --> 03:32.840
Well done.
And you don't need to come back.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.010
I'll lock up.
Go and have a good weekend.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.803
Thank you, Miss Street.

04:53.546 --> 04:54.589
Well, hi, there.

04:55.006 --> 04:57.049
Hey. Thanks for coming.

04:57.592 --> 04:59.678
No, you saved me.
I was just pretending to write.

05:04.099 --> 05:06.017
Hey, what's wrong?

05:07.435 --> 05:09.604
What do you do when it's all too much?

05:12.147 --> 05:14.233
Okay. Okay, come here. Get in.

06:15.169 --> 06:16.963
Welcome to my life raft.

06:18.172 --> 06:19.214
Come on.

06:30.559 --> 06:32.103
Women and children first.

06:37.858 --> 06:38.985
Just a moment.

06:40.653 --> 06:41.863
Sneaky.

06:42.821 --> 06:43.864
That's me.

06:45.075 --> 06:46.576
Okay. In we go.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.709
- Are you kidding?
- Here.

06:57.336 --> 06:59.630
Listen, Faye Gordon
is a set designer friend of mine

06:59.630 --> 07:02.592
and I had her steal most of this
when they wrapped Cuban Love Song.

07:02.592 --> 07:06.845
So, don't turn anything over
because it all says "Property of MGM."

07:08.598 --> 07:10.016
Fake. Fake.

07:10.684 --> 07:11.726
Also fake.

07:17.106 --> 07:18.608
It just keeps going.

07:18.608 --> 07:21.152
You haven't even seen
the good part yet.

07:27.367 --> 07:28.367
Right this way.

07:31.329 --> 07:35.959
This... This is what makes the drive
and all the dust in your face worth it.

07:46.218 --> 07:47.178
Better?

07:49.471 --> 07:53.226
I'm gonna go get a fire going.
Don't go anywhere though, okay?

07:54.019 --> 07:54.978
Anita...

08:02.485 --> 08:03.445
Thank you.

08:05.822 --> 08:07.197
You're welcome.

08:36.393 --> 08:37.854
- We doin' just fine.
- Just fine.

08:37.854 --> 08:40.982
Just fine. I see my pile.
I see your pile.

08:41.732 --> 08:44.693
Two right here, and you know what,
the lovely lady only needs two.

08:44.693 --> 08:46.738
- The dealer take one.
- Thank you, baby.

08:47.488 --> 08:49.616
Oh, Clara. Y'all all right?

08:49.616 --> 08:53.619
Looks like you need to crack the case
of the bad tuna sandwich.

08:53.619 --> 08:55.956
- I been working on it. That was good.
- Hey, Mo!

08:55.956 --> 08:57.623
- No.
- Give it a rest.

08:58.416 --> 09:00.751
Yeah, Mo.
Take it easy.

09:01.126 --> 09:05.340
You know, we got Black Sherlock here
defendin' them stone-cold murderers.

09:05.673 --> 09:07.216
How do you know they're guilty?

09:07.216 --> 09:09.928
You're just a fool with stinky fish hands
from working in a cannery.

09:09.928 --> 09:11.096
Thank you, Pearl.

09:11.096 --> 09:12.806
Look, all I'm sayin'
is everything I'm readin' here,

09:12.806 --> 09:14.390
and I don't know how they didn't do it.

09:14.390 --> 09:17.227
But let's ask Uncle Tom himself.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.940
Ain't gonna be no Uncle Toms
in my house. And he ain't dirty.

09:22.731 --> 09:23.691
Got that?

09:26.194 --> 09:28.697
- I know he ain't dirty.
- Amen, Mo.

09:29.489 --> 09:32.533
But what is dirty is the way I've been
whoopin' your ass all night long!

09:32.533 --> 09:34.661
- That's not a lie. That's not a lie.
- Here we go. Here we go.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.996
Take all five of them.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.780
- No more bets. No more bets, please.
- Yeah.

10:12.156 --> 10:14.658
Friday night
and this is the best we can do?

10:15.784 --> 10:19.580
You'd think with the Luxe still out of
commission, we'd get some spillover.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.375
Fucking fire only scared people away.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.879
I don't know.
Maybe if we got a band.

10:26.629 --> 10:27.589
Right.

10:28.047 --> 10:30.549
You think Guy Lombardo plays for tips?

10:32.260 --> 10:34.763
- Where's my baked potato?
- We're out.

10:35.596 --> 10:39.516
No more free shit ever
since that Jew, Goldstein, got killed.

10:41.561 --> 10:43.979
Brooks couldn't get us a decent ship
from his father's own fleet,

10:43.979 --> 10:47.107
but he a had a line
on free fuckin' cauliflower.

10:53.114 --> 10:55.992
He finally started throwing cash
our way about what?

10:56.575 --> 10:57.953
Five months ago?

10:58.535 --> 10:59.495
Yeah.

11:04.876 --> 11:09.547
Teddy, if these kids at school are saying
things about me and calling me names...

11:09.547 --> 11:12.676
No, Dad, they were just razzing me.
It's no big deal.

11:12.676 --> 11:15.094
Well, that's how it starts.
You can't just tell 'em to f...

11:15.094 --> 11:17.097
Suck eggs. They'll keep at you.

11:20.683 --> 11:22.810
All right, look.
Let's just try this again, all right?

11:23.144 --> 11:24.562
Choke up on your reins. Heels down.

11:24.562 --> 11:26.730
We're gonna give him a big kick
and we're gonna push him on.

11:26.730 --> 11:27.898
Here we go.

11:30.109 --> 11:31.819
Like you mean it this time.

11:31.819 --> 11:34.279
Push him
on. All right. Give him a kick.

11:34.698 --> 11:37.908
- Come on, Teddy. A real kick.
- I am.

11:41.453 --> 11:42.579
Teddy...

11:43.414 --> 11:45.749
if they know you're scared,
they'll do whatever they want.

11:45.749 --> 11:48.920
- I'm not scared!
- So, let him know that.

11:54.091 --> 11:56.969
- Isn't that your teacher, Miss Aimes?
- Where?

11:59.723 --> 12:01.182
Miss Aimes!

12:01.725 --> 12:04.811
- Hello. Good morning, you two.
- Good morning, Miss Aimes.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.022
This is a surprise.
I didn't take you for a rider.

12:07.022 --> 12:10.025
I throw that slightly offensive assumption
right back at you.

12:11.150 --> 12:12.318
I'm-- Yes--

12:12.318 --> 12:14.403
I work here on the weekends
to make a little extra money

12:14.403 --> 12:18.116
and I get to spend time with the horses
which works out nicely for me.

12:20.076 --> 12:22.954
- Are you fellas struggling a bit?
- Just trying to get the hang of it.

12:22.954 --> 12:24.955
Although,
I think the horse is having more fun.

12:25.331 --> 12:26.625
- Dad.
- What?

12:27.876 --> 12:29.543
Mind if I give it whirl?

12:31.713 --> 12:33.632
- How's Zephyr feeling, Teddy?
- Good.

12:34.007 --> 12:35.175
She's the sweetest gal here.

12:35.175 --> 12:38.761
Much better than that stubborn beastie
they had you on before.

12:39.303 --> 12:40.680
Hey, Teddy, keep your heels down.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.223
Let him solve it.
He solves it, it's his.

12:44.851 --> 12:48.396
Apparently, you don't just teach children,
Miss Aimes.

12:49.355 --> 12:50.315
Call me Ginny.

12:51.273 --> 12:53.651
It still feels strange
being called "Miss Aimes."

12:53.985 --> 12:54.943
Why is that?

12:55.278 --> 12:57.989
You know,
I was Mrs. Aimes for so long.

12:59.907 --> 13:01.785
- Your husband...
- Divorced.

13:02.242 --> 13:05.330
So, you just... kept the name,
got rid of the man?

13:05.663 --> 13:07.290
It's much more preferable.

13:07.666 --> 13:10.418
It saved me from going back
to my maiden name...

13:11.085 --> 13:12.379
Szymanski.

13:14.047 --> 13:15.172
Sorry.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.261
- How long you been in LA?
- A year.

13:20.553 --> 13:22.054
I'd always wanted to come.

13:22.596 --> 13:26.142
Read so much about it.
Saw it in the movies and magazines.

13:27.017 --> 13:28.478
And I got myself here.

13:29.396 --> 13:30.813
Yeah, so glad I did.

13:32.315 --> 13:34.066
You really like it that much?

13:35.527 --> 13:38.780
- You don't?
- It doesn't snow. I like that.

13:39.655 --> 13:41.950
French Dip at Cole's ain't bad.

13:43.283 --> 13:46.079
I think we've got ourselves
a new city slogan.

13:47.247 --> 13:49.164
You know what I like most
about this town?

13:50.250 --> 13:52.292
No one tells you what was.

13:53.335 --> 13:54.462
Only what can be.

14:18.403 --> 14:21.613
That's it, Teddy. Look where you're going
and go where you're looking.

14:21.613 --> 14:24.826
- Thanks for the ride, Miss Aimes.
- You're welcome.

14:26.119 --> 14:27.787
- Dad...
- What?

14:30.497 --> 14:32.541
Yes. Thanks.

14:34.418 --> 14:35.544
You're welcome.

14:35.544 --> 14:37.671
Do you wanna give
Zephyr some carrots?

14:37.671 --> 14:40.091
- Yeah.
- Do you remember what to do?

14:40.091 --> 14:43.219
- Hands up.
- Flat hand.

14:43.886 --> 14:45.805
- Flat hands.
- Flat hands.

14:46.681 --> 14:47.931
Good job.

14:48.683 --> 14:51.937
I'm here every Saturday
if you ever want another lesson.

14:53.772 --> 14:54.814
Him or me?

14:55.773 --> 14:56.940
Here, Zephyr.

15:01.612 --> 15:04.865
- Dad, she slobbered on me.
- You know what that means?

15:05.992 --> 15:07.202
She's smitten.

15:07.953 --> 15:09.328
- Stop it.
- Thanks.

15:16.877 --> 15:19.547
Your dad's gonna be so excited
to see you.

15:23.634 --> 15:24.928
Sit with your dad.

15:28.222 --> 15:30.057
You look tired, are you ok?

15:31.935 --> 15:34.187
Mr. Mason got us real mattresses.

15:34.688 --> 15:35.771
Really?

15:36.981 --> 15:40.443
He even gave Rafita those pencils.

15:42.529 --> 15:43.697
We're fine auntie.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.533
Things aren't so bad.

15:47.616 --> 15:48.575
Right, Rafa?

15:49.244 --> 15:50.203
Visitation's over.

16:01.338 --> 16:04.384
It's for Maria.
They tell a nice story, okay?

17:21.002 --> 17:22.045
Goddamn it!

17:25.673 --> 17:26.715
Shit.

17:28.176 --> 17:30.804
- Hi.
- Hello. I was trying to surprise you.

17:31.387 --> 17:33.847
This is surprising. What did you do?

17:34.975 --> 17:36.725
- I burned it.
- On a pan?

17:36.725 --> 17:39.020
No, I was trying
to chop that stupid tomato

17:39.020 --> 17:40.730
and my cigarette fell out of my mouth.

17:41.106 --> 17:42.314
Where's the salt?

17:46.402 --> 17:48.405
- Nice robe.
- Thank you.

17:51.323 --> 17:52.784
Here. Hold that.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.828
Just hold it there.

17:55.954 --> 17:58.748
Now...
what is it you were attempting to make?

18:02.460 --> 18:03.919
Huevos Rancheros?

18:04.962 --> 18:06.881
You know, there's a really
great Mexican joint in town.

18:06.881 --> 18:08.841
- We could just go--
- Step aside.

18:10.552 --> 18:11.677
All right.

18:12.679 --> 18:17.267
Okay... turn on a burner,
put a pan on, low heat.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.353
And try not to drop a cigarette in.

18:23.607 --> 18:26.484
We don't have you listed as clients
and we never have.

18:26.484 --> 18:28.360
Are you new since Goldstein?

18:28.902 --> 18:31.948
Yeah, cause I'm telling you
your dead boss delivered free

18:31.948 --> 18:35.076
to my dead partner twice weekly
for months.

18:35.993 --> 18:37.162
Look. Look.

18:38.955 --> 18:42.626
I'm more interested in any financial
particulars of the arrangement, all right?

18:42.626 --> 18:45.003
What was the play?
Where was the money coming from?

18:45.003 --> 18:46.796
- Who was getting a cut?
- See, I don't know.

18:47.171 --> 18:51.217
Jesus! Come on. Where was
Brooks getting the fuckin' dough?

18:51.718 --> 18:52.676
Never mind.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.141
You fellas drive for this joint?

19:00.268 --> 19:02.478
Any of you deliver to the Morocco?

19:04.814 --> 19:06.982
What about you? Hey!

19:09.945 --> 19:12.572
Let me repeat my question
so you can hear me.

19:13.365 --> 19:15.824
- You ever deliver to the Morocco?
- I don't know anything.

19:15.824 --> 19:17.451
I didn't say there was anything to know.

19:17.451 --> 19:20.622
So, what do you know that your
dumb mouth is trying not to say?

19:20.622 --> 19:23.957
Nothing. I swear.
I got nothing in my head to know.

19:33.592 --> 19:34.551
Look...

19:35.386 --> 19:38.056
- I'm not tryin' to jam up a working man.
- All right.

19:38.056 --> 19:39.975
I just wanna know
if you deliver to the Morocco.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.185
It's not gonna get you in any fix, is it?

19:45.105 --> 19:46.189
Maybe I did...

19:47.482 --> 19:50.526
- A couple of times.
- There you go.

19:51.026 --> 19:53.238
See, it's not that hard, right?

19:56.908 --> 19:58.867
I think my business partner...

19:59.410 --> 20:00.869
was running a game...

20:02.372 --> 20:04.457
making some pretty good coin on it.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.800
You know, I just wanna know what it was.

20:15.594 --> 20:16.552
I figure...

20:18.095 --> 20:20.599
you had to be making something
on the side, right?

20:21.391 --> 20:23.977
So was a lot of these other fellas. But...

20:25.477 --> 20:27.313
today's your lucky day...

20:29.983 --> 20:32.151
'cause I'm not talkin' to them.

20:33.111 --> 20:34.362
I'm talkin' to you.

20:40.868 --> 20:42.537
You help me add it all up...

20:43.747 --> 20:45.915
there might be something in it for you.

20:47.917 --> 20:48.876
So...

20:50.711 --> 20:52.130
Brooks and Goldstein?

20:56.635 --> 20:57.636
Yeah.

20:58.302 --> 21:00.513
They had us runnin' trucks
outside regular business

21:00.513 --> 21:02.431
for five, maybe six months.

21:02.431 --> 21:04.516
What else were you moving for 'em?

21:04.516 --> 21:06.352
You had to be movin'
somethin' other than vegetables

21:06.352 --> 21:07.479
to be makin' all that cash.

21:07.479 --> 21:10.773
There was nothin' else.
We'd pick up the produce from the ships,

21:10.773 --> 21:13.942
middle of the night,
no one around except our trucks.

21:14.401 --> 21:16.404
A private slip up Port Hueneme.

21:16.905 --> 21:19.948
Sometimes I would bring
my load down to the Morocco.

21:19.948 --> 21:22.369
Incoming? It's California.

21:22.369 --> 21:24.119
We're lousy
with fuckin' fruits and vegetables.

21:24.119 --> 21:26.039
Why is a ship comin' in
with stuff we already got?

21:26.039 --> 21:30.251
Beats me. Ask the McCutcheons.
It was their cargo ships.

21:55.026 --> 21:57.736
- Good morning, Miss Street.
- Good morning, Marion.

21:57.736 --> 21:59.990
- Good weekend?
- Yes. Thank you.

22:04.327 --> 22:05.662
Good morning.

22:12.419 --> 22:13.377
So...

22:17.924 --> 22:19.217
You look different.

22:20.342 --> 22:22.345
Got a little sun this weekend.

22:23.512 --> 22:27.058
- You went outside?
- I've been known to, from time to time.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.060
Well, if one of us
is gonna start looking healthy,

22:30.060 --> 22:32.314
it might throw the whole thing off.

22:40.738 --> 22:42.157
Did you have a good weekend?

22:42.616 --> 22:44.074
Yeah,
I took Teddy horseback riding.

22:44.074 --> 22:45.117
- Teddy?
- Yeah.

22:46.119 --> 22:49.371
Yes. He and Linda moved back.
And, yes, I didn't tell you that either.

22:49.371 --> 22:51.833
But that the only other thing, I swear.

22:52.416 --> 22:55.420
So, you've decided
telling me things is okay now?

22:56.045 --> 22:57.255
I'm gonna try.

23:00.467 --> 23:01.550
I found him.

23:01.550 --> 23:03.927
- Found who?
- Noreen's brother. Vincent.

23:03.927 --> 23:06.555
- He's on the city council.
- Councilman? V. Taylor?

23:06.555 --> 23:09.017
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Very.

23:09.350 --> 23:11.518
I cross-referenced his birth certificate

23:11.518 --> 23:13.854
with hospital records
and vehicle registrations.

23:13.854 --> 23:16.274
- But what's his district?
- The seventh.

23:16.274 --> 23:17.609
And he rules it.

23:18.817 --> 23:21.029
McCutcheon Stadium. District Seven.

23:22.112 --> 23:23.281
That's quite a leap.

23:23.281 --> 23:26.033
But definitely worth a conversation
with the councilman.

23:26.033 --> 23:27.868
- Good work.
- Yes. Thank you, Marion.

23:27.868 --> 23:30.037
Hey, Paul.
So, we need to catch you up.

23:30.037 --> 23:32.415
We got a new connection to Brooks,
new line of inquiry

23:32.415 --> 23:33.874
and Street, here, is trying to outlive me

23:33.874 --> 23:37.420
by going outside periodically.
So, district seven...

23:40.298 --> 23:41.591
What the fuck is that?

23:42.800 --> 23:45.512
That's the gun
that killed Brooks McCutcheon.

23:45.886 --> 23:49.056
It's a perfect match for the bullet
that went through his head.

23:49.556 --> 23:51.184
- Okay.
- Where'd you get it?

23:52.101 --> 23:54.436
Ratfuck doing business renting guns

23:55.062 --> 23:57.524
30 yards from where Rafael
and Mateo lived.

23:59.400 --> 24:03.404
- Couldn't it have just been--
- They did it. They're guilty.

24:45.362 --> 24:48.575
This is your last chance.
You now have to tell us the truth.

24:48.575 --> 24:52.661
We are telling the truth.
Every word! We weren't there.

24:52.661 --> 24:54.163
We didn't do it!

24:54.789 --> 24:57.167
You're our lawyer.
You're supposed to believe us.

24:57.167 --> 25:00.587
You know who I do believe?
My investigator, Paul Drake.

25:01.253 --> 25:02.631
Rafael, Mateo.

25:03.131 --> 25:06.259
You rented a Colt 1903,
nickel with a walnut grip

25:06.259 --> 25:09.887
from a piece of shit named Twist,
lives in a shanty just down from yours,

25:10.304 --> 25:13.015
for a dollar, for the day,
with a full magazine.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.393
We now have that gun.

25:16.269 --> 25:19.105
It's in our safe. And I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna give it to Paul,

25:19.105 --> 25:22.107
so he can hand it over to the D.A.
and they can hang you.

25:22.107 --> 25:25.403
Unless one of you wants
to start telling me the fucking truth.

25:25.862 --> 25:28.531
This is the only thing standing
between you and the noose.

25:29.032 --> 25:32.451
- And he's about to walk out that door.
- I'm not about to. Good luck.

25:35.079 --> 25:38.667
- Okay. Okay, okay!
- We had nothing.

25:39.668 --> 25:42.628
No work. You know,
Mateo's kid was going hungry.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.924
No, no, stop. You've got to stop
and get to what you did.

25:48.717 --> 25:50.970
We just wanted a quick score.
Easy money.

25:50.970 --> 25:53.473
We saw that Duesenberg
and figured we hit the jackpot.

25:53.473 --> 25:54.640
Thing's worth as much as a house

25:54.640 --> 25:56.809
so you know the guy's gotta have
a bunch of dough on him.

25:57.226 --> 25:58.310
Who made the shot?

26:00.021 --> 26:02.481
- Who made the shot?
- Me.

26:05.901 --> 26:07.236
I had the gun on him.

26:07.612 --> 26:10.614
Rafael went over to grab the money
and stuff but the guy wouldn't give it.

26:10.614 --> 26:12.658
I mean, we had a gun on him.

26:14.661 --> 26:15.744
Level two.

26:18.122 --> 26:19.957
He should've just done what we said.

26:20.625 --> 26:22.752
But he grabbed Rafa from his seat.

26:23.127 --> 26:25.046
Rafa yelled at me to do something.

26:27.047 --> 26:28.133
So, I shot him.

26:32.428 --> 26:34.389
<i>How did we miss it?
None of this makes sense.</i>

26:34.389 --> 26:36.598
Everything they've said about killing
Brooks doesn't make sense.

26:36.598 --> 26:38.684
- Keep your voice down.
- No. The fuck I will. Fuck those guys.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.061
I know what you're thinking,
and you can't step off this case.

26:41.061 --> 26:43.981
The hell I can't.
I'm not representing two killers.

26:44.608 --> 26:45.774
They're your clients.

26:45.774 --> 26:48.068
And you would need to demonstrate
a compelling reason to step off.

26:48.068 --> 26:49.987
I have one. How 'bout "They did it?"

26:49.987 --> 26:52.239
That breaks privilege
and sends them right to the hangman.

26:52.239 --> 26:55.659
Even asking implies they're guilty
to the public's eye.

26:55.659 --> 26:59.330
- So what? I have to defend them?
- Yes, Perry. We're their best bet.

26:59.330 --> 27:00.707
But the rules have changed.

27:00.707 --> 27:03.627
You can't ask them anything in court
you think they'd be lying about.

27:03.627 --> 27:06.378
Exactly. I can't put 'em on the stand.
I can't humanize them.

27:06.796 --> 27:09.006
You're gonna have an entire jury
looking at two Mexicans,

27:09.006 --> 27:10.299
wondering what it is they're hiding.

27:10.299 --> 27:12.218
And they're right to wonder
'cause they fucking did it.

27:12.218 --> 27:13.344
- Can we move?
- No, we can't.

27:13.344 --> 27:16.097
And what about the gun that killed
Brooks, which is now sitting in our safe?

27:16.097 --> 27:17.765
Us having the gun is a dilemma.

27:17.765 --> 27:20.101
A defendant can't hide evidence
by giving it to their lawyer.

27:20.101 --> 27:22.311
Well, they didn't give it to us.
I found it.

27:23.062 --> 27:24.773
I'll look into it.
There may be a workaround.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.317
I'm sorry, is that an example
of the illusion of justice?

27:27.317 --> 27:30.027
That these guys could get away
with killing, a husband, a father,

27:30.027 --> 27:31.654
just because we found it first?

27:31.654 --> 27:34.990
Look, guilty or not,
everyone deserves a defense.

27:35.324 --> 27:38.870
So, you're just gonna have to step up and
get on with the job of being their lawyer.

27:39.244 --> 27:42.081
- The hell I do.
- Perry. Perry!

27:44.208 --> 27:45.417
Goddamn him!

27:46.920 --> 27:47.963
Let him go.

27:53.550 --> 27:54.802
Mr. Milligan?

27:56.095 --> 27:57.972
Perry Mason is here to see you.

27:59.140 --> 28:02.560
I think there's a way to bring this case
to a sensible conclusion

28:02.560 --> 28:04.436
that would save us all the hassle
of a trial.

28:04.436 --> 28:07.440
- And that is?
- A deal. Brothers plead guilty.

28:07.440 --> 28:10.110
They get life with a chance
of parole in, say, 20 years.

28:10.652 --> 28:13.697
Would you like us to throw in a new car
and a box of chocolates too?

28:13.697 --> 28:15.447
I think it's a fair offer.

28:16.198 --> 28:17.158
No, you don't.

28:17.741 --> 28:18.784
Then tell me what is.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.829
They can slide
the nooses around their own necks

28:20.829 --> 28:23.205
and pull their own trap doors
from under their feet.

28:23.205 --> 28:25.709
Save us the effort of doing it for them.
I think that sounds fair.

28:26.166 --> 28:28.752
Clearly, you and I have
a slight disagreement on what's fair.

28:28.752 --> 28:30.672
Clearly, something's got you spooked.

28:31.006 --> 28:34.508
Life, parole shot in 25.
You do not want this getting ugly, Ham.

28:34.508 --> 28:40.307
Uglier than your clients' brutal murder
of a beloved citizen? Heaven forfend.

28:40.307 --> 28:43.727
You're telling me you have no idea
what the McCutcheon kid was into?

28:43.727 --> 28:46.770
Because, believe me,
it reads like a bad pulp novel.

28:46.770 --> 28:51.234
You got people all over this town dancing
on his grave, and a jury will eat that up.

29:00.118 --> 29:01.911
- He's full of shit.
- Am I, Milligan?

29:01.911 --> 29:03.747
Because I got
a real pretty half-dead girl

29:03.747 --> 29:07.709
in a home with Brooks's name
all over her that says different.

29:11.588 --> 29:12.964
Did you miss that one?

29:14.340 --> 29:15.674
You really had an ace up your sleeve,

29:15.674 --> 29:17.594
you wouldn't be standing here
lookin' for a deal.

29:17.594 --> 29:22.307
Maybe. But you gotta convince 12 jurors.
I need one.

29:22.681 --> 29:25.351
I got all the reasonable doubt
I need for my guys to skate.

29:25.351 --> 29:29.730
Ham, this is your first big case as a
D.A., I don't want it being your last.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.816
Appreciate your heartfelt concern
about my future.

29:33.568 --> 29:37.071
But seeing how we have
the brothers dead to rights and all,

29:37.821 --> 29:40.033
we're gonna have to turn you down.

29:41.700 --> 29:42.953
Your funeral.

29:55.005 --> 29:56.048
Thank you.

30:00.177 --> 30:01.721
I swear to God, it took everything in me

30:01.721 --> 30:06.225
not to smack that cat-ate-the-mouse
grin off Milligan's stupid face.

30:06.225 --> 30:09.771
You really think they were gonna bite
on that stale dog?

30:10.688 --> 30:12.565
Shit, Burger and Milligan,

30:12.565 --> 30:16.902
they've been pushin' us investigators
to thicken the file against your clients.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.779
They ain't stupid, you know?

30:19.571 --> 30:22.700
You looked at these things lately?
The public's eatin' it up.

30:23.493 --> 30:25.744
I know. I'm the main course.

30:25.744 --> 30:28.080
Brought to you by that prick,
Lydell McCutcheon,

30:28.080 --> 30:31.208
and his merry band of muckrakers.
You seen this?

30:32.711 --> 30:34.378
"Mason the Mexi Mouthpiece."

30:34.754 --> 30:37.340
"Maggot Mason,"
courtesy of Frank Finnerty.

30:37.965 --> 30:40.426
And Della's favorite, "Pedro Perry."

30:41.176 --> 30:43.512
You know, you really got
a thing for the browns.

30:43.847 --> 30:47.182
You were crotchin' that Lupe broad
this way and that. Now, these two.

30:47.182 --> 30:50.103
- What is it with you?
- What is it with you?

30:54.107 --> 30:55.609
Look, Strick, what...

30:56.693 --> 30:59.029
What's it gonna take
for Burger to back down off this thing?

30:59.445 --> 31:01.697
Come on, man,
you gotta know something.

31:02.239 --> 31:05.243
I know the guy signs my paychecks,
and feeds my kids.

31:05.744 --> 31:08.663
Strick, we're shooting the shit.
This is off the record.

31:09.330 --> 31:12.500
Off the record, my ass.
Fuck that.

31:13.543 --> 31:15.962
- Y'all finished?
- Thank you.

31:22.551 --> 31:25.721
Look at this. He's got 'em shittin'
all over me on the front pages.

31:25.721 --> 31:31.019
He's got one, two, three articles
about his horse on the sports pages.

31:32.103 --> 31:33.146
Gusher's Rush.

31:34.689 --> 31:38.233
Ran the fastest six furlongs
at Santa Anita.

31:38.652 --> 31:40.319
Greedy fuck doesn't deserve that animal.

31:40.319 --> 31:44.658
Holy shit. I wonder what it's like
to ride on a pile of loot like that.

31:51.288 --> 31:52.539
One way to find out.

32:01.883 --> 32:04.009
We're good. We're good. We're good.

32:04.343 --> 32:05.720
There's no one here.

32:19.900 --> 32:24.113
No, no, no, no. I just want you to see it.
You were curious.

32:24.489 --> 32:28.826
It was a hypothetical. Not something
that's ever really gonna happen.

32:31.538 --> 32:33.581
Look at these beauties, Mason.

32:41.588 --> 32:43.882
Someone forgot to lock the door.

32:48.471 --> 32:51.473
Would you look at this?
Jesus.

32:52.684 --> 32:55.228
Hey!
Come on.

32:55.854 --> 32:59.941
Let's go to Musso, post up at the bar,
see what the cat drags in. Come on.

33:00.483 --> 33:03.444
Hello, Gusher's Rush.

33:09.868 --> 33:12.578
It's pitch black. How are you even
gonna see where you're going?

33:12.578 --> 33:16.416
I don't have to. He can.
He really is a perfect machine.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.501
Last chance to hop on board.

33:19.544 --> 33:22.046
- This is your thing.
- It sure as hell is.

33:22.923 --> 33:25.132
Hold onto this.
I'm gonna hold onto him.

33:25.674 --> 33:28.469
Your daddy's not gonna be happy
about this.

33:35.225 --> 33:37.562
You're one crazy son of a bitch, Mase.

33:39.314 --> 33:40.315
Come on!

33:44.985 --> 33:47.447
Yeah! Go, boy.

33:49.699 --> 33:50.784
Come on, boy.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.413
Strick, you seein' this?

33:56.914 --> 34:01.544
We've got ourselves a race here, folks.
It's Gusher's Rush and Gallant Fox.

34:01.919 --> 34:04.589
Gusher's Rush,
ridden by Perry Mason.

34:04.589 --> 34:08.510
And down the backstretch they come,
Gusher's Rush and Gallant Fox.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.177
Gallant Fox and Gusher's Rush!

34:10.177 --> 34:13.097
And at the wire,
it's Gusher's Rush by a nose!

34:17.852 --> 34:19.229
Oh, good Christ.

34:20.688 --> 34:21.647
Perr!

34:22.523 --> 34:24.608
Perr, Let's go. Hey. Come on.

34:27.862 --> 34:29.864
- Come on. Let's go.
- Shit.

34:32.366 --> 34:33.659
- Come first.
- Do you see 'em?

34:34.159 --> 34:36.121
- Quit laughin'! Quit laughin!
- Shut up!

34:36.454 --> 34:37.497
I told you!

34:40.834 --> 34:43.128
- You clocked? You got 'em?
- Shut up!

34:45.338 --> 34:46.298
I told you!

34:47.340 --> 34:49.258
They're too busy chasin'
that gravy on a hoof.

34:49.258 --> 34:51.885
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it! I told you!

34:52.219 --> 34:55.390
- What? Told me what? Where you goin'?
- Goin' home!

34:56.390 --> 34:59.144
- I gotta be up to work in two hours.
- What? To kiss Burger's ass?

34:59.144 --> 35:01.520
Pete Strickland don't kiss
nobody's ass, Perry.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.064
- Really?
- Yeah. Fuck you.

35:03.064 --> 35:06.025
I'm just tryin'
to keep my fuckin' job, Perry.

35:23.877 --> 35:27.421
- Pleasure to see you again, Miss Street.
- You too. Thank you.

35:27.421 --> 35:28.548
Right this way.

35:31.217 --> 35:32.551
Once more from the top.

35:35.929 --> 35:38.475
Okay, entering the different
articulations, don't anticipate.

35:38.475 --> 35:41.769
Here they come, the back and forth,
staccato, legato.

35:47.024 --> 35:47.983
Good.

35:53.781 --> 35:56.325
They're keys, not dragons, Constance.

35:56.325 --> 35:58.745
You don't have to slay them.
You just have to play them.

35:58.745 --> 36:01.373
Corral those nerves and use the energy.

36:01.705 --> 36:03.500
- Have you eaten?
- No.

36:05.627 --> 36:07.962
Keep playing, dear. I'm listening.

36:17.346 --> 36:19.599
You must try the coarse wheat bread.

36:20.517 --> 36:23.602
I have one of my farms
in the Central Valley

36:23.602 --> 36:28.649
studying how the food we grow and eat
affects our body's biological process.

36:28.649 --> 36:31.235
Phippsy thinks it's a giant waste
of money.

36:31.695 --> 36:34.572
But longevity, that is the key.

36:35.406 --> 36:39.076
- And what have you learned?
- It's all about seeds and grains.

36:39.076 --> 36:41.913
If it gets caught in your teeth,
it's good for you.

36:42.371 --> 36:45.000
Excellent articulation, Constance!

36:49.128 --> 36:50.880
Now, how can I help you, dear?

36:52.465 --> 36:54.926
I just had a few more questions
pertaining to the case.

36:55.718 --> 37:00.014
I was hoping to learn a little more
about how Brooks financed his stadium.

37:00.472 --> 37:02.851
Was there anything physical?

37:02.851 --> 37:06.396
Paperwork he gave to you when he
asked you to invest? A prospectus?

37:06.396 --> 37:08.439
Were there any other investors?

37:08.939 --> 37:10.816
Where's Mr. Mason?

37:12.568 --> 37:15.029
He's... busy elsewhere.

37:17.656 --> 37:19.825
Pursuing another line of inquiry.

37:21.327 --> 37:22.787
Everything all right?

37:24.371 --> 37:25.707
Our clients are fighting for their lives

37:25.707 --> 37:29.793
in a city that barely regards them as
human, so no, not entirely.

37:30.336 --> 37:32.796
I mean, with you and Mr. Mason.

37:36.259 --> 37:37.468
Yes, fine.

37:38.803 --> 37:40.847
He seems a bit... broken.

37:41.805 --> 37:44.976
It can be difficult to be in the trenches
with someone like that.

37:46.645 --> 37:47.687
He's not...

37:49.438 --> 37:52.650
His tactics are different than mine.
He's more...

37:54.318 --> 37:56.362
- Instinctive.
- "Instinctive."

37:57.237 --> 38:01.159
Well, is that a nice way
of saying that he gets to be impulsive

38:01.159 --> 38:04.119
and run roughshod
while you have to stand by and watch?

38:05.872 --> 38:08.583
You're frustrated.
It's okay to say it.

38:10.793 --> 38:14.046
It's a difficult case. There's an enormous
amount of pressure and--

38:14.046 --> 38:16.841
And sometimes,
Mason is a pain in the ass.

38:18.133 --> 38:19.218
No, he's...

38:20.553 --> 38:24.224
- Sometimes he's an ass, yes.
- There you go. See, look at you.

38:25.267 --> 38:28.228
There is power in the truth.
Don't forget that.

38:33.357 --> 38:35.901
He's my best chance at building a firm,

38:36.778 --> 38:38.487
having my name on the door.

38:39.530 --> 38:41.657
If that's what you want,
then you shouldn't waver

38:41.657 --> 38:45.578
'cause we do what we have to
to become who we are, yes?

38:47.747 --> 38:48.914
Yes.

39:12.855 --> 39:15.607
...and the rest is 40 to 50 years later.

39:15.607 --> 39:17.109
- Mr. Mason.
- Have you seen Teddy?

39:18.068 --> 39:20.779
- He's just there.
- Hey, Teddy? Let's go.

39:21.155 --> 39:22.991
- Just a second.
- No, no, no. Now. Let's go now.

39:23.324 --> 39:24.867
- Hold on.
- I said now!

39:26.202 --> 39:28.747
I expect that's how you'd treat your boy.

39:29.538 --> 39:30.581
Excuse me?

39:30.581 --> 39:33.501
You treat those Mexican boys
better than you treat your own son.

39:33.501 --> 39:34.710
Maggot Mason.

39:39.048 --> 39:41.634
Teddy, let's go. Let's go, now. Now.

39:43.636 --> 39:45.220
Go. I'll take him home.

40:14.041 --> 40:16.253
- Come on, baby.
- No, I don't, no, no, no.

40:17.379 --> 40:21.340
We have this place to ourselves
for the first time in a month.

40:21.883 --> 40:24.843
And you gonna sit there
like a cow chewin' cud.

40:27.429 --> 40:31.434
Paul Drake, get up right now
before I stick you with my sewing needle.

40:47.993 --> 40:49.119
Where is it?

40:51.329 --> 40:52.496
Where's what?

40:52.496 --> 40:55.624
The place that your head
is visiting right now?

40:57.877 --> 40:59.546
- The case.
- Yeah.

41:00.838 --> 41:03.216
Baby, those boys confessed to ya.

41:04.801 --> 41:07.846
Mason tried to get a plea deal
but got shot down.

41:08.930 --> 41:09.931
So, what now?

41:12.850 --> 41:13.851
I don't know.

41:15.061 --> 41:17.604
And I don't think Mason know neither.

41:20.190 --> 41:21.359
But I'm still...

41:21.860 --> 41:25.779
I'm still caught on that,
them boys giving theirself up like that.

41:26.156 --> 41:29.116
- Somethin' off?
- No, that's what's off.

41:31.035 --> 41:34.581
Everything perfectly lined up
just like the D.A. had it.

41:36.707 --> 41:38.917
Moving target, one perfect shot.

41:39.252 --> 41:42.963
Boys say there was a struggle,
but ain't no signs of that struggle.

41:44.382 --> 41:45.674
I'm not sure.

41:47.843 --> 41:49.970
Well, Mason hired you as an investigator.

41:49.970 --> 41:52.348
- Yeah.
- So, investigate.

41:56.685 --> 41:57.896
Okay.

41:57.896 --> 42:02.816
Now... we got about 40 minutes
before this place fills back up again

42:02.816 --> 42:04.568
and Lucius is crying for Mama.

42:05.111 --> 42:08.030
And I would rather not spend
that time talking.

42:18.875 --> 42:21.378
And I don't wanna
spend this time dancin'.

42:24.380 --> 42:28.509
<i>Japan! This week, Emperor Hirohito
and Premier Saito,</i>

42:28.509 --> 42:32.264
<i>seen here touring a military airfield
on recently captured land,</i>

42:32.264 --> 42:35.600
<i>announced that their country would be
withdrawing from the League of Nations</i>

42:35.600 --> 42:38.268
<i>after a rebuke
from the World's Western Nations</i>

42:38.603 --> 42:41.189
<i>over Japan's recent invasion
of Manchuria,</i>

42:41.189 --> 42:43.942
and its continued occupation of Korea.

42:50.447 --> 42:52.659
- Suck your dick for a quarter.
- Yeah?

42:53.702 --> 42:56.371
I'll pay you twice that not to.

43:04.878 --> 43:08.465
<i>Despite US measures to isolate
the resource-poor island nation,</i>

43:08.465 --> 43:11.469
<i>it looks like the Japanese
are gearing up for more trouble,</i>

43:11.469 --> 43:14.430
<i>and China fears
they could be next on the menu.</i>

43:48.548 --> 43:50.008
Hold on there, killer.

43:50.467 --> 43:52.761
- I just wanna talk.
- Fuck off, nigger.

43:53.385 --> 43:56.222
Now, just let me show you
what I got in the bag.

44:01.603 --> 44:03.104
Smells good, doesn't it?

44:03.521 --> 44:05.356
How often did they get the gun?

44:06.274 --> 44:09.610
Every day. All the time.
Rent the same gun for hours.

44:09.610 --> 44:11.779
Hit up the ravine, shoot bottles.

44:12.655 --> 44:14.532
So, they were practicing?

44:15.199 --> 44:16.909
Where'd they get the money?

44:17.326 --> 44:19.829
I don't care as long
as their money's good.

44:20.454 --> 44:21.455
Got another beer?

44:40.349 --> 44:41.643
Mr. Mason?

44:55.906 --> 44:56.866
Hi.

44:57.826 --> 44:58.785
Hello.

45:00.954 --> 45:01.955
I...

45:02.956 --> 45:05.457
I got your address
from the registrar's office.

45:05.457 --> 45:08.753
- Is Teddy okay?
- Yes, he's fine.

45:10.255 --> 45:13.049
I was worried
they were gonna kick him out.

45:14.216 --> 45:16.970
Well, I smoothed things over
with the school.

45:18.263 --> 45:19.598
What did you say?

45:20.140 --> 45:23.726
I told them the truth.
The other father started it.

45:31.610 --> 45:32.819
Well...

45:35.154 --> 45:37.573
I stopped and got you something. It's...

45:37.991 --> 45:40.619
French Dip from Cole's.
It was on the way.

45:42.245 --> 45:43.622
Take care.

45:46.916 --> 45:48.167
Do you wanna come in?

48:11.686 --> 48:12.896
Sofía!

48:14.856 --> 48:16.524
What do you have there?
