00:05.340 --> 00:06.800
MAN ( on radio ):
Thanks for tuning in.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.510
It's currently
five past the hour

00:08.540 --> 00:10.110
from sunny Southern California

00:10.140 --> 00:12.180
with a current temperature
of 63 degrees.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.610
And traffic is looking
pretty good right now.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.080
Just a couple of things
to report...

00:18.120 --> 00:19.680
- You're stupid!
- You're stupid.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.750
No, you're stupid.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.120
Hey, play nice,

00:22.150 --> 00:23.820
or don't play at all.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.360
Mom...

00:25.390 --> 00:27.320
I feel kinda sick.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.130
It's from reading
in the car.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.130
You should have done
your homework last night.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.630
Seriously...
it's my stomach.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.060
It really hurts.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.770
(sing-song voice):
Josh is gonna puke.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.070
Maybe it's just a bug.
You think you can go to school?

00:39.100 --> 00:42.210
I don't know.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.240
( sniffles )
I feel really weird.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.280
Honey? Have you seen my tie
with the burgundy stripes?

00:50.310 --> 00:52.450
WOMAN:
Dry cleaner.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.220
Gray and red one?

00:54.250 --> 00:55.850
( woman coughing )

00:55.890 --> 00:57.350
( muttering ):
'Cause it's not like I need them

00:57.390 --> 00:58.390
to go to work or anything.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.520
I heard that.

01:01.690 --> 01:04.260
When you told me you'd get me
a job at the store,

01:04.290 --> 01:07.300
you totally left out the part
about the graveyard shift.

01:07.330 --> 01:08.530
( chuckling ):
So?

01:08.570 --> 01:10.600
You can sleep
in all morning.

01:10.630 --> 01:12.470
I'm gonna sleep in
all week.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.570
( giggles )

01:16.810 --> 01:18.580
- Bye guys.
- Bye Mom.

01:19.910 --> 01:23.150
Honey? Honey?

01:23.180 --> 01:26.450
Oh, no! Josh,
you're really hot.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.290
I feel so cold.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.320
MAN:
You ever coming

01:30.350 --> 01:31.760
out of there, honey?

01:33.820 --> 01:34.590
Hey...

01:34.620 --> 01:36.530
( clattering, glass breaking)

01:36.560 --> 01:38.600
Are you all right?

01:41.330 --> 01:44.300
( coughing )

01:48.440 --> 01:49.610
Are you getting sick?

01:49.640 --> 01:51.340
'Cause if you are,
stay away from me.

01:51.380 --> 01:53.910
I can't afford not to go
to work tomorrow.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.750
Oh, I just need some sleep.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.280
( sighs )

01:57.310 --> 01:58.650
( coughs )

01:58.680 --> 02:01.120
That's it. I'm taking you
straight to see Dr. Burke.

02:03.820 --> 02:04.890
MAN:
Linda?

02:04.920 --> 02:06.760
Are you okay?

02:06.790 --> 02:08.430
Oh, my... Linda,
what happened?!

02:08.460 --> 02:11.760
( wheezing )
Baby, talk to me.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.130
Baby, talk to me.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.370
Hey, wake up.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.440
Bus is coming.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.480
( labored breathing )

02:26.510 --> 02:27.480
Josh?

02:27.510 --> 02:29.350
We're almost

02:29.380 --> 02:30.880
at the doctor's, okay?

02:30.910 --> 02:33.280
( labored breathing
continues )

02:57.610 --> 02:59.510
Commander Lee Havercamp,
Public Health Service.

02:59.540 --> 03:00.980
Don Eppes, FBI.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.850
Terry Lake. Good morning.

03:02.880 --> 03:06.250
Okay, our first known victim
is Joshua Kramer, 16.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.820
He got ill Saturday.
We've got about

03:07.850 --> 03:11.520
30 suspected cases in the L.A.
region, with six deaths so far.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.920
What does it look like?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.560
It's not anthrax,
it's not smallpox.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.600
Probably a pathogen,
but we haven't ruled out toxins.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.360
CDC's doing autopsies now,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
but until we can get
something definitive,

03:22.430 --> 03:24.530
we're keeping the residents
under quarantine.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.540
All right, well,
the FBI's focus

03:26.570 --> 03:28.610
will be possible
bioterrorism...

03:28.640 --> 03:29.710
where it started,

03:29.740 --> 03:31.610
a-a probable point
of release.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.410
Yes, we'll need to do
a vector analysis.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.710
To track the links
between victims?

03:34.740 --> 03:36.250
Yes, and to
predict the spread

03:36.280 --> 03:37.110
of the illness.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.680
The complexities
of the calculations

03:38.720 --> 03:40.450
require the use of
a high-level mathematician,

03:40.480 --> 03:41.920
and I've asked one to come in
on this case.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.290
DON: Actually, we deal with a
top math consultant.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.460
We can get him on it
immediately.

03:45.490 --> 03:46.590
I'd love to have him on board,

03:46.620 --> 03:49.560
but this is classified
on a National Security level.

03:49.590 --> 03:50.530
Possible bioterrorism.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.930
Right.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.600
Take a month, at least,to get a
new person cleared.

03:53.630 --> 03:54.830
clearance? already got

03:54.860 --> 03:56.300
Yes, at the highest level.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.630
Here he is now.

03:57.670 --> 03:58.770
He's a professor
from Cal-Sci.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.570
This is Dr. Charles Eppes.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.310
He'll be doing
the vector analysis.

04:06.340 --> 04:06.980
CHARLIE:
Don...

04:07.010 --> 04:07.910
Terry.

04:07.940 --> 04:08.480
Charlie.

04:08.510 --> 04:09.650
I didn't know you guys

04:09.680 --> 04:10.480
would be working on this.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.050
So, I don't understand.
You just said

04:12.080 --> 04:13.650
we need someone
with top clearance.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.880
Dr. Eppes has clearance.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.890
He does?

04:16.590 --> 04:18.520
You do?

04:18.560 --> 04:19.620
Is there a problem?

04:19.660 --> 04:21.060
You just never told me.

04:21.090 --> 04:22.660
- I wasn't supposed to.
- Right.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.790
No, Charlie is my brother,
and-and he's the consultant

04:24.830 --> 04:26.930
I was just telling you about.
I didn't realize...

04:26.960 --> 04:29.300
Here's the mother
of the dead boy.

04:29.330 --> 04:30.900
She's also displaying
the same symptoms.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.640
DON: We have to figure
out what this is

04:32.670 --> 04:33.970
before it gets
out of control.

04:58.030 --> 05:01.330
CHARLIE: We all use math every
day... every day...

05:01.370 --> 05:02.700
to predict weather...

05:02.730 --> 05:05.370
to tell time...

05:05.400 --> 05:08.000
to handle money...

05:08.040 --> 05:12.840
math is more than
formulas and equations.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.710
It's logic.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.450
math is more than
formulas and equations.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.380
It's rationality.

05:18.420 --> 05:23.590
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.560
...symptoms to look out for

05:30.590 --> 05:32.000
include aches, fever, nausea...

05:32.030 --> 05:34.900
That could just be the flu,
or a case of food poisoning.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.030
Neither of which show up
by breakfast,

05:36.070 --> 05:37.430
and both can kill you by dinner.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.000
So, whatever we're
dealing with here

05:39.040 --> 05:40.500
is fast and
it's serious.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.940
Death results
from respiratory collapse.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.810
Until we identify
what's behind this thing,

05:45.840 --> 05:48.810
we are assuming it is
an infectious agent,

05:48.850 --> 05:49.850
probably airborne,

05:49.880 --> 05:50.980
probably viral.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.080
Are we putting out any kind
of public health alert?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.720
An infectious pathogen
is categorized

05:55.750 --> 05:57.950
as a weapon of mass destruction.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.990
This investigation
is classified.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.630
Okay. And if it
keeps spreading?

06:01.660 --> 06:03.390
It is imperative

06:03.430 --> 06:05.760
that we avoid a public panic.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.430
If people leave L.A.,

06:07.460 --> 06:11.940
they will spread this contagion
faster and farther.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.840
DON: CDC and the
Public Health Service's job

06:13.870 --> 06:15.810
is to find out
what we're dealing with.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.940
The FBI's is who.

06:16.970 --> 06:18.810
And the key to both is where.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.780
Right? Where it started.

06:20.810 --> 06:22.650
Tracking
an infectious disease

06:22.680 --> 06:24.850
is a complicated
multi-variable problem.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.920
Imagine... an infected person
goes into an empty room.

06:28.950 --> 06:31.920
Four healthy people go
into the same room.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.860
Only two become infected.

06:33.890 --> 06:36.130
Then all five go into
other rooms,

06:36.160 --> 06:39.600
each joined by four more
unexposed people.

06:39.630 --> 06:42.430
More get sick, and so on.

06:42.470 --> 06:46.000
By the time you've got
100 rooms...

06:46.040 --> 06:48.100
( marker on
dry-erase board )

06:48.140 --> 06:51.170
...it's tough to track back
to that one woman.

06:51.210 --> 06:55.210
It takes complex statistical
analysis and graph theory.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.110
Not everyone that
gets exposed gets sick.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.210
Exactly. But we don't know why.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.220
And what do you know so far?

07:00.250 --> 07:01.720
We have several hot spots

07:01.750 --> 07:03.820
associated with
two or more victims.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.890
Downtown is common
to five victims.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.560
Could be a possible trend.

07:07.590 --> 07:10.490
That's too soon to know.
These are the results

07:10.530 --> 07:12.460
of a quick analysis
of the victims' activities

07:12.500 --> 07:13.400
based on
victim interviews.

07:13.430 --> 07:15.200
So, there's no significant
commonalities,

07:15.230 --> 07:19.100
but I hope that as more people
get sick, we'll find some.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.670
Not that I hope
more people get sick.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.870
DON:
We know, Charlie.

07:21.910 --> 07:23.640
It sounds like what you're
saying is you need more data.

07:23.670 --> 07:24.810
Exactly. Thank you.

07:24.840 --> 07:29.810
Both to find the origin point,
and to track the spread.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.520
DON: In the days
leading up, did Josh go

07:32.550 --> 07:35.520
anywhere out of
the ordinary?

07:35.550 --> 07:36.620
No.

07:36.650 --> 07:39.060
My husband...

07:39.090 --> 07:42.560
came home late the night
before Josh...

07:42.590 --> 07:44.230
( wheezes )
got sick.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.130
Late... late from work?

07:46.160 --> 07:51.270
He's been in San Diego
the... last... few days.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.140
Did your wife go
anywhere out of the ordinary

07:53.170 --> 07:54.670
over the last
few days?

07:54.700 --> 07:56.210
It's been a normal week.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.780
She went to work,
I went to work.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.280
YOUNG WOMAN:
She went to the movies

08:00.310 --> 08:01.980
yesterday.

08:02.010 --> 08:04.810
But we both did, and I'm fine.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.020
HUSBAND:
Downtown.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.220
We both work downtown.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.520
The movie was in Van Nuys.

08:10.550 --> 08:11.720
Does that help?

08:13.690 --> 08:15.290
And you live in...?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.290
Hancock Park.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.190
Glendale.

08:29.170 --> 08:30.170
Hey.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.540
Hey.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.040
No classes today?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.180
Nah.

08:34.710 --> 08:36.450
You working
on something for Don?

08:36.480 --> 08:37.680
It's a, um...

08:37.710 --> 08:39.750
it's a genetics project

08:39.780 --> 08:40.820
for a...
for a friend

08:40.850 --> 08:42.320
in the bio department, actually.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.520
Ah.
A he or a she?

08:43.550 --> 08:44.520
Huh?

08:44.550 --> 08:46.360
Your friend-- male or female?

08:46.390 --> 08:47.520
Does it matter?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.560
No, of course not.
I was just curious.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.530
I just thought maybe,
you know...

08:51.560 --> 08:54.530
Well, listen, Dad,
whenever I have a girlfriend,

08:54.560 --> 08:56.330
I will let you know by, um...

08:56.370 --> 08:58.400
by putting a note
on the refrigerator.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.700
Good. Well, that's nice.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.210
Uh, where you going right now?

09:02.240 --> 09:03.370
My book club.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.640
Mm-hmm, and
where's that?

09:04.670 --> 09:06.640
Phil's house.
Raymond Avenue.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.310
You keeping track of me?

09:08.340 --> 09:09.680
( chuckles ):
No.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.150
I'm just curious.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.750
Oh.
( chuckles )

09:12.780 --> 09:15.550
( door shuts )

09:15.580 --> 09:17.420
DAVID:
No claims of responsibility

09:17.450 --> 09:18.790
by any groups,
domestic or international.

09:18.820 --> 09:19.720
Right, well,
if it were

09:19.760 --> 09:21.760
terrorism, somebody
would be taking credit.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.860
They would be putting forth
a philosophy, an agenda...

09:23.890 --> 09:26.100
Unless they're no longer
around to take credit.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.100
Because they're infected,
maybe dead.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.270
Maybe.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.270
Just a thought, but we're
assuming there's a bad guy.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.240
I mean, in this type of case,
there might not be one.

09:34.270 --> 09:35.800
It's also possible
we're just looking

09:35.840 --> 09:37.510
for the wrong kind of bad guy.

09:37.540 --> 09:38.770
Well, until the CDC
determines otherwise,

09:38.810 --> 09:42.210
we're going to have to assume
somebody did this.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.210
CHARLIE: This Geographic
Information System

09:44.250 --> 09:47.380
will allows us to map victims
and potential disease clusters

09:47.420 --> 09:50.650
with real-time data.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.490
They're all over the L.A. area,

09:52.520 --> 09:55.860
from Long Beach
to Santa Barbara.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.160
Now, in computing
the reproductive ratio...

09:58.190 --> 09:59.360
Actually, you know what?

09:59.400 --> 10:00.730
I've written it out.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.670
Oh, sure, that helps.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.770
Yeah.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.770
This is an S.I.R. model.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.470
Susceptible Infectious
Recovered--

10:10.510 --> 10:12.180
used in conjunction
with the G.I.S.--

10:12.210 --> 10:13.910
will work to learn
two key things.

10:13.940 --> 10:14.840
What's the source?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.280
Is it a person
or a place?

10:17.310 --> 10:19.620
What the CDC calls
a Patient Zero.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.220
And where is it going?

10:21.250 --> 10:24.750
Where are the new patients
we need to find?

10:27.690 --> 10:28.790
Looks sort of like a plant.

10:28.820 --> 10:32.160
That's a great way to think
about it-- like a plant.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.700
A virus spreads out.
It grows, so to speak.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.870
Branching is a common pattern
in nature,

10:36.900 --> 10:39.170
from crystals
to giant redwoods.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.340
Now, we don't have enough data
to locate where it started

10:42.370 --> 10:44.210
or to fully predict the spread.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.810
Once we do, we'll know the shape
of the leaves and branches.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.250
HAVERCAMP:
How's it going?

10:49.280 --> 10:50.780
Uh, good. Any more
data on the victims?

10:50.810 --> 10:51.910
11 more.

10:54.650 --> 10:55.880
This is interesting.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.220
A woman who picked up
her daughter

10:58.250 --> 10:59.920
at the Glendale
Amtrak station...

10:59.960 --> 11:03.260
a man who had lunch
on Olvera Street...

11:03.290 --> 11:05.230
a cab driver.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.260
A cab driver.
Commander Havercamp?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.900
This material just pushed us
over the tipping point.

11:11.930 --> 11:13.440
See it?

11:13.470 --> 11:14.970
The commonality
of location.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.910
DAVID:
It's like two trees

11:16.940 --> 11:19.210
growing from
the same root, right?

11:19.240 --> 11:20.640
One to the north,
and it's one south.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.650
Both starting at
Union Station.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.380
We have 12 victims
that were either there,

11:25.410 --> 11:28.620
near there, or picked somebody
up who had been there.

11:28.650 --> 11:29.920
Makes sense.

11:29.950 --> 11:33.760
Busy transportation hub,
people coming and going.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.240
Don?

11:47.270 --> 11:48.770
I'm not so sure about
this finding.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.240
You know, I haven't had time
to test its accuracy.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.880
And if I'm-I'm worried
that if I'm wrong,

11:52.910 --> 11:54.740
the projected pattern
of spread will miss

11:54.780 --> 11:55.940
too many infected people.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.550
Right. Well, Charlie, test away.
But we can't afford to wait.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.980
( phone rings )
Eppes.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.980
TERRY:
We've closed Union Station.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.950
Cover story being given out is
asbestos was found in the walls.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.090
The station fits
the profile

12:05.120 --> 12:07.320
of a place to release a virus
for maximum dispersal.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.790
Right, which is what
I said to Charlie.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.960
- It made no impression.
- It wouldn't.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.500
You were speaking terrorism;
he was speaking math.

12:13.530 --> 12:17.000
Hey.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.270
CHARLIE: I just got off the
phone with Havercamp.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.200
And...?

12:19.230 --> 12:22.270
The infectious agent
is the pandemic flu.

12:22.310 --> 12:23.540
What?!
A flu?

12:23.570 --> 12:25.540
Pandemic?
The Spanish flu?

12:25.570 --> 12:26.910
Spanish flu.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.610
In 1918 it was
a global epidemic.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.380
It's extremely virulent,
extremely deadly.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.880
The Spanish flu killed
a disproportionate number

12:33.920 --> 12:35.980
of healthy adults.
It left towns half empty.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.520
What did they do in 1918?
How'd they stop it?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.460
Nothing. There's no cure.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.460
They just waited till
the virus burned out.

12:43.490 --> 12:44.530
How many died?

12:44.560 --> 12:45.930
In the United States?

12:45.960 --> 12:46.660
600,000.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.930
In six months.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.870
In six months?!

13:06.120 --> 13:07.950
I think we have
to tell him, Don.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.050
We can't,
it's against the law.

13:09.090 --> 13:11.760
It's his day to volunteer
at the skid row shelter

13:11.790 --> 13:15.390
downtown, like, five blocks
from Union Station.

13:15.430 --> 13:16.730
Well, so what?

13:16.760 --> 13:18.400
Traffic downtown's
always terrible.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.530
It's worse than usual.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.830
There's a Sig Alert because of
an accident on the 2,

13:21.870 --> 13:23.570
and you'll blow your
whole day in the car.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.970
And then downtown,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.070
isn't there's that, uh...?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.500
Yeah, there's
that protest march.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.040
Right. Foreign
trade subsidies.

13:29.070 --> 13:31.380
It's a big deal, they're
expecting thousands of people.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.340
It's a big deal.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.680
Meanwhile you could be
doing something fun.

13:34.710 --> 13:37.810
Hey, hey, like, I don't know,
you could go... bowling.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.750
Bowling?

13:39.780 --> 13:40.950
Or golf.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.920
You keep saying
you're going to play golf.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.450
It's a beautiful day
for a round or two.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.890
It's been two years
since I retired,

13:45.920 --> 13:47.590
and almost a year
since your mother died.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.430
Now I'm finding there
are certain things

13:49.460 --> 13:50.460
I would like to do
with my life.

13:50.490 --> 13:51.960
And one of them
is to volunteer

13:52.000 --> 13:52.960
where people need me.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.060
I've made a commitment
to be someplace today,

13:55.100 --> 13:56.770
and if that means
sitting in my car, fine.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.940
But I'm certainly not going
to skip out to go golfing...

13:58.970 --> 14:00.440
or bowling.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.640
- What if we told you...
- Charlie--

14:02.670 --> 14:04.540
there's a really good
reason you shouldn't.

14:04.570 --> 14:07.780
Charlie!

14:07.810 --> 14:10.550
Well, clearly there's something
you're not telling me.

14:12.150 --> 14:15.020
That you can't tell me.

14:15.050 --> 14:16.620
But you don't want me
to go downtown?

14:17.990 --> 14:18.890
Yeah.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.690
I think it's a good idea
not to go downtown.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.790
Okay, can we
leave it at that?

14:27.760 --> 14:30.970
Well, I'll take your concerns
under consideration.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.370
Wish we could tell Dad

14:34.400 --> 14:35.910
not to leave the house
for a couple weeks.

14:35.940 --> 14:38.510
Right. Well,
good luck with that.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.110
I've gone months without
leaving the house in the past.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.980
"Bowling."

14:42.010 --> 14:45.010
Yeah. Bowling.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.750
CHARLIE:
And I could've suggested

14:46.780 --> 14:48.420
that Dad take
a yoga class.

14:48.450 --> 14:49.750
Oh, yeah, he'd be right
out of the door then.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.020
Hey. The virus may have been
created in a lab.

14:52.060 --> 14:54.520
Four bio-labs are working
with strains of Spanish flu.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.060
One of them is here
in Los Angeles.

14:56.090 --> 14:59.700
The doctor supervising
the research is Clarence Weaver.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.570
50 years ago, scientists
uncovered victims

15:02.600 --> 15:04.030
of the 1918 pandemic

15:04.070 --> 15:05.840
from the Alaskan
permafrost.

15:05.870 --> 15:10.010
They found intact pieces of
Spanish flu RNA in the lungs

15:10.040 --> 15:12.710
of a young soldier
who was killed by the disease.

15:12.740 --> 15:13.710
So, what, you're saying

15:13.740 --> 15:15.650
you resurrected
the 1918 strain?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.710
Viral pathogens can exist

15:17.750 --> 15:19.550
for decades
hidden in nature,

15:19.580 --> 15:21.080
only to suddenly reenter

15:21.120 --> 15:22.690
the human population.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.490
Ebola virus crops up
periodically in Africa.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.530
Eventually, at some point,

15:28.560 --> 15:30.730
the Spanish flu
is bound to reemerge,

15:30.760 --> 15:31.700
and in a major outbreak.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.960
And without a vaccine
we're talking about

15:34.000 --> 15:34.960
a global epidemic.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.630
That's why
we've revived the virus.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.170
The pharmaceutical
companies will need it

15:39.200 --> 15:41.710
to develop a vaccine specific
to the Spanish flu.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.240
I'll want to review your
security measures

15:43.270 --> 15:44.440
and your inventory.

15:44.470 --> 15:47.480
Now you'd know if any Gen-0
samples were missing. I mean...

15:47.510 --> 15:48.980
No. No.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.050
We're obligated by law

15:50.080 --> 15:52.380
to report any losses
to the CDC.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.490
And what about personnel,
have they gone on vacation,

15:55.520 --> 15:57.950
anybody called in sick,
anything like that?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.690
Uh... no, not recently.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.530
Only three of us
work with the strain--

16:01.560 --> 16:03.460
Martin Grolsch...h analyst,

16:03.490 --> 16:05.530
"Grolsch."

16:05.560 --> 16:08.300
and Jessica Avery,
a microbiologist on loan

16:08.330 --> 16:09.970
from Mount Sinai
School of Medicine.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.900
No. That's impossible.

16:11.940 --> 16:13.070
Why do you say that?

16:13.100 --> 16:15.540
Because the
Spanish flu pathogen

16:15.570 --> 16:18.070
is handled only
by experienced professionals.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.440
There are protocols.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.980
A release can't just "happen."

16:21.010 --> 16:22.050
You're saying any release

16:22.080 --> 16:24.500
would have to be the result
of a deliberate act.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.620
The people in this field
who have access to the virus,

16:27.650 --> 16:29.290
they would not do that.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.620
You're sure?

16:31.660 --> 16:32.560
You know all of them?

16:32.590 --> 16:36.330
Many of them,
yes, as a matter of fact.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.000
And those that I don't know
work for people I do know.

16:39.030 --> 16:42.400
They all understand the stakes.

16:42.430 --> 16:43.970
What you're suggesting

16:44.000 --> 16:45.940
just isn't possible.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.750
Profile her for me.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.820
Yeah. Uh... fascinating.

16:59.850 --> 17:03.290
She's created a mythological
self-image of the scientist

17:03.320 --> 17:05.420
- as dispassionate god.
- You like her for this?

17:05.450 --> 17:08.190
I find the idea of
a "medical hero" interesting.

17:08.220 --> 17:09.360
Like an arsonist
who sets a fire

17:09.390 --> 17:12.660
so he can be the first person
on a scene to report it.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.700
I don't know,
I guess it's a cliché,

17:14.730 --> 17:16.330
but I tend to think of
mad scientists

17:16.370 --> 17:18.330
as... as madder than that.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.400
Extremists don't have to be
drooling, wild-eyed maniacs.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.410
They're often acting out of
sincere, if misguided, beliefs.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.670
When they tell you
why they did it,

17:24.710 --> 17:26.340
they expect you
to understand.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.080
We'll you're gonna have
to give me a motivation

17:28.110 --> 17:29.310
that will seem rational
to someone like her.

17:29.350 --> 17:31.180
Exposing the dangers
of viral research?

17:31.210 --> 17:32.450
Forcing more
federal funding?

17:32.480 --> 17:33.720
I'd like to run down
that angle.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.920
All right, I'm going to see the
other guy that works in the lab,

17:36.950 --> 17:39.420
see where he fits in
the sane-to-wild-eyed spectrum.

17:39.620 --> 17:40.580
See you later.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.140
My reaction?

17:42.490 --> 17:43.730
My reaction is...

17:43.760 --> 17:44.790
"whoa."

17:44.830 --> 17:46.130
You sure it's the Spanish flu?

17:46.160 --> 17:47.900
Oh, yeah.
We're sure.

17:47.930 --> 17:50.200
What kind of question is that?
Of course, you're sure.

17:50.230 --> 17:51.070
Whoa.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.070
And you do work closely
with the virus.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.270
Are you kidding?

17:54.300 --> 17:57.410
I know its gene fragments
better than my own girlfriend.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.240
Are you looking for
something in particular?

18:00.740 --> 18:01.810
Not really.

18:01.850 --> 18:03.910
Though I did notice
an open suitcase on your bed.

18:03.950 --> 18:07.350
Yeah, I'm flying back east
for a high school reunion.

18:07.380 --> 18:08.850
Which one?

18:08.890 --> 18:10.050
Which high school?

18:10.090 --> 18:11.420
Which reunion?

18:11.450 --> 18:12.820
15th.

18:12.860 --> 18:14.720
What year'd you graduate?

18:14.760 --> 18:15.990
1990. Look...

18:16.030 --> 18:18.230
I know you're here
because I work at Gen-0,

18:18.260 --> 18:19.930
but I didn't do it.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.460
Do what?

18:21.500 --> 18:22.370
Release the virus.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.470
How'd you know it was loose?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.240
Well, why else would you
be here talking to me

18:27.270 --> 18:28.200
about the Spanish flu?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.870
Besides, the word is out
in the bio community.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.410
We're gonna need the names
of everyone you've spoken to.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.380
Come on,
it's not against the law

18:35.410 --> 18:37.810
for a bunch of lab techs
to exchange information.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.980
You gotta admit, this is
pretty major information.

18:40.020 --> 18:41.750
Why is that you don't seem
too concerned?

18:41.790 --> 18:42.850
Are you kidding?

18:42.890 --> 18:44.890
I know this bug better than you,

18:44.920 --> 18:47.290
I know exactly
how dangerous it is, okay?

18:47.320 --> 18:48.520
I am freaked.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.230
But?

18:49.260 --> 18:52.000
Well, if it's in the population,

18:52.030 --> 18:54.130
outside the lab taking lives,

18:54.160 --> 18:57.530
then the rush to develop
a vaccine is very urgent.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.370
The major pharmaceutical
companies,

18:59.400 --> 19:02.410
they rely on labs like ours
to provide the pathogen.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.170
( sighs )

19:04.210 --> 19:05.240
Can...

19:05.270 --> 19:06.410
I'm sorry,
can you not do that?

19:06.440 --> 19:08.440
He's just doing his job.
Actually, I'd like

19:08.480 --> 19:10.110
to take a look upstairs
if that's okay.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.420
Actually, no, it's not.

19:12.450 --> 19:13.980
I haven't done anything wrong,

19:14.020 --> 19:15.350
and I'd like you
to leave.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.850
You sure about that?

19:17.890 --> 19:21.020
I can't stress how serious
a matter this is, sir.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.060
Believe me, it's my big shot.

19:24.090 --> 19:25.430
My whole career is
riding on this outbreak.

19:28.260 --> 19:29.470
If it doesn't kill me first.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.440
Let's go.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.470
Thanks for your time.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.370
Grolsch
is definitely out there.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.510
Which doesn't
make him guilty,

19:38.540 --> 19:40.410
but he did have access
to the pathogen,

19:40.440 --> 19:42.850
and he does live spitting
distance to Union Station.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.410
What worries me is that the CDC

19:44.450 --> 19:46.080
found no trace
of the virus there.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.320
Well, Havercamp said it can't
live outside the body

19:48.350 --> 19:49.520
but for a few minutes.

19:49.550 --> 19:52.560
What if we're wrong about Union
Station in the first place?

19:52.590 --> 19:54.990
Charlie, look, it is
a classic dispersal site.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.290
I mean, especially
if we're dealing with

19:56.330 --> 19:58.430
an intentional release.

19:58.460 --> 19:59.460
Maybe.
But too few of the victims

19:59.500 --> 20:00.460
have direct links
to the trains.

20:02.130 --> 20:04.100
( sighs )

20:05.870 --> 20:07.370
You all right?

20:07.400 --> 20:09.910
Every minute that goes by...

20:09.940 --> 20:11.880
I know, I know, people are
getting sick out there.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.580
We're doing what we can.
We're dealing.

20:13.610 --> 20:17.080
Father, mothers,
their children...

20:17.110 --> 20:18.580
How do you forgive yourself
if you're wrong?

20:18.610 --> 20:20.520
You don't.
We can't be wrong.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.420
Larry...

20:28.460 --> 20:30.260
you have a minute?

20:30.290 --> 20:31.590
Yes, because
we all have exactly

20:31.630 --> 20:34.130
the same number of
minutes, at all times.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.160
Do we not?
Oh, my.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.300
Listen, I am working
on a statistical analysis

20:39.340 --> 20:42.110
that involves complex variables
and multiple vectors.

20:42.140 --> 20:46.210
I've come up with a solution
as to the zero point, but, um...

20:46.240 --> 20:48.510
the experts in the field
think it's right,

20:48.540 --> 20:50.910
and I... in fact, they're
quite sure of it, but, um...

20:50.950 --> 20:52.120
But you think it's wrong.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.280
But you don't trust yourself

20:53.320 --> 20:56.050
because the experts know
the field better than you do.

20:56.090 --> 20:58.620
To be honest, the answer
does seem quite logical.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.890
Charles, you're making
the assumption that these people

21:00.920 --> 21:03.160
know their field as well
as you know math.

21:03.190 --> 21:05.290
And that's an assumption
I find tremendously problematic.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.600
Well...

21:06.630 --> 21:09.470
And how can
something be logical

21:09.500 --> 21:11.630
and mathematically suspect?

21:11.670 --> 21:15.640
I mean, as you are so fond
of saying, math is logic.

21:15.670 --> 21:19.310
Right, but in
this particular case...

21:19.340 --> 21:22.580
You know,
the most fascinating aspect

21:22.610 --> 21:24.610
of this entire
conversation for me

21:24.650 --> 21:27.080
is how careful you are
not to give specifics

21:27.120 --> 21:29.150
about what the problem is.

21:29.190 --> 21:30.250
Now since you tend

21:30.290 --> 21:32.390
to over-describe whatever
it is you're working on,

21:32.420 --> 21:34.690
I'm guessing that
you're not telling me

21:34.720 --> 21:35.590
because you can't.

21:35.620 --> 21:38.090
I would certainly love to...

21:38.130 --> 21:40.130
Na, na, na.
Don't even... don't bother.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.170
My answer to you
is still the same.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.200
Go back to the data.

21:44.230 --> 21:47.500
Right. Okay, okay,
of course.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.500
Of course.
Thank you.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.370
Let me ask one thing.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.010
When you met me just now,

21:52.040 --> 21:54.610
was I going out or
coming into the library?

21:54.640 --> 21:55.980
Larry, you were coming out.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.450
Oh... my memory's a memory.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.680
All right.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.920
Larry, you were coming out.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.620
LARRY:
Go back to the data.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.730
HAVERCAMP: Patient Zero might
have just

22:11.760 --> 22:13.360
come in from somewhere.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.430
Or if it's
an intentional release,

22:15.460 --> 22:17.730
a central somewhere.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.000
It's a classic dispersal site.

22:19.040 --> 22:24.510
Busy transportation hub,
people coming and going.

22:24.540 --> 22:27.410
CHARLIE:
The virus was at Union Station,

22:27.440 --> 22:30.010
but that's not where it started.

22:30.050 --> 22:31.710
The source point is
the downtown main bus terminal.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.450
But the CDC and the
Public Health Service

22:33.480 --> 22:35.180
are sure about
Union Station.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.720
They say it's a logical place
for someone to release a virus.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.620
But if they don't understand the
motivation behind the release,

22:40.660 --> 22:42.430
then how can they say
it's a logical place

22:42.460 --> 22:44.390
to release it?

22:44.430 --> 22:46.100
I see your point.

22:46.130 --> 22:48.700
- Here's Union Station. Right?
- Right.

22:48.730 --> 22:51.070
Here's the pattern
of the pathogen. Remember,

22:51.100 --> 22:53.570
like an oak tree growing north,
its reflection growing south.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.040
Yes, I get that part,
Charlie.

22:55.070 --> 22:56.110
What happened
to east and west?

22:56.140 --> 23:00.740
Why isn't the virus
spreading in all directions?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.680
Because it wasn't released
on a train...

23:02.710 --> 23:05.150
we would've found illnesses
among passengers.

23:05.180 --> 23:08.350
So how do we explain why
the virus spreads north

23:08.380 --> 23:09.490
and south?

23:09.520 --> 23:12.290
Well, I don't know, but
Union Station is definitely

23:12.320 --> 23:13.790
a point of commonality
for the victims.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.260
I mean, it may not be
the only one, right?

23:15.290 --> 23:16.560
I'll give you that.

23:16.590 --> 23:18.660
And it may not even
be the biggest one.

23:18.690 --> 23:21.460
Let's see what happens
when I adjust the vector track

23:21.500 --> 23:23.100
to the downtown main
bus terminal.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.740
( typing )

23:35.780 --> 23:38.410
See, now this model incorporates
more of the cases,

23:38.450 --> 23:40.280
36% more, to be exact.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.120
DON:
So what does that mean?

23:42.150 --> 23:44.150
More sick people will be linked
to the bus terminal

23:44.190 --> 23:45.550
than to the train station.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.820
Well, you know, Amtrak actually
shuttles people in buses.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.730
So even if it wasn't
released at Union Station,

23:50.760 --> 23:53.060
it's still a place where
infected people would wind up.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.260
Right. Where you couldn't
find patterns

23:55.300 --> 23:57.070
linked to specific trains,

23:57.100 --> 23:58.270
I do believe
you will find patterns

23:58.300 --> 24:01.070
linked to specific buses--
one heading north, one south.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.810
And this is something
I don't understand.

24:02.840 --> 24:03.970
What-- am I reading this right,

24:04.010 --> 24:06.540
that people to the north
are getting sicker than people

24:06.580 --> 24:07.160
to the south?

24:07.320 --> 24:09.680
80% of the deaths link
to the north pattern.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.450
But that doesn't make sense.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.080
How can the people
to the north

24:13.120 --> 24:14.550
be more vulnerable
to the same virus?

24:14.580 --> 24:19.460
What if it isn't
the same virus?

24:19.490 --> 24:22.260
What if there's
two different viruses?

24:30.170 --> 24:32.800
HAVERCAMP: There's two strains
of the same virus...

24:32.840 --> 24:35.700
traveling in two
different directions.

24:35.740 --> 24:40.710
The differences
to their structure is small...

24:40.740 --> 24:42.310
the differences to
their impact

24:42.350 --> 24:43.810
on the population
is significant.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.710
What's the likelihood
of two strains

24:45.750 --> 24:47.880
appearing naturally, in the same
place at the same time?

24:47.920 --> 24:50.590
A statistical impossibility.

24:50.620 --> 24:53.220
So it was released
deliberately by someone.

24:53.260 --> 24:57.290
I just don't understand
two strains.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.360
( phone rings )
Eppes.

25:01.430 --> 25:02.800
Right.

25:02.830 --> 25:04.700
Got Atlanta on the
teleconference.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.670
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

25:07.700 --> 25:10.410
They are two different strains
of the Spanish flu.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.840
The incongruity is genetic,
one gene in particular.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.910
But when Gen-0 resurrected
the Spanish Flu,

25:15.940 --> 25:18.450
they didn't bring back
the actual thing.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.320
They stitched together
RNA fragments

25:21.350 --> 25:23.150
from a standard lab flu strain

25:23.190 --> 25:25.520
with genes from the 1918 flu.

25:25.550 --> 25:27.660
The other strain uses less
of the RNA

25:27.690 --> 25:29.630
from the original pandemic flu.

25:29.660 --> 25:32.230
And as we can see from
the pattern of deaths,

25:32.260 --> 25:33.200
it's less virulent.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.900
Do we know who manufactured
the first one?

25:34.930 --> 25:36.270
The less lethal one?

25:36.300 --> 25:37.330
Yes.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.840
It carries genetic markers
unique to Russell Labs

25:40.870 --> 25:41.840
in Maryland.

25:41.870 --> 25:43.070
But the CDC has no record

25:43.110 --> 25:46.480
of a sample being removed or
transported from Russell Labs.

25:46.510 --> 25:47.710
But it is here,

25:47.740 --> 25:50.450
along with another one
from Gen-0's L.A. lab.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.960
HAVERCAMP: The virus was
released via aerosol spray

26:05.990 --> 26:08.730
on two buses, one northbound,
one southbound.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.330
The father of the first victim,
Joshua Kramer,

26:11.370 --> 26:13.900
he rode a
northbound bus.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.770
But only his wife and
oldest son got sick.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.340
The other two children
seem okay.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.240
All right. We better start
running down everybody

26:20.280 --> 26:21.180
who was in and out
of that terminal

26:21.210 --> 26:22.380
on the day the virus
was likely released.

26:22.410 --> 26:24.310
We'll get the county

26:24.350 --> 26:26.520
public health department, LAPD,
county sheriff's...

26:26.550 --> 26:28.220
everybody just moving on it,
right?

26:28.250 --> 26:29.890
HAVERCAMP: Well, now that
we know about the buses,

26:29.920 --> 26:32.220
we can find victims
we might have missed.

26:32.260 --> 26:33.890
That means getting them help
sooner.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.960
All right. Good.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.390
Stop the spread.

26:36.430 --> 26:37.360
Bus terminal
director's

26:37.390 --> 26:39.260
compiling security videos

26:39.300 --> 26:40.160
onto discs.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.730
We'll get it as soon
as possible, Don.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.800
All right. Good.

26:42.830 --> 26:45.200
I'm gonna get them
moving on that.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.170
CHARLIE:
Hey.

26:49.210 --> 26:50.340
Where've you been?

26:50.370 --> 26:51.410
Uh, bowling.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.610
Really?

26:52.640 --> 26:54.940
No, of course not.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.580
I was downtown
at the shelter.

26:56.610 --> 26:57.610
Dad...

26:57.650 --> 26:59.650
Well, no one else seems worried
about being there.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.720
That's because
they didn't know.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.990
Didn't know what you
wouldn't tell me?

27:05.020 --> 27:08.120
Look, if everybody can be down
there, why can't I?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.590
I got this fuzzy feeling
you and your brother

27:09.630 --> 27:11.960
have been going downtown,
too. Huh, am I right?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.030
Okay. But we were...
we were worried about you.

27:14.060 --> 27:15.130
Do you understand?

27:15.160 --> 27:16.530
Look, Charlie,

27:16.570 --> 27:18.070
your brother puts himself
on the line every day

27:18.100 --> 27:18.970
on that job of his.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.440
Don't you think I'm worried
about him?

27:20.470 --> 27:21.700
Huh?

27:21.740 --> 27:23.370
But I know how vital
that job is to him.

27:25.740 --> 27:28.640
You've been helping him out
a bit lately, haven't you?

27:28.680 --> 27:31.080
You know what I'm really
proud of?

27:31.110 --> 27:32.550
I'm proud

27:32.580 --> 27:35.750
that I've raised two sons...
well, we've raised two sons

27:35.780 --> 27:38.290
who have a great sense
of public service.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.320
( coughing )

27:42.760 --> 27:44.330
You okay?

27:44.360 --> 27:45.630
Huh? Yeah, sure.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.100
It's just a cough.

27:47.130 --> 27:48.130
Be careful.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.270
It's, uh... it's flu season.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.000
Yeah, well,
don't worry about me.

27:52.040 --> 27:52.970
I never get the flu.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.780
HAVERCAMP: Because these flu
viruses are so similar,

28:00.810 --> 28:04.750
sometimes we can use
the less virulent strain

28:04.780 --> 28:07.120
to make vaccines and treatments
for the deadly ones.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.450
CHARLIE:
But you can't cure

28:10.490 --> 28:11.350
viral infections.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.590
No, we can't, but we
do have therapies

28:13.620 --> 28:16.130
that reduce the symptoms
of some strains.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.730
This is Russell's strain,
yeah?

28:18.760 --> 28:20.330
And this is Gen-O's.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.400
That's the more
deadly strain.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.540
Quantifying
the difference

28:32.580 --> 28:34.310
between the two strains
can take months.

28:34.340 --> 28:35.780
Well, I'm just doing
a rough analysis

28:35.810 --> 28:38.750
to get sort of a simplified
perspective of the differences

28:38.780 --> 28:40.720
'cause I'm just curious.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.730
The way you've
simplified it...

28:49.760 --> 28:54.500
I can see a similarity
to the protein signature

28:54.530 --> 28:55.530
from yet
another strain.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.770
We've got a treatment
for that.

28:56.800 --> 28:57.800
It's a long shot,

28:57.830 --> 29:01.400
but they're so close

29:01.440 --> 29:03.470
it's possible
to use the therapies

29:03.510 --> 29:07.510
to cure
the Spanish flu victims.

29:09.580 --> 29:10.780
DON:
I got Dr. Weaver here

29:10.810 --> 29:12.820
who has something he thinks
might be very important to us.

29:12.850 --> 29:14.380
WEAVER:
It occurred to me

29:14.420 --> 29:15.850
that these
might be helpful

29:15.880 --> 29:18.150
in identifying the
specific viral strain.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.390
Slides of the five known
Spanish flu strains.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.160
They might help you
in identifying

29:23.190 --> 29:24.690
where the virus
originated.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.230
Thank you very much
for bringing this down here.

29:26.260 --> 29:27.860
We appreciate it.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.100
Under the circumstances,
it's the least I could do.

29:30.130 --> 29:31.430
And I know

29:31.470 --> 29:32.870
that during an investigation,

29:32.900 --> 29:34.840
the FBI has to do
its due diligence,

29:34.870 --> 29:36.510
but, uh, I would like
to take this opportunity

29:36.540 --> 29:39.140
to speak on behalf of
my research associates.

29:39.180 --> 29:41.880
trustworthy people.ompetent,

29:41.910 --> 29:44.250
Of course.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.220
Especially Martin Grolsch.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.220
I know he might
seem a bit odd,

29:48.250 --> 29:49.650
but he's a top
bio-technician;

29:49.690 --> 29:51.220
ambitious and
dedicated to his work.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.260
Right.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.260
I simply can't imagine that
he would have anything to do

29:55.290 --> 29:56.890
with releasing
a virulent pathogen.

29:56.930 --> 29:58.890
Well, we will definitely
take that into consideration,

29:58.930 --> 30:00.160
but we got a lot
to do here

30:00.200 --> 30:01.500
so I'm going
to see you out.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.200
Okay, I'm sitting
in a black hole.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.910
I'm looking at you;
what do I see?

30:09.940 --> 30:12.580
Everything...
and nothing.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.640
But are we talking about
a charged black hole

30:14.680 --> 30:15.580
in anti-de-sitter
space?

30:15.610 --> 30:19.480
No, just a run-of-the-Yang-Mills
black hole.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.820
( all chuckle )

30:21.920 --> 30:22.920
Larry.

30:22.950 --> 30:24.390
LARRY:
Charles...

30:24.420 --> 30:25.850
would you care to join our

30:25.890 --> 30:27.460
String Theory
Lunch Club?

30:27.490 --> 30:31.230
Sure.

30:31.260 --> 30:33.430
I just wanted
to thank you.

30:33.460 --> 30:37.530
Your advice on
the problem I had...

30:37.570 --> 30:39.300
really worked out.

30:39.340 --> 30:42.270
Okay. Well, the scientific
method works every now and then,

30:42.310 --> 30:43.440
if you give it a chance.

30:43.470 --> 30:46.210
It helped, uh,
a lot of people.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.510
I wish I could
tell you more.

30:50.410 --> 30:53.550
You know, when I first
started out teaching,

30:53.580 --> 30:56.090
there were still many scientists
who'd worked at Los Alamos,

30:56.120 --> 30:57.320
and there were things that

30:57.350 --> 30:58.990
they couldn't talk about--

30:59.020 --> 31:01.660
this was after
30 years--

31:01.690 --> 31:03.230
so let's just hope that

31:03.260 --> 31:05.700
your secret has
a shorter half-life.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.700
And doesn't kill
as many people

31:07.730 --> 31:10.500
as the atomic bomb.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.270
DON: You serve the warrant on
Grolsch?

31:14.300 --> 31:15.410
No. He wasn't there.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.240
We posted it
and went in.

31:16.270 --> 31:18.540
You said he referred to
a girlfriend?

31:18.580 --> 31:19.540
Yeah, he did.

31:19.580 --> 31:20.410
He made, uh,
what was it--

31:20.440 --> 31:22.180
some joke about not
seeing her much.

31:22.210 --> 31:24.180
Probably due to the fact
she dumped him a month ago.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.280
Series of increasingly
hostile e-mail volleys

31:26.320 --> 31:27.080
ended with her
pulling the plug.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.290
Enough to push him
over the edge?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.120
I mean, is this
all about

31:29.150 --> 31:30.520
getting the attention
of a woman?

31:30.550 --> 31:32.090
No-- I think he's
a self-involved jerk;

31:32.120 --> 31:33.260
I don't see evidence
he's a sociopath.

31:33.290 --> 31:34.660
And as far as his
personal records go,

31:34.690 --> 31:37.190
Grolsch is a keeper,
not a shredder.

31:37.230 --> 31:38.230
Copies of his phone bills.

31:38.260 --> 31:39.600
We're reviewing
numbers called.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.070
So far, nothing.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.500
All right...

31:44.770 --> 31:46.300
These go back,
like, nine months.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.300
Mm.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.410
Here's a hookup charge.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.270
He moved here less
than a year ago.

31:50.310 --> 31:51.280
Could be something.

31:53.780 --> 31:55.650
DON: Mr. Grolsch, when
we spoke before,

31:55.680 --> 31:56.810
you neglected to
mention that you

31:56.850 --> 31:58.180
came to California
from Maryland.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.120
After you grabbed me,

32:00.150 --> 32:02.450
did you put my groceries
in the refrigerator?

32:02.490 --> 32:03.720
I had some frozen items
in there.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.290
DON: See, that concerns us,
because not one

32:05.320 --> 32:07.120
but two strains
of the Spanish flu

32:07.160 --> 32:08.130
have been released here.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.360
One from Gen-O

32:09.390 --> 32:11.230
and one from Russell Labs
in Maryland.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.600
Strains from both labs?

32:12.630 --> 32:13.700
You're sure?

32:13.730 --> 32:14.530
Where were you employed
back east?

32:14.560 --> 32:16.470
Russell Labs-- you know
that already,

32:16.500 --> 32:17.230
or else I wouldn't be here.

32:17.270 --> 32:18.470
You didn't tell us
that before.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.500
Well, you didn't ask before.
Look, Russell and Gen-O are in

32:20.540 --> 32:22.840
stiff competition; bio-research
is a cutthroat business.

32:22.870 --> 32:25.080
Dr. Weaver was impressed
with my credentials,

32:25.110 --> 32:26.610
and called to recruit me.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.210
You're linked to thishing,

32:28.250 --> 32:29.350
outbreak in two ways,
do you understand that?

32:29.380 --> 32:31.280
And as far as
we could tell,

32:31.320 --> 32:32.750
you're the only person
with access to both strains.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.620
Okay, no...

32:34.650 --> 32:36.150
Look, this is nuts.

32:36.190 --> 32:38.660
No, I am not
the only person.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.360
Okay, Russell and Gen-O
are both competing

32:41.390 --> 32:42.830
for the same huge
pharmaceutical contract.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.260
So when I joined Gen-O,

32:45.300 --> 32:47.360
I gave my new company a boost
by bringing along a sample

32:47.400 --> 32:49.370
of what the competition
was cooking up.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.270
TERRY: You took Russell Labs'
virus with you,

32:51.300 --> 32:52.300
across the country,

32:52.340 --> 32:54.200
when you came to
work for Gen-O?

32:54.240 --> 32:57.410
I followed the proper protocol.
There wasn't any risk.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.480
But... at least two other people
have access to both strains:

33:00.510 --> 33:01.850
Dr. Weaver

33:01.880 --> 33:03.310
and Jessica Avery.
It's not just me.

33:03.350 --> 33:04.280
Okay, all right.
Let's talk about

33:04.310 --> 33:05.320
pharmaceutical
contracts.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.480
What were the two companies in
competition for?

33:06.520 --> 33:09.390
I think maybe it's time
that I had my lawyer present.

33:09.420 --> 33:10.350
You transferred
bio-hazardous materials

33:10.390 --> 33:11.560
across several
state lines!

33:11.590 --> 33:14.390
I can't begin to tell you
the trouble that puts you in.

33:14.420 --> 33:15.830
Now, seeing how
people are dying,

33:15.860 --> 33:17.460
I suggest you
help us first,

33:17.490 --> 33:20.430
and then you talk
to your attorney.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.700
The competition
is for a contract

33:22.730 --> 33:24.300
with the company
developing the vaccine.

33:24.330 --> 33:25.340
And what's the name
of that company?

33:25.370 --> 33:26.300
CraigMac Pharmaceuticals.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.170
That's a major
manufacturer.

33:29.210 --> 33:30.470
We're talking about
a hefty contract...

33:30.510 --> 33:32.210
Hundreds of millions
of dollars

33:32.240 --> 33:33.510
over several years.

33:33.540 --> 33:34.610
So that's why
you stole the virus,

33:34.640 --> 33:36.310
to help Gen-O
and make yourself rich?

33:36.350 --> 33:37.710
It sure as hell wasn't
to release it.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.380
I don't want to kill people.

33:39.420 --> 33:42.550
Right; it's just a harmless case
of corporate espionage.

33:42.590 --> 33:43.920
Is that it?

33:43.950 --> 33:46.460
DON: You think he was desperate
enough to release both viruses

33:46.490 --> 33:48.690
just to prove Gen-O's
was more deadly?

33:48.730 --> 33:49.660
Maybe; but like he said,

33:49.690 --> 33:50.890
there's also Janice Avery
and Dr. Weaver.

33:50.930 --> 33:53.460
Somebody else might've gained
access that nobody knows about.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.900
Well, we need to find everybody
who could get to both viruses.

33:55.930 --> 33:57.300
And I want to talk
to CraigMac

33:57.330 --> 33:58.700
about that contract
he was so hot to win.

34:00.370 --> 34:01.910
DON:
As soon as that data comes in,

34:01.940 --> 34:03.910
you guys get it to me,
understand?

34:03.940 --> 34:06.140
All right, see
you in a little.

34:07.910 --> 34:09.410
Hey.

34:09.450 --> 34:11.920
( quietly ):
Hey.

34:11.950 --> 34:14.350
Hey, Havercamp tells me
they're responding to treatment,

34:14.380 --> 34:16.220
which she says
you helped identify.

34:16.250 --> 34:18.360
Good going.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.360
I'm glad I could help.

34:20.390 --> 34:22.230
You all right?

34:25.460 --> 34:28.800
Hey, Don, did, um...

34:28.830 --> 34:31.840
did Mom...

34:31.870 --> 34:34.770
did she suffer?

34:34.800 --> 34:37.410
No. No, not toward the end.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.380
I mean, not with all the
morphine she was getting.

34:41.410 --> 34:42.750
She had one of
those... those...

34:42.780 --> 34:44.680
She liked that.
Okay.

34:48.750 --> 34:51.220
Hey, I want to know

34:51.260 --> 34:54.520
how you got
a top security clearance.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.760
I did some consulting
for the NSA.

34:57.790 --> 35:00.330
The National Security Agency?

35:00.360 --> 35:02.570
Yeah, a couple years ago,

35:02.600 --> 35:04.430
uh, Bob Tomkins called me.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.600
Wait a minute.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.900
Assistant Director
Robert Tomkins?

35:07.940 --> 35:09.510
Bob. Yeah.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.240
Robert. Yeah.

35:13.710 --> 35:15.480
( laughs ):
Charlie...

35:15.510 --> 35:18.320
Do you understand, with that,
I mean, you don't even need

35:18.350 --> 35:19.880
a visitor's pass
to come to my office.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.290
You have total access.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.950
Really?
They never told me that.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.420
I mean, I...

35:26.460 --> 35:28.490
I'm just trying to get
my head around the fact

35:28.530 --> 35:30.430
that my little brother
consulted on an NSA issue

35:30.460 --> 35:32.430
that went high enough up
for you to call

35:32.460 --> 35:34.300
the assistant director
by his first name.

35:34.330 --> 35:39.300
The NSA consults
with a lot of mathematicians.

35:39.340 --> 35:40.670
You know, you've never
been really good

35:40.700 --> 35:42.340
at keeping secrets--
think about it.

35:43.770 --> 35:45.340
Charlie...

35:46.480 --> 35:47.910
( sighs )

36:04.590 --> 36:05.600
Don...

36:05.630 --> 36:06.800
we've got something.

36:10.530 --> 36:12.640
Hey, so CraigMac awarded
the contract to Russell Labs

36:12.670 --> 36:14.600
two weeks before
the virus was released.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.570
There's a formal announcement
due next week.

36:16.610 --> 36:17.570
But you said Russell Lab's germ

36:17.610 --> 36:19.510
is less deadly
than the one Gen-0 developed.

36:19.540 --> 36:21.350
I did, and it is.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.980
Right, but then the treatment
therapy would be derived

36:23.010 --> 36:24.150
from the less
potent virus.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.320
HAVERCAMP: When it comes to
corporate decision-making,

36:26.350 --> 36:27.680
other factors come into play.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.590
- Such as?
- Russell Labs might not have

36:29.620 --> 36:31.790
the best pathogen,
but they've got a CEO

36:31.820 --> 36:33.790
who's got a good contact
at the FDA.

36:33.820 --> 36:36.060
That's important to
a company like CraigMac.

36:36.090 --> 36:39.630
This blows the idea that Grolsch
was trying to win the contract.

36:39.660 --> 36:40.600
No, no, no, no, no.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.600
He did not know
that contract was awarded.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.800
They found something
on the bus depot tapes that

36:44.830 --> 36:47.000
we have to take a look at.

37:00.620 --> 37:02.890
Weaver.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.130
DON:
Come on.

37:15.230 --> 37:16.870
Come on.

37:24.980 --> 37:27.280
We got him entering
a second bus.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.980
This is a guy trusted

37:29.010 --> 37:31.620
to develop a deadly virus,
and he's releasing it.

37:31.650 --> 37:35.350
TERRY: There you go-- not a
wild-eyed crazy person.

37:35.390 --> 37:37.620
Weaver's not at home,
he's not at the office.

37:37.660 --> 37:39.090
Told the assistant he'd
be gone all afternoon.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.260
Well, let's find him now.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.730
If you reach his
voice-mail, try again.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.700
Or not.

37:47.730 --> 37:48.800
Hello?

37:48.830 --> 37:50.370
Dr. Weaver.
Agent Eppes.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.740
Yes. Good to hear from you.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.670
Hey, look, I had a
few more questions.

37:54.710 --> 37:57.010
I was wondering if I could
come down there and see you.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.210
Actually,
I'm out of the office today.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.240
Oh, really,
it'll just take a second.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.850
How about we talk
on the phone?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.050
Um, I'm driving right now.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.120
Oh. Where are you?

38:06.150 --> 38:09.050
I'd be happy to arrange a time
to see you tomorrow.

38:09.090 --> 38:10.220
Agent Eppes, I'm sorry,
I really don't like

38:10.250 --> 38:12.620
to talk on the phone when
I'm driving in city traffic.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.290
Good-bye.

38:17.290 --> 38:18.630
Where is he?

38:18.660 --> 38:19.730
Approaching Hancock Park.

38:21.430 --> 38:25.640
All right, notify LAPD and CHP--
he's in a residential district.

38:38.250 --> 38:41.120
- This is his car.
- All right.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.960
Do not move. Do not move!
Do not move.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.900
I've got the bag.

38:53.930 --> 38:56.130
curb, away from the church.the

38:56.170 --> 38:58.070
WEAVER:
Is all this truly necessary?

38:58.100 --> 38:59.770
You wanted to prove
your virus was

38:59.800 --> 39:02.340
more powerful, so you tested it
on innocent people?

39:02.370 --> 39:04.410
Yes. I had to, to save lives.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.180
Save lives?
20 people are dead.

39:06.210 --> 39:07.710
If the vaccines
and treatments

39:07.750 --> 39:09.010
are made from
the wrong pathogen,

39:09.050 --> 39:10.410
and the Spanish flu reemerges,

39:10.450 --> 39:12.020
which I assure
you it will,

39:12.050 --> 39:14.020
we will not be ready--
millions will die.

39:14.050 --> 39:15.450
So you justify these deaths to
save more lives later?

39:15.490 --> 39:17.320
If you had been around

39:17.350 --> 39:18.390
deadly pathogens
as long as I have,

39:18.420 --> 39:20.830
you would understand
that I had no choice, Agent.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.990
They are unforgiving--
we have to take every

39:23.030 --> 39:24.360
possible measure to
protect innocent people.

39:24.390 --> 39:25.960
What do you got?

39:26.000 --> 39:30.200
Candles. They're just candles.

39:30.230 --> 39:31.840
WEAVER:
Those are for

39:31.870 --> 39:33.140
the victims.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.370
I was about to light
a candle for each one.

39:36.740 --> 39:37.880
Did you think I was

39:37.910 --> 39:39.710
planning to release
the virus again?

39:39.740 --> 39:41.950
- Let's go.
- I have no reason to do that.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.110
- Let's go.
- I've already established that

39:44.150 --> 39:45.780
our strain is the more deadly--
releasing it again

39:45.820 --> 39:47.820
would be insane.

39:58.260 --> 40:00.460
So, how are you
two guys doing?

40:03.430 --> 40:05.070
Well, you seem
so much more relaxed

40:05.100 --> 40:06.470
than the last couple of days.

40:06.500 --> 40:11.210
Yeah, I'd say, uh,
we're doing pretty okay now.

40:11.240 --> 40:15.410
Finished our project.

40:15.450 --> 40:18.780
Think I might get my first good
night's sleep in about a week.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.050
I'm glad it's over.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.050
You know, I thought
I'd let you know

40:22.090 --> 40:24.390
that I'm gonna be working
down at the shelter next week.

40:24.420 --> 40:26.220
I mean, if that's okay
with the two of you.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.430
Yeah, I think
it's okay now.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.360
I think that's a good idea.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.930
I'll see you two later.

40:33.960 --> 40:36.530
I'm gonna be going somewhere
with Art Stanley.

40:36.570 --> 40:38.340
Uh-oh. What are
you two up to?

40:38.370 --> 40:40.200
Bowling.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.170
After the fuss you made,

40:42.210 --> 40:44.740
I thought I'd give it a try.

40:50.110 --> 40:51.920
I still can't believe you
never told me

40:51.950 --> 40:53.320
you consulted for the NSA.

40:53.350 --> 40:54.790
It was nothing like this,
you know?

40:54.820 --> 40:55.920
I hope not, Charlie.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.790
You know, I mean,
a lot of stuff comes

40:57.820 --> 40:59.220
across my desk--
daily Bureau briefings.

40:59.260 --> 41:00.890
Chances are,
I probably already knew

41:00.930 --> 41:01.990
about your assignment.

41:02.030 --> 41:03.890
It wasn't an assignment, really.

41:03.930 --> 41:07.900
It was, um... it was more
of a consulting gig.

41:07.930 --> 41:09.930
And it wasn't really
all that sensitive.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.940
We have troops stationed
all over the globe, right?

41:13.970 --> 41:15.440
All right, stop. Stop, stop.

41:15.470 --> 41:16.970
- No, no, no, stop, stop.
- Let me...

41:17.010 --> 41:18.240
But you just...

41:18.280 --> 41:19.580
Charlie look, don't let me play
you like that.

41:19.610 --> 41:20.680
You made an agreement
not to talk.

41:20.710 --> 41:23.050
You're right, you shouldn't.
I'm sorry, forget it.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.150
It's over. I won't ask.

41:24.180 --> 41:27.990
I know how
your mind works.

41:28.020 --> 41:29.990
I think your mind
works pretty well.

41:30.020 --> 41:32.390
All right? I wouldn't
have it any other way.

41:39.630 --> 41:42.300
Tell me what the assignment was.

41:42.330 --> 41:44.030
Wouldn't you like to know?

41:44.070 --> 41:45.140
Come on. What was it?

41:45.170 --> 41:49.610
I really can't tell you.
It's, um, it's top secret.
