00:00.935 --> 00:03.002
      (slow solemn music)

00:31.966 --> 00:33.966
   - [Man] My name is Terry.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.834
      This is my hometown.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.204
         It sits in the
       middle of nowhere.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.640
     Actually, it's in the
     middle of the desert,

00:41.642 --> 00:44.676
    right between two of the
  livest cities in the world,

00:44.678 --> 00:47.713
   Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.449
   Supply and demand of those
  two populations has made us

00:50.451 --> 00:53.318
  famous for the manufacturing
        and distribution

00:53.320 --> 00:56.622
      of one highly sought
         after product,

00:56.624 --> 01:00.359
    Crystal Methanphetamine,
  otherwise known as crystal,

01:00.361 --> 01:03.262
   speed, crank, and go fast.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.567
      One of the top three
   narcotics used in the US.

01:08.569 --> 01:12.104
 Unlike the other two, cocaine
          and heroin,

01:12.106 --> 01:15.941
 it's the only on manufactured
   right here in the states,

01:15.943 --> 01:18.610
      in what most people
        call cook towns.

01:19.747 --> 01:23.415
Mainly in secluded areas because

01:23.417 --> 01:25.384
        of the smell it
     generates when cooked.

01:29.256 --> 01:34.326
   And when the cooking of it
  goes bad, it goes real bad.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.764
          (exploding)

01:41.235 --> 01:44.369
       (deep slow music)

01:44.371 --> 01:46.839
   The only person I know to
    make it out of this town

01:46.841 --> 01:49.508
to the Vegas high life is Kelly.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.477
She taught me everything I know,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.745
   how to cook, how to sell,

01:53.747 --> 01:56.548
and how to survive in this dead
           end game.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.584
      She mastered the art
        of the come up.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.652
Now she tells high rollers what
           to bet on

02:00.654 --> 02:04.056
  and keeps her little sister,
   Keisha, right by her side.

02:04.058 --> 02:04.990
        - Good morning.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.125
        - Good morning.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.193
- All right, here's your paper.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.026
          - Thank ya.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.713
        - So primitive.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.398
   I mean, really, who still
    reads the paper anymore?

02:14.401 --> 02:15.968
            - I do.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.337
   I'm the one who does what
   everybody else doesn't do.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.273
     Them little blogs and
    websites you check out,

02:21.275 --> 02:23.459
  they don't know everything.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.644
     You gotta keep it old
  school sometimes, baby girl.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.779
      - Yeah, yeah, I hear
     you, which reminds me,

02:27.781 --> 02:30.015
I'm about to go check my Insta.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.984
     - Gotta see if you got
       any new followers?

02:31.986 --> 02:32.985
    - I got plenty of those.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.454
        - Ooh, stop it.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.623
           (laughing)

02:37.625 --> 02:38.724
Hope they bringing you a check.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.230
   - This is Mike, been right
           by my side

02:45.232 --> 02:47.499
   for the past three years.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.303
  - Oh man, why we gotta sell
    that shit on (mumbles)?

02:51.305 --> 02:52.738
     - Times is hard, man.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.506
    People need fronts just
          to move it.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.441
      - Yeah, but we stay
    chasing our money, dog.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.710
It's not even worth it no more.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.045
           - I know.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.814
     We're gonna pick up a
    big bag of some fifths,

03:02.816 --> 03:05.384
     move some weight so we
   can get back on our feet.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.488
    - Once we start fucking
  with fifths, no more shorts.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.789
     Know what I'm saying?

03:10.790 --> 03:12.089
 We're playing with our lives,
              dog.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.575
            - Yeah.

03:13.576 --> 03:15.059
     Right now, we're gonna
   mash up in this pool hall

03:15.062 --> 03:16.461
      and see if we can't
         find Spike and

03:16.463 --> 03:18.697
        get some of our
      motherfucking money.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.032
 - Oh, fuck that motherfucker.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.600
        I swear to god,
      if he says anything,

03:21.602 --> 03:22.935
        I'm gonna put a
       bullet in his ass.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.403
  - Yeah, but it will be a lot
           harder to

03:24.405 --> 03:25.904
 get that from a dead asshole.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.142
    - Half the motherfuckers
      in this rat ass town

03:30.144 --> 03:31.777
       owe us money, dog.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.680
    I say we go in there and
    take some fucking names

03:34.682 --> 03:36.848
 and we set a fucking example,
     know what I'm saying?

03:36.850 --> 03:38.917
        Fuck this shit.

03:38.919 --> 03:42.487
   (lighthearted rock music)

03:44.291 --> 03:45.324
     - All right, no balls
          dropped yet.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.692
   All bets are on right now.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.395
      - Yo, the way you've
     been shooting tonight,

03:50.397 --> 03:54.199
      you might wanna wait
     until you shoot first,

03:54.201 --> 03:56.034
     then place your bets.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.237
           (laughing)

03:58.239 --> 03:59.805
- (mumbles) I'll finish his ass
  off before he finishes that
             smoke.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.541
  - [Man] This dude's killing
           you, man.

04:07.014 --> 04:07.913
             - Wow.

04:08.916 --> 04:13.986
     (deep rhythmic music)
           (barking)

04:16.757 --> 04:17.822
       (zipper pulled up)

04:19.459 --> 04:20.358
            - Shit.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.698
      - I'm ready to sink
        this eight ball.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.532
 - Let's go in the restroom and

04:27.534 --> 04:30.102
handle some business real quick.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.770
 - I'm gambling right now, man.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.305
      You can handle your
        business later.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.008
  - Do I have to chase you all
          around town

04:36.010 --> 04:37.242
    to get my money, Spike?

04:38.445 --> 04:39.911
  - Eight ball, corner pocket.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.848
 - Really tired of chasing you,
              man.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.418
        - Yo, Hawk, this
   motherfucker's acting like

04:46.420 --> 04:47.452
      I'm running scared!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.521
     - Shit, I don't know.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.824
 But he damn sure doesn't look
   like the boogie man to me.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.898
       (glass shattering)

04:59.900 --> 05:02.034
           (yelling)

05:02.036 --> 05:03.853
     - Glad you can hear me
      better with one ear!

05:03.854 --> 05:05.671
  - This isn't how you handle
         business, man.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.573
  - I'm leaving here with this
    ear or my fucking money!

05:10.244 --> 05:11.643
  - Give him the money, baby.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.148
- You should've been said that.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.954
     - Next round's on me.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.357
      Everybody trying to
       even the trenches.

05:25.359 --> 05:28.360
 To some people, I'm the food.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.329
  Watch the fucking car, man!

05:30.331 --> 05:32.264
            - Fuck!

05:32.266 --> 05:34.299
   Get the fuck out of here!

05:34.301 --> 05:37.035
  - Man, see I told you about
   these fucking alleys, dog.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.172
      (fun rhythmic music)

05:42.076 --> 05:44.209
      There's not a whole
    lot to do in this town.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.578
    All we have is the pool
     hall, the strip club,

05:46.580 --> 05:48.780
    and a whole lot of dope.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.483
        (fun rap music)

06:09.403 --> 06:12.704
     Amanda, the best thing
   that ever happened to me.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.272
    Pure as the driven snow.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.809
  Wish she didn't have to bare
 herself in this club like this

06:17.811 --> 06:20.912
     but trying to survive
        in these towns,

06:20.914 --> 06:23.048
 requires the full effort from
          both of us.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.234
- Amanda, you leaving all ready?

06:42.236 --> 06:43.935
          - Thank god.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.037
     All these creeps wanna
    take me home with them.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.506
 It's the same thing everyday.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.575
 - Only if the price is right,
             honey.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.110
            - Never!

06:52.112 --> 06:53.245
 You look like you were making
            out with

06:53.247 --> 06:55.647
  one of those losers in VIP.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.184
      - VIP, Amanda, means
    they paid to play, duh.

07:00.154 --> 07:03.121
   - The US government could
   not print up enough money

07:03.123 --> 07:05.424
    for me to make out with
      any of those losers.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.325
 - Doesn't mean you gotta half
            ass it.

07:08.562 --> 07:12.164
  Look, I got a party tonight
 with a couple of real ballers.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.535
     Pay your bills for the
       next three months.

07:16.537 --> 07:21.139
- No, I got priorities, school,
            8:00 am.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.040
        - Such a square.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.245
- Plus, Terry's picking me up in
           a minute.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.848
      - Good, that's who I
      need to see anyway.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.216
   - Like that's what I need.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.285
     For him to get busted
          in here and

07:33.287 --> 07:35.787
 then how are we gonna survive?

07:35.789 --> 07:38.490
     - If you're so scared,
           (mumbles).

07:38.492 --> 07:39.391
         - Disgusting.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.829
   - [Terry] That's Crystal,

07:43.831 --> 07:45.931
        she's the direct
      opposite of Amanda.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.065
    - What the fuck, Jaguar,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.934
      how many times do I
       have to tell you?

07:48.936 --> 07:52.404
   Put it out, seriously, you
 smell like a fucking ashtray!

07:52.406 --> 07:54.206
      That's why you can't
    make any fucking money.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.575
    - God damn, bitch, where
   you want me to smoke out?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.910
  - I mean, damn it, how many
   times do I gotta tell you?

07:58.912 --> 08:02.414
 Go outside or something, shit.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.982
 Sweetie, you're on stage next.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.853
     - Jojo runs the club.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.120
     Drug dealer made good.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.523
      Gotta respect anyone
        that can turn to

08:11.525 --> 08:13.892
        their house from
        illegal to legal

08:13.894 --> 08:16.561
     and still check a cool
 profit at the end of the day.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.099
     (deep rhythmic music)

08:21.101 --> 08:22.133
       - Why don't you go
        get me a drink?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.902
 - Yeah, I ain't get no drink.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.937
      (mumbles) some tits
         and some ass.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.973
           (laughing)

08:27.975 --> 08:29.374
    Hey, remember that shit
      when you were kids,

08:29.376 --> 08:33.010
  put a quarter in a machine,
that's the same shit right here.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.347
           (laughing)

08:37.484 --> 08:39.017
 - But somethings never change.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.051
        Easy baby, easy.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.154
   Better start locking doors
          around here.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.724
  - I don't gotta lock doors,
     I'm quick on the draw.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.427
       I heard about your
    cook's little accident.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.796
  - More like a big accident.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.099
  Blew himself and his girl to
           holy hell.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.701
    - What are you gonna do
   about your product though?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.302
   I know you gotta get back
     on your feet somehow.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.803
  - I think I got it handled.

08:58.805 --> 09:02.040
     (deep rhythmic music)

09:09.516 --> 09:12.183
      - No, do not smoke a
     cigarette in this car.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.252
    - [Mike] It's a fucking
          convertible.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.820
- I don't want that in this car
            with me!

09:15.822 --> 09:17.355
        I don't want the
       secondhand smoke.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.557
          - Wow, man.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.092
  What kind of fucking web has
   she got spun on you, dog?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.928
        - Come on, man,
       help me out here.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.063
   - You don't have a fucking
   clue about relationships,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.798
            do you?

09:26.799 --> 09:28.532
      - No, I really can't
   relate to the fucking web

09:28.535 --> 09:32.437
  you've got spun around him.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.172
     - Terry, where are we
    dropping this fool off?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.374
    - Dropping me off, shit,
         man, come on.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.715
- Mike and I have to make a run.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.683
     I gotta drop you off.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.085
            - What?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.822
  It is after 2:00 am, Terry!

09:51.725 --> 09:54.359
     I thought we agreed on
       a fucking curfew!

09:54.361 --> 09:56.995
    - Oh, this bitch got you
          on a curfew?

09:56.997 --> 10:00.398
  - It's business, I need this
           right now.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.668
- This is how it starts, you're
  out all hours of the night,

10:03.670 --> 10:05.737
   then you're cooking again,
    then you're using again,

10:05.739 --> 10:07.305
  then you're in prison again.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.742
     - Wow, man, you really
  scored big with this chick.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.511
    She's a fucking psychic,
  she sees the fucking future.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.213
   - Shut the fuck up, Mike.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.148
      - I'm not doing this
        again with you.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.451
         I'm not doing
      another prison run.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.787
   I swear to god, Terry, if
    you go again, I'm gone.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.757
- You don't make enough money at
           the club.

10:28.328 --> 10:33.398
   Wanna be in school, bills
     and other shit's due.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.369
   Either I do this or we're
        out on our ass.

10:37.371 --> 10:40.939
   (exciting rhythmic music)

10:46.113 --> 10:50.482
   Fitz, Armenian mafia, one
     of LA's most eccentric

10:50.484 --> 10:53.385
     drug lords and nothing
          to toy with.

10:53.387 --> 10:56.321
- Look at that, fantastic, huh?

10:57.624 --> 10:58.590
       Fucking (mumbles).

11:04.831 --> 11:09.634
    Terry, I see you finally
    made it to the big city.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.936
      - It's a nice little
         drive for us.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.722
         It's my man--

11:13.723 --> 11:15.507
- I know who Mike is, your right
           hand man.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.444
   I know everything because
      I watch everything.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.580
      I don't want people
    think I'm not watching.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.585
 Do you know what part of town
          you are in?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.555
         It's what they
      call it in Armenia.

11:31.558 --> 11:35.326
 It's as close as I can get to
 home without taking airplane.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.495
      - Must be nice, dog.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.298
          - I love it.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.767
I love it because they love me.

11:44.104 --> 11:48.940
 I'm king here, they appreciate
    what I do for my people.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.043
 But I love where you live too.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.181
   - [Terry] That's Mia, his
           bodyguard,

11:56.183 --> 11:58.683
   one of the most beautiful
      psychopathic killers

11:58.685 --> 11:59.751
        you'll ever see.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.721
       - There's a lot of
        space out there.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.557
      You can do whatever
    you want, no one cares.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.660
     - [Terry] She does not
     talk, she just kills.

12:08.662 --> 12:12.997
  - So what can I do for you,
             Terry?

12:12.999 --> 12:17.068
   - I just need some weight
   so I can start wholesaling

12:17.070 --> 12:19.170
   and stop chasing pennies.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.773
    - There's a lot of dope
   on the streets out there.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.275
  What makes you think you can
          move weight?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.845
    - It's my hometown, I've
     made a name for myself

12:26.847 --> 12:28.480
moving weight a few years back.

12:28.482 --> 12:29.614
      - What about muscle?

12:31.651 --> 12:34.586
    South side has got a lot
   of labs set up out there.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.188
      They shake you down
         just for sport

12:37.190 --> 12:40.458
   and I don't think your dog
   here has big enough bite.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.261
  - I got plenty of dogs, dog.

12:44.498 --> 12:48.266
   - Okay, but I assume that
     you know with me that

12:49.636 --> 12:54.105
    you owe whether you move
   it, lose it, or whatever.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.173
       - You know I know.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.410
   - I hope you know, Terry.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.450
      One question, I know
    you are best cook ever.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.753
   Why not just work in lab?

13:10.190 --> 13:12.123
      - Mmm hmm, I'm never
     getting out of prison

13:12.125 --> 13:14.259
     if I'm caught anywhere
          near a lab.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.493
    - To making a (mumbles).

13:16.596 --> 13:18.663
 - (mumbles) should be American
           made, man.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.633
     It's the fucking super
    sport of the dope game.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.067
        I love America.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.970
       (soft rock music)

13:30.644 --> 13:34.679
I'm just saying, man, shit just
           got real.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.048
  I'm (mumbles) that's Armenia
          mafia, dog.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.951
  - This ain't the time to get
           cold feet.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.190
  - No man, all I'm saying is
   you cooking and you slip,

13:45.192 --> 13:47.058
  it's a long time in the pen.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.562
     You slip with Fitz and
   you're in the grave, dog.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.664
   It's all a fucking gamble.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.965
   - That means no slipping.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.768
 It's like clockwork, stick to
          the program,

13:56.770 --> 13:58.036
    watch each other's back.

13:58.905 --> 14:01.172
  - T, you're all I got, man.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.741
 I ain't got no fucking family.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.310
  You're the only motherfucker
     that reached out to me

14:05.312 --> 14:07.178
   when I came down from AZ.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.046
    I've had your back, dog.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.347
  What's the fucking program?

14:09.349 --> 14:12.917
 - Simple, we got five pounds.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.285
        Dump half pounds
        to eight people,

14:14.287 --> 14:16.688
    spread the weight so the
     vultures don't see us.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.193
  - What if we get half back?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.195
      Or worse, what if we
      get nothing at all?

14:24.197 --> 14:26.397
   - Worst comes to worst, we
  can grind up the last pound

14:26.399 --> 14:28.066
       dollar for dollar.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.702
      We got Bobby in the
     dog pound backing us.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.737
       It's a cake walk.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.472
    Stick with the program.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.640
          (gun cocks)

14:35.642 --> 14:39.210
   (soft lighthearted music)

14:53.460 --> 14:58.162
     Well, we up now, just
    got the drop from Fitz.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.333
      (exciting fun music)

15:13.647 --> 15:16.014
    - Oh my god, it's 7:15,
     I have to go to class!

15:18.685 --> 15:22.020
 - Can I get a little affection
   after a hard night's work?

15:22.022 --> 15:24.722
    - Maybe if you actually
      came home at night,

15:24.724 --> 15:26.758
      you'd get more than
      a little affection.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.996
           (laughing)

15:31.998 --> 15:35.566
   (soft lighthearted music)

15:55.155 --> 15:56.721
       I want you so bad.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.926
But I need an education and you
           can wait.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.531
    - Such a fucking tease.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.668
   - One more year of school
   and then I'll be certified

16:10.670 --> 16:13.204
     to work in a hospital
   and I'll have a real job,

16:13.206 --> 16:14.639
    we can have a real life.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.309
  Even move out of this stupid
          dying town.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.013
      - I got a real job,
       I make real money.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.614
That's what matters, the money.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.689
  I don't know what's so real
    about our relationship.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.125
       Take penitentiary
       chances everyday,

16:34.127 --> 16:35.493
   that's real enough for me.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.431
     - Terry, where did you
     get all of that dope?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.000
   Please tell me you're not
         cooking again.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.669
        - Of course not.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.903
       - Just be careful.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.675
  You know I didn't mean what
   I said last night, right?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.143
  - You said a lot last night.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.047
  - The part about leaving you
  if you went back to prison.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.183
      I'm not leaving you
        no matter what.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.920
     - And I'm not going to
     prison no matter what.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.490
       - Just be patient.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.393
You're smarter than all of this.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.133
 You can break down and rebuild
           an engine

17:15.135 --> 17:17.234
faster than you can cook a batch
            of dope.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.439
     - Why do you think my
  kitchen doubles as a garage.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.241
        I'm gonna get an
       auto shop one day.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.108
 - I know, Terry's Auto Repair.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.748
    I believe in you, baby.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.252
    - Do you want me to give
          you a ride?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.220
 - No, my classmate's coming to
            get me.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.924
     - [Terry] When you're
   sitting on this much dope,

17:39.926 --> 17:42.593
 the one thing you can't do is
           sit on it.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.731
        And to move it,
     you need muscle first.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.966
  My boy, Bobby, he breeds pit
           bulls and

17:48.968 --> 17:51.636
     rolls with some of the
     meanest dogs in town.

17:51.638 --> 17:56.707
     (deep rhythmic music)
           (barking)

18:02.949 --> 18:04.449
  - [Mike] So wait, what kinds
 of breeds you got here, bruh?

18:04.451 --> 18:06.184
       - I got all kinds,
        I got Americans,

18:06.186 --> 18:08.686
    I got Stafford Shires, I
    got red nose, blue nose,

18:08.688 --> 18:09.720
        I got brindles.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.189
Shit, I even do special orders,
              dog.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.023
    Why, you want something?

18:12.025 --> 18:12.924
        - No, I'm good.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.695
     - Ya'll came down here
     to talk about canines?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.397
    What ya'll really want,
        what's popping?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.850
   - [Terry] We need muscle.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.901
      We got weight and we
   want you to roll with us.

18:28.141 --> 18:31.242
- Told you before, dog, you know
           how I do.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.511
     I don't touch nothing
  unless it's some real weight

18:33.513 --> 18:35.012
      and some real paper.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.915
  In case ya'll ain't notice,
    there's dope everywhere,

18:37.917 --> 18:39.550
         every corner.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.052
        - We got weight.

18:41.054 --> 18:43.721
    With you and your boys,
    the dog pound behind us,

18:43.723 --> 18:48.526
    nobody in these streets
        want a problem.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.795
- [Bobby] How much weight ya'll
           got, dog?

18:51.831 --> 18:54.382
         - Five pounds.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.934
     - Damn, ya'll sitting
    on five pounds of dope?

18:56.936 --> 18:59.337
      - Hell yeah, man, we
   ain't fucking around, dog.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.241
     - [Bobby] Damn, where
  ya'll trying to move it at?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.376
      - Everywhere, right.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.544
       But first we gotta
         lock down that

19:06.546 --> 19:07.945
  fucking bullshit pool hall.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.816
    - All right, I hear you.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.151
         What's my cut?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.553
- Whatever you want, reasonable.

19:15.555 --> 19:16.821
         - Yeah, yeah.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.356
          (whistling)

19:18.358 --> 19:21.759
     Fiss, Fiss, come here,
     come here, come here.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.331
  Yeah, so what ya'll planning
     to do about the ese's?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.800
     - Shit, that's what we
          got you for.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.769
- I say we cut them in, be fair.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.740
     If they don't want in,
  fuck them, we cut them out.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.607
          - Like that?

19:36.609 --> 19:37.575
          - Like that.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.960
         - Word, homie.

19:38.961 --> 19:40.344
  Yo man, we need to lock this
         shit down and

19:40.346 --> 19:42.480
they'll fucking come to us, man.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.048
   - What, what, what's that?
         (dog squeals)

19:44.050 --> 19:48.452
   Oh, I forgot, where ya'll
   get all this weight from?

19:48.454 --> 19:50.054
            - Fitz.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.557
- Fitz gave you all five pounds?

19:54.093 --> 19:54.992
             What?

19:56.062 --> 19:57.595
 This is real, you understand.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.363
- That's why the fuck we came to
           you, dog.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.499
      - That's why I love
    ya'll like my dogs, huh,

20:01.501 --> 20:02.967
    that's why I love ya'll!

20:02.969 --> 20:05.469
 Let's get this money, we rich.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.774
      Pick it up tomorrow,
         huh, next day?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.777
         - Word, homie.

20:12.778 --> 20:14.912
    - Don't do none of that,
 don't mess with none of that.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.215
   - [Terry] This is Southern
    Cali and don't no drugs

20:17.217 --> 20:19.016
  move around here without the
          south siders

20:19.018 --> 20:20.685
 getting a piece of the action.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.854
   That's the biggest Mexican
      gang in the country,

20:23.856 --> 20:25.890
  backed by the Mexican mafia.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.126
   Anytime the word mafia is
   put behind a nationality,

20:29.128 --> 20:31.229
 that simply means it goes all
 the way back to the homeland.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.447
- Shh, fuck, man, here he comes.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.664
      - [Terry] They come
    after your entire family

20:33.666 --> 20:34.999
       if you cross them.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.068
 It's not just about the money
           with them,

20:37.070 --> 20:39.070
they do it for the brown pride.

20:39.072 --> 20:44.141
     (deep rhythmic music)
           (grunting)

20:49.215 --> 20:50.781
       (speaking Spanish)

20:56.222 --> 21:00.458
      Welcome to (speaking
          in Spanish).

21:01.327 --> 21:03.794
 You're one of us now, holmes.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.164
  You're gonna need this ese.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.335
     (deep rhythmic music)

21:15.275 --> 21:18.509
     (speaking in Spanish)

21:19.912 --> 21:21.679
    - Shit ese, I thought we
    were gonna have to leave

21:21.681 --> 21:24.215
    your ass here, come back
   and try again another day.

21:24.217 --> 21:25.816
      (mumbles) had to do
        that five times,

21:25.818 --> 21:28.686
 (mumbles) with an ass kicking,
             homie.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.588
  - Not me, homie, I'm all in.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.656
        - Is that right?

21:31.658 --> 21:32.657
        - That's right.

21:32.658 --> 21:33.657
- You ready to buck your cherry,
             homie?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.493
     Put in some real work?

21:35.495 --> 21:39.196
   - For sure, let's do this.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.198
       (speaking Spanish)

21:41.200 --> 21:43.367
  - Welcome to the hood, ese.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.002
         - Scream, ese.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.772
    Fucking scream, holmes.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.609
 - (mumbles) we did scream last
  time (speaking in Spanish).

21:51.611 --> 21:54.945
     We gotta switch it up,
      it's (mumbles) time.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.382
   - Come on, ese, scream is
   (mumbles) as fuck, homie.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.084
           (mumbles)

22:00.086 --> 22:02.920
     - Nah, fuck that, man,
     everybody do the same.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.956
 What you wanna stand out for,
              ese?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.758
 Why, so you can be identified,
             homie?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.593
What the fuck is wrong with you
           guys, man?

22:09.595 --> 22:10.961
   This ain't a fucking game!

22:13.366 --> 22:15.433
    You motherfuckers better
    get this shit straight,

22:15.435 --> 22:16.634
    I fucking swear, homie.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.104
  This ain't no fucking game,
             homie!

22:20.106 --> 22:21.138
This ain't no fucking game, ese.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.873
   This is some serious shit,
             homie.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.943
         You got that?

22:25.945 --> 22:27.078
           Hey Flea?

22:27.080 --> 22:28.446
       - What's up, dog?

22:28.447 --> 22:29.813
 - You know what you gotta do,
             right?

22:29.816 --> 22:31.182
           (mumbles)

22:31.184 --> 22:32.450
   - This vato will be fine.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.552
 It's like riding a bike, Flea.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.788
     After the first time,
     it's a breeze, homie.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.966
     - Don't fucking move,
         motherfucker!

22:48.968 --> 22:51.936
       (soft eerie music)

22:57.744 --> 23:02.012
  - Let's get the fuck out of
   here, let's go, let's go!

23:02.014 --> 23:07.084
        (deep thumping)
       (soft eerie music)

23:18.164 --> 23:21.232
       (glass shattering)
          (gun firing)

23:25.471 --> 23:28.339
       (tires squealing)

23:46.626 --> 23:47.725
         - Damn, Paco.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.227
   - Shut the fuck up, bitch.

23:50.229 --> 23:53.230
    You see men are talking,
          stupid fuck.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.865
 Check it out, homie, we're in
          the city and

23:54.867 --> 23:56.700
   we're taking care of some
         business, ese.

23:56.702 --> 23:59.236
       - And we cut this
        little fool in.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.205
     Flea is (mumbles) now.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.574
  We dust him up a little bit.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.975
        - Is that right?

24:05.845 --> 24:07.244
        Get out of here.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.782
        Let me know when
       he's really ready.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.286
    Bring him back and I'll
      put some ink on him.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.054
      - See this tat, ese?

24:17.056 --> 24:21.025
   It's live, homie, ain't no
         turning back.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.260
   Let it die with them, ese.

24:25.331 --> 24:27.498
- Why your boy tripping, Flocko?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.000
 - Hey Flocko, come here, dog.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.437
      - Gotta take care of
   some business real quick.

24:33.439 --> 24:37.608
    You know, party with the
    homeboys, it's all good.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.079
    - That's right, let's go
   in the bedroom and party,

24:42.081 --> 24:43.514
         get fucked up.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.816
           (laughing)

24:51.357 --> 24:54.024
  - Hey man, so how's that lab
  doing, homie, that new lab?

24:54.026 --> 24:54.992
    - It's cool, real cool.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.194
We're pushing twice the volume.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.597
The shit's twice as strong, dog.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.764
    - Twice as strong, huh?

25:00.766 --> 25:03.400
     So we're making twice
    the profit then, right?

25:03.402 --> 25:04.702
 - Nah, (speaking in Spanish).

25:04.704 --> 25:06.220
      It got quiet, homie.

25:06.221 --> 25:07.737
   - But you just said you're
    making twice the volume,

25:07.740 --> 25:10.174
     so we should be making
    twice the profit, right?

25:11.210 --> 25:12.042
         - I know but--

25:12.044 --> 25:13.477
- What the fuck is the problem?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.847
- I don't know what to tell you,
              man.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.522
   - Wait in the back, take a
          break, okay.

25:24.524 --> 25:25.523
         Have some fun.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.792
 - So let me get this straight,
            Flocko,

25:28.794 --> 25:32.663
   if the production is A one
   and the product is A one,

25:32.665 --> 25:36.033
   then why the fuck ain't we
   killing it out here, ese?

25:36.035 --> 25:37.701
   - Because there's just too
    much dope out here, ese.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.303
      Everybody got shit!

25:39.305 --> 25:42.373
   - Sounds to me like we got
 some marketing problems, ese.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.975
 - (speaking in Spanish) ain't
   what it used to be, Vatos.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.311
     - Since when, you just
    said everybody got dope.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.812
  So it's cracking like that.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.448
     - Location, just like
          real estate,

25:51.450 --> 25:53.117
    it's all about location.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.818
 - That's why everybody in the
           hood kills

25:54.820 --> 25:56.687
     over territory, homie.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.255
 What's up with that pool hall?

25:59.225 --> 26:01.325
  - The owner wants more money
   than we making there, man.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.294
      That's why I backed
         off that shit.

26:03.296 --> 26:04.495
  - But more dope runs through
           there than

26:04.497 --> 26:06.096
 the whole fucking desert, ese.

26:06.098 --> 26:09.400
   - Shit, if we have to blow
     it up to lock it down.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.602
   It ain't worth it, vatos.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.004
    - Sounds to me like the
   problem is that you don't

26:14.006 --> 26:16.073
 really wanna put in work, ese.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.841
   Is that what I'm hearing?

26:17.843 --> 26:21.579
   - Hey little Sleepy, Flea,
  get the fuck out here, ese!

26:22.348 --> 26:25.316
       (deep tense music)

26:26.152 --> 26:28.018
  We're having a problem here,
              man.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.753
   Let me ask you something,

26:29.755 --> 26:32.189
   are you some motherfucking
        gangsters, huh?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.893
   Are you some motherfucking
          gangsters or

26:35.895 --> 26:37.161
       some punk bitches?

26:38.230 --> 26:40.097
  Because if you're gangsters,

26:40.098 --> 26:41.965
   you need to do shit like a
  motherfucking gangster, ese!

26:43.736 --> 26:45.469
  Gangsters don't fucking ask,

26:45.471 --> 26:48.105
   they don't ask permission,
  homie, they just take shit.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.507
They do what the fuck they want,
              ese!

26:50.509 --> 26:53.010
     - I don't have to move
         shit out here.

26:53.012 --> 26:56.680
   I got all my shit running
    my labs going all to LA.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.882
This is your fucking territory,

26:58.884 --> 27:00.618
    your fucking body, ese!

27:00.620 --> 27:02.753
What the fuck you really doing?

27:02.755 --> 27:05.756
    If anything, I got some
 fucking boxes full of oranges,

27:05.758 --> 27:07.491
       you guys can go to
       the freeway exits.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.226
I heard they making good money.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.494
          - Fuck that!

27:10.496 --> 27:14.431
 We gangsters, we take all this
  shit over before it happens

27:14.433 --> 27:15.866
         and (mumbles).

27:15.868 --> 27:19.269
      - You gangster, then
     start acting like one.

27:19.271 --> 27:22.239
       (deep tense music)

27:31.851 --> 27:34.818
       (slow eerie music)

27:48.434 --> 27:50.000
          (gun cocks)

27:50.736 --> 27:53.537
        (exciting music)

28:00.179 --> 28:05.249
     - Go, go, go, go, go!

28:06.719 --> 28:09.620
       (soft dark music)

28:18.531 --> 28:20.764
           (yelling)

28:21.967 --> 28:23.367
          (gun cocks)

28:23.769 --> 28:25.069
      - We're looking for
         the big dope.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.303
         Where it's at?

28:26.305 --> 28:27.604
     Who got it, what's up?

28:28.407 --> 28:29.306
           What's up?

28:30.342 --> 28:31.709
     What the fuck is this?

28:31.711 --> 28:33.444
I ever catch you in here again,

28:33.446 --> 28:35.279
     you're going to jail,
         you got that?

28:36.082 --> 28:37.848
         You got that?

28:37.850 --> 28:39.416
   Get the fuck out of here,
   get the fuck out of here!

28:40.286 --> 28:41.452
    Everybody, get the fuck
          out of here!

28:44.757 --> 28:45.823
           - What up?

28:45.825 --> 28:47.624
      Got you some coffee.

28:47.626 --> 28:48.525
           - Perfect.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.597
  - Everything's looking good.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.649
   We're going to be alright.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.700
  - Yeah man, I'm liking what
  I'm seeing right now, shit.
   You know what I'm saying?

28:59.004 --> 29:00.204
      - Freeze, hands up!

29:00.206 --> 29:03.107
       (deep dark music)

29:12.651 --> 29:14.818
       - [Terry] Ah, man.
    - [Mike] Ah, shit, man.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.954
     - I just love playing
       cops and robbers.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.325
    Especially when I'm the
   cop doing all the robbing.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.694
   Ya'll was scared as shit.

29:24.964 --> 29:27.531
  - Where the hell did you get
   all this shit from, dude?

29:27.533 --> 29:28.565
     - Hollywood Prop, yo.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.867
   Eh, man, that's my badge!

29:31.237 --> 29:34.638
   I'm like the movies, I was
  like, like DeNiro in there.

29:34.640 --> 29:35.739
     You should've seen me!

29:35.740 --> 29:36.839
      - Did they even ask
         you about it?

29:36.842 --> 29:38.108
           - Hell no.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.375
   Listen, them motherfuckers
    wanna get out of there.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.078
       They didn't wanna
       go to jail today.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.280
   Would you read this badge
   if we came in there like,

29:43.282 --> 29:44.932
          yo, get up!

29:44.933 --> 29:46.583
     You know what I mean,
      get up out of here!

29:46.585 --> 29:48.519
           (laughing)

29:48.521 --> 29:50.254
     Yo, ya'll better check
     ya'll panties because

29:50.256 --> 29:51.655
I know you shitted on yourself.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.056
           (laughing)

29:53.058 --> 29:55.526
   - Shit, homies, let's get
   to fucking work then, man.

29:55.528 --> 29:56.360
          - Let's go!

29:56.362 --> 29:58.395
 Yo, ya'll can relax now, man.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.464
    Damn, what's wrong with
      them, they serious.

41:10.735 --> 41:11.935
   - Because I wasn't scared,
           I knew it.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.606
You took long enough, damn, dog.

41:16.608 --> 41:19.042
    Yeah, man, yo these are
    my partners right here,

41:19.845 --> 41:20.677
        Mike and Terry.

41:20.679 --> 41:21.845
      - What's up, homie?

41:21.846 --> 41:23.012
  - This my brother, Diamond,
            a pimp.

41:23.014 --> 41:26.049
  That thing we talked about,
   I got that weight for you.

41:26.051 --> 41:29.486
    I just wanna know if you
     can move it out here.

41:29.488 --> 41:30.620
   - You know I control this.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.722
 Who got the key to this city,
          little bro?

41:32.724 --> 41:33.623
           - You do.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.093
        Keep it moving.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.695
   - Look around you, player.

41:38.697 --> 41:42.198
   Everything around here is
 like a big orchestra, player.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.366
     And I'm the conductor,

41:44.302 --> 41:46.503
     and they play whatever
      I tell them to play.

41:46.505 --> 41:50.640
  And I kick back, man, and we
 make beautiful music together.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.242
   - What about speed, dude?

41:53.278 --> 41:54.110
  It's really not your thing,

41:54.112 --> 41:55.311
you think you could move glass?

41:55.313 --> 41:56.946
    - Coke, weed, and speed,
         whatever man.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.583
     It ain't nothing, what
     are you talking about?

42:00.585 --> 42:04.053
      - Dog, what are you
         talking about?

42:04.055 --> 42:07.056
    - Eh, man, I think your
   players may be Federales.

42:07.058 --> 42:07.957
   Do you know these players?

42:07.958 --> 42:08.857
 - Hey, what the fuck you just
          say, homie?

42:08.860 --> 42:10.093
           - Yo, my--

42:10.095 --> 42:10.994
  - [Mike] No fuck that, dog,
    I don't play that shit.

42:10.996 --> 42:11.828
       - Yo, chill, Mike.

42:11.830 --> 42:12.662
      - Fucking cops here.

42:12.664 --> 42:13.763
  - Motherfucker, you know me,

42:13.765 --> 42:16.199
   you know I wouldn't bring
        you no bullshit.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.334
   - Man, I ain't ever gonna
      risk my big time hay

42:18.336 --> 42:19.936
 for this small time play, bro.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.571
        - Come on, dog!

42:21.573 --> 42:23.172
           - Player.

42:23.174 --> 42:24.073
             - Dog.

42:24.976 --> 42:25.875
           - Player.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.046
   - Look, play in this, dog.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.414
   You want the work or what?

42:34.252 --> 42:37.186
  - Man, I told you, bro, you
  drop it off, I knock it off.

42:37.188 --> 42:38.254
        I got you, man.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.822
 - Why didn't you say that when
           you first

42:39.824 --> 42:41.291
      got in the car, dog?

42:41.293 --> 42:44.193
       (light rap music)

42:47.766 --> 42:49.499
 - Yeah, what ya'll two need in
           ya'll life

42:49.501 --> 42:52.602
     is a little seasoning,
     player, a little snow.

42:52.604 --> 42:55.939
     And I keep it snowing
        365 days a year.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.111
           (mumbles)

43:02.113 --> 43:05.014
       (soft slow music)

43:23.201 --> 43:27.270
    (door opens and closes)

43:30.208 --> 43:31.207
       - Baby, I'm sorry.

43:32.177 --> 43:33.643
    Are you ready for work?

43:33.645 --> 43:35.912
      - It's all right, I
    took off anyway tonight.

43:37.215 --> 43:38.615
     - Damn, you should've
          let me know.

43:39.584 --> 43:41.184
    I would've rushed home.

43:41.186 --> 43:42.318
   You know I'm on a mission.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.253
      - All you care about
        is your mission.

43:45.557 --> 43:47.056
 - You know I gotta get rid of
          this stuff.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.425
    I can't just sit on it.

43:49.427 --> 43:52.128
  - Can't you see what this is
         doing to you?

43:52.130 --> 43:54.097
 - What are you talking about?

43:54.099 --> 43:56.232
  I'm getting us on our feet.

43:56.234 --> 43:58.167
      - We're on our feet.

43:58.169 --> 44:01.604
    We have a roof over our
  head and food on the table.

44:02.507 --> 44:04.874
 I watched greed destroy my mom
           and daddy.

44:04.876 --> 44:07.210
     - Don't compare us to
    your parent's failures.

44:10.782 --> 44:13.650
     - My dad is in prison
    for the rest of his life

44:13.652 --> 44:15.985
       because he killed
   somebody over drug money!

44:16.755 --> 44:17.954
       I see that in you!

44:17.956 --> 44:20.056
 - Don't throw that in my face.

44:20.058 --> 44:22.959
 Look, I took care of you with
           drug money

44:22.961 --> 44:24.394
    when your parents threw
     you out in the street

44:24.396 --> 44:25.795
  when you were 15 years old.

44:25.797 --> 44:27.997
      And I've been taking
    care of you ever since.

44:32.037 --> 44:34.203
  - Do you know why I took off
         work tonight?

44:37.108 --> 44:42.045
   I just wanted to be alone
           with you.

44:42.047 --> 44:44.947
       (soft slow music)

45:14.612 --> 45:16.846
           (moaning)

45:24.456 --> 45:27.423
       (soft tense music)

45:31.229 --> 45:32.395
   - And push the over unders
     on the small betters,

45:32.397 --> 45:33.563
          they add up.

45:33.565 --> 45:36.566
      My man, hot bets on
      rebounds and assists

45:36.568 --> 45:38.468
are for sure in the Boston game.

45:38.470 --> 45:40.870
    The point guard and the
    power forward are hurt.

45:40.872 --> 45:41.938
     That's a game changer.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.439
    - Props on block shots.

45:43.441 --> 45:45.575
    You got Andrews with 10,
        I don't see it.

45:45.577 --> 45:48.845
       - You never see it
       until it happens.

45:48.847 --> 45:53.249
  She sees it before which is
   why you work for her, duh.

45:54.953 --> 45:56.586
- New York's forward's hurt too.

45:56.588 --> 45:59.355
    So they're bringing Cole
  off the bench to play center

45:59.357 --> 46:01.524
        and push Andrews
       to power forward.

46:01.526 --> 46:03.392
That kid's jumping out the roof.

46:03.394 --> 46:07.196
     He'll block what, 12,
        15 shots easily.

46:07.198 --> 46:08.264
 - Well, my whales are in town,

46:08.266 --> 46:09.866
  I need something huge to put
            them on.

46:09.868 --> 46:11.200
   Can you give me something?

46:11.202 --> 46:13.436
     - For anyone trying to
        get rich quick,

46:13.438 --> 46:18.307
     my six pack parlay or
   accumulator or combo that
          is the one.

46:18.309 --> 46:20.643
      You tell them scared
   money don't make no money.

46:20.645 --> 46:21.811
     - I know that's right.

46:23.615 --> 46:25.982
     - I hear jets landing
          as we speak.

46:27.118 --> 46:30.253
    People I need you all to
   get out there and network.

46:30.255 --> 46:31.921
      I need new clients.

46:31.923 --> 46:35.792
    Use your VIP comps, pop
  bottles, get some hot girls.

46:35.794 --> 46:38.027
          Dazzle them.

46:38.029 --> 46:38.928
          Get to work.

46:41.666 --> 46:43.833
 It's gonna be a good weekend.

46:43.835 --> 46:46.135
           (beeping)

46:46.137 --> 46:47.937
- [Woman] Mr. Chang Lee in from
             China

46:47.939 --> 46:50.006
 has been waiting for an hour.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.574
 - We'll be there in a moment.

46:51.576 --> 46:53.576
           (beeping)

46:53.578 --> 46:55.444
     You ready, baby girl?

46:55.446 --> 46:58.714
    These China men like to
  intimidate to get their way.

46:58.716 --> 47:01.284
   - Yeah, but I'm in a whole
  different mood this morning.

47:01.286 --> 47:02.952
- Good, let's go get this money.

47:13.364 --> 47:15.598
 So sorry to keep you waiting,
            Mr. Lee.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.001
       (deep tense music)

47:19.003 --> 47:23.539
  - I seem to have come a bit
 ill prepared for this meeting.

47:23.541 --> 47:25.374
    I only brought my notes,

47:25.376 --> 47:27.243
   which consists of numbers
           and stats.

47:28.546 --> 47:30.880
 - Please forgive my assistant,
            Mr. Lee.

47:30.882 --> 47:33.216
    She just joined the NRA.

47:33.218 --> 47:36.118
 She's on a relentless campaign
           to express

47:36.120 --> 47:38.354
  her second amendment rights.

47:38.356 --> 47:41.324
  - Where I come from, we tend
   to lean towards education

47:41.326 --> 47:45.294
    and technology to uplift
     the people as a whole.

47:45.296 --> 47:46.796
             - Yes.

47:46.798 --> 47:49.765
       (deep tense music)

47:56.174 --> 47:59.675
 - I only have a few questions
      about our agreement.

47:59.677 --> 48:02.645
 I like your picks but since we
           are taking

48:02.647 --> 48:03.980
    all the financial risk--

48:03.982 --> 48:06.682
     - I totally understand
    and I want to assure you

48:06.684 --> 48:10.019
 that we will make adjustments
   for all of your concerns.

48:11.022 --> 48:14.023
       (slow tense music)

48:23.334 --> 48:24.333
           (laughing)

48:24.335 --> 48:26.002
Have you lost your fucking mind?

48:26.004 --> 48:26.903
            - What.

48:28.039 --> 48:30.406
    I was just trying to let
  them know from jump street,

48:30.408 --> 48:32.108
  we ain't with that bullshit.

48:32.110 --> 48:35.945
    - If you ever pull a gun
   within 3/10's of a second,

48:35.947 --> 48:37.747
      a bullet better come
       out that chamber.

48:37.749 --> 48:40.583
   - Hold on, wait, you mean
    to tell me you've never

48:40.585 --> 48:42.551
        pulled a gun to
      intimidate somebody?

48:42.854 --> 48:45.121
     - When you pull a gun,
      you shoot somebody.

48:45.123 --> 48:47.456
  You use this to intimidate.

48:47.458 --> 48:49.759
    You have got to learn to
     get the drop mentally,

48:49.761 --> 48:51.861
you pull a gun and you give them
           the power

48:51.863 --> 48:53.162
   because you didn't shoot!

48:54.599 --> 48:56.666
     - I was just trying to
     do what you would do.

49:00.071 --> 49:02.405
 - I sent you to school so that
           you didn't

49:02.407 --> 49:04.607
     have to do what I did.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.613
  Wake the fuck up, baby girl!

49:16.921 --> 49:18.788
        (exciting music)

49:18.790 --> 49:22.892
    ¶ Do you need it, do you
   need it, do you need it ¶

49:22.894 --> 49:27.530
   ¶ Why don't you mean it? ¶

  ¶ Man, they don't talk much,

    ¶ And move shit up like

    ¶ And death's the answer
    and the fact of cancer ¶

    ¶ We living in the hood,
     forever in the hood ¶

49:41.346 --> 49:43.679
   ¶ Bad bitches on the block
    forever give them love ¶

49:43.681 --> 49:47.049
   ¶ (Mumbles) the spots but
   they never give them up ¶

49:47.051 --> 49:49.018
  ¶ Man, they love dirty money
  so they don't give a fuck ¶

49:49.020 --> 49:51.887
 ¶ More dudes that get with it
 and live it until they buck ¶

49:51.889 --> 49:54.790
  ¶ But we gonna die young or
  have money and live it up ¶

49:54.792 --> 49:56.792
     ¶ Fuck it, give it up
        and get a job ¶

49:56.794 --> 49:59.795
 ¶ And turn neighborhood crack
    into star hitting hard ¶

49:59.797 --> 50:02.598
   ¶ You wanna pull bar, get
  large, you getting robbed ¶

50:02.600 --> 50:04.000
  ¶ Eye witnesses see it all ¶

50:04.002 --> 50:05.401

50:05.403 --> 50:08.304

50:08.306 --> 50:09.305

 ¶ Young thugs gun them down ¶

50:10.808 --> 50:13.409

50:13.411 --> 50:14.610
   ¶ I'm clapping for real ¶

50:14.612 --> 50:16.112

         ¶ (Mumbles) ¶

50:35.133 --> 50:37.700
     - What are you doing,
   I've been waiting for you?

50:37.702 --> 50:38.901
 - I was just waiting out here.

50:38.903 --> 50:40.269
  I don't wanna get bombarded.

50:40.271 --> 50:44.974
    - Yeah, you're becoming
   the man around here, huh?

50:44.976 --> 50:46.375
        Where's the car?

50:47.912 --> 50:49.945
 - I'm going to take it apart.

50:49.947 --> 50:52.815
     - What are you talking
  about, my car's in the shop.

50:52.817 --> 50:54.884
 - You wanna take your new car?

50:59.290 --> 51:01.257
         - You didn't.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.793
   No, we can't afford this.

51:03.795 --> 51:05.961
      - We all ready did.

51:05.963 --> 51:08.297
          Let's roll.

51:08.299 --> 51:10.666
           (laughing)
      (fun exciting music)

51:10.668 --> 51:15.438
  ¶ My love will never fade ¶

51:15.440 --> 51:19.241
 ¶ I promise I'm here to stay ¶

51:19.243 --> 51:20.910
        ¶ Here to stay ¶

51:20.912 --> 51:23.179
  ¶ Our love will never fade ¶

51:23.181 --> 51:26.449
  ¶ Never, never, never fade ¶

51:26.451 --> 51:29.318
 ¶ I promise I'm here to stay ¶

51:29.320 --> 51:32.088
        ¶ Here to stay ¶

51:32.090 --> 51:34.140
    ¶ When I first laid eyes
            on you ¶

51:34.141 --> 51:36.191
     ¶ I knew my heart was
          in trouble ¶

51:36.194 --> 51:38.527
     ¶ First sound of your
     voice made my blood ¶

51:38.529 --> 51:41.530
      ¶ Pumping and heart
         beat double ¶

51:41.532 --> 51:46.602
¶ Damn, it almost knocked me to
           my knees ¶

51:47.505 --> 51:51.574
    ¶ Then the look in your
  eyes told me you was on me ¶

51:51.576 --> 51:54.710
 ¶ So then I threw my sass on ¶

51:54.712 --> 51:56.262
      ¶ So you threw your
         mac because ¶

51:56.263 --> 51:57.813
     ¶ Somebody in action,
    ain't no turning back ¶

51:57.815 --> 52:01.250
      ¶ I swear to god you
    got my heart from now ¶

52:01.252 --> 52:05.387
    ¶ Until the day I die my
     love will never fade ¶

52:09.293 --> 52:14.363
      ¶ I promise I'm here
    to stay, here to stay ¶

52:14.665 --> 52:17.399
  ¶ My love will never fade ¶

52:17.401 --> 52:20.002
  ¶ Never, never, never fade ¶

52:20.004 --> 52:25.074
      ¶ I promise I'm here
    to stay, here to stay ¶

52:25.076 --> 52:26.809
      ¶ So you can wake up
    and you know that I'm ¶

52:26.811 --> 52:30.045
    ¶ Still gonna be there ¶

52:30.047 --> 52:35.117
 ¶ We can break up and you know
  that I'm still gonna care ¶

52:35.553 --> 52:38.621
    ¶ But a bitch better not
     play with your heart ¶

52:38.623 --> 52:41.524
       (deep dark music)

52:51.736 --> 52:53.502
       - Do you know why
        you wear gloves?

52:56.607 --> 52:59.141
   Why I make you wear stupid
         plastic hats?

53:01.112 --> 53:06.182
 DNA, DNA, which is like trail
            for dog.

53:07.618 --> 53:09.351
          Federal dog.

53:13.057 --> 53:14.857
I leave no trails to lead to me.

53:17.094 --> 53:22.164
So who brought cooking supplies
   from local supply company

53:22.533 --> 53:23.566
          into my lab?

53:26.771 --> 53:31.273
   Feds put tracking devices
    on all cooking supplies

53:31.275 --> 53:32.575
        sold in stores.

53:35.313 --> 53:36.979
     So I worry about DNA.

53:39.317 --> 53:41.817
     When they have fucking
       tracking devices!

53:43.955 --> 53:47.223
      Now four of my labs
        raided and gone.

53:48.059 --> 53:51.193
      (deep intense music)

53:53.397 --> 53:57.066
    You are so fucking hot.

53:57.068 --> 53:59.935
      Anyone stupid enough
    to lead a dog to my lab

53:59.937 --> 54:01.971
     will lead a dog to me.

54:13.718 --> 54:15.751
  - [Terry] Kelly was finally
     flying me out to Vegas

54:15.753 --> 54:17.519
    to see how she's living.

54:17.521 --> 54:19.855
  When you come up, it's only
         right that you

54:19.857 --> 54:21.190
 give a taste of the high life.

54:21.192 --> 54:24.293
And my girl, Kelly, she does it
           super big.

54:31.002 --> 54:34.136
      (fun rhythmic music)

55:06.337 --> 55:08.637
           (laughing)

55:10.908 --> 55:12.975
           (cheering)

55:12.977 --> 55:14.510
            - Yeah!

55:14.512 --> 55:18.981
   Oh my goodness, everybody
     gets a top, everyone!

55:18.983 --> 55:21.317
           (cheering)

55:28.359 --> 55:32.027
Stop the music, stop the music!

55:32.029 --> 55:35.764
   Whoo, what a night, what a
  night, what a night, ya'll!

55:35.766 --> 55:38.534
    I have to do a toast for
     everyone in this room

55:38.536 --> 55:41.770
 that put your money where your
           mouth is.

55:41.772 --> 55:46.141
    You all are responsible
    for making this a record

55:46.143 --> 55:48.644
       setting month for
        Platinum Books,

55:48.646 --> 55:52.214
and for that, we've got to toast
             it up.

55:52.216 --> 55:54.516
           (cheering)

55:56.253 --> 55:57.720
    - That's all you, baby,
         it's all you!

55:57.722 --> 55:58.954
           (laughing)

55:58.956 --> 56:01.623
       - Thank you, baby,
     but it's also because

56:01.625 --> 56:04.093
      I got a great team,
      my team is awesome.

56:04.095 --> 56:06.795
   Thank you guys for getting
     out there, networking,

56:06.797 --> 56:07.830
    making it do what it do.

56:07.832 --> 56:11.033
      But there's one very
    special lady that I got

56:11.035 --> 56:14.069
     to show some love to,
     she's my inspiration,

56:14.071 --> 56:19.141
  she's my backbone, she's my
 assistant, she's my baby girl.

56:19.143 --> 56:21.243
     Ya'll show some love,
    come on up here, Keisha,

56:21.245 --> 56:22.111
            come on!

56:22.113 --> 56:24.446
           (cheering)

56:28.586 --> 56:31.854
      - All right, we all
    know what this is about.

56:33.157 --> 56:38.227
   The testament to the fact
    that real numbers add up

56:38.929 --> 56:40.763
    to real accomplishments.

56:40.765 --> 56:41.764
             - Yes!

56:41.766 --> 56:42.998
        - Because what?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.701
  - [Group] Numbers don't lie!

56:45.703 --> 56:47.569
           (cheering)

56:51.041 --> 56:54.510
    (exciting playful music)

56:54.512 --> 56:55.611
 ¶ I'm a winner in this bitch ¶

56:55.613 --> 56:58.147
    ¶ You just been getting
         in the shit ¶

56:58.149 --> 56:59.381
        ¶ I can't lose ¶

56:59.383 --> 57:00.616
 ¶ I'm a winner in this bitch ¶

57:00.618 --> 57:02.418
    ¶ You just been getting
         in this shit ¶

57:02.420 --> 57:04.186
        ¶ I can't lose ¶

57:04.188 --> 57:06.722
¶ And I know you wanna hate us ¶

57:06.724 --> 57:09.057
    ¶ And that's okay too ¶

57:09.059 --> 57:11.860
       ¶ I be on hiatus ¶

57:11.862 --> 57:14.196
 ¶ Waiting for the next move ¶

57:14.198 --> 57:16.081
¶ I'll be on my super fly shit ¶

57:16.082 --> 57:17.965
 ¶ Blasted out of my mind with
   like two to five chicks ¶

57:17.968 --> 57:19.301
       ¶ That (mumbles) ¶

57:19.303 --> 57:21.003
      ¶ Yeah, I keep them
       in my repertoire ¶

57:21.005 --> 57:23.472
    ¶ Bad bitches with more
    gifts than Mardi Gras ¶

57:23.474 --> 57:25.274
    ¶ The money (mumbles) ¶

57:25.276 --> 57:27.042
   ¶ Rather go hungry because
     the money's on line ¶

57:27.044 --> 57:32.114
   ¶ Never look dumb because
      I own my (mumbles) ¶

57:32.283 --> 57:33.982
    ¶ Nigga, I ain't lyin' ¶

57:33.984 --> 57:36.151
        - Hey (mumbles)!

57:37.521 --> 57:39.822
           (laughing)

57:40.724 --> 57:43.625
     Hey, hey, pretty boy,
          how are you?

57:44.862 --> 57:45.761
           Wow, huh.

57:47.064 --> 57:48.530
      This is crazy, huh?

57:48.532 --> 57:52.234
   Well, you know us, we work
   hard, we play even harder.

57:52.236 --> 57:55.137
         - Look at you,
       you really did it.

57:55.139 --> 57:57.206
      I'm gonna do it just
          like you do.

57:57.208 --> 57:59.341
     - Oh, come on, you're
     a fine ass white boy.

57:59.343 --> 58:00.909
      The world loves you.

58:00.911 --> 58:03.912
     Me, I'm a black woman
   and they try to ignore me

58:03.914 --> 58:05.714
    but I wasn't having it.

58:05.716 --> 58:08.383
 You know, if I can do it, you
           can do it.

58:08.385 --> 58:10.652
 - How the hell did you make so
          much money?

58:10.654 --> 58:13.155
    - I took an old concept,
          made it new.

58:13.157 --> 58:14.923
     Sports betting is the
        new Wall Street.

58:14.925 --> 58:18.694
    It's safer, predictable,
      easy to manipulate.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.696
     - I never heard of the
    sports crashing either.

58:20.698 --> 58:22.464
        - Yeah, exactly.

58:22.466 --> 58:24.633
    People like to see their
      money work for them.

58:24.635 --> 58:25.834
       I make it happen.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.469
   I'm a new age stockbroker.

58:27.471 --> 58:29.638
    - Sounds like something
          I get into.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.139
    - Unless you get robbed,

58:31.141 --> 58:34.076
    and then I have to come
     in and regulate again.

58:34.078 --> 58:37.946
   - Picture how we left that
place stuck in my head forever.

58:37.948 --> 58:41.183
       (deep dark music)

58:41.185 --> 58:44.453
Kelly actually got her start in
            the game

58:44.455 --> 58:46.188
    as a hitman for the mob.

58:47.057 --> 58:49.925
       One time, I had a
        serious problem.

58:51.428 --> 58:56.331
    I called her up for help
   and whoa, problem solved.

58:56.333 --> 59:00.736
   - Ya'll just had to bring
      the bitch out in me.

59:00.738 --> 59:02.371
  Well get that picture out of
           your head

59:02.373 --> 59:03.939
         because things
       are different now.

59:03.941 --> 59:05.941
  I'm in the luxury business.

59:05.943 --> 59:08.310
       Everything that my
    clients want, from jets,

59:08.312 --> 59:13.415
   VIP at the clubs, suites,
   girls, whatever they want,

59:13.417 --> 59:14.983
  I deliver, I make it happen.

59:14.985 --> 59:17.152
     - That alone must cost
         you a fortune.

59:17.154 --> 59:19.421
      - No, I can get some
   good comps at the casino.

59:19.423 --> 59:20.255
         They love me.

59:20.257 --> 59:21.089
   - Shouldn't they hate you?

59:21.091 --> 59:21.990
       They hate to lose.

59:23.460 --> 59:25.427
      - They love winners.

59:25.429 --> 59:28.330
    You should see, they do
       articles, magazine
         spreads on it,

59:28.332 --> 59:30.365
    makes people think that
         they can win.

59:30.367 --> 59:31.199
- And that keeps them gambling.

59:31.201 --> 59:32.467
        - Yeah, exactly.

59:32.469 --> 59:35.437
  I get them into the casinos
    and once they got them,

59:35.439 --> 59:37.372
         they got them.

59:37.374 --> 59:38.206
         - That's big.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.174
            - Yeah.

59:39.176 --> 59:40.576
    What you doing nowadays?

59:40.578 --> 59:43.579
 - Trying to work on some cars,
  you know, have my own shop,

59:43.581 --> 59:45.080
         own some shit.

59:45.082 --> 59:47.449
   - Think bigger than that.

59:47.451 --> 59:48.784
  I tell you what, pretty boy,

59:48.786 --> 59:51.386
     you slide some of that
          cash my way

59:51.388 --> 59:55.190
      and I guarantee you,
         guarantee you,

59:55.192 --> 59:57.092
    you will have a block of
        your own shops.

59:57.094 --> 59:58.327
            Feel me?

59:58.329 --> 59:59.461
            - Yeah.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:00.629
      - I'm gonna make it
        happen for you.

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:02.664
     - You're looking good.

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:03.599
      - You looking good.

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:04.566
             - Hey!
      - Well, lookee here.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:05.767
        Hi, pretty girl.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:06.802
    - I'm proud of you, an.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:08.971
     (mumbles) look at you!

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.773
           (laughing)

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.574
   - It's nice when pieces of
   the puzzle come together.

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:15.243
       Picking up pieces,
    maybe you should get her

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.244
      a little piece too.

01:00:17.348 --> 01:00:19.047
 - You got that vision though.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:20.983
Your mind puts things together.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.584
      - Boom, boom, boom.

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:24.086
     - I'm blessed you keep
    me part of the picture.

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:25.621
          - I got you.

01:00:25.623 --> 01:00:28.590
 - Look at this picture, we got
 the whole crew back together.

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:30.225
  - Ah, group hug, group hug.

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:31.893
           (laughing)

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:32.794
              Ooh.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.632
Well, I think a billion dollars
    just walked in the door.

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:40.369
I'm gonna holla at ya'll later.

01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:41.436
          - Get that.

01:00:41.438 --> 01:00:44.473
      (fun dancing music)

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:50.612
           (cheering)

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:13.935
   - Sometimes staying sober
    around so much dope and

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:15.303
   money is the hardest part.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:19.675
  I think Biggie said it best,
    commandment number four,

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.777
 I know you heard this before,

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.545
       never get high on
        your own supply.

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:28.116
      While I was in Vegas
      tying ends together,

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:31.887
    Mike was at home coming
      apart at the seams.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:34.856
       (deep tense music)

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:56.111
       - What's going on?

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:58.413
    I told you I don't have
      to work until later.

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.048
     - Bitch, I am working.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.151
 - Well, you at least could've
           fucked me.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:04.553
 - What, you wanna get fucked?

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:10.625
  - You're a fucking asshole.

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:11.860
  - Consider yourself fucked,
             bitch.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:12.694
          - Fuck you.

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:13.528
        - No, fuck you!

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:14.629
          - Fuck you!

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.698
        - Stupid bitch.
           - Asshole.

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:28.243
        (fun rap music)

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:21.096
           (mumbles)

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.042
       (deep dark music)

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:36.711
  - Good morning, pretty boy.

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:38.713
        You're up early.

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:40.714
     - [Terry] Can't sleep,
   thinking about your offer.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.284
      Why you up so early?

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:44.987
   - To be ahead of the game,

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.689
   your game has got to start
   everyday before everybody
            else's.

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:49.224
          Simple math.

01:03:49.226 --> 01:03:51.593
    - [Terry] What do you do
   this time of the morning?

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:52.494
          - Research.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:55.764
  You see, the most important
    thing in sports betting

01:03:55.766 --> 01:03:58.633
     is knowing everything
   about a player or a team.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:01.603
  Who's hurt, who's on drugs,
     who's wife left them,

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:03.138
           whatever.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.307
  - [Terry] Because everything
  affects who's going to win.

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:07.142
           - Exactly.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:09.044
      By the time everyone
         else gets up,

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:10.512
 I've all ready done my picks.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:13.982
  See, they think I'm a genius
  but I just put in the work.

01:04:14.785 --> 01:04:16.585
      And pretty boy, you
    started your morning off

01:04:16.587 --> 01:04:18.019
      right this morning.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.020
           I got you.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.322
           (laughing)

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:22.107
     - [Terry] I'm all in.

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:23.891
    I'm going to drop it in
   the account like you said.

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:26.428
      - Cool, let me know
   after you go to the bank.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:27.262
      - [Terry] All right.

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.263
           - Toodles.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:31.900
              Hey!

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:32.734
           - Morning.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:34.202
    - [Kelly] Good morning.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:37.839
   (exciting energetic music)

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:45.680
          - What's up?

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:47.132
       - What's up, fool?

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.583
     - Look, it ain't even
       popping up in here

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:50.118
 unless you came to talk to me,
           all right.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.854
           (mumbles)

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:53.755
             What?

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:55.290
           (grunting)

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:56.524
         What's up now?

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:08.236
      Get the fuck out of
    here, get the fuck out!

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.240
   Your fucking ass is mine!

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:15.076
  Get the fuck up outta here!

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.178
What the fuck wrong with ya'll?

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.314
 Look at all the guns not used!

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:22.217
       (deep rock music)

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:37.999
  - Yo, what the hell is wrong
           with you?

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.267
       Have you lost your
       mind or something?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.535
 - What are you talking about?

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.504
   - You got dope from Fitz?

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:43.405
         And on credit?

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:46.641
   - Look, we got it handled,
           all right.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:48.009
     - Who the fuck are you
      to even speak on our

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.311
      business right now?

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:50.645
    - Clearly you don't know
           who I am,

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:52.147
      otherwise you'd keep
     your mouth shut, okay.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:53.048
      - Who is this bitch?

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.683
- Whoa, whoa, all right, chill.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:57.085
    Look, we got it fronted,
       we got it covered,

01:05:57.087 --> 01:05:58.286
it's handled, the money's there.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:00.855
       We're taking it to
         him right now.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:02.290
             - Bam.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.726
   - Bam, see all that shit.

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:05.961
We're fucking balling right now.

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:08.530
        Look, we're up.
           (screams)

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:10.532
     - (mumbles) you don't
    know what you're doing.

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.434
 - I will fucking slap the shit
          out of you.

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:13.268
             - Hey!

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.269
        - [Terry] Jojo.

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:15.103
            - What?

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.527
    - Chill, please put the
           gun down.

01:06:16.528 --> 01:06:17.950
    - Get your fucking head
   blown off your shoulders.

01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:19.373
   Listen, you know what game
        you're in, man,

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:20.959
    I'm just trying to say,

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.543
 don't be stupid and get pulled
    into the bullshit, okay.

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:23.378
           For real.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.780
- [Terry] You know I know that.

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:26.181
   - For real, and shake that
 tweaked out loser next to you.

01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:27.849
    - Bitch, fuck you, man.

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:30.051
     (mumbles) pull a guns
     out and not using it.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.336
    - No since shooting you,

01:06:31.337 --> 01:06:32.620
   you'd be a waste of a good
         bullet, babe.

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:34.990
    - Hey, take your fucking
      ass and walk it back

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:36.658
   to the fucking strip club,
             bitch.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.159
    - The only thing beating
     on you is your mouth.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.427
        Be safe, Terry.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.130
- What the fuck was that, dude?

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:43.932
     - Don't let that strip
      club shit fool you.

01:06:43.934 --> 01:06:44.866
 - Who the fuck is that bitch?

01:06:44.868 --> 01:06:46.568
  - She's a gunner, for real.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:50.138
   (slow lighthearted music)

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.264
    That's everything I owe
   you, and I'm a week early.

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:19.467
        - I'm impressed.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.770
   I have much faith in you.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.040
     Now I need your help.

01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:28.109
 - How can I possibly help you?

01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:30.945
   - I know you have a recipe
          through cork

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:32.781
  using our three ingredients.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:37.252
   It's impossible to set up
 new labs now because of feds.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:39.421
      I need you to cook.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:43.625
   - No way, absolutely not,
    I can't cross that line.

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:48.196
      - I respect that but
     you do owe me a favor.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:51.032
       One favor deserves
   another in turn, I think.

01:07:52.002 --> 01:07:53.668
  - Yeah, but that's my life.

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:54.803
     I don't owe you that.

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:00.075
            - Okay.

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:06.281
   So you will take one more
  package and move it for me.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:10.118
      We'll be even then,
       you will be rich.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.455
         Say 50 pounds.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:16.323
        - Fuck it, dog,
      we can do this shit.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:17.158
       - That's 10 times.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.693
     - I don't give a fuck.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.328
   - Oh, Terry, Terry, Terry.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:23.832
   You take your time, I know
    you have clientele now,

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:26.667
         so just roll.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.237
- Man, give me this fucking bag,
              dog.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.638
        I ain't playing.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:37.045
     - It's the last load,
         then I'm out.

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:40.881
  - Come on, dog, let's roll.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:44.919
       (deep tense music)

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.020
 - [Terry] So what's the count?

01:08:46.022 --> 01:08:48.723
      You always say every
    game is a numbers game.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:51.658
    - Accountability is the
     ability to count your

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:55.063
    strengths and weaknesses
    and asses them properly.

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.865
- [Terry] How do my assets look?

01:08:56.867 --> 01:09:00.033
       - Mmm, you have a
        retirement fund,

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:01.536
if that's what you trying to do.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.971
     - [Terry] That's all I
        needed to hear.

01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:07.809
  - Listen, I'm at my LA spot,
    you should come through,

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.444
   we're having some drinks.

01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:10.562
    - [Terry] I'll be there.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:11.679
 - All right, darling, I'll see
           you soon.

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:14.582
        I like that kid.

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:16.984
       - I'm so pissed at
        Terry right now.

01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:18.553
        - What happened?

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:19.821
      He sounded so cool.

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.089
  - Yeah, he thinks he's cool.

01:09:21.091 --> 01:09:24.024
He got dope from Fitz, how cool
            is that?

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:26.194
  - Well, in this game, if you
         wanna be big,

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:28.129
   you gotta make big moves.

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:29.863
 That includes taking big risk.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.767
      - Not trying to see
        him get played.

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.002
        He's playing way
       out of his league.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:37.839
    - You can't protect him
  from his bumps and bruises.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.108
    They'll either make him
         or break him.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.544
     You try to protect him
    from those life lessons,

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:45.180
      he will never become
          his own man.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:46.648
          Understand?

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:47.615
            - Yeah.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:52.120
- Because baby, this game ain't
            no joke.

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:53.421
       - Cheers to that.

01:10:06.136 --> 01:10:09.103
       (tense rock music)

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.824
           (snoring)

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:16.170
    - [Terry] Crystal had no
   idea the Mexican she just

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:18.840
 robbed is cartel and the uncle
          of the head

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:20.475
      of the South Siders.

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:23.845
   She just turned everything
    up a whole nother notch.

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.947
      - These vatos didn't
         have my back.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.982
      These two dumb asses
        forgot the guns.

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:29.317
        - It's my fault.

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:33.688
     Can't send boys to do
          a man's job.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:34.756
       - I tried, homie--

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:35.890
      - Shut the fuck up.

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:39.394
      I just got word from
         my uncle that

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:40.928
 some little bitch robbed him.

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:44.132
    You can't even regulate
      a fucking pool hall.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:46.901
     Now we got little hos
        taking from us.

01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:55.843
  I'm putting the word in LA.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:01.249
    You got 48 hours to take
       care of business.

01:12:01.251 --> 01:12:04.152
       (slow deep music)

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:12.960
          (gun firing)
          (screaming)

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:28.943
       - Drop it, bitch.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:30.778
 Where's that bitch ass Bobby?

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.980
 - He left, I swear he's gone.

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:35.216
    - Tell that motherfucker
      jokers came through.

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:38.019
    Nothing moves or blinks
      in this motherfucker

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:39.120
     until he talks to me.

01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:42.223
         You got that?

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.060
         - Yeah, okay.

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:48.296
           (barking)

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:57.138
          (gun fires)

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.078
          (gun fires)

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:08.783
          (gun fires)

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:09.617
            - Fuck.

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:13.654
       - Just calm down.

01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:22.230
    - Terry's not answering.

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:29.470
     - Relax, you know the
reception out here is horrible.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:30.638
           (knocking)

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.973
- Open the fucking door, bitch!

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:34.976
       (deep tense music)

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:41.349
       Fucking bullshit.

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:49.290
     - Fucking went out the
        fucking window.

01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:51.859
   Get my fucking back, ese.
           (mumbles)

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:54.762
       (deep dark music)

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:58.666
 - They almost killed us, okay!

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:01.035
       - They came to the
         fucking hotel.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:03.371
     - [Crystal] They came
        out of nowhere.

01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:04.539
   - It's gonna be all right,
           I promise.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:07.608
 - It's not gonna be all right,
           it's not.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.243
      We can't even leave
       the house because

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.545
      of your drug thing!

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:12.079
       - I can't do this.

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:13.114
        - Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.148
 - [Amanda] We can't even leave
           the house.

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.182
    - Quit fucking tripping,
           all right.

01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:16.083
    We got this, all right.

01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:17.251
- They came after my girl, man.

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:18.786
     - So let's fucking do
      something about it.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:19.854
 - Get Bobby on the phone now.

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.857
       (deep tense music)

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:28.329
           (sobbing)

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:30.565
           (yelling)

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:34.936
           - Come on.

01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:37.305
         Not my babies.

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:40.308
       (slow eerie music)

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:50.885
     - Since you love those
     fucking dogs so much,

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:51.853
       you can join them.

01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:55.756
          (gun firing)

01:14:57.427 --> 01:14:59.961
    - They're trying to kill
   my girl, pool hall's dead,

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:02.497
  Bobby's dead, you're fucking
          strung out.

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:03.948
     - Hey, fuck you, dog.

01:15:03.949 --> 01:15:05.398
     If we don't get Fitz's
    money back, we're dead.

01:15:05.401 --> 01:15:07.435
    - There's no way we can
     move all that weight.

01:15:07.437 --> 01:15:09.203
      My girl's life is on
         the line now.

01:15:11.908 --> 01:15:13.708
We gotta give him the dope back.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.443
 - Fitz doesn't want his dope,
              dog,

01:15:15.445 --> 01:15:17.445
  he wants his fucking money,
           all right.

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:27.438
         - [Fitz] Yeah?

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:30.156
   - We got big problems with
    the Mexicans (mumbles).

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:32.960
 We gotta bring the work back.

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:34.428
        - [Fitz] I'm an
       understanding man.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:39.500
You bring it all back right now.

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:45.907
    - He says bring it back,
           all of it.

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:49.610
         - Okay, dope.

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:52.580
       (deep scary music)

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:13.834
            - Fuck!

01:16:13.836 --> 01:16:17.071
     (deep rhythmic music)

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.335
          (screaming)

01:17:22.572 --> 01:17:24.405
    - Crystal, you know I'm
    not trying to leave this

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:25.573
     house for any reason.

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:29.310
  - Terry said it was handled.

01:17:31.414 --> 01:17:36.384
  Look, I mean, after you two
   did almost get me killed,

01:17:36.386 --> 01:17:38.185
  it's the least you could do.

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:40.354
  - You know that's not true.

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:41.889
      Don't do this to me.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:43.124
 - You know I need this money.

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:44.392
    I can't just sit around.

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:54.802
    - Oh, I'm thrilled to be
    your personal chauffeur.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:04.045
      - Got some for you.

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:06.447
- Easiest 100 bucks I ever made.

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:11.886
       (slow tense music)

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:31.839
          - Nice shoe.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.809
       (deep tense music)

01:19:18.488 --> 01:19:19.637
          - What's up?

01:19:19.638 --> 01:19:20.787
       - I am spun out if
   something happened to her.

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.623
  - What the fuck you talking
          about, man?

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.058
 Hey, calm your ass down, dog.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.127
      Maybe she need some
    space or some shit, man.

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:28.295
      - No way, no way she
         does not call.

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:30.498
   Not her style, not at all.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.700
   - You need to sit the fuck
  down and calm your ass out.

01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:34.535
  All right, man, she's gonna
         fucking call.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:36.137
    - Bro, I can't sit down.

01:19:36.139 --> 01:19:38.672
        (phone ringing)
     - [Mike] There you go.

01:19:38.674 --> 01:19:41.509
       (deep dark music)

01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:43.644
            - Hello?

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:46.747
             Baby?

01:19:46.749 --> 01:19:48.482
             Hello?

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:51.118
 Fitz, what the fuck, what the
  hell you doing with my girl?

01:19:53.089 --> 01:19:55.122
     Whatever the hell you
    need me to do, I got it.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.828
   How the fuck does he know
     we lost all the dope?

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.530
   - What the fuck you mean,
           (mumbles).

01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:04.298
   That motherfucker, homie,

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.233
that motherfucker ripped us off,
              dog.

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:13.841
- I wanna see Amanda right now.

01:20:13.843 --> 01:20:15.927
          - Shh, shh.

01:20:15.928 --> 01:20:18.012
Terry, you are so cute when you
           are angry.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:21.816
       But you are in no
   position to make demands.

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:26.020
    So shut up and listen or
  you'll never see her again.

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:29.290
      Now, I bet you both
         have weapons.

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:34.361
     So Terry, take his gun
   and yours and bring them.

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:38.532
       (deep tense music)

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:57.117
          (gun firing)

01:20:57.119 --> 01:20:58.953
      - You fucking, shit!

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:00.921
    What the fuck, man, why?

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:02.223
         What the fuck!

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:06.627
       (deep dark music)

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.001
     - He was fucking pig,
         federal agent.

01:21:15.071 --> 01:21:16.337
     You didn't even know.

01:21:17.406 --> 01:21:20.741
    - No way, the last three
    years, we ate together,

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:23.711
        smoked together,
       he was my friend.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:24.612
         - He was good.

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:27.681
He used you to get close to me.

01:21:29.785 --> 01:21:30.684
           - No way.

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:34.788
       - Well at least he
       finished his job.

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:36.156
      He got close to me.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.962
Now I have insurance, his body,

01:21:41.964 --> 01:21:43.631
 your prints on murder weapon.

01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:47.835
    - Feds knew a long time
   ago Fitz would eventually

01:21:47.837 --> 01:21:51.238
     have to turn to me, so
    they slid Mike onto me.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.707
     But the game took him
        out even before

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:54.942
Fitz put the bullet in his head.

01:21:54.944 --> 01:21:57.845
   The dope, money, bitches.

01:21:57.847 --> 01:21:59.914
      Shit is just like a
      double edged sword,

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:01.682
    it'll slice you in half.

01:22:01.684 --> 01:22:04.685
       (slow jazzy music)

01:22:11.861 --> 01:22:13.961
   - [Amanda] This is how it
            starts.

01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:17.364
    You're gonna (mumbles).

01:22:18.868 --> 01:22:22.436
  ¶ I don't need it anymore ¶

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:26.373
       (deep scary music)

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:29.043
       - So, how are you,
      pretty little girl?

01:22:31.047 --> 01:22:33.447
    - Don't talk to me, you
    Armenian piece of shit!

01:22:34.483 --> 01:22:37.284
 - Now, now, I'll take that as
          not so good.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:42.122
   But don't worry, I'm here
    to make you feel better.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:47.194
    No crystal meth, heroin.

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:51.231
        - What the fuck.
          Wait for it.
           (crying)

01:22:51.233 --> 01:22:52.066
             - No.

01:22:52.068 --> 01:22:56.270
          No, no, no!

01:22:56.272 --> 01:22:58.806
    No, please, don't do it!

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:02.810
          (screaming)

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:07.047
     (deep rhythmic music)

01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:40.247
           (tapping)
        (radio chatter)

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:46.353
 - You tell us what's going on.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.888
      We got a dead agent
      that's been assigned

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:49.123
    to you for three years.

01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:52.126
      - I don't even know
        where to start.

01:23:52.128 --> 01:23:54.995
        - Okay, we know
     everything all ready,

01:23:54.997 --> 01:23:56.764
    probably more than you.

01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:59.099
   - You are not our target,
            Fitz is.

01:23:59.101 --> 01:24:03.203
    Murder, kidnapping, drug
  manufacturing, you feel me?

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:05.139
- So why the hell are you here?

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:06.106
 Why don't you go find him and

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:08.242
        bring my fucking
        girlfriend back?

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:10.077
     - It's not that easy.

01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:11.712
      We need you because
    our link to him is dead

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:13.147
    and you're an eyewitness
         to the murder.

01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:15.249
- We need you to connect him to
           the drugs.

01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:17.251
       - Fuck the drugs,
     I want my woman back.

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.555
   I know ya'll, ya'll don't
     give a fuck about her.

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:23.590
  - We have no idea where he's
          holding her.

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:25.259
  We jump the gun, she's dead.

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:27.828
      - Ya'll handle ya'll
  business, I'll handle mine.

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:29.463
      I don't want nothing
       to do with ya'll.

01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:32.132
    - Somebody's riding the
   murder of a federal agent,

01:24:32.134 --> 01:24:33.901
either you or Fitz, you choose.

01:24:36.972 --> 01:24:39.673
      You think this is a
       game or something?

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:41.842
     - Are you ready to go
         down for this?

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:45.079
 And we got you on 12 separate
  drug and conspiracy charges.

01:24:46.148 --> 01:24:48.315
    You think this is over?

01:24:48.317 --> 01:24:49.383
          Be in touch.

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:56.990
    - Once the feds pop up,
    it can't get much worse.

01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:02.729
           Oh, shit.

01:25:02.731 --> 01:25:03.730
        Just got worse.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.601
       (deep tense music)

01:25:13.476 --> 01:25:15.542
      (soft radio chatter)

01:25:32.161 --> 01:25:33.594
    Can't even reach Kelly.

01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:35.829
     So she ain't coming to
      save me on this one.

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:39.500
      Let me talk to her.

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:40.634
      I don't even know if
       she's even alive.

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.236
       - Don't you worry,
       my little friend,

01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:44.138
 she is very, very much alive.

01:25:47.743 --> 01:25:50.344
       - [Terry] Amanda,
     Amanda, are you okay?

01:25:50.346 --> 01:25:53.580
 - Hey, hi, I feel really good.

01:25:56.152 --> 01:25:58.385
    - [Terry] What the hell
     have you done to her?

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:01.588
     - It seems Amanda have
 developed a very nasty habit.

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:06.493
   And she will do just about
 anything to scratch that itch.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.561
      - [Terry] Oh my god.

01:26:08.397 --> 01:26:10.364
     - So don't be stupid.

01:26:10.366 --> 01:26:13.367
    Or I will have to cancel
           on you and

01:26:13.369 --> 01:26:17.171
   whore this bitch out just
  to keep a smile on her face

01:26:17.173 --> 01:26:18.205
           and mine.

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:22.309
     (exciting rock music)

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:40.260
  - Man, I'm about to take my
  chances and play my own hand

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:43.330
  and be a snitch and let the
 feds play me out like a pawn.

01:26:44.233 --> 01:26:46.333
I'm cut from a different cloth,
           you know.

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:51.905
        (phone ringing)

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:54.908
       (deep tense music)

01:27:16.665 --> 01:27:19.499
     - [Fitz] You take care
    of this, kill them all.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:22.402
       (engines roaring)

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:35.709
          (gun firing)

01:28:56.231 --> 01:28:58.298
          (gun firing)

01:29:13.248 --> 01:29:14.581
     - How the hell did he
       get out of there?

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:16.917
    We had the whole fucking
      junkyard surrounded.

01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:18.085
     - He knew what was up.

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:21.955
Fuck, I popped Mia's ass though.

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:24.658
      - What have we done?

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.259
     Oh my god, there's no
    telling what he's gonna

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:27.094
         do to Amanda.

01:29:27.096 --> 01:29:29.830
        (phone ringing)

01:29:32.234 --> 01:29:34.201
             Fuck.

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:37.804
     - Terry, Terry, Terry.

01:29:38.674 --> 01:29:40.340
    You tried to set me up.

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:43.844
      - Look, please, man,
         please don't.

01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:46.847
   Please, I'll do anything,
      just don't hurt her.

01:29:46.849 --> 01:29:50.317
    - Well, I'm afraid your
     bitch is fucking dead!

01:29:51.186 --> 01:29:52.786
          (gun firing)
         - No, no, no!

01:29:52.788 --> 01:29:54.254
    No, I just heard a shot!
          - No, what?

01:29:54.256 --> 01:29:56.123
         - He shot her!
             - No!

01:29:56.125 --> 01:29:57.090
     - He just shot her, I
    heard it, they shot her

01:29:57.092 --> 01:29:58.925
    and then it went silent.

01:29:58.927 --> 01:29:59.926
             - No.
            - Fuck!

01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:01.161
          - Call him.

01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:02.395
      - What have we done.
        - Are you sure?

01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:05.599
         You gotta pull
       yourself together.

01:30:06.869 --> 01:30:08.101
    - Pull myself together?

01:30:10.372 --> 01:30:14.274
    I got nothing. Don't you
        understand that?

01:30:14.276 --> 01:30:16.076
     She was my everything.

01:30:16.078 --> 01:30:19.112
       - I know, I'm so,
        so sorry but...

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:22.115
       (slow tense music)

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:27.721
    - Go ahead if you think
      you're fast enough.

01:30:27.723 --> 01:30:31.091
     - I don't give a fuck,
   kill me, I'm ready to die.

01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:37.330
   - I got a special delivery
            for you.

01:30:37.332 --> 01:30:40.967
       (slow tense music)

01:30:40.969 --> 01:30:44.171
   Here's your package if you
        still want her.

01:30:44.173 --> 01:30:44.371
       She's a mess now.

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:52.078
        - Oh shit, man,
      I owe you the world.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.849
    - You don't owe me shit,
    it's all business, ese.

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:58.952
    - Well, I'm afraid your
     bitch is fucking dead!

01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:03.423
     (slow rhythmic music)

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.793
          (gun firing)

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:08.195
- [Terry] No, no, I just heard a
             shot!

01:31:08.864 --> 01:31:11.431
       - We're even here.

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:13.999
 - Since we killed Mia and she
  killed all Smiley's homies,

01:31:14.002 --> 01:31:15.869
  he felt he owed us for that.

01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:18.205
       So he popped Fitz
     and scooped up Amanda.

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:21.575
    Sometimes you never know
      how shit's gonna go.

01:31:21.577 --> 01:31:23.810
  You just gotta stick to the
           script and

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:26.279
    however it goes, that's
     how it's meant to be.

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:29.983
       (soft slow music)

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.590
- I see you got your girl back.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.559
    The only problem is you
      left a trail of dead

01:31:39.561 --> 01:31:41.261
      bodies to clean up.

01:31:41.263 --> 01:31:44.264
- Not me, I didn't kill anyone.

01:31:45.133 --> 01:31:48.201
- Don't matter, we got our man.

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.006
      Clean your girl up.

01:31:57.379 --> 01:31:59.946
           (mumbles)

01:31:59.948 --> 01:32:02.949
       (soft tense music)

01:32:07.489 --> 01:32:08.989
  - [Kelly] Well, hello there,
          pretty boy.

01:32:08.991 --> 01:32:13.126
       I see you're still
        alive and well.

01:32:13.128 --> 01:32:15.729
    - [Terry] Damn, I tried
     to call you for help.

01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:17.564
      Why'd you just leave
     me for dead like that?

01:32:17.566 --> 01:32:19.533
 - Am I talking to a dead man?

01:32:20.469 --> 01:32:23.303
    I knew you had it in you
     to get yourself out of

01:32:23.305 --> 01:32:26.339
whatever you got yourself into.

01:32:27.309 --> 01:32:29.609
   I had to leave you alone.

01:32:30.479 --> 01:32:32.178
          So you would
      find it in yourself.

01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:36.583
     (slow dramatic music)

01:32:39.521 --> 01:32:41.521
     (slow rhythmic music)

01:32:41.523 --> 01:32:44.558
      ¶ Yup, here we go ¶

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.059

 ¶ Keep his hand on his heat ¶

  ¶ On the grind day and night

01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.388
  ¶ Bitches with heat on 'em ¶

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:16.623
      ¶ If you ain't from
         the streets ¶

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:18.124
   ¶ Don't even speak on it ¶

01:33:18.126 --> 01:33:21.161
  ¶ Keep your mouth closed or
 you'll get knocked out cold ¶

01:33:21.163 --> 01:33:23.964
   ¶ I was forced into this,
  it's not the life I chose ¶

01:33:23.966 --> 01:33:26.766
    ¶ I'd much rather been a
   doctor or lawyer any day ¶

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:29.369
  ¶ Besides another convicted
       fella in the pen ¶

01:33:29.371 --> 01:33:31.371
  ¶ No matter how many rappers

01:33:31.373 --> 01:33:32.539

01:33:47.923 --> 01:33:49.990
