WEBVTT

00:11.077 --> 00:13.478
He was a good person,
and then he came here,

00:13.480 --> 00:16.081
and then he turned bad.

00:16.082 --> 00:19.350
It's been really affecting
my husband the most.

00:22.089 --> 00:25.156
He feels like his life
was taken as a sacrifice.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.293
It kind of creeps me out
to be here by myself.

00:29.295 --> 00:32.630
I'm hearing
"the Devil's Triangle."

00:32.631 --> 00:36.101
I just had no idea it was
this extreme and this bad.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.704
"Get out.
Get out of here.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.306
Get out now."

00:41.308 --> 00:44.575
And I just feel fear.

00:44.577 --> 00:46.377
My name is Amy Allan.

00:46.379 --> 00:49.514
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.715
I see dead people.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.984
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.786
I speak to dead people.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.722
She hates them, hates them.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.125
And they speak to me.

01:00.127 --> 01:03.727
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:03.729 --> 01:07.065
It's a demon.
It's Satan.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.666
I rely on my partner.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.201
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.136
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.872
What was the body count,
what happened?

01:13.874 --> 01:17.542
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.076
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

01:19.078 --> 01:20.412
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.080
It's my job to reveal them.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.548
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.550
But Steve and I never speak...

01:26.552 --> 01:28.486
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.821
...until the very end...

01:29.823 --> 01:31.889
I don't even want
to show you this.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.958
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:33.960 --> 01:36.027
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.096
...or time to get out.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.497
You have to get out.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

01:51.778 --> 01:53.578
I'm back
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

01:53.580 --> 01:56.247
because I got a call
from a woman named Diane.

01:56.249 --> 01:59.650
She went and opened up a tattoo
parlor in an old building.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.986
Now all hell has broken loose.

02:01.988 --> 02:03.988
Artists don't want
to be there alone,

02:03.990 --> 02:06.323
and customers
don't think it's safe.

02:06.325 --> 02:08.126
Look, I know the tattoo crowd,

02:08.127 --> 02:09.793
and they don't scare
that easily,

02:09.794 --> 02:13.131
so for them to call us in
for help, it's got to be bad.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.002
It's tough to hide the fact
that this is a tattoo parlor,

02:18.004 --> 02:19.938
but I still need to cover
leading information,

02:19.940 --> 02:23.608
like artwork, workstations,
and personal items

02:23.610 --> 02:26.143
that could influence
Amy's findings.

02:26.145 --> 02:29.680
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:41.361 --> 02:44.028
There's something bad here.

02:49.035 --> 02:51.168
There's this dead guy.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.305
He kind of felt like he was
a good person,

02:54.307 --> 02:57.108
and then he came here,
and then he turned bad.

02:57.110 --> 03:01.646
He's like, you know, the
devil-influence kind of thing.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.516
Yeah, this place,
it's hella confusing, man.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.785
Literally, I'm hearing
"the Devil's Triangle,"

03:07.787 --> 03:09.120
and he's just warning us.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.722
He's like, "Just go.
Just get out. Just run."

03:17.597 --> 03:19.530
So, Diane, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:19.532 --> 03:20.932
it sounded like things
were pretty bad.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.132
I mean,
what's going on here?

03:22.134 --> 03:23.868
The paranormal activity
in the place

03:23.870 --> 03:26.403
has gotten
really out of control.

03:26.405 --> 03:29.140
I think it's dangerous,
and it's scaring our clients.

03:29.142 --> 03:32.210
It's scaring our artists,
and it scares me.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.012
So, Diane, when did stuff
start happening?

03:35.014 --> 03:37.081
Two years after we opened,
we expanded.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.884
Okay.
When we expanded,
things got worse.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.352
What's happening?

03:41.354 --> 03:43.821
We're hearing
disembodied voices.

03:43.823 --> 03:47.025
We're feeling watched
all the time.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.759
Objects are being thrown.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.494
We see shadow figures.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.096
People are being
physically touched,

03:52.098 --> 03:55.232
and everyone's been
having terrible mood swings.

03:55.234 --> 03:58.302
It's been really affecting
my husband the most.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.637
Any reason why?

03:59.639 --> 04:01.973
He's had struggles in the past
with mental illness.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.775
He was
just diagnosed bipolar.

04:03.777 --> 04:04.842
Okay.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.978
And I feel like
whatever's here

04:06.980 --> 04:10.181
amplified
all of his symptoms

04:10.183 --> 04:14.451
and made his anxiety and
depression way more intense.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.387
I'm very worried about him.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.721
Now, how does your husband
feel about

04:17.724 --> 04:19.057
this whole paranormal thing?

04:19.059 --> 04:21.125
He doesn't put much stock
into it.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.460
Alright.
You think he'd talk to me?

04:22.462 --> 04:23.861
I think you could try.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.331
What are you hoping
we can do for you?

04:26.333 --> 04:28.532
I'd really like to know
what's here,

04:28.534 --> 04:31.535
and I'd really like to know
how to get rid of it.

04:31.537 --> 04:35.206
It just is really depressing
to not feel welcome in something

04:35.208 --> 04:39.010
that you put
so much passion and love into.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.945
So, Diane, why do you think this
stuff is actually happening?

04:41.947 --> 04:43.748
I think it wants us
out of this space,

04:43.750 --> 04:45.549
and I think
that it's not afraid

04:45.551 --> 04:47.084
to hurt someone
to get us out.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.692
The dead dude, he's just, like,
crying and freaking out,

04:54.694 --> 04:56.226
and he's like, "Just go.

04:56.228 --> 04:58.229
Just get out
before it's too late."

05:01.301 --> 05:04.769
I think that people would hear
a man crying.

05:04.771 --> 05:08.506
He made himself real tiny,
like, into a ball,

05:08.508 --> 05:11.842
so I think they might see,
like, little black balls.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.311
I'm hearing something about
some kind of sacrifice ****

05:14.313 --> 05:15.513
going on.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.720
He feels like his life
was taken as a sacrifice.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.789
Is that something that might
happen to the living here?

05:24.791 --> 05:25.990
Yes.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.462
Okay, so, Diane,
why are we over here?

05:31.464 --> 05:33.831
What's going on?
I hear a lot of banging,

05:33.833 --> 05:35.065
a lot of knocking,

05:35.067 --> 05:38.602
strange noises that don't
really have any cause.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.337
Where are you hearing it
exactly?

05:40.339 --> 05:42.206
It seems like in the walls
and the ceiling.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.609
It's an old building,
though, right?
Right.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.077
Could it be the plumbing?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.612
These walls
are really thick.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.948
They're concrete, and the
plumbing has a distinct sound.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.684
When we hear the noises,
it's different.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.219
Okay.
Anything else?

05:55.221 --> 05:56.688
Yeah.
In the last few months,

05:56.690 --> 06:01.892
we've had a lot of artists
with physical illnesses.

06:01.894 --> 06:05.162
People have to take weeks
off at a time to recover.

06:05.164 --> 06:08.099
We are definitely missing
business because of it.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.369
So, now, is any of this
sickness stuff affecting you?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.970
Physically,
I don't really get sick,

06:12.972 --> 06:15.239
but the anxiety is
really getting to me.

06:15.241 --> 06:18.509
So I usually leave
because I feel too anxious

06:18.511 --> 06:21.478
and just like
I'm being watched,

06:21.480 --> 06:23.714
like something's close to me,
and I don't like it.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.849
Alright.
So, anything else?

06:24.851 --> 06:26.918
I see,
and a couple other artists

06:26.920 --> 06:29.053
have seen, black figures

06:29.055 --> 06:31.122
out of the corner
of our eyes.
Okay.

06:31.124 --> 06:35.593
I've also seen
black, like, blobs, kind of.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.195
It scares me.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.998
Progressively, it has gotten
more and more menacing-feeling,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.868
and the anxiety kicks in,
and it just...

06:43.870 --> 06:45.669
Off-the-charts scared.

06:49.275 --> 06:53.277
I'm seeing a couple dead guys
up there.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.212
And there's yelling.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.682
There's, like, screaming.

06:57.684 --> 07:02.753
I think that the living
would possibly see them.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.689
They would hear them yelling.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.831
I feel very sick and panic.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.033
Very panicky.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.968
I felt like somebody
was coming at me.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.839
Like, a male, I think,
was coming at me real fast.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.041
They're, like, throwing
people down the stairs.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.113
So, the living would feel panic,

07:29.115 --> 07:30.714
like, panic-stricken.

07:36.255 --> 07:38.055
When we expanded
into this space

07:38.057 --> 07:40.591
is when things got
a little crazy.

07:40.593 --> 07:41.659
So, what's going on?

07:41.661 --> 07:44.261
A dark shadow came out
from behind me,

07:44.263 --> 07:46.464
and when I started to walk
towards the staircase,

07:46.466 --> 07:47.932
it followed me.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.600
Did you feel like you were
about to get mugged?

07:49.602 --> 07:51.602
I mean, how'd it feel?
It felt menacing,

07:51.604 --> 07:55.505
and it was just
an instinctual "Get out."

07:55.507 --> 07:56.808
Alright.
So, what else?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.010
We've had clients complain

07:59.012 --> 08:01.612
while they're getting tattooed
that someone touched them

08:01.614 --> 08:03.681
or someone's standing
behind them,

08:03.683 --> 08:05.749
and there's no one there.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.019
You realize how lucky you are
no one's gotten hurt yet?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.219
Yeah.
Alright.

08:09.221 --> 08:11.689
Like, we took the time
to build this up,

08:11.691 --> 08:14.759
and it means the world to us,
and it's really upsetting.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.160
Alright. Okay.

08:18.898 --> 08:23.834
I'm seeing an older man --
50s, 60s.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.169
I think he's kind of crazy.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.575
He says he doesn't really
belong here,

08:31.577 --> 08:33.510
that he was brought here,

08:33.513 --> 08:37.381
but now since he's here,
he feels like he owns it.

08:37.383 --> 08:38.715
This is his.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.784
Does he have any interaction
with the living?

08:40.787 --> 08:44.188
Well, I think they hear
his fits, when he's, like,

08:44.190 --> 08:47.792
stomping around
and hitting things.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.194
He beats on the walls.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.396
He beats on the floors.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.398
He stomps around.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.533
He yells.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.870
I think the living would
experience all of these things,

08:59.872 --> 09:03.474
which also means that he could
potentially become physical

09:03.476 --> 09:05.543
with living people,
and he's like,

09:05.545 --> 09:08.613
"Get out of here. Get out.
Get out of here.

09:08.615 --> 09:09.813
Get out now."

09:37.409 --> 09:39.142
So, Shannon, I understand
that you and Diane

09:39.144 --> 09:40.877
are business partners.
Yeah.

09:40.879 --> 09:43.213
She described some of the stuff
that's going on here,

09:43.215 --> 09:44.748
and she thinks
it's pretty dangerous.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.416
I mean, you agree with her?
I agree.

09:46.418 --> 09:50.020
It's escalating,
and it concerns me.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.554
Can I assume
you've had experiences?

09:51.556 --> 09:52.756
Yeah. For sure.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.157
Okay, so let's talk
about some of them.

09:54.159 --> 09:55.825
One of the first things
that I clearly remember

09:55.827 --> 09:58.961
is seeing an apparition
upstairs on the second floor.

09:58.963 --> 09:59.896
What'd you see?

09:59.898 --> 10:01.831
I saw
a man walking into a room --

10:01.833 --> 10:04.301
black dress shoes
and gray dress pants.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.570
Are you sure it wasn't
one of the other artists
that were here?

10:06.572 --> 10:07.704
Yeah. I'm sure.

10:07.706 --> 10:09.906
I checked.
There was nobody there.

10:09.908 --> 10:11.441
So, what else?

10:11.443 --> 10:13.376
Well, just last week,
I was tattooing someone,

10:13.378 --> 10:17.314
and my sweatshirt
got pulled from behind.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.915
That could be
really dangerous with you

10:18.917 --> 10:21.451
holding a needle
to someone's skin.
Yeah.

10:21.453 --> 10:22.586
So, was there anybody else
in the shop

10:22.588 --> 10:24.721
that could have done it?
No, no.

10:24.723 --> 10:26.590
And nobody would ever
physically touch you.

10:26.592 --> 10:27.924
When I was talking to Diane,

10:27.926 --> 10:30.861
she was telling me
about personality changes

10:30.863 --> 10:33.663
with personnel,
and mostly with Josh.

10:33.665 --> 10:35.531
Have you noticed it?
Yes.

10:35.533 --> 10:37.533
When I agreed to be
business partners with him

10:37.535 --> 10:39.803
probably
about 5 years ago now,

10:39.805 --> 10:42.806
he was
not what he turned into.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.942
Okay, so what kind of changes
have you seen in Josh?

10:45.944 --> 10:47.210
It's a lot of stuff.

10:47.212 --> 10:49.812
More depression, but
he would have these episodes

10:49.814 --> 10:52.949
where he would be
irrational and angry.

10:52.951 --> 10:54.951
And you try talking to him
about them later,

10:54.953 --> 10:58.221
and he has no recollection
of these events.

10:58.223 --> 10:59.823
So, we've seen this
in other cases,

10:59.825 --> 11:01.424
where whatever's
in the home

11:01.426 --> 11:04.227
or the business is
influencing whoever's there.

11:04.229 --> 11:05.962
Do you think that's what's
going on with Josh,

11:05.964 --> 11:08.097
or you think he's
just being an ****

11:08.099 --> 11:09.432
I believe
it's influencing him.

11:09.434 --> 11:12.169
Okay. So, with all the stuff
that's going on here,

11:12.171 --> 11:15.037
did you ever think
about just calling it quits

11:15.039 --> 11:16.506
and packing up and leaving?

11:16.508 --> 11:17.774
There have
definitely been times

11:17.776 --> 11:19.309
when I've wanted
to leave here.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.977
Okay.
It's hard.

11:20.979 --> 11:21.978
It really is.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.181
This is
my home away from home.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.782
We worked really hard
to get here,

11:25.784 --> 11:28.785
and I'd be really devastated
to have to leave.

11:28.787 --> 11:30.320
Okay.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.254
Alright.

11:34.326 --> 11:39.729
There is evil here,
and it comes up from the ground.

11:39.731 --> 11:41.998
There's three evil entities.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.466
I think they're demons.

11:43.468 --> 11:46.402
And they call this place
the Devil's Triangle.

11:46.404 --> 11:48.338
Someone sold their soul,

11:48.340 --> 11:51.007
and now they are coming
to collect.

11:55.814 --> 11:57.748
I'm seeing a dead guy
in a coffin.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.149
He's the one
who sold his soul.

12:00.151 --> 12:02.185
He's the cause of all this.

12:02.187 --> 12:04.153
He, like, legit sold his soul.

12:04.155 --> 12:06.222
He summoned
those demon-devil things.

12:09.494 --> 12:11.628
So, after talking to Diane
and Shannon,

12:11.630 --> 12:13.630
I wanted to see what
their employees had to say.

12:13.632 --> 12:15.131
I was sitting downstairs,

12:15.133 --> 12:17.901
and two pictures
fell off the wall.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.904
I was the only one here.
Okay.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.173
All of them are having
bizarre experiences.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.108
I hear voices.

12:25.110 --> 12:28.778
It tends to be mostly
a male kind of shouting.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.981
I can never make out
specific words.

12:30.983 --> 12:35.519
It's an angry kind of
mocking or scolding.

12:35.521 --> 12:38.254
Like, it kind of creeps me out
to be here by myself.

12:38.256 --> 12:40.657
And if these guys
are freaked out to be here,

12:40.659 --> 12:42.192
you know things got to be bad.

12:42.194 --> 12:45.061
I saw a white mist
in my station.

12:45.063 --> 12:49.399
It was hovering towards
where that wall is.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.067
You ever see anything
like that again?

12:51.069 --> 12:54.270
Yes. I saw shadows kind of
out of the corner of the eye

12:54.272 --> 12:55.472
when I'm working.

12:55.474 --> 12:56.673
Somebody walks
into the room,

12:56.675 --> 12:58.408
and I look up,
and there's no one there.

12:58.410 --> 13:03.079
I feel like it's
a very hateful, angry energy

13:03.081 --> 13:05.682
that is coming
from this building.

13:10.355 --> 13:12.822
The demon thing.
I mean, they come and go.

13:12.824 --> 13:14.023
What do these things
look like?

13:14.025 --> 13:15.625
There's a little one.

13:15.627 --> 13:21.030
That one has white shiny eyes
and is, like, a little person.

13:21.032 --> 13:25.035
And then there's a big guy.
Really big guy.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.903
It seems like the devil.

13:26.905 --> 13:31.241
He had, like,
shiny soft skin,

13:31.243 --> 13:35.245
and it was black,
and he had horns.

13:35.247 --> 13:39.048
Living people might see, like,
evil-looking ****

13:47.191 --> 13:49.459
So, Josh, I understand
you're Diane's husband.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.727
Yes.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.462
She thinks that whatever's
going on in this building

13:52.464 --> 13:53.663
is pretty dangerous.

13:53.665 --> 13:54.965
I mean,
do you agree with that?
No.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.334
I don't really believe
in that stuff.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.801
I mean, things used to
fall off the walls,

13:58.803 --> 14:01.204
and it's annoying,
but other than that,

14:01.206 --> 14:04.474
I don't see anything.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.943
Okay. Now, one of the main
reasons she called us in

14:06.945 --> 14:08.478
was because
she's worried about you.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.947
Are you aware of that?
Yeah.

14:10.949 --> 14:13.617
Thinks maybe you've been
having some mood changes.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.085
Anything like that
going on with you?

14:15.087 --> 14:19.422
I have bipolar, but I've
been crazy all my life.

14:19.424 --> 14:22.492
Every, like, 6 months,
you get manic,

14:22.494 --> 14:23.893
and you're depressed
for a while.

14:23.895 --> 14:26.629
Then medicine helps.

14:26.631 --> 14:29.099
But you don't see a change
in you since you've been here?

14:29.101 --> 14:30.967
Nope. I've been
the same **** a long time.

14:30.969 --> 14:32.235
Okay.

14:32.237 --> 14:34.103
I've always had
an aggressive personality.

14:34.105 --> 14:35.171
Things might be happening,

14:35.173 --> 14:36.906
and they're
not telling me nothing.

14:36.908 --> 14:38.307
Well,
why do you think that is?

14:38.309 --> 14:39.909
They're afraid
of the way I'm gonna act,

14:39.911 --> 14:42.445
and they think I'll get mad
or something.

14:42.447 --> 14:43.980
Well, that brings me
to another question --

14:43.982 --> 14:45.315
Are you annoyed
we're here?

14:45.317 --> 14:47.917
A little bit, but,
you know, whatever.

14:47.919 --> 14:49.386
Alright.

14:52.924 --> 14:57.593
These demon things
come up in here.

14:57.595 --> 15:00.997
I think
that they are dangerous.

15:00.999 --> 15:04.066
They can do attachments
if they feel like it.

15:04.068 --> 15:08.872
They look for people
who are prone to addictions

15:08.874 --> 15:13.343
or not living what they felt

15:13.345 --> 15:16.413
was a good life,

15:16.415 --> 15:21.550
and that's what these things
jump onto and take advantage of.

15:21.552 --> 15:24.687
They basically feel like
they own anyone

15:24.689 --> 15:28.358
and everything that comes
into that space.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.628
I mean, these things
take their souls.

15:51.248 --> 15:53.782
So, this isn't our first case
in Pittsburgh,

15:53.784 --> 15:56.385
so I already know a lot
of the local experts.

15:56.387 --> 15:58.987
One of them is a local
professor who just called me.

15:58.989 --> 16:02.324
Now, he says one of the guys
who used to own Diane's property

16:02.326 --> 16:04.326
made himself real wealthy,

16:04.328 --> 16:06.461
but it came with
a very high price.

16:12.035 --> 16:14.136
So, Professor, you mentioned
on the phone that the guy

16:14.138 --> 16:16.471
that owned my client's property
was crazy rich.

16:16.473 --> 16:19.008
Now, who was this guy,
and how did he make his money?

16:19.010 --> 16:21.009
His name
is George Bennett.

16:21.011 --> 16:22.144
Okay.

16:22.146 --> 16:24.312
He opens a bar in 1868

16:24.314 --> 16:26.615
about two blocks
from your client's business,

16:26.617 --> 16:28.884
and that's how his empire
got started.

16:28.886 --> 16:31.419
But it also brings a lot
of troubles to his family

16:31.421 --> 16:32.688
and his personal life.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.423
What kind of troubles
are we talking about?

16:34.425 --> 16:37.893
1876, he gets into a fight
with one of his patrons.

16:37.895 --> 16:39.628
Patron swings first.

16:39.630 --> 16:42.564
George finishes the fight
by knocking him down,

16:42.566 --> 16:45.767
and he hits his head,
dies of his injuries.

16:45.769 --> 16:47.836
Okay. So was he charged
with murder?

16:47.838 --> 16:49.237
He is charged with murder,

16:49.239 --> 16:51.840
pleads not guilty
by virtue of self-defense.

16:51.842 --> 16:53.575
He's acquitted.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.310
I mean, did it kill
his business?

16:55.312 --> 16:57.446
No.
His business grew after that.

16:57.448 --> 17:00.582
He went into partnership with
his father and brothers,

17:00.584 --> 17:03.118
and they merged as one of
the leading distributors

17:03.120 --> 17:05.721
and producers of alcohol.

17:05.723 --> 17:09.124
Here's an ad
for his product.

17:09.126 --> 17:11.126
Alright.
So business was obviously good.

17:11.127 --> 17:13.061
They were doing quite well.

17:13.064 --> 17:14.662
From their sale
and distribution

17:14.664 --> 17:15.864
and manufacture of alcohol --

17:15.866 --> 17:19.201
$83,000 in one year.

17:19.203 --> 17:22.069
Today's money --
$2.3 million.

17:22.071 --> 17:24.205
Okay, so, what happens
after that?

17:24.208 --> 17:28.143
In 1891, he bought
your client's property.

17:28.145 --> 17:29.411
What's he do with it?

17:29.413 --> 17:31.480
He puts
an eight-story building on it.

17:31.482 --> 17:34.283
He used it for his business,
for the distillery.

17:34.285 --> 17:35.684
So, on the phone,
you mentioned

17:35.686 --> 17:36.952
that all this wealth
came at a price.

17:36.954 --> 17:38.220
What did you mean?

17:38.222 --> 17:41.089
George tries to take over
the entire business.

17:41.091 --> 17:42.423
He takes his father
to court,

17:42.425 --> 17:44.559
forces his father
out of the business,

17:44.561 --> 17:47.696
and by 1907, he's managed
to push all his brothers

17:47.698 --> 17:49.098
out of the business, also.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.566
Okay,
so, when does he die?

17:50.568 --> 17:53.835
He dies in 1912
at the age of 63.

17:53.837 --> 17:56.171
I guess all that backstabbing
caught up to him in the end.

17:58.776 --> 18:01.042
I'm seeing the dead guy
in the coffin again.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.914
Can you tell anything
about him in life?

18:05.916 --> 18:09.918
Really a long time ago.
I would say 1850s, '60s.

18:09.920 --> 18:13.322
He imported things
or something,

18:13.324 --> 18:15.924
and then I guess
he just bought land.

18:15.926 --> 18:18.861
He owned a lot of this area.

18:18.863 --> 18:20.329
He wanted to be rich.

18:20.331 --> 18:21.863
He's the cause of all this,
though.

18:21.865 --> 18:25.400
He summoned
those demon things.

18:25.402 --> 18:30.072
This area that this triangle
encompasses is affected.

18:30.074 --> 18:33.075
This triangle or whatever
is a result of him

18:33.077 --> 18:35.243
selling his soul
to those demon things.

18:37.948 --> 18:40.148
Okay, so,
now George Bennett's dead.

18:40.150 --> 18:41.283
What happens to the money,

18:41.285 --> 18:43.418
the business
and my client's property?

18:43.420 --> 18:46.221
It all goes to the wife
and the surviving children.

18:46.223 --> 18:50.559
About $16.5 million
is the value of the business

18:50.561 --> 18:52.494
and the cash in the bank.
Alright.

18:52.496 --> 18:54.563
So, what happens to my client's
building at this point?

18:54.565 --> 18:56.331
The family
keeps the building,

18:56.333 --> 18:58.366
and then there's
another piece of bad luck.

18:58.368 --> 18:59.701
Alright.
So, what happened?

18:59.703 --> 19:02.237
It breaks out in a fire
that destroys the building.

19:02.239 --> 19:03.639
Anybody die?

19:03.641 --> 19:05.039
13 people were injured,

19:05.041 --> 19:06.708
but, thankfully,
no one died.

19:07.978 --> 19:09.844
They ever figure out
what caused the fire?

19:09.846 --> 19:12.314
Well, the fire inspector
thought it was arson,

19:12.316 --> 19:14.849
but they could not
find out who did it.

19:18.989 --> 19:21.256
These demon things
are just bad.

19:21.258 --> 19:23.525
I don't like this.
This is not good.

19:26.196 --> 19:28.529
I'm getting, like,
gas or smoke,

19:28.531 --> 19:32.267
like, all gray
and, like, thick.

19:36.539 --> 19:41.210
There's snow on the ground,
and the place is on fire.

19:41.212 --> 19:44.545
These evil things,
they did set the fire,

19:44.547 --> 19:46.281
because they were bored.

19:53.890 --> 19:56.024
So, I'm headed over
to meet a retired cop

19:56.026 --> 19:58.093
who's been digging through
old records for me.

19:58.095 --> 20:01.262
Now, he found out that
an officer was beaten to death

20:01.264 --> 20:04.499
150 yards
from Diane's building.

20:04.501 --> 20:06.635
He says this is
a really strange case

20:06.637 --> 20:08.370
and something that's
definitely gonna be important

20:08.372 --> 20:09.838
to my investigation.

20:15.846 --> 20:17.312
Well, Bob, thanks
for meeting with me

20:17.314 --> 20:18.713
and helping me out
with this case.

20:18.715 --> 20:20.248
So, now, you mentioned
on the phone,

20:20.250 --> 20:22.317
cop was murdered down the street
from my client's property.

20:22.319 --> 20:23.585
What the hell happened?

20:23.587 --> 20:27.655
On April 24, 1872,
patrolman John Stacks

20:27.657 --> 20:29.457
of the Pittsburgh
Police Department

20:29.459 --> 20:31.793
was patrolling
your client's neighborhood.

20:31.795 --> 20:35.864
He went in for lunch
to a local saloon,

20:35.866 --> 20:37.332
ordered some oysters,

20:37.334 --> 20:39.668
and at that time,
he walked out

20:39.670 --> 20:41.336
without paying
for the oysters.

20:41.338 --> 20:42.738
So, what happened
after that?

20:42.740 --> 20:44.139
He walks out without paying.

20:44.141 --> 20:47.475
Three men
followed him outside,

20:47.477 --> 20:50.011
and they beat him,
fracturing his skull

20:50.013 --> 20:52.147
and causing
a severe brain injury.

20:52.149 --> 20:54.349
He was beaten to death.

20:54.351 --> 20:56.751
Three people were eventually
arrested for the crime --

20:56.753 --> 20:59.420
the bar owner, the saloon
owner, Henry Bender;

20:59.422 --> 21:03.425
William Kocher;
and Samuel Golden.

21:03.427 --> 21:04.892
Did they go to trial?

21:04.894 --> 21:06.627
They went to trial,

21:06.629 --> 21:10.699
and Bender and Golden
were found not guilty.

21:13.103 --> 21:15.637
Explain that to me.
How did they get off on that?

21:15.639 --> 21:18.106
There were several witnesses
that were called

21:18.108 --> 21:20.242
by the prosecution
that didn't show.

21:20.244 --> 21:22.444
They
mysteriously disappeared.

21:22.446 --> 21:23.445
That's interesting.

21:23.447 --> 21:24.646
It's almost like Mob stuff.

21:24.648 --> 21:25.714
Yeah.

21:25.716 --> 21:27.715
So, help me wrap my head
around this.

21:27.717 --> 21:30.585
I find it hard to believe
that an on-duty cop is whacked

21:30.587 --> 21:31.920
because he didn't pay
for oysters.

21:31.922 --> 21:33.321
Any thoughts?
Any theories?

21:33.323 --> 21:35.857
Stacks may have been involved
in some illegal activities.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.125
Okay.

21:37.127 --> 21:39.728
And he was known to make
very physical arrests,

21:39.730 --> 21:42.797
so he may have injured
some people,

21:42.799 --> 21:45.000
and at one point,
he actually killed someone

21:45.002 --> 21:46.268
while making an arrest.
Alright.

21:46.270 --> 21:47.536
So it's either
criminal activity,

21:47.538 --> 21:49.671
or payback is a possibility.
Absolutely.

21:49.673 --> 21:52.273
Alright, so, what happened
to these three guys?

21:52.275 --> 21:55.076
Kocher and Golden,
no one knows what occurred --

21:55.078 --> 21:56.277
what happened to them.

21:56.279 --> 21:59.348
Now, Henry Bender
became a social pariah,

21:59.350 --> 22:03.217
and he became an alcoholic,
and he lost his bar,

22:03.219 --> 22:04.952
so he became destitute,

22:04.954 --> 22:10.425
and he eventually died
at age 43.

22:10.427 --> 22:12.294
Karma came back
to get him.

22:14.898 --> 22:17.499
I feel sick again.

22:17.501 --> 22:21.703
And I'm hearing,
"You lying bastard!

22:21.705 --> 22:23.838
You piece of ****

22:23.840 --> 22:26.775
I'm gonna **** kill you!"

22:29.913 --> 22:32.180
These voices are all yelling
at the crazy guy,

22:32.182 --> 22:34.182
who's always throwing fits.

22:36.653 --> 22:39.321
He's like, "**** damn it,
you have to believe me."

22:39.323 --> 22:41.256
Yeah,
he just remembers being outside.

22:43.794 --> 22:46.928
Some dude hurt his head,
something like that.

22:46.930 --> 22:50.532
I think he was murdered outside.
It was bad.

22:56.473 --> 22:59.073
For more information
about the show,

22:59.075 --> 23:00.675
and if you need us

23:00.677 --> 23:02.477
unexplained activity
in your home...

23:07.884 --> 23:09.050
and we'll help if we can.

23:24.633 --> 23:27.435
So far, I've got a bunch
of tough tattoo artists

23:27.437 --> 23:30.103
scared to be at work
by themselves in a building

23:30.105 --> 23:32.706
that burned to the ground
in the '30s,

23:32.708 --> 23:36.510
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

23:36.512 --> 23:38.979
Searching through old records,
I find a land developer

23:38.981 --> 23:41.214
who used to own
my client's property.

23:41.216 --> 23:44.185
Turns out he committed suicide.

23:44.187 --> 23:46.320
So what can make
a big-shot developer

23:46.322 --> 23:48.322
suddenly shoot himself
in the chest?

23:48.324 --> 23:51.592
I don't know, so I reached out
to a board-certified genealogist

23:51.594 --> 23:53.394
who knows all about this case.

23:53.396 --> 23:54.862
She says the answer could be
summed up

23:54.864 --> 23:57.398
in one powerful word -- money.

24:02.404 --> 24:04.138
Elissa, it's good
to see you again.

24:04.140 --> 24:06.607
So, I know the guy that bought
my client's property

24:06.609 --> 24:08.609
at some point
killed himself over money,

24:08.611 --> 24:10.344
but before we get to that,
who was this guy?

24:10.346 --> 24:11.945
His name was Hunt Miller.

24:11.947 --> 24:14.415
He bought the property
that your client

24:14.417 --> 24:17.484
has expanded into in 1920.
Alright.

24:17.486 --> 24:18.685
So, what can you tell me
about this guy?

24:18.687 --> 24:20.955
He made his money
in real estate,

24:20.957 --> 24:23.758
but he also was
into sports promotions

24:23.760 --> 24:26.360
and moving-picture theaters,

24:26.362 --> 24:29.830
and in the 1910s, '20s,
that was cutting-edge stuff.

24:29.832 --> 24:31.499
Alright. So this guy
is involved in all kinds

24:31.501 --> 24:33.300
of flashy stuff
at the time.

24:33.302 --> 24:34.502
Anything
I would have heard of?

24:34.504 --> 24:37.037
He was the manager
and acting president

24:37.039 --> 24:40.241
of the Duquesne Ice Gardens,

24:40.243 --> 24:44.111
and he was also president
of the Amateur Hockey League,

24:44.113 --> 24:47.782
and that was the predecessor
of the National Hockey League.

24:47.784 --> 24:49.316
Alright, so this guy's
got his hands

24:49.318 --> 24:51.051
in real estate,
hockey teams.

24:51.053 --> 24:52.920
I mean,
was he making good money?

24:52.922 --> 24:54.388
For a while, he was.

24:54.390 --> 24:57.324
In the 1920s, when he bought
your client's property,

24:57.326 --> 24:59.794
he was flying high,
so to speak.

24:59.796 --> 25:02.063
He had a wife
and a teenage son.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.098
He had a very nice home,

25:04.100 --> 25:06.934
where he had
two live-in servants.

25:06.936 --> 25:08.201
Alright.
So he's doing well.

25:08.203 --> 25:09.470
He's got money.
He's got servants.

25:09.472 --> 25:10.737
What the hell happened?

25:10.739 --> 25:13.073
He was involved in
a sports-corruption scandal

25:13.075 --> 25:14.475
that got really ugly.

25:14.477 --> 25:17.211
The amateur hockey players
were actually being paid,

25:17.213 --> 25:19.079
which was
against the rules.

25:19.081 --> 25:20.213
What happens?

25:20.215 --> 25:23.751
He actually filed
for bankruptcy in 1923.

25:23.753 --> 25:27.154
He owed over $350,000,

25:27.156 --> 25:30.424
which in today's money,
would be almost $5 million.

25:31.794 --> 25:34.295
I know he kills himself.
What went down that day?

25:34.297 --> 25:37.898
So, he woke up one morning
on August 24, 1926,

25:37.900 --> 25:40.434
and shot himself
in the chest.

25:40.436 --> 25:42.503
He was 44 years old
when he died.

25:42.505 --> 25:44.972
This is
his death certificate.

25:44.974 --> 25:47.841
He left his wife
and 15-year-old son destitute.

25:47.843 --> 25:50.044
So, he was kind of doing
really well for himself,

25:50.046 --> 25:51.979
and then it all went
downhill for this guy.

25:56.251 --> 25:58.986
I'm seeing
the crying man again.

25:58.988 --> 26:00.554
Can you describe him?

26:00.556 --> 26:02.256
He's just kind of small --

26:02.258 --> 26:06.527
white shirt,
button-down collar.

26:06.529 --> 26:09.463
He has dark hair.

26:09.465 --> 26:11.599
He was a father.

26:11.601 --> 26:13.067
Do you know
what he did here?

26:13.069 --> 26:16.903
Something with money.
Doing bad things with money.

26:16.905 --> 26:19.406
And I'm kind of wondering
about gambling a little bit,

26:19.408 --> 26:23.010
'cause I feel like
he owed money, too.

26:23.012 --> 26:25.412
He's like, "Yeah,
I was bad and cheated."

26:25.414 --> 26:29.550
He said, "I was not
a good person."

26:29.552 --> 26:32.353
He did say, like,
he **** everybody over.

26:32.355 --> 26:34.287
Did he die here?
Yes.

26:34.289 --> 26:39.426
I want to say, like,
the 1940s,

26:39.428 --> 26:41.028
maybe the '50s.

26:41.030 --> 26:44.498
He feels like his life
was taken as a sacrifice

26:44.500 --> 26:47.167
to these demon things.

26:47.169 --> 26:50.104
He was just, like,
crying and freaking out.

26:56.712 --> 26:58.979
I saw several
disturbing things on my walk,

26:58.981 --> 27:00.714
but two stood out --

27:00.716 --> 27:03.984
first, the man in the coffin
who sold his soul.

27:03.986 --> 27:09.790
He had excessive bags
under his eyes,

27:09.792 --> 27:15.062
a lot of expression lines
up here from doing this.

27:19.135 --> 27:24.004
Eyes are a little bit softer,
and they were really deep.

27:24.006 --> 27:27.741
Next, I described the three
demons who collect souls.

27:27.743 --> 27:33.280
In the corner is this guy
who's in a tight ball, crying,

27:33.282 --> 27:37.817
and then, to the left,
are these three demon things.

27:37.819 --> 27:40.354
No eyeballs.
Just the sockets.

27:40.356 --> 27:42.923
No nose.
Just the openings.

27:42.925 --> 27:45.159
They do have
really sharp teeth.

27:49.632 --> 27:53.167
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:53.169 --> 27:55.235
Yes.
That's what I saw.

28:20.196 --> 28:23.196
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:23.198 --> 28:25.465
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

28:25.467 --> 28:29.403
and our clients
for the first time.

28:29.405 --> 28:31.004
So, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Diane

28:31.006 --> 28:33.407
and her business partner,
Shannon.

28:33.409 --> 28:35.943
Now, when they opened up
this tattoo parlor

28:35.945 --> 28:38.012
a few years back
with Diane's husband, Josh,

28:38.014 --> 28:41.081
it was basically a dream
come true for you guys.

28:41.083 --> 28:42.816
Now, these two ladies
are tough, right?

28:42.818 --> 28:45.886
And so is their clientele,
but everyone's scared,

28:45.888 --> 28:47.354
so you know
it's got to be bad.

28:47.356 --> 28:50.023
In fact, the activity here
is getting so physical,

28:50.025 --> 28:53.027
these two ladies don't think
it's safe to be here.

28:53.029 --> 28:56.096
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about your situation,

28:56.098 --> 28:57.965
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

29:02.170 --> 29:05.170
So, upstairs
in the middle room,

29:05.172 --> 29:09.308
there's an older, very
conscious dead male there.

29:09.310 --> 29:11.376
I would have put him
in his 60s.

29:11.378 --> 29:14.046
He was very upset
that I was here,

29:14.048 --> 29:15.714
did not want
to talk to me,

29:15.716 --> 29:19.919
and one of the things he kept
saying to me was, "Get out."

29:19.921 --> 29:22.921
This guy is just
completely insane.

29:22.923 --> 29:26.792
He does flare up
into fits of anger.

29:26.794 --> 29:30.529
He's, like, stomping around
and hitting things.

29:30.531 --> 29:33.131
He beats on the walls.

29:33.133 --> 29:35.334
He beats on the floors.

29:35.336 --> 29:37.269
He stomps around.

29:37.271 --> 29:38.738
He yells.

29:38.740 --> 29:40.940
I hear, like, a bang.

29:40.942 --> 29:42.274
Like, it's so loud
that you think

29:42.276 --> 29:44.743
it's a customer
or a client coming in.

29:44.745 --> 29:46.145
And you guys
also have problems

29:46.147 --> 29:47.947
with stuff
flying off the wall.
Yes.

29:47.949 --> 29:50.382
We had a terrible time
with our paintings.

29:50.384 --> 29:53.485
We had to screw them onto
the wall to get them to stay.

29:53.487 --> 29:57.289
Wow. I think
this guy could pose

29:57.291 --> 30:00.625
a potential threat
physically to people,

30:00.627 --> 30:02.428
which makes me nervous.

30:02.430 --> 30:04.430
You had your shirt tugged,
right?

30:04.432 --> 30:05.765
Tell Amy what happened.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.966
I was sitting there,
working on this guy's arm,

30:07.968 --> 30:11.637
and I just felt the back of
my sweatshirt get pulled down.

30:11.639 --> 30:13.438
Now, all the stuff
that's happening to them,

30:13.440 --> 30:15.074
is that all this crazy guy,
or is this...

30:15.076 --> 30:17.310
Well, that does sound
like him.

30:17.312 --> 30:20.513
Yeah.

30:20.515 --> 30:23.515
Okay, so, what else?

30:23.517 --> 30:27.520
Next person I encountered
was a dead male.

30:27.522 --> 30:30.255
He's really upset
about being here.

30:30.257 --> 30:35.461
He cries and freaks out
all the time.

30:35.463 --> 30:39.131
He had dark hair.
It was neatly cut and gelled.

30:39.133 --> 30:40.266
White button-down shirt,

30:40.268 --> 30:43.268
starched dress pants,
nice shoes.

30:43.270 --> 30:45.338
I actually saw
an apparition of a man,

30:45.340 --> 30:48.874
but all I saw was the back
of his heels and his legs.

30:48.876 --> 30:51.143
But he had on dress shoes --

30:51.145 --> 30:54.747
they were black --
and pressed gray pants.

30:54.749 --> 30:56.615
Okay.

30:56.617 --> 30:59.018
Any idea who this guy might
have been when he was alive?

30:59.020 --> 31:01.486
I am putting him
in the 1940s.

31:01.488 --> 31:03.756
He was married,
a father.

31:03.758 --> 31:09.628
I don't know what his job was,
but it had to do with money.

31:09.630 --> 31:13.565
But I got that he did
owe somebody money.

31:13.567 --> 31:16.569
So, I couldn't tell if this
was related to gambling

31:16.571 --> 31:19.171
or something else.

31:19.173 --> 31:22.041
He admitted to screwing over
his family, his co-workers,

31:22.043 --> 31:25.510
his friends,
really everybody in his life.

31:25.512 --> 31:28.380
He said that he was
a good person,

31:28.382 --> 31:30.382
and then he came here,

31:30.384 --> 31:34.586
and that
he kind of turned bad.

31:34.588 --> 31:37.523
So, I got an idea
of who Amy might have seen.

31:37.525 --> 31:39.124
Now, this guy's name
was Hunt Miller,

31:39.126 --> 31:41.793
and he bought
the property in 1920,

31:41.795 --> 31:45.297
specifically the building
you guys expanded into.

31:45.299 --> 31:47.800
This guy was the president
of the Duquesne Gardens,

31:47.802 --> 31:50.536
and at the time, it was one
of the largest ice hockey rinks

31:50.538 --> 31:52.471
in the entire country.

31:52.473 --> 31:55.006
He was also involved
in theater promotion.

31:55.008 --> 31:56.809
Now, the expert I spoke to
told me that Miller was

31:56.811 --> 32:00.346
a gambler, a real risk-taker
in his investments.

32:00.348 --> 32:02.147
But right after
he bought the property,

32:02.149 --> 32:04.884
everything went to hell
for him.

32:04.886 --> 32:08.353
First, he got caught up
in a sports-corruption scandal.

32:08.355 --> 32:10.823
So, after the scandal broke,
the place went bankrupt

32:10.825 --> 32:13.025
because of his mismanagement.

32:13.027 --> 32:14.760
Now, you said the guy
you saw owed money.

32:14.762 --> 32:19.031
At the end of all this,
Hunt owed $350,000--

32:19.033 --> 32:22.234
the equivalent
of nearly 5 million bucks today.

32:22.236 --> 32:23.702
****

32:26.307 --> 32:28.841
Now, this guy was so broken up
about what was going on

32:28.843 --> 32:32.978
in his life that he shot himself
in the chest in 1926.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.713
Whoops.

32:34.715 --> 32:37.917
He was 44 years old.

32:37.919 --> 32:41.186
I actually got ahold
of his death certificate here.

32:41.188 --> 32:42.855
He left his wife
and 15-year-old son

32:42.857 --> 32:45.323
basically destitute.

32:45.325 --> 32:46.525
I'm curious
if maybe you think

32:46.527 --> 32:49.594
Miller might be the guy
you ran into.

32:49.596 --> 32:52.664
Yeah.
I mean, it sounds like the guy.

32:54.869 --> 32:57.536
Okay, so,
what else is going on?

32:57.538 --> 33:00.672
The next thing I ran into
was very odd.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.542
I saw a man in a coffin.

33:03.544 --> 33:06.411
I put him in his late 60s,
early 70s.

33:06.413 --> 33:09.948
He was active
in 1860s or 1870s.

33:09.950 --> 33:16.221
He was buried in a very nice
black-and-gray suit,

33:16.223 --> 33:19.492
definitely had
a lot of money.

33:19.494 --> 33:21.426
He was in business,
and they kept repeating

33:21.428 --> 33:23.162
"importing and shipping."

33:23.164 --> 33:24.830
I got that he owned
this property

33:24.832 --> 33:29.367
and a bunch of other pieces
of property in the area.

33:29.369 --> 33:34.172
His sole desire was that
he wanted to be rich,

33:34.174 --> 33:39.378
and he got rich by doing
some very, very bad things.

33:39.380 --> 33:42.847
It's not a whole lot to go on,
but it does remind me

33:42.849 --> 33:45.518
of one of the early owners
of this property.

33:45.520 --> 33:49.321
His name was George Bennett, and
he was a ruthless businessman.

33:49.323 --> 33:50.856
Before he bought
this property,

33:50.858 --> 33:53.992
Bennett opened up a bar
a couple blocks from here.

33:53.994 --> 33:57.196
You got that he was alive
in the 1860s and '70s.

33:57.198 --> 34:00.399
Now, in 1876, Bennett wound up
getting into a fight

34:00.401 --> 34:02.134
with one of his patrons.

34:02.136 --> 34:05.137
Bennett hit him so hard,
his head hit the pavement,

34:05.139 --> 34:06.672
cracked his skull
and killed him.

34:06.674 --> 34:08.139
Damn.

34:08.141 --> 34:10.476
George claimed self-defense,
and the jury bought it,

34:10.478 --> 34:11.877
so he gets acquitted.

34:11.879 --> 34:13.879
After that, George went
into business with his father

34:13.880 --> 34:16.547
and his brothers
and started selling liquor.

34:16.550 --> 34:21.753
In 1889, they made 83,000 grand
in one year, cash.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.755
Today, it would have
been $2.3 million.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.090
Man.

34:25.092 --> 34:29.094
So they used that money
to buy this property in 1891.

34:29.096 --> 34:31.830
George built a huge
8- story building

34:31.831 --> 34:35.433
and operated
his liquor distillery here.

34:35.435 --> 34:37.502
This is the building
that was here.

34:37.504 --> 34:40.239
That makes sense.

34:40.241 --> 34:42.708
Despite the success,
George wasn't satisfied

34:42.710 --> 34:45.110
splitting the profits
with his family,

34:45.112 --> 34:47.379
so he pushed them
all out one by one.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.447
Wow.

34:48.449 --> 34:50.449
First his father,
then his brothers.

34:50.451 --> 34:54.252
He died in 1912
at the age of 63.

34:54.254 --> 34:57.990
I was able to track down
a photo of this guy.

34:57.992 --> 35:01.260
You think this is the guy
you saw in the coffin?

35:01.262 --> 35:05.797
I had a sketch done
of the person I saw.

35:12.139 --> 35:14.206
Yeah.

35:14.208 --> 35:17.075
You ladies tell me.

35:17.077 --> 35:19.411
My God.
Looks pretty close to me.

35:19.413 --> 35:22.681
Yeah.
I'd say so.

35:22.683 --> 35:24.483
They look similar,
for sure.

35:24.485 --> 35:27.953
But do you think it's this guy,
George Bennett?

35:27.955 --> 35:29.421
**** yeah.

35:29.423 --> 35:33.292
That matches,
which is not good...

35:33.294 --> 35:35.027
'cause he ****
everybody.

35:35.029 --> 35:36.361
No.
I'll just tell you that.

35:36.363 --> 35:38.430
This man in this coffin,

35:38.432 --> 35:41.767
he's responsible for, like,
the bad things here

35:41.769 --> 35:47.305
because he brought three,
like, evil entities here.

35:47.307 --> 35:49.441
He summoned them.

35:49.443 --> 35:52.845
They have been around causing
chaos for a very long time.

35:52.847 --> 35:54.979
They were like, "At one time,
we were so bored

35:54.981 --> 35:57.782
that we just, like, set
the building on fire for fun."

35:57.784 --> 35:59.017
Wow.

35:59.019 --> 36:00.319
Now, in 1935,

36:00.321 --> 36:02.120
the building
burnt down to the ground.

36:02.122 --> 36:03.855
This thing?

36:03.857 --> 36:05.457
- This building?
- Yeah.

36:05.459 --> 36:08.193
The fire department believed
it was caused by arson,

36:08.195 --> 36:11.864
but they were never able to
figure it out or who did it.

36:11.866 --> 36:14.132
My God.
That's so crazy.

36:14.134 --> 36:16.334
They did this in the past.
Can they do it now?

36:16.336 --> 36:17.936
Yes.

36:17.938 --> 36:22.207
So, basically, these demons
were summoned by him.

36:22.209 --> 36:26.945
He sold his soul to get
everything he wanted.

36:26.947 --> 36:28.413
They took him when he died.

36:28.415 --> 36:31.717
They have his soul.

36:31.719 --> 36:34.019
When they're around,
I feel like the living

36:34.021 --> 36:36.421
could experience them
in a few different ways.

36:36.423 --> 36:37.756
I think you might see them.

36:37.758 --> 36:40.492
I'm not sure how you would
interpret them, though.

36:40.494 --> 36:42.628
Like, if they would
be shadow figures or what --

36:42.630 --> 36:44.029
I don't know.

36:44.031 --> 36:47.031
You guys talk about
shadow figures here.

36:47.033 --> 36:48.900
It's always
in my periphery,

36:48.902 --> 36:50.569
but I sometimes
feel like I'm --

36:50.571 --> 36:53.505
Something's
following me around.

36:53.507 --> 36:55.507
They affect people mentally.

36:55.509 --> 36:56.575
They look for people

36:56.577 --> 36:59.444
who already have seeds
of darkness in them --

36:59.446 --> 37:02.247
addiction issues,
gambling problems,

37:02.249 --> 37:04.182
possible depression.

37:04.184 --> 37:09.921
They identify, and then
they go in, and they exploit.

37:09.923 --> 37:14.059
And once they start,
it just doesn't stop.

37:14.061 --> 37:16.728
So, Amy, you actually hit on
one of the biggest reasons

37:16.730 --> 37:18.530
Diane called us in.

37:18.532 --> 37:23.668
I feel like my husband
gets the focus

37:23.670 --> 37:26.738
of the weirdness
or the darkness here.

37:26.740 --> 37:31.143
Like, he just fell back
into depression and anxiety

37:31.145 --> 37:32.878
and into addiction.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.412
You saw it, too.
Right, Shannon?

37:34.414 --> 37:37.882
Yeah.
He'd be completely irrational.

37:37.884 --> 37:40.085
The activity would tend
to flare up, too,

37:40.087 --> 37:43.155
whenever he was having
bad times.

37:43.157 --> 37:46.425
If they find somebody
they're interested in,

37:46.427 --> 37:49.828
they can attach that way.

37:49.830 --> 37:52.898
I was afraid that something
had attached to him...

37:52.900 --> 37:56.768
Okay.
...and that it was
torturing him.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.904
It's connecting
a lot of dots.

37:58.906 --> 38:01.239
So, you said these little
demon things look different.

38:01.241 --> 38:02.440
How did they look to you?

38:02.442 --> 38:04.443
So, I did have a sketch
of what I saw.

38:10.384 --> 38:12.317
What the ****

38:18.592 --> 38:20.792
****

38:20.794 --> 38:22.194
My God.

38:28.001 --> 38:31.003
I don't know what I think
about this.

38:31.005 --> 38:32.871
I don't want them here.

38:32.873 --> 38:34.806
I don't like it at all.

38:34.808 --> 38:36.741
I don't want to be here
right now.

38:36.743 --> 38:40.746
I'm worried about
their future activities.

38:40.748 --> 38:43.815
They really did burn
the building down.

38:43.817 --> 38:46.885
This is
not a good place to be.

38:46.887 --> 38:50.422
I'm not feeling good
at all about this.

38:50.424 --> 38:54.826
I just had no idea it was
this extreme and this bad.

39:16.776 --> 39:19.543
So, Diane, Shannon,
you both told me

39:19.545 --> 39:23.915
you thought this place was
dangerous, especially for Josh.

39:23.917 --> 39:25.583
Now we know you were right.

39:25.585 --> 39:28.520
What we don't know
is if you can fix this

39:28.522 --> 39:31.856
or if you need to get the hell
out of here and cut your losses.

39:31.858 --> 39:33.857
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:37.397 --> 39:41.466
The first thing would be finding
a male medium who's strong

39:41.468 --> 39:47.004
to talk to and remove the
crazy guy and the crying man.

39:47.006 --> 39:54.412
Then you're going to begin
doing weekly cleansings

39:54.414 --> 39:56.481
for 3 months,

39:56.483 --> 40:00.418
and then monthly cleansings
for a year.

40:00.420 --> 40:02.754
Will that take care
of these demon things?

40:02.756 --> 40:04.955
No.

40:04.957 --> 40:07.825
The negative, evil demons

40:07.827 --> 40:11.228
are always going to be
a potential threat.

40:11.230 --> 40:13.431
Unfortunately,
there's not a whole lot

40:13.433 --> 40:15.566
that can be done
about that.

40:15.568 --> 40:19.971
So there's no way of getting rid
of these little devil things?

40:19.973 --> 40:23.307
No.

40:23.309 --> 40:27.178
But one of the things
that they did say to me

40:27.180 --> 40:30.581
when I was down here
was that they weren't interested

40:30.583 --> 40:32.850
in the people
who were here right now.

40:32.852 --> 40:34.184
The only thing
you could hope for

40:34.186 --> 40:38.456
is that their interest
in you guys stays at bay.

40:38.458 --> 40:40.324
I'm wondering
if there's anything special

40:40.326 --> 40:41.726
we should be doing
for Josh.

40:41.728 --> 40:42.794
I would keep him
out of here

40:42.796 --> 40:44.995
until you get rid
of the crazy guy

40:44.997 --> 40:46.664
and the crying guy,

40:46.666 --> 40:50.067
'cause all of that's
gonna affect him.

40:50.069 --> 40:53.270
So, if they do
what you're telling them to do,

40:53.272 --> 40:56.074
they should see a difference
in activity, obviously, right?

40:56.076 --> 40:57.608
Yeah.

40:57.610 --> 41:01.011
And then people will start
feeling better probably, right?

41:01.013 --> 41:02.880
Stuff won't go flying
off the wall anymore.

41:02.882 --> 41:04.082
Correct.

41:04.084 --> 41:07.218
And once you get rid
of these two dead guys,

41:07.220 --> 41:08.953
hopefully Josh
will be feeling --

41:08.955 --> 41:10.054
start to feel better,

41:10.056 --> 41:12.023
and you'll want to be
around him.

41:12.025 --> 41:13.023
This could be a good thing.

41:13.025 --> 41:15.359
Not just a <i> paranormal</i> fix --

41:15.361 --> 41:17.762
This could also be
a <i> person</i> fix.

41:17.764 --> 41:21.699
The person that I know
that he is.

41:21.701 --> 41:23.701
Now you have to make
that decision

41:23.703 --> 41:25.636
'cause you still have
a threat no matter what

41:25.638 --> 41:27.905
that can come in
at any time.

41:27.907 --> 41:29.173
Yeah.

41:29.175 --> 41:30.240
It's a tough decision.

41:30.242 --> 41:31.575
Yeah.

41:31.577 --> 41:34.846
I mean, any idea
what you might do?

41:34.848 --> 41:37.648
I think we should stay, though,
and try and deal with this.

41:37.650 --> 41:40.852
We are gonna follow
Amy's advice to a "T,"

41:40.854 --> 41:45.389
and we're gonna stick around
and hope that things get better.

41:45.391 --> 41:47.258
I'm glad to hear that.
That makes us feel good.

41:47.260 --> 41:49.927
Trust me.

41:49.929 --> 41:53.064
I really hope Diane
and Shannon follow my advice.

41:53.066 --> 41:56.266
If they do, Josh should return
to his old self,

41:56.268 --> 41:58.001
and they can all work together,

41:58.003 --> 42:00.738
running the tattoo shop
they love so much.

42:04.744 --> 42:06.210
Hey, guys.

42:06.212 --> 42:08.413
Shop update.

42:08.415 --> 42:11.215
So, we've been following
all of Amy's instructions

42:11.217 --> 42:14.085
since you guys left,
and things have been great.

42:14.087 --> 42:17.755
We moved the energies out,
and we've been cleansing weekly.

42:17.757 --> 42:19.657
Josh has
also been really great.

42:19.659 --> 42:22.760
It's really changed the way
that he lives day to day.

42:22.762 --> 42:25.496
It really has been a
life-changing experience for us,

42:25.498 --> 42:27.031
and we're so grateful.

42:27.033 --> 42:28.499
Thank you.
