WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.171
Previously on CSI: Cyber...

00:03.204 --> 00:04.438
Agent Rupert Flemming!

00:04.472 --> 00:06.574
How are things across the pond?

00:06.607 --> 00:09.043
Agent Flemming can't come
to the phone right now.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.412
(drilling)
(Flemming screaming)

00:11.445 --> 00:13.147
RYAN: Miguel, Python
killed your partner.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.549
Rupert?
I'm on the next flight.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.684
MUNDO:
This is Python.

00:16.717 --> 00:17.685
He's one of the most violent

00:17.718 --> 00:19.353
cyber drug dealers
we've ever encountered.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.321
Get down!

00:20.354 --> 00:21.422
RYAN:
Hello, Dante.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.057
Or should I call you Python?

00:23.091 --> 00:24.725
Dante...
I'm sorry, ma'am...

00:24.758 --> 00:27.195
My mom's house.
You're in my house!

00:27.228 --> 00:28.196
You crossed the line.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.697
You made this personal.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.199
This is war.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.667
Python was here in CTOC!

00:33.701 --> 00:36.070
If he left something,
I want it found!

00:39.273 --> 00:41.275
(laughter)

00:42.743 --> 00:43.777
I swear to God.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.113
You made that up.

00:45.146 --> 00:45.979
No, I didn't.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.348
Friends and neighbors
used to show up

00:47.381 --> 00:49.117
with firewood
to heat the new home

00:49.150 --> 00:51.319
and to ward off
the evil spirits,

00:51.352 --> 00:53.454
and that's why they called it
a "housewarming."

00:53.487 --> 00:56.724
Look, I don't have
any evil spirits here.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.492
(both laugh)

00:58.526 --> 01:01.495
And this is all
the housewarming I need.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.397
Nah, we need
something else here.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.732
Um, all right,

01:04.765 --> 01:06.100
here we go.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.368
Let's do this right.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.237
Bread,

01:09.270 --> 01:12.473
so that your home
will never know hunger.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.574
Spices,

01:13.607 --> 01:15.576
so that your life

01:15.609 --> 01:18.146
will never be
without flavor.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.480
And red wine,

01:19.513 --> 01:21.382
so that joy and wealth

01:21.415 --> 01:22.650
will reign forever

01:22.683 --> 01:23.784
within these walls.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.486
Hmm.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.688
Nice.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.658
Oh, man.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.160
We got a lot of boxes here.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.861
We have to unpack all of these?
Yes.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.530
(laughter)
("Rock-a-Bye Baby" chiming)

01:38.199 --> 01:39.733
Do you hear that?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.702
I do.
Music box, right?

01:41.735 --> 01:43.571
But I don't have a music box.

01:44.905 --> 01:47.875
I think you do.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.211
(chuckles)
Over here someplace.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.414
Yeah.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.582
This one.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.584
But this,
this isn't my box.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.818
There's no moving label.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.588
Okay, that's a little weird.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.496
The music is coming
from this tablet.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.631
Do you know what that is?

02:10.664 --> 02:11.799
I don't understand.

02:11.832 --> 02:12.900
How can this be?
What?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.202
What is this?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.336
This is video

02:15.369 --> 02:16.704
the day that Hannah died.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.672
That's the car
she was riding in.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.308
These are the last moments
of my daughter's life.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.909
That was, like,
what-- 14 years ago?

02:21.942 --> 02:23.677
How did somebody
find this footage?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.381
Our nanny Renee
was driving.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.516
It was raining.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.883
They launched an investigation

02:29.917 --> 02:31.885
to see if she was negligent,
but she wasn't.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.622
"You couldn't
save your daughter,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.190
can you save me?"

02:36.224 --> 02:37.891
You have any idea who
the "me" is referring to?

02:37.925 --> 02:38.892
No.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.661
Okay, all right.

02:40.694 --> 02:41.862
I need to get this to CTOC.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.397
D.B., D.B.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.603
Okay.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.745
(Ryan grunts)

02:57.778 --> 02:58.879
(groans)

02:58.912 --> 02:59.980
Do you know this woman?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.915
I don't think so.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.454
(camera clicking)

03:11.992 --> 03:13.927
Anything in the tablet
we can use?

03:13.961 --> 03:14.828
It's not responding.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.730
I'll bag it,
take it back to Tear Down.

03:16.764 --> 03:17.898
See if she'll
talk to me there.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.300
All right.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.601
If anybody can make
a dead tablet talk,

03:20.634 --> 03:21.635
I'm looking at him.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.903
(laughs)

03:22.936 --> 03:23.937
(indistinct chatter)

03:23.971 --> 03:24.905
Severed head,

03:24.938 --> 03:26.474
cryptic message...

03:26.507 --> 03:29.243
and video of her daughter's
last moments?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.378
It's got to be tough.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.946
All right, so the moving company

03:32.980 --> 03:34.848
had 36 boxes they were
supposed to deliver.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.550
They dropped off 37.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.252
Said they thought
they just mislabeled one.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.753
We're going through all of them
right now to be safe.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.589
Listen, this perpetrator's

03:41.622 --> 03:43.023
meticulous and patient.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.625
I mean, they've been waiting
and they've been watching.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.028
As a precaution, I'm assigning
you a protection detail.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.798
Two cars, four agents
around the clock.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.367
Look, whoever did this is
a very determined individual.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.935
If they wanted me dead,
I would be dead.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.437
Not comforting.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.938
Their warning was,

03:57.971 --> 03:59.807
"You couldn't save your
daughter, can you save me?"

03:59.840 --> 04:01.742
Suggesting that the threat

04:01.775 --> 04:03.677
was against someone
that I care for.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.978
So the question is who?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.447
Thank you-- fingerprint
analysis from the bag

04:06.480 --> 04:08.015
we found the head in.
We got a hit.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.284
It's an Interpol agent.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.685
It's Miguel Vega.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.688
(grunts)

04:17.057 --> 04:19.293
I'm running out of time.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.362
So I need you to tell me.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.030
Where is Python?

04:23.063 --> 04:25.499
(grunts, spits)

04:25.533 --> 04:28.035
(groans)

04:28.068 --> 04:29.337
(grunting)
(phone buzzes)

04:29.370 --> 04:31.539
(phone ringing)

04:33.607 --> 04:35.776
(indistinct chatter)

04:35.809 --> 04:36.977
Krummy Krum, what's the
verdict on that tablet?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.746
KRUMITZ:
A whole lot of nothing.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.013
It's stripped clean.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.550
The serial number,
the video message to Avery

04:42.583 --> 04:44.051
and the "Rock-a-Bye Baby"
music file-- all dead ends.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.387
No prints, no DNA.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.323
There's not even a speck
of dust in this device.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.425
NELSON: Is that the code
that ran the video loop?
Yeah, it is.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.327
We're just about to take it
apart and see the magic.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.062
Yeah, but there's no way
to track our target.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.365
The only thing on the tablet
was the video.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.099
It's never been connected
to the Internet.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.336
And there's no record of it
syncing with another device.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.604
Yeah, but look.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.105
In the code, there's a pattern.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.607
The final character
of every line is useless.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.375
Isolate them.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.476
All right.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.645
There you go.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.914
"Now the games begin

05:13.947 --> 05:16.817
dot mist"

05:16.850 --> 05:18.819
It's an address to a site
on the Deep Web.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.820
This isn't by chance.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.522
Whoever did this wants us
to visit the site.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.123
Which means it could be a trap.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.458
That's why we're gonna
scan the site first

05:24.492 --> 05:26.126
to make sure it's safe.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.461
Then we'll let the games begin.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.732
RUSSELL: Okay, interesting,
all right, thank you.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.502
All right, so we're still
waiting for DNA results,

05:34.535 --> 05:37.505
but our Jane Doe
died from asphyxiation.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.039
And her head was removed

05:39.072 --> 05:40.974
postmortem.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.377
Avery, I think
whoever sent you this

05:43.411 --> 05:45.413
is sending you a
very clear message.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.715
Yeah, someone is telling me
this is just the beginning.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.417
Hey, you know what?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.084
Why don't I review
this clip for you?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.052
Give you some time.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.120
No, I have to do this.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.154
There's something in here

05:54.187 --> 05:57.425
only I can see.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.759
(quiet laugh)

05:58.792 --> 06:00.160
Thursday was Dance Day.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.930
Hannah would
wear her pink leggings.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.598
She had her thick pink headband.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.700
After class, I'd take her
to Court Street CafÃ©

06:06.734 --> 06:08.969
for strawberry milkshakes.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.439
But this day,
I had a patient emergency.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.007
My head knows
it wasn't anybody's fault.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.843
But sometimes my heart wonders:

06:15.876 --> 06:18.479
what if?

06:18.512 --> 06:19.847
I just spoke to Miguel's
supervisor at Interpol.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.682
Six weeks ago, he quit.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.417
Three days after that,
he entered the U.S.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.752
And he's been
dark ever since.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.087
Why would Miguel quit Interpol?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.089
Why are his fingerprints at the
scene of a potential homicide?

06:29.122 --> 06:30.624
MUNDO: I mean, two
theories spring to mind.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.093
Either he's a suspect
or he's in danger.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.194
We have a location on him?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.463
Would've been
impossible to track,

06:35.496 --> 06:36.864
except he checked
Avery's message.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.098
he was in Bethesda this morning.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.032
Okay, well, find him.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.934
We need to know
how he fits into all this.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.736
You got it.
(phone buzzing)

06:45.138 --> 06:47.675
Our, uh, presence is requested.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.110
(indistinct chatter)

06:50.143 --> 06:52.613
We found a Deep Web URL
buried in the code

06:52.646 --> 06:54.047
on the tablet.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.148
RAMIREZ:
NowTheGamesBegin.mist.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.149
This is where it led us.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.185
NELSON:
We have no idea
what the answer is.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.120
We don't even have a question.
I do.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.222
RAMIREZ: "You couldn't save your
daughter, can you save me?"

07:02.255 --> 07:04.458
Okay, so who's "me"?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.425
Who are we supposed to save?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.561
Miguel's fingerprints
were on the plastic bag.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.196
Type in "Miguel Vega."

07:11.098 --> 07:13.033
Okay, so family and friends

07:13.066 --> 07:14.167
are all accounted for.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.504
We're here.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.738
Maybe you need
to save yourself.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.773
Try "Avery Ryan."

07:23.276 --> 07:24.645
Raven?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.146
Video that was
on the tablet.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.749
Wait a second, the sign.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.783
Can you enlarge it?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.619
Yeah.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.722
"The path to salvation
is finding grace."

07:34.755 --> 07:37.224
After Hannah's accident,

07:37.257 --> 07:39.059
I drove past that church sign

07:39.092 --> 07:40.193
every day for three weeks.

07:40.227 --> 07:44.264
It said, "The path to salvation
is finding forgiveness."

07:44.297 --> 07:45.566
Not "finding grace."

07:45.599 --> 07:48.736
I remember distinctly because
I had a very difficult time

07:48.769 --> 07:51.204
forgiving myself or Renee.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.941
Krumitz, type in "Grace Clarke."

07:53.974 --> 07:56.577
RUSSELL:
The young girl who visited you
a couple months ago?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.111
RYAN:
She was Hannah's best friend.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.213
Her mom Renee was driving
the day of the accident.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.218
(crying)
RUSSELL:
Oh, no.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.590
Grace.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.258
(gasping)

08:11.291 --> 08:12.993
A-Avery?

08:13.026 --> 08:14.061
Is that you?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.228
RUSSELL:
Okay, we can see her.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.664
She can't see us.
Yes, Grace,

08:16.697 --> 08:17.931
honey, it's me!

08:17.965 --> 08:20.601
Avery, please,
you got to help me!

08:20.634 --> 08:23.571
He said that
if you can't save me,

08:23.604 --> 08:24.872
I'm gonna die!

08:24.905 --> 08:26.306
RYAN: Who's he?
Who abducted you?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.876
I don't know.
I didn't see his face.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.310
But he said that you knew him.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.546
Avery, please.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.214
Save me.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.883
He's gonna kill me!

08:40.588 --> 08:43.090
Dante hasn't lived here
in over 20 years.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.592
You made this personal!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.559
This is war.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.596
It was his mother.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.031
The head in the bag,
it was his mother.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.032
KRUMITZ:
Who, Avery?

08:52.065 --> 08:53.901
This is Python.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.769
He's back.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.805
(crying)

09:01.241 --> 09:07.648
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

09:09.349 --> 09:15.723
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

09:15.756 --> 09:19.059
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:19.092 --> 09:23.096
* I can see for miles
and miles *

09:23.130 --> 09:27.167
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:27.200 --> 09:30.938
* And miles...

09:30.971 --> 09:31.972
* Oh, yeah.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.719
GRACE (crying):
I don't want to die.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.888
Avery, please!

09:47.921 --> 09:49.022
No, honey, I'm not
gonna let that happen!

09:49.056 --> 09:51.659
Take a screen grab
of those vials.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.693
RYAN: I just need
you to focus.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.827
Close your eyes.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.362
And listen to my voice.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.797
Okay, okay, okay...

09:56.830 --> 09:57.665
Take a breath.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.899
Control your breathing.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.735
Clear your mind.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.671
Now, open your eyes,
tell me what do you see?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.272
(grunts)

10:05.305 --> 10:06.740
It's-it's a room.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.176
Uh, there's a red light.
It's dark.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.343
Except for the window.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.979
I-I see a mirror.
It's so cold!

10:12.012 --> 10:14.247
Can she see a camera?
Honey?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.316
Can you see the make
and model of the camera?

10:16.349 --> 10:19.386
Um, no, no, I can't see it.
It-It's too dark.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.022
Can you smell anything
or hear anything?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.824
Do you know anything
about where you are?

10:23.857 --> 10:25.358
No! No, he drugged me.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.760
He left me here.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.328
RYAN:
Your abductor's not there.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.430
Where were you taken from?
I don't know.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.033
Nice to see you again,
Deputy Director.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.134
It's been too long.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.369
Python, where is Grace?!
What have you done with her?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.772
Say a prayer and follow a star.
I'm sure you'll find her.

10:38.806 --> 10:39.940
You demented son of a...

10:39.973 --> 10:40.941
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.275
We're here to have fun.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.377
I created this game
for us to play,

10:44.411 --> 10:47.681
and if you win, you get
your precious Grace back.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.917
I'm not playing
any games with you!

10:49.950 --> 10:51.051
Can you track him?
I hope so.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.920
I think you'll change your mind
once you hear the rules.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.922
I pose questions,
you provide the answers.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.057
Correct answers buy you time.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.059
Wrong answers lead
to injections.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.129
Three injections, Grace dies.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.865
She lets go of
the trigger, she dies.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.467
If CTOC disconnects
from the Web site, you get it.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.871
Poisoning a helpless young girl
to get revenge on me?

11:10.904 --> 11:12.873
You're a coward.
PYTHON: And using my mother

11:12.906 --> 11:14.775
to bring down my empire
was an act of courage?!

11:14.808 --> 11:17.144
So is there a real chance that
we're gonna be able to save her,

11:17.177 --> 11:18.812
or is this just all for show?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.881
Well, Mr. Russell, it wouldn't
be much of a game

11:20.914 --> 11:22.382
if you couldn't win.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.316
What do you want, Dante?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.152
Dante's dead.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.120
I want you to know what it feels
like to lose everything.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.889
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.024
How much time do we have?

11:31.058 --> 11:33.827
Anything?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.128
We lost him.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.830
Avery? You there?
RYAN: I'm right here.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.498
If you don't hear me
for one second,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.901
I'm just dealing with something,
but I'm right here.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.235
Avery, what's happening?

11:42.269 --> 11:43.236
RUSSELL:
Okay, all right.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.371
So what do we got?

11:44.404 --> 11:45.372
"One among many.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.373
"Bound in leather.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.775
Right in front of you."

11:47.808 --> 11:49.242
Grace is right in
front of us and bound.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.912
Are we really going
to play Python's game?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.380
According to that timer,
we don't have much of a choice.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.248
Okay, Nelson, you and me,
we'll... we'll do the riddle.

11:55.282 --> 11:59.987
Python was right here in CTOC,
right in front of us,

12:00.020 --> 12:01.154
so let's start there.
Okay.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.890
Krum, let's work
on Grace's location.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.257
Yeah, I'm on it.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.859
Raven, when I am not
with her, you are.

12:05.893 --> 12:06.994
Keep her calm.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.763
Never leave her alone.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.232
Grace, I want you
to meet someone.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.401
Hi, Grace, my name is Raven.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.869
Avery, what's going on?!

12:15.903 --> 12:16.937
RYAN: Honey, Raven
is gonna stay with you.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.839
Right now, I need you
to tell her

12:18.872 --> 12:21.308
everything that you can
remember about being abducted.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.843
Can you do that?
GRACE: Okay.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.945
I'll try.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.115
Got this.
I have to call
Director Silver.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.117
Hi, Grace.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.119
Okay, "One among many.
Bound in leather.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.353
Right in front of you."

12:33.386 --> 12:35.155
Okay.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.524
The... the "you" refers
to Avery, right?

12:37.557 --> 12:40.160
Python was in her office,
so it's got to be in here.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.461
NELSON:
Books are bound in leather.

12:41.494 --> 12:46.066
RUSSELL:
Okay, let's start there.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.336
D.B.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.237
Found one.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.340
It's the only book
I see bound in leather.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.943
Treasures in Art.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.546
RYAN: Did you figure it out?

12:59.579 --> 13:00.613
RUSSELL: Yeah.
NELSON: Think so.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.283
Python must have noticed
this book in your office.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.818
He's using it to
play mind games.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.853
RUSSELL:
Okay, let's go.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.454
Treasures in Art.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.822
Okay.
RYAN: Wait, wait.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.190
Grace, can you hear me?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.993
I can hear you.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.295
The man who abducted you is
forcing us to solve a riddle.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.365
No matter what happens,
you hold tight to that trigger.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.466
You understand?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.301
Yeah.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.003
Yeah, let's do it. Okay.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.142
Avery, what's happening?
(groans loudly)

13:29.176 --> 13:31.078
Oh, my God, what's happening?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.145
Damn it, do something!

13:32.179 --> 13:34.381
"Bound in leather."
Wh-What-What are we missing?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.283
NELSON: Okay, the first clue
was about Avery's past.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.351
And then he laid out the rules,

13:38.385 --> 13:39.853
and-and now he's showing us
the consequences.

13:39.887 --> 13:40.687
The obvious answer's
not the answer.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.290
Wait a minute.
Medea the Sorceress.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.893
Right, Greek mythology,
when she was betrayed,

13:45.926 --> 13:48.896
she used a poisoned dress
to get revenge.

13:48.929 --> 13:49.930
NELSON: It's about the poison,
not the book.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.164
RUSSELL: Right?
Right.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.465
Python's poisoning Grace
with vials attached

13:52.499 --> 13:54.101
to her leather jacket. Right.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.003
"Medea the Sorceress," enter it.
Stop.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.238
We cannot afford to make
a mistake, D.B.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.406
We can't afford to wait.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.945
Do it.
Okay.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.415
(Ryan sighs)

14:09.582 --> 14:11.251
RYAN:
Grace, can you hear me?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.120
NELSON:
What are these numbers?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.387
RUSSELL: I have no idea;
maybe another riddle.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.990
All right, I'll get
started working scenarios.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.292
Why 183 minutes?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.997
RUSSELL:
You're not gonna believe this.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.334
183 BC is the year that
this picture was painted.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.502
You know, this stuff, it's just
gonna get harder and harder.

14:29.536 --> 14:33.373
Right? Both the puzzles
and the consequences.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.976
And Python is counting
on you losing focus

14:36.009 --> 14:37.444
and making
this personal.
It is personal.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.512
I know that,
I know that.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.514
Look, Avery, we're not
gonna let him win.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.684
Grace is alive,
and we're gonna find her.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.187
*

14:59.199 --> 15:00.433
(gun cocks)

15:05.672 --> 15:08.308
Who's the guy in
the chair, Miguel?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.343
What are you doing
here, Elijah?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.214
Avery sent me.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.316
Python's back.
She wants you at CTOC.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.285
I appreciate the invite,
but I'm working on a case.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.587
It's not an invitation.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.289
You left Interpol.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.491
You're not allowed to
work on American soil.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.427
*

15:27.460 --> 15:28.928
Hey.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.131
Listen.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.282
Grace Clarke.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.185
She's 19 years old,
and Python's got her.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.053
All right, so you can stay here

15:53.086 --> 15:54.254
and do whatever
the hell you're doing,

15:54.287 --> 15:55.355
or you can help save her life.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.726
RAMIREZ:
Okay, Grace, do you remember

15:59.759 --> 16:02.262
when and where
you were taken from?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.365
Last night, walking
to the library.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.434
Did you see the car
he was driving?

16:07.467 --> 16:10.103
No, it was too dark,
and it happened too fast.

16:10.137 --> 16:14.007
18 hours without
food or water.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.043
RYAN: Grace, I know that
you're hungry and thirsty.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.279
Try not to think about it;
the cravings will subside.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.580
Grace, did he harm you?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.382
He said he wouldn't hurt me.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.217
That if I die, it's your fault.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.220
Avery, I'm so scared.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.388
RYAN:
It's okay to be afraid.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.656
In this case, fear is good.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.525
It'll keep you alert,
keep you fighting.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.660
Use it to survive.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.104
What is it?

16:44.137 --> 16:46.606
Receiving reports
of mass equipment failure

16:46.639 --> 16:49.276
all in the last hour,
all on our network.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.677
There is an active intrusion
in CTOC.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.545
Python's attacking us
like we attacked him.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.546
It doesn't make
any sense.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.215
We have a firewall.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.217
He'd have to be inside.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.219
Look, we scan
the system daily.

16:59.252 --> 17:02.455
Yesterday it was clean, and now
we're crawling with malware.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.192
He could shut us down
at any minute.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.626
We have to fix this.
If we lose this system,

17:06.659 --> 17:09.129
we'll lose the connection
to Grace's site.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.163
If that happens, she will die.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.206
KRUMITZ: I took all nonessential
computers offline,

17:19.239 --> 17:20.673
but this intrusion
is everywhere.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.608
NELSON:
Guys, what's going on?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.476
Our login credentials
have been deleted.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.611
We're locked out the network.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.646
We can't get access
to the network,

17:26.679 --> 17:28.315
we're not gonna be able
to solve the next riddle.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.116
It's Python, he's
in our system.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.850
We're trying to
figure out how.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.719
NELSON: An active intrusion
means initiate shutdown

17:32.752 --> 17:33.820
and restore every system.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.623
If not, the entire FBI network
can be compromised.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.225
It's protocol,
it's not an option.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.159
Is it?

17:39.192 --> 17:40.827
No, we can't shut down--
we'll lose Grace.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.529
RYAN: All right,
notify every department.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.565
We're gonna initiate shutdown,
but we will stay online.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.567
Okay.
I'll catch up with
you in a minute.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.601
All right, the problems
in our network

17:48.635 --> 17:50.137
may have manifested today,

17:50.170 --> 17:51.604
but this infection
started months ago.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.573
Looks like November 23.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.543
That's the day that
Python walked into CTOC,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.711
planted some kind of
bug in our system.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.647
RAMIREZ:
That's impossible.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.349
We reinstalled every single
operating system,

18:02.382 --> 18:04.751
took every single precaution.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.288
Python was here in CTOC!

18:08.321 --> 18:09.556
Sweep everything!

18:09.589 --> 18:12.692
If he left something here,
I want it found.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.861
It's not impossible,
it's ingenious.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.230
He's using Grace's site
to take over CTOC.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.798
You vetted that
connection yourself.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.633
You said that it was safe.
It was safe. It is.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.802
There's nothing malicious
about the site itself.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.805
Python is using standard
Web traffic to trigger malware

18:25.838 --> 18:27.073
that's been lying dormant
in our system.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.509
That explains how the infection
was suddenly everywhere at once.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.281
Python left something behind
that we did not find.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.615
KRUMITZ:
Yeah, we got to find it now.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.783
I'm gonna get back
to the riddle.

18:36.816 --> 18:37.884
MUNDO:
Avery.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.353
What happened?

18:40.387 --> 18:42.689
Uh, we had a small
disagreement.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.924
We talked it through, came
to a mutual understanding.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.459
Right, Miguel?

18:46.493 --> 18:48.661
Raven, you're with Grace.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.497
Mr. Vega, you're with me.

18:52.699 --> 18:56.369
Illegal interrogations,
covert tactics.

18:56.403 --> 18:57.837
(sighs) If you
weren't my friend,

18:57.870 --> 18:59.706
you would be in jail,
not in my office.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.275
I got a lead on Python, Interpol
wouldn't let me follow up.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.810
So you quit?!

19:03.843 --> 19:05.412
I found one of his
personal couriers,

19:05.445 --> 19:06.613
the guy I interrogated.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.748
He just moved a shipment for
Python; I was tracking him.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.383
And you didn't trust me enough
to keep me in on this loop?

19:10.417 --> 19:11.518
For your own
protection.

19:11.551 --> 19:14.254
I can do things as a civilian
we can't do as agents.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.422
Python's mother's dead.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.424
He's trying to connect
you to her death.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.259
He left your print as evidence.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.428
So he's trying to frame me.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.731
Look, Python is getting nervous.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.565
He knows I'm getting close.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.899
That's why he's
trying everything

19:26.933 --> 19:28.535
to get me off
of his tail.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.603
Every second we spend on
talking, he gets further away.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.605
He's dangerous, Miguel.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.607
You going rogue,
that's exactly what he wants.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.742
It makes you vulnerable.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.777
Think about it.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.380
After Grace, you could be next.
So let me take him out first.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.715
Have you listened
to anything I've said?!

19:42.749 --> 19:44.251
Avery, every night
for three months,

19:44.284 --> 19:46.586
I put Rupert's baby boy,
my godson, to bed.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.255
And every night
he's terrified to tears

19:48.288 --> 19:50.323
that the bad man who hurt
his father will hurt him, too.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.894
Python killed my partner.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.797
I've given up everything
to find him.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.403
Forgive me if I'm on the edge.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.773
Okay, you go.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.310
But you're taking
Elijah with you.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.313
Thank you.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.916
RUSSELL:
The numbers from the riddle.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.619
Maybe it's an arithmetic
sequence, like Fibonacci.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.288
I checked, it's not.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.290
1-2-8 repeats,
beginning, middle and end.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.624
Right.
See?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.025
Maybe it's a key of some sort.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.361
Okay, so these aren't
just numbers.

20:28.395 --> 20:33.032
Then 1-2-8 in the world
of chemistry is written H2O.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.369
Most common substance on Earth.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.370
Right.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.906
And maybe 12... is magnesium.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.908
(cell phone buzzes)

20:41.941 --> 20:44.444
All these are elements
of the periodic table.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.045
D.B., this isn't a math problem.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.947
It's a recipe.
Right. 16.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.782
Sulfur.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.484
Yeah, these are
the ingredients.
(cell phone buzzes)

20:52.752 --> 20:54.721
I got to take care of this.
Why don't you stay here

20:54.754 --> 20:55.888
and get to cooking.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.057
I'll be right back.
All right.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.059
Avery, have you heard
from my mom?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.694
RYAN:
She's on her way.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.363
Her plane lands in an hour.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.431
(laughs)

21:04.464 --> 21:05.498
RYAN:
What is it?

21:05.532 --> 21:07.367
Finally got Mama on a plane.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.703
All it took was
abduction and torture.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.439
(laughing quietly)

21:12.472 --> 21:13.973
RUSSELL:
Hey.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.342
Just got word...

21:15.375 --> 21:17.477
DNA confirms that
the head in the bag

21:17.510 --> 21:18.811
is Renetta Wilkerson,

21:18.845 --> 21:21.314
Python's mother.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.515
Agents searched the house,

21:22.549 --> 21:24.784
found a suicide note... no body.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.553
She committed suicide?

21:26.586 --> 21:27.987
Ligature marks on the neck
suggest that, yeah.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.656
Well, Python removed her body

21:29.689 --> 21:31.791
and sent her head to my home.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.493
Which is a clear message
that he's holding me

21:33.526 --> 21:35.495
personally responsible
for his mother's death.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.629
Looks that way.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.097
I'd better get back.
No, no, D.B.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.401
Something's not right
with Grace.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.903
Her pupils are dilated,
she's giddy...

21:43.936 --> 21:46.439
Grace?

21:46.473 --> 21:47.674
How do you feel right now?

21:47.707 --> 21:48.675
Great.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.510
Better than I've felt in days.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.678
RUSSELL:
Glad to hear that.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.646
I think
Grace is stoned.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.848
Stoned?
Yeah.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.384
Python's death cocktail:

21:57.417 --> 21:58.651
The first drug

21:58.685 --> 22:00.687
was designed
to be nonlethal,

22:00.720 --> 22:01.854
but very painful.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.490
See the yellow tint?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.525
That suggests
potassium chloride.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.594
And then the second
drug is clear.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.061
Based on her behavior,

22:09.095 --> 22:11.798
I'm guessing that's some kind of
heroin or-or morphine.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.466
And then
the third one's

22:13.500 --> 22:14.967
probably some kind of sedative.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.803
How could you know that?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.505
Well, Python's objective

22:18.538 --> 22:20.440
is to get Grace
to release her grip, right?

22:20.473 --> 22:22.442
And if you look at the white
color in the third vial,

22:22.475 --> 22:24.477
I'm guessing that
that's Propofol,

22:24.511 --> 22:26.479
and that would be
a coup de grace.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.381
When that mixes
with the other two,

22:28.415 --> 22:31.484
Grace will fall asleep
and she'll suffocate.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.420
So each vial is designed

22:33.453 --> 22:35.588
to encourage her
to release the trigger--

22:35.622 --> 22:37.624
one with pain,
one with pleasure--

22:37.657 --> 22:39.091
but either way,
this third vial will kill her.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.694
Avery, I narrowed down
the area of intrusion.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.032
I just don't get it.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.100
We replaced all hardware
after Python was here.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.169
Every keyboard, mouse,
cable, everything.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.771
You replaced the chargers?

22:51.804 --> 22:52.872
Yeah, chargers,
computers...

22:52.905 --> 22:53.940
we replaced it all.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.476
And the surge protector?

22:56.509 --> 22:59.546
*

23:04.183 --> 23:06.419
KRUMITZ:
A single-board processor,

23:06.453 --> 23:07.454
16-gig hard drive,

23:07.487 --> 23:09.088
Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi antennas.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.590
This is how Python hacked CTOC.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.191
Avery, I am so sorry.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.426
I don't want apologies.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.461
I want answers.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.695
Um...

23:15.728 --> 23:18.030
Well, once Python
left it behind,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.499
it must've sat for months,

23:19.532 --> 23:20.867
eavesdropping
on our network traffic.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.503
Every time someone
logged into a station,

23:23.536 --> 23:25.438
it-it captured
their credentials

23:25.472 --> 23:26.573
and used them
to inject malware.

23:26.606 --> 23:27.974
That malware spread,

23:28.007 --> 23:30.810
infecting our entire
system, until today,

23:30.843 --> 23:32.078
when we streamed
Grace's video feed

23:32.111 --> 23:34.914
and Python used it to trigger
the infection and take control.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.483
So we have the video feed

23:36.516 --> 23:38.718
and the surge protector,

23:38.751 --> 23:39.986
and together,
they're a nasty combination.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.489
Can we use this information

23:42.522 --> 23:44.056
to kick Python
out of our system?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.758
The only way
to cut off his control

23:45.792 --> 23:47.093
is to close Grace's video feed.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.762
We can either protect CTOC
or keep Grace on-screen.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.797
We can't do both.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.499
(exhales)

23:52.532 --> 23:54.534
*

24:00.940 --> 24:02.875
The courier didn't
know Python's location,

24:02.909 --> 24:03.810
but he delivered
a shipment

24:03.843 --> 24:05.712
to this guy called Asher,
at this address.

24:05.745 --> 24:06.879
Asher?

24:06.913 --> 24:07.914
Yeah, that's what he said.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.115
What was the shipment?

24:09.148 --> 24:10.950
All Python shipments are
don't-ask-don't-die.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.218
It was large.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.553
Could've been anything.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.755
Guns, a bomb,
anything.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.557
(sighs)

24:17.590 --> 24:19.258
A plan to make some quick cash
for a getaway.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.193
Oh, yeah.

24:21.227 --> 24:25.632
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.265
Miguel.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.534
We don't have a warrant.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.068
Well, I'm not a cop.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.903
I don't need a warrant.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.939
*

24:53.993 --> 24:54.794
Asher.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.663
That's me.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.665
Who's asking?
Agent Mundo.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.299
FBI. I'd like to ask you
some questions.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.601
No problem.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.636
Let me set this down.

25:08.575 --> 25:09.809
Cover me.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.721
(grunts)

25:29.629 --> 25:30.630
(panting)

25:40.873 --> 25:42.842
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't do it. Don't!

25:42.875 --> 25:45.077
MUNDO:
Mr. Vega doesn't
work for me.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.278
I can't control him.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.615
If I were you, I would
answer my question

25:48.648 --> 25:49.782
so you don't have
to answer his.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.150
Do you know this man?

25:53.285 --> 25:54.253
Okay, okay!

25:54.286 --> 25:55.254
Okay.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.089
Okay...
Where's Python?

25:57.123 --> 25:58.825
ASHER:
I don't know any Python.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.126
I'm just a businessman, I swear.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.261
What kind of business?

26:02.294 --> 26:03.730
I get rid of things
need getting rid of.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.964
Be specific.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.601
(grunts) Bodies!

26:08.635 --> 26:10.870
I burn bodies. Oh...

26:10.903 --> 26:13.706
Dogs. Cattle. People.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.709
What was in
Python's shipment?

26:16.743 --> 26:17.977
An old lady with no head.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.046
I cremated her,

26:20.079 --> 26:21.180
gave the ashes to that guy.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.715
Wait, this guy was here?

26:22.749 --> 26:23.983
Yeah, this morning.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.685
I put the ashes in an urn...

26:25.718 --> 26:26.853
he took it and left.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.625
Okay, hold on.

26:32.659 --> 26:35.027
Avery, Grace is
asking for you.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.729
Grace.

26:36.763 --> 26:37.930
Honey, it's me.

26:37.964 --> 26:38.931
I'm here.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.867
Avery, will you do me a favor?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.234
Anything, sweetie.
What do you need?

26:45.171 --> 26:47.273
Can you tell my mom I love her?

26:47.306 --> 26:48.641
No. Grace.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.643
You are not giving up.

26:50.677 --> 26:51.778
We are solving these riddles.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.245
We're getting closer,
do you hear me?

26:53.279 --> 26:54.981
I'm so tired, Avery.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.716
I can't hold on.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.651
I'm not afraid anymore.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.352
Grace...

27:00.386 --> 27:01.688
Honey, I know you're hurting.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.189
I know you want this to end,

27:03.222 --> 27:05.024
but I'm not giving up on you.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.025
We're in this together.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.426
We need each other to make it.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.095
You remember when you first
came to visit me?

27:09.128 --> 27:12.298
I didn't want to reopen
that part of my life.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.333
It hurt too much.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.004
But it was your strength

27:18.037 --> 27:19.972
that made it easier.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.742
Grace, I need you
to listen to me.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.777
I need you to open your eyes...
(sobbing)

27:24.811 --> 27:27.179
I need you
to stand up and fight,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.816
'cause I'm not gonna
lose somebody I love...

27:29.849 --> 27:31.951
not today.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.292
I love you, too.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.660
RAMIREZ:
Avery...

27:43.830 --> 27:45.698
Okay. You stay with her.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.366
You let me know
if anything changes.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.970
I trust your judgment, Avery,

27:51.003 --> 27:53.272
but this isn't
about Cyber anymore.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.875
Every segment of
the FBI is offline,

27:55.908 --> 27:57.744
waiting for CTOC to reboot.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.146
(sighs) I just need
a little more time, Marcus.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.314
I have active operations
without technical support.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.150
Worse, Python
has access

28:04.183 --> 28:05.451
to sensitive FBI documents.

28:05.484 --> 28:06.786
We can't let this continue.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.387
A young girl's life is at stake.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.822
The entire bureau is at stake.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.323
Don't you think I know that?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.959
I've weighed every option.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.861
Assessed
every outcome.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.796
This is the right thing to do.

28:16.829 --> 28:17.964
Would you be making
the same call

28:17.997 --> 28:19.131
if this wasn't
someone you cared for?

28:19.165 --> 28:20.900
Without question.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.804
Then get it done.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.376
(siren whoops)

28:30.409 --> 28:31.377
(Mundo sighs)

28:31.410 --> 28:33.212
MUNDO:
All right.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.247
So let's go over
what we know so far.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.883
Python had his mother shipped
across country, cremated,

28:36.916 --> 28:38.417
and then picked up her ashes.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.418
Renetta Wilkerson,

28:39.451 --> 28:40.853
maiden name Collins.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.154
She was born in
Evansville, Pennsylvania

28:42.188 --> 28:43.856
and raised in
Topton, Pennsylvania.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.792
Both towns within
driving distance.
Then that's the answer.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.293
What do you mean?
Python shipped his mother

28:47.326 --> 28:49.762
all the way across the country
just to cremate her

28:49.796 --> 28:50.729
and then personally
picked up her remains?

28:50.763 --> 28:52.832
He's taking her home
to scatter her ashes.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.934
Yeah, but where?
Evansville? Topton?

28:54.967 --> 28:56.836
Towns are about 20 minutes
apart, both north of here.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.104
I say we go alphabetical order.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.238
I'll drive.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.108
*

29:19.591 --> 29:21.193
NELSON:
Yeah.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.194
RUSSELL:
Okay.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.796
*

29:25.932 --> 29:28.801
It's quartz.
As in the mineral?

29:28.835 --> 29:30.837
Yeah, a roundabout
way of making it,

29:30.870 --> 29:32.972
but that's what it is.
Quartz.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.173
So the answer to
the riddle is quartz?

29:34.206 --> 29:35.875
RUSSELL:
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

29:35.908 --> 29:36.876
The solution is quartz,

29:36.909 --> 29:39.879
but... there is no answer.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.180
NELSON:
I hear words,

29:41.213 --> 29:42.815
I-I just don't understand.

29:42.849 --> 29:43.983
Okay, all right, look.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.552
Python's mother grew up in
this area that had a lot of

29:46.585 --> 29:48.554
quartz mining, years ago,
but not anymore.

29:48.587 --> 29:49.922
Today, it doesn't exist.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.224
The obvious answer
is not the answer.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.060
I-I'm just saying

29:54.093 --> 29:56.362
I think we should leave
the answer field blank.

29:58.597 --> 29:59.966
(sighs)

29:59.999 --> 30:01.100
Okay.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.601
(sighs) Press "enter."

30:02.634 --> 30:04.236
All right.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.476
(all exhale)

30:11.978 --> 30:13.980
(laughs)

30:14.013 --> 30:15.414
What is that?

30:15.447 --> 30:17.616
Looks like a snake
eating itself.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.851
It's ouroboros.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.352
The Greek symbol for eternity.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.988
This is Python's
way of saying

30:22.021 --> 30:23.222
this could go on forever.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.992
These puzzles and games
are a stall tactic

30:26.025 --> 30:27.626
so that he could take over CTOC

30:27.659 --> 30:29.862
and force us to watch Grace die.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.898
We need to find a way
to end this now.

30:31.931 --> 30:32.731
KRUMITZ:
I got it.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.233
I think I have
a way to find Grace.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.468
But in order for us to save her,

30:36.502 --> 30:37.904
she may need to die.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.508
Okay, Grace?
This is Daniel Krumitz.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.010
Can you hear me?
Yes.

30:44.043 --> 30:44.944
Okay, I think I've figured out

30:44.977 --> 30:46.879
a way to find your location.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.515
And it'll be dangerous,
but it will work.

30:49.548 --> 30:50.616
Okay, there's
something called

30:50.649 --> 30:51.650
a Shodan Map.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.319
It shows us
the exact location

30:53.352 --> 30:54.887
of every device in the world

30:54.921 --> 30:55.854
connected to the Internet,

30:55.888 --> 30:58.590
including that camera
you're staring into.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.459
And we can use the Shodan Map
to find you,

31:00.492 --> 31:01.593
but I'm gonna need the make
and model of that camera.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.496
The only person who can get me
that information is you.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.933
GRACE:
I don't understand.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.068
Grace, we need you to try

31:09.101 --> 31:10.336
and reach the camera

31:10.369 --> 31:11.938
and give us the make and model.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.239
That information
will help us find you.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.607
But, Avery, I would have
to drop the switch.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.176
I mean, wouldn't that kill me?
RUSSELL: No.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.577
No, Grace, it won't.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.113
After you let go
and the last two vials inject,

31:21.147 --> 31:22.581
we have about 25 minutes

31:22.614 --> 31:25.017
to locate you
and send in rescue vehicles.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.352
It's our only option.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.088
Grace, listen, you can do this.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.024
Okay.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.060
Mmm... okay.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.930
Okay.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.331
(sighs)

31:39.365 --> 31:40.899
(groans)

31:42.034 --> 31:43.135
(grunting)

31:48.975 --> 31:49.942
(panting)

31:49.976 --> 31:52.111
(grunts)

31:52.144 --> 31:53.045
(groans)

31:53.079 --> 31:54.180
RYAN:
Grace!

31:54.213 --> 31:55.381
Are you okay?

31:55.414 --> 31:56.648
Yeah.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.985
I-I just can't see,
I can't see

31:59.018 --> 32:00.119
the camera. I can't see it!

32:00.152 --> 32:01.453
(sobbing)

32:02.654 --> 32:04.156
Wait! Wait!
I think I got something!

32:04.190 --> 32:05.657
Look at the top
of the frame.

32:05.691 --> 32:06.725
I think that's a mirror.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.960
I can see
the camera's reflection.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.228
Maybe I can get
the model number.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.197
It's a Tekshot TK20.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.300
Bad news.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.535
There's 227 of these cameras
on the Shodan Map.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.704
Can you narrow it down?
KRUMITZ: I'm working on it.

32:18.737 --> 32:21.007
Eliminate everything outside
of the continental U.S.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.609
Alaska gone, Hawaii gone.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.577
Still 214 cameras left.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.746
Grace, honey,
we will find you.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.116
(groaning)

32:30.149 --> 32:32.251
Ah, congratulations, Team Cyber.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.352
Well played.
Python!

32:33.385 --> 32:35.087
Took a little longer
than expected,

32:35.121 --> 32:37.489
but you seldom disappoint.

32:37.523 --> 32:38.991
If you kill her,

32:39.025 --> 32:40.026
I will find you!

32:40.059 --> 32:41.193
(groaning)

32:41.227 --> 32:43.162
You promise?

32:43.195 --> 32:45.731
This is all your fault,
Deputy Director.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.099
You're weak, Dante.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.035
You're not man enough
to come after me,

32:49.068 --> 32:51.303
so you pick on
an innocent little girl?

32:51.337 --> 32:52.504
What hurts more, Avery,

32:52.538 --> 32:55.107
dying or living
with the knowledge

32:55.141 --> 32:58.010
that somebody you love
is dead because of you?

32:58.044 --> 33:00.046
We both know the answer
to that question, don't we?

33:00.079 --> 33:01.047
Hey! Hey!

33:01.080 --> 33:01.747
Don't do this!

33:01.780 --> 33:03.149
I've truly come to appreciate

33:03.182 --> 33:04.450
your compassion and drive.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.352
It's a shame our time
has ended.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.157
(gasping)

33:11.190 --> 33:12.024
Yes.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.492
RYAN:
Python, don't!

33:13.525 --> 33:15.027
You can't do this!

33:15.061 --> 33:16.062
Grace!

33:16.095 --> 33:18.797
Guess you couldn't
save her, either.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.032
RYAN:
Grace!

33:29.841 --> 33:31.677
RYAN: Grace, stay with me.

33:31.710 --> 33:32.811
Listen to my voice.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.180
Focus.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.048
It's the only way
to survive this.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.416
I know that it's hard,

33:37.449 --> 33:39.118
but I need you
to stop struggling.

33:39.151 --> 33:39.785
(gasping)

33:39.818 --> 33:41.687
Okay.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.555
Now, take a short breath

33:43.589 --> 33:45.524
and hold it. Good.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.326
Your body's gonna relax.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.627
Now, in 90 seconds,

33:48.660 --> 33:50.162
you will lose consciousness.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.663
But I promise you,

33:51.697 --> 33:53.065
I'm gonna find you.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.666
Raven, get Elijah on the line.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.467
Every second counts.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.768
NELSON:
If Python's with Grace,

33:56.802 --> 33:58.137
he has to be

33:58.170 --> 33:59.004
within a six-hour radius

33:59.037 --> 34:00.839
of where Elijah found
the crematorium.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.674
MUNDO: You got Elijah
and Miguel. Where are we?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.610
KRUMITZ: We've narrowed
it down to five states
and 78 cameras.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.112
RUSSELL:
That's still too many.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.613
Guys, our working theory
is that Python was taking

34:07.646 --> 34:09.548
his mother home
to scatter her ashes.

34:09.581 --> 34:10.482
Yeah, so eliminate everything

34:10.516 --> 34:13.185
not within an hour of Evansville
or Topton.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.254
RAMIREZ: Hey, guys,
that's 27 cameras.

34:15.287 --> 34:16.555
NELSON: 15 of those
are unsecured.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.490
I'm checking their feeds now.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.092
All of them clear.
Okay, that leaves 12,

34:20.126 --> 34:23.095
seven of which are north
of where Renetta was cremated.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.396
Okay, there are three
in Evansville,

34:24.430 --> 34:25.597
his mom's birth town.

34:25.631 --> 34:27.399
It's got to be one of those.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.101
We're close, but we need
an exact location.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.603
Okay, Python left
his mother's head at my house.

34:31.637 --> 34:34.473
He left the surge protector
in Tear Down.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.275
He left us
all the answers we need,

34:36.308 --> 34:37.576
so that later,
we could look back

34:37.609 --> 34:38.610
knowing that
we could've saved her.

34:38.644 --> 34:40.512
RAMIREZ: He's been giving us
clues from the start.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.749
Say a prayer and follow a star.

34:43.782 --> 34:44.550
I'm sure you'll find her.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.418
He already told us
where she is.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.120
Okay, follow a star.
It's that one.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.788
Nash is a star

34:49.821 --> 34:51.390
in the Sagittarius
constellation.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.759
His mother was born
at the Nash Medical Center.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.593
It's been abandoned.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.162
RYAN: In Evansville.
Dispatch medical.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.230
Elijah, what's your location?

34:58.264 --> 34:59.298
MUNDO: We're just outside
of Evansville.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.233
Okay, Grace is at

35:01.267 --> 35:02.868
403 Old Mills Road.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.670
Hurry!
She doesn't have much time.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.471
We'll get there.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.818
Miguel, it's either Python
or Grace.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.188
(inhales, exhales)

35:22.221 --> 35:23.589
Call it in.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.790
Let's go get Grace.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.392
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

35:33.199 --> 35:34.266
(tires screech)

35:42.674 --> 35:43.675
RYAN: Elijah, hurry!

35:49.448 --> 35:50.816
She's not breathing.
Hold her head.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.784
Go for it.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.486
Come on, Grace.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.787
(panting)

35:55.821 --> 35:57.256
She's not breathing, man.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.191
Come on, Grace!

36:03.695 --> 36:04.730
(Grace gasping)

36:05.931 --> 36:07.833
Breathe...

36:10.001 --> 36:11.303
I got you.

36:11.337 --> 36:12.671
You're all right.

36:12.704 --> 36:13.805
Whew!

36:13.839 --> 36:14.806
You're all right.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.775
Attagirl.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.544
(groans)

36:18.577 --> 36:19.978
(siren chirps)

36:20.011 --> 36:21.413
AGENT: Is that
field officer here?

36:21.447 --> 36:22.748
RYAN:
Shh, don't talk.

36:22.781 --> 36:23.749
Don't talk.
It's okay. It's okay.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.384
I just,
I need to tell you.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.553
No, I wanted to quit.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.688
But you wouldn't let me.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.723
I wouldn't be here without you.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.261
Thank you.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.528
Oh, shh-shh, shh-shh.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.529
RENEE:
Grace.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.597
Mom?

36:38.630 --> 36:40.766
Oh, sweetheart. Oh.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.668
(crying):
Mom...

36:42.701 --> 36:44.236
(sighs)

36:47.339 --> 36:49.308
Oh...

36:49.341 --> 36:50.876
Mom...

36:50.909 --> 36:51.877
Avery's here.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.713
You should go talk to her.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.426
Thank you.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.827
There's no need to thank me.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.362
Avery, please.

37:10.396 --> 37:11.663
I wanted to call.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.265
I've rehearsed a thousand times
what I'd say,

37:13.299 --> 37:14.566
if I ever had the chance.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.567
(sighs)

37:15.601 --> 37:17.536
The day of the accident,

37:17.569 --> 37:19.471
Hannah was so happy.

37:19.505 --> 37:22.308
She was humming a little song
in the backseat of the car,

37:22.341 --> 37:23.975
and...

37:24.009 --> 37:27.446
I remember I sneezed.

37:27.479 --> 37:31.350
And in her tiny, little,
happy voice,

37:31.383 --> 37:33.452
she said,

37:33.485 --> 37:34.586
"Bless you."

37:34.620 --> 37:36.388
Those were her last words.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.589
"Bless you."

37:37.623 --> 37:39.458
And I have thought about that

37:39.491 --> 37:41.527
every day since.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.595
(sobbing)

37:44.963 --> 37:46.598
(sighs)

37:51.637 --> 37:53.772
Thank you for saving
my daughter's life.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.474
WOMAN:
That's my car!

37:55.507 --> 37:57.509
(indistinct radio
communication)

38:01.847 --> 38:03.682
(chuckles)

38:06.652 --> 38:09.621
Look, if you're ever
in Barcelona, call me.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.089
Okay?

38:11.122 --> 38:12.791
We'll have a hell of a time.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.026
This mean you're going
back to Interpol?

38:15.060 --> 38:16.595
No, not yet.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.863
I have a promise to keep.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.731
Miguel...

38:19.765 --> 38:21.633
Python is long gone.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.969
He abandoned his car--
he's not gonna be found
till he wants to be.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.004
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop looking, right?

38:26.037 --> 38:27.072
Then don't.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.407
Rejoin Interpol.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.608
Become the liaison to Cyber.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.976
We can find Python together.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.645
What do you think about that?

38:33.679 --> 38:35.046
I think you should do it.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.950
On this one, I'll work alone.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.052
Hmm?

38:43.054 --> 38:44.790
Hey.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.858
Miguel.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.126
Be careful.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.828
Next time

38:49.861 --> 38:50.996
I catch you breaking the law,

38:51.029 --> 38:52.330
I'll take you down myself.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.714
MAN: Hey, grab that box.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.817
Okay, we have one hour
to get CTOC back online.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.721
Every charger, every cable,
every surge protector must go.

39:15.754 --> 39:16.922
Take nothing for granted.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.525
Looks like Krummy
got his groove back.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.860
My groove is the one thing
I never lose.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.695
Call that clutch.

39:23.729 --> 39:24.696
You really think I'm clutch?

39:24.730 --> 39:27.032
Like Magic-playing-center-
to-beat-Boston clutch?

39:27.065 --> 39:29.901
Or Kobe-scoring-81-points-
in-a-single-game clutch?

39:29.935 --> 39:31.036
RAMIREZ:
No way.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.804
It was Jordan-dropping-
the-game-winner-

39:32.838 --> 39:34.039
against-the-Jazz-
in-game-six clutch.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.741
Huh?

39:35.774 --> 39:36.742
BOTH:
Now that's clutch.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.577
(chuckles) Wow.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.783
Okay, so this place
has been swept.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.918
There's a detail stationed
right outside.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.554
You need anything,
you call me, all right?

39:48.587 --> 39:49.555
And I'll be here.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.723
Aye-aye, sir.

39:51.757 --> 39:52.924
(chuckles)

39:52.958 --> 39:54.793
Man, what a day.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.094
It wasn't boring,
that's for sure.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.729
Yeah, actually, I could...

39:57.763 --> 39:59.097
use a little boring right now.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.600
I'm gonna come back tomorrow,
if you'd like,

40:01.633 --> 40:03.702
and I'm gonna help you get this
place into shape,

40:03.735 --> 40:06.738
all right? I'll even make
some of my famous lasagna.

40:06.772 --> 40:07.773
Oh, hey,

40:07.806 --> 40:08.707
Ooh.
it's a date.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.741
(laughs)

40:09.775 --> 40:11.710
Yeah.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.745
Thanks.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.582
(door opens)

40:16.615 --> 40:18.049
(door closes)

40:18.083 --> 40:20.151
(lock clicks)

40:20.185 --> 40:21.853
(sighs)

40:27.859 --> 40:30.161
(sighs)

40:30.195 --> 40:31.797
(groans)

40:46.845 --> 40:47.913
(sighs)

40:59.825 --> 41:01.527
(silenced gunshots,
Ryan gasps)

41:12.904 --> 41:14.940
(door creaking)

41:17.976 --> 41:19.778
(floorboard creaks)

41:21.146 --> 41:22.781
PYTHON:
Don't be afraid.

41:22.814 --> 41:23.782
I've waited an eternity
for this.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.883
It's over, Dante.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.718
Agents are gonna come storming
in here in a second.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.220
I believe they would,
if they weren't already dead.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.557
We're alone, Deputy Director,

41:31.590 --> 41:32.924
just you, me

41:32.958 --> 41:34.960
and Mother.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.697
I wanted her here to see this.

41:38.730 --> 41:39.665
Drop your gun, Dante!

41:39.698 --> 41:41.600
It doesn't have to end
like this.
It does.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.202
This way, either you die,

41:44.235 --> 41:45.771
or I haunt your dreams forever.

41:45.804 --> 41:46.805
(gunshots)

41:49.708 --> 41:50.709
(sighs, gasps)

41:58.650 --> 41:59.651
(panting)
