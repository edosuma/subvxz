WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.033
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.033 --> 00:03.703
LYNETTE CONFRONTED

00:03.703 --> 00:05.005
TOM'S NEW GIRLFRIEND.

00:05.005 --> 00:05.776
YOU THINK MAYBE YOU
COULD STOP

00:05.776 --> 00:07.608
TRYING TO TAKE
MY HUSBAND AWAY FROM ME?

00:07.608 --> 00:09.610
YOU THINK I'M GONNA GIVE UP
ON HIM JUST BECAUSE

00:09.610 --> 00:11.212
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT
YOUR MARRIAGE IS OVER?

00:11.212 --> 00:13.684
HEY, MIKE!
 BEN FOUND OUT
ABOUT MIKE'S PAST...

00:13.684 --> 00:15.746
EX-CON?

00:15.746 --> 00:17.017
AND HIRED HIM.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.050
I CAN DEFINITELY USE YOU.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.392
BREE SHOWED GABY
THE THREATENING NOTE.

00:21.392 --> 00:22.753
I'M SORRY
TO BURDEN YOU WITH THIS--

00:22.753 --> 00:24.695
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
TELLME?

00:24.695 --> 00:26.057
AND THEN SHE DISCOVERED
THE LOCATION

00:26.057 --> 00:28.659
OF BEN'S NEW DEVELOPMENT.

00:28.659 --> 00:30.531
WE'RE DIGGING UP THE BODY?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.133
BEN'S BULLDOZERS START
TEARING UP THE WOODS

00:32.133 --> 00:33.364
TOMORROW MORNING.

00:33.364 --> 00:35.035
WHERE ARE CARLOS AND SUSAN?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.407
I DIDN'T WANNA
FREAK 'EM OUT.

00:36.407 --> 00:38.669
AND SUSAN HAS DONE NOTHING
 BUTFREAK OUT, SO IT'S JUST US.

00:38.669 --> 00:41.342
BUT WHEN THEY GOT THERE...
 (whispers) NO!

00:41.342 --> 00:44.675
THEY FOUND SOMEONE
HAD BEATEN THEM TO IT.

00:50.381 --> 00:52.553
(Mary Alice) NO MATTER
WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

00:52.553 --> 00:56.827
BREE VAN DE KAMP ALWAYS FOUND
A WAY TO STAY IN CONTROL.

00:59.530 --> 01:03.264
SHE CURBED HER IMPULSES.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.498
SHE ENFORCED
A STRICT DRESS CODE.

01:11.142 --> 01:15.476
SHE MAINTAINED
A STRONG MORAL CENTER.

01:15.476 --> 01:19.150
YES,
BREE WAS ALWAYS IN CONTROL,

01:19.150 --> 01:22.353
SO WHEN IT CAME
TO HANDLING A CRISIS...

01:22.353 --> 01:25.456
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

01:25.456 --> 01:29.760
IT MADE PERFECT SENSE THAT
SHE WAS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.262
YEAH. I MEAN,
I CAN'T BELIEVE

01:31.262 --> 01:32.393
THE WORST THING
THAT HAPPENED TONIGHT

01:32.393 --> 01:34.325
WASNOTGETTING TO MOVE
A DEAD BODY.

01:34.325 --> 01:36.797
LADIES, PLEASE,
I NEED TO HEAR MYSELF THINK.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.630
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT IF HE'S ALIVE?

01:39.630 --> 01:41.732
RIGHT, AND AFTER
A 2-MONTH DIRT NAP,

01:41.732 --> 01:43.304
HE CLAWED HIS WAY OUT.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.476
NO, SOMEONE MUST HAVE
DUG HIM OUT.

01:45.476 --> 01:47.808
BUT WHO?
WHAT IF IT WAS THE COPS?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.780
NO! I CAN'T GO TO JAIL!

01:49.780 --> 01:51.212
WHAT, AND WE CAN?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.743
YES! YOU'LL START A GANG.

01:52.743 --> 01:54.845
BREE WILL WORK IN THE KITCHEN.
I'M THE SMALLEST ONE.

01:54.845 --> 01:56.447
I AM SO ENDING UP
SOMEBODY'S BITCH!

01:56.447 --> 01:58.449
SHH!
IT WASN'T THE POLICE.

01:58.449 --> 02:00.791
THEY WOULD HAVE TREATED IT
LIKE A CRIME SCENE,

02:00.791 --> 02:03.894
AND THAT AWFUL YELLOW TAPE
WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE.

02:03.894 --> 02:07.298
OKAY, THEN.
THINK ABOUT THIS, BREE.

02:07.298 --> 02:10.330
WHAT IF IT'S SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS WHAT WE DID,

02:10.330 --> 02:11.862
AND IT MADE THEM SICK...

02:11.862 --> 02:13.604
(whispers) AND NOW
THEY'RE GOING TO TELL?

02:13.604 --> 02:14.865
WHY IS SHE TALKING LIKE THAT?

02:14.865 --> 02:16.607
GABY IS ENGAGING
IN WILD SPECULATION,

02:16.607 --> 02:18.509
WHICH ISN'T AT ALL
PRODUCTIVE.

02:20.211 --> 02:22.773
THERE HAS TO BE
A SIMPLE EXPLANATION.

02:22.773 --> 02:24.845
WE JUST NEED TO TAKE
A DEEP BREATH AND THINK,

02:24.845 --> 02:28.449
AND THE ANSWER WILL BE
RIGHT IN FRONT US.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.551
(all inhale deeply)

02:30.551 --> 02:32.853
(all exhale deeply)

02:35.786 --> 02:37.188
SUSAN.

02:37.188 --> 02:39.930
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.
OF COURSE!

02:39.930 --> 02:41.832
WHY WOULDSUSANMOVE THE BODY?

02:41.832 --> 02:43.194
BECAUSE SHE'S CUCKOO CRAZY.

02:43.194 --> 02:45.796
SHE'S BEEN FLIPPING OUT
EVER SINCE WE BURIED THE GUY.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.839
OKAY, THEN WHAT IF ITWASHER?
WHAT DO WEDO?

02:48.839 --> 02:50.601
WE MARCH OVER
AND WE ASK IF SHE DID IT,

02:50.601 --> 02:51.872
AND IF SHE DID,

02:51.872 --> 02:53.944
I KNOW AN EMPTY GRAVE
THAT'S GOING TO WASTE.

02:53.944 --> 02:55.406
BUT IF SHE DIDN'T,

02:55.406 --> 02:57.177
THEN WE JUST ADMITTED THAT WE
WENT TO THE WOODS WITHOUT HER.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.810
IMAGINE WHAT CUCKOO
WILL DO WITH THAT.

02:59.810 --> 03:03.414
CLEARLY, WE HAVE TO BE
DIPLOMATIC, CRAFTY.

03:03.414 --> 03:06.887
WE'LL ASK INDIRECT QUESTIONS,
SCAN HER HOUSE FOR CLUES.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.321
WE'LL GATHER INFORMATION
WITHOUT AROUSING SUSPICION.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.828
OKAY, BREE. WELL, SEEMS LIKE
YOU GOT A GOOD HANDLE ON THIS.

03:17.828 --> 03:20.931
DEFINITELY.
LET US KNOW HOW IT GOES.

03:21.872 --> 03:25.276
YES, WHEN IT CAME TO A CRISIS,

03:25.276 --> 03:28.479
EVERYONE WAS HAPPY TO HAVE
BREE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT...

03:28.479 --> 03:30.941
FINE. I'LL TALK TO SUSAN.

03:30.941 --> 03:35.986
EVEN IF BREE HERSELF WOULD HAVE
PREFERRED TO BE A PASSENGER.

03:47.558 --> 03:48.929
AS THE MOTHER OF FIVE,

03:48.929 --> 03:52.903
LYNETTE SCAVO WAS USED
TO UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS.

03:52.903 --> 03:54.365
(crunches)

03:54.365 --> 03:56.967
WHY ARE YOU EATING
SANTA'S COOKIES?

03:58.639 --> 04:01.241
(flushing)

04:01.241 --> 04:03.444
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY GOLDFISH?

04:06.917 --> 04:10.250
WHY WERE YOU AND DADDY MAKING
FUNNY NOISES LAST NIGHT?

04:11.852 --> 04:14.455
YES, AFTER FIVE CHILDREN,

04:14.455 --> 04:17.257
LYNETTE THOUGHT
SHE'D HEARD IT ALL,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.730
UNTIL THERE WAS ONE QUESTION...

04:19.730 --> 04:21.291
ARE DAD AND JANE
GONNA GET MARRIED?

04:21.291 --> 04:23.764
SHE NEVER SAW COMING.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.366
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

04:25.366 --> 04:26.897
I DON'T KNOW.

04:26.897 --> 04:30.541
THEY'RE SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME TOGETHER, AND...

04:30.541 --> 04:32.543
IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN SAY IT.

04:32.543 --> 04:34.575
THEY SEEM REALLY HAPPY.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.808
YOU TOLD HER TO SAY IT.

04:37.808 --> 04:40.050
HONEY, JUST BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE HAPPY

04:40.050 --> 04:41.612
AND SPEND TIME TOGETHER,

04:41.612 --> 04:42.783
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE GONNA GET MARRIED.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.487
I MEAN, YOUR AUNT RENEE AND I
SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.688
AND WE'RE NOT GETTING MARRIED

04:47.688 --> 04:49.590
TILL YOUR MOM MAKES
A LOT MORE MONEY.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.591
(both chuckle)

04:50.591 --> 04:52.663
(doorbell rings)
 I'LL GET IT.

04:52.663 --> 04:53.994
YEAH.
 (door opens)

04:53.994 --> 04:56.797
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
YOU ALL READY TO SEE "WICKED"?

04:56.797 --> 04:57.868
HELLO, LYNETTE.

04:57.868 --> 04:58.869
HELLO.
 (door closes)

04:58.869 --> 05:01.572
OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT YOUR HAIR.

05:01.572 --> 05:02.973
WE'RE TWINS.
 (giggles)

05:02.973 --> 05:05.906
YES, YOU ARE.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.808
PENNY, WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO DO THAT?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.310
JANE TAUGHT ME.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.081
OH, IT'S EASY.
I COULD TEACH YOU, TOO.

05:11.081 --> 05:14.084
OH, I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.
(clears throat)

05:14.084 --> 05:15.886
OKAY. UH, WE SHOULD GO.

05:15.886 --> 05:17.848
WE MIGHT NOT BE HOME
UNTIL 11:00.

05:17.848 --> 05:19.990
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT?
 IT'S MY FAULT.

05:19.990 --> 05:20.991
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
WITH THE WICKED WITCH,

05:20.991 --> 05:24.355
AND SHE INVITED US BACKSTAGE.
IS THAT OKAY?

05:24.355 --> 05:26.957
O-OH, MY GOD.

05:26.957 --> 05:28.058
CAN I, MOM?

05:28.058 --> 05:32.803
WHAT CAN I SAY? SINCE YOU
ASKED ME IN FRONT OF PENNY.

05:34.365 --> 05:35.636
(laughs)

05:35.636 --> 05:37.337
LET'S GO, ZUZU.
 YEAH.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.009
BYE.

05:39.009 --> 05:41.872
(door closes)

05:41.872 --> 05:44.975
"ZUZU"?

05:44.975 --> 05:48.118
(sighs) YEAH. SHE'S GOT
A CUTE NICKNAME FOR PENNY.

05:48.118 --> 05:52.523
I BET SHE'S GOT ONE
FOR YOU, TOO--"DOORMAT."

05:52.523 --> 05:53.854
WHAT?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.356
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
SHE STOLE YOUR HUSBAND,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.459
AND NOW YOU'RE LETTING HER
TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER, TOO?

05:58.459 --> 05:59.790
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

05:59.790 --> 06:02.062
I'M NOT GONNA DRAG PENNY
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

06:02.062 --> 06:06.066
WELL, APPARENTLY, JANE DOESN'T
PLAY BY THE SAME RULES.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.099
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO FIGHT DIRTY.

06:09.099 --> 06:11.041
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.603
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

06:12.603 --> 06:14.004
SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL
WITH THE WICKED WITCH,

06:14.004 --> 06:17.147
BUT YOU WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH ME.

06:19.410 --> 06:21.782
IT'S PORTFOLIO REVIEW TIME.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.585
THAT'S THE SPECIAL MOMENT
WHERE I TELL YOU ALL

06:24.585 --> 06:25.986
HOW YOU'RE LETTING ME DOWN.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.719
OKAY, UH, SPEAKING AS
A FORMER TEACHER--

06:28.719 --> 06:30.020
STILL PONTIFICATING.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.922
NOW SOME MIGHT SAY,

06:31.922 --> 06:33.393
"HE MUST THINK
PRETTY HIGHLY OF HIMSELF

06:33.393 --> 06:35.065
TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE
SO HARSHLY,"

06:35.065 --> 06:39.169
TO WHICH I SAY,
YEAH, HE DOES.

06:39.169 --> 06:40.571
(under breath)
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?

06:40.571 --> 06:42.433
I WOULD DIE FOR HIM.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.506
YEAH.
THAT'S A HEALTHY ATTITUDE.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.007
SO WHILE YOU'RE OPENING
YOUR PORTFOLIOS

06:47.007 --> 06:48.138
AND ARRANGING YOUR WORKS,

06:48.138 --> 06:50.881
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
I DO NOT WANNA SEE.

06:50.881 --> 06:52.042
BOWLS OF FRUIT.

06:55.646 --> 06:57.688
PORTRAITS OF CHILDREN.

06:57.688 --> 06:59.149
(paper clatters)

06:59.149 --> 07:00.651
FRIGID WINTER LANDSCAPES.

07:02.653 --> 07:03.854
LUSH SUMMER VISTAS.

07:05.896 --> 07:09.860
HOWEVER, I DO ENJOY
A NICE OCEAN SCENE...

07:09.860 --> 07:12.062
JUST SO IT'S NOT RUINED

07:12.062 --> 07:14.865
BY THE ADDITION
OF A SAD, LITTLE SAILBOAT.

07:14.865 --> 07:17.908
DID YOU LOOK
 INMYPORTFOLIO?

07:17.908 --> 07:20.140
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DID.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.613
I WANTED TO STEEL MYSELF
FOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

07:22.613 --> 07:25.916
OKAY, AGAIN,
AS A FORMER TEACHER,

07:25.916 --> 07:27.748
THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU MOTIVATE PEOPLE.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.179
APPARENTLY NOT.

07:29.179 --> 07:31.051
YOU HAVEN'T GROWN AN INCH
SINCE YOU STARTED MY CLASS.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.624
YOUR WORK'S THE SAME
AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN--

07:33.624 --> 07:36.186
TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT
BUT TOTALLY BORING.

07:36.186 --> 07:37.658
YOU NEVER SURPRISE ME.

07:39.930 --> 07:42.833
AMY, ON THE OTHER HAND,
IS NOTHING BUT SURPRISES.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.134
THANK YOU.

07:44.134 --> 07:45.235
DON'T TALK, DEAR.

07:45.235 --> 07:48.198
HER TECHNIQUE IS ATROCIOUS.

07:48.198 --> 07:51.101
CATS WITH CRAYONS COULD DRAW
MORE CONVINCINGLY,

07:51.101 --> 07:53.103
BUT WHAT SHE DOES IS REAL,

07:53.103 --> 07:54.575
AND IT BLEEDS.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.206
AND I LOVE IT.

07:59.249 --> 08:01.211
I WOULD FOLLOW HIM INTO HELL.

08:01.211 --> 08:05.055
(scoffs)
I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE.

08:05.055 --> 08:07.117
CELIA, GET BACK HERE!
GIVE ME THAT NOW!

08:07.117 --> 08:09.489
HEY, HEY, HEY,
ENOUGH WITH THE SCREAMING!

08:09.489 --> 08:12.022
COME ON. SIT DOWN. COME ON.

08:16.827 --> 08:19.730
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?
SPAGHETTI AND MEAT-SHAPES?

08:19.730 --> 08:22.502
WELL, THEY STARTED OFF AS BALLS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.834
IS DADDY EATING WITH US?

08:23.834 --> 08:25.005
NO, SWEETIE.
HE'S TAKING A NAP.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.680
CELIA!
USE A FORK, NOT THE DOLL.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.684
MOM, REMEMBER THAT CABIN
ON THE LAKE?

08:34.684 --> 08:36.746
CAN WE RENT IT AGAIN
FOR SPRING VACATION?

08:36.746 --> 08:39.750
SPRING? IT ISN'T EVEN
THANKSGIVING YET.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.592
I KNOW, BUT WE ALWAYS PLAN
OUR VACATIONS IN THE FALL.

08:42.592 --> 08:45.095
WELL...

08:45.095 --> 08:46.557
WHO KNOWS WHAT
WE'LL BE DOING THEN?

08:46.557 --> 08:49.259
LET'S... JUST WORRY ABOUT THAT
LATER, OKAY?

08:49.259 --> 08:51.261
(glass clatters)

08:51.261 --> 08:54.234
BUT WE KNOW WE WANNA GO THERE.
WHY CAN'T WE PLAN IT NOW?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.006
WILL YOU JUST STOP?!

08:57.768 --> 08:59.810
JUST EAT YOUR FOOD.

09:01.271 --> 09:02.573
AND WHAT AM I GONNA
TELL HER?

09:02.573 --> 09:04.044
"SORRY, SWEETIE.
WE CAN'T RENT THAT CABIN

09:04.044 --> 09:06.647
'CAUSE DADDY AND I
MIGHT BE IN JAIL BY SPRING."

09:06.647 --> 09:09.319
WILL YOU STOP?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO JAIL.

09:09.319 --> 09:10.851
YOU CAN'T PROMISE THAT,
CARLOS.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.024
IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS.
NOTHING'S HAPPENED. RELAX.

09:15.325 --> 09:17.287
WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM?

09:17.287 --> 09:19.990
I'M JUST SAYING, A COP COULD
SHOW UP AT THE DOOR ANY DAY

09:19.990 --> 09:21.732
AND DESTROY OUR FAMILY.

09:21.732 --> 09:24.294
AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS.

09:24.294 --> 09:27.567
SURE, WE DO. WE NAMED
A GUARDIAN WHEN WE DID OUR WILL.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.269
YEAH, SUSAN.
SHE'LL BE MY CELLMATE,

09:29.269 --> 09:30.871
AND WE'LL BE MAKING
LICENSE PLATES

09:30.871 --> 09:32.242
WITH BREE AND LYNETTE.

09:32.242 --> 09:34.304
AH, RIGHT.

09:34.304 --> 09:37.748
WELL, WE'LL JUST FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.

09:37.748 --> 09:39.009
HOW ABOUT McCLUSKEY?

09:39.009 --> 09:40.310
ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:40.310 --> 09:41.852
I'VE GOT MEAT IN THE FREEZER
THAT'S GONNA BE AROUND

09:41.852 --> 09:43.854
LONGER THAN SHE IS.

09:43.854 --> 09:45.215
(sighs)

09:45.215 --> 09:48.088
(gasps) OH, I KNOW.
I KNOW, AND THEY'RE PERFECT.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.320
BOB AND LEE.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.591
HUH?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.763
NO, THINK ABOUT IT.

09:52.763 --> 09:55.766
TWO GAY GUYS WHO COULD HAVE
BEEN OUT DANCING EVERY NIGHT,

09:55.766 --> 09:57.167
ADOPTED A CHILD?

09:57.167 --> 09:58.799
THEYCHOSETHIS?

09:58.799 --> 10:01.301
YEAH, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?
THEY'RE UNSTABLE.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.334
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
THEY'RE GREAT PARENTS.

10:04.334 --> 10:06.076
YEAH, THEY ARE.

10:07.277 --> 10:10.981
OKAY. BOB AND LEE.
WE'LL ASK 'EM. (kisses)

10:10.981 --> 10:14.745
BUT DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

10:16.887 --> 10:19.349
(under breath)
CAN'T PROMISE THAT.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.331
DAD AND JANE ARE COMING.
I'M GONNA WAIT ON THE PORCH.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.402
(sighs)

10:32.402 --> 10:35.005
OH, AND JANE'S COOKING,
SO I WON'T NEED DINNER.

10:35.005 --> 10:37.307
(sighs deeply)

10:41.672 --> 10:43.944
EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.015
HUH?

10:45.015 --> 10:46.747
I'M SORRY.
I WAS JUST LOOKING

10:46.747 --> 10:49.720
AT ALL THESE PICTURES
IN YOUR BABY BOOK.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.182
I GUESS I WAS GETTING
A LITTLE NOSTALGIC.

10:52.182 --> 10:55.956
MOM, MY BABY BOOK HAS,
LIKE, FIVE PICTURES IN IT.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.089
BUT THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.
YOU WANNA SEE? LOOK.

10:59.089 --> 11:02.362
HERE'S YOU WITH ME AND YOUR DAD
AT YOUR 1st BIRTHDAY.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.064
LOOK AT US.

11:04.064 --> 11:08.699
WE WERE REALLY
A FAMILY THEN.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.341
WE'RE A FAMILY NOW.

11:11.341 --> 11:12.402
AREN'T WE?

11:12.402 --> 11:14.805
OF COURSE.
OH, OF COURSE.

11:14.805 --> 11:17.447
IT'S JUST...

11:18.448 --> 11:19.710
JUST WHAT?

11:19.710 --> 11:21.982
WELL, SINCE YOU ASKED,

11:21.982 --> 11:23.383
THINGS ARE
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

11:23.383 --> 11:25.455
SINCE YOUR DAD BROUGHT JANE
INTO THE PICTURE.

11:27.317 --> 11:28.859
YOU DON'T LIKE HER, DO YOU?

11:28.859 --> 11:32.222
OH, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
SHE'S A VERY SMART LADY,

11:32.222 --> 11:35.125
AND SHE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS
HOW TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS--

11:35.125 --> 11:38.268
MEDICAL CAREER,
OTHER PEOPLE'S HUSBANDS.

11:38.268 --> 11:39.299
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SAY
ANYTHING BAD.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.972
I KNOW. YOU LIKE HER.

11:41.972 --> 11:44.704
WELL... I THOUGHT SHE WAS NICE.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.237
SHEIS...TO YOU.

11:47.237 --> 11:50.240
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE SHE'S
TRYING TO STEAL YOU, TOO.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.411
BUT LIKE I SAID,

11:51.411 --> 11:52.983
I DON'T WANNA SAY ANYTHING BAD.

11:52.983 --> 11:54.284
YOU SHOULD GO WAIT OUT
ON THE PORCH.

11:54.284 --> 11:56.716
YOU DON'T NEED TO SIT HERE
LISTENING TO MY...

11:56.716 --> 11:59.790
LEGITIMATE WHINING.

11:59.790 --> 12:02.452
I DON'T WANNA GO OVER THERE.

12:02.452 --> 12:03.824
(thud)

12:03.824 --> 12:05.055
OH?

12:05.055 --> 12:08.028
I WANNA STAY HERE...
WITH YOU.

12:08.028 --> 12:11.331
WELL, IF YOU FEEL STRONGLY
ABOUT IT,

12:11.331 --> 12:12.462
AND I CAN TELL YOU DO,

12:12.462 --> 12:15.435
I COULD CALL YOUR DAD
AND MAKE AN EXCUSE.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.807
WOULD YOU?

12:16.807 --> 12:19.309
SWEETIE, I WOULD DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

12:19.309 --> 12:21.471
YOU AREMYDAUGHTER--

12:21.471 --> 12:24.374
MYBIOLOGICALDAUGHTER.

12:24.374 --> 12:27.477
THANKS. I LOVE YOU, MOM.

12:27.477 --> 12:30.420
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BOBO.

12:32.282 --> 12:33.453
"BOBO"?

12:35.225 --> 12:37.327
WE'LL WORK ON IT.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.761
UGH! I HATE YOU, ANDRE!

12:41.761 --> 12:44.034
(groans)

12:44.034 --> 12:45.365
SUSAN.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.297
I RANG YOUR DOORBELL TWICE.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

12:47.297 --> 12:51.041
OH, I CAN'T GET HIS VOICE
OUT OF MY HEAD.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.073
VOICE?

12:53.073 --> 12:56.106
YEAH. HE KEEPS TELLING ME
HOW BAD I AM.

12:56.106 --> 12:57.978
OH, REALLY?

12:57.978 --> 13:01.411
UH, DOES THIS VOICE ALSO
TELL YOU TO DO THINGS?

13:01.411 --> 13:03.353
SORRY.
I KNOW I MUST SOUND CRAZY.

13:03.353 --> 13:08.318
IT'S JUST, I'VE BEEN STARING AT
THIS BLANK CANVAS FOR TWO DAYS.

13:08.318 --> 13:10.490
I DON'T SLEEP. I DON'T EAT.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.192
DO YOU DIG THINGS UP?

13:12.192 --> 13:14.324
WHAT?
 WHAT?

13:14.324 --> 13:17.427
DID YOU JUST ASK ME
IF I DUG SOMETHING UP?

13:17.427 --> 13:18.999
OH! I THINK SOMEONE'S BEEN

13:18.999 --> 13:22.002
STARING AT A BLANK CANVAS
TOO LONG.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.074
BREE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:24.074 --> 13:25.375
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

13:25.375 --> 13:29.179
(sighs)

13:29.179 --> 13:31.381
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA COME
RIGHT OUT AND ASK YOU.

13:31.381 --> 13:33.343
DID YOU...
 HEY.

13:33.343 --> 13:35.115
MIKE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME?

13:35.115 --> 13:37.447
I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MEETING BEN ABOUT THE JOB.

13:37.447 --> 13:40.090
YEAH, I WAS, AND THEN HE CALLED
AND SAID HE HAD TO CANCEL.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.521
SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT THE SITE,

13:41.521 --> 13:43.523
AND THEY HAD TO SHUT DOWN
THE WHOLE PROJECT.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.925
THAT'S WEIRD.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.957
Y-YEAH.
DID HE SAY WHAT IT WAS?

13:46.957 --> 13:48.328
(sighs) NO.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.530
BUT HE SURE
DIDN'T SOUND GOOD.

13:54.204 --> 13:57.067
WELL, I REALLY
SHOULD BE GOING.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.240
WAIT. YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA ASK ME SOMETHING.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.511
NO, I DIDN'T.

14:01.511 --> 14:05.545
YOUREALLYNEED TO GET AWAY
FROM THOSE PAINT FUMES.

14:07.918 --> 14:10.450
(clatter)

14:10.450 --> 14:11.621
GUARDIANS?

14:11.621 --> 14:13.053
(chuckles)
 YEAH!

14:13.053 --> 14:14.584
YOU KNOW, IN CASE
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO US,

14:14.584 --> 14:17.988
WE THINK YOU GUYS WOULD BE
TERRIFIC PARENTS TO OUR GIRLS.

14:17.988 --> 14:19.329
WOW.

14:19.329 --> 14:20.931
WHAT AN HONOR.

14:20.931 --> 14:24.534
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE LOVE JUANITA AND...

14:24.534 --> 14:26.596
THE OTHER ONE.
 CELIA.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.238
TIP OF MY TONGUE.

14:28.238 --> 14:30.370
BUT YOU HAVE SO MANY
CLOSER FRIENDS ON THE LANE.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.972
WHAT ABOUT SUSAN?

14:31.972 --> 14:33.443
YEAH, THAT'D NEVER WORK.

14:33.443 --> 14:34.905
(chuckles)
 WHY NOT?

14:34.905 --> 14:37.407
UM, WELL, SUSAN...

14:37.407 --> 14:38.408
IS...

14:38.408 --> 14:40.450
A RACIST.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.312
WHAT? I-I'VE KNOWN HER
FOR YEARS.

14:42.312 --> 14:44.514
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
BE RACIST.

14:44.514 --> 14:46.316
IT'S NEW.
 (whispers) YEAH.

14:46.316 --> 14:48.588
WHAT ABOUT BREE?

14:48.588 --> 14:51.962
YEAH! AN ALCOHOLIC WITH
A HOUSE FULL OF GUNS? GENIUS.

14:51.962 --> 14:55.025
LYNETTE? McCLUSKEY?
ANYONE AT ALL?

14:55.025 --> 14:57.597
HANG ON.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.669
YOU GUYS HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH OUR GIRLS?

14:59.669 --> 15:02.502
IT'S JUST, WE'RE STILL LEARNING
HOW TO TAKE CARE OFONEKID.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.136
YOU'VE GOT TWO,
AND THEY'RE BOTH...

15:06.136 --> 15:07.407
YOU KNOW.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.638
WHAT?

15:08.638 --> 15:11.011
MONSTERS. (sighs)

15:11.011 --> 15:13.343
YOU KNOW IT. WE KNOW IT.
WHY ARE WE DANCING AROUND IT?

15:13.343 --> 15:15.545
I WAS GONNA SAY "SPIRITED."

15:15.545 --> 15:17.587
NO, NO, NO, NO. (chuckles)
SEE, THEY USED TO BE LIKE THAT.

15:17.587 --> 15:19.950
THEY'VE CHANGED.
THEY'RE ALL GROWN UP NOW.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.321
I BABYSAT THEM
TWO MONTHS AGO.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.194
JUANITA PUNCHED ME IN THE NECK,
AND THE OTHER ONE BIT ME.

15:24.194 --> 15:26.096
(clenches teeth)
CELIA. HER NAME IS CELIA.

15:26.096 --> 15:27.227
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
SERIOUSLY, GUYS,

15:27.227 --> 15:28.558
THEY'RE LIKE
DIFFERENT PEOPLE NOW.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.961
SO WELL-BEHAVED.

15:30.961 --> 15:34.604
YEAH. Y-YOU HAVE TO SEE IT
TO BELIEVE IT.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.136
(chuckles nervously)

15:36.136 --> 15:39.239
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.570
WHAT? WHAT IS?

15:40.570 --> 15:43.943
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE US OVER
FOR DINNER TOMORROW?

15:43.943 --> 15:47.947
AND WE CAN SEE HOW
WELL-BEHAVED THEY TRULY ARE.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.620
OH, MY GOD!

15:50.620 --> 15:53.553
THATISA GREAT IDEA.
(chuckles)

15:53.553 --> 15:56.556
BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW,
BECAUSE THE GIRLS...

15:56.556 --> 15:59.589
ARE BUSY
WITH THEIR BIBLE PAGEANT,

15:59.589 --> 16:02.532
AND THEIR EXTENSIVE
CHARITY WORK.

16:02.532 --> 16:04.194
TOMORROW.

16:04.194 --> 16:06.496
TOMORROW.

16:06.496 --> 16:09.539
BYE, GUYS.
 SEE YOU AT DINNER.

16:09.539 --> 16:11.441
(under breath) WE'RE DEAD.
 YEAH.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.378
OKAY, BOB AND LEE

16:18.378 --> 16:19.649
ARE COMING OVER FOR DINNER
TONIGHT.

16:19.649 --> 16:21.451
THAT GIVES ME NINE HOURS
TO TEACH YOU

16:21.451 --> 16:24.384
TO BE COURTEOUS, GRACIOUS,
AND WELL-MANNERED--

16:24.384 --> 16:27.587
EXACT OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU USUALLY ARE.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.760
THISIS WHY YOU KEPT US
HOME FROM SCHOOL?

16:30.760 --> 16:34.424
OH, YOU'RE IN SCHOOL,
AND CLASS IS IN SESSION.

16:34.424 --> 16:37.697
OKAY, NOW WHICH ONE
IS THE SALAD FORK?

16:37.697 --> 16:40.200
WHAT'S SALAD?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.701
(sighs)

16:43.703 --> 16:46.536
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU BRUSHED YOUR...

16:46.536 --> 16:48.578
(brush bristles crackle)

16:48.578 --> 16:51.681
IS THIS A LOLLIPOP?!

16:51.681 --> 16:54.514
TOLD YOU IT WASN'T
A GOOD HIDING PLACE.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.417
COME ON. THINK!

16:57.417 --> 17:01.151
WHO WON THE TONY
FOR BEST MUSICAL IN 1995?

17:01.151 --> 17:04.624
THIS IS TOO HARD. WHY CAN'T
GAY PEOPLE LIKE CARTOONS?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.056
(sighs)

17:06.056 --> 17:08.397
DID YOU GET THAT
OUT OF THE GARBAGE?

17:13.463 --> 17:16.566
HEY. DIDN'T YOU GET
MY MESSAGE?

17:16.566 --> 17:19.169
ABOUT PENNY NOT BEING ABLE
TO COME OVER? YEAH.

17:19.169 --> 17:21.040
(chuckles) BEEN GETTING A LOT
OF THOSE MESSAGES LATELY.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.112
PENNY?!

17:22.112 --> 17:23.443
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?

17:23.443 --> 17:24.574
TO SEE MY DAUGHTER.

17:26.076 --> 17:28.578
I WANNA FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

17:28.578 --> 17:31.181
HEY!

17:31.181 --> 17:32.422
HEY, DAD.

17:32.422 --> 17:34.424
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU THIS WEEK.

17:34.424 --> 17:36.256
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.428
YEAH. I'VE JUST HAD
A LOT OF HOMEWORK AND STUFF.

17:38.428 --> 17:40.230
WHY DON'T YOU DO IT
AT MY PLACE?

17:41.461 --> 17:42.732
YOU KNOW, IF IT--
IF IT'S SCIENCE,

17:42.732 --> 17:46.666
JANE LIVES RIGHT UPSTAIRS,
AND SHE'S A REAL BRAINIAC.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.667
NO, THANKS.

17:49.299 --> 17:50.540
I'D RATHER HAVE MOM HELP.

17:58.548 --> 18:00.580
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH JANE, SWEETIE?

18:05.655 --> 18:07.687
I'VE GOT A REALLY BIG TEST
TOMORROW, SO I SHOULD--

18:07.687 --> 18:10.520
HANG ON.HANGON.

18:10.520 --> 18:15.595
MAY-MAYBE YOU AND I NEED
A LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE TIME.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.496
YOU--YOU REMEMBER THAT PARK

18:16.496 --> 18:17.797
WHERE I TAUGHT YOU
TO PLAY CATCH?

18:19.469 --> 18:23.503
WELL, I'M GONNA BE THERE
TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL--JUST ME.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.206
WE CAN HANG OUT OR--
OR DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.707
(kisses) WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.180
OKAY.

18:36.486 --> 18:39.489
HUH. THAT'S WEIRD.

18:39.489 --> 18:41.521
PENNY AND JANE WERE
GETTING ALONG GREAT,

18:41.521 --> 18:43.523
AND THEN, UH,
ALL OF A SUDDEN--

18:43.523 --> 18:44.594
ALL OF A SUDDEN WHAT?

18:44.594 --> 18:46.626
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING TO HER
ABOUT NOT LIKING JANE?

18:46.626 --> 18:49.259
PENNY'S A BIG GIRL.
SHE HAS HER OWN OPINIONS.

18:51.661 --> 18:52.902
OKAY.

18:52.902 --> 18:54.634
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT WE REMEMBER

18:54.634 --> 18:58.568
THAT THIS THING BETWEEN US
IS BETWEEN US, NOT THE KIDS.

18:58.568 --> 19:00.410
HEY, DON'T BLAME ME.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.172
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO JUMPED
INTO A RELATIONSHIP

19:02.172 --> 19:03.673
WITHOUT THINKING
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES.

19:03.673 --> 19:06.616
YOU MADE YOUR BED...
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

19:06.616 --> 19:08.778
I'M GONNA GO HELP OUR DAUGHTER
WITH HER HOMEWORK.

19:17.927 --> 19:19.929
(gears shift, engine turns off)

19:24.634 --> 19:25.765
BREE?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.768
(sighs) HELLO.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.771
I WANTED TO CELEBRATE
YOUR FIRST DAY OF CONSTRUCTION

19:31.771 --> 19:33.243
WITH LUNCH.

19:33.243 --> 19:34.704
I'M ALREADY EATING.

19:36.306 --> 19:39.609
THERE WAS A LITTLE PROBLEM.

19:39.609 --> 19:43.583
REALLY? I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
ME NOSY IF I ASK--

19:43.583 --> 19:46.416
MY GUYS FOUND A BODY
BURIED IN THE WOODS.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.559
OH, MY.
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?

19:49.559 --> 19:51.591
NOT YET.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.495
(smacks lips)

19:55.495 --> 19:58.598
SO THEY FOUND A BODY. HOW?

19:58.598 --> 20:00.630
UH, DOING SOIL SAMPLES.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.772
UM, THEY DUG IT UP
HALLOWEEN NIGHT,

20:02.772 --> 20:04.734
PUT IT IN A STORAGE SHED.

20:04.734 --> 20:07.237
AND WHY HAVE YOU WAITED
SO LONG TO CALL THE POLICE?

20:07.237 --> 20:09.779
'CAUSE I KEEP HOPING
I'LL FIND A WAY OUT OF THIS.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.941
'CAUSE ONCE I CALL,

20:11.941 --> 20:13.783
MY PROJECT BECOMES
A CRIME SCENE.

20:13.783 --> 20:15.945
THEY SHUT IT DOWN.
I LOSE A LOT OF TIME,

20:15.945 --> 20:18.588
AND... A LOT OF MONEY.

20:18.588 --> 20:22.952
WHAT A SHAME.

20:22.952 --> 20:25.755
IT MUST BE SO TEMPTING
TO JUST...

20:25.755 --> 20:28.898
MAKE THE BODY DISAPPEAR.

20:28.898 --> 20:32.662
(scoffs) I'M SURE YOU'VE
CONSIDERED RE-BURYING IT

20:32.662 --> 20:35.805
OR DISSOLVING IT IN ACID
OR WRAPPING IT IN HEAVY CHAINS

20:35.805 --> 20:38.538
AND DROPPING IT IN A LAKE.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.342
I'M SURE
YOU'VE CONSIDERED THAT.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.474
Y-YEAH, YEAH.
OF COURSE I HAVE.

20:44.474 --> 20:49.479
UH... BUT IF I HIDE THIS,
AND IT COMES OUT LATER,

20:49.479 --> 20:50.780
I'M COMMITTING A FELONY.

20:50.780 --> 20:53.022
AND I...

20:53.022 --> 20:54.784
I CAN'T TAKE THAT RISK.

20:54.784 --> 20:55.885
I KNOW, BUT THINK

20:55.885 --> 20:57.687
OF ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO'LL LOSE THEIR JOBS,

20:57.687 --> 20:59.359
AND--AND WHAT ABOUT THE--

20:59.359 --> 21:00.960
THE POOR MEN
WHO DUG UP THE BODY?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.792
THEY--THEY COULD FACE
CHARGES.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.494
I KNOW THAT, BREE.

21:06.996 --> 21:08.568
(sighs)

21:08.568 --> 21:11.270
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE JUST
SAYING THE SAME STUFF

21:11.270 --> 21:13.673
I'VE BEEN THINKING ALL DAY.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.274
(exhales deeply)

21:16.646 --> 21:19.008
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
OUT OF THIS.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.553
THERE ISN'T, IS THERE?

21:28.658 --> 21:30.520
I GOT TO GO CALL THE COPS,
GET THIS OVER WITH.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.691
(bottles clank)

21:33.663 --> 21:36.596
(sighing)

21:59.349 --> 22:00.650
BREE?

22:14.604 --> 22:16.866
HE WAS A HORRIBLE MAN.

22:16.866 --> 22:20.039
WH-WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHO THIS WAS?

22:20.039 --> 22:22.041
HE HURT A CHILD...

22:23.613 --> 22:26.876
SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT
VERY MUCH,

22:26.876 --> 22:29.018
AND HE WAS GONNA HURT HER
AGAIN.

22:36.786 --> 22:38.357
BREE, DID YOU KILL HIM?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.392
WELL, TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.

22:42.392 --> 22:44.694
I NEED TO KNOW
BEFORE I GO TO THE POLICE.

22:44.694 --> 22:47.597
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

22:47.597 --> 22:49.739
MY FRIEND DID,
AND I HELPED BURY HIM HERE.

22:49.739 --> 22:52.402
OH, GOD.

22:54.404 --> 22:58.007
AND YOU WANT ME TO--
TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

22:58.007 --> 23:00.980
I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.912
BUT YES.

23:02.912 --> 23:05.415
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.896
WELL, I'M SORRY, BREE.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.668
I CAN'T.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.705
(crying)

23:34.013 --> 23:35.785
AND THANK YOU, LORD,
FOR THIS WONDERFUL FOOD.

23:35.785 --> 23:37.917
AND BLESS OUR GOOD FRIENDS,
BOB AND LEE.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.550
WE ARE SO GRATEFUL
TO HAVE THEM AS OUR NEIGHBORS.

23:43.052 --> 23:45.795
AND BLESS THEIR DAUGHTER JENNY
WHO IS AWAY AT HER SLEEPOVER.

23:45.795 --> 23:48.027
WE MISS HER SO MUCH.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.500
AND BLESS ALL THE CHILDREN
OF THE WORLD

23:50.500 --> 23:52.502
WHETHER THEY HAVE
A MOMMY AND DADDY,

23:52.502 --> 23:54.734
TWO MOMMIES,

23:54.734 --> 23:57.136
OR TWO DADDIES.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.067
AMEN.

23:58.067 --> 23:59.969
(all) AMEN.

23:59.969 --> 24:02.872
THAT WAS REALLY NICE. WE NEVER
PRAY BEFORE MEALS AT OUR HOUSE.

24:02.872 --> 24:06.145
WELL, SOME MEALS YOU JUST
NEED TO PRAY BEFORE.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.147
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DRESS,
JUANITA.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.719
I GUESS.

24:09.719 --> 24:12.982
(singsongy) OH, JUANITA.
DON'T BE MODEST.

24:12.982 --> 24:14.724
(chuckles) OH.

24:14.724 --> 24:17.887
ISN'T THERE A STORY BEHIND
THAT DRESS YOU'D LIKE TO TELL?

24:17.887 --> 24:20.459
WELL, ACTUALLY,

24:20.459 --> 24:23.232
IT'S KIND OF LIKE ANITA'S DRESS
IN "WEST SIDE STORY,"

24:23.232 --> 24:25.695
MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MUSICAL.

24:25.695 --> 24:29.238
(gasps) YOU LIKE MUSICALS?

24:29.238 --> 24:32.672
HMM. DO I LIKE MUSICALS?

24:32.672 --> 24:35.705
(laughs) OF COURSE YOU DO,
SILLY. YOU LOVE THEM!

24:35.705 --> 24:37.747
(laughs) OH.

24:37.747 --> 24:39.178
OOH.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.880
(lowered voice) ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO OWE YOU.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.512
I'M OUT OF SINGLES.
 (lowered voice)
I CAN BREAK A $5.

24:42.512 --> 24:45.785
(normal voice) SUCH A GOOD GIRL.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.256
SHE SURE IS.

24:47.256 --> 24:49.488
ANYONE NEED SALT?

24:49.488 --> 24:50.620
NO.

24:57.266 --> 24:58.628
OH, GOD.

24:58.628 --> 25:00.129
YOU BROKE ME.

25:00.129 --> 25:03.502
AND NOW YOU'RE INSIDE.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.104
I CAN'T PAINT.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.807
I JUST STARE
AT THE EMPTY CANVAS

25:07.807 --> 25:11.140
AND WONDER HOW MUCH YOU'RE
GONNA HATE WHAT I DO NEXT.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.212
OH, I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.213
YOU CAN?

25:14.213 --> 25:17.687
YES. I'LL HATE IT A LOT.
WE GOOD?

25:17.687 --> 25:21.150
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET YOU
TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY?

25:21.150 --> 25:24.223
HEY.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.125
OH.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.127
O-OF COURSE.

25:28.127 --> 25:31.000
IT MAKES PERFECT...

25:31.000 --> 25:34.163
THIS IS WHY YOU LIKE AMY
BETTER IN CLASS.

25:34.163 --> 25:37.136
NO, I LIKE AMY BETTER IN CLASS
BECAUSE SHE'S A BETTER ARTIST.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.740
THIS IS WHY I LIKE HER IN BED.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.741
SEE YA.

25:43.072 --> 25:44.714
SO AS YOU CAN SEE, SUSAN,
I'M A LITTLE BUSY,

25:44.714 --> 25:46.015
SO IF WE'RE DONE...

25:46.015 --> 25:47.817
WE'RE NOT DONE. (scoffs)

25:47.817 --> 25:50.249
I AM TOTALLY ADRIFT
IN THAT CLASS.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.851
OKAY.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.953
WOULD IT HELP IF I TOLD YOU
WHAT YOUR GRADE IS?

25:53.953 --> 25:57.827
NO. I-I-I--I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS--

25:57.827 --> 25:59.889
YOU'RE GETTING AN "A."
 REALLY?

25:59.889 --> 26:01.691
WELL, ACTUALLY, AN "A"-PLUS.

26:01.691 --> 26:03.793
OH, WAIT. I'M SURE
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU.

26:03.793 --> 26:07.336
YOU PROBABLY ALSO NEED TO KNOW
EVERYBODY ELSE WILL GET A "D."

26:07.336 --> 26:09.068
AMY, YOU'RE GETTING A "D."

26:09.068 --> 26:10.600
(Amy) OKAY!

26:10.600 --> 26:13.873
CONGRATULATIONS, SUSAN.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.606
I DO NOT WANT YOU TO GIVE ME
A FAKE GRADE.

26:16.606 --> 26:19.108
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
IF YOU'RE LYING.

26:19.108 --> 26:21.250
WELL, WHY NOT?

26:21.250 --> 26:23.352
YOU'RE LYING.

26:23.352 --> 26:25.184
NO, I'M NOT.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.957
EVERY TIME YOU SIT DOWN
TO PAINT

26:27.957 --> 26:30.620
AND DON'T PAINT THE FEAR
AND PAIN THAT'S IN YOU,

26:30.620 --> 26:31.621
YOU'RE LYING.

26:31.621 --> 26:33.292
EVERY TIME YOU CARE

26:33.292 --> 26:36.195
WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE THINKS
ABOUT YOUR ART, YOU'RE LYING.

26:37.627 --> 26:39.098
UH, I HAVE TO GO.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.201
I USED TO THINK YOU WERE
HOLDING SOMETHING BACK,

26:42.201 --> 26:45.975
AND NOW I WONDER IF THERE
JUST ISN'T ANYTHING THERE.

26:45.975 --> 26:48.708
SO ENJOY YOUR "A"-PLUS,

26:48.708 --> 26:51.911
BUT DON'T COME TO MY CLASS
ANYMORE. WE'RE DONE.

26:55.084 --> 26:57.787
(laughs)

26:57.787 --> 26:59.018
GABY, IT WAS
A WONDERFUL NIGHT.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.619
AND YOU WERE SO RIGHT
ABOUT THE GIRLS.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.992
THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT.

27:02.992 --> 27:04.223
WHEN THEY SANG
THE "DREAMGIRLS" NUMBER--

27:04.223 --> 27:06.055
GOOSE BUMPS, SERIOUSLY.

27:06.055 --> 27:08.227
AW, I'M JUST GLAD
YOU COULD COME.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.130
YOU GUYS ARE SO SPECIAL
TO US.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.262
GABY, DID YOU LEAVE
THE GARAGE DOOR OPEN?

27:13.262 --> 27:15.304
OH, I MEAN,
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY FAMILY.

27:15.304 --> 27:17.336
(chuckles) THAT'S WHY
WHEN WE WERE THINKING

27:17.336 --> 27:21.340
WHO WE'D WANT TO BE GUARDIANS
OF OUR PRECIOUS ANGELS,

27:21.340 --> 27:24.413
YOU TWO WERE THE ONLY ONES
WE CONSIDERED.

27:24.413 --> 27:28.247
I MEAN, THE GIRLS ABSOLUTELY
ADORE YOU, AND...

27:29.819 --> 27:30.980
WHAT?

27:36.285 --> 27:38.227
OH, DEAR.

27:38.227 --> 27:43.162
THIS ASIDE, IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD
EVENING, WASN'T IT?

27:51.801 --> 27:53.272
(scoffs)

27:55.674 --> 27:58.177
(sighs)

27:58.177 --> 28:01.010
I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

28:01.010 --> 28:03.382
YOUR FATHER AND I
DID NOT RAISE YOU LIKE THIS.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.354
SORRY.

28:05.354 --> 28:07.316
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME WHY?
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND.

28:07.316 --> 28:08.918
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
BOB AND LEE.

28:08.918 --> 28:11.320
I DO. THEY'RE NICE.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.023
THEN I'M CONFUSED.
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

28:16.726 --> 28:21.070
FINE. GO TO BED. WE'LL TALK
ABOUT YOUR PUNISHMENT TOMORROW

28:21.070 --> 28:23.903
AND HOW YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
THIS UP TO THEM.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.235
IS DADDY DYING?

28:26.235 --> 28:29.178
WHAT?

28:29.178 --> 28:31.180
NO! WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
SAY THAT?

28:31.180 --> 28:35.114
BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
ACTING DIFFERENT,

28:35.114 --> 28:37.246
AND DADDY SLEEPS A LOT,

28:37.246 --> 28:40.449
AND... EVERYONE SEEMS SAD.

28:40.449 --> 28:43.292
EVEN WHEN WE'RE HAPPY,
IT'S LIKE...

28:43.292 --> 28:45.494
I DON'T KNOW. JUST SAD.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.401
DADDY'S FINE,

28:52.401 --> 28:55.004
AND MOMMY'S FINE, TOO.

28:55.004 --> 28:58.437
THEN WHY DO YOU WANT US
TO GO LIVE WITH BOB AND LEE?

28:59.969 --> 29:03.442
I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING
ABOUT IT. SORRY.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.914
OHH.

29:04.914 --> 29:07.146
HONEY, IT'S CALLED
BEING A GUARDIAN.

29:07.146 --> 29:10.820
EVERY FAMILY HAS THAT.
IT'S JUST IN CASE.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.122
BUT TRUST ME,
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.

29:15.454 --> 29:19.288
SO... WE CAN RENT THAT CABIN
FOR SPRING VACATION?

29:19.288 --> 29:20.960
SURE.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.893
AND EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY?

29:23.893 --> 29:25.034
YOU PROMISE?

29:25.034 --> 29:28.397
CROSS MY HEART.

29:33.342 --> 29:35.174
(sighs)

29:44.053 --> 29:47.386
OKAY, LAST WEEK IT WAS
A TEETHING BISCUIT

29:47.386 --> 29:49.788
CAKED TO MY ASS,
AND NOW THIS?
 (gears shift)

29:49.788 --> 29:53.192
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

29:53.192 --> 29:55.164
PENNY'S MEETING TOM HERE
FOR SOME ONE-ON-ONE TIME,

29:55.164 --> 29:56.495
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

29:56.495 --> 30:00.369
SAINTJANEDIDN'T MAKE IT
A THREESOME.

30:00.369 --> 30:04.003
THREESOME? LOOKS MORE LIKE
A LONESOME TO ME.

30:06.075 --> 30:07.476
SHE DIDN'T COME.

30:07.476 --> 30:10.809
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S BUSY.
YOU SAID JANE'S A DOCTOR, RIGHT?

30:10.809 --> 30:14.143
I WAS TALKING ABOUT PENNY.

30:15.444 --> 30:17.116
SHE DIDN'T COME.

30:18.888 --> 30:22.021
WELL... AT LEAST YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT JANE

30:22.021 --> 30:24.053
BUSTING UP YOUR FAMILY.

30:24.053 --> 30:26.355
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:26.355 --> 30:31.260
I SEEM TO BE DOING THAT
JUST FINE ON MY OWN.

30:32.561 --> 30:35.204
(sighs)

30:35.204 --> 30:36.305
HELLO, BREE.

30:36.305 --> 30:40.609
CHUCK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:40.609 --> 30:44.213
RELAX. JUST POLICE BUSINESS.

30:44.213 --> 30:47.346
FOLLOWING UP
ON A MISSING PERSON REPORT.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.847
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?

30:52.922 --> 30:54.623
TWO MONTHS AGO?

30:54.623 --> 30:56.555
THE NIGHT
OF THAT DINNER PARTY.

30:56.555 --> 31:00.359
WE WERE WALKING TO YOUR HOUSE,
AND WE PASSED HIM.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.632
RIGHT HERE. YOU REMEMBER?

31:03.632 --> 31:06.365
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MAN
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

31:06.365 --> 31:11.400
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF MICROEXPRESSIONS, BREE?

31:11.400 --> 31:13.342
THEY FLASH
ACROSS A PERSON'S FACE

31:13.342 --> 31:15.104
FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND,

31:15.104 --> 31:16.946
REVEALING THEIR TRUE EMOTION,

31:16.946 --> 31:19.248
INSTEAD OF THE ONE
THEY'RE COVERING WITH.

31:19.248 --> 31:21.450
IT'S HOW COPS KNOW
WHEN PEOPLE LIE.

31:21.450 --> 31:23.412
WELL, THAT'S ALL
VERY FASCINATING,

31:23.412 --> 31:25.114
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

31:25.114 --> 31:26.355
FOR EXAMPLE, UM,

31:26.355 --> 31:30.589
WHEN A PERSON IS DISTRESSED,
THEIR EYEBROWS GO UP,

31:30.589 --> 31:33.462
CAUSING LINES TO APPEAR
ACROSS THE FOREHEAD.

31:33.462 --> 31:36.295
(whispers) DON'T TOUCH ME.

31:36.295 --> 31:39.598
DO YOU KNOW,
THE FUNNY THING IS...

31:39.598 --> 31:43.232
I DON'T NEED A MICROEXPRESSION
TO TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE LYING.

31:43.232 --> 31:45.374
'CAUSE I KNOW THAT LOOK
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

31:45.374 --> 31:48.337
I SAW IT EVERY TIME
I WAS IN YOUR BED

31:48.337 --> 31:50.339
AND YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME.

31:50.339 --> 31:53.182
SO SINCE I KNOW YOU'RE LYING,

31:53.182 --> 31:56.015
WHY DON'T YOU START
TELLING ME THE TRUTH?

31:56.015 --> 31:57.386
(footsteps approach)
 (gasps)

31:57.386 --> 31:59.989
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.591
I'M A COP.

32:02.591 --> 32:04.693
I KNOW.
KEEP HARASSING THIS WOMAN,

32:04.693 --> 32:06.425
AND YOU'RE GONNA WIND UP
AN EX-COP.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.357
(scoffs)

32:08.357 --> 32:11.430
UM, YOU MIGHT WANT TO WATCH IT
WITH THE TOUGH GUY ACT, BUDDY.

32:11.430 --> 32:16.335
OH, UNLIKE YOU, OFFICER,
IT'S NOT AN ACT.

32:22.011 --> 32:23.212
I'LL BE SEEING YOU.

32:27.516 --> 32:30.079
BIG MISTAKE.

32:34.423 --> 32:36.325
(scoffs)

32:36.325 --> 32:38.727
WELL, HE'S A DELIGHT.

32:38.727 --> 32:40.629
(whispers)
OH, GOD. I'M SHAKING.

32:40.629 --> 32:43.192
(whispers) HEY, HEY, HEY.

32:46.195 --> 32:49.468
DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH, UH...

32:49.468 --> 32:51.300
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
IN THE WOODS?

32:51.300 --> 32:53.302
YES.

32:53.302 --> 32:56.145
THEN YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO BE SCARED ABOUT.

32:58.447 --> 33:02.181
WELL, IT'S PRETTY HARD
TO BUILD A CASE WITHOUT A BODY.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.415
(gasps and sighs)

33:08.187 --> 33:12.291
OH, MY. THANK YOU.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.263
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
FOR ME?

33:16.665 --> 33:19.598
AH, YOU NEVER KNOW.
MAYBE SOMEDAY...

33:19.598 --> 33:22.101
I MIGHT NEED SOMETHING
FROM YOU.

33:29.438 --> 33:31.180
(exhales deeply)

33:34.683 --> 33:36.585
(shifts gears,
takes keys out of ignition)

33:36.585 --> 33:38.417
WHAT ARE WE... WHAT?

33:38.417 --> 33:40.389
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO THE MALL.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.594
NO.
 SWEETIE, LISTEN--

33:45.594 --> 33:47.496
CAN WE GET OUTTA HERE?

33:47.496 --> 33:48.497
PLEASE?

33:48.497 --> 33:50.359
NO, WE CAN'T.

33:50.359 --> 33:52.431
YOU NEED TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH YOUR DAD.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.563
I DON'T WANT TO.

33:54.563 --> 34:00.269
I'M NOT GIVING YOU A CHOICE.
LOOK AT HIM. LOOK.

34:00.269 --> 34:02.471
YOU KNOW WHY
HE'S SITTING OVER THERE?

34:02.471 --> 34:05.374
BECAUSE HE MISSES YOU
SO MUCH.

34:05.374 --> 34:08.447
THEN HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
LEFT US FOR JANE.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.449
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

34:12.781 --> 34:17.456
HE DIDN'T LEAVE US.
HE LEFTME.

34:17.456 --> 34:21.130
AND HE DIDN'T DO IT FOR JANE.
HE DID IT BECAUSE...

34:23.462 --> 34:26.635
WE JUST DON'T MAKE
EACH OTHER HAPPY,

34:26.635 --> 34:30.369
AND THEN HE MET JANE,
AND I GUESS SHE DOES...

34:30.369 --> 34:34.543
MAKE HIM HAPPY, SO...

34:36.804 --> 34:38.147
HERE WE ARE.

34:38.147 --> 34:40.449
BUT YOU SAID THAT JANE--

34:40.449 --> 34:41.710
I-I KNOW.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.683
I SAID A LOT OF THINGS
I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.415
I'M SORRY.

34:50.589 --> 34:54.493
HE LOVES YOU, PENNY.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.795
WE BOTH DO.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.727
THERE'S NO BAD GUYS HERE.

34:58.727 --> 35:01.470
THERE'S JUST PEOPLE
TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT,

35:01.470 --> 35:06.205
AND THERE'S
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

35:06.205 --> 35:10.579
AND I KNOW HE WOULD LOVE TO
PLAY CATCH WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

35:13.582 --> 35:14.883
(sighs)

35:18.347 --> 35:19.618
(seat belt clicks)

35:26.495 --> 35:28.857
(door opens)

35:28.857 --> 35:29.898
(door closes)

35:29.898 --> 35:33.402
YOU'RE WAY PRETTIER
THAN HER.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.561
(crying)

36:13.442 --> 36:16.445
(sniffles, continues crying)

36:24.182 --> 36:26.184
YOU, UH, WANT SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

36:26.184 --> 36:28.387
UH, NO.

36:28.387 --> 36:31.460
THIS ISN'T A SOCIAL VISIT.
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

36:31.460 --> 36:32.921
AND I COULDN'T DO IT
OVER THE PHONE.

36:32.921 --> 36:34.593
OH?

36:34.593 --> 36:37.726
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID
I MIGHT NEED YOU TO, UH,

36:37.726 --> 36:40.269
COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES
FROM TIME TO TIME.

36:40.269 --> 36:41.430
YEAH.

36:41.430 --> 36:44.633
WE FOUND A BODY
OUT IN CHAPMAN WOODS.

36:44.633 --> 36:48.677
NOW IT'S PROBABLY JUST
SOME HOMELESS GUY.

36:48.677 --> 36:50.479
BUT IF WE REPORT IT--

36:50.479 --> 36:52.311
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.483
JUST LIKE THAT?

36:54.483 --> 36:56.385
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
YOU NEED TO KNOW?

36:56.385 --> 36:59.217
IT'S BETTER IF I DON'T.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.450
I OWE YOU ONE.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.492
AH.

37:03.492 --> 37:05.394
OH, HEY, BEN.

37:05.394 --> 37:08.297
HEY, SUSAN.
UH, I'M JUST LEAVING.

37:08.297 --> 37:09.798
SEE YOU AT WORK.

37:12.801 --> 37:14.933
SO YOU GOT THE JOB?
THAT'S GREAT.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.436
YEAH.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.738
JUST WAIT TILL YOU HEAR
WHAT THE JOB IS.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.843
SO... (sighs) BEN WILL DISPOSE
OF THE BODY,

37:24.843 --> 37:27.946
PERMANENTLY, HE ASSURES ME,
AND WE WILL BE IN THE CLEAR.

37:29.578 --> 37:31.019
WOW, JUST LIKE THAT.

37:31.019 --> 37:32.481
(doorbell rings)

37:32.481 --> 37:34.883
(Susan) BREE? IT'S ME!
 COME IN!

37:34.883 --> 37:38.957
(door opens and closes
in distance)
 DID ANYBODY ELSE THINK
THIS WOULD FEEL... BETTER?

37:38.957 --> 37:43.432
I THINK IT FEELS GREAT.
WELL DONE, BREE.

37:43.432 --> 37:44.893
GUESS WE GOT AWAY
WITH IT.

37:44.893 --> 37:45.834
(clink)

37:45.834 --> 37:47.636
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

37:47.636 --> 37:48.897
SUSAN, WHAT'S WRONG?

37:48.897 --> 37:53.842
OKAY, UH... YOU KNOW HOW BEN
IS PUTTING UP THOSE NEW CONDOS?

37:53.842 --> 37:55.774
HE'S DOING IT IN CHAPMAN WOODS.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.848
AND SOME OF HIS GUYS
FOUND THE BODY.

37:59.848 --> 38:02.311
HE JUST ASKED MIKE
TO GET RID OF IT.

38:02.311 --> 38:03.982
WHAT?
 YOU'RE KIDDING.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.316
GET OUT OF TOWN!

38:07.316 --> 38:08.817
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:12.060 --> 38:13.992
SWEETIE,
WE KIND OF ALREADY KNEW.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.594
WHO TOLD YOU?

38:15.594 --> 38:19.297
NO ONE. WE K-KINDA WENT
OUT THERE TO MOVE THE BODY,

38:19.297 --> 38:20.769
BUT IT WAS GONE.

38:20.769 --> 38:23.532
AND--AND THEN I WENT TO BEN,
AND HE HAD IT,

38:23.532 --> 38:26.335
AND HE WAS PLANNING
ON GETTING RID OF IT.

38:26.335 --> 38:29.808
SO, WAIT. (sighs)

38:29.808 --> 38:31.410
Y-YOU KNEW ALL OF THIS,

38:31.410 --> 38:33.812
AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU
TO TELL ME?

38:33.812 --> 38:36.645
YEAH.

38:36.645 --> 38:38.987
BUT BRIGHT SIDE IS
WE'RE ALL IN THE CLEAR NOW.

38:38.987 --> 38:40.519
YEAH.
 CHARDONNAY?

38:40.519 --> 38:43.452
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU DRAG ME INTO THIS THING.

38:43.452 --> 38:45.494
I AM OUT OF MY MIND WITH GUILT,

38:45.494 --> 38:47.696
THEN THERE'S
THIS MASSIVE COMPLICATION

38:47.696 --> 38:50.028
WHICH COULD ENDANGER ME
AND MY FAMILY,

38:50.028 --> 38:51.930
AND YOU DON'T EVEN TELL ME?

38:51.930 --> 38:54.863
(under breath) AND HERE'S
WHY WE DIDN'T TELL HER.

38:54.863 --> 38:57.366
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

38:57.366 --> 39:00.709
OH, LET'S FACE IT, SUSAN.
YOU'RE KIND OF A LOOSE CANNON.

39:00.709 --> 39:02.971
YEAH, I MEAN, 15 MINUTES
AFTER WE MADE A PACT

39:02.971 --> 39:06.014
TO KEEP THIS SECRET, YOU WERE
BEGGING US TO TELL MIKE.

39:06.014 --> 39:08.417
OH, YEAH? WELL, GUESS WHAT?
I DIDN'T TELL MIKE.

39:08.417 --> 39:11.119
CARLOS DID.
SO WHO'S YOUR LOOSE CANNON NOW?

39:11.119 --> 39:13.982
WHAT? WHY WOULD
CARLOS DO THAT?

39:13.982 --> 39:15.884
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE BECAUSE UNLIKE YOU,

39:15.884 --> 39:17.025
HE HAS A CONSCIENCE.

39:17.025 --> 39:18.427
OH, DON'T PUSH IT, SUSAN!

39:18.427 --> 39:19.828
HEY, HEY, HEY. TAKE IT EASY.

39:19.828 --> 39:21.730
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THE BODY IS GONE.

39:21.730 --> 39:23.131
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

39:23.131 --> 39:26.895
YEAH, AS LONG AS WE
DON'T GET ANOTHER LETTER.

39:28.637 --> 39:30.038
WHAT LETTER?

39:30.038 --> 39:32.000
YEAH, WHAT LETTER?

39:32.000 --> 39:36.374
(under breath) GABY, WE NEVER
TOLD THEM ABOUT THE LETTER.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.407
(whispers) CRAP.

39:38.407 --> 39:39.578
(sighs)

39:39.578 --> 39:40.579
SUSAN, WAIT.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.851
NO, NO,
YOU GET A BLACKMAIL LETTER--

39:42.851 --> 39:45.984
THE SAME ONE MARY ALICE GOT,
AND YOU DON'T TELL ME?

39:45.984 --> 39:47.516
WE DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD HANDLE IT.

39:47.516 --> 39:50.419
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR MIND WITH GUILT.

39:50.419 --> 39:52.821
OUR PACT WAS TO KEEP THIS THING
A SECRET,

39:52.821 --> 39:55.494
NOT TO KEEP SECRETS
FROM EACH OTHER.

39:55.494 --> 39:56.925
WE'REDONE.

39:56.925 --> 39:58.997
(door opens)
 OH, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE OVERREACTING A LITTLE?

39:58.997 --> 40:00.899
(slams)

40:00.899 --> 40:03.902
I DON'T THINK SHE IS.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.675
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE FOR NOT
TELLINGMEABOUT THE LETTER?

40:06.675 --> 40:09.508
WELL, HONEY, YOU WERE GOING
THROUGH ALL THAT STUFF WITH TOM.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.440
YEAH, WE WERE TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.942
PROTECT ME? WHAT AM I, A CHILD?

40:13.942 --> 40:16.615
SOMEONE KNOWS WHAT WE DID.
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.186
OF COURSE YOU DO.

40:18.186 --> 40:19.888
YOU KNOW WHAT MY LIFE
FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW?

40:19.888 --> 40:20.919
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW,

40:20.919 --> 40:23.722
EVERYTHING I COULD COUNT ON
IS GOING AWAY.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.524
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU CAN COUNT ON US.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.055
NO! APPARENTLY I CAN'T!

40:29.157 --> 40:30.529
(door opens)

40:32.030 --> 40:34.062
(door slams)

40:34.062 --> 40:36.605
(sighs)

40:42.941 --> 40:44.913
(thud)

40:44.913 --> 40:46.074
(sighs)

40:49.748 --> 40:51.550
(spritzes)

41:05.033 --> 41:07.796
(grunts)

41:07.796 --> 41:08.967
(soil crunches)

41:08.967 --> 41:10.569
(exhales deeply)

41:10.569 --> 41:12.470
(grunts)

41:12.470 --> 41:13.942
(shovel clatters)

41:17.876 --> 41:19.047
(thud)

41:22.811 --> 41:23.852
(soil crunches)

41:33.091 --> 41:35.123
(truck beeping)

41:35.123 --> 41:41.069
YES, WE'RE ALL SEEKING CONTROL
OVER SOMETHING IN OUR LIVES.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.135
WE MAY WANT TO COVER UP

41:47.135 --> 41:50.278
THE REMAINS
OF A TROUBLING SECRET...

41:55.143 --> 41:59.788
OR EASE THE PAIN
OF LETTING GO...

41:59.788 --> 42:02.150
(water spraying)

42:02.150 --> 42:06.054
OR ERASE THE MISTAKES
OF OUR CHILDREN.

42:11.860 --> 42:16.735
BUT SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY WE
CAN TRULY CHANGE OUR LIVES...

42:16.735 --> 42:17.866
FINALLY.

42:17.866 --> 42:21.069
IS BY LETTING GO COMPLETELY...

42:21.069 --> 42:24.843
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST.
