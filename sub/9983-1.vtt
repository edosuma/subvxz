-Y?
-I flinched.

04:43.972 --> 04:47.573
Honey, you're pregnant.
It's not cancer.

04:47.574 --> 04:49.675
'I get.

04:50.421 --> 04:54.659
I think I need

Ask Tony.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.397
Very well. Thank you.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.862
Sorry.
-You have to.

05:04.398 --> 05:05.832
Yes, I know.

05:25.801 --> 05:29.682
-Hey, mister.
-Hello.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.519
What are you doing up?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.939
-Take a walk in the woods.
-If?

05:36.940 --> 05:39.320
-If.
'Sounds sexy and fun.

05:39.321 --> 05:41.800
-Was galloping?
Yes, no pants.

05:41.801 --> 05:43.260
It was just what I was dreaming

05:43.261 --> 05:44.962
-Really?
'Probably I'm psychic.

05:44.963 --> 05:46.263
-It's so strange.
-If.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.016
It is not a coincidence.

05:48.017 --> 05:50.417
Even I have pants under this

05:50.418 --> 05:52.508
-Really?
-You know

05:52.509 --> 05:53.809
Seriously?

05:55.581 --> 05:58.099
Well, how about this?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.350
-Are you ready?
- If

06:01.351 --> 06:04.633
Rather be locked in a room

06:04.634 --> 06:06.930
full of snakes
or spiders?

06:06.931 --> 06:08.389
U ants

06:09.000 --> 06:11.610
-What kind snakes?
-Large

06:11.611 --> 06:14.757
-Poisonous?
-Mmm could not kill

06:14.758 --> 06:16.419
What kind of spiders?

06:16.995 --> 06:19.202
Big and ugly

06:20.600 --> 06:21.900
There could be a bear?

06:21.901 --> 06:24.228
because it seems that are going for a bear

06:24.229 --> 06:27.579
no
snakes and large spiders

06:27.580 --> 06:29.581
-Choose one.
-No ... Snakes

06:30.200 --> 06:31.732
Well,
Now one for you

06:31.733 --> 06:35.513
Rather be locked
 in a room that is ...

06:36.582 --> 06:39.080
frozen or hot?

06:39.081 --> 06:41.386
I mean really hot
As burning

06:43.500 --> 06:47.299
-I get something in the room?
-No, you get nothing!

06:47.300 --> 06:49.099
No blankets?

06:49.100 --> 06:51.224
You can have a blanket
in the hot room

06:55.600 --> 06:57.694
I have an interesting.

06:57.695 --> 07:00.215
Answer the question!
"I have an interesting".

07:02.064 --> 07:04.114
-Umm ... the hot
-If?

07:04.115 --> 07:07.210
'Now, I'm all ears
-Oh, yeah?

07:07.211 --> 07:09.371
I want to hear your riddle
forward.

07:09.372 --> 07:11.109
You're so distracted now.

07:11.110 --> 07:14.769
'You're distracting
My God, a dolphin looks sweet.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.694
I love this dolphin.

07:18.632 --> 07:20.891
You have to see what
come.

07:20.892 --> 07:22.233
-To come?
-Oh yeah.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.200
I'm going to tattoo the whole body,

07:24.201 --> 07:26.001
-It will be very sexy.
- What you gonna do?

07:26.002 --> 07:27.302

07:34.035 --> 07:36.299
'Very well, you see if you supported?
-If.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.296
-I will be there.
-Really?

07:38.297 --> 07:40.189
-If.
-Think it worthwhile?

07:46.410 --> 07:49.258
'I'm very happy.
-If?

07:50.600 --> 07:51.900
What?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.469
Grizly'm a bear!

07:56.470 --> 07:59.718
Well, move aside, no one wants

07:59.719 --> 08:01.019
-Really?
-If.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.007
-Officially've ruined the moment
-Every day.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.758
-We gotta go.
-No.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.783
It's not my fault.
Work is work.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.685
Seriously, if we now
we will not return.

08:17.376 --> 08:18.697
Come.

08:20.897 --> 08:24.046
- What are you doing there?
I was trying to scare them.

08:24.654 --> 08:26.691
Let's stay another day,
but ...

08:26.692 --> 08:29.832
-I sinto excluded.
-Is he left me.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.091
We have to leave at 5am.

08:32.092 --> 08:33.392
-Well?
-Well.

08:33.393 --> 08:34.794
Beauty?

08:35.131 --> 08:37.035
-Well
-Well, we will not go with laps

08:37.037 --> 08:39.229
-We gotta go. Really.
-Well.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.800
What?

09:00.179 --> 09:02.490
What?

09:05.800 --> 09:09.450
- What are you doing?
-Is that Tony is going to freak.

09:09.751 --> 09:13.676
Is morphine, not crack.
Well, it's almost crack.

09:13.677 --> 09:16.600
If, you know how he is.
Mr. Clean

09:16.601 --> 09:19.479
-He put him in the foot
-Really? All right.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.482
It is the hardest thing
you've done?

09:26.483 --> 09:27.783
Shut up.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.597
-They were fighting?
- What?

09:37.598 --> 09:40.276
'It was a guy thing.
-These girls ...

10:23.500 --> 10:24.850
Here

10:26.300 --> 10:28.887
-The famous waffles?
'Maybe next time.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.000
$ 20 charge.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.497
-The bathroom?
-Back.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.632
Excuse me.

10:45.515 --> 10:48.088
My car ran out of fuel
and is 1 km from here

10:49.800 --> 10:52.765
- You think you can take me?
He finished his fuel?

10:52.766 --> 10:55.567
Yeah not a good night for
a walk, right?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.198
Think you can give me
a ride?

11:01.300 --> 11:04.138
-Yes, of course. No problem.
'All right. Thanks

11:04.139 --> 11:05.439
-Just give me a minute.
'All right.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.779
-Thank you.
-Let

11:07.700 --> 11:09.000
Thank you.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.719
Everything went well?

11:33.034 --> 11:36.381
No more toilet paper
so I had to use my hands.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.271
-Just a minute, okay?
-Yeah sure, no problem.

11:42.050 --> 11:44.700
What? I told him we'd give him a ride
It ran out of fuel

11:44.701 --> 11:47.600
We were rushing to get home
and delay us now okay?

11:47.601 --> 11:50.058
No, it goes in the same
direction we

11:51.125 --> 11:52.780
Do not you think you should ask before

11:52.781 --> 11:55.681
to offer as a taxi
an unknown stalker?

11:55.682 --> 11:59.880
She is as much a single rush.
-Unknown Stalker

11:59.881 --> 12:02.720
You're probably right.
The new style is stalking

12:02.721 --> 12:05.447
lead young people on the roadside
to 1 am.

12:05.947 --> 12:07.247
Not funny.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.761
How about if you had been a
I was hitchhiking?

12:10.430 --> 12:13.488
I'm just saying ... to pick up a woman
in a service station ...

12:14.300 --> 12:17.657
-Hi, I'm Diana.
-Tayler.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.170
'I'm Nick.
-Thank you both.

12:21.171 --> 12:22.471
No problem.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.033
We will give you a ride

12:30.507 --> 12:31.910
Thank you.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.863
I love that song ...

14:07.600 --> 14:11.703
-Your perfume smells ... smells good.
-Thank you.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.672
I designed it myself.
It's what I do.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.819
Did not you say that your car was here?

14:24.820 --> 14:27.841
Yes, it is.
It's right there.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.820
Wait a minute, I'll bring
some samples for you guys

14:53.821 --> 14:55.753
'No need.
-I insist.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.299
She is so ..
I know, I'm sorry.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.700
But that club.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.700
shit!

15:06.700 --> 15:08.000
Holy shit!

15:12.000 --> 15:13.300
Damn it!

15:23.400 --> 15:25.100
and we tied

15:28.400 --> 15:29.700
That means nothing.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.800
I say we do.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.000
I do not even know
if the video is real.

15:37.900 --> 15:41.200
I do not think we can 100%
with only 4 of them.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.500
Maybe not with what we have.

15:43.501 --> 15:45.500
This is not right,
and you know it.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.000
Guys are starting to wake up

15:51.600 --> 15:53.800
Shit!
We have to take uma decision.

15:55.111 --> 15:56.484
I'll take for us

16:05.700 --> 16:07.000
Jesus Christ!

16:08.900 --> 16:10.900
What the fuck is wrong with you?

16:22.500 --> 16:23.800
Stop!. Stop!. Stop!

16:31.000 --> 16:33.499
Get your hands off me.
Get away from me!

16:33.500 --> 16:35.000
Okay, okay.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.101
-What's going on?
I do not know.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.401
We were trapped
here too.

16:45.301 --> 16:47.100
You do not know?
You do not know?

16:47.101 --> 16:50.100
Why the fuck broke the nail
my girlfriend?

16:50.101 --> 16:52.100
-The Video!
-The video is shit!

16:52.101 --> 16:53.500
What video?

16:53.501 --> 16:55.201
You have to see for yourself

16:58.901 --> 17:00.601
Come upstairs.
Come.

17:01.701 --> 17:03.100
Come!

17:03.101 --> 17:04.401
Come!

17:49.901 --> 17:51.901
Hello Welcome
my house

17:53.701 --> 17:56.500
I apologize for the
uncomfortable circumstances

17:56.501 --> 17:58.100
that brought them here

17:58.101 --> 18:00.801
But I can assure
that by working together,

18:00.802 --> 18:03.000
May leave all
very little time

18:03.001 --> 18:05.300
 As everyone has noticed,

18:05.301 --> 18:09.200
I installed a piece of jewelry
at the head of each of you.

18:09.201 --> 18:12.501
This device serves
to do one thing only:

18:12.502 --> 18:14.978
Which consists in obtaining
particularly certain chemicals

18:14.979 --> 18:17.601
 their brains
occur naturally.

18:18.101 --> 18:20.701
Unfortunately,
the chemist who need

18:20.702 --> 18:23.152
They are produced only when

18:23.153 --> 18:26.100
The brain tells the body
that is in danger.

18:26.101 --> 18:29.001
Pain is the only
Out of this house.

18:30.301 --> 18:32.800
This will not be easy for either
of you

18:32.801 --> 18:35.200
But by working together,

18:35.201 --> 18:38.900
I have confidence that find
the way through this process

18:38.901 --> 18:42.501
as safely and efficiently as
possible.

18:43.301 --> 18:46.800
22 hours will be awarded
to fulfill its task.

18:46.801 --> 18:49.148
The clock starts
 the countdown

18:49.149 --> 18:50.801
As soon as they start.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.101
Good Luck.

18:57.801 --> 18:59.101
There's your explanation.

19:00.801 --> 19:02.101
What the hell ...

19:06.701 --> 19:10.100
I'm Nick,
she is Tayler,

19:10.101 --> 19:11.900
-Tony ...
-Hello.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.500
Sam, Greg, Julian and Tara.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.900
Fantastico!
We're all friends.

19:16.901 --> 19:19.500
We can find a way
leaving this shit house?

19:19.501 --> 19:22.401
Already checked. It's all locked up.
There is no escape.

19:22.402 --> 19:25.100
Maybe we forzarr something
or knock down this door.

19:25.101 --> 19:28.600
force? force?
the kitchen counter?

19:28.601 --> 19:32.200
That is, are steel plates.
You can not force.

19:32.201 --> 19:34.000
There must be a way.

19:34.001 --> 19:35.301
None except the video

19:35.701 --> 19:37.600
The video is fake, right?

19:37.601 --> 19:39.600
It's just a fucking sick joke.

19:39.601 --> 19:41.100
It's true.

19:41.101 --> 19:42.401
How do you know?

19:42.402 --> 19:44.776
The chemicals in the
I was talking about are:

19:44.777 --> 19:46.539
Dopamine, serotonin
and adrenaline.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.601
They do drugs
with these things.

19:49.301 --> 19:50.800
The video is very real.

19:50.801 --> 19:52.101
She's not lying.

19:53.301 --> 19:56.301
The drug is made to experience
in people.

19:58.101 --> 19:59.800
How are we going to do?

19:59.801 --> 20:02.201
Do what?
Torturing? Among us?

20:03.201 --> 20:04.700
We will not.

20:04.701 --> 20:07.401
There must be another way
leaving this house.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.601
You know, people
brought us.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.101
obviously has the power
to stay here.

20:15.102 --> 20:16.779
They came and captured

20:16.780 --> 20:19.002
and had no possibility
to resist or fight.

20:19.003 --> 20:21.902
Well, look ...
How long have we been here?

20:21.903 --> 20:24.703
Who knows? Maybe have been
several days.

20:25.603 --> 20:27.003
Idiot!

20:28.403 --> 20:30.103
Do you realize
what have you done?

20:30.800 --> 20:33.802
Now we are here
and damn you started the countdown.

20:33.803 --> 20:36.202
We have not discussed
something like this before.

20:36.203 --> 20:38.403
Sorry, I was a
both concerned about

20:38.404 --> 20:40.503
-Surviving, to schedule ...
-Damn it!

20:41.903 --> 20:46.802
Well, the clock has started and
Talk will not stop him.

20:46.803 --> 20:48.203
I can not do this.

20:49.403 --> 20:52.803
You want to take the risk
to find out what happens when
the clock reaches zero?

20:54.403 --> 20:56.202
We are nine, right?

20:56.203 --> 20:59.002
I'm thinking
that if we separated,

20:59.003 --> 21:00.903
perhaps
not so bad

21:02.203 --> 21:05.202
I do not separate myself sucks

21:05.203 --> 21:07.002
With none of you.

21:07.003 --> 21:08.702
There must be another way.

21:08.703 --> 21:12.202
I'm telling you, man,
You are locked.

21:12.203 --> 21:13.902
What we been?

21:13.903 --> 21:15.503
Wait, you two know each other?

21:15.504 --> 21:18.002
-Calm down, Julian ...
-You did this

21:18.003 --> 21:21.503
'You're gonna get us killed.
Do not say anything stupid

21:24.103 --> 21:25.503
This is just a house!

21:28.703 --> 21:31.203
Let me out!

21:31.703 --> 21:33.003
! Motherfuckers!

21:35.903 --> 21:38.402
Want pain?
I'll give you pain ...

21:38.403 --> 21:41.703
But you will not get
nothing of me.

21:46.103 --> 21:48.803
I we do
a vote, right?

21:49.903 --> 21:52.902
Who thinks to do
what the girl said the tv?

21:52.903 --> 21:55.703
so we can
out of here ...

21:57.303 --> 21:59.302
Raise your hand.

21:59.303 --> 22:00.603
Right?

22:11.803 --> 22:13.703
Well, let's do it then.

22:23.603 --> 22:24.903
Fuck it.

22:28.703 --> 22:30.603
-I would not do that, man.
-Fuck you.

22:31.003 --> 22:33.803
I will not spend more
a single second in this house.

22:33.804 --> 22:35.104
Julian!

22:35.105 --> 22:38.205
You need to be
tough guy ...

23:16.186 --> 23:19.050
My God!

22:35.204 --> 22:37.804
Only needs to be
a very tough guy.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.323
He's dead.

23:26.324 --> 23:27.624
There is only one option.

23:29.524 --> 23:31.323
You guys should not
be men?

23:31.324 --> 23:33.324
Having a little more
responsibility?

23:33.724 --> 23:36.024
You want to engage
 women in this?

23:38.400 --> 23:40.824
I want to live to see
my son again.

23:41.724 --> 23:45.923
And if I have to torture
each of the women here ...

23:45.924 --> 23:47.224
will.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.949
We are all in this together.

23:50.950 --> 23:53.599
So no trash feminism
Right?

23:53.600 --> 23:57.223
Damn feminism?
Son of a bitch!

23:57.224 --> 23:58.724
Who do you think you are?

23:59.424 --> 24:01.223
-Hey, stop!
-Waste of feminism?

24:01.224 --> 24:03.624
Stop, stop, okay?
Can we at least agree

24:03.625 --> 24:05.724
not going to discuss
stop the clock?

24:05.725 --> 24:07.924
He's running.
We're wasting time.

24:07.925 --> 24:11.224
Okay, but I say
He might be the first.

24:19.824 --> 24:22.424
Very well.
I think I'll do the honors.

25:09.824 --> 25:11.729
Shit.
This is not working.

25:11.730 --> 25:13.030
Says who?

25:13.430 --> 25:17.030
We did this for an hour.
We have to think of something else.

25:17.630 --> 25:20.130
Is taking too long
and energy intensive.

25:21.830 --> 25:23.130
He's right ...

25:24.230 --> 25:26.429
I do not know much
the subject, but ...

25:26.430 --> 25:29.229
I'm pretty sure the brain
produces these chemicals

25:29.230 --> 25:30.930
of which she was talking ...

25:31.250 --> 25:33.730
All you need is ...

25:35.530 --> 25:36.830
Is it?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.729
Just ...
have sex ...

25:41.730 --> 25:43.129
Ah ... please ...

25:43.130 --> 25:45.729
Now is not the time
to think about that little boy.

25:45.730 --> 25:47.229
Just saying ...

25:47.230 --> 25:48.530
Well, do not do

25:49.062 --> 25:51.529
Fucking disgusting piece of shit.

25:51.530 --> 25:53.530
I'd rather be tortured.

25:54.230 --> 25:56.830
Well, then ...
What do we do?

26:01.630 --> 26:02.930
Guys ...

26:04.130 --> 26:06.830
I think Greg had the idea
correct after all.

26:26.430 --> 26:28.029
Listen, pal ...

26:28.030 --> 26:30.830
We will stop at 14%
Is it okay?

26:32.230 --> 26:33.591
Right?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.230
Hurry up with that.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.230
Should I hit him with my shoe
or something?

26:41.600 --> 26:44.230
I think we will have
to be a little rough.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.930
I remember you.

27:24.130 --> 27:26.049
- How much are we?
-7.5%!

27:26.050 --> 27:29.630
Almost there, friend,
Hold. Almost there.

27:29.631 --> 27:32.431
Wait. He knows something
not telling us.

27:34.131 --> 27:36.631
What I was saying
Julian, Greg?

27:36.632 --> 27:38.831
About being a tough guy?

27:38.832 --> 27:40.866
Do you know who is doing this?

27:44.431 --> 27:45.931
Tell us what you know!

27:48.531 --> 27:50.830
I do not know ...
nothing.

27:50.831 --> 27:52.131
I know nothing.

27:53.231 --> 27:54.731
Son of a bitch!

28:04.731 --> 28:08.231
No! No! What the fuck?
What the fuck?

28:15.031 --> 28:16.630
Stop!

28:16.631 --> 28:19.331
Stop!
Stop!

28:30.431 --> 28:32.230
Are we going to leave?

28:32.231 --> 28:35.130
No, no, no.
This is not over yet.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.931
No time to waste, remember?

28:45.031 --> 28:46.531
Tell us what you know!

28:47.331 --> 28:48.631
What is your problem?

28:49.931 --> 28:51.231
Is my problem?

28:51.931 --> 28:55.631
He knows ...
We voted, remember?

28:58.631 --> 29:00.931
And it was you who changed
extreme methods.

29:01.431 --> 29:03.731
I changed ...?
Are you crazy?

29:05.531 --> 29:07.331
You broke her leg
half!

29:07.931 --> 29:11.731
Even if we allow the psychopath
leave the house, how will he escape?

29:12.331 --> 29:14.630
How the hell are we going to get out of here?

29:14.631 --> 29:16.730
What the hell was I supposed to do?

29:16.731 --> 29:19.431
You said, from torturing the guy,
so torture the guy, damn!

29:19.931 --> 29:24.631
He knows something and is not telling us!
And remember what you said Julian?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.030
Look, we have to be
smart with this.

29:28.031 --> 29:32.031
None of us want
go through this. You okay?

29:33.031 --> 29:34.331
Shit.

29:36.531 --> 29:37.831
Well, be careful.

29:39.331 --> 29:40.631
Shit.

29:41.831 --> 29:43.131
When is your turn?

29:43.731 --> 29:45.031
Fuck

29:47.931 --> 29:49.231
This is not over.

29:51.531 --> 29:52.831
Who's next?

29:53.331 --> 29:54.631
I found this.

29:58.331 --> 30:01.031
Well, that's not such a good idea

30:01.032 --> 30:03.131
this is done in each
at once.

30:04.143 --> 30:05.971
What do you suggest?

30:06.548 --> 30:08.767
Make like half and half.

30:08.768 --> 30:10.767
All we can
end like Greg.

30:12.487 --> 30:14.795
Half or all together,

30:14.796 --> 30:17.000
nobody will cut
nothing of my body.

30:17.001 --> 30:19.227
My fingers
stay with me.

30:19.228 --> 30:20.935
Thank you very much.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.848
Nick is right.

30:23.849 --> 30:25.951
We'll have to get
Greg from here.

30:26.331 --> 30:28.990
We can not afford any more
serious leg injuries.

30:29.907 --> 30:32.558
In my opinion, I think that we should not
do anything at all.

30:33.224 --> 30:35.284
If we refuse
into her game,

30:35.285 --> 30:37.371
at least achieve
these bastards

30:37.372 --> 30:38.860
display.

30:39.961 --> 30:41.747
Maybe it's a hoax.

30:41.748 --> 30:43.411
And if she's right?

30:43.412 --> 30:46.300
And if we do nothing?
We let the clock run.

30:46.301 --> 30:48.329
We may be enough
strong to fight

30:48.330 --> 30:50.263
against whoever
we are doing this.

30:51.386 --> 30:53.021
No.
We will not.

30:54.121 --> 30:55.495
Think

30:57.766 --> 30:59.302
We're all here.

30:59.779 --> 31:02.199
We grabbed
in an open,

31:02.200 --> 31:04.628
We're supposed to fill
one of these little bottles,

31:04.629 --> 31:06.478
Why the
right not full?

31:07.696 --> 31:10.719
These things are sending
or received a signal.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.330
Whoever we
put here

31:13.639 --> 31:16.158
we can kill with only
 pressing a button.

31:16.159 --> 31:18.663
And never disclose their
identity to us.

31:20.283 --> 31:23.852
We must act intelligently,
we have to think how to overcome this,

31:24.539 --> 31:26.635
we can all leave
of here alive.

31:32.502 --> 31:33.806
I agree.

31:34.147 --> 31:36.370
Yes, you're right.

31:38.378 --> 31:39.945
I guess I also agree.

31:41.420 --> 31:44.519
So now we have to
Carefully torture us?

31:44.520 --> 31:45.822
Twice??

31:45.823 --> 31:48.371
So expect this
 not a hoax?

31:48.372 --> 31:50.246
And then we leave
free?

31:50.247 --> 31:52.910
Yes, exactly
what.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.796
Is it okay for you pineapple?

31:55.170 --> 31:58.238
Do not talk that way,
princess.

31:58.239 --> 32:00.419
I will not support a
fuck you.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.624
Stop.
Stop, right?

32:02.625 --> 32:05.127
Do not do this
in a silly fight.

32:05.428 --> 32:08.151
Talk is not going to take
anywhere.

32:08.152 --> 32:10.660
We have important decisions
to make.

32:10.661 --> 32:14.262
For example, how do we decide
who's next?

32:14.263 --> 32:17.139
We have to move forward with the plan.
The clock is ticking.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.700
Talk to us we will
help anything.

32:32.888 --> 32:34.212
We will overcome.

32:36.394 --> 32:37.764
With what?

32:40.756 --> 32:42.096
Come with me.

32:42.491 --> 32:43.799
Come with me.

34:35.502 --> 34:37.103
I'll go first.

35:46.740 --> 35:48.044
All right.

36:04.832 --> 36:06.477
Damn it, come on.

36:07.997 --> 36:09.949
Let's do this
shit here.

36:11.349 --> 36:12.755
Come.

36:24.887 --> 36:26.200
Oh, shit.

36:34.231 --> 36:36.003
Are you going to undress?

36:36.635 --> 36:38.283
It's my favorite shirt.

36:39.594 --> 36:41.567
What the hell is all this?

36:42.732 --> 36:44.544
Not everyone was
a good childhood.

36:44.545 --> 36:46.051
Is this going to work at least?

36:46.052 --> 36:47.993
Can you at least feel something?

36:48.875 --> 36:50.799
A girls like scars

36:52.183 --> 36:53.488
Wait.

36:53.923 --> 36:56.046
-Promise
- What?

36:56.599 --> 36:58.999
Promise me you will not get
with my genitals.

37:01.743 --> 37:04.689
Okay, Sure.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.109
Nothing genitals.

37:06.930 --> 37:08.300
I think I speak for us all

37:08.301 --> 37:10.800
when I say that I wish
if they did the same.

37:10.801 --> 37:12.782
Yeah, I'm with him.

37:13.104 --> 37:15.495
I do not want anyone
touch my face.

37:16.825 --> 37:18.903
Really?
Are you kidding?

37:19.559 --> 37:22.311
Now is not the time
of being vain, guys.

37:22.312 --> 37:24.894
Do not think I protect my
ball is in vain.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.411
Sure, if you want to touch
your face, we'll think of something.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.995
Seriously, what's your problem?

37:29.996 --> 37:32.691
You are my problem.
Incredible.

37:32.692 --> 37:34.024
Bitch!

37:35.075 --> 37:37.264
Very well.
Are you ready?

37:45.071 --> 37:46.377
Sorry, mate.

38:16.035 --> 38:17.794
Are we?

38:17.795 --> 38:19.156
We're

38:19.572 --> 38:22.751
-1.5% To finish, okay?
-Come.

38:26.078 --> 38:28.833
-Use the pliers.
- What?

38:29.744 --> 38:32.583
Use the pliers.

38:37.468 --> 38:38.902
Are you ready?

38:38.903 --> 38:40.255
Come on, man.

38:40.620 --> 38:42.686
Here we go.
Are you ready?

38:42.687 --> 38:44.031
If.

38:44.343 --> 38:45.843
Wait, do not need this.

38:45.844 --> 38:48.212
Let's do it.
Come.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.819
All right, buddy.

39:00.579 --> 39:02.043
Shit.

39:06.243 --> 39:07.989
-We?
-We?

39:08.750 --> 39:10.079
Very well.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.435
All right.

39:12.202 --> 39:13.696
Damn, that is.

39:24.900 --> 39:27.347
-Shit
-We get

39:27.840 --> 39:29.781
That's it.

39:30.131 --> 39:31.455
You did.

39:36.843 --> 39:38.258
Good job, buddy.

39:47.411 --> 39:48.711
Be careful with that

39:52.871 --> 39:54.626
Shit.
I have you.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.522
Sorry, mate.

40:11.014 --> 40:12.686
Jesus Christ.

40:13.643 --> 40:14.967
We did it.

40:53.907 --> 40:55.211
Are you okay?

40:56.743 --> 40:58.609
Superb.

40:58.610 --> 41:01.343
Sorry.
Stupid question.

41:05.735 --> 41:07.055
You ...

41:08.139 --> 41:09.671
You were very good.

41:12.638 --> 41:13.980
Thank you.

41:17.705 --> 41:19.022
Thank you.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.790
Why?

41:23.778 --> 41:25.159
I do not know.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.963
Taking over

41:31.455 --> 41:33.371
Help us out of this.

41:34.642 --> 41:37.098
At least someone here
common sense.

41:38.843 --> 41:40.471
probably
would have ended

41:40.472 --> 41:42.291
dead
if not for you.

41:45.252 --> 41:46.671
Probably ...

41:47.039 --> 41:48.431
If.

41:56.158 --> 41:58.200
Do you think
out of here?

42:03.679 --> 42:05.178
Not all

42:06.366 --> 42:07.890
Not all

42:11.331 --> 42:12.659
If.

42:13.354 --> 42:15.098
Probably
you're right

42:20.998 --> 42:22.979
What will you do if
you get out?

42:31.258 --> 42:33.269
Continue to work

42:33.270 --> 42:35.318
Really?
So much you like your job?

42:40.603 --> 42:42.070
No, not really

42:45.658 --> 42:47.210
And what are you gonna do?

42:48.534 --> 42:49.854
Not.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.027
Whatever it is,

42:55.347 --> 42:57.021
Tayler will be there.

43:03.767 --> 43:05.410
Can you do me
a favor, man?

43:05.411 --> 43:07.962
I feel I am
losing a lot of blood here.

43:07.963 --> 43:10.910
Could you bring me some gauze
the other room?

43:10.911 --> 43:12.223
Sure.

43:12.224 --> 43:14.706
 Nick.
It's your turn.

43:14.707 --> 43:16.452
Shit!

43:19.000 --> 43:21.587
I'll go look for them, man.
Do not worry.

43:28.778 --> 43:31.185
Do you think they'll let me
do here?

43:35.059 --> 43:37.715
Yeah, right.
Why not?

44:03.514 --> 44:05.051
He will be fine.

44:07.666 --> 44:10.493
We are now tying
so ...

44:13.091 --> 44:15.878
Not so.
I know Nick will be strong.

44:16.843 --> 44:18.359
I'm so scared.

44:24.547 --> 44:26.027
So do I.

44:35.482 --> 44:38.227
One must concentrate.

44:38.639 --> 44:41.109
Focus on this end.

44:42.774 --> 44:46.322
The pain will pass, you know?
That is ...

44:46.323 --> 44:49.099
That's what Sam said

44:49.655 --> 44:51.831
That's what Sam said?

44:52.411 --> 44:54.715
Genial.
This is wonderful.

44:56.979 --> 44:59.138
I'm just trying to help,

44:59.139 --> 45:01.802
I had not
easy for me.

45:04.491 --> 45:07.299
Sorry.

45:07.300 --> 45:09.716
It's just that I have other things
in my mind now.

45:14.547 --> 45:16.527
I'm pregnant for a month.

45:18.590 --> 45:20.206
Are you serious?

45:24.410 --> 45:26.474
I was going to tell
this weekend.

45:29.300 --> 45:30.927
Does he not know?

45:34.279 --> 45:35.889
Just ...

45:35.890 --> 45:37.600
Just tell
when we're done.

45:38.987 --> 45:40.299
Do you know?

45:41.115 --> 45:43.479
We will find a way,
Okay?

45:43.480 --> 45:44.962
I promise.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.500
What are you doing?

46:09.501 --> 46:11.011
Is that Tony is going to freak.

46:11.012 --> 46:12.866
Is morphine, not crack.

46:12.867 --> 46:15.051
If, you know how he is.
Mr. Clean

46:32.674 --> 46:35.108
Where is Tayler?
I do not want to start without her.

46:35.109 --> 46:37.183
Vou go for it
Right?

46:37.680 --> 46:39.362
No time
for this.

46:39.363 --> 46:42.503
Fuck
I want to wait for my girlfriend.

46:50.363 --> 46:52.182
You have to trust me.

46:52.506 --> 46:53.822
I love you.

46:56.191 --> 46:57.519
Greg is awake.

46:57.520 --> 46:59.500
He can lift?
'Not by chance

46:59.501 --> 47:02.935
We will have to make a stretcher
or something to remove it.

47:03.724 --> 47:05.082
Maybe not.

47:05.083 --> 47:08.583
What do you mean? How do we get out of here
with him? is a big guy.

47:10.066 --> 47:12.300
All I'm saying is that you
are right.

47:12.742 --> 47:14.710
If we get out of here,

47:15.118 --> 47:17.627
We will need
all the strength we have.

47:17.628 --> 47:20.050
That is why
decided to divide.

47:20.051 --> 47:21.566
-Half and half
-Right

47:21.567 --> 47:24.691
What I'm saying is, we all
to make our first part.

47:24.692 --> 47:27.146
Sam is not
so badly injured as Greg.

47:27.147 --> 47:30.032
Sam did not have a fucking screwdriver
tucked into knee, right?

47:30.033 --> 47:32.539
What you're saying is:
make our halves,

47:32.540 --> 47:35.579
leave it there
and do the rest of Greg?

47:35.580 --> 47:37.914
Lower your voice,
He might hear you.

47:37.915 --> 47:39.235
Really?

47:39.236 --> 47:41.594
He will die. If we leave,
will die.

47:41.595 --> 47:44.191
What else can we do?
-Go ahead with the plan.

47:45.694 --> 47:47.800
-I agree with her.
- What? No! No!

47:47.801 --> 47:49.902
No, dear ...
I do not want to be like him.

47:49.903 --> 47:51.652
I can not do this anymore.

47:52.023 --> 47:53.606
I can not do.

47:53.950 --> 47:55.962
He was going to do with us

47:55.963 --> 47:58.160
Did you forget that he was
he who tied us all?

47:59.282 --> 48:00.811
We agree.

48:01.223 --> 48:03.503
What?
You two?

48:07.502 --> 48:10.138
Sam.
What about you?

48:13.858 --> 48:15.190
Whoa!

48:15.191 --> 48:17.269
Fucking awesome.

48:17.270 --> 48:20.403
You know what?
Do what you want.

48:20.404 --> 48:21.841
I'll take
my portmanteau

48:21.842 --> 48:24.100
because they do not want
in my consciousness.

48:24.101 --> 48:26.991
-Honey, please do not.
Do not touch me.

48:28.299 --> 48:29.947
They are cowards.

48:30.791 --> 48:34.238
And because they are cowards,
deserve to be here.

48:44.911 --> 48:47.460
The clock is ticking,
let's end this.

48:49.722 --> 48:51.087
So ...

48:51.638 --> 48:54.179
We will continue
with the original plan.

49:21.400 --> 49:22.790
Tear one more.

49:39.511 --> 49:41.978
Today is wrong to be strong.

49:51.714 --> 49:53.079
No.

49:53.443 --> 49:55.252
No, please, stop.

50:07.897 --> 50:09.379
Push the damn hole!

50:09.380 --> 50:13.087
No, please, stop.
Please stop.

50:17.659 --> 50:19.122
What happened?

50:19.502 --> 50:22.102
Why not raised the
percentage as the others?

50:23.064 --> 50:24.422
Not.

50:24.850 --> 50:26.866
That will happen
with all of us?

50:27.210 --> 50:30.585
- Should we make it harder?
-No.

50:31.875 --> 50:34.226
We need to calm down
Right?

50:35.139 --> 50:39.326
Maybe it has to do with
chemical balance of each.

50:50.719 --> 50:52.026
All right.

50:53.826 --> 50:56.343
You will not leave here
crying.

50:57.690 --> 50:59.292
You can do it

51:00.652 --> 51:02.103
You must be strong ...

51:02.104 --> 51:04.974
No! Get away from me!
I do not want to do this.

51:16.174 --> 51:17.582
Let's get it.

51:44.695 --> 51:47.158
What?
No, no.

51:47.735 --> 51:50.369
Come on, we have
time for this.

51:50.370 --> 51:53.427
Shut up, you fucking bitch.
Just go.

51:53.428 --> 51:55.251
I do not want to do this.

51:58.711 --> 52:01.867
We're all in this together,
Remember? We are a team.

52:03.043 --> 52:04.610
She's right, Lisa.

52:04.611 --> 52:06.778
Do not make us pull
the door, okay?

52:06.779 --> 52:08.536
We will end soon.

52:08.537 --> 52:09.914
Please.

52:10.371 --> 52:11.727
Please.

52:12.638 --> 52:14.288
I do not want to do this.

52:38.516 --> 52:40.739
Damn it!
No, no!

52:40.740 --> 52:42.371
No!
I do not want to go.

52:42.372 --> 52:45.154
Come!
No, I do.

52:45.155 --> 52:47.855
I do not want.

52:47.856 --> 52:51.406
No! No! No!

52:51.407 --> 52:53.799
Let me!

52:53.800 --> 52:56.055
Grab his legs.
Grab his legs.

52:56.056 --> 52:59.293
Please do not.
I do not want to do this.

53:00.359 --> 53:01.682
No!

53:02.018 --> 53:03.720
Please
do not make me do this.

53:03.721 --> 53:05.359
Please!
Please!

53:05.758 --> 53:08.247
Do not want to do this.

53:11.246 --> 53:12.902
God!

53:34.790 --> 53:36.122
Sorry.

53:36.699 --> 53:38.247
I'm sorry.

53:40.707 --> 53:42.335
I wanted to help.

53:45.394 --> 53:46.972
I'm sorry.

53:54.911 --> 53:56.851
I heard what
said about Greg.

53:57.510 --> 53:58.899
About quitting.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.386
I will not

54:03.549 --> 54:05.586
Do not let anyone
touch it again

54:05.587 --> 54:06.967
You do not understand.

54:06.968 --> 54:08.670
Understand that?

54:09.645 --> 54:13.078
What a man
suffer and die to save himself?

54:13.079 --> 54:15.375
Not only did I save myself Nick

54:19.219 --> 54:21.894
Go look the monkey
to see which level you are.

54:28.111 --> 54:29.739
Perhaps almost finished.

54:34.230 --> 54:36.107
I thought the pills
might be helpful.

54:36.108 --> 54:37.543
Well, I took

54:40.046 --> 54:41.827
I'm pregnant, Nick.

54:44.195 --> 54:45.576
What?

54:47.798 --> 54:49.126
Pregnant?

55:00.279 --> 55:02.864
She did.
Order.

55:27.903 --> 55:29.529
So now that you are pregnant.

55:29.907 --> 55:31.515
Should
you out?

55:31.516 --> 55:33.362
I beg you.

55:33.363 --> 55:36.798
Pleading not work.
I had to.

55:36.799 --> 55:38.634
So everybody
has to.

55:39.495 --> 55:42.450
No, she did not

55:42.451 --> 55:43.751
I will.

55:43.752 --> 55:45.170
I will take his place.

55:47.018 --> 55:49.191
The clock is ticking,
Superman.

55:49.192 --> 55:51.783
Still missing you 6%

55:53.187 --> 55:56.008
There is a good reason for
Tayler is'm not occurred?

55:57.210 --> 55:59.464
The pills were in my stocking
and I forgot.

55:59.465 --> 56:02.542
Just trying to help,
I'm sorry, I swear.

56:06.604 --> 56:07.947
Pills do?

56:08.311 --> 56:09.619
What pills?

56:09.620 --> 56:14.347
I forgot. The suit
and forgot I had them.

56:14.348 --> 56:16.406
Did you pills
all this time?

56:17.387 --> 56:18.852
The want

56:19.253 --> 56:21.406
I did my part.
Give them to me!

56:31.482 --> 56:33.887
No, no, no, no.

56:33.888 --> 56:35.383
Do not.

56:36.415 --> 56:39.731
He did his part.
He owes us nothing.

56:39.732 --> 56:42.500
Nick?
Hey, Nick, take the pills.

56:42.501 --> 56:43.955
-Sam, rectrocede.
-We voted.

56:43.956 --> 56:47.602
-Step back, dammit.
Well, whatever.

56:47.603 --> 56:49.144
We will not
to touch

56:49.690 --> 56:51.130
They voted for that?

56:52.511 --> 56:54.163
What are you talking about?

56:55.850 --> 56:57.150
Come on, man.

57:01.010 --> 57:02.838
They wanted to leave
here.

57:03.746 --> 57:07.620
Use all your pain
and then leave you here.

57:08.752 --> 57:10.948
Take them,
is the only way.

57:12.715 --> 57:15.400
You, good boy,
That was not your decision.

57:15.401 --> 57:16.932
You can not
simply decide

57:20.734 --> 57:22.422
We have to get back to work.

57:22.991 --> 57:24.480
The clock is ticking.

57:26.791 --> 57:28.399
What will we do with Tayler?

57:29.537 --> 57:30.855
I will.

57:31.230 --> 57:32.739
Come on man,
know you can not.

57:32.740 --> 57:35.090
Since these all fucking
and you still have the other half.

57:35.091 --> 57:36.535
No, no, I can bear.

57:37.278 --> 57:39.990
No. Tony and I'll help
to share part of it.

57:41.400 --> 57:44.621
No matter what you do,
let's get on with it.

58:01.938 --> 58:03.246
Very well.

58:03.247 --> 58:04.962
We all at one time.

58:05.538 --> 58:07.859
We will not stop until I make
to 60%.

58:08.422 --> 58:09.811
We can do this.

58:10.670 --> 58:13.719
Thanks for doing this.

58:13.720 --> 58:17.207
I love you, Tay.
We will overcome.

58:18.182 --> 58:19.622
Are you ready?

58:28.978 --> 58:31.846
I can not!
I can not!

58:38.874 --> 58:40.879
Sorry.

58:47.187 --> 58:48.503
Come on, one more time.

58:50.527 --> 58:51.858
Again.

58:54.023 --> 58:56.750
No! No!
No!

59:20.811 --> 59:22.111
No!

59:34.902 --> 59:36.507
Hello, sleepyhead.

59:38.319 --> 59:40.063
Look who's
awakening.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.639
We started
to miss.

59:43.654 --> 59:45.278
Wait
one second

59:46.950 --> 59:48.972
What percent
we achieved?

59:48.973 --> 59:52.811
You'll be happy to know that the last
coup has given us 48%

59:54.244 --> 59:55.859
So we go over 6%
to 54%.

59:56.455 --> 59:58.090
Alright!
Alright!

59:58.612 --> 01:00:00.303
Let's wrap this up

01:00:01.074 --> 01:00:03.767
Let's go beyond 6%
this time

01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:05.663
What?

01:00:06.218 --> 01:00:09.018
No, all voted,
agreed 6% ...

01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:11.120
We did another vote.
you were out

01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:12.421
Then, we vote for you.

01:00:12.422 --> 01:00:14.573
You've been very generous offer
the way you did.

01:00:14.574 --> 01:00:16.316
Fuck you!

01:00:16.923 --> 01:00:19.335
Damn you all to hell!

01:00:23.735 --> 01:00:26.634
Do not worry.

01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:29.435
We will not do anything
that we've done.

01:00:30.511 --> 01:00:32.542
We voted, pig!

01:00:33.094 --> 01:00:34.989
Not just me.

01:00:36.255 --> 01:00:39.450
Do not ...

01:00:39.451 --> 01:00:42.128
Motherfuckers!

01:00:44.214 --> 01:00:45.710
He knows something.

01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:47.830
Why do not you tell us?

01:00:48.131 --> 01:00:49.707
Why do not you tell us?

01:00:50.702 --> 01:00:52.114
It's a drug dealer!

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:55.523
It's a drug dealer.
He sells this shit! It's him!

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:58.459
Is it, why not
hear me?

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.945
No need to do that.
Let's do it ourselves.

01:01:09.946 --> 01:01:11.603
Try to relax.

01:01:20.212 --> 01:01:21.528
Kai!

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.201
My God!

01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:29.835
My God, Kai!

01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:34.187
My God!

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:38.399
My God!

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.900
Nick!

01:01:44.251 --> 01:01:45.762
God.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.800
Open your eyes.

01:02:13.679 --> 01:02:16.862
- Son of a bitch!
-Tony, no! We need it!

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.491
Thank you.

01:02:30.062 --> 01:02:33.546
She is mine.

01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:35.406
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:41.989
Sorry!
It was an accident!

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:44.783
It was an accident!
I would never have done that!

01:02:44.784 --> 01:02:46.958
Sorry!

01:02:46.959 --> 01:02:50.044
-I never did it on purpose.
-Keep the head.

01:02:50.045 --> 01:02:52.712
Sorry!

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.963
There

01:04:44.163 --> 01:04:45.465
Well ..

01:04:46.455 --> 01:04:49.242
I do not think we can
get any more of it.

01:04:49.243 --> 01:04:51.139
- Really?.
We have no more time-

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.055
We have to do something fast.

01:04:53.379 --> 01:04:54.727
Right.

01:04:55.763 --> 01:04:57.550
We will follow the plan.

01:04:58.222 --> 01:05:00.666
'I'll go first.
-No, Lisa is right.

01:05:00.667 --> 01:05:03.220
We do not have enough time
to do it this way.

01:05:03.854 --> 01:05:05.180
If.

01:05:06.283 --> 01:05:09.374
- What else can we do?
-We will do as a group.

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.370
Three simultaneously.
Everyone helps.

01:05:12.606 --> 01:05:16.159
There is only 16%. It's more of
2% for each and go.

01:05:16.588 --> 01:05:19.559
I do not think Greg
can help.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.902
Those pills
have greatly affected.

01:05:21.903 --> 01:05:23.300
Well,
five of us then.

01:05:23.301 --> 01:05:25.743
No matter, but
we must do it at once.

01:05:28.922 --> 01:05:31.670
Does anyone have any suggestions?

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:39.488
When I was a kid,
I broke my collarbone.

01:05:40.243 --> 01:05:42.199
Nothing hurts so much.

01:05:43.118 --> 01:05:44.826
Can you use your arms?

01:05:48.956 --> 01:05:52.503
Okay, so ...
Who will do the honors?

01:05:54.607 --> 01:05:55.971
I will.

01:06:14.816 --> 01:06:16.122
Are you ready?

01:06:17.078 --> 01:06:18.687
Does it matter?

01:06:19.031 --> 01:06:20.582
This is gonna hurt.

01:06:22.802 --> 01:06:24.186
I think so.

01:06:42.934 --> 01:06:44.466
All right.

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:46.243
Very well.

01:06:49.279 --> 01:06:50.588
Very well.

01:06:57.331 --> 01:06:59.058
Do it in me.

01:06:59.059 --> 01:07:01.603
No!
Please, I can do it!

01:07:01.604 --> 01:07:03.990
Please not her.

01:07:09.479 --> 01:07:11.095
My turn.

01:07:12.216 --> 01:07:13.915
It's what she would have wanted.

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:38.426
Congratulations!
I knew I could do it.

01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:41.929
They are on the verge of
regain their freedom. 

01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:45.920
In the room, the door
front, find a retractor. 

01:07:45.921 --> 01:07:47.867
Pull the same and the machine

01:07:47.868 --> 01:07:50.686
 remove the devices.
- Fuck you!

01:07:50.687 --> 01:07:53.172
Let's get out of here!

01:07:53.173 --> 01:07:56.918
And everyone will leave
here as promised.

01:07:56.919 --> 01:07:59.494
Thank you again,
for your cooperation.

01:07:59.495 --> 01:08:03.189
And I wish all
a long and happy life.

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:49.278
Right. Release me!

01:09:00.194 --> 01:09:01.505
Right.

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:03.191
Very well.

01:09:03.192 --> 01:09:05.770
Then we have
to be fast, right?

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:08.254
I'll be there
and help them to go, right?

01:09:15.743 --> 01:09:17.158
Care.

01:09:17.158 --> 01:09:19.731
Right. Care.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:23.482
Well, watch out.

01:09:29.075 --> 01:09:32.274
Do not smile yet.
I'm not done with you.

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.718
You should not let
this place.

01:09:38.502 --> 01:09:39.850
You're next,
companion.

01:09:41.442 --> 01:09:43.298
Bring the
Kai body?

01:11:22.558 --> 01:11:23.918
Come on, honey.

01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:31.291
Let's move on.

01:11:33.518 --> 01:11:35.474
Are you ready, Sam?

01:11:35.475 --> 01:11:36.835
You can send it.

01:11:38.526 --> 01:11:39.855
I have it.

01:11:57.703 --> 01:12:01.263
Damn it! Nick! Nick!

01:12:01.779 --> 01:12:04.075
See, I help
Greg pass.

01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:06.727
- Are you sure? Going to be okay?
'I'll be right behind you.

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.491
I love you.
-You too.

01:12:18.492 --> 01:12:21.216
Wait, take this.
not know about the other side.

01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:34.974
It was him! It was him!

01:12:44.383 --> 01:12:46.142
No!

01:12:47.259 --> 01:12:49.578
It's him.

01:12:49.579 --> 01:12:52.790
It's him.
I know.

01:12:54.642 --> 01:12:56.138
You have to stop.

01:12:58.658 --> 01:13:00.348
-Stop it
-Back for you.

01:13:05.738 --> 01:13:08.700
'You could help too.
'I'm trying

01:13:08.701 --> 01:13:10.003
My leg is ...

01:13:10.004 --> 01:13:11.800
'Wait here.
-God!

01:13:11.801 --> 01:13:13.101
Sorry.

01:13:13.102 --> 01:13:15.407
What are you doing?

01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:19.919
Give me a minute.

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:22.863
All we need
is to loosen the tension.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.883
Would you take
or you leave here?

01:13:29.211 --> 01:13:30.979
Never mind.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.486
They found me
whatever happens.

01:13:35.896 --> 01:13:38.239
Who?
Who will you find?

01:13:39.462 --> 01:13:43.367
I did not think rumors
were true.

01:13:44.358 --> 01:13:47.154
I thought they were just stories
they had.

01:13:47.907 --> 01:13:50.007
Do you really know who did
this with us?

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:51.847
She said ...

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:55.522
She said that 10 000
by pills, but ...

01:13:56.643 --> 01:13:59.182
Any dealer
pay 12 mil.

01:13:59.890 --> 01:14:01.191
Easy.

01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:07.489
People will pay any price,
no matter where you come.

01:14:08.907 --> 01:14:11.742
You're part of this?
Were you one of them?

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.662
No.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.414
I only sell

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:22.307
I did not know.

01:14:24.234 --> 01:14:28.138
I did not think rumors
were true.

01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:35.600
Who would think that people
I do this to other people

01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:37.434
just to get money?

01:14:37.435 --> 01:14:39.306
shit!

01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:50.331
I know.

01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:56.806
I know I do not deserve it,
but, please, take me out.

01:14:59.079 --> 01:15:00.699
You deserve it.

01:15:27.271 --> 01:15:29.190
Hello Welcome
my house

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.023
No! No! No!

01:15:32.024 --> 01:15:34.846
No way!
No way!

01:15:35.684 --> 01:15:38.398
But I can assure
if they work together,

01:15:38.399 --> 01:15:40.387
 out of here
soon.

01:15:40.439 --> 01:15:41.923
Damn it!

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.495
What are you doing, Nick?

01:15:55.167 --> 01:15:57.002
You should go back
with your friends.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.980
How could you do that?

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.931
No lights good friend

01:16:03.932 --> 01:16:06.475
Let me tell you something.
If you leave now

01:16:06.476 --> 01:16:08.646
I let you get back to
Tay ..

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.491
You dare not speak its name.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.355
Want to see what you are doing
at this time?

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.582
Please let her go.

01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:14.774
I can not.

01:17:15.185 --> 01:17:16.970
You do not understand, do you?

01:18:19.213 --> 01:18:22.085
Congratulations. Sabia
you could do it.

01:18:22.086 --> 01:18:24.723
You are one step away from
regain their freedom.

01:18:26.524 --> 01:18:29.080
My offer still stands.
Go and say goodbye to her.

01:18:29.081 --> 01:18:30.400
Fuck.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:35.004
Very well.
Do what you want

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.000
Sorry.

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:48.600
Everyone can leave
here as promised.

01:18:49.209 --> 01:18:51.510
Thanks again
for your cooperation.

01:18:51.511 --> 01:18:55.188
I wish you a long
and happy life.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.693
I know, man.
is difficult.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.800
It's hard.

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.900
You are about to die

01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:19.701
You could be saying goodbye
your girlfriend

01:19:19.702 --> 01:19:22.016
but you're here with me

01:19:23.407 --> 01:19:26.752
Incidentally, probably
this takes about 10 minutes

01:19:26.753 --> 01:19:28.548
to kill,
so ...

01:19:28.643 --> 01:19:32.582
Okay, I know ...
I said it a hundred times,

01:19:32.583 --> 01:19:35.834
she should use a chemical
with faster reaction, but ...

01:19:35.835 --> 01:19:38.767
These guys are
some sick bastards

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.453
You know that you
are my fifth group?

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:44.827
I did not think that would
until now.

01:19:44.828 --> 01:19:47.406
Further considering the
feelings each other.

01:19:47.407 --> 01:19:49.235
Except for Tara, man.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.399
What girl does not?

01:19:54.438 --> 01:19:57.343
When your girlfriend
she was pregnant ...

01:19:58.206 --> 01:20:00.850
Seriously, I had to leave ...
I almost had to stop.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.310
mate ...

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.489
Tony.

01:21:24.789 --> 01:21:26.289
Come!

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.928
I do not even know why I
takes the trouble to look.

01:23:02.929 --> 01:23:04.961
knows
asked to waffles.

01:23:04.962 --> 01:23:07.700
Maybe not. Maybe I want
try something new ..

01:23:07.701 --> 01:23:09.414
Yes, but you do not want.

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.957
What is the dish of the day?

01:23:13.999 --> 01:23:17.689
Very well. Well,
fried eggs with toast ...

01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:19.289
No, no eggs.

01:23:19.902 --> 01:23:22.589
-Baguette with cheese?
-No ...

01:23:23.409 --> 01:23:25.307
I learned they are pretty good.

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:28.288
Just good enough?

01:23:28.778 --> 01:23:31.057
Well, we're famous
for our waffles ..

01:23:31.579 --> 01:23:32.926
Really?

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.389
Brilliant
Then ask that.

01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:37.189
Egghead

01:23:37.489 --> 01:23:38.917
Completed the other?

01:23:39.753 --> 01:23:41.123
If.

01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:43.213
That must have hurt.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.314
It could have been worse.

01:23:45.315 --> 01:23:46.849
I do not like needles.

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.040
But they are beautiful.

01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:52.989
He is in love
of dolphins, right?

01:23:56.389 --> 01:23:57.689
If ...

01:24:02.489 --> 01:24:04.989
Sure ...
Be right back.

01:24:48.889 --> 01:24:50.989
-There you go.
-Thanks.

01:24:51.289 --> 01:24:53.096
Thank you so much.

01:24:53.097 --> 01:24:56.689
Wait a second, I'll look
some samples for his wife.

01:24:56.989 --> 01:24:59.307
You do not know women too
married right?

01:24:59.308 --> 01:25:00.689
Have a good night.

01:25:01.389 --> 01:25:02.916
Wait a second!

01:25:03.354 --> 01:25:04.660
Damn it!

01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:06.489
Damn it!

01:25:06.789 --> 01:25:08.541
Redneck Damn!

01:25:10.475 --> 01:25:12.237
What a waste.

01:25:53.889 --> 01:25:55.389
I love this song.
