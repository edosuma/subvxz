new insight

00:22.533 --> 00:24.232
into what our coaches
were thinking

00:24.233 --> 00:26.166
as they built
their teams of 12.
Yay!

09:13.700 --> 09:15.732

09:15.733 --> 09:17.432

- Hi!

09:17.433 --> 09:19.432
[Laughter]
Oh, no.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.232
I am willing to get myself
in bad trouble here,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.199
[Laughter]
Okay, Savannah.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.199
I can't understand
how the girls don't want
to go with the girl,

09:40.200 --> 09:42.232
and... and I don't want to be
intimidating,

09:42.233 --> 09:44.732
but I want you to know
that I have so much to offer you

09:44.733 --> 09:46.199
that he can't!
I think you're being
a little intimidating.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.332
No, I know, but he can't...
[Laughter]

09:49.333 --> 09:51.366

That's what I wanted.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.299
Like, I want a young girl
that needs help.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.666
She knows she can do
all this stuff with her voice,

10:02.667 --> 10:04.366
and you can tell
she's deep and emotional

10:04.367 --> 10:05.932
for being 16 years old.

10:05.933 --> 10:08.799
But she just needs
a little bit of guidance.

find herself as an artist.

channeled her life story during

14:59.433 --> 15:01.699
I remember the first time
someone said "lesbian,"

15:01.700 --> 15:03.132
and I'm like, "What's that?"
And they were like,

15:03.133 --> 15:05.499
"Oh, it's when a girl
likes a girl

15:05.500 --> 15:07.699

should like boys."

15:11.200 --> 15:13.899
But my dad was the pastor
of the Baptist church

15:13.900 --> 15:15.699

was also preaching

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.532
Blake: Yeah!

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:45.599
[Cheers and applause]

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.032
Oh, my God!

01:12:47.033 --> 01:12:48.432
Yes!

01:12:48.433 --> 01:12:50.266
Whoo!

01:12:50.267 --> 01:12:53.232
Oh, my gosh. I'm so excited.

01:12:53.233 --> 01:12:55.166
So, who is
your inspiration?

01:12:55.167 --> 01:12:58.766
I grew up with Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard,

01:12:58.767 --> 01:13:01.099
the Highwaymen,
Faith Hill.
Uh-oh.
Mm.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.366
Holy moly.

01:13:02.367 --> 01:13:03.599
[Laughter]

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.032
Now we're talkin'.
Those are my roots.

01:13:05.033 --> 01:13:06.732
None of that was
good news for you, Alicia,

01:13:06.733 --> 01:13:08.699
but that is not... that is not
insurmountable, okay?

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.766
Kick it.
[Cheers and applause]

01:13:10.767 --> 01:13:13.632
Okay.
I just did, if you recall,

01:13:13.633 --> 01:13:17.632
the ACMs with Cam
honoring Little Big Town.

01:13:17.633 --> 01:13:20.532
- Yes.
- So, real music

01:13:20.533 --> 01:13:23.866
transcends boxes.

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:27.199
Brennley, I would like
to say that I have never been

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.699
a guest artist at a...
at a country concert

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.132
because I am
the country concert.

01:13:34.133 --> 01:13:35.932
[Cheers and applause]

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:37.032
Wait a minute.

01:13:37.033 --> 01:13:38.566
You don't want
most people as possible

01:13:38.567 --> 01:13:40.366
to hear your message?

01:13:40.367 --> 01:13:41.799
Like, that's not a limit...
Yeah, sure, I do,
but they're gonna have to

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.566
turn it to a country station
to hear it, though.

01:13:43.567 --> 01:13:44.232
[Laughter]

01:13:44.233 --> 01:13:45.632
I pick Blake.

01:13:45.633 --> 01:13:46.932
Yes!

01:13:46.933 --> 01:13:48.299
Whoo.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.766
I'm so excited!

01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:50.899
Brennley!

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:52.599
Blake: I love the potential
that I have

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.832
with somebody like Brennley.

01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:55.866
The fact that Brennley
is 14 years old,

01:13:55.867 --> 01:13:57.766
I think this girl
can go a long way...

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.999
[Laughs]
How about this right here?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.399
Oh, yeah. You like that?
You like that?

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.466
Do you like that?

01:14:04.467 --> 01:14:06.532
Guys, somebody
call the paramedic.

01:14:06.533 --> 01:14:08.567
[Laughter]
Blake's having a stroke.

01:14:09.933 --> 01:14:11.399
Somebody...

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.566
Whoo, child.

01:14:13.567 --> 01:14:17.099
Daly: Another big win for Blake
was four-chair turn Casi Joy,

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.999

on your team, you go,

01:15:02.767 --> 01:15:04.732
"Oh, my gosh,
I truly have a chance

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:05.932

01:15:05.933 --> 01:15:07.700

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.099
You are so good!

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:24.232
I would literally try to leap
over the moon and back for you.

01:15:24.233 --> 01:15:28.732
But I have been beaten down
so many times

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.299
by hearing
a voice like yours,

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:34.632
which clearly is rooted in
that traditional country thing.

01:15:34.633 --> 01:15:39.266
So I'm not gonna get my hopes up
because I am too exhausted.

01:15:39.267 --> 01:15:43.566
[Laughter]
But I have sang in all genres,
so I'm not just country.

01:15:43.567 --> 01:15:45.766
I'd like to retract some
of my previous statements.

01:15:45.767 --> 01:15:48.332
[Laughter]

01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:49.866
Those were the rantings
of a madman. I...

01:15:49.867 --> 01:15:50.966
[Laughter]

01:15:50.967 --> 01:15:53.232
I, uh...

01:15:53.233 --> 01:15:56.899
I've changed.
I've changed, Casi.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.199
Can I just clear the air?
I am not tired.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.932
I-I feel like
I'm just in my prime.

01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:03.999
[Cheers and applause]

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.499
I am not giving up
until Casi is on my team

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:12.432
because this is
meant to freakin' be.

01:16:12.433 --> 01:16:13.732
I pick Blake.

01:16:13.733 --> 01:16:14.766
Yes!

01:16:14.767 --> 01:16:17.399
[Cheers and applause]

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.766
I was getting worried
for a minute.

01:16:18.767 --> 01:16:20.532
I couldn't be happier right now
'cause I do think

01:16:20.533 --> 01:16:24.032
we've only barely seen
the tip of the iceberg

01:16:24.033 --> 01:16:27.599
with what Casi's
capable of doing as a vocalist.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.099
Wow! Wow!
[Laughs]

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.466
I'm very happy with the team
that I was able to put together.

01:16:34.467 --> 01:16:36.466
My team is full!

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.466
[Cheers and applause]

01:16:38.467 --> 01:16:39.932
I want to win this season

01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:42.932
as badly as I wanted to win
Season 1.

01:16:42.933 --> 01:16:47.332
I really think that I have
the winner on my team.

01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:49.399
I can't wait
to start the battles

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.666
so I can get in there
and start working with my team.

01:16:51.667 --> 01:16:53.199
Whoo!

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.532
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:16:55.533 --> 01:16:59.532
Daly: Here is a sneak peek
at Blake and his battle adviser,

01:16:59.533 --> 01:17:03.299
chart-topping country-music
superstar Luke Bryan.

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.466
Finally.
12 seasons to get you here.

01:17:06.467 --> 01:17:07.766
Yes, I missed you, buddy.
I'm glad you're here, buddy.

01:17:07.767 --> 01:17:09.299
I love you.
Give me a kiss.
I missed you, sugar.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:12.199
Luke Bryan may be
the most popular artist

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.766
in country music today.

01:17:13.767 --> 01:17:15.066
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:17:15.067 --> 01:17:16.566
How are y'all?
I don't want to get hurt.

01:17:16.567 --> 01:17:17.932

was under control.

Same!
Thank you.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.099

be working with Blake Shelton

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.299

sitting right next to him.

fight all the time,

01:20:11.267 --> 01:20:13.132
deep down,
they love each other.

01:20:13.133 --> 01:20:14.832

You're like... You're like,
