WEBVTT

00:08.875 --> 00:10.944
YOU'RE WATCHING NEWS MAX
KIDS.

00:10.944 --> 00:13.146
AT 1:00 IT'S "WHITE POWER
RANGERS."
BUT FIRST, IT'S "TED CRUZ

00:13.146 --> 00:29.596
STREET."
HELLO.
HELLO.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.865
I AM TEXAS SENATOR AND LAST ONE
INVITED TO THANKSGIVING
TED CRUZ.

00:31.865 --> 00:37.103
NOW, FOR 50 YEARS, I STOOD BY AS
"SESAME STREET" TAUGHT OUR
CHILDREN DANGEROUS IDEAS, LIKE

00:37.103 --> 00:42.842
NUMBERS AND KINDNESS.
BUT WHEN BIG BIRD TOLD CHILDREN
TO GET VACCINATED AGAINST A

00:42.842 --> 00:49.082
DEADLY DISEASE, I SAID,
"ENOUGH."
AND I CREATED MY OWN "SESAME

00:49.082 --> 00:55.989
STREET" CALLED "CRUZ STREET."
IT'S A GATED COMMUNITY.
KIDS ARE SAFE FROM THE WOKE

00:55.989 --> 00:57.957
GOVERNMENT.
TELL 'EM, KIDS.
**

00:57.957 --> 01:05.732
* CRUZY DAYS
SWEEPING THE LIBS AWAY
AND HE HOPES YOU'LL SAY *

01:05.732 --> 01:11.504
* THAT HIS BEARD
LOOKS SWEET
GRAB AN EAGLE AND A GUN *

01:11.504 --> 01:18.812
* BRING A GUN
TO CRUZ STREET *
DID SOMEONE SAY BRING GUN?

01:18.812 --> 01:22.949
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
OH, I'M JUST TAKING A BREAK

01:22.949 --> 01:26.886
FROM RELEASING THE PHONE NUMBERS
OF REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THE
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL SO THEY AND

01:26.886 --> 01:30.256
THEIR FAMILIES GET DEATH
THREATS.
AND I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY.

01:30.256 --> 01:36.529
HERE KID, YOU WANT TO HOLD A
AR-15?
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD.

01:36.529 --> 01:39.632
PUSSY.
NOW, I HEAR YOU HAVE A WORD
FROM OUR SPONSOR.

01:39.632 --> 01:44.337
THAT'S RIGHT.
TODAY'S EPISODE IS BROUGHT TO
YOU BY Q.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.474
NOT THE LETTER, THE MAN.
HE WILL TELL US WHEN JFK, JR.,
WHO IS ALIVE, WILL REVEAL

01:47.474 --> 01:52.912
HIMSELF AND HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP
RECLAIM HIS RIGHTFUL THRONE.
YES, EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT

01:52.912 --> 01:57.884
SOUNDS RIGHT.
THANKS, MARJORIE.
I REPRESENT AMERICA.

01:57.884 --> 02:03.623
NOW, AS YOU KNOW, I WAS
MOCKED FOR ATTACKING BIG BIRD ON
TWITTER.

02:03.623 --> 02:08.828
SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M A HUMAN
SENATOR AND HE IS AN EIGHT FOOT
TALL FICTIONAL BIRD.

02:08.828 --> 02:13.533
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO
BIG BIRD AFTER HE GOT THE
VACCINE.

02:13.533 --> 02:17.704
**
WHOA, MAN.
I DON'T FEEL TOO GOOD.

02:17.704 --> 02:22.909
SO, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED A
WEEK AFTER YOU GOT THE VACCINE?
IT SURE IS.

02:22.909 --> 02:30.750
MY FEATHERS FELL OUT.
MY NUTS GOT HUGE AND MY DOINK
DON'T WORK.

02:30.750 --> 02:36.489
IT'S REAL BAD, MAN.
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
I READ ONLINE THAT YOU CAN TAKE

02:36.489 --> 02:41.161
A BATH IN BORAX AND THAT WILL
CLEANSE YOU OF ANY NANO
TECHNOLOGIES.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.331
ARE YOU SURE, SENATOR CRUZ?
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF DUMB.
NO, YOU'RE DUMB.

02:45.331 --> 02:50.570
AND BORAX IS COOL.
MAYBE THE VACCINE GAVE ME
COVID!

02:50.570 --> 02:54.874
YES.
YES, THAT SOUNDS CORRECT.
BUT LET'S ASK OUR RESIDENT

02:54.874 --> 03:05.685
MEDICAL EXPERT, JOE ROGAN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I USED TO HOST "FEAR FACTOR,"

03:05.685 --> 03:13.493
AND NOW DOCTORS FEAR ME.
CAN YOU HELP ME, JOE?
SURE THING, BIG BIRD.

03:13.493 --> 03:28.641
I TOOK DOWN CARLOS MENCIA.
I CAN TAKE DOWN COVID.
HERE'S SOME ZINC, SOME PROTEIN

03:28.641 --> 03:31.244
AYAHUASCA, AND YOU KNOW, SOME
HORSE MEDICINE.
WHY WOULD A BIRD TAKE HORSE

03:31.244 --> 03:33.847
MEDICINE?
WELL, I'M A HUMAN AND I TOOK
HORSE MEDICINE.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.816
AND SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT ARE
HORSELIKE, TODAY'S OTHER TWO
SPONSORS ARE THE LETTERS S AND

03:36.816 --> 03:45.825
D.
AS IN, I COULD S MY OWN D.
OH, MY GOD.

03:45.825 --> 03:50.497
IS THIS A SHOW FOR KIDS?
NO ONE UNDER 65 WATCHES.
I'M ALMOST 30.

03:50.497 --> 03:54.701
THANKS, JOE ROGAN.
BUT S AND D AREN'T THE ONLY
LETTERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:54.701 --> 04:00.407
TODAY.
THERE'S ALSO THREE TERRIBLE
LETTERS, CRT.

04:00.407 --> 04:14.254
CRITICAL RACE THEORY.
AND I THINK IT STANDS FOR KAU
CAUTION RIGHTS TRANSPORT.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.623
THAT'S WHY THE PROUD BOYS HAVE
BEEN INVADING SCHOOL BOARD
MEETINGS TO KEEP CRT OUT OF OUR

04:16.623 --> 04:18.358
CLASSROOMS.
PLEASE WELCOME TWO OF THE PROUD
BOYS, BERT AND ERNIE.

04:18.358 --> 04:24.564
HI, TED.
AND YEAH, WE'RE OUT AND
PROUD!

04:24.564 --> 04:28.134
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY ARE OUT THERE EVERY DAY,
PROUDLY FIGHTING THE PROGRESSIVE

04:28.134 --> 04:38.578
AGENDA.
YOU KNOW, OUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS PROGRESSED A BIT.

04:38.578 --> 04:44.417
WE GOT ENGAGED!
[ APPLAUSE ]
ENGAGED IN A BATTLE AGAINST

04:44.417 --> 04:57.464
THE TYRANNY OF WOKE.
HEY, ERNIE, LET'S GO TAKE A
BATH.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.066
WOW, THEIR GIRLFRIENDS ARE VERY
LUCKY.
OUR NEXT GUEST IS LIKE ME.

05:00.066 --> 05:13.113
HE DON'T TAKE NO GUFF FROM
NOBODY.
IT'S MY NEMESIS, OSCAR THE

05:13.113 --> 05:19.552
GROUCH.
PAPA JOE BIDEN GAVE ME SO
MANY STIMULUS, I DECIDED TO QUIT

05:19.552 --> 05:22.956
LIVING.
NOW YOU ALL WORK HARD AND BIDEN
GIVES ME YOUR MONEY.

05:22.956 --> 05:27.060
WOW.
AND YOU HAVE NO SHAME ABOUT
THAT?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.529
UHN-UHN.
I'M PROUD.
I'M A WARD OF THE STATE.

05:29.529 --> 05:35.435
I USE YOUR TAX MONEY ON DRUGS
AND PORNOGRAPHY.
AT LEAST HE ADMITTED IT.

05:35.435 --> 05:43.309
ALL DEMOCRATS ARE IMH.
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL FIND

05:43.309 --> 05:55.522
OUT HOW TRUMP WON THE ELECTION
WITH THE RECAP COUNT.
AND DON'T MISS THE WORD OF

05:55.522 --> 06:02.028
THE DAY, FREEDOM, WITH MS.
BRITNEY SPEARS.
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.

06:02.028 --> 06:10.603
WE DID IT!
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

06:16.843 --> 06:19.579
IT'S "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"
WITH --

08:13.893 --> 08:17.530
TAYLOR SWIFT.
AND YOUR HOST, JONATHAN MAJORS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

08:17.530 --> 08:22.635
AND YOUR HOST, JONATHAN MAJORS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
JONATHAN MAJORS.

08:41.588 --> 08:45.358
I'M EXCITED.
I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE.
THIS IS EXCITING.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.863
MY NAME IS JONATHAN MAJORS.
I AM IN THE NEW NETFLIX WESTERN,
"THE HARDER THEY FALL,"

08:49.863 --> 08:55.068
ALONGSIDE IDRIS ELBA.
IT WAS FUN.
IT WAS FUN FILMING THAT MOVIE.

08:55.068 --> 08:59.606
BUT IF YOU EVER WANT TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK, DEFINITELY
SPEND TWO MONTHS STANDING RIGHT

08:59.606 --> 09:06.413
NEXT TO IDRIS ELBA.
HUMBLES YOU.
GROWING UP, I'M A MILITARY BRAT.

09:06.413 --> 09:13.753
MY FATHER WAS IN THE AIR FORCE.
I MOVED AROUND A LOT.
I LIKE TO SAY I WAS BORN IN

09:13.753 --> 09:16.056
CALIFORNIA, RAISED IN TEXAS,
EDUCATED IN NORTH CAROLINA,
ROUGHED UP IN NEW YORK CITY, AND

09:16.056 --> 09:20.794
RE-EDUCATED IN NEW HAVEN,
CONNECTICUT.
WHICH I GUESS IS MY ROUNDABOUT

09:20.794 --> 09:28.868
WAY OF SAYING, YEAH, I WENT TO
YALE.
[ APPLAUSE ]

09:28.868 --> 09:34.074
ALL RIGHT.
BUT, LISTEN, IT'S WILD.
IT'S REALLY WILD TO BE HERE ON

09:34.074 --> 09:37.210
THIS STAGE.
WHEN THEY TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO
HOST "SNL," I SAID, "IMPOSSIBLE.

09:37.210 --> 09:41.848
NA
FOR REAL FOR REAL?"
IT'S BEEN CRAZY.

09:41.848 --> 09:45.752
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY JOURNEY.
WHEN I WAS 17, I WAS HOMELESS.
I LIVED IN MY CAR, WORKING AT

09:45.752 --> 09:47.854
RED LOBSTER AND OLIVE GARDEN.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED FROM
THAT EXPERIENCE?

09:47.854 --> 09:51.057
YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED?
THAT RED LOBSTER AND OLIVE
GARDEN ARE OWNED BY THE SAME

09:51.057 --> 09:56.396
PARENT COMPANY.
SO YOU CAN WORK AT BOTH PLACES
WITH NO PROBLEM.

09:56.396 --> 10:00.400
SIDE NOTE, IT IS CRAZY HOW MANY
PEOPLE GOT THEIR START AT RED
LOBSTER.

10:00.400 --> 10:05.705
BOTH NICKI MINAJ AND CHRIS ROCK
WORKED THERE.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

10:05.705 --> 10:12.712
PUTTING IN THOSE CHEDDAR BAKED
BISCUITS, BUT IT'S WORKING.
[ APPLAUSE ]

10:12.712 --> 10:17.217
ALL RIGHT.
REALLY, THAT EXPERIENCE, IT
TAUGHT ME -- IT TAUGHT ME A LOT.

10:17.217 --> 10:22.022
IT TAUGHT ME TO WORK HARD.
IF YOU TRUST A PLAN, GREAT
THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

10:22.022 --> 10:27.994
I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER.
I'M GOING TO BE IN THE NEXT
MARVEL

10:27.994 --> 10:32.632
"ANT-MAN" MOVIE, OR AS THE BLACK
COMMUNITY LIKES TO CALL IT, NOT
"BLACK PANTHER."

10:32.632 --> 10:40.974
AND NOW I AM INDEED HOSTING
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
[ APPLAUSE ]

10:40.974 --> 10:43.977
THAT'S DOPE.
I REMEMBER THE MOMENT.
I REMEMBER THE MOMENT WHEN THE

10:43.977 --> 10:47.180
WEIGHT OF ALL THAT KIND OF HIT
ME.
IT FINALLY SANK IN.

10:47.180 --> 10:55.321
I WAS LAYING IN BED, LOOKING AT
THE CEILING.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I GOT THIS HUGE

10:55.321 --> 11:01.327
BURST OF ENERGY.
BOOM.
SCARES YOU.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.096
SOMETHING BIG JUST HAPPENED.
AND IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY THAT IT'S BIG.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.964
YOU CAN'T LET THE BIGNESS SCARE
YOU.
I THOUGHT BACK TO SOME ADVICE MY

11:04.964 --> 11:10.770
GRANDDADDY ALWAYS TOLD ME.
HE SAID, "GRANDSON, EVERYTHING'S
BIG AT FIRST.

11:10.770 --> 11:15.842
BUT YOU WALK UP ON IT.
YOU FACE IT.
PRETTY SOON, IT'S SO SMALL, YOU

11:15.842 --> 11:20.347
CAN PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET."
.
WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS THE TAG

11:20.347 --> 11:24.718
LINE FOR THE NEXT "ANT-MAN"
MOVIE.
ALL RIGHT.

11:24.718 --> 11:29.489
LOOK, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR
Y'ALL TONIGHT.
TAYLOR SWIFT IS IN THE HOUSE, SO

11:42.435 --> 11:45.972
**
YOU'RE WATCHING THE HISTORY
CHANNEL.

11:45.972 --> 11:49.275

HITLER'S PERSONAL WAIVERS."
NOW, WE RETURN TO "FORGOTTEN

DESERVE HER HAND.
MY LIEGE, HOW UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.906
LOVE WITH HER BUT SHE DOESN'T
LIKE HIM IN THAT WAY.
PRESENTING THOMAS OF SNEEDLO.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.308
WOW.
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
I TOLD YOU, THOMAS.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.111
I DO NOT LIKE YOU LIKE THAT.
AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT I CAN
CHANGE ABOUT MYSELF FOR YOU TO

12:58.111 --> 13:06.920
CONSIDER MARRYING ME.
IT MEAN, LITERALLY ALL OF IT.
OKAY.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.190
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.
REMEMBER OUR JOKE?
NO.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.360

NO.
PLEASE JUST GO.

13:13.360 --> 13:19.065

13:30.143 --> 13:32.746
HE'S SO DAMN FILTHY.
BUT THEY SAY HE'S GOT A HUGE
SAUSAGE.

13:32.746 --> 13:35.081
BIGGER THAN HE WAS WHEN HE WAS
BORN.
AND THIS MILK MAID WILL TELL

13:35.081 --> 13:40.553
YOU.
SHE'S SEEN IT.
IT'S CRAZY, MY LADY.

13:40.553 --> 13:49.195
THANK YOU, MY LADY.

MY HEART.
FAREWELL.

14:01.875 --> 14:08.481

THANK YOU, MAN.
THAT'S VERY NICE.
IT GOT ME THINKING.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.653
I WAS LIKE, "WE SHOULD ALL DO A
VIDEO TOGETHER."
I HAVE THIS IDEA, WHERE MAYBE WE

17:00.653 --> 17:04.324
CAN DO LIKE A MUSIC VIDEO ABOUT
HOW WE'RE ALL LIKE BEST FRIENDS
AND HOW WE'RE LIKE BOYS.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.427
WE WOULD BE IN IT WITH YOU?
YEAH.

26:19.546 --> 26:26.219
LITTLE BOY?
CAYDEN HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO
PERCEPTIVE, AND

26:26.219 --> 26:27.921
IT'S LIKE HE CAN SEE OTHER
WORLDLY THINGS THAT WE CAN'T
SEE.

26:27.921 --> 26:35.395
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
OH, WELL, LIKE THE OTHER DAY,
WE WERE WALKING BY A CEMETERY --

26:35.395 --> 26:38.732
AND HE STARTS WAVING AT
SOMEONE, ONLY THERE'S NO ONE
THERE.

26:38.732 --> 26:42.802
DO NOT LIKE IT.
SO I SAY, "WHO ARE YOU WAVING
AT?"

26:42.802 --> 26:49.576
AND HE SAYS, "THE MAN IN THE RED
JACKET."
THE WHO IN THE WHAT NOW?

26:49.576 --> 26:54.280
AND THE WEIRD PART IS --
THAT WASN'T THE WEIRD PART?
WELL, WHEN I WAS TUCKING HIM

26:54.280 --> 26:58.985
INTO BED THAT NIGHT, HE WAVED AT
THE CORNER OF HIS BEDROOM AND I
SAID WHO ARE YOU WAVING AT NOW?

26:58.985 --> 27:09.596
AND HE GOES, "THE MAN IN THE RED
JACKET, HE FOLLOWED US HOME."
NO!

27:09.596 --> 27:11.664
NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.
ALL RIGHT.

27:11.664 --> 27:16.169
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, BUT

27:25.779 --> 27:29.549
SON, MAX.

NO.

27:29.549 --> 27:31.618
NO, THE KID ALREADY LOOKS
CREEPY.
HASN'T EVEN SAID A WORD.

27:31.618 --> 27:46.599
THERE'S NOTHING BEHIND HIS
EYES.
ALL RIGHT.

27:46.599 --> 27:52.072
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME
YOUR KID'S TALE, MAN.
ALL RIGHT.

27:52.072 --> 27:55.608
WELL, A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WAS
WATCHING A WORLD WAR II DOC AND
THEY WERE SHOWING FOOTAGE OF

27:55.608 --> 27:57.877
THESE FIGHTER PLANES AND OUT OF
THE BLUE, MAX TURNS TO ME AND HE
SAYS, "WHEN I WAS OLD, I FLEW A

27:57.877 --> 28:06.786
PLANE LIK
WHEN HE WAS OLD?
HE SAID WHEN HE WAS OLD?

28:06.786 --> 28:11.224
NAH.
THAT IS NOT A SENTENCE I WANT
COMING OUT OF A CHILD'S MOUTH.

28:11.224 --> 28:13.126
WELL, YEAH, SO IN A PAST
LIFE, MAX HERE WAS A WORLD WAR
II FIGHTER PILOT.

28:13.126 --> 28:17.063
TELL THEM WHAT AIRCRAFT CARRIER
YOU SERVED ON, PAL.
SARATOGA.

28:17.063 --> 28:23.837
HE KNOWS THE NAME OF THE
SHIP.
HE KNOWS THE NAME OF THE SHIP!

28:23.837 --> 28:27.040
YEAH.
SO MAX HAS A REALLY VIVID MEMORY
OF HIS PLANE GETTING SHOT DOWN

28:27.040 --> 28:39.319
AND GOING UNDER WATER.
TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED NEXT,
I DIED.

28:39.319 --> 28:42.922
COME ON!
COME ON!
HE SAID HE DIED.

28:42.922 --> 28:50.764
AND NOW HE HERE?
OH, MAN.
BREAK THAT DEMON CHILD AWAY FROM

28:50.764 --> 28:52.799
HIM.
I DO NOT LIKE THIS SHOW, MAN!
I DON'T LIKE THESE TALES.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.435
I'M OUT.
I QUIT.
YOU CAN'T QUIT.

28:55.435 --> 28:57.203
I NEED YOU, MAN.
I CAN'T LISTEN TO THESE SPOOKY
STORIES BY MYSELF.

28:57.203 --> 29:05.612
ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE THE NEXT ONE WON'T BE SO
CREEPY.

29:05.612 --> 29:09.916
YEAH, MAYBE.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOO?

29:09.916 --> 29:18.425
OUR LAST GUEST, RAMONA GARRETT
AND HER DAUGHTER -- OH, HELL.
CORALINE.

29:18.425 --> 29:28.702
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS
LITTLE WEDNESDAY ADAM?

29:28.702 --> 29:30.503
YEAH.
SO A FEW MONTHS AGO, CORALINE
STARTED SINGING A SONG I'D NEVER

29:30.503 --> 29:32.305
HEARD.
I SAID, "WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT?"
SHE SAID, "THE OLD LADY WHO

29:32.305 --> 29:35.475
COMES INTO MY ROOM AT NIGHT
AND SHE SAID IT'S HER
IMAGINARY FRIEND.

29:35.475 --> 29:40.180
BUT THEN, WE WERE LOOKING
THROUGH AN OLD FAMILY PHOTO
ALBUM --

29:40.180 --> 29:44.884
NO!
-- AND THERE WAS A PICTURE OF
HER GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHO DIED

29:44.884 --> 29:52.525
15 YEARS AGO.
NO!
AND SHE POINTS TO THE PHOTO

29:52.525 --> 29:56.162
AND SAYS, "THAT'S THE WOMAN WHO
SINGS TO ME AT NIGHT."
WHY?

29:56.162 --> 29:59.866
WHY?
WHAT?
WHAT DO I ALWAYS SAY?

29:59.866 --> 30:06.706
IMAGINARY FRIENDS ARE GHOSTS.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT.

30:06.706 --> 30:09.676
THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW.
WE ARE DONE.
OH, MY GOSH.

30:09.676 --> 30:14.247
WE'RE SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
WAIT.
WHO ARE YOU STARING AT?

30:14.247 --> 30:27.694
WHO ARE YOU STARING AT?
THE MAN IN THE RED JACKET.
[ APPLAUSE ]

30:34.100 --> 30:38.271
MEN SAY THEY HAVE NO CLOSE
FRIENDSHIPS.
AND THREE IN FOUR REPORT

30:38.271 --> 30:41.908
RECEIVING ALL THEIR EMOTIONAL
SUPPORT FROM THEIR WIFE OR
GIRLFRIEND, OFTEN THE MOMENT

30:41.908 --> 30:45.545
THEY COME HOME FROM WORK.

30:45.545 --> 30:47.647

31:00.160 --> 31:04.064
AND ALL THE WORDS COME OUT
FAST AND IN THE WRONG ORDER
BECAUSE HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO

31:04.064 --> 31:07.667
ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THAT.
I NEED YOU TO GO OUT OF THE
HOUSE AND MAKE A FRIEND SO YOU

31:07.667 --> 31:11.104
TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THIS
STUFF AND NOT JUST ME.
THAT'S INSANE.

31:11.104 --> 31:16.309
WHERE WOULD I EVEN GO?
FINALLY, THERE'S A PLACE,
WITH MAN PARK.

31:16.309 --> 31:19.446
IT'S LIKE A DOG PARK, BUT FOR

31:19.446 --> 31:24.117
OUTLET, BESIDES THEIR
GIRLFRIENDS AND WIVES.

31:24.117 --> 31:28.822
RISE AND GRIND.

31:52.245 --> 31:53.813
MARVEL.

NAME, STEVEN K. BANNON, THE "K"
STANDS FOR THREE Ks, WAS
INDICTED THIS WEEK FOR CONTEMPT

44:26.332 --> 44:33.239
OF CONGRESS.
IF CONVICTED, BANNON FACES UP TO
TWO YEARS IN PRISON.

44:33.239 --> 44:38.712
WHICH, FROM THE LOOKS OF HIM,
MIGHT BE A LIFE SENTENCE.
LEGAL EXPERTS ARE SAYING

44:38.712 --> 44:42.349
THAT KYLE RITTENHOUSE CRYING ON
THE STAND AS HE DESCRIBED HOW HE
SHOT HIS VICTIMS WILL HELP HIM

44:42.349 --> 44:50.623
WITH THE JURY.
MAN, IS THERE A WHITE TEARS LAW
SCHOOL THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

44:50.623 --> 44:57.497
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU GUYS CRY
AND EVERYTHING WORKS OUT FOR
YOU,

45:12.479 --> 45:19.753
THEY CHOSE THAT BECAUSE FIVE
PLUS ONE EQUALS SIX.

OFFICIALLY ENDED BRITNEY SPEARS'

WHICH IS NOT TRUE.
I ALSO DRINK.

46:07.033 --> 46:16.042
ELON MUSK SOLD NEARLY $5
MILLION IN TESLA STOCK.
WHICH IS GOOD NEWS BECAUSE THE

46:16.042 --> 46:24.384

DISABILITIES ACT.
BECAUSE IN TEXAS, YOU HAVE TO
TREAT THE DISABLED WITH CARE AND

46:29.422 --> 46:40.066
RESPECT, UNTIL THE DAY YOU
EXECUTE THEM.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I THOUGHT THAT

46:40.066 --> 46:46.906
WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH.
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT NEW YORK
CITY SANTA CON WILL RETURN THIS

46:46.906 --> 46:53.780

47:29.449 --> 47:31.851
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A

I COULD SAY SOMETHING RIGHT NOW

47:31.851 --> 47:34.654

YOURS.
OKAY.

47:34.654 --> 47:38.291
WELL, PLEASE DON'T.
I KIND OF WANT TO.
I'M CRAZY.

47:38.291 --> 47:42.462

ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.
I COULD HAVE A NIP SLIP RIGHT

INVESTIGATING IF THE DEATHS ARE
CONNECTED.
AND SOME ARE BEGINNING TO

52:05.525 --> 52:15.135
SUSPECT THIS COULD BE A WORK OF
NOTORIOUS SERIAL KILLER,
GIRAFFERY DAHMER.

52:15.135 --> 52:18.471
AN 83-YEAR-OLD MAN HAS
BECOME THE OLDEST PERSON EVER TO
HIKE THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL.

52:18.471 --> 52:54.107
THE MAN DEDICATED THIS WALK TO
HIS WIFE, WHO DIED A FEW MILES
BACK.

52:54.107 --> 52:57.143
WELL, GUYS, RECENTLY, SOME
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN USING
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR

52:57.143 --> 53:00.413
ARTISTIC PURSUITS LIKE DANCE,
MUSIC AND PAINTING.
HERE TO COMMENT IS A ROBOT

53:00.413 --> 53:02.349
PROGRAMMED TO DO STANDUP COMEDY,
LAUGHINTOSH 3000.
HELLO, COLIN.

53:02.349 --> 53:11.558
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?
I'M DOING WELL.
WHAT A LOVELY CROWD.

53:11.558 --> 53:14.494
THIS IS CROWD WORK.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

53:14.494 --> 53:26.573
I'M FROM STATEN ISLAND.
STATEN ISLAND.

53:26.573 --> 53:30.577

STATEN ISLAND SUCKS.
AM I RIGHT?

53:30.577 --> 53:34.714
THIS WAS CROWD WORK.
WOW.
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

53:34.714 --> 53:36.149
THAT'S GREAT.
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME
JOKES?

53:36.149 --> 53:39.419
SURE.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
ALL RIGHT.

53:39.419 --> 53:43.790
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLACK
PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE --
WE CAN MAYBE SKIP THAT ONE,

53:43.790 --> 53:50.663
LAUGHINTOSH.
THAT'S OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT SOME IMPRESSIONS?

53:50.663 --> 53:53.466
IMPRESSIONS ARE FUN.
ALL RIGHT.
IMPRESSIONS.

53:53.466 --> 53:55.669
LOADING.
LOADING.
THIS IS MY IMPRESSION OF

53:55.669 --> 53:57.637
INSTAGRAM.
LOOK AT MY FACE.
LOOK AT MY BODY.

53:57.637 --> 54:06.880
LOOK AT MY VACATION.
LOOK AT MY BODY.
THIS WAS INSTAGRAM.

54:06.880 --> 54:09.516
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
IMPRESSION.
THANK YOU.

54:09.516 --> 54:16.056
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHERS?
ANY OTHER IMPRESSIONS?

54:16.056 --> 54:20.060
OKAY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
IMPRESSIONS?

54:20.060 --> 54:25.398

THIS IS MY IMPRESSION OF TINDER.
THIS IS TINDER.

54:25.398 --> 54:27.067
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

54:27.067 --> 54:37.077
HELLO, BABY.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SEX
TONIGHT?

54:37.077 --> 54:38.311

GET OUT OF MY WAY.

54:38.311 --> 54:43.116
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
THIS WAS TINDER.
WOW.

54:43.116 --> 54:59.666
SO, YOU DATE THEN?
THAT'S A VERY SORE SUBJECT.
IT'S VERY HARD TO DATE AS A

54:59.666 --> 55:01.735
ROBOT.
THE LAST GIRLFRIEND I HAD WAS A
GPS.

55:01.735 --> 55:10.577
WHENEVER WE HAD SEX, ALL SHE
WOULD DO IS GIVE ME DIRECTIONS.
GO LEFT.

55:10.577 --> 55:17.684
GO LEFT.
GO LEFT.
LOWER, LOWER.

55:17.684 --> 55:23.256
LOWER.
RECALCULATING.
DESTINATION, NOT REACHED.

55:23.256 --> 55:26.893
THIS WAS MY LOWEST MOMENT.
OH, MAN.
WELL, IT'S OKAY.

55:26.893 --> 55:32.098
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

55:32.098 --> 55:40.373
IT COULD BE WORSE.
I COULD BE FROM STATEN ISLAND,
BABY.

HALLELUJAH.
OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

1:04:20.894 --> 1:04:24.364
AND IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT
IT IN FRONT OF THE CONGREGATION,
NOT BECAUSE IT'S WRONG BUT

1:04:24.364 --> 1:04:33.807
BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY ROMANTICALLY
INTERESTED IN SOMETHINGS.
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY

BEEN NOTIFIED, THE PERFUME

1:05:12.379 --> 1:05:16.049
NO, GEORGE.
YOU'RE JUST CHEATING ON YOUR
WIFE.

1:05:16.049 --> 1:05:23.056

CORRECT.
CORRECT.
JUST SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.

1:05:44.544 --> 1:05:51.117
