00:01.936 --> 00:05.471
¶ On the 82nd day of Christmas
my true love gave to me ¶

00:05.473 --> 00:09.208
¶ 82 cats a-frying 81 a-broiling
80 cats a-baking ¶

00:09.210 --> 00:10.275
(Willie)
'Enough, ALF!'

00:10.277 --> 00:11.443
¶ 79 cats a-toasting ¶

00:11.445 --> 00:12.878
¶ 78 cats a-boiling ¶

00:12.880 --> 00:13.946
(Kate)
'Enough!'

00:13.948 --> 00:15.180
¶ 77 cats a-sizzling ¶

00:15.182 --> 00:17.216
¶ 76 cats a-poaching ¶¶

00:17.218 --> 00:20.386
(everyone)
'Enough, ALF!'

00:20.388 --> 00:22.221
(ALF)
'Not only are we
spending Christmas'

00:22.223 --> 00:25.324
'in some desolate cabin
with no running water'

00:25.326 --> 00:26.825
'we're not allowed to sing.'

00:26.827 --> 00:29.128
(Willie)
'You can sing,
just don't sing about'

00:29.130 --> 00:30.696
'you-know-what.'

00:30.698 --> 00:31.997
(ALF)
'What?'

00:31.999 --> 00:33.832
(Kate)
'Roasting cats.'

00:33.834 --> 00:35.234
(ALF)
'I didn't say roasting.'

00:35.236 --> 00:37.369
'I said frying, boiling,
baking..'

00:37.371 --> 00:39.304
- 'You know what we mean.'
- 'Right.'

00:39.306 --> 00:41.673
(ALF)
'Right, no cat songs.'

00:41.675 --> 00:43.409
(Brian)
'Do you think
there's gonna be snow?'

00:43.411 --> 00:45.744
(Willie)
'Uh, yes. Hopefully.'

00:45.746 --> 00:51.517
(ALF)
'Oh, great. No running water,
no cat songs, and no snow.'

00:51.519 --> 00:54.353
(Willie)
'We should have tied him
to the roof rack.'

00:54.355 --> 00:56.321
(ALF)
'Why are we stopping here?'

00:56.323 --> 01:00.526
(Willie)
'This is it. This is where we
are gonna spend our Christmas.'

01:00.528 --> 01:03.729
(ALF)
'Well, why didn't you
just get a manger?'

01:03.731 --> 01:06.698
- Let's check this out.
- 'You check it out!'

01:06.700 --> 01:09.802
I need to check out
the outdoor plumbing.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.442
[instrumental music]

01:17.912 --> 01:19.244
Well?

01:21.549 --> 01:23.682
Well?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.551
What do you think?

01:25.553 --> 01:28.053
It's, uh..

01:28.055 --> 01:29.221
Rustic.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.722
I think it's neat.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.925
Brian, I was,
I was about your age

01:32.927 --> 01:34.193
when I spent Christmas here

01:34.195 --> 01:37.362
with my whole family.
And I..

01:37.364 --> 01:39.398
I don't think Mr. Foley

01:39.400 --> 01:42.468
I don't think Mr. Foley
has changed a thing.

01:44.405 --> 01:47.539
The kitchen could
use some updating.

01:47.541 --> 01:50.876
Look. Look. This is where we
put our stockings.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.745
A-and the tree was
right over there.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.447
And then on Christmas Eve,
we-we drank

01:55.449 --> 01:57.749
hot apple cider
with cinnamon and sang

01:57.751 --> 02:01.887
Christmas carols until the
wee hours of the morning.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.755
This is gonna be
that sort of Christmas

02:03.757 --> 02:09.094
a Christmas full of warmth
and love, and joy.

02:09.096 --> 02:12.231
(ALF)
'Help, help!
I'm stuck in the outhouse!'

02:14.268 --> 02:16.068
Hold that thought.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.470
[instrumental music]

02:20.441 --> 02:22.508
[instrumental music]

02:24.778 --> 02:27.279
Hey, hey!
Careful with that box, Willie!

02:27.281 --> 02:29.114
That's precious cargo.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.116
Oh, gee!

02:31.118 --> 02:33.018
What's in it?
It's so heavy.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.753
Your color TV.

02:36.790 --> 02:40.626
Well, you said there wouldn't
be any TV up here.

02:40.628 --> 02:44.630
There is no TV because
there is no electricity.

02:44.632 --> 02:49.668
You see, you can't run a TV
without electricity.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.338
Oh, great. There goes
the Perry Como special.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.876
What's in this one?

02:57.878 --> 02:59.478
Your microwave.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.247
But it seems like
a moot point, now.

03:05.486 --> 03:09.021
Well, what happened was
my dad lost his job

03:09.023 --> 03:11.990
and then we lost our house.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.660
- How do you lose a house?
- No, no, no.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.062
We didn't actually
lose the house.

03:17.064 --> 03:20.065
We, we just, we couldn't afford
to make the payments anymore

03:20.067 --> 03:22.401
and we had to get out.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.503
Well, it was
the middle of December.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.673
And we were literally
out in the streets

03:27.675 --> 03:31.843
when Mr. Foley heard
about what happened and

03:31.845 --> 03:34.813
he said that he had this
cabin up in the woods

03:34.815 --> 03:36.715
that he hardly
ever went to

03:36.717 --> 03:40.686
and we could stay there
for as long as we had to.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.488
You know, that Christmas,
we, we had nothing.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.756
We had absolutely nothing.

03:44.758 --> 03:49.228
No presents, no toys.
Nothing.

03:49.230 --> 03:53.198
I think that was the best
Christmas I can remember.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.533
Where was Mr. Foley?

03:54.535 --> 03:56.602
He, he was at his house in town.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.437
I bet it had
indoor plumbing.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.541
So, last month we got a letter
that Margaret was ill

04:02.543 --> 04:04.743
and since they weren't
using the cabin--

04:04.745 --> 04:08.113
You jumped at
the invitation.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.915
We're not
getting through here.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.883
It's just a phase.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.885
[chuckles]

04:13.887 --> 04:15.554
I'm sorry, dad.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.623
I know we're gonna
have a great time.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.728
¶ Deck the dump with
boughs of holly ¶

04:22.730 --> 04:25.464
¶ Fa la la la la lala la la.. ¶

04:25.466 --> 04:28.133
Here you go, Willie,
hang the holly.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.401
Where'd you find this holly?

04:29.403 --> 04:30.936
Out back.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.305
- Oh, I like your sweater.
- Well, thank you.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.374
It's the Perry Como look.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.643
[chuckles]
It's stunning.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.579
You know, it looks a
little like..

04:40.581 --> 04:45.717
It is. It's the Christmas
present I bought for Willie.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.620
- 'Oh!'
- Take off the sweater.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.125
What are you
doing with it?

04:53.127 --> 04:57.062
Wearing it! I looked pretty
silly in your new robe.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.731
Honey, did you get me a robe?

04:59.733 --> 05:02.901
- Apparently.
- What do you mean apparently?

05:02.903 --> 05:06.305
It's right in that box
next to Brian's bicycle.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.607
I get a bike
for Christmas?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.375
Oh, boy!

05:12.179 --> 05:14.012
- Can I have it now?
- No, no.

05:14.014 --> 05:17.115
Son, you can wait till
Christmas morning, can't you?

05:17.117 --> 05:18.817
Okay.

05:19.787 --> 05:23.121
ALF, these are Christmas
presents

05:23.123 --> 05:26.358
they're supposed to be opened
on Christmas day.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.627
And they're supposed
to be surprises.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.962
And they're not from
you, anyway!

05:30.964 --> 05:33.699
Sure they are!
Look at the tags.

05:35.269 --> 05:36.535
"To Willie, from ALF."

05:36.537 --> 05:38.370
"To Kate, from ALF."

05:38.372 --> 05:39.604
"To Lynn, from ALF."

05:39.606 --> 05:40.706
"To ALF, from ALF."

05:40.708 --> 05:42.441
"To Brian, from ALF."

05:42.443 --> 05:44.309
Did you change these tags?

05:44.311 --> 05:46.378
When do I have
time to shop?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.548
He changed the tags

05:49.550 --> 05:51.783
he put his name
on Brian's bicycle

05:51.785 --> 05:54.019
and then told him
what it was.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.521
Well, I didn't tell
him it's red.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.457
It's red?

05:58.459 --> 06:01.626
I just said that to
throw him off the track.

06:01.628 --> 06:04.830
Well, what do you mean he is
getting a red bicycle?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.231
Not exactly.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.067
As you and I know,
it's a bicycle kit.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.837
Uh, some assembly
is required. Yes.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.840
Some assembly?
Have you read the instructions?

06:14.842 --> 06:18.243
What is required is a pair of
pliers, a screw driver..

06:18.245 --> 06:21.747
And someone who has a vague idea
of what they're doing.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.085
I think I'll
hang the holly.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.854
Dad, wait.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.989
I don't think that's holly.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.357
Well, what is it then?

06:32.359 --> 06:34.092
I think it's poison oak.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.765
Kate.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.734
Is this poison oak?

06:42.736 --> 06:47.439
Well, I-I don't know, honey.
Brian's the Cub Scout.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.707
How can you tell?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.208
Elementary, Willie!

06:50.210 --> 06:52.577
Once a week, the kid
puts on a blue uniform

06:52.579 --> 06:54.112
and goes to a meeting.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.749
Are you finished?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.786
Uh, unless I hear laughter
in the next few seconds.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.356
I withdraw
the Cub Scout joke.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.024
Go on with your life.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.196
What makes you think
this is poison oak, B?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.965
Well, it has three leaves.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.635
Kate, start pumping.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.308
Running water
would come in handy now

07:23.310 --> 07:24.709
wouldn't it, Wilco?

07:24.711 --> 07:26.745
You don't understand, do you?
You just..

07:26.747 --> 07:29.915
You don't understand anything
about Christmas, do you?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.883
'You think it's just
opening presents'

07:31.885 --> 07:33.418
and being a general nuisance.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.387
- Well, honey, I don't think..
- Well, isn't it time..

07:35.389 --> 07:36.721
Isn't it about time that he had

07:36.723 --> 07:39.825
a little consideration
for rest of us?

07:39.827 --> 07:41.460
Now, take that poison oak

07:41.462 --> 07:43.995
and dump it
way out in the woods.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.633
[mellow music]

07:53.307 --> 07:55.073
And don't hurry back!

08:06.954 --> 08:08.186
[door slams]

08:22.302 --> 08:25.203
This, Brian and Lynn

08:25.205 --> 08:27.506
this is Mr. Foley.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.107
- Hi.
- Hi. How're you doing?

08:29.109 --> 08:32.310
(Lynn)
'Hi, Mr. Foley.
It's nice to meet you.'

08:32.312 --> 08:34.379
Now, we were just thinking about
fixing something to eat.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.480
Won't you stay with us?

08:35.482 --> 08:36.982
Oh. No, thank you, Mrs. Tanner.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.484
I was just on my way to deliver
a truck full of toys

08:39.486 --> 08:42.020
to the hospital and I thought
I'd stopped by to see

08:42.022 --> 08:44.689
if you need anything in town.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.158
Truck full of toys?

08:47.160 --> 08:51.530
You know, every year,
Mr. Foley repairs toys

08:51.532 --> 08:53.131
that children have
thrown away.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.202
And on Christmas Eve, he takes
them into town, to the hospital

08:57.204 --> 08:58.303
and he gives them out..

08:58.305 --> 09:00.205
Oh, no, not quite, Willie.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.741
You see, I deliver the toys
to Santa Claus

09:02.743 --> 09:05.810
and he gives them
to the children in the hospital.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.019
Wow!

09:14.021 --> 09:18.490
Now, tell me, how is Mrs. Foley,
any better?

09:18.492 --> 09:21.560
Well, I mustn't keep
Santa Claus waiting.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.094
Good day.

09:27.267 --> 09:32.404
Whoa! A replica
of a Batu spaceship!

09:32.406 --> 09:34.172
Perfect for Brian.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.578
Doesn't fly.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.546
(Kate)
Wait. Mr. Foley..

09:41.548 --> 09:43.048
(Willie)
Mr. Foley..

09:43.050 --> 09:46.384
Is, is there anything wrong?
I mean..

09:46.386 --> 09:50.922
Oh, oh, I almost forgot
your Christmas present.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.924
- Oh.
- Now, promise me..

09:52.926 --> 09:55.560
You won't open it
until Christmas day. Eh?

09:55.562 --> 09:57.729
- Yeah. Hey.
- Gosh.

09:57.731 --> 10:01.399
A rolling cat-Platter!

10:01.401 --> 10:03.435
Perfect for Lucky.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.270
I'll give it to Kate.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.442
[door slams]

10:10.444 --> 10:11.810
Uh-oh.

10:12.879 --> 10:15.747
Margaret passed away
two weeks ago.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.850
I didn't have time
to write everybody.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.822
Oh, Mr. Foley..

10:23.824 --> 10:26.992
Mr. Foley,
we're so sorry.

10:32.799 --> 10:37.602
Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas, everybody.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.270
[laughs]

10:39.272 --> 10:41.272
Come on out.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.742
Follow me. That's it.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.910
Yeah. Let's sing a song.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.980
¶ You better watch out
you better not cry ¶

10:48.982 --> 10:52.083
¶ You better not pout
I'm telling you why ¶

10:52.085 --> 10:55.620
¶ Santa Claus
is coming to town ¶

10:55.622 --> 10:57.188
Come on, once again!

10:57.190 --> 11:00.325
¶ You better watch out
you better not cry ¶

11:00.327 --> 11:02.627
¶ Better not pout
I'm telling you why... ¶

11:02.629 --> 11:04.929
[instrumental music]

11:10.270 --> 11:11.302
[instrumental music]

11:11.304 --> 11:14.039
(Santa)
You two look like brothers.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.540
You are?

11:15.542 --> 11:17.676
How about sharing this?

11:17.678 --> 11:20.478
[indistinct chatter]

11:20.480 --> 11:22.647
Okay? Merry Christmas.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.649
Merry Christmas.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.785
Well, now, what is your name?

11:26.787 --> 11:29.020
- Katie.
- Katie.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.990
Katie, I have something for you.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.325
It's cute as you,
it looks like you.

11:34.327 --> 11:38.163
You have a Merry Christmas,
Katie. Oh. Ha-ha!

11:38.165 --> 11:39.964
I want the bat,
the ball and the mitt.

11:39.966 --> 11:43.134
Oh, I'm sorry,
one to a customer.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.703
Then just the ball and the mitt.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.671
Mm-hm.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.673
Well, now,
what's your name, son?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.175
- James.
- Well, James.

11:50.177 --> 11:54.145
I got a bat and this
funny-looking thing.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.749
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.919
- Pass.
- Hm.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.723
Hey, I don't remember
bringing this in here.

12:04.725 --> 12:08.693
Sure is an ugly-looking thing.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.396
Got big ugly ears,
big ugly eyes..

12:11.398 --> 12:13.765
I think she's beautiful.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.439
She's heavier
than she looks.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.877
Thank you, Santa.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.279
Oh, you're welcome, darling.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.751
I wish I had a present
to give you.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.519
Oh, that's okay.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.888
You know, Christmas
isn't about presents.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.190
It's about giving of
yourself.

12:39.192 --> 12:43.495
You've given me a most wonderful
gift by saying "thank you."

12:54.574 --> 12:56.474
I'm going to name her Amanda.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.650
My name is Tiffany
and I'm 8 years old.

13:05.652 --> 13:08.153
How old are you, Amanda?

13:08.155 --> 13:11.923
You're 8 years old, too?
That's great.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.725
Would you like to
put your feet up?

13:13.727 --> 13:15.994
You would? Okay.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.333
[whirring]

13:31.011 --> 13:32.443
Tiffany, hop into your bed.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.913
It's time to take your
temperature.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.152
Okay. But Amanda wants you to
take her temperature first.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.021
Amanda?

13:43.023 --> 13:46.024
Oh, hello. Welcome.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.629
Let's see if I have an extra
thermometer with me.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.531
Oh. Here we go.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.768
'Okay, Amanda.
This won't hurt a bit.'

13:56.770 --> 13:58.002
Now, open up.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.276
'Okay. Now, let's take
Tiffany's temperature.'

14:20.827 --> 14:22.427
'Thank you.'

14:27.834 --> 14:30.368
- Goodnight, Tiffany.
- Goodnight

14:32.005 --> 14:34.038
Goodnight, Amanda.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.090
Amanda, dear, do come in.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.992
I'm so glad you could come
to visit to see me.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.927
'Cause we have so much
to talk about.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.263
Would you care for
tea and cookies?

15:00.867 --> 15:03.534
I find that everyone in the
hospital is very nice

15:03.536 --> 15:06.771
except they're all too busy
to really talk to.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.640
Here, let me serve you.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.546
Yes, they are very good.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.282
I made them myself.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.624
Who's your favorite TV star?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.695
Mine, too!
He's such a hunk.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.764
We have so much in common.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.403
Yes, there used to
be another girl here

15:38.405 --> 15:40.772
but they moved her
to a different room.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.774
Her mother was afraid
she might get depressed

15:42.776 --> 15:45.276
if we became friends, and..

15:49.115 --> 15:52.116
Know what you need, Amanda?
Earrings.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.885
Here's a beautiful pair.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.253
They'll look
fabulous on you.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.989
Pink is definitely
your color.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.324
- Hold it.
- Huh!

15:59.326 --> 16:02.894
This where I
draw the line.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.929
I've got to
level with you, kid.

16:04.931 --> 16:08.633
My name is ALF,
not Amanda.

16:08.635 --> 16:13.137
And, and blue is my color.
I'm a boy.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.273
You can talk!

16:15.275 --> 16:17.976
Yeah, and it's
a good thing

16:17.978 --> 16:21.346
or you'd have me wearing
a bra by now.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.815
Mind if I have
another cookie?

16:28.621 --> 16:29.921
This is fantastic!

16:29.923 --> 16:32.857
A stuffed animal that talks
and eats cookies.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.792
I've got to show
nurse Hilliard.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.794
Oh, no, no, please!

16:36.796 --> 16:39.464
Don't tell anyone.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.966
Why not?

16:41.968 --> 16:45.803
Well, because I'm not
a stuffed toy.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.538
I'm real.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.141
And I'm in danger.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.111
You've got to
help me get home.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.013
But Santa
gave you to me.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.547
Your mine.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.819
I guess I better explain.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.354
Come here.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.325
Yeah, this is all I got left,
Tiffany.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.694
I like him better than Amanda.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.063
Are you sure?

17:12.065 --> 17:14.832
Yeah, next year
you can give Amanda

17:14.834 --> 17:18.369
to another little girl,
one who's not so fussy.

17:20.507 --> 17:24.042
Well, you can have both
toys if you'd like.

17:24.044 --> 17:28.146
No, I'm bored with him,
I mean her.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.415
Thanks anyway, Santa.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.231
Excuse me, Dr. Willoughby,
are you busy?

17:47.233 --> 17:50.668
George, I mean Santa.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.371
I just thought I'd stop by to
wish you a Merry Christmas

17:53.373 --> 17:58.042
and, uh, to give you this
for the hospital.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.210
'It's not much.'

17:59.212 --> 18:00.678
Well, thank you, George.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.382
Thank you very much.
Merry Christmas to you, too.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.751
Where should I
send your receipt?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.453
Uh, don't bother.

18:08.455 --> 18:12.223
Don't open it
until tomorrow.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.092
Did you give out
all those presents?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.561
Well, all except
for that oddball.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.597
Tiffany took it and
then she gave it back.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.299
[laughing]

18:21.301 --> 18:24.535
Well, all she really wanted was
to see you for Christmas.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.404
One of the other little kids
told her there's no such thing

18:26.406 --> 18:29.307
as Santa and then she
asked me if it was true.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.476
- Well..
- What did you tell her?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.278
Well..

18:34.280 --> 18:36.814
I showed her this.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.649
Hm.

18:38.651 --> 18:43.321
"Yes, Virginia,
there is a Santa Claus."

18:43.323 --> 18:46.491
The most famous newspaper
editorial of all time.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.927
"He exists as certainly
as love and generosity

18:49.929 --> 18:52.230
"and devotion exists.

18:52.232 --> 18:56.934
"How dreary would be the world
if there were no Santa Claus.

18:56.936 --> 19:01.606
"It would be as dreary as
if there were no Virginias.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.909
"There would be no
child-like faith then

19:04.911 --> 19:06.811
"no poetry,
no romance

19:06.813 --> 19:09.847
"to make tolerable
this existence.

19:09.849 --> 19:14.752
"The eternal light with which
childhood fills the world

19:14.754 --> 19:16.754
would be extinguished."

19:23.596 --> 19:24.762
Tiffany?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.264
Yeah.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.001
I can't do
anything for her.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.312
What do you suppose
to say to a little girl

19:41.314 --> 19:43.781
who's not gonna see
another Christmas?

19:57.163 --> 19:58.896
ALF!

19:58.898 --> 20:00.731
Shhh!

20:02.068 --> 20:03.834
I thought you had to leave.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.403
Well, yeah, yeah.

20:05.405 --> 20:09.140
I, uh, I-I do.
I do.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.841
You came back to see me?

20:10.843 --> 20:14.912
Yeah. I wanted to wish you
a Merry Christmas.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.581
Merry Christmas, ALF.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.817
And to see if you
had any more of those cookies.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.052
You ate them all.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.753
Oh, right.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.792
I drew a picture of you.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.201
This is me?

20:37.203 --> 20:39.270
Pretty good, huh?

20:39.272 --> 20:41.572
Well, where's my nose?

20:41.574 --> 20:44.075
I didn't have enough
room on the page.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.246
Who's this?

20:48.248 --> 20:49.280
It's me.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.982
Can't you tell?

20:54.220 --> 20:55.886
You're wearing wings.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.422
Uh-huh.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.726
You're not from the planet
Bungaraya, are you?

21:01.728 --> 21:03.261
No.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.531
I'm from earth.
The wings are just..

21:07.533 --> 21:08.966
They're beautiful.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.606
ALF, do you ever miss Melmac?

21:17.577 --> 21:19.310
Yeah.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.845
I miss it a lot.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.482
It was my whole world.

21:24.484 --> 21:28.452
Everything and everybody
I knew was there.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.924
What do you
miss the most?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.059
My friends.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.263
That's what I thought.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.899
But, but when I came
to this world

21:41.901 --> 21:43.467
I made new friends.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.804
Like, like the people
I live with

21:46.806 --> 21:48.806
and you, Tiffany.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.275
and I discovered a lot of
new things on this world.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.778
that we didn't have on Melmac.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.945
Like what?

21:54.947 --> 22:00.017
Like, uh, pavement
and, uh, silverware.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.753
What about Christmas?

22:02.755 --> 22:06.257
I don't really have a handle
on Christmas yet.

22:06.259 --> 22:09.460
People get uptight
about presents.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.429
That's because they
just don't know.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.532
Know what?

22:14.534 --> 22:17.268
Christmas isn't
about presents.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.303
It's about giving
of yourself.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.572
That's what
Santa Claus said.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.712
After meeting you,
I know what he means.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.051
[mellow music]

22:38.825 --> 22:43.561
ALF, are you really
from way out there?

22:43.563 --> 22:46.697
(ALF)
'Yeah. Somewhere out there.'

22:51.571 --> 22:53.971
Kate, look at this.

22:56.576 --> 23:00.311
Dad, you shouldn't open
that till Christmas.

23:00.313 --> 23:03.047
Oh. That was an accident.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.851
Honey, it's, it's the deed
to this cabin.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.387
He says, "I hope your family
will enjoy many more

23:09.389 --> 23:12.423
Christmases here
at this cabin."

23:12.425 --> 23:15.426
We can't accept
a gift of this cabin.

23:15.428 --> 23:18.095
Why not?
This place is neat.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.697
I want to live here.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.533
- Don't you, Lynn?
- Huh? Oh, sure.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.403
No! No, no, I mean I don't want
to live here.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.906
An occasional visit, you know
in the area, t-that's fine but--

23:28.908 --> 23:32.109
Mr. Foley hardly knows me.
Uh..

23:32.111 --> 23:33.778
What can he be thinking of?

23:35.348 --> 23:37.248
Has anyone seen ALF?

23:40.052 --> 23:41.619
ALF..

23:46.359 --> 23:48.559
ALF, could you stay with me

23:48.561 --> 23:50.561
just until I fall asleep?

23:50.563 --> 23:52.963
Hey, no problem.

23:58.971 --> 24:03.073
ALF, do you want to
know a secret?

24:03.075 --> 24:06.577
If you want
to tell me.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.747
I'm going to have to move on
to another world, too.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.616
And there's nothing anyone
can do about it.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.553
And I'm afraid to go, ALF.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.655
I know I'm not supposed
to be afraid

24:17.657 --> 24:19.890
but I can't help it.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.495
It's alright, Tiffany.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.131
It's alright to be afraid.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.967
I'm so afraid I can't
go to sleep at night

24:29.969 --> 24:32.403
because I'm afraid
I'm not gonna wake up.

24:32.405 --> 24:35.439
Well, then, do what I do.

24:35.441 --> 24:37.441
When you can't go to sleep

24:37.443 --> 24:40.945
think about some of your
favorite things.

24:40.947 --> 24:44.114
You mean, like rain drops
on rose?

24:44.116 --> 24:46.450
Yeah, that's a good one.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.152
Or whiskers on kittens.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.087
Ha! Now, you're talkin'.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.889
[smacking lips]

24:55.361 --> 24:59.864
You know, maybe in the next
world that I'm going to

24:59.866 --> 25:02.967
they'll have Christmas
all year round.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.169
Could be.

25:05.171 --> 25:09.473
And everyone will
want to be my friend.

25:09.475 --> 25:12.276
I know they will.

25:12.278 --> 25:16.013
And maybe everyone will be
just like you, ALF.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.283
Well, there is
such a thing as

25:19.285 --> 25:21.118
too much of
a good thing.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.620
Hah!

25:24.390 --> 25:26.056
I love you, ALF.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.960
[mellow music]

25:34.333 --> 25:36.767
I love you too, Tiffany.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.166
[mellow music]

26:16.409 --> 26:17.975
(Brian)
ALF?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.116
(Kate)
ALF?

Oh! Boy, it's getting cold.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.291
Y-you'd better
go back to the house.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.894
I-I'll keep looking.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.730
I don't want to quit
till we find ALF.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.966
But.. Say, you've got
to stay warm.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.735
You know Alf's got a fur coat,
you don't.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.537
But, dad, what if he gets
caught in a trap

26:46.539 --> 26:49.239
or, or if a hunter shoots him?

26:49.241 --> 26:52.242
Oh, ALF's been around.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.410
Yeah.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.246
He's had a good life.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.916
What we mean is

26:58.918 --> 27:02.653
I'm sure ALF knows
how to stay under cover.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.221
I hope.

[instrumental music]

27:20.439 --> 27:23.407
Okay, men, cover me.

stopwatch, cassette player

27:56.809 --> 27:58.475
What about me?

27:58.477 --> 28:01.345
Oh, my God, Denise!

28:01.347 --> 28:03.447
Come on, sweetheart.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.886
(Dr. Willoughby)
You should have an easy time,
Denise. You're well into labor.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.221
So, we'll just sending you
straight to the delivery room.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.123
- So, everything's okay?
- Everything's fine.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.825
You're going to deliver
the baby now?

28:14.827 --> 28:16.827
- Pretty soon.
- What about the breathing?

28:16.829 --> 28:18.295
Don't we get to
do the breathing?

28:18.297 --> 28:21.398
Well, yeah, we all have to
continue breathing, of course.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.669
(Richard)
'But doctor,
you don't understand.'

28:25.671 --> 28:27.471
We've been going to classes
for months practicing

28:27.473 --> 28:28.839
the breathing, you know.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.974

28:39.652 --> 28:42.186
Yes, Richard, I know, but,
see the breathing exercises

28:42.188 --> 28:44.521
are primarily intended
to help the mother.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.523
Get through the, the..

28:46.525 --> 28:48.058
Hours of excruciating agony?

28:48.060 --> 28:50.527
- Exactly.
- Well, uh..

28:50.529 --> 28:52.196
I'm still gonna be able to watch
the delivery, aren't I?

28:52.198 --> 28:53.897
I mean, I really want to be
a part of everything.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.700
You can cut
the umbilical cord.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.569
Uh, not that.

29:00.272 --> 29:03.207
We need an IM
with 10 milligrams diazepam.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.209
No. No sedative or pain-killers.

29:05.211 --> 29:08.345
I want to be completely awake
and aware of everything.

29:10.883 --> 29:14.852
- It's for him.
- Oh. I'm sorry, doctor.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.421
I swear, he's not
usually like this.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.856
Oh, not now, Richard!

29:18.858 --> 29:21.291
Kelly, could you help Richard
get his equipment inside?

29:21.293 --> 29:25.095
I'm gonna go on the scrub
while Denise is in prep.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.065
- I need my light meter.
- 'Wait, Richard!'

29:28.067 --> 29:30.434
- The elevator!
- Denise!

29:36.809 --> 29:38.942

What happened?

29:39.979 --> 29:42.212
The elevator's stuck.

29:42.214 --> 29:45.749
Help me!
Somebody help me!

29:45.751 --> 29:48.418
Denise! Denise!

29:48.420 --> 29:49.419
Call maintenance, quickly.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.255
Oh, I think
they've all gone home.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.090
See if Mr. Foley is still
around, maybe he can can fix it.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.993
Yes, doctor. Oh, uh,
what does he look like?

29:55.995 --> 29:57.928
- Red suit, white beard.
- Santa Claus?

29:57.930 --> 29:59.096
Right.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.632

30:10.776 --> 30:13.477
- Help is on the way.
- Denise.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.346
George, elevator's stuck.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.015
Yeah.

30:22.621 --> 30:26.123
Somebody, please help me.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.425

30:47.479 --> 30:50.013
Really, that's starting to
get on my nerves.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.516
I told them no drugs.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.853
You're not on drugs.
Now, just relax while I--

30:55.855 --> 30:59.389
- You're a doctor?
- Yes, uh, from Melmac.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.459
The, uh, Melmac clinic
in Minneapolis.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.161
I never heard of it.

31:04.163 --> 31:07.164
Uh, Denise, we're stuck
in an elevator here.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.033
Now is not the time to
question my credentials.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.670
Now I suggest you calm down,
okay?

31:13.672 --> 31:15.672
- Okay.
- Good.

31:15.674 --> 31:19.343
Now, uh, what seems to
be the problem?

31:19.345 --> 31:21.178
The problem?

31:21.180 --> 31:23.080
I'm gonna have a baby.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.149
I see.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.118
Did you get a
second opinion?

31:29.688 --> 31:34.358
Hey, hey, just covering myself
on this malpractice issue.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.593
Please, doctor, would just
tell me what to do?

31:36.595 --> 31:40.364
'No problem, I just need to ask
you a couple of questions.'

31:40.366 --> 31:43.033
Okay. What?

31:43.035 --> 31:45.936
Exactly where do
babies come from?

31:45.938 --> 31:49.006
How can a doctor
not know where babies come from?

31:49.008 --> 31:51.708
Hey, I'm not married.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.745
Well, you might get in the
elevator through the trapdoor

31:54.747 --> 31:56.747
on the ceiling.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.582

and don't push."

32:15.634 --> 32:17.534
It's happening.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.636

No wonder there's

32:52.004 --> 32:55.739
You're the cutest
baby in the whole world.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.708
Yes, you are.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.580
Dr. Shumway,
if you hadn't been here..

33:05.351 --> 33:07.617
I don't know
how to thank you.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.186
You just did.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.788
You said, "thank you."

33:11.790 --> 33:14.191
Merry Christmas.

33:14.193 --> 33:17.561
Of course, you could
name the baby after me.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.532
Isn't Gordon
an unusual name for a girl?

33:23.769 --> 33:25.202
A girl!

33:25.204 --> 33:27.471
Didn't you notice?

33:27.473 --> 33:30.107
Oh, uh.. Oh, yeah,
yeah, of course!

33:30.109 --> 33:32.309
Of course.
I just forgot.

pretty little baby.

33:43.322 --> 33:46.356
How about Tiffany?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.225
Tiffany?

33:48.227 --> 33:50.427
That's a nice name!

34:10.749 --> 34:12.315
What?

34:13.852 --> 34:16.053
Oh, yeah. W-what is it?

34:16.055 --> 34:18.388
I want to talk
to you about this.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.690
You weren't supposed to
open that until tomorrow.

34:20.692 --> 34:24.661
This must be your
whole life savings.

34:24.663 --> 34:28.932
Well, it was, uh..
It was a tax refund.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.535
Mr. Foley, nobody has tax
refunds like this.

34:31.537 --> 34:32.869
And when people get contribution

34:32.871 --> 34:34.604
they're usually in round numbers

34:34.606 --> 34:37.207
$100, $1,000..

34:37.209 --> 34:39.876
I want to discuss this further.

I want you to come by to
see me day after tomorrow.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.549
I've got other plans.

lose a loved one..

35:50.983 --> 35:52.649
He's coming home.

35:54.286 --> 35:57.354
I'm sure he's coming home.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.903
You made it possible for Brian
Tanner to experience a Christmas

40:06.905 --> 40:10.874
like the one his father has
remembered his whole life.

40:10.876 --> 40:14.210
You brought toys
to the hospital

40:14.212 --> 40:18.248
and you brought a smile to
the face of a dying child.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.719
Whether you
know it or not, George

40:22.721 --> 40:25.622
'you've been making other
people happy all your life.'

40:26.758 --> 40:29.893
How do you know
all these things?

40:29.895 --> 40:33.463
Hey, St. Nicholas
knows everything.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.532
I know when
you're sleeping.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.734
I know when
you're awake.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.603
I know if you've
been bad or good.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.139
You know,
the whole ball of wax.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.677
Then you know why
I can't go on anymore.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.449
Margaret is gone.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.950
I'm sorry.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.554
You feel like you
lost your whole world.

40:58.723 --> 41:01.491
Believe me,
I can relate.

41:02.594 --> 41:05.495
But you have
unfinished business here.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.764
There are people
you're leaving behind

41:07.766 --> 41:09.799
who still need you.

41:11.603 --> 41:14.404
And if you know anything
about Christmas, George

41:14.406 --> 41:16.239
you'd know this.

41:16.241 --> 41:20.109
Christmas is not
about what you can get

41:20.111 --> 41:22.679
but what you can
give of yourself.

41:23.949 --> 41:26.282
A little girl
taught me that

41:26.284 --> 41:28.651
not so long ago.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.887
'And I don't know
where she got it.'

41:33.658 --> 41:35.825
You're a good man, Foley.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.795
And I can't afford
to lose you.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.097
So, let's get this
truck on the road.

41:43.702 --> 41:46.569
Come on! We've got
things to do.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.875
[mellow music]

42:06.958 --> 42:08.057
Where to?

42:08.059 --> 42:09.993
Take me home.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.528
North Pole?

42:11.530 --> 42:14.030
I don't think
I have enough gas.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.966
Then take me to see
Willie Tanner.

42:16.968 --> 42:20.136
I've been thinking
about recruiting him.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.305
He has a lot
of potential.

42:22.307 --> 42:27.710
Oh, great. I've always wanted to
see how you go down a chimney.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.612
Yeah, me too.

42:41.493 --> 42:43.693
Merry Christmas, Nick.

42:43.695 --> 42:46.362
And to all a good night.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.131
Good night.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.235
[instrumental music]

43:08.520 --> 43:11.020
- Thanks, mom.
- You're welcome.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.724
Hot cocoa?

43:14.726 --> 43:17.560
This is the worst Christmas
ever!

43:17.562 --> 43:19.295
[sighs]

43:23.368 --> 43:25.702
I hear something
on the roof.

43:25.704 --> 43:27.270
Santa Claus?

43:28.807 --> 43:30.974
Probably not.

43:30.976 --> 43:33.943
I-I didn't hear
any sleigh bells.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.846
Well, here goes nothing.

43:41.419 --> 43:43.486
It is Santa!

43:43.488 --> 43:44.721
It couldn't be!

43:44.723 --> 43:45.822
Maybe it's a raccoon.

43:45.824 --> 43:48.291
- Willie, Willie!
- Hm? Hm?

43:48.293 --> 43:51.327
[ALF screaming]

43:54.432 --> 43:56.633
- It's ALF!
- ALF!

43:56.635 --> 43:58.835
Merry Christmas.

44:08.446 --> 44:10.413
You do look so familiar.

44:10.415 --> 44:12.248
And your voice is so familiar.

44:12.250 --> 44:14.784
I guess you must
remind me of someone else.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.819
Would you care for
some tea and cookies?

44:16.821 --> 44:18.755
Uh, thank you.

44:18.757 --> 44:20.957
Uh, perhaps a little bit later.

44:20.959 --> 44:22.792
Right now I got
so much work here

44:22.794 --> 44:25.495
I don't know what to do.

44:25.497 --> 44:28.698
Unless I delegate
responsibility.

44:28.700 --> 44:30.933
How'd you like to
be my assistant?

44:30.935 --> 44:33.302
What can I do?

44:33.304 --> 44:36.305
Uh, how about getting
me that crescent wrench?

44:36.307 --> 44:38.241
No problem.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.178
Uh..

44:43.448 --> 44:45.248
It's close enough.

44:50.121 --> 44:52.021
- Tiffany?
- 'Yeah?'

44:52.023 --> 44:54.190
Hi. We're the Tanners.

44:54.192 --> 45:00.363
I think we have, um,
a mutual friend.

45:00.365 --> 45:04.033
- ALF!
- Shhh!

45:04.035 --> 45:06.669
(Brian)
Hi, I'm Brian.

45:06.671 --> 45:07.870
These are for you.

45:07.872 --> 45:11.507
- Hello, Willie.
- Mr. Foley!

45:11.509 --> 45:12.975
Say, um..

45:12.977 --> 45:14.844
Could I talk to you just,
just for a minute?

45:14.846 --> 45:16.345
Well, sure.

45:16.347 --> 45:17.914
[grunts]

45:19.718 --> 45:21.451
Listen, um..

45:23.154 --> 45:25.855
Um, it's not that we
don't appreciate this

45:25.857 --> 45:28.191
because we do,
we really, really do.

45:28.193 --> 45:30.426
And we can't thank you enough.

45:30.428 --> 45:32.528
It's just that, um

45:32.530 --> 45:35.498
I-I don't think we'd be
able to use it all that often.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.266
It's a beautiful cabin, but--

45:37.268 --> 45:41.704
In other words,
you've got a tax problem.

45:41.706 --> 45:44.373
- Uh, potentially.
- Hm.

45:44.375 --> 45:47.076
Then I'll just
hang on to this

45:47.078 --> 45:51.447
and invite you
all back next year. Huh?

45:51.449 --> 45:53.549
[chuckles]

45:53.551 --> 45:56.152
You might want to
look out the window.

46:03.795 --> 46:05.995
<i> ["Silent Night" vocalizing]</i>

46:16.241 --> 46:20.243
(Mr. Foley)
'"Yes, Virginia,
there is a Santa Claus.'

46:20.245 --> 46:23.112
'"He exists as certainly
as love and generosity'

46:23.114 --> 46:25.248
'"and devotion exist.'

46:25.250 --> 46:29.418
'"How dreary would be the world
if there were no Santa Claus.'

46:29.420 --> 46:32.989
'"It would be as dreary as
if there were no Virginias.'

46:32.991 --> 46:36.092
'"There would be no
child-like faith, then'

46:36.094 --> 46:38.261
'"no poetry, no romance'

46:38.263 --> 46:41.330
'"to make tolerable
this existence.'

46:41.332 --> 46:45.935
'"Eternal light, with which
childhood fills the world'

46:45.937 --> 46:47.970
'would be extinguished."'
