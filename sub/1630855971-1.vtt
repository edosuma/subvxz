00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:40.916

[Pete] Are you talking to her?

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.958
Okay. Well, what you need to remember
is that, you know,

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:53.500
we're not Purdue Pharma.

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:54.958
We didn't kill America.

This is 2011, and strictly speaking,
we weren't even part of the opioid crisis.

You know, Lonafen was never a street drug.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.916
But, you know, people hear "fentanyl"

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.291
and, you know,
they lose all fucking perspective.

{\an8}You wanna know who did fentanyl?

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:16.416
{\an8}Your mother.
And let me tell you, it saved my bacon

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.750
when Liza, like, blew out my pelvis
with her giant baby head.

{\an8}On the one hand, there were times
I wanted her to die in a plane crash,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.208
and other times
where I wished she would die

00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.875
in a slower, more painful way.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:40.208
Look, the thing about Liza is,
she didn't give a fuck...

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.500
about anybody.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.208

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.541
- Forty years we were married...
- Wow.

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:19.208
...and Zanna was a breath of life for me.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.291
She truly was.

00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:22.375
Yeah.

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.250
But then she was diagnosed
with liver cancer,

00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:28.625
and although I could accept
that she would die...

00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:33.291
the fact that she was gonna die
not only in pain,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.291
but in fear of pain,

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:37.541
that I could not accept.

00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.166
So that's why I developed Lonafen,

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.000
so I can give other cancer patients

00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:45.666
the kind of help
that I could not give my own wife.

00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:47.958
Right.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:51.375
Full disclosure, you're gonna be
joining a doomed endeavor.

00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:54.125
- Oh!
- Yeah. No regrets.

00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:56.208
If we must sink the ship, as it appears,

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:58.750
all we got to do is aim it to an iceberg
that we believe in.

00:19:58.833 --> 00:19:59.875
[chuckles nervously]

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:04.958
In any case, I... couldn't be in the hands
of a better skipper than Captain Pete.

00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.041
Thank you, sir.

00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:07.833
[Jack] You're welcome.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:11.166
Well... I mean, here's my résumé,
if you want it.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.416
- We don't need that.
- [Liza chuckles]

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.708
- Awesome. Okay.
- All right.

00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:16.791
So I'm in?

00:20:17.625 --> 00:20:19.375
- You're in.
- I'll see you around.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Okay, boss.

00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:23.125
- You're gonna do just fine.
- Thank you.

00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:24.875

- Thank you, sir.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.375

- What do you think? I'm in sales.
- This wonder drug is morphine?

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:34.809
- Souped-up aspirin?
- Hold on.

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.625
- Hey, Brent.
- Hi. I'm Liza Drake.

00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:39.708
Uh, Pete shoulda told ya,
we're under a hiring freeze.

00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:41.958

00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:43.458
Uh...

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:45.458

00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:48.916

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:50.958
One week to what?

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:52.541
Invent a doctor.

00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:54.208
Invent a doctor. What does that mean?

00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:57.291
Get a doctor to prescribe your drug.
Just one script.

00:20:57.375 --> 00:20:58.375
And if I don't?

00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.916
- Then you're fired.
- Great, so zero job security.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.642
the base pay's half what I make temping...

00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:05.500

00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:10.125
- What?
- 40 grand.

- A year?
- A month.

[cash register dings]

00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:16.791
I can commission
48 grand a year on one patient?

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:18.458
Or half a mil on ten.

00:21:18.541 --> 00:21:19.666
Is that real?

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.000
It's up to you. You eat what you kill.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.958
It's a long-odds lottery ticket
buried under a thousand rejections,

00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:29.166
and you gotta have the grit and the balls
to reach down and scratch it.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.250
I get it.

[woman] Lonafen
is a revolutionary medication

00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:41.416
for the treatment
of breakthrough cancer pain.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.666
A two-year independent clinical trial
out of Massachusetts General Hospital

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.000
conducted by Dr. Elliot Hartigan

00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:50.708
found that the risks
for both overdose and dependency

00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:54.208
for patients using Lonafen
were less than 1%.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.291
Lonafen is the world's first
sublingual fentanyl spray.

00:21:58.375 --> 00:21:59.958
It is applied under the tongue

00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.083
where the sublingual artery
absorbs the medication

00:22:02.166 --> 00:22:04.875
into the bloodstream in just five minutes.

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:08.291
That's the fastest relief
a patient can get without a needle.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.208
- What are you doing?
- When patients experience spiking pain...

"...has been the standard

Oh, wow. Sketch-a-rama, jeez.

That, my friends, is the $9 million man.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.916
Guys, here's the deal.
It's safer than aspirin.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.083
And because it works faster,
you can reduce other pain meds.

Yeah, I got epilepsy going on.

- That's a tumor.
- It's not a tumor. It's not cancer.

00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:53.583
Uh, we call it AVM,
arteriovenous malformation.

00:27:53.666 --> 00:27:55.583
It's a little tangle of blood vessels,

00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:58.958
and when the blood backs up,
it swells, and you get a seizure.

00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:02.833
So, what do we do?

00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:04.833
Well, I'm hoping nothing.

00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:07.875
This thing's small and looks stable,

00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:11.833
and sometimes childhood AVMs
get straightened out during puberty.

00:28:11.916 --> 00:28:12.750
Ugh, gross.

00:28:12.833 --> 00:28:14.916
Um, what if it doesn't?

00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:17.958
We'll probably need to get him out.

00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:20.875
Option A,
which is a fine option, a full craniotomy.

00:28:20.958 --> 00:28:22.666
[Liza] I.e., cut open Phoebe's skull

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.250
and scoop out the not-a-tumor
with a melon baller.

00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:26.416
Or option B...

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.875
...is a keyhole procedure,
where we go in through the nose.

00:28:28.958 --> 00:28:32.708
Lower risk, minimally invasive,
we don't have to retract the brain...

00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:35.125
[Liza] The only hitch,
the non-melon baller option

00:28:35.208 --> 00:28:36.625
wasn't covered by Medicaid.

00:28:36.708 --> 00:28:39.416
And they don't cover the keyhole option,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.750
the radiation, or the post-op therapy.

00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:44.083
But for now,

00:28:44.166 --> 00:28:45.875
unless there's another seizure,

00:28:46.416 --> 00:28:50.041
dizziness, headaches,
I don't need to see you for six months.

00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:51.958
Meantime, Phoebe,

00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:55.916
I want you getting plenty of rest,
staying on top of your meds,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.583
and Mom, do what we can
to keep things calm and stable at home.

00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:03.000
[rap music blasting]

00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:10.041
[engine revving]

00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:17.500
It's not forever. It's two months max.

00:29:17.583 --> 00:29:20.041
- I'll get a decent job, an apartment.
- Two months?

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:22.291
It's gonna be awesome.
It's gonna be great.

00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:24.416
- [mimics ape noises]
- What are you doing?

00:29:25.333 --> 00:29:27.875
Sorry, I thought
we were making meaningless noises.

00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:29.916
I'm trying to do what's best for you...

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.750
Best for me?
So you want me to live with evil people.

00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:34.291
Your dad's not evil. Come on.

00:29:34.375 --> 00:29:36.125
- Yeah, well, Diana is.
- She's fine.

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:37.708
No, she's not fine, Mom.

00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:40.833
You know what?
She says evil stuff about you.

00:29:40.916 --> 00:29:42.000
Yeah? What'd she say?

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.250
- She...
- What does she say? Say it.

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:46.583
Say it.

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:49.416
She says that you're...

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.666
you're a loser and a... leech,
and that you don't know how to be a mom.

00:29:57.625 --> 00:29:58.708
What an asshole.

00:29:58.791 --> 00:30:00.541
[line ringing]

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.250
[phone ringing]

00:30:04.291 --> 00:30:06.083
- God. Hey, Pete.
- Hey!

00:30:06.166 --> 00:30:07.583
I'm looking at the iPad GPS.

00:30:07.666 --> 00:30:10.083
Want to tell me why
you're 30 miles outside your territory?

00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:12.000
Something came up and, um...

00:30:12.958 --> 00:30:15.916
I got through the whole call sheet.
Nothing. So...

00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:19.765
Thank you for the opportunity.
Want me to put the iPad in the mail?

00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:22.625
No, no, unacceptable!
I paid for five days...

00:30:22.708 --> 00:30:25.625
It only took four to get turned down
by every whale in the state.

00:30:25.708 --> 00:30:28.125
Well, then you get
turned down again! Okay?

00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:30.208
I own you until five o'clock!

00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:32.583
I'm taking Phoebe
up to her dad's in Savannah.

00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:35.000
Well, luckily,
Savannah is not going anywhere!

00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:36.875
You are holding the bag
until five o'clock,

00:30:36.958 --> 00:30:38.875
or I will incinerate your fucking life!

00:30:38.958 --> 00:30:41.875
I will drag your ass
through small claims court. I will...

00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:43.375
Hello?

00:30:48.125 --> 00:30:49.291
[Phoebe] What are we doing?

00:30:49.375 --> 00:30:53.333
[Liza] We're just gonna cool out
for 12 minutes. All right?

00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:55.416
- Why?
- Because, so I don't get sued.

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:57.750
Just chill, baby, please.

00:30:57.833 --> 00:30:59.125
Okay? Please.

00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:00.208
Okay.

00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:04.750
[Phoebe] Oh, hey, it's Dr. Sketchball.

00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:19.333
Keep the doors locked.

00:31:24.458 --> 00:31:26.375
[Dr. Lydell] No,
this is a circular conversation

00:31:26.458 --> 00:31:28.291
that I'm getting really tired of having.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.291
This is what I keep saying.
The prenup is airtight on spousal support.

00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:35.166
Where is she getting 40%?

00:31:39.208 --> 00:31:41.166
Just... Just... No. Nope.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.916
Lucky lady. My ex took the business.

00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:46.583
Hey.

00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:48.708
- It's apple slump.
- Don't worry.

00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:52.041
I'm not gonna pitch you.
I came for my Tupperware. That all right?

00:31:54.083 --> 00:31:55.500
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:06.166
[Kate] Baby. If you don't tell him
about the side effects, I will.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.125
[Matt] I don't want to get into it.

00:32:08.208 --> 00:32:09.250
It is what it is.

00:32:10.666 --> 00:32:13.333
- Hey, Matt, what's new, man?
- The mouth sores are new.

00:32:13.416 --> 00:32:16.250
- [Dr. Lydell] It's okay.
- Nothing's okay. He can barely talk.

00:32:16.333 --> 00:32:18.458
He walks around like a zombie all the time

00:32:18.541 --> 00:32:20.708
because he's always
sucking on this lollipop

00:32:20.791 --> 00:32:22.791
and it never works. He's always in pain.

00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:24.625
[Dr. Lydell] Sounds like we should think

00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:26.541
about stepping down the Xeraphen dosage.

00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:28.166
That might be a good idea.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.958
[Matt] Can I just get outta here, please?

00:32:30.041 --> 00:32:32.041
- Are you in pain? The mouth sores...
- [Matt] No!

00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:34.000
[Dr. Lydell] Hold tight. One sec.

00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:36.958
- Excuse me.
- Don't get the question.

00:32:37.041 --> 00:32:39.458
I accidentally overheard you.
Why didn't you help him?

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.791
- What's your name again?
- Liza Drake.

00:32:41.875 --> 00:32:44.208
All the complaints,
the mouth sores, the onset time,

00:32:44.291 --> 00:32:46.041
is exactly where Lonafen would be better.

00:32:46.125 --> 00:32:48.333
I'm not trying to sell you.
I'm done with it.

00:32:48.416 --> 00:32:50.500
It just makes no fucking sense to me.

00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:53.000
Why is nobody
willing to prescribe a better drug?

00:32:53.083 --> 00:32:54.583
- Why? I don't understand.
- Listen...

00:32:55.083 --> 00:32:57.166
Liza, the truth is,

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.750
you can't just switch patients
every time there's a new medication.

00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:04.041
- Xeraphen is a known quantity.
- Known to be terrible. She just told you.

00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:07.208
- I don't know that Lonafen is different.
- You won't even give it a shot.

00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:08.291
Excuse me...

00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:10.666
What are you talking about?

00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:15.583
[Dr. Lydell] It's chemically identical
to what you're already taking,

00:33:15.666 --> 00:33:21.958
but... the onset time is purportedly faster
and should help you with your mouth sores.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.375
Yeah, I don't know.

00:33:27.208 --> 00:33:28.208
[Matt] I didn't.

00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:31.583
All I knew was I was scared, all the time.

00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:34.250
And I'm not a frightened person.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.666
I was a Navy corpsman, by the way.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.458
Greenside in Iraq.

00:33:39.541 --> 00:33:42.541
I saw some things,
got through some sporty situations,

00:33:43.458 --> 00:33:44.666
but I was never afraid.

00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:46.708
Never had a bad dream.

00:33:47.958 --> 00:33:49.291
But when I got sick, bro...

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:52.458
I was in mortal fucking terror.

00:33:56.291 --> 00:33:58.583
[Matt] To keep that hurt
from sneaking up on you,

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:02.291
you get to where
you want to stay juiced up all the time.

00:34:04.708 --> 00:34:05.708
[boy] Mom...

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.500
can we please get something to eat?

00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:08.416
Lobby now.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.208
- But, Mom...
- Lobby... now!

00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.041
Yeah, okay.

00:34:29.375 --> 00:34:30.375
Okay?

00:34:32.041 --> 00:34:34.916
We'll have to start you back
at 100 micrograms

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.416
and see if we need
to titrate you up from there.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.916
First couple weeks will be rocky.

00:34:43.125 --> 00:34:45.125
[upbeat music playing]

00:34:57.333 --> 00:34:58.500
[Eric] All right, everyone.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.250
Obviously, we're all looking
at the same numbers,

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:04.833
so you probably already know
what I'm about to say.

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.791
- But the point is...
- No.

00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:10.708
Okay, well, to bring down overhead

00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:13.375
through this next little stretch...

00:35:13.458 --> 00:35:16.000
- Nice power suit. What's up?
- Nothing.

00:35:16.083 --> 00:35:18.250
I just... got a script.

00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:21.833
- Who?
- Dr. Lydell in Lakeland.

00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:24.583
- Wow.
- [Brent] Bullshit.

00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:25.666
I did.

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:28.125
- Check it.
- [Catherine] Checking it.

00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:33.041
- 100 mics. Big fucking deal.
- That is a big fucking deal.

00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:36.166
That's my nine million-dollar man,
and Liza got him pregnant.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.833
- Think he's pregnant?
- I think he's pretty pregnant.

00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:41.875
He told you explicitly
he's gonna write more Lonafen?

00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:45.333
He said he wanted to join
our speaker program, so I said, "Great."

00:35:45.416 --> 00:35:47.000
You said we had a speaker program?

00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:49.541
No, I said Dr. Lydell's
gonna launch our speaker program,

00:35:49.625 --> 00:35:50.750
and it's gonna be amazing.

00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:54.166
Speaker programs
are pharma's dirty little secret,

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.000
minus the little and secret.

00:35:56.083 --> 00:35:59.500
What's a speaker program?
It's where you fly prescribers

00:35:59.583 --> 00:36:03.041
to Hawaii, Pebble Beach,
and if you're doing it by the book,

00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:06.041
you get some asshole
to speed read a slide deck

00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:09.583
so everyone can get back
to hitting on drug reps and getting drunk.

00:36:09.666 --> 00:36:12.166
And then they fly home
and they write your drug.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.583
It's a legal grift,

00:36:14.083 --> 00:36:15.458
and everybody was doing it.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.166
And we would have too.

00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:19.958
But we were broke.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.833
Hotels, flights, catering.

00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:25.333
- Who's gonna book it? Kathy gonna book it?
- It's Catherine.

00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:28.333
I don't think it needs to be
a fancy boondoggle.

00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:31.250
He drives a PT Cruiser,
going through divorce, and lonely.

00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:34.000
He'd be psyched
to hold court at a taco stand.

00:36:35.125 --> 00:36:36.166
No fucking way.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.250
[sighs]

00:36:46.583 --> 00:36:48.208
[cash register ding]

00:36:48.291 --> 00:36:52.250
[Brent] The issue with this right here
is that these floors are warped.

00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:56.583
So it's probably gonna take a curve
up in here, and then...

00:36:56.666 --> 00:36:57.958
[Liza] I have an idea.

00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:00.958
What if fuck Brent Larkin?

00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:02.166
Love that? How?

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.083
We do the event on the cheap,
pay for it out of pocket.

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:06.000
Nah...

00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:08.541
- Why not?
- I don't want my dick on a chopping block.

00:37:08.625 --> 00:37:09.625
I mean cheap-cheap.

00:37:09.708 --> 00:37:11.583
We kick in, like, 400 bucks apiece.

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:14.625
A ten-point commission
on $9 million a year.

00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:16.208
Dumbass doesn't get any of it.

00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:17.500
- Come on.
- I don't know.

00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:18.583
What don't you know?

00:37:22.875 --> 00:37:25.208
As a wise man once said,
it's a lottery ticket.

00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:27.208
He's got to have the grit
to scratch his balls.

00:37:27.708 --> 00:37:30.625
[Brent] Look at that panel.
You're gonna hear that nice ding.

00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:32.541
- You're gonna hear it ding.
- I like you.

00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.875
- [golf ball dings]
- [Brent] Oh!

00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:37.125
[laughs] Whoo!

00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:38.041
Good.

00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:40.125
[dramatic music playing]

00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:57.041
Hey!

00:37:57.791 --> 00:37:59.000
Saved you a seat.

00:37:59.083 --> 00:38:00.500
Where are the doctors?

00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:03.083
Half of them couldn't make it,
and the rest are no-shows.

00:38:03.166 --> 00:38:04.166

and tell him not to come,

I'll give you the pleasure.

00:39:27.375 --> 00:39:30.291
- Who? What? Who's Matt?
- Your patient. Is Lonafen working for him?

00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:31.500
- What?
- How is he?

00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:32.750

00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:39.541
He said, "Doc, I oughta fuck you up
for not switching me six months ago."

00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:43.916
[Matt] No bullshit.

Huge, huge.

- Those guys?

00:40:06.458 --> 00:40:09.166
Not those guys.
They're podiatrists. The industry.

00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:13.750
The industry... needs to hear that

- What else do you want from me?
- Come on.

I want to know how to get doctors
to write the best drug. How?

00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:25.375

- We told Jack. He's cool with it.

00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:34.458
Okay.

00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:37.916
Yeah, we're greenlit
to pilot the program in the southeast.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
We're staffing up.

00:47:39.958 --> 00:47:40.958
Check it out.

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.291
[upbeat music playing]

00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:54.333
Want to tell us a bit about yourself?

00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:57.083
Yes! Pre-med at UF, Phi Beta Kappa.

00:47:59.625 --> 00:48:02.666
Interned at Merck.
I was a Pfizer junior leader there.

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:03.916
- Yes.
- No.

00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:07.375
Says you got your pharmacy degree
from Amherst.

00:48:07.458 --> 00:48:10.708
- I didn't know they had a pharmacy school.
- Yep. One of the best.

00:48:10.791 --> 00:48:12.541
Remind me. What's their mascot?

00:48:16.416 --> 00:48:17.666
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:21.583
What's your story, for real?

00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:22.916
[Maria] All right. For real.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.958
[chuckles nervously] Um...

00:48:25.958 --> 00:48:29.916
Out of school I sold tires...
for minimum wage plus commission,

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.083
which my manager kept.

00:48:32.166 --> 00:48:35.625
Um, I did that for ten years, quit,

00:48:35.708 --> 00:48:38.291
and now I do the same sort of shit
selling shower doors.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.583
Um, CPAP machines, hot tubs...

00:48:45.666 --> 00:48:48.625
Parakeets, essential oils,
these pump-up penis things.

00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:51.333
Body shots. Lap dances.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.083
My own dignity.

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.166
Why do you want to sell pharmaceuticals?

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:01.166
When the child support is late,
my kid doesn't eat.

00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:05.500
So I can stop lying to my kids
about what I do for a living.

00:49:06.916 --> 00:49:09.333
What makes you think
you can close a doctor with our drug?

00:49:09.416 --> 00:49:11.458
It's a best-in-class medication

00:49:11.541 --> 00:49:14.458
with one-tenth the onset time
of the competition.

00:49:14.541 --> 00:49:17.708
Because, for a 10% commission,
I'd eat flaming razor blades.

00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:21.583
Because I'm banging an oncologist
in Plant City.

00:49:23.916 --> 00:49:26.708
I did field marketing for Malibu Rum,

00:49:26.791 --> 00:49:30.125
and I was Miss Hawaiian Tropic, Pensacola.

00:49:30.208 --> 00:49:31.958
- Hell no.
- Sweet Jesus, yes.

00:49:32.041 --> 00:49:33.041
Come on.

00:49:33.416 --> 00:49:35.333
Because my dad's a pain doc,

00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:38.750
and he said he'll write your drug
if you hire me.

00:49:40.125 --> 00:49:41.875
[Liza] 67 in a 65?

00:49:44.833 --> 00:49:45.916
Welcome to the team.

00:49:54.666 --> 00:49:56.750
Hell to the motherfucking no.

00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:59.208
You can hire the sex toy
if I can hire my mom.

00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:01.166
You'll regret it.

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:02.458
So will you.

00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:04.250
Dr. Jack's rule.

00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:06.041
PhDs only.

00:50:06.125 --> 00:50:07.583
Well, none of them are PhDs.

00:50:07.666 --> 00:50:08.958
"Poor, hungry, and dumb."

00:50:09.041 --> 00:50:11.166
In your case,
the "D" stood for "desperate."

00:50:13.833 --> 00:50:15.416
[Liza] What you do today...

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.208
informs who you're gonna be tomorrow.

00:50:18.291 --> 00:50:21.458
You got to work it
like your fucking back's against the wall.

00:50:22.375 --> 00:50:26.291
You don't just work the territory,
you own your territory.

00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:29.541
Okay? You own your territory.

00:50:29.625 --> 00:50:32.750
You own a territory, you own a doctor.

00:50:33.375 --> 00:50:36.541
- You own your territory, you own a doctor.
- [all] Own a doctor.

00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:39.875
- You own your territory, you own a doctor!
- Own a doctor!

00:50:39.958 --> 00:50:42.916
- Own a territory!
- You own a doctor!

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.208
[Liza] We lived or died
by the clinic gatekeepers,

00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:47.041
and there's nothing
a 50-year-old desk nurse

00:50:47.125 --> 00:50:51.000
hates more than a young hot thing
half her age pulling twice her salary.

00:50:51.083 --> 00:50:53.791
Look, lady, I need to know
when I get to see the doctor.

00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:56.291
Hey, Sonya. How are you?

00:50:56.375 --> 00:50:58.041
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

00:51:01.666 --> 00:51:04.333
{\an8}[Liza] Greasing doctors is an art,
not a science.

00:51:04.416 --> 00:51:06.916
Every drug company's
trying to put money in their hands.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.500
You can't just throw checks at 'em.
They all think you're wearing a wire.

00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:13.375
- I'm just not quite sure...
- [Nicole] That you can trust me?

00:51:13.458 --> 00:51:14.666
[scoffs]

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:20.083
Doctor, I have two mortgages,
three kids, one with special needs.

00:51:20.958 --> 00:51:25.458
If you join our speakers bureau,
you would be my partner and my lifeline.

00:51:26.666 --> 00:51:29.500
I will walk through fire to protect you.

00:51:31.875 --> 00:51:32.958
[cash register ding]

00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:38.041
[woman] Thank you for sharing, Doctor.

00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:39.750
[Liza] And never forget.

00:51:39.833 --> 00:51:42.125
Always hire a rep with versatility.

00:51:45.166 --> 00:51:46.625

00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:02.041
[Jackie] Hey, come with me?
Just this first time.

00:52:02.125 --> 00:52:04.625
Nope, it's time
to spread your wings, little bird.

00:52:04.708 --> 00:52:05.708
You got this.

00:52:09.541 --> 00:52:11.291
[Liza] And while our blue-chip competitors

00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:14.250
were fighting over
the marquee MDs at the Mayo Clinic...

00:52:14.333 --> 00:52:15.333
Dr. Davis?

00:52:16.208 --> 00:52:17.541
Jackie Drake from Zanna.

00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:20.458
...we were going after the guys
Pfizer wouldn't toss a free pen.

00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:21.666
How you doing?

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:25.541
Well, I'm... doing especially well
right now, thank you.

00:52:26.041 --> 00:52:28.500
And without that platoon
of desperate reps,

00:52:28.583 --> 00:52:31.708
we'd have never hit our gold mine
of desperate doctors.

00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:35.375
- Thank you all for coming.
- [cork pops]

00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:40.541
[Liza] The real education at our events
was us learning the doctors

00:52:40.625 --> 00:52:43.125
were just as greedy
and horny as everyone else.

00:52:43.208 --> 00:52:46.208

00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:05.875
What made us different?

00:53:06.875 --> 00:53:10.958
I'd tell my reps, like,
don't treat your doctor like a sale.

00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:12.708
Be family to them. Be a friend.

Walk their dogs.

Sit through a folk-rock serenade
if that's their thing.

They needed us.

- It takes some getting used to.

00:53:34.166 --> 00:53:35.416
- But I like it.
- Yeah?

I like the way it makes me feel.
I walk a little faster, little taller.

I mean, maybe we pushed it to 70,

but that's what it would take
to storm the castle,

00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:23.875
to get the best-in-class medication
to people who needed it.

00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:27.833
It wasn't pretty, but hey, we won.

00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:32.125
In one quarter, we'd gone from zero
to 86% market share in the southeast.

our medicine was reaching the people
who really needed it.

00:55:04.125 --> 00:55:07.333
What's remarkable? On Saturday, I said,
"Kids, we're gonna do something."

"Mommy is out of pain."
We went hiking, if you can believe that.

You're a joke.

Almost as funny as your programs
that are banned 'cause you're crooks.

00:55:46.791 --> 00:55:49.083
That just means we can devote
our entire marketing budget

00:55:49.166 --> 00:55:50.958

00:56:08.125 --> 00:56:11.208
didn't just win back their prescribers
with better programs, more money,

00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:12.125

not just to opioid tolerant
cancer patients,

00:56:29.166 --> 00:56:30.500

Headaches, hangnails.
"Here, have some fentanyl."

So how's the law
protecting you from these scumbags?

00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:37.833
They're not.

00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:39.583
Praxiom didn't get shut down.

00:56:39.666 --> 00:56:41.541
Nobody did a day of jail time.

00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:43.583
The judge hit 'em with a standard fine,

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.791
and they banned them
from greasing doctors...

my closet is bigger than my old room.

00:57:23.458 --> 00:57:25.833
We have a fizzy tub, by the way,
and my new best friend

00:57:25.916 --> 00:57:27.625

00:57:48.708 --> 00:57:51.541

Oh, I can pay full tuition.

00:58:15.208 --> 00:58:16.708

00:58:16.791 --> 00:58:19.541
Can't tell you what it meant
to finally be one of those people

00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:21.916
you can't shame, shake down, or fuck over.

00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:26.041
- Could you pay enhanced tuition?
- What's enhanced tuition?

00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:27.208
Double.

00:58:27.291 --> 00:58:28.666
Why would I pay double?

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:31.875
Well, the school
took on some debt to buy the animals,

00:58:31.958 --> 00:58:33.125
so to keep the program,

00:58:33.208 --> 00:58:35.625
we're having to reach out
to our community.

00:58:35.708 --> 00:58:37.791
[Liza] And then
you climb a couple tax brackets,

00:58:37.875 --> 00:58:39.875
and it's the same old grift,
only for more money,

00:58:40.375 --> 00:58:43.291
and it smells like gardenias
and alpaca shit.

00:58:45.375 --> 00:58:46.458
Double it is.

00:58:47.083 --> 00:58:48.125
Mmm.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.250
[Liza] Hi.

00:58:58.041 --> 00:58:59.041
[Jackie] Hey.

00:58:59.583 --> 00:59:01.333
- [Liza] Oh my God.
- What?

00:59:01.416 --> 00:59:04.583
Where there's a popcorn tower, there's you
asking me to do something fucked up.

00:59:04.666 --> 00:59:07.583
- Oh. Ever heard of just being nice?
- Sure.

00:59:07.666 --> 00:59:10.166
I'm a little honked off
about the speaker programs.

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:12.583
I know, they're fucking gross
and over the line,

00:59:12.666 --> 00:59:15.750
and after the IPO, we'll bring them
into compliance. All good.

00:59:15.833 --> 00:59:18.250
No. I love the events,
when they let me do one.

00:59:18.333 --> 00:59:20.875
- Mom.
- But Pete's been giving my speaker money

00:59:20.958 --> 00:59:23.083
to that girl who makes sales calls
in her underwear.

00:59:23.166 --> 00:59:25.500
You bonused 30 grand.
You're doing all right.

00:59:25.583 --> 00:59:27.041
Tina boasts 125.

00:59:27.125 --> 00:59:30.333
I have a really early meeting
with Dr. Jack, and I need to focus.

00:59:30.416 --> 00:59:33.458
- It's important I get my head around it.
- Okay, even better.

00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:37.833
Tell him that I think we should
deduct honorariums from net sales.

00:59:37.916 --> 00:59:40.791
Then I'd probably be, like,
number one on my team.

00:59:40.875 --> 00:59:42.041
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:43.291
I will think about it.

00:59:43.833 --> 00:59:44.833
Thank you.

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.166
[Jackie] Hi!

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.166

- [Jackie] You need help?

00:59:50.291 --> 00:59:51.291
[Phoebe] I guess so.

00:59:52.166 --> 00:59:53.166
Do you read French?

00:59:53.708 --> 00:59:55.625

00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:56.958
No. Dead.

00:59:57.041 --> 00:59:57.958
Okay, your dad.

00:59:58.041 --> 00:59:58.916
Him too.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.666
God, Pete, I'm so sorry.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:03.458
Don't be.
They would have been shitty grandparents.

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:05.333
They what?

01:00:06.083 --> 01:00:08.208
Really? Would have thought she leaked it.

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:10.583
Tina's knocked up.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:14.291
So the moral of quarter three,
$96 million in the Southeast.

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:15.791
The speaker programs work.

01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:18.916
And if the 86% market share metric scales,
which it will,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.208
implementing
the speaker programs nationwide,

01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:23.500
we'll be within spitting distance
of a billion a year.

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:26.750
[chuckles]

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:30.291
Minus half a billion in fines
for any kickback violations.

01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:34.583
Uh, no, because, as Pete mentioned,

01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:37.666
post IPO we'll be running the programs
through a compliance team. Thanks.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.291
Because compliance, ethics,
that's your thing, Liza?

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:43.375
- Should be all of our thing, Brent.
- [Brent] Yeah, it should.

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:47.833
By the way, I got this weird package
from a Randy Drake, your ex-husband.

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:50.875
He wanted to correct a few things
on the bio from your site.

01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:56.208
You actually didn't go to college,
or finish high school,

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:59.500
and before joining our team,
you got naked for money.

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:01.791
- Fucking give me that.
- Hold on now! Hold on.

01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:05.583
I'm guessing that's how you two met.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:08.458
And as far as your
illuminated career in pharma...

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:10.791
that you made up.

01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:14.041
Unless you count your time
as a drug trafficker,

01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:16.791
which got you a felony conviction in 2010.

01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:18.708
I sold THC gummies.

01:01:18.791 --> 01:01:21.250
Some to people in chronic pain,
which I think actually...

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:23.458
[Brent] And you served three months,

01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:26.375
meaning you lied about the jail question
on the application too.

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:36.166
Was that a... envelope slap on my desk?

01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:40.416
I just thought you should know the truth.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.958
Truth is you're being disrespectful
to that young lady.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.250

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:54.166

what your opinion was.

I'm not gonna let you quit.

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:36.958

It's when you've been

so, six more months, you can sell.

01:09:16.708 --> 01:09:19.583

to find out your mother is a human being?

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:31.958
You know what's horrible?

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.875

Dr. Frazier wrote last week?

01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:19.166
- No.
- [Jack] Four.

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:23.000
You know how many he wrote this week?
Four. You see the problem?

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:29.916
Our sales are flat. F-L-A-T. Flat.
You're fucking killing this company.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Sales are flat at $170 million a quarter
'cause we won cancer.

If you don't grow, you die.
Where's the growth?

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.416
The doctors don't know it
because our messaging is fucked!

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.333
Our messaging?

01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:47.500
There are millions of people
out there in agony,

01:13:47.583 --> 01:13:52.166
suffering from kidney stones,
and fibromyalgia and post-operative pain.

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:55.500
And we're telling our doctors,
you can't treat 'em unless it's cancer?

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:56.750
Why cancer?

01:13:56.833 --> 01:14:00.000
The FDA only approved Lonafen
for opioid tolerant cancer patients.

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:02.125
I hear you.
I think Dr. Neel's point... Liza.

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:04.083
- What?
- What Dr. Neel is saying,

01:14:04.166 --> 01:14:06.458
and it's an excellent point,
is that pain is pain.

01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:08.500
Thank you very much. That's exactly it.

01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:10.041

- My mom.
- Your mother.

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:12.458
- She has sent me three of these.
- Oh God. I'm so sorry.

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:15.916
You violated our HR process
by hiring your mother.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:16.833
- And that...
- How?

01:15:16.916 --> 01:15:19.666
How? [scoffs]
'Cause you hired your mother.

01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:24.208
And you didn't clear it with me.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.458
You have to get rid of her.

01:15:32.541 --> 01:15:36.083
And you have to take responsibility
that she never contacts me again.

01:15:36.166 --> 01:15:39.041
And... you're gonna get
her signature on this.

01:15:44.916 --> 01:15:46.625
When do your options vest, Liza?

01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:48.250

01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:49.458
[Jack] In November.

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:53.375

No. What?

01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:38.458
This...

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:41.125
That doesn't make sense. What did I do?

01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:45.875
Dr. Neel didn't love your,
um, popcorn towers.

01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:47.916
Oh, fuck him. I was trying to be nice.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.791
Really? Out of the goodness
of your heart you thought,

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:53.958
"That demented billionaire
would love Cracker Jack. I'm gonna do it."

01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:56.416
- What's wrong with that? No.
- Everything.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.708
Liza, you weren't helping me
with my bribe money, and I thought...

01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:02.125
- Jack would put in a word.
- Oh God.

01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:04.500
Did you ask Dr. Neel
for more speaker money?

01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:05.916
What is wrong with you?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.875
It's the least he could do.
What's it to him?

01:17:07.958 --> 01:17:09.750
No. What's it to me? What's it to me?

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:13.000
I put my neck out to get you this job,
and you embarrass me.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.458
You embarrass yourself.

01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:17.416
Really? I fucked the boss
in front of the whole company?

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.458
- Don't be nasty.
- I'm not being nasty.

01:17:19.541 --> 01:17:21.666
I am the one person, Liza,

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:24.000
the one person in your life
who stuck by you.

When everyone else was all
"Crazy Liza blew it again,"

01:17:29.041 --> 01:17:30.416
- I held my tongue.
- Did you?

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.416
- I said...
- You thought I was a loser too?

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.125
- No.
- And you just lied about it?

01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:37.416
Is that your big fucking triumph as a mom?
Good for you.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.583
No, I'm saying I... I stood by you!

You gave us to Meemaw and PopPop

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:48.875

You know what? Okay.

01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:03.833
Name one thing you ever taught me beside,
"Get your ass hitched young

01:18:03.916 --> 01:18:06.125
and squeeze out a kid
so he won't leave you."

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:08.291
Name one thing you ever did for me. One.

01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:09.791
I made you a survivor.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:12.208

So I thought, what the hell?

01:30:03.083 --> 01:30:04.208
You all right?

01:30:10.541 --> 01:30:13.041
- I need to talk to you about something.
- What's up?

01:30:13.125 --> 01:30:15.208
- My daughter, remember Phoebe?
- Of course.

01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.458
She's not doing good.

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:19.833
- And, um, she needs surgery.
- Oh.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.666
And insurance won't cover it.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:28.666
And I put aside as much as I could,
but I need another 450 to pay for it.

01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:30.083
I'm not asking for a gift.

01:30:31.958 --> 01:30:34.708
I was just thinking
I could sell you my stock options.

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:36.625
Before you vest?

01:30:38.375 --> 01:30:41.500
What, you're not thinking of leaving us,
are you, Liza?

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:43.333
- No.
- [Jack] Mmm.

01:30:43.416 --> 01:30:46.583
Her surgery's next month though,
and I don't vest till November.

01:30:46.666 --> 01:30:48.916
- So, it's a problem.
- [Jack] Yeah. I see the problem.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.375
But here's the thing.

01:30:51.583 --> 01:30:55.333
When my wife was dying,
I was so benumbed with shock and grief

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:59.833
that I didn't realize that her illness
brought with it a secret gift,

01:30:59.916 --> 01:31:03.208
a new sense of time, a creative fire.

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:07.333
Use your crisis as your fire.

01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:10.250
You'd be amazed at what you're capable of.

01:31:12.458 --> 01:31:14.958
Well, you can start
by running down those patients.

01:31:17.083 --> 01:31:18.083
Crisis.

01:31:18.625 --> 01:31:19.625
Fire.

01:31:22.416 --> 01:31:23.416
Come on now.

01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:25.750
Phoebe needs you.

01:32:27.458 --> 01:32:28.458
[Liza] Hi.

01:32:31.958 --> 01:32:32.958
Hi, baby.

01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:36.750
Mom.

01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:38.041
It's okay. It's okay.

01:32:38.125 --> 01:32:39.541
[girl crying]

01:32:39.625 --> 01:32:41.458
It's all right, baby. It's okay.

01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:43.541
Just go to your sister, okay?

01:32:46.625 --> 01:32:48.750
Just wanted to bring you back your...

01:32:53.541 --> 01:32:54.625
Oh God. [crying]

01:32:57.250 --> 01:32:58.791
I'm so sorry, Camille.

01:33:25.375 --> 01:33:27.375
[melancholy music playing]

01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:37.458
You didn't do anything.

01:33:40.083 --> 01:33:41.291
It's not your fault.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.750
You're not a bad person.

01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:50.583
[Liza] I will not give up on myself.

01:33:51.791 --> 01:33:53.875
I will not give up on my dreams.

01:33:54.666 --> 01:33:56.541
I will make my life count.

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:00.166
I will make my life count.

01:34:04.958 --> 01:34:07.583
- You should have a lawyer present.
- [Liza] That's fine.

01:34:08.583 --> 01:34:10.000
I want you to know...

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.083
that I helped build... our speaker program.

01:34:18.333 --> 01:34:19.750
Our bribery program.

01:34:21.875 --> 01:34:23.583
Tried to bring it into compliance.

01:34:24.958 --> 01:34:26.875
Who else signed off on these programs?

01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:28.791
Eric Paley.

01:34:33.416 --> 01:34:34.541
Pete Brenner.

01:34:42.666 --> 01:34:43.708
Jack Neel.

01:34:43.791 --> 01:34:47.125
Oh, it all came down from Jack.
I'll testify to that.

01:34:47.208 --> 01:34:49.666
[sighs] We need more than your testimony...

01:34:50.708 --> 01:34:52.375
because this is how this will go.

01:34:52.916 --> 01:34:55.041
Neel will hire these incredible lawyers

01:34:55.125 --> 01:34:58.375
who'll tell this sad story to the jury
about a sweet old man

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.500
who got taken in by a master crook
named Liza Drake.

01:35:01.583 --> 01:35:05.708
No, I came in as a low-level rep.
He's a fucking billionaire with a PhD.

01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:10.291
Fair point. But if you don't want to eat
your boss's share on this,

01:35:10.375 --> 01:35:12.708
we need proof
tying Neel to the bribery scheme.

01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:13.791
What kind of proof?

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:15.833
Documents. Voice recordings.

01:35:15.916 --> 01:35:18.791
You don't get it.
He never touches the day-to-day and he's...

01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:21.333
he hasn't been in the office
since the IPO.

01:35:21.416 --> 01:35:23.250
You can't get near him with a phone.

01:35:23.333 --> 01:35:26.250
He has this guy,
he has a guy with a wand thing...

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:27.458
Texts, emails.

01:35:27.541 --> 01:35:31.458
Bring us something proving
Neel's involvement, we can deal.

01:35:31.541 --> 01:35:34.041
He has a flip phone, he doesn't email.

01:35:34.125 --> 01:35:36.250
The way it works is you... I...

01:35:36.333 --> 01:35:38.833
We would email... the CEO...

01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:40.166
- [Jane] Brenner.
- Yeah.

01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:43.791
And then Brenner prints a hard copy,
and then Jack marks it up and...

01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:48.750
Brenner gives us the gist of it
and eats the original. I don't know.

01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:52.125
Can you bring us some of those printouts?

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:56.750
And we'll tell the judge no jail time.

01:36:01.041 --> 01:36:02.791
[Liza] Dr. Jack was right about one thing.

01:36:03.833 --> 01:36:07.666
There's nothing so inspiring
as sheer desperation.

01:36:08.666 --> 01:36:11.875
I wrote an e-mail to Pete
saying I tracked down Lydell's patients

01:36:11.958 --> 01:36:13.166
to 18 different doctors

01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:16.833
and that I needed a quarter mil right away
to get 'em into the program.

01:36:16.916 --> 01:36:20.416
I said they wanted golf memberships,
college tuition bills,

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:22.833
all sorts of things
for Jack to have opinions about.

01:36:27.291 --> 01:36:31.041
And Dr. Jack, bless his heart,
he put his stink all over the document.

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:35.791
And Brenner, per my instructions,

01:36:35.875 --> 01:36:39.250
he brought it to our sales meeting,
which was going down that night.

01:36:42.375 --> 01:36:44.250
Okay, so this Patton guy.

01:36:44.333 --> 01:36:45.750
Low decile.

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:49.041
Jack says no way to this college bill
until he proves himself.

01:36:50.958 --> 01:36:51.958
Nice tights.

01:36:56.833 --> 01:36:57.833
Everything okay?

01:36:58.208 --> 01:36:59.208
Yeah.

01:36:59.958 --> 01:37:00.958
[Pete clears throat]

And it's low scripts.

01:38:02.583 --> 01:38:03.583

That's what I'm talking about.
Y'all feel me?

01:38:50.416 --> 01:38:51.416
[Pete] Liza!

01:38:58.750 --> 01:39:00.833
Where are you going? It's breakout groups.

01:39:02.958 --> 01:39:06.125
Yeah, Phoebe's sick,
so, Nicole's gonna take mine, okay?

01:39:06.625 --> 01:39:08.125
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:11.166
- Sorry, anything I can do?
- All good. She'll be fine.

01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:12.250
See you tomorrow.

01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:15.875
- Thoughts and prayers.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:39:15.958 --> 01:39:17.458
Jesus, fuck.

- Give me this shit!
- What the fuck!

01:39:28.833 --> 01:39:30.416
You appalling piece of shit.

01:39:32.416 --> 01:39:33.541
When'd they get to ya?

01:39:35.958 --> 01:39:36.958
I went to them.

01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:43.416
Why would you do that?

01:39:44.833 --> 01:39:47.833
Why would you do that, Liza? God damn it!

01:39:47.916 --> 01:39:50.416
Remember where you were
when I scooped you outta there?

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:51.875
- I know.
- When I gave you a shot?

01:39:51.958 --> 01:39:55.250
I gave you a fucking life,
and you do this to me?

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.166
Pete, we killed people.

01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:58.666
Oh, bullshit!

01:40:00.625 --> 01:40:05.291
We did this, and now you're out there
and you're, like, bonusing higher doses.

01:40:05.375 --> 01:40:08.291
- We don't write the scripts!
- People are dead because of us!

01:40:10.875 --> 01:40:14.083
Do you not get that? Do you just not care?
What's wrong with you?

01:40:14.166 --> 01:40:16.875
You care? Funny how it took
your whale getting busted

01:40:16.958 --> 01:40:18.333
for you to sprout a conscience!

01:40:18.416 --> 01:40:20.333
- Fuck you, dude.
- What'd they give you?

01:40:20.416 --> 01:40:24.125
Must've been good to get a greedy fuck
like you to rat before you cashed out.

01:40:24.208 --> 01:40:26.250
- Oh, you don't know me.
- I am you, Liza!

01:40:27.125 --> 01:40:30.000
We're just selfish pieces of shit.
Only with you, there's no limit.

01:40:30.083 --> 01:40:32.041
No, I'm nothing like you.

01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:36.583
I hope you fucking die.

01:40:50.791 --> 01:40:52.541
[Jack] Pete, we're gonna contain this.

01:40:54.125 --> 01:40:56.250
You just need to stick to a certain truth.

01:40:56.333 --> 01:40:57.583
What does that mean?

01:40:57.666 --> 01:40:58.916
[man] You're implicated, Pete.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.666
There's no way around that.

01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:03.583
Dr. Neel's gonna handle
your legal expenses. Look...

01:41:04.416 --> 01:41:07.625
We're gonna get you
the most advantageous plea deal...

01:41:07.708 --> 01:41:10.583
And meet my kid
for the first time behind plexiglass?

01:41:10.666 --> 01:41:13.000
No. No fucking way.
I'm not doing that. No.

01:41:13.083 --> 01:41:14.750
[man] Prison's not on the table,

01:41:14.833 --> 01:41:17.541
but your assets, your house, your savings,

01:41:17.625 --> 01:41:19.583
that's probably all going away.

01:41:19.666 --> 01:41:23.291
Pete. Pete, I love you like a son.
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:26.291
I'll ensure that you and your family
will be comfortable

01:41:26.375 --> 01:41:27.750
for the rest of your lives.

01:41:27.833 --> 01:41:29.500

01:41:37.583 --> 01:41:38.583
[sighs]

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:41.500
If I testify that you knew nothing.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.708
[Jack] It's the best thing for everyone.

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:50.500
- [banging on door]
- [officer] Police! Open the door, sir!

01:41:50.583 --> 01:41:52.291
Pete? Pete...

01:41:53.416 --> 01:41:55.000
[baby fussing]

01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:57.833
[banging continues]

01:42:01.875 --> 01:42:04.958
[Liza] They even caught up
with Eric Paley down in Argentina.

01:42:05.708 --> 01:42:07.333
- [man] You ready to talk?
- Yeah.

01:42:08.833 --> 01:42:11.416
Dr. Neel had no knowledge
of the conspiracy.

01:42:12.833 --> 01:42:14.583
[Liza] But not before Neel's lawyer did.

01:42:21.666 --> 01:42:23.916
[nurse] Miss Drake?
Your daughter's in recovery.

01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:25.875
Is she doing okay?

01:42:25.958 --> 01:42:27.541
She is. She did really well.

01:42:30.333 --> 01:42:31.333
Baby.

01:42:33.708 --> 01:42:34.708
Can you hear me?

01:42:37.166 --> 01:42:38.208
Can you hear me?

01:42:48.666 --> 01:42:49.666
[sighs]

01:43:02.416 --> 01:43:04.375
[Liza] And while everyone else
was going down,

01:43:04.458 --> 01:43:08.041
Neel stuck to his bullshit,
and no one could prove he was lying.

01:43:10.166 --> 01:43:12.041
{\an8}He was on the cover of Forbes.

01:43:14.625 --> 01:43:18.666
When they asked him about the charges
on everyone who'd touched the company...

01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:19.750
My involvement?

01:43:20.916 --> 01:43:22.125
I was an investor.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.541
I had no knowledge
of the daily operations.

01:43:25.625 --> 01:43:26.958
I was a passive investor.

01:43:30.708 --> 01:43:31.791
[Jackie] Please forgive me.

01:43:31.875 --> 01:43:33.041

- The Hartigan study out of Mass General.

I authored the Lonafen study.

01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:06.916
The study was accurate.

Out of a test group of 200 patients
under clinical observation for two years,

01:46:11.333 --> 01:46:13.958
there was only one

What they left out

01:46:16.875 --> 01:46:20.500
was that the drug was administered
to opioid tolerant patients

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:22.458
by responsible doctors
