49:11.333 --> 49:13.500
That I'd throw it somewhere...

49:14.541 --> 49:15.917
or try to hide it,

49:15.999 --> 49:18.750
and-- and someone would find it.

49:18.833 --> 49:21.625
I thought that
if I just put it back...

49:22.750 --> 49:24.541
no one would ever know
it was gone.

49:28.583 --> 49:31.875
After that, I got scared.

49:32.833 --> 49:34.041
I called my dad.

49:40.833 --> 49:43.708
He came home later that night.

49:43.792 --> 49:47.583
Told me that he and Uncle Billy
had sorted everything out.

49:50.458 --> 49:51.917
That it was a secret now.

49:54.833 --> 49:57.333
A secret we could
never tell anyone.

49:59.833 --> 50:00.875
Ever.

50:03.249 --> 50:05.291
It had nothing to do
with Sandra Elliot.

50:11.083 --> 50:12.541
I'd seen him struggling.

50:13.833 --> 50:16.708
Got into a fight at school.
He was sobbing.

50:19.500 --> 50:20.999
The only other time
I'd seen him that upset

50:21.083 --> 50:22.708
was when he found out
his father was having

50:22.792 --> 50:24.208
an affair with Sandra.

50:27.500 --> 50:29.500
I just thought
it must be happening again.

KATE WINSLET: When I
first read the script

1:07:37.708 --> 1:07:39.291
written by Brad Ingelsby,

1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:41.124
it completely
took my breath away.

1:07:41.458 --> 1:07:43.833
Every episode ends
on a real cliffhanger.

1:07:44.124 --> 1:07:46.166
I sat up till
the early hours of the morning,

1:07:46.249 --> 1:07:47.416
reading every single episode.

1:07:47.625 --> 1:07:51.416
I had never read a character
who was able to pull off so much

1:07:51.500 --> 1:07:54.833
in terms of how she copes,
how she deals with people.

1:07:55.124 --> 1:07:57.541
And she's extraordinary
at her job,

1:07:57.625 --> 1:08:01.500
so I felt enormous admiration
for a person like that.

1:08:01.833 --> 1:08:03.792
BRAD INGELSBY: Kate wanted
to pursue the character

1:08:03.875 --> 1:08:07.208
in a way that was lovely
as a writer to have someone

1:08:07.291 --> 1:08:10.041
who wants to put in the time
like that and dig deep.

1:08:10.249 --> 1:08:12.416
Eventually, it became
Kate's creation.

1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:14.375
I trusted her
to make dialogue changes,

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:17.833
because I felt convinced
that she knew this character
better than I did.

1:08:17.999 --> 1:08:20.041
Kate was constantly
adding things, I mean,

1:08:20.458 --> 1:08:23.124
we would rehearse
the scene, block the scene.

1:08:23.208 --> 1:08:24.583
And then... she would say,

1:08:24.667 --> 1:08:26.124
"Mare would
probably just do this."

1:08:26.667 --> 1:08:29.833
Or like... "Should I
be eating something?
Like some junk food?"

1:08:30.541 --> 1:08:34.500
Like how do we make
a new iteration of it
that's even more Mare?

1:08:35.166 --> 1:08:37.583
It's definitely been,
I'd say, one of,

1:08:37.667 --> 1:08:40.458
if not the most challenging
role I've ever played.

1:08:40.541 --> 1:08:42.999
Just because
of how enormous it was,

1:08:43.083 --> 1:08:46.208
the sheer volume of story,
the number of characters.

1:08:46.541 --> 1:08:48.041
And then the dialect.

1:08:48.124 --> 1:08:50.917
All right. Everybody,
put your gloves on.

1:08:50.999 --> 1:08:54.667

that seems out of place.

KATE: Anyone from
Delaware County will know

1:09:00.291 --> 1:09:03.541
that the dialect
is very complicated.

1:09:03.750 --> 1:09:06.416
It's a very subtle one,
which makes it harder
to pick up.

1:09:06.625 --> 1:09:09.458
And it can also sound Southern
if you don't do it right.

1:09:09.541 --> 1:09:12.541

words that I would have,
like "water."

and go home.

in a while, I'd say,

me seven O's in this one line!"

working on a dialect,

1:09:38.208 --> 1:09:39.583
you can start
with the sound changes.

1:09:39.917 --> 1:09:42.583
You can start with
the rhythms, you can start
with certain melodies.

1:09:42.792 --> 1:09:43.875
You can start anywhere.

1:09:44.583 --> 1:09:48.208
You just chip away at it,
until you eventually can
pull the whole thing together.

1:09:48.458 --> 1:09:51.208
Kate really does have
this prodigious work ethic.

1:09:51.291 --> 1:09:54.583
We just drilled it and worked
it, and it was constant.

1:09:54.999 --> 1:09:57.375
SUSAN: She was utterly
committed to doing this well,

1:09:57.458 --> 1:10:00.500
to doing it properly,
to honoring the local culture.

1:10:00.750 --> 1:10:02.917
And being able to shoot locally
like that is very helpful.

1:10:03.208 --> 1:10:06.625
CRAIG ZOBEL: We were really
trying to be as specific
as we could to the area.

1:10:06.833 --> 1:10:09.291
In addition to that, we would
like do it with costume.

1:10:09.541 --> 1:10:13.875
Our costume designer
would be texting me pictures
from the Wawa convenience store.

1:10:13.958 --> 1:10:15.750
Just of people in the line.

1:10:15.833 --> 1:10:19.375
KATE: We would spend
so much time distressing
every item of clothing

1:10:19.667 --> 1:10:22.541
with scrubbing brushes
and putting holes in things

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:24.625
and all her clothes
feel like clothes.

1:10:24.708 --> 1:10:26.083
They don't feel like costumes.

1:10:26.166 --> 1:10:28.500
I told the costume designer
that I wanted to wear

1:10:28.583 --> 1:10:30.291
hip pads and butt pads.

1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:32.375
And she practically cried
she was so happy.

1:10:32.458 --> 1:10:35.333
She said, "Actresses
never ask me for that!"

1:10:35.792 --> 1:10:37.792
Uh, we're just asking anyone
who knows anything

1:10:37.875 --> 1:10:39.625
to please come forward.

1:10:40.792 --> 1:10:42.500
Maybe it's a serial killer.

1:10:42.917 --> 1:10:44.083
Christ, Mom.

1:10:44.416 --> 1:10:46.875
Well, I mean,
it is the third girl, Mare.

1:10:46.958 --> 1:10:48.083
♪ (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS) ♪

1:10:48.416 --> 1:10:51.708
CRAIG:
A thing that became clear to me
while making the show

1:10:51.792 --> 1:10:55.416
was that we were really talking
about people who'd been affected

1:10:55.500 --> 1:10:58.958
by trauma, trying to learn
to move on from their trauma.

1:10:59.375 --> 1:11:01.833
ANGOURIE RICE: There's a scene
where Siobhan comes home.

1:11:02.041 --> 1:11:05.917
That's when all of the things
that she hasn't been able to say

1:11:05.999 --> 1:11:08.208
or hasn't been allowed to say,
come out.

1:11:08.291 --> 1:11:10.583
-You don't even talk about him.
-MARE SHEEHAN: What are you
talking about, Siobhan?

1:11:10.667 --> 1:11:12.500
-Come on. Hey, come on--
-You don't even talk about him
anymore.

1:11:12.583 --> 1:11:13.792
And I hate you for that,
I hate you!

1:11:13.875 --> 1:11:15.416
You should have been the one
to find him.

1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:17.458
-MARE: Stop!
-Not me, not me!

1:11:17.958 --> 1:11:21.583
When I first read that scene
in the script, I just cried.

1:11:21.667 --> 1:11:22.667
Sometimes as an actor,

1:11:22.750 --> 1:11:25.416
it's just horrible
shooting certain scenes.

1:11:25.708 --> 1:11:27.458
And that scene
was very upsetting

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:29.458
and, uh, extremely painful.

1:11:29.750 --> 1:11:31.875
Kate and Angourie and I
had a conversation

1:11:32.166 --> 1:11:34.541
about what is going
to make us feel

1:11:34.625 --> 1:11:36.458
like we've achieved
a real moment.

1:11:36.541 --> 1:11:39.792
Maybe have less people on set
and not necessarily have

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:41.458
the time pressure
that we would have

1:11:41.541 --> 1:11:43.333
in a different scenario.

1:11:43.416 --> 1:11:46.041
It was very, kind of,
intimate and personal.

1:11:46.291 --> 1:11:48.500
It was just heartbreaking
to film.

1:11:48.708 --> 1:11:51.333
It was very hard
to differentiate

1:11:51.416 --> 1:11:54.208
between wanting to support
and help Angary

1:11:54.291 --> 1:11:56.625
in performing the scene,
and having to also

1:11:56.999 --> 1:12:00.375
keep so much reserved
because that's how Mare
handles the scene.

1:12:00.458 --> 1:12:01.625
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:12:01.708 --> 1:12:02.833
(SOBBING)

1:12:02.917 --> 1:12:05.875
Kate, as an actor,
she's so able to just

1:12:06.124 --> 1:12:09.041
cover a gamut of emotions
and qualities

1:12:09.124 --> 1:12:12.083
where you can see Mare
being super focused

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:13.375
on the work she's doing,

1:12:13.458 --> 1:12:16.375
but at the same time is able to,
sort of, very closely

1:12:16.458 --> 1:12:18.625
under the surface
is a very vulnerable woman

1:12:18.708 --> 1:12:21.083
who needs to be loved
and wants to love, too.

1:12:21.458 --> 1:12:24.208
Yeah, I think this was
kind of a one-time thing.

1:12:24.291 --> 1:12:25.541
Well, does it have to be?

1:12:25.917 --> 1:12:27.416
My life's complicated.

1:12:27.667 --> 1:12:31.208
It was really clear for me
to see where Richard

1:12:31.291 --> 1:12:32.667
would fit into her life,

1:12:32.750 --> 1:12:36.999
and what was required to be
some sort of relief for Mare.

1:12:37.625 --> 1:12:39.083
Do you ever
give yourself a break?

1:12:39.667 --> 1:12:41.375
Are you about to tell me
I look exhausted?

1:12:41.458 --> 1:12:42.583
No, but it seems like

1:12:42.667 --> 1:12:45.083
you're carrying
a lot of heavy stuff,

1:12:45.166 --> 1:12:48.750
and I, you know,
I wonder if anybody
ever does anything for you.

1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:52.999
BRAD: We are dealing with dark
and tragic events in the show.

1:12:53.083 --> 1:12:55.667
But I think
in order for an audience

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:57.958
to wanna stick around each week,

1:12:58.041 --> 1:13:00.708
it can't be too heavy
all the time.

1:13:00.792 --> 1:13:02.750
And so, the show has
a lot of humor in it.

1:13:03.041 --> 1:13:06.083
CRAIG: There's a scene where
Evan says, "Goodnight, Mare."

1:13:06.166 --> 1:13:09.083
And in one of the rehearsals,
the way he delivered it,

1:13:09.166 --> 1:13:10.041
he was like...

1:13:10.124 --> 1:13:11.291
Have a good nightmare!

1:13:12.458 --> 1:13:13.999
Goodnight, Mare.

1:13:14.541 --> 1:13:15.750
Why don't you have a good night,
Mare?

1:13:15.833 --> 1:13:17.833
Craig and I thought
that was absolutely hilarious.

1:13:17.917 --> 1:13:19.583
And I was like, "Wait,
just say that the next time."

1:13:19.667 --> 1:13:21.458
And so,
we shot some of these things

1:13:21.541 --> 1:13:23.999
that ended up in the show,
and messing around

1:13:24.083 --> 1:13:25.750
and kind of finding it on set.

1:13:25.999 --> 1:13:30.333
The first scene I shot was fun.
It's where we're at the funeral.

1:13:30.416 --> 1:13:31.708
Listen up!

1:13:31.792 --> 1:13:33.541
HELEN: And then
he announces out of guilt

1:13:33.625 --> 1:13:35.917
in front of everyone
at his wife's wake.

1:13:36.208 --> 1:13:37.458
I had an affair...

1:13:37.667 --> 1:13:39.416
with Helen Fahey.

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:40.375
(MARE GRUNTS)

1:13:40.458 --> 1:13:42.792
BRAD:
In spite of these tragic events,

1:13:42.875 --> 1:13:44.833
there's a lot of laughter
in this community.

1:13:44.917 --> 1:13:46.541
-(LAUGHING)
-Li-- Li-- Listen to me.

1:13:46.625 --> 1:13:48.625
"Affair" is a strong word.
Very strong.

1:13:48.708 --> 1:13:52.583
-It happened twice.
-(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

1:13:52.667 --> 1:13:54.166
Okay, three times, tops.

1:13:54.958 --> 1:13:56.416
CRAIG:
The Wayne Potts sequence was

1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:59.208
a particularly fun sequence
to design.

1:13:59.291 --> 1:14:01.708
The location that we found was
a real location

1:14:01.792 --> 1:14:04.833
that was a bar in the front
and a house in the back.

1:14:04.917 --> 1:14:06.541
The set decoration was
incredible

1:14:06.625 --> 1:14:08.333
and just looked
so real and scary.

1:14:08.667 --> 1:14:11.625
KATE: Logistically, we had
to really understand the space.

1:14:11.708 --> 1:14:13.792
We had to understand exactly
what would happen to Evan.

1:14:13.875 --> 1:14:17.249
I think they did a countdown
like, "Three, two, one, bang!"

1:14:17.541 --> 1:14:18.875
-(GUNSHOT)
-(GRUNTS)

1:14:18.958 --> 1:14:20.208
They shot me doing that,

1:14:20.291 --> 1:14:23.291
and then set up a pyrotechnic
that had blood in it,

1:14:23.375 --> 1:14:25.500
and then shot that...
(IMITATES SPLATTERING)

1:14:25.583 --> 1:14:26.667
...going on the wall.

1:14:27.041 --> 1:14:29.291
And then the rest of the day,
I had a bullet hole in my face,

1:14:29.375 --> 1:14:30.458
and I was laying on the ground.

1:14:30.541 --> 1:14:32.375
(LAUGHS) Kate was running
all around my head,

1:14:32.458 --> 1:14:35.166
and I'm like, "Please don't
step on me." (LAUGHS)

1:14:35.917 --> 1:14:38.792
I had never held a gun
before playing this part.

1:14:38.875 --> 1:14:40.667
-(GUNSHOTS)
-(MARE GASPS)

1:14:40.750 --> 1:14:43.792
We didn't want her to come
off as an action star.

1:14:43.875 --> 1:14:45.458
We wanted to make sure
that it read

1:14:45.541 --> 1:14:49.083
as an unusual event
in the life of Mare Sheehan.

1:14:49.875 --> 1:14:52.667
BRAD: The hardest part
of any mystery show really is

1:14:52.750 --> 1:14:53.958
sticking the landing.

1:14:54.041 --> 1:14:55.792
The ending has to be surprising,

1:14:55.875 --> 1:14:57.875
and yet it has to be rewarding
as well.

1:14:58.249 --> 1:15:00.708
JULIANNE NICHOLSON:
I was not able to predict
what was coming,

1:15:00.792 --> 1:15:02.875
which is exciting. You wanna be
a part of something

1:15:02.958 --> 1:15:04.833
where you don't know
what's coming next.

1:15:04.958 --> 1:15:07.999
I always, like, theorize
about who'd done it,

1:15:08.083 --> 1:15:09.124
and I never get it right.

1:15:09.208 --> 1:15:10.500
So I was very shocked.

1:15:10.583 --> 1:15:12.792
In a small town,
you have the opportunity

1:15:12.875 --> 1:15:13.999
to sort of investigate
all the families

1:15:14.083 --> 1:15:16.208
and to see the effects
that the crime has had

1:15:16.291 --> 1:15:18.667
and get involved
in everybody's personal stories.

1:15:18.750 --> 1:15:21.249
The suspect is wanted
in a murder investigation.

1:15:21.583 --> 1:15:22.667
JULIANNE: The truth comes out,

1:15:22.750 --> 1:15:24.249
and then the worst thing
in the world

1:15:24.333 --> 1:15:27.083
that you can imagine,
as a mother, happens.

1:15:27.416 --> 1:15:32.041
I think that moment in the car
where Lori blows up at Mare,

1:15:32.124 --> 1:15:33.999
she's been holding
on to so much,

1:15:34.083 --> 1:15:36.667
that it's just a moment
where it all comes out.

1:15:36.917 --> 1:15:40.375
Why couldn't you just leave it
alone? It's my Ryan!

1:15:40.458 --> 1:15:41.667
My Ryan!

1:15:41.750 --> 1:15:44.958
Lori's life is completely ruined
because Mare figures it out.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:47.833
CRAIG: We wanted
to make sure that landed

1:15:47.917 --> 1:15:49.541
as a surprise and a twist,

1:15:49.625 --> 1:15:50.958
but that you would have empathy

1:15:51.041 --> 1:15:52.875
for characters
that you didn't before.

1:15:52.958 --> 1:15:55.667
KATE: We worked so hard
to keep it a secret.

1:15:55.750 --> 1:15:59.124
I hope that the audience
is as blown away as we all were

1:15:59.208 --> 1:16:01.166
by who the real killer is.
