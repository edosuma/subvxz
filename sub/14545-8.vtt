WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.837
NOW BEFORE THIS, UH, TURKEY
GETS TOO NERVOUS

00:03.871 --> 00:05.739
THAT BO WILL ESCAPE AND...

00:05.773 --> 00:09.043
STUPID, STUPID TRADITION.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.845
OH, LOOK AT US.
WE'RE PARDONING A TURKEY.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.082
(Tessa) AND IF HE CAN GET
A REPRIEVE ON THANKSGIVING,

00:14.115 --> 00:15.549
WHY CAN'T I?

00:15.583 --> 00:18.119
WHY CAN'T I, MALIA?

00:18.152 --> 00:19.487
(clatters)

00:19.520 --> 00:21.655
(President Obama)
YOU ARE HEREBY PARDONED.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.591
(Tessa) THANKSGIVING IS
A TIME FOR TRADITION,

00:23.624 --> 00:25.326
AND MOVING TO CHATSWIN MEANT
THE END OF OURS.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.365
EVERY YEAR, GEORGE AND I USED
TO GO TO CENTRAL PARK TO WATCH

00:31.399 --> 00:33.534
THE FLOATS GET BLOWN UP
FOR THE PARADE.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.636
THEN WE'D GO
TO OUR FAVORITE COFFEE SHOP

00:35.669 --> 00:36.570
FOR TURKEY BURGERS

00:36.604 --> 00:37.605
AND BLACK-AND-WHITE
MILK SHAKES.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.374
TRY AND ORDER A BLACK-AND-WHITE
IN CHATSWIN,

00:40.408 --> 00:43.144
AND YOU'D JUST GET THE WHITE.
(doorbell rings)

00:43.177 --> 00:45.779
(George) TESSA, YOU GOT IT?

00:45.813 --> 00:46.780
YEAH.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.485
GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.653
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.889
GOOD MORROW, CHILD.
WHERE BE YOUR PA?

00:55.923 --> 00:59.093
UH, I THINK HE'S
ON THE CAN. WHO ARE YOU?

00:59.127 --> 01:02.130
WHY, JASPER THE PILGRIM.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.533
CHILD, THE FAMILY OF ROYCE
AWAITS THINE R.S.V.P.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.667
TO THEIR BOUNTIFUL
THANKSGIVING FEAST.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.905
YOU GUYS FORGOT TO R.S.V.P.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.375
OH! RIGHT. THE DALLAS THING.
WE'LL BE THERE.

01:14.408 --> 01:18.212
"JOYOUS NEWS!" AS OUR
FOREFATHERS MIGHT PROCLAIM.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.913
REALLY?
WELL, YOU'RE A MEAN GIRL

01:19.947 --> 01:23.584
WITH AN UNKIND HEART
WHO HAS NO HOLIDAY CHEER.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.920
THANKSGIVING AT THE ROYCES'.
GONNA BE FUN.

01:26.954 --> 01:27.855
DEFINE FUN.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.423
NOAH'S FAMILY'S
GONNA BE THERE.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.891
YOU SHOULD CALL
"WEBSTER'S."

01:30.924 --> 01:32.660
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW FAR APART YOU GUYS ARE.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.595
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE BUMMED WE'RE
NOT DOING OUR OLD TRADITION,

01:34.628 --> 01:37.231
BUT WE'RE MAKING
A NEW TRADITION.

01:37.265 --> 01:40.201
DO YOU EVEN OWN A DICTIONARY?
TRADITIONS AREN'T NEW.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.236
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM...
TRADITIONS.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.304
MM-HMM.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.373
BESIDES, I KNOW YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO KEEP US APART.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.541
KEEP WHO APART?
MANHATTAN AND ME.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.243
YOU'RE AFRAID.
IF I SEE HER AGAIN,

01:49.277 --> 01:50.744
THE OLD FEELINGS MIGHT COME
RUSHING BACK.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.281
(chuckles) OH, YES.
I KNOW HOW SERIOUS YOU TWO ARE,

01:53.314 --> 01:55.149
AND I MISS HER, TOO,
BUT WE ARE WITH THE SUBURBS NOW,

01:55.183 --> 01:56.950
AND IF SHE CATCHES US
LOOKING AT OTHER CITIES--

01:56.984 --> 01:58.386
SHE MIGHT CUT OFF
YOUR CUL-DE-SAC?

01:58.419 --> 01:59.787
(chuckles) AND YOU KNOW
I'M PRETTY ATTACHED

01:59.820 --> 02:00.921
TO MY CUL-DE-SAC.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.290
YOU'RE GROSS.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.324
YOU'RE GROSS.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.827

Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

A PLEASANT NIGHTMARE *

HEY, NEIGHBOR.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.544
GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.679
DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
SAY "GOBBLE, GOBBLE"?

02:25.713 --> 02:30.184
IT MAKES ME WANT TO KILL THEM...
AND THEN EAT THEM.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.186
ON THANKSGIVING DAY,
HALF A DOZEN MEMBERS

02:32.220 --> 02:34.555
OF THE SHAY FAMILY
WILL DESCEND UPON OUR HOUSE

02:34.588 --> 02:35.923
TO EAT WITH THEIR MOUTH OPEN

02:35.956 --> 02:40.261
AND DISPENSE
UNSOLICITED ADVICE...

02:40.294 --> 02:43.464
MOST OF WHICH WILL BE
ABOUT MY HAIR.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.365
GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.299
YOU SHOULD SEE
THIS DRESS THAT MY MOTHER'S

02:45.333 --> 02:47.468
TRYING TO MAKE ME WEAR.
IT'S FRICKIN' AMISH.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.237
MAYBE YOU SHOULD MOVE TO EUROPE
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.539
THEY DON'T HAVE
THANKSGIVING IN EUROPE.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.375
LIKE MY MOTHER WOULD EVER
LET ME MOVE TO EUROPE.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.709
SHE'S CONVINCED ALL BELGIANS
ARE SEX OFFENDERS.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.520
WAIT. WHAT IF YOU JUST
TELL YOUR MOM

03:06.554 --> 03:08.489
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
THE DRESS?

03:12.793 --> 03:13.361
(doorbell rings)

03:13.394 --> 03:14.428
(dog yapping)

03:14.462 --> 03:16.397
YAKULT! NO!
COME HERE, GIRL.

03:16.430 --> 03:20.534
(Dallas) GET DOWN, YAKULT.
GET DOWN. NO, STOP IT.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.503
HEY. I-I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A DOG.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.838
WELL, SHE'S NEW. I JUST GOT
HER FROM THE BREEDER.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.507
SHE'S A SNICKERDOODLE.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.442
I-I THINK THAT'S A COOKIE.

03:28.476 --> 03:32.313
OH. OKAY, MAYBE SHE'S
A SCHNITZELDOODLE.

03:32.346 --> 03:35.449
ANYWHO, SHE'S SOME KIND
OF DOODLE, AREN'T YA, YAKULT?

03:35.483 --> 03:36.817
(high-pitched voice)
AREN'T YOU, GOOD GIRL?

03:36.850 --> 03:38.652
YAKULT? IS THAT HEBREW?

03:38.686 --> 03:39.620
(chuckles) NO, SILLY.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.623
SHE'S NAMED AFTER
MY FAVORITE PROBIOTIC DRINK.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.025
OH. OKAY.
I-I NEED TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.594
I'M UP
FOR THIS REALLY BIG JOB.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.362
OH, CONGRATS, GEORGE.
WELL, HOLD ON.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.930
THERE'S STILL ONE FINAL HOOP
I NEED TO JUMP THROUGH.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.332
IN FACT,
I REALLY GOTTA GET GOING.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.266
WELL, DON'T LET ME
KEEP YOU.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.435
N-NO, NO, DALLAS.
THE REASON I STOPPED BY IS

03:54.468 --> 03:56.604
BECAUSE TESSA'S
A LITTLE BUMMED OUT

03:56.637 --> 03:57.905
ABOUT BEING IN CHATSWIN
THIS TIME OF YEAR...

03:57.938 --> 03:59.072
OHH.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.508
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IF YOU WERE
DOING SOMETHING FUN TODAY,

04:00.541 --> 04:01.509
SHE COULD TAG ALONG.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.011
OH, MY GOSH. YES. I'M ALWAYS
DOING SOMETHING FUN.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.646
EVEN WHEN I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING FUN,

04:05.679 --> 04:08.882
IT'S USUALLY STILL
PRETTY FUN. I'M YOUR GIRL.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.351
YOU REALLY ARE.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.787
(kisses)

04:13.821 --> 04:15.589
MY GOODNESS, YAKULT.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.861
LISA MARIE SHAY.

04:20.894 --> 04:24.498
ALL THE GIRL COUSINS
ARE WEARING THE DRESS.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.434
ALL THE GIRL COUSINS
BUT ONE.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.336
MAKE LIFE EASY.
WEAR THE DRESS.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.438
WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILY PHOTO
FOR NANA?

04:30.471 --> 04:33.006
IF YOU'RE NOT WEARING THE DRESS,
WE MAY AS WELL TAKE A PHOTO

04:33.040 --> 04:36.109
OF A BUNCH OF GODLESS,
SEX-CRAZED BELGIANS.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.378
I'M SURE NANA
WOULD LOVE THAT.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.312
THIS IS JUST LIKE
WHEN SHE WANTED

04:38.346 --> 04:39.413
TO STOP USING CONDITIONER.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.114
I BROKE FOUR COMBS
ON THAT HEAD OF HAIR!

04:41.148 --> 04:44.385
I REMEMBER. UH, COMBS DON'T
GROW ON TREES, LISA.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.688
FRED, IS THAT ANOTHER BOWL
OF CEREAL?! IT IS 11:00 A.M.!

04:47.721 --> 04:49.657
(clinks)

04:49.690 --> 04:51.692
LISA, IF YOU WANT TO BE
A PARTY POOPER,

04:51.725 --> 04:53.694
YOU CAN GO POOP
IN YOUR ROOM,

04:53.727 --> 04:54.862
AND IF YOU MISS
THANKSGIVING TOMORROW,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.897
YOU HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME
BUT YOURSELF.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.032
FINE.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.702
(sighs) THIS IS A PERFECTLY
HANDSOME CALICO DRESS.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.970
(door closes)

05:03.003 --> 05:04.838
MM-HMM. OH, YEAH.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.075
DON'T CONDESCEND TO ME.
(sighs)

05:08.108 --> 05:10.411
LISA HAD BEEN BANISHED
TO HER ROOM.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.580
MEANWHILE, I WAS ABOUT
TO BE SUBJECTED

05:12.613 --> 05:14.748
TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF TORTURE
ENTIRELY.

05:14.782 --> 05:18.719
TESSA, I KNOW YOU PRIDE YOURSELF
ON BEING UNKEMPT,

05:18.752 --> 05:22.490
BUT I THINK YOU WOULD LOOK HOT
WITH A BRAZILIAN.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.591
BEG PARDON?

05:23.624 --> 05:24.958
A BRAZILIAN BLOWOUT--

05:24.992 --> 05:28.161
SUPER STRAIGHT HAIR,
REAL SMOOTH, POLISHED,

05:28.195 --> 05:30.464
INSTEAD OF THAT LITTLE
KINK-PILE YOU GOT GOING,

05:30.498 --> 05:33.901
AND TRUST ME, HONEY,
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.103
WHY WOULD FLAT HAIR
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.805
TESSA, THERE ARE
CERTAIN SECRETS IN LIFE

05:37.838 --> 05:41.108
THAT ONLY A WOMAN CAN TEACH YOU,
AND ONE OF THEM IS,

05:41.141 --> 05:44.812
WHEN YOU LOOK BETTER,
YOU FEEL BETTER.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.614
OH! AND ANOTHER ONE IS...
(packaging rustles)

05:46.647 --> 05:49.182
YOU CAN STILL GET BUGLES
ON THE INTERNET. (crunches)

05:49.216 --> 05:51.118
YEAH, I DON'T CARE ABOUT
EITHER OF THOSE TWO THINGS.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.921
OH, COME ON.
WE CAN DO IT SIDE BY SIDE.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.889
SIT RIGHT THERE,
AND WE CAN BOTH GET BLOWN.

05:55.923 --> 05:56.724
NO.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.793
PRETTY PLEASE
WITH A $100 BILL ON TOP.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.194
NOT EVEN ON MY DEAD BODY.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.031
OH, NO. THAT KIND OF HAIR IS
ALL WRONG FOR A DEAD BODY.

06:04.064 --> 06:08.402
YOU'D WANT AN UPDO
OR A LOOSE BRAID OR A SIDE PONY.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.404
TESSA,
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.172
YOU BLOW OUT YOUR HAIR WITH ME
FOR THANKSGIVING,

06:12.205 --> 06:14.708
AND I WILL TAKE YOU
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE

06:14.742 --> 06:16.577
YOU WANT TO GO
FOR LUNCH TODAY.

06:16.610 --> 06:20.948
**

06:20.981 --> 06:22.983
ANYWHERE?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.852
(AgesandAges'
"Alright You Restless" playing)

06:32.025 --> 06:34.227
(turns stereo volume up)

06:34.261 --> 06:36.063
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
SAID ANYWHERE.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.164
* ALRIGHT, YOU RESTLESS,
ARISE *

06:37.197 --> 06:38.999
* AND MAKE BELIEVE
IT ISN'T DANGEROUS *

06:43.036 --> 06:44.838
SO HERE'S THE SITCH.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.576
AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW, I'M
A PROFESSIONAL PARTY PLANNER,

06:48.609 --> 06:49.710
SO MY MOM PUT ME IN CHARGE

06:49.743 --> 06:51.178
OF PROFESSIONALLY PLANNING
THIS PARTY.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.680
(Yakult yapping)
OH, MY GOD.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.247
SHUT UP, YAKULT!
I HATE YOU!

06:54.281 --> 06:56.584
(yaps)

06:56.617 --> 06:59.553
NOW I'M SURE WE ALL REMEMBER
THAT LAST YEAR SUCKED.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.622
I'M TALKING ABOUT
CLUMPY-ASS MASHED POTATOES

07:01.655 --> 07:04.492
AND PALE, FLACCID
STRING BEANS, ALAN.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.060
YOU'D BETTER COME CORRECT,
OR I SWEAR TO GOD,

07:07.094 --> 07:08.929
YOU'RE GONNA GET SERVED.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.098
HAPPY THANKSGIVING, PUMPKIN.
GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.001
HEY, DAD. GOBBLE, GOBBLE.
LONG TIME NO SEE.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.803
ALL RIGHT. UH-OH. SHOES.
(clatters)

07:15.836 --> 07:18.005
DID YOU FORGET WE HAVE A NO-SHOE
POLICY HERE IN THE HOUSE?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.507
YEAH, WE DON'T DO THAT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.242
WHY? I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DADDY'S GIRL, HUH?

07:22.275 --> 07:23.376
(shoes clatter)
SHOULD I RETURN

07:23.410 --> 07:25.479
THE CASHMERE HORSE BLANKET
I GOT FOR YOUR HORSE CASHMERE?

07:25.513 --> 07:27.080
NO, N--

07:27.114 --> 07:29.249
DADDY, YOU KNOW CASHMERE
LOVES CASHMERE.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.718
I KNOW.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.553
DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER.
LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

07:32.586 --> 07:33.621
'KAY.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.888
(whispering) OKAY.
I'M GONNA NAP.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.156
CALL ME IF ANYONE CALLS ME.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.058
ALL RIGHT. GO ON. OKAY.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.860
(yaps and growls)

07:39.893 --> 07:42.596
WHO ARE YOU?

07:42.630 --> 07:43.964
(horns honking)

07:43.997 --> 07:45.933
I PROMISED GEORGE I'D GET YOU
EXCITED ABOUT CHATSWIN,

07:45.966 --> 07:49.036
AND WHAT DO I DO?
I BRING YOU INTO THE CITY.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.639
I MEAN, WHY DOES GEORGE
EVEN HAVE TO KNOW?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.273
THIS CAN JUST BE
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.808
(gasps) OH, MY GOSH.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.645
GUCCIS JUST LAYIN'
ON THE SIDEWALK.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.146
I LIKE THAT ONE.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.180
15.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.916
15? 15 WHAT?

08:02.950 --> 08:03.984
DOLLARS.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.086
THEY'RE COUNTERFEIT.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.288
(gasps)
CAN WE HAVE TWO SECRETS?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.090
YES, WE CAN.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.926
OHH, I WILL TAKE...
OOH, I'LL TAKE THE CHANEL...

08:12.960 --> 08:15.095
CHANEL.
AND THE PRADA
AND THAT--AND THAT GUCCI.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.765
AND THE GUCCI. (grunts)

08:17.798 --> 08:18.832
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

08:18.866 --> 08:22.636
THIS IS ALREADY FUN.
(gasps) OH, MY GOSH! SUNGLASSES.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.538
(clicking)

08:27.074 --> 08:28.642
HOW MANY POTATOES
DO WE NEED?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.844
IT'S YOUR FAMILY, FRED.
YOU TELL ME.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.647
WELL, THEY DO LOVE
THEIR POTATOES. (chuckles)

08:33.681 --> 08:34.915
LISA'S NOT WEARING
THE DRESS?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.016
THAT'S T.B.D.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.887
IT IS NOT T.B.D. IT IS "D."
SHE IS WEARING THE DRESS.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.022
'CAUSE IF SHE'S NOT WEARING
THE DRESS,

08:42.055 --> 08:43.791
I'M NOT WEARING THE VEST.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.727
YOU HAPPY, FRED?
IT'S ANARCHY.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.328
OKAY, LET'S NOT GET
HYSTERICAL.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.031
WHY DON'T WE SAY WE JUST FOCUS
ON THE POTATOES, ALL RIGHT?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.701
YOU WANNA BOIL 'EM,
OR YOU WANNA NUKE 'EM?

08:53.734 --> 08:55.035
I WANT TO NUKE 'EM.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.269
ALL RIGHT.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.441
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.110
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO, FRED.
I AM TURNING UP THE HEAT.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.211
WHY?

09:04.244 --> 09:06.814
WHY? BECAUSE HEAT RISES.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.583
I'VE GOT LESS THAN 24 HOURS
TO GET HER INTO THAT DRESS,

09:09.617 --> 09:12.085
SO IT'S NO MORE
MRS. NICE GUY.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.954
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T
SEEN MRS. NICE GUY

09:13.987 --> 09:15.388
SINCE THE HONEYMOON.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.057
(chuckles) STOP.
(chuckles)

09:17.090 --> 09:18.158
(both laughing)

09:18.191 --> 09:20.861
STOP IT. OHH.
COME ON. STOP IT.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.796
I SAID, "STOP IT," FRED!

09:26.433 --> 09:27.801
SORRY.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.707
I'LL TAKE IT.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.842
WHAT?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.010
I LOVE IT. I WANT IT.
I HAVE TO HAVE IT.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.912
I'LL TAKE IT.
WHERE DO WE PAY?

09:38.946 --> 09:41.414
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.
IT BELONGS TO THE MUSEUM.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.150
HONEY, EVERYTHING HAS
A PRICE.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.755
BUT SERIOUSLY,
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.757
WE'LL SEE.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.191
SO NOW WE DON'T SIT DOWN?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.861
NO, WE DON'T SIT DOWN,
'CAUSE WE HAVE PLACES TO GO.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.162
AND YET WE DON'T HAIL
A CAB?

09:55.195 --> 09:56.429
NO, WE DON'T HAIL A CAB.

09:56.463 --> 10:00.634
AS WE WALK,
WE FOLD, DRIP, AND BITE.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.903
OH, THAT'S JUST FILTHY.

10:02.936 --> 10:03.971
(splats)

10:04.004 --> 10:05.105
IS THAT PART OF IT?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.640
(splat)

10:06.674 --> 10:08.008
(car alarm blaring,
horns honking)

10:08.041 --> 10:11.278
(indistinct conversations)

10:11.311 --> 10:13.113
THAT LYING SON OF A...

10:13.146 --> 10:14.381
(horn blaring)

10:16.383 --> 10:17.685
(horn stops blaring)

10:17.718 --> 10:18.719
(both) BITCH.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.757
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.793
I CAN'T BELIEVE GEORGE HAS BEEN
CHEATING ON THE SUBURBS

10:25.826 --> 10:26.827
WITH MANHATTAN.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.028
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WOMAN.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.797
SHE LOOKED DOWNRIGHT
PUERTO RICAN.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.364
HOW OLD DO YOU SUPPOSE
SHE WAS?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.265
HE LIED TO ME.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.735
AND WHAT KIND OF HANDBAG
WAS SHE CARRYING?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.937
(chuckles) 'CAUSE I CERTAINLY
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.005
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO WORK.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.306
LOOKED LIKE
SOME SORT OF TOTE,

10:39.339 --> 10:42.009
LIKE SOME KIND
OF PLEDGE DRIVE FREEBIE.

10:42.042 --> 10:45.145
HE'S BUSTED.
GEORGE IS SO BUSTED.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.981
NOW, TESSA, YOU MAY AS WELL
JUST FORGET YOU SAW ANY OF THAT,

10:48.015 --> 10:49.817
'CAUSE YOU AND I WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE CITY,

10:49.850 --> 10:54.321
SO TECHNICALLY, WE DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING, RIGHT?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.757
RIGHT?

10:56.790 --> 10:57.925
(sighs)

11:02.495 --> 11:03.897
(knock on door)

11:03.931 --> 11:05.966
GO AWAY, MOTHER.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.968
(lowered voice)
DUDE, IT'S ME.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.002
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:09.036 --> 11:12.005
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS COOL.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.508
IT'S REALLY COOL. HERE.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.177
IT'S LIKE
WHEN I SAW ACE VENTURA

11:17.210 --> 11:19.479
IN THAT SUPER CONFUSING
"SPOTLESS SUNSHINE" MOVIE

11:19.512 --> 11:23.016
THAT HAD THE "TITANIC" LADY
WITH THE MIDSIZED NATURALS.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.718
WELL, THE MOVIE
PRETTY MUCH SUCKED,

11:24.752 --> 11:27.220
BUT I RESPECTED ACE VENTURA
FOR TAKING A RISK,

11:27.254 --> 11:29.723
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.725
YOU ARE TAKING A RISK!

11:31.759 --> 11:33.193
YEAH.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.029
YEAH.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.232
HEY. IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FINISH THAT, CAN I HAVE IT?

11:39.266 --> 11:42.169
IT'S THE LAST ONE,
AND IT'S SUPER HOT IN HERE.

11:42.202 --> 11:55.816
SURE.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.450
(sighs)

11:57.484 --> 11:57.517
(gulping)

11:59.119 --> 11:59.853
AHH.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.088
(inhales deeply and sighs)
THANKS.

12:01.121 --> 12:01.154
YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.327
(door opens and closes)

12:07.360 --> 12:09.362
THANKSGIVING DAY IN CHATSWIN,

12:09.396 --> 12:11.498
AND I COULDN'T HELP
BUT WONDER WHAT OTHER SECRETS

12:11.531 --> 12:13.566
GEORGE HAD BEEN KEEPING
FROM ME,

12:13.600 --> 12:13.633
IF THAT WAS EVEN HIS NAME.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.109
YOUR HAIR LOOKS NICE.
IS IT DIFFERENT?

12:22.142 --> 12:25.412
YES, IT IS.
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.247
YURI.

12:27.280 --> 12:27.781
WHAT?

12:27.815 --> 12:27.848
WHAT?

12:31.518 --> 12:32.585
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE MAD,

12:32.619 --> 12:35.155
AND I'M--I'M SORRY WE MISSED
OUT ON THE BALLOONS, BUT--

12:35.188 --> 12:39.026
I'M NOT MAD ABOUT THE BALLOONS.
I'M MAD ABOUT THE HYPOCRISY.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.361
WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT
THE CASINOS NOW,

12:41.394 --> 12:45.065
SO IT MAY JUST BE A BAND-AID,
BUT IT'S A START.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.303
(doorbell rings)

12:50.337 --> 12:52.039
(gasps, singsong voice)
GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.173
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, SHEILA.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.042
(kisses)
OH, THANKS FOR HAVING US.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.477
WHEW. IS IT A MILLION DEGREES
IN HERE OR WHAT?

12:57.510 --> 12:58.445
(chuckles)
YOU'RE MENOPAUSAL, TRISH.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.047
(lowered voice)
OH, I WOULDN'T BRING THAT UP.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.114
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.015
I KNOW WHAT IT IS, GARY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ME.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.951
(chuckles) IT'S MENOPAUSE,
NOT ALZHEIMER'S.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.518
HERE WE GO. (normal voice)
YES. HI. (chuckles)

13:05.552 --> 13:06.486
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GARY.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.888
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, FRED.
(Fred and Trish chuckle)

13:07.921 --> 13:09.422
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, TRISH.
OKAY.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.124
(chuckles) IS THIS
THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE

13:11.158 --> 13:12.893
OR WHAT?
AREN'T THEY ADORABLE, FRED?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.828
TINY LITTLE PILGRIM ANGELS.
(chuckles)

13:14.862 --> 13:17.030
WHERE'S LISA?
WHERE'S LISA?

13:17.064 --> 13:18.565
LISA--
LISA'S BASTING.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.033
SHE IS BASTING.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.536
(yapping)

13:23.570 --> 13:26.506
WELCOME TO
THE ROYCE FAMILY THANKSGIVING.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.442
OH, MY GOD. DROP DEAD, YAKULT!
I WISH YOU WERE NEVER BORN!

13:29.476 --> 13:34.147
OH! THERE ARE THE WERNERS.
HEY, JILL. WHAT IS SHE WEARING?

13:34.181 --> 13:37.550
LOOK AT ALL THAT PURPLE.
SHE LOOKS LIKE A SKINNY GRAPE.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.119
PARK 'EM CAR. (chuckles)

13:39.152 --> 13:42.856
NOAH, STOP IT. I'M GONNA ASK YOU
NOT TO ADJUST THE SEATS.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.325
ALL RIGHT, YOU BE CAREFUL
IN THOSE HIGH HEELS, GORGEOUS.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.127
GOBBLE, GOBBLE. (chuckles)
GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.228
FOUNDERS OR FEATHERS?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.363
YOU'RE A RACIST.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.231
OH, SHE'S--

13:51.264 --> 13:53.166
HEY. HI. CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.602
CERTAINLY. OUT HERE, SHOES ON,
OR INSIDE, SHOES OFF?

13:55.635 --> 13:58.171
UH, OUT, ON, OKAY?

14:00.407 --> 14:01.608
YOU GOT A DOG
WITHOUT ASKING ME?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.977
WELL, YOU GOT A NEW GIRLFRIEND
WITHOUT ASKING ME.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.212
WHAT? (chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.214
OH, GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH IT,
STEVEN.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.049
I MAY BE OLD-FASHIONED--
OLD-FASHIONED?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.884
YOU GOT... (lowered voice)
YOUR TEENAGE DAUGHTER AN I.U.D.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.452
(lowered voice) THAT WAS
TO INCREASE HER CELL RECEPTION,

14:12.485 --> 14:13.620
AND I TOLD YOU THAT.

14:13.653 --> 14:17.690
SHE NOW HAS FULL SIGNAL, STEVEN.
FULL SIGNAL!

14:17.724 --> 14:21.428
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
(sighs)

14:21.461 --> 14:24.131
OH, MY G--
YAKULT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:24.164 --> 14:27.067
THIS IS WHY WE DON'T WEAR
SHOES IN THE HOUSE!

14:29.236 --> 14:30.670
COME ON, Y--DON'T. DON'T.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.538
DON'T. I LIKE YOU.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.007
IT'S OKAY.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.375
(door creaks)

14:35.408 --> 14:39.412
SHEILA'S ATTEMPT TO SMOKE LISA
OUT OF HER ROOM WAS WORKING,

14:39.446 --> 14:41.148
AND ONCE
LISA'S INTERNAL TEMPERATURE

14:41.181 --> 14:45.618
REACHED THE TRIPLE DIGITS,
SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.303
OHH.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.072
OH.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.007
(latch clicks)

15:07.040 --> 15:08.541
(horror film theme playing)

15:13.580 --> 15:15.515
(glass clinks)

15:15.548 --> 15:19.686
FRIENDS, FAMILY, STEVEN--
YAKULT!

15:22.089 --> 15:24.992
THAT'S A $400 LOAFER,
YAKULT!

15:25.025 --> 15:28.228
FIRST OFF, I'D LIKE TO WISH
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

15:28.261 --> 15:30.097
A HEARTY...
(singsongy) GOBBLE, GOBBLE!

15:30.130 --> 15:31.298
(all) GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.599
(chuckles)
(clinks)

15:32.632 --> 15:33.533
SORRY. THAT'S TOO LOUD.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.602
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK
EVERYBODY FOR COMING

15:35.635 --> 15:39.039
TO THIS GREAT MEAL THAT, UH,
MY WIFE COMMISSIONED

15:39.072 --> 15:41.341
AND MY DAUGHTER
PROFESSIONALLY PLANNED

15:41.374 --> 15:42.575
AND SOMEBODY COOKED.
(chuckles)

15:42.609 --> 15:44.177
I JUST, UH,
I DON'T KNOW WHO COOKED IT.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.446
SIT, STEVEN.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.315
NOW BEFORE WE BEGIN,
I THINK WE SHOULD GO

15:48.348 --> 15:49.782
AROUND THE TABLE
SO THAT EACH OF US CAN

15:49.816 --> 15:53.153
ARTICULATE JUST WHAT IT IS
WE'RE MOST THANKFUL FOR.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.154
NOAH?

15:54.187 --> 15:55.755
OH. UM...
(clears throat)

15:55.788 --> 15:57.690
WELL, UH, AT THE TOP
OF MY LIST, AS ALWAYS,

15:57.724 --> 16:00.160
IS MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE JILL,
WITHOUT WHOM--

16:00.193 --> 16:02.495
WRAP IT UP, NOAH.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.532
SHE KEEPS ME HUMBLE,
SO...

16:08.235 --> 16:11.304
THANKFUL. I'M THANKFUL
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DRESS

16:11.338 --> 16:15.075
LIKE A PROSTITUTE TO ATTRACT
THE ATTENTION OF MY HUSBAND.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.809
SHE LOOKS GOOD IN WOOL.
(chuckles)

16:16.843 --> 16:19.412
I'M THANKFUL THAT I HAVE
MY OWN PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY

16:19.446 --> 16:21.181
OUTSIDE OF MY MARRIAGE.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.015
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

16:22.049 --> 16:24.017
I'M REFERRING
TO MY LATEST GUIDE BOOK,

16:24.051 --> 16:27.287
"UNCORKED--THE WINE COUNTIES
OF CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA."

16:27.320 --> 16:28.355
SELF-PUBLISHED.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.223
AND BEAUTIFULLY BOUND.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.658
(chuckles)
THIS IS A HOSTESS COPY.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.427
O-OKAY, UH, WELL, I-I KNOW THAT,
UH, WE'RE ALL ANXIOUS

16:34.461 --> 16:37.464
TO GET TO THE TURKEY,
SO I'LL BE QUICK. UH, WOW.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.567
THERE IS SO MUCH, SO MUCH
I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS YEAR.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.801
LIKE THE TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.436
(whispers)
TESSA! WE SHOOK ON IT.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.372
WE KNOW ABOUT YOUR
SECRET PUERTO RICAN GIRLFRIEND!

16:45.405 --> 16:46.506
PLEASE TELL ME THIS
IS TRUE.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.808
WAIT. HAVE YOU BEEN
FOLLOWING ME?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.610
TESSA, YOU MADE ME
A PROMISE.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.645
YOU TOOK MY KID
INTO MANHATTAN?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.281
YOU LIED TO ME.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.282
YOU LIED TO ME?

16:55.315 --> 16:56.849
YOU LIED TO ME!
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO WORK.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.385
I-I WAS AT WORK.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.719
THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY
AS WORK.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.189
IT DOES IF YOU'RE DOING IT
RIGHT. (mouths word)
(Dalia smacks table)

17:02.222 --> 17:04.591
GOD, YOU GUYS SUCK
AT THANKSGIVING!

17:08.528 --> 17:10.230
(singsongy) OKAY.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.764
(normal voice)
WHO'S READY FOR TURKEY TIME?

17:11.798 --> 17:14.267
I AM, MOTHER.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.369
IS THIS THE DRESS
YOU WANTED ME TO WEAR?

17:16.403 --> 17:17.570
(cloth rustles)
AAH!

17:17.604 --> 17:19.172
(gasps) OH, DEAR. OHH.
WHOA.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.607
OHH!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.242
OH, WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.144
LISA RUINED THANKSGIVING
WITH HER NAKED BODY.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.078
LISA WASN'T LIKE THIS

17:25.112 --> 17:27.347
BEFORE THE GIRL
ACROSS THE STREET MOVED IN.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.681
SHE USED TO BE
A GOOD LITTLE GIRL.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.884
WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M NOT
A GOOD LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.019
I'M A GROWN WOMAN,

17:33.052 --> 17:35.888
SO I CERTAINLY DON'T NEED YOU
LAYING OUT CLOTHES FOR ME.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.490
NICE RACK.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.858
THANK YOU, MEREDITH.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.193
YOU'LL HAVE A NICE RACK,
TOO, ONE DAY.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.395
ALL THE SHAY WOMEN DO.
RIGHT, NANA?

17:42.429 --> 17:44.231
OH, GOOD LORD, LISA.
GO TO YOUR ROOM!

17:44.264 --> 17:47.267
I'M NOT GOING TO MY ROOM.
DON'T YOU SEE, MOTHER?

17:47.300 --> 17:50.470
YOU'RE NOT CALLING
THE SHOTS ANYMORE. I AM.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?!

17:51.771 --> 17:53.740
I DON'T KNOW!

17:53.773 --> 17:56.376
(door closes)
WELL... (sighs)

17:56.409 --> 17:57.777
LET'S EAT. (chuckles)

17:57.810 --> 18:00.780
**

18:00.813 --> 18:02.815
(woman) * EVERYBODY GET DOWN
LIKE THAT *

18:02.849 --> 18:04.317
* EVERYBODY GET DOWN LIKE THAT

18:04.351 --> 18:05.785
A LITTLE REBELLION
IS A VITAL PART

18:05.818 --> 18:08.221
OF BECOMING AN ADULT,

18:08.255 --> 18:11.158
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE POLICE GET INVOLVED.
(sirens wailing)

18:11.191 --> 18:13.560
* WE ARE YOUNG,
DON'T TELL US HOW *

18:13.593 --> 18:15.195
WHAT AM I DOING?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.297
* BREAK THE RULES,
LET'S TEAR IT DOWN *

18:17.330 --> 18:19.266
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

18:19.299 --> 18:20.800
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

18:20.833 --> 18:21.768
JEEZ!

18:21.801 --> 18:23.370
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

18:23.403 --> 18:25.205
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

18:25.238 --> 18:26.573
(handle rattling)

18:26.606 --> 18:28.775
(siren whoops)

18:28.808 --> 18:30.143
(all shouting at once)
KEEP TESTING ME, YAKULT!

18:30.177 --> 18:32.245
(Dallas) EVERYBODY!
EVERYBODY, STOP ALL THE YELLING.
KEEP TESTING ME!

18:32.279 --> 18:33.280
(barks)
YOU'RE UPSETTING THE DOG.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.515
NO! NO! GET OUT! GET OUT!
STEVEN, LET THE DOG OUT!

18:35.548 --> 18:37.384
ACTUALLY, DALLAS,
ALL THIS FIGHTING IS

18:37.417 --> 18:38.418
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.387
GOD, WE GET IT, JENNA!
YOU GO TO BROWN.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.821
THAT'S CORRECT. I GO TO BROWN.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.723
DON'T PATRONIZE
MY DAUGHTER.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.825
DON'T REPRIMAND MINE.
WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.660
SHE'S A PRODUCT
OF TERRIBLE PARENTING!

18:47.694 --> 18:49.929
(gasps) YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SCHEDULED A C-SECTION

18:49.962 --> 18:51.264
BEFORE JENNA WAS TERM!

18:51.298 --> 18:52.299
OHH.
HA.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.666
WE HAD
A NONREFUNDABLE CRUISE BOOKED.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.369
I WAS BORN PREMATURE SO YOU GUYS
COULD GO ON A CRUISE?

18:56.403 --> 18:58.938
SO--SO WE COULD ALL GO
ON A CRUISE AS A FAMILY.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.742
(shouting resumes)
HEY, SIT DOWN. IT'S NOT OVER.
THIS IS NOT OVER.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.244
I WAS UP FOR A JOB
REDESIGNING A BAR.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.346
THAT'S WHY I STARTED GOING
BACK TO THE CITY.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.614
HOW MANY TIMES?

19:07.647 --> 19:08.415
TESSA...

19:08.448 --> 19:09.716
HOW MANY TIMES?

19:09.749 --> 19:10.883
(sighs) I-I'VE BEEN OUT
WITH HER TWICE.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.885
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU BEEN
BACK TO THE CITY?

19:12.919 --> 19:14.987
OH. I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE FIVE, SIX TIMES.

19:15.021 --> 19:15.955
I THOUGHT...

19:15.988 --> 19:18.358
(chuckles) I THOUGHT
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ZOE.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.592
(nasal voice) ZOE.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.995
LOOK, I NEEDED TO--TO WORK ON
SOMETHING OTHER THAN SKYLIGHTS.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.664
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
RIGHT?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.433
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU FEEL
CREATIVELY UNFULFILLED?

19:26.466 --> 19:28.235
YES.
THAT YOU'RE HARD-PRESSED
TO FIND PEOPLE

19:28.268 --> 19:29.802
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH HERE, LET ALONE DATE?

19:29.836 --> 19:31.671
YEAH, GEORGE.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.507
THE RULES AREN'T THE SAME
FOR US, TESSA. I'M SORRY.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.009
OH, RIGHT. I GET IT.
I'M FORCED TO LIVE

19:37.043 --> 19:40.613
MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE IN SUBURBIA
WITH PIN-STRAIGHT HAIR,

19:40.647 --> 19:42.649
BUT SOMEHOW
YOU'VE BEEN PARDONED.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.716
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT

19:43.750 --> 19:45.518
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS
GIVEN YOU A SAY,

19:45.552 --> 19:47.654
BUT WE ARE NOT EQUALS.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.691
SOMETIMES KIDS HAVE TO DO THINGS
THEIR PARENTS DON'T.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.892
(slaps leg)

19:54.761 --> 19:56.463
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO ALWAYS LIKE ME.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.631
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.477
MAYBE IT WAS THE SPIRIT
OF THANKSGIVING,

20:10.510 --> 20:12.379
BUT SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE CAR RIDE HOME,

20:12.412 --> 20:13.480
I BECAME THE TURKEY,

20:13.513 --> 20:15.648
AND GEORGE BECAME
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.749
SO I LOOKED UP
THE DEFINITION

20:16.783 --> 20:20.052
OF "TRADITION"
IN THE DICTIONARY.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.522
TURNS OUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.023
IS THIS THE HIGHWAY?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.825
HOLY CRAP!
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU--

20:25.858 --> 20:26.993
LISA!

20:27.026 --> 20:28.528
(pants) OKAY, I'M HAVING
A HEART ATTACK HERE.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.929
I CAN'T FEEL MY HANDS,
AND MY FEET ARE TINGLING.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.898
UH--
(chuckles) I SEE YOU DECIDED
NOT TO WEAR THE DRESS

20:31.931 --> 20:33.366
OR ANYTHING ELSE,
APPARENTLY.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.702
WELL, BEING NUDE IS
SURPRISINGLY LIBERATING.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.469
LISA, QUICKLY.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.505
THERE'S A GYM BAG
ON THE FLOOR...

20:38.538 --> 20:40.039
HMM.
WITH SWEAT STUFF IN IT.
WOULD YOU PLEASE?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.742
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SURE THING, MR. ALTMAN.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.380
YOU WENT TO BARD?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.982
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.719
GEORGE WASN'T GOING TO
RELOCATE US BACK TO MANHATTAN,

20:52.752 --> 20:54.053
BUT THAT DIDN'T MEAN

20:54.086 --> 20:56.589
HE COULDN'T OCCASIONALLY
COMPROMISE...

20:56.623 --> 20:59.359
IF I MAKE COFFEE,
WILL YOU HAVE SOME?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.961
I'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.930
WHAT IF I MAKE DECAF?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.432
(sighs)

21:05.465 --> 21:07.800
SURE.

21:07.834 --> 21:12.104
AND SOMETIMES A SMALL GESTURE
GOES A LONG WAY.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.074
WELL, AT LEAST I MADE GOOD
ON THE MILK SHAKES.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.545
THIS BETTER BE
ONE DAMN GOOD BLACK-AND-WHITE.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.614
THERE'S A LONG, BLACK HAIR
IN MINE.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.351
OH, WELL, THAT--THAT'S
PROBABLY JUST MARTINO'S.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.385
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL BE FINE.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.953
OH, HE'S VERY HEALTHY.

21:26.986 --> 21:27.954
IT WON'T HURT YOU.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.856
MM-HMM. YOU SHOULD BE FINE.
