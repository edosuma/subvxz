00:47.248 --> 00:49.348
JERRY: ...and then
come back again.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.150
ABBY: Okay...
JERRY: Three times.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.118
Yeah. Oh, there he is.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.521
Hey. Hey, Chin, get
in on this, bud.

00:55.523 --> 00:59.224
No, I'm...
just gonna get a drink.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.294
This double fudge is totally
rocking my world, Jerry.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.679
Seriously, dude, get in on this.
ABBY: Mmm!

01:03.680 --> 01:05.063
Your taste buds
will thank you.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.165
I'm going back to bed.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.699
ABBY:
Oh, come on, Kelly.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.334
Just a couple spoonfuls.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.071
Yeah, Kelly, come on.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.242
All right.

Yo, dude, you
didn't carry that

02:29.316 --> 02:30.749
all the way up the
stairs, did you?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.317
You know there's a
dumbwaiter, right?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.553
No, I did not.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.388
Thank your uncle
for not mentioning that.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.656
Yeah.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.458
So, uh, what
happened here?

02:39.460 --> 02:41.827
Homicide. Somebody popped
the homeowner last night.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.629
Vanessa Diaz.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.497
Poor thing.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.332
Her and her daughter Sara
just moved here

02:47.334 --> 02:48.800
from Mexico,
a few months ago.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.670
Yeah, McGarrett and Uncle D
think the killer

02:51.672 --> 02:53.338
was waiting for her
when she got home.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.340
She fought him off,
he chased her up here.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.742
The house has a panic button.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.377
She activated it, HPD got here

02:58.379 --> 03:00.312
in under four, but even then,
it was too late.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.513
Dropped a net
over the whole area,

03:01.515 --> 03:02.948
but still somehow,
this guy slipped away.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.950
What about the little girl?

03:04.952 --> 03:09.888
She was at a, uh, sleepover
at a neighbor's house, luckily.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.557
All right,
I gotta bounce.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.325
This house has
video cameras everywhere,

03:13.327 --> 03:15.594
but there doesn't appear to be
an FTP server on the premises,

03:15.596 --> 03:17.729
so the footage must back up
to one off-site.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.897
Anyway, I gotta go find it.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.265
Hopefully, the cameras
caught something.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.300
Tag out.

03:22.903 --> 03:23.635

03:23.637 --> 03:25.704

05:26.593 --> 05:28.327
All right, thank you very much.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.996
All right, Hirsch got
a little bump on the head.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.998
He's gonna be okay.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.533
As soon as they let him
out of the ER,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.034
we'll sit him down
with a sketch artist.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.869
What are we thinking, buddy?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.871
Okay, we are thinking

05:39.873 --> 05:43.709
that, uh, our killer heard
the sirens last night,

05:43.711 --> 05:46.578
uh, figured he didn't have time
to get out of here,

05:46.580 --> 05:49.481
so he dips into this room.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.883
Uh, he's thinking
that he can lay low

05:51.885 --> 05:54.920
until everybody clears
out, uh, make an escape,

05:54.922 --> 05:57.723
but lucky for us,
he runs into Hirsch.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.558
And lucky for Hirsch,
he didn't put a bullet in him

05:59.560 --> 06:00.693
like he did the victim.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.827
Right, I'm thinking
that he figured

06:01.829 --> 06:03.628
HPD was still in
the neighborhood,

06:03.630 --> 06:05.530
didn't want to risk
somebody hearing a gunshot.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.765
All right,
got a live feed of every

06:06.767 --> 06:07.899
security camera in the house

06:07.901 --> 06:09.401
and a dedicated server,

06:09.403 --> 06:10.502
which means
the footage wasn't uploaded

06:10.504 --> 06:12.070
to an off-site location,
like I thought.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.273
The backup was done here.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.475
And unfortunately, the entire
server's been wiped clean.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.510
So no footage?
No.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.511
Well, what about
physical evidence?

06:19.513 --> 06:21.513
There's gotta be something.
No.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.015
Thanks.
ERIC: You got it.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.516
STEVE: Help me out with something.
Uh-huh.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.852
There was 15 cops in this
room earlier, right?

06:26.854 --> 06:28.453
Including you and me.
Mm-hmm.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.522
Never once did any of us guess
that there was a safe room.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.857
Right. So how did
the killer know?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.792
Exactly.
Right, so either

06:33.794 --> 06:36.495
Vanessa was on her way
in here when she got clipped,

06:36.497 --> 06:39.965
or the killer had some inside
information about this house.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.666
I think it'd be helpful
to speak to the daughter.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.034
Where are we at
with next of kin?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.836
HPD's working on it,

06:44.837 --> 06:46.637
but, uh, Vanessa's got no
relatives on the Island,

06:46.640 --> 06:49.674
and as far as we know, Sara's
father is not in the picture,

06:49.676 --> 06:51.143
so it's gonna
take a little time.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.512
Well, where's the kid?
She's next door,

06:53.514 --> 06:55.013
at the neighbor's house,
where she stayed last night.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.915
Um, HPD's gonna pick her up

06:56.917 --> 06:59.651
when Social Services
assigns a caseworker.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.653
Anybody told her
about her mom yet?

07:01.655 --> 07:03.054
No, not yet.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.056
Speaking of people
who need looking after,

07:05.058 --> 07:07.058
the killer saw Hirsch's face,

07:07.060 --> 07:09.561
so until we catch this guy,
he's gonna need some protection.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.631
Yeah, who's, uh, who's
gonna be in charge of that?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.737
Officer Kalakaua.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.739
When they told me
I was getting protection,

07:20.741 --> 07:22.441
I was hoping you'd volunteer.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.575
I didn't.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.943
You can thank
McGarrett for this.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.945
I'll be sure to do that.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.947
Question: If it
comes down to it,

07:28.949 --> 07:30.916
would you be willing
to take a bullet for me?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.617
No.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.619
But I might have to shoot myself
to get out of this assignment.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.456
Hey, you ready to go?

07:37.458 --> 07:39.090
After you, my dear.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.092
You first.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.761
If you say so.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.130
But, uh, no leering
at the caboose.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.799
You're supposed to be on
the lookout for threats.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.568
Unless, of course,
you want to.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.971
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

♪ ♪

08:02.516 --> 08:04.516
I know, it's a dump.

a six-bed in Kailua.

08:15.762 --> 08:19.698
And then I met you,
and it all went away.

So what's your poison?

08:22.035 --> 08:25.237
Espresso? Cappuccino?
Macchiato?

08:25.239 --> 08:26.104
Just water.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.944
Really, Hirsch?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.613
Uh, where are you going?

08:34.615 --> 08:35.947
Uh, I have to
check the bedroom.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.750
Wait, is that
absolutely necessary?

08:38.752 --> 08:40.652
Because...

08:41.889 --> 08:43.555
Oh, my God.

08:43.557 --> 08:47.893
Uh, I swear, that was
here when I moved in.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.227
All right, that's a lie.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.896
But for the record,
I painted that

08:50.898 --> 08:54.900
long before you were ever
engaged to what's-his-name,

08:54.902 --> 08:57.569
back-back when I thought you
and I still had a future.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.038
Still... creepy.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.310
(cell phone chimes) You
actually should be flattered.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.647
Out of all the women
I could have chosen as my muse,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.148
I chose you.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.150
I'm honored. Deeply.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.019
The sketch artist is on her way.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.221
A sketch artist? What for?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.889
So you can give a description.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.558
Of the murder suspect.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.293
The same one that put you
in the emergency room.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.295
My dear, save your money.

09:23.297 --> 09:24.996
I can do the sketch.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.998
Thanks. We'll leave it
to the pros.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.035
I guarantee you
I'll do a better job.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.570
Hirsch, a composite sketch

09:31.572 --> 09:32.904
is not like one
of your caricatures.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.340
It's an important
forensic tool.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.342
We need to have the most
accurate description possible.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.877
And the sketch artist has ways

09:38.879 --> 09:41.580
of helping people remember
exactly who they saw.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.048
Honey, that painting
of you in there,

09:43.050 --> 09:45.050
and all the other ones
I keep in my clo...

09:46.853 --> 09:48.186
...done from memory.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.055
Trust me, I got this.

09:50.057 --> 09:53.058
There are other paintings?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.126
There better not be nudes.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.597
STEVE:
I mean, I got to admit,

09:58.599 --> 10:00.599
this actually looks like
the work of a pro.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.734
Except for the part
where he signed it.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.603
"To my Five-O-hana.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.870
All the best, Hirsch."

10:05.872 --> 10:07.205
What a putz.
(all laughing)

10:07.207 --> 10:09.608
Anyway, we ran this composite
through facial rec.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.742
We struck out there.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.010
But there was
some good news.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.013
Eric managed to pull
some of the suspect's DNA

10:15.015 --> 10:16.648
off Hirsch's clothing.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.650
And while the guy
isn't in the system,

10:18.652 --> 10:21.119
we did get a hit on the same DNA

10:21.121 --> 10:23.288
on a couple
of unsolved burglaries.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.691
Now, both these houses are on
the North Shore, upscale homes,

10:26.693 --> 10:28.193
and both of 'em hit
within the last six weeks.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.228
All right, so our
suspect's a thief, right?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.364
Uh, I'm guessing this-this was
a burglary turned violent.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.666
CHIN: Yeah, and we may
have a lead already.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.834
It turns out
that our vic's house

10:35.836 --> 10:37.669
and the two houses
on the North Shore

10:37.671 --> 10:38.803
have something in common.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.372
They were all
on the market recently.

10:40.374 --> 10:43.041
We think our prowler has
a very specific MO.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.379
He recons his targets by
posing as a potential buyer.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.031
That's smart, right?

10:49.032 --> 10:50.682
Go to... go to all the open
houses, case the joint up close,

10:50.684 --> 10:52.784
check out all
the security stuff.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.885
That's how he knew
about Vanessa's safe room.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.221
All right, good,
let's get Hirsch's sketch

10:56.223 --> 10:57.889
to whoever held the listings
for these houses,

11:23.150 --> 11:26.785
Oh, it's, uh, bronzed sea bass

11:28.789 --> 11:32.023
lovely Chilean Chardonnay.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.928
Huh.
I won't tell if you won't.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.851
I have an urgent

12:32.853 --> 12:34.486
This is not a date, and we're
not leaving the apartment.

12:34.488 --> 12:37.756
I am. That was the retirement
home where my father lives.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.390
Apparently,
there's some issue.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.360
If I don't fix it today,
they're gonna throw him out.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.762
Okay.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.096
Fine.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.533
MAX:
<i> Gentlemen, uh,</i>

12:48.535 --> 12:51.369
as the English statesman
and poet George Villiers

12:51.371 --> 12:53.037
once famously wrote,

12:53.039 --> 12:55.907
"Ay now the plot thickens
very much upon us."

12:57.310 --> 12:58.543
Oh, yeah?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.779
Okay. What'd you find out?

13:00.781 --> 13:02.914
Well, during my autopsy,
I found some fresh DNA

13:02.916 --> 13:04.916
underneath
the victim's fingernails.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.885
It appears that Ms. Diaz
scratched her killer

13:06.887 --> 13:08.253
during their struggle.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.555
That's not an
unusual thing, Max.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.391
That is correct, Commander.
However, that DNA was different

13:13.393 --> 13:15.960
from the sample that
Detective Williams' nephew found

13:15.962 --> 13:17.462
on Mr. Hirsch's clothing.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.798
Okay, so what,
there's, uh, two thieves?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.299
Or two crimes.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.569
Please note,
in addition to the bruises

13:24.571 --> 13:26.838
that she suffered
at the hands of her killer,

13:26.840 --> 13:29.908
she also sustained injuries
that were consistent with CPR.

13:29.910 --> 13:33.144
And furthermore, the DNA that was
found on Mr. Hirsch's clothing

13:33.146 --> 13:35.380
was also found
on your victim's lips.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.081
Our thief tried to save her?

13:37.083 --> 13:39.317
That is correct.
So that also

13:39.319 --> 13:41.419
probably means
he didn't try to kill her.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.121
STEVE:
Maybe he's on a job

13:43.123 --> 13:45.957
at the time that the killer and
Vanessa came back to the house.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.926
Right? He doesn't want
to get involved,

13:47.928 --> 13:49.260
so he hides in the safe room.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.929
He comes out when he
tries to help,

13:50.931 --> 13:53.097
and then, uh, then he goes
back in when HPD shows up.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.465
DANNY:
Well, if that's the case,

13:54.467 --> 13:58.336
our burglar probably saw
her murder on the monitor,

13:58.338 --> 14:01.372
which means that
we have an eyewitness.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.574
An eyewitness
who will do anything he can

14:02.576 --> 14:03.842
not to get found.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.586
GROVER:
<i> Well, now that Max's autopsy</i>

14:14.587 --> 14:16.087
has revealed no
sexual assault,

14:16.089 --> 14:17.622
I've been digging around
in Vanessa's background

14:17.624 --> 14:20.992
to see if I can figure out why
somebody would want her dead.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.328
We got any ideas?
Unfortunately, no.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.330
The people who are
looking after little Sara

14:25.332 --> 14:27.332
say that Vanessa
was good people.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.334
She had strong ties
to the community,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.402
and she was active in her
little girl's school.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.404
(sighs) What's
her occupation?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.874
Well, she told her neighbors
she was into finance.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.444
Said her expertise was in
emerging Latin American markets

14:39.446 --> 14:41.363
or some such thing.

14:41.364 --> 14:43.281
She hadn't managed to find a
job on the Island anywhere yet,

14:43.283 --> 14:45.316
but she said she
was interviewing.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.918
I also spoke

14:46.920 --> 14:48.236
with the Mexican government--
I figured

14:48.237 --> 14:49.553
maybe there was something
she was into over there

14:49.556 --> 14:51.155
that followed her over here,
but they said

14:51.157 --> 14:52.257
they didn't know anything
about that.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.460
But... here's what
they do have on her.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.329
Vanessa was born in La Tuna,

14:58.331 --> 15:00.565
which is a small town
in Sinaloa.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.667
Both her parents were farmers.
They're deceased now.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.435
But she may have had a cousin.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.137
The Mexican government's

15:06.139 --> 15:08.373
(phone rings)
looking into that.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.443
Chin, what do you got?
One of the Realtors we spoke to

15:12.445 --> 15:14.012
recognized our thief.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.247
She says the guy's
name is Doug Morrow.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.448
They met at an open
house recently.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.449
Now, apparently,

15:18.451 --> 15:19.517
Morrow told her he that was

15:19.519 --> 15:20.551
from the mainland,

15:20.553 --> 15:21.653
but he never said from where.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.138
The Realtor also said

15:23.139 --> 15:24.622
that Morrow was interested
in a pocket listing

15:24.624 --> 15:26.024
she has coming up.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.425
He left a cell phone number
to contact him at

15:27.427 --> 15:28.993
when the place
was ready to be shown.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.296
I'm texting you
the number right now.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.397
(computer dings)

15:35.969 --> 15:36.968
Got him.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.469
Windward side of the Island.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.938
All right, me and Danny
will go pick him up.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.040
Thanks, Chin.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.141
(instrumental Hawaiian music
playing over P.A. system)

15:53.553 --> 15:55.386
Forget it, Benny.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.121
She's married.
I already asked.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.257
(phone chimes)

16:02.963 --> 16:05.029
Excuse me.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.465

16:09.636 --> 16:11.602
Excuse me, Hirsch?

16:11.604 --> 16:14.138
Yes, uh, what is it?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.606
Good news.
We got the guy.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.276
Oh, that--
Superb, great.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.544
So I'm gonna be...
Yeah.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.745
You should get going now.

16:20.747 --> 16:21.746
Gerard, who is it?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.014
Uh, no one.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.082
Just a friend.
She's leaving.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.316
Well, tell her
to come in.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.986
Uh, she's-she's
in a rush, Pop.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.388
A rush? Everyone's
always in a rush.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.589
I want to meet her.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.224
Uh, may-maybe another time!

16:33.226 --> 16:35.259
Another time?
I could be dead tomorrow.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.461
Dad!

16:36.463 --> 16:38.029
Look, it's fine.

16:38.031 --> 16:38.663
Hi.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.432
I'm Kono.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.167

16:43.169 --> 16:44.335
Uh, how do you do?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.570
Leo Hirsch.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.372
It's good to meet you,
Mr. Hirsch.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.474
Oh.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.742
You're with them.

16:50.744 --> 16:53.444
Uh, you're Five-O.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.580
Gerard's told me all about you.

16:55.582 --> 16:59.050
Sounds like my boy's
been helping the team.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.519
Well, yes, he has.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.553
Actually, because of him,
we have a good shot

17:02.555 --> 17:04.422
of clearing the case
we're working.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.424
Just like the
other times, right?

17:06.426 --> 17:08.059
HIRSCH:
Uh...

17:08.061 --> 17:09.727
we-we don't need
to talk about that.

17:09.729 --> 17:13.031
Gerard's told me about
what he did for you.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.532
Taking time off
from the gallery

17:14.534 --> 17:17.602
to help you catch
a couple of people?

17:17.604 --> 17:21.239
Even volunteering to put himself
in danger a couple of times.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.707
I'm so proud of him.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.708
He's a good boy.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.709
Yes.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.711
He's, uh, he's special.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.313
I wish there was more
like him in the world.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.083
Well, um,

17:32.085 --> 17:34.118
Officer Kalakaua
really has to get going.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.587
And-and come to think of it,
she's my ride, so,

17:36.589 --> 17:38.523
I have to go, too.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.458
I'm gonna come see you
in a few days, Dad.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.293
I put it down in your calendar.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.127
And I'll bring some new paint
and brushes with me.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.229
Okay?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.264
(kisses)

17:46.266 --> 17:48.867
Oh, and promise

17:48.868 --> 17:51.469
you won't give your nurses any
trouble about taking your meds.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.405
I'll try not to.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.075
Bye.
Good meeting you.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.543
(door closes)

17:58.545 --> 18:00.778
So, I take it
he doesn't know about...

18:00.780 --> 18:03.714
About my former life
as a criminal?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.616
No.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.119
Thanks for playing along.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.788
I appreciate
your discretion.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.695
I was in the master bedroom

18:17.697 --> 18:19.630
when I heard the
front door unlock.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.500
So I go check the cameras.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.442
<i> The guy sat her down.</i>

18:31.444 --> 18:33.111
<i> Started going</i>
<i> through her phone.</i>

18:33.113 --> 18:35.580
<i> Then he started</i>
<i> questioning her.</i>

18:35.582 --> 18:36.747
<i> About what, I have no idea,</i>

18:36.749 --> 18:38.666
<i> since there was no audio.</i>

18:38.667 --> 18:40.584
<i> I don't think she was giving</i>
<i> him any answers, 'cause</i>

18:40.587 --> 18:42.520
the guy was
getting pissed.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.889
He had to hit her
a few more times

18:44.891 --> 18:46.557
before she started talking.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.127
Okay, what happened next?

18:49.129 --> 18:50.862
MORROW: <i> The guy made the mistake</i>
<i> of turning his back on her.</i>

18:50.864 --> 18:53.231
<i> After she got free,</i>

18:53.233 --> 18:55.166
<i> she ran for the bedroom.</i>

18:55.168 --> 18:57.802
<i> And when I realized</i>
<i> where she was going, I...</i>

18:57.804 --> 19:00.471
<i> I locked myself</i>
<i> inside the safe room.</i>

19:00.473 --> 19:03.141
<i> She hit the panic button,</i>

19:03.143 --> 19:04.909
<i> grabbed a gun</i>
<i> out of the dresser.</i>

19:04.911 --> 19:07.061
<i> She wasn't fast enough.</i>

19:07.062 --> 19:09.212
<i>Guy came in and shot her before</i>
<i> she could pull the trigger.</i>

19:09.215 --> 19:12.316
<i> After that, he picked up</i>
<i> the gun and took off.</i>

19:12.318 --> 19:13.885
I waited till he was gone,
then I came out.

19:17.624 --> 19:21.325
(sirens approaching)

19:21.327 --> 19:22.693
<i> I tried to help her,</i>
<i> but it was too late.</i>

19:22.695 --> 19:25.296
<i> Then I heard the cops coming.</i>

19:25.298 --> 19:26.998
(sirens getting closer)

19:26.999 --> 19:28.699
<i> I was afraid if they found me,</i>
<i> they'd think I did it.</i>

19:28.701 --> 19:30.268
You got to believe me.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.470
There's nothing more
I could've done.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.842
So, Morrow took these pictures
off the monitors

19:37.844 --> 19:39.694
in the safe room?

19:39.695 --> 19:41.545
Yeah, he wanted evidence
to back up his story.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.481
The resolution's
obviously not very good.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.950
Well, good enough,
though.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.585
Here's our murderer:

19:47.587 --> 19:50.388
Jimmy Brigante,
36 years old.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.457
Convictions for assault
and weapons possession.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.327
Yeah, but nothing here seems
to connect him with our vic.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.361
Wait, wait, wait.
Look at that.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.396
Known associates.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.864
This guy's
suspected of being

19:59.866 --> 20:02.400
one of Michelle Shioma's
top soldiers.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.302
So how does a single mother
living in Kahala

20:04.304 --> 20:06.437
get herself mixed up
with a Yakuza boss?

20:06.439 --> 20:08.372
Maybe Vanessa Diaz
was more

20:08.374 --> 20:09.574
than a single mother
from Kahala.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.875
Huh.
Let's think about it.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.677
She's got no job.
She's got no spouse.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.978
She's got no money coming in,

20:13.980 --> 20:15.546
yet she lives
in a 5,000-square-foot house

20:15.548 --> 20:18.349
in one of the Island's
most expensive zip codes.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.284
It doesn't sound
like a regular

20:20.286 --> 20:21.819
citizen to me, all right?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.254
And-and let's not forget

20:23.256 --> 20:24.555
the town she's from,
it's in Sinaloa.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.290
Right, the narco
capital of the world.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.392
So what, you think
she's part of a drug cartel?

20:28.394 --> 20:30.595
Well, I don't know,
but I mean,

20:30.596 --> 20:32.797
the background in finance,
i-it could be a cover.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.433
Something to explain
why she has money.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.435
Well, if you're right,
then Vanessa's murder

20:37.437 --> 20:39.437
just might be another one
of Shioma's power moves,

20:39.439 --> 20:41.472
like she did with Adam.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.807
All right,
let's contact the DEA.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.542
See if they got
anything on Vanessa.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.278
And let's get
an alert out on Brigante.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.355
Um, thanks again...

20:57.357 --> 20:59.490
for before.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.858
Oh, you know,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.893
your dad seems
really sweet.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.496
Seems like you have
a good relationship.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.699
That wasn't always the case.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.701
When-when I was growing up,

21:10.703 --> 21:13.371
I was closer to my mom.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.372
Hmm.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.640
After she died,

21:15.642 --> 21:18.476
uh, my dad and I
drifted apart.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.478
It's really just been
the past few years

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
that we've
patched things up.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.583
Well, he's lucky to have
you looking after him.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.520
Tell you the truth,

21:29.522 --> 21:31.722
it-it hasn't been easy.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.358
His, uh, health
is failing.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.595
Not sure how much time
he has left.

21:37.597 --> 21:40.464
It's been, uh...

21:40.466 --> 21:43.501
difficult to watch.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.304
I know what you
mean, actually,

21:46.306 --> 21:49.473
'cause my mom suffered a brain
aneurysm a few years ago.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.443
And she can't speak.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.545
She needs constant care.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.814
It's been rough on everyone.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.915
Yeah.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.017
I'm sorry.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.523
Well, I should let you get
back to actual police work.

22:07.393 --> 22:11.462
You know, you're a good egg,
Officer Kalakaua.

22:11.464 --> 22:15.866
That Adam is a lucky man.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.909
(phone rings)

22:31.884 --> 22:33.584
JERRY:
<i> McGarrett asked me to see</i>

22:33.586 --> 22:35.519
if I could verify
Vanessa's finance background,

22:35.521 --> 22:38.122
so I checked with all the
brokerage houses on the Island,

22:38.124 --> 22:40.458
and none of them have ever
interviewed a Vanessa Diaz

22:40.460 --> 22:43.794
who specializes in emerging
markets in Latin America.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.030
Well, Steve was right.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.499
Yeah. Job was a cover story.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.368
Good work.

22:54.407 --> 22:57.408
Jer, I was thinking...

22:57.410 --> 22:59.110
You have a stable job
here now, right?

22:59.112 --> 23:01.479
Yeah, I mean, still no badge, but...
(chuckles) Right.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.914
But, uh, you're employed,
got some money in the bank.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.583
I got a little green.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.917
Actually, most of it's gold now.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.452
Started converting it last year.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.720
Think we're going
back to the gold standard.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.623
Right, right,
I remember you telling me.

23:12.625 --> 23:16.093
Well, seeing as you have
a job and some money,

23:16.095 --> 23:19.096
I'm wondering if
it might be time to...

23:19.098 --> 23:20.798
get your own place.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.468
You want me to move out?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.606
Is this 'cause I don't pay rent?

23:28.608 --> 23:29.740
Because I pitch in
in other ways.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.776
I mean, cooking,
cleaning, laundry.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.779
No, no, uh,
it's not about the rent.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.113
Is it me?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.515
Am I doing something?

23:37.517 --> 23:41.986
No... No, this is...
actually more about me.

23:41.988 --> 23:42.987
I see.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.623
It's not me, it's you.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.124
(sighs)

23:47.126 --> 23:49.493
Or is this about her?

23:49.495 --> 23:51.662
Well...

23:51.664 --> 23:53.531
Look, I'm not an idiot, okay?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.533
I can see with Abby
in the picture

23:55.535 --> 23:57.835
how I might be
cramping your style.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.439
I mean, (sighs) a little...?

24:01.441 --> 24:02.907
Sure.

24:02.909 --> 24:06.010
You want your alone time.
I got that.

24:06.012 --> 24:09.947
But, you know, for the record,
any time I hear any noises,

24:09.949 --> 24:12.216
I slap on some headphones.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.685
You know, unlike the NSA,
I respect your privacy.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.555
I appreciate that.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.790
Uh, but s-still.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.892
You want me gone.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.561
(sighs)

24:23.563 --> 24:25.896
Look, we don't have
to decide anything right now.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.698
I just wanted
to start the discussion.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.200
No, no, no, no... I get it.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.101
(phone rings)

24:33.039 --> 24:35.105
Lieutenant Kelly.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.676
I'm sorry?

24:38.678 --> 24:39.810
<i> (elevator bell dings)</i>

24:39.812 --> 24:42.813
When the officers
came to pick her up,

24:42.815 --> 24:45.816
Sara told them that she had an
uncle in the police department.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.151
Said his name was Chin.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.152
Okay.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.153
Is that all she said?

24:49.155 --> 24:50.221
Yeah.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.157
And no one's told her
about her mom yet, right?

24:53.159 --> 24:56.160
No. Social Services wants
to give us more time

24:56.162 --> 24:58.762
to... track down
the next of kin.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.502
All right.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.036
Let me have a few
minutes with her, okay?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.212
Hi, Sara.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.721
My name's
Lieutenant Kelly.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.623
Hi.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.858
Hi.

25:30.229 --> 25:33.230
Is it okay if we talk
for a few minutes?

25:33.232 --> 25:34.965
Okay.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.002
What's her name?

25:38.004 --> 25:39.537
Newton.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.871
He's a boy.
Oh.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.207
Of course he's a boy.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.209
How did I not know that?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.678
He's very handsome.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.548
And you have a rabbit
bracelet, too.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.550
You must really like rabbits.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.051
My mommy gave it to me.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.053
She said I should
never take it off.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.721
Hmm.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.790
That's a good idea.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.660
You just moved
here, right?

26:02.662 --> 26:07.131
Do you know about a place
called Manana Island?

26:07.133 --> 26:08.799
We also call it Rabbit Island.

26:08.801 --> 26:09.967
Do you know why?

26:09.969 --> 26:11.769
(chuckles)

26:11.771 --> 26:13.771
Because there used
to be wild rabbits

26:13.773 --> 26:15.973
that used to run
all over the place.

26:15.975 --> 26:20.311
And if you look really closely,

26:20.313 --> 26:24.782
you can see that the island
even looks like a rabbit head.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.116
(laughs)
That's weird.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.953
Yes, that's so weird.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.020
Hey.

26:33.993 --> 26:37.661
Sara, can I ask
you a question?

26:37.663 --> 26:40.364
The nice officer told me

26:40.366 --> 26:42.299
that you said that
you had an uncle

26:42.301 --> 26:43.834
in the police department.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.035
Is that right?

26:49.709 --> 26:51.041
How do you know that?

26:51.043 --> 26:54.712
'Cause that's
what my mommy told me.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.715
Okay.

26:57.717 --> 27:01.819
Did your mommy say anything
else about this uncle?

27:01.821 --> 27:04.822
Uh-huh. She said
he was married to my aunt.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.690
And I was named after her.

27:06.692 --> 27:11.228
Okay, so your aunt
is named Sara, too?

27:11.230 --> 27:13.897
No, my middle name
is my aunt's name.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.200
(gasps)
Oh.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.868
What's your middle name?

27:17.870 --> 27:20.070
Malia.

27:24.710 --> 27:28.045
Sara,

27:28.047 --> 27:30.714
your father,

27:30.716 --> 27:33.784
is his name Gabriel?

27:36.756 --> 27:39.156
Do you know my daddy?

27:53.773 --> 27:56.440
STEVE:
<i> Gabriel must have met Vanessa</i>

27:56.442 --> 27:57.742
when he was
living in Mexico.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.043
He probably kept
her and Sara a secret

27:59.045 --> 28:01.045
because he knew they'd
be targets for his enemies.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.980
Yeah, well, Shioma must
have found out somehow.

28:02.982 --> 28:06.050
That's why she sent Brigante
to question Vanessa.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.918
She figures if anybody knows
where Gabriel is, it's her.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.354
Okay, I guess the question is:
what did Brigante find out?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.322
What's gonna happen
with Sara now?

28:12.324 --> 28:15.325
Well, for the time being, HPD's
gonna take her to a safe house.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.027
I'd like to be there with her.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.896
Of course.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.330
All right, we, uh, we should
go talk to Michelle Shioma.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.966
Yeah, we should do that now.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.072
Thanks for coming back.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.740
KONO: Yeah, you said,
uh, it was urgent.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.709
I got a little concerned.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.777
But you didn't say anything
to Gerard, right?

28:33.779 --> 28:34.945
No.
Good.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.914
Good.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.649
Malasada?

28:38.650 --> 28:40.383
They're a little stale
but still pretty good.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.052
No, thanks.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.054
Mr. Hirsch, is
everything all right?

28:44.056 --> 28:46.390
No, ev-everything is fine.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.059
I just wanted to talk
to you about my son.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.961
Just the two of us.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.396
Okay.

28:52.398 --> 28:57.000
Look, I know the truth.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.069
I know
what he's done.

28:59.071 --> 29:03.941
The stolen paintings,
the forgeries, prison.

29:03.943 --> 29:07.344
He tries, but he can't fool me.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.012
I don't understand.

29:09.014 --> 29:12.883
If you know about everything,
why do you pretend not to?

29:12.885 --> 29:15.886
Because it's important to Gerard

29:15.888 --> 29:18.188
to believe that
I'm proud of him.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.425
I-I-I don't know where
I went wrong with him.

29:21.427 --> 29:25.062
Believe me, I didn't
set out to raise a crook.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.063
I'm sure you did your best.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.782
For what it's worth,

29:27.783 --> 29:29.500
he seems to have really
turned his life around.

29:29.502 --> 29:32.169
Yes, that's true.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.805
But I know it isn't
easy for him.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.107
My son has
a real affection

29:37.109 --> 29:40.210
for the finer things,

29:40.212 --> 29:42.212
and I know
he misses that stuff.

29:42.214 --> 29:45.149
Look, I know we don't
know each other,

29:45.151 --> 29:48.152
but I need to ask a favor.

29:48.154 --> 29:51.155
Will you keep an eye
on him for me?

29:51.157 --> 29:54.558
Help him to stay
on the straight and narrow?

29:54.560 --> 29:57.060
Of course.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.129
Thank you.

30:03.836 --> 30:07.838
MICHELLE:
Vanessa Diaz?

30:07.840 --> 30:11.575
I'm sorry, but I don't know
anyone by that name.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.243
Okay, what about
Jimmy Brigante?

30:13.245 --> 30:15.078
You know him?

30:15.080 --> 30:18.081
That sounds familiar.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.084
Uh, think he may have been one
of my daughter's tennis coaches.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.820
Or, uh, was it swimming?

30:25.391 --> 30:28.926
All right,
Vanessa Diaz's full name

30:28.928 --> 30:31.228
is Vanessa Diaz Waincroft.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.430
She was Gabriel's wife,
she was shot dead

30:33.432 --> 30:34.598
in her home last night,

30:34.600 --> 30:37.134
and Jimmy Brigante
pulled the trigger.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.268
Now, you already know all this

30:38.270 --> 30:40.270
because Jimmy Brigante
works for you,

30:40.272 --> 30:42.506
and you're the one who sent him
over there to get information.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.175
At the moment,
Brigante's in the wind,

30:45.177 --> 30:46.310
but we are gonna
catch up with him,

30:46.312 --> 30:49.046
and when we do,
he's gonna roll on you.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.048
Look, here's the thing.
You-you got kids, right?

30:51.049 --> 30:53.049
You got-- your daughters are,
what, eight and ten years old?

30:53.052 --> 30:55.185
The way things look
right now,

30:55.187 --> 30:57.120
you're probably gonna
go away and not get out

30:57.122 --> 30:59.523
until the young one's
about 30 years old, right?

30:59.525 --> 31:01.525
But if you help us,

31:01.527 --> 31:03.527
maybe we can guarantee
that you get to see,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.195
uh, the young one's
high school graduation.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.065
Look, all we want to know is
what Brigante was able to learn

31:08.067 --> 31:09.867
about Gabriel's whereabouts.
That's it.

31:09.869 --> 31:13.170
Gentlemen, if I knew where
to find Gabriel Waincroft,

31:13.172 --> 31:14.504
I would tell you.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.241
The man killed
my father.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.943
I want to see him punished as much
as you do. DANNY: I-I believe that.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.279
But I think that you'd rather
see him dead than in prison.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.883
I'm sorry,
I just can't help you.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.468
Okay.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.052
Well, we'll just have to see
what Brigante's got to say

31:29.054 --> 31:30.087
when we catch up with him.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.221
(chuckles)

31:31.223 --> 31:33.557
Why is that, uh,
why is that funny?

31:33.559 --> 31:37.561
It's just that you guys
seem pretty confident

31:37.563 --> 31:39.563
despite your
track record.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.198
I'm sorry, "track record"?

31:41.200 --> 31:45.068
Oh, meaning Five-O hasn't
had a whole lot of success

31:45.070 --> 31:48.138
getting people
to open up about me.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.008
You talking about the prison
guard from Halawa?

31:51.010 --> 31:54.278
That guy was...
he was terrified of you.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.481
But Jimmy Brigante,
he's a tough kid.

31:57.483 --> 32:01.018
I mean, I guarantee you, he's
gonna give you up in a second

32:01.020 --> 32:03.153
if it means less
prison time for him.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.956
(door buzzes)

32:14.667 --> 32:17.200
Her lawyer's
upstairs.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.335
How you doing
in there anyway?

32:18.337 --> 32:19.670
Really good,
really good.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.338
She's, uh, she's about
to break any second.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.339
GROVER:
Mmm.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.674
Got a lead on Brigante?

32:23.676 --> 32:25.676
Not a thing.

32:25.678 --> 32:27.678
All right, Steve, we got to...
we got to let her go.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.280
We got nothing
to hold her on. No?

32:31.717 --> 32:34.384
(door buzzes)

32:34.386 --> 32:36.386
I can't believe it.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.689
CHIN:
Yeah, well, you and me both.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.357
Do you think Malia knew
about Vanessa?

32:40.359 --> 32:42.526
CHIN:
<i> It's possible.</i>

32:42.528 --> 32:44.528
I know she was in touch with
Gabriel when he was in Mexico.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.430
Okay, so what's she like? Sara?

32:46.432 --> 32:48.432
She's a sweet kid.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.301
The fact is,
she's Gabriel's blood.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.637
Having a hard time wrapping
my head around that.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.073
Yeah, well, she's
Malia's blood, too.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.209
Yeah.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.144
Listen, I should go.

33:01.146 --> 33:04.281
Okay, I-I'll talk
to you later.

33:13.258 --> 33:15.258
(tires screeching)

33:30.275 --> 33:33.176
(Sara screaming)

33:34.313 --> 33:36.313
No! No! No!

33:38.217 --> 33:39.216
(grunts)

33:39.218 --> 33:41.251
Stop! No!

33:41.253 --> 33:43.320
(grunts)

33:45.491 --> 33:47.357
(tires screeching)

34:03.809 --> 34:07.044
Abby, find Sara.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.546
The bracelet.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.581
Her bracelet.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.816
What? What bracelet?
I don't understand.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.384
Bracelet.
Sorry, we need to go.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.452
Now.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.192
KONO:
Steve!

34:22.194 --> 34:23.360
He's okay.
Listen to me.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.362
He's gonna be all right.

34:25.363 --> 34:27.363
Two shots, through and
through, no vitals, okay?

34:27.366 --> 34:29.566
He's gonna be
okay, all right?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.535
All right,
MAILE AMBER Alert is out.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.537
HPD is pulling traffic footage.

34:33.539 --> 34:34.838
STEVE: All right, what
about the dead guy?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.406
We get an I.D.?

34:36.408 --> 34:37.774
Yeah, his name's Raymond Murata.

34:37.776 --> 34:41.244
And, uh, he's got, uh,
ties to the Yakuza.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.587
This has Shioma
written all over it.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.090
Okay, what is
her endgame anyway?

34:53.092 --> 34:54.558
I mean, this isn't
a ransom play.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.293
Is she really thinking

34:56.295 --> 34:58.095
of killing Gabriel's
daughter out of revenge?

34:58.097 --> 34:59.362
GROVER:
I think that might be

34:59.364 --> 35:00.981
over the line, even for her.

35:00.982 --> 35:02.599
If that was the plan, they
would've done it right here.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.767
It's got to be about leverage.

35:03.769 --> 35:04.801
It's leverage.

35:04.803 --> 35:05.986
What do you mean?

35:05.987 --> 35:07.170
I'm sure Gabriel
didn't tell Vanessa

35:07.172 --> 35:08.705
where he is, okay, but what if,

35:08.707 --> 35:10.574
what if she knows how to get
in touch with him?

35:10.576 --> 35:12.642
Maybe that is what
Brigante got out of her.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.345
And now that Michelle has Sara,
she can reach out to Gabriel

35:15.347 --> 35:16.680
and offer him a deal.
Right.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.782
He hands himself in,
she lets the kid go.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.584
Look, I don't give a damn
if we got proof or not,

35:20.586 --> 35:22.619
we need to drag
Michelle Shioma in

35:22.621 --> 35:24.037
and get her to tell us
where Sara is.

35:24.038 --> 35:25.454
I don't-- she's not gonna
say-- tell her what?

35:25.457 --> 35:27.057
She's not gonna say anything.
STEVE: He's right.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.658
She's not gonna talk, but
if we keep her out there,

35:28.660 --> 35:31.495
we can monitor her
and maybe get a lead.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.629
GROVER:
And what if we don't, then?

35:32.631 --> 35:34.731
How are we gonna
find Sara?

35:34.733 --> 35:36.666
Her bracelet.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.702
What about it?

35:38.704 --> 35:40.704
Chin just said something
about Sara having a bracelet.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.672
So?

35:42.674 --> 35:44.341
I worked a kidnapping case
years ago--

35:44.343 --> 35:45.675
a young daughter
of a wealthy family.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.177
The only way
we could find her

35:47.179 --> 35:48.678
was thanks to a GPS chip
in her necklace.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.614
Parents thought
she might be a target,

35:50.616 --> 35:52.066
so they made her
wear it all the time.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.517
And maybe Vanessa
took the same precautions.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.919
Maybe Sara's bracelet's
a tracker.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.754
Okay, Abby, get in touch
with every security company

35:57.756 --> 36:00.624
on the island that does
GPS monitoring of children.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.859
Let's do that right now.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.928
(steady beeping)

36:11.637 --> 36:13.770
(tires screech)

36:17.442 --> 36:18.608
No! No! No!

36:20.779 --> 36:23.680
(Sara screaming)

36:26.351 --> 36:27.751
No...!

36:35.260 --> 36:37.527
(grunting)

36:38.597 --> 36:41.631
(rapid beeping)

36:43.569 --> 36:45.635
(groans)

36:59.451 --> 37:01.718
(several different beeps)

37:07.292 --> 37:09.359
(grunts)

37:19.871 --> 37:21.738
Chin was right
about the bracelet.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.707
Vanessa used a company
called Hawkeye Security

37:23.709 --> 37:24.908
to track Sara's movements.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.643
They just sent us
the GPS coordinates.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.546
She's being held
in a house in Waimanalo.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.815
(sniffling)

37:41.026 --> 37:44.261
GROVER: All right, so I
got four infrared bodies.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.429
Looks to be
three hostiles

37:46.431 --> 37:47.897
and little Sara.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.267
DANNY: So, she's just sitting
right out there in the open.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.502
We rush in there, she can get hit in
the crossfire. (car engine humming)

37:55.507 --> 37:57.574
(door opens)

38:03.015 --> 38:04.748
Chin.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.317
Steve, don't ask me
to stand down.

38:07.319 --> 38:10.053
The little girl's my niece.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.857
(Sara sniffling)

38:13.859 --> 38:15.959
I'm gonna check the perimeter.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.366
Target in sight.

38:23.368 --> 38:24.401
Go.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.869
(gunshots)

38:36.615 --> 38:37.681
Steve, we got another one!

38:37.683 --> 38:39.349
ABBY:
Infrared didn't pick him up.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.016
He must have been downstairs.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.722
That's close enough!

38:45.724 --> 38:46.723
(Sara whimpering)

38:46.725 --> 38:49.459
Brigante.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.694
Please stop!
Please let me go!

38:50.696 --> 38:51.961
She's just a little kid.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.797
You let her go.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.799
That's not gonna happen.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.067
Let her go.

38:57.069 --> 38:58.802
Three seconds!

38:58.804 --> 39:00.003
One.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.538
Put the kid down!

39:01.540 --> 39:03.106
Two.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.774
(Sara gasps)

39:04.776 --> 39:06.042
I got her!

39:06.044 --> 39:08.411
(Sara crying)

39:08.413 --> 39:10.714
Sara, it's Lieutenant Kelly.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.781
I got you, okay?

39:11.783 --> 39:14.384
I got you.

39:14.386 --> 39:15.819
Is she all right?

39:15.821 --> 39:18.755
Yeah, I'm gonna take her out.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.824
All right,
here we go.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.797
(grunting)

39:27.799 --> 39:29.833
You okay?

39:29.835 --> 39:31.568
Sara, I'm taking
the blindfold off, okay?

39:31.570 --> 39:34.070
Okay?
Hey, you okay?

39:34.072 --> 39:35.939
All right, come here.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.075
It's okay, everything's
gonna be fine now, okay?

39:39.077 --> 39:40.009
All right.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.112
Okay.

39:42.114 --> 39:43.880
This is Officer Kalakaua.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.448
She's gonna
help us, too, okay?

39:45.450 --> 39:46.516
You're safe, okay?

39:46.518 --> 39:47.617
We got you.

39:47.619 --> 39:48.918
Let us take these off.
Yeah.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.457
Brigante.

39:54.459 --> 39:55.625
Oh, damn.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.026
This guy was
our best shot

39:57.028 --> 39:58.428
at nailing Shioma.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.830
STEVE:
Yep.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.833
But saving that kid out there?

40:03.835 --> 40:05.969
That's all that mattered.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.176

I still don't know

40:50.982 --> 40:52.916
Because surfing is awesome.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.951
And you're gonna get
a free, one-on-one lesson

40:54.953 --> 40:56.653
from a former pro.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.022
Yes, but I hate the water.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.524
And other than
getting to see me

41:01.526 --> 41:03.860
in a bathing suit,

41:03.862 --> 41:06.029
I don't know what
you get out of it.

41:06.031 --> 41:07.964
It's my way
of saying thanks.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.899
You've been
a big asset to Five-O.

41:09.901 --> 41:13.937
You've helped us close
four cases in the past year.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.104
And I want you to know
that we appreciate it.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.774
And you.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.710
Wow.

41:20.712 --> 41:24.581
I'm moved,
Officer Kalakaua.

41:24.583 --> 41:28.151
Of course, I could think
of some other ways

41:28.153 --> 41:30.119
you could show
your appreciation.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.588
Really?

41:31.589 --> 41:33.056
Uh, that-that wasn't
a sleazy come-on!

41:34.826 --> 41:37.660
It's just that I abhor the sea!

41:37.662 --> 41:41.030
There's sharks and jellyfish
and stingrays and coral reefs.

41:41.032 --> 41:44.100
If God had meant
for man to swim,

41:44.102 --> 41:45.835
he would've
given us flippers.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.637
Hirsch?

41:47.639 --> 41:48.872
I got your back.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.508
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

41:51.510 --> 41:52.542
(quietly):
Okay.

41:52.544 --> 41:55.078
Let's go.

41:55.079 --> 41:57.613
Okay, first thing,
this is your surfboard.

41:57.616 --> 41:58.982
Where's the seat?

41:58.984 --> 42:00.917
Funny. When you get
into the water,

42:00.919 --> 42:03.586
you're gonna want to lay down
on it like this and paddle.

42:03.588 --> 42:05.588
Will you give me
mouth-to-mouth if I drown?

42:05.590 --> 42:06.689
Seriously?

42:06.691 --> 42:08.057
Okay, I'll shut up now.

42:29.281 --> 42:32.315
Mommy?

42:33.952 --> 42:36.152
Hey.

42:38.857 --> 42:41.791
You slept a long time.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.860
You okay?

42:45.130 --> 42:46.696
Oh.

42:46.698 --> 42:50.266
I know someone who would love
to say hello to you.

42:51.770 --> 42:53.836
Say hi.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.877
Where's my mommy?
