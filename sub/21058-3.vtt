WEBVTT

00:26.234 --> 00:28.445
Boss, are they still there?

00:28.987 --> 00:31.281
-Yes, they're still there.
-I'm parked in Saravia.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.240
I'll wait here.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.008
-How much?
-300.

00:52.343 --> 00:53.470
Here you go.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.138
-Thanks.
-Stay on the lookout.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.915
Great song.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.375
Yeah.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.211
They play it at the nightclub.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.013
They're on Zaragoza.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.728
Did you see that truck?

01:46.564 --> 01:48.608
That asshole looks suspicious.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.360
He's closing in.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.113
Let's take a detour just in case.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.378
He turned on Revolución.
We'll follow them.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.921
I'll wait here.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.551
I don't see them.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.558
Got them.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.394
They're on Revolución.
I'm going after them.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.868
There's another car following us.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.287
-They turned on Constitución.
-We'll catch up to them there.

02:56.384 --> 02:57.760
Son of a bitch!

03:04.183 --> 03:06.394
-Fuck!
-Goddamn it!

03:07.520 --> 03:09.188
Let's go! They're shooting at us!

03:09.272 --> 03:11.232
Calm down!
We're fine inside the car!

03:11.316 --> 03:13.026
Let's go, boss!

03:13.109 --> 03:15.278
Ramón, chill!
Stay inside!

03:21.784 --> 03:24.537
Go, go, go!
They're shooting at us!

03:29.542 --> 03:31.377
Chapo, that son of a bitch.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.879
You are going to regret this, asshole!

03:44.015 --> 03:48.228
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

03:48.311 --> 03:52.523
I feel the fear sweat dripping away

03:52.607 --> 03:56.653
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:56.736 --> 04:01.908
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

04:03.952 --> 04:07.163
Even when the clouds drift away

04:07.997 --> 04:11.584
Even when my skin dries away

04:12.543 --> 04:16.172
I'll be back someday

04:16.256 --> 04:21.010
To unleash my return

04:25.473 --> 04:29.727
I have the dust
that protects the road

04:29.811 --> 04:34.148
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

04:34.232 --> 04:38.528
I'm the guardian of the tired night

04:38.611 --> 04:44.617
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

04:45.410 --> 04:48.538
Even when the clouds drift away

04:49.580 --> 04:52.959
Even when my skin dries away

04:53.710 --> 04:57.463
I'll be back someday

04:58.298 --> 05:02.635
To unleash my return

05:24.574 --> 05:25.616
Let's go.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.591
We have to check you.
That's cool, right?

05:54.896 --> 05:55.897
Chapo.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.441
Güero.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.778
I'm sorry,
but you can't be too careful.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.656
I knew you were in Tijuana

06:05.740 --> 06:07.825
trying to get revenge
for what happened to Rayo.

06:09.911 --> 06:10.912
That's not good.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.915
I'm friends
with the Avendaños.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.709
You can be their friend
all you want,

06:16.793 --> 06:18.711
but you also respect codes.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.506
That's why we called you.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.841
If you need a middleman,

06:23.925 --> 06:26.636
-I'm in.
-We want to propose an alliance.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.387
Let's drop the shit
and talk like men.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.182
You want me on your side
to fight this war.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.320
Rayo's death was unnecessary.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.739
But war is not the answer.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.033
Ramón killed Rayo just because.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.078
-And he has to pay.
-War kills business.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.039
I won't be a part of that.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.833
Not on your side, not on theirs.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.002
If you want to negotiate,
give me a call.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.879
Otherwise, I'm out.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.631
With all due respect, Don Ismael...

07:06.175 --> 07:07.176
Ismael.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.430
After Tijuana,
the Avendaños will retaliate.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.142
With or without you,
war is happening.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.910
What do you think, boss?

07:34.328 --> 07:35.455
Good.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.622
Get on it.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.499
Yes, sir.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.295
Go on.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.883
What's up, Toño?

07:48.384 --> 07:49.510
Did something happen?

07:50.595 --> 07:51.846
Where are you going?

07:51.929 --> 07:54.182
Gotta lay low for a while, honey.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.142
But you'll be safe.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.561
The guys will guard you 24/7.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.980
You're scaring me, Joaquín.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.899
It's just a precaution.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.945
I had a fight with the Avendaños.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.700
I don't want you getting hurt
because of my actions.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.959
Are you going to be okay?

08:24.629 --> 08:25.630
I'm leaving, son.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.966
-Take care of your mom.
-Yes, Dad.

08:29.050 --> 08:33.638
Don't worry, it'll be over soon
and everything will go back to normal.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.348
Be careful.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.193
How long will we be watched?

08:48.110 --> 08:51.906
As long as necessary.
I'm trying to keep you and the kids safe.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.824
Dad! Mom!

08:53.908 --> 08:54.951
-Hi.
-What's up, kiddo?

08:55.034 --> 08:58.704
-Hi, princess.
-Let's go, let's go.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.716
Hey, where's my kiss?
You won't see me for several days.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.762
Bye, princess.

09:14.845 --> 09:15.888
Get in.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.392
-Call me.
-Yes.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.104
Let's go.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.358
-Straight to the house.
-How was school?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.769
SAFE HOUSE
GUADALAJARA

10:15.239 --> 10:16.574
Who's that?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.535
Go inside.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.661
I'll be right back.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.928
I'm here on behalf of the general.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.316
Wait there.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.533
I can't stay.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.619
-Let's go back to my place.
-I can't.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.206
I can't ditch
my husband's guards.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.292
Okay. Okay.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.796
Then don't complain
when I'm with other women.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.215
Cut the crap, Rafael.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.302
If you wanted to,
you could have me all for yourself.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.056
You're crazy, Lupe.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.266
You're crazy.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.102
I'm ready to leave Güero.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.063
But you don't want to take care
of me and my kids.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.941
Or what?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.609
Did you change your mind?

12:22.950 --> 12:24.076
Asshole.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.432
Chapo Guzmán.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.393
Say what you came to say.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.062
You've been
all over the place lately.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.026
First, what you did to Mr. Livas,

12:57.109 --> 12:59.361
and now that shooting in Tijuana.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.575
-You've got nothing to say?
-No.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.203
This is your first
and only warning, Chapo.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.873
You mess up again,
and I'll lock you up.

13:11.832 --> 13:12.833
Got it?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.925
AVENDAÑOS'S WAREHOUSE
TIJUANA

13:24.845 --> 13:26.013
These are the warehouses

13:26.096 --> 13:28.349
that hold Avendaños's product
heading for the States.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.602
My contact told me
they're expecting a big shipment.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.567
These two
are the biggest warehouses

13:38.651 --> 13:39.944
closest to Otay.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.154
If I were Benjamín,
I'd use one of those.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.781
Let's hit them, then.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.412
We'll kill two birds
with one stone.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.041
They'll miss their delivery,
and they'll lose a lot of money.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.293
And then we can go after them again.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.461
Look, pal.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.507
I'm with you till the end,
but what about Blanco?

14:01.590 --> 14:04.510
-Don't you give a fuck about his warning?
-No, I don't.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.638
He wants peace
because it wasn't his pal that got killed.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.890
Otherwise, I don't think
he'd be so lenient.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.976
Boss, are you waiting for someone?

15:15.039 --> 15:18.500
LEAVING FOR OTAY
IN ONE HOUR

15:41.774 --> 15:43.233
-Let's go!
-Coming!

15:52.826 --> 15:56.538
I've just been told Chapo
stole a big shipment.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.248
Several dead.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.043
This way, please.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.754
Good evening, Mr. Ambassador.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.272
We've identified the culprits.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.733
We'll lock them up immediately.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.578
What do you suggest?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.138
It's not that simple.

16:54.221 --> 16:58.809
We'd have to evaluate everyone
to find an adequate candidate.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.271
Impossible.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.605
General...

17:15.743 --> 17:18.662
Ambassador, I assume
this is only a suggestion.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.566
Inmate 48!

17:55.407 --> 17:56.617
Door 2!

19:09.815 --> 19:11.400
I forgot the kids' drawings.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.735
Don't worry,
you won't know which ones.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.573
I'll be right back.
Come with me?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.579
Let's go.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.708
AMADO'S RANCH
JUÁREZ, MEXICO

20:02.826 --> 20:04.453
-Amado.
-Chapo.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.081
-Well.
-Amado.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.541
Güero.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.024
Wait here.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.956
Shh, stop.

20:59.925 --> 21:00.926
I'm ready.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.388
Ready for what?

21:04.471 --> 21:06.515
To take care
of you and your kids.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.643
Let's start a new life together.

21:19.486 --> 21:24.116
Thanks to your bullshit,
the gringos are coming after us.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.451
They have no reason to interfere.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.745
It is what it is.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.999
Ramón killed my friend.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.794
-I'm going to kill Ramón.
-I'm going to kill you, fucker!

21:35.877 --> 21:38.422
Back off, asshole!
Come on, back off.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.633
Back off.
Make him back off.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.431
If we keep this up,
we'll all end up in jail,

21:47.514 --> 21:49.725
and the government will be in charge,
is that what you want?

21:50.559 --> 21:52.769
-I don't forget my ghosts.
-I know that.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.647
But we need to think
with our heads,

21:55.731 --> 21:57.733
not with our guns or our dicks.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.529
What are they offering us?

22:03.822 --> 22:06.742
The government will leave us alone

22:06.825 --> 22:10.954
if I can guarantee them
we settle this war right now.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.124
-That and some profits.
-And if I say no?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.084
What?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.795
Chapo, you can't fuck with the gringos.

22:18.879 --> 22:23.091
If we don't give them
what they want, we'll go to jail.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.843
Or we'll end up dead.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.888
It's up to you!

22:37.981 --> 22:40.400
-I'm in.
-Fuck me, Benjamín.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.071
Ramón and I are in.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.864
Good, Benjamín.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.707
Come on, Joaquín.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.627
Think with your head.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.920
Don't be so hot-headed.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.048
Do not isolate yourself.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.469
Come on.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.316
Let's go. Ready?

23:27.280 --> 23:30.784
-Where are we going?
-On an adventure.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.953
-Do you see that car?
-Yes.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.455
We'll use it
to go on our adventure.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.541
The first to get to the car wins. Go.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.700
Ma'am?

24:13.910 --> 24:15.662
To unity.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.998
What do you say?
Are you up for that?

24:19.666 --> 24:20.959
-Let's do it.
-Let's go.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.335
Come on.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.088
Come, Chapo.
Come with us.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.260
If we don't keep our heads straight,
we're dead.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.304
Don't be paranoid, man.

24:32.387 --> 24:35.307
-Amado will keep them under control.
-I know them, Güero.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.685
They won't sit and relax.

24:52.532 --> 24:53.783
One with sugar.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.661
I don't want to drink it.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.872
Drink it, princess.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.499
-Don't be like that.
-Drink it before it goes cold.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.377
I'll help you.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.547
-Go on.
-And another one with more sugar.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.132
Bottoms up.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.842
-Come on.
-Thanks.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.344
You're welcome. Drink it.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.679
I told you it was delicious. Drink up.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.181
Good.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.060
Drink all of it.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.441
Time to go to bed.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.728
What's that?

26:03.812 --> 26:05.397
A surprise.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.776
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.408
It's done.

31:23.590 --> 31:24.591
Güero!

31:36.436 --> 31:37.437
Güero.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.323
Güerito.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.560
What's in the tape?

32:28.738 --> 32:30.073
My children.

32:38.748 --> 32:39.749
Kill them.

32:42.418 --> 32:43.878
Kill them all.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.980
I didn't think you'd have
the balls to show up.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.898
We came because we respect you.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.733
We didn't kill Güero's family to hurt you.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.069
We said we'd have peace, you fuckers.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.780
The government won't care
about those deaths.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.907
There's a code, asshole.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.660
Not all of us are savages like you.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.912
We had to stop those fuckers.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.165
After Colombia,
Chapo had to be stopped.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.209
He was growing too strong.

33:23.292 --> 33:25.211
We have to exterminate
bad seeds before they grow.

33:25.294 --> 33:28.381
Now everyone knows
they can't mess with us.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.508
-Are you threatening me, fucker?
-On the contrary.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.469
We did this for you.

33:33.553 --> 33:36.597
Chapo wouldn't have stopped
until you were dead, Amado.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.475
After what we did to Güero,

33:39.559 --> 33:42.061
he knows what we can do
to him. Or to his family.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.688
Güero is out of the game.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.065
Now Chapo won't have
the power nor the balls

33:46.149 --> 33:47.692
to fight us.

33:51.988 --> 33:55.033
The Avendaños crossed a line
they shouldn't have crossed.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.412
Between us, everything goes.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.582
But we don't mess with our families.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.793
Are you in?

34:11.924 --> 34:14.260
Benjamín organized
my birthday party.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.222
I'll organize his
in Puerto Vallarta.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.196
SAFE HOUSE
GUADALAJARA

34:33.279 --> 34:36.282
-How many men do you need?
-An army.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.034
That's why I called you, pal.

34:38.117 --> 34:40.620
I'm a politician,
not a magician, Chapo.

34:40.703 --> 34:43.164
If I wasn't sure you could do it,
I wouldn't be talking to you.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.961
What kind of trouble
are you in, asshole?

34:49.045 --> 34:51.547
-Big trouble.
-Isn't this cool?

34:51.631 --> 34:54.133
It's amazing.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.260
Such a pity
Rosaura couldn't be here.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.805
She had to stay
to take care of our kid.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.056
He got sick
all of a sudden.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.518
-Look.
-Thank you, man.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.270
I thought about telling you
to cancel everything.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.564
To lay low, you know.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.984
And celebrate your birthday
locked up at home?

35:12.068 --> 35:14.237
-No way.
-So?

35:14.904 --> 35:16.155
Can I count on you?

35:53.484 --> 35:54.819
Stop there! Police!

36:09.375 --> 36:12.295
Everything all right
with the shipment? You happy?

36:12.378 --> 36:13.880
Everything's good, man.

37:07.808 --> 37:08.976
Happy birthday, bro.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.811
-Thanks.
-Here's to many more.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.979
Cheers!

37:13.648 --> 37:15.441
Thank you, man, so much.

37:16.692 --> 37:19.028
You know
how to treat your friends.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.780
And this is only the beginning.

37:21.864 --> 37:24.659
I booked Christine
to keep the party going.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.828
Christine? For real? That's amazing!

37:27.912 --> 37:30.873
I'll head to the hotel to grab
your present and I'll see you there.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.834
-Another one?
-Of course.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.712
Send your wives upstairs to rest.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.091
-I'll see you there.
-Why? I want to party, too.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.676
You're staying.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.345
That party's for men only.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.824
From now on,

38:04.907 --> 38:07.493
you follow Toño's orders.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.996
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

38:11.789 --> 38:13.124
Don't let them get away.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.948
Kiss me.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.283
That's so nice...

38:49.035 --> 38:50.995
-Let go of me, asshole!
-Easy there.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.371
I'm sorry, bro.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.665
You're so boring.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.376
You should find a girl
and celebrate your birthday.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.837
You know
I'm not looking for a fight, Lobito.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.173
So have fun,
but be careful, asshole.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.508
-Don Ismael on the phone. Don Ismael.
-Who?

39:04.592 --> 39:07.970
Hey, pal, you here?

39:08.054 --> 39:09.180
No, man.

39:09.263 --> 39:13.017
I'm so sorry,
but that food didn't settle well with me.

39:13.100 --> 39:16.354
See? That's what happens
when you eat too much, pal.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.938
Okay.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.690
Have a good night.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.817
Thanks, man.
See you in Tijuana.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.195
-What?
-Ismael, he's not coming.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.738
Ismael is not coming.

39:25.821 --> 39:28.074
I think we should go, Ramón.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.450
So soon?

39:30.910 --> 39:32.828
No way, man,
it's your birthday!

39:32.912 --> 39:35.706
I'm leaving.
If you want to stay, go ahead.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.459
But be careful.
Remember, we're at war.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.711
Don't fuck up, asshole.

39:41.712 --> 39:44.298
-Take care of them.
-Hey, asshole.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.008
She was pretty.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.010
-Look at her.
-Indeed.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.429
There's still time, Joaquín.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.015
We should tell Amado.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.642
If he were a real boss, I'd do it.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.896
But he did nothing
to punish the murder of Güero's kids.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.899
What's going on?

40:03.025 --> 40:04.318
We're almost there.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.198
We're going in, boss.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.164
Wait a minute, okay?

41:01.125 --> 41:02.334
Lobito!

41:12.261 --> 41:13.596
I'll be right back, love.

41:17.641 --> 41:20.311
Let's do some blow, brother.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.490
-I don't see them.
-They have to be there.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.203
Police!

41:49.965 --> 41:51.217
-How many?
-Too many, boss.

42:08.984 --> 42:10.528
Let's go, Lobito!

42:22.957 --> 42:24.792
Come on, come on,
Lobito, fuck.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.474
Drop it!

42:51.110 --> 42:53.195
Boss, Ramón got away.

42:54.697 --> 42:55.823
But we have Lobito.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.119
I want him alive.

43:04.164 --> 43:05.499
What are you gonna do?

43:06.709 --> 43:08.794
Lobito had nothing to do
with those murders.

43:08.877 --> 43:10.629
His brothers broke our codes,
they have to pay.

43:10.713 --> 43:11.880
But not like this.

43:13.132 --> 43:16.135
If you hurt Lobito,
they'll come for our families!

43:16.969 --> 43:20.389
Güero asked me to kill everyone,
and that's what I'll do.

43:20.472 --> 43:21.765
Then you're on your own.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.311
This is the end of our deal.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.646
I won't keep helping you.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.783
-What happened, Jimmy?
-There was an attack at the nightclub.

43:39.867 --> 43:40.993
Chapo's men.

43:41.076 --> 43:43.162
-Where are my brothers?
-I don't know, boss.

43:43.245 --> 43:46.248
-What happened, Benjamín?
-Go grab your things. We're leaving.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.917
It's me, it's me!

43:50.002 --> 43:51.378
Where's Lobito, Ramón?

43:53.756 --> 43:55.549
Where's Lobito?

43:55.633 --> 43:57.301
Fuck.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.388
Goddamn it!

44:25.954 --> 44:27.247
Don't kill me, please.

44:29.541 --> 44:31.085
Do you know
what your brothers did?

44:39.718 --> 44:42.012
-Fucking asshole!
-Need a hand, boss?

44:44.848 --> 44:46.016
Leave us alone.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.020
They killed her.

44:50.104 --> 44:52.523
-But I'm innocent.
-How did they kill her?

44:53.732 --> 44:56.110
They cut her throat
and sent her head to Güero,

44:56.193 --> 44:57.361
-but...
-And the kids?

44:59.947 --> 45:00.948
How did they kill them?

45:02.074 --> 45:04.785
-I don't know.
-They threw them off a bridge.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.123
They were four and five years old.

45:10.290 --> 45:11.458
Son of a bitch!

45:16.672 --> 45:18.841
And you're begging me
not to kill you.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.885
I'm innocent, sir.

45:23.137 --> 45:24.430
Please.

45:41.196 --> 45:42.489
Are you an Avendaño?

45:45.534 --> 45:46.702
I asked you a question!

45:51.874 --> 45:53.041
There he is, fucker.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.420
Lobito!

45:58.005 --> 45:59.089
Lobito!

46:00.299 --> 46:01.341
Lobito!

46:01.425 --> 46:02.593
Lobito...

46:05.846 --> 46:06.847
You're okay.

46:06.930 --> 46:08.807
-You're okay...
-Are you okay, fucker?

46:17.733 --> 46:18.734
Come on.

46:19.401 --> 46:20.527
Give me a hand.

46:22.529 --> 46:24.072
-Can you stand?
-Easy, easy.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.075
I can do it!

46:27.159 --> 46:29.036
-Did they hurt you, fucker?
-No!

46:30.996 --> 46:32.247
Lobito, I'm sorry.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.001
Let's go.

46:38.837 --> 46:40.005
Let's go.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.728
I'm so sorry, Güero.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.569
Call me if you need anything.

47:09.243 --> 47:10.702
Why didn't you kill Lobito?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.709
Because Ismael is right.

47:18.919 --> 47:24.132
-If I had, our families would die.
-My family is already dead.

47:26.426 --> 47:28.595
But Benjamín and Ramón
are still alive.

47:28.679 --> 47:29.888
This isn't over, Güerito.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.308
I swear.

47:36.979 --> 47:41.108
And you, as parents,

47:41.191 --> 47:43.235
have the moral obligation

47:43.318 --> 47:46.154
to teach your kids good values.

47:47.906 --> 47:51.368
Every day that passes,
drug trafficking

47:51.451 --> 47:54.830
invades every single place
in Mexican society.

47:58.667 --> 48:01.128
Civilians died, motherfucker!

48:01.211 --> 48:04.047
Everyone's talking
about the nightclub shooting!

48:04.131 --> 48:07.426
It is what it is, man.
But then, people forget it.

48:07.509 --> 48:09.428
I don't give a shit!

48:09.511 --> 48:11.013
Drug lords,

48:11.096 --> 48:13.640
those lords of death,

48:13.724 --> 48:16.518
who drive expensive cars

48:16.602 --> 48:18.520
and attend big events

48:18.604 --> 48:22.566
without showing an ounce of pity

48:22.649 --> 48:25.777
for the addiction
they create in our youth.

48:26.695 --> 48:29.781
I leave you with these words...

48:31.325 --> 48:33.410
and ask our Heavenly Father

48:33.493 --> 48:37.039
to show us the light
at the end of the tunnel.

48:37.122 --> 48:39.666
We named you leader to keep the peace.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.460
If you can't do that,
you'll go back to jail.

48:41.543 --> 48:43.420
You'll have your peace.

48:45.881 --> 48:48.508
I'm going to kill Chapo Guzmán.

49:27.714 --> 49:30.509
