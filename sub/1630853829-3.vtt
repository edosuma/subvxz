11:06.241 --> 11:07.779
What I'm trying to say,

11:07.812 --> 11:10.150
is that we cry
for those that we've lost.

11:10.183 --> 11:11.285
(war cries)

11:11.318 --> 11:15.060
(crying continues)

11:15.093 --> 11:18.132
Like that.
You know, we mourn them.

11:18.165 --> 11:20.403
We cut our hair,
we cut ourselves.

11:20.436 --> 11:22.140
We go through all the feels.

11:22.173 --> 11:24.144
We take our relatives--
their bodies--

11:24.177 --> 11:25.781
and make clothing out of it.

11:25.814 --> 11:27.819
This is my auntie right here.

11:27.852 --> 11:29.923
We airbrush their faces
on our T-shirts,

11:29.956 --> 11:33.429
get their names tattooed on our
bodies in old English script.

11:33.462 --> 11:35.935
We tear ourselves to pieces

11:35.968 --> 11:39.408
so that we can build ourselves
new on the other side.

11:39.441 --> 11:41.947
You go through all of it

11:41.980 --> 11:46.155
so that they know
that they can go,

11:46.188 --> 11:49.763
that we'll miss them,

11:49.796 --> 11:52.869
but that we'll be okay
without them.

11:52.902 --> 11:54.873
(distant beeping)

11:54.906 --> 11:56.309
So, wait. What you mean is...?

11:56.342 --> 11:59.415
Shh. You hear that?
Ghost dogs.

11:59.448 --> 12:01.953
Somebody's heart fear is
stronger than yours, Little Cub.

12:01.986 --> 12:04.391
I got to go.
Check you later.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.462

13:09.956 --> 13:11.359

13:11.392 --> 13:13.062
You know why we used
to call this guy "The Marksman"?

13:13.095 --> 13:15.100
-Why?
-Back in the day,
he used to be able

13:15.133 --> 13:16.536
to shoot the ball
from anywhere on the court.

13:16.569 --> 13:18.841
-Damn. Really?
-Hell yeah, he could shoot it.

13:18.874 --> 13:21.178
He wouldn't make it,
but he'd still shoot it.

13:21.211 --> 13:23.917
Man, you're throwing
a whole lot of dirt on my name

13:23.950 --> 13:26.222
for somebody who drove
all the way to All-Native

13:26.255 --> 13:28.025
and dropped out
'cause he had diarrhea.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.531
Fucker left at halftime

hot dogs ain't no joke.

to play basketball, too?

Hell yeah. Me, this guy...

all the time.

13:41.619 --> 13:43.557
-My dad?
-Yeah.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.028
Before he had dreams
of becoming a rapper and shit.

13:46.061 --> 13:49.101
Yeah. And forgetting
about his family.

13:49.134 --> 13:51.873
-There it is.

You should know.

14:16.421 --> 14:19.428
MARC DON: Look, I'm-a tell you
what somebody once told me.

14:19.461 --> 14:21.633
You got to let a man
make his mistakes.

14:21.666 --> 14:23.436
Whether it be your daddy,
your uncle,

14:23.469 --> 14:25.273
your brother,
your boyfriend, whatever.

14:25.306 --> 14:26.610
You let a man make his mistakes

14:26.643 --> 14:28.514
because men learn
from experience.

14:28.547 --> 14:31.018
Why you think you on that roof
without a safety board,

14:31.051 --> 14:33.322

chasing after shingles?

14:33.355 --> 14:36.095
'Cause you guys ain't
taking precautions?

14:36.128 --> 14:38.232
Because if you slip once,
you learn from it.

14:38.265 --> 14:40.102
If you slip again,
you're just being careless.

14:41.471 --> 14:44.478
Yeah, there's a lot
of careless dudes out here.

14:58.138 --> 15:01.312

to God, this is a true story.

Oh, you don't need
to help me, man. I'll be fine.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.997
Danny,

15:27.030 --> 15:29.401
I'm sorry back there.

15:29.434 --> 15:31.438
I didn't mean it.

15:31.471 --> 15:33.677
I'm just in a bad mood.

15:33.710 --> 15:36.315
Yeah. Yeah, well, shit.
Long as you're here,

15:36.348 --> 15:38.252
you might as well learn
how to do this shit.

15:39.221 --> 15:40.490
I'm gonna mess it up, though.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.060
Ah, you can't be any worse

15:42.093 --> 15:43.530
than Charlie's work
over there. Come on.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.372
Here, let's... let's-let's
get this one right here.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.376
You see this line? You just got
to line it up on the left

15:50.409 --> 15:52.748
-all the way along the bottom
to the right.
-Okay.

15:52.781 --> 15:55.152
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Just like that.

15:57.156 --> 15:58.593
Got your hammer?

15:59.762 --> 16:01.465
-Right here?
-You got it.

16:01.499 --> 16:03.236
-Yeah?
-Little bit to the end.

16:03.269 --> 16:04.639
-Little bit to the end.
There you go.
-Yeah?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.676
Perfect. Perfect. Send it.

16:09.515 --> 16:11.318
All right.

16:11.351 --> 16:13.189
See how I hold my hammer?
Little bit down.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.059
Choke down just a little bit
so you let the weight

16:15.092 --> 16:17.230
-of the hammer do it. All right?
-Uh-huh.

16:17.263 --> 16:19.101
Let's try another one.

16:19.134 --> 16:20.470
-Like that.
-Like that?

16:20.504 --> 16:22.508
Just like that.

16:22.541 --> 16:24.077
Yeah.

16:25.313 --> 16:27.483
-(laughs) Cool.
-You got it.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.561
Hey, how's Elora anyway?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.205
She... she left town.

16:38.238 --> 16:40.442
Like, moved?

16:41.411 --> 16:42.815
Sort of.

16:42.848 --> 16:45.620
Really? When?

16:48.158 --> 16:50.229
A few days ago.

16:50.262 --> 16:53.102
It feels like longer, but...

16:53.135 --> 16:55.239
I was supposed
to go with her, too,

16:55.272 --> 16:57.143
but she just got up and left me.

16:58.580 --> 17:02.521
She hasn't been the same since,
you know...

17:02.554 --> 17:04.525
You know.

17:04.558 --> 17:07.498
(sighs) I reckon none of us
have been the same.

17:07.531 --> 17:09.367
(Danny groans)

17:14.177 --> 17:16.783
(Danny sighs)

17:16.816 --> 17:19.087
Everything's changed.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.862
Me and Hokti split up.

17:22.895 --> 17:24.765
Really?

17:27.604 --> 17:29.240
I didn't know that.

17:30.577 --> 17:32.815
I saw that you guys moved.

17:32.848 --> 17:36.154
Just couldn't stand to walk
in that fucking house anymore.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.630
Drive down them streets.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.811
I'm sorry.

17:48.780 --> 17:50.751
I don't even know
how long it's been.

17:50.784 --> 17:52.822
I still can't get over it.

17:52.855 --> 17:56.830
I got all these scenarios
playing over in my head.

17:56.863 --> 17:58.600
(Bear sniffles)

17:58.633 --> 18:01.305
Like, how could I have changed?

18:01.338 --> 18:03.408
How could I have been
a better father?

18:04.879 --> 18:06.850
Maybe he'd still be here

18:06.883 --> 18:08.886
and I'd still have my family.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.561
I quit drinking since.

18:14.598 --> 18:16.168
(Bear sniffles)

18:16.201 --> 18:20.711
Well, you said, uh,
Elora left you behind?

18:20.744 --> 18:22.982
Where was you all going?

18:26.823 --> 18:28.860
California.

18:30.296 --> 18:32.935
It was Daniel's idea.

18:32.968 --> 18:36.474
He always talked about that
when he was a little guy.

18:38.513 --> 18:41.786
Used to tell him I'd take him.

18:41.819 --> 18:44.525
Shit. I didn't even have
enough money to get to Tulsa.

18:46.496 --> 18:48.332
Fucking good for Elora.

18:48.365 --> 18:50.470
I'm glad she went.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.507
Wish he would've went.

18:56.649 --> 18:58.720
I feel bad, too.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.362
What do you have
to feel bad for?

19:03.395 --> 19:05.800
You're his friend.
You were there for him.

19:07.738 --> 19:09.942
-I wasn't.
-No.

19:09.975 --> 19:11.946
You're young.

19:11.979 --> 19:13.517
It's not up to you.

19:13.550 --> 19:15.386
It's the adults.

19:15.419 --> 19:17.958
We didn't see it,
so that's on us.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.798
It's not on you.

19:20.831 --> 19:22.968
Look, I-I ain't
got nothing else to say

19:23.001 --> 19:25.239
that you want to hear.

19:26.843 --> 19:29.247
But you shouldn't listen
to these guys.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.817
Or me.

19:31.819 --> 19:34.559
You know I was a shitty dad.

19:34.592 --> 19:37.965
But you're gonna grow up
and be a man.

19:37.998 --> 19:40.704
And a man isn't someone
who walks around

19:40.737 --> 19:44.311
and makes mistakes and hopes
that they're gonna do better.

19:44.344 --> 19:45.948
That's what a shitass does.

19:45.981 --> 19:50.423
A man knows that whatever
he does has consequences.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.597
So you got to be good
