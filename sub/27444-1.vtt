00:44.461 --> 00:46.462
Jesus, I don't know.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.966
I'm trying to, you know, sum my life up.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.517
And I can't.. It's difficult to do that.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.599
I was frightened it
was going to be walking

00:58.600 --> 01:01.811
over old territory and
what you really wanted

01:01.812 --> 01:05.313
was something, remember
those confession programmes

01:05.315 --> 01:06.607
on television.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.532
John Freeman used to be the
man who interviewed people.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.790
And with the camera just
relentlessly on them,

01:13.791 --> 01:15.199
often in closeup.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.871
You waited for the tears to fall

01:16.872 --> 01:20.338
as the questions about their
mother were answered in sobs.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.174
He tried to break people down.

01:23.175 --> 01:26.377
And you saw the real
person behind the image.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.881
Well, I don't really have an image, do I?

01:28.882 --> 01:30.256
I'm an actor.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.257
Those are my images.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.728
And beyond that, I try to be myself.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.763
I am interviewed an awful lot.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.768
And I've learnt long ago to
edit myself as I go along.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.110
You're announced.

01:44.479 --> 01:49.701
Your public persona is briefly
described and on you walk.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.203
Now, do I walk on modestly,
do I walk on confidently,

01:55.204 --> 01:58.993
do I betray that I'm scared stiff

01:58.994 --> 02:00.870
because I don't know what the
questions are going to be?

02:00.871 --> 02:03.249
Very difficult just to be yourself.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.344
So I treat it as a bit of acting.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.846
Oh, here comes Ian McKellen.

02:16.178 --> 02:20.775
Now, what side of Ian McKellen
am I going to present?

02:27.731 --> 02:32.953
The idea that an actor is
discovered and their lives change,

02:34.863 --> 02:36.661
it might, but you're
not really aware of it.

02:36.662 --> 02:39.126
Then or afterwards.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.831
Your life is a series of
events, interconnected.

02:45.207 --> 02:50.429
I suppose the most crucial decision I made

02:50.671 --> 02:55.893
was deciding to try and
become a professional actor.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.807
Looking back at the point in
which I made that decision,

03:00.808 --> 03:05.232
which was toward the end of
my first year at university,

03:09.773 --> 03:12.608
it does look as if from an early age

03:12.609 --> 03:15.988
I had been preparing for
that moment, but I hadn't.

03:15.989 --> 03:18.322
But it looks like that.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.540
It makes sense.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.961
My love of theatre and my
sister's love of theatre

03:22.962 --> 03:25.538
came from my mother and father.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.879
And my mother did a little
bit of amateur acting.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.297
The first time I ever
appeared on any stage.

03:35.006 --> 03:38.351
If you're a boy and your sister's
five years older than you,

03:38.352 --> 03:43.347
that is a gap that's never
quite bridged, and never was.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.683
Jean's dead now.

03:45.684 --> 03:49.019
No, Jean was a member of a secret society.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.106
She organised with some girlfriends.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.733
And I think the second rule of which

03:53.734 --> 03:56.578
was Ian McKellen may not
belong to the society.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.574
Still rankles a bit, that.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.581
I was brought up in the
northwest of England

04:04.582 --> 04:06.672
in the little mining town of Wigan.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.290
(chattering)

04:09.291 --> 04:12.006
I liked nothing better
than going into town

04:12.007 --> 04:15.631
and just spending an hour
and a half looking at things.

04:15.632 --> 04:17.505
And there was a weekly market.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.851
Stalls were set up by people
just for the Saturday.

04:20.853 --> 04:24.054
And I would go with my sweet ration

04:24.055 --> 04:27.475
and just wander around
the stalls and watch.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.186
Each of them were selling their wares.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.235
They put on a little show, you see.

04:32.236 --> 04:35.816
Every sort of 20 minutes,
they did their pitch.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.866
A man selling hair restorer
wore a wig, I noticed.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.328
(chuckling)

04:43.533 --> 04:46.127
There was a man who sold
a polish for your tables.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.126
A little crowd would
gather around these people

04:49.127 --> 04:51.716
as they said their pitch.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.970
And sometimes I was called into help.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.930
You don't know me, son, do you?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.719
Never met me before, no answer.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.094
Yes, well here, even a kid can do this.

05:02.095 --> 05:04.187
And I'd put on the black polish for him.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.849
Performers, you see.

05:06.850 --> 05:08.725
Right up close to performers I was.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.479
The fair, that was very important.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.856
Fun fair arrived twice a year.

05:15.857 --> 05:19.109
Took over the main square in town.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.529
Set up all their rides.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.909
They ran the rides, there were
stalls that sold black peas,

05:24.910 --> 05:27.752
and it was Her Majesty's Smallest Subject.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.836
Wonderful marquee.

05:31.837 --> 05:33.755
A light landing on Anita.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.715
Who was inside the booth.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.386
And you paid threepence and you went on in

05:40.387 --> 05:43.431
and there was the smallest
woman I've ever seen.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.180
She was about that high.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.228
Smoking a cigarette.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.983
In a cigarette holder so
it wouldn't burn her skin.

05:53.984 --> 05:55.401
She had a little high voice.

05:55.402 --> 05:58.858
Move on, move on, go on, you've had enough.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.277
(chuckling)

06:01.278 --> 06:03.622
And the first smell I was attracted to

06:03.623 --> 06:08.576
were the greasy-haired
tight-trousered young men

06:08.577 --> 06:11.370
who were running the caterpillar

06:11.371 --> 06:14.331
and the big wheel and all that.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.208
Fair, very important.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.626
And I went around there on my own.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.755
This was only five minutes
from where we lived.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.178
So adventurous.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.388
When I was about eight, there
was a big event in Wigan.

06:27.389 --> 06:29.763
The town stopped because the king

06:29.764 --> 06:32.141
and queen were visiting us.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.475
Exciting.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.570
And I thought, "How do they do this?"

06:37.772 --> 06:39.818
"They've got a light on in that car."

06:39.819 --> 06:41.068
"They're wearing makeup."

06:43.236 --> 06:45.326
"They've made this look very impressive."

06:45.327 --> 06:48.369
"This is our town, this
is where I go to school."

06:48.370 --> 06:49.663
"I cross this street every day."

06:49.664 --> 06:53.162
"And now, no traffic except that car."

06:53.163 --> 06:55.541
Someone's organised that, I thought.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.888
So, at a very early age I was
thinking how to put on a show.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.973
I don't know where it came from

07:03.974 --> 07:07.094
or what made me do it on the
particular day that I did.

07:07.095 --> 07:10.097
I went up and I painted
a little moustache here

07:10.098 --> 07:14.475
and mussed up my hair and found a hat

07:14.476 --> 07:16.729
and came down waddling
like Charlie Chaplin.

07:16.730 --> 07:17.854
And everyone laughed.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.859
I dressed up as Sir Thomas Beecham,

07:23.860 --> 07:27.988
who was a famous
classical music conductor.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.367
A bit of cotton wool for
his beard and moustache.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.789
Once, when I was about eight or nine,

07:33.790 --> 07:36.914
I went out into the street with
my clothes on back to front.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.666
Easy enough for the
jacket and the trousers

07:38.667 --> 07:41.637
and the shirt and tie
that tied at the back.

07:41.638 --> 07:43.379
Tricky with the shoes.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.474
You can't get the shoes
in the wrong direction.

07:45.475 --> 07:47.716
And I would go out in the street.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.140
Tried to fool people that I was...

07:51.388 --> 07:55.438
You see, I walked backwards to
appear to be walking forward.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.313
It's very, very intensely
human activity, acting.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.442
I had a different accent at school

08:03.443 --> 08:05.192
than the one I used at home to fit in.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.536
And I was acting.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.529
All the world's a stage

08:08.530 --> 08:10.823
and all the men and
women are merely players.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.451
They have their exits and their entrances.

08:12.452 --> 08:14.703
And one man, in his
time, plays many parts.

08:15.662 --> 08:20.884
Human beings, as opposed to
animals, act all day long.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.299
Select when they get up in
the morning what costume

08:23.300 --> 08:25.509
they will wear, what impact they want,

08:25.510 --> 08:28.721
what side of their
personality will be expressed.

08:28.722 --> 08:30.056
You're never just yourself.

08:30.057 --> 08:31.394
You're a part of yourself.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.975
My contemporaries would define themselves

08:37.976 --> 08:40.820
by their relationships with girls.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.235
I had this compensation that Ian

08:49.237 --> 08:52.912
was the lad who loved the theatre.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.457
That's what it felt like, I think,

08:56.458 --> 08:59.705
that when I woke up in
the morning (gasping)

08:59.706 --> 09:01.003
we're going to the theatre tonight.

09:01.004 --> 09:03.422
Oh, I'm going to rehearse a play today.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.128
That was sort of how I defined myself

09:06.129 --> 09:09.008
and what gave me real satisfaction.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.635
For my mother's birthday in 1948,

09:13.636 --> 09:16.435
the family went and
sat in the dress circle

09:16.436 --> 09:19.935
to see a new musical
written by Iva Lovello.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.812
He wrote very, very successful musicals

09:23.813 --> 09:26.190
in which he starred, although
he didn't sing himself.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.283
He played the piano.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.489
And when he lent over the side of a sofa

09:33.490 --> 09:36.539
and gave a glass of
champagne to the leading lady

09:36.540 --> 09:38.911
who was reclining on the couch,

09:38.912 --> 09:41.665
aged nine or so, I had an erection.

09:44.167 --> 09:48.378
I could quote David Hockney who said

09:48.379 --> 09:51.131
when he was about the same
age, he went to the cinema,

09:51.132 --> 09:53.472
and the man next to him
put his hand on his cock

09:53.473 --> 09:56.312
and David says, "I've loved
the cinema ever since."

09:57.430 --> 09:59.853
The same could be said
to me about the theatre.

10:01.559 --> 10:06.235
I suppose I felt I was
different, and that concerned me.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.196
And when it came to
sexuality, there was silence.

10:10.197 --> 10:12.194
I was blind, there was nothing to see,

10:12.195 --> 10:14.448
nothing to hear, nothing to feel.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.876
Making me feel, in a
sense, I didn't exist.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.410
[Interviewer] Were you
conscious of the fact

10:20.411 --> 10:22.037
that it was illegal...

10:22.038 --> 10:23.038
No.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.466
I just didn't think about it.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.714
It wasn't a problem, it was just a fact.

10:30.715 --> 10:32.135
And I (sighing)...

10:38.179 --> 10:42.432
It's strange, looking back,
when I meet 13 year old

10:42.433 --> 10:46.188
boys and girls who are pretty
certain about their sexuality,

10:46.189 --> 10:50.566
can even define it, put a
label on it, talk about it.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.944
It's another world.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.238
I suppose I was repressed.

10:54.239 --> 10:57.081
I suppose the fact that
it wasn't talked about

10:57.082 --> 11:00.617
and that I didn't talk
about it meant that I was

11:00.618 --> 11:04.830
not really developing
in a very healthy way.

11:04.831 --> 11:10.053
Probably one of the reasons
why I enjoyed acting,

11:10.378 --> 11:15.215
I could deal with emotions
and self-expression

11:15.216 --> 11:16.843
in a very public way.

11:17.844 --> 11:21.439
Which I couldn't do in real life.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.686
And if it was a substitute
for an interest in sex,

11:25.687 --> 11:30.355
then no wonder it's stayed
with me as long as it has.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.857
I had a secret.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.532
Didn't talk about it,
didn't understand it.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.824
But it was mine.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.328
When we got to Bolton and I was 12,

11:44.329 --> 11:45.831
there were three theatres.

11:45.832 --> 11:50.506
At the Grand, there was a
changing bill of variety acts.

11:51.544 --> 11:56.766
Singers, dancers, comics,
magicians, singing troupes.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.803
Quite famous, some of them,
had been on the radio.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.351
On a Tuesday, when I
knocked on the stage door,

12:04.352 --> 12:05.851
Mr. Bleakely said I can go down.

12:05.852 --> 12:07.601
Oh yeah, go down in.

12:07.602 --> 12:10.105
I'd go down onto the stage level.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.734
And in the dark and the
dust, there were these ropes

12:15.735 --> 12:18.284
going up to the flies
that pulled the scenery.

12:20.323 --> 12:23.122
I went into the dressing
rooms, I met these performers.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.833
Having a wretched life, I suppose.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.123
Paid very little money.

12:27.124 --> 12:29.624
Touring around a different town each week.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.044
Every week of their lives.

12:33.753 --> 12:38.975
But when they stepped out
into the light of the stage

12:39.050 --> 12:41.394
from the darkness, they were transformed.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.691
They smiled, they preened,
they presented themselves.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.144
I'd go and stand by the stage manager.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.031
And I could hear the audience

12:54.032 --> 12:56.651
laughing and clapping, gasping.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.739
I'm always looking for that
dividing line in the theatre.

13:00.740 --> 13:03.742
When are you onstage,
when are you backstage?

13:03.743 --> 13:08.287
And these wonderful troupers
knew that world so well

13:08.288 --> 13:11.790
and I just was fascinated by it.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.336
It was going backstage there

13:13.337 --> 13:16.338
and meeting professional
performers at close quarters,

13:16.339 --> 13:20.757
I think, which decided my fate
and that it was inevitable,

13:20.758 --> 13:22.679
although I didn't feel it at the time,

13:22.680 --> 13:24.350
that I would become one of them.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.811
While other boys were playing football

13:27.812 --> 13:31.061
or while other boys were
playing in the playground,

13:33.104 --> 13:35.027
while others were going
to the scout troop,

13:36.107 --> 13:38.781
I was putting on plays, every turn.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.163
It defined me.

13:47.410 --> 13:51.038
I was constantly trying to improve,

13:51.039 --> 13:54.213
trying to work out ways of
which I could get better.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.092
I would, on a Monday
morning, knowing the lines,

14:00.093 --> 14:02.341
knowing the plot, look
in the mirror and think,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.885
what does this character look like?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.638
And it was the mirror that helped me.

14:06.639 --> 14:10.140
I'd try on those moustaches,
pull those faces and,

14:10.141 --> 14:11.643
oh I see, oh that'll do.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.777
I was brought up by a very
loving group of people.

14:16.778 --> 14:21.244
But North Wales is where we
most went for our holidays

14:22.195 --> 14:25.870
to be with them, bicycling
together, black berrying.

14:27.992 --> 14:33.089
Yeah, that's a big part of what
I enjoyed about being a kid.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.549
When I was away in a school
camp and my uncle John

14:38.550 --> 14:40.012
came down to tell me.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.180
And I then defined myself <i>as</i> Ian

14:50.181 --> 14:52.354
was the boy whose mother had died.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.611
My mother died of breast cancer.

15:02.652 --> 15:07.874
Love, comfort, hugs, kisses.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.921
I never talked to a
psychiatrist about this but

15:21.087 --> 15:24.840
my dreams after she
died were that my father

15:24.841 --> 15:30.063
had put her away, hidden
her, taken her away.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.935
And sometimes in the
dream, she would come back.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.232
And there would be a
wonderful reconciliation

15:42.233 --> 15:47.455
of a woman who was not quite herself...

15:49.490 --> 15:52.494
but still loved me.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.674
I felt at the time I didn't feel it.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.716
But I must have done, and I still do.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.429
It was her having said to her sister

16:07.430 --> 16:09.972
reported to me after her death that if Ian

16:09.973 --> 16:12.140
decides to become an actor, she'd be happy

16:12.141 --> 16:15.017
because actors bring
such pleasure to people.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.984
And I didn't need anybody else's approval.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.276
When I left home to go to university,

16:26.277 --> 16:29.279
I think I rather knew I wouldn't go back,

16:29.280 --> 16:33.158
because I had become, I might join in

16:33.159 --> 16:37.039
with this other part of the
world which I could relate to.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.386
There is a world
elsewhere, Coriolanus <i>says,</i>

16:43.387 --> 16:48.048
and I knew what world it
was that I was intrigued by.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.427
To get into Cambridge, which
is a series of colleges

16:50.428 --> 16:54.513
which have their own entrance
exams, I failed at all those.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.562
But there was one last chance.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.778
And I went for an interview.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.608
(knocking)

17:06.400 --> 17:08.242
He was smoking Bachelor cigarettes

17:08.243 --> 17:13.208
and he offered me a glass
of South African Sherry.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.338
And he said, "I hear you are an actor."

17:29.257 --> 17:30.257
Yes, sir.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.976
[Ian Voiceover] I don't like actors.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.019
Read any Shakespeare?

17:38.891 --> 17:39.767
Yes, sir.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.231
I played King Henry V, sir.

17:41.232 --> 17:42.945
[Ian Voiceover] Do me a speech.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.189
Now, sir?

17:47.650 --> 17:48.822
[Ian Voiceover] So I put my glass down

17:48.823 --> 17:50.819
and I stood on the chair and I said...

17:50.820 --> 17:54.620
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.746
Or close the wall up
with our English dead.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.542
In peace there's nothing so

18:02.543 --> 18:04.630
becomes a man <i>as</i> modest stillness...

18:04.631 --> 18:06.172
And he gave me an exhibition lesson

18:06.173 --> 18:07.877
and a minor scholarship.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.347
(chuckling)

18:16.304 --> 18:18.976
So, the most important
audition I ever did in my life,

18:18.977 --> 18:20.850
and that's how I got into Cambridge.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.275
The assumption was that
you would work hard

18:25.276 --> 18:29.274
at Cambridge academically,
and I was warned not

18:29.275 --> 18:34.497
to go down the previous path
that Peter Hall had followed.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.745
I did 21 productions in three years

18:36.746 --> 18:40.201
with amateur undergraduate
groups in Cambridge.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.168
And most of the people there
spoke with a posher accent

18:42.169 --> 18:43.585
than I did and that's when I get rid

18:43.586 --> 18:46.833
of my Lanarkshire accent,
I mean quite deliberately.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.585
Other undergraduates are
doing the same sort of thing.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.338
I mean, who would guess
that Derek Jacobi comes

18:51.339 --> 18:53.173
from deepest, Leytonstone.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.472
No, he had a bit of a posh accent too.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.511
Although my first year
I was living in digs.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.185
I couldn't work there
because of the television on

19:00.186 --> 19:03.516
below my little bedroom
which was also my study.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.313
Because you had to be in
your college by 10 o'clock

19:05.314 --> 19:06.858
at night, and if you
didn't have permission

19:06.859 --> 19:09.698
to stay out later to
rehearse the play with,

19:09.699 --> 19:11.983
you had to climb over the gates.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.112
I was away from home when
I didn't have to have

19:14.113 --> 19:18.657
an ongoing relationship with
my father and my stepmother,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.410
who would occasionally
come and see the shows.

19:20.411 --> 19:24.913
So talking about my relationship with men

19:24.914 --> 19:26.915
was easy enough to avoid.

19:26.916 --> 19:31.211
The idea of being a
homosexual wasn't alien

19:31.212 --> 19:33.635
within theatre circles at university.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.468
So, when I fell in love and was attracted

19:38.469 --> 19:43.691
to one person more than any
other, it just seemed right.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.060
Some of the undergraduates
were doing a production

19:47.061 --> 19:51.272
of Caesar and Cleopatra, amongst
whom was Curt, Curt Dawson.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.447
It was innocent love on my
part, I think, and on his.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.280
The big advantage to me of Cambridge

19:57.281 --> 19:59.948
was that I'm joined in that ethos,

19:59.949 --> 20:02.575
that group, that mafia of young people

20:02.576 --> 20:06.413
who were determined and confident
and wanted to have a life

20:06.414 --> 20:07.290
in the theatre.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.963
The national newspapers would
come down and review us.

20:09.964 --> 20:14.003
Anyone studying drama, to be
reviewed by the Sunday Times

20:14.004 --> 20:16.381
or the Observer or the
Guardian or the Telegraph,

20:16.382 --> 20:17.554
what a gift that was.

20:17.555 --> 20:20.099
Your name became current.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.270
When I was starting out,
the parts I generally played

20:25.271 --> 20:27.976
were not people my own age,
but people in disguise.

20:27.977 --> 20:28.853
Old people.

20:28.854 --> 20:31.020
Extreme characters.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.316
I was playing Justice Shallow

20:32.317 --> 20:34.190
in Henry IV Part Two, an old man.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.239
And the headline was
Here's a brilliant Justice,

20:36.240 --> 20:37.452
but who is he?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.833
And then the piece then went on to say,

20:43.200 --> 20:44.417
I'd like to know this actor's name

20:44.418 --> 20:47.129
because it will obviously
become a name to remember.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.543
And when I read that, I decided

20:50.544 --> 20:52.839
to become a professional
actor, that was it.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.966
Your duty is to arrive in the theatre

20:59.967 --> 21:02.927
as absolutely physically fit

21:02.928 --> 21:07.348
and relaxed and alert as possible,

21:07.349 --> 21:10.190
having rested during the
day so that when you come

21:10.191 --> 21:11.779
onto the stage full of energy.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.492
At the peak of your abilities,
physical and mental.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.746
The people who have been
at work all day say,

21:20.747 --> 21:22.456
"How do they do it?"

21:23.574 --> 21:24.917
Well they do it because they
haven't been doing anything,

21:24.918 --> 21:26.659
but now they are.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.537
And you give your energy to the people

21:29.538 --> 21:31.666
who have been working all
day, who need some energy

21:31.667 --> 21:34.292
to revive their spirits for the next day.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.920
That's what acting is about.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.889
That's how you contribute to society.

21:42.384 --> 21:46.059
The impact of your performance
is not predominately facial,

21:47.223 --> 21:50.892
particularly if you're too
far back in the theatre.

21:50.893 --> 21:54.318
What becomes important is the
silhouette, the whole body.

21:56.982 --> 22:01.319
The way the character walks,
gesticulates, his voice,

22:01.320 --> 22:05.490
the whole body is the way,
probably, I'm going to get into

22:05.491 --> 22:08.206
feeling and believing
that I am the character.

22:08.207 --> 22:10.296
I walk differently in
every character I play

22:10.297 --> 22:15.509
because human beings do walk
differently, I've noticed.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.634
You could not act in the
professional theatre in London.

22:24.635 --> 22:25.602
You couldn't be on television.

22:25.603 --> 22:27.722
You couldn't be in a film
unless you were a member

22:27.723 --> 22:29.639
of British Actor's Equity.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.892
Well, what could you do?

22:34.562 --> 22:36.656
You went out of London to work.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.026
That's what we all did.

22:39.027 --> 22:41.197
And we learned how to act professionally.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.038
We learnt the rigours of the routines

22:44.039 --> 22:45.952
and the techniques and the attitudes.

22:48.117 --> 22:52.245
The romanticism of my
love for the theatre,

22:52.246 --> 22:55.790
it was indulged and satisfied.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.959
I had quickly moved into a flat.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.837
This new theatre had flats for the actors.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.630
We did modern plays that had come straight

23:02.631 --> 23:03.507
from the West End.

23:03.508 --> 23:06.885
We did reviews, we had
to sing, I had to dance.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.354
Did adaptations of Dickens.

23:08.355 --> 23:10.138
We did Shakespeare.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.306
Did Chekhov.

23:11.307 --> 23:14.851
Being befriended by actors
who had been working

23:14.852 --> 23:16.603
in the theatre for 20, 3O years

23:16.604 --> 23:18.481
and really knew what they were doing.

23:21.859 --> 23:26.195
Yes, I was in rep at Ipswich
and just got myself an agent.

23:26.196 --> 23:30.199
And she received a call from
the Nottingham playhouse

23:30.200 --> 23:31.951
which had just been built and asked me

23:31.952 --> 23:36.289
would I play, she thought, the
first citizen in Coriolanus,

23:36.290 --> 23:38.416
which Turin Guthrie was going to direct.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.964
Now, the first citizen
was quite a good part

23:39.965 --> 23:43.880
despite its anonymity, and unanonymity.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.259
And I went out there very
thrilled to be doing that,

23:46.260 --> 23:48.384
and we sat around for the
first day's rehearsal,

23:48.385 --> 23:50.011
which was going to be a
read-through of the play,

23:50.012 --> 23:52.060
and Guthrie, just before
that started, said,

23:52.061 --> 23:55.683
"Now, where is the Aufidius?"

23:55.684 --> 23:56.776
And everyone looked
around, including myself,

23:56.777 --> 23:58.728
and until the finger was pointed at me,

23:58.729 --> 24:00.151
and I was told that I was playing Aufidius

24:00.152 --> 24:03.399
and my agent had just
misheard over the phone,

24:03.400 --> 24:04.820
the first citizen, Aufidius.

24:04.821 --> 24:06.444
They have the same sort of rhythm.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.910
And I suddenly found
myself playing what was

24:08.911 --> 24:12.035
turned out to be practically,
well, the second leading part.

24:14.411 --> 24:18.086
At the end of Coriolanus,
when his rival and dear friend

24:18.087 --> 24:22.126
slaughters him, Aufidius
expresses his deep regret

24:22.127 --> 24:24.221
that he's killed his best friend.

24:26.548 --> 24:31.600
And that's normally played as ironic.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.139
And Guthrie said, "No, be truthful."

24:35.140 --> 24:36.685
"You killed him, you needed to kill him,"

24:36.686 --> 24:37.981
"you had to kill him, you couldn't"

24:37.982 --> 24:40.571
"stop yourself killing
him, and you do immediately"

24:41.647 --> 24:43.570
"see the other side of the situation."

24:43.571 --> 24:46.317
"So that's what you must feel."

24:46.318 --> 24:48.611
"You must turn on a sixpence."

24:48.612 --> 24:53.282
And he encouraged me to wail
deep, deep subtle grief.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.579
Cry that wasn't written by Shakespeare.

24:55.580 --> 24:58.538
It was a moment I dodged
in all the rehearsals.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.917
But I knew that I was going to
have to do it at some point,

25:00.918 --> 25:05.336
and at the dress rehearsal, I
tried to do it and couldn't.

25:05.337 --> 25:10.133
And Guthrie came down the aisle wrapped up

25:10.134 --> 25:12.176
in a scarf, he had a cold.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.396
And said, "lan, you have to do this."

25:14.397 --> 25:16.889
"You have to persuade the audience."

25:16.890 --> 25:20.565
"These are people who are
living at the extremes."

25:21.895 --> 25:23.609
"You have to be heartfelt and you have"

25:23.610 --> 25:26.324
"to be utterly committed
and let's do it again now."

25:27.860 --> 25:30.704
(dramatic music)

25:54.136 --> 25:56.054
And I did and found I could

25:56.055 --> 25:58.347
for the first time, perhaps ever,

25:58.348 --> 26:03.570
is to dare, risk, be carefree,

26:05.314 --> 26:07.237
to be unembarrassed,

26:07.483 --> 26:12.028
to be bold, not be shy, to know,
or at least take advantage,

26:12.029 --> 26:16.074
of the fact that in that
moment, you are in charge.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.410
However useless your
life outside might feel

26:19.411 --> 26:22.290
as that's happening, you're
doing Shakespeare's bidding

26:22.291 --> 26:27.511
as it were.

26:27.544 --> 26:31.756
And my dad came to see Coriolanus
and he met Turin Guthrie.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.260
And Guthrie said, "You must
be very proud of your son."

26:41.558 --> 26:44.152
Dad and Gladys, my stepmother,
came to the first night party

26:44.153 --> 26:45.270
in our flat.

26:46.814 --> 26:49.442
Dad sat on the floor, I
had never seen that before.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.112
Chatting up the actresses, I think.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.197
Well, they were all intrigued by him,

26:55.198 --> 26:57.281
he was an attractive man.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.283
Gladys thrilled to be with
some professional actors.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.833
She's adored them since she was a child.

27:06.708 --> 27:11.714
And three weeks later, he
had a stroke or something,

27:11.797 --> 27:17.019
a blackout driving the car
before the time of safety belts.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.053
The steering wheel caved in his chest

27:19.054 --> 27:20.476
and he died a day later.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.732
During my teenage years, I
was horrible to my father.

27:25.733 --> 27:27.603
I wouldn't talk to him.

27:27.604 --> 27:28.604
I just couldn't.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.606
I didn't know why.

27:32.609 --> 27:37.363
I saw only things that
I thought he did wrong.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.492
I didn't see his merits.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.838
No, I wasn't much of a son.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.590
Well, that's because I was a gay

27:50.591 --> 27:53.051
and if I had a girlfriend I was proud of

27:53.052 --> 27:55.798
and wanted to show off and
talk about getting engaged,

27:55.799 --> 27:57.517
of course I would have gone home.

28:01.638 --> 28:05.984
Well, I was in a play which
there was a coffin on the stage.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.857
And I went to the funeral
and I came back that evening

28:12.858 --> 28:13.858
and did the show.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.199
I don't think actors do it these days.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.121
I think if somebody close to you dies,

28:23.122 --> 28:24.410
then you take the day off.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.287
But we didn't then.

28:25.288 --> 28:27.460
The show must go on, you know?

28:34.421 --> 28:36.469
I must have tried to get into films.

28:36.470 --> 28:38.968
And yes, they didn't really want me.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.096
I went for an interview

28:42.097 --> 28:44.393
to play Noel Coward, just an interview.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.518
And somebody there said,

28:47.519 --> 28:50.519
"He's got the look of the young Noel."

28:50.520 --> 28:52.605
And I reported this to
my agents at the time

28:52.606 --> 28:54.072
who was rather pushy who said, "Right."

28:54.073 --> 28:56.285
"Get yourself some photographs
to take as Noel Coward."

28:56.286 --> 28:59.746
So back home, I asked a friend
to come and photograph me.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.412
Impressed by these
photographs, I was called in

29:02.413 --> 29:06.118
for a full day's screen audition.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.666
The man directing was
the screenplay writer.

29:08.667 --> 29:10.086
He said, "You've got the part."

29:10.087 --> 29:13.834
"Dan Massit did it
yesterday, but no, you nailed."

29:13.835 --> 29:16.629
Well, Dan Massit was Noel Coward's godson

29:16.630 --> 29:20.180
and I don't suppose my audition
was ever taken seriously.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.261
And then there was an offer to be

29:22.262 --> 29:25.356
in a film with Gregory Peck,
who was a big star at the time.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.683
And the <i>snows</i> arrived early that year

29:28.684 --> 29:30.436
and the whole thing was abandoned.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.315
So this young actor
thought fuck it, really.

29:34.316 --> 29:36.235
If that's the way films are done,

29:36.236 --> 29:38.361
I don't want anything to do with them.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.533
So I threw myself into the theatre again.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.700
Maggie Smith, then at the National Theatre

29:45.701 --> 29:48.873
as a young actress, came to
see her friend Phyllis Calbert,

29:48.874 --> 29:51.293
spied me and reported
back to Laurence Olivier

29:51.294 --> 29:55.084
who was running the Old
Vic <i>as</i> the National Theatre

29:55.085 --> 29:57.300
and said, "if you're looking for a Claudio"

29:57.301 --> 29:59.390
"in Much Ado About
Nothing, I think he's done,"

29:59.391 --> 30:02.091
"they're mending a bicycle onstage."

30:02.092 --> 30:05.511
I thought, this is big,
big international stuff.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.641
This was the most famous
theatre troupe in the world.

30:13.353 --> 30:17.315
I was employed to start off
by playing the young hero

30:17.316 --> 30:21.402
in Much Ado About Nothing,
which starred young Maggie Smith

30:21.403 --> 30:24.031
and her, I think, then
husband Robert Stephens.

30:25.324 --> 30:29.076
Albert Finney was playing
Don Pedro, the next lead.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.795
And I was sort of just below that.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.415
So I felt rather overwhelmed.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.798
Don't think I said more
than 10 words to Maggie

30:36.799 --> 30:40.138
and they a few minutes when
we were doing the play,

30:40.139 --> 30:42.381
I'd felt very much out of it,

30:42.382 --> 30:46.510
although my old friends
from Cambridge days was

30:46.511 --> 30:49.765
in the company playing
the villain, Derek Jacobi.

30:50.766 --> 30:54.566
I couldn't keep my eyes off
Finney when we were rehearsing.

30:55.937 --> 31:00.066
And he was absolutely <i>as</i>
charismatic offstage as he was on.

31:00.067 --> 31:03.110
But again, I couldn't
feel I could befriend

31:03.111 --> 31:07.082
such an iconic young man.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.702
I didn't much enjoy doing it.

31:09.703 --> 31:11.540
I was very nervous all the time.

31:11.541 --> 31:13.957
And looking around me at
all the other young men

31:13.958 --> 31:15.795
who were in the company at the National,

31:15.796 --> 31:18.669
I thought if I'm going to
stay with this company,

31:18.670 --> 31:21.672
it's going to be a long
time before I get to play

31:21.673 --> 31:24.140
parts in which I can really make my mark.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.052
So I left.

31:29.304 --> 31:33.140
And Olivier wrote a letter
with typical florid language

31:33.141 --> 31:36.896
saying he was haunted by the
spectre of lost opportunity.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.571
I got this offer to go and
do a newly formed company

31:41.572 --> 31:44.235
called Prospect, it was Richard ll.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.954
And when that was a success,

31:45.955 --> 31:49.240
we revived it for the
1969 Edinburgh festival.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.950
And accompanied it

31:50.951 --> 31:53.124
with Christopher Marlowe's play Edward ll.

31:54.037 --> 31:54.913
It was a big production.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.748
It was 2O actors or more in the company.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.968
Simple sets, because they had to tour.

31:59.969 --> 32:02.545
There wasn't much money for anybody.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.588
My name's Ian McKellen.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.341
I'm a 3O year old actor
earning 50 pounds a week

32:07.342 --> 32:10.892
playing Richard II in a play
by Shakespeare and Edward ll

32:10.893 --> 32:14.807
in a play by Marlowe, at
the end of a 12 week tour

32:14.808 --> 32:16.434
of theatres in Britain.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.985
(dramatic trumpet music)

32:26.486 --> 32:29.572
Alack, why am I sent for to a king

32:29.573 --> 32:31.991
before I have shook off the regal thoughts

32:31.992 --> 32:32.914
wherewith I reigned?

32:32.915 --> 32:35.661
I hardly yet have learned to insinuate,

32:35.662 --> 32:38.497
flatter, bow, and bend the knee.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.752
Give sorrow leave a while to
tutor me to this submission.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.922
And yet I will remember
the favours of these men.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.049
Were they not mine?

32:50.427 --> 32:53.055
Did they not sometime cry all hail to me?

32:53.056 --> 32:54.931
So Judas did to Christ,

32:56.433 --> 32:59.518
yet he and 12 found truth in all but one.

32:59.519 --> 33:03.399
I in 12,000, none.

33:06.276 --> 33:08.825
My swelling heart for very anger breaks.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.034
How oft have I been baited by these peers

33:12.035 --> 33:14.626
and dare not be revenged
for their power is great.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.914
But shall the crowing of these
cockerels affright a lion?

33:19.915 --> 33:24.627
Edward, unfold thy paws,
and let their lives' blood

33:24.628 --> 33:26.676
slake thy fury's hunger.

33:28.298 --> 33:33.020
If I be cruel and grow tyrannous,

33:36.515 --> 33:40.986
now let them thank
themselves and rue too late.

33:41.895 --> 33:42.771
[Ian] For me to be able

33:42.772 --> 33:45.940
to play two absolutely massive parts,

33:45.941 --> 33:48.901
established me as an actor in every sense.

33:48.902 --> 33:52.112
Sweet Spencer, we adopt thee here.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.864
And merely of our love,

33:53.865 --> 33:56.118
we do create thee Earl of Gloucester.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.459
[Ian] I was the leading,
young leading man.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.212
I got the pick of the parts.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.213
You know.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.891
Although I wasn't really aware of it,

34:14.891 --> 34:17.560
I suppose I had become a young star.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.856
(upbeat music)

34:27.440 --> 34:28.690
- Ian McKellen.
- Ian McKellen.

34:30.443 --> 34:33.070
- British actor Ian McKellen.
- I think he's going to be

34:33.071 --> 34:34.414
a very important star.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.203
[Woman] One of his
country's best actors.

34:37.204 --> 34:39.328
[Man] A man said to be
the leading classical actor

34:39.329 --> 34:41.161
of his generation.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.960
[Reporter] McKellen could
earn considerably more

34:42.960 --> 34:46.833
by staying permanently in
London or going into films.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.085
But he prefers to go out on tour.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.302
I can't go through the stage door,

34:51.303 --> 34:54.347
which is where the actors
and other theatre workers go

34:56.386 --> 34:59.310
of any theatre anywhere
without being excited.

35:01.141 --> 35:04.518
Because there, I'm in this secret world

35:04.519 --> 35:06.738
that the public know nothing about.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.775
I relished, as a young man,

35:09.776 --> 35:13.620
being able to fill those
theatres and reach people.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.447
The audience could forget where they were

35:16.448 --> 35:18.744
and just concentrate on the relationship

35:18.745 --> 35:19.789
that we were having.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.997
I felt that I could almost touch them,

35:24.998 --> 35:26.671
at least I could with my voice.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.801
My professional life is
devoted to strangers.

35:32.802 --> 35:35.266
I'm in the company of
strangers all day long.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.468
They're potential friends.

35:37.469 --> 35:40.721
I mean, I've had two or three stalkers

35:40.722 --> 35:42.099
for want of a better word.

35:42.100 --> 35:46.268
A young lady who I had met
at a stage door no more

35:46.269 --> 35:50.445
than that, came into a rehearsal
room when I was in London,

35:51.358 --> 35:54.735
picked up a glass ashtray, and broke it

35:54.736 --> 35:59.742
against the metal heater,
and slashed her wrists,

35:59.783 --> 36:05.005
to what, get my attention
or convey her misery

36:05.038 --> 36:06.836
with which she associated me.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.420
You can't really complain
when you spend your life,

36:11.421 --> 36:14.548
professionally, trying
to affect people's lives

36:14.549 --> 36:16.799
and their thoughts and their emotions.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.385
It's what you've been trying to do.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.980
You've been trying to get
involved in their lives.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.108
To act for a long run in London

36:30.730 --> 36:32.071
doesn't hold that much appeal to me.

36:32.072 --> 36:33.282
It seems to me that the West End

36:33.283 --> 36:36.235
is mainly a tourist theatre.

36:36.236 --> 36:38.284
One doesn't really feel
that one's contributing much

36:38.285 --> 36:41.740
to society in general from his acting

36:41.741 --> 36:43.334
to a lot of people who
are just on holiday.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.498
When you come to Leeds, when
you play to packed houses,

36:46.499 --> 36:48.247
you feel that for that week at least,

36:48.248 --> 36:49.962
you've set up your tent like a circus

36:49.963 --> 36:52.505
and you've made some
sort of impact on people

36:52.506 --> 36:54.091
who won't forget you and their lives

36:54.092 --> 36:57.216
might just have been changed a
little bit by the experience.

36:59.342 --> 37:02.761
The Actors Company was an idea that Edward

37:02.762 --> 37:04.513
and I had had together and we began

37:04.514 --> 37:07.349
by inviting some friends who, like us,

37:07.350 --> 37:11.645
perhaps had been with the
big national companies.

37:11.646 --> 37:15.025
Felt a bit remote from how
the organisation happened,

37:15.026 --> 37:17.484
and had been keen to organise themselves.

37:17.485 --> 37:18.361
If the play was going to be a success,

37:18.362 --> 37:21.490
it would be because the actors
were working well together

37:21.491 --> 37:23.198
with the director.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.413
It's a subtle change.

37:24.414 --> 37:26.787
Normally, a director will choose the cast.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.748
In this case, the cast chose the director.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.750
I was touring.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.960
I wasn't London-centric.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.429
It was very, very hard work.

37:36.430 --> 37:39.465
But it revolutionised the abilities I had

37:39.466 --> 37:41.925
to present my case at a meeting.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.845
I've never had to do that before, really.

37:44.846 --> 37:48.432
Well, that changed my life absolutely.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.726
It was something I had initiated.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.775
It seemed easy because
it was based on things

37:52.776 --> 37:55.147
I absolutely believed in the idea

37:55.148 --> 37:58.317
that it was only a group
of like-minded people

37:58.318 --> 38:01.741
working closest together could
put on the best productions.

38:01.742 --> 38:03.786
Well, you can imagine
the sort of confidence

38:03.787 --> 38:06.575
that we all had that this was ours.

38:06.576 --> 38:07.828
It was us.

38:13.208 --> 38:17.714
My sense of inadequacy and
discomfort and uncertainty.

38:20.048 --> 38:23.801
I felt strongly before
I came out, I think.

38:23.802 --> 38:28.180
I related directly towards
the first 49 years of my life,

38:28.181 --> 38:31.060
having on occasion to
pretend to be something

38:31.061 --> 38:33.903
other than I was or not
be honest about myself.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.482
I was absolutely not
confident in being butch

38:38.483 --> 38:41.568
or over-masculine and
that's probably to do

38:41.569 --> 38:45.072
with the fact that I was
different and not interested

38:45.073 --> 38:49.374
in women, which these sort of
characters were, I suppose.

38:51.913 --> 38:57.135
When I look back at TV
stuff that I did early on,

38:58.920 --> 39:03.221
or film, I am not impressed at all.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.064
I'm a great believer
in family, you know.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.469
Inheriting things and all that.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.346
Oh really?

39:08.347 --> 39:09.721
Oh yes indeed, it's
amazing what gets passed on

39:09.722 --> 39:10.644
from father to son.

39:10.645 --> 39:12.474
And I don't just mean appearances either.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.317
Gracious.

39:13.318 --> 39:15.152
Liable to think not so bad on any terms.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.192
I can't bear it, and I won't.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.314
I've loved you every minute day and night

39:19.315 --> 39:20.235
since I first met you.

39:20.236 --> 39:21.699
Oh, doubt that the stars are on fire.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.660
Doubt that the sun's...

39:22.661 --> 39:25.070
Get off me. (Dog whimpering)

39:25.071 --> 39:27.114
I'm asking you to be my wife, Dora.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.742
If you love me even 1/10
as much <i>as</i> I love you,

39:28.743 --> 39:29.788
you can't refuse me.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.536
Dora, say you'll be mine.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.584
Say yes, Dora.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.257
[Ian] And it's when we
did Macbeth in a very,

39:36.258 --> 39:38.170
very small theatre at Stratford,

39:38.171 --> 39:40.511
the other place with only a hundred people

39:40.512 --> 39:44.840
scattered around the
stage, I realised that

39:44.841 --> 39:48.220
that was the size of
theatre I most enjoyed.

39:49.888 --> 39:54.266
That discovery in 1976 began to fit me

39:54.267 --> 39:56.565
for television and the cinema.

39:58.563 --> 40:02.941
A handle toward my hand.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.660
Come, let me touch thee.

40:07.196 --> 40:10.824
Have thee not.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.993
And yet I see thee still.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.995
Art thou not a fatal vision,

40:14.996 --> 40:17.664
sensible to feeling <i>as</i> to sight?

40:17.665 --> 40:20.963
Or art thou but a dagger of
the mind, a false creation,

40:20.964 --> 40:23.088
proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?

40:24.005 --> 40:27.925
[Ian] That way of doing
Shakespeare is now the model

40:27.926 --> 40:30.020
for many people, that Shakespeare belongs

40:30.021 --> 40:34.431
in very small theatres
where you're witnessing

40:34.432 --> 40:39.654
the dissection of a man's
mind and imagination.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.192
Who lies in the second chamber?

40:45.193 --> 40:47.069
Donalbain.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.196
This is a sorry sight.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.870
[Ian] And in a small theatre,

40:50.871 --> 40:56.087
that's claustrophobically overwhelming,

40:56.454 --> 40:59.831
where every detail is
available to everybody.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.584
Thy bones are marrowless,
thy blood is cold.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.878
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes

41:04.879 --> 41:05.755
which thou dost glare with.

41:05.756 --> 41:10.133
I was able to just be, exists, alert

41:10.134 --> 41:11.807
to the fact that it was a performance,

41:11.808 --> 41:14.930
but relaxed in the
moment, making it fresh,

41:14.931 --> 41:17.150
and doing it just for these people now

41:17.151 --> 41:21.061
whose eyes I could actually look into

41:21.062 --> 41:23.397
as I was speaking if necessary.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.821
And that which should accompany old age.

41:25.822 --> 41:31.039
As honour, love, obedience,
troops of friends.

41:35.702 --> 41:39.621
I was part of what's now
looked back at <i>as</i> a golden era

41:39.622 --> 41:41.090
of the arts, see?

41:42.834 --> 41:45.963
A lifelong friendship with
Judi Dench resulted from it.

41:45.964 --> 41:47.384
I loved working with her.

41:48.256 --> 41:51.178
She's not an easy actress
to work with in one sense

41:51.179 --> 41:53.515
in that the audience are
all in love with her.

41:53.516 --> 41:56.310
You feel rather cut out when
you're onstage with her.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.980
Now, Judi can always be relied
onto give you a good time,

41:59.981 --> 42:04.646
and she's, I think, would
much rather be playing games,

42:04.647 --> 42:05.981
silly games.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.575
If she decides that we gotta do something,

42:07.576 --> 42:09.151
then we all do it.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.325
To enliven a matinee performance,

42:11.326 --> 42:16.199
she said she distributed
little red sticking circles

42:16.200 --> 42:18.623
that you might put on a Post-it board.

42:19.579 --> 42:22.873
And we were each of us
required to wear one

42:22.874 --> 42:26.626
of these red dots about our costume.

42:26.627 --> 42:29.046
And at the end of the performance,

42:29.047 --> 42:31.590
you would tell the group leader Judi

42:31.591 --> 42:35.052
how many red spots you'd spotted.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.220
(chuckling)

42:37.221 --> 42:40.140
John Woodvine playing Banquo knelt down

42:40.141 --> 42:42.519
to me as king and everyone else was able

42:42.520 --> 42:46.438
to observe that he got his
other sole of his shoe.

42:46.439 --> 42:49.941
When we all saw it, we all laughed.

42:49.942 --> 42:50.943
Outrageous.

42:52.612 --> 42:53.488
Of course, the tricky bit

42:53.489 --> 42:56.367
is not to let the audience
know you're laughing.

42:56.368 --> 42:58.241
Dear oh dear oh dear.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.165
We get away with so much, actors.

43:00.166 --> 43:03.413
I mean, the childishness of let's pretend,

43:03.414 --> 43:06.167
let's make-believe, bang, you're dead.

43:07.168 --> 43:11.004
We get to behave a way in
which real adults don't do

43:11.005 --> 43:12.964
and we're allowed to do it.

43:12.965 --> 43:15.388
And thank goodness, because it's fun.

43:16.511 --> 43:17.603
I love laughing.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.143
Don't do it that often.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.147
Not many things make me laugh,

43:23.148 --> 43:25.486
but Sean Mathias makes me
laugh, and our relationship,

43:25.487 --> 43:28.271
which began when we met as actors

43:28.272 --> 43:32.567
at the Edinburgh festival
in 1978, I remember

43:32.568 --> 43:34.032
the first evening we spent together.

43:34.033 --> 43:35.496
What we were laughing about.

43:42.537 --> 43:45.372
(chuckling)

43:45.373 --> 43:47.165
(upbeat music)

43:47.166 --> 43:49.419
If you play the leading part
in a hit show on Broadway,

43:49.420 --> 43:52.921
there are few more alluring
prospects for an actor.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.636
Everybody knows who you are.

43:54.637 --> 43:56.760
Everybody thinks you're marvellous.

43:56.761 --> 43:58.552
It's a theatre town.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.306
If you make it there, you'll
make it anywhere, you know.

44:01.307 --> 44:02.894
So it was terribly, terribly exciting.

44:02.895 --> 44:06.268
And the centre of New York
was rather a wild place.

44:06.269 --> 44:08.859
There are no distractions
of national politics

44:08.860 --> 44:10.857
in New York as there are in London.

44:11.983 --> 44:16.153
The main industry,
really, supporting tourism

44:16.154 --> 44:17.622
is the theatre, is Broadway.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.699
And you're the top of the heap.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.741
Ian McKellen.

44:21.742 --> 44:24.086
(applause)

44:35.840 --> 44:37.934
My god, you're mixing with presidents.

44:37.935 --> 44:42.931
Almost every night, some
local celebrity would drop by.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.391
Barbra Streisand arriving

44:44.392 --> 44:46.392
in the dressing room with Noel Coward.

44:47.310 --> 44:48.727
And I found myself introducing them

44:48.728 --> 44:50.230
to the other person in the dressing room.

44:50.231 --> 44:54.608
Do you know Rudolf Nureyev,
who was the most famous dancer

44:54.609 --> 44:55.485
at the time.

44:55.486 --> 44:57.907
Rudy may have flirted
with me a little bit.

44:57.908 --> 45:00.614
I don't think I really noticed.

45:00.615 --> 45:02.583
My name in lights for the first time.

45:02.584 --> 45:04.159
Whoa.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.003
It actually isn't that big a deal.

45:06.004 --> 45:07.996
But you say to yourself,

45:07.997 --> 45:11.672
oh I see, I've had my name in lights.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.509
Winning the Tony at the end of that year,

45:16.510 --> 45:20.467
it remains a confirmation
that that was work well done.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.721
I think perhaps of all my
awards that that's the one

45:22.722 --> 45:26.725
that means something to
me, because it sums up

45:28.142 --> 45:29.564
what the year was like, number one.

45:29.565 --> 45:31.779
And when Sean and I fell in love,

45:32.813 --> 45:35.362
it seemed better for us
to start our relationship

45:35.363 --> 45:38.360
of a formal nature by living in a place

45:38.361 --> 45:39.829
that neither of us had lived in before.

45:39.830 --> 45:41.163
So it became ours.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.786
Well, he's been a huge
influence on my life.

45:44.787 --> 45:47.499
A director who's also a very close friend

45:47.500 --> 45:50.123
and who knows more about
me than anybody else.

45:50.124 --> 45:55.128
And who loves me in a way that
he won't let me do anything

45:55.294 --> 45:57.513
that is less than my best.

45:59.423 --> 46:02.393
My biggest weakness of an
actor, don't tell anybody,

46:02.394 --> 46:05.971
is if there's a scene of high emotion,

46:05.972 --> 46:10.398
when a character's out of
control of his emotions,

46:11.352 --> 46:14.697
you have to totally commit
to that and in the moment

46:14.698 --> 46:17.315
delve into things that you perhaps

46:17.316 --> 46:18.909
don't know about yourself.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.324
And I found that difficult.

46:22.321 --> 46:26.952
What I can't get to grips with
is the essence of the man.

46:32.206 --> 46:35.961
And so I'm having to go back
rather in these late stages

46:35.962 --> 46:41.182
of rehearsal to absolute
basics of what the man is.

46:42.091 --> 46:47.313
What do his attitudes spring from?

46:52.351 --> 46:55.854
An Englishman's home in his
castle is quite a good summary.

46:55.855 --> 46:57.856
But it does mean, yeah,

46:57.857 --> 46:59.859
you don't interfere with other people.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.240
You have relationships with them,

47:02.241 --> 47:06.116
of course, you fall in love
with them, you live with them,

47:06.117 --> 47:10.452
but beyond that network, you
don't bother other people.

47:10.453 --> 47:12.417
Let them do what they want to do.

47:12.418 --> 47:14.131
Well, that is wonderful isn't it?

47:15.124 --> 47:18.293
But if it means that it inhibits you

47:18.294 --> 47:20.258
and that you don't express yourself

47:20.259 --> 47:23.757
and you don't risk and you
don't stand up for yourself,

47:23.758 --> 47:24.850
then that's not good.

47:25.801 --> 47:27.144
[Max] I kind of pity him.

47:27.145 --> 47:29.471
[Prisoner] Germagnus Hershfield?

47:29.472 --> 47:31.723
Oh yes, yes, I remember him.

47:31.724 --> 47:33.475
- Berlin.
- Berlin.

47:33.476 --> 47:34.318
He wanted to...

47:34.319 --> 47:35.894
Make queers legal.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.520
Yes, I remember.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.819
People who saw Bent,
Martin Sherman's play

47:39.820 --> 47:42.659
about the ill treatment of gay people

47:43.611 --> 47:46.490
in the labour camps of the
Third Reich in the 1930s

47:47.656 --> 47:50.125
couldn't help applauding every night.

47:52.953 --> 47:55.502
When I was interviewed about it I said,

47:56.374 --> 48:00.675
"Oh, this was a play about
civil rights and humanity."

48:03.547 --> 48:06.383
I couldn't bring myself to say it was

48:06.384 --> 48:10.345
about the gay experience,
which it self-evidently is.

48:10.346 --> 48:12.474
I'm not suddenly turning
political, as it were.

48:12.475 --> 48:15.477
I'm not doing this play
because it says something

48:15.478 --> 48:16.898
that I passionately believe in.

48:16.899 --> 48:20.897
I'm afraid behaving as
a rather amoral actor

48:20.898 --> 48:23.608
who's seen a very good
part in a very good play.

48:23.609 --> 48:24.485
[Interviewer] One of
the methods of the play

48:24.486 --> 48:27.112
is the change that overtakes
your character Max, isn't it?

48:27.113 --> 48:30.037
Who, initially, is more
concerned with survival,

48:30.038 --> 48:32.909
later in the play does protest

48:32.910 --> 48:35.495
and declare his homosexuality.

48:35.496 --> 48:37.497
I mean, is that an important
aspect of the character

48:37.498 --> 48:39.375
to you, in something about the play?

48:40.292 --> 48:43.211
You know, all great parts in good plays

48:43.212 --> 48:47.340
are charting of a journey.

48:47.341 --> 48:50.185
If Martin were to claim
that it's mainly a play

48:50.186 --> 48:52.971
for homosexuals, about homosexuality,

48:52.972 --> 48:54.770
he would be denigrating his play.

48:54.771 --> 48:57.434
And that's not the case, I don't think.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.654
What woke me up was AIDS.

49:01.355 --> 49:02.652
[News Anchor] The
sports council for Wales

49:02.653 --> 49:04.399
decided to fire the AIDS carriers

49:04.400 --> 49:06.321
from this pool and the
National Sports Centre...

49:06.322 --> 49:07.194
[Woman Anchor] Firemen too were worried

49:07.194 --> 49:08.161
about the dangers.

49:08.162 --> 49:11.078
They fear they could
contract AIDS in accidents

49:11.079 --> 49:13.450
from infected blood or from saliva

49:13.451 --> 49:14.998
when giving the kiss of life.

49:16.203 --> 49:17.667
[Reporter] 4,000 doomed to die

49:17.668 --> 49:19.961
from AIDS over the next three years.

49:19.962 --> 49:23.712
AIDS was the big,
big issue of the 1980s.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.045
(sighing)

49:26.046 --> 49:27.172
It was a killer.

49:28.132 --> 49:29.679
It was a worldwide killer.

49:31.010 --> 49:32.603
And it killed some of my friends,

49:32.604 --> 49:34.893
including my first boyfriend Curt.

49:36.765 --> 49:40.685
And those of us lucky
enough not to have the virus

49:40.686 --> 49:43.940
which led onto the disease
which led on automatically

49:43.941 --> 49:47.942
to death, seeing friends dying around us,

49:47.943 --> 49:49.194
felt we had to do something.

49:49.195 --> 49:53.072
And one thing I could do was
raise money for this centre

49:53.073 --> 49:55.701
that was being built called
the London Lighthouse.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.459
And they needed funds badly

49:59.460 --> 50:01.583
because they were
renovating an old school.

50:01.584 --> 50:04.047
And having just been
doing my one man show act

50:04.048 --> 50:07.047
of Shakespeare in America,
I thought if I put that on

50:07.048 --> 50:10.300
in London and don't charge
for it, we could make a lot

50:10.301 --> 50:13.018
of money quite quickly,
which is what was needed.

50:13.019 --> 50:17.263
The money from the box
office would go the next day

50:17.264 --> 50:19.435
to the site where it would pay the workers

50:19.436 --> 50:21.351
who were opening up this building.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.696
And I would go into the audience
with my bucket at the end

50:23.697 --> 50:26.105
and get further contributions.

50:26.106 --> 50:28.402
Carol Waters said could she have a word

50:28.403 --> 50:30.527
and as I was collecting money she said

50:30.528 --> 50:32.278
didn't I know anything about Section 28?

50:32.279 --> 50:33.246
And I didn't.

50:33.247 --> 50:36.036
But she gave me some literature
and I came back home here

50:36.037 --> 50:38.627
and read it and immediately
called her up and said,

50:38.628 --> 50:40.495
"What can I do to help?"

50:40.496 --> 50:45.718
Now, Section 28 was a
mean-spirited little law

50:46.168 --> 50:47.757
brought in <i>as</i> a private members bill

50:47.758 --> 50:49.549
but adopted by the
conservative government.

50:49.550 --> 50:51.049
Children who need to be taught

50:51.050 --> 50:55.051
to respect traditional moral
values are being taught

50:55.052 --> 50:59.097
that they have an
inalienable right to be gay.

50:59.098 --> 51:02.016
All of those children are being cheated

51:02.017 --> 51:04.269
of a sound start in life.

51:04.270 --> 51:05.895
Yes, cheated.

51:05.896 --> 51:08.111
Which said that a local authority

51:08.112 --> 51:10.155
could not promote homosexuality.

51:12.111 --> 51:15.490
An odd phrase, 'cause you
can't promote sexuality.

51:15.491 --> 51:17.742
But they meant it was a
topic that should go on

51:17.743 --> 51:21.541
not being talked about, and
certainly not in schools.

51:22.580 --> 51:27.802
Suddenly, I identified myself,
before everything else,

51:31.505 --> 51:35.305
as a gay man, and cared
about other gay men.

51:39.013 --> 51:41.232
Arguing the case against Section 28,

51:41.233 --> 51:44.934
I came out on a BBC discussion programme.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.731
[Interviewer] So, you would
just like to see Clause 28

51:46.732 --> 51:47.694
disappear altogether?

51:47.695 --> 51:48.905
Oh yes, I certainly would, yes.

51:48.906 --> 51:51.608
I think it's offensive to anyone who is,

51:51.609 --> 51:53.234
like myself, homosexual.

51:53.235 --> 51:56.446
Apart from the whole business of what can

51:56.447 --> 51:58.740
and cannot be taught to children.

51:58.741 --> 52:00.664
The programme would not be
broadcast for another two days

52:00.665 --> 52:02.661
and I had two days to tell people.

52:05.831 --> 52:07.582
They were all hugely supportive.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.003
Said they'd known for many years.

52:09.004 --> 52:11.628
And how glad they were
that I felt able now

52:11.629 --> 52:12.846
to be honest about it.

52:13.881 --> 52:19.103
The image I've often used is
of the removal of a weight

52:19.762 --> 52:21.856
on my shoulders that I
didn't realise was there.

52:21.857 --> 52:23.473
And it fell off.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.308
Immediately.

52:25.309 --> 52:28.353
I felt physically healthier.

52:28.354 --> 52:32.357
And the shyness which
I had felt all my life

52:32.358 --> 52:35.237
because I was hiding
the fact that I was gay,

52:35.238 --> 52:37.445
found it difficult to talk about,

52:37.446 --> 52:39.540
I could now walk in a room and be proud.

52:40.616 --> 52:42.492
I found myself in the
company of other people

52:42.493 --> 52:45.370
who wanted to make sure that that law

52:45.371 --> 52:47.248
or something like it
could never happen again,

52:47.249 --> 52:49.374
because the law was passed
and the law was changed

52:49.375 --> 52:50.797
and we did have Section 28.

52:51.669 --> 52:55.094
A new law which was clearly anti-gay.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.476
I've not been angry about
many things in my life,

52:59.477 --> 53:01.719
but I got angry about that.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.849
And it was a fruitful
act because it was a spur

53:06.642 --> 53:09.602
to use my methods of communication

53:09.603 --> 53:14.780
and my ability to communicate and my fame.

53:16.694 --> 53:21.791
Clause 28 is in part designed
to keep us in our place.

53:22.658 --> 53:24.080
But it didn't work with me.

53:25.452 --> 53:26.666
Well do what you can, I think.

53:26.667 --> 53:29.709
If you want to join a
group, go and join a group.

53:29.710 --> 53:31.624
If there's anything
you can do on your own,

53:31.625 --> 53:32.501
do it on your own.

53:32.502 --> 53:34.043
Do whatever you can.

53:34.044 --> 53:36.591
And in doing that, come
out, whether you're gay,

53:36.592 --> 53:39.090
lesbian, or straight, that doesn't matter.

53:39.091 --> 53:41.592
We all have to come
out against Section 28.

53:41.593 --> 53:43.766
If you have to abseil into
the House of Lords, do that.

53:43.767 --> 53:46.889
But it's the whole spectrum of our society

53:46.890 --> 53:48.891
which is affected by it,
because gays and lesbians

53:48.892 --> 53:51.736
are everywhere and they must
be seen to be everywhere.

53:51.737 --> 53:55.356
Being vocal, being
sensible, being indignant.

53:55.357 --> 53:57.400
And if you can do it with
a smile in your heart,

53:57.401 --> 53:58.493
we'll get there quicker, I think.

53:58.494 --> 54:02.238
And I went to other friends
like Michael Cashwin,

54:02.239 --> 54:04.949
an actor who had come out
about the same time <i>as</i> I did

54:04.950 --> 54:05.950
over Section 28.

54:06.827 --> 54:09.499
And he'd had the same
idea that there should be

54:09.500 --> 54:12.081
an organisation to
prevent anything happening

54:12.082 --> 54:12.958
like this again.

54:12.959 --> 54:14.050
There should be a permanent lobby.

54:14.051 --> 54:17.211
It should be a professional lobby.

54:17.212 --> 54:18.212
It should be paid for.

54:18.213 --> 54:20.807
Money could be raised to make it happen.

54:22.134 --> 54:25.183
And through that lobby, we
would educate the public

54:26.054 --> 54:29.649
at a time when the press
didn't talk about gays.

54:31.185 --> 54:32.482
Certainly not positively.

54:33.353 --> 54:36.072
So early on in setting up Stonewall,

54:37.357 --> 54:40.655
it was a group, and it was
10 lesbians and 10 gay men

54:40.656 --> 54:43.326
who eventually came
together, gender parity.

54:43.327 --> 54:44.906
Founded on principle.

54:44.907 --> 54:47.122
And here I was, now in a committee

54:47.123 --> 54:48.619
hoping to make things happen.

54:50.204 --> 54:52.914
It felt like the Actors Company again.

54:52.915 --> 54:54.417
We were all on the same side.

54:56.168 --> 54:58.132
And then I gave up an awful lot of time

54:58.133 --> 55:01.302
helping to start Stonewall
and imagining how it might be

55:01.303 --> 55:03.266
and raising funds, principle.

55:07.805 --> 55:10.431
My contribution wasn't much.

55:10.432 --> 55:11.896
I didn't understand the law.

55:11.897 --> 55:14.644
I didn't understand how
to manipulate the press,

55:14.645 --> 55:16.521
which you have to do.

55:16.522 --> 55:18.445
[Reporter] Sir Ian
McKellen's visit to Number 10

55:18.446 --> 55:20.608
is believed to be the
first time a prime minister

55:20.609 --> 55:22.202
has had an official meeting with an actor

55:22.203 --> 55:24.320
that is for homosexual rights.

55:24.321 --> 55:28.292
I directed and devised The Equality Show

55:29.409 --> 55:34.631
with Elton John and Sting
performed together for us

55:35.833 --> 55:38.042
at the Albert Hall for free.

55:38.043 --> 55:40.878
Raising funds for Stonewall, awareness

55:40.879 --> 55:42.973
about the presence of gay people,

55:42.974 --> 55:47.009
suddenly the subject matter of being gay

55:47.010 --> 55:49.720
was in the public domain.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.725
In Britain, it is lawful
for men and women to have sex

55:52.726 --> 55:55.648
at 60, but men can't
have sex with other men

55:55.649 --> 55:56.811
until they're 21.

55:56.812 --> 55:59.861
This, say homosexual pressure
groups, is an anomaly,

55:59.862 --> 56:03.067
and it's time to equalise
the age of consent.

56:03.068 --> 56:04.615
I think the majority
of people in Britain

56:04.616 --> 56:08.489
don't want this to become
a more homosexual society.

56:08.490 --> 56:10.536
There has been a campaign for a long time

56:10.537 --> 56:13.538
to try to make homosexuality
perfectly acceptable

56:13.539 --> 56:14.704
within society.

56:14.705 --> 56:15.955
We have it in the media.

56:15.956 --> 56:17.173
We have it with prominent people

56:17.174 --> 56:18.633
like yourself coming forward.

56:18.634 --> 56:20.960
I don't think it is succeeding.

56:20.961 --> 56:23.713
That is to say, I don't think
that the majority of people.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.894
We don't want to go down the line

56:28.895 --> 56:32.305
of having more homosexuality

56:32.306 --> 56:35.397
because young people are
particularly vulnerable.

56:35.398 --> 56:37.736
The majority of people
are still very strongly

56:37.737 --> 56:40.479
opposed to spreading homosexuality,

56:40.480 --> 56:44.609
that they're not in favour
of persecuting homosexuals.

56:44.610 --> 56:46.237
Well, you're repeating yourself.

56:46.238 --> 56:48.580
And again, it's the view of the majority

56:48.581 --> 56:52.742
against a minority and I don't approve it.

56:52.743 --> 56:56.162
But do please read the BMA report.

56:56.163 --> 57:00.082
And your idea that somehow
people of 16 and 17

57:00.083 --> 57:02.627
are vulnerable, was that your word?

57:02.628 --> 57:04.505
Undecided about their sexuality.

57:04.506 --> 57:06.631
No, sexuality is fixed.

57:06.632 --> 57:09.226
Everyone agrees, which is why
the BMA has changed its mind,

57:09.227 --> 57:10.843
before puberty.

57:10.844 --> 57:12.517
Now that's not to say that young people

57:12.518 --> 57:15.222
are not confused about their sexuality,

57:15.223 --> 57:17.442
and no wonder when they
hear, with respect,

57:19.686 --> 57:20.937
About it, and didn't walk about

57:20.938 --> 57:23.441
in the streets protesting
that they were gay.

57:23.442 --> 57:26.406
You know, it took me 49 years
to be honest about myself.

57:26.407 --> 57:28.824
And your arguments seem to be in favour

57:28.825 --> 57:32.573
of people being gay but
not talking about it.

57:32.574 --> 57:35.164
Let's keep it to themselves
and don't spread it.

57:35.165 --> 57:36.412
No one wants to spread it.

57:36.413 --> 57:37.954
It exists in society.

57:37.955 --> 57:39.080
Always has, always will.

57:39.081 --> 57:42.085
It takes two heterosexuals
to make a homosexual.

57:42.086 --> 57:43.176
And so it carries on.

57:43.177 --> 57:45.336
Why not just be at ease with it?

57:45.337 --> 57:48.631
Admit there is a variety of sexuality.

57:49.925 --> 57:51.639
I'm not trying to stop you have children.

57:51.640 --> 57:54.056
I'm not trying to do
anything to disrupt anyone.

57:54.057 --> 57:55.972
I just want some freedom for myself,

57:55.973 --> 57:57.725
and that's the argument
I make on the behalf

57:57.726 --> 57:59.647
of the 16 year old that I used to be.

58:01.770 --> 58:06.947
And if I became known as that gay actor,

58:08.151 --> 58:09.368
I didn't mind at all.

58:11.655 --> 58:15.660
I was a communicator, I was
an actor, I was a performer.

58:19.746 --> 58:22.499
And I felt I had found my
place in British society.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.377
I didn't have sex until
I was an undergraduate

58:26.378 --> 58:28.722
and I was just finishing
Cambridge when I fell

58:28.723 --> 58:31.799
in love with a beautiful boy from Kansas

58:31.800 --> 58:34.969
who was about to become
a professional actor.

58:34.970 --> 58:39.807
Curt and I and at last I felt
I had joined the human race.

58:39.808 --> 58:40.730
But not entirely,

58:40.731 --> 58:44.812
because still we didn't
talk about being gay.

58:44.813 --> 58:49.025
The idea of gay politics or any advance

58:49.026 --> 58:52.111
in gay rights just wasn't on the cards.

58:52.112 --> 58:56.741
And we were forced to live
in this odd no man's land

58:56.742 --> 59:01.964
of loving where you could and
no clubs, no bars, nothing.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.710
And one of the reasons I
became a professional actor

59:07.711 --> 59:10.214
was that I'd heard that
there were gay people

59:10.215 --> 59:12.298
in the professional theatre.

59:12.299 --> 59:14.884
(audience laughing)

59:14.885 --> 59:16.979
And it turned out to be the case.

59:16.980 --> 59:19.314
(laughing)

59:22.768 --> 59:26.353
The trouble about looking
back on even your own life

59:26.354 --> 59:31.576
and who knows it better than
one's self, and I get it wrong.

59:31.610 --> 59:33.155
My impression was that I always wanted

59:33.156 --> 59:36.623
to be a theatre actor and I was
happy being a theatre actor.

59:36.624 --> 59:40.785
I had no ambitions to become a film actor.

59:40.786 --> 59:42.584
Well, my friends tell
me that wasn't the case

59:42.585 --> 59:45.583
and I was always bellyaching
about why has Tom Courtney

59:45.584 --> 59:48.176
got this part, why is
Anthony Hopkins in films now?

59:48.177 --> 59:49.385
Why can't I be...

59:51.379 --> 59:53.973
I think I would judge the films I've made

59:53.974 --> 59:57.720
as before Richard Ill and after.

59:59.554 --> 01:00:02.389
After I had the confidence.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.985
When we were doing King Lear
and Richard Ill in America

01:00:05.986 --> 01:00:10.147
over I think five or six
cities across the States

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:14.028
on the suggestion of Richard
Eyre who had directed the play.

01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:17.822
When I asked him, "Couldn't we film it?"

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.996
I started writing the film script.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.501
And I had to start being a film producer,

01:00:25.502 --> 01:00:27.706
something I had never done before.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:28.629
And will never do again.

01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.335
It took two years of persuading people

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:34.681
that even on a limited
budget of $6 million,

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.051
we could ever make the money back.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:42.807
I used to get very, very
nervous on a film set

01:00:42.808 --> 01:00:44.058
because of my insecurity

01:00:44.059 --> 01:00:46.025
of not having done much film-making.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:51.438
In preparation for a rather
nerve-wracking business

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:54.150
of starring in a movie, I visited,

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:57.701
as I put it at the time,
other people's films.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.073
I just got to see how it worked.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:04.160
What it was like to be
in front of the camera.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.037
(sighing)

01:01:05.038 --> 01:01:06.832
We haven't got any
business done tonight.

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:09.333
[Stephen] Meet John
Profumo, Minister for War.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.752
One day, I suddenly
realised all these people

01:01:11.753 --> 01:01:14.630
behind the camera who had made me nervous,

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.474
were all there not to observe
and criticise and comment

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.845
behind their hands, but to help.

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:26.432
The director, looking.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.603
The cameraman, looking.

01:01:27.604 --> 01:01:28.853
Sound man, hearing.

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.229
Makeup, checking.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.857
Costume people, looking.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:38.777
All with their own
expertise, all contributing.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.576
And you're just the
centre of their attention

01:01:40.577 --> 01:01:42.787
because everybody wants
you to get it right.

01:01:42.788 --> 01:01:44.033
Everyone is supportive.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:47.745
They're not being critical.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:50.590
They're not observing, they're part of it.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:54.674
And that was a revelation.

01:01:54.675 --> 01:01:57.009
And now I find being on a studio one

01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:58.723
of the most comfortable places

01:01:58.724 --> 01:02:01.717
because everybody wants it to be good.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.637
Everyone's there together doing it.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.312
And I thought before they
were the enemy really,

01:02:07.313 --> 01:02:09.105
rather than the friend.

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:12.566
And the camera, well,
you just forget about it.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:17.233
You can't forget about it
but you know it's there

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.656
but it's another friend.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:24.120
The rest was easy because
I knew the part backwards.

01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:26.959
I knew what the production should be.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.161
I'd helped in the casting.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:30.755
We had a wonderfully strong cast of people

01:02:30.756 --> 01:02:33.000
who were very experienced in Shakespeare.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:38.259
And who were intrigued by the
idea of putting it on film.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.008
Richard Ill comes out, I'm
playing the leading part.

01:02:41.009 --> 01:02:46.013
I've got a credit <i>as</i> producer
and as screenplay writer.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:49.687
And it got good reviews
so oh hello, Ian McKellen,

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.277
does Shakespeare on film.

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:56.940
Oh, he's a film actor.

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:01.244
Why I can smile and
murder while I smile.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.081
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears

01:03:08.082 --> 01:03:10.670
and frame my face to all occasions.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.382
And therefore, since I
cannot prove a lover,

01:03:18.383 --> 01:03:21.714
I'm determined to prove a villain

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:25.436
and hate the idle
pleasures of these deaths.

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.438
Theatrical performance is appropriate

01:03:28.439 --> 01:03:32.725
because he's a theatrical
showoff, Richard III.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:35.605
So a certain presentation was appropriate.

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.441
Same with Magneto to a certain extent.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.532
Gandalf's a bit of a showoff <i>as</i> well.

01:03:42.533 --> 01:03:45.497
Those are the parts that I'm
perhaps the best at playing.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.788
- Thank you.
- The pleasure is mine.

01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:49.955
James Whale.

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:56.008
James Whale, I found a
very easy part to play.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:04:00.002
We had to shoot so much footage each day

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:02.963
in order to get through in the time

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:04.637
that the investment could buy.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.729
At the beginning of a long
speech that I was delivering

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:12.890
to Brendan at the end of a long day,

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:16.268
I think with about half an hour to go.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:23.484
So that work has to stop,
the director Bill Condon

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.486
said to me, "lan, that's the situation."

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:28.489
"And you've probably only got time"

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.449
"to do the speech twice
and it's a long speech."

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:31.542
"You might want to do it more than that."

01:04:31.543 --> 01:04:34.244
"If you do, just keep speaking."

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:36.497
"If you stop and come
to the end of the speech"

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:40.667
"and I say cut, that'll be the signal"

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:43.509
"for the plugs to be
pulled and for work to stop"

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:45.551
"and you'll never get another chance."

01:04:45.552 --> 01:04:48.222
"That's the nature of film,
it's your last chance."

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.309
Well, that's how I got through the speech.

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.933
I did it a number of
times and I didn't stop.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.527
And you just sit there.

01:04:57.528 --> 01:04:59.112
You let me talk.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:03.028
Yes, the poor old man you think
that I'm the crazy old poof.

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:04.900
Why are you here?

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:05.948
Let's get this straight.

01:05:05.949 --> 01:05:08.362
What do you want from me?

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.114
I want to be a model, remember?

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:10.991
Well of course I remember.

01:05:10.992 --> 01:05:12.992
What do you think I am, so fucking senile?

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:25.754
Mr. Whale?

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.678
How I could've been so stupid, stupid.

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.181
Mr. Whale, you all right?

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:41.522
What was I thinking about?

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.690
The day I was nominated for an Oscar,

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:48.569
I was playing in a repertoire of plays

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:52.072
for the West Yorkshire
Playhouse, which is in Leeds

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:53.620
in the North of England and I had to do

01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:56.743
all my interviews on a telephone line

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:58.704
in between performances.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:02.249
So I think life was going on as usual.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:05.210
I wasn't making any assumptions.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:09.047
The problem is, of course,
once you're up for an Oscar

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:12.139
or a Golden Globe even
or a BAFTA or something,

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.263
you are encouraged by
the publicity department

01:06:14.264 --> 01:06:17.097
for whatever you're being nominated for

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:18.566
to do all the interviews.

01:06:18.567 --> 01:06:23.395
To go around almost actively
touting for the vote

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:26.115
of the various members
of these organisations.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.443
That's a bit unseemly.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:33.155
And all the actors know it.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:36.873
And they feel embarrassed even
as they're holding their hand

01:06:36.874 --> 01:06:39.587
up and saying, "Look at me,
look at me, look at me."

01:06:39.588 --> 01:06:42.708
(audience applause)

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.502
And the success of that
film, I think has given me

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.881
as much pleasure as
anything else in my life.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:53.258
It's fun playing man who once lived.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.804
You have more scope, don't you,

01:06:54.805 --> 01:06:56.141
if you're playing a character

01:06:56.142 --> 01:06:58.014
that is entirely fictionalised.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:03.315
I thought, at the time, I
wasn't very good as Magneto,

01:07:03.316 --> 01:07:06.781
and I've had that confirmed
for me seeing the films.

01:07:06.782 --> 01:07:10.776
If you look at the comics,
Magneto is usually drawn

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.945
from a low vantage point.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.030
His legs wide apart.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:19.910
A superhuman body of
muscle and sinew and power.

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:22.664
But then there's me, Ian
McKellen, who (chuckling)...

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:29.044
I did ask for a suit that was made for me

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.343
which had false muscles in it
and they used to put that on

01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:35.264
diligently each day to
give myself wide thighs

01:07:35.265 --> 01:07:36.807
and calves and pecs.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:42.599
Becoming cartoon characters isn't easy.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.145
And we weren't helped by the costumes

01:07:44.146 --> 01:07:46.144
in which were costumes that fitted a film

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:49.524
rather than fitted the
outrageous nature of the story.

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.208
(grunting)

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.293
Mr. Laurio, never
trust a beautiful woman,

01:08:06.294 --> 01:08:08.419
especially one who's interested in you.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:12.301
Those stories mean something,

01:08:12.302 --> 01:08:14.095
and I think that's what separates our,

01:08:14.096 --> 01:08:17.175
perhaps, X-Men from the other comic books.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:20.970
Superman, the Hulk, Spider-Man,

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:23.645
I'd say even James Bond,
are all the same people.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:29.903
Wimps who change their underclothes
and become superheroes.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.158
Discover their inner life.

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.279
That's not Magneto.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:42.502
Magneto is a political
warrior, clear-sighted,

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:48.087
pained, anguished, determined character.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.551
Really well worth playing.

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:53.799
And in any civil rights movement,

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.298
there is an argument between
the Magneto character

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.426
who says we bloody well
fight to the bitter end

01:08:58.428 --> 01:09:01.761
and are proud of our
difference and if necessary

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:04.353
we'll be violent in our
own defence, a sense that,

01:09:04.354 --> 01:09:06.939
perhaps, our difference makes us superior.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:09.685
Well, that may be the Malcolm
X view of the black situation

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:13.523
or Martin Luther King the Professor X,

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:15.947
Patrick Stewart's character,
who says let's learn

01:09:15.948 --> 01:09:20.072
how we can contribute to
society, be a part of it.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.073
Fit in.

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:26.578
Be proud of ourselves but
care about people in society

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:27.626
beyond ourselves.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:31.087
So, those are stories worth telling.

01:09:31.089 --> 01:09:32.209
It's not just adventure.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.549
It's not just fantasy.

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:35.841
The war is still coming, Charles,

01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:40.560
and I intend to fight it,
by any means necessary.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:46.187
And I will always be there, old friend.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:51.145
(dramatic music)

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:58.112
Storytelling is so
basic to human activity,

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:02.202
as I suppose there isn't
a nationality in the world

01:10:02.203 --> 01:10:05.577
in which young children
aren't told stories.

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:08.874
And stories bring human beings together.

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:10.043
[Frodo] You're late.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:14.169
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:19.182
Nor is he early, he arrives
precisely when he means to.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.067
(laughing)

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.069
It's one of the things
I enjoy most about film

01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:34.655
is the reality of the set.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.571
In the theatre, it's all pretend,

01:10:37.572 --> 01:10:40.366
it's all make-believe, it's
all hardboard and canvas.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.790
Nothing what it seems,
which has its own delight.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:51.586
But you're on a set in Lord
of the Rings, and there it is.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.130
One day, we were lifted
up in a helicopter.

01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:58.549
I think I was the only
actor, the rest were doubles.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.510
And certainly the pony wasn't a real pony,

01:11:00.511 --> 01:11:03.550
it was a boy and his
girlfriend, that double.

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:05.269
They had a hard time
because we were dropped

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:09.181
by the helicopter onto
virgin snow on a high ridge.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:14.404
And you see this poor pony
try to walk very, very slowly.

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:16.813
Fall over into the snow.

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:19.158
And we were abandoned by the helicopter,

01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:21.026
in which was a camera,

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:23.530
and they filmed our progress up the ridge.

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:27.783
I think only once because
we had left our footprints

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.458
in the snow and therefore
couldn't do it twice.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:38.553
As we're going longer and I'm
going snow up to my knees,

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:41.301
with a perilous drop on one side

01:11:41.302 --> 01:11:46.519
and a bit of a peak at the
other, I could be on Everest.

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:50.857
It's about as far away from
green screen as you can get.

01:11:50.858 --> 01:11:52.600
We were there.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.194
Constantly, we were there.

01:11:55.195 --> 01:12:00.363
And you ask any of the actors,
there were other locations.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:03.777
I remember in The Hobbit other locations

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:06.281
we were, again, lifted up by helicopter.

01:12:06.282 --> 01:12:08.698
I had to spend a day in the sunshine

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:11.168
with a fantastic view
over some lake or other

01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:14.538
and surrounded by mountains.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:15.415
Bliss.

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:20.261
It was the lap of luxury
in the wildest of settings.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:26.341
I was doing an early scene
when all the dwarves,

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:31.564
small, plus Bilbo, small,
arrive in Bilbo's house,

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:34.057
and big Gandalf is there too.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:35.901
So I had to look bigger
than the rest of them.

01:12:35.902 --> 01:12:37.561
We rehearsed the scene.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:39.860
I met a group of actors
who I didn't really know

01:12:39.861 --> 01:12:41.606
in full makeup.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.656
I then left their set
and went into my own set

01:12:44.657 --> 01:12:48.446
which was made of green so
that it could be removed,

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:52.659
and a camera mirrored, it was
then slaved, is the phrase,

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.411
to the camera that was photographing

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:56.083
the dwarves at the same time.

01:12:56.084 --> 01:12:57.753
So these cameras moved at the same time.

01:12:57.754 --> 01:13:00.342
Their lenses moved in and out.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:02.591
Mine was done by a robot.

01:13:02.592 --> 01:13:04.885
It was just me and a moving camera.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:07.806
Where should I look?

01:13:07.807 --> 01:13:09.347
'Cause I'm meant to be talking to people

01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:11.311
who are on another part of the studio.

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:14.139
Well, they'd obligingly put photographs

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.984
of each of the actors on stands.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.400
And whoever was talking,
the light flashed.

01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:24.820
The trouble was that these
were photographs of the actors,

01:13:24.821 --> 01:13:26.818
not of the characters that I had just met.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.408
I didn't know who anybody was.

01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:30.498
That was green screen with a vengeance.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:34.248
And at the end of the day, my head fell

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.379
so that my mouth was very
close to the microphone

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:42.000
which was hidden in my
costume and I said to myself,

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:45.170
"This is not why I became an actor."

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:46.423
And I was quite tearful.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.017
This was broadcast
across the entire studio.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.845
I honestly cannot remember what this

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.314
has to do with the story at all, so...

01:13:55.315 --> 01:13:57.102
[Peter] You don't really need to.

01:13:57.103 --> 01:14:00.565
All right, so I'm just
looking vaguely apprehensive.

01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:03.777
[Peter] Vaguely apprehensive
and weary at the trees.

01:14:03.778 --> 01:14:06.947
This is potentially your first
shot in Return of the King.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:13.573
And action.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:16.623
(eerie epic music)

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:21.382
There are very few
actors who have been in two

01:14:21.383 --> 01:14:24.218
what are called franchises, two series,

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.674
popular, very popular movies.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:29.005
I was ready for it.

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:30.131
I wasn't phased by it.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:33.682
I was in my 50s or even older.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:37.058
On gay issues, I had been a spokesperson.

01:14:37.059 --> 01:14:38.348
Now I could be a spokesperson

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:39.441
for the films I was involved in.

01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:40.809
I was used to doing interviews.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.978
I was used to making the case.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:45.194
So that was a bit of
luck not to become famous

01:14:45.195 --> 01:14:47.157
and successful in films
when I was too young

01:14:47.158 --> 01:14:49.902
to quite know what I was doing.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:57.826
And very pleasing to me that
it was an openly gay man

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:58.703
who was playing Gandalf,

01:14:58.704 --> 01:15:01.627
an openly gay man who was playing Magneto.

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.002
There it was, everybody knew.

01:15:04.003 --> 01:15:06.340
A few people said we can't
have Gandalf the Gay,

01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:07.794
but apparently you could.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:08.671
Not that I played him gay.

01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:10.588
He's 7,000 years old,

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:13.183
I think sex was a thing
of the past for him.

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:17.434
What I'm not good at is
doing what I'm doing now

01:15:17.435 --> 01:15:20.140
which is trying to not edit myself.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:22.183
Not edit what I'm saying.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.106
Though of course we do.

01:15:23.107 --> 01:15:25.355
Just before we speak, we
think what we're going to say.

01:15:25.356 --> 01:15:27.397
But really, I do.

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:29.024
And sometimes I pause and think,

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:31.744
hm, what would be the
best way to put this.

01:15:31.745 --> 01:15:34.738
And it took, I think,
doing a comic version

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:37.868
of myself in a sketch
written by Ricky Gervais

01:15:37.869 --> 01:15:40.541
and Stephen Merchant, his writing partner,

01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:44.080
for their series Extras.

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:45.707
They wrote a comic version of myself,

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:49.586
a pompous actor, very pleased with himself

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:54.049
and probably some sonorous
tone came into my voice

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:58.344
and I talked about the
difficulties of my job

01:15:58.345 --> 01:16:00.143
and all that sort of thing.

01:16:00.144 --> 01:16:02.107
How do I act so well?

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:09.237
What I do is I pretend to
be the person I'm portraying

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.117
in the film or play.

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:14.360
Yeah.

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:15.237
You're confused.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.906
- No.
- Very simple, case and point.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:21.659
I was so alarmed at how
stupid and comic I was

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.250
with the slightly
exaggerated version of myself

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:27.749
that I realised that often
when I had been on chat shows

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.377
trying to be myself, what I had been

01:16:29.378 --> 01:16:31.753
is an exaggerated version of myself.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.094
The man who knows it
all, the man who's wise,

01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:35.924
the man who's been there, done that.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:36.925
Well.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:43.350
Now I'm trying to just speak to you.

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:46.601
Oh, here comes Ian McKellen.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.650
Now, what side of Ian McKellen
am I going to present?

01:16:48.651 --> 01:16:50.647
Am I going to talk seriously about gays,

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:55.654
in which the case I must drop
anything that looks unnatural.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:58.243
Am I going to talk about
the film or play I'm doing,

01:16:58.244 --> 01:17:00.786
which I'm hoping to
persuade people to come see?

01:17:00.787 --> 01:17:03.830
I must convey my enthusiasm
and I must also try

01:17:03.831 --> 01:17:05.370
and enthuse them, but who is them?

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.247
Who am I talking to?

01:17:06.248 --> 01:17:08.498
It's a puzzle.

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:12.003
But if you've got a message,
it's a puzzle worth solving

01:17:12.004 --> 01:17:13.925
and coming to terms with.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.100
[Interviewer] And mark it.

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:24.515
What are the things that
you think about the most?

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:27.267
Death.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:31.271
Every day-

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:39.113
I think about how it might come about.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.992
I would think about

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.927
how it would come about.

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:55.467
It must be that feeling,

01:17:55.468 --> 01:17:58.965
oh I reckon, I'm really
going to sleep now.

01:17:58.966 --> 01:18:01.845
Yeah, well, you can, forevermore.

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:06.389
You can imagine that
being quite attractive.

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.562
Particularly if you're in pain

01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:11.404
or you've lost your reason or something.

01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:17.859
I renovated my house recently
and I put in an elevator

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.658
that was fortunate, room for a lift.

01:18:19.659 --> 01:18:24.875
And I don't use it <i>as</i> yet, but it's there.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:28.124
Otherwise, I think am I
going to end up in a hospice

01:18:28.125 --> 01:18:32.207
or a hospital, or a geriatric
ward, or an old people's home?

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.006
Who's going to look after me there?

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:36.669
I don't have family.

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:41.049
I don't have any dependents
who are going to look after me.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.223
So I have to sort of organise that myself.

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:49.599
The other day, Sean Mathias,
who is one of the executives

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.977
in my world said, "Look, when you die",

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:55.068
"we're going to have
to organise a funeral,"

01:18:55.069 --> 01:18:56.940
"but I don't know what to do."

01:18:56.941 --> 01:19:00.610
"So would you please sort it out?"

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:01.703
That sort of turn.

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.328
Well, I had an evening to spare and I did.

01:19:05.329 --> 01:19:09.500
I had the most enjoyable
evening of (chuckling)

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:14.165
my wish list of what should happen.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:19.218
Initially, my funeral,
and then my memorial.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.888
I want no religion at either event.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:28.221
And I would like the
memorial to take place

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:30.099
in a celebratory way, in a theatre.

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:32.892
Free admission.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.232
And I want a lot of beautiful people.

01:19:36.233 --> 01:19:38.320
I don't want anyone who didn't know me

01:19:38.321 --> 01:19:39.658
who was in it to be paid.

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:43.528
And I thought I might like it to end

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:48.408
with one singular sensation
from a chorus line.

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:50.535
When I finished this I thought,

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:53.329
oh, I'd love to go to that funeral.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:56.291
(chuckling)

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:59.796
So, I hope I might arrange a
dress rehearsal before I go.

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:03.636
You're not told that, when you're young,

01:20:03.637 --> 01:20:07.387
that when you're old, you
think about death all the time.

01:20:07.388 --> 01:20:11.389
But I think it probably means
as I've noted with people

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:13.859
I've seen die, that they're ready.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:19.240
As I see other people getting
decrepit and unable to work,

01:20:19.241 --> 01:20:23.818
I think, well, that may well happen to me.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.368
And when it does, there's
not much I can do about it.

01:20:26.369 --> 01:20:30.700
But in the meantime, why
deny myself the pleasure

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:32.702
of rehearsing a play?

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:33.828
What am I to say?

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.955
<i>_</i> gay <i>I</i> am happy.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:36.957
I am happy-

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.585
- So am I.
- So am I.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:42.088
We are happy We are happy.

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:47.133
What do we do now that we're happy?

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:49.182
Of all the methods of telling stories,

01:20:49.183 --> 01:20:53.097
the one which the storyteller
is closest to the audience

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:57.018
is in what we call live theatre.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.317
Well, I don't think I've ever
been away from it, really.

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:03.524
I've never imagined not doing a play again

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.027
at the earliest opportunity.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:10.992
And when Godot ended, as
we bowed to the audience,

01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:20.251
thank you, thank you for coming,
hope you had a good time.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.046
Thank you, thank you.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:27.182
And I started to cry.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:52.325
(sobbing)

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:57.412
[Friend] It's all right, it's all right.

01:21:57.413 --> 01:22:00.758
I feel that's my last
performance on a stage ever.

01:22:00.759 --> 01:22:03.418
- That's silly.
- No, god.

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:06.546
No, darling, thank you so much.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.470
Thank you so, so much.

01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:15.012
The end of a play has been
so intense, it's a family.

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:16.890
A family has forged itself.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.936
A group who trust each
other, who want to be

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:22.779
in each other's company,

01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:26.366
who collectively are
taking responsibility.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:29.402
And then it stops.

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:33.033
Your life seems to be
pretty meagre in comparison.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:34.991
Mine does.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:39.036
Now, I haven't brought up children.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:42.540
I haven't had one constant
partner who I've been trying

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:46.210
to nourish a relationship
with a family life.

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:51.174
Which, probably, is more
satisfying than anything else

01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:53.009
you can possibly do.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:56.435
I don't have that, so I maybe invested

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.772
what's needed to have
kept that situation going

01:23:00.773 --> 01:23:02.769
into my work, perhaps.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:08.446
I am baffled how anybody can
bring up children and act.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:13.206
Because acting takes everything out of me.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.575
I don't seem to have anything left.

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:19.916
Sir Ian McKellen was
in Gloucestershire today

01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:22.085
helping pupils put together a play

01:23:22.086 --> 01:23:24.165
about homophobic bullying.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.668
Students from across the county were there

01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:29.170
to learn some hints and
tips from the master.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.591
What takes up quite a lot of time

01:23:30.592 --> 01:23:32.842
is visiting schools, at the moment.

01:23:32.843 --> 01:23:37.938
I tell them about my life
and a child as a gay boy.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:45.404
A trend seems to be rather
people in their early teens

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.274
don't want to have labels

01:23:47.275 --> 01:23:48.898
because they don't find them relevant,

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:50.989
that they want to be themselves.

01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:52.406
That's their label, me.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:59.327
And it's occurred to me that
the label I put on myself

01:23:59.328 --> 01:24:02.170
as being gay is actually a label,

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:06.212
although it has a new name
now, it used to be queer,

01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:09.462
that other people have put on
me, why should I be defined

01:24:09.463 --> 01:24:12.340
by my sexuality when anyone
who's straight isn't?

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:15.466
I now understand.

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.561
So perhaps I shall stop being gay.

01:24:17.562 --> 01:24:21.639
Perhaps it's time I stopped
talking being out of the closet.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.266
Remember, that's all in the past.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:24.357
So when you're with young people,

01:24:24.358 --> 01:24:25.773
you realise, even though you are old,

01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:29.397
you do have out of date attitudes.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:32.652
And how would I discover
that if I didn't meet them?

01:24:32.653 --> 01:24:35.200
So, I go along and the part I'm playing

01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:40.417
is of concerned older
gent who likes what I see

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:44.247
because when I was their
age, it didn't exist.

01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:46.710
Well, that's not true anymore.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:51.419
So I tell them what it used to
be like and their jaws drop.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.344
And of course, I go along as
the man who played Gandalf.

01:24:57.467 --> 01:24:59.140
And the first thing I say to them,

01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:04.142
and you know, I've polished
this little routine that I have.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:06.726
If you don't do your revision properly,

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:08.316
do you know what will happen?

01:25:08.317 --> 01:25:09.655
- What?
- What will happen?

01:25:09.656 --> 01:25:11.489
You shall not pass.

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:16.119
(cheering and applause)

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:19.572
And you know, little
Ian McKellen who thought

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:22.292
he might want to be an
actor, who enjoyed acting,

01:25:22.293 --> 01:25:30.284
never thought that actually
the real centre of his life

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:34.211
was nothing to do with acting at all.

01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:38.466
Well, that's what Roger Allam
or Mike Gambon or Judi Dench,

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:42.015
Maggie Smith, Martin Alpers,
would say about their lives,

01:25:42.016 --> 01:25:44.185
but they'd be referring to their children.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.935
I'm in the company of
strangers all day long.

01:25:47.936 --> 01:25:50.437
My professional life is
devoted to strangers.

01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:54.490
I think those of us
who don't have children

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:58.821
have a (sighing)

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:05.242
need to feel that some part of our lives

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:07.587
are just given to the next generations.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:17.427
It's very appealing if a
young actor knows something

01:26:17.428 --> 01:26:19.298
about what I've done in the past

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:22.760
and if it's had some
impact on them in some way.

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:24.807
Ed Norton tells me he
decided to become an actor

01:26:24.808 --> 01:26:27.183
when he saw me do my
one man Shakespeare show

01:26:27.184 --> 01:26:29.058
in Washington D.C.

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:32.732
And Michael Brambidge, a big
producer and director now,

01:26:32.733 --> 01:26:34.823
decided to become involved in theatre

01:26:34.824 --> 01:26:39.276
when he saw The Twelfth Night
that I had set up

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:40.494
and toured for the RC.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:43.072
That's lovely.

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:49.004
It used to be that it was my
secret, my life, my profession.

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:53.543
I found it difficult to
talk about, still do really.

01:26:53.544 --> 01:26:54.964
Although I'm coming on now.

01:26:56.211 --> 01:27:01.433
If I know about anything,
and I don't, I can't cook.

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:06.772
I can't run my finances.

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:12.945
I'm not an expert on anything
except this acting business.

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:15.860
And I can't even talk about that

01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:17.857
because what I do is very personal

01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:21.110
and I'm in with a group of people who

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:22.700
are all doing the same thing

01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:25.245
and they have been the
most wonderful friends

01:27:25.246 --> 01:27:29.410
and lovers and protectors and guides

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:32.039
and anything you could
want from a human being,

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.168
I've found in working in
the theatre particularly.

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:41.380
And now, I'm a senior
member of this large troupe.

01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:44.260
(dramatic music)

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.840
[Gandalf] You shall not pass!

01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:22.263
And isn't it funny,
these visits to schools,

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:26.675
my sister was a teacher.

01:28:26.676 --> 01:28:28.144
Her husband was a teacher.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:30.434
My uncle was a headteacher.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:39.605
Both grandparents were preachers.

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:41.153
My father was a lay preacher.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:43.901
I'm one of them.

01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:46.111
It turns out.

01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:50.785
Trying to change the
world, make it better.

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:55.788
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:57.336
And I wasn't in Harry Potter.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.251
(chuckling)

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:04.974
Though sometimes they say they
think I played Dumbledore.

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:08.300
And sometimes I think I did.

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:11.475
Oh, you know what it sounds
like, is this an obituary?

01:29:11.476 --> 01:29:13.849
I'm still alive, I'm still here.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:17.193
What sort of music do you like?

01:29:17.194 --> 01:29:18.769
House?

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:19.690
You what?

01:29:19.691 --> 01:29:20.691
No.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:23.150
I say indie pop-

01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:27.403
I don't know what it means.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:32.160
I think one thing I might
say to young Ian is you know,

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:36.038
you're quite attractive.

01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:44.008
I was.

01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:45.301
I didn't know.

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:48.634
Nobody ever told me.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:53.846
(phone ringing)

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:54.972
Hello.

01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:56.816
In fact, I thought on my 80th
birthday one of the things

01:29:56.817 --> 01:29:59.852
I might get myself would be an orchestra.

01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:00.853
Just for the day.

01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:05.065
Playing only tunes I knew whilst I sang.

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:06.567
Wouldn't that be fun?

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:10.362
I've had most of my haircuts
done for jobs, you know.

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:12.206
Somebody I don't know and
it probably not very good

01:30:12.207 --> 01:30:13.741
<i>at the“ 'yob comes and cuts my ha“.</i>

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:14.742
Thank you.

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:16.535
Free.

01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:18.913
And I wasn't nominated for Mr. Holmes.

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:21.123
I was a bit disappointed.

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:22.000
Because I thought it was sort

01:30:22.001 --> 01:30:25.504
of acting that they
might have appreciated.

01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:32.509
And I said, "Who wins these SAG Awards?"

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:35.220
And I looked it up on Google.

01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:37.019
Ran through all these famous actors.

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.393
Oh, Ian McKellen, oh.

01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:42.233
I won a SAG Award.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.564
I had forgotten.

01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:49.777
Well, Joe, I am bewildered, but
I don't know what we're doing

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:50.904
or what you're doing.

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:56.283
Life goes on and life
stops and then, you know.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.753
(whooshing)

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.832
But if I can help somebody...

01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:09.046
♪ If I can help somebody ♪

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:11.548
♪ As I pass along ♪

01:31:11.549 --> 01:31:19.479
♪ Then my living will not be in vain ♪

01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:22.818
Yeah, well that's about it, isn't it?
