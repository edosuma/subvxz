00:00.703 --> 00:02.703
<i>So here's what you missed on
Glee: Emma's living with Will,</i>

00:02.755 --> 00:04.673
<i>which has really been helping
her OCD, which is good, because</i>

00:04.724 --> 00:06.925
<i>she's helping Artie and
Beiste direct West Side Story.</i>

00:07.009 --> 00:08.894
<i>Rachel seems like a shoo-in for Maria,
and Kurt's running for class president</i>

00:08.978 --> 00:11.263
<i>so he can get into NYADA. Thank
you in advance for your votes.</i>

00:11.347 --> 00:13.899
<i>But Brittany quit as his campaign
manager so she can run, too.</i>

00:13.983 --> 00:17.469
<i>I'm also a unicorn. And
th's what you missed on Glee!</i>

00:19.705 --> 00:22.557
Five, six... ...seven, eight.

00:22.608 --> 00:24.943
(piano vamping)

00:26.162 --> 00:27.829
You're late.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.698
I know. I overslept.

00:29.749 --> 00:32.450
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

00:32.534 --> 00:35.337
My alarm clock went off 30
minutes late this morning.

00:35.404 --> 00:37.205
Kind of shifted my whole schedule.

00:37.256 --> 00:38.874
Anyway, what's Santana doing here?

00:38.925 --> 00:40.926
I've resworn my
allegiance to the Glee Club

00:41.010 --> 00:43.011
without telling Coach Sue.

00:43.078 --> 00:45.013
Mercedes, I'll catch you up.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.015
(piano vamping) Five, six, seven.

00:49.418 --> 00:50.802
Five, six...

00:52.638 --> 00:54.806
Mercedes, you okay? My stomach hurts.

00:54.891 --> 00:57.309
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Why are you babying her?

00:57.393 --> 00:59.311
I mean, she can't do
three steps without puking

00:59.395 --> 01:00.362
'cause she ate at Quizno's

01:00.429 --> 01:01.980
before she showed up in this joint.

01:02.064 --> 01:04.149
Mr. Shue, you have us scheduled
to the second right now.

01:04.233 --> 01:05.483
With school, Glee Club and Booty Camp,

01:05.568 --> 01:06.935
when else am I supposed to eat?

01:06.986 --> 01:08.954
When the rest of us
do. Oh, like you eat!

01:09.038 --> 01:10.906
It's not about eating.
It's about attitude.

01:10.957 --> 01:13.825
Sectionals are coming up, and
if we don't give it our all...

01:13.910 --> 01:15.327
I am doing my best.

01:15.411 --> 01:17.162
No, you're not.

01:17.246 --> 01:18.547
It's not about doing your best anymore.

01:19.174 --> 01:21.115
It's about doing better.

01:21.116 --> 01:26.118
<i>Synced By YesCool

01:29.225 --> 01:30.759
Morning, sunshine. Hey.

01:30.810 --> 01:32.627
Do you want me to iron
some bacon for you?

01:32.678 --> 01:35.764
Um, I was looking for a
fresh box of cornflakes,

01:35.815 --> 01:37.816
and I found this

01:37.900 --> 01:40.485
hidden way back in the pantry.

01:40.570 --> 01:42.187
It's a stash of wedding magazines.

01:42.271 --> 01:43.438
<i>Wedding, Inc.,</i>

01:43.489 --> 01:46.274
<i>Modern Bridal, Marry Me Monthly...</i>

01:46.325 --> 01:47.826
Oh, wow.

01:47.910 --> 01:49.744
Terri must have had a massive
bridal magazine addiction.

01:49.812 --> 01:52.414
And an autographed
headshot of Vera Wang.

01:52.481 --> 01:54.916
"To Emma. Always Marry Up!"

01:54.984 --> 01:57.085
Right, that's slightly
harder to explain away.

01:57.152 --> 02:01.039
Look, Emma, I'm not scared
of your inner bridezilla.

02:01.123 --> 02:03.258
I mean, that's clearly
the road we're headed down,

02:03.325 --> 02:06.628
and marriage is just one of...

02:06.679 --> 02:07.879
several milestones I look

02:07.964 --> 02:09.130
forward to sharing with you.

02:09.181 --> 02:10.931
But because I don't like secrets,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.719
I thought I'd share my
secret stash with you.

02:14.804 --> 02:16.471
I was a bachelor for over a year.

02:16.522 --> 02:17.806
Kept me off of Craig's List.

02:17.857 --> 02:20.275
Okay, we'll just put that over here.

02:20.342 --> 02:22.360
But Emma, I have to ask you a question:

02:22.445 --> 02:24.946
if you're serious about you and me...

02:25.014 --> 02:26.314
why haven't I met your parents?

02:26.365 --> 02:29.117
Be-because, um, they're dead.

02:29.184 --> 02:30.652
You spoke to them on
the phone last night.

02:30.703 --> 02:32.020
I spoke to their ghosts last night.

02:32.071 --> 02:33.121
I have ghost parents.

02:33.188 --> 02:35.573
Okay, can't lie to you. Um...

02:35.658 --> 02:38.493
I-I-I just want to
take it really slowly.

02:38.544 --> 02:41.029
You know, I don't want to rush things.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.464
And-And I feel like meeting

02:42.531 --> 02:46.200
my parents right now
would be a bad idea.

02:50.339 --> 02:51.673
(school bell rings)

02:51.724 --> 02:54.309
I must say Mr. Mike Chang
Sr., this is highly unusual.

02:54.377 --> 02:58.179
I have no grounds to drug
test your son every day.

02:58.230 --> 03:00.381
My grandmother in China
knew three English phrases:

03:00.433 --> 03:04.235
"Coca-Cola," "Kiss My Grits"
and "Harvard University."

03:04.320 --> 03:06.488
Deep in Hubei Province
this old woman knew

03:06.589 --> 03:08.590
the best school in the United States.

03:08.658 --> 03:09.891
That's where my son belongs.

03:09.942 --> 03:12.861
But what makes you think he's on drugs?

03:12.912 --> 03:14.195
He's one of our best students,

03:14.246 --> 03:16.865
a football star, and he
can bust a serious move.

03:16.916 --> 03:20.118
My son got an A-minus
on his chemistry test.

03:20.202 --> 03:22.454
An A-minus is an Asian F.

03:22.538 --> 03:25.840
Mr. Chang Sr., I don't want
to get in your business,

03:25.908 --> 03:28.626
as they say, but don't you
think perhaps you're putting

03:28.711 --> 03:30.628
too much pressure on Mike Chang Jr.?

03:30.713 --> 03:33.048
An A-minus won't do.

03:33.115 --> 03:33.882
It's the girlfriend.

03:33.933 --> 03:35.784
She's a distraction.

03:35.851 --> 03:40.105
Here's where we agree, sir.

03:40.189 --> 03:43.108
Tina Cohen-Chang and her
vampire ways have no place

03:43.192 --> 03:44.359
in this school.

03:49.365 --> 03:50.765
(hisses) (gasps)

03:50.816 --> 03:52.400
Excuse me from gym all year

03:52.451 --> 03:54.703
or I'll drain your spicy
curry blood. (hisses)

03:57.623 --> 03:59.407
It's clear to me that
either Michael is on drugs

03:59.458 --> 04:01.776
or that he's bitten off
more than he can chew.

04:01.844 --> 04:04.079
He needs to quit Glee Club.

04:04.130 --> 04:05.714
Performing is a waste of his time. What?

04:05.781 --> 04:07.248
(whispers): The consultant
we hired said that

04:07.316 --> 04:09.250
it was meaningless on your transcript.

04:09.318 --> 04:11.086
In fact, he said it was a detriment.

04:11.137 --> 04:13.555
I'll do better, Dad. I promise.

04:13.622 --> 04:16.007
Get me a chemistry tutor.
I'll pay for it myself.

04:16.091 --> 04:18.526
Just give me one more chance.

04:18.594 --> 04:19.844

<i>when I found out Ace
of Cakes was canceled,</i>

04:27.302 --> 04:28.737
hence the crutches.

04:28.804 --> 04:31.823
Number two: the entire
wrestling team has come down

04:31.907 --> 04:33.742
with a flesh-eating staph infection

04:33.809 --> 04:35.910
so, fellas, wash yourselves,

caves and your bramble patches.

04:40.366 --> 04:42.500
Puckerman, Azimio, show me your moves.

04:42.585 --> 04:45.120

my dad, he didn't raise me

04:52.962 --> 04:54.179
to be no damn ballerina.

04:54.263 --> 04:55.997
In fact, my dad, he
didn't even raise me.

04:56.048 --> 04:58.683

coordination, it boosts

05:31.300 --> 05:34.035
You just hugged your arch-nemesis
right before the audition.

05:34.086 --> 05:36.537
You think before I cleat
some dude I hug him?

05:36.589 --> 05:38.973
You think Wonder Woman hugs the
Cheeta before the Amazonian smackdown?

05:39.041 --> 05:41.209

Don't be going crazy now on me, Shane.

05:47.850 --> 05:49.934

Berry's the one to beat.

We've been practicing
your singing every day!

09:39.298 --> 09:40.498
You shouldn't have to hide your dreams.

09:40.582 --> 09:41.632
Just be honest with him.

09:41.717 --> 09:43.584
Oh, like how you were so honest

09:43.635 --> 09:44.986
about pretending to
stutter all that time?

Point taken.

With only two days left

09:52.761 --> 09:53.895

09:53.962 --> 09:55.096
that leaves me and Brittany

09:55.147 --> 09:56.681
running in this race.

09:56.765 --> 09:58.516
Which is more like me
running, and you know,

09:58.600 --> 10:00.234
Brittany just whimsically
hopping and skipping nearby.

10:00.302 --> 10:01.352
No one takes her seriously.

10:01.437 --> 10:02.854
That's so amazing, Kurt.

10:02.938 --> 10:05.022
I mean, you can
practically add the moniker

10:05.107 --> 10:08.142
of "President" to your curriculum
vitae now. NYADA is gonna eat that up.

10:08.193 --> 10:10.144
According to the new Jacob
Ben Israel straw poll--

10:10.195 --> 10:12.613
here, take one take one, take... Okay.

10:12.664 --> 10:14.815
Um, according to the soft numbers,

10:14.867 --> 10:16.817
I'm ahead by Brit by 11%. Really?

10:16.869 --> 10:19.454
This could be a cakewalk.
SANTANA: Nice blouse, Hummel.

10:19.505 --> 10:21.372
Really brings out the
color of your pink eye.

10:21.457 --> 10:24.509
So, I assume I can rely on your
vote, Rachel. I'm sorry, Brittany,

10:24.593 --> 10:26.043
but I've already pledged
my fidelity to Kurt.

10:26.128 --> 10:28.880
Oh, so you're cool with flushing
McKinley High's future down

10:28.964 --> 10:31.382
the magical poop-stealing water
chair? Did you know that in six years

10:31.467 --> 10:34.051
at this school, we've only exclusively
had male student council presidents?

10:34.136 --> 10:36.437
And yeah, Kurt looks like
Jimmy Fallon's butch daughter,

10:36.505 --> 10:38.306
but a vote for him would only empower

10:38.357 --> 10:40.141
yet another frank and beans.

10:40.192 --> 10:41.893
Yes. Where has that
patriarchy gotten us?

10:41.977 --> 10:44.011
Double-digit inflation,
economic freefall,

10:44.062 --> 10:46.030
oil spills, war in Afghanistan.

10:46.115 --> 10:48.866
I tweeted about Brit's flash
mob pep rally in the gym,

10:48.951 --> 10:51.152
and we're all showing up to
support her with girl power.

10:51.203 --> 10:53.371
Yes, boys have made one
helluva mess in this school,

10:53.455 --> 10:56.407
and there's only one way to clean it up.

13:15.981 --> 13:18.032
It's too close to call. What is?

13:18.117 --> 13:19.067
Marias.

13:19.151 --> 13:20.485
We have two very strong,

13:20.536 --> 13:22.954
but very different
candidates tied for the role.

13:23.021 --> 13:24.122
Rachel Berry and...?

13:24.189 --> 13:25.206
Mercedes.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.791
I thought Berry had it in the bag,

13:26.859 --> 13:28.743
and then Stealth-Attack Jones came in

13:28.828 --> 13:30.628
and just pancaked me emotionally.

13:30.696 --> 13:33.298
Yeah. I mean, right before our
eyes, Mercedes just transformed.

13:33.365 --> 13:35.533
She had a new maturity, there was

13:35.584 --> 13:37.168
a confidence I've never seen before.

13:37.219 --> 13:39.337
Her performance was so truthful.

13:39.388 --> 13:40.638
I think our little girl's

13:40.706 --> 13:42.090
all grown up.

13:42.174 --> 13:44.426
Wow. I'm so happy to hear that.

13:44.510 --> 13:46.644
I don't know what you're doing,
Schuester, but it's working.

13:46.712 --> 13:49.898
Well, I have been pushing
her pretty hard in Booty Camp.

13:49.982 --> 13:51.266
Good. Good for Mercedes.

13:51.350 --> 13:53.268
Yes, but very hard for us.

13:53.352 --> 13:54.269
(laughter)

13:54.353 --> 13:56.354
I mean, Rachel is Maria.

13:56.405 --> 13:57.388
Isn't she? Yes.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.523
On the other hand,

13:58.574 --> 13:59.524
Mercedes is...

13:59.575 --> 14:01.409
Is the riskier choice, no doubt.

14:01.494 --> 14:03.828
And she might even be
the more exciting one.

14:03.896 --> 14:05.947
It's just too close to call.

14:06.031 --> 14:09.334
Well, you know what
you need to do, then.

14:09.401 --> 14:11.753
Let me get this straight.
You can't make up your minds,

14:11.837 --> 14:13.204
so we have to try out again?

14:13.255 --> 14:14.539
In the biz, it's called a callback.

14:14.590 --> 14:16.040
With such an iconic role as Maria,

14:16.091 --> 14:17.592
it can't appear as if they're
just giving me the part.

14:17.676 --> 14:19.294
We'd like you both to come back

14:19.378 --> 14:20.295
on Thursday for

14:20.379 --> 14:21.679
the ultimate Maria-off.

14:21.747 --> 14:23.247
Done. I can't speak for Mercedes,

14:23.299 --> 14:26.250
but I'll be singing the timeless
Maria classic "I Feel Pretty."

14:26.302 --> 14:27.719
Actually, that's too easy, Rachel.

14:27.770 --> 14:29.888
We've picked a song that
we think has the potential

14:29.939 --> 14:31.306
to show off both of your talents,

14:31.390 --> 14:33.090
in unexpected ways.

14:33.142 --> 14:34.926
"Out Here On My Own" from the seminal

14:34.977 --> 14:35.927
<i>behind-the-scenes

14:38.731 --> 14:41.098
Mercedes!

14:41.150 --> 14:44.319
Look, in the spirit of Broadway
camaraderie, I'd like to

14:44.403 --> 14:47.271
offer you a hug to congratulate
you on your callback.

14:47.323 --> 14:50.107
You know what, Rachel?

14:50.159 --> 14:52.210
Hug me after I get the part.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.050
(school bell ringing)

14:59.117 --> 15:02.337
I'm leaving right now to go meet
the Chem tutor at The Lima Bean.

15:02.421 --> 15:04.973

16:05.183 --> 16:07.235
We've worked so hard
to get to where we are.

16:07.319 --> 16:10.672
And this, this is how
you waste your time?

16:10.739 --> 16:12.774
Dancing is something
you do at a wedding.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.459
It's a hobby, not a career.

16:14.526 --> 16:16.377
(echoing): There's no future in it.

16:18.664 --> 16:21.299

16:21.366 --> 16:24.469

16:24.536 --> 16:26.337

16:39.551 --> 16:44.022

you hardly ever sing,

16:44.073 --> 16:49.393
but when I see you do
that, it's who you are.

16:49.445 --> 16:53.114
It's what makes me feel you.

16:53.198 --> 16:56.751
Mike, you got to know by
now, when I see you dance...

16:58.704 --> 17:00.638

a girl in this school,

21:02.193 --> 21:03.276

21:28.853 --> 21:30.586
That's awesome.

21:34.859 --> 21:37.110
The cast list goes up on Friday.

21:37.194 --> 21:38.361
Are you nervous?

21:38.428 --> 21:40.596
A little. I'm trying
not to think about it.

21:40.648 --> 21:42.315
I wouldn't be. My mole
in the casting office

21:42.399 --> 21:43.783
says that there's only one actor

21:43.868 --> 21:45.201
they're seriously considering
for the role of Tony,

21:45.269 --> 21:47.620
and his initials are B.A.

21:50.574 --> 21:54.127
Kurt, they're beautiful.

21:54.211 --> 21:55.945
But what are they for?

21:55.996 --> 21:57.130
You killed your audition, Blaine.

21:57.214 --> 21:58.548
If anyone else got Tony,

21:58.615 --> 22:00.416
including me, the Wrath of Sondheim

22:00.467 --> 22:01.718
would fall upon William McKinley

22:01.785 --> 22:04.504
like a plague of Shubert Alley locusts.

22:04.588 --> 22:08.007
These are to celebrate... you.

22:08.092 --> 22:12.095
You always zig when I
think you're about to zag,

22:12.146 --> 22:15.648
and I... I just...
I love that about you.

22:18.802 --> 22:19.819
Thank you.

22:19.904 --> 22:22.021
(whispers): Right.

22:26.744 --> 22:29.445
Okay, so, before we dive
into today's Booty Camp,

22:29.496 --> 22:31.614
I just want to say how
impressed Mike and I have been

22:31.665 --> 22:34.534
with everyone's progress. Uh...

22:34.618 --> 22:36.169
Brittany, why are you here?

22:36.253 --> 22:37.453
'Cause I intend on, you know,

22:37.504 --> 22:39.172
dancing my way into the voters' hearts.

22:39.256 --> 22:41.341
Okay.

22:41.425 --> 22:43.793
All right... everyone up!

22:43.844 --> 22:46.262
Now, your homework assignment
was "The Widow Maker,"

22:46.330 --> 22:48.882
perhaps the hardest show
choir dance move ever.

22:48.966 --> 22:52.268
Now, when you get it right,
one of us is gonna tap you out,

22:52.336 --> 22:53.269
then you can have a seat.

22:53.337 --> 22:54.971
Uh, five, six, seven, eight!

22:55.022 --> 22:57.523
(piano music begins)

22:57.608 --> 22:59.058
(speaking indistinctly)

23:00.945 --> 23:01.728
Okay.

23:04.398 --> 23:06.366
(talking quietly)

23:06.450 --> 23:07.617
You have it. Yeah.

23:07.684 --> 23:10.453
MIKE: Come on,
Mercedes-- down, open.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.989
Come on, Finn, you can
do it! No, he can't.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.240
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

23:14.325 --> 23:15.875
Come on, Mercedes.

23:17.912 --> 23:18.795
Good job, buddy.

23:18.862 --> 23:19.629
MIKE: Down... open...

23:19.696 --> 23:21.547
Come on, Mercedes, down...

23:21.632 --> 23:24.384
open... up...

23:24.468 --> 23:25.752
My ankle hurts. Push through it.

23:25.836 --> 23:27.220
I don't feel good. You're fine.

23:27.304 --> 23:29.422
No, I'm not!

23:29.506 --> 23:32.842
Look, Mercedes, I want you to
be the best you can be, okay?

23:32.893 --> 23:34.260
Did you even practice this?

23:34.345 --> 23:35.979
Stop picking on me!

23:36.046 --> 23:38.314
You're always singling me
out, making me look bad!

23:38.382 --> 23:39.882
That's crazy. No, you're crazy

23:39.934 --> 23:41.317
for not letting me shine!

23:41.385 --> 23:42.735
Where's Rachel, huh?

23:42.820 --> 23:45.071
I don't see her here,
being a part of the "team."

23:45.155 --> 23:46.105
Rachel practices every night.

23:46.190 --> 23:47.991
No one asked you, Finn.

23:48.058 --> 23:49.075
Everyone knows that
Rachel is your favorite.

23:49.159 --> 23:50.493
That's not true.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.744
No, it's true-- you
give that skinny,

23:51.829 --> 23:53.196
Garanimal-wearing
ass-kisser everything!

23:53.247 --> 23:54.664
And, you know, for two
years, you know, I took it.

23:54.731 --> 23:56.232
But not anymore!

23:56.283 --> 23:57.250
I'm done!

24:00.621 --> 24:02.672
You know, I've outgrown you.

24:02.739 --> 24:03.957
I've outgrown all of you.

24:06.576 --> 24:07.760
Mercedes!

27:20.737 --> 27:22.521

tutor when you didn't show up.

27:56.189 --> 27:58.741
my job is to encourage
you to live your dreams,

27:58.825 --> 28:02.061
not mine, not your dad's.

28:02.112 --> 28:03.395
I was raised a certain way,

28:03.447 --> 28:05.081
and my parents had expectations of me

28:05.165 --> 28:08.584
and I simply was not
as courageous as my son.

28:08.668 --> 28:11.037
I let go of my dreams but

28:11.088 --> 28:13.873
I never want you to do that.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.508
Do you hear me?

28:15.575 --> 28:16.675
So...

28:16.743 --> 28:18.344
do you know if we earned that part

28:18.411 --> 28:19.295
in the school musical yet?

28:21.748 --> 28:24.133
Well, when you do, we're going
to tell your father about it.

28:25.635 --> 28:26.619

28:40.951 --> 28:43.018
So what dream did you let go of?

Coach Beiste, I have something
very important we need to discuss.

32:53.035 --> 32:53.035
+

33:06.624 --> 33:11.828
What is this? Are we having
a romantic dinner? Sort of.

33:11.912 --> 33:13.329
I invited your parents over.

33:13.414 --> 33:16.666
Is that my little freaky-deaky?

33:16.751 --> 33:18.802
Okay. I'm gonna say hi in one minute.

33:18.886 --> 33:22.222
One minute, one minute.
Oh, God, oh my God.

33:22.289 --> 33:24.557
Why would you do this? I
wanted to meet your parents,

33:24.625 --> 33:26.626
so I thought I'd take
the bull by the horns.

33:26.677 --> 33:29.729
Right, it's okay, because maybe,
maybe we can get them to leave.

33:29.797 --> 33:32.732
I will pretend like, um,
an ovarian cyst burst.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.267
Works every time. Emma,
what is going on here?

33:34.318 --> 33:36.186
Are you ashamed of me?

33:36.270 --> 33:38.188
No.

33:38.272 --> 33:40.306
I'm ashamed of them.

33:40.357 --> 33:41.808
What? Why?

33:41.859 --> 33:44.694
My parents are ginger supremacists.

33:45.846 --> 33:47.280
We're not ginger supremacists.

33:47.331 --> 33:48.882
We're more ginger preservationists.

33:48.949 --> 33:50.450
We don't hate anybody.

33:50.518 --> 33:53.820
We just prefer the company of
other redheads, which is why we

33:53.871 --> 33:55.988
enjoy the Red Oaks so
much. What's the Red Oaks?

33:56.040 --> 33:57.874
It's a gingers-only country club.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.926
It's really the only place
I feel I can be myself

33:59.993 --> 34:01.294
and let my auburn hair down.

34:01.362 --> 34:03.596
Did you know that if we're not careful,

34:03.664 --> 34:06.049
redheads will be extinct
in 30 years? Extinct?

34:06.133 --> 34:09.268
It's a recessive gene. If
we keep heading down the road

34:09.335 --> 34:12.722
we're on, with everybody
just mixing with everybody,

34:12.806 --> 34:15.641
we gingers will cease
to exist as a species.

34:15.693 --> 34:18.895
Not really a separate species. Which is why
I'd really love to hear about your heritage.

34:18.978 --> 34:21.397
I have to say, your
hair's a little wooly

34:21.482 --> 34:24.567
for my taste, but those
beautiful blue eyes

34:24.652 --> 34:26.518
are a very good sign. Now
Schuester is German, right?

34:26.570 --> 34:28.154
I-I think so.

34:28.205 --> 34:29.455
You're practically a Viking.

34:29.523 --> 34:31.206
Hey. Well, that's a relief.

34:31.292 --> 34:33.208
There's got to be some red
hair in that family tree.

34:33.293 --> 34:35.661
Yeah, not like that Carl.

34:35.713 --> 34:38.414
Oops. Looks like freaky-deaky's

34:38.498 --> 34:41.199
coming down with a mean
case of the cleanies.

34:41.252 --> 34:44.003
Don't bother trying to stop
her once she starts, Will.

34:44.054 --> 34:46.472
We used to tie her thumbs
together, and she'd chew

34:46.540 --> 34:48.507
right through the twine. Adorable.

34:48.559 --> 34:51.393
I think it's weird. I
don't know where she got it.

34:53.514 --> 34:54.981
Oh, I'm sorry, Amigo.

34:55.047 --> 34:57.250
You're not our regular waitress.

34:57.318 --> 34:58.935
RUSTY: Cindy! ROSE: You
can't be too careful.

35:05.276 --> 35:07.660
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be rude, but has anyone

35:07.728 --> 35:08.945
ever told you that you're
both a little racist?

35:09.029 --> 35:10.730
I'm sorry?

35:10.781 --> 35:12.832
Excuse me, it's not racist
to be proud of the heritage

35:12.900 --> 35:14.901
that you're trying to preserve, Will.

35:14.952 --> 35:17.236
Well, maybe it isn't. But all
I know is that if Emma and I

35:17.288 --> 35:18.955
were blessed enough to have a child,

35:19.039 --> 35:21.574
I wouldn't care what he or she
looked like. And you know what?

35:21.625 --> 35:24.527
If my child had OCD, I'd maybe
try to show a little compassion

35:24.595 --> 35:26.913
instead of calling her a
name that makes her feel

35:26.964 --> 35:28.665
like a freak.

35:31.936 --> 35:34.020
These beans are a disaster.

35:34.087 --> 35:36.589
RUSTY: These beans are what
happens when you sit out

35:36.640 --> 35:39.692
an election, Rose. There
wasn't a ginger candidate.

35:39.760 --> 35:40.777
(school bell rings)

35:40.861 --> 35:44.113
I think we should talk, don't you?

35:44.198 --> 35:46.933
About the, um, upcoming deadline
for the NYADA applications?

35:46.984 --> 35:50.036
About you telling Coach Beiste that
you're running for senior class president.

35:50.103 --> 35:53.039
Against me. Kurt, you
saw Mercedes, okay?

35:53.106 --> 35:56.275
I'm not gonna get the part.
So I figured, if I win,

35:56.327 --> 35:59.779
I'll make you vice president, and then
maybe you could just do vice-versa.

35:59.830 --> 36:04.050
Rachel, if you win, yes, it'll better
your chances of getting into NYADA, yes.

36:04.117 --> 36:07.420
But if I win, it could make a
huge difference at this school.

36:07.471 --> 36:10.256
Not just for me, but kids like me.

36:10.307 --> 36:12.308
Things could actually change for them.

36:12.393 --> 36:16.095
So, whatever it takes, I'm winning.

36:16.146 --> 36:18.314
Look, I just... I need
something for my senior year

36:18.399 --> 36:21.100
that's gonna make me special,
that's gonna make me stand out.

36:21.151 --> 36:23.152
I thought Maria was gonna
be that. You understand.

36:23.237 --> 36:25.488
You're just as ambitious as I
am; that's why we're friends.

36:25.572 --> 36:28.307
Rachel, in ten years, when
you look back on this time,

36:28.359 --> 36:30.743
you're not gonna be thinking
about the clubs you belonged to

36:30.811 --> 36:32.328
or the parts you had.

36:32.413 --> 36:34.864
You'll be thinking about
the friends you had and...

36:34.949 --> 36:37.300
and the ones you just tossed aside.

36:41.541 --> 36:41.541
+

36:42.883 --> 36:44.768
Please don't tell us that
we have to try out again.

36:44.852 --> 36:47.654
No, we've come to a decision.

36:47.721 --> 36:49.722
It was one of the hardest
decisions of my life,

36:49.774 --> 36:51.358
and that includes when I had to sell

36:51.409 --> 36:53.793
one of my two prize
donkeys to pay my gas bill.

36:53.861 --> 36:55.495
I sold Kim, but I kept Khloe.

36:55.562 --> 36:59.532
So, um, in the grand tradition
of the Special Olympics...

36:59.583 --> 37:02.502
everybody wins. We're
double-casting Maria.

37:02.569 --> 37:04.587
What the hell is "double-casting?"

37:04.672 --> 37:06.589
It means that we'll
both get to play Maria.

37:06.674 --> 37:09.175
You'll get your well-deserved
standing ovations

37:09.243 --> 37:10.960
on Saturday matinees and
Sunday mornings for the Retired

37:11.028 --> 37:13.430
Lima War Veterans, and I'll do
all the evening performances.

37:13.514 --> 37:15.748
Actually, Rachel, we're adding a week.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.084
You'll both get four
nights and two matinees.

37:18.135 --> 37:20.186
Fair enough.

37:20.254 --> 37:23.306
Mercedes, it'll be a pleasure
sharing the spotlight with you.

37:23.391 --> 37:26.309
Are you double-casting any other roles?

37:26.394 --> 37:27.310
No. Just... No. No.

37:27.395 --> 37:29.529
Thank you for your time.

37:29.596 --> 37:31.114
Where are you going?

37:31.198 --> 37:33.533
Tell me you were better than me.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.236
Tell me.

37:36.287 --> 37:39.155
(stammers) Why is it that no one
ever wants to hurt her feelings?

37:39.240 --> 37:41.774
You know, it's always been "The
Rachel Berry Show" around here.

37:41.826 --> 37:44.110
But it's not gonna be for
me. No, not my senior year.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.745
Mercedes, don't make
this a stupid pride thing.

37:45.796 --> 37:48.448
Oh, it's a pride thing.
But it's not stupid.

37:48.499 --> 37:52.051
Congratulations. You got the part.

37:52.119 --> 37:53.186
I don't want it.

37:57.341 --> 37:59.726
(school bell rings)

37:59.793 --> 38:01.644
I got it.

38:01.729 --> 38:04.397
I got it, like, by default.

38:04.465 --> 38:06.699
They double-cast us, and
then Mercedes turned it down.

38:06.767 --> 38:10.236
So... cool. You're gonna... you're
gonna be withdrawing from the race, then.

38:10.304 --> 38:12.906
Look, Finn, when Brittany sang
that song about girls changing

38:12.973 --> 38:14.941
the world, it got me
thinking, you know maybe...

38:14.992 --> 38:17.994
maybe I can change the world.
By being Student Class President?

38:18.078 --> 38:19.946
Look, make fun of it all
you want, but you need

38:19.997 --> 38:21.981
to start thinking
about your future, too.

38:22.032 --> 38:26.319
Oh, did you talk to
Kurt about the election?

38:26.370 --> 38:27.954
Yeah.

38:28.022 --> 38:30.924
He asked me who I was voting for.

38:30.991 --> 38:32.876
What did you say?

38:32.960 --> 38:35.295
I said I didn't know.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.354
Emma.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.706
Son of a biscuit. I've lost count again.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.995
(whispers): One.

39:09.046 --> 39:11.030
Two...

39:11.081 --> 39:13.550
Three... I'm so sorry.

39:13.634 --> 39:16.503
I should've believed you when you told me
you didn't want me to meet your parents.

39:16.554 --> 39:18.171
I didn't get it.

39:18.222 --> 39:19.422
Emma, stop.

39:19.507 --> 39:21.407
Please.

39:21.475 --> 39:24.978
Come on, let's go to bed.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.714
Wh-What are you doing?

39:28.766 --> 39:30.600
I'm praying.

39:32.887 --> 39:35.138
I do it all the time in my head,

39:35.206 --> 39:36.906
but right now, it's just not enough.

39:36.991 --> 39:41.661
And when I need help, I know
God hears me better on my knees.

39:41.728 --> 39:44.731
Something about the acoustics
of the linoleum or something.

39:44.798 --> 39:46.866
(sighs)

39:46.917 --> 39:50.236
I wish I could make
things better for you, I...

39:50.287 --> 39:52.171
I just don't know how.

40:01.465 --> 40:04.551
I don't have any clue what
I'm doing down here... (laughs)

40:06.353 --> 40:07.554
But I'm willing to learn.
