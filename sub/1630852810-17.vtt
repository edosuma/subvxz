WEBVTT

00:32.866 --> 00:34.993
Beanie!

00:35.535 --> 00:37.328
Hey, you're alive!

00:37.412 --> 00:39.539
- Yay!
- Crazy girl!

00:39.622 --> 00:42.208
Bean in the house!

00:50.300 --> 00:54.345
Oh, Bean, every time I find you alive
is such nice surprise.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.806
You never hugged me because I was alive.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.558
I hate this family.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.519
So, what the heck happened?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.564
How'd you manage
to get back to shore before us? Huh?

01:04.647 --> 01:08.193
Oh, a sea turtle gave me a ride back.
That's what happened.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.527
Sea turtles aren't that fast.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.987
Why does… Why does it matter?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.031
We're concerned with sea turtles now?

01:13.114 --> 01:14.324
Just be happy I'm alive.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.493
- Like I am.
- Jeez.

01:16.576 --> 01:20.330
Okay, I will take that answer
at face value and not ask you about

01:20.413 --> 01:23.583
that mysterious, new necklace
you're obviously hiding.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.253
Listen up, y'all,
Queen Bean is back from the dead

01:27.337 --> 01:29.964
and orders you to spend
your money at Luci's pub.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.424
I didn't really, but whatever.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.011
Half-eaten nachos half-off
for all pants-crappin' low lives.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.387
Ha! That's me.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.849
Come and get it.
Drink up, you scumbags.

01:48.733 --> 01:49.609
Hmm?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.824
Oh, no, they're back.

01:55.907 --> 01:56.866
Yee-haw!

01:57.450 --> 02:01.746
Uh-uh, I've always been a firm believer
in "stand your ground" until now.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.376
Okay, girls, set wings to haul ass.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.846
Look at all the romance all over there.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.973
Everyone's got someone but me.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.432
And I'm the King.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.226
King of loneliness.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.355
And the duke of horniness.

02:29.732 --> 02:33.278
At least Oona knows
how heartbreak feels.

02:38.449 --> 02:43.371
Back for 20 minutes and already
the solitude is more than I could bear.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.623
Bear…

02:45.707 --> 02:48.668
Ursula the bear.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.217
Eh, Bean, do you mind?

02:56.301 --> 02:58.428
I'm trying to be depressed over here.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.596
I was here first, Dad.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.264
Aw, sweetie…

03:01.347 --> 03:02.599
All right, what's going on?

03:02.682 --> 03:05.643
You only "Aw, sweetie" me
if you just executed one of my friends.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.770
Look, Porky was a mistake.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.314
I just want to know…

03:09.397 --> 03:11.107
- Are you happy?
- What?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.735
Yeah, I mean,
I have my very own kingdom.

03:13.818 --> 03:14.903
Great friends.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.362
Except, Porky's gone now.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.197
I have this bitching crown--

03:18.281 --> 03:20.992
Hold on a minute,
you didn't answer my question.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.452
Are you happy?

03:23.411 --> 03:25.038
Yeah… No.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.956
What's happy, really?

03:27.665 --> 03:29.918
Oh, my God, you're in love.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.003
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.713
I don't know what I was thinking--

03:33.796 --> 03:34.797
Maybe I am.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.716
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.427
The thing is,
I just don't know what's going on.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.971
Oh, yeah, I've been there.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.849
And when you finally do
figure it out, it's too late.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.726
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.103
One moment,
it's all ukuleles in moonlight,

03:49.187 --> 03:51.231
and then it's just gone.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.690
Is there something wrong with me?

03:52.774 --> 03:56.194
Why can't I stop thinking
about that stupid, perfect mermaid?

03:56.277 --> 03:57.654
Mermaid, huh?

03:57.737 --> 04:00.365
Hey, if you don't like it,
I will fight you.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.078
You know, my first love
was a mermaid, too.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.122
- Really?
- Oh, like father, like daughter.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.166
Oh, boy, that was a doozy.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.501
It didn't work out.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.169
I mean, we were so different.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.546
She was a blonde, I had red hair.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.008
And mermaid culture…
Oof, so much wetter than ours.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.009
Oh.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.011
- Did she break your heart?
- Worse.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.554
We broke each other's hearts.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.181
Yeah, that's the scary part.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.350
Uh, story of my life.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.769
I was always too afraid to try.

04:29.852 --> 04:30.979
Remember Ursula?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.188
Ursula the bear?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.023
Yeah, I remember Ursula.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.858
She thought I was a giant squirrel.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.986
Man, I was crazy about her,

04:38.069 --> 04:41.072
but I always told myself
it wasn't the right time.

04:41.155 --> 04:46.244
It's only now that I realize
that there's never a right time for love.

04:46.327 --> 04:49.080
- Love is always risky.
- And confusing.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.832
- And freaky.
- And scary.

04:50.915 --> 04:51.833
And sweet.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.918
And unexpected, like a sucker punch.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.545
- Boom!
- Ow.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.005
I'll come back later.

04:57.088 --> 05:00.216
Dad, if you think Ursula's the one,
you've got to try.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.342
You think so?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.886
Don't let fear
get in the way of happiness.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.723
Get out of here
and go find that destructive bear-woman.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.641
- I'll watch the throne.
- Really?

05:09.934 --> 05:12.312
Thanks, Beanie.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.772
You give good advice.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.024
You know what I wish?

05:16.107 --> 05:17.608
You'd take it once in a while.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.069
I'll think about it…

05:21.446 --> 05:22.739
every night…

05:24.073 --> 05:25.450
for the rest of my life.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.832
Page boy, take the throne.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.587
I could so overthrow you.

05:38.254 --> 05:42.175
Sorcerio, whip me up some kind of
magic potion to attract bears!

05:42.258 --> 05:44.260
Oh, you've come to the right place.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.470
You have your choice.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.222
Rancid butter, fermented salmon oil

05:48.306 --> 05:50.183
or hot garbage juice.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.351
All of the above.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.268
Oh, my.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.811
Start smearing.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.779
King Zøg, you didn't sign out.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.238
Where are you going?

06:04.322 --> 06:08.534
Don't follow me.
I'm on a secret mission.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.745
"Secret mission"? What does that mean?

06:10.828 --> 06:13.164
That means we follow him in secret.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.499
No, it doesn't!

06:21.672 --> 06:23.716
Ah, all alone.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.136
Just me and the sounds of the forest.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.514
Who's there?

06:31.349 --> 06:33.434
The hell kind of bird is that?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.602
Tit willow.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.563
Ow!

06:37.647 --> 06:39.399
Okay, now listen.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.693
I want you to stay far away from me.

06:42.777 --> 06:47.323
Watch the direction I go,
and you go the opposite way. Far!

06:47.407 --> 06:49.158
Opposite means the same.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.910
Go!

06:53.204 --> 06:54.872
Ugh. Dumbasses.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.416
We can still hear you.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.835
Oh, jeez, well, stop listening, damn it!

06:58.918 --> 07:01.671
- Yes, sir.
- Don't say, "Yes, sir."

07:01.754 --> 07:04.298
- No, sir.
- Don't say nothing!

07:04.382 --> 07:06.092
Silence, sir.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.513
Now it's time for the real hunt.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.140
Love.

07:12.223 --> 07:15.184
- Love?
- You! Come on.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.227
Come on.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.523
- Will you shut up!
- You shut up!

07:20.606 --> 07:21.899
I'm going to kill you.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.901
You have to find me first.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.237
Ow.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.364
Ha-ha. You shot Mertz.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.876
That's it, Tubby. You know the way.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.171
Yes, the way to the buffet.

07:43.254 --> 07:46.090
You see, that was a joke
because he's a fat man.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.885
Yes, yes, and you're just big boned.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.121
It's that crown-stealing moose
that's always making a fool out of me.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.542
Ow!

08:25.505 --> 08:26.797
No!

08:26.881 --> 08:28.841
What do you need two crowns for?

08:28.925 --> 08:30.551
What, do you think you're better than me?

08:32.386 --> 08:35.014
Oh. It's a wee little bear cub.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.892
Ain't you the sweetest--
Ow! You little bastard!

08:37.975 --> 08:40.686
Why, I… Don't make me come up there. Ow!

08:40.770 --> 08:42.480
Right in the old soft spot.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.190
I'll murderlize that bear.

08:51.322 --> 08:56.869
Okay, you got the higher ground now,
but I swear I'll be back with stilts.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.248
I must be getting close
to where the bears live,

09:00.331 --> 09:03.042
or at least
where they dump their crummy kids.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.610
How can I get over you
when you're not even here to reject me?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.241
Bean? Are you okay?

09:35.324 --> 09:36.367
You're not drinking.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.743
I brought you a beer.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.829
Oops. Sorry. I just finished it.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.914
Oh. Hey, guys, pull up a rock.

09:41.998 --> 09:42.957
Bean, what's wrong?

09:43.040 --> 09:46.460
You look like you could use the advice
of two ignorant but well-meaning friends.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.671
- I know what it is.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.257
You've been bummed out
ever since you found out

09:51.340 --> 09:54.051
that your people were cruel,
bloodthirsty savages.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.386
But you know what I say?

09:55.469 --> 09:56.554
Let it go.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.765
You're perfect
and you're beautiful and life is good.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.392
Are you drunk?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.436
I am a little, but that's not the point.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.938
Listen to me. Hey! Come here.

10:06.022 --> 10:06.981
Look at me.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.149
Listen to me.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.776
It's okay.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.321
God, your cheeks are like rubber.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.281
Rubbaba, rubbaba…

10:18.075 --> 10:19.327
It's been a long day.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.871
Let's just go home
and stare at the ceiling.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.833
It's so far and it's all uphill.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.127
And I've got corns on my bunions.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.837
Elfo, can you carry me?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.963
I know a shortcut.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.049
Hmm?

10:58.282 --> 10:59.241
These bones…

10:59.325 --> 11:02.119
animal carcasses, picnic baskets…

11:03.245 --> 11:05.790
I'd know that smell anywhere.

11:05.873 --> 11:09.418
Ursula, baby, it's me, Zøg!

11:09.502 --> 11:11.504
Uh, don't be frightened.

11:11.587 --> 11:15.549
I ain't as furry these days,
I got a haircut from Big Jo.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.842
Ah, never mind.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.552
I missed you.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.608
Uh…

11:33.275 --> 11:36.570
You know, I almost got mauled back there.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.156
Oh, you still got a mauling coming.

11:41.158 --> 11:44.495
Ooh, what is that intoxicating stank?

11:44.578 --> 11:47.832
It doesn't just attract flies.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.340
Okay, smart guy, which way to the castle?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.925
Definitely the left tunnel.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.427
Definitely the right tunnel.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.303
Fine, I'm going this way.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.473
Ah! Darkness!

12:08.394 --> 12:09.270
What the--

12:18.446 --> 12:20.489
This is kind of peaceful.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.369
Skeletons!

12:33.919 --> 12:38.048
A genuine, first edition,
near mint forest selkie?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.843
Oh, she'll be perfect for my freak show.

12:40.926 --> 12:45.097
I told you Zøg was into some sick
predilections of the earth side variety.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.599
Y'all gon' let me go now, right?

12:46.682 --> 12:48.017
Hell no.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.353
Who's going to show us
where all the undocumented badgers are?

12:51.437 --> 12:54.899
And a racist antelope
will really bring in the rubes.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.409
Yeah, see, that's why I came out here.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.536
I don't think I can be apart from you.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.829
There's this attraction.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.706
Do you know what magnets are?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.541
- No.
- We go together.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.043
You know, peanut butter and jelly?

13:14.126 --> 13:15.294
- No.
- A lock and key?

13:15.377 --> 13:16.587
- No.
- Shoes and socks?

13:16.670 --> 13:18.506
- No.
- Needle and thread?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.800
- No.
- Waffles and more waffles?

13:20.883 --> 13:21.717
Definitely not.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.888
Zøg, I spend most of my life as a bear,
I don't have a big need for metaphors.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.056
What the hell's a metaphor?

13:27.139 --> 13:29.099
Humans use them

13:29.183 --> 13:31.185
because they're afraid
to say things directly.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.479
Well, I ain't afraid of nothing no more.

13:34.230 --> 13:38.150
Ursula, I love you more
than anything else in my life,

13:38.234 --> 13:41.195
you know, except my kid. Kids.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.240
Do you know this one? Husband and wife?

13:44.323 --> 13:45.533
Uh-uh.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.535
I love you, Zøg.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.537
And I'm glad we're talking
about this because--

13:49.620 --> 13:51.372
Hey, it's that little bastard bear boy.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.208
He's been whipping pine cones at my head.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.503
Look at him, starting at the top.

13:57.586 --> 14:02.550
Spiky red hair, bulbous nose,
psychotic disposition.

14:02.633 --> 14:06.178
Moving down, ample belly, muscular calves.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.931
Eh, it's like looking at me
if I was a little less hairy.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.766
Whoa!

14:19.608 --> 14:22.069
I can't believe
this is where the big battle happened.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.197
Actually, it looks more like
a slaughter than a battle.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.991
This guy got stabbed in the back.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.410
This guy got stabbed in the front.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.788
And this guy's got 12 forks in his skull!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.164
Calm down, buddy.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.583
These are just elf bones.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.627
The actual elves
are down in Hell at the big barbecue.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.212
We barbecue elves.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.422
Go to hell, Elfo.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.756
Okay, you know what, Bean?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.384
I thought I was okay with this,
but I don't know.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.677
I don't know anymore.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.012
This looks like an elficide.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.472
There's just as many
human skeletons down here.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.391
No, those aren't human skeletons,

14:52.474 --> 14:57.187
they're elf skeletons standing
on the shoulders of other elf skeletons.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.064
I'm sorry we took your cast or whatever,

14:59.148 --> 15:01.317
but we won,
and it looks like it was a fair fight.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.776
- Hmm?

15:36.393 --> 15:38.437
But I'm too old to have another kid.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.731
Bean nearly killed me, last week!

15:40.814 --> 15:43.275
Oh. But Jasper is such a sweetie.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.985
He'll totally want to play with you.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.945
Up until he reaches 600 pounds.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.405
Then we may want to rethink things.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.657
That's not the point.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.575
How do I know he's even mine?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.705
Okay, he's mine.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.499
I ain't going to be a jerk about it.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.167
But what do I do now?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.919
Go say hello.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.672
You know, nothing
is more sexy than a good dad.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.423
Yeah, I heard that one before.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.802
Oh, Jasper!

16:12.429 --> 16:14.181
Hey there, Jasper.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.391
I'm King--

16:15.474 --> 16:17.810
Ow! Son of a…

16:17.893 --> 16:21.689
Wow, you do got a strong arm there!

16:21.772 --> 16:26.485
But maybe don't toss so much
sticks and stones at your old man, eh?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.779
I'm your dad, Jasper.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.993
You're doing great.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.330
Go on, he won't bite
if approached from the front.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.290
If he starts growling, back away quickly.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.960
Don't touch his fish
if you want to keep your fingers.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.296
You know, ah…

16:46.380 --> 16:49.216
You're not gonna catch
any trout if they see your shadow.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.343
Mmm.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.558
- Huh? Huh?
- Huh. Huh.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.148
Okay, kid number three.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.983
This one I'm going to get right.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.596
Oh, jeez.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.057
Got another Derek on my hands.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.271
Hey, that tickles.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.398
Ah, the simple life.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.902
For too long, I've been living
like a big shot fancy pants.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.279
Out here, I don't need any pants.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.948
I got everything I want right here.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.325
What about your castle?

17:56.408 --> 17:58.577
Uh, Beanie's got that under control.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.745
The giant squirrel?

17:59.828 --> 18:02.206
But if you stay here,
won't your loved ones miss you?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.708
Vip and Vap? Eh, they'll be fine.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.668
I could stay here forever.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.882
Ah. Close the window, will you?

18:15.844 --> 18:19.848
Jasper, honey,
if you can't sleep, go kill something.

18:21.558 --> 18:25.104
Bear Boy, are the angels
taking you to heaven?

18:25.187 --> 18:26.563
Is there a bear heaven?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.237
Jasper!

18:35.531 --> 18:36.698
Late-night bunny party.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.455
Half human, half bear.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.750
That's the kind of biodiversity
that pulls in the suckers.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.169
Karn sarnit!

18:49.253 --> 18:51.171
Who gives a knife to a bear cub?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.382
The lack of parental concern these days.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.140
- Jasper!
- Bear Boy!

19:02.224 --> 19:05.018
- Where are you?
- It's me, Dad.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.061
Come to Mama.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.897
If you come back,
I promise I won't yell at you.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.274
Except right now.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.317
I'll let you stay up
past your hibernation.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.154
That was a good 39-cent net.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.321
Oh, that's it.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.872
Bear Boy, come towards
the smell of this delicious cigar.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.039
Whoa!

19:27.124 --> 19:28.333
What the…

19:32.546 --> 19:33.380
Oh, dear!

19:43.974 --> 19:46.351
Poor Jasper, he's extremely flammable.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.105
- Ursula!
- Just find Jasper.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.459
Bear Boy!

20:14.546 --> 20:15.631
Jasper, no!

20:15.714 --> 20:18.592
Ah, don't cross the burning log!

20:20.010 --> 20:21.803
What'd I tell you?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.055
Jasper, climb.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.983
Ursula, give me your hand there.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.361
- Got you.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.488
Zøg!

20:39.571 --> 20:42.324
Ursula! No!

20:43.992 --> 20:45.494
What are we, cursed?

20:46.536 --> 20:49.206
Don't worry about
the family curse, Jasper.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.797
I'm not crying, boy.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.966
It's all this smoke. See?

21:00.008 --> 21:01.260
Your mom…

21:03.929 --> 21:05.681
she was a special lady…

21:05.764 --> 21:07.391
Bear… Lady Bear.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.727
Ah, what am I going to do with you now?

21:13.855 --> 21:16.942
I mean, I taught you the things
I could, what else can I do?

21:17.025 --> 21:18.777
You belong out here in the woods.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.197
You wouldn't like the castle,
there's no trees, no fishing,

21:22.281 --> 21:24.741
and honey comes in a jar
and not in a hive.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.537
Oh, you've got to go be a bear.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.790
You go that way and I'll go this way.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.506
Papa, where are you going?

21:40.590 --> 21:41.466
Oh.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.093
Jeez.

21:47.597 --> 21:48.640
Come here, Jasper.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.981
All this time you could talk?

21:56.064 --> 21:57.316
Why didn't you say nothing?

21:57.399 --> 21:59.192
Well, you never shut up.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.655
Your laugh is annoying, too.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.948
That's my boy.
