Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i>

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
Woody, I have a lot

00:06.800 --> 00:07.800
of work to do here,

00:07.800 --> 00:09.800
so please make sure       
      I'm not disturbed.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.700
WOODY:                          
Yes, ma'am.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.800
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:15.900 --> 00:17.100
Yes?

00:17.200 --> 00:18.100
Miss Howe?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.500
You want me                     
to hold business                
and personal calls?

00:20.500 --> 00:21.700
Yes.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.500
You got it.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.200
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:29.200 --> 00:30.700
Yes?

00:30.800 --> 00:32.200
Miss Howe?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.200
Uh, what if it's an emergency,

00:34.300 --> 00:35.900
or something          
      only you can handle?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.800
Woody, I'm turning the bar      
          over to you.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.500
I have complete confidence.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.500
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:49.500 --> 00:50.700
Yes?!

00:50.700 --> 00:52.400
Miss Howe?

00:52.500 --> 00:53.400
I want you to know

00:53.500 --> 00:55.300
how much I appreciate      
     your confidence in me.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.600
I won't let you down.

( <i>sighs</i> )

01:03.600 --> 01:05.900
( <i>knocking</i> )

01:06.700 --> 01:08.000
Woody, I am trying

01:08.000 --> 01:10.100
to get some work done here,   
 and you are driving me crazy!

01:10.100 --> 01:11.600
Now, get out of here,      
      and leave me alone!

( <i>sobbing</i> ):                    
I'm sorry, Miss Howe.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.700
¶ Sometimes you want to go

01:34.800 --> 01:40.100
¶ Where everybody           
    knows your name ¶

01:40.100 --> 01:44.400
¶ And they're always glad       
        you came ¶

01:44.500 --> 01:47.000
¶ You want to be        
      where you can see ¶

01:47.000 --> 01:49.700
¶ Our troubles         
    are all the same ¶

  everybody knows your name. ¶

02:10.699 --> 02:12.600
Hey, Fras,                      
new briefcase?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.400
No. It's my new         
  portable cellular telephone,

02:14.400 --> 02:16.400
the answer to every busy    
      therapist's prayers.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.500
You see, with this,
             I can instantly    
             get in touch

02:18.500 --> 02:19.600
with patients   
                in crisis.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.900
Who knows how many
              lives it may save?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Looks cool, too?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Doesn't it?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.200
Yeah.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.300
( <i>phone rings</i> )

02:25.300 --> 02:26.500
Oh, excuse me.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.400
Oh, geez.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.700
I seem to have forgotten
        the combination.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.100
( <i>phone rings</i> )

02:34.100 --> 02:36.300
I was certain I programmed      
    Lilith's birthday

02:36.300 --> 02:38.000
so I'd remember it.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.200
Oh, no?

02:40.400 --> 02:41.800
My birthday.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.700
( <i>ringing continues</i> )

02:43.700 --> 02:46.000
Frasier, that's getting         
a little annoying.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.300
Yeah, yeah.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.700
Of course.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.300
Freud's birthday.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.800
Hello. Cheers.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.600
( <i>phone rings</i> )

02:57.600 --> 02:58.800
Two drafts, Sam.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.500
Coming right up.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.900
Shouldn't you be on your way  
        to the airport?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
No. Eddie called
                from Louisville.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.200
He said the         
            performer's plane

03:03.200 --> 03:04.300
was gonna be    
                a little late

03:04.300 --> 03:05.200
so he'd meet
                    me here.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.800
Oh, you must be getting         
pretty excited, huh?

03:06.900 --> 03:08.600
Yeah. I thought
                 that ice show

03:08.600 --> 03:10.600
would never get
                 back to Boston.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.300
Yeah, it has been tough.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.300
He misses me.               
Yeah.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.200
You know? Kids miss him.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.100
Not to mention                  
that I have moved

03:17.100 --> 03:18.500
into my sexual peak.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.300
You've been there           
    since you were 12.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.700
When you find a place you like, 
why leave it?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.600
( <i>phone rings</i> )

03:25.600 --> 03:27.200
MAN:       
                     Answer the 
                     damn phone!

03:27.300 --> 03:29.400
Sorry, sorry.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
Oh, wait.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.600
Jung's address.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.700
Finally.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.100
Hello.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.100
No, there is no Itzhak here.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.100
Woody, here are your tickets.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.600
Tickets?    
            Woody gets tickets?

03:48.600 --> 03:49.900
Company season tickets.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.700
Patriots-Dolphins tonight.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.300
Two on the 40-yard line.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.100
Ooh-ooh-oh-wee!

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
Oh. You know,          
    thanks, Miss Howe.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.600
You know, you are           
 the greatest boss I ever had.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.900
( <i>clears throat</i> )

03:58.900 --> 03:59.900
I mean...

03:59.900 --> 04:01.700
you're the prettiest boss       
          I ever had.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.300
( <i>clears throat</i> )

04:04.700 --> 04:05.900
I mean, thanks.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.300
So, uh,

04:08.300 --> 04:09.900
Woodster, what time
             we leaving, bud?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.400
Well, Mr. Peterson,       
      you'd be interested

04:11.400 --> 04:12.700
in going to something like this?

04:12.700 --> 04:14.500
Yeah.       
Dit-dit-dit-dit...

04:14.500 --> 04:15.500
Fair is fair.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.100
What?           
    Now, Woody...

04:17.100 --> 04:18.500
didn't I, uh,   
                invite you

04:18.500 --> 04:20.800
to a very special occasion      
just last week?

04:20.899 --> 04:21.700
That's right, Mr. Clavin.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.000
I sure did enjoy            
    that garage sale.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Excuse me, but why do I seem

04:25.100 --> 04:26.600
to have been          
    automatically excluded?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.700
You have to go    
              home to your wife.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.700
What about your wife?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.900
You can't be this dense
         with your patients.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.800
Hey, Carla, I'm back.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.000
Hey.                    
                    Hey.

04:38.000 --> 04:38.700
Hey, everybody.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.900
N-n-not-not here.

04:39.900 --> 04:40.700
Everybody's watching.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.200
Excuse me.              
     I-I'll be right back.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.100
I just got              
    to show Eddie something.

04:44.200 --> 04:44.900
( <i>clears throat</i> )

04:48.800 --> 04:49.700
Oh, Eddie.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.700
( <i>moaning</i> )

04:52.800 --> 04:54.000
( <i>door rattling</i> )

04:59.800 --> 05:02.600
Ah, gee, it's   
                good to be home.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.900
Give me a beer,                 
Sam... here.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.600
Thanks, Sam.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.   
( <i>gasps</i> )

05:08.000 --> 05:10.600
A charm bracelet                
from Cincinnati!

05:10.600 --> 05:12.900
Yeah. There's          
      a little beer stein,

05:13.000 --> 05:14.500
little bowl   
                  of sauerkraut,

05:14.600 --> 05:16.600
and Pete Rose's head.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.300
Ooh, Carla, can I borrow it?

05:21.200 --> 05:22.300
Fat chance.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.400
This better not                 
turn my wrist green.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.600
No.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.300
Hey.

05:26.300 --> 05:27.400
Hey, buddy.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
How's the show doing?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.500
Oh, terrific.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.700
We signed a new headliner--

05:30.800 --> 05:32.500
Franzi Schrempf.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.500
Oh, you mean,          
 the East German gold medalist?

05:34.600 --> 05:35.200
That's her.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.800
She's joining the show     
        here in Boston.

05:36.900 --> 05:37.700
Sure would like
                 to meet her

05:37.800 --> 05:39.000
without having to go    
        to that stupid ice show.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Mm.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.100
You may be in luck, Norm,

05:41.100 --> 05:42.900
because I invited her      
     and some of the cast

05:42.900 --> 05:44.000
to drop by here later.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.200
Oh, boy.   
                     Hey, hey...

05:45.200 --> 05:46.600
Oh, God, she is amazing.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.800
She actually grabs the blade

05:47.800 --> 05:51.100
and touches the back            
of her head with it.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.400
Can you do this?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Hey, are the kids home?

05:58.100 --> 05:58.900
I haven't talked to them
        since I got back.

05:59.000 --> 05:59.700
I want to give
                  them a call.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.400
Oh, yeah, go ahead.             
                    All right.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.800
Just make sure         
 you identify yourself by name.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.100
Just saying, "It's Dad"

06:05.100 --> 06:06.200
leaves too much room      
         for confusion.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.200
CLIFF:                          
You know, Carla,

06:08.200 --> 06:10.700
according to the, 
              uh, <i>Weekly Gabber,</i>

06:10.700 --> 06:12.500
this Franzi Schrempf
            has affairs

06:12.500 --> 06:14.300
with every man    
              she's worked with.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.000
I'm telling you,  
              she's a man eater.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.200
Look, Clavin,                   
I'm not worried,

06:19.300 --> 06:20.500
so just shut up.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.700
There's a lot of things wrong  
          with Eddie,

06:22.700 --> 06:24.200
but I know I can trust him.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.200
We've been married          
      for over a year now,

06:26.300 --> 06:28.400
and not once          
      in that entire time

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
has his eye wandered.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.600
Well, his good eye.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.300
I'm talking completely
          over her head.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.900
I mean, she must be,
            like, triple-jointed
            or something.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.700
Hey, Eddie,                     
Eddie, come here.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.300
You know, I was just laughing  
at something stupid Cliff said.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.500
He says that this Franzi    
          has a thing

06:45.500 --> 06:47.100
for the men she works with.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.100
Says she changes lovers

06:49.100 --> 06:51.300
more times              
 than most people change socks.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
I don't have anything           
to worry about

06:53.400 --> 06:55.000
with you                        
in that area, do I?

06:55.100 --> 06:56.100
No, honey, not at all.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.400
I put a fresh pair
              on this morning.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.000
Hey, here she is.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.400
Everybody...

07:04.500 --> 07:07.100
I want you to meet
              Franzi Schrempf.

07:07.100 --> 07:07.800
( <i>hooting and chattering</i> )

07:07.900 --> 07:08.800
( <i>clapping</i> )

07:08.900 --> 07:09.400
SAM:                            
Welcome

07:09.400 --> 07:10.600
to the bar, Franzi.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.500
We're all, uh...

07:11.500 --> 07:12.700
Well, we're big fans of yours.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.800
Thank you.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.600
But we were           
        just wondering,

07:14.700 --> 07:16.000
now that you're here      
         in Boston, um,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.100
well, what are your plans?

07:17.200 --> 07:20.100
Well, while I'm here,      
I would like to wear blue jeans,

07:20.100 --> 07:23.400
see a Tom Cruise movie,     
    and eat a Big Mac.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.900
Whoa. Sexy, dumb,           
    and a cheap date.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.000
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:29.800 --> 07:31.700
Well, uh, in the

07:31.700 --> 07:32.700
spirit of detente,

07:32.800 --> 07:34.600
I wouldn't mind       
          having some arms talks

07:34.700 --> 07:35.800
with Franzi.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.500
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:37.500 --> 07:39.700
I'd like to see her try         
to control my arms.

07:39.700 --> 07:40.700
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:40.800 --> 07:42.000
I wouldn't object

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
to a little mutual 
             on-site inspection.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.200
See what kind of payload        
she can deliver.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.300
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:48.300 --> 07:50.700
Reduce missiles                 
in Western Europe.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.000
( <i>Woody laughs</i> )

08:00.200 --> 08:01.400
EDDIE:                          
Hey, Sam,

08:01.500 --> 08:03.100
she is something, eh?           
                        SAM:    
                        Yeah.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.100
You know, if I was younger,   
    taller, handsomer,

08:06.200 --> 08:07.500
and had a brain         
          in my head,

08:07.500 --> 08:10.400
I never would have          
     started this sentence.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.400
You think she's pretty,         
don't you?

08:12.500 --> 08:14.700
Well, yeah, if    
              you're into looks,

08:14.800 --> 08:16.300
which I'm not.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.900
Just don't get any ideas.

08:19.000 --> 08:19.700
Ideas?

08:19.700 --> 08:22.100
Franzi doesn't    
              even know I exist.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.000
Eddie, do you have a light?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.800
You know, I'm sort of 
          the host here tonight.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.300
I-I better take
                 care of this.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.300
Sure.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.300
( <i>indistinct chatter</i> )

08:31.300 --> 08:32.700
CLIFF:
                          Uh!

08:32.700 --> 08:34.299
Paper covers rock,

08:34.400 --> 08:35.799
and the mailman goes       
     to the Patriots game.

08:35.799 --> 08:36.799
Oh, that is absurd.

08:36.900 --> 08:37.900
You're telling me

08:37.900 --> 08:39.500
that if I took my rock
          and hurled it,

08:39.600 --> 08:40.900
it wouldn't smash   
            right through

08:40.900 --> 08:41.500
that puny piece
                 of paper?

08:41.500 --> 08:43.400
Oh, will you come on?!

08:43.400 --> 08:44.400
You're just crying baby shoes

08:44.500 --> 08:45.700
'cause you're not going     
          to the game.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.700
Oh...           
                Baby shoes...

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800
Children,   
                    children,

08:47.800 --> 08:49.400
there's a much
                  more fair way

08:49.400 --> 08:50.700
to decide this. Now,

08:50.700 --> 08:52.000
foot race to the corner     
        and back.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.200
The winner goes to the game.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.400
False start. False start!

08:55.400 --> 08:58.200
I'm running this race   
        under protest.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.200
Carla, I don't think
            you have anything

09:05.200 --> 09:06.400
to worry about
                  with Eddie.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.700
But I don't know.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.800
I get this sense of doom.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.100
Maybe it's intuition,           
and maybe it's the fact

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
that every time                 
Eddie gets excited,

09:14.200 --> 09:16.500
he starts sweating              
like a ditch digger.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.400
Mom, you'll never believe this.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.700
I'm calling you         
    from a briefcase.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.600
Yeah?

09:27.700 --> 09:29.500
Say, Franzi, uh,

09:29.600 --> 09:31.100
you know, I was
                 just thinking,

09:31.100 --> 09:32.700
seeing how you're   
            new in town,

09:32.700 --> 09:34.400
how about I show you
            our fair city?

09:34.400 --> 09:36.000
I do not think so.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.600
We have just met.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.500
That's not proper   
            in my country.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
I drive a 'Vette.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.100
I drive a Porsche.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.000
Oh, well, maybe we could        
race sometime.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.100
Oh...

09:49.200 --> 09:50.100
( <i>panting</i> )

09:50.200 --> 09:52.800
Hey, congratulations,   
        Mr. Peterson.

09:52.900 --> 09:53.900
You're the winner.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.500
Put it on my headstone.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.100
( <i>panting</i> )

09:59.200 --> 10:01.500
Well, congratulations, Norm.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.600
( <i>panting</i> )

10:02.700 --> 10:04.400
You won the first leg           
of our triathlon.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.100
Now, onto the....

10:06.200 --> 10:08.400
Now, onto the, uh, biking       
and swimming portions.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.300
Anybody know
                    this guy?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.700
We found him face down  
        at the top of the steps.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.500
Never saw him before.

10:17.900 --> 10:18.800
Oh, hey,        
                Mr. Peterson,

10:18.800 --> 10:20.900
we better hurry,    
            or we're gonna      
            miss the kickoff.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.700
What? Get out of here.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.600
What are you...?

10:22.600 --> 10:23.700
Come on, come on.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.100
Got to run.

10:25.100 --> 10:25.600
Oh, no...

10:25.700 --> 10:27.000
Woody!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.200
No, man! Wait.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.200
Excuse me.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.900
I think the guy on the steps    
would like something to drink.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.800
We don't do takeout.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.000
Hey, uh, Franzi,  
              what's the matter?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.200
Sammy doesn't spin
              your propeller?

10:50.300 --> 10:53.300
He's rude, crude                
and very stupid.

10:53.300 --> 10:57.300
I guess all the sweet,          
simple guys are taken.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.900
Don't you forget it.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.900
( <i>sighs</i> )

11:03.900 --> 11:05.000
Say, I'll bet          
     with all that skating

11:05.100 --> 11:07.500
you get pretty sore muscles.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.700
Have you ever experienced

11:08.700 --> 11:12.600
Sammy's all-American,      
     deep muscle massage?

11:12.700 --> 11:15.300
Have you ever experienced   
    knowing when to quit?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.400
( <i>laughs</i> )

11:17.600 --> 11:19.800
Are you sure you're       
     not from around here?

11:20.700 --> 11:21.700
Eddie?

11:21.700 --> 11:22.600
Yes.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.900
Would you be so kind

11:23.900 --> 11:26.200
to give me a lift back     
         to the hotel?

11:26.200 --> 11:28.100
Oh, sure, Franzi.           
        Anything.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.300
You're so sweet.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.500

CLIFF:
                          Well,

11:35.600 --> 11:37.600
there he goes, Carla.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.800
Don't say I didn't warn you.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.400
You got to give her credit.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.700
She didn't say it.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.500
Say, uh, Rebecca,               
was it a big hassle

12:05.500 --> 12:07.200
getting those company tickets   
for Woody?

12:07.200 --> 12:08.100
No.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.200
Can you get some for me?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.300
No.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.200
I get it.                       
Employees only, huh?

12:13.300 --> 12:14.800
No.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.900
Gotcha. Can't go                
to the well too often.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.600
No.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.400
Then you just don't want        
to get 'em for me?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.200
Yes.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.600
Well, no harm in asking.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.800
Man, what is with           
    these East German babes?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.800
All week long          
      I have been trying:

12:34.800 --> 12:36.400
phone calls, flowers,      
        the whole thing.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.700
What am I doing wrong?

12:37.700 --> 12:39.100
Well, Sam, I see
                no alternative.

12:39.100 --> 12:42.000
You're just going           
 to have to become a communist.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.100
What do you do?

12:43.100 --> 12:45.300
Do you apply for membership   
         or something?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.800
I cannot believe my ears.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.700
What?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.800
We're not talking               
about the Moose Lodge here.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.200
We're talking communists,

12:54.300 --> 12:56.000
the most reprehensible          
perpetrators

12:56.000 --> 12:59.400
of social and economic          
oppression ever known           
to mankind.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.500
I mean,                         
they brainwash you,

13:00.600 --> 13:03.000
they put you to work            
in some tractor factory,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
and as for your creature        
comforts, forget it.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.200
Yeah, but the stuff you had

13:10.300 --> 13:12.800
before you joined is still      
    your stuff, am I right?

13:17.600 --> 13:20.000
Ordering.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.400
What are you ordering, Carla?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.500
I forget.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.400
You know where to reach me.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.800
Carla, are you preoccupied      
or something?

13:33.600 --> 13:37.400
You don't still think           
Eddie's messing around          
with Franzi, do you?

13:37.500 --> 13:39.200
I have my suspicions.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.000
Well, what evidence             
do you have?

13:41.100 --> 13:43.000
I'll tell you what I have.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.900
I have nothing!

13:46.400 --> 13:47.700
That was the one good thing
     about Nick.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.200
With Nick,             
         I always knew for sure.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.000
How?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.300
He told me.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.600
I mean,

13:52.700 --> 13:55.300
Nick used to stick Polaroids
    in the family album.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.400
Carla, you don't have           
anything to worry about.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.600
I am telling you

14:01.600 --> 14:04.300
Franzi would never date anyone  
from that crummy ice show.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.900
I can't believe that dame!      
She said she can't see me

14:06.900 --> 14:08.800
because she's fallen      
 for some guy in the ice show.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.400
( <i>gasps</i> )

14:09.400 --> 14:10.900
Carla, she's probably           
just saying that

14:11.000 --> 14:12.900
because she wants               
to get Sam to quit bugging her.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.300
I'll have to remember           
that one.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.500
She's dating somebody,
          all right.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.800
Get a load of this      
        little tidbit of gossip.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.500
"One international skating star
 was seen spooning spaghetti

14:24.500 --> 14:27.700
with a short, dark,    
         melon-faced companion."

14:27.700 --> 14:28.700
Eddie!

14:28.700 --> 14:30.000
SAM:               
             Oh, come on, Carla.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.900
"Short, dark, melon-faced"?

14:31.900 --> 14:33.700
I mean, that could be anybody  
          in the show.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, guess that explains why

14:35.000 --> 14:37.200
it's not one of the more        
popular ice shows.

14:40.900 --> 14:46.200
That no-good, two-timing        
scum-sucking, son of a...

14:59.700 --> 15:03.600
Hey, do you mind if I borrow  
    Carla here for a minute?

15:03.700 --> 15:04.900
No problem.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.600
It'll give me time          
     to look for my tooth.

Hey, Frasier, help him
          out there, will ya?

Will you sit down?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.200
Now, what the hell              
do you think you're doing?

15:17.200 --> 15:18.800
I'm killing           
          the horny little frog!

15:18.800 --> 15:20.100
Just come on.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.800
Come here, will you?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.100
Look, murder is not the answer

15:23.200 --> 15:24.800
to every one                    
of life's little problems,

15:24.800 --> 15:26.100
you know that?

15:26.100 --> 15:27.300
First of all,

15:27.300 --> 15:29.100
you don't even know         
    if he did anything wrong,

15:29.100 --> 15:31.800
and second, if he was   
        a little tempted,

15:31.900 --> 15:33.500
maybe you pushed
                him into it.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.000
Oh, what are you                
talking about?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.100
Did you ever think

15:36.200 --> 15:38.300
that maybe you aren't   
        exactly nice to the guy?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.200
Sammy, you know me.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.800
This is as nice                 
as it gets.

15:41.800 --> 15:46.000
But this is the way             
you handle everything           
in your life,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.600
and it never works.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.600
Okay, O God           
     of Good Relationships,

15:50.600 --> 15:52.600
what do you suggest I do?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.500
Carla, Carla,

15:54.600 --> 15:58.900
you got to let Eddie know   
    how you feel inside.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.800
You must embrace him

16:00.800 --> 16:02.200
not, not just   
                with your heart,

16:02.300 --> 16:03.800
but with your very soul.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.100
Give unto him and     
          he will give unto you.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.100
Okay, no more for this clown.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.400
Listen,

16:16.500 --> 16:19.800
I'm talking           
 about the occasional back rub,

16:19.900 --> 16:22.100
the general all-around          
pampering.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.900
You know, maybe buy one of      
 those low-cut, frilly dresses.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.100
Oh, you mean

16:27.100 --> 16:29.300
that "total woman" BS?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.800
I find that           
     completely repulsive.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.500
Well, that explains

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
all the men beating down    
     your door, doesn't it?

16:36.500 --> 16:40.500
Listen, you got to become 
      the ideal woman, you know?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.400
Treat him like a god,   
        cater to his every whim.

16:43.400 --> 16:47.200
Oh, yuck! I can't do that.      
I can't do frilly.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.400
You know what they say.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.800
"You can catch more flies     
  with honey than with vinegar."

16:50.900 --> 16:52.400
Maybe I shouldn't           
      be butting in here,

16:52.400 --> 16:55.500
but you can catch the most      
      with dead squirrels.

17:05.599 --> 17:06.800
Come on.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.900
Guys, guys,

17:07.900 --> 17:10.599
I am not going                  
to do this, okay?

17:10.700 --> 17:12.800
I'm going to get to the         
bottom of it my own way.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.700
So, I say to this patient,

17:15.700 --> 17:18.099
"Look, you're never going       
to get well

17:18.099 --> 17:19.700
until you get over              
this paranoia."

17:19.700 --> 17:22.200
And he says to me,              
"I was afraid you'd say that."

17:26.900 --> 17:28.200
Well, you had to be there.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.300
Your phone is ringing.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.000
Ooh.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.700
Why did you attack me      
        like that?

17:39.800 --> 17:40.600
I'm sorry, Eddie.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.800
Look, I've been very tense      
            lately.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.500
Can I ask you something?

17:45.500 --> 17:46.900
Sure.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.600
Are you happy with me?

17:48.600 --> 17:49.500
Boy, am I.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.800
No complaints?

17:50.900 --> 17:51.600
Not one complaint.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.300
You're lying.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.800
Everybody has one complaint.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.100
I want one complaint

17:55.100 --> 17:57.600
or I'm not going                
to believe you're happy.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.000
Well, okay.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.400
What?

18:00.400 --> 18:01.300
Remember the other night

18:01.400 --> 18:02.500
when I asked you
                if I could have

18:02.600 --> 18:04.300
a few buddies over
              for poker,

18:04.300 --> 18:07.100
and you shoved my face
          into the refrigerator?

18:07.200 --> 18:09.300
Well, I guess      
             I didn't like that.

18:10.500 --> 18:15.000
Listen, Eddie, I want you       
to promise me something.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.800
I want you                      
to promise me

18:17.900 --> 18:22.700
that if you ever find someone  
who makes you happier than I do

18:22.700 --> 18:24.000
that you'll tell me.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.800
Oh, yeah, right.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.000
What do you mean by that?

18:26.100 --> 18:26.700
You'd kill me.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.900
No, I won't.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.800
Now tell me the truth.          
Are you having an affair?

18:29.800 --> 18:30.700
No!

18:30.700 --> 18:31.900
Did you believe me

18:32.000 --> 18:33.200
when I said           
      I wouldn't kill you?

18:33.200 --> 18:35.000
No!       
Then if you were having         
an affair,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.400
you would still be saying no!

18:36.400 --> 18:38.100
Yes! And if I weren't   
        having a affair,

18:38.100 --> 18:39.200
I'd still say no!

18:40.600 --> 18:43.900
Honey, look, I got    
          to tell you something.

18:43.900 --> 18:47.200
I have a real bad headache
      from this conversation.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.900
I need to lie down
              in a dark room.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.200
Where do I go for frilly?

19:04.900 --> 19:08.200
All right,                      
I will see your nickel

19:08.200 --> 19:11.600
and I'll raise you              
a nickel.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.900
Too rich for my blood.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.300
Hey, honey,           
      more chips and dip.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.300
Right away,                     
sweetheart.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.200
Hey, Ed, what's   
              with the old lady?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.900
Why is she     
                 acting so nice?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.600
I got no idea.         
 She's been doing it all week.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.600
But I got no idea           
    how a car works either,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.100
but I don't mind riding in one, 
              eh?

19:33.100 --> 19:36.300
Shades of the Algonquin         
Roundtable.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.200
Here you are, sweetheart.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.100
Just the way you like it.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.700
Oh, thanks. I thought   
        you forgot us.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.700
Oh, no! I was just carrying   
another keg in from the garage.

19:55.400 --> 19:55.800
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

19:55.900 --> 19:59.100
Oh, let me get that, baby face.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.100
And when you're through with  
that, could you grab me a beer?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.600
Anything you want.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.100
Me, too, please.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.700
What do I look like,            
a waitress?

20:15.700 --> 20:17.200
Oh, Sam, thank God              
it's you.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.500
I think I'm hemorrhaging.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.700
Don't worry about it.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.100
I got some great news,
          for you at least.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.400
I went down to Franzi's         
dressing room,

20:25.400 --> 20:26.800
give her one last chance.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.100
Guess who was there.      
         Her boyfriend.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.900
Her boyfriend was there?

20:30.900 --> 20:31.700
Yeah, yeah.

20:31.700 --> 20:32.500
And Eddie's here?

20:32.500 --> 20:34.600
Hey, Carla, beer me!

20:34.700 --> 20:35.800
You think               
Eddie looks like a melon.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.000
Boy, I tell you,

20:37.100 --> 20:38.600
you put a cantaloupe      
  up next to that guy's face,

20:38.700 --> 20:40.900
I defy you              
    to tell the difference.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.900
Hey, Carla,

20:41.900 --> 20:43.800
Carla, what are you             
doing out there,

20:43.800 --> 20:46.500
growing the hops?

20:46.500 --> 20:49.000
Right away, dear.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.900
You know, maybe I'll join them  
for a couple of hands of cards.

20:50.900 --> 20:51.900
Don't bother.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.700
The game's just         
    about to break up.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.500
Thanks for the warning.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.800
Hey, honey, we're running       
      a little low on dip.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.500
You want some dip?  
Mm-hmm.

21:01.500 --> 21:05.400
Here's your dip               
  and your chips and your drinks

21:05.400 --> 21:07.200
and your cards.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.100
You want 'em?          
        Help yourselves.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.800
I don't know about you guys.  
      I'm a little bushed.

21:22.900 --> 21:26.300
You know, we really must get    
together like this more often.

21:26.400 --> 21:30.200
Oh, for God's sake, Norm.   
    Let the dog have the dip.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.500
Now what the hell           
      was that all about?!

21:37.600 --> 21:40.200
You never laid a hand   
        on that Franzi, did you?

21:40.200 --> 21:42.100
Did you kiss her even?
          Did you pinch her?

21:42.100 --> 21:43.000
Did you do anything?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.300
No, I swear it!

21:44.400 --> 21:46.400
How could you           
        humiliate me like that?!

21:47.600 --> 21:49.100
Franzi?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.700
Carla, is that                  
what you're all upset about?

21:50.700 --> 21:52.500
You think there's something     
going on

21:52.500 --> 21:54.600
between me and Franzi?

21:54.700 --> 21:57.700
Listen, if that woman      
     threw herself at me,

21:57.700 --> 21:59.400
I would have nothing      
        to do with her.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.400
In fact, today at rehearsal     
I saw how inhuman she could be.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.400
She humiliated                  
one of the guys

22:04.400 --> 22:06.100
just because he made            
a little mistake.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.600
Chewed him out         
     in front of everyone.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.300
Actually spit on him.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.900
If it upset you so much,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.300
why didn't you 
                 defend the guy?

22:12.300 --> 22:14.100
I was the guy!

22:16.100 --> 22:17.400
So nothing was going on

22:17.400 --> 22:20.100
and you let me walk around
      like Debbie Reynolds.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.700
Why didn't you stop me?!

22:21.800 --> 22:24.000
I thought maybe you were
        pregnant again

22:24.000 --> 22:25.700
and this was your way      
         of telling me.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.900
Well, you didn't have      
      to like it so much.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.300
Like it?              
          It gave me the creeps.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.800
Well, you certainly seemed      
to like it

22:31.900 --> 22:34.800
when you were making            
all those stupid cracks         
in front of your friends.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.100
Well, you know 
                 the competition

22:36.200 --> 22:37.800
to be witty            
         in front of those guys.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.500
Besides, honey, I mean,

22:44.600 --> 22:47.800
isn't the important thing   
    I've been faithful to ya?

22:49.700 --> 22:52.100
You have been, haven't you?

22:52.100 --> 22:53.300
Yeah.

22:53.300 --> 22:57.200
Guess I kinda lost              
sight of that.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.100
I was never married to anyone   
who was faithful before.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.900
( <i>scoffs</i> )

23:07.000 --> 23:10.900
You're really                   
a good guy, Eddie.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.600
I don't deserve you,

23:12.700 --> 23:14.200
but I'm going                   
to try to from now on.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.000
I'm going to be                 
the perfect wife.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.700
I don't want you       
         to be the perfect wife.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.200
I want the girl
                 I married:

23:19.300 --> 23:23.200
feisty, strong-willed,     
     and, well, downright nasty.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.400
In a beautiful way.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.000
You really mean that, Eddie?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.300
Oh, you bet I do.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.100
Then get your sorry butt        
into the kitchen.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.700
