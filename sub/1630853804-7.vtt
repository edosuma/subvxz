00:08.467 --> 00:10.386
[Adult Tiff] "Whence come I
and whither go I?

00:10.469 --> 00:14.223
That is the great,
unfathomable question,

00:14.306 --> 00:16.350
the same for every one of us.

00:16.434 --> 00:18.561
And science has
no answer to it,"

00:18.644 --> 00:22.106
Max Planck said,
and he's correct.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.067
Because ultimately,
it is not up to science,

00:25.151 --> 00:29.697
nor our teachers, not even our
parents-- sorry Mom and Dad.

- [camera shutter clicking]
- Only we, fellow members

00:33.325 --> 00:37.997
of the class of 1994,
can decide who we become.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.125
Here's another turn of phrase
that I am fond of.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.003
"A roll's a roll,
and a toll's a toll.

00:44.086 --> 00:47.923
And if I don't get no tolls,
I don't eat no rolls.”

00:48.007 --> 00:50.718
Little John speaks these words
at the toll bridge,

00:50.801 --> 00:54.930
because the success of
his livelihood is directly tied

00:55.014 --> 00:57.224
to the success of his very life.

00:57.308 --> 01:00.895
We, too, have the freedom
to choose vocations so vital,

01:00.978 --> 01:03.147
to resoundingly answer
the question

01:03.230 --> 01:06.025
"What will I become?"

01:06.108 --> 01:09.320
Answer well,
and these choices will feed us,

01:09.403 --> 01:12.698
sustain us and fulfill us.

01:12.782 --> 01:16.160
Mail it in,
and no rolls for you.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.497
So choose wisely,
class of 1994,

01:19.580 --> 01:24.210
because "with great power
comes great responsibility."

01:24.293 --> 01:25.628

- Yeah. Maybe.

And according to Dylan,

there was no guarantee
that he could treat it anyway.

you feel it's real so that

a coffee maker here.

Oh, um,

05:45.262 --> 05:47.806
can we bring you anything back?

a better word.

through my shit without asking.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.056
Two: bedroom-- off limits.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.850
Three:
if there's a towel hanging

06:31.934 --> 06:33.769
- from the door, it means knock.
- Why?

be naked or something?

[rock music plays quietly]

06:53.080 --> 06:55.332
That's a weird way
to feel about stuff.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.297
What if I told you
that was a perfectly fine way

07:02.381 --> 07:04.550
to feel about stuff?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.718
That there's

07:06.802 --> 07:09.555
no one right answer at all
when it comes to feeling things?

I'd say that's a lot
to get from a coffee mug.

- You're so focused
on who you should be

that you have no idea

I'd like a fellowship

or a research grant
to do something...

groundbreaking.

is gonna make you whole,
make you feel different,

you're just gonna be you

08:10.574 --> 08:12.492
on everything
that's going on around you

because you are so focused
on the future?

Is that what you really want?

08:17.372 --> 08:20.792
Your life to be lived
for the approval of others?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.422
Is Mom not proud of you
for some reason?

Is it your hair?

08:27.174 --> 08:29.259

- You're misunderstanding me.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.596
What I'm telling you
is a good thing.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.932
It means you have time.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.059
Time to dance, time to play,

08:40.103 --> 08:42.022
Exactly like Russ.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.489
Fun is good.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.492
Hell, more than that.
Fun matters.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.328
Having real friends matter.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.205
That's the speech
someone should have given

08:58.288 --> 08:59.706
at the end of high school.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.250
I have fun.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.168
I have friends.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.172
- What?
- They're your coworkers.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.590
Why are you saying all of this?

09:09.925 --> 09:11.843
You did do something,
didn't you?

09:11.927 --> 09:13.637
What happened?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.056
I...

09:16.139 --> 09:18.058
I just...

09:18.141 --> 09:21.270
I want you to have the
head start that I didn't have.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.774
And frankly, I'm jealous.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.151
It took me reaching my twenties
to realize this,

09:28.235 --> 09:29.778
and now look at me.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.114
Yeah, Mom must be thrilled.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.324
Look, there's no easy way
to say this,

09:34.408 --> 09:36.493
but she is not
who you think she is.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.745
You just love blaming Mom
for your problems, don't you?

09:38.829 --> 09:40.956
You're adopted.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.256
Stop it. It's not funny.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.594
There is absolutely nothing
to feel bad about.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.888
Ultimately,
this is a good thing.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.890
We find out our sophomore year.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.642
- You're messing with me.

my grandmother is, so...

10:46.355 --> 10:47.981
What?

10:50.359 --> 10:52.861
Nice.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.529
You're so going to Hell,
by the way.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.156
[laughs softly]
Nah.

to the same place, so...

11:20.389 --> 11:21.848
Fuck.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.770
I guess that's my grave.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.819
What do you think
I look like down there?

11:37.489 --> 11:39.950
I mean, am I just bones?

11:40.033 --> 11:43.662
Well, depends on
how good your coffin is,

11:43.745 --> 11:45.705
but I'd say your eyeballs
are definitely gone.
